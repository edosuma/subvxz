00:30.989 --> 00:32.741


00:32.824 --> 00:34.534
Well, I'm off to the pet store.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.828
Turns out, I didn't solve
their rat problem.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.580
I solved their gerbil problem.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.123
Dang ol' jury duty, man.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.583
Well, I'm right behind you.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.128
I gotta get to the office
to work on my presentation to Buck.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.505
I'm trying to convince him
to put in a new patio

00:47.589 --> 00:50.008
where customers can test drive the grills.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.886
People are more likely to listen
to your ideas

00:52.969 --> 00:55.638
if you make eye contact
and say their name.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.890
Hank...

00:57.140 --> 00:58.141
Stupid lottery.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.934
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.728
I live in hillbilly neighborhood,

01:01.811 --> 01:03.688
I buy ticket in crap part of town...

01:03.772 --> 01:07.025
Buying lottery tickets
is like buying health insurance.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.401
A sucker's game.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.529
How else am I supposed to rise
above this mediocre existence?

01:11.613 --> 01:13.656
I already try marrying into money.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.033
Minh lied to me.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.911
Hey, Kahn, I know the secret to success.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.537
Hard work.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.707
Aw, I leaned in for that, too.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.209
Yeah, man.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.129
Hard work fine for you sweat stains,
but I'm meant for better things.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.672
I need new lucky numbers.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.258
Hey, Dauterive,
what date your wife leave you?

01:32.884 --> 01:34.969
I'll get it.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.054
Don't answer it.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.973
This is exactly why we got caller ID.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.767
To weed out the un-wantables.

01:40.850 --> 01:41.976
"Out of area?"

01:42.060 --> 01:43.895
I say "out of luck."

01:43.978 --> 01:46.564
Wow. Can I not answer the next call?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.025
Sure. I should tell Nancy about this.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.195
I have just ended
the telemarketing industry as we know it.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.364


01:54.447 --> 01:56.199


01:56.658 --> 01:58.952
Huh? Maybe she's not home.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.954
But her car's in the driveway.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.374
Oh, there she is.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.421
You've been screened.

02:14.050 --> 02:19.013
So as you can see, we can use
last month's unexpected cold snap profits

02:19.097 --> 02:21.182
to build a test grill patio.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.727
I figure instead of just seeing pictures
of char patterns,

02:24.811 --> 02:27.355
customers can actually live them.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.359
Where did I lose you, sir?

02:31.442 --> 02:32.360
What?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.154
Oh, I'm sorry, Ol' Top.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.573
I just got no head for business right now.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.200
Last night, I was out
with one of my lady friends,

02:39.284 --> 02:40.952
and the bartender asked me

02:41.035 --> 02:43.580
what my granddaughter would like to drink.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.916
They used to ask what my daughter wanted.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.627
Yeah, well, maybe you need
to clear your head

02:49.711 --> 02:51.796
for an important decision like this.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.465
You know, I'm going over
to Scrubby's car wash tonight

02:54.549 --> 02:55.550
for cruise night.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.635
That's always a good time.
Why don't you come along?

02:57.719 --> 02:58.970
They still do that?

02:59.053 --> 03:01.556
I haven't been there
since my first girlfriend

03:01.639 --> 03:03.933
threw up Tickled Pink all over my Mustang.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.143
I'm in.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.026
Aw, stupid boss make me stay late again.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.278
I know he still mad
'cause I tried to wipe off

03:15.361 --> 03:17.697
his wife's birthmark
at last year's Christmas party.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.657
That not your fault, Kahn.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.243
Everyone there thought
it was barbecue sauce.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.746
Oh, life so unfair.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.457
Is it too much to ask that when I walk by

03:27.540 --> 03:31.252
people say, "Look at that lucky bastard.
I hate him."

03:31.336 --> 03:34.505
-<i>Money, money, money...</i>
-Quick, Minh, turn up the TV.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.133
<i>Steak and lobster again.</i>

03:37.342 --> 03:38.635
<i>Am I tired of it?</i>

03:38.718 --> 03:40.261
<i>You bet I'm not.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:43.514
<i>Friends, you too can be rich
like Dr. Money</i>

03:43.598 --> 03:47.602
<i>and have champagne for breakfast
and caviar for your cats.</i>

03:47.685 --> 03:50.396
<i>How much return
do you want for your investment?</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:52.899
<i>One hundred percent? Two hundred percent?</i>

03:52.982 --> 03:56.903
<i>Okay, Mr. Hard Bargain, 400 percent.</i>

03:56.986 --> 04:00.156
<i>And all by just walking out
to your mailbox.</i>

04:00.240 --> 04:03.201
<i>Of course, walking to mailbox
not so easy...</i>

04:03.284 --> 04:05.870
<i>when your mansion this big.</i>

04:18.841 --> 04:19.759
Hey, Bob,

04:19.842 --> 04:23.304
want me to help you wind that thing up
so you can drive it home?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.890
Good one, Hank.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.267
Because I'll do it.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.477
Okay, Hank, you went past the joke.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.315
Oh, hey, Mr. Strickland,
glad you could make it.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.777
We were making fun of Bob Choate's
Chevelle if you want to join in.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.820
Choate's here?

04:38.903 --> 04:41.281
Aw, dang, I slept with his wife.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.407
Hey, nice car.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.033
You gonna give me a ride sometime?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.576
Hey, dang ol'... yo.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.044
Hey.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.508
They didn't even give my Caddy
a second look.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.055
Uh, today I get stuck
in elevator for six hours.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.433
Best day of my career.

05:08.516 --> 05:12.145
Ah, Kahn, you got a serious case
of the blues.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.731
-You better see a doctor.
-Wha...

05:14.814 --> 05:16.065
Oh.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.111
<i>Congratulations, future millionaire.</i>

05:20.403 --> 05:21.321
<i>Before we begin,</i>

05:21.404 --> 05:24.866
<i>I must ask you to lower your blinds
and pull your curtains,</i>

05:24.949 --> 05:29.245
<i>so that only you can benefit
from Dr. Money's wealth secrets.</i>

05:29.329 --> 05:31.289
<i>Tell me, what would you rather do?</i>

05:31.372 --> 05:34.167
<i>Work hard all your life for peanuts,</i>

05:34.250 --> 05:36.085
<i>or get rich by doing this?</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:38.838
<i>Owning a turnkey operation.</i>

05:39.255 --> 05:42.467
<i>What is a turnkey operation, Dr. Money?</i>

05:42.550 --> 05:44.218
<i>I'm glad you asked, Amber.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:47.513
<i>A turnkey operation
is a business that runs itself</i>

05:47.597 --> 05:51.726
<i>while you just reap the rewards
for doing absolutely nothing.</i>

05:52.310 --> 05:53.311
<i>Dr. Money,</i>

05:53.394 --> 05:56.147
<i>do you think I could own
a turnkey operation?</i>

05:56.230 --> 05:57.857
<i>Absolutely, Rio.</i>

05:57.940 --> 05:59.442
<i>This is America.</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:01.819
<i>All you have to do is leverage your home,</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:05.406
<i>car or other assets
into a no-money down loan.</i>

06:05.490 --> 06:07.116
<i>Wow.</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:13.206
Oh, of course, a turnkey operation.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.458
Now we just need to find one.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.836
Why wouldn't Nancy take my call?
I'm her best friend.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.047
And she's one of my friends.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.383
Maybe she just didn't feel like talking.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.759
Nancy? Please.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.136
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.430
Maybe she's mad at me for some reason.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.890
You should ask her...

06:30.973 --> 06:33.643
Oh, right, she won't pick up the phone.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.603
Well, there's only one alternative.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.940
We are gonna stand outside that house
and spy on her.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.864
I wish I knew how it felt
to be a classic car

06:46.948 --> 06:50.326
that everyone loved
and wanted to wash with a sponge.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.702
Wish granted.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.335
Yeah, feast your eyes

06:59.419 --> 07:04.340
on my mint condition
1969 Plymouth Barracuda, Ol' Top.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.968
Well, you gals

07:07.051 --> 07:09.387
look pretty enough to be on a mud flap.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.805
Want a ride?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.853
I wonder if that's the line
that charmed Bob Choate's wife.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.567
Hey, buddy.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.570
Dang it, Kahn, you can't just cut
to the front of the line.

07:25.653 --> 07:29.991
Oh, are you saying I act
like I own the place?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.242
Well, guess what...

07:32.160 --> 07:33.494
I do.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.246
See, I need to get rich

07:35.329 --> 07:38.416
and once I found out
you dumb rednecks pay someone else

07:38.499 --> 07:43.254
so you can wash your own car,
I knew I'd found my turnkey gold mine.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.174
Hey. You guys. No loitering.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.592
This not a coffee shop.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.386
-You pay, spray, then go away.
-Oh, let's go.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.263
Come on, babe.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.806
Come again.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.442
I don't get it, Kahn.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.195
How in the world did you wind up
buying Scrubby's?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.821
By not listening to you.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.115
You think hard work is secret to success,

08:11.199 --> 08:13.659
but I get second opinion from Dr. Money.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.204
I just leverage house to raise capital,

08:16.287 --> 08:18.664
and then find turnkey owner
with a little problem.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.665
Glug-glug-glug.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.211
Six martinis later, I own Scrubby's.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.755
Now I'm on Easy Street.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.007
I show you.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.426
There are no shortcuts. Trust me, Kahn.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.928
-You're gonna see I'm...
-What, Hank?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.931
I can't hear you over jangling of success.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.853
Oh, Minh, come here.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.900
You ever make love to a future millionaire
on pile of quarters?

08:45.983 --> 08:49.487
No. But ask me again tomorrow morning.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.865
Whoo!

08:52.949 --> 08:54.909
Look at all these quarters, Minh.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.452
We finally on our way.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.496
Ooh, what are we gonna buy first?

08:58.579 --> 09:01.207
Oh. We get full-body CAT scans.

09:01.290 --> 09:05.461
Yes. And then buy Super Bowl ad
to tell my old boss to go to hell.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.719
This bed full of quarters is great,
but... can it really make us happy?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.638
Well, you right.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.848
We need more quarters.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.476
<i>So you want to make even more money?</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:21.978
<i>Well, I say,</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:23.854
<i>take a shortcut.</i>

09:25.273 --> 09:26.816
Shortcut. Yes.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.025
I knew Hank Hill a moron.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.161
Whoo-hoo!

09:39.245 --> 09:40.454
Floor it, Buck!

09:44.792 --> 09:47.295
Okay. On my signal, you dial.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.881
Then Joseph will check the caller ID
and say it's me.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.009
Then Nancy will say, "Peggy?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.595
I don't want to talk to her because of X."

09:55.678 --> 09:56.804
I don't know, Mom.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.640
And, besides, I don't even think
we can hear them.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.977
You're right.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.562
This isn't gonna work.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.732
We are going inside.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.328
Oh, Minh, great shortcut.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.622
We got spray time cut in half.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.707
Half the time, twice the money.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.003
It gonna cost five dollars
to vacuum that seat.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.050
<i>♪ Head, thorax ♪</i>

10:34.133 --> 10:36.177
<i>♪ Knees and toes, knees and toes ♪</i>

10:36.260 --> 10:38.095
Hey, rednecks!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.472
No buckets.

10:39.889 --> 10:40.973
You pay for spray.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.100
Not use free water.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.436
Kahn. What in the hell are you doing?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.855
If you not putting a quarter
in something, move on.

10:47.938 --> 10:51.275
The sprayer only gives a couple of seconds
of spray for a quarter.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.528
Yeah. And the change machine
only gives three quarters for a dollar.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.113
No soap. Cold water...

10:56.197 --> 10:59.533
Ah, so solly. No speakee Engrish.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.579
He speaks English.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.332
Dang it, Kahn,
you're just asking for a phone call

11:06.415 --> 11:07.583
to the Better Business Bureau.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.336
Quarter. Quarter.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.050
<i>Adios,</i> freeloaders.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.104
That do anything?

11:28.437 --> 11:30.606
-Little bit?
-Nothing.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.360
Our shortcut drive away
our loyal redneck customer base.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.737
We gonna lose our heavily-mortgaged house.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.408
Oh, Minh. I can't live in a world
where Hank Hill is right.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.828
Damn that Kahn.

11:43.911 --> 11:47.206
I had to use all of Nancy's body wash
just to clean the hood.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.252
Hank, what in the hell happened
to Scrubby's?

11:51.335 --> 11:54.380
There's no one there for me
to show off my new jalopy to.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.923
Well, Mr. Strickland,

11:56.006 --> 11:58.426
I'm sorry to inform you
that my neighbor, Kahn,

11:58.509 --> 12:00.594
recently purchased Scrubby's.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.179
It's fallen on hard times.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.015
Just when the sun started shining again,

12:05.099 --> 12:08.519
someone throws a burlap sack over my head
and beats me with a pipe.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.896
Yep. It's just a matter of time

12:10.980 --> 12:14.692
till Kahn will have to close the doors
and destroy cruise night altogether.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.653
Dang it. I'm gonna have
a little talk about business

12:17.737 --> 12:18.946
with this Kahn person.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.243
I wonder if he's gonna get
the "Slow and steady wins the race"

12:24.326 --> 12:26.996
or the "Hard work
is its own reward" speech.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.748
Either one's a winner.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.501
Ah, look at that.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.338
Buck's giving Kahn a three-minute MBA,
I tell you what.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.174
You know, you can even learn something

12:38.257 --> 12:40.676
from the back of Mr. Strickland's head.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.012
They're shaking hands.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.973
Kiss him... Kiss him...

12:46.432 --> 12:49.185
Nope. It appears to be just the handshake.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.480
Okay, Ol' Top.
I got everything under control.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.691
Well, this calls for a beer.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.568
Yeah. Don't stay up too late, Hank,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.612
'cause you got to report down
to the car wash

12:59.695 --> 13:01.030
first thing in the morning.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.698
Report?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.283
But... uh... uh...

13:04.366 --> 13:05.326
That's right.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.454
Scrubby's is part
of the Strickland family now.

13:08.537 --> 13:12.875
I talked some sense into Kahn's head,
and now I'm majority owner.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.502
But... but how?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.796
You know that test grill gazebo
you've been talking about?

13:16.879 --> 13:17.922
Patio. Yes.

13:18.005 --> 13:18.964
I used that money.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.218
Hey, Hank Hill.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.928
My new employee.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.763
Better punch in early.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.771
I just can't believe this.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.648
Hank, this is crazy.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.734
You can't work for Kahn.
You can barely share a fence with him.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.820
Well, I may not be happy about it,

13:40.903 --> 13:43.614
but I'm not going to start
second-guessing Buck Strickland.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.785
Everyone thought he was crazy
when he painted propane tanks like cows.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.037
Now you wouldn't know
it was springtime without 'em.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.956
I hope you're right, Hank.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.044
Do you still have the Gribbles'
spare house key?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.046
No? Okay.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.473
Hey, redneck,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.726
when you done emptying garbage,
you go get me mango smoothie.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.270
That is not part of the job.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.314
Our job is to work hard
to get this place back in order.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.233
Your job is to work hard.

14:19.316 --> 14:24.864
My job is to sit in air-conditioned office
booking trip to Mexico with my hot wife.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.157
See what slow and steady get you,
Hank Hill?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.534
Working for me.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.537
Uh, you wait and see.
Buck knows what he's doing here.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.497
His plan is to...

14:33.581 --> 14:35.958
I don't have time for this.
I got to go snake the drains.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.835
Yeah, get to it. Chop chop.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.213
Oh, but for now on,
you call me "Big Chief."

14:41.297 --> 14:42.464
It'll never happen.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
Okay, we'll keep it informal.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.010
"Chief" is fine.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.178
Now clean up my gold mine, monkey.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.640
Ow. Bad monkey.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.748
This martini is good,

15:16.248 --> 15:19.001
but maybe it would taste better
if stirred by Hank Hill.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.920
And I can make that happen.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.046
Isn't that great?

15:22.129 --> 15:26.926
It's like Dr. Money always say,
"Have a dream, then double it."

15:27.509 --> 15:30.220
Wait. Dr. Money never say that.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.347
Where you hear that?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.682
Huh, I must have just made it up.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.520
Hey, why don't we sell how-to videos?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.023
We're Asian, we own a camera.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.320
Hello, I am Dr. Quarters.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.782
Are you tired of being a hamster
on a wheel to nowhere?

15:49.865 --> 15:52.868
Aren't you dying to tell your boss
to go to hell?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
Well, what are you waiting for?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.790
Buy my video
and learn the secret to success.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.833
Cut. Come on, ladies.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.961
Dr. Quarters is rocking your world.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.672
Look at him accordingly. Action.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.174
I was not born Dr. Quarters.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.092
Dang it, Kahn.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.927
-I'm trying to work here.
-Cut.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.303
No, keep rolling.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.389
Yes, yes, you are trying to work here.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.349
Which leads us to lesson number one.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.226
Get your own work monkey.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.644
Mine is named Hank Hill.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.604
And you can name yours whatever you like.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.648
Look, I don't know what you're doing here,

16:22.731 --> 16:24.483
but I've got customers lined up.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.779
And you will, too,
if you order my wealth-building system.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.241
What the heck are you girls doing?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.619
You don't freak the monkey.
You freak Dr. Quarters.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.295
Okay, Bobby, we're gonna need
a distraction. Ideas?

16:45.379 --> 16:48.007
Well, I saw something in history class

16:48.090 --> 16:50.009
-from the Civil War...
-Brainstorm.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.351
I don't know how,
but I still say you did it.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.439
Maybe I did it with the powers I have
that I still don't know I have.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.787
Ma, it's Mrs. Hill.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.041
-Oh, gee, I can't talk to her now.
-Here it comes.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.960
I borrowed her sweater.
I still haven't gotten it dry-cleaned.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.295
I knew it.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.548
Nancy isn't mad at me,
she just feels guilty.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.760
You know what?
I'm not being an adult about this.

17:32.843 --> 17:33.886
I'm gonna call her back.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.140
What do we do? What do we do?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.517
Don't answer it. Take out the batteries.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.522
What the heck are you two
doing in my closet?

17:47.107 --> 17:49.443
Well, my sweater's not in here, Bobby.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.613
I guess I'll just be taking this
until it turns up.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.122
The place looks great, Hank.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.666
Kahn really seems
to be getting the best out of you.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.085
Shut up, Dale.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.839
Good work, Ol' Top. Hello, ladies.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.426
Now, I'm not much to look at,
but I got a lot of money.

18:15.469 --> 18:19.765
Are you tired of being stupid rednecks
living from one paycheck to the next?

18:19.848 --> 18:23.852
Then you should buy my video
and learn how to change your life forever.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.856
Look, Kahn, I have worked real hard
to get the customers back here.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.274
Don't drive them away.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.903
Just go look at your catalogs
or whatever you do in that office

18:32.986 --> 18:34.238
and let me do my job.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.406
Oh, trying to get rid of me, are you?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.075
You trying to steal from me?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.409
Empty your pockets.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.286
I'm not gonna empty my pockets.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.163
Something to hide, huh?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.958
-Kahn, get away from me.
-Aha!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.793
A quarter. I knew it. Thief!

18:47.876 --> 18:51.088
That is my personal quarter.
I brought it from home.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.340
How many more of my quarters
you got in there?

18:53.423 --> 18:56.343
Got dang it, Kahn, that does it.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.642
Ha-ha, you can't get me, redneck.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.945
Mr. Strickland, help me!

19:15.028 --> 19:17.072
You got to learn
how to treat your customers

19:17.156 --> 19:19.241
and stop calling me your dang monkey.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.535
Dang it, Hank, leave him alone.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.453
I'm sorry, sir, but I...

19:23.745 --> 19:25.205
I just can't take it anymore.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.707
I left Jeans West

19:26.790 --> 19:31.044
to work for one of the most admired men
in Arlen business, Buck Strickland.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.006
Not for a lazy idiot that doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.757
If I don't know what I'm doing,

19:35.841 --> 19:39.303
how come I'm the one
who mortgaged his house for a carwash?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.805
How come I'm the one
wearing a jacket of quarters?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.974
How come you working for me?

19:44.057 --> 19:45.601
Not anymore I'm not.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.479
Hank, you know this carwash
is part of the Strickland family.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.398
You quit it, you're quitting Strickland.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.900
If you say so, sir.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.152
Who need him?

19:55.235 --> 19:57.529
He not know how to double up
on our dreams.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.364
That my wealth-building secret.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.367
Not bad.
I got my own little success secret.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.995
-Never kill the golden goose.
-Goose, huh?

20:05.078 --> 20:08.290
Kahn, a business thrives
on customer relations

20:08.373 --> 20:10.500
and backbreaking hard work.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.502
And that's the guy who gives it to you.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.504
Hank is the golden goose.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.008
Ah, maybe Hank can be goose and monkey.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.718
Hold up, Hank.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.928
What do you say, Ol' Top?

20:21.261 --> 20:23.180
You ready to go back to selling propane?

20:24.139 --> 20:27.184
Yes, sir, I am. But what about Scrubby's?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.436
Well, hell, I'll sell my share.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.147
You turned it around so nice,
who wouldn't want to buy it?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.608
-Now hold on a sec.
-I'll take it off your hands.

20:34.691 --> 20:39.363
I've been looking for a turnkey operation
ever since I saw an infomercial on TV.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.199
Deal. You are now majority owner.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.535
Looks like you work for me.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.830
Oh. I actually more of an idea man.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.916
Move it.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.211
Listen, first thing Monday,

20:54.294 --> 20:58.215
I want you to break ground
on that test grill patio of yours.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.299
You earned it.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.509
Well, thank you, sir.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.970
No, thank you, Ol' Top.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
All this carwash business
brought me back together...

21:05.722 --> 21:07.266
...with Bob Choates's wife.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.934
-<i>Kiss him. Kiss him.</i>
