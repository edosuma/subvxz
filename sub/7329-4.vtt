WEBVTT

00:30.786 --> 00:31.997
Here we go.

00:32.021 --> 00:33.021
Bring it down.

00:34.690 --> 00:36.034
Four damn shrimp?

00:36.058 --> 00:37.669
A couple more, and we'll have
enough for dinner.

00:37.693 --> 00:38.837
- Ugh!
- Come on, man.

00:38.861 --> 00:40.939
Where's your sense of humor?

00:40.963 --> 00:43.341
I left it
at the laser-tag arena.

00:43.365 --> 00:44.576
Now, that was a dumb idea
of yours.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.777
Ah, here we go.

00:45.801 --> 00:46.978
But the only thing dumber

00:47.002 --> 00:48.747
than your idea
to become shrimp fishermen

00:48.771 --> 00:50.582
in the Indian Ocean

00:50.606 --> 00:52.317
is me for coming with you.

00:52.341 --> 00:55.854
Oh, there's a bag
caught up in the net.

00:55.878 --> 00:57.522
Hey, maybe it's a big bag
of shrimp.

00:57.546 --> 00:59.257
Oh, my God,
I'm going to kill you

00:59.281 --> 01:01.860
and I'm going to leave
your corpse out here to rot.

01:01.884 --> 01:03.661
And when they find you,
you're gonna look like...

01:03.685 --> 01:05.430
What is that?

01:05.453 --> 01:06.498
Oh!

01:06.522 --> 01:08.183
Ugh!

01:50.232 --> 01:52.210
Tony, I know
that I am on a deadline

01:52.234 --> 01:53.711
with these
investigation reports,

01:53.735 --> 01:55.246
so the clock is redundant.

01:55.270 --> 01:57.381
When was the last time
you had a late paper?

01:57.405 --> 02:00.251
I bet you were
a wee probie, probie.

02:00.275 --> 02:02.253
Last time was never.

02:02.277 --> 02:05.223
And no PC-wiping macro virus
is going to blemish my streak.

02:05.247 --> 02:07.516
Do you hear that? Listen.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.229
Stop it with the ticktock!

02:11.253 --> 02:14.565
Oh, I'm sorry, Cap'n Hook.

02:14.589 --> 02:16.234
I didn't see any crocodiles.

02:16.258 --> 02:17.602
Maybe it's in your head.

02:17.626 --> 02:19.103
Or your heart.

02:19.127 --> 02:21.305
It's an Edgar Allan Poe
reference.

02:21.329 --> 02:22.740
That's right, I read.

02:22.764 --> 02:25.443
Maybe you got a body buried
under your floorboards.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.144
Well, the day is young.

02:27.168 --> 02:28.579
You need a body buried, McGee?

02:28.603 --> 02:29.914
Sheesh.

02:29.938 --> 02:30.948
Oh.

02:30.972 --> 02:33.417
You want to make your deadline,
and I am waiting

02:33.441 --> 02:35.820
on the status of my application
to become an agent.

02:35.844 --> 02:38.589
Oh, those applications
take forever to vet.

02:38.613 --> 02:40.191
Even then, it's conditional
upon you becoming

02:40.215 --> 02:41.526
an official citizen.

02:41.550 --> 02:43.394
But teamwork is still possible,

02:43.418 --> 02:46.564
even though I am not
an official member of the team.

02:46.588 --> 02:48.165
You catch my grift?

02:48.189 --> 02:49.500
Drift.

02:49.524 --> 02:50.868
I got heart palpitations.

02:50.892 --> 02:52.270
You really scared me.

02:52.294 --> 02:54.305
Someone dial 9-1,
and wait-wait for me to tell you

02:54.329 --> 02:55.306
to dial the last one.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.208
You know, I could access
the employment database,

02:57.232 --> 02:58.509
put a rush on your file.

02:58.533 --> 03:01.846
And I could finish your ROIs.

03:01.870 --> 03:04.181
You know, you got to dial 9
to get out of the building,

03:04.205 --> 03:06.450
so dial 9-9-1, and then wait
for me to tell you to dial

03:06.474 --> 03:07.785
- the last one.
- You also got to do.

03:07.809 --> 03:08.786
Tony's paperwork for the week.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.821
It's a long story.

03:10.845 --> 03:13.824
Tony bet me that he could erase
this virus off my computer.

03:13.848 --> 03:15.192
He cheated, I know he cheated.

03:15.216 --> 03:17.128
I just don't know how yet.

03:17.152 --> 03:18.496
Why do you find it
so hard to believe

03:18.520 --> 03:19.680
I could hack that sucker out?

03:21.823 --> 03:23.334
You cannot even work
your e-mail properly.

03:23.358 --> 03:25.002
You always reply "to all."

03:25.026 --> 03:26.237
It drives me absolutely nuts.

03:26.261 --> 03:28.072
You know, when it comes
to computers,

03:28.096 --> 03:29.859
you are almost
as incompetent as Gib...

03:32.334 --> 03:33.711
You thought Gibbs
was behind you.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.079
You know why?

03:35.103 --> 03:37.081
'Cause sneaky people
expect sneakiness.

03:37.105 --> 03:39.073
It's a vicious circle.

03:41.076 --> 03:43.087
Boss is in MTAC with Vance.

03:43.111 --> 03:45.489
Shrimping boat netted
a marine's body off the coast

03:45.513 --> 03:46.991
of Tanzania.

03:47.015 --> 03:49.994
Apparently all they found
was, uh, bones, soupy flesh,

03:50.018 --> 03:51.610
and a mangled dog tag.

03:57.592 --> 03:59.170
Somebody like to light a fire

03:59.194 --> 04:01.105
under Special Agent Dunham
in Tanzania?

04:01.129 --> 04:02.607
Yes, sir.

04:02.631 --> 04:04.375
You out of toothpicks?

04:04.399 --> 04:05.376
I pulled one earlier.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.744
I got a splinter in my cheek.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.546
Cut myself shaving this morning.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.448
You know, these things
come in threes.

04:10.472 --> 04:12.883
- You superstitious?
- I'm a little stitious.

04:12.907 --> 04:13.951
We have contact.

04:13.975 --> 04:16.454
Director Vance, Gibbs,
sorry for the delay.

04:16.478 --> 04:17.755
It's the damn satellites.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.724
You working on anything
other than that beard, Dunham?

04:19.748 --> 04:21.392
Yeah, boys and I got
a pool going

04:21.416 --> 04:22.727
to whoever grows it
the thickest.

04:22.751 --> 04:24.729
It looks like a damn
Teen Wolf convention.

04:24.753 --> 04:26.697
We saw your crime scene photos.
It's a hell of a mess.

04:26.721 --> 04:28.733
Dental records confirmed
the marine as Staff Sergeant

04:28.757 --> 04:29.734
Daniel Cryer.

04:29.758 --> 04:31.335
I talked to his former C.O.

04:31.359 --> 04:32.503
Said Cryer was sharp,

04:32.527 --> 04:34.238
had experience infiltrating
terrorist cells.

04:34.262 --> 04:35.239
Past tense?

04:35.263 --> 04:36.240
He's a deserter.

04:36.264 --> 04:37.875
Went U.A. six months back.

04:37.899 --> 04:40.711
There was a short investigation,
but he was never caught.

04:40.735 --> 04:41.946
Always a step ahead.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.781
Not surprised.
They trained him to disappear.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.783
Got a tip
he'd been spotted in Jordan.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.051
Who was your source?

04:47.075 --> 04:48.653
Former Israeli officer.

04:48.677 --> 04:50.955
Does security consulting
along the Red Sea.

04:50.979 --> 04:53.324
Claimed Cryer was hanging
his own shingle.

04:53.348 --> 04:54.659
What was he selling?

04:54.683 --> 04:56.327
Connections, and not sure

04:56.351 --> 04:58.763
of the why or the how,
but Cryer was spotted

04:58.787 --> 05:01.332
boarding a small freighter
bound for East Africa.

05:01.356 --> 05:03.234
The name of that freighter
was...

05:03.258 --> 05:04.568
The Damocles.

05:04.592 --> 05:06.504
Yes, sir, that's the one.

05:06.528 --> 05:07.805
It was lost at sea,

05:07.829 --> 05:09.540
and salvage vessels
never recovered any wreckage.

05:09.564 --> 05:11.308
Guess Cryer went down
with the ship.

05:11.332 --> 05:12.610
That would account
for him being dead.

05:12.634 --> 05:14.245
Doesn't explain
why he was wrapped in plastic.

05:14.269 --> 05:16.514
There's no way to know
what went down on board.

05:16.538 --> 05:18.416
There were no survivors.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.465
I saw the official report.
You stay close, Chad.

05:22.377 --> 05:25.890
We know someone who lived
through that shipwreck.

05:25.914 --> 05:27.792
You saw this coming.

05:27.816 --> 05:28.959
You didn't?

05:28.983 --> 05:30.995
You know her better than I do.

05:31.019 --> 05:32.763
Closer to her than anyone.

05:32.787 --> 05:35.299
Your relationship with her
father doesn't tie your hands?

05:35.323 --> 05:36.734
No, it absolutely does.

05:36.758 --> 05:38.536
So, good cop, bad cop?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.971
Plenty of ways
to break someone, Leon.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.840
I figure
she's been broken enough.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.375
Okay, good cop, bad cop.

05:44.399 --> 05:47.344
Which one are you?

05:47.368 --> 05:49.213
How's my agent
application coming?

05:49.237 --> 05:50.614
I am working my magic.

05:50.638 --> 05:52.707
Trust me, Ziva,
when I'm through, you will be...

05:54.642 --> 05:55.953
Ooh, code blue?

05:55.977 --> 05:57.788
Someone's been blackballed.

05:57.812 --> 05:59.457
They gave you the red flag.

05:59.481 --> 06:03.027
What is blue, black, and red?

06:03.051 --> 06:04.395
Zebra in a blender.

06:04.419 --> 06:05.896
That's black, white,
and red all over.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.798
- Newspaper.
- Penguin with a sunburn.

06:07.822 --> 06:10.167
Nun falling down stairs.

06:10.191 --> 06:12.536
Hey! Why have I been rejected?!

06:12.560 --> 06:15.461
Seems we have a problem.

06:23.938 --> 06:26.150
Give me everything
on Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer.

06:26.174 --> 06:28.369
You got it, boss.

06:35.683 --> 06:38.863
You red-flagged my application?

06:38.887 --> 06:41.966
There are inconsistencies
that need to be addressed.

06:41.990 --> 06:43.167
My psych evaluation?

06:43.191 --> 06:44.368
Yes.

06:44.392 --> 06:47.304
Inconsistencies
in my psychological profile?

06:47.328 --> 06:48.806
Somewhat troubling.

06:48.830 --> 06:50.207
But expected.

06:50.231 --> 06:52.510
You were held
in a prison camp for months.

06:52.534 --> 06:54.044
But you survived it, didn't you?

06:54.068 --> 06:57.114
You didn't talk about that
with the counselor.

06:57.138 --> 07:00.107
So now I'm going to talk
about it with you.

07:02.010 --> 07:04.889
You've been in the service
of two masters for too long.

07:04.913 --> 07:08.325
Your loyalty to your father and
Mossad predates anything else.

07:08.349 --> 07:10.027
My father is not an issue.

07:10.051 --> 07:12.463
Okay. You want to stay

07:12.487 --> 07:14.965
here at NCIS, let's talk.

07:14.989 --> 07:17.184
That's the price of admission.

07:22.263 --> 07:25.391
Let's start with the events
that led you to the camp.

07:27.435 --> 07:28.579
Running a diagnostic

07:28.603 --> 07:30.414
on the virus you removed
from my computer.

07:30.438 --> 07:31.749
It's gone, probie. Get over it.

07:31.773 --> 07:33.651
I can't even figure out
how the virus got in the system.

07:33.675 --> 07:35.252
Wasn't an attachment.

07:35.276 --> 07:36.754
Wasn't a Trojan horse.

07:36.778 --> 07:38.022
Did you quarantine the file?

07:38.046 --> 07:39.190
Hey, I'm a hacker.

07:39.214 --> 07:40.357
I hack.

07:40.381 --> 07:41.425
We got bigger issues.

07:41.449 --> 07:42.626
Ziva's in with Principal Vance,

07:42.650 --> 07:44.528
getting paddled
or up a creek without one.

07:44.552 --> 07:45.963
We got a dead marine, right?

07:45.987 --> 07:47.498
What do we got?

07:47.522 --> 07:48.732
All right, I'll tell you
what we got.

07:48.756 --> 07:52.236
We got Marine Staff Sergeant
Daniel Cryer.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.804
Recruited right out
of high school.

07:53.828 --> 07:56.040
Talk faster. Eliminate the dead
air between your words.

07:56.064 --> 07:57.588
My mind absorbs things
very quickly.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.778
Received training
at Camp Pendleton,

08:00.802 --> 08:02.379
then shipped out
on multiple tours

08:02.403 --> 08:03.547
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

08:03.571 --> 08:05.249
Specialized
in counterintelligence.

08:05.273 --> 08:06.851
Immaculate record
until six months ago.

08:06.875 --> 08:09.253
Unauthorized absence... failed
to report back to his firebase

08:09.277 --> 08:10.855
outside Kandahar.

08:10.879 --> 08:12.389
Stopped communicating
with family and friends.

08:12.413 --> 08:13.891
Take a breath, have a keyboard.

08:13.915 --> 08:14.992
Well done.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.260
What about the Damocles?

08:16.284 --> 08:18.429
Lost at sea about
a hundred miles off the coast

08:18.453 --> 08:19.730
of Tanzania, which was

08:19.754 --> 08:22.366
a couple hundred miles
off its charted course.

08:22.390 --> 08:25.202
They got lost at sea
before they got lost at sea.

08:25.226 --> 08:26.370
So we got Ziva

08:26.394 --> 08:27.771
on a ship
that went down somewhere

08:27.795 --> 08:29.607
it wasn't supposed to be,
and a body bag filled

08:29.631 --> 08:31.575
with goo from a dead marine that
wasn't supposed to be there.

08:31.599 --> 08:33.711
And nothing is what
it's supposed to be.

08:33.735 --> 08:36.647
Gibbs tosses us,
the investigation disappears.

08:36.671 --> 08:39.683
It's like Alien,
the Ridley Scott classic.

08:39.707 --> 08:40.985
The creepy one.

08:41.009 --> 08:42.820
As opposed
to the non-creepy ones?

08:42.844 --> 08:45.022
Well, Cameron's
was more actiony than creepy,

08:45.046 --> 08:46.357
and Fincher's was more sleepy.

08:46.381 --> 08:48.392
Jeunet's was sort of
a French-fried...

08:48.416 --> 08:49.827
I don't know what to call it.

08:49.851 --> 08:50.961
Anyway, point is, I hear

08:50.985 --> 08:52.265
skittering through
the air ducts.

08:54.188 --> 08:56.634
Ziva hasn't been Ziva
since we brought her home.

08:56.658 --> 08:58.269
Something happened
to her out there.

08:58.293 --> 09:01.405
Now we're waiting to see if
something pops out of her chest.

09:01.429 --> 09:03.420
You're speaking
metaphorically, right?

09:05.066 --> 09:06.543
Where you going? You're not
supposed to leave the bridge.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.778
I'm gonna go see Abby.

09:07.802 --> 09:11.105
We should stay in pairs.

09:16.911 --> 09:20.090
Hmm. Soothing.

09:20.114 --> 09:21.525
Are you kidding me?

09:21.549 --> 09:22.927
This is horrible.

09:22.951 --> 09:24.128
It's terrible.

09:24.152 --> 09:25.663
I don't like it at all.

09:25.687 --> 09:27.798
Well, then
I don't like it, either.

09:27.822 --> 09:30.034
What? I'm agreeing with you.

09:30.058 --> 09:31.902
Do you have any idea
what you're agreeing to?

09:31.926 --> 09:34.429
No, 'cause if you did,
you wouldn't agree.

09:35.863 --> 09:38.208
These are thermal images
of weather patterns.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.477
What we have here is a close-up
of a high-pressure system

09:40.501 --> 09:41.612
pushing into a
low-pressure area.

09:41.636 --> 09:44.648
The new air becomes
warm and moist,

09:44.672 --> 09:46.951
so while the warm air
continues to rise,

09:46.975 --> 09:49.620
the surrounding air has
to swirl in and take its place,

09:49.644 --> 09:51.388
which gives you?

09:51.412 --> 09:52.690
Snow?

09:52.714 --> 09:55.444
- Tropical storms.
- Tropical storms.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.929
Horn of Africa?

09:58.953 --> 10:00.431
This is about the Damocles.

10:00.455 --> 10:02.366
Well, what have you
been working on?

10:02.390 --> 10:05.669
Ziva said in her report that
the ship went down in a storm.

10:05.693 --> 10:06.737
Based on the date,

10:06.761 --> 10:08.205
this would have been

10:08.229 --> 10:09.840
the only weather pattern
violent enough.

10:09.864 --> 10:11.241
Yeah.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.543
But Cryer's body

10:12.567 --> 10:14.378
was found way over here.

10:14.402 --> 10:15.679
Yeah.

10:15.703 --> 10:17.638
Stop agreeing with me, McGee.

10:19.340 --> 10:21.418
Cryer's body must
have been carried

10:21.442 --> 10:24.021
by the Agulhas Current
along the coast of Africa.

10:24.045 --> 10:26.957
But the storm...
it never went that far south.

10:26.981 --> 10:29.126
It stayed in the
equatorial countercurrent.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.061
So if Cryer went down
with the ship...

10:31.085 --> 10:32.496
As far as the ship is concerned,

10:32.520 --> 10:36.533
in my purely scientific,
fact-based opinion,

10:36.557 --> 10:40.104
that ship was never
anywhere near that storm.

10:40.128 --> 10:41.405
Tell me I'm wrong, McGee.

10:41.429 --> 10:43.374
Abby, I don't like it
either, but...

10:43.398 --> 10:45.342
- Don't say it.
- Abby.

10:45.366 --> 10:46.343
I got it.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.178
Using your calculations

10:48.202 --> 10:49.646
of where the body was found,

10:49.670 --> 10:51.615
we can backtrack
the ocean current to find

10:51.639 --> 10:53.884
the exact location
where the Damocles went down.

10:53.908 --> 10:56.420
And we can tell the salvage ship
where to look for the wreckage.

10:56.444 --> 10:58.355
They should already
be there by now.

10:58.379 --> 10:59.846
I called it in like an hour ago.

11:00.948 --> 11:03.293
What's with the sushi bar?

11:03.317 --> 11:04.928
Staff Sergeant Cryer's body
was not alone

11:04.952 --> 11:06.864
on its considerable time adrift.

11:06.888 --> 11:08.165
Yum.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.733
Yeah, that's probably
what they thought

11:09.757 --> 11:11.769
when they were feeding
on his flesh.

11:11.793 --> 11:13.704
Much like insects on land,

11:13.728 --> 11:16.540
creatures of the sea have
a cyclical feeding pattern.

11:16.564 --> 11:20.277
A pattern that can help confirm
how long a body has been dead.

11:20.301 --> 11:22.179
In the case
of Staff Sergeant Cryer,

11:22.203 --> 11:23.881
approximately 16 weeks.

11:23.905 --> 11:26.583
Fits with the time frame
of the Damocles' sinking.

11:26.607 --> 11:29.953
However, drowning
was not the cause of death.

11:29.977 --> 11:33.624
Gunshot penetrated
above the left ear.

11:33.648 --> 11:36.014
Yeah, look at that.

11:38.286 --> 11:39.630
No exit.

11:39.654 --> 11:41.365
The missing jaw,
the occipital fractures.

11:41.389 --> 11:44.835
That is the exit wound.

11:44.859 --> 11:46.703
Unfortunately, we were unable
to find a slug.

11:46.727 --> 11:47.838
Yes, McGee.

11:47.862 --> 11:49.063
What is the good news?

11:50.031 --> 11:51.341
Oh, that's bad.

11:51.365 --> 11:52.676
Oh, that's really bad.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.278
Yeah, all right.

11:54.302 --> 11:55.279
Oh, Tony.

11:55.303 --> 11:56.513
Yeah, Ducky, I'll let you know

11:56.537 --> 11:57.937
if there's anything else
you can do.

12:02.910 --> 12:04.855
Your father Eli David
offered you

12:04.879 --> 12:06.757
the vacant slot
in the Kidon unit,

12:06.781 --> 12:08.425
previously held
by Michael Rivkin.

12:08.449 --> 12:10.094
That is correct.

12:10.118 --> 12:12.930
Director David had intel
that could be used

12:12.954 --> 12:14.832
to track the terrorist
Saleem Ulman...

12:14.856 --> 12:17.234
responsible for the deaths
of Americans and Israelis,

12:17.258 --> 12:18.936
including a Mossad agent.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.771
I cannot comment
on Mossad operations.

12:20.795 --> 12:22.873
I know this to be true,
because I'm the one

12:22.897 --> 12:24.141
who provided Eli with the intel.

12:24.165 --> 12:26.543
You are no longer
in the employ of Mossad.

12:26.567 --> 12:27.778
That does not change anything.

12:27.802 --> 12:30.066
That's what concerns me.

12:31.405 --> 12:34.384
All right, let's stick
to geography.

12:34.408 --> 12:36.854
You crossed
the Israeli border at Eilat.

12:36.878 --> 12:38.589
You booked passage somehow

12:38.613 --> 12:41.091
on a cargo ship out of Aqaba.

12:41.115 --> 12:42.993
You set out through the Red Sea

12:43.017 --> 12:44.661
towards the coast of Somalia.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.176
But the Damocles
never made it to port.

12:48.222 --> 12:49.466
No, it did not.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.335
Which brings me
to the first question

12:51.359 --> 12:52.803
I actually need an answer to.

12:52.827 --> 12:55.305
We recovered a body
from the Damocles,

12:55.329 --> 12:56.607
wrapped in plastic.

12:56.631 --> 12:59.409
He was already dead
before the ship went down.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.878
The question.

13:00.902 --> 13:02.631
Can you explain that?

13:03.938 --> 13:06.817
Occasionally, people die
on board on a ship in transit.

13:06.841 --> 13:09.153
In most cases,
the corpse is wrapped

13:09.177 --> 13:11.121
and then stored in a freezer.

13:11.145 --> 13:13.136
This body had
a bullet hole in it.

13:14.982 --> 13:16.693
I want to know how.

13:16.717 --> 13:19.763
Staff Sergeant
Daniel Cryer died.

13:19.787 --> 13:21.482
Yeah?

13:25.293 --> 13:26.603
What do we got?

13:26.627 --> 13:29.840
Salvage ships finally located
the Damocles.

13:29.864 --> 13:33.823
Found 18 more bodies
in a cargo space.

13:35.069 --> 13:37.162
Looks like the entire crew
was executed.

13:59.861 --> 14:00.904
Oh.

14:00.928 --> 14:02.987
Aren't you on the wrong side...

14:04.198 --> 14:05.909
of the glass?

14:05.933 --> 14:08.345
Oh, look at her.
Look at the state she's in.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.647
I would have thought
you'd have wanted

14:10.671 --> 14:12.449
to be in there yourself,

14:12.473 --> 14:14.385
rather than having
Vance interrogate her.

14:14.409 --> 14:17.187
Don't you have some bodies
to tend to, Duck?

14:17.211 --> 14:21.725
The evidence from the Damocles
is being unloaded as we speak.

14:21.749 --> 14:23.727
Isn't this punishing her?

14:23.751 --> 14:26.830
I mean, you're not concerned
that she might lie to you?

14:26.854 --> 14:29.345
Ah, maybe it's tough love.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.321
You do know there
are other kinds.

14:43.805 --> 14:45.282
You're charging me with a crime.

14:45.306 --> 14:47.604
Seems like one's been committed.

14:50.144 --> 14:51.855
Ship looks like a war zone.

14:51.879 --> 14:53.424
Jordanian flagship.

14:53.448 --> 14:55.626
It is not your jurisdiction.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.461
You are my jurisdiction.

14:57.485 --> 14:59.029
At least, you want to be.

14:59.053 --> 15:00.111
Have a seat.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.970
For the record,

15:06.994 --> 15:10.474
the U.S. marine among the dead...
that makes it my business.

15:10.498 --> 15:11.475
For the record,

15:11.499 --> 15:13.410
I have not yet charged you
with a crime.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.611
Then why am I here?

15:14.635 --> 15:16.680
For the record.

15:16.704 --> 15:18.194
Start recording.

15:20.408 --> 15:22.753
I should remind you
that there is such a thing

15:22.777 --> 15:24.301
as a crime of omission.

15:28.749 --> 15:31.081
Take me to the Damocles.

16:34.916 --> 16:36.884
That is no way
to begin a relationship.

16:37.919 --> 16:39.386
Cup of tea?

16:40.421 --> 16:41.532
Thank you.

16:41.556 --> 16:43.267
My own blend.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.690
A family tradition.

16:48.029 --> 16:49.740
You are a woman.

16:49.764 --> 16:50.974
You're a genius.

16:50.998 --> 16:53.364
I have no problem with women.

16:55.970 --> 16:57.699
But I cannot vouch for my men.

16:59.574 --> 17:01.652
I'm not paying you
to assure my safety.

17:01.676 --> 17:04.087
What are you paying me for?

17:04.111 --> 17:05.388
Passage.

17:05.413 --> 17:07.074
And discretion.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.993
The second I can guarantee.

17:11.018 --> 17:12.815
As for the first...

17:13.854 --> 17:15.219
To Somalia.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.270
You have been misinformed.

17:20.294 --> 17:22.172
The Damocles
is headed for Masqat.

17:22.195 --> 17:23.440
That is not true.

17:23.464 --> 17:24.761
You lie.

17:28.135 --> 17:30.681
To protect his crew, of course.

17:30.705 --> 17:32.182
Shalev, my friend,

17:32.206 --> 17:34.751
what offense have I done that
you would send me such people?

17:34.775 --> 17:36.987
Their money is good.

17:37.011 --> 17:39.036
All money is good.

17:45.386 --> 17:47.231
Welcome aboard.

17:47.255 --> 17:48.745
We leave tonight.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.577
The crew is sitting down to eat.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.045
Ziva, you are coming?

18:02.069 --> 18:03.934
Not hungry.

18:05.706 --> 18:06.883
Aviv, you go ahead.

18:06.907 --> 18:08.841
- We're right behind you.
- Okay.

18:11.412 --> 18:13.557
We do not need
to make friends with the crew.

18:13.581 --> 18:14.825
We need their trust.

18:14.849 --> 18:17.427
And breaking bread
will ease their nerves?

18:17.451 --> 18:20.063
At the moment, it is not
their nerves which concern me.

18:20.087 --> 18:21.932
Have you ever seen
a snake shed its skin

18:21.956 --> 18:23.934
and then try to crawl
back into it?

18:23.958 --> 18:26.169
It is not natural.

18:26.193 --> 18:27.904
You don't need your old skin.

18:27.928 --> 18:29.906
It is who you are inside.

18:29.930 --> 18:31.308
Just relax.

18:31.332 --> 18:33.061
Let it grow back.

18:34.468 --> 18:36.980
The Americans left you, Ziva.

18:37.004 --> 18:39.495
Your family never has.

19:22.850 --> 19:24.750
What are you looking for?

19:26.053 --> 19:27.798
Hey, all right,
all right, all right.

19:27.822 --> 19:29.366
I just thought
this was the head.

19:29.390 --> 19:31.501
Tell the truth.

19:31.525 --> 19:33.103
Or I shoot you.

19:33.127 --> 19:34.604
In the head.

19:34.628 --> 19:36.006
I made a mistake.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.507
It was just a mistake.

19:37.531 --> 19:39.543
I cannot help but question.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.378
You say you are going
to Somalia?

19:41.402 --> 19:43.347
Why?

19:43.371 --> 19:44.781
I don't know.

19:44.805 --> 19:46.183
No one goes to Somalia

19:46.207 --> 19:47.751
without a reason.

19:47.775 --> 19:49.953
Very few go with a reason.

19:49.977 --> 19:51.355
He tells the truth.

19:51.379 --> 19:52.622
He does not know.

19:52.646 --> 19:53.990
He just works for me.

19:54.014 --> 19:56.259
He opens doors
he should not be opening.

19:56.283 --> 19:57.694
I feel I should shoot him!

19:57.718 --> 19:59.763
I would rather you did not.

19:59.787 --> 20:03.400
I asked him to find us
some... privacy.

20:03.424 --> 20:05.483
Oh.

20:06.694 --> 20:08.972
He works for you.

20:08.996 --> 20:10.759
Yes.

20:14.101 --> 20:15.864
Good night.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.084
I didn't mean to...

20:21.108 --> 20:22.386
Not another word.

20:22.410 --> 20:23.754
You should not be
snooping around.

20:23.778 --> 20:26.056
Yeah, well,
that's how I make my living.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.258
Not if you do anything
to jeopardize this mission.

20:28.282 --> 20:30.944
I will kill you myself.

20:32.486 --> 20:35.065
And the man you saved
that night, who was he?

20:35.089 --> 20:38.502
He was a private contractor
we hired to put us on the ship.

20:38.526 --> 20:41.405
He said his name
was Daniel Shalev.

20:41.429 --> 20:43.039
But you know otherwise.

20:43.063 --> 20:45.642
That was the name
he used in Jordan.

20:45.666 --> 20:49.246
He went by Daniel Cryer
when he was a U.S. marine.

20:49.270 --> 20:50.814
Did you know he was a marine?

20:50.838 --> 20:55.385
In a ship filled
with smugglers and thieves,

20:55.409 --> 20:57.554
he did not fit in.

20:57.578 --> 20:59.205
So you trusted him?

21:00.714 --> 21:02.526
Do you know the word
"mishpacha"?

21:02.550 --> 21:04.361
It's "family."

21:04.385 --> 21:07.564
He was not.

21:07.588 --> 21:12.082
You cannot trust a man
whose loyalty has a price.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.594
Hmm. Nice bedside manner.

21:23.604 --> 21:25.682
You're lucky you're not dead.

21:25.706 --> 21:27.617
That's true for anyone.

21:27.641 --> 21:30.120
The others are up at the,
uh, breakfast buffet.

21:30.144 --> 21:32.355
Malachi wanted to let
you get some rest.

21:32.379 --> 21:35.815
Past couple of weeks
have been trying.

21:37.084 --> 21:39.348
Who are you exactly, Mr. Shalev?

21:44.358 --> 21:46.670
Your Hebrew name does not fit.

21:46.694 --> 21:48.672
Well, I was just bar mitzvahed.

21:48.696 --> 21:50.674
Late-life awakening?

21:50.698 --> 21:52.542
Not too late.

21:52.566 --> 21:54.244
I'm 31 years old.

21:54.268 --> 21:56.913
And adept at dodging questions.

21:56.937 --> 21:58.148
"Who am I?"

21:58.172 --> 22:02.185
Anybody really like answering
that question?

22:02.209 --> 22:04.955
How do you define yourself?

22:04.979 --> 22:06.970
You are...

22:08.015 --> 22:10.727
what you say.

22:10.751 --> 22:13.413
You are what you eat.

22:14.421 --> 22:16.582
You are what you do.

22:18.592 --> 22:21.671
You are reckless.

22:21.695 --> 22:23.406
Hmm.

22:23.430 --> 22:27.577
You mean last night
with that psycho Numas?

22:27.601 --> 22:30.046
I've talked my way
out of worse situations.

22:30.070 --> 22:32.538
I'm sure you have.

22:38.679 --> 22:40.624
If you don't want
to give yourself away,

22:40.648 --> 22:42.058
lose the jewelry.

22:42.082 --> 22:45.449
I would sooner die
than take this necklace off.

22:49.056 --> 22:51.286
You ought to know.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.311
Get it.

23:01.335 --> 23:03.079
You get it;
You're the senior field agent.

23:03.103 --> 23:04.180
So it's my responsibility

23:04.204 --> 23:05.282
to answer Gibbs' phone
in his absence?

23:05.306 --> 23:06.283
Yeah.

23:06.307 --> 23:07.784
Then you have to get it.

23:07.808 --> 23:09.653
- Uh, how do you figure that?
- Because you're supposed

23:09.677 --> 23:12.046
to do all my work
because of the bet.

23:16.517 --> 23:18.428
This is Special Agent McGee.

23:18.452 --> 23:19.863
We have
Mossad Officer Ben-Gidon.

23:19.887 --> 23:20.897
Okay, I'll escort him up.

23:20.921 --> 23:21.898
Escort who?

23:21.922 --> 23:23.822
Someone named Ben-Gidon.

23:24.892 --> 23:27.190
Get him. I'll get Gibbs.

23:28.762 --> 23:30.907
The ship was supposed
to resupply Saleem.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.109
You greased Cryer's palm
to book passage.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.045
You're making him sound
like something he was not.

23:35.069 --> 23:36.513
He cashed out of the Corps.

23:36.537 --> 23:37.614
Look,

23:37.638 --> 23:41.318
I have learned
many things from Gibbs.

23:41.342 --> 23:42.886
One of the first lessons...

23:42.910 --> 23:45.355
there is no such thing
as an ex-marine.

23:45.379 --> 23:48.692
Regardless
of who Cryer had become.

23:48.716 --> 23:50.741
Boss, we got a problem.

23:54.622 --> 23:57.934
What can we do for you,
Officer Ben-Gidon?

23:57.958 --> 23:59.569
I've come for Ziva David.

23:59.593 --> 24:01.838
You're holding a member
of my team hostage in there.

24:01.862 --> 24:03.473
Your team's had a rough year.

24:03.497 --> 24:06.810
I think you already missed
your chance to rescue Ziva.

24:06.834 --> 24:10.099
Then I hope I've arrived
in time to rescue her from you.

24:19.112 --> 24:21.090
- Hostage?
- Yeah.

24:21.114 --> 24:24.527
That's the word
of Officer Malachi Ben-Gidon.

24:24.551 --> 24:25.929
I'm keeping Ziva hostage?

24:25.953 --> 24:27.730
Leon, she's got
no connection to NCIS.

24:27.754 --> 24:30.066
Except we pulled her out
of the desert and they didn't.

24:30.090 --> 24:32.769
- Why didn't they?
- We found her first.

24:32.793 --> 24:34.537
Eli didn't send his cleaner.

24:34.561 --> 24:36.372
He sent the Kidon team leader.

24:36.396 --> 24:38.041
Ziva's commanding officer.

24:38.065 --> 24:40.877
He says if we force Ziva to talk
about Mossad operations,

24:40.901 --> 24:42.545
she'll be in violation
of Israeli law.

24:42.569 --> 24:44.180
She's not at liberty
to speak to us.

24:44.204 --> 24:46.015
No, he doesn't want her to talk.

24:46.039 --> 24:47.183
He's got to put something
on the table.

24:47.207 --> 24:49.552
Why don't we see
how much rope he's got?

24:49.576 --> 24:51.976
Probably just enough
to hang himself.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.739
There's coasters in the cabinet.

24:56.783 --> 24:58.862
Ice water.

24:58.886 --> 24:59.896
Uh-huh.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.132
I keep the top shelf
on the bottom.

25:03.156 --> 25:07.115
Everything is upside-down.

25:08.161 --> 25:10.106
Ho-ho.

25:10.130 --> 25:11.975
You should have told me
you were coming, Mal.

25:11.999 --> 25:13.343
I would have picked you up
at the airport,

25:13.367 --> 25:14.601
returned the favor.

25:15.602 --> 25:17.413
Good to see you.

25:17.437 --> 25:19.315
So... I am

25:19.339 --> 25:22.485
really sorry that we haven't
stayed in touch since Israel.

25:22.509 --> 25:23.920
Not even so much as an e-card.

25:23.944 --> 25:27.323
Modern times...
everyone's so busy.

25:27.347 --> 25:28.625
Hey, I hope we're showing you

25:28.649 --> 25:30.727
the same hospitality
you guys showed me.

25:30.751 --> 25:32.729
I had a blast in Israel.

25:32.753 --> 25:34.163
Anyone offer you tea or coffee?

25:34.187 --> 25:35.331
We're out of gefilte fish.

25:35.355 --> 25:38.401
Do you truly enjoy
jellied balls of carp,

25:38.425 --> 25:41.094
or are you merely being
anti-Semitic?

25:42.429 --> 25:43.973
Hold on one second. Yeah, boss.

25:43.997 --> 25:44.974
DiNozzo,

25:44.998 --> 25:46.676
- bring our guest downstairs.
- Mm-hmm.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.911
- Now.
- Okay.

25:47.935 --> 25:49.679
Will do.

25:49.703 --> 25:52.749
Manners... where are mine?

25:52.773 --> 25:54.764
Let me take you to Ziva.

25:59.379 --> 26:01.357
Where is she?

26:01.381 --> 26:04.327
You worried we buried her
in a deep, dark hole some place,

26:04.351 --> 26:05.929
left her to rot?

26:05.953 --> 26:07.430
That's not our style.

26:07.454 --> 26:09.032
You've had adequate time
for debriefing.

26:09.056 --> 26:12.001
Cease your interrogation
and return her immediately.

26:12.025 --> 26:14.137
The thanks of a grateful nation.

26:14.161 --> 26:15.772
These are
Director David's instructions.

26:15.796 --> 26:17.106
You're just the messenger.

26:17.130 --> 26:19.208
I respect
Director David's intentions,

26:19.232 --> 26:21.377
but I got a dead marine
downstairs.

26:21.401 --> 26:23.546
I can't release her

26:23.570 --> 26:26.130
until I find out
what happened on that ship.

26:29.242 --> 26:31.506
I was there, too.

26:33.480 --> 26:38.281
I tell you what happened,
and Ziva goes free.

26:49.863 --> 26:51.641
Who are they cheering for?

26:51.665 --> 26:53.977
The favorite. They're fickle.

26:54.001 --> 26:55.712
We make landfall in two days.

26:55.736 --> 26:57.880
That's the schedule.

26:57.904 --> 27:00.236
There have been no changes?

27:04.077 --> 27:06.756
I have Aviv monitoring
all on board transmissions.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.858
Too far at sea
for radio to land.

27:08.882 --> 27:10.526
Satellite phones.

27:10.550 --> 27:13.246
You do not trust the captain?

27:15.255 --> 27:17.200
I do not trust anyone.

27:17.224 --> 27:19.369
Yosef has been in contact
with Saleem's courier.

27:19.393 --> 27:21.170
To alert him of their arrival.

27:21.194 --> 27:22.205
You think he suspects us?

27:22.229 --> 27:23.873
I think there is too much talk.

27:23.897 --> 27:25.108
We need silence.

27:25.132 --> 27:28.211
You are contemplating
a change to the plan.

27:28.235 --> 27:30.613
Tomorrow the ship will be
in range of the coast.

27:30.637 --> 27:32.448
We cannot do anything
until then.

27:32.472 --> 27:35.251
Ziva...

27:35.275 --> 27:38.039
your father says
any means necessary.

28:15.048 --> 28:16.526
Ugh, I haven't seen

28:16.550 --> 28:18.294
this many soggy electronics
since Wet Monday

28:18.318 --> 28:19.862
at science camp.

28:19.886 --> 28:21.130
We used to build water guns,

28:21.154 --> 28:23.666
water cannons,
water balloon launchers.

28:23.690 --> 28:26.069
Actually, it's a terrible idea,
in retrospect.

28:26.093 --> 28:27.303
Forensic triage.

28:27.327 --> 28:29.505
These phones and radios
are going to need repair.

28:29.529 --> 28:32.809
All these weapons are
a ballistics nightmare.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.744
We're going to need a plan
of attack here, Abbs.

28:34.768 --> 28:36.446
That would violate
my philosophy.

28:36.470 --> 28:37.780
You have a philosophy?

28:37.804 --> 28:39.282
I have many philosophies,

28:39.306 --> 28:40.783
but I'm talking
about one that's relevant

28:40.807 --> 28:43.019
to now, when dealing
with large amounts of evidence.

28:43.043 --> 28:44.987
- Which is?
- No plan... just go.

28:45.011 --> 28:46.289
Find along the way.

28:46.313 --> 28:47.523
If you look
for something specific...

28:47.547 --> 28:49.981
Then there's only
one right answer.

28:50.817 --> 28:51.928
High five, McGee.

28:51.952 --> 28:53.529
Okay.

28:53.553 --> 28:55.565
- What was that for?
- Positive energy.

28:55.589 --> 28:58.835
The collision of two life forces
in solidarity.

28:58.859 --> 29:01.471
The reverberations will be felt
by the rest of Team Ziva,

29:01.495 --> 29:03.005
wherever they may be hiding.

29:03.029 --> 29:04.240
Gibbs isn't hiding.

29:04.264 --> 29:07.243
Gibbs isn't acting
like he's on Team Ziva.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.112
One more.

29:09.136 --> 29:10.569
Come on, for Ziva.

29:20.113 --> 29:21.457
Ah, Ziva.

29:21.481 --> 29:24.026
Uh, I am in need
of clarification

29:24.050 --> 29:25.261
that perhaps you could provide.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.462
Anthony, if you wouldn't mind...

29:26.486 --> 29:27.697
Believe me, Ducky,
I wouldn't mind.

29:27.721 --> 29:28.764
Oh, Director Vance
will not permit me

29:28.788 --> 29:29.999
to be without an escort.

29:30.023 --> 29:34.170
Ah, well, uh, in that case...
after you,

29:34.194 --> 29:35.786
my dear.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.531
Wait, Ducky.

29:43.904 --> 29:48.341
Complex situations often call
for creative solutions.

29:50.877 --> 29:52.555
The crew of the Damocles,

29:52.579 --> 29:55.980
removed
from their watery graves.

29:57.751 --> 29:59.719
Sit down.

30:00.954 --> 30:05.635
I do not know what games
they are playing upstairs,

30:05.659 --> 30:07.889
but I have had enough.

30:09.596 --> 30:13.709
First and foremost,
you are our friend.

30:13.733 --> 30:16.065
I want to be a friend, Ziva.

30:18.738 --> 30:23.319
Bahir Numas, Quadir Nawaf,

30:23.343 --> 30:27.190
Kassib Yosef, Emir Aza Bilal...

30:27.214 --> 30:29.325
I do not need
to know their names.

30:29.349 --> 30:33.729
And yet you carry the weight
of their deaths around with you,

30:33.753 --> 30:36.098
and there's no need to.

30:36.122 --> 30:40.388
Trust us, as we trust you.

30:41.394 --> 30:43.760
Let them go.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.578
There is only one name.

30:48.602 --> 30:51.047
Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer.

30:51.071 --> 30:53.562
Yeah, that's him there.

30:57.277 --> 30:59.021
I knew him as Daniel Shalev.

30:59.045 --> 31:02.378
The truth, Ziva,
may set you free.

31:03.416 --> 31:05.394
And it may not.

31:05.418 --> 31:07.930
Ziva...

31:07.954 --> 31:10.787
some bodies are not meant
to stay buried.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.172
What happened to him?

31:16.196 --> 31:18.641
Cabin fever.

31:18.665 --> 31:20.610
Paranoia.

31:20.634 --> 31:23.946
Or maybe we just
underestimated them.

31:23.970 --> 31:25.648
As it turns out,
we were not the only ones

31:25.672 --> 31:27.316
monitoring outgoing
transmissions.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.551
You cannot be certain

31:28.575 --> 31:29.986
that Shalev has told
the crew anything.

31:30.010 --> 31:31.520
I will not take that chance.

31:31.544 --> 31:32.755
We may have already
been delivered

31:32.779 --> 31:33.789
like rats to the trap.

31:33.813 --> 31:35.213
If we have been
compromised, Ziva...

31:37.784 --> 31:39.853
Aviv!

31:55.502 --> 31:57.546
Our contingency plan...

31:57.570 --> 32:00.440
Was to take everyone.

32:22.696 --> 32:24.707
Idiot, hold your fire.

32:24.731 --> 32:26.509
Numas, I thought you were them.

32:26.533 --> 32:28.899
Who, the Mossad
that you let on board?

32:51.157 --> 32:52.749
You should keep
your distance, Ducky.

32:54.861 --> 32:56.839
The ones who get too close

32:56.863 --> 32:58.854
always end up dead.

33:06.272 --> 33:08.617
She knew that Cryer
was a marine.

33:08.641 --> 33:10.986
Doesn't matter if he changed
his name and become a mercenary.

33:11.010 --> 33:12.755
That's it, she's done here.

33:12.779 --> 33:14.023
If it's true.

33:14.047 --> 33:17.059
You want to give her
a chance to deny it?

33:17.083 --> 33:18.494
She can't even speak
on the subject.

33:18.518 --> 33:19.528
On the record.

33:19.552 --> 33:21.163
Malachi's more than willing.

33:21.187 --> 33:23.132
All right.

33:23.156 --> 33:24.166
Pass the baton.

33:24.190 --> 33:25.668
You ready to play bad cop?

33:25.692 --> 33:29.093
You've been playing good cop
all this time, Leon?

33:30.563 --> 33:32.326
Put 'em together.

33:39.372 --> 33:40.749
Say nothing, Ziva.

33:40.773 --> 33:41.784
I am handling this.

33:41.808 --> 33:44.276
I have nothing to say to you.

33:50.683 --> 33:52.094
Just dropped Ziva
in the lion's den.

33:52.118 --> 33:53.362
Any second that door's
going to open

33:53.386 --> 33:55.030
and Gibbs is going to ask
us what do we got.

33:55.054 --> 33:56.065
So what do we got?

33:56.089 --> 33:58.200
Abby and I are drowning
in ballistics.

33:58.224 --> 34:00.836
We have no time
to process everything,

34:00.860 --> 34:02.471
though we were able
to nail the location

34:02.495 --> 34:04.006
of the final battle
and I.D. the players.

34:04.030 --> 34:06.175
That's good, since Malachi
told us exactly that.

34:06.199 --> 34:07.876
Well, we can confirm it.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.878
Including the part where he says
Ziva killed a marine?

34:09.902 --> 34:11.301
We need something else.

34:12.271 --> 34:13.815
Ducky's got something.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.551
- Ducky's got a folder.
- Yes, and a growing

34:15.574 --> 34:18.187
sensation in the bursa sac
of my left knee.

34:18.210 --> 34:20.856
Hence the elevator
rather than the stairs,

34:20.880 --> 34:23.025
- which would be...
- Ducky. Folder.

34:23.049 --> 34:25.694
Oh, yes. Well, all I have
is cause of death forms.

34:25.717 --> 34:28.263
Multiple bodies with
nine-millimeter gunshot wounds.

34:28.286 --> 34:32.400
An abundance with 5.7 by 28
in the chest and abdomen.

34:32.425 --> 34:35.371
A single large-caliber
gunshot wound to the head.

34:35.395 --> 34:36.371
That's Cryer.

34:36.396 --> 34:38.007
You found the slug?

34:38.031 --> 34:39.842
We've got smashed
.45 titanium-tipped

34:39.866 --> 34:41.310
hollow-point slugs
that were recovered

34:41.333 --> 34:42.344
from the maintenance bay.

34:42.368 --> 34:44.013
And the one that killed Cryer?

34:44.036 --> 34:45.214
I hate these words.

34:45.237 --> 34:46.248
Lost at sea.

34:46.272 --> 34:47.916
How many.45 slugs do we have?

34:47.940 --> 34:49.737
Three.

34:51.110 --> 34:52.521
But they're all smushed.

34:52.545 --> 34:55.524
Abby, any organic matter
on those three slugs?

34:55.547 --> 34:56.525
Residue of human tissue

34:56.549 --> 34:58.427
- or blood?
- Negative.

34:58.451 --> 35:00.043
I got that far.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.598
Then they were misses.

35:02.622 --> 35:03.766
Total misses.

35:03.790 --> 35:04.967
At close range.

35:04.991 --> 35:06.769
Doesn't sound
like the Ziva I know.

35:06.793 --> 35:08.737
Does it sound like Ben-Gidon?

35:08.761 --> 35:11.740
Not unless something threw
his shot off.

35:11.764 --> 35:14.232
How quick can you get me
an unsmushed.45 slug?

35:17.737 --> 35:19.728
- Hey, boss.
- What have you got?

35:24.377 --> 35:25.688
We're going to leave now.

35:25.712 --> 35:27.022
Half right. You're half wrong.

35:27.046 --> 35:28.090
My patience is at...

35:28.114 --> 35:30.359
Sit down, shut up.

35:30.383 --> 35:31.894
There something wrong
with your shoulder?

35:31.918 --> 35:33.619
Broken clavicle.

35:35.088 --> 35:37.454
Slow to heal.

35:41.127 --> 35:42.560
You, too. Sit down.

35:47.967 --> 35:50.435
He says that you killed Cryer.

35:51.838 --> 35:54.149
- Of course she is gonna deny it.
- Shut up!

35:54.173 --> 35:56.437
Both of you are done telling
stories. It's my turn.

36:00.613 --> 36:02.124
Put it down.

36:02.148 --> 36:03.959
You put it down.

36:03.983 --> 36:05.994
I do not want to kill you.

36:06.018 --> 36:07.129
Oh, that's good.

36:07.153 --> 36:08.586
'Cause I do not want to die.

36:09.622 --> 36:12.601
Did you betray us?

36:12.625 --> 36:15.204
If I had,

36:15.228 --> 36:17.897
what would stop me from pulling
the trigger right now?

36:35.782 --> 36:36.925
This is your story?

36:36.949 --> 36:37.960
No, it's the truth.

36:37.984 --> 36:39.661
Those are your misses
on the wall.

36:39.685 --> 36:42.030
Gives you the smoking gun.

36:42.054 --> 36:43.832
This is the kill shot.

36:43.856 --> 36:46.882
The slug you put in United
States Marine Daniel Cryer.

36:52.932 --> 36:55.744
This the way your boss operates?

36:55.768 --> 36:58.247
Sends you to try to burn her?

36:58.271 --> 36:59.414
She's on my team.

36:59.438 --> 37:01.770
Didn't say you were happy
about it.

37:03.810 --> 37:06.622
Are you...

37:06.646 --> 37:08.637
following orders?

37:14.387 --> 37:17.633
Your father, Ziva.

37:17.657 --> 37:19.668
He's not a good guy.

37:19.692 --> 37:22.252
He's dirty.

37:25.097 --> 37:27.156
You could not say no to him.

37:29.101 --> 37:31.613
Not a second time.

37:31.637 --> 37:32.815
Go.

37:32.839 --> 37:34.740
Get out of here, run!

37:37.777 --> 37:39.555
You tell Eli David to stay away.

37:39.579 --> 37:40.910
She is off-limits.

37:43.382 --> 37:45.994
I failed you, Ziva.

37:46.018 --> 37:48.030
I'm sorry.

37:48.054 --> 37:50.199
Never apologize.

37:50.223 --> 37:53.215
It is a sign of weakness.

38:05.605 --> 38:07.273
Shut it down.

38:21.220 --> 38:22.798
We're not done.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.833
Finish it.

38:24.857 --> 38:28.170
You know everything
that happened.

38:28.194 --> 38:29.838
After the ship.

38:29.862 --> 38:31.506
After you scuttled it.

38:31.530 --> 38:33.327
Made it to land.

38:34.367 --> 38:36.358
We had a mission.

38:37.904 --> 38:39.915
He wanted it done.

38:39.939 --> 38:41.873
Your father.

38:42.909 --> 38:45.810
At any cost.

38:50.917 --> 38:54.785
Don't bury it, Ziva.

39:02.028 --> 39:03.863
Understood, Director.

39:04.997 --> 39:06.862
What did my father say?

39:07.867 --> 39:09.845
To proceed.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.981
We are to follow the courier
to Saleem and kill him.

39:13.005 --> 39:16.372
Did you tell him Aviv is dead
and you two are wounded?

39:18.678 --> 39:21.690
He thinks this is
the best chance we have.

39:21.714 --> 39:23.358
Then we have nothing.

39:23.382 --> 39:24.693
Who was Shalev calling?

39:24.717 --> 39:26.929
It doesn't matter.

39:26.953 --> 39:29.765
He was a leak that needed
to be plugged.

39:29.789 --> 39:31.433
No one could know
we were coming.

39:31.457 --> 39:32.567
And no one does.

39:32.591 --> 39:34.970
I will go alone.

39:34.994 --> 39:36.204
Forget it.

39:36.228 --> 39:37.873
Look, we cannot disobey
a direct order.

39:37.897 --> 39:40.933
- Ziva, it is suicide.
- It is what it is!

39:45.538 --> 39:47.529
Good-bye.

40:01.187 --> 40:04.533
It was...

40:04.557 --> 40:07.549
my choice.

40:10.229 --> 40:12.207
I killed the courier...

40:12.231 --> 40:15.210
and his gunman...

40:15.234 --> 40:18.347
after I forced them to take me
to Saleem's camp.

40:18.371 --> 40:21.350
I fought my way
through his defenses.

40:21.374 --> 40:24.486
I got within a fingernail

40:24.510 --> 40:27.502
of Saleem before I was...

40:29.115 --> 40:32.107
overpowered.

40:37.456 --> 40:40.602
I had nothing but death
in my heart.

40:40.626 --> 40:43.205
You never had a choice.

40:43.229 --> 40:45.220
He didn't give you a choice.

40:46.265 --> 40:49.044
He raised you to be a ruthless,

40:49.068 --> 40:52.526
soulless... killer.

40:54.573 --> 40:57.052
I did not mean
to live through it.

40:57.076 --> 40:59.054
You didn't.

40:59.078 --> 41:01.273
That part of you died out there.

41:04.116 --> 41:08.416
I am... sorry... Gibbs.

41:32.645 --> 41:34.589
I'm not happy
about it either, Eli.

41:34.613 --> 41:35.624
Self-serving, manipulative...

41:35.648 --> 41:36.925
Gibbs is an awful
son of a bitch.

41:36.949 --> 41:38.660
Y-You might think
he's a thorn in your side.

41:38.684 --> 41:40.295
He's a pain in my ass.

41:40.319 --> 41:42.164
He is a thief,
stealing my daughter.

41:42.188 --> 41:44.433
I know, I know you're upset,
I know she's your daughter.

41:44.457 --> 41:46.368
- My flesh and blood...
- I will continue to deal with it,

41:46.392 --> 41:49.204
but you have to...
you have to believe

41:49.228 --> 41:51.206
- I am your ally here.
- Then show me.

41:51.230 --> 41:53.041
I will deal with Gibbs,

41:53.065 --> 41:54.876
but she has chosen
to deal with him, too.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.311
We'll let the issue rest
for the moment.

41:56.335 --> 41:57.813
This is not
the last conversation

41:57.837 --> 41:59.597
- we will have on the subject.
- Shalom, Eli.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.253
Not bad.

42:05.277 --> 42:07.580
Not bad at all.

42:14.820 --> 42:16.117
Hmm.

42:17.189 --> 42:18.166
Hey.

42:18.190 --> 42:20.469
How'd you come up with the idea
to bluff the slug so quickly?

42:20.493 --> 42:22.037
That's how I think... quickly.

42:22.061 --> 42:23.038
No.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.206
You already had the idea.

42:24.230 --> 42:27.008
You created the virus
on my computer.

42:27.032 --> 42:29.511
So you can accept the fact
that I can create a virus

42:29.535 --> 42:31.580
but not that I can
get rid of one,

42:31.604 --> 42:32.681
and that makes sense to you.

42:32.705 --> 42:33.682
You brought in a ringer.

42:33.706 --> 42:35.283
Well, that's interesting.

42:35.307 --> 42:37.285
That would've been one way
for me to win the bet.

42:37.309 --> 42:38.954
Now, do my work.

42:38.978 --> 42:40.222
You didn't win the bet.

42:40.246 --> 42:42.757
The bet was who could
remove the virus faster.

42:42.781 --> 42:44.793
You or I, not a third person.

42:44.817 --> 42:46.628
You violated the terms
of the wager.

42:46.652 --> 42:49.197
Therefore, I win
and you do my work.

42:49.221 --> 42:50.899
I'm not doing it.

42:50.923 --> 42:52.891
Well, I'm not doing it either.

42:57.730 --> 42:59.561
Get to work...

43:01.100 --> 43:03.034
probie.
