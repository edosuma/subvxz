02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:33.526
of the unredacted documents

02:00:33.643 --> 02:00:35.316
published on
the WikiLeaks website.

02:00:35.395 --> 02:00:38.023
Not one shred of evidence.

02:00:38.690 --> 02:00:42.661
We're taking on large,
powerful groups...

02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:45.114
with vast and powerful lobbies
to protect them.

02:00:45.196 --> 02:00:46.618
So, of course,
we're going to be attacked

02:00:46.698 --> 02:00:48.041
in all sorts of manners.

02:00:57.834 --> 02:00:59.177
My goodness.

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:02.218
Well, I know the mainstream
media is biased...

02:01:02.338 --> 02:01:04.340
but this is absurd.

02:01:04.424 --> 02:01:08.054
These allegations
are without basis...

02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:11.264
and their issue
is deeply disturbing.

02:01:19.355 --> 02:01:20.948
As an organization, of course

02:01:21.024 --> 02:01:24.369
of course we, uh,
have made mistakes.

02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:25.786
Um...

02:01:26.905 --> 02:01:29.454
Uh... There are perhaps
a number of individuals...

02:01:29.532 --> 02:01:31.876
An individual, perhaps,

02:01:32.285 --> 02:01:34.788
that we should not
have employed.

02:01:35.872 --> 02:01:36.964
Um...

02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:41.295
That is possibly
the greatest mistake.

02:01:49.928 --> 02:01:51.555
A WikiLeaks movie?

02:01:52.722 --> 02:01:54.099
Which one?

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.318
Oh, that one. Mmm.

02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:01.360
Well, that one is based on
the two worst books...

02:02:01.439 --> 02:02:04.909
full of lies and distortion,
like all bad propaganda.

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:07.328
Look, urn...
A WikiLeaks movie...

02:02:07.403 --> 02:02:09.997
It's more like
the "anti-WikiLeaks" movie.

02:02:11.407 --> 02:02:14.331
If you want to know
the truth...

02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:16.997
no one is going
to tell you the truth.

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.503
They're only going
to tell you their version.

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:22.135
So, if you want the truth...

02:02:22.919 --> 02:02:24.887
you have to seek it out
for yourself.

02:02:24.963 --> 02:02:28.763
In fact, that's where
the real power lies...

02:02:28.842 --> 02:02:33.598
in your willingness
to look beyond this story...

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.273
any story.

02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.642
And as long
as you keep searching,

02:02:37.767 --> 02:02:39.986
you are dangerous to them.

02:02:41.479 --> 02:02:43.982
That's what
they're afraid of. You.

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:46.822
It's all about you.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.281
(CHUCKLES)

02:02:51.865 --> 02:02:54.163
And a little bit about me, too.

02:02:58.913 --> 02:03:00.836
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
