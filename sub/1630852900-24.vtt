WEBVTT

00:37.871 --> 00:39.205
WELCOME, I'M JOHN

00:39.272 --> 00:40.206
OLIVER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:40.273 --> 00:40.707
JOINING US IT HAS BEEN

00:40.774 --> 00:41.341
HURRICANE IAN BATTERED FLORIDA,

00:41.408 --> 00:42.909
A BUSY WEEK.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.344
MASSIVE PROTESTS CONTINUED IN

00:44.411 --> 00:45.178
IRAN, AND A FAR-RIGHT COALITION

00:45.245 --> 00:48.715
TOOK POWER IN ITALY.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.184
AND THE ONLY GOOD NEWS THERE IS

00:51.251 --> 00:51.885
THAT DOING AN OVER-THE-TOP

00:51.951 --> 00:52.652
ITALIAN ACCENT IS NOW.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.053
A NOBLE STRIKE AGAINST THE RISE

00:54.120 --> 00:56.122
OF FASCISM.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.023
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START IN THE

00:57.090 --> 00:57.824
UK, WHERE BRAND-NEW PRIME

00:57.891 --> 00:58.825
MINISTER LIZ TRUSS HAS BEEN

00:58.892 --> 01:00.126
FACING A COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS

01:00.193 --> 01:02.662
DUE TO HIGH ENERGY PRICES.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.897
SHE UNVEILED A NEW ECONOMIC PLAN

01:03.963 --> 01:05.932
LAST FRIDAY, ACCOMPANIED, FOR

01:05.999 --> 01:06.966
SOME REASON, BY A VIDEO WHERE

01:07.033 --> 01:08.435
STIRRING MUSIC ALMOST MANAGED TO

01:08.501 --> 01:10.036
DISGUISE AN UTTER LACK OF

01:10.103 --> 01:11.771
CONTENT.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.741
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT

01:14.808 --> 01:16.810
MAKING SURE THAT THE UNITED

01:16.876 --> 01:18.511
KINGDOM IS A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY

01:18.578 --> 01:19.979
WHERE WE'RE GETTING MORE JOBS,

01:20.046 --> 01:23.149
MORE INVESTMENT.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.684
THIS IS A FANTASTIC COUNTRY WITH

01:24.751 --> 01:27.086
HUGE RESERVES OF TALENT, ENERGY,

01:27.153 --> 01:28.888
AND ENTERPRISE.

01:28.955 --> 01:30.857
AND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IS

01:30.924 --> 01:35.662
UNLEASHING THOSE TALENTS, THAT

01:35.728 --> 01:36.963
ENERGY, FOR THE BETTERMENT OF

01:37.030 --> 01:39.332
OUR COUNTRY.

01:39.399 --> 01:44.270
FIRST, CHOOSE A CAMERA.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.505
YOU'VE GOT TWO THERE, AND YOU'RE

01:45.572 --> 01:46.439
LOOKING AT NEITHER OF THEM.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.774
SECOND, THAT MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE

01:47.841 --> 01:49.409
IT'S FROM "GENERICALLY INSPIRING

01:49.476 --> 01:50.109
VIOLIN FOR BULLSHIT POLITICAL

01:50.176 --> 01:50.710
ADS AND COMMERCIALS FOR

01:50.777 --> 01:56.316
HOSPITALS, VOL.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.283
HOSPITALS, VOL 2."

01:57.350 --> 01:58.518
AND FINALLY, "UNLEASHING TALENT

01:58.585 --> 01:59.285
AND ENERGY" IS COMPLETELY

01:59.352 --> 01:59.986
MEANINGLESS, UNLESS YOU'RE A

02:00.053 --> 02:01.087
YOUTH TRACK COACH THAT'S FINALLY

02:01.154 --> 02:02.021
DECIDED TO GIVE THE TEAM

02:02.088 --> 02:03.323
STEROIDS.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.757
TRUSS' PLAN, CONTROVERSIALLY,

02:04.824 --> 02:06.359
ENTAILS MASSIVE TAX CUTS, MOSTLY

02:06.426 --> 02:08.161
TO THE WEALTHY, ON THE

02:08.228 --> 02:09.329
ASSUMPTION IT'LL EVENTUALLY

02:09.395 --> 02:10.497
BOOST THE ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE.

02:10.563 --> 02:12.232
IT'S BASICALLY TRICKLE-DOWN

02:12.298 --> 02:14.100
ECONOMICS BULLSHIT YET AGAIN,

02:14.167 --> 02:15.368
AND IT'S SOMETHING TRUSS' ALLIES

02:15.435 --> 02:17.136
TRIED TO JUSTIFY, WITH ONE

02:17.203 --> 02:18.571
ARGUING THAT "A RISING TIDE

02:18.638 --> 02:20.440
LIFTS ALL SHIPS", AND SAYING

02:21.875 --> 02:22.942
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPOSALS,

02:23.009 --> 02:23.943
ACCORDING TO THE RESOLUTION

02:24.010 --> 02:25.612
FOUNDATION, IF YOU'RE 1,000,000

02:25.678 --> 02:26.579
POUNDS, YOU'RE GETTING A TAX CUT

02:26.646 --> 02:27.881
OF 55,000 POUNDS.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.649
I MEAN, THAT IS QUITE CLEARLY

02:29.716 --> 02:30.316
TAX CUTS THAT ARE WEIGHTED AT

02:30.383 --> 02:34.153
THE TOP END OF THE SCALE.

02:34.220 --> 02:34.854
YEAH.

02:34.921 --> 02:35.688
SO IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS THE

02:35.755 --> 02:36.556
DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS OF THE

02:36.623 --> 02:37.824
TAX CUTS IN THE NEXT 24 WEEKS,

02:37.891 --> 02:39.125
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS

02:39.192 --> 02:40.727
PACKAGE IF YOU CARE MORE ABOUT

02:40.793 --> 02:41.828
THE POOR.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.963
WOW.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.698
IF YOU CARE MORE ABOUT THE POOR,

02:45.765 --> 02:46.666
THEN "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE

02:46.733 --> 02:47.867
THIS PACKAGE."

02:47.934 --> 02:49.836
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE SOMEONE

02:49.903 --> 02:50.570
DEFENDING AN ECONOMIC PLAN AND

02:50.637 --> 02:51.838
MORE LIKE JEFF BEZOS DESCRIBING

02:51.905 --> 02:53.740
HIS PENIS.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.074
BECAUSE IN GENERAL, IT'S NOT

02:55.141 --> 02:56.709
GREAT TO DESCRIBE YOUR CURRENT

02:56.776 --> 02:57.677
GOVERNMENT POLICY THE SAME WAY

02:57.744 --> 02:58.878
YOU'D DESCRIBE LEGACY COLLEGE

02:58.945 --> 03:00.013
ADMISSIONS OR A RONALD REAGAN

03:00.079 --> 03:02.448
DUVET COVER.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.917
RIGHT AFTER THOSE TAX CUTS WERE

03:03.983 --> 03:04.984
ANNOUNCED, U-K FINANCIAL MARKETS

03:05.051 --> 03:06.419
WERE PLUNGED INTO CHAOS, THE

03:06.486 --> 03:08.321
POUND HIT A RECORD LOW AGAINST

03:08.388 --> 03:09.255
THE DOLLAR, AND THE BANK OF

03:09.322 --> 03:10.323
ENGLAND WAS FORCED TO STEP IN TO

03:10.390 --> 03:11.224
PREVENT PENSION FUNDS

03:11.291 --> 03:12.625
COLLAPSING.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.460
MAKING MATTERS WORSE, TRUSS THEN

03:14.527 --> 03:16.262
DISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC VIEW FOR

03:16.329 --> 03:17.764
DAYS, TO THE POINT THAT ONE

03:17.830 --> 03:19.299
BRITISH NEWSPAPER RAN WITH THE

03:19.365 --> 03:20.867
FRONT PAGE, "MISSING: HAVE YOU

03:20.934 --> 03:22.802
SEEN THIS PM?"

03:22.869 --> 03:23.937
AND ALL THIS WAS SUCH A FIASCO,

03:24.003 --> 03:25.538
MEMBERS OF HER OWN PARTY WERE

03:25.605 --> 03:26.172
COMPLAINING TO JOURNALISTS ABOUT

03:26.239 --> 03:30.343
HER.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.110
AN AWFUL LOT OF

03:31.177 --> 03:32.045
TORY MPS ARE GOING "ROUND AND

03:32.111 --> 03:32.946
USING WORDS LIKE "RECKLESS' AND

03:33.012 --> 03:37.517
"MADNESS' TODAY.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.151
ANOTHER BACK BENCH

03:38.217 --> 03:38.851
MP, I'M SHELL-SHOCKED.

03:38.918 --> 03:39.953
ANOTHER SENIOR TORY

03:40.019 --> 03:40.753
BACK-BENCHER, I THOUGHT BORIS

03:40.820 --> 03:41.721
JOHNSON'S CABINET THE WORST IN

03:41.788 --> 03:49.195
HISTORY, THAT ONE'S JUST BEATEN

03:49.262 --> 03:49.596
IT

03:49.662 --> 03:50.229
THIS PERSON IS

03:50.296 --> 03:51.064
SAYING, "PEOPLE-- THAT'S

03:51.130 --> 03:51.731
CONSERVATIVE MPS-- ARE NOW

03:51.798 --> 04:00.340
ASKING, "HOW DO WE GET RID OF

04:00.406 --> 04:00.840
JUST

04:00.907 --> 04:01.741
RECEIVED-I'LL HAVE TO BE-HAVE TO

04:01.808 --> 04:02.675
TIPTOE AROUND THIS, BUT WE'RE

04:02.742 --> 04:03.576
JUST HEARING FROM A FORMER TORY

04:03.643 --> 04:04.310
MINISTER AND CONSERVATIVE MP

04:04.377 --> 04:05.211
SAYING, "LIZ IS,' I CAN'T USE

04:05.278 --> 04:05.945
THE WORD.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.013
'SHE IS,' SAME WORD AGAIN.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.947
WOW.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.015
SHE TOOK OFFICE

04:09.082 --> 04:10.016
LESS THAN A MONTH AGO!

04:10.083 --> 04:10.817
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE A

04:10.883 --> 04:11.851
SHORTER HONEYMOON PERIOD THAN

04:11.918 --> 04:12.919
THAT ARE PRAYING MANTISES.

04:12.986 --> 04:13.953
BUT I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS ANCHOR

04:14.020 --> 04:14.988
READING HER TEXTS ALOUD IN THE

04:15.054 --> 04:16.022
MIDDLE OF A BROADCAST.

04:16.089 --> 04:16.956
I HOPE SHE DOES THAT ALL THE

04:17.023 --> 04:18.658
TIME.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.826
"JUST RECEIVED A TEXT HERE, IT'S

04:19.892 --> 04:20.660
FROM MY FRIEND DANIELLE.

04:20.727 --> 04:21.995
"DO YOU WANT TO GO SEE "BULLET

04:22.061 --> 04:23.563
TRAIN" TOMORROW?

04:23.630 --> 04:24.998
ME AND PETER ARE GOING, WE MIGHT

04:25.064 --> 04:26.366
INVITE TRISH, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S

04:26.432 --> 04:27.433
A BIT OF A-- OOP!

04:27.500 --> 04:30.737
CAN'T USE THAT WORD."

04:31.070 --> 04:32.538
THIS HAS BEEN A TRULY

04:32.605 --> 04:34.007
SPECTACULAR START TO THE LIZ

04:34.073 --> 04:34.641
TRUSS ERA, AS SHE'S SOMEHOW

04:34.707 --> 04:35.942
MANAGED TO THROW THE U-K MARKET

04:36.009 --> 04:36.776
INTO TURMOIL, DISAPPEAR, AND

04:36.843 --> 04:37.844
ENRAGE HER OWN PARTY, ALL IN

04:37.910 --> 04:39.646
LESS THAN A MONTH.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.414
IT IS GENUINELY HARD TO PUT THE

04:41.481 --> 04:43.149
SCALE OF WHAT SHE JUST DID INTO

04:43.216 --> 04:45.018
WORDS-- SADLY, BECAUSE ALL THE

04:45.084 --> 04:46.819
ONES THAT APPLY APPARENTLY,

04:46.886 --> 04:49.055
CAN'T BE SAID ON TELEVISION.

04:49.122 --> 04:55.895
AND NOW, THIS.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.931
AND NOW, SHOPPING NETWORKS

04:58.998 --> 04:59.966
RECOGNIZE QUEEN ELIZABETH'S

05:00.033 --> 05:01.100
DEATH THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW

05:01.167 --> 05:01.267
HOW.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.370
I KNOW THIS IS SUCH A HARD

05:04.437 --> 05:05.405
TIME BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL

05:05.471 --> 05:10.543
QUEEN ELIZABETH JUST PAST BUT

05:10.610 --> 05:11.978
SHE AND HER SISTER WERE ON A

05:12.045 --> 05:13.446
TRIP TO AFRICA AND THIS IS

05:13.513 --> 05:15.148
ELEGANT AND TIMELESS JUST LIKE

05:15.214 --> 05:15.581
HER.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.017
WHAT IS SO WONDERFUL OVER THE

05:18.084 --> 05:20.153
LAST FEW WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE

05:20.219 --> 05:22.822
PASSING OF THE QUEEN HOW WE HAVE

05:22.889 --> 05:25.224
KIND OF RETURNED TO THE LOOK OF

05:25.291 --> 05:25.491
DIAMONDS.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.193
LOCALE WHICH THAT PURPLE IS.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.729
WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE

05:29.796 --> 05:30.897
QUEEN RIGHT NOW AND ENGLAND,

05:30.963 --> 05:32.598
WHAT IS SO GORGEOUS YOU LOOK AT

05:32.665 --> 05:34.400
THIS ROYAL PURPLE, THERE IS AN

05:34.467 --> 05:35.301
ELEGANCE TO THIS.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.003
THE THING ABOUT

05:37.070 --> 05:38.538
QUEEN ELIZABETH, SHE HAD SOMEONE

05:38.604 --> 05:40.640
WHO WORE THEIR SHOES BEFORE SHE

05:40.707 --> 05:42.008
WORE THEM AND BROKE THEM IN, SHE

05:42.075 --> 05:42.942
NEVER HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE SHOE

05:43.009 --> 05:44.911
IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.412
YOU DO NOT NEED SOMEONE TO BREAK

05:46.479 --> 05:48.848
THESE SHOES IN.

05:48.915 --> 05:53.786
HER FAVORITE FLOWER, LILY OF

05:53.853 --> 05:55.088
THE VALLEY FOR OUR LATE QUEEN.

05:58.791 --> 05:59.392
OUR MAIN STORY

05:59.459 --> 06:02.862
TONIGHT CONCERNS

06:02.929 --> 06:03.162
ANTIQUITIES.

06:03.229 --> 06:03.763
RELICS FROM BYGONE TIMES THAT

06:03.830 --> 06:04.397
CAN TELL US STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE

06:04.464 --> 06:05.998
FROM THE PAST.

06:06.065 --> 06:06.666
NANA, BUT LESS OVERTLY

06:06.733 --> 06:07.400
RACIST.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.267
SPECIFICALLY, OUR STORY CONCERNS

06:08.334 --> 06:09.035
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THOSE RELICS

06:09.102 --> 06:10.536
GO MISSING.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.838
I'LL START BY GIVING YOU JUST

06:11.904 --> 06:12.772
IF YOU GO TO

06:12.839 --> 06:13.706
GREECE, YOU MIGHT GO TO THE

06:13.773 --> 06:14.707
ACROPOLIS MUSEUM.

06:14.774 --> 06:15.908
AND WHILE YOU'RE MARVELING AT

06:15.975 --> 06:17.844
SCULPTURES THAT ARE OVER TWO

06:17.910 --> 06:19.545
MILLENNIA OLD, YOU MIGHT NOTICE

06:19.612 --> 06:20.613
SOME ODD DETAILS, LIKE THIS

06:20.680 --> 06:21.848
SCULPTURE, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE

06:21.914 --> 06:23.583
A WHITE FOOT, OR THIS ONE, WHERE

06:23.649 --> 06:25.017
SOMEONE'S WHOLE UPPER HALF SEEMS

06:25.084 --> 06:25.985
TO BE SUDDENLY AND

06:26.052 --> 06:27.453
OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.021
IT'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN THE ART

06:29.088 --> 06:31.157
WORLD AS "SEASON 2 OF THE WIRE."

06:31.224 --> 06:33.392
WELL, THERE'S AN EXPLANATION FOR

06:33.459 --> 06:34.627
WHERE THOSE MISSING PIECES ARE.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.062
AND AS A BRITISH PERSON, I'M A

06:36.129 --> 06:38.464
LITTLE BIT IMPLICATED.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.800
SO THE DARKER STONE IS THE

06:40.867 --> 06:42.068
ORIGINAL WHEREAS THE WHITE

06:42.135 --> 06:43.236
PLASTER, THAT REPRESENTS WHAT'S

06:43.302 --> 06:44.070
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

06:44.137 --> 06:44.504
YES.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.905
EXACTLY.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.572
AND HERE IT IS IN THE BRITISH

06:46.639 --> 06:48.274
MUSEUM.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.509
THE MISSING MARBLE HEAD AND

06:49.575 --> 06:50.576
CHEST FLOATING IN A DISPLAY

06:50.643 --> 06:53.045
SPACE.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.815
YEAH!

06:55.882 --> 06:57.717
WE TOOK IT.

06:57.784 --> 06:58.284
HONESTLY, IF YOU'RE EVER

06:58.351 --> 06:59.318
LOOKING FOR A MISSING ARTIFACT?

06:59.385 --> 06:59.919
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN IT'S IN

06:59.986 --> 07:00.586
THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.387
IT'S BASICALLY THE WORLD'S

07:01.454 --> 07:03.256
LARGEST "LOST & FOUND", WITH

07:03.322 --> 07:04.557
BOTH "LOST" AND "FOUND" IN THE

07:04.624 --> 07:05.191
HEAVIEST POSSIBLE QUOTATION

07:05.258 --> 07:07.193
MARKS.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.628
SPECIFICALLY, THOSE MARBLES--

07:08.694 --> 07:10.429
LONG KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS "THE

07:10.496 --> 07:11.831
ELGIN MARBLES"-- WERE TAKEN BY

07:11.898 --> 07:13.232
LORD ELGIN, A 19TH-CENTURY

07:13.299 --> 07:14.467
BRITISH LORD WHO HACKED THEM OFF

07:14.534 --> 07:16.169
THE PARTHENON.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.937
IT'S SOMETHING THE GREEKS ARE

07:18.004 --> 07:19.605
UNDERSTANDABLY FURIOUS ABOUT.

07:19.672 --> 07:20.740
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T LOST, THEY

07:20.807 --> 07:21.741
WERE TAKEN.

07:21.808 --> 07:22.742
WHICH IS WORSE.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.177
IT'S LIKE BEING UNABLE TO FIND

07:24.243 --> 07:25.845
THE LAST PUZZLE PIECE, AND

07:25.912 --> 07:27.280
LEARNING THAT YOU DIDN'T

07:27.346 --> 07:28.714
ACTUALLY MISPLACE IT-- A

07:28.781 --> 07:30.650
BRITISH EARL SNUCK INTO YOUR

07:30.716 --> 07:32.285
HOUSE, STOLE IT, AND THEN SOLD

07:32.351 --> 07:33.553
IT TO A MUSEUM OVER A THOUSAND

07:33.619 --> 07:35.755
MILES AWAY.

07:35.822 --> 07:36.956
GREECE HAS BEEN DEMANDING THE

07:37.023 --> 07:38.858
RETURN OF THE "ELGIN MARBLES"

07:38.925 --> 07:40.493
FOR DECADES NOW, BUT THE

07:40.560 --> 07:41.194
RESPONSE FROM SOME OF THE

07:41.260 --> 07:41.961
BRITISH MUSEUM'S DEFENDERS HAS

07:42.028 --> 07:42.662
BEEN-- EVEN BY BRITISH

07:42.728 --> 07:43.329
STANDARDS-- UNBELIEVABLY

07:43.396 --> 07:45.331
PATRONIZING.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.733
ONE CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

07:47.800 --> 07:49.635
RETURNING THE ELGIN MARBLES TO

07:49.702 --> 07:51.204
ATHENS UNTIL THE GREEKS START

07:51.270 --> 07:52.305
CARING FOR WHAT THEY ALREADY

07:52.371 --> 07:53.906
HAVE.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.174
I'M SURE THEY'D TAKE GREAT CARE

07:55.241 --> 07:56.108
OF THE PARTHENON SCULPTURES IF

07:56.175 --> 07:58.611
THEY WERE RETURNED.

07:58.678 --> 07:59.612
BUT IF YOU KNEW A WOMAN WAS

07:59.679 --> 08:00.379
ABUSING HER CHILD, YOU WOULDN'T

08:00.446 --> 08:02.415
LET HER ADOPT ANOTHER.

08:02.481 --> 08:03.316
AND THAT'S WHAT THE GREEKS ARE

08:03.382 --> 08:05.284
ASKING FOR.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.220
WHAT?

08:07.286 --> 08:08.621
THAT'S NOT A GREAT COMPARISON,

08:08.688 --> 08:09.822
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT OMITS THE

08:09.889 --> 08:11.424
FACT THAT THE "WOMAN'S CHILD" IN

08:11.490 --> 08:12.525
THIS EXAMPLE WAS BASICALLY

08:12.592 --> 08:14.360
KIDNAPPED.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.595
SO IT'S LESS A WOMAN ASKING TO

08:15.661 --> 08:16.662
ADOPT ANOTHER CHILD THAN IT IS

08:16.729 --> 08:17.964
HER DEMANDING THE RETURN OF HER

08:18.030 --> 08:19.999
FIRST ONE.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.767
THE ELGIN MARBLES

08:21.834 --> 08:22.702
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE RETURNED TO

08:22.768 --> 08:32.812
GREECE.

08:32.879 --> 08:33.412
EVAN THAT WOMAN YOU JUST SAW,

08:33.479 --> 08:33.946
NOW SAYS

08:34.013 --> 08:34.680
SHE THINKS THEY SHOULD GO BACK.

08:34.747 --> 08:35.615
BUT THOSE MARBLES ARE JUST THE

08:35.681 --> 08:36.182
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.116
THE FACT IS, ANTIQUITIES,

08:37.183 --> 08:38.117
LARGELY FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH,

08:38.184 --> 08:38.851
WHICH INCLUDES LATIN AMERICA,

08:38.918 --> 08:39.719
AFRICA, ASIA, AND THE MIDEAST,

08:39.785 --> 08:40.920
HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND ENSHRINED IN

08:40.987 --> 08:41.687
EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN MUSEUMS ON

08:41.754 --> 08:42.488
A LARGER SCALE THAN YOU MAY

08:42.555 --> 08:43.890
REALIZE.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.091
IN 2018, A REPORT COMMISSIONED

08:45.157 --> 08:46.492
BY THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FOUND

08:46.559 --> 08:48.327
THAT OVER NINETY PERCENT OF ALL

08:48.394 --> 08:50.029
AFRICA'S CULTURAL HERITAGE IS

08:50.096 --> 08:51.564
HELD OUTSIDE AFRICA BY MAJOR

08:51.631 --> 08:54.267
MUSEUMS.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.168
BUT AS THE VOICES ARGUING FOR

08:56.235 --> 08:57.970
ANTIQUITIES TO BE RETURNED ARE

08:58.037 --> 08:59.071
GETTING LOUDER, OTHERS ARE

08:59.138 --> 09:01.073
RESISTING ANY CHANGE.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.508
IN 2010, WHEN ASKED WHETHER THE

09:02.575 --> 09:04.310
U-K WOULD EVER RETURN THE

09:04.377 --> 09:06.879
KOH-I-NOOR DIAMOND TO INDIA,

09:06.946 --> 09:08.247
PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON

09:08.314 --> 09:09.448
REFUSED, SAYING, "IF YOU SAY YES

09:09.515 --> 09:10.416
TO ONE, YOU SUDDENLY FIND THE

09:10.483 --> 09:12.852
BRITISH MUSEUM WOULD BE EMPTY."

09:12.919 --> 09:14.086
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.122
IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT SOME

09:16.188 --> 09:16.923
ARE NOW TAKING MATTERS INTO

09:16.989 --> 09:19.225
THEIR OWN HANDS.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.960
IN JUNE, A CONGOLESE ACTIVIST

09:21.027 --> 09:21.894
REMOVED A 19TH CENTURY CHADIAN

09:21.961 --> 09:23.195
FUNERAL POLE FROM THE QUAI

09:23.262 --> 09:24.530
BRANLY MUSEUM IN PARIS AS PART

09:24.597 --> 09:26.065
OF A PROTEST CAMPAIGN AGAINST

09:26.132 --> 09:26.666
PLUNDERING DURING THE COLONIAL

09:26.732 --> 09:32.438
ERA."

09:32.505 --> 09:33.072
YEAH!

09:33.139 --> 09:33.973
OBVIOUSLY THAT MAN WAS UNAWARE

09:34.040 --> 09:34.907
OF THE MUSEUM'S VERY CLEAR

09:34.974 --> 09:40.346
POLICY, "NO STEALING AFRICAN

09:40.413 --> 09:40.913
ANTIQUITIES, STARTING

09:40.980 --> 09:41.914
'NOW.'" SO GIVEN JUST HOW MANY

09:41.981 --> 09:43.249
ANTIQUITIES IN SOME OF THE

09:43.316 --> 09:44.250
WORLD'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS MUSEUMS

09:44.317 --> 09:50.623
ARE ESSENTIALLY STOLEN GOODS,

09:50.690 --> 09:55.328
TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

09:55.394 --> 09:55.594
MUSEUMS.

09:55.661 --> 09:56.462
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LARGER

09:56.529 --> 09:57.029
STORY THAN NORMAL, AND WE'RE

09:57.096 --> 09:57.930
GOING TO DO IT IN TWO MAIN PARTS

09:57.997 --> 09:58.464
FIRST, CONCERNING HOW

09:58.531 --> 09:59.265
ANTIQUITIES ENDED UP IN MUSEUMS

09:59.332 --> 10:00.366
IN THE PAST.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.634
AND THEN, ABOUT THE THRIVING

10:01.701 --> 10:02.268
MODERN MARKET THAT KEEPS THEM

10:02.335 --> 10:03.202
SUPPLIED WITH OBJECTS TO THIS

10:03.269 --> 10:03.803
DAY.

10:03.869 --> 10:04.837
AND LOOK-- WE DON'T HAVE TIME

10:04.904 --> 10:05.438
TO RECAP THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF

10:05.504 --> 10:06.072
COLONIALISM AND THE PLUNDER OF

10:06.138 --> 10:07.273
ANTIQUITIES.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.543
THERE ARE SO MANY STOLEN

10:10.609 --> 10:11.510
ARTIFACTS WE COULD TALK ABOUT--

10:11.577 --> 10:12.178
FROM THE TREASURES OF TIPU

10:12.244 --> 10:14.213
SULTAN, TO THE ZODIAC OF

10:14.280 --> 10:15.081
DENDERA.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.649
BUT IN ORDER TO SAY A LOT IN A

10:16.716 --> 10:18.184
LITTLE, LET'S STAY WITH THE

10:18.250 --> 10:19.151
BRITISH MUSEUM.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.587
IN ITS OWN PROMOTIONAL

10:21.654 --> 10:23.155
MATERIALS, IT MAKES A FEATURE OF

10:23.222 --> 10:24.757
JUST HOW IMPORTANT AND

10:24.824 --> 10:26.525
INFLUENTIAL ITS FOUNDING WAS.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.462
IN JANUARY 1759, THE BRITISH

10:29.528 --> 10:31.163
MUSEUM OPENED ITS DOORS, THE

10:31.230 --> 10:31.897
FIRST NATIONAL PUBLIC MUSEUM OF

10:31.964 --> 10:34.934
THE WORLD.

10:35.001 --> 10:35.835
INITIALLY, THE OBJECTS WERE

10:35.901 --> 10:36.902
BASED ON THE FOUNDING COLLECTION

10:36.969 --> 10:39.105
OF SIR HANS SLOANE.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.974
AND THIS IS HANS SLOANE,

10:42.041 --> 10:44.877
SCHOLAR, ENTREPRENEUR,

10:44.944 --> 10:46.846
PHYSICIAN, WHO WAS CONNECTED

10:46.912 --> 10:50.116
WITH THE BEST MINDS OF HIS TIME.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.118
IN FACT, OUR COLLECTION HAS

10:52.184 --> 10:53.085
ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT CONNECTING

10:53.152 --> 10:55.588
PEOPLE.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.389
OKAY, FIRST, I'M GOING

10:56.455 --> 10:58.157
TO SAY WHAT WE'RE ALL THINKING:

10:58.224 --> 10:59.392
THAT GUY'S DEFINITELY GOOGLED

10:59.458 --> 11:01.060
"COULD NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM

11:01.127 --> 11:02.728
ACTUALLY HAPPEN."

11:02.795 --> 11:04.397
NOT BECAUSE HE'S SCARED OF A BIG

11:04.463 --> 11:06.198
BONY DINOSAUR CHASING HIM, BUT

11:06.265 --> 11:07.466
BECAUSE WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND, HE

11:07.533 --> 11:08.434
"DEFINITELY" FUCKS THE ART AND

11:08.501 --> 11:11.570
DOESN'T WANT ANY OF IT TALKING.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.839
BUT THAT NOTION OF MUSEUMS AS A

11:13.906 --> 11:16.075
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT WITH

11:16.142 --> 11:17.910
OUR SHARED HISTORY, AND WITH

11:17.977 --> 11:19.311
CULTURES ALL OVER THE WORLD,

11:19.378 --> 11:20.846
CLEARLY ISN'T FUNDAMENTALLY BAD.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.615
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT WHOLLY

11:22.681 --> 11:23.816
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL

11:23.883 --> 11:24.583
HISTORY OF HOW MANY MUSEUMS CAME

11:24.650 --> 11:27.253
TO BE.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.220
HANS SLOANE-- WHO

11:28.287 --> 11:30.122
ON HIS BEST DAY, LOOKED LIKE

11:30.189 --> 11:31.190
THAT-- HAD SOME INTERESTING

11:31.257 --> 11:33.692
"CONNECTIONS" OF HIS OWN.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.628
SPECIFICALLY, THE FACT HE WAS

11:35.694 --> 11:37.129
MARRIED TO AN HEIRESS TO SUGAR

11:37.196 --> 11:39.932
PLANTATIONS IN JAMAICA, WORKED

11:39.999 --> 11:41.133
BY ENSLAVED PEOPLE, AND BOUGHT

11:41.200 --> 11:41.734
MANY OBJECTS IN HIS COLLECTION

11:41.801 --> 11:43.002
WITH THAT WEALTH.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.904
MEANING THE MUSEUM'S VERY

11:44.970 --> 11:46.505
FOUNDATIONS ARE INEXTRICABLY

11:46.572 --> 11:48.841
TIED UP IN SLAVERY AND

11:48.908 --> 11:49.775
COLONIALISM, WITH THE SAME BEING

11:49.842 --> 11:50.476
TRUE OF MANY OF ITS MOST PRIZED

11:50.543 --> 11:57.049
HOLDINGS.

11:57.116 --> 11:57.750
TAKE THE BENIN BRONZES, A TERM

11:57.817 --> 11:58.451
THAT REFERS TO A HUGE RANGE OF

11:58.517 --> 11:59.185
OBJECTS PRODUCED IN THE

11:59.251 --> 12:00.152
"KINGDOM" OF BENIN, WHICH IS

12:00.219 --> 12:01.020
CURRENTLY PART OF MODERN-DAY

12:01.087 --> 12:01.654
NIGERIA.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.521
THE BENIN BRONZES WERE LOOTED

12:02.588 --> 12:03.689
FROM THE PALACE OF THE KING OF

12:03.756 --> 12:04.690
BENIN, OR THE "OBA", IN 1897,

12:04.757 --> 12:06.392
AFTER THE BRITISH MILITARY

12:06.459 --> 12:07.760
INVADED AND VIOLENTLY TOPPLED

12:07.827 --> 12:09.295
HIM.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.629
THAT MISSION WAS VINDICTIVE AND

12:10.696 --> 12:11.797
DESTRUCTIVE-- BUT ALSO

12:11.864 --> 12:15.301
EXTREMELY TARGETED.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.069
THE BRITISH SOLDIERS, ARMED

12:17.136 --> 12:18.437
WITH MACHINE GUNS, CONQUERED THE

12:18.504 --> 12:19.338
CITY AND BURNED IT TO THE

12:19.405 --> 12:20.306
GROUND.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.474
BUT NOT BEFORE CAREFULLY TAKING

12:21.540 --> 12:24.877
THOUSANDS OF ARTIFACTS.

12:24.944 --> 12:25.878
THEY PILED THEM UP NEATLY,

12:25.945 --> 12:26.712
PHOTOGRAPHED THEM, AND EVEN

12:26.779 --> 12:29.815
LABELED THEM "LOOT."

12:29.882 --> 12:30.916
THIS PHOTO, TAKEN AT THE BENIN

12:30.983 --> 12:32.952
PALACE AFTER THE RAID, SHOWS

12:33.018 --> 12:34.420
SOLDIERS WITH THE DISMANTLED

12:34.487 --> 12:36.055
PLAQUES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO THE

12:36.122 --> 12:37.156
BRITISH MUSEUM, AND SOLD ALL

12:37.223 --> 12:38.958
OVER THE WORLD.

12:39.024 --> 12:39.892
OKAY, FIRST, THAT'S

12:39.959 --> 12:40.926
AWFUL.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.294
IT'S PRETTY

12:42.361 --> 12:43.562
REMARKABLE THAT A BRITISH

12:43.629 --> 12:44.930
SOLDIER WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF

12:44.997 --> 12:46.098
CAREFULLY LABELLING EACH OF

12:46.165 --> 12:47.266
THOSE PHOTOS, AND THE CAPTIONS

12:47.333 --> 12:48.767
HE USED WERE "LOOT" AND "MORE

12:48.834 --> 12:51.003
LOOT."

12:51.070 --> 12:52.338
AT THE VERY LEAST, HE COULD'VE

12:52.404 --> 12:53.672
CHOSEN SOMETHING DESCRIPTIVE,

12:53.739 --> 12:55.107
LIKE, "DAN, TERRY, AND I AFTER

12:55.174 --> 12:58.511
DOING CULTURAL GENOCIDE."

12:58.577 --> 12:59.945
BUT THE LOOTING OF THE BENIN

13:00.012 --> 13:00.946
BRONZES WASN'T JUST A PHYSICAL

13:01.013 --> 13:02.081
LOSS-- IT WAS A CULTURAL AND

13:02.148 --> 13:06.752
HISTORICAL ONE.

13:06.819 --> 13:07.720
TAKE THESE PLAQUES.

13:07.786 --> 13:08.387
THEY'RE NOT JUST PIECES OF ART.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.121
THEY'RE SOMETHING MUCH MORE

13:09.188 --> 13:10.022
IMPORTANT, AS THIS MEMBER OF THE

13:10.089 --> 13:12.258
BENIN ROYAL FAMILY EXPLAINED.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.426
THOSE THINGS ARE LIKE OUR OWN

13:14.493 --> 13:16.629
DIARIES.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.265
WHATEVER WAS SIGNIFICANT, THE

13:19.331 --> 13:22.001
OBA WOULD TELL THE GUILD OF

13:22.067 --> 13:23.769
BRONZECASTERS TO CAST IT IN

13:23.836 --> 13:26.338
BRONZE.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.908
TO KEEP A RECORD.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.876
SO TAKING THEM AWAY WAS LIKE

13:30.943 --> 13:34.547
YANKING OFF PAGES OF OUR

13:34.613 --> 13:37.183
HISTORY.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.484
RIGHT-- FOR THE PEOPLE

13:38.551 --> 13:40.019
OF BENIN, THESE WERE THEIR

13:40.085 --> 13:40.920
MEMORIES MADE PHYSICAL.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.321
AND THESE PLAQUES WERE LAID OUT

13:42.388 --> 13:44.356
IN A VERY SPECIFIC ORDER, WHICH

13:44.423 --> 13:45.024
WAS THEN LOST WHEN THE BRITISH

13:45.090 --> 13:47.359
TORE THEM FROM THE PALACE WALLS.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.761
MEANING THE BRITISH IN EFFECT

13:48.827 --> 13:50.896
STOLE AND SCRAMBLED A NATION'S

13:50.963 --> 13:53.666
MEMORIES, A CRIME SO FUCKED UP,

13:53.732 --> 13:54.567
EVEN BLACK MIRROR HASN'T THOUGHT

13:54.633 --> 13:56.535
OF IT YET.

13:56.602 --> 14:02.441
NOW, THE BRITISH MUSEUM STILL

14:02.508 --> 14:03.175
HOLDS MORE BRONZES THAN ANYWHERE

14:03.242 --> 14:03.809
ELSE, BUT THEY'RE ALL SCATTERED

14:03.876 --> 14:04.376
AMONG 161 MUSEUMS AND

14:04.443 --> 14:05.044
INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD,

14:05.110 --> 14:06.045
WITH ONLY NINE SUCH INSTITUTIONS

14:06.111 --> 14:06.478
LOCATED IN NIGERIA.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.379
AND UNDERSTANDABLY, THERE'VE

14:07.446 --> 14:08.514
BEEN CALLS FOR THE RETURN OF THE

14:08.581 --> 14:09.815
BRONZES FOR DECADES NOW-- AND A

14:09.882 --> 14:11.717
HANDFUL OF MUSEUMS HAVE COMPLIED

14:11.784 --> 14:15.254
BUT THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAS

14:15.321 --> 14:17.156
REPEATEDLY REFUSED, CONSISTENTLY

14:17.223 --> 14:18.691
POINTING TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM

14:18.757 --> 14:20.359
ACT OF 1963, WHICH EXPLICITLY

14:20.426 --> 14:21.961
FORBIDS IT FROM GIVING AN ITEM

14:22.027 --> 14:23.629
IN ITS COLLECTION AWAY, WITH

14:23.696 --> 14:25.364
VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.599
AND THE THING IS, THAT LAW DOES

14:26.665 --> 14:28.400
EXIST.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.236
BUT LAWS CAN BE CHANGED IF YOU

14:30.302 --> 14:32.504
WANT TO.

14:32.571 --> 14:33.772
AND THE MORE YOU HEAR BRITISH

14:33.839 --> 14:34.773
OFFICIALS TALK, THE CLEARER IT

14:34.840 --> 14:35.708
BECOMES THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT

14:35.774 --> 14:39.245
THEY WANT AT ALL.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.547
WELL, I THINK THAT THEY

14:41.614 --> 14:42.147
PROPERLY RESIDE IN THE BRITISH

14:42.214 --> 14:44.083
MUSEUM.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.851
THE COLLECTIONS OF OUR GREAT

14:45.918 --> 14:47.653
NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN

14:47.720 --> 14:48.787
DEVELOPED OVER MANY, MANY

14:48.854 --> 14:50.623
CENTURIES, IN MANY TIMES, IN

14:50.689 --> 14:53.759
QUESTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.861
I THINK THE QUESTION NOW IS

14:55.928 --> 14:57.563
ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH THESE.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.698
I LOVE THE BENIN BRONZES.

14:59.765 --> 15:00.833
I'VE SEEN THEM MANY TIMES

15:00.899 --> 15:02.301
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND I THINK

15:02.368 --> 15:04.403
THEM BEING IN THE BRITISH

15:04.470 --> 15:06.105
MUSEUM, WHICH IS A WORLD

15:06.171 --> 15:06.839
REPOSITORY OF HERITAGE, ALLOWS

15:06.905 --> 15:08.641
PEOPLE TO SEE IT.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.209
YEAH, THAT OFFENSIVELY

15:10.276 --> 15:12.044
ENGLISH MAN "LOVES" THE BENIN

15:12.111 --> 15:13.412
BRONZES.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.047
AND WHILE I'M SO GLAD THAT

15:15.114 --> 15:16.515
OLIVER JAMES DOWDEN, M-P FOR

15:16.582 --> 15:17.850
HERTSMERE, HAS SEEN THEM "MANY

15:17.916 --> 15:20.085
TIMES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE," THE

15:20.152 --> 15:22.388
FACT IS, NOT EVERYONE GETS TO DO

15:22.454 --> 15:23.722
THAT, AS THIS NIGERIAN ARTIST

15:23.789 --> 15:26.058
AND ART HISTORIAN WILL ATTEST.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.993
1995.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.030
IN LONDON.

15:31.096 --> 15:35.234
THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME OF SEEING

15:35.301 --> 15:39.305
AN ORIGINAL, UH, ANCIENT BENIN

15:39.371 --> 15:40.706
ARTWORK, WAS, YES, AT A BRITISH

15:40.773 --> 15:41.907
MUSEUM.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.442
TO SEE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

15:43.509 --> 15:46.845
THESE OBJECTS- IT WAS A MIXTURE

15:46.912 --> 15:50.783
OF PRIDE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

15:50.849 --> 15:53.419
THESE ANCIENT ARTISTS, AND ANGER

15:53.485 --> 15:55.020
MIXED WITH A SENSE OF LOSS.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.889
MOST NIGERIANS WILL NEVER SEE

15:56.955 --> 15:58.857
THEM.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.592
EXACTLY.

16:00.659 --> 16:01.593
THE GENERATIONS OF BRITISH

16:01.660 --> 16:02.795
CHILDREN WHO'VE GROWN UP

16:02.861 --> 16:04.697
"LOVING" THE BENIN BRONZES COME

16:04.763 --> 16:06.665
AT THE EXPENSE OF GENERATIONS OF

16:06.732 --> 16:08.400
NIGERIANS WHO HAVEN'T.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.102
AND, AGAIN: THIS IS JUST ONE

16:10.169 --> 16:12.171
EXAMPLE, OF SO SO MANY.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.772
AND WHENEVER THE QUESTION OF

16:13.839 --> 16:14.873
RETURNING STOLEN OBJECTS COMES

16:14.940 --> 16:15.974
UP, THERE ARE USUALLY A FEW

16:16.041 --> 16:17.309
STOCK RESPONSES, WHICH ARE WORTH

16:17.376 --> 16:18.277
QUICKLY ADDRESSING.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.244
THE FIRST IS, BASICALLY, THESE

16:19.311 --> 16:21.380
WERE "ACQUIRED" IN A DIFFERENT

16:21.447 --> 16:22.281
TIME, AND YOU CAN'T JUDGE THE

16:22.348 --> 16:23.982
PRESENT BY THE STANDARDS OF THE

16:24.049 --> 16:28.987
PAST.

16:29.054 --> 16:29.722
WHEN FRANCE WAS RECENTLY ROILED

16:29.788 --> 16:30.489
BY

16:30.556 --> 16:31.423
A DEBATE OVER WHETHER TO RETURN

16:31.490 --> 16:32.224
AFRICAN ART, THIS

16:32.291 --> 16:32.825
CATASTROPHICALLY FRENCH ART

16:32.891 --> 16:34.026
HISTORIAN BASICALLY MADE THAT

16:34.093 --> 16:34.326
EXACT CASE.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.994
THESE ARTIFACTS, WHO DO THEY

16:36.061 --> 16:36.662
BELONG TO?

16:36.729 --> 16:37.830
THEY BELONG TO THE MUSEUMS

16:37.896 --> 16:39.131
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.066
BECAUSE THERE ARE LAWS, YOU

16:41.133 --> 16:42.835
KNOW, AND IF-EVEN FOR THE

16:42.901 --> 16:45.337
ARTIFACTS WHICH WERE LOOTED IN

16:45.404 --> 16:48.907
THE 19TH CENTURY, IN THE 19TH

16:48.974 --> 16:50.442
CENTURY OF THE WAR, THERE WAS

16:50.509 --> 16:52.244
LAWS, AND THE LOOTING OF WAR WAS

16:52.311 --> 16:53.545
LEGAL.

16:53.612 --> 16:54.880
MAYBE IT'S NOT MORAL, BUT IT'S

16:54.947 --> 16:56.415
LEGAL.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.717
AND IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK ON

16:58.784 --> 17:00.486
THIS, WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK,

17:00.552 --> 17:01.220
19TH CENTURY, 17TH CENTURY, 16TH

17:01.286 --> 17:02.755
CENTURY?

17:02.821 --> 17:03.989
YOU CANNOT STOP.

17:04.056 --> 17:09.528
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO STOP.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.463
SO.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.664
HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS SO THAT

17:12.731 --> 17:13.465
MAN WILL UNDERSTAND?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.166
"YES, THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

17:14.233 --> 17:15.033
LOWS EXPLICITLY MAKING LOOTING

17:15.100 --> 17:15.934
ILLEGAL, BUT THE IDEA THAT GIVES

17:16.001 --> 17:17.436
YOU CARTE BLANCHE IS, "OW YOU

17:17.503 --> 17:19.338
SAY, "ORSESHIT."

17:19.405 --> 17:20.172
AND SETTING ASIDE THAT "DIDIER

17:20.239 --> 17:21.306
RYKNER, THE LOOTING-APOLOGIST

17:21.373 --> 17:22.508
ART HISTORIAN" SEEMS LESS LIKE A

17:22.574 --> 17:23.809
REAL PERSON AND MORE LIKE A

17:23.876 --> 17:25.043
"HOW WE

17:25.110 --> 17:26.211
SAVED THE EGYPTIANS FROM

17:26.278 --> 17:28.280
THEMSELVES," THE FACT IS,

17:28.347 --> 17:30.149
LOOTING WASN'T JUST AN

17:30.215 --> 17:31.850
ACCEPTABLE, UNAVOIDABLE

17:31.917 --> 17:34.820
BYPRODUCT OF WAR "UNDER ZE LOW."

17:34.887 --> 17:35.788
IT WAS SOMETIMES BAKED INTO THE

17:35.854 --> 17:37.222
PLAN FROM THE OUTSET.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.991
IN FACT, DURING ONE NOTORIOUS

17:39.057 --> 17:41.226
BRITISH RAID IN NORTHERN

17:41.293 --> 17:42.561
ETHIOPIA IN 1868, THE ARMY EVEN

17:42.628 --> 17:45.230
BROUGHT ALONG AN EXPERT FROM THE

17:45.297 --> 17:45.964
BRITISH MUSEUM TO BID FOR SOME

17:46.031 --> 17:47.900
OF THE CHOICEST ITEMS.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.368
AND IMPORTANTLY, PEOPLE KNEW THE

17:49.435 --> 17:50.569
PRACTICE WAS WRONG EVEN BACK

17:50.636 --> 17:53.172
THEN.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.239
AFTER THAT RAID ON ETHIOPIA, THE

17:54.306 --> 17:55.707
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER SAID HE

17:55.774 --> 17:56.975
"DEEPLY LAMENTED, FOR THE SAKE

17:57.042 --> 17:58.644
OF THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE SAKE

17:58.710 --> 18:00.045
OF ALL CONCERNED, THAT THESE

18:00.112 --> 18:01.447
ARTICLES WERE THOUGHT FIT TO BE

18:01.513 --> 18:04.049
BROUGHT AWAY BY A BRITISH ARMY."

18:04.116 --> 18:04.950
AND URGED THAT THEY "BE HELD

18:05.017 --> 18:05.717
ONLY UNTIL THEY COULD BE

18:05.784 --> 18:07.653
RESTORED."

18:07.719 --> 18:11.056
HE WAS SAYING THAT IN 1868!

18:11.123 --> 18:12.090
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FIX A

18:12.157 --> 18:14.893
UTI WITHOUT LEECHES BACK THEN,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.128
BUT KNEW THAT RAIDING OTHER

18:16.195 --> 18:18.397
COUNTRIES FOR THEIR SHIT WAS

18:18.464 --> 18:19.932
"DEEPLY LAMENTABLE' WHICH IS

18:19.998 --> 18:22.801
BRITISH FOR "SUPER FUCKED UP."

18:22.868 --> 18:24.369
NOW, THE SECOND COMMON ARGUMENT

18:24.436 --> 18:26.171
IS THAT OBJECTS ARE ACTUALLY

18:26.238 --> 18:27.439
SAFER UNDER THE CARE OF WESTERN

18:27.506 --> 18:28.841
INSTITUTIONS THAN THEY WOULD BE

18:28.907 --> 18:30.175
IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.510
HERE'S THAT CASE BEING MADE BY

18:31.577 --> 18:32.711
AN ART DEALER, REGARDING

18:32.778 --> 18:34.413
PRE-COLOMBIAN ART FROM PERU.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.116
ACCORDING TO THE LAW, WHICH I

18:38.183 --> 18:40.319
THINK- LIKE TO THINK OF AS

18:40.385 --> 18:41.920
SOLOMON'S LAW, THE ONE WHO LOVES

18:41.987 --> 18:43.989
THE BABY BEST GETS THE BABY, THE

18:44.056 --> 18:44.957
ONE WHO WILL PAY THE MOST FOR

18:45.023 --> 18:47.059
THE BABY GETS THE BABY.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.294
IF PERU CANNOT PROPERLY TAKE

18:49.361 --> 18:52.130
CARE OF ITS NATIONAL TREASURES,

18:52.197 --> 18:52.898
THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL TAKE

18:52.965 --> 18:54.733
CARE OF IT FOR THE PERUVIANS, AS

18:54.800 --> 18:57.169
IT SHOULD BE.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.505
HE SEEMS GREAT.

18:59.571 --> 19:00.906
BUT HE'S RIGHT-- IT'S EXACTLY

19:00.973 --> 19:04.109
AS KING SOLOMON FAMOUSLY

19:04.176 --> 19:04.977
"THE REAL MOTHER IS

19:05.043 --> 19:05.744
WHOEVER AGREES TO OFFER 200

19:05.811 --> 19:06.478
THOUSAND OVER THE ASKING PRICE

19:06.545 --> 19:08.413
ALL CASH, INSPECTION WAIVED."

19:08.480 --> 19:09.648
AND THE ARGUMENT, "YOU CAN'T BE

19:09.715 --> 19:11.149
TRUSTED WITH YOUR OWN PROPERTY,

19:11.216 --> 19:13.919
YOU'LL JUST DAMAGE IT" IS HARD

19:13.986 --> 19:15.888
TO LAND, EVEN BEFORE YOU LEARN

19:15.954 --> 19:17.322
THAT THE CARETAKING RECORD OF

19:17.389 --> 19:19.691
SOME MUSEUMS IS MIXED AT BEST.

19:19.758 --> 19:20.626
REMEMBER THAT WOMAN INSISTING

19:20.692 --> 19:21.793
THE GREEKS COULDN'T POSSIBLY

19:21.860 --> 19:22.995
TAKE CARE OF THE PARTHENON

19:23.061 --> 19:24.630
MARBLES?

19:24.696 --> 19:26.532
HERE'S A FUN FACT: MULTIPLE

19:26.598 --> 19:27.766
LEAKS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE

19:27.833 --> 19:30.035
BRITISH MUSEUM'S GREEK

19:30.102 --> 19:30.969
GALLERIES, AND IN THE 1930S, IN

19:31.036 --> 19:32.137
WHAT MUSEUM OFFICIALS LATER

19:32.204 --> 19:33.805
ADMITTED WAS A "HEAVY HANDED"

19:33.872 --> 19:35.340
ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THE SCULPTURES,

19:35.407 --> 19:36.608
THEY ACTIVELY DAMAGED THEM BY

19:36.675 --> 19:37.809
SCRUBBING THEM WITH WIRE BRUSHES

19:37.876 --> 19:40.145
AND A HARSH CLEANING AGENT.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.414
AND LOOK-- EVEN UNDER SOLOMON'S

19:42.481 --> 19:44.383
LAW, "WHOEVER LOVES THE BABY

19:44.449 --> 19:46.251
GETS THE BABY, BUT IF YOU SCRUB

19:46.318 --> 19:46.985
THE BABY WITH WIRE BRUSHES, WE

19:47.052 --> 19:51.023
TAKE THE BABY AWAY."

19:51.089 --> 19:53.358
AND THE FINAL ARGUMENT YOU HEAR

19:53.425 --> 19:54.860
IS THAT THESE MUSEUMS ARE AN

19:54.927 --> 19:56.495
OPEN REPOSITORY OF THE WORLD'S

19:56.562 --> 19:57.362
TREASURES, AND CAN ACTUALLY

19:57.429 --> 19:58.397
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

19:58.463 --> 19:59.865
WHO CAN ENJOY THEM.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.400
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN SOMEONE

20:01.466 --> 20:02.501
POINT OUT, THAT'S ONLY TRUE IF

20:02.568 --> 20:03.602
YOU CAN GET TO THE MUSEUM IN

20:03.669 --> 20:06.171
QUESTION.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.240
ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST

20:08.307 --> 20:09.408
DISPLAY ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF

20:09.474 --> 20:10.809
THEIR COLLECTIONS.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.677
THE BRITISH MUSEUM, FOR

20:11.743 --> 20:12.811
INSTANCE, HAS A COLLECTION OF

20:12.878 --> 20:13.779
EIGHT MILLION OBJECTS, THOUGH

20:13.845 --> 20:14.546
ONLY AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND OF

20:14.613 --> 20:16.048
THEM-- ONE PERCENT-- ARE ON

20:16.114 --> 20:17.883
PUBLIC DISPLAY AT ANY ONE TIME.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.351
AND IT CAN BE PRETTY GALLING FOR

20:19.418 --> 20:21.353
PEOPLE TO FIND THAT THEIR

20:21.420 --> 20:22.321
HERITAGE-- WHICH IS OFTEN PART

20:22.387 --> 20:24.590
OF A VIBRANT PRESENT-DAY CULTURE

20:24.656 --> 20:26.258
IS SITTING IN STORAGE IN THE

20:26.325 --> 20:27.926
BRITISH MUSEUM'S UNDERGROUND

20:27.993 --> 20:32.497
LOOT PRISON.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.298
HERE IN THE US, WE'VE STASHED

20:33.365 --> 20:33.832
AWAY MANY NATIVE AMERICAN

20:33.899 --> 20:34.466
ARTIFACTS.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.434
JUST WATCH AS MEMBERS OF THE

20:35.500 --> 20:36.401
EASTERN SHOSHONE AND NORTHERN

20:36.468 --> 20:38.537
ARAPAHOE TRIBES ARE ALLOWED TO

20:38.604 --> 20:39.271
VISIT ARTIFACTS IN STORAGE AT

20:39.338 --> 20:42.007
CHICAGO'S FIELD MUSEUM.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.141
SO JUST BEYOND HERE IS THE

20:43.208 --> 20:44.910
STOREROOM WHERE WE'LL BE LOOKING

20:44.977 --> 20:54.152
AT SOME OF THE ARTIFACTS.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.364
WHEN I THINK ABOUT OBJECTS

21:05.430 --> 21:07.499
THAT BELONG TO TRIBAL MEMBERS

21:07.566 --> 21:08.400
THAT ARE JUST SITTING THERE IN

21:08.467 --> 21:13.605
THE DARK, I FELT ANGRY.

21:13.672 --> 21:17.109
AND I FELT SAD.

21:17.175 --> 21:21.146
YOU JUST WALK IN AND THERE IS

21:21.213 --> 21:22.447
JUST LIKE ROWS AND ROWS AND ROWS

21:22.514 --> 21:25.550
OF ALL THESE OBJECTS.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.918
THEY'VE BEEN BOXED AWAY SINCE

21:26.985 --> 21:29.454
THEY WERE COLLECTED.

21:29.521 --> 21:33.392
NOBODY CAN SEE THEM, TOUCH THEM,

21:33.458 --> 21:35.293
BE AROUND THEM.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.295
THAT'S DEVASTATING.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.563
AND IT GETS A LOT HARDER TO

21:38.630 --> 21:39.564
PRETEND THESE OBJECTS ARE

21:39.631 --> 21:40.966
FULFILLING A MISSION OF

21:41.033 --> 21:42.300
EDUCATING AND CONNECTING PEOPLE,

21:42.367 --> 21:43.702
WHEN THEY'RE IN A BASEMENT IN A

21:43.769 --> 21:44.703
BOX LABELED WITH A FUCKING

21:44.770 --> 21:46.471
SHARPIE.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.739
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MAY BE

21:47.806 --> 21:48.674
THINKING, "WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE

21:48.740 --> 21:49.574
SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THOSE

21:49.641 --> 21:50.342
OBJECTS IN THE PAST.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.843
BUT NOW WE KNOW BETTER."

21:51.910 --> 21:52.477
THIS

21:52.544 --> 21:54.012
PRACTICE IS STILL VERY MUCH

21:54.079 --> 21:55.580
GOING ON.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.716
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

21:57.783 --> 21:58.483
THE

21:58.550 --> 22:00.118
MODERN ANTIQUITIES MARKET.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.054
BECAUSE ITEMS ARE STILL BEING

22:02.120 --> 22:04.222
BOUGHT, SOLD AND DONATED ALL THE

22:04.289 --> 22:05.223
TIME BETWEEN PRIVATE

22:05.290 --> 22:06.358
INDIVIDUALS, MUSEUMS, DEALERS

22:06.425 --> 22:07.926
AND AUCTION HOUSES.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.828
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE

22:09.895 --> 22:10.729
ITEMS, THE KEY WORD TO

22:10.796 --> 22:12.297
UNDERSTAND IS "PROVENANCE."

22:12.364 --> 22:13.632
BASICALLY, THE FULL HISTORY OF

22:13.699 --> 22:15.067
AN OBJECT AND THE PATH IT TOOK

22:15.133 --> 22:16.802
TO END UP HERE.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.403
BECAUSE NOT EVERY PIECE IS LIKE

22:18.470 --> 22:20.005
THOSE FAMOUS BENIN BRONZES,

22:20.072 --> 22:22.708
WHERE IT'S CLEAR FROM OUR

22:22.774 --> 22:24.643
HISTORY BOOKS WHO TOOK THEM.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.511
FOR MOST ITEMS, RESEARCH INTO

22:26.578 --> 22:28.180
PROVENANCE IS CRITICAL-- IT'S

22:28.246 --> 22:29.981
NOT JUST HOW YOU KNOW WHETHER AN

22:30.048 --> 22:30.982
ITEM IS REAL OR FAKE, BUT ALSO

22:31.049 --> 22:32.017
WHETHER OR NOT IT GOT TO YOU

22:32.084 --> 22:34.052
LEGALLY.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.220
THE AUCTION HOUSE SOTHEBY'S EVEN

22:35.287 --> 22:36.521
HAS A WHOLE VIDEO ON ITS

22:36.588 --> 22:38.390
WEBSITE, BRAGGING ABOUT HOW MUCH

22:38.457 --> 22:40.325
IT LOVES RESEARCHING PROVENANCE

22:40.392 --> 22:41.793
THOUGH IT SEEMS TO VIEW IT

22:41.860 --> 22:43.595
LESS AS AN ETHICAL IMPERATIVE

22:43.662 --> 22:44.563
AND MORE AS A SWEET MARKETING

22:44.629 --> 22:46.531
PERK.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.632
SO PROVENANCE-

22:47.699 --> 22:47.933
THAT'S MY

22:47.999 --> 22:48.533
FAVORITE PART.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.235
PROVENANCE IS THE HISTORY OF

22:50.302 --> 22:51.603
OWNERSHIP FOR A WORK.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.839
SINCE IT WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE-

22:53.905 --> 22:54.506
WHO THAT WORK OF ART HAD BEEN

22:54.573 --> 22:55.307
MADE FOR-

22:55.373 --> 22:56.341
WHOSE WALLS IT'S

22:56.408 --> 22:57.876
BEEN HANGING ON.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.077
HOW MANY DIFFERENT HANDS HAS

22:59.144 --> 22:59.945
IT PASSED THROUGH.

23:00.011 --> 23:00.946
WHO ELSE HAS LOOKED AT IT, IN

23:01.012 --> 23:01.780
SOME CASES, WHO ELSE HAS LOVED

23:01.847 --> 23:02.781
IT.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.583
WHO WORE IT, WHEN DID SHE

23:04.649 --> 23:05.584
WEAR IT, HOW DID SHE WEAR IT,

23:05.650 --> 23:06.218
HOW OFTEN DID SHE WEAR IT?

23:06.284 --> 23:07.953
FOR ME, THIS IS WHAT WE KIND OF

23:08.019 --> 23:08.920
LIVE FOR, IS TO GET THE GREAT

23:08.987 --> 23:09.588
STORIES TO TELL.

23:09.654 --> 23:10.789
AND OFTEN THE STORY OF ITS

23:10.856 --> 23:12.124
OWNERSHIP CAN BE JUST AS

23:12.190 --> 23:13.592
INTERESTING, IF NOT MORE

23:13.658 --> 23:14.726
INTERESTING, THAN THE ARTIST.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.962
PROVENANCE IS SOMETHING THAT,

23:17.028 --> 23:17.929
IN A WAY, DOESN'T MATTER.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.398
AND YET, AND YET.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.967
AND YET, IN ANOTHER

23:22.033 --> 23:25.170
WAY, IT REALLY DOES.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.404
NEVER IN MY LIFE

23:26.471 --> 23:27.372
HAS THERE BEEN SUCH AN

23:27.439 --> 23:28.273
INTIMIDATINGLY BOUGIE COLLECTION

23:28.340 --> 23:30.242
OF PEOPLE.

23:30.308 --> 23:31.443
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THEM SAYING,

23:31.510 --> 23:32.310
"ACTUALLY, IT'S PRONOUNCED

23:32.377 --> 23:34.613
CWOISSANT."

23:34.679 --> 23:36.114
AND WHILE I DON'T DOUBT

23:36.181 --> 23:37.949
SOTHEBY'S LOVES BACKSTORIES THAT

23:38.016 --> 23:39.918
ADD LUSTER AND, CRUCIALLY, VALUE

23:39.985 --> 23:41.319
TO THE OBJECTS THEY AUCTION,

23:41.386 --> 23:42.921
THEY, AND MANY OTHERS, SEEM MUCH

23:42.988 --> 23:44.156
LESS INTERESTED WHEN THOSE

23:44.222 --> 23:45.323
STORIES UNCOVER SOMETHING

23:45.390 --> 23:46.725
SEAMIER.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.693
ONE GALLERY OWNER WHO RECENTLY

23:48.760 --> 23:50.295
PLED GUILTY FOR HER PART IN

23:50.362 --> 23:51.696
TRAFFICKING LOOTED ANTIQUITIES

23:51.763 --> 23:53.231
SAID BUYING AND SELLING OBJECTS

23:53.298 --> 23:54.966
WITH VAGUE OR EVEN NO PROVENANCE

23:55.033 --> 23:56.701
WAS SO MUCH THE NORM IN THE ART

23:56.768 --> 23:58.203
MARKET, IT WAS A "CONSPIRACY OF

23:58.270 --> 24:01.072
THE WILLING."

24:01.139 --> 24:02.641
AND TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THAT

24:02.707 --> 24:04.376
CONSPIRACY CAN LOOK LIKE, JUST

24:04.442 --> 24:06.244
LOOK AT ONE ATTEMPTED SALE WHERE

24:06.311 --> 24:06.978
SOTHEBY'S IGNORED SOME PRETTY

24:07.045 --> 24:08.713
GLARING WARNING SIGNS.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.582
THREE YEARS AGO, CAMBODIA

24:10.649 --> 24:12.150
LEARNED THAT SOTHEBY'S AUCTION

24:12.217 --> 24:13.819
HOUSE IN MANHATTAN WAS

24:13.885 --> 24:14.920
ATTEMPTING TO SELL A

24:14.986 --> 24:16.721
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD MASTERPIECE

24:16.788 --> 24:19.691
FOR $3 MILLION, THE FEET OF

24:19.758 --> 24:21.259
WHICH WERE STILL AT THE TEMPLE

24:21.326 --> 24:22.861
IN CAMBODIA.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.830
SOTHEBY'S WAS WARNED BY THE VERY

24:24.896 --> 24:27.499
EXPERT THEY HIRED TO APPRAISE

24:27.566 --> 24:28.600
THE STATUTE THAT IT WAS, QUOTE,

24:28.667 --> 24:29.568
"DEFINITELY STOLEN."

24:29.634 --> 24:31.169
THEY KNEW THE FEET WERE STILL

24:31.236 --> 24:33.738
THERE.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.440
DESPITE WHAT THEIR EXPERT TOLD

24:35.507 --> 24:37.776
THEM, THEY DECIDED TO PUT THE

24:37.843 --> 24:38.944
STATUE ON THE FRONT OF ONE OF

24:39.010 --> 24:40.178
THEIR MORE PROMINENT AUCTION

24:40.245 --> 24:41.680
CATALOGS OF THE YEAR.

24:41.746 --> 24:43.081
HOLY SHIT.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.050
HOW DID THAT CONVERSATION GO?

24:45.116 --> 24:46.985
THE EXPERT SAID, "THIS IS

24:47.052 --> 24:48.720
DEFINITELY STOLEN."

24:48.787 --> 24:50.021
AND SOTHEBY'S SAID, "YEAH, BUT

24:50.088 --> 24:52.023
IT MIGHT NOT BE, RIGHT?"

24:52.090 --> 24:54.359
AND THE EXPERT SAID, "NO, IT'S

24:54.426 --> 24:55.393
STOLEN."

24:55.460 --> 24:56.261
AND SOTHEBY'S SAID, "YOU'RE SO

24:56.328 --> 24:56.695
FUNNY."

24:56.761 --> 24:57.596
AND THE EXPERT SAID, "WHAT?"

24:57.662 --> 24:58.196
AND SOTHEBY'S SAID.'SERIOUSLY,

24:58.263 --> 24:58.864
JAMIE, YOU'RE TOO MUCH!"

24:58.930 --> 24:59.831
AND THE EXPERT SAID, "THANKS.

24:59.898 --> 25:00.932
BUT, AGAIN, IT IS STOLEN."

25:00.999 --> 25:01.967
AND SOTHEBY'S SAID, "TELL YOUR

25:02.033 --> 25:03.101
MOM I SAID HI."

25:03.168 --> 25:04.102
AND THE EXPERT SAID, "MY MOM IS

25:04.169 --> 25:05.303
DEAD."

25:05.370 --> 25:06.872
AND THEN THEY PRINTED IT ON THE

25:06.938 --> 25:08.506
COVER.

25:08.573 --> 25:10.008
NOW, LEGALLY, I HAVE TO TELL

25:10.075 --> 25:10.976
SOTHEBY'S INSISTS THEY DID

25:11.042 --> 25:12.277
NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THEY

25:12.344 --> 25:13.411
CONDUCT EXTENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE

25:13.478 --> 25:14.713
BEFORE OFFERING ITEMS UP FOR

25:14.779 --> 25:16.181
AUCTION.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.783
IN THE CASE

25:18.850 --> 25:20.018
OF THAT STATUE, FEDERAL

25:20.085 --> 25:21.653
PROSECUTORS EVENTUALLY

25:21.720 --> 25:22.787
INTERVENED, FORCING SOTHEBY'S TO

25:22.854 --> 25:24.222
HAND IT OVER TO CAMBODIA, WHERE

25:24.289 --> 25:29.661
IT WAS EVENTUALLY HAPPILY

25:29.728 --> 25:30.362
REUNITED WITH ITS FEET.

25:30.428 --> 25:30.996
IT'S A

25:31.062 --> 25:32.097
REAL CINDERELLA STORY, IF

25:32.163 --> 25:33.865
CINDERELLA HAD BEEN AMPUTATED AT

25:33.932 --> 25:35.834
THE ANKLE.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.737
AND INTERESTINGLY, IT'S NOT

25:38.803 --> 25:39.871
UNCOMMON TO SEE STATUES MISSING

25:39.938 --> 25:40.739
FEET OR HANDS.

25:40.805 --> 25:41.940
AND WHILE YOU MIGHT ASSUME IT'S

25:42.007 --> 25:44.242
DAMAGE DUE TO TIME, IT'S OFTEN A

25:44.309 --> 25:45.677
SIGN IT'S BEEN STOLEN, WITH

25:45.744 --> 25:47.145
LOOTERS OR THIEVES SAWING OFF

25:47.212 --> 25:49.881
HEADS TO SELL SEPARATELY, OR

25:49.948 --> 25:52.083
HACKING A SCULPTURE OUT FROM A

25:52.150 --> 25:53.752
TEMPLE WALL SO RAPIDLY, THEY

25:53.818 --> 25:55.921
LEAVE THE FEET BEHIND.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.923
AND IF I KNOW THIS, AND YOU NOW

25:57.989 --> 25:58.924
KNOW THIS, THEN SOTHEBY'S

25:58.990 --> 26:01.826
"DEFINITELY" FUCKING DID.

26:01.893 --> 26:02.928
AND, AGAIN, THIS IS WHY

26:02.994 --> 26:03.962
PROVENANCE RESEARCH IS SO

26:04.029 --> 26:05.297
VITALLY IMPORTANT.

26:05.363 --> 26:06.665
BUT MANY BUYERS FAIL TO DO EVEN

26:06.731 --> 26:08.767
THE BARE MINIMUM-- MEANING THE

26:08.833 --> 26:11.403
DEMAND FOR STOLEN GOODS WILL

26:11.469 --> 26:16.541
ALWAYS BE MET BY A STEADY

26:16.608 --> 26:17.609
SUPPLY.

26:17.676 --> 26:18.710
JUST WATCH AS A DEALER IN

26:18.777 --> 26:19.678
NEPALESE ARTIFACTS DEEPAK

26:19.744 --> 26:21.479
SHAKYA, BASICALLY WALKS SOMEONE

26:21.546 --> 26:22.480
THROUGH JUST HOW EASY IT CAN BE

26:22.547 --> 26:23.915
TO GET PAPERWORK TO JUSTIFY

26:23.982 --> 26:24.549
REMOVING AN OBJECT FROM THE

26:24.616 --> 26:25.583
COUNTRY.

26:25.650 --> 26:26.785
BY LAW, THE COUNTRY'S

26:26.851 --> 26:28.853
DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY CANNOT

26:28.920 --> 26:30.355
ISSUE EXPORT PAPERS ON ITEMS

26:30.422 --> 26:32.757
MORE THAN 100 YEARS OLD.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.526
BUT DEEPAK SAYS HE HAS A TRIED

26:34.592 --> 26:36.461
AND PROVEN WAY.

26:36.528 --> 26:37.295
SO GOVERNMENT, NO PROBLEM

26:37.362 --> 26:38.229
GETTING THESE OUT?

26:38.296 --> 26:39.297
NO.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.166
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO GIVE SOME

26:41.232 --> 26:41.866
MONEY UNDER THE TABLE, BUT

26:41.933 --> 26:46.705
OTHERWISE NO PROBLEM.

26:46.771 --> 26:47.172
OKAY.

26:47.238 --> 26:51.309
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LEGAL-

26:51.376 --> 26:51.943
OKAY.

26:52.010 --> 26:52.711
BUT STILL, I MEAN, WE CAN GET

26:52.777 --> 26:53.378
IT DONE, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.412
OKAY, THAT'S WAY TOO

26:54.479 --> 26:55.280
EASY.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.015
I DON'T KNOW HOW HARD IT SHOULD

26:57.082 --> 26:57.949
BE TO ILLEGALLY EXPORT A

26:58.016 --> 26:59.017
CULTURE'S TREASURED ANTIQUITIES,

26:59.084 --> 27:00.185
BUT IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE HARDER

27:00.251 --> 27:02.721
THAN "FIND A GUY WHO HAS A GUY."

27:02.787 --> 27:04.789
THAT MAN WAS LATER ARRESTED AND

27:04.856 --> 27:06.791
CHARGED, PRESUMABLY ALARMING

27:06.858 --> 27:07.659
MUSEUMS WITH LARGE COLLECTIONS

27:07.726 --> 27:10.495
FROM NEPAL.

27:10.562 --> 27:11.896
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

27:11.963 --> 27:13.498
THOSE DOCUMENTARY MAKERS SAT

27:13.565 --> 27:14.566
DOWN WITH A REPRESENTATIVE FROM

27:14.632 --> 27:15.633
THE RUBIN MUSEUM, HERE IN NEW

27:15.700 --> 27:16.801
YORK, TO ASK A PRETTY BASIC

27:16.868 --> 27:18.870
QUESTION.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.239
IN NEPAL, AUTHORITIES

27:21.306 --> 27:23.108
RECENTLY ARRESTED A NUMBER OF

27:23.174 --> 27:31.483
ANTIQUE DEALERS.

27:31.549 --> 27:32.183
HAS THE RUBIN MUSEUM DONE ANY

27:32.250 --> 27:32.784
DEALINGS WITH DEEPAK SHAKYA OR

27:32.851 --> 27:34.185
HIS FAMILY, THE SHAKYAS?

27:34.252 --> 27:34.719
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

27:34.786 --> 27:37.355
ANSWER THAT.

27:37.422 --> 27:37.922
I MEAN-

27:37.989 --> 27:38.556
THE MUSEUM'S PR

27:38.623 --> 27:40.658
PERSON INTERVENES.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.227
I DON'T-I MEAN, WE WOULD

27:42.293 --> 27:42.894
OBVIOUSLY LOOK INTO OUR-YOU

27:42.961 --> 27:43.695
KNOW, WE'D HAVE TO DO A LOT OF

27:43.762 --> 27:45.163
RESEARCH TO KNOW THAT.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.264
DO YOU WANT TO SAY THAT?

27:46.331 --> 27:46.865
DO YOU WANT US TO LIKE, GET

27:46.931 --> 27:47.599
BACK TO YOU ABOUT IT?

27:47.665 --> 27:48.233
THAT WOULD BE, YEAH, THAT'D

27:48.299 --> 27:49.868
BE GOOD.

27:49.934 --> 27:51.269
OKAY, A PRETTY GOOD

27:51.336 --> 27:53.438
RULE, WHEN YOU'RE ASKED "DO YOU

27:53.505 --> 27:54.539
WORK WITH ART THIEVES?", IS THAT

27:54.606 --> 27:55.507
ANY ANSWER THAT'S NOT AN

27:55.573 --> 27:56.441
IMMEDIATE "NO" IS INSTANTLY

27:56.508 --> 27:58.977
SUSPICIOUS.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.311
AND WHILE THE RUBIN LATER

28:00.378 --> 28:01.312
CLAIMED THAT, TO THEIR BEST

28:01.379 --> 28:02.547
KNOWLEDGE, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY

28:02.614 --> 28:04.382
CONNECTION TO DEEPAK SHAKYA, OR

28:04.449 --> 28:06.618
ANY OBJECTS FROM HIM, THEY DID

28:06.684 --> 28:07.786
RETURN THESE TWO OBJECTS FROM

28:07.852 --> 28:08.787
THEIR COLLECTION JUST THIS YEAR,

28:08.853 --> 28:10.388
THAT "WERE" STOLEN.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.023
AND THE NEPALESE GROUP THAT

28:12.090 --> 28:13.024
PRESSURED THEM TO DO THAT,

28:13.091 --> 28:14.526
RECENTLY IDENTIFIED ANOTHER

28:14.592 --> 28:16.027
OBJECT THEY SAY IS STOLEN WHICH

28:16.094 --> 28:17.495
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS-- JUST

28:17.562 --> 28:18.463
HAPPENS TO BE IN THE RUBIN RIGHT

28:18.530 --> 28:19.464
NOW.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.066
BUT DON'T WORRY, THEY TOLD US

28:21.132 --> 28:21.666
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THAT ONE

28:21.733 --> 28:22.567
NOW, TOO.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.234
AND I'M SURE THEY'LL GET BACK TO

28:23.301 --> 28:24.469
US.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.905
IT'S WHAT THEY DO.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.374
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE LOTS

28:29.441 --> 28:31.242
OF DEALERS AROUND, WHO USE

28:31.309 --> 28:32.143
MUSEUMS TO LAUNDER THEIR

28:32.210 --> 28:35.213
REPUTATIONS.

28:35.280 --> 28:35.980
TAKE SUBHASH KAPOOR.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.015
WHO WAS ONCE ONE OF THE LEADING

28:37.082 --> 28:38.283
SOURCES OF ASIAN ART FOR MUSEUMS

28:38.349 --> 28:39.651
AND COLLECTORS.

28:39.717 --> 28:42.120
THE MET CURRENTLY HAS 86 OBJECTS

28:42.187 --> 28:43.688
FROM HIM IN ITS COLLECTION, AND

28:43.755 --> 28:45.423
EVEN THREW HIM A PRIVATE

28:45.490 --> 28:46.424
RECEPTION IN 2009 AFTER HE

28:46.491 --> 28:48.126
DONATED DOZENS OF INDIAN

28:48.193 --> 28:49.661
DRAWINGS.

28:49.727 --> 28:51.296
WHICH WAS A REAL WIN-WIN.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.431
THE MET GOT THE DRAWINGS, AND

28:53.498 --> 28:56.267
KAPOOR GOT TO TELL PEOPLE HE HAD

28:56.334 --> 28:57.836
ART IN THE MET, AND IT'S NOT

28:57.902 --> 28:58.403
LIKE THEY WOULD WORK WITH A

28:58.470 --> 28:59.737
DISREPUTABLE DEALER, RIGHT?

28:59.804 --> 29:00.972
BUT KAPOOR WAS ULTIMATELY

29:01.039 --> 29:02.674
IDENTIFIED AS A PROLIFIC

29:02.740 --> 29:04.142
TRAFFICKER OF STOLEN GOODS.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.144
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER COMING

29:06.211 --> 29:07.579
UP WITH GOOD COVER STORIES.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.547
THE MOST COMMON ONE HE USED WAS

29:09.614 --> 29:10.682
THAT OBJECTS HAD COME FROM THE

29:10.748 --> 29:12.417
FAMILY COLLECTION OF HIS

29:12.484 --> 29:14.486
GIRLFRIEND.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.187
AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING,

29:16.254 --> 29:16.988
"THAT'S SO STUPID IT WOULD ONLY

29:17.055 --> 29:17.889
WORK ON A GROUP OF REAL DING

29:17.956 --> 29:18.756
DONGS."

29:18.823 --> 29:20.458
TO WHICH I'D SAY, "YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:20.525 --> 29:21.292
IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED ON THE

29:21.359 --> 29:24.562
MET 86 TIMES."

29:24.629 --> 29:26.798
AND BUYING ART WITHOUT DOING

29:26.865 --> 29:27.932
PROPER PROVENANCE RESEARCH CAN

29:27.999 --> 29:29.100
BLOW UP IN A MUSEUM'S FACE, IN

29:29.167 --> 29:30.535
SPECTACULAR FASHION.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.337
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED A FEW YEARS

29:32.403 --> 29:33.438
BACK AT THE MET GALA.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.639
THE YEAR?

29:34.706 --> 29:35.907
2018.

29:35.974 --> 29:36.908
KIM KARDASHIAN MADE AN

29:36.975 --> 29:38.209
APPEARANCE WEARING HEAD-TO-TOE

29:38.276 --> 29:39.577
ATELIER VERSACE, THAT WAS,

29:39.644 --> 29:42.046
NOTABLY, GOLD, JUST LIKE THIS

29:42.113 --> 29:43.748
GUY, NEDJEMANKH, OR MORE

29:43.815 --> 29:46.017
SPECIFICALLY, HIS COFFIN, WHICH

29:46.084 --> 29:46.951
THE MET HAD RECENTLY ACQUIRED.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.386
GUYS, A PHOTO OPP OF THE TWO OF

29:48.453 --> 29:50.655
THEM HAD TO HAPPEN!

29:50.722 --> 29:51.456
IT DID, THE INTERNET

29:51.523 --> 29:54.058
EXPLODED.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.561
BUT THEN, THIS HAPPENED.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.429
THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF

29:58.496 --> 29:59.764
ART NEW YORK RECEIVING A TIP

29:59.831 --> 30:05.470
AFTER KIM'S PHOTO FROM THE MET

30:05.537 --> 30:06.104
GALA WENT VIRAL.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.372
THE MANHATTAN ASSISTANT

30:07.438 --> 30:08.306
DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS EMAILED

30:08.373 --> 30:09.340
THE PHOTO BY AN ANONYMOUS

30:09.407 --> 30:10.241
INFORMANT IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

30:10.308 --> 30:11.376
SAYING HE RECOGNIZED THE COFFIN

30:11.442 --> 30:12.844
AND KNEW IT HAD BEEN LOOTED.

30:12.911 --> 30:13.945
MUSEUM OFFICIALS SAYING THEY

30:14.012 --> 30:14.946
BOUGHT THE SARCOPHAGUS FOR $4

30:15.013 --> 30:17.282
MILLION FROM AN ART DEALER IN

30:17.348 --> 30:18.750
PARIS IN 2017, BUT WERE FOOLED

30:18.816 --> 30:20.051
BY FAKE PAPERS SAYING IT HAD

30:20.118 --> 30:21.419
BEEN LEGITIMATELY EXPORTED

30:21.486 --> 30:22.954
DECADES AGO.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.455
WOW.

30:24.522 --> 30:26.491
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT KIM

30:26.558 --> 30:27.859
KARDASHIAN-- THE WOMAN HAS A

30:27.926 --> 30:28.826
REAL KNACK FOR PRODUCING

30:28.893 --> 30:29.961
INCREDIBLE IMAGES, JUST BY

30:30.028 --> 30:31.229
STANDING NEXT TO MEN THAT LOOK

30:31.296 --> 30:36.601
LIKE THEY DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.969
IT TURNS OUT, NEDJEMANKH'S

30:38.036 --> 30:39.270
COFFIN HAD BEEN STOLEN DURING

30:39.337 --> 30:41.439
THE EGYPTIAN UPRISING IN 2011.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.241
AND AS THE STORY UNRAVELED, IT

30:43.308 --> 30:44.576
BECAME CLEAR THE MET SHOULD'VE

30:44.642 --> 30:45.977
BEEN A LOT MORE SUSPICIOUS WHEN

30:46.044 --> 30:49.647
IT WAS OFFERED TO THEM.

30:49.714 --> 30:50.615
BECAUSE THE RED FLAGS INCLUDED

30:50.682 --> 30:51.849
THREE CONFLICTING OWNERSHIP

30:51.916 --> 30:53.318
HISTORIES, THE INVOLVEMENT OF

30:53.384 --> 30:54.552
KNOWN TRAFFICKERS, AND A FORGED

30:54.619 --> 30:55.587
EXPORT LICENSE THAT BORE THE

30:55.653 --> 30:57.055
STAMP "ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT"

30:57.121 --> 30:59.324
BEFORE THE COUNTRY USED THAT

30:59.390 --> 31:00.325
NAME.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.527
AND THAT'S TOO MANY RED FLAGS!

31:02.594 --> 31:04.562
IT'D BE LIKE IF MADAME TUSSAUD'S

31:04.629 --> 31:05.563
BOUGHT AND DISPLAYED A CLEARLY

31:05.630 --> 31:07.298
ALIVE JAMES SPADER.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.767
YOUR ONLY JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE

31:09.834 --> 31:10.401
THIS CELEBRITY WAS WAX, HOW'D

31:10.468 --> 31:12.770
YOU FUCK THIS UP SO BADLY?

31:12.837 --> 31:16.007
NOW, THE MET'S SINCE

31:16.074 --> 31:17.775
RELINQUISHED THE COFFIN AND

31:17.842 --> 31:19.444
APOLOGIZED TO EGYPT.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.313
BUT A MUSEUM'S APPROACH TO

31:22.380 --> 31:23.514
PROVENANCE RESEARCH CAN'T BE "DO

31:23.581 --> 31:24.549
NOTHING UNTIL KIM KARDASHIAN

31:24.616 --> 31:25.583
TAKES A PHOTOGRAPH IN FRONT OF

31:25.650 --> 31:26.718
ONE OF OUR OBJECTS AND WE'RE

31:26.784 --> 31:27.919
HUMILIATED ON THE INTERNATIONAL

31:27.986 --> 31:29.754
STAGE."

31:29.821 --> 31:32.457
THIS CAN'T BE HER RESPONSIBILITY

31:32.523 --> 31:34.125
SHE'S TOO BUSY

31:34.192 --> 31:37.595
REVOLUTIONIZING SHAPEWEAR!

31:37.662 --> 31:40.198
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING: IN THE

31:40.265 --> 31:41.299
LAST FIVE YEARS THE MET HAS HAD

31:41.366 --> 31:42.834
NO FEWER THAN NINE SEARCH

31:42.900 --> 31:45.336
WARRANTS EXECUTED ON IT,

31:45.403 --> 31:46.404
RESULTING IN 37 PIECES BEING

31:46.471 --> 31:47.605
SEIZED.

31:47.672 --> 31:48.973
AND NONE OF THIS IS A VICTIMLESS

31:49.040 --> 31:50.475
CRIME.

31:50.541 --> 31:52.844
BECAUSE THE TRAFFICKING OF

31:52.910 --> 31:54.279
LOOTED ANTIQUITIES HAS FINANCED

31:54.345 --> 31:55.847
SOME OF THE WORLD'S WORST

31:55.913 --> 31:56.881
ACTORS, FROM THE GENOCIDAL KHMER

31:56.948 --> 31:58.149
ROUGE IN CAMBODIA TO THE ISLAMIC

31:58.216 --> 32:00.385
STATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

32:00.451 --> 32:02.120
AND THE HARM ALSO EXTENDS TO THE

32:02.186 --> 32:04.289
PERSONAL LEVEL.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.623
BECAUSE, AGAIN, IF I CAN IMPRESS

32:05.690 --> 32:07.458
ONE THING ON YOU, IT'S THAT WHEN

32:07.525 --> 32:09.093
THESE OBJECTS END UP IN THE

32:09.160 --> 32:16.167
WEST, WE PUT THEM BEHIND GLASS

32:16.234 --> 32:17.068
AND CALL THEM ART.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.069
BUT IN THEIR

32:18.136 --> 32:18.870
HOME CONTEXTS, THEY CAN BE MUCH

32:18.936 --> 32:19.504
MORE.

32:19.570 --> 32:20.438
FOR INSTANCE, THIS STOLEN,

32:20.505 --> 32:21.306
SACRED STATUE WAS IN A DALLAS

32:21.372 --> 32:22.073
MUSEUM UNTIL MARCH OF LAST YEAR,

32:22.140 --> 32:22.940
AND WHEN IT WAS FINALLY RETURNED

32:23.007 --> 32:24.275
TO NEPAL, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT

32:24.342 --> 32:25.109
BACK INTO USE FOR RELIGIOUS

32:25.176 --> 32:27.578
WORSHIP.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.481
THERE'S JUST A LEVEL OF ABJECT

32:30.548 --> 32:31.783
CALLOUSNESS HERE-- WHICH, TO BE

32:31.849 --> 32:33.084
FAIR, SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE

32:33.151 --> 32:38.056
FINALLY COMING TO TERMS WITH.

32:38.122 --> 32:38.690
TAKE THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN

32:38.756 --> 32:38.990
IN

32:39.057 --> 32:39.524
SCOTLAND.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.325
IT RECENTLY BEGAN REASSESSING

32:40.391 --> 32:41.292
OBJECTS IN ITS COLLECTION, AND

32:41.359 --> 32:42.060
FACING THE GRIM REALITIES OF

32:42.126 --> 32:44.662
WHAT IT HAD BEEN HOLDING ONTO,

32:44.729 --> 32:46.431
LIKE THIS GLASS SPHERE.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.598
THE STORY BEHIND HOW IT GOT TO

32:47.665 --> 32:48.399
ABERDEEN IS BOTH FASCINATING AND

32:48.466 --> 32:50.802
HORRIFYING.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.537
THIS HINDU HOLY MAN HAD BEEN

32:52.603 --> 32:54.539
CHALLENGED TO HOLD THE GLASS

32:54.605 --> 32:55.907
SPHERE FOR 12 YEARS IN ORDER TO

32:55.973 --> 32:58.710
OBTAIN A BENEFICIAL AFTERLIFE.

32:58.776 --> 33:00.511
HE ONLY MANAGED EIGHT.

33:00.578 --> 33:02.480
SUBSEQUENTLY, WE DISCOVERED

33:02.547 --> 33:05.049
THAT IN THE ANATOMICAL

33:05.116 --> 33:05.683
COLLECTION OF HUMAN SKULLS, WE

33:05.750 --> 33:09.387
HAVE HIS SKULL.

33:09.454 --> 33:09.854
>>WOW.

33:09.921 --> 33:10.755
IS THAT HIS HEAD?

33:10.822 --> 33:11.489
THAT IS, YEAH.

33:11.556 --> 33:12.223
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

33:12.290 --> 33:12.890
GOSH.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.258
THAT'S HIM.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.228
AMAZING AND AWFUL AT THE SAME

33:17.295 --> 33:18.963
TIME, ISN'T IT?

33:19.030 --> 33:19.964
THEY'RE CREMATED, AREN'T THEY,

33:20.031 --> 33:20.765
HINDUS?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.367
AND HE HASN'T BEEN CREMATED.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.101
THAT'S PROFOUNDLY OFFENSIVE,

33:23.167 --> 33:24.402
ISN'T IT?

33:24.469 --> 33:26.471
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE 21ST

33:26.537 --> 33:27.772
CENTURY AND WE STILL HAVEN'T PUT

33:27.839 --> 33:28.773
THIS PERSON TO REST.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.440
NO.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.541
NO.

33:30.608 --> 33:31.242
GOD, THAT'S TERRIBLE, ISN'T

33:31.309 --> 33:32.910
IT?

33:32.977 --> 33:34.412
YES, IT IS FOR ABOUT A

33:34.479 --> 33:35.880
HUNDRED REASONS.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.383
BECAUSE A HEAD IN A BOX IS LESS

33:38.449 --> 33:40.551
SOMETHING YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND

33:40.618 --> 33:41.753
AT AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION, AND

33:41.819 --> 33:44.021
MORE IN THE BASEMENT OF A SERIAL

33:44.088 --> 33:45.623
KILLER.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.158
AND THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF SO MUCH

33:47.225 --> 33:48.393
HERE-- THE FACT THAT, FOR SO

33:48.459 --> 33:49.827
LONG, NOT ONLY DID NO ONE SEE

33:49.894 --> 33:50.661
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT OBJECT

33:50.728 --> 33:52.397
TO THAT MAN, NO ONE SAW THAT MAN

33:52.463 --> 33:55.299
AS SIGNIFICANT, PERIOD.

33:55.366 --> 33:55.833
SO.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.268
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

33:57.335 --> 33:59.003
WELL, SOME INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE

33:59.070 --> 34:00.505
UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN HAVE BEEN

34:00.571 --> 34:02.106
TAKING THIS RECKONING SERIOUSLY.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.207
THEY'RE BEGINNING DISCUSSIONS

34:03.274 --> 34:04.675
WITH A LOCAL HINDU TEMPLE ABOUT

34:04.742 --> 34:05.910
WHAT TO DO WITH THAT MAN'S

34:05.977 --> 34:06.878
REMAINS.

34:06.944 --> 34:08.946
THEY ACTUALLY ALSO HAD A BENIN

34:09.013 --> 34:10.515
BRONZE, WHICH THEY REPATRIATED

34:10.581 --> 34:12.049
LATE LAST YEAR.

34:12.116 --> 34:13.518
WHICH IS GREAT.

34:13.584 --> 34:14.485
BUT TOO OFTEN, THE RECKONING

34:14.552 --> 34:17.088
ONLY GOES SO FAR.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.823
A FEW YEARS AGO, THE UK'S

34:18.890 --> 34:19.957
NATIONAL ARMY MUSEUM RETURNED TO

34:20.024 --> 34:21.459
ETHIOPIA A STOLEN LOCK OF HAIR

34:21.526 --> 34:22.493
BELONGING TO AN ETHIOPIAN

34:22.560 --> 34:24.362
EMPEROR, BUT TOOK PAINS TO POINT

34:24.429 --> 34:26.497
OUT THAT IT WAS "DEFINITELY NOT

34:26.564 --> 34:30.067
A PRECEDENT."

34:30.134 --> 34:32.103
THE FACT IS, MUSEUMS

34:32.170 --> 34:34.272
SHOULD BE GETTING ASKED HARD

34:34.338 --> 34:36.641
QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF

34:36.707 --> 34:37.742
BOTH THEIR ACQUISITION PROCESS

34:37.809 --> 34:39.177
AND THEIR COLLECTIONS, AS PART

34:39.243 --> 34:41.112
OF A LONG-OVERDUE CONVERSATION

34:41.179 --> 34:43.147
ABOUT WHERE THEIR ITEMS CAME

34:43.214 --> 34:45.249
FROM, AND WHETHER ANYONE WANTS

34:45.316 --> 34:45.516
THEM BACK.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.952
SOME COUNTRIES MIGHT EVEN BE

34:48.019 --> 34:48.986
WILLING TO LOAN ITEMS OUT TO

34:49.053 --> 34:49.787
MUSEUMS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT

34:49.854 --> 34:51.622
WITH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

34:51.689 --> 34:54.025
WHO ACTUALLY OWNS THEM.

34:54.091 --> 34:55.293
THE POINT IS, THAT CONVERSATION

34:55.359 --> 34:56.394
SHOULD BE LED BY THE GROUPS

34:56.461 --> 34:57.094
THOSE ITEMS ORIGINALLY BELONGED

34:57.161 --> 34:59.230
TO.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.631
BECAUSE WHILE OBVIOUSLY, MUSEUMS

35:00.698 --> 35:02.133
SHOULDN'T BE VIOLATING THE LAW,

35:02.200 --> 35:03.167
THEY SHOULDN'T BE VIOLATING

35:03.234 --> 35:07.972
BASIC MORAL DECENCY, EITHER.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.273
THERE IS SO MUCH WE NEED TO DO

35:09.340 --> 35:11.142
TO RECKON WITH THE HARMS, PAST

35:11.209 --> 35:12.143
AND PRESENT, OF COLONIALISM.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.110
BUT THIS SHOULD BE THE EASY

35:13.177 --> 35:16.280
PART.

35:16.347 --> 35:17.415
AND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE

35:17.482 --> 35:18.249
GENUINELY ENGAGE IN THAT

35:18.316 --> 35:21.786
RECKONING, I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A

35:21.853 --> 35:25.923
POTENTIAL PLAN B.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.265

35:36.000 --> 35:36.801
WORLD DEVOTED TO PROVIDING

35:36.868 --> 35:38.302
RECOURSE TO NATIONS WHO HAVE

35:38.369 --> 35:40.605
BEEN PLUNDERED OF THEIR GREATEST

35:40.671 --> 35:42.540
TREASURES THROUGHOUT HISTORY BY

35:42.607 --> 35:43.908
COLONIAL DICK HEADS.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.344
THIS IS A COLLECTION ALL ABOUT

35:46.410 --> 35:47.545
DISCONNECTING PEOPLE,

35:47.612 --> 35:48.312
SPECIFICALLY DISCONNECTING

35:48.379 --> 35:48.913
WESTERN COUNTRIES FROM THEIR

35:48.980 --> 35:51.482

35:51.549 --> 35:54.318

35:54.385 --> 35:56.153
WELCOME TO OUR AFRICA WING, THIS

35:56.220 --> 35:59.023
IS WHERE THERE SHOULD BE

35:59.090 --> 36:00.224
BRONZES, THE SPECTACULAR TABLETS

36:00.291 --> 36:01.292

36:01.359 --> 36:04.462
STORY OF THE GLORIOUS KINGDOM.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.329
BUT THEY WERE PUT IN THE BACK,

36:05.396 --> 36:08.099
SHAKEN AND DUMPED OUT OVER

36:08.165 --> 36:09.400
EUROPE LOOK A BUNCH OF SCRABBLE

36:09.467 --> 36:10.768
LETTERS SO UNTIL WE GET THEM

36:10.835 --> 36:12.303

36:12.370 --> 36:16.707
OF THE STONEHENGE ARCHES!

36:25.316 --> 36:27.285

36:27.351 --> 36:28.853
WE WON'T THINK ABOUT RETURNING

36:28.920 --> 36:30.555
IT AND STILL YOU START CARING

36:30.621 --> 36:33.291
ABOUT WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.358
HONESTLY I DON'T LIKE IT, I

36:34.425 --> 36:38.663
THINK THE STONE HEDGE SUCKS

36:38.729 --> 36:40.031
I DON'T WANT TO RETURN THEM TO

36:40.097 --> 36:41.065
SPITE YOU.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.034
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

36:43.100 --> 36:43.467
I AM.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.469
AT LATIN AMERICA WE WANTED TO

36:45.536 --> 36:47.872
FEATURE A COLLECTION OF GORGEOUS

36:47.939 --> 36:48.839
ANCIENT INDIGENOUS PERUVIAN

36:53.044 --> 36:55.646
LIBERTY BELL!

36:55.713 --> 36:57.848

36:57.915 --> 36:59.483
FUCKING BELL.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.918

37:02.386 --> 37:03.821

37:58.142 --> 38:01.912
COLLEGE WALL IN OUR DORM ROOM.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.648
THE STORY OF ITS OWNERSHIP CAN

38:03.714 --> 38:06.283
BE JUST AS INTERESTING AS THE

38:06.350 --> 38:07.785
ART ITSELF, WHO OWNED IT, WHO

38:07.852 --> 38:09.654
LOVED US, WHO YELLED STOP AS WE

38:12.957 --> 38:13.991
DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

38:14.058 --> 38:35.813

38:35.880 --> 38:36.414
IF YOU COME WITH ME, OUR LAST

38:36.480 --> 38:37.048
STOP IS WHERE THE REAL TREASURES

38:50.461 --> 38:51.662

38:51.729 --> 38:53.197
NEARLY LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT TO

38:53.264 --> 38:55.032
BE OKAY AND I SAY OH, YEAH?

38:55.099 --> 38:56.500
HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO BE DEAD

38:56.567 --> 38:58.602
FOR IT TO BE OKAY?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.005

39:01.072 --> 39:04.075

39:04.141 --> 39:04.842
OF HIS BODY SWEATING IN A

39:04.909 --> 39:09.013
MUSEUMS HOT STORAGE.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.648

39:10.715 --> 39:12.416
COUNTRIES WHO OWN THIS STUFF,

39:12.483 --> 39:12.683
ENJOY IT.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.653

39:19.457 --> 39:20.691

I KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT SOME OF

39:21.392 --> 39:22.660
THIS STUFF BACK AND WE WOULD

39:22.727 --> 39:23.761
LOVE TO GIVE IT BACK TO YOU BUT

39:23.828 --> 39:25.229
IF WE GIVE IT TO YOU EVERYONE

39:25.296 --> 39:26.764
ELSE IS GOING TO LINE UP AND

39:26.831 --> 39:29.433
SUDDENLY THIS WHOLE PLACE IS

39:29.500 --> 39:29.633
EMPTY.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.435
SO THE ANSWER IS NO.

39:31.502 --> 39:37.141
IT'S ALL OURS FOREVER.
