WEBVTT

01:18.954 --> 01:20.410
Follow me.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.806
Come on, you...

01:49.901 --> 01:51.687
Can't get a shot.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.871
Come on.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.921
Come on... come on.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.119
There's a storm right now,
160 miles per hour.

02:45.749 --> 02:49.116
And we still have gusts around 190.

02:49.211 --> 02:53.124
So this area, this territory,
is certainly very much in danger.

02:54.549 --> 02:58.292
Fifteen inches of rainfall possible
across parts of Puerto Rico.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.551
And life-threatening mudslides
and really more flash flooding.

03:04.643 --> 03:08.306
This is where we will see
the storm surge, storm winds.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.351
There will certainly be damage.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.241
Jj

04:08.623 --> 04:12.332
The entire territory
will be absolutely under the control

04:12.419 --> 04:15.832
of this category 4,
maybe category 5 storm.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.252
You got something we want.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.012
- Walk normal. Walk normal.
- Right.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.270
If you say anything, I'll shoot you
and the person next to you.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.106
How can I help you?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.777
Thank you.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.839
He... he wouldn't even tell me his hame.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.654
It was... it was arranged
through a third party.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.260
- I don't know anything...
- Calm down, calm down. It's okay.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.558
What's the address?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.851
Here's Puerto Rico:

05:17.943 --> 05:20.810
3.5 million Americans live there.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.611
And here it comes, right along the shore.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.110
But San Juan is still going to have winds

05:26.201 --> 05:28.943
of 130 to 140 miles an hour.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.823
There will be weeks without power.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.996
There may be weeks without water.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.657
- I need to sit.
- You're fine.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.242
I need... please, I need to...

05:37.337 --> 05:39.373
John. John.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.999
Jj

05:50.308 --> 05:52.924
- Let's go.
- Where's babie?

05:53.019 --> 05:56.762
The old prune panicked.
Babie was aborted.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.347
Come on. Let's go.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.372
Jj

08:08.530 --> 08:11.146
Whoo.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.890
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.107
Cardillo, I need the keys
to the prisoner holding cell.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.150
- Yes, sir. There you go.
- Thanks.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.862
Mom make bail?

08:54.909 --> 08:57.901
- Cardillo!
- Wow. Yeah?

08:57.996 --> 09:00.237
This is officer pena.
She'll be assisting with the evac.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.743
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.540
The two of you will take the Van.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.913
You'll be scouring
every last motherfucking inch

09:07.005 --> 09:08.541
- for anybody that's left.
- Buyt...

09:08.631 --> 09:10.484
You find 'em, you take 'em
to the safety shelter.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.840
- I'm really looking forward to...
- That's not my job.

09:12.927 --> 09:16.419
It is today.
Get your ass out there.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.754
Good luck.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.190
Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.612
Fuck.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.784
Hey.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.796
We're gonna get you those burgers, huh?

09:58.556 --> 10:02.640
Hey, man. Do you mind leaving some
for the rest of us?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.644
- Excuse me?
- You took all the meat.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.311
Oh, god.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.357
Come on, man.
Need just some meat for my kid.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.406
What do you wanna do, man, huh?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.575
You wanna fight me in front of your kid?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.825
Excuse me. Excuse me!

10:25.834 --> 10:29.247
That man just grabbed a pack of ground
beef right out of my son's hand.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.481
What? What are you talking about?

10:30.505 --> 10:33.838
What?

10:33.925 --> 10:37.292
Sir, I'm gonna have to take your cart
and ask you to leave.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.930
Whoa, whoa! Stop it!

11:01.536 --> 11:02.696
Any advice?

11:04.581 --> 11:06.037
About?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.456
This precinct. The residents.

11:10.086 --> 11:14.546
Oh. Don't trust 'em, but...
That applies everywhere.

11:14.632 --> 11:19.251
Not just the places, where, um,
don't speak the fucking language.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.136
Oh, yeah?

11:22.223 --> 11:25.966
Well, uh, I'm actually trying
to transfer into this house.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.973
Or rio piedras, I don't know.
Something with more action.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.430
- Yeah.
- It's slow as hell up in zone two.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.608
That's why I volunteered today.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.439
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.076
- So how are we gonna play this?
- Play what?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.289
What if people refuse to leave?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.492
Well, then they die
horrible fucking deaths.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.371
But this good news is,
is it ain't our fault.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.749
We're not picking anybody up.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.215
Yeah, but, uh, it. Cunningham
said that we have to...

12:06.309 --> 12:10.348
Okay, okay, okay. Let's just say
that we go out and we grab a guy, right?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.303
He doesn't wanna leave.

12:12.398 --> 12:17.017
He wants your name, he wants your badge
number to file a complaint.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.227
Yeah, let him. I'm doing my job.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.732
Oh, like that matters?

12:20.823 --> 12:24.407
You want a transfer or a promotion,

12:24.494 --> 12:27.861
and the bosses, they're gonna
look at your record, right?

12:27.956 --> 12:30.197
Oh, see you got a complaint.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.532
Could be bullshit. Doesn't matter.

12:32.627 --> 12:36.119
You wash your hands at the sink
and you get splash back,

12:36.214 --> 12:38.375
it still looks like you pissed yourself.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.004
Okay. So we're doing nothing?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.631
That's the idea.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.712
Maybe we'll get some donuts later.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.643
10-32, Plaza del mercado
de rio piedras.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.939
Don't.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.654
Show sector Adam-boy-Charlie responding.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.198
All right.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.624
You insist.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.089
Alrighty then.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.673
What happened?

13:33.396 --> 13:36.058
Um, he was trying
to clear out the meat section,

13:36.149 --> 13:37.459
and he got into a fight with a customer.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.817
Mm... clear out the meat section.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.360
What, the entire section?

13:43.448 --> 13:46.611
Is there a law against
how much meat I can buy?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.534
Sure isn't, but how much meat
were you trying to buy?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.201
Just for the record.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.532
- A hundred pounds.
- Oh, wow.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.582
- Quite the party.
- Yeah, that's a lot of meat.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.910
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.417
Uh, where's the victim?

14:06.554 --> 14:09.341
Guy left. Didn't wanna press charges.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.048
All he wanted was to make hamburgers
for his little kid.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.496
- Well, that's adorable.
- See, the guy didn't wanna press charges.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.511
Y'all gotta let me go, right?

14:16.606 --> 14:21.225
Yeah, well, you tell me what you need
all that meat for, I'll consider it.

14:28.910 --> 14:29.910
Huh...

14:31.245 --> 14:34.737
That... is a little suspicious. Let's go.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.451
Let's go.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.625
Y'all arresting me?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.433
No. We're putting you on a bus
to a shelter.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.124
- Y'all can't do that.
- No?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.676
- I'm pretty sure we can.
- I have to stop past my place.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.550
- Yeah?
- Yo, officer, I'm being serious.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.223
- This is very important.
- No.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.344
Are you just gonna
give me one-word answers?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.144
- Maybe.
- All right. Let's go.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.722
- You know what? Fuck you.
- Oh, no.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.897
- Fuck you, too.
- Oh, yeah?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.144
- Fuck you.
- You walk...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.648
Whoa! That escalated quickly.

15:07.323 --> 15:11.066
Yo, officer, I got some people at my place
that are refusing to leave.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.240
Yeah, who?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.569
Well, there's this old guy
who never leaves.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.950
And a cop. One of you guys.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.827
How do you know they don't wanna leave?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.749
Well, the old guy, he never leaves.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.397
And the cop was just bragging
about how he wasn't going anywhere.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.369
Look, I have a pet.
That's why I'm here at the supermarket.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.008
- You have a pet?
- Yeah.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.007
- What kind of pet?
- A hungry one.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.931
- Uh-huh. What's its name?
- Her name is Janet.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.383
Yeah, I don't... I don't like that.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.639
Well, Janet doesn't like cops.
Look, guys...

15:42.817 --> 15:46.025
Y'all can arrest me,
do whatever the hell you wanna do.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.774
But I need to feed her
and get her some water before the storm.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.064
Please.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.447
You said there's a cop that won't leave?

15:55.538 --> 15:56.778
Yeah.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.706
All right. Let's go feed your fuckin' cat.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.013
That the super?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.389
Yeah.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.104
Yeah, that's him.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.903
- What's your name?
- Luillo.

16:34.994 --> 16:35.994
All right, Louie Joe.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.990
This guy says you got residents
that are refusing to evacuate.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.081
That's right.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.873
He said you got a retired cop
and an old guy.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.168
- Old guy in 15e.
- And the cop?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.712
Barrett, 53b.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.381
All right, let's grab Barrett,

16:51.469 --> 16:53.750
and then we'll swing back down
and grab the old guy, okay?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.510
- Okay.
- You gonna let me feed Janet?

16:55.598 --> 16:58.089
- What apartment number you in?
- 33b.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.015
- Is that true?
- Yes.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.539
All right, do it quick.
We'll grab you in five minutes, all right?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.428
Fine.

17:11.571 --> 17:14.188
Does that say "out of order?”

17:14.282 --> 17:16.194
What is that? I

17:16.285 --> 17:17.991
- si.
- Si sj

17:18.079 --> 17:19.239
perfect.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.616
All right.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.916
You know, you should learn some Spanish.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're in Puerto Rico.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.583
- Yeah.
- That's how we say it. Puerto Rico.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.558
Can you get them to fuck off?

17:50.653 --> 17:52.609
We're evacuating the building.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.023
We're evacuating the building.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.654
Thank god. I need your help.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.530
Look, even the pd's taking this seriously.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.452
Yeah, current pd's full of pussies

18:02.540 --> 18:04.747
who care more about
liability and politics.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.194
I'm staying here. I'm not leaving.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.913
I'm not going anywhere.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.792
You gonna take that risk?

18:12.883 --> 18:17.968
Well, hurricane Irene
started like this, came to nothing.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.046
She wants to take me to centro medico.

18:20.141 --> 18:23.053
That third-rate shithole.
I mean, that's death depot.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.884
We used to take the od cases there.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.015
I don't recall seeing any
of them ever again.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.815
Well, unfortunately, sir,
it's either that or the evac bus.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.269
Excuse me, senorita.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.282
You all right there?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.322
You worked in rio piedras?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.401
Yeah, I used to run that house.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.820
Do I know you?

18:44.915 --> 18:45.915
I know you.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.950
'Cause I just put in a transfer there.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.208
Is that right?
Where do I know you from?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.458
I know you.

18:58.721 --> 19:03.431
- I know you from someplace.
- Uh... from this evac.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.758
- Sir, can we get your stuff?
- Yeah, let's get going.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.138
You're cardillo.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.480
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, cardillo. You had that
thing about a year ago, right?

19:12.860 --> 19:15.067
Yeah? How'd it go down?

19:18.574 --> 19:21.407
It got me down here.
Don't worry about it.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.242
I'm not worried about it.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.156
They ever catch the guy
that made the call?

19:31.796 --> 19:34.629
- Eventually, yeah.
- Yeah? Did you beat his ass?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.330
- Dad...
- Did I what?

19:36.425 --> 19:37.505
Did you beat his ass?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.801
Hey, back in my day,
we had this moron called Willie bosket.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.925
He used to call the stationhouse
to report a rape or a robbery.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.804
We'd all rush down there, the guy'd be on
the roof with a bb gun, sniping us.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.374
About the third time round,
we caught him and broke a few fingers.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.481
- Nice, dad. That's real nice.
- Hey, it stopped him. Okay?

19:53.567 --> 19:57.480
- Yep.
- Hey, the other cop, the partner.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.152
That was your girl, right?

20:07.248 --> 20:10.365
Troy, honey, uh, I think
I like my odds better here.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.041
I'm a stubborn asshole,
she takes after me.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.856
I'm standing right here,
you know what I mean?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.962
Hey, what do you think
I got fuckin' Alzheimer's...

20:17.049 --> 20:20.212
It's a category 5 fuckin' hurricane goin'
on outside, you forgot about that.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.338
You think it's a five already?

20:22.430 --> 20:25.092
Hey, lay it out for me.
How did it go down?

20:25.182 --> 20:26.638
Tell me.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.096
All right, I'm gonna go
grab the other old guy.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.143
- Sir, I highly advise...
- Other old guy?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.334
- That you go with your daughter.
- Yes, thank you.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.974
- Or in this case, your guardian.
- Oh, a fuckin' comedian, yeah.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.775
And it's only out of respect for the badge

20:38.863 --> 20:41.855
that you're not on a 5150 hold,
face down on the ground,

20:41.949 --> 20:43.385
- hog-tied and fuckin' cuffed...
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

20:43.409 --> 20:44.615
What, you gonna shoot me, too?

20:44.702 --> 20:46.784
Okay, you hear me, you crazy old fuck?!

20:46.871 --> 20:49.032
- Shut the fuck up!
- You cop-killing cocksucker!

20:50.332 --> 20:51.788
- Hey!
- Where you goin'?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.036
- Where you goin'?
- You stay!

20:53.127 --> 20:55.355
Yeah, and don't go with that guy.
Not without a bulletproof vest.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.915
Honestly, you are so fuckin' stubborn.

21:00.551 --> 21:01.836
This guy's your fuckin' partner?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.051
Yep.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.880
You're a very brave girl.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.465
Hey, hey! What are you...

21:09.560 --> 21:12.176
What are you doing?
You're just gonna leave?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.513
Your dad doesn't wanna leave, ma'am.
I can't force him.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.103
Isn't that what you're here for?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.339
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to carry him down?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.900
Hey, you know what,
I don't care what you do.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.107
He needs his dialysis machine.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.410
Once the storm knocks
the power out in this building,

21:29.497 --> 21:32.660
nothing's gonna work.
No machine is gonna work.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.911
I have a bed for him
reserved at the hospital,

21:35.002 --> 21:37.288
but if we don't get there soon,
we lose it.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.789
You really a doctor?

21:43.427 --> 21:45.839
No, I just like wearing pajamas all day.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.964
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is to go back in there with me

21:50.059 --> 21:52.019
and help me get him the fuck out
of this building.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.142
Well, officer pena's with him, okay?
She'll take him down.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.896
He doesn't exactly respond
to female authority.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.655
All right.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.156
You know this old guy, right?

22:15.376 --> 22:17.742
Yeah, I've seen him around.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.749
Do me a favor, and help me with him.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.276
And once we get him out,
we'll come back up,

22:23.300 --> 22:25.040
and we'll grab your father. Okay?

22:29.390 --> 22:31.051
All right. Come on.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.053
Around the corner to the left.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.648
Down there. Straight ahead.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.094
This guy always
have this much security?

22:49.118 --> 22:51.279
Not that I recall. Sir?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.985
Hello, sir, it's Troy Barrett.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.490
You know my father, ray.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.622
Hello, sir.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.290
What can I help you with?

23:02.381 --> 23:03.791
You need to come with us, sir.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.589
No. I cannot leave.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.507
You're gonna be
flooded out here if you stay,

23:07.595 --> 23:09.460
you're on the first floor.
It's too dangerous.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.467
Has your father left?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.974
We're gonna evacuate him
right after you.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.676
Cardillo to pena.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.499
The sooner you come with me,
we're gonna get him,

23:19.523 --> 23:20.792
we're gonna get everyone safe
out of the building.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.272
Pena, are you there?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.029
Cardillo, you copy?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.360
Crickets, huh?

23:35.372 --> 23:37.158
All your comms are down in this shit.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.535
Hey, listen, sweetheart.
You don't need to babysit me, okay.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.044
So you ran rio piedras, huh?

23:52.306 --> 23:54.592
Yeah, you're not leaving. Okay.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.719
Okay, you don't take a hint, do ya?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.971
I'll be clearer.
You can go now. Thank you. It's...

23:59.063 --> 24:01.019
- So...
- I'm good, thank you.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.724
I'm trying to transfer into that house,
but it's being held up.

24:04.818 --> 24:10.063
So... you think you can put in...
A word for me?

24:16.872 --> 24:19.909
- I'm sorry.
- Pefia, do you copy?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.709
I know it feels safer to stay here,
but we gotta get to higher ground.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.607
You cannot park there!
Keep it moving!

24:25.631 --> 24:29.249
I'm safer here. I'm not leaving.
I cannot leave my home.

24:29.343 --> 24:34.087
Hey! Hey! You cannot park there.

24:36.767 --> 24:40.430
Keep it moving! Get out!

24:41.480 --> 24:44.472
You cannot park there!

24:44.566 --> 24:45.976
I'll take care of this.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.565
What is it with these stubborn bastards
in this building?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.820
- You have to come with us.
- I'm sorry, I'm not going.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.532
- Officer!
- Hold on just a second.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.908
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.912
- So you can go.
- No, this is an evacuation.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.875
It is closed.
They are closing the roads.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.299
Please, keep going. Come on, man.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.674
Take it easy. Take it easy...

25:15.764 --> 25:18.972
Jj

25:29.695 --> 25:31.856
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go now!

25:31.947 --> 25:33.483
- Why?
- We've gotta go right now.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.782
Come on! Come on!

25:36.869 --> 25:38.905
Right now!

25:40.372 --> 25:43.284
Okay. Come here.
Come on! Quick, quick!

25:44.293 --> 25:46.124
Ernesto...

25:55.596 --> 25:57.257
It's a fucking cop!

25:59.475 --> 26:00.555
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.970
You might hit the old man.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.139
Migs, you need to catch up
to them. Top floor.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.318
- Who the hell were those guys?
- I have no idea.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.645
We have to get back to my dad.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.402
No, it's too far. We won't make it.
They'll see us.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.075
- Well, then where are we going?
- Up.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.744
Come... come on. Come on.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.708
What are we gonna do
about the fucking cop?

26:28.796 --> 26:31.003
Don't get excited. They're trapped.

26:31.090 --> 26:35.049
Those stairs only lead up
and the only exit is on this floor.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.842
Dillon, start your way on top
and work your way down.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.842
Pride, Ernesto,
you two guard the front door.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.642
Nobody gets in. Nobody gets out.
Okay? Go.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.942
Let's go.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.701
Janet! I'm sorry, baby. I'm coming.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.528
I got caught up in the supermarket.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.414
All right. Here we go.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.208
I know, I know, I know, I know.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.626
Griffin!
Open the door, right now!

27:15.717 --> 27:16.957
Open the door.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.585
I'll meet you downstairs.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.600
Open the door, Griffin.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.183
Griffin, open the door!
You gotta let us in, right now.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.727
Fuck that!

27:28.814 --> 27:30.270
How I know you're not setting me up?

27:33.318 --> 27:34.598
Back, back, back...

27:34.653 --> 27:37.315
Griffin, you think this is a trap?
I let you go earlier.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.569
Listen, I've got Troy
and your downstairs neighbor here.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.719
If you don't let us in right now,

27:41.743 --> 27:44.576
we are gonna get our
motherfuckin' heads blown off!

27:44.663 --> 27:47.120
Open the door!

27:48.125 --> 27:49.831
Open the door.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.374
Shit.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.004
We on the same side?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.831
Hey, do me a favor, all right?

27:57.926 --> 28:00.542
Put your ear to the door.
I'm gonna tell you something.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.219
- Put your ear to the door!
- My ear's to the goddamn door!

28:04.266 --> 28:06.006
Okay.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.017
Open the fucking door!

28:12.274 --> 28:13.274
Okay.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.152
Central, 10-13.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.991
- Shots fired. Okay.
- Who's killing who?

28:24.077 --> 28:26.681
- Just quiet down. Be quiet.
- No, you quiet down! You in my house.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.932
Shots fired at...
What's the address here?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.038
- Six... sixty-five...
- Six-five-eight.

28:30.125 --> 28:34.710
- Six-five-eight... miramar.
- Six-five-eight miramar.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.003
Fuck! Landline.
I need a landline.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.526
- Do you have a landline?
- Sorry, man.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.694
I didn't get the fuckin' bundle.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.446
- Who the fuck's got a landline, man?
- Oh, fuck.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.553
You know, you guys bust into my place
without any consideration.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.950
I don't give a fuck who shot who.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.854
Super Louie Joe...

28:47.935 --> 28:49.721
Well, he's super fucking dead, okay?

28:54.358 --> 28:55.939
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

28:58.237 --> 28:59.277
Give me that bowl of food!

29:00.781 --> 29:03.318
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

29:03.408 --> 29:05.148
- What food?
- Give me the bowl of food!

29:05.244 --> 29:06.950
- What?
- Give me the bowl of food!

29:12.417 --> 29:13.782
Help!

29:18.715 --> 29:21.047
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- What?

29:21.134 --> 29:23.341
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot?

29:23.428 --> 29:26.010
Just bring me that bowl of food.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.222
- What?
- Bring me the bowl of food!

29:29.309 --> 29:31.766
It's right behind you.
Bring me the bowl of food.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.977
Okay...

29:37.901 --> 29:39.437
The whole thing?

29:41.989 --> 29:43.479
Oh, my god.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.442
What the fuck?

29:51.415 --> 29:52.951
Stop, stop...

29:53.041 --> 29:56.408
- What?
- Take off your uniform.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.368
Take off my fucking uniform?

29:58.463 --> 30:01.375
Yeah. She hates cops. I trained her.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.708
If you don't want her to bite
your fuckin' ass, take your uniform off.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.265
Okay. Tell me your story.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.047
- What do you mean? What kind of story?
- A Disney story. What do you think?

30:23.071 --> 30:25.778
I want your story.
Like your best collar.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.152
If you want a rec,
you gotta gimme something to work with.

30:30.746 --> 30:35.490
There was a warrant out on a murder
suspect about five months back.

30:35.584 --> 30:39.293
I'm on patrol driving
by the burger king off avenida ashford.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.665
And I see a guy in the parking lot.

30:41.757 --> 30:45.750
Six-two, 160, long hair.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.334
We park and approach.

30:47.429 --> 30:51.013
But as I'm getting closer,
I realize it's not the guy.

31:00.067 --> 31:02.183
Slow. Nothing too quick.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.483
Oh, my god.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.062
All right.
Now you gonna grab my hand.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.192
All right.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.899
And when I say,
pull me out as fast as you can.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.279
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.737
- All right.
- Okay, here we go. Okay.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.911
Go!

31:17.084 --> 31:18.924
Close the door!
Close the door! Close the door!

31:21.838 --> 31:23.453
What the fuck is that?!

31:23.548 --> 31:26.085
Oh, shit.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.461
- I lost them.
- You lost them?

31:30.555 --> 31:32.200
They gotta be somewhere else
in the building.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.966
- There's no other way out.
- No. Shut the fuck up.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.516
All right? No excuses!

31:39.064 --> 31:41.931
Okay? Go find them. Now, go!

31:59.084 --> 32:01.370
Griffin, that's your fucking pet?

32:01.461 --> 32:04.999
You got a killing machine
for a fucking service animal.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.671
Okay, we got a problem.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.874
What kinda bedside manner talk is this?

32:08.969 --> 32:10.960
"We got a problem?”
you don't wanna ease me in?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.840
I could really use a saw.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.095
Yeah, this would be a great point
for an amputee.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.427
- No, you're not cutting my leg off!
- We don't have time to ease you in.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.137
What do you need?

32:22.232 --> 32:24.268
Uh, a splint to secure the femur.

32:24.359 --> 32:28.272
Antiseptic, penicillin, gauze, stitches.

32:28.363 --> 32:32.982
- I know a doctor.
- Congratulations.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.408
He's here in the building.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.487
- Dr. berman.
- Yeah, what apartment? Where?

32:38.582 --> 32:42.871
- It's, uh... 63b.
- Shit...

32:44.296 --> 32:46.378
All right, I'll go get that stuff.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.192
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, you gotta stay here with him.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.194
No, I'll come with you.
The sooner we take care of this,

32:50.218 --> 32:51.778
the sooner I can get back to my father.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.463
- All right.
- Hey, come over here. Come here.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.047
Come, I need your help.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.678
I need you to take both your hands

32:58.768 --> 33:01.134
and apply pressure
to this wound, okay? Hard.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.476
Talk to him, keep him awake.
It's just as important

33:05.567 --> 33:07.211
as applying pressure
to the wound. You got it?

33:07.235 --> 33:08.475
- Of course.
- Okay.

33:09.905 --> 33:10.905
- Griffin...
- Hm?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.980
There any back stairs?
Alternate routes up?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.814
There's only one set of stairs.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.117
And the elevator,
but the elevator's out.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.614
Yeah, of course it is.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.117
But there's another way.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.664
Scaffolding.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.036
Scaffolding.

33:32.636 --> 33:37.300
So, oh, yeah. The guy we're looking for
has tats and this guy's clean.

33:37.390 --> 33:42.305
But something was off. He looks nervous.

33:42.395 --> 33:45.808
My radar starts going off,
and that's when I see it.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.515
What?

33:48.610 --> 33:52.194
A giant bulge sticking out of his...

33:52.280 --> 33:55.943
- You know...
- What, his crotch? What?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.116
No, his ass.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.955
I see the top of a plastic baggie
sticking out of the top of his pants.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.282
I ask him what it is, he goes nuts.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.993
We cuff him, take him back
to the stationhouse,

34:08.088 --> 34:13.503
and when we strip search him,
we find 93 baggies of crack cocaine.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.293
Biggest narcotics collar that month.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.388
- Biggest.
- Wow.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.592
So what you're telling me
is you stumble onto a narcotics collar,

34:23.687 --> 34:27.350
all because some moron had a family-sized
baggie sticking out of his ass?

34:28.567 --> 34:29.931
That's your best collar?

34:31.402 --> 34:33.359
You didn't even have probable cause.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.781
- Never mind.
- No, you know, I'm just saying.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.139
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They should be done by now.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.405
I'm... I'm gonna go check on them.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.331
- Yeah...
- Yeah, you can do...

34:47.418 --> 34:49.375
You can do, you know, whatever.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.043
I'm such an asshole.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.254
- You got it?
- Yeah.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.682
So, two flights up and three units over.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.813
Yeah. Are you a good shot?

35:14.904 --> 35:17.646
- Yeah, why?
- Do me a favor.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.902
If I fall, shoot me.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.235
I don't wanna wait four-and-a-half hours
to die of a brain hemorrhage.

35:23.330 --> 35:24.695
Yeah, what if I fall?

35:24.789 --> 35:27.201
You're hard-headed. You'll survive.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.043
- Ready?
- Blow it.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.279
Watch it, sweetheart.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.908
Take your hand off your gun, slowly.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.080
Hands in the air.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.576
Where are they?

36:14.464 --> 36:15.795
Where are who?

36:15.882 --> 36:17.793
Your partner and the old man.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.346
- Follow me. I'll show you.
- Go.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.725
Better not be fucking with me.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.684
Come on.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.564
Hey! You mind pointing
that gun somewhere else?

36:39.656 --> 36:40.941
Hey, shut the fuck up.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.983
Is this it?

36:45.078 --> 36:46.193
This is it.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.492
You go first.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.197
If this is a fucking ambush,

36:51.292 --> 36:53.283
I swear to god, I will fucking kill you.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.413
Hey, asshole!

37:00.218 --> 37:03.506
Oh, yeah. Come on, now
help me drag him inside.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.087
He's a heavy motherfucker.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.047
Yeah, come on. Come on, buddy.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.350
Boss!

37:32.417 --> 37:34.999
Get down there.
I'll go check on Chaz. Go.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.712
Don't worry.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.759
She won't break through.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.138
What's your name?

37:54.522 --> 37:57.810
- Paul.
- Paul...

37:59.944 --> 38:03.107
What's the accent? German?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.401
- German, yes.
- Mm-hm.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.150
I'm Jason.

38:09.245 --> 38:13.204
I would offer to shake your hand, but I
really need you to keep pushing down.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.872
Of course.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.122
Give me the gun.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.545
Jj

39:29.784 --> 39:32.241
Oh, shit.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.118
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.083
They're on the fourth floor, heading up.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.384
- Where's Ernesto?
- He's dead.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.553
Bigger splits for the rest of us.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.517
Ah... you recognize that name?

40:01.608 --> 40:05.351
Alexander Dillon. No. No, should I?

40:05.445 --> 40:08.653
You want to work the good cases,
you gotta know the players.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.566
- Who is he?
- He's part of a crew.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.025
He does high-end heist jobs...

40:14.120 --> 40:16.031
Jewelry, museums, armored trucks.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.748
The shot caller's
a real psycho piece of shit.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.042
Calls himself John the baptist.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.461
I got a buddy downtown,
a lieutenant I trained,

40:25.548 --> 40:27.504
he works the major crime zone three.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.299
He's been chasing these clowns
for a... for a month.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.216
You okay? Are you all right?

40:34.307 --> 40:37.891
Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor?
Get my pills.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.468
Oxy, oxy-whatever the fuck you call it.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.394
I can't pronounce it.
Uh, not that room.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.973
The next door down.
That's my wife's art studio.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.854
The next door down is the bathroom.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.775
So did you read the paper?

40:51.866 --> 40:54.357
Today? No. No, why?

40:54.452 --> 40:57.944
So this crew targets
this blue-haired old bag.

40:58.039 --> 41:01.873
But the pop the old girl before they
can finish the job, the greedy fuckers.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.123
That was this guy Dillon?
It's empty, by the way.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.499
Ah, yeah, thanks. This guy? Yeah.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.150
My buddy thinks he's one of them, yeah.

41:09.217 --> 41:13.381
I haven't worn this
in 15 years. Wonder if it still fits.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.552
- What... what do you think this guy wants?
- Yeah...

41:18.476 --> 41:20.592
I might have a pretty good idea.

41:20.687 --> 41:24.851
But if you're trying to make
an impression, now's the time. Let's go.

41:29.946 --> 41:32.278
- What apartment is this?
- 44b.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.697
All right. One up and two over.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.821
She's this woman,
came into the hospital a bunch of times.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.742
Claimed cops used to hold her down
and inject rat blood in her eyes.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.122
What? Roberta gradischer?

41:47.213 --> 41:50.000
- You know her?
- Oh, yeah.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.249
Wait a second.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.172
It was you.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.423
Right? It was you. That's what my father
was referring to downstairs.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.850
Uh, partially, yeah.

42:02.937 --> 42:06.429
Oh, my god.
She used to say it was two cops.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.310
- Smith...
- No, Smythe.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.188
Smith and Smythe. Exactly.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.894
Did you treat her?

42:12.989 --> 42:15.446
After four times,
I had to give her an eye dropper.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.398
Told her there was holy water in it.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.735
That's funny. She actually
brought that down to the lab.

42:20.830 --> 42:23.537
She wanted us to test it for rat poison.

42:23.624 --> 42:27.458
See? She didn't trust me either.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.831
She wanted me to file a police report.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.208
On me? Wait.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.007
I et me see that.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.630
- Come here.
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

42:36.721 --> 42:37.881
- Come here.
- Oh, it's fine.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.382
Come here.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.884
It'll push itself out.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.471
- It's a surface wound.
- Yeah, it's fine.

42:44.562 --> 42:48.146
No, it was a police report.
It was for the commissioner.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.097
Yeah, she, uh...

42:50.193 --> 42:54.983
She thought that the police commissioner
was stealing her coupons.

42:55.073 --> 42:59.112
No! Shit. She's fuckin' nuts.

43:24.352 --> 43:26.638
You mind if I ask you something?

43:26.729 --> 43:30.563
I mind if you ask permission.
You wanna ask something, just ask.

43:30.650 --> 43:33.107
What... what the hell did you stay for?

43:33.194 --> 43:35.355
I mean, you had to know the storm was
gonna be bad.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.982
Right?

43:37.073 --> 43:38.233
Yeah.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.734
Do you know what a fecal transplant is?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.911
- A what?
- A fecal transplant.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.578
It's exactly what it sounds like.

43:46.666 --> 43:50.284
Doctor takes someone else's shit,
puts it in your body.

43:50.378 --> 43:51.738
- What the hell for?
- Yeah, right.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.458
It's good for colitis or something.
Troy wants me to do that.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.255
I also got some other bullshit going on.

43:56.342 --> 43:58.549
Kidneys, lungs, they're fucked.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.922
It's gonna kill me, eventually.
I'm on a million pills.

44:01.013 --> 44:04.255
She takes me to the hospital, it's over,
and I'm not going out that way.

44:04.350 --> 44:07.308
Jackpot!

44:11.440 --> 44:13.806
So you are or aren't full of shit?

44:16.028 --> 44:17.518
Shut the fuck up.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.732
I ran out of my prescription.

44:22.827 --> 44:26.695
- What's that?
- Oxy-moron. It's good for the pain.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.825
- Want one?
- I'm good.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.076
Okay.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.298
Okay. Let's go, smartass.

44:43.389 --> 44:46.426
Okay.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.849
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

44:48.936 --> 44:51.723
- Where we going?
- Oh. Apartment 44a.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.271
Ex-DEA agent lives there.
He's armed to the teeth.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.064
He's like a survivalist.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.112
See, if we're gonna stand
any kinda chance at all,

44:58.196 --> 44:59.857
we need all the firepower we can get.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.312
Remember, shoot to kill, kid.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.819
I got your back.
You got mine, all right?

45:03.910 --> 45:05.275
Here we go.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.656
Jj

45:19.300 --> 45:20.881
Get the fuck in.

45:35.358 --> 45:36.438
Fuck.

45:41.614 --> 45:43.024
Drop it.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.692
Drop it. Drop it.

45:49.455 --> 45:50.570
Slowly.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.701
Now toss it.

45:55.670 --> 45:56.750
Come on.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.586
Don't fucking move
or I'll blow your head off.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.797
Where's the old man?

46:03.511 --> 46:05.968
He's up my ass,
you wanna tickle his feet?

47:39.899 --> 47:41.309
Come on.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.186
I can't get a shot.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.617
Wow! Oh, come on. Come on.

48:41.127 --> 48:43.584
- You shot me!
- Come on!

48:45.506 --> 48:47.792
Come on!

48:47.883 --> 48:50.295
I couldn't help it. You were in the way.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.265
Where the hell did they go?
Did you see?

48:58.352 --> 49:00.468
You're kidding me.
I couldn't see anything.

49:00.563 --> 49:02.428
You're supposed to be my eyes, kid.

49:02.523 --> 49:04.013
Okay, watch out.

49:04.108 --> 49:06.269
Hey, hey! Don't. I got a key.

49:06.360 --> 49:09.147
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- This guy's a friendly.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.694
I think it's this one.

49:10.781 --> 49:11.941
Yeah, there you go.

49:14.201 --> 49:17.159
Everything I told you, right? Huh?

49:17.246 --> 49:19.703
One-stop shopping, ladies and gentlemen.

49:19.790 --> 49:22.452
- Holy shit.
- Choose your weapon.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.408
Take your pick.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.728
You a Nazi?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.491
You don't like people like me.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.667
Oh, no, I...

50:09.089 --> 50:13.048
I don't... feel that way anymore.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.922
I didn't think there was no Nazis left.

50:17.848 --> 50:21.261
I guess there gotta be some.

50:21.352 --> 50:24.389
But they must be old
as shit like your ass.

50:33.447 --> 50:34.607
Yeah.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.116
Can you hold this?

50:48.045 --> 50:50.206
Bullet passed straight through the calf.

50:50.297 --> 50:53.789
Tibia, fibula clear.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.671
Lucky me, huh?

50:57.721 --> 51:01.305
No... I'm a good shot.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.724
Yeah.

51:10.401 --> 51:14.019
Yeah, one Thanksgiving, my dad...

51:16.657 --> 51:18.989
He went out and bought
a bunch of frozen turkeys.

51:20.619 --> 51:23.326
Not for eating them.

51:23.414 --> 51:26.577
But he brought them home to just
shoot the fuck out of them all.

51:26.667 --> 51:30.376
- Just filled those birds up with lead.
- Just...

51:31.922 --> 51:34.413
Target practice.

51:37.386 --> 51:39.422
And I was really excited, 'cause...

51:40.639 --> 51:42.630
I always wanted to be a doctor.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.512
And I loved it 'cause...

51:46.520 --> 51:49.557
I got to pick all the bullets
out of the birds and...

51:50.816 --> 51:52.352
Stitch up all the holes.

51:53.444 --> 51:54.479
Wow.

51:56.405 --> 51:59.693
So what were you and my dad
really talking about downstairs?

52:06.248 --> 52:07.408
Well...

52:08.709 --> 52:10.199
For real.

52:15.841 --> 52:19.004
I used to be on the detective squad
out in New York.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.968
Real busy.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.968
Never a down moment. I loved it.

52:26.852 --> 52:31.016
And, uh, I hear a call
for a gun run one night.

52:31.106 --> 52:35.725
And, uh, I'm close, like four blocks away.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.150
I don't even hesitate. Take it.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.776
But I'm with Jasmine.

52:42.785 --> 52:44.992
Uh, she's my, um...

52:47.915 --> 52:49.246
I get it.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.879
That's actually just not far from here.

52:57.966 --> 52:59.957
No, baby, please...

53:00.052 --> 53:02.213
She asked me not to take the call.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.135
Jasmine was a cop, too.

53:09.353 --> 53:12.311
But I told her, you know,
stay in the car and...

53:13.524 --> 53:15.560
And to call for backup.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.687
I'll take care of it.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.772
So I go in there.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.026
I see a barrel.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.456
I amped up, I squeezed the trigger...

53:37.423 --> 53:39.004
And I'm just...

53:43.053 --> 53:44.884
Jasmine?

53:49.810 --> 53:51.675
Where was the guy with the gun?

53:53.731 --> 53:55.346
There was no gun.

53:55.441 --> 53:56.851
Hey!

53:56.942 --> 53:58.648
- You call this in?
- Yeah.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.422
You have any weapons on you, sir?
Do you have any weapons?

54:00.446 --> 54:03.279
This asshole just
called in a fake gun run

54:03.365 --> 54:07.529
'cause he figured that we were taking too
long to respond to his noise complaint.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.198
That's not on you, you know that.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.955
I know.

54:18.213 --> 54:21.171
But it happened to me, you know.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.254
I put her in that position.

54:33.562 --> 54:36.429
I always said I'd never
hook up with a cop.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.561
What, why? Because of your father?

54:40.652 --> 54:43.519
Yeah, I'm not really
that into kissing my dad, you know.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.401
Well, daddy issues, huh?

54:55.209 --> 54:57.416
He always wanted a boy.

55:04.885 --> 55:06.125
Troy.

55:08.514 --> 55:10.675
You really believe that?

55:14.102 --> 55:15.262
You met him.

55:16.271 --> 55:19.308
I did. Yeah.

55:19.399 --> 55:22.015
He's a fucking asshole, but...

55:22.110 --> 55:24.271
I also met you...

55:25.364 --> 55:27.605
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't think that.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.620
Well done.

55:45.676 --> 55:48.839
You act like you've
never been shot before.

55:48.929 --> 55:51.170
God, you got the touch, doc.

55:53.851 --> 55:55.341
All right.

55:55.435 --> 55:58.427
- You're good.
- Thank you.

56:06.738 --> 56:08.729
When we, uh, get out of here...

56:09.741 --> 56:11.072
Would you, um...

56:12.369 --> 56:15.031
Be open to...

56:15.122 --> 56:18.285
You know, helping me
take these stitches out?

56:18.375 --> 56:19.978
I'm gonna need 'em out for sure.

56:20.002 --> 56:22.709
No, no, I'm... I'm serious. Like, uh...

56:22.796 --> 56:25.879
I'm... I'm very particular
when it comes to making sure

56:25.966 --> 56:27.877
I get my stitches out and all that.

56:27.968 --> 56:31.176
- Okay.
- You know, needles and such.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.762
Well, I am particularly good at that.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.007
I appreciate that.

56:38.645 --> 56:39.645
Anytime.

56:40.647 --> 56:41.682
Ah!

56:42.816 --> 56:44.022
Ahh!

56:55.120 --> 56:57.361
Boss, you gotta see this.

57:04.296 --> 57:06.332
Ah, that looks nice.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.334
Nice uzi, that's a good one.

57:08.425 --> 57:11.292
Have one of these.
This could be handy.

57:11.386 --> 57:13.092
I like this little baby here.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.011
Don't you want an m4, maybe a shotgun?

57:15.098 --> 57:18.340
- Don't fucking move!
- Whoa, okay.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.682
So this is the spot?

57:23.774 --> 57:25.639
Why, you asking us or telling us?

57:25.734 --> 57:27.599
I'm asking, fuck-face.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.731
- I'm just trying to clarify is all.
- Yes.

57:33.450 --> 57:34.860
This is the spot.

57:36.703 --> 57:38.159
Put your weapons on the floor.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.034
All right, nice and slow now.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.409
Make the man happy, sweetheart.

57:44.503 --> 57:46.915
Weapons on the floor, that's it.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.870
Nice and calm now.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.880
Okay.

57:57.849 --> 57:59.134
Okay?

58:10.988 --> 58:13.320
Jj

58:36.680 --> 58:40.798
Ah, fuck me. Fuck!

58:46.857 --> 58:47.857
- Hey.
- Hey!

58:47.941 --> 58:49.226
Hey, nice fucking work, kid.

58:49.317 --> 58:51.854
I think I got a spare hole here.

58:53.613 --> 58:56.605
Yeah, fuck.
The old familiar part.

58:56.700 --> 59:00.238
Yeah, help me up.
You lie down, you die. Help me up.

59:00.328 --> 59:04.116
Okay. Okay.

59:04.207 --> 59:05.913
It's empty! It's fucking empty!

59:06.001 --> 59:08.492
I know it's fucking empty!
Shut the fuck up!

59:08.587 --> 59:10.669
Okay. The old man
knows where the art is.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.108
We find the old man, we find the art.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.542
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

59:16.511 --> 59:19.594
You trained Janet to attack the police?

59:22.017 --> 59:23.302
Yeah.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.222
Why?

59:28.440 --> 59:30.772
I was walking home from work...

59:33.570 --> 59:35.606
And two cops, they stop me.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.573
Said I match a description
of this robbery.

59:42.621 --> 59:44.828
I know what the description was.

59:46.249 --> 59:47.659
Black male...

59:49.002 --> 59:53.211
18 to 40s, 5'6 " to 6'8".

59:53.298 --> 59:57.007
I've been stopped like 20 times,
and I ain't commit any robbery.

59:58.386 --> 59:59.967
I was sick of it.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.338
So I kept walking.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.348
Said a few choice words...

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.973
Pushed off of one of them.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.609
Next thing I knew,
I was waking up in the hospital.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.862
I filed a notice of claim...

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.657
Sued the city...

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.874
And got a big ass settlement
and I moved down here.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.869
And I rescued Janet.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:39.632
Feels like dirty money.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.886
Like I took something
that didn't belong to me.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.181
You know what I mean?

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:51.603
I do.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.275
I do.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.481
Okay, ray...

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.693
Oh... that's a hole.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.033
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.366
I'm sorry, it was my fucking fault.
I'm so sorry.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.898
I was trying to do something
to give us a shot.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.584
Shut the fuck up! Jesus.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.361
You did what you had to do,
and you did good.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.717
- So own it, all right?
- I'm sorry.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.590
If we get outta this,

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.297
I'll recommend you
for any damn unit you want.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.474
Except warrants. Fuck warrants.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.946
Wow. That hurts.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.524
- Are you okay?
- Okay, let's go.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.109
Okay.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.449
Jj

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:59.246
We'll go floor by floor until we find him.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.924
What happened to them?

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.717
Well, he's not taking a nap.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.180
All right, you ready?

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:12.134
Not really, but hey,
what else are we gonna do?

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.389
Where's my vest?

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.814
Fat lot of good that did, huh?

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.732
They don't make them
big enough, do they?

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.644
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.945
Let's go.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.153
Okay.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.218
Ray!

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:52.056
Get up!

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.349
Now! Get up.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.766
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.642
Get up. Get up!

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.192
Move!

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:27.049
Go in there. In there.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:04.921
Dad?

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.875
- Hey.
- Oh, shit.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.586
- Hi, sweetie. Hi.
- I got this.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.807
I've been looking for you two all over.
Where you been?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.180
These clowns are pretty heavy tooled up.
You be careful, all right?

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.503
I'd appreciate it if you could
cap a couple of them, too.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.392
Sons of bitch...

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:27.728
It's okay. Shh...

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.273
Hey, honey...

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.610
Honey, don't. No, honey, stop.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.322
I have too many holes in me.
Just sit with me for a sec, huh?

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.782
Just sit with me for a sec.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.243
That's it. Yeah. That's it.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.790
Good shooting.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.803
I saw you down there. Good work.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.892
Hold my hand, darling. Hold my hand.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:01.685
Yeah, that's good.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.188
Come here.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.157
Jj

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.398
We gotta go.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.441
Um...

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.538
I love you, dad.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:41.952
Hey...

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.281
Will you let me know how it feels

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.991
for a bullet to go through your skin...

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.165
And into your brain?

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:57.256
Why don't you go and fuck yourself?

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.442
You know where your partner is?

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.495
How about the old man?

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.453
It was worth a shot.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.089
Adam-boy-Charlie.
Over. Do you copy?

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.436
Is it over?

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.145
We're in the eye of the storm.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.113
Open up.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.414
It's safe.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:10.787
All right.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.544
We need weapons.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.747
Guns, knives, anything that kills.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.569
Hey, we're in the fucking
same boat now, huh, Griffin?

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:20.085
Yeah. And your father?

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:28.510
It was getting real dark
in here for a minute.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:32.438
Are you okay?

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.772
We should get out of here.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.488
Poppy flowers.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.577
Vincent Van gogh, $55 million.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.375
It's here in this building.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.376
Officer cardillo.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.721
This is cardillo.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.971
I'm here with your partner, officer pena.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.638
Is she okay?

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.187
Say hello.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.854
I'm okay. I'm okay, cardillo.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.488
I'm sure you can see,
we've hit a lull in the storm.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:32.243
Which gives us about 15 minutes
to finish our business

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.916
and safely exit.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:37.166
I would suggest,
for officer pena's sake,

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.089
that you refrain from calling for backup.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.046
Officer cardillo.

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.430
I haven't called.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.980
Then I'll keep this simple for expediency.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:10:00.151
I want you, the old man and the art.

01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.535
I can't finish this here.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.452
- What is it?
- He's bleeding out.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.287
I gotta get him to a hospital, now.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.665
Officer?

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.637
You can have me and the art...

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.928
But you have to release officer pena.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.186
That's so cliché. So cliché.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.438
You know, I figured
you were the smart one.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.778
Oh...

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:45.856
Come to apartment 44a.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.816
Leave your guns.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.306
If you're not here in five minutes,
I'll execute your partner

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.321
and throw her out the fucking window.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.658
Don't make the same mistake
you made in New York.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.001
How do you know about that?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.710
I know everything.
I'm John the baptist.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.308
Where are they?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.191
Where the fuck are they?

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:31.242
- I... don't know.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.203
They came here looking for you.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.536
Did you hear what
he said they're gonna do?

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.789
They're gonna fucking kill pena,

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.836
and then they're gonna hunt us down.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.378
This storm is gonna start back up,

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:47.925
and then we're gonna be trapped.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.964
They'll be shooting fish
in a fucking barrel.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:08.779
They have been in my family since the war.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.075
- Are you a Nazi?
- No.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:19.949
My father was.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:26.172
And he passed these paintings to me.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.006
That's blood money.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.305
Are they in the building?

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.429
Are they in the fucking building?

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.977
Tell him!

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.021
Two minutes.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.032
Here. Take this.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.079
- Why?
- You're gonna need it.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:00.531
What about you?

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.537
We're gonna go on up there
and finish this.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.619
- Okay.
- I know you know how to shoot.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:11.338
You get out when you can.
Both of you.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.631
Hey...

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.598
Don't take the scaffolding.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.525
Yeah.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.743
All right, buddy. Let's go.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.247
Okay.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.334
Come on.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.454
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:49.088
Jj

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.766
- I can't.
- Hey.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.816
- I can't.
- Come on.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.365
One minute.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:35.801
Where is it?

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.385
- Let her go first.
- I don't think so.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.340
Where is it?

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.891
Jj

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.329
Come on, forward.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:13.506
Open that door, slowly.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.423
Slowly.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:27.270
You moved it all in here, huh?

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:32.066
Ray was the only person that I trusted.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.272
It's that way.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.619
After you.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.373
And if there's anything other than art
on the other side of that door...

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.459
Yeah, I know.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.966
Go in.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.946
Jj

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.790
Don't!

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:20.129
Please... take the paintings down.

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.014
Let me get the keys to your Van.

01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:33.892
- No, not my ride.
- Give me the keys to your Van.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.773
A little jumpy.

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.152
Take off your uniform.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.239
I just met you.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.321
Yeah, we're gonna get a lot closer now.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.575
All right...

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.285
Hey. You got this?

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.045
I et's have a moment.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.637
Contessa's back.

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.354
Are you satisfied?

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.103
All right, shut the fuck up.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.185
I don't know.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.862
I love the duck room.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.243
Decoys, right?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.410
Decoys!

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:49.801
These are decoys?

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:54.936
Does that look like
a fucking masterpiece to you?

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.807
No. You want the real shit?

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.267
Old man Nazi fuck,

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.648
he hid them in other people's apartments.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:11.660
Just hiding them... right in plain sight.

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.750
Yeah.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.166
Let's go find them.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.375
Well, you got a way with words.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.756
- I'll give you that.
- Come.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.051
- We're cool.
- Don't worry,

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.599
- I'm gonna let you shoot him.
- Okay.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.190
It's okay.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:45.819
It's okay.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:19.770
Ah!

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.751
If there's water coming in,
there's a way out.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:48.669
Come on, let's do this.

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.218
What... shit.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:58.430
The old man talked his way
into all these apartments?

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.226
Yeah, he owned the building.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.263
Not anymore.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.549
Oh, my god.

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.381
This is the crown Jewel.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.221
The concert.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:43.186
Johannes vermeer.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.356
Isabella Stewart gardner

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:52.154
bought this painting at an auction
in Paris in 1892 for $5,000.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:58.403
And now it has
an estimated worth... 200 million.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.039
Art sucks.

01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.373
Take it down.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.882
Hey. Carefully.

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:39.531
Okay. Okay. Hey, look at me.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.738
Look at me. We're gonna be okay.
We're not gonna die.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.164
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.569
There's gotta be a way out of here.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:49.870
Hey, hey. This... hold this light.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.626
- What are you doing?
- I'm going down.

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.653
Point the light down.
I'm going to find a way out.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:56.214
Okay. One, two, three.

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:08.560
Oh, shit.

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.905
Jj

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.532
What's in there?

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.580
I don't know. Nothing.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:34.248
That's a lot of locks for nothing.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.549
Open the door.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.853
Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.310
Anything?

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.111
- Oh, shit.
- I got you. I got you.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.235
Okay.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:00.361
Oh...

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.238
- Anything?
- I found it.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.160
Take my... take it.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.614
- Okay.
- Okay. We're gonna get outta here.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.074
Here we go. One, two, three...

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:27.476
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Open it!

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.104
All right.

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.149
Suit yourself.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.311
Knock, knock.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.443
How we holding up there, sir?

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.945
You doing all right?

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.691
I'm thankful to be alive.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.695
Thank you, doc.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.540
Excuse me, sir.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:36.212
Uh, I'm here to take a statement
on an incident that happened

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.880
at an apartment building
not far from here.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.211
Who woulda thought...

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.666
That I'd be this happy to see
a cop walk through them doors?

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.177
How'd you get out?

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.146
Well, uh...

01:25:56.735 --> 01:26:00.023
I fed your cat while you were out.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.944
We have a 10-31 in progress.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:06.866
- That's our cue.
- On our way.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:11.071
Yeah. Hey, doc, um,
do you wanna look at my leg?

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.583
Mm, we already played doctor, didn't we?

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:16.456
Are you going to take my stitches out?

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:20.038
- You gonna take me out?
- Bet your sweet ass I am.

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:23.546
I... I didn't mean it
like that, obviously.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:25.798
Respect to your, like, workplace.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:27.379
No pressure.

01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:29.055
- No pressure.
- This is that moment...

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:30.382
- Yeah.
- Where I'm gonna...

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:33.560
- This can wait.
- Yeah, of course.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.228
- I would not... I would...
- No.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.601
- I'm not gonna cross any lines.
- No. I know.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.810
Okay. Can I... if I beg you?

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.695
All right. Let's go.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.026
Rock me like a hurricane.

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.161
Hey...

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:51.737
- I got you something.
- Okay.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.835
Jj

01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:10.673
Fuck.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.635
Now I gotta figure out
how to sell this shit.

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:23.828
Jj
