00:24.622 --> 00:26.221
ice on my fingers and my toes

00:26.221 --> 00:27.720

00:27.720 --> 00:30.453
Uh, check-check it, yeah

00:30.453 --> 00:32.551

00:33.918 --> 00:35.950

00:37.915 --> 00:39.414

00:39.414 --> 00:41.580
and the girlies want to scream ?

00:41.580 --> 00:43.679
Aqua Teen Hunger Force,

00:43.679 --> 00:45.611
Number One in the hood, g.

00:45.611 --> 00:46.910
[captioning made possible by

00:46.910 --> 00:47.943
Turner Entertainment Group]

00:47.943 --> 00:48.609
So, the bum said,

00:48.609 --> 00:49.276
"i ate it off the sidewalk

00:49.276 --> 00:50.975
with my balls!"

00:50.975 --> 00:52.441
Ha ha ha ha.

00:52.441 --> 00:53.207
I kid ya.

00:53.207 --> 00:54.440
I love all people.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.272
Hey, you know what a walrus and

00:56.272 --> 00:58.238
Tupperware have in common?

00:58.238 --> 00:59.104
They're both looking for a

00:59.104 --> 01:00.603
tight seal.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.002
No takers over at that table,

01:02.002 --> 01:02.909
right, ladies?

01:02.909 --> 01:04.441
Ha ha ha.

01:04.441 --> 01:05.575
But seriously, I'd like to bring

01:05.575 --> 01:07.273
it down a notch.

01:07.273 --> 01:09.638
? I see your face

01:09.638 --> 01:11.005
your rosy, rosy cheeks ?

01:14.036 --> 01:16.535
? And I mean your buns

01:16.535 --> 01:20.099
those squishy, mushy buns... ?

01:20.099 --> 01:22.831
I wasn't always a superstar.

01:22.831 --> 01:25.697
I used to be a boring old cup.

01:25.697 --> 01:27.229
Why would anyone make a show

01:27.229 --> 01:28.262
about something you'd throw

01:28.262 --> 01:29.662
away?

01:29.662 --> 01:32.260
But things changed, my friend.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.225
Money rolled in like waves

01:34.225 --> 01:36.691
lapping on the shore.

01:36.691 --> 01:38.723
And if you've got talent,

01:38.723 --> 01:39.889
well, they'll find you.

01:42.954 --> 01:44.420
But, listen.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.519
Let me speak to a supervisor.

01:46.519 --> 01:47.452
Because you were very rude to

01:47.452 --> 01:48.518
me!

01:48.518 --> 01:50.584
I will fly directly to India

01:50.584 --> 01:52.782
tonight, and I will see your

01:52.782 --> 01:54.015
face in my face!

01:54.015 --> 01:54.682
The TV ain't working.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.348
What?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.014
Hey!

01:56.014 --> 01:56.680
What's your name?

01:56.680 --> 01:57.413
What is your name?!

01:57.413 --> 01:58.113
Give me your name!

01:58.113 --> 01:59.446
Hey, who you talking to?

01:59.446 --> 02:00.811
I am about to find out.

02:00.811 --> 02:01.511
Yes, can--

02:03.250 --> 02:06.016
Hung up.

02:06.016 --> 02:07.581
Let's see if he fixed it.

02:11.112 --> 02:12.512
Did he fix the TV?

02:12.512 --> 02:13.778
You tell me.

02:13.778 --> 02:14.811
Well...

02:19.342 --> 02:20.041
Yeah.

02:20.041 --> 02:20.841
Let me tell you about these

02:20.841 --> 02:21.773
people.

02:21.773 --> 02:23.139
And they grow these shows in

02:23.139 --> 02:24.839
India and they're my favorite

02:24.839 --> 02:26.704
shows--and they know that.

02:26.704 --> 02:28.337
And since I've produced them,

02:28.337 --> 02:29.703
they won't give them to me for

02:29.703 --> 02:30.402
free.

02:30.402 --> 02:31.502
Hey...

02:31.502 --> 02:32.868
Let's watch the TV,

02:32.868 --> 02:34.201
see if you starring in another

02:34.201 --> 02:35.399
of them movies.

02:40.730 --> 02:43.629
I swear to God!

02:43.629 --> 02:45.095
A whole night of TV has been

02:45.095 --> 02:46.027
ruined.

02:46.027 --> 02:47.293
Thank you, India!

02:47.293 --> 02:48.126
Hey, you remember that one

02:48.126 --> 02:48.993
show?

02:48.993 --> 02:50.059
Roid-away, apply directly

02:50.059 --> 02:50.992
to the roid.

02:50.992 --> 02:51.991
Roid-away, apply directly

02:51.991 --> 02:53.058
to the roid.

02:53.058 --> 02:54.557
Apply directly to the roid.

02:54.557 --> 02:55.689
That's a good show.

02:55.689 --> 02:56.655
Yeah.

02:56.655 --> 02:57.821
That was good.

02:57.821 --> 02:58.754
Well, you don't think it got

02:58.754 --> 02:59.787
nothing to do with that thing

02:59.787 --> 03:01.253
out there, do you?

03:03.792 --> 03:04.957
Well...

03:04.957 --> 03:06.223
No.

03:06.223 --> 03:07.123
It's the Indians

03:07.123 --> 03:08.589
and their barbaric ways--

03:08.589 --> 03:10.754
yogurt runs down their faces and

03:10.754 --> 03:12.553
boobs flapping around!

03:12.553 --> 03:15.252
Hey, you ever hear of a bra?!

03:15.252 --> 03:16.785
I've seen one.

03:16.785 --> 03:17.484
Hey, man.

03:17.484 --> 03:18.150
What the hell is this tower

03:18.150 --> 03:18.817
doing here?

03:18.817 --> 03:19.749
Oh, that?

03:19.749 --> 03:21.249
It's pretty sweet, eh?

03:21.249 --> 03:22.414
This dude's giving me 40 bucks

03:22.414 --> 03:23.847
a month to put it here,

03:23.847 --> 03:25.780
and I ain't gotta do jack!

03:25.780 --> 03:27.545
Except rake in the jack!

03:27.545 --> 03:28.378
Ha ha!

03:28.378 --> 03:29.111
You know what I mean?

03:29.111 --> 03:29.810
Yeah, Carl.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.177
40 large!

03:31.177 --> 03:31.977
What's it do?

03:31.977 --> 03:32.743
Well, it'll mess with your

03:32.743 --> 03:34.308
telephone and your television,

03:34.308 --> 03:34.975
too.

03:34.975 --> 03:35.708
Yeah.

03:35.708 --> 03:36.740
Yeah, it definitely does that.

03:36.740 --> 03:37.640
But mine comes in great.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.373
I mean, you gotta check this

03:38.373 --> 03:39.073
out, dude.

03:39.073 --> 03:41.138
I got great picture here.

03:44.703 --> 03:46.302
You ever seen this show?

03:46.302 --> 03:47.134
No.

03:47.134 --> 03:48.134
I don't think so.

03:48.134 --> 03:49.068
It's insane.

03:49.068 --> 03:50.267
Nothing happens.

03:50.267 --> 03:51.433
But I'm addicted to it.

03:51.433 --> 03:52.232
Is this a show?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.665
Yeah, no one gets it but me,

03:53.665 --> 03:54.398
you know.

03:54.398 --> 03:55.830
It's exclusive to Carl!

04:01.462 --> 04:02.600
Huh.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.100
Ok, so...

04:04.100 --> 04:05.032
What's it about?

04:05.032 --> 04:06.098
Well, you know, it's pretty

04:06.098 --> 04:07.098
boring, really.

04:07.098 --> 04:08.530
'Cause whenever I look up,

04:08.530 --> 04:09.597
they start pretending to stack

04:09.597 --> 04:10.696
stuff.

04:10.696 --> 04:11.729
But, hey, I got all day to do

04:11.729 --> 04:13.460
this--now that I got an outside

04:13.460 --> 04:14.694
source of income!

04:14.694 --> 04:15.959
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

04:15.959 --> 04:17.125
40 big 'uns!

04:17.125 --> 04:17.858
Damn, man.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.625
Do your eyes hurt?

04:18.625 --> 04:19.423
Last couple days, they have

04:19.423 --> 04:20.291
bothered me.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.224
They feel like they're growing

04:21.224 --> 04:21.890
or something.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.056
But, hey...

04:23.056 --> 04:24.788
If you pop some Aspirin, I'm

04:24.788 --> 04:26.753
good to go.

04:26.753 --> 04:28.053
Oh, gross.

04:28.053 --> 04:29.252
Nah, don't worry about that.

04:29.252 --> 04:29.919
Ugh!

04:29.919 --> 04:30.718
Just tilt your head back.

04:30.718 --> 04:31.818
Just tilt your head back!

04:31.818 --> 04:32.551
That's right!

04:32.551 --> 04:33.217
Oh!

04:33.217 --> 04:33.984
That's what those guys told

04:33.984 --> 04:34.749
me to do--

04:34.749 --> 04:36.349
and it worked.

04:36.349 --> 04:38.415
How's it look?

04:38.415 --> 04:40.380
Keep going.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.912
Further.

04:42.912 --> 04:43.845
It's getting--oh--it's getting

04:43.845 --> 04:45.244
clearer.

04:45.244 --> 04:45.944
A little more.

04:45.944 --> 04:46.610
A little more.

04:46.610 --> 04:47.343
Ok.

04:47.343 --> 04:48.142
Clear.

04:48.142 --> 04:48.842
It's getting definitely--

04:48.842 --> 04:49.608
it's getting clearer now.

04:49.608 --> 04:50.275
Getting better?

04:50.275 --> 04:50.941
Roger.

04:50.941 --> 04:52.374
Keep going.

04:52.374 --> 04:54.339
Further.

04:54.339 --> 04:55.873
Getting clearer.

04:55.873 --> 04:56.638
Perfect!

04:56.638 --> 04:58.171
Ok, stay right where you are!

04:58.171 --> 04:59.237
Do not move!

05:01.469 --> 05:02.675
Whoa!

05:02.675 --> 05:05.274
Sweet!

05:05.274 --> 05:06.539
Great.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.172
Now it's snowy again.

05:09.904 --> 05:10.738
Ugh!

05:10.738 --> 05:11.570
What's wrong with him?

05:11.570 --> 05:12.436
You need to watch what you're

05:12.436 --> 05:13.636
doing to him.

05:13.636 --> 05:14.302
Ow!

05:14.302 --> 05:15.934
Frylock, you know me.

05:15.934 --> 05:17.201
My love for him

05:17.201 --> 05:19.466
is beyond any...

05:19.466 --> 05:20.299
Rivers.

05:20.299 --> 05:21.032
Look, we gotta do something

05:21.032 --> 05:21.964
about that tower.

05:21.964 --> 05:23.031
I'll show you what a man does

05:23.031 --> 05:23.697
with it.

05:24.497 --> 05:25.762
Shake, no!

05:25.762 --> 05:26.462
Ok, look.

05:26.462 --> 05:27.295
Just let me climb it and see

05:27.295 --> 05:27.695
what the deal is.
Just do me one favor and don't

05:29.827 --> 05:31.560
destroy it until I get down, ok?

05:31.560 --> 05:32.793
Ok.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.691
Oh, my freakin' head.

05:34.691 --> 05:36.291
You need to tilt your head

05:36.291 --> 05:37.356
back, Carl!

05:37.356 --> 05:38.856
You must keep your blood...

05:38.856 --> 05:39.889
oh!

05:39.889 --> 05:40.822
Further!

05:40.822 --> 05:41.788
Further!

05:41.788 --> 05:42.520
it's really hurting.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.453
Further, further!

05:43.453 --> 05:44.586
Yeah, see, I--if I do it

05:44.586 --> 05:45.319
any more--

05:45.319 --> 05:46.452
Tilt your head back further.

05:46.452 --> 05:47.351
I think the blood's coming

05:47.351 --> 05:48.285
out of my eyes.

05:48.285 --> 05:49.550
Put spoons over them.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.284
Aagh.

05:50.284 --> 05:51.083
Carl?!

05:51.083 --> 05:51.916
What?

05:51.916 --> 05:54.047
Someone climbs the tower.

05:54.047 --> 05:55.681
You know what you must do,

05:55.681 --> 05:56.980
Beast Man.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.779
Yes, master.

05:58.779 --> 05:59.779
Hey!

06:04.516 --> 06:06.181
Get off of the tower!

06:06.181 --> 06:07.380
No!

06:07.380 --> 06:08.180
Uh.

06:08.180 --> 06:08.979
He won't come down.

06:08.979 --> 06:11.012
Then we shall tell him--

06:11.012 --> 06:12.911
in our own little way!

06:16.242 --> 06:18.609
Send voice-over artist George

06:18.609 --> 06:19.841
Lowe.

06:19.841 --> 06:21.240
Yeah!

06:21.240 --> 06:24.271
George Lowe will force him from

06:24.271 --> 06:26.505
the tower!

06:26.505 --> 06:28.004
What's up, Fry-Lam.

06:28.004 --> 06:28.903
Who are you?

06:28.903 --> 06:29.936
Captain Beefy,

06:29.936 --> 06:31.435
Georm Loam.

06:31.435 --> 06:33.533
Hail Geebonla Forever.

06:33.533 --> 06:34.433
So, what do you--

06:34.433 --> 06:35.900
God bless you and all you do

06:35.900 --> 06:37.432
for television, Frylock.

06:37.432 --> 06:38.431
You know, our children are

06:38.431 --> 06:39.663
learning from you.

06:39.663 --> 06:40.330
So you--

06:40.330 --> 06:41.596
you look tasty and heavily

06:41.596 --> 06:42.262
salted.

06:42.262 --> 06:43.095
Ok, ok, ok, look--

06:43.095 --> 06:44.095
my ex-girlfriend--

06:44.095 --> 06:45.127
man, look!

06:45.127 --> 06:46.160
Can I stop you for a second, ok?

06:46.160 --> 06:47.394
Another joke for another

06:47.394 --> 06:48.193
time.

06:48.193 --> 06:49.058
So, why are you here?

06:49.058 --> 06:49.858
The home office in Grand

06:49.858 --> 06:51.624
Rapid sent me down to get you

06:51.624 --> 06:52.656
off the tower.

06:52.656 --> 06:53.490
Uh...

06:53.490 --> 06:54.256
It's affecting the morning

06:54.256 --> 06:55.422
show--you being here.

06:55.422 --> 06:56.454
The morning guys can't do their

06:56.454 --> 06:57.488
thing--the nutty bunch--

06:57.488 --> 06:58.487
Larry and Eric.

06:58.487 --> 06:59.352
So, wait--

06:59.352 --> 07:00.319
can you get me a regular gig?

07:00.319 --> 07:01.086
What?

07:01.086 --> 07:02.291
Ha ha ha.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.658
It's a joke, for God's sake.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.690
Ok, let's start this again.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.524
Ok?

07:05.524 --> 07:06.323
Who are you?

07:06.323 --> 07:07.388
George Lowe.

07:07.388 --> 07:09.088
I've been hired by aliens to

07:09.088 --> 07:10.854
tell you to get off the tower.

07:10.854 --> 07:12.586
I am the voice master.

07:12.586 --> 07:14.019
George, I'm not getting off

07:14.019 --> 07:14.684
the tower.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.951
That's fine, Aunt Crabby.

07:15.951 --> 07:17.350
I still get paid.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.383
You just stay right where you

07:18.383 --> 07:19.083
are.

07:19.083 --> 07:19.882
Seriously!

07:19.882 --> 07:21.248
I got 40 large to do this gig.

07:21.248 --> 07:21.948
Wow.

07:21.948 --> 07:22.747
$40, huh?

07:22.747 --> 07:24.046
It's all in their currency,

07:24.046 --> 07:25.513
but they say the Yorlok is very

07:25.513 --> 07:26.946
strong in the states right now.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.945
And mom agreed.

07:27.945 --> 07:29.844
So, here we all are.

07:29.844 --> 07:30.710
She's like, "you're getting how

07:30.710 --> 07:31.609
many Yorloks for this?"

07:31.609 --> 07:32.675
I said, "oh, don't you worry,

07:32.675 --> 07:33.342
baby.

07:33.342 --> 07:34.174
Enough to crank the generator

07:34.174 --> 07:35.341
back up another week or two."

07:35.341 --> 07:36.107
George--

07:36.107 --> 07:36.840
the Yorlok.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.673
Isn't that that new bag that

07:37.673 --> 07:38.905
seals in freshness, the Yorlok?

07:38.905 --> 07:39.706
George, please.

07:39.706 --> 07:40.538
Hold on a second.

07:40.538 --> 07:41.537
I want to try and give you some

07:41.537 --> 07:43.170
Mason Adams here.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.069
Yorlok...

07:44.069 --> 07:44.902
George?

07:44.902 --> 07:45.835
It keeps your food fresher

07:45.835 --> 07:46.535
longer.

07:46.535 --> 07:47.334
Earth to George.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.101
A product of Ching Dowdy

07:49.101 --> 07:49.900
Doodoo Industries.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.299
George?!

07:51.299 --> 07:52.331
Why you?

07:52.331 --> 07:53.464
I was available.

07:53.464 --> 07:56.163
They couldn't afford Lafontaine.

07:56.163 --> 07:58.928
Yeah, Mr. $30,000 a minute.

07:58.928 --> 07:59.695
No way!

07:59.695 --> 08:00.595
Mr. Big Shot.

08:00.595 --> 08:01.759
In a world...

08:01.759 --> 08:02.466
You smell that?

08:02.466 --> 08:03.566
...Where towers rule the

08:03.566 --> 08:04.033
universe.

08:04.033 --> 08:04.765
Is that smoke?

08:04.765 --> 08:05.664
You're telling me that ain't

08:05.664 --> 08:06.331
the same?!

08:06.331 --> 08:06.997
Seriously.

08:06.997 --> 08:07.663
That's the same.

08:07.663 --> 08:08.330
George!

08:08.330 --> 08:09.030
I smell some folk art burning.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.695
Folk art?!

08:09.695 --> 08:10.362
Where?!

08:10.895 --> 08:11.495
Hey, wait a minute.

08:11.495 --> 08:12.128
Take my demo on cassette.

08:12.128 --> 08:12.828
Oh, hey, better yet, go to the

08:12.828 --> 08:13.561
William Morris web site--

08:13.561 --> 08:14.860
New York demos voice talent

08:14.860 --> 08:15.960
under Radio Imagining

08:15.960 --> 08:16.926
it's at the New York site

08:16.926 --> 08:17.725
though, not the Beverly Hills

08:17.725 --> 08:19.657
one!

08:21.390 --> 08:22.789
It didn't work!

08:22.789 --> 08:24.288
You need to tilt your head back,

08:24.288 --> 08:25.254
Carl.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.687
I can't tilt it back any

08:26.687 --> 08:27.620
further, dude.

08:27.620 --> 08:30.484
The waves are very dangerous.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.150
But we pay you handsomely.

08:32.150 --> 08:32.917
I know, and I appreciate

08:32.917 --> 08:33.582
that.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.716
But, uh...

08:34.716 --> 08:35.948
I mean, look at that blood in

08:35.948 --> 08:37.581
here, man, I gotta run a wet-vac

08:37.581 --> 08:38.447
through here or something.

08:38.447 --> 08:40.113
No, you will stay,

08:40.113 --> 08:42.544
and you will watch us stack.

08:47.409 --> 08:49.209
Ok.

08:49.209 --> 08:50.740
What about the tower though?

08:50.740 --> 08:52.107
Oh, let him come.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.906
And we will crush him with

08:53.906 --> 08:56.271
out mighty fists of rage.

08:58.937 --> 08:59.736
What are you two doing?

08:59.736 --> 09:00.403
Aagh!

09:00.403 --> 09:01.069
Don't touch us!

09:01.069 --> 09:01.868
Leave us alone!

09:01.868 --> 09:02.707
Aagh!

09:02.707 --> 09:03.541
Carl, wake up!

09:03.541 --> 09:04.374
No, I'm awake.

09:04.374 --> 09:05.173
I'm up, I'm up.

09:05.173 --> 09:05.940
What?!

09:05.940 --> 09:06.739
This isn't a cell tower at

09:06.739 --> 09:07.439
all.

09:07.439 --> 09:08.372
This tower goes all the way up

09:08.372 --> 09:09.204
to their planet.

09:09.204 --> 09:10.371
They were gonna climb down it

09:10.371 --> 09:11.602
and attack us.

09:12.403 --> 09:13.136
Whoa!

09:13.136 --> 09:14.001
What the hell was that?!

09:16.067 --> 09:18.066
$20 for an autograph?

09:18.066 --> 09:19.698
You are out of your mind.

09:19.698 --> 09:21.398
Daddy gets 25 for a sketch.

09:21.398 --> 09:22.564
From who?

09:22.564 --> 09:23.596
Shoot, boy.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.496
For that much, it ought to come

09:24.496 --> 09:25.895
with a hand-job or something.

09:25.895 --> 09:26.829
Oh, it does.

09:26.829 --> 09:27.728
Will you please keep it down

09:27.728 --> 09:29.027
while I'm trying to saw?!

09:31.092 --> 09:31.792
Hello?

09:31.792 --> 09:32.858
Shake, don't cut down that

09:32.858 --> 09:33.658
antenna.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.357
Give me one good reason--

09:35.357 --> 09:36.889
besides the fact that you asked

09:36.889 --> 09:38.288
me nicely before you went up

09:38.288 --> 09:38.988
there.

09:38.988 --> 09:40.155
You know, shake, they--

09:40.155 --> 09:41.521
they get every TV show up here.

09:41.521 --> 09:42.654
I mean, even Pay-Per-View.

09:42.654 --> 09:43.320
Stay there.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.485
I'm coming up.

09:47.318 --> 09:48.151
All right.

09:48.151 --> 09:49.383
Where's the TV?

09:49.383 --> 09:53.515
You are the TV.

09:53.515 --> 09:54.547
Well, where are the shows?

09:54.547 --> 09:57.079
You are the show!

09:59.777 --> 10:03.483
Let the entertainment happen!

10:03.483 --> 10:04.449
Begin!

10:04.449 --> 10:05.381
Wait!

10:05.381 --> 10:06.081
Where's--

10:06.081 --> 10:06.881
where's--where's Frylock?!

10:06.881 --> 10:08.180
Shake, it's a trick!

10:08.180 --> 10:09.579
They used me to get to you.

10:09.579 --> 10:10.879
They want to you

10:10.879 --> 10:13.144
to entertain them forever.

10:14.177 --> 10:15.475
Yeah, I told them it was a

10:15.475 --> 10:16.575
pretty good idea.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.541
So, I helped them.

10:21.540 --> 10:22.339
Well, where the hell you

10:22.339 --> 10:23.139
going?

10:23.139 --> 10:24.671
Oh...

10:24.671 --> 10:25.804
I was acting.

10:25.804 --> 10:27.536
You know, like on TV.

10:27.536 --> 10:28.936
That was pretty good acting.

10:28.936 --> 10:30.767
Here are your 40 Yorloks.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.799
Use them wisely.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.199
On George Lowe's autograph.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.731
You can get two for that.

10:36.731 --> 10:39.596
Or a sketch and a hand-job!

10:40.929 --> 10:42.761
All right, hey!

10:42.761 --> 10:43.928
Well, we've been having some

10:43.928 --> 10:44.594
fun.

10:44.594 --> 10:45.327
And don't go away

10:45.327 --> 10:46.126
'cause we'll be...

10:46.126 --> 10:47.959
...Right back with the Master

10:47.959 --> 10:50.425
Shake Show on every channel.

10:50.425 --> 10:51.290
George?

10:51.290 --> 10:53.156
We're global, worldwide,

10:53.156 --> 10:54.155
every channel.

10:54.155 --> 10:54.888
George?

10:54.888 --> 10:55.721
All the friggin' channels,

10:55.721 --> 10:56.721
all the friggin' time.

10:56.721 --> 10:57.620
George?

10:57.620 --> 10:58.786
Same little cup yapping away.

10:58.786 --> 11:00.352
George?!

11:00.352 --> 11:01.018
Please!

11:01.018 --> 11:02.024
Well, I can do that.

11:02.024 --> 11:03.157
It's what I do.

11:03.157 --> 11:03.990
And they got this weasel

11:03.990 --> 11:05.290
knocking down 6 figures every

11:05.290 --> 11:06.189
Monday.

11:06.189 --> 11:07.155
He's taken over The Internet,

11:07.155 --> 11:08.088
you know?

11:08.088 --> 11:09.187
I had a 6-figure deal with The

11:09.187 --> 11:10.220
Internet.

11:10.220 --> 11:11.186
Now it's gone.

11:11.186 --> 11:12.086
They're holding him hostage,

11:12.086 --> 11:12.918
George.

11:12.918 --> 11:13.818
It's different, ok?

11:13.818 --> 11:14.685
It's not different when he's

11:14.685 --> 11:15.584
a star.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.281
I mean, they took my picture

11:17.281 --> 11:18.678
down at the barbecue joint,

11:18.678 --> 11:20.640
Frylock, and they put his up.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.672
Hey, Frylock,

11:21.672 --> 11:24.000
what's a hand-job?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.330
'Cause I'm about to get one!
