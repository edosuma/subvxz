WEBVTT

00:16.850 --> 00:18.084
(Shoresy): Thanks, Eddie.
(Laura): Thanks, Ed.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.120
You're welcome. My pleasure.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.255
You know, you could have
breakfast with me every day

00:22.255 --> 00:24.024
- of the week if you wanted.
- I know.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.625
So, you wanna talk
about the Yanks?

00:25.625 --> 00:27.827
- I need a quote.
- Yeah, so--

00:27.827 --> 00:29.829
You should look at people
when they're talkin' to you.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.498
No, it's better this way.
Trust me.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.199
- Why?
- 'Cause you're so fuckin' hot

00:33.199 --> 00:35.668
I can't look at you
and focus at the same time.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.270
- Uh-oh.
- Which sucks because

00:37.270 --> 00:39.105
I just wanna let you in so bad.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.440
You've really got
those walls up.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.409
Look, I've made mistakes
in the past, okay?

00:42.409 --> 00:44.978
I show myself to people
too quickly then I get hurt.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.313
- Try, for me.
- All right, but you look

00:47.313 --> 00:48.615
like that so don't be surprised

00:48.615 --> 00:50.383
if I look like I wanna be
underneath ya.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.752
- I'll try to conceal it.
- Oh, my God.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.888
- I need a quote.
- You ever look at someone,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.357
they look so good
you just wanna go, "No way!"

00:57.357 --> 00:58.858
- No.
- You never had that?

00:58.858 --> 01:00.827
You look at someone,
you just wanna go, "All right!"

01:00.827 --> 01:02.495
- The Soo Hunt--
- Oh, I tell the boys,

01:02.495 --> 01:04.464
the sexiest thing about ya
is your mind and

01:04.464 --> 01:06.766
here I am breaking a sweat
'cause I can see your bra's

01:06.766 --> 01:08.635
- a non-traditional colour.
- Yeah, what else

01:08.635 --> 01:10.370
- do ya tell 'em?
- I just tell 'em how much

01:10.370 --> 01:13.106
you challenge me and make me
curious with your ideas.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.774
- Do ya?
- You know, I've never had

01:14.774 --> 01:16.709
someone expand my horizons
like this.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.478
I don't know what
do to with you, man.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.746
Laura, it's taken me
a lifetime

01:19.746 --> 01:21.915
- but I finally feel alive.
- I'm not gonna get

01:21.915 --> 01:23.450
my quote, am I?

01:24.717 --> 01:26.453
Gimme a shot, Mohr.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.388
Text me something.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.060
What do you really say about me?

01:34.060 --> 01:35.929
- I'll never tell.
- I'm a journalist,

01:35.929 --> 01:37.430
I'll keep asking.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.669
You're smart, capable,
rational, dependable,

01:42.669 --> 01:45.972
outgoing, kind, consistent,
you're a leader.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.944
And you smell so fuckin' good.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.946
Yeah?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.614
Quote me.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.051
(electronic music plays)

02:08.328 --> 02:10.430
(Shoresy): Let's pump some blood
into those pipes here, boys!

02:10.430 --> 02:12.632
Let's go now!
Let's do some Arnold press.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.801
What's with the half reps?
Goblet squats, eh?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.302
Ever try a goblet squat
hell set?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.871
Let's do some power bombs!

02:17.871 --> 02:19.506
Maybe if you did a couple more
calf raises

02:19.506 --> 02:21.407
you'd win a foot race.
You ever try a Swiss ball

02:21.407 --> 02:23.176
wall squat?
Let's do some renegade rows.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.644
Cross body hammer curls, eh?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.779
Come talk to me if you really
wanna fill those bis up

02:26.779 --> 02:28.748
with blood.
I think you mean hypertrophy,

02:28.748 --> 02:30.517
ya fuckin' idiot.
Maybe if you did a couple more

02:30.517 --> 02:33.219
wrist curls you'd win
a face-off. Let's do
some skull crushers.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.855
Let's do some widow makers.
Let's do some Zottman curls.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.524
Bulgarian split squats, eh?

02:37.524 --> 02:39.259
You ever try
a Bulgarian glute smash?

02:39.259 --> 02:40.793
Put a sweater on, Fish!

02:40.793 --> 02:42.762
Tight clothes at the gym's
for broads.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.165
Let's do some wood chops.
Cable rope pushdowns, eh?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.066
Come talk to me if you really
wanna fill those tris

02:47.066 --> 02:48.735
up with blood.
Whadda ya think, drop sets?

02:48.735 --> 02:51.237
Power rack's that way.
First one to leave, eh, Fish?

02:51.237 --> 02:52.939
Maybe if ya did a couple
more supersets

02:52.939 --> 02:54.174
you'd still be tuckin'
one a game.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.009
Don't forget the cooldown here, boys.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.677
Let's everybody cool down
here now.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.513
Shoresy, Nat wants to see us.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.448
Fer what?
(Nat): I dunno.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.816
- Frankie?
- Yeah.

03:03.816 --> 03:04.851
(Ziig and Shoresy): Huh?

03:04.851 --> 03:05.852
That's embarrassing.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.886
Don't shoot the messenger.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.021
I don't like this, my guy.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.156
It's not for you
to like, Sanguinet.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.659
Fuckin' Frankie gets
his own calendar?

03:12.659 --> 03:13.893
- Frankie is--
- Huh?

03:13.893 --> 03:16.229
- Frankie is in demand.
- Stop yelling, dude.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.698
- Who needs a calendar anymore?
- This is the north.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.266
People have a shed,
people have a shop.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.702
You all got jacked
so it just made sense.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.237
- To what?
- To exploit you, slut.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.372
I gotta--
I need a ride uptown.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.108
- Why?
- Because if JJ Frito JJ

03:29.108 --> 03:30.910
gets his own calendar,
I'm gonna throw myself

03:30.910 --> 03:33.313
- in front of a bus.
- I'll drive.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.714
Do we really need
another calendar?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.516
If we wanna host the National
Senior Tournament

03:36.516 --> 03:38.751
we need to show them 50K.
It's their way of ensuring

03:38.751 --> 03:40.086
the tournament won't get
cancelled again due to

03:40.086 --> 03:42.021
- lack of funding.
- How much do we have now?

03:42.021 --> 03:43.823
- Twenty.
- We need Frankie focused

03:43.823 --> 03:45.558
- on the Yanks.
- You're right, Shoresy.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.061
We need everyone focused
on the final three games

03:48.061 --> 03:49.796
if we want that record.

03:49.796 --> 03:54.334
So, what are those sluts
doing right now? Focusing?

03:54.334 --> 03:57.170
(electronic music plays)

04:11.484 --> 04:12.885
(music stops)

04:12.885 --> 04:13.987
I'll get 'em focused.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.521
They'll need it
for the Soo Hunt.

04:15.521 --> 04:16.656
We'll beat the Yanks!

04:16.656 --> 04:18.625
Frankie has the most
goals in the NOSHO.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.959
Frankie's on top of the world.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.396
I'm not concerned
with his focus. Overly.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.331
And we'll only need
them for the afternoon.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.933
- So dumb!
- I've heard rumblings

04:26.933 --> 04:28.501
about Frankie's following
post-calendar,

04:28.501 --> 04:30.169
but is it really
like that big?

04:30.169 --> 04:32.238
Why do you think we have
so many bums in seats?

04:32.238 --> 04:33.773
'Cause we're on
a 21-game heater!

04:33.773 --> 04:37.076
Uh... these guys
aren't here for the W's.

04:37.076 --> 04:39.045
What guys?

04:40.046 --> 04:41.547
Do you know what a bear is?

04:41.547 --> 04:43.283
- A bear?
- Yeah, do--

04:43.283 --> 04:46.119
- Huh?
- What's a bear, Shoresy?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.821
Fuckin' Yogi,
Paddington, and Pooh.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.824
- The other kind.
- Gummy?

04:52.258 --> 04:54.327
You don't know much about
the gay community, do you?

04:54.327 --> 04:55.895
- Me?
- Oh, my God.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.197
Why would I know anything
about the gay community?

04:58.197 --> 05:00.133
Fuckin' honey dickin'
broads only.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.834
- My guy.
- Fuckin' honey dickin'

05:01.834 --> 05:03.536
- only broads.
- Same.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.472
In the gay community,
a bear is a larger,

05:06.472 --> 05:09.575
often hairier, man who projects
an image of rugged masculinity.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.444
Why would she be talking
about gummy bears?

05:11.444 --> 05:14.180
Frankie being a larger,
hairier man

05:14.180 --> 05:16.849
has garnered the attention
of the Sudbury gay community

05:16.849 --> 05:19.285
who are offering
a large sum of money

05:19.285 --> 05:22.388
for a calendar
exclusively of Frankie.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.924
- This can divide the room.
- No, it won't.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.492
Hockey players
are competitive.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.795
Fuckin' the entire team
strips down and greases up

05:28.795 --> 05:31.064
and all gay dudes
want is Frankie?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.231
Read it and weep.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.866
What can the rest
of the boys do?

05:33.866 --> 05:35.201
Could suck their
dicks, Shorey.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.136
- (laughs)
- They only want Frankie.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.872
I told ya this calendar'd
bite us in the ass, Nat.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.607
Don't know what to tell ya, dude.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.710
You just weren't sexy enough.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.178
(Hitch): What's all this?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.412
(Shoresy): We weren't
sexy enough.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.580
(Goody): Settle down.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.048
Well you're some crooked
aren't ya, b'y?

05:49.048 --> 05:50.717
(speaking French)

05:50.717 --> 05:53.152
- I was more talkin' to Hitch.
- B'ys he's right rotted, he is.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.188
Like, Dolo, if anything,
I would have thought that you'd

05:55.188 --> 05:57.223
be the one the gay guys wanted
from the calendar.

05:57.223 --> 05:58.891
- True.
- My guy, is it really

05:58.891 --> 06:00.626
that big a deal Frankie
gets his own calendar?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.495
- Well, Sanger, look at him.
- Yeah.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.863
- Now look at him.
- Settle down.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.431
- Even him a little bit.
- Okay.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.300
Now look at him.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.102
Yeah.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.637
Oh, it's just gays
were saying how gay you looked

06:11.637 --> 06:13.172
- in the calendar, Frankie.
- Huh?

06:13.172 --> 06:14.941
Ain't no one tell ya
how gay ya looked?

06:14.941 --> 06:16.609
Let's let Frankie have
his day with the gays.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.877
You ever been to Provincetown?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.912
Well ya best come out
de other end of 'er.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.448
San Fran's a dump.
(Pam): Nice band tee.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.717
- I Mother Earth, eh, Hitch?
- Pamsky!

06:24.717 --> 06:26.486
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- "Scenery and Fish"

06:26.486 --> 06:30.890
might be the best Canadian
record of the genre, or the era.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.558
No, it's Rusty, "Fluke".

06:32.558 --> 06:34.560
Honourable mention,
Sloan, "One Chord to Another"?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.562
Oh, so we're just gonna
stand here and then pretend

06:36.562 --> 06:37.997
that "Jagged Little Pill"
never happened.

06:37.997 --> 06:42.001
Pam, you wanna come over
some time, play some tunes?

06:42.001 --> 06:44.771
I know what sluts
listen to, Hitch.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.976
You know, I could let this
bother me but I'm not gonna.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.845
- There you go, my man.
- 'Cause we gotta focus
on the Yanks.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.348
Let's get focused in here, boys.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.749
Everybody focusin'
in here now.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.151
Let's get on the go!

06:58.618 --> 07:00.820
Enough about the calendar,
boys, let's get focused!

07:00.820 --> 07:02.355
Not one more word about it.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.824
(Cory): That calendar's gonna
follow you around for the rest

07:04.824 --> 07:05.958
of your life, you dumb fuck!

07:05.958 --> 07:07.260
Where'd it all go
wrong, Shoresy?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.661
Well, it's the good thing
about reffing

07:08.661 --> 07:10.029
your beer league, boys,
at least I see

07:10.029 --> 07:11.330
it can get much worse.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.099
Yeah, did ya tuck your dick
back between your legs

07:13.099 --> 07:14.333
- for that, too?
- Doesn't matter, Cory,

07:14.333 --> 07:16.035
your mom will still find
a way to grab it.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.004
Don't worry, bud.
Your spray tan mid-December

07:18.004 --> 07:19.639
in Northern Ontario
didn't stand out at all.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.007
- Glad to hear, Liam!
- Don't worry,

07:21.007 --> 07:22.341
no one's calling
ya Jersey Shoresy.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.343
Did it get weird at all,
havin' one of the boys

07:24.343 --> 07:25.678
- grease you up?
- Nope.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.213
No? Didn't think,
what have I been doing

07:27.213 --> 07:28.915
with broads all these years?
This is terrific.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.483
Well, it's only gay
if you get hard.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.318
- Oh yeah?
- Isn't that what
you told me, Cor?

07:32.318 --> 07:33.753
- What?
- Hey, didn't you tell me

07:33.753 --> 07:35.421
if you keep your socks on,
it's not gay?

07:35.421 --> 07:36.622
- Something like that?
- Fuck you, Shoresy.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.057
(whistle toots)
Dogshit call.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.459
- Fuck you.
- The Yanks are comin'

07:39.459 --> 07:41.627
- for that record, Shoresy.
- Liam can you just hurry up

07:41.627 --> 07:43.796
and finish this game?
Your mom's still waiting for me

07:43.796 --> 07:45.431
to come back with a warm,
wet towel.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.300
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Liam!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.535
Your mom carved her initials
into my bedframe.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.671
How am I supposed to explain
that to Cory's mom?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.873
- Fuck you, Shoresy!
- Fuck you, Cory!

07:53.873 --> 07:55.808
Your mom's texts are so full
of spelling mistakes

07:55.808 --> 07:58.244
I can barely figure out what
time she wants me to come over.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.546
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Liam, did you know your mom

08:00.546 --> 08:01.914
calls her mitt her wet wallet?

08:01.914 --> 08:04.150
- (Cory and Liam): Fuck you!
- Boys, just tell your moms

08:04.150 --> 08:05.485
to leave me alone.
I'm not gettin'

08:05.485 --> 08:06.853
matching tattoos with them.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.988
Hope the Yanks fuckin'
toss you, Shoresy!

08:08.988 --> 08:12.024
(Shoresy): Not worried
about the Yanks, boys.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.359
I'm worried about
the Yanks, boys.

08:13.359 --> 08:16.062
Nat, you're a wee bit up
my ass about the Yanks.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.930
They've been right there
with us all year.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.866
- They're big, they're fast.
- They battle.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.602
- They love scoring goals.
- We're bigger. We're faster.

08:22.602 --> 08:23.936
We're 3-0 against 'em.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.304
Don't count
your chickens, slut.

08:25.304 --> 08:28.074
They're skilled
but they're scrappy, too.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.709
They get into those
dirty areas,

08:29.709 --> 08:31.611
- they dig those pucks out.
- They muck it up.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.179
They fucking
love scoring goals.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.247
Sounds like one of 'em

08:34.247 --> 08:35.515
might've given ya's
a good twattin'.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
But it's not their skill
I'm worried about.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.718
It's their will.

08:38.718 --> 08:40.353
(whistle screeches)
Sure, the Euros are gonna

08:40.353 --> 08:41.988
take it the odd time,
but the real battle

08:41.988 --> 08:44.790
for hockey supremacy,
best versus best,

08:44.790 --> 08:46.893
is between the Americans
and the Canadians.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.028
The men's game,

08:49.028 --> 08:51.564
the women's game,

08:51.564 --> 08:53.065
kids.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.469
Canada's the best
country at hockey.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.804
But the Yanks are right there.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.973
I think one of 'em
got Nat right in the twat.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.642
Americans have to be
the best at everything.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.277
- They're obsessed with it.
- And we're the only thing

09:04.277 --> 09:06.312
standing in the way from them
being the best at this.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.248
Which brings us to my point
of apprehension.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.384
They wanna be the best
fuckin' bad.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.219
First, they started
sending their kids

09:13.219 --> 09:16.289
to hockey schools up here.
Get their players on our level.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.125
Now the programs are just
as good down there. Some better.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.227
(Shoresy): I oughta wash
your mouth out with soap!

09:21.227 --> 09:23.095
(Nat): Shattuck, the National
Development Program,

09:23.095 --> 09:26.065
Total Package Hockey.
The average American player

09:26.065 --> 09:28.100
is just as good
as the average Canadian now.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.002
- Some better.
- Well, Notre Dame

09:30.002 --> 09:31.370
and Sasky made Wendel Clark.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.972
They'll never make one
of him down south.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.675
May never make one
of him again. Anywhere.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.009
Ain't that sum'in.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.579
I can't even say Wendel's
name without...

09:39.579 --> 09:40.913
gettin' a bit choked up.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.915
- I've got a Kleenex.
- Use your tampon, Shoresy.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.252
- Fuck you, Ziig! You fuckin'--
- There's pride on the line.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.887
Yeah, you're fuckin'
right there is!

09:47.887 --> 09:49.388
Our boys have focus issues.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.390
Well, it's senior
whale shit hockey.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.892
(both): Senior Triple A.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.560
Kee-he-he-he!

09:54.560 --> 09:56.829
The Soo Hunt will be coming
land, sea, and air.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.364
I want that fuckin'
record, Nat!

09:58.364 --> 09:59.999
If we lose it
with three games left--

09:59.999 --> 10:03.002
- We'll never lose again.
- Good.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.905
Yo, why are the Jims
always late?

10:05.905 --> 10:08.240
(indistinct shouting)

10:08.240 --> 10:11.677
What Manitoba town is famous
for guided polar bear tours?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.245

- The Indian Posse.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.659
(inmate): What town in Prince
Edward Island is also the name

10:26.659 --> 10:28.027
of a brand of french fries?

10:28.027 --> 10:30.162
- (buzzer rings)
- Cavendish.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.632

10:52.618 --> 10:54.754
(inmate): This Nunavut town

10:54.754 --> 10:56.555
continually inhabited
place on earth.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.591
(buzzer rings)
(Phil): Alert.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.060
Hey guys, wanna go to Kinhao?

11:01.594 --> 11:04.930
Huh? Let's get some
fuckin' seafood udon.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.670
(French rap music plays)

11:12.772 --> 11:14.440
Did you have two
of 'em in there?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.475
Fuckin' right!

11:17.043 --> 11:18.544
Fuckin' right!

11:18.544 --> 11:20.046
Settle down.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.714
But they're not gonna
be here tomorrow.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.450
Well, it's gonna be pretty
tough to focus on the Yanks

11:24.450 --> 11:26.118
when you're lookin' at boobies.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.687
Like, it's no wonder
you never have any legs

11:27.687 --> 11:29.889
in the third, you already played
a period between the sheets.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.624
Let's get some focus
goin' in here, boys.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.559
Let's have some
focus in here now!

11:42.501 --> 11:44.737
Did you have two
of 'em in there, too?

11:44.737 --> 11:47.139
- Wanna go to Buzzy Brown's?
- Fuckin' right!

11:47.139 --> 11:48.741
The chicken wings
are unbelievable.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.009
Yew-hew!

11:51.343 --> 11:53.479
- What're ya at?
- What are you doin'?

11:53.479 --> 11:55.381
Lard Jeezus, b'y,
de b'ys both had two girls

11:55.381 --> 11:57.016
- where they're to.
- What were you doin' in there?

11:57.016 --> 11:59.318
- (Shoresy): Huh?
- I was just listenin'.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.921
Well, I was bein' real quiet
so you wouldn't

12:01.921 --> 12:04.190
know where I was to.
I'm real proud o' ya, though,

12:04.190 --> 12:05.858
for doin' so good
as what you did.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.662
Ah no, she don't even know
me name, b'y.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.297
Lookin' for sum'in
a little deeper than that.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.632
- Let's have some toast.
- Let's just...

12:13.632 --> 12:15.568
get it outta your systems now.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.870
It's gonna be pretty tough
to focus on the Yanks

12:17.870 --> 12:19.505
when we're looking at--

12:24.143 --> 12:25.644
...vergina.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.848
(rap music plays)

12:32.752 --> 12:34.386
(Ziig): You're on the clock, slut.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.288
Does he look gay enough?

12:36.288 --> 12:38.390
I dunno. Does he look
gay enough, Ziig?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.459
The bears think he looks
good and gay naturally.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.794
I don't think
we should coach him.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.195
(knocking on door)

12:44.864 --> 12:45.965
Who's that?

12:46.665 --> 12:49.135
Oui, allo, Lysandre Nadeau.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.808
Who's that?

12:55.808 --> 12:57.910
(Miig): That is Rêve.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.646
(music intensifies)

13:01.781 --> 13:03.182
How does he do it?

13:03.182 --> 13:05.317
(Miig): The Quebecois
stand by their own.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.653
He's fucking up again.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.955
Frankie!

13:09.955 --> 13:11.957
(Nat exhales, annoyed)

13:13.125 --> 13:15.694
(upbeat rock music plays)

13:15.694 --> 13:17.730
(Alice giggles)

13:20.432 --> 13:22.101
(Fish): Fuck.
(Alice): What?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.469
Shoresy.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.539
- Hey, Fish!
- Shoresy.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.207
- You guys on a date?
- First date.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.375
- Nice!
- Yep.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.509
- Yeah.
- Yep.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.444
What the fuck do you think
you're doin'?

13:32.444 --> 13:33.612
- What? What?
- Huh?

13:33.612 --> 13:35.080
Well, you stopped scorin'
a goal a game

13:35.080 --> 13:36.615
but you got lots of time
for chit-chats.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.384
- Are you serious?
- Wish I had more time

13:38.384 --> 13:40.653
- for chit-chats.
- Shoresy, I'm third
on the team in points.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.354
Oh yeah? How many'd
ya score last game?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.689
- Zero. Zero.
- Huh?

13:43.689 --> 13:48.093
- And the game before that?
- Zero.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.962
But ya got lots
of time for chit-chats!

13:49.962 --> 13:52.064
- How's Goody?
- What happened to senior

13:52.064 --> 13:53.165
whale shit hockey?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.433
(Michaels): It used to be

13:54.433 --> 13:55.968
senior whale shit hockey.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.904
Now it's somethin' different.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.273
Now we have a chance
to do something

14:01.273 --> 14:02.675
that's never been done before.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.343
Think about it, Fish!

14:04.343 --> 14:06.879
You wanna be the best team
in the league this year,

14:06.879 --> 14:09.715
or do you wanna be the best
team in the league, ever?

14:11.951 --> 14:13.652
Yeah.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.022
What the fuck 're you doin'?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.257
- What?
- Huh?

14:18.257 --> 14:20.092
- I'm eating a panini.
- By yourself?

14:20.092 --> 14:21.827
- Yeah.
- In the middle of
the afternoon?

14:21.827 --> 14:23.996
- Is that not okay?
- Well, depends who you ask.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.931
- What do you mean?
- Well, if it was me sittin'

14:25.931 --> 14:27.800
there eatin' solo paninis
in the middle of the afternoon,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.134
I might be a little bit worried.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.237
- Worried about what?
- That I'm a fuckin' loser!

14:31.237 --> 14:33.505
For Chr--
Shoulda just got this to go.

14:33.505 --> 14:36.141
Well, you'd still be
by yourself eatin' paninis.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.012
- I see.
- Got a dip?

14:40.412 --> 14:42.014
(Palmer): Let's go!

14:44.984 --> 14:46.752
- I'll tell ya what, Shoresy?
- That's all right.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.188
Just so you know, people
are sayin' you're acting weird.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.757
- What do you say?
- Goalies are always weird!

14:51.757 --> 14:54.326
(footsteps thudding
rhythmically)

15:02.134 --> 15:03.802
You're right, Shoresy.
You know, solo paninis

15:03.802 --> 15:05.337
in the middle of
the afternoon is a bad--

15:05.337 --> 15:06.872
Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.074
They're in a day early, huh?

15:09.808 --> 15:12.344
It's a bit overkill.
It's senior whale shit hockey.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.813
(Nat): Not to them, it isn't.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.982
To these dudes, this is it.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.217
(Shoresy): The fuck
are they doin'?

15:18.217 --> 15:19.485
- Peak perfor--
- Huh?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.186
- Peak performance imagery.
- What?

15:21.186 --> 15:24.089
Visualization, my dude.
Gettin' mentally prepared.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.392
I told you they'd be coming
land, sea, and air.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.626
Simmer down.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.962
So, while our guys
are out there thinking about ass

15:29.962 --> 15:32.264
- and Reach For The Top--
- Goody loves chicken.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.434
The Soo Hunt are here.
Thinking about beating us.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.773
(rhythmic music plays)

15:49.181 --> 15:50.582
Get a life.

15:50.582 --> 15:51.717
See anyone you
don't recognize?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.953
Well, I see three guys
I've never seen

15:53.953 --> 15:55.854
with the Soo Hunt before

15:55.854 --> 15:57.756
and I recognize
all three of 'em.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.191
Yep, they loaded up.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.560
- Is that Matt Delaney?
- That's him.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.029
First round pick.
Three years in the show,

16:04.029 --> 16:06.131
three stints in the Players
Assistance Program.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.633
(Sanguinet): Do we know
what for?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.068
(Shoresy): Yep.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.836
That's Brady Schnurr.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.973
(Nat): 1,000 games in the show.
Another couple hundred

16:13.973 --> 16:15.874
in the minors,
and now he's here.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.078
(Shoresy): Hang 'em up.
(Nat): Veteran presence.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.546
Dale Palmer.

16:21.213 --> 16:22.881
(Shoresy): Could see
that guy from the moon.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.350
(Nat): Half a season
in the show.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.951
No one would fight
him so he quit.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.286
(Shoresy): Fuckin' loser.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.388
They wanna spoil
this for us so bad,

16:29.388 --> 16:31.056
they came in a day early
to get focused.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.192
I bet their broads couldn't
wait to get rid of 'em.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.960
Americans have to be
the best at everything.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.362
They're obsessed with it.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.297
