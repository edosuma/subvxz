WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.191
- Previously, on Being Human...

00:03.300 --> 00:05.792
- We've been hunting
the vampires,

00:05.830 --> 00:08.595
to fulfill the will of nature
and finish them off.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.063
- Aidan is a good man.
- He needs to be stopped.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.932
- Those crazy-ass dogs
scratched the hell out of me.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.540
- She should stay with us,
just through her first turn.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.173
- I'm a reanimated corpse

00:18.210 --> 00:20.941
brought back from the dead
by a spell, but I'm cursed.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.517
So anyone [ see that knew me
when I was alive dies.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.451
I have a job now.
It's at a funeral home.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.788
Max is a good boss.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.549
- How does a 15-year-old
just vanish?

00:30.590 --> 00:32.399
- Maybe Erin doesn't
wanna be found.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.354
- I have something for you.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.665
- Kenny's been stuck in that
cage since he was a toddler.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.634
Bubble-boy disease.
- Taking some blood.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.365
- Are you a vampire?
- No.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.509
- (Sally): Oh my God!

00:48.540 --> 00:50.042
(Chuckles)

00:55.850 --> 00:57.386
Oh my God!

00:57.420 --> 00:58.945
(Giggling)

00:58.990 --> 01:01.459
That's the best French toast
I've ever had.

01:01.490 --> 01:02.560
- Oh yeah?

01:02.590 --> 01:04.854
The secret is I use
heavy cream instead of milk,

01:04.890 --> 01:06.494
so the batter's
basically custard.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.157
- Mmm! It's basically amazing.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.463
- Yeah.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.130
- And you're an amazing man
for bringing it into my life.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.564
- Um...

01:17.610 --> 01:20.807
So, listen, I'm really glad
you guys are happy,

01:20.840 --> 01:24.105
but could we maybe try

01:24.150 --> 01:26.175
not to burn the house down?

01:26.220 --> 01:29.110
It's my only request.
- Oh no! Not the French toast!

01:29.150 --> 01:30.288
- Yes!

01:30.320 --> 01:31.981
- Hey, listen,
your girlfriend

01:32.020 --> 01:34.284
has been in the bathroom
for 45 minutes.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.482
Could you let her know
there is a line?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.123
- No, Nora's at work.
It's Erin.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.230
Hey, you're bathing!

01:39.260 --> 01:41.149
Does that mean you're
going back to work?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.167
- OK...

01:42.200 --> 01:43.668
No, it doesn't mean...

01:43.700 --> 01:46.294
I can't go back there.
Kenny saw me...

01:46.340 --> 01:49.207
- I know this is not your thing,
but you have to try this.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.639
It's kind of
life-changing.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.037
- My 2nd secret is I put
orange zest in the batter.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.138
- Aha!

01:54.180 --> 01:55.909
- (Sally):
Orange zest! What?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.217
- Dude, you need to streamline
your showering process.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.550
- Gotta keep it fresh.
FYI, the drain's clogged.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.219
It wasn't me!

02:12.300 --> 02:15.395
- Wow! I think my teeth
just rotted out of my head

02:15.430 --> 02:16.465
watching you do that.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.264
- Oh, don't...

02:18.300 --> 02:20.291
- Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop!

02:20.340 --> 02:21.637
That's communal cream.

02:22.670 --> 02:24.069
(Doorbell buzzing)

02:24.110 --> 02:25.566
- I'll get it!

02:27.010 --> 02:28.739
- God, how did she
get to be so cute?

02:28.780 --> 02:30.248
- Black magic.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.964
You can just tell them you
already have a religion, Sally.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.106
- Hide me... now.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.201
It's my brother.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.675
- What? Is it gonna
kill him to see you?

03:03.710 --> 03:04.848
What?

03:17.490 --> 03:20.721
- So, yeah, I'm your
new landlord, Robbie.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.762
My dad owns the house.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.759
He inherited it after
the last owners died.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.378
- Well, that is
indeed the deed...

03:35.940 --> 03:39.877
to the house
owned by Samid Malik.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.945
- Yeah, Dad was
happy to let

03:41.980 --> 03:44.688
the management company
handle everything,

03:44.720 --> 03:48.384
but I just got back to Boston,
so I'm gonna take over.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.797
- That's great because--
- The plumbing is shot to hell.

03:53.830 --> 03:55.150
And something
died in there.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.020
- Crawled into the wall
and kicked it.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.595
- The smell's
been overpowering.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.132
- If you have a SARS mask,

04:00.170 --> 04:02.502
you can come on in and
check it out right now.

04:02.540 --> 04:05.510
- If it's no problem,
I'll take care of it this week.

04:05.540 --> 04:06.871
- Great.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.379
- And seeing as how
I'm taking over,

04:09.410 --> 04:12.004
you can just write the
rent cheques directly to me.

04:12.050 --> 04:14.678
You know, or cash works too.
It's better actually.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.613
Pleasure meeting you, boys.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.125
- God...

04:28.160 --> 04:30.162
Robbie's not
supposed to be here.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.225
- I didn't even know
you had a brother.

04:32.270 --> 04:34.568
- Uh, yeah.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.365
Well, he doesn't even know
I'm in Boston and, uh,

04:37.410 --> 04:39.060
I need to
keep it that way.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.602
- You know what?
I'm just gonna meet you at work.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.041
'Cause I need to talk
this over with the guys.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.118
- Hey, are we in a fight
that I don't know about?

04:47.150 --> 04:48.948
- What? No, we're fine.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.389
If you see him,

04:51.420 --> 04:55.209
don't say anything to him
about me when you leave, OK?

04:55.260 --> 04:57.683
If he asks, you don't
even know me at all.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.791
- Right, I don't know you.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.468
Got it.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.810
- (Josh): OK, so your dad
owns the house,

05:09.840 --> 05:12.502
but you brother is now
the new landlord.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.872
Well, this is an
unanticipated turn of events.

05:14.910 --> 05:17.174
- Danny and I
were both on the deed,

05:17.210 --> 05:18.803
but he didn't have
any family left,

05:18.850 --> 05:21.171
so the property must have
reverted back to my dad

05:21.220 --> 05:22.176
when Danny died.

05:22.220 --> 05:24.143
- Well, Robbie seems...

05:25.390 --> 05:26.619
nice.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.828
- Yeah?
- (Aidan): Yeah.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.328
(Sighs)

05:32.360 --> 05:34.021
- I guess he's grown up.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.868
He was always
really handy.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.720
He was just, like,
so messed up!

05:38.770 --> 05:42.070
The last time I saw him
was at my prom.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.035
He got arrested for
stealing a tank of nitrous

05:45.070 --> 05:47.801
and selling hits in
the school parking lot.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.477
- P-people change.

05:48.510 --> 05:49.443
- People do change.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.574
- Well, his fight was
always with my mom.

05:51.610 --> 05:53.647
So my dad probably
just gave him the job

05:53.680 --> 05:56.274
to bring him back home.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.685
- You know, Sally,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.859
we tried to
get rid of him,

05:59.890 --> 06:01.949
but he's gonna come back
to make repairs.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.255
And to be honest, the place
does need a little TLC.

06:05.290 --> 06:06.894
- This is a death sentence
for him.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.126
How am I supposed
to avoid contact?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.719
- Maybe I can call your dad?

06:10.770 --> 06:13.091
- Do not call my dad!
I don't wanna risk his life!

06:13.140 --> 06:15.438
- I wasn't suggesting that.
- Hold on.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.064
- Just don't call my dad.
- Well, here's the plan.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.305
- Listen to him.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.808
- Here it is. Ready?

06:20.840 --> 06:23.775
The three of us are gonna stay
home all day, fix the place up.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.279
So when Robbie comes back,
he'll just be in and out.

06:26.310 --> 06:30.315
- Josh, I cannot stay here.
What if he comes back today?

06:30.350 --> 06:32.489
Besides, I have work.
- And I got work.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.079
- So now you have
to go to work?

06:34.120 --> 06:36.384
- Fine, you're right.
No, I should skip it.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.649
- No, go.
No! You should go.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.828
No, you should go.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.589
It's gonna be good
to have you back.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.894
- I have a ski mask.
Do you need the ski mask?

06:43.930 --> 06:45.591
- That sounds great.
Thank you.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.064
- You'll sneak out after me.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.534
- Yes. Also though, guys,

06:48.570 --> 06:50.959
if Robbie's gonna be here
when we're gone,

06:51.010 --> 06:54.230
you're probably gonna wanna
just lock up your valuables.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.770
Just in case.

06:58.610 --> 06:59.918
(Sighs)

07:07.390 --> 07:08.710
- Hey, champ! You hungry?

07:08.760 --> 07:11.525
- I haven't seen you
in a while.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.962
- Oh, you know,
pediatrics just got

07:17.000 --> 07:20.129
an Atari 7800 donated
a couple of days ago.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.865
And if you want, I can scrub it
and sneak it in here.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.504
And I know what
you're thinking.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.908
But you should try retro.
You might actually like it.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.704
(Air hissing)

07:28.740 --> 07:30.947
I had jury duty.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.347
- Uh, Kerwin said
you were sick.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.077
- Uh, yeah, I was sick,
and then I did my civic duty.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.339
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, wait, wait!

07:38.390 --> 07:42.258
Um, are we gonna talk about
the fact that you're a vampire?

07:44.430 --> 07:47.229
Look, I'm not gonna, like,
tweet it or anything.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.623
- (Sighing): OK.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.332
Let's just say,
for sake of argument,

07:54.370 --> 07:55.690
that I'm a vampire.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.607
What's to stop me from
chowing down right now?

08:01.710 --> 08:03.041
The glass?

08:03.080 --> 08:05.879
These aren't the shields to
the Starship Enterpris Kenny.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.719
I can break through glass.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.344
- OK, well, if...

08:10.390 --> 08:12.711
If you were evil,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.387
you would have
eaten me already.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.889
And I know that you've
been drawing extra blood.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.329
- And I apologize for that,

08:18.360 --> 08:20.294
but I don't schedule
the tests, pal.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.992
- OK, so before you,
you know,

08:23.030 --> 08:26.364
dismiss me or glamour me
or whatever,

08:26.400 --> 08:27.890
let me feed you.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.270
(Sighs)

08:40.080 --> 08:41.342
- She's a runaway.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.212
Where did she get
so many clothes?

08:43.250 --> 08:44.945
(Clanging)

08:47.490 --> 08:49.458
Aidan?

08:49.490 --> 08:51.652
Why aren't you at work?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.867
You know,
if you're getting fired,

08:57.900 --> 09:00.938
the least you can do is man up
and help me snake the drain.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.268
And I really hope
you're wearing pants.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.778
- Oh, hey.

09:10.010 --> 09:12.342
- What are you doing
down here, Erin?

09:12.380 --> 09:15.941
- Sorry, I was just thinking
about where to, uh...

09:16.950 --> 09:19.920
change next time.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.416
- Oh.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.821
You don't have to
worry about that.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.329
I'll get you a storage unit
next to Nora, OK?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.829
- Can't we just do it
in the woods again??

09:29.870 --> 09:33.431
That storage place is, like,
dog-pound level depressing.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.598
- So you'd rather
get killed in an alley?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.301
Or better yet,
kill someone else?

09:37.340 --> 09:39.434
- Just because you couldn't
control yourself,

09:39.470 --> 09:40.471
doesn't mean I can't.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.274
You're not a wolf anymore.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.449
Stop acting like you know
what's best for me.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.244
- I do know what's
best for you, Erin.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.817
And when you're in this house,
you will listen to me.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.046
That means you will change
in the storage unit,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.615
you will respect
people's privacy

09:52.660 --> 09:54.014
and you'll go upstairs and
you'll tidy up your stuff.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.655
The living room
iS common space.

09:57.690 --> 10:00.728
And I've turned
into my mother.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.370
(Horn honking, birds chirping)

10:16.850 --> 10:18.079
- Hey, handsome.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.717
That suit makes death
look sexy.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.219
- Thanks.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.254
The Dobbins viewing is
starting in a half hour.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.224
- Oh yeah, that's more
than enough time.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.457
- OK, all right, so the stuff
with your brother,

10:33.500 --> 10:34.922
that's OK?

10:34.960 --> 10:37.224
- If by "OK" you mean
super messed up,

10:37.270 --> 10:38.897
then, yeah, it's good.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.396
It's all right.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.061
It's fine.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.132
- OK.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.910
- Although, it doesn't
seem really practical

10:56.950 --> 11:00.659
for me to go full
Anne Frank at home, so...

11:01.660 --> 11:04.527
could I stay with you
for a day or two?

11:04.560 --> 11:05.823
- I guess.

11:06.860 --> 11:09.192
- Is something else
bothering you?

11:09.230 --> 11:12.939
Mr. Dobbins is starting to look
a little RuPaul's Drag Race.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.601
- How come you can talk
to your roommates,

11:20.640 --> 11:21.937
but you can't talk to me?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.642
I mean,
we're close physically.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.909
But I really wanna
know you, Sally.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.076
- You do know me.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.144
- Yeah, I mean,

11:29.180 --> 11:31.217
I know that you
like French toast,

11:31.250 --> 11:33.116
you know, like,
an unnatural amount.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.310
You either have the
world's highest metabolism

11:35.360 --> 11:38.182
or you have a very
well-hidden eating disorder.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.652
(Both chuckle)

11:39.690 --> 11:43.399
I know that you look
amazing in purple

11:43.430 --> 11:46.525
and I know that you love it
when I kiss you behind the ear.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.060
I know that you were
terrified to go outside,

11:48.100 --> 11:49.397
but I have no idea why.

11:54.010 --> 11:58.504
- There are just some things
I can't ask you to deal with.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.315
- But you can talk to Josh
and Aidan about them?

12:01.350 --> 12:03.341
They're just
your roommates, right?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.846
So why are you guys
so close?

12:04.890 --> 12:08.019
- Aidan and Josh just...

12:08.060 --> 12:10.722
understand what
I'm going through.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.752
- OK, so, obviously, you've got
some weird stuff going on.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.519
You know, I was
a 28-year-old virgin.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.097
I know all about baggage,
but I can talk about mine.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.291
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.796
- We can't even
go out to dinner

12:21.840 --> 12:24.366
because you're worried about
seeing someone you know.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.538
How can we have
any kind of life?

12:26.570 --> 12:28.299
(Sighs)

12:28.340 --> 12:30.877
- I like what we have, Max.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.779
It'll get better,
I promise.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.114
I promise.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.954
(Siren)

12:41.990 --> 12:43.685
- Aidan, I have
been up all night

12:43.730 --> 12:45.482
thinking of questions
to ask you.

12:45.530 --> 12:46.679
- I'm shocked.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.721
- Come on!
I saw you change.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.091
The eyes and the teeth.

12:50.130 --> 12:52.224
Come on, you can't
keep denying that.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.090
If you do, I can
always tell Kerwin...

12:54.140 --> 12:55.369
who might
think I'm crazy.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.868
<i>But she also
might believe me.</i>

12:58.510 --> 13:00.376
(Sighs)

13:00.410 --> 13:02.071
Please.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.387
- What do you wanna know?
- Yes!

13:12.420 --> 13:15.151
OK, OK, OK. Um...

13:15.190 --> 13:17.079
Are you, like,
a thousand years old?

13:18.430 --> 13:21.058
- More like 260,
give or take.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.659
Arm.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.192
- See, and you don't look
a day over 225.

13:25.230 --> 13:26.561
- Thank you.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.068
- Can you step over to
the sunlight one more time?

13:28.100 --> 13:31.468
- Why?
- I wanna see if you sparkle.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.501
- Listen to me.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.770
It's not like it is
in the movies.

13:35.810 --> 13:39.405
There is absolutely nothing
glamorous about what I am.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.009
OK?

13:41.050 --> 13:42.472
- Why me though?

13:42.520 --> 13:43.988
I mean, is, like,

13:44.020 --> 13:46.739
immunodeficiency blood
some type of delicacy?

13:46.790 --> 13:50.624
- There's this virus,
and it's a flu.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.493
And for humans,
it's a couple days of chills,

13:53.530 --> 13:55.953
but the antibodies
that it leaves behind

13:56.000 --> 13:57.365
are lethal to vampires.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.664
- And I, of course,
didn't catch it.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.635
That's it?

14:02.670 --> 14:04.729
Come on, you can
take one for yourself.

14:04.770 --> 14:05.840
I can feed you.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.175
(Sighs)

14:10.210 --> 14:11.769
I don't, uh...

14:11.810 --> 14:15.269
I don't meet many
cool people in here,

14:15.320 --> 14:17.880
believe it or not,
undead or otherwise.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.218
And I just would hate
to lose a friend

14:20.260 --> 14:23.025
because he was too proud
to accept a favour.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.397
- OK, m-maybe just
a little bit.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.632
- How--how did you
become a vampire?

14:37.910 --> 14:40.038
- I didn't have a choice.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.340
Well, we won the battle,
no thanks to you.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.779
You really had to get shot?

14:46.810 --> 14:49.211
- True soldiers take wounds
for their cause.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.550
- Just try not to be such
a willing target next time.

14:52.590 --> 14:53.751
- It's only a scratch.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.009
Sleep and a hot meal
would be the best medicine.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.688
- What I wouldn't give for one
of your wife's meat pies.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.255
- Why do you think
I married her?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.270
- Suzanna nearly starts a fire
every time she tries to cook.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.496
- But what a beauty! Ah!

15:05.530 --> 15:07.168
- Go seek help.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.170
I promised your girl you
would come home in one piece.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.861
Do not make a liar of me.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.503
- All right.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.235
I'll see you
back at camp.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.671
Oh, and, Aidan,
do some good for once

15:21.720 --> 15:24.587
and try to find us
something hot for supper.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.660
(Explosions)

15:30.690 --> 15:32.624
(Bird warbling)

15:50.250 --> 15:51.502
(Gasps)

15:51.550 --> 15:53.143
- S-sergeant! Sergeant!

16:24.850 --> 16:26.340
(Whooshing)

16:29.220 --> 16:31.143
(Panting)

16:36.990 --> 16:38.219
(Gasps)

16:40.600 --> 16:42.159
(Growling)

16:44.500 --> 16:45.865
- Oh!

16:49.740 --> 16:51.265
(Laughing)

16:53.640 --> 16:55.039
(Aidan grunting)

16:59.510 --> 17:00.909
- You are a brave one.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.749
Most men would have run,
not followed me.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.589
- What sort of monster are you?
- Am I a monster?

17:08.619 --> 17:10.759
- Whatever you are,

17:10.790 --> 17:13.919
you will die for
dishonouring those soldiers.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.306
(Breathing heavily)

17:38.120 --> 17:39.940
(Groaning)

17:55.040 --> 17:58.362
- Your troops are camped
about half a mile from here.

17:59.570 --> 18:01.937
I can smell them.

18:01.980 --> 18:06.269
They're injured from battle,
weak from hunger,

18:06.310 --> 18:09.143
not expecting an attack
from one of their own.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.443
What's to keep me

18:10.490 --> 18:12.413
from slaughtering
them all like lambs?

18:12.450 --> 18:13.713
Certainly not you.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.114
- Let them go.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.514
(Gasping)

18:16.560 --> 18:18.221
Kill me instead.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.355
- I will.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.994
And all the men
who wait for you.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.564
- Oh God...

18:31.940 --> 18:33.578
Suzanna...

18:33.610 --> 18:36.329
- Did you really think you were
going to survive this war

18:36.380 --> 18:37.575
to return to them?

18:38.910 --> 18:42.949
You looked the Devil
in the eye and charged.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.187
Is there a quicker way
to get to Heaven?

18:45.220 --> 18:47.188
- It was right!
- It was foolhardy.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.381
- So spare me.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.959
Let me learn
from my mistake.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.196
- I will not spare you.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.339
But I could turn you
into what I am.

19:03.340 --> 19:07.174
You would be stronger,
more powerful.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.030
And you would live forever.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.978
You couldn't go home again.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.519
But you will not care.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.384
After a time,
you will not care.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.024
- I would rather die.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.858
- Then your men
will die today too.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.368
(Groaning)

19:32.470 --> 19:34.063
(Panting)

19:37.440 --> 19:39.761
- Let them live.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.518
- You must understand,

19:47.550 --> 19:49.939
what you believe,
what you love,

19:49.980 --> 19:53.416
it changes in
as many lifetimes.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.179
You will not be
the same man.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.630
- I am already changed.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.867
- Your choice, warrior.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.733
- Hey!

20:12.840 --> 20:14.376
Did you get this
from my room?

20:14.410 --> 20:18.108
- Why wouldn't you share it?
It's interesting and useful.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.074
- It's pointless to apply
science to a curse.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.987
Rehashing my failures won't
do you any good, Erin.

20:24.020 --> 20:24.987
I promise.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.488
- Right. What a drag.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.955
You'd rather lock me up
and forget about me.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.785
- I'm trying to help you!

20:31.830 --> 20:33.753
- Erin, remember when
you said that

20:33.800 --> 20:35.598
Bob Dylan is good music
for old people?

20:35.630 --> 20:37.621
Well, I have a turntable
and a bunch of LPs

20:37.670 --> 20:38.967
if you wanna
check them out.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.166
(* Chime on cell )

20:47.010 --> 20:48.330
- No, no.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.575
(Door closing)

20:49.610 --> 20:52.477
No, everything is so
My So-Called Life with her...

20:53.680 --> 20:55.478
but switchbladier.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.976
- You don't have to
adore her,

20:57.020 --> 20:59.239
just look out for her
like you do with Emily.

20:59.290 --> 21:01.884
- No, it was never
this hard with Emily.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.379
- Erin is just looking for
things to rebel against.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.491
Maybe just try to care
a little bit less.

21:09.530 --> 21:10.895
OK?

21:28.680 --> 21:30.079
(Gasps)

21:31.120 --> 21:33.384
- Sally? How are you here?

21:33.420 --> 21:34.956
- Robbie...

21:34.990 --> 21:36.617
- What the hell is this?

21:36.660 --> 21:37.889
- Oh my...

21:37.930 --> 21:40.456
I have to...
I have to fix this.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.219
I can't explain right now.
I don't have--

21:43.260 --> 21:46.195
I'm gonna come back here,
I promise, just...

21:51.840 --> 21:54.309
I love you.
I love you.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.830
- Sally!

21:58.850 --> 22:00.204
- Donna's not gonna be there.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.116
It's 2:00 a.m.
Normal people are in bed.

22:02.150 --> 22:04.585
- Since when is a black-magic
witch a normal person?

22:04.620 --> 22:06.110
- Why would you risk
going home

22:06.150 --> 22:08.187
if you thought Robbie
was gonna be around?

22:08.220 --> 22:10.188
- Normal people are in bed!
I don't know.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.928
What was Robbie doing camping
out on the street corner?

22:12.960 --> 22:14.394
I thought he'd
be at my dad's.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.728
Besides, I needed
to change my clothes.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.400
- Unacceptable to go 6 hours
without a wardrobe change.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.637
Honestly, if you see me
in yesterday's sweater,

22:21.670 --> 22:22.762
shoot me in the face.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.199
I don't wanna
live like that.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.439
- Um...

22:26.470 --> 22:27.676
Oh yeah! What about bats?

22:27.710 --> 22:29.235
Can you turn into one?
Or mist?

22:29.280 --> 22:31.544
Hey, what's the deal
with the wooden stakes?

22:31.580 --> 22:33.412
- Oh boy! Kenny...

22:35.280 --> 22:38.489
(Air hissing)

22:38.520 --> 22:39.749
Why don't you just
wear a spacesuit?

22:39.790 --> 22:41.758
John Travolta,
Boy in the Plastic Bubble.

22:41.790 --> 22:44.122
And that Seinfeld episode.
I sure learned a ton.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.583
- That set back bubble-boy
awareness 20 years.

22:46.630 --> 22:47.756
(Laughs)

22:47.800 --> 22:49.222
- I don't turn into a bat.

22:49.260 --> 22:50.466
- OK.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.389
Wait, wait, wait. Um...

22:52.430 --> 22:54.091
Can you, uh...

22:55.340 --> 22:57.069
Um...

22:58.110 --> 22:59.737
- What is it?

23:00.780 --> 23:03.306
- I want you to turn me...

23:03.340 --> 23:05.479
into what you are.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.184
(Gulps)

23:11.220 --> 23:13.348
- You don't know
what you're asking.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.920
(Birds chirping)

23:20.760 --> 23:23.320
(Gasps, panting)

24:01.470 --> 24:03.131
Ah!

24:03.170 --> 24:05.002
(Groans)

24:10.010 --> 24:11.648
(Insect chirring)

24:15.780 --> 24:17.919
(Chirping amplified)

24:34.040 --> 24:36.134
- (Bishop): Have you ever
felt more alive?

24:36.170 --> 24:37.160
(Gasps)

24:43.780 --> 24:46.806
- I have done
what you asked.

24:46.850 --> 24:50.844
And I shall return
to my men, to my life.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.313
- You are no
longer one of them.

24:53.350 --> 24:55.318
You are more than
what they are.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.351
- I don't care

24:57.390 --> 25:00.087
that you bit me.

25:00.130 --> 25:03.691
I owe it to my soldiers
to help them win this war.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.695
- Go, then.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.163
But you won't find friends.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.900
You'll find dinner.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.971
(Panting)

25:26.050 --> 25:28.087
- Aidan! Ha! You did
not return yesterday.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.281
I thought you'd run away.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.685
- I was on a scout.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.754
(Chuckles)

25:31.790 --> 25:33.383
- Glad to have you back.

25:37.730 --> 25:39.767
I was about to
bring this back to camp.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.929
Even shared, a bit of meat will
keep everyone's spirits up.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.575
(Heartbeat)

25:50.910 --> 25:52.469
(Echoing): Aidan.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.513
(Grunts)

25:57.550 --> 25:59.712
Aidan, what's wrong?

25:59.750 --> 26:01.457
- It--it is all right.

26:01.490 --> 26:02.582
- Aidan.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.054
- It is
all right.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.851
- Oh! Ah! Ah!

26:07.900 --> 26:10.221
- Do not be afraid,
Benjamin.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.092
(Grunting)

26:12.130 --> 26:14.667
Do not be afraid,
Benjamin.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.560
(Groans)

26:18.610 --> 26:20.635
(Heartbeat)

26:23.180 --> 26:25.740
(Gasping)

26:25.780 --> 26:27.771
(Heartbeat slowing to a stop)

26:29.750 --> 26:32.048
(Birds chirping)

26:40.800 --> 26:43.599
- Oh, it's you!

26:43.700 --> 26:45.725
Hey, you cleaned up OK!

26:45.770 --> 26:48.068
- Donna, we need your help.
My brother saw me.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.067
It was an accident.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.590
- You have to
change the deal.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.903
- You have
to save him!

26:51.940 --> 26:53.430
- I don't have to do anything.

26:53.470 --> 26:56.804
Besides, I can't.
The spell is binding.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.579
- Sally!
- Help him

27:05.620 --> 27:06.644
or I'll kill you.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.583
Aaah!

27:11.630 --> 27:14.019
(Grunting)

27:14.060 --> 27:15.357
(Speaking foreign language)

27:15.400 --> 27:16.822
- Sally, are you OK?

27:16.860 --> 27:18.794
(Foreign language)

27:20.230 --> 27:21.868
Sally!

27:23.740 --> 27:25.834
(Choking)

27:30.540 --> 27:31.575
(Grunts)

27:31.610 --> 27:32.577
Sally!

27:32.610 --> 27:34.476
(Grunting)

27:40.350 --> 27:41.681
- I gave you this life,

27:41.720 --> 27:43.654
but I am happy to
end it right now

27:43.690 --> 27:46.352
and send you back to
limbo where you belong.

27:46.390 --> 27:48.654
- Sally. Sally.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.919
(Both groan)

27:50.970 --> 27:52.369
(Sally gasping)

27:52.400 --> 27:54.789
- It is a delicate balance,
life, death.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.968
I've already pushed it,
bringing you back.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.139
You can't expect
to save his life without

27:59.170 --> 28:01.138
giving something else up
in its place.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.241
- Please. Please,
it's my brother.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.880
- There is one way.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.584
- Anything. Anything.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.145
- You would live out
your natural life.

28:13.190 --> 28:14.658
You could see the
people you used to know

28:14.690 --> 28:15.760
without consequences.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.519
- That's what I want.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.757
- But when you die,
I get your soul.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.760
- Sally, no. You ca--

28:23.800 --> 28:26.428
You can't give her
your soul! It's not worth it!

28:26.470 --> 28:28.461
- He's family, Josh.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.696
He's family.

28:35.710 --> 28:37.030
(Sniffles)

28:39.110 --> 28:43.672
If you can save my brother,
then you can have my soul.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.615
- You know, not many people
would sacrifice

28:47.650 --> 28:48.685
so much for someone else.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.812
You must love
him a lot.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.727
- You don't even know what
she's going to do with it.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.128
- I don't care. I'll deal
with my soul later.

28:56.160 --> 29:00.427
If Robbie dies now,
all he'll ever be is lost.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.063
I always thought
he was selfish,

29:02.100 --> 29:03.659
but if I let this
curse kill him

29:03.700 --> 29:06.010
because I'm afraid of
the unknown, I'm worse.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.678
I hurt a lot of people
running from that fear,

29:09.710 --> 29:11.644
and I never
wanna do it again.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.739
I'd rather live
the life I have,

29:13.780 --> 29:16.010
really live, than
waste it hiding,

29:16.050 --> 29:18.747
afraid of killing
the people that I love.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.884
That's worth an
eternity to me.

29:25.490 --> 29:28.096
- Just so that
we are clear...

29:31.170 --> 29:33.093
your brother
will be safe.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.962
(Crying)

29:35.000 --> 29:38.106
You will no longer Kkill
the people that you know

29:38.140 --> 29:40.131
by having contact
with them.

29:41.340 --> 29:45.277
But when you die,
your soul is mine.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.505
Is that what you want?

29:47.550 --> 29:48.620
(Sniffles)

29:48.650 --> 29:51.813
- Yes.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.818
Thank you.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.189
- You knew this
would happen.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.534
- What will you
do with it?

30:11.870 --> 30:14.202
My soul.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.880
- You no longer have
the right to know.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.455
(Bird chirping)

30:32.490 --> 30:34.026
(Car honking)

30:36.500 --> 30:38.969
- Hey, jerk.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.795
- Sally!

30:49.310 --> 30:50.539
- You look pale.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.049
- Yeah, I--

30:53.080 --> 30:56.539
I was a little out of it
earlier, but I'm OK now.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.446
Weird.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.946
- Yeah.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.583
- I thought
you were dead.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.487
Wasn't there a funeral?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.124
- Yeah, uh, it was
just this whole--

31:07.160 --> 31:10.653
It was the situation
with--with Danny and, uh,

31:10.700 --> 31:13.067
I just had to lay
low for a while.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.837
So Dad kicked you out?

31:16.870 --> 31:18.406
- Yeah.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.929
- So, I guess he didn't know

31:21.980 --> 31:24.506
about the whole
landlord thing, did he?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.143
- How'd you know about that?

31:26.180 --> 31:28.342
- These guys are my friends.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.020
(Church bells ringing
in distance)

31:39.160 --> 31:41.219
- I'm just passing
through Boston anyway.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.250
I'm going to Florida.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.189
Got a couple deals
there waiting for me.

31:44.230 --> 31:46.369
- Are you serious?
You were just scamming Dad

31:46.400 --> 31:48.892
after everything that
he's been through?

31:48.940 --> 31:52.103
- Dad doesn't want anything
to do with the house, all right?

31:52.140 --> 31:53.505
He was just letting
the cheques pile up.

31:53.540 --> 31:55.975
He would've never
even noticed.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.808
(Bird chirping)

32:03.480 --> 32:05.289
- You weren't at
Mom's funeral.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.879
- Neither were you.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.252
Pot call the kettle black much?

32:09.290 --> 32:11.019
Dad thinks you're dead,

32:11.060 --> 32:12.482
in case you forgot.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.725
- I know, Robbie.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.421
I know it's crazy,

32:15.460 --> 32:18.964
but please just don't
say anything to Dad.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.459
I just need to do
it my own way.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.537
- You were always
the good one.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.232
So if you had to lie,
you must've had a good reason.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.330
- Look, I have--

32:30.380 --> 32:32.371
I have, like...

32:33.550 --> 32:35.917
I don't know,
like, 60 bucks.

32:35.950 --> 32:37.987
Just take it.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.513
For gas money,
you know.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.459
- I guess I should
hit the road.

32:45.490 --> 32:49.654
- Maybe we can see each other
again next time you're in town.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.920
It's a new start, another
chance to do things right.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.460
- Yeah.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.598
- So, Florida, huh?

33:25.270 --> 33:27.295
Glad you're going
some place warm.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.560
- I'll write
you a postcard.

33:49.690 --> 33:50.987
(Chuckling)

33:51.020 --> 33:53.330
- Nothing like
sterilized comic books

33:53.360 --> 33:54.828
to start the
day out right.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.693
- Yeah, my dad dropped them off
on the way to work.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.596
- What did he
bring you this time?

33:59.630 --> 34:03.794
- Uh, just the usual pull list.
Plus the Whedon run of X-Men.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.865
- Wow!

34:05.910 --> 34:07.366
- Yeah.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.299
Uh, he's--he's the best.

34:09.340 --> 34:13.504
So, hey, I asked you
to turn me into a vampire.

34:13.550 --> 34:14.516
(Sighs)

34:14.550 --> 34:16.348
Why aren't we
talking about that?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.348
- We are.

34:20.820 --> 34:24.779
Kenny, if I were
to turn you...

34:26.630 --> 34:28.257
you could never
see your dad again.

34:30.030 --> 34:31.623
You would
have to leave

34:31.670 --> 34:34.889
everyone that
you love behind.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.804
- I turn 18 next year.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.906
The day after my birthday,

34:43.940 --> 34:45.647
I'm walking out of here.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.444
Whether you turn me or not.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.811
(Scoffs)

34:52.820 --> 34:54.379
Even if it kills me.

34:55.389 --> 34:56.789
'Cause this...

34:59.390 --> 35:00.619
It's not living.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.102
(Sniffling)

35:22.180 --> 35:25.241
- Why did you let me go?

35:25.290 --> 35:26.246
Why?

35:26.290 --> 35:29.419
(Both grunt)

35:29.460 --> 35:32.088
- Because now you know
you cannot go back.

35:32.130 --> 35:36.055
- (Crying): I would never make
that mistake again!

35:36.100 --> 35:37.852
- That is what
you say today,

35:37.900 --> 35:41.939
and you will say it as you hover
over countless lost causes.

35:41.970 --> 35:45.634
Former loves, family.

35:45.670 --> 35:48.059
With eternity at your side,
you will think

35:48.110 --> 35:50.772
that you will not
make that mistake again.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.870
But of course you will.

35:59.690 --> 36:00.839
- Sorry.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.585
Lost.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.349
- No enemies here, son.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.759
Come back.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.195
We were just
about to feast.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.765
It's all right.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.790
Come.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.699
(Aidan gasps)

36:25.750 --> 36:27.639
You must have dug up
quite an appetite.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.217
(Birds chirping)

36:44.060 --> 36:45.266
(Sighs)

36:46.400 --> 36:48.095
- (Liam): She cleaned up.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.419
- Hey, you.

37:14.260 --> 37:17.457
- Wasn't sure I was gonna
see you again.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.491
- That's not fair.

37:19.530 --> 37:20.429
- You ran home to
get clothes last night

37:20.470 --> 37:21.596
and never came back.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.606
Yeah, I--I really
like you, Sally, but...

37:29.680 --> 37:31.944
I just don't think
this is gonna work out.

37:37.050 --> 37:41.009
- I know that I have
been super crazy.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.916
But I've been
dealing with some stuff.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.122
Like, life and death stuff.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.527
And last night, I fixed it.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.551
- OK.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.829
- Wait, OK.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.294
My family hasn't always
been there for me,

37:54.340 --> 37:57.435
which is why I started a new
family with Aidan and Josh.

37:57.470 --> 37:59.302
And maybe with
you too, one day,

37:59.340 --> 38:01.672
if I haven't totally
messed this up.

38:01.710 --> 38:05.146
- Family doesn't just vanish
without so much as a text.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.012
- OK.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.559
All right.

38:17.590 --> 38:19.285
What if I...

38:19.330 --> 38:21.287
What if I gave you

38:21.330 --> 38:25.289
a ho-more-crazies
guarantee?

38:26.500 --> 38:27.626
(Chuckles)

38:27.670 --> 38:29.035
- Why should I believe you?

38:29.070 --> 38:30.367
- Because...

38:31.370 --> 38:33.407
we can go out
together now.

38:34.540 --> 38:35.769
On the town.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.676
- Like, to the movies?
- Yeah.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.303
- Or, like, the mall?
- Mm-hmm.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.772
- Or, like,
the discotheque?

38:40.810 --> 38:44.019
- Well, if you can locate
a discotheque in this decade,

38:44.050 --> 38:45.814
I will go with you.

38:45.850 --> 38:48.751
- I will find a discotheque.
- Well then, let's go to it.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.824
- OK. I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.924
But you have to do
something for me.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.961
- What?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.764
- Just go to breakfast with me.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.263
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

39:05.270 --> 39:07.364
- But, um...

39:07.410 --> 39:09.902
I just gave my last
$60 to my brother.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.275
I don't have any money.

39:13.310 --> 39:14.948
(Laughing)

39:14.980 --> 39:17.119
- So, oh... OK.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.710
So this is what they mean
by high-maintenance.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.047
- Mmm...

39:21.090 --> 39:22.285
(Chuckles)

39:41.010 --> 39:43.229
- (Liam):
And you can't forget...

39:47.350 --> 39:49.819
You're part
of my pack now.

39:49.850 --> 39:51.272
Just like Nora.

39:54.890 --> 39:57.416
You've been abandoned before,

39:57.460 --> 39:59.280
but that was by humans.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.300
A wolf's bond
goes deeper.

40:02.330 --> 40:04.719
You're not an orphan anymore.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.722
You're family.

40:07.770 --> 40:11.809
Now, he's gonna do whatever
he can to keep us apart.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.763
But since
you're a child,

40:13.810 --> 40:16.302
he'll be inclined
to trust you.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.808
** Everybody's living alone

40:19.850 --> 40:23.218
That makes you
my secret weapon.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.514
* Everything I hear
is the same *

40:25.550 --> 40:28.042
* The same, the same,
the same *

40:31.060 --> 40:33.279
- (Liam): You'll tell me
his schedule,

40:33.330 --> 40:35.549
find his food supply

40:35.600 --> 40:38.490
and then poison it
with your blood.

40:38.530 --> 40:41.124
I'll be there
to finish him.

40:54.210 --> 40:57.111
- (Erin): He's home early.
Come now.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.812
- Don't take your eyes off him.
I'm almost there.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.958
* 'Cause we are happy *

41:05.260 --> 41:09.629
* As we live in
an age of denial *

41:10.900 --> 41:13.699
* I still love you

41:13.730 --> 41:15.767
* For what it's worth *

41:17.270 --> 41:21.366
* As we sink in
an age of denial *

41:34.990 --> 41:37.209
* We must stay together

41:37.260 --> 41:40.025
* We must see it through

41:40.060 --> 41:43.792
* We're just in the middle

41:43.830 --> 41:46.595
* The middle of a sea

41:46.630 --> 41:48.166
(Panting)

41:48.200 --> 41:50.737
* Everybody wants
to say something new **

41:50.770 --> 41:52.329
(Gasping)

41:54.470 --> 41:56.905
(Coughing, wheezing)
