WEBVTT

00:04.333 --> 00:06.291
Well, I’ve been going through your files.

00:06.417 --> 00:07.667
And, uh...

00:07.750 --> 00:09.583
<i>I can tell you</i>

00:09.667 --> 00:11.500
you are one sick,

00:11.583 --> 00:12.959
twisted individual.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.583
How in the world did you get a donkey

00:15.667 --> 00:17.917
- into Ms. Sherman's car?
-

00:18.000 --> 00:19.125
The real question is

00:19.208 --> 00:20.792
how did I get it to drive?

00:24.750 --> 00:27.166
I’m not like the others, Jerry.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.291
You've met your match.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.375
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.625
Well, I posted what I did to you
on the Internet.

00:31.709 --> 00:33.375
It's got 14 million hits.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.834
Type in "Principal Wigs Out."

00:35.667 --> 00:37.291
Internet. Internet.

00:37.375 --> 00:38.583
What you did to me?

00:38.667 --> 00:40.041
This is a career-buster.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.250
I’m gonna turn on
the helicopter camera now.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.333
Get it.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.959
It's over, Jerry.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.291
Pack up your locker.

01:01.375 --> 01:04.250
You're going downtown to Charlie Brown!

01:06.333 --> 01:07.750
I don't even know what that means.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.000
You are expelled!

01:10.625 --> 01:11.458
What?

01:11.542 --> 01:13.834
- No. Expelled?
- You're out of here, mister!

01:15.208 --> 01:16.709
Oh, excuse me. That's my cell phone.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.542
-
- Ah.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.375
Oh, it's, it's the wife.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.750
Yes, what is it, Dot?

01:22.375 --> 01:23.834
What?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.041
Oh.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.333
But tonight is the
flamenco dancing finals!

01:28.000 --> 01:28.917
Get-- get, get.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Charlie Brown.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.625
Look, this is our last chance

01:32.709 --> 01:34.667
to, to stick it to the Rosenbaums.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.500
Well, where am I gonna find a babysitter
at the last minute?

01:41.417 --> 01:42.542
<i>Oh...</i>

01:42.625 --> 01:43.625
Oh. Yes, dear.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.417
Yes. All right.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.375
You know,

01:51.417 --> 01:54.333
I might be able to help you out
with your little sitter sitch.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.500
I’m listening. Go on.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.250
I happen to work at
the best child day care in the city.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.333
They're booked solid,
but I could get you in.

02:03.417 --> 02:04.667
But I guess I’m expelled,

02:04.750 --> 02:06.333
so, you know, never mind.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.917
Oh, tell the Rosenbaums
I said mazel tov on their victory.

02:11.583 --> 02:12.834
Wait!

02:14.917 --> 02:16.041
Look, uh...

02:16.792 --> 02:18.959
you get my son Byron
in that day care center

02:19.041 --> 02:19.917
and, uh,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.083
well, we can--

02:21.166 --> 02:22.792
We can forget about you being expelled.

02:23.792 --> 02:24.959
Deal.

02:27.041 --> 02:27.959
Whoa.

02:28.041 --> 02:29.291
Nice moves.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.375
Hey. Do you flamenco?

02:34.750 --> 02:36.083
Before I could walk,

02:36.208 --> 02:38.917
my father taught me
the dance of the fiery legs.

02:39.375 --> 02:40.542
Flame on, brother.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.208

Man, I can't believe how much bigger
they're making the mall.

03:39.041 --> 03:42.000
You know, we really shouldn't be here
without hard hats.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.083
Why?

03:43.166 --> 03:45.208
You see that guy way up there
eating his lunch?

03:45.291 --> 03:47.208
He drops a potato chip from that height,

03:47.291 --> 03:49.166
it'll cut you in half.

03:50.458 --> 03:51.625
Uh-huh.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.792
Scientifically that's not true.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.834
Are you calling my mother a liar?

03:57.917 --> 04:00.834
No, I’m just saying the woman's
extremely loose with her science.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.792
Jerry, this is my dojo.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.667
It's a place of honor,
respect, and integrity.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.917
Come on, Rudy. If we don't do this

04:21.000 --> 04:22.458
I’ll get expelled.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.834
This is not a day care center,

04:24.917 --> 04:25.959
and it never will be!

04:26.041 --> 04:27.834
Dojo Day Care Center.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.291
What a concept.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.083
You're really gonna love it here, Byron.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.000
I am nipping this in the bud right now.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.875
- Rudy, come on.
- Principal Buckett--

04:34.959 --> 04:36.917
Who do I make out the $100 check to?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.291
That would be Rudy Gillespie.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.959
Uh, Milton, Eddie,
take Byron, put him in the ball pit

04:42.041 --> 04:43.333
and give him a graham cracker.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.709
I’m not touching this little snotbag.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.542
That thing is wearing a toilet.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.041
I’ll take him.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.250
- Hey, Baby Byron.
- There you go.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.875
There you go. Later, Byron.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.083
You don't have to worry about a thing,
Principal Buckett.

04:57.166 --> 05:00.000
I’m holding you responsible
for my son, Jerry.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.166
I’ll be back at 7:00,

05:02.291 --> 05:04.959
and my legs will be smoldering.

05:05.041 --> 05:05.875
<i>Olé!</i>

05:07.000 --> 05:09.041
This really stinks, Jerry.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.125
Oh, relax.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.583
It's just a couple of hours
with one little baby.

05:12.667 --> 05:13.583
By the way, I, uh--

05:13.667 --> 05:16.166
I put up a notice on the faculty
bulletin board about this place.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.625
Whoa. Whoa... Oh, my goodness.

05:22.709 --> 05:23.917
Hey. What's going on here?

05:24.041 --> 05:25.750
<i>Whoa, whoa, uh...</i>

05:29.250 --> 05:30.792
I think I just got babied.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

05:33.208 --> 05:35.375
Hey. Hey, hold it. Stop! Stop running!

05:37.250 --> 05:39.250
Stop running!

05:41.125 --> 05:42.875
Hey, that kid's got my trophy again.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.500
<i>Get back here, you!</i>

05:46.291 --> 05:48.000
-
- No.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.166
No!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.291
He snapped my little man's head off.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.792
You better sleep with one eye open
during nap time!

05:59.583 --> 06:00.667
- Rudy.
-

06:02.083 --> 06:03.750
Rudy, where's Milton?

06:03.834 --> 06:05.542
He's changing some baby's diaper.

06:05.625 --> 06:06.500
He is?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.250
Well, what about his fear of germs?

06:25.875 --> 06:27.500
Okay, we should be good now.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.625
That diaper weighed more than he does.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.291
We got an escapee!

06:34.375 --> 06:35.959
Pigtails walking!

06:38.041 --> 06:39.208
Hey.

06:39.291 --> 06:40.500
Back inside.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.458
Come on.

06:42.542 --> 06:43.709
Hey, excuse me?

06:43.792 --> 06:45.333
Can I have my niece back?

06:45.417 --> 06:46.959
Oh. No, I’m sorry.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.250
I thought she was one of ours.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.417
Oh, no, no. I’m taking her over
to the Holiday Suites.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.750
My sister enrolled her
in the Little Miss Seaford Pageant,

06:52.834 --> 06:54.333
then got sick and once again

06:54.417 --> 06:56.291
assumed Old Joanie had no plans.

06:56.792 --> 06:57.875
What were your plans?

06:58.375 --> 06:59.583
Oh, I had no plans.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.291
This is my talent for the pageant.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.291
Oh.

07:07.375 --> 07:08.542
That is great.

07:08.625 --> 07:09.917
Really cute.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.875
She is horrible.

07:12.959 --> 07:13.917
What?

07:14.041 --> 07:15.875
Those pageant kids
have been groomed for years

07:15.959 --> 07:18.625
by mothers who are
lipstick-wearing pit bulls.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.792
Your niece is gonna get eaten alive.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.709
Holy Hanna!

07:22.792 --> 07:23.750
Well-- well, Rudy.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.291
You've had experience taking kids
to competitive tournaments.

07:26.375 --> 07:27.500
You gotta come with me.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.750
I couldn't possibly leave the dojo now.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.333
Oh! Bon-bon in the eye!

07:36.417 --> 07:37.709
Oh.

07:40.291 --> 07:41.333
I’ll drive.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.667
Ohh. Your daughter is so pretty.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.709
Oh, isn't she just?

07:57.792 --> 07:59.375
We call her Sparkle

07:59.458 --> 08:01.375
because that's what she does.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.959
Well, this is my niece.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.083
we call her Gracie Bell
because that's what

08:07.166 --> 08:08.208
she does.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.291
Well.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.875
Don't you have a...

08:12.959 --> 08:14.917
Unique look.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.500
Don't y'all have a wig box?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.458
Oh. I--

08:20.583 --> 08:21.583
I don't know.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.291
Uh, Rudy, do we all have a wig box?

08:25.542 --> 08:27.125
We all don't believe in...

08:28.458 --> 08:30.583
Boxing our wig.

08:30.667 --> 08:31.917
We let our wig roam free.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.834
It's a free-range wig.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.250
There's something I need to say,

08:40.291 --> 08:42.583
and this comes from the heart.

08:42.667 --> 08:46.250
You people are gonna lose,
so you should probably just leave.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.333
What?

08:47.417 --> 08:48.667
Uh...

08:48.750 --> 08:50.542
For your information, miss,

08:50.625 --> 08:53.000
your Sparkle has no chance.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.625
Our Gracie Bell is the essence of class,

08:55.709 --> 08:57.208
beauty, and refinement.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.250
That was my chilI dog barking.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.750
I think we're safe.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.166
Oh!

09:19.250 --> 09:20.583
Did you say we're safe?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.250
Oh, whoa, whoa!

09:26.333 --> 09:27.583
Oh, uh, Jerry,

09:27.667 --> 09:28.875
Where's Baby Byron?

09:30.458 --> 09:31.750
What?

09:31.834 --> 09:32.875
I thought he was with you.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.166
Whoa.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.291
Baby Byron?

09:37.375 --> 09:38.375
Baby Byron?

09:38.458 --> 09:39.792
<i>Baby Byron?</i>
- Baby Byron?

09:39.875 --> 09:41.792
<i>Baby Byron?</i>
- Baby Byron?

09:42.333 --> 09:43.542
Dude, he's not in here!

09:43.583 --> 09:44.750
What?

09:46.166 --> 09:47.875
I’m gonna be expelled.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.667
Oh, forget expelled, I’m going to prison.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.792
Oh, forget prison,
I’m going to summer school!

09:53.875 --> 09:55.750
Do you what they do to guys like me
in summer school?

09:55.834 --> 09:58.208
- Jerry, calm down.
- No, I can't calm down.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.834
I just lost the principal's baby.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.709
Yo. We lost the principal's baby.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.834
Okay, it's not like losing
some English teacher's baby.

10:09.917 --> 10:10.834
This is big time!

10:12.291 --> 10:14.166
<i>Jerry, he's outside, come on!</i>

10:14.250 --> 10:15.250
Uh, Eddie, Milton?

10:15.333 --> 10:16.375
You guys hold down the fort.

10:17.709 --> 10:18.542
What? Dude.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.417
What happened? He was just here.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.375
This kid's like a cheetah in a diaper.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.750
Look, he's gotta be around
here somewhere. Find him!

10:24.834 --> 10:27.208
I’m about to drop some Eddie knowledge
on these fools!

10:27.291 --> 10:29.458
- Ow!
-

10:29.542 --> 10:30.917
This is our house.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.166
No, it's not.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.750
- Yes, it is.
- Wait, who do think you are?

10:33.834 --> 10:34.750
- No, it's not!
- Whoa!

10:34.834 --> 10:35.750
It's our house, buddy.

10:35.834 --> 10:36.792
- Hey!
- No, it's not!

10:36.875 --> 10:38.000
- No, you don't!
- No, it's not!

10:38.083 --> 10:39.000
You heard him--

10:39.083 --> 10:40.458
Ow! This is our house!

10:40.542 --> 10:42.834
- Oh, ow.
- This is our house.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.291
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Aah!</i>

10:45.834 --> 10:46.750
Byron?

10:46.834 --> 10:48.250
Byron, where are you, buddy?

10:48.333 --> 10:49.542
Yo, any luck?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.250
- No.
-

10:52.667 --> 10:55.041
Look-- look, if we can't find this baby,

10:55.125 --> 10:57.291
we'll just have to give Buckett
something that looks like one.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.375
What are you talking about?

10:59.458 --> 11:02.250
I’m talking about slapping a diaper
on a ham and drawing eyeballs on it.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.750
Dude! Dude, there he is!

11:06.917 --> 11:08.667
Hey, Baby Byron.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.125
Who doesn't want to get Jerry expelled?

11:11.208 --> 11:13.291
You don't. No, you don't.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.583
Stay right there.

11:14.709 --> 11:16.166
Who's a good boy?

11:16.250 --> 11:18.250
You're a good boy.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.583
- Hey, no!
- Whoa!

11:19.667 --> 11:21.166
- Stop! Hey!
- Whoa, wait!

11:21.250 --> 11:22.375
You're not a good boy!

11:22.458 --> 11:23.875
You're a very bad boy!

11:23.959 --> 11:25.500
Ah, my baby!

11:25.583 --> 11:26.542
My baby!

11:26.625 --> 11:28.041
Somebody save my baby!

11:52.709 --> 11:54.750
Eyes done.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.208
Now, sit still, darling.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.250
I’m gonna spray on that smile.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.834
This is never gonna work.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.834
I can't believe
you didn't bring any makeup.

12:04.917 --> 12:05.959
Well, don't worry, Rudy.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.417
I got all the beauty supplies we'll need
at the breakfast buffet.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.625
Now put more bacon in her hair.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.208
And we'll use these donuts

12:15.291 --> 12:17.583
to powder her face.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.250
Yeah.

12:19.333 --> 12:20.208
And...

12:20.291 --> 12:22.500
To bring out her lips,

12:22.583 --> 12:25.875
this jelly will do just fine.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.291
What do you think?

12:34.208 --> 12:35.750
Do you think they'll like me?

12:35.834 --> 12:37.542
Oh, of course, they will, honey.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.875
You're smart, and pretty,
and you smell like bacon.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.417
And who doesn't like bacon?

12:44.667 --> 12:47.625
I can't wait to get out there
with my stick and streamer.

12:49.959 --> 12:52.333
Your stick and streamer's
not gonna cut it, donut-face.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.333
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

13:09.208 --> 13:10.834
How the heck did you get up here?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.083
Took the elevator.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.041
Look, you gotta stop fooling around, man.

13:15.166 --> 13:16.917
Buckett will be back for Byron any minute.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Jerry, I’m not fooling around.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.834
- I just climbed all by my--
- Jack!

13:19.917 --> 13:20.959
There he is.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.792
-
- I got this.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.375
Now, you get back here
this instant, young man!

13:32.291 --> 13:33.667
Well, that's all I had.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.542
Here, Baby Byron.

13:38.625 --> 13:39.625
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

13:39.709 --> 13:40.667
No, no!

13:40.750 --> 13:41.875
No!

13:45.792 --> 13:47.000
Let's go.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.125
I made a big mistake
volunteering for this mission.

13:55.792 --> 13:58.208
Seeing a dirty diaper changes a man.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.542
If I don't make it,

14:14.625 --> 14:16.917
give this letter to my girlfriend, Julie.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.083
Don't worry.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.375
The handle's baby-proofed.

14:38.625 --> 14:39.792
Haha!

14:39.875 --> 14:40.917
Dumb babies.

14:52.542 --> 14:53.709
I’m gonna scream.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.208
Aah--

15:01.709 --> 15:03.208
Oh, no!

15:03.291 --> 15:05.208
No, Eddie!

15:05.291 --> 15:06.500
Eddie!

15:06.583 --> 15:07.709
Oh, no!

15:07.792 --> 15:08.875
They got him!

15:09.542 --> 15:10.959
Goodbye, Milton.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.834
Hello, Julie.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.291
Ow, stop.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.000
That's it, babies.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.291
I’ve had enough.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.417
I may go down,

15:28.500 --> 15:29.959
but I’m going down fighting.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.709
Do it again. They like it.

15:43.792 --> 15:44.959
Okay.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.917
- Oops.
- Whoa.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

16:00.083 --> 16:02.375
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

16:06.542 --> 16:07.500
Look what I got for you.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.166
You can wear it during the talent portion.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.750
That's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

16:11.834 --> 16:12.834
Where do you think I got it?

16:12.917 --> 16:14.166
I took it off a little girl's head.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.208
Here, put this on.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.709
Now, remember, when you get out there,

16:18.792 --> 16:20.125
you gotta march like this.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.500
High knees.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.959
Get those high knees up there.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.542
<i>And don't forget to smile.</i>

16:24.625 --> 16:26.000
And-- and big eyes.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.375
Big eyes!

16:27.458 --> 16:28.750
That's the most important thing.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.000
No, no. High knees are important.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.125
High knees.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.375
- High knees.
- Big eyes.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.792
- High knees!
- Big eyes!

16:33.875 --> 16:35.041
- High knees!
- Big eyes!

16:35.125 --> 16:36.709
Big-- Wait, where are you going?

16:36.792 --> 16:38.417
I just want to go home.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.417
Why?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.834
Because you people are acting crazy!

16:44.458 --> 16:45.917
Come on. Let's just go.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.834
Oh, Rudy. What have we done?

16:56.917 --> 16:58.959
<i>Please welcome to the stage,
Gracie Bell.</i>

16:59.041 --> 16:59.917
Gracie?

17:00.917 --> 17:02.333
You take your stick,

17:02.417 --> 17:03.917
and you wave your ribbon.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.083
And you better win because I--

17:07.166 --> 17:08.333
Rudy!

17:08.417 --> 17:09.458
Right.

17:09.542 --> 17:12.417
Sorry, just go out there
and have a great time.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.667
Yeah, get out there
and fly your freak flag, sister!

17:32.542 --> 17:34.542
She really is an awkward little beast.

17:34.625 --> 17:38.458
<i>Yeah,
but she's a happy awkward little beast.</i>

17:41.709 --> 17:42.583
Shall we?

17:42.667 --> 17:43.583
Oh.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.333
Let's.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.500
There he is.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.000
<i>Save him, Jack!</i>

18:18.542 --> 18:19.792
Watch out, he's sliding!

18:24.417 --> 18:26.166
Jerry, I’m losing my grip.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.542
- Ah.
-

18:27.625 --> 18:29.250
Come on.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.333
Nice save, Jerry.

18:40.417 --> 18:41.709
I’m never having kids.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.583
Look! Here comes Principal Buckett.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.375
I’ll lower you down, hang on.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.834
-
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.083
Oh, Jerry.

19:14.166 --> 19:15.041
There you are.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.625
Oh, you should have seen me.
I was like a human firecracker.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.667
What are you, what are you two
doing outside?

19:20.750 --> 19:21.917
Uh...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.208
We just-- we just wanted to grab
some fresh air.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.417
Oh. Say, he wasn't, uh--

19:26.500 --> 19:28.542
He wasn't climbing up
on any of this stuff, was he?

19:29.917 --> 19:31.959
No. Why?

19:32.041 --> 19:33.375
Oh, because, uh,

19:33.458 --> 19:35.959
he's absolutely terrified of heights.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.834
Sure, okay.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.250
Okay.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.875
Thanks for everything you did.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.166
I’ll see you at school on Monday.

19:52.667 --> 19:53.917
That was fun.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.667
Can we come back tomorrow, Mommy?

19:55.750 --> 19:57.250
No!

19:58.250 --> 20:00.875
Dojo Day Care is officially closed.

20:05.083 --> 20:05.917
Well...

20:06.000 --> 20:07.583
That's it. We're done.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.041
All the kids have been picked up.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.375
Not quite.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.792
There's still one kid left.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.959
Little Matty Edsall.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.375
- Matty?
- Matty?

20:17.458 --> 20:18.583
Where is she?

20:18.667 --> 20:20.375
Matty?

20:20.458 --> 20:21.542
- Come on, Matty.
- Matty?

20:21.625 --> 20:23.125
Oh. There she is.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.417
She's outside in the courtyard.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.125
Milton, Eddie?

20:29.250 --> 20:30.458
This one's yours.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.166
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:37.875 --> 20:39.875
Our handprints are gonna be here forever.

20:39.959 --> 20:42.250
An immortal testament
to our enduring friendship.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.250
Rudy, it's been 10 minutes. Is it set?

20:45.333 --> 20:46.500
Has it been that long?

20:46.583 --> 20:47.500
We're good.

20:50.834 --> 20:51.667
What?

20:51.750 --> 20:52.709
Rudy, we're stuck.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.250
All right, nobody panic.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.709
I’m sure this has happened before.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.542
Worst. Babysitters.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.625
Ever.
