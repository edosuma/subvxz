01:42.935 --> 01:45.605
It's a tragedy what's been happening
to the university.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.566
- Robberies, vandalism.
- Where will it end?

01:50.610 --> 01:52.570
Dr. Long! Dr. Long,

01:52.653 --> 01:54.947
<i>I'm</i> Summer Gleeson with <i>Gotham Insider.</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:57.742
Can I ask you a few questions
about the recent robberies?

01:57.825 --> 01:59.076
All right, but I'm in a hurry.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.037
Dr. Long, do you have any idea

02:01.120 --> 02:03.748
why someone would want to
destroy the university?

02:04.248 --> 02:05.916
No, but one more disaster

02:06.000 --> 02:08.753
and students will be afraid
to set foot on this campus.

02:11.672 --> 02:13.049
Hello, Summer.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.384
Bruce! What a pleasant surprise.

02:25.519 --> 02:28.022
Dr. Long, have you met Bruce Wayne?

02:29.815 --> 02:32.318
Your father and I
attended university together.

02:32.401 --> 02:35.655
- He had big plans for you.
- Well, I guess he'd be pleased.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.074
Wayne Industries
is more prosperous than ever.

02:38.157 --> 02:40.326
Pleased? When your father was alive,

02:40.409 --> 02:43.079
Wayne was a name
that commanded great respect.

02:43.162 --> 02:48.292
Now, all Wayne stands for
is a self-centered, jet-setting playboy.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.671
It's lucky your father didn't live to
see what you've done to his good name.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.714
He'd have died of shame.

02:54.256 --> 02:57.426
Wait, Dr. Long,
I haven't finished the interview.

02:57.635 --> 03:01.681
He's probably just venting his anger
over what's happening to the university.

04:04.034 --> 04:05.828
Hold it right there!

04:08.664 --> 04:10.166
Hey, what are you...

04:11.542 --> 04:13.210
Stop! What the...

04:13.419 --> 04:15.129
No! No, spiders!

04:15.713 --> 04:18.674
Get them off of me! No! No!

04:22.303 --> 04:24.346
What did you do to him, boss?

04:24.430 --> 04:27.725
I merely helped him visualize
his innermost terror,

04:27.933 --> 04:30.561
which is obviously arachnophobia.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.731
- A-whack-a-what?
- Arachnophobia.

04:34.064 --> 04:36.776
Fear of spiders, you dimwitted dropout!

04:37.276 --> 04:38.903
Now, to the vault.

04:47.578 --> 04:51.332
- Nigel, you'll stand guard here.
- I'm ready for anything.

05:00.424 --> 05:02.259
Come to Papa.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.887
Take what you can, then burn the rest.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.347
Burn it, boss?

05:06.430 --> 05:09.058
This isn't about money,
it's about revenge.

05:22.238 --> 05:26.116
Help, boss! It's the Batman.
He's got me...

05:26.617 --> 05:29.036
Climb up there and wait for my signal.

05:29.119 --> 05:30.538
Sure thing, boss.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.512
Welcome, Batman.

05:49.431 --> 05:50.891
Oh, a gas mask.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.436
Perhaps you are as resourceful
as they say.

05:54.937 --> 05:55.980
Who are you?

05:56.397 --> 05:58.274
I am fear incarnate.

05:59.149 --> 06:03.362
I am the terror of Gotham.
I am the Scarecrow.

06:04.446 --> 06:06.740
Give it up. There's no way out.

06:07.157 --> 06:08.909
Except through you.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.851
Fight all you want, Batman,

06:34.310 --> 06:36.687
but you must succumb to the fear.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.693
What hidden terror
keeps the Batman awake at night?

06:44.695 --> 06:47.364
Come on, you cretins. My work is done.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.888
<i>Bruce.</i>

07:11.931 --> 07:13.057
What?

07:13.849 --> 07:15.100
Can't be.

07:16.518 --> 07:17.770
<i>Bruce...</i>

07:18.228 --> 07:20.272
<i>Bruce, you have failed me.</i>

07:20.981 --> 07:22.191
Father?

07:23.442 --> 07:25.945
<i>You have disgraced the family name.</i>

07:51.428 --> 07:52.596
Wait.

08:01.855 --> 08:03.732
Batman, what happened?

08:05.275 --> 08:06.610
Scarecrow.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.238
Scarecrow? What do you mean?

08:09.405 --> 08:12.116
He's right.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.618
It was some guy
dressed like a scarecrow.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.913
He tried to torch the bank,
but Batman stopped him.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.125
All right, then.
Where is this scarecrow?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.918
Well, he got away.

08:23.585 --> 08:27.381
You mean the Commissioner's pet bat here
let him get away?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.259
What do you got there, vigilante?

08:30.467 --> 08:32.136
Looks like police evidence.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.722
Give it up. Now!

08:36.849 --> 08:39.309
Ooh, looks like I'm going to have to
take it from you.

08:40.060 --> 08:43.063
Bullock, what the blazes
is going on here?

08:43.147 --> 08:46.108
"Blaze" is right, Commissioner.
It's attempted arson.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.485
Zorro here is withholding evid...

08:49.403 --> 08:50.779
Where the...

08:50.863 --> 08:52.531
You were saying?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.742
Ah, never mind.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.797
<i>Tonight's arson attempt by someone</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:10.716
<i>calling himself the "Scarecrow"</i>

09:10.799 --> 09:12.301
<i>was thwarted by Batman.</i>

09:12.384 --> 09:15.304
It seems
I have underestimated the Batman.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.765
But at least the university is finished.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.975
Gee, boss,
I never liked school.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.062
But how come you hate
the university so much?

09:23.145 --> 09:25.147
They tried to destroy me.

09:25.522 --> 09:28.275
You mean they kicked you out
'cause you weren't smart enough?

09:28.358 --> 09:30.402
- No, you simpleton.
- Ow!

09:31.278 --> 09:32.613
I taught there.

09:32.696 --> 09:36.283
I was a professor of psychology,
specializing in phobias.

09:36.366 --> 09:39.119
Inducing terror has always intrigued me.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.915
<i>Even as a boy,
I loved to frighten things.</i>

09:42.998 --> 09:45.334
<i>People, animals, it was all the same.</i>

09:45.417 --> 09:48.420
<i>I became obsessed
with fear's crippling power.</i>

09:49.797 --> 09:52.716
<i>Later, when I became
their leading professor</i>

09:52.800 --> 09:55.052
<i>of subliminal psychology
at the university,</i>

09:55.135 --> 10:00.224
<i>I began performing experiments
on fear and its subsequent effects.</i>

10:00.307 --> 10:02.643
<i>Dr. Long thought I went too far.</i>

10:03.143 --> 10:05.062
<i>He called me a lunatic.</i>

10:06.021 --> 10:10.067
So now, they will learn
the true nature of horror.

10:10.317 --> 10:12.319
Wow. He's a real professor.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.583
<i>You'll feel like a million dollars.</i>

10:36.176 --> 10:38.554
<i>Exhibit A, scarecrow mask.</i>

10:38.887 --> 10:40.430
<i>Will analyze and cross-reference.</i>

10:50.232 --> 10:52.151
<i>You've failed me, son.</i>

10:54.570 --> 10:58.240
<i>This is Summer Gleeson, back live
at the Gotham State University.</i>

10:58.323 --> 11:00.659
<i>The campus bank
was the target of a robbery</i>

11:00.742 --> 11:04.246
<i>and a malicious arson attempt
by the so-called Scarecrow.</i>

11:04.329 --> 11:06.790
<i>Though the Batman did thwart the arson,</i>

11:06.874 --> 11:09.084
<i>he failed to catch the perpetrators.</i>

11:09.168 --> 11:11.336
<i>Failed to catch the perpetrators.</i>

11:11.420 --> 11:13.922
<i>Failed. Failed. Failed.</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:17.801
- Imagine that, sir.
- Huh? What?

11:17.885 --> 11:20.762
Someone dressed up
in a frightening costume,

11:20.846 --> 11:22.681
running around scaring people.

11:22.764 --> 11:24.683
What will they think of next?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.768
The question is,

11:27.102 --> 11:30.731
why would Scarecrow
want to destroy the university?

11:31.064 --> 11:33.192
Perhaps he flunked Phys. Ed.

11:35.235 --> 11:36.612
Are you all right, sir?

11:36.695 --> 11:40.490
The Scarecrow drugged me
with some kind of fear toxin.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.868
I never know when it's going to hit me.

11:43.452 --> 11:47.372
I'm having horrible visions
of my father.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.170
He says I'm shaming the family name.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.964
That's rubbish.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.217
I know your father
would be proud of you,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.720
because I'm so proud of you.

12:01.803 --> 12:04.932
Come on, it's time for chicken soup
and a good night's sleep.

12:06.391 --> 12:08.060
- Alfred.
- Yes, sir?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.645
Thanks.

12:33.585 --> 12:35.212
Hey, what's that?

12:36.546 --> 12:38.257
We're being gassed!

12:50.394 --> 12:52.437
- They've got guns!
- Guns?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.024
Thank you, Dr. Long.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.526
I'll take that.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.862
- Over my dead body.
- If you insist.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.739
Oh!

13:02.823 --> 13:04.366
What's happening?

13:08.245 --> 13:09.371
Help!

13:12.332 --> 13:15.294
Bring him. His torture has just begun.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.927
No! Get them off my back!

13:30.267 --> 13:33.145
Batman, I am surprised.

13:33.437 --> 13:37.357
I thought you'd be home enjoying
my time-released fear toxin.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.611
Welcome to
everyone's worst fear.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.322
Isn't it invigorating?

13:43.405 --> 13:45.032
It's a giant bat!

13:50.203 --> 13:51.496
Get him!

13:55.500 --> 13:58.462
Marvelous. Simply marvelous.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.390
My revenge is complete.

14:51.848 --> 14:57.145
The university is in the grip of fear,
and Batman has been annihilated.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.397
Huh?

14:58.605 --> 15:02.109
Annihilated. Destroyed. Dead.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.443
Then who's that?

15:05.278 --> 15:08.448
I don't believe it.
Anthony, take care of him.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.866
Who, me?

15:09.950 --> 15:12.452
- Er... But, boss...
- Do it!

15:21.962 --> 15:23.380
End of the line.

15:32.639 --> 15:33.932
Look out!

15:49.531 --> 15:52.492
- Do something.
- Me? You're the genius.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.202
Oh, no! Look!

16:08.925 --> 16:10.427
Help!

16:26.526 --> 16:28.361
What are we going to do, Professor?

16:28.445 --> 16:31.323
I believe we can leave it
to my fear toxin.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.078
<i>Bruce.</i>

16:41.208 --> 16:43.084
No, not now.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.670
<i>You are a disgrace.</i>

16:46.087 --> 16:48.381
No! No!

16:48.548 --> 16:52.260
You are not my father.
I am not a disgrace.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.679
I am vengeance.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.598
I am the night.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.768
I am Batman!

17:30.757 --> 17:32.008
Stop him!

17:33.677 --> 17:34.886
Gotcha!

17:53.238 --> 17:55.407
No. No more prison walls.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.077
They're closing in on me. No!

18:07.836 --> 18:09.754
It's over, Scarecrow.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.382
Only for you and the doctor, Batman.

18:34.237 --> 18:37.073
- What's going on?
- Just hold on.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.283
But how?

19:09.773 --> 19:13.610
<i>Exhibit A, scarecrow mask.
Analysis complete.</i>

19:14.110 --> 19:17.739
<i>Substance is manufactured
by five corporations in Gotham City.</i>

19:18.198 --> 19:20.909
<i>Axis Engineering, Bio Laboratories,</i>

19:20.992 --> 19:24.829
<i>Crane Chemicals,
Macurity Manufacturing, Star Labs.</i>

19:24.913 --> 19:27.582
Computer, cross-reference
former employees

19:27.666 --> 19:30.627
of Gotham State University
with the chemical labs.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.045
<i>Searching.</i>

19:32.128 --> 19:34.673
<i>Found. One Jonathan Crane.</i>

19:35.131 --> 19:37.550
<i>Owner, operator of Crane Chemicals.</i>

19:37.634 --> 19:39.052
Background on Crane.

19:39.135 --> 19:41.596
<i>Searching.
Former professor of psychology.</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:44.766
<i>Specialty, fear and phobias.</i>

19:44.849 --> 19:46.017
Bingo.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.280
It's not fair.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.324
Revenge was within my grasp.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.909
I was so close.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.955
Hmm?

20:14.629 --> 20:15.839
What's going on?

20:18.758 --> 20:20.176
Who's there?

20:29.269 --> 20:30.895
No. Please.

20:45.660 --> 20:48.204
No, stop. Leave me alone.

20:49.038 --> 20:50.874
What's the matter, Scarecrow?

20:50.957 --> 20:53.251
Can't handle your own medicine?

20:54.919 --> 20:55.920
Batman.

20:56.004 --> 21:00.133
No. Stay away. Stay away, please.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.514
Stay away.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.102
Oh, yes.

21:12.687 --> 21:16.024
Look at the facts, Commissioner.
Batman's withholding evidence.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.318
Even helped the Scarecrow guy escape.

21:18.401 --> 21:21.279
I'd bet my badge
he and Scarecrow are in cahoots.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.947
Your badge, eh?

21:24.991 --> 21:26.201
Huh?

21:26.785 --> 21:29.120
Now, about that badge...

22:20.672 --> 22:21.673
English - SDH
