A boy was arrested today

33:46.980 --> 33:49.271
in what appears to be a crime
exposed by a video

33:49.354 --> 33:51.021

Gardner High student

33:51.104 --> 33:52.980
in a vulnerable state
of intoxication.

33:53.062 --> 33:55.604
The minor in question
was charged with video--

GREGG: (OVER PHONE)
I don't know how they got it,

33:57.479 --> 33:59.688
but they'll keep everyone
anonymous.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.312
Is he there right now?

34:01.396 --> 34:02.438
GREGG:
No.

34:02.521 --> 34:03.688
Where-- Where is he?

34:03.771 --> 34:05.229
GREGG:
He's with his family.

34:05.312 --> 34:07.021
With a charge like
video voyeurism,

34:07.104 --> 34:08.730
-we can't really keep him--
-MICKEY: Video voyeurism?

34:08.813 --> 34:10.730
What does-- You're not
charging him with assault?

34:10.813 --> 34:12.354
GREGG:
We're still investigating.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.771
We can request an order
of protection, though.

34:14.855 --> 34:16.563
-Keep them separated at school.
-Wait, wait, wait.

34:16.646 --> 34:18.062
What--
He's still at school?

34:18.146 --> 34:19.271
-GREGG: Yes.
-Why is-- Why--

34:19.354 --> 34:21.146
Why is he the only one charged?

34:21.229 --> 34:22.688
GREGG: He's the only one
who's admitted to us

34:22.771 --> 34:25.813
that he took any, um,
graphic photos of her.

Well, no. Just the things
you told us he'd said.

It's a start. I'm sure this
will stir up some more stories,
