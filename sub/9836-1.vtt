WEBVTT

00:51.702 --> 00:53.294
Shh! Shh!

00:59.443 --> 01:04.403
The story you are about to see
has been told before. A lot.

01:04.482 --> 01:08.680
And now we are going to tell it again.
But different.

01:08.719 --> 01:12.849
It's about two star-crossed lovers
kept apart by a big feud.

01:12.923 --> 01:16.757
No one knows how this feud started,
but it's all quite entertaining.

01:18.262 --> 01:22.961
Unfortunately, before we begin,
there is a rather long, boring prologue,

01:23.000 --> 01:24.763
which I will read to you now.

01:27.138 --> 01:30.733
"Two households, both alike in dignity,"

01:30.808 --> 01:32.571
In fair Verona...

01:34.145 --> 01:36.045
Where we lay our scene,

01:36.080 --> 01:38.776
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

01:38.849 --> 01:42.580
Where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.583
"From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes..."

02:08.045 --> 02:11.674
Ah, Miss Montague,
out you come to ruin my day.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.674
My, that's a hideous cardigan,
Mr. Capulet. It suits you.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.084
Wizened old hag.

02:17.121 --> 02:19.419
You crumbly old codger.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.971
Oh, great.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.119
No, this way!

02:55.159 --> 02:56.387
Whoa!

03:02.566 --> 03:04.500
I got one! I got one!

03:08.505 --> 03:09.938
I got one! I got one!

03:12.610 --> 03:14.544
Winston! Throw us the ball!

03:16.180 --> 03:17.408
Huh?

03:18.849 --> 03:20.111
Huh?

03:30.394 --> 03:31.793
Tybalt!

03:36.066 --> 03:39.035
Oh, those Blues are at it again.

03:43.107 --> 03:45.667
Top of the morning,
Lord Redbrick!

03:45.743 --> 03:46.971
Lady Bluebury.

03:47.011 --> 03:51.243
Your tulips are looking a little limp
this year, aren't they?

03:51.315 --> 03:54.148
Oh! I don't like
what you're incinerating.

03:54.184 --> 03:57.585
The proper word is "insinuating."

03:57.655 --> 03:59.179
Illiterate.

03:59.223 --> 04:02.556
I am not illiterate!
My parents were married!

04:12.102 --> 04:15.503
Benny! Come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.234
Yeah.

04:17.308 --> 04:19.003
Shroom, all clear?

04:21.478 --> 04:23.708
Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

04:23.781 --> 04:26.011
- Gnomeo! It's your mum!
- Huh? Oh, no!

04:26.050 --> 04:28.143
Just get this out into the alley!
I'll catch up with you.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.584
- OK, OK.
- Gnomeo...

04:29.653 --> 04:35.614
Mum! Have you ever seen our beautiful,
beautiful garden from this angle?

04:35.826 --> 04:39.694
Oh, yes. Especially the wisteria.

04:40.197 --> 04:44.065
That tree was your father's
pride and joy.

04:44.134 --> 04:46.602
May he rest in pieces.

04:46.670 --> 04:50.401
Oh, how you remind me of him.

04:50.474 --> 04:52.237
Oh. Which is why I wanted to say...

04:52.276 --> 04:54.369
- I know. I know. My chores.
- Gnomeo...

04:54.411 --> 04:57.073
Edging, trimming, planting, pruning.
Consider it all done.

04:57.147 --> 04:59.240
- I wanted to say...
- Done, done. It's done like I did it.

04:59.283 --> 05:00.978
- Gnomeo!
- Done.

05:01.051 --> 05:05.579
All I wanted to say was "good luck."

05:06.890 --> 05:08.255
Thanks, Mum.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.990
Go out there and show them we Blues

05:12.062 --> 05:14.895
are better than any Red!

05:14.932 --> 05:17.093
Red. I hate the word.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.232
Wow!

05:23.273 --> 05:25.537
A Cupid's Arrow orchid!

05:26.744 --> 05:28.234
Oh! Juliet!

05:28.278 --> 05:29.939
Huh? Oh! Whoa!

05:31.415 --> 05:32.677
Oh.

05:36.987 --> 05:39.581
Hiya, Dad!
You won't believe what I found!

05:39.623 --> 05:40.988
Do you want to get smashed?

05:41.058 --> 05:44.960
Aflower that will put that Blue garden
to shame, just across the alley.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.828
This feud business
is none of your concern.

05:47.898 --> 05:50.230
And as leader of this garden,
it's up to me to...

05:50.267 --> 05:53.031
Uh, I am a Red, after all.

05:53.103 --> 05:57.267
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was. Bless her to bits.

05:57.307 --> 05:59.537
Now, back where you belong.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.340
I can't just stay tucked away
on this pedestal all my life.

06:02.413 --> 06:05.905
Don't you see?
When will you realize you're delicate?

06:05.949 --> 06:08.782
I'm not delicate!

06:08.819 --> 06:11.447
She's definitely not delicate.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.256
Stubborn girl.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.617
Right.

06:19.129 --> 06:23.190
Delicate? Hmm!
I'll show him who's delicate.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.862
Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

06:27.938 --> 06:31.169
Tybalt, go!
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

06:31.241 --> 06:33.971
Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

06:34.011 --> 06:37.037
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

06:37.114 --> 06:38.604
Gnomeo!

06:38.649 --> 06:42.813
OK, boys, y'all know the rules,
and I don't need to repeat them.

06:42.853 --> 06:46.311
But I'm gonna, because I wanna.
And here they are:

06:46.356 --> 06:49.655
No biting, no scratching,
no kicking, no burping,

06:49.693 --> 06:51.752
no slurping, no cussing, no squalling,

06:51.829 --> 06:54.730
no rassling, no heeing, no hawing,

06:54.798 --> 06:58.529
and more than anything, no cheating!

06:58.602 --> 07:01.036
No cheating? Hey, that's not fair!

07:01.071 --> 07:05.030
- Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!
- On your marks! Get set!

07:05.075 --> 07:07.543
- Sucker!
- Go, go, go!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.592
Huh?

07:51.321 --> 07:52.686
Aah!

07:53.423 --> 07:54.890
Whoa!

08:05.736 --> 08:08.170
No!

08:08.238 --> 08:10.968
Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

08:11.041 --> 08:13.271
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

08:40.270 --> 08:43.933
You're the greatest, boss.
The greatest by far.

08:43.974 --> 08:46.442
The greatest! The greatest by far!

08:46.476 --> 08:51.004
Oh! Please, please, my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.

08:51.081 --> 08:53.606
A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are!

08:53.650 --> 08:55.982
A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are!

08:57.154 --> 08:59.554
Well, Benny, I didn't think
it was possible,

08:59.590 --> 09:02.616
but your mouth is getting
even bigger than your hat!

09:04.861 --> 09:06.829
Tybalt! You just crossed the line!

09:06.863 --> 09:08.888
Yeah! The finish line!

09:10.634 --> 09:14.365
Adios, loser!

09:14.438 --> 09:17.669
Hey! Come on out and fight
like a gnome!

09:18.542 --> 09:21.807
- Flower boy won't come out!
- What's he gonna do?

09:21.845 --> 09:24.837
- You better do something!
- He can't get away with that!

09:24.881 --> 09:28.476
Show him! Show him! Come on!

09:30.087 --> 09:33.113
Well, if he won't come out,
I guess we'll just have to go in.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.058
The Red garden?
No one's ever been in there!

09:37.127 --> 09:39.493
Then I'd say
it's about time someone did.

09:40.130 --> 09:43.395
And payback is going to be fun.

10:00.450 --> 10:04.216
Shroom, let's go kick some grass.

10:07.024 --> 10:10.221
This mission into Red garden territory

10:10.360 --> 10:13.591
is going to require maximum stealth.

10:13.664 --> 10:16.258
Well, you won't get much
stealthier than this.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.962
Hello!

10:36.053 --> 10:37.953
I got one.

10:39.423 --> 10:41.050
I got one.

10:44.761 --> 10:46.456
Swim away. Be free.

10:46.530 --> 10:47.895
Oh! Thank you.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.270
I got one.

11:17.561 --> 11:20.962
All this for some daffy flower.

11:20.997 --> 11:24.763
Yes. It's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.

11:24.801 --> 11:26.826
And I'm gonna need you to cover,
Nanette.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.701
If my dad asks, just tell him
I'm washing my hair.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.297
"I'm washing my hair."

11:31.341 --> 11:33.832
I don't have hair!
He'll know it's a lie!

11:33.910 --> 11:37.710
- No, my hair!
- Got it! I'm washing your hair!

11:37.781 --> 11:40.579
OK, OK, whatever you say. I'll be quick.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.614
Out! Out!

11:47.657 --> 11:49.284
Damn, Spot!
Over here, boy!

11:50.560 --> 11:52.118
Wow! That was quick!

11:52.162 --> 11:55.654
I'm too easy to see.
I'm gonna need some kind of disguise.

11:55.699 --> 11:59.100
Ooh! A new outfit! I'm on it.

12:04.107 --> 12:06.667
Here. That is cute.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.175
Give us a turn.

12:09.146 --> 12:13.742
Nice junk in the trunk.
Now, go get your flower.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.344
Uh... Maybe a tad less fluorescent pink?

12:17.387 --> 12:18.877
How much less?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.081
Try black.

12:25.362 --> 12:28.160
Huh?

12:33.670 --> 12:38.004
Trust me. Nobody is going
to pay you any attention in that.

12:38.041 --> 12:39.406
Then it's perfect.

12:45.549 --> 12:46.675
Ooh!

12:52.022 --> 12:53.250
I'm going in.

13:02.999 --> 13:06.025
Take care! I'll tell your dad
you're doing your hair!

13:08.672 --> 13:12.039
Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a movie.

13:12.075 --> 13:16.569
It's one word,
and it starts with, um, "Spider."

13:16.646 --> 13:18.079
Is it <i>Spider-Man?</i>

13:18.114 --> 13:20.048
Oh, you're good. OK.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.926
This is great! I love going commando!

13:41.004 --> 13:43.768
Shh! Now, just keep quiet.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.487
Shh!

14:12.836 --> 14:17.933
OK, I have another one. Two words.
The first word is "Spider-Man."

14:17.974 --> 14:19.441
<i>Spider-Man 2?</i>

14:19.476 --> 14:21.808
OK, who's cheating?

14:31.187 --> 14:34.281
Benny, give me the paint. Benny?

14:34.324 --> 14:36.656
No.

14:44.434 --> 14:45.958
- Benny! Benny!
- Oh!

14:56.146 --> 14:58.046
- Huh?
- Huh?

14:59.549 --> 15:01.141
- Tybalt!
- Get them, you idiots!

15:01.184 --> 15:02.651
Come on, let's go!

15:02.686 --> 15:04.051
Run for it! Now!

15:10.493 --> 15:12.984
- Where did he go?!
- He's in the begonias!

15:13.029 --> 15:16.726
- Well, do I look like a begonia?
- No, more like a pansy.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.994
Find him!

15:18.034 --> 15:20.468
- Not here.
- Not here either.

15:22.872 --> 15:25.204
Nothing but daisies here.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.507
Come on!

15:34.150 --> 15:35.708
Hold on.

15:35.785 --> 15:37.514
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

15:37.554 --> 15:41.888
- Hey, Benny. See you on the other side!
- Gnomeo! No!

15:50.934 --> 15:52.196
Huh?

16:08.685 --> 16:10.312
Hmm?

16:10.920 --> 16:12.080
Huh?

16:19.529 --> 16:22.327
I wish I could stay, but gotta fly.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.141
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

16:42.419 --> 16:43.784
Huh.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.366
# <i>Feet are feelin' light</i>

17:09.612 --> 17:12.274
# <i>Head on out to see the sights</i>

17:15.552 --> 17:20.717
# <i>Ain't life a many splendored thing?</i>

17:24.094 --> 17:29.122
<i>Ducking up and down</i>
<i>All these crazy sights and sounds</i>

17:29.165 --> 17:33.829
# <i>Bounce around</i>
<i>like puppets on a string</i>

17:35.438 --> 17:41.343
# <i>Never gonna find</i>
<i>Anything to change my mind</i>

17:41.377 --> 17:45.074
# <i>Famous last lines of a fool</i>

17:47.584 --> 17:52.214
# <i>Just when you think</i>
<i>You're a chain with just one link</i>

17:52.288 --> 17:57.157
# <i>Something comes</i>
<i>to tip you off of your stool</i>

17:57.694 --> 18:00.891
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

18:00.964 --> 18:03.956
# <i>My, my, my, what have we here?</i>

18:04.934 --> 18:07.835
# <i>What a surprise</i>
<i>What a surprise</i>

18:07.871 --> 18:10.840
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

18:10.874 --> 18:14.002
# <i>I'm not alone</i>
<i>It's good to know</i>

18:14.043 --> 18:18.844
# <i>Someone's out there to say hello</i>

18:18.882 --> 18:22.045
# <i>Hello</i>

18:22.085 --> 18:23.712
Um...

18:23.753 --> 18:26.017
You're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.

18:26.055 --> 18:29.252
It's just I...
Well, I thought no one lived here.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.658
They... don't. I mean, I don't.
This isn't my garden.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.858
Oh, well, that's good because
I just came to get that orchid.

18:35.899 --> 18:38.732
- Oh. This?
- Yes.

18:39.903 --> 18:42.463
I don't know, I think I'm going
to have to keep ahold of this one.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.407
What? But I saw it first,
so why don't you just hand it over.

18:46.442 --> 18:49.900
Well, I grabbed it first.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

18:49.979 --> 18:52.379
But if you want it, come and get it.

18:52.415 --> 18:54.747
All right. Thanks.

18:54.784 --> 18:56.684
Nice greenhouse, eh?

18:56.719 --> 18:59.517
- Oh, yeah, you should see it from here.
- And miss this view?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.385
- Who's your gnomey?
- "Who's your gnomey?"

19:07.430 --> 19:08.920
Whoa!

19:09.933 --> 19:12.367
Who's your gnomey now?

19:14.604 --> 19:16.731
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

19:16.806 --> 19:20.173
- Hey!
- # <i>My, my, my, what have we here?</i>

19:20.243 --> 19:21.574
Whoa!

19:21.611 --> 19:24.705
# <i>What a surprise</i>
<i>What a surprise</i>

19:24.747 --> 19:27.511
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

19:27.584 --> 19:30.712
# <i>I'm not alone</i>
<i>It's good to know</i>

19:30.753 --> 19:36.055
- # <i>Someone's out there to say hello</i>
- # <i>Hello</i>

19:36.092 --> 19:38.993
- # <i>Hello</i>
- # <i>Hello</i>

19:39.062 --> 19:41.530
# <i>Hello</i>

19:41.598 --> 19:43.862
# <i>Hello</i>

19:45.034 --> 19:47.127
# <i>Hello, hello</i>

19:47.170 --> 19:49.866
# <i>Hello</i>

19:49.939 --> 19:53.636
# <i>Hello, hello</i> #.

20:10.326 --> 20:13.318
Oh, no. He's a Blue. Not a Blue.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.874
Juliet. You're not allowed
off your pedestal.

20:34.951 --> 20:36.919
What are you doing
out in the alley?

20:36.986 --> 20:40.683
I'm, um... Well, I could ask you
the same question, Tybalt.

20:40.757 --> 20:44.318
We're looking for a blue gnome.
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.023
- Got a scratch, right here.
- And his name's Gnomeo.

20:48.097 --> 20:50.190
You haven't seen him, have you?

20:50.233 --> 20:52.030
Uh... Ooh. Um...

20:53.569 --> 20:55.196
Uh... He sounds awful.

20:55.238 --> 20:58.867
No, I... I, um, certainly haven't seen
him. I haven't seen him at all.

20:58.908 --> 21:02.344
Well, lucky you.
Come on. Let's get inside.

21:08.151 --> 21:10.346
Juliet.

21:21.898 --> 21:23.365
A Red.

21:24.734 --> 21:27.862
Why, of all things,
did she have to be a Red?

21:32.942 --> 21:37.174
So, where is the oh-so-important,
life-changing orchid?

21:37.213 --> 21:40.842
Um... Um...

21:40.883 --> 21:42.874
What... What orchid?

21:50.827 --> 21:52.294
What?

21:52.362 --> 21:53.989
Hmm?

21:55.264 --> 21:58.631
Shut up! You met a boy!

21:58.701 --> 22:02.762
What? No. Well, maybe, sort of. Um...

22:02.839 --> 22:05.672
Yes. Yes, I did.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.075
I need details! And go slowly!

22:09.112 --> 22:11.137
- Is he totally gorgeous?
- Totally.

22:11.214 --> 22:13.409
Does he have a nice rotund belly?

22:13.449 --> 22:14.916
Well, let's call it sturdy.

22:14.951 --> 22:16.748
And his, uh...

22:17.553 --> 22:19.453
His hat is, um...

22:19.522 --> 22:21.615
- Big and pointy?
- And...

22:21.657 --> 22:23.955
You know,
I suppose in a certain light,

22:23.993 --> 22:27.759
you might say it looks sort of... blue.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.466
Blue.

22:34.303 --> 22:37.295
Ah! This is one of your little jokes!

22:39.742 --> 22:41.767
No, I don't get it.

22:41.811 --> 22:44.143
Oh! Flipping, flaming Nora!

22:44.213 --> 22:46.340
She's smooching the face off a Blue!

22:46.416 --> 22:48.350
Shh! Please shush, Nanette. Just zip it.

22:48.418 --> 22:50.181
Zip.

22:52.989 --> 22:55.719
Oh! Juliet! This is fantastic!

22:55.792 --> 22:58.386
- Is it?
- It's doomed.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.055
- What?
- A Red and a Blue.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.394
It just can't be.

23:03.466 --> 23:07.960
So it's a doomed love,
and that's the best kind.

23:08.004 --> 23:09.733
You'll never see him again.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.535
And then one day when you die,
you'll be all...

23:11.607 --> 23:16.943
"Oh, my true love. I only saw him once."

23:25.054 --> 23:26.817
I'll only see... What do you mean...

23:26.856 --> 23:30.314
What are you chatting about "once,"
I'll only see him once?

23:30.359 --> 23:33.157
How romantically tragic.

23:34.964 --> 23:37.660
Your love is doomed. Your love is dead.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.191
Your love is doomed. Your love is dead.

23:40.269 --> 23:41.566
It's doomed. Dead.

23:41.637 --> 23:45.300
- I'll only see him once?
- Doomed!

23:55.751 --> 23:58.311
I've never seen
Lord Redbrick so riled up.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.721
We have to find Gnomeo. Let's split up.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.125
I wish I could quit you.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.527
Hmm!

24:08.564 --> 24:10.464
Oh, well, let's go fishing.

24:15.505 --> 24:17.905
All right, boy.

24:22.311 --> 24:23.676
Go find Gnomeo.

24:29.385 --> 24:35.415
Doomed. Dead.
Doomed. Dead. Doomed. Dead.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.491
O Gnomeo, Gnomeo,

24:46.569 --> 24:50.505
are we really doomed, Gnomeo,
to never see each other again?

24:50.573 --> 24:52.700
Why must you wear a blue hat?

24:52.742 --> 24:57.372
Why couldn't it be red like my father,
or... or green like a leprechaun?

24:57.413 --> 25:02.783
Or purple like, um... like, uh...
like some weird guy?

25:02.818 --> 25:05.446
I mean, what's in a gnome? Because
you're blue, my father sees red,

25:05.488 --> 25:07.956
and because I'm red, I'm feeling blue.

25:08.024 --> 25:11.255
Oh. At any rate, that shouldn't be
the thing to keep us apart, should it?

25:11.294 --> 25:14.593
No! No, it shouldn't!
I couldn't have said it better myself!

25:14.630 --> 25:18.396
Oh, my giddy aunt. Did you just hear
all of that? What are you doing here?

25:18.434 --> 25:22.268
I don't know. Um... I came here to...

25:22.305 --> 25:24.500
Well, I don't know,
I just wanted to see you again.

25:24.574 --> 25:26.201
Are you crazy?

25:26.275 --> 25:29.142
If Dad finds you,
he'll bury you under the patio!

25:29.178 --> 25:31.976
Find me. You kidding?
"Stealth" is my middle name.

25:37.653 --> 25:41.646
No! Quick! Turn it off!

25:41.724 --> 25:43.749
I'm trying!

25:46.729 --> 25:50.221
- Do something!
- The button's stuck! Come on.

25:52.835 --> 25:55.633
Aah! Juliet!

25:55.671 --> 25:57.571
It won't turn off!

25:57.640 --> 26:00.165
- There's something behind you!
- Shroom!

26:00.209 --> 26:01.699
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:01.777 --> 26:03.540
Juliet, what's with the...?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.972
Ooh! You look like a fun-gi.

26:08.017 --> 26:10.918
- Excuse me, a little help here.
- My dad's coming.

26:12.121 --> 26:13.713
So, you must be Gnomeo.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.384
Lovely to meet you... in the 30 seconds
before you're discovered and killed.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.155
- Quick, hide.
- Juliet,

26:19.195 --> 26:23.256
I've told you before,
no music in the grotto after 10:00.

26:25.034 --> 26:27.798
- What's going on here?
- Um...

26:27.837 --> 26:29.395
It was a... um...

26:29.472 --> 26:34.171
I saw a squirrel,
and he... he dropped his nuts.

26:34.210 --> 26:37.270
Yes, nuts, the size of... boulders!

26:37.346 --> 26:39.541
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.

26:39.582 --> 26:43.040
Well, OK, but no mucking about,
especially not tonight.

26:43.119 --> 26:46.145
We've been attacked, by a Blue!

26:46.188 --> 26:50.488
And if I ever get my hands on a Blue,
he'll be sleeping with the fishes!

26:52.395 --> 26:54.955
Now, I'm not a man
who is wounded up easily!

26:55.031 --> 26:57.226
Lord Redbrick,
I've been having problems with my...

26:57.266 --> 26:59.700
Your what?

26:59.769 --> 27:01.828
I guess this isn't
the best time to talk.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.361
- It's not ideal.
- But I...

27:03.406 --> 27:06.933
Just go. Please go.
...just came here to say I...

27:07.009 --> 27:08.840
- What? You what?
- I'm...

27:08.878 --> 27:11.108
- Oh, sorry.
- Juliet, is there something wrong

27:11.180 --> 27:13.546
- with the pond?
- The pond? No. What, this pond?

27:13.582 --> 27:16.107
No, it's fine. I mean,
it's just as pondy as ever.

27:16.185 --> 27:18.380
Oh, my gosh!
What is that thing over there?

27:18.421 --> 27:20.787
- What? What was it?
- The... thing, over there...

27:20.856 --> 27:23.290
- What did it look like?
- Oh, it looked like a really...

27:23.359 --> 27:26.385
OK, bye-bye then. Off you go.
Thanks for popping by.

27:26.429 --> 27:28.624
Good night, sweet prince,
and flights of angels...

27:28.698 --> 27:31.394
Or pigeons or sparrows or whatever.

27:31.434 --> 27:34.528
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

27:42.645 --> 27:44.135
Ah.

27:44.213 --> 27:46.408
Nanette, where's Gnomeo? Is he gone?

27:46.449 --> 27:48.815
- Yeah. Gone forever.
- What?!

27:51.987 --> 27:53.887
Whoa!

27:53.923 --> 27:57.825
I think you'll find this does,
actually, belong to you.

27:59.995 --> 28:02.463
Thank you.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.574
- I can't go.
- I know how you feel.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.944
No, really, I'm stuck.

28:23.552 --> 28:27.454
So, uh... can I see you again tomorrow?

28:27.490 --> 28:30.516
- Yes, but not here.
- Back in the old Lawrence place, then?

28:30.593 --> 28:32.117
- Noon?
- Not soon enough.

28:32.161 --> 28:34.527
- I can do 11:45.
- Done.

28:34.597 --> 28:38.863
That frog was right.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

28:41.570 --> 28:42.969
Whoa.

28:47.009 --> 28:48.169
Thanks, Nanette.

28:48.244 --> 28:51.008
You know he's going to ditch you
when he finds out how much you weigh.

28:53.115 --> 28:55.015
Shroom, do you see this face?

28:55.050 --> 28:59.146
It's a happy gnome face.
Now, come here. Come on!

29:23.712 --> 29:26.442
Outrage! Infamy!

29:26.515 --> 29:29.109
The gardening gloves are off then,
are they?

29:29.185 --> 29:31.176
You!
Wrecking my mower!

29:31.220 --> 29:34.451
Dear lady, you are insane
in the brain!

29:34.523 --> 29:37.515
I never thought
even you'd stoop to such levels!

29:37.560 --> 29:41.758
Oh, and by the way,
kindly stop stealing my underwear.

29:41.831 --> 29:45.767
In your dreams,
you daft old cabbage!

29:45.835 --> 29:49.703
Oh. How could she do this
to Tybalt's wishing well?

29:49.738 --> 29:54.539
Oh, my sweet little flower boy.
Why would anyone ever pick on you?

29:54.577 --> 29:56.272
Oh! Who thinks I should order

29:56.345 --> 30:01.339
the best new lawn mower money can buy?

30:02.251 --> 30:03.741
Oh...

30:09.258 --> 30:12.227
Why would anyone do this to Tybalt?

30:12.328 --> 30:14.421
Because nobody likes him.

30:14.463 --> 30:17.489
So, what are we going to do?

30:17.566 --> 30:19.796
Find their weak spots.

30:21.937 --> 30:23.427
Then what are we going to do?

30:24.206 --> 30:26.174
Damage.

30:26.242 --> 30:30.269
Lots and lots of damage.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.867
Right.
Mess with me, will you, Capulet?

30:52.935 --> 30:56.200
I'll show you, you old sack of compost.

30:56.272 --> 30:59.867
This is not over. Not by a long shot.

31:04.046 --> 31:06.344
Ah. Right. What do we got here?

31:06.415 --> 31:08.315
She's on the Worldy Widey Web.

31:08.384 --> 31:11.820
- Uh, no. No, no, don't think so.
- That one! Pick that one!

31:11.854 --> 31:15.017
- Ooh! That one! Yes, I like that one.
- No, don't think so.

31:15.090 --> 31:18.321
- No, no... That one!
- Oh! What's this?

31:18.394 --> 31:20.885
<i>Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>

31:20.963 --> 31:24.330
<i>Well, brother, maybe it's time</i>
<i>for a secret weapon.</i>

31:24.400 --> 31:26.368
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

31:26.435 --> 31:29.461
<i>It's the most ruthless, 500-horsepower,</i>

31:29.505 --> 31:33.805
<i>grass-dominating piece of hardware</i>
<i>the world has ever seen!</i>

31:33.842 --> 31:36.333
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

31:36.412 --> 31:41.816
<i>It's unnecessarily powerful!</i>
<i>Now with 75 percent more power!</i>

31:41.850 --> 31:43.340
- <i>It clears!</i>
- <i>Clears!</i>

31:43.419 --> 31:44.977
- <i>It digs!</i>
- <i>Digs!</i>

31:45.020 --> 31:46.885
- <i>It mows!</i>
- <i>Mows!</i>

31:46.956 --> 31:49.720
<i>Your lawn will be afraid to grow!</i>

31:49.792 --> 31:52.056
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

31:52.127 --> 31:55.494
<i>It's a weapon of grass destruction!</i>

31:55.531 --> 31:56.998
<i>Terrafirminator will not</i>
<i>inhibit grass from growing.</i>

31:57.032 --> 31:58.659
<i>Not recommended for residential use,</i>
<i>brother.</i>

31:58.701 --> 32:01.568
That one!

32:01.637 --> 32:03.332
Oh, my.

32:03.372 --> 32:06.000
Pick... that one!
Please, please, pick that one!

32:06.041 --> 32:08.066
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

32:08.844 --> 32:11.506
That's a bit in your face.

32:11.547 --> 32:14.141
This is more my speed.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.241
<i>Meow.</i>

32:15.317 --> 32:19.219
Oh! Not the Kitten Clipper! Oh, no.

32:28.998 --> 32:30.363
Definitely not.

32:51.487 --> 32:52.647
Huh?

32:59.762 --> 33:01.195
Ow!

34:02.891 --> 34:05.359
- Juliet? There you are.
- Hi, Dad.

34:05.427 --> 34:08.919
I've been ruminating
about our little discussion yesterday.

34:08.964 --> 34:12.866
- But I was just...
- What you need is compan-man-ship.

34:12.935 --> 34:15.495
Someone to look after you.
Who'll keep you safe.

34:15.571 --> 34:17.368
- What?
- You know Paris, don't you?

34:17.439 --> 34:18.701
Yes. Yes, of course. Why?

34:18.774 --> 34:21.675
- He's come to pay you a visitation.
- Dad!

34:21.710 --> 34:25.646
All right, all right. No one would ever
say I don't know when I'm not wanted.

34:25.681 --> 34:27.512
- Toodles!
- Got something for you.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.710
Here it is. Gypsophila. Lovely.

34:29.785 --> 34:31.548
What does it mean?
It means "lover of chalk."

34:31.620 --> 34:34.487
Although, ironically, it grows better
in a clay soil. It's weird.

34:34.523 --> 34:36.616
You think you got it down,
and then, bam, you do some reading,

34:36.658 --> 34:38.023
it turns out it likes clay soil,

34:38.060 --> 34:40.654
even though you thought it was
a lover of chalk. Weird.

34:40.696 --> 34:43.028
Right. Well, it's been
terribly nice speaking with you.

34:43.065 --> 34:46.159
Where are you going? Stop! No!
Obviously, do whatever you want.

34:46.268 --> 34:49.362
But my point was, surely, it's a bit
rude to leave me on a first date.

34:49.404 --> 34:50.837
- "First date"?
- Yeah.

34:50.939 --> 34:52.907
- I thought, what does a boyfriend...
- "Boyfriend"?

34:52.975 --> 34:54.772
Get his girlfriend?
"Girlfriend"?

34:54.843 --> 34:57.437
Ooh! This is good!

34:57.546 --> 34:59.411
A small token of my affection.

34:59.982 --> 35:01.745
Oh. Wow.

35:01.817 --> 35:04.718
Juliet, do you realize what this is?

35:04.753 --> 35:08.120
It is my own hybrid
of foxglove and buttercup...

35:08.223 --> 35:11.784
A love triangle!
...which I call "foxbutt."

35:11.860 --> 35:16.388
And you! I never knew you were
such a devil!

35:16.431 --> 35:18.865
No, I mean, you know,
I've got my dark side, sure.

35:19.668 --> 35:21.260
Hey there, Juliet.

35:21.336 --> 35:24.703
What a name. It's a great name.
Goes with your... eyes.

35:24.740 --> 35:27.573
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.

35:27.643 --> 35:29.941
Did it hurt when you fell down
from heaven?

35:30.012 --> 35:34.142
That's a killer, man.
Yeah, no. You're looking cool. Yeah.

35:34.249 --> 35:37.776
- How's it going with you, baby?
- Oh, I'm fine, baby. How are you?

35:37.853 --> 35:40.481
Uh... uh...
Never better.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.581
Huh?

35:45.761 --> 35:47.160
Do you think anyone heard that?

35:47.229 --> 35:48.594
There's nobody here.

35:48.664 --> 35:52.293
- Then why are you whispering?
- Why are you whispering?

35:53.468 --> 35:55.493
Oh! Look at that!

35:57.139 --> 35:59.164
Guess we're done
with the whispering thing then.

36:01.043 --> 36:04.911
It's a 1950s MacAllister Ranger.

36:04.947 --> 36:07.780
- Let's start her up!
- Yeah! OK.

36:07.816 --> 36:09.841
Check out the power on this beauty.

36:14.823 --> 36:17.417
She's empty. Bingo.

36:20.696 --> 36:22.857
- Hey, try this.
- Thanks.

36:51.827 --> 36:54.227
- Is that you?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.093
It's me, too!

37:01.270 --> 37:03.761
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

37:05.073 --> 37:08.167
OK, whatever you are, come out slowly!

37:08.210 --> 37:11.179
I have a loaded st... uh, weapon!

37:11.213 --> 37:13.773
And... And I'm not afraid to use it!

37:14.750 --> 37:16.980
- Do you think I scared him?
- Oh, definitely.

37:17.085 --> 37:19.110
I know I'm scared.

37:19.888 --> 37:22.550
Look at that baby, huh? Watch me now!

37:26.862 --> 37:31.925
By the way, thanks for finding my leg,
and setting me free. I love you!

37:32.034 --> 37:35.993
Do you know what it's like
to be trapped for 20 years?

37:36.104 --> 37:40.165
All alone by yourself,
no one for to talk at?

37:45.814 --> 37:47.213
"How's the other leg?"

37:47.249 --> 37:50.082
"I don't know, Featherstone, remember?
I don't have it."

37:50.152 --> 37:53.212
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?

37:53.255 --> 37:55.280
Sorry, but we didn't think
anybody lived here.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.620
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.719
- What if he follows us?
- Then our parents find out.

38:00.796 --> 38:04.254
Oh, no. Nanette was right. We're doomed!

38:05.901 --> 38:11.032
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes. Ho-ho!

38:11.073 --> 38:13.769
I think that you two are on a date.

38:13.842 --> 38:15.503
- Date? No! No.
- Date? No! No.

38:15.610 --> 38:18.238
- Not dating. Fighting.
- Fighting to the death.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.043
- Mortal enemies here.
- Yeah, don't you see it?

38:20.082 --> 38:22.516
- He's a Blue!
- And she's a Red!

38:22.551 --> 38:24.849
And I'm pink! Who cares?!

38:24.886 --> 38:26.945
Anyway, I got to ask.

38:27.022 --> 38:30.583
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?

38:30.625 --> 38:32.525
I know! I know!

38:32.561 --> 38:35.325
I be right back!

38:39.634 --> 38:42.102
Juliet, wait.

38:42.170 --> 38:45.196
Oh, here it comes.
I'm too delicate, right?

38:45.240 --> 38:48.641
No, no. I was going to say,
don't hold back. Let her rip.

38:48.710 --> 38:50.803
- Oh! Really?
- Yeah.

38:53.749 --> 38:54.943
Go!

38:57.452 --> 38:59.511
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

39:00.322 --> 39:02.586
Whoo!

39:07.963 --> 39:09.692
Wow!

39:12.734 --> 39:14.463
Ta-da!

39:14.536 --> 39:19.473
Look at that! It's a definite
improvement. Fantastic penmanship, too.

39:19.541 --> 39:22.908
But, you know, we still gotta do
something about these weeds.

39:22.944 --> 39:26.175
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.

39:26.248 --> 39:29.274
I don't know. Aweed by
any other name is still a weed.

39:29.317 --> 39:31.615
Go on. Make a wish and then blow on it.

39:37.559 --> 39:39.925
It's kind of hard with a beak, huh?

39:41.997 --> 39:45.592
Kind of tires you out, huh?
I go to sit down now.

39:48.170 --> 39:52.834
I've got a confession to make.
I've never actually driven a mower.

39:52.908 --> 39:54.341
No, you're a natural.

39:54.376 --> 39:58.813
Well, my dad,
he's a little overprotective.

40:06.488 --> 40:07.978
You know this is crazy, right?

40:08.690 --> 40:10.021
Yeah.

40:10.058 --> 40:12.424
I just never imagined
that I could fall for a Red.

40:12.594 --> 40:15.529
And me a Blue. No way.

40:15.597 --> 40:19.055
My whole life, my mum raised me
to hate you guys, you Reds.

40:19.134 --> 40:21.364
So, this could never work.

40:22.938 --> 40:24.098
Could it?

40:24.172 --> 40:28.040
Well, a Red and a Blue,
it just can't be.

40:28.076 --> 40:30.237
Can it?

40:30.312 --> 40:33.770
Look!
It's kind of like snowing, but it's not.

40:34.649 --> 40:38.585
Oh, baby, you know, I getting into this
now. See, the trick is to go like...

40:38.653 --> 40:40.780
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...

40:42.157 --> 40:47.720
Ah! I wish that we could all come back
and do this tomorrow.

40:47.762 --> 40:50.890
And, uh... I promise,

40:50.966 --> 40:53.400
your secret is safe with me.

40:54.503 --> 40:56.334
Well, should we?

40:56.371 --> 40:58.669
I can do 11:45.

40:58.707 --> 41:00.265
Not soon enough.

41:20.795 --> 41:23.263
Hey, Shroom. What's up, button head?

41:23.331 --> 41:26.562
Careful there. You're going to chip
something. What's eating you?

41:32.340 --> 41:34.570
How? How?

41:36.111 --> 41:37.976
- Mum!
- Gnomeo!

41:38.046 --> 41:42.039
How could this have happened?
Where were you?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.414
I was...

41:44.920 --> 41:46.410
I was nowhere.

41:48.223 --> 41:50.316
Don't worry, Mum.
I'll make it up to you.

41:50.392 --> 41:53.589
How?! Redbrick and his hoodlums
have destroyed

41:53.628 --> 41:57.120
the most beautiful thing
we Blues have.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.834
Your father planted her.

42:00.902 --> 42:03.928
We raised her from a seedling.

42:11.246 --> 42:15.307
Those blasted Reds! Come on, Gnomeo!
We'll make them pay!

42:17.919 --> 42:20.217
Every last one of them!

42:27.762 --> 42:30.094
Every last one?

42:44.946 --> 42:46.811
My dad can really pick them.

42:46.848 --> 42:48.440
Can't he just?

42:48.516 --> 42:51.974
- Oh! This is painful.
- Oh! Sweet torture.

43:12.674 --> 43:16.542
- Ooh, shiny, shiny.
- Nanette?

43:27.355 --> 43:28.583
Gnomeo.

43:39.134 --> 43:40.499
OK.

43:59.954 --> 44:01.979
Huh?

44:13.101 --> 44:15.934
Juliet, no, wait!
I... I...

44:20.375 --> 44:23.640
A Blue! A Blue!

44:23.712 --> 44:25.942
- Abort, abort the mission!
- What, what happened?

44:25.980 --> 44:27.811
Uh... The nozzle jammed. Let's go.

44:35.924 --> 44:38.119
Gnomeo?

44:44.332 --> 44:45.663
Hmm...

44:50.538 --> 44:54.941
Such a big hat
for such a small gnome.

44:54.976 --> 44:58.139
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?

44:58.213 --> 45:00.681
Let's take this baby out into the alley.

45:00.749 --> 45:02.114
Then what are we going to do?

45:02.150 --> 45:06.109
We're going to have a smashing time.

45:08.556 --> 45:11.184
Aw, come on, Juliet.
It's not as bad as all that.

45:11.259 --> 45:12.920
Is that your big move on a second date?

45:12.961 --> 45:15.828
You wine them, dine them,
and then spray them with weedkiller?

45:15.897 --> 45:17.694
You've got to admit, it is original.

45:17.766 --> 45:20.132
Hola!
My fellow funsters are back already.

45:20.235 --> 45:24.365
Juliet, be reasonable! I didn't have
a choice after "Incident Wisteria."

45:24.439 --> 45:26.839
How do you think that looks?
Just a toilet, in the middle of a yard,

45:26.908 --> 45:29.342
with nothing growing out of it.

45:29.377 --> 45:32.175
- You Blues are so infuriating!
- Wait a minute. Us Blues?

45:32.247 --> 45:34.943
- So, what you guys want to do?
- Featherstone, we're busy!

45:35.049 --> 45:37.313
Come on, guys! Let us have some fun!

45:37.352 --> 45:40.321
Let me tell you something
about you Reds.

45:40.355 --> 45:41.515
Us Reds?

45:41.589 --> 45:45.821
Can't we all just laugh about this?
I know your little mushroom dude can.

45:45.860 --> 45:47.191
- Featherstone!
- Featherstone!

45:47.262 --> 45:48.889
- We're in the middle of something!
- You wouldn't understand.

45:48.963 --> 45:50.828
- Do you mind?
- Just leave us alone!

45:53.067 --> 45:56.093
Right. I'm sorry.

45:57.539 --> 46:01.703
You know, sometime
I get a little overexcited.

46:01.743 --> 46:06.976
Especially having such
great new friends. Like you, and...

46:07.081 --> 46:10.642
But I know I can be a bit... much.

46:14.422 --> 46:16.253
Wait, Featherstone. Hey...

46:16.324 --> 46:18.690
Come back,
Featherstone. I'm sorry.

46:59.467 --> 47:04.734
I may not be
a smart bird, but I know what love is.

47:07.242 --> 47:10.370
# <i>You hear it everyday</i>

47:10.411 --> 47:13.710
# <i>Once upon a time, they say</i>

47:14.415 --> 47:17.942
# <i>Once upon a time in this place</i>

47:18.019 --> 47:21.455
# <i>I looked and saw on your face</i>

47:21.489 --> 47:24.322
# <i>A smile that spoke to me</i>

47:24.392 --> 47:27.850
# <i>In oh so many ways</i>

47:27.929 --> 47:31.194
# <i>And love built a garden</i>

47:31.266 --> 47:34.963
# <i>Grew it from the ground up</i>

47:35.036 --> 47:38.005
# <i>Each one of us knowing</i>

47:38.072 --> 47:41.667
# <i>Every inch of it was us</i>

47:41.743 --> 47:44.837
# <i>We pulled it all together</i>

47:44.913 --> 47:48.212
# <i>Hoping and believing</i>

47:48.283 --> 47:51.309
# <i>That love built this garden</i>

47:51.386 --> 47:56.688
# <i>For the two of us to dream in</i>

48:03.197 --> 48:06.166
# <i>We'd get a little rain</i>

48:06.200 --> 48:09.431
# <i>Then the sun came out again</i>

48:09.804 --> 48:13.205
# <i>But a frost, it's hard to fight</i>

48:13.274 --> 48:16.243
# <i>Once it takes hold, flowers die</i>

48:16.311 --> 48:19.576
# <i>There's only so much you can do</i>

48:19.647 --> 48:23.048
# <i>To keep some things alive</i>

48:23.117 --> 48:26.177
# <i>And love built a garden</i>

48:26.220 --> 48:29.986
# <i>Grew it from the ground up</i>

48:30.024 --> 48:33.118
# <i>Each one of us knowing</i>

48:33.161 --> 48:35.994
# <i>Every inch of it was us</i>

48:36.831 --> 48:40.323
# <i>We pulled it all together</i>

48:40.368 --> 48:43.701
# <i>Hoping and believing</i>

48:43.771 --> 48:46.672
# <i>That love built this garden</i>

48:46.774 --> 48:50.471
# <i>For the two of us to dream in</i> #.

49:05.660 --> 49:09.096
You know, other people's hate

49:09.163 --> 49:13.259
destroyed my love, and...

49:13.334 --> 49:16.064
I couldn't do nothing about it.

49:19.273 --> 49:22.242
But you... you can.

49:31.519 --> 49:36.047
You know, I think that
crazy pink plastic bird might be right.

49:36.157 --> 49:38.625
What if we never went back?

49:38.693 --> 49:41.924
Never go back? But what about my dad?

49:41.963 --> 49:44.124
And Nanette? And the Red garden?

49:44.198 --> 49:47.099
You see, the truth is,
over there, we're enemies.

49:47.168 --> 49:50.228
But here? Here, we're a matching pair.

49:51.906 --> 49:57.276
Juliet, will you stay here
and build a garden with me?

49:57.311 --> 49:59.245
I'd love to.

50:30.645 --> 50:32.636
Gnomeo!

50:34.015 --> 50:35.676
What are you doing?!

50:37.618 --> 50:40.712
Benny! Listen, mate, I can explain.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.153
Benny! Benny, wait!

50:48.696 --> 50:53.861
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little Big Hat Benny!

50:54.669 --> 50:57.934
Mess with our garden, will you?

51:04.378 --> 51:05.970
Benny!

51:06.848 --> 51:08.475
No!

51:13.588 --> 51:15.715
Ooh! That felt good.

51:16.524 --> 51:18.754
Oh, no. Oh, no!

51:20.628 --> 51:21.890
Tybalt!

51:27.068 --> 51:28.433
A hat for a hat!

51:31.506 --> 51:32.996
Gnomeo, no!

51:45.753 --> 51:48.984
You wouldn't attack
an unarmed gnome, would you?

51:50.224 --> 51:51.691
Sucker!

51:53.094 --> 51:54.322
Pity!

51:56.330 --> 51:58.059
Tybalt! The wall!

51:58.099 --> 52:02.229
You don't think I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do you? What wall?

52:07.842 --> 52:09.605
Oh. That wall.

52:10.378 --> 52:12.141
No.

52:14.448 --> 52:16.348
- What was that?
- What's happened?

52:20.788 --> 52:22.221
Tybalt?

52:22.256 --> 52:25.817
Tybalt. Tybalt?

52:28.896 --> 52:32.161
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.

52:39.907 --> 52:42.171
Ooh.

52:42.243 --> 52:44.074
Smash him back!

52:44.612 --> 52:45.840
No!

52:45.913 --> 52:48.177
What is the meaning
of all this constipation?

52:48.249 --> 52:50.274
Gnomeo smashed Tybalt!

52:50.351 --> 52:52.581
- No! He didn't do it!
- Juliet!

52:52.620 --> 52:53.985
- Gnomeo!
- Mum!

52:54.055 --> 52:56.250
A gnome for a gnome!

52:57.625 --> 52:59.684
- Catch!
- What?

53:05.967 --> 53:07.798
Smash him back!

53:08.302 --> 53:10.634
Run, Gnomeo! Run!

53:13.307 --> 53:14.672
Stop! Stop that!

53:24.919 --> 53:26.511
Revenge!

53:27.755 --> 53:29.222
Oh?

53:46.073 --> 53:48.200
Oh...

54:03.190 --> 54:05.590
- What are you doing?
- No! I love him!

54:05.660 --> 54:08.128
- What?
- Doomed.

54:08.162 --> 54:09.789
Oh! Someone do something.

54:17.972 --> 54:19.599
Gnomeo!

54:20.775 --> 54:22.265
Are you mad?

54:22.343 --> 54:24.538
There's been enough
smashing for one day!

54:24.578 --> 54:28.810
Now get her on her pedestal
and keep her there!

54:28.849 --> 54:30.544
He's gone.

54:30.584 --> 54:33.280
Oh, no... gone.

54:36.524 --> 54:39.891
Oh, Gnomeo. No...

54:39.927 --> 54:42.760
No, not Gnomeo.

54:42.830 --> 54:44.388
Let's get you home, now.

54:44.465 --> 54:47.628
Oh! My poor, poor boy.

55:12.493 --> 55:14.518
Hmm?

55:16.063 --> 55:17.928
Stay. Stay!

55:17.965 --> 55:19.057
Good boy!

55:21.435 --> 55:23.903
Shroom! Shroom!

56:10.217 --> 56:12.583
Huh?

56:20.795 --> 56:22.126
No!

56:34.842 --> 56:37.174
Hey, what's this? A gnome?

56:37.244 --> 56:39.212
Yeah, mate.
It looks like your sister.

56:42.049 --> 56:43.880
Whoa! Don't drop it!

56:45.619 --> 56:47.314
Come on, pass it!

57:06.841 --> 57:09.435
You left me no choice, Juliet.

57:09.510 --> 57:13.310
I've lost your mother.
I am not going to lose you.

58:33.794 --> 58:36.160
Psst! Psst! Bunnies! Fall in.

58:36.964 --> 58:41.264
All right. We've got to avenge Gnomeo.
Here's what we're going to do. Now...

58:43.904 --> 58:45.599
No, not now, Shroom!

58:47.508 --> 58:48.873
Right. Got it!

59:04.325 --> 59:07.351
OK. OK! Little mushroom dude,
I'm coming.

59:07.428 --> 59:09.419
What? What are you trying to say?

59:10.998 --> 59:13.762
So, Little Timmy has fallen
down the well?

59:13.801 --> 59:15.428
No? Little John?

59:15.469 --> 59:17.835
Little Mustafa? Little Richard? What?!

59:21.442 --> 59:24.434
Oh. Ateapot fell down the well.

59:26.280 --> 59:27.440
What?

59:28.549 --> 59:30.380
Gnomeo.

59:30.451 --> 59:33.249
You saying Gnomeo fell down the well?

59:33.320 --> 59:36.847
No, little mushroom, he was smashed.

59:36.890 --> 59:38.790
I saw it myself.

59:40.995 --> 59:44.226
What? You want I still should
follow you some more. OK, fine.

59:44.298 --> 59:49.326
I going with you. I go. But what this
has to do with Gnomeo, I don't know.

59:49.370 --> 59:52.237
And where is this well
everyone is falling into?

1:00:02.883 --> 1:00:05.215
Psst!

1:00:12.126 --> 1:00:13.593
Hmm?

1:00:17.865 --> 1:00:19.730
Ready?

1:00:26.373 --> 1:00:28.204
Ew.

1:00:28.242 --> 1:00:30.608
Hmm?

1:00:32.413 --> 1:00:34.278
Yuck!

1:00:37.818 --> 1:00:38.944
Hmm?

1:00:44.358 --> 1:00:46.519
Ooh! Hello.

1:00:57.404 --> 1:00:59.372
Whoa!

1:01:14.521 --> 1:01:16.148
Hmm?

1:01:54.561 --> 1:01:55.789
<i>Meow.</i>

1:02:00.134 --> 1:02:02.500
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

1:02:02.569 --> 1:02:05.629
- <i>Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>
- Never!

1:02:05.672 --> 1:02:08.163
<i>Well, brother,</i>
<i>maybe it's time for a secret weapon!</i>

1:02:08.242 --> 1:02:11.734
- Bring it on.
- <i>Terrafirminator!</i>

1:02:11.812 --> 1:02:13.939
This one's for Gnomeo!

1:02:14.782 --> 1:02:16.545
<i>Meow!</i>

1:02:56.990 --> 1:02:59.117
Huh?

1:02:59.927 --> 1:03:01.451
Yeah!

1:03:01.528 --> 1:03:04.361
Huh?

1:03:08.902 --> 1:03:10.369
Come on!

1:03:13.574 --> 1:03:15.599
Oh! Ruddy purse.

1:03:24.251 --> 1:03:25.616
Call me.

1:03:28.322 --> 1:03:32.884
So Juliet and me, we decided
that we'd carry on in spite of the feud.

1:03:32.926 --> 1:03:36.020
It was great, but then my best mate
Benny found out,

1:03:36.063 --> 1:03:38.793
and then Tybalt,
who's a right piece of work by the way,

1:03:38.866 --> 1:03:40.959
crashed a trowel through Benny's hat.

1:03:41.034 --> 1:03:45.801
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed,

1:03:45.873 --> 1:03:49.502
which wasn't my fault,
and I was chased out.

1:03:50.210 --> 1:03:55.045
Exiled. Stuck up here on your head,
far away from Juliet.

1:03:56.683 --> 1:03:58.116
Extraordinary.

1:03:58.151 --> 1:04:02.781
Your story, it does
put me in mind of another.

1:04:02.823 --> 1:04:03.983
It does?

1:04:04.057 --> 1:04:07.322
Oh! Indeed! Yes, there are
remarkable similarities.

1:04:07.394 --> 1:04:09.055
What happens?
Do they get back together then?

1:04:09.096 --> 1:04:13.465
Get back together?
Um... No, not exactly.

1:04:13.500 --> 1:04:15.263
What exactly do you mean?

1:04:15.302 --> 1:04:18.965
Well now, it really is quite good.

1:04:19.039 --> 1:04:21.132
She feigns her death.

1:04:21.174 --> 1:04:25.133
He finds her, thinks her dead,
takes his own life.

1:04:25.178 --> 1:04:28.841
She wakes, finds him dead,
takes her life, both dead.

1:04:28.916 --> 1:04:33.683
<i>Exeunt omnes,</i> the end, curtain!
Standing ovation!

1:04:33.754 --> 1:04:37.485
Bravo! Bravo! Author! Author!

1:04:38.725 --> 1:04:39.885
Hmm.

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.520
What did you say?!
They both die?!

1:04:42.596 --> 1:04:44.427
What kind of an ending is that?

1:04:44.464 --> 1:04:46.364
My dear boy, this is a tragedy.

1:04:46.433 --> 1:04:48.526
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish!

1:04:48.602 --> 1:04:51.002
- "Rubbish"?
- Gotta be a better ending than that!

1:04:51.071 --> 1:04:54.336
I suppose that he could've
made it back in time

1:04:54.408 --> 1:04:58.845
to avert disaster,
but I like the whole death part better.

1:04:59.346 --> 1:05:00.711
Oh, dear.

1:05:07.621 --> 1:05:08.918
Whoo-hoo!

1:05:08.989 --> 1:05:10.684
Featherstone!

1:05:11.558 --> 1:05:12.855
One word!

1:05:14.094 --> 1:05:15.561
Plastic.

1:05:15.629 --> 1:05:17.460
How did you find me? Shroom!

1:05:17.497 --> 1:05:21.331
He sniffed you out.
And he doesn't have a nose. I checked.

1:05:21.368 --> 1:05:23.700
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head!

1:05:23.770 --> 1:05:26.170
What is it, boy?

1:05:26.206 --> 1:05:29.004
He hasn't stopped, yakety-yakety-yak!

1:05:29.042 --> 1:05:31.033
He's been going on and on and on
since the alley.

1:05:31.111 --> 1:05:34.569
Chocolates in stranger, chocolates
in stranger, chocolates in stranger...

1:05:34.648 --> 1:05:36.479
Juliet's in danger?!

1:05:36.516 --> 1:05:40.282
No, that's not it. Juliet's in danger!

1:05:40.354 --> 1:05:41.514
Told you so.

1:05:41.555 --> 1:05:45.218
Come on, boys. I've got to get
back to Juliet and save her!

1:05:45.258 --> 1:05:49.217
That's what he said,
but she was dead before he got home!

1:05:49.262 --> 1:05:51.059
We'll see about that!

1:05:53.934 --> 1:05:55.765
Whoa!

1:06:15.689 --> 1:06:16.849
Ta-da!

1:06:20.494 --> 1:06:21.927
Benny.

1:06:21.962 --> 1:06:25.659
What do you think, Lady B?
This baby is fully equipped.

1:06:25.732 --> 1:06:26.926
Equipped for what?

1:06:26.967 --> 1:06:30.801
It has settings for edging,
trimming, mulching,

1:06:30.871 --> 1:06:32.566
and revenge!

1:06:35.509 --> 1:06:38.876
Do it, Benny. Do anything it takes!

1:06:38.912 --> 1:06:42.473
Make them rue
the day they destroyed my son!

1:06:44.651 --> 1:06:47.950
Unleash the dogs of war!

1:06:56.663 --> 1:07:01.623
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1:07:01.668 --> 1:07:04.466
<i>five, four, three,</i>

1:07:04.538 --> 1:07:07.006
<i>two, one!</i>

1:07:17.784 --> 1:07:19.376
No! No!

1:07:26.927 --> 1:07:28.019
Oh!

1:07:30.964 --> 1:07:32.295
Yes!

1:07:37.571 --> 1:07:39.163
Oh, no!

1:07:40.707 --> 1:07:42.675
Oh, blimey!

1:07:49.316 --> 1:07:51.216
Oh, no!

1:07:55.489 --> 1:07:57.150
Attack!

1:07:57.190 --> 1:07:59.090
Counterattack!

1:08:00.494 --> 1:08:02.052
Counter-counterattack!

1:08:07.934 --> 1:08:10.402
- Fire!
- Incoming!

1:08:17.878 --> 1:08:19.539
Hey! I got one!

1:08:19.613 --> 1:08:21.103
Thank you!

1:08:25.819 --> 1:08:27.218
Move it!

1:08:27.687 --> 1:08:28.984
No!

1:08:34.227 --> 1:08:36.252
No! Paris!

1:08:42.068 --> 1:08:45.560
Gentlemen, I suggest
we put our heads together. Charge!

1:08:50.677 --> 1:08:54.010
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Yee-haw!

1:08:56.883 --> 1:08:59.215
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

1:09:03.223 --> 1:09:05.157
Whoa!

1:09:06.126 --> 1:09:07.821
Thanks!

1:09:14.901 --> 1:09:16.459
Juliet!

1:09:17.771 --> 1:09:19.432
You're alive!

1:09:19.472 --> 1:09:22.305
- Come with me.
- OK.

1:09:22.776 --> 1:09:23.902
Oh, no.

1:09:27.714 --> 1:09:29.079
No, no!

1:09:39.893 --> 1:09:41.918
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>a complete destruction now?</i>

1:09:41.962 --> 1:09:43.327
<i>Destruction in progress.</i>

1:09:55.775 --> 1:09:58.073
Get him! Come on! Come on!

1:10:01.581 --> 1:10:03.276
Come on, come on, come on!

1:10:25.272 --> 1:10:26.864
Juliet!

1:10:26.940 --> 1:10:29.033
My son! It can't be.

1:10:31.978 --> 1:10:33.536
<i>Target locked.</i>

1:10:34.514 --> 1:10:37.540
She's going to blow!
Get back! Get back!

1:10:48.762 --> 1:10:49.922
It's no use.

1:10:49.996 --> 1:10:51.657
Go.

1:10:53.566 --> 1:10:56.729
- Go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:08.477
Told you so.

1:11:42.549 --> 1:11:44.278
Huh?

1:12:03.837 --> 1:12:05.202
No.

1:12:31.331 --> 1:12:32.821
Huh?

1:12:36.336 --> 1:12:38.327
It's OK! I'm OK!

1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:41.903
Oh, good.

1:12:46.112 --> 1:12:48.012
I'm sorry about your son.

1:12:48.815 --> 1:12:51.306
I'm sorry about your daughter.

1:12:51.351 --> 1:12:54.912
I was just trying to keep her safe.

1:12:54.954 --> 1:12:59.653
And now, the whole thing is my fault.

1:13:00.927 --> 1:13:03.327
Our fault.

1:13:23.583 --> 1:13:25.847
This feud...

1:13:25.919 --> 1:13:27.546
Is over.

1:13:38.465 --> 1:13:39.625
Move!

1:14:22.842 --> 1:14:24.776
I don't know about you, but...

1:14:24.844 --> 1:14:27.369
I think this ending is much better.

1:14:37.090 --> 1:14:40.423
- Good afternoon, witch.
- Nitwit!

1:16:56.929 --> 1:16:58.829
Thank you!
