MALE NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

00:05.964 --> 00:07.049
I'm through.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.425
See you on the other side.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.223
It can't be done.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.099
We're not getting out of here.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.311
There's only one person
who can really stop this execution.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.271
Would you talk to your father for me?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.608
I'm the last person in the world
that my father listens to.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.986
The Governor has reviewed your case.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.905
He's not granting clemency.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.448
Let's proceed.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.201
I came in here a man.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.745
Give me the strength
to walk out of here a man.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.327
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:02.623 --> 02:05.000
Doctor, you can leave now.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.390
It's him.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.977
Michael.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.647
What's he saying?

02:27.189 --> 02:29.441
Michael, turn around.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.027
It's him.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.987
What do you think he's saying?

02:34.071 --> 02:36.365
Michael, turn around.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.091
(PHONE BEEPING)

03:03.517 --> 03:06.228
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.106
What's happening?

03:11.775 --> 03:13.944
What the hell's going on in there?

03:48.645 --> 03:52.149
I can't tell you how sorry I am
that you've had to go through all of this.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.656
Lincoln.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.458
What happened in there?

04:09.541 --> 04:12.836
Judge Kessler called.
The execution's been delayed.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.171
What do you mean delayed?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.173
Apparently, some new evidence
has come to light.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.341
- What evidence?
- I don't understand.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.761
How long do we have? One day, two days?

04:20.844 --> 04:23.930
That's all the information
I have at the moment. I'm sorry.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.267
I'll give you a minute.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.060
You Okay?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.774
I need to know how much time we have.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.610
I'll go and see the judge and find out.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.823
You're with Michael. You'll be okay.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.244
- Did you see him?
- Who?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.914
- The guy in the viewing room.
- No.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.375
It was Dad.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.880
It was Dad.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.918
It was him. I know it was.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.003
That's not possible, Linc.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.089
It is possible. I saw him.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.424
I don't know how you could have.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.718
There were only half a dozen people
in that room.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.972
Me, Veronica and a bunch of reporters.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.016
- He wasn't there.
- You don't know that.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.102
I do. I would have recognized him.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.896
You don't remember what he looks like.
I do.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.233
This is a man who took off,
what, 30 years ago?

05:59.609 --> 06:03.113
Why would he come back now,
at the very last minute?

06:03.947 --> 06:04.948
(SIGHING)

06:05.156 --> 06:06.491
I don't know.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.661
REYNOLDS: Why is he still alive?

06:10.120 --> 06:14.291
It appears that some information
was anonymously slipped to the judge.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.750
Anonymously?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.670
It was your fat little friend, Hale.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.423
- If you had taken care of him sooner...
- It wasn't Hale.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.133
How do you know that?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.093
If Hale had given Veronica Donovan

06:25.176 --> 06:27.053
anything that could have
gotten a stay of execution,

06:27.137 --> 06:30.515
I think she would have brought it up
when she made her argument in court.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.850
It didn't come from him.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.435
Well, who else on your end knows?

06:33.518 --> 06:36.146
Who else on your end knows?
Why all the finger-pointing at us?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.940
Are you sure that the leak didn't come
from your end? From the company?

06:39.024 --> 06:42.319
Hey, we are all
on the same team, remember?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.487
Absolutely.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.118
Just find the leak and plug it.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.748
Thank you, ma'am.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.086
One more thing.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.215
The next time you're in my office,

07:04.299 --> 07:07.218
I expect you to stand
when you're addressing me.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.096
Absolutely.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.730
All I can tell is
I was working late in chambers,

07:18.813 --> 07:20.273
I left at 11100,

07:20.649 --> 07:23.026
and there it was, right under my door.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.363
One is Terrence Steadman's
autopsy report.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.200
In it, his appendix is noted
as present and unremarkable.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.869
The other paper is an operative report

07:32.953 --> 07:35.288
from when Mr. Steadman
was 12 years old.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.916
The procedure was an appendectomy.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.752
That's impossible. Let me see this.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.212
I want the conviction overturned

07:42.295 --> 07:44.422
and Lincoln Burrows
immediately released from custody.

07:44.506 --> 07:48.301
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
These records haven't even been certified.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.678
The hospital can tell you.

07:49.761 --> 07:53.264
The hospital does not keep records
going back that far. I checked.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.474
So as far as we know,

07:54.557 --> 07:57.978
these documents could be a hoax
from some anti-death penalty advocate

07:58.061 --> 08:00.105
or, dare I say it, defense counsel.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.856
Oh, please. You're preposterous.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.234
Let's just all
take a deep breath here, okay?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.860
I don't know what these papers mean

08:05.944 --> 08:08.488
and for that reason,
I'd like to err on the side of caution.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.616
I'm going to delay the execution
for two weeks.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.328
That should give us more than enough
time to exhume the body.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.038
Exhume the body.

08:17.122 --> 08:21.084
Your Honor, all due respect,
that is a drastic measure.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.253
It's also the only way we're going to know

08:23.336 --> 08:26.089
if that body in the ground
is really Terrence Steadman.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.155
So, that body, what if it's him?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.449
Well, I'm not going to sit around hoping.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.285
What does that mean?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.246
It means we get back to work.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.582
God, I was hoping you would say that.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.293
They're digging up the body, huh?

09:04.002 --> 09:07.630
To be honest, I've never been
in a situation like this before.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.259
If nothing else, you can be glad

09:11.342 --> 09:15.138
that you've got people who'll go
to extreme lengths to get you out of here.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.848
No kidding.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.144
Warden,

09:24.189 --> 09:28.151
at the execution,
there was a man in the viewing room.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.489
Just wondering if you or anyone
in the prison had spoken to him.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.493
Well, according to this,

09:37.827 --> 09:41.539
those present were your brother,
his attorney and three reporters,

09:41.956 --> 09:43.583
two women and a man.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.627
The man, who was he?

09:47.045 --> 09:49.339
<i>He was from The Headline Press.</i>

09:49.756 --> 09:51.091
William Prall.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.510

in all that ink?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.286

10:21.121 --> 10:23.790
- You don't know those plans by now?
- No.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.794
Memorizing it would be like
memorizing the phone book.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.547
Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?

Contingencies?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.390
- You saying you found another way?
- Maybe.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.225
What do you mean, maybe?

10:42.308 --> 10:45.603

but it's suicide.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.086
We're still going out through the infirmary

11:10.170 --> 11:12.130
and we're still going to do it
from the guards' room.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.757
It's just the in-between
that's gonna have to change.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.843
Now wait a minute.
Why are you changing the plan, man?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.845
We're already through that room
beneath the infirmary.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.431
That's all we gotta do is get through
that pipe and we're home free.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.309
There's a reason they replaced it
with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.935
People can't get through it.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.771
The only way we're getting
into that infirmary is from beneath.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.107
We're going to have to find another way.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.152
The psych ward?

11:34.235 --> 11:37.113
It's the only building that shares
a subsurface line with the infirmary.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.948
You telling me,

11:39.032 --> 11:42.452
to get to the infirmary
we gotta go through the whack shack?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.037
Unless you got a better idea.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.747
And there's a subsurface line

11:45.830 --> 11:48.625
that runs from the guards' room
to the psych ward?

11:48.708 --> 11:49.959
Sort of.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.253
Oh, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean "sort of"?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.380
We can go into that hole
in the guards' room.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.426
About 40 yards up Route 66, there's
a grate and that'll get us halfway there.

11:58.843 --> 12:02.096
- And what about the rest of the way?
- We gotta do it above ground.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.390
Oh, so it's just a bunch of cons

12:04.474 --> 12:07.310

for all the guards to see?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.436
Yep.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.148
You're right. It is suicide.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.825
This grate that you're talking about,
it's hidden, right, partner?

- The COs can't see it.
- Not exactly.

- Well, where is it?
- You're standing on it.

Oh, he's cool.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.223
You get caught with this, they'll kill you.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.726

16:16.809 --> 16:19.479

It's the cement we dug up.

My God, you cons are slower
than a spelling bee full of stutterers.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.982
You all think you can slow-walk this job?
Play grab-ass in here?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.650

17:48.150 --> 17:49.652

17:49.735 --> 17:51.112

17:53.531 --> 17:55.283

18:11.424 --> 18:15.553

don't know how things work around here.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.651
I like it.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.578

18:51.047 --> 18:52.465
Oh, man.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.384
What are we gonna do with this?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.347
It was Ole Miss, right? Ole Miss?

18:59.430 --> 19:02.475
- Nah, it was a Midwestern school.
-Iowa.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.727
No, not Iowa. Hold on a sec.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.063
Hey, Bagwell.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.741
Hey, do you know what school
Art Schlichter played for?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.454
Not really sure there, boss.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.838
I really ain't much of a football guy, boss.
Too much violence.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.757
Come on, you know the guy
I'm talking about.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.134
Art Schlichter, the quarterback,
got nailed for gambling.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.553

20:15.715 --> 20:17.341
Any more vomiting?

20:18.008 --> 20:20.636
Just nauseous. Must be the nerves.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
That's understandable, considering.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.142
- I can give you something for it.
- No, that's fine.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.686
All right.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.606
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.820
- Can I ask you a question, Doc?
- Yeah. What?

20:38.112 --> 20:41.198
With all that went down yesterday,
head pounding, heart racing,

20:41.282 --> 20:43.868
could that cause me
to see something that wasn't there?

20:43.951 --> 20:46.537
Yeah. Yeah, anxiety attacks are often

20:46.620 --> 20:49.540
accompanied by
flashes of light, black spots...

20:49.623 --> 20:51.000
No,no,no.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.544
I saw someone in the viewing room.

20:54.462 --> 20:58.090
- There were people there.
- This person couldn't have been there.

21:00.843 --> 21:04.638
Yeah, Lincoln, you've heard of,
post-traumatic stress disorder, right?

21:04.972 --> 21:06.015
Yeah.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.017
I'm gonna call you a prime candidate.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.936
I don't think a lot of people
have been through what you just did.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.689
So if you thought you saw someone,

21:13.773 --> 21:17.234
it's possible that it was your subconscious
giving you what you wanted,

21:17.318 --> 21:19.028
whoever it was that

21:19.403 --> 21:23.282
you wanted to be there with you
in that moment to comfort you.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.455
Who was it you thought you saw?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.377
Thanks, Doc. Thank you.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.674
Sure thing.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.816
Seen a lot of rackets in my time,

21:57.566 --> 22:00.486
but if you're doing what I think
you're doing with those postcards,

22:00.569 --> 22:02.822
yours definitely takes the cake.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.199
Yeah, how about
saving the small talk, old head,

22:05.282 --> 22:07.743
'cause you and I
ain't got nothing in common.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.328
What do you do?

22:09.912 --> 22:12.873
Write them here
and then send them to a pal in Iraq

22:12.957 --> 22:15.626
and have him mail them your wife's way?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.712
You know, why don't you
just shut your word hole?

22:18.796 --> 22:20.840
'Cause you don't know nothing
about my racket.

he ain't in the hole to his family.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.136
I seen that once or twice.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.638
But Iraq?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.057
Yeah, you the one to talk.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.143
Dede, is that your wife or your kid?

22:34.436 --> 22:36.105
Now you listen,

22:36.188 --> 22:39.191
I don't even want you
to say her name in this prison.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.568
You feel me?

22:42.069 --> 22:43.404
A daughter.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.198
Definitely a daughter.

22:49.368 --> 22:53.455
- Yeah, what do you know?
-'Cause I got one myself.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.751

after you break outside these walls,

22:58.043 --> 23:00.629

they're gonna look for you.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.845
that I'm that dumb
that I would go directly there?

23:07.928 --> 23:11.390

I'm gonna go.

something in common after all.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.494

23:32.578 --> 23:35.205
Keep your eye on him. Watch him closely.

23:36.123 --> 23:39.668

But he's always working at it.

favorite player. Work ethic.

23:57.728 --> 23:58.979
You know him?

24:03.275 --> 24:05.986
The pipe system
beneath the psych ward is...

24:06.695 --> 24:08.447
Well, it's complex.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.866

24:12.034 --> 24:15.204
- How complex can it be?
- Very.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.876
When they built this place in 1858,
the pipes were lead.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.921
A century later,
they discovered lead was a health risk

24:24.004 --> 24:27.049
so they went to copper.
They never removed the lead pipes.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.968
Cost too much.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.553
There's thousands of yards
of the stuff still down there.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.306
And then a few years ago,
they switched to industrial plastic.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.434
Again, it was cheaper
just to lay it over the old stuff.

24:38.227 --> 24:42.189
If I make a wrong turn down there tonight,
I won't make it back by count.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.568
Well, you won't make
the wrong turn, right?

With decomposition this extensive,

31:43.402 --> 31:47.072
the most accurate identification tool
is dental records.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.658

of the deceased's teeth

31:49.741 --> 31:53.161

I'll have you sent back to your cell.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.781
All yours.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.627
Hey, Katie, it's me.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.004
Listen, can you come up to my office
for a second?

38:18.087 --> 38:19.798
I got something I wanna show you.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.092
What the hell am I gonna do now?
I'm a dead man.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.428
I'm sorry, cuz. It was an accident.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.306
Bull's gonna see this and flip his lid.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.892
Hey, slim! You got my uni ready?

38:32.769 --> 38:34.896
There's been a bit of a problem, boss.

38:35.480 --> 38:39.275
- What the hell is this?
- I left the iron on it too long.

38:39.901 --> 38:43.404
You are as stupid as you are fat,
do you know that, D-cups?

38:43.738 --> 38:46.115
My new shirt's coming out of your kick.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.247
- You're gonna tell me right now.
- Tell you what?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.917
What the hell you got going on
that's got you burning up guard suits?

38:57.001 --> 38:59.504
Trust me, <i>primo.</i>
The less you know, the better.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.759
(DOOR BUZZING)

39:11.558 --> 39:12.809
Any news?

39:13.768 --> 39:18.064
No. No, not yet.
Testing takes a couple of days.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.776
What do you remember of Dad?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.445
Your dad? I didn't know him.

39:25.572 --> 39:29.284
Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff
about him when we were growing up.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.203
I think I saw him when I was in the chair.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.664
Lincoln.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.792
It was him. I know it was.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.255
How would you know?
You haven't seen his face in 30 years.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.341
- The name that was used, Willie Prall.
- So?

39:45.425 --> 39:48.136
It's the name of this guy
who threw for Chicago back in the day.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.764
Dad and me were really into him
but I'd forgotten all about him.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.850
It's really weird.

39:55.476 --> 39:59.230
Been having these dreams, memories,
things I guess I suppressed when he left.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.440
But...

40:01.941 --> 40:05.987
This man who came to the execution,
how do you know he used that name?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.488
Pope told me.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.991
Was that before
or after you had the dream?

40:12.535 --> 40:15.079
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

40:15.747 --> 40:18.499
I don't mean to challenge
what you're saying,

40:18.583 --> 40:21.628
but your dad's been MIA
almost your entire life.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.421
I know what I saw, V.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.966
I know what I saw.

40:28.635 --> 40:29.636
(SIGHING)

40:34.641 --> 40:37.226
This is the security camera footage
of the courthouse

40:37.352 --> 40:39.520
from the night that Judge Kessler
got those documents.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.189
Now, check out this guy.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.692
He is very skilled.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.862
He moves casually enough
to avoid suspicion.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.908
You see how he shifts his hat
when he turns corners to hide his face?

40:52.408 --> 40:54.869
He knows exactly
where those cameras are.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.666
Wait. Right there.

40:59.749 --> 41:02.210
See that reflection? Rewind it. Rewind it.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.965
Right. Can you blow that up?

41:18.059 --> 41:20.103
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

41:22.105 --> 41:23.523
I know that guy.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.988
What is it?

41:30.405 --> 41:32.532
It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.784
I removed it
during the débridement procedure.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.285
And what about it?

41:36.577 --> 41:39.747
Well, this fabric doesn't come
from a standard issue prison uniform.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.793
- Where'd it come from then?
- As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.714

(MEN CHATTERING)

41:56.931 --> 41:58.391
Open on 40!

41:58.474 --> 42:00.018
GUARD: 40 open!

42:02.603 --> 42:03.938
Close 40!

42:04.272 --> 42:05.606
40 closed!

42:07.567 --> 42:09.068
How you feeling?

42:37.346 --> 42:38.723
What's wrong?

42:39.932 --> 42:41.309
The blueprints,

42:42.268 --> 42:45.646
the ones we need to get
from the psych ward to the infirmary,

42:46.481 --> 42:48.107
our map out of here,

42:50.193 --> 42:51.778
they're gone.
