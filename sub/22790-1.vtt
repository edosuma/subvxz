00:36.467 --> 00:37.933
(Radio Voice) - This is Chipisin

00:37.967 --> 00:39.033
with WTRA Radio.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.767
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled broadcast of

00:41.800 --> 00:43.933
Symphony Sid to bring you
this special news buletin.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.533
The local economy is being
strangled
by Kazah Kingcapa (distorted)

00:46.567 --> 00:47.833
and his evil goons.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.300
Heir (distorted) has taken
control

00:50.333 --> 00:53.167
of our shipping mains and
crippled our means of survival.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.100
Their reign of tyranny
must come to an end

00:55.133 --> 00:57.433
This has been a public service
announcement brought you

00:57.467 --> 00:58.467
by WTRA radio.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.067
We now return you to

01:00.067 --> 01:02.233
Symphony Sid already in
progress.

(beeps)

01:04.266 --> 01:05.266
(radio tunes)

01:18.367 --> 01:19.367
Heir Comendon!

01:19.667 --> 01:21.200
We just seized another

01:21.433 --> 01:23.067
whiskey shipment from

01:23.067 --> 01:24.267
the East Siders.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.067
Excellent work Sargent.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.533
It is imperative that the

01:27.567 --> 01:29.433
surrounding units stay vigilant.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.600
They may deploy a counter
attack.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.200
Ya vill, heir Commendon!

01:33.500 --> 01:35.167
We have secured a perimeter

01:35.200 --> 01:36.300
around the camp.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.133
Ammunition supplies have

01:38.167 --> 01:40.167
just arrived with an extra

01:40.200 --> 01:42.267
battalion of infantry soldiers.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.067
Our main objective is to

01:44.067 --> 01:46.600
secure this island and control
the

01:46.633 --> 01:47.967
water surrounding it.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.333
If we see another one of those

01:49.367 --> 01:50.967
whiskey shipments, I want to

01:51.067 --> 01:52.367
attack swift and hard.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.800
Eliminate the crew and

01:53.833 --> 01:55.500
and confiscate their materials.

01:55.533 --> 01:56.533
Yes, sir!

01:57.067 --> 01:58.633
We will move our location

01:58.667 --> 02:01.067
to a tower on the South
peninsula.

02:01.233 --> 02:03.400
I will personally monitor the

02:03.433 --> 02:04.900
situation from there.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.067
I have received intelligence
that

02:07.067 --> 02:09.167
they may use the southern
corridor to

02:09.199 --> 02:10.866
send another shipment through.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.367
Ya vill, heri Commendon!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.933
One last thing Sargent.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.900
Let's make sure we don't have

02:15.933 --> 02:18.167
another incident like last time
you

02:18.200 --> 02:19.700
were supposed to keep watch.

02:19.733 --> 02:20.833
For your sake.

02:20.867 --> 02:22.500
Ya vill, heir Commendon!

02:24.167 --> 02:25.200
(marching drums)

02:31.467 --> 02:33.067
(weak motorcycle engine)

02:40.067 --> 02:43.733
(voiceover) - Meanwhile, back
at Machine Gun Murray's Office.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.067
(radio beeps)

02:52.067 --> 02:53.067
(door knocking)

02:53.067 --> 02:54.067
Meh, come in.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.467
(door creaks open)
(footsteps)

02:56.700 --> 02:59.200
Boss, I just got a message
through the telegraph.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.900
The Krauts got us again.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.167
Son of a& Get the crew ready!

03:03.200 --> 03:05.733
Leave me and the captain here
to do a little chit chatting.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.500
Serve up a round of
drinks for the boys.

03:07.533 --> 03:11.300
We's gonna see what we gonna do
about this little problem here,

03:11.333 --> 03:14.367
see? These Krauts want a war?
Then they got a war, see?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.733
Be helpin' you, I be.

03:15.767 --> 03:17.233
That's beautifull, see?

03:17.500 --> 03:19.333
I spit out some false
info out on the streets.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.567
I let the word spread
that I was going to send

03:21.600 --> 03:23.833
my next shipment through the
southern corridor, see?

03:23.867 --> 03:26.367
I knew someone would spill the
beans to one of Klinks goons.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.967
That's where your ship comes in.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.567
We're gonna send you ship
through the Southern Corridor,
see?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.233
Because that's where they expect
it.

03:32.267 --> 03:34.067
We's gonna draw all the
attention down there.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.700
Then up the Northern Corridor
I'm gonna send a rickety row

03:36.733 --> 03:38.967
boat with a couple of barrels of
hooch for my next delivery, see?

03:39.067 --> 03:40.367
They won't suspect a thing.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.467
Them Krauts will have all their
guns
and their men on the South side.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.800
See? All you need to do is
to stay within firing range

03:44.833 --> 03:47.167
and have a cannon fight with
them to keep their attention.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.533
As soon as my ship makes passage
you'll get a message that

03:49.567 --> 03:50.967
you can turn your ship
back around to safety.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.367
That sounds like a good plan.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
Beautiful, see?

03:54.500 --> 03:57.067
I'm gonna give you Nicky the
Nose with his Tommy Gun.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.133
(dramatic music)

04:15.067 --> 04:16.533
Ya vill, heir Commendon!

04:16.567 --> 04:19.166
All of our gun enplacements
have been reinforced.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.333
Are you sure it is a
good idea to concentrate

04:22.367 --> 04:24.667
the bulk of our forces
at the South side?

04:24.700 --> 04:25.733
Don't be a fool.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.700
I have direct intelligence that
this
is where they will attack from.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.833
Make sure everyone
stays on high alert.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.500
Ya vill, heir Commendon!

04:38.200 --> 04:39.267
(motor engaging)

04:39.667 --> 04:41.533
Watch out for the sea monster.

04:41.567 --> 04:42.700
Meh!

04:42.733 --> 04:43.867
Navigation.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.867
Aye, captain!

04:44.900 --> 04:46.600
Be 15 miles from our
destination, we be.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.433
(bird) - Quack quizzle!
(fart)

04:48.467 --> 04:51.100
Sorry! 16 miles from
our destination.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.533
Maintain this course.

04:52.567 --> 04:55.233
Shiver me timbers,
this might just work.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.067
I have spotted something
out of my port side.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.067
This is the shipment I received
the intelligence about.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.867
We must destroy this ship!

05:06.900 --> 05:10.667
Requesting permission to adjust
firing course of cannon.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.100
Permission granted!

05:12.133 --> 05:16.300
Sargent, alert the rest of those
other
ships we have spotted the enemy.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.633
We've got them. It's time.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.700
Ya vill, heir Commendon!

05:18.733 --> 05:19.900
They have spotted us.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.067
Fire all cannon!

05:22.067 --> 05:23.067
(cannons fire)

05:26.167 --> 05:27.400
(machine gun fires)

05:33.933 --> 05:34.933
(explosions)

05:50.867 --> 05:51.867
(beeps)

05:52.300 --> 05:55.400
They made it. Be turnin'
this here ship around.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.133
Pete! No!

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
Meh!

06:04.567 --> 06:08.833
Scoop him up. Looks like we have
a little prisoner on our hands.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.100
(laughs) Excellent!

06:10.700 --> 06:12.333
We need to go back for Pete.

06:12.367 --> 06:15.167
We's gonna sink if we
stick around here.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.300
God damnit, Pete!

06:18.233 --> 06:19.433
(triumphant music)

06:24.767 --> 06:27.200
(motorcycle engine) (marching
drums)

06:41.567 --> 06:42.567
(owl hoots)

06:49.233 --> 06:50.700
Excellent work, Gentleman.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.800
We have the prisoner
in our possession.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.767
They won't stop us this time.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.267
Ar, matey. You may have
gotten your whiskey through

07:02.300 --> 07:04.733
but I lost a crew
member back there.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.067
Ya, see, we're gonna get him
back.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.667
I've got this plan
I've got, see?

07:08.700 --> 07:11.167
I've got this connection back
in the Columbian Cartel.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.867
I can get them to hook
us up with some heat.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.267
We're gonna need better
guns for this gig, see?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.600
They hang out at Club Adelphi.

07:16.633 --> 07:19.467
Argh! Well, be payin'
them a visit, we be.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.300
(orchestra music)

07:45.200 --> 07:47.100
Hey, red ball, corner pocket.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.767
(pool stick) (pool ball bounces)

10:14.333 --> 10:16.667
And that, dear students,
is the last time

10:16.700 --> 10:19.333
Hollywood couple,
Gayle Evelyn and Peter Sherwood

10:19.367 --> 10:20.933
ever appeared in front
of a camera.

10:20.967 --> 10:23.700
Wow. For a silent movie,
that was such a turn on.

10:23.733 --> 10:27.100
I didn't even know sex
existed back then.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.433
Well, Miss Collins,

10:28.467 --> 10:29.767
I think you should check
your family tree.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.633
I think you'll find it's been
around even longer than that.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.933
Monument Pictures
must have been devastated.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.533
I mean, losing two
of their biggest stars.

10:37.567 --> 10:38.700
One right after another.

10:38.733 --> 10:40.967
It is a true Tinseltown

10:41.000 --> 10:41.933
love tragedy to be sure.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.333
I mean,
here's Peter Sherwood

10:43.367 --> 10:44.967
and he rises to fame
in the 1930s

10:45.000 --> 10:48.600
in famous costume dramas like
"Kitty hawk" and "Bull Run."

10:48.633 --> 10:52.300
And then is cast along side
the feisty Gayle Evelyn.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.000
The gossip columnists
ate it up.

10:54.033 --> 10:56.600
Called it
the "Monumental Affair."

10:56.633 --> 10:57.633
That's so romantic.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.567
I'm such a sucker
for Hollywood love stories.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.700
Well, unfortunately,
Tabitha,

11:01.733 --> 11:06.400
this one has an unhappy
and mysterious ending.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.067
How so, Professor?

11:09.100 --> 11:11.700
So just days after
that home movie was shot,

11:11.733 --> 11:13.967
The Private Sherwood was
sent to the Pacific Theater.

11:14.067 --> 11:17.700
Unfortunately, his transport
plane was presumed shot down

11:17.733 --> 11:19.700
over water
and never recovered.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.667
My God.
How awful for her.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.467
She must have been
heartbroken.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.967
More than that,
she went into hiding.

11:25.067 --> 11:28.333
She fired all her help
and she became a total recluse.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.067
She locked herself up
in the mansion

11:30.067 --> 11:32.100
that she and Sherwood
had bought each other.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.833
But what happened to her?

11:33.867 --> 11:34.800
Well, Miss Connors,

11:34.833 --> 11:36.300
had you read Griffith's
"Haunted Hollywood"

11:36.333 --> 11:39.433
as I asked you to last week,
you'd
know the answer to that
question.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.700
I read it. I just must
have skipped that chapter.

11:41.733 --> 11:44.667
I see. All right. Well, I
probably
should refresh everyone anyway

11:44.700 --> 11:48.933
as we're going to be spending
the
night in her mansion tomorrow.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.333
What? But I thought
that was unobtainable.

11:51.367 --> 11:55.300
Mike, when you and the others
signed
up for advanced psychokinesis,

11:55.333 --> 11:57.633
it was the study ESP,
spiritualism,

11:57.667 --> 11:59.767
and, most certainly,
ghostly phenomenon.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.233
- So?
- So despite the fact that this
university

12:03.267 --> 12:04.967
is run by
antiquated ghouls,

12:05.067 --> 12:06.367
you're probably not
very likely

12:06.400 --> 12:08.733
to run into any ghosts
here on campus.

12:08.767 --> 12:09.867
Then we're in.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.133
Yes, I did work some magic

12:11.167 --> 12:13.333
and so, we have access
as of tomorrow.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.700
But wait.
What happened to her?

12:15.733 --> 12:17.567
Well, that's just it.
Nobody knows.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.500
When the relatives finally
broke down the doors,

12:19.533 --> 12:22.633
all they found were cobwebs,
some unopened mail,

12:22.667 --> 12:25.833
and this handwritten note
by her.

12:25.867 --> 12:28.367
Which said?

12:33.067 --> 12:35.667
This is just a copy,
you understand?

12:35.700 --> 12:37.633
All:
What's it say?

12:37.667 --> 12:40.100
"My dearest Peter,
I will never let anyone

12:40.133 --> 12:43.467
break the sanctity
of our honeymoon home.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.467
I await your return.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.833
Love forever, Gayle."

12:46.867 --> 12:49.767
- Oh. That's so sad.
- Makes me want to cry.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.067
According to the relatives, the
only
crying was for help once night
fell

12:54.067 --> 12:57.333
and the evil spirit of
Gayle Evelyn manifested.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.267
Wait, wait.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.233
You mean this house
is haunted for real?

13:00.267 --> 13:02.067
By a missing-in-action
movie star no less.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.800
The house has been on the
market for more than 60 years

13:04.833 --> 13:06.067
and no one's been able
to spend

13:06.100 --> 13:08.700
one or two nights here
without running in terror.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.133
And this is where we're spending
the weekend, you say?

13:11.167 --> 13:13.967
I expect everyone to be
in the quad parking lot

13:14.067 --> 13:15.067
at 2:00 p.m. sharp.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.667
Bring food and your own
pillow if you want

13:17.700 --> 13:20.833
and anything else you think
you might need to survive.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.500
You mean like a crucifix
and holy water?

13:23.533 --> 13:24.967
Couldn't hurt.

13:25.067 --> 13:28.167
Always better to be safe
than sorry.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.067
( music playing )

15:16.500 --> 15:18.867
( door creaking )

15:29.400 --> 15:32.967
Man:We've got them this
time...

15:33.067 --> 15:34.500
They have spotted us.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.867
Fire all cannons.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.433
What are you doing
in there?

15:45.467 --> 15:46.500
The animation station

15:46.533 --> 15:49.333
did their own version
of "Pirates of Penzance."

15:49.367 --> 15:51.067
Yeah, that sounds good.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.333
You should be packing.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.933
As a matter of fact,
it is good.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.700
I'll pack later.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.400
Hey. I was really into that.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.600
Aren't you the least bit
apprehensive

16:06.633 --> 16:09.500
about spending the night
tomorrow in a haunted house?

16:09.533 --> 16:12.767
- To put it bluntly, no.
- And why not?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.833
Candi, you and I have been
in Professor Rand's

16:15.867 --> 16:17.867
supernatural class
all semester.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.133
- True?
- Yeah. True.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.500
Well, in all that time,

16:21.533 --> 16:24.367
can you name one moment,
any moment,

16:24.400 --> 16:27.200
where even the remotest
supernatural event occurred?

16:27.233 --> 16:29.833
Well, there was that one
palm reader.

16:29.867 --> 16:33.067
He knew I put in an application
to "Sexting with the Stars."

16:33.100 --> 16:36.200
Forgive me, honey, but every one
on your Flutter account did
also.

16:36.233 --> 16:39.500
That wasn't exactly a
national secret by any means.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.067
So you're saying
you don't believe?

16:41.100 --> 16:44.667
I'm saying I'm from Jersey.
Now that's the Show Me state.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.233
Let me see with my own eyes
and you got me.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.800
Hmm.
Show me, huh?

16:49.833 --> 16:51.700
That's it.
If I can eyeball it,

16:51.733 --> 16:54.100
touch it, feel it,
you've won me over.

16:54.833 --> 16:58.200
All right, Mr. Skeptic.

17:24.833 --> 17:28.099
So you ready to touch it?

17:28.099 --> 17:29.300
Feel it?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.167
And I thought
the pirate cartoon was good.

17:40.133 --> 17:44.300
Aw. I see
you have reservations.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.067
As a matter of fact, we do.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.467
Tomorrow night
at a haunted house.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.133
Not those type of reservations,
silly, silly boy.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.500
Your woman here
has second thoughts

17:53.533 --> 17:55.967
about traveling to a place
that is inhabited

17:56.067 --> 18:00.067
by such a troubled
and restless spirit.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.833
You mean Gayle Evelyn?

18:01.867 --> 18:03.233
Yes.
Her burdened soul

18:03.267 --> 18:06.567
is trapped there in that
dank dwelling you speak of.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.167
Awaiting a release
that may never come.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.133
How can you tell all that?

18:12.167 --> 18:13.633
I was born with a gift.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.067
I'd say a couple.

18:15.067 --> 18:17.533
So why is she here?

18:17.567 --> 18:19.533
After death, most spirits

18:19.567 --> 18:21.167
rise up to a greater reward.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.833
However, there are those
unfortunate souls

18:24.867 --> 18:27.400
that are forever bound
to this Earth

18:27.433 --> 18:31.067
by, let's say,
unfinished business.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.867
Really? Like, waiting
for a lost love.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
Exactly.

18:36.333 --> 18:39.533
Her lover may have moved on
to a greater plane,

18:39.567 --> 18:41.533
but her vow to wait for him

18:41.567 --> 18:44.167
may anchor her
to this mortal coil

18:44.200 --> 18:45.700
for all eternity.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.633
Oh, my gosh.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.200
Maybe we could
actually help her?

18:49.233 --> 18:50.767
- How?
-I don't know.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.500
But if she appears to us,
maybe we can explain?

18:53.533 --> 18:56.067
I don't know about you, doll,
but if she appears to me,

18:56.067 --> 18:59.067
don't go grabbing for the
trousers
flying out the front door.

18:59.067 --> 19:00.833
- Why?
- 'Cause I'll be in 'em.

19:00.867 --> 19:04.067
Mike, stop it.
Be serious.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.067
I am being serious.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.300
Any horny ghost shows up,
I'm gone.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.533
Yeah, you say that now.

19:09.567 --> 19:10.800
Wait.

19:10.833 --> 19:11.900
Listen very carefully.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.567
If you do perhaps
make contact with her,

19:14.600 --> 19:19.700
you must first be anointed with
the
love wrath for your protection.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.067
The "love wrath"?

19:21.067 --> 19:22.300
What the hell is that?

19:22.333 --> 19:23.967
It is a counter spirit

19:24.067 --> 19:27.833
that will protect you
from all forms of harm.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.733
Great.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.967
And how much is that
gonna cost me?

19:31.067 --> 19:33.500
- Mike!
- What? I'm just asking.

19:33.533 --> 19:36.800
For such beautiful people
as yourselves,

19:36.833 --> 19:39.367
it will be free of charge.

19:39.400 --> 19:43.167
Now that's the type of price
that I'm talking about.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.133
How do we get started?

19:44.167 --> 19:47.767
Simple. Just kiss
your friend over here.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.900
- Just kiss her?
- Yes.

19:48.933 --> 19:52.767
You know, I think I'm
starting to change my opinion

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
about mind readers, madam.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.467
So... is that it?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.933
Now you must pass
the love forward.

20:07.967 --> 20:11.533
- You mean kiss him back?
-No, dear.

20:11.567 --> 20:15.067
The love must
pass through me first.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.967
- Really?
- Really.

20:25.967 --> 20:28.433
You do realize we're only
going away for a night,

20:28.467 --> 20:29.933
not an entire month.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.333
Hey, you always want
to be well-prepared.

20:32.367 --> 20:35.267
You'll be thanking me later.
Trust me, babe.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.100
Okay, Mr. Scoutmaster.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.400
( sighs )
It's already five after.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.600
Why are we hanging around?

20:41.633 --> 20:43.100
Yeah, everything seems
ready to go.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.567
We're waiting for
a surprise guest.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.967
- Who's that?
- Let's just say she'll play

20:47.000 --> 20:50.067
a key role in
our paranormal adventure.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.833
"She"? Who's she?

20:58.067 --> 21:01.067
Professor! Professor!

21:01.500 --> 21:05.833
- Will you look at that.
- Get a load of that chassis.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.267
Yeah, and the girls
not bad either.

21:09.300 --> 21:13.067
- She looks familiar, too. -
Hey, she
better not look too familiar,
buster.

21:13.067 --> 21:17.500
She should look familiar to
everyone. She's
the great granddaughter of Dawn
Cummings.

21:17.533 --> 21:19.833
Oh, man. That's that chick
from the film yesterday.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.600
She's the one
that was filming.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.533
And she's a dead ringer
for her, too.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.933
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
you to meet Samantha Hazel.

21:27.967 --> 21:30.833
Samantha is our special guest
for the weekend.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.100
Samantha this is--

21:32.133 --> 21:34.267
Tabatha, Mike,
Zane, and Candi.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.067
I feel like I know
you guys already,

21:36.100 --> 21:37.467
thanks to the Professor here.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.600
It's nice to meet you guys.

21:38.633 --> 21:40.233
- Likewise.
- I'll say.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.767
Samantha is the great
granddaughter

21:41.800 --> 21:44.400
of the once famous
movie actress Dawn Cummings.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.067
Dawn was Gayle Evelyn's
best friend.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.433
Pardon me for saying,
but you're a dead ringer

21:48.467 --> 21:50.767
- for that girl in the film.
- Thank you.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.500
She was beautiful, I know.

21:52.533 --> 21:54.067
After Gayle disappeared,
in her will,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.100
she left all her possessions
and the house to Dawn Cummings.

21:57.133 --> 21:58.733
My family's owned the house
ever since

21:58.767 --> 22:01.600
and the curse that goes along
with it, unfortunately.

22:01.633 --> 22:05.100
I've been emailing Samantha back
and forth for quite some time.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.967
She's been very helpful
in my studies.

22:07.067 --> 22:09.333
The legend surrounding
the spirit of Gayle Evelyn

22:09.367 --> 22:11.800
was something my family
never wanted to talk about.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.167
- So why now?
- I've been writing letters

22:14.200 --> 22:15.700
to Gayle's mother
for quite some time,

22:15.733 --> 22:17.767
but she never wanted
to have anything to do

22:17.800 --> 22:19.067
with my paranormal studies.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.767
Fortunately,
Samantha has come of age

22:20.800 --> 22:22.300
and has a different
frame of mind.

22:22.333 --> 22:25.133
But how do we
fit into all of this?

22:25.167 --> 22:27.500
Simple. We're gonna see
if we can't reach across

22:27.533 --> 22:30.933
into the spirit world
and find Gayle Evelyn.

22:30.967 --> 22:31.933
Yeah, simple.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.400
Well, if we can somehow
release Gayle's soul,

22:34.433 --> 22:37.800
the house can go clean,
and she can rest in peace.

22:37.833 --> 22:39.400
Jeez, the plot thickens, huh?

22:39.433 --> 22:42.500
Can you show some respect
sometimes, would you?

22:42.533 --> 22:43.667
Sorry. No offense meant.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.333
Well, enough of this standing
around yapping.

22:45.367 --> 22:47.233
Let's get this
show on the road.

22:47.267 --> 22:49.133
Excellent idea, Mike.

23:23.333 --> 23:26.300
- Wow.
- This is quite a place.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.267
Even more majestic
than I expected.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.700
- Spectacular.
- I'll say.

23:29.733 --> 23:34.200
If I was a ghost, this is
where I'd come a haunting.

23:49.767 --> 23:52.333
Damn. It really is
creeped out in here.

23:52.367 --> 23:55.333
Not movie creepy,
real creepy.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.467
I know.
I mean, it feels like,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.300
I don't know, we're being
watched or something.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.700
Candi, don't say stuff like
that.
I'm already scared.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.533
Not much like the classroom,
is it, guys?

24:04.567 --> 24:05.600
No, not at all.

24:05.633 --> 24:08.267
Follow me upstairs,
I'll show you to your room.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.767
Upstairs?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.600
Yeah. That's where
the bedrooms are.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.167
Zane: And the
bathrooms, too, I hope.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.533
You'll have your choice
of three lavish commodes.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.600
Great 'cause I could
really use a shower.

24:17.633 --> 24:19.100
( sighs ) Zane,

24:19.133 --> 24:21.800
why are you thinking about
taking
a shower in a place like this?

24:21.833 --> 24:23.467
Because I was cooped up
all day in that van.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.067
- You had air conditioning.
- Not where I was sitting.

24:26.067 --> 24:28.300
Candi, just let him
take a shower.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.500
I'll keep you protected, okay?

24:29.533 --> 24:31.133
Come on, pal. Let's go out
and grab the bags.

24:31.167 --> 24:34.700
That's right, guys. Let's get
settled
because I want everybody down
here

24:34.733 --> 24:37.133
at 7:00 sharp
for the séance.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.500
You didn't say anything
about a séance.

24:38.533 --> 24:41.433
Well, how were you expecting to
contact the dead, Miss Crane?

24:41.467 --> 24:46.367
- Facebook? - There's a bunch
of dead people on Facebook.

24:47.433 --> 24:50.067
All right, Miss Hazel,
if you will.

24:50.067 --> 24:51.933
Right this way, ladies.

24:51.967 --> 24:54.367
7:00 p.m. sharp.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.667
( water running )

25:06.700 --> 25:09.533
Now don't hog
all the hot water.

25:09.567 --> 25:10.967
If there is any.

25:11.067 --> 25:15.600
I've been standing here for 10
minutes
and the thing is still ice cold.

25:15.633 --> 25:16.800
Don't sweat it, ladies.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.633
I just went down to the cellar
and turned on the heater.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.667
Both:
You went down there alone?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.867
Yes, I did.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.367
And I'm sorry to report,
no ghost sightings yet.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.167
Know what? It can stay like
that till morning.

25:27.200 --> 25:31.933
What? I thought you were girls
were
all about all things paranormal.

25:31.967 --> 25:34.067
Not me.
My boyfriend.

25:34.067 --> 25:37.367
He actually did tell me
that there were no ghosts

25:37.400 --> 25:39.833
and that this
was an easy pass.

25:39.867 --> 25:42.133
So here I am
just enjoying the ride.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.067
Well, at least you're honest.
What about you, Tabatha?

25:45.067 --> 25:46.767
Well, I'm doing this
for my dad.

25:46.800 --> 25:50.567
He was a magician in Vegas
for years until he retired.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.133
As a little girl,
I remember him saying

25:53.167 --> 25:54.967
that magic as more
than just an illusion.

25:55.067 --> 25:58.300
That it was a gateway
to places unknown.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.067
After he passed on
last spring,

26:00.100 --> 26:02.633
I decided to do some
investigating on my own.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.367
Just to see if it was true.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.600
Aw. I never knew that, Tabby.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.567
- Are they in there?
- I believe so.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.367
Do you think
they'll make contact?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.500
From what that couple
told me last night,

26:17.533 --> 26:19.467
they've got
a really good chance.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.500
Professor Rands
had amazing success

26:21.533 --> 26:22.867
with supernatural
communication.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.667
Okay, but what good
does that do either of us

26:24.700 --> 26:28.100
if we're stuck out here
when he makes contact?

26:28.133 --> 26:29.500
Do you think it was
just a coincidence

26:29.533 --> 26:32.267
that couple came to my shop last
night to have their palm's read?

26:32.300 --> 26:35.667
- I'm not sure.
- Well, I'm telling you, it
wasn't.

26:35.700 --> 26:38.467
It was a sign
from Gayle Evelyn herself.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.200
She knows who I really am
and she wants me to be here.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.900
I'm sure of it.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.300
Zane:Sure of what, ladies?

26:45.333 --> 26:46.867
Can I help you?

26:46.900 --> 26:48.467
Yes. I'm Sandy Smith.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.067
This is my friend
Blanch Thompson.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.333
Your neighbors
on either side.

26:51.367 --> 26:53.100
We heard some noise
over here this afternoon

26:53.133 --> 26:55.833
and we were sure
some new folks had moved in.

26:55.867 --> 26:57.300
Ah, the welcome wagon.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.600
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

26:58.633 --> 27:00.367
But instead of ringing
the front doorbell

27:00.400 --> 27:02.067
and introducing yourselves,
you thought it best

27:02.067 --> 27:05.700
to sneak in the backyard with
some
binoculars and check things out
first.

27:05.733 --> 27:08.700
Yeah, that's it.
Totally innocent.

27:08.733 --> 27:10.300
I'm sure it is.

27:10.333 --> 27:13.067
- Look, Mr...
- Call me, Zane.

27:13.067 --> 27:15.533
Zane, I know, you know,

27:15.567 --> 27:16.600
we're here trespassing.

27:16.633 --> 27:18.367
But I can assure you
there's a very good reason.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.067
- Which is? - Well, I met two of
your very good friends last
night

27:22.067 --> 27:25.267
when they came into my shop
to have their fortunes told.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.467
Hmm. I heard about that

27:27.500 --> 27:28.800
on the drive over
this afternoon.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.700
Sounds like everyone
had a hell of a time.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.433
Well, when they told me
about your plan

27:32.467 --> 27:34.967
to contact Gayle Evelyn,
I just had to be here.

27:35.067 --> 27:36.800
- Why's that?
- Personal reasons.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.467
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that,

27:38.500 --> 27:42.633
- Madam Zolta, is it?
- Yes, that is my professional
name.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.467
And this is my colleague
Salina Protruska.

27:44.500 --> 27:48.533
She's another psychic who
occasionally
fills in for me on weekends.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.267
So you're the moral support.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.767
So what do you say, Zane?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.833
Could you accommodate
two extra party crashers

27:53.867 --> 27:57.100
- at your little séance tonight?
- I'm not really sure.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.233
Well, I'm sure
the two of us

27:59.267 --> 28:01.833
could make it
worth your while.

28:01.867 --> 28:03.733
You mean...

28:03.767 --> 28:06.067
Would you like
your palm read?

28:06.067 --> 28:07.067
Sure.

28:07.067 --> 28:11.267
Salina, let's take care
of that.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.533
You know, I think I can
predict my own future.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.967
Hey, girl. Don't take too long.
We got the séance coming up.

28:34.067 --> 28:36.067
Just gonna be a minute.

28:36.067 --> 28:39.133
Gotta look good
for the ghosts.

28:44.467 --> 28:45.967
( footsteps )

28:46.067 --> 28:48.200
Tabatha?

28:49.300 --> 28:52.667
Tabby?
Is that you?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.200
Hmm.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.433
( door creaking )

29:58.167 --> 30:00.233
Looking for something?

30:00.233 --> 30:04.000
Oh, hey, Cand.
I could have swore that I
packed my favorite blue-- whoa!

30:04.000 --> 30:07.033
Hey. Sorry, Cand.

30:07.033 --> 30:10.133
You can look if you want.
So you like my new lingerie?

30:10.133 --> 30:13.833
Yeah. They're amazing.
I mean, it's amazing.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.500
I just thought
it would be something fun
to bring on the trip.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.367
Fun for the whole family.

30:18.367 --> 30:20.733
Well, if you like
what it looks like on me...

30:20.733 --> 30:24.733
what about what it looks like
on the floor?

30:34.933 --> 30:37.067
( chatter )

30:41.233 --> 30:44.867
So what do you think
of those two, Professor?

30:44.900 --> 30:46.967
They seem innocent enough.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.633
Well, to be honest with you,

30:48.667 --> 30:50.267
I'm not thrilled
with either one of them.

30:50.300 --> 30:53.433
Well, I can understand that,
but I think their unexpected

30:53.467 --> 30:55.933
arrival here
may be for the good.

30:55.967 --> 30:57.100
Okay.

30:57.133 --> 30:59.200
It's just that this haunting
has been in my family

30:59.233 --> 31:02.767
for so long, I'm hesitant
to let anyone new in.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.067
I get your point.
But, you know, they might

31:05.100 --> 31:07.667
offer a spiritual guidance
during the séance.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.767
Yeah, that's what
I was kinda afraid of.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.400
Well, I don't
want you to worry

31:13.433 --> 31:16.967
because I have this.

31:18.933 --> 31:20.400
What's that?

31:20.433 --> 31:23.733
That is a
3,000-year-old amulet

31:23.767 --> 31:25.167
meant to worship Osiris.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.067
3,000 years old and you
keep it in your pocket

31:28.067 --> 31:29.567
with your car keys
and your change?

31:29.600 --> 31:32.233
It's pretty cool, though.
What do you use it for?

31:32.267 --> 31:35.500
Well, some say you can
use it to contact the dead.

31:35.533 --> 31:40.200
So it's kinda like an ancient
cellphone to the dead.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.900
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.167
Well, jeez.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.067
Where do you pick up a little
trinket like this, Doc?

31:45.067 --> 31:49.233
I mean, I'm sure they don't give
it
away with every camel ride you
take.

31:49.267 --> 31:52.667
As a matter of fact,
I bought it off an old fakir.

31:52.700 --> 31:57.200
- An old fucker?
- Fakir. Fakir.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.633
Oh, my God.

32:01.233 --> 32:02.433
( screaming )

32:02.467 --> 32:05.233
- What the hell was that?!
- An earthquake, I hope.

32:05.267 --> 32:06.700
No quake ever sounded
like that.

32:06.733 --> 32:08.167
It sounds like
it came from upstairs.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.667
- Mike, Zane, come with me.
- To the van?

32:09.700 --> 32:12.067
- No, upstairs.
- You think that's a good idea,
Doc?

32:12.067 --> 32:15.333
Mr. Crawford, you've been
scoffing
at the spirit world all
semester,

32:15.367 --> 32:18.533
now's your chance to prove
me wrong once and for all.

32:18.567 --> 32:19.900
Okay, okay.

32:19.933 --> 32:21.100
What the hell is that?

32:21.133 --> 32:24.167
Holy water. You never know.
It's good to have a back up.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.067
Right.

32:26.567 --> 32:29.400
All right, you ladies wait here.
And remember, stay together.

32:29.433 --> 32:30.667
Do not worry.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.067
I will keep
you all safe from evil.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.233
Oh, great. Now I feel
totally secure.

32:35.267 --> 32:39.700
Do not discount the powers
of the great Madame Zolta.

32:39.733 --> 32:42.433
Oh, far be it from me.

32:47.067 --> 32:48.633
- Who goes first?
- Well, Zane,

32:48.667 --> 32:50.500
it sounds like you're
actually becoming a believer.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.067
In some odd way, I think I've
probably done my job as a
teacher.

32:53.067 --> 32:56.567
Doc, I can tell you right now,
by
dawn, I'll be an out and out
convert.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.500
Follow me. Let's see
if this manifestation

32:59.533 --> 33:01.067
doesn't lead us
to Gayle Evelyn.

33:01.067 --> 33:03.533
Um, I may have already
been there, done that.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.767
- How do you mean?
- Well, earlier this afternoon,

33:05.800 --> 33:08.500
I may have had a close encounter
with the spirit world.

33:08.533 --> 33:10.233
You mean you felt
her presence?

33:10.267 --> 33:12.767
That's not all I felt.

33:14.200 --> 33:18.267
I don't hear them. Do you
think they found anything?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.267
Oh, God. I hope not
for their sake.

33:20.300 --> 33:24.267
I know one thing, Gayle Evelyn
still lives in this house

33:24.300 --> 33:25.667
as she has
for the past 70 years.

33:25.700 --> 33:29.067
And she would not be thrilled
with uninvited guests.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.367
- Like us?
- Definitely like us.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.067
Wait. Quiet, everyone.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.900
Salina. Salina,
do you hear that?

33:35.933 --> 33:37.067
Yes. Yes, I do.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.633
Faint,
but growing stronger.

33:39.667 --> 33:40.833
What? What's faint?

33:40.867 --> 33:43.400
More to the point,
what's growing stronger?

33:43.433 --> 33:46.400
Another spirit
approaches this house

33:46.433 --> 33:47.633
from the nether regions.

33:47.667 --> 33:50.333
- Who?
- That is not yet clear.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.400
But we must prepare

33:52.433 --> 33:54.067
for an ectoplasmic
explosion.

33:54.067 --> 33:55.867
Should I get a tarp
or something?

33:55.900 --> 33:59.733
- Is the spirit evil?
- No. Not evil.

33:59.767 --> 34:01.433
It is clean,

34:01.467 --> 34:05.933
but very, very powerful.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.433
All right, let's split up
and search the rooms.

34:08.467 --> 34:10.067
Split up?
That's the worst idea ever.

34:10.067 --> 34:12.400
I say we make it a group thing.
Come on, what do you think?

34:12.433 --> 34:15.266
I say you're scared shitless,
Mr. Crawford.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.867
No. Not in the least.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.199
Well, maybe a tiny bit.

34:18.233 --> 34:19.933
All right, you go down that
hall.
Check the master bedroom.

34:19.967 --> 34:23.500
You go down this way and check
the
bedrooms. I'll check the
bathrooms.

34:23.533 --> 34:26.300
- Right, Doc.
- Beautiful.

34:31.433 --> 34:32.867
Anything more yet?

34:32.900 --> 34:34.733
Yeah, who's the mystery ghost?

34:34.766 --> 34:37.699
We know now that the spirit
poses no threat.

34:37.733 --> 34:39.867
In fact,
he is filled

34:39.900 --> 34:43.067
with great,
positive energy.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.233
Love, if you will.

34:45.266 --> 34:46.699
- Peter.
- Peter?

34:46.733 --> 34:49.500
- Who's Peter?
- Peter Sherwood.

34:49.533 --> 34:51.867
Gayle's long lost lover.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.300
He's come to
reclaim his bride.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.167
Oh, how romantic.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.100
Man:How do you do,
ladies and gentlemen?

35:31.133 --> 35:32.433
This is Gregory McGurkin.

35:32.467 --> 35:35.733
Your host for another for
in the series of Evening
Chat.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.867
In entertainment news,
Monument Pictures

35:37.900 --> 35:40.067
released the name
of their newest picture
today.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.100
It stars Gayle Evelyn
and Peter Sherwood...

35:43.133 --> 35:46.200
Samantha.
What are you doing here?

35:46.233 --> 35:48.667
The Prof told you ladies
to stay downstairs.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.900
Samantha? I do not know
of this name.

35:51.933 --> 35:56.367
Are you all right?
You look a little pale.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.400
Actually,
you're beyond pale, girl.

35:59.433 --> 36:02.400
You're down right
transparent.

36:03.067 --> 36:04.633
Lady, let me outta here.

36:04.667 --> 36:06.067
I'm a believer, I swear.

36:06.067 --> 36:09.067
Nothing can interfere
with the covenant.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.233
Covenant?
What covenant?

36:11.267 --> 36:15.533
The two will finally be
together.
Reuniting.

36:15.567 --> 36:16.633
You mean Gayle
and her husband?

36:16.667 --> 36:18.567
That's what we came here
today to accomplish.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.100
She has longed for him
for so long.

36:21.133 --> 36:22.700
And now the two
will become one.

36:22.733 --> 36:25.600
Beautiful. I'm all for
romance, trust me, lady,

36:25.633 --> 36:27.833
but can you let me
outta here, please?

36:27.867 --> 36:30.600
And the medium
will be the conduit.

36:30.633 --> 36:32.767
She will bring them together.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.067
You mean Zolta?

36:34.067 --> 36:35.900
Can't be.
She's a quack.

36:35.933 --> 36:38.367
She will bound them together
and complete the circle.

36:38.400 --> 36:43.233
But how? She couldn't tell the
future
with a box of fortune cookies.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.433
Her ancestor was a Sherwood.

36:45.467 --> 36:48.533
Her inner light
is bringing him closer now.

36:48.567 --> 36:51.833
So that's why
she showed up unannounced.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.433
She cannot resist our call.

36:53.467 --> 36:54.633
To tell you
the honest truth,

36:54.667 --> 36:58.133
I'm finding you somewhat
hard to resist myself.

36:58.167 --> 37:00.067
I have not felt the passion

37:00.100 --> 37:01.900
of human flesh in so long.

37:01.933 --> 37:04.700
Well, is there any
possible way, you know...

37:04.733 --> 37:08.733
- You could join in?
- Never though I'd be say this,
but, yes.

37:08.767 --> 37:12.567
- Please, come.
- I hope to.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.633
Do I please you?

37:14.667 --> 37:19.800
Baby, you're the ghostest
with the mostest.

37:28.933 --> 37:31.100
Oh, hey.
Did you find anything?

37:31.133 --> 37:32.200
- You?
- Nothing.

37:32.233 --> 37:35.867
- Seen Zane?
- No, but-- oh, hey. There he
is.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.233
What's the matter with you,
buddy?
You look like you've seen a
ghost.

37:38.267 --> 37:40.167
I did and she had
quite a story to tell.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.333
You mean, you actually spoke
with Gayle Evelyn?

37:42.367 --> 37:44.100
No, but I got a mouthful
from her friend Dawn.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.933
It seems Madame Zolta downstairs
has a long lost relative

37:46.967 --> 37:49.733
of the soldier who got
shot down during the war.

37:49.767 --> 37:50.767
The spirits sent her here

37:50.800 --> 37:53.900
to guide this Sherwood fella
back to his girl.

37:53.933 --> 37:55.200
- That's it, then.
- What?

37:55.233 --> 37:57.400
- I'm a fool for not thinking
of this before.

37:57.433 --> 37:58.533
What's that?

37:58.567 --> 38:00.567
When Gayle Evelyn wrote
that note to her husband--

38:00.600 --> 38:03.800
You mean the one about not
leaving
the sanctity of her home?

38:03.833 --> 38:05.767
Yes.
She may have inadvertently

38:05.800 --> 38:08.200
cursed herself
to eternal imprisonment.

38:08.233 --> 38:10.267
Behind these dark walls.
My God.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.967
Only Sherwood's appearance
here can set her free.

38:13.067 --> 38:16.900
Well, then, I say we get this
séance going and make it happen.

38:16.933 --> 38:20.900
-( wind rushing )
- Tabatha!

38:23.467 --> 38:25.267
In here.

38:27.133 --> 38:29.500
My God.
It's happening.

38:32.733 --> 38:33.833
What? What's happening?

38:33.867 --> 38:38.200
Peter Sherwood's finally
coming home to claim his bride.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.733
Oh, my.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.233
Look, there.
It's Gayle.

38:50.267 --> 38:53.533
I'd recognize
that beauty anywhere.

38:55.267 --> 38:58.867
She's waiting for his arrival.
Just like us.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.667
He will be here shortly.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.433
Damn. He's gorgeous.

39:15.467 --> 39:18.067
They both are.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.067
Are they really gonna do it?

39:33.067 --> 39:35.433
Wouldn't you
after nearly a century?

39:35.467 --> 39:38.667
I feel like we're intruding.

39:46.233 --> 39:51.200
Come on, everybody. I think we
could all use a cup of coffee.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.900
Remember, honey.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.867
Magic is more
than just illusion.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.067
Daddy?

40:09.100 --> 40:12.933
Daddy, is that you?
What did you say?

40:12.967 --> 40:14.800
Believe in the magic,
sweet heart.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.367
Just believe.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.200
( music playing )

42:35.533 --> 43:02.367
Jazz music plays.

52:10.467 --> 52:26.233
Jazz music plays.

57:58.333 --> 58:19.533
Jazz music plays.

01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:26.267
Jazz music plays.

01:08:16.867 --> 01:08:38.332
Jazz music plays.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:14:20.267
Cheerful music

01:14:21.305 --> 01:14:27.470
