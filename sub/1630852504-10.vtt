WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.233
- What happened to your face?

00:01.368 --> 00:02.567
- I went out on a call,

00:02.603 --> 00:04.803
When I called for back-up...
- Nobody came.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.839
(misiano): You think you could
find me a couple of

00:06.974 --> 00:08.340
Trustworthy drivers?

00:08.475 --> 00:10.175
- I'm sure I've got some women
in my world

00:10.244 --> 00:11.110
That I trust.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.177
(sam): Here's our
working theory:

00:12.312 --> 00:14.413
Rick gets busted, tiggy
takes over from rick,

00:14.415 --> 00:16.614
Starts bringing in misiano's
cocaine across the border

00:16.650 --> 00:17.783
Using her logistics company.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.519
Starts working with randy bowen,
importing the cocaine

00:20.588 --> 00:21.953
And exporting the mdma.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.222
- How did we miss this?

00:23.224 --> 00:26.392
- I say we cut nelson out and
we take it all ourselves.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.261
I'm thinking I'm gonna go up
and see his warehouse soon.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.262
Check out and see how he makes
this stuff,

00:31.298 --> 00:32.598
And then, we pop him.

00:32.733 --> 00:33.598
(sam): Police, open up!

00:33.634 --> 00:35.100
We have a warrant for
your arrest!

00:35.102 --> 00:36.068
- Gotcha!
(screaming)

00:36.203 --> 00:37.336
(high-pitched yell)

00:37.338 --> 00:39.338
(jackie): You know, when my mom
does this mdma deal,

00:39.473 --> 00:41.073
She can get buffalo
off our back.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
- I think I gotta go to work
or they're gonna kill me.

00:43.277 --> 00:47.146
- One wrong move and you all
go down in flames.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.280
(karina): Tiggy sullivan's
cellphone just pinged

00:49.316 --> 00:50.782
About two miles south
of the fort derby border.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.351
(kelly): Police!
(sam): Stop that driver.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.019
(kelly): I'm gonna pick every
little piece of it apart

00:54.088 --> 00:55.287
Until I find her.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.955
(sam): Sol is gonna spend
the rest of his childhood

00:56.991 --> 00:58.289
Living with his grandmother.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.558
(tiggy): Cut me a decent deal,

00:59.560 --> 01:02.061
I'll hand over the man
who killed randy bowen.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.597
(kelly speaking indistinctly)

01:05.599 --> 01:08.633
- Okay, so I've briefed
detectives swallows and chase

01:08.669 --> 01:10.735
On the way over here,
they're up to speed.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.638
- Detective kelly duff,
drug squad.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.540
- Detective samantha wazowski,
guns and gangs.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.507
- Yes, we've met already.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.674
- Hm?
(sam): Uh?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.243
(chase and swallows): Yeah.
- I don't think so.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.445
- We did, remember,
blue hazmat suit?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.379
- Blue hazmat suit?
- Pop the hood and we went

01:21.381 --> 01:22.313
Underneath the--
(sam): I don't...

01:22.349 --> 01:24.850
- We're here to discuss
a joint operation,

01:24.919 --> 01:26.351
Shall we all take a seat?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.389
- Just gonna...
- Okay.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.325
- ...Squeeze in here.
- Make some space.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.526
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.594
(kelly): You got enough room
there?

01:35.729 --> 01:36.661
(chase): It's a joint operation.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.462
(swallows): Across mine too.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.465
Okay. Okay.
- Nice and comfy.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.334
- We hear you have a lead
on randy bowen's murder.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.502
- Oh, if by "lead" you mean

01:44.538 --> 01:46.538
A person in custody who
witnessed that murder,

01:46.540 --> 01:47.706
Then yeah.

01:48.843 --> 01:49.874
- This is big.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.543
(chase): It has to be handled
carefully.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.278
- We're happy to take it
from here.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.479
- Oh, no.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.681
This is our play.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.482
(sam): Look at you two cuties,

01:57.551 --> 01:59.485
Salivating like a couple
of pavlov's dogs,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.153
You are birka
and you are joy for ch--

02:01.222 --> 02:02.453
You know who ivan pavlov is,
right?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.421
- No idea.
(speaking indistinctly)

02:03.457 --> 02:04.957
- God, am I speaking into
the wind here?

02:05.092 --> 02:08.627
(kelly): Either way, we can have
you drooling all over our case.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.430
We have to persuade bill misiano
that we are his allies.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.032
We gotta be tough.
We gotta be convincing.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.333
(sam): It will take
your full support.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.835
From the sidelines.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.836
(kelly): We'll get misiano
for you.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.205
But it has to be our way.
<i> Capisce?</i>

02:20.274 --> 02:21.473
(swallows): Yeah, but--
- but?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.707
- No, excuse m--

02:22.776 --> 02:24.910
Yeah, but... Yeah, but, but...
- Yeah, but it should be us--

02:24.912 --> 02:26.178
Yeah, but it j--
- but.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.713
(kelly gibbering)
(swallows): But-- no, b--

02:27.848 --> 02:29.748
Wh-what are you, r2d2?
(kelly hums)

02:29.817 --> 02:30.782
(swallows): Stop this.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.783
(overlapping chatter)

02:31.919 --> 02:33.685
- But you say what?
(swallows stuttering)

02:37.458 --> 02:38.724
- Deal.
- Yeah!

02:38.859 --> 02:40.325
Deal.
(chuckling)

02:40.327 --> 02:41.527
Thank you!

02:42.930 --> 02:43.662
(kelly): Did I...

02:43.797 --> 02:45.530
We. Yeah, we.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.131
That wasn't so bad.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.867
- No, it wasn't.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.603
I peed my pants a little bit.
- Ugh.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.039
- What just happened?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.542
(♪ these boots were made
for walking ♪ plays)

03:20.634 --> 03:22.367
- Oh my god! Elliot!

03:22.436 --> 03:23.902
Hi!
- Hey.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.170
- What you doing here?

03:25.305 --> 03:28.306
- Nothing, I just, uh...
Missed you, that's all.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.041
(scoffing): Well, that's
a bold-faced lie.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.109
- No, it's true.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.178
I was driving down sterling road
and I-I...

03:33.313 --> 03:35.814
Thought I saw you. And uh...

03:37.218 --> 03:39.651
It wasn't you, but I-I got that
happy feeling for a second.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.053
- Yeah?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.988
What you doing on sterling road?

03:43.057 --> 03:44.389
- Just driving around.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.724
Thinking about, uh...

03:46.760 --> 03:49.361
...Everything I've messed up
that you've fixed, you know?

03:49.930 --> 03:50.862
- Hey.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.631
Are you in trouble?

03:53.801 --> 03:54.967
- I'm fine.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.169
- Yep.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.071
- I, uh... I was thinking about
going to...

03:59.073 --> 04:01.439
Florida to stay with grandma for
a little bit over break

04:01.508 --> 04:03.808
And just... You know...

04:03.844 --> 04:05.610
Take it easy and
get a fresh start.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.012
- Why? So she can teach you how
to shoot guns and hate people?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.814
(they chuckle)
- yeah, exactly.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.850
(soft music)

04:14.021 --> 04:16.154
- Hey, why don't you just
hang out here for a bit?

04:16.156 --> 04:17.389
Take a nap.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.692
I'm gonna go get ready for work.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.794
I have a busy day.
- Okay.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.436
<i> (kelly): So, naz is working</i>
<i> with cops</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:33.105
Who are hanging him out to dry,

04:33.107 --> 04:35.841
Letting him get hurt because
he sided with me?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.310
You gotta fire those guys.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.112
- Cops are notoriously hard to
get rid of.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.413
You know that.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.849
I have to finish the
investigation first.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.718
And in the meantime,

04:46.720 --> 04:49.187
I think that you should consider
a change.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.188
- What are you talking about?

04:50.224 --> 04:51.656
- Well, you've been with
drug squad, what?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.124
Over 10 years?

04:53.193 --> 04:55.060
And this keegan thing,
it was a lot.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.861
- So you're gonna punish me!

04:56.930 --> 04:59.063
- I am not punishing you,
kelly.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.298
I am looking out for you.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.401
Yes, I'm gonna be cleaning
house,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.336
But it is a helluva toxic
process

05:04.338 --> 05:06.271
And I do not want you
in the middle of it.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.541
Look, you can always go back!

05:09.610 --> 05:11.676
We can just transfer you to
guns and gangs.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.544
You and wazowski work well
together.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.280
- I can't work under nathan.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.049
- What, are you guys still
a thing?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.752
- I haven't given up
on the idea.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.722
- Well, you can't date your
superior,

05:23.724 --> 05:26.157
So that's not
an option.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.493
(sighing): Look, ciso called

05:28.562 --> 05:30.695
To see if you available
for uc work.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.231
The opp are looking for somebody
with your profile

05:33.267 --> 05:34.800
For a long-term project.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.236
- Yeah?
- Yeah, white collar assignment.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.473
Nice apartment, out of
the city, might be alright.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.242
- Yeah.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.546
<i> (sam): How long of an</i>
<i> undercover-operation?</i>

05:48.782 --> 05:52.217
- I don't know. Three months.
Six months.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.018
- Well, I think it's
a terrible idea,

05:54.054 --> 05:55.787
And I thought about it and
you can't do it,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.188
So, you can't do that.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.256
(kelly scoffs)

05:58.325 --> 05:59.958
- Let's just focus on the
task at hand, alright?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.529
Oh, come on.
Would you stop sulking?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.798
Look, if this is gonna be
our last hurrah,

06:06.933 --> 06:07.932
Let's make it great.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.334
Come on.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.408
- Hurrah.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.411
Uh, hello. No, thank you.
Excuse me!

06:19.480 --> 06:21.413
- Steve evans, I'm representing
ms. Sullivan.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.681
- Oh! You the ex!

06:23.717 --> 06:25.217
This the--
- hm.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.951
- This the gym-teacher ex!

06:26.987 --> 06:28.352
- You're a gym teacher?
(steve): No.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.121
- No, he just cheated on me
with a gym teacher.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.355
What are you doing here?

06:31.392 --> 06:32.391
- Elliot asked me
to represent her.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.025
Couldn't say no.
(sam): Oh, great. This is great.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.893
'cause we should
always say yes to our son,

06:35.929 --> 06:38.029
'cause he never, ever, ever gets
his own way.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.698
She doesn't need her lawyer
present for this, so...

06:39.833 --> 06:40.799
Why don't you go home?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.067
- A good lawyer should be
present.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.969
To protect his client from
accepting a bad deal.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.037
You go home.
- No. You go home.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.971
- No, no, you go home.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.172
- Can I go home?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.373
- Okay, nobody's going home.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.176
And wazowski is not removing
herself from this case.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.977
But maybe you can remove
yourself from the room?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.012
- Yes.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.549
(door closes)

06:58.518 --> 06:59.918
- You're wasting
my client's time.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.587
You don't have evidence against
her, nothing that's gonna stick.

07:02.722 --> 07:03.655
- Oh, yeah? Well...

07:03.657 --> 07:04.922
(inhaling loudly)

07:04.958 --> 07:08.126
Her sister, layna, has agreed
to cooperate and she's confirmed

07:08.128 --> 07:09.995
That they've been bringing drugs
across the border

07:10.130 --> 07:11.663
For months now.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.465
- Okay, well, that's news.
(sighing)

07:13.534 --> 07:14.466
- You're a first-time offender,

07:14.468 --> 07:15.934
So you won't get more
than five years.

07:16.003 --> 07:20.104
But the difference between a few
years in gentlewoman's prison,

07:20.174 --> 07:21.940
Versus five to seven in maximum,

07:21.942 --> 07:23.274
With all that asset forfeiture,

07:23.343 --> 07:24.876
Oof, it's big.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.477
(kelly exhaling): So...

07:26.513 --> 07:28.146
You can let a killer go free

07:28.281 --> 07:29.748
And not have anything to do
with your kid

07:29.883 --> 07:31.216
Until he's a legal adult,

07:31.285 --> 07:33.351
With the exception of the 20
minutes a week you're allowed

07:33.387 --> 07:35.420
For collect phone calls,

07:35.422 --> 07:37.489
<i> And I can assure you,</i>

07:37.558 --> 07:40.492
<i> It's a suboptimal way to forge</i>
<i> a relationship.</i>

07:40.561 --> 07:42.561
Or you can cooperate.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.629
- My client will cooperate
in exchange for immunity.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.165
- It's never gonna happen.
(insistent knocking on mirror)

07:47.234 --> 07:50.034
And, uh, I believe
my colleague's in agreement.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.302
Look, how about this,

07:52.039 --> 07:54.839
You give me a solid way into
bill misiano,

07:54.908 --> 07:57.509
Then, we can talk a deal.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.448
- Bill misiano killed randy
right in front of me.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.383
Shot him in the heart,
didn't even blink.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.318
And he let me live partly
because

08:07.354 --> 08:09.186
I promised to hook him up with
this mdma deal

08:09.223 --> 08:10.121
That randy had in
the works,

08:10.190 --> 08:12.524
But mostly, because
he's a feminist.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.058
- Misiano's a feminist?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.295
<i> - His mother drove a limo</i>
<i> back in the seventies.</i>

08:17.430 --> 08:19.397
He was raised by strong women.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.333
Including a psychic grandmother

08:21.468 --> 08:23.868
And some aunt carmel that knits
his slippers.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.071
- I'm still looking
for a way in.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.540
He collects lighters from
dead people.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.875
Hates bugs, but loves...
Ladybugs.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.045
And he wears windbreakers and
he moonwalks into rooms.

08:34.915 --> 08:35.847
You know...

08:37.417 --> 08:38.416
(kelly):<i> Okay,</i>

08:38.418 --> 08:41.152
Uh, tell me about
this mdma deal.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.555
- Well, I mean, bill's all-in.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.757
He wants to come to town and...

08:45.759 --> 08:47.091
Visit the warehouse.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.762
He thinks he can get the formula
from nelson and then...

08:50.831 --> 08:51.896
Pop him.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.898
- Nelson?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.231
(tiggy): Nelson lam.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.635
Everybody loves his product.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.236
- Where does he make this mdma?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.938
- He has a warehou--

09:00.007 --> 09:01.506
No.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.841
I am not telling you
where the warehouse is, okay?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.343
I need to keep at least

09:05.345 --> 09:06.978
One bargaining chip
in my pocket.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.179
- Well, she's right.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.315
You want to get misiano and
nelson and not talk deal?

09:11.351 --> 09:12.317
Nuh-uh.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.884
- Nuh-uh.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.420
- Only give them the nelson
details

09:15.489 --> 09:16.521
When we have the deal
confirmed.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.189
(knocking on door)
(kelly): It is no-- what?!

09:19.826 --> 09:20.792
- I'll be good.

09:20.861 --> 09:21.993
I'm just bringing some pizza.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.428
- Pizza.
- Ooh!

09:23.563 --> 09:24.929
That's very nice.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.864
Thank you.
(steve): Oh, wow, baby.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.733
(sam): Use a napkin, please.
- Mm.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.868
- Wow. That looks good.

09:30.870 --> 09:31.937
- Is this from our place?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.939
(clears throat)
(kelly): Alright, so...

09:34.708 --> 09:35.974
Keep going.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.144
- Bill wanted me to get him
some women drivers, so...

09:39.146 --> 09:41.746
I said I'd introduce him to some
old friends of mine,

09:41.881 --> 09:44.616
Barb gerber, shirley guzzo.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.484
They were gonna for us
exclusive,

09:46.553 --> 09:48.753
I just haven't set that up yet.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.889
- Tell us more about
this barb and shirley.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.289
- Mm. Met behind bars,

09:52.326 --> 09:53.825
Been inseparable ever since.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.160
<i> (hamm): So let me get</i>
<i> this straight,</i>

09:55.295 --> 09:57.128
You guys are going in as
tiggy's drivers?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.496
- Correct.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.564
Bill misiano gets introduced
to barb gerber, shirley guzzo,

10:00.601 --> 10:01.733
Ideally, they hit it off,

10:01.868 --> 10:03.067
They're swapping stories about
murders,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.703
Assassinations, having a great
ol' time,

10:04.838 --> 10:06.638
And once we get that confession,
bam, you guys come in,

10:06.640 --> 10:07.705
You make the arrest.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.574
But if we don't get the
confession at tiggy's,

10:09.643 --> 10:10.909
Then, we have to go to
the warehouse,

10:10.911 --> 10:13.244
Push a little harder.
But the good news is

10:13.246 --> 10:15.780
Nelson lam's sister just had
a baby in ottawa, so...

10:15.915 --> 10:17.415
He's out of town.
(hamm): Well,

10:17.451 --> 10:18.516
Sounds pretty straightforward.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.084
- In what way, barry?

10:20.887 --> 10:22.120
- Well...
(naz): This kinda play

10:22.122 --> 10:23.655
Takes months to prep!

10:23.790 --> 10:24.588
- I don't know.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.790
- Yeah.
(hamm): More importantly,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.925
Who's gonna be barb
and who's gonna be shirley?

10:27.927 --> 10:28.927
(kelly): Me, I'm shirley.
(sam inhales)

10:28.929 --> 10:30.594
I'm not the barb type.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.864
You know, barb is
a white woman's name.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.200
Barbie. Barbara walters.
Barbara streisand.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.534
- Shirley's a
white woman's name!

10:36.536 --> 10:37.869
Shirley temple,
shirley maclaine.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.437
- Shirley caesar.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.872
Shirley chisholm.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.807
Actually, do you even know
who shirley chisholm is?

10:42.942 --> 10:44.843
- Yes, pff,
I do know who...

10:44.978 --> 10:47.278
She is a beautiful black woman.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.713
- You oughta be ashamed of
yourselves.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.615
Shirley chisholm was the first
black woman elected to congress.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.918
Pff!
- Uh, I am canadian!

10:55.355 --> 10:56.420
(sam): How're we gonna
convince him

10:56.456 --> 10:58.956
That we're capable of
killing someone?

10:59.026 --> 11:02.960
- Easy, just channel all that
anger you got towards your ex.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.096
- I don't want to be angry at
steve anymore.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.498
Just...

11:06.633 --> 11:08.566
I'd like to move on,
you know?

11:08.602 --> 11:10.502
Meet someone nice, like...

11:11.471 --> 11:14.305
I don't know, like a n--
nazeer type of nice.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.973
- Hold up.

11:15.975 --> 11:16.841
I knew it.
- What?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.375
- You like naz!
- I didn't say that.

11:18.412 --> 11:19.978
Is that what I said?
- Yes, you did.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.713
- Uh, no, that is not
what I said,

11:21.715 --> 11:23.047
I said someone "like" naz, okay?
(kelly chuckles)

11:23.083 --> 11:24.849
That is, it's like someone, and
it doesn't even, because,

11:24.984 --> 11:25.817
I don't think it matters
because

11:25.952 --> 11:27.085
He wouldn't want to date me
anyway.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.420
- And why is that?

11:29.856 --> 11:30.989
Why wouldn't he?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.323
Hm?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.324
Look at you.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.460
- That's right.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.464
I'm a catch.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.331
(door opens)

11:40.400 --> 11:41.732
(beauchamp): Oh, hi.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.134
- Hi.
- I hope you don't mind,

11:43.269 --> 11:45.937
Uh, it was burrito night last
night over in 44,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.739
Now you can't pay your way
into the bathroom.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.474
- Oh, no, sure,
make yourself at home.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.408
- Thanks.
(kelly): Yeah.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.876
I was just wondering,
I mean, look,

11:52.011 --> 11:53.378
I know you been hanging out with
nathan,

11:53.513 --> 11:54.545
And that's cool, it is,

11:54.614 --> 11:56.147
But I was just--
(beauchamp): I-I'm not gonna

11:56.216 --> 11:57.148
Have this conversation
with you.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.216
- Yeah, o--
- oh, I am also sorry,

11:59.252 --> 12:01.419
But we are talking through
a uc operation,

12:01.554 --> 12:03.221
It's very important,
it's very top-secret.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.023
- I won't be long.
- It could be number 2.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.224
- Nope, just a number 1.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.259
- You know, you say that now
but things can change, huh?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.527
Catch you right by surprise.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.696
But, uh, there's two other
bathrooms on the top floor,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.698
So you can... Number-2 it
all day long.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.367
- Fine. I'll leave you to it.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.368
(sam): Okay.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.839
- Jesus, wazowski,
what was that about?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.907
- I was just trying to be like,
uh...

12:22.909 --> 12:25.510
Your... I don't know.
- Pff.

12:25.512 --> 12:29.647
- Hey. She seems, like, pleasant
and she's nice, but...

12:29.683 --> 12:30.982
She's not you.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.986
- Of course, she's not.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.255
Nobody's like me.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.824
'cause I'm the duff.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.724
- That's right, you are.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.926
- I'm the duff.
- Yeah.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.195
- Everybody want a bit of
my stuff.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.997
- My stuff.
- 'cause I'm the duff!

12:46.066 --> 12:47.999
- Gettin'--
- come on, let's go get our guy.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.334
(sam): Let's go over
this plan again.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.203
We have known each other since
northumberland collegiate days,

12:52.239 --> 12:54.138
Barb gerber, divorced,
teenage son.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.472
Shirley guzzo,

12:55.509 --> 12:56.875
She's just kind of, like, more,
play-the-field type.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.810
- Okay, which one of you's barb
and which one's shirley again?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.544
- How many times do I have
to tell you?

13:00.580 --> 13:01.780
I am shirley.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.616
- Hm. Okay, well...
Barb's the smart one.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.485
- That doesn't mean
shirley's dumb.

13:08.522 --> 13:09.854
- She's pretty dumb.

13:09.856 --> 13:12.423
(sam): Okay, either way, he is
gonna be here very, very soon.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.892
When he gets here,
you have to stall him.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.092
(tiggy): Yeah, I know the plan.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.961
Should I be the one
to bring up randy?

13:17.030 --> 13:18.296
(kelly): God, no.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.631
We have to let him
take the lead,

13:19.766 --> 13:21.299
He'll get spooked
if we say too much.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.033
- And what if he doesn't
confess?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.169
- Then you give us the address
to the warehouse,

13:25.172 --> 13:28.105
We'll all go together,
and move to plan b.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.008
- Speaking of which, why don't
you just give us the address

13:30.143 --> 13:31.375
To the warehouse now?

13:31.411 --> 13:33.778
- Yes.
- No.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.315
(sam): No, no, no, remember how
I said that I would drive.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.450
- You might've said it, but I
didn't agree with it as well.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.319
- No, no, no, but I put it
on a post-it note.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.254
- I don't care about no post-it
note, you're not driving!

13:43.290 --> 13:44.455
- No, I did, I was like,
"oop"...

13:44.591 --> 13:45.423
(overlapping chatter)
- ladybug!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.426
Did you sense I was here?
How you doing?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.728
These must be my drivers, huh?

13:50.864 --> 13:53.398
- Yeah. These are my friends,
barb gerber.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.132
(kelly, under her breath): No.
- Yeah, I'm shirley guzzo.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.368
Really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, I'm bill.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.471
Time to expand
my resources up here

14:00.507 --> 14:02.907
And nothing better than
starting with women, right?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.075
I looked into you guys,
you know, and well,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.344
You seem legit.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.412
We ready? Warehouse?
Let's go.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.547
(tiggy): Oh, yeah, sure.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.081
We just gotta wait
for the text from nelson,

14:11.117 --> 14:12.216
What time to meet up.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.653
He's aiming for around 1:00.
- Oh.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.124
Hey, gives a chance to
get to know one another, right?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.926
(misiano, through wire):
<i> Turn the kettle on, yeah?</i>

14:22.062 --> 14:23.627
(hamm):
Yo, I think you're right.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.430
Misiano's not gonna admit to
anything unless we push him.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.700
I say we go directly to plan b.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.369
- Let's wait.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.504
There's something about
kelly's believability

14:33.540 --> 14:35.707
And sam's...
- Annoyability.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.174
- No, her...

14:37.176 --> 14:38.242
- Relentlessness?

14:38.278 --> 14:39.644
(misiano):<i> Nice place, ladybug.</i>

14:39.646 --> 14:42.179
(sighing): Look, man, I-I've
seen them work miracles, okay?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.915
- Ha. Meh.
We'll see about that.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.184
(misiano):
<i> I could've told you that.</i>

14:46.319 --> 14:47.785
<i> I'm very intuitive.</i>

14:47.821 --> 14:49.454
<i> It comes from the women</i>
<i> in my family.</i>

14:49.589 --> 14:50.454
(ringing on line)

14:50.523 --> 14:51.922
(cell phone rings)

14:51.958 --> 14:53.724
(sighing): Excuse me.
- Thanks.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.926
- Hello?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.295
What?
- Sugar?

14:57.364 --> 14:58.329
(kelly):
You're kidding me, right?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.698
That is the dead
opposite of okay!

15:01.501 --> 15:03.167
Look, bring it today, barry,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.637
Or you don't get another chance,
alright?

15:06.806 --> 15:08.506
- What's going on there,
barbie?

15:10.209 --> 15:11.776
- You don't want to know
all my problems.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.678
- Oh, I like problems.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.946
Call me weird, but I do.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.480
You know why?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.249
Because there's always
a solution.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.216
Talk to me.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.785
You mind?
- Not-not at all.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.219
Uh, one of randy's guys
owes barb money,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.420
But like, a lot of money.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.956
He thinks he can pull one over
on her.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.957
- You know, I think he's trying
to call my bluff.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.826
Him and randy, oof!

15:28.895 --> 15:30.494
Cut from the same cloth,
the two of them,

15:30.563 --> 15:32.096
No respect for women
at all.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.365
- I know exactly what
you're saying. I hate that!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.633
- He ripped me off,
he won't return my phone calls.

15:36.670 --> 15:37.702
(tiggy): Oh, he'll return mine.

15:37.704 --> 15:38.970
Let me handle it for you, okay?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.037
I'll get your money.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.072
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.807
I'm gonna handle this
on my own.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.642
It's a matter of pride,
you know what I'm saying?

15:44.711 --> 15:45.943
People can't walk all over you!
- No.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.444
- Yeah, but if
you take out barry,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.246
Reg is gonna hit back.
- Who's reg?

15:49.248 --> 15:50.714
(sam): Oh...
- Barry and reg,

15:50.750 --> 15:51.983
They popped randy.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.790
- Oh, yeah.
(tiggy): Oh, is that right?

15:59.859 --> 16:02.794
Maybe bill could ease your mind
about that.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.439
- This, uh, nelson guy,

16:14.441 --> 16:16.674
He'd better be texting you soon.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.042
(kelly): Uh, yeah.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.144
- You don't think misiano's
getting spooked?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.346
- No, no, no.
Kelly's got this.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.082
It's why I call her
the nicholson.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.016
(misiano):<i> My aunt carmel...</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:26.150
- What do you call me?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.285
- We don't.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.688
- Well, I mean,
if you were to give me a name,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.424
What would it be?
(naz exhales, annoyed)

16:33.559 --> 16:35.026
- The hasselhoff?

16:36.296 --> 16:38.996
(misiano): Hey, ladybug,
who's got the keys to the van?

16:39.032 --> 16:41.099
I want to hear how she runs.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.300
"she." sorry.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.501
My bad.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.705
It's an old habit of mine
to refer to a vehicle as "she".

16:47.707 --> 16:49.573
Truth be told, though,

16:49.609 --> 16:53.378
People call ships and cars "she"
'cause they hold precious cargo.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.611
- Keys are inside.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.847
- Okay, start her up.
(sam): 'kay!

16:55.982 --> 16:57.281
- I want to hear how she growls.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.315
Barb, go outside, would you?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.418
I want to have a word with
ladybug alone.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.652
(kelly): Yeah.
- All the way out.

17:01.654 --> 17:02.687
- Okay.

17:04.857 --> 17:09.227
You. You've got to aim for more
"lady" and less "bug".

17:10.730 --> 17:12.596
- What does that mean?
- What was that?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.599
Upstairs, from randy bowen.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.934
- I don't know.
I thought it was funny.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.202
- You know what?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.471
I've given you a couple of
chances now, which I never do,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.473
And now, you annoy me.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.876
When I get annoyed,
I get impulsive,

17:25.011 --> 17:27.011
So I've got to calm myself down.

17:27.013 --> 17:30.414
So I'm taking your van,
I'm taking your girls,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.150
You're staying here,
you're on a time-out.

17:32.852 --> 17:33.885
(tiggy scoffs): It's--

17:34.020 --> 17:37.622
Hey! They're not girls,
they're women.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.559
- Women! Right. Got it.
Let's go, barb.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.228
This nelson guy,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.563
We're not waiting for him
no more.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.831
Take me to this warehouse.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.100
Let's go.
- Okay, uh, just what about tig?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.668
- Let's go!
- Okay.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.951
(naz): Get down! Get down!

18:10.389 --> 18:11.255
- Okay, I'll get tiggy,

18:11.324 --> 18:12.923
You tail them.
- Okay.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.492
(engine turns)

18:19.665 --> 18:22.266
(exhaling loudly): Damn it!

18:27.107 --> 18:29.674
(soft music)

18:34.447 --> 18:37.748
(children talking indistinctly,
laughter)

18:52.732 --> 18:54.365
(softly, echoing): Hey, baby.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.070
Psst! Sol!

19:00.140 --> 19:02.640
(maureen): Lunch is on
the table!

19:02.775 --> 19:05.642
(laughter)

19:05.678 --> 19:07.578
(sol): Grams, what are you
doing?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.614
Why are you dressed up
as a dinosaur?

19:09.616 --> 19:12.283
- Who're you calling dinosaur?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.718
(laughter)

19:14.787 --> 19:17.020
(sol laughs): I'm too old
for dinosaurs!

19:17.056 --> 19:19.590
- Oh, too old for spaghetti
and meatballs?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.859
I got some fresh cookies
in the oven,

19:21.994 --> 19:24.194
If you eat your lunch first.
(excited exclamation)

19:24.230 --> 19:25.663
Come on! Let's go!

19:25.665 --> 19:28.332
(maureen hums happily)

19:29.402 --> 19:30.501
(laughter)

19:38.945 --> 19:40.311
(sniffling)

19:45.251 --> 19:47.018
- Figured you'd be here.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.021
- Hey.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.758
There's no force field.
(jackie): I know.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.960
I don't think I should be here
though, elliot.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.995
- Come on, it's fine.
She's not even home.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.198
You good?
- Yeah.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.173
Do you think they really
left town?

20:09.242 --> 20:11.375
'cause I think they're trying
to rip us off.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.677
(elliot sighs)

20:13.646 --> 20:15.112
- I don't know.

20:16.082 --> 20:16.914
Uh...

20:19.085 --> 20:21.385
Maybe I could get my grandmother
to transfer us money

20:21.421 --> 20:23.054
To go visit her or something.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.657
How much do you think gas money
is to boca raton?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.726
(cell phone vibrates)
- uh...

20:28.728 --> 20:29.694
(elliot sighs)

20:32.198 --> 20:33.664
- Hey, bodhi.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.132
<i> Uh, I'm just here with jackie.</i>

20:35.134 --> 20:36.734
- Good. Where are you guys?

20:36.803 --> 20:37.969
- Uh...

20:38.871 --> 20:39.603
My house.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.140
- Oh, okay. Cool, look,

20:43.142 --> 20:44.742
I know you guys
want to get paid,

20:44.877 --> 20:46.610
So I thought we could meet
at the warehouse.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.479
<i> Get you guys settled up.</i>

20:48.614 --> 20:50.881
- I thought nelson was away
and he didn't want people there.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.215
<i>- The money's at the warehouse.</i>

20:52.252 --> 20:54.518
He said I could pay you, but
hey, if you're cool to wait.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.153
- No, no, no, it's fine.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.355
It's fine. We're gonna
be there.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.457
- Good.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.562
- Okay.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.430
Maybe they're not trying
to rip us off.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.170
- You know, you're kinda driving

21:13.306 --> 21:14.605
Like you don't know
where you're going.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.841
- That's because there's traffic
in the gta.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.243
And-and she took a wrong turn.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.513
See, normally, I do
all the driving.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.448
(sam): You were so stressed out,
babe,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.050
I just wanted to give you
a break.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.385
- Oof.
- Oh, see, right there,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.119
That's true friendship,
you know.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.921
Really, I like that.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.189
I like that a lot.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.792
Tiggy mentioned something about
sterling road, right?

21:34.861 --> 21:37.127
What's the exact address?
And I'll put it in my phone.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.229
(kelly): Yea-- we-we'll
recognize it when we see it.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.931
- I'm finding it really hard
to concentrate,

21:40.933 --> 21:42.065
I'm so sorry, I gotta pee.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.801
I've been holding it
for so long, I gott--

21:43.803 --> 21:44.935
- Right there,
that's another burden

21:45.071 --> 21:46.337
You women have to carry,
right.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.871
Us guys, we can just pee
out the window,

21:47.940 --> 21:50.207
I can pee in this coffee cup,
it's easy-peasy.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.475
But you guys,
you gotta hold it in,

21:51.610 --> 21:54.278
And sometimes, if you hold it
in, you can get a uti.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.347
You know what a uti is?
- Yes.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.882
- Do you?
- Yeah.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.216
- Yeah, I bet you do.

21:59.285 --> 22:02.887
Just, let's find a gas station
so shirley can take a pee.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.689
A nice, long pee.
- Thank you.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.291
- I think there's one up here.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.760
- Bodhi?

22:09.895 --> 22:11.796
(cell phone vibrates)
hello?

22:14.233 --> 22:16.633
- Uh... I can't really talk
right now, but...

22:16.669 --> 22:18.636
Are you okay?
(sam):<i> Not really.</i>

22:18.771 --> 22:20.638
Listen, elliot,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.774
I really need to know where
nelson lam's warehouse is

22:23.843 --> 22:25.242
<i> On sterling road.</i>

22:25.378 --> 22:27.044
<i> I really, really hope that</i>
<i> you do not work there,</i>

22:27.113 --> 22:29.913
<i> And I strongly advise you</i>
<i> not to be anywhere near there</i>

22:29.982 --> 22:31.515
But if you do know where it is,

22:31.650 --> 22:32.983
I would be eternally grateful.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.953
(softly): Hm.

22:36.922 --> 22:37.888
- Uh...

22:39.926 --> 22:42.059
Okay, look,
do you still have that app

22:42.194 --> 22:43.594
That you used to stalk me on?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.930
- I do. But you blocked me.
(exhaling shakily)

22:46.065 --> 22:47.798
<i> - Alright, I'm gonna</i>
<i> unblock you, okay?</i>

22:47.867 --> 22:49.133
- Thank you.

22:50.103 --> 22:53.604
Elliot, you've got 10 minutes
to get the hell out of there.

22:53.739 --> 22:54.672
Do you understand?

22:54.807 --> 22:55.806
- Got it.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.311
Jackie!

23:01.080 --> 23:02.078
Jack?

23:02.115 --> 23:03.714
- What are we doing here, man,
come on?

23:03.716 --> 23:04.515
(elliot): Jack, we gotta go!

23:04.650 --> 23:05.582
(jackie): What are we doing?

23:05.651 --> 23:06.851
- We gotta go!
(jackie): Hey!

23:06.986 --> 23:08.351
- Hey, man, what's going on?
(jackie): Hey!

23:08.388 --> 23:09.920
- Get away from her!

23:10.055 --> 23:11.021
(jackie gasps)

23:12.392 --> 23:14.558
- Nelson and I, we did some
digging into you

23:14.627 --> 23:17.161
And we found out about
your momma.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.628
(snorts like a pig)

23:18.664 --> 23:20.231
- Yeah, so what?

23:20.366 --> 23:22.065
(jackie):
Yo, he's a drug dealer, man.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.034
What, you think he tells his mom
what he's up to?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.069
- Well, I told nelson

23:25.204 --> 23:27.104
I'd leave it to him to deal with
when he's back.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.840
(chuckling nervously): Yeah,
you all think I'm the crazy one,

23:29.842 --> 23:30.908
Well, nelson...

23:33.045 --> 23:34.078
Children first.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.380
- Come on.
(bodhi): Come on!

23:42.021 --> 23:43.420
- Where are we going?

23:43.456 --> 23:44.955
- Right in here.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.757
Go.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.795
- Hey, hey!

23:54.967 --> 23:56.200
- Where's your phone?

23:56.269 --> 23:58.235
- I don't know, man,
I left it at home, I guess.

24:00.506 --> 24:01.738
(jackie): No, no, no, no!
(elliot): Hey!

24:01.740 --> 24:02.806
(jackie): Hey!

24:02.842 --> 24:04.208
(door rattling)

24:07.180 --> 24:08.078
(jackie grunting softly)

24:08.147 --> 24:09.213
Oh my god.

24:09.348 --> 24:10.314
Oh my god.
- Uh...

24:10.449 --> 24:12.215
- It's locked.
- It's locked?

24:12.251 --> 24:13.817
- What do we do? What do we do?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.219
- I don't know, man.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.756
It's okay. We're gonna--
it's gonna be okay.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.030
- Tell me, why did we leave
tiggy behind?

24:26.165 --> 24:27.431
- She was getting on my nerves.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.234
(kelly): Well, she is our
only plug, though, so, uh...

24:30.303 --> 24:31.302
I don't know.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.769
I don't really know
this nelson guy.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.771
- Well, we're gonna get to know
this nelson guy.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.106
And we're gonna be
our own plugs.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.575
- Hey!

24:38.077 --> 24:39.577
Here we are.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.198
- It's kinda spooky.
But I like it.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.936
- Alright, so what are we doing?

25:05.938 --> 25:07.538
- I gave naz the coordinates.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.272
We're moving to plan b.
(kelly exhales loudly)

25:09.308 --> 25:10.441
- Good job.

25:14.747 --> 25:15.813
(misiano): Wow.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.480
Whoa.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.516
(door slams shut)
ha! Ha!

25:19.519 --> 25:22.018
- Mr. Misiano!
Nelson lam.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.287
It's great to meet you.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.356
- Wow, it's a helluva place
you got here, huh?

25:25.491 --> 25:26.290
(naz chuckles): Yeah.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.223
(stairs clunking)
(kelly groans)

25:27.260 --> 25:28.492
- Watch your step there,
shirley.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.227
Hey, barb.
- That's barb.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.695
That's shirley back there.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.230
- Yeah, everyone is always
mixing us up.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.431
- Yeah.
- It's just...

25:34.467 --> 25:37.334
- It's like, we're attached
at the hip. So...

25:37.403 --> 25:40.204
(misiano): So, tell me about
this place, huh?

25:40.206 --> 25:42.305
- Well, it, uh, used to be
an old power plant.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.441
My dad was gonna
turn it into condos,

25:44.510 --> 25:46.710
But... Well, then, he died.
- Oh, too bad.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.112
- So, for now,

25:48.114 --> 25:51.314
This is my lab.
We make our product right here.

25:51.350 --> 25:55.986
- So, tell me,
exactly how do you do it?

25:56.956 --> 25:59.590
- We-- I mean, I have
a master's in chemistry,

25:59.659 --> 26:01.191
It's--
- how do you make it?

26:01.227 --> 26:02.659
- Chemistry.
I was gonna say that we--

26:02.695 --> 26:04.461
There's a whole process of
distilling, decanting,

26:04.530 --> 26:06.763
Titration, refluxing.

26:06.832 --> 26:07.931
I've been here for months

26:07.934 --> 26:10.467
Working on my
very specific formula.

26:10.536 --> 26:11.802
- You're a pro.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.237
- I'd like to think so.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.139
Is, uh, is tiggy gonna be
joining us?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.607
I thought she was...

26:16.609 --> 26:17.675
Or should we just go ahead

26:17.810 --> 26:19.243
With the walk-through, then?
(man): Hello?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.278
Hello?

26:23.583 --> 26:24.715
(yelling): Hello?!

26:26.152 --> 26:27.150
- You didn't really think

26:27.219 --> 26:29.086
I was gonna get left behind,
did you, bill?

26:29.155 --> 26:31.421
- Ladybug! You are impressive!

26:31.457 --> 26:32.890
(whispering): Come here,
come here.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.425
- What's up?
- That's barry.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.093
That's the guy who owes me
the money.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.628
- That's the guy
you gotta take out?

26:37.763 --> 26:39.296
This is a good place
to do it,

26:39.298 --> 26:41.565
It's easy to make it look
like an accident here.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.435
But you cannot let a man
take advantage of you.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.802
(naz): Tiggy!

26:45.838 --> 26:47.104
Nice of you to join us.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.772
(hamm, australian accent):
Good day, ladies.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.977
It's been awhile.
(kelly): Yeah.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.345
'cause you been ripping me off.

26:55.348 --> 26:56.513
You bring my money?

26:56.515 --> 26:58.782
- Oh, now, don't get your
titties in a twist, love.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.583
I'll pay you when I pay you.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.119
(tiggy): Barry.
(hamm): What?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.554
She's being a right bitch.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.024
- Oh yeah,
"better bitch than mouse".

27:07.159 --> 27:08.324
(gunshot)
- oh!

27:08.361 --> 27:09.359
(sam): Oh my god!

27:09.395 --> 27:10.327
Oh my god, oh my god!

27:10.396 --> 27:11.594
Oh my god!
(naz): What the hell?

27:11.631 --> 27:13.230
- Jesus! What happened to making
it look like an accident?

27:13.365 --> 27:14.331
(naz panting)

27:14.466 --> 27:16.500
(kelly): What did I do?
Reg is gonna kill me!

27:16.635 --> 27:17.601
(sam): I got you!

27:17.736 --> 27:19.102
Come on, let me think,
just let me think.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.070
(moaning)

27:20.205 --> 27:21.572
(misiano): What di--
no, no, no, no!

27:21.707 --> 27:23.140
What are you doing?
Don't touch, don't touch.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.108
Your hands.
You got no gloves on.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.776
You're gonna
put your fingerprints
all over the body.

27:26.812 --> 27:27.578
- Oh, god!

27:27.713 --> 27:29.146
- What do I do?
- I don't know.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.281
- What do I do?!
- Stop, stop, I don't know!

27:31.283 --> 27:32.549
Let me think! Let me think!

27:32.551 --> 27:34.151
- No, no.
I don't want you in this. Okay?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.752
I don't want you
a part of my mess.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.387
I'm sorry.
- Listen to me, look at me,

27:37.423 --> 27:39.355
Look at me. Your mess
is my mess. Do you hear me?

27:39.392 --> 27:40.624
I am not gonna lose you.

27:40.626 --> 27:41.825
(kelly whispers): I'm scared.
(sam): Don't be scared.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.761
- Please, don't leave me, shir--
- I'm not gonna leave you.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.828
I'm right--
- please don't leave me.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.163
(kelly indistinctly)
- I'm not gonna leave you,

27:46.165 --> 27:46.963
Honey, I'm right here.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.465
I'm right here, okay?
- Okay.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.966
- Look at me. Yeah.
(kelly): Okay.

27:49.968 --> 27:50.834
- No, you are--
- what?

27:50.903 --> 27:51.769
- You're my best friend.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.103
You really are.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.171
(kelly): I can't go back
to prison.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.106
(sam): Look at me, we're gonna
figure this out.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.108
Okay, okay, I got it.
I gotta get rid of the body.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.510
Go to the head, I got the feet.
- I pick it up?

28:00.579 --> 28:01.845
- I got the feet, yeah.
I'm gonna--

28:01.847 --> 28:02.912
And we're gonna
get in the truck--

28:02.948 --> 28:04.414
- No.
- And then, we're gonna go home.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.983
We're gonna drive home,
but like, super fast.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.518
Back to the apartment, we're
gonna pack everything we have.

28:07.653 --> 28:08.786
(kelly): What are we doing?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.187
- Oh my god, oh my god!
(indistinct chatter)

28:10.322 --> 28:12.055
(sam): ...He's gonna kill you,
but he's gonna have

28:12.091 --> 28:13.190
To kill me too. I'm gonna die!

28:13.192 --> 28:14.791
- Oh my god!
- You can't die for me!

28:14.827 --> 28:16.059
- I am gonna die!
- You guys.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.927
- I will die for you!
- Chill out.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.463
Chill out.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.599
I don't know who
this reg guy is, okay,

28:22.668 --> 28:25.001
But he didn't kill randy.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.137
Neither did this barry guy.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.006
- Why would-- what?
Yes, they did.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.474
Everybody knows that,
they killed him.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.143
- No, no. No, they don't,
and if they do, they're wrong.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.012
It's a free country, they can
think whatever they like.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.313
You're gonna be alright.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.981
Breathe, come on.

28:37.983 --> 28:40.150
You're not gonna have
to leave town, there.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.685
You're not gonna get killed,

28:41.820 --> 28:43.821
You're not gonna die.

28:45.491 --> 28:50.093
Believe me, ladies, things
aren't as bad as they seem.

28:50.162 --> 28:54.297
Just between us,
this reg and barry guy,

28:54.366 --> 28:57.568
They didn't kill randy.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.203
Because...

29:01.440 --> 29:02.706
The guy's still alive.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.007
(sam): Oh.
(misiano): Oh, yeah.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.642
What do you want to do
with this guy?

29:05.644 --> 29:07.677
Do you want to finish him off,
barb, or you want me to?

29:07.713 --> 29:09.446
(kelly and sam): No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

29:09.448 --> 29:10.881
(man): What the hell's going on
in here?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.185
- Who-who're you, now?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.554
- I'm nelson lam.
I own this place.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.267
Tiggy. Are you playing me?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.068
'cause I just found out
jackie's boyfriend

29:32.104 --> 29:34.772
Has a cop for a mother
and-and-and-and...

29:36.208 --> 29:37.541
Who the hell's this guy?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.742
- Wait a minute.

29:38.877 --> 29:41.278
You are nelson lam.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.618
You're working with cops?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.287
- Ugh!
(kelly): Get down!

29:50.356 --> 29:51.255
Everybody down!

29:56.528 --> 29:58.595
- Oh my god, those are gunshots.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.933
(kelly): Is everybody okay?

30:03.068 --> 30:03.767
(hamm): Yeah.
(naz): Yeah. Yeah.

30:03.902 --> 30:04.768
I'm going for misiano!

30:04.770 --> 30:06.102
- I got lam!

30:06.138 --> 30:07.905
- No, no, she's breathing,
she's breathing. Go after him!

30:10.176 --> 30:11.441
(tiggy moaning): It hurts.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.179
T!

30:16.182 --> 30:17.915
- That's definitely
my mother.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.250
- What do you mean, your mother?

30:20.286 --> 30:21.518
How would your mother know
that you're here?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.053
- It doesn't matter.
Hey, mom!

30:23.122 --> 30:24.454
Mom!

30:24.590 --> 30:28.158
We're in here!
Help!

30:31.030 --> 30:32.629
(elliot): Hello!
(clanging)

30:33.265 --> 30:35.933
Hello! Mom!

30:36.068 --> 30:37.401
(clanging)

30:37.536 --> 30:39.670
Somebody! We're in here!

30:42.208 --> 30:43.674
Mom!

30:47.947 --> 30:50.714
Hello! Somebody!

30:52.885 --> 30:54.284
- Don't move!

30:54.353 --> 30:56.353
I said, "don't move!"

30:57.022 --> 30:59.089
- Nelson lam,
you're under arrest.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.357
Turn around.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.893
- Hello! Somebody!

31:03.929 --> 31:05.696
Help!

31:05.831 --> 31:08.298
(thudding)
- elliot?

31:08.334 --> 31:09.732
Listen.
- Yeah?

31:09.768 --> 31:10.667
(creaking)

31:10.802 --> 31:12.702
- Listen, listen, listen.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.638
(door thuds)

31:14.707 --> 31:15.906
(footsteps approaching)

31:20.613 --> 31:21.812
(door opens)

31:23.048 --> 31:24.481
(gasping)

31:24.483 --> 31:25.882
(elliot): Who are you?
- Uh...

31:25.918 --> 31:27.584
I'm a-I'm a cop.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.921
I'm-I'm-I'm working undercover.
I'm-I'm here with your mother.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.523
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's get out of here.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.590
Drop those.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.526
Down the hall.
Down the hall.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.761
Come on.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.801
(indistinct chatter)
(elliot): Where're we going?

31:44.803 --> 31:47.470
(misiano): We're gonna take
those stairs. Go, go, go.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.873
Keep going, all the way down
this way.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.809
Okay, there's stairs
right there.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.711
We're gonna take those stairs.
Go, go, go.

31:55.681 --> 31:56.580
- Hey!

31:57.416 --> 31:59.516
- Mom!
- It's okay.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.720
Let him go.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.089
Now!

32:09.828 --> 32:10.928
Please.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.697
- Come and get him... Cop.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.732
- Put your gun down.
(misiano): No.

32:18.637 --> 32:19.469
- Me first.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.905
Okay?
(misiano): Yeah.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.109
(misiano grunts)

32:26.244 --> 32:27.611
(jackie): No!
- Elliot!

32:27.746 --> 32:28.879
(jackie): No!
(elliot): Mom!

32:29.014 --> 32:30.980
(jackie): Elliot!
(sam): Elliot! No!

32:31.016 --> 32:31.848
(jackie): Elliot!

32:31.850 --> 32:33.116
- Go get help!
(elliot): Mom!

32:33.118 --> 32:34.518
Help!
- Elliot, hold on!

32:34.653 --> 32:36.119
- Help. Mom...
- Don't look down.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.255
(grunting): Hold on, baby,
hold on! I got you!

32:39.325 --> 32:40.724
(elliot): Help.
- Don't let go, honey.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.191
Don't let go, baby.

32:42.227 --> 32:43.293
(jackie): Somebody, help!

32:43.295 --> 32:44.527
(sam): Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.196
Don't let go!
(jackie): Elliot needs help!

32:46.198 --> 32:47.130
(sam speaks indistinctly)

32:47.132 --> 32:47.998
(elliot groans)
- elliot!

32:48.133 --> 32:50.467
No, no, no! Don't let go,
don't let go!

32:50.469 --> 32:52.235
(elliot): Ah!
- No, no, no, stay, stay,

32:52.371 --> 32:54.037
Stay with me. Stay with me,
stay with me, love.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.305
(crying): Look at me,
look at me.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.140
Look at me, I need you
to hold my hand

32:57.209 --> 32:58.742
Because I'm gonna pull you up--
(elliot): No, mom!

32:58.744 --> 32:59.876
You're not strong enough.

32:59.878 --> 33:00.944
- I can still carry you.

33:00.946 --> 33:01.944
(elliot): No, you can't,
you can't.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.146
- Yes, I can.
(elliot): Mom, no.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.881
I'm gonna die.
- I'm right here, look at me.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.550
Elliot, I am right here.
(elliot): Mom, I'm gonna die.

33:06.685 --> 33:07.884
- I'm right here.
(elliot): I'm gonna die.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.952
- Help!

33:09.087 --> 33:11.421
Somebody! Help!

33:11.457 --> 33:13.690
- Breathe...
(jackie): Mom, help!

33:13.825 --> 33:15.492
Elliot needs help! Quick!

33:15.627 --> 33:16.860
He fell over--

33:16.995 --> 33:18.294
He's over the edge. Mom? Mom?!

33:18.364 --> 33:19.996
- Okay, get over here,
get over here now!

33:19.999 --> 33:21.631
Keep pressure
on this wound, okay?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.433
She'll be fine.
(tiggy moaning)

33:23.469 --> 33:24.600
- Mom.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.503
Mom, what happened?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.350
He needs your help.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.185
What's it gonna be?
(elliot screams)

33:42.187 --> 33:44.720
You gonna arrest the bad guy

You don't care.
He's screaming.

Three major arrests,

37:20.672 --> 37:23.473
Including a confession from
randy bowen's killer.

37:23.475 --> 37:26.209

my favourite day.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.383
- Here comes the screws.

They gonna take all the credit,

You started it with keegan,

38:18.030 --> 38:20.463
I'm more than happy
to finish it off.

38:20.598 --> 38:22.565

I can stay?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.004

39:20.359 --> 39:21.891
- Oh my god, don't be sorry,
I like it.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.326
I mean, I mean, not in a pervy
kind of way, more like a...

39:24.363 --> 39:25.595
"he's not so perfect,

39:25.597 --> 39:27.630
You don't need to be so
intimidated by him" kind of way.

39:27.766 --> 39:28.697
- Intimidated...

39:28.734 --> 39:30.800
You do not have to be
intimidated by me.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.203
Trust me, I'm full of flaws.
- Yeah, right.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.005
- It's funny, uh...

39:36.007 --> 39:37.339
I was talking to hamm

39:37.376 --> 39:40.009
And we were trying to, uh,
figure out the right word

39:40.145 --> 39:42.746
To describe why you're so good
at your job.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.381
- Hm. Annoyability.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.417
Relentlessness.
- It's heart.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.353
You got a lot of heart, sam.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.155

(muttering indistinctly)

41:13.371 --> 41:15.438
(sam): Hey! Hey.

41:15.573 --> 41:18.508
- Hey, well, I'm officially done

41:18.510 --> 41:19.642

41:19.678 --> 41:20.910
I just...

41:20.946 --> 41:23.246
Want to do a little toast
to you before you go.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.181
- Oh, yeah, sure!
- Okay, hold on.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.852
Wait right there.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.654
- I'm not gonna miss this
for anything.

41:31.789 --> 41:34.557
- Bam. Bam.

41:36.060 --> 41:36.960
There you go.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.130
- Mm! Nice!

41:41.199 --> 41:42.398
- Okay.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.466
I know that I get
on your nerves.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.370
I know that potentially
I'm a little bit annoying...

41:47.439 --> 41:48.738
- A little bit. But okay.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.507
- But I know that you like me.

41:50.642 --> 41:51.674
And I know that you see me.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.476
- Sorry... Uh, this toast

41:53.478 --> 41:55.277
Is supposed to be my toast,

- Okay, try again.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.949
(chuckling)

42:00.084 --> 42:03.286
- I have done this job
for over 20 years,

42:03.288 --> 42:06.422
And now, I can't imagine doing
another day of it without you.

42:08.827 --> 42:09.859
- Same, same.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.866
Ooh!
- Oh, my.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.101
(kelly): That was nice.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.802
- Wait. Wait a second.
Hold on.

42:19.804 --> 42:20.937
Did you just...

42:22.073 --> 42:23.238
Did you just say, "same, same"?

42:23.275 --> 42:25.775
Like you feel the same way?
- I feel...

42:25.844 --> 42:28.244
...Feel the same thing.
- Oh, my god.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.781
I'm gonna miss you so much.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.248
(kelly): Alright,
keep your pants on.

42:33.285 --> 42:35.985
I may be done with drug squad,
but I'm not going undercover,

42:36.021 --> 42:38.921
I'm actually... I'm coming over
to guns and gangs.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.356
- Liar.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.792
(scoffing)

42:43.595 --> 42:45.128
- I'm not lying.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.462
- What?!
- Okay, stop hitting me.

42:46.598 --> 42:47.930
- Oh my god!
- S--

42:47.999 --> 42:49.932
Okay, I haven't... Signed
my contract yet,

42:50.001 --> 42:51.400
Don't make me reconsider!
Stop it!

42:51.436 --> 42:53.603
- Oh my god!
We're gonna be partners.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.138
Are we gonna be partners?
- That's a stretch.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.472
- We're gonna be like,
bff partners.

42:56.541 --> 42:57.740
Like, our desks are gonna be
side-by-side,

42:57.809 --> 42:59.475
Talking all day long.
It's gonna be great!

42:59.544 --> 43:01.944
- Okay, hit me one more time,
watch what I'm gonna do to you.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.746
- Oh!
- Ah! See that? See that?

43:03.782 --> 43:05.481
- I can get out of this.
- No, you can't.

43:05.517 --> 43:06.749
- Yeah, I can. Watch.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.084
(bickering continues)

43:08.153 --> 43:09.986
(soft pop music continues)

43:12.190 --> 43:13.756
(hamm screams)

43:13.792 --> 43:14.924
(high-pitched): Snake!
