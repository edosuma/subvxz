00:02.002 --> 00:03.960
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s, my mom didn't go into an office

00:04.047 --> 00:05.831
but she did have
an important job,

00:05.918 --> 00:07.833
getting the Goldbergs' day
off and running,

00:07.920 --> 00:09.531
and it all started
with a hearty breakfast.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.968
Ghostbusters cereal
for my little Marshmallow Man.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.536
Crunchin' makes me
feel good!

00:14.623 --> 00:18.714
Triple protein, quadruple egg,
and quintuple cheese omelet
for my grizzly Barry.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.804
My body will turn
all of this into muscle
immediately. Watch.

00:21.891 --> 00:25.068
Erica, Raisin Bran
with a prune juice chaser.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.462
What's good for the heart
is also good for the bottom.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.333
Gah, Mom!
But also, thank you.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.943
Bevy,
which shirt do I like?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.771
ADULT ADAM:
My mom was also
our in-house stylist.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.512
Left hand.
And which pants
do I like?

00:34.599 --> 00:36.601
The ones you're wearing.
That's why I put 'em on!

00:36.688 --> 00:38.908
I know what looks good.
You really do.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.041
Now go change your socks.
They're two different colors.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.259
Oh, yeah.
I'll be right back.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.695
She was also our pharmacist.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.394
Blood pressure, cholesterol,
heartburn, and dewormer.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.831
Dewormer? What
aren't you telling me?

00:48.918 --> 00:50.702
Not for you, Dad,
for Lucky.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.835
Who's my little dumper?

00:52.922 --> 00:54.228
And when she sent us off,

00:54.315 --> 00:56.230
that's when my mom's work
really began.

00:56.317 --> 00:59.015
Yes, I'm calling
about my flight
to Fort Lauderdale,

00:59.102 --> 01:01.148
which might as well
have been to hell

01:01.235 --> 01:04.107
because that's what my back
and upper groin have been in
since we landed.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.457
What does "TWA"
stand for, anyway?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.503
"The Worst Airline"?

01:08.590 --> 01:10.809
You know what, Wayne?
Just connect me
to your supervisor.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.682
I'm gonna need to speak
to your supervisor, Lydia.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.554
You know what?
I need to talk to
your supervisor.

01:16.641 --> 01:17.903
Just connect me
to your supervisor.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.167
Well, maybe your supervisor
feels differently.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.559
Let me speak
to someone higher.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.561
Well, maybe
your supervisor
can help me.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.955
You know what?
I demand to speak
to your supervisor.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.523
Oh, you're the CEO?

01:28.610 --> 01:30.264
Well, then, I'm gonna need
two first-class tickets

01:30.351 --> 01:32.135
and a mess of
those little pretzel bags.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.137
After cleaning, couponing,
and complaining,

01:34.224 --> 01:35.834
my mom sped off
to do her favorite thing...

01:35.921 --> 01:37.749
Shopping and errands.

01:37.836 --> 01:41.144
Yep, Beverly Goldberg
was an unstoppable force!

01:41.231 --> 01:43.015
BEVERLY: Damn it!

01:43.103 --> 01:45.061
What is wrong with you?

01:45.148 --> 01:47.977
Nobody stops
at that stop sign!

01:48.064 --> 01:49.674
♪ I'm twisted up inside

01:49.761 --> 01:52.547
♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:55.550 --> 01:57.160
♪ I don't know the future

01:57.247 --> 02:00.598
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

02:00.685 --> 02:02.557
ADULT ADAM:
It was March 6th,
1980-something,

02:02.644 --> 02:04.820
and, after weeks
of mending a broken heart,

02:04.907 --> 02:07.344
my brother was finally ready
to get back to normal life.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.520
Buenos dias,
jota-te-pe!

02:09.607 --> 02:11.522
JTP: Jota-te-pe!
Are we doing Spanish now?

02:11.609 --> 02:14.438
Elshut up-o,
Mateo Bradley!

02:14.525 --> 02:15.787
Gentleman, I know
I've been distracted

02:15.874 --> 02:17.441
by the whole Lainey drama,

02:17.528 --> 02:19.226
but fear not, JTP.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.141
I'm once again ready
to sit upon my throne

02:21.228 --> 02:23.012
as your unstable leader.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.274
My first decree,

02:24.361 --> 02:27.016
we shall playeth Smashball.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.497
Ooh, we'd love to,
but it's crunch time
for college applications.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.020
Oh... Right.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.108
College.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.979
We are seniors,

02:34.066 --> 02:35.503
so that would be happening
right around now, wouldn't it?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.287
Dude, don't tell us
the whole Lainey thing

02:37.374 --> 02:39.115
distracted you
from applying to college.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.508
No!

02:40.595 --> 02:42.031
Don't be so stupid,
Matt Bradley!

02:42.118 --> 02:44.033
But I didn't even say...
Bup-bup-bup-bup!

02:44.120 --> 02:45.469
Just out of curiosity,

02:45.556 --> 02:48.342
tell me everything about
this application process

02:48.429 --> 02:50.082
so I know
you're doing it right.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.736
Well, we've really
been beefing up
our extra curriculars.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.042
Naked Rob
is an Eagle Scout.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.130
It's the highest level
of Boy Scout

02:54.217 --> 02:55.262
and the lowest level
of cop.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.915
Andy's a youth basketball
coach.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.613
Which is cool
'cause I'm taller
than all of 'em.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.049
And Matt Bradley's in
the Big Brother program.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.182
Jeremiah really
stole my heart.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.705
And I think also my car keys.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.446
And I'm the treasurer
for the Model UN.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.578
It's really stressful,
so all my armpit hair
fell out,

03:07.665 --> 03:09.276
but it'll all be worth it
if it impresses Dartmouth.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.452
It's good to see
we're all preparing.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.757
Therefore, there's
no reason to panic.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.586
Excuse me.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.288
I'm freaking out, man!

03:21.375 --> 03:23.159
Is that squirrel
taunting you again?

03:23.246 --> 03:25.030
Apparently,
I got so swept up in

03:25.117 --> 03:26.554
not getting married
to Lainey,

03:26.641 --> 03:28.338
I forgot about the whole
"getting into college" thing!

03:28.425 --> 03:30.427
Did you say "college"?
I heard "college."

03:30.514 --> 03:32.037
Don't screw this up, moron.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.169
Where did he come from?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.605
Dad, you gotta back off.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.128
I don't even know where
I want to go to school!

03:36.216 --> 03:37.391
That's where I can help.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.697
Okay, I need you
to focus up here,

03:39.784 --> 03:42.309
'cause picking a school
is not something
you just rush into.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.963
Done. I'm going
to Tufts.Moron!

03:45.050 --> 03:46.400
You don't just
open up a book

03:46.487 --> 03:47.531
and pick out
some random school

03:47.618 --> 03:48.837
and say,
"That's the one."

03:48.924 --> 03:50.404
But it just makes sense.
Why?

03:50.491 --> 03:52.754
'Cause its name is Tufts,

03:52.841 --> 03:55.235
and I'm basically
the toughest man
in the world.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.324
Tufts, fine, done.
Really?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.543
Hey, even if you got there
the dumbest way possible,

03:59.630 --> 04:01.241
Tufts is still
a great school,
so I'm good.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.591
So did we just decide
where I'm applying to college?

04:03.678 --> 04:06.071
My son's going to Tufts!
Hoo-hoo!

04:06.158 --> 04:08.683
ADULT ADAM: While Barry
was getting excited
about his dream college,

04:08.770 --> 04:11.207
my mom was just trying
to calm her nerves.

04:11.294 --> 04:14.036
I've been saying it
since the first time
I ran that stop sign,

04:14.123 --> 04:16.778
that intersection is
an accident waiting to happen,

04:16.865 --> 04:19.041
and it's high time
Mama fixes the problem!

04:19.128 --> 04:20.608
You could've been
seriously hurt!

04:20.695 --> 04:21.783
How?
I wasn't even there.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.220
But you could've been.
That's true.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.917
And, God forbid,
you could've gone through
the windshield

04:26.004 --> 04:27.571
like a delicious,
little sack of potatoes,

04:27.658 --> 04:29.878
and, God forbid,
a piece of glass

04:29.965 --> 04:31.706
could have lodged
in your brain!Oh, no!

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
Thank God the shard
got lodged

04:33.577 --> 04:34.622
in a place
where you're fine,

04:34.709 --> 04:36.667
and they don't
need to operate.Thank God.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.582
But, God forbid,
20 years from now,

04:38.669 --> 04:39.801
you could sneeze,
and boom!

04:39.888 --> 04:41.455
The shard shifts,
and you're a veggie.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.065
But I sneeze all the time!

04:43.152 --> 04:44.632
This is a parent's
worst nightmare,

04:44.719 --> 04:47.330
and it's all because
of a stupid stop sign!

04:47.417 --> 04:50.072
What's going on?
We're making the very
gut-wrenching decision

04:50.159 --> 04:52.074
about whether or not
Adam should have surgery

04:52.161 --> 04:54.381
to remove the glass
in his brain
from a car accident.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.339
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.472
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me clarify.
Adam's fine.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.474
We need another stop sign
at the end of the block.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.910
What?
Are you kidding me?

05:01.997 --> 05:03.390
I almost gave Adam a hug.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.044
I know, baby.
We're all scared,

05:06.131 --> 05:07.742
but Mama will fix this.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.614
I'm gonna take this case
to City Hall.

05:10.701 --> 05:11.441
I don't know
if you know this,

05:11.528 --> 05:12.747
but I could have been
a lawyer.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.140
I think you've said it
once or twice before.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.620
I could've been a lawyer.
I could've been a lawyer.

05:16.707 --> 05:17.839
I could've...
...been a lawyer.

05:17.926 --> 05:18.883
I could've...
...been a lawyer!

05:18.970 --> 05:20.189
I guess that rings a bell.
It should,

05:20.276 --> 05:21.451
'cause that bell
rings constantly.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.279
Well, as the lawyer
I could've been,

05:23.366 --> 05:26.326
I'm going to collect evidence
to support my case.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.631
Adam, I need you
to make a video

05:27.718 --> 05:29.416
documenting
how truly dangerous

05:29.503 --> 05:30.721
that intersection
really is.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.593
Yes!
I'll get right on it!

05:32.680 --> 05:34.290
Uh, what's my budget
for the project?

05:34.377 --> 05:35.987
Schmoo, can you just film
the intersection for me?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.685
Challenge accepted!
I won't let you down!

05:37.772 --> 05:39.817
As my mom was lawyering up,

05:39.904 --> 05:42.994
Barry and my dad
were getting down
to the business of college.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.475
Okay, let's go over what
you need to get into Tufts.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.911
Besides just being
super tough?

05:46.998 --> 05:48.522
Uh-huh.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.914
All right,
first, your grades.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.700
Oh, okay, you squeaked out
a B-minus in English.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.616
Wow! Straight A's
in math and science.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.532
All that math stuff
just clicks, but English
not good much.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.534
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna have to help
you with your essay.

06:00.621 --> 06:04.015
Or...
We freestyle my essay.
Check it out.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.235
♪ Yo, Tufts
I got the right stuffs

06:06.322 --> 06:08.672
♪ Yo, Tufts
I got the right stuffs

06:08.759 --> 06:11.066
♪ Yo, Tufts
I got the right stuffs ♪

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
You're just repeating
the same thing over and over.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.809
I got stuck in a rap loop.
I'm sorry!

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
Okay, that does not help.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.769
We really gotta wow 'em
with your extra curriculars.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.424
All right, let me
see your resume.Boom!

06:21.511 --> 06:24.558
All you wrote down
was "left-handed"
and that you're an Aries?

06:24.645 --> 06:26.211
That's not exactly
"boom" material.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.430
That's all I got.

06:27.517 --> 06:28.736
And technically,
I'm a Pisces,

06:28.823 --> 06:30.520
but I don't want to be
no stupid fish.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.435
Damn it!

06:32.522 --> 06:34.263
All you had to do
was play an instrument
or volunteer somewhere,

06:34.350 --> 06:35.743
and you did nothing!
I know!

06:35.830 --> 06:37.135
I'm not Tufts enough.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.789
Relax, moron.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.530
We'll just give your resume
a little padding.

06:40.617 --> 06:41.662
You mean lie?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.751
Think of it like
your mother's shoulder pads.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.056
She wears them

06:45.143 --> 06:47.015
even though she still has
shoulders, right?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.582
I bet she does.

06:48.669 --> 06:49.496
So you're telling me
you're okay

06:49.583 --> 06:50.845
with shoulder padding
my resume?

06:50.932 --> 06:53.717
I would do anything
to get you into college.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.066
Come on.
I'm serious.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.938
This is legitimately
the most important
thing to me.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.202
So you're telling me
you would spend
every cent you have

07:00.289 --> 07:02.639
if it would mean getting
me into a good college.Yes.

07:02.726 --> 07:05.250
What if you had to wear
pants at all times?Yes.

07:05.337 --> 07:09.037
What if the Eagles
never, ever won again?Yes.

07:09.124 --> 07:13.389
What if the only way
was for Tom Selleck
to shave his mustache?

07:13.476 --> 07:14.956
Too far!
You hear me?

07:15.043 --> 07:17.393
You leave Selleck's
mustache out of this!

07:17.480 --> 07:19.656
ADULT ADAM:
While my dad and Barry
were formulating a plan,

07:19.743 --> 07:21.963
my mom was putting
her plan into action.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.313
Hello, Mr. Schnitz.
I'm not sure you remember me.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.445
Oh, I remember you.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.707
You're the lady
that comes in here

07:26.794 --> 07:28.578
demanding I help you
because I'm city comptroller.

07:28.665 --> 07:29.753
Exactly.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.277
And things have gotten
out of comptrol.

07:32.364 --> 07:35.324
Again, I think you
gravely misunderstand

07:35.411 --> 07:36.804
the reach
the comptroller has.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.023
Well, if you can't comptrol
this city, then who can?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.634
You realize I am just
an accountant?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.462
And I am holding you
accountable.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.072
Just tell me
what you want.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.204
I'd like you
to take comptrol
of a traffic situation

07:46.291 --> 07:49.991
heretofore known as
Goldberg v. Jenkintown.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.776
Ma'am, this is just an office
above a tuxedo shop,

07:52.863 --> 07:54.430
not a court of law
where I can make any real...

07:54.517 --> 07:56.693
Exhibit A.
Okay, sure.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.303
This is the intersection
in question.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.480
Note that there are
only two stop signs,

08:00.567 --> 08:04.135
but by the time
I rest my case,
there will be four.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.876
Exhibit B.
Exactly how many
exhibits are there?

08:05.963 --> 08:09.053
Behold, a scale model
of our neighborhood.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.707
And please note Exhibit C.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.317
These are shards
of windshield

08:12.404 --> 08:14.885
that almost had to be removed
from my son's brain.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.147
Oh, my God,
that is horrib...

08:16.234 --> 08:17.453
We decided not to operate

08:17.540 --> 08:19.716
because he wasn't
actually in the car.What?

08:19.803 --> 08:21.892
Don't worry, he's fine
and super talented,

08:21.979 --> 08:24.286
which is why I tasked him
with Exhibit D.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.679
All rise.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.463
I really don't want to.
Overruled!

08:27.550 --> 08:28.943
Again, this is not a court...
You know what? Fine.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.161
Motion to get this
over with, then.

08:30.248 --> 08:30.945
You may be seated.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.252
ADAM: The year is 2033,

08:34.339 --> 08:37.734
crime is at an all time high and volcanoes are everywhere!

08:37.821 --> 08:39.170
BEVERLY: What is this?

08:39.257 --> 08:40.998
We agreed you were only
gonna film the stop signs.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.305
Trust me. You need to hook in
the audience with a story.

08:43.392 --> 08:47.135
The President's plane
has crash-landed
in Jenkintown.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.093
That's the forbidden sector.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.792
Only you can help us!

08:51.879 --> 08:53.097
Is that right,
what I'm saying?

08:53.184 --> 08:56.579
Even though I only have
one eye, I'll do it.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.015
I'll save the President.

08:59.669 --> 09:02.324
It's go time.
Nothing will stop me!

09:05.327 --> 09:08.591
POPS: The President blew up
before Snake could get to him.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.637
The mission has failed.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.726
I'm re... I'm really
not following the story...

09:12.813 --> 09:13.901
ADAM: We need a stop sign.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.250
Okay.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.557
Well,
I did not understand
any of that,

09:17.644 --> 09:19.602
but I really would like you
not to be here,

09:19.689 --> 09:21.299
so I'm gonna give you
that stop sign.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.127
So... I won the case?

09:23.214 --> 09:24.694
You took comptrol
of the courtroom.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.304
Which is my office,
so, yeah, sure.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.045
Great!

09:28.132 --> 09:29.960
So just, uh, bang the gavel
and make it official.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.396
Well, I don't have a ga...
You know what?

09:31.483 --> 09:32.484
Let me just do
this Fanta can.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.921
Ah!

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618
We won the big case!

09:35.705 --> 09:37.011
Amazing!

09:37.098 --> 09:38.229
How did I play?

09:38.316 --> 09:41.058
Not great,
but Mom was on fire.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.366
I gotta admit,
even if the whole thing
is aggressively pointless,

09:44.453 --> 09:45.976
it's kind of cool
you actually
made a difference.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.891
You know, this is really
important to me,

09:47.978 --> 09:50.154
and I am damn tired
of your sass mouth!

09:50.241 --> 09:51.242
No sass.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.680
I know how hard it is
to get things done.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.899
I mean, I've been
working on one song
for the last three months,

09:55.986 --> 09:57.553
and so far,
all I've got is...

09:57.640 --> 09:58.772
♪ Something,
something, something

09:58.859 --> 10:00.382
♪ And your friend Andre ♪

10:00.469 --> 10:01.775
And that is not good.

10:01.862 --> 10:02.558
I mean,
who the hell is Andre?

10:02.645 --> 10:03.994
I think it's catchy.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.779
Point is,
I'm proud of you.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.432
Oh, thank you, Boopie,
and you know what?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.173
I've made a decision.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.612
I am going to realize
my potential
as a potential lawyer.

10:12.699 --> 10:13.743
Oh, my God,
are you serious?

10:13.830 --> 10:15.527
You're damn right I am!

10:15.615 --> 10:19.880
Beverly Goldberg's
gonna be a  lawyer!

10:19.967 --> 10:22.796
ADULT ADAM: Once my dad found out Barry's college resume was light,

10:22.883 --> 10:24.711
he made it his mission
to bulk it up.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.582
The trick is
to take a nugget of truth,

10:26.669 --> 10:28.192
and you spin it a little.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.716
You do play
a lot of sports, right?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.674
Hockey,
wrestling, football.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.241
Moron, if you played
a bunch of sports,

10:33.328 --> 10:35.417
why aren't any of them
on your college resume?

10:35.504 --> 10:39.247
A variety of reasons,
but mostly 'cause of
unsuccessful tryouts.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.466
So you played all three
for a little bit,

10:41.553 --> 10:43.817
so you're at least
a three-letter
varsity player,

10:43.904 --> 10:45.775
and an MVP.

10:45.862 --> 10:46.907
I never won MVP.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.735
You never won
Most Valuable Player,

10:48.822 --> 10:50.867
but "MVP"
could stand for anything.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.652
Like Magic Velvet Pants?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.610
Who wins Magic Velvet Pants?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.003
I don't know. A genie?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.744
Should we put down
that I'm a genie, too?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.571
Let's move on.
So we covered sports.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.443
What about community service?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.271
I guess I am
in the community

11:03.358 --> 11:05.012
when I'm walking around
the community.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.492
Wow, sounds like
you're the head of
a neighborhood watch.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.060
And I do shout
at dogs sometimes.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.106
Seems to me
that you train
service animals.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.498
I think I'm getting
the hang of this,

11:13.585 --> 11:15.979
like that one time I played
checkers with Pops.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.460
I was basically volunteering
with sad, old veterans.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.636
Perfect, throw more at me!

11:20.723 --> 11:22.551
ADULT ADAM: And with that,
my dad spun
all of my brother's antics

11:22.638 --> 11:23.683
into resume gold.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.075
His bad BMX-ing became...

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
School cycling team.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.123
Goofing off
in the gymnasium became...Gymnast!

11:29.210 --> 11:31.038
Trying to eat an apple
in one bite became...

11:31.125 --> 11:33.083
Head of
the Isaac Newton Society.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.519
Doing whatever this is
became...

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
Gravity experiments
elective.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.567
Just walking became...
Hall monitor!

11:38.654 --> 11:40.700
His lifelong obsession
withDonkey Kong became...

11:40.787 --> 11:43.398
Unpaid assistant
to a primate physician.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.313
And dressing as
a pirate became...Pirate!

11:45.400 --> 11:48.316
Wow, I've led
an incredibly rich life.

11:48.403 --> 11:49.752
You're damn right you have.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.015
Hoo-hoo!
I'm a good dad!

11:52.102 --> 11:53.974
ADULT ADAM: While my dad
was feeling confident about
Barry's future,

11:54.061 --> 11:55.932
my mom was getting ready
to change hers.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.282
Good morning,
your honorable smush bottom!

11:58.369 --> 11:59.631
Looking good, Mom!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.459
That's because today
is the first day

12:01.546 --> 12:03.766
of your mama bear's journey
to becoming a trial lawyer.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.159
Well, I know
you can do it.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.508
I mean, who's better
at arguing than you?

12:06.595 --> 12:08.510
Well, I did get this suit
at half price

12:08.597 --> 12:10.077
because of a smudge
on the shoulder,

12:10.164 --> 12:12.122
which I put there
and later removed.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.994
And those are the kind
of questionable morals

12:14.081 --> 12:16.344
that will make you
an ace attorney. Thank you.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.607
Okay, so here's what it takes
to become a lawyer.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.827
First, you'll have
to get ready for the LSATs.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.916
Well,
I can LSAT or L-stand.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.787
I can do it all.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.181
Seriously, what is that?

12:27.268 --> 12:28.748
It's the
Law School Admissions Test,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.272
which takes about four months
to prepare for.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.840
And after that,
you apply to law school,
which is three years.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.059
Even for a proven
legal eagle like me?

12:36.146 --> 12:37.495
I mean, I could've been
a lawyer.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.627
That's got to count
for something.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.716
It doesn't. Moving on.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.849
So after you graduate,
you'll have to pass the bar.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.503
Another test?
I just took the "L" one.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.679
And then you'll get hired
at a firm and be an associate

12:47.767 --> 12:49.159
and work your way
up the ladder until...

12:49.246 --> 12:51.205
Eh, Mama's out.
What?

12:51.292 --> 12:53.773
I-I think I'm okay
just knowing I could
have been a lawyer.

12:53.860 --> 12:54.948
How can you possibly
know that

12:55.035 --> 12:56.776
if you gave up
after two minutes?

12:56.863 --> 12:57.864
Well,
when you think about it,

12:57.951 --> 12:59.648
I already
kind of am a lawyer.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.258
Except
you're not a lawyer,

13:01.345 --> 13:02.651
because you did nothing
to become one.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.958
According to the show
L.A. Law,

13:05.045 --> 13:07.612
anyone can represent
themselves in court,

13:07.699 --> 13:09.266
so that kind of
makes me a lawyer.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.182
No, it makes you a person
who wants to be a lawyer
but isn't one.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.054
If I can defend myself
in court,

13:14.141 --> 13:17.187
then you can,
Daddy can, anyone can.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.972
So when you think about it,

13:19.059 --> 13:20.843
doesn't that make us
all lawyers?

13:20.930 --> 13:23.019
That is an
incredibly dumb way
to think about it.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.368
Hey, I could've been
a lawyer,

13:24.455 --> 13:26.414
so you show me the respect
I could've deserved.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.939
Read it and weep,
suckers.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.375
What's this?
Oh.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.769
Just the best college resume
ever assembled.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.424
Three-letter varsity athlete?
Captain of the diving team?

13:36.511 --> 13:37.686
Geology club?

13:37.773 --> 13:39.383
Dude, you didn't do
any of these things.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.168
It says you're the treasurer
of the Model UN?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.823
I once gave the foreign kid
who smells like beets

13:43.910 --> 13:45.346
a quarter to buy a donut,

13:45.433 --> 13:46.651
so that pretty much
makes me

13:46.738 --> 13:48.392
official treasurer
of the Model UN.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.916
Except you're not
'cause I am!

13:50.003 --> 13:52.135
In the name of Luxembourg,
I declare war on your lies!

13:52.222 --> 13:54.268
We don't have a real army,
so it's more of
a symbolic gesture.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.052
Guys, relax.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.054
It's not like
I'm hurting anyone.Yes, you are!

13:58.141 --> 14:00.187
What if your lies get you
into a school over one of us?

14:00.274 --> 14:01.623
Is that fair?
Okay.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.452
You're clearly feeling
a lot of emotions right now,

14:04.539 --> 14:06.846
which I can help you with
'cause I'm a peer counselor

14:06.933 --> 14:08.412
and a certified
youth minister.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.066
This is super not cool
or chill, man.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.720
Oh, come on,
Matt Bradley!

14:11.807 --> 14:13.287
Where did that come from?

14:13.374 --> 14:14.636
Come on, guys!

14:14.723 --> 14:16.159
JTP...
JTP!

14:16.246 --> 14:17.682
J...

14:17.769 --> 14:19.380
...TP.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.860
ADULT ADAM: While Barry
was feeling guilty

14:20.947 --> 14:22.470
about achieving
his college dreams,

14:22.557 --> 14:25.168
Erica was hell-bent on getting my mom to reach for hers.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.388
There she is,
ready to fold
my intimates.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.129
Put down the basket.
We need to talk.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.522
Erica, it's fine.
I don't need to be
a real lawyer.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.481
Okay, forget law,

14:33.568 --> 14:35.439
but there's
so many other things
that you're good at,

14:35.526 --> 14:37.354
so let's pick one of those
and make it your thing.

14:37.441 --> 14:38.660
Okay, like what?

14:38.747 --> 14:41.141
I'm glad you asked,
because I made this...

14:41.228 --> 14:42.925
A list of
potential dream jobs

14:43.012 --> 14:44.405
tailored
to your very talents.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.233
For instance, diplomat.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.583
Well, I do have a way
of helping people

14:48.670 --> 14:51.151
to get what I want them
to think they want.Exactly.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.980
And that's just one
of many exciting options.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.285
What about
fashion designer?

14:55.372 --> 14:57.635
Mmm, my clothes
are purely for fun.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.550
I don't want to take
the joy out of it.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.118
Or you could be
a gastroenterologist.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.078
Speaking of which,
how did that fiber-rich
breakfast work out, hmm?

15:05.165 --> 15:07.558
Gah, I have so many futures
for you on this board.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.386
Just pick one and do it!

15:09.473 --> 15:11.998
Enough.
I'm fine just doing
what I do, okay?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.608
I don't need
some fancy job.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.914
Yes, you do!

15:15.001 --> 15:16.480
Because if you give up
on being a lawyer,

15:16.567 --> 15:18.700
which is actually doable,

15:18.787 --> 15:21.094
then what does that
mean for me making it
as a musician?

15:21.181 --> 15:22.922
Erica, me saying
"I could've been a lawyer"

15:23.009 --> 15:24.140
has nothing to do with you.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.881
Of course it does!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
I dropped out of college
just like you,

15:28.057 --> 15:29.493
which means
I'll just end up being a mom

15:29.580 --> 15:31.147
who constantly tells
her ungrateful kids

15:31.234 --> 15:32.757
that "I could've been
a rock star."

15:32.844 --> 15:34.759
I don't know whether to be
offended or worried,

15:34.846 --> 15:36.065
but I don't like
either feeling.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.458
But it's true.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.416
Becoming a lawyer is hard,

15:39.503 --> 15:42.506
and you gave up on it,
like, shockingly fast.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.508
And the truth is...

15:44.595 --> 15:46.510
I'm doing the same thing
with my music.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.382
Ever since Lainey left...

15:48.469 --> 15:50.253
I haven't
sung a single note

15:50.340 --> 15:51.689
or written any music

15:51.776 --> 15:53.604
or even touched my keyboard.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.563
Schmoo, you've got it
all wrong.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.261
I gave up on being a lawyer
'cause that was never
really my dream.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.828
Then why do you
always say it?

15:59.915 --> 16:02.222
'Cause it sounds better
than my real dream,

16:02.309 --> 16:04.093
which is being a mama.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.313
I'm living my dream.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.924
If music is yours,
you can't just give up on it.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.188
I already have.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.367
ADULT ADAM: After my brother
talked to the JTP,

16:17.454 --> 16:19.543
he was starting to have some
doubts about his resume.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.937
Unfortunately,
my dad had none.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.853
Dad, I just finished
my college essay,

16:24.940 --> 16:26.420
and I think we should
have a little talk.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.292
Oh, you should have a talk,
but not with me.Huh?

16:29.379 --> 16:30.467
I've got an alumnus
from Tufts here,

16:30.554 --> 16:31.816
and he's gonna
interview you.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.383
Remember my pal
Formica Mike?

16:33.470 --> 16:34.863
Your furniture nemesis?

16:34.950 --> 16:37.257
I got his mom a great deal
on a water bed,

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
so he owes me.
But...

16:38.867 --> 16:41.174
The JTP got me thinking,

16:41.261 --> 16:43.263
maybe shoulder-padding
my resume...

16:43.350 --> 16:44.742
...isn't the most
honest thing.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.614
I don't care
what the PYT thinks.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.746
You go in there and lie
and make your dad proud.
Come on.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.357
Here he is...

16:50.444 --> 16:53.055
The future of Tufts!

16:53.142 --> 16:55.840
Murray, you may be right,
if this resume
is to be believed.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.191
And it is!
I'm gonna get you guys
some cookies.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.844
Hydrox, if you got 'em!

16:59.931 --> 17:02.325
Hydrox is the Oreo
of our people.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.675
Uh-huh.
Listen, about my resume...

17:04.762 --> 17:06.199
Oh, your resume, my gosh.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.070
This is something special.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.811
How does one person
find the time?

17:09.898 --> 17:13.162
"How does one person
do all that stuff
in one year," you ask?

17:13.249 --> 17:15.686
Well... Don't.
Don't ask.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.036
Okay.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.038
Wow, there's so much here.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.997
Uh, you're an
"unpaid assistant
to a primate physician."

17:22.084 --> 17:23.303
W... Well, I love monkeys,

17:23.390 --> 17:24.782
so what's it like
to work with them?

17:24.869 --> 17:25.653
It's good.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.310
Care to elaborate?

17:30.397 --> 17:33.182
Uh, they love
throwing barrels and stuff.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.879
Barrels?
Yeah, it's annoying,

17:34.966 --> 17:36.533
'cause you just got to save
your girlfriend

17:36.620 --> 17:38.361
and then jump over
rolling barrels,

17:38.448 --> 17:40.189
but luckily,
they break apart

17:40.276 --> 17:42.800
when you whack 'em
with a mallet.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.585
We're talking
about Donkey Kong,
aren't we?

17:44.672 --> 17:46.326
Yes!  I'm sorry.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.067
It's a lie, all of it!

17:48.154 --> 17:50.025
I-I don't deserve
to be in Tufts.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.940
He doesn't mean it.
He's just being a moron.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.725
I do mean it.
So no Hydrox?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.510
Look, I'm sorry I messed up
my whole senior year

17:56.597 --> 17:58.381
and focused on
the wrong things,

17:58.468 --> 18:00.209
but I won't lie my way
into college.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.689
I was promised Hydrox.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.170
That's why I wanted you
to read my essay.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.824
It's not pretty,
but it's real.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.435
It's about what really
happened this year, and...

18:10.045 --> 18:11.438
If the truth isn't
good enough for Tufts,

18:11.525 --> 18:14.093
then I'll just
have to live with it.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.536
Whoa, what's all this?

18:22.623 --> 18:25.278
I figured it was time
to pursue a new dream.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.714
I thought you said
being a mom was your dream.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.933
And it is.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.457
But you were right.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.676
What kind of example
would I be setting

18:32.763 --> 18:34.939
if I just gave up
on all my other dreams?

18:35.026 --> 18:36.550
These are just recipes.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.247
I've decided
to write a cookbook.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.989
Oh, my God, yes!

18:41.076 --> 18:44.210
I pitched you diplomat
and not cookbook?
What is wrong with me?

18:44.297 --> 18:47.126
Nothing!
You still got me here!

18:47.213 --> 18:48.518
So, thank you, Boopie.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.346
No need to thank me.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.131
It's just good to know your
dreams don't end with me.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.349
And even better?

18:53.436 --> 18:55.308
Your dreams
are just starting,

18:55.395 --> 18:57.832
and there's no way
I'm gonna let you give up
before you even begin.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.966
I just picked
an impossible dream,
you know?

19:02.053 --> 19:03.925
Schmoopie...

19:04.012 --> 19:06.188
All dreams seem impossible.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.755
You've just got to
put in the work.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.017
ADULT ADAM:
Seeing that our mom

19:09.104 --> 19:11.019
wasn't afraid
to follow her dreams

19:11.106 --> 19:13.369
made Erica realize
that her own dreams
weren't so scary.

19:13.456 --> 19:16.416
And with that,
my sister was able
to find her voice again.

Let me guess.
I'm a moron
for telling the truth.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.235
You really are,
but I loved it anyway.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.455
Seriously?
Yeah. It moved me.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.805
Why?

19:57.892 --> 19:59.981
All I did was talk about
getting my heart shattered

20:00.068 --> 20:01.548
and how this year
was a total waste.

20:01.635 --> 20:04.507
Barry, what you wrote
was honest and real,

20:04.594 --> 20:06.770
and it shows how much
you've grown,

20:06.857 --> 20:08.816
and that's more important
than anything

20:08.903 --> 20:11.297
you can put on some stupid
college resume.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.299
Important enough
to get me into Tufts?

20:13.386 --> 20:16.171
You know, I think it's time
we stop worrying
about all that stuff.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.392
But I know college
is the only thing
you care about.

20:19.479 --> 20:23.309
You know, there's one thing
I care about more... You.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.136

Good news is you got us
that new stop sign.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.886
Wasn't easy, you know.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.454

Add master of all cubes

21:06.134 --> 21:07.396
I never thought
I'd say these words,

21:07.483 --> 21:09.355
but I'm
incredibly impressed.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.574
Dude, it's easy.
I just bought
a bunch of other cubes

21:11.661 --> 21:13.054
and peeled off
the stickers.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.491
Oh, so you cheated.
Of course I did!

21:15.578 --> 21:17.450
You suck, Mr. Rubik!

21:17.537 --> 21:20.061
I cannot wait 'til everyone
forgets about you
and your stupid toy.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.585
Mark my words,
that toy
is more than a fad.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.935
Rubik and his cube
will be here forever.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.502
I get the appeal now.
