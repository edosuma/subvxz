WEBVTT

00:06.362 --> 00:07.695
Morning, Baker.

00:07.697 --> 00:08.964
Morning, sir.
How are you feeling?

00:08.966 --> 00:10.298
Better. Thank you.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.716
There's a decision to be made.

00:11.718 --> 00:13.168
I'm afraid there is.

00:13.170 --> 00:14.336
Detective Reagan

00:14.338 --> 00:16.638
and Officer Reagan are both
scheduled to work today.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.090
You asked me not
to request changes.

00:19.092 --> 00:20.892
So you didn't. Good.

00:20.894 --> 00:22.560
A.D.A. Reagan has a deposition.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.729
Wheels of justice have to turn.

00:24.731 --> 00:29.100
Yes, sir. CompStat's scheduled
to end at 1300 hours,

00:29.102 --> 00:30.685
and your subsequent meeting
with the mayor

00:30.687 --> 00:31.686
has been postponed, again.

00:31.688 --> 00:32.720
Who postponed last time?

00:32.722 --> 00:34.155
The mayor did, sir.

00:34.157 --> 00:35.273
Last two times.

00:35.275 --> 00:37.092
But you instructed me
not to push back

00:37.094 --> 00:38.743
in the absence
of a burning issue.

00:38.745 --> 00:40.195
And you couldn't find one?

00:40.197 --> 00:41.279
Try as I might.

00:41.281 --> 00:42.831
What about
our former commissioner?

00:42.833 --> 00:44.532
Under the weather, conveniently.

00:44.534 --> 00:45.667
You're the
police commissioner.

00:45.669 --> 00:47.085
You can always have an excuse.

00:47.087 --> 00:49.421
It would have to be
an honest one in this instance,

00:49.423 --> 00:51.006
and we don't have that.

00:51.891 --> 00:53.008
In summation.

00:53.010 --> 00:54.575
You're clear to serve
as a chaperone

00:54.577 --> 00:55.844
on your grandson's field trip.

00:55.846 --> 00:58.579
(sighs)
Okay.

00:58.581 --> 01:00.348
Sir, if I may?

01:00.350 --> 01:01.833
On the bright side,

01:01.835 --> 01:03.635
some alone time
with your grandson.

01:03.637 --> 01:06.938
It's not exactly alone time when
there are 30 other ten-year-olds

01:06.940 --> 01:08.973
to be roped and corralled.

01:08.975 --> 01:11.226
Good point.

01:13.446 --> 01:15.763
(groans)

01:17.066 --> 01:18.700
Hey, Sarge, where's Baez?

01:18.702 --> 01:20.101
I brought her favorite coffee.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.954
That organic, free-trade,
single-bean, low-acid stuff?

01:22.956 --> 01:25.140
Yeah, kind of tastes like motor oil.
She had a court appearance today,

01:25.142 --> 01:27.292
testifying on
one of her old cases,

01:27.294 --> 01:30.045
which means you're parked
at your desk.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.963
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm good at flying solo, sir.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.631
No, no, no, no,

01:33.633 --> 01:35.667
not when you owe me
a month's worth of DD-5s.

01:35.669 --> 01:37.385
What are you talking about?
Says who?

01:37.387 --> 01:41.389
Says me, after I saw you
dumping your unfinished ones

01:41.391 --> 01:43.624
over on Slattery's desk.

01:43.626 --> 01:45.143
(laughter)

01:45.794 --> 01:48.313
There you go. And...

01:49.448 --> 01:51.149
...enjoy your motor oil.

01:55.955 --> 01:58.406
(shivers) This weather
is ridiculous.

01:58.408 --> 02:01.025
Crazy as this is, it's supposed
to blow over by about noon.

02:01.027 --> 02:03.361
(chuckles)
Speaking of crazies,

02:03.363 --> 02:06.030
do you remember that
guy covered in blood

02:06.032 --> 02:09.084
we caught a couple months
ago on 46th Street?

02:09.086 --> 02:11.503
Knife in hand, tried to
convince us he was a chef?

02:11.505 --> 02:13.088
(laughs):
Yes.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.990
I ran into the detective
that we handed him off to.

02:15.992 --> 02:20.011
Said he tied that dumb-ass
to four homicides.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.829
Eh, like we couldn't
have done that.

02:21.831 --> 02:23.214
You know?
Yeah.

02:23.216 --> 02:25.100
Oh, hey, are you jealous?

02:25.102 --> 02:26.801
Oh, no, I'm just tired
of everyone else

02:26.803 --> 02:28.136
getting to solve the puzzle,
you know?

02:28.138 --> 02:30.305
Most we get to do
is take it out of the box

02:30.307 --> 02:31.890
and put a few
of the edge pieces together.

02:31.892 --> 02:33.608
Yeah.

02:35.227 --> 02:36.478
(shivers)

02:36.480 --> 02:37.512
JAMIE:
Wow.

02:37.514 --> 02:39.114
Now, that is sweet.

02:39.116 --> 02:41.449
It's called an ass.
Lots of girls have them.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.318
Uh, I meant the bike.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.319
JANKO:
Trust me,

02:44.321 --> 02:46.354
he really did.

02:46.356 --> 02:47.789
Kidding.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.374
Do you race?

02:49.376 --> 02:50.492
Just through traffic.

02:50.494 --> 02:52.026
I'm a bike messenger.

02:52.028 --> 02:53.461
I work for Blaze Couriers.

02:53.463 --> 02:54.996
Must pay well.

02:54.998 --> 02:57.415
It'd take me a lot of overtime
to afford a bike like that.

02:58.417 --> 02:59.634
And for you, miss?
Just a water, please.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.069
Water.

03:04.173 --> 03:05.807
All you got is a 50?

03:05.809 --> 03:07.142
That or 100.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.178
Anyway, I'm Maya.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.647
Jamie. This is Officer Janko.

03:12.649 --> 03:15.099
You got something
I can write on, Jamie?

03:15.985 --> 03:17.385
Yeah, just this.

03:17.387 --> 03:19.237
Hold this.

03:26.662 --> 03:29.747
Call me if you, you know,
want a ride.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:39.008 --> 03:40.375
Way to go, Reagan.

03:40.377 --> 03:43.261
You got yourself a number with
virtually no help from me.

03:43.263 --> 03:44.745
Hey, who says I need your help?

03:44.747 --> 03:46.798
I tell Jamie
since he's a rookie,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.267
find a nice girl,
give her a ring.

03:49.269 --> 03:50.385
Baby steps, Stavros.

03:50.387 --> 03:51.752
We got to get this guy
a girlfriend first.

03:51.754 --> 03:53.638
All right,
can we just order, please?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.441
Two whole grain bagels,
one mocha, one juice coming up.

03:58.277 --> 04:00.228
(phone ringing)

04:00.230 --> 04:01.729
5-4 Squad.

04:01.731 --> 04:03.398
WOMAN: Let me talk
to Detective Kilbane.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.818
Detective Kilbane hasn't sat
at this desk since 2009.

04:06.820 --> 04:07.952
Do you have a forwarding number?

04:07.954 --> 04:10.822
Actually, Detective Kilbane
retired a year ago

04:10.824 --> 04:12.991
and he died a few months later,
sorry.

04:12.993 --> 04:14.909
Thank God for small mercies.

04:14.911 --> 04:16.777
This is Detective Reagan.

04:16.779 --> 04:17.995
Something I can help you with?

04:17.998 --> 04:20.298
Listen to me, I only called
to talk to Kilbane,

04:20.300 --> 04:22.283
but I'm happy to tell you, too,

04:22.285 --> 04:24.919
that your precinct, the NYPD,

04:24.921 --> 04:27.589
your whole system failed,

04:27.591 --> 04:30.375
and I'm gonna make sure
the whole world knows.

04:30.377 --> 04:32.627
And how do you plan on
doing that?

04:32.629 --> 04:34.679
Once I kill myself,

04:34.681 --> 04:37.131
they'll know.

Why don't you tell me your name?

It's Jill.

05:21.602 --> 05:22.767
Jill what?

05:22.769 --> 05:24.002
It doesn't matter.

05:24.004 --> 05:25.387
It does matter, Jill.
What's your last name?

05:25.389 --> 05:26.755
What are you gonna do
if I tell you?

05:26.757 --> 05:29.608
You gonna suck at your job

05:29.610 --> 05:31.259
I'm gonna grab a pen
and-and some paper

05:31.261 --> 05:33.345
and I'm gonna take down
some information,

05:33.347 --> 05:35.764
and I'm gonna talk to you and
listen to what you have to say.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.433
Okay, you go grab
your imaginary pen.

05:38.435 --> 05:40.068
I'm trying
to help you here, okay?

05:40.070 --> 05:41.436
Except that you are the problem.

05:41.438 --> 05:42.737
I'm the problem?

05:42.739 --> 05:44.272
Usually people got
to meet me first

05:44.274 --> 05:45.624
before they figure
that part out.

05:45.626 --> 05:49.027
No, I mean you-- cops, lawyers,
judges, all of you.

05:49.029 --> 05:51.696
And you think threatening
to kill yourself is gonna help?

05:51.698 --> 05:52.914
Listen, Detective,

05:52.916 --> 05:54.065
it's not a threat.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.700
Look, why don't you
just talk to me?

05:55.702 --> 05:57.402
All right?
Give me a chance to show you

05:57.404 --> 05:59.571
that I'm better than the other
cops you spoke to, all right?

05:59.573 --> 06:00.455
What's going on?

06:00.457 --> 06:02.123
(quietly):
A girl called for Kilbane

06:02.125 --> 06:03.458
threatening to off herself.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.909
So send her to the hotline.

06:04.911 --> 06:05.977
Who are you talking to?

06:05.979 --> 06:07.579
Jill, take it easy, all right?

06:07.581 --> 06:08.680
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

06:08.682 --> 06:10.582
I'm talking to
my pain-in-the-ass boss.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.384
See, I got problems, too,
all right?

06:12.386 --> 06:14.152
Sarge, Jill called

06:14.154 --> 06:16.688
saying that Kilbane and the 5-4
and the system failed her

06:16.690 --> 06:18.139
and she wants to kill herself.

06:18.141 --> 06:20.191
And you're the guy that's gonna
keep her alive?

06:20.193 --> 06:21.526
I'm the one on the phone
with her.

06:21.528 --> 06:23.395
Bedside manner isn't your forte.

06:23.397 --> 06:24.613
Well, pardon me.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.531
(whispers): Get TARU down here
to pinpoint her location

06:26.533 --> 06:28.033
and get me
somewhere quiet to talk.

06:28.035 --> 06:29.484
Jill, are you there?

06:29.486 --> 06:32.404
Not for long.

06:33.873 --> 06:36.324
This is Stavros
from coffee shop.

06:36.326 --> 06:37.709
Hey, Stavros, what's up?

06:37.711 --> 06:39.744
I'm victim of a crime.

06:39.746 --> 06:42.464
Counterfeit $50 bill.

06:42.466 --> 06:43.748
From that girl
in front of us today?

06:43.750 --> 06:44.833
Yes, the girl on the bike.

06:44.835 --> 06:46.251
You're police, so I call you.

06:46.253 --> 06:47.469
No, you did the right thing,
Stavros.

06:47.471 --> 06:49.337
Do me a favor,
hold on to that bill, okay?

06:49.339 --> 06:50.589
All right, thank you.

06:50.591 --> 06:52.290
Hey, what's up?

06:52.292 --> 06:54.509
Uh, Maya today gave Stavros
a fake 50.

06:54.511 --> 06:57.512
So the future Mrs. Jamie Reagan
is a crook.

06:57.514 --> 06:59.797
Like you know where every bill
that you have came from?

06:59.799 --> 07:01.266
Aw.

07:01.268 --> 07:03.234
Her white knight.

07:03.236 --> 07:05.320
I'm just saying, she could've
picked it up making a delivery.

07:05.322 --> 07:06.905
Well, you got her number, right?

07:06.907 --> 07:08.306
Perfect reason to call her.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.991
(scoffs)

07:09.993 --> 07:11.610
It is, huh?

07:15.281 --> 07:17.082
No! Put that on speakerphone.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.869
(line ringing)

07:20.871 --> 07:22.704
(man speaking Japanese

07:29.061 --> 07:30.962
(phone beeps)

07:30.964 --> 07:32.997
She gave me a fake number.

07:32.999 --> 07:36.701
Or, you know, maybe she runs
a sushi joint in her spare time.

07:36.703 --> 07:38.053
So, what do you
want to do?

07:38.055 --> 07:39.654
You want to go
after that fake 50?

07:39.656 --> 07:41.489
No.

07:41.491 --> 07:43.007
First, we find Maya.

07:43.009 --> 07:45.677
What? Maya?
She's riding all around town.

07:45.679 --> 07:47.646
Yeah, well Blaze Courier
is over on 53rd.

07:47.648 --> 07:49.814
They'll know where she is.
Come on, shorty.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.701
JILL:
<i>You cops think</i>

07:52.703 --> 07:53.952
you're so smart.

07:53.954 --> 07:55.570
Do you even realize
how you ruin people's lives

07:55.572 --> 07:56.788
with your promises?

07:56.790 --> 07:59.908
Well, who promised you
something? Detective Kilbane?

07:59.910 --> 08:01.626
Yeah, him, everyone,
and my life

08:01.628 --> 08:03.378
still went to crap.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.196
Okay, well, I'm not him.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.414
Yeah, you could've fooled me.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.199
Same smug voice.

08:08.201 --> 08:09.668
You know, you're not exactly

08:09.670 --> 08:11.970
Miss Sunshine yourself,
are you there, Jill?

08:11.972 --> 08:14.673
So maybe you and I have
something in common after all.

08:16.475 --> 08:17.709
Did you hear that?

08:17.711 --> 08:19.177
That is the gun

08:19.179 --> 08:21.146
that I'm gonna kill myself with.

08:21.148 --> 08:23.481
And when I do, my blood

08:23.483 --> 08:25.083
is gonna be on you.

08:25.085 --> 08:27.218
GORMLEY:
Reagan?

08:27.220 --> 08:28.853
You sure this isn't a prank?

08:28.855 --> 08:30.321
Some sad sack

08:30.323 --> 08:33.323
frequent flyer looking for a new
cop to hang her problems on?

08:33.326 --> 08:35.409
She's serious, Sarge.

08:35.412 --> 08:37.495
There's something else going on
with her, but she's serious.

08:37.496 --> 08:40.198
Okay, well, I got TARU

08:40.200 --> 08:43.034
and a phone set up
for you in the box.

08:43.035 --> 08:46.838
Okay. Jill, I want you to hold
on just for one second, okay?

08:46.840 --> 08:48.123
I'm gonna, uh,
go somewhere quieter

08:48.125 --> 08:49.591
where you and I can talk
without interruptions.

08:49.593 --> 08:50.625
Yeah, okay.

08:50.627 --> 08:52.627
Then everyone can eavesdrop.

08:52.629 --> 08:53.762
Well, look,
here's the good news.

08:53.764 --> 08:54.929
These phones are so crappy here,

08:54.931 --> 08:56.181
if anyone else gets on the line,

08:56.183 --> 08:58.216
you'll hear it from the static
or the clicky...

08:58.218 --> 08:59.884
echo-y voices.

08:59.886 --> 09:01.436
Listen, just hang on, okay?

09:01.438 --> 09:03.138
Good-bye, Detective.
, listen.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.473
You said you wanted to talk,
you wanted someone to listen.

09:05.475 --> 09:06.691
Well, now's your chance.

09:06.693 --> 09:08.092
Don't hang up.

09:10.279 --> 09:12.397
You able to locate her?

09:12.399 --> 09:14.115
Working on it.
Putting her on speaker.

09:14.117 --> 09:15.650
(phone beeps)
Jill, are you there?

09:15.652 --> 09:17.435
Jill?

09:17.437 --> 09:18.570
Yeah, I'm here.

09:18.572 --> 09:19.704
Okay.

09:19.706 --> 09:22.290
Look, let's talk
about Kilbane,

09:22.292 --> 09:24.776
because obviously you're upset
about one of his cases,

09:24.778 --> 09:26.244
and I'm assuming
it involved you.

09:26.246 --> 09:29.798
You a victim
or did he put you away?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.516
Neither.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.001
Family member?

09:33.003 --> 09:34.419
Yeah.

09:34.421 --> 09:36.054
My parents were murdered.

09:36.056 --> 09:37.806
Are you happy now?

09:37.808 --> 09:40.458
No, I'm not happy.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.677
Actually, I'm sorry.

09:42.679 --> 09:44.462
(beeping)
Number's a no-name

09:44.464 --> 09:45.730
prepaid cell.
I can't even reach

09:45.732 --> 09:47.217
the carrier to have
them ping it for us.

09:47.218 --> 09:48.779
Keep trying.
Maybe they can triangulate.

09:48.819 --> 09:50.401
What was that beep?

09:51.987 --> 09:54.272
I told you I'm not gonna lie
to you, Jill.

09:54.274 --> 09:56.157
It was me
unable to pinpoint

09:56.159 --> 09:57.992
your location.

09:57.994 --> 09:59.994
Yeah, well, of course you can't,

09:59.996 --> 10:02.947
because I am smarter than you.

10:02.949 --> 10:03.998
I guess you are.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.083
(phone beeps)
Grab Kilbane's files.

10:05.085 --> 10:06.167
We got to figure out
what case this is.

10:06.169 --> 10:07.535
(phone beeps)

10:07.537 --> 10:09.537
Look, I want you to know
I'm very sorry

10:09.539 --> 10:10.922
for your loss, Jill.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.040
Look...

10:13.425 --> 10:15.043
I lost my mother
a few years ago,

10:15.045 --> 10:17.095
and I had a brother
who was murdered, too, so...

10:17.097 --> 10:20.715
maybe I can kind of relate
to what you're going through.

10:22.268 --> 10:24.435
You know, they say
it gets easier...

10:26.472 --> 10:28.606
But it only gets worse.

10:35.781 --> 10:37.315
Oh, there they come.

10:37.317 --> 10:38.867
(children chattering)

10:38.869 --> 10:40.618
Keep those lines straight.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.906
Okay, pause right here
one second.

10:44.908 --> 10:46.291
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.127
Hi.

10:49.129 --> 10:50.862
Hi.
Joyce Carpenter.

10:50.864 --> 10:52.029
Frank Reagan.

10:52.031 --> 10:53.665
You're taller
than on TV.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.300
Aren't we all?

10:55.302 --> 10:56.885
(laughs)
That's a good one.

10:56.887 --> 10:59.804
Uh, I hope my subbing
for my daughter-in-law

10:59.806 --> 11:00.905
isn't a problem.

11:00.907 --> 11:02.807
Oh, the police commissioner?

11:02.809 --> 11:03.892
Are you kidding?

11:03.894 --> 11:05.426
It's all the boys
can talk about.

11:05.428 --> 11:06.594
And the girls?

11:06.596 --> 11:08.429
Girls mature faster than boys.

11:08.431 --> 11:09.714
It's now a fact.

11:09.716 --> 11:11.716
We graduated more women

11:11.718 --> 11:14.185
at the academy last year
than ever before.

11:14.187 --> 11:15.820
Congratulations.

11:16.689 --> 11:18.356
I take it you have a daughter?

11:18.358 --> 11:19.490
Daisy.

11:19.492 --> 11:21.826
She's what I like
to call pre-pre-med.

11:21.828 --> 11:24.078
At ten? How does that work?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.698
Discipline, drive,
determination.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.999
The three D's.

11:28.001 --> 11:29.951
Yeah, we don't really
call it that.

11:31.036 --> 11:32.537
A few ground rules
before we go on in.

11:32.539 --> 11:33.671
The kids are buddied up,

11:33.673 --> 11:35.573
they're gonna stay in two
straight lines.

11:35.575 --> 11:37.625
I'll take the ad,
you just follow in the rear.

11:37.627 --> 11:39.210
Okay.
You don't need to do anything

11:39.212 --> 11:40.628
but look authoritative.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.280
I'm told I'm good at that.

11:42.282 --> 11:44.582
Granular issues are
better left to me.

11:45.434 --> 11:46.551
Frank...

11:46.553 --> 11:47.552
Can I call you Frank?

11:47.554 --> 11:48.636
Please.

11:48.638 --> 11:49.988
This isn't
my first rodeo.

11:49.990 --> 11:51.973
I ran the kids' trip
to D.C. last year

11:51.975 --> 11:54.192
and to the Boston Freedom Trail
the year before that...

11:54.194 --> 11:56.311
Thank you for your service.

11:56.313 --> 11:59.364
...so as counter-intuitive
as this may seem,

11:59.366 --> 12:00.815
you're really just
to follow my lead.

12:00.817 --> 12:02.200
Hey!
Thanks so much

12:02.202 --> 12:03.484
for coming, Grandpa!

12:03.486 --> 12:04.786
Are you kidding?

12:04.788 --> 12:06.988
When I was your age,
I wanted to live in that place.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.123
Uh, Shane,
time to find your buddy.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.325
It's Sean.
It's Sean.

12:10.327 --> 12:12.293
Sean. Sorry.

12:12.295 --> 12:14.128
Buddy up.

12:16.131 --> 12:17.281
Here we go.

12:17.283 --> 12:18.633
Okay.
All right, moving forward.

12:18.635 --> 12:19.884
Two straight lines,
everybody.

12:19.886 --> 12:22.086
Move it along, kids.

12:22.088 --> 12:23.955
Let's go.

12:23.957 --> 12:25.974
Keep with your buddy.

12:25.976 --> 12:27.225
Indoor voices, please.

12:27.227 --> 12:28.626
Move!

12:28.628 --> 12:29.594
Hi, Commissioner Reagan.

12:29.596 --> 12:30.845
Hello.

12:34.266 --> 12:35.400
MAN:
<i>Maya?</i>

12:35.402 --> 12:37.068
Yeah, she worked for me.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.436
Past tense, huh?

12:38.438 --> 12:39.938
She quit a few
months back.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.406
Oh. Fake number
and a fake job?

12:41.408 --> 12:43.091
She say why she was quitting?

12:43.093 --> 12:44.659
Only said she found
a better gig,

12:44.661 --> 12:46.477
so I can take this job
and shove it.

12:46.479 --> 12:48.279
And a bad '70s song reference.

12:48.281 --> 12:49.564
I really hate this girl.

12:49.566 --> 12:51.032
What was Maya's last name,
do you know?

12:51.034 --> 12:52.083
Taylor?

12:52.085 --> 12:53.952
Taller? Tilton?

12:53.954 --> 12:54.919
You don't know?

12:54.921 --> 12:56.371
Operation like mine--

12:56.373 --> 12:57.488
it's cash in, cash out.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.257
All I need to know
about my riders:

12:59.259 --> 13:01.709
they deliver crap on
time and don't kick out

13:01.711 --> 13:03.461
too many car windows on the way.

13:03.463 --> 13:05.263
So no idea where
Maya lives, huh?

13:05.265 --> 13:06.297
Even better,

13:06.299 --> 13:08.049
I don't care.

13:08.051 --> 13:09.017
Carlos!

13:09.019 --> 13:11.352
221 East 77th!

13:11.354 --> 13:13.521
Great.
Have a nice day.

13:16.025 --> 13:17.692
There you go.

13:17.694 --> 13:18.810
Dead end.

13:18.812 --> 13:20.228
Unless we call
a few of these

13:20.230 --> 13:21.512
high-end bike
shops around here,

13:21.514 --> 13:23.614
see if anyone of them sold
her that pricey bicycle.

13:23.616 --> 13:26.067
Oh, you really are pissed.

13:27.019 --> 13:28.185
What? It's a puzzle.

13:28.187 --> 13:30.021
Oh, it's a puzzle?

13:30.023 --> 13:31.406
It's a puzzle.

13:31.408 --> 13:33.374
Your parents sound like
very nice people.

13:33.376 --> 13:34.742
JILL:
Yeah.

13:34.744 --> 13:36.911
Kilbane never even
got their names right.

13:36.913 --> 13:38.162
Kept calling my dad "Ralph."

13:38.164 --> 13:39.313
You know, Jill,

13:39.315 --> 13:41.416
I never even really
knew this Kilbane guy.

13:41.418 --> 13:43.384
Think I met him once
at a Christmas party.

13:43.386 --> 13:45.069
But there are a lot
of good cops out there.

13:45.071 --> 13:46.671
I come from
a whole family of them.

13:46.673 --> 13:47.839
Couple lawyers, too.

13:47.841 --> 13:49.090
Oh, you think
they're any better?

13:49.092 --> 13:51.592
After that son of a bitch
went to prison,

13:51.594 --> 13:53.144
they said it was
all over, too.

13:53.146 --> 13:55.229
So the person who killed
your parents was convicted?

13:55.231 --> 13:57.065
Not that it matters.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.316
Okay, when was that?

13:58.318 --> 13:59.350
All that matters

13:59.352 --> 14:00.868
is that he got out a month ago.

14:00.870 --> 14:02.236
(computer beeps)

14:02.238 --> 14:04.038
She's calling from somewhere
in Washington Heights,

14:04.040 --> 14:07.241
between 163
and 172 streets.

14:07.243 --> 14:08.609
Sarge, can we get
someone up there?

14:08.611 --> 14:10.595
That's 50 square blocks,
hundreds of buildings.

14:10.597 --> 14:11.913
What are we gonna do,
not even lift a finger?

14:11.915 --> 14:13.081
All right,
I'll send some cars,

14:13.083 --> 14:15.083
radio cars, too,
but don't get your hopes up.

14:15.085 --> 14:16.067
Am I boring you,

14:16.069 --> 14:17.118
Detective?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.003
No. I'm right here, Jill.

14:19.005 --> 14:20.238
Look,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.507
you said the person
who did this got out

14:22.509 --> 14:23.758
about a month ago.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.260
Any chance you might want
to tell me their name?

14:26.262 --> 14:28.763
You'll know when
you find our bodies.

14:28.765 --> 14:30.014
What do you mean,
"our" bodies?

14:30.016 --> 14:31.015
Didn't I mention?

14:31.017 --> 14:34.352
Before I kill myself...

14:34.354 --> 14:36.554
I'm gonna kill him.

14:43.968 --> 14:46.693
You never said anything about
killing anybody else, Jill.

14:46.694 --> 14:47.776
JILL:
If I don't kill him,

14:47.778 --> 14:50.562
he's gonna do it
to somebody else.

14:50.564 --> 14:51.580
And then you'll be a murderer.

14:51.582 --> 14:52.715
Yeah.
Like that really matters.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.682
Shouldn't it matter?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.285
I watched my parents die

14:56.287 --> 14:59.054
and I was left all alone, okay?

14:59.056 --> 15:00.222
Dekker deserves

15:00.224 --> 15:03.241
to die for that.

15:03.243 --> 15:04.209
Dekker?

15:04.211 --> 15:05.677
(sniffles)

15:05.679 --> 15:06.795
Stupid me.

15:06.797 --> 15:08.013
DANNY:
No, you're not stupid,

15:08.015 --> 15:09.247
you're just hurting, okay?

15:09.249 --> 15:11.517
But killing him is not
gonna make anything better.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.053
Yeah, well...
I'll be the judge of that.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.054
Dean Aaron Dekker.

15:15.056 --> 15:18.223
Let me guess... drunk driver?

15:18.225 --> 15:20.776
He smashed into my parents' car

15:20.778 --> 15:23.762
on Christmas Eve in 2008.

15:23.764 --> 15:25.263
And guess who was
in the backseat?

15:25.265 --> 15:27.466
So you're about 22 now?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.869
We were coming home
from midnight Mass.

15:30.871 --> 15:33.138
And I remember that
these headlights

15:33.140 --> 15:36.108
just came out of nowhere
and our car was spinning.

15:36.110 --> 15:39.044
And I remember that Dekker
never even got out.

15:40.914 --> 15:42.280
He was so drunk, he just

15:42.282 --> 15:43.832
sat there laughing
the whole time.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.717
You said Kilbane
got him convicted.

15:45.719 --> 15:47.052
He was supposed to be

15:47.054 --> 15:51.173
in for 13 years, okay?

15:51.175 --> 15:52.591
Do you hear me?

15:52.593 --> 15:56.345
But then a month ago,
I saw him on the street.

15:56.347 --> 15:57.896
And he was drinking

15:57.898 --> 16:01.633
again, and he was
laughing again!

16:01.635 --> 16:04.436
We got her last name,
we got Dekker's last name.

16:04.438 --> 16:07.022
Tell the Sarge to get on it.
He could find them.

16:07.024 --> 16:09.641
Then have him call my sister
and ask how Dekker got sprung.

16:09.643 --> 16:11.143
Jill,

16:11.145 --> 16:12.277
listen to me.

16:12.279 --> 16:13.779
I know you're upset, okay?

16:13.781 --> 16:15.280
You have every right to be.

16:15.282 --> 16:16.331
I understand completely.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.084
But killing him
and killing yourself

16:19.086 --> 16:20.419
is not the answer.

16:22.338 --> 16:24.206
If you had

16:24.208 --> 16:28.160
any idea what it feels like

16:28.162 --> 16:32.214
to see a monster walk free
while your parents are dead,

16:32.216 --> 16:36.101
you would know
that what I'm gonna do

16:36.103 --> 16:39.605
is exactly the answer.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.724
(sighs)

16:52.402 --> 16:53.685
Hello, Maya.

16:53.687 --> 16:54.853
Twice in a day?

16:54.855 --> 16:56.188
What a coincidence.

16:56.190 --> 16:58.023
Well, we're cops;
we find criminals.

16:58.025 --> 17:00.075
Is this about that $50?

17:00.077 --> 17:01.793
JANKO: Ah, it's funny you
should mention that.

17:01.795 --> 17:03.361
Yeah. We didn't.

17:03.363 --> 17:04.663
No, I'm just saying,

17:04.665 --> 17:05.830
I thought it looked
a little dodgy.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.749
But you paid with it anyway.
No, look,

17:07.751 --> 17:09.001
I probably got it on a delivery.

17:09.002 --> 17:10.169
I work for a courier service.

17:10.171 --> 17:11.470
Not lately.

17:11.472 --> 17:13.422
In fact, we haven't found
any place of employment

17:13.424 --> 17:14.890
for you since you quit Blaze.

17:14.892 --> 17:16.258
In fact, we haven't found
So it's really weird

17:16.260 --> 17:18.242
you can afford
a fancy place like this.

17:18.244 --> 17:21.646
Or that you paid cash for a
fancy bike at Yorkville Cycles.

17:23.215 --> 17:24.433
Okay.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.902
I'm sorry for giving you
that fake number.

17:26.904 --> 17:28.186
A little sleight-of-hand?

17:28.189 --> 17:29.821
Keep the cops' eyes off the $50?

17:29.823 --> 17:31.890
I said I don't know
where I got it.

17:31.892 --> 17:33.892
So you wouldn't mind us
going through your bag, then?

17:33.894 --> 17:36.745
I mean, if you like
sweaty gym clothes.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.747
Okay.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.875
Please.

17:49.877 --> 17:50.759
I didn't make those.

17:50.761 --> 17:51.910
Yeah? Then who did?

17:51.912 --> 17:53.528
I can't tell you.
JANKO: All right.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.430
Hands behind your back, girly.
No...

17:55.432 --> 17:58.433
Well, I only make
the deliveries, all right?

17:58.435 --> 17:59.885
All right, listen.

17:59.887 --> 18:01.887
He is a whack job,
and if he finds out

18:01.889 --> 18:04.056
I even took a $50 from
the bundle, he'll kill me.

18:04.058 --> 18:06.141
Isn't it weird, Officer Janko,
how her mouth keeps moving

18:06.143 --> 18:07.893
but all we hear is
"blah, blah, blah"?

18:07.895 --> 18:09.311
Let's go.

18:09.313 --> 18:10.262
Wait...

18:10.264 --> 18:11.363
Wait. Wait wait,
wait, wait.

18:11.365 --> 18:12.648
Wait.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.567
His name is Ronnie Warner.

18:15.569 --> 18:16.935
He's an artist
who couldn't

18:16.937 --> 18:19.404
make any money,
so he started making money.

18:19.406 --> 18:20.405
Where'd you meet him?

18:20.407 --> 18:21.606
At a club,
all right?

18:21.608 --> 18:23.625
Look, I...

18:23.627 --> 18:24.626
I'm a singer--

18:24.628 --> 18:26.495
or a least trying
to be one--

18:26.497 --> 18:28.213
and when he found out
that I could ride,

18:28.215 --> 18:30.082
he asked if I would
courier for him.

18:30.084 --> 18:31.466
And...

18:31.468 --> 18:34.803
I knew it wasn't
the right way to go, but...

18:34.805 --> 18:37.639
haven't you ever wanted to be
something more than you are?

18:37.641 --> 18:40.158
JANKO: Okay, okay,
tell your sob story

18:40.160 --> 18:41.727
to the Feds when
we turn you in.

18:41.729 --> 18:42.761
No, come on.

18:42.763 --> 18:44.012
Here, hold on, partner.

18:44.014 --> 18:46.148
Hold on.

18:49.635 --> 18:51.469
Maybe we don't.

18:51.471 --> 18:52.804
mean, collaring her is good,

18:52.806 --> 18:54.573
but collaring her and Warner,
that's even better.

18:54.575 --> 18:56.658
As much as you want
to solve the puzzle,

18:56.660 --> 18:57.976
that is not our job.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.496
Yeah, well, a little
initiative never hurt.

19:03.983 --> 19:07.485
Remember, look with your eyes,
not with your hands.

19:09.756 --> 19:12.541
Keep those rows
straight, please.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.977
Okay, stop right here.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.329
All right.
Bathroom break, anyone?

19:18.998 --> 19:21.600
Okay, Frank,
could I talk to you, please?

19:25.171 --> 19:26.638
Yes, Joyce?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.056
Uh, I don't know if...

19:28.058 --> 19:29.808
if you've been noticing,
but there's a man back there.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.177
He's been following us
from hall to hall.

19:32.179 --> 19:34.946
That's Detective Nuciforo.

19:34.948 --> 19:36.348
He's my security detail.

19:36.350 --> 19:37.449
Sorry.

19:37.451 --> 19:38.617
Right.

19:40.036 --> 19:42.154
You always have to stay alert
for stranger danger.

19:42.156 --> 19:44.122
You know, they're just kids,
after all.

19:44.124 --> 19:46.691
Well, while we're
on the subject,

19:46.693 --> 19:49.795
if I might make a suggestion?

19:49.797 --> 19:52.964
I know things have changed
since I was a boy,

19:52.966 --> 19:54.299
but some things are timeless.

19:54.301 --> 19:55.851
I'm not reading you.

19:55.853 --> 19:57.836
Well, if you put a bunch
of ten-year-olds together,

19:57.838 --> 20:00.172
boys and girls,
and tell them to pee,

20:00.174 --> 20:01.340
no one'll go first.

20:01.342 --> 20:03.725
That's not true.

20:05.895 --> 20:09.047
Last chance for
a bathroom break, kids.

20:11.217 --> 20:13.151
Anyone?

20:15.071 --> 20:17.739
Okay, everybody, take five
up against the wall.

20:17.741 --> 20:19.908
At ease.

20:22.895 --> 20:25.964
I got to go.
Get out of the way!

20:25.966 --> 20:27.616
I really got to go!

20:27.618 --> 20:28.867
This isn't on the schedule.

20:28.869 --> 20:32.070
Well, see, that's another thing;
the schedule.

20:32.072 --> 20:33.789
To be honest, it's killing us.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.290
What do you mean?

20:35.292 --> 20:38.510
Well, so far, we've been through
the Hall of Biodiversity,

20:38.512 --> 20:40.912
the Hall of Gems & Minerals,
the Hall of Ocean Life.

20:40.914 --> 20:42.047
Yes, so?

20:42.049 --> 20:43.298
They're ten!

20:43.300 --> 20:45.600
They want to see the dinosaurs
and saber-toothed tigers.

20:45.602 --> 20:48.019
Well, they want to have salty
snacks and drink soda, too.

20:48.021 --> 20:49.187
Doesn't mean it's good for them.

20:49.189 --> 20:50.889
I'm gonna go
freshen up.

20:50.891 --> 20:54.226
When I get back, we're getting
back on schedule, okay?

20:54.228 --> 20:56.228
Sure.

20:58.064 --> 20:58.980
(sighs)

20:58.982 --> 21:00.065
SEAN:
Grandpa?

21:00.067 --> 21:01.533
Yeah?

21:01.535 --> 21:02.868
This is my friend, Daisy.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.703
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Daisy.

21:04.705 --> 21:05.704
You having fun?

21:05.706 --> 21:07.605
Very much so.

21:07.607 --> 21:09.875
Your mom says that you want
to be a doctor.

21:09.877 --> 21:12.127
That's what she tells me, too.

21:12.129 --> 21:13.829
But can I tell you a secret?

21:13.831 --> 21:15.664
Sure.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.799
What I really want to be
is a park ranger.

21:17.801 --> 21:19.384
Is that right?

21:19.386 --> 21:20.802
I know a lot about it already.

21:20.804 --> 21:22.304
Well...
Grandpa,

21:22.306 --> 21:23.788
can we see the dinosaurs soon?

21:27.477 --> 21:29.928
I'm working on that.

21:29.930 --> 21:32.481
Now you're the one
who's being quiet, Jill.

21:32.483 --> 21:33.565
Just getting ready.

21:33.567 --> 21:34.900
You really think

21:34.902 --> 21:36.151
you can kill Dekker?

21:36.153 --> 21:38.487
Come on. It's not like
the movies, kid.

21:38.489 --> 21:39.738
The screams alone
will be terrible.

21:39.740 --> 21:41.857
It's exactly
what I want to hear.

21:41.859 --> 21:44.443
Okay, so where is he?

21:44.445 --> 21:45.827
Oh, you gonna go protect him?

21:45.829 --> 21:48.163
Where were you
when I needed protecting?

21:48.165 --> 21:50.832
I'm here now, Jill.
I'm protecting you right now.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.834
I mean, what's gonna happen
to you if he's not there,

21:52.836 --> 21:53.835
if you can't find him?

21:53.837 --> 21:55.504
I mean,
what if he recognizes you

21:55.506 --> 21:57.489
and runs?

21:57.491 --> 22:00.325
Dekker's not gonna get away.

22:00.327 --> 22:02.043
(Taser crackling)

22:04.847 --> 22:07.165
You really think
this'll work?

22:07.167 --> 22:09.000
Your partner didn't
seem to think so.

22:09.002 --> 22:11.186
That's why I'm not just
some clown off the street.

22:11.188 --> 22:13.104
If Warner thinks that
I'm your boyfriend,

22:13.106 --> 22:14.639
then he'll let
his guard down.

22:14.641 --> 22:16.341
The guy is
seriously paranoid.

22:16.343 --> 22:17.943
He's gonna grill
me about you.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.110
Like?

22:19.112 --> 22:20.345
Where did we meet?

22:20.347 --> 22:22.447
You delivered a package
to my house last year

22:22.449 --> 22:24.015
when you were working
for Blaze.

22:24.017 --> 22:25.951
Where'd you grow up?
Bayridge.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.352
What do your parents do?

22:27.354 --> 22:29.571
Mom passed away, Dad...

22:29.573 --> 22:31.623
Dad's a security guard.

22:31.625 --> 22:32.958
What's your
favorite position?

22:34.076 --> 22:37.045
All right, that
one was for me.

22:37.047 --> 22:39.498
Your feet spread apart,
hands on the hood.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.916
(laughs)

22:40.918 --> 22:43.084
Good one.

22:45.888 --> 22:47.889
You really
from Bayridge?

22:47.891 --> 22:49.975
Your dad really
a security guard?

22:49.977 --> 22:52.877
Bayridge, yeah.

22:52.879 --> 22:55.380
Dad-- not exactly.

22:57.817 --> 23:00.068
This is it.

23:05.408 --> 23:06.608
Ronnie has to
buzz us in.

23:06.610 --> 23:09.494
So, um, smile
for the camera.

23:11.364 --> 23:13.281
Wait, wait.

23:19.121 --> 23:20.905
No.

23:20.907 --> 23:23.341
No? What's wrong?

23:24.210 --> 23:26.077
This is. Come on.

23:27.713 --> 23:29.848
Why'd you change your mind?

23:29.850 --> 23:32.083
I just did.

23:32.085 --> 23:34.519
No one's found Jill
or Dekker yet?

23:34.521 --> 23:35.587
No, still searching.

23:35.589 --> 23:37.305
You get any backstory
on his trial?

23:37.307 --> 23:39.474
It was open-and-shut; Dekker
had been drinking all day

23:39.476 --> 23:40.775
in a bar in Maspeth

23:40.777 --> 23:42.143
and then crashed
into the Gallagher's car.

23:42.145 --> 23:45.030
He got 13 years for first
degree vehicular manslaughter.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.281
So how's he out now?

23:46.283 --> 23:47.566
After he was sentenced,

23:47.568 --> 23:49.401
Dekker hired another
lawyer who found

23:49.403 --> 23:51.987
inconsistencies in
Kilbane's paperwork

23:51.989 --> 23:54.539
and the way the Breathalyzer
had been administered.

23:54.541 --> 23:56.207
I never heard
Kilbane screwed up.

23:56.209 --> 23:59.544
That's because my office
made mistakes, too.

23:59.546 --> 24:01.963
Dekker's lawyer said he
wouldn't take it public

24:01.965 --> 24:03.582
as long as
Dekker walked.

24:03.584 --> 24:05.650
Sarge, we got addresses
on the girl and Dekker.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.168
All right. Excuse me.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.754
DANNY:
Jill, listen to me.

24:09.756 --> 24:12.807
You do not want this thing
to end in a bloodbath.

24:12.809 --> 24:15.010
Do you hear me?
You don't have to do this.

24:15.012 --> 24:17.262
Jill?

24:17.264 --> 24:19.264
It's the only way the world's
gonna know the truth.

24:19.266 --> 24:20.265
Jill, listen.

24:20.267 --> 24:22.267
I told you
about my sister Erin.

24:22.269 --> 24:24.019
She works at the D.A.'s office.

24:24.021 --> 24:25.136
She's here.

24:25.138 --> 24:27.472
She's gonna try to help you.
Hold on.

24:27.474 --> 24:29.858
Hi, Jill. I wasn't on
the case back then,

24:29.860 --> 24:31.109
but I know
what happened,

24:31.111 --> 24:33.028
and I think I can talk
to my boss...

24:33.030 --> 24:35.530
When are you people gonna get it
through your thick skulls, okay?

24:35.532 --> 24:36.548
There are no more

24:36.550 --> 24:37.666
police investigations.

24:37.668 --> 24:38.983
No more court cases.

24:38.985 --> 24:41.369
You had your chance
and you blew it.

24:41.371 --> 24:42.921
Jill, just talk to her
a little bit.

24:42.923 --> 24:44.122
(watch beeps)

24:44.124 --> 24:45.707
It's time to go.

24:45.709 --> 24:46.708
Jill! Jill!

24:46.710 --> 24:47.709
First he dies,

24:47.711 --> 24:49.827
and then I do.

24:49.829 --> 24:52.213
And remember,
I am only doing this

24:52.215 --> 24:54.349
because all of you screwed up!

24:54.351 --> 24:56.935
Listen to me.
Do not do anything...

24:56.937 --> 24:58.153
(phone beeps)

24:58.155 --> 25:00.021
Jill? Jill?

25:00.023 --> 25:01.690
Jill!

25:11.592 --> 25:14.977
(line ringing)

25:17.732 --> 25:19.632
Answer the phone.

25:19.634 --> 25:21.100
Where the hell is she now?

25:21.102 --> 25:24.320
Our girl is moving south
on the West Side.

25:24.322 --> 25:26.906
But the area's still
too big to pinpoint.

25:26.908 --> 25:28.574
Well, if she's headed
to Dekker's place,

25:28.576 --> 25:29.525
she won't find him.

25:29.527 --> 25:30.677
Patrol found
his place empty.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.144
Trying to find his ex-wife;
maybe she knows.

25:32.146 --> 25:33.579
What about Jill's place?

25:33.581 --> 25:34.980
Uh, missed her, too.

25:34.982 --> 25:36.416
We searched inside,
found nothing indicating

25:36.418 --> 25:37.917
where she'll make
her move on Dekker,

25:37.919 --> 25:39.985
but I got a description
of her car

25:39.987 --> 25:41.704
and I put it out over the air.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.489
Great.
I'm not surprised

25:43.491 --> 25:45.024
Kilbane messed this up.

25:45.026 --> 25:46.376
Probably couldn't even read
his own notes.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.493
Those cheap cell phones
she's using,

25:47.495 --> 25:49.212
she can take a text on that,
right?

25:49.214 --> 25:51.180
I don't know.
Some can and some can't.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.299
Come on, Jill.
Do the right thing.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.000
Danny, did you talk to Ryan?

25:55.002 --> 25:56.602
'Cause he might know her plan.

25:56.604 --> 25:58.071
Who's Ryan?

25:58.073 --> 25:59.689
Her brother, Ryan Gallagher.

25:59.691 --> 26:00.723
It's right here
in Kilbane's notes.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.892
She never said
she had a brother.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.127
I don't know why not.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.479
He was in the car
the night of the accident.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.680
I'll find Ryan.

26:07.682 --> 26:10.015
Son of a bitch.

26:11.985 --> 26:13.753
She was Warner's courier,
so she knows everything:

26:13.755 --> 26:16.122
where he gets his paper,
who's on his client list.

26:16.124 --> 26:18.975
She agreed to
testify against him.

26:18.977 --> 26:22.879
Secret Service has had Warner on
our radar for quite some time.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.197
Glad I could help.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.871
Time to go.

26:31.873 --> 26:34.424
Guess it's too late
to give you my real number.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.926
Concentrate on not getting
a prison number.

26:39.313 --> 26:41.097
(handcuffs clicking)

26:46.403 --> 26:48.387
Oh, well.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.324
It was cute
while it lasted.

26:51.326 --> 26:53.326
You're still here?
Tour ended hours ago.

26:53.328 --> 26:55.278
I wanted to watch you
march Warner in.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.996
That didn't happen.

26:56.998 --> 26:59.132
Maya jerk you around again?

26:59.134 --> 27:01.501
No, nothing to do with her.

27:01.503 --> 27:02.502
Hey.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.906
You want to go grab a drink,
talk about it?

27:07.791 --> 27:10.276
I'd be talking
to the wrong person.

27:11.845 --> 27:14.097
Night, partner.

27:18.602 --> 27:21.721
SEAN: I got to say,
I like the zoo better.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.255
Stuff moves at least.

27:28.695 --> 27:29.762
So, you having any fun?

27:29.764 --> 27:31.564
Yeah, the butterflies were
pretty cool.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.899
So I guess that was fun.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.184
But I don't think Daisy
and her mom are.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.786
Yeah, well, it's tough
when your parents

27:36.788 --> 27:38.404
chaperone one of
these things.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.457
I get the feeling it's tough
with Daisy's mom, period.

27:41.459 --> 27:44.544
Mm. Hold on a second, Sean.

27:45.412 --> 27:47.797
Everybody?

27:47.799 --> 27:49.448
Could I have your attention?
Thank you.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.116
I think that we should

27:51.118 --> 27:54.220
give a big hand
to Mrs. Carpenter

27:54.222 --> 27:56.506
for putting on
such a great trip.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.744
And, you know,

28:01.746 --> 28:04.597
we were, uh...
we were talking a while ago,

28:04.599 --> 28:06.265
and I think that Mrs. Carpenter

28:06.267 --> 28:08.234
feels that because

28:08.236 --> 28:10.302
there's two of us and 28 of you,

28:10.304 --> 28:13.656
maybe you should decide
what we see next.

28:14.775 --> 28:16.359
So, anybody for dinosaurs?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.945
KIDS:
Yeah!

28:18.947 --> 28:20.496
North American mammals?

28:20.498 --> 28:23.716
KIDS:
Yeah!

28:23.718 --> 28:25.818
Okay, let's eat up and clean up
on the double.

28:25.820 --> 28:27.670
We got a lot of ground to cover.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.703
You just do not give up,
Detective, do you?

28:50.110 --> 28:53.196
(phone ringing)

28:53.198 --> 28:55.114
Guess my text got
your attention, huh?

28:55.116 --> 28:56.532
Is my brother really there?

28:56.534 --> 28:58.818
Jilly, what the hell
are you doing?

28:58.820 --> 29:00.686
Th say you have a gun.

29:00.688 --> 29:03.239
You had no right
to get him involved in this!

29:03.241 --> 29:04.857
Of course

29:04.859 --> 29:06.576
you're upset Dekker's out.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.910
You think I'm not?

29:07.912 --> 29:09.795
But don't become him.

29:09.797 --> 29:12.982
Look, you don't get a vote,
Ryan, okay?

29:12.984 --> 29:15.334
You stopped visiting
Mom and Dad,

29:15.336 --> 29:19.204
and I still go
every single Sunday.

29:19.206 --> 29:20.790
I go when you're not there.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.060
I just can't
deal with you anymore.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.629
(voice breaking):
Why? Because I still care?

29:26.631 --> 29:28.648
Nothing you do
will bring them back.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.549
And they would want you
to move on.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.435
Please, don't do this.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.552
(sobbing softly)

29:33.554 --> 29:36.239
Jilly, I can't lose you,
too, okay?

29:36.241 --> 29:38.658
(whispering): Dekker's ex says
he spends most of his time

29:38.660 --> 29:40.276
in a bar near
Hudson Yards.

29:40.278 --> 29:44.163
I got a radio car headed there,
so keep her on the line.

29:44.165 --> 29:46.699
Jill...

29:46.701 --> 29:48.567
Jill, listen to your brother,
okay?

29:48.569 --> 29:50.086
He cares about you
and he doesn't want

29:50.088 --> 29:51.420
anything to happen to you.

29:51.422 --> 29:54.423
Neither do we,
so stop this, okay?

29:54.425 --> 29:55.741
You got to stop now.

29:58.262 --> 30:00.112
It's too late now.

30:00.114 --> 30:01.597
Jill, it's not too late
for anything, Jill.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.015
Just drive away!

30:03.017 --> 30:04.267
GORMLEY:
The RMP's 15 blocks

30:04.269 --> 30:06.251
from the bar;
keep her on the phone.

30:09.422 --> 30:12.091
Look, maybe you do care,
Detective Reagan.

30:14.027 --> 30:15.394
And maybe you're
not like the others.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.263
Jill, just
listen to me.

30:18.265 --> 30:20.366
Get back in your car, okay?

30:20.368 --> 30:23.869
Just get back in the
vehicle and drive away.

30:23.871 --> 30:26.122
Ryan, I want you to know
how much I love you, okay?

30:26.124 --> 30:27.156
(sobbing)

30:27.158 --> 30:28.958
Jill, I love you, too. Please.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.910
Please, look, look,
I know I've been a bad brother

30:30.912 --> 30:32.878
and I haven't been there
for you sometimes, but please

30:32.880 --> 30:34.714
just don't do this,
don't leave me right now, okay?

30:34.716 --> 30:36.749
Just get back in the car.

30:38.719 --> 30:39.885
Hi. I-I'm sorry.

30:39.887 --> 30:40.920
My, , ....

30:40.922 --> 30:42.138
my front tire went flat.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.889
And...
Jill?

30:43.891 --> 30:47.259
I-I can't even find a jack
or anything.

30:47.261 --> 30:49.929
I'm always happy
to help a pretty girl.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.814
It's got to be Dekker.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.318
I'm sure it's in here.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.869
No jack.

30:56.871 --> 30:59.405
I can always give you a ride.

30:59.407 --> 31:00.656
Come on, Jill. Come on, Jill.

31:00.658 --> 31:01.774
Don't do this.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.326
Wait.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.528
Haven't we met?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.780
You're gonna wish
we never had.

31:07.782 --> 31:08.648
(chuckles)

31:08.650 --> 31:10.816
(Taser crackling)

31:10.818 --> 31:11.500
Jill!

31:11.502 --> 31:13.252
(Dekker grunting)

31:16.823 --> 31:19.258
(grunting)

31:21.845 --> 31:25.014
GORMLEY: Keep her on the phone.
They're only a few blocks away.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.665
Jill? Jill?

31:27.884 --> 31:29.719
Bye, everyone.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.554
RYAN:
Jill, no! Jill, Jill!

31:31.556 --> 31:33.072
No! No, stop!

31:33.074 --> 31:34.056
Come back! Jill!

31:34.058 --> 31:35.841
Jill, stop it!

31:35.843 --> 31:38.527
(siren wailing,
tires screeching)

31:44.951 --> 31:46.919
OFFICER:
I'm sorry, Detective.

31:46.921 --> 31:48.738
Her car's nowhere in sight.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.522
She's gone.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.210
Great.

32:08.091 --> 32:10.193
Danny, you did
everything you could.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.394
No, I didn't. I screwed up.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.729
I shouldn't have
brought the kid.

32:12.731 --> 32:13.946
Go ahead, say it, Sarge.

32:13.948 --> 32:16.399
I blew it just like
you said I would.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.518
Nah.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.086
You did good, Reagan.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.854
Just can't figure out,
if she didn't kill him there,

32:21.856 --> 32:23.423
where the hell
is she taking him?

32:23.425 --> 32:26.609
She's got to know we got cars
at her place and Dekker's.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.712
You said that you
and your sister visited

32:29.714 --> 32:30.963
your parents, right?

32:30.965 --> 32:32.048
Cemetery?

32:32.050 --> 32:34.250
No, they don't have graves.

32:34.252 --> 32:36.952
They were cremated and had
their ashes spread around.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.005
But?
But Jill wanted a place

32:39.007 --> 32:40.807
to go so she could talk to them.

32:40.809 --> 32:42.391
Where?

32:42.393 --> 32:44.627
My mom used to volunteer in
the gardens at Riverdale Park.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.146
They let us plant a tree tre.

32:47.148 --> 32:50.016
That's got to be it.

32:55.439 --> 32:58.191
And as superintendent
of the police commission,

32:58.193 --> 33:00.576
he cleaned up corruption
in the department,

33:00.578 --> 33:02.278
and he earned
a reputation

33:02.280 --> 33:05.147
that helped him become governor
of the state of New York,

33:05.149 --> 33:09.118
and then the 26th president
of the United States.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.036
Didn't he go to war, too?

33:10.038 --> 33:11.420
FRANK: Ah, he was
a soldier, yes.

33:11.422 --> 33:12.672
Maybe you remember him

33:12.674 --> 33:15.041
and his Rough Riders
at the battle of San Juan Hill.

33:15.043 --> 33:16.826
But you know

33:16.828 --> 33:20.880
what Theodore Roosevelt loved
more than politics

33:20.882 --> 33:22.548
and battle and everything else?

33:22.550 --> 33:24.100
What?

33:24.102 --> 33:25.101
He loved nature.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.503
Can anybody tell me

33:27.505 --> 33:29.689
how President Roosevelt
showed the American people

33:29.691 --> 33:31.357
how much he loved our land?

33:31.359 --> 33:32.675
Wow.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.061
Well, let's see.

33:37.865 --> 33:40.867
Uh, let's not put anyone
on the spot, Commissioner.

33:40.869 --> 33:42.351
It's not an exam.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.537
Teddy Roosevelt created
the U.S. Forest Service,

33:44.539 --> 33:46.756
established 51 federal
bird reservations,

33:46.758 --> 33:50.910
four national game preserves,
150 national forests

33:50.912 --> 33:52.578
and five national parks.

33:53.697 --> 33:55.665
That is exactly right.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.466
How do you know all that?

33:57.468 --> 33:59.652
I want to be a park ranger
when I grow up.

33:59.654 --> 34:03.372
I mean, sort of.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.141
And I'm sure you'd
make a great one, too.

34:06.226 --> 34:09.712
But you can do more than
one thing, you know.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.013
You can?

34:11.014 --> 34:12.315
Sure.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.183
Take Teddy here.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.936
Top cop, governor,

34:16.938 --> 34:18.487
president...

34:18.489 --> 34:19.655
KIDS:
Soldier.

34:19.657 --> 34:20.723
...soldier,

34:20.725 --> 34:22.440
conservationist,

34:22.443 --> 34:25.277
and he wrote a whole lot of
books about his experiences,

34:25.280 --> 34:28.547
so you can add writer
to the list as well.

34:28.550 --> 34:30.248
Wow.

34:30.251 --> 34:31.500
Yeah.

34:39.208 --> 34:40.909
Go! Go, I said!

34:40.911 --> 34:43.346
(Dekker crying)

34:43.348 --> 34:44.746
Why'd you bring me here?

34:44.748 --> 34:46.047
Shut up!

34:46.050 --> 34:47.216
Please...

34:47.217 --> 34:48.417
Shut up.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.685
You don't want to do this.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.972
Turn around and
don't look at me.

34:52.974 --> 34:53.940
Please.

34:53.942 --> 34:55.474
Get on your knees!

34:56.525 --> 34:57.610
Get on your knees!

34:57.612 --> 34:58.811
(grunts)

34:58.813 --> 35:00.897
Please!

35:00.899 --> 35:02.765
For the love of God, please.

35:03.934 --> 35:05.318
Don't kill me.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.403
Where's your laugh now, huh?

35:07.405 --> 35:09.155
Laugh? What laugh?

35:09.157 --> 35:11.073
What I heard
when I watched

35:11.075 --> 35:12.441
my parents die-- where is it?!

35:12.443 --> 35:14.160
Where is it?!

35:18.048 --> 35:19.415
I'm sorry!

35:19.417 --> 35:21.584
I have a drinking problem.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.636
And-and I did my time!

35:23.638 --> 35:25.421
I'm sorry.

35:25.423 --> 35:29.892
You are gonna pay
for what you did.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.477
(sobbing softly)

35:33.146 --> 35:34.063
Do it!

35:34.065 --> 35:35.348
Go ahead!

35:35.350 --> 35:37.466
(sobbing)
Just do it already!

35:37.468 --> 35:39.652
Except you can't.

35:39.654 --> 35:41.354
Can you, Jill?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.074
You didn't think I'd give up
that easy, did you?

35:45.076 --> 35:46.826
Well, it's too late.

35:46.828 --> 35:49.011
Leave me alone.

35:49.013 --> 35:50.613
DANNY:
You're a smart girl, Jill.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.866
You proved it all day long.

35:53.868 --> 35:56.118
just couldn't figure out
one last thing.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.837
How to get revenge

35:57.839 --> 35:59.205
without killing him.

35:59.207 --> 36:01.223
You don't think I can shoot him?
Watch me!

36:01.225 --> 36:03.376
(sobbing)

36:04.294 --> 36:06.796
(panting)

36:06.798 --> 36:07.897
I'm waiting, Jill.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.099
(sobbing)

36:10.101 --> 36:11.050
Not that easy, is it?

36:11.052 --> 36:12.718
(sobbing):
Please kill him,

36:12.720 --> 36:15.021
and then kill me.

36:15.023 --> 36:17.106
It's not gonna happen.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.107
Why? It's fine.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.191
You can use my gun.

36:19.193 --> 36:21.978
Just tell everyone
that I did it.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.863
(sobbing)

36:26.950 --> 36:29.368
And then what?

36:29.370 --> 36:32.288
Ruin this beautiful
friendship?

36:32.290 --> 36:33.689
Come on, give me that.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.691
Give me that.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.544
(sobbing)

36:38.546 --> 36:40.246
Step back, sweetheart.

36:40.248 --> 36:41.797
Step back.

36:47.671 --> 36:49.055
You all right?

36:49.057 --> 36:50.222
Thank you!

36:50.224 --> 36:52.207
She's crazy, right?

36:53.010 --> 36:55.311
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.882
(sobbing continues)

37:01.735 --> 37:04.437
It's okay.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.489
Let's get you
out of here now, okay?

37:06.491 --> 37:09.892
Let your parents
rest in peace.

37:18.785 --> 37:20.903
Heard you had
a great time, kiddo.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.621
I had a blast!

37:22.623 --> 37:24.206
I held a walking stick.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.043
I'm looking forward
to that myself.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.094
He means the insect.

37:28.096 --> 37:30.012
I know that, Darwin.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.965
So, Frank, how was Joyce?

37:32.967 --> 37:35.017
Seldom right,
but never uncertain.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.770
Yeah, she always
did seem a little...

37:37.772 --> 37:39.438
intense to me.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.723
(chuckles)

37:40.725 --> 37:41.807
I heard she's the B word.

37:41.809 --> 37:42.608
What?

37:42.610 --> 37:44.060
Excuse me.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.311
That's not appropriate, Jack.

37:45.313 --> 37:47.863
Sean said it, not me.

37:47.865 --> 37:48.864
Is that true, young man?

37:48.866 --> 37:49.815
Because your ability

37:49.817 --> 37:50.866
to sit down for a week

37:50.868 --> 37:53.069
hangs in the balance.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.138
A kid on the trip said it first.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.456
And Nicky said it
wasn't bad language

37:57.458 --> 37:58.774
unless you actually
said the word.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.209
(chuckles):
Oh.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.560
Oh, really?

38:01.562 --> 38:03.212
Okay.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.498
Technically I'm right.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.550
Technically you're still young
enough to get grounded.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.768
(Henry groans)

38:08.770 --> 38:10.586
Actually, I made some judgments
when we first met,

38:10.588 --> 38:12.471
and I don't think
they were fair.

38:12.473 --> 38:13.622
JACK: I thought cops are
supposed to be able

38:13.624 --> 38:15.624
to tell who people are
from just one look,

38:15.626 --> 38:16.959
so they don't trust
the wrong people

38:16.961 --> 38:18.627
and get shot at or something.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.896
They teach us character
assessment in the academy.

38:20.898 --> 38:23.649
And cops are only human.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.018
I can't believe
I just said that.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.353
JAMIE:
Works the other way, too.

38:27.355 --> 38:28.687
Sometimes someone
you think is nice

38:28.689 --> 38:30.139
turns out to be a crook.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.907
Not that being right

38:31.909 --> 38:33.409
does you much good either way.

38:37.330 --> 38:38.531
Come on, Grandpa.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.332
It's time for dessert.
Just one more page

38:40.334 --> 38:42.034
on this and
I'll deserve it.

38:42.036 --> 38:44.036
(laughs)
Very funny.

38:48.091 --> 38:49.825
Secret Service was impressed.

38:51.261 --> 38:52.878
I hear things.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.131
So, they told you
I went off the reservation?

38:55.133 --> 38:57.883
And returned before you got
yourself into trouble.

39:02.772 --> 39:05.941
Dad, how long was it
before you made detective?

39:07.444 --> 39:08.561
Three years.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.279
Danny made it
in three and a half.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.698
Good genes.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.534
Guess I didn't get them.

39:17.954 --> 39:21.207
Been on patrol for...
for four years now.

39:23.793 --> 39:26.462
Four years?

39:26.464 --> 39:30.199
Seems like you just
graduated the academy.

39:33.904 --> 39:36.405
You think something's
holding you back.

39:37.307 --> 39:38.757
(footsteps approaching)

39:38.759 --> 39:40.643
NICKY: Can someone grab
those napkins, please?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.228
And give me a hand in here?

39:42.230 --> 39:44.396
Yeah, I'm on it.
Thanks.
