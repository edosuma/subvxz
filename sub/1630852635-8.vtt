WEBVTT

00:12.375 --> 00:14.083
Beloved servants.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.750
Your goddess is risen.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.666
Luna, most faithful of all,

00:19.750 --> 00:21.500
you will lead them home.

00:22.416 --> 00:23.833
Goddess.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.583
I am uncertain.

00:25.666 --> 00:26.541
Be certain.

00:27.583 --> 00:32.500
When I first came to the woods,
when you found me, I was broken.

00:32.583 --> 00:34.000
Broken in every way.

00:34.083 --> 00:38.083
My body, my soul.
You put me back together.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.583
I was empty and you filled me.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.750
I was at peace
until you needed the scourge.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.750
You drove her out. Sent her to war.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.750
You broke me, goddess.

00:51.833 --> 00:55.500
And I cannot be both things.
Priestess and scourge.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.458
Speak carefully to me.

00:58.541 --> 00:59.916
I reject you.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.041
I reject tyrants in all forms,
elves, humans, gods.

01:04.125 --> 01:06.750
[whispers]
And I will not worship you.

01:06.833 --> 01:07.916
[groans]

01:08.000 --> 01:09.333
And the rest of you?

01:09.416 --> 01:13.791
The captain and the princess
led us out of the hell you left us in.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.375
I choose them.

01:15.458 --> 01:18.208
[Selemene] You choose to be nothing.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.375
So be it.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.750
[all screaming]

01:22.875 --> 01:23.791
[groans]

01:23.875 --> 01:25.500
[Hieronimo grunting]

01:27.083 --> 01:29.958
You have chosen your fate.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.583
[Luna exhales deeply]

01:34.666 --> 01:35.791
[Hieronimo] I'm proud of you.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.250
So, what would you have us do now?

01:39.458 --> 01:41.083
We aid our brothers.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.625
[Luna] As Mirana commands.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
[theme music playing]

02:39.625 --> 02:40.750
[elf man] The Leylines.

02:41.666 --> 02:42.500
We're saved.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.500
The goddess returns. Mene returns.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.416
Not Mene. Not our goddess.

02:50.083 --> 02:53.750
Come! Everyone!
Fade to the forest! Archers ready!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.416
[elf woman] How could you?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.416
[elves grunting]

02:59.416 --> 03:01.250
The sorcerer betrayed us.

03:01.833 --> 03:06.208
[Terrorblade] All is lost.
The world has come undone.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.000
Your little godling failed you.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.500
But the blame is not with her.

03:14.500 --> 03:20.208
My smallest gesture helped her see you
for what you truly are.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.458
The godling acted according to her nature.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.041
No more, no less.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.500
I've taken her faith from you.

03:30.291 --> 03:33.375
[Terrorblade] Without her,
your plans come to nothing.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.500
You've exposed your weakness.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.916
Your dependence on others
still affect the material world.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.458
You corrupt them.

03:42.541 --> 03:48.333
I trust them to be who they are
as I trust you to be who you are.

03:48.416 --> 03:51.125
And for that, I owe you my thanks.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.708
[grandiose music playing]

04:12.458 --> 04:13.916
[Kashurra] Lay down your weapon.

04:14.833 --> 04:19.666
I would never harm you, my little Sunbeam.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.541
[Mirana] Never harm me?

04:21.625 --> 04:24.958
It was you, wasn't it?
You murdered my parents.

04:25.041 --> 04:28.166
[Mirana] You took them from me.
You took everything from me!

04:28.250 --> 04:31.625
I would not have had you
repeat your father's mistakes.

04:31.708 --> 04:35.375
I would not have you
share the doom that came upon him.

04:35.458 --> 04:40.750
You are the light. I am the Void.
You are my purpose. My kneeling.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.833
You've lied to me my whole life.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.291
[Kashurra]
I simply know what you really are.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.625
I know what I am.
I am my father's daughter.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.333
[Kashurra screams]

04:52.500 --> 04:56.000
These things, these mice who surround you,

04:56.083 --> 05:00.250
they cloud your mind,
blind you to your own nature.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.833
I would clear your vision.

05:02.916 --> 05:05.333
Withdraw to the palace! Quickly!

05:05.416 --> 05:06.708
No! It's a dragon!

05:06.791 --> 05:08.500
[Auroth] Be silent and flee.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.916
Protect the princess. Take her to the Eye.

05:12.833 --> 05:15.916
It's our only chance, Princess.
You are our only chance.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.083
[Auroth] Claim your father's power.
Claim his throne.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.083
What about you?

05:20.166 --> 05:25.125
I'll write a poem. It will be beautiful.
It will be for you.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.333
[heroic music playing]

05:31.000 --> 05:34.833
You will find me more formidable
than a mouse.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.500
[panting]

05:38.583 --> 05:42.125
I can't. I can't leave Davion.
I can't leave her.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.708
[Bram] I know I swore to protect you.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.875
You won't run from a fight.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.666
Princess, it was an honor.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.333
Sagan.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.875
Yi-yah!

05:52.958 --> 05:54.375
Crazy. Stupid.

05:54.458 --> 05:55.500
-[crashing in distance]
-[screams]

05:55.583 --> 05:58.500
[Bram gasping]

05:59.500 --> 06:00.500
[Auroth] Bram.

06:02.500 --> 06:07.166
[Kashurra] Your actions
caused this regrettable confrontation.

06:13.583 --> 06:14.750
[Auroth] Run!

06:16.791 --> 06:18.625
[growls]

06:21.625 --> 06:23.083
[yelps]

06:25.791 --> 06:26.750
Fuck.

06:27.708 --> 06:30.208
[Kashurra] There is a cost.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.833
Death.
[growls]

06:40.625 --> 06:42.875
Bram, Dragon Knight!

06:42.958 --> 06:44.958
[heroic music playing]

06:52.875 --> 06:54.083
Auroth!

06:54.166 --> 06:55.541
[shrieks]

06:58.208 --> 06:59.708
[Auroth groans]

07:01.083 --> 07:03.041
[Auroth screams]

07:04.833 --> 07:07.166
[Auroth groaning]

07:09.083 --> 07:11.041
[Auroth moans]

07:12.291 --> 07:15.291
No more than a mouse.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.583
Auroth!
[pants]

07:22.666 --> 07:24.583
[Bram sobbing]

07:24.666 --> 07:28.833
Please. I can'tâ€¦ Tell me how to help you.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.416
[groans]

07:31.208 --> 07:35.666
I just had the most wonderful thought.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.791
[breathes heavily]

07:38.875 --> 07:39.833
[sobs]

07:39.916 --> 07:42.958
[Bram cries]

07:47.416 --> 07:48.625
[Davion] I failed.

07:48.708 --> 07:53.041
You confuse despair
with defeat, little mouse.

07:53.125 --> 07:56.291
You have not failed. You found the Eye.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.500
I didn't.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.250
[Slyrak] The Eye was merely not
what you imagined.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.875
It was not what either of us imagined.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.625
But surely,
the truth must be clear to you now.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.916
As it has become clear to me.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.541
We have been in the presence
of the Eye all along.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.166
You have known its light.
You have known its love.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.958
Love? I, I don't--

08:17.041 --> 08:20.375
[Slyrak] You think of little else.
You would kill for her.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.166
You would die for her.

08:26.875 --> 08:31.708
Her truth was shrouded in doubt.
Her light eclipsed behind the moon.

08:31.791 --> 08:33.291
"Princess of Nothing."

08:33.375 --> 08:39.625
It obscured my vision, but in your heart,
you knew from the first who she was.

08:39.708 --> 08:41.125
What she was.

08:41.208 --> 08:44.625
You stood in the gaze
of the Worldwyrm made flesh.

08:44.708 --> 08:48.208
You could not name it,
but you hewed to her side.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.541
She needs us now.

08:49.625 --> 08:54.458
She does not need us.
She must find the power within herself.

08:54.541 --> 08:58.125
[Davion] She's not going to get
the chance. You know what's out there.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.541
[Slyrak] Flesh is ephemeral.

09:00.625 --> 09:05.041
What resides in her heart is eternal,
beyond death.

09:05.125 --> 09:08.000
So, you're saying it's fine if she dies

09:08.083 --> 09:10.875
because we'll still get
what we want somehow?

09:10.958 --> 09:12.041
No.

09:12.125 --> 09:15.625
What's the point of doing all this
if none of us fucking matter?

09:15.708 --> 09:19.291
[Davion] Flesh isn't ephemeral.
Flesh is essential.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.625
Life has meaning because it's short.

09:22.708 --> 09:25.333
Because we're vulnerable, because we hurt.

09:25.416 --> 09:28.083
When we're gone, we're gone forever.

09:28.166 --> 09:31.291
It is why we fight. It's why I fight.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.416
I am asking you to do what I can't.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.333
You would have me take your place
in the Flesh Illusion?

09:38.416 --> 09:40.333
You would have me fight for her,

09:40.416 --> 09:43.833
knowing that you will almost
certainly not return to the world

09:43.916 --> 09:45.666
in your essential form?

09:45.750 --> 09:47.083
Without hesitation.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.625
[roars]

09:54.125 --> 09:56.583
[Kashurra growls]

09:56.666 --> 10:00.541
Then we will fight, little mouse.

10:00.625 --> 10:06.041
We will warm the herd.
We will shake the stars from heaven.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.083
[Bram] I wish there were more I could do.
But I know you want me to fight.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.833
-You want me to find a way.
-[knife swooshes]

10:16.583 --> 10:18.041
Sata emedu.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.791
[mystic music playing]

10:26.250 --> 10:27.500
[soldier] What is he?

10:27.583 --> 10:29.333
Can't move.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.458
-Legatus Tihomir.
-[screams]

10:32.541 --> 10:35.291
The Helio Imperium has need of a Regent.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.875
I select you.

10:37.583 --> 10:41.833
Kashurra? Huhâ€¦ How? What are you?

10:42.541 --> 10:44.791
Is my proposal acceptable?

10:44.875 --> 10:48.708
Iâ€¦ I will serve the Imperium
in any way you choose.

10:48.791 --> 10:51.541
My armies, my gold. All of it is yours.

10:51.625 --> 10:57.208
I have no need of armies or gold.
Your soldiers will secure the palace.

10:57.291 --> 11:01.250
They will bring me
Princess Mirana, untouched.

11:01.333 --> 11:05.083
No one harms my precious Sunbeam.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.083
Goddamn it, work!

11:11.041 --> 11:12.958
[grandiose music playing]

11:17.250 --> 11:18.541
Bram.

11:18.625 --> 11:19.750
Whatâ€¦

11:21.375 --> 11:23.583
Hm. Big bastard.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.750
Tell me everything.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.833
[heroic music playing]

11:31.791 --> 11:32.833
[Mirana] Move aside!

11:32.916 --> 11:35.166
That is an order from your princess!

11:35.250 --> 11:38.541
My soldiers don't take orders
from princesses.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.583
They take their orders from me,
their Regent.

11:41.666 --> 11:45.125
And my orders are to return you
to Viceroy Kashurra.

11:45.208 --> 11:48.250
Step down and surrender yourself.

11:48.333 --> 11:53.416
Please understand, if it comes to it,
you will be the first to die.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.166
Now move aside.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.208
[coughs]

12:03.291 --> 12:05.333
Sunbeam.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.208
She fought him.

12:09.291 --> 12:12.166
She saved me. It wasn't enough.

12:12.250 --> 12:16.041
Can you stand? Can you fight?
Can you help me kill that thing?

12:16.708 --> 12:17.625
Yes.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.750
Then it was enough.

12:19.833 --> 12:21.000
Where is Davion?

12:21.083 --> 12:21.958
[rumbling in distance]

12:22.041 --> 12:24.041
[Bram screams]

12:24.125 --> 12:25.875
He's right over there.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.208
The Crimson Devil himself.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.708
We share a common enemy today,
little mouse!

12:32.791 --> 12:36.916
I propose,
we slay the abomination together

12:37.000 --> 12:40.166
and save our reckoning for another time.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.416
Acceptable.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.416
To battle!

12:43.500 --> 12:45.500
[action music playing]

12:50.875 --> 12:55.708
You cannot win this fight, Princess.
Your father would have said the same.

12:55.791 --> 12:58.416
Then my father would've been wrong.

12:58.500 --> 13:03.458
I admire your spirit.
It has always brought me joy.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.875
Kill the mute. And the animal.

13:06.583 --> 13:07.750
[Sagan growls]

13:09.875 --> 13:12.625
What in the crimson dawn is that?

[grunts]

13:17.916 --> 13:19.750
[growling]

13:23.375 --> 13:28.416
You are a corruption
that imagines itself a dragon.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.833
Father of Fire.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.833
[Kashurra] I have evolved beyond you.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.666
Davion, please be in there.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.416
[Tihomir] Surrender, Princess.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.708
-Asar!
-[grunts]

14:13.791 --> 14:15.666
[horse neighs]

14:15.750 --> 14:21.500
Sun's valor! Sun's might! Sun's glory!

14:25.166 --> 14:28.541
Slaughter the traitors!
Protect the princess!

14:28.625 --> 14:30.916
[soldiers screaming]

14:31.000 --> 14:34.083
[Asar] And die knowing you stand
against the light!

14:34.166 --> 14:36.375
For the Dawn Star!

14:37.166 --> 14:42.833
[Slyrak] Three thousand years,
lost from the Thunder.

14:42.916 --> 14:47.750
You have forgotten our song.
You will submit.

14:47.833 --> 14:53.375
The Thunder is dead.
I serve the Worldwyrm. I protect the Eye.

14:53.458 --> 14:59.416
The Eye is a part of your hoard,
but it does not belong to you.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.375
We belong to it.

15:02.458 --> 15:06.083
Dragons talk too fucking much.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.625
[roars]

15:15.875 --> 15:17.208
[growls]

15:23.625 --> 15:24.708
[lightning cracks]

15:24.791 --> 15:26.875

15:26.958 --> 15:28.166
[Kaden groans]

15:33.041 --> 15:34.166
[Kaden groans]

15:34.250 --> 15:38.208
The power you've stolen through
the slaughter of dragons is impressive.

15:38.291 --> 15:42.208
But you still are a mortal man.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.708
You still have limits.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.166
[Kaden groans]

15:47.875 --> 15:50.291
I do not.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.750
[ominous music playing]

16:18.250 --> 16:20.250
[Mirana panting]

16:21.875 --> 16:24.625
They smashed it. It's over.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.041
[pounding in distance]

16:30.208 --> 16:32.083
Or you could punch a hole in the floor.

16:36.416 --> 16:37.666
[exhales deeply]

16:37.750 --> 16:41.458
When I first met you,
you needed me to protect you.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.166
And somewhere along the way,
you became this.

16:45.958 --> 16:48.208
I never asked why or how.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.208
I was only ever grateful for you.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.583
[sighs]

16:53.541 --> 16:54.958
[exhales deeply]

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
[grandiose music playing]

17:01.083 --> 17:02.041
[Fymryn] Mirana.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.375
Remember.

17:08.708 --> 17:09.958
I feel it.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.833
I remember.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.250
-[grunting]
-[screaming]

17:20.833 --> 17:23.666
I cannot allow you to pass.

17:23.750 --> 17:28.875
You are a good man, Asar.
Loyal and well-loved by our princess.

17:28.958 --> 17:31.916
I am disinclined to end your life.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.583
[Asar grunts]

17:33.666 --> 17:36.500
But do not test my admiration.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.875
And so the truth dawns.

17:47.958 --> 17:50.583
And with it,
understanding of what you are.

17:50.666 --> 17:51.875
I'm proud of you.

17:51.958 --> 17:53.500
[Mirana] I don't want your pride!

17:54.083 --> 17:55.833
I want my family back!

17:56.791 --> 17:58.916
[grunting]

18:01.416 --> 18:02.666
I am your family.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.666
[grunts]

18:10.666 --> 18:13.291
You? You are nothing.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.625
I am the Void,
the wastes between the stars,

18:16.708 --> 18:19.291
the black curtain of night
against which they burn.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.416
[Kashurra] Once, I was only a dragon.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.791
No will, no voice. I lived in darkness.

18:27.875 --> 18:32.208
By chance, I encountered strange rocks.

18:32.291 --> 18:37.208
They freed my will and gave me a voice.
They taught me their song.

18:37.291 --> 18:41.500
I learned darkness meant nothing
without the light.

18:41.583 --> 18:44.583
So I went in search of its source.

18:45.458 --> 18:50.708
Across 15 planes and countless realities,
I found one constant.

18:52.041 --> 18:54.333
The Sun in the sky.

18:54.416 --> 18:58.583
The Worldwyrm.
The awful truth became clear.

18:58.666 --> 19:01.750
All dragons are one,
interlinked with creation.

19:02.708 --> 19:07.750
I had been a part of its light,
the source, and was lured away.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.125
I was an outcast. Fallen. A hollow echo.

19:11.208 --> 19:16.208
I raged in horror and despair,
unimaginable loneliness.

19:16.291 --> 19:20.041
Until my rage brought me
to the greater truth.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.708
The Eye. The Worldwyrm made flesh.

19:24.958 --> 19:31.375
Three thousand years, I saw to her needs.
Many lifetimes, many forms. I loved her.

19:31.458 --> 19:36.666
And in those millennia,
I have loved you best.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.333
My precious Sunbeam.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.000
Youâ€¦ You don't love me.

19:43.083 --> 19:47.000
You've never loved me. You justâ€¦
You wanted me in your collection.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.458
Your hoard.

19:48.541 --> 19:52.583
I sent you away to protect you.
To serve you.

19:52.666 --> 19:55.125
Protect me? You destroyed me.

19:55.708 --> 19:59.958
I protected your throne until
you could return and protect it yourself.

20:00.958 --> 20:05.125
There awaits your seat, my Empress.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.458
Give the word and take it.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.833
Here's your word.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.041
-Now!
-[growls]

20:12.958 --> 20:13.958
[Sagan shrieks]

[tense music playing]

20:29.833 --> 20:33.000
[grunting]

20:38.833 --> 20:42.791
Poor little handmaid.
I know what it is to have no voice.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.208
To love the light
more than you love yourself.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.000
Let her go, Kashurra.

20:48.083 --> 20:52.041
But it's not enough to love the light
for the light to truly shine.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.250
The light must love you.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.041
You're killing her!

20:56.125 --> 20:59.625
To know her power,
the light must know love.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.791
And to know love,
the light must know darkness.

21:02.875 --> 21:07.625
She will love you, little handmaid.
And she will shine.

21:08.541 --> 21:09.458
Marci.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.291
Please, Kashurra! Stop!

21:14.125 --> 21:19.041
I love you. I'm sorry. I love you.
Kashurra, please!

21:25.416 --> 21:27.416
[tragic music playing]

21:32.375 --> 21:33.416
No!

21:34.916 --> 21:36.166
No!

21:39.583 --> 21:40.916
[inaudible]

21:52.875 --> 21:54.875
Sun's valor.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.583
Sun's might.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.375
Sun's glory.

22:05.875 --> 22:12.041
The Eye opens. The Eye sees.

22:18.666 --> 22:19.625
[Mirana] Marci.

22:19.708 --> 22:23.833
Marci, we won. You saved me.
You believed in me.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.750
Marci, wake up. Please?
[sobs]

22:27.833 --> 22:28.958
Please, Marci.

22:30.541 --> 22:31.750

Wake up.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.583
Oh, sweet Bram. Thank you.
[gasps]

22:57.250 --> 22:58.333
Thank you all.

[Slyrak snarls]

22:59.625 --> 23:00.666
Your Majesty.

23:01.291 --> 23:02.875
You know what awaits you.

23:02.958 --> 23:08.875
Foulfell. My battle with Terrorblade.
The beginning of the end.

23:14.250 --> 23:17.416
Tell the little mouse he is free.

23:22.083 --> 23:25.250
Slyrak. He's gone.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.166
And I'm here?

23:28.583 --> 23:29.708
You pulled me back.

23:30.458 --> 23:31.291
Mirana?

23:32.583 --> 23:34.250
-Oh, no.
-[sobs]

Turn your eyes!
Her Imperial Majesty, Mirana!

23:45.916 --> 23:48.083
Gaze into her light!

[Bram] "Solitary congregants,
reach for light we cannot see.

[guard] Halt!

25:23.333 --> 25:27.541
I have no interest in a fight.
I had to see. I had to know.

25:27.625 --> 25:30.791
I know why you've come, little Coedwin.

You are broken.
