05:01.367 --> 05:06.134
There was once in venice
a moor othello who for

05:06.339 --> 05:10.241
his merits in the affairs of war
was held in great esteem.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.640
It happened that he fell in love
with a young and noble lady

05:13.880 --> 05:15.108
called desdemona,

05:15.682 --> 05:19.709
who drawn by his virtue,
became equally enamoured of him.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.323
So it was that since her father
was much opposed to the union

05:23.323 --> 05:27.555
of desdemona with a moor,
she fled her house at night.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.621
In secret haste
they were married.

05:31.831 --> 05:36.063
Now there was in othello's
company, an ensign named lago,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.827
a very amiable outward appearance

05:39.138 --> 05:41.504
but his character was
extremely treacherous.

05:41.874 --> 05:48.245
I have told often and
i retell it again and again.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.415
I hate the moore.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.211
I'll poison his delight.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.149
How? How, lago?

05:59.292 --> 06:02.659
Proclaim him in the streets,
incense her kinsmen,

06:02.795 --> 06:07.061
and though he in fertile climate
dwell, plague him with flies.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.994
No, they come.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.735
What will i do?

06:13.473 --> 06:14.804
Why, go to bed and sleep.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.009
- I'll incontinently drown myself.
Oh, bitterness.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.606
What should i do?

06:19.746 --> 06:20.974
Put money in thy purse.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.083
Ere i would say i would drown
myself for love of a guinea

06:24.083 --> 06:26.608
hen, i would change my
humanity with a baboon!

06:33.359 --> 06:34.883
Come, be a man.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.724
Drown thyself?

06:37.864 --> 06:40.128
Drown cats and blind puppies.

06:42.001 --> 06:45.232
It cannot be that desdemona
should long continue her love

06:45.371 --> 06:47.396
to the moor or he his to her.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.742
It was a violent commencement.

06:52.478 --> 06:56.608
And thou shalt see an answerable
sequestration,

06:58.050 --> 06:59.813
put buy money in thy purse.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.118
When she is sated with his body

07:02.221 --> 07:04.246
she'll fine the error
of her choice.

07:04.457 --> 07:08.154
She must change, she must,
for youth.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.555
Your daughter!

07:14.167 --> 07:16.362
- Look, your house!
- Your house!

07:16.469 --> 07:18.232
- Your daughter!
- Your daughter!

07:18.337 --> 07:20.396
Senior, is all your family
within?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.574
Why, wherefore ask you this?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.140
Lf't be your pleasure for your
dull watch o' th' night,

07:24.277 --> 07:27.144
transported, with no worse nor
better guard but with a knave

07:27.280 --> 07:31.376
of common hire, a gondolier,
to the gross clasps of a

07:31.551 --> 07:32.779
lascivious moor.

07:32.919 --> 07:33.647
This thou shalt answer!

07:33.953 --> 07:38.686
Straight satisfy yourself, if she
be in your chamber or your house,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.790
lago, can i depend on the issue?

07:41.994 --> 07:44.053
Thou are sure of me.
Go, make money.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.921
It is too true an evil.
Gone she is.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.862
Is there not charms by which
the property of youth

07:51.003 --> 07:52.800
and maidhood may be abused?

07:53.005 --> 07:54.267
Call up all my people!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.907
Raise my kindred!

08:03.382 --> 08:04.644
Where is the moor?

08:04.851 --> 08:07.149
Keep up your bright swords
for the dew'll rust them.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.116
Oh, thou foul thief!

08:09.322 --> 08:10.755
Where hast thou stowed
my daughter?

08:10.857 --> 08:11.824
Hold your hands! Good signor,

08:11.924 --> 08:14.392
where will you that i go to
answer this your charge?

08:14.594 --> 08:16.425
To prison till fit time of law

08:16.529 --> 08:19.020
and course of direct session
call thee to answer.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.801
Now at the same hour, there
came messengers in haste

08:26.339 --> 08:28.637
to the senate for there was
news that the turkish armies

08:28.875 --> 08:31.935
were moving against the
venetian garrison in cyprus.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.673
The senators, already raised

08:34.813 --> 08:37.111
the net, elected the moor to the
commander of their troops.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.979
And officers were searching

08:39.085 --> 08:40.813
the town to apprise othello
of this honor

08:40.953 --> 08:44.183
when lo, desdemona's old
father himself brings the moor

08:44.290 --> 08:46.485
at sword's point to the council
chamber upon a charge of

08:46.626 --> 08:50.289
working from desdemona with
unlawful enchant.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.428
She was abused,

08:51.564 --> 08:54.533
stolen from me and, ay,
corrupted by magic spells.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.861
I'm very sorry for't.

08:56.502 --> 09:00.495
If she in chains of magic were not
bound, whether a maid so tender,

09:00.706 --> 09:04.343
fair and happy would ever have
to incur her general mock,

09:04.343 --> 09:05.810
run from her father

09:06.178 --> 09:09.375
to the sooty bosom of such a
fierce bat!

09:14.620 --> 09:17.487
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her!

09:17.790 --> 09:21.055
Othello, what in your own part
can you say to this?

09:21.260 --> 09:22.454
Nothing but this is so!

09:22.562 --> 09:25.622
Did you by indirect and forced

09:25.731 --> 09:27.756
courses subdue and poison
this young maid of affection?

09:30.536 --> 09:33.835
Most potent grave and
reverend signors,

09:36.409 --> 09:39.003
my very noble and approved
good masters,

09:40.179 --> 09:43.171
that i've taken away this old
man's daughter it's most true.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.413
True i have married her.

09:48.354 --> 09:52.620
The very head and front of my
offending has this extent,

09:52.792 --> 09:53.520
no more.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.260
Rude in my speech,

09:58.164 --> 10:00.257
and little blessed with the soft
phrase of peace,

10:01.067 --> 10:03.262
since these arms of mine had
seven years' pith till now some

10:03.336 --> 10:05.566
nine moon wasted they
have used their dearest action

10:05.638 --> 10:10.042
in the tented field and little
little of this great world can i

10:10.042 --> 10:12.374
speak more than pertains
to feats of broil and battle.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.509
And therefore little shall i grace
my cause in speaking of myself.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.745
Yet by your gracious patience

10:19.852 --> 10:24.289
i will round unvarnished tale
deliver of my whole course of love,

10:24.890 --> 10:26.414
what drugs, what charms,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.794
what conjuration and what

10:28.794 --> 10:30.728
mighty magic, for such
proceedings am i charged withal

10:31.097 --> 10:32.655
that i won his daughter.

10:32.865 --> 10:35.163
Her father loved me, oft

10:35.368 --> 10:37.233
invited me, still questioned me
the story of my life.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.495
I ran it through even from my

10:39.572 --> 10:41.597
boyish days wherein i speak of
the most disastrous chances

10:41.807 --> 10:44.742
of moving accidents by flood
and fields of hair-breadth

10:44.810 --> 10:47.074
scapes for the imminent
deadly breach.

10:47.613 --> 10:52.073
Of being taken by insolent foe,
and sold to slavery,

10:53.019 --> 10:57.115
of my redemption thence and
potency my travels history

10:57.857 --> 11:01.554
wherein a venturous vast and
desert idle, rough quarries,

11:02.028 --> 11:06.124
rocks and tills whose heads
touch heaven.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.291
It was my head to speak.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.261
Rest to hear, but desdemona
seriously inclined.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.575
But still the house affairs would
draw her thence, which ever as

11:17.710 --> 11:19.940
she could with haste dispatch,

11:20.146 --> 11:23.775
come again and with a greedy
ear devour up my discourse.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.609
I found good means to draw

11:28.821 --> 11:32.382
from her a prayer of earnest
heart that i would all my

11:32.591 --> 11:34.957
pilgrimage dilate, and often
did beguile her of her tears

11:35.094 --> 11:38.086
when i did speak of some
distressed stroke of my use of it.

11:38.397 --> 11:44.768
She gave me for my pains,
a world of sighs.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.270
She swore, in faith: 'twas
strange, 'twas passing strange.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.743
Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous
pitiful.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.045
She wished she had not heard

11:56.148 --> 12:00.016
it, yet she wished that
heaven made her such a man.

12:02.254 --> 12:06.054
She thanked me, and bade me
if i had a friend that loved her

12:06.659 --> 12:09.321
i should but teach him how to
tell my story

12:10.262 --> 12:11.593
and that would woo her.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.595
Upon this hint i spake,

12:13.699 --> 12:16.259
she loved my for the dangers
i had passed,

12:18.370 --> 12:20.201
and i loved her that she
did pity them.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.699
This only is the witchcraft
i have used.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.773
I think this tale would win
my daughter, too.

12:25.978 --> 12:27.275
Come hither, desdemona.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.822
Do you perceive in all this
noble company

12:38.924 --> 12:42.655
where most owe you obedience?

12:45.164 --> 12:48.463
My noble father, i do perceive
here a divided duty.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.392
To you i am bound for life
and education.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.370
My life and education both do
learn me how to respect you.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.407
You are the lord of duty.

12:58.744 --> 13:05.013
I am hitherto your daughter.
But here's my husband.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.578
And so much duty as my
mother showed to you

13:07.720 --> 13:09.483
preferring you before her father

13:09.955 --> 13:12.024
so much i challenge that i
may profess,

13:12.024 --> 13:20.454
due to the moor, my lord.
God be with you. I have done.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.534
When remedies are past
the griefs are ended.

13:22.668 --> 13:26.468
Please it your grace on to
the state affairs.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.867
The turk with a most mighty
preparation makes for cyprus.

13:29.074 --> 13:32.339
Othello, the fortitude of the
place is vast known to you.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.072
You must away this morning.

13:34.914 --> 13:35.642
With all my heart.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.976
When we consider the importance
of cyprus to the turk, we must

13:38.117 --> 13:40.779
not think the turk is so
unskillful to leave that latest

13:40.920 --> 13:42.285
which concerns them first,

13:42.421 --> 13:46.084
neglecting an attempt of ease and
gain to wake and wage a danger.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.799
Look to her, moor
if thou hast eyes to see.

13:53.799 --> 13:57.758
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.037
My life upon her faith!

14:16.622 --> 14:18.954
Mark me with what violence
she first loved the moor

14:19.058 --> 14:21.549
but for bragging and dealing
a fantastical lie.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.489
Will she love him still for prating?

14:24.730 --> 14:27.460
Ah, let not thy discreet heart
think it.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.666
- Lieutenant cassio.
- Largo

14:34.506 --> 14:35.973
what a cannon.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.005
I know my price.

14:37.142 --> 14:37.665
I'm worth no worse a place.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.209
But he, sir, had the election.

14:39.311 --> 14:42.212
And what's he? This michael
cassio, this florentine,

14:42.314 --> 14:45.681
that never set a squadron in the
field nor the division of a battle

14:45.818 --> 14:49.754
knows more than a spinster.
Yet cassio must his lieutenant

14:49.889 --> 14:53.120
be, by god bless the mark of
the fellow's ancient!

14:54.426 --> 14:55.723
Well, i would not follow him that.

14:55.928 --> 14:56.917
Oh, sir, content you.

14:57.129 --> 14:58.721
I follow him to serve my turn
upon him.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.526
Lago? Lago!

15:00.666 --> 15:01.598
Honest lago!

15:02.034 --> 15:03.399
I wake up on your lordship.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.662
My desdemona must i leave
with thee.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.500
I pray bring her after good time
to cyprus.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.869
Well, me good lord, i'll do it.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.409
The moor's of a free and
open nature, that thinks men

15:15.547 --> 15:18.744
honest that seem to be so,
and will as tenderly be led by

15:18.884 --> 15:20.408
th' nose as asses are.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.923
We cannot all be masters.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.190
Nor all masters cannot by
truly followed.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.698
You shall mark many a duteous
and knee-crooking knave who

15:35.834 --> 15:38.735
doting on his own obsequious
bondage wears out his time,

15:38.871 --> 15:41.499
much like his master's ass, for
naught but provender; and when,

15:41.607 --> 15:42.972
he's old, cashiered.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.533
Whip me such honest knaves!

15:46.045 --> 15:46.943
Others there are who, trimmed

15:47.146 --> 15:48.113
in forms and visages of duty,
keep yet their hearts attending

15:48.213 --> 15:49.180
on themselves,
and throwing but shows of

15:49.248 --> 15:51.239
services on their lords,
do well thrive by them, and when

15:51.450 --> 15:53.577
they have lined their coats
do themselves homage.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.753
These fellows have some soul,

15:56.188 --> 15:59.988
and such a one do i profess
myself for, sir, it is as sure

16:00.192 --> 16:05.994
as you're roderigo, were
i the moor, i would not be lago.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.991
In following him i follow
but myself.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.362
When my outward action doth
demonstrate the native act and

16:13.472 --> 16:16.441
figure of my heart in compliment

16:16.942 --> 16:20.241
extern, 'tis not long after but
i will wear my heart upon my

16:20.379 --> 16:28.150
sleeve, for daws to peck at.
I am not what i am.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.533
I have but an hour of love
to spend with thee.

16:52.444 --> 16:53.934
We must obey the time.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.251
Oh, lago, what tidings can
you tell of my lord?

17:41.326 --> 17:42.486
He's not yet arrived, but the

17:42.795 --> 17:46.060
turkish fleets be not enshelterd
they are drowned.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.436
It is there! I know
othello's trumpet!

18:00.512 --> 18:04.448
News, lads! News! The desperate
tempest hath so banged the turks

18:04.817 --> 18:05.909
that their designment halts.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.618
Our wars are done!

18:15.928 --> 18:23.994
He takes her by the palm.
Well said. An excellent courtship.

18:28.707 --> 18:33.735
With as little a web as this will i
ensnare as great a fly as cassio.

19:00.172 --> 19:05.474
It gives me wonder great as my
content to see you here before me.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.508
Oh, my soul's joy!

19:09.047 --> 19:12.039
If after every tempest come such

19:12.251 --> 19:14.845
calms, may the winds blow
till they have wakened death.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.555
- My dear othello!
- Oh, my fair warrior!

19:18.390 --> 19:21.757
I prattle out of fashion, and
i dote in my own comforts.

19:22.127 --> 19:24.152
- Worthy montano, your pardon
- sir

19:24.363 --> 19:26.331
good michael, look you
to the guard tonight.

19:27.599 --> 19:28.657
Come, my dear love.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.038
Once more well met at cyprus.

19:51.990 --> 19:57.360
It is othello's pleasure that
upon certain tidings now arrived

19:57.729 --> 20:01.426
importing the destruction of
the turkish fleet, every man

20:01.633 --> 20:03.294
put himself into triumph.

20:03.502 --> 20:07.495
Each man what sport and revels
his addiction lead him.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.904
For, besides these beneficial news,

20:10.042 --> 20:13.637
it is the celebration of
our general's nuptial.

20:13.745 --> 20:20.344
Heaven bless the isle of cyprus
and our noble general othello!

20:23.889 --> 20:25.857
First, i must tell thee this.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.960
Desdemona is directly
in love with him.

20:31.063 --> 20:35.193
With cassio?
Why, 'tis not possible.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.393
Her eyes must be fed.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.463
And what delight shall she
have to look on the devil?

20:42.808 --> 20:45.038
Very nature will compel her
to the second choice.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.134
Now sir, this granted,

20:46.612 --> 20:51.481
who stands so eminent in the degree
of this fortune as cassio does?

20:52.551 --> 20:53.575
Why, none! Why, none!

20:54.219 --> 20:58.451
A slipper and subtle knave,
a devilish knave!

20:59.358 --> 21:01.588
- He is handsome.
- Cassio?

21:02.494 --> 21:04.257
He has all the requisites in him

21:04.396 --> 21:08.093
that folly and green minds
look after.

21:09.801 --> 21:13.635
Oh, a pestilent complete knave

21:13.772 --> 21:16.605
and the woman hath found
him already.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.405
I cannot believe that in
desdemona.

21:28.487 --> 21:31.456
Did you not see her paddle
with the palm of his hand?

21:32.057 --> 21:33.115
Did not mark that?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.693
Yes, that i did, but that was
but a courtesy.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.693
Courtesy? Lechery. An index

21:39.164 --> 21:43.726
and obscure prologue to the
history of lust and foul thoughts.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.569
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.238
Villainous thoughts, roderigo.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.973
But, sir, be you ruled by me.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.940
Listen, listen to cassio tonight.
Watch him on the court of god.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.917
Cassio knows you not.
I'll not be far from you.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.918
Do you find some occasion
to anger him from what

22:03.255 --> 22:04.119
other course you please.

22:04.556 --> 22:05.113
Well

22:05.223 --> 22:06.884
sir, he's rash and very sudden

22:07.025 --> 22:08.890
in choler, and haply may
strike at you.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.016
Provoke him that he may,

22:10.262 --> 22:14.198
for even out of that will i
cause these of cyprus to mutiny

22:14.399 --> 22:17.994
and the displanting of cassio.
Lieutenant cassio!

22:18.937 --> 22:22.634
Lago, i'll say, you like me
well, lago?

22:22.841 --> 22:25.435
In the sincerity of
love and friendship.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.802
Come, lieutenant, a stoup of
wine!

22:28.146 --> 22:29.340
Here a brace of gallants that

22:29.648 --> 22:32.549
fain have a measure to the
health of black othello.

22:32.651 --> 22:33.982
Not tonight, good lago.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.577
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.085
Oh, just one cup.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.094
I must to the watch.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.531
Not this hour, lieutenant,
'tis not yet ten o' th' clock.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.162
Our general cast us thus early
for the love of his desdemona.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.972
He hath not yet made wanton
the night with her

22:56.074 --> 22:57.803
and she is sport for jove.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.734
She's a most exquisite lady.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.042
And full of game, i'll warrant.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.477
What an eye she has
to provocation.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.551
I object, i think right modest.

23:08.120 --> 23:17.324
Well, happiness to their sheets.
Another cup, i'll drink for you.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.624
I have drunk two cups and
i don't dare not to task

23:19.731 --> 23:21.062
my weakness with any more.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.790
My man, 'tis a night of revels.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.264
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.

23:41.553 --> 23:44.522
If it were now to die, 'twere
now to be most happy,

23:44.723 --> 23:46.884
for i fear my soul hath her content

23:47.292 --> 23:51.058
so absolute that not another
comfort like to this

23:51.263 --> 24:13.347
succeeds in unknown fate.
Ah, brothers on call tonight!

24:14.586 --> 24:16.178
God, an excellent song!

24:16.855 --> 24:17.981
I learned it in england, where

24:18.190 --> 24:20.590
indeed they are most potent
in potting.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.285
Your dane, your german,

24:23.428 --> 24:26.022
and your swag-bellied hollander
- drink, ho! -

24:26.164 --> 24:27.426
are nothing to your english.

24:28.066 --> 24:30.660
Is your englishman so exquisite
in his drinking?

24:30.769 --> 24:32.828
He drinks you with facility
you dane dead drunk,

24:33.939 --> 24:36.100
he sweats not to overthrow
your almain,

24:36.308 --> 24:39.471
he gives your hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.102
To the health of our general!

24:41.313 --> 24:43.611
I am for it, lieutenant, and
i'll do you justice.

25:31.496 --> 25:35.262
Good faith, a little one,
not past a pint, as i'm a soldier.

26:08.400 --> 26:13.565
Well, god above all
and there be souls must be saved,

26:14.272 --> 26:16.672
and there be souls must not
be saved.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.072
It's true, good lieutenant.

26:18.176 --> 26:22.408
For mine own part, no offense

26:24.716 --> 26:28.413
to the general, nor any man
of quality, i hope to be saved.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.856
Ay, but, by your leave,
not before me.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.163
Do not think, gentlemen,
i am drunk.

26:40.999 --> 26:46.631
This is my ancient, my right
hand, this is my left.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.797
I am not drunk now. I can
stand well enough, and

26:51.610 --> 26:52.440
i speak well enough.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.341
Excellent well!

26:54.446 --> 26:58.075
Very well. You must not think
then that i am drunk.

27:06.524 --> 27:09.618
Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!

27:13.598 --> 27:14.326
What noise is this?

27:14.532 --> 27:18.127
A knave teach me my duty?

27:19.971 --> 27:20.869
What's the matter, lieutenant?

27:21.006 --> 27:23.338
I'll beat the knave into
a twiggen bottle.

27:38.356 --> 27:39.288
Away, i say.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.255
Go out and cry a mutiny!

27:41.693 --> 27:51.796
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!

28:02.781 --> 28:03.679
Stop, lieutenant!

28:03.882 --> 28:05.747
Hold this shame forever!

28:05.850 --> 28:07.943
Have you forgot all place of
sense and duty?

28:08.086 --> 28:09.144
Hold the rage!

28:36.314 --> 28:37.474
Hold, gentlemen!

28:42.454 --> 28:45.685
You're ordered above.
Yeah, move, come on!

28:45.957 --> 28:47.891
Why, sir, the generals!

29:17.021 --> 29:18.511
Silence that dreadful bell!

29:20.992 --> 29:22.892
Who began this? Lago.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.789
I do not know.

29:25.130 --> 29:30.659
Friends all, but now, even now,
in quarter and terms like

29:31.236 --> 29:33.704
bride and groom devesting
them for bed,

29:34.372 --> 29:37.864
but now swords out and tilting
one at other's breasts.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.834
Worthy montano, what's the matter

29:41.112 --> 29:43.648
that you unlace your
reputation thus and spend your

29:43.648 --> 29:46.208
rich opinion for the name
of a night-brawler?

29:46.484 --> 29:51.285
Your officer, lago, can
inform you.

29:51.656 --> 29:52.816
Fortunate. Town of war to manage
private and domestic quarrel?

29:53.224 --> 29:55.124
In night, and on the court
and guard of safety?

29:57.929 --> 30:00.159
Lago, who began't?

30:00.431 --> 30:02.865
Thou dost deliver more or less
than truth, thou art no soldier.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.935
I had rather have this tongue
cut from my mouth than it should

30:05.036 --> 30:07.402
do offense to michael cassio.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.199
Sir, men in rage strike those
that wish them best,

30:11.309 --> 30:14.176
yet surely cassio i believe
received from him that fled

30:14.946 --> 30:17.608
some strange dignity, which
patience could not pass.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.613
I know, lago, the honesty
and love doth mince this matter,

30:22.687 --> 30:23.984
making it light to cassio.

30:25.590 --> 30:32.553
Cassio, i love thee,
but never more be officer of mine.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.158
Look if my gentle love be not
raised up.

30:36.034 --> 30:37.365
I'll make thee an example.

31:19.477 --> 31:24.779
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Ay, past all surgery.

31:25.316 --> 31:26.908
Marry, heaven forbid!

31:27.118 --> 31:30.383
Reputation, reputation,
reputation!

31:30.688 --> 31:32.986
O, i have lost my reputation!

31:33.424 --> 31:35.619
I have lost the immortal part
of myself,

31:35.760 --> 31:36.818
and what remains is bestial.

31:36.928 --> 31:39.192
My reputation, lago,
my reputation.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.027
Reputation oft got without
merit and lost without deserving.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.769
I tell you what you shall do.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.236
Our general's wife is
now the general.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.806
Confess yourself freely to her.

31:50.108 --> 31:54.272
Desdemona is of so free, so
kind, so blessed a disposition

31:54.412 --> 31:57.142
she holds it a vice in her
goodness not to do more than

31:57.248 --> 31:58.237
she is requested.

32:00.785 --> 32:02.082
Farewell, lieutenant.

32:11.696 --> 32:12.720
Roderigo.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.657
My money is almost spent,

32:16.801 --> 32:19.793
i have been tonight exceedingly
well cudgeled.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.694
And i think the issue will be,

32:22.140 --> 32:25.109
i shall have so much experience
for my pains, and so, with

32:25.209 --> 32:29.873
no money at all, and a little
more wit, return again to venice.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.050
How poor are they that
have not patience!

32:33.685 --> 32:34.777
Does not go well?

32:35.853 --> 32:38.515
Cassio has beaten thee, and
thou by that small hurt hath

32:38.623 --> 32:40.352
cashiered cassio.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.789
Content thyself awhile.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.387
For whiles this honest fool
plies desdemona to repair

32:45.496 --> 32:48.124
his fortune, and she for him
pleads strongly to the moor.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.464
Io, by how much she strives

32:50.568 --> 32:52.433
to do him good, she shall
undo her credit with the moor.

32:53.037 --> 32:56.598
So will i turn her virtue into pitch,
and out of her own

32:56.708 --> 33:00.109
goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all.

33:43.821 --> 33:44.845
Do not doubt, cassio.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.581
I'll have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were.

33:47.725 --> 33:50.956
Madam, whatever shall become
of michael cassio, he's never

33:51.095 --> 33:53.427
anything but your true servant.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.865
Ha! I like not that.

33:56.000 --> 33:56.728
What dost thou say?

33:56.934 --> 33:59.664
Nothing, my lord, or if,
i know not what.

34:00.438 --> 34:01.496
How now, my lord?

34:02.106 --> 34:03.835
I have been talking with
a suitor here.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.873
A man that languishes in
your displeasure.

34:06.010 --> 34:06.772
Who is't you mean?

34:06.844 --> 34:07.936
Why, your lieutenant cassio.

34:08.312 --> 34:09.179
Went he hence now?

34:09.179 --> 34:12.114
I' sooth so humbled that he hath
left part of his grief with me

34:12.315 --> 34:13.146
to suffer with him.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.476
Good love, call him back.

34:14.585 --> 34:15.483
Some other time.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.779
- Shall't be shortly?
- The sooner, sweet, for you.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.413
- Shall't be tonight at supper?
- No, not tonight.

34:20.525 --> 34:20.991
Tomorrow dinner then?

34:21.225 --> 34:22.393
I shall not dine at home.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.951
I meet the captains
at the citadel.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.426
Why then, tomorrow night.
I prithee name the time.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.327
No more. Let him come
when he will.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.495
I will deny thee nothing.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.871
Whereon i do beseech thee

34:37.341 --> 34:39.434
grant me this to leave me
but a little to myself.

34:39.643 --> 34:44.980
Shall i deny you? No.
Farewell, my lord.

34:50.353 --> 34:53.083
- My noble lord.
- What dost thou say, lago?

34:54.992 --> 34:57.426
Did michael cassio, when you
wooed my lady,

34:57.528 --> 34:58.552
know of your love?

34:59.430 --> 35:02.695
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?

35:03.201 --> 35:06.136
But for a satisfaction of my
thought, no further harm.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.138
Why of thy thought, lago?

35:09.006 --> 35:11.201
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.034
O, yes, and went between us
very oft.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.770
- Indeed?
- Indeed? Ay, indeed.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.941
Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

35:23.187 --> 35:26.281
- Honest, my lord?
- Honest? Ay, honest!

35:26.924 --> 35:28.414
My lord, for aught i know.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.184
What dost thou think?

35:31.362 --> 35:32.226
Think, my lord?

35:32.830 --> 35:35.822
Think. Thou dost mean something.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.461
I heard thee say even now,
thou lik'st not that,

35:38.569 --> 35:40.036
when cassio left my wife.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.466
If thou dost love me
show me thou thought.

35:46.611 --> 35:47.839
My lord, you know i love you.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.506
I think thou dost.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.517
For michael cassio, i dare

35:56.254 --> 36:01.214
be sworn, i think he is honest.
I think so, too.

36:05.196 --> 36:07.096
Men should be what they seem.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.324
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

36:10.968 --> 36:13.459
Why then, i think cassio's
an honest man.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.830
Nay, yet there's more in this?

36:19.844 --> 36:23.507
I prithee speak to me as
to thy thinkings.

36:25.816 --> 36:27.249
Good name in man and woman,

36:27.885 --> 36:31.719
dear my lord, is the immediate
jewel of their souls.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.921
Who steals my purse steals
trash; 'this something, nothing.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.291
Twas mine, 'tis his, and has
been slave to thousands.

36:40.231 --> 36:43.257
But he that flinches from me
my good name robs me of

36:43.734 --> 36:48.000
that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed.

36:48.072 --> 36:49.437
By heaven, i'll know
thy thoughts.

36:49.540 --> 36:53.203
Beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster,

36:53.277 --> 36:55.108
which doth mock the meat
it feeds on.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.408
That cuckold lives in bliss
who, certain of his fate,

36:57.615 --> 36:58.445
loves not his wronger.

36:58.649 --> 37:02.517
But o, what damned minutes
tells he over who dotes,

37:02.887 --> 37:07.153
yet doubts, suspects,
yet fondly loves!

37:08.092 --> 37:09.923
Why? Why is this?

37:11.729 --> 37:14.562
Think'st thou i'd make a life of

37:15.066 --> 37:17.534
jealousy to follow still the
changes of the moon with

37:17.735 --> 37:23.696
fresh suspicions?
No, lago, i'll see before i doubt.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.173
When i doubt, prove.
I speak not yet of proof.

37:27.778 --> 37:32.613
Look to your wife.
Observe her well with cassio.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.888
I know our country disposition
well.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.760
In venice they do let heaven

37:51.869 --> 37:53.700
see the pranks they dare not
show their husbands.

37:53.838 --> 37:57.433
Their best conscience is not to
leave't undone but kept unknown.

37:57.642 --> 37:58.700
Dost thou say so?

37:58.909 --> 38:01.070
She did deceive her father,
marrying you.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.543
And when she seemed to shake
and fear your looks,

38:02.680 --> 38:03.612
she loved them most.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.414
And so she did.

38:05.549 --> 38:10.179
Why, go to then! She that so
young could give out such a

38:10.354 --> 38:13.517
seeming to seel her father's
eyes up close as oak.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.387
He thought 'twas witchcraft.
But i am much to blame.

38:17.528 --> 38:20.361
I humbly do beseech you of my
pardon for too much loving you.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.261
I'm bound to thee forever.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.907
I see this hath a little
dashed your spirit.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.144
Not a jot, not a jot.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.379
Trust me, i fear it has.

38:44.455 --> 38:48.323
I hope you will consider what
is spoke comes from my love.

38:49.226 --> 38:50.887
Cassio's my worthy friend.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.221
My lord, i see you're moved!

38:53.764 --> 38:56.790
No, not much moved.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.830
I do not think but
desdemona's honest.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.871
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.879
And yet, how nature erring
from itself

39:11.949 --> 39:14.110
ay, there's the point, as to

39:14.218 --> 39:18.314
be bold with you, not to
affect many proposed matches

39:18.689 --> 39:21.715
of her own clime, complexion,
and degree.

39:22.927 --> 39:28.092
One may smell in such a will
most rank, foul disproportions,

39:28.766 --> 39:29.926
thought unnatural.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.737
My lord, i would i might entreat
your honor to scan this thing

39:39.877 --> 39:41.276
no further. Leave it to time.

39:41.712 --> 39:42.736
Farewell.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.139
Leave me, lago.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.152
How now, my dear othello?

39:54.425 --> 39:56.154
My lord, i take my leave.

39:59.797 --> 40:00.991
Are you not well?

40:02.433 --> 40:04.492
I have a pain upon my
forehead here.

40:04.635 --> 40:05.795
Why, that's with watching.

40:05.936 --> 40:06.903
It will away again.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.266
Let me but bind it hard, within
hours it will be well.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.672
Your napkin is too little.
Let it alone!

41:15.773 --> 41:17.070
I have a thing for you.

41:17.174 --> 41:17.833
You have a thing for me?

41:17.975 --> 41:20.535
It is a common thing to
have a foolish wife.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.406
O, is that all? What will you

41:21.545 --> 41:23.843
give me now for that
same handkerchief?

41:24.048 --> 41:24.673
What handkerchief?

41:24.782 --> 41:26.977
That which so often you
did bid me to steal.

41:27.117 --> 41:27.845
Give it me.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.350
If it be not for some purpose
of import, give't me again.

41:30.721 --> 41:31.847
Poor lady, she'll run mad.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.823
I have use for it. Leave me.

42:04.588 --> 42:05.384
How now, general?

42:05.456 --> 42:07.048
I swear 'tis better to be much

42:07.124 --> 42:08.091
abused than but to
know't a little.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.919
- My lord!
- Is my lord angry?

42:10.127 --> 42:13.153
He went hence but now, and
certainly in strange unquietness.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.491
- I will go seek him.
- I prithee do so.

42:15.599 --> 42:18.067
There's matter in't indeed
if he be angry.

42:26.911 --> 42:30.438
Villain, be sure thou prove
my love a whore, be sure of it!

42:32.383 --> 42:33.816
Give me the ocular proof,

42:34.251 --> 42:36.719
or, by the worth of mine eternal
soul, thou hadst been better

42:36.787 --> 42:38.345
have been born a dog than
answer my waked wrath!

42:38.489 --> 42:38.978
Is't come to this?

42:39.123 --> 42:41.318
Make me to see't, or at the
least so prove it that

42:41.392 --> 42:44.020
the probation bear no hinge
nor loop to hang a doubt on

42:44.361 --> 42:45.760
or woe upon thy life!

42:46.397 --> 42:48.957
Never pray more,
abandon all remorse.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.964
For nothing canst thou to
damnation add greater than that.

42:52.036 --> 42:53.003
O monstrous world!

42:53.070 --> 42:54.628
Take note, take note, o world!

42:54.838 --> 42:56.396
To be direct and honest
is not safe.

42:56.507 --> 43:04.004
By the world i think my wife
be honest, and think she is not.

43:04.648 --> 43:08.584
I think that thou art just, and
think thou art not.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.244
I'll have some proof. Her name,

43:12.056 --> 43:16.220
that was as fresh as dian's
visage, is now begrimed and

43:16.427 --> 43:20.329
black as mine own face.

43:20.965 --> 43:22.455
Would i were satisfied!

43:22.666 --> 43:24.099
How satisfied, my lord?

43:24.201 --> 43:28.035
Would you, the supervisor,
grossly gape on?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.233
Behold her topped?

43:33.644 --> 43:35.805
It is impossible you should
see this.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.143
Were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkey?

43:39.283 --> 43:41.843
Give me a living reason
she's disloyal!

43:43.587 --> 43:46.522
I lay with cassio lately, and
being trouble with a raging

43:46.790 --> 43:47.552
tooth, i could not sleep.

43:47.658 --> 43:50.650
There are a kind of men so loose
or should that in their sleeps

43:50.761 --> 43:52.194
will mutter their affairs.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.355
One of this kind is cassio.

43:55.099 --> 43:57.795
In sleep i heard him say,

43:58.302 --> 44:03.433
sweet desdemona, let us
be wary, let us hid our loves.

44:03.841 --> 44:06.241
And then, sir, would he gripe
and wring my hand, cry

44:06.310 --> 44:08.369
o sweet creature! Then kiss

44:08.445 --> 44:11.107
me hard as if he plucked up
kisses by the roots that grew

44:11.181 --> 44:15.277
upon my lips, laid his leg o'er
my thigh, and sigh, and kiss

44:15.586 --> 44:17.918
and then cry, cursed fate
that gave thee to the moor!

44:18.022 --> 44:20.388
I'll tear her all to pieces!

44:20.457 --> 44:23.585
Tell me but this. Have you not
sometimes seen a handkerchief

44:23.727 --> 44:25.786
spotted with strawberries in
your wife's hand?

44:25.996 --> 44:27.020
I gave her such a one.

44:27.097 --> 44:30.157
Such a handkerchief, i'm sure
it was your wife's, did i today

44:30.267 --> 44:32.098
see cassio wipe his face.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.604
If it be that

44:35.673 --> 44:37.800
if it be that, or any that was

44:38.676 --> 44:40.940
hers, it speaks against her
with the other proofs.

44:43.814 --> 44:46.180
Now do i see 'tis true.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.917
O, that the slave had
forty thousand lives!

44:53.023 --> 44:53.546
One is too poor, too week
for my revenge!

44:55.626 --> 44:58.993
- Yet be content!
- Blood, blood, blood!

44:59.296 --> 45:03.130
Patience, i say.
Your mind may change.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.669
Never, lago. Like to the pontiac

45:05.669 --> 45:08.502
sea, whose icy current and
compulsive course nev'r keeps

45:10.274 --> 45:11.969
retiring ebb, but keeps due on
to the propontic and the

45:12.042 --> 45:12.599
hellespont.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.470
Even so my bloody thoughts,

45:14.611 --> 45:18.047
with violent pace, shall nev'r
look back, nev'r ebb to humble

45:18.182 --> 45:21.674
love, till that a capable and
wide revenge swallow them up.

45:21.752 --> 45:24.915
Witness that here lago doth
give up the execution of

45:25.222 --> 45:27.520
his wit, hands, heart to
wronged othello's service.

45:27.658 --> 45:28.750
Within these three days let me

45:28.826 --> 45:31.294
here thee say that
cassio's not alive.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.522
My friend is dead. 'tis done
at your request.

45:35.799 --> 45:36.959
But let her live.

45:37.101 --> 45:38.466
Damn her, lewd minx!

45:39.536 --> 45:41.060
O, damn her!

45:46.076 --> 45:50.137
Now art thou my lieutenant.

45:50.714 --> 45:53.114
I am your own forever.

46:14.738 --> 46:16.569
Cassio! Cassio!

46:55.646 --> 46:56.772
Give me your hand.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.081
This hand is moist, my lady.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.344
It hath felt no age nor
known no sorrow.

47:04.421 --> 47:10.587
This argues fruitfulness and
liberal heart. Hot, hot and most.

47:11.595 --> 47:13.961
'Tis a good hand, a frank one.

47:14.064 --> 47:16.089
You may, indeed, say so
for 'twas that hand that

47:16.200 --> 47:17.258
gave away my heart.

47:17.367 --> 47:18.629
A liberal hand.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.303
Come now, your promise.

47:20.404 --> 47:23.202
- What promise, chuck?
- Let cassio be received again.

47:28.745 --> 47:30.076
Lend me thy handkerchief.

47:30.480 --> 47:31.640
I have it not about me.

47:32.049 --> 47:33.676
- Not?
- No, indeed, my lord.

47:33.817 --> 47:34.875
That's a fault. That handkerchief

47:35.018 --> 47:37.043
did an egyptian to my mother
give.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.111
The worms were hallowed that
did breed the silk.

47:39.323 --> 47:40.790
Then would to god that
i had never seen't.

47:41.158 --> 47:44.286
Is't lost? Is't gone?
Speak, is it out of the way?

47:44.661 --> 47:46.390
It is not lost.
But what an if it were?

47:46.597 --> 47:47.393
How?

47:47.865 --> 47:49.856
I say it is not lost.

47:50.234 --> 47:51.724
Fetch't, let me see it!

47:51.902 --> 47:53.961
Why, so i can, but i will
not now.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.297
This is a trick to put me
from my suit.

47:56.573 --> 47:58.234
Pray you let cassio
be received again.

47:58.408 --> 48:00.808
- The handkerchief!
- I pray talking of cassio

48:01.078 --> 48:01.567
the handkerchief!

48:01.812 --> 48:04.542
A man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love,

48:04.815 --> 48:06.680
- shares dangers with you
- the handkerchief!

48:06.917 --> 48:09.181
Come, come, you'll never
meet a more sufficient man.

48:09.419 --> 48:17.326
Away. Away!
Away!

48:19.129 --> 48:21.256
Cassio, this handkerchief.
Whose is it?

48:21.531 --> 48:23.829
I found it here.
I like the work well.

48:24.101 --> 48:26.296
'Tis very good!
Shall i see you soon at night?

48:26.403 --> 48:28.305
I will see you soon, bianca.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.933
- Come, lieutenant.
- Cassio, handkerchief.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.800
Take it. Have it copied
thee made for it.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.081
Tell you yet once more,

48:40.350 --> 48:43.979
importune desdemona to
put you in your place again.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.954
Sure there's some wonder
in this handkerchief.

48:50.694 --> 48:52.958
'Tis a year or two shows
us a man.

48:53.230 --> 48:56.290
They're all but stomachs,
and we all but food. Cassio!

48:56.867 --> 49:02.328
They eat us hungerly, and
when they're full, they belch us.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.942
How now, good cassio?
What's the news with you?

49:17.454 --> 49:21.413
What trumpet is that same?
Something from venice.

49:39.843 --> 49:41.970
My noble lord, whilest you
were here, overwhelmed with

49:42.245 --> 49:45.146
your grief, cassio came hither.
I shifted him aways, bade him

49:45.382 --> 49:48.112
anon return, and
here speak with me.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.279
Mark the fleers, the gibes,

49:50.487 --> 49:53.354
and notable scorns that dwell
in every region of his face.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.293
For i will make him tell
the tale anew,

49:57.427 --> 50:00.396
where, how, how oft, how
long ago, and when he hath

50:00.564 --> 50:02.794
and is again to cope your wife.

50:08.171 --> 50:10.139
I say, but mark his gesture.

50:10.440 --> 50:13.204
Marry patience, or i shall say
you're all in all in spleen,

50:13.410 --> 50:15.605
and nothing of a man.
Dost thou hear, lago?

50:15.979 --> 50:18.675
I will be found most cunning
in my patience.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.783
But - dost thou hear? - 
most bloody.

50:25.055 --> 50:27.649
- How do you know, lieutenant?
- Lago.

50:28.658 --> 50:31.058
Now, if this suit lay in bianca's
power,

50:31.261 --> 50:33.092
how quickly should you speed!

50:33.363 --> 50:34.853
Alas, poor caitiff!

50:36.500 --> 50:39.333
I never knew woman love
man so.

50:39.569 --> 50:43.130
She gives it out that
you shall marry her.

50:43.306 --> 50:45.900
Ay!

50:52.883 --> 50:55.977
I was talking on the sea bank,
and the bauble falls me thus

50:56.186 --> 50:58.086
about my neck

50:58.722 --> 51:01.282
so hangs, and lolls, and
weeps upon me,

51:01.591 --> 51:03.388
so shakes and pulls me!

51:03.493 --> 51:06.360
- Cassio!
- I must leave her company.

51:06.730 --> 51:10.427
What did you mean by that same
handkerchief you gave me even now?

51:11.001 --> 51:13.561
A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your

51:13.770 --> 51:14.862
chamber and know not who
left i t there!

51:15.272 --> 51:16.239
This is some minx's token.

51:16.540 --> 51:18.030
I'll take out no work on't.

51:18.341 --> 51:20.036
Now now, my sweet bianca?
How now?

51:20.210 --> 51:21.541
After her! After her!

51:27.350 --> 51:29.978
Did you see how he laughed
at his vice?

51:30.754 --> 51:31.721
O lago.

51:32.122 --> 51:33.384
Did you see the handkerchief?

51:34.224 --> 51:35.816
Was that mine?

51:36.626 --> 51:40.153
Desdemona gave it him, and
he hath giv'n it his whore.

51:50.540 --> 51:54.909
I had been happy if the general
camp, pioners and all, had

51:55.178 --> 51:57.078
tasted her sweet body.

51:57.514 --> 52:00.540
So i had nothing known.

52:01.618 --> 52:05.145
What sense had i of her
stolen hours of lust?

52:05.655 --> 52:08.920
I saw it not, it harmed me not.

52:09.459 --> 52:12.826
I slept the next night well,
was free and merry!

52:14.131 --> 52:18.295
I found not cassio's kisses
on her lips.

52:23.773 --> 52:29.109
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman.

52:36.186 --> 52:37.414
Nay, you must forget that.

52:37.587 --> 52:40.954
Ay, let her rot and perish,
and be damned.

52:41.391 --> 52:47.728
No, my heart is turned to stone.
I strike it and it hurts my hand.

52:49.599 --> 52:52.159
O, the world hath not a
sweeter creature!

52:54.237 --> 52:58.970
She might lie by an emperor's
side and command him tasks.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.209
Nay, that's not your way.

53:02.479 --> 53:06.575
Hang her! I do but say
what she is.

53:09.386 --> 53:11.013
So delicate with her needle.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.880
An admirable musician.

53:15.592 --> 53:19.153
O, she will sing the savageness
out of a bear.

53:19.930 --> 53:22.922
Of so high and plenteous
wit and invention

53:23.200 --> 53:25.065
she's the worse for all this.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.632
O, a thousand, a thousand
times.

53:28.972 --> 53:30.906
Of so gentle a condition?

53:31.107 --> 53:32.267
Ay, too gentle.

53:32.609 --> 53:37.512
Nay, that's certain.
Yet the pity of it, lago.

53:39.082 --> 53:43.485
O lago, the pity of it, lago.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.583
I will chop her into messes!

53:47.057 --> 53:48.786
Cuckold me!

54:02.906 --> 54:04.237
- Will you think so?
- Think so, lago?

54:04.374 --> 54:06.399
- What, to kiss in private?
- An unauthorized kiss?

54:06.676 --> 54:09.167
Or to be naked with her
friend in bed an hour or more

54:09.412 --> 54:10.936
not meaning any harm.

54:11.481 --> 54:12.641
Naked in bed?

54:12.882 --> 54:13.678
But if i give my wife
a handkerchief

54:13.917 --> 54:14.611
what then?

54:14.784 --> 54:17.048
Why, then 'tis hers, my lord,
and being hers shy may,

54:17.220 --> 54:18.152
i think, bestow't on any man.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.017
By heaven, i would most
gladly have forgot it!

54:20.257 --> 54:21.849
He had my handkerchief!

54:22.058 --> 54:23.491
- Ay, what of that?
- That's not so good now.

54:23.727 --> 54:25.888
What if i had said i had seen
him do you wrong?

54:26.196 --> 54:27.857
- Or heard him say
- hath he said anything?

54:28.231 --> 54:29.858
He hath, my lord, but
no more than

54:30.100 --> 54:30.532
what hath he said?

54:30.734 --> 54:34.431
That he did i know not what he did
what? What?

54:35.405 --> 54:37.066
Lie.

54:40.477 --> 54:41.808
Lie with her?

54:42.145 --> 54:46.673
With her, on her, what you will.

55:30.860 --> 55:32.293
Damnation!

55:32.762 --> 55:35.390
My lord, i say, othello!

55:49.512 --> 55:50.706
Dost thou mock me?

55:50.847 --> 55:54.874
I mock you not, by heaven.

56:32.188 --> 56:40.027
O now for ever farewell
the tranquil mind.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.390
Farewell content.

56:47.103 --> 56:50.095
Farewell the plumed troops,
and the big wars that make

56:50.473 --> 56:54.876
ambition virtue. O farewell!

56:55.779 --> 56:58.839
Farewell the neighing steed and
the shrill trump,

56:59.716 --> 57:04.551
the spirit-stirring drum,
th'ear-piercing fife, the royal

57:04.687 --> 57:11.024
banner, and all quality,
pride, pomp, and circumstance,

57:11.261 --> 57:13.729
of glorious war.

57:15.365 --> 57:19.802
And o you mortal engines
whose rude throats the immortal

57:19.969 --> 57:23.132
jove's dread clamors
counterfeit.

57:26.042 --> 57:29.500
Farewell! Othello's occupation's
gone!

58:09.953 --> 58:12.649
- God save you, worthy general.
- Pray you.

58:18.595 --> 58:21.621
The duke and the senators
of venice greet you.

58:22.532 --> 58:25.433
I kiss the instrument of
their pleasures.

58:39.482 --> 58:42.110
Is there division 'twixt my lord
and cassio?

58:42.285 --> 58:45.413
A most unhappy one, i would
do much t' atome them,

58:45.588 --> 58:47.488
for the love i bear to cassio.

58:48.024 --> 58:49.252
My lord?

58:49.492 --> 58:51.687
May be th' letter moved him,
for, i think, they do command

58:51.861 --> 58:53.556
him home, deputing cassio
in his government.

58:53.796 --> 58:56.230
- Trust me, i am glad on it.
- Indeed?

58:59.469 --> 59:04.998
- Why, sweet othello
- devil! Out of my way!

59:05.608 --> 59:06.632
I will not stay to offend you.

59:06.809 --> 59:08.367
Truly an obedient lady.

59:09.012 --> 59:10.912
I do beseech your lordship
call her back.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.342
- Mistress!
- My lord!

59:12.549 --> 59:13.516
What would you do with her, sir?

59:13.883 --> 59:14.850
Who? I, my lord?

59:15.351 --> 59:16.318
You did wish that i would make
her turn.

59:16.452 --> 59:21.253
Sir, she can turn, and turn,
and yet go on and turn again,

59:21.591 --> 59:22.751
and she can weep, sir, weep.

59:23.126 --> 59:25.651
And she's obedient, as you say,
obedient. Very obedient.

59:25.929 --> 59:28.022
Proceed you in your tears.

59:28.998 --> 59:30.226
Concerning this, sir

59:30.967 --> 59:35.836
o well-painted passion!
I am commanded home.

59:36.606 --> 59:41.407
Get you away, i'll send
for you anon.

59:45.448 --> 59:50.385
Sir, i obey the mandate and
will return to venice.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.154
Cassio shall have my place.

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.395
You are welcome, sir,
to cyprus.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:14.340
Goats and monkeys!

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.309
Is he not light of brain?

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.151
He's that he is.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.643
Let me see your eyes.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.651
Look in my face.

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:13.164
Why, what art thou?

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.137
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:20.734
Had it pleased heaven to try me
with affliction, had they rained

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:25.209
all kinds of sores and shames
on my bare head, steeped me

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:29.112
in poverty to the very lips,
given to captivity me and

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.512
my utmost hopes.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:37.722
I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop of patinece

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:43.858
but, alas, to make me the fixed
figure for the time of scorn

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:46.731
to point his slow and moving
finger at.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.101
Yet could i bear that too, well,
very well.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:58.603
But there where i have garnered
up my heart, where either

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:04.219
i must live or bear no life,
the fountain from the which my

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:14.352
current runs or else dries up,
to be discarded thence, or

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:19.367
keep it as a cistern for foul
toads to knot and gender in.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.867
I hope my noble lord
esteems me honest.

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:26.402
O, ay, as summer flies are
in the shambles, that quicken

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.206
even with blowing.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:37.385
O, thou weed, who art so
lovely fair, and smell'st so

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:42.521
sweet, that the sense aches
at thee, would thou hadst

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.763
never been born!

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.760
Alas, what ignorant sin
have i committed?

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:58.501
Committed? A thou public
commoner, i should make very

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:01.643
forges of my cheeks that would
to cinders burn up modestly.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:04.575
Did i but speak thy deeds.
What committed?

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:07.442
Heaven stops the nose at it,
and the moon winks,

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.676
the bawdy wind that kisses all
it meets is hushed within the

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:15.187
hollow mine of earth and
will not hear't. What committed?

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:23.599
- Are not you a strumpet?
- By heaven you do me wrong!

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:27.430
- Are not you a strumpet?
- No, as i am a christian!

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.763
- Is't possible?
- O heaven forgive us!

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.768
I cry you mercy then.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.602
I took you for that cunning
whore of venice that married with othello

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.275
how do you, madam?

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.845
How do you, my good lady?

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.551
Faith, half asleep.

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:18.152
Good madam, what's the
matter with my lord?

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.343
With who?

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.785
Why, with my lord, madam.

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:25.954
Who is thy lord?

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.925
He that is yours, sweet lady.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:33.665
I have none. Do not talk
to me, emilia.

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:38.532
I cannot weep, nor answers have
i none, but what should go by water

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:50.112
prithee tonight lay on my
wedding sheets, remember.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:41.196
Get me some poison, lago,
this night.

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:46.331
I'll not expostulate with her,
lest her body and beauty

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:48.837
unprovide my mind again.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.806
Do it not with poison.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:56.779
Strangle her in her bed, even
the bed she hath contaminated.

01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:00.080
Good, good! The justice of
it pleases.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:04.826
And for cassio, let me be
his undertaker.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.924
Excellent good!

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:11.062
You shall hear more by midnight.

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:32.586
A halter pardon him!

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.887
And hell gnaw his ones!

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.116
Who should he call her whore?

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.358
Who keeps her company?

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:41.955
What time? What place?

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:45.960
What form? What likelihood?

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.799
The moor's abused by some
most villainous knave,

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:51.202
some base notorious knave,
some scurvy fellow!

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.807
Speak within doors.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.937
Some such squire he was
that turned your wit the steamy

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:59.343
side without and made you to
suspect me with the moor.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:00.949
Desdemona.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.083
Get you to bed.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.428
Dismiss your attendant there.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.260
Look't be done.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.263
I do not find that thou deal'st
justly with me.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.626
What in the contrary?

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.997
Every day thou daff'st me
with some device, lago.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.500
I have wasted myself out of
my means.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.635
The jewels you have had from
me to deliver desdemona would

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.572
half have corrupted a votarist.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.075
You have tole me she hath
received them, and returned

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.215
me expectations and comforts
of sudden respect and

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.375
acquaintance, but i find none.

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.020
Very well. Go to.

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:48.622
I cannot go to, man,
nor 'tis not very well.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.291
I will make myself known
to desdemona.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.761
She will return me my jewels.

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:59.197
If not, i will seek satisfaction
of you.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.428
Now i see there's a mettle
in thee, and even from this

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.540
instant do build on thee a
better opinion than ever before.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.843
Give me thy hand, roderigo.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:15.615
I protest i have dealt
mostly directly in thy affair.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.986
It hath not appeared.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:22.017
I grant thee it hath not appeared,
and your suspicion is not

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.160
without wit and judgment.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:29.326
If thou hast that in thee indeed
which i have greater reason

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.194
to believe now than ever,

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:37.334
i mean purpose, courage, and
valor, this night prove it.

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:44.310
If thou the next night following
enjoy not desdemona,

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.510
take me from this world
with treachery.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:04.756
There is especial commission
come from venice to depute

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.232
cassio in othello's place.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:11.801
Why, then othello and desdemona
return again to venice.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.503
Unless his abode be lingered
here by some accident, wherein

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:21.408
none can be so determinate
as the removing of cassio.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:24.615
How do you mean, removing him?

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.580
Why, by making him uncapable
of othello's place.

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.616
Knocking him out his brains.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:36.325
And that you would have
me to do?

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:52.443
I will be near to second your attempt,
and he shall fall between us.

01:10:57.386 --> 01:11:00.253
I have no great devotion
to the deed.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:01.514
It makes us, or it mars us.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.018
Think on that.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.138
Lago.

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.119
Lago.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.545
Hark! Who is it that knocks?

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.681
It is the wind.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.699
I called my love false love.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.694
But what said he then?

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.477
O, these men, these men

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.743
dost thou in conscience think,
tell me emilia, that there be

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.690
women do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.987
There be some such,
no question.

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:53.126
Wouldst thou do such a deed
for all the world?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.623
Why, would not you?

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:55.886
No, by this heavenly light!

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.989
Nor i neither by this
heavenly light.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.997
I might do it as well as
in the dark.

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.930
Wouldst thou do such a deed
for all the world?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.275
The world's a huge place.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.743
It is a great price for a small vice.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.705
In troth, i think thou
wouldst not.

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.770
In troth, i think i should.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.842
Marry, i would not do such a
thing for a joint-ring, nor for

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.748
measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps,

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:22.323
nor any petty exhibition, but
for all the whole world?

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.449
I do not think there is
any such woman.

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:29.561
Yes, a dozen, but i do think
it is their husbands' faults

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:30.858
if wives do fall.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.862
Say that they slack their duties
and pour our treasures into

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.732
foreign laps, or else break out
in peevish jealousies, throwing

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:40.864
restraint upon us,
or say they strike us.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:45.473
We have galls, and though
we have some grace.

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.138
Yet have we some revenge.

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:50.608
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.708
They see, and smell.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:55.353
And have their palates both for
sweet and sour, as husbands have.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.251
What is it that they do when
they change us for others?

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.051
Is it sport? I think it is.

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.393
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.496
Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:09.927
And have we not affections?
Desires for sport? And frailty?

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.800
As men have?

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:15.434
Then let them use us well,
else let them know, the ills

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.738
we do, their ills instructs us so.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.914
Good night. Good night.

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:19.672
It is the cause, it is the cause,
my soul.

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:24.108
Let me not name it for you,
you chaste stars.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:31.316
It is the cause. Yet i'll not
shed her blood.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:37.155
Nor scar that whiter skin of
hers than snow, and smooth

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:39.726
as monumental alabaster.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:46.490
Yet she must die, else she'll
betray more men.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:51.461
Put out the light, and then
put out the light.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.366
If i quench thee, thou flaming
minister, i can again they

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:59.766
former light restore, should
i repent me.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:05.573
But once put out thy light,
those cunning'st pattern of

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:10.844
excelling nature, i know not
where is that promethean heat

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:14.784
than can thy light relume.

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:18.217
- Othello.
- Ay, desdemona.

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.189
Will you come to bed, my lord?

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.069
Have you prayed tonight,
desdemona?

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:31.639
Ay, my lord.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.206
If you bethink yourself of any
crime unreconciled as yet to

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.970
heaven and grace,
solicit for it straight.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.712
Alas, my lord, what may you
mean by that?

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:42.613
Well, do it, and be brief.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:47.219
I would not kill thy
unprepared spirit.

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:50.221
No, heaven forfend!

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.056
I would not kill thy soul.

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:55.826
Talk you of killing?

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.758
Ay, i do.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:00.961
Then heaven have mercy on me.

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:03.671
Amen, with all my heart.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:08.968
If you say so, i hope
you will not kill me.

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:14.745
Peace! And be still.

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:20.046
I will so, and yet i fear you.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:23.750
Why i should fear i know not,
since guiltiness i know not.

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:26.050
But yet i feel i fear.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.930
That handkerchief!

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:33.658
That handkerchief which i so
loved and gave thee,

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.569
thou gave it to cassio.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.529
No, by my life and soul!

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.365
Send for the man and ask him.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.472
Sweet soul, take heed.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.301
Take heed of perjury,
thou art on thy deathbed.

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.241
- Lord have mercy on me.
- I say amen.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.511
And have your mercy too.
I never loved cassion in my life.

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.208
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then,

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.215
i never gave it to him.

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.582
Send for him, let him
confess the truth.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:55.757
He hath confessed.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:56.449
What, my lord?

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.991
That he hath used thee.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:03.521
How? Unlawfully?

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.332
Ay.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.200
He will not say so.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.495
No, his mouth is stopped.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.033
Honest lago hath taken
order for it.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:15.965
What, is he dead?

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:19.347
Had all his hairs been lives,
my great revenge had

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.812
stomach for them all.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:24.047
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou
for him to my face?

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:26.277
O, banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:27.749
Down, strumpet!

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:30.015
Kill me tomorrow, let me
live tonight!

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:37.388
It is too late.

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.517
Now how dost thou look now?

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:10.787
Cold, cold, my girl,
even like thy chastity!

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:14.124
O cursed, cursed slave!

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.827
Whip me, ye devils, from the
possession of this heavenly sight!

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.504
Blow me about in winds!

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:20.502
Roast me in sulphur!

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:25.135
Wash me in steep-down gulfs
of liquid fire!

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:33.979
O desdemon! Dead desdemon!
Dead, o! O!

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:36.117
My lord! My lord!

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.385
What, ho, my lord! My lord!

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.925
I do beseech you that
i may speak with you, my lord.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.265
What, ho, my lord!

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:47.894
I had forgot thee.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:50.697
O my good lord, yonder...,
alas, what cry is that?

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.064
Yonder's murders done.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:56.207
It is the very error of the moon.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.312
She comes more nearer earth
than she was wont

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.278
and that makes men mad.

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:08.115
Alas! That was my lady's voice.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:12.960
O! Sweet desdemona!
Who hath done this deed?

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.862
Nobody, i myself.

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.932
Commend me to my kind lord.

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.019
You heard her say herself.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.423
It was not i.

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.830
She said so. I must needs
report the truth.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.300
She's like a liar gone
to burning hell!

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.299
It was i that killed her.

01:22:57.772 --> 01:23:00.741
She turned to folly, and
she was a whore!

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:01.601
Liar!

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.040
Cassio did top her.

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.438
Ask thy husband else!

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.843
That she was false to wedlock?

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.038
Ay, with cassio.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:11.651
Had she been true, if heaven
would make me such another

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:16.450
world of one entire and perfect
chrysolite,

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:19.726
i'd not have sold her for it.

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.987
My husband say she was false?

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.755
Ay, it was he that told me
on her first.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:27.025
An honest man he is, and hates
the slime that sticks

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.462
on filthy deeds.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:31.232
She was too fond of her
most filthy bargain.

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:31.930
Peace.

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:33.904
- Do thy worst.
- Peace.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.969
This deed of thine is no more
worthy heaven than

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.201
thou wast worthy her.

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.539
Peace, you were best.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:43.174
O gull! O dolt! As ignorant
as dirt!

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.809
I'll make thee known though
i lost twenty lives.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:48.748
Help! Help, ho, help!

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.992
Murder! Help, ho!

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.523
Disprove this villain, if thou
be'st a man.

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:55.152
He says thou told'st him that
his wife was false.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.557
I know thou didst not.

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.763
Speak, for my heart is full.

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.992
I told him what i thought, and
told no more than what he

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.567
found himself was apt and true.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.102
But did you ever tell him
she was false?

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:05.664
I did.

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:11.968
You told a lie, upon my
soul, a lie! A wicked lie!

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.910
Did you say with cassio?

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:15.639
With cassio, mistress.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.774
Go to, charm your tongue.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.079
I will not charm my tongue.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.811
I am bound to speak.

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.983
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.384
Heaven forfend!

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:29.328
Nay, stare not, masters.

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:32.330
It is true indeed.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.536
Villainy, villainy, villainy!

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.137
I think upon it, i think i smell it.

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:43.276
O villainy! I thought so then.

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:48.075
I'll kill myself for grief.

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:49.439
What, are you mad?

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:50.641
Good gentlemen!

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:51.951
I'll charge you get your home.

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:54.314
Let me have leave to speak.

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:59.718
It is proper i obey him,
but not now.

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:05.992
Perchance, lago, i will
never go home.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.397
Nay, lay thee down and roar,
for thou hast killed the sweetest

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.470
innocent that ever
did lift up eye.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.732
O, she was foul!

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.470
Lago knows that she with
cassio hath the act of shame

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.211
a thousand times committed.

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:18.710
O heaven!

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:21.839
Cassio confessed it, and she
did gratify his amorous works

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.550
with that handkerchief!

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.577
Handkerchief!

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:27.287
- 'Twill out, 'twill out!
- Hold your peace.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.322
I peace? No! I will speak as
liberal as the north!

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.356
Be wise.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:37.096
Heaven! A man, devil did
them all, all, all!

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.358
I shame against me,
yet i'll speak.

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.829
Oh, thou dull moor, that
handkerchief thou speaks of

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:47.270
i found by fortune, and did
give my husband

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:09.955
she was chaste, she loved thee.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:17.461
She loved thee.

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:35.718
Othello, did you and he
consent in cassio's death?

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:36.812
Ay.

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:39.223
Dear general, i never gave
you cause.

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:42.553
Othello, your power and
your command is taken off,

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:45.032
and cassio rules in cyprus.

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:52.706
Be not afraid though you do
see me weaponed.

01:26:57.245 --> 01:27:00.112
Here is my journey's end.

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:05.210
Here is my butt, the very
seamark of my utmost sail.

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:15.918
Will you, i pray, demand that
demi-devil why he hath thus

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.793
ensnared my soul and body?

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.799
Demand me nothing.

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.773
What you know, you know.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:32.736
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for the thunder?

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:10.441
I pray you, when you shall
these unlucky deeds relate,

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.044
speak of me as i am.

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.927
Nothing extenuate, nor set
down aught in malice.

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:32.900
Then must you speak of one that
loved not wisely, but too well.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.779
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:49.815
perplexed in the extreme,
of one whose hand like the

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:58.293
base indian, threw a pearl
away richer than all his tribe.

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:04.496
Set you down this.

01:29:05.305 --> 01:29:11.385
