WEBVTT

00:00.391 --> 00:03.909
Look at me right?
And look at the Queen.

00:03.911 --> 00:07.211
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:07.240 --> 00:08.878
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.360
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.419 --> 00:13.737
And I know she's not a single
parent,

00:13.739 --> 00:15.337
but she might as well be. Plus,

00:15.339 --> 00:18.177
the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns.

00:18.179 --> 00:21.777
Her literally sometimes,
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.779 --> 00:24.297
Admired - and despised equally.

00:24.299 --> 00:25.657
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.417
No - for setting examples through
extremity.

00:29.419 --> 00:32.256
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:32.259 --> 00:36.259
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,
snip-snip snipping at your benefits.

00:36.539 --> 00:39.137
I mean she can't not be
looking at me and thinking -

00:39.139 --> 00:43.139
"What's your secret, Frank?"
I got shot of my kids yonks back.

00:44.219 --> 00:46.537
Whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.539 --> 00:50.539
Fine! I've had to get out of bed on
occasion to make ends meet whereas
she...

00:51.059 --> 00:54.537
she's done the whole thing from a
chair.

00:54.539 --> 00:56.257
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.259 --> 00:57.817
Oh, sure, there's perks.

00:57.819 --> 00:59.097
But, look at her lot.

00:59.099 --> 01:01.617
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.619 --> 01:08.051
Now look at my lot... we know how to
throw a proper fucking party!

01:13.939 --> 01:16.657
I had a dream last night.

01:16.659 --> 01:20.659
And in my dream I was 19 again.

01:22.179 --> 01:26.179
Could feel this broken body
working again, the energy,

01:26.692 --> 01:28.890
the spring in my step...

01:28.892 --> 01:31.650
and the people. I could see 'em, too.

01:31.652 --> 01:35.652
Oh, I've not really met
any of these folk.

01:35.852 --> 01:39.650
But young Aiden fills me
in every day on what's going on.

01:39.652 --> 01:43.652
All the comings and goings.
The screwing and the sorrow.

01:45.532 --> 01:48.650
They sort of feel
like neighbours to me now.

01:48.652 --> 01:51.570
And I was in that place, the Jockey.

01:51.572 --> 01:55.572
Could even smell the stale beer off
the woodwork, the smoke drifting in

01:56.132 --> 02:00.132
the air, no matter what those health
and safety bastards tell ya...

02:03.772 --> 02:07.410
And I was dancing with a girl.

02:07.412 --> 02:11.412
She felt as real as anything.

02:11.812 --> 02:15.812
See, you don't get older.
Not inside. Not in the head.

02:16.212 --> 02:19.170
I'm still the same guy I was at 19.

02:19.172 --> 02:22.130
But that was the worst
part of the dream...

02:22.132 --> 02:26.132
That horrific, shattering truth.

02:26.332 --> 02:30.332
You got old.

02:30.572 --> 02:32.650
And there's no going back.

02:32.652 --> 02:36.652
No fountain of youth. And I could
feel myself stirring, waking up.

02:37.452 --> 02:40.090
And I wanted to stop, to go back,

02:40.092 --> 02:43.250
to be young again,
to stay in that moment forever,

02:43.252 --> 02:47.252
I don't want to open my eyes...

02:48.412 --> 02:51.730
So I had a dream last night.

02:51.732 --> 02:55.732
And it was the last dream
I ever had.

02:57.212 --> 03:01.332
You know there's a great invention
called digital? Means you don't have
to put up with this crackly shit.

03:01.932 --> 03:05.932
It's the crackles that make it,
Aiden. Every pop, every scratch...

03:07.452 --> 03:08.930
That's history there.

03:08.932 --> 03:12.932
Stan, I hate to say it,
but I think your hearing's going.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.570
Oh, stop your yapping.

03:14.572 --> 03:18.572
Here - give me an hand finding
a horse for the weekend, at Haydock.

03:22.012 --> 03:23.410
Which one d'you fancy?

03:23.412 --> 03:27.412
It doesn't matter.
They always lose. I'm cursed.

03:29.892 --> 03:33.892
Put a tenner on it anyway.

03:40.092 --> 03:43.130
So...

03:43.132 --> 03:47.132
What else have
we got planned for today?

03:47.972 --> 03:49.370
What's she like, then?

03:49.372 --> 03:52.810
A gentlemen never discusses
a lady's particulars.

03:52.812 --> 03:54.010
So she's a dog.

03:54.012 --> 03:57.930
No, no. She's gorgeous.
She's funny, she's smart...

03:57.932 --> 04:00.290
She'd have to be to
have a chance of going out with me.

04:00.292 --> 04:02.330
- Is she real?
- You what?

04:02.332 --> 04:04.690
Well, I've just never seen you out
and about with her.

04:04.692 --> 04:07.290
Most nights you're just pissed
down the Jockey.

04:07.292 --> 04:09.330
Are you accusing me
of having a fake girlfriend?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.330
My uncle fell in love with
a sex doll.

04:11.332 --> 04:15.332
They live in caravan together now,
near Southport.

04:15.692 --> 04:19.692
Fuckin' hell, Dom, nice one.
I'd suck her shit white.

04:20.372 --> 04:21.410
What? It's a compliment.

04:21.411 --> 04:23.090
Thanks. Lovely!

04:23.092 --> 04:24.930
Dom..! Dom..!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.930
I need your help. I need you to
perform the last rites.

04:27.932 --> 04:31.610
OK - it's been a while,
but here we go. We commend to you,

04:31.612 --> 04:33.850
Oh Lord, the soul of this your
servant Aiden...

04:33.852 --> 04:35.930
No. Not for me. For the old guy.
Stanton.

04:35.932 --> 04:39.932
Serious? He's that sick?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074

04:48.612 --> 04:52.010
Jesus Christ!

04:52.012 --> 04:53.330
How long has he been like this?

04:53.332 --> 04:54.610
Five or ten minutes.

04:54.612 --> 04:58.612
All right. Billy, move the table,
come on, give me a hand. Come on,
quick, we've got to get him down.

04:59.052 --> 05:03.052
Look, you don't need to do that.

05:03.332 --> 05:04.370
Did you call an ambulance?

05:04.372 --> 05:06.610
No. I'm on it.

05:06.612 --> 05:08.250
Wait, what's the number?

05:08.252 --> 05:09.650
Nine double bloody nine!

05:09.652 --> 05:12.650
There's no point calling an
ambulance. He doesn't want it, Dom.

05:12.652 --> 05:14.530
Come on, breathe, you old bastard.

05:14.532 --> 05:17.250
Will you listen to me!
He wanted to die.

05:17.252 --> 05:21.252
He did it himself.

05:22.492 --> 05:24.330
Shit! What the bloody hell's that?

05:24.332 --> 05:27.890
I think you burst his catheter.
He took some pills.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.050
He didn't want to live like this any
more. He didn't want to be
brought back.

05:31.052 --> 05:32.050
Are you sure?

05:32.052 --> 05:33.930
Look, he said he was going to leave
a note.

05:33.932 --> 05:35.490
And that he wanted
a proper send off.

05:35.492 --> 05:39.492
He believed, y'know,
in God and all that shit.

05:45.332 --> 05:47.492
He's gone.

05:51.212 --> 05:55.212
Just give me a minute, will you?

06:13.732 --> 06:16.570
Oh... just, y'know, bins...
and recycling...

06:16.572 --> 06:18.810
Somebody's got to save the bloody
planet.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.812
It's OK. Have it.
I only chucked it because...

06:23.532 --> 06:26.730
because otherwise I would have
probably finished the bottle by
myself.

06:26.732 --> 06:30.732
Oh no, I wasn't going to drink
it... y'know... but...

06:32.012 --> 06:36.012
Waste not, want not.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.252
There's no dignity in drinking
alone, though.

06:43.892 --> 06:46.410
I think we both
passed the point of dignity

06:46.412 --> 06:49.290
when we started hanging
out by the bins.

06:49.292 --> 06:52.130
But I like your style.
I've got another one at home.

06:52.132 --> 06:56.132
Come on, then.

07:03.572 --> 07:06.610
Did he say where he was going to
leave the note? Aiden!

07:06.612 --> 07:08.330
No. I don't think so.

07:08.332 --> 07:09.330
What did he say about it?

07:09.332 --> 07:10.970
Dunno. I weren't here
when he did it.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.972
I was in the kitchen doing
the dishes.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.130
It's going to be a problem if we
don't find this note.

07:22.132 --> 07:24.170
The police will not like that.

07:24.172 --> 07:25.410
Police got nothing to do with it.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.370
For all they know,
you killed the old fella.

07:27.372 --> 07:28.610
Why would someone think that?

07:28.612 --> 07:30.810
Just saying,
considering your background.

07:30.812 --> 07:34.610
The tag and everything. The fact
you were here when Stan shuffled
off the old mortal coil.

07:34.612 --> 07:35.890
It's not the best situation, is it?

07:35.892 --> 07:36.970
I didn't do anything.

07:36.972 --> 07:40.490
Which is why a suicide note would
really help right now.

07:40.492 --> 07:41.570
We could forge a note.

07:41.572 --> 07:45.210
No. No, we can't do that.

07:45.212 --> 07:48.250
Tell you what.
We need to call this in.

07:48.252 --> 07:52.252
Come on. Aiden's got form. Without a
note, the police are going to be
shining their light on ASBO boy.

07:52.892 --> 07:55.570
Assisted suicide, that's 14 years.

07:55.572 --> 07:58.570
Be like...2030 by the time
he gets out.

07:58.572 --> 08:01.490
That's like... the future.

08:01.492 --> 08:04.170
We'll all be living on the moon.

08:04.172 --> 08:08.010
Please, Dom.
I don't want to go to jail.

08:08.012 --> 08:12.012
Please.

08:16.852 --> 08:19.970
It's not today or tomorrow that's
scaring me, Frank.

08:19.972 --> 08:22.530
I can handle that. It's just...

08:22.532 --> 08:26.532
it's going to be years and years of
me doing this all on my own,

08:26.852 --> 08:28.410
looking after the kids...

08:28.412 --> 08:32.412
I'm putting the bins out and all
of a sudden I felt that time just...

08:33.011 --> 08:34.890
stretching out in front of me.

08:34.892 --> 08:38.892
Yeah. Look, look,
you'll be fine. Trust me.

08:38.972 --> 08:42.972
Look. I have raised, seven, eight
kids...

08:43.371 --> 08:45.850
pretty much on my own...

08:45.852 --> 08:48.770
I mean, if I can do it...

08:48.772 --> 08:51.770
You're an unlikely
source of inspiration.

08:51.772 --> 08:55.250
Yes. Yes, I am.

08:55.252 --> 08:56.890
Don't you have a job to go to?

08:56.892 --> 09:00.892
The two most glorious words in the
English language - sick leave.

09:04.732 --> 09:06.450
Mum. It's the middle of the day.

09:06.452 --> 09:10.130
You could take a pointer
from the French you know, kiddo.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.410
Despite their notable cowardice
and distinct lack of personal

09:13.412 --> 09:17.412
hygiene, they adopt a laissez faire
attitude to the good grape.

09:18.052 --> 09:22.052
I don't care, you freak.

09:23.532 --> 09:25.690
She doesn't normally shut up
that quickly.

09:25.692 --> 09:27.770
I'll have to keep
you around more often.

09:27.772 --> 09:31.052
Keep the drink flowing and you won't
be able to fucking get rid of me!

09:50.012 --> 09:51.410
I weren't here when he did it.

09:51.412 --> 09:55.412
I was in the kitchen doing
the dishes.

10:02.532 --> 10:03.890
Do you really need the sellotape?

10:03.892 --> 10:05.450
Look at the guy's hand.

10:05.452 --> 10:08.170
If I'm going to write like him,
I need to be like him.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.330
Aiden, has he got any family,
y'know, any kids?

10:10.332 --> 10:13.050
A daughter. Um. Alison.

10:13.052 --> 10:16.810
Alison, OK. Alison,
my lovely daughter, Alison.

10:16.812 --> 10:18.610
Alison, Alison... it'll come.

10:18.612 --> 10:20.130
"Yo, I decided to check out early.

10:20.132 --> 10:23.170
"Hope all is good with you,
Alison. Take care. Dad."

10:23.172 --> 10:27.172
He's not nipping off down the shops.
It's the man's last words on earth.

10:28.732 --> 10:31.370
All right, I've got it.
I've got it. "Alison.

10:31.372 --> 10:34.410
"Sitting here,
in the twilight of my years,

10:34.412 --> 10:37.810
"I've realised that the hardest
word in the world is to say goodbye.

10:37.812 --> 10:40.530
"And it breaks my heart that
I have to write it,

10:40.532 --> 10:43.690
"that I won't have the chance
to say it to you.

10:43.692 --> 10:45.410
"But know this.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.770
"I wish I could say it to your face
one more time, Gloria,

10:48.772 --> 10:50.930
"just hold you in my arms..."

10:50.932 --> 10:53.530
Alison. Her name's Alison.

10:53.532 --> 10:54.290
I know that.

10:54.292 --> 10:56.210
- You said Gloria.
- I said Alison.

10:56.212 --> 10:57.250
It's shit anyway.

10:57.252 --> 10:59.410
- You didn't give me time to finish.
- He was normal.

10:59.412 --> 11:00.810
There's nothing abnormal about this,

11:00.812 --> 11:02.730
All right, granted it might be
a bit more poetic.

11:02.732 --> 11:04.290
It's a bit fuckin' torturous.

11:04.292 --> 11:08.292
Right then how about this -
"Decided to check out.

11:08.772 --> 11:12.772
"Hope all is good with you,
Alison. Take care.

11:13.972 --> 11:15.170
"Dad." You happy now?

11:15.172 --> 11:15.970
Bingo.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.090
- So you think that'll be enough?
- Yeah.

11:18.092 --> 11:21.570
Right. You come in tomorrow.
Bright and early.

11:21.572 --> 11:25.572
And the moment you come in, you phone
999, right? You tell them you've
found him dead, he's cold.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.650
And I promise you, Aiden. Nobody's
going to be sticking shit on you.

11:29.652 --> 11:32.330
All right. I really need to go -
meeting my liaison officer.

11:32.332 --> 11:34.970
OK. Make sure nobody sees
you on the way out, yeah?

11:34.972 --> 11:38.972
Me and Billy will finish up here.

11:44.572 --> 11:48.572
Bloody hell, tell you what - must
have been really determined to die.

11:52.372 --> 11:55.530
Can barely do anything with
hands like these.

11:55.532 --> 11:59.450
Poor bastard.
Probably couldn't even wank either.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.170
Yeah. Could be worse.

12:01.172 --> 12:03.530
Yeah. Police could get all
suspicious and that.

12:03.532 --> 12:07.532
Come round, do the whole CSI thing,
fingerprints, everything.

12:07.612 --> 12:09.770
Chuck our arses in jail.

12:09.772 --> 12:13.772
I didn't mean that, but...

12:14.012 --> 12:14.970
Fuck.

12:14.972 --> 12:16.239
Fuckin' hell!

12:26.695 --> 12:28.293
Tell me you love me.

12:28.295 --> 12:31.573
I love you, Dom.

12:31.575 --> 12:33.653
Tell me you'll never leave me.

12:33.655 --> 12:37.655
I'll never leave you.

12:45.535 --> 12:49.535
You should probably answer that.

12:49.575 --> 12:53.575
OK then.

12:59.815 --> 13:03.815
Aidan, great timing. What's up?

13:05.388 --> 13:06.426
It's not funny.

13:06.428 --> 13:09.106
I'm sorry, I should have warned you.
He had a skinful,

13:09.108 --> 13:11.426
and I thought it was easier
if he just crashed out here.

13:11.428 --> 13:12.866
He lives next door.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.946
It's not like he has to
get a taxi home.

13:14.948 --> 13:18.306
He's probably traumatised after
seeing you on the lavvy.

13:18.308 --> 13:21.146
This is not a joke!

13:21.148 --> 13:23.386
Morning.

13:23.388 --> 13:25.426
That's my toothbrush!

13:25.428 --> 13:28.706
Cheers, kiddo. See you later.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.586
He's not coming round here again.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.946
Frank's OK. He's been a good mate.

13:32.948 --> 13:34.786
And think of it as a lesson.

13:34.788 --> 13:36.586
Things aren't going to be
so easy any more.

13:36.588 --> 13:40.146
You're going to need to learn to
toughen up, roll with the punches.

13:40.148 --> 13:44.148
Frank's the perfect training ground.

13:49.268 --> 13:51.066
Has, er... Aidan called?

13:51.068 --> 13:54.906
No.

13:54.908 --> 13:55.946
Dom?

13:55.948 --> 13:57.506
No.

13:57.508 --> 13:58.546
You sure?

13:58.548 --> 14:01.946
Yup.

14:01.948 --> 14:05.948
That's a bit weird.
Thought I would have had an update.

14:06.228 --> 14:10.228
Oh, er... young Aidan's found
himself in a spot of trouble.

14:10.308 --> 14:14.226
Big trouble. Serious, really.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.906
Course, I am helping him out, like.

14:17.908 --> 14:21.148
Pretty much the only thing
standing between him and jail.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.706
That poor lad.
Then he is fucked, isn't he?

14:25.708 --> 14:26.826
Do you know what?

14:26.828 --> 14:29.186
I think I deserve a little bit more
respect round here.

14:29.188 --> 14:32.026
It's just as well you're handsome,
lad,

14:32.028 --> 14:34.428
otherwise you
really would be in trouble.

14:39.788 --> 14:41.066
What's up?

14:41.068 --> 14:42.868
It's his birthday.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.367
Is that why you called me over?

14:44.369 --> 14:46.487
Aidan, if one of the neighbours
would have seen me

14:46.489 --> 14:48.087
it would have screwed everything up!

14:48.089 --> 14:51.167
No. Look at the return address.
Angela. That's his daughter's name.

14:51.169 --> 14:53.607
Not Alison. I tried to change it but
I fucked it up.

14:53.609 --> 14:54.807
I was late, I was in a rush.

14:54.809 --> 14:57.327
OK. It's no big deal.
I'll do it over again.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.567
Have to be quick,
though, right. Time's running out.

14:59.569 --> 15:02.009
Longer we leave it, more
chance of something screwing up.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.909
Dom? Aidan?

15:11.007 --> 15:12.045
Billy.

15:12.047 --> 15:16.047
Dom, are you in there?
Dom? Aidan, you in there?

15:18.407 --> 15:21.467
Get in! Get in! Quick! Quick, quick,
quick, quick.

15:21.474 --> 15:22.512
What you doing?

15:22.514 --> 15:23.712
Why weren't I invited?

15:23.714 --> 15:24.872
It's not a party, you know.

15:24.874 --> 15:27.072
We're not doing the fucking
hokey cokey in here.

15:27.074 --> 15:28.832
There's a problem with
the suicide note.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.952
Well, don't leave me on the bench!
It's not fair.

15:30.954 --> 15:32.232
I'm not useless.

15:32.234 --> 15:33.832
You know what, you're right!

15:33.834 --> 15:36.552
You know, when Aidan phoned me
this morning, my primary concern

15:36.554 --> 15:39.072
shouldn't have been the note,
dead body, the police. No!

15:39.074 --> 15:40.832
It should have been Billy Tutton.

15:40.834 --> 15:44.834
Thanks, Dom.

15:46.714 --> 15:50.714
OK. Don't do anything, don't touch
anything. In fact, don't even speak.

15:51.434 --> 15:53.032
I need to get that note
written again,

15:53.034 --> 15:57.034
and we need to get
the hell out of here.

16:02.034 --> 16:04.432
They're some nice treads, them.

16:04.434 --> 16:07.352
I fancied a pair of them myself but
Mimi's sort of cut my pocket money.

16:07.354 --> 16:10.272
Wanted these for ages, but...
you know...

16:10.274 --> 16:14.274
Yeah, man.
Live each day as if it's your last?

16:16.794 --> 16:18.312
What you doing? I was smoking that!

16:18.314 --> 16:20.272
And you know who wasn't smoking
it, don't you?

16:20.274 --> 16:21.992
Ever? The old fella.

16:21.994 --> 16:24.792
So when the ambulance men roll in
and the place stinks of fucking

16:24.794 --> 16:28.472
draw, don't you think they'll be
the tiniest bit suspicious?

16:28.474 --> 16:30.592
All right, Dom! Think you need to
calm down a bit.

16:30.594 --> 16:33.272
Oh yeah, of course. It's me
who's out of line, innit?

16:33.274 --> 16:35.752
Not Smokey fucking Joe here.

16:35.754 --> 16:39.754
Fine! Take it elsewhere. Jesus!

16:41.474 --> 16:44.272
He's round ours
practically all the time.

16:44.274 --> 16:46.072
And he slept in the bath tub?

16:46.074 --> 16:47.112
Yeah.

16:47.114 --> 16:50.232
That's not good.
Means he's already starting to nest.

16:50.234 --> 16:51.792
Nest?

16:51.794 --> 16:53.432
Burrow his way in,
deep as he can,

16:53.434 --> 16:55.232
so he's safe
and warm for the winter.

16:55.234 --> 16:56.952
And you better get used to it.

16:56.954 --> 16:57.992
Cool!

16:57.994 --> 16:59.192
No, it's not cool.

16:59.194 --> 17:01.272
< I'm up for it.
As long as Frank's around,

17:01.274 --> 17:04.112
Mum doesn't feel the need to yak
away at us about Dad.

17:04.114 --> 17:06.192
Fine. I'll deal with it.

17:06.194 --> 17:07.752
It's bad enough we have to live here,

17:07.753 --> 17:09.712
but I'm not sharing my space
with that...

17:09.714 --> 17:10.832
parasite.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.912
You'll deal with it?

17:12.914 --> 17:14.271
You're an amateur, kid.

17:14.273 --> 17:16.551
Not only are you not in the same
league as Frank,

17:16.554 --> 17:18.314
you're not even playing
the same sport.

17:21.753 --> 17:25.472
No, no, no! I'm sorry! Please,
I didn't mean to upset you!

17:25.473 --> 17:29.474
Ohhh! The fake tears gambit! Risky.
But if you pull it off...

17:30.554 --> 17:34.352
Course I'll pull it off. I'm a woman!

17:34.354 --> 17:37.634
Frank Gallagher doesn't
stand a chance.

17:39.114 --> 17:40.832
I just feel like...

17:40.834 --> 17:44.834
now's the time the family needs to
pull together, just us.

17:46.114 --> 17:50.114
So if you could give us
some space, please...

17:53.714 --> 17:56.472
Bloody hell, kid!

17:56.474 --> 17:57.832
Thank you.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.352
No, I mean, that was awful!

18:00.354 --> 18:01.752
She's rubbish!

18:01.754 --> 18:04.152
Harsh but fair.
Nobody likes a critic.

18:04.154 --> 18:08.154
Listen,
I have seen the masters of this art

18:08.474 --> 18:10.872
down the dole office.

18:10.874 --> 18:14.792
I wanted the job so bad!
I'm a failure!

18:14.794 --> 18:18.592
Dad, I let you down!

18:18.594 --> 18:21.272
I mean, you... You're all over the
place.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.712
Too much vibrato,
too many tears, too soon,

18:24.714 --> 18:28.714
no sense of building to a crescendo.

18:29.314 --> 18:33.112
I don't want you hanging
round my house, Frank. End of!

18:33.114 --> 18:36.112
Well, your mum does. End of!

18:36.114 --> 18:40.114
You do not want to go to
war with me!

18:40.754 --> 18:42.912
That's a lot better.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.192
Yeah, yeah.
I think that could be your thing.

18:45.194 --> 18:47.832
You know, cold, mechanical,
threatening.

18:47.834 --> 18:51.834
Leave the emotional stuff to
the experts.

19:04.314 --> 19:05.354
Morning.

19:06.434 --> 19:07.752
You one of the family?

19:07.754 --> 19:09.992
Come to wish the old bugger
happy birthday?

19:09.994 --> 19:13.272
No. I'm... I'm here to do the
garden.

19:13.274 --> 19:16.112
Oh, you can do mine as well.
Free of charge, of course.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.152
Yeah, OK.

19:17.154 --> 19:18.592
Right, well...

19:18.594 --> 19:20.832
I'll just pop in and give Stan this
bottle of whiskey.

19:20.834 --> 19:21.872
It's got his name on it.

19:21.874 --> 19:24.032
No, you can't!

19:24.034 --> 19:25.472
He's... He's gone out...

19:25.474 --> 19:28.432
for cake
and ice cream, for his birthday.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.672
I don't know when he'll be back.

19:30.674 --> 19:32.832
Your eyes are a little bloodshot,
son.

19:32.834 --> 19:36.272
Yeah. I'm allergic...

19:36.274 --> 19:37.832
to grass.

19:37.834 --> 19:41.834
Right.

19:46.554 --> 19:47.912
What were you thinking?

19:47.914 --> 19:49.512
You told me not to smoke inside.

19:49.514 --> 19:51.232
Yeah, but the neighbours
have seen you,

19:51.234 --> 19:52.952
so we can't go through with
the plan now.

19:52.954 --> 19:54.112
You said Stan wasn't here!

19:54.114 --> 19:55.592
You're being a bit aggressive.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.072
And you're fucking useless!

19:57.074 --> 19:59.112
Don't... Don't say that again!

19:59.114 --> 20:03.114
OK.

20:03.674 --> 20:06.752
OK. This is what we do.

20:06.754 --> 20:08.392
We re-write the suicide note.

20:08.394 --> 20:10.952
We make up some shit about how
he wanted to die somewhere nice

20:10.954 --> 20:13.032
and peaceful, nature around him.

20:13.034 --> 20:14.512
Yeah, that's nice.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.592
'We take Stanton out to his car,

20:17.594 --> 20:20.152
'we stick him in the driver's seat,
pills next to him.

20:20.154 --> 20:22.192
'Meanwhile, Aidan's showed
up for work.'

20:22.194 --> 20:26.194
I think he just wanted to
end it all.

20:26.554 --> 20:28.152
'Police go out there, find him

20:28.154 --> 20:32.154
'in the car, dead, probably been
there all night. Whatever.'

20:32.754 --> 20:35.072
End of story.

20:35.074 --> 20:37.632
Right, Aidan. Go outside, make sure
the coast is clear.

20:37.634 --> 20:41.634
Nobody, nobody, can see us.

21:00.874 --> 21:01.912
Got it?

21:01.914 --> 21:02.992
Yeah.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.232
Keys?

21:04.234 --> 21:05.272
Shit!

21:05.274 --> 21:09.274
I've got them.

21:12.114 --> 21:13.392
This is from this morning.

21:13.394 --> 21:15.392
Yeah. Some dickhead traffic
warden nabbed me.

21:15.394 --> 21:16.872
You took the car out for a drive?

21:16.874 --> 21:19.672
Well, I had to go town,
get these trainers.

21:19.674 --> 21:20.712
That wasn't the plan!

21:20.714 --> 21:23.152
It's OK! He said that I could
use his car whenever I wanted.

21:23.154 --> 21:24.552
They are nice trainers, though.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.552
I might ask Mimi to get me
a pair for my birthday.

21:26.554 --> 21:28.352
Are you both fucking insane?

21:28.354 --> 21:30.312
This means we can't take
Stanton out in the car

21:30.314 --> 21:32.952
because it's been ticketed,
logged, as being somewhere else!

21:32.954 --> 21:35.472
Maybe he stopped off in town
on his way to commit suicide.

21:35.474 --> 21:38.152
He died yesterday, not today!
That's the whole point!

21:38.154 --> 21:41.472
We had to make it look as if the car
had been there overnight.

21:41.474 --> 21:42.512
Maybe...

21:42.514 --> 21:46.312
Maybe the corpse had just got up,
started the car, drove into town?

21:46.314 --> 21:48.632
Shopping trip of the living
fucking dead?

21:48.634 --> 21:52.352
Shit! Yeah, I see your point.
Tricky situation, innit?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.352
Christ, right! Get him back inside.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.392
Right, well, what we going to do
now?

21:55.394 --> 21:56.432
I don't know.

21:56.434 --> 21:58.752
All I do know is we're
standing in a fucking garage with

21:58.754 --> 22:00.952
a fucking dead body
and we're all in the fucking shit

22:00.954 --> 22:04.954
unless we find a way out of this!
So come on!

22:07.714 --> 22:10.432
I think you need to come up with a
better plan, Dom. I mean...

22:10.434 --> 22:14.192
to be fair, you've pretty much
screwed things up so far.

22:14.194 --> 22:17.192
Eh! It would have been fine if your
useless fucking arse

22:17.194 --> 22:19.152
hadn't have
come over and ruined everything.

22:19.154 --> 22:20.752
Don't call me useless! Fair warning.

22:20.754 --> 22:21.912
Well, what you going to do?

22:21.914 --> 22:24.072
Get your fucking wife to
fight your battles for you

22:24.074 --> 22:25.392
like the useless twat you are?

22:25.394 --> 22:26.432
Told you to shut it!

22:26.434 --> 22:28.272
Stop it! Stop it!

22:28.274 --> 22:29.752
This isn't what I asked for!

22:29.754 --> 22:32.352
He was a nice guy and you're not
treating him with any respect.

22:32.354 --> 22:33.872
I'm not? It's Dom!

22:33.874 --> 22:35.192
He keeps going on at me!

22:35.194 --> 22:37.272
No, I think the boy's right.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.766
You're treating my father with
a lot of disrespect.

22:43.493 --> 22:47.171
I know it looks bad.

22:47.173 --> 22:51.173
You're Aiden, aren't you?
I recognise you.

22:52.813 --> 22:56.813
Dad sent me a photo.

23:00.493 --> 23:03.331
You did it, didn't you?

23:03.333 --> 23:04.531
Yes.

23:04.533 --> 23:07.211
Aiden. You don't have say
anything right now.

23:07.213 --> 23:08.253
Who are you?

23:08.350 --> 23:12.150
A friend of Aiden's. I'm a priest.
On gardening leave.

23:12.159 --> 23:13.357
We're the clean-up guys.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.399
- We're not.
- If people have a problem, they call us.

23:15.457 --> 23:16.455
We're not professionals.

23:16.457 --> 23:19.255
Yeah. I gathered that.

23:19.257 --> 23:23.257
I know he wanted to end things.
He talked about it and...

23:23.617 --> 23:26.415
I said to him,
"Don't drag anyone else into this."

23:26.417 --> 23:28.015
It's all right.

23:28.017 --> 23:31.735
No, it's not.

23:31.737 --> 23:34.695
He used to say
he just wanted to sleep.

23:34.697 --> 23:37.535
He said he was sick of waking up.

23:37.537 --> 23:40.455
He had no right to ask you.

23:40.457 --> 23:44.457
I'm sorry about all of this
but I was scared.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.935
I didn't want to get in trouble.

23:46.937 --> 23:48.415
You're not in trouble.

23:48.417 --> 23:52.417
My dad was lucky to know
somebody like you.

23:58.217 --> 23:59.695
What was all that about, eh?

23:59.697 --> 24:02.255
Aiden swore he didn't do
it and he goes all doey-eyed and...

24:02.257 --> 24:03.895
Billy.
We need to talk about this.

24:03.897 --> 24:05.135
You said I was useless.

24:05.137 --> 24:06.495
Yeah?

24:06.497 --> 24:08.575
What kind of a mate are you, anyway?

24:08.577 --> 24:09.975
Well, we're not really mates, are we?

24:09.977 --> 24:12.655
Yeah. Exactly. So I don't need to
listen to you.

24:12.657 --> 24:14.735
Try and wrestle your fucking
head around this.

24:14.737 --> 24:16.815
Aiden's fine.
Stan's daughter's cool.

24:16.817 --> 24:18.295
You're still a twat.

24:18.297 --> 24:22.297
Billy. Billy!

24:25.817 --> 24:26.855
All right?

24:26.857 --> 24:29.135
I'm going to go stay with
Gran for a bit.

24:29.137 --> 24:30.215
What brought this on?

24:30.217 --> 24:33.535
I realised that every time
you look at me... Saul... Tam...

24:33.537 --> 24:37.537
You see him. You see Dad.
And you resent us for...

24:37.697 --> 24:38.855
for being here.

24:38.857 --> 24:42.135
No. Don't say that.

24:42.137 --> 24:44.935
It's OK.
I think it's good that Frank's here.

24:44.937 --> 24:48.455
You've got a mate.
It's what you need. I just feel...

24:48.457 --> 24:50.495
I'm in the way.

24:50.497 --> 24:54.415
You are never,
ever in the way, all right?

24:54.417 --> 24:58.175
I'm sorry if I made you
feel like that. From now on...

24:58.177 --> 25:00.455
just the four of us.

25:00.457 --> 25:04.457
Don't cry. You'll start me off.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.575
I hear you've been buzzing
round Esther's.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.815
Everybody needs good neighbours.

25:14.817 --> 25:18.375
Friendly warning. That's my
brother's missus. You don't want the
unfriendly one.

25:18.377 --> 25:22.377
It's not like that, y'know,
she's a mate. It's not sexual.

25:22.857 --> 25:24.015
Well, not on my part.

25:24.017 --> 25:28.017
The unfriendly warning involves
you picking your teeth off the bar,
Frank.

25:29.777 --> 25:32.295
Service with a bloody smile, eh?

25:32.297 --> 25:34.575
If you're wanting to
apologise for hitting me...

25:34.577 --> 25:38.577
No. You deserved it.
You've got a really punchable face.

25:40.297 --> 25:43.015
Just felt sorry for you sitting here
alone. Where's your bird?

25:43.017 --> 25:44.175
Working.

25:44.177 --> 25:45.935
"Fuck off, Billy. Leave me alone."

25:45.937 --> 25:48.495
Billy, no... it's just this whole
Aiden thing, yeah?

25:48.497 --> 25:52.497
I'm sorry. Sit down.

25:54.377 --> 25:57.135
What are you so worried about?
Aiden did a good job.

25:57.137 --> 25:58.375
We're all in the clear.

25:58.377 --> 25:59.495
Because he lied to us.

25:59.497 --> 26:02.335
He told Stanton's daughter
he helped him to die.

26:02.337 --> 26:03.855
Maybe he lied to her.

26:03.857 --> 26:06.295
And the flash trainers?
And driving around in Stan's car.

26:06.297 --> 26:08.335
- You think he killed him?
- No, but...

26:08.337 --> 26:11.175
Maybe he did. Fits the profile.
Serial killer.

26:11.177 --> 26:13.335
Mimi's got loads of them
true crime books at home.

26:13.337 --> 26:14.775
She's probably in some of them, too.

26:14.777 --> 26:17.095
90% of serial killers are male,

26:17.097 --> 26:20.535
abandoned by their families,
unstable families with alcohol or
drug addiction.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.535
C'mon, his mum was a prossie and a
junkie, so that ticks that box.

26:23.537 --> 26:25.375
For fuck's sake. He's not a serial
killer.

26:25.377 --> 26:27.455
Interested in voyeurism
and pornography.

26:27.457 --> 26:28.855
That's everyone round here.

26:28.857 --> 26:30.175
Wets their beds until they were 12.

26:30.177 --> 26:32.055
Look. Aiden's got no-one else to
rely on.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.775
We can't start thinking
shit about him.

26:33.777 --> 26:37.777
He's just a nice normal lad.

26:38.017 --> 26:42.017
That's it.

26:45.417 --> 26:48.535
I can't, not this afternoon.
Family problems.

26:48.537 --> 26:50.375
I really need to focus on my kids.

26:50.377 --> 26:52.575
Yeah, but I won't make much noise.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.295
You'll hardly even know I'm there.

26:54.297 --> 26:58.297
Sorry, Frank.

27:04.097 --> 27:05.655
Aw, she'll come round.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.255
She won't.

27:08.257 --> 27:12.257
It's the bloody kids,
y'know? They can't see it.

27:13.337 --> 27:16.615
She needs me. She's got no-one else.

27:16.617 --> 27:19.495
Just get her drunk and shag her.

27:19.497 --> 27:23.497
No. It's not like that.
I like her. She's a friend.

27:24.137 --> 27:28.137
You know, fucking... mate.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.575
So. Blow job?

27:33.577 --> 27:35.295
Gimme a second.

27:35.297 --> 27:36.855
Whoa.

27:36.857 --> 27:38.575
Walked into a door.

27:38.577 --> 27:39.975
Yeah, well...

27:39.977 --> 27:43.977
It's nothing. Just my old man...
Biddy. Sometimes...

27:45.657 --> 27:49.015
Sometimes he struggles to
get his point across.

27:49.017 --> 27:53.017
Hang on,
I've got some TCP here somewhere.

27:53.817 --> 27:57.817
I've told him I don't like it.
The shouting's bad enough but...

27:57.977 --> 27:59.815
No, no. You can't just tell him.

27:59.817 --> 28:02.295
In one ear, out the other.
Write it down.

28:02.297 --> 28:06.255
Make him read it. Come here.

28:06.257 --> 28:08.615
Right, hold still a bit.
This may sting.

28:08.617 --> 28:10.695
Ahhhh! The fuck...!

28:10.697 --> 28:13.095
I said it might sting.

28:13.097 --> 28:17.097
Fucking turps, Frank. If you're
trying to make me feel better,
it's not helping.

28:17.257 --> 28:21.257
Would a couple of pints
and a party make you feel better?

28:23.537 --> 28:25.495
Stan enjoyed a party.

28:25.497 --> 28:29.497
He would have been really made up to
see everyone having a great
time... just living life.

28:29.977 --> 28:32.655
I guess all that's left to say is...
to Stan.

28:32.657 --> 28:34.455
To Stan!

28:34.457 --> 28:35.855
Who's Stan?

28:35.857 --> 28:36.855
No idea.

28:36.857 --> 28:40.857
Let's party!

28:43.937 --> 28:46.295
I'm just glad
I could get Aiden off the hook.

28:46.297 --> 28:48.935
I thought you said
he asked Dom to help.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.335
Well, yeah... me and Dom.

28:50.337 --> 28:54.337
Or more likely just Dom and you were
hanging around like a spare twat.

28:55.617 --> 28:57.935
She's always trying to make
out like I'm useless.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.695
Hey, you're not useless.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.697
Come on, quick as you can.

29:19.977 --> 29:22.815
You're being a right dick.
Mum's miserable.

29:22.817 --> 29:24.295
And you're making it worse.

29:24.297 --> 29:26.095
Just because the medicine
tastes bad,

29:26.097 --> 29:27.775
doesn't mean it's not necessary.

29:27.777 --> 29:29.695
Don't know what
I was worried about, anyway.

29:29.697 --> 29:32.415
Frank Gallagher was a total
pushover.

29:32.417 --> 29:36.417
You sure about that?

29:43.537 --> 29:45.815
You made it. Let me get that.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.175
No, you're all right.

29:47.177 --> 29:49.535
C'mon, Dom. I'm buying
a round for the whole bar anyway.

29:49.537 --> 29:53.175
Y'know these don't care about
Stanton. They're all leeches,
hangers on.

29:53.177 --> 29:56.175
Hey. Don't be arguing
with my favourite customer.

29:56.177 --> 29:58.695
Come on, Jamie. He's a kid -
he can't afford it anyway.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.655
So you don't want me
to pay for your drink?

30:00.657 --> 30:04.657
All right, fine.
Make it a double yeah?

30:10.577 --> 30:14.415
What the fuck's that?
This is Stanton's cash card.

30:14.417 --> 30:15.495
What are you doing with that?

30:15.497 --> 30:16.415
It's OK.

30:16.417 --> 30:17.775
No, it's not OK.

30:17.777 --> 30:20.215
Drinks for everyone!

30:20.217 --> 30:24.217
Outside. Now.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.615
Why have you got his cash card?

30:26.617 --> 30:28.055
- He gave it to me.
- Bullshit!

30:28.057 --> 30:29.135
He did.

30:29.137 --> 30:33.137
You've never had much luck, have you,
Aiden? Your dad buggering off, your
mam a junkie, on the game,

30:33.497 --> 30:35.855
turning her back on you.
But look at you now, eh?

30:35.857 --> 30:39.857
With your flash new trainers, a car,
money, centre of fucking attention.

30:40.017 --> 30:44.017
Fucking hell!

30:44.417 --> 30:47.775
Sorry.

30:47.777 --> 30:49.615
I thought you were just a poor kid.

30:49.617 --> 30:52.215
Scared. Out of his depth.

30:52.217 --> 30:55.495
But I see you for what you
really are, Aiden.

30:55.497 --> 30:58.575
You killed him, didn't you little
bastard? Yes, you fucking did.

30:58.577 --> 30:59.935
You did it.

30:59.937 --> 31:03.097
Dom!

32:06.162 --> 32:08.720
Is this how you think it went down?

32:08.722 --> 32:12.722
Aidan!

32:13.842 --> 32:16.000
Probably enjoyed it, didn't I?

32:16.002 --> 32:17.602
Got a kick out of it.

32:17.653 --> 32:18.971
You don't need to do this.

32:18.973 --> 32:21.811
Do it? It's already done.

32:21.813 --> 32:24.291
Make you feel better, judging me,

32:24.293 --> 32:26.811
throwing me to the wolves? Nah.
It didn't, did it?

32:26.813 --> 32:28.331
Poor old Dom, eh?

32:28.333 --> 32:32.333
He ain't happy till everyone's
fucked up as him.

32:34.613 --> 32:38.613
We can make that happen.

32:38.733 --> 32:42.733
This is the part where you wake up,
gasping for breath.

32:45.053 --> 32:49.053
Ohh!

32:57.133 --> 32:58.291
How did it go, then?

32:58.293 --> 32:59.691
Aidan got arrested.

32:59.693 --> 33:03.693
Yeah, I heard. Ah! So Frank came
round, all droopy-eyed.

33:03.813 --> 33:05.971
"Me kid! Me fuckin' kid!"

33:05.973 --> 33:07.171
Yup.

33:07.173 --> 33:08.731
He doesn't miss a trick.

33:08.733 --> 33:11.731
Me neither. Bottle of whisky,
please.

33:11.733 --> 33:15.733
Drink's not always the answer.

33:24.533 --> 33:25.811
Do you have to go now?

33:25.813 --> 33:26.851
You know I do.

33:26.853 --> 33:29.051
Can't you just stay a little bit
longer?

33:29.053 --> 33:30.531
Hanging on by a thread here.

33:30.533 --> 33:32.491
If you want me
to stay for till this afternoon,

33:32.493 --> 33:34.531
you'll have to pay me again.

33:34.533 --> 33:35.851
Just need a mate.

33:35.853 --> 33:38.171
Then call a mate.

33:38.173 --> 33:42.171
I don't have any mates.
Don't have anyone.

33:42.173 --> 33:45.251
I don't have any more
money. I've got nothing.

33:45.253 --> 33:48.251
Then call me
when you do. Take care, Dom.

33:48.253 --> 33:51.931
Nadine, come on! Wait.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.811
Please.

33:53.813 --> 33:57.813
My name's not really Nadine.
You do realise that, right?

34:20.973 --> 34:24.130
Just wanted to
apologise for last night.

34:24.132 --> 34:27.571
You heard about Aidan, then?

34:27.572 --> 34:28.610
Yeah.

34:28.612 --> 34:30.411
I know he didn't kill my father.

34:30.413 --> 34:32.610
You seem pretty certain about that.
I mean,

34:32.612 --> 34:36.612
these things do happen,
especially where Aidan comes from.

34:36.893 --> 34:40.331
Dad asked me, many times.

34:40.333 --> 34:44.333
He asked me to help him die
and I wouldn't.

34:44.453 --> 34:47.170
I couldn't.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.371
And he told me...

34:48.373 --> 34:51.971
he told me he didn't want to see
another birthday pass.

34:51.973 --> 34:54.491
I knew he wouldn't be with us
any more.

34:54.493 --> 34:58.493
Just... be there for Aidan, eh?
He did a brave thing.

35:00.613 --> 35:04.613
There aren't many brave men
left in the world.

35:20.813 --> 35:24.813
Sorry about Aidan.

35:31.493 --> 35:34.091
Mum said you were sick,
care of you and..

35:34.093 --> 35:37.851
Considering what's been going on.

35:37.853 --> 35:41.853
Thanks.

36:29.893 --> 36:33.171
Bloody hell, mate!
You going to a fancy dress party?

36:33.173 --> 36:36.011
For with the judgment you pronounce,
you will be judged,

36:36.013 --> 36:40.013
and with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

36:41.013 --> 36:44.211
Why do you see the speck that is
in your brother's eye

36:44.213 --> 36:47.251
but you do not notice the log that
is in your own?

36:47.253 --> 36:50.611
Matthew 7, verses 1-5.

36:50.613 --> 36:54.613
So, what...
you've got something in your eye?

37:22.253 --> 37:25.691
Any chance of a cup of tea?

37:25.693 --> 37:28.891
You said you had information
pertaining to Aidan Croker?

37:28.893 --> 37:31.491
Yeah.

37:31.493 --> 37:33.611
He didn't kill the old fella,

37:33.613 --> 37:35.531
Stanton.

37:35.533 --> 37:39.533
He didn't even help Stanton
do himself in. He's innocent.

37:40.813 --> 37:42.171
How do you know this?

37:42.173 --> 37:46.173
Because... it was me.

37:46.413 --> 37:50.413
I helped Stanton. I helped him die.

37:53.493 --> 37:57.493
It was me.

37:58.133 --> 38:00.651
Frank?

38:00.653 --> 38:03.091
Frank, what the
hell are you doing?

38:03.093 --> 38:04.371
Frank!

38:04.373 --> 38:05.691
What? What, what, what?

38:05.693 --> 38:07.531
You're in my bed, naked!

38:07.533 --> 38:11.173
It's not... it's not what it looks
like! It's not... it's not sexual.

38:12.213 --> 38:13.451
It's... come on, it's...

38:13.453 --> 38:16.411
Look, it's flaccid, it's flaccid!
It's like a baby's!

38:16.413 --> 38:17.971
I know, Frank. I'm not stupid!

38:17.973 --> 38:19.731
I know you didn't mean
anything by it.

38:19.733 --> 38:21.211
Thank you.

38:21.213 --> 38:25.213
But you have to go, anyway.

38:25.733 --> 38:29.733
I didn't want to get drunk.
They forced me.

38:31.693 --> 38:34.891
My life's been turned upside down
and back to front.

38:34.893 --> 38:38.051
I don't want to live in a war zone,
fighting with my kids,

38:38.053 --> 38:40.811
with her, every day.

38:40.813 --> 38:44.813
I don't have the energy.

38:46.373 --> 38:50.373
Fine.

38:50.973 --> 38:54.973
I'll just see myself out.

39:03.373 --> 39:07.211
You've made bail. Friend of yours
has posted it for you.

39:07.213 --> 39:11.213
Love, I don't have any friends.

39:11.253 --> 39:15.253
I wonder why! Shift it!

39:38.773 --> 39:40.771
Why didn't you tell me you helped
Stanton die

39:40.773 --> 39:42.491
back in the house that
first morning?

39:42.493 --> 39:44.211
Cos you're a priest.

39:44.213 --> 39:46.451
Come on! Not really.

39:46.453 --> 39:49.891
Yeah, but you believe in that stuff,
sin, the soul.

39:49.893 --> 39:53.891
Didn't want you
looking down on me. I like you, Dom.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.211
You know, I don't know whether

39:55.213 --> 39:56.931
you're bullshitting me or not
any more.

39:56.933 --> 39:58.851
You probably should have thought
about that

39:58.853 --> 40:00.771
before you turned
yourself into the police.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.691
You're screwed now. Why d'you do it?

40:02.693 --> 40:06.693
You wouldn't understand.

40:07.933 --> 40:10.331
That's all that's left of his money.
It's OK.

40:10.333 --> 40:14.333
It's a couple of grand.
It'll get you started elsewhere.

40:14.733 --> 40:18.733
Brought your stuff.

40:19.773 --> 40:21.851
You sending me into exile, Aidan?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.051
This place is killing you.

40:23.053 --> 40:25.051
And now you're going to end
up in jail. For what?

40:25.053 --> 40:26.891
I know you don't think that I'm
smart,

40:26.893 --> 40:30.131
but you're just like my mum,
fucking things up on purpose,

40:30.133 --> 40:34.133
punishing yourself. See, Stanton...
he didn't have a choice.

40:34.213 --> 40:38.213
Parkinson's. He couldn't
escape from that. But you can.

40:38.413 --> 40:41.411
Take you anywhere you like.

40:41.413 --> 40:45.413
You're ridiculous, you know that?

41:15.493 --> 41:16.851
You can stop right here.

41:16.853 --> 41:17.891
Here?

41:17.893 --> 41:18.931
Yeah, here.

41:18.933 --> 41:20.091
But there's nothing here.

41:20.093 --> 41:24.093
Yeah, quite like that.

41:41.213 --> 41:42.971
For my own peace of mind, Aidan,

41:42.973 --> 41:45.811
what happened with the old fella?
What really happened?

41:45.813 --> 41:48.811
Bye, Dom.

41:48.813 --> 41:51.331
Thanks...

41:51.333 --> 41:55.333
for everything.

43:06.813 --> 43:10.813
'There was a lot of things
I meant to tell young Aidan...

43:11.813 --> 43:15.451
'..how weird it was to think of it
all going on without me,

43:15.453 --> 43:17.491
'once I'm gone.

43:17.493 --> 43:21.493
'Life, people sleepwalking through
it, racing through it, stumbling...

43:24.053 --> 43:27.171
'forgetting to stop and enjoy it.'

43:27.173 --> 43:29.571
Think you're right.

43:29.573 --> 43:33.573
Think I am useless.

43:33.773 --> 43:35.571
Who feeds Cilla every day?

43:35.573 --> 43:39.573
Who looks after her, bathes her,
plays with her, puts her to bed?

43:40.853 --> 43:44.853
You're not useless, Billy. You're
a housewife. And a damn good one.

43:45.773 --> 43:49.773
Let's face it.
I need you more than you need me.

43:50.293 --> 43:54.293
'I meant to tell him that it
doesn't matter...'

43:54.573 --> 43:58.573
We're having casserole for dinner.
And, you know, Mum makes too much.

43:59.293 --> 44:03.293
So, you know, if you wanted to...

44:04.013 --> 44:08.013
Touch my fucking toothbrush again
and I'll fucking kill ya.

44:08.573 --> 44:12.573
'..All the small problems, the
slights, the bumps in the road.'

44:14.333 --> 44:18.333
That's mine!

44:22.453 --> 44:26.453
'One day, we'll all be dust
and this will be nothing.

44:29.653 --> 44:33.171
'I meant to tell him the other thing
about what I said,

44:33.173 --> 44:37.173
'about waiting for the right
horse to come in.

44:39.413 --> 44:41.931
'Yeah, it's a pain in the arse
when you lose,

44:41.933 --> 44:44.531
'but at least you had
the thrill of the race,

44:44.533 --> 44:47.451
'the beauty of uncertainty.

44:47.453 --> 44:50.371
'At least you were
living in that moment.

44:50.373 --> 44:53.931
'That's what it was all about.

44:53.933 --> 44:56.131
'Ahh! He's a smart kid.

44:56.133 --> 45:00.133
'He'll work it out.'

45:01.813 --> 45:04.691
Promote it and they will come.

45:04.693 --> 45:06.211
Are you going to Shane's festival?

45:06.213 --> 45:09.731
When a man is scared, testosterone
and adrenaline increase.

45:09.733 --> 45:10.811
Just scare him, right?

45:10.813 --> 45:11.851
Fucking move!

45:11.853 --> 45:13.011
What's she going on about?

45:13.013 --> 45:14.051
He shags his copper.

45:14.053 --> 45:16.051
Jack The Ripper can beast my
ringpiece today.

45:16.053 --> 45:18.171
Six years with a psycho brass.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.211
Now another mad bitch.

45:19.213 --> 45:21.531
Maguire, crime family. Get rid.

45:21.533 --> 45:22.571
Right now!

45:22.573 --> 45:24.611
You don't get to tell me
what to do any more.

45:24.613 --> 45:26.091
We've got a fed, three o'clock.

45:26.093 --> 45:30.093
At the hands of me own son!

45:30.118 --> 46:07.709

46:10.133 --> 46:12.651
So since I was running
about like a twat, and you've been

46:12.653 --> 46:14.291
round at Esther's the whole time,

46:14.293 --> 46:18.293
who's been feeding Stella?

46:19.013 --> 46:22.851
I dunno.

46:22.853 --> 46:24.723
S'pose she's been feeding herself.
