 Ah, yes, but none more precise
 than the ninja method.

01:39.165 --> 01:42.165
 I suppose that means that we're
 doing ninja myths again.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.404
 Indeed, you are correct,

01:45.405 --> 01:48.240
 Three is the number of myths
 we must test in this journey.

01:48.241 --> 01:51.176
 The first is underwater
 blow-dart assassination.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.612

 the famous one-inch punch.

 catch an arrow again,

 -Nice work.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.556
 Why, thank you.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.458
 NARRATOR:
 Unlike the samurai,

02:06.459 --> 02:09.459
 ninjas don't have
 a fighting code.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.762
 They just do whatever it takes
 to get the job done.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.667
 Their ruthless dispatch
 of enemies

02:15.668 --> 02:17.436
 spawned a rich mythology,

02:17.437 --> 02:20.437
 and that's why they're familiar
 territory to the Mythbusters.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.510
 But ninja rep took a nose dive

02:24.511 --> 02:27.511
 when Adam and Jamie proved
 ninjas couldn't walk on water...

 with their bare hands.

 when the boys proved

02:37.891 --> 02:40.891
 shadow warriors had no show
 of catching a full-flight arrow.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.929
 Myth is busted. This is what
 it would take to catch an arrow.

 [ Aaah! ]

03:00.914 --> 03:02.514
 What did they say we got wrong?

03:02.515 --> 03:05.515
 Well, the fans complained that
 our robo-arrow-catching hand

03:05.518 --> 03:08.518
 was way too close to our
 robo-arrow-shooting bow

03:08.588 --> 03:09.955
 and that if it was farther away,

03:09.956 --> 03:12.591
 they reasoned the arrow
 would be going slower

03:12.592 --> 03:14.660
 and that would make it easier
 to catch.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.695
 That's easy enough to test.
 Is that it?

03:16.696 --> 03:17.796
 Sadly, no.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.299
 Tons of people wrote us
 and said they've seen footage

 one of those people

 So we've got to get a real ninja
 and bring him on the show.

 I don't know
 where we're gonna find one,

03:29.976 --> 03:31.343
 but, yeah, I think we have to.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.312
 NARRATOR: We'll let them
 find that ninja later

03:33.313 --> 03:36.313
 and start
 with the arrow-speed test.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.218
 ADAM:
 One of the primary complaints

03:39.219 --> 03:40.786
 was that we were firing
 all of our arrows

03:40.787 --> 03:43.355
 for the arrow-catch test
 from too close --

03:43.356 --> 03:44.590
 from point-blank range --

03:44.591 --> 03:46.391
 and that if the arrows
 were going from farther away,

03:46.392 --> 03:49.392
 they'd be going slower
 and thus be easier to catch.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.997
 Well, our understanding
 of the physics is,

03:51.998 --> 03:54.998
 there's very little difference
 between 10 feet and 50 feet.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.770
 And we're about to do some tests
 that hopefully will prove that.

 Jamie will fire arrows
 at increments of 10 feet.

 JAMIE: In this test, we're gonna
 use the high-speed camera

04:06.546 --> 04:08.647
 and this scale to measure
 the speed of the arrow

04:08.648 --> 04:10.415

 a full-strength pull

04:16.089 --> 04:19.089
 on each arrow.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.827

 you killed something, sir.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.206
 NARRATOR:
 Now, where did that arrow go?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.174
 All right, this is 70 feet.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.176
 I thought this was
 a ninja special,

04:38.177 --> 04:39.711
 not knight special.

04:39.712 --> 04:42.712
 This is what I had
 lying around. Go!

 -Oh!
 -JAMIE: That ought to work.

 So, what did they find out?

04:48.221 --> 04:51.221
 Well, we did pretty good.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.659
 Uh, there's effectively
 no difference.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.061

 consistently between

04:56.062 --> 04:59.062
 171 and 179 miles per hour.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.434
 So, what this means for our
 tests is that it doesn't matter

05:04.671 --> 05:07.139
 how far away the shooter is
 from the catcher.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.675

 about the same speed.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.418
 They were.
 It's true.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.952
 This is something
 we've known about for a while,

05:20.953 --> 05:22.621
 and I'm really glad
 we got to show it on the show --

05:22.622 --> 05:25.622
 that the speed of an aerodynamic
 projectile like an arrow

05:26.025 --> 05:28.260
 has a very low drop-off
 in speed

05:28.261 --> 05:29.761
 from the moment
 it leaves the shooter

05:29.762 --> 05:31.296
 to the moment
 it hits its target.

05:31.297 --> 05:34.297
 That means we were right,
 and the fans were wrong.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.501
 I guess if you want to harp
 on that, yes, that's true.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.173
 Now I think
 we can put this one away.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.141
 And it's time to bring out
 our real ninja.

05:43.142 --> 05:46.142

 his non-ninja appearance

06:34.560 --> 06:36.628
 We're gonna put him
 into our "holodeck" here

 and run him through some of his
 paces to see what he can do.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.700
 NARRATOR:
 So, is our ninja fast enough

06:41.701 --> 06:44.701
 to catch a full-speed arrow?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.273
 Well, there's only one way
 to find out --

06:48.274 --> 06:51.274
 see if he can catch...
 tennis balls?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.079
 A thoughtful person
 might just ask,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.480
 "What does catching one of these

06:55.481 --> 06:57.649
 have to do
 with catching one of these?"

06:57.650 --> 07:00.152
 Well, it's all about
 reaction time,

07:00.153 --> 07:02.621
 and Anthony has fast reflexes.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.289
 That's what this is about.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.290
 NARRATOR: So before the ninja
 catches any arrows,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.360
 they're going to measure
 the speed of his handiwork.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.398
 Okay, I'm gonna keep time
 on the stopwatch

07:13.399 --> 07:14.466

 And go!

07:23.142 --> 07:24.342
 -Hyah!
 -One.

07:24.343 --> 07:27.343
 NARRATOR: But those balls are
 traveling at 85 miles an hour.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.315
 ADAM:
 That's more or less the speed

07:30.316 --> 07:32.884
 of a major-league fastball.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.886
 But at 26 feet away,

 to the pitcher.

07:37.223 --> 07:37.989

07:37.990 --> 07:40.625
 The ninja has less than
 a fifth of a second to react.

 If he blinks, he'll miss it.

 Five seconds.

 Oh, goodness me!

07:51.537 --> 07:52.938

 This could be
 a new world record.

 on high-speed camera --

08:00.046 --> 08:03.046
 Anthony catching that ball
 as it comes into him.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.384
 Apparently,
 he has set a new world record.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.587
 We'll see how Adam does.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.223
 NARRATOR:
 A ninja arrow is hot stuff,

08:11.224 --> 08:14.224
 but can a shadow warrior
 catch one in full flight?

08:14.961 --> 08:16.728
 To find out, a real ninja

 it looked too difficult.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.671
 I have to try this.
 Can I try this?

08:26.672 --> 08:29.672
 NARRATOR: And Jamie
 is more than happy to oblige.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.209
 Hah!

08:31.210 --> 08:33.211
 We all know I don't have
 any particular problem

08:33.212 --> 08:35.847

 to Adam.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.682
 Oh! God!

 Pain is your friend.

 You want to try it?

 No.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.599
 Dude, I'm all red.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.534
 It's not as bad
 as the paintball,

09:29.535 --> 09:32.470
 but it's definitely gonna hurt.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.471
 NARRATOR: Replays of Adam's
 slow-motion suffering...

 ninja school any time soon.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.783
 ADAM:
 This absolutely confirms

09:44.784 --> 09:46.284
 why we brought Anthony
 on the show.

09:46.285 --> 09:49.285
 And this is why I'm no longer
 the one trying to catch arrows.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.231
 So, ninjas, what do we got?

10:00.232 --> 10:03.232
 This is a classic ninja myth
 that's all about assassination.

10:03.302 --> 10:06.302
 But this is specifically
 an underwater ambush.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.139
 So imagine you have a target.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.941
 The only time he's unprotected

10:09.942 --> 10:12.377
 is when he takes
 his morning walk by the lake.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.211
 Okay.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.113
 You grab some poison darts
 and a blowgun,

10:15.114 --> 10:16.381
 you hang out
 underneath the water,

10:16.382 --> 10:19.382
 and when your target walks by
 [blows] you attack.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.821
 So you're using your blow-dart
 gun as a breathing tube.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.756
 -Exactly.
 -That's wild.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.757
 It's like a ninja!

10:28.594 --> 10:30.996
 NARRATOR:
 In their art-of-stealth arsenal,

10:30.997 --> 10:33.997
 the blowgun, or fukiya,
 was a ninja's deadly weapon.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.269
 But does the myth of doubling
 as a snorkel hold water?

10:43.342 --> 10:46.342
 The story goes, a shadow warrior
 would slip into a pond,

10:47.713 --> 10:50.713
 stay hidden for hours, breathing
 easy through his blow tube.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.220
 When his unsuspecting target
 finally turned up,

10:55.221 --> 10:58.221
 the ninja's poison dart would
 quickly carry out its carnage.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.325
 Aaah!

11:00.326 --> 11:01.960
 All right,
 this is pretty complicated,

11:01.961 --> 11:04.329
 so let's break it down
 into its elements.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.864
 All right, well, first of all,
 we need to see

11:05.865 --> 11:07.832
 how long somebody
 can stay underwater,

11:07.833 --> 11:10.135
 because if you're underneath the
 water for a long period of time,

11:10.136 --> 11:12.404
 there's a possibility
 you could get hypothermia.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.806
 And we need to see if we can
 build an accurate blowgun

11:14.807 --> 11:17.409
 using only the materials that
 an ancient ninja would have.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.644
 And we need to find out
 if you can aim underwater,

11:19.645 --> 11:21.446
 because you need to correct
 for refraction.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.049
 Then, the hard part is gonna be
 breathing through the blowgun,

11:24.050 --> 11:26.151
 loading the dart while
 you're underneath the water,

11:26.152 --> 11:27.519
 and then making
 that lethal shot.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.520
 NARRATOR: So first up, Tory is
 gonna put his life on the line.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.558
 KARI: Stop right there.
 That's good.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.559
 Today we're gonna test
 exposure to cold water.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.563
 And to do that,
 Tory has kindly volunteered

11:41.233 --> 11:44.233
 to jump into our tank
 of 66-degree-temperature water.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.340
 NARRATOR: That's about the
 average temperature of a lake

11:49.341 --> 11:51.476
 in Japan during fall.

11:51.477 --> 11:54.477
 But they're not throwing Tory
 completely into the deep end.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.115
 -Here you go, buddy.
 -KARI: Ew, it smells, too.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.150
 NARRATOR:
 He will have some protection.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.552
 TORY:
 Well, apparently,

12:00.553 --> 12:02.954
 ninjas used to rub animal fat
 all over their bodies

12:02.955 --> 12:05.623
 and then put a leather suit on
 before they got into cold water

12:05.624 --> 12:07.959
 to act as, like, a wet suit.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.960
 All right, you're gonna write
 on this board how you feel.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.932
 One is you're okay,
 you're good to go,

12:13.933 --> 12:14.999
 all the way up to 10,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.202
 which is, "I think
 I've got hypothermia.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.703
 Get me out of here now."

12:18.704 --> 12:19.704
 NARRATOR:
 Sounds easy enough.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.474
 All right, 3, 2, 1...

12:22.475 --> 12:25.475

12:26.145 --> 12:27.679
 [ Muffled screaming ]

12:27.680 --> 12:29.547
 KARI: Quite honestly,
 under that cold water,

12:29.548 --> 12:31.316
 I don't think
 Tory is gonna last very long.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.451
 I feel like 10, 15 minutes,

12:33.452 --> 12:35.320
 and he's just gonna be cold
 and have to get out.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.788
 NARRATOR:
 In water this cold,

12:36.789 --> 12:39.758
 he could die
 in as little as two hours.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.759
 And just 10 minutes in,
 Tory is already struggling.

12:44.196 --> 12:47.196
 GRANT: Let's ask him
 what number he's at.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.733

 Five. He's colder.

 paramedics are on standby.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.575
 They know what to look for.

12:57.576 --> 13:00.311
 Symptoms of hypothermia

13:11.290 --> 13:13.825

 so it's gonna be
 a little tough for us to tell.

 to pick when he's underwater,

 for 45 chilly minutes.

 You lasted an hour. I didn't
 think it would be that long.

 Considering you don't have
 any cold-water training,

 for this myth.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.810
 Now, maybe holding seven world's
 records in catching stuff

14:40.813 --> 14:42.981
 and the fact that he calls
 himself "the Arrow Catcher"

14:42.982 --> 14:44.682
 has something to do with that,

 I mean, metal is "natural."

18:39.751 --> 18:42.751
 It does come from this Earth,
 so not entirely cheating.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.157
 NARRATOR:
 Three different blowguns.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.192
 Three different ninjas.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.193
 Only one will win the right
 to be the underwater assassin.

18:52.164 --> 18:55.164
 All right,
 here's dart number one.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.235

18:58.604 --> 19:00.438
 [ Blowing ]

19:00.439 --> 19:02.673
 You're really accurate if you're
 aiming for the background.

19:02.674 --> 19:05.674
 NARRATOR: That's three darts
 close, but no cigar.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.547
 Now, Grant's
 natural-material blowgun

19:09.548 --> 19:11.682
 has had
 a last-minute alteration.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.683
 Well, if you want accuracy,
 you should try the laser sight.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.187
 Grant's got a laser sight
 on his.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.522
 -Wait a minute.
 -I know!

19:17.523 --> 19:19.023
 Did ninjas have lasers?

19:19.024 --> 19:20.291
 Hey, no.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.360
 Modern ninjas do.

19:22.361 --> 19:25.163
 NARRATOR: Laser sights
 have some advantages...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.231
 and some disadvantages.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.033
 -Ow!
 -Oh, don't look down the barrel!

19:29.034 --> 19:30.935
 Don't look down the barrel!
 Ohh!

19:30.936 --> 19:33.936
 It's a self-sabotaging
 blow-dart gun.

 Step up to the plate.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.676
 I got to save the palace.
 Step back. Step back.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.444
 NARRATOR:
 If Kari can't score,

 they'll have no weapon
 to test the myth.

 -Two out of three ain't bad.
 -Nice work.

 I think you definitely won.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.829
 I totally cheated.

 -What?!
 -What?!

20:03.001 --> 20:05.870
 Oh, you so cheated!

20:05.871 --> 20:08.871
 Coming from the man
 with the laser sight!

20:09.474 --> 20:11.409
 NARRATOR:
 Now, there are sore losers...

20:11.410 --> 20:13.311
 I'm the master ninja 

20:13.312 --> 20:15.980

 there's Grant and Tory.

 [ Blows ]

20:18.417 --> 20:20.284
 See that?

20:20.285 --> 20:21.819
 That's without cheating.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.522
 Kari might be
 the master ninja now.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.124
 We'll see tomorrow
 when she's underwater.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.359
 They were really mad.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.694
 [ Men shouting ]

20:29.695 --> 20:32.695
 They're...
 kind of scaring me now.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.700
 NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
 are pitting science

20:35.701 --> 20:38.636
 against the shadow warrior.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.637
 So far, the ninja has proven
 he can indeed catch an arrow.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.343
 Good work.
 Thanks, Jamie.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.044
 NARRATOR:
 But even before the fan chorus

20:47.045 --> 20:49.313
 of told-you-sos had subsided,

20:49.314 --> 20:52.314
 the Mythbusters
 were flagging a foul.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.417
 So how did he do?
 Did our ninja catch the arrow?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.754
 Well, technically, yes,
 but he had some requirements.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.592
 I had to stand
 at a set distance.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.794
 I had to shoot the arrow
 in front of him,

21:03.795 --> 21:06.030
 where his hand was gonna be,
 not at him.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.031
 And I couldn't pull the bow back
 to its full draw.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.902
 I had to kind of
 do it like this.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.271
 Yeah, I think
 what we need to do

21:13.272 --> 21:15.806
 is give our fans
 a cold, hard dose

21:15.807 --> 21:17.808
 of battle-hardened reality.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.977
 Those bows need to be drawn
 at full strength.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.813
 Those arrows need to be aimed
 directly at our ninja,

21:22.814 --> 21:24.982
 and he can't know
 from which direction

21:24.983 --> 21:26.684
 the deadly arrow is gonna come.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.085
 Basically,
 you're trying to kill him.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.787
 Yeah, pretty much.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.788
 NARRATOR: Let's hope the ninja
 has good health insurance.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.160
 Look, our ninja caught
 the arrow. He totally did.

21:36.161 --> 21:39.063
 But that's not the myth
 we're talking about.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.598
 We're talking about
 a ninja in battle.

21:40.599 --> 21:43.401
 He hears an arrow being released
 from its string --

21:43.402 --> 21:46.137
 [ Whistles ] Ching!
 And he plucks it out of the air.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.839
 That's what we want to see,
 and that's the kind of scenario

21:48.840 --> 21:50.841
 we're about to set up
 for Anthony.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.511
 NARRATOR: To test
 the ninja's maximum mettle,

21:53.512 --> 21:56.512
 Adam and Jamie
 have created a battle zone.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.382
 JAMIE:
 In a real battle situation,

21:58.383 --> 21:59.784
 there may be multiple archers,

21:59.785 --> 22:02.253
 and you're not gonna know
 who's firing when.

22:02.254 --> 22:05.122
 So that's what
 we've got to replicate next.

22:05.123 --> 22:07.692
 NARRATOR: The plan is to use
 three archers --

22:07.693 --> 22:10.594
 Jamie and two secret shooters,

22:10.595 --> 22:13.064
 all firing
 straight at the ninja's body.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.833
 Soon our ninja will know...

22:15.834 --> 22:17.335
...the Mythbusters' challenge!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.804
 NARRATOR: This time,
 Adam is making damn sure

22:19.805 --> 22:22.340
 the odds are stacked
 in his favor.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.341
 His secret shooters
 are the ninjas' nemesis --

22:25.944 --> 22:27.712
 other ninjas.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.713
 These are our ninja archers.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.550
 I can't tell you who they are.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.551
 If you knew,
 you'd already be dead.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.389
 NARRATOR: Now, there's just
 one slight problem

22:38.390 --> 22:41.390
 with firing lethal arrows
 at a ninja.

22:41.626 --> 22:44.626
 It's that they are, well...

22:46.031 --> 22:47.798
...lethal.

22:47.799 --> 22:50.799
 That seriously needs sorting,
 so back at base,

22:51.136 --> 22:54.136
 Adam is building
 some less-than-lethal arrows.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.941
 We'll see.
 Here we go.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.942
 3, 2, 1...

23:00.445 --> 23:02.947
 NARRATOR: Adam's arrow
 went into the ninja,

23:02.948 --> 23:05.948
 but the lethal metal tip didn't.

23:06.251 --> 23:07.985
 Oh.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.154
 It didn't go through the thing.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.555
 NARRATOR:
 It seems safe,

23:11.556 --> 23:14.556
 but he won't be the one
 on the not-so-pointy end.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.062
 With rubber-tipped arrows,
 the ninja won't die.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.030
 But will he be able
 to catch them

23:20.031 --> 23:23.031
 and defeat the forces of evil
 ranged against him.

23:23.368 --> 23:26.368
 It's a classic shadow-warrior
 showdown -- a lone ninja...

 would be assured.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.720
 Ugh! Hyah!

23:42.721 --> 23:44.688

 But this isn't a movie.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.123
 Hyah!

23:46.124 --> 23:48.893
 NARRATOR:
 It's more like a firing squad.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.227
 Wah!

23:50.228 --> 23:53.228
 NARRATOR: And the ninja
 just took three direct hits.

23:53.698 --> 23:54.765
 ADAM:
 Okay, stand down.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.766
 Well, Anthony is absolutely
 a good sport...

23:59.104 --> 24:02.039
...but so far,
 under battle conditions,

24:02.040 --> 24:04.442
 it's not looking good
 for the myth.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.110
 No arrows have been caught.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.812
 Archers, draw.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.680
 NARRATOR:
 At this range, with no cover,

24:09.681 --> 24:12.681
 the ninja is a sitting duck.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.955
 So Adam decides to give him
 a bit more room to move.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.824
 ADAM:
 Okay, all right, stand down.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.660
 In the interest of giving
 Anthony an even better chance,

24:22.661 --> 24:25.563
 I'm gonna back up all three
 of the archers 10 paces --

24:25.564 --> 24:27.031
 another 10 meters --

24:27.032 --> 24:29.600
 so they'll all be
 at about 60 feet away from him

24:29.601 --> 24:32.002
 before they fire.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.871
 [ Grunting ]

24:33.872 --> 24:36.872
 NARRATOR: At a greater distance,
 the archers are less accurate.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.643
 Hyah!

24:39.644 --> 24:42.046
 NARRATOR:
 And the ninja gets close...

24:42.047 --> 24:43.481
 Ohh.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.283
 NARRATOR:... but still
 can't quite get a grip.

24:46.284 --> 24:49.019
 All right, stand down.
 Let's reset.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.020
 NARRATOR: The myth is looking
 like it's totally busted.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.825
 But to settle it
 once and for all,

24:54.826 --> 24:56.794
 Adam has one more option.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.663
 ADAM: I want to give Anthony the
 best chance of success at this,

24:59.664 --> 25:02.566
 so I'm gonna have the archers
 all holding their arrows down

25:02.567 --> 25:03.734
 until they fire,

25:03.735 --> 25:06.070
 so he'll actually have
 a little bit of lead time

25:06.071 --> 25:09.071
 seeing the flutter of their bow
 before they fire.

25:09.608 --> 25:12.608
 Ha!

 He finally caught one.

25:20.719 --> 25:21.485
 Hah!

25:21.486 --> 25:24.486
 NARRATOR: So, is it a case
 of myth busted or plausible?

25:25.824 --> 25:27.024
 JAMIE:
 In a battle scenario,

25:27.025 --> 25:29.260
 Anthony was, in fact,
 able to catch an arrow,

25:29.261 --> 25:32.261
 although,
 in a real battle situation,

25:32.797 --> 25:34.698
 you only have one chance,

25:34.699 --> 25:37.699
 and Anthony took a number
 of hits before he got it right.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.339
 Our ninja did spectacularly

25:42.340 --> 25:44.875
 when he could see an archer
 go up and release.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.111
 He had the time to anticipate.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.379
 Hah!

25:48.380 --> 25:51.380
 But without that, I think
 we'd have one dead ninja.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.585
 NARRATOR: When it comes
 to fighting underwater,

25:54.586 --> 25:57.321
 you can do it the hard way...

25:57.322 --> 26:00.090
...or the ninja way.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.560
 Use your blowpipe
 as a breathing tube

26:02.561 --> 26:05.062
 and fire a poison dart
 into your victim.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.397
 Aaah!

26:06.398 --> 26:08.599
 So despite the cheating...

26:08.600 --> 26:10.801
 we did establish
 that it's possible

26:10.802 --> 26:13.637
 to make an accurate blowgun
 using only natural materials.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.773
 TORY: We also showed that you
 could stay underneath the water

26:15.774 --> 26:17.942
 for an hour,
 which would be plenty of time

26:17.943 --> 26:19.843
 for you to wait
 for your enemy to come by.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.378
 So I guess it's time
 to put it all together.

26:21.379 --> 26:22.713
 This is where
 it gets really hard,

26:22.714 --> 26:25.683
 because underwater, refraction
 is gonna distort your aim.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.685
 And even if you could
 overcome the refraction,

26:27.686 --> 26:29.820
 you still have to
 load the dart in the blowgun

26:29.821 --> 26:31.055
 while breathing.

 into something less comfortable.

26:40.832 --> 26:42.099
 So how are we
 gonna test this one?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.335
 All right, well, since
 this is all about accuracy,

26:44.336 --> 26:45.436
 I think what you should do

26:45.437 --> 26:47.938
 is put the dart in the tube
 first while you're above water

26:47.939 --> 26:49.707
 and then pop down under.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.241
 [ Blows ]
 Do it that way.

26:51.242 --> 26:53.344
 All right.
 Get in the water.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.145
 NARRATOR: As the winner
 from yesterday's test,

26:55.146 --> 26:58.146
 it's Kari's job to take aim
 from under the water,

26:58.483 --> 27:01.483
 where things
 may not be so clear.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.521
 It's a different thing
 when you're above water

27:04.522 --> 27:07.291
 versus being underwater,
 because of refraction,

27:07.292 --> 27:09.627
 which, if we're correct,

27:09.628 --> 27:11.495
 will probably make it
 very difficult

27:11.496 --> 27:14.264
 to actually aim for a target
 and hit it.

27:14.265 --> 27:16.934
 NARRATOR: The problem
 for our trespassing assassin

27:16.935 --> 27:19.935
 is the emperor she's aiming at
 isn't where he appears to be.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.440
 That's because light
 travels at different speeds

27:23.441 --> 27:24.942
 through water and air,

27:24.943 --> 27:27.943
 getting bent out of shape as it
 passes from one to the other.

 where to fire.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.832
 It's really blurry.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.833

 only fighting refraction here.

 Breathing through the blowgun
 comes later.

 -[ Pole clangs ]

27:57.442 --> 27:58.876
 TORY: Whoa!

27:58.877 --> 28:01.245
 -You hit the pole.
 -lt was high.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.579
 Yeah, lower your aim
 a little bit.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.748
 Oh, wow. I thought
 I was way lower than that.

28:04.749 --> 28:07.749
 All right, refraction aim test,
 take three.

28:08.153 --> 28:11.153
 NARRATOR:
 So, will it be third time lucky?

28:11.690 --> 28:12.656
 -[ Blows ]
 -[ Thud ]

28:12.657 --> 28:15.259
 -Whoa!
 -Whoa! That's a great shot.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.428
 A really good shot, and that was
 only your third try.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.429
 NARRATOR:
 Ah, the sweet smell of success.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.567
 KARI: The refraction test went
 so much better than I expected.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.969
 I thought that maybe
 I could hit the target,

28:25.970 --> 28:28.238
 but I didn't think
 I could sit underwater,

28:28.239 --> 28:31.239
 see the target,
 and really aim for it.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.511
 NARRATOR: They've got traction
 on refraction,

28:34.512 --> 28:37.512
 but what about breathing below
 before they blow?

28:38.650 --> 28:41.650
 That's their ultimate challenge.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.921
 KARI: In the interest
 of a bigger sample size,

28:43.922 --> 28:45.389
 I think we should all do this,

28:45.390 --> 28:46.657
 so I think
 you should go ninja up.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.658
 Yeah!
 Time to be ninjas!

28:49.761 --> 28:52.229
 NARRATOR: Once again,
 like thieves in the night,

28:52.230 --> 28:55.230
 our stealth warriors
 sneakily slip into action.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.202
 Well, one of them, anyway.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.938
 Now, we've already proven
 that you can stand the cold.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.474
 Kari is compensating
 for refraction,

29:03.475 --> 29:05.075
 and her targeting is right on.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.211
 Now it's time
 to put everything together

29:07.212 --> 29:10.212
 and do it all at once
 to see if it's really possible.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.149
 In 3, 2, 1.

29:16.387 --> 29:17.554
 NARRATOR:
 This is it.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.555
 This is why our would-be
 assassins are here --

29:20.592 --> 29:21.959
 to see if they can breathe

29:21.960 --> 29:23.660
 through their blowguns
 long enough

29:23.661 --> 29:26.661
 to get a secret shot
 at their hapless victim.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.999
 And for this experiment,
 long enough is 10 minutes.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.204
 TORY: Now we've tested
 all the elements.

29:34.205 --> 29:35.773
 Now the final test is to see

29:35.774 --> 29:38.542
 if we can load our dart
 underneath the water

29:38.543 --> 29:41.345
 and then fire
 and hit our target.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.447
 NARRATOR:
 This is the really hard part --

29:43.448 --> 29:46.448
 feeding then firing their darts
 out of a tube

29:46.718 --> 29:49.718
 they're supposed to be
 breathing through.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.392
 Trouble is, once you take
 your mouth away,

29:55.393 --> 29:58.393
 the water rushes in...

29:59.130 --> 30:02.130
 [ Laughs ]

30:02.267 --> 30:05.267
 NARRATOR:... and your blowgun
 becomes a water pistol.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.639
 -[ Coughs ]
 -Where did it go?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.874
 [ Coughs ]
 I don't know.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.377
 NARRATOR: It's a no-show
 from the big blow.

30:13.378 --> 30:16.013
 Do our ninjas lack the knack?

30:16.014 --> 30:19.014
 Is the task too big an ask?

30:19.517 --> 30:22.517
 Hyah!

30:28.326 --> 30:29.359
 Next.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.062
 Next is the ninja
 one-inch punch.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.431
 Made famous
 by the legendary Bruce Lee.

30:34.432 --> 30:36.099
 Exactly the one.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.602
 The myth is that,
 in the right hands,

30:38.603 --> 30:40.838
 a ninja whose fist
 is only this far away

30:40.839 --> 30:43.173
 can still floor an opponent,
 and we're in luck,

30:43.174 --> 30:46.174
 because our ninja has been
 trained in the one-inch punch

30:46.511 --> 30:49.446
 by one of Bruce Lee's
 own students.

30:49.447 --> 30:52.149
 NARRATOR: Now, before they test
 the ninja's one-inch weapon,

30:52.150 --> 30:55.150
 Adam and Jamie want to measure
 how hard a normal punch is.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.921
 JAMIE: Give me your best shot!
 Come on!

30:57.922 --> 30:59.656
 NARRATOR:
 Last time punches were thrown,

30:59.657 --> 31:01.725
 Adam got to sock Jamie.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.126
 ADAM:
 Ready? Aah!

31:03.127 --> 31:04.261
 JAMIE:
 That was a hard one.

31:04.262 --> 31:07.064
 NARRATOR: So it's Jamie's turn
 to thump Adam

31:07.065 --> 31:09.399
 and then see
 how his full-force punch

31:09.400 --> 31:12.400
 stacks up against
 the ninja's one-inch wonder.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.605
 ADAM:
 Now, there's been

31:14.606 --> 31:16.039
 some concern
 from our insurance company

31:16.040 --> 31:17.808
 about getting punched
 in the chest

31:17.809 --> 31:19.209
 because it's where
 your heart is.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.979
 That's why I'm wearing
 this big, red man suit.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.014
 Then we've got a load plate,
 and then we've got some padding

31:24.015 --> 31:26.750
 on the load plate to protect
 Jamie's sensitive hands,

31:26.751 --> 31:29.751
 'cause in his spare time,
 he's a hand model.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.455
 NARRATOR: Whoops.

31:31.456 --> 31:33.290
 Oh, there he is.
 [ Laughs ]

31:33.291 --> 31:36.193
 NARRATOR: Well, if he wasn't mad
 enough to punch Adam out before,

31:36.194 --> 31:37.761
 he sure is now.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.963
 [ Dog growling ]

31:39.964 --> 31:42.964
 So, just what sort of punch
 does Jamie pack?

31:44.068 --> 31:45.903
 Give me a full-force punch.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.538
 NARRATOR:
 It's payback time.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.573
 Ohh!

31:49.574 --> 31:51.308
 Ohh! [ Chuckles ]

31:51.309 --> 31:52.442
 Ohh!

31:52.443 --> 31:54.878
 -What was the reading?
 -325 pounds.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.281
 NARRATOR:
 At 325 pounds,

31:57.282 --> 32:00.282
 if Jamie's fist had been
 delivered to Adam's jaw,

32:00.285 --> 32:02.386
 it'd be a knockout.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.620
 Ow.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.222
 [ Laughs ]

32:05.223 --> 32:07.691
 NARRATOR: With their
 baseline set, it's time to see

32:07.692 --> 32:10.692
 how many pounds of punch
 the ninja can muster

32:11.062 --> 32:12.930
 from only one inch away.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.498
 Okay, Adam, are you ready?

32:14.499 --> 32:16.800
 Give it everything you've got.

32:16.801 --> 32:17.935
 Hah!

32:17.936 --> 32:18.969
 Hah!

32:18.970 --> 32:20.270
 Hah!

32:20.271 --> 32:22.239
 -Dennis, what was the reading?
 -153.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.474
 NARRATOR: That's half
 of what Jamie racked up

32:24.475 --> 32:25.742
 at full throttle.

32:25.743 --> 32:26.810
 Ohh!

32:26.811 --> 32:29.479
 But still not hugely powerful.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.048
 Yeah, but is the one-inch punch

32:31.049 --> 32:33.283
 actually a weapon
 in the ninja's arsenal?

32:33.284 --> 32:36.284
 Yes, it is, but more common
 is the three-inch power punch.

32:36.554 --> 32:38.221
 Let me demonstrate that for you.

32:38.222 --> 32:39.656
 Okay, it goes like this.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.657
 The hand rolls in,
 and we hit here like so.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.495
 Okay.
 I'm ready if you are.

32:45.496 --> 32:46.596
 Okay.

32:46.597 --> 32:47.531
 Hyah!

32:47.532 --> 32:48.265
 Hyah!

32:48.266 --> 32:49.733
 Hyah!

32:49.734 --> 32:51.201
 210 pounds.

32:51.202 --> 32:52.502
 -210!
 -Now we're getting there.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.503
 NARRATOR: The high-speed
 shows the force of the punch.

32:56.007 --> 32:59.007
 And at two-thirds the power
 of Jamie's knockout blow,

32:59.978 --> 33:02.978
 it'd more than likely
 floor an opponent.

33:03.047 --> 33:03.714
 Hyah!

33:03.715 --> 33:04.448
 Hyah!

33:04.449 --> 33:07.117
 NARRATOR: But where
 the ninja's precision punching

33:07.118 --> 33:08.485
 really showed...

33:08.486 --> 33:09.953
 Hyah!

33:09.954 --> 33:12.556
 NARRATOR:... was when he broke
 the last of three boards...

33:12.557 --> 33:13.790
 Hyah!

33:13.791 --> 33:16.059
 NARRATOR:
...leaving the first two intact.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.495
 Hyah!

33:18.496 --> 33:21.465
 Imagine what would happen
 to your internal organs

33:21.466 --> 33:24.466
 if you were on the receiving end
 of this.

33:27.438 --> 33:29.573
 And that was one punch...

33:29.574 --> 33:30.741
 No more of that.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.876
 NARRATOR:
...even Jamie couldn't match.

33:32.877 --> 33:35.877
 No, I don't see
 any damage, Jamie...

33:36.214 --> 33:38.215
 except to you.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.583
 [ Laughs ]

33:39.584 --> 33:42.052
 How are we gonna call
 the one-inch punch?

33:42.053 --> 33:43.553
 I'd have to say it's plausible.

33:43.554 --> 33:46.554
 While it'll never be as powerful
 as a full-on punch,

33:46.858 --> 33:48.392
 Anthony was actually
 able to generate

33:48.393 --> 33:50.193
 an impressive amount of force
 at that range.

33:50.194 --> 33:50.894
 I agree.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.329
 With the proper amount
 of training

33:52.330 --> 33:54.331
 and catching your opponent
 off guard,

33:54.332 --> 33:56.933
 you could totally knock
 someone down with what he did.

33:56.934 --> 33:59.934
 -I say plausible.
 -Plausible.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.877
 NARRATOR: Laying an ambush
 aboveground is hard enough.

34:09.414 --> 34:11.313
 [ Gunshots ]

34:11.315 --> 34:14.315
 But can a ninja
 blowgun-breathing assassin

34:14.485 --> 34:16.585
 do it from underwater?

34:16.587 --> 34:19.188
 That's what Tory, Kari,
 and Grant are testing.

34:19.190 --> 34:22.190
 But so far, all they've blown
 out of the water is...

34:22.293 --> 34:24.327
 [ Coughs ]

34:24.328 --> 34:25.762
 NARRATOR:
...more water.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.496
 All right, we're gonna
 have to blow harder.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.433
 Actually, I was
 thinking of this.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.333
 You've only got poison
 at the tip, right?

34:31.335 --> 34:33.303
 So what if you have the end
 in your mouth

34:33.304 --> 34:35.572
 and you kind of hold on to it
 like this with your teeth

34:35.572 --> 34:38.108
 and then breathe through your
 teeth, and then you load it?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.010
 That way, there's never
 a water transition.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.746
 Sure, whatever works.
 We need to assassinate this guy.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.347
 [ Laughs ] Okay.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.449
 NARRATOR:
 So let's pucker up and see

34:46.451 --> 34:48.318
 if breathing
 through clenched teeth

34:48.319 --> 34:51.319
 is the ninja way
 to deliver death to the dummy.

34:58.463 --> 35:01.463
 That's a miss from Tory.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.200
 [ Gasps ]

35:03.201 --> 35:06.201
 NARRATOR: And Kari's cheating
 blowpipe has fallen to bits.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.971
 Oh, it didn't work out for me.

35:07.972 --> 35:10.407

 -I hit it!

 Good job!

35:20.485 --> 35:22.085

 the team goes for take two.

 -We got him!
 -Yeah!

35:46.177 --> 35:48.111
 TORY:
 This is totally plausible.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.613
 We covered all the elements.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.648
 You can survive the exposure
 to the cold.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.151
 And you can overcome refraction.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.218
 You know what?

35:55.219 --> 35:57.854
 If you put all three of us
 together, you'd get a ninja.

35:57.855 --> 36:00.855
 A very scary ninja.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.927
 We finally found a ninja myth
 that's plausible,

36:03.928 --> 36:05.629
 and we're not even
 trained ninjas.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.331
 I mean, could you imagine
 if we were trained ninjas?

36:08.332 --> 36:11.332
 KARI: The blow-dart experiment
 was phenomenal.

36:11.435 --> 36:14.204
 This is actually
 a plausible ninja myth.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.339
 I'm completely surprised.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.741
 Now I can go back
 to being a pirate,

36:17.742 --> 36:20.577
 'cause I'm not one
 for this ninja stuff.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.578
 It's cold.

36:30.888 --> 36:33.356
 NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
 are trying to put to rest

36:33.357 --> 36:36.357
 whether or not a ninja
 can grasp a passing shaft.

36:37.962 --> 36:40.962
 It's true -- when ambushed,
 the ninja did catch an arrow.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.166
 Hyah!

36:43.167 --> 36:46.167
 But he also caught
 more than a few with his body.

36:49.307 --> 36:52.307
 And then some.

36:52.577 --> 36:55.212
 But the ninja is real sore.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.213
 He says no shadow warrior
 would get cornered like this.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.050
 He wants a rematch with Adam,
 mano a mano.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.355
 ADAM:
 Our ninja has actually issued

37:05.356 --> 37:06.656
 what sounds like a challenge.

37:06.657 --> 37:09.526
 He says, in a battle situation,
 he wouldn't catch an arrow.

37:09.527 --> 37:12.527
 He'd deflect it, and I'd be dead
 before I got a second shot off.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.763
 I say, "Prove it, ninja." And
 that's what we're about to do.

37:16.133 --> 37:18.134
 We're gonna set up
 exactly that scenario

37:18.135 --> 37:20.237
 and see if I can get two shots
 off before I'm dead.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.238
 Here's the first one.

37:23.608 --> 37:26.209
 NARRATOR:
 It'll be an ugly grudge match.

37:26.210 --> 37:29.210
 There's a lot at stake,
 and Adam needs to save face...

37:30.381 --> 37:31.414
 Hyah!

37:31.415 --> 37:33.516
 Hah!

37:33.517 --> 37:36.517
 NARRATOR:... if there's anything
 left of his face to save.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.456
 This one's called
 ninja's revenge,

37:39.457 --> 37:41.625
 and it's all about the speed
 of reloading.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.960
 Now, let's face it --
 putting an an arrow onto a bow

37:43.961 --> 37:45.161
 is kind of fiddly,

37:45.162 --> 37:48.131
 and if you've got a ninja
 running at you full speed,

37:48.132 --> 37:49.699
 you might be
 in a little trouble --

37:49.700 --> 37:52.700
 or at least, so our ninja says.

37:52.803 --> 37:55.803
 NARRATOR: At 20 paces, it's
 Adam "Ninja Buster" Savage...

37:58.242 --> 38:01.242
...up against his archenemy,
 the Orange Avenger.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.481
 Oh. Ah.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.049
 JAMIE:
 Oh, you're dead.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.450
 [ Laughs ]
 You're dead.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.451
 Okay, you ready?

38:10.788 --> 38:13.788
 Hyaaaaaaah!

38:17.395 --> 38:19.562
 Hyaaah!

38:19.563 --> 38:20.597
 Haaah!

38:20.598 --> 38:22.132
 [ Laughs ]

38:22.133 --> 38:24.134
 JAMIE: You did get the nock
 on the string.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.670
 I got the nock on the string,
 but, man, ninja got to me.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.671
 No bananas.
 Thank you, my friend.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.741
 Well, look, I practiced,

38:31.742 --> 38:33.677
 and my arrow-shooting
 got pretty quick.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.346
 I was able to fire two shots
 in just under three seconds,

38:36.347 --> 38:39.347
 and that didn't even come close
 to helping me survive the ninja.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.785
 Not only did he cut my arrow
 in half, but I was cut down.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.556
 In my prime!

38:46.557 --> 38:48.325
 Adam was toast.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.227
 Although I have to say, this was
 a close-combat situation,

38:51.228 --> 38:54.228
 and if Adam
 was over 100 feet away,

38:54.699 --> 38:57.267
 there might be
 a different outcome.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.635
 NARRATOR:
 And the final score...

38:58.636 --> 39:00.036
 Hyah!

39:00.037 --> 39:03.037
 NARRATOR:
...Ninja 3, Adam's pride 0.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.043
 So, the fans say
 ninjas can catch arrows.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.578
 How are we gonna call this one?

39:08.579 --> 39:09.946
 I have an idea
 about how to answer

39:09.947 --> 39:11.314
 all the complaints
 we're gonna get from the fans.

39:11.315 --> 39:13.516
 I'm gonna role-play as the fans

39:13.517 --> 39:15.819
 and have a conversation
 with you as you.

39:15.820 --> 39:16.953
 Okay, I can do that.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.255
 Okay.
 [ Inhales, exhales sharply ]

39:19.256 --> 39:21.291
 Dude, he totally
 caught the arrow

39:21.292 --> 39:23.460
 even under your "impossible"
 battle conditions.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.428
 Once he saw the archer
 raise his bow,

39:25.429 --> 39:26.896
 whoop, he was able
 to grab that arrow.

39:26.897 --> 39:29.065
 Yeah, well,
 corpses can't catch arrows.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.867
 He'd been dead 20 times
 before that.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.503
 Yes, but think of all the arrows
 he avoided before then, too.

39:33.504 --> 39:34.637
 And under battle conditions,

39:34.638 --> 39:36.373
 the archers might not be drawing
 to full strength,

39:36.374 --> 39:38.742
 and things might be deflecting
 off walls and stuff like that.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.310
 He'd still be dead by then.

39:40.311 --> 39:43.311
 But remember the mano a mano
 when Adam shot the arrow at him,

39:43.581 --> 39:45.949
 and he was able to slice it
 out of the air with his sword?

39:45.950 --> 39:46.783
 Dead!

39:46.784 --> 39:49.619
 Okay, I can't do this anymore.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.620
 The myth is that a ninja
 could pluck an arrow --

39:52.923 --> 39:54.190
 he has no idea
 where it's coming from --

39:54.191 --> 39:55.959
 sense it coming and reach out --
 waa-chhh! --

39:55.960 --> 39:58.094
 and pluck an arrow
 out of the air.

39:58.095 --> 40:01.095
 Our ninja is arguably the best
 in the world at catching arrows,

40:01.432 --> 40:03.666
 and he couldn't do that.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.468
 If we had removed
 the rubber tips from our arrows,

40:05.469 --> 40:07.237
 we'd have one dead ninja
 on our hands.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.305
 -I say busted.
 -lt's busted.

40:09.306 --> 40:10.440
