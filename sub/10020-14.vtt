ER

00:06.955 --> 00:08.387
Previously on ER...

00:08.388 --> 00:09.831
They got you on oxigen?

00:09.887 --> 00:14.701
I need help living my life, Mark,
you'll be the first person I call.

00:14.702 --> 00:19.019
I mean, he did every crappy assignment
that the Navy wanted him to do.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.580
And it didn't matter. He never got the nod.

00:22.795 --> 00:24.796
- Oh. No, that's not what-
- You want to talk about this at dinner?

00:24.797 --> 00:27.472
- I made you feel uncomfortable.
- You didn't.

00:27.873 --> 00:30.147
Your father loves you very much, Mark.

00:32.131 --> 00:35.893
He may not show it in the way
that you want him to, but he does.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.722
"Family Practice"

00:43.480 --> 00:45.888
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to San Diego.

00:46.108 --> 00:50.437
Remain seated until the aircraft
has come to a full and complete stop.

00:52.155 --> 00:54.611
Flight 89 from Chicago has arrived.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.526
We apologize for the delay...

00:56.743 --> 01:00.788
...and will begin boarding for
continuation in just a few minutes.

01:19.682 --> 01:21.010
Mark?

01:21.725 --> 01:23.220
Dad, I told you I'd rent a car.

01:23.435 --> 01:27.683
Your mother appreciates you coming.
Wishes she could've called herself.

01:27.898 --> 01:30.223
- They get her knee wired?
- And put in a cast.

01:30.442 --> 01:33.396
I warned her not to use
that footstool like a stepladder.

01:33.612 --> 01:34.988
Were you there?

01:35.197 --> 01:37.070
I was out in the garage.

01:37.491 --> 01:39.150
I don't have any bags.
We can go.

01:39.368 --> 01:41.360
We've got to wait.
Your friend's coming.

01:41.578 --> 01:44.697
She tried to catch up with you
at O'Hare, but she missed you.

01:44.915 --> 01:45.994
What friend?

01:47.125 --> 01:48.619
Surprise!

01:50.837 --> 01:52.117
Hi, Mark.

01:52.630 --> 01:54.005
Hi.

01:56.593 --> 01:58.502
Dad, this is Cynthia Hooper.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.341
I hope you weren't just being
polite on the phone.

02:01.514 --> 02:05.808
Sounded like your hands were full,
and I just really wanted to help out.

02:06.018 --> 02:08.011
It's nice of you.
Here, let me take that.

02:08.187 --> 02:09.681
- Thanks.
- I got it.

02:09.854 --> 02:11.516
- How was your flight?
- It was great.

02:11.691 --> 02:14.727
Especially the landing.
I've never seen the Pacific before.

02:14.944 --> 02:16.023
Do you have luggage?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.445
I think I packed too much.

02:20.657 --> 02:22.531
You look like your dad.

02:24.494 --> 02:26.487
I can't believe they lost my bags.

02:26.706 --> 02:29.659
Your mom will be disappointed
if you don't stop by.

02:29.875 --> 02:33.374
- The new hospital looks nice.
- Best facility in the country.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.664
I couldn't let you do this alone.

02:35.881 --> 02:38.039
It's sweet, but what about
your shifts?

02:38.216 --> 02:41.051
I left a message for Kerry Weaver.
Mark, this is family.

02:41.219 --> 02:43.176
I know it's your family, but...

02:43.889 --> 02:45.881
Mrs. Greene. Mrs. Greene, please.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.054
- Be careful, please.
- No, don't make me stop.

02:49.810 --> 02:51.554
I thought sailors loved the cancan.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.096
- Hi, Mom.
- There you are!

02:54.315 --> 02:55.893
Oh, I'm so glad!

02:56.109 --> 02:58.066
- You okay?
- Look what I did.

02:58.277 --> 02:59.558
I'm so mad at myself.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.570
Well, accidents happen.

03:01.739 --> 03:05.819
All I can do is cancan,
and the corpsman says I can't cancan.

03:06.035 --> 03:07.280
Cancan.

03:07.995 --> 03:09.324
What meds is she on?

03:09.538 --> 03:10.653
Morphine and a benzo.

03:10.831 --> 03:12.740
- Ativan?
- Dr. Sayers is tapering her off.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.912
- Dr. Sayers? Is that her orthopod?
- He's the neurologist.

03:16.086 --> 03:18.922
- Why does she have a neurologist?
- Can I fill in your son?

03:19.131 --> 03:21.372
A mother has to have some
secrets, right?

03:22.592 --> 03:25.344
- Could you get him?
- I'll see who's on call.

03:26.596 --> 03:27.972
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:28.139 --> 03:29.302
This is Cynthia Hooper.

03:29.516 --> 03:31.058
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Greene.

03:31.226 --> 03:33.349
- You're getting married?
- No, we're not...

03:33.520 --> 03:35.346
...thinking about that now.

03:36.606 --> 03:39.394
- At least you're not a sourpuss.
- I hope not.

03:39.609 --> 03:41.732
His first wife had a real sour streak.

03:42.862 --> 03:46.362
Mark, as much as I hate to say it,
I'm afraid Rachel's got it too.

03:48.368 --> 03:50.905
- You can visit tomorrow.
- We gotta say good night.

03:51.079 --> 03:52.905
Okay, baby.
Night-night. Sweet dreams.

03:53.123 --> 03:55.411
- I love you.
- You too. See you tomorrow.

03:55.625 --> 03:58.411
- Nice meeting you.
- Good night. Bye-bye.

03:58.628 --> 04:00.869
- Good night, Mrs. Greene.
- Bye, sweetheart.

04:02.298 --> 04:05.085
I want to speak with Dr. Sayers,
on call or not.

04:05.259 --> 04:08.711
- Your mother's heavily medicated.
- That's not my mother.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.194
Did she hit her head
when she fell?

05:03.404 --> 05:06.906
For the fifth time, I have no idea.
She didn't mention it.

05:07.118 --> 05:09.361
Maybe something slid off
the shelf and hit her.

05:09.581 --> 05:12.155
- Dr. Sayers says it's normal.
- I disagree.

05:12.335 --> 05:15.871
- Looks like a little low-density to me.
- What would that mean?

05:16.090 --> 05:19.841
- She wasn't acting like this before?
- You mean being emotional and all?

05:20.054 --> 05:22.298
No, I mean being loony
and out of control.

05:22.516 --> 05:24.178
She wasn't that bad.

05:24.395 --> 05:26.684
It's the morphine.
That's what Dr. Sayers said.

05:26.899 --> 05:29.936
With her blood pressure,
I don't want to take any chances.

05:30.111 --> 05:31.226
Excuse me, Dr. Greene?

05:31.447 --> 05:32.776
I have Dr. Sayers for you.

05:34.619 --> 05:37.455
Dr. Sayers is a straight shooter.

05:38.123 --> 05:41.874
I respect the man. Your mother's
getting first-rate care.

05:42.088 --> 05:43.583
They owe her that.

05:48.389 --> 05:52.259
Don't you worry about this.
Mark is gonna get to the bottom of it.

05:55.191 --> 05:57.649
No, it doesn't look like artifact
to me.

06:00.115 --> 06:03.783
That's not good enough. I want
the MRl done tomorrow morning.

06:04.038 --> 06:06.163
What a nice, quiet neighborhood
you live in.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.496
Got beer in the house?

06:07.669 --> 06:10.671
Look. You may find a couple
in the garage.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.045
May I please use your bathroom?
My eyeballs are ready to float.

06:14.261 --> 06:15.507
Yes, ma'am. Through there.

06:15.681 --> 06:18.173
Nobody says that anymore.
"Yes, ma'am. " "No, ma'am. "

06:18.352 --> 06:20.927
It makes you feel better
just hearing it.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.023
Yes, ma'am, it does.

06:40.134 --> 06:43.220
Oh, I feel so much better.
Thanks for the shampoo.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.063
Is this too weird?

06:51.986 --> 06:56.366
No. Me in my old bed.
You in my mom's bathrobe.

06:57.077 --> 06:58.620
Not weird at all.

06:59.748 --> 07:01.029
I can take it off.

07:01.292 --> 07:02.834
That's all right.

07:03.503 --> 07:06.755
Do you think your dad minds
that I'm here? I think he likes me.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.923
Of course he likes you.
What's not to like?

07:10.848 --> 07:13.055
He's really beating himself up
over your mom.

07:13.769 --> 07:15.728
That'd be a first.

07:17.608 --> 07:21.524
I'm sorry. Just being here
brings out the adolescent in me.

07:23.034 --> 07:25.073
Flip over. I'll do your back.

07:35.092 --> 07:37.134
So this was your bed growing up?

07:37.346 --> 07:39.139
From age 8.

07:39.433 --> 07:43.183
We moved it from Jacksonville,
to Norfolk...

07:43.398 --> 07:45.475
...to Corpus Christi, to D.C.

07:47.028 --> 07:49.437
So that's why you curl up
when you sleep.

07:50.950 --> 07:53.360
Your feet are hanging over
the edge of the bed.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.991
All through high school.

07:57.668 --> 08:01.918
And during high school you would lie
in this very bed...

08:03.387 --> 08:05.676
And think about Kate Jackson.

08:05.848 --> 08:08.306
Kate Jackson? Not Farrah Fawcett?

08:08.518 --> 08:10.845
No. Farrah Fawcett's too scary.

08:12.024 --> 08:15.193
And Holly Fecteau.
The girl next door.

08:15.737 --> 08:17.531
Who would one night...

08:18.033 --> 08:20.241
...sneak into this room...

08:22.040 --> 08:24.247
...pick up the covers...

08:27.506 --> 08:30.046
...and slide into the bed,
next to you.

08:41.568 --> 08:42.732
What?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.070
Nothing.

08:51.334 --> 08:53.493
- We're late.
- I told you to give me a shout.

08:53.713 --> 08:55.921
You took so long to get
cleaned up.

08:56.133 --> 08:59.089
You don't just turn off a router
and walk away.

08:59.388 --> 09:00.551
- There he is.
- Who?

09:00.764 --> 09:02.224
Dr. Sayers.

09:02.602 --> 09:04.226
Dr. Sayers!

09:05.940 --> 09:07.565
You've caught me, sir.

09:07.775 --> 09:11.561
It's addiction when you're running
late and stop for your morning fix.

09:11.782 --> 09:12.945
This is my son, Mark.

09:13.159 --> 09:15.401
Nice to meet you.
You get a few hours sleep?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.116
A few.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.246
I'd like a triple grande,
non-fat cap. Gentlemen?

09:20.420 --> 09:22.129
- No, thanks.
- I'll take a tall latte.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.295
- Coming up.
- We're Navy, but we're still California.

09:25.470 --> 09:28.840
- And one of those almond buns too.
- Yes, sir. Coming up.

09:29.434 --> 09:30.809
I know you're concerned.

09:31.186 --> 09:32.896
Her history of high blood pressure-

09:33.106 --> 09:37.651
And she has an upgoing right toe.
It suggests stroke.

09:37.821 --> 09:42.035
CT didn't confirm that, and I didn't
detect hemiparesis or hyperreflexia.

09:42.244 --> 09:43.705
That's why I wanted the MRl.

09:43.914 --> 09:47.451
I was waiting to complete
a neuro exam before more tests.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.959
- Mark, if that's better-
- Dealer's choice.

09:50.298 --> 09:54.299
- My concern is giving your mom time-
- Time could be her worst enemy.

09:54.513 --> 09:55.794
It's why we moved it up.

09:55.974 --> 09:58.383
I'd like to be present
for the neuro exam.

09:58.603 --> 10:02.935
You're tapering her off the narcotics,
but, frankly, I'm-

10:06.072 --> 10:08.232
Present arms!

10:23.098 --> 10:25.851
Mrs. Greene, we're going to begin
the first sequence.

10:26.186 --> 10:27.218
Okay.

10:27.397 --> 10:29.604
This will take about
a half an hour, Mom.

10:29.817 --> 10:33.983
It's important that you don't move or
speak. Just take shallow, easy breaths.

10:34.198 --> 10:37.486
This first sequence will take
21/2 minutes to shoot.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.532
Beginning now.

10:40.542 --> 10:41.918
Where did my dad go?

10:42.169 --> 10:43.748
He said he'd be back after lunch.

10:43.963 --> 10:45.922
Went back to his garage.

10:46.133 --> 10:49.255
He's building a wheelchair ramp for
my mom when she comes home.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.926
It's all he's worried about.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.009
- It'll come in handy.
- Okay.

10:53.228 --> 10:55.850
Hang in there, Mrs. Greene.
You're doing well.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.056
No.

10:58.402 --> 11:00.775
- No.
- Just relax.

11:00.990 --> 11:04.028
- No!
- I'm here, Mom. I'm here.

11:04.787 --> 11:05.986
Mark?

11:06.205 --> 11:08.959
I can't stand it!
Mark, get me out!

11:09.169 --> 11:11.043
All right, stop it.
I'm getting her out.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.581
Oh, please! Oh, please!

11:13.800 --> 11:16.210
It's okay. I'm here, Mom.
I'm here.

11:17.222 --> 11:18.967
It's okay.

11:19.184 --> 11:21.308
- Don't move your leg.
- I can't stand it!

11:22.313 --> 11:24.023
What's the matter with me, Mark?!

11:24.233 --> 11:26.726
It's normal.
It's a normal reaction.

11:26.946 --> 11:29.652
I was all alone!
Yes. I was all alone!

11:29.866 --> 11:33.818
You're not alone now. I'm here.
I'm here for you, Mom.

11:34.498 --> 11:37.952
You're a good boy, Mark.
Stay with me, please?

11:38.171 --> 11:40.544
I'll stay. I'll stay. I'll stay.

11:40.758 --> 11:42.503
Just like always?

11:43.638 --> 11:45.466
Just like always.

11:47.309 --> 11:49.054
How's that ramp coming?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.230
Taking a break.

11:53.528 --> 11:55.319
What did the doctor say?

11:55.655 --> 11:58.064
Just presumptive diagnosis.

11:58.701 --> 12:00.696
Doctor's best guess.

12:01.873 --> 12:04.746
Her symptoms present like
a deep-tissue disease...

12:04.962 --> 12:07.002
...in the frontal lobe of the brain.

12:07.215 --> 12:11.464
MRI and second CT don't indicate
stroke or injury.

12:12.223 --> 12:14.300
Sayers is thinking...

12:14.518 --> 12:16.926
...multi-infarct dementia.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.137
What's that?

12:18.357 --> 12:22.024
Small infarcts, too small to detect...

12:22.238 --> 12:24.278
...in the brain tissue.

12:25.869 --> 12:28.824
It could manifest as disinhibition...

12:29.039 --> 12:33.206
...and it fits with her history of
hypertension.

12:36.301 --> 12:38.875
Can you explain that in English?

12:39.096 --> 12:40.925
What's an infarct?

12:42.101 --> 12:44.261
A series of very small strokes.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.930
- What can they do about it?
- Not much.

12:47.150 --> 12:49.725
Take a wait-and-see approach.

12:58.543 --> 13:01.117
- Do you still box?
- No.

13:02.842 --> 13:04.881
You always had the footwork for it.

13:06.305 --> 13:07.468
I hated the whole thing.

13:08.141 --> 13:09.801
You made that clear.

13:18.115 --> 13:21.984
What do you think about this
wait-and-see for your mother?

13:25.334 --> 13:28.477
I think the whole thing stinks.

13:37.218 --> 13:38.379
Dad?

13:40.805 --> 13:41.966
Dad?

13:46.936 --> 13:48.561
Greene residence.

13:48.772 --> 13:50.598
No, she's not.

13:51.107 --> 13:52.732
Hold on just a second.

13:53.359 --> 13:56.064
What was that? Stanley?
Stanley what?

13:56.280 --> 13:58.318
What's this regarding?

14:00.365 --> 14:02.905
Well, she may know,
but this is her son...

14:03.119 --> 14:06.619
...and she'll be tied up this week.
I don't think she's gonna keep...

14:06.790 --> 14:09.281
...her appointment, whatever it's for.

14:10.878 --> 14:12.787
Right. Okay.

14:12.963 --> 14:14.457
I'll pass it along.

14:14.674 --> 14:18.624
It's like a foreign language.
You have to grow up in it.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.427
Hey, good morning!

14:20.637 --> 14:23.128
- My luggage didn't come, did it?
- Nope.

14:23.307 --> 14:26.144
- Dad, do you know a Stanley Black?
- No.

14:26.352 --> 14:29.354
- Where does Mom go every Thursday?
- What do you mean?

14:29.564 --> 14:33.892
On her calendar, 2:00 is marked on
Thursday for the last few months.

14:34.110 --> 14:37.112
Could be her women's group at
the Family Services Pavilion.

14:37.321 --> 14:38.865
Which group is that?

14:39.074 --> 14:41.991
Spouses of retired officers.
Wives get together.

14:42.202 --> 14:44.823
Is that for bridge,
service projects, or what?

14:45.039 --> 14:47.446
It's your mother's group.
I have no idea.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.326
Who wants breakfast?
I'll make eggs.

14:49.543 --> 14:51.786
You already got one burning.

14:52.337 --> 14:56.287
You take that one, instead of
sneaking mine when I'm not around.

14:56.509 --> 14:58.336
You counting cigarettes now?

14:59.096 --> 15:01.467
I'll pass on breakfast, thanks.

15:06.019 --> 15:07.811
I didn't start that.

15:08.271 --> 15:10.264
He was in a good mood before.

15:13.235 --> 15:17.150
What were those three items that
I asked you to remember earlier?

15:18.990 --> 15:20.021
There were three.

15:20.242 --> 15:23.990
Yes. One was a phone book.

15:28.292 --> 15:30.165
- Were they important?
- Not really.

15:30.377 --> 15:33.663
But do you remember?
A phone book...

15:33.881 --> 15:36.254
...an apple and...?

15:38.052 --> 15:39.428
Banana?

15:43.809 --> 15:44.887
No?

15:46.645 --> 15:49.515
- Do I lose points for guessing?
- Not at all.

15:50.024 --> 15:51.517
Let's move on.

15:51.900 --> 15:56.146
I'm going to tell you a saying. It's
something that you've heard before.

15:56.363 --> 16:00.195
- I want you to tell me what it means.
- Okay.

16:01.118 --> 16:03.870
"People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw bricks. "

16:04.080 --> 16:05.278
Have you heard that one?

16:05.497 --> 16:08.071
Yes, I have. I've heard it.

16:08.292 --> 16:09.752
And what does it mean?

16:12.672 --> 16:13.834
I should get this.

16:14.048 --> 16:17.748
We've lived in lots of different
houses, haven't we, Mark?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.214
Never a glass house.

16:20.514 --> 16:23.301
"People in glass houses
shouldn't throw bricks. "

16:23.517 --> 16:26.008
Well, people shouldn't throw bricks.

16:26.227 --> 16:28.850
Even if it's close quarters,
and it usually is.

16:29.063 --> 16:31.390
You've got to get along with
the other families.

16:31.608 --> 16:33.731
They're all in the same boat you are.

16:34.737 --> 16:37.940
The children are probably
the ones throwing the bricks.

16:39.158 --> 16:42.823
And how do the mothers stop them
if the fathers aren't around?

16:43.037 --> 16:45.160
It's always the mother's fault.

16:45.373 --> 16:48.706
Even if she doesn't wanna have
the children in the first place.

16:54.674 --> 16:56.548
That was a trick question.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.128
But I think I've got it, sneaky.

17:02.431 --> 17:04.758
If you live in a glass house...

17:05.644 --> 17:07.801
...there are no bricks to throw.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.853
Right? Right?

17:18.199 --> 17:20.440
- Dr. Greene?
- Yes.

17:20.660 --> 17:24.075
Okay. I've got Corey-Bloom...

17:24.289 --> 17:26.695
...Acta Neurologica Scandinavia...

17:26.916 --> 17:30.701
...McLaughlin, Sandison and Flostein.

17:30.921 --> 17:31.951
Thank you.

17:32.129 --> 17:34.835
I'm off at 12, but you're
welcome to stay if you need to.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.426
I will.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.012
Hey.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.691
I thought you were asleep.

17:51.859 --> 17:53.519
I woke up.

17:56.072 --> 18:00.320
- Sorry I got ahead of you.
- Don't you dare apologize.

18:00.536 --> 18:02.112
I thought you were with me.

18:02.329 --> 18:06.540
You are the most considerate man
that I've ever been with.

18:07.334 --> 18:09.872
Every single time doesn't have
to be about me.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.539
Still, I...

18:12.589 --> 18:14.665
I don't know where you get it.

18:14.883 --> 18:17.374
You know, being so generous?

18:17.887 --> 18:21.671
If I had whatever it is
that your mom has...

18:21.891 --> 18:26.054
...and if I just said everything
that was on my mind...

18:26.354 --> 18:30.481
...I would thank both of your parents for
raising a son who's such a good lover.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.651
You bring it out in me.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.485
You lie.
It has nothing to do with me.

18:38.115 --> 18:39.658
You take care of people.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.690
Yeah.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.496
That's me, the caretaker.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.119
It's not a bad thing.

18:47.335 --> 18:52.246
I'm like a magnet for needy people.
It's like they find me wherever I go.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.796
Like I did?

18:56.552 --> 18:57.750
No.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.174
Yeah, Mark. I lean on you.
I mean, it must be a drag.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.427
No.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.434
It's just all this stuff with my mom.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.523
Yeah. You're just overwhelmed
right now.

19:17.740 --> 19:21.276
Very still, Mom. Very still.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.362
What's this one for?

19:24.582 --> 19:26.408
We want to rule out encephalitis.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.868
It may be why you're not feeling
like yourself.

19:29.045 --> 19:31.036
Isn't that why they scanned my belly?

19:31.255 --> 19:33.876
That was to rule out Paraneoplastic
Syndrome.

19:34.050 --> 19:35.379
Almost done.

19:35.593 --> 19:37.882
How many more rule-outs are left?

19:38.095 --> 19:39.127
Are you getting tired?

19:39.347 --> 19:41.173
The other doctor said I could go home.

19:41.390 --> 19:45.174
He signed off on the knee. They still
have to do an EEG tomorrow.

19:45.395 --> 19:46.557
It doesn't have to be done.

19:46.772 --> 19:49.856
If it's Jakob-Creutzfeldt,
I don't wanna mess around.

19:50.066 --> 19:52.058
How about a brain biopsy
while we're at it?

19:52.235 --> 19:56.233
I know I'm pushing you for a more
aggressive approach than you're used to.

19:56.447 --> 19:59.448
I can be thorough without
being aggressive.

20:01.328 --> 20:02.408
All done, Mrs. Greene.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.988
- Can I go now?
- Probably in another day or two.

20:09.127 --> 20:12.544
If my mother were in the ER, I'd
be terrible support for her.

20:12.756 --> 20:14.713
I don't have the temperament for ER.

20:14.926 --> 20:17.713
I don't have the temperament
for passive treatment.

20:17.928 --> 20:20.337
Is your mother sick too, doctor?

20:20.724 --> 20:22.182
No, my mother's fine.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.764
Your indulging me in a few tests
is not enough.

20:24.978 --> 20:27.895
I want a second opinion.

20:28.106 --> 20:29.897
I'll ask the head of Neurology.

20:30.734 --> 20:32.726
No. I'll find a civilian.

20:42.496 --> 20:45.414
- She's been seeing this shrink.
- What for?

20:45.624 --> 20:47.996
The guy wouldn't tell me
without a release.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.584
I'm gonna meet with him
at the hospital tomorrow.

20:51.882 --> 20:54.751
Sorry, son.
Are you a retired naval officer?

20:54.967 --> 20:57.007
No, my father is.
We're meeting him here.

20:57.303 --> 20:59.462
I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you to leave.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.254
- Give me a break.
- It's club night.

21:02.475 --> 21:04.599
You need to be with a retired officer.

21:04.811 --> 21:06.389
He's on his way. He's late.

21:06.605 --> 21:08.265
You'll have to wait for him.

21:08.482 --> 21:11.103
You're wrong, pal. We're seated.

21:11.986 --> 21:13.729
We'll have a draft and a margarita.

21:13.946 --> 21:15.227
You got it.

21:16.616 --> 21:19.402
- What are you buying me?
- I beg your pardon?

21:19.619 --> 21:21.362
You're as stubborn as your old man.

21:21.579 --> 21:24.330
Don't tell me you're
as cheap as he is too?

21:25.124 --> 21:27.331
Admiral J. Jackson, retired.

21:28.711 --> 21:33.539
You better be Dave Greene's son or I
just got myself into a hornet's nest.

21:33.758 --> 21:36.629
That's right. Mark Greene.
This is Cynthia Hooper.

21:36.886 --> 21:37.918
How do you do?

21:38.137 --> 21:40.047
Your dad just called to say
he'd be late.

21:40.264 --> 21:41.808
So, what are you drinking?

21:42.017 --> 21:45.303
Not a drop more.
I'm late for dinner as it is.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.513
Pleased to see you again, though.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.476
We met your senior year.
You were considering Annapolis.

21:51.693 --> 21:53.817
My dad was considering Annapolis.

21:54.029 --> 21:57.530
Well, you can't blame your old man
for trying.

21:57.699 --> 22:00.026
Turn down a flag billet
for your family...

22:00.746 --> 22:02.619
...you want your son to
make the grade.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.871
- What's a flag billet?
- Admiral.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.912
His dad was in line.
Middle of his command tour.

22:08.128 --> 22:10.037
He took himself out of the running.

22:10.255 --> 22:12.047
Why? Didn't he wanna be admiral?

22:12.215 --> 22:13.709
Long story.

22:13.925 --> 22:16.926
- Put their drinks on my tab.
- You're sure you don't wanna stay?

22:17.137 --> 22:18.929
Admiral J., nice to see you, sir.

22:19.140 --> 22:20.883
Sorry I have to run.

22:21.058 --> 22:24.723
I could relive the Korean conflict
for you young folks.

22:25.646 --> 22:26.678
How's Ruth?

22:26.898 --> 22:28.688
- She'll be home tomorrow.
- She will?

22:29.233 --> 22:31.522
That's what I said.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.654
Lucy and I'll drop by
when she's feeling better.

22:34.864 --> 22:37.105
- Nice seeing you, meeting you.
- Same here.

22:38.993 --> 22:41.034
- What can I get you, Dad?
- Not a thing.

22:41.746 --> 22:44.320
- Something wrong?
- Why'd you say Mom's coming home?

22:44.540 --> 22:45.784
She's had her last test.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.867
- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has, Mark. Syphilis?

22:50.088 --> 22:52.758
- What?
- You tested your mother for syphilis?

22:52.925 --> 22:54.667
- Are the results back?
- No.

22:54.843 --> 22:58.591
No. I stopped the whole damn thing.
Whatever gave you the idea?

22:58.764 --> 23:00.554
I need an explanation.

23:00.766 --> 23:02.759
What the hell do you think
of your mother?

23:02.935 --> 23:04.263
The symptoms fit.

23:04.437 --> 23:06.096
What the hell do you think of me?

23:06.272 --> 23:08.941
Settle down, Dad.
Why don't you use your inhaler?

23:09.109 --> 23:12.442
- Is your oxygen in the car?
- Some damn nerve.

23:12.945 --> 23:15.733
If the test is so unthinkable,
what's your fear?

23:15.948 --> 23:18.024
- You're accusing me?
- No!

23:18.201 --> 23:19.826
He didn't mean it like that.

23:20.035 --> 23:23.868
- I need a diagnosis.
- You need someone to blame, like always.

23:24.082 --> 23:25.542
Take it easy, Dad.

23:25.793 --> 23:27.203
Don't you patronize me.

23:27.419 --> 23:29.128
There's no need for you to meddle.

23:29.296 --> 23:30.459
Should I get your oxygen?

23:30.671 --> 23:33.045
- Insults your mother.
- Okay, great.

23:33.258 --> 23:36.462
Go back to Chicago and
leave us alone. I mean...

23:36.679 --> 23:37.958
...she's going home!

23:38.138 --> 23:41.305
Good. I'll tell that psychiatrist
she's been secretly seeing...

23:41.474 --> 23:42.970
...not to come to the hospital.

23:43.144 --> 23:44.768
What the hell are you talking-?

23:44.979 --> 23:48.314
She's going to a shrink,
not a sewing circle every Thursday.

23:48.483 --> 23:50.356
- Why would she do that?
- Mark, come on.

23:50.569 --> 23:53.604
Or is that me meddling?
Making too much trouble?

23:53.822 --> 23:56.657
When her life with you is
so picture-perfect!

23:59.328 --> 24:02.328
All right, Dad. Take a breath.
Take a breath.

24:02.540 --> 24:03.915
Where's your albuterol?

24:04.124 --> 24:05.999
- Shall I get the oxygen?
- Yes, go!

24:06.167 --> 24:09.335
- He's not breathing.
- Get him on the ground. Call 911 for him.

24:09.504 --> 24:12.416
All right. Let him down easy.

24:28.343 --> 24:32.847
Your dad's peak flow improved to 250.
Has a pH of 7.38 on 10 liters.

24:33.064 --> 24:36.652
His PO2's 65. His PCO2's down to 48.

24:36.824 --> 24:38.819
It won't get better.
He's a heavy smoker.

24:38.996 --> 24:42.702
Yeah. We've got him on
125 Solu-Medrol IV.

24:42.923 --> 24:44.717
Captain Greene, do you feel better?

24:45.471 --> 24:47.134
I feel fine.

24:47.309 --> 24:50.898
I know you've been under stress
with your wife admitted upstairs.

24:51.112 --> 24:52.228
That's right.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.325
That may have brought on the attack.

24:54.537 --> 24:57.662
We'll keep an eye on you here
in the ER for a few hours.

24:57.879 --> 25:00.124
- Why don't you come back later?
- Thanks.

25:03.353 --> 25:05.062
Kind of gave us a scare.

25:06.819 --> 25:08.065
Is Cindy with your mom?

25:08.532 --> 25:10.992
Drove her home.
She was asleep on her feet.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.624
You're not going to bother
your mother with this?

25:15.843 --> 25:17.673
No. She doesn't need to know.

25:23.613 --> 25:25.656
I'm sorry if I upset you.

25:27.206 --> 25:30.081
- About that test for your mom?
- It's canceled.

25:30.632 --> 25:33.388
No. Draw the blood.

25:33.597 --> 25:35.724
You need to know.

25:38.444 --> 25:40.855
I was treating her depression
with Paxil.

25:41.075 --> 25:43.618
She failed to mention her hypertension.

25:43.791 --> 25:44.990
I should let you know...

25:45.211 --> 25:49.132
...I'm getting a neurological
consult from a colleague at UCSD.

25:49.305 --> 25:52.894
Dr. Hemmings. She was with her
when I arrived this morning.

25:53.107 --> 25:55.947
But I told her I agree with
Dr. Sayers' diagnosis.

25:56.157 --> 25:59.911
Multi-infarcts dementia in
co-morbidity with her depression.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.502
I know it's not the diagnosis
you're hoping for.

26:02.716 --> 26:06.471
It's not about what I hope for,
it's about my mother's care.

26:07.938 --> 26:11.693
I'm sure you've heard about how
stubborn the men are in my family.

26:11.906 --> 26:13.452
I know it's confidential.

26:13.662 --> 26:18.331
Your mother signed a release. You can
know about her psychiatric treatment.

26:18.548 --> 26:21.045
If I wanna know about my mom,
I'll ask her.

26:21.223 --> 26:25.643
Be sure you want the answers. In her
current state, she's liable to tell you.

26:37.933 --> 26:39.050
Mark.

26:39.437 --> 26:40.470
Mark!

26:41.819 --> 26:43.446
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

26:43.657 --> 26:45.819
You were gone for a long time.

26:46.331 --> 26:48.290
- I guess I needed it.
- Yeah.

26:48.837 --> 26:51.961
Dr. Hemmings called. She wants to
push up your meeting to 3:00.

26:52.137 --> 26:53.932
It's the neurologist I called in.

26:54.143 --> 26:57.351
- She's an old friend?
- Yeah. Went to med school.

26:57.568 --> 27:00.110
She wanted to know if I'd
be coming along.

27:00.325 --> 27:03.165
I figured you'd want to
talk about your mom privately.

27:03.374 --> 27:05.288
Yeah. It's about her condition.

27:19.459 --> 27:22.085
Hey, take turns or you'll
both get a time-out.

27:22.299 --> 27:24.260
Thank you, Josh.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.925
They say girls are more mellow.
Please confirm that.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.268
Don't ask me.

27:28.482 --> 27:31.822
- You have Rachel.
- Not full-time.

27:32.242 --> 27:35.997
I remember when Rachel was born.
We were third-year.

27:36.210 --> 27:38.172
I was so envious of you and Jen.

27:38.384 --> 27:41.425
You? You were the most
driven student in class.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.810
Yeah, but you were the most together.

27:44.023 --> 27:46.945
You knew you wanted a family
and you went for it.

27:47.156 --> 27:48.868
And now you've lapped me.

27:49.078 --> 27:50.360
Twice.

27:50.582 --> 27:53.542
If I knew you were on maternity
leave, I wouldn't have called.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.552
It was my pleasure.

27:56.264 --> 27:59.139
I was a little taken aback
when I found out...

27:59.313 --> 28:01.987
...that your mom's a patient of
Andrew Sayers.

28:02.280 --> 28:06.070
He's hot stuff.
Gaining a national reputation.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.580
I haven't been that wowed.

28:09.214 --> 28:11.257
I'm really surprised at you, Mark.

28:11.471 --> 28:14.511
Josh, no. Please.
We don't throw sand.

28:15.230 --> 28:18.356
I thought the ER would be
a brief detour.

28:18.572 --> 28:21.662
I thought for sure you'd end up
in family practice.

28:21.872 --> 28:23.286
Really? I was that boring?

28:23.503 --> 28:25.164
You know I didn't think that.

28:25.549 --> 28:27.260
We were 25.

28:27.470 --> 28:30.145
I was busy showing how
independent I was...

28:30.354 --> 28:32.515
...and you were going to be
the family man.

28:32.734 --> 28:35.526
Now here I am, and you're a cowboy.

28:36.495 --> 28:39.703
I still haven't given up on
the idea of having a family.

28:40.422 --> 28:42.548
Yeah. Cynthia sounded sweet.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.604
Still know how to cut to the quick,
don't you?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.942
You wanna hear about your mom?

28:50.155 --> 28:51.237
Do I?

28:52.035 --> 28:55.742
Your mom may not fully return
to the way she was.

28:55.963 --> 28:57.923
That's gonna take some
getting used to.

29:23.074 --> 29:24.108
How's she doing?

29:24.328 --> 29:26.491
She was asleep when I arrived.

29:26.709 --> 29:27.910
I owe you an apology.

29:28.213 --> 29:29.461
No. It's your mother.

29:29.676 --> 29:31.053
But still, I...

29:31.932 --> 29:34.688
- It wasn't personal.
- You don't have to explain.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.063
My dad was in the Navy too.

29:37.238 --> 29:38.899
Chip on my shoulder's easy to read?

29:39.117 --> 29:41.576
Plain as rank.
Strong, hard-working father-

29:41.790 --> 29:43.204
Never there.

29:44.047 --> 29:46.542
But you followed
in your dad's footsteps?

29:48.266 --> 29:50.595
I wish I could tell you
it got me closer.

29:55.744 --> 29:57.656
- Give me a hand!
- What's going on?

29:57.874 --> 30:00.369
We gotta move your dad.
I got a mass cal coming in.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.759
They had a chopper crash.
A CH-46.

30:02.972 --> 30:04.088
Holds a platoon?

30:04.308 --> 30:06.637
Just had her crew aboard
and one injured.

30:06.815 --> 30:07.847
- How many?
- Three!

30:08.026 --> 30:10.320
- Evac's landed.
- Let's move!

30:14.335 --> 30:16.164
Ready, one, two, three!

30:19.347 --> 30:21.974
Ready? One, two, three.

30:22.189 --> 30:26.062
She's got an eviscerating abdominal
wound. Get O-neg on the infuser.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.618
BP is 40.
Pulse is weak and thready.

30:33.218 --> 30:35.713
Ready? One, two, three.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.225
- How bad are they?
- Pretty bad.

30:40.612 --> 30:41.693
Fib!

30:41.865 --> 30:45.453
They're gonna defibrillate.
They're gonna shock her.

30:49.969 --> 30:52.048
I tried to pull up,
but the stick got heavy.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.432
Fractured ankle.

30:54.315 --> 30:56.988
The stick, it wouldn't budge.

30:57.197 --> 30:59.573
- We were 30 feet off the deck.
- Don't worry, son.

30:59.787 --> 31:02.628
- Are the others okay?
- They're doing everything they can.

31:02.837 --> 31:05.166
We pitched forward.
I couldn't pull back.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.929
I couldn't budge the stick!

31:07.140 --> 31:09.136
Just thank God you weren't full.

31:09.313 --> 31:10.643
I gotta help my crew!

31:10.815 --> 31:12.479
Settle down, son.
You did your best.

31:12.655 --> 31:15.114
- Couldn't pull the stick.
- Sounds mechanical.

31:15.328 --> 31:19.333
You got the best doctors and
nurses and corpsmen in the world...

31:19.547 --> 31:21.092
...working on your crew.

31:21.303 --> 31:24.343
Stop blaming yourself
and let them do their work.

31:26.482 --> 31:28.277
Can you hear me, son?

31:30.535 --> 31:33.112
Hey, buddy.
This guy's not breathing.

31:33.334 --> 31:36.091
- He was just talking.
- No carotid pulse. Bag him.

31:36.466 --> 31:37.583
He's crashing!

31:37.803 --> 31:39.181
Corpsman, take over here!

31:39.893 --> 31:41.270
It's a tension pneumo.

31:41.898 --> 31:43.809
You're right. 14 gauge.

31:44.112 --> 31:46.607
Notify the surgical
and critical care unit.

31:49.919 --> 31:51.380
Is he okay?

31:55.349 --> 31:56.466
Good call.

31:56.687 --> 32:00.108
- Need some help?
- Yeah, I'm prepping for an escharotomy.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.608
- Ever done a chest tube?
- I've seen two.

32:02.828 --> 32:04.490
Do you have staff privileges?

32:04.708 --> 32:06.085
I'm not licensed here.

32:06.295 --> 32:08.970
- Can you show her?
- No problem. Chest tube tray.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.381
What Dr. Greene says,
consider it an order.

32:11.601 --> 32:12.634
Yes, sir.

32:12.855 --> 32:16.229
Get the gloves on. I'll assist.
You'll need a 36 French.

32:16.447 --> 32:18.074
Is he okay?

32:18.493 --> 32:21.036
Should be. How about you?

32:27.309 --> 32:31.729
Fifth intercostal space.
Mid-axillary line.

32:33.116 --> 32:35.277
20 cc's of xylocaine.

32:36.248 --> 32:37.746
That's right.

32:43.214 --> 32:44.708
Home sweet home!

32:44.924 --> 32:47.298
You guys were so fast.
Dinner isn't even ready!

32:48.178 --> 32:50.968
Look at the azaleas!
They never looked so good.

32:51.185 --> 32:53.891
I picked off all the dead ones,
like you like them.

32:54.855 --> 32:57.526
It is so good to be back,
I'm telling you.

32:57.735 --> 32:59.443
- Welcome home!
- Thank you!

33:00.657 --> 33:02.235
No wonder you took a spill.

33:02.408 --> 33:06.455
I had to start cleaning things up.
I don't know what's there.

33:06.665 --> 33:09.583
- Look. Was this yours?
- Mr. Funny Bear.

33:09.753 --> 33:11.462
You loved the fur off this thing.

33:11.714 --> 33:13.209
What is this?

33:13.426 --> 33:14.455
Not that fiasco.

33:14.676 --> 33:18.676
You remember? You saw it in the PX,
and you begged and begged me for it.

33:18.890 --> 33:20.930
We hung it from the ceiling
in his bedroom.

33:21.102 --> 33:24.390
It was Dave's first tour of Viet-
Was it his first tour?

33:24.607 --> 33:25.806
- Don't remember.
- Must've been.

33:26.026 --> 33:29.610
Your father put you in the cockpit
before he left.

33:29.782 --> 33:32.155
You looked at this thing every night.

33:32.368 --> 33:34.908
Till he got home
and laughed his head off.

33:35.248 --> 33:37.574
We got the wrong damn plane.

33:37.793 --> 33:41.246
That's a Phantom. Dad flew A-6's.
"What's that doing in your room? "

33:41.424 --> 33:43.501
- He wasn't angry with you.
- He tore it down.

33:43.718 --> 33:46.840
No, you tore it down, remember?
You got a spanking.

33:47.056 --> 33:49.181
The one he replaced,
I tore that down.

33:49.394 --> 33:52.266
Somebody tore something down.
Anyway, I'm hungry!

33:53.525 --> 33:57.145
I'm really sorry about dinner.
I wasn't used to your oven.

33:57.322 --> 33:58.401
Let me make you-

33:58.573 --> 34:00.568
Every woman's not cut out
for the kitchen.

34:00.785 --> 34:03.907
My generation, we had to be
natural-born wives and mothers.

34:04.123 --> 34:05.867
That doesn't sound so bad.

34:06.042 --> 34:07.074
I think he's back.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.536
Sex isn't enough to hold
a family together.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.166
Dave and I got the sex part right.

34:13.429 --> 34:16.051
Can't count on that,
if you are counting on it.

34:16.266 --> 34:18.426
We're not counting on anything.

34:18.643 --> 34:20.554
- We're not?
- See? She's counting on it.

34:20.772 --> 34:22.315
- What are we talking about?
- Sex.

34:22.483 --> 34:26.186
- Whether sex means more than sex.
- Leave me out of that conversation.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.859
Why don't you want to talk?

34:28.032 --> 34:31.699
- I know why. You don't have to say.
- I hope pizza's okay.

34:31.913 --> 34:33.871
I'm not hungry.

34:38.005 --> 34:39.880
I am so sorry.

34:40.342 --> 34:45.054
You are a wonderful, beautiful person.

34:45.224 --> 34:47.467
But you don't love me.

34:48.146 --> 34:49.179
I don't know.

34:49.397 --> 34:51.306
Then you don't.

34:51.525 --> 34:54.896
I was an idiot to come out here
like I was part of your family.

34:55.114 --> 34:56.739
No, no, no. It's my fault.

34:58.745 --> 35:00.904
I should've told you.

35:01.372 --> 35:03.331
I was just being selfish.

35:08.801 --> 35:10.594
You mean a lot to me.

35:14.518 --> 35:16.890
I never intended to lead you on.

35:19.192 --> 35:21.862
I thought we were both
enjoying ourselves-

35:22.070 --> 35:24.278
Stop. Please.

35:25.117 --> 35:28.118
This may be new for you,
but I've heard it before.

35:28.329 --> 35:29.789
Too many times.

35:29.958 --> 35:32.793
So I guess I ask for it.

35:34.463 --> 35:38.415
I never should've let it
go on so long.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.673
You know, we should go.
I don't want to miss my plane.

35:41.891 --> 35:45.261
- You really don't need to leave.
- Yeah, I really do.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.149
I'll be back in Chicago in a week.
We'll talk more.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.188
We don't have to talk.

35:51.405 --> 35:54.193
You know, there's a lot
that's good about us together.

35:54.409 --> 35:57.696
I mean, I feel that way.
I hope you do too.

35:57.914 --> 36:00.405
At least I got to see the Pacific.

36:08.221 --> 36:09.336
Ready, Mom?

36:09.515 --> 36:11.472
Yep, I'm ready.

36:15.356 --> 36:16.852
Put your arm around my neck.

36:17.025 --> 36:19.066
Lean on me. Good.
No weight on that leg.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.688
I don't know why I can't
use the walker.

36:22.450 --> 36:26.913
Wait until the therapist gives you
your lesson. Okay?

36:27.416 --> 36:30.453
Don't empty that.
I might need to use it again.

36:30.670 --> 36:33.210
The nurse isn't gonna be here
for an hour.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.252
You've gotta let Dad and I help.

36:35.469 --> 36:37.711
I do. I am.

36:39.141 --> 36:41.051
It's time for your pills.

36:41.727 --> 36:43.389
I'm tired of pills.

36:43.731 --> 36:46.057
Just take the pills, Mom.

36:46.443 --> 36:48.602
I can't get Dad to pay attention.

36:48.822 --> 36:49.902
He pays attention.

36:50.115 --> 36:52.323
Yeah. In the garage.

36:52.535 --> 36:54.493
Don't be like that.

36:56.249 --> 37:00.415
Is it true that Dad had a shot
at making admiral?

37:01.800 --> 37:04.504
Yes, of course he did.
You know that story.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.097
Remind me.

37:06.556 --> 37:11.102
It was that Leadbetter boy.
He was such a bully to you.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.647
Tommy Leadbetter?

37:12.857 --> 37:15.265
He used to beat me up every day
in sixth grade.

37:15.444 --> 37:16.689
You were scared of school.

37:16.905 --> 37:18.280
I don't remember that part.

37:19.701 --> 37:21.942
I made your father come back.

37:22.162 --> 37:23.443
Of course-

37:25.291 --> 37:28.911
I didn't tell him he had to, but I
knew if I wrote enough, he'd come.

37:29.131 --> 37:31.837
That's when he took
that desk job in Hueneme?

37:37.184 --> 37:40.186
And, you know,
he never once complained.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.156
Dr. Black says...

37:47.324 --> 37:51.109
...you and your father are
responsible for your own feelings.

37:54.710 --> 37:58.046
But I know I started it.

38:01.261 --> 38:05.807
I blamed him. I blamed you.

38:07.645 --> 38:09.971
I didn't want a baby.

38:10.691 --> 38:12.733
It was too soon.

38:12.944 --> 38:15.615
We'd only dated a couple of times.

38:18.745 --> 38:22.530
Of course, when I saw you,
I loved you.

38:23.293 --> 38:26.331
And I tried to make up for it.

38:28.801 --> 38:33.180
But I'd already spoiled everything
between you and your father.

38:33.392 --> 38:35.764
And it just kept going wrong...

38:37.146 --> 38:41.146
...no matter how much
I loved you both.

38:53.921 --> 38:55.631
David!

38:57.594 --> 38:59.253
David!

39:01.266 --> 39:02.760
- What's going on?
- I don't know!

39:02.934 --> 39:05.223
She's not in bed.

39:06.272 --> 39:07.815
David!

39:08.025 --> 39:09.733
- Help me! Help me!
- Help your mom.

39:09.944 --> 39:12.484
Hurry up! Hurry up!

39:12.698 --> 39:14.989
Oh, God! Hurry!

39:15.536 --> 39:17.908
Dad, get the wheelchair.
Mom, what happened?

39:18.123 --> 39:20.366
I just thought a little broth
would be nice.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.828
We'll get you up slowly.
Be careful.

39:23.047 --> 39:24.541
Dad, give me a hand.

39:24.799 --> 39:27.505
On a count. One, two, three.

39:29.222 --> 39:30.801
Easy, easy. All right.

39:31.308 --> 39:32.554
Is your leg okay?

39:32.769 --> 39:36.140
Oh, gosh! What if I broke it?

39:37.151 --> 39:38.978
Slide back. There you go.

39:39.613 --> 39:42.864
That's why you can't use that walker.
Because this can happen.

39:43.534 --> 39:46.454
Oh, dear. I forgot to go
to the bathroom.

39:46.664 --> 39:48.290
I'll clean up. You go ahead.

40:49.422 --> 40:52.259
We have a non-injury accident
in the right-hand lane.

40:52.428 --> 40:55.347
Traffic is extremely slow
on the Bay Bridge today...

40:55.556 --> 40:58.429
...with the U.S.S. Long Beach
home-ported at North Island.

40:59.480 --> 41:03.016
- Is that gonna hold us up?
- We' re not going on the Bay Bridge.

41:03.235 --> 41:05.312
I heard you say we
won't be back for lunch.

41:05.531 --> 41:08.365
That's right. No more clues.

41:15.627 --> 41:17.668
You used to bring me down here.

41:17.881 --> 41:19.839
There used to be something to see.

41:21.970 --> 41:25.092
Every one of those docks
used to be full.

41:26.018 --> 41:28.261
- Dad?
- No, thanks. I've stopped.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.808
You what?

41:29.982 --> 41:31.810
I gave them up for your mother.

41:32.027 --> 41:34.946
- Since when?
- Since the hospital.

41:35.657 --> 41:38.196
Have you seen me take a cigarette?

41:38.410 --> 41:41.449
You smoked two packs a day
for 50 years.

41:41.832 --> 41:45.037
You must be going through some
heavy-duty withdrawals.

41:48.050 --> 41:50.673
We saw the Kitty Hawk here, remember?

41:51.430 --> 41:53.637
Yeah. It scared me.

41:53.850 --> 41:55.594
It's huge.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.347
I remember that flight deck.
It was like...

41:58.524 --> 42:00.731
...standing at the edge of the earth.

42:00.944 --> 42:03.697
Most hazardous work site there is.

42:04.866 --> 42:07.156
What was it like working on a carrier?

42:08.038 --> 42:09.236
Hard.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.838
How many aircraft would you
launch in a day?

42:14.045 --> 42:18.509
Up to 140 in a 12-hour shift.

42:19.219 --> 42:22.176
Launchings, 20 seconds apart.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.051
Landings, every 40 seconds.

42:25.688 --> 42:28.228
We worked all kind of weather...

42:28.443 --> 42:30.187
...day and night.

42:30.653 --> 42:32.481
Sounds intense.

42:32.698 --> 42:34.443
Best time was
in the morning...

42:35.578 --> 42:37.905
...before they started the engines.

42:38.707 --> 42:42.078
I'd come up on the bridge...

42:42.671 --> 42:46.670
...and watch the sun rise over
the flight deck and the canopies.

42:47.511 --> 42:50.717
Ocean rolling as far as you could see.

42:51.016 --> 42:52.891
Admiral wasn't up yet...

42:53.104 --> 42:56.308
...complaining of the jet fuel
in his water.

42:57.443 --> 42:59.104
Deck crew would be out working...

43:00.573 --> 43:03.777
...on the catapults
and the arresting gear.

43:03.953 --> 43:05.696
Ordinance guys loading up.

43:07.834 --> 43:09.577
You knew in a minute...

43:10.337 --> 43:12.377
...the engines would start...

43:12.591 --> 43:14.963
...and lives would be at stake...

43:15.177 --> 43:18.630
...for every minute
of the next 12 hours.

43:22.145 --> 43:23.262
Sound familiar?

43:24.482 --> 43:25.764
Sort of.

43:29.030 --> 43:30.858
I'm proud of what you do, son.

43:32.828 --> 43:34.204
I'm proud of you.

43:38.545 --> 43:40.788
Thanks for helping me get there.

43:47.933 --> 43:50.223
Your mother's gonna be worried.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
