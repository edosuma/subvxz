Balki!

01:26.687 --> 01:31.357
You are looking at
the luckiest man in Chicago!

01:31.391 --> 01:33.159
‐Well, I hope you’re happy.
‐I am.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.761
Because you are about to eat

01:34.795 --> 01:37.598
the driest pig pancreas souffle
known to man.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.306
You could have called.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.878
You’re right.
I am wrong. I am sorry.

01:51.912 --> 01:55.215
Alright.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.350
I happen to have two courtside
seats to tonight’s Bulls game.

01:57.383 --> 01:58.451
Wait a minute, cousin‐‐

01:58.484 --> 02:00.587
It’s the biggest
basketball game of the season.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.655
You’re not gonna
believe what happened.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.656
Wainwright called me

02:02.689 --> 02:04.558
told me
he can’t make tonight’s game.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.192
Since he knows
I’m a big Bulls fan

02:06.226 --> 02:07.928
he’s having
the tickets sent here.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.630
Is life good or what?

02:11.464 --> 02:13.534
Can I wedge in a wise word here?

02:15.401 --> 02:18.204
You promised Jennifer you would
take her to the ballet tonight.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.840
Oh, I took care of that.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.407
I told her I had to do
something for Mr. Wainwright.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.176
She understood perfectly.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.378
So you lied.

02:25.411 --> 02:27.881
‐No, I didn’t.
‐You always lie.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.850
I am doing something
for Mr. Wainwright.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.918
I’m using his tickets
at his request.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.387
So you lied.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.189
‐No, I didn’t.
‐Yes, you did.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.624
‐No, I didn’t.
‐Yes, you sure did.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.394
At worst,
I am massaging the truth a bit.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.463
Massaging it?

02:43.496 --> 02:46.833
You gave it a full body
loofah scrub and a mud bath!

02:48.935 --> 02:50.971
Balki, you and I are going
to the game tonight

02:51.004 --> 02:52.706
and we are gonna
have a great time!

02:52.739 --> 02:54.808
Oh, is that so, is that?

02:54.841 --> 02:57.778
Well, let me tell you
it has been my observation

02:57.811 --> 03:00.647
that every time you lie to
Jennifer something bad happens.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.583
I saw the exact
same thing happen

03:02.616 --> 03:05.485
on an old rerun of
a 1950s television show.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.754
There’s this big
roly‐poly bus driver

03:07.788 --> 03:09.823
always trying
to hide things from his wife

03:09.856 --> 03:12.258
every time he does
he gets in trouble.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.860
And he’s got
this friend upstairs.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.730
He wears a vest.
He’s the smart one.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.464
The friend comes down.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.743
Norton!

03:29.776 --> 03:32.513
Norton, get down here
right away! It’s important!

03:32.546 --> 03:34.548
What say there, Ralphie boy?

03:39.485 --> 03:41.421
Sorry, it took so long.
What’s up?

03:41.454 --> 03:45.358
What’s up?
I’ll tell you what’s up.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.762
You and I are in
for a treat tonight.

03:48.795 --> 03:49.830
‐We‐‐
‐W‐w‐wait, don’t tell me.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.398
Let me guess.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.701
Is it Beers Of All Nations Night
down at the Lodge?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.571
Because if it is
I’m gonna have to say no.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.006
I’ve been havin’
very bad problems lately

04:00.040 --> 04:01.775
with the old tum‐tum.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.710
I don’t think I could tolerate
more than a pitcher or two.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
[chuckles]
A pitcher or two there.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.283
Are you gonna let me
tell you where we’re going

04:10.316 --> 04:11.918
or are ya gonna run off
at the mouth all night?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.320
Oh, nah, nah. I’m gonna let ya
tell me. Just go ahead, Ralph.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.789
‐Thank you.
‐Just, uh...

04:15.822 --> 04:17.591
I’m all ears.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.527
Just let me have it, Ralph.
Just let me have it.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.330
Right here, Ralph. Let it rip.
Let it rip there, Ralph.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.733
Just get the thought
and let it out. Let it out.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.712
Norton, you are a mental case.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.817
‐Will you sit down?
‐Alright, Ralph!

04:51.424 --> 04:52.926
You were saying?

04:55.095 --> 04:56.797
Two guys dropped out

04:56.830 --> 04:58.899
of the Pro Am
Bowling Tournament tonight

04:58.932 --> 05:01.768
and you and I are gonna
take their places.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.604
Hold the phone!

05:05.371 --> 05:07.741
We are gonna be bowling
with professionals?

05:07.774 --> 05:09.943
Guys who own their own
bowling shoes?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.778
Va‐va‐va‐voom!

05:11.812 --> 05:14.014
We are a couple
of lucky stiffs!

Hi, Ralph.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.426
Hi, Ed.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.730
The tailor said
he wants to know

05:29.763 --> 05:32.398
who’s wearing these pants,
you or the bus?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.604
Hardy Har Har.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.542
I’m sorry I’m late, Ed, I had to
stop at the butcher shop

05:41.575 --> 05:43.376
to get ya lamb chops
for dinner.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.712
What are ya cooking me
for dinner tonight, Alice?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.114
Nothing. Did you forget? We’re
going to my mother’s for dinner.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.851
[laughing]
Alice, hey,
you’re out of luck there.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.620
‐Uh, Ralph and I are gonna go‐‐
‐No, no, Norton, Norton...

05:53.654 --> 05:56.823
Norton, don’t you have
to go upstairs and eat?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.458
Nah, it’ll take, uh, Trixie

05:58.491 --> 05:59.693
like a half an hour
to cook dinner.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.495
Well, maybe you should go
watch her.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.566
Ralph, I know
when you’re kiddin’.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.667
I’ve seen Trixie cook before.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.769
Hey, Trix, remember
the time you were making ’em

06:08.802 --> 06:13.607
potato pancakes, flipping them,
up they go, down they go.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.077
‐Get out of here!
‐Sheesh! What a grouch!

06:17.110 --> 06:18.612
Come on, Ed.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.114
Alright.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.684
Will you get outta here?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.418
Bye, Alice.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.528
Alright, Ralph,
what’s going on?

06:34.561 --> 06:37.497
Well, uh...

06:37.531 --> 06:38.398
Uh...

06:40.133 --> 06:43.169
I didn’t want
you to know that, uh...

06:43.203 --> 06:46.840
...that, uh, I was gonna work
an extra shift tonight.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.642
Well, why not? You work
extra shifts all the time.

06:49.910 --> 06:54.715
Well, uh...uh...I, uh...

07:01.588 --> 07:04.991
I, uh, I didn’t want
you to know that, uh...

07:05.025 --> 07:06.893
...that I’ve been,
uh, saving up to buy you

07:06.927 --> 07:08.995
that, uh, new refrigerator
you wanted.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.098
And, uh, the money
I was gonna make tonight, uh

07:12.132 --> 07:14.601
would have been enough
for the first down payment.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.469
Oh, Ralph, that’s so sweet!

07:17.771 --> 07:19.740
Too bad
I won’t be able to work.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.508
You want me to have dinner
with your mother

07:21.542 --> 07:24.177
so that’s where I’ll be.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.913
Oh, no, you won’t! You go ahead
and work your shift!

07:26.947 --> 07:28.882
My mother will understand.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.562
‐Hey, Ralph.
‐Ah!

07:41.595 --> 07:42.663
‐You’re good.
‐Ah!

07:42.696 --> 07:45.532
‐Hey, Ralphie boy.
‐Aah! Ah!

07:45.566 --> 07:47.668
Come on, Ralph! You’re doing it.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.769
‐You’re almost there, Ralph.
‐Ah!

07:48.802 --> 07:51.137
Come on, Ralphie.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.939
‐There we are there.
‐Ah!

07:52.973 --> 07:54.641
[groans]

07:54.675 --> 07:56.109
Alright.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.779
[sighs]

07:58.812 --> 08:02.048
I don’t get it, Norton.
How did this happen to me?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.618
Same way as it always happens
when you go bowling.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.252
You picked up
your bowling ball...

08:08.889 --> 08:10.891
...you made your way
to the line.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.136
Then you realize
all eyes are on you.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.271
So, you decided to put somethin’
a little extra on the ball there

08:25.305 --> 08:28.274
just a little somethin’
extra on the ball there

08:28.308 --> 08:31.111
give it a little extra body,
as if you needed extra body.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.919
And then you let her go,
and before you knew it

08:38.952 --> 08:41.321
you were flat on your keister,
just lying there

08:41.354 --> 08:43.690
like a beached whale
waiting for someone

08:43.724 --> 08:45.959
to pull the cup out
of your mouth there, Ralph.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.628
Will you knock it off?

08:49.963 --> 08:52.833
Now look,
Alice will be here any minute.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.169
You gotta help me hide
the fact that I hurt my back.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.606
Uh, wouldn’t it be easier
just to tell her what happened?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.576
"Wouldn’t it be easier just
to tell her what happened?"

09:04.277 --> 09:05.879
Why don’t I just wear
a sign on my back

09:05.912 --> 09:07.848
that says kick me hard?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.984
Not a good idea
with your back out, Ralph.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.722
Oh, you are nuts,
you know that, Norton?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.626
Now listen,
if you help me out tonight

09:19.660 --> 09:20.994
my back will be fine
in the mornin’

09:21.027 --> 09:22.763
and Alice will never know
I went bowlin’.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.901
Ralph, I’m glad you’re here.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.770
I’ve been thinking
about the new refrigerator.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.104
Now, I’m not sure
how it’s gonna look in the space

09:31.137 --> 09:33.106
where the icebox is now,
so why don’t you move

09:33.139 --> 09:35.008
the icebox out of the way
and put something over there

09:35.041 --> 09:36.943
that’s the size of
the new refrigerator?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.287
‐Now?
‐Yeah, Ralph, now.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.291
You know, uh, Alice,
that is a terrific idea.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.425
Really sensational.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.728
You should, uh, look
into becoming one of the, uh...

09:54.761 --> 09:57.898
What do they call, uh, uh,
inferior decorators.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.406
Alice, it’s late. We’ll move
the icebox some other time.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.843
Is there some reason you
don’t want to move the icebox?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.111
No, no reason.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.215
You want it moved,
we’ll move it.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.986
[grunts]

10:25.992 --> 10:28.862
Norton, how about giving me
a hand with this?

10:28.895 --> 10:30.964
‐Sure, Ralphie.
‐Ow!

10:32.098 --> 10:33.834
[grunting]

10:35.268 --> 10:37.938
Ah! Ah!

10:37.971 --> 10:41.241
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

10:41.942 --> 10:44.410
Ah! Ah!

10:46.146 --> 10:49.149
Alright, Norton,
help me pick this thing up.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.054
Okay. On three.
Ready, Ralph?

10:54.087 --> 10:57.357
One...two...
What’d ya got in here?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.125
Will you get outta there?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.695
Three!

11:01.728 --> 11:02.829
[bones cracking]

11:02.863 --> 11:05.065
Ow!

11:05.098 --> 11:07.701
Aah! Aah! Oh!

11:07.734 --> 11:10.103
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Aah!

11:10.136 --> 11:12.238
[banging]

11:12.272 --> 11:13.907
Ooh!

11:16.510 --> 11:19.846
Aah! Aah‐aah! Aah! Aah!

11:19.880 --> 11:22.048
[banging]

11:22.082 --> 11:25.418
Aah! Oh! Aah! Oh!

11:25.451 --> 11:28.454
Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh!

11:28.488 --> 11:30.390
Oh!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.066
Is there something wrong
with your back, Ralph?

11:43.403 --> 11:46.272
No. Why would there be
something wrong with my back?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.373
Because you and me
was bowling‐‐

11:47.407 --> 11:49.810
Will you knock it off?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.978
Listen, Alice, I can explain.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.914
Save your breath, Ralph.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.950
I know everything.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.251
See, the bus from my mother’s

11:58.284 --> 11:59.419
stops in front of
the bowling alley.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.987
A couple of guys
got on talking about

12:01.021 --> 12:02.789
how Kramden threw his back out

12:02.823 --> 12:05.058
and almost rolled down
the alley with the ball.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.230
I’ll be up at Trixie’s
till I calm down.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.404
Hey, hey, hey.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.541
I hate to, uh, rub salt
in your wound there, Ralph.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.908
Ow!

12:24.811 --> 12:26.012
But you should have known
that Alice’s bus

12:26.046 --> 12:27.447
was gonna go by
the bowling alley there.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.249
I mean,
you are a bus driver, right?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.417
I mean, you gotta
use the ol’ noodle.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.453
You are drivin’ that bus there
right down 42nd Street

12:33.486 --> 12:36.356
right to Broadway, the guy
that sells the newspaper there‐‐

12:36.389 --> 12:38.024
Will you knock it off?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.362
Hey, uh, your back looks
pretty bad there, Ralph.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.429
It is bad.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.497
Looks like you can hardly move.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.166
‐I can’t move.
‐Not at all?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.934
‐I can’t move at all.
‐Not at all?

12:47.968 --> 12:49.469
I just told you,
I can’t move at all!

12:49.503 --> 12:52.338
‐Yeah, but not at all?
‐I can’t move at all!

12:52.372 --> 12:54.440
Alright then.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.209
[scatting]

12:58.545 --> 13:02.148
Norton, what’re you...
Norton, put that back!

13:02.182 --> 13:07.353
Norton! Ah! Norton!
I’m gonna murdelize you.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.023
Ah! Ah! Norton!

13:10.056 --> 13:12.859
Next day, Ralph’s back was
so bad, he have to stay home

13:12.893 --> 13:15.128
the whole day
and listen to Alice yell at him.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.463
You see what I’m driving at?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.331
Well, that is television.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.466
It has nothing
to do with real life.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.368
[knock on door]

13:22.402 --> 13:24.838
There is no way in the world

13:24.871 --> 13:28.108
that Jennifer is gonna find out
about that basketball game.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.711
‐Oh, hi, Jen.
‐Hi, Larry.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.046
A messenger just delivered
these basketball tickets

13:33.079 --> 13:35.348
to our apartment
instead of yours.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.216
W‐well, I can explain.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.219
Save your breath,
I know everything.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.155
Larry, you’ve lied to me for
the last time. Enjoy the game.

13:46.459 --> 13:51.364
Oh, what a tangled web we weave

13:51.397 --> 13:55.268
when first
we practice to conceive.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.037
[instrumental music]

14:02.042 --> 14:03.443
[instrumental music]

14:17.691 --> 14:20.861
Cousin...you’re crying.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.164
Didn’t‐didn’t you have any luck?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.167
Balki, I don’t know
what I’m gonna do.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.202
It’s been a week,
Jennifer still won’t talk to me.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.571
I’ve tried everything.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.674
I’ve sent her flowers,
candy, perfume.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.375
She just sends everything back.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.445
I’m beginning to think
it’s all over between us.

14:39.479 --> 14:43.650
Oh, cousin, you’re making
a mountain out of mohair.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.686
Come on,
Jennifer still loves you.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.121
She’ll forgive you if you just
tell her you’re sorry

14:48.154 --> 14:50.591
you were lying
and you’ll never do it again.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.325
She’ll never buy that.

14:54.027 --> 14:59.065
But you know
if I do something heroic

14:59.099 --> 15:01.467
to show how much I love her,
she’ll have to forgive me.

15:01.502 --> 15:03.537
Cousin, that never works!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.438
Now, Ralph had
the same problem with Alice.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.673
She wasn’t talking to him

15:06.707 --> 15:09.009
after he lied about
the bowling incident

15:09.042 --> 15:10.944
so instead of telling her
the truth

15:10.977 --> 15:12.946
he got his friend, Norton,
that’s the smart one

15:12.979 --> 15:16.116
to come down and help him
to, to appear to be a hero

15:16.149 --> 15:17.984
so that
she would like him again.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.225
Hello, Alice.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.030
You havin’ a good day, Alice?

15:30.063 --> 15:31.998
You feelin’ okay?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.467
Trixie, please tell Ralph if he
really cared anything about me

15:34.500 --> 15:37.370
he wouldn’t have lied.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.105
Alice says if you cared
anything about her

15:39.139 --> 15:41.074
you wouldn’t have lied.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.577
Come on, Alice.
Give me a break.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.145
It’s been a week.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.013
Don’t you think
I’ve suffered enough?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.282
Trixie, tell Ralph
as far as I’m concerned

15:49.315 --> 15:51.552
the suffering has barely begun.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.624
‐Alice says‐‐
‐I heard what Alice says.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.562
You think I was the only guy
in the world

16:01.595 --> 16:04.330
who ever lied to his wife?

16:04.364 --> 16:09.035
Norton, you must have lied
to Trixie once or twice.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.505
Well, uh, tell you
the truth there, Ralph, uh

16:11.538 --> 16:14.608
in 13 years of marital bliss

16:14.641 --> 16:17.778
I, uh...I never yet once
lied to Trixie.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.546
Ed said he once thought
about lying to me

16:19.580 --> 16:20.814
but he felt so guilty
he bought me

16:20.847 --> 16:24.450
a big bouquet of flowers and a
bottle of my favorite perfume.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.088
Yeah, and I, uh, I wrote her
a little poem to go with it.

16:32.659 --> 16:37.030
Roses are red,
violets are bluer...

16:38.732 --> 16:42.102
...can you ever forgive
your guy from the sewer?

16:46.239 --> 16:48.041
How do you like that?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.510
He’s a poet, and he don’t
even know that he is.

16:52.613 --> 16:56.249
Alright. Alright.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.052
So I’m a lousy husband.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.154
What do you want me to do?
Say I’m sorry?

17:03.089 --> 17:08.529
Okay, I’m sorry. I’m sorry,
I’m sorry. Now, shut up!

17:17.203 --> 17:20.406
You know, Ralph, the only thing
bigger than your mouth is your‐‐

17:20.440 --> 17:22.509
Don’t say it, Alice!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.848
Come on, Trixie,
let’s go to a movie.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.784
Okay. Bye, Ed.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.591
I hope you choke
on your raisinets.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.563
How do you like that?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.700
Norton, this is killin’ me.

17:48.702 --> 17:49.803
I don’t mind
the silent treatment

17:49.836 --> 17:51.838
but Alice won’t cook for me.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.476
I have to get her
to forgive me.

17:56.510 --> 18:00.681
I can’t take another night of
eating beans out of the can!

18:00.714 --> 18:02.783
I don’t know, Ralph.
She seemed pretty steamed.

18:04.785 --> 18:07.521
Hey, you, uh, you got a fork?

18:07.554 --> 18:10.356
[snaps fingers]
I got it!

18:10.390 --> 18:12.492
If I do something
to prove to Alice

18:12.526 --> 18:15.328
how much I love her,
she’ll have to forgive me.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.397
Now, I got a plan,
but I’m gonna need your help.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.533
I’m with you.
I’m with you a 100%!

18:19.566 --> 18:23.336
Alright, now you are gonna
have to disguise yourself

18:23.369 --> 18:25.872
as a robber and then sneak in
here later tonight.

18:25.906 --> 18:27.273
Now, it’s real important

18:27.307 --> 18:28.642
that Alice doesn’t know
that it’s you.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.876
Don’t worry, Ralph

18:29.910 --> 18:32.145
I once played a tomato
in the school play

18:32.178 --> 18:33.714
and nobody knew it was me.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.486
Hello, there.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.558
I am a tomato.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.695
You may think
I am a vegetable...

18:49.863 --> 18:51.898
...but I am really a fruit.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.744
You’re not a fruit, Norton,
you’re a mental case!

19:07.413 --> 19:09.683
Now, where was I?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.618
Oh, yeah, alright.

19:11.652 --> 19:14.320
Now after you break in here
and say you are a robber

19:14.354 --> 19:17.257
you say that you want
Alice’s wedding ring.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.627
Now, I’ll say that I would
rather die than give it to you.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.629
You’ll be so moved
by the depth of my love

19:22.663 --> 19:25.566
that you’ll leave
without Alice’s wedding ring.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.300
She’ll have to forgive me!

19:30.370 --> 19:32.205
Ralph, I gotta tell you,
I’m touched.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.209
You would rather die
than‐than‐than

19:36.242 --> 19:37.778
let somebody have
Alice’s wedding ring?

19:37.811 --> 19:39.913
[sniffles]

19:39.946 --> 19:44.217
You sweet kid,
but it won’t work.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.720
No, you gotta wine her,
dine her, dance her.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.655
[scatting]

19:48.689 --> 19:50.991
Nah, that won’t work.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.660
[snaps fingers]
I got it. I’ll help her dust.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.765
Nah, why don’t you
just buy her a fur coat?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.435
Nah, that won’t work.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.874
Oh, I think she’s got
a good point there, Ralph.

20:07.908 --> 20:09.643
Ooh!

20:17.283 --> 20:18.752
Alice!

20:18.785 --> 20:20.854
What have you got to say
for yourself now, Ralph?

20:23.957 --> 20:27.928
I got a big mouth!

20:31.064 --> 20:33.033
Alice was so mad
at Ralph that

20:33.066 --> 20:35.035
that not only did
she not speak to him

20:35.068 --> 20:38.004
for, for two weeks, but she make
him sleep on the fire escape.

20:38.038 --> 20:40.674
[laughing]

20:40.707 --> 20:42.375
I love that show.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.979
And you say you can’t learn
anything from television.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.484
I should have known that someone
as wonderful as Jennifer

20:51.518 --> 20:56.389
could never love somebody
as low and devious as me.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.725
Oh, I think she could.

20:58.759 --> 20:59.993
[knock on door]

21:07.400 --> 21:09.035
Larry, is this from you?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.574
‐Well, uh‐‐
‐Cousin, come on.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.610
Don’t be so shy. Of‐of course
it’s‐it’s from Cousin Larry.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.078
Who else would it be from?

21:18.111 --> 21:19.846
Oh, Larry, when I saw
this little guy sitting

21:19.880 --> 21:21.782
on my fire escape
with two tickets

21:21.815 --> 21:25.952
to the ballet in his paws,
I knew I’d been too hard on you.

21:25.986 --> 21:30.757
W‐w‐wait, Jennifer,
I...didn’t leave

21:30.791 --> 21:33.459
t‐that bear on the fire escape.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.862
T‐the person who did
is much nicer than I am

21:35.896 --> 21:39.866
and I think I have a pretty good
idea who that person is.

21:45.606 --> 21:47.808
Balki, was it you?

21:47.841 --> 21:50.644
Well, I was just trying to help.

21:52.613 --> 21:55.716
‐Oh!
‐Oh, oh!

21:55.749 --> 21:58.484
Well, what was that for?

21:58.519 --> 22:00.721
Well, Larry, you could have lied
and said the bear was from you

22:00.754 --> 22:02.889
but you didn’t.
You told the truth!

22:03.990 --> 22:05.425
I did, didn’t I?

22:07.060 --> 22:09.930
I think we’ve had
a breakthrough here!

22:09.963 --> 22:12.465
Well, this is cause
for celebration.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.967
What do you say
we all go out to dinner tonight

22:14.000 --> 22:15.468
at Antoine’s Cajun Kitchen?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.937
Oh, it’s a wonderful idea.

22:16.970 --> 22:18.839
Balki, you wanna call
and make us reservations

22:18.872 --> 22:19.973
for four at 8 o’clock?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.908
Four at 8, you got it!

22:32.185 --> 22:33.920
[scatting]

22:35.789 --> 22:37.524
Will you just make the call?

22:40.827 --> 22:43.697
Baby, you’re the greatest.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.968
[instrumental music]

22:54.508 --> 22:56.042
[theme music]
