WEBVTT

00:10.044 --> 00:11.912
Kai, what do you see?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.847
That makes ten.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.351
We got a full house.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.321
All right. Let's roll.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.626
Keep pace, we make entry in 30.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.295
Don't worry about
my pace, Boone.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.463
I was all-state track and field.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.099
Just hope you make it
worth my while.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.466
The tip was anonymous,

00:32.566 --> 00:33.701
but we don't know for sure
what's inside.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.073
Don't mess this up
like you did last time.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.474
Oh, yeah.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.443
Besides a whole bunch
of dealers and meth.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.046
Drugs on the table, bad guys in
cuffs are the key to my heart.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.015
Ready?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.150
Ready.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.518
Go, go, go!

00:50.618 --> 00:53.087
Federal agents!
Search warrant!

00:53.187 --> 00:55.489
Nobody move!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.292
Hands on the wall, now.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.960
Runner, runner!
We got a runner.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.867
Get off of me!

01:06.967 --> 01:08.336
I didn't do nothing!

01:08.436 --> 01:11.772
Felony weight in meth
says different.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.243
Reminds me
of high school science.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.445
Doubt they made it that far.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.914
What do you got there?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.219
Clear out.
Everybody clear out!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.687
Clear out!

01:58.819 --> 02:01.589
So much for a nice,
quiet bust.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.724
You guys all right?
Oh, yeah.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.058
Peachy.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.094
He means to say toasty.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.396
Did anyone get hurt?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.964
No, but we lost
a lot of the evidence.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.800
Turns out methamphetamine
is incredibly volatile.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.569
Detective Reed, any idea
what caused this explosion?

02:15.669 --> 02:18.005
Dangerous chemicals plus
an unsafe environment

02:18.105 --> 02:19.173
equals big boom.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.009
Kai?

02:22.109 --> 02:23.377
Yeah.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.013
I saw something weird
before the explosion.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.349
Weirder than a
fully-operational meth lab

02:28.449 --> 02:31.018
in the middle of a suburban
neighborhood a mile from Pearl?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.888
Got it.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.424
I saw this

02:36.524 --> 02:39.026
receiving a current
in the corner.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.429
I don't think it's part
of the lab setup.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.064
That's an IED.
And that's
a little receiver,

02:44.164 --> 02:47.335
which probably means...
Someone triggered the device.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.636
This wasn't an accident.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.972
This place was
rigged to blow.

02:52.072 --> 02:55.108
<i>I'm so bored, Kate.
I've got nothing to do here.</i>

02:55.209 --> 02:57.878
I'm confused.
You want more crime?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.280
I want something.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.315
The command investigator's
on emergency leave.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.983
I'm assuming her caseload, too,

03:03.083 --> 03:06.320
and, uh, there's still
nothing to investigate.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.821
Well, isn't that a good thing?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.490
Yes, of course.
We don't like crime,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.592
but when I applied
to Agent Afloat,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.827
I thought it'd be interesting.

03:13.927 --> 03:14.962
You applied for Agent Afloat
to avoid

03:15.062 --> 03:16.264
dealing with your
feelings for me.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.600
No. Not entirely.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.637
I mean, yes, okay, a little,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.038
but we're great now.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.508
I just, I want to feel
useful here.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.877
Hey, you are very useful.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.315
All I've done so far is help
the ship security force

03:34.415 --> 03:36.149
with a toilet paper prank,

03:36.250 --> 03:39.019
investigate someone getting
shorted at the ship store

03:39.119 --> 03:42.022
and look into the case
of the commander's missing hat.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.157
And you solved each one.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.959
Commander didn't even
say thank you.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.496
Should have kept it.
I look great in hats.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.832
I miss you.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.502
I miss you too.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.538
And I want to hear
what's going on with...

03:57.638 --> 03:59.540
Medical emergency.
Medical emergency.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.541
What is that?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.511
Eh, don't worry, it's, uh...
Happens all the time.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.645
It's probably just a drill.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.846
This is not a drill.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.248
NCIS agent Lucy Tara, respond,

04:08.349 --> 04:11.285
port side passageway 2-238-

04:11.385 --> 04:12.553
2-Lima.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.322
Well, that's new.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.156
I, uh, I'll call you later.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.259
Okay, go be useful
and be careful.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.368
What's going on here?

04:27.468 --> 04:28.602
She's unconscious.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.439
Hit her head, ma'am.
Okay, and you are?

04:31.539 --> 04:34.375
Uh, Petty Officer Gattman.
I found her.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.609
You know who she is?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.911
Uh, Ms. Meadows.
The fun boss.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.880
What now?
You know, uh,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.516
does social events,
parties, games.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.185
Fun boss, got it.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.624
Is she gonna be okay?
Yes.
Moving her to sick bay asap.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.894
When'd you find her?
A few minutes ago.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.863
We were
supposed to meet.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.532
She had my bingo winnings.
It was a whole lot of money.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.668
Define a whole lot.
$32,000.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.370
From bingo?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.837
It's a progressive jackpot.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.274
When Ms. Meadows didn't
show up, I went looking.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.577
Is that the bingo box?

05:09.677 --> 05:11.679
Yeah, and there's nothing in it.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.016
Then the fun boss
probably didn't trip.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.919
Is this evidence?
Yeah, evidence

05:19.019 --> 05:20.654
that you've added
your fingerprints to. Oh,

05:20.754 --> 05:23.123
right, uh, dang.
Sh-Should I w-wipe it?

05:23.223 --> 05:24.825
You can just put it down. Yeah.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.227
We're looking at a potential
assault and robbery.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.261
This is a crime scene.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.998
Let's start from the beginning.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.266
Clayton Hickey,

05:33.367 --> 05:35.703
master meth chef.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.638
Operating a ring
that deals

05:37.738 --> 05:40.007
to military personnel.
You want to explain why

05:40.107 --> 05:42.042
your cook house
was rigged to explode?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.111
You know what, I'm gonna be
real honest with you guys, okay?

05:44.211 --> 05:47.415
This is just one big miscommunication.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.982
Do tell.
You see, what happened is

05:49.082 --> 05:51.652
my cousin-- he works at a lab.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.253
He's got a side project.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.556
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna look like meth?

05:55.656 --> 05:57.257
Or explode.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.827
Yeah! Yeah.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.931
Why aren't you guys
saying anything?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.633
Because you won't shut up.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.967
Look.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.804
We know it's your operation,
we know the meth is real,

06:10.904 --> 06:12.940
and we know that
you almost killed

06:13.040 --> 06:13.941
multiple
law enforcements agents,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.676
including my colleague here.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.645
Yeah, and I'm taking
it kind of personal.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.312
Yeah.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.683
But you guys don't really
have anything, right?

06:22.783 --> 06:23.884
'Cause, you know...

06:23.984 --> 06:26.920
It all exploded. Wrong.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.457
We have nine guys
willing to testify against you.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.324
Confirm that it was your lab,

06:31.425 --> 06:32.960
your meth, and your bomb.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.562
Okay, look, I swear to God,
I do not know what happened.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.764
You don't know how your house
turned into a meth lab?

06:36.864 --> 06:39.166
No!
I mean, yeah. Okay, look,

06:39.266 --> 06:42.803
I cook meth, fine, but
I did not try to kill anybody.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.638
Sort of what happens
when you rig it to explode.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.706
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.075
I did not rig anything.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.311
This is my stuff. I'm as
pissed off about it as you are.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.746
Oh, I doubt that.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.347
I don't even know how
to fix a toaster, bro.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.216
But...

06:56.316 --> 06:58.218
I do know
who you're looking for.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.254
Who?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.224
Angela.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.594
My ex.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.930
She has been trying to sabotage
me ever since we split up.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.433
And she is angry enough
to want you dead?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.769
That girl? She's psycho.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.472
Okay? She slashed
my tires a month ago.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.374
Week before that, she poured
bleach all over my plants.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.943
I even put
cameras up all-all

07:23.043 --> 07:25.012
over my house just so
I could catch her in the act.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.782
You put cameras up
all around your house?

07:29.617 --> 07:31.919
To record yourself making meth?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.791
We're gonna need that footage.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.264
♪ Come and get me now ♪

07:47.167 --> 07:48.468
♪ Come and... ♪

07:50.003 --> 07:51.672
Oh, hey.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.940
Dalia.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.709
Is just standing behind me.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.377
It's not awkward at all.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.780
I didn't want to interrupt
the drum solo.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.282
You're here for...

08:02.382 --> 08:04.151
Meth lab footage.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.853
Wondering if our
criminal mastermind

08:05.953 --> 08:07.555
was right about his ex. Oh.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.757
So-- surprise, surprise--

08:09.857 --> 08:11.892
Angela was not our mad bomber.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
Though she did
steal mail from him

08:14.094 --> 08:17.297
and spray paint some nasty words
on his garage door.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.433
No one more vengeful
than a spurned lover.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.570
Present company excluded.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.673
So, we're back
to square one.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.974
Not exactly.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.309
I started to comb
through footage

08:29.409 --> 08:30.778
from the house and...

08:30.878 --> 08:33.246
Look... Sorry.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.583
We need to address
the elephant

08:35.683 --> 08:37.050
in the room. Ernie.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.952
We can handle this like adults.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.954
I know when I stopped texting
you and returning your calls

08:41.054 --> 08:42.455
it was probably like I was...

08:42.556 --> 08:45.893
Completely ghosting me?
Yes, but, in fact, I was...

08:45.993 --> 08:48.028
Just being a
self-centered ass?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.564
Well, I would portray it...

08:50.664 --> 08:53.601
Ernie, stop.
It's fine.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.103
I'm actually
seeing someone.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.105
Oh.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.307
You are?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.910
Cool.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.545
So, the meth lab footage?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.814
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.282
I combed through footage and...
I'm sorry.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.251
This is just
an interesting surprise.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.887
I mean, how long has it been
going on with... Paul.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.890
Paul.
Few months, not long.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.760
But he's special.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.294
And I have you
to thank.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.196
Me? Really?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.965
You taught me what
not to look for.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.903
Hey, Ernie, just checking in
on that footage and, uh...

09:30.003 --> 09:32.005
realizing this
could be a bad time.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.140
No, it's
the perfect time.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.541
We were just
drilling down

09:34.642 --> 09:36.076
on some key data.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.577
Key case-related data?

09:37.678 --> 09:38.979
For sure. Our dealer

09:39.079 --> 09:40.380
certainly
incriminated himself,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.616
but he wasn't
the only one.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.189
This man pulled up to the house
an hour before the raid,

09:49.289 --> 09:52.592
watched the whole thing, drove
away just as it went kaboom.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.095
I've seen him before.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.530
At the coffee shop
where I get my breakfast

09:57.631 --> 09:59.633
and my gym.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.401
Maybe the laundromat?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.904
One place is a coincidence.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.674
Two could be an anomaly,
but three?

10:06.774 --> 10:09.342
He's been following you.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.980
And I was the target
for that bomb.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.056
Kai gave me the rundown of his
routine for the last few weeks.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.125
I compiled all
the locations he's been

10:25.225 --> 10:28.361
and synced them
with nearby CCTV footage.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.864
Our suspect has been
tailing Kai for a while.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.466
Coffee shop and the gym,
like you said,

10:33.566 --> 10:36.636
but also the grocery store,
mani-pedi spa.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.239
Hold on. Mani-pedi spa?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.875
Take care of your feet and
your feet will take care of you.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.143
Boys.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.912
Our suspect has been
all over you, Kai.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.647
We got an anonymous tip
about the meth house.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.282
Suspect could have planted it.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.918
We have footage
of the same man

10:51.018 --> 10:54.387
in a hoodie entering the same
meth house a few days ago.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.058
He rigged the building to blow,
made it look like an accident.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.860
You got an ID
on the guy, Ernie?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.429
Paora Tasi.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.931
Responsible
for racketeering,

11:04.031 --> 11:05.699
armed robbery,
and two counts

11:05.799 --> 11:08.668
of aggravated assault,
and up until a few months ago,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.971
he worked for the Koa Brothers.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.373
Koa Brothers? We
took those guys down.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.775
They got shivved
in prison.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.143
Well, they might be gone,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.978
but their organization remains.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
It's actually grown,
from what I've found out.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.115
'Cause it's being run
by AJ Hale.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.452
That's your old friend, right?

11:26.553 --> 11:27.487
Used to be.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.889
Look, I handed
the info

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
on AJ to the FBI
months ago.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.793
They're supposed to be
building a RICO case.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.128
If AJ knows,
he could be going after you.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.030
All right, let's focus
on finding Paora.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.199
Jesse, find
his known associates.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.234
Ernie, see if you can
dig up any unknown ones.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.503
I'll call Whistler.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.873
AJ Hale is officially
our case again.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.576
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

11:49.676 --> 11:51.411
Yeah, come on in.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.113
Was hoping to go over
your statement again.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.115
Did you happen

11:55.215 --> 11:57.617
to see anyone else on your way
to finding Ms. Meadows?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.786
Yes, ma'am.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.854
Anyone acting suspicious?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.322
Not sure.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.125
Not sure 'cause you can't
remember or you didn't see?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.193
I'm sorry, I...

12:06.293 --> 12:07.761
I just, um...

12:09.229 --> 12:10.998
You think there's any chance
I'm gonna see that money?

12:11.098 --> 12:13.066
Well, it-it's not
for me, you know.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.303
I was hoping to use the winnings
to help out my mom.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.171
Her car broke down, and

12:18.271 --> 12:20.340
I don't want to have to have her
use the bus to work.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.042
If we want to find that money,

12:22.142 --> 12:23.877
we're gonna
have to work together.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.178
So, think back

12:25.278 --> 12:26.613
to that passageway again.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.249
The sailors that
you were passing.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.951
You notice anything off?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.053
Someone, maybe, who
shouldn't have been there?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.754
You know...
Well, it's more like Ms. Meadows

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
shouldn't have been there.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.458
The disbursing office
is starboard side.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.027
We were supposed
to meet there.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.062
So, what was she doing
on the other side of the ship?

12:45.065 --> 12:45.933
As you were.

12:46.033 --> 12:49.269
Go ahead. Continue.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.705
I, uh... Yes, sir. Uh...

12:52.806 --> 12:55.275
We'll catch up later.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.244
You've been very helpful.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.314
XO Ramirez,
what can I do for you?

13:01.414 --> 13:02.782
The captain is deeply troubled

13:02.883 --> 13:04.651
this violent assault
happened on his watch,

13:04.751 --> 13:06.719
and he wants to send
a strong message to the crew

13:06.820 --> 13:08.555
and he's authorized
a full inch-by-inch search

13:08.655 --> 13:10.657
of this carrier.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.294
Uh, sure, we could do that,

13:14.394 --> 13:17.931
but I'm a little concerned our
suspect might get wind of it.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.034
Toss the money overboard
and we'll never ID them.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.836
Well, you have
another suggestion?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.573
Trick or two up my sleeve.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.541
I know you're upset.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.443
AJ tried to blow up
our entire team.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.845
Upset doesn't
quite cover it.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.513
Don't know for certain
it was AJ.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.949
We know our suspect worked
for the Koas and AJ took over

13:36.049 --> 13:37.851
their entire operation, so...

13:37.951 --> 13:39.853
How close is the FBI
to making a case?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.922
We've been building it off
the info we received from Kai

13:42.022 --> 13:43.991
and the witnesses he brought in.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.959
Including my father. Yes.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.328
And this organization AJ's built
is bigger than we thought.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.597
AJ's laundering schemes
are very sophisticated.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.933
LLCs flow into LLCs,
parking money abroad.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.734
Which doesn't
answer the question.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.303
Can you make a case?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.139
Not one that will stick,
not yet.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.608
Why not?
Because there's been
a development.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.443
A number of people
in AJ's organization

14:03.543 --> 14:06.546
have been murdered. Several
others we may never find.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.615
AJ knows the FBI's
investigating him,

14:08.715 --> 14:09.649
so he's cleaning house.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.184
Maybe.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.420
Whistler, come on,
it's not a maybe. It's for sure.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.855
I'm just saying...
That you're taking
your sweet time

14:15.956 --> 14:17.424
while my father
could be next?

14:17.524 --> 14:20.660
Kai. Settle.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.462
Whistler is on
our side, remember?

14:22.562 --> 14:24.264
Look, we need to get this
sorted out before more people

14:24.364 --> 14:26.066
get hurt. Where are we
on finding Paora?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.468
HPD found his car
on the North Shore, but

14:28.568 --> 14:31.238
the trail went cold.
And I've got a dozen agents
trying to track him down.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.406
We'll find him.
Or we just pick AJ up.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.209
We know where he is.
NCIS will put all remaining
manpower into finding Paora.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.778
We bring him in,
we get him to flip on AJ.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
That's our path.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.217
Boss...
Kai,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.653
a word.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.558
I know you're worried your
father might be a target.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.826
Because he is.
But if you can't
control yourself,

14:53.927 --> 14:55.828
you might need to step away.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.330
I was the one who brought
this case to FBI.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.034
I... I got Pops
and his friends to speak.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.936
Which has been invaluable
to the investigation.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.005
What investigation?
Nothing's happened.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.473
And now AJ is killing people.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.508
Look, I have to fix this.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.709
Just go to AJ.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.012
You're smarter
than that, Kai.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.714
You know it
won't end well.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.716
You don't need
to fix anything.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.518
Whatever AJ has become,
it happened

15:18.618 --> 15:20.420
when I was gone from the island.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.692
If... if I had been around...

15:25.792 --> 15:28.361
You're not responsible
for AJ Hale.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.031
Not then, not now.

15:36.403 --> 15:40.440
I put my family
and the team in danger.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.675
I have to do something.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.744
You'll work the case here.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.213
Let Jesse and Whistler
find Paora.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.714
I will get more done
in the field.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.349
Or you'll get
yourself killed.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.321
Until this is resolved,
you stay at Pearl.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.057
At least let me
go check on my dad.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.027
Make it quick.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.235
I was transporting the lockbox.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.004
I felt a push.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.074
Next thing I know, I'm-I'm here.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.608
And you didn't see anyone

16:15.708 --> 16:18.378
or hear any footsteps
or voices?

16:18.478 --> 16:21.048
I wish I could be more help.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.583
You're doing your best.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.218
I do have one question.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.354
Why were you on the
port side of the ship?

16:27.454 --> 16:28.988
What do you mean?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.791
Disbursing office is on
the starboard side,

16:31.891 --> 16:34.861
so is Gattman's quarters.
Just seems odd.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.099
I get turned around sometimes.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
You know, uh...

16:43.136 --> 16:45.305
adjusting to carrier
life can be hard,

16:45.405 --> 16:48.275
for me, at least.
Maybe you, too.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.078
It's lonely being
one of the few non-sailors

16:51.178 --> 16:53.313
on a ship of 5,000.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.517
Like a misshapen puzzle piece. Exactly.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.820
What do you do when you're not
overseeing all the fun--

17:00.920 --> 17:02.389
did you make any friends?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.892
Tracy, I'm not looking
to jam anyone up.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.994
I don't care how
you spend your time

17:08.095 --> 17:10.197
or who you spend it with.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.333
But I do need to find out
who did this to you.

17:15.168 --> 17:19.005
Why were you on the port side
of the ship, Tracy?

17:20.473 --> 17:21.541
I have a friend.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.012
Calvin. A sailor.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.915
Civilian-sailor relationships

17:29.015 --> 17:30.683
are allowed on ships,
why hide it?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.752
It's complicated.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.787
He's going through a divorce.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.988
And you were with Calvin
before delivering

17:36.089 --> 17:37.990
the lockbox yesterday morning?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.828
No one else knew you were there?
No, but,

17:41.928 --> 17:44.164
I swear, he's a good guy.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.134
I'm sure.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.337
I'm gonna need
his last name and rate anyway.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.575
Howzit, Kai?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.943
Hey, where's Pops?

17:57.043 --> 17:58.745
We all got to talk.
Oh, it's never a

17:58.845 --> 18:00.680
"Good. How are you", is it?
Hina.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.249
Now.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.956
Why you got to come
at rush hour?

18:10.056 --> 18:11.658
Listen, we got
a situation with AJ.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.859
Okay, Hina.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.061
You both need to
lay low for a while.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.496
What you mean, lay low?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.531
We got work.

18:18.631 --> 18:22.269
Maybe you don't for a while,
is what I'm saying.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.970
Okay? We need
to shut down.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.706
NCIS will provide protection.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.241
Protection?
What's all this about?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.810
Hey. Pops,
pay attention.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.044
This is serious. Look.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.414
Keep your voice down, son.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.285
Why is AJ here?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.560
What you doing here?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.061
Aloha to you, too, Kai.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.697
There's no aloha between us.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.065
Cool down, brah.
Just here to eat.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.334
That why you brought the muscle?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.135
Roy is an associate.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.104
Bulge in his jacket is a gun.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.306
Hey.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.940
You really think
that you can come here

19:01.040 --> 19:02.642
after everything you did?

19:02.742 --> 19:04.877
Always what I did.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.579
Only thing I ever did

19:06.679 --> 19:07.814
was give your dad

19:07.914 --> 19:10.383
money, take
care of him,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.185
and you pay me back
by trying to lock me up.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.587
'Cause you're a criminal, AJ.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.258
And you're a disgrace
to this entire community.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.128
Guy who left

19:22.229 --> 19:25.298
telling me
I'm a disgrace?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.866
You take advantage
of your people

19:26.966 --> 19:28.468
and then when they get
in your way, you murder them.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.570
You think you
know something?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.572
Do something
about it.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.975
You're always one step ahead,
aren't you?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.344
So, what I'm gonna do,

19:37.444 --> 19:38.845
I'm gonna kick both of you
out right now.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.280
Oh, you want me to go?
Do it yourself. Yeah.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.315
My pleasure.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.783
Nobody's gonna do anything.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.318
Both of you gonna back off,

19:45.418 --> 19:46.286
now, seeing as

19:46.386 --> 19:48.187
you all have an audience.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.965
Yeah, that's Kai.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.501
All talk, no
follow through.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.345
Listen, boss.
Yeah?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.813
Things got out of control.
You don't say.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.448
I lost my temper.
You hit the subject

20:15.548 --> 20:16.683
of an ongoing RICO case
in public,

20:16.783 --> 20:18.818
nearly breaking his jaw.
I'm sorry.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.720
You're lucky that AJ
isn't pressing charges.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.822
Look, he had it
coming. I just... Stop.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.800
I know it was stupid.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.336
But AJ, he threatened my family.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.405
He hired someone to kill me.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.573
Allegedly, Kai.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.815
We need to prove it.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.284
And you have just made that
exponentially harder.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.120
Where do we go from here?

20:54.220 --> 20:56.389
You're not going anywhere.
You're benched.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.858
The rest of us will continue
looking for our bomb suspect.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.360
Try to tie him to AJ.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.761
I can still help.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.063
At Pearl.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.500
AJ-- he knows
we're closing in on him.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.502
He's becoming emotional.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.237
Erratic.

21:11.338 --> 21:15.107
Then we need to find
his breaking point.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.143
Get him to slip up.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.679
<i>I just need to ask
a few questions,</i>

21:19.779 --> 21:21.748
Petty Officer Lynch.
Yes, ma'am.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.683
What's your relationship
to Tracy Meadows?

21:23.783 --> 21:27.019
Uh... we're friendly.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.856
We say hello
when we pass each other.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.691
Have a cup of coffee, maybe.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.926
What is that sound?

21:34.026 --> 21:36.429
It's the, uh, A/C vent, sir.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.565
Been going like that all day.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.866
I'll have engineering
check it out.

21:39.966 --> 21:43.603
Yeah, uh, but, first...
Ms. Meadows.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.940
Sometimes we talk.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.710
Are you and Ms. Meadows in
a sexual relationship, sailor?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.279
XO Ramirez, can I have a word?

22:00.052 --> 22:02.522
Look, I need to remind you
that I'm the investigator.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.690
You're an observer.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.291
You're making
Lynch nervous.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.726
Good. He needs to understand

22:06.826 --> 22:08.361
he could be in serious trouble.
Well, sure,

22:08.461 --> 22:09.662
but if he thinks
he's in trouble,

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
he won't open up,
which is what I'm hoping

22:11.531 --> 22:13.500
to have him do.
See what I mean?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.635
In other words,
let you do your job.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.070
Respectfully.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.674
Thank you.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.479
I'm not your XO

22:26.579 --> 22:27.947
or your C.O.,

22:28.047 --> 22:30.049
I'm just trying to understand
what happened to Tracy,

22:30.149 --> 22:31.951
and I think you want
to know, too.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.788
So, y'all were together
before the assault happened?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.590
Yes, she was
here with me.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.191
And, uh,

22:39.291 --> 22:41.494
where were you
when the assault happened?

22:41.594 --> 22:43.430
On the way to the mess decks
to meet my buddies.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.231
Uh...

22:45.331 --> 22:47.434
do you mind
writing their names down?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.335
Not at all.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.164
I'll be right back.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.667
All done?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.769
No, but we need to get
engineering up here now.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.103
And why's that?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.938
'Cause this just came out
of the air vent

23:26.038 --> 23:28.841
next to Petty Officer Lynch's
rack.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.679
So, we remove the vent,
and there's, like,

23:32.779 --> 23:34.981
2k stuffed inside,
covered in blood,

23:35.081 --> 23:36.716
and suspect stands there
with his mouth open,

23:36.816 --> 23:38.751
shocked we caught him.
Props to you.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.120
Agent Afloat's
all kinds of afloating.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.955
What does that even mean?
I don't know.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.824
I'm only half-listening.
Ernie.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.326
I just solved my first
real case alone.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.662
And yet you don't seem
all that excited.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.163
Well, I'm... super excited.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.299
No, super excited Lucy
is all, "Yee-haw"

23:53.399 --> 23:54.366
and "Y'all know what?"

23:54.467 --> 23:56.536
Okay, that's on-land Lucy.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.772
Sailor Lucy is more reserved.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.242
I don't know,
it-it is weird, though.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.444
Why would Lynch just keep
that money above his bed?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.079
He knew that we would
come talk to him.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.715
And where's the rest of it?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.883
Sailors make tons
of stupid decisions.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.719
Crashing boats, stealing tanks,

24:12.819 --> 24:14.487
wearing hats to the theater.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.922
And when I told Meadows,

24:16.022 --> 24:17.824
she didn't even ask
what'll happen to Lynch,

24:17.924 --> 24:20.426
just that she's done
with "bad relationships."

24:24.463 --> 24:26.899
That's just too much.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.100
I know. I'm missing something.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.269
What?
Oh, you probably are.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.071
I was talking about
this notification.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.441
Dalia posted photos from
her night out at Salsamor.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.443
Oh, Dalia's back in the picture?

24:37.544 --> 24:38.678
Yeah.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.548
But not with me.
Some guy named Paul.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.782
And based on what I can see,

24:42.882 --> 24:45.284
his dance moves

24:45.384 --> 24:46.753
are sloppy.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.188
Are you jealous?

24:49.288 --> 24:50.857
What? No.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.491
Jealousy would require
if I care that

24:52.592 --> 24:53.760
Dalia found some other dude

24:53.860 --> 24:54.861
and no longer
has feelings for me,

24:54.961 --> 24:55.962
but I couldn't care less.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.396
Which is why you set your phone

24:57.496 --> 24:59.031
to get notifications
when she posts

24:59.131 --> 25:01.067
'cause of all the not caring.
I don't know.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.135
Ernie, we're family.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.105
Whatever it is you're feeling,
I can hold it.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.075
Oh, wow.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.243
Lucy, you're so right.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.645
Don't know why
I didn't think of that.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.146
Thank you.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.949
Uh, you're welcome?

25:17.049 --> 25:19.952
Oh, good. You're both here.

25:20.052 --> 25:23.055
I found the missing piece.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.557
You can tie AJ to Paora?

25:24.657 --> 25:25.592
What? No.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.626
You have evidence

25:26.726 --> 25:27.660
that AJ's going after Kai?

25:27.760 --> 25:28.861
Not that, either.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.462
What, then?

25:32.431 --> 25:35.234
Shell companies.
A ton of them.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.803
All used to keep AJ
from being implicated

25:36.903 --> 25:38.404
in illegal activities.

25:38.504 --> 25:39.639
We know this.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.207
And I knew it had
to connect to someone.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.809
And I put
all my impressive skills

25:42.909 --> 25:44.410
to looking
for AJ's fingerprints.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.079
But then Lucy gave me an idea. Wait.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.180
You talked to Lucy?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.016
Yeah, we were video chatting.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.684
How come she
doesn't video chat me?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.419
Clearly, she likes me best.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.287
And the idea?

25:57.690 --> 25:58.991
Whoa.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.028
When you can't hold
onto something yourself,

26:02.128 --> 26:04.296
you give it
to someone else.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.298
Ernie...

26:06.398 --> 26:08.300
you're a genius.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.902
I know.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.447
Mean one, Kalani.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.586
Hey.
We just getting started.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.822
I'm gonna throw another
burger on the grill.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.891
Maybe another dozen.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.359
We're not hungry, Mr. Hale.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.361
Well, unless you're here
to take my statement

26:35.461 --> 26:37.864
about Kai Holman assaulting me,

26:37.964 --> 26:39.298
I got nothing to say.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.834
You don't need
to say a word.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.836
Okay.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.604
This is how it is?

26:52.478 --> 26:54.580
Let's do it.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.816
AJ, what's going on?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.284
Don't worry, Alana.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.585
I'll be back
before the laulau's ready.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.587
Alana Hale,
I'm Special Agent Whistler, FBI.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.756
This is Special
Agent Boone, NCIS.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.924
And you are under arrest.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.092
What?

27:06.192 --> 27:08.160
What do you mean,
I'm under arrest?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.229
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say

27:10.329 --> 27:12.665
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
AJ?

27:12.765 --> 27:14.100
AJ!

27:25.244 --> 27:26.946
I want to talk to my husband.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.648
Your husband's the reason
you're in this room right now.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.484
So why don't you
talk to us first?

27:32.584 --> 27:34.821
About what?
Well,

27:34.921 --> 27:36.388
let's start with the network
of shell companies

27:36.488 --> 27:38.224
and dummy corporations
that you are running millions

27:38.324 --> 27:39.558
in blood money through.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.793
Blood money?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.461
From drugs,
stolen goods, extortion.

27:42.561 --> 27:45.597
I mean, I can keep going.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.100
You're Kai, right?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.669
AJ told me about you.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.139
You were like brothers.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.174
That was a long time ago.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.644
He was there for you when
things got bad with your mom.

27:58.745 --> 28:02.048
He sat with you at her bedside.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.450
He took care of you,

28:04.550 --> 28:06.552
just like a brother should.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.921
And somehow, after all that,

28:09.021 --> 28:12.825
the first time
I see your face is now.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.795
Agent Holman's not
the problem here.

28:15.895 --> 28:20.499
Your husband has put your entire
family in the line of fire.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.501
That's not true.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.136
My husband is a businessman.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.604
He's a kingpin.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.707
Running a criminal enterprise.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.676
No.
Yeah.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.578
It's all here, Alana.

28:32.678 --> 28:35.447
All these businesses
he runs-- they're fronts.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.949
And none of them
are in his name.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.151
It's your name on the paperwork.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.320
And your aunts,

28:41.420 --> 28:44.156
your uncles,
your cousins,

28:44.256 --> 28:45.825
your entire family.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.694
No, this isn't right.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.898
You didn't sign all of those?

28:51.998 --> 28:54.466
I-It was for a family trust.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.135
So we'd be taken care of

28:56.235 --> 28:58.637
if anything ever happened to AJ. Alana,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.639
he lied to you.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.975
He's not protecting the family.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.977
He's implicating them in dozens

29:05.077 --> 29:06.745
of felonies,
including murder.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.081
The Koa brothers,
several others.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.017
My husband is not
capable of that.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.352
Just think about it.
He's changed, right?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.221
The bodyguards, the
layers of protection.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.756
It's not for your family.
It's for him.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.792
Each one of you will
end up in prison

29:19.892 --> 29:22.594
because of what he's done
unless you help.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.196
Talk to us.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.299
You have to think about
what's right for your family.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.606
Hey, Alana's
cooperating.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.542
She'll convince her
family to, as well.

29:36.642 --> 29:37.810
They can get us documents

29:37.910 --> 29:39.311
establishing a direct connection

29:39.411 --> 29:41.047
between AJ and all
of his shell corporations.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.315
That's the ballgame.
We can bring him in now.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.784
Coordinate between
NCIS and the FBI

29:45.885 --> 29:47.619
to all of his known
locations at once.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.089
Kai.
I know.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.891
You get him.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.826
I'll make sure
I get my family somewhere safe.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.228
Please and thank you.

29:58.664 --> 29:59.731
Federal agents!
Search warrant!

29:59.832 --> 30:00.967
Hands up.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.568
Hands!
I want to see your hands.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.336
Get against the wall.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.906
Hands up.
Don't move.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.141
Against the wall.
Against the wall.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.054
Anything?

30:23.022 --> 30:25.057
Nothing.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.727
We hit AJ's office, home
and construction site.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.996
Not to mention
every local business

30:30.096 --> 30:31.630
he co-owns. He's nowhere.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.033
Must have gone off the grid
when we brought in his wife.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.035
Keep agents at every location
until he turns up.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.803
Copy, boss.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.405
And we need Kai back here now.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.806
AJ's a cornered animal.

30:40.907 --> 30:43.142
No telling
what his next move might be.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.913
Hey, I thought this was gonna
be quick. What are you doing?

30:47.013 --> 30:49.415
Balancing last night's receipts.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.550
Now? With a target on your back?

30:51.650 --> 30:54.620
The books can never wait,
especially when the FBI keeps

30:54.720 --> 30:56.155
reviewing them.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.890
All right.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.493
We need to leave. Now.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.096
So go. Take Hina.
I'm fine here.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.934
Oh, I think we're all screwed.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.906
This ends now.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.252
Put the gun down, AJ.

31:26.352 --> 31:29.221
No. No, you're gonna listen.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.889
For once.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.292
You don't want this, son. Relax.
You don't want to hurt anyone.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.527
People are already hurt.
Yeah, because of you.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.895
No, brah.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.397
Because of you!

31:38.497 --> 31:40.366
Why are you
trying to destroy me?

31:40.466 --> 31:43.169
Whatever was going on between us
was between us.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.004
It's bigger than that now, okay?

31:45.104 --> 31:46.572
My family,
your family--

31:46.672 --> 31:48.674
everyone is in danger
because of your choices.

31:48.774 --> 31:51.310
I do what I do

31:51.410 --> 31:52.811
<i>for</i> everyone.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.714
I'm trying to build something.
Yeah?

31:55.814 --> 31:59.551
By killing the Koas?
By taking their business?

31:59.651 --> 32:01.253
You don't listen!
Don't...

32:01.353 --> 32:03.522
Stop moving!
Okay, okay. Hey.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.992
That gun has got
a hair trigger.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.293
One twitch, it goes off.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.528
Shut up!
AJ, look.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.863
Hey, Kai's an ass, but...

32:11.964 --> 32:14.733
it's-it's good advice,
don't you think?

32:16.969 --> 32:18.504
Why you make me do this?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.240
You took my wife in cuffs.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.275
I know it's messed-up.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.013
I know.
Alana's okay.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.414
I talked to her,

32:28.514 --> 32:29.881
and she reminded me
of the friend you were

32:29.982 --> 32:31.517
when Mom got sick.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.320
You were there for me.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.922
And look how I'm repaid.
I know.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.391
But I am here for you
right now, bro.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.127
'Cause there is only two ways
out of this.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.129
One way, you pull that trigger,

32:43.229 --> 32:44.663
this whole thing ends in blood.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.498
Or the other way,
you put the gun down--

32:46.598 --> 32:49.468
just put it down--
and we work this out together.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.970
It's not gonna be easy,
but it's a path.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.951
Alana had no part in this.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.054
Nothing happens
to her, I swear.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.389
And me?
You have to answer

33:10.489 --> 33:11.457
for all of it.

33:11.557 --> 33:12.824
The money laundering.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.393
The Koas' murders,
taking out

33:14.493 --> 33:15.427
your former associates,

33:15.527 --> 33:17.096
trying to kill me.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.597
What are you talking about?

33:18.697 --> 33:21.267
I didn't try to take out
any associates, and-and I never

33:21.367 --> 33:23.935
tried to take you out, either.
Stop lying. Just stop lying.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.205
We know about Paora Tasi.
He's your hit man.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.474
Paora?
Brah, he's first cousins

33:28.574 --> 33:30.008
with the Koas.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.310
He hates me.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.514
Everybody get down!

33:40.719 --> 33:42.654
AJ!

33:42.754 --> 33:44.590
You okay?
Yeah.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.458
Call 911. Don't move from here.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.859
Don't worry.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.031
What do you think
you're doing?
I got to get out of here.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.833
Move, move, move!

33:57.269 --> 33:59.238
What do you see?

33:59.338 --> 34:01.840
Paora and at least three others.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.475
Let me help.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.377
I'm gonna draw them away.

34:05.477 --> 34:09.415
You go back inside, okay?
Protect Pops and Hina. Hey.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.783
You shoot me, I will kill you.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.887
Go!

34:34.140 --> 34:35.407
AJ, get down! Get down!

34:45.551 --> 34:48.487
Put it down. Tell that
traitor to come outside.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.789
Maybe I let your family live.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.925
Actually, how about
you put yours down?

34:54.793 --> 34:56.762
Maybe we let you live.

34:56.862 --> 34:57.796
We who?

34:57.896 --> 35:00.532
My boss, right behind you.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.274
Thanks, boss.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.309
You were supposed to lay low.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.545
I know. I know.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.148
You guys okay?

35:16.248 --> 35:19.551
I'm not okay, dummy.
They were shooting at us.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.287
And the restaurant's a mess.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.355
Who's gonna clean all this up
in time for the breakfast rush?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.357
We'll work on it, Dad, okay?

35:25.457 --> 35:26.825
They're fine.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.461
AJ, I need you
to give me the gun.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.132
Remember, this is the only path.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.568
Give me the gun.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.081
Look after my family, yeah?

35:50.182 --> 35:52.551
Yeah.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.827
Oh. Going somewhere?

36:01.927 --> 36:04.496
Leaving the ship
at the next port.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.432
Need a break
from the fun.

36:06.532 --> 36:10.001
Yeah. These yours?

36:10.101 --> 36:13.239
Yeah. All the ship had was
a chess set with too many rooks

36:13.339 --> 36:15.541
and a deck of cards.
Had to do something.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.743
Want to play a game
before you leave?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.512
Not really.
Come on.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.381
One last go at fun boss?

36:22.481 --> 36:24.650
What's this about?

36:24.750 --> 36:27.152
Man, your commitment
to this job is impressive.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.555
It shouldn't surprise me
since you used to be

36:29.655 --> 36:31.022
an account executive
in Silicon Valley.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.858
I read your
personnel file.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.761
Well, gonna do something,
do it right.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.162
Why do it at all, though?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.398
Go from a six-figure salary
to this?

36:39.498 --> 36:41.300
It was just time for a change.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.668
Hmm.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.070
Wasn't your choice,
though, was it?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.406
Have you been checking up on me?

36:47.506 --> 36:48.740
Know what?

36:48.840 --> 36:50.742
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.712
'Cause this whole robbery
didn't make any sense.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.682
I mean, Petty Officer Lynch
is no criminal.

36:56.782 --> 36:59.285
Maybe a bit naive, but, uh,

36:59.385 --> 37:01.219
you, Tracy Meadows--

37:01.320 --> 37:03.455
you've been through this before.

37:04.256 --> 37:05.891
I don't know what you mean. Well,

37:05.991 --> 37:08.994
your ex, back in San Jose,
got fired

37:09.094 --> 37:11.563
and arrested for
embezzling $200,000

37:11.663 --> 37:13.599
that was never recovered.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.801
A few weeks later,

37:15.901 --> 37:18.670
you quit the same firm,
took a job with the Navy.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.873
I'm the one
who got her head bashed in here.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.742
Gonna do something, do it right.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.412
Okay.
This is ridiculous.

37:26.512 --> 37:29.515
I told you
I have bad luck with men.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.183
I'd say bad luck in general.

37:45.531 --> 37:48.066
Special Agent Tara.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.402
Great work.

37:50.502 --> 37:53.672
Thanks, XO.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.841
Just glad that Petty Officer
Gattman's mom won't have

37:55.941 --> 37:57.343
to take the bus
to work anymore.

37:57.443 --> 38:01.447
I don't know what that means,
but I'm glad, too.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.651
Listen, the captain
is very pleased.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.387
Wants to invite you to dinner
with the department heads

38:08.487 --> 38:10.255
in his in-port cabin tonight.

38:11.256 --> 38:14.159
Wow. Sure.

38:14.259 --> 38:17.095
Sensitive matter to discuss.
Someone's been stealing

38:17.195 --> 38:19.365
frozen strawberries
from the chief's mess.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.900
Really?
No.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.671
It's just some, uh,
some ship humor.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.907
No, Captain wants to thank you
for taking care of our sailors.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.210
And I do, too.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.147
Come hungry.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.984
Hey, Kate.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.319
How's it going on the ship?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.357
Uh... really great, actually.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.660
Oh, yeah? Tell me everything.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.436
What are you doing, Ernie?
What?

38:59.104 --> 39:00.739
Who, me?

39:00.839 --> 39:04.943
Uh, I'm just archiving files
of AJ's operation for the FBI.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.413
Just, those guys
are so bossy over there.
Really?

39:07.513 --> 39:09.280
'Cause from where I'm standing,
it kind of looked like

39:09.381 --> 39:11.683
you were stalking
Dalia's social media.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.919
What?

39:16.722 --> 39:19.357
I know. I was.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.194
I'm so ashamed.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.963
Dude, don't be ashamed,
all right?

39:25.063 --> 39:26.765
She broke your heart.
We've all been there.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.768
No, no, no, that's the thing.
She didn't break my heart, Jess.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.102
I haven't
thought of her

39:31.202 --> 39:33.004
once in the last eight months.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.474
Okay. Something change?
Yeah.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.242
She found a guy. Ah.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.010
And now you realize
how much you care.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.447
No, no. I don't care.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.415
I guess I
feel jealous,

39:43.515 --> 39:45.917
but not of him.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.619
Okay. Then who?

39:47.719 --> 39:50.822
Her, Jess. Her.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.357
I feel jealous
of her because

39:52.458 --> 39:54.359
she found someone
she can go dancing with

39:54.460 --> 39:56.562
and go out
to dinner with, and...

39:56.662 --> 39:59.030
I'm still here with...

39:59.130 --> 40:00.566
you.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.268
Thanks, dude.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.105
I meet all these
great women.

40:07.205 --> 40:10.976
I mean, really terrific,
but none of them stick.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.579
I used to think they
were the problem.

40:13.679 --> 40:16.247
What if it's me?

40:20.051 --> 40:22.754
What if I'm not sticky?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.424
Ernie, you got issues.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.661
A lot. But...

40:29.761 --> 40:31.930
I can honestly say

40:32.030 --> 40:35.366
you're the stickiest guy I know.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.435
You mean it?

40:37.536 --> 40:40.071
Never meant anything more.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.309
Thanks.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.351
Finished my report. Oh.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.487
In record time, I see.
Case took a while.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.857
Just, uh, making sure
I'm not the bottleneck.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.391
How you holding up?

41:01.392 --> 41:02.794
Uh...

41:03.629 --> 41:05.564
AJ is in custody.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.699
Hina and Pops are safe.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.701
He actually, uh,
opened the restaurant

41:09.801 --> 41:11.436
for breakfast
this morning, so...

41:13.238 --> 41:15.507
You didn't answer my question.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.944
I'm fine.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.479
It's okay if you're not.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.183
You just took
down a friend.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.553
And no matter what he did,

41:27.653 --> 41:29.855
that's hard.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.424
I keep on thinking
back to school.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.593
These kids--

41:34.693 --> 41:36.595
they were giving me a hard time.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.130
I was super shy back then.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.133
AJ steps in
and he makes it clear

41:42.233 --> 41:43.468
if they want to start trouble,

41:43.569 --> 41:45.503
they start trouble
with him, too.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.974
I didn't even know him
and he was willing

41:49.074 --> 41:50.842
to fight for me.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.282
So, what do I do now?

41:57.382 --> 41:59.417
You have a seat.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.859
And we have a drink.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.002
Kai, I want you to know...

42:18.336 --> 42:21.206
...that there are still people
who will fight for you.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.018
Thanks, boss.
