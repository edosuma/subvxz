WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:01.359
Previously on Good Trouble

00:01.687 --> 00:02.850
What the hell are you doing?

00:02.875 --> 00:04.409
I'm totally over Sumi.

00:04.444 --> 00:07.544
But I'm not over wanting
that second date with you.

00:07.579 --> 00:09.279
He is hot!

00:09.315 --> 00:10.647
- Who knew?
- Oh, I knew.

00:10.683 --> 00:12.849
Why didn't you tell me you're
not seeing Gael anymore?

00:12.884 --> 00:14.796
Let's walk in there and demand
the raises that we deserve.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.453
We signed non-disclosure agreements.

00:16.488 --> 00:17.821
Then we do it anonymously.

00:17.856 --> 00:19.200
With a new shooting every month,

00:19.224 --> 00:20.868
people forget by the time
the case gets to court.

00:20.892 --> 00:22.025
I won't forget.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.427
Thank you.

00:23.462 --> 00:24.928
You know stuff about me.

00:24.963 --> 00:27.230
What do I know about you intimately?

00:27.265 --> 00:29.466
- Uh, who's your judge?
- Judge Wilson. What about you?

00:29.501 --> 00:31.435
- Judge Handelman.
- Handelman?

00:31.470 --> 00:33.603
Becca, did Handelman
sexually harass you?

00:33.639 --> 00:35.116
I wonder if it's happening to Kate.

00:35.140 --> 00:38.041
I filed a sexual harassment
complaint against Judge Handelman.

00:38.076 --> 00:39.509
We still have company.

00:39.545 --> 00:41.345
Sorry, I thought they were gone.

00:41.380 --> 00:43.347
I don't think you can prove that Wilson

00:43.382 --> 00:45.281
is feeling pressure
to go easy on the LAPD.

00:45.317 --> 00:47.684
We could use Tate's
situation to lean on Wilson.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.252
You think Wilson can be bought?

00:49.287 --> 00:50.564
I've reached my decision.

00:50.588 --> 00:52.288
Officer Griffin's personnel records

00:52.324 --> 00:53.823
will remain sealed.

00:58.864 --> 01:01.430
So, don't mention The Coterie.

01:01.466 --> 01:02.732
Or Malika.

01:02.767 --> 01:05.034
Or anything having to
do with the Jamal case.

01:06.137 --> 01:08.404
In fact, try to avoid
politics all together.

01:08.439 --> 01:09.672
And religion.

01:09.707 --> 01:11.640
And anything controversial.

01:11.676 --> 01:13.209
We're controversial.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.512
What? You're running as a progressive.

01:17.482 --> 01:19.983
Don't worry, sweetheart. We
will be on our best behavior.

01:20.018 --> 01:22.352
Yes. We're full of
compromises these days.

01:25.156 --> 01:26.256
I'm...

01:27.658 --> 01:29.725
not sure that I can do this anymore.

01:34.399 --> 01:35.831
What's going on?

01:35.867 --> 01:37.199
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.139
Welcome.

01:44.174 --> 01:45.641
Please come in.

01:45.676 --> 01:46.809
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:46.844 --> 01:47.877
Hello.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.913
- How are you?
- Hello.

01:50.948 --> 01:52.314
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.183
Well, we are so delighted you're here.

01:55.219 --> 01:56.952
Judge Wilson and Mrs. Wilson...

01:56.987 --> 01:58.253
Oh, please call me Libby.

01:58.956 --> 02:01.957
Uh, these are my moms, Stef and Lena.

02:01.992 --> 02:03.191
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Stef.

02:03.227 --> 02:04.772
- Nice to meet you, Libby.
- Pleasure. Hi, nice to meet you.

02:04.796 --> 02:06.796
- Nice to meet you.
- And my sister, Mariana.

02:06.831 --> 02:08.130
- Hi.
- Hello, welcome.

02:08.164 --> 02:10.264
- I've heard so much about you, Judge.
- Your Honor.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.867
Oh. Well... all good things.

02:12.903 --> 02:14.403
I highly doubt that.

02:16.807 --> 02:18.140
And this is Jamie.

02:18.175 --> 02:20.142
- Hey, Jamie.
- Honor to meet you, sir.

02:21.011 --> 02:22.389
Well, I'm so glad we could do this.

02:22.413 --> 02:24.508
My husband is quite fond of Callie.

02:24.533 --> 02:25.690
I highly doubt that.

02:28.385 --> 02:31.019
Well, we are quite fond of her as well.

02:31.055 --> 02:32.332
Let's all go into the living room.

02:32.356 --> 02:34.089
What's everyone drinking?

02:34.992 --> 02:36.691
Nothing for you.

02:42.199 --> 02:44.232
This is our... our son, Tate.

02:45.635 --> 02:47.169
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

02:47.804 --> 02:49.871
So I'm to blame for you getting arrested

02:49.906 --> 02:53.307
for a DUI and taking a
swing at a police officer?

02:53.343 --> 02:55.042
Sorry you have to work for an asshole.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.348
Callie, I don't believe the
two of you ever formally met.

03:01.117 --> 03:02.117
No. Hi.

03:02.752 --> 03:03.752
Nice to meet you.

03:03.776 --> 03:08.776

03:31.214 --> 03:34.781
They managed to find cause to
excuse six potential black jurors.

03:34.817 --> 03:37.051
And then they used one of
their three peremptory strikes

03:37.086 --> 03:39.953
against the one black juror they
couldn't find cause to excuse.

03:40.192 --> 03:43.493
I don't see why Jamal's attorney
didn't raise a Batson Challenge.

03:49.565 --> 03:52.333
Because lawyers are trained in
bullshit race-neutral excuses

03:52.368 --> 03:54.168
that make it almost impossible

03:54.203 --> 03:56.437
to prove discrimination was intentional.

03:56.472 --> 03:58.339
Wow.

03:58.374 --> 03:59.751
Better not let your corporate clients

03:59.775 --> 04:01.509
- hear you talking like that.
- Ooh, yeah?

04:01.544 --> 04:03.677
That kind of talk turn you on?

04:03.712 --> 04:05.146
Maybe.

04:08.918 --> 04:10.958
It's not like Wilson would
rule in our favor anyway.

04:10.986 --> 04:12.819
The plaintiff's favor.

04:12.855 --> 04:15.088
I never thought being a clerk
was going to be this hard.

04:16.091 --> 04:17.535
Even for a conservative judge.

04:17.559 --> 04:20.993
You're an advocate. You're
not meant for the judiciary.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.396
Just remember you're not
gonna be a clerk forever.

04:30.238 --> 04:32.016
I just want to be able to do something.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.384
You're constantly in Wilson's ear.

04:33.408 --> 04:35.341
Yeah, well a lot of good that's done.

04:35.377 --> 04:36.521
And he wouldn't let any of us see

04:36.545 --> 04:38.289
what was in Officer
Griffin's personnel files.

04:38.313 --> 04:40.613
What if he is siding with the police

04:40.648 --> 04:42.182
to protect his son from going to jail?

04:43.251 --> 04:45.552
Do you really think if Wilson favors

04:45.587 --> 04:46.919
the defense in this trial,

04:46.955 --> 04:49.189
that the new police chief
will use his connections

04:49.224 --> 04:51.991
in the Berkeley PD to get the
charges against his son dropped?

04:52.026 --> 04:53.726
Or reduced?

05:03.771 --> 05:06.572
You think I'm some crazy
conspiracy theorist?

05:07.842 --> 05:10.643
I think the constraints of
clerking are frustrating.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.946
But... don't kick the hornet's nest

05:13.982 --> 05:15.815
and blow up your career.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.116
Get through this,

05:17.151 --> 05:18.751
then go to the ACLU,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.920
or wherever you can
to make a real impact.

05:26.995 --> 05:29.595
We'll now resume day
two of jury selection.

05:37.238 --> 05:39.338
Had you heard of Jamal
Thompson before today?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.740
- Yes.
- Can you explain in what context?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.875
I heard about him in the news.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.656
Do you know anyone who's
currently incarcerated for a crime?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.313
Are you a fan of rap music?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.517
Have you ever been in a gang?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.385
Have you ever smoked marijuana?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.122
How's the secret spreadsheet going?

05:57.158 --> 05:59.625
Oh. Well, we've got more women on board

05:59.660 --> 06:01.627
but yours is the only
male salary that we have

06:01.662 --> 06:03.006
and we need more than one to prove

06:03.030 --> 06:04.596
that there's an actual gender pay gap.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.231
I did, however...

06:06.267 --> 06:08.333
find a pay gap among
the women based on...

06:08.369 --> 06:09.434
Race.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.237
I know it's touchy but...

06:12.273 --> 06:16.375
although we were able to
disclose our salaries anonymously,

06:16.410 --> 06:19.778
I was able to discern a
race pay gap between us.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.613
I was hired around the same time

06:21.649 --> 06:23.381
as another white female engineer,

06:23.416 --> 06:24.882
who shall remain nameless.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.784
Everyone knows we were
hired at the same time.

06:27.953 --> 06:29.920
As I said, not naming any names.

06:29.955 --> 06:32.223
But, it's just another example

06:32.258 --> 06:34.458
of the discriminatory
culture at Speckulate

06:34.494 --> 06:35.993
and in tech in general.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.595
So I think that we should add

06:37.630 --> 06:39.330
a race column to the spreadsheet

06:39.365 --> 06:42.099
to point out that gender is
not the only pay gap issue.

06:42.134 --> 06:44.602
Personally, like... For me, I...

06:44.637 --> 06:46.637
always thought we were
fighting for all women.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.673
Is that column necessary?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.874
Well, yeah, when...

06:50.910 --> 06:52.643
some of us are getting left behind.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.111
100%. But...

06:54.146 --> 06:56.647
shouldn't we address
the gender pay gap first

06:56.683 --> 06:58.115
and then race?

06:58.150 --> 06:59.850
We don't want to confuse things.

06:59.885 --> 07:01.352
I agree.

07:01.387 --> 07:02.886
One issue at a time.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.692
She's the only other woman
of color in Fight Club

07:08.727 --> 07:10.093
and she totally caved.

07:10.128 --> 07:11.361
What's up with that?

07:13.398 --> 07:15.365
Wait, is that Raj and Mariana

07:15.400 --> 07:18.268
or am I seeing a "Miraj?"

07:18.303 --> 07:20.637
Wait, I don't want to know.

07:20.672 --> 07:22.706
Well, Alex, something
you might want to know is

07:22.741 --> 07:24.874
I found a glitch in your
part of the new app build.

07:24.909 --> 07:26.142
Oh, is that so?

07:26.177 --> 07:27.877
Yes, you're not storing a saved state.

07:27.912 --> 07:30.447
So when I leave the app
and go to another one

07:30.482 --> 07:32.148
and come back, my GIF is gone.

07:33.852 --> 07:36.886
Oh. Okay, well... duh.

07:36.921 --> 07:39.522
I would have caught that but

07:39.558 --> 07:41.658
since you have time to
check everyone's work

07:41.693 --> 07:44.294
why don't you stay late
and fix it yourself?

07:49.868 --> 07:52.334
Your Honor, we'd like to use
our second peremptory strike

07:52.370 --> 07:54.336
to excuse juror number 426.

07:56.707 --> 07:57.874
I'll allow it.

08:06.350 --> 08:09.551
Your honor, at this time we would
like to raise a Batson Challenge.

08:14.558 --> 08:16.959
They're wasting their time
with the Batson Challenge.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.929
It's almost impossible to prove.

08:24.669 --> 08:26.803
Oh, hey.

08:35.513 --> 08:36.611
Your Honor.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.548
If you're here to argue for the Batson,

08:39.582 --> 08:41.784
can you wait until they
present their brief?

08:42.285 --> 08:45.454
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about Judge Handelman.

08:45.489 --> 08:48.824
I'm sure you heard he's resigned.

08:48.859 --> 08:50.526
I did.

08:50.561 --> 08:53.128
Handelman's clerk, Kate,
is out of a clerkship now.

08:55.498 --> 08:56.932
That's unfortunate.

08:57.968 --> 09:01.203
Would you consider hiring
her as Rebecca's replacement?

09:02.206 --> 09:05.040
You pushed Rebecca into coming forward

09:05.075 --> 09:06.441
and me...

09:06.476 --> 09:08.276
to publicly censure Handelman,

09:08.312 --> 09:11.313
and now you want me to take
in the collateral damage?

09:11.348 --> 09:14.316
You have a lot of nerve.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.420
Look, I'm sorry that
she lost her clerkship,

09:19.456 --> 09:22.324
but Handelman's a liberal
judge with liberal clerks.

09:23.393 --> 09:25.526
I can't handle two of you.

09:28.365 --> 09:30.646
Stay tuned. Stay tuned.

09:33.237 --> 09:36.003
Callie, these old videos
from Jamal just surfaced.

09:41.277 --> 09:42.957
Black women be less than.

09:43.980 --> 09:47.547
I don't want nothing black
but a black on black whip.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.782
A drop top.

09:48.817 --> 09:51.385
A'ight? Man, dark
women make darker days.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.660
Ain't nobody got time for
that, you know what I'm saying?

09:54.790 --> 09:57.035
Plus I'm with this
Japanese girl right now.

09:57.059 --> 09:58.926
You know, 'cause
Blasian babies are fire.

09:58.961 --> 10:00.961
So, uh...

10:00.997 --> 10:03.297
Stay tuned. Stay tuned.

10:17.449 --> 10:18.675
I would like to propose a toast.

10:18.699 --> 10:20.799
When Callie told me...

10:20.943 --> 10:23.276
My parent's are in town.

10:23.316 --> 10:24.983
I wondered if I could
leave early tonight.

10:25.018 --> 10:27.519
Oh, well, why didn't
you mention this earlier?

10:27.554 --> 10:29.654
I'd love to meet your... parents.

10:30.557 --> 10:32.958
I was hoping that we could
invite you over for dinner.

10:33.594 --> 10:36.027
- But...
- We have reservations.

10:36.062 --> 10:37.362
Cancel them.

10:37.397 --> 10:39.437
Bring them over to the
house for a home-cooked meal.

10:39.466 --> 10:41.276
See, I can't cancel them 'cause...

10:41.301 --> 10:42.912
She explained that her boyfriend

10:42.936 --> 10:44.268
was taking you out.

10:45.472 --> 10:48.272
So I finally got her to agree to...

10:48.308 --> 10:49.422
- Drinks.
- Drinks?

10:49.423 --> 10:50.423
Yeah, before dinner.

10:50.424 --> 10:51.991
See, my sister's also coming.

10:52.012 --> 10:53.645
Bring your sister and your boyfriend.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.248
I always enjoy getting to know my
clerk's friends and family so...

10:57.283 --> 10:59.817
Welcome, one and all.

10:59.852 --> 11:01.051
Here, here.

11:01.086 --> 11:02.352
Stef and Lena.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.992
You've raised a very
impressive young woman.

11:08.027 --> 11:09.927
I hope you're proud of her because

11:09.962 --> 11:11.629
you have every right to be.

11:11.664 --> 11:14.197
- Aw, thank you.
- We are.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.966
Kudos to you.

11:16.969 --> 11:22.205
Callie, you didn't grow up
with privilege like my children.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.108
You lost your parents at a young age,

11:25.144 --> 11:27.545
you went into foster care,

11:27.580 --> 11:29.713
passed from home to home,

11:29.749 --> 11:32.382
and in spite of being
a juvenile delinquent,

11:32.418 --> 11:34.751
you turned it all around

11:34.786 --> 11:37.253
and you made something of yourself

11:37.288 --> 11:39.355
and your life.

11:39.390 --> 11:41.724
You're truly an inspiration

11:41.760 --> 11:43.026
and an example.

11:43.061 --> 11:44.928
And I'm honored...

11:44.963 --> 11:46.863
to be an early mentor in...

11:46.898 --> 11:49.899
what I expect to be a
very successful career.

11:52.671 --> 11:53.736
Cheers.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.319
What?

12:10.354 --> 12:13.589
Okay, so... I have a personal policy

12:13.624 --> 12:15.691
that I don't date people who aren't out.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.395
Especially not to their family.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.464
You could have just ghosted me.

12:21.499 --> 12:23.110
Save yourself the
trip. I wouldn't have...

12:23.134 --> 12:24.733
I'm not ghosting you.

12:26.003 --> 12:27.603
I'm breaking my rule.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.239
Because something tells
me that you're worth it.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.243
- I am?
- Yeah.

12:42.420 --> 12:43.919
Oh, hey.

12:43.954 --> 12:48.756
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

12:48.791 --> 12:49.957
What's up?

12:51.394 --> 12:54.929
I just wanted to, uh,
return this hair tie.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.500
Oh. Thanks.

13:00.604 --> 13:03.204
And I'm cooking dinner tonight

13:03.240 --> 13:06.274
for Meera and you should both join us.

13:08.111 --> 13:10.645
Um... well, we...

13:10.680 --> 13:12.813
- Sure.
- Great.

13:12.849 --> 13:14.349
See you at eight.

13:19.588 --> 13:22.055
Yeah, mine are more elastic-y.

13:22.090 --> 13:25.025
- Mm.
- So she likes these.

13:26.028 --> 13:29.329
- Jamal really got me feeling some
type of way right now. - Mm-hmm.

13:29.365 --> 13:31.831
I mean, his case in the
middle of jury selection.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.634
How is this going to affect that?

13:33.669 --> 13:36.203
First off, you'd be lucky
if you get any black jurors.

13:36.238 --> 13:39.005
But see, I don't think they're
gonna hold this against Jamal.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.175
And they better not
'cause if those cops walk,

13:41.210 --> 13:43.009
all they gonna do is kill more of us.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.444
And it's nothing new.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.991
I used to hate when my mom would
make me wear cornrows to school.

13:47.015 --> 13:48.982
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Kids
would make hella fun of me.

13:49.017 --> 13:51.718
Especially the one black boy in class.

13:51.753 --> 13:52.786
- Justin.
- Of course.

13:52.821 --> 13:55.421
He used to say that I would be so pretty

13:55.456 --> 13:57.957
if I just had long, blonde hair.

13:57.993 --> 13:59.092
Right.

14:00.195 --> 14:02.361
I bet none of the matches
on your phone look like me.

14:02.397 --> 14:03.462
Well, let me just...

14:03.833 --> 14:06.950
You said it yourself, you're
more of a Kate Hudson guy.

14:06.975 --> 14:08.403
But real talk...

14:08.443 --> 14:09.443
I'm here for the cause

14:09.477 --> 14:11.611
but do we have to
support this black guy?

14:11.646 --> 14:12.679
Mmm.

14:12.714 --> 14:14.347
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:14.382 --> 14:16.316
Malika, how's his momma?

14:16.351 --> 14:17.717
I mean, where's her head at?

14:17.752 --> 14:18.963
What's she think about all this?

14:18.987 --> 14:20.220
Did you talk to her?

14:20.255 --> 14:22.988
Not yet, but I mean, Sandra is a badass

14:23.024 --> 14:25.024
and if anyone can handle this, it's her.

14:25.059 --> 14:26.992
- Well, you know what? Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

14:27.028 --> 14:28.828
Yes. And... to Jamal.

14:28.863 --> 14:30.229
- What the hell?
- Oh, no.

14:30.264 --> 14:33.833
'Cause if you don't want
to kiss my big black lips.

14:33.868 --> 14:35.145
- Okay, come on with it.
- You know?

14:35.169 --> 14:37.903
You can kiss my big black ass.

14:37.939 --> 14:39.305
Okay?

14:39.340 --> 14:41.118
- You can kiss that big black ass.
- That's it, girl!

14:41.142 --> 14:42.419
- Kiss that big black ass.
- Kiss it!

14:42.443 --> 14:45.211
My big black ass gonna fight
for your big black life.

14:45.246 --> 14:47.179
- Preach!
- Put some respect on your name.

14:47.215 --> 14:49.215
- Put some respect!
- Black women did that.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.117
- Who raised you, Jamal?
- A black woman!

14:52.153 --> 14:55.186
- Who's fighting for you right now?
- A black woman!

14:55.222 --> 14:57.621
- Okay, here we go.
- Yes. Cheers.

14:57.657 --> 14:59.190
- To kissing black asses.
- Yup!

14:59.226 --> 15:00.658
- Yes.
- Amen.

15:25.287 --> 15:27.287
I can't stop...

15:27.287 --> 15:30.455
reading the tweets and
the comments about him.

15:30.491 --> 15:33.191
And me.

15:33.227 --> 15:35.527
The things people say.

15:35.562 --> 15:37.295
You shouldn't read all that.

15:37.331 --> 15:38.630
That I wasn't a good mother.

15:38.665 --> 15:41.099
That I was probably working too much.

15:41.135 --> 15:42.567
Wasn't around enough.

15:42.603 --> 15:44.302
That I moved into a white neighborhood

15:44.338 --> 15:45.870
and I put Jamal at risk.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.539
Don't do that.

15:47.574 --> 15:49.274
Don't...

15:57.950 --> 15:59.750
Jamal had these posters in his room

15:59.785 --> 16:02.153
and I didn't know who these women were

16:02.188 --> 16:03.687
but they were never black.

16:03.722 --> 16:06.056
I could have asked him about them.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.958
I could have said something.

16:07.993 --> 16:10.394
I can't stop thinking

16:10.429 --> 16:12.763
he must have hated me too.

16:16.469 --> 16:17.901
They don't know you.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.336
They just want someone to blame.

16:19.372 --> 16:21.572
Maybe they should blame me.

16:23.242 --> 16:25.475
I have to go. Um...

16:25.510 --> 16:27.843
Work called on the way over here and...

16:27.879 --> 16:30.246
they need me to close, so...

16:30.282 --> 16:31.981
Oh, okay. You can't stay?

16:33.318 --> 16:35.718
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

16:46.431 --> 16:48.798
Wow, um, everything looks so nice.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.967
- Are those...?
- Gardenia scented candles.

16:52.003 --> 16:53.469
Your favorite.

16:53.505 --> 16:54.970
And I made panzanella.

16:55.006 --> 16:56.506
What's panzanella?

16:56.541 --> 16:59.008
It's like bread salad, basically.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.776
So, I heard you and Sumi
just had the best time

17:01.812 --> 17:03.048
at Davia's birthday.

17:03.073 --> 17:05.374
I didn't say the best time.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.566
We've has so many fun times together.

17:09.256 --> 17:10.454
What do you do for fun, Joey?

17:10.491 --> 17:11.923
Oh, she has a radio show.

17:11.958 --> 17:14.392
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, in fact, Alice was a guest on it.

17:14.428 --> 17:16.027
Isn't that right, Alice?

17:16.061 --> 17:18.695
- Um...
- Oh, my gosh. Why didn't you tell me?

17:18.732 --> 17:20.098
How was she?

17:20.134 --> 17:22.000
Uh... funny.

17:22.035 --> 17:25.403
Well, duh. She's like the
funniest person I know.

17:25.439 --> 17:27.039
When are you gonna start doing stand up?

17:27.073 --> 17:28.884
Well, I... Um... I...

17:28.909 --> 17:29.956
You know, maybe you could use some of

17:29.980 --> 17:31.588
those hysterical bits
you used on the show.

17:31.612 --> 17:33.278
Wait! You heard it?

17:33.313 --> 17:34.613
Why didn't you tell me?

17:34.648 --> 17:36.714
Well, because I've barely seen you.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.450
I wanna hear it. Just
tell me, like, one joke.

17:39.485 --> 17:41.853
I mean, they weren't jokes technically,

17:41.888 --> 17:44.321
you know, I was kind of...

17:44.357 --> 17:46.323
- going...
- More talking about you.

17:47.093 --> 17:48.259
Me?

17:49.796 --> 17:51.129
What did you say?

17:51.164 --> 17:53.297
Um... I don't remember.

17:53.332 --> 17:55.800
- No.
- Oh, there was the one about how you caught her

17:55.835 --> 17:57.835
looking at her reflection in a fork.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.142
I totally did that.

18:04.177 --> 18:06.477
I didn't want to go to the bathroom

18:06.512 --> 18:07.552
just to look in the mirror

18:07.580 --> 18:10.314
and that fork was so shiny.

18:10.349 --> 18:11.783
What else?

18:15.088 --> 18:17.388
Hey. Just saw the tweets. Are you okay?

18:17.423 --> 18:19.290
Yeah, I'm fine. I've got work to do.

18:19.325 --> 18:21.425
Wait, you're not...

18:21.460 --> 18:23.594
You're not still going
through with the protest?

18:24.430 --> 18:26.630
After all that shit Jamal said?

18:26.666 --> 18:27.706
Well, I'm not going

18:27.733 --> 18:29.200
'cause I stand with black women.

18:29.235 --> 18:30.634
You were never going anyway

18:30.670 --> 18:32.303
so don't use this as
a convenient excuse.

18:32.338 --> 18:34.771
I was going.

18:34.807 --> 18:35.972
Probably.

18:36.822 --> 18:38.822
Hey.

18:38.847 --> 18:40.380
Yes, I am still doing the protest.

18:40.465 --> 18:42.145
I am still marching
and fighting for Jamal.

18:42.181 --> 18:45.015
- Okay?
- I just don't understand why you'd work so hard

18:45.050 --> 18:47.017
for someone who thought
so little of you.

18:47.052 --> 18:49.919
Would you still march for a
white guy who said those things?

18:49.954 --> 18:52.021
If he was unjustly
gunned down by the police,

18:52.056 --> 18:54.056
then yeah, I'd still
think he'd deserve justice.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.826
Or... do you think Jamal
deserved what he got?

18:56.861 --> 18:58.160
No, of course not.

18:58.196 --> 19:01.497
Okay. So the point is you don't get it.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.633
- Well, then explain it to me.
- Why?

19:04.869 --> 19:07.604
Why is it on me to educate
all my white friends?

19:07.639 --> 19:09.572
You went to Brown. Read a book, Davia.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.275
- Do some research.
- Okay. Here's what it is.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.410
What Jamal said was messed up

19:14.446 --> 19:16.246
but that doesn't matter right now

19:16.281 --> 19:18.013
because those are two separate issues.

19:18.049 --> 19:19.560
We need to focus on justice for Jamal...

19:19.584 --> 19:22.618
Yeah, so these issues are not separate.

19:22.653 --> 19:24.018
We need to focus on all of it.

19:24.054 --> 19:26.622
And not leave behind the
most marginalized in our group

19:26.657 --> 19:29.558
which happens to include black women.

19:29.593 --> 19:32.160
Isaac is just trying to explain

19:32.195 --> 19:33.895
because you won't.

19:33.930 --> 19:36.030
I think you're getting,
like, way too emotional

19:36.066 --> 19:37.176
you just need to calm down.

19:37.201 --> 19:38.210
- Wow.
- No.

19:38.235 --> 19:39.301
Uh-oh.

19:39.336 --> 19:40.669
Tell me why every time

19:40.704 --> 19:42.337
I end up in a conversation like this,

19:42.373 --> 19:44.239
somebody tells me to calm down.

19:46.777 --> 19:48.777
What the...

19:48.812 --> 19:52.281
So, when we first met,
it was in a lesbian club

19:52.316 --> 19:55.617
and she claims that
somebody ran into her

19:55.653 --> 19:58.086
and she spilled her
entire drink down my shirt,

19:58.121 --> 20:00.454
and she started dabbing
at my chest with napkins

20:00.490 --> 20:02.123
and then she said...

20:02.159 --> 20:04.325
"Now that we're at second base,

20:04.360 --> 20:06.194
can I get your number?"

20:06.229 --> 20:08.429
Uh, so how did you and Meera meet?

20:08.464 --> 20:10.498
Oh, that's a boring story.

20:10.533 --> 20:13.001
For the record, uh,

20:13.036 --> 20:15.203
someone did bump into me.

20:15.238 --> 20:16.838
The point is,

20:16.873 --> 20:20.241
I've always accepted
Alice for who she is

20:20.277 --> 20:23.678
and supported her decision
not to come out to her parents

20:23.713 --> 20:26.080
until she's ready, if she's ever ready.

20:26.116 --> 20:27.415
What are you talking about?

20:27.450 --> 20:29.450
How is that the point of anything?

20:29.485 --> 20:31.686
Okay, settle down.

20:31.721 --> 20:33.165
No, I'm sure that Joey
doesn't want to hear

20:33.189 --> 20:35.088
about your romantic
first meeting with Alice

20:35.124 --> 20:37.325
and our story is not boring.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.526
Why are you being so hostile?

20:38.561 --> 20:40.160
Why are you licking Alice's ass?

20:40.196 --> 20:42.797
So! Bread salad.

20:42.832 --> 20:44.598
Delicious.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.266
Who knew?

20:53.008 --> 20:54.508
You okay?

20:54.544 --> 20:57.110
Um, can you... No. Can
you not touch me, please?

21:02.051 --> 21:04.418
I didn't mean those tweets don't matter.

21:04.454 --> 21:06.453
The why'd you say it?

21:06.488 --> 21:07.887
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:07.922 --> 21:09.033
I'm just trying to support you.

21:09.057 --> 21:10.657
When I met you,

21:10.692 --> 21:12.959
you were swiping left on
dark skinned girls, remember?

21:12.994 --> 21:14.494
I'm not Jamal.

21:14.529 --> 21:16.095
I think I've shown that by now.

21:17.532 --> 21:19.165
I-I wanna help with the protest.

21:21.102 --> 21:23.035
You know, maybe I don't need your help

21:23.071 --> 21:25.037
if you can't fully
understand these issues.

21:25.073 --> 21:27.774
I don't understand? I'm
not woke enough for you?

21:27.809 --> 21:29.542
Honestly, it feels like

21:29.578 --> 21:31.055
you're taking those tweets out on me.

21:31.079 --> 21:33.257
Well, if you can't handle that
then maybe you can't handle me.

21:33.281 --> 21:35.393
Well, how am I supposed to handle
you when you won't let me know how?

21:35.417 --> 21:37.211
I like a strong woman
but there is such a thing

21:37.235 --> 21:38.629
as being independent to a fault.

21:38.653 --> 21:41.453
You don't have to do everything alone.

21:47.695 --> 21:49.027
Malika...

21:49.062 --> 21:50.496
do you even want me around?

21:58.506 --> 21:59.704
Okay.

22:16.443 --> 22:18.396
So... I'm your boyfriend.

22:19.412 --> 22:21.179
I was trying to get us out of this.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.581
Mm. You didn't tell him we're
also meeting up with Jude,

22:23.616 --> 22:25.150
Brandon, and my sister for dinner?

22:25.185 --> 22:26.818
No, I thought Mariana was enough.

22:28.421 --> 22:29.421
Uh-oh.

22:30.490 --> 22:32.224
So, what do you do?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.494
Nothing. Since I dropped out of college,

22:36.545 --> 22:39.313
and wrapped my car around a tree.

22:42.102 --> 22:43.335
What kind of car?

22:43.370 --> 22:44.736
So, um...

22:44.771 --> 22:46.271
Mariana...

22:47.373 --> 22:48.538
need a refill?

22:48.574 --> 22:49.940
Of my sparkling water?

22:49.976 --> 22:52.809
I could use one, if you don't mind.

22:55.147 --> 22:56.313
Oh.

22:57.616 --> 22:58.815
Thanks.

23:00.119 --> 23:01.651
So, uh, you a lawyer too?

23:01.687 --> 23:03.287
I am.

23:03.322 --> 23:04.766
Looked like you could use a refresher.

23:04.790 --> 23:06.257
Thank you.

23:06.292 --> 23:08.332
So Jamie, I know a lot of
the partners in your firm.

23:08.361 --> 23:09.693
How's Eggert Jr. doing?

23:09.728 --> 23:11.862
He's trying to follow in
his father's footsteps.

23:11.898 --> 23:13.330
- That's a good boy.
- Yeah.

23:13.366 --> 23:15.432
His dad and I play golf now and then.

23:15.467 --> 23:16.500
- Do you play?
- I do.

23:16.535 --> 23:18.936
Ah, I'm a member at the club in Toluca.

23:18.971 --> 23:20.504
- Lakeside?
- Yeah.

23:20.539 --> 23:22.638
- Just applied for a membership.
- Ah.

23:22.673 --> 23:24.485
I'd be happy to write a
letter of recommendation.

23:24.509 --> 23:26.509
Yeah, we should play a round sometime.

23:26.544 --> 23:27.743
Absolutely.

23:27.779 --> 23:28.878
What do you shoot?

23:30.949 --> 23:33.482
So is, uh, is Jamie
really her boyfriend?

23:33.518 --> 23:36.386
Uh... no. I don't think so.

23:36.421 --> 23:37.899
- What happened with Gael?
- I don't know.

23:37.923 --> 23:40.589
He's exclusive with Bryan now.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.559
I don't really see
her with Jamie anyway.

23:43.594 --> 23:44.894
I think he's perfectly nice.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.195
I didn't say he wasn't.

23:46.231 --> 23:48.109
They probably have a lot in
common, is what I'm saying.

23:48.133 --> 23:49.799
I was just offering a personal opinion.

23:49.834 --> 23:52.068
Guess I'm not allowed those either.

23:52.103 --> 23:54.237
Okay, seriously, what
is going on with you two?

23:54.272 --> 23:56.705
Nothing.

23:56.741 --> 23:58.240
- Excuse me.
- Mm!

23:58.275 --> 24:00.976
Oh, thank you so much. Delicious.

24:01.011 --> 24:03.111
Lena, I understand you're
running for state assembly.

24:04.148 --> 24:05.481
Yes, yes I am.

24:05.516 --> 24:08.116
Oh, is this your first
foray into politics?

24:08.152 --> 24:10.285
Actually, I'm on the
San Diego school board.

24:10.321 --> 24:13.055
- Curtis has run for state
judge a few times. - Mm-hmm.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.669
I don't know about you, but I
don't miss all the glad-handing.

24:15.693 --> 24:17.526
And it doesn't end
after they're elected.

24:17.562 --> 24:19.829
I appreciate all the
sacrifice you've made for me.

24:19.864 --> 24:22.130
- Like keeping my mouth shut?
- Mm.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.733
Curtis and I don't
agree on all the issues.

24:24.769 --> 24:27.169
I don't see why you should
have to keep your mouth shut.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.838
Voters should understand that
it's the candidate that's running,

24:29.873 --> 24:31.305
not their spouse.

24:31.341 --> 24:33.407
They should understand
that, but they don't.

24:33.443 --> 24:34.443
Unfortunately.

24:42.018 --> 24:43.084
You down?

24:45.655 --> 24:47.088
You think they're still fighting?

24:47.123 --> 24:48.155
Oh, for sure.

24:48.191 --> 24:49.891
They do this on the daily.

24:49.926 --> 24:51.170
We caught the 8:00 p.m. showing.

24:51.194 --> 24:53.561
But they'll be more in
love than ever tomorrow.

24:53.597 --> 24:54.929
I don't know.

24:56.332 --> 24:58.232
I'm over Sumi.

24:58.267 --> 24:59.433
I hope that you can see that.

24:59.469 --> 25:01.235
Yeah, I did...

25:01.270 --> 25:02.336
see that.

25:03.573 --> 25:05.973
I also saw that she's not over you.

25:09.144 --> 25:10.377
What?

25:10.412 --> 25:13.046
That girl is still in love with you.

25:17.452 --> 25:19.386
So you're a country club guy?

25:19.421 --> 25:21.454
Yes. I like golf, okay?

25:21.490 --> 25:22.689
Don't hold that against me.

25:22.725 --> 25:24.958
Yeah.

25:27.496 --> 25:31.532
So, uh... how did you end
up in juvie so many times?

25:34.102 --> 25:35.335
Bad decisions.

25:36.872 --> 25:38.271
Recidivism's a bitch.

25:41.576 --> 25:42.875
It's gone.

25:43.978 --> 25:46.679
They uh... took it off when
they dropped the charges.

25:48.049 --> 25:50.449
Perks of being privileged and all...

25:51.206 --> 25:52.217
Tate.

25:52.253 --> 25:53.953
Can you clear away the food?

25:53.988 --> 25:56.756
Our guests have a dinner
reservation to get to, right?

25:56.791 --> 25:58.691
Yes, we do.

25:58.726 --> 26:00.103
Thank you so much for hosting us.

26:00.127 --> 26:01.360
Oh, our pleasure.

26:01.395 --> 26:02.795
They dropped the charges?

26:02.830 --> 26:04.363
He took a swing at a police officer.

26:04.398 --> 26:05.565
That was lovely.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.310
- Very, very lovely.
- Thank you for coming.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.001
Thank you.

26:11.906 --> 26:14.839
Did the plaintiff's attorney
submit their Batson Challenge?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.908
- Yes, they did.
- And how is it?

26:16.944 --> 26:17.944
Cursory.

26:18.879 --> 26:21.112
Still no proof of any
pattern of discrimination.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.514
I'll send it to you.

26:24.517 --> 26:25.684
Judge for yourself.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.894
All right, you two.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.161
Sit down.

26:38.465 --> 26:40.131
- What?
- You made us do it.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.833
Whatever it is, we can talk it out

26:41.868 --> 26:43.012
and don't say that it's nothing.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.503
You heard the lady. Sit down.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.917
Well, would you like
to start or shall I?

27:04.223 --> 27:06.389
Mom gave an opinion during an interview

27:06.425 --> 27:07.791
that contradicted mine.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.927
And her campaign manager, Cindy...

27:10.696 --> 27:11.829
flipped out.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.164
And your mother did not stand up for me.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.398
That is not true.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.201
I discussed the issue with Cindy.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.771
Yes. You and Cindy. Not you and me.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.572
You discussed it with Cindy.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.175
It's always the two of you...

27:26.011 --> 27:27.644
talking about your political future

27:27.679 --> 27:30.213
which affects our
personal lives, by the way.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.250
And I don't even... I
don't even have a say.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.522
I would never do anything
that affects us without you.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.557
You already are, Lena.

27:40.592 --> 27:43.527
It honestly feels like
she's your partner in this.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.863
Campaigning together
and strategizing together

27:46.898 --> 27:48.931
and I'm just the wife
that's asked to stand by

27:48.967 --> 27:51.268
with her mouth shut if I
ever am asked to stand by

27:51.303 --> 27:54.504
because, "Oh, we certainly
don't want the former cop"

27:54.540 --> 27:56.673
wife to scare off the progressives."

27:56.708 --> 27:58.108
Okay, let's try to fight fair here.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.176
And what is this outfit?

27:59.211 --> 28:00.555
She's asking you to straighten your hair

28:00.579 --> 28:02.011
and wear these suits. You look...

28:03.114 --> 28:04.246
Who are you?

28:04.282 --> 28:06.248
That's definitely not fighting fair.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.525
Run for office, I want you to, I do.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.829
Run for president for all I care.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.698
You can do it with Cindy.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.599
She can be your partner
because I am out.

28:29.006 --> 28:30.638
Okay, that works so much better

28:30.674 --> 28:32.174
when you two play the parents.

28:50.531 --> 28:52.031
I'm really sorry.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.501
I didn't realize you felt so
cut off from this campaign.

28:56.537 --> 28:59.872
It's not the campaign, Lena.
I feel cut off from you.

29:01.575 --> 29:03.241
Do you wanna be my campaign manager?

29:04.168 --> 29:06.134
- Uh, no.
- No, I'm serious.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.603
I don't know the first thing
about running a campaign.

29:13.743 --> 29:16.611
Sometimes I say the wrong things.

29:16.646 --> 29:20.481
And I'm probably going
to continue to do so.

29:22.452 --> 29:23.885
I'm sorry.

29:25.789 --> 29:27.989
You have a right to your own opinion.

29:28.992 --> 29:31.059
And you are the one
who encouraged me to...

29:31.094 --> 29:33.461
to stay in this race and to be myself.

29:33.496 --> 29:35.831
So I can't ask you not to do the same.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.567
If you win this, and I...

29:39.602 --> 29:41.702
I want you to so very much,

29:41.737 --> 29:45.005
you're gonna be spending a
lot of time in Sacramento.

29:45.041 --> 29:47.141
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time apart.

29:47.176 --> 29:50.010
For the first time, and we...

29:52.081 --> 29:54.581
We have to be stronger
than ever to stay connected.

29:54.616 --> 29:56.250
I know.

30:01.157 --> 30:04.558
Aww. You guys made up?

30:04.593 --> 30:05.993
Yeah.

30:07.429 --> 30:09.063
Come here, Miss Thang.

30:10.499 --> 30:11.966
Thanks for trying.

30:12.001 --> 30:13.567
It sucked.

30:14.870 --> 30:17.804
You know, I've been thinking about
that spreadsheet you told us about

30:17.840 --> 30:19.439
and the race column.

30:19.475 --> 30:21.408
And I think you need
to be true to yourself.

30:21.443 --> 30:23.555
It's not fair for you to
fight for all those other women

30:23.579 --> 30:25.311
if they're not willing to fight for you.

30:26.448 --> 30:28.014
Yeah, but...

30:28.049 --> 30:30.216
how do I convince them?

30:30.252 --> 30:31.496
Mariana, when you want something,

30:31.520 --> 30:32.731
there's no one more convincing.

30:32.755 --> 30:34.821
- I mean, you're not wrong.
- Mm.

30:34.857 --> 30:36.222
I should have been the lawyer.

30:36.258 --> 30:37.791
Heard that.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.660
What are we talking about?

30:41.930 --> 30:44.130
Um, fighting for what you believe in.

30:44.165 --> 30:46.099
And for the people that you believe in.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.268
- Including yourself.
- Mmm.

30:48.303 --> 30:50.370
I love it when you come to visit.

30:50.405 --> 30:52.005
Me too.

31:11.726 --> 31:13.393
Mm.

31:29.843 --> 31:31.910
Come in.

31:35.816 --> 31:37.649
What's all this?

31:37.684 --> 31:40.953
Self care. In a form that I can afford.

31:42.389 --> 31:44.056
And why you always coming to my room

31:44.091 --> 31:45.451
and standing in the door? Come in.

31:46.393 --> 31:47.892
You can sit down.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.866
So...

31:54.901 --> 31:58.069
how are you feeling about Jamal?

32:00.139 --> 32:04.709
Well, what Jamal said
isn't anything new.

32:04.744 --> 32:07.144
It's not anything I
didn't think about myself

32:07.180 --> 32:09.714
when I was a kid.

32:09.749 --> 32:12.316
You don't know what
it's like to be a kid

32:12.352 --> 32:16.020
and not see yourself on TV or in books.

32:17.290 --> 32:19.156
And...

32:19.192 --> 32:23.728
The little I did see,
uh, it took me a long time

32:23.763 --> 32:26.130
to see myself as worthy or valuable.

32:28.201 --> 32:29.566
Jamal never got there.

32:31.269 --> 32:34.137
He hated black women
because he hated himself.

32:35.307 --> 32:38.341
- Aren't you mad?
- Yeah, I'm always mad,

32:38.377 --> 32:40.677
and I'm always disappointed,

32:40.713 --> 32:43.413
and tired and frustrated.

32:43.448 --> 32:47.784
And I wish I didn't have
to organize a protest

32:47.820 --> 32:52.523
for someone who can't see the
beauty in his own people but...

32:52.558 --> 32:55.358
I have to. I have to
be there for everyone

32:55.394 --> 32:58.562
because we all should
be the for each other.

33:04.102 --> 33:05.601
Who's there for you?

33:22.154 --> 33:23.353
You're here.

33:24.756 --> 33:26.556
Thought maybe I scared
you off the other day.

33:28.060 --> 33:31.127
I'm really sorry for how I reacted.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.397
I mean, what Jamal
said was not your fault.

33:34.433 --> 33:37.466
And we all have our moments, right?

33:37.501 --> 33:39.401
I mean, last night...

33:39.437 --> 33:41.103
I broke up with my...

33:41.138 --> 33:43.072
We can't afford to have our moments.

33:43.107 --> 33:45.474
We have an uphill battle to fight.

33:45.509 --> 33:48.544
Not just for Jamal, but for all of us.

33:53.952 --> 33:55.117
Okay.

33:57.889 --> 33:59.221
Let's go to court.

34:02.660 --> 34:03.968
I called this impromptu meeting

34:03.992 --> 34:05.757
to readdress the racial pay gap.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.260
I thought we decided
one issue at a time.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.661
But they're not separate issues,

34:09.697 --> 34:11.496
they're intersectional.

34:11.532 --> 34:13.466
Look, we can't say that
we're fighting for women

34:13.501 --> 34:14.777
when we're leaving those among us

34:14.801 --> 34:16.333
who are struggling the most behind.

34:16.370 --> 34:18.103
Which is women of color.

34:20.139 --> 34:23.440
Over time, the wage gap
gets worse for women like me.

34:23.476 --> 34:25.243
And if you do get that raise,

34:25.277 --> 34:27.844
it's based on the initial lower salary.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.681
So, in 10 years, I
will have lost around...

34:30.717 --> 34:33.885
$82,000, say compared to Claire.

34:35.022 --> 34:38.322
And in 20 years, I
will have lost 164,000.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.925
True, the average white guy engineer

34:40.960 --> 34:44.396
will have made roughly half a
mill more than me by then, but...

34:45.164 --> 34:47.998
the average white woman will
have left me behind as well.

34:48.034 --> 34:49.867
And that's not right.

34:51.404 --> 34:53.103
Guess I never thought
about it like that.

34:54.306 --> 34:55.973
- I'm in.
- Same.

34:57.209 --> 35:00.511
Great. Well, impromptu
meeting adjourned.

35:06.786 --> 35:09.787
You know we're the only women
of color engineers, right?

35:09.822 --> 35:12.222
So if we check that race box,

35:12.258 --> 35:14.124
there goes our anonymity.

35:23.269 --> 35:24.269
What's that?

35:26.872 --> 35:28.638
My Batson argument.

35:28.674 --> 35:31.975
I spent the weekend combing through
all the voir dire transcripts,

35:32.010 --> 35:34.644
and I believe I clearly proved
a pattern of discrimination

35:34.680 --> 35:35.879
based on racial bias

35:35.914 --> 35:38.115
by tracking the amount
of times that white jurors

35:38.150 --> 35:39.916
who gave the same
answers as black jurors

35:39.952 --> 35:42.086
were seated, when the
black jurors were dismissed.

35:42.121 --> 35:43.187
You proved?

35:44.457 --> 35:46.957
Jamal's attorney's may not
have the time or resources...

35:46.992 --> 35:48.525
But you do?

35:48.561 --> 35:49.826
Judges do their own research.

35:49.861 --> 35:51.261
It's not our job to litigate.

35:53.165 --> 35:54.998
Our job is to interpret the law

35:55.033 --> 35:56.733
based on the facts and evidence.

35:56.768 --> 35:58.101
You crossed a line.

35:58.136 --> 35:59.669
Maybe lines need to be crossed

35:59.705 --> 36:02.038
if justice is going
to be served equally.

36:03.675 --> 36:06.042
If your son was black
and tried to punch a cop,

36:06.078 --> 36:08.244
do you think that he
would be alive today?

36:08.279 --> 36:09.719
Would his charges have been dropped?

36:12.250 --> 36:14.250
You need to get back to work

36:14.285 --> 36:16.820
doing the job that you have
been given the honor of doing.

36:28.399 --> 36:30.699
So, as the only woman of color

36:30.735 --> 36:32.201
checking this box,

36:32.237 --> 36:33.736
I'm pretty much outing myself

36:33.771 --> 36:36.172
if Angela or anyone else
gets their hands on it.

36:38.543 --> 36:39.609
Give me that.

36:41.812 --> 36:44.213
Pretty sure I'm the only
Indian guy who works here.

36:52.823 --> 36:54.190
Hey.

36:54.225 --> 36:55.891
We have a staff meeting.

36:59.997 --> 37:02.331
So if that's all the
housekeeping we've got...

37:02.367 --> 37:03.866
Uh, I have an announcement.

37:03.901 --> 37:04.901
Yeah.

37:05.602 --> 37:07.435
Due to his excellent leadership,

37:07.471 --> 37:10.305
Josh is going to pitch
the new app to investors

37:10.340 --> 37:11.640
for the first time.

37:12.743 --> 37:13.876
- Come on!
- Woo-hoo!

37:13.911 --> 37:15.277
Josh, Josh...

37:15.312 --> 37:17.512
Don't worry guys, I plan on crushing it.

37:18.482 --> 37:20.315
Uh, hey. Before we break,

37:20.350 --> 37:23.585
we're dealing with a glitch similar
to the one that Team Blue reported.

37:23.620 --> 37:24.987
Can they share their solution?

37:25.022 --> 37:27.455
Actually, I believe you
cracked that Alex, right?

37:28.559 --> 37:30.225
Yeah, let me check my notes.

37:31.195 --> 37:33.162
And we'll uh... circle back.

37:33.197 --> 37:35.262
Actually, you know,
when I flagged the issue,

37:35.298 --> 37:37.699
my solve was to store
user's state locally

37:37.734 --> 37:40.434
and update the instant state
whenever they leave the app.

37:40.469 --> 37:42.737
If the user is online, I update the DB

37:42.772 --> 37:45.039
with the current GIF draft and...

37:45.075 --> 37:46.515
start there whenever they come back.

37:47.276 --> 37:48.409
Good job.

37:49.045 --> 37:50.277
Okay, then...

37:50.313 --> 37:51.846
Meeting adjourned.

37:51.881 --> 37:53.380
Mariana, can you stay?

37:53.416 --> 37:55.983
Angela, Josh, you too.

38:02.658 --> 38:05.459
I'm confused about something.

38:06.329 --> 38:08.596
Mariana, you seem to be very motivated.

38:08.631 --> 38:12.333
So when I agreed to
hear your new app pitch,

38:12.368 --> 38:14.000
why didn't you follow up?

38:15.771 --> 38:17.204
Well, um...

38:17.240 --> 38:18.572
Angela was...

38:18.608 --> 38:20.107
correct to point out that I should be

38:20.142 --> 38:21.475
more respectful of your time.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.876
Who told you to point that out?

38:24.347 --> 38:26.313
I, uh, was...

38:26.349 --> 38:28.415
told to give Mariana a heads up

38:28.451 --> 38:30.951
about protocol by Josh.

38:32.722 --> 38:34.488
- I see.
- Okay, look,

38:34.523 --> 38:37.491
if every employee that
wanted to pitch you an app

38:37.526 --> 38:39.671
- got a meeting, that's all you'd do.
- That's my call.

38:39.695 --> 38:41.262
This is my company.

38:41.297 --> 38:42.696
Yes.

38:42.732 --> 38:46.332
Mariana, my assistant will set
up an appointment for next week.

38:46.368 --> 38:47.734
I will hear your pitch.

38:49.170 --> 38:50.570
Okay. Thank you.

38:54.809 --> 38:57.977
Angela, do not admonish
employees who want access to me.

38:58.012 --> 38:59.279
And Josh...

39:00.382 --> 39:01.982
I've decided to pitch
the new app myself.

39:19.668 --> 39:22.334
Concerning the plaintiff's
Batson Challenge,

39:22.369 --> 39:24.336
I've read the written arguments

39:24.371 --> 39:26.371
and see no proof of discrimination.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.040
Challenge denied.

39:32.814 --> 39:34.213
However...

39:35.449 --> 39:38.217
I would like to take
this moment to rebuke

39:38.252 --> 39:40.853
the defense's questioning

39:40.888 --> 39:42.988
and striking of black jurors.

39:44.258 --> 39:47.793
If this persists, I will
reconsider my ruling.

39:49.363 --> 39:50.629
Yes, Your Honor.

39:50.664 --> 39:52.531
We're prepared to seat this jury as is.

40:03.310 --> 40:04.643
I can ask you?

40:04.678 --> 40:07.011
- Yeah, you can ask me.
- Okay. Okay.

40:07.047 --> 40:09.247
Hey.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.282
Hey.

40:11.652 --> 40:13.885
Looks like we'll be clerking together.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.821
- Judge Wilson hired you?
- Yeah.

40:15.856 --> 40:17.121
Thank you.

40:17.157 --> 40:18.623
I-I know it was all you.

40:19.693 --> 40:21.292
Callie.

40:21.328 --> 40:22.661
Can I speak with you?

40:22.696 --> 40:23.795
Yeah.

40:34.207 --> 40:36.908
Thank you so much for hiring Kate.

40:36.943 --> 40:39.310
Oh, it's the... It's
the right thing to do.

40:39.346 --> 40:40.778
It's an easy decision.

40:41.848 --> 40:43.781
Unlike the one that
I'm about to tell you.

40:46.586 --> 40:48.386
You're off the Jamal Thompson case.

40:54.593 --> 40:56.693
You've lost your sense of objectivity.

40:56.728 --> 40:59.329
My keeping you on would be reckless.

40:59.365 --> 41:00.964
I'm sorry.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.934
Kate will be replacing you...

41:04.870 --> 41:06.203
in the case.

41:07.172 --> 41:08.471
I hope you understand.
