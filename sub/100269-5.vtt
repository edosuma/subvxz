WEBVTT

00:20.103 --> 00:22.522
I cannot believe
there are no charging stations.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.025
Fucking Arizona.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.070
Well, we could call a tow,

00:29.154 --> 00:32.198
but, uh, you know, what the fuck,
it's gonna take way too long.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.867
Let's just take the PJ.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.994
I know jets are wasteful,

00:36.077 --> 00:38.079
but I don't want you driving
through the night,

00:38.163 --> 00:39.247
and my mom...

00:39.748 --> 00:41.458
really hates it when people are late.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.127
God, I cannot wait for you to meet her.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.506
-What time is Love getting there?
-Who knows?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.884
She's on her new boyfriend's dick
like herpes.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.552
Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but--

00:52.635 --> 00:54.804
Will, right? She's bringing him?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.014
Yep.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.185
<i> Move, Joe.</i>

01:00.643 --> 01:01.936
Wait, stop! Stop!

01:02.228 --> 01:03.313
Stop, Candace.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.314
I love you.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.523
Just let me go.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.983
Tell me you don't love me.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.736
I don't! I don't love you.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.321
I never have.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.199
What are you gonna do about it, Joe?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.117
Don't do this!

01:16.785 --> 01:17.660
Stop!

01:26.419 --> 01:29.839
Looks like it's gonna be
a proper meet-the-parents Wellkend.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.549
Oh!

01:31.633 --> 01:32.592
Hi. Yeah.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.010
Forty Quinn here.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.304
Yes, like the number, but spelled out.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.098
F-O...

01:49.359 --> 01:52.737
<i> I now truly understand</i>
<i>the term "love of my life."</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:55.865
<i>My life makes sense now with you in it.</i>

01:56.241 --> 01:58.827
<i>Complete. Not closed.</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:02.789
<i>More open to the world</i>
<i>and everything beautiful than ever before.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:04.958
<i>Nothing to hide.</i>

02:05.333 --> 02:07.210
<i>You've asked me to meet the parents.</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:08.920
<i>Might be messy, family can be.</i>

02:09.003 --> 02:11.714
<i>But whatever comes,</i>
<i>we'll get through it, together.</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:16.136
I don't wanna.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263
Can your parents really be that bad?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.932
Worse. They can be worse.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.101
Okay, remember,

02:23.184 --> 02:25.770
they charm so that they can manipulate.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.897
My mom is a lot.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.649
Just give in to her crazy.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.693
And my dad is impenetrable.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.528
Just don't take it personally.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.071
Try not to.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.239
I still do.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.491
Is there anything I can do to support you?

02:39.409 --> 02:40.410
We could have a signal.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.828
Like...

02:42.787 --> 02:45.248
What is that? Are... Are you Spider-Man?

02:45.331 --> 02:47.667
No, no.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.460
Um, it's-- it's, uh...

02:50.128 --> 02:51.713
ASL for "I love you."

02:52.255 --> 02:55.884
In, like, a friendly
you know, like, platonic way.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.011
<i> I love you.</i>

02:58.803 --> 03:00.555
<i>In the non-friendly way,</i>

03:01.097 --> 03:03.099
<i>but I'm waiting to say it.</i>

03:03.183 --> 03:04.934
<i>Why rush when we have</i>
<i>the rest of our lives?</i>

03:05.894 --> 03:07.020
Hmm!

03:08.354 --> 03:09.606
My dad's gonna like that shirt.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.566
<i> I know. I do my research.</i>

03:12.275 --> 03:15.820
<i>America's surrogate dream parents,</i>
<i>Ray and Dottie Quinn.</i>

03:16.196 --> 03:17.864
<i>Ray is a Pasadena golden boy</i>

03:17.947 --> 03:19.449
<i>who comes from old-school money.</i>

03:19.532 --> 03:22.327
<i>Dottie is the spark plug</i>
<i>that gives him life.</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:24.370
<i>They met in the naked hot tubs</i>
<i>at Esalen, </i>

03:24.454 --> 03:25.705
<i>eloped shortly thereafter.</i>

03:25.788 --> 03:28.166
<i>Joan Baez is rumored to have officiated.</i>

03:28.917 --> 03:32.295
<i>Dottie opened Anavrin</i>
<i>with Ray's family cash.</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:34.505
<i>What started as a pet project has evolved</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:37.175
<i>into a global brand largely due to Dottie,</i>

03:37.842 --> 03:40.720
<i>all centered on the Quinn family motto,</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:42.889
<i>"Transparency and realness."</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:45.642
<i>This weekend is Ray and Dottie's</i>
<i>30th anniversary,</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:47.518
<i>and they're making up</i>
<i>for their quickie wedding</i>

03:47.602 --> 03:49.145
<i>with a wellness bacchanal.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
<i>Ray and Dottie's vow renewal</i>
<i>will be the culmination</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:53.107
<i>of packed community--</i>
<i>say it with me now--</i>

03:53.358 --> 03:54.359
<i>"Wellkend."</i>

03:54.442 --> 03:56.444
<i>Shoot me in the face.</i>

03:56.527 --> 03:58.029
<i>But whatever you need, Love.</i>

03:58.112 --> 04:01.866
<i>These people may pretend to be real,</i>
<i>but you and I really are.</i>

04:04.118 --> 04:06.204
-<i> Speaking of messy family...</i>
-Hey.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.457
<i>Did you know Ja Rule</i>
<i>and Ashanti never banged?</i>

04:09.540 --> 04:10.625
Okay. And?

04:10.708 --> 04:13.920
I don't know, it just kind of ruins it
for me knowing their love was never real.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.422
Can you check out?
It fucks up inventory when you steal.

04:17.340 --> 04:20.426
-Is that kombucha?
<i>-Stop being so codependent, okay?</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:24.430
'Buch has about as much alcohol in it
as fresh-pressed juice,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.599
and I want to pour one out for Henderson.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.851
Because it was our thing.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.854
<i> Did you hear they're saying</i>
<i>it was a suicide now?</i>

04:32.939 --> 04:34.440
<i>Too good for this world.</i>

04:35.358 --> 04:38.152
<i> Another melancholy clown</i>
<i>dies by his own hand,</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:40.613
<i>and his adoring fans</i>
<i>and acquaintances grieve deeply</i>

04:40.697 --> 04:43.074
<i>for, oh, about the next one</i>
<i>to two news cycles.</i>

04:43.866 --> 04:45.368
Are you making it to meetings?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.203
I'm in such a positive place right now

04:47.287 --> 04:49.998
and AA is a breeding ground of negativity.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.708
Speaking of circle jerks,

04:51.791 --> 04:53.710
<i>you still coming to Mom and Dad's</i>
<i>Wank-end?</i>

04:53.793 --> 04:55.128
Yes, of course.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.506
Forty, just promise me
that you won't do anything--

04:58.589 --> 04:59.966
Gotta go. Amy's in the whip.

05:04.762 --> 05:05.930
Is everything okay?

05:06.014 --> 05:06.931
Yeah.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.686
No.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.605
Forty's gonna go off the rails again.
I can tell.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.399
It's gonna be bad.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.359
You like the girl he just met, right?

05:20.403 --> 05:21.321
Sure.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.364
We went to the movies.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.283
We didn't even talk.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.286
What can I say? He's on pattern.

05:28.369 --> 05:32.123
Meets a girl, each a new
impossible-to-predict type of bad for him,

05:32.206 --> 05:34.625
and then he tries
to get our parents to like her,

05:34.709 --> 05:36.878
then he flings himself off a cliff
when they don't.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.713
<i> Leaving you to clean the splatter.</i>

05:38.921 --> 05:40.256
I can neutralize.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.884
I can distract. I'm good with parents.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.636
We got this.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.765
Sure, I could tell you
were my sister is, but...

05:48.848 --> 05:49.891
what is this about?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.684
It's about Joshua Bunter.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.394
-You might know him as...
- <i>Henderson.</i>

05:53.478 --> 05:55.646
<i>Clearly, I need to be</i>
<i>in two places at once,</i>

05:55.730 --> 05:57.106
<i>with you and near Ellie.</i>

05:57.190 --> 05:58.274
Just crossing the T's here.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.361
We know from Henderson's IMs he was
planning on seeing your sister that night.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.238
Yeah, I don't read the news.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.699
It's, like, so depressing,
but I-- I thought he...

06:07.825 --> 06:08.701
offed himself.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.411
<i> Delilah's smarter than these guys.</i>

06:10.495 --> 06:12.330
Yeah, well, it seems that way.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.750
<i> And I've got parental tech</i>
<i>to keep an eye on Ellie</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:18.836
<i>and the fallout</i>
<i>from Hendy's tragic suicide.</i>

06:18.920 --> 06:20.296
Well, Ellie's not home right now,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.549
but I can call you when she is
if you want, or, like...

06:23.633 --> 06:26.177
Oh, no. I have to go into work.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.387
I'm sorry.

06:27.845 --> 06:28.679
Bye.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.606
Were you at Henderson's
the night he died, Ellie?

06:39.649 --> 06:40.525
What are these?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.863
-What do you think they are?
-Don't evade with a question.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.865
-You evaded with a question first!
-Jesus!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.617
Half the time you treat me like an adult,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.870
but, wait, suddenly, I'm a kid because
you can't get it together to be an adult?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.122
You really wanna know?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.251
Those are Henderson's.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.671
No, they're not.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.840
They're random.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.967
They're... He's not even in 'em.
They're just...

07:06.050 --> 07:07.051
I know...

07:09.762 --> 07:11.139
because he did it to me.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.394
I don't believe you.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.482
-Where's your photo then?
-You don't believe me? You need proof?

07:22.984 --> 07:26.612
Listen, don't get mad at me because
he was a bad guy and you fell for it.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.989
He was my friend!

07:28.072 --> 07:30.116
He wasn't your friend, Ellie!
Let me guess.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.077
He made you promise not to tell anyone
you were hanging out alone together?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.162
Basic predator move.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.247
You are a lot of things...

07:36.747 --> 07:38.207
but you're not stupid.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.195
Ah, ooh, ooh! Hi.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.946
-Hello.
-Hi, babe.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.073
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you guys are here.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.158
Oh, my God.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.702
-How are you?
-I'm good.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.953
Yeah, this is great.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.289
<i> Well, thankfully,</i>
<i>teenagers text emotional gibberish,</i>

08:18.372 --> 08:19.832
<i>so I know Ellie's okay.</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:21.584
All right, put the phone away.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.378
Welcome to the Hellmouth.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.715
<i> And I'm in a Wes Anderson movie</i>

08:27.798 --> 08:30.051
<i>set in a weirdly Caucasian ashram.</i>

08:30.676 --> 08:31.969
-Hey, Dad.
-Lovey, hey.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.012
Hey.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.347
This is Will Bettelheim.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.140
Oh. You related to Bruno?

08:36.224 --> 08:38.142
<i> Ray's a not-so-secret fantasy fan.</i>

08:38.226 --> 08:40.061
<i>He's referring to Bruno Bettelheim,</i>
<i>author of...</i>

08:40.144 --> 08:42.063
<i>The Uses of Enchantment </i>is a classic.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.107
No relation, I'm just a fan.
It's good to meet you, Mr. Quinn.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.817
Call me Ray.

08:47.109 --> 08:47.944
Will?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.655
Finally we meet.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.156
Oh!

08:52.448 --> 08:53.908
You are delicious.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.409
The pleasure is all mine, Dottie.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.203
Come here, darling. You look beautiful.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.288
-Hey, Mom.
-I'm sorry, I'm all over the place.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.249
-Let's get you a drink.
-Okay.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.293
Sounds good.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.007
-Forty.
-Sport! Hi, Love.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.801
Where'd she go? There she is.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.427
You gotta meet my girl, Amy.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.804
Amy, come here.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.729
Hi there.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.274
Will Bettelheim,

09:26.357 --> 09:27.275
Amy Adam.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.110
Nice to meet you.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.236
<i> It can't be.</i>

09:30.319 --> 09:31.946
<i>Am I hallucinating?</i>

09:32.488 --> 09:34.407
<i>This is her hand, this is real.</i>

09:34.490 --> 09:35.491
<i>Candace is here.</i>

09:35.575 --> 09:36.492
Will Bettelheim...

09:36.576 --> 09:38.035
What a great name.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.704
Almost sounds made up.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.290
<i> Is she trying to spar with me?</i>

09:42.373 --> 09:44.458
That's funny, I was just thinking,
"Amy Adam."

09:44.542 --> 09:46.460
How totally un-google-able.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.965
<i> This is a game to her.</i>
<i>She's enjoying this.</i>

09:51.048 --> 09:52.425
I'm so happy to see you again.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.552
<i> She's crazy, Love.</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:56.846
I'm also so hungry
I could eat my own hand, so let's--

09:56.929 --> 09:59.557
-Oh, no, don't worry. Just eat mine.
-Oh!

09:59.682 --> 10:02.143
<i> Like the kids say, "Fuck my life."</i>

10:15.531 --> 10:16.991
Oh, good, you're awake.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.327
-Shh-sh-sh-sh.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.454
It's okay, you are totally safe.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.914
I have a surprise for you.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.255
Can you promise to be calm?

10:32.798 --> 10:34.175
Okay, good.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.013
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said. I'm an idiot.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.681
Okay, I'm stupid. Let's just go home.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.225
You're just saying that
because you think it's what I wanna hear.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.977
No, I'm saying that

10:45.061 --> 10:47.605
because I'm tied up in the back of a van.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.856
I had to...

10:49.273 --> 10:50.608
so we could get here...

10:51.025 --> 10:52.068
to talk.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.277
I am so sorry.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.907
-But it's all gonna be worth it.
-Where are we?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.408
Lake Mahopac.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.329
You remember that amazing picnic we had?
I brought all your faves again.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.414
No, just, okay...

11:05.498 --> 11:07.625
I know-- I know you don't want to hurt me.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.794
-I would never hurt you.
-Just untie me. Untie me.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.879
I can't do that yet, you know I can't.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.631
Just hang on.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.767
Thanks. Thank you.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.064
Candace!

11:40.866 --> 11:42.868
Listen, you don't understand.
Don't do this!

11:42.952 --> 11:45.371
Stop! Please, don't do this!
Shh! Sh-sh-sh-sh!

11:45.538 --> 11:46.372
Stop...

11:46.455 --> 11:47.373
-Stop!

12:04.515 --> 12:05.474
<i> How?</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:07.435
<i>How did she manage this?</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:10.062
So tell, tell! How you two met.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.313
We're dying to hear.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.232
- Yeah, tell us.
- Well, we were at--

12:13.315 --> 12:14.900
- South By.
-Yeah, and...

12:15.359 --> 12:18.529
-Amy was giving me stalker eyes.
-I was interested, but so was he.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.031
-So she reached for the <i>queso.</i>
-Oh, the <i>queso!</i>

12:21.490 --> 12:23.451
-And, um, it felt like...
-It was fate.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.035
Inseparable ever since.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.787
<i> Enjoy it while it lasts.</i>

12:26.871 --> 12:29.290
Yeah, we actually road-tripped
back from Austin.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.250
Got to know each other
a little bit better.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.210
-And what are you doing?

12:33.294 --> 12:35.629
-Amy is an indie film producer.
-<i> Oh, come on.</i>

12:35.713 --> 12:37.798
we're actually already in soft prep

12:37.882 --> 12:39.925
for a film we're trying to get going.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.218
Honey?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.518
He could pretend to care,
like, if he wanted to.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.272
Wow, these waiters are so slow!

12:53.355 --> 12:55.900
Oh, you want a drink?
I'll-- I'll grab you a drink, bunny.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.735
Yeah, could I get a 'buch, please?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.988
-Virgin, obviously.
- Yes.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.281
Appreciate you.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.328
- Here you go.
-Thanks.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.081
What are you doing here?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.751
I told you I'd show up
to give you what you deserve.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.919
So here we are.

13:15.669 --> 13:16.962
Merry Christmas.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.050
<i> How do I get this time bomb</i>
<i>away from you, Love?</i>

13:21.133 --> 13:23.344
-Want to know how I found you?
-I would love to hear.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.600
So, I was feeling like shit
one fine afternoon,

13:29.683 --> 13:32.686
when I saw this clickbait
about how the stars live.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.563
I mean, who doesn't need
a little escapism?

13:34.855 --> 13:36.273
So I clicked and there was this link

13:36.357 --> 13:38.359
about how all the cool kids
go to Henderson's house,

13:38.442 --> 13:40.194
and although
I wasn't familiar with his work,

13:40.277 --> 13:42.655
I was curious about this random douchebag

13:42.738 --> 13:44.824
high as balls on his coffee table,

13:44.907 --> 13:48.536
which is when I first set eyes
on my new dreamy <i>beau.</i>

13:49.078 --> 13:51.997
<i> Of course, your brother</i>
<i>destroyed my life,</i>

13:52.081 --> 13:53.290
<i>our life.</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:55.417
And he's such an idiot.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.670
And I keep watching and...

13:59.630 --> 14:00.631
No.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.800
Couldn't be.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.719
Could not be.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.763
<i> I was trying to help you, Love.</i>

14:07.847 --> 14:09.598
<i>Altruism is dangerous.</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:11.058
Shocked you'd choose LA.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.184
But I found you.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.811
Great.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.437
What's the move?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.857
You gonna tell them this dramatic tale?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.693
I mean, it is their special weekend,

14:20.776 --> 14:23.279
so I'll wait if and when I have to,

14:23.362 --> 14:27.783
But in the meantime, I am going
to protect them from you, bunny.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.743
Especially...

14:31.328 --> 14:32.538
your gorgeous girl.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.623
Lucky man, Will.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.876
-I missed you, babe.
-Aw!

14:40.379 --> 14:43.007
Yeah, we can, uh,
situate ourselves for dinner.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.305
The fuck?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.100
I didn't know you bite your nails.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.146
I don't.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.023
Not since I was a kid.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.108
Well, what, is meeting my parents
making you nervous?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
'Cause I don't care what they think.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.195
And now I have to do this vow renewal.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.282
I cannot believe
I have to call my parents "lovers."

15:08.741 --> 15:09.575
Then don't.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.536
-Do you.
-No, I can't. My mom gave me a script.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.079
I mean, she said, "Make it your own,"

15:14.163 --> 15:16.540
but I'm pretty sure
that means, "Don't change anything."

15:16.624 --> 15:18.208
Do you want some space to work?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.668
I can go to Forty's yurt.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.506
Yeah, actually. I mean, if you don't mind.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.591
No.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.052
The kombucha thing
is not a good sign. I just...

15:28.344 --> 15:30.137
-I know, I get it.
-Okay.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.680
Don't get lost out there.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.274
<i> I will help you, helicopter sibling.</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:46.278
<i>I need to keep eyes on Candace</i>
<i>so I can protect you from her,</i>

15:46.820 --> 15:47.738
<i>but...</i>

15:47.821 --> 15:50.866
<i>lest I accidentally stumble</i>
<i>into Jeff Bezos' lodge,</i>

15:50.950 --> 15:53.452
<i>I need the blessed yurt map.</i>

15:54.370 --> 15:55.287
Will?

15:56.580 --> 15:57.706
Everything okay?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.833
It's perfect. Thank you.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.837
I just, you know,
wanted to check out the Truth Yurt.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.923
- I was also looking for--
-Care to partake?

16:08.133 --> 16:11.053
-I don't really--
-I insist you be here now.

16:14.014 --> 16:14.848
Okay.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.403
<i> It's fine. I won't inhale.</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:28.612
Now inhale.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.246
So, fresh in from New York, huh?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.164
-Yeah.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.750
I remember being in New York
when I was a kid.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.044
Ah, to be young.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.838
Oh, you're still young.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.548
Tell that to my vagina.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.049
No one warns you.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.635
You wake up one day drier than the Sahara.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.263
If it weren't for this wonder lube
we've developed,

16:54.346 --> 16:55.514
I don't know what I'd do.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.143
It's already so difficult
to reach orgasm at this age.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.436
<i> Is this really happening?</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:02.604
Anyways,
it seems like you understand, Will.

17:04.106 --> 17:04.940
What a chin.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.694
<i> She's not flirting,</i>
<i>she's testing me.</i>

17:08.777 --> 17:11.363
<i>I'm drugged. She hopes it's truth serum.</i>

17:15.617 --> 17:18.704
I think your daughter
is the most amazing woman...

17:19.413 --> 17:20.247
I've ever met.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.464
I like you for Love.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.634
<i> Between the obstacle course</i>
<i>that is Dottie,</i>

17:32.968 --> 17:34.386
<i>and the more fundamental issue,</i>

17:34.470 --> 17:37.973
<i>that every millisecond</i>
<i>of this Wellkend is scheduled,</i>

17:38.057 --> 17:40.267
<i>how do I get Candace alone?</i>

17:40.350 --> 17:41.518
<i>How do I do this, Love?</i>

17:41.602 --> 17:43.020
<i>How do I get her away from you?</i>

17:43.812 --> 17:47.024
Let the wolf awaken<i> </i>your unconscious.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.317
Meet your id.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.659
Hey.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.175
<i> On the plus side,</i>
<i>she's striking out with the Quinns.</i>

18:13.717 --> 18:15.969
Schadenfreude is karmic suicide.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.607
Dad, do you actually...
Do you have a minute?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.943
Not now, son,
I've got doubles with Bozzi from the Palm.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.404
Right. Sorry, Bozz.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.948
-Let's go, Bozz.

18:37.950 --> 18:38.784
Shit.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.494
It's okay.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.664
Forty always...

18:44.123 --> 18:47.042
you know, tries to impress our parents
with these girls.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.670
Can you just help?

19:09.731 --> 19:12.943
<i> Ali Wong's in studio</i>
<i>to talk about Henderson,</i>

19:13.026 --> 19:15.028
<i>or as she knew him, Josh.</i>

19:32.129 --> 19:36.633
I will make a film that premieres
Sundance 2020 at the Eccles.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.177
Friday night slot.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.220
Then goes on to sweep the Gothams,

19:40.304 --> 19:44.308
winning two, no,
three Indie Spirit awards.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.851
Fuck the Oscars.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.566
I hear and accept you, Forty.

19:54.985 --> 19:55.986
Is this gonna work?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.280
'Cause my car is really old.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.616
Yeah, that shiny, new Prius is all yours.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.784
All you need is a group hug and 35K.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.040
I...

20:08.832 --> 20:10.626
will find the perfect partner.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.255
That's good.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.134
We hear and accept you, Gabe.

20:19.843 --> 20:23.805
I will fulfill my life-long dream...

20:25.641 --> 20:28.268
of... traveling to Italy.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.063
<i> Italy?</i>

20:31.605 --> 20:32.439
<i>Seriously?</i>

20:33.357 --> 20:35.192
<i>She is obsessed with me.</i>

20:37.527 --> 20:39.863
Okay, come on,
somebody needs to help her. Go.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.617
- I accept you.
- I accept you.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.534
I hear...

20:46.912 --> 20:48.038
and I accept you...

20:48.705 --> 20:49.539
Amy.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.924
You-- sorry um...

20:59.007 --> 21:00.801
I'm not feeling well.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.345
-I-- I think I'm just dehydrated.
- It's okay.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.347
Don't fear love.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.015
Hug.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.468
I'm-- I'm sorry,
I-- I just need to lie down.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.610
Don't... try... anything.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.697
I am texting someone
on the outside every hour.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.157
You hurt me or the Quinns,

22:05.490 --> 22:07.326
I reveal your identity to everyone,

22:07.409 --> 22:10.078
and <i>everything</i> to get turned over
to the authorities.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.080
Are you crazy?
I'm just trying to talk to you.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.499
Oh, you mean like the time
you left me for <i>fucking</i> dead?!

22:14.583 --> 22:16.877
<i> She can't hold a knife.</i>
<i>One swift move and--</i>

22:16.960 --> 22:19.921
<i>No, no, she's wrong, I don't hurt people,</i>
<i>especially women,</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:21.631
<i>especially when they're</i>
<i>out of their minds.</i>

22:21.715 --> 22:23.342
<i>No, that is not me.</i>

22:23.592 --> 22:25.302
Candace, can we...

22:26.303 --> 22:28.055
-please just have a truce?
-Stay...

22:28.430 --> 22:29.765
away from me.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.641
I think this is just
some big misunderstanding.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.685
Stop gaslighting me!

22:36.021 --> 22:37.522
You don't want to protect them.

22:39.858 --> 22:40.984
You want to hurt me.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.575
Go ahead.

22:50.952 --> 22:51.870
Do it.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.005
I can't.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.467
<i> It's a lot harder than it looks.</i>

23:08.720 --> 23:10.055
What are you guys doing in here?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.765
Hey.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.183
Is everything all right?

23:13.850 --> 23:15.435
Yeah, um...

23:15.727 --> 23:16.686
Allergies.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.023
Will snuck me some Claritin. Thanks, man.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.525
No problem.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.070
Let's go.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.571
Time to get pretty.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.656
Ooh.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.076
All right.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.327
All right, well...

23:33.703 --> 23:35.539
So, I brought two,

23:35.622 --> 23:37.666
and you can pick whichever one.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.168
Oh, I'm-- I'm fine with either.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.338
Amy, are you okay?

23:44.548 --> 23:47.342
Look, I know my mom can be a handful.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.763
And I know my dad can also be a handful.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.306
Thanks. It's-- it's...

23:53.765 --> 23:55.225
not really that, it's more...

23:56.101 --> 23:57.394
You can tell me anything.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.146
I am a vault.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.691
I don't want to sound crazy.

24:05.068 --> 24:05.902
Well...

24:06.528 --> 24:08.363
you won't and you aren't.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.742
Something bad happened to me...

24:13.368 --> 24:14.369
out in a place like this.

24:15.454 --> 24:19.666
Just, I... I got lost with a guy
who I kind of thought was bad news.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.085
It-- it turned out fine, though.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.838
Well, that's good.

24:26.673 --> 24:27.674
Yeah, I mean, you're...

24:28.341 --> 24:29.593
probably being triggered.

24:30.677 --> 24:33.763
Trauma lives in the body, so,
you know, you can't control it, but...

24:35.682 --> 24:38.310
At the risk of sounding like my mom,

24:38.768 --> 24:41.563
maybe Shaman Open can help.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.858
It's-- it's really no big deal.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.445
You and your family
have been so welcoming.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.696
-Oh...
-And also cool.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.823
I'm glad you think so.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.910
So tell me,
how did you and Will meet?

24:54.993 --> 24:57.579
You two seem <i>so</i> great together.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.415
Oh. Um... work.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.250
I basically forced him to date me.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.793
Ooh, does that get complicated?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.671
-Working with someone you're dating?
-Not really.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.132
Does it get complicated
with you and Forty?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.927
Oh, no, we're great. We're-- we're good.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.096
He... We're actually hiring.
Cinematographers.

25:16.014 --> 25:16.890
Already?

25:17.599 --> 25:18.975
Isn't that a bit early?

25:19.976 --> 25:23.438
No, just-- just establishing...
like, tone.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.066
Yeah, where do you work?
Have you met my friend Lucy?

25:26.566 --> 25:27.567
She works at United.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.569
-Oh, I'm independent.
-Mm-hmm.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.405
And I usually just fly Southwest.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.370
I meant the agency.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.665
-United Talent?
-Oh, right. Um...

25:41.831 --> 25:43.833
No, no. I don't think I've met her.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.795
No, it's...
It's an easy mistake.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.641
Dad.  Finally.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.602
Um... did you get my email?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.813
It's not every man
that can pull off linen.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.441
Can you say hi to me at least?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.111
Forty, I don't want to hear it.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.155
Okay, okay.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.116
Uh, look, I know, but...

26:16.575 --> 26:18.493
Amy actually has a really
incredible idea--

26:18.577 --> 26:19.494
Amy.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.914
Ugh, another walking visible panty line.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.209
Let me guess. She wants to open a...

26:26.543 --> 26:29.671
vegan junk food restaurant,
like Krystal-with-a-K?

26:31.339 --> 26:34.050
Will,
ask him how much he wants.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.469
<i> In times of triangulation,</i>

26:36.553 --> 26:38.888
<i>it's best to stay awkwardly quiet.</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:42.350
Did Forty tell you how he doodled
on his SAT Scantron?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.312
I had to donate a building
to Dartmouth to get him in.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.229
Okay, Dad...

26:46.980 --> 26:51.026
you know that I've struggled
with drug addiction on and off, my...

26:51.109 --> 26:52.986
It's not eczema, Forty.

26:53.987 --> 26:57.365
Addiction's not an on-and-off thing,
and it's no excuse for being a bum.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.245
One hundred K,
this is the last time I ask.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.247
Will-- Will has heard the pitch.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.626
Yeah, I have.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.253
I think it's a great idea.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.839
Your son shows real promise.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.799
Well, if my son wasn't such
a big flapping pussy,

27:14.883 --> 27:17.218
he wouldn't need other people
to carry his water for him.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.431
I'm not writing you another check.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.807
Get a job.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.601
And a life.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.648
-Well...

27:32.108 --> 27:33.568
That is my Postmates.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.654
<i>Yo quiero </i>Taco Bell.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.197
Forty. Forty, are...

27:37.697 --> 27:38.782
Are you okay?

27:39.449 --> 27:40.283
Yeah.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.119
He's a douche, and I am <i>so done</i>

27:43.203 --> 27:45.121
-with all of this vegan bullshit.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.289
You should come with.

27:47.332 --> 27:51.378
Uh, you can service my sister
post-chalupa.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.597
What does the future hold?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.436
Okay. Um, what were you and Amy
talking about earlier?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.980
Oh, why? Did something seem--

28:11.064 --> 28:12.273
No, no. I just...

28:12.357 --> 28:13.441
I caught her in a lie.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.819
And, uh... now I'm worried.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.862
<i> I knew we were on the same page.</i>

28:17.946 --> 28:19.072
I agree, she's...

28:19.280 --> 28:20.699
-she's the worst.

28:20.824 --> 28:21.991
Get rid of her now.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.284
Wait, what?

28:24.494 --> 28:25.412
No, that's aggressive.

28:25.995 --> 28:29.332
And, plus, it would upset Forty.
I mean, what is going on with you?

28:29.958 --> 28:30.959
<i> Wrong page.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:33.169
I know we're not in the Truth Yurt,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.755
but we can still be honest
with each other, right?

28:38.299 --> 28:39.759
You've been... off.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.595
You feel weird, ever since we got here.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.724
<i> I want to tell you everything.</i>

28:45.807 --> 28:49.018
<i>And I will, soon, but for now...</i>

28:49.102 --> 28:50.353
You want to know why I'm weird?

28:50.812 --> 28:52.731
'Cause your family is insane.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.315
I warned you.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.277
You warned me? Your mom can't stop
telling me about her vagina.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.236
She did what?

28:58.319 --> 29:00.071
And your dad,
I just stepped in it with him

29:00.155 --> 29:01.948
trying to help Forty,
which you asked me to do,

29:02.031 --> 29:04.409
and then he made me eat a chalupa,
and now I'm sick.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.326
Wait.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.203
-Forty ordered Taco Bell?
-Yeah.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.705
What...

29:09.581 --> 29:11.374
What? What's happening?

29:11.458 --> 29:12.709
Well, I have to go.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.669
Forty always orders Taco Bell
before he relapses.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.088
You are so obsessed with your brother.
This is not normal.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.298
Just to recap,

29:18.381 --> 29:21.134
you now have a problem
with my mom, my dad,

29:21.217 --> 29:22.761
Forty, me,

29:22.844 --> 29:25.680
-this chick Amy for some reason...
-You don't like her either.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.266
I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I am trying...

29:28.683 --> 29:30.101
to be the perfect boyfriend.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.061
-I want to be so badly,

29:32.145 --> 29:34.647
but you fed me to the wolves, literally.

29:38.651 --> 29:42.363
Thanks for making a stressful weekend
so much worse by starting this fight.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.494
<i> Our first fight.</i>

29:47.911 --> 29:49.370
<i>I blame Candace.</i>

29:49.454 --> 29:50.789
<i>It's time for her to go.</i>

30:03.009 --> 30:06.095
Um, no, I-- I--
I look like cat shit right now.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.472
I'm on my period.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.516
Okay, who gives a fuck. Just let me in.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.272
Jesus, what kind of assholes have you
dated that care about that kind of stuff?

30:17.690 --> 30:18.608
Why are you here?

30:18.691 --> 30:20.819
Uh,  I need those pictures back.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.489
Um... why?

30:25.824 --> 30:26.908
I think you look great...

30:27.534 --> 30:28.618
for the record.

30:30.787 --> 30:34.332
Yeah, uh, they're trying to get a full
picture of what Henderson was into.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.000
I told them that I got a lead on someone

30:36.084 --> 30:39.295
who has some knowledge of some
young girls that we could follow up with.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.718
D, they want to know why he did it.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.515
Okay.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.192
What's wrong?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.320
I left them right here. I...

31:12.912 --> 31:13.788
Hi.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.458
Have you guys seen my brother?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.210
No, not since cornhole.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.130
Are we literally drinking
the Kool-Aid right now?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.048
Goodbye, cruel world.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.138
<i> Candace must go,</i>
<i>but first things first.</i>

31:30.305 --> 31:31.222
<i>Time to apologize.</i>

31:32.473 --> 31:33.892
<i>You're more important than my pride.</i>

31:35.977 --> 31:36.936
Love, I'm sorry.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.188
I cannot be the one
that makes you feel better right now.

31:39.272 --> 31:42.191
I am looking for my brother
and trying to handle my mother and--

31:42.275 --> 31:43.735
Okay, I'll help. I'll find Forty.

31:45.069 --> 31:45.987
Okay.

31:47.488 --> 31:48.448
Thank you.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.914
-Delilah, hey.
<i>-Hey.</i>

31:56.581 --> 31:57.707
Any chance you're with Ellie?

31:57.790 --> 32:00.376
<i> That's what I get</i>
<i>for not parent-spying on her for an hour.</i>

32:00.460 --> 32:03.129
No, but I-- I have some texts from her.
Hang on.

32:10.178 --> 32:14.515
Okay, uh, the-- the Alex Theater<i></i>
is doing a Chandler thing.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.935
<i>-You could try that, but I gotta go.</i>
<i>-</i>Okay, thanks.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.244
<i> Fucking crackheads.</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:45.129
Um...

32:50.885 --> 32:52.387
My parents aren't just parents,

32:53.346 --> 32:54.555
they're lovers.

32:55.056 --> 32:55.890
They're, um...

33:13.533 --> 33:15.034
I hate rom-coms.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.287
-I do. Take away my ovaries.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.539
Want to know why?

33:19.831 --> 33:23.209
Because throughout my life,
when I look at my parents,

33:23.668 --> 33:25.336
their love doesn't feel like one.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.713
You know, it's, um...

33:27.213 --> 33:28.756
fighting over which toilet paper to buy.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.258
And then...

33:30.883 --> 33:33.052
plunging the toilet together
when it gets clogged.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.221
-It's being there...

33:36.514 --> 33:39.017
when someone's damage
makes them impossible.

33:39.976 --> 33:40.810
Knowing...

33:41.519 --> 33:44.188
that they are so much more
than their worst moments.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.524
<i> You're not talking about them.</i>

33:46.607 --> 33:48.443
Contrary to internet opinion,

33:48.526 --> 33:50.361
my parents' love is not perfect.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.155
<i> You're talking about us.</i>

33:52.238 --> 33:53.239
It's, uh...

33:54.407 --> 33:55.533
It's sticky,

33:55.908 --> 33:57.076
messy,

33:57.160 --> 33:59.287
often potentially way too much to handle.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.250
But it is so much better than perfect,
because...

34:05.376 --> 34:06.210
it's real.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.923
Wait. Wait, I want to go.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.592
Forty...

34:12.675 --> 34:14.093
No, I want to go. I want to go.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.472
Um...

34:17.805 --> 34:19.891
-Forty?
- Um, remember...

34:20.308 --> 34:22.935
when they, uh, they dragged us
to the Hoffman Institute

34:23.019 --> 34:25.396
because, uh,
they had differing definitions

34:25.480 --> 34:26.939
of the word "monogamish"?

34:27.023 --> 34:29.108
-That was real.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.651
-I have more. I just, uh--
-Enough, son.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.445
I-- I just need a smoke.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.489
Just need a smoke.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.784
Oh, um, not that one. No, it's fine.
It's-- it's okay. Got it. It's okay.

34:37.867 --> 34:38.868
- It's okay.
-Oh!

34:39.952 --> 34:41.287
It's fine. Everything's...

34:41.829 --> 34:42.914
You look lovely, Mom.

34:43.706 --> 34:44.749
Let's go. It's okay. Shh.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.459
-I don't feel good.
- Yeah.

34:47.085 --> 34:47.919
I do.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.464
Let's party!

34:57.970 --> 34:59.222
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.516
-How are you guys doing?
-You've done enough.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.769
All you ever have to do
is keep your brother safe. You failed.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.729
You disgust me.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.029
You're a fucking hypocrite.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.577
<i> Earth mommy dearest.</i>

35:21.911 --> 35:22.912
<i>Oh, Love.</i>

35:26.040 --> 35:28.376
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.419
-It's okay.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.630
It's okay.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.262
<i> I saw what your mom did.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

35:42.807 --> 35:44.225
My dad hit me a lot.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.398
Why couldn't you tell me?

35:51.482 --> 35:53.693
Probably...
same reason you couldn't tell me.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.821
I couldn't tell you
because I wanted us to stay us.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.867
I didn't want it to be polluted
by all this fucking...

36:04.078 --> 36:04.954
I guess...

36:07.665 --> 36:09.000
my life has been dark.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.378
Well, who you really are...

36:13.129 --> 36:15.006
the dark, that's not a burden.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.883
You don't have to push that away from me.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.760
I want to know you.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.014
I want to know you.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.516
You know, the more I get to know you,
the nicer it is.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.102
I don't just mean the cute parts.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.439
As far as I'm concerned...

36:32.982 --> 36:34.358
we will stay us...

36:35.860 --> 36:36.777
no matter what.

36:40.531 --> 36:43.618
Yeah, I feel like I've been, um...
I've been acting weird,

36:43.701 --> 36:45.745
and I feel like it's because
there's all these things

36:45.828 --> 36:48.748
that I felt like I couldn't tell you,
but, like, fuck that.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.835
Okay, um...

36:54.420 --> 36:55.963
You remember the, um...

36:57.965 --> 37:00.301
the Nilla Wafers, the <i>au pair?</i>

37:00.968 --> 37:01.802
Of course.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.638
My parents started Anavrin

37:03.721 --> 37:05.097
when we were, like, 13.

37:07.016 --> 37:10.019
And they hired this woman, Sofia.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.772
She was, like, 19. She was from Spain.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.026
The way Forty tells it...

37:18.194 --> 37:20.321
she was his first love.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.240
To this day, he does not acknowledge

37:22.323 --> 37:24.909
that it was was abuse.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.624
And eventually my parents
caught them together,

37:32.208 --> 37:33.042
and...

37:33.793 --> 37:35.711
so much shit ensued.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.131
And... they let her go.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.343
And she was troubled.

37:43.844 --> 37:44.887
She killed herself.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.184
Forty's the one who found the body.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.856
Yeah, and nothing has ever
really been the same.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.860
My parents kept everything quiet
with money.

38:03.781 --> 38:04.824
Yeah.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.452
I get that Forty is a lot. I know.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.250
And I know
that I take care of him too much.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.003
But...

38:18.129 --> 38:20.423
you've met my parents now,
so you know why.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.508
I'm stuck with him.

38:22.591 --> 38:23.426
No.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.219
<i>We</i> are.

38:31.892 --> 38:34.353
<i> I don't think</i>
<i>I've ever been in love before.</i>

38:36.814 --> 38:39.900
<i>-It's been infatuation.</i>

38:40.943 --> 38:42.903
<i>This is it.</i>

38:43.279 --> 38:46.490
<i>Accepting you're not perfect</i>
<i>and loving you more for it.</i>

38:57.209 --> 38:58.377
What the fuck?

39:05.009 --> 39:06.469
I'm sorry, did that trigger you?

39:21.067 --> 39:22.777
Can I tell you I love you yet?

39:27.406 --> 39:28.282
Whenever you're ready.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.872
In the meantime, let me say...

39:36.624 --> 39:37.792
I love you...

39:38.292 --> 39:39.126
Love.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.297
Ugh, it's a complicated word.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.966
Oh, yeah.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.010
Is there another word we can use?
Our word?

39:48.969 --> 39:49.887
Um...

39:52.181 --> 39:53.432
I wolf you.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.352
I wolf you too.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.065
I like it.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.859
It's like you're part of my pack.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.238
I am your pack.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.516
-Hey!
-Klepto.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.101
The police came for these.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.770
-The actual police or your fuckboy?
-Why would you take these?

40:42.565 --> 40:44.108
I couldn't believe he would do this.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.029
But I do now.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.244
I'm sorry I was being such an asshole.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.164
It's okay.

41:02.042 --> 41:03.544
I think we should burn those.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.505
If these photos were ever leaked...

41:07.089 --> 41:09.258
every time someone googled the girls,

41:09.341 --> 41:10.384
it would just...

41:13.387 --> 41:14.930
What would you want done with yours?

41:18.350 --> 41:19.351
Hey, just so you know...

41:21.437 --> 41:24.148
nothing could ever
make me see you different.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.167
<i>Tell me again what happened.</i>

41:43.834 --> 41:46.629
Um, my boyfriend... ex...

41:47.129 --> 41:48.005
We fought.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.174
And he...

41:50.841 --> 41:52.259
He took me to the woods.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.427
Um...

41:54.512 --> 41:56.347
I don't remember what happened next.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.599
I just... I-- I woke up.

41:59.558 --> 42:00.392
Like...

42:02.019 --> 42:02.978
buried.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.774
We sent a car out. No tire marks.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.025
No, he dug a grave.

42:09.443 --> 42:12.154
A lot of tree removal in that area, right?
Loose dirt.

42:12.655 --> 42:13.697
No one saw anything?

42:14.698 --> 42:17.326
You happen to take any pictures
or save any texts between you?

42:17.409 --> 42:18.327
No!

42:18.786 --> 42:20.454
He has my phone!

42:20.996 --> 42:23.541
I mean, isn't there any DNA
where he buried me alive?

42:23.624 --> 42:26.293
This isn't <i>CSI,</i> all right?
We're in Putnam County.

42:27.461 --> 42:29.380
So you have no proof?

42:34.843 --> 42:37.888
Honey, let me level with you, all right?

42:38.472 --> 42:39.306
I looked you up.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.475
-You have a rap sheet.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.061
Ever had any friends go through
with reporting assault?

42:46.230 --> 42:47.731
This'll be labeled domestic violence.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.108
This isn't--

42:50.150 --> 42:52.444
He tried to murder me.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.739
The best we can do
is get a restraining order.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.157
Right, temp for three months.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.285
For a permanent one,
you'll have to stand before a judge,

42:59.410 --> 43:01.203
-so will he.
-But it will be permanent?

43:01.287 --> 43:02.997
Well, three years.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.331
And then file again.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.792
If you have no pics, no proof...

43:09.420 --> 43:11.130
What am I supposed to do?

43:20.014 --> 43:21.223
He thinks you're dead?

43:21.849 --> 43:24.226
You want some really
off-the-record advice?

43:25.352 --> 43:26.312
Stay that way.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.526
This is unreal.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.204
Figured you'd come find me.

43:50.377 --> 43:53.464
Crazy family
we've fallen into, huh?

43:55.132 --> 43:56.133
So now you see I'm not--

43:56.383 --> 43:58.052
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.930
If you really had something on me...

44:03.849 --> 44:07.019
-you would've turned me in already.
-I'm not afraid of you either.

44:07.394 --> 44:08.687
Why would you be afraid of me?

44:09.772 --> 44:10.981
Candace, it was an accident.

44:13.233 --> 44:14.234
End of story.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.365
I never tried to kill you.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.617
Yeah. You know what they say?

44:22.326 --> 44:25.829
You never know if you're fight or flight
until you're forced to find out.

44:26.205 --> 44:27.206
Turns out...

44:29.500 --> 44:30.417
I'm fight.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.338
So now I found you,

44:34.421 --> 44:36.298
I'm not going anywhere,

44:36.382 --> 44:39.343
and I don't care what story
you tell yourself,

44:39.426 --> 44:42.388
because all I have to do
is wait for you to mess up.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.142
Murder has a way of following you.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.687
And you're not getting away with it.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.205
<i>Things aren't over with Candace.</i>

45:08.997 --> 45:12.543
<i>But I have to rest</i>
<i>before I plan my next move.</i>

45:12.918 --> 45:14.420
<i>Wellness is exhausting.</i>

45:19.466 --> 45:20.300
<i>Huh.</i>

45:20.926 --> 45:23.011
<i>A postcard from Will in Manila.</i>

45:23.512 --> 45:25.055
<i>It's going well with Gigi.</i>

45:26.098 --> 45:28.642
<i>If I stay committed to being a good man,</i>

45:28.976 --> 45:30.769
<i>things might work themselves out.</i>

45:31.061 --> 45:33.105
My God, why aren't they burning?

45:33.188 --> 45:34.815
We need kindling.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.984
Oh, man.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.404
Evidently, there's toxins in Polaroids.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.080
All right, there's one more.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.331
-Aw.
-I wolf you.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.791
Mm. Do you now?

46:33.874 --> 46:35.042
-Yeah.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.840
Do you want to go to the stockroom?

46:41.924 --> 46:43.675
Yes, I would like that very much.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.430
Stop with the PDA.

46:50.432 --> 46:52.351
Before anybody asks...

46:52.643 --> 46:54.686
Amy picked me up from a meeting,

46:54.770 --> 46:56.396
where I found a new sponsor.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.273
Can't name names, but, uh...

46:58.357 --> 47:00.818
-let's just say the Academy robbed him.

47:00.901 --> 47:03.862
Anyway, I will have to make amends.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.490
So I promise I will apologize
to both of you...

47:07.157 --> 47:08.909
whenever I get to that step.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.369
You don't need to do that.

47:11.578 --> 47:12.913
I'm just glad you're okay.

47:14.039 --> 47:17.084
I really am.
And, um, I'm staying busy too.

47:17.167 --> 47:21.338
I mean... adapting this book
Amy found for us is going to consume me,

47:21.839 --> 47:23.757
in the best way possible.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.426
-Thank fuck we got that option.

47:26.802 --> 47:27.845
What's the book?

47:27.928 --> 47:31.056
I thought you were busy prepping
<i>Bang, Marry, Kill.</i>

47:31.139 --> 47:33.600
Yeah, that felt like more
of a second feature.

47:33.684 --> 47:36.061
But, uh...
Amy turned me on to this memoir.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.276
Yeah, this main character, Beck...

47:42.609 --> 47:44.570
she really speaks to me, you know?

47:45.153 --> 47:47.155
-She just wanted to be loved.
- Mm.

47:47.239 --> 47:50.784
-<i> She's worse than Eva Braun.</i>
-Oh! Ugh!

47:50.909 --> 47:53.328
Anyway, just waiting for the deal points
to come through, but--

47:53.412 --> 47:55.247
- Oh, my God.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.543
Holy fuck.

48:00.168 --> 48:01.503
-No way.
-What?

48:01.587 --> 48:02.796
- Hold on.
-What happened?

48:02.880 --> 48:03.755
No way.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.134
Now they're saying
they think Henderson was murdered.

48:09.094 --> 48:12.055
<i> Benji, Peach, Beck,</i>
<i>Ron, Jasper, Henderson...</i>

48:12.848 --> 48:15.809
Well, if-- if that's true,
a famous man like Henderson,

48:15.893 --> 48:18.186
they won't stop
until they find who did it, right?

48:18.270 --> 48:20.022
-Right.
-He won't get away with it.

48:23.692 --> 48:25.402
Murder has a way of following you.
