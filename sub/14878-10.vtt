WEBVTT

00:07.382 --> 00:10.803
- Late night?
- My boss is still there, not complaining.

00:10.804 --> 00:13.932
- Roast beef on a top shelf.
- I'm thinking more of a rocky road

00:20.145 --> 00:23.357
You're waiting up for me.
- I have a favoure to ask you

00:23.358 --> 00:27.195
actually Chloe does. She had 3rd grade
field trip to Mount Vermon bum out.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.433
Sensitive tooth.

00:29.501 --> 00:31.202
- Dentist.
- Stop. Chloe.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.938
Anyway, her class needs
a replacement field trip,

00:34.006 --> 00:36.140
and she kind of volunteered you.

00:36.208 --> 00:38.342
- Me?
- And the Smithsonian.

00:38.410 --> 00:39.677
<i>It would be kind of a night
at the museum kind of thing,</i>

00:39.745 --> 00:41.512
except during the day.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.181
You know Chloe. Anyway,
her teacher called...

00:43.248 --> 00:44.982
- when?
- This Thursday, 8:30 to 12:00,

00:45.050 --> 00:46.317
30 third graders, 2 teachers,

00:46.385 --> 00:48.820
a couple of moms, me.
That's in two days.

00:48.887 --> 00:50.154
Yeah, well, it would mean a lot.

00:50.222 --> 00:52.123
And I'd get to see
where you work, you know,

00:52.191 --> 00:53.825
meet your peeps,

00:53.892 --> 00:55.293
this boss who works at the museum

00:55.360 --> 00:56.861
until 11:30 at night.

00:56.929 --> 01:00.698
Yes, you should see where I work.

01:00.766 --> 01:01.632
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.634
And meet my boss.

01:03.702 --> 01:04.669
I'll set something up.

01:04.736 --> 01:06.571
You're the best.

01:06.638 --> 01:08.372
I got to go to bed. Night.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.473
- Mwah.
- Ow.

01:09.541 --> 01:13.544
- Dentist.
- Stop.

01:16.515 --> 01:18.349
Excuse me. These
are medical supplies.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.051
They've already been
papered and pre-cleared

01:20.118 --> 01:21.252
at the U.S. embassy in London.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.820
Let's go.

01:22.888 --> 01:24.722
Move it along.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.694
What's his name?

01:29.761 --> 01:31.128
Don Ridley.

01:31.196 --> 01:32.496
Runs a medical supply house in Brooklyn.

01:32.564 --> 01:34.999
Looks like a pharmacist.

01:35.067 --> 01:36.601
A nervous pharmacist.

01:36.668 --> 01:38.769
Guilty pharmacist.

01:38.837 --> 01:39.737
His name popped up in some chatter

01:39.805 --> 01:40.805
we picked up in Angola.

01:40.873 --> 01:43.040
Angola.

01:43.108 --> 01:45.676
I don't understand
what the problem is.

01:48.046 --> 01:49.780
Can we get closer
on the crate, please?

01:53.452 --> 01:54.952
Rough diamonds.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.991 --> 02:34.625
Hands up. On the floor.

02:38.530 --> 02:41.632
Joan, who's running
the interrogation?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.367
The bureau.

02:43.435 --> 02:45.102
We have two guys there

02:45.170 --> 02:47.939
from the new York station,
and we'll monitor from here.

02:48.006 --> 02:50.574
The DNI wants us to
read in Henry Wilcox

02:50.642 --> 02:53.678
on the Angola connection.

02:53.745 --> 02:54.912
So if you see him wandering the halls...

02:54.980 --> 02:57.281
If I see him wandering the halls,

02:57.349 --> 02:59.283
I will turn around
and walk the other way.

02:59.351 --> 03:00.451
The last thing we need is your old boss

03:00.519 --> 03:02.320
telling us what we're doing wrong.

03:02.387 --> 03:04.388
Well, the director
wants all hands on deck.

03:04.456 --> 03:05.723
And with Henry's experience...

03:05.791 --> 03:08.592
Henry Wilcox is a
dangerous old windbag

03:08.660 --> 03:10.127
angling to come out of retirement.

03:10.195 --> 03:11.329
You have just as much experience

03:11.396 --> 03:12.330
and twice as good judgment.

03:12.397 --> 03:13.798
Yes, I do.

03:13.865 --> 03:16.667
But in this bureaucracy,
apparently that doesn't matter.

03:19.004 --> 03:22.173
You look tired, Arthur.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.675
I haven't been getting
much sleep lately.

03:24.743 --> 03:27.111
Then sleep in our bed tonight.

03:28.714 --> 03:31.349
I'll be here if you need me.

03:38.390 --> 03:41.392
Okay, Danielle, we are all set.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.394
I need the names of all the kids

03:43.462 --> 03:44.929
and the teachers and the moms.

03:44.997 --> 03:46.630
They have to make security passes.

03:46.698 --> 03:48.599
And tell Chloe that it's
not going to be quite

03:48.667 --> 03:50.101
<i>night at the museum.</i>

03:50.168 --> 03:53.371
There's no Teddy Roosevelt
and mischievous monkeys.

03:53.438 --> 03:55.373
At least, not to my knowledge.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.308
Right. 8:30 Thursday.

03:57.376 --> 04:00.077
I will meet you outside the entrance.

04:00.145 --> 04:02.913
I love you too.

04:02.981 --> 04:07.284
No, it feels fine.

04:07.352 --> 04:08.819
Something bothering you?

04:08.887 --> 04:10.554
My tooth is killing me.

04:10.622 --> 04:12.590
You know, we have an
excellent dental plan.

04:12.657 --> 04:15.659
Which I will use when
I'm sure something's wrong.

04:15.727 --> 04:17.862
- Oh, a yellow.
-Bellied masochist.

04:17.928 --> 04:20.664
- I am not yellow.
-Bellied.

04:20.732 --> 04:24.168
Let's just say I had a few
less-than-pleasant experiences

04:24.236 --> 04:26.771
with military base dentists as a kid.

04:26.838 --> 04:28.939
But anyone organizing a field trip

04:29.007 --> 04:30.541
for 30 third-graders is a masochist

04:30.609 --> 04:31.909
for sure.

04:31.977 --> 04:33.377
It reinforces my
cover with my sister,

04:33.445 --> 04:34.412
and I couldn't say no.
Thank you.

04:34.479 --> 04:35.913
It was my niece asking.

04:35.981 --> 04:36.981
This was a must-do.

04:37.049 --> 04:38.616
I had no option.

04:40.052 --> 04:43.054
No. You can ask me 1,000 times.

04:43.121 --> 04:44.388
I had no idea there was anything

04:44.456 --> 04:46.557
other than medical
equipment in those crates.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.259
He's been back and forth to London

04:48.326 --> 04:50.828
20 times in the past eight months,

04:50.896 --> 04:52.730
each time with a prescreened manifest

04:52.798 --> 04:54.665
arranged by the U.S.
Embassy. Mm...hmm.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.634
Someone at the embassy's involved.

04:56.701 --> 04:58.035
We're drilling down on it.

04:58.103 --> 04:59.336
How much were those diamonds worth?

04:59.404 --> 05:01.072
$1 1/2 million using
the Rappaport scale.

05:01.139 --> 05:04.775
Financing arms for
Angolan insurgents, huh?

05:04.843 --> 05:06.043
Well, that's our best guess now,

05:06.111 --> 05:08.079
but whatever those
diamonds were financing,

05:08.146 --> 05:09.413
Ridley was the conduit,

05:09.481 --> 05:11.148
the courier.
Not anymore.

05:11.216 --> 05:13.350
No, and that's got
to be a pretty big loss

05:13.418 --> 05:14.618
to whoever was running him.
Huge.

05:14.686 --> 05:16.787
Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing

05:16.855 --> 05:19.957
if we could open that conduit back up?

05:20.025 --> 05:23.427
What if we could replace
him with one of our people?

05:23.495 --> 05:27.064
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

05:27.132 --> 05:29.767
Anything involving a third-grade class

05:29.835 --> 05:31.302
is an automatic no.

05:31.369 --> 05:33.304
It's your constitutional right.

05:33.371 --> 05:36.340
You can say no to line
dancing, to karaoke,

05:36.408 --> 05:37.541
duck pin bowling with
your aunt Louise...

05:37.609 --> 05:39.443
Hey.

05:39.511 --> 05:42.980
And anything coming
out of Jai Wilcox's mouth.

05:43.048 --> 05:44.682
Except for the next two things.

05:44.749 --> 05:45.749
First, we need you in
the conference room.

05:45.817 --> 05:47.585
What's the second thing?

05:47.652 --> 05:49.353
You can't say no to
Joan's next question.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.558
Annie.

05:54.626 --> 05:55.693
How'd you like a trip to London?

05:57.329 --> 06:01.932
Now that would be
just stupid to refuse.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.797
Ridley's expediter at the embassy

06:37.865 --> 06:39.766
has been a young vice-consul
named Vivian Long.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.701
Expediter?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.436
One of the roles
consular services plays

06:43.504 --> 06:45.238
is aiding U.S. businesses
while working abroad.

06:45.306 --> 06:46.973
They help with trade manifests,

06:47.041 --> 06:49.276
custom clearances, you name it.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.411
- Ms. Long had Ridley's shipment pre.
-Papered through customs

06:51.479 --> 06:53.213
so they wouldn't be inspected.

06:53.281 --> 06:55.682
Clearly giving him more help
than he deserved or needed.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.950
She's definitely complicit.

06:57.018 --> 06:58.918
I spoke to the consul general.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.854
He described her as hardworking, likable

07:00.921 --> 07:02.355
and without much of a social life.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.423
An American Bridget Jones?

07:03.491 --> 07:05.292
It looks like.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.427
You know, she actually
applied to the agency.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.628
But she couldn't pass

07:08.696 --> 07:09.729
the athletic portion of the physical.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.031
She doesn't look like a bad guy.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.632
Well, she's certainly
doing someone favors.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.835
And one of those favors is
going to be recruiting you.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.004
Okay. Am I missing something?

07:18.072 --> 07:19.239
Well, with Ridley out of commission,

07:19.307 --> 07:20.740
they'll be needing a new courier.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.943
The Smithsonian constantly
shifts stuff back and forth

07:24.011 --> 07:24.944
to the U.K.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.313
Your cover makes you

07:26.380 --> 07:28.148
the perfect candidate
to take Ridley's place.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.284
It's a flip on what
case officers usually do.

07:31.352 --> 07:32.919
This time, you will be the mark.

07:32.987 --> 07:34.354
You will be the one putting herself

07:34.422 --> 07:35.889
in a compromising position

07:35.956 --> 07:37.891
so that you can be turned and used.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.826
You would be operating
completely on your own.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.261
Your phone will be unencrypted.

07:41.329 --> 07:43.496
Everything you do,
everything you're carrying

07:43.564 --> 07:45.832
will be examined by them
before they approach you.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.101
Now, I'll be coming over with you,

07:48.169 --> 07:49.336
but we can't have any contact.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.171
It's a deep cover operation.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.506
Just how are we planning
on compromising me?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.176
Your file says you
enjoy playing craps

07:56.243 --> 07:57.944
from time to time.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.312
Annie Walker

07:59.380 --> 08:00.647
of the Smithsonian is going to have

08:00.715 --> 08:02.515
a very serious gambling problem.

08:08.122 --> 08:09.522
I'm in London, Danielle.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.591
I'm delivering pre-columbian artifacts

08:11.659 --> 08:12.759
to the British museum.

08:12.827 --> 08:14.160
It was so last minute, I'm sorry

08:14.228 --> 08:16.563
I didn't get a chance to say good-bye.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.599
No, Chloe's gonna get her
tour with or without me.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.501
It's been completely set up,
and if you have any problems,

08:21.569 --> 08:24.137
I'll be on my cell.

08:24.205 --> 08:27.107
There should be four
crates for the Smithsonian.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.575
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.343
Are you Annie Walker?

08:30.411 --> 08:31.644
Yes.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.046
Vivian Long from the embassy.

08:33.114 --> 08:34.614
I am so sorry.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.649
I was gonna meet you at the
gate... diplomats can do that...

08:36.717 --> 08:38.318
but a cab cut me off in a roundabout,

08:38.385 --> 08:39.852
and I dumped my ice latte.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.554
- Oh, my God.
- You think it'll stain?

08:41.621 --> 08:42.856
- Yeah.
- Thank God Seattle's best

08:42.923 --> 08:43.990
went global.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.258
We can grab another one on the way.

08:45.326 --> 08:46.559
David, this is Annie Walker

08:46.627 --> 08:48.194
from the Smithsonian institute.

08:48.262 --> 08:49.796
She's bringing in four crates

08:49.864 --> 08:51.564
with pre-columbian artifacts in them.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.966
The lorry from the British museum

08:53.033 --> 08:54.067
is already at the loading docks,

08:54.135 --> 08:55.301
so if you could please sign off

08:55.369 --> 08:57.404
and have 'em brought out.

08:57.471 --> 08:58.738
Oh, I have biscuits for you.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.039
David's a cheap bribe.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.775
You look in pain.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.710
Oh, I have a little
toothache. It's fine.

09:03.778 --> 09:05.145
- Terrific. I'm double.
-Parked.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.954
- First time?
- Second.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.756
I had a two-day layover as a kid.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.926
My dad was in the military.
Mine too.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.194
Vietnam vet. Lost a leg at Khe Sanh

09:21.262 --> 09:22.462
during the Tet offensive.

09:22.530 --> 09:23.663
Sorry, too much information.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.734
If I talk too fast, slow me down.

09:27.802 --> 09:29.269
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.503
I thought I would never
be able to drive here,

09:30.571 --> 09:34.507
and look at me now.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.975
I love this place.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.477
Couldn't take my eyes off of it

09:37.545 --> 09:38.511
when I first got here.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.646
I mean, the history.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.980
I know. It's crazy.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.515
I'm gonna be bringing
stuff back and forth

09:42.583 --> 09:44.951
at least twice a month.
Seriously?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.286
Yeah, the pay's lousy,
but who'd have thunk

09:46.353 --> 09:48.021
a job at the Smithsonian
could be this much fun?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.456
You have friends here?

09:49.523 --> 09:51.357
Second cousin on my
mother's side, so no.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.126
Not one.
Well, if you need someone

09:53.194 --> 09:55.128
to show you around...

09:55.196 --> 09:56.696
Don't offer if you can't deliver.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.731
Please. I work for
the state department.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.633
Does that mean you have connections?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.068
All over the city.

10:02.136 --> 10:03.303
Restaurants, clubs.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.239
Gaming establishments?

10:06.307 --> 10:08.508
- You gamble?
- Are you kidding?

10:08.576 --> 10:11.211
I killed at craps in
Atlantic city last weekend.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.247
I am on a hot streak.
Ever heard of Havery's?

10:14.315 --> 10:16.583
Get out. James Bond played there.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.784
I'm good friends with the manager.

10:17.852 --> 10:18.952
I have to pull rich Americans

10:19.019 --> 10:20.186
out of there all the time.

10:20.254 --> 10:21.688
Can you get us in there tonight?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.122
But I have to warn you, they
don't let foreign nationals

10:23.190 --> 10:25.191
out of the U.K. with
unpaid gaming debts.

10:25.259 --> 10:26.626
Please. I am telling you,

10:26.694 --> 10:28.294
I can't lose.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.199
Burned coffee and stale doughnuts.

10:33.267 --> 10:35.635
The bat cave never changes.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.504
You look like crap.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.472
- Aw, so do you.
- Thank you.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.374
You sleep on the plane?
Not enough.

10:41.442 --> 10:43.142
Langley says you have
a backtrack on Ridley.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.211
Yeah, it's a start.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.247
10,000 closed-circuit
cameras in the city,

10:47.314 --> 10:48.581
and only half work.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.583
Here's Ridley unloading the cases

10:50.651 --> 10:51.751
at the airport with Vivian.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.486
We tracked him back from unloading,

10:53.554 --> 10:56.089
driving out from the city,

10:56.156 --> 10:57.891
all the way to Camden.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.559
- Any stops?
- Nothing.

10:59.627 --> 11:00.960
We lost him somewhere in
the warehouse district.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.295
It must be where he
picked up the diamonds.

11:02.363 --> 11:03.930
There's no medical
warehouse in the vicinity.

11:03.998 --> 11:04.931
And Vivian Long?

11:04.999 --> 11:06.266
I can't believe

11:06.333 --> 11:07.634
she'd be involved in
something like this.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.768
Had us fooled completely.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.769
Background's clean,

11:09.837 --> 11:10.770
bona fides real.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.105
My people have got no idea

11:12.172 --> 11:15.074
what they got on her, but we're digging.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.509
Dig carefully.

11:16.577 --> 11:18.411
She could be valuable to us.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.018
It's beautiful.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.453
Pre-classic Olmec, right?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.389
They teach you that
at the state department?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.324
I did a little research last night.

11:31.392 --> 11:34.060
- So you're a wonk.
- I'm conscientious.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.628
You don't have to be a
wonk to be conscientious.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.864
Um, over here is what

11:37.932 --> 11:39.232
you'll be taking over to the States.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.302
Ming dynasty imperial
floor vases, 15th century,

11:42.369 --> 11:43.903
Jing de Zhen.

11:43.971 --> 11:44.871
Correct.

11:44.939 --> 11:46.472
Wonk.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.108
We'll work on getting you prepared.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.946
You should be able to
avoid U.S. customs entirely.

11:54.582 --> 11:57.250
Smithsonian institute,
how may I direct your call?

11:57.318 --> 11:59.586
I thought we weren't
doing that until tonight.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.487
I like to practice. How's the tooth?

12:01.555 --> 12:02.622
Still in my mouth.

12:02.690 --> 12:04.057
Not very happy.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.658
Not the tooth's fault.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.595
We got any hard evidence on Vivian?

12:08.662 --> 12:10.730
So far, just the
stuff she did for Ridley.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.098
I like her.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.199
Doesn't matter.

12:13.267 --> 12:14.801
She fooled the entire embassy.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.070
She can fool you.
Yes, Jonathan.

12:17.137 --> 12:21.174
She's definitely gonna
be going back and forth.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.177
It's just that I like her. Okay?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.345
I wish it could be somebody else.

12:27.615 --> 12:28.982
She buying your story?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.150
She's calling to get
us into Havery's tonight.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.920
Hmm. That means they're
gonna start circling.

12:33.988 --> 12:36.356
Listen, this has to be
our last open phone call.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.257
From now on, you have to
assume you're being watched.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.859
Are you wearing your encrypted phone?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.127
Strapped to my thigh.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.162
Not very comfortable.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.064
Only use it in an emergency.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.499
Got it.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.768
She's giving me the thumbs-up.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.969
We're in.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.804
Okay. Drink till you're sloppy,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.106
and mix your bets.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.340
Remember, you've got to lose

12:54.408 --> 12:55.942
without looking like you're trying.

12:56.010 --> 12:58.311
The way I play,
shouldn't be a problem.

13:07.599 --> 13:09.634
I guess there are only two
ways to retire from this place...

13:09.702 --> 13:11.803
die or defect.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.872
So you gave up and shaved
your retirement beard.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.741
When duty calls, I answer.

13:16.809 --> 13:18.743
Understand that this
is a consultation, Henry.

13:18.811 --> 13:20.778
I'm still the DCS.

13:20.846 --> 13:23.481
The DCS who needs a little
help from his old boss.

13:23.549 --> 13:25.683
Oh, I may not like you,
but I respect your talent.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.685
Isn't that funny? I like you, Arthur,

13:27.753 --> 13:29.153
but I don't respect your talent at all.

13:29.221 --> 13:31.322
Hmm.

13:34.093 --> 13:35.993
If Liza Hearn keeps
digging into dark ops,

13:36.061 --> 13:37.862
you'll wind up on Capitol Hill

13:37.930 --> 13:38.863
or in jail.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.298
You'll be with me.

13:40.365 --> 13:43.968
No. They never go
after emeritus officials.

13:44.036 --> 13:47.171
Look at Kissinger, Al Haig, Rumsfeld.

13:47.239 --> 13:49.140
So I inherit everything you started.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.042
It seems that's the
way it works, Arthur.

13:52.411 --> 13:54.378
I suggest you plug that leak.

13:57.049 --> 13:59.617
In the meantime, let's concentrate

13:59.685 --> 14:00.918
on business at hand.

14:00.986 --> 14:03.354
Glad to be of service.

14:05.624 --> 14:07.258
- Is he breaking?
- Not yet.

14:07.326 --> 14:09.494
Denies knowing what the diamonds
might be buying in the U.S.

14:09.561 --> 14:10.795
Or anything about Angola.

14:10.863 --> 14:12.497
Including what hemisphere it's in.

14:12.564 --> 14:14.732
But I can hear him breaking.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.534
They're asking him about Camden
and the warehouse district.

14:16.602 --> 14:18.669
Look, I have very low blood sugar.

14:18.737 --> 14:19.871
If I give you an address,

14:19.938 --> 14:22.006
can I have some food?

14:22.074 --> 14:24.142
What'd I tell you?

14:24.209 --> 14:26.811
All right, get that address
to Jai as soon as possible.

14:26.879 --> 14:31.616
You have to sign
there, there, and there.

14:31.683 --> 14:34.385
Basically, it says if anything happens

14:34.453 --> 14:36.654
to the shipment, it's
your fault, not ours.

14:36.722 --> 14:38.156
Joke.

14:38.223 --> 14:39.223
So is this what you guys do?

14:39.291 --> 14:42.627
We do commerce, visa, apps,

14:42.694 --> 14:44.662
marriage approvals for green cards.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.564
We provide bail, roadside assistance.

14:46.632 --> 14:48.065
Kidding.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.667
So, no, we do a lot more than commerce.

14:49.735 --> 14:52.036
Who are those guys?

14:52.104 --> 14:53.671
Basement people.

14:53.739 --> 14:55.640
And that means...

14:55.707 --> 14:57.108
They do the jobs that don't exist.

14:57.176 --> 14:58.810
They're spooks?

14:58.877 --> 14:59.977
But you didn't hear that from me.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.919
Right.

15:07.986 --> 15:10.054
Did you say 1218?

15:10.122 --> 15:13.124
1218. Ridley said it
was a gray stone building.

15:13.192 --> 15:16.060
Used to be a distillery that
they turned into a dance club.

15:16.128 --> 15:18.129
You need GPS coords?

15:18.197 --> 15:21.799
Uh, no, I think we
can find it on our own.

16:02.174 --> 16:04.508
Lapidary scale.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.201
They're certain it was a woman.

16:30.269 --> 16:32.069
Lifted some prints off a desk.

16:32.137 --> 16:33.504
They're running them through the grid.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.473
The rest of the place was cleaned out.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.241
Probably had a cutoff man at Kennedy

16:37.309 --> 16:38.609
that warned them as
soon as he was arrested.

16:38.677 --> 16:40.111
This the courier
we're trying to replace?

16:40.178 --> 16:41.746
Oh, hello, Henry.

16:41.813 --> 16:44.949
Nice to see you as well.
Clean-shaven this time.

16:45.017 --> 16:46.918
Donald Ridley, yes.

16:46.985 --> 16:49.053
He's not telling us very much, though.

16:49.121 --> 16:51.255
The bureau's too squeamish
to get anything worthwhile.

16:51.323 --> 16:53.024
What do we know?

16:53.091 --> 16:55.192
- Newly married, church.
-Going,

16:55.260 --> 16:58.429
drinks an occasional beer,
pays his bills and taxes.

16:58.497 --> 17:00.798
No criminal affiliations,
off-shore accounts,

17:00.866 --> 17:02.099
or medical problems.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.868
FBI swept his house. It's clean.

17:03.936 --> 17:05.603
Sounds like he'll run for office.

17:05.671 --> 17:07.905
What about his bride?

17:07.973 --> 17:09.240
She's still in Brighton,

17:09.308 --> 17:11.541
because she's English,
awaiting her green card.

17:11.609 --> 17:12.910
Our embassy would do that.

17:12.978 --> 17:14.578
Mm...hmm. Specifically
a vice-consul

17:14.646 --> 17:16.113
like Vivian Long.

17:16.181 --> 17:17.714
So she's helping them
do more than ship things.

17:17.782 --> 17:18.848
We're getting a record of
everything that she's done

17:18.916 --> 17:20.718
at the embassy, but, yeah, she could be

17:20.786 --> 17:22.086
a real window into the operation.

17:22.154 --> 17:23.753
- He never mentions her.
- Who?

17:23.821 --> 17:26.022
In the transcripts, Ridley
never mentions his wife.

17:26.090 --> 17:28.559
Hasn't asked that she
be contacted, nothing.

17:28.627 --> 17:30.061
That strike anyone as strange?

17:30.128 --> 17:35.333
I think we have a photo.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.201
Patricia Ridley.

17:37.269 --> 17:40.404
Does this look like a woman
who would marry a pharmacist?

17:40.472 --> 17:42.139
I'm guessing no.

17:47.546 --> 17:51.415
Oh, my God.

17:54.353 --> 17:55.619
I always feel
like a six-year-old

17:55.687 --> 17:57.989
at my parents' cocktail party.

17:58.056 --> 18:00.458
Nonsense.

18:00.525 --> 18:02.426
We're walking in with 10 grand

18:02.494 --> 18:05.329
and walking out with 20.

18:08.100 --> 18:13.404
- See you later, Viv?
- If you promise to be nice.

18:13.472 --> 18:15.673
Are you holding out on me?

18:15.741 --> 18:18.009
His name's Jonathan Turnbull,

18:18.076 --> 18:20.444
and vice-consuls don't
work all the time.

18:29.588 --> 18:32.690
Five. The point is five.

18:32.758 --> 18:34.592
Mark it.

18:34.659 --> 18:37.461
Pays 3 to 2 behind the line.

18:37.529 --> 18:39.163
You gonna play?

18:39.231 --> 18:40.164
The least I can do

18:40.232 --> 18:41.132
is front you some chips.

18:41.199 --> 18:43.634
I'm kind of a gambling moron.

18:43.702 --> 18:46.103
Then hold my purse.

18:46.171 --> 18:48.072
Flirt with handsome.
He's coming this way.

18:51.443 --> 18:53.911
Five. The winner is five.

18:53.979 --> 18:57.281
Pay the line.

18:59.051 --> 19:01.285
Like taking candy from a baby.

19:25.744 --> 19:27.912
- Hey, Auggie.
- Annie's at the table.

19:27.979 --> 19:29.213
They already lifted her phone

19:29.281 --> 19:30.214
and room key.

19:30.282 --> 19:31.849
Anything on the bride?

19:31.917 --> 19:33.184
London's getting
the marriage documents

19:33.251 --> 19:34.552
for a thumbprint.

19:34.619 --> 19:38.656
Oh, and right on cue.

19:38.723 --> 19:42.660
Smithsonian institute,
how may I direct your call?

19:42.727 --> 19:46.097
Annie Walker. One moment, please.

19:46.164 --> 19:47.465
You've reached Annie Walker

19:47.532 --> 19:48.833
in the acquisitions department.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.602
I'm unable to return...

19:51.670 --> 19:53.270
That was boodles up with a twist?

19:53.338 --> 19:58.175
Thank you so much.
They are truly delicious.

19:58.243 --> 20:01.412
I'm not so sure you
should mix drinking

20:01.480 --> 20:02.947
with gambling.
There's two things

20:03.014 --> 20:04.181
that cure a
toothache, Vivian...

20:04.249 --> 20:06.283
winning and gin.

20:06.351 --> 20:08.452
We've got the gin.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.720
Let's start some serious winning.

20:09.788 --> 20:11.188
Coast-to-coast.

20:30.609 --> 20:32.376
- Ooh.
-Hoo.

20:32.444 --> 20:34.311
Excuse me.

20:38.483 --> 20:41.051
I believe I need a line of
credit to finish my evening.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.521
Is there a way to arrange that?

20:43.588 --> 20:46.023
Annie, are you sure
you want to do this?

20:46.091 --> 20:47.691
I'm on fire, Vivian.

20:47.759 --> 20:48.626
I just need a little more capital.

20:48.693 --> 20:49.960
Is that possible?

20:50.028 --> 20:51.762
Well, with the U.S.
Embassy at your side,

20:51.830 --> 20:53.564
we'd be happy to extend you

20:53.632 --> 20:54.565
5,000 pounds.

20:54.633 --> 20:57.134
That's about 8,000 U.S. dollars.

20:57.202 --> 20:58.836
Thank you so much.

20:58.904 --> 21:01.005
Enjoy your evening.

21:02.741 --> 21:04.108
Good as new.

21:04.176 --> 21:05.676
Let's play ball.

21:05.744 --> 21:06.644
High-low.

21:12.017 --> 21:13.684
Can I have another drink?

21:25.630 --> 21:26.830
Room's been searched.

21:26.898 --> 21:27.998
How'd we do?

21:28.066 --> 21:30.100
He was walking with happy feet.

21:30.168 --> 21:32.069
Well, you can do the happy dance too.

21:32.137 --> 21:33.537
You remember that woman
that shot at you today?

21:33.605 --> 21:36.073
Her prints match the wedding certificate

21:36.141 --> 21:37.841
of Donald Ridley's bride.

21:43.615 --> 21:44.782
Eight. Front line winner.

21:44.849 --> 21:47.885
Eight came easy, hard eights down.

21:47.953 --> 21:49.286
How much did you just lose?

21:49.354 --> 21:51.488
About $6,000. It'll turn around.

21:51.556 --> 21:54.658
Put it on snake eyes.

21:54.726 --> 21:55.993
Those are your last chips.

21:56.061 --> 21:58.796
Almost there.

21:58.863 --> 22:00.698
Isn't that a really risky bet?

22:00.765 --> 22:02.833
It pays 30 to 1.

22:02.901 --> 22:04.735
Because it doesn't come up much.

22:04.803 --> 22:06.170
You only have to hit
it once. Come on, baby.

22:06.238 --> 22:07.805
Give me the deuce.

22:11.076 --> 22:13.510
Snake eyes.

22:18.216 --> 22:19.483
Whoo!

22:19.551 --> 22:21.452
Pay the lady 30,000.

22:21.519 --> 22:22.853
Whoo!

22:22.921 --> 22:24.888
She won?

22:24.956 --> 22:26.423
What?

22:26.491 --> 22:27.791
She bet on snake eyes, and she won.

22:27.859 --> 22:29.960
Annie just won $30,000.

22:42.634 --> 22:45.002
Annie, that's $30,000.

22:45.069 --> 22:47.304
Did I tell you I was on a roll?

22:47.372 --> 22:50.407
That's almost what I make in a year.

22:50.475 --> 22:54.344
So how does she lose
30k gracefully now?

22:54.412 --> 22:55.512
Let's quit while you're ahead.

22:58.216 --> 23:00.851
Annie. Come on.

23:02.620 --> 23:08.058
No. Let it ride.

23:08.126 --> 23:10.160
- Madam?
- Same play.

23:10.228 --> 23:11.762
On the aces.

23:14.065 --> 23:17.634
You need to quit, Annie.

23:17.702 --> 23:18.835
There's no way I can lose.

23:18.903 --> 23:20.837
I can feel it.

23:20.905 --> 23:25.876
Then at least take
away a few thousand.

23:25.943 --> 23:28.712
Vivian, you got to
learn how to live a little.

23:28.780 --> 23:31.214
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

23:31.282 --> 23:33.884
There's no way I can lose.

23:36.688 --> 23:38.955
I'll be riding with the lucky lady.

24:00.378 --> 24:01.812
Seven out.

24:01.879 --> 24:06.149
Crowd: Awww!

24:06.217 --> 24:10.987
You can't be serious.

24:12.457 --> 24:14.725
May I see you for a moment?

24:21.966 --> 24:25.235
I'm afraid we only accept
personal checks from members.

24:25.303 --> 24:26.870
I understand.

24:26.938 --> 24:28.338
You need a cashier's check.

24:28.406 --> 24:30.807
For 8,000 U.S. dollars, yes.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.876
Until we have that,

24:32.944 --> 24:34.478
as miss Long can tell you,

24:34.545 --> 24:37.647
you will not be allowed
to leave the country.

24:46.457 --> 24:50.127
How could I be so stupid?

24:50.194 --> 24:51.695
$8,000.

24:51.763 --> 24:57.234
It may as well be a million.

24:57.301 --> 24:59.736
Maybe your parents can...

24:59.804 --> 25:02.339
My parents do not
have that kind of money.

25:02.406 --> 25:04.508
My sister's husband lost his job

25:04.575 --> 25:07.611
a few months ago, so they...

25:07.678 --> 25:09.012
They burnt through all their savings.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.614
I don't have anything.

25:10.681 --> 25:12.449
I don't have anyone to go to.

25:12.517 --> 25:14.417
I'm totally screwed.

25:14.485 --> 25:16.520
Oh, my God, and if I
can't leave the country,

25:16.587 --> 25:18.088
I'll probably lose my job.

25:18.156 --> 25:19.790
I mean, I have to tell
them why I can't come back.

25:19.857 --> 25:21.091
And my tooth hurts.

25:26.097 --> 25:31.334
If you're sure that
there's nothing you can do,

25:31.402 --> 25:33.203
I might have a solution.

25:36.774 --> 25:38.542
- The government?
- No.

25:38.609 --> 25:42.379
Not the government.

25:42.446 --> 25:44.581
And it's something you
probably shouldn't do.

25:46.517 --> 25:48.018
In fact, don't.

25:48.085 --> 25:49.553
Forget I mentioned it.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.954
No, no, tell me. Please.

25:51.022 --> 25:53.757
If there's a way to get
me out of this, tell me.

25:53.825 --> 25:55.725
It's not good, okay?

25:55.793 --> 25:58.495
It would involve
transporting certain things

25:58.563 --> 26:00.797
through customs using your
Smithsonian credentials.

26:00.865 --> 26:02.065
I'm sure you don't
want to risk...

26:02.133 --> 26:03.667
drugs?

26:03.734 --> 26:05.168
Not drugs.

26:05.236 --> 26:08.772
The goods would be shipped
in your Smithsonian crates...

26:08.840 --> 26:12.576
put in and removed on your
way to and from the airport.

26:12.643 --> 26:14.945
You'd never see or touch them.

26:15.012 --> 26:16.179
Who would I be working for?

26:16.247 --> 26:17.547
I can't tell you.

26:17.615 --> 26:20.584
But the people I'd hook you up with

26:20.651 --> 26:23.920
would pay off your debt.

26:23.988 --> 26:26.623
Thank you.

26:26.691 --> 26:28.058
Yes.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.759
Absolutely.

26:29.827 --> 26:31.661
Thank you so much, Vivian.

26:31.729 --> 26:33.597
Not so fast. I mean it.

26:33.664 --> 26:37.100
You've been drinking.
You're an emotional mess.

26:37.168 --> 26:39.336
You need to think about this.

26:39.403 --> 26:41.872
Sleep on it.

26:41.939 --> 26:44.608
Trust me. You shouldn't do this lightly.

26:44.675 --> 26:46.343
Okay?

26:46.410 --> 26:47.644
Look at me.

26:47.712 --> 26:49.112
Annie, I'm serious.

26:49.180 --> 26:51.882
Really make sure you want to do this.

26:51.949 --> 26:55.619
And then tell me tomorrow at the museum.

27:13.271 --> 27:16.706
She moved her purse
to her left shoulder.

27:16.774 --> 27:18.441
They approached her.

27:18.509 --> 27:21.511
She's in.

27:27.418 --> 27:28.618
Annie Walker.

27:28.686 --> 27:30.487
Oh, my God, you're still asleep.

27:30.554 --> 27:31.721
I can hear it in your voice.

27:31.789 --> 27:33.423
- Danielle?
- Yes, Danielle,

27:33.491 --> 27:35.959
your sister, standing
outside the Smithsonian

27:36.027 --> 27:37.494
with 30 third-graders, 2 teachers,

27:37.561 --> 27:38.628
and a couple mothers wondering

27:38.696 --> 27:39.562
why they won't let us in the museum.

27:39.630 --> 27:41.398
Okay, it's Thursday, right?

27:41.465 --> 27:42.732
What's wrong?

27:42.800 --> 27:44.734
Nobody seems to know
anything about this tour.

27:44.802 --> 27:47.470
I swear, they don't
even know who you are.

27:47.538 --> 27:49.773
Oh, no, I'm supposed to
be at the British museum

27:49.840 --> 27:51.408
in half an hour.

27:51.475 --> 27:52.943
Ah, my tooth.

27:53.010 --> 27:54.644
I don't care about your stupid tooth.

27:54.712 --> 27:56.313
Are you even listening to me?

27:56.380 --> 27:58.081
Yes, I am sorry, okay?

27:58.149 --> 27:59.382
I just... I don't know
what the screw-up is,

27:59.450 --> 28:01.451
but I will straighten it out, I promise.

28:01.519 --> 28:03.687
Just stay where you are.

28:03.754 --> 28:06.589
Smithsonian institute,
how may I direct your call?

28:06.657 --> 28:08.658
To someone who can
arrange for the tour

28:08.726 --> 28:10.760
I promised to my niece's
third-grade class.

28:10.828 --> 28:11.828
It seems a ball has been dropped,

28:11.896 --> 28:14.831
a very big ball,

28:14.899 --> 28:17.033
and they are standing
outside with nowhere to go,

28:17.101 --> 28:18.969
and I am late to an
extremely important meeting.

28:19.036 --> 28:23.506
This is why we say no to
these things, miss Walker.

28:23.574 --> 28:26.476
But you said yes, so we'll
have to take care of it.

28:26.544 --> 28:27.877
Soon?

28:27.945 --> 28:30.280
- Already in work.
- Thank you.

28:30.348 --> 28:32.248
And good luck with your meeting.

28:32.316 --> 28:35.385
Hey, this is Anderson up in the DPD.

28:35.453 --> 28:36.786
You know, it's funny.

28:36.854 --> 28:39.422
You guys answer your
phones, "cover operations,"

28:39.490 --> 28:40.957
so I would assume that your job

28:41.025 --> 28:43.226
is actually to provide
cover for our people.

28:43.294 --> 28:44.527
Is that right?

28:44.595 --> 28:46.930
It is.

28:46.998 --> 28:50.066
Then can you tell me
why Agent Walker's niece

28:50.134 --> 28:51.634
and her entire third-grade class

28:51.702 --> 28:54.137
are standing outside the Smithsonian

28:54.205 --> 28:57.040
right now wondering why
no one has arranged a tour?

28:57.108 --> 28:59.142
Alara Koman.

28:59.210 --> 29:01.745
She was trained by Turkish intelligence

29:01.812 --> 29:03.446
and is operating as a mercenary now,

29:03.514 --> 29:05.148
primarily in weapons trade,

29:05.216 --> 29:07.150
but we think she may have a hand
in human trafficking as well.

29:07.218 --> 29:08.785
Both of which can tie her to Angola.

29:08.853 --> 29:10.420
What about our vice-consul?

29:10.488 --> 29:12.155
We found a trail of visa applications

29:12.223 --> 29:13.323
that she approved without authorization.

29:13.391 --> 29:14.958
They all look like they were requests

29:15.026 --> 29:16.326
from Koman's organization.

29:16.394 --> 29:18.294
Vivian Long is up
to her neck in this.

29:18.362 --> 29:19.629
She could provide us with
some real information...

29:19.697 --> 29:21.264
names, places.

29:21.332 --> 29:22.732
Are you suggesting lip her?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.067
You can't.

29:24.135 --> 29:26.136
Who knows how she'll
react to an approach?

29:26.203 --> 29:28.772
Have to get your girl
Walker inside first.

29:28.839 --> 29:32.976
Viv!

29:33.044 --> 29:34.577
Sorry.

29:34.645 --> 29:36.980
I overslept, and I had
this thing with my sister.

29:37.048 --> 29:39.315
Did you think about it?

29:39.383 --> 29:40.617
Yes, I did.

29:40.684 --> 29:42.218
Before I give you an answer,

29:42.286 --> 29:44.154
can I ask you a question?

29:44.221 --> 29:45.288
Depends on what it is.

29:45.356 --> 29:47.490
Why are you doing this?

29:54.498 --> 29:57.300
Basically, you were right
when you called me a wonk.

29:57.368 --> 29:58.635
I mean, people like me,

29:58.702 --> 30:01.504
but guys don't see me in a certain way.

30:01.572 --> 30:03.473
In school, I was always the organizer,

30:03.541 --> 30:05.408
the best friend.

30:05.476 --> 30:07.610
I mean, when you walked
into Havery's last night,

30:07.678 --> 30:11.214
there was not a man in there
that wasn't checking you out.

30:11.282 --> 30:14.818
I...I always wanted
just a little of that.

30:14.885 --> 30:16.786
Turnbull.

30:19.857 --> 30:21.825
When we get together,
he's wonderful to me.

30:21.892 --> 30:23.726
A man that good-looking,

30:23.794 --> 30:26.996
to have him pay attention to me,

30:27.064 --> 30:28.465
to like me.

30:28.532 --> 30:31.000
What did he have you do?

30:31.068 --> 30:33.470
It started with a visa request.

30:33.537 --> 30:34.804
I helped it through.

30:34.872 --> 30:36.539
And then it just snowballed.

30:36.607 --> 30:39.709
Pretty soon, I couldn't get
out without losing my job.

30:39.777 --> 30:43.746
And I don't want to lose my job, Annie.

30:43.814 --> 30:45.115
It's all I've got.

30:45.182 --> 30:47.217
I don't want to lose my job either.

30:47.284 --> 30:50.787
But don't do it.

30:50.855 --> 30:52.122
It's a hole you can't dig out of.

30:52.189 --> 30:53.890
I'm already in a hole, Viv.

30:53.958 --> 30:55.825
This is my only way out.

30:55.893 --> 31:00.497
Well, then...

31:02.533 --> 31:05.335
Meet her there at 5:00.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.601
Hello, Annie.

31:21.838 --> 31:22.938
I hope you don't mind, but it's better

31:23.006 --> 31:24.339
if I don't give you my name.

31:24.407 --> 31:26.375
Oh.

31:26.442 --> 31:28.610
Thank you so much for helping me.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.112
Truly my pleasure.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.813
I am hoping we have a Long
and profitable relationship.

31:31.881 --> 31:33.682
Are you clear

31:33.750 --> 31:35.517
about what you're expected to do?

31:35.585 --> 31:36.685
Pretty much just look the other way?

31:36.753 --> 31:37.853
Exactly.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.288
The less you know, the better.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.490
When we have something
for you, we'll contact you.

31:41.557 --> 31:44.926
- Through Vivian.
- No, not through Vivian.

31:44.994 --> 31:46.228
We like to mix things up.

31:46.296 --> 31:47.829
Is that okay?

31:47.897 --> 31:49.231
Fine.

31:49.299 --> 31:50.799
You'll be paid with
a generous credit line

31:50.867 --> 31:52.000
at the casino.

31:52.068 --> 31:53.402
- I'm all for that.
- Good.

31:53.469 --> 31:55.103
I like your enthusiasm.

31:58.141 --> 32:03.645
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.980
Yes, her debt has been paid,

32:05.048 --> 32:06.281
and she's delighted to be on board.

32:06.349 --> 32:08.283
We were just having a chat.

32:21.130 --> 32:23.065
- Annie Walker.
- This museum's awesome.

32:23.132 --> 32:25.901
Auggie's better than Ben Stiller.

32:25.968 --> 32:27.502
Whoa, whoa, kids.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.339
Kids, my cane is not a light saber.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.308
We love Auggie. You guys
must have so much fun at work.

32:33.376 --> 32:35.744
Yeah, he's full of surprises

32:35.812 --> 32:36.912
and always there when you need him.

32:36.979 --> 32:38.013
And smart.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.114
Do you know he knows the names

32:39.182 --> 32:40.916
of 17 north American native tribes?

32:40.983 --> 32:41.983
Yes, he's very smart.

32:42.051 --> 32:43.418
Would you put him on?

32:43.486 --> 32:44.753
Oh, sure, sure. Auggie?

32:47.990 --> 32:49.491
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:49.559 --> 32:52.160
Promise me next time
you'll just say no.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.103
Thank you for this above and beyond.

33:01.170 --> 33:02.771
Are you headed back to the office now?

33:02.839 --> 33:06.274
Um, if we can get this
third grader off of my back.

33:06.342 --> 33:08.443
Hold on.

33:08.511 --> 33:12.547
Annie, you there?

33:12.615 --> 33:14.750
Do we need to talk?
Yeah, I need to speak

33:14.817 --> 33:16.017
to my friend at the embassy first.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.464
Hey, Viv.

33:29.532 --> 33:31.566
Hey, you. How was it?

33:31.634 --> 33:33.468
Fine. I really need to talk to you.

33:33.536 --> 33:34.703
Are you at the embassy?

33:34.771 --> 33:36.037
I'm just heading out.

33:36.105 --> 33:37.472
It's a big meeting.
Can it wait?

33:37.540 --> 33:39.040
I'm a little late already.

33:39.108 --> 33:40.876
It can't.
Well, it's important.

33:40.943 --> 33:42.310
So's this.

33:42.378 --> 33:44.813
Look, if you really need to talk,

33:44.881 --> 33:47.449
let's meet at the rose tattoo.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.217
It's a little pub in the
Camden warehouse district,

33:49.285 --> 33:51.186
but it's kind of local,

33:51.254 --> 33:53.221
so you don't want to
order cosmos or martinis.

33:53.289 --> 33:56.091
Vivian, I... - I got
to run. See you there.

34:08.137 --> 34:09.804
Excuse me.

34:09.871 --> 34:14.376
Could you pull over at the next corner?

34:14.444 --> 34:16.311
Thank you.

34:19.782 --> 34:22.016
It's Annie on her
encrypted cell, line seven.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.619
We're on with Jai and
Roach. We'll patch her in.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.719
Join us. Annie?

34:25.788 --> 34:27.489
They're gonna get rid of Vivian.

34:29.132 --> 34:30.766
How do you know?

34:30.833 --> 34:32.201
I met with the
woman who's running it.

34:32.268 --> 34:34.103
Pretty, brunette, 35.

34:34.170 --> 34:36.038
Alara Koman, Ridley's wife.

34:36.106 --> 34:37.672
She didn't know I spoke Turkish.

34:37.741 --> 34:39.375
I didn't know you speak Turkish.

34:39.443 --> 34:40.643
Enough to get by.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.110
They think she knows too much.

34:42.179 --> 34:44.647
They're worried about her being flipped.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.382
Where is she?

34:46.449 --> 34:47.949
At the embassy when
I last talked to her.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.784
Jai, see if she's
still in the building.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.053
No, she was on her way out

34:51.121 --> 34:53.155
to a meeting in Camden,
the warehouse district.

34:53.223 --> 34:54.857
I'm gonna meet her after at a pub.

34:54.925 --> 34:56.759
No, forget the pub. You're
looking for a gray warehouse.

34:56.827 --> 34:58.494
1218 Brewery Road.

34:58.562 --> 35:00.396
Annie, how much did you tell her?

35:00.464 --> 35:01.697
Nothing until I called you.

35:01.765 --> 35:02.965
Good girl.

35:03.033 --> 35:03.933
We make any move to save her,

35:04.001 --> 35:05.134
we're tipping our hand.

35:05.202 --> 35:06.602
They'll kill her.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.204
I'm perfectly aware
that this young woman

35:08.271 --> 35:10.506
is an American citizen
and have no desire

35:10.574 --> 35:12.041
to put her in harm's
way, but anything we do

35:12.109 --> 35:13.576
at this point

35:13.644 --> 35:15.411
will jeopardize the
operation with Walker.

35:15.479 --> 35:16.879
It's not your call, Henry.

35:16.947 --> 35:18.547
Why do you think I'm here, Arthur?

35:18.615 --> 35:20.149
You're here because
you lobbied the director

35:20.217 --> 35:21.450
to put you here.

35:21.518 --> 35:22.652
The only way you're
gonna shed any light

35:22.719 --> 35:23.919
on this Angola connection

35:23.987 --> 35:26.155
is to get someone inside.

35:26.223 --> 35:28.391
Vivian Long has real information

35:28.458 --> 35:30.192
for us now, not months from now.

35:30.260 --> 35:31.694
She's burned.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.330
We can't jeopardize Walker's mission.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.265
- I'm already in.
- And we want to keep you in.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.634
What if this Koman woman
is trying to flush you out?

35:38.702 --> 35:40.236
Did you think of that?

35:40.303 --> 35:42.905
Why is she meeting Vivian at
a place we've been watching?

35:42.973 --> 35:44.373
She's baiting us.

35:44.441 --> 35:47.209
You make a move, you reveal who you are.

35:51.381 --> 35:53.315
Jai, have the marines

35:53.383 --> 35:54.750
hold miss Long at the door.

35:54.818 --> 35:56.419
You're a fool, Arthur.

35:56.486 --> 35:57.687
And you're not wanted here, Henry.

35:57.754 --> 35:59.355
Get out of the room.

35:59.423 --> 36:02.024
Vivian left the
embassy ten minutes ago.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.726
Then get her. And go armed.

36:03.794 --> 36:06.395
Annie, Jai and
Roach are on their way.

36:06.463 --> 36:07.997
Do nothing until they get there.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.265
Yes, ma'am.

36:09.332 --> 36:10.466
Nothing.

36:10.534 --> 36:13.169
Camden, 1218 Brewery Road.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.118
- Hello, Vivian.
- Patricia.

36:29.186 --> 36:31.120
Or maybe I should call you Elena now.

36:31.188 --> 36:32.755
You're gonna have to get used to it.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.423
Sorry about the
last minute of it all.

36:34.491 --> 36:37.093
You've been wonderful.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.061
Passport still needs a signature.

36:39.129 --> 36:41.464
You look amazing in
your picture, by the way.

36:41.531 --> 36:42.732
My passport photo looks like my butt.

36:46.803 --> 36:49.171
So I heard you closed the club down.

36:49.239 --> 36:51.273
We've had to adjust a few things.

36:51.341 --> 36:53.576
- You like Annie?
- Very much.

36:53.643 --> 36:56.212
She's perfect for us.
I know.

36:56.279 --> 36:59.248
I just wish she didn't have to do this.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.175
Hands behind your head, please.

37:33.774 --> 37:36.575
Annie, I thought we
were gonna meet at the pub.

37:38.211 --> 37:39.478
Any others?

37:39.546 --> 37:42.081
She's alone.

37:42.149 --> 37:44.016
Not for Long. Asser,
get back outside.

37:44.084 --> 37:45.584
We need to move quickly.

37:45.652 --> 37:46.952
Jonathan, what's going on?

37:48.588 --> 37:50.890
Patricia?
Your friend speaks Turkish,

37:50.957 --> 37:52.825
Vivian.

37:52.893 --> 37:54.794
I thought you were listening.

37:54.861 --> 37:57.096
I could see it in your eyes.

37:57.164 --> 37:59.665
You were really very good until then.

37:59.733 --> 38:02.535
Excellent.

38:07.073 --> 38:08.240
Annie?

38:08.308 --> 38:10.442
I'm one of the
basement people, Vivian.

38:10.510 --> 38:11.944
We got flushed out.

38:12.012 --> 38:14.547
Oh, my God.

38:14.614 --> 38:16.682
On your knees, ladies.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.885
No, Jonathan.

38:19.953 --> 38:21.720
Sorry, Viv.

38:21.788 --> 38:24.657
You really are a very sweet girl.

38:24.724 --> 38:27.159
Hey!

38:27.227 --> 38:29.061
My tooth!

38:32.032 --> 38:33.365
Annie! Up here!

38:55.822 --> 38:56.856
Down here! There's a way out!

39:01.995 --> 39:03.462
She's down.

39:06.566 --> 39:08.100
Vivian!

39:08.168 --> 39:09.501
Too much fire. Wait it out.

39:12.138 --> 39:13.172
Annie!

39:13.240 --> 39:14.373
Let's go.

39:19.846 --> 39:21.914
There's the stairway.
Get her out of here.

40:05.926 --> 40:08.527
A life saved, a mission blown.

40:08.595 --> 40:10.462
You just lost a huge
opportunity, Arthur.

40:10.530 --> 40:12.531
Not according to the director, Henry.

40:12.599 --> 40:14.199
Apparently, you don't have clearance

40:14.267 --> 40:15.601
for his morning briefing,
but the Angola chatter's

40:15.669 --> 40:16.602
gone quiet.

40:16.670 --> 40:17.903
Alara Koman's dead.

40:17.971 --> 40:19.872
Vivian Long knows far
more than we thought.

40:19.940 --> 40:22.474
And we're getting very good
intel from the men Jai captured.

40:22.542 --> 40:23.742
You should be proud of him.

40:23.810 --> 40:26.011
Optimism weakens any equation.

40:26.079 --> 40:28.714
You should know that.

40:28.782 --> 40:30.983
Pessimism kills the
equation before it starts.

40:31.051 --> 40:32.618
You look better with your beard.

40:32.686 --> 40:34.620
Grow it back, Henry.

40:39.025 --> 40:40.826
Get some sleep last night?

40:40.894 --> 40:42.127
Well, I still have
plenty to worry about.

40:42.195 --> 40:43.662
There's the Liza Hearn leak.

40:43.730 --> 40:46.432
Ben Mercer's still out
there cowboying around.

40:46.499 --> 40:50.002
Well, maybe you should
sleep in the master tonight.

40:50.070 --> 40:53.272
I was thinking of retiring early.

40:58.845 --> 41:01.680
Flight 117 Dublin, business class...

41:04.851 --> 41:06.618
They fly you business?

41:06.686 --> 41:08.754
Coach.

41:08.822 --> 41:11.156
When they turn off the seatbelt sign,

41:11.224 --> 41:13.492
I'll come back and visit.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.461
That's us, Vivian.

41:18.765 --> 41:20.399
Dii ever tell you
I wanted to be a spy?

41:20.467 --> 41:22.534
It was in your file.

41:24.871 --> 41:27.272
Now I'm kind of glad I didn't get in.

41:27.340 --> 41:29.608
It's no fun leading
a double life, is it?

41:29.676 --> 41:34.279
I mean, the lying and deception.

41:34.347 --> 41:38.217
Whatever happens now,
my wonky life is my own.

41:38.284 --> 41:42.688
And that's a relief.

42:04.144 --> 42:05.744
Sounds like you've
had a change of heart.

42:05.812 --> 42:07.413
What happened to my masochist?

42:07.480 --> 42:09.748
She's gone, Auggie.

42:09.816 --> 42:11.250
Disappeared.

42:11.317 --> 42:14.086
Have a dentist at the gate when I land.

42:15.305 --> 42:21.922
