- FEMALE REPORTER: You're
saying that the President

00:02.269 --> 00:04.103
is responsible for the
death of a prostitute.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.537
- That is exactly
what I'm saying.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.340
- MALE: Previously on The Oval.

00:10.578 --> 00:11.910

outta there.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.645
- Jason.
The doctors are comin'.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.982
- The thought of being in
pain actually brings me joy.

00:16.984 --> 00:17.916
- We have Kyle.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.251

00:19.253 --> 00:20.719

00:22.390 --> 00:23.255

00:26.994 --> 00:29.695
- She is so full of shit, man.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.599
- Put her in this chair.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.768
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.706
Now, I need you guys to get
the White House doctor quick.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.307
Close the door.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.818
They're gone.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.622
- How was it?

00:56.624 --> 00:58.323
- Wicked.

00:59.894 --> 01:03.095
- We are not leaving
this White House.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.640
- MAN: Ladies and Gentlemen,
the president and first lady.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.433
- Thank you.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.414
- So?

01:57.351 --> 01:59.885
- Ma'am?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.987
- How did I do?

02:01.989 --> 02:07.025
- Oh, you were great, Ma'am.

02:07.027 --> 02:11.396
- I know that, but
how did I look?

02:11.398 --> 02:17.136
- Ooh, well, you, you
looked like you always do.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.839
- And what does that mean?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.309
- You were flawless.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.615
- Not too much?
- No. No.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.916
- Good.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.852
I was trying to
look a bit disheveled.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.521
- Well, it worked.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.591
- Did I come across
as a caring mother?

02:39.593 --> 02:42.027
- I was strangely convinced.

02:42.029 --> 02:46.598
- Hmm, are you being sarcastic?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.734
- No. No, not at all.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.236
- Good,
because now is not the time

02:51.238 --> 02:54.773
for one of your
little jealous fits.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.708
- Jealous?

02:56.710 --> 02:59.077
- Yes, bitch.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.146
You know you wanna be me.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.483
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah you're right.

03:04.485 --> 03:08.320
No, that, that right there,
that is my waking dream.

03:08.322 --> 03:12.257
To be you that is, right?
Hmm?

03:12.259 --> 03:13.792
- Go to hell.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.662
- I'm pretty sure
I'm already there.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.332
- What's online?

03:25.072 --> 03:29.274
- Oh, you and your husband
are trending.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.209
- In a good way?

03:30.211 --> 03:34.513
- It's too early
to know right now.

03:34.515 --> 03:38.650
- Well, I laid the foundation.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.752
I can't do it all.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.654
- Yes ma'am, I'm aware.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.391
- Now, I need you to assemble
one hell of a crisis team

03:46.393 --> 03:49.428
to work with our staff
and make this stick.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.396
- I am on it.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.599
- And Donald?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.667
- Yes, ma'am.

03:55.669 --> 03:59.204
- Don't ever question me again.

03:59.206 --> 04:03.609
- Ma'am, if this works,
trust me I never will.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.312
- Where's that boy?

04:07.314 --> 04:09.414
- Boy?

04:09.416 --> 04:13.418
- Your assistant with
the hard high butt.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.088
- You mean Allen?

04:16.090 --> 04:18.056
- You like his butt don't you?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.459
- Okay, ma'am,
I wish you would stop.

04:20.461 --> 04:24.696
- Aw, just come on out of
the closet already, honey.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.398
- Are we done here?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.935
- My, look how
uncomfortable we get

04:29.937 --> 04:31.536
when confronted with the truth.

04:31.538 --> 04:36.742
- Okay, ma'am, this is
very unprofessional.

04:36.744 --> 04:40.012
- You know he'll
never want you right?

04:40.014 --> 04:41.947
- Who's that?

04:41.949 --> 04:42.948
- My husband.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.451
- [snickers]

04:46.453 --> 04:50.322
Ma'am trust me when I tell you
I do not want your husband.

04:50.324 --> 04:54.893
- Hmm, he has a serious
sexual addiction

04:54.895 --> 04:56.328
but it's only for women.

04:56.330 --> 05:01.333
- Oh, I'm, I'm
fully, fully aware.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.502
- And that little boy
who works for you.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.370
- Yes?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.571
- He's so whipped

05:06.573 --> 05:09.274
he couldn't tell that girl
was no good for him.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.376
So, you don't stand a chance.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.312
- Well, perhaps you
should be more concerned

05:13.314 --> 05:17.082
about your own son,
who's in the hospital, hmm?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.851
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.087
- I'll get to him.

05:22.089 --> 05:26.892
But first, I need to find
the perfect, I'm sad, dress

05:26.894 --> 05:28.994
to go to the hospital in.

05:28.996 --> 05:33.298
- Oh, you should get to that.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.804
- Maybe I should call your wife.

05:38.806 --> 05:44.242
And, wait, you, you don't
know where she is, do you?

05:44.244 --> 05:46.144
- You know what, ma'am,
can I, can I get that,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.680
that door right
there for you, hmm?

05:48.682 --> 05:49.781
- [snickers]

05:49.783 --> 05:52.184
- Hmm.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.689
- Nah, honey, I got it.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.065
- You bitch, oh...

06:09.903 --> 06:11.370
- Barry.
- Yo?

06:11.372 --> 06:15.540
- Barry, you can't
talk about this.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.376
- Yeah, you told me.
- Barry, I mean it.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.345
- Yeah, I heard you, Dad.
- Okay.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.347
- But can you tell me
if I'm right, please?

06:22.349 --> 06:27.319
- Barry.
- No, Dad, I know what I saw.

06:27.321 --> 06:30.956
- The less you know, the better.
- Just tell me.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.425
- I'm not telling you
for your own good.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.261
- What about, what about
Sharon's own good.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.929
- Son, she'll be fine.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.231
- How can you say
she'll be fine

06:39.233 --> 06:40.866
when you know what
happened to Denise?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.467
- Son, I know that but--

06:42.469 --> 06:44.903
- There's ain't no buts.
This is serious.

06:44.905 --> 06:49.040
- I know. Now, look, you have to
trust what I'm telling you.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.909
- Well, I'm trying to trust you.
- NANCY: Richard?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.378
- Uh, yeah.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.180
Look, I, I, I don't
want your momma

06:55.182 --> 06:57.182
to know nothing about this.
- NANCY: Richard?

06:57.184 --> 06:59.050
- Okay, fine.
- Alright, but I mean it.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.019
- I got you.
- NANCY: I'm in here. Come see.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.256
- O-okay.
- We still gotta tell her.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.692
- What, what is it?
- Look.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.862
- And we're told that the
First Son, Jason Franklin

07:10.864 --> 07:14.866
tried to -- on the heels of the
Vice President's announcement

07:14.868 --> 07:18.336
of the investigation into the
President and First Lady.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.405
He accused them of
trying to cover up crimes

07:20.407 --> 07:22.541
that involve two dead women.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.310
As we're standing outside the
hospital here, we are told

07:25.312 --> 07:27.746
that the President's
motorcade just arrived,

07:27.748 --> 07:31.683
although he arrived not to
long ago by Marine One.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.618
Back to you John.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.389
- What happened?

07:37.391 --> 07:39.925
- I heard it on the radio too.
They said he tried to --.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.462
- Dang, this boy.
- Is he okay?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.496
- I can't.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.631
- You know he
can't tell us, Mom.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.568
He can't seem to tell
us anything these days.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.405
- Barry.

07:55.209 --> 08:00.045
- What's wrong with him?
- It's, it's, it's alright.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.447
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.549
- Okay, well, I kept your
dinner warm for you.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.717
- Okay.

08:05.719 --> 08:11.122
- Oh, and, um,
I talked to Priscilla.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.491
- What did she say?

08:12.493 --> 08:15.660
- She said that she is
not taking any time off

08:15.662 --> 08:18.129
and that she will do
what she has to do.

08:18.131 --> 08:22.367
- [sighs] What does that mean?

08:22.369 --> 08:25.437
- Richard,
she told me everything.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.972
- Damn.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.241
- Maybe you need to
just suspend her.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.476
- Nancy, I'm not her boss.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.746
- Well, then go to her boss.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.314
- That would not be smart.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.649
- Okay, so, you're
just gonna wait

08:37.651 --> 08:41.553
until she does
something stupid.

08:41.555 --> 08:46.124
- I'll talk to Sam.
- Really, run to Sam?

08:46.126 --> 08:48.159
[laughs] He oughta be tired.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.562
- Yeah, well we all are.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.899
- Well, come on.
Let me feed you.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.111
- Agent Kyle Flint.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.179
- What the hell, Sam?

09:08.181 --> 09:11.416
- I need to talk to you.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.184
- Who else knows I'm down here?

09:13.186 --> 09:16.855
- Kyle, you might
want to listen.

09:16.857 --> 09:21.559
- You let me out of here and
you let me out of here now.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.029
- I need to talk to you first.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.331
- [spits]

09:26.333 --> 09:28.566
I ain't saying shit to you.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.036
Where the hell is Donald?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.837
- Now.
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

09:32.839 --> 09:36.308
You let me out of here, Sam.
I need to talk to Donald.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.510
- And I am talking to you.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.679
- You're going to jail.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.581
You hear me?
You are going to jail.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.582
- Kyle.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.218
- Th-th-this is kidnapping.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.120
- I have you in here
on a federal warrant.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.789
- This is bullshit.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.491
- Signed by the Vice President.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.464
- Does Donald know this?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.633
- The Chief of Staff is unaware.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.836
- [sighs]

10:05.572 --> 10:08.273
So, what's your plan then, Sam?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.808
Hmm?

10:09.810 --> 10:12.644
How long you gonna
keep me down here?

10:12.646 --> 10:17.749
- That depends on what
the Vice President finds.

10:17.751 --> 10:21.086
- Are you -- stupid?
- Kyle.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.254
- You just wait

10:23.256 --> 10:27.292
until Donald
finds out about this.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.827
- You're awfully
comfortable with him.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.364
- That's because I'm -- him.
- Come again.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.933
- Yeah.

10:34.935 --> 10:39.938
That's what he says to
me over and over again.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.542
- That explains a lot.

10:44.544 --> 10:49.014
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, okay, Sam.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.350
So, what else you wanna know?

10:52.352 --> 10:57.522
- Mm, what I really
wanna know

10:57.524 --> 11:00.959
is why you shot
agents Max and Yuma.

11:05.732 --> 11:09.601
- You think anything that I say
is gonna be used against me?

11:09.603 --> 11:13.204
- Yes it will.
- This is bullshit.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.040
You can't--

11:16.343 --> 11:19.978
The Vice President
has no authority.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.646
- He does.

11:22.516 --> 11:26.751
- Okay, okay.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.120
What do you wanna know Sam?

11:29.122 --> 11:31.256
- Everything.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.757
- Okay.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.325
Okay.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.629
Well, I'm gonna
tell you everything

11:37.631 --> 11:42.400
just to show you
how stupid you are.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.103
- Proceed.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.971
- Let me start with
you not understanding

11:46.973 --> 11:49.474
how this works, Sam.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.342
The President is in the pocket

11:51.344 --> 11:53.611
of every major
global corporation.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.580
They don't want him to work.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.549
They don't want him to be smart.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.951
They don't want
him in the office.

11:59.953 --> 12:04.856
They wanna make their deals
an have him sign them.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.393
You're not up against him, Sam.
He is not your problem.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.330
And if you think that those
kinds of trillions of dollars

12:12.332 --> 12:14.099
are not going to
be your downfall,

12:14.101 --> 12:17.068
then you are a damn fool.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.274
- So, that's what you
wanted to tell me?

12:23.276 --> 12:26.244
- That's all I'm telling you.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.614
- Okay.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.723
- And Sam.
- Yes?

12:38.725 --> 12:43.528
- When I get out of here,
and I will get out of here,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.763
you and your wife--

12:45.765 --> 12:48.266
- Be careful.
- And everything that you love

12:48.268 --> 12:52.604
will rue the day
that you met me.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.172
- Yeah, okay.

12:56.009 --> 13:01.179
Well, I should
have you know that

13:03.650 --> 13:06.251
I just couldn't be
responsible for you.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.619
- Oh, -- your reason.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.720
- Yeah, okay.

13:08.722 --> 13:12.290
- You let me out of here.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.359
- See you.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.427
- Okay, well,
you just wait

13:16.429 --> 13:19.164
until Donald realizes
that I'm not around.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.331
You just wait.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.167
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.935
- Have a good night.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.203
- Sam.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.340
Sam!

13:43.223 --> 13:44.789
- [sighs]

13:51.364 --> 13:52.630
Alright.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.734
- Oh.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.837
- Are you okay?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.073
- I think I need to lay down.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.443
- Okay, yeah, you probably
over did it today.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.879
- Yeah.
- Sit down.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.814
- Dale, why don't I help
you to your room, brother?

14:09.816 --> 14:13.051
- No thanks, I'll just, I'll
just sit here for a minute.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.455
- [phone vibrates]

14:17.457 --> 14:18.723
- Poor thing.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.192
- [phone vibrating]

14:21.194 --> 14:24.162
- I'll make some food.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.430
- Hello?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.864
- DONALD: Is he there?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.433
- What?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.069
- DONALD: Is he there?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.503
- Who is this?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.905
- DONALD: Let me
tell you something.

14:33.907 --> 14:38.142
If I find out that he's there--
- No, he's not here.

14:38.144 --> 14:43.181
- DONALD: Are you lying to me?
- No, I swear, he's, he's not.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.215
- DONALD: Okay.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.883
- I haven't even spoken
to him since we--

14:45.885 --> 14:47.252
- DONALD: Oh yeah, he's there.
- I'm--

14:47.254 --> 14:49.354
- DONALD: And let me let you
know that you are both--

14:49.356 --> 14:50.355
- No, he's not.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.794
- Dale, who was that?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.365
- SHARON: Was that him?

15:00.367 --> 15:03.368
- Yeah.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.738
- Him, who is, who is him?

15:06.740 --> 15:09.707
Would somebody tell me
what's going on, please?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.045
- The Chief of Staff
at the White House

15:14.047 --> 15:18.116
is apparently in love
with that, that agent guy

15:18.118 --> 15:23.187
and, um, he had me shot
with non lethal rounds,

15:23.189 --> 15:24.889
as a warning.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.395
- [laughs]

15:31.965 --> 15:33.464
What?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.334
- Yeah.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.737
- No, you guys
can't be serious.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.407
- It's the truth.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.910
- How do you know?

15:45.912 --> 15:49.280
- That same agent
came to the store.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.450
He took me to the President.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.454
- What?

15:56.456 --> 16:00.325
- Yeah. To the Oval Office.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.860
- Sharon, what are you saying?

16:02.862 --> 16:04.462
- That's exactly
what I'm saying.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.031
He came to the
store, kidnapped me,

16:07.033 --> 16:11.736
and brought me to the
President against my will.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.838
- Baby, you're telling me

16:13.840 --> 16:18.009
that the President of
the United States kidnapped you.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.944
- Yes.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.780
- Sharon, come on.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.782
- See, that's why I
didn't wanna tell you.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.417
- Yeah, we know
it sounds insane.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.519
- Yeah, it does.

16:28.521 --> 16:32.357
- But they're really drunk with
power and really dangerous.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.527
- This is--
- Look, you wanted to know.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.730
Now you know what's going on.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.500
- I need a drink.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.068
- Yeah, so do I.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.903
- I'll pour.

16:45.905 --> 16:49.640
- How you gonna pour? Sit down.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.809
- Okay.
- Alright, I'll get it.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.655
- You guys are serious?

17:04.657 --> 17:05.857
- Yes.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.259
- We're not lying
to you about this.

17:10.964 --> 17:15.867
- Okay, so, we're in danger?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.570
- Yeah, we think so.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.007
- Alright, well,
let's go to the police.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.909
- No.
- Why not?

17:24.911 --> 17:26.611
- That's the worst
thing we could do.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.613
- Dale, come on. Sharon?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.548
- No, we can't.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.889
- Okay, what? So, then we just,
we just sit right here?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.024
- Well, where else
are we supposed to go?

17:40.026 --> 17:42.360
The police cannot help
us in this situation.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.095
- Great.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.763
Great, so, we'll,
we'll just wait.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.999
We'll just drink and
wait for the President

17:48.001 --> 17:50.401
to come kidnap you
and for some crazy guy

17:50.403 --> 17:52.069
to just shoot Dale again.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.239
- No, I'm, I'm talking
to Mr. Richard about it.

17:55.241 --> 17:58.376
- You talking to Mr. Richard?
- Yes.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.544
- That's great.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.879
He's a butler.
- Kareem.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.181
- No, what's he
gonna do, Sharon?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.916
He's gonna stab 'em
with a butter knife?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.685
- No, he, he's talking
to the Secret Service.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.287
- Sharon.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.355
- Look, they'll
never believe us.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.091
Look, at us, we're poor.
We don't have anything.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.194
Well, at least I don't.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.863
- We have to do something.
- No, she's right.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.998
You need to listen to her.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.570
- You two are that scared?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.772
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.907
- Okay, well, I'm not.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.110
- Well, you should be.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.847
- I need that drink.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.448
- Here you go.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.960
- I'm going on a walk.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.062
- What? No.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.664
- Yeah, I gotta, this
is, this is a lot.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.367
Uh, I just gotta go on a walk.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.503
- Kareem, don't.

18:58.505 --> 19:02.540
- No, Sharon, I, I,
I'm gonna sort it out.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.808
I gotta clear my head.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.376
- Kareem.
- It's okay.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.546
- No, where are you going?
- It's alright, just stay here.

19:16.556 --> 19:20.291
- We shouldn't have told him.
- I told you that.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.492
- Damn.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.928
- [laughing] You see?
- Allen.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.831
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, I know you see this.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.232
- Yeah.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.901
- So, you know that this
is too coincidental.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.938
- Look, I get that, but--

19:33.940 --> 19:35.439
- But what, man?

19:35.441 --> 19:36.974
Are you watching
what I'm watching?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.409
You're trained in this shit.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.144
You, you know I'm
not going crazy.

19:40.146 --> 19:45.282
- Look, all I'm gonna say
is that all this is not right.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.618
- Alright, you think?

19:47.620 --> 19:51.589
- But it's hard to
believe that she did it.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.524
- Come on, man.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.993
She did it.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.863
- You don't have the proof.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.165
- Okay, hear me out, alright?

20:01.167 --> 20:02.633
You can get it.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.268
- And how can I do that?

20:04.270 --> 20:05.870
- You were assigned
to that detail, right?

20:05.872 --> 20:09.073
- No, I was on to her son.

20:09.075 --> 20:12.009
- That crazy bastard
will tell you.

20:12.011 --> 20:16.714
- And how is he gonna do
that in intensive care?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.082
- Mmm.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.518
Damn it man, come on, think.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.621
We gotta believe
we can do this.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.790
- Look, man,
- Please.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.324
- I--
- Come on.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.827
- I'm gonna go, okay?

20:32.799 --> 20:34.665
- Are you sure?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.272
- You scared, man.

20:41.274 --> 20:45.509
- Nah, oh come, nah, nah, nah.

20:45.511 --> 20:49.246
- I'm gonna go home to my girl.

20:50.683 --> 20:54.051
- Hey, please man?

20:54.053 --> 20:55.419
Please?

20:58.724 --> 21:00.691
Please?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.426
[sighs]

21:08.901 --> 21:10.634
- Here.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.136
- Thank you.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.472
Thank you.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.642
- And I want it back.
- Yes. You got it.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.180
- When are you coming to work?

21:23.182 --> 21:25.382
- I don't know, man.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.152
- Okay.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.321
I'll be there all day.

21:30.323 --> 21:33.757
I'm gonna check in on you
and you better not have that.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.893
- Ugh, Alonzo, come on, man.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.429
I'm not gonna have it.
You know me.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.765
- I think I do.
- Alonzo.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.335
- Don't make me regret this.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.971
- Really? You're not gonna
regret it, damn.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.240
- Okay.

21:49.242 --> 21:51.742
I'll see you.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.044
- [sighs]

21:54.046 --> 21:57.281
Hey.

21:57.283 --> 22:00.885
Thanks for coming in, man.

22:00.887 --> 22:04.555
- Yeah, sorry about Ellie.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.494
- Yeah, me too.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.433
- I'll see you.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.788
- Come to bed.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.256
- I can't sleep.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.193
- There's nothing we can do.
It's out there now.

22:42.195 --> 22:46.964
- I know that but--.
- But nothing.

22:46.966 --> 22:50.534
- Aren't you seeing this?
- What?

22:50.536 --> 22:55.272
- All the, all the calls
we're getting for comment.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.675
- Oh my god, people
won't believe them.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.144
- They are Simone.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.213
- Well, why didn't
they get their son help,

23:02.215 --> 23:03.514
if it was that bad, hmm?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.616
- I know.
- No, no, no, no.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.185
That's the questions that
they should be asking.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.854
- I know that.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.490
- Well, I'm gonna make sure
that every legitimate outlet

23:13.492 --> 23:15.960
does ask those questions.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.895
- And I hear you.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.835
- Look, we have
them on the ropes.

23:24.837 --> 23:29.006
All we have to do
is keep the pressure on.

23:31.310 --> 23:35.212
- You know they're
gonna get rid of me.

23:35.214 --> 23:41.018
- Eli, you are going to
be the next President.

23:41.887 --> 23:46.657
Okay? I assure you.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.992
So, just relax.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.261
- I'm trying to.

23:50.263 --> 23:54.465
- Mm, come to bed.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.667
- We need to have a plan.

23:56.669 --> 24:01.772
- And after a good night's
rest we will have a plan.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.408
- They are so evil.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.911
- Hmm, I know and they
don't deserve the office.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.548
We got this. You know it.

24:11.550 --> 24:15.452
- Simone--
- No, look,

24:16.956 --> 24:19.256
they threatened our children.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.659
Okay?

24:21.661 --> 24:27.398
That low down dirty bitch is
evil and we will take her down.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.702
We're going to prevail.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.671
We will.

24:33.673 --> 24:34.838
Hmm?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.307
- Okay.

24:36.309 --> 24:40.644
- Now, come, hmm?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.013
- You go on, babe,
I'll be up in a minute.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.882
- Okay.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.261
- No.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.730
[gasping]

24:59.732 --> 25:01.332
- It's alright.
It's okay. I'm here.

25:01.334 --> 25:04.468
- I--
- I know. I know.

25:04.470 --> 25:09.473
- Uh, uh, it was so real.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.909
- I know it was.

25:12.778 --> 25:13.777
- Damn.

25:13.779 --> 25:14.745
- [sighs]

25:14.747 --> 25:16.246
- Ugh.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.948
- It's okay.

25:17.950 --> 25:21.151
- Oh, I can't believe
he did that to me.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.553
- You're safe now.

25:22.555 --> 25:27.524
- Ugh, it's alright, I just,
I think I need some air.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.526
I just, I need some air.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.562
- No.
- Damn, come on, now.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.896
- Lily, don't, don't
go near the window.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.132
- Look, I just, I just need
some air, Bobby, okay?

25:35.134 --> 25:36.400
And that's all
I need right now.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.036
- Just breathe. Okay? Breathe.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.671
- [knock at door]

25:40.673 --> 25:43.807
- MAX: Is she okay?
- Nightmares.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.442
- MAX: Can you blame her,
sleeping with your ass?

25:45.444 --> 25:48.545
- Will you go to bed?

25:52.318 --> 25:54.785
Here.
- No, no, I'm, I'm okay.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.587
No, I'm okay.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.533
- I know this is hard for you.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.902
- Do you Bobby?
- Yes.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.305
- No, 'cause my, my whole life
has been turned upside down.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.908
- I know.
- No, you don't.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.910
Okay, because I, I thought
that he was the one.

26:19.912 --> 26:23.347
I thought that he was the
answer to just getting me away.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.182
- I'm sorry.
- And protecting me.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.650
- I'm sorry.

26:26.652 --> 26:31.355
- No, it's, uh, it's okay
because if I didn't meet him

26:31.357 --> 26:33.023
then I wouldn't have
met you and then I just--

26:33.025 --> 26:35.492
- That's true.
- I just wouldn't feel this way.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.194
- Lilly, just come
back and lay down. Alright?

26:37.196 --> 26:39.863
- Oh my god. Do I have to listen
to this right now?

26:39.865 --> 26:42.099
- Will you go to sleep?
- I'm trying to.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.601
You guys are writing a damn
romance novel in there.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.103
- Yeah, I, I'm sorry.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.172
- It's okay.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.475
- Okay, I just, uh, I, um.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.876
I, I just can't--
- Come back to bed.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.446
- I just can't sleep.
- Please. Come on.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.483
Come on, come on.

27:03.556 --> 27:09.159
- You, um, you didn't want
me to go to the window. Why?

27:09.161 --> 27:13.330
- It's for your safety.

27:13.332 --> 27:18.268
- Okay, I, um.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.071
- Come back to bed.

27:21.073 --> 27:25.042
- Okay, okay.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.677
Okay.

27:29.715 --> 27:33.217
- Look, Max and I are here,
alright, you're fine.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.818
I assure you.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.425
It'll be back to normal soon.
It really will.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.961
I assure you.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.096
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.165
- Come to bed.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.136
- I, uh--
- Come on. Come on.

27:53.138 --> 27:54.671
- [sighs]

27:58.377 --> 28:01.912
Okay, I'll try to rest.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.017
- Yeah.

28:39.702 --> 28:41.168
- So you wanna
report a kidnapping?

28:41.170 --> 28:43.070
- Yes.
- Okay, by who?

28:43.072 --> 28:46.640
- Well, it was, uh, my
girlfriend, she was taken.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.342
- And do you have any
idea where she is?

28:48.344 --> 28:50.277
- Well, she's at home now.

28:50.279 --> 28:52.012
- Okay, but she was kidnapped?

28:52.014 --> 28:53.413
- Yes.

28:53.415 --> 28:54.781
- Look, when was this?

28:54.783 --> 28:56.883
- It was the other day.

28:56.885 --> 28:58.485
- And she's home now?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.354
- Yes, thank god.

29:00.356 --> 29:05.058
- Okay, um, who did it?

29:05.060 --> 29:08.061
- Okay, well, she,
uh, she was, um--

29:08.063 --> 29:10.664
- Well, go ahead and tell me.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.566
- She was taken
to the White House

29:12.568 --> 29:14.568
to meet with the President.

29:14.570 --> 29:16.169
- Okay, sir.

29:16.171 --> 29:20.707
- No, I know this sounds crazy
but I'm telling you the truth.

29:20.709 --> 29:23.143
- Alright, tell me your story.

29:23.145 --> 29:24.778
- So, she's at work.

29:24.780 --> 29:26.947
Some agent came in.
He kidnaps her.

29:26.949 --> 29:28.949
He takes her to the White
House against her will.

29:28.951 --> 29:30.350
- And why would he do that?

29:30.352 --> 29:32.085
- Because he wanted
to meet with her. He's crazy.

29:32.087 --> 29:33.654
He has these fantasies.
It's nuts.

29:33.656 --> 29:35.922
- Oh, okay, and what
prescription medications

29:35.924 --> 29:37.090
have you been taking?

29:37.092 --> 29:39.126
- I'm serious, man.
This happened.

29:39.128 --> 29:42.796
I'm telling you the truth.
- Alright.

29:42.798 --> 29:44.631
- Is your sergeant
here or something?

29:44.633 --> 29:46.133
- My boss?
- Yes.

29:46.135 --> 29:47.067
- Yeah, he's here.

29:47.069 --> 29:49.670
- Okay, well, can
I talk with him?

29:49.672 --> 29:51.104
- Yeah, what did you
say your name was?

29:51.106 --> 29:53.807
- Kareem.

29:53.809 --> 29:56.076
- Wait a minute.

29:56.078 --> 29:59.913
You own the pharmacy.
- I do. How do you know that?

29:59.915 --> 30:03.083
- I took your statement that
day when you were assaulted.

30:03.085 --> 30:06.186
- Okay, yeah. I remember that.

30:06.188 --> 30:08.922
- Alright, I'll tell
you what, follow me.

30:08.924 --> 30:10.891
- Uh, but what
about your sergeant?

30:10.893 --> 30:13.327
- I'm taking you to him so we
can discuss this in private.

30:13.329 --> 30:15.495
This is a sensitive subject.

30:15.497 --> 30:17.364
- Oh, okay.
- Alright, follow me.

30:17.366 --> 30:19.232
I'm going on break.

30:32.881 --> 30:34.815
- Sir.
- Hey.

30:34.817 --> 30:38.785
- Hey. How is he?

30:38.787 --> 30:42.522
- Well, they're doing
all they can for him.

30:42.524 --> 30:44.358
- Yeah.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.593
Yeah, I see.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.296
- [sighs]

30:49.298 --> 30:52.432
I saw the news.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.901
- Yeah.

30:54.903 --> 30:56.870
- She really spun it.

30:56.872 --> 30:58.905
- Yeah, she did.

31:02.244 --> 31:05.545
- Is it working?

31:05.547 --> 31:08.415
- Yeah, considering.

31:11.520 --> 31:16.022
- Considering she
gave up my son.

31:16.024 --> 31:17.190
- Yeah.

31:19.728 --> 31:24.297
- Cold-hearted, cold-blooded.

31:25.267 --> 31:27.768
- I'm sorry, sir.

31:27.770 --> 31:31.304
- Look at this poor kid.

31:31.306 --> 31:35.776
Never had a chance
with a mother like that.

31:35.778 --> 31:41.081
- I'm sure that she
did her best, huh?

31:43.452 --> 31:49.022
- She was raised with
no love, no compassion,

31:49.024 --> 31:54.861
in a family, win at
all costs, no remorse.

31:54.863 --> 31:59.499
Over kill, name of the game.

31:59.501 --> 32:02.235
- Again, sir, I am sorry.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.974
- No, you're not.
- Sir?

32:11.079 --> 32:15.148
- Her doing that
keeps us in power.

32:15.150 --> 32:18.385
- Well, there's no sense in you
going through all of this pain

32:18.387 --> 32:21.955
for nothing, right?

32:21.957 --> 32:25.659
- If you say so, Donald.
- I know so, sir.

32:25.661 --> 32:29.763
- Yeah, okay.

32:29.765 --> 32:34.334
- Look, you've been here
for a while now right?

32:34.336 --> 32:38.071
You, you wanna head
back to the White House?

32:38.073 --> 32:40.006
- I'ma--

32:40.008 --> 32:43.276
I wanna stay here with my son.

32:43.278 --> 32:45.378
- You sure?

32:45.380 --> 32:46.980
- Yeah. Okay.

32:46.982 --> 32:51.418
- Of course, he's
gonna stay by his side.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.987
You see all these nurses?

32:53.989 --> 32:55.622
- Hello, Victoria.

32:55.624 --> 32:58.825
- Oh, he's gonna make a move.

32:58.827 --> 33:01.628
- You are, what's the word?

33:01.630 --> 33:03.296
Awful.

33:05.267 --> 33:09.269
- Wow, you talk about
me using this moment.

33:09.271 --> 33:12.138
And I'm not using
it for tits and ass.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.908
- Well, this is a hospital.

33:14.910 --> 33:18.545
Maybe they can do
something with yours.

33:18.547 --> 33:20.380
- Damn, he looks bad.

33:20.382 --> 33:24.117
- Yeah, that's what happens
when you fall several stories.

33:24.119 --> 33:28.321
- Mmm.
He said he was gonna do it.

33:28.323 --> 33:31.758
- Just like Gayle said
she was gonna do it.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.493
- Yeah.

33:33.495 --> 33:35.395
God, these kids are -- up.

33:35.397 --> 33:38.265
- Why don't you head on
back to the White House?

33:38.267 --> 33:43.036
- Well, I would love to,
dear, but I have to sit here

33:43.038 --> 33:47.741
and pretend to be really
concerned for this nation.

33:47.743 --> 33:49.075
- Hmm.

33:49.077 --> 33:51.511
- You know,
you should thank me.

33:51.513 --> 33:54.981
By the time I'm done with
that damn Second Family,

33:54.983 --> 33:57.584
people will think they
were the evil ones,

33:57.586 --> 34:03.156
who betrayed us while we
were just helping our son.

34:03.158 --> 34:07.561
- Yeah, yeah, you said a
lot up there on that podium.

34:07.563 --> 34:09.796
- I know.

34:09.798 --> 34:12.732
- A lot that can be refuted.

34:12.734 --> 34:18.104
- Well, we'll have the records
created to prove them wrong.

34:18.106 --> 34:19.673
- Politics 101.

34:19.675 --> 34:22.242
Cover up's worse
than the crime.

34:22.244 --> 34:26.713
- Not when I'm running shit.

34:26.715 --> 34:30.884
- Yeah, okay. You think you got
it al figured out, don't you?

34:30.886 --> 34:32.719
- No.

34:32.721 --> 34:35.055
No, I still haven't figured out

34:35.057 --> 34:37.991
how to kill you and
get away with it.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.560
- Well, your dad tried.

34:40.562 --> 34:43.229
He couldn't figure it out.

34:43.231 --> 34:45.699
- Well, whoever
did, I really wish

34:45.701 --> 34:47.233
they would have succeeded.

34:47.235 --> 34:49.936
- You know what?
If you'll just excuse me, huh?

34:49.938 --> 34:52.172
- Going somewhere?

34:52.174 --> 34:53.974
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
wait right outside

34:53.976 --> 34:56.610
in the waiting room.

34:56.612 --> 34:59.713
- Shouldn't you be at home,
to see why the Vice President

34:59.715 --> 35:01.615
is so in love with your wife?

35:01.617 --> 35:04.250
- Excuse me?

35:04.252 --> 35:07.020
- He thinks she's on your side.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.856
- Oh, I'll handle that one.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.691
- You better.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.428
- Excuse me.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.326
[sighs]

35:38.704 --> 35:41.204
Kyle, where are you?
Look, I need you to call me

35:41.206 --> 35:43.773
and I need you to call
me back right now.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.082
- I'm sorry, sir.

35:52.084 --> 35:54.551
- About what?

35:54.553 --> 35:57.387
- The First Son.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.555
- Why?

35:58.557 --> 36:01.691
Why are you sorry?

36:01.693 --> 36:04.828
- He was with me, sir.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.565
- Is that so? What happened?

36:08.567 --> 36:12.702
- I was watching him while
he was on the roof smoking.

36:12.704 --> 36:16.339
And, uh, he was so fast.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.275
He just jumped before I knew it.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.511
- I see.
- I'm sorry, sir.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.481
- No, no, no, no, it's okay.
- I'm going to resign.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.182
- No. No, you won't.
You look at me.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.153
Hey, hey, it's okay. Huh?

36:30.155 --> 36:33.056
- Yes, sir.

36:33.058 --> 36:36.292
- Now, I need you
to do me a favor.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.295
I want you to find Agent Kyle.

36:39.297 --> 36:40.930
Can you do that for me?

36:40.932 --> 36:41.998
- Yes, sir.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.901
- Track him, hmm?

36:44.903 --> 36:46.436
- Yes, sir.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.772
- You let me know
when you get him okay?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.140
- Yes, sir.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.709
- He was supposed to
report to me hours ago.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.344
- Yes, sir.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.246
And, um, sorry again.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.915
- Yeah, sure you are.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.190
- Yes.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.428
What?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.531
Where?

37:15.133 --> 37:16.933
[sighs]

37:16.935 --> 37:18.568
Yes.

37:20.172 --> 37:23.606
[sighs] Okay. Yeah, no, no.

37:23.608 --> 37:24.774
Hold on.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.644
Sir.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.112
- What?

37:29.114 --> 37:32.282
- This is DC Police.
- Okay.

37:32.284 --> 37:35.452
- They're saying they have
a Kareem Richardson there.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.953
And he's saying
that his girlfriend

37:36.955 --> 37:38.221
was kidnapped by the President.

37:38.223 --> 37:41.157
- Ah, are you serious?

37:41.159 --> 37:43.126
- Yes.
- Damn.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.161
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.796
- What do you
want me to do sir?

37:46.798 --> 37:48.731
- Uh, okay, uh, listen.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.434
You, you, you just
handle this for me, okay?

37:51.436 --> 37:53.403
And then, I want
you to track Kyle. Got it?

37:53.405 --> 37:55.805
- Yes sir.
- [sighs]

37:55.807 --> 37:57.407
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
head home soon.

You let me know if
you find out anything. Okay?

38:00.545 --> 38:03.313
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

38:05.784 --> 38:09.686
These people, they
just don't learn.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.225
- Max.

38:15.227 --> 38:16.926
- MAX: The truck is here, Sam.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.261
- Max.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.596
- MAX: Just bring him.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.631
- I told you that's
not happening.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.967
- MAX: Well, get
me in to see him.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.402
- After the shit storm that
your guy caused today?

38:26.404 --> 38:28.638
- MAX: Sam, come on.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.874
- Let this go and stop
calling me about him.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.542
- MAX: I want him.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.743
- Max.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.546
- MAX: The box truck
will stay there, Sam.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.616
- [sighs] Goodnight, Max.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.024
- What the hell
are you doing here?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.325
- Priscilla.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.528
- I had the locks
changed again.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.762
- You know who I am.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.498
- So, you just gonna
keep picking 'em?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.400
- Look, I'm coming
back to my house.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.135
- Sam, get your ass up
out of my house, please.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.436
I don't feel like
doing this tonight.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.338
- I'm not doing this, Priscilla.

39:04.743 --> 39:07.777
- Okay.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.279
I shoulda shot you.

39:09.281 --> 39:11.014
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.382
Right when you walked in,

39:12.384 --> 39:15.618
that was the perfect
time to shoot yo' ass.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.154
- Yeah, well, I'm
staying in my house.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.822
- Okay.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.859
We'll just see how great
your training really is.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.227
- Priscilla.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.729
- No, no, go upstairs.
Go get comfortable.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.765
Relax.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.267
- I am.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.603
- Not in our bed.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.105
- I'll be in the guest bedroom.

39:36.107 --> 39:40.944
- That ain't gonna save you.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.712
- Well, we'll see.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.115
I gotta go back to work.
See you later.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.355
- Shit.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.025
[sighs]

39:57.862 --> 39:59.429
Okay.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.397
I know what I seen.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.366

coming or what?

40:03.368 --> 40:04.867
- Yeah, he'll be here.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.337

Hi.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.781
- Hi.

40:18.783 --> 40:23.786

talking about the President.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.357
- Yeah, uh--

40:27.359 --> 40:29.959
- Okay.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.561
Tell me.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.867
- Why are you
dressed like that?

40:37.869 --> 40:39.268
- What do you mean?

40:39.270 --> 40:45.141
- I mean, where's your uniform?

40:45.143 --> 40:49.312
- This is my uniform.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.314

40:51.316 --> 40:55.218
- Oh, uh, no, no, no.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.787
I'm Secret Service.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.426
- Okay, yeah, no, hey, I
think I made a mistake, man.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.894
- Yeah, I'll say.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.563
- Yeah, uh, hey,

41:07.565 --> 41:08.831
How 'bout I just--

41:08.833 --> 41:12.835
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
No, no, no, just wait.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.438
- I, I'd rather not just, um--

41:15.440 --> 41:16.739
- It's okay.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.608
- Why you putting those on?

41:18.610 --> 41:22.278
Hey. Hey.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.312

41:23.314 --> 41:25.615

41:29.020 --> 41:31.020
- MAN: Next on The Oval.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.523

keep me here?

41:33.525 --> 41:35.358
- As long as it takes.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.694
- Victoria!

41:37.696 --> 41:39.762
- The little bastard
did us a favor.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.064
And I'm gonna milk this shit.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.099
- Where, exactly,
is their daughter?

41:43.101 --> 41:47.336
I think that if we find her,
we'll have a new witness.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.838
- Get yo' shit and get out!

41:48.840 --> 41:50.239
- Okay, Priscilla.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.507
- Okay!

41:51.509 --> 41:53.810

on my administration.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.411
He tried to ruin me.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.813
- What exactly do
you have planned?

41:56.815 --> 41:58.147
- They're all gonna die.
