mostly used by long-haul truckers.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.944
Well, that's convenient.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.177
Yeah, fits with the pattern, though.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.304
Pattern?

09:47.440 --> 09:48.907
They think it's part
of something bigger.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.340
And Wendy's not the only one.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.347

she was targeted

09:54.440 --> 09:55.759
by a serial abductor.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.502
Now that spike we found on the tire,
that's classic Butterfly.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.304
Sorry. "Butterfly"?

10:00.640 --> 10:02.141
That's what we call him.
What I call him.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.545
He's got kind of a migrating pattern.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.063
Now, in the winter
he makes his way southward,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.227
targeting people
that are traveling alone,

10:09.320 --> 10:10.423
people who won't be missed.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.626
Then in the summer, he turns around
and he heads back up north.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.108
And what about the victims?

10:18.080 --> 10:19.069
Go on.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.304
They disappear.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.708

10:31.320 --> 10:34.699

so we could retrace her steps.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.102
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.577
Uh, what's this?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.705
That is the last 12 years of my life.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.827
Right there is every person
we think got taken by the Butterfly.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.102
- Really?
- Like I was telling Donna,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.588
the last place that we can put Wendy

14:56.680 --> 14:59.057
is at a gas station
in Oshkosh, Nebraska.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.502
Now based on the Butterfly's pattern,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.465
I have a short list
of suspects that I like,

15:02.560 --> 15:05.063
but there's one guy in particular
I've always liked more than the others.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.149
You ever bring him in?

15:06.240 --> 15:09.539
No. Could never get
anything concrete to link up.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.420
Until now. You see, that night,

15:13.480 --> 15:14.663
he was there, too.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.709
That's you!' guy?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.987
Pastor "Diamond" Don Hankey.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.104
Road preacher.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.061
Ministers to truckers, mostly.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.458
Don't let his squeaky clean
act fool you, though.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.857
He's got a jacket.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.020
Arrests for lewd behavior,
couple drunk and disorderlies.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.906
Thank you for your service, son.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.747
And when we picked him up,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.183
we found this.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.463
That's Wendy's.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.107
LIZ: So this girl of yours...

15:59.200 --> 16:00.622
You saw her that night?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.069
Yeah. Twice.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.109
Usually, I... I try to stay out
of this sort of stuff.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.944
I just run my route
and keep out of trouble.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.259
But that night, that girl...

16:16.960 --> 16:18.507
Like I said, I saw her twice.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.667
One; at
station oﬁ‘l-l/ghway
26

16:22.760 --> 16:26.105
and then later,
I was driving of?" Road 88 and...

16:26.720 --> 16:28.221
Hey. Hey!

16:33.480 --> 16:34.822
I shouldn't have left her there.

16:35.800 --> 16:40.066
But I was running behind schedule
and Ijust...

16:42.360 --> 16:44.146
Well, it's the only reason
I even gassed up there.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.185
That place gives me the creeps.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.222
And what's this place called?

16:48.360 --> 16:49.702
Manny's Truck Stop Cafe.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.904
The other night, we can put you there.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.460
I go where my ministry takes me.

17:02.920 --> 17:03.944
You know her?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.142
Her name is Wendy Hanscum.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.743
Recent high school grad. Popular.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.679
She had her whole life ahead of her.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.343
No?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.303
What about him?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.223
Luis Fernando.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.503
He had a family.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.303
They're both missing.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.822
The girl looks vaguely familiar.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.499
Never laid eyes on the immigrant.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.864
Wow.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.949
Nice.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.621
Okay, let's focus on the girl, then.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.903
Lawyer.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.340
- Excuse me?
- I know my rights.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.103
Do you think I give a tinker's damn

17:47.120 --> 17:48.303
about your rights?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.785
I don't care what you
or your goon think.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.304
I know my rights,
so get me a lawyer. Now.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.657
Then you can ask me anything you like
about your illegal and your whore.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.421
Tough guy, huh?

18:03.560 --> 18:06.142
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
Agent, Agent, Agent. Agent, please.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.703
Mind if I talk to him?

18:18.320 --> 18:19.309
Thanks for coming.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.022
DOUG: Got that report you asked for.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.584
Everything that's gone down at
Manny's Truck Stop Cafe lately.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.581
- And?
- Couple of D&Ds,

18:28.840 --> 18:31.149
four counts of public urination, but...

18:31.880 --> 18:33.620
Nothing that screams
secret hunting ground

18:33.720 --> 18:35.381
-for a kidnapper.
- Not exactly.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.026
Can I ask you a question? About Donna?

18:45.920 --> 18:46.944
Okay.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.479
Is she gonna be okay?

18:50.760 --> 18:52.625
I mean, I love Donna,

18:52.720 --> 18:54.984
but I've only known her for
a couple years, and this...

18:56.280 --> 18:57.542
I've never seen her like this.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.623
I'm not sure what you mean.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.780
I mean, she's barely talkin' to me,
and we always talk.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.663
About the Vikes, about Real Housewives,

19:08.120 --> 19:09.109
about everything.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.943
(SIGHS)

19:13.040 --> 19:14.940
This is a tough time, I know,

19:16.320 --> 19:18.060
but I think she's hiding
something from me.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.467
Anyhoo, forget it.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.268
It's probably nothing.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.064
Doug, you're a good guy.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.101
And you're gonna be there for Donna.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.588
You betcha.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.103
So, you know, just trust her.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.584
Okay?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.304
I said I want my lawyer.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.537
You sure?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.264
I mean, the Bible doesn't have
much good to say about them.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.266
"But the Pharisees and the lavwers
rejected God's purpose for themselves,

19:59.680 --> 20:02.103
"not having been baptized by John."

20:02.200 --> 20:04.065
You know your scripture.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.819
Even the good book's got lavwer jokes.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.462
I know what you're doin'.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.466
- And I want--
- Lawyer. Yeah, yeah.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.869
Okay, but here's the thing.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.941
This is a small town.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.039
And it's Friday night. You know?

20:21.440 --> 20:23.419
So if you're lucky,

20:24.040 --> 20:27.624
they might be able to get you
a public defender by Monday.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.709
Maybe.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.222
Which means you get to spend
at least two nights

20:32.320 --> 20:33.457
in the big cell.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.018
Just you and a bunch of guys who,

20:38.120 --> 20:42.989
well, look at you and all they're gonna
see is Sunday dinner.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.140
So, if you wanna deal with that, super.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.823
Or...

20:56.120 --> 20:57.621
You could answer a few questions,

20:58.480 --> 20:59.947
and I can get you outta here.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.824
Your call.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.909
She's good.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.583
Yeah, she is.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.457

21:20.120 --> 21:21.144
Have you seen her?

21:22.080 --> 21:23.069
May have.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.263
Mm-hmm.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.989
Keep talking.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.501
She was in a couple nights ago.
Marlon liked her.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.977
- Marlon?
- JIMBO: He's the cashier.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.662
After she left, he closed up early
and drove off after her.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.148
Didn't come back till dawn.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.577
Uh-huh.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.542
How long you been on the road?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.142
Oh.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.502
A long time.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.181
Maybe 12 years, you'd say?

21:53.280 --> 21:54.668
Yeah, could be.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.421
You just travel all over, huh?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.667

you flashed outside Cheyenne?

22:13.720 --> 22:16.359
How 'bout that teenage boy who says
you picked him up hitchhiking?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.669
I'm weak.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.344

I don't...

22:44.960 --> 22:46.063
That's not...

22:46.160 --> 22:47.422
We found it in your van.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.907
You hurt her, right?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.300
- No. No, no, no, no.
- You made her bleed.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.664
Don't lie to me.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.057
No, I'm not.

- But the shirt...

23:30.120 --> 23:32.987
Yeah, the shirt doesn't make any sense.
I mean, what?

I'm... I'm a criminal mastermind
that aVOIds capture for 12 years

23:36.040 --> 23:38.099
and when I'm finally arrested,
there's a bloody shirt in my van

23:38.200 --> 23:40.259
that links me to one of the victims?
It's too easy.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.622
So someone planted it.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.823
Definitely possible.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.419
I mean, maybe back at the truck stop?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.101

You head around back.
We'll take the front.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.583
All clear.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.519
You okay hanging back?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.581
Someone's gotta watch him.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.501
Dougie, we'll figure this out
when we get back to Stillwater, okay?

27:58.800 --> 27:59.789
Here.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.902
Twenty minutes. Let's go.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.105
- What are you doing here?
- You called me.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.418
I called you for an address,
not for backup.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.426
So you send me a link to a website
that sells people,

28:18.520 --> 28:19.623
you don't expect me to Show up?

28:19.760 --> 28:21.500
Look, I don't know
what the hell's going on here,

28:22.040 --> 28:23.541
but I've been hunting
the Butterfly a long time.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.942
Now, I need to see this through.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.902
All right, follow me.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.666
Lady sheriff's pretty hot.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.777
You two a thing? 'Cause, man,
she is way out of your league.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.909
Shut up.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.623
(U PBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

28:48.520 --> 28:49.544
No.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.029
No.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.747
Please, please, just let me go.
Please, you don't have to do this.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.263
Please! Please, just let me go.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.623
No!

-(MUSIC GETTING LOUDER)
-(WHISTLES)

29:37.160 --> 29:38.229
Hey.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.586
Remember what they said about monsters?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.383
Fun fact,

29:44.880 --> 29:45.949
I am one.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.309
Vampire, actually.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.987
(BOTH GRUNTING)

30:02.520 --> 30:03.839
Let's have some fun.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.977
One...

30:17.280 --> 30:18.417
Doug!

30:20.000 --> 30:22.377
- What happened? Where's Marlon?
- Hold on.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.381
Just hold on. You're gonna be okay.
Where are you hurt?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.299
I'm not hurt, but...

30:37.120 --> 30:38.940
I don't think I'm okay.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.537
Doug. Oh, God.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.187
- I'm hungry-
- Okay.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.304
DOUG: I'm so hungry.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.863
DONNA: Doug!

30:56.680 --> 30:57.669
Is he...

30:57.760 --> 30:58.829
A vamp, yeah.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.348
DONNA: Oh, God.
DEAN: Yeah.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.704
The change, sometimes it's fast,
sometimes it's slow,

31:02.800 --> 31:04.142
just depends on the person.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.026
I just shot him up with
some dead man's blood.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.439
He should be knocked out for a while.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.509
Oh, jeez.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.669
He'll be okay.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.423
You call this okay?

31:12.520 --> 31:14.021
Look, he just got turned, okay?

31:14.120 --> 31:16.338
Which means that he hasn't fed,
which means that there is a cure.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.546
_ - Huh?
- We just need to me up some sage,

31:18.640 --> 31:19.629
a little bit of garlic--

31:19.720 --> 31:22.587
And you need the bloodsucker
who turned him.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.220
Well, thanks for making it easy for me.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.305
You never even saw it cumin’.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.989
He got you.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.902
- He who?
- Clegg, man.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.262
He's got your brother.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.709
Where?

31:39.520 --> 31:40.987
(SCOFFS) Wouldn't you like to know.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.423
Shouldn't have been so rough with me.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.022
I hold a grudge.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.149
Well...

31:51.560 --> 31:52.777
Bring it, Twilight.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.479
You, get his blood and mix that cure.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.829
And you.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.617
Where's Clegg?

32:12.200 --> 32:14.065
Itell you, you'll kill me.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.509
I'm killing you either way.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.343
You just gotta decide
if you want it fast or slow.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.661
No, no, no. Get further back with that.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.661
He's a big boy.
We need him on a wide lens.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.064
You...

32:32.440 --> 32:33.782
You're the Butterfly.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.869
And you're Sam Winchester.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.897
You and your brother are famous.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.857
Hell, soon as I saw that
fancy car, I knew who you were.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.182
And I knew you'd be trouble.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.422
Tried to give you that preacher,
but you saw right through that.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.080
So now it's on to Plan B.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.479
Why are you doing this?

32:54.320 --> 32:55.639
Well, 'cause somebody has to.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.824
How many monsters do you think
are out there, Sam?

33:00.320 --> 33:03.027
You know, if you had to guess.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.986
Hundreds. Thousands.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.019
Add a zero. Actually, add two.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.980
See, those freaks that you
and your brother chase,

33:14.080 --> 33:15.866
those are just the ones that can't pass,

33:16.320 --> 33:19.062
either because they're too mean
or they're too stupid,

33:19.680 --> 33:20.783
or both.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.542
But most monsters,

33:23.280 --> 33:25.145
hell, they could be
your next-door neighbor.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.023
They work a regular job,

33:27.680 --> 33:29.341
mow the lawns on a Saturday.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.147
And they need to eat,
which is where I come in.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.103
So you sell them people.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.899
I sell them people
other people won't miss.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.381
And because I do that, I save lives.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.980
If my customers didn't have me,

33:47.800 --> 33:51.145
then all those hungry, hungry hippos
would be out there huntin' and killin'.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.822
And you couldn't stop 'em.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.464
No one could.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.229
You should be thanking me.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.867
Huh.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.787
Yeah. All right. Go to Hell.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.829
I'll see you there.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.059
Now, I know you've been
stalling because you think

34:11.160 --> 34:12.866
Dean's gonna show up,

34:13.160 --> 34:14.184
but sorry, kid.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.309
It's showtime.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.983
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:32.160 --> 34:34.264
we interrupt your regularly
scheduled program

34:34.800 --> 34:37.746
to bring you something truly spec/al,

34:37.840 --> 34:38.943
a new auction.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.703
Introducing

34:41.120 --> 34:43.702
Mr. Sam Winchester!

34:49.200 --> 34:51.657
This is gonna work, right?

34:52.960 --> 34:54.348
It worked on me.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.583
Okay.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.189
There you go.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.743
There you go.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.900
CLEGG: $5, 000 for the liver. Going once,

35:07.480 --> 35:08.617
going twice...

35:09.040 --> 35:10.029
Sold!

35:11.080 --> 35:13.457
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

35:13.840 --> 35:15.262
let's begin the auction

35:15.920 --> 35:18.707
for Sam Winchester's heart!

35:55.880 --> 35:56.949
Wendy!

35:58.800 --> 35:59.983
Aunt Donna?

36:01.480 --> 36:03.061
(BOTH GRUNTING)

36:22.720 --> 36:24.381
CLEGG: $50, 000. Do I have $60, 000?

36:24.480 --> 36:27.187
$60,000? $60,000, yes!

36:27.280 --> 36:28.349
Do I have $65,000?

36:28.440 --> 36:30.579
Look at that jump! $100,000!

36:31.000 --> 36:34.299
Folks, there are many pieces
to Sam W/nchester,

36:34.600 --> 36:36.022
but only one heat.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.347
Look at that! $500,000!

36:39.440 --> 36:41.180
$500,000 going once,

36:41.560 --> 36:42.822
going twice...

36:43.200 --> 36:44.417
Sold!

36:44.600 --> 36:45.862
(GROWLS SOFI'LY)

36:53.600 --> 36:55.977
Usually, we do this next part
kind of slow,

36:56.080 --> 36:57.627
so you can feel it.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.062
But since Dean's out there,

37:01.200 --> 37:02.303
quick and dirty.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.108
Say goodbye, Sam.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.023
(GUNSHOT)

37:16.040 --> 37:17.177

- Jeez.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.377
Dougie Bear?

37:39.880 --> 37:40.904
Are you okay?

37:44.160 --> 37:45.502
You feel like you wanna bite any of us?

37:47.320 --> 37:48.457
Not really.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.746
All right. Then I guess it worked.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.429
Wendy?

37:56.680 --> 37:59.183
She's safe. She's at a hospital.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.784
She's gonna be fine, just like you.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.666
- Fine?
- Yeah.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.903
I was a vampire.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.102
For a couple hours.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.297
Listen, Doug.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.342
I know it's been a day.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.987
But now you know what's out there.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.859
Be nice to have another good guy
on our side.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.189
No.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.777
Maybe you all can live this life,

38:38.760 --> 38:39.977
but I can't.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.942
Ijust wanna go home.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.023
So we'll go home.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.422
And what?

38:50.760 --> 38:53.320
I'm a cop 'cause I like
helpin' folks, but...

38:55.960 --> 38:58.144
Vampires? That's...

39:05.960 --> 39:07.029
I'm not...

39:08.360 --> 39:09.497
Doug.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.348
I'm sorry I lied to you.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.502
But I can't give this up.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.662
I know.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.546
Donna, you kill monsters.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.823
You're a damn hero.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.664
But that's...

39:36.240 --> 39:37.309
It's not me.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.622
I'm sorry.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.102
I love you.

39:50.000 --> 39:50.989
I'm sorry.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.945
- Doug, wait!
- SAM: Let him go.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.399
Donna, when you choose this life,

40:00.080 --> 40:01.263
anyone who gets too close,

40:01.440 --> 40:03.897
eventually, they get hurt or worse.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.823
So let him go.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.063
He'll be safer that way.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.029
(SNIFFLING)

40:28.440 --> 40:30.305
You were a little tough
on Donna back there.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.389
What?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.662
Just sayin'.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.461
Was I wrong?

40:36.560 --> 40:39.905
I mean, when has knowing us
ever worked out for anyone?

40:42.520 --> 40:44.147
Well, I mean, we save people, Sam.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.549
Yeah, we also get people killed, Dean.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.548
Kaia, for instance.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.824
She helped us and she died for it.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.507
Hey, look, I know you're
in some sort of a--

40:55.640 --> 40:57.062
No, no, no, no, don't... Don't...

40:58.400 --> 41:00.539
You keep saying I'm in a dark place,

41:00.640 --> 41:02.062
but I'm not, Dean.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.660
Everything I'm saying is the truth.
It's our lives.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.820
And I tried to pretend
it didn't have to be.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.059
I tried to pretend we could
have Mom back and Cass

41:10.160 --> 41:11.548
and help Jack.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.457
But we can't.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.026
This ends one way for us, Dean.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.657
It ends bloody.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.148
It ends bad.
