16:37.997 --> 16:39.215
and the landing gear,

16:39.389 --> 16:41.565
which is absolutely
riddled with bullets.

16:41.739 --> 16:45.308
That is more than
a quiet act of aggression.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.094
Washington wants us ready
to respond to the Russians

16:48.268 --> 16:50.835
and, uh, this is what
we'’re gonna get ready with.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.447
[Bill] Say hello
to the F4U Corsair.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.406
Flew the hog
a little after the war.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.626
But the Navy'’s gone
and made '’em fatter
and meaner.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.237
Now, I know that the Corsair
will be new for a lot of you,
but don'’t worry.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.935
Just like yours truly,
she earned her stripes
in The Big Show.

17:04.109 --> 17:06.155
Now, this is a plane that will
get your hands dirty.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.375
You'’re gonna be
so close to the action,

17:08.549 --> 17:10.768
you'’re gonna start to think
that you made the mistake
of joining the Army.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.294
And I gotta mention,
she'’s got a rather
unfortunate nickname.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.425
"The Widow-maker."

17:15.598 --> 17:17.165
Good thing
I ain'’t hitched.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.777
Well, they also call her
the "Ensign Eliminator."

17:19.951 --> 17:22.954
This engine'’s one of
the most powerful things
you'’ll ever fly behind.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.087
You throttle her too hard,
she'’ll spin you over.

17:25.261 --> 17:28.569
She'’s got enough torque
to flip a house,
so go easy on the power.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.962
CAG wants us
up to speed and fast.

17:31.137 --> 17:34.227
So, manuals are
getting dropped off
in the ready room.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.403
Any other questions,

17:36.577 --> 17:39.536
God help ya,
take '’em up with the good
Professor Koenig here.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.017
All right.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.324
-[Tom] Oh, she looks
pretty mean, huh?
-[Marty] The "Widow-maker."

17:44.498 --> 17:45.977
[Bo] Oh! She is a beaut!

17:46.152 --> 17:48.154
-[Carol] Hey, Professor K?
-[Bo] She'’s awful purdy.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.721
[pilot]
Now, Bo, you don'’t know what
you'’re doing with this thing.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.082
[grunts]

18:11.873 --> 18:13.266
[engine hisses]

18:14.789 --> 18:15.833
Need a lift?

18:27.541 --> 18:29.412
Guys said you had
family nearby?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.591
Across the bay
in Fall River.

18:36.289 --> 18:39.944
They must be happy,
having you back.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.252
I think they'’d be happier
if I were coming back
to work for the family.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.300
Supposed to take over
my old man'’s grocery stores.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.128
[smacks lips]

18:49.302 --> 18:50.868
But I was called to adventure.

18:53.001 --> 18:53.915
What about you?

18:54.089 --> 18:55.264
What brought you here?

18:55.438 --> 18:56.961
Always wanted to fly.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.312
Wanted to fly where
the best pilots flew.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.183
That'’d be the Navy.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.539
-[Jesse] Thanks for the lift.
-[Tom] Of course.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.587
Ma'’am. Tom Hudner.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.502
Daisy.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.246
Can I get you
something to drink?

19:22.073 --> 19:24.424
I'’m sure Lieutenant Hudner
has plans.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.471
Better be getting back, ma'’am.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.648
Beautiful house, by the way.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.302
Nice to see it
from the ground.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.218
Thank you.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.008
Play nice.What?

19:44.748 --> 19:45.967
Play nice.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
I don'’t know about him yet.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.321
[Daisy] Where'’s our car?

19:52.930 --> 19:54.062
Where'’s our baby?

19:54.236 --> 19:55.237
Sleeping.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.066
Car'’s on the side
of the road.

19:58.762 --> 19:59.720
Abandoned.

19:59.894 --> 20:00.808
[Daisy sighs] Okay.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.113
[Jesse] Tires are probably gone.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.289
[Daisy chuckles]

20:03.463 --> 20:04.768
[pilot] Hey, airmen!

20:06.248 --> 20:08.163
My tail fin could use
some air.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.820
[soldier on PA]
Stand by for check time.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.822
Stand by for check time.

20:14.996 --> 20:15.910
[Bo] Hey, Lieutenant!

20:16.084 --> 20:18.086
I think she likes me.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.827
Famous last words.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.442
She'’s not gonna bite.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.455
[Carol] You know
what'’s not in the manual?

20:39.629 --> 20:41.544
How big this damn nose is.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.940
How the hell are you
supposed to land on a carrier
if you can'’t see it?

20:46.114 --> 20:49.335
Not everything'’s
in the same place, Carol,
but everything'’s the same.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.338
Just in different places.

20:52.512 --> 20:55.036
Hey.
You know I crashed a Bearcat
when I was learning to fly it?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.386
You know, you better not
let Goode hear you say that.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.779
Too late.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.228
[metal creaks]

21:15.317 --> 21:17.841
[metal creaks]

21:23.847 --> 21:26.633
[narrator on radio]
Many outstanding
fighter pilot achievements

21:26.807 --> 21:28.896
may seem almost unbelievable.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.333
[engines roaring]

21:33.857 --> 21:36.860
But once you have learned
how they accomplished
these victories,

21:37.034 --> 21:39.123
and the system they used,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.648
you'’ll realize it'’s just
a trick of the trade

21:41.822 --> 21:45.652
carried out by fighting men
with the ability and know-how

21:45.826 --> 21:48.002
that it takes to win
aerial battles.

22:13.767 --> 22:18.815
The keynote of fighter tactics
in the United States Navy
today is teamwork.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.340
[engines roaring]

22:21.514 --> 22:25.474
Teamwork, coordination,
cooperation,
call it what you will,

22:25.648 --> 22:27.607
gives the fighter
its greatest value

22:27.781 --> 22:30.479
in escorting bombers
and torpedo planes
on their missions.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.440
In enabling fighters
to protect other fighters,

22:34.614 --> 22:39.009
in winning engagements
that may mean the losing
or the saving of a carrier.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.713
You have to fight them
with your head,

22:46.887 --> 22:47.975
using your judgment,

22:49.455 --> 22:51.282
your skill
in plane-handling,

22:51.457 --> 22:55.069
and your superior gunnery
to turn the odds
in your favor.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.637
It'’s a matter
of life insurance

22:57.811 --> 23:00.030
to make every
split-second count.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.296
[gunfire]

23:05.471 --> 23:06.820
[commander] Attention on deck.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.780
As you were, gentlemen.
As you were.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.957
I'’m Captain Thomas Sisson,

23:14.131 --> 23:15.916
and I command the USS Leyte.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.309
Now, we have learned
that the Soviets are jockeying

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
for a warm water port
in the Mediterranean.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.488
Now, they think they can
bully their way into Europe

23:22.662 --> 23:25.012
and spook our new NATO allies.

23:25.186 --> 23:28.363
Well, DC thinks it'’s best
if we prevent them
from doing so.

23:28.537 --> 23:31.714
And we are crewing up
to keep the Cold War
from turning hot,

23:31.888 --> 23:34.369
and Cevoli here tells me
this is the best place
to do so.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.458
We ship out next week.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.112
Look forward to
having you onboard.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.598
All right, all right.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.645
You remember when I told you
to get up to speed, and fast?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.474
I meant speedier and faster.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.476
Carrier quals are at
the end of the week.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.478
You can'’t land a Corsair
on the Leyte,

23:56.652 --> 23:58.654
uh, you get yourself
a nice dry-land job in Topeka

23:58.828 --> 24:00.917
or some place even shittier,
God help you.

24:01.657 --> 24:02.658
Either way,

24:03.746 --> 24:05.444
start settling up
your bar tab, boys.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.837
We are leaving Rhode Island.

24:08.011 --> 24:10.057
[pilot] Ah, here it comes.

24:15.062 --> 24:19.806
Just because I'’m going
doesn'’t mean I'’m fighting,
Daisy.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.156
[sighs]

24:28.771 --> 24:30.686
That'’s the deal, darling.

24:31.992 --> 24:32.993
Remember?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.607
We knew this day might come.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.742
And yet it doesn'’t
make it any easier.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.145
But we'’ll be okay.

24:58.975 --> 24:59.889
Mad...

25:00.063 --> 25:01.195
[chuckles]

25:02.588 --> 25:03.719
...but okay.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.329
Okay.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.770
[sighs]

25:13.686 --> 25:14.861
Jesse, what'’s going on?

25:15.644 --> 25:16.645
Honestly...

25:21.476 --> 25:23.870
My mind'’s on landing
that Corsair tomorrow.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.657
You never met a plane
you couldn'’t land, Jesse.

25:28.831 --> 25:32.139
This plane
will be the death of me.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.533
I can'’t see like I can
out of a Bearcat.

25:37.753 --> 25:38.972
Fogs my instincts.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.847
Your instincts...

25:46.370 --> 25:49.199
are one of the few things
in this world that I trust.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.942
And if you can'’t
trust that plane,

25:53.116 --> 25:55.162
you gotta put it in whatever
will get you down safe.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.574
Yes, ma'’am.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.926
-[Marty] You ready, Carol?
-[Carol] Try and keep up, Marty.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.058
[Bo] Bottom of the board
buys drinks tonight, boys.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.712
[Marty] I hope
you brought cash.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.366
[Bo] Won'’t need it,
we'’ll be spending yours.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.194
[door opens]

26:31.459 --> 26:32.503
[door closes]

26:54.090 --> 26:58.660
[breathes deeply]

27:16.156 --> 27:17.505
You ain'’t shit.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.339
[exhales]

27:29.125 --> 27:31.911
You ain'’t never landing
that plane, nigger.

27:38.569 --> 27:39.614
Boy.

27:47.274 --> 27:50.059
Your monkey-ass
shouldn'’t even be flying.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.678
[grunts]

28:01.810 --> 28:04.508
[breathes heavily]

28:10.210 --> 28:11.211
[grunts]

28:21.525 --> 28:22.570
[sniffles]

28:37.237 --> 28:41.545
[sniffles, breathes heavily]

29:08.007 --> 29:10.400
[officer on PA]
Flight ops commence,
flight ops commence.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.708
Be aware of all prop wash.
All hands on deck.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.101
[sailor] Don'’t need all hands.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.103
[sailor 2] Doing it!

29:17.277 --> 29:19.148
[officer on PA]
All repair parties,
man your stations.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.455
All repair parties,
man your stations.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.762
[crew shouting, chattering]

29:27.722 --> 29:29.898
[engine roaring]

29:38.385 --> 29:40.430
-[Dick] That'’s Hudner.
-[Carol] Mm-hmm.

29:47.002 --> 29:50.310
[officer on radio] You'’re on
a good approach, Hudner.
Just keep an eye on the LSO.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.202
[grunts]

30:15.422 --> 30:16.815
All right, pretty boy.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.821
[cable wobbles]

30:33.222 --> 30:35.877
All right, three-to-one
he misses it.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.096
I'’ll take the action.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.315
Bonus if he splashes?

30:39.489 --> 30:41.535
[chuckles]
Christ, Bo,
we don'’t want him dead.

30:42.318 --> 30:45.060
[landing gear whirs]

30:57.899 --> 31:00.554
Looks like they wanna see
Jackie Robinson steal home.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.174
[officer on radio]
Ensign Brown, you'’re too high.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.611
That'’s a shit approach.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.194
Come on. Get your nose up.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.720
Why isn'’t he listening
to the LSO?

31:40.942 --> 31:42.465
[grunts]

31:45.164 --> 31:46.905
[engine roars]

31:49.342 --> 31:50.821
[all shout]Geez!

31:50.996 --> 31:52.084
[all shout]

31:54.129 --> 31:56.044
[grunts]

31:56.218 --> 31:58.655
[officer on radio]
That was pretty close, Brown.
Do you wanna call it?

31:58.829 --> 32:00.440
I'’m coming back around.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.532
[officer on PA]
Crash crew, stand by.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.018
[breathes heavily]

32:15.716 --> 32:17.805
[officer on radio]
You'’re still too high, Brown.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.815
You'’re not in the groove.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.425
I'’ll get there.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.485
[grunts]

32:52.231 --> 32:54.624
[engine roars]

33:04.417 --> 33:07.028
[cable wobbles]

33:07.768 --> 33:08.812
[exhales]

33:09.726 --> 33:10.901
[all cheer]

33:11.772 --> 33:12.860
All right, Jesse.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.036
[sailor] Attaboy!

33:15.210 --> 33:17.386
[officer on PA]
Attention, all hands.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.606
Flight operations
commence in one hour.

33:19.780 --> 33:23.044
FOD walk in 15 mikes.
All available hands on deck.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.351
FOD walk in 15 mikes.

33:25.525 --> 33:28.441
Doesn'’t matter how you did it.
Just matters that
you got down, pal.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.096
[Dick] Fellas,

33:32.184 --> 33:33.533
you all passed
your carrier quals.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.056
[all cheer]

33:35.230 --> 33:36.231
[pilot] That'’s what
I'’m talking about.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.016
Top marks go to...Yeah.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.409
Lieutenant Hudner
with the only
perfect grade.

33:40.583 --> 33:41.671
Oh, bastard.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.717
Which brings us
to Ensign Brown.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.633
D-N-K-U-A!

33:46.807 --> 33:49.331
[all]
Damn near killed us all.

33:49.505 --> 33:52.726
[Dick] Enjoy tonight, boys.
We ship out in the morning.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.945
And now is the time,
if you haven'’t already,

33:55.120 --> 33:56.382
get all your affairs
in order.

33:57.905 --> 33:58.949
All right.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.911
[pilot] What affairs
do you have to get in order,
my friend?

34:05.304 --> 34:06.609
[pilot 2] I'’m headed
to Denver, boys.

34:07.436 --> 34:08.958
That was some landing.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.701
[pilot 3] I'’m never
too drunk to drive.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.572
Just trying to
keep it interesting.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.317
You get your car fixed yet?

34:25.411 --> 34:27.108
You heading to the bar
with the guys?

34:27.935 --> 34:28.978
I don'’t think so.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.072
[clears throat]

34:34.724 --> 34:35.768
Wanna come in?

34:43.516 --> 34:44.952
[engine stops]

34:50.697 --> 34:51.784
Hey, Daisy?

34:52.351 --> 34:53.525
Yes?

34:53.699 --> 34:54.701
[door closes]

35:01.925 --> 35:03.144
What did I tell you?

35:06.974 --> 35:08.018
Yes, ma'’am.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.369
[child] Mommy?

35:10.543 --> 35:11.457
Oh.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.546
Let me get her.Okay.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.899
Nice to see you again.You as well.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.864
[mumbles]

35:28.038 --> 35:29.170
Which one do you like?

35:31.390 --> 35:32.391
The blue one?

35:33.479 --> 35:34.480
The gray one?

35:37.047 --> 35:38.092
The gray one.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.922
You had a good day?Mm-hmm.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.445
Yeah?Uh-huh.

35:43.619 --> 35:44.620
What'’d you do?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.536
You don'’t remember?

35:47.710 --> 35:48.711
Here you are.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.845
Thought Jesse didn'’t drink.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.063
He doesn'’t.

35:54.587 --> 35:55.588
[chuckles]

35:59.592 --> 36:01.071
Your husband'’s
quite the aviator.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.204
Well, he must feel
the same way about you.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.510
Because you
and Carol Mohring

36:04.684 --> 36:06.164
are the only boys
from Fighting 32

36:06.338 --> 36:07.817
that he has ever
invited over.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.907
It'’s good to know the men
you'’re flying with.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.388
See what they'’re fighting for.

36:14.737 --> 36:15.738
I like that.

36:18.219 --> 36:21.266
And what about you, Tom?
What are you fighting for?

36:21.440 --> 36:24.138
God, country
and honor aside.

36:24.312 --> 36:25.705
You know, Mrs. Brown, I'’m...

36:26.923 --> 36:28.186
hoping to find that out.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.752
[Jesse laughs]

36:29.926 --> 36:30.971
Come on.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.713
-Come on.
-[child] Okay.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.672
Don'’t be fooled
by his strong,
silent act, by the way.

36:36.846 --> 36:37.891
He trusts you,

36:39.153 --> 36:41.416
I swear,
he'’s the funniest man
you'’ll ever know.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.551
I can'’t say he'’s shown me
that side yet.Mm-hmm.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.293
Something to
look forward to.
[chuckles]

36:48.467 --> 36:51.209
Well, you'’re about to spend
a lot of time together.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.776
Lot of time
in very small spaces.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.003
May I ask you a favor?

37:04.134 --> 37:05.223
Of course.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.228
Second he steps on that ship
and into that plane,

37:11.185 --> 37:12.969
I can'’t protect him anymore.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.102
So I need you to be there
for my Jesse.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.409
Okay?

37:20.629 --> 37:21.935
Okay.

37:23.806 --> 37:24.938
Okay.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.156
[Jesse] Good?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.116
-[child] Hmm.
-[Jesse] That was good, yeah?

37:29.290 --> 37:30.378
Uh-huh.Mm-hmm.

37:30.552 --> 37:31.771
[Daisy chuckles]

37:31.945 --> 37:33.163
Who is this?

37:34.295 --> 37:36.819
This is Pam.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.648
Hi, Pam.

37:40.867 --> 37:44.740
[mimics airplane]

37:47.003 --> 37:48.875
I don'’t think
she wants to embarrass
you, Lieutenant.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.006
[Daisy chuckles]

37:50.180 --> 37:51.791
It'’s too late. Come on.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.229
She might hold the stick
better than you.Okay.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.665
[chuckles]

37:56.839 --> 37:58.972
Well, I know
it'’s our last night here,

37:59.146 --> 38:02.018
so I'’ll let you all
enjoy it together.
Thank you again for the drink.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.238
You'’re very welcome.I'’ll walk ya out.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.739
Just be careful.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.873
Worst thing
that can happen to me
is a bad sunburn.

38:31.047 --> 38:33.702
You come back as black
as you like,
as long as you come home.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.794
'’Cause you'’re taking me
to The Bahamas
when you get back.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.056
Bahamas?

38:40.230 --> 38:41.623
If I get some shore time,

38:41.797 --> 38:44.670
I'’ll get you one of
those European swimsuits.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.282
One of those
two-piece things.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.469
Tootie...

39:03.819 --> 39:06.169
you know you can always
come back here and wave to me.

39:08.824 --> 39:12.785
I'’m only 5,000 miles
that way.[chuckles]

39:15.527 --> 39:18.094
I'’ll wave back.Mm-hmm.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.709
The only person I ever met

39:25.580 --> 39:26.799
belonged in the sky.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.501
Just remember you belong
down here with us, too, okay?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.296
[sighs]

39:52.390 --> 39:54.522
I'’ll write you
every week.Mm-hmm.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.351
I know you will.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.093
[sighs]

40:32.560 --> 40:34.344
[all panting]

41:00.849 --> 41:02.372
[sailor] Break those
chains down.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.919
[officer on PA]
Secure from General Quarters.
All hands!

41:27.093 --> 41:28.660
Secure from General Quarters.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.667
Maybe you'’d be faster
if we did this in the middle
of the night.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.103
What you don'’t
seem to understand

41:37.277 --> 41:39.235
is that someday soon,
this is gonna be real.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.629
And you have to do
a hell of a lot better
than that!

41:41.803 --> 41:43.762
[all] Yes, sir.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.329
All right.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.244
[sailor] I gotta
run him down to 2-A.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.377
I am getting tired
of getting ready.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.597
Tired of living in this
floating sardine can.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.250
Tired of you
smelling like one.

41:54.424 --> 41:55.687
That'’s what
men smell like.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.645
Something to look forward to
one day, Fritz.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.386
Most excitement
we'’ve seen in days.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.996
[Captain Sisson]
Ensign Brown.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.434
Could I speak to you
for a moment?

42:04.609 --> 42:06.524
Careful what you wish for.

42:06.698 --> 42:08.351
[sailor] I'’ll go ahead
and respot it.

42:10.571 --> 42:11.572
Aye, sir.

42:12.442 --> 42:13.487
Huh.

42:20.102 --> 42:21.103
[camera pops]

42:25.368 --> 42:27.196
Do we have to do this
above deck?

42:27.370 --> 42:29.982
Oh, yeah.
It'’s great having you
right in front of your plane.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.157
Relax.
You look great.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.072
[Tom] What'’s going on?

42:33.246 --> 42:35.161
[Dick] Lifemagazine is here.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.859
I guess the Pentagon wanted
something positive for
the folks back home.

42:38.033 --> 42:41.384
Help '’em swallow the pill
of another potential war.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.996
What better way than,
"Black man makes good?"

42:44.170 --> 42:46.781
He does makes
a nice trophy boy.
You ought to be proud, Skip.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.698
Shut up, Bo.

42:50.872 --> 42:54.267
[journalist] Your commanding
officer called you one of the
best pilots he'’s ever seen,

42:54.441 --> 42:55.790
regardless of color.

42:55.964 --> 42:57.749
[officer on PA]
Flight checks and FOD walks

42:57.923 --> 42:59.838
for fixed-wing
and rotary aircraft
must be documented.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.364
That'’s kind of him to say,
but I can'’t say I'’m special.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.801
Well,
it must be hard, right?

43:06.975 --> 43:08.150
It must be hard
being the only--

43:08.324 --> 43:11.023
A naval aviator? Absolutely.

43:11.197 --> 43:13.765
Landing planes on carriers,
it'’s the--

43:13.939 --> 43:16.594
it'’s the toughest job there is
for anyone wearing wings.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.295
[officer on PA]
Heavy maintenance visit

43:22.469 --> 43:24.210
will be performed
in all aircraft...

43:24.384 --> 43:26.299
Come on, Ensign Brown.
You know what I mean.Jesse'’s fine.

43:26.473 --> 43:27.996
Okay, Jesse.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.955
There'’s a lot of guys
from different backgrounds,

43:30.129 --> 43:31.478
but there'’s only one you.

43:31.652 --> 43:33.262
There'’s only
one you, too, sir.
[chuckles]

43:34.350 --> 43:36.439
Look, I mean no disrespect,

43:36.614 --> 43:39.704
but I don'’t think I'’m gonna say
what you'’re looking
for me to say.

43:41.270 --> 43:42.358
All right.

43:42.532 --> 43:43.664
I worked hard
to fly these planes.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.231
It'’s all I'’ve ever wanted to do.

43:45.405 --> 43:47.146
Harder than I can
put into words.[Dick] Jesse.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.496
Can we get
a few more pictures
of Jesse in his plane?

43:49.670 --> 43:50.889
I gotta get my pilots
back to work.

43:51.063 --> 43:52.717
It'’ll just take
a minute, Lieutenant.

43:52.891 --> 43:54.675
Lieutenant Commander.
Have a nice day.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.068
[sailor]
Watch your back!

43:57.286 --> 43:59.375
Damn, Jesse. You just put
a letter in the mail.

43:59.549 --> 44:01.421
One a week.

44:01.595 --> 44:02.988
That'’s what I told her.

44:03.162 --> 44:04.729
[Carol] It'’s no use trying
to slow him down.

44:04.903 --> 44:06.600
[chattering]

44:06.774 --> 44:09.037
Hey, we caught
your little circus act
up on deck.

44:09.211 --> 44:10.517
[chuckling]

44:10.691 --> 44:12.171
Your boy juggle, too?
Or...

44:12.345 --> 44:14.086
[shoes tap]

44:14.260 --> 44:15.348
[laughs]

44:41.243 --> 44:42.157
[scoffs]

44:42.331 --> 44:43.463
[laughs]

44:44.856 --> 44:46.074
Guess not.

44:48.076 --> 44:50.775
[marine scoffs]
Well. Nice.

44:53.603 --> 44:55.693
We should have
stood up to
that asshole.

44:57.042 --> 44:58.478
[Jesse] I'’m good, Tom.

45:06.268 --> 45:09.010
Look, I'’m just saying
we shouldn'’t be letting
him run his mouth like that.

45:37.038 --> 45:38.039
[Carol sighs]

45:44.654 --> 45:46.918
[Dick] Now, I know
that you'’re all sick
of doing busywork,

45:47.092 --> 45:50.182
but, oh, have I
got a chore for
a lucky someone.

45:50.356 --> 45:51.923
Not it.Maintenance has replaced

45:52.097 --> 45:53.533
a gyro on one of the Corsairs,

45:53.707 --> 45:55.448
I need a volunteer to
make sure all is working.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.363
It'’s just a quick
up and down.I thought you said "lucky."

45:57.537 --> 45:59.060
It sounds like
a hoot.

45:59.234 --> 46:00.627
Why don'’t we
give it to Fritz?

46:01.454 --> 46:02.890
He could use the landing.

46:03.064 --> 46:05.066
[all chuckling]I'’ll do it.

46:05.806 --> 46:06.807
[Dick] All right.

46:08.026 --> 46:09.114
Actually,

46:09.288 --> 46:10.463
if you don'’t mind,
Lieutenant,

46:11.986 --> 46:13.118
Lavery'’s right for once.

46:13.292 --> 46:14.075
'’Course I'’m right.

46:14.249 --> 46:15.773
I could use the trap.

46:16.643 --> 46:17.862
All yours.

46:18.036 --> 46:19.211
Heil Herr Mohring!

46:19.385 --> 46:21.082
[Dick] Mohring it is.[Marty] All right.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.650
All right, now as for
the rest of you,

46:23.824 --> 46:25.347
command has
ordered an audit

46:25.521 --> 46:28.350
on serial numbers
on parts across
all of the planes.

46:28.524 --> 46:30.657
So while Mohring is
up there enjoying
the sightseeing,

46:30.831 --> 46:34.139
the rest of you can
validate all of
the serial numbers

46:34.313 --> 46:36.532
on every single one of
these maintenance orders.

46:36.706 --> 46:39.144
[all groaning]Thank you, Matthew.

46:39.318 --> 46:40.798
Yeah.[Bo] Uh, sir?

46:40.972 --> 46:42.364
That'’ll take all day.

46:42.538 --> 46:44.062
Only if you work quick.

47:03.690 --> 47:04.865
[flight officer]
Ensign Mohring,

47:05.039 --> 47:06.345
you are clear
to test the gyro.

47:29.107 --> 47:30.673
2-17 to tower.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.327
Gyro seems to be
in working order.

47:32.501 --> 47:33.938
[flight officer]
Copy that.
Return to carrier.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.085
Ensign Mohring,
your approach is shallow.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.261
I'’m correcting.

47:55.350 --> 47:56.699
Manufacture number?

47:59.659 --> 48:02.662
"P-5-5-1-8-4."

48:07.754 --> 48:08.886
What is it?

48:17.764 --> 48:18.765
[breathing heavily]

48:19.809 --> 48:20.985
[Jesse] Not gonna
make the deck.

48:21.159 --> 48:22.247
[Tom] He'’ll make it.

48:22.421 --> 48:23.813
Just gotta slowly
pour on the power.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.337
On this approach?

48:28.470 --> 48:29.819
Better to wave off.

48:30.516 --> 48:31.909
Try again.

48:32.083 --> 48:34.563
[flight officer on PA]
Crash crew, stand by.

48:34.737 --> 48:35.956
Crash crew, stand by.

48:36.130 --> 48:37.305
[crew 3] Man your station.

48:40.482 --> 48:42.528
Out of the way.
Coming in.

48:43.181 --> 48:44.182
[inhales sharply]

48:47.272 --> 48:49.535
[flight officer on radio]
You'’re still low, Mohring.

48:53.843 --> 48:55.933
[crew chattering]

48:58.152 --> 48:59.371
Go around, pal.

49:00.894 --> 49:02.243
Ease it on, Mohring.

49:07.074 --> 49:09.163
[flight officer]
Ensign Mohring,
give me some altitude.

49:10.730 --> 49:12.210
[grunts] No, no, no, no, no!

49:13.428 --> 49:14.603
[crashes]

49:14.777 --> 49:16.214
[grunts][crew 5] He'’s in the water.

49:16.388 --> 49:18.303
[crew 6] Man overboard![crew 7] Get your vest pack!

49:18.477 --> 49:19.521
[crew 8] We need rescue!

49:19.695 --> 49:21.349
Poured on the power
too damn fast.

49:21.523 --> 49:22.916
[alarm blaring]

49:23.090 --> 49:25.223
[crash crew shouting]

49:30.097 --> 49:31.794
[crew] Let'’s go, let'’s go!

49:32.752 --> 49:33.971
[crew 8] Do we pull him out?

49:34.145 --> 49:35.276
[alarm continues]

49:56.384 --> 49:59.300
Some people are gonna
tell you that this is
what you signed up for.

50:00.606 --> 50:01.607
It'’s not.

50:03.174 --> 50:04.566
Let'’s be real clear.

50:05.567 --> 50:06.960
We lost a friend.

50:07.134 --> 50:08.353
And that is not easy.

50:08.875 --> 50:09.919
Now,

50:10.964 --> 50:12.879
the Navy'’s gonna do
what the Navy does.

50:13.575 --> 50:14.489
But, um...

50:14.663 --> 50:16.056
I'’ll write his family.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.980
Send them his things.

50:42.648 --> 50:43.736
[sighs]

50:48.436 --> 50:49.872
The guys are getting together.

51:08.021 --> 51:09.327
Just because you think
you know better

51:09.501 --> 51:11.459
doesn'’t mean you
have to say anything.

51:13.853 --> 51:15.985
What are you talking about?[sniffles]

51:16.160 --> 51:18.162
Carol hadn'’t been
in the water
five seconds

51:18.336 --> 51:20.512
before you were
talking about what
he could'’ve done better.

51:20.686 --> 51:22.470
We all make mistakes.
That could'’ve been me,
that--

51:25.995 --> 51:28.563
Don'’t let that ring
convince you otherwise.

51:28.737 --> 51:30.696
What'’s the one thing
they told us about
the Corsair?

51:30.870 --> 51:32.524
Remind me.
What'’d they tell us
about the Corsair?

51:32.698 --> 51:34.003
You can'’t punch
the throttle.

51:34.178 --> 51:36.136
Mistakes get
us killed, Jesse.

51:40.009 --> 51:41.924
You don'’t die
if you do
what you'’re told.

51:43.752 --> 51:44.840
[Marty] Fellas.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.409
You coming?

51:59.116 --> 52:00.378
To Carol.

52:37.284 --> 52:39.634
[Tom]
We'’re not even at war,
and we'’re losing men.

52:40.853 --> 52:42.115
Good men.

52:45.336 --> 52:46.511
It'’s just a
tough pill to swallow

52:46.685 --> 52:48.165
when there'’s
nothing to blame.

52:54.214 --> 52:56.260
The swim test
in flight school...

53:03.223 --> 53:05.225
They made me do it ten times.

53:11.927 --> 53:14.234
Didn'’t believe that
a nigger could swim.

53:16.628 --> 53:18.282
They dumped ice in the water.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.461
Put weights
in my flight suit.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.379
Held me under.

53:32.992 --> 53:35.299
They wouldn'’t have cared
if I died in that pool.

53:38.476 --> 53:39.955
But every time...

53:42.567 --> 53:43.655
I made it out.

53:54.970 --> 53:58.452
Got used to flying
the Bearcat. [chuckles]

54:00.759 --> 54:01.890
See everything.

54:02.717 --> 54:04.066
The deck on approach.

54:05.546 --> 54:07.461
[sniffles] All right
in front of me.

54:07.635 --> 54:10.334
I could land it on
my front yard if I had to.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.080
But the Corsair...

54:25.000 --> 54:26.350
I can'’t see anything.

54:29.396 --> 54:31.006
You have to
rely on the LSO.

54:32.051 --> 54:33.444
[Jesse] Hard to believe
that the LSO

54:33.618 --> 54:35.968
won'’t crash my Black ass
on purpose.

54:40.668 --> 54:41.800
I can'’t tell you
how many times

54:41.974 --> 54:43.715
people have told me
to give up, quit.

54:44.890 --> 54:46.021
Die, even.

54:48.937 --> 54:51.679
That'’s why you can'’t always
do what you'’re told.

54:55.596 --> 54:57.598
If I did, I wouldn'’t be here.

55:01.994 --> 55:03.038
[sighs]

55:05.867 --> 55:08.305
That'’s something
I was trying to teach Mohring.

55:15.442 --> 55:16.443
[sniffles]

55:42.469 --> 55:43.601
[Dick] You guys are tired.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.907
I see it. Hell, I am, too.

55:46.081 --> 55:47.431
Been a rough few weeks.

55:48.954 --> 55:51.217
Fortunately,
we are docking in Cannes

55:51.391 --> 55:52.958
for a little shore leave.

55:53.132 --> 55:54.742
Now,
I don'’t know about you,

55:54.916 --> 55:56.570
but I think
some fresh air would
do all of us some good.

55:56.744 --> 55:59.356
[pilot whistles]Obviously, ship rules
follow you ashore.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.227
Liberty expires at 2300.[chuckles]

56:01.401 --> 56:04.186
You are foreigners
in a foreign city,
and you look the part.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.450
So please, Marty,
please, dear God,

56:06.624 --> 56:08.669
don'’t do anything stupid.Mm-hmm.

56:08.843 --> 56:10.889
Oh, and, uh, no,
I don'’t wanna come with you

56:11.063 --> 56:12.630
and do whatever is it
that you'’re gonna do,

56:12.804 --> 56:13.848
but thank you.[chuckles]

56:14.022 --> 56:15.546
Go away.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.809
[big band music playing]

56:17.983 --> 56:19.506
[chattering]

56:21.029 --> 56:23.902
Don'’t let Cevoli
catch you selling
those to the locals.

56:24.076 --> 56:25.599
Let me tell you something.

56:25.773 --> 56:28.646
I'’ve been in the Navy
since I was 16.

56:28.820 --> 56:31.126
And our line of work
is a dangerous one.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.824
One where tomorrow
is never promised.

56:32.998 --> 56:34.913
Hell, tomorrow'’s barely
a gentleman'’s agreement.

56:36.131 --> 56:38.830
So if there'’s liberty
to be had... [chuckles]

56:39.004 --> 56:40.832
...then liberty
we should take.

56:42.007 --> 56:43.791
At two dollars a pack,
I'’ll take a risk.

56:46.490 --> 56:48.448
Let'’s enjoy ourselves, boys.

56:48.622 --> 56:49.841
Mohring would insist.

56:50.711 --> 56:52.278
When in France.

56:52.452 --> 56:54.411
There he is.Tom.

57:08.033 --> 57:10.252
[sailor 1] Don'’t do anything
I wouldn'’t do, sailor.

57:20.828 --> 57:21.873
[Marty] What
do we have here?

57:22.047 --> 57:23.222
Hello.

57:23.396 --> 57:24.832
[Bo] At the Boulevard
de la Croissant.

57:25.006 --> 57:27.182
Few too many sailors
on this street.

57:27.356 --> 57:29.271
[Bo] Doesn'’t look like
a street with
a whorehouse on it.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.317
[chuckling] No.[Marty] You don'’t have
enough scratch or game

57:31.491 --> 57:33.232
for these fine European women.

57:33.406 --> 57:35.930
Hey, I'’m here to drink,
so just point me
in that direction.

57:36.104 --> 57:38.063
Oh, to the first bar
we find, then.

57:38.237 --> 57:40.195
You guys go ahead.

57:40.369 --> 57:42.154
I gotta find something
for Daisy.

57:44.112 --> 57:45.723
I'’ll catch up.All right.

57:45.897 --> 57:48.421
Hey, don'’t forget
the, uh, lacy bits.

57:48.595 --> 57:49.857
Funny.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.381
[biker speaking French]

57:57.517 --> 57:59.345
[beachgoers chattering]

58:01.521 --> 58:03.001
[child speaking French]

58:27.721 --> 58:28.983
What'’s going on?

58:29.157 --> 58:31.116
Are you blind?
It'’s Liz Taylor.

58:31.290 --> 58:32.813
The movie star.
Where the hell have you been?

58:32.987 --> 58:34.162
[laughs] I'’d like that.

58:34.336 --> 58:35.294
Miss Taylor.Mmm.

58:35.468 --> 58:36.600
Would you sign
my postcard?

58:36.774 --> 58:38.776
Oh, I don'’t do
signatures, darling.

58:38.950 --> 58:40.473
But I'’ll
give you a kiss.

58:40.647 --> 58:41.822
[chuckles]

58:43.345 --> 58:44.564
Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

58:44.738 --> 58:45.783
And who'’s your friend?

58:46.348 --> 58:47.698
He ain'’t with me.

58:47.872 --> 58:50.483
Ensign Jesse Brown, ma'’am.

58:52.790 --> 58:54.139
I'’m a naval aviator.

58:54.313 --> 58:56.358
Oh, they let colored folks
be pilots these days?

58:57.055 --> 58:58.056
It would appear so.

58:58.230 --> 58:59.579
Well, how enlightened.

58:59.753 --> 59:01.015
Liz?

59:02.495 --> 59:04.149
I have to run, dear,

59:04.323 --> 59:06.934
but you and your wingmen
should join us
at the casino later.

59:07.108 --> 59:08.414
I like pilots.

59:09.110 --> 59:10.329
Miss Elizabeth?

59:12.157 --> 59:13.680
I'’m sure
you'’ve noticed, but--

59:13.854 --> 59:15.290
You just wear
something smart,

59:15.464 --> 59:18.293
and you tell them
Elizabeth invited you.

59:25.257 --> 59:26.563
[chuckles]

59:28.086 --> 59:29.827
[chattering in French]

59:31.002 --> 59:32.481
You'’re thinking it.[chuckles]

59:34.309 --> 59:35.484
Ah, look who it is.

59:36.616 --> 59:37.574
Get something nice
for Daisy?

59:37.748 --> 59:39.488
Yeah, got something else, too.

59:39.663 --> 59:42.274
I was invited to
the Casino de Carlo
this evening.

59:42.448 --> 59:43.971
We all were, actually.

59:45.930 --> 59:47.845
By Elizabeth Taylor.[Bo] You'’re shitting me.

59:48.019 --> 59:49.107
Wait, Liz Taylor,
the actress?

59:49.281 --> 59:50.369
How? Where?

59:50.543 --> 59:52.589
How? Met her.
Where? At the beach.

59:53.546 --> 59:54.547
Nice lady, actually.

59:54.721 --> 59:56.418
[laughs]I don'’t believe you.

59:57.289 --> 59:58.507
But I got
some money to blow.

59:58.682 --> 59:59.770
Let'’s see if you'’re lying.

59:59.944 --> 1:00:01.162
[Bo] Now we'’re talking.

1:00:01.336 --> 1:00:02.990
Put up or shut up.

1:00:12.391 --> 1:00:13.435
Fellas.

1:00:16.264 --> 1:00:17.135
Let'’s get dressed. Whoo!

1:00:17.309 --> 1:00:19.050
[Bill] Wow.

1:00:27.754 --> 1:00:31.149
Now, I know y'’all are used
to getting turned down,
but I ain'’t.

1:00:31.323 --> 1:00:33.455
If we don'’t get in,
doubt this is
the only place in town.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.588
Yeah, but this is the only
place with Liz Taylor.

1:00:35.762 --> 1:00:37.111
Allegedly.

1:00:37.285 --> 1:00:39.418
[speaking French]

1:00:39.592 --> 1:00:40.898
We were invited.

1:00:41.899 --> 1:00:44.292
I am certain
you were not.

1:00:47.426 --> 1:00:49.428
Elizabeth Taylor.
I believe she--Please, sir,

1:00:49.602 --> 1:00:51.648
leave now.Jesse.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:56.043
It'’s okay.
We'’ll go find somewhere else.

1:00:58.002 --> 1:00:59.003
Right.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:00.918
Okay.

1:01:01.570 --> 1:01:03.485
[speaking French]

1:01:21.068 --> 1:01:23.027
[security guard speaking French]
[clears throat]

1:01:24.942 --> 1:01:25.943
This way.

1:01:27.553 --> 1:01:30.425
[jazz music plays]

1:01:30.599 --> 1:01:32.514
You sly dog.

1:01:33.124 --> 1:01:34.125
Never in doubt.

1:01:38.825 --> 1:01:39.826
[speaks French]

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:43.482
Did you see her? This is...Oh, man!

1:01:44.657 --> 1:01:46.180
Women here are...

1:01:47.486 --> 1:01:49.096
[Bill] I think it'’s time
to make a little money.

1:01:49.270 --> 1:01:52.709
Oh, look at this place!
I think we found the party.

1:01:55.973 --> 1:01:58.889
-[partygoer] Oh, no!
-[crowd shouts]

1:02:02.327 --> 1:02:03.937
Is that...Liz Taylor.

1:02:06.635 --> 1:02:07.767
That'’s Liz Taylor!Liz Taylor.

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:10.639
That'’s Liz Taylor?
She look nice.

1:02:11.466 --> 1:02:12.729
Guess I should introduce you.

1:02:13.686 --> 1:02:14.774
[Bo] Yep.

1:02:14.948 --> 1:02:16.167
Fellas?[Marty] Mm-hmm?

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:22.303
[Bill] Never met a movie star.
Kinda nervous.

1:02:22.477 --> 1:02:24.131
Well, lookie-loo.

1:02:24.305 --> 1:02:25.742
The Fighting 32.

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:28.222
You came!

1:02:28.832 --> 1:02:29.833
Yes, ma'’am.

1:02:32.313 --> 1:02:33.967
Do you gentlemen
all know each other?

1:02:34.141 --> 1:02:35.534
Just sharing space
at the moment, ma'’am.

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:38.189
That'’s right.
Until the actual war starts.

1:02:38.363 --> 1:02:40.060
And then,
we'’ll be on the ground.

1:02:40.234 --> 1:02:42.019
And they'’ll be nowhere
to be found.

1:02:42.193 --> 1:02:43.977
[scoffs] You always talk
in nursery rhymes?

1:02:44.151 --> 1:02:46.284
Please, take a seat.

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:48.852
I could use some
fresh luck anyway.

1:02:49.635 --> 1:02:50.636
Yes, ma'’am.

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:52.290
Please.

1:02:59.427 --> 1:03:01.429
Okay. Why don'’t you
and I grab a drink

1:03:01.603 --> 1:03:04.911
and toast to not being
on a ship with these guys?

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:06.304
Come on.Good idea.

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:07.827
Buy a couple rounds on us.

1:03:09.742 --> 1:03:11.048
I'’ll keep your seat warm.

1:03:13.702 --> 1:03:15.226
[Elizabeth] Put some here.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.663
Let'’s go, Buddy.
Come on.[Elizabeth] Here. And...

1:03:19.230 --> 1:03:20.057
[Jesse] Here.

1:03:20.231 --> 1:03:22.363
[whirring]

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:23.582
[Elizabeth] Here.

1:03:30.632 --> 1:03:32.243
[all cheer]

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:34.245
[gasps]

1:03:35.507 --> 1:03:37.074
My lucky man.

1:03:40.251 --> 1:03:41.818
[Marty] Oh, here we go.

1:03:42.819 --> 1:03:44.168
Cheers, ladies.

1:03:44.342 --> 1:03:45.822
To beautiful people,
beautiful life.Cheers.

1:03:45.996 --> 1:03:48.128
Yes, cheers.New friends,
future ex-wives.

1:03:48.302 --> 1:03:50.087
Here we go. Hey![laughs]

1:03:50.261 --> 1:03:53.873
[whirring]

1:03:54.047 --> 1:03:55.266
Whoo![all cheer]

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:56.658
[Bo] Mm-hmm.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:58.225
That'’s what we call
a winner.

1:03:59.923 --> 1:04:01.315
Come on!

1:04:01.489 --> 1:04:03.230
About time
to call it a night, Bubba.

1:04:03.404 --> 1:04:04.449
Yes!

1:04:05.493 --> 1:04:06.538
Oh, shit.

1:04:10.063 --> 1:04:11.325
[speaking French]

1:04:11.499 --> 1:04:13.762
[both chuckle]

1:04:15.939 --> 1:04:19.420
So, you speak French.

1:04:19.594 --> 1:04:21.074
I picked it up
in high school.

1:04:22.989 --> 1:04:24.382
Uh, sir. Uh, whiskey,

1:04:24.556 --> 1:04:26.732
and then,
whatever my friend'’s having.

1:04:29.343 --> 1:04:34.871
[speaking French]

1:04:38.352 --> 1:04:39.614
Show off.

1:04:40.441 --> 1:04:41.399
That was pretty good.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:44.489
It'’s good.[both laugh]

1:04:46.839 --> 1:04:48.145
Pretty wild.

1:04:48.319 --> 1:04:51.278
Rubbing shoulders
with movie stars.

1:04:51.452 --> 1:04:52.801
Drinking, gambling.

1:04:54.281 --> 1:04:56.196
The Reds are
about to strike,

1:04:56.370 --> 1:04:57.894
we'’re partying in France.

1:04:58.938 --> 1:04:59.983
[sighs]

1:05:01.506 --> 1:05:04.204
I just want to go home
with this having
meant something.

1:05:04.378 --> 1:05:05.336
Well...

1:05:06.598 --> 1:05:08.905
You just keep it up
with Miss Liz Taylor,

1:05:10.167 --> 1:05:11.081
and you just might.

1:05:11.255 --> 1:05:12.778
[both laugh]

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:15.955
Thank you.

1:05:16.825 --> 1:05:18.305
You forgot the ginger beer.

1:05:18.479 --> 1:05:19.916
I saw a place
looked real nice.

1:05:20.090 --> 1:05:21.787
I'’ll get a drink from there.

1:05:21.961 --> 1:05:23.136
Hey, pal.Let'’s try that.

1:05:23.832 --> 1:05:24.877
Let'’s try that.

1:05:27.793 --> 1:05:29.447
Change of scenery,
fellas.

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:31.928
As long as this place
has French women,
I'’m happy.

1:05:32.102 --> 1:05:33.407
We'’ll be jake on that front.

1:05:33.581 --> 1:05:35.235
Right, I lost
all my money anyway.
Come on.

1:05:35.409 --> 1:05:36.454
-[Bo] We'’re leaving?
-Sorry.

1:05:36.628 --> 1:05:37.846
Excuse me?

1:05:38.021 --> 1:05:40.806
Miss Elizabeth,
thank you for having us.

1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:42.590
It was very kind of you.

1:05:42.764 --> 1:05:44.418
Well, is that it for you boys?

1:05:44.592 --> 1:05:46.159
I'’m afraid so.

1:05:46.333 --> 1:05:49.032
Hmm. Well,
you be safe out there.

1:05:54.341 --> 1:05:55.342
Would you?

1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:57.344
[blows]

1:05:57.518 --> 1:05:58.563
Thank you.

1:06:00.826 --> 1:06:02.088
[dice clatters]

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:04.264
[laughs]

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:09.226
[Tom] We'’re a little outside
the liberty area.

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:11.750
I won'’t tell if you don'’t,
Lieutenant. Voilà!

1:06:11.924 --> 1:06:13.230
[Jesse] Oh!

1:06:13.404 --> 1:06:15.536
Voilà, voilà! Look at that.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:16.973
[Bo] How'’d you find this place?

1:06:17.147 --> 1:06:18.322
[clears throat]

1:06:18.496 --> 1:06:20.628
[chattering]

1:06:20.802 --> 1:06:22.979
Bonjour.Ladies.

1:06:23.153 --> 1:06:24.154
[Bill] You behave.

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:29.028
Uh, whiskey, please.

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:32.989
[Bo] Careful.

1:06:39.299 --> 1:06:40.866
Hmm. [chuckles]

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:42.215
[Bo] Ladies!

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:44.609
And drinks.Here you go.

1:06:47.394 --> 1:06:48.395
[exhales]

1:06:50.484 --> 1:06:53.705
So you gotta use what ya got.

1:06:58.144 --> 1:07:01.234
Being handsome
helped me land Daisy,
but you?

1:07:02.409 --> 1:07:03.541
[smacks lips]

1:07:03.715 --> 1:07:05.456
You?

1:07:05.630 --> 1:07:08.589
We'’re gonna need
a different approach.[chuckles]

1:07:08.763 --> 1:07:09.764
How about...

1:07:10.809 --> 1:07:14.595
You'’re an American aviator
in France?

1:07:15.553 --> 1:07:16.771
That'’s all I got?

1:07:16.945 --> 1:07:18.512
Gotta play to
your strengths, Lieutenant.

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:20.036
Sir.

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:24.040
You'’re without your wings.

1:07:24.214 --> 1:07:26.346
[laughs] You gotta be
kidding me.

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.044
No, no, Jesse,
I'’m not takin'’ your wings.

1:07:28.218 --> 1:07:29.262
Just borrowing.

1:07:30.611 --> 1:07:34.050
Plus, my CO refused
to pin '’em on me
during graduation,

1:07:34.224 --> 1:07:37.053
so they'’re not
that sentimental.

1:07:40.143 --> 1:07:41.535
Now, at least
you look the part.

1:07:42.232 --> 1:07:43.233
[chuckles]

1:07:47.846 --> 1:07:50.283
What about
a magic trick?Magic trick?

1:07:50.457 --> 1:07:52.372
Yeah.You know magic tricks?

1:07:53.243 --> 1:07:55.332
I-- I know '’em.
I know...

1:07:55.506 --> 1:07:56.550
Yes or no?It'’s a magic trick.

1:07:56.724 --> 1:07:58.248
You know a magic trick?Yeah.

1:08:01.033 --> 1:08:02.208
[both laugh]

1:08:02.382 --> 1:08:04.123
Like I said,
you gotta use what you got.

1:08:04.297 --> 1:08:06.560
[chattering]

1:08:07.822 --> 1:08:09.824
[speaking French]

1:08:09.998 --> 1:08:11.522
"It'’s my first time
in France."

1:08:13.350 --> 1:08:15.047
[both speaking French]

1:08:15.221 --> 1:08:16.395
[coughs]

1:08:16.569 --> 1:08:18.180
Sorry.It'’s okay.
[laughs]

1:08:18.354 --> 1:08:19.399
Just say, "Bonjour."

1:08:19.573 --> 1:08:20.792
Bonjour. Bonjour.

1:08:26.493 --> 1:08:28.278
Bonjour. Bonjour.

1:08:28.452 --> 1:08:29.366
[clears throat]

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:30.584
I'’d like to, um,

1:08:30.758 --> 1:08:32.846
treat you ladies
to a magic trick.

1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:34.675
It'’s called the, uh,

1:08:34.849 --> 1:08:36.286
Fire Breathing Aviator.

1:08:36.460 --> 1:08:38.331
[both chuckle]

1:08:41.899 --> 1:08:44.250
Oh, la, la.[both laugh]

1:08:44.424 --> 1:08:45.381
[speaks French]

1:08:45.555 --> 1:08:47.645
[Tom chuckles]

1:08:48.776 --> 1:08:50.037
[Marty] You know Frank Sinatra?

1:08:51.214 --> 1:08:54.304
He'’s my third cousin.
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:08:54.478 --> 1:08:56.783
I don'’t sound like him,
but I sure as hell
look like him, right?

1:08:56.957 --> 1:08:58.612
Looks better on you.
You'’re the pilot in command.

1:08:58.786 --> 1:09:01.658
[Bo] Bordeaux?
Baby, I don'’t drink wine. No.

1:09:01.832 --> 1:09:04.227
Forgive my uncultured friend.
He doesn'’t know a damn thing.

1:09:04.879 --> 1:09:06.316
Stick to whiskey.

1:09:22.287 --> 1:09:23.636
Oh, they let you in here?

1:09:26.944 --> 1:09:29.817
You know, I had something
going with Liz
before y'’all showed up.

1:09:29.991 --> 1:09:31.341
[chuckles]

1:09:32.993 --> 1:09:34.256
I think she'’s married.

1:09:35.693 --> 1:09:37.173
Something funny, sideshow?

1:09:37.346 --> 1:09:39.131
Excuse me,
just give me one second.

1:09:39.305 --> 1:09:41.524
You'’re the one
that brought the circus.

1:09:42.700 --> 1:09:44.310
[Tom] Hey.

1:09:44.484 --> 1:09:46.529
What'’s going on?[Jesse] Nothing.

1:09:46.703 --> 1:09:47.792
Everything'’s fine.

1:09:47.966 --> 1:09:49.488
You need your
pansy-ass friend here

1:09:49.662 --> 1:09:51.011
to help you out?Hey.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:52.144
All right,
we can cool it.

1:09:52.318 --> 1:09:53.450
We'’ve all been drinking.

1:09:53.624 --> 1:09:55.495
Tom. I'’m good.[Marty] Hey, hey.

1:09:55.669 --> 1:09:57.149
I-- I know.

1:09:57.323 --> 1:09:58.542
Yeah, but you won'’t be
after I'’m done with you.

1:09:58.716 --> 1:09:59.934
[grunts]

1:10:00.108 --> 1:10:02.154
-[Marty] Back up! Tom!
-[Buddy] Come on!

1:10:02.328 --> 1:10:03.895
Come on!Oh, sorry.

1:10:04.069 --> 1:10:05.157
[Bill] Tom!
There'’s someone there.

1:10:05.331 --> 1:10:06.985
[Tom] Come on!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1:10:07.159 --> 1:10:09.292
[Peters] Come on!
Let go of him! Hey! Hey![whistle blows]

1:10:09.466 --> 1:10:11.032
[Bo] Come on, boys,
we gotta go!Stop! Stop!

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:13.078
-[Bo] Come on! Let'’s go! Run!
-[Marty] We gotta go. Run!

1:10:13.252 --> 1:10:14.645
[Tom] Ah, shoot, your wings.

1:10:14.819 --> 1:10:16.168
-[Marty] Y'’all lucky!
-[Buddy] Let'’s go!

1:10:16.342 --> 1:10:17.256
Hustle, ladies!

1:10:17.430 --> 1:10:19.693
Oh, um. [laughs]

1:10:19.867 --> 1:10:22.218
Tom, come on!
Tom, that way! That way!

1:10:22.392 --> 1:10:23.871
Oh, God!Go, go, go!

1:10:24.045 --> 1:10:29.050
[siren wailing]

1:10:32.924 --> 1:10:34.404
[Tom] You know
how I do that trick?

1:10:35.709 --> 1:10:36.971
I eat the cigarette.

1:10:38.712 --> 1:10:40.236
You didn'’t have to do that.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:42.455
I got the kiss.

1:10:44.414 --> 1:10:45.937
I wish you hadn'’t hit him.

1:10:48.069 --> 1:10:49.767
You would'’ve done
the same for me.

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:00.821
Not hunting
for a thank you.

1:11:00.995 --> 1:11:02.519
You were hunting
for a fight though.

1:11:02.693 --> 1:11:04.129
Defending my wingman.

1:11:11.005 --> 1:11:12.703
I can fight my own fights.

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:16.228
Been doing it
for a long time now.

1:11:29.067 --> 1:11:30.111
Jesse Brown.

1:11:30.982 --> 1:11:32.331
Squadron of one.

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:42.254
Ready room. ASAP.
Something big'’s going down.

1:11:43.429 --> 1:11:44.430
[grunts]

1:11:49.087 --> 1:11:50.218
[sighs]

1:11:51.524 --> 1:11:54.397
[Dick] I hope that you all
had fun last night,

1:11:54.571 --> 1:11:58.749
because the North Koreans
came pouring over
the 38th Parallel.

1:11:58.923 --> 1:12:00.272
They have taken Seoul.

1:12:00.446 --> 1:12:02.274
If they take the rest of
the southern peninsula,

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:05.408
it'’s on to Japan,
and there go our efforts
to contain communism,

1:12:05.582 --> 1:12:06.670
so says Washington.

1:12:06.844 --> 1:12:08.454
So, what does that
mean for us?

1:12:08.628 --> 1:12:09.586
It means we'’re up.

1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:12.110
We'’re setting sail for Korea.

1:12:12.284 --> 1:12:13.851
Now, I know that
for almost all of you,

1:12:14.025 --> 1:12:16.332
this will be the first time
you'’re seeing combat.

1:12:17.245 --> 1:12:18.769
Your training
is important, yes.

1:12:18.943 --> 1:12:21.424
And you are sure as hell ready
to do what you need to do.

1:12:21.598 --> 1:12:22.990
I made sure of that.

1:12:23.164 --> 1:12:25.384
But the most
important thing is this:

1:12:25.558 --> 1:12:27.168
we bring everyone home.

1:12:28.518 --> 1:12:31.042
We bring everyone home.

1:12:40.878 --> 1:12:44.360
[Dick] Brass is worried
there may be as many as
100,000 Chinese

1:12:44.534 --> 1:12:48.015
already in North Korea,
ready to take up the fight
at a moment'’s notice.

1:12:48.189 --> 1:12:50.670
MacArthur ordered B-29'’s
to take out two bridges

1:12:50.844 --> 1:12:53.020
along the Yalu River,
on the border,

1:12:53.194 --> 1:12:56.154
hoping to slow the Chinese
from sending in
any more troops.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:57.329
But they missed.

1:12:57.503 --> 1:12:59.636
So, I will lead
the Fighting 32.

1:12:59.810 --> 1:13:02.465
We will take out
the antiaircraft
in Sinuiju City.

1:13:02.639 --> 1:13:04.771
Tarsiers, you will fly support
for the Panthers

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:07.600
until it is safe for them
to come in and bomb
those bridges.

1:13:07.774 --> 1:13:09.646
This is just a friendly
reminder, gentlemen.

1:13:09.820 --> 1:13:12.388
Don'’t shoot or bomb anything
on the Chinese side
of the river,

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:14.433
unless you wanna be
personally responsible

1:13:14.607 --> 1:13:16.435
for starting another
world war.

1:13:16.609 --> 1:13:18.872
We'’re flying directly
into gunfire.

1:13:19.046 --> 1:13:20.221
I need everyone sharp.

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:21.875
Be smart.

1:13:22.615 --> 1:13:23.790
Be ready.

1:13:23.964 --> 1:13:25.009
[all] Yes, sir.

1:13:28.142 --> 1:13:33.234
[engines roaring]

1:13:43.201 --> 1:13:45.551
[Dick]
201 to 205. You there?

1:13:45.725 --> 1:13:47.205
[Tom on radio]
Go ahead, 201.

1:13:47.379 --> 1:13:49.163
I seem to be having some trouble
with my landing gear.

1:13:49.337 --> 1:13:50.382
Can you confirm?

1:13:51.688 --> 1:13:53.516
[Tom] Your gear is in transit.

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:56.040
Uh, 201 to rug.

1:13:56.214 --> 1:13:58.695
We got a mechanical issue,
and can'’t lead us
to the mission area.

1:13:58.869 --> 1:14:00.697
Passing the lead to 205.

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:03.569
[Leyte CIC on radio]
Roger, 205. You are cleared
for the downwind.

1:14:08.313 --> 1:14:10.097
Stay on the right side
of the river, Tom.

1:14:10.271 --> 1:14:11.751
Yes, sir.

1:14:31.945 --> 1:14:37.385
[engines roaring]

1:14:41.738 --> 1:14:44.523
[breathes heavily]

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:55.491
[breathes heavily]

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:11.507
[breathes deeply]

1:15:12.333 --> 1:15:13.944
205 is in hot.

1:15:31.091 --> 1:15:32.092
[artillery zipping]

1:15:38.098 --> 1:15:40.013
[grunts]

1:15:53.461 --> 1:15:54.506
[Tom] 205 to Flight.

1:15:55.986 --> 1:15:57.640
Commencing flak
suppression now.

1:15:59.990 --> 1:16:00.991
-Ah!
-[gasps]

1:16:01.165 --> 1:16:02.470
[jets roaring]

1:16:02.645 --> 1:16:03.559
It'’s a MiG!

1:16:06.344 --> 1:16:09.869
Koenig, take Goode and Lavery.
Stay on the AA.

1:16:10.043 --> 1:16:10.783
We'’re on it.

1:16:10.957 --> 1:16:12.263
Jesse, break left.

1:16:12.437 --> 1:16:13.351
Let'’s hose this guy.

1:16:13.525 --> 1:16:14.570
Roger that!

1:16:16.963 --> 1:16:18.225
Happy hunting.

1:16:18.399 --> 1:16:19.575
It'’s Bo time.

1:16:32.370 --> 1:16:33.589
Three good hits.

1:16:33.763 --> 1:16:35.808
Coming around for another
run on the AA.

1:16:44.861 --> 1:16:46.471
See him?[Jesse] Negative.

1:16:47.037 --> 1:16:48.081
I got nothing.

1:16:54.435 --> 1:16:56.786
[engine roaring]

1:16:57.438 --> 1:16:58.744
[machine guns firing]

1:16:58.918 --> 1:17:00.572
Bandit high!
Bandit high!Huh?

1:17:00.746 --> 1:17:01.834
[Jesse] Break!

1:17:15.413 --> 1:17:17.023
Tom! He'’s on me pretty good!

1:17:17.197 --> 1:17:19.417
I'’m gonna bring him to you
through the canyon.

1:17:21.071 --> 1:17:22.594
I say we show him
the lighthouse.

1:17:22.768 --> 1:17:23.769
Meet me in the middle.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:34.911
Enemy AA is silenced.
I repeat, enemy AA
is silenced.

1:17:35.085 --> 1:17:37.435
[Panther lead]
Copy that, Flight Leader.
Approaching target now.

1:17:41.918 --> 1:17:43.006
[breathes heavily] Oh!

1:17:48.838 --> 1:17:51.362
[grunts, breathes heavily]

1:17:51.536 --> 1:17:53.059
Come on.

1:18:13.253 --> 1:18:15.560
[Tom] Okay,
I have a visual on you.

1:18:15.734 --> 1:18:17.867
Break right,
up and hard on my call.

1:18:18.041 --> 1:18:19.477
Roger that!

1:18:31.054 --> 1:18:32.272
Ready, set...

1:18:32.446 --> 1:18:33.839
Hit it![groans]

1:18:35.449 --> 1:18:36.494
[screams]

1:18:39.845 --> 1:18:41.760
[shouts, laughs]

1:18:41.934 --> 1:18:43.066
Good hit, Tom!

1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:46.199
Quite fine, Jesse! Quite fine!

1:18:50.856 --> 1:18:53.337
[Panther lead]
This is Panther lead.
Approaching target.

1:19:10.354 --> 1:19:11.485
[explosion]

1:19:15.968 --> 1:19:17.317
Good hit, good hit.

1:19:17.491 --> 1:19:19.537
Rear bridge is down.
Coming back around.

1:19:22.975 --> 1:19:24.803
[Tom] Let'’s bring it home,
Panthers.

1:19:26.892 --> 1:19:27.893
[machine gun cocks]

1:19:34.247 --> 1:19:37.642
[Panther lead] Flight lead,
we'’ve got AA
coming from the Chinese side.

1:19:37.816 --> 1:19:38.991
[Tom] We can'’t touch '’em.

1:19:39.165 --> 1:19:40.776
Time to bug out.

1:19:40.950 --> 1:19:42.125
[Panther lead]
Roger that.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:58.054
205, I still have ordnance.

1:19:58.794 --> 1:19:59.969
I can hit the bridge.

1:20:00.143 --> 1:20:02.406
It'’s too much AA, 211.
Stand down.

1:20:06.889 --> 1:20:09.021
Jesse, stand down!
That'’s an order!

1:20:26.386 --> 1:20:28.345
[exhales]

1:20:44.404 --> 1:20:46.493
[breathes heavily]

1:21:02.118 --> 1:21:04.207
[speaking Mandarin]

1:21:05.991 --> 1:21:07.732
[breathes heavily]

1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:24.053
[grunts]

1:21:29.449 --> 1:21:30.973
That'’s a direct hit!

1:21:31.147 --> 1:21:33.366
That'’s a direct hit!
Bridge is down!

1:21:33.540 --> 1:21:35.064
[Bo] That a boy, Jesse!

1:21:35.238 --> 1:21:36.543
There we go, ace!

1:21:36.717 --> 1:21:38.981
[Tom] Iroquois, this is 205.

1:21:39.155 --> 1:21:40.939
Both bridges have been
destroyed.

1:21:41.113 --> 1:21:42.680
Returning to ship.

1:21:42.854 --> 1:21:45.509
[Leyte CIC on radio]
Copy that, 205.
Good work.

1:21:48.468 --> 1:21:49.948
[sighs]

1:21:58.174 --> 1:22:01.481
[Dick] Seems like I missed
one hell of a ride, huh?

1:22:01.655 --> 1:22:04.528
Intelligence has confirmed
that that rat line
has been crippled. Well done.

1:22:04.702 --> 1:22:05.790
[all cheer]

1:22:05.964 --> 1:22:07.574
Now, we are all
still on standby,

1:22:07.748 --> 1:22:11.535
but everybody go
get yourselves cleaned up
for some chow.

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:14.973
[Tom] Well...
[clears throat]

1:22:15.147 --> 1:22:17.019
[Marty] Let'’s go, boys.
Let'’s get some food.Good job, Tom.

1:22:20.587 --> 1:22:21.937
Here'’s the mission report.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:23.939
Well done, Hudner.

1:22:25.592 --> 1:22:26.593
How you feeling?

1:22:27.768 --> 1:22:28.813
Good.

1:22:31.381 --> 1:22:32.425
Hmm.

1:22:33.122 --> 1:22:34.123
Sit down.

1:22:35.646 --> 1:22:36.647
[clears throat]

1:22:46.918 --> 1:22:47.832
Meh.

1:22:48.006 --> 1:22:49.007
[chuckles]

1:22:49.573 --> 1:22:50.574
That feeling?

1:22:51.705 --> 1:22:53.664
That'’s the mundanity
of a job well done.

1:22:58.147 --> 1:23:01.280
You know how many wars
there have been
in the history of mankind?

1:23:03.369 --> 1:23:04.631
No, course not.

1:23:04.805 --> 1:23:06.938
'’Cause most wars
are forgotten.

1:23:07.112 --> 1:23:08.418
All the men
who fought in '’em,

1:23:08.592 --> 1:23:11.421
and all the medals they won.

1:23:11.595 --> 1:23:13.945
Heroes and hardware
fade to the back
of the history books

1:23:14.119 --> 1:23:16.252
because it'’s not about war.

1:23:16.426 --> 1:23:19.429
This war never ends,
there'’s no V Day,
there'’s no finish line.

1:23:20.908 --> 1:23:23.041
The real battle
in all of life

1:23:23.215 --> 1:23:25.043
is being someone
that people can count on.

1:23:27.045 --> 1:23:29.047
And that isn'’t defined
in a single moment.

1:23:29.221 --> 1:23:31.702
You earn that with
a lifetime of showing up.

1:23:33.399 --> 1:23:36.881
These conflicts,
they don'’t define you, Tom.
You don'’t want '’em to.

1:23:37.055 --> 1:23:38.056
Trust me.

1:23:40.276 --> 1:23:42.060
-[lighter flicks]
-Go get something to eat.

1:23:43.496 --> 1:23:44.497
Go on.

1:23:50.808 --> 1:23:51.852
Hey, Tom.

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.030
What'’s the most
important thing?

1:23:56.727 --> 1:23:58.120
Bring '’em home.

1:23:58.642 --> 1:23:59.686
You did.

1:24:41.598 --> 1:24:43.817
[marine] Sir,
that is absolutely true.

1:24:43.991 --> 1:24:47.256
[marine 2] This is wisdom-seven.
Enemy troops estimate
company size and two tanks...

1:24:55.394 --> 1:24:59.224
[marine 3 on radio]
Personnel Tango-Romeo-
5-2-5-3-9-0.

1:25:05.187 --> 1:25:06.753
You know what else
I could use?

1:25:06.927 --> 1:25:08.451
[Peters] Warm blankets?

1:25:10.192 --> 1:25:11.193
Fire?

1:25:12.019 --> 1:25:13.238
The sun, maybe?

1:25:15.022 --> 1:25:16.372
Another shot
with Liz Taylor.

1:25:16.546 --> 1:25:19.244
Oh, Jesus! Buddy,
you gotta stop saying that.

1:25:19.418 --> 1:25:21.203
[scoffs]
You never had a shot with Liz.

1:25:21.377 --> 1:25:23.030
Uh, you weren'’t
paying attention.

1:25:23.814 --> 1:25:24.815
[sighs]

1:25:24.989 --> 1:25:26.295
I would take feeling
in my toes

1:25:26.469 --> 1:25:28.340
rather than a shot
with Liz right now.

1:25:28.514 --> 1:25:29.776
[laughs]

1:25:35.608 --> 1:25:37.219
You think
they'’ll hit us tonight?

1:25:39.351 --> 1:25:40.352
I would.

1:25:42.137 --> 1:25:44.095
You ever got anything nice
to say?

1:25:46.489 --> 1:25:48.882
[flare fires, hisses]

1:26:03.419 --> 1:26:05.116
[bullet buzzes][grunts]

1:26:05.290 --> 1:26:07.118
[Peters] Incoming![Buddy] Shit!

1:26:10.382 --> 1:26:11.688
Corpsman!

1:26:11.862 --> 1:26:13.037
[corpsman]
You'’re doing fine.
I got you.

1:26:13.907 --> 1:26:14.908
[marine] Downrange!

1:26:17.128 --> 1:26:18.999
Move left![marine 2] Fire at will!

1:26:19.174 --> 1:26:20.740
[marine] Move, move, move!

1:26:21.393 --> 1:26:22.568
Incoming!

1:26:33.536 --> 1:26:35.842
[gunshot echoes]

1:26:38.323 --> 1:26:39.324
What'’s going on?

1:26:58.474 --> 1:26:59.779
Looks like
the mission report said

1:26:59.953 --> 1:27:02.260
I ignored my commanding
officer'’s orders.

1:27:06.177 --> 1:27:07.874
Well, you know
how this stuff works.

1:27:08.048 --> 1:27:09.615
I only wrote down
what happened.

1:27:13.706 --> 1:27:15.969
I'’m glad that'’s
what you saw,
Lieutenant.

1:27:20.409 --> 1:27:21.671
It'’s what happened.

1:27:28.155 --> 1:27:30.854
Look, what difference
does it make?
We got the job done.

1:27:37.426 --> 1:27:38.905
Insubordination.

1:27:44.563 --> 1:27:46.652
That'’s what they'’re putting
in my Fitness Report.

1:27:53.877 --> 1:27:55.226
Uh, no, Cevoli'’s gotta
understand--

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:56.836
It'’s coming from
above Cevoli, Tom.

1:27:57.010 --> 1:27:58.316
Skipper'’s already read it.

1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:05.889
Jesse, I didn'’t
want that to happen.

1:28:06.063 --> 1:28:09.153
What did you want to happen,
Mr. Academy?

1:28:16.378 --> 1:28:17.466
Sorry, pal.

1:28:29.478 --> 1:28:31.871
You really hamstringed me
on this one.
[chuckles]

1:28:35.788 --> 1:28:38.008
I can'’t get promoted
with that on my report.

1:28:47.147 --> 1:28:49.324
You ever think
we'’d see a MiG?

1:28:49.498 --> 1:28:52.022
Hell, I thought
Goode was gonna bail out
all the way back to Brooklyn.

1:28:52.196 --> 1:28:54.546
You'’re the one
who shit his pants
when the MiG swooped in.

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:57.157
By the way,
you changed your diaper yet?Why don'’t you come check?

1:28:57.332 --> 1:28:59.725
Yeah, we'’re lucky
we made it out alive
the way you two shoot.

1:28:59.899 --> 1:29:00.900
How'’s that for aim?[laughs]

1:29:01.074 --> 1:29:02.337
[knock on door]

1:29:04.643 --> 1:29:05.992
I need your help
with something.

1:29:07.951 --> 1:29:09.431
[officer on PA]
All blue shirts on duty...

1:29:09.605 --> 1:29:11.520
[Jesse, muffled]
Boy, you stole it.

1:29:11.694 --> 1:29:13.652
That'’s a white man'’s uniform.

1:29:13.826 --> 1:29:16.394
[officer on PA]
All blue shirts on duty
report to Main Hangar 3.

1:29:16.568 --> 1:29:18.265
[Jesse] You shouldn'’t be
in that.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.441
Eh, boy?

1:29:21.312 --> 1:29:22.879
Think I'’ll make it out--

1:29:46.729 --> 1:29:49.122
Every hateful word
anyone'’s ever said to me.

1:29:53.388 --> 1:29:54.389
Wrote it down.

1:29:58.784 --> 1:30:00.046
Repeat it to myself.

1:30:05.312 --> 1:30:06.966
Been doing it
since I was a boy.

1:30:10.187 --> 1:30:11.231
It helps.

1:30:20.458 --> 1:30:21.720
What'’s that?

1:30:21.894 --> 1:30:23.722
Testimonies from the guys.

1:30:23.896 --> 1:30:27.117
Saying how the mission
was complicated,
and you did the right thing.

1:30:28.814 --> 1:30:30.903
It'’ll fix whatever remark
they put in your report.

1:30:39.042 --> 1:30:40.435
There'’s a--
There'’s a way things work

1:30:40.609 --> 1:30:42.088
you'’re not always
gonna understand.

1:30:44.395 --> 1:30:48.268
A slap on my wrist,
it'’s-- it'’s not the same
as a slap on yours.

1:30:49.531 --> 1:30:50.967
[sighs]

1:30:52.011 --> 1:30:53.012
This won'’t help.

1:30:59.323 --> 1:31:00.759
I'’m sticking
my neck out for you.

1:31:02.587 --> 1:31:04.197
Sticking your neck out?

1:31:05.198 --> 1:31:06.373
With a piece of paper?

1:31:08.201 --> 1:31:09.464
Tom...

1:31:11.814 --> 1:31:13.424
that paper cost you nothing.

1:31:14.817 --> 1:31:15.818
Nothing!

1:31:16.862 --> 1:31:18.734
You know how tired
I am of people

1:31:18.908 --> 1:31:21.737
trying to help me
while looking down on me?

1:31:25.218 --> 1:31:26.785
I'’m not looking down on you.

1:31:31.224 --> 1:31:32.574
What do you want me to do?

1:31:38.275 --> 1:31:41.191
Just be my wingman, pal.

1:31:44.063 --> 1:31:45.064
That'’s it.

1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:50.940
Forget the life saver,
and get in the damn water!

1:31:51.114 --> 1:31:52.463
Please, Tom!

1:32:23.363 --> 1:32:24.756
Ensign Brown?

1:32:26.932 --> 1:32:29.805
We were waiting for you
back in the wardroom,
but you never showed.

1:32:32.590 --> 1:32:33.939
Needed some time alone.

1:32:39.249 --> 1:32:41.207
Bunch of us brothers
across the ship been talking.

1:32:42.774 --> 1:32:44.733
Heard you had some
real good shooting yesterday,

1:32:44.907 --> 1:32:47.039
and we just wanna
let you know we see you.

1:32:51.435 --> 1:32:54.960
[sailor 1]
Yeah, my rack man knows
how to fix it. I'’ll get him.

1:32:55.134 --> 1:32:58.485
[sailor 2] On it. Now get these
back on the cleats, too.

1:33:01.793 --> 1:33:03.621
[sailor 3]
Tab it, mark it off.

1:33:14.066 --> 1:33:16.591
Bunch of us chipped in
back in Cannes.

1:33:25.425 --> 1:33:26.862
What'’s your name, sailor?

1:33:27.689 --> 1:33:28.646
Fambrough.

1:33:29.473 --> 1:33:32.041
Archie Fambrough, sir.

1:33:34.304 --> 1:33:35.653
Jesse.

1:33:49.928 --> 1:33:51.103
Archie.

1:33:55.325 --> 1:33:56.848
Tell the brothers
I appreciate it.

1:34:06.553 --> 1:34:10.601
[helicopter whirring]

1:34:13.517 --> 1:34:16.476
[sailor] Roger that!
Let'’s mount it to the deck!
We should be good.

1:34:16.651 --> 1:34:18.130
[corpsman]
All right, let'’s go.

1:34:19.349 --> 1:34:21.090
[corpsman 2]
That'’s it, easy. Easy!

1:34:21.264 --> 1:34:22.787
Be gentle now.
All right, let'’s go,
let'’s go, come on!

1:34:22.961 --> 1:34:24.963
-We got you.
-[corpsman 3] He'’s packaged.

1:34:25.137 --> 1:34:26.312
Gonna be okay.

1:34:26.486 --> 1:34:28.575
Move! Doc'’s
waiting downstairs.

1:34:30.447 --> 1:34:31.491
We got you, bud.

1:34:34.886 --> 1:34:37.541
[sailor 1] Aye, aye, sir,
they'’re up and running.

1:34:37.715 --> 1:34:40.065
[sailor 2] Hey, double time it
back to your station.

1:34:40.805 --> 1:34:42.154
[pilot] Mississippi Brown?

1:34:43.286 --> 1:34:44.896
Charlie Ward.

1:34:45.070 --> 1:34:46.376
We went to
flight school together.

1:34:46.550 --> 1:34:48.508
Alabama Ward?The very one.

1:34:49.684 --> 1:34:51.729
You flying eggbeaters now?

1:34:51.903 --> 1:34:53.862
The Navy must'’ve heard
I was looking for something
stupid and dangerous.

1:34:54.036 --> 1:34:56.560
Besides, I wouldn'’t
feel right sharing
the fixed-wing skies

1:34:56.734 --> 1:34:58.127
with a Southern legend.

1:34:59.302 --> 1:35:00.433
Always knew you'’d make it,

1:35:00.607 --> 1:35:02.522
but it is damn good
to see you, Jesse.

1:35:02.697 --> 1:35:05.525
Although, I wish it were
under better circumstances.

1:35:10.530 --> 1:35:11.531
Good to see you, pal.

1:35:13.403 --> 1:35:15.100
Take care of yourself,
Mississippi.

1:35:19.844 --> 1:35:20.845
'’Bama!

1:35:23.282 --> 1:35:24.283
I married her.

1:35:25.197 --> 1:35:26.198
[claps]

1:35:30.115 --> 1:35:31.726
Oh, we home, baby.

1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:35.120
You wanna get down?[grunts]

1:35:35.294 --> 1:35:36.339
Okay.

1:35:41.736 --> 1:35:42.737
[sighs]

1:35:44.695 --> 1:35:45.740
Jesse.

1:35:55.445 --> 1:35:57.795
[Jesse]
My dear, sweet angel,

1:35:57.969 --> 1:35:59.536
I hope this letter
reaches you in time,

1:35:59.710 --> 1:36:01.451
because I wanted
to be the first

1:36:01.625 --> 1:36:04.019
to wish you
a very happy birthday.

1:36:04.193 --> 1:36:06.499
I know it'’s hard to plan
a party from across the world,

1:36:06.673 --> 1:36:10.025
but I thought of something fun
we might be
able to do together.

1:36:10.199 --> 1:36:11.461
Grab Pam.

1:36:11.635 --> 1:36:12.810
Got something for her, too.

1:36:12.984 --> 1:36:13.985
[chuckles]

1:36:18.207 --> 1:36:19.643
"Oh, it'’s dark
and it'’s cramped

1:36:19.817 --> 1:36:21.906
in this spot we'’ve all been.

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:25.954
It'’s a place for a chick,
but not a mean, old hen."

1:36:48.672 --> 1:36:51.588
"It'’s dark and it'’s cramped,
in this spot we'’ve all been."

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:12.304
Daddy got us a gift.Oh.
[mumbles]

1:37:12.478 --> 1:37:13.523
Yeah.

1:37:15.264 --> 1:37:16.265
[gasps]

1:37:17.875 --> 1:37:19.181
Miss Pam, look.

1:37:19.355 --> 1:37:20.399
[gasps]

1:37:32.324 --> 1:37:36.459
[Jesse] Darling,
hope you found a little box
in Pam'’s closet.

1:37:38.026 --> 1:37:39.723
I'’m going to close now.

1:37:39.897 --> 1:37:41.681
I'’ll write to you
as soon I can.

1:37:42.595 --> 1:37:43.988
Your devoted husband.

1:37:45.468 --> 1:37:48.688
Lovingly and completely yours.

1:37:50.342 --> 1:37:51.474
I'’ll love you forever.

1:37:52.823 --> 1:37:53.868
Jesse.

1:38:05.183 --> 1:38:08.143
Just talked to some of
those injured soldiers
that are arriving.

1:38:09.796 --> 1:38:10.841
[scoffs]

1:38:13.626 --> 1:38:15.498
They'’re from
the 1st Marine Division.

1:38:15.672 --> 1:38:18.109
[Marty] Same ones
who hitched a ride with us
from Quonset.

1:38:19.894 --> 1:38:21.547
They'’re pinned down
at Hagaru Base.

1:38:23.245 --> 1:38:25.682
They'’re saying that
it'’s an unspeakable hell.

1:38:27.902 --> 1:38:29.120
For every one marine,

1:38:29.294 --> 1:38:31.731
there are six Chinese
hiding in the woods.

1:38:31.906 --> 1:38:33.908
Gets below minus 30 at night.

1:38:37.302 --> 1:38:39.609
Those boys are holding on
by their fingernails.

1:38:42.307 --> 1:38:44.831
Some air support would be
mighty welcome. Hmm?

1:38:46.921 --> 1:38:49.749
Punch a hole in that wall.
Take away the Chinese
numerical advantage.

1:38:49.924 --> 1:38:52.491
Give our guys a chance
to get back up on their feet.

1:38:57.844 --> 1:38:59.672
This is a dangerous mission.

1:39:01.457 --> 1:39:03.763
It is dangerous
in a different way
than Sinuiju, okay?

1:39:03.938 --> 1:39:05.765
This is not about
bridges and rat lines.

1:39:05.940 --> 1:39:09.030
This is about thousands
of Chinese soldiers
hiding in the woods

1:39:09.204 --> 1:39:11.989
and shooting at you
from 20 feet below.

1:39:14.035 --> 1:39:15.732
This is extremely
hazardous duty.

1:39:15.906 --> 1:39:17.299
I am not gonna sugarcoat it.

1:39:18.039 --> 1:39:19.866
Men need help,

1:39:20.041 --> 1:39:21.999
and they need what
only we can give '’em.

1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.480
So, I'’m gonna take you there.

1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:26.612
We'’re gonna give '’em hell.

1:39:26.786 --> 1:39:28.614
We'’re gonna get
those marines back.

1:39:28.788 --> 1:39:30.486
[pilot] Yes, sir.
Let'’s get outta here.

1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:32.575
[plane roaring][marine] Two o'’clock!
Comin'’ at ya!

1:39:32.749 --> 1:39:34.403
[marine 1] I can'’t see it.
[marine 2] I got him!

1:39:34.577 --> 1:39:36.144
I got him!

1:39:43.064 --> 1:39:44.369
[artillery approaching]

1:39:44.543 --> 1:39:45.588
[grunts]

1:39:46.893 --> 1:39:47.851
[groans]

1:39:48.025 --> 1:39:49.157
[groans]

1:39:49.896 --> 1:39:51.246
Buddy, hey!

1:39:53.335 --> 1:39:54.466
You'’re good, you'’re good.

1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:56.120
Come on, come on.
You'’re good. Go!

1:39:56.294 --> 1:39:57.426
You'’re good. Go!

1:40:00.298 --> 1:40:01.256
[screams]

1:40:02.039 --> 1:40:04.694
[soldiers shouting]

1:40:07.088 --> 1:40:09.394
[groans]

1:40:09.568 --> 1:40:10.874
[marine] Right side!
Two o'’clock!

1:40:11.657 --> 1:40:12.658
[marine 2] Bring it out!

1:40:15.052 --> 1:40:16.488
You know any good prayers?

1:40:16.662 --> 1:40:18.447
Come on, we'’ve seen
worse than this!

1:40:18.621 --> 1:40:21.406
If you want a prayer,
"Dear God, send us
some angels."

1:40:36.030 --> 1:40:38.032
[marine 1] There!
The tree line! Light '’em up!

1:40:42.514 --> 1:40:44.864
Fire '’em up![marine 2] Yeah,
get '’em, boys!

1:40:59.531 --> 1:41:00.793
[marines] Yeah!

1:41:13.545 --> 1:41:15.286
[marine 3] Move! Move! Move!Come on!

1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:17.332
Can'’t let the flyboys
take all the credit!

1:41:17.506 --> 1:41:19.464
[shouting]

1:41:19.638 --> 1:41:21.466
[panting]

1:41:24.904 --> 1:41:27.472
[marine 4] Get down,
get down! Let'’s go!
Let'’s go! Let'’s go!

1:41:27.646 --> 1:41:28.908
[grunting]

1:41:40.746 --> 1:41:42.966
[shouting]

1:41:49.755 --> 1:41:51.017
[marine 5] Yeah!

1:41:52.454 --> 1:41:54.543
You see that?
We got a Negro pilot!

1:41:55.413 --> 1:41:57.459
[Peters] Let'’s go![grunts]

1:42:07.469 --> 1:42:09.340
[Dick on radio]
Looks like we got
the Chinese running,

1:42:09.514 --> 1:42:10.689
but let'’s get
a closer look, boys.

1:42:10.863 --> 1:42:12.300
Rendezvous on me.

1:42:15.955 --> 1:42:18.262
[shouting in Mandarin]

1:42:23.180 --> 1:42:25.617
211, you got a streamer.
I think you'’re losing fuel.

1:42:34.322 --> 1:42:35.279
It'’s not fuel.

1:42:35.453 --> 1:42:36.976
She'’s bleeding oil.

1:42:41.807 --> 1:42:43.244
[engine sputtering]

1:42:48.597 --> 1:42:50.686
She'’s not staying up
in the air much longer.

1:42:53.515 --> 1:42:56.082
Let'’s climb.
Find a place
to put her down.

1:43:09.531 --> 1:43:11.315
[Tom] Take her down
nice and easy, Jesse.

1:43:20.977 --> 1:43:21.978
Jesse, at your 10:00.

1:43:24.372 --> 1:43:25.895
It could work.

1:43:26.765 --> 1:43:27.810
Eyes on it.

1:43:38.255 --> 1:43:40.344
Flight lead,
I'’m following him down.

1:43:40.518 --> 1:43:42.433
Copy that.
We'’ll keep an eye on you.

1:43:42.607 --> 1:43:44.043
Switching radio to
search and rescue.

1:43:50.049 --> 1:43:51.094
Checklist?

1:43:52.051 --> 1:43:53.096
Go ahead.

1:43:54.097 --> 1:43:55.359
[breathing heavily]
Salvo rockets.

1:44:09.417 --> 1:44:10.679
Release drop tanks.

1:44:20.558 --> 1:44:22.473
Canopy back and locked.

1:44:23.909 --> 1:44:26.042
[breathing heavily][wind whistling]

1:44:32.048 --> 1:44:34.093
[grunting]

1:44:34.268 --> 1:44:35.269
Deadstick.

1:44:35.921 --> 1:44:37.096
Deadstick.

1:44:38.228 --> 1:44:39.403
I'’m not gonna make
the clearing.

1:44:39.577 --> 1:44:42.145
[Tom] Yes, you are.
Flaps down.

1:44:42.319 --> 1:44:44.539
[breathing heavily]

1:44:55.985 --> 1:44:57.378
You'’re at 200 feet.

1:45:03.122 --> 1:45:04.515
She won'’t go any slower.

1:45:07.431 --> 1:45:08.911
I can'’t stick with you.

1:45:09.955 --> 1:45:11.653
That'’s the whole
nine yards, Tom.

1:45:31.716 --> 1:45:33.849
[breathing heavily]

1:45:35.198 --> 1:45:36.242
[grunts]

1:45:45.077 --> 1:45:46.862
[breathing heavily]

1:45:50.779 --> 1:45:54.173
Come on! Come on.
[grunts] Come on!

1:46:01.572 --> 1:46:02.660
[shouts]

1:46:07.404 --> 1:46:09.363
211, come in.

1:46:11.365 --> 1:46:12.975
211, come in.

1:46:17.022 --> 1:46:19.547
Tom, once Jesse gets cleared,
you scuttle that plane.

1:46:19.721 --> 1:46:21.853
We can'’t have the Corsair
falling into enemy hands.

1:46:24.116 --> 1:46:25.422
[breathing heavily]

1:46:25.596 --> 1:46:26.771
He'’s not moving.

1:46:28.338 --> 1:46:30.819
Come on, Jesse. Come on.

1:46:34.997 --> 1:46:36.868
Come on, Jesse. Come on.

1:46:48.489 --> 1:46:50.012
[sighs]

1:46:51.230 --> 1:46:52.362
What'’s he doing?

1:46:52.536 --> 1:46:54.190
Why isn'’t he getting out?

1:46:54.364 --> 1:46:57.019
If we can see the smoke,
the Chinese can, too.

1:46:59.064 --> 1:47:00.239
He should'’ve been out by now.

1:47:01.153 --> 1:47:02.633
[Tom] He'’s stuck in there.

1:47:02.807 --> 1:47:05.114
That fire is gonna
eat him alive.

1:47:05.288 --> 1:47:07.377
Come on, Jesse.
Get out of there.

1:47:12.469 --> 1:47:14.340
[breathing heavily]

1:47:24.916 --> 1:47:26.440
I'’m gonna go get Jesse.

1:47:26.614 --> 1:47:28.093
[Bill] Tom, you'’re gonna
get yourself killed.

1:47:28.267 --> 1:47:29.443
[Dick] Don'’t crash
your own plane.

1:47:29.617 --> 1:47:30.966
The hell are you doing,
Hudner?

1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:32.924
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Iroquois, 201.

1:47:33.098 --> 1:47:36.275
RDF call. I have one,
soon-to-be two pilots down.

1:47:36.450 --> 1:47:37.799
Request immediate assistance.

1:47:37.973 --> 1:47:39.844
[Leyte CIC] 201,
you are in hostile airspace.

1:47:40.018 --> 1:47:42.368
Search and rescue is still
estimating 30 minutes out.

1:47:42.543 --> 1:47:43.457
Return to ship.

1:47:43.631 --> 1:47:46.198
[breathing heavily]

1:47:46.372 --> 1:47:48.940
Tom, search and rescue
is 30 minutes out,

1:47:49.114 --> 1:47:50.725
but help is on the way.

1:47:52.553 --> 1:47:53.554
Be careful down there.

1:47:55.207 --> 1:47:56.339
Yes, sir.

1:47:59.298 --> 1:48:00.778
[exhaling]

1:48:50.785 --> 1:48:52.438

1:49:31.173 --> 1:49:33.262
[panting][gunfire in distance]

1:49:59.549 --> 1:50:02.073
You just ruined
a perfectly good
Corsair, Lieutenant.

1:50:04.467 --> 1:50:06.687
I think that'’s going
in the mission report.

1:50:06.861 --> 1:50:08.689
[chuckles]

1:50:08.863 --> 1:50:10.386
That'’s a negative.
We can'’t send an Angel.

1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:11.866
Our choppers
can'’t fly in the dark.

1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:13.258
It'’s way too dangerous.

1:50:15.478 --> 1:50:16.697
Who'’d they say is down?

1:50:16.871 --> 1:50:18.220
[dispatch officer]
Two Corsairs from VF-32.

1:50:18.394 --> 1:50:20.004
Lieutenant Hudner
and an Ensign Brown.

1:50:20.178 --> 1:50:22.485
[radio chatter]

1:50:22.659 --> 1:50:24.052
Tell '’em I'’m coming.

1:50:24.226 --> 1:50:25.923
[both grunting]

1:50:28.665 --> 1:50:30.101
Stuck in good, Tom.

1:50:33.191 --> 1:50:34.715
I'’m gonna put out this fire.

1:50:34.889 --> 1:50:36.368
We'’ll get you
out of here, okay?

1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:52.907
[grunting]

1:50:54.604 --> 1:50:55.779
[groans]

1:51:06.747 --> 1:51:08.226
Should we get you
out of here?

1:51:09.706 --> 1:51:10.794
Can we push?

1:51:19.237 --> 1:51:20.282
One.

1:51:21.370 --> 1:51:22.458
Two.

1:51:22.632 --> 1:51:23.807
Three.

1:51:25.853 --> 1:51:27.768
[metal creaking][Jesse grunts]

1:51:29.857 --> 1:51:31.685
[both grunting]

1:51:34.078 --> 1:51:36.167
[panting]

1:51:36.341 --> 1:51:38.517
[breathing heavily]

1:51:49.398 --> 1:51:50.486
Up and hard on my call.

1:52:05.109 --> 1:52:06.458
[Jesse grunts]

1:52:06.632 --> 1:52:08.852
[metal creaking]

1:52:11.333 --> 1:52:14.118
[screaming]

1:52:17.992 --> 1:52:19.689
[breathing heavily]

1:53:03.428 --> 1:53:05.256
[explosions,
gunfire in distance]

1:53:07.824 --> 1:53:09.957
[helicopter approaching]

1:53:23.622 --> 1:53:24.798
Jesse, you hear that?

1:53:26.669 --> 1:53:28.453
[breathing heavily]

1:53:30.629 --> 1:53:31.848
They'’re coming for us.

1:53:52.826 --> 1:53:54.436
[gasping]

1:54:02.444 --> 1:54:04.838
[Tom] He'’s pinned inside.[Charlie] Take the axe.

1:54:05.012 --> 1:54:08.015
We got enemy
not far away.
We gotta work fast!

1:54:13.890 --> 1:54:16.023
[grunting]

1:54:20.984 --> 1:54:22.551
[Jesse] Tom.[grunts]

1:54:23.595 --> 1:54:24.770
Tom!

1:54:32.909 --> 1:54:34.041
Just...

1:54:35.956 --> 1:54:37.479
tell Daisy...

1:54:40.917 --> 1:54:42.876
how much I love her.

1:54:45.487 --> 1:54:46.923
We'’re getting you out of here.

1:54:48.882 --> 1:54:49.883
[exhales]

1:54:50.057 --> 1:54:51.275
[grunting]

1:54:55.845 --> 1:54:56.890
Hudner!

1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:58.892
[muffled] Hudner!

1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:05.333
[shouts] Hudner!

1:55:05.507 --> 1:55:07.639
[panting]

1:55:25.396 --> 1:55:26.920
[sniffles]

1:55:36.712 --> 1:55:38.105
We have to leave now.

1:55:38.279 --> 1:55:39.454
[exhales]

1:55:46.156 --> 1:55:47.766
I'’ll come back for you.

1:56:46.825 --> 1:56:49.002
Tom, keep warm,
all right?

1:56:49.176 --> 1:56:50.264
Coffee down there.

1:56:50.438 --> 1:56:52.092
We'’ll get you
out of here soon.

1:56:58.576 --> 1:57:00.709
[chattering]

1:58:41.984 --> 1:58:43.290
We can'’t get Jesse.

1:58:47.032 --> 1:58:48.556
The area is
totally overrun.

1:58:48.730 --> 1:58:50.514
Search and rescue
is too dangerous.

1:58:52.429 --> 1:58:54.910
Skipper has asked us
to scuttle both planes.

1:58:59.088 --> 1:59:02.047
Hudner,
Doc has grounded you.

1:59:08.141 --> 1:59:09.664
This is
a funeral flight, men.

1:59:12.667 --> 1:59:14.712
This is your only chance
to say goodbye.

1:59:22.851 --> 1:59:24.069
Wheels up in 15.

2:00:20.430 --> 2:00:21.518
Oh, Tom...

2:00:22.693 --> 2:00:23.999
I know.[sniffles]

2:00:54.725 --> 2:00:57.119
Yesterday, we lost
a great aviator.

2:00:58.076 --> 2:00:59.426
Ensign Jesse Brown.

2:01:01.645 --> 2:01:03.647
His loss is felt
all across this ship,

2:01:05.649 --> 2:01:08.130
and will certainly be felt
all across our nation.

2:01:10.915 --> 2:01:12.700
Our country needed
Jesse Brown.

2:01:25.408 --> 2:01:26.975
...Jesse.Don'’t worry about that.

2:01:27.149 --> 2:01:28.542
[giggling, gasps]

2:02:17.895 --> 2:02:19.984
[crying]

2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:24.875
[passenger]
Thank you, ma'’am.

2:03:27.661 --> 2:03:30.707
Mrs. Brown.
I'’m Seaman First Class
Clara Carrol.

2:03:30.881 --> 2:03:32.317
It'’s a pleasure
meeting you.

2:03:33.231 --> 2:03:34.407
Come right this way.

2:04:26.067 --> 2:04:28.156
[chattering]

2:04:30.985 --> 2:04:32.116
Excuse me.

2:04:50.657 --> 2:04:51.745
Daisy.

2:04:58.012 --> 2:04:59.492
These are yours.

2:05:14.942 --> 2:05:17.901
I can imagine
this is a lot.

2:05:18.075 --> 2:05:20.034
I can'’t imagine
how you must--I'’m okay.

2:05:21.992 --> 2:05:23.211
But thank you.

2:05:28.303 --> 2:05:29.522
[sighs]

2:05:31.306 --> 2:05:33.177
I was afraid of
coming here today.

2:05:34.614 --> 2:05:36.441
More afraid than
I'’ve been in my life.

2:05:38.095 --> 2:05:40.750
To face you knowing I--Tom, I appreciate
what you did.

2:05:43.448 --> 2:05:44.580
And I hope you know that.

2:06:01.945 --> 2:06:03.947
I was with Jesse
before he died.

2:06:06.907 --> 2:06:09.692
He was calm
throughout it all.

2:06:11.868 --> 2:06:13.435
I was with him
to the very end.

2:06:17.570 --> 2:06:19.615
The last words
out of his mouth
were for you.

2:06:21.443 --> 2:06:22.749
He said,

2:06:23.750 --> 2:06:25.795
"Just tell Daisy how
much I love her."

2:06:30.234 --> 2:06:31.758
[sighs]

2:06:35.979 --> 2:06:37.807
I'’m sorry
I couldn'’t save him.

2:06:42.029 --> 2:06:43.770
Tom,
that was never your job.

2:06:45.859 --> 2:06:47.991
Never anyone'’s job
to save Jesse.

2:06:51.081 --> 2:06:52.692
I asked you
to be there for him.

2:06:54.781 --> 2:06:56.130
And you were.

2:07:25.899 --> 2:07:28.945
[Jesse] I'’m going to close now
and climb into the rack.

2:07:30.294 --> 2:07:33.384
I honestly dread going to bed,
but I usually dream of you,

2:07:33.558 --> 2:07:37.301
so I'’ll manage to make it
until we'’ll share our bed
together again.

2:07:40.130 --> 2:07:41.262
Darling,

2:07:42.742 --> 2:07:44.178
pray that it'’ll be soon.

2:07:45.483 --> 2:07:46.659
I have to fly tomorrow...

2:07:48.661 --> 2:07:50.488
but so far as that goes,

2:07:50.663 --> 2:07:52.142
my heart hasn'’t been
to the earth

2:07:52.316 --> 2:07:54.449
since the first time
you kissed me.

2:07:56.494 --> 2:07:57.887
And when you love me,

2:07:58.061 --> 2:08:02.326
you send it clear
out of this world.

2:08:09.507 --> 2:08:11.292
I'’ll write you
as soon as I can.

2:08:13.076 --> 2:08:14.077
I love you forever.

2:08:23.086 --> 2:08:24.348
Your devoted husband,

2:08:26.133 --> 2:08:28.613
lovingly
and completely yours.

2:08:31.355 --> 2:08:32.530
Forever.

2:08:35.925 --> 2:08:37.100
Jesse.
