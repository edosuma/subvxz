00:06.027 --> 00:09.329
- Happy New Year, Dad.
- Happy New Year, Albert. Take this.

00:09.354 --> 00:12.062
Albert needs to understand,
if he's gonna play the game,

00:12.104 --> 00:13.270
he needs to go in heavy.

00:13.354 --> 00:15.186
You keep your beak out of it, Vic Hill.

00:15.187 --> 00:17.395
Come on, Charlie, you know
we need as much cash as we can

00:17.479 --> 00:18.520
to bet on Billy's fight tonight.

00:18.562 --> 00:21.187
I have a very rare fob watch.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.019
I'd like an appraisal for a sale.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.645
Sonny's got a collection
going out this morning.

00:25.687 --> 00:27.519
- I give you the route.
- Two trucks?

00:27.520 --> 00:30.753
You figure out the best
place to hit the truck.

00:31.145 --> 00:33.204
- We've rung the bell.
- Hell, yeah.

00:33.229 --> 00:34.937
That's gangsta!

00:48.520 --> 00:50.129
Time to hustle, Vic.

00:50.161 --> 00:51.593
We'll come back tomorrow
and fill our boots.

00:53.187 --> 00:57.229
One for me, one for the
wife, one for Albert,

00:57.312 --> 00:58.932
and one for luck.

01:12.187 --> 01:13.937
Put it away. No.

01:13.979 --> 01:17.604
Let's see who it is and
have a nice, quiet word.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.312
Get down!

01:26.354 --> 01:27.770
Aah!

01:27.812 --> 01:29.395
- Freeze!
- Stay down!

01:49.669 --> 01:50.687
Bob?

01:52.556 --> 01:53.888
Don't shoot!

01:53.913 --> 01:55.496
You dirty son of a bitch!

01:57.354 --> 01:59.041
Your double-crossed me, Fink!

addic7ed

02:43.770 --> 02:45.520
So, you're telling me
there was two trucks?

02:45.562 --> 02:47.937
Yeah, two exactly the same trucks,
passing me at exactly the same time.

02:47.979 --> 02:49.479
So, uh, which one did
you choose, Charlie?

02:49.520 --> 02:50.832
The one that looked
just like the other one.

02:50.857 --> 02:51.899
Oh, fair play.

02:51.924 --> 02:53.520
Sonny wasn't shipping gold.

02:53.562 --> 02:54.895
So you have no idea whose gold this is?

02:54.937 --> 02:57.437
Yeah... yeah we do.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.186
It's ours!

02:59.187 --> 03:00.519
And this mountain of auriferous

03:00.520 --> 03:02.812
has gotta be worth bloody millions.

03:02.854 --> 03:05.186
It's official... we can retire.

03:05.187 --> 03:06.812
Can't retire if you've
never worked, knob head.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.979
Yeah, of course you can.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.354
My father hasn't worked
a day in his life.

03:09.395 --> 03:10.854
Beginning to think I
hadn't been so blessed.

03:10.937 --> 03:12.019
Thank you, God!

03:12.020 --> 03:14.187
- Nobody's retirin'.
- Oh, here we go.

03:14.270 --> 03:16.145
We have stumbled across
a fortune in gold bullion

03:16.187 --> 03:19.020
with no clue what dangerous
bastard it belongs to.

03:19.062 --> 03:20.979
We have zero experience
in trading precious metals,

03:21.020 --> 03:22.104
and if we start making inquiries

03:22.145 --> 03:23.479
to the wrong fence, we'll come unstuck

03:23.506 --> 03:26.131
quicker than shit moves through a goose.

03:26.187 --> 03:27.645
No. We stash all of it,

03:27.687 --> 03:29.854
all of it until we know who
and what we're dealing with.

03:29.895 --> 03:31.562
Then what? Suppose you got a spare safe

03:31.604 --> 03:33.256
knockin' around here?

03:34.020 --> 03:35.395
Shut up.

03:45.354 --> 03:48.187
There are some advantages to
being the son of a bank robber.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.354
Good boy, Smudger, just
stick 'em on the shelf.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.187
Oi. Be careful, sloppy bollocks.

04:03.229 --> 04:04.812
Shit. Sorry.

04:07.562 --> 04:09.145
What are you doin'?

04:09.187 --> 04:11.937
Watchin' them young tarts and
old farts, skinny little pedo?

04:11.979 --> 04:15.062
Some kids posted a
video clip on Instagram.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.853
It's a... security
truck gettin' boosted.

04:19.228 --> 04:20.687
Give us that here.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.520
It's impossible to make a
dishonest livin' these days

04:22.562 --> 04:24.937
without gettin' a camera
shoved in your face.

04:25.020 --> 04:28.020
These mobile devices have spawned

04:28.062 --> 04:30.853
a generation of grasses.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.020
Hey, Vic, you should
take a look at this, mate.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.979
It's a bullion heist.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.645
- Bullion?
- Yeah.

04:37.687 --> 04:39.270
Here you are. Take a look.

04:43.729 --> 04:44.979
Hmm...

05:01.687 --> 05:05.729
Ah. I mean, talk about
a two-pronged attack, eh?

05:05.770 --> 05:08.854
Boom! Opened up that
van like a can of beans.

05:08.895 --> 05:10.312
This giving you a stiffy, Peters?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.354
Speaking' of pricks...

05:13.395 --> 05:15.853
- You seen it, then?
- Yeah, it's called "viral," Bob.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.604
You goin' after it?

05:19.645 --> 05:22.145
Uh, Bob, you're CTF.

05:22.187 --> 05:25.479
Isn't there a shipment of BB guns
that need confiscatin' somewhere?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.520
Listen... Teri.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.270
I know about gold heists.
I did a bit of work

05:32.312 --> 05:36.187
with Flying Squad, I
mean, I... I can help.

05:36.229 --> 05:39.208
Yeah. All right, then, Bob.

05:39.233 --> 05:42.121
I'll have an Americano
and an almond croissant.

05:45.859 --> 05:46.958
Right.

05:46.983 --> 05:49.186
I think we should move a couple of
ingots for a bit of running about money.

05:49.187 --> 05:51.173
Yeah. We're all a
little bit short, right?

05:51.198 --> 05:53.312
No. Not one single ingot. Right?
No one talks about the gold,

05:53.354 --> 05:54.895
nobody knows about the gold,

05:54.979 --> 05:56.519
nobody even thinks about the gold.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.937
The gold doesn't exist, are we clear?

05:57.979 --> 05:59.979
God, you're such a pill sometimes, Al.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.784
_

06:04.354 --> 06:05.687
It's Lotti Mott.

06:05.729 --> 06:07.062
- Shit.
- Shit.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.581
_

06:13.381 --> 06:14.561
_

06:14.611 --> 06:17.391
_

06:22.354 --> 06:24.395
Keep your business off text!

06:24.437 --> 06:25.770
We need to talk.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.687
Hello, Sidney?

06:40.854 --> 06:42.604
Mr. Gold?

06:44.354 --> 06:46.354
Sidney, don't get emotional.

06:46.437 --> 06:49.520
Thanks to all this, I've gotta
find someone else for the job today.

06:49.562 --> 06:51.145
Stop, please.

06:51.187 --> 06:54.812
I've always got top
results. Whatever it takes...

06:54.854 --> 06:58.312
I have no complaints
regarding your skills.

06:58.354 --> 07:01.087
In fact, our mutual friend
there is something of a legend,

07:01.112 --> 07:04.277
and that's a compliment to you, Sidney.

07:04.278 --> 07:06.153
Cost me a pretty penny, I'll tell ya.

07:06.195 --> 07:08.445
Goes by the name of...

07:09.778 --> 07:11.653
Windrush.

07:11.695 --> 07:14.570
He's the best hired hand money can buy.

07:14.612 --> 07:17.278
No... no... please, Mr. Gold!

07:17.320 --> 07:22.195
Alas, Sidney, you're
something of a schmuck.

07:22.237 --> 07:26.445
Now I know this because having
decided that no one's gonna notice

07:26.521 --> 07:30.313
if you steal one of my
paintings from the Venice job...

07:30.362 --> 07:33.445
- Saul, please...
- ...you go and pinch the middle section

07:33.487 --> 07:35.945
of the Whore of Babylon triptych!

07:39.112 --> 07:40.695
Please, Mr. Gold!

07:54.028 --> 07:56.444
Saul Gold and Associates.

07:56.445 --> 07:58.987
Saul. Vic Hill.

07:59.070 --> 08:00.778
Vic?

08:00.796 --> 08:02.920
How's Her Majesty treatin' you, then?

08:02.945 --> 08:06.778
Well, I can't grumble, Saul,
and if I did, who'd listen?

08:06.862 --> 08:09.528
So, what can I do you for?

08:09.570 --> 08:12.362
You hear anythin' about the
bullion heist last night?

08:12.403 --> 08:13.903
Forklifts and piggys.

08:13.945 --> 08:16.278
- I seen the video.
- It's tidy work.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.403
Actually reminded me the sort
of work you might've done.

08:18.445 --> 08:21.112
- Anybody ringin' your bell?
- Tryin' to move the consignment?

08:21.153 --> 08:23.362
Not a peep.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.487
Why the inquiry?

08:24.528 --> 08:27.112
Well, I'm just sniffin' about.

08:27.153 --> 08:29.777
It gets a bit stale in here, Saul.

08:29.778 --> 08:33.028
Imagination runs wild.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.092
Well, if you're looking for action,

08:34.116 --> 08:35.611
I might have something to put your way.

08:35.653 --> 08:38.903
I need a couple of cool heads
for a job this afternoon.

08:38.945 --> 08:41.125
Low risk, going rates.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.445
Got a face that fits?

08:43.486 --> 08:45.237
Ah...

08:45.284 --> 08:49.034
We took a vote. Decided
to pass on your offer.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.731
Yeah, haven't quite reached
the armed robbery phase

08:51.756 --> 08:53.570
in our projected careers.

08:53.612 --> 08:55.903
We didn't hit your boyfriend's truck.

08:55.945 --> 08:57.612
I know you didn't.

08:57.653 --> 08:59.070
So what's with the sit down?

09:00.487 --> 09:02.612
Right place. Right time.

09:04.653 --> 09:06.028
Wrong truck.

09:10.778 --> 09:14.153
Credit where it's due,
you boys are gangsta.

09:15.778 --> 09:19.611
Take another vote,
and then come find me.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.945
Thirty thousand views! This
thing's breaking the Internet!

09:30.570 --> 09:31.778
We're gonna get shot.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.945
Right. I'm gettin' tooled up!

09:34.987 --> 09:37.237
Wait, calm down! Sit down!

09:37.278 --> 09:39.112
Sit down. Sit down.

09:39.153 --> 09:41.028
We're rockin' masks and boiler suits.

09:41.070 --> 09:42.737
No one can know it's us, can they?

09:42.778 --> 09:44.070
No.

09:45.071 --> 09:46.195
But what about Lotti Mott?

09:47.362 --> 09:48.362
Huh?

09:48.745 --> 09:49.832
_

09:53.820 --> 09:55.195
Listen, I don't know about her.

09:55.278 --> 09:57.528
Do I? I've gotta think about it.

09:57.612 --> 09:59.778
You keep your eye on her, Bill.

09:59.806 --> 10:01.683
I can do that.

10:01.708 --> 10:02.778
- Albert?
- Yeah?

10:02.820 --> 10:04.944
Vic's on the blower.

10:04.945 --> 10:07.070
Well, that is all I need, isn't it?

10:09.112 --> 10:11.444
We did all right last
night, didn't we, boy?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.862
- Last night?
- The fight, Al.

10:13.903 --> 10:15.444
You got somethin' else
in the hopper, son?

10:15.445 --> 10:17.278
Oh, no, you're right, sorry,
I've... I've had a couple

10:17.320 --> 10:20.237
- and I'm celebratin'.
- Have a tall one for me.

10:20.262 --> 10:21.362
So what's goin' on?

10:21.403 --> 10:23.737
- Saul Gold is goin' on.
- Saul Gold the fence?

10:23.778 --> 10:24.778
He's called a job on.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.195
Pick up and drop this afternoon.

10:26.237 --> 10:29.070
Ten grand, son, C.O.D. We will carve it.

10:29.112 --> 10:30.570
Uh, yeah, today's no good.

10:30.612 --> 10:32.112
The job's booked and it's good readies.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.528
I understand that, but
today is not a good day, Dad.

10:34.612 --> 10:37.778
Every day is a good day
for a bit of graft, Albert.

10:39.862 --> 10:42.403
Yeah, right. Go on, then. Yeah, I'll
do it. For seven and a half, though.

10:42.445 --> 10:44.112
You get two and a half for the booking.

10:44.153 --> 10:45.611
You negotiatin' with me, son?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.277
This is not a negotiation, Dad.

10:47.278 --> 10:48.944
Six for you, four for me, chop-chop.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.945
There you are, Mrs. Reid, your order.

11:00.987 --> 11:03.987
Oh, Lily. It looks just
like his favorite shooter.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.653
You've done us proud.

11:05.695 --> 11:07.153
I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:07.195 --> 11:08.903
John'll love it.

11:08.945 --> 11:11.362
Well... would have.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.737
- Just finishing up.
- Won't be a minute.

11:15.278 --> 11:17.445
Course... he would've been balls-deep

11:17.487 --> 11:20.320
in all that bullion hoo-ha, daft sod.

11:20.362 --> 11:23.653
Worth millions, I heard. Every
face in the manor is sniffin' about.

11:23.737 --> 11:25.444
Oh, bunch of prats.

11:25.445 --> 11:28.612
That much gold's nothing but
a travel-card to the coroner.

11:28.653 --> 11:30.070
Or the clink.

11:31.862 --> 11:35.112
Prosperity. Power. Punana.

11:38.445 --> 11:41.862
Prosperity. Power. Punana.

11:44.528 --> 11:47.362
Sonny? We got company.

11:53.528 --> 11:57.862
You have any... idea what it is to dance

11:57.945 --> 11:59.778
on the steps of Shangri-la?

12:05.820 --> 12:09.195
"This town is like a great big pussy,

12:09.220 --> 12:11.611
"just waitin' to get fucked!"

12:12.058 --> 12:13.724
"Hoo-hah!"

12:18.445 --> 12:21.278
You think all Cubans are gangsters?

12:21.320 --> 12:22.737
I got my MBA!

12:23.903 --> 12:26.737
I graduated summa cum laude.

12:26.778 --> 12:29.112
I speak five languages.

12:29.153 --> 12:31.820
I was voted most likely to succeed.

12:31.862 --> 12:33.487
And succeed you have, my friend.

12:33.528 --> 12:35.903
What do you want, Fink?

12:35.945 --> 12:37.570
I wanna talk...

12:40.612 --> 12:42.528
- about a truck...
- A truck?

12:42.612 --> 12:44.425
Sonny, you and I,

12:44.450 --> 12:47.011
we got a good thing goin' here.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.403
This arrangement works
well, I stay in my corner,

12:49.445 --> 12:52.445
- you play in yours...
- Get to the fuckin' point.

13:08.862 --> 13:10.028
Ambitious.

13:11.487 --> 13:13.112
- When and where?
- Five a.m. this morning,

13:13.153 --> 13:15.320
the crossroads behind the strip.

13:19.778 --> 13:25.112
A Donmar truck, a little
off-the-books spot, under the arches.

13:25.153 --> 13:26.487
Anything else come to mind?

13:26.528 --> 13:28.501
Go away, Fink.

13:28.526 --> 13:31.969
I gotta get my... shuffle on.

13:42.737 --> 13:46.278
Our truck takes that route
at 5 a.m. You see somethin'?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.820
I didn't see nothing.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.070
Aah!

13:53.320 --> 13:54.862
Where the fuck is Lotti?

13:54.903 --> 13:56.320
Haven't seen her since the fight.

13:58.153 --> 14:00.653
Where is that crazy bitch?

14:00.695 --> 14:01.820
Lotti!

14:05.862 --> 14:08.277
I lost my teddy bear.

14:08.278 --> 14:09.570
Can I give you a hug instead, darling?

14:09.612 --> 14:11.320
Your boss send you to keep an eye on me?

14:11.403 --> 14:12.444
No, two eyes.

14:12.445 --> 14:14.653
And he ain't my boss.

14:14.737 --> 14:16.737
You always do what Albert says?

14:16.778 --> 14:19.278
When I fancy the job.

14:19.362 --> 14:21.570
I'll get my share of that gold.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.237
One way or another.

14:23.278 --> 14:25.278
Well, I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

14:28.778 --> 14:30.737
Fancy a ride?

14:30.778 --> 14:32.945
I don't mess around with the errand boy.

14:35.112 --> 14:36.278
I'll be at the gym on Upper Street

14:36.320 --> 14:37.903
when you change your mind.

14:51.272 --> 14:53.178
Beautiful. Okay.

14:53.576 --> 14:56.253
Lean into me. Oh, that's lovely.

14:56.278 --> 14:59.903
Yes! Oh, my angel, that's...
Love it so, that is gorgeous.

14:59.945 --> 15:01.862
Beautiful, now, yes...

15:03.195 --> 15:05.612
We have a situation, Master Charles.

15:05.695 --> 15:08.862
Uh, father has misplaced
his Volcano vaporizer?

15:08.903 --> 15:13.362
The whereabouts of a
certain gold fob watch.

15:14.487 --> 15:16.153
Gold fob watch?

15:16.195 --> 15:21.195
Lord Cavendish has implied
that I purloined the time piece.

15:21.237 --> 15:26.277
After 30 years of loyal appointment,
I have been impeached, Master Charles!

15:26.278 --> 15:28.111
This century English, please, Staff!

15:28.112 --> 15:30.695
The bugger thinks I
nicked his blood watch,

15:30.778 --> 15:32.778
and unless it's returned...

15:34.612 --> 15:36.570
he's giving me the boot!

15:39.737 --> 15:45.612
Well... there... there's been a lot of
break-ins, in the neighborhood recently.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.112
Now, I mean, it's obvious
we've been targeted.

15:49.778 --> 15:52.778
I... I... I may know a
man who might known a man

15:52.820 --> 15:54.112
who might know something.

15:55.278 --> 15:57.070
Uh, leave it with me.

16:07.112 --> 16:08.320
Good morning,

16:08.362 --> 16:10.028
Mr. Cavendish-Scott, how are you?

16:10.112 --> 16:12.862
About that watch I brought in
the other day, I need it returned.

16:12.945 --> 16:15.777
- Oh, it's no longer in stock.
- We sold it.

16:15.778 --> 16:17.112
You sold it?

16:18.612 --> 16:20.778
How much did it go for?

16:20.820 --> 16:22.903
Decent price... book value.

16:24.112 --> 16:26.195
You made out on it, didn't you?

16:26.237 --> 16:29.195
Go on, how much? Couple of grand?

16:30.278 --> 16:31.987
Five?

16:32.028 --> 16:33.320
Ten?

16:33.362 --> 16:34.528
We had a very keen buyer.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.612
Ten grand? You only
gave me a measly 3,000.

16:37.653 --> 16:40.153
What kind of businesswoman are you?

16:40.195 --> 16:43.112
Okay, well, uh, can you get it back?

16:43.153 --> 16:44.528
I'll see what I can do.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.820
Okay. Good.

16:49.195 --> 16:50.862
Good. Um...

16:50.945 --> 16:54.277
And I was wondering... I mean, um...

16:54.278 --> 16:57.903
if you've not got any plans
this evening and, uh...

16:57.945 --> 16:59.777
we could...

17:07.944 --> 17:10.112
- What are you doin' here?
- What are you doing here?

17:10.194 --> 17:11.903
I got a sit down with Saul.

17:11.944 --> 17:14.578
Huh, Saul Gold? What's the gig?

17:16.487 --> 17:18.819
You can go on your way.
Go on, you can jog on now.

17:18.862 --> 17:21.487
Yeah, this one's mine.

17:21.528 --> 17:22.587
Okay?

17:23.569 --> 17:24.819
Okay.

17:30.612 --> 17:33.777
You pick up my clients, the
Heimels, from the airport,

17:33.778 --> 17:36.112
and you bring 'em back directly to me.

17:36.153 --> 17:37.653
That's all. Couldn't be more simple.

17:37.695 --> 17:40.237
How many Heimels are
we expecting, Mr. Gold?

17:40.278 --> 17:43.112
Enough to wipe your ass when
you shit yourself, bubbeleh.

17:43.153 --> 17:44.278
Oh, yeah...

17:44.320 --> 17:46.111
Who cares how many?

17:46.112 --> 17:50.444
Just pick 'em up, toss 'em
in the van, bring 'em here.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.903
- And that's worth ten grand?
- On delivery.

17:53.945 --> 17:56.487
What else are we transportin'
other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?

18:01.570 --> 18:04.987
You're tryin' my patience, boy.

18:05.028 --> 18:07.112
Well, thank you for considerin'
us, Mr. Gold, but with respect,

18:07.153 --> 18:09.028
I'm gonna have to decline your offer.

18:09.070 --> 18:11.278
If I don't know what I'm transportin',
I cannot guarantee delivery.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.028
You're not like your old man, are you?

18:13.112 --> 18:15.612
Ol' Vic, he'd be halfway
to Gatwick by now.

18:15.653 --> 18:18.444
Yeah, a lot's changed since
my dad's day, Mr. Gold.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.737
Too many chancers out there
lookin' for a quick score nowadays.

18:20.778 --> 18:23.111
I'm sure you're well aware an
armored truck got rolled, last night,

18:23.112 --> 18:24.945
transport's a risky business.

18:30.237 --> 18:32.277
Diamonds.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.778
A fistful.

18:34.945 --> 18:36.277
Now you in or you out?

18:36.278 --> 18:37.487
- I'm in.
- Splendid.

18:37.528 --> 18:38.820
For 15 grand.

18:40.737 --> 18:43.903
- You guarantee delivery?
- Guaranteed.

18:45.903 --> 18:48.229
Van, driver, out the back.

18:48.848 --> 18:50.136
Piss off.

18:53.695 --> 18:56.653
Left. The left, the left, the
left! Left side of the road.

18:56.695 --> 18:59.111
Pardon. This is my first
time driving in the UK.

18:59.112 --> 19:02.320
- Really?
- Everything's on the wrong bloody side.

19:02.403 --> 19:05.320
You're a Froggy. Frenchman.

19:05.403 --> 19:07.944
Why... why... why are you the driver?

19:07.945 --> 19:12.070
Uncle Saul wanted a family
member... on the mission.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.010
Is that all you got for me, McLeod?

19:21.035 --> 19:23.570
Pig masks and overalls?

19:23.612 --> 19:25.070
Get out!

19:36.320 --> 19:38.320
"Is that all you've got for me, McLeod?"

19:38.362 --> 19:40.695
Well, I've got something
for you all right, darlin'!

19:42.945 --> 19:47.153
You know, my father said to me,
he said, "Son, it don't matter

19:47.237 --> 19:49.778
"if you got a two-inch prick,

19:49.820 --> 19:53.016
"just make sure you hold
it like a baseball bat."

19:53.041 --> 19:54.444
You what?

19:54.445 --> 19:56.944
It's all right, McLeod, Dwyer
does that to all the boys.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.195
- Makes us feel, well...
- Like dickless twats?

20:01.403 --> 20:03.320
Like dickless twats.

20:10.153 --> 20:13.445
Ooh. Looks painful.

20:13.487 --> 20:17.195
The wee shite trapped my
hand in the truck door.

20:17.278 --> 20:19.278
So is Dwyer gonna set up
an identity parade, then?

20:19.320 --> 20:20.944
She hasn't briefed me yet.

20:20.945 --> 20:23.777
Like I told Dwyer, he was
wearin' a pig mask and overalls.

20:23.778 --> 20:27.403
Did he squeal like a pig?

20:27.445 --> 20:29.777
No. He put on a silly,
wee voice, you know...

20:29.778 --> 20:33.417
"Oh, no, you bloody
well, don't." Posh, like.

20:33.612 --> 20:35.112
Posh?

21:02.528 --> 21:05.320
So, I take it you got through
customs okay, Mr. Heimel?

21:10.278 --> 21:14.278
You guys must really stand
out in those liveries.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.779
Yeah, I would've gone with
something a little more... incognito.

21:18.945 --> 21:22.945
Where can we have a
little fun around here?

21:23.028 --> 21:25.653
- Um...
- What kind of fun are you referring to?

21:25.695 --> 21:28.278
Mad fun! Dawg.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.778
Well, you can have all
the mad fun you want

21:29.820 --> 21:31.528
once we've dropped
you off at Saul Gold's.

21:33.028 --> 21:36.862
All work and no play
makes Abel a dull boy.

No catch.

You earned it.

23:19.778 --> 23:22.362
A truck got heisted last night.

23:22.403 --> 23:25.944
Three banditos, in masks.

23:25.945 --> 23:28.945
Rock and roll.

23:28.987 --> 23:33.528
Truck got hit the exact same
time that our truck went out.

23:34.987 --> 23:37.195
On the exact same route.

23:37.237 --> 23:40.237
Maybe they were goin' after
your truck and hit the wrong one.

23:45.278 --> 23:47.445
You're a smart girl, Lotti.

23:49.653 --> 23:50.820
But are you too smart?

23:50.862 --> 23:52.945
What are you talkin' about, Sonny?

23:54.903 --> 23:56.487
Tell me you don't know.

23:57.653 --> 24:00.487
I don't know. All right?

24:07.862 --> 24:12.237
- Well, if you hear anything...
- from around the way...

24:13.487 --> 24:14.737
you let me know.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.820
You'll be the first.

24:28.028 --> 24:29.944
Ah!

24:29.945 --> 24:31.362
Hello, my love.

24:31.445 --> 24:32.445
Hi, darlin'.

24:32.446 --> 24:33.653
What's wrong?

24:33.695 --> 24:35.277
Mrs. Reid not like the wreath?

24:35.278 --> 24:36.945
No, no, she liked it, all right.

24:36.987 --> 24:38.945
You missin' me, then?

24:42.445 --> 24:44.612
Do you know there's
gold on the street, Vic?

24:46.237 --> 24:47.778
Armored truck heist.

24:49.028 --> 24:53.278
Well, I um... I did hear a rumor.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.278
Just... got me thinking,
it brought up some feelings.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.695
What kind of feelings?

25:00.862 --> 25:02.903
You don't think it
was your gold, do you?

25:04.695 --> 25:09.862
Sweetheart...

25:09.945 --> 25:12.277
my gold is long gone.

25:12.278 --> 25:15.711
Fifteen years of battles
and bodies have seen to that.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.737
How can you know for sure?

25:17.778 --> 25:19.737
Am I hearin' right?

25:19.778 --> 25:22.444
Year after year you been tellin'
me to get it out of my head.

25:22.445 --> 25:25.362
It's taken me 15 years,
Lily, but I've done just that.

25:25.403 --> 25:27.528
Now, you want me
thinkin' about it again.

25:27.570 --> 25:29.695
What's gotten into you, huh?

25:29.737 --> 25:31.903
That much gold bullion doesn't
crop up on a daily basis

25:31.945 --> 25:34.612
around here, Vic.

25:34.653 --> 25:37.737
It's just... a little bit
close to home, that's all.

25:37.778 --> 25:39.153
Are you saying you want me to go get it?

25:39.195 --> 25:40.362
No, absolutely not.

25:40.403 --> 25:42.820
Because I am stuck in here, Lily.

25:42.862 --> 25:45.028
How the fuck... am I gonna get it?

25:45.070 --> 25:47.153
I don't want you to get
it. You're not listening.

25:47.195 --> 25:50.195
I was just... shaken up by hearing
them moan, all their husbands

25:50.278 --> 25:52.195
sniffing about for it.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.611
Which husbands?

25:56.612 --> 25:58.444
- Who's sniffin'?
- Oh, God, Vic,

25:58.445 --> 26:00.153
that's not the point. It
doesn't matter who it was.

26:00.237 --> 26:01.570
I want names.

26:01.612 --> 26:03.611
For once can you just let me talk

26:03.612 --> 26:05.612
without making it about you.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.403
Domestic, Vic?

26:14.112 --> 26:15.612
I'll take that as a yes, then.

26:32.028 --> 26:33.778
He's in there, love.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.987
You really this broke?

26:43.070 --> 26:45.278
Or you workin' the
"hot struggling fighter

26:45.320 --> 26:47.612
livin' in this closet" angle?

26:47.653 --> 26:49.903
I didn't think you messed
around with the help.

26:55.445 --> 26:57.195
Who says I'm messin' around?

27:12.403 --> 27:14.487
Charlie, look at your
eyes. What have you done?

27:15.862 --> 27:19.111
- Life is a rocky road, Motek.
- Is it?

27:19.112 --> 27:21.777
You gotta loosen up your shit.

27:21.778 --> 27:22.820
Boobies!

27:23.820 --> 27:25.612
Don't pull over, Serge.

27:25.653 --> 27:27.112
Pull over or I paint the dash.

27:27.153 --> 27:29.778
I'm pulling over.

27:32.778 --> 27:34.737
You got punked, pussy.

27:50.528 --> 27:51.945
Sorry, boys.

27:55.653 --> 27:56.862
Saul!

27:57.945 --> 27:59.944
Yeah? Peachy, Mr. Gold,

27:59.945 --> 28:01.320
we'll be with you very shortly.

28:01.362 --> 28:03.320
Not you, kid.

28:06.403 --> 28:07.653
Ah-ah-ah.

28:41.112 --> 28:44.111
Mr. Heimel, I'm going to have to insist
we get back on the road immediately.

28:44.112 --> 28:47.737
- Mr. Gold is waiting for us.
- What is your rush, Albert?

28:47.778 --> 28:52.611
We're just... blowing
off a little steam!

28:54.695 --> 28:56.777
Charlie, come here. Charlie, get up!

28:56.778 --> 28:58.195
Charlie...

28:58.237 --> 28:59.945
Excuse me... can you
help me get these lunatics

29:00.028 --> 29:02.278
out of here now!

29:02.320 --> 29:05.362
Have I... have I ever
told you I love you!

29:05.403 --> 29:08.862
- Ey?
- I do. I mean, sometimes

29:08.903 --> 29:11.362
you can be a bit of a crashing bore,

29:11.403 --> 29:15.403
and you have a tendency of
being a little bit controlling.

29:15.445 --> 29:18.945
I... I really do have very
deep feelings for you...

29:18.987 --> 29:21.695
Shut up, come on, sit down
there. Sit down, sit down.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.820
Come on, Billy, come on, Billy.

29:26.862 --> 29:28.278
Come on, Billy, answer the phone.

29:36.103 --> 29:37.230
Shit!

29:44.820 --> 29:46.320
Hey, Boo! What's your sign?

29:46.362 --> 29:47.612
Get out before I call the bouncer!

29:47.653 --> 29:49.903
I got money to burn, baby girl.

29:49.945 --> 29:51.487
Piss off, kid.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.278
Would a kid have these?

30:03.112 --> 30:04.858
Get comfortable.

30:05.650 --> 30:07.844
I'll be right back, baby boy.

30:20.112 --> 30:22.070
- Hello?
- Manny.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.778
- Yeah?
- I've got something for you.

30:24.862 --> 30:27.320
Tell Sonny there's
diamonds on the scene.

30:27.362 --> 30:30.987
Oh!

30:45.153 --> 30:48.111
- Mr. Gold?
- Where are my diamonds?

30:48.112 --> 30:49.360
Where the hell are you?

30:49.385 --> 30:50.852
We're just stick in a bit
of traffic at the minute,

30:50.877 --> 30:52.252
we're on the way back into town now.

30:52.277 --> 30:53.445
We won't be long, all right?

30:53.470 --> 30:54.522
- Albert...
- I'll call you soon.

30:54.547 --> 30:56.172
Albert Hill!

30:58.112 --> 30:59.403
Fuck me!

31:08.695 --> 31:09.862
Oh, shit.

31:18.820 --> 31:22.028
Bomb Squad! Tryin' to get
you outside the back door!

31:29.320 --> 31:30.862
Don't shoot!

31:48.612 --> 31:50.653
Allez encule!

31:59.153 --> 32:01.237
Bad dream! Bad dream!

32:01.278 --> 32:02.987
Where is my Schmeckel?

32:03.028 --> 32:04.987
And where is my diamonds?

32:06.695 --> 32:07.820
Schmeckel!

32:26.570 --> 32:27.862
Go after them!

32:27.903 --> 32:28.944
They shot the tires out!

32:28.945 --> 32:30.111
They got the pouch!

32:30.112 --> 32:32.195
- What pouch?
- The bloody stones!

32:32.237 --> 32:33.903
- The diamonds?
- Yes, the bloody diamonds!

32:33.945 --> 32:35.903
- They've got the diamonds?
- How did they get the diamonds?

32:35.945 --> 32:38.237
- I thought he had the diamonds!
- Yes, the diamonds, you...

32:38.278 --> 32:41.278
Oh, I don't fucking believe this!

32:41.303 --> 32:42.362
Shit!

32:42.403 --> 32:44.653
Ah... ah!

32:44.695 --> 32:46.653
Ah...

32:46.695 --> 32:48.945
Who... who were those guys?

32:50.528 --> 32:53.763
Dropping pills... in a strip club...

32:53.788 --> 32:56.112
with a bag of diamonds!

32:56.153 --> 32:57.820
Might as well have put
out an advert, Charlie.

32:57.903 --> 33:01.320
What matters now is the stones are gone.

33:01.403 --> 33:04.528
Saul... he's gonna be very pissed.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.944
How are we gonna tell Saul
that we lost his stones?

33:06.945 --> 33:08.612
You can tell him
whatever you want, Motek.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.444
I'll be on my way, back to Brooklyn.

33:11.445 --> 33:14.362
Hey, not a chance. You are
coming with me to Saul to explain

33:14.403 --> 33:15.862
this whole shit show.

33:15.903 --> 33:19.278
You took the job of
delivering us to Saul.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.695
You didn't do your job.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.278
I'm not taking the fall for you, Bubba.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.569
I didn't do my job?

33:24.594 --> 33:25.903
I didn't do my job?

33:25.945 --> 33:27.403
I don't remember a part of this job

33:27.445 --> 33:29.487
where I shoved those
Mollys down your throat!

33:29.528 --> 33:32.445
You need to be a
little bit more decisive

33:32.487 --> 33:36.112
if you're gonna prosper
in this line of work...

33:36.153 --> 33:37.192
Albert.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.533
_

33:40.945 --> 33:44.111
There you go. See? You are coming

33:44.112 --> 33:47.028
with me to Saul Gold, and that is final!

33:51.278 --> 33:55.549
To the airport, or we'll
bleed you out like a chazzer.

33:56.570 --> 33:58.278
It's a pig.

34:07.487 --> 34:09.902
Thanks for the good times, Bubba.

34:09.945 --> 34:13.945
You ever in Brooklyn,
make sure to look me up.

34:19.112 --> 34:21.777
It's been romantic, dawg.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.445
Ha...

34:25.152 --> 34:28.945
Sorry, Bubba. Just...
just had to be sure.

34:36.027 --> 34:37.221
Peace.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.777
So what now, then?

34:45.820 --> 34:48.862
Lie low in the Costa
Del Sol for a few weeks?

34:57.612 --> 34:59.862
You have got to be shitting me!

35:00.987 --> 35:02.320
Who's heisted my diamonds?

35:02.403 --> 35:04.320
I don't know yet, Mr. Gold.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.112
What do you know, boy?

35:07.778 --> 35:12.112
Are you okay, Mr. Cavendish-Scott?

35:12.195 --> 35:14.611
I've had better days, Chloe.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.112
And please call me Charlie.

35:16.195 --> 35:17.903
Strip club?

35:17.945 --> 35:20.553
Well, I've got some good news
that might cheer you up, Charlie.

35:20.578 --> 35:22.903
Oh... you have a spare bag of diamonds?

35:22.945 --> 35:24.653
I spoke to the man
who bought your watch.

35:24.695 --> 35:25.695
Mollys?

35:25.737 --> 35:27.737
Uh... and can you get it back?

35:27.778 --> 35:29.320
For 20,000 I can.

35:29.362 --> 35:31.903
Motorbike gang?

35:31.945 --> 35:33.903
Twenty grand? I thought
you sold it for 10.

35:33.945 --> 35:35.820
- And resold for 20.
- Don't kill the messenger,

35:35.862 --> 35:38.278
I can't control market fluctuation.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.278
Shot my nephew?

35:42.112 --> 35:43.820
I don't have 20,000.

35:44.903 --> 35:46.612
Well...

35:46.653 --> 35:49.820
do you have access to any
other kind of collateral?

35:52.570 --> 35:53.945
Possibly.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.862
Why did I trust the
Hill family with this?

35:57.903 --> 36:01.112
Your old man has always
been a liability, and you...

36:01.153 --> 36:03.153
you done the family legacy proud.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.903
Mr. Gold, this is on me, not my dad.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.487
Ah, no, no, no. You made a
guarantee. A guarantee is a guarantee.

36:07.528 --> 36:09.737
It's a famiy affair now, boy.

36:09.778 --> 36:13.403
I want my diamonds back in 48 hours,
or I want their market equivalent,

36:13.445 --> 36:17.028
which is 250 grand, or
I will cut off your cock.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.945
I'll put it in a pickle jar.

36:21.987 --> 36:24.320
Do you understand me, boy?

36:24.403 --> 36:27.277
Yeah, I understand you, Mr. Gold.

36:27.278 --> 36:29.944
I just thought, you know, if I
got loved up with the Heimels,

36:29.945 --> 36:32.403
I could keep an eye on them.

36:32.445 --> 36:33.862
I thought I was doing
the right thing, Al.

36:33.903 --> 36:35.570
You wouldn't know the
right thing if it kicked you

36:35.612 --> 36:36.612
in the bollocks, Charlie.

36:36.613 --> 36:37.778
Well, that's a bit strong, mate.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.278
No, I'll tell you what's a bit strong...

36:39.362 --> 36:40.820
Saul Gold threatening to cut my cock off

36:40.862 --> 36:43.112
and stick it in a pickle jar
unless I get him his stones

36:43.153 --> 36:45.903
or 250 grand in 48 hours.

36:45.928 --> 36:47.398
So unless you feel like
cashin' in your trust fund

36:47.425 --> 36:48.800
to bail me out, how
are you gonna help me?

36:48.842 --> 36:50.259
You know I don't have
a bloody trust fund!

36:50.300 --> 36:51.467
So how are you gonna help me?

37:01.550 --> 37:03.050
You gonna invite me in for a drink?

37:03.092 --> 37:05.050
You wanna get your brains blown out?

37:06.259 --> 37:09.675
Billy Ayres... hard as nails.

37:11.884 --> 37:13.549
I thought you were leavin' that prick.

37:13.550 --> 37:16.790
I will... when the time's right.

37:17.980 --> 37:20.229
How about I call you tomorrow?

37:20.230 --> 37:22.396
You can keep two eyes
on me all afternoon.

37:24.021 --> 37:25.775
I'll see what I've got on.

37:27.095 --> 37:28.929
Don't go spending my gold.

37:30.595 --> 37:32.929
No idea what you're talkin' about, girl.

38:35.262 --> 38:37.262
You ever seen a diamond
as sweet as that?

38:37.345 --> 38:40.055
They're actually sweet, Manny.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.553
I'm gonna make me a crown outta these.

38:47.845 --> 38:50.179
You see, Albert Hill didn't
know what hit him, boss.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.470
You did good, man.

38:53.943 --> 38:55.518
Put 'em in the safe.

38:55.554 --> 38:56.595
Gotcha.

39:03.804 --> 39:05.886
Well, this is intriguing.

39:05.887 --> 39:07.386
Back alleys and illicit meetings.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.429
What have you got for me, Charlie?

39:09.470 --> 39:10.720
What are you doing?

39:12.554 --> 39:14.220
Oh, my God.

39:17.595 --> 39:19.917
Oh, my God!

39:20.179 --> 39:21.554
Where did you get these?

39:21.637 --> 39:23.970
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

39:24.012 --> 39:25.512
What do you want me to do with them?

39:25.554 --> 39:27.679
Sell them, and get me back my watch.

39:27.720 --> 39:28.954
Gold's at a premium right now,

39:28.979 --> 39:30.929
I should be able to get
you an excellent valuation.

39:30.970 --> 39:32.870
Yeah, one small hitch.

39:32.895 --> 39:34.220
Go on.

39:34.262 --> 39:36.804
They're stolen. Most
likely more than once.

39:36.845 --> 39:38.887
So be very careful who you solicit.

39:38.929 --> 39:43.512
And here I thought you guys were
just a couple of small-time hustlers.

39:43.537 --> 39:45.553
Does Albert know about this?

39:45.554 --> 39:48.220
Well, I'm growing the operation.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.804
Yeah. Big things ahead.

39:50.887 --> 39:52.386
And if you play this right,

39:52.387 --> 39:55.387
there might be a lot
more where that came from.

40:43.054 --> 40:44.220
Posh.

40:54.679 --> 40:56.512
Happy New Year, Dad.

40:56.554 --> 40:57.762
Take this.

40:58.929 --> 41:00.429
Lucky charm.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.929
Fuck.

41:20.012 --> 41:21.554
Dad's gold.
