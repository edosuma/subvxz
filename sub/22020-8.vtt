WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:03.101
Thanks for coming, Hank.

00:03.203 --> 00:05.045
I know this isn't your style,

00:05.070 --> 00:07.015
but I like to show you off
from time to time.

00:07.076 --> 00:08.630
Listen, I'm glad to be here.

00:08.773 --> 00:10.441
There's not too many politicians

00:10.475 --> 00:14.011
willing to publically support
the police these days.

00:14.045 --> 00:17.081
- I got to go press the flesh.
- Do it.

00:17.115 --> 00:18.315
Hey.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.017
How'd you get dragged into this?

00:20.051 --> 00:22.986
Uh, my friend...
my boyfriend invited me.

00:23.021 --> 00:24.688
He worked with Congressman
Graynor a few years back

00:24.723 --> 00:26.023
at the State's Attorney's Office.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.025
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.

00:28.059 --> 00:30.260
I mean, the last time I wore
this was my aunt's funeral.

00:30.295 --> 00:32.095
Oh, glad you're getting
some use out of it.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.831
Thanks.

00:33.865 --> 00:36.767
So where is this new guy?

00:36.801 --> 00:38.342
Running late. I don't know.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.921
It's a busy man.
Federal prosecutor now, right?

00:40.952 --> 00:43.040
- Yeah, it's very fancy.
- Mm.

00:43.114 --> 00:44.648
- Oh, there he is. Matt.
- Oh, hey.

00:44.673 --> 00:46.074
- Hi.
- Wow.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.664
You sure you're really a cop?

00:47.704 --> 00:50.506
Okay, Matt, this is
Sergeant Hank Voight.

00:50.541 --> 00:51.674
Otherwise known as my boss

00:51.708 --> 00:52.842
- so be nice.
- Ah.

00:52.876 --> 00:54.110
Nice to meet you, Sergeant.

00:54.144 --> 00:57.346
Hank. All right, have fun.

00:57.381 --> 01:00.216
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just been a crazy day.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.518
I'm in the middle of that RICO
case, and it's heating up so...

01:02.553 --> 01:04.287
Oh, I knew how this goes: too much work.

01:04.321 --> 01:05.955
Too busy, no time for a relationship.

01:05.989 --> 01:07.957
Wow, well, that's a jaded way
to look at it.

01:07.991 --> 01:10.226
Oh, yeah? What's the rosy,
optimistic way?

01:10.260 --> 01:13.396
The fact that I didn't cancel
tonight in the middle

01:13.430 --> 01:15.531
of the most important
investigation of my life

01:15.566 --> 01:18.768
on the cusp of taking
down the Odessa mob

01:18.802 --> 01:21.304
is an obvious indication
of how important you are to me.

01:21.338 --> 01:23.906
- Ooh, you're good.
- I know.

01:26.944 --> 01:29.045
Thank you all for coming.

01:29.079 --> 01:31.380
And thank you to our host,
Jason Cassidy,

01:31.415 --> 01:34.083
for opening up his lovely home.

01:34.117 --> 01:37.386
I am running for re-election.
That's no secret.

01:37.421 --> 01:40.823
Neither is Chicago's reputation.

01:40.858 --> 01:42.825
We have fallen on hard times.

01:42.860 --> 01:47.330
Quite simply the Chicago Police
Department is under fire.

01:47.364 --> 01:51.567
Rather than attacking them,
we should be supporting them.

01:51.602 --> 01:54.570
Because they are the best
in the business.

01:54.605 --> 01:56.405
I know that first hand.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.307
As a prosecutor, I have worked alongside

01:58.342 --> 02:01.577
these selfless and
courageous folks for years.

02:01.612 --> 02:05.414
Like my friend, Sergeant Hank Voight.

02:05.449 --> 02:06.949
Make no mistake.

02:06.984 --> 02:08.783
These brave men and women

02:08.818 --> 02:11.520
are and will continue to be

02:11.555 --> 02:14.924
our precious city's saving grace.

02:21.899 --> 02:23.266
I don't want to bother you with this,

02:23.300 --> 02:25.167
but I'm just giving you a head's up.

02:25.202 --> 02:28.170
- I just got a call from IAD.
- About what?

02:28.205 --> 02:30.473
About the fight at the bar
when I was undercover.

02:30.507 --> 02:32.441
The kidnapping case?
Who knew about that?

02:32.476 --> 02:35.378
Upton, Atwater,
the two narcotics cops we used,

02:35.412 --> 02:37.546
and Ruzek. He wrote the paper on it.

02:37.581 --> 02:39.849
But I know for a fact
that he didn't put anything

02:39.883 --> 02:40.883
in the case report about it.

02:40.918 --> 02:42.184
Just keep it simple.

02:42.219 --> 02:43.519
You were undercover. Fight broke out.

02:43.553 --> 02:44.787
Guy rushed at you with a beer bottle.

02:46.156 --> 02:47.456
You were in fear of imminent bodily harm

02:47.491 --> 02:49.625
so you defended yourself. Hold on.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.960
Voight.

02:50.994 --> 02:52.895
Right now?

02:52.930 --> 02:54.997
I'm on my way.

02:55.032 --> 02:57.700
Hey.

02:57.734 --> 02:59.568
Everything okay?

02:59.603 --> 03:02.071
I'm just...

03:02.105 --> 03:03.339
I got to ask, you didn't file

03:03.373 --> 03:06.309
anything about the fight, did you?

03:06.343 --> 03:08.411
Are you seriously asking me that?

03:08.445 --> 03:11.180
I didn't think so.
I just wanted to check.

03:14.251 --> 03:17.253
Look, I think after
everything that happened

03:17.287 --> 03:20.156
you should consider talking to somebody.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.824
I'm good.

03:21.858 --> 03:23.259
Thanks for the suggestion.

03:23.293 --> 03:25.494
You sure? Things got pretty intense.

03:25.529 --> 03:27.330
We saved a kid's life.
That's all that matters.

03:27.364 --> 03:29.699
Yeah, I agree,
but you just want to make sure

03:29.733 --> 03:32.168
that nothing got triggered.

03:32.202 --> 03:34.737
Hailey, I appreciate
you looking out for me.

03:34.771 --> 03:37.006
I do, really.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.176
I'm fine, and I don't need a babysitter.

03:40.210 --> 03:42.178
Copy you.

03:45.382 --> 03:47.016
All right, what do we know so far?

03:47.050 --> 03:48.584
Somebody complained

03:48.618 --> 03:50.553
that there was an alarm clock
that wouldn't shut off

03:50.587 --> 03:52.788
so a hotel manager knocked on the door,

03:52.823 --> 03:55.024
didn't get a response,
and when he opened it

03:55.058 --> 03:56.525
he found a dead girl

03:56.560 --> 03:58.861
and a male guest passed out on the bed.

03:58.895 --> 04:00.796
- Gun?
- Nine millimeter.

04:00.831 --> 04:02.064
It was there next to the bed.

04:04.568 --> 04:06.902
Where's the male guest now?

04:06.937 --> 04:10.206
In here, Sarge.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.182 --> 04:20.583
Congressman.

04:20.617 --> 04:24.487
I know what this looks
like, Hank, but...

04:24.521 --> 04:26.555
I didn't do it.

04:26.590 --> 04:28.257
I swear to God.

04:31.678 --> 04:35.317
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

04:35.342 --> 04:36.450
Victim's a Jane Doe.

04:36.475 --> 04:37.933
Prints weren't in the system.
No cell phone.

04:37.968 --> 04:39.068
Only thing they found in her purse

04:39.102 --> 04:40.269
was a fake driver's license.

04:40.303 --> 04:41.837
The name on it was Yasmine Molt.

04:41.872 --> 04:43.305
We'll run it.
We'll see if anything hits.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.907
Anything on the gun?

04:44.941 --> 04:46.575
Unregistered. Suppresser attached.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.277
And the serial number was defaced.

04:48.311 --> 04:50.780
The only print they lifted off
of it was Graynor's.

04:50.814 --> 04:53.315
- GSR on his hands?
- Negative, but you know what?

04:53.350 --> 04:56.085
He could have washed up
before patrol got there.

04:56.119 --> 04:57.486
16 round mag, assuming it was full,

04:57.521 --> 04:59.255
at least two bullets were fired.

04:59.289 --> 05:00.790
Yeah, the victim was only shot once.

05:00.824 --> 05:02.591
- Did you find the other bullet?
- Mm-mm, no.

05:02.626 --> 05:04.927
- No shell casings either.
- Run ballistics.

05:04.961 --> 05:07.096
Who knows, maybe it will
connect to another crime.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.597
Okay.

05:08.632 --> 05:10.266
Start at the beginning, Scott.

05:10.300 --> 05:15.337
Just walk us through what happened.

05:15.372 --> 05:17.339
I came back from the party.

05:17.374 --> 05:19.608
I had a drink at the hotel bar.

05:19.643 --> 05:21.277
Started going through some emails

05:21.311 --> 05:24.113
and then this young lady
started talking to me.

05:24.147 --> 05:25.481
You get her name?

05:25.515 --> 05:27.850
I think she said it was Yasmine.

05:27.884 --> 05:29.185
- Hooker?
- Possible.

05:29.219 --> 05:30.619
She had an accent.

05:30.654 --> 05:33.055
It was eastern European, maybe Russian.

05:33.090 --> 05:34.857
So what you guys talk about?

05:34.891 --> 05:36.125
Not sure.

05:36.159 --> 05:38.027
Well, explain that to me.

05:38.061 --> 05:40.629
My memory's... blurry.

05:40.664 --> 05:42.498
You remember inviting her to your room?

05:42.532 --> 05:46.302
No, but I can't imagine
that I really did. I...

05:46.336 --> 05:48.137
I don't cheat on my wife,

05:48.171 --> 05:53.075
and yes, I know that sounds
absurd given the circumstances.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.578
She must have drugged me when
I got up to go to the restroom.

05:55.612 --> 05:57.313
That is the only thing that makes sense.

05:57.347 --> 05:59.148
I have never blacked out before.

05:59.182 --> 06:02.051
Okay, so...

06:02.085 --> 06:04.386
She drugged you. You went upstairs.

06:04.421 --> 06:06.388
Then you passed out,

06:06.423 --> 06:10.025
and some guy other than you
comes in, shoots the girl,

06:10.060 --> 06:12.895
puts the gun in your hand, gets
your fingerprints all over it,

06:12.929 --> 06:15.731
then tosses the gun
on the ground and walks out.

06:15.765 --> 06:19.201
Hm?

06:19.236 --> 06:20.936
That's a hell of a theory, Scott.

06:20.971 --> 06:22.838
Somebody must have set me up.

06:22.873 --> 06:25.207
It is the only plausible explanation

06:25.242 --> 06:27.710
to this totally implausible situation.

06:27.744 --> 06:29.411
Any idea who might want to do that?

06:29.446 --> 06:31.847
- Too many to count.
- How's that?

06:31.882 --> 06:34.783
I voted against a major
construction project

06:34.818 --> 06:36.385
in the 53rd Ward.

06:36.419 --> 06:38.354
And after that the deal fell apart.

06:38.388 --> 06:40.089
Then the people who lost out
came after me.

06:40.123 --> 06:43.025
There was verbal attacks
on social media, slashed tires.

06:43.059 --> 06:46.462
Every builder and union rep
and alderman in this city

06:46.496 --> 06:48.531
would love to see me fail.

06:48.565 --> 06:50.366
Look, guys, Congressman Graynor

06:50.400 --> 06:53.536
clearly needs some rest.
I assume he's free to go?

06:53.570 --> 06:55.204
We're gonna keep him in custody

06:55.238 --> 06:56.705
a little longer
until we can clear this up.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.642
Just sit tight, Scott.
Let us do our job.

06:59.676 --> 07:01.710
We'll figure out what the hell
really happened here.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.078
Unless he's under arrest,

07:03.113 --> 07:04.246
we're walking out of here.

07:04.281 --> 07:06.415
No, it's all right, Mike.

07:06.449 --> 07:08.784
I trust Sergeant Voight.

07:08.818 --> 07:12.221
Do what you need to do.
I got nothing to hide.

07:12.255 --> 07:15.291
The only thing I ask is...

07:15.325 --> 07:18.394
keep this out of the press.

07:18.428 --> 07:20.963
I'll do my best but...

07:20.997 --> 07:24.533
the evidence goes against you,
all bets are off.

07:32.442 --> 07:34.109
This is a feed from last night.

07:34.144 --> 07:36.045
There's your man at the bar.

07:39.716 --> 07:41.917
Well, Graynor seems
to be enjoying himself.

07:41.952 --> 07:45.454
Hell yeah.

07:45.488 --> 07:48.591
- Wait, wait, what happened?
- No idea.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.292
Uh, can you fast forward that for me?

07:50.327 --> 07:52.828
Let's see how long it stays off.

07:55.632 --> 07:59.468
Oh. Okay, went out at 10:02.
Came back online at 10:46.

07:59.502 --> 08:01.503
Same time the Jane Doe was murdered.

08:01.538 --> 08:04.673
Yeah, that is a hell of a coincidence.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.108
You know who was on duty last night?

08:06.142 --> 08:07.476
Guy named Luke Ivey.

08:07.510 --> 08:08.644
He's been with us for about three years,

08:08.678 --> 08:10.145
but he's a pretty mellow guy.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.480
Can't imagine he's involved in this.

08:11.514 --> 08:12.881
All right, well, we're gonna need

08:12.916 --> 08:15.451
his contact information right now.

08:15.485 --> 08:17.319
I got a medical prescription
for the weed,

08:17.354 --> 08:18.721
- so it's totally legit...
- We're not here

08:18.755 --> 08:20.656
- about your weed.
- We're actually here

08:20.690 --> 08:22.524
about last night.
You were working security

08:22.559 --> 08:24.460
- at the Bainbridge, right?
- Oh, right.

08:24.494 --> 08:26.228
I heard a girl got killed or something?

08:26.263 --> 08:28.564
Yeah, and it just so happens
that the surveillance system

08:28.598 --> 08:30.299
was shut down at the time of the murder.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.734
Yeah, you know anything about that?

08:31.768 --> 08:33.534
You think somebody intentionally

08:33.570 --> 08:35.371
shut down the security system?

08:35.405 --> 08:37.039
It crossed our minds, yes.

08:37.073 --> 08:39.140
You were working between
10:00 and 11:00, right?

08:39.174 --> 08:40.643
Yeah, on and off.

08:40.677 --> 08:42.144
I spent half the time in the back room,

08:42.178 --> 08:43.511
watching a fight on TV.

08:43.546 --> 08:45.481
Luke, you ever seen this woman?

08:45.515 --> 08:47.016
- You recognize her?
- No.

08:47.050 --> 08:49.151
Never. She the one that got killed?

08:49.185 --> 08:51.420
Listen, the way this works is
that we ask the questions,

08:51.454 --> 08:53.155
- you answer.
- Sorry.

08:53.189 --> 08:55.324
My bad. Ask away.

08:55.358 --> 08:57.159
All right, so you didn't shut it down.

08:57.193 --> 08:58.327
Do you know who did?

08:58.361 --> 08:59.828
Could have been anyone.

08:59.863 --> 09:02.164
Lots of people have access to that room.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.835
- Scott Graynor?
- Yeah.

09:06.870 --> 09:08.937
- Yeah, I know him.
- You like him?

09:08.972 --> 09:11.907
No. He's a racist, right-wing prick.

09:11.941 --> 09:13.509
I'm not sure I agree with that,

09:13.543 --> 09:15.177
but that's not why I'm here, Ray.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.046
So why are you here?

09:17.080 --> 09:21.350
Off the record, we're looking
at him for a homicide.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.419
The facts are a bit odd.

09:23.453 --> 09:27.222
But Graynor claims he didn't do
it, thinks he was set up.

09:27.257 --> 09:28.624
That is possible.

09:28.658 --> 09:30.526
Ol' Scott isn't too popular around here,

09:30.560 --> 09:32.194
not right now anyway.

09:32.228 --> 09:34.563
Yeah, I mean, I heard
about the construction deal.

09:34.597 --> 09:37.199
Yeah, mixed-use, urban village,

09:37.233 --> 09:40.803
cafes, apartments, offices... it
would've been a game-changer.

09:40.837 --> 09:42.604
All right, what happened?

09:42.639 --> 09:45.708
Graynor redirected all
the federal dollars elsewhere.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.377
Gave some half-assed speech
about how he wanted

09:48.411 --> 09:51.313
more investments in more rural areas.

09:51.348 --> 09:52.614
The truth is the man doesn't believe

09:52.649 --> 09:54.049
in urban revitalization.

09:54.084 --> 09:55.584
The only thing
he wants to build in my ward

09:55.618 --> 09:56.952
is a damn prison.

09:56.986 --> 09:58.620
So Graynor's telling the truth

09:58.655 --> 10:00.556
- about having a lot of enemies.
- Yeah.

10:00.590 --> 10:02.224
You're damn right.

10:02.258 --> 10:05.060
Any idea who might be
at the top of the list?

10:05.095 --> 10:06.595
Bill Mahoney.

10:06.629 --> 10:09.264
He's the head of the Iron Workers Union.

10:09.299 --> 10:12.668
Appreciate it, Ray.

10:12.702 --> 10:15.904
No surprise, C.O.D. is exsanguination

10:15.939 --> 10:17.806
due to the bullet entering her chest.

10:17.841 --> 10:19.975
Huh. Any evidence of sexual activity?

10:20.009 --> 10:23.345
None. No traces of
third-party DNA, either.

10:23.380 --> 10:28.517
But I did find this
implanted in her upper arm.

10:28.551 --> 10:31.487
You don't see this every day.

10:44.578 --> 10:47.179
M.E. found a GPS chip in Jane Doe's arm.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.214
Like something you put
I love Cin a prized pet.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.683
Unfortunately, we can't track it.

10:51.718 --> 10:55.053
- Someone was tracking her.
- Yeah, probably the pimp.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.889
That's a pretty sophisticated pimp.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.818
Hey, tox report came back.

10:58.847 --> 11:00.348
Graynor was right,
about the drugs anyways.

11:00.373 --> 11:01.974
They found Ketamine and Oxy
in his blood.

11:02.008 --> 11:03.433
Well, that explains the blacking out.

11:03.512 --> 11:05.213
Yeah, but now the question is
did he drug himself?

11:05.247 --> 11:07.515
- Or was he drugged?
- I don't know, even if he took

11:07.550 --> 11:09.250
the drugs himself,
it still doesn't make sense.

11:09.285 --> 11:11.853
This shooting was premeditated.
The gun had a silencer.

11:11.887 --> 11:14.255
The odds of someone doing
a murder in that state of mind?

11:14.290 --> 11:15.890
- Pretty remote.
- Yeah, I agree.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.326
Either Graynor is
the dumbest criminal ever

11:18.361 --> 11:20.462
or somebody set him up.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.434
Bill Mahoney, how you doing?

11:26.469 --> 11:27.902
Just need to ask you a few questions.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.772
- About what?
- Congressman Graynor.

11:30.806 --> 11:32.407
Did he wind up dead or something?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.942
Well, that's an interesting response.

11:33.976 --> 11:36.077
I'm busy. What the hell is this about?

11:36.112 --> 11:37.746
Do you mind telling us
where you were last night?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.848
- Yes.
- Well, we're happy to take you

11:39.882 --> 11:41.416
down to the station if you prefer.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.218
You gonna tell me what this is about?

11:43.252 --> 11:45.620
Your name came up as a person
of interest in a homicide.

11:45.654 --> 11:47.856
- That's all I can say right now.
- Homicide?

11:47.890 --> 11:49.524
You think I'm involved in some murder?

11:49.558 --> 11:50.892
- That's crazy.
- Okay.

11:50.926 --> 11:52.193
So tell us where you were last night

11:52.228 --> 11:53.461
between 10:00 and 10:30.

11:53.496 --> 11:55.096
At the hospital.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.132
My sister had a baby girl.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.133
Jillian.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.768
Six pounds, nine ounces.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.404
Mom and baby are doing great,
thanks for asking.

12:02.438 --> 12:04.539
Now, if there's nothing else...

12:06.175 --> 12:07.909
Mahoney's alibi checks out.

12:07.943 --> 12:10.045
He was at Chicago Med
from 10:00 pm to 3:00 am.

12:10.079 --> 12:11.312
Which brings us back

12:11.347 --> 12:12.380
- to Graynor.
- I don't know.

12:12.415 --> 12:13.581
Whether or not you agree

12:13.616 --> 12:14.983
with his politics, he's clean.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.985
Northwestern. Served in the marines.

12:17.019 --> 12:19.254
Active in his church.
Married 17 years with two kids.

12:19.288 --> 12:21.489
Yeah, 'cause church-going men
never cheat on their wives.

12:21.524 --> 12:23.158
All right, what about our Jane Doe?

12:23.192 --> 12:24.993
- We find anything new?
- I talked to a pimp CI.

12:25.027 --> 12:26.928
He couldn't ID her,
but he said there are lots

12:26.962 --> 12:29.097
of Eastern European girls
working the Gold Coast hotels.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.765
Which jibes with Graynor's story.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.600
- He said the girl had an accent.
- Thanks.

12:32.635 --> 12:34.269
The gun that killed our Jane Doe

12:34.303 --> 12:36.438
just showed up in another
shooting, a woman, late 30s.

12:36.472 --> 12:37.672
Someone found her in a car last night

12:37.706 --> 12:39.274
two blocks from the Bainbridge.

12:39.308 --> 12:41.009
- She going to make it?
- Yeah.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.577
She just got out of surgery.
She's in stable condition.

12:42.611 --> 12:45.814
Let's go.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.315
Her name's Irina Petrova.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.683
Still a little groggy,

12:48.717 --> 12:50.251
keeps asking about her daughter.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.754
Thanks.

12:53.889 --> 12:56.758
Okay.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.693
Ma'am. I'm Sergeant Hank Voight.

12:58.727 --> 13:00.695
This is Detective Olinsky.

13:00.729 --> 13:03.098
We want to ask you
a couple of questions.

13:03.132 --> 13:05.133
Is my daughter okay?

13:05.167 --> 13:06.801
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

13:06.836 --> 13:10.071
Sasha. I'm very worried about her.

13:15.578 --> 13:18.146
That's our Jane Doe.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.152
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Your daughter's dead.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.458
Sasha?

13:30.493 --> 13:32.894
She's murdered?

13:32.928 --> 13:37.232
I'm afraid so.

13:50.279 --> 13:52.747
I think I know who he is.

13:52.781 --> 13:54.682
The man who killed her.

13:54.717 --> 13:56.151
That's great. Who is he?

13:56.185 --> 13:57.585
A man came

13:57.620 --> 13:59.154
and offered my daughter

13:59.188 --> 14:03.224
and her friend modeling contracts.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.594
So they came here to Chicago.

14:06.629 --> 14:09.397
Three months I hadn't heard from her.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.432
And I called and called.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.403
And then two weeks ago, I got a message.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.173
Sasha said she was...

14:18.207 --> 14:19.874
a hostage.

14:19.909 --> 14:23.444
That this man took
her passport and money

14:23.479 --> 14:26.614
and that he was watching her every move.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.283
Well, what'd you do?

14:28.317 --> 14:32.387
I bought a ticket,
and I came here myself.

14:32.421 --> 14:35.423
She's my daughter.

14:38.494 --> 14:40.795
I know this is hard, but...

14:40.829 --> 14:45.033
Do you think you could identify
the man who shot you?

14:50.172 --> 14:52.473
He's not here.

14:52.508 --> 14:55.310
He was younger and bald.

14:55.344 --> 14:57.145
And he was Ukrainian.

14:57.179 --> 15:00.114
- How do you know that?
- He called me "sooka."

15:00.149 --> 15:02.317
Before he shot me.

15:02.351 --> 15:05.220
That means bitch.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.826
The mom canvassed the Ukrainian village

15:11.860 --> 15:13.795
with a photo of her daughter Sasha.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.264
Found some guy works at a
grocery store recognized her.

15:16.298 --> 15:18.266
Apparently, she and
the other girls buy food there.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.968
Yeah, so Irina paid the guy

15:20.002 --> 15:22.837
100 bucks to smuggle a burner
phone into her groceries.

15:22.871 --> 15:25.240
Sasha texts her mom
and they hatch an escape plan.

15:25.274 --> 15:27.508
But someone found the phone
before they could pull it off.

15:27.543 --> 15:29.177
Hey, guys.

15:29.211 --> 15:31.045
I got something.

15:33.315 --> 15:35.617
All right, I pulled this
from a security camera

15:35.651 --> 15:37.085
two blocks away from the Bainbridge.

15:37.119 --> 15:39.320
That's Irina in her rental car.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.122
Look at the time stamp. 10:22.

15:41.156 --> 15:42.924
It's around the same time
Sasha was killed.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.126
Yeah, but first he tries
taking out the mom.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.495
So he shoots Irina, and then
he walks over to the hotel

15:47.529 --> 15:50.431
and he kills her daughter.

15:50.466 --> 15:52.133
All right, blow that image up,

15:52.167 --> 15:54.869
see if we get a hit on
facial rec of our bald friend.

15:54.903 --> 15:57.038
If not, get the picture out
on the streets.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.706
I want to find this son of a bitch.

15:58.741 --> 16:00.208
Hey, so I just talked
to Robbery-Homicide.

16:00.242 --> 16:02.010
There's a ring of Eastern European women

16:02.044 --> 16:03.344
that have been active
in the Viagra Triangle

16:03.379 --> 16:04.679
over the last six months.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.381
Yeah, my pimp CI said the same thing.

16:06.415 --> 16:08.216
But they're not hookers.
They're identity thieves.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.151
They target wealthy men
in high-end hotels.

16:10.185 --> 16:12.053
Drug them, clone their
credit cards, steal watches,

16:12.087 --> 16:13.855
loose cash, whatever they can grab.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.623
The scam is run by the Odessa mob.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.025
That makes sense.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.626
Sasha and her friend were recruited

16:18.661 --> 16:20.628
from a village not far from there.

16:20.663 --> 16:22.397
Hey, you run Graynor's credit cards yet?

16:22.431 --> 16:23.865
Yeah.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.366
All four were maxed out,

16:25.401 --> 16:27.568
and starting yesterday, all the charges

16:27.603 --> 16:30.138
originated in Eastern Europe.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.045
Free to go, Scott.

16:37.079 --> 16:41.149
- You found the killer?
- We got a few solid leads.

16:41.183 --> 16:43.051
We do know you're not responsible

16:43.085 --> 16:45.553
for what happened to that young lady.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.088
I appreciate you saying that out loud.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.257
I still can't believe
this really happened.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.758
Listen, I want you to go out this way.

16:50.793 --> 16:52.360
It leads to a back alley.

16:52.394 --> 16:55.596
I called your lawyer.
He's waiting for you.

16:55.631 --> 16:57.598
So no one knows about any of this?

16:57.633 --> 17:00.368
No.

17:00.402 --> 17:02.904
I appreciate that, Hank.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.339
Man of his word.

17:05.374 --> 17:07.608
Rare commodity.

17:07.643 --> 17:11.145
In my business anyway.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.717
Thank you. So what's going on?

17:15.751 --> 17:17.551
It sounded important.

17:17.586 --> 17:19.587
Are you breaking up
with me at the coffee cart?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.455
I wouldn't break up
with you at a coffee cart.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.424
Come on, I'm too classy for that.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.194
Uh, no, there's a case we're
investigating that I think

17:26.228 --> 17:28.529
might intersect
with the one you're working on.

17:28.564 --> 17:31.032
I ran it through facial
recognition, didn't get a hit.

17:31.066 --> 17:32.734
I'm thinking you might
recognize the guy.

17:32.768 --> 17:34.268
- What's the case?
- Homicide.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.470
Young Ukrainian woman.

17:35.504 --> 17:36.804
This guy's our prime suspect.

17:36.839 --> 17:37.805
And we think that he's connected

17:37.840 --> 17:40.074
to the Odessa mob.

17:40.109 --> 17:42.577
Right.

17:42.611 --> 17:45.813
Hey. Do you know who he is?

17:45.848 --> 17:47.982
- I can't answer that.
- Why not?

17:48.016 --> 17:50.752
All I can say right now is
he's a person of interest

17:50.786 --> 17:52.653
in the case we're investigating.

17:52.688 --> 17:54.222
Yeah, us too, and it's a murder

17:54.256 --> 17:55.823
so I'm pretty sure that we win.

17:55.858 --> 17:58.426
Yeah, it's not that simple.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.396
Okay, uh, I need to talk to
a few people about this,

18:01.430 --> 18:03.831
and you should talk to Voight.

18:03.866 --> 18:05.299
I think we should all sit down

18:05.334 --> 18:07.068
and figure out the best way
to move forward.

18:07.102 --> 18:08.770
We're on the same team, right?

18:08.804 --> 18:10.405
- If you know who this guy is...
- Kim.

18:10.439 --> 18:13.007
It's important, please.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.976
Just talk to Voight, okay?

18:15.010 --> 18:18.346
I'm gonna set up a meeting.
We'll go from there.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.748
Hey, would you just trust me?

18:20.783 --> 18:23.251
I'm protecting both of us, okay?

18:23.285 --> 18:27.855
Got it.

18:27.890 --> 18:31.025
I'll call you later, okay?

18:35.063 --> 18:37.532
You talked to your boyfriend
about our case?

18:37.566 --> 18:39.934
Well, Matt is investigating
the Odessa mob.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.135
They're building the RICO case.

18:41.170 --> 18:42.770
So I thought he might be able

18:42.805 --> 18:44.705
to identify the suspect in our homicide.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.942
Let me guess... he couldn't.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.310
No, he thought that we should meet

18:49.344 --> 18:50.711
and discuss the best way to proceed.

18:50.746 --> 18:52.146
I was trying to help, Sergeant.

18:52.181 --> 18:53.714
We needed the name of the shooter.

18:53.749 --> 18:55.183
I thought he might know, and so yes,

18:55.217 --> 18:56.884
- I told him about our case.
- Look, Kim.

18:56.919 --> 18:59.053
I could give a damn who you sleep with,

18:59.087 --> 19:00.688
but I care a whole hell of a lot

19:00.722 --> 19:03.057
who you share our information with.

19:03.091 --> 19:04.525
I thought he could help us.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.696
The Feds help the Feds.
That's it, end of story.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.131
Come in.

19:10.165 --> 19:12.066
- I got something.
- What is it?

19:12.100 --> 19:14.235
Been looking at surveillance
video from the past month.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.070
Found footage of Sasha and the bald guy,

19:16.104 --> 19:17.638
the shooter from the bar.

19:17.673 --> 19:19.073
And I just found a shot of him

19:19.107 --> 19:21.342
with our good friend, Luke Ivey.

19:21.376 --> 19:22.677
Security guy.

19:22.711 --> 19:24.412
That pothead was lying to us.

19:24.446 --> 19:28.015
Get his ass in here. Now.

19:28.050 --> 19:30.952
- All right.
- Okay.

19:37.459 --> 19:39.560
We got an open door.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.398
Hey, Luke.

19:44.433 --> 19:48.002
Luke.

19:48.036 --> 19:51.772
Luke. Where you at, man?

19:51.807 --> 19:54.041
Hey. Hey, Chicago PD.

19:54.076 --> 19:57.745
Get your hands up.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.481
Hey, Luke.

20:03.652 --> 20:05.853
Son of a bitch.

20:08.924 --> 20:11.592
I'll go call it in.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.499
Damn it.

20:16.156 --> 20:18.690
Ivey took one right to the
back of the head, close range.

20:18.724 --> 20:20.258
Any sign of a break-in?

20:20.292 --> 20:22.390
No, sir. No struggle.
Straight execution.

20:22.428 --> 20:23.561
I spoke to a neighbor.

20:23.586 --> 20:24.797
She said she heard a gunshot.

20:24.843 --> 20:26.621
Looked out the window,
saw a white, bald guy

20:26.656 --> 20:27.922
get into a black Mercedes.

20:27.957 --> 20:29.658
She couldn't get the plates though.

20:29.692 --> 20:31.326
You show her the surveillance photo?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.561
Yeah, she says she's
pretty positive it was him.

20:33.596 --> 20:35.063
So our guy gets nervous.

20:35.097 --> 20:38.433
Dumps his inside man
at the hotel. Makes sense.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.268
Burgess.

20:40.303 --> 20:42.337
I got a meeting with the FBI.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.571
The Feds helping us out?

20:43.606 --> 20:44.893
I said I had a meeting.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.809
I didn't say anything
about getting any help.

20:50.112 --> 20:53.181
Like I told Kim, given
the potential conflicts here,

20:53.215 --> 20:55.917
it makes sense for all of us
to get on the same page.

20:55.951 --> 20:57.585
So, from my understanding, Sergeant,

20:57.620 --> 20:59.154
your Unit is investigating a homicide

20:59.188 --> 21:01.089
that may be connected to the Odessa mob.

21:01.123 --> 21:04.259
Actually, it's two homicides,
but Kim was just speculating.

21:04.293 --> 21:06.828
We don't have any evidence
connecting him to this group.

21:06.862 --> 21:09.464
We do. I recognized
the photo Kim showed me.

21:09.498 --> 21:12.167
He's a low level player, runs
their cyber-fraud division.

21:12.201 --> 21:14.135
That's great. Just give me his name.

21:14.170 --> 21:17.272
We'll scoop him up.
Save you the trouble.

21:17.306 --> 21:19.941
Well, you said yourself,
he's just a low-level punk.

21:19.975 --> 21:21.443
We can't reveal that information.

21:21.477 --> 21:23.144
Not at this point in time.

21:23.179 --> 21:25.213
We've been investigating
these pricks for two years.

21:25.247 --> 21:27.015
We're this close to taking down
the whole damn organization.

21:27.049 --> 21:28.783
And we don't want to spook anyone.

21:28.818 --> 21:30.218
We need them to think
everything's normal.

21:30.252 --> 21:32.020
Look, we get it. You've been working

21:32.054 --> 21:33.488
- this a long time...
- But when the case is over

21:33.522 --> 21:34.723
we'll give you everything you need

21:34.757 --> 21:35.890
to nail this son of a bitch.

21:35.925 --> 21:37.158
I give you my word on that.

21:37.193 --> 21:38.526
The thing is, guys,

21:38.561 --> 21:40.962
I got a dead girl, 18 years old.

21:40.996 --> 21:42.664
And I highly doubt her mother

21:42.698 --> 21:44.566
gives a damn about your RICO case.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.235
I get it, I get it. I really do.

21:47.269 --> 21:48.837
But like I said before,

21:48.871 --> 21:50.372
we can't let a local case

21:50.406 --> 21:52.173
interfere with this investigation.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.708
You asking me to sit on my hands?

21:53.743 --> 21:56.745
Yes. Just for the time being.

22:00.015 --> 22:01.182
Okay, you win.

22:01.217 --> 22:03.017
Thank you for being so understanding.

22:03.052 --> 22:04.986
- Yeah.
- We appreciate it.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.255
Mm-hmm.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.561
All right, the good news is, we now know

22:13.596 --> 22:15.764
our suspect is part of the Odessa mob.

22:15.798 --> 22:19.834
Call Antonio, get boots on the
ground in Ukrainian Village.

22:19.869 --> 22:23.037
Circulate the photo of Sasha
and that male suspect.

22:23.072 --> 22:24.706
Believe me, someone's gonna know so...

22:24.740 --> 22:26.541
Wait, you just said
we were gonna stand down

22:26.575 --> 22:28.410
- until they made their case.
- Listen, Kim, you got a chance

22:28.444 --> 22:30.879
to make a murder case,
you make it; you don't wait.

22:30.913 --> 22:32.714
So the investigation is still on?

22:32.748 --> 22:35.183
We're gonna pretend like
that meeting didn't happen?

22:38.587 --> 22:41.122
Is that a problem?

22:41.157 --> 22:43.358
- No.
- So keep your mouth shut

22:43.392 --> 22:44.692
around Matt, you hear me?

22:44.727 --> 22:47.028
- Not a word.
- Yeah, I hear you.

22:47.062 --> 22:48.696
All right, head over to the hospital,

22:48.731 --> 22:50.064
show Irina that surveillance video.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.767
Maybe she can ID her daughter's friend.

22:57.106 --> 23:01.476
Um, do you mind taking a look at this?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.044
I got it.

23:03.078 --> 23:06.748
It's from the night
that Sasha was killed.

23:14.356 --> 23:17.058
She was so beautiful.

23:17.092 --> 23:19.928
I'm sorry to make you watch it.

23:19.962 --> 23:21.396
Um...

23:21.430 --> 23:24.933
You told Sergeant Voight

23:24.967 --> 23:27.101
that Sasha came to Chicago
with a friend.

23:27.136 --> 23:29.571
Yes, Olene Zelenko.

23:29.605 --> 23:31.072
Olene.

23:31.106 --> 23:34.375
Do you see Olene anywhere in this video?

23:35.277 --> 23:37.779
- There, that's Olene.
- Okay.

23:37.813 --> 23:41.015
Thank you. That's very helpful.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.817
Are you going to rescue her?

23:42.852 --> 23:44.619
We're gonna try.

23:44.653 --> 23:47.088
We're gonna show this photo
to people who work at hotels.

23:47.122 --> 23:49.991
Hopefully, someone's seen her,
can help us find her.

23:50.025 --> 23:52.760
And then once we find Olene,
hopefully she can help us

23:52.795 --> 23:54.963
find the man that killed Sasha.

23:54.997 --> 23:58.800
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:00.035 --> 24:02.637
Her name's Olene Zelenko.

24:02.671 --> 24:05.306
She's being held captive
by the Odessa mob.

24:05.341 --> 24:08.543
She's doing ID thefts
at various high-end hotels

24:08.577 --> 24:11.980
on the Gold Coast so let's
get these photos out there.

24:12.014 --> 24:14.282
Now.

24:14.316 --> 24:15.884
Thanks, Trudy.

24:15.918 --> 24:18.186
No problem. Hey, um...

24:18.220 --> 24:22.824
I heard about your issue
with your new beau.

24:22.858 --> 24:24.959
Oh, it's not an issue.

24:24.994 --> 24:29.564
Right, good.
'Cause you should be careful.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.032
What's that supposed to mean?

24:31.066 --> 24:33.468
It means things get complicated.

24:33.502 --> 24:35.169
We do the same job as the Feds,

24:35.204 --> 24:37.138
but we are not on the same team.

24:37.172 --> 24:39.474
So if you really like this guy,

24:39.508 --> 24:42.644
- you might want to step away.
- Step away from what?

24:42.678 --> 24:45.313
The case.

24:45.347 --> 24:46.881
No.

24:46.916 --> 24:50.318
I'm good, but thanks.

24:50.352 --> 24:52.387
Okay.

24:53.389 --> 24:58.826
So, the word is you've moved
off my favorite congressman.

24:58.861 --> 25:02.597
You're even more connected
than I thought.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.532
Here's the problem, Hank.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.067
My developer friends have told me

25:06.101 --> 25:08.202
they're still interested
in the West Side project.

25:08.237 --> 25:12.607
But the problem is
we need Graynor on board.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.242
- Then talk to him.
- Yeah.

25:14.276 --> 25:18.012
- Right here.
- I have about 20 times.

25:18.047 --> 25:20.448
The man just doesn't believe in it.

25:20.482 --> 25:22.083
He's entitled to his opinion.

25:22.117 --> 25:25.019
Not when it's bad for
business... my business.

25:25.054 --> 25:26.754
Look, you two don't see eye to eye.

25:26.789 --> 25:28.056
It's got nothing to do with me.

25:28.090 --> 25:31.259
Sure it does.

25:31.293 --> 25:33.361
How's that?

25:36.065 --> 25:39.067
You owe me a favor.

25:39.101 --> 25:41.469
I kept my mouth shut
about that Irish cop.

25:41.503 --> 25:43.104
McGrady. You remember him?

25:43.138 --> 25:44.105
I do.

25:44.139 --> 25:46.541
Framed that young brother
for his own suicide.

25:46.575 --> 25:49.811
Hell of a thing.

25:49.845 --> 25:51.446
Don't worry, Hank.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.880
I didn't say a word.

25:52.915 --> 25:55.216
I just sat there and watched.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.552
All you boys in blue saluting his ass,

25:57.586 --> 25:59.954
treating him like some damn hero.

25:59.989 --> 26:01.389
What's the ask?

26:01.423 --> 26:02.957
I want a picture.

26:02.992 --> 26:04.392
What picture?

26:04.426 --> 26:06.794
The crime scene photo.

26:06.829 --> 26:08.930
Of Graynor and the dead girl.

26:08.964 --> 26:10.398
I already told you, he's innocent.

26:10.432 --> 26:12.400
Yeah, of murder, but he was still there.

26:12.434 --> 26:14.435
He was a mark.

26:14.470 --> 26:15.903
Who gives a damn?

26:15.938 --> 26:18.306
The public sees that picture
of a dead hooker

26:18.340 --> 26:20.008
in his hotel room, hell.

26:20.042 --> 26:22.910
The damn Pope couldn't
get out from under that.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.745
It was good to see you, Ray.

26:33.664 --> 26:35.757
Price wants to see crime scene photos.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.571
Yeah, so he can blow up Graynor.

26:38.057 --> 26:39.357
Wants to build some sort

26:39.392 --> 26:41.526
of fancy office project in his ward.

26:41.561 --> 26:45.191
- Just tell him to go to hell.
- I wish I could.

26:46.632 --> 26:47.995
I didn't know he had a marker.

26:48.066 --> 26:50.363
Yeah, it's a pretty good one.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.871
I like Graynor.

26:52.998 --> 26:55.466
Yeah, so do I. Straight shooter.

26:55.551 --> 26:58.319
Supports the police. I like him, too.

26:58.354 --> 27:01.022
Maybe, uh, Price is bluffing?

27:01.056 --> 27:03.658
Maybe, it's possible, but...

27:03.692 --> 27:06.327
If he's not, he can do a lot of damage.

27:06.362 --> 27:07.862
He may ruin a few careers.

27:07.896 --> 27:09.964
Hey, just got off the phone

27:09.999 --> 27:11.699
with the manager at the Langston hotel.

27:11.734 --> 27:13.434
He said he just saw Olene
get into an elevator

27:13.469 --> 27:14.836
with a middle-aged businessman.

27:14.870 --> 27:16.371
- Sound credible?
- Yeah.

27:16.405 --> 27:18.306
He said she has an accent
and has the same dress

27:18.340 --> 27:20.008
Olene was wearing
in the picture we sent over.

27:20.042 --> 27:21.943
All right, grab Antonio. Check it out.

27:21.977 --> 27:23.945
Okay.

27:27.916 --> 27:30.551
She showed up about an hour
ago with two other girls.

27:30.586 --> 27:32.954
A man was there too, watching.

27:32.988 --> 27:34.222
Is it him?

27:34.256 --> 27:35.823
No, somebody else.

27:35.858 --> 27:37.325
This guy had way more hair.

27:37.359 --> 27:38.559
When did she come up here?

27:38.594 --> 27:40.728
Mm, about 20 minutes ago.

27:40.763 --> 27:44.565
- Room 2603.
- Great. Thanks.

27:46.502 --> 27:48.069
Olene Zelenko. Chicago PD.

27:48.103 --> 27:50.038
Please, don't arrest me.
They make me do this.

27:50.072 --> 27:51.906
No, no, no. It's okay.
Hey, we're here to help.

27:51.940 --> 27:53.808
Thank you. Thank God.

27:53.842 --> 27:55.510
He's out cold.

27:55.544 --> 27:58.413
He took our passports.
We have to do what he says.

27:58.447 --> 28:00.048
Bring him money.

28:00.082 --> 28:02.250
Do you know who this man is?

28:02.284 --> 28:04.919
Yes. But I can't say anything.

28:04.953 --> 28:07.255
He will hurt my family.
He tells us that all the time.

28:07.289 --> 28:10.258
What's his name, Olene?

28:10.292 --> 28:16.197
Tell us his name, and he won't
hurt another soul, I promise.

28:16.231 --> 28:17.865
Yuri.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.768
Yuri Remnoff. He's a monster.

28:23.472 --> 28:24.906
So tell me.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.674
I give you his name,
so what happens now?

28:26.708 --> 28:28.109
I just want to go home.

28:28.143 --> 28:30.845
We know, and we're gonna help you.

28:30.879 --> 28:32.880
We need to leave. Now.

28:32.915 --> 28:34.782
The man who watches me, Alex,
he will be here very soon

28:34.817 --> 28:36.551
- to check on me.
- Okay, we need to find Yuri

28:36.585 --> 28:39.353
and all the other girls
that are working for him too.

28:39.388 --> 28:41.022
But we need your help.

28:41.056 --> 28:42.924
If you give me a gun, I will shoot him.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.592
- No, no.
- I know how you feel.

28:44.626 --> 28:46.561
- But that's not what we meant.
- He deserves to die

28:46.595 --> 28:48.196
for what he did to Sasha.

28:48.230 --> 28:49.530
To all of us.

28:49.565 --> 28:51.132
We just need to know where he is.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.633
I don't know.

28:52.668 --> 28:54.068
Alex, he takes us to Yuri

28:54.103 --> 28:55.803
whenever we get
the credit card information.

28:55.838 --> 28:57.238
Where's that?

28:57.272 --> 28:59.474
The location changes all the time.

28:59.508 --> 29:01.542
He keeps moving.

29:01.577 --> 29:04.378
So, you'll see Yuri tonight?

29:04.413 --> 29:06.481
Yes.

29:06.515 --> 29:08.149
If you're okay with this,

29:08.183 --> 29:09.617
take the credit cards,
meet up with Alex,

29:09.651 --> 29:10.818
like everything is normal.

29:10.853 --> 29:12.487
You want me to go back there

29:12.521 --> 29:14.822
- with those horrible men? No.
- We'll be following you.

29:14.857 --> 29:16.290
We're gonna be there the whole time.

29:16.325 --> 29:18.826
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

29:35.811 --> 29:38.312
Let's go, ladies.

29:38.347 --> 29:40.848
- Don't touch me.
- Relax, pretty girl.

29:40.883 --> 29:42.950
Quicker we get this done,
quicker you're home.

29:42.985 --> 29:44.352
<i>Pospishay.</i>

29:44.386 --> 29:45.853
They're walking towards the front door.

29:45.888 --> 29:48.656
All right, copy.

29:48.690 --> 29:50.925
How's your Ukrainian?

29:50.959 --> 29:53.761
I can barely speak English.

29:55.164 --> 29:57.331
What about Olene and the girls?

29:57.366 --> 29:58.766
Where's Yuri?

29:58.800 --> 30:00.434
- He's not coming.
- Why?

30:00.469 --> 30:02.703
He's hiding.
The police are looking for him.

30:02.738 --> 30:04.305
So he told me to come instead.

30:04.339 --> 30:07.250
Back in the car.

30:08.577 --> 30:11.045
Sounds like Yuri got the heads-up.

30:11.079 --> 30:13.214
From the Feds, no doubt.

30:13.248 --> 30:17.051
What do we do?

30:17.085 --> 30:18.686
All right, everybody listen up.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.054
<i>Stand down.</i>

30:20.088 --> 30:21.689
What about Olene and the girls?

30:21.723 --> 30:23.491
<i>Keep her in play for now.</i>

30:23.525 --> 30:24.792
Sarge, they're scared.

30:24.826 --> 30:26.694
<i>Just stay with the driver.</i>

30:26.728 --> 30:30.298
<i>You and Antonio hold the main
eye, find their location.</i>

30:30.332 --> 30:33.634
But unless she's in danger, we
are not moving in, understand?

30:33.669 --> 30:36.804
Yeah, copy that.

30:36.838 --> 30:39.073
You good with this?

30:39.107 --> 30:40.675
No.

30:40.709 --> 30:44.378
But it's the right move if
we want to find Yuri anyway.

30:49.911 --> 30:52.854
- So we lost him?
- Yeah, he's in the damn wind somewhere.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.257
- Burgess, come on in here.
- What happened?

30:56.291 --> 30:58.092
I thought Yuri was supposed
to meet up with the girls

30:58.126 --> 30:59.427
after they got the credit cards.

30:59.461 --> 31:01.162
What happen is the FBI

31:01.196 --> 31:03.097
- and you boyfriend screwed us.
- What?

31:03.131 --> 31:04.899
- They tipped Yuri off.
- How do you know that?

31:04.933 --> 31:07.368
Because I know.

31:07.402 --> 31:09.270
<i>I have been spelling it out for you,</i>

31:09.304 --> 31:11.706
but you still don't get it, do you?

31:11.740 --> 31:15.009
The Feds don't care about
our humble little murder case.

31:15.043 --> 31:17.445
Not even a little. They never will.

31:17.479 --> 31:19.780
I mean, all that talk about
helping us down the road,

31:19.815 --> 31:23.084
it's crap. It's never gonna happen.

31:23.118 --> 31:26.120
They're gonna flip Yuri
to help their own case.

31:26.154 --> 31:28.022
He'll get five years. If that.

31:28.056 --> 31:30.424
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

31:30.459 --> 31:32.526
Like I said before,
I was trying to help us...

31:32.561 --> 31:34.795
I know that, I know. And you still can.

31:34.830 --> 31:36.397
As a matter of fact, right now

31:36.431 --> 31:39.467
you're the only person
who can fix this mess.

31:39.501 --> 31:41.068
But I need to know.

31:41.103 --> 31:45.039
Are you with us or them?

31:47.009 --> 31:49.610
I'm with you.

31:49.645 --> 31:53.080
Just, you tell me what you need
me to do, and I'll do it.

31:53.115 --> 31:55.249
Right answer.

32:05.893 --> 32:07.294
Hey.

32:07.336 --> 32:09.537
- Hey.
- Hey, everything all right?

32:09.574 --> 32:11.908
Voight was coming down
on you pretty hard last night.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.585
Yeah, I'm good.

32:13.619 --> 32:14.919
You sure?

32:14.954 --> 32:16.908
Yeah.

32:17.423 --> 32:18.423
Kim.

32:18.457 --> 32:21.518
It's me. Tell me what's going on.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.883
Adam, this is case is falling
apart, and it's my fault.

32:25.915 --> 32:28.407
- That's not true.
- It is. It's my fault.

32:28.559 --> 32:31.649
- So now I have to, um...
- What?

32:31.929 --> 32:34.703
I have to sell out
my relationship with Matt.

32:35.599 --> 32:37.734
I know that this isn't something

32:37.768 --> 32:40.370
you want to hear but...

32:40.404 --> 32:43.706
I like the guy a lot.

32:43.741 --> 32:47.010
Let me guess, Voight
wants you to pick us or him.

32:47.044 --> 32:50.013
Yeah. I mean, something like that, yeah.

32:50.047 --> 32:55.184
This unit, we're family,
plain and simple.

32:55.219 --> 32:56.519
Life gets in the way,

32:56.554 --> 32:59.055
makes things a little more complicated.

32:59.089 --> 33:00.557
Yeah.

33:00.591 --> 33:02.492
I guess what I'm saying is sometimes

33:02.526 --> 33:04.160
you got nothing but bad choices.

33:04.194 --> 33:07.864
No matter what you do,
you're going to hate yourself.

33:11.402 --> 33:13.436
Kim.

33:13.470 --> 33:14.704
Bottom line is you are one

33:14.738 --> 33:16.439
of the best people I've ever known.

33:16.473 --> 33:18.408
So you do what you think is right.

33:18.442 --> 33:21.244
And that will be good enough.

33:21.278 --> 33:24.113
- All right?
- Okay.

33:24.148 --> 33:26.716
Thanks.

33:34.458 --> 33:36.626
So what's going on?

33:36.660 --> 33:39.228
I don't even know how
to talk about this.

33:39.263 --> 33:43.299
It's okay, just say it.

33:43.334 --> 33:46.636
My boss, Voight, he doesn't
play well with others.

33:46.670 --> 33:48.538
Yeah, I, um... I kind of sensed that.

33:48.572 --> 33:49.806
And he doesn't think
that you're going to

33:49.840 --> 33:51.641
help us find our murder suspect.

33:51.675 --> 33:53.276
He thinks you're going to flip him,

33:53.310 --> 33:56.746
use him as a cooperating
witness in your RICO case.

33:56.780 --> 33:59.315
What are you really saying here?

33:59.350 --> 34:02.085
He wants us to start
hitting doors, making arrests.

34:02.119 --> 34:04.420
Arrests? Like who?

34:04.455 --> 34:06.756
We've been surveilling
the girls and the bodyguards.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.157
We have their names and addresses.

34:08.192 --> 34:09.993
And we figured we'd start there,

34:10.027 --> 34:13.295
see if we can figure out
who the shot callers are.

34:13.330 --> 34:15.331
All right, well then,
obviously, that's not

34:15.366 --> 34:16.599
what we discussed the other day.

34:16.634 --> 34:20.670
I know. That's why I'm here.

34:20.704 --> 34:22.505
Well, I appreciate you telling me.

34:22.539 --> 34:23.906
I know it couldn't
have been easy for you.

34:23.940 --> 34:27.476
You're right. It wasn't.

34:27.511 --> 34:31.481
Hey, you did the right thing. Thank you.

34:31.514 --> 34:34.250
Yeah.

34:34.284 --> 34:35.685
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

34:35.719 --> 34:37.654
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:43.460 --> 34:47.196
Burgess is a pro.
The guy doesn't have a clue.

34:52.636 --> 34:54.170
All right, bingo.

34:54.204 --> 34:56.672
Ol' Matty is dialing up a storm.

34:59.309 --> 35:01.210
Okay, we got lucky, guys.

35:01.245 --> 35:02.879
Traced a series of calls.

35:02.913 --> 35:05.348
Found our boy Yuri's hideout.

35:05.382 --> 35:07.383
He's holed up at 4821 Briscoe.

35:07.418 --> 35:09.719
It's a small house,
looks like he's there alone.

35:09.753 --> 35:11.354
Upton, Halstead, stake out

35:11.388 --> 35:13.556
the flophouse where the girls
are being held.

35:13.590 --> 35:15.391
We get word we got Yuri, move in.

35:15.426 --> 35:17.193
Get Olene and the other girls
out of there.

35:17.227 --> 35:19.629
- Bust everyone else.
- Copy that.

35:19.663 --> 35:22.298
- All right, let's vest up.
- Hey.

35:22.332 --> 35:26.035
I see you made your choice.

35:26.070 --> 35:29.672
Yeah, now I just got to live with it.

35:29.707 --> 35:31.574
I lied to his face, Adam.

35:31.608 --> 35:34.711
I played him like a fool,
and for good measure, I just...

35:34.745 --> 35:37.914
blew up the biggest case of his career.

35:37.948 --> 35:40.483
- My God, I screwed him.
- You didn't screw him.

35:40.517 --> 35:43.252
Nah, you made a choice.

35:43.287 --> 35:46.089
You made the right choice.

35:46.123 --> 35:47.824
Yeah.

36:00.237 --> 36:01.404
Okay?

36:01.438 --> 36:03.906
- Yeah.
- Chicago PD!

36:04.975 --> 36:06.175
You all right? Kim?

36:06.210 --> 36:07.210
Yeah, I'm good.

36:07.244 --> 36:09.245
He's on the move!

36:09.279 --> 36:12.348
5021 Ida Ten One.
Shots fired at the police.

36:12.382 --> 36:14.283
Offender fleeing eastbound
on the south alley.

36:14.318 --> 36:16.119
<i>Copy that, 5021 Ida.</i>

36:19.623 --> 36:21.858
- You good?
- I'm good, good. Go!

36:25.496 --> 36:27.697
Go.

36:54.091 --> 36:56.025
Move!

36:57.694 --> 37:00.062
Move.

37:02.199 --> 37:06.169
Get out of the way! Move!

37:08.806 --> 37:12.775
- Move!
- Chicago PD!

37:12.810 --> 37:14.777
Move, get out of the way.

37:14.812 --> 37:17.747
- Move!
- Police!

37:22.486 --> 37:24.620
Nice work.

37:24.655 --> 37:26.856
Hey!

37:26.890 --> 37:30.660
Yuri Remnoff. You're under arrest, pal.

37:30.694 --> 37:33.763
Good job.

37:33.797 --> 37:36.232
That's what I'm talking about.

37:37.701 --> 37:39.335
So you arrested him?

37:39.369 --> 37:41.470
Are you kidding me?
We just had this conversation.

37:41.505 --> 37:45.308
Well, it wasn't much
of a conversation, Brian.

37:45.342 --> 37:46.609
Excuse me?

37:46.643 --> 37:48.544
Seemed to me more of a speech.

37:48.579 --> 37:51.280
You told me what you needed,
why you needed it...

37:51.315 --> 37:53.449
Are you trying to pick
a fight with the FBI?

37:53.483 --> 37:55.351
Have you lost your damn mind?
Are you stupid?

37:55.385 --> 37:57.320
We had reason to believe
a murder suspect

37:57.354 --> 37:59.622
was gonna flee the country
so we moved in.

37:59.656 --> 38:01.290
- I'm sorry that...
- You're sorry?

38:01.325 --> 38:02.658
That's all you got?

38:02.693 --> 38:04.460
You jeopardized a two year investigation

38:04.494 --> 38:09.232
- over some Ukrainian hooker...
- Hey, watch yourself, Brian.

38:09.266 --> 38:13.035
It's never a good idea
to speak ill of the dead.

38:14.104 --> 38:16.906
She was 18 years old,
being held hostage...

38:16.940 --> 38:19.475
I don't care if she was
a saint; she is one person.

38:19.509 --> 38:21.244
The case that we're chasing...

38:21.278 --> 38:22.845
We're talking hundreds...

38:22.880 --> 38:24.680
Thousands of lives at stake.

38:24.715 --> 38:26.582
Hold on a second.

38:26.617 --> 38:29.151
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Brian?

38:39.196 --> 38:40.997
Hello?

38:52.910 --> 38:55.611
You sure about this?

38:55.646 --> 39:00.449
I am.

39:00.484 --> 39:02.518
I like you, Hank.

39:02.552 --> 39:05.888
But please, don't make me
play hard ball on this.

39:13.497 --> 39:14.730
Is that a threat?

39:14.765 --> 39:16.732
Oh, come on, Hank.

39:16.767 --> 39:19.468
You and I are friends.

39:19.503 --> 39:21.070
I'd never threaten you.

39:21.104 --> 39:23.472
But I do intend to cash in
on that favor.

39:23.507 --> 39:27.944
- Now you and me, we had a deal.
- I know.

39:27.978 --> 39:30.746
- I intend to honor it.
- Good.

39:30.781 --> 39:33.649
But we're not friends.

39:33.684 --> 39:36.819
Not after this.

39:36.853 --> 39:38.321
These are the crime scene photos?

39:38.355 --> 39:39.422
We're even.

39:39.456 --> 39:41.157
I'm not sure why you're so upset.

39:41.191 --> 39:42.959
This is no different
than any other deal we've made.

39:42.993 --> 39:45.728
- Oh, sure it is.
- How's that?

39:45.762 --> 39:50.333
Those other deals...

39:50.367 --> 39:54.370
The people we blew up were criminals.

39:58.008 --> 40:00.309
If it was easy, Hank,

40:00.344 --> 40:02.845
it wouldn't be called a favor.

40:49.026 --> 40:50.893
Hey.

40:50.927 --> 40:53.095
Can I come in?

40:56.424 --> 41:00.160
Matt, please, just let me explain, okay?
