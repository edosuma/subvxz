18:20.360 --> 18:21.720
Brett, do you wanna check the kegs?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.200
Sorry, I didn't...
No, it's all good.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.800
I just need you to check
the kegs for the...

18:24.840 --> 18:26.640
Cool, cool.
Thanks, OK.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.280
Oh! Is he single?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.520
Hey, Fi, I don't know

18:31.560 --> 18:33.880
if you've been, like,
totally honest with me.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.200
Like I just don't feel
like you're taking this seriously,

18:38.240 --> 18:40.840
and we are really trying
to get your business.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.560
Oh, fuck. Oh!

18:44.680 --> 18:47.720
Chi-Chi, I don't know
anything about beers, OK?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.720
But like Ross does everything I say,

18:49.760 --> 18:52.720
so just tell me
which ones to buy and he'll do it,

18:52.760 --> 18:53.920
(SNAPS) like that.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.400
Are you serious?
Yes.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.920
Oh, my...

18:58.960 --> 19:00.000
Do you mind signing
just here to say that?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.160
Do you mind signing
just here to say that?

19:02.200 --> 19:03.240
Oh.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.880
Was this like a...purely
a business thing,

19:07.920 --> 19:11.160
like inviting me here
because I work for an airline?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.360
Because I'm, you know,
like a high-flyer?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
No.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.640
Because I thought

19:16.680 --> 19:18.240
that you actually
wanted to hang out.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.520
Absolutely! Yes!
Like properly hang out.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.160
Absolutely! Of course I do.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.840
Yes, Fi-Fi.
'Cause I tell you what.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.720
I don't actually
have any friends left,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.120
because I had
a really shitty divorce, OK?

19:31.160 --> 19:34.440
It was really shitty,
and Michelle's gone.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.960
Doesn't even fuckin' text me
and I just thought we...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Forget it, just forget it.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
When you text...

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
Hey.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.280
No, no, no, when you text,

19:41.320 --> 19:42.840
I got a bit of a lift,
and that was stupid.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.760
Hey, me too. Seeing you.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
Honestly.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.880

Really?

19:50.920 --> 19:52.760

what?

19:52.800 --> 19:53.920
OK.
Come on.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.880
Alright. Awesome.
You know what I'm gonna do?

19:55.920 --> 19:57.920
Wait a sec, I've had an idea.
Yes!

19:57.960 --> 20:00.000

get her to meet us all out...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Bloody well text Juzzy,
get her to meet us all out...

20:01.040 --> 20:02.160
It's a plan.
..with a bag.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.600
Do you wanna do that?
Like... (SNIFFS) Get out there?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.920
What about him? He's in it.
Ah, he's gotta work.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.920
Us. What are we gonna do?

20:08.960 --> 20:11.160

20:26.600 --> 20:28.400
Um, yeah. Sorry.

20:28.440 --> 20:32.520
It's a bit last minute but obviously
there's room for us now at Meggles'.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.040
You know, with Peggy dying, so...
Oh, right.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.120
Col and I can stay there.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.200
Oh.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.240
Wish I'd known.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.200
I wouldn't have got
such a good bottle of red.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.400
Is that Grange?
Yeah. It's 2014, but, yeah.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
Wow, are you celebrating?
Yeah.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.920
I mean, not really.
Mm?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.680
Just a day. Just a nice day.
Lucky day.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.720
Nice.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.040
Don't worry,
I can finish that all by myself.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.560
Perfectly capable.
OK.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.960
Hey, uh...

21:00.960 --> 21:03.080
You're not leaving
'cause of the other night, are you?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.160
No.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.200
Are you sure?
Oh.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.520
'Cause I just feel like
you might have been dodging me

21:07.560 --> 21:08.640
a little bit because of it.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.000
Dodging you today?
Little bit.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.360
Dude, I'm so busy.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.920
Totally.
Yeah. Um, no, it's all good.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
It's totally fine.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.160
I just... You know, I've got
a lot of uni on at the moment

21:19.200 --> 21:21.120
and, um, I gotta focus on that
and Meggles gets that,

21:21.160 --> 21:22.720
so I think it makes sense
that I just go there.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.760
Mm.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.160
And you did want me to move out.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.480
You asked me
to find somewhere to stay.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
Of course I did.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.320
It's just, uh, I didn't realise
you'd found a place,

21:29.360 --> 21:30.360
that's all, so...so soon.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400

21:31.440 --> 21:33.640
Uh, how are you
gonna look after Col, though?

21:33.680 --> 21:35.720
If you could still help me
with that, that would be awesome.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.800
Oh, OK.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.760
Yeah, if that's... I mean,
he's not too much of a burden.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.240
Well, I mean he is, but you know,
he's the sort of burden

21:41.280 --> 21:42.960
that gets right in there, you know.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.280
Yeah, he's a nice one.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.440
Anyway, I'm so shattered,
so I'm gonna go.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.920
Totally. I'll drive you.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.960
It's OK, I've got an Uber.
