WEBVTT

00:19.938 --> 00:21.064
Thanks.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.741
- No.

01:17.704 --> 01:19.831
--Hands up. Hands up!

01:19.914 --> 01:22.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.502
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.463
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

01:27.547 --> 01:28.673
How else do you think
I got in here?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.592
What's your name again?

01:31.676 --> 01:33.386
It's Jim Hopper.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.179
Chief Jim Hopper.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.140
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper--

01:38.599 --> 01:40.184
- Come again?

01:44.856 --> 01:46.441
Hey...

01:46.524 --> 01:48.026
you mind if I borrow this one?

01:59.037 --> 02:01.414
--Drink.

02:01.497 --> 02:02.790
It'll calm your nerves.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.127
Help you think straight, yeah?

02:10.882 --> 02:12.759
I don't know what to do.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.595
I know. I know.

02:17.013 --> 02:19.265
This whole time...

02:21.059 --> 02:24.604
I... I could... I could feel him.

02:24.687 --> 02:25.980
He was...

02:26.898 --> 02:29.067
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.903
- I knew he was alive.

02:31.986 --> 02:36.783
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.869
Now it's like I... uh...

02:41.412 --> 02:44.165
God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.294
-Don't look at me like that.
-Like what?

02:48.378 --> 02:50.421
Like how everybody is looking at me.

02:50.505 --> 02:52.423
-Like I'm out of my damn mind.
-Hey.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.386
You're not gonna like this,

02:56.469 --> 03:00.098
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

03:02.433 --> 03:03.476
It's in your head.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.980
-You remember your Aunt Darlene?
-No.

03:08.064 --> 03:11.025
No, this is not that.

03:11.109 --> 03:12.318
I mean, when something like this happens,

03:12.402 --> 03:15.446
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.950
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

03:19.033 --> 03:20.952
and you're saying his body is fake.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.496
He's in the wall.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.165
I mean, how do you explain that?

03:28.042 --> 03:30.586
--It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

03:30.670 --> 03:34.382
- At least go talk to a shrink or...

03:34.465 --> 03:37.510
-What about Pastor Charles or someone--
-I don't-- Well, they can't help.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.470
Joyce, you just told me...

03:40.388 --> 03:41.806
that Will is gone.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.853
- What else is there to do?

03:50.231 --> 03:51.399
Hey.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.165
Will?

04:08.458 --> 04:09.625
Will?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.296
Will?

04:15.298 --> 04:16.466
Will?

04:36.903 --> 04:39.280
What was Will saying?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.574
Like home... Like home...

04:42.992 --> 04:44.452
but dark?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.788
And empty.

04:48.039 --> 04:52.335
Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

04:52.418 --> 04:55.505
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.006
It's like riddles in the dark.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.966
Like home.
Like his house?

04:59.050 --> 05:00.301
Or maybe like Hawkins.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.928
Upside down.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.263
-What'd she say?
-Upside down.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.890
- What?
- Upside down.

05:06.891 --> 05:10.770
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

05:10.853 --> 05:12.814
Upside down.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.524
Dark. Empty.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.943
Do you understand what he's talking about?

05:17.026 --> 05:18.945
- No.
- Guys, come on, think about it.

05:19.028 --> 05:22.073
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

05:22.156 --> 05:23.950
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.743
But what if he was there?

05:25.827 --> 05:27.787
What if we just couldn't see him?

05:27.870 --> 05:29.831
What if he was on the other side?

05:31.040 --> 05:34.085
What if this is Hawkins and...

05:35.545 --> 05:36.754
this is where Will is?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.464
The Upside Down.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.258
Like the Vale of Shadows.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.636
Will?

05:44.929 --> 05:47.223
- Will?

05:50.434 --> 05:51.602
Will?

06:07.243 --> 06:09.287
I see him! Hey! Stop!

06:15.751 --> 06:17.253
"The Vale of Shadows

06:17.336 --> 06:21.591
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.641
It is a place of decay and death."

06:30.725 --> 06:32.059
Will?

06:32.143 --> 06:36.022
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.860
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

06:40.943 --> 06:43.321
--Will?

06:45.156 --> 06:46.490
Will?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.576
An alternate dimension.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.495
But... how... how do we get there?

06:51.579 --> 06:52.622
You cast Shadow Walk.

06:52.705 --> 06:53.998
In real life, dummy.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.083
We can't shadow walk, but...

06:57.043 --> 06:58.461
maybe she can.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.923
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

07:06.010 --> 07:07.678
Oh, my God!

07:22.151 --> 07:23.569
What the hell?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.197
Hey!

08:08.990 --> 08:10.282
Hey! Hey!

09:27.902 --> 09:29.528
Hey, kid.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.405
What's going on?

09:31.489 --> 09:35.576
- Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
- On the couch.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.703
Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

09:37.787 --> 09:39.580
How are you holding up?

09:43.167 --> 09:44.335
What happened?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.045
-Don't worry about that.
-Mom...

09:46.796 --> 09:49.757
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

09:49.840 --> 09:52.551
Jonathan, that's enough.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.055
Can we talk?

09:56.138 --> 09:57.306
Alone?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.351
-You need to leave.
-Look, I know you're upset.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.019
We all are.

10:02.103 --> 10:06.190
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.775
Yeah. Well, you being here,

10:07.858 --> 10:09.068
you're just making things worse,
like always.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.194
-Worse?
-Yeah!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.238
She took down that wall with an ax.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.406
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.991
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.827
This isn't some kind of joke.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.912
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.372
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.707
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

10:23.791 --> 10:24.959
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

10:25.042 --> 10:26.544
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.004
You hear me?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.385
Look, I'm on your side.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.761
I'm here to help.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.639
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.433
Thank God you're here.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.688
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.482
If not for me, for your mother.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.948
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.834
-Good.
-Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.628
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.797
Looks good.

11:11.881 --> 11:14.258
--Here we go.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.344
You look nice, sweetie.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.682
Anything else?

11:21.765 --> 11:23.642
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.561
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.938
I'm fine. Thanks.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.633
Ugh.

12:09.939 --> 12:12.232
Come on.
Time to go.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.947
- Come on.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.910
"Fear not,
for I am with you.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.663
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.624
I will strengthen you.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.876
Yes, I will help you.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.630
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

12:36.006 --> 12:39.093
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.721
How, if He is truly benevolent...

12:43.681 --> 12:47.059
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

12:48.394 --> 12:50.980
It would be easy to turn away from God...

12:52.064 --> 12:54.316
but we must remember that nothing,

12:54.400 --> 12:57.027
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

12:57.111 --> 13:00.114
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

13:00.197 --> 13:02.449
- and to surround Will and his family...

13:02.533 --> 13:05.869
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

13:16.005 --> 13:19.091
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.260
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

13:21.343 --> 13:23.387
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.640
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.226
Thanks for coming out.

13:40.029 --> 13:42.281
I see Will the Wise is back.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.910
What's that shooting out of his cane?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.412
Fireballs.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.789
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.915
Oh, well...

13:51.999 --> 13:55.044
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

13:55.127 --> 13:58.338
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

13:59.381 --> 14:01.050
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.428
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.512
You know?

14:06.055 --> 14:07.056
Yeah.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.099
So he needs the fireballs?

14:09.183 --> 14:11.977
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

14:12.061 --> 14:14.480
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

14:14.563 --> 14:16.982
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

14:17.066 --> 14:19.985
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.764
Will! Will, it's us!
Are you there?

16:12.848 --> 16:14.224
Can you hear us?
We're here!

16:14.308 --> 16:16.602
Hello? Mom?

16:16.685 --> 16:19.480
- Why can't he hear us?
- I don't know!

16:19.605 --> 16:21.899
Mom, it's coming!

16:23.275 --> 16:25.194
She was there.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.823
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

16:29.907 --> 16:32.367
-So, that's...
-Steve's house.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.995
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

16:35.078 --> 16:36.163
that's my house.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.124
-It's all so close.
-Yeah. Exactly.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.585
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.963
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.966
You want to go out there.

16:48.509 --> 16:49.843
We might not find anything.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.261
I found something.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.142
And if we do see it...

16:59.478 --> 17:01.230
then what?

17:04.608 --> 17:06.068
We kill it.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.365
-What are you doing?
-Just give me a second.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.542
Are you serious?

17:21.625 --> 17:26.004
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

17:28.549 --> 17:30.259
This is a terrible idea.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.886
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.889
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

17:35.973 --> 17:36.974
You know that.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.308
Your mom would.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.894
-She's been through enough.
-She deserves to know.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.354
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

17:42.437 --> 17:43.814
when this thing is dead.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.445
I don't know what in the world caused it.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.698
-Let's take a look, huh?
-Yeah.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.450
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

17:55.534 --> 17:56.577
Mr. Clarke?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.580
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.789
That right?

18:00.872 --> 18:04.251
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.871
Mr. Clarke?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.581
Oh, hey, there.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.791
How are you boys holding up?

18:46.585 --> 18:49.004
We're... in... mourning.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.840
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.217
We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

18:54.301 --> 18:57.471
-We have some questions.
-A lot of questions.

18:57.554 --> 19:00.474
So, you know how in Cosmos,
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?

19:00.557 --> 19:01.683
Like, beyond our world?

19:01.767 --> 19:03.268
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

19:03.352 --> 19:04.436
Right, theoretically.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.105
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

19:07.189 --> 19:08.398
You guys have been thinking about

19:08.482 --> 19:10.567
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation,
haven't you?

19:12.778 --> 19:15.280
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.782
Just like our world,

19:16.865 --> 19:19.326
but just infinite variations of it.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.578
Which means there's a world out there

19:21.662 --> 19:23.246
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.499
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.125
-Oh.
-We were thinking of more

19:27.209 --> 19:28.752
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.379
You know the Vale of Shadows?

19:30.462 --> 19:32.881
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic--

19:32.964 --> 19:33.965
Yeah, exactly.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.426
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

19:36.510 --> 19:37.844
how would we travel there?

19:37.928 --> 19:39.805
- Theoretically.
- Well...

19:44.768 --> 19:47.354
Picture... an acrobat...

19:48.605 --> 19:49.815
standing on a tightrope.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.526
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.070
And our dimension has rules.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.989
You can move forwards, or backwards.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.075
But, what if...

20:00.158 --> 20:04.287
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

20:04.371 --> 20:07.499
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.875
-Right?
-Right.

20:08.959 --> 20:11.253
Here's where things
get really interesting.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.630
The flea can also travel this way...

20:13.714 --> 20:15.841
along the side of the rope.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.551
He can even go...

20:18.510 --> 20:19.720
underneath the rope.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.013
- Upside down.
- Exactly.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.349
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.685
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.353
So we can't go upside down?

20:28.437 --> 20:29.771
No.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.607
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

20:32.691 --> 20:36.278
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.156
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

20:39.239 --> 20:41.533
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

20:41.616 --> 20:42.826
and then...

20:48.874 --> 20:50.083
you create a doorway.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.836
-Like a gate?
-Sure. Like a gate.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.714
-But again, this is all--
-Theoretical.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.258
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

20:58.341 --> 21:00.761
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.137
It would disrupt gravity,

21:02.220 --> 21:04.181
the magnetic field, our environment.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.683
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.478
Science is neat.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.314
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

21:23.825 --> 21:24.951
Whoa.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.539
Hey, Chief!

21:30.457 --> 21:32.250
- Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

21:33.919 --> 21:36.546
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

21:36.630 --> 21:40.300
-We tried calling, but--
-Yeah, the phone's dead.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.805
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.557
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

21:47.641 --> 21:48.683
and they didn't come back home.

21:48.767 --> 21:53.230
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.567
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.277
-Where was this?
-It was at the station.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.279
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

22:01.363 --> 22:03.240
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

22:03.740 --> 22:04.825
Mirkwood.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.159
What?

22:06.660 --> 22:07.994
Okay.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.789
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

22:11.331 --> 22:13.542
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, leave it.

22:13.625 --> 22:17.087
-Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
-What?

22:17.170 --> 22:20.090
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.717
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

22:22.801 --> 22:25.845
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.724
Yeah.
It's funny.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.856
- Is he off his meds again?

22:36.940 --> 22:39.568
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.902
That's what I think.

22:47.993 --> 22:50.036
What are you doing?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.746
What does it look like I'm doing?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.373
You want to freeze to death all winter?

22:56.334 --> 23:00.589
-I told you not to take these down.
-They were in the way, babe.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.049
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

23:07.846 --> 23:10.390
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.267
-What?
-The Sattler Company.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.060
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.146
I just wanted to look around, you know?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.732
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

23:20.859 --> 23:23.403
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.531
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.413
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.581
But that's got to be what happened.

23:34.664 --> 23:38.710
-Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
-Right.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.671
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

23:43.632 --> 23:45.508
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

23:52.390 --> 23:54.559
Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

23:54.643 --> 23:55.894
-Dustin!
-Dustin!

23:56.936 --> 23:58.897
-I... I need to see your compasses.
-What?

23:58.980 --> 24:01.274
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

24:06.780 --> 24:08.365
What's exciting about this?

24:08.448 --> 24:11.951
-Well, they're all facing north, right?
-Yeah, so?

24:12.035 --> 24:13.912
-Well, that's not true north.
-What do you mean?

24:13.995 --> 24:17.082
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.501
Are you both seriously this dense?

24:21.211 --> 24:25.715
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

24:25.799 --> 24:28.176
Which means that's true north.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.969
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

24:30.053 --> 24:33.515
Do you even understand
how a compass works?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.850
-Do you see a battery pack on this?
-No.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.936
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.814
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.315
So what's wrong with them?

24:42.399 --> 24:44.401
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.528
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.988
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

24:49.072 --> 24:50.782
the needle deflects to that power.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.534
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.285
The gate would have so much power--

24:54.369 --> 24:55.954
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.080
Exactly.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.541
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

24:59.624 --> 25:01.584
They should lead us to the gate.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.140
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.477
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

26:01.186 --> 26:04.147
-Nothing.
-I hope that's not meant for me.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.607
What? No.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.734
Oh, no, I was just...

26:08.693 --> 26:11.571
-thinking about joining softball.
-Oh.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.531
Well, uh...

26:13.615 --> 26:14.949
listen, I'm really sorry.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.786
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.622
Okay.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.207
I panicked and...

26:23.458 --> 26:27.086
-I mean, I was a total dick.
-Yeah, you were.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.801
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

26:32.884 --> 26:34.135
Totally, but...

26:34.219 --> 26:36.387
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.306
Any news about Barbara?

26:40.141 --> 26:42.352
-Parents heard from her? Or...
-No.

26:45.522 --> 26:46.523
Hey, listen.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.609
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

26:49.692 --> 26:52.362
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.239
All The Right Moves is still playing.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.742
You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business?

26:57.826 --> 26:58.868
Yeah, I know.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.620
You know, Carol thinks
I actually kinda look like him.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.455
What do you think? Huh?

27:02.539 --> 27:05.625

Off the shelf ♪

27:05.708 --> 27:08.211

27:08.294 --> 27:11.673
I just, I... I don't think I can.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.219
I've been really busy
with this whole funeral thing and...

27:16.302 --> 27:18.429
with my brother.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.223
It's been really hard on him.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.934
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

27:24.853 --> 27:26.396
So...

27:29.023 --> 27:30.149
I should go.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.318
Sorry.

27:34.279 --> 27:37.031
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?

27:39.617 --> 27:41.786
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.749
♪ Just take those old records

- You were here for the money!
- No!

28:01.973 --> 28:04.559
The money!
Admit it!

28:04.642 --> 28:08.187
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

28:08.313 --> 28:11.566
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

28:11.649 --> 28:14.193
-I can't believe I fell for this.
-I'm here to help, Joyce.

28:14.277 --> 28:16.529
-To help?
-We could use that money for good.

28:16.613 --> 28:19.282
Oh, like maybe
to pay off your debts?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.701
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

28:21.784 --> 28:23.912
-Oh, don't do that.
-Do what?

28:23.995 --> 28:25.997
-Lie to me!
-I'm not lying to you!

28:26.080 --> 28:27.457
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.583
-Huh?
-What?

28:28.666 --> 28:30.251
Where does Jonathan
want to go to college?

28:30.335 --> 28:32.253
We get that money,
anywhere he damn well pleases!

28:32.337 --> 28:34.088
NYU, Lonnie!

28:34.172 --> 28:37.717
He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

28:37.800 --> 28:40.094
So then he goes to NYU!

28:40.178 --> 28:41.346
Get out.

28:42.472 --> 28:43.890
Get out!

28:44.724 --> 28:45.975
You need me here, Joyce.

28:46.059 --> 28:49.687
Oh, brother,
I have not needed you for a long time!

28:49.771 --> 28:52.065
Oh, no?
Look what happened.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.319
Oh, don't you dare.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.863
-At least I was here!
-Oh, come on, Joyce.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.823
Just look around at this place.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.283
All your Christmas lights.

29:02.367 --> 29:05.453
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

29:05.536 --> 29:08.748
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

29:08.831 --> 29:13.836
But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

29:13.920 --> 29:16.631
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

29:18.174 --> 29:20.635
Now, get out!

29:21.219 --> 29:22.804
Get out of my house!

29:35.316 --> 29:37.944
You're supposed
to hit the cans, right?

29:39.529 --> 29:43.157
No, actually, you see the spaces
in between the cans?

29:43.241 --> 29:45.118
I'm aiming for those.

29:45.201 --> 29:46.244
Ah.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.081
You ever shot a gun before?

29:50.164 --> 29:53.042
- Have you met my parents?

29:53.960 --> 29:56.004
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.507
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.342
He made me kill a rabbit.

30:01.426 --> 30:03.219
-A rabbit?
-Yeah.

30:03.303 --> 30:07.015
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.434
I cried for a week.

30:09.517 --> 30:10.685
Jesus.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.021
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

30:13.104 --> 30:16.399
I meant your dad.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.692
Yeah.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.738
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

30:23.489 --> 30:25.158
...I wasn't around for that part.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.703
Um, yeah.

30:29.746 --> 30:32.248
Just, uh, point and shoot.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.211
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

30:37.295 --> 30:39.255
They must've married for some reason.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.715
My mom was young.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.176
My dad was older,

30:43.259 --> 30:48.348
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

30:49.974 --> 30:53.728
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

30:53.811 --> 30:55.772
and started their nuclear family.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.691
Screw that.

30:58.775 --> 30:59.942
Yeah.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.570
Screw that.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.085
- Hello?
- Hey.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.670
Jim?

31:19.754 --> 31:21.506
- Yeah.

31:21.589 --> 31:24.258
Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.

31:24.342 --> 31:26.969
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

31:27.053 --> 31:29.430
I just wanted to hear your voice
and, uh...

31:31.391 --> 31:33.643
I just wanted to say that, um...

31:38.106 --> 31:40.525
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

31:41.859 --> 31:43.277
I don't regret any of it.

31:43.361 --> 31:46.239
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.783
Have you been drinking?

31:50.326 --> 31:51.577
No.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.831
- No.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.041
Honey, hey...

31:57.125 --> 32:00.211
Hey, it's okay...
it's okay.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.923
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.383
Jim, I can't...

32:05.466 --> 32:07.552
Just take care of yourself, okay?

32:07.635 --> 32:09.011
Say hi to Bill for me.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.388
Are you sure--

32:37.039 --> 32:39.250
How much further?

32:40.293 --> 32:43.421
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.716
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.259
I'm just saying.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.761
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

32:50.845 --> 32:54.515
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.022
Do you think she's acting weird?

33:02.231 --> 33:04.692
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.904
I mean, weirder than normal?

33:09.030 --> 33:10.615
I don't know.
Who cares?

33:19.749 --> 33:20.917
How far, Papa?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.252
Farther than we've ever gone before.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.634
-The bath?
-Yes.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.261
Yes, the bath.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.058
Is that okay?

33:41.312 --> 33:42.355
Okay.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.570
Mike.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.031
Yeah?

35:15.114 --> 35:16.657
Turn back.

35:16.741 --> 35:18.284
What? Why?

35:18.367 --> 35:19.452
I'm tired.

35:19.535 --> 35:23.331
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

35:41.349 --> 35:43.142
You never said what I was saying.

35:44.393 --> 35:45.603
What?

35:45.686 --> 35:46.812
Yesterday.

35:46.896 --> 35:50.441
You said I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

35:50.524 --> 35:51.692
Oh, uh...

35:52.610 --> 35:53.861
I don't know.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.531
My guess...

35:59.533 --> 36:03.746
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.290
But for that moment...

36:06.374 --> 36:08.834
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

36:08.918 --> 36:11.295
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

36:14.215 --> 36:17.093
That is such bullshit.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.552
What?

36:19.970 --> 36:22.264
I am not trying to be someone else.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.850
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him--

36:24.934 --> 36:27.561
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

36:27.645 --> 36:29.647
He's actually a good guy.

36:29.730 --> 36:30.815
Okay.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.193
Yesterday, with the camera...

36:35.194 --> 36:37.321
He's not like that at all.

36:37.405 --> 36:39.699
He was just being protective.

36:39.782 --> 36:41.617
Yeah, that's one word for it.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.537
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

36:44.620 --> 36:46.122
No, I... I never said that.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.415
He had every right to be pissed--

36:47.498 --> 36:49.542
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

36:49.625 --> 36:51.043
No.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.212
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

36:53.295 --> 36:56.173
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.262
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.180
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:03.264 --> 37:06.350
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

37:06.434 --> 37:09.645
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

37:09.729 --> 37:11.731
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

37:11.814 --> 37:13.691
-Oh.
-I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

37:13.774 --> 37:16.694
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

37:16.777 --> 37:19.697
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

37:19.780 --> 37:22.408
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

37:22.491 --> 37:23.659
who now works sales,

37:23.743 --> 37:26.579
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.999
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

37:30.082 --> 37:32.084
but now, hey, they get it."

37:42.595 --> 37:44.305
Go away, Lonnie.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.309
Seriously!

37:49.226 --> 37:51.228
I am gonna murd--

37:53.606 --> 37:56.108
What? What?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.287
Oh, Jesus.

38:22.176 --> 38:23.803
Oh, no.

38:23.886 --> 38:26.680
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

38:26.764 --> 38:28.224
-We're headed back home.
-What?

38:28.307 --> 38:29.558
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.977
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

38:32.061 --> 38:34.605
And you're just realizing this now?

38:34.688 --> 38:37.608
-Why is this all on me?
-Because you're the compass genius!

38:37.691 --> 38:39.193
What do yours say?

38:39.276 --> 38:40.820
North.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.364
--Makes no damn sense.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.407
Maybe the gate moved.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.368
No, I don't think it's the gate.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.287
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.122
Maybe it's something here.

38:52.206 --> 38:54.625
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.377
It's not a magnet.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.379
She's been acting weirder than normal.

38:58.462 --> 39:01.298
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

39:01.382 --> 39:02.424
Why would she do that?

39:02.508 --> 39:04.468
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

39:04.552 --> 39:05.886
Because she's a traitor!

39:08.013 --> 39:09.932
Lucas, what are you doing?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.853
You did it, didn't you?

39:13.936 --> 39:15.729
You don't want us to reach the gate.

39:15.813 --> 39:17.648
You don't want us to find Will.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.858
Lucas, come on, seriously,

39:18.941 --> 39:20.109
-just leave her alone!
-Admit it.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.819
-No.
-Admit it!

39:22.903 --> 39:25.990
-Fresh blood. I knew it.
-Lucas, come on!

39:26.073 --> 39:29.159
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

39:29.243 --> 39:31.036
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

39:32.580 --> 39:34.206
Right, El?

39:36.959 --> 39:38.878
It's... not...

39:40.462 --> 39:42.506
it's not safe.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.069
Okay.

40:04.153 --> 40:05.738
Should be okay, I mean...

40:06.697 --> 40:08.824
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.576
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

40:10.659 --> 40:12.870
They bugged my place.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.288
-What?
-They bugged my place.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.832
They put a microphone in the light.

40:19.543 --> 40:22.171
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.964
-I don't know...
-Who?

40:24.048 --> 40:25.424
I thought they might be watching you, too.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.761
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

40:28.844 --> 40:31.013
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not--

40:31.096 --> 40:34.141
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.602
What?

40:37.227 --> 40:38.604
It wasn't him.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.522
What?

40:40.606 --> 40:42.733
Will's body, it was a fake.

40:49.949 --> 40:51.408
You were right.

40:54.078 --> 40:56.080
This whole time, you were right.

41:01.585 --> 41:04.213
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

41:04.296 --> 41:06.507
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

41:06.590 --> 41:07.591
Find Will?

41:07.675 --> 41:08.926
Find Will?

41:09.009 --> 41:12.388
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.140
-Yeah, you know what I mean.
-No, I actually don't.

41:15.224 --> 41:16.475
Just think about it, Mike.

41:16.558 --> 41:19.228
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

41:19.311 --> 41:20.396
but she didn't.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.439
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.149
-All right, calm down!
-No!

41:24.233 --> 41:26.026
She used us, all of us!

41:26.110 --> 41:28.487
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.780
Food and a bed.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.074
-She's like a stray dog.
-Screw you, Lucas!

41:32.157 --> 41:34.159
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

41:34.243 --> 41:36.537
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.081
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

41:39.999 --> 41:41.208
She knows where Will is,

41:41.291 --> 41:44.086
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.630
-Shut up!
-For all we know, it's her fault.

41:46.714 --> 41:47.756
Shut up.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.300
We're looking for some stupid monster...

41:50.384 --> 41:54.596
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

41:55.723 --> 41:57.016
I said shut up!

41:58.350 --> 42:00.519
- Stop!
- Knock it off, you idiots.

42:00.602 --> 42:01.937
- Stop it!
- Mike, get off!

42:02.021 --> 42:03.981
- Stop it!

42:09.445 --> 42:10.446
Jesus!

42:12.698 --> 42:15.325
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

42:15.409 --> 42:17.161
-Lucas.
-Lucas, come on!

42:17.244 --> 42:19.329
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- Come on, Lucas!

42:19.413 --> 42:21.081
Why would you do that?

42:22.166 --> 42:23.542
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

42:24.460 --> 42:26.837
What is wrong with you?

43:39.159 --> 43:41.995
--What is that?

43:42.996 --> 43:44.414
I have no idea.

43:59.805 --> 44:03.308
Help! Help!

44:05.894 --> 44:07.187
Come on, wake up.
Come on!

44:08.397 --> 44:10.232
Lucas...
Lucas, come on!

44:14.111 --> 44:15.404
Lucas.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.573
Lucas, you okay?

44:18.824 --> 44:21.743
Lucas... Lucas,
how many fingers am I holding up?

44:21.827 --> 44:23.203
Lucas, how many fingers?

44:23.287 --> 44:25.289
- Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

44:25.372 --> 44:27.791
Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.168
Get off of me!

44:31.545 --> 44:33.297
-Lucas, come on.
-Let him go.

44:36.175 --> 44:37.593
Man, let him go.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.932
Where is El?

44:45.934 --> 44:47.144
El?

44:47.978 --> 44:49.563
-El!
-Eleven!

44:51.440 --> 44:52.482
El!

44:53.859 --> 44:55.569
-Eleven!
-El!

44:56.737 --> 44:57.863
Eleven!

45:22.971 --> 45:24.222
What, are you tired?

45:24.306 --> 45:25.766
Shut up.

45:25.849 --> 45:26.892
What?

45:29.227 --> 45:32.022
I heard something.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.378
- Oh, God.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.845
It's been hit by a car.

46:10.102 --> 46:11.520
We can't just leave it.

46:27.244 --> 46:28.620
I'll do it.

46:30.706 --> 46:33.166
-I thought you said--
-I'm not nine anymore.

47:02.237 --> 47:03.405
What was that?

47:34.978 --> 47:36.313
Where'd it go?

47:37.939 --> 47:39.483
I don't know.

47:41.902 --> 47:43.528
Do you see any more blood?

47:44.571 --> 47:46.073
No.

48:32.702 --> 48:33.912
Jonathan?

50:08.840 --> 50:10.383
Nancy!

50:16.014 --> 50:17.432
Nancy?

50:18.767 --> 50:20.060
Nancy?

50:21.102 --> 50:22.687
Nancy, where are you?

50:25.106 --> 50:26.441
Nancy!

50:27.776 --> 50:28.985
Nancy!
