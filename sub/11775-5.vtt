WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.142
( music playing )

00:25.159 --> 00:27.228
LOOK AT THIS.
TAKES UP TWO SPACES,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.630
PARKS OVER THE LINE.
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT--

00:29.730 --> 00:32.600
EVERYBODY'S GOTTA MOVE
DOWN NOW BECAUSE OF HIM.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.605
( chattering )

00:41.342 --> 00:43.411
- AH, THERE THEY ARE.
- AH.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.447
- HELLO.
- OH! WELL, THIS IS
QUITE A PARTY.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.483
- I KNOW.
- YOU'RE THROWING FOR
YOURSELVES, I MIGHT ADD.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.386
- WE'RE BELOVED.
- I MEAN, USUALLY
SOMEBODY ELSE GIVES YOU

00:52.486 --> 00:54.688
- A GOING-AWAY PARTY...
- Susie: NOT ALWAYS.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.258
- ...BUT YOU'VE DECIDED
TO GIVE ONE FOR YOURSELVES.
- WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.327
IT'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY
FOR SAMMI.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.563
NOT EVERYBODY GETS
INTO THE JULLIARD
SUMMER PROGRAM.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.865
- THEY DON'T TAKE EVERYBODY?
- NO, YOU HAVE TO AUDITION.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.134
- SHE AUDITIONED, LARRY.
- SHE AUDITIONED?

01:06.234 --> 01:08.068
YEAH. LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.538
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER.
WHEN SHE GETS ONSTAGE...

01:10.638 --> 01:12.540
- NO, I-I-I-I--
- ...SHE LIGHTS UP THE ROOM

01:12.640 --> 01:15.643
- MMM.
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
CRITICIZE MY KID, LARRY?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.578
I'M NOT CRITICIZING.
I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS
TO DO IT.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.113
- I THINK YOU'RE
PUSHING HER INTO IT.
- Susie: REALLY?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.549
- YES.
- NO, IT'S ALL HER DESIRE.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.751
- I THINK YOU ARE.
- WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.819
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK I AM.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.122
- WHAT, ARE YOU
MAKING FUN OF ME NOW?
- YES. YES, I AM.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.991
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST THING
ABOUT GOING TO NEW YORK IS?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.227
I'M NOT GONNA SEE YOUR FACE
FOR THREE MONTHS.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.396
- SHE'S FUNNY--
- WE'LL ALL BE AVOIDING YOU.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.198
- HEY, FUNKMAN.
- HI, MARTY.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.233
WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO TAKE UP
TWO PARKING SPACES?

01:39.333 --> 01:42.236
YOU MADE ME TAKE
TWO PARKING SPACES, OKAY?

01:42.336 --> 01:45.005
YES, I CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.441
I TOO WAS UPSET
WHEN I SAW THE RED VOLVO

01:47.541 --> 01:49.777
TO MY LEFT ALSO
TAKING UP TWO SPACES.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.546
- HE CREATED A DOMINO EFFECT.
- Marty: THERE'S NO VOLVO
OUT THERE.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.048
- THERE WAS
WHEN I PARKED, OKAY?
- OKAY, GREAT.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.484
- ALL RIGHT.
- ANYWAY, GUYS...

01:56.584 --> 01:59.253
- YES.
- ...I JUST WANNA TELL YA
I'M GONNA MISS YA.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.489
- OH, MARTY.
- WE'LL MISS YOU TOO, MARTY.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.457
- I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.
- Susie: ALL RIGHT.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.526
SOME PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN OUR DAUGHTER,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.928
- THANK YOU, MARTY.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.598
HEY, VANCE, VANCE,
THANKS FOR COMING.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.733
( silent )

02:12.833 --> 02:14.802
HEY, VANCE.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.206
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
WHAT, HAVE YOU
GOT LARYNGITIS?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.075
Susie:
VOW OF SILENCE.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.813
- TOOK A VOW OF SILENCE.
- ( chuckles ) YOU TOOK
A VOW OF SILENCE?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.352
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR?
IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.787
AND HE TOLD YOU TO DO THIS?
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

02:35.423 --> 02:37.725
YOU KNOW, I'VE TRIED
TO GET SUSIE TO TAKE
A VOW OF SILENCE.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.093
- ( chuckles )
- Jeff: I HAVE. I'VE TALKED
TO HER ABOUT IT.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.697
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
I HAVE TOO MANY IMPORTANT
THINGS TO SAY.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.933
SEE, THAT'S FUNNY.
MEANWHILE, HE'S TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE IT.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.402
IT'S JUST
YOU'RE MOUTHING--

02:48.502 --> 02:51.539
OH, IT'S OKAY TO MOUTH.
IT'S OKAY TO MOUTH.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.377
YOU'RE STILL
COMMUNICATING, BUT IN
A MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE WAY.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.713
ALL RIGHT,
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.583
( silent )

03:02.683 --> 03:06.086
YEAH, YOU TWO GO,
GO EAT. GO STUFF
YOUR FACE, BOTH OF YOU.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.721
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.495
Jeff:
A BIT OF A WARNING--
TESSLER IS COMING TONIGHT.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.464
I'M PRETTY SURE.
HE ASKED IF YOU
WERE AVAILABLE

03:16.564 --> 03:18.532
TO DO SOME SORT
OF BENEFIT.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.468
I BET IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS SON,
THE SPECIAL NEEDS KID.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.769
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS UP ON THAT.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.471
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THAT.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.473
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S TAKING
THIS LINE SO LONG?

03:25.573 --> 03:28.809
UH, THAT'D BE
MY VETERINARIAN
AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.312
- Larry: WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
- Jeff: HE AND HIS WIFE CAME.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.848
OSCAR'S REALLY SICK,
SO SUSIE FELT LIKE IT'D
BE NICE TO INVITE HIM.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.084
- SO YEAH.
- OH.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.187
- BRIAN? HEY.
- HI.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.657
- KRISTA. KRISTA FERGUSON.
- OH, UH, I-- YEAH.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.659
- Krista:
IT WAS SMITH, PROBABLY.
- Brent: HEY. OH, OKAY.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.861
- YOU SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON OVER HERE?
- NO.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.063
- Brent: I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE YOU.
- SHE'S DOING A CHAT AND CUT.

03:50.163 --> 03:54.034
- A CHAT AND CUT? REALLY?
- SHE'S FEIGNING FAMILIARITY

03:54.134 --> 03:55.769
WITH SOMEONE
SHE VAGUELY KNOWS

03:55.869 --> 03:57.505
- FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF CUTTING IN LINE.
- YOU'RE SURE?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.473
POSITIVE.
SHE'LL BE PICKING UP
A PLATE ANY SECOND.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.642
YOU LOOK--
YOU'RE LIKE BEAMING
WITH LIGHT.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.678
THERE-- THERE SHE GOES.
YEAH. UH, EXCUSE ME.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.179
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU. YEAH? HI.
- EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.781
HI, FIRST OF ALL.

04:07.881 --> 04:12.052
CONGRATULATIONS
ON A GREAT ATTEMPT
AT A CHAT AND CUT.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.954
REALLY GOOD.
99 TIMES OUT OF 100,

04:14.054 --> 04:16.290
THAT'S GONNA WORK.
UNFORTUNATELY,

04:16.390 --> 04:19.527
I HAPPEN TO BE
ON THE LINE SO--

04:19.627 --> 04:21.161
OKAY, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.497
- I JUST SAW MY FRIEND--
- I KNOW A CHAT AND CUT
WHEN I SEE IT.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.766
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- YOU USED THIS FELLOW--

04:25.866 --> 04:28.268
THIS POOR, INNOCENT FELLOW
TO SNEAK INTO THE LINE.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.070
DO YOU EVEN--
DO YOU KNOW HER AT ALL?

04:30.170 --> 04:32.039
WELL, I MEAN--
I MEAN, TO BE FAIR,

04:32.139 --> 04:33.641
WE MET LIKE
EIGHT YEARS AGO. I--

04:33.741 --> 04:36.810
- HE REMEMBERS, SO--
- NO, I-- I HONESTLY DON'T.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.647
- YOU THINK SHE'S
DOING A CHAT AND CUT?
- I KINDA FEEL LIKE YOU ARE.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.148
- YEAH. YOU SEE?
- I FEEL A LITTLE MANIPULATED.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.750
- YEAH, HE'S BEEN--
- OH, FINE. OKAY.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.852
HE'S BEEN MANIPULATED.
YOU MANIPULATED HIM,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.588
YOU WANT ME TO GET BACK
IN LINE? WOULD THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

04:47.688 --> 04:50.157
- YES, IT WOULD. YES. YEAH.
- FINE. OKAY. FINE.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.925
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.093
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.294
YEAH, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:54.395 --> 04:55.996
YOU JUST HAVE TO--
THAT'S YOUR JOB--

04:56.096 --> 04:57.765
- BUST PEOPLE
AS THEY COME THROUGH...
- YEAH. UH-HUH.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.233
- ...SO YOU CAN.
- AND LOOK, YOU JUST
DID IT AGAIN.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.202
- WHAT? NO, I'M-- I'M--
- OH SO, SERIOUSLY,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.971
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
SAY ANYTHING THIS TIME.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.240
I RESPECT
YOUR SKILLS, REALLY.

05:07.341 --> 05:11.779
- EXCELLENT.
( clicks tongue )
- THANKS.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.482
SERIOUSLY, HOW MUCH WOULD
IT TAKE FOR YOU TO SEE,
"EAT PRAY LOVE?"

05:17.284 --> 05:19.319
- $3,000.
- Both: $3,000?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.988
IT'S NOT THAT BAD
OF A MOVIE. WE SAW IT.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.756
TO ACTUALLY GO
TO THE THEATER
AND SIT IN THE THEATER?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.525
- SIT IN THE THEATER, YEAH.
- THAT'S $3,000.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.594
- $3,000?
- YEAH. LET ME
ASK YOU THIS QUESTION:

05:26.694 --> 05:30.130
IN VETERINARY SCHOOL,
DO YOU TEND TO FOCUS
MORE ON THE DOG,

05:30.230 --> 05:32.099
LET'S SAY,
THAN-- THAN THE COW?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.001
NO YOU FOCUS
ON EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW--

05:34.101 --> 05:36.604
- WHAT IF I BROUGHT A ROACH IN?
- LISTEN, IF YOU BROUGHT
A ROACH IN

05:36.704 --> 05:38.539
AND YOU SAY
YOU LOVE THAT ROACH,
I'M GONNA DO WHAT I CAN

05:38.639 --> 05:42.075
TO GIVE IT
EVERY CHANCE IT HAS.
I MEAN, THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.945
WHEN DO YOU GET THE REPORTS
ON OSCAR, BY THE WAY?
I MEANT TO ASK YOU THAT.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.314
PROBABLY TONIGHT,
SO WE SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING
WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR SO.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.649
I'M CROSSING
MY FINGERS FOR YOU.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.818
I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.220
OKAY, I'M GONNA GET
SOME COFFEE. DOES ANYBODY--
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.788
- NO THANKS.
- Woman: THANKS.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.590
YOU SEE A RAT IN THE HOUSE,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KILL IT?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.792
YES, IF I SEE
A RAT IN THE HOUSE,
I WANT TO KILL IT.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.495
WHAT IF YOU INJURED IT?
WOULD YOU THEN BRING IT
INTO HIS OFFICE

06:01.595 --> 06:03.363
FOR HIM TO SAVE IT?
YOU SEE WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.165
MMM, NO.
HE SAVES PETS.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.234
IF SOME MORON HAS A RAT
FOR A PET, HE'LL SAVE THAT.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.703
- MM-HMM. OF COURSE.
- BUT IF THAT SAME RAT
IS IN THE HOUSE--

06:09.803 --> 06:12.039
- AH, I DON'T KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:12.139 --> 06:16.577
- I'M GONNA GO MINGLE.
- SO DOES HE DEAL WITH
ANY FARM ANIMALS--

06:16.677 --> 06:18.646
PIGS, THINGS
OF THAT NATURE?

06:18.746 --> 06:22.015
EVERY NOW AND THEN
A PIG, ONCE A HORSE,
BUT IT'S PRETTY RARE.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.484
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY DON'T HAVE SPECIALTIES.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.286
"I'M A DONKEY VET.
I'M A RABBIT VET.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.921
I'M A TURTLE VET."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.691
IN HUMANS,
THERE'S AN E.N.T.,
THERE'S A PODIATRIST.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.160
THE WAY YOU'RE SAYING IT,
IT'S ALMOST LIKE

06:33.260 --> 06:36.063
THERE SHOULD BE
A DOCTOR WHO HANDLES
JUST FEATHERS.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.631
YES. HOW DOES A VET DO?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.366
WHAT DO THEY MAKE,
A GUY LIKE THAT?

06:39.467 --> 06:41.301
A VET, DO THEY MAKE
AS MUCH AS A DOCTOR?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.971
- ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?
- YEAH.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.807
WOW. LARRY,
THAT'S A VERY
PERSONAL QUESTION.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.976
- REALLY?
- I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WANT ME

06:49.076 --> 06:51.512
- TO ASK YOU A BUNCH
OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS.
- ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.548
OKAY, WHEN IS
THE LAST TIME
YOU JACKED OFF?

06:54.648 --> 06:58.151
MMM. THIS MORNING.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.954
- I SHOULD GO. OKAY.
- OH. OKAY.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.191
- ( clears throat ) YEAH.
- NICE TALKING TO YOU.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.037

07:25.479 --> 07:26.914

PHYSICAL PROBLEMS,
MENTAL PROBLEMS,

07:41.629 --> 07:44.932
LEARNING PROBLEMS.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A WORKSHOP.

I-- I'M GOING OUT
OF TOWN ON SATURDAY.

08:32.713 --> 08:36.183
MAYBE NEXT YEAR
OR THE NEXT TIME
WE HAVE AN EVENT,

08:36.283 --> 08:37.517
I'LL GET IN TOUCH
WITH YOU, OKAY?

08:37.618 --> 08:39.319
SORRY YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT THIS TIME.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.555
- AGAIN, REALLY REALLY SORRY.
- OKAY.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.923
WE'LL MISS YOU THIS YEAR,
BUT NEXT YEAR WE WON'T.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.558
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.894

08:47.995 --> 08:50.363

- HELLO.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.699
HEY, RICHIE,
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE VET'S.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.834
I'M GONNA MEET JEFF
FOR LUNCH.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.003
- Why are you
going to the vet's?
- OSCAR'S REALLY SICK?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.437
YOU SHOULD JUST
LET HIM TAKE CARE OF IT.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.939
WHAT ARE YOU,
DR. DOLITTLE?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.440
ANYWAY, DO YOU WANT
TO GO TO LUNCH WITH US?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.075
NO, I CAN'T.
I'M GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.578
WELL, THEN WHAT ABOUT FRIDAY?
WE'LL HAVE LUNCH ON FRIDAY.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.446
I'll meet you at that place
on Wilshire and 24th.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.349
- I LIKE THAT JOINT.
- OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU
FRIDAY, 1:00.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.018
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.429
- Jeff: HEY.
- HEY.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.865
- HOW'S OSCAR?
- NOT GOOD.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.700
WAITING FOR THE WORD
FROM THE DOCTOR.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.368
- OKAY, WANT TO GET
SOME LUNCH?
- STARVING.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.569
- ME TOO.
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.071
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL EAT ANYTHING.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.840
THERE'S A GREAT MEXICAN PLACE
RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.875
- YEAH, NOT-- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU DON'T WANT MEXICAN?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.510
- NOT MEXICAN, NO.
- SUSHI. SUSHI'S FANTASTIC.
NICE AND LIGHT.

09:37.611 --> 09:41.014
I'M READING
ALL THIS MERCURY STUFF.
I'M SCARED TO GET SUSHI.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.483
- I CAN'T EAT SUSHI.
- HOW ABOUT SOME ITALIAN?
WANNA GET SOME PASTA?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.918
I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE
HOT FOOD FOR LUNCH.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.754
WHAT ABOUT A PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY SANDWICH?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.188
I DON'T WANT BREAD.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE BREAD.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.790
LIKE A PLATE WITH--
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY

09:49.890 --> 09:51.959
JUST ON A PLATE
WITH A FORK?

09:52.059 --> 09:55.528
- ( sighs )
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING SO
STRESSED OUT ABOUT THIS FOR?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.731
- I CAN'T DECIDE.
- IT'S LUNCH!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.266
LET'S GO TO GJELINA.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.702
I'LL GET THAT SPINACH SALAD
WITH SOME SOUP.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.271
- THAT'S GOOD.
- FANTASTIC.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.875
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
I WANT THAT SALAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.242
- LET'S EAT
AT ANOTHER PLACE.
- JEFF?

10:09.342 --> 10:10.778
- Jeff: HI.
- NOT GOOD.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.546
- NO?
- IT'S NOT GOOD.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.249
THE TESTS CAME BACK POSITIVE
FOR LEPTOSPIROSIS.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.719
I WAS JUST TELLING
SUSIE WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PUT OSCAR DOWN.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.288
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.
- SORRY, YOU GUYS.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.490
- SO--
- HE WAS SUCH
A GOOD DOG, YOU KNOW?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.525
- YEAH, HE WAS
A GREAT DOG. A GREAT DOG.
- HE HAD SUCH A GOOD LIFE.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.895
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.730
DID YOU NOTICE,
BY ANY CHANCE,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.465
IF YOUR WIFE WAS
UPSET LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU GOT HOME?

10:32.565 --> 10:35.302
- NO, NOT THAT I--
NOT THAT I NOTICED.
- WE HAVE THINGS TO DISCUSS.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.638
- DID SHE MENTION MY NAME?
- NO, IT DID NOT COME UP
LAST NIGHT.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.573
SO, DOCTOR,
WHAT'S THE PROCESS?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.375
- HE'S NOT GONNA FEEL PAIN?
- HE'S NOT GONNA FEEL ANYTHING.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.878
WE WILL MAKE HIM AND YOU
AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.080
- OKAY?
- IS SHE THE TYPE OF WOMAN

10:47.180 --> 10:49.883
WHO WOULD CONFIDE IN YOU
IF SHE WAS UPSET?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.451
WE'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT MY WIFE RIGHT NOW?

10:51.551 --> 10:53.586
- YEAH, YOU GOT THAT KIND
OF A RELATIONSHIP?
- YES, WE DO.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.955
LIKE A MARRIED RELATIONSHIP?
WE DO HAVE THAT KIND--

10:55.055 --> 10:56.757
YEAH. YOU DISCUSS
THINGS LIKE THAT?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.358
- WE DO.
- A LOT OF MARRIED COUPLES
DON'T DO THAT.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.893
SHE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT YOU!

10:59.993 --> 11:01.829
YOU'RE NOT THE CENTER
OF THE UNIVERSE!

11:01.929 --> 11:05.065
RIGHT NOW OSCAR IS!
HE'S GONNA DIE ANY
MINUTE NOW, OKAY?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.134
I WAS JUST CURIOUS,
THOUGH, AS YOU WOULD BE TOO

11:07.234 --> 11:10.137
IF YOU THOUGHT
SOMEBODY WAS ANNOYED,
BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY KNOW.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.839
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:11.939 --> 11:13.540
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST CURIOUS,
THAT'S ALL.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.608
- WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DO ME
A FAVOR, ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.577
I'M JUST THINKING,
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

11:17.677 --> 11:18.946
FOR HIM TO HAVE
A LAST MEAL?

11:19.046 --> 11:20.680
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I ENCOURAGE IT.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.616
- SO THE DOG COULD
HAVE A BIG CHOCOLATE BAR?
- DOGS HAVE LAST MEALS?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.185
- HE LOVES PINKBERRY.
- IF HE LOVES PINKBERRY,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.586
- THEN THAT'S WHAT
HE SHOULD HAVE.
- COCONUT.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.521
CAN YOU GO
GET IT, JEFF? OKAY?

11:28.621 --> 11:30.791
- WE'RE GOING OUT TO LUNCH NOW.
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LUNCH.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.627
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LUNCH.
YOU'RE GOING TO PINKBERRY
AND YOU'RE COMING BACK.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.096
BUT NEITHER OF US HAVE
EATEN SINCE BREAKFAST.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.464
I DON'T REALLY GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT YOU.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.666
I CARE ABOUT
OSCAR RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.601
HE'S IN PAIN.
HE'S GONNA DIE SOON.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.236
HE NEEDS
HIS LAST MEAL.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.572
- PINKBERRY, RIGHT BACK.
- NO LUNCH. WHO THE FUCK
NEEDS A LUNCH?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.707
- Susie: EXACTLY. I DON'T
WANT TO PROLONG THIS.
- NOT ME. COME ON.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.609
- PINKBERRY, COME ON.
- YOU DRIVE A RED VOLVO?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.845
DON'T DRIVE A RED VOLVO.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.981
- YOU SURE?
- I DRIVE A BLACK LEXUS.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.683
AH. WOW.
THAT'S SOME CAR.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.686
- YOU DO PRETTY WELL, DON'T YOU?
- THANK YOU, LARRY.
I'M A DOCTOR.

11:59.787 --> 12:03.223
- YOU MAKE AS MUCH
AS A REGULAR DOCTOR?
- GET ME THE FUCKING PINKBERRY!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.759
- JUST CURIOUS. OKAY.
- JUST GO! HURRY UP!

12:05.859 --> 12:09.329
- TIME IS
OF THE ESSENCE! GOD.
- COME ON.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.172
( door opens, closes )

12:19.272 --> 12:24.644
EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH THAT PARK?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.679
- YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
- YOU'RE WAY OUTSIDE THE LINE.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.182
- YOU'RE TAKING UP TWO SPACES.
- I'M LIKE AN INCH
OVER THE LINE.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.884
NO, YOU'RE A FOOT
OVER THE LINE.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.319
YOU'RE TAKING UP
TWO SPACES,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.788
THE NEXT CAR
IS ALSO GONNA BE
TAKING UP TWO SPACES

12:34.888 --> 12:37.858
THEN YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
AND THEN THAT CAR IS
GONNA GET BLAMED.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.993
THIS IS CHAOS.
SOCIETY CAN'T
FUNCTION LIKE THIS.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.195
- WHAT?
- YOU HAVE TO BE
IN THE LINES,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.997
- THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
- HEY, HERE'S AN IDEA.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.833
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.434
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S AN IDEA,

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
- NOT A VERY GOOD ONE THOUGH.
- YEAH. OH NO?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.338
JUST SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO BETTER NEXT TIME."

12:51.438 --> 12:53.874
- I DID FINE. I DID FINE.
- NO, THAT'S NOT FINE.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.608
- I DON'T NEED TO DO BETTER.
- YOU DIDN'T DO FINE.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.277
- YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.
YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.
- NO, I DID FINE.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.913
- THAT'S JUST SHODDY.
- I REALLY GIVE A SHIT

13:00.013 --> 13:01.849
WHAT YOU THINK
OF MY PARKING JOB,
OKAY, PAL?

13:01.949 --> 13:04.217
IT'S NOT AN OPEN FIELD.
IT'S NOT A FARM, OKAY?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.520
- JUST-- JUST PARK YOUR CAR
BETWEEN THE LINES.
- A FARM?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.157
IT'S NOT THAT HARD!
LOOK, JUST PULL IN
BETWEEN THE LINES.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.559
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
BETWEEN THE LINES

13:12.659 --> 13:14.261
OF YOUR OWN
GODDAMN BUSINESS, HUH?

13:14.361 --> 13:17.364
WHY DON'T YOU STAY CONFINED
WITHIN THE LINES

13:17.464 --> 13:21.201
OF NOT BEING AN ASSHOLE?
'CAUSE YOU'RE WAY OVER
THAT LINE.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.236
- ALL RIGHT?
- THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S THE ASSHOLE HERE

13:23.336 --> 13:25.205
- IS THE PIG PARKER.
- A PIG PARKER?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.607
- YES.
- SO YOU'RE CALLING ME A PIG?

13:27.707 --> 13:30.143
- A PIG PARKER.
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.145
- HAVE A REAL NICE DAY.
- OKAY, I WILL.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.014

13:46.159 --> 13:48.428

13:48.528 --> 13:51.031
- TESSLER'S OUT THERE.
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN NEW YORK.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.565
- DID HE SEE YOU?
- NO.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.768
YO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:55.869 --> 13:58.271
NOTHING.
TALKING TO MY FRIEND.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.540
I KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
HE'S ABOUT TO DO
A CHAT AND CUT.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.175
- IT'S A TOTAL CHAT AND CUT.
- Jeff: NO NO NO NO NO NO.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.012
NO NO NO. NO, I KNOW
IT LOOKS LIKE A CHAT--

14:05.112 --> 14:06.613
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU WERE
CHATTING WITH YOUR FRIEND

14:06.713 --> 14:08.982
- AND THEN YOU CUT THE LINE.
- ARE YOU GUYS EVEN FRIENDS?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.118
PLEASE PLEASE,
DON'T INSULT ME, OKAY?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.353
I INVENTED
THE CHAT AND CUT.
THIS IS AMATEUR HOUR.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.156
- IF I WAS GONNA DO IT,
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
- YOU JUST DID IT.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.824
- JUST GET TO
THE BACK OF LINE, DUDE.
- YOU'VE GOTTA GET BACK.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.526

14:19.626 --> 14:21.228
- IT'S A CHAT AND CUT.
- NO, IT'S NOT A CHAT AND CUT!

14:21.328 --> 14:23.063

ALL RIGHT!
OKAY! I'M GOING!

14:24.431 --> 14:27.500

PROBABLY MORE LIKELY
SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS. YEAH.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.216

15:47.280 --> 15:49.382

15:49.482 --> 15:51.618
HE WOULD-- HE WOULD
DENY IT IF YOU ACTUALLY
SAID SOMETHING TO HIM.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.387
I'M THE WORLD'S FASTEST PREP
AS A DIRECTOR. YOU KNOW THAT.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.190

SOME YOGURT THERE.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.423
- YOU SHOULD'VE.
- I'M VERY STARVING.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.725
I'M STARVING TOO.
WHY DO WE LISTEN TO HER?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.264
- MIND IF I TAKE
A BITE OF THIS?
- I DO MIND.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.166
- THAT'S FOR OSCAR.
- COME ON, ONE BITE.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.533
- NO.
- LET ME TAKE ONE BITE.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.070
WHAT THE-- COME ON,
I'VE GOT LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.837
ONE BITE
BUT MAKE IT SMALL.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.240
SMALL SMALL SMALL.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.178
- OH!
- GOOD, HUH?

16:51.278 --> 16:54.847
- THAT IS REALLY GOOD.
- IS THERE ANOTHER SPOON
IN THE BAG?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.816
LET ME HAVE--
GIVE IT HERE FOR A SECOND.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.518
LET ME HAVE A TASTE.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.056
AH! IT'S GOOD.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.957
- ISN'T THAT GOOD?
- YUP.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.426
- BY THE WAY...
- MMM?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.861
...YOUR TASTE WAS ABOUT
TWICE AS BIG AS MINE.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.563
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT WAS A SMALL TASTE.
- NO, IT WAS ABOUT--

17:10.663 --> 17:12.499
NO, IT WAS ABOUT
AS TWICE AS BIG AS MINE.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.767
- JUST STOP IT. NO NO.
- I'M EVENING IT OUT,
THAT'S ALL.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.470
- EVENING IT OUT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YEAH, I JUST EVENED IT OUT.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.806
NO, NOW YOU'VE GOTTEN TWO
AND I'VE GOTTEN ONE.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.443
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.
- NO, MY TWO BITES WERE
THE SAME AS YOUR ONE.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.346
OH, RIGHT. OKAY.
I CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT YOU'RE EATING.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.581
LOOK AT THAT!
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THOSE BITES YOU TOOK!

17:28.681 --> 17:30.517
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
COME ON, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.352
- STOP IT.
NO, WE'RE EVEN.
- REALLY?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.121
- YOU'RE DONE.
- NO, BULLSHIT.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.922
YOU'RE-- BULLSHIT,
YOU'RE DONE.
IT'S FOR OS--

17:36.022 --> 17:37.324
- NO WAY, MAN.
- YOU'RE DONE!

17:37.424 --> 17:39.526
ONE MORE. LAST ONE, OKAY?
WE'LL HAVE ONE MORE.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.728
- THIS IS IT. OKAY, ONE MORE.
- OKAY, ONE-- ONE EACH MORE.

17:41.828 --> 17:45.498
ONE EACH MORE, OKAY?
THANK YOU.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.106
- YOU JUST TOOK TWO BITES!
- BULLSHIT.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.907
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BULLSHIT?
- I'M DRIVING! STOP!

17:55.007 --> 17:57.844
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT
TO BE A DICK, BE A DICK.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.612
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO BE A DICK...

17:59.712 --> 18:02.215
( muffled )
BE A FUCKING DICK! OKAY?!

18:02.315 --> 18:04.451
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- ( mumbles )

18:08.355 --> 18:12.325
- ( silent )
- OH, HEY, VANCE.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.097
I-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.233
WILL YOU JUST TALK,
PLEASE?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.437
PINKBERRY.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.476
- I-I-I-I-- JUST GO.
- I KNOW.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.278
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE.
- BYE.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.380
Larry:
SEE YOU, VANCE.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
JESUS, YOU'VE GOT
SOME STUFF ON YOUR FACE.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.555
GET THAT OFF.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.061
- JEFF?
- YEAH?

18:49.162 --> 18:52.064
- DID YOU GET IT?
- NOPE. CLOSED.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.800
- THEY WERE CLOSED?
- THEY WERE CLOSED.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.735
THEY'RE NEVER CLOSED.
THEY'RE OPEN TILL,
LIKE, MIDNIGHT.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.137
- WE GO AFTER
THE MOVIES ALL THE TIME.
- THEY-- I'M TELLING YA--

18:58.238 --> 19:00.440
- Larry: KOREAN HOLIDAY.
- A KOREAN HOLIDAY?

19:00.540 --> 19:03.410
- TET. TET.
- OH, IT HAD TO BE
TODAY OF ALL DAYS.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.078
- YEAH, TODAY IS TET.
IT'S TET.
- TET DAY.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.880
YOU KNOW,
KOREANS OWN PINKBERRY.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.049
WASN'T THERE ANOTHER ONE?
SO ALL OF THEM WOULD BE CLOSED?

19:10.149 --> 19:13.520
- ALL OF THEM ARE CLOSED.
- OH GOD DAMN, HE CAN'T
HAVE HIS LAST MEAL.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.356
HE LOVES
THE PINKBERRY SO MUCH.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.857
- YEAH.
- IT'S VERY INTERESTING, THOUGH,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.827
THAT HE WOULD
CHOOSE PINKBERRY
AS A LAST MEAL.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.396
- HE LOVES IT.
- I WONDER IF THAT'LL
CATCH ON IN PRISONS,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.232
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY'RE
ABOUT TO BE ELECTROCUTED.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.634
- PINKBERRY MAKES NO SENSE.
- WELL, WHY?

19:27.734 --> 19:30.370
THE PINKBERRY'LL MELT.
IT'LL NEVER GET
THERE IN TIME.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.605
- WHY NOT?
- THERE'S NO PINKBERRYS
NEAR PRISONS.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.173
WHAT, HAVE YOU
VISITED EVERY PRISON
IN THE UNITED STATES?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.376
I CAN MAKE
AN ASSUMPTION ON THIS ONE

19:36.476 --> 19:38.611
- THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF PINKBERRYS NEAR PRISONS.
- THERE'S PLENTY OF PINKBERRYS.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.780
I'LL BET YOU THERE'S
A COUPLE OF DECENT ONES
NEAR A PRISON.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.516
- NO WAY.
- OH GOD. WELL, WE HAVE TO
GO TAKE CARE OF THIS NOW.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.419
- LET ME JUST
THROW THIS OUT.
- WHAT? NO. NO.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.687
- UH, I'LL TAKE THAT.
I'LL TAKE THAT.
- WHAT IS IT?

19:47.787 --> 19:50.290
NO, IT'S GROSS.
IT'S FULL OF MY SNOT.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.325
- SUZ, JUST GIVE IT.
- LET ME JUST THROW IT OUT.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.527
NO NO, JUST GO--
PUT THE TISSUE IN MY HAND.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.263
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
ENOUGH TODAY

19:56.363 --> 19:57.964
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
LOOKING AT GARBAGE.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.899
- RIGHT.
I'M VERY SENSITIVE.
- YEAH YEAH, I KNOW.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.335
Susie:
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO
TAKE CARE OF THIS NOW.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.505
OH GOD.
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.677
( people chatting )

20:13.012 --> 20:14.647
( sighs )

20:16.849 --> 20:18.818
HEY, LEWIS,
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.787
I'M SITTING HERE LIKE
AN IDIOT FOR 20 MINUTES.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.491
I THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH.
GIVE ME A CALL.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.728
Susie:
HE WAS JUST BELOVED
BY THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.430
- YOU ALL KNOW--
I MEAN THESE KIDS--
- ( speaks softly )

20:30.530 --> 20:32.899
I'M JUST SO GLAD YOU WERE
ALL HERE TO SHARE IT.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.601
Larry:
WHERE WERE YOU?
I WAITED HALF AN HOUR.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.403
YOU DIDN'T CONFIRM.
THERE'S NO WAY I'M
GONNA GO THERE.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.439
I DIDN'T CONFIRM?
WE HAD-- WE HAD A PLAN.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.541
THE PLAN IS
THE CONFIRMATION.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.444
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO--
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ANOTHER PLAN.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.680
THE PLAN IS A PLAN.
A CONFIRMATION IS
A GUARANTEE

20:47.780 --> 20:50.550
- YOU'RE GONNA SHOW UP!
- OKAY, SUNDAY, SAME TIME,
SAME PLACE.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.984
WELL, I'LL NEED
A CONFIRMATION.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.720
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A CONFIRMATION!

20:53.820 --> 20:55.855
- I HAVE TO HAVE A CONFIRMATION.
- THIS IS THE CONFIRMATION
RIGHT NOW.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.925
- THIS IS A PLAN.
- YOU'RE LIKE SOME KIND
OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.993
YOU'VE GOT THE PLAN.
YOU'VE GOT THE CONFIRMATION.
YOU'VE GOT A SUBCOMMITTEE.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.696
- I'VE GOT TO GO
THROUGH ALL THESE LEVELS.
- I'M NOT THE KREMLIN!

21:03.796 --> 21:07.434
I'M JUST A HUMAN BEING
WHO NEEDS TO BE ASSURED THAT
IF I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER,

21:07.534 --> 21:09.502
GET MY CLOTHES ON AND DRIVE
TO A FUCKING RESTAURANT,

21:09.602 --> 21:12.305
- YOU'RE GONNA SHOW UP.
- I AM ASSURING YOU RIGHT NOW.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.040
- YEAH?
- YEAH, THERE'S NO CONFIRMATION.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.608
- FINE.
- SHOW UP.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.678
- FINE, I'LL SHOW UP...
- OKAY.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.212
...BUT YOU'LL REALLY BE
IN DEEP SHIT IF YOU DON'T.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.548
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS CRAP?
LOOK AT THIS.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.750
Richard:
I CAN'T TA--
I'VE GOTTA GET OUT.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.052
- THIS IS GIVING ME THE CREEPS.
- Larry: THIS IS CRAZY. I
KNOW.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.420
A SHIVA CALL FOR A DOG?

21:27.520 --> 21:28.755
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

21:28.855 --> 21:30.923
I ONLY MET HIM ONCE
AND HE NIPPED AT ME.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.959
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.
I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THE DOG.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.761
HEY, THIS IS--
THIS IS-- I CAN'T--

21:34.861 --> 21:36.863
- IT'S LIKE
A "TWILIGHT ZONE"--
- HEY. HEY, VANCE.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.400
HI. HI. THIS IS
MY FRIEND RICHARD.
THIS IS VANCE.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.803
OH, THANKS A LOT.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.939
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
IS HE LIKE A MIME
OR SOME SHIT?

21:47.039 --> 21:49.642
( laughs )

21:49.742 --> 21:51.243
- HE'S TAKEN--
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.413
HE'S TAKEN
A VOW OF SILENCE,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.882
- YET HE MOUTHS.
- LIKE A VENTRILOQUIST
WITHOUT A PUPPET.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.651
- ( laughs )
- HE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST
A PUPPET IN THE CAR

21:58.751 --> 22:01.588
- FOR PRACTICE
WHEN HE GOES OUT.
- I AGREE WITH YOU.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.524
AND I CAN'T HELP
FEELING, VANCE,
THAT I FAILED HIM.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.794
AND YOU'RE
A SPIRITUAL PERSON.
YOU UNDERSTAND THIS.

22:07.894 --> 22:11.097
- YOU DIDN'T FAIL HIM.
- AT THE VET'S I WANTED
TO GIVE HIM HIS LAST MEAL.

22:11.197 --> 22:15.402
HE LOVED PINKBERRY
AND LARRY AND JEFF
WENT TO GET IT

22:15.502 --> 22:17.303
AND IT WAS CLOSED.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.672
AND I FEEL SUCH
A SENSE OF GUILT.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.942
WE TRIED TO MAKE HIS LIFE
THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE...

22:25.545 --> 22:29.115
( echoes )
PINKBERRY.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.824
MMM!

22:37.924 --> 22:41.661
Susie: THE WHOLE
NEIGHBORHOOD LOVED HIM,
DIDN'T THEY, JEFF?

22:41.761 --> 22:44.196
- WHAT? WHAT? THE-- THE HOSE?
- I FEEL SO HORRIBLE, VANCE.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.332
THERE'S A HOSE?
I DON'T HAVE A HOSE.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.701
- Susie: JEFF AND LARRY WENT--
- Jeff: LARRY, I DON'T
HAVE A HOSE.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.737
- YES, THEY WENT
TO GET THE PINKBERRY.
- DID YOU BRING A HOSE?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.639
- NO. WHY-- WHY WOULD
I BRING A HOSE?
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?

22:52.739 --> 22:55.374
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?
- OH, I THINK HE'S SAYING
HE WANTS SOME PIZZA.

22:55.475 --> 22:58.277
PIZZA. WHO HAS PIZZA
AT SITTING-- A SHIVA?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.946
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
- Larry: YOU SHOULD HAVE
SOME PIZZA HERE.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.981
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WENT
ON A HELICOPTER RIDE?

23:02.081 --> 23:04.417
WHY WOULD YOU TELL US NOW
ABOUT YOUR HELICOPTER RIDE?

23:04.517 --> 23:06.786
- Larry: THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
- WHAT'S IT LIKE UP THERE?
YOU COULDN'T BREATH?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.488
- Larry: HUH?
- Jeff: WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND HERE.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.457
WHAT YOU NEED IS
OSCAR'S BOWL ON DISPLAY.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.791
- PEOPLE WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THAT.
- OH, OKAY.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.593
- LET'S GO IN THE GARAGE.
- YEAH, OSCAR'S BOWL.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.562
- LARRY, SHOW HIM
WHERE THE FOOD IS.
- HUH? OKAY.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.699
YOU WHAT?

23:19.799 --> 23:22.034
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ON ME?

23:22.134 --> 23:23.402
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO?

23:23.503 --> 23:26.272
OH, I SEE.
SO LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.541
YOU'RE GOING TO TATTLE,
IS THAT IT?

23:28.641 --> 23:31.310
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING, VANCE.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.582
THERE'S A LOT OF BAD KARMA
ATTACHED TO TATTLING.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?

23:35.682 --> 23:39.318
I WONDER WHAT
YOUR SPIRITUAL ADVISOR
WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.954
HUH? LEAVE HIM
OUT OF THAT?

23:42.054 --> 23:43.756
YEAH? NO, I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE HIM OUT OF IT,

23:43.856 --> 23:47.594
BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES
A TATTLETALE.

23:47.694 --> 23:51.430
NOBODY.
SO GO AHEAD
AND SQUEAL

23:51.531 --> 23:54.534
AND YOU'LL ROT
IN HELL. OKAY?

23:55.535 --> 23:57.436
SO WHAT'S
IT GONNA BE?

24:00.940 --> 24:04.577
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING?
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.321
THERE HE IS.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.790
( chuckles )
YOU KEEP SAYING GOODBYE.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.292
- HEY.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO NEW YORK.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.696
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY.
- YEAH, I WAS SUPPOSED TO

24:23.796 --> 24:27.567
AND THEN THE TRIP
GOT DELAYED AGAIN.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.169
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
I RAN INTO VANCE
AND HE TOLD ME.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.505
BOY, FOR A GUY
THAT CAN'T TALK, HE HAS
A PRETTY BIG MOUTH, DOESN'T HE?

24:32.605 --> 24:34.240
YEAH, WELL,
HE JUST MENTIONED
YOU WERE STILL HERE.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.243
- OH, DID HE? YEAH?
- LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
IN TOWN NOW,

24:37.343 --> 24:40.346
PLEASE DO THE EVENT,
'CAUSE IT JUST GOT
MOVED UP TO FRIDAY.

24:40.446 --> 24:41.748
- IT'S FRIDAY?
- IT'S THIS FRIDAY.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.650
- AW, SHIT.
- IT'S FRID--

24:43.750 --> 24:45.785
I WISH I COULD.
I WISH I COULD,

24:45.885 --> 24:48.154
I'M ACTUALLY
GOING BACK TOMORROW.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.689
- YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO NEW YORK?
- YEAH.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.691
- FOR HOW LONG?
- TWO, THREE MONTHS.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.960
A LOT OF IT DEPENDS
ON JERRY'S SCHEDULE,
WHICH IS CRAZY.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.395
AND BY THE WAY, DON'T--
LIKE I TOLD YOU EARLIER,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.430
DON'T-- DON'T MENTION
THIS TO ANYBODY.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.032
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR BUSINESS IS
YOUR BUSINESS.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.101
- LOOK, WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?
- IN NEW YORK?

25:02.201 --> 25:04.771
- WHERE ARE YOU GONNA STAY
IN NEW YORK? YEAH.
- YEAH, A-A-A HOTEL,

25:04.871 --> 25:07.273
- THE HOTEL... KRENDLE.
- BETTER. BETTER. BETTER.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.709
- YOU KNOW
RENNY HARLIN? DIRECTOR?
- OH SURE, THE DIRECTOR.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.544
- USED TO BE MARRIED
TO GEENA DAVIS.
- YEAH.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.880
I WAS ORIGINALLY GONNA SPEND
THIS NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS

25:13.980 --> 25:16.082
IN NEW YORK DOING
THIS OFF-BROADWAY THING,

25:16.182 --> 25:18.450
BUT THEN I GOT "PANDEMONIUM."
WE'RE SHOOTING IT RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.687
- RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, YEAH.
- YEAH, IT'S BASED ON THE HUDSON
BROTHERS' MOVIE.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.822
- RIGHT.
- BUT RENNY SAID-- LOOK,

25:22.922 --> 25:25.457
IF YOU NEED
A PLACE IN NEW YORK,
IT'S ON 66th AND BROADWAY.

25:25.558 --> 25:28.294
BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
WHY DON'T I JUST
LET YOU HAVE THE PLACE?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.863
HE OFFERED IT TO ME.
I HAD TO SAY NO.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.832
WELL, HE WOULD JUST WANNA
GIVE ME HIS APARTMENT?

25:32.932 --> 25:34.433
IT'S SITTING EMPTY.
HE'S GONNA BE IN MALTA
FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.136
BUT WHY WOULD HE OFFER IT TO ME?
I DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

25:37.236 --> 25:41.540
YOU NEED A PLACE TO STAY,
LARRY, AND YOU ARE GOING
TO NEW YORK, AREN'T YOU?

25:41.641 --> 25:42.709
OKAY, SO IF
YOU'RE GOING TOMORROW,

25:42.809 --> 25:44.543
IF I CAME
BACK HERE NEXT WEEK

25:44.644 --> 25:46.412
AND THERE'S SOMEBODY
THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR,

25:46.512 --> 25:48.514
- IT'S NOT YOU.
- I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN THIS CHAIR, NO.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.050
NO NO. IF I DRIVE
BY YOUR HOUSE, I'M NOT
GONNA SEE YOU OUT THERE.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.152
- I WON'T SEE YOU
ON THE FRONT LAWN.
- NO, YOU WON'T SEE ME. NO.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.888
- I'M GONNA GIVE RENNY A SHOUT
RIGHT NOW, SET YOU UP.
- OKAY. OKAY.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.791
- 'CAUSE YOU ARE
GOING TO NEW YORK.
- I'M GOING TOMORROW.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.828
THREE MONTHS, RIGHT?
OKAY, I'LL TELL HIM
THREE MONTHS MINIMUM.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.697
HE'S GONNA BE
HAPPY TO HELP YOU OUT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, LARRY.

26:08.668 --> 26:11.638
Susie: I KNOW.
IT WAS YUMMY, WASN'T IT?

26:11.738 --> 26:13.606
NO, THE FOOD HERE
IS INCREDIBLE.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.307
HEY, VANCE,
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF DINNER?

26:15.407 --> 26:18.645
- YEAH, I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
- YEAH.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.446
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GONNA BE

26:20.546 --> 26:22.682
THE LAST TIME WE SEE HIM.
THREE MONTHS, WE'RE GONNA
BE IN NEW YORK.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.250
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU
SO MUCH.
- HELLO.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.652
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.887
I just had dinner
with Susie and Vance.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.057
- Where are you?
- DIVINO'S, BUT WE'RE GONNA
GO SOMEPLACE ELSE FOR DESSERT.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.292
OH, I'M TWO MINUTES AWAY.
WAIT THERE. I'LL JOIN YOU.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.394
I have something to tell you.
You're not gonna believe
what's happened.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.129
GREAT GREAT GREAT,
I'LL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE
OF MINUTES.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.865
- All right,
see you soon.
- BYE.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.900
- WHAT? HE'S COMING OVER HERE?
- LARRY'S COMING OVER.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.902
OKAY, YOU GONNA
COME WITH US?

26:43.002 --> 26:44.704
ALL RIGHT.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.907
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TEXT, WE'LL EMAIL.
- TAKE CARE, VANCE.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.876
CAN'T CALL HIM.
WE CAN'T CALL HIM.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.744
I UNDERSTOOD THAT.
HE SAID BYE.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.518
THE RED VOLVO?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.253
AGAIN.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.089
JESUS.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.991
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.441
- WHAT DO YOU THINK? HEY, LAR.
- I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

27:22.541 --> 27:24.844
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS THINKING PINKBERRY.
YOU WANNA GO TO PINKBERRY?

27:24.944 --> 27:27.814
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE NEVER HAD PINKBERRY.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.415
OH MAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET OUT MORE.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.884
- JEFF LOVES IT, DON'T YOU?
- NOT AS MUCH AS I USED TO.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.419
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I--

27:33.519 --> 27:34.787
( Vance shouts )
HEY, LARRY!

27:34.887 --> 27:37.189
I GOT
YOUR LITTLE NOTE.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.925
VANCE? TALKING?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.960
HEY, SUSIE,
GUESS WHAT?

27:41.060 --> 27:43.562
LARRY ATE
OSCAR'S PINKBERRY!

27:43.662 --> 27:45.597
AND JEFF WAS DRIVING!

27:45.698 --> 27:47.800
ASSHOLE!

27:48.701 --> 27:51.203
OH BOY,
AM I SO GLAD

27:51.303 --> 27:54.540
WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK
FOR THREE MONTHS AND NOT
GONNA SEE YOUR FACE!

27:54.640 --> 27:55.742
MMM.

27:55.842 --> 27:58.811
( music playing )

27:58.911 --> 28:01.347
( intercom chimes )

28:13.192 --> 28:15.728
( silent )
