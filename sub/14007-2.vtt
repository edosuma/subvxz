00:03.145 --> 00:05.715
The Bureau's putting together
a case we'll want Patty to take.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.425
We need you to pitch it to her.

00:07.505 --> 00:09.035
Ellen brought this in.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.346
A grand slam.
Infant mortality.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.345
How are you gonna use
this to arrest her?

00:13.385 --> 00:16.684
First, you get her to bite,
and then we'll fill you in on the rest.

00:16.765 --> 00:19.715
Ellen's in counseling
three or four times a week.

00:19.795 --> 00:21.445
People like you and me,

00:21.555 --> 00:22.885
we only have two options:

00:22.925 --> 00:23.975
forgiveness,

00:24.560 --> 00:25.360
revenge.

00:25.441 --> 00:29.441
Let me use the firm's resources to prove
that Frobisher had David killed.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.564
If that company is making people sick,
you have to stop them.

00:32.604 --> 00:33.855
This ends today.

00:34.115 --> 00:36.615
This was hand-delivered.
No return address.

00:36.655 --> 00:39.707
- Why did you send this to me?
- You're the only one I can trust.

00:39.788 --> 00:43.211
If I go public with what I know,
it could bring down an industry.

00:43.605 --> 00:46.047
I don't believe you know my wife,
Christine.

00:46.465 --> 00:47.841
You ready to be reasonable?

00:49.845 --> 00:51.395
Now, will you help me?

01:15.455 --> 01:19.105
So, it seems like you're not
gonna tell me the truth after all.

01:21.712 --> 01:23.062
Well, that's okay.

01:25.245 --> 01:26.295
I lied, too.

01:32.423 --> 01:34.804
<i>6 MONTHS EARLIER</i>

01:40.085 --> 01:41.135
It's Patty.

01:46.395 --> 01:47.195
Hello?

01:48.435 --> 01:50.785
- Is everything okay?
- No, I'm fine.

01:51.355 --> 01:53.448
I'm fine. I need you,
there's been an emergency.

01:56.465 --> 01:57.415
Of course.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.082
She wants me to meet her
at her office.

02:03.585 --> 02:05.296
At this hour?
Why?

02:07.325 --> 02:08.574
I have no idea.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.415
You all right?

02:32.645 --> 02:34.935
I'm fine, yeah.
I just needed some water.

02:34.975 --> 02:36.025
Miss Hewes,

02:36.245 --> 02:38.076
- you're an attorney, aren't you?
- Yes.

02:38.775 --> 02:40.995
- Are you Mr. Purcell's attorney?
- No.

02:41.915 --> 02:44.290
Do you have any idea why he'd ask us
to call you tonight?

02:46.015 --> 02:50.015
I saw him earlier at a charity event.
That's probably why he thought of me.

02:52.004 --> 02:52.954
Excuse me.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.538
I'd like to ask both of you
a few more questions.

02:55.578 --> 02:56.528
All right.

03:00.995 --> 03:03.616
What time did you
drop off your wife?

03:03.996 --> 03:06.645
I told you.
It must have been midnight or so.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.353
I can't be sure.

03:09.045 --> 03:11.095
I had to drop her off because...

03:11.504 --> 03:14.735
it's a one-way street,
and when I came back, I saw that the...

03:14.775 --> 03:17.257
that the...
the door of the house was unlocked.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.647
That's not like

03:19.285 --> 03:20.201
Christine.

03:21.355 --> 03:23.580
And so then,
what happened when you went inside?

03:26.945 --> 03:28.295
I called her name.

03:29.565 --> 03:31.503
And that's when the guy ran past me.

03:31.543 --> 03:34.293
He slammed me up
against the door, and he...

03:35.935 --> 03:37.285
took off outside.

03:39.114 --> 03:41.847
- Is that how you hurt your head?
- It must have been.

03:42.944 --> 03:45.585
- Had you ever seen this man before?
- No, never.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.575
But like I said,
he was shorter than me.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.565
Blonde, stringy hair. Aryan...

03:49.725 --> 03:50.648
or Nordic.

03:51.575 --> 03:52.525
He must have

03:52.675 --> 03:53.475
seen

03:53.805 --> 03:57.045
my wife walking alone and followed her.
I ran off after him, but he...

03:57.085 --> 03:58.235
too far ahead.

03:58.425 --> 04:01.675
I was worried about Christine,
so I came rushing back.

04:03.105 --> 04:04.355
That's when I...

04:06.754 --> 04:09.458
- Right, and that's when you called 911?
- Yeah.

04:11.124 --> 04:13.671
Can you think of anyone who would want
to hurt you or your family?

04:15.875 --> 04:17.524
It's time, Mr. Purcell.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.011
You ready to be reasonable?

04:21.884 --> 04:24.306
- Any grievances that you're aware of?
- None.

04:26.264 --> 04:28.914
I've come because
I need your help, Patty.

04:29.157 --> 04:30.407
I'm in trouble.

04:30.852 --> 04:32.356
I'm being threatened.

04:34.535 --> 04:35.718
Oh, Jesus.

04:40.535 --> 04:41.485
Christine.

04:42.364 --> 04:44.156
I'm okay.
No, no, I'm okay.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.755
He can't have gotten far.

04:47.935 --> 04:50.020
What the hell are you all doing
standing around?

04:50.060 --> 04:52.168
We've patrols in the neighborhood
with the description.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.252
Where is he?

04:53.332 --> 04:55.213
- I need candy.
- No, you need to sit down.

04:55.293 --> 04:56.839
You want me to find him myself?

04:56.919 --> 04:57.882
He's diabetic.

04:57.962 --> 05:00.176
Can somebody please get some
orange juice for Mr. Purcell?

05:00.865 --> 05:04.395
- Anything else you can remember?
- All right, we have to finish later.

05:04.435 --> 05:07.684
I'm advising Mr. Purcell not
to answer any more questions.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.675
- I thought you weren't his attorney.
- I am now.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.446
- Did you ask for this?
- You got juice? All right, all right.

05:14.486 --> 05:15.984
Let's get you to my office.

05:16.655 --> 05:19.256
Drink this. It's orange juice.
Okay, can you hold it?

05:19.296 --> 05:20.947
There you are.
There you are, okay.

Synchro: Gaillots and Salomon.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.829
Thanks to Valpi

06:02.265 --> 06:04.803
He has a daughter who's staying
with her grandparents upstate.

06:04.843 --> 06:07.239
We're gonna need a team there as well.
I'll get you the address.

06:07.279 --> 06:10.121
- No, he'll be staying under an alias.
- How are we on security?

06:10.161 --> 06:11.402
Well, on the way.

06:11.442 --> 06:13.719
- What about a hotel suite?
- I booked him into the Wooster,

06:13.759 --> 06:15.793
and I leaked to a beat reporter
he's at the Waldorf.

06:15.873 --> 06:18.055
Good.
This is Purcell's doctor.

06:18.095 --> 06:20.125
Wake him up.
Get him over to the hotel.

06:20.165 --> 06:23.155
Okay, fine, but Patty,
I'm not sure what we're doing here.

06:23.195 --> 06:25.545
Purcell doesn't need us.
He needs a criminal defense attorney.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.765
This isn't something I can hand off
to another lawyer.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.148
And Patty, the lead plaintiff
from the infant mortality case

06:30.188 --> 06:33.395
- is coming to meet with you tomorrow.
- I can't deal with that right now.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.154
I'll reschedule.
I'll buy us some time.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.857
No, no. Don't reschedule.
Work has to go on.

06:39.945 --> 06:42.155
Why don't you take
first chair on the case?

06:42.195 --> 06:43.045
Sure...

06:43.450 --> 06:45.822
If you think that's the best approach,
given the circumstances.

06:45.903 --> 06:48.974
It's time for you to take lead.
You don't need me. Go for it.

07:25.465 --> 07:26.906
We're moving you to a hotel.

07:41.205 --> 07:43.055
I have to call my daughter.

07:44.425 --> 07:46.242
The paramedics gave you a sedative.

07:46.282 --> 07:49.332
I think it would be better
to wait until tomorrow.

07:53.575 --> 07:54.375
Here.

08:01.175 --> 08:04.109
I know this is a difficult time,
but we have to talk.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.605
The detectives will want to...

08:09.915 --> 08:12.165
interview you again in the morning,

08:12.504 --> 08:14.661
and we need to get
some things straight.

08:22.325 --> 08:24.004
Why did you lie to the police?

08:26.575 --> 08:29.025
You didn't tell them
about the threats.

08:29.995 --> 08:31.245
You came to me,

08:31.625 --> 08:33.764
fearing for your life,
for your family.

08:35.105 --> 08:36.808
They don't need to know that.

08:37.515 --> 08:38.865
Why the hell not?

08:41.255 --> 08:43.600
I don't think you realize
what's going on here.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.772
You were found alone in your house

08:48.345 --> 08:49.795
with your wife's body.

08:49.835 --> 08:51.885
There's no sign of forced entry,

08:52.585 --> 08:53.993
and you lied to the police.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.345
I am going to be a suspect.

08:56.385 --> 08:57.645
You're the spouse.

08:57.685 --> 08:59.498
You're gonna be the suspect.

08:59.578 --> 09:01.416
Patty, I saw the guy who did it.

09:01.615 --> 09:03.165
Who's he working for?

09:04.665 --> 09:06.415
Who's behind this, Daniel?

09:13.695 --> 09:15.545
I can't talk anymore, Patty.

09:22.555 --> 09:24.405
- The car is here.
- Okay.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.548
All right.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.755
Let's get you to the hotel.

09:41.895 --> 09:43.145
This way, ma'am.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.095
Right this way. Watch your step.

10:10.126 --> 10:11.904
How did it go last night
with Mr. Purcell?

10:12.417 --> 10:13.217
Fine.

10:13.257 --> 10:17.158
When I left, the security guards
were posted at his door like you asked.

10:17.239 --> 10:19.289
Can you close that for a moment?

10:24.085 --> 10:26.135
Do you think he killed his wife?

10:26.725 --> 10:29.213
I think it's best not
to jump to conclusions.

10:29.293 --> 10:32.174
But you know him. Do you think he's even
capable of something like that?

10:33.255 --> 10:35.705
I think anyone
is capable of anything.

10:37.855 --> 10:40.005
Criminal law isn't my strong suit,

10:40.665 --> 10:43.815
- but I'm willing to help any way I can.
- Thank you.

10:45.995 --> 10:48.576
The infant mortality case...
I'm concerned.

10:48.616 --> 10:51.861
The plaintiff might go to another firm.
She wants you to represent her.

10:52.015 --> 10:53.865
You are the client liaison.

10:53.925 --> 10:57.925
Back up Tom and make sure the plaintiff
feels supported by the entire firm.

11:05.505 --> 11:08.755
And Patty gave the infant mortality case
to Tom Shayes?

11:09.475 --> 11:10.275
So...

11:11.155 --> 11:13.705
What is Patty's interest
in this murder?

11:13.765 --> 11:15.795
I think Danny Purcell
and her are friends.

11:15.835 --> 11:18.735
I saw him and his wife
at her charity gala last night.

11:18.775 --> 11:21.525
- Well, this is not what we wanted.
- I know.

11:24.682 --> 11:26.645
Is there value to targeting Shayes?

11:27.515 --> 11:29.765
He's been Patty's second for years.

11:30.635 --> 11:32.401
I know he's got
heaps of stuff on her.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.905
You want to do this?

11:36.995 --> 11:37.822
All right.

11:39.164 --> 11:40.455
So change of plan.

11:40.495 --> 11:42.265
We'll let Tom take the case.

11:42.305 --> 11:43.608
If this pans out,

11:43.785 --> 11:45.735
we'll see if we can flip him.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.515
Use him to get to Patty.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.265
Ellen, are you all right with that?

11:50.305 --> 11:51.895
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

11:51.935 --> 11:54.185
This is gonna destroy Tom's career.

11:54.225 --> 11:57.295
- And he could be looking at jail time.
- Tom's a big boy.

11:57.335 --> 12:00.685
If he wants to break the law,
then he can pay the price.

12:14.930 --> 12:17.488
<i>HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?
UNCLE PETE</i>

12:20.821 --> 12:25.121
<i>Former Billionaire Arthur Frobischer
Leaves Hospital</i>

12:38.825 --> 12:40.708
Take it easy.
I'll see you next week.

12:48.345 --> 12:49.395
How's group?

12:50.335 --> 12:52.985
Are you kidding?
It's fantastic. So fun.

12:54.855 --> 12:57.905
It's the only place where I knew
I could find you.

12:59.685 --> 13:01.735
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

13:05.605 --> 13:07.255
So what's on your mind?

13:08.005 --> 13:08.805
My...

13:11.765 --> 13:13.115
I had the chance.

13:14.145 --> 13:15.195
A chance?

13:16.605 --> 13:17.655
To kill him.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.985
The guy who murdered your fiancé?

13:26.545 --> 13:28.767
We were alone in his...

13:29.455 --> 13:32.005
hospital room.
Just the two of us.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.545
It would have been so easy.

13:43.665 --> 13:45.743
But I couldn't do it.

13:46.654 --> 13:50.265
- Why was he in the hospital?
- Doesn't matter. The point is that...

13:50.305 --> 13:54.088
I thought I was there for my fiancé,
but I realized...

13:54.912 --> 13:57.171
getting revenge is something
that he wouldn't want me to do.

14:00.475 --> 14:02.525
Now I just feel like I blew it.

14:04.815 --> 14:07.605
- Then go back to the hospital.
- I can't. It's too late.

14:07.645 --> 14:10.892
They guy has been released,
and I have no idea where he is.

14:12.825 --> 14:14.021
Parsons,

14:14.764 --> 14:17.982
if you really want to find someone,
there's always a way.

14:22.335 --> 14:25.585
Anyway, I just...
I had to tell someone and you were...

14:25.765 --> 14:28.115
the only person
who I could think of.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.717
<i>6 MONTHS LATER</i>

15:11.585 --> 15:12.385
Hello?

15:14.365 --> 15:15.415
Ten minutes?

15:18.575 --> 15:19.825
I've got to go.

15:21.155 --> 15:22.464
Do you always have to go?

15:23.735 --> 15:27.385
I told you there are things in my life
that I can't talk about.

15:30.085 --> 15:31.235
Who was that?

15:32.405 --> 15:34.602
- Leave it, Wes.
- Seriously, who was that?

15:36.535 --> 15:38.485
Don't be here when I get back.

15:43.095 --> 15:46.371
I have to get to the country house.
I need to tell Erica.

15:47.345 --> 15:49.395
Well, this won't take very long.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.075
It's very important.

16:00.685 --> 16:03.130
Sending you the files was a mistake.

16:03.894 --> 16:05.006
What are they?

16:07.785 --> 16:10.633
Our firm was hired to do
toxicity studies

16:10.673 --> 16:12.477
on a chemical compound.

16:12.895 --> 16:13.849
Tetracytophil.

16:15.505 --> 16:19.063
The compound's being developed
commercially under the name Aracite.

16:19.795 --> 16:20.689
Is it toxic?

16:21.345 --> 16:22.295
Extremely.

16:23.665 --> 16:24.818
What is it used for?

16:27.255 --> 16:29.205
Well, they don't tell me that.

16:30.985 --> 16:34.245
Daniel, you're vice president
of your firm, you're head of research.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.638
The firm is obligated to maintain

16:36.975 --> 16:38.925
its client's confidentiality,

16:39.175 --> 16:40.925
even from the researchers.

16:41.045 --> 16:42.295
I get raw data.

16:42.485 --> 16:43.535
I run tests

16:43.815 --> 16:45.565
and I analyze the results.

16:46.325 --> 16:48.759
So you issued your report.

16:49.585 --> 16:51.535
And whoever commissioned it...

16:52.135 --> 16:53.892
pressured my firm...

16:55.971 --> 16:57.521
to doctor the results.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.535
The firm caved,

17:01.018 --> 17:03.148
but they kept my name on the report!

17:05.474 --> 17:07.710
Daniel, do you think your firm...

17:08.565 --> 17:09.915
killed Christine?

17:12.464 --> 17:13.847
They warned me...

17:15.974 --> 17:17.525
to keep my mouth shut.

17:19.714 --> 17:21.464
But they're not big enough

17:21.515 --> 17:22.835
to be calling these shots.

17:23.165 --> 17:24.997
Who would commission
a report like this?

17:25.037 --> 17:27.032
We consult for the energy industry.

17:27.073 --> 17:29.623
These companies are worth
hundreds of...

17:30.675 --> 17:32.439
billions of dollars.

17:32.645 --> 17:35.795
Any one of them could've had
an interest in my work.

17:37.095 --> 17:38.655
Now you understand...

17:40.265 --> 17:41.687
why I can't go public?

17:42.245 --> 17:44.148
I understand why you're afraid.

17:45.035 --> 17:46.859
I'm not going
to the police with this.

17:46.939 --> 17:49.653
That may be the only way
to keep you out of prison.

17:51.625 --> 17:52.775
I don't care.

17:56.425 --> 17:57.867
I was stupid once.

18:05.595 --> 18:08.330
Now, I have a daughter to protect.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.674
What do you want me to do with this?

18:14.005 --> 18:14.855
Burn it.

18:15.275 --> 18:16.638
Shred it, I don't care.

18:18.595 --> 18:20.345
If it ever comes to light,

18:21.605 --> 18:23.455
I'll deny every word of it.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.725
Thank you, Patty.
I'll call you when I get to the country.

18:27.765 --> 18:28.715
All right.

18:29.885 --> 18:31.535
- Michael.
- Hey, Mom.

18:32.175 --> 18:33.125
You okay?

18:33.318 --> 18:34.468
Oh, I'm fine.

18:35.015 --> 18:37.117
Michael, this is Daniel Purcell.

18:39.865 --> 18:41.078
It's good to meet you.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.605
Yeah, same.

18:43.425 --> 18:45.000
I'll be in touch, Daniel.

18:52.755 --> 18:56.677
I know you were expecting Ms. Hewes,
Monique, but Tom is Patty's partner.

18:56.944 --> 18:59.965
- You couldn't be in better hands.
- I assure you, Ms. Bryant.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.642
All of the firm's resources
will be at your disposal.

19:02.835 --> 19:05.145
The insurance companies
need to be held accountable.

19:05.415 --> 19:07.265
They will be. I promise you.

19:07.825 --> 19:10.075
We're going to fight
for all those women.

19:10.115 --> 19:13.110
But you are going to be
the face of this class action.

19:14.005 --> 19:17.118
We couldn't hope for
a better representative.

19:20.975 --> 19:23.025
- Thank you.
- Sure, thank you.

19:26.905 --> 19:29.954
Could I have a moment alone,
Mr. Shayes?

19:31.055 --> 19:32.305
Certainly. Yeah.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.702
I work two jobs, Mr. Shayes.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.259
It would just help so much if...

19:49.695 --> 19:51.525
I could get
a little something up front.

19:52.265 --> 19:53.735
A little extra to...

19:54.206 --> 19:55.320
help pay the bills.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.445
Monique,
that kind of transaction is...

20:00.215 --> 20:03.370
unethical.
It's against the law, actually.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.331
The settlement is going to be
tens of millions, right?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.005
That may very well be.

20:08.365 --> 20:09.809
But in the eyes of the Court,

20:09.849 --> 20:13.165
you'd be getting more money
than the other plaintiffs in this suit.

20:13.205 --> 20:14.923
It's... It's illegal.

20:17.065 --> 20:20.415
I really do want to go with your firm,
Mr. Shayes, but...

20:22.965 --> 20:23.765
But?

20:25.845 --> 20:28.395
I've been approached
by other attorneys.

20:28.455 --> 20:30.564
They said they'd be able
to help me out.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.875
<i>How much are we talking here?</i>

20:35.915 --> 20:37.765
<i>$60,000 would be a godsend.</i>

20:39.825 --> 20:42.075
<i>Well, I think we could manage that.</i>

20:42.475 --> 20:43.425
<i>How soon?</i>

20:44.700 --> 20:46.469
<i>Give me 72 hours.</i>

20:47.136 --> 20:48.040
He said "yes".

20:49.092 --> 20:51.554
It's never a "yes"
until they actually make the payoff.

20:51.594 --> 20:54.083
So what are your instincts? You think
he's going to follow through?

20:54.905 --> 20:56.022
Seemed ready to go.

20:56.545 --> 20:58.592
Has he ever done anything
like this before?

20:59.669 --> 21:00.705
I don't know.

21:01.409 --> 21:03.303
Well, go about your business.

21:03.945 --> 21:06.451
Agent Hawkins will
schedule another meeting.

21:07.559 --> 21:08.646
And...

21:10.124 --> 21:11.104
We'll see.

21:14.224 --> 21:15.705
Put some dirt underneath that.

21:40.994 --> 21:42.909
She wanted to plant
it for her mother.

21:53.942 --> 21:55.609
I've spoken to the police.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.635
There's still no evidence that anyone
else was in your house that night.

22:00.675 --> 22:01.947
Yeah, of course not.

22:06.985 --> 22:08.311
If you get arrested,

22:08.977 --> 22:10.671
you're going to need
a defense attorney,

22:10.711 --> 22:12.731
and this whole thing
will be out of my hands,

22:13.249 --> 22:15.168
but if you let me
pursue that report...

22:15.454 --> 22:16.235
No.

22:17.943 --> 22:19.703
Patty, we had this conversation.

22:21.515 --> 22:25.346
Well, eventually, you're going to have
to sit down with Detective Huntley.

22:25.491 --> 22:26.848
Any time he wants.

22:27.662 --> 22:30.523
He's going to try
to poke holes in your story.

22:31.838 --> 22:35.188
I can't help you unless
you tell me absolutely everything.

22:36.259 --> 22:37.585
What do you want to know?

22:38.320 --> 22:40.115
Start with your private life.

22:42.095 --> 22:46.040
Did you and Christine have any
financial issues, any debts?

22:47.786 --> 22:49.354
A mortgage.
That's all.

22:50.762 --> 22:52.626
Any drug problems?

22:52.666 --> 22:54.332
- Gambling problems?
- No.

22:56.537 --> 22:57.794
Were you having an affair?

22:59.147 --> 23:00.171
Jesus, Patty.

23:00.288 --> 23:03.300
I know this is unpleasant, but believe
me, it's gonna get a lot worse.

23:06.326 --> 23:07.720
Were you having an affair?

23:08.380 --> 23:09.174
No.

23:10.787 --> 23:13.025
- Was Christine?
- None that I know of.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.855
Were there any other problems
with your marriage?

23:17.225 --> 23:18.983
Nothing out of the ordinary.

23:19.563 --> 23:21.604
- Define ordinary.
- Ordinary.

23:21.644 --> 23:23.389
Ordinary means ordinary.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.320
- Did you ever hit Christine?
- Enough of this horse shit!

23:26.360 --> 23:28.449
- What are we talking about here?
- Your temper.

23:30.116 --> 23:31.631
We both know you have one.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.582
I never hit her,
and I didn't kill her.

23:35.838 --> 23:38.344
Well, I can't prove that...

23:39.172 --> 23:43.435
unless you allow me to pursue
who's actually behind this.

23:44.087 --> 23:45.138
Don't you get it?

23:45.852 --> 23:47.087
None of this...

23:47.675 --> 23:48.513
matters.

23:51.195 --> 23:54.768
We're never gonna find out
who's actually behind this.

24:09.905 --> 24:11.931
Don't saturate the center now.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.292
Make sure you...

24:15.737 --> 24:17.632
soak the periphery, as well.

24:23.481 --> 24:25.128
Surprised to hear from you, Patty.

24:25.168 --> 24:28.192
Last we saw each other, we were
on opposite sides of a courtroom.

24:28.232 --> 24:30.588
We haven't always seen
always see eye to eye,

24:31.127 --> 24:33.912
but I called you because you're
the sharpest guy at the EPA.

24:34.564 --> 24:36.184
I got to ask you something, Patty.

24:36.821 --> 24:38.406
How in God's name...

24:38.845 --> 24:40.772
did you get your hands
on those documents?

24:40.968 --> 24:42.688
You know I can't answer that.

24:43.701 --> 24:44.985
Can you explain them?

24:45.937 --> 24:47.915
Well, they're definitely
toxicity studies.

24:48.432 --> 24:51.241
Aracite seems
to be an industrial compound,

24:51.891 --> 24:53.535
but since it's newly developed,

24:53.858 --> 24:56.746
finding out its exact purpose is
going to be next to impossible.

24:57.149 --> 24:58.124
Why is that?

24:58.164 --> 25:01.597
Some company has spent millions
of dollars to develop it.

25:02.297 --> 25:05.213
They're going to keep
a tight lid on its uses.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.967
I wouldn't ask if it
weren't important, Earl.

25:11.127 --> 25:13.763
Look, let me talk to some of
my colleagues in the field.

25:14.481 --> 25:16.034
I need you to be discreet.

25:17.101 --> 25:18.105
Of course.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.685
Thanks for the heads-up, Earl.

25:32.538 --> 25:34.631
I don't know where Patty Hewes
got this information.

25:34.671 --> 25:37.006
I'm afraid somebody in
your company may have leaked it.

25:37.046 --> 25:38.816
We'll certainly look into it.

25:41.567 --> 25:44.085
These are just copies, you know.
Patty Hewes still has the originals.

25:44.166 --> 25:45.259
I understand.

25:47.172 --> 25:49.299
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate the tip.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.799
You know how I feel, Wayne.

25:51.963 --> 25:54.220
A good relationship with
the energy industry is the best way

25:54.385 --> 25:55.975
to promote a healthy environment.

25:57.173 --> 25:58.975
Will I see you up at
Winged Foot next month?

25:59.985 --> 26:01.915
Been working on
my short game all summer.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.356
Hundred bucks a hole, then?

26:04.894 --> 26:07.192
Know better than to give
your money away like that, Wayne.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.498
- Yeah.
- Yes, Mr. Suttry.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.224
Get me a meeting with Claire Maddox.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.503
- It's urgent.
- Right away.

26:30.528 --> 26:31.633
You wanted to see me?

26:37.549 --> 26:38.598
What is this?

26:38.678 --> 26:39.599
A photograph.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.895
Turns out, someone we know
has been keeping a secret.

27:00.989 --> 27:02.039
A sonogram?

27:03.789 --> 27:04.789
It's a boy.

27:12.444 --> 27:13.512
You're pregnant?

27:13.552 --> 27:16.283
Yeah. Don't tell Deb, though,
'cause I'm supposed to be on the pill.

27:19.344 --> 27:20.725
Congratulations!

27:20.942 --> 27:22.226
Thank you. Thank you.

27:23.898 --> 27:25.354
How is Shayes doing?

27:26.010 --> 27:29.847
Any unusual behavior?
Does he seem nervous, jumpy?

27:30.841 --> 27:33.726
No, no. He's on top of the world.
He and his wife are having a baby.

27:34.160 --> 27:34.953
Shit!

27:34.993 --> 27:36.451
Sorry. Sorry.

27:36.491 --> 27:38.241
Pam, you can't do this.

27:40.372 --> 27:42.608
No, you... Not on this number.

27:44.078 --> 27:46.109
Goddamn it!
You take this.

27:47.641 --> 27:49.753
All day long with
with this bullshit.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.039
His wife's leaving him.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.595
Is Tom's meeting
with the plaintiff set?

27:57.180 --> 27:58.532
Yeah, it's ready to go.

28:02.917 --> 28:04.957
If you're having second thoughts,
we can talk.

28:07.804 --> 28:10.009
Just use him to get to Patty,

28:10.424 --> 28:11.645
and I'll be fine.

28:19.621 --> 28:21.465
I've been sitting out
there for half an hour.

28:21.505 --> 28:24.237
In the future, don't demand a day-of
meeting to clean up another shit storm

28:24.277 --> 28:26.246
that you should have been competent
enough to keep

28:26.286 --> 28:28.068
from exploding out of your own ass.

28:28.715 --> 28:29.895
What is it this time?

28:33.932 --> 28:36.905
We have a containment problem.

28:37.172 --> 28:38.023
It's...

28:39.038 --> 28:40.322
legal issues.

28:41.185 --> 28:42.429
It's out of my domain.

28:43.107 --> 28:44.993
By all means, share.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.596
One of my employees
leaked some data.

28:48.873 --> 28:50.637
The documents are extremely...

28:51.712 --> 28:52.607
sensitive.

28:52.923 --> 28:54.192
Does Mr. Kendrick know?

28:55.439 --> 28:57.560
Mr. Kendrick doesn't need to know.

28:57.717 --> 28:59.406
Not if you do your job.

28:59.808 --> 29:02.826
Well, one of us certainly should.
Who has the documents?

29:04.905 --> 29:06.012
Patty Hewes.

29:08.282 --> 29:09.318
Patty Hewes?

29:11.606 --> 29:13.283
I've been thinking about you, Ellen.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.829
You're braver than I thought.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.541
You didn't tell me it was him.

29:33.876 --> 29:34.876
It wasn't.

29:35.999 --> 29:36.815
Come on.

29:37.072 --> 29:40.113
Arthur Frobisher had your fiancé killed,
didn't he?

29:40.418 --> 29:41.868
No, he didn't.

29:42.624 --> 29:43.718
Okay?
Just...

29:44.370 --> 29:45.587
It's not like that.

29:45.627 --> 29:47.870
You said in the group
you were a lawyer.

29:47.910 --> 29:49.911
You spent half a year
working on a big case.

29:49.951 --> 29:52.064
There was a $2 billion settlement.

29:52.636 --> 29:54.716
And then you went and visited
the guy in the hospital.

29:54.756 --> 29:57.038
- Please leave it alone.
- Listen to me.

29:58.094 --> 30:00.091
You do not mess with
a guy like this.

30:02.003 --> 30:03.577
Your firm destroyed him.

30:04.457 --> 30:08.236
When he recovers, a guy with this
kind of power is gonna be vindictive.

30:09.302 --> 30:11.186
And he has resources.
He has connections.

30:11.829 --> 30:13.239
And trust me, Ellen.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.626
I don't care what he did.
You have to forget about him.

30:18.339 --> 30:19.343
You understand?

32:13.372 --> 32:14.434
Thanks, Tom.

32:15.838 --> 32:17.478
I hope you know what you're doing.

32:19.056 --> 32:19.869
I do.

32:22.977 --> 32:24.069
Come in.

32:28.670 --> 32:31.284
This Daniel Purcell
thing makes no sense.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.249
It's one of Patty's crusades.

32:35.410 --> 32:37.135
Do you know
what's really going on there?

32:37.318 --> 32:38.082
No idea.

32:38.919 --> 32:42.003
Are we turning into a criminal defense
firm? That's not what I signed up for.

32:42.214 --> 32:44.507
Stick with me
on the infant mortality case.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.090
I was hoping you would say that.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.591
Well, you did a terrific
job of hiding it.

32:51.922 --> 32:53.348
How old is Megan now?

32:54.202 --> 32:55.652
She's... She's 12.

32:56.764 --> 32:58.686
If she wanted to be a lawyer,
would you let her?

32:58.766 --> 33:00.070
It's too late.

33:00.110 --> 33:03.399
She wanted to be the first
woman Supreme Court justice.

33:03.867 --> 33:06.880
She didn't realize that Daddy
already clerked for one.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.527
I think kids have got
a really basic sense of justice.

33:09.869 --> 33:10.698
Don't you?

33:11.904 --> 33:15.083
And then, as we get older,
it just gets all screwed up.

33:25.907 --> 33:27.199
I don't think so.

33:28.129 --> 33:31.218
I think you get older,
you realize that the world is unfair

33:32.254 --> 33:35.462
and that Mommy and Daddy
can't make everything okay.

33:36.436 --> 33:39.759
If you want justice,
you got to fight and claw and,

33:40.184 --> 33:41.964
and do whatever you have to...

33:43.272 --> 33:44.173
to get it.

33:47.030 --> 33:50.064
You've been working
for Patty way too long.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.253
It's a good thing you
bugged the office.

34:05.581 --> 34:08.597
There's something on one of the tapes
from last week I need you to hear.

34:09.641 --> 34:11.536
It was recorded
in the conference room.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.803
<i>But I've been approached
by other attorneys</i>

34:13.842 --> 34:15.842
<i>who said they would be
able to help me out.</i>

34:16.402 --> 34:17.860
<i>How much are we talking here?</i>

34:18.389 --> 34:20.516
<i>$60,000 would be a godsend.</i>

34:22.297 --> 34:23.943
<i>Well, I think we could manage that.</i>

34:25.020 --> 34:25.869
<i>How soon?</i>

34:27.215 --> 34:28.902
<i>Give me 72 hours.</i>

34:32.356 --> 34:33.906
He's already scheduled a payoff.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.905
I wouldn't have expected that.

34:42.985 --> 34:44.667
You going to let him
go through with it?

34:48.545 --> 34:50.803
It would be
a very big case for the firm.

34:51.706 --> 34:53.471
It could also put you at risk.

35:08.099 --> 35:09.988
Remember,
we got to hear a dollar amount.

35:10.226 --> 35:12.576
It can come from you,
but Shayes has got to confirm it.

35:13.228 --> 35:14.077
<i>Copy that.</i>

35:16.914 --> 35:18.374
You want to put that thing away?

35:20.499 --> 35:22.101
What difference does it make?

35:22.507 --> 35:23.491
Put it away.

35:25.821 --> 35:26.834
Here he comes.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.961
<i>Thank you for coming, Mr. Shayes.</i>

35:41.300 --> 35:42.791
<i>It's good to see you, Monique.</i>

35:43.770 --> 35:46.293
<i>I feel terrible asking you
to do this,</i>

35:48.198 --> 35:50.331
<i>but $60,000 is going
to save my life.</i>

35:53.130 --> 35:54.207
Well, I'm...

35:54.714 --> 35:55.739
happy to help.

36:04.837 --> 36:05.887
Mr. Shayes?

36:12.647 --> 36:13.897
Come on, Tommy.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.911
It's the case of a lifetime,
come on.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.559
I'm going to give you this,

36:26.369 --> 36:29.730
but it's imperative that you understand
you can never talk about this.

36:32.130 --> 36:33.051
<i>Mr. Shayes,</i>

36:33.591 --> 36:35.371
<i>I'm ashamed to even ask you for it.</i>

36:43.059 --> 36:44.662
Hey, now's not a good time.

36:45.699 --> 36:47.123
Who the hell is calling him?

36:50.387 --> 36:51.586
Hold, hold on a second.

36:56.296 --> 36:58.543
<i>I've got to take this and...</i>

36:58.843 --> 36:59.962
He's going to walk.

37:00.002 --> 37:01.929
<i>I'll be in touch with you, Monique.</i>

37:02.193 --> 37:03.063
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:03.777 --> 37:04.595
Shit.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.829
Don't take the infant
mortality case.

37:10.307 --> 37:12.040
<i>I need your help with Purcell.</i>

37:12.559 --> 37:14.512
It's not just a murder, Tom.

37:14.552 --> 37:16.222
There's a much bigger case here.

37:16.951 --> 37:18.529
I can't wait to hear the details.

37:26.765 --> 37:27.746
Game!

37:30.277 --> 37:32.174
Claire, you see me beat this geezer?

37:32.214 --> 37:33.514
Congratulations.

37:34.028 --> 37:36.247
You have a nice,
compact stroke there, Your Honor.

37:36.557 --> 37:38.297
You're just sweet-talking me.

37:38.452 --> 37:39.675
Did you bring the motion?

37:40.947 --> 37:42.505
It's a replevin action.

37:42.545 --> 37:45.923
I'm seeking preliminary relief for
the immediate seizure of property.

37:46.202 --> 37:48.309
- This is ex-parte?
- Yes, Your Honor,

37:48.822 --> 37:50.900
because if the other side
knew I was here,

37:50.940 --> 37:53.814
they would destroy the very files
I'm seeking to recover.

37:53.895 --> 37:56.059
Well, I'm gonna need some
time to look this over.

37:58.823 --> 38:00.188
Patty Hewes & Associates?

38:00.465 --> 38:01.859
This is who you're up against?

38:02.031 --> 38:04.739
Now is not the time
for personal animus, Your Honor.

38:04.779 --> 38:06.446
Take all the time you need.

38:06.486 --> 38:07.792
Give me the goddamn pen.

38:09.914 --> 38:11.031
Thank you.

38:23.255 --> 38:25.388
- Excuse me.
- Hey, you can't go in there!

38:28.774 --> 38:30.226
- What's that?
- A court order.

38:30.585 --> 38:33.195
Hewes & Associates is
in possession of stolen documents.

38:33.505 --> 38:35.398
There are two ways this can go,
Ms. Hewes.

38:35.726 --> 38:37.422
You hand them over to us willingly

38:37.462 --> 38:40.111
or we turn this place
upside down till we find them.

38:43.842 --> 38:45.116
Claire Maddox?

38:52.634 --> 38:53.607
What's up?

38:53.844 --> 38:56.293
Just doing some background
on the infant mortality case.

38:56.550 --> 38:57.652
I'm not taking it.

38:58.217 --> 38:59.964
Why not? What happened?

39:07.195 --> 39:09.150
Monique Bryant...

39:09.949 --> 39:11.142
wanted money upfront.

39:11.368 --> 39:12.494
Are you serious?

39:12.534 --> 39:15.604
$60,000 before she'd
sign a retainer.

39:16.506 --> 39:17.523
What did you say?

39:18.183 --> 39:21.152
I told her forget it.
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

39:22.298 --> 39:24.007
Don't worry, I didn't tell Patty.

39:24.276 --> 39:26.699
I know you're the one
who brought the client in, so...

39:26.779 --> 39:29.348
Thank you, I am so sorry.

39:29.388 --> 39:31.284
This was a really big
opportunity for you.

39:31.324 --> 39:34.022
Yeah, it's okay.
It turns out Patty changed her mind,

39:34.062 --> 39:35.916
didn't want me to take
the case anyway, so...

39:37.951 --> 39:39.003
Did she say why?

39:40.011 --> 39:40.715
Why?

39:41.637 --> 39:42.932
Because she's Patty.

39:42.972 --> 39:44.669
If you figure her out,

39:45.683 --> 39:46.636
let me know.

39:57.122 --> 39:58.314
You screwed me, Patty.

40:00.683 --> 40:03.145
You gave Earl Jacoby
a copy of my work?

40:04.101 --> 40:06.489
He was appointed
by the oil industry.

40:07.725 --> 40:09.867
Jacoby's in
the pocket of big energy!

40:09.907 --> 40:10.611
Think.

40:11.295 --> 40:13.186
I wanted Jacoby
to leak the information.

40:13.226 --> 40:14.330
You what?

40:14.947 --> 40:17.038
It was the only way to expose...

40:17.245 --> 40:19.627
who commissioned the Aracite report.

40:23.187 --> 40:24.430
Do you know this name?

40:26.697 --> 40:28.541
Claire Maddox. I've heard of her.

40:28.914 --> 40:32.678
She's head counsel of the world's
third largest energy provider.

40:33.008 --> 40:34.990
- Ultima National Resources?
- Yeah.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.860
So they commissioned the report?

40:39.285 --> 40:40.016
Yeah.

40:43.661 --> 40:45.245
And they killed Christine.

40:53.479 --> 40:54.479
I'm sorry.

40:54.730 --> 40:55.852
It's okay.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.583
Come in.

41:03.288 --> 41:04.312
I'm taking off.

41:04.352 --> 41:06.625
Just wanted to check
on you before I left.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.253
I'm fine, Ellen, thank you.

41:09.654 --> 41:11.245
How's Mr. Purcell holding up?

41:11.973 --> 41:15.057
Not too well,
which is to be expected.

41:17.229 --> 41:19.479
Did you hear what happened
with Tom's plaintiff?

41:22.166 --> 41:23.342
She wanted a payoff.

41:23.766 --> 41:24.517
Really?

41:25.050 --> 41:26.822
- How much?
- 60 grand.

41:27.143 --> 41:29.247
- Tom turned her down.
- Of course he did.

41:29.856 --> 41:32.022
I want him helping me
with Purcell anyway.

41:36.668 --> 41:39.903
You were the one who brought
in that case, weren't you?

41:40.481 --> 41:43.210
A woman in grief counseling
referred Monique Bryant to me.

41:43.820 --> 41:45.379
And you didn't suspect anything?

41:46.833 --> 41:49.249
She lost a daughter
and a granddaughter.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.177
Monique was devastated.

41:52.386 --> 41:54.069
Well, you have to be careful, Ellen.

41:54.109 --> 41:56.285
Everyone is looking
to play an angle.

42:42.565 --> 42:44.450
Did you tell anyone about us?

42:47.171 --> 42:47.918
No.
