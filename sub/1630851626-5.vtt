WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:03.829
Previously on
B Positive...

00:03.873 --> 00:05.831
I just wish that,
you know, I could find a guy

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
who... who gets me.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.227
Accepts me for me.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.012
You'll find that guy.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.143
Will I?

00:13.187 --> 00:14.318
Absolutely.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.059
And he'll appreciate how

00:16.103 --> 00:17.365
amazing you are,

00:17.408 --> 00:20.020
and how much happiness
you bring to other people.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.500
Drew?Yeah.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.199
I think I found that guy.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.072
Mmm.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.248
Mmm. This is a bad idea.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.424
Why?Because you've had
a lot to drink.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.078
I disagree to agree.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.168
I have had exactly
the right amount.

00:38.212 --> 00:41.171
The truth is...

00:41.215 --> 00:43.391
I love you, Gina.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.872
Gina?

00:46.916 --> 00:48.396
You still there?

00:49.919 --> 00:52.574
Perfect.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.588
[sighs] Good morning.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.111
Is it?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.418
You kind of look
like my daughter

01:10.461 --> 01:12.202
right before
she went into rehab.

01:12.246 --> 01:15.640
How kind of you to say.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.382
Back in the day,
I had a perfect hangover cure.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
Oh, God. Tell me.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.907
Cocaine.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.345
Thank you.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.217
Mmm. This looks good.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.740
Look at that bacon.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.916
Every day,
I ask for soft.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.266
Every day, I get crispy.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.615
Don't tell me. Tell her.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.225
You know, every day, I...

01:35.269 --> 01:36.966
I heard you!

01:37.009 --> 01:39.229
I will talk to the chef.

01:39.273 --> 01:43.755
How can you call a person a chef
when they can't cook bacon?

01:43.799 --> 01:46.149
May I join you?

01:46.193 --> 01:47.324
Please.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.370
[clears throat]

01:51.285 --> 01:53.243
What?

01:53.287 --> 01:55.767
You feel as bad as you look?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.465
Worse.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.642
"Wine comes in at the mouth,
love comes in at the eye.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.165
"That's all we shall know
for truth,

02:02.209 --> 02:04.515
before we grow old and die."

02:04.559 --> 02:06.952
[laughs]
William Butler Yeats.

02:06.996 --> 02:11.609
Did he write one about
dry heaves on the way to work?

02:11.653 --> 02:13.133
Charming.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.181
Ow! Damn it!
Uh, are you okay?

02:18.225 --> 02:21.271
I think I cracked a tooth.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.708
I bet you'd like soft bacon now.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.087
'Course. Uh, when was the
last time you saw a dentist?

02:55.131 --> 02:59.396
Uh, I don't remember exactly,
but when it was over,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.703
I got a yo-yo and a lollipop.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.053
Lorraine, clear
my morning!

03:05.272 --> 03:07.491
This is a pretty
swanky office.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.320
You must be doing pretty well.Oh, I do all right.

03:10.364 --> 03:13.193
Between you and me, most
of the East Coast rappers come

03:13.236 --> 03:15.543
to me for their grill work.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.067
No way.
Yeah.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.329
You want a little bling-bling

03:19.373 --> 03:21.375
in your upper incisors,
I'm your man.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.334
All right, let's have a look.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.206
Here we go.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.947
[sighs]

03:28.991 --> 03:31.428
Ah.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.778
Uh-huh. Wider.Mm.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.259
Yeah, we got a Humpty-Dumpty.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.043
[muffled]:
What that?

03:38.087 --> 03:42.047
Not even Funk Jerry P can put
this tooth back together again.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.266
You're gonna need a crown.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.702
Ugh. Man!

03:44.746 --> 03:46.443
Don't worry.
I'm really good at what I do.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.923
Just ask Cardi B.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.272
You know Cardi B?

03:49.316 --> 03:50.926
"Got a bag and fixed my teeth.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.363
Hope you hoes know
that ain't cheap."

03:53.407 --> 03:55.278
That's about me.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.888
No!
Yeah!

03:56.932 --> 04:00.065
I did her caps, I did
her veneers, the whole deal.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.720
She even gave me
a special thanks on her album.

04:02.764 --> 04:06.158
Okrrr.
Let's do this.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.425
Little bit for my homies.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.122
Question.

04:13.165 --> 04:17.257
For a colonoscopy, do I need
to update my advance directive?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.824
You know, if I want 'em
to pull the plug?

04:19.868 --> 04:22.305
[scoffs] If you can't survive
a colonoscopy,

04:22.349 --> 04:24.742
maybe the plug is
already pulled.

04:24.786 --> 04:28.398
My worst nightmare--
lying in a vegetative state,

04:28.442 --> 04:31.488
my body wasting away.

04:31.532 --> 04:35.492
What's wrong with me that
that image makes me horny?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.452
Can we finish up the game?

04:38.495 --> 04:40.758
My granddaughter's coming
to take me to lunch.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.457
Oh, she's wonderful.
I follow her on Instagram.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.328
Ask her where she gets
her yoga pants.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.765
Sure, that's what you need,
tighter clothes.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.593
I agree.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.509
I want to see her
before she goes back to college.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.337
Wait, didn't she graduate
last year?

04:54.381 --> 04:55.643
What?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.209
Your granddaughter.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.515
You showed us pictures
of her at her graduation.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.125
I-I-I meant... [grunts]

05:00.169 --> 05:02.127
before she starts her new job.
[chuckles]

05:02.171 --> 05:04.304
Can we just finish up
the damn game?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.175
Sorry.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.351
Lululemon.
What?

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
His granddaughter's yoga pants.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.573
I vote you get pink.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.968
Okay, you should be
feeling the gas by now.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.187
No,

05:18.230 --> 05:21.625
you should be feeling
the gas by now.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.149
Okay, that's enough.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.542
[laughs]

05:25.586 --> 05:27.892
All right, now
let's do the novocaine.

05:27.936 --> 05:32.027
Do the novocaine. [vocalizing
to the tune of "Do the Hustle"]

05:32.070 --> 05:34.159
Open up.
All right.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.814
This shouldn't hurt.
Maybe just a little pinch.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.382
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.[groans]

05:39.426 --> 05:40.557
All right.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.385
There you go.
Now, in a few minutes,

05:42.429 --> 05:45.083
you should be
numb enough to...

05:45.127 --> 05:46.476
Oh, poop.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.173
[body thuds]

05:48.217 --> 05:51.220

05:51.263 --> 05:53.309
Jerry go boom.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
Hey. What happened?
Hey.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.926
[slurring]: I don't know.
He just co-wapsed.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.493
Why are you
talking like that?
Oh.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.540
Novocaine.
I cracked a tooth.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.019
How is he?

06:08.063 --> 06:10.195
I don't know.
I'll try to get an update.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.067
[sighs]

06:13.721 --> 06:15.853
[sighs] So, uh,
what happened?

06:15.897 --> 06:18.900
He just collapsed
in his dentist office.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.512
Why are you talking
like that?
Oh, novocaine.

06:22.556 --> 06:23.861
I cracked a tooth.

06:23.905 --> 06:27.169
How'd that happen?Crispy bacon.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.564
[sighs]

06:33.610 --> 06:35.438
[smacks lips]

06:35.482 --> 06:37.440
[exhales]

06:37.484 --> 06:38.615
[clears throat]

06:38.659 --> 06:40.748
Drew, listen,
about last night...

06:40.791 --> 06:42.445
Oh, why don't we talk
about it later?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.621
No, no, now.
[stammers]

06:44.665 --> 06:46.884
I had too much to drink.
I'm so sorry.

06:46.928 --> 06:50.061
These things happen.
It's no big deal.

06:50.105 --> 06:54.588
Yeah, but kissing you
was compwetely inappropriate.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.112
I wouldn't say
"compwetely."

06:57.155 --> 06:59.331
I would never want
our friendship

06:59.375 --> 07:01.421
to be
compromised.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.423
Me, either.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.554
Okay?

07:04.598 --> 07:06.513
You're drooling
a little.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.472
How is he?

07:09.516 --> 07:10.604
Oh, we don't know.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.910
Gideon went to go get
a prognosis.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.564
Why you talking like that?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.566
Ugh, please tell him.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.002
She "cwacked a toof."

07:18.046 --> 07:19.439
Ah.

07:20.962 --> 07:24.182
Did you know
Jerry knows Cardi B?

07:24.226 --> 07:26.707
What?The rapper.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.493
Hey.Hey.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.669
Hi, guys.
Aw.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.628
How you doing, man?

07:34.671 --> 07:36.499
I'm all right.
I feel stupid.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.937
Fainting.
What do my homies think?

07:39.981 --> 07:43.288
Your homies?I'll tell you later.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.465
Your chart says you have
atrial fibrillation.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.641
That's none of your business.

07:47.684 --> 07:48.946
Jerry,
that's serious.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.861
A lot of people have
an irregular heartbeat.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.602
As soon as I get
my meds figured out,

07:52.646 --> 07:53.864
it won't happen again.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.779
Wait, this isn't
the first time?

07:55.823 --> 07:58.129
It's no big deal.GINA: That's ridiculous.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.783
What if you pass out
while you're driving

07:59.827 --> 08:01.698
or you're drilling
my tooth?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.178
GIDEON:
You could have a stroke

08:03.221 --> 08:04.658
and hit your head
and hemorrhage.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.225
Not to mention,
you are in kidney failure.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.489
Yeah, man, you really
shouldn't be living alone.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.707
Oh, my God.

08:10.751 --> 08:13.144
Wightbuwb!

08:13.188 --> 08:16.496
Come wiv at Vawwey Hills
till you're better.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.888
What?

08:17.932 --> 08:19.411
Oh, she said,
"Oh, my God. Lightbulb.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.413
Come live at Valley Hills
till you're better."

08:21.457 --> 08:23.503
Thank you.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.157
I'm not living in an
old folks' home. I'm only 56.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.507
Uh, your chart
says you're...

08:27.550 --> 08:28.812
I'm 56.

08:28.856 --> 08:32.163
I'm too young
for shuffleboard and bingo.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.817
What harm would it do
to at least go check it out?

08:33.861 --> 08:36.167
Yeah, maybe we have
dinner there tomorrow,

08:36.211 --> 08:37.560
and you can
see for yourself.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.866
I promise
you won't regret it.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.564
We have a very vibrant,
active community.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.741
Fine. What time's dinner?

08:44.785 --> 08:47.701
4:00.

08:49.790 --> 08:53.010
Hello, Harry.
[grunts]

08:53.054 --> 08:55.012
Meredith, we haven't
officially met yet.

08:55.056 --> 08:55.709
I'm Drew.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.667
Nice to meet you.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.756
How'd your dinner go with Gina?

08:59.800 --> 09:00.627
You told her?

09:00.670 --> 09:01.932
We're together all day long,

09:01.976 --> 09:04.239
you run out of things
to talk about.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.242
Well, the date didn't go
exactly how I'd hoped.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.418
You should be
used to that by now.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.943
What happened?

09:12.987 --> 09:15.555
Before I could
tell her how I feel,

09:15.598 --> 09:17.687
we ran into her ex-boyfriend.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.123
The broke football player?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.734
I told you that
in confidence.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.300
Bad move.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.696
Anyway, uh,
he was on a date,

09:26.740 --> 09:28.611
she got upset,
got very drunk,

09:28.655 --> 09:30.395
kissed me,
passed out,

09:30.439 --> 09:33.050
and then told me
it was a mistake.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.705
Is that in confidence?
'Cause that's pretty juicy.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.751
MEREDITH:
Hang on.

09:37.794 --> 09:41.232
If she kissed you,
that means something.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.278
Yeah, it means
I'm a mistake,

09:43.321 --> 09:45.628
as was sharing
my feelings with you.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.413
Again, your fault.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.591
"Naomi's Chicken Parmesan."
Who's Naomi?
