Jonah:
All rangas into the goal.
Eat the dog shit.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.100
( screaming )
You fucking idiot!

00:25.200 --> 00:27.867
Fuck!
Jonah:
I got grounded for being
a bully at school...

00:27.967 --> 00:30.700
Rocky:
Hey, listen, get ready
to go to work with me

00:30.800 --> 00:33.434
or otherwise your ass is gonna
get red-hot when I smacked it.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.567
...but me and the boys
went bowling anyway.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.834
Come over here,
you little fuckwit!

00:37.934 --> 00:40.334
You're dead,
motherfucker!

00:40.434 --> 00:41.634
Would I be able
to papier-mâché you?

00:41.734 --> 00:43.500
Why the fuck would
you want to do that?

00:43.600 --> 00:46.367
This hot girl Melody helped me
with my art assignment...

00:46.467 --> 00:48.967
Stop trying to touch
my boobs, you sicko!
I'm not!

00:49.067 --> 00:51.067
Oi, fellas!
Let's go, boys.

00:51.167 --> 00:54.067
...and we tried to hide
from Kool Kris to get
out of counseling.

00:54.167 --> 00:55.600
Sister, I feel sick.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.534
* You are a nun,
you look quite good *

00:57.634 --> 00:58.700
* In your hood.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.967
He made us write
an anti-bullying song

01:01.067 --> 01:03.034
for "Feel Da Beat"
talent competition...

01:03.134 --> 01:05.667
* So don't be a bully,
"moolly, moolly." *

01:05.767 --> 01:09.100
...and if you win
the national final,
you go to America.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.834
Oh fuck.
Oh, that's sick.

01:10.934 --> 01:13.534
That's gun as.
Traditional Tongan
machete, brother.

01:13.634 --> 01:15.800
Sharpest shit out, ay.
And George from the Soldierz

01:15.900 --> 01:18.767
gave Moses
a traditional machete
because we were so brave.

01:18.867 --> 01:21.800
All right, get up,
get up. Go go go.
( tires screech )

01:21.900 --> 01:23.834
( car honks )
Fuck! Sorry, car!

01:23.934 --> 01:27.234
You should feel
my heart right now.
It's beating so fast.

01:27.334 --> 01:30.267
( theme music playing )

01:42.300 --> 01:44.734
( clicking, thuds )

01:45.800 --> 01:48.100
( monkey chatters )

01:50.867 --> 01:52.500
* It's a good day

01:52.600 --> 01:54.734
* Everything over here,
is okay *

01:54.834 --> 01:56.300
* Okay

01:56.400 --> 01:59.967
* It's a good day,
the sun is shining my way *

02:00.067 --> 02:01.900
* My way

02:02.000 --> 02:05.767
* It's a good day,
it's gonna be better
than Sunday. *

02:05.867 --> 02:07.834
We'll see how we go
from there, shall we?
Okay, great.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.867
If you want
to take your seat,
the boys are coming in now.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.267
Ahem.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.267
Boys, what's up, dox?
Sir, what are we doing?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.200
Why have you got
the desks like this?
What's up, G?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.600
Joseph:
Boys, like I told you
before, Jonah,

02:16.700 --> 02:18.867
we've got a couple
of special visitors

02:18.967 --> 02:20.767
with us today.
Israel: Fuck off.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.400
Who are they?
It's the Catholic
Education people.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.100
We have to be good--
Jonah:
Hey, Miss, hi, Sir.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.100
Welcome to Spaz House.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.400
Have a seat. Settle in.
Jonah, just take your seat
and look after yourself

02:31.500 --> 02:33.600
please, son.
I'm just being welcoming, Sir.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.567
All right then.
Very very good,
but sit down.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.800
Joseph:
I've been under review
at Lazarus House now

02:37.900 --> 02:40.000
for-- oh, a few months.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.100
The principal here is a...

02:42.200 --> 02:44.167
just a fucking
major pain in the ass.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.234
He's dobbed me in to
the Catholic Education Office,

02:46.334 --> 02:49.000
'cause he doesn't believe
what we do here is any good.

02:49.100 --> 02:50.800
Sitting up
and listening up.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.000
Joseph's voice: So they're
out here sticky-beaking around,

02:53.100 --> 02:55.667
checking up on me, make
sure I tick all the boxes.
Joseph: Thank you.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.400
Joseph's voice:
It's just a fucking pain
in the dick.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.434
What we've been
doing in this class,
as you know,

02:59.534 --> 03:03.200
uh, in the last couple
of months is we've been
talking about mechanics,

03:03.300 --> 03:06.500
yes, but we've also been talking
about where that can take you.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.567
Sir, what are you
talking about?
Yeah?

03:08.667 --> 03:11.467
Jonah, while I'm talking,
thanks, you guys are
listening, all right?

03:11.567 --> 03:14.034
Could we just do practical?
This is shit.
( snickers )

03:14.134 --> 03:16.700
Jonah, did I hear
a swear word there?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.467
Do you want to go and stand
in the naughty corner?

03:18.567 --> 03:20.367
What's the naughty corner?
What the hell?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.867
What the hell is--
You just made that up
because they're here.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.067
Joseph:
No, no I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.834
Joseph's voice:
Well, I had a word to the kids
about the observation day

03:26.934 --> 03:30.834
and told them, you know,
just to keep it in check.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.500
You know, not to swear
and fuck around

03:32.600 --> 03:34.800
and just to play along
with it for my sake.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.267
So hand one of those back.
Thanks.

03:36.367 --> 03:37.867
We don't even do worksheets.
Righto.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.034
This is gay.
Just wait.

03:39.134 --> 03:41.167
Sir, I need one.
Right, there you go.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.300
It's the first time we got this.
Just a bit of patience.
There's two there, boys.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
I'm not doing this.
No way.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.967
Righto, move that out
of the hallway there, Jonah.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.734
I'm going to trip over it.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.900
Right, what we might do is--
Fuck off, Sir.
Step over it.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Um... we're going
to brainstorm

03:55.100 --> 03:59.567
about ideas of careers
in mechanics.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.100
Okay, so we won't look
at the worksheets
just for a sec.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.000
Anyone know of any careers in--
I've already started
looking at them.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.534
Joseph: Excuse me, Jonah,
I'm talking, all right?
Shut up, Jonah.

04:07.634 --> 04:09.234
Does anyone know any
careers in mechanics?

04:09.334 --> 04:11.167
Sir. Sir, Sir, Sir.
Sir, Sir.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.167
My dad.
My dad's a space mechanic.
( boys laughing )

04:13.267 --> 04:14.767
He works on space stations.
What are you
lying for?

04:14.867 --> 04:16.800
You are so full
of shit, siana.
Fuck up. It's true.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.367
Righto, righto,
that's enough language.
Jonah: It's fucking true.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.400
My dad does!
Language please!

04:20.500 --> 04:23.800
He's got two jobs.
He's a removalist and
a space mechanic.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.267
Righto. That's enough.
You don't even know.
You don't even know, ask him.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.267
Enough. Jonah. Thank you.
Your dad's too fat
to work in--

04:28.367 --> 04:30.400
But they're lying.
Enough!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.600
Right, any ideas?
Come on, just yell 'em out...
I'm telling the truth.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.767
...and I'll wack them up here
on the whiteboard.
Jonah: Sir, this sucks.

04:34.867 --> 04:36.734
Come on, think about it.
Anyone?
Israel: Mechanic, mechanic.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.767
Could we just play
with the motors, Sir?
This is boring.
Mechanic!

04:38.867 --> 04:41.934
All right, okay,
what I want you to do
is just-- then-- now--

04:42.034 --> 04:43.634
have a look
at these sheets...

04:43.734 --> 04:46.034
( Jonah sighs loudly )
...and have a read
of it, quietly.

04:46.134 --> 04:48.034
Jonah: I can't read.
And--

04:48.134 --> 04:50.567
Sir, I'm not doing this.
Because I'm going to be
asking you questions on this

04:50.667 --> 04:52.634
in just a second, okay?
Yeah? Ask away, because--

04:52.734 --> 04:55.934
Ah, fuck, Sir.
( whispering )
Listen, dickhead,

04:56.034 --> 04:59.467
if I hear another
fucking swear word
come out of your mouth

04:59.567 --> 05:01.534
I'm going to hit you
so fucking hard

05:01.634 --> 05:04.100
you won't be able to shit
for a month. Do you hear me?
Yes.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.667
Now just fucking behave.
I'm behaving.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.400
Always behaving.
Joseph:
Okay, everybody.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.967
Hands up those who have
finished reading.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.767
Boy: Yep.
Yeah? Good.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.567
Manu, write "fuck."
We'll talk about
what's on the sheet...

05:14.667 --> 05:16.500
Huh?
You write it.
Write "fuck."

05:16.600 --> 05:18.634
Big sign.
Write fuck.
And, Uh...

05:18.734 --> 05:22.300
then we'll discuss and
come up with some nice ideas.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.634
Anyone?
( boys whispering )

05:24.734 --> 05:26.834
Joseph: Okay.

05:26.934 --> 05:28.434
Sir.
Yeah.
Yep, go ahead.

05:28.534 --> 05:31.434
Sir!
Yep?

05:31.534 --> 05:33.667
I didn't say it out loud, Sir.
I'm not allowed to.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.867
Just put that down, Jonah,
will you, and get rid of it?
( boys laughing )

05:35.967 --> 05:38.934
Put it down and get rid of it.
Sir, this is what you are today.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.634
Listen to me.
Come here.
Come up here.

05:41.734 --> 05:44.467
Ah, fuck Sir,
don't rip my arm off.
Oh, fuck 'em.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.534
Get up here.
Fuck up.
Don't pull on my arm.

05:46.634 --> 05:49.534
Just stand there.
Don't you fucking move.

05:49.634 --> 05:51.734
I'm not moving.
Shut the fuck up.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.967
Right, clearly Jonah can't
be trusted to join in,

05:58.067 --> 06:00.700
so he's going to miss out,
all right?

06:00.800 --> 06:04.900
Now anyone with ideas
about careers in mechanics?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.334
Come on, let's hear them.
Put your hand up.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.234
Yep, go on. What--
( gasps )

06:09.334 --> 06:12.100
( boys laugh )
You fuckin' prick!

06:12.200 --> 06:14.034
Fuck off, Sir!
Don't push me.

06:14.134 --> 06:15.700
Oh, fuck!
I'll fall over.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.800
Get back to your chair!
You nearly knocked
the desk over.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.367
Boy: Oh, Sir!
Get back to your...

06:19.467 --> 06:20.934
You did it, Sir.
You did it.
...fucking chair.

06:21.034 --> 06:23.100
Manu:
Look what you did, Sir.
Jonah: You pushed me.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.067
It's your fault,
dickhead.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.367
*

06:36.134 --> 06:38.934
Jonah, boys,
come over.

06:39.034 --> 06:41.067
Jonah:
What does gayface
want now?

06:41.167 --> 06:42.700
Manu:
He's going
to butt-fuck us.
What?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.700
Kool Kris:
Hey, I just got an email
from "Feel Da Beat."

06:44.800 --> 06:46.967
They've received our entry
and they're reviewing it

06:47.067 --> 06:48.867
for possible inclusion
in the area heats.

06:48.967 --> 06:51.000
Is that it?
So we're not in it?

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
Well, not yet.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.200
Why are you
so excited, Krissy?
Calm down.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.567
Yeah, I thought
a teacher had died
or some shit.
Later.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.067
Tell us when you have some
actual news, Krissy boy.
Later.

06:59.167 --> 07:02.200
Hey, I've got
a good feeling about this.
I'm praying for it, guys.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.467
* Don't be a bully,
"moolly, moolly." *

07:04.567 --> 07:06.334
Shut up, Krissy boy.
You sound gay.

07:06.434 --> 07:08.867
Sir, you're
embarrassing us.
Everyone's looking.

07:08.967 --> 07:12.167
And stop trying to have
a relationship with us, Sir.
We're not homos.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.134
Jonah: Dox, can I
put this in your locker?
( horn beeping )

07:16.234 --> 07:17.134
Mine? Yeah.
Yeah.

07:17.234 --> 07:19.400
All right.
2, 5, 7...

07:19.500 --> 07:22.467
now!
Ah, sucked in,
I know your code.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.334
Break into your locker.
Moses:
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

07:25.434 --> 07:27.300
Show us, show us.
Get it out.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.200
Oh, is it--
Don't let anyone see.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.867
Is it the thing?
Good, dox.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.834
Ready?
Oh, you were
telling the truth.

07:33.934 --> 07:35.200
It's good, eh?
This is mean as.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.300
Don't touch the edge.
It's gonna be sharp.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
Dox, this is sick as.
Is it?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.234
This is legit.
This can kill someone?

07:39.334 --> 07:41.267
Yeah, he told us
it did.
It did.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.367
It's killed someone.
Wait, look.
This is mean as, look.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.367
Yeah, George told us.
It killed someone.
Hide it, hide it.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.167
Quick,
I've got to wrap it up.
Put it away, boys.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.500
Hurry up,
someone's looking.
Careful, put it in.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.334
Oh, bro, that's mean as.
We should all get one.

07:51.434 --> 07:52.667
See, put it up
so it doesn't slip out.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.034
Yeah, we should
all get one.
Jonah.

07:55.134 --> 07:58.100
You're coming with us.
Uh, no I'm not.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.000
Dad said you have to.
Annie's got her mom's car
and she's driving us home.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.667
I'm not getting
in a car with him.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.700
I'm not getting
in the car, mate.
So chill out.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.900
What are you hanging out
with my fat sister for?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.067
Are you desperate?
Seriously, dude.

08:09.167 --> 08:12.367
Have some respect
for your sister.
Have some respect for my dick.

08:12.467 --> 08:15.400
( laughing )
I'm not engaging
in this Year 9 shit.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.134
Jonah, Dad said you have to.
We've got church early
in the morning

08:18.234 --> 08:20.234
and he doesn't want you
fucking around on the street.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.634
Well, I've got plans.
Well, you have to.
Dad said so.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.900
I'm not.
I'll be at church later.
Don't worry.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.100
What's in the bag there, buddy?
You're squeezing it
pretty tight.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.034
Don't talk to my brother.
Stop trying to pick him up.
He's not gay.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.767
It was a simple question, man.
I'm just wondering why
he's squeezing his bag

08:32.867 --> 08:34.667
like he needs
to go to the toilet
and the bag's his dick.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.934
Stop talking about
my brother's dick.
Graydon: Shut up, spaz boy.

08:37.034 --> 08:38.767
Fucking homo.
Mary: Ignore them both.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.700
They've been acting like
weirdoes since this morning.
Let's just go.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.267
See you, gaylord.
Mary: By the way,

08:45.367 --> 08:48.567
I'm telling Dad that you
didn't listen to what I say,
so enjoy your hiding tonight.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.867
Enjoy getting fat, fatty.
( laughing )

08:50.967 --> 08:55.067
Jonah:
Okay, boys, are you ready
to do something brave?

08:55.167 --> 08:56.800
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.100
Ready to do this?
Yep.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.867
Let's go, boys.
All: Fobba-liscious.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.600
( steel drums playing )

09:47.334 --> 09:49.600
( insects chirping )

09:52.867 --> 09:53.967
( Jerome crying )

09:54.067 --> 09:55.600
( door clangs )

09:55.700 --> 09:58.334
Jonah:
Don't cry, siana.
It's gonna be okay.

09:58.434 --> 10:00.200
It's all right, mate.
It's all right.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.034
We'll get home soon.

10:02.134 --> 10:06.634
Okay, all jewelry off.

10:06.734 --> 10:10.467
Into the trays--
piercings, all of it.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.967
What's gonna happen?

10:20.067 --> 10:22.434
Bro, I think
our mom and dad's going
to pick us up, I reckon.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.167
Israel:
Your dad's gonna
get mad, siana.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.834
Jerome:
Why did we even do it?

10:26.934 --> 10:29.667
We're going
to be okay, boys.
We'll be okay.

10:29.767 --> 10:33.167
We'll go home soon
and we'll laugh about it.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.634
Yeah, man,
we'll laugh.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.000
( Moses crying )
I really wanna
go home now.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.500
Hey.

10:42.134 --> 10:44.500
Siana, why you crying?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.100
Gee, don't cry, man.
We're Fobba-liscious.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.300
We don't cry.
Fuck you, man.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.967
You look like homos
when you cry.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.467
Don't call me
a fucking homo.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.967
Don't cry then.
I can cry
if I want to.

10:54.067 --> 10:56.567
Israel: Of course, dox.
No, you're too old
to cry, dude.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.734
Your dick's
too old to cry.
Shut up.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.400
Kool Kris:
The police called the school
and I came here straightaway.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.134
They told me that the boys
would be detained overnight.

11:04.234 --> 11:07.834
The boys decided
that it would be a good idea
to hold up the Bowling Center,

11:07.934 --> 11:10.000
so they've gone over
with a knife

11:10.100 --> 11:13.834
and yeah, it looks
pretty serious.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.067
So apparently Moses went in
and held the knife first

11:16.167 --> 11:19.934
and demanded
the staff hand over some sort
of ornamental bowling ball.

11:20.034 --> 11:24.000
And then Jonah went in
and made some threats
with the knife,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.567
but luckily security
were able

11:25.667 --> 11:28.000
to control
the situation fairly quickly.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.834
But it's armed hold up,
so, you know--

11:30.934 --> 11:33.734
they were all in on it.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.534
I feel really bad for them.
I feel really sorry for them.

11:36.634 --> 11:40.467
They must be absolutely
terrified in there, you know?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.700
So yeah,
I'd hate to imagine

11:42.800 --> 11:44.700
how hard
it must be right now.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.767
( shower running )
Jonah:
Boys, who need the shampoo?

11:46.867 --> 11:49.367
Boys:
Me. Yeah, siana.
Me me me!

11:49.467 --> 11:52.067
Who needs shampoo?
Hey, siana look.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.267
Hey, siana, look,
mohawk.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.367
Like my hair?
I can't do that.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.000
Officer:
Pass that shampoo on, please.
Siana, chuck us the shampoo.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.134
Here here.
I need more shampoo.

12:00.234 --> 12:01.767
I've given it
to you, ay.

12:01.867 --> 12:04.834
Hey, Miss, have you got
hair straighteners
in prison?

12:04.934 --> 12:07.734
Yeah, Miss.
'Cause these boys need
to straighten their hair

12:07.834 --> 12:09.567
otherwise it's
gonna look shit.
I need to straighten--

12:09.667 --> 12:11.967
No hair straighteners.
Jonah: Manu?

12:12.067 --> 12:14.934
What?
Officer:
Knock it off, I said.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.900
( laughing )
You missed. Shame.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.167
Officer: Oi!
Yeah!

12:18.267 --> 12:21.034
Hey, Miss, can you
stop looking at me?

12:21.134 --> 12:22.934
I feel weird with you
looking at me.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.267
Guys, can you
stop talking?

12:25.367 --> 12:27.267
You are in jail.
This is not a joke.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.067
I'm just saying, Miss,
I've got my dick out

12:29.167 --> 12:31.300
and you're looking at me.
It makes me feel weird.
Siana, shut up.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.700
You're gonna get us
in trouble, bro.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.400
Tell her to stop looking
at me. It's weird.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.700
Yeah, I know.
Hard, ay.
Moses, talk for once.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.300
What are you doing?
Man, he's probably
jerking off, ay.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.634
( boys laugh, jeer )

12:42.734 --> 12:44.400
Yay, Moses.
Moses!

12:44.500 --> 12:47.234
Jerk it!
Leave him
alone, boys.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.734
Miss, you definitely
have to go now.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.634
My brother's jerking off.
Look, shut your mouths,

12:51.734 --> 12:54.867
do as your told.
This is your last warning,
all right?

12:54.967 --> 12:56.700
( boys chatter )

13:09.967 --> 13:13.067
You've got the use
of the facilities for the next
couple of hours before bed.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.334
No running, no swearing,
no harming others.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.234
This is gay, boys.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.367
Oh shit.
Sit down, sit there.

13:25.834 --> 13:26.900
Fellas.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.567
Hey.
I know you, ay?

13:28.667 --> 13:30.467
You know someone I know.
Do you know Kylie?

13:30.567 --> 13:33.500
Uh, no.
Yeah, I'm sure
you know her, mate.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
She said she knows you.
No, I don't know her.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.434
Yeah, where are you from?
Summer Heights.

13:37.534 --> 13:39.134
Yeah, that's where Kylie's from.
I know her too.

13:39.234 --> 13:41.300
She was in not long ago
having a visit with one
of the brother boys.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.534
You know her, ay?
Uh, no,

13:43.634 --> 13:46.267
I've never heard of her.
Nah, I'm pretty sure
you know her.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.000
She said she knows you.
Do you boys know her?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.867
I'm not talking to them.
I'm talking to you.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.334
What?
You know her, ay?

13:53.434 --> 13:55.034
Oh, yeah, I do.
I know Kylie.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.467
( inmates laugh )

13:57.567 --> 13:59.600
Wrong answer.
You're a pussy, bruz.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.400
Fucking pussy.
All you boys are pussies.

14:02.500 --> 14:06.400
I can tell.
Fobs are always pussies.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.700
Fuck up, Jarrod.
All Abo's are dumb fucks,
you know that?

14:08.800 --> 14:10.567
Inmates: Ooooh.
You want to get cut,
you racist dog?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.700
Come here,
you racist fuck.
( bangs ) Hey!

14:12.800 --> 14:15.334
If you can't speak
nicely to the new inmates,
just shut your mouth.

14:15.434 --> 14:17.700
( door creaks )
Man: Jonah and Moses Takalua.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.234
Come with me, boys.
You've got people to see.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.000
Officer:
I'll take this one, thanks.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.734
Later, siana.
Take care, siana.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.434
Fobba-liscious.
Fobba-liscious.

14:31.267 --> 14:32.900
Kool Kris:
Hey, Jonah.
Sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.200
How are you?
Good.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.667
Aunty.
Moses.
Good to see you.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.634
Um, take a seat please.
Yeah.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.400
Thank you.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.500
How are you, guys?
Jonah: Good.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.267
Moses: Good.
You guys all right?

14:47.367 --> 14:49.467
Yeah. We got
new track suits.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.367
Kool Kris:
Yeah, they look great.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.334
Nah, these are
horry as, Sir.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.400
They're shit.
Look at my shoes.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.934
Look, Velcros.

14:58.034 --> 14:59.234
Mmm, nice.
Gay as.

14:59.334 --> 15:01.367
That's okay.
Nah. They're gay, Sir.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.967
Well, so I spoke
to the legal aid lawyer

15:04.067 --> 15:08.100
and he reckons that we can
have the parole hearing
in about six weeks.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.700
But because of your
previous convictions, Jonah,

15:10.800 --> 15:13.500
you might be in here
for a while.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.667
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Yes Sir.

15:15.767 --> 15:18.334
Okay. Now, Moses, you've got
a criminal record too,

15:18.434 --> 15:20.834
but because of your age
and your learning difficulties,

15:20.934 --> 15:23.600
the lawyer said that we can
try and get you out sooner.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.667
All right?
Yes Sir.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.534
But, Jonah, you might be
in here for a while.

15:29.634 --> 15:31.667
Aunty, don't cry!

15:31.767 --> 15:34.934
I don't even care
about being in here.
It doesn't matter.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.167
Your dad is
very very angry.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.934
He said to throw
the key away.

15:41.034 --> 15:42.134
Well, he's a homo.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.967
Kool Kris:
Come on, Jonah.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.634
Your aunty's upset,
all right?

15:45.734 --> 15:47.567
Let's try and lay off
those kind of comments.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.067
He is one though.

15:49.167 --> 15:51.067
I'd shut up
if I were you.
Who asked you, fatty?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.534
What are you
doing here anyway?

15:52.634 --> 15:54.467
I was forced to come here
and see your face.

15:54.567 --> 15:56.334
Well, go home.
Get the train home.

15:56.434 --> 15:58.300
I'm here to support Aunty.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.067
Look anyway,
your dad said he really
wanted to be here,

16:01.167 --> 16:04.400
but because of work
and it's a long drive,
he decided not to come.

16:04.500 --> 16:08.567
Okay? But he does care
about what's going on.
Whatever.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.367
Mary:
Don't say whatever.
Leave him alone.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.834
Say sorry for bringing
shame to the family.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.734
Say sorry for bringing
shame to my dick.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.534
( boys laugh )

16:17.634 --> 16:20.334
Jonah, none of us are
finding this funny, okay?

16:20.434 --> 16:23.100
It is funny, Sir.
Get a sense of humor.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.867
Okay, can you tell me more
about what happened?

16:25.967 --> 16:28.100
Why did you want
the bowling ball?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.634
'Cause it's worth heaps.

16:29.734 --> 16:32.634
If you melt it down
it's worth $10,000.

16:32.734 --> 16:35.100
And I was going to use
the money to take Moses

16:35.200 --> 16:37.067
to Los Angeles
for his record deal.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.400
If it's worth that much,
why is it in a bowling alley?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.467
Jonah:
Shut up, fatty.
You don't even know.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.067
Shouldn't it be in, like,
a museum or some shit?
You don't know.

16:44.167 --> 16:47.234
Hey, kids, please be
nice to each other.

16:47.334 --> 16:49.200
Tell fatty to shut up then.
Mary: Shut up.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.234
You don't even
know anything.
You don't even go bowling.

16:51.334 --> 16:53.900
Okay, so who gave you
the knife?
Jonah: George.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.334
From the Soldierz.

16:55.434 --> 16:58.034
George Kakalukai.
Kool Kris:
Yeah, right.

16:58.134 --> 16:59.600
You know those guys
are trouble, right?

16:59.700 --> 17:01.767
You don't even
know anything, Sir.

17:01.867 --> 17:04.634
You don't know
anything about being brave,
because you're too gay.

17:04.734 --> 17:08.600
Those guys have done time.
You realize that, right?
So?

17:08.700 --> 17:11.867
They drive around
in probably stolen cars

17:11.967 --> 17:14.200
looking to recruit
good boys like you.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.834
You want to try and stay
away from them, trust me.

17:17.934 --> 17:19.834
You don't want
to get involved.

17:19.934 --> 17:23.634
Sir, if they weren't brave,
then why do they have
their tattoos then?

17:23.734 --> 17:26.200
They've got full tattoos
on their arm and when I'm older

17:26.300 --> 17:30.100
and I get my full tattoo
in Tonga, then I'm gonna be
as tough and brave as them.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.134
You are so embarrassing
right now.

17:33.234 --> 17:34.667
Time's up.
Wrap it up please.

17:34.767 --> 17:37.567
Okay. Well,
we can talk about that--
more about that later.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.334
Now please.
Yeah sure.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.767
But I do have
some good news.
What?

17:41.867 --> 17:43.734
I had a call
from "Feel Da Beat"

17:43.834 --> 17:46.500
and you guys have been selected
to perform in the area heats.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.300
Oh yeah!
Kool Kris:
Six weeks--

17:48.400 --> 17:50.467
Guys.
We'll perform in front
of a real audience?

17:50.567 --> 17:52.600
Yep.
Oh yes, Sir.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.367
We got to get
you guys out.
To win it!

17:54.467 --> 17:56.500
But me and the boys can
practice in here, in jail.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.134
We can practice.
Well, the thing is--
the thing is

17:58.234 --> 17:59.867
they haven't got
as many convictions as you,

17:59.967 --> 18:01.334
so they're being
released tonight.

18:01.434 --> 18:03.000
Jonah:
So they're going
and I'm staying?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.534
It will just be
you and Moses.
Boys, boys!

18:05.634 --> 18:08.067
Guess what?
I just found out from Sir.
I've got to stay six weeks,

18:08.167 --> 18:11.734
but we got in "Feel Da Beat."
We're going to perform in
front of an audience.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.300
Boys, practice.
Make sure you practice.
Come on.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.734
Israel: You too, Moses.
Fuck off. I'm saying
goodbye to them.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.434
Look after your brother, bro.
Fobba-liscious, boys.
Fobba-liscious.

18:19.534 --> 18:20.667
Love you, siana!

18:20.767 --> 18:21.834
*

18:21.934 --> 18:24.534
( chattering )

18:26.334 --> 18:28.100
Boy:
Hey, look who's here,
look who's here.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.734
Who are these fuckers?

18:29.834 --> 18:32.400
Jarrod:
That's pussy one and his
little brother pussy two.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.634
From Summer Heights.
They know Kylie.

18:34.734 --> 18:37.100
Is that a Tongan tattoo?
Yeah, siana.
Wanna have a look?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.934
Fuck you.
I'm not your siana.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.067
I don't give a fuck
about your tattoo.
Guard: Just keep walking.

18:41.167 --> 18:43.267
Keep walking,
you dumb fuck.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.767
Oi, you monkey dog.
Keep walking.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.034
Officer:
Jonah Takalua, 202.

18:48.134 --> 18:51.600
Moses Takalua, 203.
You're lucky that we had
two next to each other.

18:51.700 --> 18:57.034
Lights out in five.
No talking after
lights out.

18:57.134 --> 18:59.867
Jarrod: Hey, Miss Cooper.
All right, I do
not need any crap

18:59.967 --> 19:02.734
from you tonight,
I can assure you.
Nah, I'm hungry.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.367
Officer Leonard usually lets me
and the boys have leftovers.
Hey, Moses.

19:05.467 --> 19:08.100
Moses, come in here.
Cooper: Well, I'm not
Officer Leonard.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.767
The dinner looked like shit.
Now I'm hungry.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.700
Cooper:
I can't force you to eat it.
That's your problem.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.167
Jarrod: I wanna eat now but--
Cooper:
Well, enjoy that thought

19:14.267 --> 19:17.567
because you're
not going to.
She won't even care.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.267
We save space anyway.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.934
Jarrod:
You suck, Miss.

19:22.034 --> 19:23.734
Cooper:
Right, lights out.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.100
Jarrod: Nah, it's too early.
You said five minutes.
( groans )

19:26.200 --> 19:27.734
I'm in charge,
what I say goes.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.134
And I said
I wanted no cheek
from you.

19:30.234 --> 19:32.700
Lights out.
It's not cheek.
I'm just standing up
for my prison rights, Miss.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.134
( Jonah/Moses singing softly )
* I feel sad, I feel pain

19:35.234 --> 19:37.734
* When you call me
that name *

19:37.834 --> 19:42.467
* I'm a person
just like you *
Boy: Shh, shut up.

19:42.567 --> 19:46.334
* Don't be a bully,
I feel sad, I feel pain *

19:46.434 --> 19:49.300
* When you call me
that name *

19:49.400 --> 19:53.267
* I'm a person
just like you *

19:53.367 --> 19:55.934
* Don't be a bully

19:56.034 --> 19:58.534
* Hey, bullies,
listen up-- *

19:58.634 --> 20:02.200
Hey, what's going on here?
We're not sharing cells. Out.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.834
Miss, we do this at home.

20:04.934 --> 20:08.334
It saves space.
That means you get
a free cell next door.

20:08.434 --> 20:10.834
It doesn't work that way.
Come on. Move.

20:12.867 --> 20:15.334
Moses Takalua?
Yeah, he's--

20:15.434 --> 20:17.300
he's being released.
Cooper: Oh, you're
a lucky young man.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.034
Come on.
*
I don't want to go.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.900
Now come on, guys.
Let go of him.
He's not going!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.200
No! Will you
let go of him?
He's not going anywhere.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.300
Let go.
Stop mucking around.
Fuck off! Do the link.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.700
*
Do the Takalua link.
Do the link.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.734
Hold on. They won't
be able to break it.
Stop being so silly.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.334
I don't wanna go.
Don't you fucking
touch him!

20:33.434 --> 20:35.467
Jonah:
Hold on tight.
Let go!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.334
Moses!
Moses:
No, I don't want to go.

20:37.434 --> 20:39.367
I don't want him
to go, Miss!
*
No no.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.234
Jonah:
Fuck off me!
Fuck off!

20:41.334 --> 20:43.900
Get in there.
Moses! Miss!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.834
Miss, I want him to stay here!
( keys jangle, lock clicks )

20:46.934 --> 20:51.134
Miss.
Miss, I want him to stay
with me, you fat bitch.

20:51.234 --> 20:55.300
Fuckin'--
( men singing
in foreign language )

21:30.434 --> 21:32.734
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

21:32.834 --> 21:35.467
Not with you.
You're a fat bitch.

21:35.567 --> 21:38.400
I will be a bitch
if you speak to me
like that.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.334
Shut up, ranga.

21:40.434 --> 21:42.834
Look, behave yourself
and we'll get along fine,
all right?

21:42.934 --> 21:45.800
Get along with my dick.
Jarrod:
Shut up, Fob! Go to sleep!

21:45.900 --> 21:49.967
Fuck up, Abo!
All right, someone's
getting a flogging tomorrow!

21:50.067 --> 21:52.267
Yeah, you by me.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.300
Quiet!

21:54.400 --> 21:57.700
Don't go there.
You don't go there.

21:59.434 --> 22:02.134
( sighs )

22:02.234 --> 22:03.734
I was listening to you
and your brother

22:03.834 --> 22:05.634
singing before.
You've got really
good voices.

22:05.734 --> 22:07.967
Shouldn't have been
listening to us, Miss.

22:08.067 --> 22:09.634
Well--
It's private singing.

22:09.734 --> 22:13.234
I'm very sorry,
but I happened
to overhear it.

22:13.334 --> 22:15.300
You sing in church?

22:15.400 --> 22:17.567
My brother's good.
I'm not that good.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.334
I think you're
pretty good too.
Nah,

22:20.434 --> 22:23.267
my brother's the best.
I'm gonna go to America

22:23.367 --> 22:25.667
to get a record deal
for him.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.300
He's gonna make
lots of money.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.400
I'm different.
I'm better at rapping

22:30.500 --> 22:34.200
and dancing
and telling jokes.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.634
What's your name, Miss?

22:38.734 --> 22:40.000
Officer Cooper.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.634
No, your first name.
Therese.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.300
Therese, good name.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.667
My mom's name
was Theresa.

22:48.767 --> 22:51.134
That's your name
with a "ah."

22:51.234 --> 22:53.200
Mmm.
She died but--

22:53.300 --> 22:55.234
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

22:55.334 --> 22:56.934
No, it was ages ago.

22:57.034 --> 22:59.100
I was six,
so it doesn't matter.

23:01.367 --> 23:04.734
Do you like your job?
Yes, I do.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.667
Do you want me
to tell you a joke?

23:07.767 --> 23:11.434
( chuckles )
Well, I'm not normally
one for comedy,

23:11.534 --> 23:14.034
so it'd better be good.
Ah, you should--

23:14.134 --> 23:16.600
Miss, my jokes are good.
I just make them up.

23:16.700 --> 23:20.334
Why did the boy--
why did the boy
eat the poo?

23:20.434 --> 23:23.067
'Cause he thought
it was a chocolate bar.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.500
Miss?
That's
not even funny.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.700
It is, Miss.
Jarrod: Shut up, mate.
It's the middle of the night.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.200
Go to bed.
Oi, be quiet.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.367
Shut the fuck up, Abo.
Hey.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.267
We better be quiet,
mate, all right?

23:34.367 --> 23:36.034
Miss, one more joke.
*

23:36.134 --> 23:39.000
What did the prison cell
say to the door?

23:39.100 --> 23:41.800
Marry my dick.
( chuckles )

23:41.900 --> 23:46.634
Don't give up
your day job, mate.

23:46.734 --> 23:48.767
Yeah well, look,
I'll show you around
tomorrow, okay?

23:48.867 --> 23:51.700
And we'll get you
all settled in.
Don't even bother, Miss!

23:51.800 --> 23:54.500
I'm only staying here
one night. I'm probably
going home tomorrow.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.667
Cooper:
Yeah, that's what
they all say, Jonah.

23:56.767 --> 23:58.534
Night, mate.
Good night.

23:58.634 --> 24:01.767
Sorry for calling you
a fat bitch.

24:01.867 --> 24:03.600
And a ranga.

24:03.700 --> 24:07.067
*

24:12.267 --> 24:13.467
*
Juvi-liscious!

24:13.567 --> 24:16.000
Yeah, I love juvie.
It's mean as.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.867
Why don't all you
chaboriginies chiss off?

24:17.967 --> 24:20.500
( laughs )
Yeah, Jonah's
settled in extremely well.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.534
A little bit too well, actually.
Miss, could you
shampoo my balls for me?

24:23.634 --> 24:25.967
Oh, I wouldn't exactly say
that I've missed him.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.234
I've certainly noticed
he's not there.

24:27.334 --> 24:29.367
Jonah wants to ask you
a question.

24:29.467 --> 24:33.134
Boys, your dad's are here.
Cooper: Jonah is loving
having his dad Rocky here.

24:33.234 --> 24:34.967
Happy Father's Day.
Happy Dickhead Day.

24:35.067 --> 24:37.434
Look, I've got
a surprise for you.
What the fuck am I doing here?

24:37.534 --> 24:40.000
What the fuck, Sir?
I didn't do anything!
I thought I'd come and see

24:40.100 --> 24:42.134
if you'd learned
you fucking lesson, ay?

24:42.234 --> 24:43.700
Hey, what's that for?
"Feel Da Beat,"

24:43.800 --> 24:46.167
next week with my boys.
You ain't getting out, bruz.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.667
You're in here
for a while.
( clamoring )

24:49.967 --> 24:51.734
Get off me!
Get off of me!

24:53.034 --> 24:55.700
( theme music playing )
