WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.570
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.604 --> 00:04.572
Hey, Mom.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.176
Mom? Mommy?

00:08.208 --> 00:10.878
There's some money stuff
we're gonna have to
talk to you about.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.680
-So you're telling me I'm broke?
-Hospital bills.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.715
Pretty much sucked up
all the money.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.419
-I don't think
I can do this.
-Yes, you can.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.855
So, you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

00:21.888 --> 00:23.390
BOTH: Okay.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.493
We're like supervillains.
(cackling)

00:26.527 --> 00:28.728
Why are you always around
when I'm miserable?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.530
'Cause that's when
you're alone, I reckon.

00:30.564 --> 00:34.101
I'm not one for crowds
myself these days.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.072
-Me neither.
-That works out nicely then.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.307
Buffy, what is it?

00:41.609 --> 00:46.347
Angel.
He, he needs to see me.
I, I have to see him.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.182
Well, you'll leave
for LA tomorrow.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.917
I have to go now.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.024
-Hello?
-WILLOW: Buffy?

00:58.057 --> 01:00.228
Oh. Yep, it's me,
and I brought dinner.

01:00.261 --> 01:03.930
Deep-fried chicken parts.
Hope you're... hungry.

01:03.963 --> 01:07.400
-You already ate.
-No.

01:08.335 --> 01:11.070
Well, uh, yes, obviously.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.972
Uh, we didn't know when
you'd be coming back.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.477
It's okay.
More for me.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.382
I don't know
about everybody else,
but I would love some chicken.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.817
-Yes, as would I.
-I'll take a drumstick.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.021
I'm a breast girl myself.
But then again, you knew that.

01:33.826 --> 01:36.996
-So.
-What "so"?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.133
So how was it?

01:40.433 --> 01:43.137
Seeing Angel?
Him seeing you?

01:43.170 --> 01:45.272
Was it weird?

01:46.873 --> 01:51.512
Um, it was... intense.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.781
-Well, if you want
to talk about it--
-I don't.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.618
It's not important.
Past.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.954
I'd just rather
keep this one to myself,
if that's okay.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.525
-Sure. Whatever.
-GILES: Buffy, um,

02:04.557 --> 02:07.628
there was some discussion
in your absence...

02:07.661 --> 02:11.098
about, um, what, what
you're gonna do now.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.366
You know, uh,
your plans.

02:13.401 --> 02:17.538
Oh. Um,
I've been giving that
a lot of thought, actually.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.606
And I think
I've figured it out,
what I should do.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.210
-Good. That's good.
-Yeah, I figure,

02:22.242 --> 02:24.777
if I hold off
paying the plumber,
I can pay the utility bill.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.181
And then I can wait
to re-shingle the roof
until we get the refund back--

02:27.215 --> 02:32.719
-No, I meant with your life.
-Oh. Life plans. Um--

02:32.752 --> 02:37.057
Wow.
I have no idea.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.995
I guess, um--
Well, I, I left school,

02:42.028 --> 02:45.365
you know, when Mom got sick,
but I always figured
I'd go back.

02:45.399 --> 02:50.371
And then she, um--
So I was thinking
about reenrolling,

02:50.403 --> 02:54.307
but, um, I missed
the registration cutoff,
busy being dead and all.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.909
Well, if it's too late
for late registration,

02:56.944 --> 03:00.213
and too early for early,
you can always come
to classes with Tara and me.

03:00.247 --> 03:04.384
Right. You, you can audit for
the rest of the semester
until registration.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.990
Audit. I, I guess
I could do that.

03:10.022 --> 03:14.961
Yeah, that sounds
like a good plan.
What do you think, Giles?

03:16.597 --> 03:19.667
The Slayer always knows
what she's doing.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.068
Sharp, decisive.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.837
Always with a plan.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.740
We're never gonna become
the crime lords
of Sunnydale...

03:26.774 --> 03:28.841
with her always
one step ahead of us.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.110
WARREN:
Well, that's why we're
throwing these tests at her,

03:31.144 --> 03:34.615
seeing which one of us
can shake her up the most,
maybe find a weakness or two.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.586
-She's ready.
-Sweet. Run me through it.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.925
We got nine high-resolution
surveillance cameras hooked in,

03:44.957 --> 03:47.260
super-wide angle,
infrared, auto-iris,

03:47.295 --> 03:49.362
plus six types of
audio matrix monitoring...

03:49.396 --> 03:51.699
that's filtered
through a dual quad
DVR system and--

03:51.731 --> 03:54.634
Yeah, yeah, fine.
Just tell me,

03:54.668 --> 03:57.405
Are you sure with all this stuff
that we'll be able
to watch Buffy...

03:57.437 --> 03:59.539
-without her noticing us?
-Absolutely.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.643
I mean,
she'll never even know--

04:02.675 --> 04:06.813
-What the hell is that?
-Death Star, dude.
Wicked, huh?

04:06.847 --> 04:10.082
Thermal exhaust port's
above the main port,
numb nuts.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.985
For your information,
I'm using the Empire's
revised designs...

04:13.020 --> 04:15.087
-from Return of the Jedi .
-That's a flawed design!

04:15.122 --> 04:19.660
Hey! Okay, the thing is,
since we're messing
with the Slayer,

04:19.692 --> 04:22.262
who could pummel
the three of us into
a sludgy substance,

04:22.295 --> 04:25.132
it might be a good idea
for us to not
draw attention to ourselves!

04:25.165 --> 04:26.367
Mm-hmm.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.670
I could paint over it
if you want.

04:29.702 --> 04:33.606
Yeah, well, do that!
Because this time tomorrow
the games begin,

04:33.641 --> 04:36.776
and the Slayer
will never even know
what hit her.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.283
(theme music playing)

05:37.670 --> 05:39.372
BUFFY:
This is gonna be great.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.808
I, I thought it might be
a little weird being back.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.045
I mean, it is weird,
but like a good kind of weird.

05:45.077 --> 05:48.548
There's the teacher, Mike.
You'll like Mike.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.018
You call your teacher Mike?

05:51.050 --> 05:53.521
Boy, school sure has
changed since my day.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.923
Social construction
of reality.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.725
Who can tell me
what that is? Rachel?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.228
A concept involving a couple
of opposing theories,

06:01.261 --> 06:03.396
one stressing
the externality
and independence...

06:03.430 --> 06:05.197
of social reality
from individuals.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.901
And the flip side?
Steve?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.903
Well, that each
individual participates...

06:09.937 --> 06:11.439
fully in the construction
of his or her own life.

06:11.471 --> 06:15.375
Good. And who can
expand on that? Chuck?

06:15.408 --> 06:18.545
Wil, I'm not
following this too well.
Oh.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.548
Oh, the trick is
to get in the rhythm.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.184
Kinda go with the flow.

06:24.216 --> 06:27.254
Flow-going would be a lot
easier if your classmates
weren't such big brains.

06:27.286 --> 06:30.189
Buffy, that's ridiculous.
They are no smarter...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
-than you or me.
-MIKE: Willow?

06:32.259 --> 06:36.228
Because social phenomena
don't have unproblematic
objective existences.

06:36.262 --> 06:39.699
They have to be interpreted
and given meanings
by those who encounter them.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.100
Nicely put.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.603
So, Ruby, does that mean there
are countless realities?

06:43.637 --> 06:44.937
What?

06:44.971 --> 06:47.807
You're not dumb.
Just rusty.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.076
Maybe I should ease back in
with some non-taxing classes,

06:50.110 --> 06:53.245
like Introduction to Pies
or maybe Advanced Walking.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.314
Hey. How'd it go?

06:55.348 --> 06:58.418
She did fine.
Sociology, not a big fav.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.620
-She didn't like Mike?
-No, look, it's fine.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.990
I just need to spend
a little more time
reacclimating.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.425
You know, to get back into
the swing of things-- Oh!

07:06.459 --> 07:09.129
Hey! You could at least
say "sorry," rude-o.

07:09.161 --> 07:12.298
Everybody's in a hurry.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.338
Francis Seven,
this is Logan Five.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.240
I'm in position.
Do you copy?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.011
Yeah, Warren, we copy that.
And you're up on the monitor.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.812
Hey, Warren,
this is working great.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.184
Runner is tagged,
inhibitor is on.
Repeat: inhibitor is on.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.319
Initiate
omega pulse sequence.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.197
My art appreciation class
doesn't start for
another 20 minutes.

07:45.231 --> 07:49.302
So we've got
some time to kill.
Um, here.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.939
You'll like it.
It's very mellow.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.042
(whooshing)

07:55.074 --> 07:58.345
Didn't think she liked
my cooking until I realized
that that was her yummy face.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.379
-You know how her nose--
-What was that?

08:00.413 --> 08:03.850
-What was what?
-Uh, that, that noise.

08:03.884 --> 08:07.220
What--
What was that about cooking?
Whose yummy face?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.889
Willow.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.060
Wow, you really got engrossed
in that Renaissance book.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.531
I guess. I--
I must have spaced out.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.332
Oh, I, I do that sometimes.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.168
-Once, Willow and I were
watching Spongebob Squarepants--
-(whooshing)

08:22.201 --> 08:25.773
Buffy, are you coming?
We're gonna be late for class.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.542
What the f--

08:29.942 --> 08:32.679
Is it working?
Is it doing it?
Dude, it's doing it.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.682
And it's wicked cool.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.087
Tara! Tara, what--

08:42.121 --> 08:45.057
(whooshing)

08:47.094 --> 08:49.697
Buffy, where have you been?
You missed art class.

08:49.730 --> 08:53.500
Missed? Tara, something
freaky is going on.
It's like I'm--

08:53.533 --> 08:55.702
-(whooshing)
-Look, there! There!

08:55.735 --> 08:57.403
Did you see--

08:59.471 --> 09:01.041
Crap!

09:05.245 --> 09:06.980
Tara!

09:09.249 --> 09:11.451
Tara, wait!

09:17.658 --> 09:19.158
Ooh!

09:22.830 --> 09:24.898
Oh!
(groans)

09:24.932 --> 09:27.835
(groaning)

09:34.073 --> 09:36.275
BUFFY:
That noise,
there's something on me.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.250
Oh, no.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.086
-Uh-oh.
-She found it.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.592
-Oh, this is bad.
-Really bad.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.663
-Self-destruct.
Self-destruct!
-I, I don't know.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.931
No.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.784
Okay. Score me.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.855
Right. Fifty points
for ingenuity.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.024
Another 30
since it involved
actual contact.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.427
-Very smooth, by the way.
-On the freak-o-meter,
I'd say she was at a six.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.028
Oh, come on.
It's an eight easy.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.966
(whispering)

10:35.001 --> 10:38.538
We'll split the diff.
Call it a seven,
which is good for 140,

10:38.571 --> 10:39.706
giving you
a grand total of--

10:39.740 --> 10:42.575
-220.
-(laughs)
Beat that!

10:43.509 --> 10:44.677
Oh, I will.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.715
ANDREW:
I will.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.688
BUFFY:
This is gonna be great.
Diving into the work force.

10:55.722 --> 10:59.625
Being a breadwinner.
Building things
with my hands.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.561
Uh, actually,
you won't be building...

11:01.594 --> 11:04.230
so much as lifting
and toting.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.167
Toting?
It's just
a temp gig, Buff.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.469
You know, unless it takes.
Since you're not union,

11:09.501 --> 11:12.404
I had to call in a few favors
to get you on a crew.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.341
I appreciate it.
Muchly.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.644
You saved me from having
to accept Giles's offer
to work at the Magic Box.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.480
I mean, retail?
(shudders)

11:21.514 --> 11:23.750
I'd rather be dead.
Again.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.086
Uh-huh. So,
Giles have any thoughts...

11:27.120 --> 11:29.655
about your little
fast-forward freak-out
at school?

11:29.688 --> 11:31.759
No. Oh, well,
he implied...

11:31.792 --> 11:33.826
that maybe
it was stress-related.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.863
Like I was imagining it
or something.

11:35.895 --> 11:39.399
I don't know. Maybe.
I guess I could have
been blacking out.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.400
But there was this thing
on my sweater, you know?

11:41.433 --> 11:44.504
And then it just
blew away or went poof.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.240
Maybe it was lint.
Maybe it was evil lint.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.442
Okay, first tip
of the day.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.611
When I introduce you
to Tony, the foreman,

11:52.644 --> 11:56.649
you might want to leave out
stuff about blacking out
and evil lint.

11:58.418 --> 12:02.188
Hey, Tony. This is Buffy.
You know, that friend
I told you about.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.456
Nice to meet you,
Tony.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.394
Guys.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.898
You gotta be
kidding me.
We're a week behind.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.966
I got two men out
on a DL.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.036
-Now you want us to
babysit some little girl?
-Excuse me, but--

12:16.068 --> 12:18.370
Hang on, Gidget.
This stinks, Harris.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.740
-What am I supposed
to do with her?
-Give her a chance.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.710
-She's stronger
than she looks.
-(scoffs)

12:23.743 --> 12:25.879
That's the spirit.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.315
Don't mind him.
He may seem
pig ignorant,

12:28.347 --> 12:30.884
rude, and
a little hostile.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.985
-Have fun.
-W-W-Where are you going?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.455
Upstairs.
I need to supervise
the Sheetrock hangers.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.591
Don't sweat it.
I'll be back
and check on you later.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.461
Okay, Danny,
finish putting in
those J-boxes.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.831
Vince, Marco,
I need you to haul
the steel inside.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.999
WORKER:
Gee, I don't know, Tone.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.134
I don't want to get
in trouble with those
affirmative action lawyers.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.802
You know what I'm sayin'.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.738
Why don't you put, uh,
little Britney here
on hauling duty?

12:51.770 --> 12:53.773
It's Buffy.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.741
Okay, princess.
You're on it.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.845
Try not
to break a nail.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.013
(muttering)

13:03.350 --> 13:05.451
Don't worry about it.
And don't let them hassle you...

13:05.485 --> 13:07.354
into doing something stupid
and hurting yourself.

13:07.386 --> 13:11.291
These beams weigh
quite a few hundred pounds.
TONY: Whoa!

13:11.323 --> 13:12.960
Which way?

13:14.061 --> 13:15.995
Thanks.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.802
So, basically,
I'm just trying to learn
everything I can. You know?

13:22.836 --> 13:26.005
'Cause I don't want just a job.
I want a career.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.841
You know, something I can
really grow into-- Oh!

13:28.875 --> 13:31.043
I mean, I never
thought I'd be working
in construction,

13:31.077 --> 13:33.013
but you know
when you think about it,
it kinda makes sense--

13:33.046 --> 13:35.282
Hey, we get paid
by the hour.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.384
You wanna ruin it
for the rest of us?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.019
Slow down.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.700
Ah! Got visual
of subject, 4:00.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.869
That's not 4:00.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.337
Well, it is
if you're facing
the front of the van.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.008
But we're not facing
the front of the van.
We're facing out that way.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.009
That's 12,
so she's at 2:00.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.912
Look, she's over there,
okay?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.379
Okay.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.251
You're up.

14:18.390 --> 14:22.394
(eerie flute music)

14:28.567 --> 14:30.537
(eerie flute music continues)

14:42.081 --> 14:44.017
(gasps) Oh!

14:44.051 --> 14:45.851
Jumpy.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.421
What's the matter?
I scare you?

15:39.706 --> 15:44.277
(frightened chatter)

15:44.311 --> 15:46.013
Hey.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.440
Oh, man.
She took 'em out.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.375
Let me see.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.611
-Okay, give it back now.
-No, I'm still looking.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.481
No, you had your turn.
Now give me--
No, I'm still--

16:22.514 --> 16:27.220
(horn blaring
theme from Star Wars )

16:27.254 --> 16:28.254
Duck!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.761
Hey, all you said
was lose the mural.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.503
Oh, my God!
Buffy, what--

16:43.536 --> 16:45.437
What happened?
How--

16:45.538 --> 16:47.974
Ah, Buffy, I know these guys
can be jerks,
but was it necessary--

16:48.006 --> 16:50.876
Well, I didn't do that.
I'll tell you
what she did.

16:50.909 --> 16:54.081
I came over to tell
your friend I was impressed
with the job she was doing,

16:54.114 --> 16:56.082
liking the way
she handles herself,
and all of a sudden,

16:56.115 --> 16:58.150
she goes berserk
and attacks me.

16:58.184 --> 17:02.089
Wha-- I saved you
from the d--

17:02.121 --> 17:05.991
The demons. There were
three big apey things.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.228
No. No, not here.
Not at my job.
That's your job.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.431
I can't help
where the forces of darkness
attack me, Xander.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.500
Buffy, would you
look at this mess?

17:13.531 --> 17:16.336
Do you have any idea
how much it's gonna
cost to repair this?

17:16.367 --> 17:18.270
And what am I supposed
to say to the clients?

17:18.305 --> 17:20.507
Should I just show 'em
the demon bodies,
and say it's all their fault?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.973
You can't.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.711
They melted.

17:25.743 --> 17:29.848
But, uh, uh,
th-there were witnesses.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.851
Vince! Vince,
you could
tell them, right?

17:31.884 --> 17:35.922
How, How I jumped in
and protected you
from those... things?

17:35.954 --> 17:37.523
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.526
All I know is you were
losing it or something.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.961
(chuckles) It's that time
of the month, huh?

17:41.993 --> 17:46.232
What? You were
huddled in a corner,
crying like a baby.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.969
Hey, hey, no way.
Me, cryin'?
You're trippin', sweetie.

17:50.001 --> 17:52.739
Trippin'.
What's her problem?

17:58.278 --> 18:01.614
I didn't imagine this,
Xander.
I know. I believe you.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.217
In fact, I'm starting to think
between this attack
and the school thing,

18:04.250 --> 18:05.884
that somebody's
messing with you.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.787
Really? You think
they're connected?

18:07.819 --> 18:10.088
Well, there's something
going on. I think
it's worth checking out.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.625
And I don't mean later.
You need to see Giles
and get on it right away.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.095
I'd start with
ID'ing those demons.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.730
You're firing me,
aren't you?
Big time.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.500
The whole melty thing
ought to help narrow it down.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.336
Uh, try sketching them.
That always helps.

18:24.371 --> 18:27.940
And then maybe when
I get off work, I'll help you
go through the mug shots.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.616
BUFFY:
This is gonna be great.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.420
You know, I've always
been interested in, um,

18:40.452 --> 18:42.322
interested in retail.

18:44.824 --> 18:49.662
Uh, is this all research
or just some kind
of stress test for the table?

18:49.695 --> 18:52.865
I just want to be thorough.
This time anomaly,

18:52.898 --> 18:56.536
and, and the demon attacks
could be completely
unrelated events.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.838
But if they're not,
you might be
in some danger.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.708
So, situation normal then.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.612
Let's review.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.949
Um, you record returns here.
And these are the slips
for special orders.

19:09.981 --> 19:13.519
You ship them wherever
the customer wants.
And these are the hold slips.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.021
Fill out two hold slips
for each item.

19:16.055 --> 19:19.226
ANYA:
Oh, and be sure to remove
the items from the shelf.

19:19.259 --> 19:23.395
Um, I can illustrate
with an amusing story
about a crystal.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.698
Um, see, there was
this certain customer...

19:25.731 --> 19:28.000
who'd wanted
to purchase a sapphire.

19:28.034 --> 19:32.239
A, A sapphire.
Well, a ding-dong, right?

19:32.271 --> 19:34.574
And, so, anyway,
I thought it was
just all crazy--

19:34.606 --> 19:37.309
This is so dull,
I might actually
have fallen asleep,

19:37.344 --> 19:40.179
and be dreaming,
you guys.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.214
Why is the Slayer
here anyway?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.651
She's a student,
she's a construction
worker,

19:44.683 --> 19:48.488
and now she's
some kind of
selling-stuff person?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.690
It's like she's
completely without focus.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.595
Should we check
the other channels
for free cable porn?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.364
Guys, I'm ready.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.702
I need you to hold hands.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.605
With each other?

20:05.637 --> 20:09.776
Well, you know what
homophobia really means
about you, don't you?

20:09.808 --> 20:12.244
Stop touching
my magic bone!

20:16.115 --> 20:17.450
Shut up.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.618
Okay.

20:22.153 --> 20:25.892
Okay. It's in Latin,
so don't laugh.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.926
It's supposed
to sound like this.

20:34.232 --> 20:38.170
(speaking Latin)

20:46.578 --> 20:48.580
ALL: (coughing)

20:55.121 --> 20:57.523
(coughing continues,
distant)

21:00.626 --> 21:02.161
(bell chimes)

21:03.496 --> 21:05.531
Buffy, a word
in your ear.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.101
While I was
running the store,

21:09.134 --> 21:11.837
I, I found it useful
to imagine myself
back in the library.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006
Um, you know,
if you concentrate on service,

21:14.039 --> 21:16.742
and, and not on making a sale,

21:16.776 --> 21:20.112
you're more likely
to have a satisfied customer.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.582
Guess I'll have to
find my own style.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.851
Yes. Yeah, uh,
quite, quite right.

21:28.887 --> 21:32.023
That woman,
go sell her something.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.698
(sighs)

21:38.730 --> 21:43.234
Miss, which candle
creates a more, you know,
romantic atmosphere?

21:44.302 --> 21:47.507
Hmm.
"Lemon Seduction."

21:49.642 --> 21:53.512
Ew! "Essence of Slug."
Here you go.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.314
Thank you.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.415
Yeah.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.050
May I help you?

21:59.085 --> 22:01.854
I need something
for a prosperity spell.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.356
I heard you have it.
A mummy hand?

22:04.391 --> 22:07.460
Uh, yeah. Actually,
I saw one downstairs.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.195
It's kind of hairy, though.
Maybe it was a daddy hand.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.266
I'll just get it.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.511
"Petrified hamster."
Ew.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.913
"Eyeballs in honey."

22:27.946 --> 22:29.781
"Dagger of Lex."

22:33.285 --> 22:35.587
Ooh. Ancient mummy hand.
Oh!

22:35.622 --> 22:37.923
(gasping)

22:53.605 --> 22:56.075
And you get
the Dagger of Lex
for free with it.

22:56.107 --> 22:58.009
See the inlaid
mother-of-pearl,

22:58.044 --> 23:00.547
underneath
the black, oozing goo?

23:00.579 --> 23:02.615
This hand is dead.
The power is gone.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.451
I-I'm not giving you
money for this.

23:04.483 --> 23:07.053
Oh, it's just playing dead.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.587
Little scamp.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.156
(bell chimes)

23:12.625 --> 23:15.294
Buffy, a word
in your ear.

23:15.326 --> 23:17.063
Um, while I was
running the store--
Huh?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.698
-What? Huh?
-I found it useful to, uh,

23:18.730 --> 23:20.932
to imagine myself
back in the library.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.536
-You know, if you--
-We did this just now.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.637
Giles, something
is happening.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.405
Yes, oh, uh, quite right.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.107
Ah, you did it.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.111
Dude, she's looping.
What, what'd you do,
enchant the hand thing?

23:32.144 --> 23:34.313
Uh, well, not exactly.

23:34.346 --> 23:38.785
I made it so she had to
satisfy a customer with
a task that resists solving.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.318
Maybe I should have done more.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.488
Like what?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.556
I don't know.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.356
Like make her kind of itchy?

23:47.425 --> 23:49.260
Go help the lady
who just came in.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.564
Wait--
Don't worry.
Don't be nervous.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.432
Do what I do.
Just picture yourself naked.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.302
(sighs)

23:57.336 --> 23:58.971
Uh, miss, I--

24:01.440 --> 24:04.911
Hi. I'm looking
for something
really specific.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.480
-I heard you carry it.
-A mummy hand.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.317
You look like
the mummy hand type.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.352
Sorry. I can't
get that for you.

24:13.384 --> 24:15.153
I called here 20 minutes ago,

24:15.186 --> 24:16.855
and someone said you had one.

24:16.888 --> 24:20.960
Yeah, um, but,
there's a thing happening.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.796
You have one,
and, and I was told
I could buy it.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.933
And I'm sorry,
but I'm really gonna
have to hold you to that.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.202
I'm not leaving until
I get a mummy hand.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.673
Okay.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.210
I guess...

24:38.243 --> 24:40.512
I'll have to
get it for you.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.281
She's smart. So she's
figuring out the game.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.384
Satisfy the customer.

24:45.416 --> 24:47.318
Well, she just might
have beat you there, Stretch.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.489
No way.
She hasn't even started yet.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.458
I just hope she solves it
faster than Data did...

24:52.490 --> 24:54.626
on the ep of T-N-G
where the Enterprise
kept blowing up.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.730
Or, Or Mulder in that X-Files,
where the bank kept exploding.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.665
Scully wants me
so bad.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.159
Fingers sold separately.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.760
(door opens,
bell chimes)

25:32.731 --> 25:35.000
-(sighs)
-Where you going?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.536
-Lady needs a mummy hand.
-What?

25:37.569 --> 25:39.038
You haven't even
talked to her yet.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.209
I could explain,
but you would just
forget it.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.376
I'm worried
about you.

25:45.411 --> 25:49.848
Um, retail is a, is a fast-paced
and exciting world.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.984
I mean, has this whole day
just gone by
too quickly for you?

25:53.819 --> 25:55.287
No.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.423
No, I don't think
that's exactly the problem.

25:58.457 --> 26:02.028
Buffy, a word in your ear.
Um, if you think
of the store as a, as a library,

26:02.060 --> 26:04.462
it'll help you
to concentrate on, on, uh,

26:04.496 --> 26:07.465
service rather than selling.

26:07.499 --> 26:11.369
Yes. And then I'm going
to marry Bob Dole
and raise penguins in Guam.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.306
Yes, uh, quite right.
Yes.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.443
(sighs)

26:18.477 --> 26:19.478
Uh, miss, I--

26:19.510 --> 26:21.480
Mummy hand, right?

26:21.512 --> 26:23.082
You got it, lady.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.184
(straining)

26:28.153 --> 26:29.955
(door opens,
bell chimes)

26:32.659 --> 26:35.126
-(door opens, bell chimes,
door closes)
-Miss--

26:38.596 --> 26:40.332
(bell chimes)

26:44.002 --> 26:45.304
Miss?

26:45.336 --> 26:46.939
Hi.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.440
(tongs tapping)

26:52.644 --> 26:54.346
(door opens,
bell chimes)

27:01.887 --> 27:05.490
You like slug, go with slug.
She's not gonna
sleep with you anyway.

27:05.523 --> 27:07.292
This mummy hand
has ceased to be!

27:07.326 --> 27:09.295
ANDREW:
It is an ex-mummy hand!

27:10.663 --> 27:11.963
Buffy, a word
in your ear.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.671
(door opens,
bell chimes)

27:19.337 --> 27:20.873
BUFFY: It's you!

27:21.539 --> 27:22.709
You're doing this!

27:23.409 --> 27:25.010
-(groans)
-Oh!

27:25.877 --> 27:27.846
(sobbing)

27:30.817 --> 27:33.352
I know we promised you
a mummy hand.
It's just...

27:34.686 --> 27:36.454
I can't get it for you.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.490
Um, there's something
wrong with it.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.728
-It's defective.
-Defective?

27:41.760 --> 27:45.497
Are you sure? I--
There must be something
you can do.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.232
But there's no way
to get--

27:51.103 --> 27:53.138
to get that hand,

27:53.172 --> 27:54.673
but I can
special-order one.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.375
We can deliver it
anywhere you want.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.878
-Really?
-(cash register dings)

27:59.912 --> 28:01.948
Thank you for shopping
at the Magic Box.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.916
JONATHAN
Oh, ho! Yes!

28:05.852 --> 28:07.519
Eek!

28:07.553 --> 28:10.221
ANDREW: So, Warren had 220.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.858
And I had that bonus
for getting her fired.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.193
But the biggest component
has to be
how long it took to finish.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.328
Mine took the longest.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.832
Only from a perspective
external to the time loops.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.234
From Mr. Giles's perspective,
it was shortest of all.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.339
-So what do we do?
-Oh, it's obvious.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.541
I mean, it's not over.

28:32.912 --> 28:36.115
Buffy, your first sale.
Congratulations.

28:38.584 --> 28:43.923
You-- You didn't charge
for delivery.
Ooh.

28:43.955 --> 28:46.792
Well, your first day.
You know, these things happen.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.628
Yeah, I'll just
take it out of your pay.

28:52.463 --> 28:55.166
Ye-Yes. I-I'm sure Buffy
would understand that.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.105
Absolutely.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.114
(door slams shut)

29:13.152 --> 29:14.953
BUFFY:
This is gonna be great.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.025
(groans)

29:22.127 --> 29:23.662
Life is stupid.

29:24.695 --> 29:27.499
I have a dim memory
of that, yeah.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.500
And I didn't figure
you were here
cadging my whiskey,

29:29.535 --> 29:31.136
'cause life is all
full of blood and peaches.

29:32.503 --> 29:34.740
There's this thing.

29:34.772 --> 29:38.344
Someone's doing
stuff to me,
messing up my life.

29:38.376 --> 29:41.079
Except that it was kind of
pre-messed already.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.183
You know,
with school and jobs.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.718
It's pretty bad even
without the evil.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.655
So, you, uh,
just what?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.825
You gonna let
this whoever play you...

29:52.858 --> 29:54.492
till it figures out
what kills you?

29:55.394 --> 29:57.729
Giles is
working on it.
Oh, good.

29:57.829 --> 30:00.165
'Cause Giles wields
the mighty force
of library books.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.667
You'd do better?

30:02.701 --> 30:07.138
Damn right.
I'd hit the demon world.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.608
Ask questions, throw punches,
find out what's in the air.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.344
Hmm? It's fun too.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.713
It's not my kind of fun.

30:16.682 --> 30:20.451
Yeah, it is.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.855
And your life's gonna
get a lot less confusing
when you figure that out.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.025
You have had so too much
to drink at this point,

30:26.057 --> 30:27.492
I am cuttin' you off.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.830
(groaning, shuddering)

30:35.101 --> 30:36.234
You're not a schoolgirl.

30:38.436 --> 30:41.573
You're not a shopgirl.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.843
You're a creature
of the darkness,
like me.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.880
Try on my world.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.215
See how good it feels.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.617
Are there drinks
in your world?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.189
(rock music playing)

31:02.260 --> 31:04.663
Your motorcycle is loud.
DAVE:
S-S-S-S-Spike.

31:04.695 --> 31:06.531
The usual, Dave,
and one for the lady.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.268
We're heading
for the back room, pet.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.338
Where the real
action is.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.574
(groans)

31:15.606 --> 31:17.977
(chatter)

31:22.548 --> 31:25.284
These lowlifes know
everything that happens
in this town.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.586
Oh, good.
These are the lowlifes.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.490
Fine.
A little louder.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.894
Boys, what's the game?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.496
SMALL DEMON:
You know the game, Spike.

31:38.763 --> 31:39.798
You in?

31:39.830 --> 31:42.468
He kills our kind.
Don't let him in.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.405
-Oh! Ask him if he's heard--
-Later.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.247
You're gonna play cards?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.553
I need a moment
with my lady.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.621
Go ahead.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.893
(grunts)
Look, you wanna play,
that's fine.

32:07.925 --> 32:10.828
Hey, I am sticking
to the original plan.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.265
Which one do I kill
for information?
Listen.

32:13.298 --> 32:16.301
These guys talk
while they play.

32:16.335 --> 32:20.105
We'll get more information
out of their mouths than out of
gaping holes in their corpses.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.346
I'm in.
Everyone okay with that?

32:30.382 --> 32:31.650
Ante up.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.021
(meowing)

32:38.356 --> 32:40.159
You play for kittens?

32:40.192 --> 32:43.328
So, who's gonna advance me
a tiny tabby, get me started?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.032
Come on.
Someone's got to stake me.

32:47.066 --> 32:47.965
I'll do it.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.935
What?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.804
You thought I was just
gonna let that lie there?

32:55.673 --> 32:56.807
BUFFY: (groans)

33:00.011 --> 33:01.880
-Where are we going?
-To Final Jeopardy.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.982
Where Buffy's
the one in jeopardy.

33:05.017 --> 33:09.288
We're really super-villains
now, like. like Dr. No.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.324
Yes, back when
Bond was Connery
and movies were decent.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.959
Who even remembers Connery?

33:13.991 --> 33:15.826
I mean,
Roger Moore was smooth.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.329
You're insane.
You're short,
and you're insane.

33:19.830 --> 33:22.201
I like Timothy Dalton.

33:22.233 --> 33:25.371
Hey!
Don't make me
pull over, okay?

33:26.738 --> 33:27.739
(meowing)

33:27.772 --> 33:29.540
DEMONS: (groaning)

33:31.676 --> 33:33.244
You're lucky today,
Spike.

33:33.278 --> 33:36.082
-I've got my
good luck charm with me.
-(groans)

33:36.115 --> 33:38.217
You cleaned us out.
No one's that lucky.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.220
Yeah. I'm startin'
to think you cheat.

33:41.252 --> 33:42.721
-Me?
-ALL: Yeah!

33:42.753 --> 33:43.689
I cheat?

33:43.721 --> 33:45.523
He's got X-ray vision.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.926
-(chuckles) I'm not using it.
-We are not the ones
who are cheating.

33:53.898 --> 33:57.536
I, I had no idea that was there.
I could've leaned on that
days ago.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.037
SMALL DEMON:
You better go, Spike.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.506
Things could get ugly.

34:00.538 --> 34:04.942
Got ugly the second
he walked in.
Him and his human.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.480
Her skin's so tight,
I don't even know how
you can look at her. Ew!

34:10.949 --> 34:13.985
-Leave your winnings
and get out.
-Yeah.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.188
We'll forget
this whole thing.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.958
Ah. So it's a setup,
isn't it?

34:19.989 --> 34:22.460
Squeeze a few quid
out of the vamp.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.929
Well, I'll tell you
what you didn't count on,
me and the bird.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.297
-BUFFY: (groans)
-You want a fight?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.666
You face the two of us.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.771
What? I'm not getting
into a bar fight.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.440
I'll beat 'em up
for information, great,

34:35.474 --> 34:38.809
but not to defend
your rights to gamble
for kittens.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.945
Which, by the way,
is stupid currency.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.614
-They're delicious!
-SPIKE: Come on, Slayer.

34:43.648 --> 34:46.784
-A big fight's
just what you need.
-Forget it.

34:46.818 --> 34:50.155
I'm not playing by
anyone else's rules anymore.
I'm done.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.259
-Hey, I won these!
-BUFFY: Scamper.
Be free, kittens.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.860
-The money's gettin' away.
-Give me that!

34:59.364 --> 35:02.000
-What's wrong, love?
-What's wrong?

35:02.032 --> 35:03.835
You were gonna help me.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.438
You, You were gonna beat heads
and, and, and fix my life.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.340
But you're completely lame.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.978
Tonight sucks!
And look at me.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.181
Look at--
Look at stupid Buffy.

35:15.213 --> 35:19.818
Too dumb for college
and, and, and freak Buffy.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.753
Too strong
for construction work.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.255
And, and my job
at the Magic Shop?

35:24.289 --> 35:27.259
I was bored to tears
even before the hour
that wouldn't end.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.829
And the only person
that I can even stand
to be around...

35:30.862 --> 35:34.166
is a neutered vampire
who cheats at kitten poker.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.802
Oh. You saw
the cheating, did you?

35:36.835 --> 35:39.538
Also,
I think you're drunk.

35:43.974 --> 35:45.976
(sighs)

35:46.010 --> 35:48.880
Connery is Bond.
He had style.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.949
Yeah, but Roger Moore
was funny.

35:50.981 --> 35:53.552
Moonraker?
The gondola turns
into a hovercraft?

35:53.585 --> 35:57.054
It's retarded.
And, besides,
the guy had, like, no edge.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.858
Dalton had edge.
In License to Kill,
he was a rogue agent.

36:00.891 --> 36:02.860
That's edgy.

36:02.893 --> 36:04.862
And he was amazing
in The Living Daylights.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.065
Yeah, which was written
for Roger Moore,
not Timothy Dalton.

36:07.097 --> 36:09.668
This is stupid!
We're wasting time.
End of discussion.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.041
I mean, there's a shot of,
like, pigeons doing double takes
when the gondola blasted by.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.244
Moonraker is inexcusable.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.420
That van.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.190
You want to steal a van,
I'm with you, love,

36:32.224 --> 36:34.592
but we have got
the motorcycle.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.827
I've seen it before.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.829
At the construction site.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.733
Connery is the only actor
of the bunch.

36:41.766 --> 36:43.702
Timothy Dalton
should get an Oscar,

36:43.735 --> 36:46.605
and beat Sean Connery
over the head with it!

36:46.637 --> 36:49.074
-Okay, that's it.
-Hey! Stop it!

36:49.106 --> 36:51.076
Guys! No!

36:51.108 --> 36:53.445
(gasps)
Look!

36:53.478 --> 36:55.514
ANDREW:
Oh, she's coming over here.
What do we do?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.416
Jonathan,
grab your magic bone.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.523
(growling)

37:05.556 --> 37:07.925
You have discovered me!

37:08.960 --> 37:10.929
But do not try
to defeat me,

37:10.961 --> 37:14.599
-for I have been testing you,
and I know your weaknesses.
-(van engine starts)

37:14.632 --> 37:17.568
(evil laugh)
Huh?

37:29.146 --> 37:30.148
No!

37:30.181 --> 37:32.784
I'm okay! I'm fine!
Get off me!

37:32.818 --> 37:35.387
I am well struck!

37:35.420 --> 37:39.257
I call on the misty portal
to my demon dimension,

37:39.291 --> 37:42.293
where I'll lay my head
and gently die.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.699
(coughing)

37:49.934 --> 37:52.403
He blew up.
Did you just see that?

37:52.438 --> 37:55.507
Yeah, I saw.
He's gone.

37:55.541 --> 37:59.677
Gotta love it, you know?
Makes you feel all powerful.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.380
Strong.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.782
Kinda sick.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.150
(panting)

38:09.521 --> 38:12.490
-She hurt me all over.
-Someone'll see you.
Get in the back.

38:12.523 --> 38:16.695
-I won't fit.
-Well, do the thing.

38:16.728 --> 38:20.398
Oh, right.
Let the spell be ended.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.871
Ow.
(moans)

38:28.407 --> 38:30.675
(groaning)

38:30.708 --> 38:32.710
Ow!

38:35.213 --> 38:37.148
Ow!

38:37.181 --> 38:38.817
Oh! Next time
I do that spell,

38:38.849 --> 38:41.219
one of you guys
has to look like the demon.

38:41.251 --> 38:43.221
The Slayer touched you.

38:43.253 --> 38:46.391
Yeah, it was sexy,
the way she touched me
real hard with her fists.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.860
I only looked big.

38:48.893 --> 38:53.231
I actually had
the proportional strength
of, uh, me.

38:53.264 --> 38:57.536
Guys, think about this.
We took on the Slayer.

38:57.568 --> 39:00.038
I mean, we've got
all kinds of stuff
in the computer now,

39:00.070 --> 39:02.072
speed, strength,
reaction time.

39:02.106 --> 39:05.043
We're getting what we need
to really become
a threat to her.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.313
We tested her, faced her,
and we survived.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.248
Unless I have internal injuries
that will eventually kill me.

39:11.282 --> 39:14.251
Oh, of course.
But barring that,
Warren's right.

39:14.284 --> 39:18.056
-We did good.
-The Trio versus the Slayer.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.192
It's not over.

39:21.226 --> 39:24.663
Plus look what Warren and me
discovered by accident
before we drove away.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.697
What?

39:26.731 --> 39:29.867
ALL:
Free cable porn.

39:38.108 --> 39:40.378
Feel any better?

39:40.411 --> 39:45.083
I think at one point
I actually turned
completely inside out.

39:45.115 --> 39:48.119
But, yeah. Better.

39:48.152 --> 39:53.090
I'm sorry I didn't, uh,
find this demon
with my research. I'm not--

39:53.123 --> 39:55.393
Oh, it's okay.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.429
It, it wasn't
much of a fight.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.431
I got lucky.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.873
I'm really screwing up,
Giles.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.675
What? Come on.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.813
You were being tested,

40:14.846 --> 40:18.048
sequentially by some
unknown demon.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.818
I don't call that
screwing up.

40:20.851 --> 40:22.588
No, it completely is.

40:23.954 --> 40:25.891
I let the demon
set the rules.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.494
Go easy on yourself,
will you?

40:28.527 --> 40:31.630
I mean, you don't have
to figure the whole thing out
at once, you know,

40:31.663 --> 40:33.532
the job and everything.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.501
You're pushing yourself
too hard.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.971
The nice people
at the phone company...

40:40.005 --> 40:41.706
seem to think
it's not hard enough.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.777
Well, maybe there's something
I can do about that.

40:48.378 --> 40:50.882
This is, um, I--

40:56.286 --> 40:58.188
It's for you.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.791
A check?

41:07.532 --> 41:11.202
-This is, is too much.
I, I can't take it.
-Well, tear it up if--

41:11.235 --> 41:15.740
No! I was just being polite.
I'm taking the money.

41:17.876 --> 41:21.246
This is, this is great.
This is more than great.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.652
I don't really know
how to say this...

41:30.822 --> 41:33.559
but it's a little
like having Mom back.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.193
In this scenario,
I am your mother.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.565
Want to be my shiftless
absentee father?

41:43.400 --> 41:46.938
Is there some sort of, um,
rakish uncle?

41:49.940 --> 41:51.543
I'm just saying...

41:52.610 --> 41:55.847
thank you so much.

41:59.717 --> 42:00.885
Uh...

42:02.387 --> 42:05.222
I'm gonna
show this to Dawn.

42:05.255 --> 42:07.726
She loves it
when things get easy.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.369
I just wanna tell you,

42:19.403 --> 42:22.273
that, um, this--

42:24.943 --> 42:27.846
It makes me feel safe.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.481
Knowing you're
always gonna be here.

42:50.601 --> 42:52.670
(theme music playing)

43:15.626 --> 43:18.028
Grr! Arrgh!
