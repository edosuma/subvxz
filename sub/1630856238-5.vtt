00:02.125 --> 00:03.750
NARRATOR: Tonight on The Curse
of Oak Island...

00:03.958 --> 00:05.208
MAX: We're excited
to present the results

00:05.375 --> 00:07.167
from the muon tomography.
So, what we're seeing is

00:07.333 --> 00:09.583
high-density anomaly below
the surface of the Money Pit.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.292
We think it's Aladdin's Cave.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.625
It could lead to the treasure.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.417
-I think I've hit a void.
-The plot thickens.

00:18.625 --> 00:21.042
Oh! It's here. Look at that.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.500
RICK:
This is really something.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.833
-There are letters stamped on.
-MARTY: Whoa!

00:25.958 --> 00:28.125
-It could be very old.
-Yeah.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.333
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.500 --> 00:36.458
where people
have been looking for

00:36.542 --> 00:40.375
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:40.542 --> 00:43.958
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.083 --> 00:46.167
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:47.125 --> 00:50.667
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:50.833 --> 00:54.708
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:54.875 --> 00:56.583
to the Knights Templar.

00:56.792 --> 00:59.000
To date, six men have died

00:59.208 --> 01:01.667
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.833 --> 01:07.125
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.333 --> 01:09.542
before the treasure
can be found.

01:09.708 --> 01:12.125
♪ ♪

01:22.250 --> 01:24.125
-RICK: Morning, Paul.
-COTE: Morning, Rick.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.292
I see you're set up,
ready to rock and roll.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.833
Yeah. Roger got us all,
uh, moved in.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
-Okay.
-And he started

01:31.208 --> 01:32.292
-pumping some water.
-Right.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.667
How many hours a day
are you pumping?

01:34.875 --> 01:36.958
-Six hours, maybe. Yeah.
-Oh, really?

01:37.125 --> 01:39.250
NARRATOR:
A new day of abounding hope

01:39.375 --> 01:43.208
has begun on Oak Island for
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

01:43.375 --> 01:46.917
and their team
as the operation to deepen

01:47.042 --> 01:49.000
the mid-18th-century
Garden Shaft

01:49.167 --> 01:51.500
has finally gotten underway.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.708
Is the system gonna be
the same, then,

01:53.875 --> 01:55.583
for, like,
extracting the material?

01:55.750 --> 01:58.375
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
No, it's pretty much the same.

01:58.542 --> 02:00.083
So, we're, uh,
we've got a little bit

02:00.250 --> 02:02.083
-of hammer-grabbing to do.
-Okay.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.083
Taking out the old spoils
and the slime

02:04.250 --> 02:05.833
-from the bottom.
-Okay.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.625
And then we'll start
adding sets, wood sets.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.083
Right.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.833
NARRATOR:
Once representatives

02:11.000 --> 02:12.958
from Dumas Contracting Limited

02:13.125 --> 02:15.125
finish draining water
that has flooded

02:15.250 --> 02:17.125
the 82-foot-deep shaft,

02:17.208 --> 02:19.750
they will use
a three-ton digging tool,

02:19.875 --> 02:21.375
known as a hammer grab,

02:21.583 --> 02:23.500
to excavate the earth below it

02:23.667 --> 02:26.583
and construct new
eight-foot wooden levels,

02:26.750 --> 02:30.667
or sets, in the hope of
breaching a mysterious tunnel,

02:30.750 --> 02:34.417
a tunnel that has not only
yielded water samples

02:34.583 --> 02:36.667
containing evidence of gold,

02:36.833 --> 02:40.458
but which heads west
into the so-called Baby Blob,

02:40.542 --> 02:43.458
where the team has detected
the highest traces

02:43.625 --> 02:46.167
of precious metals
in the Money Pit area.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.292
There's a lot of hope

02:49.458 --> 02:51.375
regarding this
shaft extension work.

02:51.542 --> 02:56.333
We can use the Garden Shaft
to drill horizontally

02:56.542 --> 02:59.750
at various elevations,
as much as 40 feet out.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.167
So, you're talking about

03:01.375 --> 03:04.458
an 80-foot
investigative program.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.625
RICK:
I think that we're gonna know

03:06.792 --> 03:10.083
with some certainty
what's out there,

03:10.208 --> 03:11.792
and that's
important information.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.167
NARRATOR:
If high-valued targets

03:14.375 --> 03:17.333
are encountered during
the lateral drilling process

03:17.542 --> 03:20.833
and are not reachable
within the mysterious tunnel,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.417
Dumas can construct a new tunnel

03:23.583 --> 03:25.708
in order to allow the team
to retrieve them

03:25.917 --> 03:30.292
and hopefully solve
the 228-year-old mystery.

03:30.375 --> 03:34.500
Well, like last year,
I know it's a futile offer, but

03:34.667 --> 03:37.083
if you need an extra body,
I'd be happy to go down.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.417
-Sure. Sure.
-(both laugh)

03:38.542 --> 03:40.292
-Saves me the work.
-And there you go.

03:40.458 --> 03:41.208
-(laughs)
-It's a deal.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.917
-Okay.
-All right.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.167
And if we're not around
the next day,

03:44.333 --> 03:45.083
that means we got
the treasure. (laughing)

03:45.250 --> 03:46.833
We'll chase you.

03:48.042 --> 03:51.125
NARRATOR:
As the team from
Dumas Contracting Limited

03:51.292 --> 03:53.667
continues their work
in the Garden Shaft,

03:53.833 --> 03:56.333
later that morning...

03:58.667 --> 04:00.542
RICK: Welcome, everybody,
to the war room.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.000
The importance of this meeting
can't be overstated.

04:03.208 --> 04:04.292
NARRATOR:
Rick, along with

04:04.417 --> 04:06.125
his brother Marty,

04:06.292 --> 04:07.875
their partner Craig Tester,

04:08.083 --> 04:10.125
hydrogeologist Dr. Fred Michel,

04:10.292 --> 04:11.417
and other members of the team

04:11.542 --> 04:13.333
meet with representatives

04:13.542 --> 04:15.667
from Ideon Technologies

04:15.875 --> 04:16.958
for a highly anticipated

04:17.125 --> 04:19.000
scientific report.

04:19.167 --> 04:22.292
So, uh, gentlemen, I'm gonna
turn it over to you because, uh,

04:22.458 --> 04:25.125
you certainly have
a lot more insight into

04:25.250 --> 04:27.125
the possibilities of what

04:27.292 --> 04:29.375
muon technology
will help us with

04:29.583 --> 04:32.250
-as we move forward this year.
-Yeah.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
We appreciate your time today,
uh, from this big group.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.000
Um, and we're excited
to present the results,

04:37.167 --> 04:38.458
uh, from the Money Pit.

04:38.625 --> 04:39.958
-Absolutely.
-MAX: Great.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.333
So, as you all know,
we've deployed

04:41.500 --> 04:43.667
14 sensors in five boreholes

04:43.833 --> 04:46.208
in the Money Pit
at depths ranging from

04:46.375 --> 04:49.667
80 to, uh, 250 feet
below the surface.

04:49.792 --> 04:50.917
Yeah.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.625
NARRATOR:
In 2021,

04:53.750 --> 04:56.292
a team from Ideon was contracted

04:56.375 --> 04:58.292
to place several
subsurface devices

04:58.458 --> 05:01.292
deep within five
previously drilled boreholes

05:01.458 --> 05:03.417
across the Money Pit area.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.750
These devices detected
subatomic particles

05:06.917 --> 05:09.208
which constantly
pass through the Earth,

05:09.375 --> 05:11.792
known as muons,

05:11.958 --> 05:14.458
in order to search for evidence
of potential voids,

05:14.625 --> 05:16.583
tunnels, and large objects.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.750
It was an intricate process

05:18.875 --> 05:22.667
that needed nearly
two full years to complete.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.417
The primary targets
we were looking for

05:25.583 --> 05:27.542
were tunnels that crosscut
the Money Pit,

05:27.708 --> 05:29.583
vaults or voids,

05:29.750 --> 05:32.250
and of course, um,
any high-density anomalies

05:32.375 --> 05:33.625
that could reflect treasure.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.042
Those are the ones
I'm interested in.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.833
(laughter)

05:37.042 --> 05:38.167
MAX:
I figured.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.750
So, let's move underground.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.792
-Do you want to?
-Sure.

05:41.917 --> 05:44.208
DOUG S.:
So, if we take all
of the detector data

05:44.375 --> 05:46.000
from these months
of imaging time,

05:46.208 --> 05:49.667
and we combine them all and run
our tomography reconstruction,

05:49.875 --> 05:51.833
you can already see
some interesting structures

05:52.042 --> 05:53.667
in the data.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.542
MAX:
So, what you're
looking at right now

05:55.708 --> 05:58.833
are slices through the 3-D
density model of the Money Pit.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.667
Uh, the yellow background

06:00.750 --> 06:03.333
represents kind of
the neutral baseline density

06:03.500 --> 06:04.750
of the Money Pit.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.333
Low-density anomalies
are in blue

06:07.500 --> 06:10.750
and higher-density anomalies
are in orange to red.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.083
CRAIG:
Our preference is always
the high-density

06:13.250 --> 06:14.750
'cause that may mean treasure,

06:14.958 --> 06:17.333
but a low-density
could be a tunnel

06:17.500 --> 06:19.917
or the water portion of a vault.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.667
Do you see anything
over by the, uh, Garden Shaft?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.458
And it would be looking more
at around the 100-foot level.

06:26.667 --> 06:27.708
Do you see anything over there?

06:27.875 --> 06:30.000
So, this is...

06:30.208 --> 06:31.833
where my mouse is,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.042
this is approximately the area
of the Garden Shaft.

06:35.208 --> 06:38.167
That blue and gray column
is the Garden Shaft.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.500
There is a high-density anomaly

06:41.667 --> 06:43.875
to the west of the Garden Shaft.

06:44.042 --> 06:45.875
At what depth?

06:46.042 --> 06:47.167
MAX:
65 feet

06:47.375 --> 06:50.500
below the surface
of the Money Pit.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.833
And that's a high-density?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.167
MARTY:
And then a low-density anomaly
directly underneath.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.542
MAX:
Correct.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.375
And what depth would
that be, the deeper one?

06:58.500 --> 07:01.333
112-ish below the surface
of the Money Pit.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.500
Well, Dr. Fred there,
those anomalies

07:03.667 --> 07:05.583
over at the Garden Shaft
is what we're looking for.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.000
FRED:
I would agree with-with Marty.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.667
I mean, there's definitely
a high-density area

07:10.833 --> 07:13.500
to the west of the Garden Shaft

07:13.708 --> 07:15.000
in the area of the Blob.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.333
You know, which is where
we have the highest

07:17.542 --> 07:20.000
concentrations of gold
and silver in the water.

07:20.167 --> 07:23.000
So, I'm-I'm encouraged by that

07:23.208 --> 07:25.000
because it backs up what
we've been seeing in the water.

07:25.208 --> 07:29.000
But we can't drill these
with Dumas in the Garden Shaft.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.917
Correct.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.833
RICK:
Well, the target
near the Garden Shaft,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.250
I think presents the option
certainly of tunneling to it.

07:35.375 --> 07:39.833
But Dumas is working in close
proximity to the Garden Shaft.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.458
We have to give them area
to do their work.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.250
So, have you
detected anything else?

07:47.375 --> 07:48.833
MAX:
So, we'll take a look at a key

07:49.042 --> 07:50.500
high-density anomaly
that we picked out.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.875
So, what we're seeing is
a high-density anomaly

07:54.042 --> 07:55.833
sitting approximately

07:55.917 --> 07:58.875
85 feet southwest
of the Garden Shaft,

07:59.042 --> 08:02.250
about 230 feet below
the surface of The Money Pit.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.833
It's significant.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.042
DOUG S.:
So, this is looking
at that anomaly

08:07.208 --> 08:08.917
in a little more detail.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.542
MARTY:
Wow. Is it consistent with, say,

08:11.667 --> 08:15.250
a six-by-six-by-six
metal-lined box?

08:15.417 --> 08:17.542
It could be a treasure
of some sort.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.542
It's almost got to be something.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.958
But at that depth?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.583
Below the depth

08:22.750 --> 08:24.667
that known searchers
have explored.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.250
Yeah.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.917
NARRATOR:
A high-density target?

08:28.083 --> 08:31.750
Some 230 feet deep
in the Money Pit area?

08:31.917 --> 08:35.333
Could that mean there are
potentially multiple treasures

08:35.542 --> 08:37.833
buried on Oak Island?

08:37.958 --> 08:40.833
RICK:
When they explain about
the high-density target

08:41.000 --> 08:43.833
at 230 feet deep in the bedrock,

08:43.958 --> 08:47.583
it makes one pause and think,
"Could it have been done?"

08:47.708 --> 08:49.708
-We got to drill it.
-I agree with that.

08:49.875 --> 08:53.083
RICK:
The proof will come
from some sort of very

08:53.292 --> 08:54.833
disciplined drill program.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.167
But I think
we have to investigate it.

08:58.292 --> 08:59.833
Another
interesting thing is this

09:00.042 --> 09:02.458
kind of unaccounted for
low-density anomaly.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.250
In fact, you've already
found something there.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.458
This low-density anomaly
perfectly overlaps

09:09.583 --> 09:12.292
the void that you guys
call Aladdin's Cave.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.375
STEVE:
Right now, we're looking
into the cavity.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.750
So, wait. Now, stop.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.958
MARTY:
That's pretty square.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.500
Some sort of, like,
pedestal sticking out.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.917
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

09:24.042 --> 09:27.042
after drilling a borehole
known as L-15,

09:27.208 --> 09:29.792
the team discovered
a large cavern

09:29.917 --> 09:32.583
to the southwest
of the Garden Shaft,

09:32.708 --> 09:35.667
which Marty Lagina dubbed
"Aladdin's Cave."

09:36.542 --> 09:37.583
Incredibly,

09:37.750 --> 09:39.958
the team recorded video images

09:40.125 --> 09:42.958
of potential man-made
features within it,

09:43.125 --> 09:44.917
and during a subsequent
sonar scan...

09:45.083 --> 09:47.167
-SCOTT: Whoa!
-STEVE: Oh, that's
a good opening.

09:47.333 --> 09:50.208
NARRATOR:
...determined that it was
nearly 30 feet long

09:50.375 --> 09:52.125
and 12 feet wide.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.750
-It's not some simple
kind of cave.
-Right.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.667
It's kind of a tendril
going out.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.167
It kind of extends out.

09:58.375 --> 09:59.500
RICK: That tendril going out,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.375
how long is just that?

10:01.583 --> 10:04.000
It's in the 20 feet range,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.667
20, 30 feet.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.667
So, Dr. Michel,
what was the results of

10:07.833 --> 10:11.750
the water associated with L-16,
Aladdin's Cave?

10:11.917 --> 10:16.167
We have been getting,
fairly consistently,

10:16.375 --> 10:19.542
some elevated metal
concentrations with that one.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.375
So, we are seeing gold in

10:23.542 --> 10:26.208
the cavity, or Aladdin's Cave.

10:27.875 --> 10:30.208
-RICK: That's stunning.
-CRAIG: Absolutely. Yeah.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.375
Wow.

10:35.542 --> 10:38.167
It seems a bit too much
to be a coincidence.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.667
NARRATOR: In the war room,

10:39.875 --> 10:41.667
Rick, Marty, Craig,
and other members

10:41.833 --> 10:44.292
of the team have
just been informed

10:44.500 --> 10:47.792
that muon tomography scans
deep below the Money Pit area

10:47.917 --> 10:50.417
have detected potentially

10:50.583 --> 10:54.500
important clues in a large void
known as "Aladdin's Cave,"

10:54.708 --> 10:57.167
a previously discovered
cavern some

10:57.292 --> 11:00.958
160 feet underground
where, one year ago,

11:01.125 --> 11:05.083
water tests revealed
high trace evidence of gold.

11:05.250 --> 11:08.250
And if you wanted to kind
of figure out what was there,

11:08.417 --> 11:11.167
you would drill right in
the middle of the structure.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.583
Yeah.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.625
So, we have
a bunch of targets now.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.458
MARTY: Yeah.
This is exciting.

11:17.625 --> 11:19.250
This is what
we were looking for.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.708
And the fact that you can image

11:20.875 --> 11:22.375
what we call "Aladdin's Cave,"

11:22.542 --> 11:23.875
that's very gratifying.

11:24.042 --> 11:26.333
So, I say, "Let's go drill it."

11:26.500 --> 11:28.667
-Yeah.
-MARTY: One of the things we

11:28.833 --> 11:30.792
were concerned about last year
about Aladdin's Cave

11:30.958 --> 11:32.833
is it didn't appear

11:33.000 --> 11:36.625
to have an obvious inlet
or outlet to it,

11:36.750 --> 11:40.000
but the Ideon data
suggests that it does.

11:40.208 --> 11:43.000
We should drill
through the muon target.

11:43.208 --> 11:47.417
It's at the right depth
to be some sort of vault.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.292
It's at the right depth
to have been

11:49.458 --> 11:51.000
protected by a flood tunnel.

11:51.167 --> 11:55.208
It's, uh, it's clearly
an offset chamber.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.625
Uh... It could be it.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.667
ALEX:
Another piece
of good news is that

11:59.875 --> 12:01.750
it's not anywhere near
the Garden Shaft,

12:01.917 --> 12:04.083
-which means we can drill it.
-Yes.

12:04.208 --> 12:07.750
Which is good for us because
I like the cave, right?

12:07.917 --> 12:08.792
Yes.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.208
MARTY:
Yeah. I think

12:10.375 --> 12:11.208
we should head for it, Rick.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.542
This is, by far and away,

12:14.708 --> 12:16.333
the most compelling data
we've ever had.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.583
Every anomaly that Max and Doug
have presented are interesting.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.917
-There's no question about that.
-Yep.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.125
This is all really exciting

12:24.250 --> 12:27.333
because it's always been
suggested that the Money Pit,

12:27.500 --> 12:30.625
perhaps there were multiple
treasure cache locations.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.000
And now, we are finding that

12:33.167 --> 12:35.167
the muon detected evidence of it

12:35.375 --> 12:37.208
and suggestions of work

12:37.375 --> 12:40.500
at various elevations
all around the Money Pit.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.667
Does it strongly suggest
the possibility

12:43.875 --> 12:46.500
that there are more than one
location in the Money Pit?

12:46.708 --> 12:49.667
Yes. In my opinion,
it does suggest that.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.417
Well, for me,

12:51.542 --> 12:55.000
we've always believed that
it's only by introducing

12:55.167 --> 12:57.500
new technologies that this
will ultimately get solved.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.625
And it's by working together

12:59.792 --> 13:01.167
that, ultimately,
we might be able to solve

13:01.375 --> 13:03.000
a 228-year-old mystery.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.500
I think I speak for everyone.

13:05.708 --> 13:07.375
-Thank you both very much.
-Our pleasure.

13:07.542 --> 13:08.792
So, I think
we better get after it.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.667
-Fantastic. Great.
-Thank you, everybody.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.875
MARTY:
Talk to you all later. Goodbye.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.333
NARRATOR:
The following morning,

13:21.542 --> 13:25.875
as representatives from Dumas
continue excavating spoils

13:26.042 --> 13:28.167
from underneath
the Garden Shaft...

13:28.333 --> 13:31.208
-STEVE: So, we're currently
set up on L-14.
-TERRY: Yeah.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.167
We're gonna put some
of these areas to either rest

13:33.375 --> 13:34.542
or we're gonna find
what we're looking for.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.667
Exactly so. All right.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.792
NARRATOR:
...and while drilling begins
in a new borehole

13:39.958 --> 13:42.083
known as L-14,
where Aladdin's Cave

13:42.292 --> 13:45.500
sets some 160 feet
underground...

13:45.625 --> 13:48.250
-PETER: Seems you made
a lot of progress.
-HELEN: Yeah.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.208
As you can see, we're getting
deeper down into it.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.167
PETER:
Yeah. Okay.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.375
NARRATOR:
...Peter Fornetti
and Jack Begley

13:54.542 --> 13:56.833
join archaeologist Helen Sheldon

13:57.042 --> 13:59.792
and other members
of the team on Lot 5.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.667
They are continuing
their investigation

14:02.875 --> 14:05.000
of a mysterious
stone foundation,

14:05.167 --> 14:07.000
a feature which has been dated

14:07.167 --> 14:09.333
to the same era
as the Garden Shaft,

14:09.542 --> 14:12.958
and which appears to have been
deliberately buried.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.375
Whatever this was,
the fill indicates

14:16.583 --> 14:18.667
that it was buried

14:18.833 --> 14:20.250
mid to late 1700s.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.333
-Yeah.
-JACK: But that means
that someone buried this

14:23.542 --> 14:26.500
around the discovery time
of the Money Pit or

14:26.625 --> 14:27.917
maybe even just before.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.833
Well, see,
the interesting thing is,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.167
like, as we get into the
middle of it, the rubble fill

14:32.333 --> 14:35.250
in the middle is obviously
post-construction.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.042
That's, like, abandonment
of whatever this feature is.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.208
So, the feature itself
is earlier than that.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.583
-Yeah.
-Right?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.292
So, we need to get down
to the bottom

14:43.458 --> 14:44.667
and see if there's anything
remaining on the bottom

14:44.875 --> 14:46.417
-under there.
-Mm-hmm.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.833
So, Helen, what would be
the best use of Jack and I?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.833
Um, Jack's really good
at screening.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.458
-I love it. Yeah.
-Yep.

14:52.667 --> 14:53.833
You can do that. Um,

14:54.000 --> 14:55.833
-you join Lindy in that unit.
-Yep.

14:56.042 --> 14:57.458
And just start troweling away,
and we'll find something.

14:57.667 --> 14:58.917
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Yep.

14:59.042 --> 15:00.667
-Let's get to it.
-Okay.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.125
NARRATOR:
While Peter, Moya, and Lindy

15:03.333 --> 15:05.125
carefully remove
earth and sediments

15:05.333 --> 15:06.958
from the bottom of the feature,

15:07.125 --> 15:09.542
Jack will sift through them
with a screen

15:09.708 --> 15:14.000
to search for any
important clues or artifacts.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.250
Wow.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.625
-Hey, Moya.
-MOYA: Yeah?

15:26.833 --> 15:28.333
I found a bit of metal.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.833
Oh, wow. Thank you.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.917
JACK:
I think it's like
a staple or something.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.958
MOYA:
Yeah. To me,
it kind of almost looks

15:35.042 --> 15:36.083
like a chain link.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.042
JACK: Oh.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.167
I don't know.
What do you think, Helen?

15:40.375 --> 15:41.542
It's kind of...

15:41.708 --> 15:43.417
Let me see it. (grunts)

15:46.250 --> 15:49.042
Yeah, it is more like chain link
that's been fused together.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.375
NARRATOR:
A piece of chain link?

15:51.542 --> 15:55.250
Found in the rectangular
stone feature on Lot 5?

15:55.417 --> 15:58.375
Could it be a clue
that a heavy object

15:58.500 --> 16:02.167
was once hauled away from
or into this structure?

16:02.333 --> 16:04.083
HELEN:
We can CT this back in the lab

16:04.250 --> 16:07.167
and see if that's an actual
link-linkage in there

16:07.292 --> 16:08.500
under all the corrosion.

16:08.667 --> 16:09.500
MOYA:
And get it cleaned off

16:09.708 --> 16:10.958
to see what it looks like.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.167
-Thanks, Jack. Good find.
-JACK: Oh, for sure.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.875
I'm really hoping,
right at the bottom layer,

16:16.042 --> 16:18.792
we find something cool
that really helps show

16:18.917 --> 16:22.125
this wasn't a domestic site
but military

16:22.250 --> 16:24.500
-or something like that.
-Yeah. Yeah.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.708
PETER:
Well, there's only
one way to find out,

16:26.833 --> 16:28.750
-and that's for us
to keep digging.
-HELEN: Keep digging.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.625
NARRATOR:
As the investigation
on Lot 5 continues...

16:33.042 --> 16:34.750
GARY:
Where there's muck,
there's money.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.417
(Charles laughs)

16:36.542 --> 16:38.833
NARRATOR:
...back in the Money Pit area,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.375
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

16:41.500 --> 16:44.833
and Oak Island historian
Charles Barkhouse

16:45.042 --> 16:47.333
prepare to search through
the spoils that have

16:47.458 --> 16:51.000
recently been removed
from below the Garden Shaft.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.833
I wasn't joking, mate,
when I said we was

16:53.042 --> 16:54.125
gonna get stuck in.

16:54.292 --> 16:56.000
Oh, we are gonna get stuck in.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.667
And it smells like treasure.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.042
You know, Gary, I've got to
be honest, I was hoping treasure

17:00.208 --> 17:01.583
would smell
a little different than this.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.708
Oh, it will smell good, mate,

17:03.875 --> 17:05.125
when we're holding it
in our hands.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.167
But seriously, mate,

17:07.375 --> 17:10.792
this is the material
that I'm interested in

17:10.917 --> 17:12.500
because, last year,
we got those hits...

17:12.667 --> 17:14.375
-Yeah.
-...at the bottom
of the Garden Shaft,

17:14.542 --> 17:16.000
those nonferrous hits.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.125
All right.

17:19.958 --> 17:23.500
Oh, that's
the best sounding target.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.000
That's a nonferrous, yeah.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.500
-Really?
-Yep.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.208
NARRATOR:
Just before the team
was forced to halt

17:29.375 --> 17:31.875
their search operations
last winter,

17:32.042 --> 17:35.167
Gary, Rick, and Marty
obtained evidence

17:35.250 --> 17:36.750
of possible
precious metals in the mud

17:36.917 --> 17:39.292
several feet below
the Garden Shaft.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.708
If we're in here, mate, we are
gonna pull them out today.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.333
-So, let's get at it.
-Yeah.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.792
All right. Let's see
what we've got in here.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.417
NARRATOR:
Now, it is Gary
and Charles' hope

17:51.542 --> 17:53.375
that they will make
an important discovery

17:53.542 --> 17:57.167
that appeared to be
just out of reach last year.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.333
Even though I know it's iron,
it's coming out.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.375
-It's coming out. Okay.
-Yeah.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.042
I'll try pinpointing it, mate.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.292
Want me to dig it?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.333
I'm nearly there, mate.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.333
Ooh, what's this?

18:23.167 --> 18:24.667
Big chunk.

18:24.750 --> 18:25.792
It's here.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.917
NARRATOR:
While searching
through the spoils unearthed

18:28.042 --> 18:29.667
from the bottom
of the Garden Shaft...

18:29.792 --> 18:32.667
Some kind of, like, metal wedge?

18:32.792 --> 18:36.208
NARRATOR: ...Gary Drayton
and Charles Barkhouse have

18:36.375 --> 18:39.167
just found
a potentially important clue.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.458
GARY:
What do you think?

18:42.375 --> 18:44.667
CHARLES:
You know what that reminds
me of? You know that,

18:44.792 --> 18:47.500
when you put an axe handle
into a wooden staff, right?

18:47.667 --> 18:49.792
They put a wedge in the top
to drive it in to kind of

18:50.000 --> 18:51.625
-lock it in?
-Yeah.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.167
NARRATOR:
A possible metal wedge
from an axe

18:54.292 --> 18:56.167
found more than 80 feet deep

18:56.333 --> 18:58.083
near the bottom
of the Garden Shaft?

18:58.250 --> 18:59.625
CHARLES:
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.042
NARRATOR:
Could it have been left behind

19:01.167 --> 19:02.125
by those who built the structure

19:02.292 --> 19:05.250
as early as 1735?

19:05.417 --> 19:08.667
If so, might it be
an important clue

19:08.875 --> 19:12.000
that may help determine
just who they were?

19:12.083 --> 19:15.042
All right.
That's going in the pouch.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.333
All of this stuff will go back
to Emma in the lab.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.875
There might be a little
diamond in the rough.

19:20.042 --> 19:22.667
Literally in the rough.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.000
CHARLES:
If we could find something
like that, that'd be great.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.375
GARY:
I think we're done, mate.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.333
We'll wait for this to dry out

19:28.458 --> 19:31.250
and then see if there's anything
hiding right at the bottom.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.958
CHARLES:
Sounds like a plan.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.042
GARY:
All right, mate. Good digging.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.167
NARRATOR:
While Gary and Charles
take their discovery back

19:38.292 --> 19:40.917
to the Oak Island laboratory
for analysis,

19:41.083 --> 19:42.375
just to the west,

19:42.542 --> 19:44.167
in the Money Pit area...

19:44.292 --> 19:47.083
TERRY: Hopefully, we'll get down
into the cavern.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.708
The cave could turn into
something very interesting.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.000
NARRATOR:
...other members of the team

19:50.208 --> 19:53.000
continue drilling borehole L-14,

19:53.167 --> 19:56.000
several feet southwest
of the Garden Shaft.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.417
So, we're gonna have a new hole,

19:58.583 --> 20:00.042
new location in the cavity.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.750
NARRATOR:
A borehole where they hope

20:01.917 --> 20:05.208
to encounter a possible
treasure chamber

20:05.375 --> 20:08.875
160 feet underground
known as "Aladdin's Cave."

20:09.083 --> 20:11.375
SCOTT: We may see something
that we didn't see before.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.625
Yeah, it was a relatively large,
man-sized cavern.

20:14.792 --> 20:17.708
But this hole's
gonna tell the tale.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.208
-A big void?
-Oh, yeah.

20:29.375 --> 20:32.000
STEVE:
We have Mike coming over.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.500
TERRY:
Hey, Mike.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.292
So, I'm at, uh...
I'm at 142 and half,

20:36.500 --> 20:38.333
and I think I've hit a void
or something soft.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.667
-Do you want me
to keep pushing deeper?
-Yeah.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.333
Let's get an idea
of where it's open.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.042
-All right.
-Okay?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.292
-The plot thickens.
-The plot thickens.

20:47.458 --> 20:51.500
NARRATOR:
A void at a depth
of just 142 feet?

20:52.542 --> 20:55.417
Having previously encountered
evidence of Aladdin's Cave

20:55.583 --> 20:58.875
at 160 feet, is it possible

20:59.042 --> 21:00.625
that the top of the cavern--

21:00.833 --> 21:03.958
where the team has detected
trace evidence of gold--

21:04.083 --> 21:07.625
sits at a much higher elevation
than previously thought?

21:07.750 --> 21:09.375
TERRY:
Uh, look, that's interesting.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.208
The roof could be
a little higher in this area.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.333
SCOTT:
Yeah. I mean,
when you look at the 3D

21:13.500 --> 21:15.792
model of it, it's not
a regular shape around that.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.083
So, I mean, I'm not surprised
to find it higher.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.500
Yeah.

21:21.542 --> 21:24.417
MARTY:
Aladdin's Cave remains
very interesting to me because

21:24.583 --> 21:26.667
I can't think
of a geologic reason it's there.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.417
And yet, it is there.

21:28.542 --> 21:30.333
I think it's plausible

21:30.458 --> 21:32.458
that Aladdin's Cave

21:32.542 --> 21:36.375
could either have been
an original repository,

21:36.500 --> 21:40.417
or it could be
where the Money Pit collapsed.

21:40.542 --> 21:43.333
Either way, there could be
something valuable in that cave.

21:43.500 --> 21:47.167
So, I'm down to 148,
and there's nothing in there.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.500
-Open space?
-Open space.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.125
-TERRY: All right.
-STEVE: That's what we want.

21:51.292 --> 21:52.542
TERRY:
Thank you.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.333
SCOTT: I think this hole
was a great success.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.500
We wanted to get down
into that cavity and, uh,

21:57.708 --> 21:59.500
find some space there
where we could use the camera

21:59.708 --> 22:01.000
and this new sonar that we have.

22:01.167 --> 22:02.708
Our sonar is still a week away,

22:02.833 --> 22:04.708
so it's kind of why
we want to drill this hole now.

22:04.833 --> 22:07.333
Give it time to settle out, and
it can give us a clearer image.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.417
NARRATOR:
In the coming days,

22:09.583 --> 22:13.667
the Oak Island team will further
investigate Aladdin's Cave

22:13.875 --> 22:16.542
with both
a high-definition camera

22:16.708 --> 22:19.167
and a three-dimensional
sonar device

22:19.292 --> 22:23.083
after the clouds of silt and
sediment have been given time

22:23.250 --> 22:27.708
to settle at the bottom of
the potentially man-made cavern.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.708
We are not leaving
this island this year

22:29.875 --> 22:32.000
without having a go
at this Aladdin's Cave.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.500
We know
that there are precious metals

22:34.708 --> 22:37.833
dissolved in the water
that came out of Aladdin's Cave.

22:37.958 --> 22:40.708
Well, geez, I mean,
if you add those things up,

22:40.833 --> 22:43.708
it sounds like a cavity
that has treasure in it.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.542
Step one was a success.

22:45.708 --> 22:48.000
TERRY:
Yeah. L-14 is going

22:48.167 --> 22:49.833
to yield up some secrets
very shortly.

22:50.042 --> 22:51.833
SCOTT:
Now, it's just a matter
of ground-truthing it.

22:52.042 --> 22:53.833
TERRY:
Exactly.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.500
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

22:58.708 --> 23:01.208
ROGER:
There we go. Looking good.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.833
NARRATOR:
...as representatives
from Dumas Contracting Limited

23:04.000 --> 23:06.500
continue their work
in the Garden Shaft...

23:06.708 --> 23:09.917
-RICK: More flags I see, Gary.
-GARY: Yeah, mate.

23:10.042 --> 23:13.250
-This is the coin zone, mate.
-This is the treasure zone.

23:13.417 --> 23:14.500
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina

23:14.708 --> 23:17.500
and Gary Drayton
arrive on Lot 5,

23:17.667 --> 23:21.250
located on the western side
of the island.

23:21.417 --> 23:23.833
They are returning
to search the area

23:24.000 --> 23:27.750
where they have previously
discovered five ancient coins,

23:27.917 --> 23:29.958
three of which are
of Roman origin

23:30.083 --> 23:34.500
and have been determined to be
approximately 2,000 years old.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.500
And I've got to be honest.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.708
A couple of these flags sound
like they could be coins.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.250
-That would be fantastic.
-(laughs)

23:42.417 --> 23:45.208
-Here you go.
-All right. See what we've got.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.583
-All right, first one up.
-(beeping)

23:47.750 --> 23:51.000
-RICK: That ain't bad.
-Good sounding target, mate.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.042
Just there.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.417
(groans)

24:03.208 --> 24:04.667
(grunts)

24:07.375 --> 24:09.208
Well, that's not
what we're looking for.

24:09.417 --> 24:12.667
Nope. Not unless
it's on top of a treasure chest.

24:14.958 --> 24:16.167
All right, let's see.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.458
(beeping)

24:18.583 --> 24:20.667
-Ooh. Still in the hole.
-Yeah.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.542
-RICK:
It's iron though, isn't it?
-Nope.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.708
-RICK: There she be.
-Yup.

24:29.625 --> 24:31.292
It's in my hand.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.917
Now, we both know
that was down there.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.417
That's deep target.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.167
What's that?

24:40.333 --> 24:42.208
GARY:
What the heck is this?

24:46.708 --> 24:48.042
-RICK: What's that?
-GARY: I like the shape of it.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.333
NARRATOR:
Near the middle

24:49.500 --> 24:51.167
of Lot 5 on Oak Island...

24:51.375 --> 24:52.667
GARY:
See that edge there, mate?

24:52.792 --> 24:53.958
RICK:
Can't be a button.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.833
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

24:57.000 --> 24:59.208
have just made
a curious discovery.

24:59.375 --> 25:03.083
What've we got, mate, is that
a bit of ancientness in that.

25:04.208 --> 25:06.375
GARY: Oh!

25:06.542 --> 25:08.708
Ooh! It's here. Old coin.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.167
It looks like
a really old coin, mate.

25:11.333 --> 25:14.458
Look at that. Oh!

25:14.625 --> 25:16.167
-RICK: That is thick.
-Ooh!

25:16.250 --> 25:17.708
Yeah, that is thick, mate.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.792
-GARY: Oh!
-That is beautiful.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.833
Wow. Look at that.
There's no mistaking that.

25:23.958 --> 25:25.667
-Yeah.
-That ain't no button.

25:25.833 --> 25:28.500
NARRATOR:
Could Gary and Rick be correct

25:28.708 --> 25:31.750
that they have found
another potentially ancient coin

25:31.875 --> 25:33.458
on Lot 5?

25:33.625 --> 25:35.875
If so, could it offer
more evidence

25:36.042 --> 25:38.792
that this area may be
directly connected

25:38.958 --> 25:42.583
to the 228-year-old
treasure mystery?

25:42.750 --> 25:46.000
We know, mate, when we pulled
those ancient coins out

25:46.167 --> 25:47.750
in this area before,

25:47.917 --> 25:49.458
they've just got that look
and feel about them.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.167
Let me... Let me feel

25:51.375 --> 25:52.667
-how heavy it is.
-Here you go, mate.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.333
-Ooh, it's heavy.
-Yeah, that is.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.292
And that baby was down there.

25:58.458 --> 26:01.167
You know, what the heck
happened here, Gary?

26:01.333 --> 26:05.583
Yeah. I mean, there's some
secrets still in this area here.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.708
RICK:
As the work on Lot 5
continues to evolve,

26:08.833 --> 26:10.833
I continue to be puzzled by it.

26:10.958 --> 26:14.625
We have always sought
to find connective tissue

26:14.792 --> 26:18.750
between the lots and
the original depositional work.

26:18.917 --> 26:21.125
And so, I think
that's the hope on Lot 5.

26:21.292 --> 26:24.167
Once all of the artifacts
are analyzed,

26:24.333 --> 26:29.250
then you will be able to say
with some sort of clarity that,

26:29.417 --> 26:32.708
"Yes, this presents an answer."

26:32.917 --> 26:34.500
-That goes back to the lab.
-Yeah.

26:34.667 --> 26:36.000
That goes back to the lab, mate.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.833
So, we have got
to put this in the bag.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.333
RICK:
That's cool. Very cool.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.333
GARY:
Bloody fantastic.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.833
NARRATOR:
The following morning
as operations continue

26:50.000 --> 26:52.667
in both the Garden Shaft
and Aladdin's Cave

26:52.875 --> 26:54.708
in the Money Pit area...

26:54.875 --> 26:58.333
RICK: So, Gary and I happened
to be out on Lot 5 up

26:58.500 --> 27:00.833
into the areas where we had
found the Roman coins, right?

27:00.958 --> 27:04.167
-Mm-hmm. Good area.
-Well,

27:04.333 --> 27:05.542
we came across this.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.542
NARRATOR:
...Rick joins Marty

27:06.708 --> 27:08.417
in the Interpretive Centre

27:08.583 --> 27:10.917
for a meeting
with archaeologist Laird Niven

27:11.083 --> 27:13.583
and archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan,

27:13.708 --> 27:15.208
who have both had
the opportunity

27:15.333 --> 27:19.958
to examine the artifact
discovered one day ago on Lot 5.

27:20.125 --> 27:23.000
We were ecstatic when... when
this came out of the ground.

27:23.125 --> 27:27.250
We thought, "Wow.
This is really something."

27:28.208 --> 27:31.167
MARTY:
I mean, Laird,
what do you think it is?

27:31.333 --> 27:33.417
When I first saw it, I knew...

27:33.583 --> 27:35.000
-It's lead, right?
-Mm-hmm.

27:35.125 --> 27:37.625
LAIRD:
So, I discounted coin.

27:37.792 --> 27:40.208
My best guess was
that it was a bag seal.

27:40.417 --> 27:43.333
-Oh. Another one of those.
-Yeah.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.125
NARRATOR:
Dating back to as early
as the 13th century,

27:47.292 --> 27:50.917
lead bag seals were fasteners
used across Europe

27:51.083 --> 27:52.667
to package large quantities

27:52.875 --> 27:56.292
of both industrial
and military goods.

27:56.458 --> 28:00.667
Three years ago, the team
discovered a lead bag seal

28:00.875 --> 28:03.958
just west of the swamp
on Lot 32.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.875
Incredibly, lead isotope
testing indicated

28:08.000 --> 28:09.833
it was a compositional match

28:10.042 --> 28:13.375
not only to the 14th-century
lead barter token

28:13.583 --> 28:15.750
found one year ago on Lot 5

28:15.875 --> 28:18.958
but also
the 14th-century lead cross

28:19.083 --> 28:23.500
that was unearthed
at Smith's Cove in 2017.

28:23.667 --> 28:26.375
RICK:
So, what made you come

28:26.542 --> 28:29.167
to a bag seal assessment?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.917
Um, it was that little...
the little, cut section there.

28:32.125 --> 28:36.167
Because bag seals are two
lead circles brought together

28:36.292 --> 28:37.333
and then stamped.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.125
MARTY:
Well, I'm guessing

28:39.292 --> 28:40.833
we have results
from the machines over here

28:41.000 --> 28:43.958
-and our own Emma.
-I do.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.250
NARRATOR:
Earlier this morning,

28:46.375 --> 28:49.917
Emma analyzed the new discovery
made on Lot 5

28:50.083 --> 28:53.000
using the X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer,

28:53.167 --> 28:55.625
a device that emits
non-destructive radiation

28:55.792 --> 28:57.833
in order to determine

28:57.917 --> 29:00.792
the elemental composition
of objects.

29:00.958 --> 29:03.667
So, this is the scanning XRF.

29:03.792 --> 29:06.792
EMMA:
So, it is lead. It has

29:06.958 --> 29:08.875
very little impurities,
but it does have

29:09.042 --> 29:11.833
some iron impurities
and a little bit of copper.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.833
And I did get a report
on another bale seal or bag seal

29:16.042 --> 29:18.000
-that you guys found.
-Mm-hmm.

29:18.167 --> 29:20.375
And it doesn't match with that.

29:20.542 --> 29:26.042
So, I can say that it's not
exactly the same composition.

29:26.208 --> 29:30.000
But the most interesting part
is the image

29:30.167 --> 29:32.000
on the front surface there.

29:35.375 --> 29:38.250
-RICK: Definitely letters,
that's for sure.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

29:38.458 --> 29:42.583
And the first letter that was
obvious to us was the "K."

29:42.750 --> 29:44.625
MARTY:
Oh, those letters.

29:44.792 --> 29:47.625
-"E" is it? I see an "E."
-LAIRD: Yup.

29:47.792 --> 29:50.250
This should be "K-E-R."

29:50.417 --> 29:52.375
And we were having a hard time
tracking down

29:52.542 --> 29:53.875
what "C-K-E-R" Was.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.417
But we were able
to find an exact match.

29:58.917 --> 30:00.583
The is the example I found.

30:00.708 --> 30:04.542
And it says "I. Lloyd"
on the top,

30:04.708 --> 30:06.458
and the "I" is actually "J."

30:06.583 --> 30:08.333
"I. Lloyd Packers,"

30:08.458 --> 30:11.042
-and on the bottom,
it says, "London."
-MARTY: Oh.

30:11.208 --> 30:13.375
So, this is
a cloth packer's seal

30:13.583 --> 30:16.250
from the 1700s.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.708
They were the people--
they got the cloth

30:18.875 --> 30:21.000
and literally packed them
into the bales.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.000
-Oh.
-And then sealed them.

30:23.167 --> 30:26.083
The bale it was sealing
was about half a ton.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.083
-Wow.
-MARTY: So, half ton.

30:29.292 --> 30:30.833
I mean, would the military
use such a thing?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.792
If you had a bunch of soldiers,
they need cloth.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.125
LAIRD:
Yeah, and ironically,

30:36.292 --> 30:39.167
this company was listed
as army packers.

30:39.375 --> 30:43.000
-Oh.
-So, there's a direct connection
with the military.

30:43.208 --> 30:44.333
Wow.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.833
I haven't been able
to find a great date

30:46.042 --> 30:48.208
for the, uh... for the company.

30:48.375 --> 30:52.125
We found one entry
from 1808, giving

30:52.292 --> 30:55.083
their address in London,
but I think it's previous.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.667
MARTY:
Why do you think it's older?

30:57.875 --> 31:00.333
It was the use
of "I" instead of "J."

31:02.167 --> 31:05.917
It's "I. Lodge,"
and the "I" is for "John."

31:06.042 --> 31:07.833
So, that usage
went out of fashion?

31:07.958 --> 31:11.500
Yeah. Js came into use
in, like, 1524.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.667
So, it's an older use.

31:13.833 --> 31:16.375
It's an artifact in itself.

31:16.542 --> 31:20.167
Then that would imply
that it could be very old.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.250
-Much older.
-MARTY: Still potentially means

31:22.375 --> 31:26.125
anytime between 1500,
and let's say, 1800,

31:26.250 --> 31:29.375
this bag seal arrived
on Oak Island.

31:29.542 --> 31:31.333
-Is that fair?
-Yes.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.667
NARRATOR:
A bag seal designed
for packaging

31:34.833 --> 31:37.708
large quantities of goods
for the British military?

31:37.875 --> 31:39.417
Dating to as early as the 1500s?

31:39.625 --> 31:42.583
And found on Lot 5?

31:42.750 --> 31:46.000
Because the team has found
artifacts and structures

31:46.125 --> 31:50.208
on Lot 5 that date back
as much as 2,000 years,

31:50.375 --> 31:52.833
could this bag seal have
been left by people

31:53.000 --> 31:55.375
who hid something
of great value on Oak Island

31:55.542 --> 31:57.917
prior to 1795?

31:58.083 --> 32:00.958
Or was it left
by someone who came here

32:01.167 --> 32:03.708
in order to search
for the fabled treasure?

32:03.875 --> 32:06.208
Look, is this interesting? Yes.

32:06.375 --> 32:10.667
Does it provide pathways
to-to learn more? Sure.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.167
Find out about that company.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.625
Well, and there's a lot
of stuff, Rick, adding up

32:14.750 --> 32:17.417
to saying something dramatically
different than homesteading.

32:17.625 --> 32:20.917
-It does. And then,
the military component.
-MARTY: Okay.

32:21.042 --> 32:23.833
Rick, go grab Gary
and find some more stuff.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.792
-(laughs)
-Let's figure this thing out.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.667
RICK:
I agree.

32:31.708 --> 32:33.042
JAMIE:
How are you guys doing?

32:33.208 --> 32:35.000
-BOTH: Good.
-Everything's been great.

32:35.167 --> 32:37.125
-We're, uh, we're about
halfway through here.
-Okay.

32:37.333 --> 32:40.125
-We're starting to get close
to our round feature, so...
-Mm-hmm.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.000
We'll keep walking
the transects and

32:42.167 --> 32:43.750
gather some more data.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.167
NARRATOR: At the northern region

32:45.333 --> 32:47.167
of Lot 5 on Oak Island...

32:47.333 --> 32:50.000
LAIRD:
These instruments
are really important for us.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.167
NARRATOR: ...Craig Tester
joins Laird Niven

32:52.375 --> 32:55.917
and Jamie Kouba,
where they have just begun

32:56.042 --> 32:58.167
a new underground
scanning operation

32:58.292 --> 33:01.292
near the mysterious
circular feature.

33:02.417 --> 33:06.708
This electro-magnetic
induction instrument actually

33:06.875 --> 33:10.500
forces a field into the ground,
which then reacts off of things.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.542
All right. Okay.

33:12.708 --> 33:15.500
NARRATOR:
Following the recent
discoveries within

33:15.667 --> 33:17.500
and near the stone depression,

33:17.667 --> 33:22.167
which have been dated to between
the 14th and 18th centuries,

33:22.333 --> 33:25.500
the Oak Island team has
obtained a device

33:25.667 --> 33:30.417
known as Geonics EM38B from
the anthropology department

33:30.583 --> 33:34.167
of St. Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

33:34.333 --> 33:38.333
Things like, say, fire can
change the geochemical

33:38.542 --> 33:40.000
properties of the ground

33:40.167 --> 33:42.000
-and actually make it
more magnetic.
-Okay.

33:42.083 --> 33:45.667
So, yeah, I'm hoping to
find some areas of interest.

33:45.792 --> 33:47.292
Okay.

33:47.833 --> 33:50.583
NARRATOR:
By emitting magnetic
pulses into the ground,

33:50.708 --> 33:55.333
the EM-38B can detect not
only buried metal artifacts,

33:55.542 --> 33:58.333
as well as wooden
or stone structures,

33:58.542 --> 34:02.417
but also so-called
"susceptible" qualities,

34:02.542 --> 34:04.958
such as changes
in layers of soil

34:05.167 --> 34:07.708
that were created
by human activity.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.458
Once you collect the data,

34:09.625 --> 34:11.667
we'll get it sent
out to St. Mary's, right?

34:11.833 --> 34:13.333
-And get it finally processing?
-Yes.

34:13.542 --> 34:14.708
-Absolutely.
-Okay. Well,
why don't you run it.

34:14.917 --> 34:16.667
-Perfect.
-If you find anything,

34:16.875 --> 34:18.375
-let us know. Okay.
-I will.

34:22.250 --> 34:25.000
CRAIG:
We've been exploring
the circular feature,

34:25.208 --> 34:27.625
trying to determine
what that is.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.750
But we need to keep
gathering information.

34:31.792 --> 34:35.000
What else is in the area
under the ground?

34:35.208 --> 34:39.417
And so, we're looking
for structures, artifacts,

34:39.583 --> 34:41.375
and hopefully,

34:41.542 --> 34:43.958
they can determine

34:44.167 --> 34:46.708
who built it, and-and what for.

34:47.917 --> 34:51.042
-(beeping)
-Huh.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.917
That's... that's actually
kind of interesting.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.583
Hey, guys.

34:59.958 --> 35:01.250
-Hey.
-Okay. So, what'd you find?

35:01.417 --> 35:03.208
So, I just paused it here
because I didn't

35:03.375 --> 35:06.042
want to keep moving on,
but check this out.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.625
Notice what's happening
with those lines?

35:09.792 --> 35:11.583
Yeah. Separating more.

35:11.708 --> 35:13.792
There's definitely
something happening with

35:13.958 --> 35:17.833
both the conductivity
and the susceptibility, so...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.292
-Okay.
-It's in an interesting
location.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.708
It really is. Yeah. This close
to that round feature.

35:23.875 --> 35:27.042
LAIRD:
It could be a structure.
This is what we're looking for.

35:27.250 --> 35:31.375
I'm actually excited about
the anomaly, particularly given

35:31.500 --> 35:34.250
its proximity
to the round feature.

35:34.417 --> 35:36.458
I think it's related
to the round feature.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.500
I think it's something
that would have been used

35:38.667 --> 35:40.958
at the same time
as the round feature.

35:41.083 --> 35:43.417
So, people settled on Lot 5

35:43.583 --> 35:45.875
at a time that we have
no record of anyone else

35:46.042 --> 35:47.375
being on the island.

35:47.583 --> 35:49.125
Yeah, running several
more lines will give me

35:49.250 --> 35:50.833
an idea on how wide it is.

35:51.042 --> 35:52.208
LAIRD:
But the data has

35:52.375 --> 35:54.833
to go and get processed

35:54.958 --> 35:58.583
before we can actually get
a visual idea of what's there.

35:58.708 --> 36:03.292
Each of the lines are set up
at about 50 centimeters apart.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.083
If we're seeing something here,
it'll tell us.

36:06.292 --> 36:07.083
Are we seeing it
on the next line

36:07.250 --> 36:08.250
and the next line?

36:08.417 --> 36:09.833
And that'll let us know how big

36:10.042 --> 36:11.792
this potential anomaly is,

36:11.958 --> 36:13.333
and where exactly it's located.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.125
LAIRDD:
That's what I'm waiting for.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.542
Because we'll be able
to pinpoint where to excavate.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.417
-Yeah.
-CRAIG: Okay.

36:19.583 --> 36:22.208
-We'll, keep after it.
-That sounds good.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.542
-Okay.
-All right. Thank you.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.667
Bye, guys. See you later.

36:25.875 --> 36:27.167
CRAIG:
Well, good start.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.542
LAIRD:
Yeah. I think it's great.

36:30.708 --> 36:33.542
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

36:34.583 --> 36:37.750
-RICK: Morning, Craig.
-CRAIG: Hey, guys.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.750
NARRATOR:
...Craig Tester joins
Rick Lagina

36:39.917 --> 36:42.750
and other members of the team
via video conference

36:42.917 --> 36:46.417
for an important meeting
in the war room.

36:46.583 --> 36:49.875
Getting reports like this carbon
dating is kind of exciting.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.083
You know, it's something
we look forward to

36:52.208 --> 36:53.500
because we were hoping,

36:53.667 --> 36:55.333
and maybe these reports
will differentiate

36:55.500 --> 36:57.458
between searcher work
and perhaps

36:57.625 --> 36:58.833
original, depositional work.

37:00.583 --> 37:03.167
NARRATOR:
Craig has just received

37:03.375 --> 37:04.875
a carbon-dating report

37:05.042 --> 37:07.958
on a wood sample
collected one week ago

37:08.125 --> 37:10.250
from a depth of some 100 feet

37:10.375 --> 37:13.667
in borehole C5N-27.

37:13.875 --> 37:17.625
A borehole where the team
encountered a mysterious tunnel

37:17.792 --> 37:20.042
believed to run
below the Garden Shaft

37:20.208 --> 37:22.667
and into the Baby Blob.

37:23.708 --> 37:27.000
Why don't you, uh, give us
the results, please?

37:27.208 --> 37:28.375
CRAIG:
Sure thing.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.292
We had a wood chip.

37:30.417 --> 37:33.500
We sent it out to get
a carbon date on it.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.083
And the, uh,

37:35.250 --> 37:38.167
specific brackets are 53.2%:

37:38.333 --> 37:41.500
1726 to 1811.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.875
25.5%:

37:45.042 --> 37:48.708
1644 to 1694.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.167
And 16.7%:

37:51.333 --> 37:54.375
1917 and 1950.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.833
There's a high probability
this wood's

37:58.042 --> 38:00.000
the outer edge of a tree.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.333
-Right.
-So, I tend to think these dates
I'm giving you

38:02.500 --> 38:04.000
are fairly close

38:04.167 --> 38:05.875
to the time it was chopped down.

38:06.792 --> 38:11.250
So, to me, you know,
the results from C.5N-27

38:11.417 --> 38:12.417
mean it-it really

38:12.542 --> 38:15.000
puts it into pre-searcher.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.500
I just think this could indicate

38:19.708 --> 38:21.958
that it's a, uh, original work.

38:22.083 --> 38:24.667
-RICK: Wowza.
-JACK: Whoa.

38:28.625 --> 38:29.917
This could indicate
that it's a original work.

38:30.083 --> 38:32.500
Wowza. (laughs)

38:32.708 --> 38:34.000
Well, that's good to hear.

38:34.125 --> 38:35.583
(laughter)

38:35.750 --> 38:37.583
NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,

38:37.750 --> 38:39.625
Craig Tester has just revealed

38:39.792 --> 38:43.500
carbon-dating results
which offer more evidence

38:43.708 --> 38:46.917
that the tunnel they have been
tracking below the Garden Shaft

38:47.083 --> 38:50.667
may very well be related
to the original Money Pit.

38:51.708 --> 38:53.333
Those dates line up
with the other dates

38:53.500 --> 38:55.333
we found on what we deemed
to be the same tunnel.

38:55.542 --> 38:59.458
D.5N26.5, they were
all 1600 to 1700s as well.

38:59.625 --> 39:03.042
Yes. And none of those
make sense for searcher.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.208
STEVE: I mean,
it's very exciting because

39:05.375 --> 39:07.167
it's starting to confirm
that this is probably all

39:07.333 --> 39:10.000
-one continuous tunnel.
-Yep.

39:10.208 --> 39:12.708
So, I recall that
in the Garden Shaft,

39:12.875 --> 39:15.292
we found a piece of wood
that dated to 1735.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.667
Yeah. And the Money Pit seems
to have been,

39:17.833 --> 39:19.833
at least from this data
and other data,

39:19.958 --> 39:24.667
built sometime in what,
the late 1600, early 1700s?

39:24.833 --> 39:27.500
There must be some sort
of a connection to the tunnel.

39:27.708 --> 39:29.833
-Yeah. I- I would agree.
-Yeah.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.958
I think the dating of
those wood chips, though,

39:33.167 --> 39:35.250
paints a compelling picture
for staying the course

39:35.417 --> 39:36.875
as far as deepening
the Garden Shaft goes.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.792
Because once we deepen
the Garden Shaft, and hopefully

39:39.958 --> 39:43.042
break into this tunnel, we might
have an open tunnel there.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.583
-Sure. Absolutely.
-JACK: Yeah.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.583
If it is original works
and a depositor tunnel,

39:47.708 --> 39:50.500
it could lead
to a new discovery,

39:50.708 --> 39:52.125
-or the treasure.
-RICK: Exactly.

39:53.542 --> 39:56.667
These new C-14 results

39:56.833 --> 40:00.500
certainly raise the level
of anticipation in the war room.

40:00.708 --> 40:03.500
I mean, we are engaged
in a process that will

40:03.667 --> 40:06.375
get us to that elevation
where this tunnel exists.

40:06.583 --> 40:11.833
Can we put our eyes and
our boots on original work?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.333
And this may represent
that opportunity.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.542
I'm quite pleased by
all of the efforts to date

40:17.708 --> 40:21.000
for one simple reason:
I came here wanting to prove

40:21.208 --> 40:23.500
to all of us, to myself
and to the world, literally,

40:23.708 --> 40:25.125
that Oak Island was real.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.042
And now, perhaps,
we are on the cusp

40:27.208 --> 40:29.500
of the answers, right?

40:29.708 --> 40:31.333
We've got a lot of work to do.

40:31.542 --> 40:34.125
We need to get after it.
So, thanks, Craig, for the data.

40:34.292 --> 40:36.167
-See you guys.
-See you, Craig.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.917
JACK:
Thanks for the info.

40:39.042 --> 40:41.667
NARRATOR:
For more than 200 years,

40:41.792 --> 40:45.667
Oak Island has defied all
who faithfully worked

40:45.875 --> 40:49.667
to unearth something
of great value in the Money Pit.

40:49.792 --> 40:52.000
Their only certainty was that

40:52.125 --> 40:53.625
someone went to great lengths

40:53.750 --> 40:57.167
to ensure that
it would never be found.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.875
But now, through their
equally determined efforts

41:02.083 --> 41:05.000
and disciplined
applications of science,

41:05.208 --> 41:08.667
Rick, Marty, Craig
and their team have made it

41:08.833 --> 41:12.583
all but certain that there
are multiple locations

41:12.750 --> 41:14.958
where treasure may lie buried.

41:15.083 --> 41:19.333
And nothing,
not even a deadly curse,

41:19.500 --> 41:21.833
can defy their will

41:22.000 --> 41:24.458
to solve the mystery.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.667
Next time, on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:28.833 --> 41:30.833
FIONA: What is this?
Oh, look at that.

41:30.958 --> 41:33.500
-Oh, my God!
-That looks like the handle
of something.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.833
We suspect
that it's from the 1700s.

41:36.042 --> 41:36.875
Even earlier.

41:37.042 --> 41:38.792
-Really?
-Absolutely.

41:38.958 --> 41:41.375
MARTY:
We have an opening
into this cavern.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.333
Yeah. It looks man-made.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.833
It's amazing.

41:45.042 --> 41:46.208
Okay, going in.

41:46.375 --> 41:47.542
MARTY:
We're all eager to see

41:47.708 --> 41:49.125
-Aladdin's Cave.
-ALEX: Stop!

41:49.250 --> 41:50.333
STEVE:
What is that? Wow.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.875
This is different.

41:52.042 --> 41:53.917
This is way different
than anything we've seen.
