01:59.520 --> 02:01.960
Oh fuck.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.440
She won't stop crying.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.680
Can you do your thing?

02:10.680 --> 02:11.840
Yep. Hang on.

02:15.519 --> 02:17.600
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.920
- She's just...
- Hey! What's the matter?

02:20.799 --> 02:22.160
Hey, why are you crying?

02:22.160 --> 02:24.160
I can't find anything

02:24.160 --> 02:26.920
that doesn't have sick,
or breast milk.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.880
- Or smell...
- Yes, I can do it too.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.519
Ah! Bwaaaaah!

02:30.519 --> 02:32.680
Oh, for f--

02:35.160 --> 02:36.720
Turtle! Oh my...

02:37.320 --> 02:40.280
Oh, well, you... you look like crap.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.600
Joanna? Why are you here?

02:42.600 --> 02:43.799
Otis called me.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.799
- Oh, my niece!
- Hi.

02:47.799 --> 02:51.239
When did you get so fucking tall? Shit.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.880
- You got her?
- I need to learn to not swear as much.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.440
You called my sister?

02:59.799 --> 03:00.799
We need help.

03:01.519 --> 03:02.799
We'll talk about it later.

03:02.799 --> 03:04.679
Wow! Your house is a mess!

03:04.679 --> 03:06.400
Can you grab my bags?

03:07.640 --> 03:10.760
Aren't you gonna shower?
Otis said you're starting a new job today.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.040
- How long are you staying, exactly?
- Well, as long as you need.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.519
Oh! Yes.

03:17.519 --> 03:19.239
- Oh, whee!
- No, she can't really...

03:19.239 --> 03:21.560
- Uh, she can't hold her head up yet.
- I know.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.799
I used to nanny for Bono.
I'm great with babies.

03:23.799 --> 03:26.440
- Weren't you sacked?
- That was because of the fire.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.320
- Not the kids.
- Oh.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.799
Anyway, go and have a shower.

03:30.799 --> 03:33.160
- Trust me. You need one.
- Huh.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.799
Mm-hmm.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.160
Okay.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.160
Is she doing okay? Uh...

03:43.160 --> 03:45.359
- She's not herself.
- Right.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.840
And, uh... who's Joy's dad?

03:49.519 --> 03:51.519
Don't ask her about it.
She gets very touchy.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.040
- I've gotta go.
- Bye.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.079
Hello, Joy. Hello.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.959
That's too much.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.640
How long do you think it'll take
to get some muscles?

04:26.320 --> 04:27.280
Excuse me?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.880
I'm just thinking about going to the gym.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.840
It's, like... it's good for your brain,
exercise, so I'm gonna try it.

04:34.479 --> 04:37.200
That's nice. And what's the real reason?

04:39.520 --> 04:43.320
So Maeve's... Maeve made friends
with this guy on her course called Tyrone,

04:43.320 --> 04:45.440
and he's... he's ripped.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.039
How ripped are we talking?

04:48.640 --> 04:49.840
- Do you wanna see?
- Yes.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.320
- Really?
- Yes.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.200
Oh my God! He is hot!

04:57.919 --> 05:00.200
W-- And so are you.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.440
In a quiet and soft, intelligent way.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.479
- Okay.
- Yeah. There's no competition.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.120
- Who cares about ripped bodies?
- Really?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.200
- No. Can I see that one more time?
- You're shit.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.200
I'm sorry. I'm lying. He is so hot.
My God, his body is insane!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.440
His biceps have biceps.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.120
Morning.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.680
Hey.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.760
Hey. I said, hey. Wait up!

05:26.400 --> 05:27.280
How are you?

05:27.919 --> 05:29.880
Oh, are you wanting
to book an appointment?

05:29.880 --> 05:33.760
It's me, Ruby Matthews.
We went to primary school together.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.080
I think you have me confused
with someone else. Have a great day.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.880
Baby, can we talk?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.039
Not today, Abbi.

05:53.039 --> 05:54.200
Are you okay?

05:54.200 --> 05:57.200
Yeah. We had a little fight,
but we'll be fine. It'll be fine.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.240
I think Roman and Abbi
are fighting.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.120
What's that?

06:03.120 --> 06:06.400
Oh, just an ally coming through.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.240
Hey.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.720
Why do you keep blanking me?
Thought we were cool.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.479
I'm just not ready to be your friend.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.120
Yet.

06:18.840 --> 06:19.880
Sorry.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.240
Whoo-hoo!

06:29.440 --> 06:30.919
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.

06:30.919 --> 06:33.640
No, it's fine. I am fine.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.039
Oh, thank you.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.039
I'm Gloria, by the way.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.799
- Michael.
- Nice aftershave, Michael.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.080
- I'm not wearing any.
- Lucky you.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.280
Your father wants to come over
and make dinner for us tonight.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.400
- Why?
- He's trying to make an effort.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.159
- You're not getting back together?
- No. We're not. I promise.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.120
That's fine, I guess.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.479
Oh, Adam.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.280
Remember not to mumble.

07:27.039 --> 07:27.919
Okay.

07:38.159 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.799
Um, what is with the original thing?
I thought O started her clinic first.

07:44.799 --> 07:47.120
There's no way
she came up with this on her own.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.640
She's obviously heard
about my clinic and copied me.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.599
What are you doing later?

07:51.599 --> 07:53.120
Shall we hang out? Play <i>Smash?</i>

07:53.120 --> 07:57.520
I'd love to, but my mum is making me go
to this baptism class after college.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.840
I'm kind of dreadin' it.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.120
How come?

08:01.679 --> 08:05.359
Just, I'm not out there.
It's like the only place I'm not anymore.

08:06.239 --> 08:07.960
Yeah, it's kind of messed up.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.520
I don't think you should go.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.200
Yeah, it's just... it's complicated.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.159
- I feel like my mum is under pressure--
- Yeah. Morning, Otis.

08:17.159 --> 08:18.080
Good morning.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.200
I saw your website.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.479
It was really cute.
Oh, you've got a new room.

08:22.479 --> 08:25.400
With biscuits.
And what's that? Mint water?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.200
How adorable. See ya.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.440
- Huh.
- She's really good.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.640
- Hello. Jenny, good to see you.
- Hmph.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.079
- Thanks for comin' again.
- Gah!

08:33.799 --> 08:34.679
Oh God.

08:36.120 --> 08:36.959
Oh.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.720
- It's you again.
- Hi.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.320
God, is this lift broken again?

08:45.320 --> 08:47.440
- You need to press the button.
- Oh.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.079
<i>Lift going up.</i>

08:53.959 --> 08:57.800
Isaac, sometimes I say the first thing
that pops into my head.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.560
And what I said the other day,
it was really, really stupid. I'm sorry.

09:02.199 --> 09:03.640
Maeve thinks we'd really get on,

09:03.640 --> 09:05.840
and I don't have many friends
now she's gone,

09:05.840 --> 09:08.000
so I was hoping
that maybe we could start again.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.600
Okay, let's start again.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.760
Hello. Yeah.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.640
Okay.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.640
Good boy. Yeah.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.839
- Good boy.
- Why are you waiting out here?

09:28.839 --> 09:31.839
I said to meet in the office.
We were supposed to start ten minutes ago.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.480
- Didn't know whether to go inside or not.
- You coming?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.400
Yeah.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.480
I'm assuming you ride?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.480
Yep. I, uh... I ride bikes.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.520
Horses.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.079
Thought I'd be looking after dogs.

09:47.079 --> 09:49.520
It said on the application
there was kennels.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.640
No. No, you'll mainly be teaching children
how to ride horses.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.480
You do ride?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.640
Absolutely.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.800
Love horse riding.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.079
And you, uh, drive?

10:00.079 --> 10:03.240
I am a great driver.
I just... I don't have a car, though.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.120
- Get the horse!
- Okay. Can you muck out Midnight for me?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.440
And then you can hose down
the rest of the stables.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.000
Mmm.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.120
Would anyone like some digestives?

10:26.120 --> 10:29.000
- I'm allergic to sugar.
- Are they dairy free?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.959
Ruby. Digestive?

10:35.959 --> 10:37.839
I've had an idea that could help you.

10:37.839 --> 10:39.720
And why would you want to help me?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.640
Because, Otis, I want us to be friends.

10:47.199 --> 10:50.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't even keep a straight face.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.640
No, this is purely political. Move.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.880
Abbi and Roman are fighting.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.800
Okay, so?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.800
Every school has kingmakers, Otis,
and at this college, it's them.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.480
You fix their relationship,

11:05.480 --> 11:07.959
everyone ditches O
and comes to you instead.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.880
What's in it for you?

11:11.560 --> 11:15.959
Put in a good word for me with Abbi,
so that she'll want to hang out with me.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.440
I don't want to play games, Ruby.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.000
I think if I just be myself,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.640
people will eventually realize
I am the better therapist.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.880
Okay. Good luck with that, Otis.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.560
Hey.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.719
Hey. Hey, uh... I just finished
this great statistics book.

11:42.719 --> 11:45.040
Thought you might like it.
Shall I send it to you?

11:45.560 --> 11:46.880
- Yeah.
- Uh...

11:47.839 --> 11:49.160
Done.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.120
Got it.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.719
Do you wanna study with me this weekend?

11:55.360 --> 11:56.839
I have to focus.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.880
Oh God. No, no.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.079
Did you... did you think I meant,
like, a date or something? Um...

12:02.719 --> 12:03.640
I ju...

12:03.640 --> 12:06.360
- I didn't, 'cause that would be a leap.
- Right. Yeah.

12:07.199 --> 12:11.240
I honestly did mean for us to just study,
but, um, I completely get that you can't.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.800
So, yeah, hope you enjoy the book.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.320
Thanks.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.280
Jesus. Oh no. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

- Okay, thanks.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.760
- Okay, let's go.
- Do this.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.520
- Never seen you in here before.
- I'm just... trying to stay fit.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.199
Has anyone ever put their finger
up your bum before?

13:08.199 --> 13:09.920
Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.959
Thought you were
still doing that therapy thing.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.880
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
I don't like you.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.599
- I'm having casual sex with this girl.
- Mmm?

13:18.599 --> 13:21.839
And last time we did it,
dude, she put her finger

13:22.920 --> 13:24.079
up my bum.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.920
- Okay.
- I'm talking, like... like <i>way</i> up there.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.199
With no warnin'.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.839
Like a ninja.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.120
And now I'm feeling totally freaked out.

13:36.839 --> 13:39.760
Did this act feel bad for you?

13:39.760 --> 13:40.920
No, it felt great.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.959
I mean, it was a shock.

13:45.839 --> 13:47.839
But... I came.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.560
Really fast.
And now I'm feeling very confused.

13:52.079 --> 13:54.240
Because I really didn't think I was queer.

13:54.240 --> 13:58.000
But maybe, if I like this kind of thing,
then I'm...

13:59.120 --> 14:00.520
queerer than I thought.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.440
Well, sexuality can be very fluid.
And it's normal to have questions.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.719
Plus, there's a lot of heterosexual men

14:06.719 --> 14:09.280
who also like
having their prostate stimulated.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.560
- You boys using this bench?
- No.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.920
You all right? You seem disappointed?

14:16.920 --> 14:19.680
I really like this person
who it didn't work out with.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.959
And I thought,
maybe if I was, like, a little bit queer,

14:23.959 --> 14:25.800
then I could get them back.

14:29.319 --> 14:32.760
- We had a real connection.
- You don't feel that with this new person?

14:32.760 --> 14:36.199
I mean, she's nice,
but there's not much conversation.

14:36.199 --> 14:38.079
Even though you enjoyed yourself,

14:38.079 --> 14:40.360
those things should
never come as a surprise.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.719
I would encourage you guys
to practice enthusiastic consent,

14:43.719 --> 14:46.360
which is looking
for the presence of a happy yes,

14:46.360 --> 14:49.000
rather than the absence of an unhappy no.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.280
You might find better communication
leads to a more intimate connection.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.880
But being hung up on someone
you still have feelings for is hard.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.920
What is it you think
you miss the most about them?

15:01.760 --> 15:05.439
So my brain is often anxious.
It's been like that since I can remember.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.520
But when we were together, they kind of

15:09.240 --> 15:10.959
made things go quiet for a second.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.959
But I have this habit of
falling for people that can't commit, so...

15:16.800 --> 15:17.719
Mmm.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.319
- Talking about Maeve?
- Yes.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.479
It always felt like
she was lookin' for something better.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.120
It's a shame about the whole college
seeing your weird pubes thing.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.240
- 'Cause you're good at this.
- Thanks, man.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.599
Though the lead character was so unsavory,
I didn't wanna leave him.

15:44.599 --> 15:47.000
- I was haunted by his journey.
- I agree.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
The way you write about feeling isolated
within your own community, it's, uh...

15:51.000 --> 15:52.079
it's fascinating.

15:52.079 --> 15:53.800
Brutal but eye-opening.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.199
It's a little overwritten, but it's
a promising start. Thank you, Tyrone.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.199
Who's next? Maeve?

16:02.839 --> 16:05.800
Talk to me about what you were aiming for
with this first chapter.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.400
So I was aiming to explore Maria Brontë's
isolation through her illness.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.800
- Um, she's the protagonist, so--
- Yeah, I--

16:12.800 --> 16:14.839
I was bored.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.520
- Oh.
- I do not think this has a pulse.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.560
Okay.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.199
What does everyone else think?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.199
You can be honest.
We're here to help each other.

16:25.199 --> 16:27.800
I liked that it was written
from Maria's perspective.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.400
I saw the world through her eyes.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.800
I didn't know anything
about the oldest Brontë sister.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.560
Well, that's what Wikipedia's for.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.400
There are lots of historical novels.

16:37.479 --> 16:38.479
It's uh...

16:40.400 --> 16:43.920
Okay, not trying to be mean here.
I'm just trying to push you.

16:43.920 --> 16:49.120
You're clearly very well-read,
but this, it... it feels like imitation.

16:50.479 --> 16:53.800
I wanna know who <i>you</i> are.
I wanna hear <i>your</i> voice.

16:55.079 --> 16:58.000
Okay? All right.
We will continue this next class.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.760
- We heard you and Roman are fighting.
- We're sending positive thoughts.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.159
Um, thank you.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.240
If people focused on their own problems
instead of other people's,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.040
the world would be a better place.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.720
I'm gonna get a drink.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.480
This is huge.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.280
Abbi and Roman never fight.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.760
- I want to know what happened so badly.
- What...

17:42.760 --> 17:44.640
So, what? She hasn't told you?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.520
She says it's betraying Roman.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.120
- Which I think is ridiculous.
- Sh, she's coming.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.000
- Please don't tell Abbi I gossiped.
- No, no, no.

17:53.919 --> 17:56.680
- I really hope you can work this out.
- Thanks. I do too.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.000
I booked us in with O,
so hopefully, it'll be fine.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.240
- Can I still crash at yours tonight?
- Sure, any time.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.600
You should come over
to Aisha's later and hang out.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.880
Oh, I'd love to, but I, um...
I've got, like, a family thing.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.360
- That's cool, next time.
- Yeah.

18:16.399 --> 18:20.440
I don't want to go there just yet.
But did you guys just hear a fart?

18:20.440 --> 18:22.919
- No!
- Did someone fart?

18:22.919 --> 18:24.520
- Wasn't me!
- No!

18:24.520 --> 18:26.560
You don't need to. You don't need to.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
Hello, hello, hello.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.679
- Hey! Hello, hello. Hi.
- Um...

18:34.679 --> 18:37.399
- I was wondering if you'd do me a favor.
- Mmm?

18:37.399 --> 18:40.200
- So, you know Roman and Abbi are fighting?
- Yes.

18:40.200 --> 18:45.399
I was wondering if you could
put in a good word for me and my clinic?

18:45.399 --> 18:50.080
Ooh. I don't really know if I wanna
play around in their relationship.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.320
- Okay.
- Know what I mean?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.760
Yeah. No, that's fine. I get it. I was...

18:53.760 --> 18:57.120
- It was probably a silly idea. Sorry.
- No, no. No, I'm sorry.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.800
- Uh...
- It's fine.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.919
- Mmm.
- It's fine, honestly.

19:01.919 --> 19:04.840
Um... I've gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for church.

19:04.840 --> 19:09.200
- But I will see you tomorrow. Yeah.
- See you tomorrow, yeah.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.720
- See you later.
- See you later.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.360
Okay, we're good to go.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.919
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

19:24.560 --> 19:26.159

Oh, I've just said that.

19:45.600 --> 19:50.640

Your sex and relationship problems.

Your mother mentioned you were havin'
some doubts about gettin' baptized?

20:56.240 --> 20:59.919
Oh, she did? Excellent. Thanks, Mum.

20:59.919 --> 21:02.120
Sometimes it helps
to talk these things through.

21:04.399 --> 21:07.399
- I just don't feel fully accepted here.
- In what sense?

21:07.399 --> 21:10.440
You're a really important member
of our community, Eric.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.600
I have to hide parts of myself
that others might not be comfortable with.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.520
I see.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.399
But your relationship with God
is personal.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.800
Other people don't need to know. Do they?

21:23.800 --> 21:25.040
But it's who I am.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.080
Baptism is between you and God.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.360
So don't let anything hold you back.

21:32.159 --> 21:33.000

21:47.080 --> 21:49.880
Oh my God! I'm just on my way to Aisha's.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.120
- You have to try this. It's so good.
- What is it?

21:53.120 --> 21:55.240
It's like a hemp strawberry milkshake.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.720
- Mmm!
- Get into it!

21:59.720 --> 22:01.600
Oh my God! That is <i>so</i> good!

22:02.520 --> 22:05.159
- How was your family thing?
- Uh...

22:05.159 --> 22:10.120
Do you know what? I actually...
was at this baptism class at my church.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.560
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.840
People can be a bit funny
about the whole God thing, so...

22:15.399 --> 22:16.720
I lied.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.919
- Wanna walk with me for a bit?
- Yeah.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.720
I'm Christian, too, by the way.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.080
- You are not?
- Yes.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.480
Oh my gosh, Abbi!

22:34.480 --> 22:37.840
Yeah, I had to leave my old church
when I started my transition,

22:37.840 --> 22:39.720
but it was tough.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.960
But I still believe in God.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.120
I'm trying to get Roman to come with me
to a more accepting church,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.679
but he's so anti-religious.

22:47.679 --> 22:50.399
- Oh.
- So I get the whole, um, judgment thing.

22:50.399 --> 22:51.800
- Trust me.
- Yes.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.439
Is your church more open or...

22:55.439 --> 22:57.360
Uh, no.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.520
So I'm finding it tough too.

23:02.919 --> 23:04.919
You can talk to me about it
if you ever need.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.120
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Come here.

23:08.439 --> 23:10.439
Aww. Thank you, Abbi.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.480
Aah.

23:20.439 --> 23:22.200
Here we go.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.000
Ooh.

23:25.679 --> 23:27.000
Looks lovely, Michael.

23:30.919 --> 23:34.159
Adam started his apprenticeship today
at the farm.

23:34.159 --> 23:39.200
Um, I actually need to learn how to drive.
I... I didn't realize when I applied.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.560
Oh, okay. We can get you some lessons.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.600
- What are the career prospects...
- Thank you.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
...after this apprenticeship?

23:46.600 --> 23:50.280
Um... I'm learning to teach kids
how to ride horses.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.679
Oh. So, you want
to be a riding instructor?

23:54.679 --> 23:56.880
Or you want to run a farm?

23:56.880 --> 23:58.000
Thank you.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.159
I just like animals.

24:00.159 --> 24:03.919
Well, you can't make a career
just because you like something.

24:03.919 --> 24:06.240
You're gonna have to earn money
in the real world.

24:06.919 --> 24:09.640
Maybe something like bricklaying

24:10.760 --> 24:12.439
would be a better option.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.880
- Would you like some kale?
- I'm actually not hungry.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.280
What did I do?
He clearly hasn't thought about it.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.439
I don't want it to be another thing
he doesn't see through.

24:35.919 --> 24:36.840
Kale?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.040
No, I don't want any kale.

24:41.399 --> 24:43.080
Maybe he doesn't see anything through

24:43.080 --> 24:46.360
because he's so afraid of
disappointing you that he doesn't try.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.280
Oh.

24:51.439 --> 24:53.399
Adam, I'm heading off now.

24:53.399 --> 24:54.480
Yeah.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.600
If you'd like, I could, um...

25:04.919 --> 25:07.280
give you a driving lesson at the weekend.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.040
I'm, um... sorry.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.919
I was too harsh downstairs.

25:18.199 --> 25:20.720
I just want you
to think about your future. That's all.

25:27.199 --> 25:28.800
- Okay.
- Hmm?

25:31.360 --> 25:33.760
I'll, um...
I'll think about the driving lesson.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.679
Why is the furniture all changed around?

25:57.679 --> 26:01.280
Uh, Joanna did it. She's unpacking.
We heard your radio show.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.919
- It was...
- Disastrous.

26:03.919 --> 26:08.080
I was distracted,
because my sister,

26:08.080 --> 26:10.159
who was looking after my newborn,

26:10.159 --> 26:12.199
wasn't answering the phone.

26:12.199 --> 26:13.280
Hmm.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.679
I can't believe
that you asked her here, Otis.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.040
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking you needed some help.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.000
Well, I don't. I'm fine. It's...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.640
No, you're not fine, Mum.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.320
Jakob and Ola are gone, you have a baby,
and I'm in my last year of sixth form.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.720
A lot's changed. You need some support.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.360
- I wish you hadn't asked <i>her.</i>
- Well, I did.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.840
And she's here now,
so please just let her help you.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.159
Not great. Mr. Molloy hated my chapter.

27:23.159 --> 27:24.720
Okay, well, I'm sure he's wrong.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.520
Well, he's probably right.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.480
Tyrone liked it, but I need to write
something more personal. How was your day?

27:30.480 --> 27:34.199
- Tyrone seems to be around a lot.
- Yeah. He's my friend.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.280
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

27:36.960 --> 27:40.199
Just that you...
you speak about him a lot, and...

27:40.199 --> 27:43.040
<i>- He's there a lot.
- </i>  Did you call to check up on Tyrone?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.560
No, I'm...

27:46.159 --> 27:48.840
- I don't have a good feeling about him.
- You don't know him.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.840
<i>I know you keep dropping him
into conversation.</i>

27:50.840 --> 27:54.439
- And he's putting photos of you online.
- <i>You've been stalking him online?</i>

27:54.439 --> 27:57.000
I casually checked, Maeve.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.120
Otis. He's gay.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.679
<i>He has a boyfriend back home in Illinois.</i>

28:08.199 --> 28:09.040
Okay.

28:09.040 --> 28:12.080
<i>That clears that up, then. I'm glad.</i>

28:12.840 --> 28:15.080
Okay. I feel really bad now.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.760
- Can we pretend I didn't say anything?
- No. You've pissed me off.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.399
- I've got to get back to work. Bye.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.840

28:50.080 --> 28:51.600

29:38.919 --> 29:40.120
Hey, do you wanna stay?

29:41.439 --> 29:44.280
We could get to know each other a bit.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.159
I meant it when I said
I want this to be casual.

29:51.159 --> 29:52.080
Yeah.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.399
I'm not doing relationships right now.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.080
It's probably nothing,
but I felt something in your ball.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.240
I think you might have a lump.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.280
You might wanna get it checked out.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.320
Huh?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.560
What the fuck?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.120
So, wait, Tyrone is gay?

30:34.199 --> 30:36.959
I... should have known.

30:36.959 --> 30:39.439
And then you accused Maeve of cheatin'?

30:42.199 --> 30:43.159
Shut up.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.959
- It's not funny.
- That is so fun... No.

30:47.959 --> 30:50.439
No, you're quite right.
It's not funny at all.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.840
Except it's very funny!

30:59.320 --> 31:01.639
Would you like to light a candle
for Abbi and Roman?

31:01.639 --> 31:02.959
Oh gosh.

31:02.959 --> 31:04.399
They have to stay together.

31:04.399 --> 31:07.320
They have an appointment with O
later today to talk things through.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.760
- O.
- We're sending positive thoughts.

31:19.679 --> 31:22.000
- Do you need a spot?
- Thanks, yeah. That'd be great.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.399
- Of course.
- I'm tense today.

31:26.439 --> 31:27.959
What's goin' on for you?

31:29.240 --> 31:33.240
I don't know if you saw my speech. I'm a...
I'm a therapist. Maybe I can help.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.840
Oh yeah. You're Patchy Pubes Guy.

31:35.840 --> 31:36.959
Uh, yeah.

31:36.959 --> 31:41.120
I had a fight with me girlfriend.
It's bad. I feel so betrayed.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.320
What happened?

31:44.760 --> 31:47.919
<i>It was two nights ago.
I asked Abbi if she wanted to have sex.</i>

31:47.919 --> 31:50.800
<i>She said she wasn't in the mood,
so we had a kiss good night,</i>

31:50.800 --> 31:53.719
<i>had a cuddle,
and I thought we both went to sleep.</i>

31:54.760 --> 31:55.679
But then...

32:00.040 --> 32:02.800
<i>I woke up to this strange sound and...</i>

32:04.639 --> 32:07.919
Abbi, are you... wankin'?

32:10.520 --> 32:13.280
It's interesting to me
you use the word "betrayed."

32:13.280 --> 32:16.080
- Can you tell me more?
- It feels like she was cheatin'.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.840
Well, engaging in self-pleasure
in a committed relationship

32:21.840 --> 32:25.199
can be beneficial to a healthy sex life.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.240
We don't really have sex anymore.

32:32.679 --> 32:35.240
And how long's that been the case?

32:36.199 --> 32:38.320
Since she moved in with me and me family.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.520
I feel like she's not
attracted to me anymore.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.679
Has she told you that?

32:41.679 --> 32:44.800
Well, no, but Abbi doesn't like
to talk about negative things.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.480
So even if she wasn't
attracted to me anymore,

32:47.480 --> 32:49.280
I feel like she wouldn't tell me.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.679
She says she has a low sex drive,
but then she's secretly wankin'.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.280
Sex drives are a complicated thing,
and lots of things can affect it.

32:57.280 --> 33:02.280
There is stress or tiredness,
over-familiarity, expectation.

33:03.919 --> 33:05.120
It's been a tough time.

33:06.959 --> 33:11.000
Abbi's family kicked her out,
and she pretends she's okay, but...

33:11.719 --> 33:14.959
sometimes I don't think she is.

33:14.959 --> 33:16.000
Hmm.

33:17.679 --> 33:20.000
Sometimes couples need
to take the pressure off

33:20.000 --> 33:21.639
and just go back to the basics.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.040
Hugging, kissing,
just spending time with each other

33:26.040 --> 33:27.959
without the underlying pressures of sex.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.280
I do love huggin' Abbi.

33:32.159 --> 33:36.439
I mean, it seems to me that
you don't really want to break up at all.

33:38.719 --> 33:43.639
Do you think Abbi might be interested
in having a session with you and me?

33:46.399 --> 33:47.399
Thank you.

Oh, it doesn't look right.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.400
- What's it meant to look like?
- Supposed to be my melon.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.960
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.200
I had this friend called Melon
when I was a kid.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.560
- Great work. Ooh!
- Took him everywhere with me.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.160
But it doesn't look anything like him,
so the picture doesn't mean anything.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.600
- Oh, great.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.560

the edges.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.680
Sorry, why did you
call your childhood teddy bear Melon?

35:22.680 --> 35:25.600
No, no, he wasn't a teddy bear.
He was an actual melon.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.560
Yeah, I loved him so much,

35:27.560 --> 35:30.680
but he went all moldy and shrunk,
and he smelled so bad.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.720
It was my first experience of death.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.040
Aimee, that's really weird.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.400
- Is it?
- Yeah.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.880
Lovely, but just quite weird.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.520
Nice and light.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.760
- Do you like drawing?
- Be bold.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.960
Uh, it hurts my wrist,
having to hold a pencil for so long.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.400
Then you don't have to draw.

35:46.400 --> 35:51.200
There's loads of ways to make art.
I can show you this weekend if you like.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.880
- That's interesting.
- Yeah.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.360
- Thank you.
- Cool.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.120
Her knees are a triumph.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.799
Great job. The color's very vivid.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.520
See that thing on her jacket?
It's a microphone.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.560
And yet, she still shouts.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.680
Very good instincts.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.200
Hi. I'm Cal, by the way.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.799
Aisha, nice to meet you.

36:20.319 --> 36:22.720
Oh, stop whining.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.720
I don't know what you want.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.000
Afternoon.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.280
Where's the coffee?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.080
Why are you here, Jo?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.240
To help you. I told you.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.080
And, um... I broke up with Patrick,

36:43.080 --> 36:46.120
so I'm... sort of in between places.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.960
- When?
- A few months ago.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.760
He was lovely, but it started to feel like
I was having sex with my brother.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.280
He started pissing
with the door open all the time.

36:54.280 --> 36:58.160
I got back from Malaysia and haven't
had a chance to find anywhere to live yet.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.600
And you need my help,
and I need somewhere to stay,

37:00.600 --> 37:02.080
so it was meant to be.

37:02.080 --> 37:06.280
Well, if you're going to be here, Jo,
then properly be here.

37:06.880 --> 37:07.799
Okay.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.200
- I'm here.
- Then, here.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.200
- I will make the coffee.
- Okay.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.640
Come in.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.600
Otis.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.000
- I wanted to talk about something else.
- Of course.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.440
Um, so I took your advice,
and it was great.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.359
Cool.

37:36.359 --> 37:38.520
But then the girl
who I was telling you about,

37:38.520 --> 37:41.040
she told me about a lump that I've got.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.120
On my ball.

37:43.280 --> 37:47.359
- Which is normal for some guys, right?
- Um, some people, it's perfectly normal.

37:48.120 --> 37:51.359
But if it's a new lump,
or you're just worried about it,

37:51.880 --> 37:53.480
you should go and see a doctor.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.359
- Okay, thanks.
- All good.

37:55.359 --> 37:59.040
Oh, also, that thing I said
about Maeve yesterday.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.640
Chattin' shit.
I genuinely think she likes you.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.920
I'm just feelin' lonely or something
at the moment, so...

38:07.080 --> 38:07.920
You all right?

38:07.920 --> 38:09.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:12.240 --> 38:13.200
Cool, thank you.

38:16.839 --> 38:17.680
Thanks.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.359
Hello.

38:22.359 --> 38:23.799
Can I help you?

38:23.799 --> 38:25.440
- That's cute.
- Mmm.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.600
I have been thinking about our clinics,
and maybe we should team up.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.319
- Really?
- You're obviously not awful at this.

38:31.319 --> 38:33.120
And I could use an assistant.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.280
Okay, well, I don't need to assist anyone.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.120
You know, I'm running my own clinic here.
I don't know if you've noticed?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.520
- But it's doing pretty good.
- You said it yourself.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.520
Having two clinics on campus
isn't really gonna work,

38:46.520 --> 38:48.000
and I'm not goin' anywhere.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.400
- So I'm just tryin' to find a solution.
- Hmm.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.560
I mean, this is a student-led campus.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.080
- Mmm.
- Why don't we let them decide?

38:56.080 --> 38:58.200
- What, like an election?
- Yeah.

38:59.799 --> 39:02.000
Are you... are you bein' serious?

39:02.880 --> 39:03.799
Very serious.

39:06.000 --> 39:06.920
Okay.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.160
Well, I will run it by Principal Lakhani.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.040
May the best sex therapist win.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.480
That would be me, by the way.

39:25.040 --> 39:25.920
Good work in here.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.960
Saddle up Midnight for me,
and you're done for the day.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.520
Are you afraid of horses?

39:56.640 --> 39:57.520
No.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.560
No, no, no. No, of course not.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.680
Their, uh...
their faces are a completely normal size.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.799
Okay, there we are.

40:11.799 --> 40:12.880
Okay.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.040
- It's on backwards.
- Right, okay.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.000
Maybe I don't know anything about horses.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.760
Maybe I'm a little bit scared of them.
Please don't fire me.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.359
I'm really good with dogs,
and, um, I'm a quick learner.

40:25.359 --> 40:27.680
They're just big dogs, right?

40:31.960 --> 40:35.040
- I really want this apprenticeship.
- For fuck's sake.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.319
You do drive, though?

40:40.319 --> 40:42.760
- No, you didn't!
- I had a good time/

40:43.560 --> 40:45.839
- Oh my God.
- The lion looked line...

40:45.839 --> 40:47.280
You seeing Anabelle tonight?

40:47.280 --> 40:48.400
Nah.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.480
I don't think I wanna do the casual thing.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.240
And I still like Cal, so...

40:56.839 --> 40:57.799
You all right?

40:59.160 --> 41:00.080
How's that?

41:00.080 --> 41:02.040
He asked me to study with him
at the weekend.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.839
Oh! So, you said yes?

41:05.839 --> 41:07.280
- No.
- What?

41:07.880 --> 41:09.680
- I can't get distracted.
- Viv!

41:09.680 --> 41:12.080
- You like him, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.760
And he clearly likes you back,
which doesn't happen often.

41:15.880 --> 41:16.839
Just go talk to him.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.040
Now.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.839
Hey, Viv.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.880
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.760
Um, I thought I told you
that I didn't want you messin' around

41:45.760 --> 41:47.359
in Abbi and Roman's relationship.

41:47.359 --> 41:50.040
I found a way to help them
without getting you involved.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.319
I thought that'd be okay.

41:51.319 --> 41:54.000
Yeah. Yeah, no, it is, I guess.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.520
Oooooooh!

42:01.240 --> 42:03.520
Tings are gettin' a little bit serious!

42:03.520 --> 42:05.760
- Hmm!
- Hey, Eric. Comin' to that vegan place?

42:05.760 --> 42:08.080
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Two seconds.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.799
- See you later.
- Bye.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.080
Ah, thanks again, Otis.
I'll maybe see you at the gym?

42:15.080 --> 42:16.200
Uh...

42:16.799 --> 42:21.160
No, I've... Gym's not for me. I think. Bye.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.160
- You'll love the falafel.
- Bye!

42:25.839 --> 42:28.720
- Yes! Oh my God.
- Oh my gosh! I can't wait!

42:28.720 --> 42:30.920
- Yeah, I...
- No! Really?

42:30.920 --> 42:33.280
How on Earth
did he become friends with them?

42:33.920 --> 42:36.240
- I don't know.
- So you took my advice.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.200
Okay, an opportunity presented itself.

42:39.200 --> 42:42.480
Stop talking.
Did you put in a good word for me?

42:43.880 --> 42:45.400
Okay, it's fine. Don't worry.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.240
I don't need your help anyway,
but you definitely need mine.

42:48.240 --> 42:51.400
- You have no idea what you're in for.
- What are you talkin' about?

42:51.400 --> 42:56.120
Well, I know how things like this work.
And I could be your campaign manager, hmm?

42:58.839 --> 43:01.240
Well, I'm with Maeve now,

43:01.240 --> 43:03.680
so I don't know
if that's really a good idea.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.520
Oh, I am not trying
to get back with you, Otis.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.200
You're very arrogant sometimes.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.839
- I know it's probably too on the nose.
- Maeve.

43:19.839 --> 43:21.240
It's fuckin' brilliant.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.200
And it pains me to say it
because I want that internship.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.560
Seriously, I feel like I've been
to where you grew up now.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.760
Like I know all these eccentric characters
in this place,

43:31.760 --> 43:33.560
but it's not sentimental at all.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.200
Like, there's no anger in it about
your mom or your dad not being there.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.839
- How did you write this in a day?
- It's what I know.

43:39.839 --> 43:41.400
You should give it to Molloy.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.359
He's gonna be all over it.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.120
Come in.

43:55.319 --> 43:56.280
Oh, sorry.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.480
No, it's okay. Come in.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.400
Come in. Come in!

44:02.480 --> 44:04.839
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:04.839 --> 44:07.720
I, uh... just got a rejection
from the <i>New Yorker.</i>

44:07.720 --> 44:11.359
You'd think at this point, I wouldn't care
what people think, but, uh...

44:12.160 --> 44:13.359
Fuck those assholes.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.680
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure it's their loss.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.120
Yeah, apparently,
everyone's writing about gay shit now, so...

44:20.480 --> 44:23.120
Okay. I... I can come back later.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.640
Maybe I could read it to you.

44:27.720 --> 44:31.359
"...not far from
that bright burning furnace."

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600
"Slow."

44:34.240 --> 44:35.720
"Slow, slow."

44:37.319 --> 44:40.000
"New shoots begin to root."

44:44.319 --> 44:45.359
It's great.

44:45.359 --> 44:47.280
It's... brilliant.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.120
Yeah, I...
I don't need you sucking up.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.720
It's what I liked about you
when you told me you'd read <i>Night Tales.</i>

44:53.720 --> 44:56.680
Nobody ever wants to talk about
my other work.

44:56.680 --> 45:00.160
They just want me
to keep rehashing <i>Rainbow Maze.</i>

45:01.200 --> 45:05.200
And a writer has to be allowed
to evolve, Maeve.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.799
So please, tell me what you think.

45:10.359 --> 45:12.000
The beginning really drew me in.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.960
- Mmm.
- Um...

45:12.960 --> 45:15.680
But the middle part lost me emotionally.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.920
You could make a few cuts.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.560
What I love about <i>Night Tales,</i>
for example, is that you... you...

45:25.480 --> 45:27.160
you just said it like it is.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.640
You didn't give a shit
about making the perfect sentence.

45:31.319 --> 45:34.640
You... you weren't so self-conscious
when you were starting out.

45:35.960 --> 45:36.960
It was all heart.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.480
- All heart.
- Mmm.

45:45.280 --> 45:48.200
It's an interesting observation.
Do you want me to read that?

45:48.200 --> 45:50.799
Oh yeah. Um... Sorry.

45:50.799 --> 45:54.839
This is, um...
It's an idea I had for a new book.

45:55.799 --> 45:57.640
There's... more of me in it, I think.

45:57.640 --> 45:58.720
What is Southchester?

45:58.720 --> 46:00.799
The name of the caravan park I grew up in.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.200
Great. I'll take a look.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.160
Yeah. Okay. Great, thanks.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.080
I'm sorry.

46:17.080 --> 46:21.680
I got carried away. And in my head,
you were... having an affair or something.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.760
<i>- It was stupid.
- </i>  It's okay.

46:23.760 --> 46:27.120
Distance is hard.
Just talk to me next time, okay?

46:27.120 --> 46:28.839
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

46:29.440 --> 46:31.000
You know my teacher, Mr. Molloy?

46:31.520 --> 46:34.120
He's looking for an intern.
I think I've got a chance of getting it.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.080
And staying in America?

46:37.080 --> 46:39.040
Yeah, I guess so, if I got the position.

46:39.839 --> 46:42.560
Right, right. Well, that's a big deal.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.200
- Why are you being weird?
- You said you were coming back.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.879
Well, I might have changed my mind.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.040
Okay, I've gotta go.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.960
What? For someone who's supposed
to be emotionally intelligent,

46:51.960 --> 46:54.280
you can be such an immature
arsehole sometimes.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.240
Yeah. Yeah. I'm the arsehole here.

46:56.240 --> 46:59.120
If we can't call without fighting
or one of us hanging up,

46:59.120 --> 47:00.359
we should take some space.

47:00.359 --> 47:02.359
Yeah. You know what? Good idea.

47:02.359 --> 47:04.440
Seriously? Fine.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.920
<i>All right, Cavendish. What's up?</i>
