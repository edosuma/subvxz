00:18.955 --> 00:20.822
What the hell?

00:21.896 --> 00:24.370
Man, they forgot my pico de gallo.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.963
Oh, love the shirt, Jake.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.299
Lilith Fair '98 had the best lineup.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.735
Meshell Ndegeocello
crushed it that year.

00:52.736 --> 00:54.270
Thank you, Boyle, but
this is not my shirt.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.438
I slept at Amy's and I spilled
ranch dressing on mine.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.706
Don't you have a drawer full of clothes

00:57.707 --> 00:59.074
at her place by this point?

00:59.075 --> 01:00.843
Yeah, I spilled ranch
dressing all over the drawer.

01:00.844 --> 01:02.645
What's so hard to understand
about this, guys?

01:02.646 --> 01:04.212
Why don't you two move
in together already?

01:04.214 --> 01:05.214
I thought you were planning to.

01:05.215 --> 01:07.249
We are. We just haven't decided

01:07.250 --> 01:08.817
whose apartment we're going to live in.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.419
I think Jake should move into mine,

01:10.420 --> 01:13.289
because it's bigger, nicer, and
isn't covered in black mold.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.391
Black mold, Amy? Not cool.

01:15.392 --> 01:17.726
- Right, Terry?
- What?

01:17.727 --> 01:19.962
I rest my case. Besides,
my place is cheaper

01:19.963 --> 01:21.363
and it's in a cooler neighborhood.

01:21.364 --> 01:24.533
Yeah. That neighborhood is
technically called Cobblestink.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.569
All right, everyone. Listen up.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.504
We have a situation. Ten minutes ago,

01:28.505 --> 01:30.573
a prison van overturned
on Nevins Street.

01:30.574 --> 01:33.509
It was carrying nine convicts
who are now at large.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.127
It's our job to bring them in.

01:35.731 --> 01:37.079
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:37.080 --> 01:38.280
this is a manhunt.

01:38.281 --> 01:40.182
A manhunt.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.118
Okay, what I want from
each and every one of you

01:43.119 --> 01:44.687
is a hard-target search

01:44.688 --> 01:47.523
of every gas station, residence,

01:47.524 --> 01:50.192
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,

01:50.193 --> 01:53.362
outhouse, and doghouse in the area.

01:53.363 --> 01:57.633
Your fugitive's name
is Dr. Richard Kimble.

01:57.634 --> 01:58.968
There must be some sort of error.

01:58.969 --> 02:00.135
There are nine fugitives,

02:00.136 --> 02:01.737
and none of them are named Kimble.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.606
- I didn't kill my wife!
- What?

02:03.607 --> 02:05.941
You're supposed to go, "I don't care!"

02:05.942 --> 02:08.110
- I don't care.
- Let the manhunt begin.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.679
Patrol officers have secured
a ten-block perimeter.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.381
All civilians are being evacuated.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.983
Here's what the convicts were in for:

02:13.984 --> 02:16.151
arson, kidnapping, racketeering,

02:16.152 --> 02:19.149
assault and battery, forgery
and counterfeiting,

02:19.150 --> 02:20.289
triple homicide.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.890
Whoo!

02:21.891 --> 02:23.392
What? I'm not excited about the murders.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.994
I'm excited about the
chance to avenge them.

02:24.995 --> 02:26.395
You guys are the weird ones.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.998
Diaz, I want you here with
me interviewing witnesses.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.599
The rest of you will
search the secured area

02:30.600 --> 02:32.501
in the following teams: Santiago, Boyle;

02:32.502 --> 02:33.502
Jeffords and Peralta.

02:33.503 --> 02:34.937
Get to work.

02:34.938 --> 02:37.473
Okay. We'll start south of Nevins.

02:37.474 --> 02:39.808
You two start at Bond and we'll
rendezvous in the middle,

02:39.809 --> 02:41.744
assuming, of course, Boyle
and I haven't already caught

02:41.745 --> 02:43.946
all the fugitives by the
time you two show up.

02:43.947 --> 02:45.681
Amy, there are nine hardened criminals

02:45.682 --> 02:46.915
running free in the streets.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.051
This is hardly the time
for childish trash talk.

02:49.052 --> 02:50.152
It's time for a bet.

02:50.153 --> 02:52.187
- A crazy-ass bet.
- What are you thinking?

02:52.188 --> 02:53.489
Whoever catches the most fugitives

02:53.490 --> 02:54.556
gets to keep their apartment.

02:54.557 --> 02:55.758
Loser moves in with the winner.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.359
All right. I'm in.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.962
I hope you like sleeping in a
bed with a thousand pillows.

02:59.963 --> 03:03.532
Well, I hope you like
sharing my one grey towel.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.700
Was it grey when you bought it?

03:04.701 --> 03:05.701
I didn't buy it.

03:05.702 --> 03:07.169
It was in the apartment when I moved in.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.637
Are you sure you don't want
to just move in with me?

03:08.638 --> 03:10.005
We already shook on it. The bet stands.

03:10.006 --> 03:11.740
Prepare to die, and by "die,"
I mean move in with me.

03:11.741 --> 03:12.908
Here we go.

03:12.909 --> 03:14.476
<i>I get that the streets are empty,</i>

03:14.477 --> 03:15.544
but slow down, man.

03:15.545 --> 03:16.545
Terry forgot his Dramamine.

03:16.546 --> 03:18.047
Stakes are high, Sarge.

03:18.048 --> 03:20.416
I know it doesn't matter to you,
but I really want to beat Amy.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.652
Doesn't matter? Look, I
am completely on board.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.187
You need your own space.

03:25.188 --> 03:27.189
I had a painting studio in my apartment.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.424
Was this in the '90s?

03:28.425 --> 03:29.858
Did you wear overalls and no shirt?

03:29.859 --> 03:32.294
Every chance I got.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.696
But then I moved in with Sharon.

03:33.697 --> 03:35.431
And then the kids came along.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.195
You know where I have to paint now?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.836
My acrylics!

03:40.837 --> 03:43.138
I am not gonna let you lose this bet.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.375
The march toward the closet
starts with a single step.

03:46.376 --> 03:48.310
Cool. So, basically just
telling me not to get married

03:48.311 --> 03:50.045
and have kids... Anything from dispatch?

03:50.046 --> 03:51.680
Security footage from a
bank near the accident.

03:51.681 --> 03:54.416
Two fugitives ran past going
north toward Flatbush.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.351
Looks like the arsonist
and the gun runner.

03:56.352 --> 03:57.820
Let's go after the arsonist first.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.488
I thought of the perfect thing
to say when we catch him

03:59.489 --> 04:01.090
that no one else could
ever have possibly...

04:01.091 --> 04:02.154
"You're burnt"?

04:04.678 --> 04:05.928
No.

04:05.929 --> 04:07.996
Initial reports had one of
the fugitives heading south

04:07.997 --> 04:09.331
on Lincoln Place.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.666
On it.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.968
So, I know you're Jake's
best friend, and...

04:12.969 --> 04:14.336
Did he say that? Did
you get that on tape?

04:14.337 --> 04:15.671
- No.
- No, he didn't say that

04:15.672 --> 04:17.072
or no, you didn't get it on tape?

04:17.091 --> 04:19.791
Doesn't matter. Either way,
you screwed up big time.

04:19.809 --> 04:22.644
Anyway, all I'm saying is I
know you're Jake's best friend

04:22.645 --> 04:24.046
and you really want him
to win this bet...

04:24.047 --> 04:26.482
Are you kidding? That's
the last thing I want.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.818
Jake moving in with you
is my dream come true.

04:29.819 --> 04:31.587
Your apartment is two
blocks away from mine.

04:31.588 --> 04:33.555
Jake will be able to pop by any time.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.858
Imagine it.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.360
He's had a tough day.
He's fighting with Amy.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.661
You know how you let things escalate.

04:39.662 --> 04:41.497
So, he just walks over to my place,

04:41.498 --> 04:42.965
bottle of wine in hand,

04:42.966 --> 04:44.266
and we just talk it out.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.634
And then by the time
that bottle's finished,

04:45.635 --> 04:48.771
you've come to your
senses and apologized.

04:48.772 --> 04:50.539
Maybe I don't want to win this bet.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.974
<i>Okay, we need to figure out</i>

04:51.975 --> 04:53.675
whether this crash was an accident

04:53.676 --> 04:55.611
or part of a deliberate escape plan.

04:55.612 --> 04:57.546
Gina, I need you manning the tip line.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.748
Ha-ha! Good luck talking to the crazies.

04:59.749 --> 05:00.749
Crazies?

05:00.750 --> 05:02.518
Oh, Rosa.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.453
Sad Rosa.

05:04.454 --> 05:07.723
Have some respect for
your fellow human beings.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.424
What has gotten into you?

05:09.425 --> 05:11.059
Solange just posted a video

05:11.060 --> 05:13.962
of a Kenyan human rights
activist, Abdala,

05:13.963 --> 05:17.432
and I realized he and I
are the only two people

05:17.433 --> 05:19.568
that can save the world.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.052
I'm so excited.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.308
Okay, Diaz, there are only two witnesses

05:26.309 --> 05:28.477
who were close enough to the
crash to see something.

05:28.478 --> 05:29.545
One's on his way here already.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.680
His name is Marshawn Lynch.

05:31.681 --> 05:33.048
Marshawn Lynch?

05:33.049 --> 05:34.650
Marshawn Lynch the football player?

05:34.651 --> 05:36.518
I don't know his hobbies.
It just says here

05:36.519 --> 05:37.653
he's unemployed.

05:37.654 --> 05:38.921
Retired.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.722
We're not getting anything out of him.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.758
He's always getting fined for
refusing to talk to the press.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.893
Ugh, he's kind of one of my heroes.

05:44.894 --> 05:46.895
Well, it may be tough,
and it may take a while,

05:46.896 --> 05:48.931
but I'm sure we'll get him to open up.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.466
Sir, there are some vaults
you just can't open.

05:51.467 --> 05:52.760
I ain't seen anything.

05:54.304 --> 05:56.104
I was eating my quesadilla.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.841
It was a good one.
Chicken, cheese, guac.

05:58.842 --> 06:00.776
But they forgot my pico de gallo.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.211
I remember when I was a little boy,

06:02.212 --> 06:03.679
my mama used to make this, uh,

06:03.680 --> 06:05.414
she used to call it "fo' cheese."

06:05.415 --> 06:07.249
What y'all call it?
Y'all call it "four"?

06:07.250 --> 06:09.585
How come they never make
quesadillas with sausage?

06:09.586 --> 06:11.787
You throw some tomato sauce in there

06:11.788 --> 06:13.622
and call it a pizza-dilla...
What you think?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.057
What is going on?

06:15.058 --> 06:17.192
This one time, I tried
to wait up all night

06:17.193 --> 06:18.694
to catch Santa Claus, right?

06:18.695 --> 06:19.928
You know how they tell you

06:19.929 --> 06:21.363
you got to put the cookies
and the milk out?

06:21.364 --> 06:22.798
I don't really be telling nobody this,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.700
but I like to sleep with the fan on,

06:24.701 --> 06:26.335
even when it's chilly outside.

06:26.336 --> 06:27.636
All about that white noise, baby.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.305
Stop. Stop talking, Marshawn Lynch.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.708
Did you see anything
after the van crashed?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.476
Yes or no?

06:34.477 --> 06:37.012
Nope. Like I told you, I was
just eating my quesadilla.

06:37.013 --> 06:39.214
Have I talked to y'all about
my pizza-dilla invention?

06:39.215 --> 06:42.918
Yes, well, I have other
matters to attend to.

06:42.919 --> 06:46.688
So, Detective Diaz, just
take down everything

06:46.689 --> 06:48.323
Mr. Lynch has to say.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.741
Captain...

06:51.111 --> 06:53.896
You think he'll let me shoot his gun?

06:53.897 --> 06:55.464
Jake, look.

06:55.465 --> 06:56.565
You think it's our guys?

06:56.566 --> 06:58.133
Maybe. But this is New York,

06:58.134 --> 07:00.619
so there's a very strong
chance it's just "city blood."

07:04.391 --> 07:06.391
- NYPD! Freeze!
- Freeze!

07:08.395 --> 07:11.880
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the precinct

07:11.881 --> 07:15.255
escaped convict number one!

07:16.052 --> 07:17.319
Terry, where's the music?
That was the cue.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.154
I didn't have that Queen
song on my phone.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.189
I wasn't gonna pay $1.99 for it.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.858
Nice work, man. You can
put your perp in holding

07:22.859 --> 07:24.059
with the other three convicts.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.294
- Wait. Other three?
- Yeah.

07:25.295 --> 07:26.728
Santiago and Boyle brought them in.

07:26.729 --> 07:28.730
That's right. It's three to one.

07:28.731 --> 07:30.465
Guess you won't be needing this anymore

07:30.466 --> 07:32.134
since you'll be moving in with me.

07:32.135 --> 07:33.718
- My towel.
- Yeah, your towel.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.641
Why won't it burn?

07:39.642 --> 07:41.343
Because it never fully dries.

07:41.344 --> 07:43.495
The towel lives, and so do we!

07:45.209 --> 07:46.962
Hey, Santiago, how did you guys

07:46.964 --> 07:48.098
catch three perps so quickly?

07:48.099 --> 07:49.483
They weren't even close to each other.

07:49.507 --> 07:51.441
Given the magnitude of the situation,

07:51.442 --> 07:54.577
we were given full access to any
and all department resources.

07:54.578 --> 07:57.313
That's right. We took a little trip

07:57.314 --> 08:00.049
down to the tactical supply armory.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.317
No, you did not!

08:01.318 --> 08:03.219
Thermal imaging, baby.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.554
Thermal imaging baby?

08:04.555 --> 08:06.289
Very handy in fugitive hunting.

08:06.290 --> 08:07.857
Also...

08:07.858 --> 08:10.660
I got this Flo-Tech performance polo

08:10.661 --> 08:12.629
with moisture-wicking technology.

08:12.630 --> 08:13.763
Kept me dry all morning.

08:13.764 --> 08:16.933
And a dry is a smart boy.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.735
Ugh, he keeps saying that.

08:18.736 --> 08:20.236
Charles, you've gotten
negative reactions

08:20.237 --> 08:21.604
from everyone who's heard it.

08:21.605 --> 08:22.739
I needed to see what Jake thought.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.474
- Oh, I hated it.
- Really?

08:24.475 --> 08:27.782
Anyway, gentlemen, we are off
to catch some more convicts.

08:27.784 --> 08:29.584
Two more, and we win.

08:29.586 --> 08:30.464
Huh, just two?

08:30.466 --> 08:31.978
No sweat.

08:31.979 --> 08:32.849
Literally.

08:32.850 --> 08:35.217
Get out of here. Take those
glass cutters with you.

08:35.219 --> 08:37.886
Oh, these lil' ol' things?

08:37.888 --> 08:39.022
- Tsst.
- What?

08:39.023 --> 08:40.990
Why'd you put your finger in the middle?

08:40.991 --> 08:43.058
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. I was
wondering if you could

08:43.059 --> 08:44.494
answer some questions
about the car accident

08:44.495 --> 08:45.595
you witnessed this morning.

08:48.766 --> 08:50.066
- What's she trying to tell us?
- I don't know.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.467
Probably "Never meet your heroes",

08:51.468 --> 08:52.869
'cause they're gonna turn
out to be friendly."

08:52.870 --> 08:53.970
You need to get over this

08:53.971 --> 08:55.905
Marshawn Lynch situation real quick.

08:55.906 --> 08:57.240
Now, we just have to figure out

08:57.241 --> 08:58.975
what language she's speaking
so we can find a translator.

08:58.976 --> 09:00.610
Here, ma'am.

09:00.611 --> 09:03.446
Take a look at this map of the world.

09:03.447 --> 09:05.548
You just keep one of those on you?

09:05.549 --> 09:07.483
Of course. In case I ever
need to prove my point

09:07.484 --> 09:08.484
in an argument.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.720
- Laos.
- Fine!

09:10.721 --> 09:12.722
Oh, it was better than fine.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.190
It was Laos.

09:14.191 --> 09:16.526
- Mm.
- So, where are you from?

09:16.527 --> 09:18.795
Where did you grow up?

09:18.796 --> 09:23.399
Where were you born?

09:23.400 --> 09:24.434
What are you miming there, sir?

09:24.435 --> 09:25.902
A child tying his tie.

09:25.903 --> 09:28.538
Uh-huh. I'm trying to do
a simple Half Windsor

09:28.539 --> 09:30.139
so she knows I'm a baby.

09:30.140 --> 09:33.910
Look at this. See how
basic this knot is?

09:33.911 --> 09:36.379
I love these thermal goggles.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.381
Amy, listen to me very carefully.

09:38.382 --> 09:40.016
If you and Jake are thinking of trying,

09:40.017 --> 09:41.751
you are ovulating like crazy right now.

09:41.752 --> 09:44.153
You take that helmet off
before I knock it off.

09:44.154 --> 09:46.456
What? Your basal temperature
is off the charts.

09:46.457 --> 09:47.657
This is a good thing.

09:47.658 --> 09:48.808
Boyle!

09:52.046 --> 09:53.763
NYPD! Get down!

09:53.764 --> 09:55.114
Freeze!

09:56.684 --> 09:59.535
Aah! The room's hot. I'm blowing out.

09:59.536 --> 10:00.953
This way. Come on.

10:03.324 --> 10:06.042
Oh, come on! Where did
you guys even come from?

10:06.043 --> 10:08.344
Your nightmares.

10:08.345 --> 10:11.347
Hey, Amy, allow me to
introduce you to Big Bertha.

10:11.348 --> 10:14.384
Okay, I guess I'm not worth
introducing to your truck.

10:14.385 --> 10:18.288
That's right, y'all. We
went to Homeland Security.

10:18.289 --> 10:21.057
Yep, this beauty comes fully
equipped with thermal imaging,

10:21.058 --> 10:23.092
a satellite link-up, and she plugs in

10:23.093 --> 10:24.794
to every surveillance
camera in the city.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.596
And she's also got a holding cell,

10:26.597 --> 10:28.298
which is big enough for three perps.

10:28.299 --> 10:30.934
Jake, counting this guy, how
many perps have we caught

10:30.935 --> 10:32.602
and placed in the three-perp perp cell?

10:32.603 --> 10:34.003
Well, Sarge, we've placed three perps

10:34.004 --> 10:35.138
in the three-perp perp cell.

10:35.139 --> 10:36.606
So, the three-perp perp cell's full?

10:36.607 --> 10:38.007
Full of three perps is the
three-perp perp cell.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.009
Okay, stop saying "perps"
and "cell" and "three."

10:40.010 --> 10:41.778
You sound irritated.
What's the score now?

10:41.779 --> 10:44.380
Are you guys still ahead?
Let me just check.

10:44.381 --> 10:46.316
Oh, drone! Little help?

10:48.319 --> 10:51.387
Yeah, I can't read that
score. What does it say?

10:51.388 --> 10:53.756
Anyway, I'm sure you're
tracking whatever the score is.

10:53.757 --> 10:55.508
All right, thank you,
drone. That'll be all.

10:57.779 --> 10:59.362
Whoop! Didn't see the tree there.

10:59.363 --> 11:01.914
Big Bertha has a drone.
That's what's important.

11:04.585 --> 11:06.369
What are you trying to tell us?

11:06.370 --> 11:07.937
Is this some kind of a clue?

11:09.340 --> 11:11.574
Draw better. We have
no idea what this is.

11:11.575 --> 11:13.977
- I think it's a cookie.
- No. It's a pizza.

11:13.978 --> 11:16.579
It's a cookie pizza!

11:16.580 --> 11:18.381
Another case solved.

11:18.382 --> 11:19.916
No. Detectives, we...

11:19.917 --> 11:21.968
Shh shh shh. Let them go.

11:23.438 --> 11:26.489
She's taking us somewhere.
This is good. This is good.

11:26.490 --> 11:28.157
We're gonna crack this, Diaz.

11:30.361 --> 11:33.529
Nope. She just needed to take a dump.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.298
<i>Okay, satellite images showed</i>

11:35.299 --> 11:37.233
one of the two remaining
convicts entered this building.

11:37.234 --> 11:39.535
If we catch him, that's
five. I win the bet.

11:39.536 --> 11:41.170
Amy moves in with me.
I lord it over her.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.572
She's miserable. We live
happily ever after.

11:42.573 --> 11:43.773
It's fool-proof.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.341
There's got to be 30
floors in this building.

11:45.342 --> 11:47.010
It'll take forever to
sweep the whole place.

11:47.011 --> 11:48.478
Nuh-uh. We can use Big Bertha

11:48.479 --> 11:49.979
to tap into the security cameras.

11:52.716 --> 11:55.351
Ohh.

11:55.352 --> 11:58.388
Okay. This room is clear,
but check that closet.

11:58.389 --> 12:00.590
Man, this is like playing the
coolest video game ever.

12:00.591 --> 12:02.025
My character is Terry.

12:02.026 --> 12:03.960
<i>- It's locked.</i>
- Ooh, kick it down.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.311
Front kick! Front kick!

12:07.915 --> 12:09.866
- All clear.
- Now strafe. Strafe!

12:09.867 --> 12:11.034
<i>I don't know what that means.</i>

12:11.035 --> 12:12.568
- Barrel roll. Duck.
- Duck?

12:12.569 --> 12:14.070
Just tell me where to go, man.

12:14.071 --> 12:16.339
Wait a minute. Slide one
of your feet forward.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.807
Now switch.

12:17.808 --> 12:20.610
<i>Now punch both your fists
forward at the same time.</i>

12:20.611 --> 12:21.911
Are you making me do the running man?

12:21.912 --> 12:23.446
Yeah. The original one.

12:23.447 --> 12:24.881
Excluding the movie.

12:24.882 --> 12:26.482
And Stephen King's classic short story.

12:26.483 --> 12:27.717
So, the third iteration.

12:27.718 --> 12:29.018
<i>I'm going off on my own.</i>

12:29.019 --> 12:30.386
He has sentience.

12:30.387 --> 12:31.754
It's "Westworld."

12:31.755 --> 12:34.757
Oh, wait a minute, Sarge. I
don't have eyes on that room.

12:34.758 --> 12:37.527
<i>Hang on. I'll find it.</i>

12:37.528 --> 12:40.780
Oh, no. Sarge, just hang
on. I'm coming for you.

12:47.265 --> 12:48.406
Drop the weapon.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.235
- You drop your weapon.
- Okay, stay cool.

12:51.236 --> 12:53.504
We can work this out. I'm a
trained hostage negotiator.

12:53.505 --> 12:55.806
I got my friend's sperm back
from his ex-wife last year.

12:55.807 --> 12:58.742
Well, she destroyed half of it,
and he decided to adopt, but...

12:58.743 --> 13:00.211
- Peralta!
- Right. Sorry.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.370
What do you want?

13:01.391 --> 13:03.291
You let me walk out of this
building and get into a car.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.427
- If anyone tries to stop me...
- Got him.

13:05.428 --> 13:08.263
Oh, well, you know, I think
that makes it four to four.

13:08.264 --> 13:10.332
No. No. You don't get
credit for this guy.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.633
I was in the middle of negotiating,

13:11.634 --> 13:13.435
and he was about to give
up... Tell him, guy.

13:13.436 --> 13:14.536
No, I was probably gonna kill him,

13:14.537 --> 13:16.071
then let you kill me.

13:16.072 --> 13:18.440
Oh, my God. I should've
been way more scared.

13:18.441 --> 13:20.509
Well, there's just one convict left.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.144
Whoever finds him wins.

13:22.145 --> 13:24.146
Yeah. I guess you could say he's...

13:24.147 --> 13:25.547
the Golden Snitch.

13:25.548 --> 13:27.649
Wait. Was that a "Harry
Potter" reference?

13:27.650 --> 13:29.384
It most definitely was.
I started reading them

13:29.385 --> 13:30.919
- 'cause you love them so much.
- And?

13:30.920 --> 13:32.020
You were right. They're incredible.

13:32.021 --> 13:33.555
Remember when I called
in sick the other day?

13:33.556 --> 13:35.123
I was at home reading
"Order of the Phoenix."

13:35.124 --> 13:37.025
Oh, this makes me so happy!

13:37.026 --> 13:38.360
How sad is it when Cedric dies?

13:38.361 --> 13:39.394
I was crushed.

13:39.395 --> 13:41.730
Literally crying on the toilet.

13:41.731 --> 13:42.764
Aww.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.666
Guys. The fugitive. The bet?

13:44.667 --> 13:45.700
Right.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.102
I'm gonna catch this last fugitive,

13:47.103 --> 13:48.537
win the bet, and then
we're gonna live together

13:48.538 --> 13:49.838
for the rest of our relationship.

13:49.839 --> 13:52.274
Just you and me and towel makes three.

13:52.275 --> 13:54.009
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

13:54.010 --> 13:55.477
Just so you know, at the
end of the sixth book,

13:55.478 --> 13:56.478
Snape kills...

13:56.479 --> 13:58.013
La-la-la-la-! No spoilies!

13:58.014 --> 13:59.181
Terry, let's go.

14:01.684 --> 14:02.951
It really sounds Slavic.

14:02.952 --> 14:04.953
Does anyone here know
any Slavic languages?

14:04.954 --> 14:08.423
Oh, I'm great at languages. Watch this.

14:08.424 --> 14:12.461
Hello! I am Hitchcock!

14:12.462 --> 14:15.330
Thank you for
the cookie-pizza idea!

14:15.331 --> 14:18.700
I believe it was human
rights leader Abdala

14:18.701 --> 14:22.604
who once said "When the
choir shouts the loudest",

14:22.605 --> 14:25.273
the most powerful one is silent."

14:25.274 --> 14:26.641
That doesn't even make any sense.

14:26.642 --> 14:28.376
Well, I might have
paraphrased it incorrectly.

14:28.377 --> 14:31.146
But allow me to introduce to you Rob.

14:31.147 --> 14:33.715
Rob, come on in.

14:33.716 --> 14:35.016
He called the tip line.

14:35.017 --> 14:37.752
But he's so... not crazy-looking.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.222
Rosa, have Abdala and
I taught you nothing

14:40.223 --> 14:41.523
about stereotyping?

14:41.524 --> 14:42.624
I'm beginning to feel

14:42.625 --> 14:44.459
like you're our biggest
project, sweetie.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.161
That's enough. What did he tell you?

14:46.162 --> 14:48.697
Well, let's find out, okay? Together.

14:48.698 --> 14:51.500
Rob, do you want to share your
experience with the group?

14:51.501 --> 14:52.767
Gladly.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.769
Okay, so, you know how
there's a subterranean race

14:54.770 --> 14:56.438
of lizard-people living beneath the city

14:56.439 --> 14:58.189
who control our minds
with their pheromones?

14:59.926 --> 15:00.959
Okay, he's a wackadoodle.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.711
Gina, get your wackadoodle out of here.

15:02.712 --> 15:05.080
<i>It's been two hours, and
nothing on the last guy.</i>

15:05.081 --> 15:06.081
He's gonna get away.

15:06.082 --> 15:07.549
Where are you, number nine?

15:07.550 --> 15:11.520
Think. If I was an escaped
murderer, where would I hide?

15:11.521 --> 15:12.888
Where?

15:12.889 --> 15:14.489
Oh, I have no idea. I
just thought if I gasped

15:14.490 --> 15:15.757
I could force an epiphany.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.125
And I did.

15:17.126 --> 15:18.360
No, that didn't work either.

15:18.361 --> 15:20.128
Or did it? Still no.

15:20.129 --> 15:22.230
- Unless...
- Stop it, Jake!

15:22.231 --> 15:25.066
Well, Marshawn Lynch will
not leave your office.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.868
He has now pulled up one
of those wedding proposal

15:26.869 --> 15:28.703
viral videos on his phone and is crying.

15:28.704 --> 15:30.338
What did I do to deserve this?

15:30.339 --> 15:31.773
Well, I haven't fared any better.

15:31.774 --> 15:33.842
She keeps drawing her
stupid circle pictures

15:33.843 --> 15:35.323
and then running off to the bathroom.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.780
We get it. You have a bum-tum. Yes.

15:38.781 --> 15:41.082
Ugh! You think you guys have it rough.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.051
I've been stuck here
listening to crazy Rob

15:43.052 --> 15:45.287
spew his insane garbage

15:45.288 --> 15:47.422
What happened to your
positive attitude, Abdala?

15:47.423 --> 15:49.190
Don't even say that name, all right?

15:49.191 --> 15:51.026
I tweeted him and got nothing.

15:51.027 --> 15:53.862
Meanwhile, Rob tweets him some
crap about lizard-people,

15:53.863 --> 15:57.265
he's like, "Oh, retweet,
oh, fave" everything.

15:57.266 --> 15:58.633
I just told him I saw one of them

15:58.634 --> 16:00.902
slip back into his lizard
home under the streets.

16:00.903 --> 16:02.270
That's where they make their soup.

16:02.271 --> 16:04.272
Oh, my God. He's onto something.

16:04.273 --> 16:05.640
Captain, don't try to be nice

16:05.641 --> 16:07.142
by giving a crazy person a voice.

16:07.143 --> 16:09.144
Plus, we've already learned
that human rights are crap.

16:09.145 --> 16:10.745
No, he said that the lizard-people live

16:10.746 --> 16:11.746
under the streets.

16:11.747 --> 16:13.415
He means the sewers. He saw someone go

16:13.416 --> 16:14.950
from the van into the sewers.

16:14.951 --> 16:16.551
Look.

16:16.552 --> 16:17.736
It's a manhole cover.

16:20.590 --> 16:22.257
<i>Peralta, Santiago?</i>

16:22.258 --> 16:23.892
- Yeah, we're here.
- Us too, Captain.

16:23.893 --> 16:25.393
We have a lead. One of our witnesses saw

16:25.394 --> 16:27.762
the last convict, George
Gessilnick, the murderer,

16:27.763 --> 16:29.931
go down into a manhole and
escape into the sewer

16:29.932 --> 16:31.032
near the crash site.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.167
Copy that. We're on it.

16:32.168 --> 16:33.918
Yeah, so are we. We're also on it.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.428
Whoop! Back it up a little bit.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.197
Forward.

16:47.634 --> 16:49.918
Back.

16:49.919 --> 16:51.786
Forward.

16:51.787 --> 16:53.688
Back.

16:53.689 --> 16:55.790
Forward.

16:55.791 --> 16:56.858
Back.

16:58.394 --> 16:59.394
Forward.

16:59.395 --> 17:02.330
And we're good to go.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.001
Oh, almost clipped the mailbox.

17:06.002 --> 17:07.151
Heh. Close call.

17:10.388 --> 17:13.958
Please let this muck be water.
Please let this muck be water.

17:13.959 --> 17:15.559
I won't be able to hug
Nicolaj for a month.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.894
He doesn't have all his shots yet.

17:16.895 --> 17:19.446
Shh. I think I heard something.

17:22.117 --> 17:24.035
I can't believe Leonardo lived in this.

17:24.036 --> 17:26.503
I mean, Michelangelo I get.
He's kind of a sloppy dude.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.173
- But Leo is so fastidious.
- Jake, shut up.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.574
Sarge, we're in a sewer.

17:30.575 --> 17:32.276
I'm goin'st to talk about the Turtles.

17:32.277 --> 17:34.362
No, Jake. Shut up. I hear something.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.049
NYPD! Freeze!

17:38.050 --> 17:40.384
NYPD! Keep your hands
where we can see them.

17:40.385 --> 17:42.019
You have the
right to remain silent.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.355
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.723
You have the right to an attorney.

17:45.724 --> 17:46.724
If you cannot afford an attorney,

17:46.725 --> 17:48.059
one will be appointed for you.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.360
Why did you stop?

17:49.361 --> 17:50.661
I'm done. You win.

17:50.662 --> 17:51.996
W-what?

17:51.997 --> 17:54.131
I love you. I want to move
in to your apartment.

17:54.132 --> 17:55.366
Really?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.667
I love you too.

17:56.668 --> 17:58.135
Oh, my God, what a beautiful moment.

17:58.136 --> 18:00.504
And, you guys, Amy's
ovulating as we speak!

18:00.505 --> 18:01.772
- What?
- Charles!

18:01.773 --> 18:03.733
All right, head to the back.
You're going to jail.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.446
Hey.

18:08.447 --> 18:10.915
I don't get it. Why did
you decide to let me win?

18:10.916 --> 18:13.150
I don't know. When we were back there

18:13.151 --> 18:14.552
racing through the Miranda Rights,

18:14.553 --> 18:16.087
I just looked over at you and thought,

18:16.088 --> 18:17.588
"You're awesome.

18:17.589 --> 18:19.090
And you're good at doing things."

18:19.091 --> 18:22.693
I mean, sure, I'll miss towel,
but your happiness is worth

18:22.694 --> 18:24.445
way more than winning some stupid bet.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.300
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

18:29.301 --> 18:31.702
Your apartment is better than
mine in every way imaginable.

18:31.703 --> 18:32.770
You want to know what
my first thought was

18:32.771 --> 18:33.904
when we dropped into the sewer?

18:33.905 --> 18:34.939
"Smells like home."

18:34.940 --> 18:36.107
He's lying, Amy.

18:36.108 --> 18:37.942
His first thought was
about the Ninja Turtles.

18:37.943 --> 18:39.593
Come on, Terry. We were in a sewer.

18:39.594 --> 18:41.378
He's gon'sta think about the Turtles.

18:41.379 --> 18:42.713
Yeah, I'm gon'sta, Terry.

18:42.714 --> 18:44.515
- Quit being such a Malfoy.
- Yeah, Terry.

18:44.516 --> 18:46.484
Guys, we have a problem.

18:46.485 --> 18:47.685
He's not our convict.

18:47.686 --> 18:49.320
What? The guy in the orange jumpsuit

18:49.321 --> 18:51.288
that we found hiding in the
sewer is not our convict?

18:51.289 --> 18:52.556
He's our van driver.

18:52.557 --> 18:53.924
A man came to me last week.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.310
He told me I had to help
Gessilnick escape from jail.

18:56.311 --> 18:57.795
He had pictures of my family.

18:57.796 --> 18:59.196
He said he'd kill them if I didn't help.

18:59.197 --> 19:01.499
So, I crashed the van, and
Gessilnick took my clothes.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.100
But then where's the guy we
thought was the van driver?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.369
He vanished. George Gessilnick,

19:05.370 --> 19:07.204
posing as a Department
of Corrections driver,

19:07.205 --> 19:08.405
was taken to the hospital,

19:08.406 --> 19:09.840
where he escaped some hours later.

19:09.841 --> 19:11.542
He's highly dangerous, probably armed,

19:11.543 --> 19:12.810
and could be anywhere.

19:12.811 --> 19:14.812
Detective Diaz has some
background information

19:14.813 --> 19:15.813
to help in the search.

19:15.814 --> 19:17.515
So this is one scary dude.

19:17.516 --> 19:18.849
We don't have a complete
rap sheet on him

19:18.850 --> 19:20.284
because he's had so many aliases,

19:20.285 --> 19:22.520
but we know he's killed
at least five people.

19:22.521 --> 19:24.121
He's been in the system since he was 11.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.124
That's when he stole $4,000
from his foster family

19:27.125 --> 19:28.993
and burned their house down.

19:28.994 --> 19:32.163
Wait a minute. This
is the foster family?

19:32.164 --> 19:33.397
- Yeah. Why?
- Did you see

19:33.398 --> 19:35.132
who the brother is?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.600
I need to get a message to somebody.

19:36.601 --> 19:39.103
This is very important. Tell him
Jake Peralta wants to see him.

19:39.104 --> 19:41.189
I'm not after him. I just need his help.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.407
Hello?

19:46.778 --> 19:48.546
I followed all your rules.

19:48.547 --> 19:51.083
I'm unarmed. I'm not wearing a wire.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.101
I came alone. There's no backup.

19:56.272 --> 19:59.140
Come on, man. I need your help
to take down your brother.

20:03.346 --> 20:05.529
Doug Judy. The Pontiac Bandit.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.614
Hey, baby.

20:06.615 --> 20:07.731
Nice legs.

20:07.732 --> 20:08.999
Why are you in your boxers?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.101
So you would know I'm
not wearing a wire.

20:11.102 --> 20:12.703
Your buddy Scott said I had to.

20:12.704 --> 20:14.805
Oh, that makes sense. Scott's a perv.

20:14.806 --> 20:17.141
Hey, Scott, wherever
you're watching from,

20:17.142 --> 20:18.309
go home!

20:18.310 --> 20:19.944
Sorry, man.

20:19.945 --> 20:21.178
So, what's so important?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.013
I'm looking for your
foster brother, George.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.815
Hate the guy. Stole from my mom,

20:24.816 --> 20:25.950
burned our house down.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.151
Worst of all, he ran off

20:27.152 --> 20:29.653
with my LP of Phil Collins'
"No Jacket Required."

20:29.654 --> 20:30.855
It's my favorite album.

20:30.856 --> 20:31.989
Haven't heard it in 20 years.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.991
I mean, can't you just stream it?

20:33.992 --> 20:36.760
Can't do that to Phil.
"Sussudio" demands vinyl.

20:36.761 --> 20:38.762
Right. Vinyl and whatnot. Okay, well,

20:38.763 --> 20:41.165
George is a murderer now and
he just escaped from prison.

20:41.166 --> 20:43.000
We think he might be trying
to flee the country.

20:43.001 --> 20:44.034
You want me to help you catch him?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.703
Like when X-men teamed up with Magneto

20:45.704 --> 20:46.937
to stop Apocalypse.

20:46.938 --> 20:48.706
- I heard that one was bad.
- Wasn't great.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.541
- I still want to see it though.
- I'd watch it again.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.976
- So, does that mean you're in?
- Course I am.

20:51.977 --> 20:54.511
Damn, it feels good to be
on the same team for once.

20:54.512 --> 20:57.147
A cop and a criminal
working together.

20:57.148 --> 20:58.916
We need a theme song.

21:01.536 --> 21:02.953
Oh!

21:09.728 --> 21:13.664
You gave him full immunity?
Are you insane?

21:13.665 --> 21:15.165
You told me to cut a deal.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.502
I thought you'd maybe drop
charges on one or two felonies.

21:18.503 --> 21:20.905
But do you know how many
crimes we're forgiving?

21:20.906 --> 21:22.589
- Six...
- That's not so bad.

21:22.590 --> 21:24.441
- Hundred!
- Oh, that's way more.

21:24.442 --> 21:26.010
"Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto.

21:26.011 --> 21:27.878
Grand theft auto. Dog fraud."

21:27.879 --> 21:29.647
I sold a guy a fake Pekinese.

21:29.648 --> 21:31.048
'Twas a cat.

21:31.049 --> 21:34.084
You will not win me over
with your use of "'twas."

21:34.085 --> 21:35.619
'Twasn't trying to.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.655
You're clearly friends with this man,

21:37.656 --> 21:39.857
and you've lost your
objectivity, Peralta.

21:39.858 --> 21:41.659
Or have you lost your objectivity?

21:41.660 --> 21:42.726
What are you doing?

21:42.727 --> 21:43.861
My bad. I thought we were leaving.

21:43.862 --> 21:45.996
No. I'm just making a
point here. Sit down.

21:45.997 --> 21:47.498
Look, sir. There's a triple-murderer

21:47.499 --> 21:49.500
loose in Brooklyn, and it's
our job to bring him in,

21:49.501 --> 21:51.635
even if that means forgiving
a guy who stole some cars,

21:51.636 --> 21:53.737
and, yes, sold a few cats as dogs.

21:53.738 --> 21:54.838
More than a few.

21:54.839 --> 21:56.106
Weird how many people fell for that.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.608
Plus, his deal is conditional.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.043
If Judy doesn't lead us to his brother,

21:59.044 --> 22:00.144
he doesn't get immunity.

22:00.145 --> 22:02.046
Look, Cap, I want to
see George behind bars

22:02.047 --> 22:03.047
as much as you do.

22:03.048 --> 22:04.415
I hate my brother.

22:04.416 --> 22:05.549
You can relate to that, right, sir?

22:05.550 --> 22:06.784
Remember how furious you got

22:06.785 --> 22:08.819
that time your sister
ended an email with "thx"

22:08.820 --> 22:09.820
instead of "thanks"?

22:09.821 --> 22:11.188
Why would you bring that up?

22:11.189 --> 22:12.389
- It seemed pertinent.
- Fine.

22:12.390 --> 22:13.791
Let's see where this leads.

22:13.792 --> 22:14.792
Dismissed.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.461
So we don't know if anybody
helped George Judy

22:17.462 --> 22:18.662
escape from this hospital.

22:18.663 --> 22:20.464
Security cameras show him
entering this courtyard,

22:20.465 --> 22:21.632
but never coming back out.

22:21.633 --> 22:22.666
The dude just vanished.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.035
Ugh. Terry hates hospitals.

22:25.036 --> 22:26.036
They reek of death.

22:26.037 --> 22:27.338
Ahem.

22:27.339 --> 22:29.273
Oh, not you, ma'am.

22:29.274 --> 22:31.225
You reek of life.

22:33.429 --> 22:34.912
Maybe he went up the wall

22:34.913 --> 22:36.130
like this.

22:39.084 --> 22:41.251
Never mind. It's not possible.

22:41.252 --> 22:42.920
You sure?

22:45.924 --> 22:48.492
Damn, Rosa! How did you do that?

22:48.493 --> 22:49.810
I have a dark past.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.001
Now you know my deepest shame.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.036
Cool. Well, now that I saw you do it,

22:59.037 --> 23:00.554
I get how to do it too.

23:03.493 --> 23:06.310
Ooh, damn, Terry.

23:06.311 --> 23:08.145
Hey, guys. Guess what.

23:08.146 --> 23:10.280
To thank you for being
such good friends,

23:10.281 --> 23:12.282
I picked up a big old basket of muffins.

23:12.283 --> 23:13.550
Follow me.

23:13.551 --> 23:15.719
- Come on!
- I got all kinds of muffins!

23:15.720 --> 23:18.055
Blueberry muffins, poppy seed muffins,

23:18.056 --> 23:20.758
banana nut muffins, chocolate chip...

23:20.759 --> 23:23.360
Ooh, wait, there are no muffins.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.495
What's happening now?

23:24.496 --> 23:26.397
How's it feel being lied to, Huh?

23:26.398 --> 23:28.599
I mean, I'm okay. I wasn't
really that invested

23:28.600 --> 23:30.000
- in the muffins.
- I was.

23:30.001 --> 23:31.368
You guys thought you could
keep a secret from me?

23:31.369 --> 23:32.903
Well, I know everything.

23:32.904 --> 23:35.439
Hitchcock left his phone
in the bathroom again,

23:35.440 --> 23:37.074
and guess what I found on it.

23:37.075 --> 23:38.909
I needed the cash. I didn't
know they'd be filming.

23:38.910 --> 23:41.779
Text chains. Dozens of text chains.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.747
And I'm not on any of them.

23:43.748 --> 23:45.516
Take a look at this board.

23:45.517 --> 23:49.219
There's an Amy-Gina-Terry-
Hitchcock-Rosa-Jake chain.

23:49.220 --> 23:52.956
There's a Hitchcock-Terry-
Amy-Rosa Chain.

23:52.957 --> 23:56.326
There's even a Hitchcock-Gina-
Scully chain.

23:56.327 --> 23:57.995
I mean, what the hell happens on that?

23:57.996 --> 24:00.397
Well, we mostly just exchange
"Game of Thrones" theories.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.332
The little guy is gonna marry a dragon.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.333
We think.

24:03.334 --> 24:04.968
Well, one thing's for sure:

24:04.969 --> 24:07.104
Charles Boyle...

24:07.105 --> 24:08.405
is off the chains.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.773
I'm sorry.

24:09.774 --> 24:12.226
We only excluded you
because you're kind of...

24:12.227 --> 24:13.410
an over-texter.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.446
Over-texter? That's not even a thing.

24:15.447 --> 24:17.281
Oh really? So you don't
remember the time

24:17.282 --> 24:20.451
you sent 97 unanswered texts
in a five-minute span?

24:20.452 --> 24:22.619
My phone vibrated itself off the desk.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.321
I think it was committing suicide.

24:24.322 --> 24:26.423
It's okay. This isn't the first
time I've been left out.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.293
At camp, nobody would
be friends with me.

24:29.294 --> 24:30.928
I had to hang out with the lunch ladies.

24:30.929 --> 24:35.032
After summer ended, they never
replied to any of my letters.

24:35.033 --> 24:36.600
Oh, this is really sad.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.569
There's just no muffins at all.

24:38.570 --> 24:40.304
- Kaboom!
- What's this?

24:40.305 --> 24:41.605
That is the art auction

24:41.606 --> 24:43.740
that George Judy will
be robbing tonight.

24:43.741 --> 24:45.576
- Why is it so sticky?
- I was eating sour straws.

24:45.577 --> 24:47.611
It's crazy that's what
you're choosing to focus on.

24:47.612 --> 24:48.879
Doug Judy came through for us.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.063
That's what George is after:

24:50.064 --> 24:52.549
a bejeweled egg worth $20 million.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.785
That's a nice egg, but how
do you know he'll be there?

24:54.786 --> 24:56.954
Doug's boy Parker said he
kept asking about the place.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.555
And what does this Parker do?

24:58.556 --> 25:00.224
You know, I don't know.
I can't really recall.

25:00.225 --> 25:01.458
Some sort of auto-industry professional.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.160
Maybe, like, a car thief
or some such whatnot.

25:03.161 --> 25:05.896
Oh, I see. So the only
thing we have to go on is

25:05.897 --> 25:07.798
the word of one of
your criminal friends?

25:07.799 --> 25:09.500
Criminals? That's how you see us?

25:09.501 --> 25:12.569
Is it a crime to steal
bread to feed your family?

25:12.570 --> 25:15.272
Or to sell some weed so
you can buy video games?

25:15.273 --> 25:17.608
Or to steal video games because
you smoked all that weed

25:17.609 --> 25:19.743
- you were supposed to sell?
- Yes, all of those are crimes.

25:19.744 --> 25:22.446
- Damn. Even the bread one?
- Especially the bread one.

25:22.447 --> 25:24.781
But since this is the
only lead you have,

25:24.782 --> 25:25.816
go do something with it.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.918
Oh, we'll go do something with it.

25:27.919 --> 25:30.287
We'll go do something
with the hell out of it.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.730
No, no, no.

25:39.731 --> 25:40.731
He's not a cop.

25:40.732 --> 25:42.499
He can't be wearing any of this.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.667
It's just a windbreaker.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.502
It's not like I gave
him a badge and a gun.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.704
- Uh, he has both of those things.
- It's not loaded.

25:47.705 --> 25:49.940
I just want to cock it and
say a cool cop catch phrase.

25:51.242 --> 25:53.877
New York's finest just
got a whole lot finer.

25:53.878 --> 25:55.212
Give me that.

25:55.213 --> 25:56.747
I'm putting myself on this case.

25:56.748 --> 25:58.649
All right, Captain.

25:58.650 --> 26:01.151
Looks like New York's finest
just got a whole lot...

26:01.152 --> 26:02.619
- Let's go!
- All right.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.283
Whoo. Okay.

26:09.284 --> 26:11.886
How do I look? Like I'm about to
buy a bunch of expensive art?

26:11.887 --> 26:13.788
Hell, yeah. And not
just paintings either.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.162
You look statue rich.

26:16.164 --> 26:17.898
I didn't know we'd have to valet.

26:17.899 --> 26:19.166
Perhaps I shouldn't have brought Gertie.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.367
Who's Gertie?

26:20.368 --> 26:22.736
That foxy little she-devil
we just drove here in.

26:22.737 --> 26:24.305
Gertie? No, man.

26:24.306 --> 26:26.540
A car's gotta have a
sexy name, like Brooke,

26:26.541 --> 26:28.909
or Tiffany, or Sandra, or Candice.

26:28.910 --> 26:31.512
Yeah, or Suzie, or Dana, or Karen.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.681
Oh, no, wait. That's my mom's name.

26:33.682 --> 26:35.516
- Why did I say my mom's name?
- Ugh.

26:35.517 --> 26:38.319
The sight of another man
inside her makes me sick.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.821
Yeah. I dislike this
conversation very much.

26:40.822 --> 26:42.656
Treat her gently!

26:42.657 --> 26:44.525
You know that's not a nice car, right?

26:44.526 --> 26:45.859
Say that again.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.094
Damn, Cap. Be cool.

26:47.095 --> 26:49.780
Say that again.

26:51.116 --> 26:52.319
That's what I thought.

26:53.301 --> 26:54.351
I'll be in the venue.

26:55.888 --> 26:57.905
- Come on, Boyle.
- What's this about?

26:57.906 --> 26:59.640
Look, if you're leading me to some sort

26:59.641 --> 27:02.209
of big surprise apology
where everyone's there

27:02.210 --> 27:04.745
and you all want me to join
your stupid text chains,

27:04.746 --> 27:06.113
I am 100% in.

27:06.114 --> 27:08.515
These last 24 hours have just been hell.

27:08.516 --> 27:11.185
Oh, it's just my former
lover. Hello, sister.

27:11.186 --> 27:13.520
Ugh, I hate when you say
those things back-to-back.

27:13.521 --> 27:15.222
- Here.
- You took my phone?

27:15.223 --> 27:17.257
Yeah. I had to delete your GIF keyboard

27:17.258 --> 27:19.727
and your three "Property
Brothers" emoji apps.

27:19.728 --> 27:21.562
Wait. Did you delete them because...

27:21.563 --> 27:23.630
Yeah. You're on the office text chain.

27:23.631 --> 27:25.466
Are you serious? This is amazing.

27:25.467 --> 27:27.034
Yeah, well I was totally against it,

27:27.035 --> 27:29.570
but Amy felt bad because
you seemed so pathetic.

27:29.571 --> 27:30.637
- Don't say that.
- It worked!

27:30.638 --> 27:31.872
I mean, your little camp story.

27:31.873 --> 27:33.941
Was the saddest childhood
memory I've ever heard,

27:33.942 --> 27:35.876
and I've listened to Amy
talking about attending

27:35.877 --> 27:37.911
"the crossing guard's jamboree."

27:37.912 --> 27:39.880
That was fun! We were directing traffic

27:39.881 --> 27:41.081
in the hotel hallways.

27:41.082 --> 27:42.583
People were freaking out.

27:42.584 --> 27:44.385
Mm-hmm. Just don't make us regret this.

27:44.386 --> 27:45.552
I won't. I swear I won't.

27:45.553 --> 27:47.305
I gotta tell my dad.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.190
I know you weren't on board with this,

27:50.191 --> 27:51.892
but look how happy we made him.

27:51.893 --> 27:53.727
- And at no cost to our...
- oh.

27:53.728 --> 27:55.562
- And here it comes.
- No.

27:55.563 --> 27:57.765
- That was just one...
- uh-oh.

27:57.766 --> 27:59.533
I bet he's just getting it

27:59.534 --> 28:00.901
- out of his system.
- Oh, yeah.

28:00.902 --> 28:02.569
I'm sure he'll be brief.

28:02.570 --> 28:04.872
Apparently the Tsar of Russia
gave that bejeweled egg

28:04.873 --> 28:06.306
to his girlfriend as a present.

28:06.307 --> 28:08.442
I've never gotten a bejeweled
anything. Stupid Amy.

28:08.443 --> 28:11.278
Well, I highly doubt our
murderer is gonna show up here.

28:11.279 --> 28:13.113
Doug Judy said he's be
here, and I believe him.

28:13.114 --> 28:15.649
Cap, got some hors d'oeuvres.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.351
I don't know what you
like, so I guessed:

28:17.352 --> 28:19.219
the radishes they put on
the side for decoration?

28:19.220 --> 28:21.655
Mmm, thank you. Cut into a flower?

28:21.656 --> 28:22.923
Where are we, Las Vegas?

28:22.924 --> 28:24.525
Guys, look over there by the hallway.

28:24.526 --> 28:25.926
See the woman in the red?

28:25.927 --> 28:27.761
I think that's my brother's
girlfriend, Fran.

28:27.762 --> 28:29.680
I don't want her to recognize me.

28:29.681 --> 28:31.632
Does she have a scar on her left cheek?

28:31.633 --> 28:33.500
Maybe. What's the shape of the scar?

28:33.501 --> 28:35.302
- Just a general slash shape.
- Oh, darn.

28:35.303 --> 28:36.837
I've been reading a lot
of "Harry Potter" lately,

28:36.838 --> 28:38.105
and I was hoping for something more fun.

28:38.106 --> 28:39.673
Okay, I'll head towards her.

28:39.674 --> 28:43.977
You go around back in case
she makes a break for it.

28:43.978 --> 28:45.579
She's on the move.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.214
Excuse me, ma'am. Oh.

28:47.215 --> 28:50.184
- No, please stop.
- Freeze. NYPD.

28:50.185 --> 28:52.553
- What's going on?
- No scar. It's not Fran.

28:52.554 --> 28:53.987
Then why was she running?

28:53.988 --> 28:56.123
Because a strange guy started
following me to the bathroom.

28:56.124 --> 28:57.257
Right. Because men are horrible

28:57.258 --> 28:58.692
and the world is a nightmare. Yeah.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.828
- Oh, no. Where's Doug Judy?
- Where we left him. Why?

29:00.829 --> 29:02.830
Scarface Fran is a ruse.

29:02.831 --> 29:04.832
He wanted us out of there
so he can help his brother

29:04.833 --> 29:06.817
steal the egg!

29:09.121 --> 29:11.004
Check it out. Shot glasses of soup.

29:11.005 --> 29:13.140
Oh, you wondering how
I got the whole tray?

29:13.141 --> 29:14.441
Charmed it right out of her

29:20.399 --> 29:21.431
You want some soup?

29:28.740 --> 29:32.092
- This where you been all day?
- Yep. Just looking for clues.

29:32.093 --> 29:34.661
Trying to see how George Judy escaped.

29:34.662 --> 29:36.864
- You're pretty sweaty.
- Terry runs hot.

29:36.865 --> 29:38.298
Terry runs hot.

29:38.299 --> 29:39.533
You're trying to see if you
can do that wall climb,

29:39.534 --> 29:41.101
- aren't you?
- Yeah.

29:41.102 --> 29:43.904
And I can't. I'm old.

29:43.905 --> 29:45.839
Because you can't parkour up a wall?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.307
It's everything.

29:47.308 --> 29:49.009
The TV's always too quiet.

29:49.010 --> 29:51.812
I don't like how baggy
basketball shorts are.

29:51.813 --> 29:54.548
I even shook my fist at some
skateboarders the other day.

29:54.549 --> 29:56.550
- Oof.
- And there's something worse.

29:56.551 --> 29:58.318
Way, way worse.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.225
Terry needs reading glasses.

30:05.226 --> 30:07.694
- It's not that bad, Sarge.
- Yes, it is!

30:07.695 --> 30:09.696
I used to be "Batman."

30:09.697 --> 30:11.431
Now I'm his dad.

30:11.432 --> 30:15.869
His dumb, weak, getting
shot at the opera dad.

30:15.870 --> 30:17.905
Okay, auction over.

30:17.906 --> 30:19.172
I can't believe you thought Doug Judy

30:19.173 --> 30:20.774
was tricking us so he
could steal the egg.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.342
If anyone was stealing
any eggs, it was you

30:22.343 --> 30:24.077
'cause you have egg all over your face.

30:24.078 --> 30:26.079
Is that why you've been so
quiet these last four minutes?

30:26.080 --> 30:27.681
- You had to think of that?
- Mm-hmm. Was it worth it?

30:27.682 --> 30:29.416
- Hell, yeah.
- Ah, venomous burn.

30:29.417 --> 30:31.084
Suck out the poison.

30:33.121 --> 30:34.521
Wow.

30:34.522 --> 30:36.557
He may not have been pulling
something back there,

30:36.558 --> 30:38.358
but both of you were
wrong about George Judy.

30:38.359 --> 30:40.694
He never showed. We wasted a day,

30:40.695 --> 30:43.363
and if anyone has egg on
their faces, it's you two.

30:43.364 --> 30:46.466
Doug Egg and Egg Peralta.

30:46.467 --> 30:48.368
That's actually kind of a dope name.

30:48.369 --> 30:50.137
What's going on out there?

30:50.138 --> 30:53.140
Hey, Jake Peralta, NYPD.
What happened here?

30:53.141 --> 30:55.342
Somebody knocked out the
valet, stole all the cars.

30:55.343 --> 30:57.911
- Every single one.
- So George was here.

30:57.912 --> 30:59.880
He wasn't after the egg,
he was after the cars.

30:59.881 --> 31:04.117
Well, looks like Doug Judy was
right after all, huh, Captain?

31:04.118 --> 31:05.385
Why aren't you saying anything?

31:05.386 --> 31:06.887
Is it because you're so
embarrassed for being wrong?

31:06.888 --> 31:08.382
Gertie!

31:11.893 --> 31:14.570
Shut up! Shut up!

31:16.424 --> 31:18.374
I don't get it. Why would George Judy

31:18.376 --> 31:19.877
steal all these cars and not the egg?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.478
Easier to sell if you're in a hurry.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.581
Plus these are some valuable vehicles.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.516
- Bugatti, Ferrari...
- Gertie.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.151
I don't think Gertie was
a prime target, sir.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.820
Do you know how much custom
work there was on her?

31:29.821 --> 31:32.189
I disabled the FM
function from the radio.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.425
The guy said, "Oh, you
can just not use it,"

31:34.426 --> 31:36.594
but I said, "Ugh, I'll
always know it's there."

31:36.595 --> 31:39.797
Boom. Shelby Cobra 427SC.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.732
That's a million dollars
on four wheels, baby.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.033
That's what George is after.

31:43.034 --> 31:44.501
How do we even know George did it?

31:44.502 --> 31:45.836
I mean, nobody saw him.

31:45.837 --> 31:49.173
But there was a prolific car
thief at the scene of the crime.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.041
You talking about me? I'm a cop now.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.476
- No, you're not.
- Then why do I have a badge

31:52.477 --> 31:54.311
and a gun?

31:54.312 --> 31:56.046
The thin blue line just
got thick as hell.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.247
- Give me that!
- Come on, Judy.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.482
It's not loaded.

31:58.483 --> 31:59.917
Look, if I was gonna
jack a bunch of cars,

31:59.918 --> 32:01.752
I would bring two of New
York's best detectives with me

32:01.753 --> 32:03.320
to the scene of the crime.

32:03.321 --> 32:04.989
- Aww, you think we're the best?
- Flattery won't work on us.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.690
- What?
- This is nonsense.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.059
- You're off the case.
- Whoa, whoa, sir. Come on.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.628
We're chasing a murderer.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.529
A murderer that just
stole a ton of cars.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.431
Who knows more about that
world than Doug Judy?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.233
Plus remember, he doesn't get immunity

32:16.234 --> 32:17.534
unless he helps us bring his brother in.

32:17.535 --> 32:18.669
I know, but...

32:18.670 --> 32:20.671
Do you want to get back Gertie or not?

32:20.672 --> 32:22.940
- Fine. He's still on the case.
- Ah!

32:42.293 --> 32:44.628
Okay, Charles, I was you
on this text chain.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.231
I really do, but since
you joined yesterday,

32:47.232 --> 32:49.533
you have sent 71 texts.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.236
The rest of the group
collectively has sent two.

32:52.237 --> 32:56.073
You know, honestly, I'd
rather get hit by a bus

32:56.074 --> 32:58.275
than get one more text
from you, Charles.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.210
Fine. I've been kicked
out of things before.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.612
At camp, I found a slam book

33:01.613 --> 33:03.414
that the lunch ladies
had written about me.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.249
I'm sorry, Charles,
but there is no story

33:05.250 --> 33:06.383
sad enough to save you now.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.318
Challenge accepted.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.321
Once, as a tween, I got
my penis entirely...

33:11.322 --> 33:12.556
Okay, stop! No, no, no, no, no.

33:12.557 --> 33:15.292
Our plan was just to teach
you to text better.

33:15.293 --> 33:18.495
You know, a lot of people
like the way I text.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.397
Look, if you can't
accept me for who I am,

33:20.398 --> 33:21.999
- then I don't need this chain.
- Okay, great.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.600
No, no, no, I need to
be included so badly.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.436
I'll do whatever you say. I
literally have zero pride.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.637
And that's what I like to hear.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.939
Oh, Charles.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.475
Okay, so you guys are rich Europeans

33:31.476 --> 33:33.644
looking to buy a Shelby.
I'll make the introductions.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.079
Wait, we can't just be Europeans.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.914
- What country are we from?
- What languages do you speak?

33:36.915 --> 33:40.050
French, Spanish, some Portuguese.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.352
Obviously Greek, enough
Flemish to get by.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.521
Tight. What about you, Peralta?

33:44.522 --> 33:46.857
Um, I can do a pretty
good Italian accent.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.592
"You think you could milk me?"

33:48.593 --> 33:50.627
So you're just doing De Niro
from "Meet the Parents?"

33:50.628 --> 33:52.129
I don't know, am I?

33:52.130 --> 33:53.997
- That's a terrible De Niro.
- I don't know.

33:53.998 --> 33:56.133
- This is De Niro.
- I think it's pretty good.

33:56.134 --> 33:57.968
- Mine's better.
- It's pretty good.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.269
- We'll just make you American.
- Okay.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.139
- Griff.
- Hey, Doug Judy.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.640
- Hey.
- What can I do for you?

34:03.641 --> 34:04.975
Hey, did my brother stop by?

34:04.976 --> 34:07.711
I heard he jacked some nice
cars, and I might have a buyer.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.179
This is Maxime Dubois,
international millionaire.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.216
- Bonjour.
- He doesn't speak any English.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.516
This is his lawyer, Carl Mangerson.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.784
Hey, I'm a lawyer.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.620
Maxine wants to buy a Shelby Cobra.

34:16.621 --> 34:17.721
I hear George might have one.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.356
He just dropped off a few cars,

34:19.357 --> 34:21.958
but he didn't say
anything about no Cobra.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.527
I mostly deal with scrap
and crap, you know?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.130
Son of a bitch.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.965
Hey, hey, is everything
all right here, Maxime?

34:27.966 --> 34:29.299
You're speaking good English.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.302
Eh, just a few phrases he
picked up from movies and such.

34:32.303 --> 34:34.905
He's disappointed. He
really wanted that Cobra.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.373
You know the French, so passionate,

34:36.373 --> 34:38.208
even their skunks. Pepé Le Pew.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.043
It doesn't matter; I'm a
lawyer. No further comments.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.344
Do you know where George is?

34:41.346 --> 34:43.413
Maybe I can do business with him myself.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.715
- Gertie!
- What?

34:44.716 --> 34:48.786
Uh, that was French for...

34:50.321 --> 34:52.005
"I gotta make a phone call."

34:52.005 --> 34:53.824
He's gotta make a phone call.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.192
Frenchmens...

34:55.193 --> 34:58.495
You can't bring them anywhere.

34:58.496 --> 34:59.997
So if George went over that wall,

34:59.998 --> 35:02.666
he would have been caught on
a security camera across...

35:02.667 --> 35:04.802
- Whatcha eating there, Sarge?
- Cream of Wheat.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.804
It's easy to chew, and
it keeps you regular.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.505
It's a favorite dish of the elderly.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.007
Stop freaking out about this.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.842
Yeah, yeah, I know.
"I'm young at heart."

35:11.843 --> 35:13.510
No, you are super old at heart.

35:13.511 --> 35:15.012
You always have been. You love yogurt.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.513
You volunteer at your polling place.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.283
You refuse to deposit
your checks at an ATM.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.084
It's a machine. I don't trust it.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.519
I get what you're saying,

35:22.520 --> 35:25.088
but at least I used to be a
prime physical specimen.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.690
Dude, you have, like, 1% body fat.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.159
Now I'm at 1.8. I'm fat.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.028
I'm a fat, bald old man.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.462
- You shave your head.
- Yeah, Rosa.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.897
Vin Diesel and I shave our heads

35:33.898 --> 35:35.365
because we think it looks good.

35:35.366 --> 35:36.900
Okay, you obviously want to sit here

35:36.901 --> 35:39.436
feeling sorry for yourself,
but we have work to do.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.071
So, I don't know, why don't
I get you a wheelchair

35:41.072 --> 35:44.575
- and a box of diapers.
- The wheelchair!

35:44.576 --> 35:47.311
That's how he escaped. He
dressed up like an old lady.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.679
That orderly is pushing him out.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.113
He did have an accomplice.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.082
I'm gonna find this bastard.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.384
I don't need this anymore.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.253
I should take my jacket, though.

35:56.254 --> 36:00.490
I mean, it's January. I ain't crazy.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.096
Oh, Gertie.

36:10.786 --> 36:12.736
Psst. George is here.

36:12.737 --> 36:16.773
- He's out back.
- Let's go. Right now.

36:16.774 --> 36:18.675
NYPD, don't move!

36:18.676 --> 36:21.662
Crap, he's getting away!

36:23.666 --> 36:25.449
All right.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.484
We can run right through it.
These suits are fire-resistant.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.152
These suits are not fire-resistant.

36:29.153 --> 36:30.821
They're not? Then why
are they so expensive?

36:30.822 --> 36:33.757
Bye, Peralta.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.759
No! Judy!

36:35.760 --> 36:38.679
Both Judys! Judys!

36:41.179 --> 36:42.561
Oh, I can't believe this!

36:42.945 --> 36:44.812
I really thought I could
trust Doug Judy this time.

36:44.814 --> 36:46.915
I kept telling you not to,
but you wouldn't listen.

36:46.917 --> 36:48.952
You were too busy singing your songs

36:48.954 --> 36:50.521
and planning trips to Niagara Falls.

36:50.522 --> 36:51.989
We just said neither
of us had ever been.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.757
There were no hard plans.

36:53.758 --> 36:55.659
Look, it's humiliating.

36:55.660 --> 36:58.496
Doug Judy thought he could
manipulate me, and he could.

36:58.497 --> 37:00.305
I feel like I'm a terrible cop.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.534
Wow, I really thought you
were going to chime in

37:03.535 --> 37:04.502
with something supportive there.

37:04.503 --> 37:05.936
We have to go.

37:05.937 --> 37:07.972
Captain?

37:07.973 --> 37:10.708
Okay, Charles. This is your final exam.

37:10.709 --> 37:11.775
We're gonna show you a text

37:11.776 --> 37:13.677
and then two potential responses.

37:13.678 --> 37:15.513
You need to tell us which
is more appropriate.

37:15.514 --> 37:18.215
Amy writes, "Leaving the
virgin festival..."

37:18.216 --> 37:20.417
- Gina...
- "Be there in ten minutes."

37:20.418 --> 37:22.653
Do you reply,

37:22.654 --> 37:24.488
"I'll be counting down the seconds.

37:24.489 --> 37:28.959
"600, 599, 598, JK, LOL,

37:28.960 --> 37:32.196
"597, 596, smiley face, smiley face,

37:32.197 --> 37:34.131
cat smiley, thumbs up."

37:34.132 --> 37:36.467
Or, "Okay."

37:36.468 --> 37:38.869
It's a trick question. The
text requires no response.

37:38.870 --> 37:42.506
Charles Boyle, welcome back
to the Nine-Nine text chain.

37:42.507 --> 37:44.408
Yes! We should call it
the Nine-Nine party line

37:44.409 --> 37:46.143
- I'll rename the thread.
- Charles.

37:46.144 --> 37:47.845
Sorry. I'll be better. I'll be better.

37:51.182 --> 37:53.551
There's the car. How'd
you know they'd be here?

37:53.552 --> 37:56.153
Detective's intuition.

37:56.154 --> 37:58.222
Okay, fine. We went to
Dave and Buster's together

37:58.223 --> 38:01.358
and got separated, so we
turned on Find My Friends.

38:06.682 --> 38:08.290
The stairs are in the back.

38:09.467 --> 38:10.834
Looking for us?

38:10.835 --> 38:13.820
Put your guns down, turn around slowly.

38:17.526 --> 38:20.144
What the hell, Judy? I
thought we were friends.

38:20.145 --> 38:21.545
I don't know why you thought that.

38:21.546 --> 38:22.713
'Cause you kept saying we were.

38:22.714 --> 38:24.648
We had hard plans to
go to Niagara Falls.

38:24.649 --> 38:26.784
So, bro, you friends with this cop?

38:26.785 --> 38:28.452
Nah. This thirsty-ass bitch

38:28.453 --> 38:29.787
is just desperate for attention.

38:29.788 --> 38:31.322
Thirsty-ass bitch?

38:31.323 --> 38:33.757
Okay, Captain, now I know you're
going to step in and defend me.

38:33.758 --> 38:35.893
Well, you were begging me
to compliment you earlier.

38:35.894 --> 38:37.595
Oh, my God. This is the
worst day of my life.

38:37.596 --> 38:40.264
- Where's Charles?
- So, if you're not friends,

38:40.265 --> 38:41.799
you won't mind if I waste him, right?

38:41.800 --> 38:44.201
Of course he minds. I mean,
sure, we're enemies,

38:44.202 --> 38:46.570
but in, like, a playful
way, like Tom and Jerry.

38:46.571 --> 38:49.753
Oh, my God. Was Tom trying to eat Jerry?

38:50.809 --> 38:52.142
- My whole life is a lie.
- Shoot him.

38:52.143 --> 38:53.944
No, no, no. Those can't
be my last words.

38:53.945 --> 38:56.213
Uh,<i> ay caramba.</i>

38:56.214 --> 38:57.848
What the hell?

39:00.018 --> 39:02.219
Whoops. Looks like somebody
forgot to put bullets

39:02.220 --> 39:04.288
- in his brother's gun.
- Aha!

39:04.289 --> 39:06.090
I knew you didn't betray me.

39:06.091 --> 39:08.292
I said that accusatorily,
but I'm very happy.

39:19.504 --> 39:21.171
- The talking dog died.
- Aww, man.

39:21.172 --> 39:23.190
I know; it was a bummer note to end on.

39:25.260 --> 39:26.910
- You got our orderly.
- Turns out he really didn't

39:26.911 --> 39:27.911
work at the hospital,

39:27.912 --> 39:29.079
but he left his print behind

39:29.080 --> 39:30.748
in the room where he stole the scrubs.

39:30.749 --> 39:32.449
It didn't take long to track him down.

39:32.450 --> 39:34.184
Whoa. With that and the wheelchair,

39:34.185 --> 39:35.953
that's some pretty nice
police work, Sarge.

39:35.954 --> 39:37.688
I know.

39:37.689 --> 39:40.391
You know, my muscles
might not be as strong

39:40.392 --> 39:43.410
as when I was young, but one's stronger:

39:43.411 --> 39:45.696
my big, beefy brain.

39:45.697 --> 39:50.701
Now if you will excuse
me, I have to process...

39:50.702 --> 39:52.102
David Willis.

39:52.103 --> 39:54.338
Aww, you got a little
necklace for your glasses.

39:54.339 --> 39:56.807
I had to. I almost lost them
last night during "Wheel."

39:56.808 --> 40:00.444
Hey, Rosa. Have a hard candy.

40:00.445 --> 40:02.396
Terry is embracing his age.

40:03.532 --> 40:05.049
I just got off the phone with the DA.

40:05.050 --> 40:07.151
And for aiding in the
capture of George Judy,

40:07.152 --> 40:09.186
you have officially
been granted immunity

40:09.187 --> 40:10.521
from all your past crimes.

40:10.522 --> 40:12.156
- So I'm a free man?
- Mm.

40:12.157 --> 40:15.559
Nope, still smells the same.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.960
I'm sorry that I doubted you,

40:16.961 --> 40:18.762
but you did drive off with the
guy that we were chasing.

40:18.763 --> 40:20.497
Had to. I saw he was about to get away,

40:20.498 --> 40:22.633
so I tricked him into
thinking I was on his side.

40:22.634 --> 40:23.934
It's crazy how good I am at your job.

40:23.935 --> 40:26.737
Look, I owe you both an apology.

40:26.738 --> 40:29.406
Doug Judy, I underestimated
your honesty.

40:29.407 --> 40:32.876
And, Peralta, I underestimated
your instincts.

40:32.877 --> 40:34.411
Yeah, I'm gonna need a lot
more from you than that.

40:34.412 --> 40:36.714
Fine. You're a good cop...

40:36.715 --> 40:39.049
even if you are a thirst-ass bitch.

40:39.050 --> 40:41.018
Wow. Okay.

40:41.019 --> 40:43.620
Solved a pretty intense murder,
and just crap all over me.

40:43.621 --> 40:47.891
Hey, Captain, got you a
little something-something.

40:47.892 --> 40:49.193
- Gertie?
- Nope.

40:49.194 --> 40:53.330
But she is the exact same
make, model, and color.

40:53.331 --> 40:55.232
Oh, my God, you stole this.

40:55.233 --> 40:57.568
- I can't be driving a stolen...
- Relax, man.

40:57.569 --> 41:00.003
I bought it at a used car
lot for, like, $600.

41:00.004 --> 41:02.072
- This is not a nice vehicle.
- Yeah, it's not.

41:02.073 --> 41:03.874
And by the way, her name's not Gertie.

41:03.875 --> 41:06.310
It's Sexarella.

41:06.311 --> 41:10.114
Hello, Sexarella.

41:10.115 --> 41:12.382
So, what's next for you, Doug Judy?

41:12.383 --> 41:14.051
I'm turning over a new leaf.

41:14.052 --> 41:15.686
Gonna live that honest life.

41:15.687 --> 41:17.321
Maybe open up a bakery,

41:17.322 --> 41:19.389
buy a little house,
invest in my retirement.

41:19.390 --> 41:20.758
You're gonna go back to
stealing cars immediately,

41:20.759 --> 41:22.126
- aren't you?
- That's very much on the table.

41:22.127 --> 41:24.061
- Yeah.
- And when you do...

41:24.062 --> 41:25.462
- I'll be there to stop you.
- No, you won't.

41:25.463 --> 41:26.997
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

41:26.998 --> 41:28.766
- Yes, I will.
- I'm gonna miss you, man.

41:28.767 --> 41:31.435
- I'm gonna miss you, brother.
- Good-bye, little Fievel.

41:31.436 --> 41:33.470
Good-bye, Papa.

41:36.474 --> 41:37.875
- Cool. All right, peace out.
- Uh-huh.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.743
- It was good to see you.
- Good to see you, man.

41:39.744 --> 41:41.779
Hey, you guys, I thought
of a funny response

41:41.780 --> 41:43.313
to Terry's text from earlier.

41:43.314 --> 41:44.648
Would you mind taking a
look before I hit send?

41:44.649 --> 41:46.950
Charles, you've trained
for this moment, okay?

41:46.951 --> 41:48.469
We trust you. Just send it.

41:48.470 --> 41:52.222
Come here. Good job.

41:52.223 --> 41:54.725
- All right, I'm gonna do it.
- Mm-hmm.

41:57.195 --> 41:59.179
Way to go, Cha...
