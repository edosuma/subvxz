00:02.040 --> 00:03.320
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.480 --> 00:06.280
- Someone slashed your tires?
- Was the real police busy today?

00:06.480 --> 00:09.080
- Any idea who might've done this?
- Lamar. He's my ex.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.360
Lamar Tilton?
We're investigating vandalism...

00:11.520 --> 00:14.840
...to a car owned by your ex-girlfriend.
- You mean the tires I slashed?

00:15.040 --> 00:20.720
That's my book. The reason I have it
is because Matthew has autism.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.360
That doesn't mean Vic and his guys
didn't steal drugs.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.880
- But without evidence...
- I saw them pocket cocaine.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.480
Cops here will treat you like a traitor.
You ready for that kind of heat?

00:29.640 --> 00:32.479
- I'll have to be.
- We need to keep this under control.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.960
I'll talk to my people, make sure
there are no leaks on this end.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.880
This is an IAD file of an investigation
my people are trying to cover up.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.960
- Dirty cops?
- You'll see it gets publicity.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.280
Don't worry, David. I'll make sure
they spell your name right.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.160
You have an open warrant
for your arrest. Don't worry.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.400
Your boyfriend'll lock up.
Won't you, officer?

01:00.440 --> 01:03.280
One Tango Eight in pursuit
of a white four-door...

01:03.440 --> 01:06.680
...failing to yieId traffic eastbound
on Fox Ave approaching Alden.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.280
One Tango Two,
we will be secondary in the pursuit.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.720
...asking the sergeant for permission
to tak e him out here.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.480
One Tango 13, show is in the area.
Paralleling the pursuit on Tambor.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.400
CHP is trying to get a tag strip here.
There's cross-traffic.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.240
This is very dangerous.
They've stopped.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.720
He mak es his way through that
intersection. There's traffic up ahead.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.440
He's gonna have to tak e
the wrong side of the road!

01:36.920 --> 01:38.280
Julien!

01:39.280 --> 01:41.520
Don't gun it!
Too many people!

01:41.720 --> 01:44.360
On the wrong side of the road again!
There's a vehicle!

01:44.520 --> 01:45.800
That was nearly a collision!

01:49.720 --> 01:52.920
Farmington cops investigated
for stealing drugs?

01:53.080 --> 01:56.080
The chief dunked my balls like a couple
of doughnuts in his coffee.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.440
- You have any idea how this got out?
- Yeah! You leaked it!

01:59.880 --> 02:01.760
- Me?
- You come across like a crusading...

02:01.920 --> 02:04.240
...cop bucking the system.
- We're all hurt.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.520
No one succeeds in this department
by being anti-cop.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.039
I'm anti-criminal.
Even if they're wearing a badge.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.600
I must've missed that quote
in the paper.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.440
What're you gonna do about the
Strike Team? Suspend them?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.840
- Innocent until proven guilty.
- Can't have them running the streets...

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
...with these charges pending.
- And we can't suspend officers...

02:22.160 --> 02:25.840
...without due process. Reassign
the team to the general detective pool.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.480
- Stick them with different partners.
- In the meantime, I'll see if I can...

02:29.640 --> 02:32.000
...figure out who leaked this.
- Don't bother.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.080
Do you wanna pack your things
now or would you like a few days?

02:35.240 --> 02:39.160
Firing the one cop who actually cares
about cleaning up the department.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.600
I wonder how the chief would like
that headline.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.280
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

02:53.880 --> 02:56.440
- Howdy, partner.
- Slumming with us ordinary detectives.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.720
Don't get too excited.
It's just temporary.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.400
Promises, promises.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.760
Looks like we're running
together today.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.640
- Yeah.
- There's traffic up ahead.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.880
- He's trying to get...
- Northbound, over.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.440
It's coming our way.
Block this intersection.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.480
- When we're clear, cross the street.
- Shouldn't I follow?

03:19.640 --> 03:23.480
No, you're trailing. Pull up and over.
They'll tell us when to converge.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.720 --> 03:37.320
Time to converge.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.880
What the hell am I supposed to talk
to Shane Vendrell about all day?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.440
It's good to shake things up.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.280
I don't wanna shake things up.
I want my partner back.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.160
Aren't you sweet? Well, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.120
You're gonna miss me too, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.160
I called it in.
ETA, three minutes.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.680
Back a block!

04:12.360 --> 04:13.960
Danny!

04:16.760 --> 04:18.800
- Broman, pop the trunk.
- Got it.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.880
God!

04:27.040 --> 04:29.080
Oh, God.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.080
Could've used a higher sunscreen.

04:45.520 --> 04:45.600
The story's even worse than you said.
It's all in there. We're screwed!

04:45.600 --> 04:49.440
The story's even worse than you said.
It's all in there. We're screwed!

04:49.600 --> 04:52.040
Give me till the end of the day,
this thing goes away.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.200
What're you talking about? We're
gonna have to make this thing go...

04:56.960 --> 05:00.320
- Heard you guys found a crispy critter.
- It's a miracle he's still alive.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.640
Must've had it coming. You gotta
piss somebody off to have them...

05:03.800 --> 05:07.120
...torture you and stick you in a trunk.
- Nobody deserves that.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.000
- He was probably a rat.
- Hey!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.240
- Back off!
- Cut it out!

05:11.440 --> 05:13.640
- Julien's not a rat.
- They run in packs now?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.400
- What is your problem?
- Vic!

05:16.080 --> 05:17.960
Hey!
Hey!

05:18.120 --> 05:20.000
Let's not make this
into a bigger mess.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.960
Come on.
Come on!

05:28.000 --> 05:33.360
Lay low, man. Do your work.
Leave this thing to me.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.040
Hey.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.040
Hey! I'm still here.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.400
- Julien...
- I hear you.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.960
- Well, you gotta help me out.
- Nothing I can do.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.120
- How did that cop know about us?
- I don't know.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.960
Pulled some strings.
Got you released until your court date.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.040
- You did?
- Yeah.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.520
I just need help with one thing first.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.160
I'm filling out my report,
and I'm a little confused.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.640
When I busted in, it looked like you had
some cop's dick in your mouth.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.400
That can't be right.
Can it?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.880
You got something to say,
say it to me.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.400
Okay. It's easy to make a mistake,
especially on a bust.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.720
You think you see someone pocketing
coke instead of boxes of ammo.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.480
- It can be confusing.
- He's not confused about anything.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.520
- I'm not taking back my statement.
- See?

06:40.560 --> 06:44.040
And what you're saying
that he and me did, it never happened.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.320
It never happened.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.240
What? Julien. Julien!

06:50.120 --> 06:53.640
- You heard him. It never happened.
- He needs me.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.200
- Aren't you full of yourself? It's over.
- That's not what he said.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.920
That's what I say. He's got a lot
on his mind right now.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.400
He doesn't need you
complicating things. Stay away.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.600
- You can't keep us apart.
- I've seen your sheet.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.040
Small-time con men like you
only care about themselves.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.640
Yeah, well, he cares about me.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.160
You don't want me hauling you in every
week. That's what you care about.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.720
So cut him off.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.400
Oh, man, look at this guy.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.960
I ever get that bad,
pull the plug with both hands.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.000
- Not me.
- What? You'd want that?

07:31.160 --> 07:33.280
No, but it beats the alternative.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.840
Just keep my machines juiced
until the Hoover Dam's out of business.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.200
- Detectives.
- Dr. Crawford. How's the poor sap?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.400
Third-degree burns over 60 percent
of his body. He's gonna die.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.680
Here are his things.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.560
The skin showed traces of red
phosphorus and hydrogen chloride.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.160
- He blew himself up in a meth lab.
- I'm seeing two, three of these a month.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.520
Every bozo from here to San
Bernardino thinks he can cook crank.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.040
Don't know
what you're doing, boom.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.400
Meth. Courtesy of Cupid.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.600
- How lovely.
- Meth's the drug of the day.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.800
We've got a few ODs in the ER
right now.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.680
Could you take us down there,
give us a look?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.080
- Oh, he's tweaking.
- Third one today.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.320
- Could I see the patient's belongings?
- Over here.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.040
May we see
the patient's belongings please?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.800
Thank you.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.920
- Call me if you get any more.
- I will.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.480
Cupid's busy.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.760
Looks like our mummy cooked up some
crap before blowing himself up.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.960
Let's hope he's dumb and lazy.
No telling how much he churned out.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.000
Got another college kid.

08:38.799 --> 08:42.120
- How do you want to play this?
- We both have our own ways that work.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.680
- Why don't we just take turns.
- Take turns?

08:44.840 --> 08:46.880
We follow one lead your way,
next one my way.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.320
Your way's not gonna land me
in the papers, is it?

08:49.480 --> 08:52.520
- Don't believe everything you read.
- Okay. Who goes first?

08:52.680 --> 08:55.560
- Ladies go first.
- All I know is the ID of the driver...

08:55.720 --> 08:58.400
...so let's start with his family.
- Lead the way.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.920
- David.
- Jorge.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.640
- There's no turning back, huh?
- I know I've burned some bridges.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.040
- Now's the time to build new ones.
- How so?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.560
The good news.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.840
This headline is exactly what we
needed to brand you for the voters.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.120
- It came out well.
- I've decided to back you...

09:14.280 --> 09:16.040
...for City Council.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.480
I was hoping that's what this
was about. Thank you.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.400
I would like you and Aurora to join me
for dinner tomorrow.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.880
You can meet
the rest of your team then.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.400
- I have a team?
- We have a lot of work ahead of us.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.840
The celebration on Cinco de Mayo will
make a good coming-out party for you.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.600
Jorge. I promise, I'm not in this to lose.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.160
You can't afford to.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.680
Don't believe everything
you read.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.240
You gotta wonder where they
come up with this stuff.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.440
- Anything break yet?
- No.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.680
There's a crack den on Temple
due for a toss. Want to hit it?

09:56.840 --> 10:00.680
I wish I could.
I've gotta go over some open files.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.760
Alrighty then.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.640
Danny!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
How was the sergeant's test?

10:08.800 --> 10:11.560
I don't know. It's gonna be close.
I kind of froze a little.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.080
I'll bet you did great.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.320
Listen, pass or fail, I do want
to thank you for tutoring me.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.600
- Can I buy you dinner tomorrow night?
- Sure.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.320
Great. Tomorrow night.
You pick the place.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.360
- Can I help you with that?
- Sure, yeah.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.960
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm looking for Det. Gannon.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.920
I've been leaving him messages
for the last two months.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.840
Det. Gannon retired last year.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.880
Well, he was investigating a case.
My husband was murdered.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.160
- Here, have a seat.
- Thank you.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.000
I haven't heard anything in ages.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.760
I couldn't understand
why he wasn't returning my calls.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.920
- What's your husband's name?
- Kyle Kelner.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.800
I'll pull the file.
I'll be right back.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.200
So you lost your husband.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.480
- Year ago today.
- I'm so sorry.

11:09.640 --> 11:13.200
I don't understand. I mean,
why would Andy run from the police?

11:13.360 --> 11:19.160
He had a burn victim in his trunk
and methamphetamine in his pocket.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.680
This doesn't make any sense.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.120
This is from my daughter's
rubber-stamp kit.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.560
You didn't know
your husband was involved in this?

11:27.720 --> 11:30.560
He's a web-page designer,
not a drug dealer.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.560
He and his friend Eric
have been looking for jobs...

11:33.720 --> 11:36.360
...ever since the company
they worked for had gone bust.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.320
- Who's Eric?
- They went to college together.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.200
I tried to reach him
when I saw the chase on TV...

11:43.400 --> 11:45.080
...but I can't get ahold of him.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.840
I'm afraid I might know
where to find Eric.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.640
- I can't even look at him like that.
- It was a meth-lab explosion.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.280
What?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.880
Meth lab?

11:59.360 --> 12:02.200
I knew that my brother
was having money problems.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.400
You know, but how was I supposed
to help him?

12:04.600 --> 12:09.720
He's the one who went to college.
Now they're asking me to end his life.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.640
What do I do?

12:15.320 --> 12:17.040
Thanks for standing up
for me earlier.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.760
That's what partners do.
Even if you don't agree with them.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.360
- Don't agree with them?
- Look, this is a brotherhood.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.880
Everybody knows that but you.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.960
- You don't know what I been through.
- Because you don't tell me.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.160
Decide if you wanna stay partners.
If you do, start opening up.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.440
If you don't, talk to Aceveda.
Car's clean.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.240
He turned me down when
I asked him for a new partner.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.120
Maybe he'll give you
a different answer.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.720
- Here's an unserved warrant.
- Year-old lottery ticket.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.800
Weight Watchers coupon.
Like that lard-ass would ever use it.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.080
He just dumped
his desk drawer into this box.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.680
Clock ran out on this case a year ago.
I'm not shovelling ice off the clue trail.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.480
- Well, we owe it to her.
- No, Gannon owes her.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.960
You want me to fly solo?

13:00.160 --> 13:03.480
No, man. Looks like this
is the only action I'm gonna get today.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.200
- Excuse me?
- The  I lost my husband tragically...

13:06.400 --> 13:09.200
...but I'm young, hot and in need
of an emotional release sex.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.600
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

13:12.040 --> 13:17.280
You've never covered some homicide
and gone back later for a statement?

13:18.080 --> 13:22.080
This one's been hanging on the vine
for a year, man. She is ripe.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.120
- Get out of here! She's with me now.
- Just give me two minutes, man.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.040
- She say you only last two minutes.
- As long as it takes to whup your ass.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.600
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
- Tell me, what?!

13:38.760 --> 13:41.840
- What you wanna do, then?
- Wait a minute. You guys again?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.600
Weren't you with you and we
busted you for slashing his tires?

13:45.760 --> 13:48.880
That's the past. Today you need
to be arresting him for trespassing.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.040
You gotta own something for me
to be trespassing, welfare nigga!

13:52.200 --> 13:55.840
- Man, my job is getting nasty with Fran.
- Come on, Fran, don't do this, baby.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.040
- We together now. What you want?
- Fran, give me two minutes, girl.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.840
- She's not giving you two minutes.
- Give me one minute.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.160
- We're through, Hooper.
- Fran, don't do this.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.200
- She's not giving you the time of day.
- Don't do that, Fran.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.880
- He don't deserve you, girl.
- Get on inside. Come on.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.280
Fran. Come on, now,
don't do this, baby!

14:14.360 --> 14:17.560
Finishing the marketing plan.
Has to be done before I fly to Houston.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.120
- Don't think you're getting any.
- Is that any way...

14:20.280 --> 14:23.520
...to talk to the next city councilman?
- Oh, my God. Machado said yes?

14:23.680 --> 14:26.400
We're having dinner at his house
tomorrow to meet the team.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.360
The team? Oh, David.

14:29.520 --> 14:34.080
I can't believe it.
So why aren't you more excited?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.400
This is my shot. I won't get another.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.240
You won't need another one.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.480
Power is an aphrodisiac.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.800
Died about 20 minutes ago.
Second, so far.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.120
Third one scrambled his brains,
and all from the same college.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.520
We better find this stuff, or you'll be
stacking them up in the freezer.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.920
- Ambulances bring them all in?
- All but that one.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.200
Who brought him?

14:57.680 --> 15:00.080
That guy over there.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.480
Police. You knew the OD victim?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.720
He was rushing my frat.
I'm the pledgemaster.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.600
This part of rush week?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.320
- My father's a lawyer.
- Mine was a bricklayer. So what?

15:17.800 --> 15:21.800
Fowler, Coughlin & Rose.
You wanna talk to me, talk to them.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.240
We are definitely
doing this one my way.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.920
Get the hell off me!

15:30.080 --> 15:32.800
- You want him to be your brother?
- Yeah.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.160
- Kiss your brother.
- Stop!

15:34.440 --> 15:36.200
- Where'd he get the meth?
- Please, no!

15:36.680 --> 15:38.400
- Where'd he get it?
- I don't know!

15:38.560 --> 15:40.320
Fine. Kiss your brother again.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.120
We gave it to all the pledges!

15:42.280 --> 15:45.240
It was supposed to be funny,
sending them to class on speed.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.240
- Jesus.
- Where'd he get it from?

15:47.400 --> 15:52.680
Effi. Effi Montecito.
He deals to all the frats.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.960
Good. Now let me show you
how we haze our pledges.

16:00.080 --> 16:00.200
Detective Gannon
left a long list of TBIs...

16:00.200 --> 16:04.200
Detective Gannon
left a long list of TBIs...

16:04.360 --> 16:08.320
...to be interviewed.
So we're starting from scratch.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.480
What exactly was
your husband's business?

16:11.640 --> 16:15.520
Property management.
He owned condos, rented them out.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.880
And he was found
at a construction site?

16:19.120 --> 16:22.200
Yeah, he and his partner Ari
were building a new complex.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.920
Was he meeting someone?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.960
I don't know. I...

16:27.120 --> 16:31.000
I had just gotten home from
my parents' when the police called.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.240
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.200
- I'll get you some chips.
- Thanks.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.480
Have you talked to anyone,
like a grief counsellor?

16:47.640 --> 16:48.840
Didn't help.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.640
- I know some that are very good.
- I don't know. It's already been a year.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.720
I'm sure it feels like it was yesterday
when you got that call.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.960
Our dealer Effi is a 25-year-old
still living in his old frat house.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.000
- Can't seem to grow up?
- He'll grow up fast in San Quentin.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.400
Real fast.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.160
It'll take a few hours to get the warrant.
I'll start.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.480
Not a problem.
I got some errands to run, anyway.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.839
What's going on?
This IAD thing's still hanging out there.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.920
I told you.
I'm not changing my statement.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.280
- I'm willing to keep your secret.
- Sure you are.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.560
I am. What do you think,
I'm gonna twist your arm?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.240
- All you gotta do is...
- Lie?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.640
It's not a lie. You made a mistake.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.200
We put boxes of ammo in that bag,
not bricks of coke.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.640
I know what ammo looks like, and
I know what blackmail looks like too.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.920
- It's not gonna work.
- I got nothing to lose.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.880
My guys have taken fire
from every scumbag in town.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.400
They're going down because some
rookie thinks he saw something?

17:49.560 --> 17:50.920
I did see something.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.680
I'm not gonna let you
destroy their lives.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.280
So you're gonna try and destroy mine?

17:56.440 --> 17:58.760
You're not giving me any choice.

17:58.920 --> 18:02.240
Handing in this arrest report is the
only way I can think to stop you...

18:02.400 --> 18:05.840
...from making a huge mistake.
- That report doesn't prove anything.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.760
I don't have to prove you're gay.

18:09.720 --> 18:16.000
In this house, all I gotta do is say it
with all the gory details.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.680
- There you go.
- All right.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.680
Vic!

18:48.080 --> 18:51.160
- I'm not sure they stole any drugs.
- What?

18:51.320 --> 18:54.360
It was dark. They were at the other end.
My view was obstructed.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.520
You never said your view
was obstructed.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.240
Well, it was.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.680
You didn't see Mackey put two bricks
of cocaine into a weapons bag?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.400
I can't be positive.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.440
You didn't see Shane Vendrell
drive off with that bag?

19:06.600 --> 19:09.400
- I don't know for sure what was in it.
- Mackey got to you.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.040
He threatened you.
We can get him for that too.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.880
- He didn't.
- Then what?

19:15.040 --> 19:17.360
Maybe I let his reputation
cloud my judgment.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.600
Question: Are you positive it was
two kilos of cocaine? Answer: Yes.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.400
I'm not sure anymore.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.680
Julien, failure to report corruption
and giving false testimony...

19:28.840 --> 19:32.000
...are both serious offences.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.920
I'll accept whatever
punishment I have to.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.440
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.640
- Yeah!
- I told you it would go away.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.440
- How'd you get him to back off?
- I reasoned with the man.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.560
You are my personal hero.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.440
- Get out.
- Sure. I got a big case I'm working.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.320
- What did you do to him?
- To who?

20:18.480 --> 20:20.800
- Officer Lowe.
- Nothing.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.160
- Is he okay?
- He changed his statement.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.400
IAD hasn't notified me.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.680
If anything happens to him...

20:30.840 --> 20:36.400
Can't see why it would. Listen, I gotta
run. I'm touring a school for my kid.

20:36.560 --> 20:41.480
Oh, sorry your headlines
got screwed up.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.880
- What now?
- Look at this.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.360
Hoe?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.160
Goddamn bastard called her that
for everybody to see.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.840
- How do you know Hooper did this?
- Hooper's not a very good speller.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.840
Look it over. Sign right there.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.840
So he can't come within 10 feet of me?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.720
That's a restraining order.
You can use this to justify one.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.080
- So, what if he comes near me?
- Then I make him my bitch. Now sign it.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.360
- Sometimes I see him at the Vons.
- Vons? What Vons?

21:15.520 --> 21:18.280
- Well, he helps with my shopping.
- Helps with your shopping?

21:18.440 --> 21:21.960
- Hell, no. That stops right here.
- Back off. Just let her think it through.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.760
She needs to sign the damn thing.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.400
Okay, baby.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.080
It's all good.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.240
So you were Kyle Kelner's
business partner.

21:31.400 --> 21:35.480
- Until he died.
- Where were you on the night he died?

21:35.640 --> 21:39.240
I told the detective last year.
I was in Phoenix on business.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.840
Why are you just getting around
to Kyle's murder now?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.880
Unfortunately, the file slipped through
a crack in the system.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.600
Judging from today's newspaper...

21:46.760 --> 21:49.320
...I'm surprised any crack
slips past you guys.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.360
Well, those are just allegations.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.760
Sure. Gotta stick up for your own.
I understand.

21:57.320 --> 22:01.600
He got along with everyone.
Nice, funny. A great boss, you know?

22:01.760 --> 22:06.440
Wish I could find another one like him.
Haven't had a decent job since he died.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.240
- Must be real tough on you.
- Yeah.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.040
Yeah.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.600
You know, it's times like this when
you need someone to lean on.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.800
- Like a husband or boyfriend or...
- I'm single.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.560
Our specialized care is designed to
meet the needs of autistic children...

22:24.720 --> 22:27.240
...including speech,
occupational, behaviour therapies.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.880
The facilities are really nice.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.400
One of the books I read said if
you put a kid with other autistic kids...

22:32.560 --> 22:35.520
...it keeps them from socializing.
Sort of lowering the bar.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.040
Some people think that. But we've seen
that autistic children progress...

22:39.200 --> 22:42.280
...most rapidly in a small class
with other kids their own level.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.240
How does this compare with
public schools, pilot programs?

22:45.400 --> 22:48.240
You risk Matthew being placed
in a typical class with an aide.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.040
- What's wrong with that?
- Throwing them in the deep end...

22:51.200 --> 22:54.280
...won't teach them how to swim.
Here Matthew will be a leader.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.680
He'll gain more confidence.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.040
So he won't be behind anymore.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.600
We have one spot available.
It's sure to go quickly.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.760
Twenty-five grand is pretty steep.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.600
Services we provide aren't cheap.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.680
You ask any of the parents here,
they'll tell you it's worth it.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.200
It seems wonderful.

23:09.360 --> 23:14.200
I know it's a big decision, but I suggest
you make it quickly. Excuse me.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.760
- Julien.
- Reverend. What are you doing here?

23:18.920 --> 23:22.560
Your captain called. He said you
were struggling with a decision.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.840
Some reason,
thought I might be able to help.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.120
Come on, police stations
make me nervous. I need a smoke.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.960
I went back on my statement
because I'm not sure what I saw.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.440
What made you sign it
in the first place?

23:34.600 --> 23:38.440
I don't know. Too eager to do
the right thing. I overreacted.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.280
I know an overreactor when I see one.
That's not you.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.120
What's going on, Julien?

23:46.320 --> 23:49.680
What do you do when the man that you
are isn't the man that you wanna be?

23:49.840 --> 23:53.080
Then you give the man that you are
a swift kick in the ass.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.920
What's stopping you?

23:56.760 --> 23:59.560
Nothing. I'll be all right.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.320
Only thing better than
unfiltered smoke.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.200
Unfiltered prayer. Just you and God.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.200
No secrets. Nothing in between.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.320
See you Sunday?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.040
Yeah.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.960
Okay. Come on, boys.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.640
- Let's go, ladies. Who's up?
- Are you serious about this?

24:37.680 --> 24:38.960
Hey, what's happening?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.040
- Who the hell are you?
- Decency police.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.480
- Let me guess. Effi Montecito?
- Yeah.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.480
- You're coming with us.
- What?

24:51.920 --> 24:56.560
- This one we do my way.
- If you feel we have time for that.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.720
Hey! I thought screwing sheep
went out with New Wave.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.240
We weren't really gonna make them
do it. We just wanted to see who would.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.280
Wait. You dragged my son
here for a schoolboy prank like this?

25:07.440 --> 25:09.720
Your son's here on suspicion
of drug trafficking.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.680
- What?
- Dad, it's not true.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.240
So far, three students
at Mission Cross Hospital...

25:15.400 --> 25:17.680
...have died from
your Cupid crystal meth.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.200
That wasn't mine.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.240
Apparently he supplies
half of fraternity row.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.280
We have to get this batch
off the street before more kids die.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.760
- You dealing drugs again? Goddamn it.
- Dad, they can't prove anything.

25:29.920 --> 25:35.000
You're 25 years old. Grow up,
would you? You stupid son of a bitch.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.160
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Stop!

25:37.320 --> 25:39.720
- Your stuff is killing...
- Shut up!

25:39.880 --> 25:42.000
Hey, hey, hey, that's enough!

25:45.480 --> 25:49.240
Don't you know what you're doing to
your family? Go on. Let them take you.

25:49.640 --> 25:55.880
Go on. You stupid piece of shit! You
see if I'm gonna bail you out this time.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.240
I like doing things your way.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.240
I told them to take the
life support away.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.200
Son, I don't mean to be disingenuous,
but I'm sorry.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.560
- What's disingenuous mean?
- Means you're under arrest.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.720
- For what?
- For shaking and baking crystal meth.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.840
- I don't know anything about that.
- We talked to Effi.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.800
He rolled on you, you roll on him.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.680
Eric was mixing up a batch and it
exploded and he was screaming.

26:28.840 --> 26:33.520
His flesh was...
We couldn't take him to the hospital.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.840
So you tossed him in a trunk.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Andy was gonna bury him in the desert.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.320
He was still alive.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.560
We thought that he'd die
by the time that we got there.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.120
Exactly how stupid are you?

26:45.280 --> 26:48.120
You're six credits shy of graduating
for the last four years.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.600
You're a drug dealer who spends his
time watching pledges hump sheep.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.360
- And he's the stupid one?
- Any more bad crank still out there?

26:55.520 --> 26:57.640
Only the stuff Manny's holding
for collateral.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.640
Who's Manny?

26:59.800 --> 27:02.720
He's the guy we borrowed
the money from to start the meth lab.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.720
When we couldn't pay right away,
he smashed up my hand...

27:06.880 --> 27:09.240
...and he took half of the drugs
as collateral.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.720
- How much is half?
- Ten pounds.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.360
There's still 10 pounds
of this shit out there?

27:16.640 --> 27:19.200
- Goddamn it.
- If he hadn't threatened us...

27:19.360 --> 27:22.680
...Eric wouldn't have rushed the
last batch and he would still be alive.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.840
- All right. Who is this Manny guy?
- Manny Sandoval.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.640
Manny Sandoval skated two murders
I should've had him for.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.400
I've wanted this bastard
for a year.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.640
If he's so bad,
how come I never heard of him?

27:33.800 --> 27:35.840
You know every criminal
on the street?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.880
After we catch this guy, I will.

27:38.040 --> 27:42.200
You want me to give you $20,000?
You can't be serious.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.560
That's what our meth men
owe this Manny.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.400
They're both willing to wear a wire.
Nail him at the drop.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.200
Get the bad dope out of circulation.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.320
Vic, stop. You're under investigation
for stealing drugs.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.360
- I'm supposed to give you cash?
- You're not giving it to Vic.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.480
You're giving it to me.
So we can save some lives.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.680
- When do you need it?
- Tomorrow.

28:02.840 --> 28:06.760
So long as we're clear,
I'm giving the money to you.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.400
- Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.
- Hey.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.960
I tried to call,
but the phone's disconnected.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.360
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. I just forgot to pay the bill.

28:20.520 --> 28:24.080
- But it'll be on in a couple days, so...
- No problem.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.760
I need to check on one thing,
and I'll leave.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.040
Did your husband have
business ties to Phoenix?

28:30.280 --> 28:33.840
I don't think so.
I know Ari has family there.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.080
- Your husband's partner?
- Yeah.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.640
He was visiting them the night
that Kyle was killed.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.400
Hey, I called one of those
grief counsellors you recommended.

28:43.560 --> 28:47.280
- Yeah?
- I have an appointment on Tuesday.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.560
Good. I'm glad.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.440
- Well, thank you. I'Il...
- Detective, do you have to...?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.160
Thanks for taking care of this.

29:01.160 --> 29:05.960
- Thanks.
- My pleasure. Good night.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.760
Bye.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.440
I called Reverend Cook because I was
worried. I know how tough this is.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.360
You shouldn't have done that.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.680
I don't know what Mackey did or said...

29:16.840 --> 29:20.000
...but I know it took fortitude
to come forward in the first place.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.320
- Where is that fortitude now?
- I made a mistake.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.440
Yes, you have.
And I wanna help you rectify it.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
I don't want your help.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.160
You should contact your
PBA rep, Julien.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.960
You're facing suspension,
probably termination.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.880
I wish it'd gone down a different way.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.680
We can skip the trip
to Lake Powell this year.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.760
I can go back to work at the ER,
pick up some shifts per diem.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.120
And spend half the money
you make on daycare.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.480
We'll lose that spot.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.680
Then he'll go to school in the
real world, learn how to socialize.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.440
I want him at Glenridge.
He'll be happy there, I know it.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.800
You know what? You know it too.

30:02.640 --> 30:06.760
All right. Call them tomorrow.
I'll have to pick up extra shifts.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.640
- We barely see you enough already.
- What do you want?

30:09.800 --> 30:12.400
I'm not mad. We just miss you.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.160
- Matthew ruined my notebook.
- Let me see here.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.800
You know what?
We'll get you a new one, okay?

30:20.960 --> 30:24.400
Why does he do stuff like that?
He never listens.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.720
No, Matthew listens. He just
understands things differently.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.280
Come here.

30:29.680 --> 30:34.200
You see how you make your letters so
neat? Get them to fit inside the lines?

30:34.360 --> 30:35.600
Yeah.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.000
Matthew...

30:40.640 --> 30:43.760
He doesn't know how
to make things fit.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.840
He needs help with that kind of stuff.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.640
Big sister help?

30:49.280 --> 30:54.040
Yeah. Big sister help.
Come here.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.480
Big sister help.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.840
- It'll be okay.
- It's not okay. You don't deserve this.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.400
- So much for riding that headline...
- You're more than just that headline.

31:02.560 --> 31:07.160
Not to Machado. When he hears
that the case fell apart...

31:07.320 --> 31:08.760
If he backs out, what happens?

31:08.920 --> 31:13.560
Gilroy's getting squeezed. First chance
he gets, he's gonna take it out on me.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.640
There's gotta be something you can do.

31:15.800 --> 31:20.640
I can't think of what.
I really thought this was my shot.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.480
I'm so sorry.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.520
I knew twice in one day
was too much to hope for.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.960
Shoe?

31:37.880 --> 31:41.200
- What are you doing here?
- I told you. I only needed two minutes.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.760
He bumped into me at the Vons.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.640
Who painted that S?

31:45.800 --> 31:48.800
I couldn't scrub off the hoe.
That was the next best thing.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.560
- Why are we here?
- Hey, Lamar slashed my tires again.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.000
- He gets jealous.
- I want my name white-outed...

31:55.160 --> 31:57.800
...on that restraining order,
put Lamar's name on there.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.560
- That's not gonna be a problem, is it?
- You, come with me.

32:03.800 --> 32:08.200
Hey, we hooked up
at the Vons, yo.

32:08.360 --> 32:12.520
Apparently, these guys will do anything
for you. You're leading them on.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.200
- I am not.
- Yeah, you are.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.160
Now, stop stringing them along.

32:16.320 --> 32:21.160
Just pick one and stick with him.
It's the right thing to do.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.400
Go to Phoenix often, Ari?

32:23.560 --> 32:25.400
- Sometimes.
- Who were you meeting with...

32:25.560 --> 32:28.520
...the night that Kyle was killed?
- A business acquaintance.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.320
Did you have dinner?

32:30.480 --> 32:33.640
No, I got in around 9:30. We had drinks.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.560
Did you get a chance
to see your family?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.760
Family?

32:40.400 --> 32:44.920
- No, not that trip.
- 9:30. So you were on the 8:00 flight?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.920
- Exactly.
- I checked the flight manifests.

32:48.080 --> 32:53.200
Your flight flew out at 10.
You wanna tell me something, Ari?

32:56.160 --> 32:57.840
- You did it. Say it.
- Yes. L...

32:58.000 --> 33:01.320
- Say it!
- Yes, I killed him. I didn't plan it.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.600
He found out I was stealing money
from our joint account.

33:04.760 --> 33:08.000
He accused me.
I got scared and I just killed him.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.840
I didn't have a plan,
I didn't have an alibi.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.160
Why didn't you guys
arrest me last year?

33:16.640 --> 33:21.880
Oh, that rocked. That rocked, man.
You set him up, I knocked him down.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.480
Oh, yeah. You are great.
You're great. You're great.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.920
Don't you, just once, wish
you worked for Beverly Hills P.D.?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.600
I'll bet you their wires work.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.800
You don't like the
World War II hand-me-down?

33:34.960 --> 33:36.600
You guys still owe me 20...

33:36.760 --> 33:41.400
-The lab exploded.
-Not my problem. You want the drugs...

33:41.800 --> 33:43.920
-Thirty percent...
- Damn. Did he say it?

33:44.080 --> 33:46.440
I can't hear.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.040
Your brother...

33:49.200 --> 33:53.160
-Because of you, you son of a bitch!
-Stop, you goddamn crazy... My eye!

33:53.320 --> 33:54.480
My brother'd still be...

33:56.320 --> 34:00.960
What is this? Is this a bug?
You taping me, bitch?

34:01.120 --> 34:06.040
- You taping me? I'm gonna kill you.
- Hey! Drop it! Don't make me kill you!

34:09.080 --> 34:11.800
Self-defence, man.
Crazy bastard was trying to kill me.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.480
- Shut up.
- Paul just attacked him.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.920
He just ruined everything.
I told you he's stupid.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.920
He killed Eric, okay?
He killed my brother.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.360
This doesn't screw up my deal, does it?

34:23.440 --> 34:23.560
Your informant attacks me
while working for you?

34:23.560 --> 34:25.719
Your informant attacks me
while working for you?

34:25.880 --> 34:27.679
My lawyer's gonna
buy a house off this.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.520
You were ready to kill Paul.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.679
But I didn't. And even if I did,
it was self-defence.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.280
Why don't we let a jury sort that out?

34:35.800 --> 34:38.080
Some kids croaked on meth, right?

34:38.239 --> 34:40.840
Put me behind bars,
not only won't those charges stick...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.760
...there's a good chance
the stuff gets loose on the street.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.159
- You sick bastard.
- Only when I have to be.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.480
Now, we gonna help
each other out or what?

34:53.679 --> 34:55.080
Why would Ari kill him?

34:55.239 --> 34:57.360
He was siphoning off
money from the business.

34:57.520 --> 35:01.640
Kyle caught him, hand in the cookie
jar. He was gonna blow the whistle.

35:06.440 --> 35:10.640
- Thank you, detectives.
- Don't mention it. It's our job.

35:10.800 --> 35:16.080
I'll check in on you in a few weeks,
just to make sure you're doing okay.

35:17.400 --> 35:21.360
I hope you keep that appointment.
It's a lot to take in, I know.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.200
I thought I'd be okay,
knowing what happened.

35:24.360 --> 35:29.280
Doesn't make it any better.
Doesn't change anything.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.040
He's still not gonna be there
when I get home, is he?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.400
I just don't wanna be alone anymore.

35:40.080 --> 35:44.760
Listen, Danny, I know this is short
notice, but I have to break our...

35:44.920 --> 35:48.200
- Cancel our dinner tonight.
- Everything all right?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.800
Yeah. A friend of mine's
having a crisis...

35:50.960 --> 35:53.000
- It's no problem.
- I'm really sorry.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.520
I'll just work a double.
I can use the extra cash.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.600
Great. We'll do it soon.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.480
They swept the area. Garbage cans,
dumpsters, crawl spaces. Nothing.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.640
- What about his place?
- No Cupid in sight.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.640
We've got 10 pounds of junk still out
there and he's holding all the cards.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.000
I think this might be a good time for us
to start doing things my way.

36:12.160 --> 36:16.320
- And what way would that be, exactly?
- Hey, captain. Didn't see you there.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.760
Someone should put a bell
around your neck.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.960
- Where do we stand with the meth?
- Between a rock and a hard place.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.720
Looks like we're gonna have to
do this Manny's way.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.680
The drugs were right where
you said they'd be.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.120
Lucky guess.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.600
You're welcome for the public service.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.440
Pleasure doing business
with you, detective.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.760
You picked the right day to cross paths
with me. I was handcuffed.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.720
- Man, you guys got a lot of rules.
- You know something?

36:47.880 --> 36:50.720
You might not have pulled any triggers,
but people are dead...

36:50.880 --> 36:53.200
...because of what you did.
You're on my radar now.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.640
Okay.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.360
Trust me, that's not a good thing.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.120
Just have fun tonight.
They're all dying to meet you.

37:03.360 --> 37:04.880
That's why I'm here.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.600
It kills me, Jorge,
but this whole thing fell apart.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.680
The key witness got cold feet.
The investigation's dead.

37:11.840 --> 37:14.640
I wanted you to hear it from me.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.960
It's not ideal.

37:18.440 --> 37:22.720
But it's not disaster either.
David, people remember the headlines.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.240
Most times they don't even
read past them.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.320
- This being politics...
- Perception is reality.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.920
Learning fast. Don't worry about it.
I live up to my promises.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.600
You're my man, get used to it.
I see you at 8.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.760
- How'd things go with Mackey today?
- Fine.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.040
Good.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.640
I missed you too, okay? You happy?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.280
It doesn't matter to me.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.360
How was your day?

37:53.520 --> 37:57.160
Shane wants to hit the
monster truck rally on Friday.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.040
Gotta stop meeting like this.
People are gonna talk.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.080
Not about anything they heard from me.

38:15.040 --> 38:20.960
Hey, might not feel like it,
but you did the right thing yesterday.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.880
I'm not gay.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.160
Julien, come on.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.680
I'm not.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.480
It's this thing...

38:29.640 --> 38:31.880
...inside of me.

38:32.040 --> 38:37.160
I push it down, it goes away.
But then it comes back stronger.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.080
I shove it down again,
but it just keeps on coming back...

38:40.240 --> 38:43.280
...till I don't have the strength
to push anymore.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.800
I am so weak.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.960
I hate this thing inside of me.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.120
Julien.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.040
You can't go through life
hating who you are.

39:01.200 --> 39:06.200
I pushed away everyone.
My partner, my reverend, Tomas.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.080
I'm alone.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.760
Hey, no, you're not.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.720
You were there for me.
I'm there for you.

39:22.720 --> 39:28.200
It is so nice to have someone else
cook dinner. It smells incredible.

39:28.360 --> 39:33.160
Thanks. One of the keys is basil.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.480
You have to add it
just before it's done...

39:35.640 --> 39:38.080
...otherwise you cook the flavour
out of it.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.080
- Well, we wouldn't wanna do that.
- No.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.440
Strainer?

39:51.200 --> 39:53.160
Today has been very emotional for you.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.480
There's a lot of...

39:55.920 --> 40:00.360
...delayed grief, pent-up confusion,
misplaced feelings.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.680
I'm not gonna take advantage of that.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.120
Hold me.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.120
- Hey.
- What's up?

40:18.640 --> 40:21.040
This whole IAD thing.

40:21.200 --> 40:25.960
- I shut you out. Looks like I was wrong.
- This thing confused a lot of people.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.120
Yeah, I know. Killed my partnership.

40:28.280 --> 40:31.520
It's not too late. He's a good kid.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.560
Maybe he deserves a second chance.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.000
Most of us do.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.440
- I'll see you.
- Right.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.280
- Sir.
- Danny.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.880
Strike Team's back in business,
effective tomorrow.

40:51.080 --> 40:54.000
- Did you ever have any doubt?
- I did this time.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.680
I'm tired, Vic.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.600
I just can't keep explaining these
messes or cleaning up after them.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.360
- Ben.
- No.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.280
I'm not gonna let myself get burned.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.160
We're done, Vic.

41:16.960 --> 41:20.120
I just can't have your back anymore.

41:21.800 --> 41:25.480
I thought I owed it to you to tell you.
