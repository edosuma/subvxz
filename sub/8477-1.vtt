03:16.626 --> 03:18.043
As incomplete as
the sun without rays...

03:19.001 --> 03:20.751
And fragrance without breeze...

03:21.460 --> 03:23.293
ls a ruler without
his Prime Minister.

03:24.043 --> 03:28.251
The demise of our Prime Minister,
Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath...

03:29.293 --> 03:31.168
Leaves us with a pressing question.

03:31.585 --> 03:36.543
Who here considers himself
worthy enough to be the next Peshwa?

03:38.168 --> 03:42.418
I would accept the post of Peshwa
with great honour, Your Majesty.

03:42.418 --> 03:44.085
Your proposal pleases me,
Panth Pratinidhi.

03:44.835 --> 03:47.960
Does the court approve?

03:47.960 --> 03:48.876
Your Majesty...

03:49.418 --> 03:51.585
The only man that can protect..

03:52.001 --> 03:55.835
...the Maratha empire and preserve
the honour of the Peshwa's post...

03:56.668 --> 03:57.960
is Bajirao!

04:25.335 --> 04:29.251
Forgive me, Your Majesty
but this statement mocks the court.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.960
You appear to be the
only one laughing, Minister.

04:32.626 --> 04:35.168
Every man has the
right to prove his merit.

04:35.376 --> 04:39.001
A son does not inherit his father's
wisdom simply by wearing his turban.

04:39.585 --> 04:43.626
Even a sandalwood tree needs time
to age before it produces fragrance.

04:43.626 --> 04:46.751
But even the youngest thorn can prick.
What say?

04:47.918 --> 04:52.168
Never doubt the cheetah's speed,
the hawk's vision and Bajirao's sword...

04:54.668 --> 04:56.251
They could outwit you at any moment!

04:57.960 --> 04:59.376
I, Bajirao Ballad...

05:00.168 --> 05:05.126
Son of Late Balaji Vishwanath,
consider myself fit for this post.

05:05.293 --> 05:07.960
And for that,
I am willing to pass any test.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.876
A test there shall be, Bajirao.

05:11.001 --> 05:15.126
But I shall allow Panth Pratinidhi to decide it.

05:26.876 --> 05:34.751
Prove your marksmanship by splitting
that peacock feather into two, Bajirao.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.918
Let your weapons speak of your wisdom.

05:39.751 --> 05:42.543
Now let's see some of that
cheetah's speed and hawk's vision...

06:29.335 --> 06:33.043
Your Majesty, the challenge was to
split the peacock feather into two halves...

06:33.626 --> 06:38.626
And the court witnesses that
the feather is still intact.

06:38.626 --> 06:40.293
But shorter than before.

06:41.293 --> 06:43.543
Sift through the mud and
you will find the other half there.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.710
That was proof of my marksmanship...

06:53.835 --> 06:55.043
Now for the thought behind it.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.918
That soil is India and that
peacock feather is the tree..

06:58.918 --> 07:01.418
...of the Mughal kingdom
with its roots in Delhi...

07:02.835 --> 07:04.543
The arrow is...

07:05.085 --> 07:07.168
The Maratha empire.

07:07.876 --> 07:10.668
Strike at the root and
even the biggest tree will fall.

07:11.043 --> 07:13.418
You have a brilliant mind, Peshwa!

07:40.751 --> 07:48.668
Behold the pride of
the Maratha empire...

07:49.001 --> 07:51.585
The righteous and dutiful...

07:51.585 --> 07:55.460
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad!

07:55.460 --> 07:59.168
Behold!

08:58.293 --> 09:00.585
This story belongs
to an era in history...

09:00.585 --> 09:05.793
When King Shahu Maharaj
held the reins of the Maratha empire.

09:08.793 --> 09:11.126
And his Prime Minister
was Bajirao Ballad.

09:18.210 --> 09:22.585
A sword as swift as lightening...
A will as immovable as the himalayas.

09:22.585 --> 09:27.835
The radiance of his clan on his face...
And only one dream in his eyes...

09:27.835 --> 09:32.001
To see the Maratha flag paint the
skies in Delhi, saffron with victory.

09:37.043 --> 09:42.126
In ten years, Bajirao had captured
half of India with his leadership,..

09:42.126 --> 09:45.751
...political prowess
and unmatched battle skills.

09:50.668 --> 09:53.751
Stories of Bajirao's
valour made headlines..

09:53.751 --> 09:55.835
...from the Nizam in South,
to the Mughals in the north.

09:59.668 --> 10:01.960
We shall fulfil King Shivaji's dream...

10:01.960 --> 10:05.335
...Defeat the Mughals
and make India a hindu state.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.501
Unlike the enemy's
jewels and wealth,..

10:10.501 --> 10:12.710
...our treasury is rich with blood,
ready for sacrifice.

10:16.418 --> 10:19.710
We owe our every breath
to the Maratha empire.

10:24.001 --> 10:26.543
We are the thunder
in the face of any storm...

10:26.543 --> 10:29.001
And we are a sea of
fire in the face of thunder!

10:57.001 --> 11:00.126
Bajirao Ballad shall break
away all shackles of defeat..

11:00.126 --> 11:02.668
...and unfurl the
saffron flag in victory.

11:02.668 --> 11:07.460
(War Cry)

11:52.210 --> 11:55.751
While Bajirao was weilding his sword
to change the map of India...

11:56.085 --> 11:58.793
A magnificent palace,
Shaniwar Wada,

11:58.793 --> 12:02.001
...was being constructed in Pune,
in his honour.

12:03.001 --> 12:08.043
(Chants)

12:08.335 --> 12:10.210
Kashi, where are you going in
the middle of prayers?

12:10.210 --> 12:11.126
Bhanu has come!

12:11.293 --> 12:12.001
Bhanu who?

12:12.001 --> 12:15.001
A dear childhood friend...
I'll be right back with her.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.085
Be back soon!

12:16.085 --> 12:17.460
Yes, right away.

12:21.376 --> 12:24.793
When will Kashi ever learn!

12:26.751 --> 12:28.668
Bhanu, when did you arrive?

12:28.876 --> 12:31.585
And why are you out here,
you should've come into the prayer service.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.960
That's alright.

12:33.668 --> 12:36.751
It's been a while since we last met.
All well, Kashi?

12:36.751 --> 12:39.293
Bhanu, when did this happen?

12:39.918 --> 12:41.210
What happened to your husband?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.001
He was murdered.

12:43.626 --> 12:44.668
BY Whom?

12:44.668 --> 12:45.460
By the Peshwa.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.168
Tread carefully Bhanu!

12:47.168 --> 12:48.626
You are accusing the Peshwa of murder!

12:48.626 --> 12:49.626
He was accused of being a spy...

12:49.626 --> 12:52.376
The Peshwa would
never do such injustice.

12:57.585 --> 12:58.668
What's in this?

12:59.001 --> 13:00.168
The Peshwa's justice...

13:00.168 --> 13:01.793
My husband's ashes.

13:03.085 --> 13:06.168
Today you sanctify your home...

13:06.168 --> 13:08.585
While mine burns to ashes.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.960
I ache for my husband, Kashi.

13:11.126 --> 13:13.418
As will you!

13:41.501 --> 13:44.251
My Lord, a soldier has come
from Bundelkhand.

13:44.543 --> 13:46.251
He has a message from King Chatrasal.

13:46.668 --> 13:47.918
The soldier wishes to meet you.

13:47.918 --> 13:50.126
Does the King wish to offer me
his daughter's hand?

13:51.085 --> 13:54.043
He says Mohammad Bangash's
troops have surrounded his fort...

13:54.376 --> 13:55.960
And he needs our assistance.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.793
Are we to fight our own battles
or help the king, Tukoji?

13:59.126 --> 14:00.626
We must reach Siraunja.

14:00.626 --> 14:01.585
Send the soldier away.

14:01.585 --> 14:03.543
But Sir, the soldier is insisting
on meeting the Peshwa.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.293
Tukoji, leave!

14:05.835 --> 14:06.960
Certainly.

14:08.168 --> 14:10.335
If we take this valley,
we will reach quicker.

14:10.835 --> 14:12.501
You cannot meet the Peshwa.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.585
Stop him! No one must go inside...

15:16.876 --> 15:21.168
Panth, please send
her away respectfully.

15:23.293 --> 15:24.585
Bundelkhand is in danger.

15:24.585 --> 15:27.460
The Rajput queens and princesses
are poised to self-immolate.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.751
We need your help.

15:29.751 --> 15:33.751
When Bundelkhand has a weapon
like you, what help should I be?

15:35.085 --> 15:37.293
I cannot help you right now,
please leave.

15:41.293 --> 15:43.710
You may lose your life over this!

15:43.710 --> 15:44.918
It hardly matters.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.168
I swore while leaving
Bundelkhand that..

15:48.168 --> 15:50.710
...l would return only with
Peshwa Bajirao, or not at all.

15:52.793 --> 15:55.918
I put forth a plea believing you
to be God, but you aren't even human.

16:01.668 --> 16:02.835
What is your name?

16:03.501 --> 16:04.543
Mastani.

16:06.001 --> 16:09.835
I like your courage and your approach...

16:10.418 --> 16:11.626
Decamp, Panth.

16:12.001 --> 16:13.001
We ride to Bundelkhand!

16:13.501 --> 16:15.126
But Sir,
what will we tell His Majesty?

16:15.293 --> 16:16.960
His Majesty will
be happy to know that..

16:16.960 --> 16:19.376
...one Hindu monarch
is going to help another.

16:19.793 --> 16:21.501
How far is Bundelkhand from here?

16:21.501 --> 16:22.043
It's a five day march.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.751
We shall get there in two...
- That's impossible.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.376
Let the enemy think that way...

16:26.501 --> 16:29.376
Bajirao's fame is carried
by his speed, Mastani...

16:31.293 --> 16:32.418
Let's go!

17:32.418 --> 17:34.001
Final warning...

17:34.001 --> 17:42.460
"...surrender by daybreak or face
dire consequences" - Mohammad Bangash.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.960
No word of help from the Peshwa.

17:46.793 --> 17:49.168
That leaves us only two choices...

17:49.335 --> 17:52.376
Surrender or martyrdom!

17:52.376 --> 17:54.251
MARTYRDOM!!

18:02.793 --> 18:04.835
Ruhani Begum! What's going on?

18:05.793 --> 18:10.376
My king, if enemy
breaches the fort walls...

18:10.376 --> 18:14.168
The women shall surrender to
this fire, to safeguard our dignity!

18:14.335 --> 18:16.168
My king!

18:16.335 --> 18:18.585
I see torchlights
coming in from the East!!

18:18.585 --> 18:21.418
That must be Mastani
arriving with help.

18:51.168 --> 18:55.001
General! An army approaches
from beyond those hills.

18:59.626 --> 19:01.585
Swerve the cannons!

19:14.418 --> 19:18.376
We've been tricked! About-face...
Head back!

19:18.376 --> 19:21.835
There is no army here...
It's just cattle!

19:27.335 --> 19:28.585
We have managed to trick them!

19:28.585 --> 19:30.210
Their cannons have been swerved.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.793
Mastani, reach inside the fort through
the secret tunnel...

19:33.793 --> 19:35.668
And signal me once inside.

19:36.501 --> 19:39.543
We'll be ready for attack.

20:06.418 --> 20:07.126
Mastani!

20:07.293 --> 20:08.751
The Maratha army is here, father.

20:08.751 --> 20:12.210
Bundelkhand is forever indebted to you...
- There is no debt in duty, father.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.293
Go ahead and declare war,
I'll signal the Peshwa.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.751
(War Cry)

21:37.376 --> 21:40.001
Attack!

25:25.293 --> 25:27.126
Congratulations on
your victory, Peshwa.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.418
I wish you and Mastani the same.
How is she now?

25:30.418 --> 25:32.960
Wounded, yet grateful.

25:33.293 --> 25:36.501
I don't know how
I can repay this debt.

25:36.501 --> 25:40.501
I seek no reward, dear King...

25:42.293 --> 25:46.918
All I ask for, is the permission to
bid farewell. I must reach Siraunja.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.001
I won't hear of it!

25:49.001 --> 25:51.585
You must celebrate this Holi
(festival of colours) with us!

25:53.293 --> 25:55.460
My lady, it appears you've truly
been playing Holi

25:55.460 --> 25:58.043
And with none
other than the Peshwa.

25:59.126 --> 26:02.335
He carried you here in his arms,
wounded and unconscious...

26:02.335 --> 26:06.293
But even in that state you were
entwined with him as though one body.

26:07.001 --> 26:09.043
Congratulations on this
victorious morning, My Lady.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.585
I would like a few moments alone
with Mastani Saheba.

26:11.585 --> 26:12.501
Leave us...

26:12.501 --> 26:15.668
These are my personal chambers,
Peshwa... Not your battleground.

26:16.293 --> 26:18.710
One needs my permission to leave.

26:20.626 --> 26:25.626
I said... No one leaves without
my permission.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.418
Besides, it could be dangerous being
alone with you.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.335
Is that so!
Do you not trust me, My Lady?

26:31.335 --> 26:32.876
I'm afraid it's myself I don't trust.

26:32.876 --> 26:36.418
My Rajput blood could make me
avenge your assault.

26:36.418 --> 26:37.793
You have every right.

26:38.168 --> 26:39.710
I owe you my life.

26:39.710 --> 26:41.168
I owe you my homeland.

26:41.335 --> 26:43.793
I would give even
my life for you, Mastani.

26:45.418 --> 26:47.835
It appears this account must be
settled in private after all!

26:57.543 --> 26:59.460
You deserve to be praised,
Mastani Saheba...

27:00.960 --> 27:04.418
My sword has never spared
a foe on the battlefield,"

27:04.418 --> 27:06.251
...but somehow you escaped its wrath.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.918
I believe your wound is deep.

27:10.751 --> 27:12.460
Let me see it.

27:12.835 --> 27:15.460
Rajputs do not make
a show of their wounds.

27:25.085 --> 27:27.668
To others,
this may be a battle scar...

27:28.793 --> 27:31.626
But for me,
you are the moon bathed in color.

27:40.668 --> 27:43.168
The poison had to be
stopped from spreading.

27:44.210 --> 27:46.876
I've seen your wounds, Mastani...

27:47.460 --> 27:49.876
You are no longer a Rajput.

27:52.793 --> 27:56.001
What you see is merely
the mark of your sword.

27:58.001 --> 28:00.626
But it is my heart that bleeds.

28:03.751 --> 28:05.960
Even the Peshwa has a heart!

29:09.751 --> 29:15.418
" On this festival of colours "

29:15.418 --> 29:19.585
Paint me red in the color of love.

29:19.585 --> 29:26.251
Oh you playful one,
like Lord Krishna.

29:31.876 --> 29:37.376
I'm mesmerised looking at you...

29:45.335 --> 29:50.835
Hold me close,
instead of looking from afar...

30:37.001 --> 30:42.626
Playfully you twist my arm...

30:42.626 --> 30:46.501
Like Lord Krishna with Radha.

30:57.585 --> 31:01.710
And when I protest, you embrace me...

31:01.710 --> 31:07.168
You refuse to let go of me...

31:15.418 --> 31:20.793
" Blushing I turn red...
The color of love. "

32:22.335 --> 32:27.626
Fortune favours the brave, My Lady...
And fortunate you are, indeed!

32:28.460 --> 32:30.918
The Peshwa has asked for
a paan (after meal delicacy).

32:30.918 --> 32:33.168
Here, it is your excuse to see him.

32:33.335 --> 32:34.876
I no longer need excuses.

32:36.418 --> 32:37.918
This dagger?

32:38.751 --> 32:39.835
The Peshwa gave it to me!

32:39.835 --> 32:41.585
Dear God! And you accepted it?

32:42.001 --> 32:44.501
Don't you know that as per
the custom in Bundelkhand...

32:44.501 --> 32:47.835
A girl is married to
a man by accepting his dagger!

32:48.918 --> 32:51.418
Did you accept it?

32:52.793 --> 32:54.085
I accepted it.

32:54.085 --> 32:55.501
And he?

33:19.085 --> 33:20.001
Your paan.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.501
And if I weren't awake?

33:24.960 --> 33:26.668
I would will the night
to go on for eternity...

33:27.668 --> 33:29.168
And gaze upon you forever.

33:29.168 --> 33:30.876
But that is impossible.

33:31.460 --> 33:34.210
Time and destiny cannot
be controlled by mortals.

33:34.210 --> 33:38.293
What cannot be controlled by mortals
can be swayed by the power of love.

33:38.293 --> 33:41.626
So can love stop the sun from rising?

33:59.626 --> 34:00.793
It just did.

34:02.876 --> 34:06.251
Do have your paan,
or my hospitality might be questioned.

34:08.126 --> 34:10.335
Mastani, I shall be gone tomorrow.

34:10.793 --> 34:11.668
What of it?

34:12.168 --> 34:14.168
Perhaps we may never meet again.

34:15.168 --> 34:17.751
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

34:20.043 --> 34:22.418
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

34:58.668 --> 35:00.751
My Lady, the Peshwa is leaving!

35:01.043 --> 35:04.876
Entire Bundelkhand has gathered for
his farewell, except you.

35:05.168 --> 35:06.293
Come, My Lady!

35:07.876 --> 35:09.918
Such arrogance does
not become you, My Lady.

35:10.376 --> 35:13.168
You mistake love for arrogance.

35:13.335 --> 35:15.335
What sort of love is this?
He is leaving, and you...

35:15.335 --> 35:18.876
Watching him go will
be the death of me.

35:18.876 --> 35:21.751
God forbid! But this meeting
will be left incomplete.

35:21.751 --> 35:24.751
An incomplete meeting leaves
the promise of another.

35:25.001 --> 35:27.835
And what if destiny doesn't allow it?

35:30.293 --> 35:32.960
Mastani writes her own destiny.

35:57.043 --> 36:00.126
We may be greatly
indebted to the Peshwa...

36:00.585 --> 36:03.835
But I refuse to send our daughter
to Pune as an obligation, My King.

36:04.335 --> 36:07.460
I understand that our marriage
has never been valid in the society...

36:07.460 --> 36:09.001
Because I am
Muslim and you're Hindu.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.876
It is my own decision to go to Pune...

36:11.960 --> 36:14.210
I am wed to the Peshwa's dagger.

36:14.210 --> 36:17.960
This is a custom in Bundelkhand,
not Pune.

36:18.376 --> 36:22.543
And do not forget that the Peshwa
is Hindu Brahmin and you are Muslim.

36:22.543 --> 36:25.376
Mastani has Hindu Rajput blood too.

36:26.210 --> 36:29.126
She worships Allah and Krishna alike.

36:29.460 --> 36:32.126
Jodha and Akbar put aside religious
differences in the name of politics.

36:32.126 --> 36:34.376
Mastani is doing the same,
but for love.

36:35.001 --> 36:36.376
Let her go.

36:36.376 --> 36:39.126
Even so! He will never accept
her as his legitimate wife.

36:39.293 --> 36:41.043
Radha was never Lord Krishna's wife...

36:41.501 --> 36:43.876
But their names are inseparable.

36:44.501 --> 36:45.710
Yes, but they are Gods!

36:45.710 --> 36:47.168
And love is worship...

36:48.376 --> 36:51.001
For which one needs no permission.

36:57.751 --> 36:59.793
May God fulfill your wishes!

37:03.043 --> 37:04.751
Stay blessed!

37:31.501 --> 37:35.918
My beautiful love has returned...

39:38.918 --> 39:40.043
Praise the Lord!

39:55.960 --> 39:57.251
A moment, My Lady...

39:57.418 --> 39:59.168
You have not taken my
name this time. (Marathi tradition)

39:59.168 --> 40:00.126
Why, brother!

40:00.126 --> 40:01.668
It's a new era!
New palace, new customs.

40:01.668 --> 40:03.626
Why must the lady always
take the man's name?

40:03.626 --> 40:08.710
You take her name this time,
or else no entering your new chambers!

40:08.710 --> 40:12.168
But it is a custom for women
to say their husbands' name...

40:16.293 --> 40:20.335
No diamond can match the Kohinoor's
sparkle and grace.

40:20.335 --> 40:24.293
And no name but Bajirao's
lights up Kashi's face.

40:24.751 --> 40:27.293
Very good!

40:30.085 --> 40:31.626
This way, Peshwa Saheb.

40:31.626 --> 40:33.001
My Lady...

40:33.001 --> 40:34.835
You are entering your new chambers
for the first time.

40:34.835 --> 40:35.793
What childishness is this!

40:37.001 --> 40:38.668
You swore on me...

40:38.668 --> 40:41.793
So don't open
your eyes until I say so!

40:42.918 --> 40:44.085
Don't you trust me?

40:44.085 --> 40:46.251
Trust a warrior?

40:46.543 --> 40:48.460
You never know when he may attack!

40:49.210 --> 40:51.126
Now, open your eyes.

40:51.501 --> 40:52.293
What do you think?

40:52.710 --> 40:53.751
Beautiful!!

40:55.543 --> 41:00.251
This is nothing compared to the
rest of Shanivaar Wada.

41:08.918 --> 41:11.001
Tell me something, My Lady...

41:11.501 --> 41:12.501
What?

41:13.043 --> 41:16.293
How come I still see it in your eyes?

41:16.835 --> 41:17.501
What?

41:17.501 --> 41:18.585
Longing!

41:18.585 --> 41:22.960
Because it keeps me company
in your long absences.

41:23.585 --> 41:25.501
Oh dear... Where is it?

41:26.043 --> 41:26.876
What?

41:26.876 --> 41:28.960
Your mistress!!

41:28.960 --> 41:30.751
Your dagger?

41:32.001 --> 41:33.543
Just as well you've forgotten it.

41:33.918 --> 41:35.626
It will no longer come between us.

41:40.043 --> 41:43.501
Have I offended you by
calling your dagger a mistress?

41:45.043 --> 41:47.418
I talk too much!

41:50.918 --> 41:53.585
King Chatrasaal has
showered us with gifts.

41:55.418 --> 41:56.543
I am pleased!

41:56.543 --> 41:58.876
The timing couldn't have been better...

41:59.876 --> 42:02.543
Expenses had been piling up.

42:02.918 --> 42:05.918
So helping Bundelkhand
has proved profitable for us.

42:07.876 --> 42:08.876
What is this?

42:34.835 --> 42:37.460
Who are you?

42:37.918 --> 42:39.793
This is King Chatrasaal's daughter.

42:39.793 --> 42:43.293
I wasn't aware he had
such a beautiful daughter.

42:44.001 --> 42:45.876
I 'm very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

42:46.293 --> 42:47.918
As am I, thank you!

42:48.293 --> 42:49.460
What is your name?

42:50.085 --> 42:50.960
Mastani.

42:51.293 --> 42:53.335
Mastani... Beautiful name.

42:54.585 --> 42:58.335
Your father has many wives,
whose daughter are you?

43:01.168 --> 43:02.501
Ruhani Begum's.

43:03.543 --> 43:04.876
I see, you are a Muslim.

43:05.043 --> 43:08.918
King Chatrasaal needn't
have sent his daughter..

43:08.918 --> 43:12.001
...all the way here
simply to deliver gifts!

43:12.626 --> 43:14.751
What say, Chimaji?

43:21.210 --> 43:22.960
This dagger belongs to Bajirao!

43:23.168 --> 43:27.918
In Bundelkhand we observe a custom
where girls are wed to daggers.

43:30.376 --> 43:34.543
Perhaps amongst Muslims and Rajputs.

43:34.543 --> 43:38.043
In the Peshwa regime, we do not
accept such political ties.

43:38.043 --> 43:40.001
But I am already married to him!

43:43.085 --> 43:46.460
Chimaji, please make arrangements
for her stay elsewhere.

43:46.668 --> 43:50.918
Do meet me before you
return to Bundelkhand.

44:00.210 --> 44:02.126
My dear...

44:02.335 --> 44:04.626
If you stare any longer,
you will cast an evil eye on me.

44:04.626 --> 44:07.335
I am trying to remove it.

45:45.293 --> 45:46.543
Going to war?

45:46.751 --> 45:48.001
I have decided...

45:48.335 --> 45:50.793
Next time,
I shall accompany you to war.

45:51.001 --> 45:52.501
No matter what anyone says.

45:53.626 --> 45:56.293
But you cannot ride a horse.
How do you expect to come?

45:56.293 --> 46:00.293
I'll go to the stable, mount my horse,
crack the whip...

46:00.293 --> 46:02.751
And be off like the wind.
Here comes Kashi!!

46:13.001 --> 46:15.543
We haven't even reached the
battlefield yet and you've started.

46:15.543 --> 46:17.835
What else does this warrior need?

46:18.501 --> 46:22.626
A bit of land, two square meals, a
piece of open sky, a steed, a sword...

46:22.626 --> 46:23.835
And my Kashi.

46:24.293 --> 46:26.210
Altogether, twenty-seven.

46:26.210 --> 46:27.126
How so?

46:27.418 --> 46:28.918
Twenty-seven wounds!

46:29.668 --> 46:33.626
And this time you let
the enemy get too close...

46:34.043 --> 46:35.793
And now to avoid the
twenty-eighth wound...

46:36.210 --> 46:40.668
This ring will protect
you from both the evil eye..

46:40.668 --> 46:42.918
And the enemy's sword.

46:49.710 --> 46:53.085
My Lady, I do not trust
the intentions of those people.

46:53.710 --> 46:56.001
These are no guests' chambers!

46:56.293 --> 46:58.501
It's a strategy to demean you.

46:59.293 --> 47:01.126
If they can put you
up amonst courtesans,..

47:01.126 --> 47:02.710
...they can ask you to
dance at their court next!

47:04.001 --> 47:04.960
My Lady!

47:06.793 --> 47:09.251
Well, well...
Look at the butterfly!

47:11.168 --> 47:15.001
My lady, it was unwise
to send our soldiers home.

47:15.835 --> 47:17.960
We are in a strange land,
surrounded by strangers.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.460
You never know what
problems might arise.

47:20.168 --> 47:24.251
What kind of people would house
a guest amongst courtesans.

47:24.585 --> 47:26.501
And that too the daughter
of King Chatrasaal.

47:26.793 --> 47:29.335
Swords would be raised in Bundelkhand
if they caught wind of this.

47:29.626 --> 47:31.751
Yet you sit here silently...

48:08.335 --> 48:10.585
I know you feel humiliated, My Lady.

48:12.918 --> 48:15.876
Let us return home rather
than be insulted here.

48:16.293 --> 48:18.960
If he truly loves you, the Peshwa
will come after you, to Bundelkhand.

48:19.960 --> 48:23.126
One more thing,
no matter your efforts...

48:23.543 --> 48:27.126
They will never
let him learn you are here.

48:28.460 --> 48:31.668
And I will never let
them forget my love for him.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.126
My Lord, you are now witnessing the
most beautiful section of Shanivaar Wada...

48:42.293 --> 48:43.335
The Palace of Mirrors.

48:43.585 --> 48:44.543
Whoa, Chimaji...

48:45.876 --> 48:47.043
It's unreal!

48:47.918 --> 48:50.543
While you have been busy fighting
our enemies for years...

48:50.543 --> 48:52.043
Your brother
has been building this.

48:52.335 --> 48:55.043
Chimaji, you have brought
the Taj Mahal to Pune.

48:55.043 --> 48:58.626
And you shall witness the true
splendour of this place tonight...

48:58.626 --> 49:00.168
When we celebrate the New Year.

49:00.168 --> 49:02.501
Truly this is a dreamworld, brother.

49:02.751 --> 49:06.376
The true magic of this dreamworld
lies in the wonder at your feet.

49:07.126 --> 49:07.960
How do you mean?

49:07.960 --> 49:10.085
At this very moment Bajirao,
if Kashi desires..

49:10.085 --> 49:11.960
...she can see you and
Nana from her chambers.

49:12.376 --> 49:15.960
Are you saying Kashi can see both father
and son from the comfort of her room?

49:15.960 --> 49:17.126
Therein lies the magic!

49:17.126 --> 49:18.876
That lotus has a
mechanism that makes..

49:18.876 --> 49:20.960
...your reflection shine
from these mirrors...

49:21.168 --> 49:24.626
Straight onto the
little window in Kashi's room.

49:24.626 --> 49:26.293
My Lady!!

49:27.001 --> 49:30.501
There's a beam coming
through the window.

49:30.501 --> 49:31.376
Really!

49:31.376 --> 49:34.960
Yes, really, come on, come quickly!

49:43.418 --> 49:45.876
Then traveling through
the glass on the water,..

49:45.876 --> 49:48.001
...it reflects onto the
curtain in her chambers.

49:52.126 --> 49:54.751
Quickly, My Lady, quickly!

49:54.751 --> 49:57.251
Wait a moment!

50:01.168 --> 50:04.751
Oh! We can see Bajirao here although
he's in the Palace of Mirrors.

50:04.751 --> 50:06.043
It's magic!

50:06.043 --> 50:10.085
Just look at how
handsome our Bajirao is.

50:10.876 --> 50:13.293
Hey! Stop casting the evil eye on him.

50:13.501 --> 50:15.335
A sister can never cast
an evil eye on her brother.

50:15.626 --> 50:18.751
But I've heard the Nawab's wives yearn
to set eyes on him.

50:18.751 --> 50:22.126
I've heard they would gladly pay his
weight in gold for a glimpse of him.

50:22.126 --> 50:24.960
Let them pay his weight in diamonds
if they want...

50:24.960 --> 50:28.001
My Bajirao has never
so much as looked at another woman.

50:28.585 --> 50:30.001
Understood!

50:38.501 --> 50:42.668
Like an angel descended from heaven...

50:42.918 --> 50:45.960
Her tresses exuding
a divine fragrance...

50:46.335 --> 50:50.460
Here she comes...

51:18.085 --> 51:25.043
Here she comes... A vision in gold.

51:44.501 --> 51:50.710
I am intoxicated by your love

52:08.293 --> 52:14.626
My love is no secret

52:14.626 --> 52:23.168
The world tried to stop me,
but look where love brought me...

52:23.376 --> 52:29.960
They say Mastani is
intoxicated by your love...

53:35.501 --> 53:41.501
First, you wounded my heart...

53:47.335 --> 53:53.501
Then, you healed it with your love...

53:59.626 --> 54:05.251
" Your love has become my identity..."

54:13.960 --> 54:20.293
And loving you is my purpose.

54:59.293 --> 55:02.501
Every corner is illuminated
by your beauty...

55:11.751 --> 55:14.793
You are indeed intoxicated by love,
Mastani...

55:14.793 --> 55:17.668
Your soul is pure and your love,
divine...

56:22.376 --> 56:26.460
You have been aptly named Mastani,
one who dances to her own tune.

56:27.876 --> 56:31.585
I'm surprised but happy
to see you here in Pune.

56:32.918 --> 56:36.793
This paan...
A token of my hospitality.

56:45.460 --> 56:47.960
We shall meet tomorrow.

57:30.710 --> 57:34.335
Your capabilities greatly
exceed my expectations.

57:35.043 --> 57:36.626
You are a talented dancer.

57:37.210 --> 57:38.585
Thank you.

57:38.835 --> 57:42.418
Please pay me a further compliment,
accept my alliance.

57:43.043 --> 57:44.876
Of course I have.

57:50.501 --> 57:53.543
You are now allied with the kingdom
as a court dancer.

57:54.168 --> 57:58.001
Very soon you will dance at
the king's court in the capital.

57:58.460 --> 58:01.293
Do you not like my offering?

58:01.293 --> 58:06.168
I cherish your every offering,
be it an anklet or a son...

58:06.501 --> 58:10.960
The more you try to distance him
from me, the closer I shall get to him.

58:10.960 --> 58:13.043
Then keep trying endlessly.

58:13.876 --> 58:19.710
A dancer's place is always below
the throne, on the court's floor.

58:21.043 --> 58:25.335
I have always been
complimented on my beauty...

58:26.418 --> 58:28.126
Today watching a woman of..

58:28.793 --> 58:32.168
...your standing
threatened by it, makes me proud.

58:34.835 --> 58:37.543
Prepare to leave for the Capital.

58:43.293 --> 58:45.710
It appears no one has sobered from
last night's performance.

58:45.876 --> 58:48.960
Look around,
not a soul wishes to work!

58:48.960 --> 58:53.043
What is a warrior before whom a beauty
is not compelled to lower her gaze...

58:53.501 --> 58:56.751
What is a beauty before whom a warrior
is not compelled to lower his sword?

58:56.751 --> 58:59.918
Bravo, Peshwa!... Well said!

59:00.085 --> 59:04.751
The brave Chimaji is here!

59:05.001 --> 59:08.001
Chimaji your presence indicates
our campaigns have been audited.

59:08.001 --> 59:10.001
What is the outcome?

59:10.001 --> 59:12.543
Discounting endowments
from Bundelkhand,..

59:12.543 --> 59:15.751
...none of the three campaigns
have enriched our treasury.

59:15.751 --> 59:17.793
This is where you are wrong, brother.

59:18.293 --> 59:19.918
How have we not been enriched?

59:19.918 --> 59:23.418
First - the glory of victory.

59:26.001 --> 59:28.918
Second - shaming Bangash with defeat.

59:29.293 --> 59:32.460
Third - tolling the
Maratha bell in Delhi.

59:34.543 --> 59:38.668
Fourth - the saffron flag once again
stands strong against the blue sky.

59:38.668 --> 59:42.960
Praise the lord!

59:42.960 --> 59:46.626
And fifth - a lifetime's
bond with Bundelkhand.

59:46.626 --> 59:49.710
And sixth, My Lord, you forget!

59:49.710 --> 59:53.710
A splendid dancer like
Mastani to entertain us!

01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:06.751
Chimaji, see to it our hospitality towards
Mastani Saheba is in no way lacking.

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:09.085
Of course... Rest assured I will.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.126
She's lodged at Hirabagh Palace.

01:00:11.126 --> 01:00:13.251
Send a messenger to tell her
I shall visit this evening.

01:00:16.293 --> 01:00:17.168
That won't be possible.

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:18.126
Why?

01:00:18.293 --> 01:00:19.918
Because you must leave for
the capital today, My Lord.

01:00:19.918 --> 01:00:21.376
I can do that tomorrow.

01:00:21.376 --> 01:00:24.626
His Majesty awaits you, you
must present yourself there on time.

01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:26.751
You... Fool!

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:29.918
Reign in your tongue... Understood?

01:00:33.335 --> 01:00:36.960
To the capital!

01:00:49.168 --> 01:00:50.626
Welcome, Bajirao.

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:52.626
You were impatiently awaited.

01:00:52.626 --> 01:00:55.293
You summoned and here I am,
Your Majesty.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:58.668
Congratulations on Bundelkhand!

01:00:59.543 --> 01:01:03.793
I had this sword of Afghan iron
forged in your honour.

01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:05.960
I am honoured.

01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:12.460
My King, now permit me to use this sword
to bring Delhi to its knees before you.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.043
This is not the right time to attack
Delhi, politically speaking -

01:01:15.043 --> 01:01:18.335
My instincts say now is the time,
your Majesty.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:21.126
Delhi is submerged
in a haze of debauchery.

01:01:21.293 --> 01:01:23.293
The Mughal emperor's
court has lost his faith.

01:01:23.293 --> 01:01:27.251
We have to appease the Nizam in the
South, to get to Delhi, in the north.

01:01:27.543 --> 01:01:29.335
There is such a thing
as political diplomacy.

01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:33.501
Minister has a point, Peshwa.

01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:35.918
That step must be taken
after much forethought.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:39.501
We shall discuss other matters
after this evening's soirée.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.376
This sword is best
left in its sheath, Peshwa.

01:01:48.918 --> 01:01:51.918
Since you won't be going to Delhi,
what enemy's neck would you place it on?

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.001
The Peshwa doesn't lack enemies.

01:01:56.001 --> 01:01:57.793
Don't move.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:00.335
Your neck is very valuable,..

01:02:00.335 --> 01:02:02.918
...and more delicate than
this string of pearls around it.

01:02:17.793 --> 01:02:20.001
As you already know...
Never doubt the cheetah's speed,..

01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:21.751
...the hawk's vision
and Bajirao's sword...

01:02:22.626 --> 01:02:23.960
They can outwit you any time.

01:02:38.501 --> 01:02:40.293
Why is Mastani Saheba here?

01:02:40.585 --> 01:02:43.501
Your mother has sent her
as tonight's entertainment.

01:02:50.543 --> 01:02:51.876
Let the entertainment begin.

01:02:59.835 --> 01:03:02.543
You are a court dancer,
here to entertain.

01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:04.376
Instead you are
dishonouring the court.

01:03:04.876 --> 01:03:07.376
I am not dishonouring the court,
but upholding my own honour.

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:08.460
Who are you?

01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:11.293
Mastani.

01:03:11.293 --> 01:03:13.251
She is a gift from Bundelkhand.

01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:17.626
She lit up the Peshwa's palace
with her performance during New Year.

01:03:17.626 --> 01:03:19.418
That was a valid occasion...

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:21.251
This is but a soirée.

01:03:21.585 --> 01:03:24.376
She is no court dancer but King..

01:03:24.376 --> 01:03:26.418
...Chatrasaal's daughter
and a guest of the Peshwa realm.

01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:29.668
A rather special guest, it appears.

01:03:29.876 --> 01:03:31.418
Yes she is, Minister!

01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:33.585
Thanks to her the Peshwa is alive..

01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:36.585
...and thanks to the Peshwa
the Maratha realm is alive!

01:03:38.293 --> 01:03:39.335
Your Majesty...

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.043
She does not belong in this court.
Allow her to leave.

01:03:43.668 --> 01:03:44.960
The Peshwa is right.

01:03:45.376 --> 01:03:47.001
You have saved his life...

01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.585
How can I repay you?

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.960
You will not be able to
fulfill my wish, Your Majesty.

01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:55.501
What wish is this,
that a king cannot fulfill?

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.835
The Peshwa!

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:12.293
I salute your courage in asking for
what the Maratha kingdom values most.

01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:16.543
But you could be
punished for this demand.

01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:25.085
I lay my life, at the sword of thee.
If love is a crime, punish me!

01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:34.501
And yet, if thee hold me wrong,
Erase my name like an untold song.

01:04:35.168 --> 01:04:36.418
Well spoken!

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:39.751
You may leave, Mastani.

01:05:00.293 --> 01:05:03.210
Don't anchor the boat,
I need to cross the river!

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.793
My Lord, the water levels
have risen alarmingly.

01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:09.960
I'd have to bear huge losses in taking
the boat out in this weather!!

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.960
That should suffice.

01:05:42.793 --> 01:05:46.418
Looks like the storm won't abate,
My Lady. Let's return to Bundelkhand.

01:05:46.418 --> 01:05:48.460
Our coming here has been in vain.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.710
In Pune, they kept
us amongst courtesans...

01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:56.043
And here in the capital,
across the river, amongst these ruins!

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.418
It frightens me to think...

01:05:58.418 --> 01:06:02.085
The man whose dagger you wed
is unaware of this tradition.

01:06:02.835 --> 01:06:06.168
What if he refuses to
accept your relationship?

01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:10.043
Let me test the power of my love.

01:06:10.335 --> 01:06:13.001
You needn't... Anymore!

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.418
You had demanded the Peshwa
before the whole court...

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:17.876
Here he is!

01:06:22.626 --> 01:06:25.001
I must say...

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:29.251
You have sacrificed everything
over a marriage I was not even aware of!

01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:32.043
What justifies this madness?

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960
Love...

01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:38.876
That battles stormy waters.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:43.668
Love, that bows down before no one.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:48.251
Love, that worships
its beloved above all else.

01:06:50.751 --> 01:06:54.293
This society will never accept you!

01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:57.835
Loving me will be like
walking on hot embers.

01:06:58.751 --> 01:06:59.835
I accept.

01:06:59.835 --> 01:07:02.085
My wife's name is Kashi.

01:07:02.751 --> 01:07:05.126
She will always be my first wife.

01:07:05.126 --> 01:07:07.293
I can never belong only to you.

01:07:08.626 --> 01:07:10.543
I accept.

01:07:10.543 --> 01:07:14.793
Insisting on adding my name to yours
will bring you nothing but shame.

01:07:15.668 --> 01:07:17.168
I accept.

01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:30.751
By the fire of the earth, the sky and
my being, I take you to be my wife.

01:07:31.543 --> 01:07:34.793
Even if this society shuns us,
the world will always remember us as one...

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.043
Bajirao Mastani

01:07:55.793 --> 01:07:58.793
Mapping out your
meeting with the Nizam?

01:08:00.335 --> 01:08:02.960
Ensure you wear this when you go.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:08.043
Bajirao, this ring has cost us dearly.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.585
We have paid for it twice.

01:08:11.293 --> 01:08:15.585
First to the jeweller
and then to the boatman.

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:34.960
My Lord, the snake seems
prepared to strike us.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.085
The Nizam comes with
twenty-thousand soldiers.

01:08:38.376 --> 01:08:40.335
We are heavily outnumbered.

01:08:40.335 --> 01:08:43.376
But he doesn't know that.

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:49.376
Not all battles are
fought with weapons...

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:54.001
Sometimes a sharp mind is enough.

01:09:04.085 --> 01:09:06.126
Welcome, King Bajirao!

01:09:06.126 --> 01:09:08.417
Have a seat!

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:09.792
Namaste!

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:15.542
You mistake me for royalty when I am
but a humble servant to King Shahu.

01:09:15.876 --> 01:09:20.335
Perhaps... But it is well known,
you are the mind that runs the empire.

01:09:21.042 --> 01:09:23.376
Some sherbet?

01:09:23.585 --> 01:09:24.626
Thank you.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.085
I am more interested
in your sweet talk.

01:09:27.085 --> 01:09:31.417
I often tell people that
in the Maratha empire...

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.001
After the great King
Shivaji and King Shambhu...

01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:39.585
There is only Bajirao...
Rest are all fools!

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:44.501
I'm also of the opinion that Nizam is
the strongest in all of South...

01:09:45.001 --> 01:09:46.876
Rest are all weak and meek!

01:09:46.876 --> 01:09:52.751
I'm impressed...
Your tongue is as sharp as your sword.

01:09:52.917 --> 01:09:54.960
And your intentions
are as shrewd as your eyes.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.085
My intention is to capture you.

01:09:58.085 --> 01:10:00.668
Even the youngest
child in Pune knows that.

01:10:00.668 --> 01:10:02.793
Yet here you are a willing hostage.

01:10:02.793 --> 01:10:08.001
I am under oath to retaliate if
you breach the terms of this meeting.

01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:12.418
Are you threatening
me under my own roof?

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:14.335
Cautioning, not threatening...

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.293
One wrong turn
and your kingdom will burn.

01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:20.376
Arrest him!

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:26.251
I said, arrest him!

01:10:26.876 --> 01:10:29.960
I'm amazed you would order my
own men to capture me!

01:10:30.585 --> 01:10:32.918
The men you sent to escort me here
preferred our living quarters.

01:10:32.918 --> 01:10:35.543
They decided to stay back.

01:10:35.543 --> 01:10:37.126
Peshwa, do not forget...

01:10:37.126 --> 01:10:39.751
That your army of 20,000 men...

01:10:40.918 --> 01:10:43.335
Horses and elephants,
stands guard outside.

01:10:43.335 --> 01:10:49.001
But what you do not know is that
40,000 Maratha soldiers stand behind them...

01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:51.668
Awaiting my signal
to decimate you.

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:55.793
What do you want?

01:11:01.501 --> 01:11:02.710
All of India.

01:11:07.126 --> 01:11:08.335
But for now, your silence.

01:11:08.335 --> 01:11:11.460
When I march on Delhi,
you will not utter a word.

01:11:13.001 --> 01:11:13.876
I accept.

01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:14.751
Secondly...

01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:19.585
...You shall return all captured
Maratha estates to our King.

01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:20.876
I accept.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.293
And thirdly...

01:11:28.085 --> 01:11:29.960
When I welcome you with open arms,..

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.501
...you shall forget past animosity
and accept my friendship.

01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:33.585
Here!

01:12:09.335 --> 01:12:12.793
Let the drums roll...

01:12:12.793 --> 01:12:15.668
Victory is ours!

01:12:15.668 --> 01:12:18.710
"We unbeatable warriors..."

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:22.085
Have crushed the enemy!

01:13:31.001 --> 01:13:36.876
The sparks of victory are ablaze.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:43.126
Our hearts are overflowing with pride.

01:13:43.126 --> 01:13:49.626
Even the night sky
is full of rainbows!

01:14:17.918 --> 01:14:21.751
Our camp is bursting with energy!

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:28.168
Our celebration knows no bounds.

01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:31.418
This victory...

01:14:31.418 --> 01:14:32.960
Our victory...

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.418
This victory of ours is like no other!

01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:28.168
Mother!

01:15:29.126 --> 01:15:31.668
Bajirao's message!

01:15:31.668 --> 01:15:33.960
What does it say, Chimaji?

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.626
His meeting with the Nizam...

01:15:37.293 --> 01:15:38.918
...was successful!

01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:43.585
Praise the Lord!

01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:50.001
Stop crying, Kashi!

01:15:50.835 --> 01:15:54.876
My son has not seen defeat
since she walked into this house.

01:15:55.168 --> 01:15:57.793
Your unborn child is destined for
great things too, Kashi.

01:15:57.793 --> 01:16:01.918
Mother, there should be a feast
for the Brahmins to celebrate!

01:16:01.918 --> 01:16:02.918
Agreed.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:06.168
Send out an invitation
to Krishna Bhatt...

01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:09.751
That we shall host
the Brahmins this afternoon.

01:16:10.793 --> 01:16:11.668
Start the preparations!

01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:15.668
Chimaji...

01:16:16.376 --> 01:16:18.710
Send a message to Mastani as well.

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:34.460
Eid Mubarak in this new house,
My Lady! Where is my gift?

01:16:35.626 --> 01:16:36.835
What's there?

01:16:37.918 --> 01:16:39.960
I thought the Peshwa called my name.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.376
How is that possible, My Lady!

01:16:42.376 --> 01:16:46.085
He will first go to Shaniwar Wada to
celebrate his victory over the Nizam.

01:16:48.335 --> 01:16:50.168
Mastani Saheba!

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:12.168
What is this Bajirao!

01:17:12.335 --> 01:17:14.918
The power of your love Mastani!

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.710
I wish you on your victory.

01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:19.626
And I wish you a happy Eid.

01:17:38.876 --> 01:17:42.793
Your face is glowing Mastani.

01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:46.251
Because you have returned.

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:51.835
It's like the glow in the sky,
just before sunrise...

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:56.001
We'll have to think of a name for our
to-be born child!

01:18:09.376 --> 01:18:11.085
My Lady!

01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:14.376
There's a message for you
from the Peshwa's mother...

01:18:16.376 --> 01:18:17.376
What is it?

01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:20.876
There shall be a celebration tonight
in honour of the Peshwa's victory...

01:18:20.876 --> 01:18:24.918
On this occasion, Mastani is ordered
to present her dance...

01:18:39.793 --> 01:18:43.168
Your Ladyship, the food is sewed
and the Brahmins are waiting...

01:18:43.168 --> 01:18:44.501
Why is the Peshwa not here?

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:47.001
He is on his way,
please begin the feast.

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:49.210
But how can we begin without the host?

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.543
My Lady!

01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:52.876
Did you send the message?

01:18:52.876 --> 01:18:54.668
Yes, but...

01:18:55.043 --> 01:18:56.210
But what?

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:59.251
Mastani Saheba will no longer perform
as a court dancer.

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.168
Says who?

01:19:01.168 --> 01:19:02.501
Mastani?

01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:05.043
No, My Lady... The Peshwa.

01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:08.918
He also said that he shall return
after the Eid feast...

01:19:08.918 --> 01:19:11.293
You need not wait for him.

01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:14.460
Dear God...

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.793
Krishnaji...

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.126
We cannot eat in this house anymore!!

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:22.001
Krishna Bhatt, you disrespect
the Peshwa by doing so!

01:19:22.001 --> 01:19:25.126
And hasn't the Peshwa disrespected us?

01:19:25.876 --> 01:19:28.376
Charity is doled
out at mosques as well.

01:19:28.376 --> 01:19:30.960
Let's go!

01:19:45.043 --> 01:19:46.293
Welcome home, Bajirao.

01:19:46.793 --> 01:19:48.710
Congratulations on
your win over the Nizam.

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:49.793
I wish you the same.

01:19:50.168 --> 01:19:51.460
Live long!

01:19:51.793 --> 01:19:53.918
Forgive me, I am late.

01:19:53.918 --> 01:19:57.918
While you were celebrating
Eid at Kothrud Palace...

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.126
The brahmins left
without eating a morsel.

01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:02.876
Never mind, we can invite them back
tomorrow and celebrate twice over.

01:20:03.335 --> 01:20:04.710
Why twice?

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:08.043
Mastani is about to become
the mother of my child.

01:20:10.918 --> 01:20:16.085
If the Brahmins walked out because
you chose to celebrate Eid with her...

01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:19.168
What'll they do when
this news gets out, Bajirao?

01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:20.001
Mother...

01:20:20.001 --> 01:20:21.543
Don't interrupt me!

01:20:25.585 --> 01:20:31.251
I suggest, we don't tell Kashi.

01:20:33.585 --> 01:20:36.918
What is there to hide mother?

01:20:36.918 --> 01:20:41.001
The truth is, what it is!

01:20:52.293 --> 01:20:53.960
Kashi...

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:58.918
I have been looking
for you all over and here you are.

01:20:59.668 --> 01:21:01.543
I was looking at the moon...

01:21:10.335 --> 01:21:11.918
I want to tell you
something important.

01:21:11.918 --> 01:21:14.960
That you have already eaten.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.710
Here's your paan.

01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:19.293
No, that's not it.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:21.585
Kashi, there's someone else...

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:24.001
So the rumours are true.

01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:24.960
What rumours?

01:21:25.668 --> 01:21:28.168
That the Peshwa's caught the evil eye.

01:21:28.335 --> 01:21:32.376
Never mind the rumours...
I don't believe in superstitions.

01:21:32.376 --> 01:21:33.668
But I do...

01:21:34.126 --> 01:21:35.418
Here...

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.543
Dear Mastani...

01:22:56.543 --> 01:23:02.126
Fighting in the battlefield is far easier than
fighting to keep your relationships intact.

01:23:02.751 --> 01:23:07.585
My heart wishes to be with you
every single moment.

01:23:08.335 --> 01:23:13.335
But I cannot meet you till I, myself,
don't inform Kashi of our relationship.

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:19.001
Kashi is not just my first wife...
She is my friend and confidant too.

01:23:19.585 --> 01:23:23.085
Until then,
please take care of yourself.

01:23:47.543 --> 01:23:49.085
Jhumri...

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.751
My Lady!

01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:56.460
What news have you brought,
Veer Singh?

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.335
I couldn't deliver your message to
the Peshwa even today...

01:23:58.793 --> 01:24:01.918
News is that he is very ill and
unable to meet anyone.

01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:06.126
Get the palanquin ready.
I shall go to meet him right away.

01:24:06.126 --> 01:24:07.501
This news could be false, My Lady...

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:08.668
It could be true!

01:24:08.668 --> 01:24:12.085
Going to Shaniwar Wada at this hour
could be dangerous for you.

01:24:25.835 --> 01:24:26.960
Mahipat Rao...

01:24:27.335 --> 01:24:28.710
Veer Singh, what are you doing here?

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:31.626
Mastani Saheba is
here to meet the Peshwa.

01:24:31.626 --> 01:24:32.418
He is in his office.

01:24:32.418 --> 01:24:33.460
Who is there?

01:24:34.376 --> 01:24:36.126
Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:47.960
Shalubai!

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:50.668
Shalubai!

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:51.626
Yes.

01:24:51.626 --> 01:24:54.418
See who that is.

01:24:54.418 --> 01:24:55.585
Yes.

01:25:03.793 --> 01:25:05.960
Shalubai... Who is it?

01:25:06.293 --> 01:25:08.543
It is Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

01:25:08.543 --> 01:25:11.960
So where is Gopikabai's palanquin...
They had left together.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.876
Shall I find out?

01:25:12.876 --> 01:25:15.168
No, I'll go myself.

01:25:20.626 --> 01:25:24.168
Mastani Saheba, please
wait at the Palace of Mirrors...

01:25:24.335 --> 01:25:25.501
I shall inform the Peshwa.

01:25:59.418 --> 01:26:02.335
Mastani, what brings
you here at this hour?

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:10.293
Bajirao.

01:26:10.293 --> 01:26:14.001
You shouldn't have risked your life
by coming here.

01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:17.210
There's no bigger risk to my life
than spending a moment without you.

01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:19.460
You never got my letter...

01:26:25.001 --> 01:26:28.043
These fort walls have
become too high to scale.

01:26:28.043 --> 01:26:29.793
Yet here you are, Mastani.

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:34.585
It's true that nothing can come in
the way of love.

01:28:15.001 --> 01:28:17.168
Lady Kashi's palanquin is here...

01:28:17.168 --> 01:28:21.043
Has the crib reached her quarters?

01:28:21.043 --> 01:28:24.126
Dear God! It slipped my mind!
I'll check right away.

01:28:24.126 --> 01:28:27.751
The Peshwa must be
arriving any minute now!

01:28:29.043 --> 01:28:30.543
My Lady...

01:28:31.085 --> 01:28:34.293
I stand to welcome
you like you always do...

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:37.085
You have brought back
light to this lifeless..

01:28:37.085 --> 01:28:39.126
...palace by returning
from your maternal home.

01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:43.418
Let me see our youngest warrior!

01:28:53.376 --> 01:28:55.085
N's a boy!

01:28:55.293 --> 01:28:59.376
Here, Here!

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.168
Strong lad!

01:29:02.335 --> 01:29:05.335
You will be a warrior
even greater than Bajirao.

01:29:05.793 --> 01:29:09.001
You have your mother's beautiful eyes...

01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:19.418
Stop!

01:29:19.418 --> 01:29:20.210
Let me in!

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:21.376
You cannot!

01:29:21.376 --> 01:29:23.626
I must meet My Lord!

01:29:23.626 --> 01:29:25.460
It is not possible at this hour.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.335
My Lord!

01:29:31.501 --> 01:29:34.251
Make haste My Lord,
Mastani Saheba is in great pain.

01:29:34.251 --> 01:29:36.126
No midwife or doctor
is willing to attend to her.

01:29:36.335 --> 01:29:37.168
What if-

01:29:37.168 --> 01:29:38.501
She will be fine.

01:29:39.585 --> 01:29:46.751
A tigress needs no
doctors or midwives...

01:29:49.085 --> 01:29:51.085
Isn't it Chimaji?

01:30:09.626 --> 01:30:14.418
My Lady is truly suffering, Sir...
And no one is ready to help!

01:30:25.793 --> 01:30:29.168
Mastani, breathe...

01:30:32.376 --> 01:30:34.751
Giving birth to a
warrior is never easy.

01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:03.710
Look!

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:05.835
Krishna

01:31:06.876 --> 01:31:08.001
Krishna

01:31:11.876 --> 01:31:13.210
Krishna

01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:16.793
Upon my return from the north,..

01:31:16.793 --> 01:31:19.085
...I'll organise a naming
ceremony for both my sons.

01:31:44.126 --> 01:31:47.168
Don't toy with our patience anymore...

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:51.793
Aunt Bhiu,
tell us what name you have chosen.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.418
Tell us.

01:31:58.168 --> 01:32:00.585
Well, what will it be?

01:32:00.585 --> 01:32:01.543
Raghunath!

01:32:02.585 --> 01:32:03.543
Raghunath!

01:32:07.168 --> 01:32:10.418
When Bajirao is back, he will be happy
to hear the name.

01:32:14.293 --> 01:32:16.085
My Raghoba.

01:32:16.085 --> 01:32:18.293
What a lovely name, My Lady.

01:32:22.835 --> 01:32:24.293
Welcome, Mastani.

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:30.668
Welcome!

01:32:30.668 --> 01:32:33.043
You have come at an opportune moment.

01:32:35.043 --> 01:32:38.418
Glad you could come.

01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:40.501
Mother...

01:32:41.293 --> 01:32:44.335
How can someone lose all shame..

01:32:44.335 --> 01:32:46.501
...and keep returning to
your doorstep to be insulted?

01:32:46.835 --> 01:32:48.751
What offence can come
at your own doorstep?

01:32:50.501 --> 01:32:52.460
No insult can come by your own people.

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:55.793
I am here to bless Bajirao's child.

01:32:55.793 --> 01:32:58.626
Are you here to bless relations
or to beg acceptance?

01:32:59.376 --> 01:33:02.418
I am here with gifts on
Bajirao's behalf in his absence.

01:33:02.418 --> 01:33:05.376
If you had to please
your way into our family...

01:33:05.376 --> 01:33:10.668
Then you should've got saffron clothes
and not this green coloured poison.

01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:15.001
People have associated each religion
with color, but color has no religion...

01:33:15.418 --> 01:33:20.210
It is when the heart turns black that
you start differentiating on such grounds.

01:33:20.418 --> 01:33:21.835
Leave it, Chimaji...

01:33:21.835 --> 01:33:23.210
She has forgotten the difference..

01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:25.460
...between durga(a Hindu goddess)
and dargah(Muslim shrine).

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:32.460
Perhaps you forget that idols in
temples are often adorned in green...

01:33:33.168 --> 01:33:36.960
And saffron sheets
cover the purest Sufi tombs.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.960
Where is the thought
of color and religion then?

01:33:41.418 --> 01:33:45.918
Bajirao merely holds your hand and
your tongue begins to cut like a sword.

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:51.918
A warrior's instinct is to reach for her
sword even when struck by a pebble.

01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:53.460
Krishna Bhatt...

01:33:53.835 --> 01:33:58.001
This year when we pray for the
deceased, add a prayer for her too...

01:33:58.376 --> 01:34:00.918
So that she is dead for us.

01:34:01.501 --> 01:34:02.501
Leave us now!

01:34:02.918 --> 01:34:05.960
Those prayers are not for strangers,
Mother...

01:34:06.793 --> 01:34:09.793
I'm grateful you thought
of me as your own.

01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.793
Welcome!

01:34:53.543 --> 01:34:58.001
I want you to organise
my son's naming ceremony.

01:34:58.501 --> 01:35:01.543
That's already been done, My Lord.
He has a blessed birth chart.

01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:04.501
No, not Raghunath... I am
talking about my other son, Krishna.

01:35:04.501 --> 01:35:05.710
He is my son too.

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:07.418
My Lord,
traditions do not permit that.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.168
Why?

01:35:10.293 --> 01:35:13.460
As per our tradition, a son
inherits his father's religion...

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.585
Isn't that right?

01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:17.376
How can you be wrong, My Lord.

01:35:17.585 --> 01:35:21.001
But it is imperative for
the child's parents to be...

01:35:21.001 --> 01:35:22.751
married under the Hindu law.

01:35:23.293 --> 01:35:27.126
I shall marry Mastani
as per the Hindu law.

01:35:27.126 --> 01:35:28.626
Begin the preparations.

01:35:29.293 --> 01:35:31.043
I'm afraid it still won't be possible.

01:35:31.043 --> 01:35:31.751
Why not?

01:35:31.918 --> 01:35:35.751
Krishna was born out of wedlock
and he shall always remain...

01:35:36.043 --> 01:35:37.251
illegitimate!

01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:38.210
Am I right?

01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:39.460
Yes, yes...

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.543
Your thinking is illegitimate,
Krishna Bhatt.

01:35:43.043 --> 01:35:47.668
Religion is bigger than anything,
My Lord... Even you!

01:35:47.668 --> 01:35:51.001
We cannot be a part of such blasphemy!

01:35:51.001 --> 01:35:53.085
Your thoughts do not matter to me.

01:35:53.085 --> 01:35:56.210
If you cannot initiate
him into my faith...

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.793
Then he shall follow his mother's.

01:35:59.668 --> 01:36:02.960
And from today he will not be
called Krishna, but Shamsher Bahadur!

01:36:04.418 --> 01:36:06.376
Leave.

01:36:12.376 --> 01:36:14.418
We need to speed up tax collections.

01:36:14.418 --> 01:36:16.168
Send a message to the collectors.

01:36:16.835 --> 01:36:18.876
Why are these sweets
being distributed?

01:36:19.418 --> 01:36:21.460
What is the occasion?

01:36:21.793 --> 01:36:23.043
Who are these from?

01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:24.960
These are from me.

01:36:25.918 --> 01:36:27.293
Please have.

01:36:27.293 --> 01:36:30.793
Chimaji, it's your favourite.

01:36:34.501 --> 01:36:36.126
What is the occasion, brother?

01:36:36.126 --> 01:36:39.668
I had a naming ceremony for Krishna
and changed his name.

01:36:40.043 --> 01:36:41.918
And what have you named him, My Lord?

01:36:42.543 --> 01:36:44.001
Shamsher Bahadur.

01:36:47.335 --> 01:36:49.918
The name of Peshwa's Muslim lineage.

01:36:55.793 --> 01:36:59.043
You all may leave.

01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:05.085
Panth, look at his face!

01:37:09.835 --> 01:37:10.918
Read it.

01:37:13.043 --> 01:37:17.543
The Peshwa decrees two estates to
be gifted to Mastani Bajirao Ballad.

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:21.501
Impossible, Bajirao!

01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:23.168
We do not entertain such practices.

01:37:23.168 --> 01:37:24.960
From this day on, we shall.

01:37:26.501 --> 01:37:27.418
What say, Panth?

01:37:27.418 --> 01:37:29.960
I fail to understand, why does
she need estates when you are here?

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.710
Don't you see, Panth?

01:37:32.543 --> 01:37:35.460
If they can throw her out of my house
while I'm alive...

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.960
Imagine how they'd
treat her when I'm gone.

01:37:38.918 --> 01:37:42.501
You have to safeguard
the future of your loved ones.

01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:44.960
Today it's an estate, tomorrow you'll
gift her the entire Peshwa kingdom.

01:37:45.376 --> 01:37:47.376
You cannot gift away
territory at whim.

01:37:47.376 --> 01:37:50.460
But you can put up a woman
in a brothel at whim?

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.418
That is my understanding.

01:37:51.418 --> 01:37:53.501
Make me understand as well.

01:37:53.835 --> 01:37:55.126
A dagger deserves a sheath...

01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:56.918
A wife deserves a home...

01:37:57.293 --> 01:37:59.126
<i>And</i> a <i>mistress deserves</i> a <i>hovel!</i>

01:38:11.293 --> 01:38:14.001
You missed your aim, My Lord.

01:38:16.376 --> 01:38:19.376
No... Our relationship came in the way.

01:38:19.376 --> 01:38:20.710
That's why I say...

01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.085
You must end all relations that
become a hindrance.

01:38:25.835 --> 01:38:28.251
Sometimes your relations
themselves finish you.

01:38:30.418 --> 01:38:34.251
Seal the orders!

01:38:39.418 --> 01:38:43.001
Bajirao fought with his brother today
in front of the entire court...

01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:48.543
stripping his relationship
of dignity, all for that mistress.

01:38:50.543 --> 01:38:52.043
It's wrong!

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.918
I do not understand right or
wrong anymore mother.

01:38:57.126 --> 01:39:01.418
I lived my entire
life as his shadow...

01:39:01.793 --> 01:39:04.793
And one day he just
walked into darkness...

01:39:05.918 --> 01:39:08.460
Not once thinking that
this shadow will fade away.

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:11.793
No one can understand
your pain like me...

01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:16.210
The status of the lady of this house
may be as grand as a mango orchard...

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:20.460
Whose fruit is longed for by all...

01:39:21.501 --> 01:39:24.585
But to acquire the fruit,
one must stone the trees...

01:39:25.751 --> 01:39:27.668
And that is the orchard's destiny.

01:39:31.085 --> 01:39:32.085
Kashi...

01:39:32.501 --> 01:39:37.168
We should've sewn the flag green,
to the mistress's liking!

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.001
Oh Lord!

01:40:16.335 --> 01:40:25.043
(Chants)

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.085
Come, Krishna Bhatt. Hello, Mother.

01:40:31.085 --> 01:40:32.501
How did you know, My Lord?

01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:35.043
A warrior must always be alert.

01:40:35.043 --> 01:40:37.043
Enemy can strike at any moment.

01:40:39.126 --> 01:40:41.501
Raghav, greet your grandmother.

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.876
Shamsher, you too.

01:40:45.126 --> 01:40:50.251
Krishna Bhatt wanted to know, when you
will perform the repentance prayers.

01:40:50.418 --> 01:40:51.501
Repentance?

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:53.501
You used to perform it every year...

01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:57.085
For the gratification of martyrs' souls.

01:40:57.085 --> 01:40:58.960
You haven't performed it in two years.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.501
Yes, and it won't happen again.

01:41:02.168 --> 01:41:03.918
You are refusing it being a brahmin?

01:41:04.168 --> 01:41:07.043
I am brahmin only by birth,
but a warrior by destiny.

01:41:07.293 --> 01:41:10.543
This ritual is mandatory
for the purification of our soul.

01:41:12.376 --> 01:41:15.918
Alright, let's purify our souls...

01:41:17.085 --> 01:41:21.543
I shall bring Mastani to Shaniwar Wada
and give her the rights of being my wife...

01:41:22.293 --> 01:41:24.293
That can be my only atonement.

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.460
I am proud to have a son like you...

01:41:29.668 --> 01:41:31.918
Who knows how to respect a woman...

01:41:32.626 --> 01:41:34.918
But what you ask for is impossible.

01:41:35.793 --> 01:41:37.210
Never, my son!

01:41:39.251 --> 01:41:41.043
On Saptami (auspicious day)...

01:41:42.251 --> 01:41:44.460
I shall bring Mastani
to Shaniwar Wada.

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:50.126
The Brahmins shall ostracize the entire
Peshwa clan if that were to happen.

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.876
Welcome home...

01:42:28.501 --> 01:42:31.376
It shall be known
to all as Mastani Mahal.

01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:37.418
Panth...

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.585
Brother...

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.126
Chimaji...

01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:55.168
Everyone seems to be welcoming you
with their absence!

01:43:08.668 --> 01:43:11.335
Chimaji and Ambaji have
gone out to inspect lands.

01:43:12.043 --> 01:43:13.751
Mother has gone on a pilgrimage.

01:43:14.126 --> 01:43:16.460
So as the lady of this house...

01:43:17.543 --> 01:43:22.335
I welcome you and your guest.

01:43:25.793 --> 01:43:27.043
Come.

01:43:42.626 --> 01:43:45.710
Don't touch my feet! (A Hindu
tradition of giving blessings)

01:43:53.835 --> 01:43:56.001
Thank you for keeping my honour,
My Lady.

01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.210
It lightens my mind.

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.960
Don't forget My Lord...

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.376
This welcome stops at the threshold,
it doesn't extend to the heart.

01:44:41.710 --> 01:44:44.085
Nana! When did you arrive?

01:44:46.126 --> 01:44:50.335
You didn't write or send
a message from the capital.

01:44:50.835 --> 01:44:53.835
Had I known you were coming,
I would've welcomed you in style.

01:44:53.835 --> 01:44:54.418
Namaste.

01:44:54.418 --> 01:44:55.918
Stay blessed!

01:44:58.293 --> 01:44:59.668
You've grown so tall.

01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:02.626
Your moustache has started showing too.

01:45:03.126 --> 01:45:06.918
I hope you are learning
politics from the king.

01:45:07.085 --> 01:45:07.876
Yes.

01:45:08.126 --> 01:45:11.335
I wish you learnt some
politics as well, Mother.

01:45:11.335 --> 01:45:12.418
Meaning?

01:45:13.501 --> 01:45:18.293
The man for whom you hold this flame,
doesn't deserve it.

01:45:18.293 --> 01:45:19.376
What have you done?

01:45:21.668 --> 01:45:23.251
What did you do, Nana?

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:26.626
Do you know who you are talking about?

01:45:26.918 --> 01:45:28.210
Yes, Mother.

01:45:28.835 --> 01:45:31.668
The man who is the talk of every town
from Pune to the capital...

01:45:32.335 --> 01:45:35.293
For burning his own home
with Bundelkhand's torch.

01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:38.460
Yet you sit here praying for him!

01:45:38.835 --> 01:45:40.210
Nana!

01:45:50.501 --> 01:45:53.335
Don't worry about me so much, my son.

01:46:15.668 --> 01:46:16.710
My Lady!

01:46:17.418 --> 01:46:20.168
Shiva Bhatt, you startled me!

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.501
The prayers are about to start

01:46:21.501 --> 01:46:23.501
My Lady, a grave disaster
is about to happen tonight.

01:46:24.293 --> 01:46:25.126
What disaster?

01:46:25.585 --> 01:46:28.043
While we pray,
Mastani Mahal will be attacked.

01:46:28.376 --> 01:46:32.418
She will be murdered.
Please save her if you can!

01:46:41.918 --> 01:46:55.043
Hail Lord Ganesha
(Hindu God of obstacles).

01:50:56.376 --> 01:50:59.168
How shall you atone for this crime,
Krishna Bhatt?

01:50:59.168 --> 01:51:03.710
What proof exists that Krishna Bhatt
has murdered Shiva Bhatt?

01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:05.251
Mother...

01:51:06.543 --> 01:51:08.043
How shall you atone for this crime?

01:51:08.043 --> 01:51:10.501
What atonement, what punishment?

01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:13.710
Whoever opposes religion
will meet such an end.

01:51:14.126 --> 01:51:18.960
It was your mistress's good fortune, else
she would've been cut to pieces as well.

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:07.460
My Lord, your mother is here.

01:52:08.168 --> 01:52:12.543
Why have we been summoned like
criminals, despite sharing the same roof?

01:52:12.835 --> 01:52:17.418
When walls come up between hearts,
they no longer hold a house together.

01:52:17.918 --> 01:52:19.668
Yes, we get it!

01:52:20.043 --> 01:52:21.960
Why have you summoned us?
What's our crime?

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.043
Krishna Bhatt!

01:52:27.293 --> 01:52:30.543
Protecting a criminal is your crime.

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.793
How dare you talk
to mother in this manner!

01:52:32.793 --> 01:52:34.085
And you?

01:52:36.043 --> 01:52:37.918
How dare you talk to
the Peshwa in this manner.

01:52:37.918 --> 01:52:38.668
My Lord!

01:52:38.668 --> 01:52:42.085
Remind him,
I won't miss my aim every time.

01:52:42.085 --> 01:52:43.251
Bajirao, this isn't you...

01:52:44.168 --> 01:52:46.710
But the influence of Bundelkhand's
gift. She has gotten to your head.

01:52:48.376 --> 01:52:50.751
Bundelkhand's gifts
are on your head too...

01:52:51.418 --> 01:52:57.085
These jewels on your head, around your
neck; are all Bundelkhand's gifts...

01:52:57.085 --> 01:52:58.960
You can't accept these gifts?

01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:02.501
Then take them off!

01:53:13.668 --> 01:53:16.460
Bundelkhand's gifts are accepted,
not their daughter.

01:53:17.293 --> 01:53:20.043
Mastani as my mistress is accepted,
not as my wife...

01:53:21.293 --> 01:53:25.710
But remember mother, Bajirao's
love for Mastani is unconditional.

01:53:27.501 --> 01:53:30.501
Where do you find such
hatred for her, mother?

01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:35.918
Peshwa blood cannot be adulterated by
an outsider, it's that simple!

01:53:36.210 --> 01:53:37.918
That's been done... Now?

01:53:37.918 --> 01:53:39.085
That's what!

01:53:39.501 --> 01:53:43.543
You fight Muslims and yet
fell in love with one of them?

01:53:43.543 --> 01:53:47.210
I fight the Mughal dynasty,
not their religion.

01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:50.001
I ask you one last time...

01:53:50.626 --> 01:53:57.335
Bajirao shall remain Peshwa
only if Mastani is accepted...

01:53:58.293 --> 01:53:59.501
Agreed?

01:54:01.335 --> 01:54:02.460
No.

01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:26.960
It's yours!

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.043
Bajirao

01:54:55.001 --> 01:54:56.085
Kashi!

01:54:56.543 --> 01:55:02.293
I've been looking for you all over.
I've wished everyone except you.

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.210
Where are you going?

01:55:05.501 --> 01:55:06.710
I'll be back soon.

01:55:07.251 --> 01:55:08.793
But where are you going?

01:55:09.626 --> 01:55:10.918
Mastani Mahal

01:55:29.585 --> 01:55:31.626
I'm happy to see you, sister.

01:55:31.626 --> 01:55:34.668
My Lady'... Not sister.

01:55:35.918 --> 01:55:38.001
I'm the Peshwa's legally wedded wife.

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.418
Kashi Bajirao Ballad

01:55:41.710 --> 01:55:42.960
We've been related for years -

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.251
What relation?

01:55:46.668 --> 01:55:47.585
Say?

01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:50.501
The man you are married to,
is my husband as well.

01:55:53.126 --> 01:55:54.126
Maybe so.

01:55:54.418 --> 01:55:57.751
But as far as I know,
when a married man..

01:55:57.751 --> 01:56:01.585
...takes another wife,
she's known as a concubine...

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:06.460
It is such a heavy word...

01:56:06.835 --> 01:56:09.085
There is a simpler term for it...

01:56:09.543 --> 01:56:10.751
Mistress

01:56:20.335 --> 01:56:21.751
Such mockery is unbecoming of you.

01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:22.876
Really!

01:56:23.751 --> 01:56:25.710
But who understands
mockery better than you!

01:56:26.418 --> 01:56:28.585
Leaving your people
behind in Bundelkhand..

01:56:28.585 --> 01:56:31.126
...to run after a man
all the way to Pune...

01:56:32.043 --> 01:56:34.043
That, Mastani Saheba, is mockery.

01:56:34.293 --> 01:56:36.210
Do matters of the
heart have no meaning?

01:56:36.210 --> 01:56:38.751
What heart do you talk of?

01:56:39.251 --> 01:56:41.585
A heart that flitters
from one to another?

01:56:43.585 --> 01:56:46.210
There is no place
for such purposeless matters...

01:56:46.793 --> 01:56:48.668
Then your visit must have purpose too.

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:49.501
Of course.

01:56:50.335 --> 01:56:51.543
We have a festival today.

01:56:52.293 --> 01:56:56.085
Married women come together to celebrate
this day for their husbands' long lives...

01:56:56.085 --> 01:56:58.460
They adorn their
foreheads with vermilion.

01:57:02.835 --> 01:57:05.085
I can't demean you any further...

01:57:05.668 --> 01:57:09.626
But you will have to face
a lot of humiliation here...

01:57:10.043 --> 01:57:13.376
Don't take it to heart.

01:57:15.168 --> 01:57:21.876
Rao's happiness lies with you
and mine with his...

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:25.126
That's my purpose.

01:57:25.376 --> 01:57:26.626
Here, put.

01:57:32.626 --> 01:57:34.501
This is the hand he holds...

01:57:35.168 --> 01:57:38.918
He prefers holding
his sword to my hand...

01:57:39.335 --> 01:57:42.460
But he holds your hand
dearer than any sword.

01:57:42.668 --> 01:57:45.543
He has held my hand without
letting go of yours...

01:57:45.835 --> 01:57:48.585
He has loved me,
but not broken ties with you.

01:57:49.501 --> 01:57:54.585
He may call me his inspiration,
but you remain his strength...

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:57.960
His love for you has not withered.

01:58:06.793 --> 01:58:09.668
I may be illegitimate,
but your coming here..

01:58:10.835 --> 01:58:12.585
...has validated my
presence amongst you all.

01:58:19.751 --> 01:58:21.085
Here...

01:58:21.751 --> 01:58:25.251
This sari will look good on you.

01:58:30.418 --> 01:58:31.626
I'll take your leave.

01:58:50.001 --> 01:58:54.960
Let us celebrate the
sanctity of marriage.

01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:00.335
Let us pray for our
husbands' long lives.

01:59:20.335 --> 01:59:26.960
Here she comes, looking like Radha.

01:59:33.085 --> 01:59:42.085
My love's innocent beloved... She
appears at my door, like a full moon.

01:59:42.335 --> 01:59:52.960
Today on this occasion,
together we shall dance...

02:01:31.585 --> 02:01:37.293
Your love has caused me pain,
like a dagger through my heart.

02:01:39.418 --> 02:01:44.460
You may accuse me of anything,
but I'm just a soul lost in love.

02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:46.793
Maybe that's our destiny...

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.043
To love a man who can never belong
completely to either one of us.

02:02:47.085 --> 02:02:51.126
My Lord, Nizam's son, Nasirjung has
revolted against us.

02:02:51.376 --> 02:02:52.710
SQ?

02:02:54.376 --> 02:02:57.585
He has crossed the river Godavri
and is approaching Shahgarh.

02:02:59.585 --> 02:03:00.626
SQ?

02:03:01.293 --> 02:03:03.293
It appears My Lord is intoxicated.

02:03:03.293 --> 02:03:04.085
SQ?

02:03:05.543 --> 02:03:08.251
Who is not?

02:03:08.543 --> 02:03:10.876
Everyone is intoxicated.

02:03:11.501 --> 02:03:17.418
By wealth, religion, power... Pratinidhi,
Krishna Bhatt are all intoxicated.

02:03:17.835 --> 02:03:19.793
So am I...

02:03:21.751 --> 02:03:23.710
I am intoxicated by love!

02:03:25.001 --> 02:03:27.418
You are unsteady, My Lord!

02:03:44.543 --> 02:03:48.585
My feet may be unsteady
but my grip is firm.

02:03:49.001 --> 02:03:50.585
<i>What say, Mama: Rae'?</i>

02:03:51.001 --> 02:03:52.210
Look!

02:03:54.793 --> 02:03:58.668
That is why we need you to
win this battle for us, Peshwa.

02:03:58.668 --> 02:04:00.085
I am no longer the Peshwa!

02:04:00.376 --> 02:04:01.668
But you are our Commander.

02:04:01.668 --> 02:04:03.460
I am not a Commander either.

02:04:09.835 --> 02:04:13.251
When you first learnt to ride,
we ran alongside your horse.

02:04:13.585 --> 02:04:16.085
We put in as much sweat as your steed.

02:04:16.335 --> 02:04:21.418
Malhar Rao fought battles beside you,
suffered injuries to uphold your honour.

02:04:21.668 --> 02:04:26.210
Tukoji nursed you despite
being wounded himself.

02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.751
Commanders aren't made overnight,
My Lord!

02:04:28.751 --> 02:04:36.460
And when the enemy stands at our
gates, you are abdicating your duties.

02:04:40.835 --> 02:04:45.501
Bajirao's heart may belong to Mastani,
but his life belongs to his homeland...

02:04:47.626 --> 02:04:50.085
A thousand Bajiraos and
Mastanis will be happily..

02:04:50.085 --> 02:04:52.710
...sacrificed for one
more Maratha victory.

02:04:53.918 --> 02:04:55.710
Let it be known...

02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:59.710
Bajirao will leave for
battle on New Year's eve.

02:05:02.043 --> 02:05:03.251
Praise the Lord!

02:05:03.918 --> 02:05:05.210
Praise the Lord!

02:05:05.751 --> 02:05:07.376
Praise the Lord!

02:05:13.126 --> 02:05:16.876
It's a day to light lamps,
not extinguish them.

02:05:17.751 --> 02:05:19.376
You didn't send word of your arrival.

02:05:19.376 --> 02:05:21.376
The Peshwa doesn't
inform of his plans.

02:05:21.376 --> 02:05:23.918
You haven't been here for a while.

02:05:24.501 --> 02:05:27.210
Those who wander can be found...

02:05:27.501 --> 02:05:32.376
But ones who lose themselves within
their own house are hard to trace.

02:05:33.251 --> 02:05:33.793
OK!

02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:38.668
As the first lady of this house,
won't you see me off to war?

02:05:40.376 --> 02:05:42.626
If clothes and jewels alone
make me Lady of this house

02:05:43.543 --> 02:05:44.668
(Calls out to Chambermaid)

02:05:45.918 --> 02:05:47.626
Bring the pooja thaali
(A prayer plate).

02:05:48.585 --> 02:05:52.043
Here, sit.

02:05:52.751 --> 02:05:54.793
I have left you alone, Kashi.

02:05:54.793 --> 02:05:56.418
I am never alone, My Lord.

02:05:56.418 --> 02:05:59.251
The entire day passes
in household chores...

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:02.668
And evenings are spent
with my Raghoba, listening to sermons.

02:06:03.585 --> 02:06:09.418
The Priest told us a nice story yesterday...
Sit with me, I shall tell you.

02:06:20.501 --> 02:06:23.585
The priest was saying...

02:06:24.835 --> 02:06:27.001
Lord Krishna and his wife
Rukmani were having a dialogue...

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:31.501
Rukmani said, I have loved you too...

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:38.460
Yet I wish I was your
beloved and not your wife.

02:06:38.918 --> 02:06:39.585
Why?

02:06:39.585 --> 02:06:42.585
Lord Krishna also asked, 'Why'?

02:06:44.418 --> 02:06:49.751
Rukmani said however deep a
matrimonial bond may be...

02:06:49.751 --> 02:06:52.460
The world always
remembers the beloved.

02:06:52.918 --> 02:06:57.626
Radhe Krishna, Radhe Krishna!
(Famous devotional chant)

02:06:58.085 --> 02:07:01.501
Kashi, you are as
dear to me as Mastani.

02:07:02.418 --> 02:07:05.876
Lord Krishna also said the same.

02:07:06.710 --> 02:07:09.460
I have never compared you two.

02:07:11.293 --> 02:07:13.626
There can be no comparison between us!

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:17.918
I didn't perform the Rasa Leela
(divine dance of passion) with you.

02:07:19.418 --> 02:07:22.001
Your complaints against
Mastani and I are justified.

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:24.085
What complaints can
one have against strangers.

02:07:25.376 --> 02:07:27.710
The wounds inflicted
by one's own hurt most.

02:07:30.168 --> 02:07:33.168
Had you asked for my life, My Lord...

02:07:33.168 --> 02:07:37.501
I would have
sacrificed it with a smile.

02:07:38.126 --> 02:07:41.876
But you've stripped me of my pride.

02:07:54.960 --> 02:08:00.251
I shall happily accept your punishments
for the hurt I've caused you.

02:08:00.251 --> 02:08:04.293
Punishments?
No, I shall give you good news.

02:08:04.293 --> 02:08:05.043
What do you mean?

02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:10.876
You shall never enter these chambers again.

02:08:13.710 --> 02:08:15.251
Do you know what you ask for?

02:08:15.251 --> 02:08:20.210
I took a vow to keep you happy
when I set foot in this house...

02:08:20.751 --> 02:08:21.960
I'm only trying to uphold it.

02:08:41.793 --> 02:08:43.251
Here!

02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:35.501
Praise the Lord!

02:09:36.126 --> 02:09:37.418
Praise the Lord!

02:09:39.626 --> 02:09:42.126
It's time to bid farewell, Mastani.

02:09:44.835 --> 02:09:46.960
I shall await your return.

02:09:50.043 --> 02:09:54.210
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

02:09:56.085 --> 02:09:58.460
The sky will change color, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

02:09:58.710 --> 02:10:01.960
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

02:10:03.001 --> 02:10:06.210
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

02:10:08.793 --> 02:10:11.960
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

02:10:12.376 --> 02:10:16.460
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

02:10:17.251 --> 02:10:21.876
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

02:11:15.668 --> 02:11:17.376
You called for me, grandmother?

02:11:17.543 --> 02:11:21.001
It's time to erase the dishonour
brought to our family, Nana.

02:11:22.210 --> 02:11:24.001
Arrest Mastani.

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:27.251
What shall we tell the Peshwa?

02:11:28.126 --> 02:11:29.460
Don't be scared.

02:11:30.293 --> 02:11:32.543
When it comes to
protecting the kingdom...

02:11:33.335 --> 02:11:36.251
Even the closest
relations must be sacrificed.

02:12:07.376 --> 02:12:12.710
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

02:12:33.543 --> 02:12:48.793
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

02:13:08.626 --> 02:13:11.085
We have surrounded Nasirjung
from all sides, Bajirao.

02:13:11.626 --> 02:13:13.210
Malhar Rao is in the
north with his troops...

02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:15.335
Vaman Rao and Ambaji
Panth are in the south.

02:13:15.918 --> 02:13:18.751
How shall we strategise the attack?

02:13:18.918 --> 02:13:20.293
Head-on.

02:13:21.418 --> 02:13:23.960
Like life does...

02:13:26.376 --> 02:13:28.793
You don't know when it hits you!

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.793
My Lord!

02:13:29.793 --> 02:13:31.626
What are you doing here, Veer Singh?

02:13:31.626 --> 02:13:34.460
Nana Saheb has arrested
Mastani Saheba!

02:13:51.418 --> 02:13:53.876
Bajirao!

02:14:10.168 --> 02:14:11.918
Go with Bajirao.

02:14:12.793 --> 02:14:14.293
Prepare for attack!

02:14:14.293 --> 02:14:18.126
(War Cry)

02:16:08.793 --> 02:16:12.335
It's your last chance
to return to Bundelkhand.

02:16:12.335 --> 02:16:14.793
I wouldn't have allowed these shackles
if I planned to return.

02:16:14.793 --> 02:16:19.543
My hatred for you goes beyond
its very essence, Mastani.

02:16:22.293 --> 02:16:25.335
Your hatred only
immortalises my love, Nana.

02:16:26.168 --> 02:16:27.126
Carry her child away!

02:16:27.126 --> 02:16:28.460
No need for that.

02:16:29.668 --> 02:16:32.293
Bajirao's son shall
walk out on his own feet.

02:16:35.043 --> 02:16:36.334
Shamsher Bahadur.

02:16:41.501 --> 02:16:42.418
Who is a warrior?

02:16:43.209 --> 02:16:45.209
He, who fears none.

02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:47.418
What is self belief?

02:16:48.251 --> 02:16:49.626
Sign of victory.

02:16:50.126 --> 02:16:51.334
Fear?

02:16:51.334 --> 02:16:52.918
Another name for defeat.

02:16:53.543 --> 02:16:54.876
Who shall be your ideal?

02:16:55.209 --> 02:16:57.876
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad.

02:17:02.918 --> 02:17:04.043
Goodbye.

02:17:04.543 --> 02:17:06.459
Goodbye, Mother.

02:17:37.459 --> 02:17:43.793
There's only one warrior in all of India
to have won forty consecutive battles.

02:17:44.334 --> 02:17:46.751
Peshwa Bajirao!

02:17:47.376 --> 02:17:50.543
Nasirjung has surrendered...

02:17:51.084 --> 02:17:52.918
Here's to one more Maratha victory!

02:17:53.918 --> 02:17:55.459
And my loss.

02:17:56.626 --> 02:17:57.793
I don't understand...

02:17:57.793 --> 02:18:01.334
Declare war...
I shall attack Pune next.

02:18:03.293 --> 02:18:05.459
I shall release Mastani.

02:18:05.918 --> 02:18:09.751
You will fight against your own family?

02:18:09.918 --> 02:18:12.334
You will turn against us for Mastani?

02:18:12.334 --> 02:18:16.584
And who will you kill?
Mother, Kashi or your son...

02:18:58.543 --> 02:18:59.251
Bajirao...

02:18:59.751 --> 02:19:01.584
I take your leave.

02:19:02.043 --> 02:19:06.126
We must certify this victory before
Nasirjung can change his mind...

02:19:08.834 --> 02:19:09.876
I'll be back soon.

02:19:13.668 --> 02:19:15.084
Please come inside, My Lord.

02:19:15.459 --> 02:19:17.293
This breeze could
aggravate your fever.

02:19:17.293 --> 02:19:24.668
I am waiting for someone...

02:19:27.209 --> 02:19:32.459
Mastani, you have run out of options,
so name your last wish...

02:19:32.668 --> 02:19:35.126
How would you like to die?

02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:38.459
With Peshwa Bajirao!

02:19:46.043 --> 02:19:48.543
This ailment is beyond
my understanding, Sir.

02:19:49.210 --> 02:19:52.543
The fever shows no sign of subsiding.

02:19:53.001 --> 02:19:56.335
It is time to call Kashi and Mother.

02:19:56.668 --> 02:19:59.460
Being with family
might improve his health.

02:20:52.335 --> 02:20:56.918
The king's orders are against us,
Grandmother.

02:20:57.168 --> 02:20:58.501
Are you listening?

02:20:59.543 --> 02:21:02.501
He says he cannot lose
a warrior like Bajirao...

02:21:03.793 --> 02:21:07.168
And hence we must release Mastani.

02:21:07.918 --> 02:21:09.460
I shall travel to
the capital tomorrow.

02:21:10.418 --> 02:21:11.793
I shall speak to the king.

02:21:11.793 --> 02:21:13.335
I shall travel to Ravelkhedi tomorrow...

02:21:15.376 --> 02:21:16.876
Bajirao is unwell.

02:21:17.418 --> 02:21:19.460
And nothing can happen
till I return with him.

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:27.210
Are you scared, Grandmother?

02:21:27.751 --> 02:21:29.751
You all may bow down before Mastani...

02:21:30.793 --> 02:21:32.918
But I shall not!

02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:36.085
I shall not!

02:21:46.793 --> 02:21:49.126
Look who is here, My Lord.

02:22:12.918 --> 02:22:13.751
Mastani

02:22:27.668 --> 02:22:29.168
ls Shamsher well?

02:22:30.501 --> 02:22:31.376
Yes, he is.

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:38.376
He's learning to ride.

02:22:41.918 --> 02:22:42.876
Kashi?

02:22:46.293 --> 02:22:47.418
She's well too...

02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:54.501
Busy pretending that her heart
has turned to stone.

02:23:07.585 --> 02:23:10.043
I need your stamp on this.

02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.460
Later.

02:23:11.626 --> 02:23:12.501
This can't wait.

02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:14.460
What is so urgent?

02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:15.918
Mastani's release orders.

02:23:17.668 --> 02:23:19.668
Have you lost your mind, Kashi?

02:23:19.668 --> 02:23:22.210
Only she can save Bajirao.

02:23:23.668 --> 02:23:24.960
I cannot approve this.

02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:26.793
I cannot see Bajirao losing himself.

02:23:28.585 --> 02:23:33.293
The man who never lost a
battle is losing to his own family.

02:23:33.293 --> 02:23:34.960
I cannot approve that!

02:23:36.835 --> 02:23:37.751
Stamp this!

02:23:38.626 --> 02:23:42.293
She has no rights in the Peshwa family.

02:23:42.293 --> 02:23:44.585
But I do... And I'm demanding it.

02:23:46.168 --> 02:23:47.918
As the lady of this house.

02:23:49.418 --> 02:23:50.418
Stamp this.

02:23:56.918 --> 02:23:59.043
Take this to Nana Saheb right away.

02:24:31.626 --> 02:24:33.543
What is the news from Ravelkhedi?

02:24:34.001 --> 02:24:38.793
How is the Peshwa?

02:24:39.501 --> 02:24:41.626
I too await news of him.

02:24:42.168 --> 02:24:44.460
Until then, pray for him.

02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:53.126
(Prayers)

02:25:25.126 --> 02:25:27.418
What is the message?

02:25:27.418 --> 02:25:34.918
Grandmother has ordered
Mastani's release.

02:25:51.335 --> 02:25:52.751
Where are you going, Bajirao?

02:25:52.751 --> 02:25:54.293
Look, Shaniwar Wada is on fire!

02:25:54.293 --> 02:25:55.918
No, it isn't...

02:25:56.335 --> 02:26:00.460
Bajirao, this isn't Pune...
We are in Ravelkhedi.

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.793
You are burning up!

02:26:02.793 --> 02:26:03.876
Mastani!

02:26:04.793 --> 02:26:07.626
She is on her way, Bajirao.

02:26:09.168 --> 02:26:11.918
You've been advised bed rest.

02:26:32.251 --> 02:26:33.293
Bajirao!

02:26:33.293 --> 02:26:35.626
The enemy...

02:26:36.751 --> 02:26:38.126
No one's there!

02:26:38.126 --> 02:26:41.418
Enemy with black flags!

02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:43.460
Which enemy?

02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:44.960
Destiny...

02:26:46.168 --> 02:26:47.460
God...

02:26:48.585 --> 02:26:50.876
Can't take Mastani away.

02:26:55.210 --> 02:26:56.918
Bajirao...

02:27:18.168 --> 02:27:22.418
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

02:29:41.918 --> 02:29:47.418
The sky will change color, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

02:30:08.501 --> 02:30:12.543
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

02:30:47.585 --> 02:30:51.751
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:11.168
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

02:31:13.043 --> 02:31:16.043
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:20.960
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:19.710
Our hearts beat together, Mastani.

02:32:21.126 --> 02:32:23.376
And cease together, too.

02:32:39.085 --> 02:32:43.293
On a day when fate
and time stood witness...

02:32:43.293 --> 02:32:47.335
Two star crossed
lovers breathed their last.

02:32:47.668 --> 02:32:52.210
They say witnessing a falling
star fulfills any wish...

02:32:52.585 --> 02:32:59.210
...But these two stars fell to earth
wishing only to belong to each other.

02:32:59.418 --> 02:33:01.668
They stand testament
to eternal love...

02:33:01.668 --> 02:33:03.960
Love, that knows no religion.

02:33:04.418 --> 02:33:07.710
Love that is a gift from God...
Love that in itself is Supreme.
