00:21.336 --> 00:23.337
Okay, kids, you know the plan.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.579
When the ship docks,
Gene: bam, bullhorn!

00:25.636 --> 00:28.661
Abandon ship!
For Bob's Burgers.

00:28.781 --> 00:32.375
Then, Tina, when people start
coming ashore: pow, coupons!

00:32.409 --> 00:34.944
50% off to all cruise
ship passengers. Pow.

00:34.978 --> 00:37.279
Try "poo." That
always gets attention.

00:37.314 --> 00:38.614
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No.

00:38.649 --> 00:39.949
Poo.
Use the bullhorn.

00:39.983 --> 00:40.950
No.
Poo.

00:40.984 --> 00:41.984
Never mind.

00:42.019 --> 00:43.052
Just don't say anything.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.203
Yeah, don't say anything.

00:44.237 --> 00:45.705
Where is everybody?

00:45.739 --> 00:47.406
Did you hand out the coupons?

00:47.441 --> 00:48.641
Yes. Oh, wait.

00:48.675 --> 00:51.143
No! What happened?
We practiced!

00:51.178 --> 00:52.778
We choked, Dad!

00:52.813 --> 00:55.081
We planned on handing them out,
but then it was noon,

00:55.115 --> 00:57.416
and then there was a bug
that landed on the ground,

00:57.451 --> 00:59.385
and anyway, the day just got
away from us.

00:59.419 --> 01:01.053
Oh, God...

01:01.088 --> 01:03.322
Rooty-toot-toot, someone's
wearin' a white suit!

01:03.357 --> 01:04.657
I think that's the captain, Lin.

01:04.691 --> 01:06.158
White pants, take a chance.

01:06.193 --> 01:07.927
Permission to come aboard?

01:07.961 --> 01:09.412
Permission given!

01:09.446 --> 01:10.596
I'm Captain Flarty.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.199
Is this restaurant seaman friendly?

01:16.937 --> 01:19.422
You know, I've tried burgers
from Maine to Mexico,

01:19.456 --> 01:23.192
but this is the best burger
I've ever had, Bob.

01:23.226 --> 01:24.527
Um, thank you.

01:24.561 --> 01:25.995
Maybe you could encourage
your passengers

01:26.029 --> 01:27.096
to try our burgers.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.764
I'll do you one better.

01:28.799 --> 01:32.168
Join me as a guest chef
on our cruise to Puerto Rico.

01:32.202 --> 01:33.769
Really? Ooh... Your family
will accompany you,

01:33.804 --> 01:36.956
of course.
Ten days, all expenses paid.

01:55.042 --> 01:57.059
Wow, that's, that's quite an offer...

01:57.094 --> 01:58.544
Uh... but we really can't afford

01:58.578 --> 02:00.279
to leave this place for that long.

02:00.313 --> 02:01.814
Come on! Hmph!

02:01.848 --> 02:04.400
Also, I'm, I'm supposed
to get a meat delivery,

02:04.434 --> 02:06.185
and the pickle guy's
coming, too, and...

02:06.219 --> 02:07.286
You're turning me down?

02:07.320 --> 02:09.354
Yeah. Sorry?

02:11.525 --> 02:13.159
Um...

02:15.195 --> 02:17.897
Well, then, would you at least
do me the honor

02:17.931 --> 02:19.565
of cooking just for tonight, Bob,

02:19.599 --> 02:21.751
at the captain's table
while we're docked?

02:21.785 --> 02:23.335
Say yes, say yes, say yes!

02:23.370 --> 02:24.687
Um... sure.

02:24.721 --> 02:26.355
Uh, yes.
Yay!

02:26.389 --> 02:28.390
Well, it's something.
We'll take it.

02:28.425 --> 02:31.827
Outstanding! And meanwhile, your
family will have, of course,

02:31.862 --> 02:34.497
free run of the ship,
and I, I do mean free.

02:34.531 --> 02:36.265
Take this VIP card,

02:36.299 --> 02:37.600
bride of Bob.

02:37.634 --> 02:39.235
Ooh...

02:39.269 --> 02:41.570
Women and children first.

02:41.605 --> 02:43.272
â™ª And VIPs!

02:43.306 --> 02:45.407
Everyone, listen!
This ship is...!

02:46.626 --> 02:48.894
Fancy? Was he gonna
say fancy?

02:48.929 --> 02:49.895
Sexy?
Pregnant?

02:49.930 --> 02:51.330
A grand old dame?

02:51.364 --> 02:53.899
Don't tell us!
Let it be a surprise!

03:00.273 --> 03:02.074
What's so funny?

03:02.109 --> 03:05.544
Oh, just, uh...
funny fish I saw.

03:05.579 --> 03:07.379
If it's that one, it's hilarious.

03:07.414 --> 03:09.322
If it's that one, it's dead,

03:09.442 --> 03:10.753
which isn't funny.

03:13.050 --> 03:15.051
Welcome aboard the
Windbreaker, Belchers!

03:15.085 --> 03:16.686
Uh, thank you, Captain.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.554
This is our first time on...
Aah!

03:18.589 --> 03:19.789
Kiki likes you!
Go on.

03:19.823 --> 03:20.890
Oh, don't be afraid,

03:20.908 --> 03:22.875
pet him, pet him.
Uh, no, thanks.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.445
What is, what is... what is he?
I want you to pet him.

03:25.479 --> 03:28.147
He's a capybara.
Aren't you a capybara?

03:28.182 --> 03:30.149
It's the largest member
of the rodent family...

03:30.184 --> 03:32.018
After Gene.
Mm-hmm.

03:33.053 --> 03:34.370
Oh, God.

03:34.404 --> 03:37.123
Oh, Kiki!
That's a big BM, yes.

03:37.157 --> 03:39.475
All right, dinner's at six bells.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.478
My first mate here, Mr. Asch,
will show you to the galley.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.848
And you'll show the captain's
table how burgers are done.

03:45.883 --> 03:47.183
All right, Bobby, have fun cooking!

03:47.217 --> 03:48.418
Yeah.
Come on, kids.

03:48.452 --> 03:50.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I want to see

03:50.254 --> 03:51.871
how far Kiki gets with Dad's leg.

03:51.905 --> 03:54.040
Yeah...!

03:54.074 --> 03:56.075
Bob, this is our head chef, Duval.

03:57.511 --> 03:59.379
If you'll excuse me, duty calls.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.581
My replacement.
I hope that you have

04:01.615 --> 04:03.516
a hairnet for your face and arms.

04:03.550 --> 04:05.017
I'm not replacing you.

04:05.052 --> 04:07.320
I'm just cooking one meal
for one night

04:07.354 --> 04:08.521
for the captain's table.

04:08.555 --> 04:10.356
You remind me of me,

04:10.391 --> 04:12.692
back when I was the captain's
special guest chef

04:12.726 --> 04:14.193
for just "one night,"

04:14.228 --> 04:15.695
56 voyages ago!

04:17.029 --> 04:18.331
Ah, there's the dinner rolls.

04:18.365 --> 04:20.016
Why does your timer sound like that?

04:20.050 --> 04:21.216
It's French!

04:22.786 --> 04:25.455
Okay, over there is the movie theater,

04:25.489 --> 04:27.256
and beyond that is
the rock-climbing wall.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.891
A talking manatee?!

04:28.926 --> 04:31.394
I don't know what that is,
but I got to see it!

04:31.428 --> 04:35.298
All right. Us girls are
gonna go hit the spa.

04:35.332 --> 04:37.433
Pass. I'm gonna go
write dirty words on

04:37.468 --> 04:39.051
sunbathers' backs in sunscreen.

04:39.086 --> 04:43.856
Yeah, I'd rather not spend
all day in a...

04:43.891 --> 04:45.758
I can go to the spa.

04:45.793 --> 04:49.061
Look at you, making hamburgers
with your fancy beef

04:49.096 --> 04:52.632
for the fancy captain's
table, Mr. Squishy-Squashy.

04:52.666 --> 04:55.618
Mm-hmm. The regular
passengers will be enjoying

04:55.652 --> 04:57.570
my fresh vegetable stew.

04:57.604 --> 04:59.539
Um, none of those
vegetables are fresh.

04:59.573 --> 05:00.807
The passengers don't care.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.775
They only complain if we run out.

05:02.810 --> 05:05.244
And when they complain,
the captain gets angry.

05:05.279 --> 05:06.946
Is he a little crazy?

05:06.980 --> 05:08.414
Shh! He can hear you.

05:08.449 --> 05:10.833
He put a microphone
in the cheese grater.

05:10.851 --> 05:12.735
Act normal.

05:12.769 --> 05:15.337
Come on.
Hum, hum.

05:15.355 --> 05:17.940
Okay. Uh...

05:17.975 --> 05:19.992
That's it.
Humming like normal.

05:20.027 --> 05:22.128
Okay.

05:22.162 --> 05:24.897
He's a former
regional Star Search finalist...

05:24.932 --> 05:27.850
she's the sexiest sea cow
on the ocean.

05:27.868 --> 05:30.786
Together they're Herman and Marilyn!

05:30.821 --> 05:33.189
Why were you out so late
last night, Marilyn?

05:33.207 --> 05:35.992
Listen to this one.
Always up my butt.

05:36.026 --> 05:42.915
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh, sexy lady,
ocean lady. â™ª

05:42.950 --> 05:46.018
This is so much safer than the sun.

05:46.053 --> 05:47.353
Come on, cook me.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.990
I can't work on minors.
Ship's regulations.

05:51.024 --> 05:52.458
I could lose my job.

05:52.493 --> 05:54.293
Marco, what if I told you I'm holding

05:54.328 --> 05:56.545
a life-threatening amount
of tension in my glutes?

05:56.563 --> 05:57.797
No glutes.
Calves?

05:57.831 --> 05:58.814
No.
Haunches?

05:58.849 --> 06:00.266
No.
Muffin top?

06:00.317 --> 06:02.602
Back fat?
No. Top of head only.

06:02.636 --> 06:04.687
Deal.

06:04.721 --> 06:07.056
Don't stop.

06:09.309 --> 06:11.694
Francesca, I don't want to be here,

06:11.728 --> 06:13.312
you don't want to be here.

06:13.347 --> 06:14.780
So let's make the best of it.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.682
Can you do this?

06:16.717 --> 06:21.204
Ooh! Cancel the rest
of my appointments.

06:21.238 --> 06:23.005
Nailed it!

06:23.040 --> 06:25.574
Why don't you jump into the
ocean and see me sometime?

06:27.027 --> 06:28.528
What's your name, handsome?

06:28.562 --> 06:29.812
No, it's Gene.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.247
Hi, Gene. Hygiene.

06:31.281 --> 06:33.299
Something this one could use
a little more of.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.301
Well, at least my jokes are fresh.

06:35.352 --> 06:36.569
Jokes? What jokes?

06:36.603 --> 06:38.170
You're the straight man.

06:38.205 --> 06:39.972
I use the term loosely.

06:40.007 --> 06:41.407
Well, you know loose.

06:41.441 --> 06:43.159
I prefer to be called
"flexible."

06:43.193 --> 06:45.761
My pants feel funny!
Good-bye!

06:47.598 --> 06:51.167
I need a summer drink
to go with my new summer glow!

06:51.201 --> 06:53.736
Hey, Isaac, daiquiri me!

06:53.770 --> 06:56.672
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Who wants apps?

06:56.707 --> 06:58.608
I'll take 'em all!

06:58.642 --> 07:02.111
Hi, Gene. My scalp massage was fantastic.
Thanks for asking.

07:02.145 --> 07:04.247
How was the puppet show?
Weird.

07:04.281 --> 07:07.416
I felt like I had to pee
the whole time, but I didn't.

07:07.451 --> 07:10.119
Whoo, throw a ripped wedding
dress on this daiquiri

07:10.153 --> 07:11.854
'cause it is not a virgin!

07:11.888 --> 07:14.390
Go ahead and give yourself
a big tip on goldie.

07:14.424 --> 07:17.877
And this is my son. You can't tell
'cause he's pale and I'm so dark,

07:17.911 --> 07:19.528
but take care of him, all right?

07:19.563 --> 07:21.530
Looks like the boy
who's sweet on you has

07:21.565 --> 07:23.266
a silver spoon sticking
out of his mouth.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.800
Mm-hmm.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.502
I think we just found our meal ticket.

07:28.005 --> 07:30.406
Duval, you're sweating into your stew.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.275
Eh, saves on salt.

07:32.309 --> 07:33.643
Oh, God.

07:33.677 --> 07:35.111
I'm glad I'm leaving after this meal.

07:35.145 --> 07:36.579
It's like a hundred degrees in here.

07:36.613 --> 07:39.599
Oh, sorry. I was
hogging the fan.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.767
Okay. That doesn't work.
Thanks.

07:41.802 --> 07:43.152
Cool off.
Thank you.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.704
Cool off.
Take it away.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.921
Here you are.

07:45.956 --> 07:47.590
Ouch.
It's on my face.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.925
Ah-ah.

07:50.611 --> 07:51.861
Ah-ah.

07:54.247 --> 07:55.414
Ah-ah.

07:55.449 --> 07:57.233
Come on, lady.
Let her play it.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.417
You've had plenty.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.671
Ugh! Oysters?

08:01.705 --> 08:03.472
Yes, they're for the brunch tomorrow.

08:03.507 --> 08:05.308
Duval, these oysters are spoiled.

08:05.342 --> 08:07.143
You're spoiled. Okay. I
don't know why I thought

08:07.177 --> 08:08.344
you'd be interested in that,

08:08.378 --> 08:09.679
but, uh, don't serve those.

08:09.713 --> 08:11.013
I am serving them.
Don't serve those.

08:11.048 --> 08:12.181
I'm serving them.

08:12.215 --> 08:13.916
Captain would like to thank the chef.

08:13.950 --> 08:15.184
Oh!
I meant Bob.

08:15.218 --> 08:17.519
Oh.

08:20.974 --> 08:22.174
Huh?

08:22.209 --> 08:23.943
Hmm.

08:26.179 --> 08:27.947
Psst. Urgent whisper.

08:27.981 --> 08:30.082
Meet me later.
Cabin 308.

08:30.117 --> 08:31.617
Me?

08:31.652 --> 08:34.003
No, the other handsome
young man I'm whispering to.

08:34.037 --> 08:37.173
I wish I could, but we're
leaving after dessert.

08:37.207 --> 08:39.140
Well, if you're looking
for something sweet...

08:39.176 --> 08:40.609
Who are you whispering to?! Him?

08:40.644 --> 08:41.844
Oh, leave him alone.

08:41.878 --> 08:43.596
You leave him alone.

08:43.630 --> 08:46.015
I think you've embarrassed
yourself enough for one night!

08:46.049 --> 08:48.951
Remember, cabin 308!

08:48.985 --> 08:52.288
Honored guests, let's give
a big Windbreaker salute

08:52.322 --> 08:55.291
to guest chef Bob Belcher!

08:55.325 --> 08:56.776
That's my man!

08:56.827 --> 08:59.445
He made your burgers
and he made my babies!

08:59.496 --> 09:03.265
Ugh. Okay, kids, come on,
time to go...

09:07.054 --> 09:09.905
Are we moving?
Bob Belcher, everyone.

09:10.857 --> 09:13.054
Where's the land?

09:13.105 --> 09:15.973
Where's the land?
Where's the land?!

09:16.008 --> 09:19.110
Next stop, Puerto Rico.
What?!

09:19.144 --> 09:21.913
Looks like you'll be
my private chef after all.

09:21.947 --> 09:24.649
No, you can't do...
Linda, we're being shanghaied!

09:24.683 --> 09:28.569
Shanghaied? Ooh!
Ancient Chinese vacation!

09:28.620 --> 09:29.587
Yay!
Yahoo!

09:29.621 --> 09:30.891
Boobies!

09:31.011 --> 09:32.087
What?
Nothing.

09:34.978 --> 09:37.112
All right,
steady as she goes, Bob.

09:37.147 --> 09:40.165
I wouldn't call a ten-day,
all-expense-paid cruise

09:40.200 --> 09:41.466
"being shanghaied."

09:41.501 --> 09:43.452
But you can't force my family to be on

09:43.486 --> 09:45.470
this crazy boat for ten days.

09:45.505 --> 09:47.272
Oh, come on, Bobby.
It's a vacation.

09:47.307 --> 09:49.474
You deserve it.
We all do.

09:49.509 --> 09:51.293
Stop fighting it.

09:51.327 --> 09:53.562
This isn't a vacation,
Linda, it's a kidnapping.

09:53.596 --> 09:55.030
This is a slave ship.

09:55.064 --> 09:56.665
You're disoriented, Bob.

09:56.699 --> 09:58.800
It happens to some people
when they're at sea.

09:58.835 --> 10:00.536
You'll adjust once you let
yourself relax.

10:00.570 --> 10:02.037
Yeah, Bob. Give in.

10:02.071 --> 10:03.488
We're not missing anything at home.

10:03.523 --> 10:05.257
Hey, Bob, it's Demetri.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.792
I'm gonna leave your meat outside.

10:06.826 --> 10:08.627
Uh, you and Linda are
probably upstairs.

10:08.661 --> 10:11.763
Back in five minutes,
right, buddy? Ooh-ooh-ah-ah!

10:11.798 --> 10:13.432
All right.

10:13.466 --> 10:15.500
Let's discuss your concerns
on the bridge, Bob,

10:15.535 --> 10:18.303
where there's s a ship-t-shore
radio you're free to use.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.806
You can call someone
and make arrangements.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.225
All right.
All right, good man.

10:23.259 --> 10:25.861
I'm gonna let him steer the boat.
That always works.

10:25.895 --> 10:27.496
You'll get your vacation.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.398
Kids, looks like we're on
this Puerto Rican cruise

10:29.432 --> 10:30.666
for the whole enchilada.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.867
So, now I can go to room 308.

10:32.886 --> 10:34.069
What's in room 308?

10:34.103 --> 10:35.404
I don't know!

10:35.438 --> 10:37.890
I wonder if Marco has
a 9:00 scalp shiatsu.

10:37.924 --> 10:39.558
I'll massage your scalp, Tina.

10:39.592 --> 10:41.876
Ow, ow, ow.

10:41.895 --> 10:43.345
So, how does this work?

10:43.379 --> 10:45.614
The coast guard sends
a boat for us or...

10:45.648 --> 10:47.032
Wait, this isn't the bridge.
Mm-hmm.

10:47.066 --> 10:48.367
This is the galley.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.269
And your home for the next ten days.

10:50.303 --> 10:51.670
You're out of your mind.

10:51.704 --> 10:53.438
Yes... with hunger.

10:53.473 --> 10:56.208
Now get cooking, 'cause I've got
room for another burger.

10:56.242 --> 10:58.694
And oh! Oh, it looks
like Kiki does, too.

10:59.946 --> 11:02.180
Let him finish!
Yes, sir.

11:02.215 --> 11:04.182
Go ahead, Bob.

11:04.217 --> 11:06.051
Go ahead, run!

11:06.085 --> 11:08.453
Unless you can run on water,
there's nowhere for you to go!

11:08.488 --> 11:10.022
Damn it, you're right!

11:10.056 --> 11:12.291
Who's crazy now, Bob?

11:12.325 --> 11:13.892
You still are!

11:13.927 --> 11:15.594
Ah...! Bob.

11:15.628 --> 11:17.696
Attention crew,
this is your captain.

11:17.730 --> 11:20.599
Our mustachioed guest chef
has gone missing.

11:20.633 --> 11:24.436
First one to find him gets
their passport back.

11:24.470 --> 11:28.140
All right, let's see
what these babies can do.

11:28.174 --> 11:31.576
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

11:31.611 --> 11:33.645
Francesca!

11:33.680 --> 11:35.814
Hey, Marco.
I'm four hours older.

11:35.848 --> 11:37.950
Maybe you can rub my neck now?

11:37.984 --> 11:39.318
Don't tire him out.

11:39.352 --> 11:41.219
Do you have penny slots?

11:41.254 --> 11:42.721
Yes, we do.

11:42.755 --> 11:44.573
Give me a whole roll of pennies

11:44.607 --> 11:46.091
'cause I feel lucky.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.793
Who is it?

11:47.827 --> 11:49.411
It's Gene.

11:49.445 --> 11:51.513
I can't talk long, he's in the shower.

11:51.547 --> 11:52.648
I got you this mug.

11:52.682 --> 11:53.782
I hope you "heart" cruising.

11:53.816 --> 11:55.567
Thank you. Uh!

11:55.601 --> 11:56.969
Marilyn, who
are you talking to?

11:57.003 --> 11:57.970
Uh, room service!

11:58.004 --> 11:59.171
He's jealous.

11:59.205 --> 12:00.906
He never lets me out of his sight.

12:00.940 --> 12:02.741
I just need 100 bucks
for new headshots,

12:02.775 --> 12:04.343
then I can go solo.

12:04.377 --> 12:07.279
But where, oh, where will I get $100?!

12:07.313 --> 12:09.181
Well, maybe you...

12:09.215 --> 12:10.515
Oh, Gene, thank you!

12:10.550 --> 12:11.984
It'll just be a loan, I promise.

12:12.018 --> 12:14.636
Here's your first interest payment.

12:16.639 --> 12:18.340
Marilyn, you never wipe the seat!

12:18.374 --> 12:19.808
There's sea water everywhere!

12:21.127 --> 12:22.494
Run, my little cabbage!

12:22.528 --> 12:25.314
Run to $100!

12:30.319 --> 12:32.020
Yes!

12:32.055 --> 12:35.390
Help! SOS!
We've been kidnapped!

12:35.425 --> 12:37.993
Sorry, please repeat!

12:38.027 --> 12:40.662
We've been kidnapped!
My family's on this boat!

12:40.697 --> 12:44.333
Is everything
okay or is there a problem?

12:44.367 --> 12:46.702
Th-The captain is crazy!

12:46.736 --> 12:47.903
Help us!

12:47.937 --> 12:50.505
All I hear is a funky bass line.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.708
I know, because he's doing it!

12:52.742 --> 12:55.410
Stop turning the music on!

12:55.445 --> 12:58.413
Ha-ha! Very funny! Screw you!

12:58.448 --> 13:01.817
What's the matter, Bob, you don't like

13:01.851 --> 13:04.986
high energy dance music?!

13:05.021 --> 13:08.573
Killer whale, killer whale,
killer whale! Orca!

13:08.608 --> 13:10.842
Whoo-ha-ha! Yeah!

13:10.877 --> 13:12.861
Uh, Bobby?

13:12.895 --> 13:14.996
Bobby?

13:15.031 --> 13:17.099
Have you kids seen your father?

13:17.133 --> 13:19.201
You mean that creepy guy
with the mustache?

13:19.235 --> 13:20.669
Yeah.
No.

13:20.703 --> 13:21.903
Hey, we're trying to sleep in here.

13:21.938 --> 13:23.305
Sorry.

13:24.557 --> 13:27.325
Penny angel! Feels good.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.727
Oh, feels good on my face!

13:28.761 --> 13:30.562
Pennies, pennies, pennies.

13:30.596 --> 13:32.230
Mom, we talked about this.
Pennies, pennies, pennies.

13:32.265 --> 13:34.566
Mom, stop. Pennies, pennies, pennies.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.202
You're better than this.
Pennies, pennies, pennies.

13:37.236 --> 13:40.505
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

13:43.392 --> 13:46.111
You made one mistake, Flarty:

13:46.145 --> 13:48.363
you let me live.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.765
Passengers, join us

13:49.799 --> 13:51.600
tomorrow morning
for Poseidon's Brunch,

13:51.634 --> 13:54.770
featuring Chef Duval's
famous Oysters Onassis.

13:54.804 --> 13:57.372
Kiki loves them, and you will, too.

13:57.406 --> 13:59.724
Oh, crap. The oysters.

13:59.759 --> 14:02.444
Row, row, row the boat...

14:02.478 --> 14:03.428
Duval?
Hmm?

14:03.463 --> 14:05.197
Is that you in there?

14:05.231 --> 14:07.799
No one's in this pot. Go
away. I am the spaghetti.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.034
Duval, you're not the spaghetti.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.435
I am spaghetti.
Let go of the lid.

14:10.470 --> 14:12.154
Just spaghetti in here.

14:12.188 --> 14:15.090
Val, stop. I'm trying to get
off the ship, all right?

14:15.124 --> 14:17.392
But first you have
to throw out those oysters.

14:17.427 --> 14:18.927
If I don't serve the oysters,

14:18.961 --> 14:21.997
Flarty will make me teach
pole-dancing to seniors.

14:22.031 --> 14:24.733
But if you serve them,
people can get really sick.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.102
It's like the Hippocratic Oath
of chefs, Duval,

14:27.136 --> 14:29.404
to not make people sick on purpose.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.239
Bob...
Yes?

14:31.274 --> 14:32.607
...kiss me.
What?

14:32.642 --> 14:34.242
You know you want to.
No, I don't.

14:34.277 --> 14:36.812
You didn't just want to
kiss me just now? I didn't.

14:36.846 --> 14:39.281
All right. But you're right.

14:39.315 --> 14:42.784
Come, let's throw out those
horrible oysters right now, Bob!

14:42.802 --> 14:44.119
Now you're talking.

14:44.153 --> 14:47.288
You first.
Way in the back.

14:47.306 --> 14:48.657
What the hell?!

14:48.691 --> 14:50.275
Duval, open the door!

14:50.309 --> 14:52.410
You spend the night in there.

14:52.445 --> 14:54.613
The captain is complicated,
but he knows what's best.

14:54.647 --> 14:57.816
Duval! Duval!

14:57.850 --> 14:59.251
I will kiss you.

14:59.285 --> 15:01.603
Too late.
The moment's gone, Bob.

15:01.637 --> 15:04.210
Duval! We can do more than kiss!

15:04.330 --> 15:07.242
Other things! Duval!

15:19.298 --> 15:21.098
Thanks for serving canned meat, Duval.

15:23.435 --> 15:25.269
Good morning, Windbreakers!

15:25.304 --> 15:27.104
Looking forward to seeing you all

15:27.139 --> 15:30.908
at Poseidon's Brunch,
featuring Oysters Onassis,

15:30.943 --> 15:34.512
as well as the catch
of the day.

15:34.546 --> 15:39.534
That one is a little
shout-out for you-know-who.

15:50.345 --> 15:53.481
Hmm? He's gone!

15:53.515 --> 15:55.216
Oh, damn it!
You get the brunch ready!

15:55.250 --> 15:57.018
You! You find Bob!

15:57.052 --> 16:00.988
When he runs, it only makes
me want him more, right, Kiki?

16:01.023 --> 16:03.074
Kiki-Kiki-Kiki.

16:04.426 --> 16:06.493
Little help!

16:08.814 --> 16:10.314
Oh, sorry.

16:10.349 --> 16:13.217
Louise, come here. Over here.
Oh, hey, Dad.

16:13.252 --> 16:14.852
Flarty is absolutely insane.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.821
He locked me in
his walk-in overnight.

16:16.855 --> 16:18.356
He's gonna serve rotten oysters.

16:18.390 --> 16:19.674
We've got to stop him.

16:19.708 --> 16:21.042
Oh, Dad, watch this.

16:21.076 --> 16:22.360
Clackety-clackety-
clackety-clackety,

16:22.394 --> 16:24.362
click-click-click-
click-clack. Huh?

16:24.396 --> 16:27.531
Louise, are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, I'll help.

16:27.566 --> 16:30.167
All right, good. First, we need
to distract Flarty and his crew

16:30.202 --> 16:31.869
while I take the oysters
from the brunch.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.804
Well, I am a master of distraction.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.573
Ow!
See?

16:37.376 --> 16:41.846
I'm gonna get you that
hundred bucks, baby.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.681
No! Those are for Marilyn!

16:43.715 --> 16:45.833
Ah! No! Drop it!

16:45.867 --> 16:49.537
We have personnel on every deck
looking for Bob, sir.

16:51.473 --> 16:55.009
Ha-ha! I got your rat!
My Kiki!

16:55.043 --> 16:56.377
Clackety-clackety-clackety-
clackety...

16:56.411 --> 16:58.446
Get her!

16:58.480 --> 17:00.815
Clackety-clackety-clackety-
clackety...

17:03.135 --> 17:06.369
So long, seamen!
Clackety-clackety...

17:11.393 --> 17:13.361
Where are you taking the oysters?

17:13.395 --> 17:14.895
Trust me, you don't want these.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.530
There's plenty of other things to eat.

17:16.564 --> 17:17.882
Don't tell me what to eat!

17:17.915 --> 17:19.849
Let go.
I'm trying to help.

17:19.885 --> 17:22.118
Yeah, help yourself.
Argh!

17:22.170 --> 17:23.569
They must be running out!

17:23.588 --> 17:25.906
Clackety-clackety-clackety-
clackety...

17:25.924 --> 17:29.060
I did it!
I did the distraction!

17:29.094 --> 17:30.745
Typically, Louise, when you do
a distraction,

17:30.779 --> 17:33.581
you don't lead everybody to me, right?

17:33.615 --> 17:34.548
Right!

17:34.583 --> 17:35.983
Okay, next time.

17:36.018 --> 17:39.787
How dare you use Kiki in
your sadistic game?

17:39.821 --> 17:41.255
My sadistic game?

17:41.289 --> 17:42.289
That's right, buster.

17:42.324 --> 17:44.091
You kidnapped us.

17:44.126 --> 17:46.494
Thank you again. I'm having
a wonderful time, Captain.

17:46.528 --> 17:48.379
Linda, are you kidding?!
Wha...?

17:48.413 --> 17:49.764
He shouldn't be captain.

17:49.798 --> 17:51.799
Anyone would be
a better captain than you.

17:51.833 --> 17:55.603
Sounds to me what's happening
here is a mutiny!

17:55.637 --> 17:56.837
Ooh, mutiny?

17:56.872 --> 17:58.906
This boat has so many activities!

17:58.940 --> 18:01.809
Go ahead, Bob.
You want a mutiny? Proceed.

18:01.843 --> 18:02.910
Okay.
Come on.

18:02.944 --> 18:03.911
All right.
Let's go.

18:03.945 --> 18:05.012
I will.
Go ahead.

18:05.047 --> 18:06.414
Here we go.

18:06.448 --> 18:08.082
Everybody...
Here we go.

18:08.116 --> 18:09.417
All right, let me...
Call a mutiny.

18:09.451 --> 18:10.951
I'm doing it!
All right.

18:10.986 --> 18:13.320
But if you fail, I'm
putting you in a dinghy

18:13.355 --> 18:15.022
with nothing but a compass
and a biscuit.

18:15.057 --> 18:17.324
Okay, fine.
So who's with me?!

18:19.627 --> 18:20.928
How about you,

18:20.962 --> 18:22.129
shorts-and-binoculars guy?

18:22.164 --> 18:24.031
You hate it here.

18:24.066 --> 18:25.266
Or you, prisoner guy.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.368
I saw you locked in that room, right?

18:27.402 --> 18:29.103
You've got to be on my side.

18:29.137 --> 18:30.471
Don't look away!

18:30.505 --> 18:32.606
Oh, Dad.
Oh, you're bombing.

18:32.641 --> 18:33.607
Oh, forget it!

18:33.642 --> 18:36.677
Get the dinghy!

18:36.712 --> 18:38.612
Captain, there seems to be
a problem with the buffet.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.464
Oh, boy.

18:40.499 --> 18:41.816
Uh, yup.

18:41.850 --> 18:45.319
Ooh, I love this song.

18:48.824 --> 18:51.125
Marilyn?! Marilyn...!

18:51.159 --> 18:52.993
Ugh!

18:53.011 --> 18:54.962
Marilyn, are you okay?!

18:54.996 --> 18:57.114
I found your eye, but I
couldn't get the money.

18:57.149 --> 18:58.482
But I will.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.217
Kid, forget it.
It's just a scam!

19:00.252 --> 19:01.385
What?

19:01.420 --> 19:02.820
Oh, God.

19:02.854 --> 19:05.022
Listen, you're a sweet kid,

19:05.056 --> 19:06.991
and you deserve better than
an old,

19:07.025 --> 19:08.976
an old sea cow like me.

19:09.010 --> 19:10.644
But, but...
Save your buts.

19:10.679 --> 19:13.380
Some things just aren't meant to be.

19:13.415 --> 19:17.551
Keep the eye. He's got a
whole box of them somewhere.

19:18.286 --> 19:20.488
Ah...

19:20.522 --> 19:22.323
What the hell was that about?

19:22.357 --> 19:23.891
I know she was a puppet,

19:23.925 --> 19:26.010
but she put her hand
right up my heart.

19:26.044 --> 19:27.144
Aw, sick!

19:27.179 --> 19:28.479
Don't worry, Gene.

19:28.513 --> 19:30.314
There's plenty of manatees in the sea.

19:30.348 --> 19:31.415
But there's not, really,

19:31.450 --> 19:32.483
because they're endangered.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.335
Mon dieu!

19:34.369 --> 19:35.986
Now can we go to some land?

19:36.021 --> 19:37.321
These people need a hospital.

19:37.355 --> 19:39.824
Give it up, Bob.
Your mutiny failed.

19:39.858 --> 19:42.443
Duval, make Bob a doggie
bag for his dinghy.

19:42.477 --> 19:44.895
No, Captain.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.330
I'm sorry.
Did you say no?

19:46.364 --> 19:48.015
Yes, I did.

19:48.049 --> 19:50.851
I gave you the best
cooking years of my life.

19:50.886 --> 19:53.287
And now on behalf of all cooks
and all oysters,

19:53.321 --> 19:55.389
I demand that you give up
your command.

19:55.423 --> 19:56.390
There you go, Duval!

19:56.424 --> 19:57.725
There you go, Bob!

19:57.759 --> 19:59.877
You're relieved of your
position, cook.

19:59.911 --> 20:02.546
Asch, remove Bob and Duval
from the dining room.

20:02.581 --> 20:04.949
Asch! Asch!

20:04.983 --> 20:07.251
Duval is right, sir.
I'm with him.

20:07.285 --> 20:09.370
I've cleaned up enough of your messes!

20:09.404 --> 20:11.522
Escort the captain to his stateroom.

20:11.556 --> 20:12.690
All right, you're doing great.

20:12.724 --> 20:14.608
Kiss me! Not now. Not a good time.

20:14.643 --> 20:15.709
Then when?!

20:15.744 --> 20:17.077
French kiss that Frenchman.

20:17.112 --> 20:18.979
Well, you've won, Bob.

20:19.014 --> 20:20.781
But remember this...

20:22.851 --> 20:24.268
What'd he say?

20:24.302 --> 20:26.070
Nothing.
He just burped.

20:26.104 --> 20:28.138
Ah...

20:30.358 --> 20:31.892
I miss you, Gene.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.645
I really, really miss you.

20:34.696 --> 20:36.747
Anyone need a mole removed?

20:36.781 --> 20:38.048
Ah, peel my back.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.951
Look, Marilyn, it's a meat farm.

20:40.986 --> 20:42.152
It's beautiful.

20:42.187 --> 20:43.904
Ugh! You've got
to be kidding me.

20:43.939 --> 20:46.123
I'm going to bed, I'm not
dealing with this right now.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.424
Or maybe ever.

20:47.459 --> 20:50.010
Well, I've never felt more rested.

20:50.045 --> 20:52.617
Like a protein sunset.
It's nice.
