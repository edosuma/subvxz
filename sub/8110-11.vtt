00:06.840 --> 00:09.777
* BUM BUM BUM BUM
BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM *

00:09.810 --> 00:11.312
* BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM

00:11.345 --> 00:13.547
* MR. SANDMAN

00:13.581 --> 00:14.782
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRESS
LIKE AN ITALIAN HOOKER,

00:14.815 --> 00:18.319
AT LEAST LET IT BE
THIS YEAR'S ITALIAN HOOKER.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.720
SHE'S NOT TELLING US
WE LOOK FAT.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.155
THAT'S A MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGH.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.523
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO BE INSULTED,

00:22.556 --> 00:23.691
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE INVITED ME.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.626
WOULD ANYONE LIKE
SOME CHAMPAGNE?

00:25.659 --> 00:28.129
NO.
YES, THREE GLASSES, PLEASE.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.298
MOM.
YEAH, IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT EVEN LUNCH.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.466
IF YOU'D PREFER,
I'LL MAKE IT A MIMOSA.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.202
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
PERFECT...

00:34.235 --> 00:37.171
FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.240
PERFECT
FOR BREAST-FEEDING.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.742
* PLEASE TURN ON
YOUR MAGIC BEAM *

00:41.775 --> 00:45.779
* MR. SANDMAN,
BRING ME A DREAM *

00:45.813 --> 00:48.549
MY HEART'S DOING
THAT WEIRD THING AGAIN.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.085
BEATING?
THAT'S NORMAL FOR HUMANS.

00:51.119 --> 00:54.122
COME ON, LISA, TAKE HER
SERIOUSLY FOR ONCE.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.589
*

00:55.623 --> 01:00.161
* MR. SANDMAN,
BRING ME A DREAM *

01:00.194 --> 01:02.330
* MAKE HIM THE CUTEST...

01:02.363 --> 01:05.666
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

01:05.699 --> 01:08.302
I THINK WE NEED TO GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:08.336 --> 01:12.106
* MR. SANDMAN,
BRING ME A DREAM *

01:19.347 --> 01:21.815
(cartoon character on TV)
I'M DYING TO TRY IT.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.852
[silly cartoon sound effects]

01:26.854 --> 01:29.357
IS NO ONE GONNA
TELL ME...
SHH.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.892
HOW DELIGHTFUL.
[belches]

01:31.925 --> 01:33.427
[softly]
WHY WE'RE IN THE MORGUE?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.695
HOUSE IS ON THE LAM
FROM SOMEONE.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.365
TAUB'S GOT HIS MONEY ON WILSON,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S CUDDY.

[door opens]

01:44.705 --> 01:46.740
SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.810
YES, JUST NOT ME.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.479
YOUR MOM IS
A 65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

01:51.512 --> 01:53.681
WITH HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.649
WHAT ABOUT
THE MACROCYTIC ANEMIA?
BORDERLINE,

01:55.683 --> 01:57.351
WHICH IS THE LAB EQUIVALENT
OF IMAGINARY,

01:57.385 --> 01:58.886
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
MATCHES THE REST

01:58.919 --> 02:00.221
OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.456
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S PSYCHING HERSELF

02:02.490 --> 02:05.259
INTO ATRIAL FIBRILLATION?
SO GET HER
A CARDIOLOGIST.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.694
YOU DON'T WANT ME
INVOLVED.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.761
YOU DON'T WANT
YOU INVOLVED.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.598
ALL THAT ETHICS STUFF
THAT I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT

02:10.631 --> 02:11.732
SUDDENLY MAKES SENSE.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.301
IF YOU'RE
EMOTIONALLY INVESTED,

02:13.334 --> 02:14.868
YOU CANNOT MAKE
RATIONAL DECISIONS.

02:14.902 --> 02:18.372
YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE
A DISASTER.

02:18.406 --> 02:21.409
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.913
TREADMILL TEST
WENT WELL--

02:25.946 --> 02:27.781
NO CHEST DISCOMFORT
OR ISCHEMIA.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.551
THE ABNORMAL RHYTHM
WILL PROBABLY RESOLVE ITSELF,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.953
AND IF NOT, A DAILY PILL
WILL KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.955
I WILL FOLLOW UP
LATER TODAY.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.490
IS IT CONNECTED
TO MY OTHER SYMPTOMS?

02:36.524 --> 02:39.460
WHICH OTHER SYMPTOMS, MOM?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.962
AYE...
NOT HER FAULT.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.331
THIS "DEAN
OF MEDICINE" STUFF--

02:43.364 --> 02:45.899
VERY IMPRESSIVE AT PARTIES.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.736
BUT SHE'S FORGOTTEN
HOW TO BE A REAL DOCTOR.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.305
IT'S ALL IN MY FILE.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.474
THERE ARE 15 YEARS
OF CLINIC VISITS IN THIS FILE.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.643
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A BOTHER.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.213
BUT ISN'T THIS WHAT
YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.586
SO...

03:05.619 --> 03:07.821
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DISEASE THAT
CAN LAST A DECADE AND A HALF,

03:07.855 --> 03:11.392
CAUSES CONSTIPATION,
DIARRHEA, FLU, COLD,

03:11.425 --> 03:13.761
DIZZINESS, RASHES,
BACK AND JOINT PAIN,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.397
"HEART FEELING WEIRD,"

03:16.430 --> 03:17.831
"KISHKES FEELING WOBBLY,"

03:17.865 --> 03:19.500
ONE ACTUAL HIP REPLACEMENT.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.436
AND WHICH HAS ELUDED DETECTION
BY YEARS OF BLOOD WORK,

03:22.470 --> 03:23.871
X-RAYS, AND MRIs.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.274
WELL, ONE THING DOES
POP TO MIND.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.475
WE'LL MONITOR YOU,

03:27.508 --> 03:28.942
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU
A THYROID TEST.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.744
AND HOUSE'S TEAM
WILL DO A HOME SEARCH

03:30.778 --> 03:31.912
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.882
HE SEEMS TO KNOW HIS STUFF.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.485
HOW COME HE CAN'T AFFORD
A COAT THAT FITS?

03:40.288 --> 03:42.356
(Masters)
NO LEAD IN THE PIPES.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.292
YEAH, YEAH, GREAT. HAVE YOU SEEN
CUDDY'S HIGH-SCHOOL YEARBOOK?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.959
OKAY, THAT IS CLEARLY
NOT RELATED TO THE CASE.

03:45.993 --> 03:46.827
THERE IS NO CASE.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.430
CUDDY WON'T LET HOUSE
SEE THE YEARBOOK,

03:49.463 --> 03:50.898
SO HE FIGURES
THERE'S SOMETHING TO HIDE.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.933
ANY GUESSES?
IT'S CLEARLY RELATED

03:52.966 --> 03:55.869
TO BEING A GIANT
TEENAGE DORK.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.871
SO YOU THOUGHT I'D HAVE
SOME INSIGHTS.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.906
OH, NO, NO.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.274
I DIDN'T MEAN.
RELAX.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.975
I WAS CROWNED
HOMECOMING GEEK.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.044
[chuckles]

04:04.077 --> 04:06.780
I'M SURE
YOU CAN RELATE...

04:06.814 --> 04:10.017
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
SOME DORKS.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.020
I WAS THE CLASS PRESIDENT
AND HEAD BOY AT--

04:13.053 --> 04:13.987
AAH!

04:16.524 --> 04:18.526
[gasps]
OH...

04:18.559 --> 04:20.328
IS THAT--
IS THAT CUDDY'S MOM?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.430
CERTAIN PARTS OF HER...

04:22.463 --> 04:27.067
AND CERTAIN PARTS OF SOME
MUSCULAR HISPANIC GENTLEMAN.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.101
SHOULD WE CONSIDER STDs?

04:28.135 --> 04:30.471
I THINK I JUST CAUGHT ONE
LOOKING AT THESE PHOTOS.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.441
WHAT DOES "AZARCON" MEAN?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.008
I--

04:35.042 --> 04:38.379
IT MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE
AN ACTUAL CASE.

04:38.412 --> 04:41.014
MEXICAN HERBAL MEDICATION
FOR STOMACH PROBLEMS,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.684
BUT ONLY IN THE SENSE
THAT LEAD CHROMATE IS AN HERB

04:43.717 --> 04:44.885
AND POISON
IS A MEDICATION.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.755
I'LL START A CHELATION I.V.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.990
THAT WASN'T TOO MUCH
OF A DISASTER, WAS IT?

04:50.023 --> 04:52.693
YOU KNOW...

04:52.726 --> 04:55.396
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING
THEY FOUND IN HER HOME.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.698
NOT MY YEARBOOK...

04:57.731 --> 04:59.032
NOPE.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.668
JUST SOME STUFF
THAT COULD CAUSE

05:00.701 --> 05:03.837
SEVERE NAUSEA AND PERMANENT
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION...

05:03.871 --> 05:07.040
AND WHICH PROVES THAT
YOUR MOM IS DOING THE HELP.

05:07.074 --> 05:11.679
ACCORDING TO HER DIARY, IT'S
SOME CONTRACTOR NAMED JESUS...

05:11.712 --> 05:15.616
WHICH, GRANTED, WAS ORIGINALLY
A JEWISH NAME, BUT...

05:15.649 --> 05:18.486
GO, MOM.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.395
SO...

05:27.428 --> 05:30.364
WHY WERE YOU TAKING
A MEXICAN FOLK REMEDY?

05:30.398 --> 05:33.100
A FRIEND USES IT.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.502
A FRIEND?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.504
MOM...

05:36.537 --> 05:38.806
JUST FOR MEDICAL REASONS,
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.007
IF YOU'RE SEXUALLY ACTIVE--

05:40.040 --> 05:44.445
AT MY AGE, HE'S MORE
THE ACTIVE ONE.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.713
MOM'S HAVING A FLING.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
I KNOW.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.616
YOU DO?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.951
SHE'S BEEN GIVING ME
LOUSY ADVICE ABOUT IT

05:50.984 --> 05:52.986
FOR FIVE YEARS.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.988
I HAVE PHYSICAL NEEDS.
HE'S A MARRIED MAN, MOM.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.156
SHE DOESN'T WANT SEX
WITH HIM.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.925
I DO WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.092
TELL ME,
WHO'S BEING HURT?

05:59.126 --> 06:01.128
HOLD ON.
FIVE YEARS?

06:01.161 --> 06:03.631
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.734
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.474
DOES THAT REALLY
SURPRISE YOU?

06:18.446 --> 06:21.449
YOU SAID YOU HAD TWO GUYS
HELPING YOU MOVE.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.116
THEY COULDN'T GET
OUT OF WORK.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.153
I'M TRYING
TO ECONOMIZE.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.789
THIS HOTEL'S CHEAP.
[knock on door]

06:28.822 --> 06:29.757
HI.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.092
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANTED
TO DROP OFF SOME MAIL

06:32.125 --> 06:33.727
AND TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.095
OF COURSE.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.840
RACHE...

06:46.874 --> 06:50.511
CHRIS,
THAT'S NOT WHY.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.515
WE GOT TO MOVE ON.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.650
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:56.684 --> 07:00.153
HAVE YOU MOVED ON?

07:00.187 --> 07:01.822
WITH WHO?
IS IT PHIL?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.123
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.727
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT MONEY.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.062
YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.
YEAH,

07:09.096 --> 07:10.631
WHICH YOU
COULD HAVE GLEANED

07:10.664 --> 07:12.165
FROM, "I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS."

07:12.199 --> 07:14.835
I GOT YOU A TRYOUT

07:14.868 --> 07:17.971
TO BE A PART-TIME MEDICAL
CONSULTANT ON LAWSUITS.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.874
WAIT, WITH YOUR BROTHER?

07:20.908 --> 07:23.811
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.046
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.048
JAMIE HAD JUST FOUND OUT
THAT YOU'D BEEN CHEATING ON ME

07:28.081 --> 07:29.583
WITH YOUR PARTNER'S
DAUGHTER.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.084
IT'S A LITTLE OVERREACTION.
MY--

07:31.118 --> 07:33.086
HE BROKE MY NOSE
AND THEN CALLED ME

07:33.120 --> 07:36.089
THE MOST HORRIBLE PERSON
HE'S EVER MET.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.528
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BROKEN
YOUR NOSE.

08:00.213 --> 08:04.184
YOU KNOW, TEXTS,
CALLS, AND EMAILS

08:04.217 --> 08:06.587
ALL GO TO THE SAME MAGIC DEVICE
THESE DAYS.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.221
YOU ONLY GOT TO SEND ONE.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.857
THEN IT'S EVEN WEIRDER

08:09.890 --> 08:11.825
IT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO GET DOWN HERE.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.728
YEAH, THAT'S
A CRAZY MYSTERY.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.864
IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT
A DEPARTMENT TO RUN.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.902
THIS OTHER MAGIC DEVICE
TELLS ME THAT LEAD POISONING

08:21.935 --> 08:25.105
WOULDN'T CAUSE
ALL MY SYMPTOMS.
TRUE.

08:25.138 --> 08:30.210
BUT IT COULD CAUSE
THE 5% THAT ARE REAL.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.846
YOU THINK
I'M A HYPOCHONDRIAC?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.282
WELL, LET ME ANSWER THIS WAY--
MAYBE YOU'RE IMAGINING

08:35.315 --> 08:37.050
THAT I THINK
YOU'RE A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.554
LOOK, MY HAND
JUST STARTED TO SHAKE.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.290
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT
OF THESE ARTHRITIS PILLS.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.725
READ THE LABEL.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
I DID...
WHEN I WAS TYPING IT UP,

08:47.260 --> 08:50.631
RIGHT BEFORE I SLAPPED IT
ON A BOTTLE OF SUGAR PILLS.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.234
YOU PRINTED
A FAKE LABEL...

08:54.267 --> 08:56.737
JUST TO PROVE
I'M A HYPOCHONDRIAC?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.005
DID IT WORK?

08:58.038 --> 09:02.242
IT GOT YOU FIRED,
YOU SCHMUCK.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.115
AN HOUR TO CONVINCE HER
TO GO WITH DR. KAUFMAN,

09:08.148 --> 09:11.318
AND ONLY THEN BECAUSE
HE RUNS INTERNAL MEDICINE.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.886
SHE WANTED TO LEAVE
THE HOSPITAL ENTIRELY.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.122
MY GOD, A WOMAN
GETTING BETTER

09:15.155 --> 09:16.690
WANTS TO LEAVE
THE HOSPITAL?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.325
IF SHE'S GETTING BETTER,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE

09:18.358 --> 09:20.293
YOU MADE HER FEEL
LIKE A FOOL.
IT COULDN'T BE
MORE BECAUSE.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.795
IF I HADN'T,
SHE'D HAVE DIAGNOSED HERSELF

09:21.829 --> 09:23.063
WITH SIX NEW FORMS
OF CANCER.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.331
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.333
IT'S HARD ENOUGH DEALING
WITH MY MOM BEING SICK.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.237
THIS JUVENILE--
[cell phone rings]

09:30.270 --> 09:31.805
YEAH?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.240
LISA, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.142
BUT SHE'S IN A-FIB AT 170.
(Cuddy)
OH, GOD.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.611
I THINK WE SHOULD CARDIOVERT
WHILE SHE'S UNSEDATED.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.279
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.650
A-FIB'S AT 170.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.951
WAIT.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.653
I'M SORRY SHE'S SICK.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.254
I'M NOT SORRY
I'M OFF THE CASE.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.355
YOU'RE NOT OFF THE CASE.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.858
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN CONVINCE HER--

09:50.891 --> 09:52.826
NO, NO.
YOU ARE STAYING ON.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.863
SHE JUST CAN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.204
TOP OF THE MORNING,
DR. KAUFMAN.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.073
HERE'S THE DEAL.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.741
YOU COPY ME
ON ALL THE IMAGING.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.644
I'LL HAVE MY GUYS RUN
THE LAB TESTS.
NO.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.879
I THOUGHT YOU SPOKE
TO CUDDY.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.081
YEAH. THEN I SPOKE
TO THE ELDER CUDDY,

10:14.114 --> 10:17.718
WHO SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED
YOU NOT BE INVOLVED.

10:17.751 --> 10:21.088
LISTEN, KAUFFY,
YOU ARE PERFECTLY COMPETENT,

10:21.121 --> 10:22.289
BORDERING
ON GOOD, EVEN.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.091
BUT YOU KNOW I'M BETTER.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.392
IF YOU WANT,
WE CAN PRETEND IT'S 'CAUSE

10:25.425 --> 10:27.094
I GOT A TEAM
AND MORE RESOURCES.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.062
EITHER WAY, IT'D BE CRAZY
TO IGNORE MY ADVICE.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.898
IT'S NOT GONNA STOP
AT ADVICE.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.299
YOU'RE GONNA START
CUTTING ME OUT,

10:32.332 --> 10:33.901
GO BEHIND ME
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.902
AND IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG,

10:34.935 --> 10:37.738
STILL ME STANDING UP THERE
ALONE AT THE M&M.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.039
PLEASE...

10:39.072 --> 10:41.408
STAY AWAY
FROM MY PATIENT.

10:47.815 --> 10:48.916
(Arlene's voice on tape)
WHICH BUTTON?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.117
(Cuddy)
THE ONE BY YOUR RIGHT HAND

10:50.150 --> 10:52.753
WITH THE DESIGN OF THE BED
NEXT TO IT AND THE ARROWS

10:52.786 --> 10:54.287
POINTING UP OR DOWN.
YOU BUGGED THE ROOM?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.758
I ABSOLUTELY,
WITHOUT APOLOGY, WILL ADMIT

10:57.791 --> 10:59.960
THAT SOMEONE MAY HAVE
ALLEGEDLY DONE SO.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.094
GUESS WE CAN PASS
UNETHICAL

11:01.128 --> 11:03.697
AND SKIP STRAIGHT
TO ILLEGAL.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
NOT ACCORDING TO THE RECENT
SUPREME COURT CASE

11:05.766 --> 11:07.234
OF BITE VERSUS ME.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.802
(Arlene)
DR. KAUFMAN'S SINGLE.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.403
DID YOU KNOW HE WENT
TO HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL?

11:10.437 --> 11:13.974
(Cuddy)
MOM, STOP YENTA-ING
FOR ONE MINUTE!

11:14.007 --> 11:16.143
(Arlene)
IF YOU WANT GLOOMY
AND UNABLE TO COMMIT,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.845
THEN STICK
WITH THE GOYISHE ONE.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.980
THIS IS COMPLETELY UNETHICAL.
WHY ARE WE LISTENING TO THIS?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
I KNOW I'M A PAIN,
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

11:22.049 --> 11:24.718
FOR ME TO WORK WITH YOU
IF YOU--
FINE, FINE!

11:24.752 --> 11:26.854
INSTEAD OF A LIVE STREAM,
I'LL GET A RECAP FROM CUDDY

11:26.887 --> 11:28.989
20 MINUTES LATER--
THANK YOU FOR SAVING AMERICA.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.191
COULD BE LEUKEMIA.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.993
ANEMIA FROM
TAKING OVER THE MARROW,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.029
A-FIB FROM INFILTRATING
CARDIAC MUSCLE.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.431
SOUNDS GOOD.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.134
YEAH.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.137
I WAS REALLY HOPING
FOR A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS--

11:44.171 --> 11:46.473
ONE THAT KAUFMAN HADN'T
ALREADY COME UP WITH.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.976
HE JUST STARTED
A BONE-MARROW BIOPSY.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.178
SO WE DON'T NEED
TO DO ANYTHING.
I DON'T.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.380
YOU DO. GO TO ADMITTING.
FIND US A NEW CASE.

12:00.988 --> 12:04.057
[whistles softly]

12:04.091 --> 12:06.459
PSST! WHAA!

12:12.165 --> 12:13.533
DDX.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.135
UM, WE JUST DID IT.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.170
NO, WE JUST DID
THE FAKE ONE.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.439
WHY DO YOU THINK I LET THE
TRUTH FAIRY KNOW ABOUT THE BUG?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.809
I WAS TESTING HER.
SHE FAILED.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.176
SHE'S STILL A NARC.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.079
THIAMINE DEFICIENCY
FITS BETTER THAN LEUKEMIA.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.515
YOU THINK SHE'S
AN ALCOHOLIC?

12:28.548 --> 12:31.318
I HAD DINNER WITH ARLENE.
I MIXED HER A GIN AND TONIC.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.854
AND I'D RUN
OUT OF THE TONIC,

12:33.887 --> 12:35.455
SO I SUBSTITUTED
SLEEPING PILLS.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.157
NEXT MORNING,
SHE ASSUMED

12:37.190 --> 12:39.827
THE BLACKOUT WAS
FROM THE DRINKING.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.830
HOW MANY OLD LADIES ARE USED
TO PASSING OUT FROM BOOZING?

12:42.863 --> 12:46.499
THE ANSWER IS THE BOOZERS.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.469
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLIP HER
THE THIAMINE PILLS.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.942
WE'VE GOT TO RUN THIS
BY CUDDY.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.112
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M IN SUCH A BAD MOOD?

13:04.217 --> 13:07.420
ALCOHOLIC?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.258
TREATMENT'S VERY EASY,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.260
SAFE.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.863
IT'S LITERALLY
A FEW VITAMIN PILLS.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.097
IT'LL FIX HER HEART,

13:17.130 --> 13:20.300
AND IT WON'T INTERFERE WITH
THE BIOPSY KAUFMAN'S RUNNING.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.904
PUT 'EM
IN AN ANTACID BOTTLE.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.206
JUST TELL HER
IT'S FOR STOMACH PROBLEMS.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.580
I HAVE TO ASK HER
ABOUT THIS.

13:33.613 --> 13:37.084
OF COURSE.
ABSOLUTELY.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.218
YOU'LL ASK.
SHE'LL DENY.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.153
YOU'LL PUSH IT.
SHE'LL GET OFFENDED.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.388
YOU'LL BE EXACTLY
WHERE YOU ARE NOW,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.156
EXCEPT IT'LL BE
HARDER TO TREAT.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.424
YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY
GOT TO DO THAT.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.893
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL LIE TO ME.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.929
SHE JUST SPENT
THE LAST FIVE YEARS

13:48.962 --> 13:51.598
GOING SOUTH OF THE BORDER
DOWN MEXICO WAY.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.967
WE HAVE OUR ISSUES,
BUT SINCE DAD DIED,

13:54.001 --> 13:58.105
WE TELL EACH OTHER THE TRUTH
WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.441
IT'S IMPORTANT TO US.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.346
ADDICTS LIE.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.162
CAN I SPEAK
TO MOM ALONE?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.365
WHY?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.239
YOU'RE SCARING ME,
LISA.

14:32.272 --> 14:36.376
MOM, I THINK YOUR DRINKING
IS CAUSING YOUR HEART PROBLEMS.

14:36.409 --> 14:40.213
IS THIS ABOUT THE CHAMPAGNE?
SHE ORDERED--

14:41.581 --> 14:45.118
PATSY AND ANNE
TOLD ME LAST WEEK

14:45.152 --> 14:47.354
YOU LOST CONTROL
AT THE MUSEUM LUNCHEON.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.656
YOU'RE TALKING TO MY FRIENDS
BEHIND MY BACK.

14:49.689 --> 14:53.293
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED.
JUST TELL ME HONESTLY...

14:53.326 --> 14:55.262
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU
BEEN DRINKING?

14:57.530 --> 15:02.002
I MAY BE YOUR PATIENT,
BUT I AM STILL YOUR MOTHER.

15:02.035 --> 15:05.505
AND I'M TELLING YOU
I AM NOT A DRUNK.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.614
OKAY.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.128
FOR YOUR STOMACH PAINS.

15:51.584 --> 15:55.522
IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT
COMES UP AGAIN, JUST...

15:55.555 --> 15:57.157
DO WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.592
AND KEEP YOU OUT OF IT?
YEAH.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.362
I AM BEING A COWARD,

16:02.395 --> 16:04.364
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY
DOCTORS SHOULDN'T TREAT

16:04.397 --> 16:06.099
THEIR OWN FAMILIES.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.700
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.403
YOU WERE RIGHT,
AS USUAL.

16:13.606 --> 16:17.377
THE HITTING YOU
WAS NOT OPTIMAL.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.113
I WAS GOING THROUGH
MY OWN DIVORCE AT THE TIME.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.015
I HAVE HAD YEARS
OF THERAPY.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.116
NOW WHEN I GET MAD,

16:23.150 --> 16:26.353
I DO SOME DEEP BREATHING,
SQUEEZE MY STRESS BALL.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.489
HEY, I KIND OF
DESERVED IT.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.724
THAT'S FOR SURE.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.660
HERE'S THE DEAL.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.163
I DO A LOT
OF MED-MAL INSURANCE.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.664
I NEED A NEW
NON-TESTIFYING EXPERT.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.432
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE CASE
AS A TRYOUT.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.667
YOU KICK ASS,
I PUT YOU ON RETAINER.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.803
AVERAGE 15 HOURS A WEEK,
IT'S 50 A YEAR.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.139
50 WHAT?

16:46.173 --> 16:49.176
YOU KIDDING?
$50,000.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.211
I'LL TAKE IT.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.313
YOU DRIVE A SOFT BARGAIN.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.248
YOU GOT TO SIGN
AN N.D.A.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.449
SURE.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.385
IS THIS...?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.520
UH, THAT'S A CASE
I'M ABOUT TO SETTLE.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.290
I REP A GIANT
PIZZA-DELIVERY COMPANY.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.592
DRIVER HIT THAT KID,
MESSED UP HIS LEGS.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.428
AND GAVE HIM A MICROBLEED
IN HIS BRAIN, RIGHT?

17:08.461 --> 17:11.198
WHAT? NO.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.332
THIS LITTLE WHITE MARK.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.469
YOUR PREDECESSOR CHECKED,
SO DID THE KID'S DOCTORS.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.506
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT HE'S FINE.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.609
PROBABLY.
BUT IF THERE'S ANY DOUBT--

17:22.642 --> 17:24.211
IT'S A
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR CASE.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.578
WE'RE SETTLING
IN TWO DAYS.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.480
LAY OFF IT, OKAY?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.549
OKAY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.818
I'M OFF.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.425
[elevator bell dings]

17:43.463 --> 17:45.432
SHE SPIKED A FEVER.
IT'S 102.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.802
THAT MEANS I WAS WRONG
ABOUT THE THIAMINE DEFICIENCY.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.804
YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT THE ALCOHOLISM.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.640
TRUE DAT.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.309
IT'S ACTUALLY LOOKING
MORE AND MORE LIKE LEUKEMIA.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.712
KAUFMAN RUSHED THE BIOPSIES.
IT'S NOT CANCER.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.515
SO THERE'S
A BRIGHT SIDE...

18:02.549 --> 18:05.385
KAUFMAN WAS WRONG TOO.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.330
DDX.
(Chase)
OKAY...

18:17.364 --> 18:19.232
WHAT DISEASE CAN TURN
CUDDY'S MOTHER

18:19.266 --> 18:21.768
INTO A COMA PATIENT
NAMED STEWART?

18:21.801 --> 18:22.702
LUPUS?

18:24.904 --> 18:27.774
WE GOT FIRED FROM THAT CASE.
WE'RE MOVING ON.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.310
(Taub)
WE WERE ALREADY FIRED.
BY THE PATIENT.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.245
THIS TIME BY CUDDY,
SO IT'S REAL.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.215
SHE SOMEHOW REALIZED THAT
HER COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE SYSTEM

18:35.248 --> 18:37.217
WAS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.652
OKAY, POP QUIZ,
HOT SHOTS--

18:39.686 --> 18:41.588
I CHOSE VEGETABLE STEW
FOR A REASON.

18:41.621 --> 18:46.426
YOU GOT 60 SECONDS,
NO "HINTSIES."

18:46.459 --> 18:47.594
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TALK TO US?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.329
EXACTLY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO--HEY!

18:49.362 --> 18:50.730
YOU'RE GOOD.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.899
SO THIS IS JUST A TEST?

18:52.932 --> 18:54.934
(Foreman)
PUPILS FIXED AND DILATED--

18:54.967 --> 18:56.736
AN ADDICT,

18:56.769 --> 18:59.672
FOUND WITH AN EMPTY BOTTLE
OF PHENOBARB NEXT TO HIM.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.775
HOW IS THIS A MYSTERY?
IT'S AN OVERDOSE.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.643
GLUTETHIMIDE!

19:03.676 --> 19:05.645
SCRIPT FILLED LAST YEAR.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.481
COULD MIMIC FIXED AND DILATED
WITHOUT THE BRAIN DEATH...

19:08.515 --> 19:11.351
EXCEPT HE'LL JUST GET BETTER
ON HIS OWN,

19:11.384 --> 19:13.486
SO WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
THIS CASE?

19:13.520 --> 19:14.787
BECAUSE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE TREATMENT

19:14.821 --> 19:16.456
AS LONG AS THE CASE
IS INTERESTING.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.558
I'LL DO A BLOOD DRAW

19:18.591 --> 19:21.294
AND PUT GLUTETHIMIDE
ON THE TOX SCREEN.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.600
(House)
REALLY?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.370
YOU THOUGHT THAT CASE
WAS INTERESTING?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.572
OH, GUESS WE'RE STILL
ON ARLENE.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.641
AREN'T THERE OTHER WAYS
OF KEEPING MASTERS OCCUPIED?

19:34.674 --> 19:37.677
NOT ACCORDING TO MY
SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEMINAR.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.649
MAYBE IT'S NOT HYPOCHONDRIA.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.317
SHE SAID SHE GETS
A LOT OF RASHES.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.418
ADD THE FEVER--

19:45.452 --> 19:47.954
SOUNDS LIKE
AUTOIMMUNE, S.L.E.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.323
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU CAN THINK EXACTLY LIKE

19:50.357 --> 19:52.259
A SEMI-COMPETENT
INTERNIST.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.661
KAUFMAN'S STARTING HER
ON PREDNISONE.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.663
BUT THE HEART PROBLEMS
WERE FIRST.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.998
ENDOCARDITIS.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.533
WITH NO MURMURS?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.669
IT'S USUALLY A LATE SIGN.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.736
ECHO SHOWED
PRISTINE VALVES.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.305
BELOW THE RESOLVING
THRESHOLD.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.006
KAUFMAN'S PREDNISONE

20:07.039 --> 20:09.776
WILL SUPPRESS HER
IMMUNE SYSTEM--COULD KILL HER.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.315
YOU GOT TO TELL HIM
IT'S ENDOCARDITIS.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.416
CHECK THE WIRETAP.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.951
HIS I.D. GUY'S BEEN PUTTING
THE SAME ARGUMENT TO HIM.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.621
HE CAN'T CONVINCE HIM.
YOU THINK I GOT A BETTER SHOT?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.822
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

20:27.894 --> 20:30.363
WE SWITCH HER MEDS.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.831
WE GET A SOLUTION
OF BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS,

20:31.864 --> 20:35.302
STICK IT IN AN I.V. BAG
MARKED FOR PREDNISONE.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.036
KAUFMAN CAN ONLY BE THERE
A FEW TIMES A DAY.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.539
TELL ARLENE YOU'RE FROM
THE PHARMACY, SWITCH 'EM OUT.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.941
THIS IS NUTS.
THIS IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.410
IT'S HANGING AN I.V. BAG!

20:43.443 --> 20:44.777
IF THE ATTENDING
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S ON,

20:44.811 --> 20:46.313
THE RISK
OF DRUG REACTION--
WHAT RISK?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.281
WE KNOW HOW HE'S TREATING HER.
WE BUGGED THE ROOM.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.582
(Foreman)
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT INFORMATION!

20:49.616 --> 20:51.618
WE'RE TALKING ETHICAL
AND LEGAL VIOLATIONS

20:51.651 --> 20:53.320
ON A SCALE THAT SHOULD MAKE
EVEN YOU PUKE!

20:53.353 --> 20:55.488
SHE'S DYING!
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE SHOULD ALL GO TO JAIL

20:55.522 --> 20:56.756
TO SAVE HER!

21:02.795 --> 21:06.333
YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL
BECAUSE...

21:06.366 --> 21:09.902
THIS IS YOUR
GIRLFRIEND'S MOM.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.772
YOU GONNA RUN THIS
BY CUDDY?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.073
NO.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.309
SHE SAID TO
KEEP HER OUT OF IT,

21:16.343 --> 21:17.544
DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.745
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING

21:18.778 --> 21:20.847
IS COMPLETELY SCREWED UP.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.948
THAT'S BECAUSE
THIS SITUATION

21:21.981 --> 21:23.816
IS COMPLETELY SCREWED UP.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.953
DO IT, OR YOU'RE FIRED.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.993
WE STICK TOGETHER,
HE CAN'T FIRE ALL THREE OF US.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.697
GIVE ME A PRESCRIPTION PAD.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.632
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.000
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S ENDOCARDITIS,

21:41.033 --> 21:43.836
AND I THINK THE PREDNISONE
WILL KILL HER.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.573
NOW, I FORGOT
MY PRESCRIPTION PAD.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.918
(Taub)
AM I A HORRIBLE PERSON?

21:58.951 --> 22:02.021
I USED TO WIN AWARDS
FOR VOLUNTEER WORK.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.824
I WENT TO GUATEMALA
AND FIXED CLEFT PALATES.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.026
NOW WE'RE SITTING BACK
LETTING CHASE

22:07.059 --> 22:09.762
DO OUR DIRTY WORK.
WE'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING--

22:09.796 --> 22:11.798
STAY OUT OF IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.801
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE.

22:14.834 --> 22:19.005
THEN THIS THING WITH THE KID,
RACHEL'S BROTHER--

22:19.038 --> 22:20.607
STAY OUT OF THAT TOO.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.743
A--RADIOLOGISTS--EXPERTS,
UNLIKE YOU--SAID NO BLEED.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.578
B--YOU YOURSELF SAID
IT'S PROBABLY NOT.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.914
C--YOU'VE GOT
NO DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.749
D--YOU'LL LOSE
YOUR CONSULTING JOB.

22:29.782 --> 22:30.983
E--YOUR EX WILL KILL YOU.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.120
F--I'M RUNNING
OUT OF ALPHABET HERE.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.956
YOU DO IT?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.958
HAD THE BAG,
WALKING TOWARDS THE ROOM,

22:38.991 --> 22:41.694
AND CUDDY'S SISTER SAYS,
"HEY, DR. CHASE."

22:41.728 --> 22:43.796
I MET HER AT
THAT CHARITY EVENT LAST YEAR.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.131
ONE OF YOU TWO
HAS GOT TO DO THIS.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.500
I MET ARLENE
AT THE SAME BENEFIT.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.901
(Taub)
CONVENIENTLY.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.803
COME ON, DON'T ASK ME.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.672
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I BELIEVE IT'S ENDO--

22:52.705 --> 22:53.906
[cell phone rings]

22:53.940 --> 22:55.908
DAMN IT.
IT'S RACHEL'S BROTHER.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.777
HE WANTS ME TO CHECK OUT
SOME NEW CASE.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.813
CONVENIENTLY.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.883
IT'S A TRYOUT.
I NEED THIS JOB.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.686
I GOT TO DO THIS.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.054
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
DITCH US, RUN OFF,

23:08.087 --> 23:09.589
AND WORK
ON SOME OTHER CASE?

23:14.661 --> 23:17.664
[knock on door,
doorbell rings]

23:21.233 --> 23:22.969
ARE YOU TIMOTHY'S MOM?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.971
YEAH.
MY NAME
IS CHRISTOPHER TAUB.

23:25.004 --> 23:28.174
I'M A DOCTOR
AT PRINCETON PLAINSBORO.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.776
I SAW YOUR SON'S FILE.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.545
I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
A VERY SMALL BLEED IN HIS BRAIN.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.014
WAIT, YOU--
YOU SAW HIS FILE?

23:35.047 --> 23:37.049
H-HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO WE ARE? I--

23:37.083 --> 23:39.852
YOUR SON COULD DIE
OF A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.654
HE NEEDS A CEREBRAL
ANGIOGRAM TODAY.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.423
GET IN YOUR CAR AND MEET ME
AT THE HOSPITAL.

23:46.893 --> 23:50.530
TIMOTHY, WE'RE GONNA GO SEE
THE DOCTOR.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.737
(House)
ANOTHER POP QUIZ.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.107
HOW MANY IDIOT DOCTORS
DOES IT TAKE TO SWITCH AN I.V.?

24:01.140 --> 24:04.010
THE LONGER WE WAIT,

24:04.043 --> 24:06.746
THE MORE THE PREDNISONE
IS GONNA KILL HER IMMUNE SYSTEM.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.814
FORGET PLAYING PHARMACIST.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.016
MOM NAPS EVERY AFTERNOON.
WAIT BY THE ROOM.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.519
WHEN SHE FALLS ASLEEP,
GET THE SISTER OUT SOMEHOW.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.721
[door opens]

24:14.754 --> 24:18.558
[knock at door]

24:18.591 --> 24:20.760
HI, DR. CUDDY, IS NOW
A GOOD TIME TO TALK?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.729
NOT REALLY.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.764
SO, UM, YOU KNOW
HOW YOU HAD US CONSULTING

24:24.797 --> 24:26.799
AND THEN STOPPED
HAVING US CONSULT?

24:26.833 --> 24:29.101
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

24:29.135 --> 24:31.003
UM, WELL,
I THINK THE STOPPING

24:31.037 --> 24:33.706
MIGHT HAVE STOPPED.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.508
HOUSE PUT ME
ON THIS WEIRD CASE

24:35.542 --> 24:37.009
WHERE THERE'S
NO TREATMENT--

24:37.043 --> 24:38.978
I THINK MAYBE
TO DISTRACT ME.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.880
UH, AND THEY'VE BEEN
ACTING ODD.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.749
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.784
THANK YOU
FOR COMING TO ME.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.219
BECAUSE I'M--I'M WORRIED
THAT HE'S SWITCHING

24:47.253 --> 24:49.756
YOUR MOTHER'S MEDICATIONS.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.258
I CHECKED
WITH THE PHARMACY--

24:52.291 --> 24:54.927
DR. CHASE GOT PREDNISONE
AND ANTIBIOTICS

24:54.961 --> 24:57.029
FOR MY COMA PATIENT,
WHICH WOULDN'T TREAT HIM,

24:57.063 --> 24:59.966
BUT COULD TREAT CONDITIONS
THAT CAUSE...

24:59.999 --> 25:03.202
HEART FAILURE.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.976
YOU TOLD ME TO KEEP YOU OUT
OF IT, DO WHAT I NEEDED TO DO.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.978
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU THINK THAT MEANT?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.680
I MEANT, LIKE, IF YOU HAD
TO SLIP HER

25:13.713 --> 25:14.781
A FEW MORE VITAMIN PILLS
OR SOMETHING.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.248
THIS IS LIFE-THREATENING!

25:16.282 --> 25:18.117
IT'S ILLEGAL.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.819
I WASN'T EXPECTING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.654
ONLY BECAUSE YOU INTENTIONALLY
WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT IT

25:21.688 --> 25:24.724
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE
ANY TOUGH DECISIONS.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.996
ARE YOU COMPLETELY SURE
IT'S ENDOCARDITIS?

25:32.331 --> 25:33.900
THAT'S NOT
A REAL QUESTION.

25:33.933 --> 25:38.004
ENDOCARDITIS FITS
BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES.

25:43.910 --> 25:48.047
WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE
HANGING THE RIGHT I.V.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.050
THE FASTEST WAY IS
WITH YOU HELP.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.997
(Cuddy)
WHERE'D JULIA GO?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.032
SHE'S GOT A FAMILY.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.900
I'VE GOT A FAMILY.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.604
THREE KIDS AND A HUSBAND--
THAT'S A FAMILY.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.840
YOU WERE ALWAYS TOUGHER
ON ME THAN JULIA.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.142
WHY IS THAT?
I'M NOT.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.812
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHEN YOU MADE ME RUN

26:19.846 --> 26:22.014
FOR YEARBOOK EDITOR--
I DIDN'T WANT TO.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.916
I DIDN'T HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE
MY WHOLE SENIOR YEAR.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.618
YOU LET JULIA DO
WHATEVER SHE WANTED.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.954
WE'RE DEBATING
12TH GRADE NOW?

26:27.987 --> 26:30.089
LIKE ANYTHING'S CHANGED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
LISA?

26:30.122 --> 26:33.259
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
I LOVE YOU BOTH THE SAME?

26:33.292 --> 26:35.728
OF COURSE I DO.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.699
OKAY.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.268
BUT TIMES LIKE THIS,

26:42.301 --> 26:45.638
WHEN WE ARGUE,
IT REMINDS ME...

26:45.672 --> 26:47.974
I HAVE MORE IN COMMON
WITH HER.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.910
SHE'S NICER TO ME.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.112
I LOVE YOU BOTH...

26:55.014 --> 26:58.017
BUT I LIKE HER
MORE THAN YOU.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.134
[door closes]

27:15.167 --> 27:18.237
I CALLED YOU
THREE TIMES.
MY PHONE WASN'T
EXACTLY ON.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.306
I FIGURE I'LL BE GETTING
SOME ANGRY CALLS

27:20.339 --> 27:21.974
ONCE RADIOLOGY SENDS BACK
THE ANGIOGRAM.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.911
THEY ALREADY DID.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.846
HERE...

27:26.879 --> 27:29.248
THIS IS WHAT YOU SAW.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.317
IT'S AN ANATOMICAL VARIANT
OF THE SKULL--

27:31.350 --> 27:34.186
THE BONE IN PROXIMITY
TO A BLOOD VESSEL.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.088
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG
WITH HIM.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.692
THAT WAS REASON "G."

27:41.060 --> 27:44.296
THAT'S GOOD NEWS
FOR HIM.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.036
[wheezing]

27:51.804 --> 27:53.339
LUNGS CLEAR?
DIFFUSE WHEEZING,

27:53.372 --> 27:55.875
TIGHTNESS, PRURITIS.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.777
IT'S AN ALLERGIC REACTION.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.246
LOOKS LIKE.
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.848
SHE'S ON PREDNISONE.

28:01.881 --> 28:06.085
HOW COULD SHE GET
AN ALLERGIC REACTION?

28:09.488 --> 28:10.556
I SWITCHED OUT
THE ANTIBIOTICS,

28:10.589 --> 28:12.424
PUT HER BACK ON PREDNISONE--
HER BREATHING'S NORMAL.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.927
BUT THE A-FIB'S BACK,
AND HER FEVER'S UP.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.428
ALLERGY'S GOT TO BE DUE
TO OUR ANTIBIOTICS.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.230
(House)
DOES KAUFMAN KNOW
WHAT WE DID?

28:18.264 --> 28:20.399
THAT'S GOOD.
NO, THAT IS TERRIBLE!

28:20.432 --> 28:23.803
HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
SHE GOT WORSE ON ANTIBIOTICS,

28:23.836 --> 28:25.137
SO NOW HE'S THINKING
ENDOCARDITIS.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.338
HE'LL PUT HER BACK
ON THE ANTIBIOTICS

28:26.372 --> 28:27.339
THAT ALMOST SUFFOCATED HER.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.841
WHAT DO WE DO?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.845
WE PUSH THROUGH THIS.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.915
IT STARTED IN THE HEART.
ENDOCARDITIS STILL FITS.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.249
IT'S JUST GOT
TO BE FUNGAL.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.384
WE HAVE TO SWITCH
KAUFMAN'S ANTIBIOTICS

28:38.417 --> 28:39.385
FOR AMPHOTERICIN "B."

28:39.418 --> 28:41.821
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T CARE.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.022
BUT WE ARE GONNA END UP
KILLING THIS WOMAN

28:43.055 --> 28:44.390
IF WE KEEP CONFUSING
HER ATTENDING

28:44.423 --> 28:46.959
WITH THESE SECRET MEDS.
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT CONFUSING THE ATTENDING!

28:46.993 --> 28:48.027
I WANT THIS WOMAN--

28:48.060 --> 28:50.797
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
SIMPLE ANTIBIOTICS ANYMORE.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.866
AMPHOTERICIN "B"
IS DANGEROUS IN ITSELF.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.935
IT'S A POISON.
THAT'S WHY IT KILLS FUNGI.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.770
IT'LL GIVE HER FEVER, CHILLS--
WHICH SHE ALREADY HAS,

28:57.804 --> 28:58.670
WHICH WILL HELP US
HIDE IT.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.306
I DON'T THINK I CAN TAKE
A RISK LIKE THAT.

29:00.339 --> 29:03.242
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HER FIRE ME!

29:07.213 --> 29:10.817
LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SWITCH THE I.V.s AGAIN.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.786
THIS HAS BLOWN UP ON YOU
ONCE ALREADY.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.154
HE'S RIGHT.
YEP.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.893
I'M SO SORRY
I GOT YOU GUYS INTO THIS.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.094
YOU SHOULD GO.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.538
I'M RIGHT.
I KNOW.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.875
AND I'LL DO IT, BUT--

29:48.921 --> 29:52.925
I AGREE.
FUNGAL ENDOCARDITIS FITS.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.429
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.534
(Masters)
I DON'T WANT TO TELL HER,
NOT AT ALL.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.971
BUT THE PATIENT
IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

30:05.004 --> 30:08.908
I'M KICKING YOU
OUT OF YOUR OFFICE.

30:08.941 --> 30:12.444
YES, YOU.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.113
THIS IS NOT HER OFFICE YET.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.827
[door closes]

30:34.166 --> 30:35.968
IF YOU TELL ANYONE,

30:36.002 --> 30:39.471
I WILL GET YOU THROWN
OUT OF MED SCHOOL,

30:39.505 --> 30:44.010
AND I WILL DESTROY
YOUR CAREER.

30:45.978 --> 30:50.950
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.953
LYING ABOUT ME...

30:53.986 --> 30:55.922
WON'T WORK.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.457
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOUR REPUTATION.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.292
TRUE...

31:00.326 --> 31:02.494
BUT I WON'T HAVE TO LIE.

31:02.528 --> 31:06.966
BURIED IN YOUR COMA PATIENT'S
BIG, BIG FILE

31:06.999 --> 31:09.635
IS A FORM
THAT DOESN'T ALLOW TREATMENT

31:09.668 --> 31:13.105
WITHOUT THE EXPRESSED
CONSENT OF THE RELATIVES.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.210
WAIT...
YOU DREW BLOOD.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.679
AND THAT'S NOT JUST
A SCREWUP.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.082
IT'S CRIMINAL ASSAULT.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.955
BUT YOU TOLD ME--
NO. AS YOU MAY RECALL...

31:35.661 --> 31:37.529
YOU SET ME UP?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.503
WHY?

31:46.038 --> 31:50.042
BECAUSE THIS PATIENT
IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.

32:14.566 --> 32:18.570
[breathing heavily]

32:22.174 --> 32:24.476
[thunder rumbling]

32:31.650 --> 32:33.685
YOU MADE HER THINK
[groaning]

32:33.719 --> 32:35.721
I WAS HIDING HER SON
BEING SICK!

32:35.754 --> 32:38.991
SHE SCUTTLED THE SETTLEMENT.
SHE REPORTED ME TO THE BAR.

32:39.025 --> 32:41.627
I GOT TO DEAL
WITH THAT CRAP NOW.

32:41.660 --> 32:46.098
I WILL SUE YOU FOR SLANDER,
FOR TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE,

32:46.132 --> 32:50.136
AND ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN USE TO DESTROY YOU.

32:50.169 --> 32:54.106
OH, AND MY SISTER SAYS
STAY OUT OF HER LIFE...

32:54.140 --> 32:57.109
YOU FAILURE.

32:57.143 --> 33:00.546
FIVE YEARS OF THERAPY.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.353
[door slides open]

33:07.386 --> 33:09.188
DR. KAUFMAN?

33:09.221 --> 33:13.692
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU
AND THE PATIENT ALONE.

33:16.262 --> 33:19.131
I'M SKIPPING
THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.233
I'M GOING STRAIGHT
TO THE STATE BOARD

33:21.267 --> 33:22.568
AND REPORTING YOU FOR--

33:22.601 --> 33:26.505
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS
SO OFF THE SPECTRUM,

33:26.538 --> 33:28.240
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S
A SPECIFIC NAME FOR IT.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.276
I THINK HE'S TALKING
TO YOU.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.543
(Cuddy)
MARTY, CALM DOWN.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.179
(Kaufman)
AND YOU--WHAT YOU DID
IS WORSE.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.246
HE'S AN INSANE LUNATIC.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.581
YOU'RE THE DEAN
OF MEDICINE!

33:35.614 --> 33:37.349
I WANT YOU OFF MY CASE.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.417
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.352
DON'T GET EXCITED.
YOU'RE FIRED TOO.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.222
WHAT?
I'LL NEVER GET AWAY
FROM HOUSE OR MY DAUGHTER

33:43.255 --> 33:44.556
IF I STAY HERE.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.558
TRANSFER ME
TO PRINCETON GENERAL.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.627
MOM...

33:48.660 --> 33:51.663
YOU'RE VERY ILL,
AND YOU'RE VERY ANGRY.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.399
YOU REALLY THINK NOW

33:53.432 --> 33:55.234
IS THE RIGHT TIME
TO MAKE A DECISION LIKE THIS?

33:55.267 --> 33:58.104
YOU LIED TO ME
AND BETRAYED ME.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.838
DO YOU THINK
I REALLY CARE

33:59.871 --> 34:02.274
WHAT YOU CONSIDER
A GOOD IDEA ANYMORE?

34:06.845 --> 34:08.814
[scoffs]

34:17.356 --> 34:20.126
I'LL GET THE AMBULANCE.

34:23.295 --> 34:26.132
HAPPY?

34:34.740 --> 34:38.310
[crying]
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.582
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

34:43.615 --> 34:46.318
YOU JUST KILLED HER.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.258
ARE YOU BLAMING ME?

34:54.393 --> 34:56.295
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO ARROGANT,

34:56.328 --> 34:58.730
YOU GOADED HER
INTO FIRING YOU!

34:58.764 --> 35:00.732
ACTUALLY, MY MISTAKES STARTED
A LITTLE AFTER THAT,

35:00.766 --> 35:03.135
WHEN I AGREED
TO YOUR BRILLIANT SCHEME

35:03.169 --> 35:04.603
TO KEEP ME ON THE CASE
AFTER SHE'D FIRED ME OFF IT.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.338
SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT
THE HOSPITAL.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.440
ONLY 'CAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE
LET HER, LIKE YOU DID JUST NOW.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.808
YOU THINK
I CAN CONTROL HER?

35:09.841 --> 35:11.510
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU TRY.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.212
I HAVE BEEN REBELLING
AGAINST THIS WOMAN

35:13.245 --> 35:14.480
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.582
HERE'S WHAT I'VE SEEN.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.285
SHE INSULTS YOU,
YOU COMPLAIN TO ME.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.553
I DRUG HER AT DINNER,
YOU NEVER LET HER KNOW.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.555
WE SLIP HER MEDICINE,
HAPPENS BEHIND HER BACK.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.458
YOU NEVER CONFRONT HER...

35:26.492 --> 35:28.860
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.200
ARE YOU TAKING THIS
PERSONALLY?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.802
SHE LEAVES, SHE DIES.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.171
ONE DAY...

35:39.205 --> 35:42.308
MAYBE A WEEK FROM NOW,
MAYBE A YEAR FROM NOW,

35:42.341 --> 35:44.476
YOU'RE GONNA DECIDE THAT
THE MAN SLEEPING NEXT TO YOU

35:44.510 --> 35:48.214
KILLED YOUR MOTHER.

35:50.449 --> 35:55.321
GET ME MY PATIENT BACK.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.225
THIS IS REALLY BAD, LISE.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.160
I SWEAR TO GOD, JULES,
I WILL CALL SECURITY!

36:14.906 --> 36:17.209
I ASKED YOU BEFORE
WHY YOU WERE TOUGH ON ME.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.677
I WASN'T.
YOU WERE.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.612
AND I KNOW WHY.

36:20.646 --> 36:24.850
YOU SEE SOMETHING IN ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE IN JULIA

36:24.883 --> 36:26.385
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE IN YOU--

36:26.418 --> 36:28.887
A TYPE OF AMBITION,
A TYPE OF BRAINS.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.822
THAT'S WHY YOU RODE ME.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.460
YOU MADE ME YEARBOOK EDITOR,
SUMMA UNDERGRAD,

36:34.493 --> 36:36.862
A.O.A. IN MED SCHOOL.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.498
THE ONLY TIME I EVER SEE LIGHT
IN YOUR EYES

36:39.531 --> 36:42.368
IS WHEN YOU HEAR ME TALKING
ABOUT MY JOB.

36:45.737 --> 36:49.408
THE REASON YOU KEEP COMING
TO SEE ME IN THE CLINIC

36:49.441 --> 36:51.410
IS BECAUSE YOU TRUST ME.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.880
YOU TRUST
MY MEDICAL JUDGMENT.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.416
SO HERE IT IS.

36:57.449 --> 37:00.386
IF YOU TRANSFER
TO PRINCETON GENERAL,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.988
YOU'LL BE TREATED WELL,
AND YOU'LL DIE.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.557
IF YOU STAY HERE
WITH HOUSE,

37:05.591 --> 37:09.495
YOU'LL BE TREATED BADLY,
BUT YOU'LL LIVE.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.999
I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE
TO SLASH THE TIRES

37:14.032 --> 37:17.536
OF EVERY AMBULANCE
IN THIS BAY, MOM.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.673
I AM NOT LETTING YOU
LEAVE MY HOSPITAL.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.978
(nurse)
ONE, TWO, THREE.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.648
I GOT IT.
HOW YOU FEELING, MOM?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.383
I FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.385
YOUR HEART'S STILL WEAK
FROM THE INFECTION.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.753
WE'LL HANG
AN ANTIFUNGAL I.V.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.356
IF YOU'RE SO GREAT,
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT RUNNING

37:37.389 --> 37:38.690
YOUR DEPARTMENT ANYMORE?

37:38.724 --> 37:40.459
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, MOM?

37:40.492 --> 37:42.828
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
TWO DAYS AGO,

37:42.861 --> 37:44.596
I SAID THAT I DIDN'T HAVE
A DEPARTMENT TO RUN.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.498
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.600
RIGHT, BECAUSE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TALKING

37:48.634 --> 37:49.968
CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE
BEING SARCASTIC.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.505
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
OF COURSE THEY CAN.

37:53.539 --> 37:54.973
BUT YOU WEREN'T.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.349
I LOVE A-ROD.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.617
HE'S SO MODEST.

38:05.651 --> 38:06.985
AND I HIGHLY RESPECT

38:07.018 --> 38:09.388
THE PAINTINGS HE HAS
OF HIMSELF AS A CENTAUR.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.422
QUESTION--

38:10.456 --> 38:13.325
DO I LIKE A-ROD?

38:13.359 --> 38:16.495
YES...
WHOEVER HE IS.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.565
SHE CAN'T RECOGNIZE
SARCASM?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.500
DEFICIT IN THE RIGHT
PARAHIPPOCAMPAL GYRUS,

38:21.533 --> 38:24.436
WHICH MEANS CNS INVOLVEMENT
BEFORE THE FEVER.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.739
I WAS WRONG
ABOUT THE ENDOCARDITIS.

38:27.773 --> 38:31.577
I-I DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL--

38:31.610 --> 38:32.778
MOM? MOM!

38:32.811 --> 38:36.382
HEART RATE 170.
NURSE!

38:37.483 --> 38:40.552
DO SOMETHING.
I AM.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.721
HOUSE!
THE FEVER
WAS HYPOTHALAMIC.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.691
THAT MEANS BRAIN, HEART,
ANEMIA, ALLERGY.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.092
YOU HEAR THAT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.627
YOU THINK
HEAVY-METAL TOXICITY.
IT CAN'T BE.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.563
YOU TREATED WITH CHELATION
FOR LEAD.
SHE GOT BETTER,
THEN SHE GOT WORSE.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.064
SHE NEVER STOPPED
BEING POISONED.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.603
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO STOP AND EXPLAIN?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.979
[groans]

39:09.114 --> 39:12.050
THERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THAT.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.455
(Cuddy)
THE MUSCLE'S BLACK.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.391
NECROSIS?
METALLOSIS.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.859
HER ARTIFICIAL HIP

39:20.892 --> 39:23.462
"WEARED AND TEARED"
WAY TOO MUCH.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.831
IT'S COBALT POISONING.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.165
WE NEED CHASE
TO GET AN O.R.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.868
I'M GONNA START
CHELATION AGAIN.

39:32.571 --> 39:36.408
[monitor beeping]

39:41.079 --> 39:45.717
[knock on door]

40:00.599 --> 40:02.901
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.937
I DIDN'T.
FOREMAN CALLED ME.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.078
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU THOUGHT

40:13.111 --> 40:16.114
THAT LITTLE BOY HAD
A BLEED IN HIS HEAD.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.587
I WILL KILL MY BROTHER

40:21.620 --> 40:25.524
IF HE MESSES
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

40:25.557 --> 40:29.094
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

40:29.127 --> 40:31.763
CHRIS...

40:31.797 --> 40:35.667
YOU WERE
A CRAPPY HUSBAND...

40:35.701 --> 40:38.970
BUT YOU ARE
A GOOD PERSON.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.835
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU ARE UNFIRED.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.703
[scoffs]
WHY?

41:13.705 --> 41:16.041
YOU SOLD ME OUT
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW

41:16.074 --> 41:20.178
THAT YOU WERE GONNA GET THROWN
OUT OF MED SCHOOL.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.813
THAT'S JUST...

41:21.847 --> 41:24.750
KIND OF IMPRESSIVE.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.820
I KEEP MY JOB
IF I STAND UP TO YOU.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.756
I KEEP IT IF I DON'T.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.524
I...
[chuckles]

41:32.558 --> 41:34.025
DON'T BUY IT.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.163
WHEN CUDDY
WAS PROTECTING ME BEFORE,

41:38.196 --> 41:39.698
SHE WAS PROTECTING
A DOCTOR.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.734
SHE'S NOW PROTECTING
A BOYFRIEND.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.537
THE HOSPITAL'S NOT GONNA
PUT UP WITH THAT FOR LONG.

41:45.571 --> 41:48.574
SO I NEED YOU
TO PROTECT ME

41:48.607 --> 41:51.176
FROM DOING SOMETHING
CUDDY WILL REGRET.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.750
SEE YOU BRIGHT
AND LATE TOMORROW.

42:06.592 --> 42:09.561
[mellow rock music]

42:09.595 --> 42:14.700
*

42:14.733 --> 42:17.903
MOM...

42:17.936 --> 42:20.005
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO KEEP THIS?

42:20.038 --> 42:23.141
SO I CAN MOUNT IT
ON THE WALL,

42:23.174 --> 42:25.611
LIKE A MOOSE HEAD.
[chuckles]

42:32.651 --> 42:33.819
IT SAYS HERE

42:33.852 --> 42:37.789
COBALT CAN CAUSE RASHES,

42:37.823 --> 42:42.828
DIZZINESS,
AND STOMACH PROBLEMS.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.931
YOU STILL THINK I'VE BEEN
IMAGINING THE WHOLE THING?

42:45.964 --> 42:48.333
OKAY, YOU MIGHT HAVE
A POINT.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.201
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

42:50.235 --> 42:53.304
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE DIZZINESS...

42:53.338 --> 42:55.807
SOME PAIN.

42:58.644 --> 43:06.151
*
