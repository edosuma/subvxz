00:36.453 --> 00:37.370
Mom.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.329
Cheong-san!

00:42.250 --> 00:43.209
Damn it.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.047
What the hell?

00:51.551 --> 00:52.927
Fuck!

00:57.974 --> 00:59.392
There's another zombie here!

01:03.646 --> 01:04.647
Dae-su!

01:05.398 --> 01:06.733
Stop it.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.903
Dae-su!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.617
Stop it!

01:21.539 --> 01:22.832
What are you doing?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.836
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.257
You son of a bitch!

01:40.308 --> 01:41.434
Stop it!

01:46.439 --> 01:48.066
Let go!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.568
Get the fuck off of me!

01:52.904 --> 01:53.905
Mom!

01:58.118 --> 01:59.202
Mom…

02:24.769 --> 02:26.563
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.565
Run!

02:28.648 --> 02:29.482
Come on.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.359
Hurry up!

02:31.442 --> 02:32.443
Let's go.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.993
Let's go, Cheong-san.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.371
Pull yourself together!

02:47.167 --> 02:48.126
Dae-su, the others!

02:48.751 --> 02:49.586
What?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.129
Why aren't they coming?

02:51.212 --> 02:52.255
What now?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.464
Did you see them coming?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.469
Please, Cheong-san.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.638
-Come with us.
-Let's go.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.090
Mom!

03:40.678 --> 03:43.014
Mom!

04:17.799 --> 04:20.343
-Mom…
-They're here. Hurry up!

04:21.344 --> 04:22.929
-Wu-jin!
-Get up.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.764
Come on. We have to go.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.915
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.458
Shut up. You're so heavy.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.836
Thank you, Mi-jin. Thank you so much.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.007
-Then will you go out with me?
-No.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.049
Screw you.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.385
Hold on.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.680
Why? What is it?

05:24.073 --> 05:24.949
Hear that?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.828
Shit. Fucking zombies.

05:31.122 --> 05:31.956
Let's run.

05:35.918 --> 05:36.836
Let's go.

05:36.919 --> 05:37.795
To the mountain.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.727
Ji-min. Help me.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.156
Hyo-ryeong!

06:11.204 --> 06:12.163
Get up!

06:27.929 --> 06:28.805
Get up.

06:35.853 --> 06:36.687
Ha-ri.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.728
-Wu-jin. Go.
-What are you doing here?

07:17.812 --> 07:18.855
Go.

07:18.938 --> 07:19.939
Go!

07:24.110 --> 07:25.695
-Hey!
-Hyo-ryeong. You go first.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.198
-Come on! Let's go!
-Let's go.

07:47.842 --> 07:48.843
Nam-ra, what's wrong?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.178
Damn it.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.263
Run away.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.850
Run away.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.314
What the fuck?

08:01.397 --> 08:02.398
Run!

08:03.900 --> 08:05.651
-Run!
-Run! Go!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.570
-Come on!
-Just go!

08:08.070 --> 08:10.823
Just fucking go! You're going to die!

08:10.907 --> 08:11.991
I don't fucking care!

08:13.576 --> 08:14.994
-Over here!
-This way! Hurry!

08:15.077 --> 08:16.329
Come on!

08:25.671 --> 08:27.632
Are you crazy, Mi-jin? Let go!

08:27.715 --> 08:29.258
Shut up!

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
-No! Joon-seong!
-Ha-ri!

08:36.557 --> 08:37.391
What are you doing?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.019
No! Let go, you assholes!

08:41.562 --> 08:43.064
Fuck off, assholes!

08:43.981 --> 08:45.900
Go! Hurry!

08:47.902 --> 08:50.905
No! Joon-seong!

08:53.366 --> 08:55.159
-Let go!
-Close the door!

08:55.910 --> 08:58.538
Fuck! Let go of me!

09:04.627 --> 09:05.878
Shit.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.388
Damn it.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.904
Hey, Cheong-san…

10:18.159 --> 10:19.201
I'm so sorry.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.496
I didn't know it was your mom.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.794
I'm sorry.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.302
Stop!

11:22.431 --> 11:24.892
Stay away!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.669
Mom…

12:18.612 --> 12:21.991
A virus must have a consistent pattern
for a vaccine to be made.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.327
But the Jonas Virus

12:26.287 --> 12:28.497
transforms and evolves on its own.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.543
It is an ever-changing monster.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.799
A treatment or a vaccine are impossible.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.177
There is only one solution.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.056
Death.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.643
Completely burning and killing the host

12:50.436 --> 12:52.938
so that not a single cell remains.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.152
The moment we are consumed by arrogance
and think we can defeat the virus,

12:59.528 --> 13:01.030
mankind will become extinct.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.787
The amount of data was massive,
so we couldn't analyze it all,

13:07.870 --> 13:10.080
but a significant portion
of it is credible.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.416
How can you prove that?

13:12.500 --> 13:18.380
The KDCA is creating a virus
using the exact method he described.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.508
If they can create the same virus,

13:20.591 --> 13:23.344
they'll conclude it is credible.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.596
My goodness.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.683
I thought only crazy soldiers
were frightening.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.977
It's scarier when a scientist goes crazy.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.772
Did you hear
they're expanding martial law?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.107
What do you mean?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.944
Why? We're handling it well.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.780
I have a friend in the NIS analysis team,

13:42.863 --> 13:45.658
and he said they're discussing
pulling back the blockade to Yangdong

13:45.741 --> 13:47.451
and expanding martial law.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.706
What about Hyosan?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.670
They understand there may be sacrifices.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.722
We may have ceased our rescue operation,

14:10.182 --> 14:13.060
but we never know
when we may rescue survivors again.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.940
Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.111
The moment the blockade is penetrated…

14:24.071 --> 14:25.614
someone must step forward

14:26.991 --> 14:28.492
and abandon Hyosan.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.706
Take this.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.338
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

14:45.050 --> 14:47.803
I thought you came in person to save me,

14:49.179 --> 14:50.389
but you came to abandon me.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.099
My source in the NIS tells me

14:52.600 --> 14:55.936
something will happen soon in Hyosan.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.900
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

15:00.983 --> 15:04.278
I'll say you even resigned from your post
in order to prevent it.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.114
You should be able
to avoid responsibility.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.532
Responsibility for what?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.075
Anything.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.869
Trust me and sign it.

15:11.952 --> 15:16.081
I'll protect your political career
until the end.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.543
Do you need time to think it over?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.462
They're not saving Hyosan, are they?

15:25.507 --> 15:26.634
They're abandoning it?

15:27.676 --> 15:29.178
Take your time and think about it.

15:29.261 --> 15:33.140
Sign it within the day
and give it to the person in charge here.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.116
Sir.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.369
-Sir…
-Let's go.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.998
Ma'am! We're getting out now, right?

15:58.082 --> 16:01.585
Since the party leader came,
it'll all be resolved, right?

16:02.127 --> 16:05.422
He says he'll save us, right?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.049
Ma'am?

17:51.111 --> 17:52.738
I thought about it all night.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.824
What do I do?

17:58.243 --> 17:59.369
How do I go on living?

18:10.005 --> 18:11.882
Let's talk a little later.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.636
Tomorrow or the day after.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.970
Or next week.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.391
After we get out of here, eat,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.352
and get ourselves clean.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.270
Let's talk then.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.147
Okay?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.322
We still have a lot to talk about.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.742
So let's do that.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.258
Whatever happens…

18:56.385 --> 18:57.511
don't give up.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.014
Okay?

19:05.727 --> 19:06.603
Okay.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.823
Never.

19:20.951 --> 19:21.785
Okay.

19:23.120 --> 19:23.954
You too.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.207
Okay.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.793
Me too.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.607
What is it?

20:34.816 --> 20:35.943
Do you see something?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.325
The smell got stronger.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.837
I don't smell anything.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.258
I think they're all coming this way.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.260
The smell is really strong.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.306
We're trapped in here.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.642
There's no way to leave.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.645
Don't say that.

21:13.063 --> 21:13.897
But it's true.

21:14.856 --> 21:15.816
There is no way.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.068
Whatever.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.279
Let them kill us if they want.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.497
Ha-ri.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.584
You didn't get eliminated
in the preliminaries, did you?

21:37.796 --> 21:38.630
No.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.674
I made it.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.260
You had a tournament.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.013
Why did you come to the school?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.978
-Are you her brother?
-Yes. So?

21:53.061 --> 21:55.856
She got a perfect score.
She made it onto the national team.

21:55.939 --> 21:56.773
I saw her.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.027
Really?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.322
Yes, really.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.783
Then you're really on the national team?

22:07.743 --> 22:08.618
Do Mom and Dad know?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.121
How could they? Look at what's going on.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.374
She jumped out of the team bus
and ran here to find you.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.334
Hey, kid.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.836
You better be good to her.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.464
Be good to me too.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.053
Who is she anyway?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.930
Why does she keep speaking for you?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.393
She's my friend.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.229
We're freaking besties.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.317
Jeez, you scared me.

22:41.068 --> 22:41.943
What's your deal?

22:45.530 --> 22:46.365
I…

22:47.949 --> 22:49.034
What?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.621
I like you.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.498
What? Crazy bastard.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.833
Hey.

22:57.834 --> 22:58.919
What's wrong with you?

22:59.002 --> 23:01.755
I saw you shooting arrows.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.800
I saw you train every morning.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.927
I went to every tournament
and cheered for you.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.554
I'm the one who yelled,
"Bronzed beauty Jang Ha-ri."

23:10.055 --> 23:12.474
I've sincerely liked you for years.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.018
Now…

23:16.103 --> 23:18.313
I want to be a man, not just a fan.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.276
I'm going to die anyway.
So I want to say what I want first.

23:34.037 --> 23:34.955
This is awesome.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.332
You're Dae-su, right?

23:38.041 --> 23:40.127
The one who calls my brother
"Brother-In-Law."

23:41.420 --> 23:42.295
Yes.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.548
So you knew.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.842
Brother-In-Law, did you tell her?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.260
I might have.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.934
Does confessing feel cathartic?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.394
Yes.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.396
-Then you're okay with dying, right?
-Yes.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.314
What? Now?

24:02.774 --> 24:05.652
You asshole.
I'm pissed off and needed to vent.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.028
-Wu-jin, stop her.
-Ha-ri.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.738
-You're dead.
-Stop her.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.574
-Come here.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.245
-No. I'm glad you told me.
-Hey. That's not it.

24:15.328 --> 24:16.913
Yes, it is. Get over here.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.416
Why don't you understand?
I really like you.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.418
-Get over here, asshole.
-Wu-jin. Help.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.712
-Sorry.
-Stop her, Wu-jin.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.838
Get over here. You punk.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.673
-Beat him up, Ha-ri.
-Come here.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.633
-He needs a good beating.
-Look at him dodging.

24:30.802 --> 24:31.720
Look at him.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.346
What's that?

24:34.639 --> 24:36.516
That's not it!

24:37.476 --> 24:38.727
Hey.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.689
Come here. You're going to keep dodging?

24:42.772 --> 24:45.817
-Hey, stop it. Stop her.
-I don't want to come between you two.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.320
-Come here.
-Only if you promise not to hit me.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.133
Where did those fuckers go?

25:26.775 --> 25:27.901
What are you doing?

25:27.984 --> 25:30.445
Don't you think
we can get out using these?

25:41.081 --> 25:44.793
We can tie the carts together
in a circle and go inside to escape.

25:53.635 --> 25:57.305
We need string or something
to tie them together in a circle.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.015
I think it's this one.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.234
Cut as many as possible.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.488
Hey. It won't work like this.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.450
We should flip it completely
and hide underneath.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.536
No. We should stand it up.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.830
You think the zombies can't climb this?

26:21.913 --> 26:23.290
This is enough.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.917
Don't be stupid.
Untie them all. Let's redo them.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.837
It's too short if we close the lids.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.130
What? You want to crawl?

26:30.213 --> 26:31.965
Must she pull rank right now?

26:32.048 --> 26:33.133
Hey.

26:33.883 --> 26:34.759
What did you just say?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.012
If you don't like it, make your own.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.059
Hey.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.644
Hey. What's wrong with you?

26:45.687 --> 26:46.605
Stop that.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.691
-Ha-ri. Stop her.
-Say that again.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.277
So what if you're older.
Stay out of our way.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.195
Hey.

26:55.905 --> 26:56.990
Fuck you.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.242
"Fuck you"? Get out of my way.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.201
Cut it out.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.662
You too, Joon-yeong.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.748
Who the hell is she to tell us to redo it?

27:04.831 --> 27:07.500
"Who the hell is she"? You rude prick.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.587
-You're coming with us, right?
-You're the ones coming with us.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.673
We're not leaving the seniors, right?

27:13.757 --> 27:14.883
Of course not.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.136
We're going to go together anyway.
Why are you fighting already?

27:18.219 --> 27:21.014
So do as I say unless you want to die.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.892
We want to make it high
so that we don't die.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.393
Enough already.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.397
How many died on our way here?

27:29.981 --> 27:31.358
We can't lose anyone else.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.319
We shouldn't fight among ourselves.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.695
I'm not fighting to die.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.323
It's because I want to live.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.992
Then do as I say, asshole.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.912
Then let's go separately.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.205
Make it yourself.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.041
-That fucker. Get back here.
-Joon-yeong.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.250
Get back here!

27:49.334 --> 27:52.671
Let go of me, fuck!
Am I doing this because I want to die?

27:57.801 --> 27:59.010
Let's vote on it.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.595
And who are you?

28:03.056 --> 28:04.349
The classroom president.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.769
One. We split up.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.692
Two. We go together.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.240
-We'll go together. Next.
-Is it smart to vote?

28:20.740 --> 28:23.702
On life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.996
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.624
There's something called
collective intelligence.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.459
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.837
-What are you looking at?
-It doesn't work like that.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.338
Then what?

28:36.631 --> 28:38.133
Should we vote about voting?

28:38.216 --> 28:41.261
Hey, how did you kids survive until now?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.221
Sorry, but will you butt out?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.765
We're doing this
because you started the fight.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.475
Give me an arrow so I can stab him.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.060
We'll proceed to the next item.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.397
One. Make the outside high.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.992
Five votes.

29:04.075 --> 29:04.951
Two.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.455
Fold the lids and make a box.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.128
Four votes.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.630
What the hell?
You said it's better to stand them up.

29:19.007 --> 29:19.883
I changed my mind.

29:20.383 --> 29:24.304
Option one received the majority vote.
We'll make the walls high.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.723
Hey. What about you?

29:28.141 --> 29:29.559
It's a tie if you're for two.

29:31.936 --> 29:32.812
I'm for option one.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.272
Fuck.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.567
-Hey. Let's make it.
-Okay.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.153
Hey, don't resent me later.

29:40.236 --> 29:42.197
The zombies really will climb over.

29:42.697 --> 29:45.033
I'll lead the way and take responsibility.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.075
You can stand back.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.535
That prick.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.914
Hey. Why are kids these days so damn rude?

29:50.997 --> 29:52.165
No one compares to you.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.585
Must you humiliate me
in front of underclassmen?

29:56.461 --> 30:00.673
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.259
This is a sample from an infected person.

30:03.843 --> 30:07.222
The two viruses are a 98% match.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.601
Are you saying everything he said
in the videos is true?

30:11.684 --> 30:14.521
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

30:15.021 --> 30:18.942
Only the virus survives. It stimulates
the brain stem and moves the body.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.652
They're like moving corpses.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.614
There's no way
to bring a dead person back to life.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.494
Are you saying he's dead?

30:30.662 --> 30:34.207
Staff Sgt. Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.960
But for that girl,

30:37.043 --> 30:38.878
it's difficult to explain.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.674
She was found alive.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.971
There's never been a virus with this fast
of a rate of infection before.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.807
Getting rid of the host is
the only solution.

30:50.890 --> 30:54.060
Don't make it sound so simple!

30:54.143 --> 30:56.271
You people must find a solution.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.651
Commander.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.319
They broke through the barricade.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.405
It's spreading into Yangdong.

31:07.740 --> 31:08.658
How bad is the spread?

31:09.158 --> 31:12.120
They're taking Route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.873
We sent army reservists
from the area to the barricades.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.921
Send all the reservists
to create a lockdown zone in Yangdong

31:22.005 --> 31:23.464
and evacuate the city.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.133
-Call in all the officials.
-Yes, sir.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.803
You said you had a friend
in the NIS, right?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.096
Yes, sir.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.890
Ask him to meet officially.

31:31.973 --> 31:32.891
Yes, sir.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.857
You have to tie the knots tighter.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.567
Here too?

31:45.820 --> 31:48.531
-I hope we aren't doing anything stupid.
-My hands hurt.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.490
Just do it.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.535
-Hey, that looks good. Hand it to me.
-We're dead either way.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.870
-Hey, come here.
-Me?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.413
Ha-ri almost killed me.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.581
-Hey.
-Hey, Dae-su.

31:57.123 --> 31:57.999
A candy bar.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.254
Let me see.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.465
Can we eat it?

32:07.383 --> 32:08.593
It's past the expiration date.

32:08.676 --> 32:09.928
Can't we just eat it?

32:11.095 --> 32:12.221
Of course we can.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.691
You have to take tiny bites.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.945
-Me first?
-We all need to have a bite. Okay?

32:31.157 --> 32:34.410
Damn it. I said to take a small bite.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.829
I only ate this much.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.748
Fuck. Selfish prick.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.679
I already ate.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.169
I already ate too. Here.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.218
-Hey.
-What?

33:32.301 --> 33:33.678
Joon-yeong didn't eat.

33:35.638 --> 33:36.931
How could you eat it all?

33:40.768 --> 33:41.769
I…

33:42.478 --> 33:45.273
I thought I was last. I'm really sorry.

33:46.774 --> 33:47.942
Damn it.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.236
Let's just put on our protective pads.

33:52.905 --> 33:56.325
-That asshole.
-Joon-yeong, you wear the best one.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.130
Take off your shoes. I'll do yours first.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.175
Let's do this first.

34:17.847 --> 34:18.681
Hold on tight.

34:32.945 --> 34:33.780
Cheong-san.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.239
What?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.079
Don't you hate me?

34:41.162 --> 34:43.372
-No.
-Why not?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.415
I don't know.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.876
I've never hated you.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.378
That amazes me too.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.566
Is everyone ready?

35:12.151 --> 35:13.027
I'm opening the door.

35:13.111 --> 35:13.945
Hold on.

35:16.739 --> 35:17.657
It'll work out, right?

35:19.450 --> 35:20.284
It will.

35:21.536 --> 35:24.997
-Don't do anything stupid. Stick with me.
-You stick next to me.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.874
Don't do anything stupid.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.299
Then neither of us can move.

35:37.885 --> 35:38.886
I'm scared.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.357
I'll lead. You take the tail.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.282
I'll open it.

36:00.741 --> 36:01.701
Fuck.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.328
I hope you're right.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.455
I've seen countless zombies.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.626
They don't have
the intelligence to climb over.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.061
-Push!
-In front of you!

36:31.898 --> 36:32.773
Go forward!

36:33.649 --> 36:34.609
More!

36:34.692 --> 36:35.651
Turn!

36:36.402 --> 36:37.236
Turn!

36:38.487 --> 36:39.530
Get in!

36:41.616 --> 36:43.576
-Hurry!
-Close it!

36:47.330 --> 36:48.581
Did you tie it?

36:49.540 --> 36:50.625
Done! Push!

36:50.708 --> 36:51.626
Push!

36:57.632 --> 36:58.883
Push!

36:58.966 --> 37:00.509
Fuck!

37:01.427 --> 37:03.054
They're climbing over!

37:06.515 --> 37:07.892
It won't fucking budge!

37:08.809 --> 37:09.644
Push harder!

37:10.436 --> 37:11.312
We can do this!

37:13.439 --> 37:14.398
Push harder! Harder!

37:15.066 --> 37:17.068
It won't move!

37:27.536 --> 37:28.412
Fuck!

37:51.352 --> 37:53.104
Be careful!

37:54.272 --> 37:55.231
Let go!

37:59.777 --> 38:01.362
What are you doing? Push!

38:01.445 --> 38:02.947
Push!

38:31.017 --> 38:32.852
-Su-hyeok! Above you!
-Damn it.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.318
-No!
-Fuck!

38:53.164 --> 38:54.874
Hey! Are you okay?

38:56.959 --> 38:58.252
Damn it! Hey!

39:07.511 --> 39:10.848
Shit. I shouldn't have said
I'd take responsibility.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.769
-Where are you going?
-Hey, wait!

39:14.852 --> 39:15.895
-Joon-yeong!
-Hey! Stop!

39:15.978 --> 39:18.147
-Joon-yeong!
-What the hell?

39:18.230 --> 39:20.024
-Hey!
-Joon-yeong!

39:27.948 --> 39:29.116
Get off, fuckers!

39:30.159 --> 39:31.452
Get off, you bastards!

39:32.495 --> 39:33.537
Push!

39:36.999 --> 39:38.167
Hurry! Push!

39:50.888 --> 39:52.515
Let's go! Let's go home!

39:53.349 --> 39:54.517
Fuck…

39:59.688 --> 40:01.190
Let's go home!

40:07.446 --> 40:08.781
A little more!

40:09.615 --> 40:11.158
Just a little more!

40:12.827 --> 40:14.412
-Joon-yeong…
-A little more.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.501
No!

40:20.584 --> 40:23.754
No! Wait! Fuck!

40:37.476 --> 40:38.436
Push!

40:42.064 --> 40:42.898
Push!

40:49.947 --> 40:51.907
Push! Push harder!

40:57.413 --> 40:59.165
-Push!
-Push!

41:18.559 --> 41:19.393
Fuck!

41:40.706 --> 41:43.250
HYOSAN

41:43.334 --> 41:44.627
Each of those red dots

41:44.710 --> 41:47.963
is the location of a random cell phone
owned by a Hyosan resident.

41:50.299 --> 41:54.553
At first, they moved erratically,
so there was nothing to analyze.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.683
But they slowly began to display
a collective movement.

42:01.268 --> 42:04.480
If you look at them as a whole,
they're slowly traveling outward.

42:06.774 --> 42:10.069
There is no one left
to attack in the city,

42:10.152 --> 42:13.197
so they are increasing their radius.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.534
It's probably similar
to animals leaving the mountains

42:16.617 --> 42:19.370
and coming into civilization
when they run out of food.

42:20.704 --> 42:21.956
Let's cut to the chase.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.376
You predicted future movements too, right?

42:25.459 --> 42:27.294
That's why you proposed to the NSC

42:27.378 --> 42:30.381
that we abandon Yangdong as well
and expand martial law.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.638
It isn't precise,

42:38.764 --> 42:39.640
but take a look.

42:40.808 --> 42:44.478
A week from now, it'll reach Seongnam,
Hanam, Gwacheon, Anyang,

42:44.562 --> 42:46.605
and Gwangmyeong.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.859
And the day after that, it'll reach Seoul.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.070
Isn't that stretching it?

42:53.153 --> 42:54.613
That's one person.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.283
It was a simulation of what would happen

42:57.366 --> 43:01.245
if just one infected person
got out of Hyosan.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.292
That's what will happen.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.340
Her heart rate is reaching 250.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.553
Abnormal heartbeat detected!

43:29.481 --> 43:34.320
I'M HUNGRY

43:40.784 --> 43:44.079
Tell the tactical team
to come up with a strategy to bomb Hyosan.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.082
Bomb the city?

43:49.043 --> 43:50.711
Do you plan to blow up Hyosan?

43:52.046 --> 43:54.089
We'll lose Korea trying to save Hyosan.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.050
Act like a soldier.

43:56.550 --> 43:57.426
We can't.

43:57.509 --> 43:59.261
The infected are one thing,

43:59.345 --> 44:01.472
but what about the civilians
we haven't rescued?

44:01.555 --> 44:03.515
Don't calculate how many we'll kill.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.393
Think only about how many we'll save.

44:17.446 --> 44:20.783
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

44:56.568 --> 44:57.736
Just a little bit more!

44:58.737 --> 44:59.780
Untie it!

45:05.160 --> 45:06.495
It's untied! Push!

45:06.578 --> 45:08.372
-Push!
-Push!

45:10.916 --> 45:12.084
A little more this way!

45:14.628 --> 45:15.796
Fuck!

45:19.967 --> 45:21.844
-It won't open!
-Shit.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.053
What do you mean?

45:23.137 --> 45:24.763
-The door won't open!
-Move back!

45:43.323 --> 45:44.199
Ha-ri, move!

45:51.123 --> 45:54.042
Get lost, assholes! Get lost!

46:51.892 --> 46:52.893
Hurry up!

46:53.644 --> 46:56.313
It won't open.
It must be locked from the outside.

46:59.691 --> 47:00.692
Damn it.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.283
Dad.

51:52.150 --> 51:54.569
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

51:54.653 --> 51:56.863
