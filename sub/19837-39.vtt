00:03.730 --> 00:07.720
<b>There are six distinct categories of <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

00:08.770 --> 00:10.110
<b>Enhancer.</b>

00:10.110 --> 00:15.030
<b>Enhancers are able to strengthen 
various objects' effectiveness.</b>

00:15.780 --> 00:16.960
<b>Transmuter.</b>

00:16.960 --> 00:20.740
<b>Transmuters can use their aura 
to alter objects' qualities.</b>

00:21.830 --> 00:23.220
<b>Conjurer.</b>

00:23.220 --> 00:27.840
<b>Somewhat akin to Transmuters, 
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.</b>

00:28.810 --> 00:30.140
<b>Emitter.</b>

00:30.140 --> 00:33.460
<b>Emitters can propel their 
aura like projectiles.</b>

00:34.470 --> 00:35.860
<b>Manipulator.</b>

00:35.860 --> 00:39.440
<b>Manipulators can use their auras to 
control objects and creatures.</b>

00:40.290 --> 00:41.750
<b>Specialist.</b>

00:41.750 --> 00:45.690
<b>Specialists are those with rare abilities 
that don't fit in the other five classes.</b>

00:46.870 --> 00:49.720
<b>Begin by determining which 
category your aura falls within.</b>

00:50.360 --> 00:55.030
<b>That is the first step to 
becoming a skilled <i>Nen</i> user.</b>

02:16.190 --> 02:17.650
<b>Mito-san!</b>

02:18.140 --> 02:21.330
<b>I'm going to find Ging!</b>

02:22.990 --> 02:27.300
<b>After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.</b>

02:29.740 --> 02:33.270
<b>Take care of yourself until then!</b>

02:35.880 --> 02:40.880
<b>Wish x And x Promise</b>

02:42.680 --> 02:46.110
<b>As Gon and Killua depart from Whale Island,</b>

02:46.680 --> 02:50.850
<b>Kurapika was also preparing 
to begin his journey.</b>

02:53.650 --> 02:55.400
<b>You remember me?</b>

02:55.810 --> 02:59.270
<b>Sure, we don't get many visitors here.</b>

02:59.870 --> 03:04.330
<b>Since you were here, only one 
other person has dropped by.</b>

03:05.710 --> 03:09.390
<b>This place is much harder 
to find than you realize.</b>

03:16.060 --> 03:18.840
<b>You found the agency on your own,</b>

03:18.840 --> 03:20.670
<b>so you must be pretty sharp.</b>

03:21.510 --> 03:25.680
<b>But I can't recommend you to 
one of our valued clients.</b>

03:26.070 --> 03:28.970
<b>I have no problem with your lack of experience.</b>

03:28.970 --> 03:31.460
<b>Some clients don't mind greenhorns.</b>

03:31.870 --> 03:35.230
<b>But it isn't experience alone that you lack.</b>

03:35.830 --> 03:37.270
<b>What do you mean?</b>

03:37.270 --> 03:40.080
<b>I said that I have a Hunter License!</b>

03:40.080 --> 03:43.450
<b>But your exam hasn't ended yet.</b>

03:43.850 --> 03:45.370
<b>I can tell.</b>

03:46.590 --> 03:47.680
<b>What?</b>

03:52.730 --> 03:54.710
<b>You can't see a thing, right?</b>

03:58.630 --> 04:00.210
<b>Once you've learned to see,</b>

04:00.210 --> 04:02.180
<b>return.</b>

04:24.360 --> 04:27.770
<b>You can't see it, but you can sense it.</b>

04:28.560 --> 04:29.910
<b>Why did you do that?!</b>

04:29.910 --> 04:31.160
<b>This?</b>

04:31.160 --> 04:33.620
<b>Well, I was just playing with you.</b>

04:34.660 --> 04:38.300
<b>Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.</b>

04:38.760 --> 04:42.840
<b>Consider this advice from a veteran...</b>

04:45.920 --> 04:48.200
<b>You didn't notice when I stole this,</b>

04:48.540 --> 04:52.010
<b>and you didn't notice when I walked past you.</b>

04:52.680 --> 04:53.750
<b>Bastard...</b>

04:53.750 --> 04:55.860
<b>Return my Hunter License!</b>

04:57.150 --> 04:59.540
<b>Can a newbie who knows nothing</b>

05:00.560 --> 05:02.610
<b>of <i>Nen</i> defeat me?</b>

05:03.070 --> 05:04.360
<b><i>Nen?</i></b>

05:09.870 --> 05:11.570
<b>Wanna give it a try?</b>

05:23.850 --> 05:25.450
<b>Understand now?</b>

05:25.450 --> 05:27.890
<b>You still lack something.</b>

05:31.510 --> 05:32.660
<b>Come with me.</b>

05:35.570 --> 05:37.030
<b>I'll be your teacher.</b>

05:40.070 --> 05:42.900
<b>The real exam has only just begun.</b>

05:52.620 --> 05:57.030
<b>Today, we'll determine which 
class your aura falls within.</b>

06:21.400 --> 06:23.590
<b>There's something forming in the water...</b>

06:24.210 --> 06:26.440
<b>You're a Conjurer.</b>

06:28.380 --> 06:29.810
<b>A Conjurer...</b>

06:29.810 --> 06:33.160
<b>A type that specializes in 
manifesting their auras.</b>

06:33.160 --> 06:34.390
<b>I see...</b>

06:34.390 --> 06:36.560
<b>Ideally, I would have liked to 
have been an Enhancer.</b>

06:36.560 --> 06:39.460
<b>Can't do anything about 
what you're born with.</b>

06:39.860 --> 06:43.460
<b>You can still learn Enhancer techniques.</b>

06:43.900 --> 06:47.580
<b>I'll spend the day expounding in further detail.</b>

06:51.320 --> 06:57.670
<b>Let's say you have a 100% chance 
of mastering Conjurer techniques.</b>

06:57.670 --> 06:58.760
<b>From that,</b>

06:58.760 --> 07:01.230
<b>these are your odds of learning 
the other techniques.</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:14.240
<b>Enhancer 60% 
Transmuter 80% 
Conjurer 100%</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:14.240
<b>Emitter 40% 
Manipulator 60% 
Specialist 0% 
</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:14.240
<b>Hatsu</b>

07:03.330 --> 07:05.410
<b>It doesn't matter if you're a quick study,</b>

07:05.410 --> 07:10.010
<b>you can never completely 
master a different category.</b>

07:10.010 --> 07:14.240
<b>The further a category is, the less likely 
you are to learn its techniques.</b>

07:14.850 --> 07:17.000
<b>Why is Specialist 0%?</b>

07:17.000 --> 07:19.630
<b>Specialist is a unique category.</b>

07:19.630 --> 07:22.500
<b>You can't learn Specialist techniques.</b>

07:23.030 --> 07:24.960
<b>These are very distinct abilities</b>

07:24.960 --> 07:29.510
<b>that are genetic or naturally acquired by 
growing up under extreme conditions.</b>

07:30.010 --> 07:32.370
<b>So why is it in this specific position?</b>

07:32.370 --> 07:35.700
<b>Because the adjacent categories, 
Conjurer and Manipulator,</b>

07:35.700 --> 07:38.770
<b>have the highest chance of 
becoming Specialists later on.</b>

07:39.480 --> 07:43.250
<b>In that respect, your chances 
are better than most.</b>

07:44.240 --> 07:46.670
<b>Remember what you said earlier?</b>

07:51.450 --> 07:52.280
<b><i>I...</i></b>

07:53.250 --> 07:54.580
<b><i>I need...</i></b>

07:55.510 --> 07:58.460
<b><i>enough power to fight on my own!</i></b>

08:07.680 --> 08:09.340
<b>You are correct</b>

08:09.340 --> 08:14.300
<b>to assume that the fastest means to your 
goal would be via Enhancer abilities.</b>

08:14.820 --> 08:17.210
<b>The Enhancer category 
is the most efficacious</b>

08:17.210 --> 08:20.810
<b>for bolstering offensive, 
defensive, and healing capabilities.</b>

08:21.270 --> 08:23.650
<b>However, as a Conjurer,</b>

08:23.650 --> 08:27.550
<b>you can only learn Enhancer techniques 
at about half of their original potency.</b>

08:28.290 --> 08:32.680
<b>When you attempt to use an ability beyond 
your capacity, this creates strain,</b>

08:32.680 --> 08:34.260
<b>which can weaken you,</b>

08:35.100 --> 08:37.100
<b>possibly fatally.</b>

08:39.270 --> 08:43.170
<b>In order to consistently come out 
on top, you need a stable power.</b>

08:43.170 --> 08:46.690
<b>Will the stable power gained through 
mastery of Conjurer techniques</b>

08:46.690 --> 08:51.140
<b>put me on equal footing 
with master Enhancers?</b>

08:53.280 --> 08:55.530
<b>The brief answer is that it would be difficult.</b>

08:56.080 --> 08:59.610
<b>Enhancers employ strong offensive 
and defensive abilities.</b>

08:59.610 --> 09:03.480
<b>Conjurers usually suffer from an 
inclination toward one or the other.</b>

09:04.280 --> 09:08.480
<b>On the other hand, this makes them incredibly 
strong under the correct circumstances.</b>

09:10.380 --> 09:11.790
<b>Pop quiz time.</b>

09:12.840 --> 09:16.740
<b>Is it possible to conjure a sword 
that can cut through anything?</b>

09:17.410 --> 09:18.410
<b>That is impossible.</b>

09:18.410 --> 09:19.490
<b>Why?</b>

09:19.810 --> 09:22.750
<b>Because that exceeds the 
bounds of human ability.</b>

09:24.420 --> 09:25.650
<b>Exactly.</b>

09:26.530 --> 09:29.610
<b>Even if you completely master 
Conjurer techniques,</b>

09:29.610 --> 09:31.790
<b>you will still be unable to 
conjure some objects.</b>

09:32.700 --> 09:36.960
<b>You could conjure a sharp, sturdy sword.</b>

09:36.960 --> 09:41.010
<b>However, it would make more 
sense to just buy a good sword.</b>

09:41.830 --> 09:43.690
<b>Because it wouldn't require 
any additional training.</b>

09:44.010 --> 09:47.410
<b>Though with <i>Nen</i>, you can easily make 
the sword appear and disappear.</b>

09:47.930 --> 09:52.270
<b>So conjured weapons aren't as effective 
as their physical counterparts,</b>

09:52.730 --> 09:56.400
<b>but you can't conjure anything omnipotent.</b>

09:57.360 --> 10:01.220
<b>You will need to reflect on what 
it is that you wish to conjure.</b>

10:01.220 --> 10:02.630
<b>Failure is not acceptable.</b>

10:03.180 --> 10:06.370
<b>Because you will need an incredible amount</b>

10:06.370 --> 10:09.920
<b>of focus, imagination, and training</b>

10:09.920 --> 10:11.350
<b>to conjure a single object.</b>

10:13.040 --> 10:14.740
<b>This is a surprise.</b>

10:15.880 --> 10:19.300
<b>Learning <i>Nen</i> only took you half a year?</b>

10:20.190 --> 10:23.180
<b>So, what kind of employer are you seeking?</b>

10:25.570 --> 10:28.270
<b><i>I have some information for you 
regarding the spider.</i></b>

10:32.220 --> 10:36.410
<b><i>I shall await you in Yorknew City, 
on September 1st.</i></b>

10:37.420 --> 10:42.200
<b>I'm looking for someone who has a lot of 
influence on the Yorknew auction.</b>

10:42.200 --> 10:44.090
<b>The nature of the job itself is irrelevant.</b>

10:44.670 --> 10:46.830
<b>The Yorknew City auction...</b>

10:49.650 --> 10:51.950
<b>Employers with a lot of influence</b>

10:51.950 --> 10:54.260
<b>generally post the more difficult jobs.</b>

10:54.260 --> 10:57.840
<b>I doubt any of them will hire a 
Hunter with zero experience.</b>

11:00.320 --> 11:01.590
<b>I see three of them...</b>

11:02.060 --> 11:06.440
<b>Three employers who will decide based on 
the interview, rather than your record.</b>

11:06.440 --> 11:09.290
<b>And they're only looking for bodyguards.</b>

11:10.460 --> 11:12.350
<b>I'll give you descriptions, 
so make your choice.</b>

11:13.210 --> 11:15.240
<b>The first one is a gun fanatic.</b>

11:15.240 --> 11:21.610
<b>Specifically, he's looking for a Midget Corp.
Golsnake 55, Limited Edition, Series #001.</b>

11:22.020 --> 11:24.790
<b>The second one is a collector of fine china.</b>

11:24.790 --> 11:30.870
<b>Wants Lord Corp. commemorative 
plates from 1655 and 1657...</b>

11:31.470 --> 11:34.650
<b>The third one collects human trophies.</b>

11:35.730 --> 11:39.580
<b>Skin covered in snaking dragon tattoos,</b>

11:39.580 --> 11:43.390
<b>jellied infant skulls, etc.</b>

11:43.780 --> 11:45.770
<b>A fascinating hobby.</b>

11:45.770 --> 11:47.870
<b>Well, take your pick.</b>

11:50.500 --> 11:51.390
<b>Chains?</b>

11:51.810 --> 11:54.680
<b>Yes, when I heard about conjuring,</b>

11:54.680 --> 11:56.760
<b>that was the first thing that came to mind.</b>

11:57.340 --> 11:58.790
<b>Chains, huh...</b>

11:58.790 --> 12:00.150
<b>Why's that?</b>

12:00.980 --> 12:04.810
<b>Because there's evil running 
loose that needs to be</b>

12:04.810 --> 12:07.160
<b>chained down to hell.</b>

12:08.610 --> 12:10.160
<b>Really, now?</b>

12:10.620 --> 12:15.510
<b>I have a feeling that you're 
really chaining yourself down.</b>

12:16.180 --> 12:17.550
<b>What do you know?</b>

12:18.440 --> 12:20.280
<b>Hey! Wait up!</b>

12:20.740 --> 12:22.050
<b>I'm your teacher!</b>

12:22.610 --> 12:24.140
<b>I'm not finished talking!</b>

12:24.140 --> 12:25.220
<b>Hold it right there!</b>

12:26.540 --> 12:28.190
<b>Didn't you hear my explanation?</b>

12:28.190 --> 12:31.220
<b>Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!</b>

12:31.220 --> 12:35.480
<b>And conjuring unbreakable chains is impossible!</b>

12:46.940 --> 12:48.700
<b><i>On September 1st,</i></b>

12:48.700 --> 12:51.920
<b><i>Yorknew City will host the

<b><i>Where the Phantom Troupe will appear.</i></b>

13:05.370 --> 13:07.150
<b><i>What a fearsome heartbeat...</i></b>

13:07.790 --> 13:10.010
<b><i>It plays a terrible melody of rage...</i></b>

13:19.710 --> 13:22.270
<b>You want me to introduce 
you to an employer</b>

13:22.270 --> 13:26.230
<b>with connections to the Yorknew auction?</b>

13:26.230 --> 13:26.990
<b>Yes.</b>

13:27.720 --> 13:29.620
<b>Just like the last person who walked in.</b>

13:29.620 --> 13:30.280
<b>Huh?</b>

13:30.670 --> 13:33.050
<b>I got the same request twice today.</b>

13:33.050 --> 13:34.240
<b>That's amusing.</b>

13:35.300 --> 13:36.540
<b>The boy I just passed?</b>

13:38.130 --> 13:39.350
<b>You know him?</b>

13:39.350 --> 13:40.480
<b>What?</b>

13:40.480 --> 13:41.460
<b>No.</b>

13:44.080 --> 13:46.050
<b><i>He is interested in the auction, too...</i></b>

13:47.320 --> 13:51.080
<b><i>Why is his heartbeat so full of rage?</i></b>

<b>That twerp will only make

<b>We're more than willing to

14:26.170 --> 14:28.940
<b>We'll give you the best night of your life.</b>

14:29.860 --> 14:32.160
<b>Unfortunately, I am not on a date.</b>

14:32.160 --> 14:33.890
<b>I'm in the middle of a job.</b>

14:34.240 --> 14:35.520
<b>A job?</b>

14:36.330 --> 14:38.320
<b>This is my employer.</b>

14:38.320 --> 14:40.470
<b>I am his bodyguard.</b>

14:40.470 --> 14:42.170
<b>Bodyguard?</b>

14:42.170 --> 14:44.060
<b>That's a riot.</b>

14:44.060 --> 14:46.510
<b>This babe is a bodyguard?</b>

14:48.210 --> 14:51.440
<b>I'd like you to guard my body.</b>

14:52.900 --> 14:56.200
<b>I don't guard ugly men.</b>

14:56.770 --> 14:58.870
<b>Watch your mouth, woman!</b>

14:58.870 --> 14:59.960
<b>Just shut up and...</b>

15:05.130 --> 15:08.170
<b>180-Minute Love Slave</b>

15:05.590 --> 15:08.170
<b>Instant Lover.</b>

15:15.750 --> 15:18.970
<b>Please command me, mistress!</b>

15:20.810 --> 15:22.980
<b>Beat them up for me.</b>

15:23.480 --> 15:25.550
<b>Yes, I would love to!</b>

15:25.550 --> 15:26.440
<b>What?</b>

15:38.730 --> 15:40.640
<b>Tsk, he got away.</b>

15:41.290 --> 15:45.420
<b>Man, I'll have to find a new employer.</b>

15:52.740 --> 15:54.660
<b>Such a splendid moon...</b>

15:54.990 --> 15:55.970
<b>There he is!</b>

15:56.270 --> 15:57.590
<b>Surrender!</b>

15:57.590 --> 16:00.730
<b>Return the corpse samples you stole!</b>

16:02.180 --> 16:05.860
<b>Don't you interrupt my work

16:07.090 --> 16:08.730
<b>Enough fooling around! 
Hands in the air!</b>

16:09.400 --> 16:13.110
<b>Tsk, I was on the verge of 
another masterful poem.</b>

16:13.640 --> 16:16.370
<b>But you've ruined the moment.</b>

16:29.730 --> 16:34.230
<b>"A splendid full moon

16:35.160 --> 16:36.760
<b>Damn, that's horrible.</b>

16:45.020 --> 16:47.260
<b>I know, Eliza.</b>

16:47.260 --> 16:49.450
<b>If this job works out...</b>

16:50.380 --> 16:52.650
<b>Yeah, don't worry.</b>

16:52.650 --> 16:54.180
<b>I can take care of you</b>

16:54.180 --> 16:57.990
<b>along with all of the dogs.</b>

16:58.310 --> 17:00.490
<b>You don't need to worry, Eliza.</b>

17:00.970 --> 17:02.730
<b>Just bear with me a little longer.</b>

17:03.460 --> 17:05.750
<b>Yeah, it'll be fine.</b>

17:06.070 --> 17:07.950
<b>You can count on me.</b>

17:23.270 --> 17:25.640
<b>I was sent here by the agency.</b>

17:25.640 --> 17:27.290
<b>My name is Kurapika.</b>

17:42.150 --> 17:44.870
<b>Welcome.</b>

17:53.010 --> 17:55.050
<b>Please wait in here.</b>

18:17.210 --> 18:18.820
<b>I apologize for the wait.</b>

18:19.390 --> 18:21.500
<b>Everyone has arrived,</b>

18:21.500 --> 18:25.470
<b>so we will now explain the contract.</b>

18:29.060 --> 18:31.840
<b>I'll start by stating the requirements.</b>

18:32.960 --> 18:36.480
<b>I won't ask whether you have a License.</b>

18:37.070 --> 18:38.340
<b>I'm only interested</b>

18:38.340 --> 18:41.650
<b>in whether you can obtain the items we request.</b>

18:42.340 --> 18:46.090
<b>There's one month before the auction begins.</b>

18:46.090 --> 18:49.760
<b>Before then, you must find one item 
from the list we will provide,</b>

18:49.760 --> 18:52.360
<b>and bring it here.</b>

18:53.780 --> 18:57.510
<b>These are the data cards.</b>

19:04.990 --> 19:08.330
<b>Lock of hair of the famous actress Sara.</b>

19:08.330 --> 19:11.360
<b>Right arm of a mummy from an Egyptian tomb.</b>

19:11.360 --> 19:14.270
<b>An ichthyosis patient's scaly skin.</b>

19:14.270 --> 19:17.010
<b>Skull of a one-horned creature.</b>

19:19.780 --> 19:23.760
<b>The eyeballs of a Kurta.</b>

19:28.260 --> 19:29.290
<b>Hmm?</b>

19:29.290 --> 19:31.390
<b>What's wrong? You look pale.</b>

19:32.240 --> 19:34.770
<b>Ah, Kurta eyeballs?</b>

19:35.150 --> 19:36.850
<b>A-rank obtainment difficulty.</b>

19:37.410 --> 19:39.910
<b>"Preserve the scarlet hue 
immediately following death.</b>

19:39.910 --> 19:41.780
<b>Preferably with the head included."</b>

19:42.110 --> 19:44.900
<b>I've heard rumors that when Kurta</b>

19:44.900 --> 19:47.080
<b>get excited, their eyes turn scarlet...</b>

19:47.080 --> 19:47.790
<b>Shut up.</b>

19:49.680 --> 19:50.780
<b>Not another word.</b>

19:57.430 --> 19:59.010
<b>I'll say it again.</b>

19:59.010 --> 20:03.050
<b>You need only find one item from the list.</b>

20:03.460 --> 20:06.930
<b>If you are successful, you will be hired,</b>

20:06.930 --> 20:09.520
<b>to begin training as a 
bodyguard and a collector.</b>

20:10.500 --> 20:12.610
<b>Best of luck, then.</b>

20:14.140 --> 20:16.000
<b><i>I will pass this test.</i></b>

20:16.620 --> 20:19.820
<b><i>First I need to curry their favor, 
and win their trust.</i></b>

20:20.880 --> 20:25.020
<b><i>The man talking was, most likely, 
not the actual employer.</i></b>

20:25.570 --> 20:28.830
<b><i>That only illustrates the distance 
between the boss and me...</i></b>

20:29.350 --> 20:31.930
<b><i>I shall reduce that distance to zero,</i></b>

20:32.460 --> 20:36.670
<b><i>until the employer feels that he 
can trust me with his secrets...</i></b>

20:38.070 --> 20:41.200
<b><i>There are two things that 
collectors always want.</i></b>

20:41.620 --> 20:44.720
<b><i>The first is any item of extreme rarity.</i></b>

20:45.280 --> 20:49.100
<b><i>The second is colleagues to whom they 
can brag about their collection.</i></b>

20:49.980 --> 20:53.680
<b><i>He must have connections to 
other human parts collectors.</i></b>

20:54.110 --> 20:56.490
<b><i>Collectors who share their 
disgusting acquisitions,</i></b>

20:56.490 --> 20:58.370
<b><i>a network of the lowest scum.</i></b>

20:59.070 --> 21:01.070
<b><i>I'll worm my way in,</i></b>

21:01.070 --> 21:03.190
<b><i>so that I can eradicate them all.</i></b>

21:05.670 --> 21:07.860
<b>Hmm? The door won't open.</b>

21:09.070 --> 21:11.120
<b>I forgot to mention one thing.</b>

21:11.620 --> 21:14.670
<b>The barest minimum requirement 
is that you be strong...</b>

21:15.430 --> 21:20.020
<b>Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.</b>

21:39.330 --> 21:43.300
<b>Kurapika pursues his quest 
to avenge his brethren</b>

21:43.300 --> 21:45.180
<b>and to punish the Phantom Troupe.</b>

21:45.180 --> 21:49.160
<b>He prepares to step onto a new battlefield.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.570
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.610 --> 23:20.210
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.310
<b>Today, we introduce Mizuken!</b>

23:11.310 --> 23:12.580
<b>He's Kurapika's teacher!</b>

23:11.570 --> 23:14.410
<b>The person who taught 
Kurapika <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:12.580 --> 23:13.940
<b>He's classified as an Emitter.</b>

23:13.940 --> 23:16.530
<b>I guess <i>Nen</i> users are fated to meet <i>Nen</i> teachers.</b>

23:14.410 --> 23:20.210
<b>It seems he wasn't able to 
earn Kurapika's respect.</b>

23:16.530 --> 23:17.450
<b>That's what happened in our case.</b>

23:17.450 --> 23:20.090
<b>Fate had a hand in crossing our paths!</b>

23:26.370 --> 23:29.090
<b>Next Time: <i>Nen</i> x Users x Unite?</b>

23:29.090 --> 23:30.020
<b>Hey, Gon...</b>

23:30.020 --> 23:32.570
<b>Let's go break some of Milluki's figures.</b>

23:32.570 --> 23:34.310
<b>Unite for evil?</b>
