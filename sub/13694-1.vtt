00:27.823 --> 00:29.283
(ENGINE SPLUTTERING)

00:44.296 --> 00:45.463
Archie!

00:52.260 --> 00:53.470
Archie!

00:55.305 --> 00:58.599
Archie! Archie, what the hell
are you doing?

01:02.061 --> 01:03.269
Archie!

01:05.019 --> 01:06.314
Whoo-hoo!

01:09.150 --> 01:10.609
Hey...

01:10.692 --> 01:12.819
Archie, get down here now!

01:12.903 --> 01:14.780
All right, Lex! How you doing?

01:17.448 --> 01:18.656
Archie!

01:20.993 --> 01:22.410
-(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
-Archie!

01:23.578 --> 01:24.579
ARCHIE: Whoa!

02:11.868 --> 02:14.997
Archie?
Archie, are you all right?

02:15.746 --> 02:17.290
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:18.624 --> 02:22.627
Just a...slight bruising,
that's all.

02:22.711 --> 02:24.671
You could have broken
your neck.

02:24.754 --> 02:26.047
Why are you doing this?

02:27.298 --> 02:28.590
I fancied a challenge,
that's all.

02:28.674 --> 02:31.135
Well, stick to something
sensible, like...

02:31.218 --> 02:32.553
Well, like golf.

02:34.429 --> 02:36.888
-Kilwillie's been after you...
-Oh, please!

02:36.973 --> 02:40.350
I am not ready to join the
plus-four brigade just yet,
thank you very much.

02:42.894 --> 02:45.228
Archie, what has gotten
into you?

02:45.313 --> 02:47.940
The last few weeks you've been
chewing the furniture.

02:48.024 --> 02:50.651
Glenbogle's in the black,
the estate's running smoothly.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.068
I think that's just it,
isn't it?

02:52.152 --> 02:53.486
When the place
was falling apart,

02:53.569 --> 02:55.196
my job was to
keep it together.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.948
But now that's done, well...

02:57.032 --> 02:59.116
I don't know,
I just want to get my teeth
into something.

02:59.199 --> 03:03.161
Look, your job is to
look after your home,

03:03.244 --> 03:07.248
and your people,
and your beautiful wife.

03:08.374 --> 03:10.626
So no more suicidal sports,
okay?

03:10.709 --> 03:13.086
It's not that dangerous.
Honestly.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.589
Oh, but it is,
because if I catch you
up there again,

03:16.672 --> 03:17.715
I'll kill you.

03:27.057 --> 03:29.558
-Hi, Auntie Liz.
-You're late.

03:33.353 --> 03:37.148
You can take all this
down to the dump,
if the dump'll have it.

03:37.231 --> 03:40.776
-Whose is it?
-It belonged to
your Great Uncle Angus.

03:40.859 --> 03:42.486
He doesn't need it
where he's gone.

03:43.779 --> 03:45.279
What? You mean...

03:45.363 --> 03:47.031
I'm the last of the McKays?

03:47.114 --> 03:49.784
There's probably
a few in prison somewhere.

03:49.866 --> 03:52.911
I want you to strip the walls,
put on two coats of magnolia,

03:52.993 --> 03:55.914
paint the ceiling white and
white gloss the woodwork.

03:55.997 --> 03:58.540
What about the
hideous old carpet?
Is that to go?

03:58.624 --> 04:00.709
No, that was Mother's!

04:05.213 --> 04:07.423
I thought you said you'd found
an old wreck at an auction.

04:07.507 --> 04:10.759
I did. Â£25!

04:10.842 --> 04:14.721
It was lurking under
three layers of green paint.

04:14.805 --> 04:17.765
Well, I'm no expert,
but I'd say this is
a distinct improvement.

04:17.848 --> 04:19.475
It needs some specialist work,

04:19.558 --> 04:21.851
so I thought I'd take it
in to that new antique dealer

04:21.935 --> 04:25.146
in the village, you know,
William... Cox.

04:25.230 --> 04:27.564
-Knox.
-Knox.

04:27.648 --> 04:30.359
But I can still make a profit
when I sell it on.

04:30.442 --> 04:34.028
Well, I've had enough of
wandering around the garden
picking flowers.

04:34.112 --> 04:37.573
And you've been telling me
for months that I could do it
if I tried.

04:37.657 --> 04:39.992
So if it all goes pear-shaped,
I can blame you.

04:40.075 --> 04:42.786
I don't think I have
anything to worry about.
Go for it, Molly.

04:42.869 --> 04:43.954
You'll do brilliantly.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.166
It's so horrendously Gothic.
(GASPS)

04:49.250 --> 04:51.293
Even the turrets have turrets.

04:51.376 --> 04:54.087
All the homely charm
of a lunatic asylum.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.755
That's no coincidence.

04:55.839 --> 04:57.673
-Oh. Hello.
-Archie!

04:57.756 --> 05:00.301
You've finally joined
the brotherhood of
the dimpled ball.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.970
I don't have to dress
like that, do I?

05:03.052 --> 05:06.681
-Well, not if you don't have
the brio to carry it off.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

05:06.764 --> 05:09.141
Oh, I'm sorry.
You remember
my darling sister, Dorothy.

05:09.224 --> 05:11.143
She's up from the Big Smoke
for a flying visit.

05:11.226 --> 05:13.770
-You've a remarkable home.
-Oh, do you like it?

05:13.854 --> 05:16.355
I think it could use
a few more turrets myself.

05:16.439 --> 05:18.024
You know,
I was just wondering,
do you think Lexie could

05:18.107 --> 05:20.526
look after Little Sis
while I hammer you
on the fairway?

05:20.610 --> 05:22.444
Yes, of course.

05:22.527 --> 05:25.196
In fact, she's hosting
a coffee morning
for the ladies of the Glen.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.865
-You don't by any chance
have a swimsuit, do you?
-Swimsuit?

05:29.700 --> 05:32.703
Lex. This is Dorothy,
Kilwillie's sister.

05:32.786 --> 05:34.162
Morning, Dorothy.

05:34.245 --> 05:36.539
-Get your kit off.
-(LADIES GIGGLE)

05:41.335 --> 05:44.212
Now that you've restored
the family fortunes,

05:44.296 --> 05:47.131
I was wondering
if you might fancy
a modest investment.

05:47.214 --> 05:51.635
I've had rather a good idea
for a Scottish restaurant.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.804
No offence, Kilwillie,
but aren't there already
rather a lot of them?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.181
Not here, you chump,
in New York.

05:57.264 --> 05:58.933
Restaurant capital
of the world,

05:59.016 --> 06:03.436
yet sadly bereft of the joys
of haggis, neeps, wild salmon

06:03.519 --> 06:05.355
and haunch of
Highland venison,

06:05.438 --> 06:09.441
such as those supplied
by Kilwillie's
Highland Harvest.

06:09.524 --> 06:11.234
Yeah, you're right.
It's a splendid idea.

06:11.318 --> 06:14.571
-Except for the bit about me
investing in it.
-KILWILLIE: Oh, pity.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.781
Well, perhaps you'll let me
pick your brains a bit.

06:16.864 --> 06:18.699
We'll need a chap
to run the place,

06:18.783 --> 06:21.409
someone young, energetic,

06:21.493 --> 06:24.037
fond of good old-fashioned
hard work.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.288
Everything you're not,
you mean.

06:27.414 --> 06:30.376
-You put me off my shot!
-Mere gamesmanship, dear boy.

06:30.918 --> 06:32.211
(SCOFFS)

06:32.294 --> 06:35.922
So can you think of
a talented young restaurateur

06:36.005 --> 06:38.049
who fancies
a bite of the Big Apple?

06:43.512 --> 06:45.346
Sure you won't come in,
Dorothy?

06:45.429 --> 06:46.681
Water's lovely.

06:46.764 --> 06:49.809
Thank you, but hot tubs
are so last season.

06:49.892 --> 06:52.018
(LAUGHS) Not for Glenbogle.

06:52.102 --> 06:54.396
We've just got
indoor plumbing fitted.

06:54.478 --> 06:57.273
Lexie, the minutes are
getting all soggy.

06:57.356 --> 07:00.526
Let's see if Dorothy can help.
Do you take shorthand,
Dorothy?

07:00.609 --> 07:03.236
No, but I'll try to keep up
with the conversation.

07:05.613 --> 07:09.408
The next item is
the post office closing.

07:09.491 --> 07:11.076
What, Glenbogle post office?

07:11.158 --> 07:13.870
Mrs Nairn says
she's leaving in six weeks.

07:13.954 --> 07:16.080
There's no one to replace her.

07:16.163 --> 07:18.291
Where are people gonna
collect their pensions from,

07:18.374 --> 07:19.792
and their child benefit?

07:19.875 --> 07:21.835
Isn't there a post office
in Cairn Lochan?

07:21.918 --> 07:24.546
Yeah, well,
that's 22 miles away.

07:24.629 --> 07:26.131
Buses cost money.

07:26.214 --> 07:28.841
Maybe we should
encourage people
to use it more.

07:28.924 --> 07:32.428
We can maybe see
about getting, like
an internet link set up?

07:32.511 --> 07:34.470
Encouraging them
to download pornography

07:34.554 --> 07:36.139
is hardly going
to help pensioners.

07:37.348 --> 07:40.142
Dorothy! This is serious!

07:40.225 --> 07:42.978
I prefer Lady Dorothy,
actually.

07:43.061 --> 07:46.105
Mrs MacDonald
regretted post office closure.

07:47.189 --> 07:48.399
Any other business?

07:49.567 --> 07:51.234
Mmm, yes,

07:51.318 --> 07:53.820
this is an excellent piece.

07:53.902 --> 07:55.822
I could give you
a good price for it.

07:55.906 --> 07:57.823
Oh, well,
I really wanted it repaired.

07:57.907 --> 08:01.200
Do you see
there's some veneer lifted
and two handles missing.

08:01.285 --> 08:02.869
Oh, yes, we can do that
for you.

08:02.952 --> 08:05.955
-About... Â£200?
-Oh, marvellous.

08:06.039 --> 08:07.165
Right. Fine.

08:09.958 --> 08:13.879
-Now, if you'll just sign
for the work.
-Oh.

08:15.463 --> 08:17.215
Can I ask where you got it?

08:17.298 --> 08:20.259
-If you just initial
down here.
-Oh, right.

08:20.343 --> 08:22.135
-At an auction in Knockmore.
-Hmm.

08:22.219 --> 08:25.180
-I'm thinking of
selling it on.
-Really?

08:25.263 --> 08:27.932
Don't worry, Mr Knox,
I hardly count as competition.

08:28.015 --> 08:30.601
Right. Okay, well,
that's fine, Mrs MacDonald,

08:30.684 --> 08:32.144
I'll give you a phone
when it's ready.

08:32.227 --> 08:35.145
-Wonderful, thank you.
Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

08:46.072 --> 08:48.991
Is that the Cairn Lochan
Nursing Home?

08:49.075 --> 08:52.244
Yeah, you've sent us a bill
for Angus McKay,
my great uncle.

08:53.828 --> 08:56.748
Yeah, the thing is,
he's no longer with us.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.750
What you do mean,
he's with you?

09:01.085 --> 09:02.127
Oh.

09:03.044 --> 09:04.087
Oh.

09:05.255 --> 09:08.716
No, no...
It's okay, I'll get onto it.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.093
Yeah, bye.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.604
-Hi, Mrs Nairn.
-Lexie, I've just closed up.

09:24.688 --> 09:26.897
-Did you need something?
-Yeah, yeah...

09:27.898 --> 09:28.941
Actually, no, no.

09:29.024 --> 09:31.068
No, I don't need anything.
Sorry.

09:31.151 --> 09:33.069
No need to apologise, dear.

09:33.152 --> 09:37.448
-It's just that I heard
that business was a bit slow.
-Business?

09:37.532 --> 09:39.616
Business is fine!

09:39.700 --> 09:42.828
We've had to bring in
a single queuing system.

09:42.911 --> 09:45.830
There were some
very unseemly scenes.

09:45.913 --> 09:48.833
-But you're still leaving?
-We have to.

09:48.916 --> 09:52.043
We've been given six weeks
to move out of our cottage.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.755
But I thought
that you lived here,
above the shop.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.339
Oh, no.

09:57.423 --> 10:00.968
It's the size of a shoe box
up there. Terribly damp,

10:01.051 --> 10:04.345
and you don't want to see
the toilet, believe me.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.306
So who's your landlord?
Is it someone down south...

10:06.389 --> 10:08.600
We live up on Drumnagailleach.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.603
But that's Kilwillie's estate.

10:12.686 --> 10:14.146
Indeed it is.

10:14.229 --> 10:16.564
It's Lord Kilwillie
who wants us out.

10:28.699 --> 10:33.453
Oh, Lexie!
Glasgow's finest export
since the steam engine.

10:33.536 --> 10:35.330
Why are you evicting
the Nairns?

10:35.413 --> 10:37.290
-The who?
-Mrs Nairn,

10:37.373 --> 10:39.833
the postmistress in Glenbogle.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.461
I suppose you send your butler
to collect your pension.

10:42.544 --> 10:44.296
I haven't the faintest idea...

10:45.963 --> 10:48.841
Oh... I thought we had guests.

10:48.925 --> 10:51.092
Well, Lexie's here
about the Nairns.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.970
Oh, yes.
Couple that live up
at Drumna...

10:54.054 --> 10:55.222
Drumnagailleach.

10:55.305 --> 10:56.847
Bless you.

10:56.931 --> 10:59.892
-Is this your idea?
-Well, really, it's a hovel.

10:59.975 --> 11:01.268
They're much better off
somewhere else.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.436
They've lived there
for 50 years!

11:03.519 --> 11:07.148
Yes, but it faces north-east,
terrible feng shui.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.191
They're going to have
real health problems.

11:09.274 --> 11:12.819
They're going to have
real health problems when
they're sleeping in the rain.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.196
This has nothing to do
with those friends of yours,
has it?

11:15.279 --> 11:17.615
The ones who are desperate
for a Highland retreat?

11:17.698 --> 11:19.283
Of course it doesn't, Sharon.

11:20.034 --> 11:21.618
LEXIE: Hold on,

11:21.701 --> 11:25.288
you have given
one of your friends
someone else's home?

11:25.372 --> 11:27.456
I'm sure we can came
to some arrangement.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.583
Perhaps we could find them
another place to live.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.336
If they're going to cause
this much trouble,
perhaps we shouldn't bother.

11:32.419 --> 11:34.128
You can't do this, Kilwillie!

11:34.212 --> 11:35.797
We're perfectly
within our rights.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.090
No, you're not!

11:38.550 --> 11:40.509
And you won't
get away with this, Sharon,

11:41.176 --> 11:42.261
believe you me.

11:54.479 --> 11:57.898
Ah, Lex,
I have a proposition for you.

11:57.982 --> 12:00.359
Does it involve a hot bath
and a massage?

12:00.442 --> 12:03.987
-Er, no, no.
-And why not?

12:04.070 --> 12:07.699
Look, you know, they have
Turkish baths in New York.

12:07.782 --> 12:10.951
Yeah, they have Turkish baths
in Turkey.
What are you on about?

12:11.034 --> 12:14.454
Kilwillie is opening
a restaurant in New York.

12:14.538 --> 12:15.538
He needs a manager.

12:17.498 --> 12:19.417
Oh, come on, Lex,
I know it's insane

12:19.500 --> 12:22.168
but the more I think about it,
the more excited I get.

12:22.252 --> 12:24.671
It is a fantastic challenge.

12:24.754 --> 12:27.006
And what's wrong with
the challenges we've got here?

12:27.089 --> 12:28.674
What, like working
on my handicap?

12:28.757 --> 12:30.759
And who's gonna run the place?
Duncan?

12:30.843 --> 12:32.594
Well, it won't be that hard
to find someone.

12:32.677 --> 12:35.013
And if a real problem
comes up,
they can just call us.

12:35.096 --> 12:37.473
All right, okay, so,
like a problem, like, um...

12:37.557 --> 12:39.391
Kilwillie's sister wanting
to turf out Mrs Nairn?

as chewing gum
about your person?

27:08.532 --> 27:10.826
They never let me have
any in here.

27:10.909 --> 27:14.370
Well, yeah,
but is it a good idea?

27:17.331 --> 27:20.208
I just gave you
the bloody George Cross!

27:20.292 --> 27:21.960
It's no' much
of a swap, is it?

27:28.049 --> 27:29.341
How long?

27:31.218 --> 27:33.053
Would we be away for?

27:36.514 --> 27:39.266
It takes time
to build up a clientele.

27:39.349 --> 27:42.644
Well, how much time?
What, six months?

27:42.728 --> 27:44.187
More like two years.

27:48.941 --> 27:50.484
I'm not going without you.

28:07.290 --> 28:11.710
Would you believe
a grown man could spend
so much time drying flowers?

28:13.545 --> 28:16.506
-Do you take sugar?
-No, no, thanks.

28:16.589 --> 28:18.549
I didn't mean you to go
to all this trouble.

28:18.633 --> 28:19.925
MRS NAIRN:
It's no trouble at all.

28:20.008 --> 28:21.760
-I've organised a...
-A Biscuit?

28:22.511 --> 28:23.887
No, really, I...

28:25.138 --> 28:27.890
Okay, just the one.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.809
I've organised a petition
in the village

28:29.892 --> 28:31.810
and I've got people
writing to Kilwillie.

28:31.893 --> 28:34.813
I don't want people
getting into bother
on our account.

28:34.896 --> 28:36.648
Oh, they won't.

28:36.731 --> 28:38.565
Look, you have got rights.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.360
He can't just go
evicting people on a whim.

28:41.443 --> 28:44.737
-But Lord Kilwillie's letter
said...
-Don't take his word for it.

28:44.821 --> 28:47.907
-Talk to a lawyer.
-Lawyers are so dear.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.410
No, no, no.
Not if you win your case.
And you will.

28:51.493 --> 28:55.205
-I'll find you someone...
-Thanks, Lexie.

28:55.288 --> 29:00.042
I'm sorry
about the post office.
I know it's not fair,

29:00.126 --> 29:03.378
but we're too old
for all this fuss
and fighting.

29:05.422 --> 29:06.673
Do you need more milk?

29:19.308 --> 29:20.892
GOLLY: A thousand pounds?

29:20.976 --> 29:23.395
WILLIAM: Cash, aye.
GOLLY: Okay, I'll take it.

29:25.022 --> 29:26.856
WILLIAM: In fact,
a collector came in yesterday.

29:27.982 --> 29:29.650
-He was very keen.
-Yeah?

29:31.444 --> 29:34.404
-That's lucky, right enough.
-WILLIAM: It is, isn't it?

29:34.487 --> 29:36.656
An amazing coincidence,
if you ask me.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.075
Golly?

29:41.952 --> 29:44.704
Is this young man
a friend of yours,
Mr McLintock?

29:44.787 --> 29:47.331
-McLintock?
What's going on?
-Do you mind?

29:48.958 --> 29:50.083
Where did you
get that painting?

29:50.167 --> 29:51.585
From a mutual acquaintance,
okay?

29:51.668 --> 29:54.004
-Did that come from Glenbogle?
-Excuse us.

29:58.799 --> 30:00.051
You just nicked it!

30:01.052 --> 30:02.969
How could you do that?

30:03.053 --> 30:04.596
I know he's got
loads of pictures,

30:04.679 --> 30:06.765
but it doesn't mean
you can just help yourself!

30:06.848 --> 30:08.390
Hello, Andrew.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.060
Duncan, Knox is
a rip-off merchant, okay?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.228
That is rich coming from you.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.396
He swindled Molly
out of an antique dresser.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.106
We are here to wreak revenge.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.983
By selling him
an old painting?

30:19.067 --> 30:22.152
It's not
an old painting, Duncan.
It's a very new painting.

30:25.613 --> 30:28.532
-Oh, no.
-It doesn't matter, son.

30:28.616 --> 30:29.742
He was on to us, anyway.

30:29.825 --> 30:32.077
Well, all may not be
lost quite yet.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.870
You may even have
done us a favour.

30:34.788 --> 30:36.247
You said what?

30:36.331 --> 30:38.707
I told the Nairns we'd find
them a cottage on the estate.

30:38.791 --> 30:40.417
But there isn't a cottage
on the estate

30:40.501 --> 30:42.252
unless you want me to evict
somebody else!

30:42.336 --> 30:44.504
-They're our neighbours.
-You're looking to make
an issue out of this

30:44.587 --> 30:46.172
because you don't want to
talk about New York.

30:46.255 --> 30:47.757
And you're trying
to avoid this

30:47.840 --> 30:49.883
because you've already decided
you're going to New York!

30:51.009 --> 30:53.679
Look, Lex,
I know you're scared.

30:53.762 --> 30:55.013
Who said I was scared?

30:57.598 --> 30:59.558
Oh, right, okay. Well,
just take his side, then!

30:59.642 --> 31:01.268
-Lexie, I...
-She didn't take my side.

31:01.352 --> 31:03.728
She just said that
I couldn't leave without
asking your permission.

31:03.812 --> 31:05.480
I didn't say that!

31:05.563 --> 31:07.232
Molly, if you want
the place to yourself,
just say the word.

31:07.315 --> 31:09.733
Lexie, will you just tell me
what it is that I am doing
with my life?

31:09.817 --> 31:12.319
Would you just shut up!

31:12.403 --> 31:14.821
What you two really need
is a good spanking,

31:14.904 --> 31:16.698
but since
you're too big for that,

31:16.781 --> 31:19.700
I suggest you discuss it
as man and wife and
leave me out of it.

31:28.499 --> 31:31.168
Oh, Mr McLintock!

31:32.085 --> 31:33.753
Where's your young friend?

31:33.837 --> 31:36.256
He thought
I was somebody else.

31:37.215 --> 31:39.550
I disabused him
of that notion.

31:41.885 --> 31:45.888
I don't believe
you got this painting
from your mother.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.433
No, she was somebody's mother,
just not mine.

31:48.516 --> 31:51.351
-Won't she miss it?
-I've had it for over a year,
she hasn't missed it yet.

31:51.435 --> 31:53.353
Look, it's worth 10,000,
I'll take one.

31:54.021 --> 31:55.147
Five hundred.

31:56.105 --> 31:57.231
Five hundred.

32:00.526 --> 32:01.735
Five hundred.

32:04.612 --> 32:08.324
I'll take the sideboard,
plus 100 cash.

32:08.407 --> 32:10.034
for my expenses.

32:14.996 --> 32:16.080
Aye.

32:21.585 --> 32:23.170
Oh, Archie!

32:26.130 --> 32:29.425
-What's the matter?
-Well, I was wondering
if your wife was with you.

32:29.508 --> 32:33.428
-Last time I saw her,
she was rather on the warpath.
-Yes. I'm sorry about that.

32:33.511 --> 32:36.806
-That's partly the reason
that I'm here.
-Oh?

32:36.890 --> 32:38.891
I've made some
telephone calls
about the restaurant

32:38.974 --> 32:41.060
and I think I might have
found you a chef.

32:41.143 --> 32:43.103
Oh, Archie,
you've excelled yourself!

32:43.187 --> 32:45.563
I thought you were
just looking for a manager.

32:45.647 --> 32:50.734
Well, the thing is, I rather
fancied that post for myself.

32:50.817 --> 32:53.445
-For yourself?
-Please don't tell me
the job's gone.

32:53.528 --> 32:55.529
I will look a total idiot.

32:55.613 --> 32:57.323
Of course it hasn't gone!

32:57.406 --> 33:00.034
-Delighted to have you aboard,
dear fellow.
-Thank you.

33:01.326 --> 33:03.411
There is one condition.

33:03.495 --> 33:06.289
-It's about the Nairns.
-Ah.

33:06.373 --> 33:09.458
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your estate,
Kilwillie, but...

33:09.541 --> 33:11.877
Unless the Nairns
are sorted out,
then Lexie won't go,

33:11.960 --> 33:14.879
-and if Lexis doesn't go
then I can't go.
-I see.

33:14.962 --> 33:16.631
I know it's not my position
to tell you this...

33:16.714 --> 33:18.591
No, on the contrary.

33:18.675 --> 33:20.592
I'm embarrassed
that it took another gentleman

33:20.676 --> 33:22.803
to remind me
of my obligations.

33:22.886 --> 33:26.055
The matter of the Nairns
will be settled happily,
I promise.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.890
Thank you.

33:27.974 --> 33:30.309
-And you'll get Lexie
to call off the dogs?
-Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.

33:32.435 --> 33:34.229
So, you're off
to see the world.

33:34.312 --> 33:37.023
Well, New York, anyway.

33:37.107 --> 33:40.025
Oh, to be young again
and fit for the fray.

33:40.109 --> 33:42.194
Come on, you're hardly
in your dotage.

33:42.277 --> 33:45.113
-Well, I can't go gallivanting
off round the globe.
-Why not?

33:46.322 --> 33:48.116
Well, for one thing,
it's all so

33:49.533 --> 33:50.534
foreign.

33:54.037 --> 33:55.579
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

33:59.792 --> 34:01.668
Hello. Knox Antiques.

34:01.751 --> 34:04.462
Mr Knox? Simon Jenkins.

34:04.546 --> 34:07.715
-Ah, hello.
-Have you still got
my painting?

34:07.798 --> 34:09.257
Yeah, well,
it's not your painting yet.

34:09.341 --> 34:10.967
No, no, no. Of course not.

34:11.051 --> 34:12.636
I'm just about to collect
your money.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.889
I just wanted to ask you
one thing about the signature.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.766
ER Hughes. Aye?

34:19.850 --> 34:24.688
Mmm. It's just that,
I rather think

34:24.771 --> 34:28.315
that Hughes would have
signed his paintings in oil,
don't you?

34:30.025 --> 34:31.068
Eh?

34:38.741 --> 34:40.576
Magic Marker?

34:40.659 --> 34:44.621
-Something wrong?
-Aye! You two!

34:44.704 --> 34:47.956
-You conniving pair of...
-Dear me.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.416
That's no way to speak
to your customers.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.837
KILWILLIE: Oh, Marjorie...

34:57.173 --> 34:58.716
Is anything the...

35:02.344 --> 35:03.762
DOROTHY: Honestly.

35:03.845 --> 35:05.096
Next time you hire a cook,

35:05.180 --> 35:08.474
try to find one that knows
the term cholesterol.

35:08.557 --> 35:10.517
Eggs fried in butter.

35:10.601 --> 35:14.562
Why not just hang yourself?
Save the electricity.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.732
I've bally well had
just about enough of this!

35:17.815 --> 35:19.858
Don't you raise your
voice to me.

35:19.941 --> 35:23.820
You can insult my neighbours,
evict my tenants
and drive away my staff,

35:23.904 --> 35:26.322
but you will not mess
with my menu!

35:26.405 --> 35:28.240
You're making my life
an utter misery

35:28.324 --> 35:30.242
and I won't stand it,
do you hear?

35:30.326 --> 35:32.243
Sharon, don't you dare...

35:32.327 --> 35:34.913
And don't call me Sharon!

35:34.996 --> 35:38.999
(WHIMPERING) You ungrateful,
insensitive beast!

35:39.083 --> 35:41.459
If I make your life a misery,

35:41.543 --> 35:44.671
it's only 'cause
I care about you!

35:47.172 --> 35:48.508
(DOOR SLAMS)

35:51.635 --> 35:53.637
Fifty quid?

35:53.720 --> 35:56.681
Took me two days
to knock off that painting.

35:56.764 --> 35:59.683
You've done this sort of thing
before, haven't you?

35:59.766 --> 36:02.435
I've met characters
like Knox before,
if that's what you mean.

36:02.519 --> 36:04.729
GOLLY: No, no, no, it isn't.

36:04.813 --> 36:06.438
The way you ran
this whole sting.

36:06.522 --> 36:07.773
ANDREW:
You did all the work.

36:07.856 --> 36:11.026
And extremely well,
if I may say.
For an amateur.

36:12.361 --> 36:16.363
I have a...
I have a colourful past.

36:16.446 --> 36:18.283
Involving forged paintings?

36:21.285 --> 36:24.121
I like to think of them
as...homage.

36:24.621 --> 36:25.830
Homage?

36:27.331 --> 36:29.208
Is that why you moved up here?

36:29.292 --> 36:30.501
One homage too many?

36:31.626 --> 36:33.461
I moved up here to retire.

36:33.545 --> 36:34.963
Left all that behind.

36:37.923 --> 36:41.719
Do we have to talk about this,
Golly? To anyone?

36:45.263 --> 36:47.890
So the lairds have
settled the matter
like gentlemen.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.558
Lex, I've done what I can.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.393
Well, let's get out of here
before anything else
goes wrong.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.861
I'm glad that
being a laird's wife
means so much to you.

37:02.944 --> 37:04.446
Really, I am.

37:04.529 --> 37:08.741
But I don't expect my tenants
to give up their lives for me

37:08.824 --> 37:10.951
and they don't expect me
to give up mine.

37:27.590 --> 37:32.093
From now on, all work's
going to be done in house.
I've learnt my lesson.

37:32.177 --> 37:34.846
I think Mr Knox has, too.

37:34.930 --> 37:36.932
What? You don't mean
that you...

37:37.015 --> 37:40.225
It was purely poetic justice,
Molly, I assure you.

37:40.309 --> 37:42.853
Thank you both so much.

37:42.937 --> 37:44.854
It is wonderful
to have friends

37:44.938 --> 37:47.941
to protect me
from crooks and conmen!

38:03.495 --> 38:04.663
All right, Arch?

38:06.790 --> 38:08.666
Could you give us a hand
with my uncle's stuff?

38:12.294 --> 38:14.295
What is in this thing, anyway?
Gold bullion?

38:20.884 --> 38:22.552
That could do with a wash.

38:23.679 --> 38:26.389
It's the colours.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.391
My granddad died
to save this flag.

38:30.685 --> 38:33.019
What did he do in the war,
Great Uncle Angus?

38:33.103 --> 38:34.604
Bomb disposal.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.481
So is that what I think it is?

38:46.489 --> 38:47.949
Well, it can't be real,

38:48.032 --> 38:49.449
they would have taken
all the explosives out,
wouldn't they?

38:55.955 --> 38:57.206
Maybe we should check.

39:03.003 --> 39:04.671
It seems to be...

39:09.842 --> 39:12.261
Okay, don't panic.

39:12.344 --> 39:14.679
You get on the phone
and call somebody.

39:22.352 --> 39:24.813
-Telephone.
-Not the police, is it?

39:28.190 --> 39:31.276
-Hello?
-DUNCAN: Hello, Uncle Angus.
It's Duncan.

39:31.359 --> 39:34.279
-You know that trunk
you had?
-No.

39:34.362 --> 39:37.448
-DUNCAN: You do.
The big, blue metal one.
-No.

39:37.531 --> 39:39.867
The one with the flag in.

39:39.950 --> 39:41.952
Oh, that one. Aye.

39:43.244 --> 39:46.497
-Och, no!
-Och, yes.

39:46.581 --> 39:48.499
It was only a souvenir.

39:48.583 --> 39:52.210
-So it's not dangerous?
-UNCLE ANGUS: Of course not.
It's defused.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.588
I mean...

39:55.338 --> 39:57.798
I think it's defused.

39:57.882 --> 39:59.508
He doesn't know
if it's defused or not.

40:00.801 --> 40:02.302
Give it to me.

40:02.385 --> 40:04.930
Mr McKay? How do we tell
if it's still live?

40:05.013 --> 40:07.348
-Is it ticking?
-See if it's ticking.

40:08.682 --> 40:09.850
(CRASHING)

40:15.230 --> 40:16.773
When he says ticking...

40:16.856 --> 40:18.816
-Does he mean...
-Ticking like a clock!

40:21.568 --> 40:23.070
(TICKING STARTS)

40:30.284 --> 40:31.743
Well, it wasn't, but...

40:33.995 --> 40:37.164
UNCLE ANGUS: Hello.
Who is this?

40:37.248 --> 40:39.833
Mr McKay,
this is Archie MacDonald.

40:39.917 --> 40:44.337
We're stuck in the cellar
under Glenbogle
with this thing

40:44.420 --> 40:47.382
and it is ticking.
I thought that you said
it was defused!

40:47.465 --> 40:49.007
It was supposed to be defused.

40:50.008 --> 40:52.010
Someone's idea of a joke.

40:52.094 --> 40:55.012
-Look, I'm gonna hang up
and call the bomb squad.
-UNCLE ANGUS: No!

40:55.096 --> 40:57.014
They'd take hours
to get to Glenbogle.

40:57.098 --> 40:58.391
Well, how much
time have we got?

40:59.433 --> 41:00.560
About seven minutes.

41:00.643 --> 41:02.352
Seven min...

41:02.435 --> 41:05.897
Look, if you can't get out
you'll have to try
and defuse it yourself.

41:05.981 --> 41:07.314
Have you got any tools?

41:09.191 --> 41:11.902
-Yes, but...
-There's no time for buts.

41:11.986 --> 41:15.905
You can wait for it to go off
or you can try to stop it.
It's up to you.

41:15.989 --> 41:19.825
-Well, just tell me
what to do.
-Get a large screwdriver.

41:19.908 --> 41:22.703
Find the detonation cylinder.
It'll be at the front.

41:23.078 --> 41:24.246
Right.

41:25.329 --> 41:26.664
Take this.

41:35.255 --> 41:37.798
-Okay, tell him I've got it.
-Right, he's got it.

41:38.757 --> 41:42.177
Unscrew it very, very gently.

41:42.261 --> 41:44.637
DUNCAN:
Unscrew it very gently.

41:48.016 --> 41:49.474
(TICKING CONTINUES)

41:52.269 --> 41:54.062
-Okay.
-Right. He's done it.

41:54.146 --> 41:55.771
UNCLE ANGUS:
Lift out the detonator.

41:55.855 --> 41:59.066
Don't let it touch the sides.

41:59.150 --> 42:03.153
There should be three wires
between the detonator
and the bomb.

42:03.236 --> 42:07.197
Cut the, er... The red one.

42:07.281 --> 42:11.368
-(ARCHIE GROANING)
-DUNCAN: He says you've got to
cut the red wire.

42:11.452 --> 42:14.579
I can't see which
is the red one.
There's not enough light.

42:14.662 --> 42:17.332
-Hang on.
-UNCLE ANGUS: Whatever you do,
don't...

42:17.415 --> 42:19.750
-Don't what?
-Hello, Uncle?

42:19.833 --> 42:21.960
Oh, my God,
I've unplugged the phone!

42:22.044 --> 42:23.962
Duncan? Duncan!

42:24.046 --> 42:27.590
Hello. Hello, Uncle Angus.

42:27.673 --> 42:30.842
You daft wee maggot,
you near gave me
a heart attack.

42:30.926 --> 42:33.845
I said,
don't cut anything else.

42:33.929 --> 42:35.597
Here, Duncan, pass the torch.

42:38.641 --> 42:40.935
I still can't see
which one is the red one.

42:41.018 --> 42:42.769
They must have faded with age
or something.

42:42.852 --> 42:47.106
Scrape some of the
sheathing away,
but don't touch the copper.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.483
DUNCAN: Scrape the sheathing,
but don't touch the copper.

42:51.526 --> 42:52.736
(TICKING CONTINUES)

42:55.988 --> 42:58.574
Red. This one's red! Okay.

42:58.658 --> 43:00.201
Dunc, the pliers,
I can't get the pliers.

43:00.284 --> 43:02.494
He says he can't get
to the pliers.

43:02.577 --> 43:04.037
What? Oh.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.293
-Stand back.
-What for?

43:11.377 --> 43:13.211
This is insane.

43:13.294 --> 43:16.506
I know. I've got
a much better pair of pliers,
just upstairs.

43:22.219 --> 43:23.679
(TICKING STOPS)

43:25.429 --> 43:27.223
It's stopped.

43:27.848 --> 43:29.308
It's stopped!

43:30.560 --> 43:31.560
(BOTH LAUGHING)

43:35.939 --> 43:39.525
Duncan! Duncan,
pick up the phone!

43:39.608 --> 43:43.486
Uncle Angus, it's stopped,
it's stopped! You did it!

43:43.570 --> 43:47.866
Tell Archie
to put the detonator
back in, very carefully.

43:48.866 --> 43:51.034
You'll be all right

43:51.118 --> 43:53.579
as long as there's
no secondary timer.

43:53.662 --> 43:55.454
He says we'll be fine as...

43:55.538 --> 43:57.456
What do you mean
secondary timer?

43:57.540 --> 43:59.792
-(TICKING STARTS)
-It's ticking again.

43:59.876 --> 44:01.459
UNCLE ANGUS:
You've still got some time.

44:01.543 --> 44:04.546
You just need a mole wrench.

44:04.629 --> 44:06.256
We don't have a mole wrench!

44:06.339 --> 44:08.048
UNCLE ANGUS:
An adjustable spanner.
Anything.

44:08.132 --> 44:11.218
Oh, look,
we've got a screwdriver
and some sticky tape.

44:11.302 --> 44:13.803
-That's it.
-Can you flood the bomb?

44:13.887 --> 44:16.180
Or freeze it?

44:16.264 --> 44:18.433
What about
if we put some sandbags
and stuff around it?

44:18.516 --> 44:19.975
Would that do?

44:20.058 --> 44:22.227
UNCLE ANGUS: Oh, Duncan...

44:22.311 --> 44:24.354
It won't make
a blind bit of difference.

44:25.771 --> 44:27.440
I'm sorry.

44:27.523 --> 44:28.524
(TICKING)

44:29.150 --> 44:30.484
Uh, erm, no,

44:31.693 --> 44:33.236
don't be sorry.

44:34.446 --> 44:35.697
It's okay.

44:48.790 --> 44:49.791
(SIGHS)

44:53.378 --> 44:54.795
-MOLLY: Hello?
-(DOOR HANDLE RATTLES)

44:54.879 --> 44:56.547
-Archie?
-Mother!

44:57.340 --> 44:58.549
Mother!

45:00.468 --> 45:01.927
What on earth...

45:02.010 --> 45:03.470
Come on,
you get her out of here,
I'll check the house.

45:06.181 --> 45:08.682
Lex!

45:08.766 --> 45:12.186
-We're leaving now.
-And this is your idea
of a discussion, is it?

45:12.269 --> 45:13.895
Well, I'll talk
about New York, Archie,

45:13.978 --> 45:15.855
-but I'm not taking orders!
-We'll argue about it
on the way.

45:15.939 --> 45:17.690
You are so unbelievably
arrogant!

45:17.774 --> 45:19.775
For once,
would you just shut up
and do what you're told!

45:20.943 --> 45:22.653
There's a bomb in the cellar.

45:22.736 --> 45:25.821
-Oh, please.
-A great big Second World War
German bomb.

45:25.905 --> 45:28.282
Would you like me to
take you down there
and show it to you?

45:32.369 --> 45:33.370
(SHRIEKS)

45:41.085 --> 45:42.752
Where's Duncan?

45:42.835 --> 45:45.338
-Oh, he said something
about a flag.
-ARCHIE: Oh, no!

45:45.421 --> 45:49.132
-What flag?
-It was his grandfather's
regimental colours.

45:49.216 --> 45:50.926
-How long has he got?
-Well, not long.

45:51.593 --> 45:52.803
Duncan!

45:54.429 --> 45:55.638
Duncan!

46:01.852 --> 46:03.103
Come on!

46:06.398 --> 46:07.898
Come on, Dunc!

46:11.777 --> 46:13.361
-Come on!
-(EVERYONE SHOUTING)

46:13.444 --> 46:15.029
LEXIE: Come on,
it'll be all right!

46:15.113 --> 46:16.865
Come on, come on, come on.

46:18.907 --> 46:20.993
I'm sorry about the damage.
I'll pay for it.

46:21.076 --> 46:22.411
I'll sell the medal
or something.

46:22.494 --> 46:24.954
-No, that's your history.
-MOLLY: My house!

46:25.037 --> 46:27.081
-Archie?
-There might still be time
to flood the cellar.

46:27.164 --> 46:29.083
-No, Archie, no!
-This is our home, Lex!

46:29.167 --> 46:30.501
No, but we can live anywhere.

46:30.584 --> 46:32.169
We can live in...in New York.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.423
Five, four,

46:36.505 --> 46:39.341
three, two, one!

46:47.390 --> 46:49.391
Oh, sorry,
my watch is a bit fast.

47:09.992 --> 47:11.368
Is that it?

47:28.299 --> 47:29.300
(COUGHING)

47:31.885 --> 47:33.929
Unbelievable.
It's still standing.

47:51.610 --> 47:52.945
KILWILLIE: Look at her.

47:53.028 --> 47:55.571
Hardly a tile out of place.

47:55.655 --> 47:59.116
It'd take
more than one Nazi bomb
to see off Glenbogle.

48:00.076 --> 48:01.701
It made a hell of a mess.

48:01.785 --> 48:04.871
We're gonna need
a structural survey
to assess the damage.

48:04.955 --> 48:08.290
-I'll have some rooms
made ready at once.
-No, no, it wasn't a hint.

48:08.374 --> 48:11.460
My dear boy, my home is yours.

48:11.544 --> 48:13.044
ARCHIE: No,
we should be all right.

48:13.127 --> 48:15.630
As long as nobody slams
any doors.

48:15.713 --> 48:19.258
It's going to be quite a job
overseeing repairs
from New York.

48:22.135 --> 48:24.179
I'm sorry, Kilwillie, I can't.

48:24.263 --> 48:26.931
Of course you can't, old man.

48:27.014 --> 48:29.225
Never fear,
I'll find another manager.

48:29.308 --> 48:31.309
There's only one
Laird of Glenbogle.

48:33.979 --> 48:38.399
In fact, since you are
staying on to
look after your place,

48:38.482 --> 48:41.402
I was wondering
if you'd keep an eye on mine.

48:41.485 --> 48:45.321
Dorothy means well,
but she can be
afflicted with radical ideas

48:45.405 --> 48:46.781
and I'd rather think
she'd listen to you.

48:46.865 --> 48:48.740
Well, where are you gonna be?

48:48.824 --> 48:50.826
Anywhere and everywhere,
Archie.

48:50.909 --> 48:52.953
You've quite inspired me.

48:53.036 --> 48:56.539
The American West,
the Australian Outback,
the mysterious Orient.

48:56.622 --> 49:00.667
The world is my oyster and
I'm going to gulp it down
while it's still in season.

49:00.750 --> 49:01.960
Good for you.

49:03.420 --> 49:05.046
Have you, er...

49:05.130 --> 49:07.214
Have you told Mother
that you're going away?

49:07.298 --> 49:11.135
No, no, I, um...

49:11.218 --> 49:13.303
I thought
you might do that for me.

49:15.305 --> 49:17.765
You probably know
I've got something of
a soft spot for Molly.

49:18.724 --> 49:20.350
Yes, I probably do.

49:21.643 --> 49:23.270
There was a time when...

49:24.687 --> 49:26.063
Well, never mind that now.

49:27.773 --> 49:29.692
Maybe I should
step aside for a while.

49:30.859 --> 49:33.111
Hmm.
Give someone else a chance.

49:33.195 --> 49:35.071
Certainly not!

49:35.155 --> 49:38.324
I was rather hoping
that absence might make
the heart grow fonder.

49:39.450 --> 49:40.951
I'll miss you, Kilwillie.

49:42.494 --> 49:44.787
-Oh, stop it.
-ARCHIE: No, I will.

49:47.999 --> 49:49.291
I mean it, Archie.

49:50.667 --> 49:51.919
Stop it.

50:08.224 --> 50:10.392
I don't know
what came over me, Lex.

50:10.476 --> 50:13.102
I do.
I should have seen it earlier.

50:13.186 --> 50:15.522
You're just a wee boy
who craves adventure.

50:17.774 --> 50:19.608
I was until I thought
I might lose this place

50:19.691 --> 50:21.068
and realised
how much I'm part of it.

50:22.778 --> 50:23.987
So much you'd never leave?

50:25.863 --> 50:27.114
Exactly.

50:34.871 --> 50:36.372
Archie, let's just stay here.

50:39.834 --> 50:41.669
Home is where your heart is.

50:44.170 --> 50:47.257
Home is also
where the towels are.

50:48.674 --> 50:50.467
Did you forget
to bring towels?

50:50.551 --> 50:53.053
No, you forgot
to bring the towels.

50:53.137 --> 50:57.098
-Well, we're just gonna have
to make a run for it.
-Okay.

50:59.142 --> 51:01.017
-You ready?
-Yeah.

51:01.101 --> 51:03.311
-One...
-BOTH: Two...

51:03.395 --> 51:04.729
-BOTH: Three...
-Go!
