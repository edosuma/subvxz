00:01.520 --> 00:03.541
Kids, sometimes in life you see someone

00:03.541 --> 00:05.082
and you just instantly know

00:05.082 --> 00:06.823
this is the person for you.

00:06.822 --> 00:08.864
It can happen anywhere.

00:08.864 --> 00:11.147
Even the waiting room
of a tattoo removal clinic.

00:11.147 --> 00:13.922
And that's what happened when I met...

00:14.597 --> 00:15.905
...Stella.

00:20.462 --> 00:22.638
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.

00:22.638 --> 00:24.146
My bread and butter.

00:24.146 --> 00:25.988
So I'm guessing that the real story

00:25.988 --> 00:27.730
involves a bad breakup and some booze.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.171
Unless it's a gang tattoo,

00:29.171 --> 00:31.550
in which case, I think it's
time to find a new gang.

00:31.550 --> 00:32.957
No, I just thought it would be cool

00:32.957 --> 00:34.330
to get a caterpillar tattoo,

00:34.330 --> 00:36.039
and then a few weeks went by,
and all of a sudden...

00:36.039 --> 00:37.848
(laughing)

00:37.848 --> 00:40.194
Well, I can get rid of it
in ten one-hour sessions,

00:40.194 --> 00:42.841
but, I should warn you,
laser surgery's very painful.

00:42.841 --> 00:44.247
Well, I think you'll find

00:44.247 --> 00:46.157
I have a very high
tolerance for pain.

00:46.157 --> 00:48.536
Just last night, I sat through
the worst movie ever made.

00:48.536 --> 00:49.942
Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?

00:49.942 --> 00:54.163
No, the worst movie--
Manos: Hands of Fate.

00:54.163 --> 00:55.705
Uh, I'm a doctor,
went to medical school.

00:55.705 --> 00:57.380
It's Plan 9.
If you don't believe me,

00:57.380 --> 00:58.922
it's playing down
at the Pamela Theater.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.998
Uh-huh.
I don't believe you, Doctor.

01:00.998 --> 01:03.578
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

01:06.761 --> 01:08.336
Hello.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.044
Hey, Ted.
Hey.

01:10.044 --> 01:11.920
Hey, put that away.
Tonight's on me.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.294
Oh, no, no, don't...

01:13.294 --> 01:14.399
Come on, I insist.

01:14.399 --> 01:16.108
That's so nice. Thank you.

01:16.108 --> 01:17.716
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Ted.

01:17.716 --> 01:18.889
He wants to pay.

01:18.889 --> 01:20.966
Oh, wow. Oh, yay.
Wow, thank you.

01:20.966 --> 01:23.412
One, two, three, four.

01:26.226 --> 01:29.006
Is something wrong?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.916
No, it's just, um...

01:30.916 --> 01:32.558
I'm just a little embarrassed.

01:32.558 --> 01:34.132
I thought this was a date.

01:34.132 --> 01:35.975
But it's no big deal.

01:35.975 --> 01:38.018
Don't worry about it.

01:38.018 --> 01:39.593
What's wrong?

01:39.593 --> 01:43.010
Ted's embarrassed-- he
thought this was a date.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.423
Ted thought this was a date.

01:45.423 --> 01:47.600
Stella, did you know Ted
thought this was a date?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.476
What? I'm not allowed
to date a patient.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.649
It's an AMA rule.

01:50.649 --> 01:51.822
She's not allowed to date patients.

01:51.822 --> 01:52.927
It's an AMA rule.

01:52.927 --> 01:54.099
She's not allowed to date patients.

01:54.099 --> 01:55.439
It's an AMA rule.

01:55.439 --> 01:56.713
She's not allowed to date...

01:56.713 --> 01:58.622
Yeah, I got it.

01:58.622 --> 01:59.963
MAN: We all got it.

01:59.963 --> 02:01.738
Ted's a schmuck.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.648
(laughter)

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.647 --> 02:17.987
(laughing)

02:17.987 --> 02:20.130
And you bought all the tickets.
Yeah, yeah.

02:20.130 --> 02:22.208
Hey, you were right.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.391
Worst movie-going
experience ever.

02:25.391 --> 02:27.636
Of course, it had nothing
to do with the movie.

02:27.636 --> 02:29.913
I am so sorry that you
thought that was a date.

02:29.913 --> 02:31.220
No, it's fine.

02:31.220 --> 02:33.565
I got to hang out with you
on girls' night out.

02:33.565 --> 02:35.777
All right, so if you're not
allowed to date a patient,

02:35.777 --> 02:38.524
I'll just... I'll wait until
these ten session are up

02:38.524 --> 02:39.998
and then I'll ask you out then.

02:39.998 --> 02:42.041
Well, then,fair warning:

02:42.041 --> 02:43.717
I'm going to say no.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.894
Really? I'm getting mixed
signals from you.

02:45.894 --> 02:49.010
I feel like you've been staring
at my ass for quite some time.

02:50.150 --> 02:51.924
What, you're married?
No.

02:51.924 --> 02:52.929
Boyfriend?
No.

02:52.929 --> 02:54.169
Lesbian?
No.

02:54.169 --> 02:56.079
Only date black guys?
No.

02:56.079 --> 02:59.228
And yet you can say
with absolute confidence

02:59.228 --> 03:02.210
that ten weeks from now,
if I ask you out on a date,

03:02.210 --> 03:03.282
your answer will be...

03:03.282 --> 03:04.035
No.

03:05.092 --> 03:06.967
No... Hmm.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.642
What could she mean

03:08.642 --> 03:11.356
when she says no?

03:11.356 --> 03:12.729
I don't know,

03:12.729 --> 03:14.003
it is totally cryptic.

03:14.003 --> 03:16.113
This is far from over.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.687
We're talking ten weeks from now.

03:17.687 --> 03:19.531
Who knows what she'll want then?

03:19.531 --> 03:20.703
Do you know what you're going to want

03:20.703 --> 03:21.976
for lunch ten weeks from now?

03:21.976 --> 03:24.086
Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail
and a milk shake.

03:25.562 --> 03:26.935
Ted, do you know how long
it takes a woman

03:26.935 --> 03:28.878
to decide whether or not
she's going to sleep with a guy?

03:28.878 --> 03:30.218
8.3 seconds.

03:30.218 --> 03:31.223
After that,

03:31.223 --> 03:32.261
her decision is made.

03:32.261 --> 03:33.500
She will not change her mind.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.506
That's ridiculous.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.846
Is it?

03:35.846 --> 03:38.157
Describe your first
8.3 seconds with Stella.

03:39.532 --> 03:40.838
Lower back butterfly tattoo--

03:40.838 --> 03:42.814
you're up.

03:42.814 --> 03:45.561
(patients snickering)

03:45.561 --> 03:46.869
(all groaning)

03:46.869 --> 03:48.577
So we got off to a rocky start.

03:48.577 --> 03:50.688
That may be a problem for some guys,

03:50.688 --> 03:52.363
but I get better over time.
Right?

03:52.363 --> 03:54.373
I'm not some Top 40 song--

03:54.373 --> 03:55.713
easily digestible.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.153
I'm complex.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.336
I require time and multiple listens.

04:00.336 --> 04:02.078
I'm "Stairway to Heaven."

04:02.078 --> 04:06.133
Wow, Roger Daltrey just
rolled over in his grave.

04:07.473 --> 04:10.253
That's not the right guy, is it?

04:11.460 --> 04:14.340
He's not even dead, is he?

04:14.340 --> 04:15.815
I think that's great, Ted.

04:15.815 --> 04:17.656
You can do whatever you set your mind to.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.500
In fact, you've inspired me.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.978
I'm going to stop biting my nails.

04:21.978 --> 04:23.855
But, baby, you love
biting your nails.

04:23.855 --> 04:25.765
I know, but I'm doing this for Ted.

04:26.704 --> 04:27.909
Hmm.

04:27.909 --> 04:30.287
God, this is really hard.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.901
Give me ten sessions,

04:32.901 --> 04:34.341
I'm going to turn that "no"
into a "yes."

04:34.341 --> 04:35.480
Really, Ted?
Mm-hmm.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.821
You think so?
Mmm.

04:36.821 --> 04:39.266
Well, tell me, how did
the rest of that session go?

04:39.266 --> 04:41.544
This is going to hurt a little.

04:41.544 --> 04:43.521
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.

04:43.521 --> 04:46.201
This one time
I was playing tennis, and...

04:46.201 --> 04:48.278
(high-pitched screaming)

04:49.820 --> 04:53.538
Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.

04:53.538 --> 04:55.917
Everyone probably sounds like that.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.324
Doctor, are you all right?

04:57.324 --> 04:58.932
I heard a woman
screaming in here.

04:58.932 --> 04:59.685
Oh.

05:04.025 --> 05:05.230
(laughing)

05:08.045 --> 05:10.423
Here's to nine more great sessions.

05:10.423 --> 05:12.902
(laughter continues)

05:12.902 --> 05:16.320
weeks went by.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.832
The second session I told her
about how I spent a summer

05:18.832 --> 05:20.675
working with inner-city kids.

05:20.675 --> 05:24.059
The third session we both spoke
nothing but French.

05:24.059 --> 05:27.040
The fourth session
I made her laugh so hard

05:27.040 --> 05:28.883
she fell out of her chair.

05:28.883 --> 05:30.659
(laughing)

05:30.659 --> 05:33.373
So by the time the fifth
session came around...

05:33.373 --> 05:34.444
Still no.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.191
Still no.

05:37.191 --> 05:38.464
What's up with that?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.006
I mean, I juggled.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.446
You juggled?

05:41.446 --> 05:43.858
I thought you were
trying to impress her.

05:43.858 --> 05:45.199
You do magic.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.941
How is juggling
any lamer than magic?

05:46.941 --> 05:48.449
Magic's not lame.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.889
I don't get it.
I mean...

05:49.889 --> 05:51.296
Is this lame?

05:51.296 --> 05:53.741
(screams)
Oh, Barney, no, no.

05:53.741 --> 05:56.254
We said no fireballs at the table.

05:56.254 --> 05:57.829
What the hell is wrong with you?

05:57.829 --> 05:59.202
There's alcohol in here.

05:59.202 --> 06:00.242
Barney...
I...

06:00.242 --> 06:01.413
We've talked about this.

06:01.413 --> 06:02.553
It's a fire code violation.

06:02.553 --> 06:04.731
Yeah, but Ted provoked me.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.037
No, no, you are on a time-out.

06:06.037 --> 06:07.042
Go sit over there.

06:07.042 --> 06:08.717
But...
Go!

06:11.231 --> 06:13.207
Anyway... I don't get it.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.882
She should be into me by now.

06:14.882 --> 06:16.523
You know, you can do this, Ted.

06:16.523 --> 06:18.299
I said that I would
stop biting my nails,

06:18.299 --> 06:20.175
and kablam-ey.

06:20.175 --> 06:21.850
It's just a challenge.

06:21.850 --> 06:23.559
It can't be easy to woo someone

06:23.559 --> 06:25.971
while you're sticking your
naked butt in their face.

06:25.971 --> 06:27.713
Works for baboons.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.169
It's called "presenting."

06:32.169 --> 06:33.777
I got four sessions left.

06:33.777 --> 06:36.021
Ther-There's got to be
an angle I'm not seeing.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.266
You can't turn a "no"
into a "yes," Ted.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.272
Can't be done.

06:39.272 --> 06:40.444
I don't know, Barney.

06:40.444 --> 06:42.320
I mean, sometimes
persistence pays off.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.325
I said "yes" eventually.

06:43.325 --> 06:44.899
No, you didn't.

06:44.899 --> 06:46.340
You were like, "No, we
can't, we're friends.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.217
It would mess up the
dynamic of the group."

06:48.217 --> 06:49.724
To Ted.

06:49.724 --> 06:50.964
Oh, right.

06:50.964 --> 06:52.170
Wait a second.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.811
Wait a second,
I got the angle.

06:53.811 --> 06:55.553
Sir, please don't yell at me,

06:55.553 --> 06:57.027
because when people yell at me,

06:57.027 --> 06:58.904
I have a tendency to start crying.

06:58.904 --> 07:00.980
Please don't do it.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.556
Abby, I've told you before.
Please.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.431
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

07:04.431 --> 07:06.208
...how difficult it
is for me to... Go on,

07:06.208 --> 07:07.682
you can do this, hang up.

07:07.682 --> 07:08.955
Abby,

07:08.955 --> 07:10.228
hang it up.

07:10.228 --> 07:13.477
I am too busy
to waste my time...

07:14.483 --> 07:16.492
I'm sorry, I just wish

07:16.492 --> 07:18.905
that some of the patients
would be nicer to you.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.512
The receptionist.

07:20.512 --> 07:21.518
That's my way in.

07:21.518 --> 07:22.590
I like this.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.265
Seduce the receptionist.

07:24.265 --> 07:25.705
That's a great plan.

07:25.705 --> 07:27.046
That's not the plan.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.721
And how would that help me
with Stella?

07:28.721 --> 07:30.229
Who?

07:30.229 --> 07:32.239
Here's the plan.

07:32.239 --> 07:34.618
(whistles)

07:34.618 --> 07:36.661
Hi. Here.

07:36.661 --> 07:37.799
I stopped--

07:42.189 --> 07:43.428
Hi, I stopped for coffee

07:43.428 --> 07:45.305
and I... and I thought
I'd grab you something.

07:45.305 --> 07:47.449
Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice.

07:47.449 --> 07:48.454
You're like a knight.

07:48.454 --> 07:51.067
I should call you Sir Ted.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.173
What?

07:52.173 --> 07:53.579
Nothing. Nothing.

07:53.579 --> 07:55.858
(laughing nervously):
It's really stupid.

07:55.858 --> 07:57.800
Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.811
Thanks. Thanks, Abby.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.836
And now we wait.

08:04.836 --> 08:06.377
And sure enough,

08:06.377 --> 08:08.890
by session seven, she saw me
in a whole new light.

08:08.890 --> 08:11.771
Okay, I'm about
to break my big rule here.

08:11.771 --> 08:13.011
Break it.

08:13.011 --> 08:15.088
Okay.

08:15.088 --> 08:16.730
Abby goes bowling

08:16.730 --> 08:18.673
with her church group
every Wednesday night...

08:18.673 --> 08:21.353
Mm-hmm. ...and she really wanted
to invite you, but she's too shy.

08:21.353 --> 08:23.531
(clicks tongue)

08:23.531 --> 08:24.736
Abby is...?

08:24.736 --> 08:27.719
My receptionist.

08:27.719 --> 08:29.461
You really made
quite an impression on her

08:29.461 --> 08:30.935
with the coffee the other day.

08:30.935 --> 08:32.876
I mean, she has really
not stopped talking about you.

08:32.876 --> 08:35.256
Oh, Abby.

08:35.256 --> 08:37.467
I thought you said "Alan."

08:37.467 --> 08:40.416
But you just said, "Abby is...?"

08:40.416 --> 08:41.957
Right.

08:41.957 --> 08:44.302
Right, I thought I said "Alan."

08:44.302 --> 08:45.776
Who's Alan?

08:45.776 --> 08:48.456
Who's Abby?

08:48.456 --> 08:50.567
My receptionist.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.531
Exactly.

08:56.095 --> 08:57.535
What is happening?

08:57.535 --> 08:59.009
(groaning):
Ted.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.287
You just got to be
yourself, no more gimmicks.

09:01.287 --> 09:03.465
You're right, no more gimmicks.

09:03.465 --> 09:04.705
One more gimmick.

09:04.705 --> 09:06.280
TED:
You know what's on her shelf?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.759
That self-help book
The Power of Me.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.769
(all groaning)
I know, I know, but I thought

09:10.769 --> 09:13.650
if I read it, maybe we'd have
something new to talk about.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.426
(all groaning)

09:15.426 --> 09:16.699
It's actually a great book.

09:16.699 --> 09:19.044
It taught me the power
of complete memory.

09:19.044 --> 09:20.384
Can I borrow your copy?

09:20.384 --> 09:22.528
I left it somewhere.

09:22.528 --> 09:23.935
I forget.

09:25.377 --> 09:26.130
Hi.

09:27.991 --> 09:29.429
Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

09:29.429 --> 09:33.651
Hi, Ted.
I'll let her know.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.437
Telepathically?

09:37.437 --> 09:39.045
(laughing):
That's funny.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.284
That's funny, smart, and great.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.640
I am so sorry that I am late.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.282
I have, like, two minutes
for lunch everyday.

09:46.282 --> 09:47.756
It's crazy. Yeah, I understand.

09:47.756 --> 09:50.570
I was just, uh, checking
out the old bookshelf here.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.480
I see you've read The Power of Me.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.824
It's funny...What? Oh, no.

09:54.824 --> 09:57.839
No, no, no, no, no, I would
never read that piece of crap.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.884
Some patient left it here.

09:59.884 --> 10:01.055
Oh, thank God.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.228
(chuckling):
I couldn't agree more.

10:02.228 --> 10:03.602
That's total crap.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.311
I see people reading that
on the subway

10:05.311 --> 10:07.522
and I just want to shout,
"Get a life, people!"

10:07.522 --> 10:09.264
Ted, I found your book.

10:09.264 --> 10:10.336
What?

10:10.336 --> 10:11.676
Your book The Power of Me.

10:11.676 --> 10:13.116
I think you accidentally
dropped it in the garbage.

10:13.116 --> 10:14.289
What? No, that's...
that's not mine.

10:14.289 --> 10:15.529
I've never seen that before
in my life.

10:15.529 --> 10:17.539
No, you were reading it
in the lobby.

10:17.539 --> 10:19.314
Wha-- no, you have me confused
with someone else.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.487
No, no, look right here.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.732
"From the personal library
of Ted Mosby."

10:22.732 --> 10:24.507
That's you.

10:26.987 --> 10:29.164
Ted, I hate to say this,

10:29.164 --> 10:32.213
but I think it's "nail
the receptionist" time.

10:32.213 --> 10:33.788
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.

10:33.788 --> 10:35.798
Ted, every little boy
wants to grow up

10:35.798 --> 10:37.473
to nail the doctor or the lawyer.

10:37.473 --> 10:40.153
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.

10:40.153 --> 10:41.996
No. I like Stella.

10:41.996 --> 10:43.638
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ted.

10:43.638 --> 10:46.552
Your little Stella is not so perfect.

10:46.552 --> 10:47.490
What do you mean?

10:47.490 --> 10:48.997
I went down there

10:48.997 --> 10:51.208
and checked her out for myself.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.448
Yeah.

10:53.421 --> 10:54.894
And while I was down there,

10:54.894 --> 10:57.340
I discovered that she had a secret,

10:57.340 --> 11:01.326
a terrible... terrible secret.

11:01.326 --> 11:02.532
What?

11:02.532 --> 11:03.739
What is it?

11:05.750 --> 11:07.725
Hold on, I gotta pee.

11:11.947 --> 11:13.756
Okay, I'm back.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.598
What's going on at work?

11:15.598 --> 11:17.039
What's the big secret?!

11:17.039 --> 11:18.379
Oh. Oh, right.

11:18.379 --> 11:20.289
Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.

11:20.289 --> 11:21.428
Sure, what's it regarding?

11:21.428 --> 11:22.936
Oh, I just want to see her.

11:22.936 --> 11:24.879
Want to look at her,
see what she looks like.

11:24.879 --> 11:26.922
I-I don't understand.

11:26.922 --> 11:28.463
I'm sorry, did I accidentally

11:28.463 --> 11:30.340
oprima numero dos when I called?

11:30.340 --> 11:32.250
Do you speak English?

11:32.250 --> 11:34.426
I want to see her!

11:34.426 --> 11:36.169
Sir, please don't yell at me

11:36.169 --> 11:37.643
because when people yell at me,

11:37.643 --> 11:39.285
I have a tendency to start crying.

11:39.285 --> 11:40.290
What are your credentials?!

11:40.290 --> 11:41.496
Please don't do that. Please.

11:41.496 --> 11:43.338
I want to know who am I speaking with!

11:43.338 --> 11:45.750
BARNEY: At first she seemed
great, beautiful, smart,

11:45.750 --> 11:47.560
way out of your league.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.235
But then, I overheard this conversation.

11:49.235 --> 11:50.742
...my grandfather's name--
I was the last-born so...

11:50.742 --> 11:52.753
Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?

11:52.753 --> 11:53.925
No.

11:53.925 --> 11:55.266
(sighs)

11:55.266 --> 11:57.946
When am I going to kick
this folliculaphilia?

12:04.345 --> 12:06.087
Folliculaphilia?

12:06.087 --> 12:08.332
Folliculaphilia.

12:08.332 --> 12:09.806
What is that?

12:09.806 --> 12:12.285
Ted, your perfect woman

12:12.285 --> 12:16.037
can only be attracted
to men with moustaches.

12:18.383 --> 12:21.330
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.871
That's not real.

12:22.871 --> 12:25.351
You're right, Ted.
I'm just making that up.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.762
I know that you are
because there's no such thing.

12:28.768 --> 12:31.347
I got it a little bit.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.455
Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

12:39.455 --> 12:41.532
Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.509
You look like a young Tom Selleck,

12:43.509 --> 12:45.151
only a million times handsomer.

12:47.363 --> 12:50.477
Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you.

12:50.477 --> 12:51.818
Just kidding.

12:51.818 --> 12:53.894
Stupid.

12:55.236 --> 12:56.776
Sorry I'm late.
Typical two-minute lunch.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.456
So we are very close to getting...

12:59.456 --> 13:02.438
(laughing)

13:04.147 --> 13:05.386
(cackling)

13:05.386 --> 13:08.100
Why? Just why?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.813
Y-you don't remember?

13:10.813 --> 13:12.722
I'll bet anyone ten bucks

13:12.722 --> 13:15.504
I can get Ted to grow a moustache.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.050
Uh... okay.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.467
You sabotaged my next to last
chance with Stella

13:21.467 --> 13:23.041
for ten dollars?

13:23.041 --> 13:26.592
I know. I would've done it for free.

13:26.592 --> 13:28.603
But, no. You owe me ten bucks.

13:28.603 --> 13:32.824
This is awful.
My-my tenth session is next week.

13:32.824 --> 13:34.968
I'm gonna ask her out,
and she's gonna say

13:34.968 --> 13:38.520
the most demoralizing syllable
in the English language-- no.

13:39.526 --> 13:40.496
You know what?
Just forget it.

13:40.496 --> 13:41.703
I'm not even gonna ask her.

13:41.703 --> 13:43.545
No, you have to. She likes you.

13:43.545 --> 13:45.019
She said so herself.

13:45.019 --> 13:46.460
(clearing throat)
I mean...

13:46.460 --> 13:48.536
Oh, my God,
you went and saw her, too.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.748
I swear to you, I did not.

13:56.143 --> 13:58.990
My wife's always getting
on me about my dry elbows.

13:58.990 --> 14:00.698
So good to be in
a relationship.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.038
Anyone special
in your life?

14:02.038 --> 14:03.915
Or maybe just someone
you're interested in?

14:03.915 --> 14:06.795
Interes-ted in?

14:09.209 --> 14:11.151
You know, we should really
get this mole checked out.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.457
It's just a little irregular.

14:12.457 --> 14:15.975
MARSHALL:
Irregular? Oh, my God.

14:15.975 --> 14:17.550
This is it. It's all over.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.091
One of my patients has this

14:19.091 --> 14:20.799
little butterfly tattoo
at the bottom of his back.

14:20.799 --> 14:23.681
Can you stop talking about
your other patients?!

14:23.681 --> 14:25.858
I'm dying here, woman!

14:25.858 --> 14:28.102
There you go. Look, even if it is something,

14:28.102 --> 14:30.381
it's easily treatable, so try to relax.

14:30.381 --> 14:31.822
Okay.

14:31.822 --> 14:33.396
Hey, what was it you were saying before

14:33.396 --> 14:35.038
about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?

14:35.038 --> 14:37.551
Oh, that... that's nothing.

14:37.551 --> 14:39.025
It's just a little crush.

14:39.025 --> 14:42.241
So I will be calling
you with your results.

14:42.241 --> 14:43.514
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.669
Oh, sir, your book!

14:49.378 --> 14:50.148
No.

14:50.148 --> 14:51.085
Yes.

14:51.085 --> 14:53.967
She said "crush"?

14:53.967 --> 14:56.547
And she was talking about me?

14:56.547 --> 14:59.260
NARRATOR:
That last session was the least painful of all.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.477
I savored every searing blast
of that laser.

15:02.477 --> 15:04.051
All done.

15:04.051 --> 15:07.334
The moment I'd waited
ten weeks for had arrived.

15:07.334 --> 15:09.043
Stella...

15:10.316 --> 15:13.867
...now that I'm
no longer your patient,

15:13.867 --> 15:15.944
would you like
to have dinner with me?

15:19.630 --> 15:21.405
Ted, you're a really nice guy...

15:21.405 --> 15:23.248
Oh, no.

15:23.248 --> 15:25.827
It has been so great
getting to know you.

15:25.827 --> 15:27.436
I am gonna kill Marshall.

15:27.436 --> 15:29.110
I've had so much fun
these last ten weeks.

15:29.110 --> 15:31.958
Oh, my God, this is worse
than the laser.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.835
I have a daughter.

15:34.874 --> 15:36.314
What?

15:36.314 --> 15:38.023
Her name's Lucy.
She's eight.

15:38.023 --> 15:42.009
Work and being with her,
that's pretty much my life.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.617
My social calendar

15:43.617 --> 15:45.091
is movie night with the girls
once a month

15:45.091 --> 15:46.532
when I can get a sitter.

15:46.532 --> 15:48.978
I mean, I've been to one party
in the past year--

15:48.978 --> 15:51.189
St. Paddy's Day--
it was awful, I left early.

15:51.189 --> 15:53.400
But, really, my only free time

15:53.400 --> 15:55.578
is the two minutes
I get for lunch, so...

15:55.578 --> 15:56.884
this is why I don't date.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.766
Ted, I only have time

15:59.766 --> 16:02.513
for one most important person
in my life, and that's Lucy.

16:03.887 --> 16:05.393
Anyway, it's been fun.

16:05.393 --> 16:08.140
Next time, think before you ink.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.553
But if you ever do wake up with, like,

16:10.553 --> 16:15.110
a dolphin tattoo on your ankle,
just give me a call.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.073
There it is--

16:21.073 --> 16:22.379
she's a mom.

16:22.379 --> 16:24.657
It's just not gonna happen.

16:24.657 --> 16:26.634
Sorry, dude.

16:26.634 --> 16:28.108
Have a shrimp.

16:28.108 --> 16:29.449
I'm good.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.229
I guess I got no one but myself to blame.

16:32.229 --> 16:33.569
She told me right from the start

16:33.569 --> 16:36.986
she was gonna say no and sure enough...

16:36.986 --> 16:39.064
Wait a minute.

16:43.487 --> 16:45.328
Hi.
Hi.

16:45.328 --> 16:46.903
You didn't actually say no.

16:46.903 --> 16:48.679
What do you mean?

16:48.679 --> 16:50.455
All this time you were, uh,
you were supposed to say no,

16:50.455 --> 16:52.632
but you didn't--
I checked the transcript.

16:52.632 --> 16:53.972
(laughs)

16:53.972 --> 16:55.546
So, here's what I'm proposing.

16:55.546 --> 16:57.222
Uh... You only have two minutes, right?

16:57.222 --> 16:58.093
Right.

16:58.093 --> 16:59.935
Okay. You want to, uh...

16:59.935 --> 17:01.711
go on a a two-minute date with me?

17:03.487 --> 17:05.932
Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.880
Um... Okay.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.603
Great.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.541
And... go.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.619
Taxi!

17:17.894 --> 17:19.299
Hello!

17:19.299 --> 17:20.505
Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...

17:20.505 --> 17:21.578
I know.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.195
That's like 120 seconds.

17:25.195 --> 17:26.871
380 West 22nd, please.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.546
And step on it.
We're in a hurry.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.289
380 West 22nd? That's...

17:33.171 --> 17:34.107
Ha-ha!

17:34.107 --> 17:35.213
Right this way.

17:35.213 --> 17:36.922
(laughing):
Thank you, sir.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.468
You know, I have always
wanted to try this place.

17:39.468 --> 17:41.143
House salad.
Oh.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.617
So, college?

17:42.617 --> 17:43.824
Stanford.

17:43.824 --> 17:44.929
Uh-huh. Wesleyan.

17:44.929 --> 17:46.604
Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?

17:46.604 --> 17:48.647
No. Scott Crable?
Mm-mm.

17:48.647 --> 17:50.657
Eggplant parmesean.

17:50.657 --> 17:52.400
Thanks.
Oh, already cut up. Nice.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.840
Could we get
the check please.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.214
We're trying to make a movie
in 15 seconds.

17:55.214 --> 17:56.755
Of course.  Okay, great.

17:56.755 --> 17:58.196
Uh, how do you want
to do this?

17:58.196 --> 17:59.301
You had the eggplant parm.

17:59.301 --> 18:00.843
I only really
had water so...

18:00.843 --> 18:02.853
I'm kidding.  Oh.

18:02.853 --> 18:04.260
Okay. Let's go.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.370
Taxi! You nervous?

18:06.370 --> 18:07.845
A little bit. You can't tell at all.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.017
Oh, good. Yeah.

18:09.017 --> 18:10.424
Hello!

18:17.126 --> 18:19.001
384 West 22nd.

18:20.208 --> 18:21.748
15 seconds. The movie's started.

18:21.748 --> 18:23.356
Nah, previews. We'll be fine.

18:26.707 --> 18:28.516
Ah! Just in time.
It hasn't started yet.

18:28.516 --> 18:29.789
So, what are we seeing?

18:29.789 --> 18:30.995
Manos: Hands of Fate.

18:30.995 --> 18:32.000
The whole thing?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.541
Only the important parts.

18:40.443 --> 18:42.184
Worst movie ever.

18:42.184 --> 18:44.865
Yeah, I almost walked  out, like, five times.

18:44.865 --> 18:46.740
How we doing on time? Taxi!

18:46.740 --> 18:47.880
We got a little time.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.354
Okay. Do you want to walk it?

18:49.354 --> 18:50.359
Why not?

18:50.359 --> 18:51.565
Hello!

18:51.565 --> 18:54.144
Good-bye!

18:54.144 --> 18:55.384
So what grade's your daughter in?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.390
Third grade.

18:56.390 --> 18:57.595
Ah! That's a good year.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.606
Yeah, she's wonderful.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.548
I just wish that I could get her to quit
smoking, you know?

19:01.548 --> 19:03.090
What?  I'm kidding.

19:03.090 --> 19:06.273
Oh. Look,
coffee and dessert?

19:06.273 --> 19:08.417
You know, this neighborhood
just keeps on changing.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.092
This used to be a cute,
little Italian restaurant.

19:10.092 --> 19:11.432
I know. New York.

19:11.432 --> 19:13.543
It's a living organism,
an ever-changing tapestry.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.285
Ooh, look at the time.

19:15.285 --> 19:16.491
Let's go.

19:16.491 --> 19:17.864
Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.

19:19.038 --> 19:20.210
Flowers?

19:20.210 --> 19:21.516
I'm allergic.

19:21.516 --> 19:24.665
Okay. See?
We're getting to knock other.

19:24.665 --> 19:27.211
Stella, I had a lovely--

19:27.211 --> 19:29.188
Doggy bag?

19:29.188 --> 19:31.366
Stella, I had a lovely time.

19:31.366 --> 19:32.740
Me, too, Ted.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.449
And... date.

19:34.449 --> 19:36.023
(chuckles)
Huh?

19:36.023 --> 19:37.362
That wasn't so bad, right?

19:37.362 --> 19:39.909
No lengthy, awkward silences.

19:39.909 --> 19:41.484
Dessert ran a little long, so...

19:41.484 --> 19:43.728
I had to cut the good-night kiss.

19:45.002 --> 19:47.681
I think I can be late just once.

19:58.604 --> 20:00.010
Ted...

20:00.010 --> 20:02.925
Look, I I uld love
to have a second date, I would.

20:02.925 --> 20:05.772
But I understand that you really
don't have time right now,

20:05.772 --> 20:08.386
but if you ever do,
will you give me a call?

20:08.386 --> 20:09.726
Yes.

20:09.726 --> 20:10.765
Okay.

20:13.949 --> 20:15.958
And that, kids, is how you turn a "no"

20:15.958 --> 20:17.331
into a "yes."

20:21.855 --> 20:23.864
All my friends told me,
"Abby, be strong.

20:23.864 --> 20:25.071
He doesn't deserve
another chance."

20:25.071 --> 20:26.276
No, no, no.
But I forgive you!

20:26.276 --> 20:28.354
No, no, no, no!

20:32.375 --> 20:33.814
then he just kept

20:33.814 --> 20:35.422
toying with my emotions.

20:35.422 --> 20:37.064
Wow.

20:37.064 --> 20:39.275
This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk.

20:40.314 --> 20:41.352
You know your problem?

20:41.352 --> 20:42.860
You're too sweet.

20:42.860 --> 20:45.037
Aren't you going to see
the doctor about that mole?

20:45.037 --> 20:46.344
Oh, yeah.

20:46.344 --> 20:47.919
Turns out it's just
a Raisinet.

20:49.026 --> 20:51.168
Hey, how would you like

20:51.168 --> 20:53.547
me to take you out to a fancy restaurant

20:53.547 --> 20:55.792
and then go on a shopping spree?

20:55.792 --> 20:58.137
Treat you the way
you should be treated.

20:58.137 --> 21:00.549
Would that make you forget
about that Ted monster?

21:00.549 --> 21:02.358
My mom was wrong.

21:02.358 --> 21:04.168
There are nice guys in New York.

21:05.341 --> 21:07.384
We just have to go
by my hotel room first.

21:07.384 --> 21:08.925
My bed was broken.

21:08.925 --> 21:10.399
I just have to make sure
they fixed it.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.074
Well, then if it's fixed,

21:12.074 --> 21:14.385
can we can have sex on it
and then go shopping.

21:16.564 --> 21:18.272
I like you.
