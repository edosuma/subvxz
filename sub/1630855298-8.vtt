WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:08.508
- Thanks for meeting,
all right?

00:08.550 --> 00:10.343
I know everyone's busy,
and we've been trying

00:10.385 --> 00:12.178
to make this happen
for a while.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.972
The reason you're all here

00:14.014 --> 00:17.517
is because I am a big fan
of your content.

00:17.559 --> 00:23.189
One of you has the chance to be
our next new breakthrough star

00:23.231 --> 00:26.484
of our "Based on a True Story"
spinoff.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.279
Now, I'm looking for someone
that America can relate to.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.156
We need a sad story--

00:31.197 --> 00:34.200
maybe cancer,
maybe a dead sister.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.494
Just think, like,
"American Idol."

00:36.536 --> 00:37.662
Go.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.122
- My parents died
in a car accident.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.290
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- I have diabetes.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.000
- My mom abused me.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.418
[together]
Me too. Me too.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.879
- Yeah, well, I mean, guys,
no surprise there, right?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.923
[phone rings]
If, uh--hey, I am so sorry.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.633
One second.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.676
[clears throat]

00:51.718 --> 00:52.886
Oh, hey, how are you?

00:52.927 --> 00:54.179
- You fuck!
- You fucking psychopath!

00:54.220 --> 00:55.597
- We've been calling you
for an hour.

00:55.638 --> 00:56.681
- What is wrong with you?
- Why aren't you picking up?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.308
We called you ten times
in an hour.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.810
- Guys, guys, guys,
one at a time, please, people.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.480
- Okay. You said you weren't
gonna kill anyone.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.939
- Uh, no.

01:04.981 --> 01:08.151
What I think I said was,
I wasn't gonna kill Michelle.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.694
- Oh, my God!

01:09.736 --> 01:11.488
- I don't want
to use the word "hero,"

01:11.529 --> 01:14.407
but she was gonna turn you in.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.992
- What?
- How do you know that?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.243
You don't know that.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.286
- How do you think I know,
Nathan?

01:18.328 --> 01:19.371
She told me.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.747
She called the cops.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.415
- Oh, that's bullshit.
You--you know what?

01:22.457 --> 01:23.833
We can't believe a word
that you fucking say, Matt.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.918
That's the thing.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.086
- Why did you frame me
with the dart?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.170
- Yeah!

01:27.212 --> 01:28.463
- We're supposed to be
partners.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.673
- Nathan,
if I wanted to frame you,

01:29.714 --> 01:31.257
I'd have dumped her body
on Sunset Boulevard,

01:31.299 --> 01:32.258
all right?

01:32.300 --> 01:33.468
I just want you to know

01:33.510 --> 01:35.679
that I could frame you
if I ever wanted.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.097
- Okay,
here's what you're gonna do.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.348
You're gonna get
your ass over here,

01:38.390 --> 01:40.141
and you're gonna clean this up.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.268
- Uh--oh, you mean the body?

01:42.310 --> 01:43.770
[clicks tongue]
Yeah, no.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.979
That's on you guys.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.356
- What--uh, I'm sorry.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.608
We're not gonna dispose
of Ruby's fucking body.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.943
Are you out of your mind?
- All right,

01:49.984 --> 01:52.445
but, uh, she's gonna start
to stink up the place,

01:52.487 --> 01:55.115
and your new fancy
Malibu neighbors

01:55.156 --> 01:58.034
are gonna be up your ass.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.577
All right, I'm back.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.537
So sorry.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.455
Any more trauma?
Keep it coming.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.540
- Fucker!
- Okay. He can't hear us.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.541
Just call him back.
Call him back.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.127
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.545
Oh, my God.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.796
[phone rings]
- Guys, keep 'em coming.

02:09.838 --> 02:10.797
Write 'em down.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.923
I'll be one sec.

02:12.757 --> 02:13.883
Hello.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.468
- Um, we can't--
- No, we can't do this.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.053
Please,
you have to come help us.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.430
We can't do this.
- Please, Matt, please. Please.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.473
- Ah, Jesus Christ.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.225
It's like dealing
with children.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.727
All right, fine.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.937
Meet me at your place
in an hour.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.938
- Our place? No, we're not--

02:26.980 --> 02:27.897
we're not meeting at our place.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.149
Absolutely not, no.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.483
- It's totally cool.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.361
I'll just--I'll hang with Tory.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.529
- What?
- Uh, no.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.823
- No.
- You will not hang with Tory.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.866
- Don't be late.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.243
Bring the body.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.121
- Oh, my God.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.415
- We're fucked.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.209
[suspenseful music]

02:48.251 --> 02:49.794
- Okay.

02:49.836 --> 02:56.760
* *

03:07.145 --> 03:08.313
[sighs]
She's gonna be okay.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.397
He's not gonna do anything.

03:09.439 --> 03:16.571
* *

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
Try her again.
- I'm calling.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.458
[line trilling]

03:28.500 --> 03:30.669
- Hi, it's Tory.
Leave a message.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.212
- Voice mail again.
Oh, my God.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.797
He's gonna kill her.
- He's not.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.048
Don't say that.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.050
He's not gonna--he's not
going to kill her, okay?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.093
- He's gonna kill her.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.427
[horn honks]
- Move!

03:39.469 --> 03:46.601
* *

03:50.689 --> 03:51.815
- Got the keys?
- Yeah. Let's go.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.358
- Okay. Okay.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.610
Okay, okay. All right.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.444
Come on.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.531
* *

03:59.572 --> 04:00.573
- Tory.
- Tory?

04:00.615 --> 04:01.950
- Tory? Hey.
- Tory.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.076
- Tory.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.370
all: Surprise!

04:05.412 --> 04:08.289
Happy anniversary!

04:08.331 --> 04:10.166
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Hi.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.168
- Oh, my God, hi!
- Hey.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.211
- Are you surprised?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.879
- Yes!
- Ah, what a surprise.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.339
[indistinct chatter]

04:16.381 --> 04:17.716
- How you doing, buddy?
- Hey.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.719
- Oh, my God, yes,
I almost gave birth.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.180
- We got you so good.
- We got you good.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.265
- Okay, wait, get together.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.558
Smile.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.268
Cute.
Say "ten years."

04:28.309 --> 04:29.269
- Yeah, you can frame that.
- Cute.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.770
- Oh, my God.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.022
- I don't know what he said
to get you guys here,

04:32.063 --> 04:34.524
but he guaranteed
it would be on the dot.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.734
- I kept my promise, right?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.068
- What did he say to you guys?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.611
- Oh, you don't want to know.
- Yeah.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.405
- It was crazy.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.115
Yeah. Yeah.
- We had to race here.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.283
- You know what?

04:43.324 --> 04:44.492
You're gonna get me back.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.286
- We sure are, yeah.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.954
- I have to pee.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.164
- Guys...
- Yes.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.123
- Thank you.
- And then this is gonna be--

04:50.165 --> 04:51.332
we're gonna party.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.459
- What a night
we're gonna have here.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.877
Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.128
I'm gonna be right back.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.464
- Oh, hi. Look at you.
- Hey, great to see you.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.090
- What are we gonna do?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.342
- We act normal.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.468
- Oh, act normal.
- Yeah.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.635
- Okay, cool.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.304
Act normal
with Ruby's fucking body

05:04.346 --> 05:06.890
in the trunk of our car?

05:06.931 --> 05:08.016
- Fucking nuts.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.142
- How did he know?

05:09.184 --> 05:10.560
How did he know that she knew?

05:10.602 --> 05:11.811
- I have no idea.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.563
- Like, I--
- Hey, guys.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.315
- Get out there right now
and take care of the body.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.983
- Hey, it's a party.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.320
- Get your ass out there
right now and fucking fix this.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.654
- Guys, I really think

05:21.696 --> 05:22.864
you need to fix this
yourselves.

05:22.906 --> 05:23.740
- Yeah?

05:23.782 --> 05:26.993
- And when you do--bonus--

05:27.035 --> 05:29.954
I figured out how
we can protect the spinoff

05:29.996 --> 05:32.123
from the woke police.
both: What?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.501
- We're gonna make
the spinoff inclusive.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.960
- Okay, I can't talk about this
right now.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.838
- Hey, would you just
hear me out?

05:38.880 --> 05:39.839
Thank you.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.341
Right,
so what we're gonna do is,

05:41.383 --> 05:42.509
we're gonna give a voice

05:42.550 --> 05:44.594
to the marginalized
serial killers--

05:44.636 --> 05:46.388
the BIPOC killers,
the disabled killers.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.391
We are gonna take their voice,
and we're gonna raise it up.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.725
- Marginalized serial killers?
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.060
- Are you fucking insane?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.603
Where would you even find
those people?

05:53.645 --> 05:54.729
- We have a chat room.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.064
It's kind of like
an affinity group.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.357
- Huh,
'cause it kind of sounds like

05:57.399 --> 05:58.733
a forum for terrible people.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.360
- It's a safe space where

06:00.402 --> 06:02.529
people can trade stories,
talk craft.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.614
- Dead body right
in the fucking driveway.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.075
- You have lost your mind.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.118
- Really?

06:08.159 --> 06:09.536
Because I've already had
some Zooms,

06:09.577 --> 06:11.496
and the response is amazing.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.373
- Oh, my God, you've--
you've had some Zooms?

06:13.415 --> 06:14.708
That's so great.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.042
Did you guys also make
some TikTok videos,

06:16.084 --> 06:17.377
you and your little
killer friends?

06:17.419 --> 06:18.378
Do a little couple dances
together?

06:18.420 --> 06:19.504
Let me tell you something.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.630
There's not gonna be a spinoff.

06:20.672 --> 06:21.881
There's not gonna be
a universe.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.174
Nothing.
- All right, fine, fine.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.301
All right, fine. Fine.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.344
You don't have to do it.
- Great.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.303
- All right.
- Fantastic.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.304
- Yeah, I don't need you.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.514
I'll do it on my own.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.515
- What?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.017
- The hell you will.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.059
This was my idea.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.061
I created this podcast.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.980
* *

06:37.022 --> 06:39.274
- I am the podcast.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.109
- Hey, guys?
- Hey, Tory.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.110
- Hey, Tor.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.236
- Hi.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.113
Um, someone crashed the party.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.281
- What?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.575
[indistinct chatter]

06:48.616 --> 06:51.327
[clears throat]

06:51.369 --> 06:55.248
- Hey, here's the happy couple.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.167
[laughs]

06:57.208 --> 06:59.544
Can I talk to you outside?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.587
- Yeah.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.505
[tense music]

07:02.547 --> 07:04.090
Sure.

07:04.132 --> 07:09.637
* *

07:15.185 --> 07:16.519
- I don't know
what you're doing here.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.437
- Yeah.
- You weren't invited.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.521
- I know.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.440
I know, and look,
I totally get it.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.400
I just thought that
we've been friends so long--

07:22.442 --> 07:23.360
- Give me a fucking break.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.527
You shot my dog, Simon.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.653
- No, I know.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.614
And I am really, really sorry.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.074
- Are you sorry
you put a gun to my head?

07:29.115 --> 07:30.533
Sorry about that?

07:30.575 --> 07:32.369
- I can't even believe
that I did that.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.412
It's like--
- The fuck is wrong with you?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.747
- I think
I just fucking lost it.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.833
And this whole
open marriage bullshit,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.795
it's just--it's just been
eating away at me, Nathan.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.798
And I--I just--like, I--

07:44.839 --> 07:46.716
I think I was just doing it
to be cool.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.093
And I'm not.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.135
It's just not me.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.220
- I don't care.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.097
- Thank God
Ruby and I worked it out.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.640
[tense music]

07:53.682 --> 07:55.058
- You worked it out?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.102
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah, we're doing great.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.771
Just had to hit reset,
and she's gonna come here.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.106
She'll tell you.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.941
But we're not gonna fuck
around on each other.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.485
We got a new dog, Duke Jr.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.945
- Are you kidding me?
Duke Jr.?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.030
You can't just pretend
this didn't happen.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.240
- Oh--
- You shouldn't be here.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.658
You weren't invited.
- Okay, I get it.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.118
- You should leave, okay?
- No--

08:13.159 --> 08:14.619
- 'Cause I'm starting to get
really fucking pissed off,

08:14.661 --> 08:15.578
Simon.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.122
Let me make this up to you.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.666
Uh, I'll get a house in Belize,

08:19.708 --> 08:22.085
and we'll get the whole gang
together, you know? We'll--

08:22.127 --> 08:24.963
- Yeah, that's the thing
about you, Simon.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.633
You think you're better
than me, but you're not.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.846
[cell phone ringing]

08:36.349 --> 08:37.267
- You hear that?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.769
- No.

08:39.811 --> 08:40.729
- Is that a phone?

08:40.770 --> 08:41.771
- What?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.440
I don't hear anything.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.359
[ringing continues]

08:47.986 --> 08:49.487
- That--there's a phone.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.031
It's, uh--
- I don't think so.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.034
Maybe it's coming
from across the street?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.452
- No, it's definitely not.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.870
It's definitely, uh...

08:56.911 --> 08:59.205
[ringing continues]

08:59.247 --> 09:01.332
it's definitely coming
from in here.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.960
Yeah. Let's open it.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.545
You got the keys?
- They're inside.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.921
Hey, don't worry about it.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.506
- Whoa, what if somebody's
trapped inside?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.342
Get the keys.
- Hey, hey, look.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.802
You know what?

09:12.844 --> 09:14.804
Let's put that stuff
in the past, okay?

09:14.846 --> 09:16.348
You and I are cool.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.141
Come back inside.
- Really?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.935
- Yeah, we are--
we're totally cool.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.103
Let's put it behind us.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.146
- Oh.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.357
- I've done
some crazy shit too.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.816
- Yeah.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.610
- [groans]

09:28.651 --> 09:30.320
[sighs]

09:30.362 --> 09:31.821
- What about
the prenatal classes?

09:31.863 --> 09:33.198
How are they?
- You know what?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.449
I never went.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.450
- Girl...
- Yeah, no.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.826
- But it's, like, showtime.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.995
- Well, um, kind of.
Not really.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.122
- Well, look, has anyone
told you about the guy?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.707
- The who?
- The shit guy.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.542
- The shit guy.
- The what?

09:44.584 --> 09:45.835
- No, I mean,
you're gonna shit on the table,

09:45.877 --> 09:47.170
and that's okay.
- Okay, quiet.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.005
- He's gonna wipe it--
- Okay, guys, you know,--

09:49.047 --> 09:51.925
- And the diapers,
the big, giant vagina diapers.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.301
- Oh, huge.
- All right,

09:53.343 --> 09:54.344
you know what, guys?
Maybe we can stop talking--

09:54.386 --> 09:55.512
- With the ice inside.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.222
- It's like a snowman
is going down you.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.641
- Your pussy is gonna be
on ice for weeks, months.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.184
- Well, this is a great party.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.852
- You got a guy in the kitchen
putting edibles up his ass.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.437
- Right up his ass.
- Oh, my God.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.523
- I would do that.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.149
Uh, give me one second, okay?

10:08.191 --> 10:09.859
Bye.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.277
We're not ready for this, baby.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.696
- Ruby's phone is ringing
in the trunk.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.780
- What?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.532
- Yes, come on.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.033
- Seriously?

10:17.075 --> 10:19.994
You left her phone
in her pocket in the car?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.329
Are you nuts?
- I'm sorry.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.872
It's my first time
dealing with a dead body.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.041
- Oh, my God.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.376
Oh, God, I can't look at her.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.919
* *

10:27.961 --> 10:30.463
- Okay, how do you turn
this fucking thing off?

10:30.505 --> 10:31.756
- Don't turn it off.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
- The cops can
fucking track us.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.051
- I'm sure this thing
has been pinging

10:35.093 --> 10:36.720
every cell tower
since we left Malibu.

10:36.761 --> 10:37.971
We'll deal with that later.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.431
We have to see if Matt's
telling us the truth.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.640
- Okay.

10:40.682 --> 10:41.683
Well, do you have the code?

10:41.725 --> 10:43.059
- Uh, no.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.269
- All right, well,
what do you want to do?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.396
- Oh, my God.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.480
Uh...

10:47.522 --> 10:49.024
okay, okay.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.110
Just, uh--oh, my God,
move her face towards me.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.862
- Okay.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.282
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.700
Oh, it worked.
- It worked.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.036
- Okay. All right, I'm gonna
check if anyone's called.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.456
Uh, unknown caller.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.249
There's a voice mail
seven minutes ago.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.668
- Play it.
- Okay. Okay.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.254
- Now, this is a message
for Ruby Gale.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.214
Detective Quincy Burrell
of the LAPD

11:13.256 --> 11:15.425
Westside Ripper Task Force
returning your call.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.260
- Oh, my God.
- It sounds like you have

11:17.302 --> 11:18.345
very relevant information.
- Shit.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.387
- She did call!

11:19.429 --> 11:20.221
She was gonna turn us in!

11:20.263 --> 11:21.598
- Here's my personal cell.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.849
310-700...

11:22.891 --> 11:24.059
- What did she tell them?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.894
- Fuck.
- 5647.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.771
- Fucking mother--
relevant information?

11:27.812 --> 11:30.231
What kind of fucking relevant
information do they have?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.776
- She was gonna make baby
an orphan.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.819
- What are you guys doing?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.821
- Hey.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.448
Turn it off, turn it off,
turn it off.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.326
Yeah, we're coming!

11:44.788 --> 11:45.789
[glass dinging]

11:45.830 --> 11:47.207
- Okay, speech time.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.126
Everybody come in
from the kitchen, please.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.712
- God, I love a speech.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.047
- [clears throat]

11:54.089 --> 11:56.007
- You know,
you're a fucking asshole.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.343
You left the fucking phone
on her on purpose.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.427
- Yeah.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.595
I wanted to throw you
in the deep end,

12:00.637 --> 12:01.888
see if you could swim.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.098
- Guys, shut the fuck up.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.557
- Simon was out there.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.642
What if he saw something?

12:05.684 --> 12:07.185
What if he knows
her fucking ringtone?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.104
- Well, then we take care
of Simon.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.898
- When does this end?

12:11.940 --> 12:14.567
- Well,
that's the beauty of it.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.403
Never ends.

12:17.696 --> 12:21.074
- All right, okay.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.703
So I don't really know
if anybody knows this,

12:24.744 --> 12:30.083
but Ava and Nathan
kind of saved my life.

12:30.125 --> 12:35.005
Um, our mom died when I was 10,

12:35.046 --> 12:39.300
and Ava was living
out here with Nathan.

12:39.342 --> 12:45.056
And I got stuck with my dad
and step-monster in Chicago,

12:45.098 --> 12:49.686
and I kind of wanted
to blow my brains out.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.647
So I called Ava,

12:52.689 --> 12:57.027
and she drove cross-country,

12:57.068 --> 13:01.281
picked me up,
and brought me here.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.910
She and Nathan gave me
a life and a home

13:05.952 --> 13:09.622
and a family.

13:09.664 --> 13:14.252
You guys always
looked out for me,

13:14.294 --> 13:20.133
and that baby is so lucky
to have you guys as parents.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.135
Seriously.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.386
Am I right?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.972
all: Yes.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.432
- I love you.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.808
- Love you.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.227
Thank you.
[laughs]

13:31.269 --> 13:34.814
- Happy 10-year anniversary

13:34.856 --> 13:37.442
to Ava and Nathan.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.694
[together]
To Ava and Nathan.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.029
- Ow, ow!

13:41.071 --> 13:42.989
- All right, let's party.
[bottle pops]

13:43.031 --> 13:44.491
- Bye. Thank you.
- Yeah, take care.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.368
Thank you. Hey, buddy.
Thanks--thanks for coming.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.869
- Bye. Thank you so much.
- Oh, buddy.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.871
- Bye. Too many ass gummies.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.081
- They are really
kicking in now.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.165
- Wow.
- Nathan.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.500
- You okay to drive?
- Yep.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.794
- We'll see.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.045
- All right.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.838
- Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.882
- Guys?

14:00.924 --> 14:03.176
I got you
an anniversary present.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.262
[foreboding music]

14:06.304 --> 14:13.436
* *

14:23.154 --> 14:24.572
Have fun.

14:24.614 --> 14:29.869
* *

14:29.911 --> 14:31.996
[elevator dings]

14:32.038 --> 14:35.625
- Okay.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.252
- Okay.
Come on, let's go.

14:37.293 --> 14:44.426
* *

15:01.317 --> 15:08.450
* *

15:12.328 --> 15:14.330
- Thank God
for the pickleballers.

15:14.372 --> 15:19.711
* *

15:24.215 --> 15:27.344
- [grunting]

15:32.640 --> 15:34.351
- Are you sure this is okay?

15:34.392 --> 15:38.480
- Yeah, they're gonna
cement it tomorrow.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.316
Cameras haven't worked here
in years, so it's perfect.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.280
[sighs]

15:47.322 --> 15:49.866
[grunts]

15:49.908 --> 15:52.494
- How come we never talk
about the baby?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.996
- We talk about the baby.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.540
- Uh, no, we don't.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.669
We haven't even bought anything
for this little human.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.046
I mean,
we don't have a stroller

16:03.088 --> 16:05.382
or car seats, diapers--nothing.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.051
Don't you think
that's a little bit weird?

16:08.093 --> 16:11.012
- I guess.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.098
Uh...

16:13.139 --> 16:14.432
I mean, I'm super excited.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.395
[gentle music]

16:18.436 --> 16:21.189
But I'm fucking terrified.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.982
[sighs]

16:23.024 --> 16:24.818
- Yeah, me too.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.529
- [laughs]

16:27.570 --> 16:31.700
I just want to be a good dad.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.536
I don't wanna let you down.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.038
- You could never let me down.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.708
- Ava, come on, you've been--

16:39.749 --> 16:41.584
you've been so excited
these last few months.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.547
You're so--you're so alive.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.091
It's because we're finally
getting somewhere, right?

16:48.133 --> 16:49.342
- Yeah, but for me,

16:49.384 --> 16:51.052
it was never about
getting somewhere.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.431
It was about being together,

16:54.472 --> 16:57.142
connecting again
like we used to, you know?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.020
That's literally
all I ever wanted.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.355
* *

17:02.397 --> 17:03.857
- That's all I wanted.

17:03.898 --> 17:08.361
* *

17:08.403 --> 17:09.446
Let's do this.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.449
[tense music]

17:12.490 --> 17:15.201
* *

17:15.243 --> 17:16.911
- Wow.
- [grunts]

17:16.953 --> 17:19.497
* *

17:19.539 --> 17:21.416
- Oh, God, good job.

You know, we--we met

We were so young.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.982
She was just, like,
the coolest girl in the room.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.484
Everyone wanted to be
around her,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.569
but we just--I don't know.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.197
We just, like,
bonded and sat in a corner

17:52.238 --> 17:53.782
