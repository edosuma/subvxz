00:02.536 --> 00:03.437
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...
Think fast.

00:03.537 --> 00:04.905
What's up, man?

00:07.741 --> 00:10.344
One of my cops arrested a female
for shoplifting.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.213
He may have used

00:12.313 --> 00:13.414
an excessive amount of force.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.049
<i>Gabe Finley.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:16.984
High number of CCRB complaints
against him.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.219
I want him on the day tour.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.387
That way, we can
keep an eye on him.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.489
I've got an undercover--
Sean Dryden.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.691
You suspect I'm less
than genuine when I'm with you?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.160
You've lived a double life
long enough for me to wonder.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.528
Yeah. Who are all
these tough guys?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.197
Oh, I hired a chef.
<i>The New Yorker</i>

00:29.297 --> 00:30.398
had a thing on him.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.465
Yeah, does he have a name,
Corinne?

00:31.565 --> 00:32.733
<i>George Pappas.</i>

00:32.833 --> 00:33.901
I locked him up.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.603
Finley's got to stay
on a late tour.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.506
You can have the late tour
platoon commander monitor him,

00:38.606 --> 00:40.341
but, uh, you can't move him.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.143
<i>And that union trustee has</i>

00:42.243 --> 00:43.911
nothing to do with it?

00:44.011 --> 00:47.047

Wow.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.160
I can't believe you're back.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.661
Good morning, Inspector.

02:07.761 --> 02:11.299
Oh, let me take this in
for a second.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.302
I, uh, didn't know
if I'd ever get the chance

02:14.402 --> 02:17.838
to see you reporting for duty
again, and now that you are,

02:17.938 --> 02:21.275
I can't tell you
how happy that makes me.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.743
I'm happy to be back.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.645
So, the doctor says
you're fit for duty,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.647
Psych Services says
you're fit for duty.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.317
What do you say?
Absolutely fit for duty.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.618
And you would say
if you weren't?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.152
Yes, I would.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.821
Yeah, I understand
you want to get back out there.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.823
I would urge you
to just...

02:35.923 --> 02:40.261
watch for signs that may
tell you you're not as ready

02:40.361 --> 02:41.595
as you think you are.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.331
I-I will. Okay. Uh, yeah.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.833
You promise?
I promise.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.502
It's good to have you back.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.172
It's good to be back. All right. Okay.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.612
Morning, Captain.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.914
Bentley, welcome back.

03:01.014 --> 03:01.982
Let me guess.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.651
You're about
to tell me you <i>like</i>

03:03.751 --> 03:05.519
working on a desk.
No, sir.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
No shame in it.
Not at all.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.490
It's possible,
after all these years,

03:09.590 --> 03:13.661
you might actually <i>like</i>
being a house mouse.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.663
I know there are
vital functions performed

03:15.763 --> 03:16.897
by members of the service

03:16.997 --> 03:18.432
inside the confines
of the precinct.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.901
Members of service like myself?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.736
Yes, sir.
But that's not you.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.673
No, sir.
No. Your place
is on the street.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.874
For 26 years.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.410
You realize that your actions

03:29.510 --> 03:31.612
might have resulted
in a considerably

03:31.712 --> 03:33.381
longer stretch of modified duty?

03:33.481 --> 03:37.184
Yes, sir.
Were it not for the influence
of Chief Suarez,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.686
you might have been suspended.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.020
Hell, you could've been fired.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.089
I-I know...

03:42.189 --> 03:43.757
my punishment
was far more lenient

03:43.857 --> 03:45.326
than what could have been.

03:45.426 --> 03:49.563
Well, I think you've earned
such consideration.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.999
I'm just an old war horse, Captain.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.634
Saddle up.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.286
Thinking about taking some
of the vacation days

04:12.386 --> 04:13.421
I have saved up.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.523
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, go someplace warm.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.525
Oh, yeah? Mm.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.092
My folks have a condo
in Saint Croix.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.094
If they're not using it,
you're welcome to it.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.796
Don't you have to clear it
with them first?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.332
What? You're gonna
trash the place?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.966
Hell, yeah, I'm gonna...

04:26.066 --> 04:29.870
No, I ain't gonna
trash the place.
So it's no problem.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.405
7-4-David.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.808
Respond to a 30 with a firearm
at 8384 New Lots Avenue.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.410
4-Eddie backing up.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.316
Here we go.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.126
Hey. Hey. Hey, we're in here.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.962
You hear that?
We're inside the vault
behind the...

04:55.062 --> 04:57.865
Police. Anybody in there?
Hello!

04:59.500 --> 05:00.701
We're in the vault
behind the counter!

05:00.801 --> 05:02.202
The lock's busted.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.405
4-David to Central.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.374
Be advised the victims
are locked in a vault.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.643
We're gonna need ESU over here
to get it open. Over.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.345
4-David, we copy.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.723
All right, we're good.
Yeah, go for it.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.725
Go on.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.360
Oh, thank you so much.
You guys, go. Go.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.762
Go, go, go, go, go!

05:30.698 --> 05:31.865
Damn.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.775
We're starting to get
a detailed report

05:41.875 --> 05:43.310
of what he thinks is missing.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.815
This your place?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, Jamal.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.352
What's your last name, Jamal?
Jamal Hayes.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.187
You call in that there was
a robbery in progress?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.023
I had a gun to my head.
I saw one of my customers

05:56.123 --> 05:57.324
in the window.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.992
He must have called it in. Okay.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.361
This is Jamal Hayes.
He owns the place.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.063
Hello.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.532
Officer Haywood.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.833
That's "Inspector."

06:05.933 --> 06:07.535
Oh, do I know you?

06:07.635 --> 06:08.802
You're one of the cops

06:08.902 --> 06:10.337
that arrested me
for selling marijuana.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.640
When did I do that?
2007.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.207
I was in Narcotics.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.644
Sold six and a half ounces
of herb,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.078
and did four-and-a-half years
in Elmira.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.680
Well, there was
a mandatory minimum sentence

06:19.780 --> 06:21.014
in effect back then.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.184
Yeah, laws were different
back then, right?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.920
Okay, can you ID, uh, the person
who robbed you, Jamal?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.723
Uh, everything happened so fast.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.058
I didn't get
an eye on them.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.626
If you could give us height, build,

06:32.726 --> 06:33.827
anything about their
physical description,

06:33.927 --> 06:36.396
that might help.
Nine millimeter.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.165
That's all I saw was a gun.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.568
What they take?
Almost everything. I mean,

06:40.668 --> 06:43.336
all the cash
that I had on hand.
Yeah, how much was that?

06:43.437 --> 06:45.439
$85,000.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.476
Had a scheduled pickup
for later this afternoon.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.243
All right, let us do our thing.
With jobs like this,

06:50.343 --> 06:52.680
we sometimes zero in
on a suspect pretty quick.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.181
Won't matter.

06:54.281 --> 06:58.185
I lose that much cash,
I'm wiped out.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.820
Again.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.958
What a tragedy, huh?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.027
One less place to buy weed.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.929
I'd say a guy who spent
four-and-a-half years in prison

07:09.029 --> 07:11.198
for doing what now isn't even
a misdemeanor

07:11.298 --> 07:13.066
deserves some kind
of consideration.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.470
Treat it like an armed robbery.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.805
Just leave it at that.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.307
Yes, boss.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.526
Two dispensaries in
our precinct, two dispensaries

07:38.626 --> 07:39.960
in the 8-2,
one dispensary in the 8-9.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.029
It has been deemed a pattern, Inspector.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.430
All hit by three-man crews

07:43.531 --> 07:45.465
wearing hoodies,
armed with handguns.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.001
From the amount reported
stolen, it looks like

07:48.101 --> 07:49.670
these dispensaries were all hit

07:49.770 --> 07:51.138
when there was a fair amount
of cash in the till.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.973
Yeah, given the amount
of people smoking weed,

07:53.073 --> 07:54.675
there might always be a fair
amount of cash in the till.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.343
There is a new city agency

07:56.443 --> 07:57.945
that's serving
as a clearing house

07:58.045 --> 07:59.747
for legalized cannabis sales.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.516
You should check with them and
see who's listed as licensees.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.951
Yeah, city agency.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.186
Established solely
for the purpose

08:06.286 --> 08:07.521
of people who want
to get loaded.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.422
Well,
it's a pretty universal desire.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.024
Yeah, but does that mean
we got to cater to it?

08:11.124 --> 08:13.561
Sorry, Father Killian.
Forgive us, for we have sinned.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.795
Yeah. Where do you stand

08:14.895 --> 08:16.597
on this, Inspector?
I don't like it.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.900
More young people'll be
getting high, driving high.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.603
But I'm not saying
that I want them in prison.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.872
I have no doubt
that there will be

08:24.972 --> 08:27.541
unintended consequences
from the legalization.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.777
What's crazy is, you're the one
who collared this guy

08:29.877 --> 08:31.979
for intent to distribute.
I know.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.314
Why he was given priority
in being granted a license.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.516
Which isn't to say that
four-and-a-half years in prison

08:36.617 --> 08:38.385
is a good trade-off.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.220
Yeah. No, it's not.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.689
None of us had a choice.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.558
The old drug laws didn't do
anyone any favors.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.001
Right in here, sir.
Thank you.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.603
Uh, give me a moment
alone with the chief.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.237
Ronnie, would you mind
bringing the car around?

08:57.337 --> 08:58.872
Yes, sir.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.373
You making the rounds
at the borough here, Raymond?

09:00.473 --> 09:02.275
One of my favorite things to do

09:02.375 --> 09:05.478
is to get out into the field,
meet the people where they live,

09:05.579 --> 09:08.716
take the pulse of this dirty
little town, and, of course,

09:08.816 --> 09:11.451
check in with those
I rely on to keep me apprised.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.854
Well, it seems like
not much gets past you.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.388
You must have quite a few
of those around here.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.557
I want one.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.927
To be successful in politics
long-term, you need someone

09:20.027 --> 09:22.562
you can trust to tell you
what you don't want to hear.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.665
There's a lot of smart people
hanging around the halls

09:24.765 --> 09:26.099
of city government, John.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.169
A lot of people who smile
out their mouths,

09:29.269 --> 09:30.503
but in the end,
are too invested

09:30.604 --> 09:32.139
in their own careers
to be counted on.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.675
Wow. That's, uh,
quite a wind-up.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.744
What's the pitch?

09:36.844 --> 09:40.681
I'm officially announcing my run
for mayor.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.583
I get elected,
I want you for P.C.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.953
Bad idea.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.154
Why?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
I'm a two-star chief.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.059
You'd be jumping me
over the heads

09:52.159 --> 09:54.427
of three-star chiefs,
a four-star chief.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.896
Plus, if you wanted
to go outside

09:55.996 --> 09:58.666
the department,
at least-- I don't know--

09:58.766 --> 10:00.333
a half dozen
police commissioners

10:00.433 --> 10:02.069
from other cities
who would do you

10:02.169 --> 10:03.871
a hell of a lot more
political good than I would.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.140
First Puerto Rican
police commissioner.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.142
Oh.
I'd say that does me a lot
of political good.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.978
That's a demographic that
you're really worried about?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.580
It's about building bridges
between communities.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.053
I don't know
that I want to play that role.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.722
And I don't know
that I'm going to win,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.490
but since
it's just you and me talking,

10:23.590 --> 10:26.093
could I ask you
to at least be open to it?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.862
As long
as that's all you're asking.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.497
Okay.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.665
Someone I'd like you to meet.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.201
Ah, ah.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.704
Allison, would you mind
stepping in for a minute?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.106
Allison Cha,

10:39.206 --> 10:40.640
Chief Suarez.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.676
Allison is a very important
addition to our team.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.511
She cut her teeth on some tough
political campaigns.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.113
Worked for Carville,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.314
interned for Bob Strauss.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.682
Hmm.
Knows when to cut and run.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.017
Knows when to come out swinging.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.219
Very nice to meet you, Chief. Pleasure.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.755
Now, I have some official duties
to take care of,

10:54.855 --> 10:57.524
but I wonder
if I can impose upon you

10:57.624 --> 10:59.226
to give Allison a crash course
in the current

10:59.326 --> 11:00.961
state of affairs regarding
crime and policing.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.563
I've got a pretty full day here.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.266
Perhaps we can schedule this,
uh, at another time?

11:06.366 --> 11:09.502
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Once
the announcement goes public,

11:09.602 --> 11:10.838
things are gonna move fast...
Of course.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.106
I will call your office
and schedule.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.978
Okay. Remember where you were
this morning, John.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.881
This is where it all
got started. Thank you.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.326
So, you, um... you smoke weed
every day, or just

11:33.426 --> 11:34.928
when you're kicking it
with the Snoop Dogg, huh?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.629
Do a little... (whistles) Yeah?

11:36.730 --> 11:38.198
Look, as long as you know

11:38.298 --> 11:39.733
when they're going to be doing
the drug tests, right,

11:39.833 --> 11:41.134
so you can use a masking agent.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.737
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you been sitting here long?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.741
So, sale of marijuana is legal
under state law,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.176
but not under federal law.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.978
Yeah,
and this is interesting why?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.512
Most dispensaries don't
accept credit cards.

11:52.612 --> 11:53.981
Sales are in cash,
so the night before

11:54.081 --> 11:56.349
they make a deposit,
there's a lot of cash on hand.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.751
Yeah, actually,
Detective Redundant,

11:57.851 --> 11:59.352
we kind of knew that already.
Well, I'd maybe

11:59.452 --> 12:01.855
try and figure out who knows
when those deposits get made.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.024
Oh, would you now?
We're heading over to the office

12:04.124 --> 12:06.493
of Cannabis Management
to go through

12:06.593 --> 12:07.828
the list of licensees.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.596
Let me know if I can help.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.266
How long are we stuck
with him?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.944
The website is designed
to log in

12:24.044 --> 12:25.578
cannabis dispensaries'
inventory,

12:25.678 --> 12:27.247
payroll and banking records.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.017
These are the listed owners,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.052
dates and times
of scheduled delivery.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.686
Who has access to this website?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.355
People authorized by the agency.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.590
Law enforcement, obviously.
Yeah, let's see what you got

12:37.690 --> 12:39.059
for, uh, Royal Kush.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.631
Named licensees and investors.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.067
Look who's one of the investors.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.040
♪ Ice cold whispers
breathing down my neck ♪

12:53.140 --> 12:54.908
♪ And I feel
the air get thicker ♪

12:55.008 --> 12:56.643
♪ Lungs contracting... ♪

12:56.743 --> 12:58.278
Why are you doing this?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.380
The guy's listed as an investor
of a place that got robbed.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.882
That not reason enough?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.951
You've had it in for this guy
since day one.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.953
You think maybe
my girlfriend hiring him

13:06.053 --> 13:08.255
had something to do with that?
Hiring him, by the way,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.891
without asking me to vet him,
without asking my opinion?

13:10.991 --> 13:13.593
How dare she have
been so independent.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.128
You know, this is why I don't
talk to you about these things.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.764
You talk to me about them
all the time.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.433
You wanted to see me?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.035
You know someone
named Jamal Hayes?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.137
Uh-huh.
You were locked up

13:24.237 --> 13:26.473
at Elmira together.
What's going on?

13:26.573 --> 13:28.575
Has to do with an investigation.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.010
Yeah, I think we need to, uh,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.079
take a ride over
to the precinct, George.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.747
Uh, we're setting up
for lunch. Can this wait?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.917
No. I'm sorry, honey.
There anything

13:37.017 --> 13:39.119
I can do to convince you
I'm not a criminal anymore?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.154
Probably not.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.457
Hey.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.127
There's a real good reason
for this, right?

13:47.227 --> 13:49.662
We'll see.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.805
So, you advanced
Jamal Hayes $25,000

13:58.906 --> 14:01.641
to get him started
in the dispensary business.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.444
So where'd he stand
as far as paying it back?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.246
I wasn't worried about it.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.381
That's not what I asked you.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.020
He paid it down about $5,000.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.822
What was the vig?
There was no vig.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.224
That's pretty
generous of you.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.825
You could've put that money
on the street

14:18.926 --> 14:20.460
and been making three,
four points.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.162
I consider Jamal
a friend, all right?

14:22.262 --> 14:24.464
I wasn't gonna make
that money off him.
Hmm, but you did

14:24.564 --> 14:25.732
take a piece of his business.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.300
And he was in on
the ground floor as far as

14:27.400 --> 14:28.936
legal marijuana dispensaries, right?

14:29.036 --> 14:30.837
I think
he stood to make a good living.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.940
I think he stood
to make a killing.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.774
Which means
you stood to make a killing.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.077
And if your good friend Jamal

14:37.177 --> 14:38.745
wasn't coming across
with a piece of the action,

14:38.845 --> 14:42.015
is it possible that you'd go
in there and take it yourself?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.752
That's-that's not what I did,
that-that's not what I would do.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.387
Hmm.

14:55.462 --> 14:59.432
Oh, it looks like you racked up
a few moving violations.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.169
And now, there's a warrant.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.771
If you call my parole
officer, he'll confirm

15:04.871 --> 15:07.174
that I cleared
any outstanding warrants.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.477
But in the meantime,
I have to hold you.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.045
So why don't you, uh,

15:12.145 --> 15:14.081
turn around
and assume the position?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.318
Got any weapons

15:18.418 --> 15:20.187
or anything sharp on you?

15:20.287 --> 15:22.956
Can I talk to you?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.993
Why don't you have a seat?

15:34.001 --> 15:35.468
What are you doing?

15:35.568 --> 15:36.836
This guy's behind that robbery.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.271
There's no evidence of that.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.441
That's what we do now--
find the evidence.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.023
Chief.
Regina.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
You need me for something?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.626
I heard it was Officer Bentley's
first day back at work

15:59.726 --> 16:01.561
so I wanted to stop by
and wish him well.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.463
He's on patrol right now,
but can 10-2 him if you want.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.032
Oh, nah,
that's-that's not necessary.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.266
Okay.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.501
Regina?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.106
I know you think I was wrong

16:13.206 --> 16:14.907
to stop you from putting
Officer Finley on a desk.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.344
We have a disagreement
about that.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.611
But I wouldn't want it

16:18.711 --> 16:21.614
to overshadow
our working relationship

16:21.714 --> 16:23.316
that we've built up
over the years.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.785
I don't want that, either.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.257
You making any headway on that
pattern of dispensary robberies?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.391
Some.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.126
Keep me in the loop.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.927
Okay.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.471
Hey. How you doing, Jamal?

16:44.571 --> 16:45.905
I'm all right.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.807
Yeah, we understand
that you might've been behind

16:47.907 --> 16:49.642
in your payments
to George Pappas, that right?

16:49.742 --> 16:53.246
Yeah. I was gonna make a payment
out of the 85 they took from me.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.981
And was Pappas
leaning on you?

16:55.082 --> 16:56.716
I wouldn't say that.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.352
Were you counting on him
to be infinitely patient?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.188
He knows I'm good for it.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.622
What are the chances

17:02.722 --> 17:04.291
he was behind the robbery,
Jamal?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.126
Zero.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.862
I'd trust George
with my life.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.533
Ah. Easy Wind
Cannabis Dispensary

17:13.633 --> 17:15.635
on Rockaway and Livonia
just got stuck up.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.270
Yeah, that's the 8-2.
Yeah. No.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.473
A security guard thinks he might
have hit one of the perps.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.776
We need to survey
area hospitals. Thank you.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.548
Thank you.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.554
I thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with me, Chief.

17:34.654 --> 17:38.225
I know you've got
a busy schedule.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.494
If you, uh,
have questions,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.896
I'm... happy to answer 'em.

17:43.996 --> 17:47.634
Great. So tell me,
what do you make of the fact

17:47.734 --> 17:50.337
that according to statistics,
the city is safer now

17:50.437 --> 17:51.838
than it was in the '90s?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.141
1990s. I think that's true.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.409
Yet, there's been a significant
increase in violent crime.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.878
And if you're the one
getting robbed

17:58.978 --> 18:00.680
or stabbed
or punched in the head,

18:00.780 --> 18:02.915
statistics mean
absolutely nothing.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.418
So, what does
the police department need

18:05.518 --> 18:07.320
in order to stem the tide?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.356
That's complicated.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.591
Support.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.494
Resources, personnel.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.996
Withholding judgement

18:17.096 --> 18:19.299
until all the facts are in
when there is

18:19.399 --> 18:21.434
a police-involved shooting.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.236
Hey, most cops are good cops.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.772
They come to work wanting
to do good, most cops,

18:25.872 --> 18:27.840
and to be able to go back
to their families

18:27.940 --> 18:30.177
in one piece after their tour.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.782
I would love to see you
make that speech on CNN. No.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.985
That is not likely.
I have a good friend
that does their booking.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.588
Yeah.
You are exactly the kind
of pundit they're looking for.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.855
I'm not a pundit.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.557
Exactly.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.693
Let me ask you a question.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.895
Sure. Ask me anything.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.998
You actually want to see
Raymond Sharpe elected mayor?

18:52.098 --> 18:54.901
Well, if I'm working for him,
I do.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.170
Yeah, just forget all that.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.709
How would he be for the people
who live in the city?

19:03.510 --> 19:06.213
I think he would be effective.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.515
His agenda might not

19:08.615 --> 19:11.718
neatly coincide
with yours or mine, but

19:11.818 --> 19:14.821
I think there'd be
significant areas of overlap.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.991
Overlap.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.061
So what are you looking for
from me?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.131
Well, right now, somebody
who has their ear to the ground.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.167
With the community,
the city council,

19:28.268 --> 19:29.769
executive staff of NYPD.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.338
And who else are you talking to
about that?

19:31.438 --> 19:34.641
Right now, it's just you.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.377

19:46.386 --> 19:47.687
Mr. Emerson.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.390
We're from the 7-4 Precinct.
I'm Detective Morales,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.091
this is Detective Killian. We
want to ask you some questions.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.126
I don't know who shot me
if that's what you're gonna ask.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.829
It was in the vicinity
of Cleveland and Linden

19:56.929 --> 19:58.365
is where you told the EMT
it happened?

19:58.465 --> 19:59.932
Right.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.468
But you didn't see
who might've thrown the shot?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.803
Did not.
If you don't mind my asking,

20:03.903 --> 20:04.871
what were you doing
around there?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.573
Checking out the neighborhood.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.308
Why is that?
Struggling a bit

20:08.408 --> 20:09.509
since I got out of the service.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.043
Rent's being
what they are, needed

20:11.143 --> 20:12.879
to look for a place that
was a little more affordable.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.614
And you were thinking
about East New York?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.483
Couldn't be worse than Fallujah.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.917
Ah.

20:18.017 --> 20:18.951
That was a...
that was a bad one, wasn't it?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.920
What? Did you read about it?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.524
Yeah, I wasn't there.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.792
Nah, you were back here,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.260
strutting around,
blowing the lid off

20:27.360 --> 20:28.495
of street-corner drug dealers

20:28.595 --> 20:29.896
and Joker Poker machines.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.032
Yeah. Nobody was doing
any strutting, Mr. Emerson.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.901
What we're looking to blow
the lid off of is the robbery

20:35.001 --> 20:36.269
of the Easy Wind
Cannabis Dispensary.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.970
You wouldn't happen
to know anything about that?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.639
Not a thing.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.474
You gonna have a story ready
when it turns out

20:41.574 --> 20:43.042
the security guard
from Easy Wind ID's you

20:43.142 --> 20:45.612
as being who he shot
during the course of a robbery?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.246
He ID's me, it'll be because...
Mm-hmm.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.816
...he's got me mixed up
with some other broken down vet

20:49.916 --> 20:51.518
waiting for his benefits
to kick in.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.052
Wouldn't be me.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.354
Yeah.
Broken down.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.488
Yeah.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.657
Thank you.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.467
Did it seem strange
that every time a job came over

21:07.567 --> 21:10.169
the radio for us,
we had backup?
Not particularly.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.439
That fender-bender
on Atlantic Avenue.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.940
Sector Charlie backing up.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.575
The disturbance
in the unemployment office.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.043
Sector Adam backing up.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.713
Cops backing up cops isn't
a strange occurrence, Andre.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.015
That's what cops do.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.617
Somebody went through
what we went through,

21:24.717 --> 21:25.985
I'm sure
we'd be the same thing.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.286
Yeah, I-I just don't want
to be treated

21:27.387 --> 21:31.123
any different than I was
before I got...

21:31.223 --> 21:32.625
you know.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.262
Well, uh, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't worry about it.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.232
Nobody's treating you
all that different.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.637
You prefer, uh,
almond milk or oat milk?

21:55.682 --> 21:57.950
Hey, where's the guy
who was in here?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.786
Haywood said to cut him loose.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
She say why?
I didn't ask her why.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.557
But she wants
to talk to you.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.860
Yeah. I want to
talk to her, too.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.732
Yeah?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
Hey. I'm a little confused, Inspector.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.103
I was just told
that you released an individual

22:17.203 --> 22:18.705
I was holding in the squad room?

22:18.805 --> 22:20.907
What were you holding
him for, Detective?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.275
I like him for one
of the dispensary robberies.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.844
It's a pattern robbery
so if you like him

22:24.944 --> 22:26.779
for one, you like him
for more than one.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.415
Okay, I like him
for more than one.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.182
Based on what?

22:30.282 --> 22:33.386
Based on he loaned a significant
amount of money to Jamal Hayes,

22:33.486 --> 22:36.423
had not been paid back,
had done time for armed robbery.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.824
And is currently employed

22:37.924 --> 22:39.759
as a cook
in your girlfriend's restaurant.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.293
That-That's not why
I-I like him.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.629
I think it is, Detective.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.063
And before
you make a mistake

22:44.163 --> 22:46.566
that has
far greater consequences,

22:46.666 --> 22:48.435
I'm taking you off the case.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.336
I'm having Troy
team up with Morales.

22:50.437 --> 22:53.473
With all due respect, I think
that is totally unwarranted.

22:53.573 --> 22:58.978
You're lucky taking you off
this case is all I'm doing.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.419
Oh. Glad you're keeping Haywood
up-to-date on our cases.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.054
She wanted to know
why we were holding him.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.321
Based on the gunshot wound

23:09.422 --> 23:11.090
and the security guard's
description,

23:11.190 --> 23:12.492
they granted a warrant
to search Emerson's apartment.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.094
Oh. Sounds like
you two make a great team.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.441
Thank you.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.776
Why don't you take the bedroom?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.478
Your friend Killian
ever gonna let up on me?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.412
I don't know.
That's between you two.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.614
It's not like
I'm trying to move in

23:34.714 --> 23:36.449
on whatever it is
he's got going.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.217
Hey, Desmond,
what did I just say?

23:38.317 --> 23:40.453
Yeah, but no doubt he's running
me down to you all the time.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.288
I mean, can you at least
stand up for me a little bit?

23:42.388 --> 23:44.491
What am I, your mother?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.959
Forget I mentioned it.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.665
Guy lives like
he's still active military.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.337
In more ways than one.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.643
That's our friend
Chip Emerson,

24:03.743 --> 24:05.244
and that's the guy Killian
and I interviewed

24:05.344 --> 24:07.614
in the office
of Cannabis Management.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.115
They were soldiers together.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.183
They're still soldiers.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.385
They're just on the other side.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.995
Mr. Hayes?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.731
Hey.
The detectives

24:24.831 --> 24:26.566
that are handling your case
are tied up at the moment.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.768
Okay. Uh, is there
some sort of form

24:28.868 --> 24:30.703
I could fill out, uh,
to get the money back?

24:30.803 --> 24:33.039
Uh, have they
recovered the money?
No, no, no, no. I...

24:33.139 --> 24:35.041
I just want to get my paperwork
in just in case they do.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.309
Okay. You know what?
Let me actually

24:37.409 --> 24:38.745
just go... Uh, hey. Hey.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.580
Hey.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.116
Oh, that's, uh...
that's my daughter Nina.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.119
Oh.
It's nice to meet you, Nina.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.955
Nice to meet you.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.192
You doing a portrait of someone?

24:54.460 --> 24:55.361
Just a sketch.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.696
Ah. Okay.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.031
So, Mr. Hayes wants
to find out about

24:59.131 --> 25:00.867
getting the money back
that was taken from the robbery.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.636
All right, uh, first,
we have to find out

25:03.736 --> 25:05.404
who committed the robbery.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.939
I get it. I was just
trying to figure out

25:07.039 --> 25:08.307
whether or not I'd be able
to keep the dispensary,

25:08.407 --> 25:09.842
or I have to go out

25:09.942 --> 25:11.110
and get another job.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.045
And with my record,

25:13.145 --> 25:15.381
I don't know what kind
of job that's gonna be.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.551
Yeah. Uh, uh, Mr. Hayes,

25:18.651 --> 25:22.454
I-I don't know
what to tell you right now.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.523
Yeah, I know.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.198
I cannot believe what I did
to this guy back in the day.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.033
Sending someone away
for four-and-a-half years

25:34.133 --> 25:35.835
for six ounces of pot?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.270
Yeah, that's tough,
and Elmira, no less.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.706
We're not just sending him.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.241
His daughter grows up
missing her father.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.710
His wife divorces him.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.645
His mother dies
with him upstate. It's insane.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.947
You were a cop
working Narcotics, Regina.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.749
You were doing
what you were told to do.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.784
I know.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.552
Legislature makes laws.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.487
Departmental policy
is to enforce them.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.123
That's the way it works.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.862
I have a really difficult time

26:02.962 --> 26:05.031
letting myself off that easily.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.034
Yeah, well, try getting to know
someone for a couple of years.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.703
You're spending Thanksgiving,
their daughter's quinceañera,

26:10.803 --> 26:14.040
and then putting them
in prison for ten years.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.442
Hey, what do you tell yourself?

26:16.542 --> 26:19.345
Oh. Oh, what do I tell myself?

26:20.813 --> 26:22.348
I tell myself it's my job.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.550
Some days I hate it,
some days I love it.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.119
Most days,
I don't think about it.

26:31.858 --> 26:32.892
Oh, I have to get back.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.194
Come on.
Walk me to the corner.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.799
I got to do something.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.838
You're back.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.774
A couple of things
we didn't cover.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.242
Where's the other guy?
He couldn't make it.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.644
Hmm.
You know someone

26:51.744 --> 26:54.046
named Charles Emerson?
Also goes by Chip?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.482
Why don't we go speak
in my office?
Yeah.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.152
So, you know him?

27:00.252 --> 27:02.354
Yeah, he was in my unit
in the Army.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.956
You talk
to him lately?

27:04.056 --> 27:06.325
What, is... he in trouble?
Why would you think that?

27:06.425 --> 27:07.493
You guys aren't here

27:07.593 --> 27:09.028
just to pass the time of day.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.396
So, what did he do?

27:10.496 --> 27:11.964
We think he may
have been involved

27:12.064 --> 27:14.133
in a robbery
of a cannabis dispensary.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.467
Doesn't surprise me.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.903
Why is that?
We served together.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.605
I was his platoon sergeant,
and, uh,

27:19.706 --> 27:20.940
a while back, he told me

27:21.040 --> 27:22.408
he was going through a bit
of a tough time.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.609
I tried to help.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.944
Help him how?

27:25.044 --> 27:26.578
Just spotted him
a few bucks.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.280
Let him crash on my couch
when he needed to.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.016
Mostly just
talked to him.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.684
He give any indication
he was doing robberies?

27:31.784 --> 27:35.354
No, but, uh, one time
when he was staying over,

27:35.454 --> 27:37.389
he got into my computer.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.825
Probably 'cause
I was real sloppy

27:38.925 --> 27:40.893
at the time
and then left the website open.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.562
We'd like for you to
take a ride back with us

27:43.662 --> 27:46.866
to the precinct,
Mr. Green.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.234
Mr. Green, we have
enough evidence right now

27:48.334 --> 27:49.969
to turn the case against
you over to the D.A.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
And he'll go before the Grand
Jury, and in all likelihood,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.173
get an indictment
against you

27:54.273 --> 27:55.875
for conspiracy
to commit armed robbery.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.544
I was nowhere near the place
when it got robbed.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.479
You didn't need to be.
You provided information

28:00.579 --> 28:02.114
for the commission of the crime.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.850
That's the thing about working
for the government.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.617
They keep track of whatever
you look at on your computer.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.720
But you know that.
We know you picked

28:07.820 --> 28:09.255
which dispensaries
to hit and when.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.223
You're gonna have to give us
something, Mr. Green.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.326
Like what?

28:14.426 --> 28:15.661
What can I give you?

28:15.762 --> 28:17.196
If you want to significantly
reduce the length

28:17.296 --> 28:19.732
of your sentence, you're gonna
have to make it irresistible

28:19.832 --> 28:21.433
for your coconspirators
to pull down another score.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.769
Can you do that?

28:22.869 --> 28:25.738
Look, since this is
all pretty new,

28:25.838 --> 28:27.807
a lot of the dispensaries
that just opened,

28:27.907 --> 28:29.575
they have non-operational
security systems, so...

28:29.675 --> 28:31.343
This your phone?
Yes.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.046
Pick one. I want it hit today.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.357
You know, I don't miss it.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.593
What's that?
Getting high.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.262
That's good.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.698
You know, I thought
when I quit smoking weed

28:52.799 --> 28:54.733
to go on the job that--
I don't know--

28:54.834 --> 28:56.335
like, things wouldn't
be the same.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.138

31:10.836 --> 31:12.104
Okay.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.341

31:20.412 --> 31:22.781

I won't.

I'll get the cash. Okay.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.965
Did you get your hot lunch?
I did.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.435
Get down on the floor now!
Take it easy.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.637
Don't tell me to take it easy.
Do what I tell you

31:45.737 --> 31:48.440
or I'm gonna put one
right in your skull.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.908

Sorry!

31:50.009 --> 31:51.543
Just take whatever you want
to take, man.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.379
Why don't you let me
worry about that?

31:53.479 --> 31:55.847
You got something
else to worry about.
Oh, yeah, what's that?

31:55.948 --> 31:58.350
Look down.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.087
NYPD!

32:01.187 --> 32:02.921
You're surrounded, son.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.623
Drop the gun.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.792
Now!

32:07.926 --> 32:09.128
Give me your hand.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.629
Yeah.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.810
Yeah?

32:24.910 --> 32:26.845
I'm not trying to reinstate
myself or anything, boss.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.614
I just happened to be
there when we got word

32:28.714 --> 32:31.417
you wanted to see him so
I brought him downstairs.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.752
Oh, yeah.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.556
Here you go.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.860
It's all right, Detective.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.064
As far as I'm concerned, you've
been chastised sufficiently.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.099
So long as the gentleman
you placed in the holding cell

32:47.199 --> 32:49.268
yesterday doesn't file
a civil complaint,

32:49.368 --> 32:51.970
I'll consider the matter closed.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.106
Okay?

32:54.206 --> 32:56.042
Okay.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.181
Two of your crew

33:02.281 --> 33:03.482
were caught red-handed.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.351
Your testimony,
in all likelihood,

33:05.451 --> 33:07.353
will get
the third one convicted.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.388
You could conceivably

33:09.488 --> 33:10.889
reduce the length
of your sentence further.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.424
You don't have
to spend it at someplace

33:12.524 --> 33:13.992
like Elmira, you don't...

33:14.993 --> 33:16.328
How?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.397
Your crew took a dispensary

33:18.497 --> 33:20.132
for $85,000 yesterday.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.733
I want that money back.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.637
I never would've taken you
for a shakedown artist.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.006
The money belongs to the man
you stole it from.

33:28.107 --> 33:32.111
Make it easy for the both of us,
and tell me where it is.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.486
Under the rug in my bedroom
there's a, a floor safe.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.247
Hey.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.782
Do you want a menu
or you know what you want?

34:11.583 --> 34:12.551
Is he here?

34:12.651 --> 34:15.554
George?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.759
Hey.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.729
Let me know
if I should call a lawyer.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.702
I jump to conclusions.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.772
All right, it's not
an unusual trait among cops.

34:33.872 --> 34:36.542
Take what I know about
your life, which isn't a lot,

34:36.642 --> 34:38.777
and then I judge you
based on what I know.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.912
That and the fact that you work
for my girlfriend,

34:41.012 --> 34:43.649
as I hope you understand,
her wellbeing is

34:43.749 --> 34:45.584
the most important thing
in the world to me.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.186
I do understand that.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.455
So then I...

34:49.555 --> 34:51.790
take what I know,
and I act on it.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.693
Sometimes I'm right.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.062
In your case, I was wrong.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.399
I should've treated you
respectfully, but, um...

35:00.499 --> 35:02.634
I-I was wrong.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.036
I'm sorry
I put you through that.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.607
I, uh...

35:08.707 --> 35:11.109
I've never had a cop
apologize to me before.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.846
You're a citizen now, George.
You deserve an apology.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.662
So I, um, I apologized to him.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.431
Well, I guess that covers it.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.866
Hey, the guy, he did time
for armed robbery, Corinne.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.435
I mean, what am
I supposed to do,

35:36.535 --> 35:38.570
think of him
as being above suspicion?

35:38.670 --> 35:39.705
This isn't about him.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.173
It's about you.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.874
The only reason you have

35:42.974 --> 35:44.843
for dragging him out of here
is that you wanted to be right.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.213
So you just use your authority

35:47.313 --> 35:49.581
and your little gold
shield and you made everybody

35:49.681 --> 35:51.183
that works in that kitchen
with George

35:51.283 --> 35:54.119
and George's sister and
George's wife scared to death

35:54.220 --> 35:56.455
you were gonna find a reason
to send him back to prison.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.689
Yeah, but I didn't.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.491
You're a bully, Tommy.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.660
I don't want to be
with you anymore.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.826
You got a minute?
Sure.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.896
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i> Come in.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.468
When I was in Narcotics,
we did a lot

36:42.568 --> 36:44.736
of buy-and-busts
in South Jamaica.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.238
I know it well.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.240
Even though we targeted heroin
and crack cocaine,

36:48.340 --> 36:50.742
if you were selling marijuana,
we grabbed you up, too.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.177
Who are you trying
to get out of prison?

36:52.278 --> 36:54.380
His name's Jamal Hayes
and he's already out.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.315
Because anyone
who did time

36:56.415 --> 36:58.984
for marijuana is given
priority in the awarding

36:59.084 --> 37:01.287
of marijuana dispensary licenses,

37:01.387 --> 37:04.155
Jamal borrowed money,
he set himself up in business,

37:04.256 --> 37:07.192
and he was on his way to making
a halfway decent living.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.727
When what happened?

37:08.827 --> 37:09.861
He was robbed.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.230
His inventory was wiped out.

37:12.331 --> 37:15.501
His cash was wiped out
to the tune of $85,000.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.903
What do you want to do for him?

37:18.937 --> 37:21.707
I got one of the perps
to give up the money.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.976
And you want
to return it to Jamal.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.679
Okay.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.715
I just wanted to see

37:29.815 --> 37:32.183
if you'd back me up first.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.260
I will absolutely back you up.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.397
Thank you, Chief.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.740
Hi.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.242
How long have you been
waiting out there?

37:57.343 --> 37:59.044
Uh, not long.
I just wanted to catch you

37:59.144 --> 38:00.579
before you left for the day.

38:00.679 --> 38:01.713
I guess you want an answer.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.281
I kind of need one.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.992
If what you're looking for
from me is information,

38:14.092 --> 38:15.727
with certain limitations,

38:15.827 --> 38:17.329
I'm willing
to provide it.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.831
I mean, it makes so much sense
if somebody's running for mayor

38:19.931 --> 38:21.800
they'd want to be...

38:21.900 --> 38:23.402
as informed as possible.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.070
What kind of limitations?

38:25.170 --> 38:27.205
If it compromises
an ongoing investigation

38:27.305 --> 38:29.841
or, if in my judgement,
for whatever reason,

38:29.941 --> 38:31.577
it shouldn't be shared,
then it won't be.

38:31.677 --> 38:32.811
I don't think I can sell that.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.680
And I assume that if you can't,

38:34.780 --> 38:36.448
uh, I won't be asked
a second time.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.916
That's the way it usually works.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.685
And whomever imposes
no limitations

38:39.785 --> 38:41.420
and no conditions,

38:41.520 --> 38:43.622
they'll be
our next police commissioner.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.890
They'll want it
more than you do.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.592
No doubt
there's another candidate.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.728
There always is.

38:53.365 --> 38:57.202
Tell Raymond there are things
that I'll do.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.471
There are things
that I won't do.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.974
And I will live
with whatever he decides.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.479
Okay.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.358
Here it is, Jamal.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.129
85 grand.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.140
Oh, my God.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.308
You didn't deserve
to go to prison

39:37.409 --> 39:40.045
and you didn't deserve
to get robbed.

39:40.145 --> 39:43.048
I didn't expect someone
to make it right though.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.885
Whatever we can make right,
we should.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.221
I'm gonna have
an officer

39:50.321 --> 39:52.223
escort you to the bank,
'cause I wouldn't want

39:52.323 --> 39:54.092
to see you get robbed
a second time.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.327
No, we don't want that.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.864
No.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.001
Take care.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.370
Thank you, Inspector.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.338
Yeah.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.174
All right.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.408
Thanks.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.179
What's the story
with those boots?

40:14.279 --> 40:16.715
Those are Vonny Briggs's boots.
That was his locker.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.518
How'd he die?
He got out of his RMP

40:19.618 --> 40:21.853
on the Belt Parkway to assist

40:21.953 --> 40:23.822
another driver
who had broken down.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.891
Got run over by another driver.

40:30.829 --> 40:34.199
I stayed out of the shop a lot
longer than I had to, Marvin.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.068
When was that?

40:37.168 --> 40:38.537
Today at that dispensary.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.306
I went out to the car
to get my phone

40:41.406 --> 40:44.142
and I stayed out there hoping
that whatever happened...

40:44.242 --> 40:46.444
inside happened
while I was out there.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.047
That if anybody
had to get shot,

40:49.147 --> 40:51.316
it wouldn't be me.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.451
You knew ESU was on the scene.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.395
But you didn't stay out there, right?

41:04.496 --> 41:06.331
No, sir.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.469
That's what matters.

41:31.757 --> 41:34.225
That was sweet what you said

41:34.325 --> 41:36.027
to me this morning.
Oh, yeah?

41:36.127 --> 41:38.063
What did I say?

41:38.163 --> 41:39.965
Well, you told me
what it was like doing your job

41:40.065 --> 41:43.468
and it made it a little easier
for me doing mine.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.270
Well...
