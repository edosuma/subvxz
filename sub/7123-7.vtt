01:19.345 --> 01:20.710
Hmm.

01:20.780 --> 01:21.780
Mm-hmm.

01:23.049 --> 01:23.879
Thanks.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.076
Sign my rock!

01:25.151 --> 01:26.151
Okay.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.884
Finn!

01:27.954 --> 01:29.080
U-uh, uh, uhh...

01:29.155 --> 01:30.155
Have dinner with me!

01:30.190 --> 01:31.020
Please!

01:31.091 --> 01:32.285
Please! Please!

01:32.358 --> 01:33.791
Please! Finn!

01:33.860 --> 01:34.758
Sure, man. Yeah. Sure.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.988
Sometime.

01:37.964 --> 01:38.964
How about...

01:38.998 --> 01:41.330
e-every night this week?!

01:41.401 --> 01:42.993
Well... maybe <i>one</i> night.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.269
Come on, man! <i>Every</i> night!

01:47.340 --> 01:48.932
No, man. You get out of here.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.532
Boom!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.009
Hey, y'all! Don't fight!

01:54.547 --> 01:55.658
We should get out of here, Finn.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.926
I think somebody
called the heat.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.941
Weee-oooh!

01:59.018 --> 02:00.280
Weee-oooh!

02:00.353 --> 02:01.980
Weee-oooh!

02:11.764 --> 02:13.493
Have dinner with me!

02:13.566 --> 02:14.658
Have dinner!

02:14.734 --> 02:16.429
I want you to have dinner!

02:16.503 --> 02:17.561
Finn!

02:17.637 --> 02:19.161
Sucks.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.470
Finn, can go outside today?

02:24.544 --> 02:26.171
Well... I guess I could.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.286
I just don't want to deal
with those guys right now.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.815
Ohhhhh!

02:29.883 --> 02:31.214
Deal with <i>me!</i>

02:33.586 --> 02:37.955
Let's play "Cops and Robbers"!

02:38.024 --> 02:39.651
Gimme your bank account!

02:39.726 --> 02:40.726
Bang, bang!

02:42.562 --> 02:43.392
Huh?

02:43.463 --> 02:44.589
Reach for the roof!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.461
And give me all your goldbricks!

02:46.533 --> 02:47.693
Uh, okay, okay.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.767
Don't hurt me!

02:48.835 --> 02:49.893
Don't worry, Finn.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.664
It's only me... BMO.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.729
I'm wearing a disguise!

02:56.075 --> 02:57.075
Hmm.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.239
Your beauty is destroyed!

03:13.960 --> 03:14.790
Hotcha!

03:14.861 --> 03:16.192
BMO, how do I look?

03:16.262 --> 03:18.230
Like the devil!

03:19.399 --> 03:20.991
Whoa!

03:21.067 --> 03:22.125
Intruder!

03:22.202 --> 03:23.032
Finn!

03:23.102 --> 03:24.569
There's an intruder in here!

03:24.637 --> 03:26.502
No, it's me... it's Finn.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.666
This is my alter-ego...

03:28.741 --> 03:29.833
Davey Johnson.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.467
Ohhhhhhhh.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.808
I'll dress up like this so
nobody bothers me about

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
being Finn.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.905
Do you think that'll
going to do the trick?

03:36.983 --> 03:38.280
I dunno.

03:39.986 --> 03:40.816
Huh?

03:40.887 --> 03:41.717
Huh?

03:41.788 --> 03:42.618
Is that?

03:42.689 --> 03:43.519
Is that Finn?!

03:43.590 --> 03:44.818
Hello... um...

03:44.891 --> 03:46.791
Hello, hello, hello,
hello, hello.

03:46.859 --> 03:47.689
He-llo.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.784
Uhhhhhhhhh...

03:52.198 --> 03:53.096
Hello.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.258
I'm Davey.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.232
Oh.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.131
Thought it was Finn,

03:56.202 --> 03:58.261
on account he's wearing
Finn's exact clothes.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.464
Oh, man.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.638
Ha ha!

04:05.511 --> 04:06.705
Hi. I'm Davey.

04:06.779 --> 04:07.837
Ah, so what?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.091
You want to have dinner with me?

04:09.115 --> 04:10.173
Go away, weirdo.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.581
Ha ha.

04:14.250 --> 04:22.250
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

04:40.713 --> 04:41.543
Hey!

04:41.614 --> 04:42.444
Come on!

04:42.515 --> 04:43.715
You got to pay for those, man!

04:43.750 --> 04:45.513
I'm trying to run
a business here!

04:49.989 --> 04:51.786
I got to find a job.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.488
I need a job.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.657
Can you sweep a broom?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.530
You betcha!

05:11.444 --> 05:13.241
Geez Louise! Quitting
time already?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.974
Sure is, Davey.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.039
Take 'er easy, boss.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.947
Good night, Davey.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.215
Man, today was awesome...

05:23.289 --> 05:24.347
Just normal, you know?

05:24.424 --> 05:25.618
Just like a normal day.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.956
No drama or anything of that...
just super-normal.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.119
Man, it was great.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.287
That's cool.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.591
Good night, Finn.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.394
I'm Davey.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.630
Yeah.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.864
I'm Davey.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.220
Hey, Finn, you want
to have dinner

05:45.244 --> 05:47.007
instead of breakfast today?

05:48.147 --> 05:49.205
Finn?

05:50.583 --> 05:51.811
That <i>must</i> be him.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.377
I made you dinner, Finn!

05:55.455 --> 05:56.649
Where were you?!

05:56.723 --> 05:57.985
Whoa!

06:02.328 --> 06:04.057
Uh, what's going on?

06:04.130 --> 06:05.324
Oh, hiya, mister.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.922
Thanks for putting
me up last night.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.227
I'm just chopping some wood

06:08.301 --> 06:10.394
so's I can build a little
log cabin to live in.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.836
Huhhhhhh?!

06:15.641 --> 06:17.040
Hey. I'm Randy.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.668
Randy, want to get
dinner tonight?

06:18.745 --> 06:20.144
Nah. I'm busy.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.078
I like to wander at night.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.706
Finn, what's going on?

06:26.519 --> 06:28.419
You got to start calling
me "Davey," Mister...

06:28.488 --> 06:30.217
because that's my name.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.649
Da-a-a-a-a-vey.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.557
Aw, no!

06:35.628 --> 06:37.289
Have you lost your teacups, man?

06:37.363 --> 06:38.923
Mister, I don't know
nothing about that.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.659
I'm just a working Joe,

06:40.733 --> 06:42.223
trying to stake my claim

06:42.301 --> 06:43.825
under the sun

06:43.903 --> 06:49.398
and look out on the beautiful
green fields... called... life!

06:49.475 --> 06:50.737
Uhhhhh...

06:50.810 --> 06:52.835
Hey, Davey, where do
you want these logs?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.641
Oh, just attach
them to the cabin,

06:54.714 --> 06:55.714
like how it should be...

06:55.748 --> 06:56.908
so it looks like a cabin.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.349
We're gonna build a right
wall and a front wall.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.512
Uh... how about the roof?

07:01.587 --> 07:03.179
Maybe. Maybe.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.689
I've been holding these.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.849
They look good.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.853
Got to figure a way to
get Finn to act normal.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.022
Pyoo! Pyoo! Pyoo-pyoo!

07:12.098 --> 07:13.998
Pyoo-pyoo-pyoo-pyoo-pyoo-pyoo!

07:20.807 --> 07:21.933
Aaaaah!

07:22.008 --> 07:23.305
Gimme the wallet!

07:23.376 --> 07:24.968
Or feel my claw!

07:25.044 --> 07:26.102
The wallet!

07:26.179 --> 07:28.739
Watch out! A robber!

07:28.815 --> 07:30.077
I'll cut you!

07:30.149 --> 07:31.343
I mean, rob you!

07:31.417 --> 07:32.247
Oh, no!

07:32.318 --> 07:33.148
I'm a robber!

07:33.219 --> 07:34.550
I'm gonna rob this guy's life!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.110
And there's nobody
who can stop me!

07:36.189 --> 07:38.783
Unless... there's a
hero around here.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.554
Like, if someone around here was
actually a <i>hero</i> in <i>disguise,</i>

07:43.629 --> 07:45.824
they could probably stop me.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.630
Come on, Finn! Be a hero!

07:49.702 --> 07:50.794
What?

07:50.870 --> 07:51.996
What are we talking about?

07:52.071 --> 07:53.402
Butt out, Randy!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.100
Ohhhhhhh!

07:55.174 --> 07:56.539
Yes, Finn!

07:56.609 --> 07:58.440
Put on your awesome
hat and beat me up!

07:58.511 --> 07:59.375
What?

07:59.445 --> 08:02.312
I'm not talking to you, Randy!

08:02.381 --> 08:03.780
I called the police.

08:03.850 --> 08:04.942
Hmm.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.211
Wait... what?!

08:06.285 --> 08:08.310
Weee-oooh! Weee-oooh!

08:08.387 --> 08:09.820
Guys, it's not what
it looks like!

08:09.889 --> 08:11.413
That guy isn't
really named Davey!

08:11.491 --> 08:12.515
It's Finn!

08:12.592 --> 08:14.321
He brainwashed himself
to become Davey,

08:14.393 --> 08:16.224
and I was just trying
to inspire him

08:16.295 --> 08:17.660
to go back to being Finn!

08:17.730 --> 08:19.163
Yeah, yeah!

08:19.232 --> 08:20.460
We've heard that before!

08:20.533 --> 08:21.693
Come along... Robber!

08:21.767 --> 08:22.767
R-robber.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.531
Finn! Don't let the
dragon drag on, man!

08:25.605 --> 08:28.768
Don't let the dragon drag on!!

08:28.841 --> 08:30.365
Don't let the dragon...

08:30.443 --> 08:31.774
Jake?

08:35.313 --> 08:37.679
Well, that was pretty
unusual, wasn't it, Davey?

08:39.150 --> 08:40.379
Get outta here, Randy!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.943
Get o-o-o-o-out!

08:49.095 --> 08:50.426
No more Davey.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.929
But you love being Davey.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.329
I <i>do</i> love being Davey,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.629
but being Davey caused
Jake to get arrested.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.134
But remember that time

08:57.203 --> 09:01.230
when Davey sat in the park and
saw some people walking around?

09:01.307 --> 09:02.365
Yeah.

09:02.441 --> 09:03.635
That was nice.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.269
And remember that time when
Davey swept the floors?

09:07.513 --> 09:08.912
Yeah, that was great, too.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.005
But...

09:10.082 --> 09:13.745
Do you <i>really</i> want to go
back to being a famous hero?

09:13.819 --> 09:15.343
Why not just be Davey...

09:15.421 --> 09:19.653
A simple man with simple
goals and simple problems?

09:19.725 --> 09:22.785
You can just blend in and
live the simple life.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.490
Yeah... blend in.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.033
You know, maybe I'll be Davey...

09:28.100 --> 09:30.933
just one more time.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.836
One more time.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.770
Come on, man!

09:34.840 --> 09:36.398
That last game wasn't fair!

09:36.475 --> 09:38.966
How about who can hold up
their hand the longest?

09:39.045 --> 09:40.273
Okay.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.574
This game breaks the tie.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.647
Okay.

09:42.682 --> 09:43.682
Last game.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.081
Last game.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.753
Hey, fellas. How's tricks?

09:51.824 --> 09:54.088
Hmm? Oh. Hey, Davey.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.822
Keys.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.629
Hmm?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.224
W-w-what's going on?

10:02.301 --> 10:03.301
Oh. Uh...

10:04.170 --> 10:05.102
Would you care for a...

10:05.171 --> 10:06.001
body sweep?

10:06.072 --> 10:07.972
Um... yeah. Sure.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.234
I do feel kinda dirty.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.835
Whoo!

10:12.912 --> 10:14.504
You sure know how
to party, Davey!

10:16.515 --> 10:17.573
Yes, yes!

10:17.650 --> 10:19.345
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!

10:19.418 --> 10:21.579
No! No, no! No!

10:26.025 --> 10:26.923
Davey?!

10:26.993 --> 10:29.427
No, it's me... Finn!

10:29.495 --> 10:30.519
Finn!

10:31.931 --> 10:33.592
Here's your mail, criminal.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.429
We feed <i>our</i> criminals.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.731
Hey! Stop!
