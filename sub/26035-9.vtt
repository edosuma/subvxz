WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:04.138
* Fly, Eagles, fly... *

00:04.172 --> 00:05.473
CHARLIE:
Where is it? It was right here.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.341
I cannot find it.
And by the way, Mac,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.009
what are you even talking
about? The word is

00:09.043 --> 00:10.878
"superstition,"
not "stupidstition."

00:10.911 --> 00:12.913
I know what the word is,
Charlie.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.817
I'm saying your Green Man suit
is a stupid superstition.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.520
Oh, really? Then why do
the Eagles keep winning?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.822
Also, by the way, dude, uh,
you're a Cowboys fan,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.358
-so shut the hell up.
-I'm not a Cowboy fan,
I'm a Tony Romo fan,

00:24.392 --> 00:27.195
-and he retired, so now I bleed
green. Go, Birds, go, Birds!
-All right, well,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.029
I'm not going to the Super Bowl
without it. I got to find it.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.831
Yeah, don't make us late,
Charlie, all right?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.866
I-If you can't find it,
you can't find it, you know?

00:32.900 --> 00:35.103
The-the fans have no effect on
the outcome of the game, anyway.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.937
-Do you know how football works?
-MAC: Yes, that's right,

00:36.970 --> 00:39.607
your voodoo bullshit is not
gonna mean anything at the--

00:39.640 --> 00:41.242
what? What's going on
with your eye?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.111
Uh, nothing, I got a-- I think
I got an eyelash in it.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.045
You're, like, scratching it
and it's blinking...

00:45.079 --> 00:46.580
I just, I slept on it funny.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.216
What the hell
is the holdup here?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.750
MAC:
Frank, this is why I wanted

00:49.783 --> 00:51.919
total control over
the guest list, all right?

00:51.952 --> 00:54.555
The eyes of the world
are gonna be on Philadelphia.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.058
And I want to show them that we
are not just degenerates, okay?

00:58.092 --> 01:01.295
And that is why I'm very nervous
about these guys.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.364
(chanting):
Yeah! Chug, chug, chug!

01:03.397 --> 01:04.765
Chug, chug, chug!

01:04.798 --> 01:06.066
-Chug, chug, chug!
-Hey!

01:06.100 --> 01:07.235
Chug-- boom!

01:07.268 --> 01:09.537
-(laughs)
-That's 15.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.038
Post that, Jack, post it, baby.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.573
I can't-- it doesn't work
with this, uh...

01:12.606 --> 01:14.275
(laughter)

01:14.308 --> 01:15.543
-Oh!
-MAC: Oh, come on.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.111
No big, giant, ridiculous hands.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.947
What? What? D-Don't make me
go without them.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.449
I'm not making you go at all.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.950
Frank, these people
are the worst.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.419
Come on, Mac.
This is the salt of the earth.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.621
These people represent
Philadelphia. That's right.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.390
-Yeah.
-You have literally picked out

01:29.423 --> 01:31.959
the biggest pieces of shit
in the city.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.495
I got to agree with that.
These guys are pieces of shit.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.597
-What is in your mouth?
-Chew.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.832
-Awesome, cool, good to see you.
-Oh, my God.

01:38.866 --> 01:39.900
-Cricket.
-Yeah, baby?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.101
Bad news, you're out.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.636
-What? Wait, why?
-Well, you are literally

01:42.670 --> 01:45.273
the worst representation
of the entire city.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.641
-Oh...
-Your nose is bleeding
as we speak.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.343
Okay, I came up portside
on a horse, and he was

01:49.377 --> 01:50.844
a little quicker than me--
that's lesson learned.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.313
You can't bump Crick.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.947
-I can, I have, and I will.
-Oh, God.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.184
I have an alternate.
Here he comes.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.018
-Hey, guys!
-Oh, hey!
-(laughter)

01:58.051 --> 02:00.120
-Pumped for the big game?
-Yeah, baby.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.122
Yes. Now, see,
Rex represents the best

02:02.156 --> 02:03.791
-that Philadelphia has to offer.
-Oh, yeah.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.026
Either way, Cricks, you're out.
Get out of here.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.695
-Unbelievable. I mean...
-All right, Crick, all right.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.697
-You're the worst.
-We got to go, we got to go.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.766
Yo, check it out.
I got one last surprise.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.635
("Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor
playing)

02:14.668 --> 02:17.871
(cheering, whooping)

02:17.905 --> 02:20.808
FRANK:
Here you go, here you go.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.009
-Is this a bar?
-Nice.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.212
-Nice.
-Fully stocked, baby.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.646
(overlapping chatter)

02:25.679 --> 02:27.515
(cheering)

02:27.548 --> 02:29.483
-You found it!
-MAC: All right.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.485
You found the damn suit--
can we go now?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.153
-(whoops)
-E! A! G!

02:33.187 --> 02:36.056
L! E! S! Eagles!

02:36.089 --> 02:38.125
* It's the eye of the tiger *

02:38.158 --> 02:40.228
* It's the thrill of the fight *

02:40.261 --> 02:44.332
* Rising up to the challenge
of our rival *

02:44.365 --> 02:47.167
* And the last known survivor *

02:47.201 --> 02:49.637
* Stalks his prey in the night *

02:49.670 --> 02:52.906
* And he's watching us all
with the eye *

02:52.940 --> 02:55.209
* Of the tiger. *

03:00.614 --> 03:03.684
* The eye of the tiger... *

03:03.717 --> 03:05.118
Yeah.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.658
Wait for it.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.159
-(grunting rhythmically)
-Oh, my God.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.161
No, no, no.
We're gonna sing it again?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.529
This is, like, the tenth time.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.065
Oh, yeah, i-it turns out
there's not that many songs

03:18.098 --> 03:19.400
about Philadelphia.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.401
-(music fades)
-Aw, man...

03:20.434 --> 03:21.569
(overlapping chatter)

03:21.602 --> 03:23.070
REX:
Uh, Charlie.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.373
-What happened to your nose?
-CRICKET: Uh...

03:25.406 --> 03:26.540
You're bleeding, man.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.742
Uh, um. Oh, all right.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.943
-All right, fine, it's me.
-DEE: Oh!

03:29.977 --> 03:31.512
-Cricket.
-Cricket!

03:31.545 --> 03:33.914
Yes, it's me, it's me.
I snuck on, all right?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.183
-Ah, this damn nose.
-Ooh, ooh, ooh. We should, uh,

03:36.216 --> 03:40.354
uh, we should probably go
back for Charlie, right? But...

03:40.388 --> 03:43.891
Ah, I don't want to set
a precedent of little mishaps

03:43.924 --> 03:46.894
setting us back, so...

03:46.927 --> 03:48.796
Cricket, you're back in.
We're going to the Super Bowl.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.599
-Yeah, all right.
-(slurring): Hey, Mac, uh,

03:51.632 --> 03:54.402
what about the waitress?
She's gonna want to turn around.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.104
-Sh-She don't
even like football.
-Oh, yeah, football sucks.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.206
But if Charlie missed the bus,
he missed the bus.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.476
I'm not missing a second
of my dreamboat, Tommy Terrific!

04:02.510 --> 04:03.911
-Go, Pats! Go, Pats! Go, Pats!
-(all yelling)

04:03.944 --> 04:05.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drive! Drive!

04:05.446 --> 04:06.880
Go, Pats! Go, Pats!
Oh, shit, pothole.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.650
-(metal clattering)
-(all yelling)

04:09.683 --> 04:13.287
Oh, something kicked loose
inside. (groans)

04:13.321 --> 04:15.289
-Oh, that was bad. That was bad.
-Oh, yeah.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.124
You're not looking
so good, Frank.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.559
-Yeah.
-You want a protein shake?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.127
-No. No.
-Brought a couple cases

04:20.160 --> 04:21.995
of my new Invigaron berries
to hock at the game.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.497
MAC:
Invigaron?

04:23.531 --> 04:24.965
You're involved
in that pyramid scheme, too?

04:24.998 --> 04:27.601
No. No hocking berries
at the Super Bowl, Rex.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.936
Just be meat, okay?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.738
Well-- take off
your shirt, please.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.507
-It's so cold, Mac.
-(groans)

04:33.541 --> 04:35.476
-And you. What's going on
with you?
-No, no, no. I'm fine.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.679
Just a little intestinal
cramping. I'll be fine.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.415
-Come on, let's rent a car
and ditch these dodos, okay?
-Oh, Jesus.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.284
W-What's wrong with your eye?
It's, like, way worse.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.119
Okay, I get it, I get it.

04:46.153 --> 04:49.256
It's "Pick on Dee for No Reason
Day." Real original.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.760
(grunts)
Uh, okay.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.296
Oh, man,
I got grease on my jean shorts.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.866
All right, well, uh, all right,
there's good news and bad news.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.668
The bad news is,
the axle's bent,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.536
-and this bus
isn't going anywhere.
-(groans)

05:02.570 --> 05:04.672
But the good news is
is we passed a Walmart

05:04.705 --> 05:06.106
a few miles back.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
So you can go get some parts.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.443
Oh, no, no, no.
They don't have axles there.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.879
But I can get
a new pair of jean shorts.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.882
Damn it, Frank.
I knew this would happen.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.150
We invite the wrong crowd,
and now we've got people

05:17.184 --> 05:19.152
going on expeditions
for jean shorts.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.155
And hocking magical berries
and rooting for the Patriots?

05:22.189 --> 05:23.457
This always happens to us.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.493
Every single thing we do
turns to shit.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.896
And now, we finally have
an opportunity to be something,

05:28.929 --> 05:31.399
to be winners,
and we're not gonna make it.

05:31.432 --> 05:35.135
We are never, ever gonna
make it to the Super Bowl.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.671
Well...

05:37.705 --> 05:42.710
(chanting):
E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!

05:42.743 --> 05:45.479
ANNOUNCER: Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Super Bowl LII.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.315
Well, we made it to
the Super Bowl. That was easy.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.083
Yeah, it was incredibly smooth.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.852
All right, guys,
let's go out into the stadium,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.353
see what we can
get ourselves into.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.088
-(cheering)
-MAC: Guys, guys.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.090
Let's just stay in the box,
all right?

05:57.124 --> 05:59.493
You know, for the whole game,
everybody just stays in the box.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.563
(booing, jeering)

06:02.596 --> 06:04.598
Let's-let's cool it
on the boos, you know?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.067
That's-that's kind of, like,
what we're famous for, you know?

06:07.100 --> 06:11.004
We-we boo ourselves, we boo
the Eagles, we boo Santa Claus.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.607
Let's save our boos,
for the team that deserves it.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.776
And that's the most
successful franchise

06:15.809 --> 06:17.210
in the history
of organized sports.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.579
Okay. Let's just be
the most respectful

06:18.612 --> 06:20.280
Philly fans we can be.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.516
Mac's right. Everybody,
just act like you belong.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.518
(booing, jeering)

06:24.552 --> 06:27.220
-What? What?
-That's okay to boo.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.723
Yeah, Dee, your eye
does not look good.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.225
Okay, "Everybody look at me,
I'm a stupid Pats fan,

06:32.259 --> 06:34.227
making up stuff
about Dee's eye."

06:34.261 --> 06:36.697
Dee, you definitely
have pink eye.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.699
I-I don't have pink...
all right.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.702
Would a person
with pink eye do this?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.537
-(gasping, booing)
-Would she do that?

06:43.571 --> 06:45.238
-Boo.
-What?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.974
-Guys, the game's gonna start.
Kickoff, kickoff.
-Oh!

06:47.007 --> 06:48.776
-Kickoff, kickoff.
-(cheering)

06:48.809 --> 06:51.044
Guys, stay positive.
Stay positive.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.047
ANNOUNCER: Gostkowski
approaches the football,

06:54.081 --> 06:57.651
and Super Bowl LII is underway.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.755
Oh, I like this drive, boys.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.256
-(groans)
-I like this drive.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.258
Birds look good.
Birds look good.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.127
Frank, what's going on, man?

07:07.160 --> 07:08.929
-Huh?
-What's wrong with you?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.498
I just got to go
to the bathroom.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.432
We can go?
Let's take a, take a walk.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.602
Well, h-hold on one second.
They're-- Eagles are driving.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.804
-Let's just wait till there's
a break in the action.
-I got to pee.

07:16.837 --> 07:20.107
Hello. Someone has been pushing
the call button. Nonstop.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.944
Oh, that's me. Yeah, I-I choked
down some dogs too fast.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.179
They-they didn't settle,
you know?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.748
They came back up, actually.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.617
On the other dogs.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.351
Yeah, we're gonna need
some reinforcements there, pal.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.655
Can we get some binoculars
up in here, too?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.456
Oh, my God.
(laughs softly)

07:36.490 --> 07:38.091
How did I move
all the way to Minnesota,

07:38.125 --> 07:39.527
and I'm still waiting
on you people?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.261
-Huh?
-What are you talking about?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.631
-I've waited on you.
-I-I don't know this guy.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.965
-No, you never waited on us.
-Uh-uh.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.199
-We don't live
in Minnesota, bud.
-Yeah.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.801
I have waited on you back in--

07:47.835 --> 07:49.537
uh, you know what?
It's not worth recapping.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.171
W-What's the point?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.606
Hey, man.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.374
You seem
a little stressed-- ooh.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.610
You're kind of frail.
You need to get swole.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.612
What if I told you
there's a berry

07:58.646 --> 08:00.280
that can handle
all your fitness needs?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.282
I'm good, but thank you.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.884
I'm just gonna go do my job.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.053
(grunts)

08:06.086 --> 08:08.789
-Oh!
-(laughter)

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
(laughter, booing)

08:12.225 --> 08:14.795
I tied his shoelaces together.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.329
(laughter)

08:16.363 --> 08:17.798
This Minnesota rube,
he's not ready

08:17.831 --> 08:20.000
for your big-city
shenanigans, Frank.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.236
Waiter, run and go
get us some beer, would you?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.238
-ANNOUNCER:
And the kick is good.
-(cheering)

08:25.272 --> 08:28.041
And the Eagles
lead Super Bowl LII...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.678
I got to pee now.
I got to pee now.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.512
-Yeah, let's go now.
-All right. There's a break
in the action.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.047
-Frank, we got to come back
fast. Come back fast.
-I got to go.

08:37.751 --> 08:41.354
FRANK:
Oh! God! Damn it!

08:41.388 --> 08:43.523
What's going on
over there, Frank?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.926
I got a kidney stone.
(growls)

08:45.959 --> 08:48.361
Oh. O-On the bus.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.363
I felt a little piece
of kidney stone break off

08:50.397 --> 08:52.532
and go through the,
into the bladder.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.768
Why didn't you tell me that
you have a kidney stone, dude?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.169
I don't want to freak you out.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.038
Well, you're freaking me out
now, man.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.040
-(crowd cheering)
-Oh, shit, we're missing
something.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.510
Listen, Frank. This kidney stone
better not screw us up.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.112
(scoffs)
I can manage.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.915
This ain't my first rodeo.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.183
ANNOUNCER: The P.A.T.
is no good. He missed it.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.551
-(jeering)
-Yes!

09:11.585 --> 09:13.553
(moans)

09:13.587 --> 09:16.590
We don't see the touchdown and
then they miss the extra point?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.425
Dee, how'd the Eagles score?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.694
Who knows? I can't see
a goddamn thing this high up.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.262
These seats are the worst.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.731
You can't see because you have

09:23.764 --> 09:26.767
a very serious bacterial
infection in your eye.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.102
-Hey, you got new hands.
-Oh, yeah.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.203
Oh, I like them.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.705
-(chuckles)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.306
Where do you think you're going?

09:33.340 --> 09:34.574
Oh, ding-dong here's
getting honored

09:34.608 --> 09:35.743
with the rest of the vets.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.310
I'm gonna sneak down there
with him.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.212
When we get close to the field,
I'm gonna let you in

09:39.246 --> 09:41.248
on a little plan
I've whipped up.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.416
No, no plans, all right?
Just stay in the box.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.218
Guess what? No one's talking
to you, okay?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.720
All right, when we get close
to the field...

09:46.754 --> 09:49.790
Whoa. Dee. Both your eyes are
looking real bad.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.793
MAC: Oh, yeah,
that pink eye's disgusting.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.094
So, you know what,
you can go, but I'm,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.562
I'm just gonna cover you up

09:55.595 --> 09:57.597
so people don't know that
you're from Philadelphia.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.566
Go. Go. Go.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.235
Mac, come on.
What're we doing up here, huh?

10:02.269 --> 10:05.806
L-Luxury suite?
Napkins? Utensils?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.809
We're going soft up here
in this ivory tower.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.477
I mean, if they get to go,
we should, too.

10:10.510 --> 10:14.581
Come on, let us loose, Mac.
Unleash the fury!

10:14.614 --> 10:15.783
I mean, how's Brady even
supposed to know

10:15.816 --> 10:17.350
I'm here in this stupid box?
The guy...

10:17.384 --> 10:19.753
Tom Brady does not care
that you are here.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.656
Guys, nobody leaves the box!
All right? And you.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.825
Take off the goddamn shirt!

10:24.858 --> 10:27.494
-(gasps)
-Whoa.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.296
Oh...

10:29.329 --> 10:31.264
What am I looking at here, Rex?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.533
It's the Invigaron berries, man.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.469
They're loaded with sugar,
but I'm in too deep.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.338
I've got to sell 40 cases
of this stuff

10:38.371 --> 10:39.673
or I'm gonna lose my apartment.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.508
ANNOUNCER: The snap is good,
the hold is perfect...

10:41.541 --> 10:43.443
(all groaning, jeering)

10:43.476 --> 10:47.981
Oh, yes! In your face!
In your face! (laughs)

10:48.015 --> 10:50.017
ANNOUNCER: Brady hands off
to James White.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.384
He's across the 20,

10:51.418 --> 10:54.154
avoids another tackle
and crosses the goal line.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.823
-Touchdown, Patriots.
-(groaning)

10:55.856 --> 10:58.158
Yes! Hell yeah,
another Patriots touchdown.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.227
Tommy Touchdown coming
to get y'all. Yes.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.829
You know what?
You get out, too.

11:01.862 --> 11:02.830
-Oh, yeah?
-Yes.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.964
-I can go?
-Yes.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.665
All right.
Tommy, Mama's coming.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.167
I got to piss.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.969
The stone's making me go.
I got to go.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.071
Frank, I've already taken you,
like, three times, all right?

11:11.104 --> 11:14.007
And all I've got to see are
good plays by the Patriots.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.343
-Let the man piss.
-Yeah, I got to go.

11:16.376 --> 11:20.714
No. Every time Frank goes to
the bathroom, the Eagles score.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.350
(choir sings)

11:23.383 --> 11:25.152
-(grunting)
-Are you pissing?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.687
Piss, Frank, piss.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.822
I'm pissing,
and it hurts like shit.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.190
-What's going on with the game?
-Just...

11:30.223 --> 11:31.859
Just keep peeing. I don't know.
It's not updating.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.560
ANNOUNCER:
...throws into the end zone.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.095
Touchdown!

11:35.128 --> 11:37.197
-Us or them? Us or them?
-I don't know, Frank.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.232
-I don't know.
What happened? Wha...?
-Hey-oh!

11:39.266 --> 11:42.335
-Pondy, what happened?
-Eagles score!

11:42.369 --> 11:45.773
Yes!

11:45.806 --> 11:49.009
Pondy, I need you to bring
as much beer to this bathroom

11:49.042 --> 11:50.510
as you possibly can.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.245
-Frank, drink!
-Got to piss.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.515
I need you to piss through
this entire game, Frank.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.717
-We can't leave this bathroom.
-I want to...

11:57.751 --> 11:58.786
The Eagles need us.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.854
(marching band playing)

12:00.888 --> 12:02.890
*

12:05.959 --> 12:06.960
(clattering)

12:14.902 --> 12:16.469
(indistinct chatter)

12:16.503 --> 12:19.172
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Hold on. You need a pass.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.920
-Hey, whoa, watch out.
Watch where you're going.
-Oop, sorry.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.088
-Open your eyes.
-Sorry. (groans) Oh.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.564
Perfect timing, man.
I need to get this out to Brady.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.233
ANNOUNCER:
Brady's ready to go out.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.336
He's really wiping that sweat
off with that towel.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.770
I mean, he's really
going at it.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.806
Just squirt some out, man,
squirt it out.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.475
I can't piss no more.
It hurts like shit.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.609
You got to force it out, then.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.611
Where's Pondy with the beer? Oh!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.613
You, you! Ten beers, stat.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.083
I'm off duty, just here to go
to the bathroom.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.784
-Mac, the crew got out.
-What?

13:04.818 --> 13:08.121
-REX: It's not just a berry.
-MAC: Oh, no.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.824
It's a berry found deep in the
jungles of the Amazon forest,

13:10.858 --> 13:12.826
and available
for the first time!

13:12.860 --> 13:14.327
I'm a happy client.

13:14.361 --> 13:18.832
First down! Whoo, yeah.
I love you, Tom.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.269
ANNOUNCER
And it's always nice to see

13:22.302 --> 13:24.537
our nation's troops
being honored.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.639
We are Philadelphia!

13:26.673 --> 13:29.509
These guys are a total
embarrassment.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.479
(sighs)
We blew it, man.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.048
Now Brady's got the ball with
two and a half minutes left.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.649
He's gonna take the ball
down the field,

13:36.683 --> 13:38.451
he's gonna score,
and he's gonna win the game.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.387
Because that's who he is, man.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.023
And you know who we are?
We're losers.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.557
All of Philadelphia.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.560
We're angry, and we're mean
and we're cruel.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.829
And we act like jerks,
and now these assholes,

13:49.863 --> 13:52.866
they can't even bring us beer
so that you can pass the stone

13:52.900 --> 13:55.002
and we can win the game.

13:55.035 --> 14:00.207
No. No, no, Mac.
You got 'em all wrong.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.841
No.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.678
Those guys, those guys
are Philadelphia.

14:05.712 --> 14:09.482
They bust their ass every day
just to get through.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.653
And then, on a Sunday, they put
all their hopes into the Eagles.

14:13.686 --> 14:18.358
And year after year after year,
their team lets them down.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.759
And they get angry.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.863
And that anger builds into
a stone of fury.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.766
And if it could
just be released,

14:26.799 --> 14:28.701
then we could feel
something different.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.870
What?

14:30.904 --> 14:34.074
W-Well, then, you, me,
us, those guys,

14:34.107 --> 14:38.611
the whole city of Philadelphia
could feel like champions!

14:38.645 --> 14:40.280
-(grunting)
-Frank.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.882
You got to push that stone out
right now.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.184
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.552
-You can do it.
-I'll piss it out!

14:45.585 --> 14:47.220
Do it for the Birds, Frank.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.123
-Do it for the whole city of
Philadelphia, man, push!
-(grunting)

14:50.157 --> 14:52.725
ANNOUNCER: Brady, with White
to his right, takes the snap.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.028
Do it like Rocky, man. Push.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.630
ANNOUNCER: Brady back, steps up.
He's hit by Brandon Graham.

14:57.664 --> 15:01.068
-(grunting)
-The ball is loose!
-(stone clatters)

15:01.101 --> 15:03.270
(laughs)

15:03.303 --> 15:05.438
ANNOUNCER: And the Eagles
have it! The Eagles have it!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.374
It's recovered
by Derek Barnett!

15:07.407 --> 15:08.942
Brady lost the ball.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.111
Looks like he couldn't
see the defender.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.947
It's-it's like something
was wrong with his eyes.

15:13.981 --> 15:14.948
WAITER:
Brady fumbled.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.483
The Eagles recovered.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.586
-You did it!
-Oh, no, Mac. We did it!

15:19.619 --> 15:21.888
BOTH: We did it!
We did it! We did it.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.556
We did it!
We did it!

15:23.590 --> 15:25.425
I don't know why you care,
fair-weather fan.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.327
Fair-weather fan. You're
from Minnesota, that's okay.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.633
E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!

15:33.666 --> 15:37.004
* Fly, Eagles, fly... *

15:37.037 --> 15:38.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.240
-What?
-What're you singing about?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.408
Oh, I'm over Tommy Fumbles.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.577
I'm all about my man,
Nick Foles!

15:44.611 --> 15:47.014
Gross.
You know, it doesn't matter.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.515
Guys, I have
an announcement to make.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.450
I owe you an apology.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.120
You guys are true
representations

15:53.153 --> 15:54.521
of the city of Philadelphia.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.524
And we came together as a city.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.161
And, guys, we helped the Eagles
win the Super Bowl.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.263
-They won the Super Bowl!
-(cheers)

16:03.296 --> 16:05.632
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.933
Brady got the ball back,
and there's 58 seconds

16:06.966 --> 16:08.301
left in the game.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.869
What did you do?!

16:09.902 --> 16:11.204
You sons of bitches,
this is your fault!

16:11.238 --> 16:12.872
You screwed it up!

16:12.905 --> 16:14.141
What're we gonna do?
What do we do?

16:14.174 --> 16:15.842
Do a superstition. Frank!
Pee! Pee! Pee!

16:15.875 --> 16:19.446
-Hey, I'm dry.
-Somebody do a superstition,
quick!

16:19.479 --> 16:22.015
Charlie!

16:22.049 --> 16:23.283
ANNOUNCER:
The Patriots with the ball

16:23.316 --> 16:24.451
at their own nine yard line.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.852
Oh! Oh, Brady's got the ball.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.687
-ANNOUNCER:
They are out of time outs.
-Wha-What?!

16:27.720 --> 16:29.456
Brady's got the ball
with time on the clock?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.524
Oh, shit. What happened?
What changed?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.561
Yeah, you're gonna have to get
back in that trap.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.329
-Yep.
-Aw, come on, man.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.697
You just told me
to get out of it.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.999
Yeah, that was before
Brady had the ball.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.001
Ah. Does it have to be
the same leg or...

16:42.035 --> 16:44.204
-Same leg.
-Damn it!

16:44.237 --> 16:46.206
Are you sure this is gonna work?

16:46.239 --> 16:48.241
Every single thing
that every fan does,

16:48.275 --> 16:49.809
at home or at the stadium,

16:49.842 --> 16:51.678
makes a direct impact
in the game.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.580
-No, you're right. I want
to help you win out there.
-(phone rings)

16:53.613 --> 16:54.847
Oh, I'm getting a call.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.750
Let me think about this
for a minute.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.386
Hey, what's up, Mac?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.388
Hey, Charlie, what's g...

17:01.421 --> 17:03.056
Whoa, man, what the hell
happened to you?

17:03.090 --> 17:05.225
-It's a long story.
-All right.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.526
Well, did you do your
superstitions?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.361
Brady's going to Gronk;
we're screwed.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.197
I got one thing left to do.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.431
All right, well,
you better hurry up, man.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.732
I'm doing it. Here it goes.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.167
MAC:
He's backing up in the pocket!

17:14.201 --> 17:16.169
ANNOUNCER:
He's back again. He steps up.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.037
-MAC: Brady's backing up.
-ANNOUNCER:
He's hit. He stumbles.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.773
-Do it, do it now!
-He's throwing!

17:20.807 --> 17:23.576
ANNOUNCER: He is going deep
for the end zone,

17:23.610 --> 17:26.113
and it is...

17:26.146 --> 17:29.549
batted around...

17:29.582 --> 17:32.885
and incomplete!

17:32.919 --> 17:35.122
And the game is over!

17:35.155 --> 17:37.224
(laughs)

17:37.257 --> 17:39.459
-(all cheering)
-We did it!

17:39.492 --> 17:42.195
We did it!
The superstitions are real!

17:42.229 --> 17:44.063
Yes!

17:44.097 --> 17:46.133
(cackling)

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
MAC:
Charlie, you did it!

17:47.467 --> 17:48.901
You did it, you were right.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.803
The superstitions were real.
You did it, man!

17:50.837 --> 17:54.073
(wails, laughs)

17:54.107 --> 17:56.443
ANNOUNCER:
What a tremendous Super Bowl.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.146
It is still a mystery as to
what happened with Brady's eye,

17:59.179 --> 18:02.215
but it had to have an effect
on his play late in the game.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.983
What a win for the Eagles,

18:04.016 --> 18:07.287
-and what a win for the city
of Philadelphia.
-We did it!

18:07.320 --> 18:10.623
(all cheering)

18:15.128 --> 18:18.265
*

18:47.527 --> 18:52.932
They did it! They did it!
They did it! They did it.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.136
-It's over!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:57.170 --> 18:59.005
-They did it!
-They did it!

18:59.038 --> 19:01.174
Oh, my God, they did it!

19:08.515 --> 19:11.484
(trio chanting backwards)

19:14.654 --> 19:16.489
