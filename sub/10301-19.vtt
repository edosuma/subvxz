01:17.960 --> 01:20.110
Hey, Kel. Popcorn ready?

01:20.320 --> 01:23.471
I don't know.
How do you know when it's done?

01:25.560 --> 01:28.597
When it's as big as Mom's hair,
it's done.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.958
Nope.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.273
Nope.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.078
It's Mom.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.908
I just love movie night.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.076
It's a chance for us all
to be together.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.238
Except for the fact that Mom and Dad
are too cheap to take us.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.476
So they go and then tell us about it.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.313
Who wants to hear about the movie?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.995
It's starting. It's starting.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.159
I guess no one's gonna have to yell,
" Head down in front" to you, huh, Bud?

02:08.520 --> 02:11.033
Like anyone's seen your head
in a movie in 10 years.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.708
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.871
Now, now, kids.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.551
No fighting on movie night or
I'm not gonna tell you the movie.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.677
That's better.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.510
Okay, first the lights come down.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.633
Then your father stumbles
over everybody, spilling Cokes.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.396
Then comes on a commercial
for some newspaper.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.711
And a plea for the environment.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.518
- Oh, save the children.
- Poor Earth.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.517
Who cares.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.354
<i>And now, our feature presentation:</i>

02:49.560 --> 02:51.118
<i>A Few Good Men.</i>

02:51.320 --> 02:54.710
Well, in the beginning, Nicholson
is really tough and everything...

02:54.920 --> 02:58.595
...but then 90 minutes later,
he gives up. For no apparent reason.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.869
The end.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.198
Wow. What a great movie, Mom.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.714
Just a little too long for me.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.150
No military hooters, Dad?

03:11.520 --> 03:14.353
I don't like starched hooters,
and I didn't spill Cokes...

03:14.560 --> 03:16.790
...and I see no reason to go on living.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.438
Daddy's in a mood.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.599
The cashier at the movie theatre
thought he was 65.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.750
Well, the cashier wouldn't have
thought it if you hadn't said it, Peg.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.837
Well, I had to, Al.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.470
They raised the price of tickets to
$7 and we didn't have enough money.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.309
So then I saw a sign, it said,
" Half price for senior citizens. "

03:37.520 --> 03:40.557
So I called Daddy, " Daddy. "

03:40.800 --> 03:44.429
You know what upsets me, is that the
cashier didn't ask for my license.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.074
She didn't even want any ID
or any proof.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.078
She just believed I was 65.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.038
Well, what did you expect, honey?

03:52.240 --> 03:57.997
She saw a stooped-over prune
of a man with a young dynamite chick.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.515
Hey, who were you standing
next to, Dad?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.356
The Red Reaper.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.278
Kids, I don't really look old, do I?

04:13.080 --> 04:15.514
- Well...
- Let's check this out.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.238
Oh, hey, Bud,
you gotta jiggle his teeth.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.715
Hey, I see a white one.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.388
No, no, that's- That's cheese.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.273
I know the sure test.
Old men have no heinies.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.997
There's proof positive. Well...

04:36.960 --> 04:39.269
Well, look at that round little apple.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.072
Cool, Dad.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.597
Look at his pants.
They just go straight down.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.238
Where do old guys' heinies go?

04:49.480 --> 04:54.554
To that strange, far-off, magical place
called their bellies.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.350
Hope I never lose my butt.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.793
You wouldn't lose
your butt in prison.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.996
Gee, I hope I live to see you at 30.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.270
Or should I say...

05:07.480 --> 05:09.232
...30.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.118
Hi.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.112
Hi there.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.754
Jefferson and I
could use a little help.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.712
<i>We were watching
this old movie on TV...</i>

05:23.920 --> 05:27.799
...with this really great old actor, but
neither of us could think of his name.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.039
So we decided to ask someone
from an older generation.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.995
<i>Al, In Holiday, who played
Cary Grant's best friend?</i>

05:37.200 --> 05:39.873
How would I know, I'm not old.
It's Edward Everett Horton...

05:40.080 --> 05:44.039
...and if you say "Who's he?" you know
damn well I'll tell your real age.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.319
Al, I wouldn't say anything
to embarrass you.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.478
He got into the movies
as a senior citizen.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.158
They thought he was 65.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.836
Really? I thought he was 70.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.997
You must mean IQ.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.875
Well, then, yes, he's definitely 65.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.753
Come on, now, Al isn't 65.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.110
He just looks 65.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.515
Now, you wanna see
a great looking 65-year-old...

06:13.720 --> 06:16.518
...you come knocking
on my door in 40 years.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.950
Oh, but don't come barging in...

06:19.160 --> 06:22.311
...because I'm gonna be in there
with some young chick.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.316
Thank you, honey.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.318
Will you still be living there with us?

06:35.600 --> 06:39.275
The question is,
will you still be living?

06:39.480 --> 06:42.074
Peggy, you're so lucky.

06:42.280 --> 06:47.513
Though yours is about as desirable
as Shredded Wheat without the milk...

06:47.720 --> 06:50.075
...at least he's cheap to keep.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.271
Al, why don't you go
out and get yourself...

06:52.480 --> 06:55.313
...one of those senior citizen
discount cards?

06:55.520 --> 06:58.796
Why, you could use the card
to have a nice " In by 2 p. m...

06:59.000 --> 07:02.072
<i>...out by 2:30" supper at Denny's.</i>

07:03.720 --> 07:05.392
No kidding?

07:06.080 --> 07:10.198
<i>That's pretty good because anything
I eat by 2 is out by 2:30 anyway.</i>

07:12.800 --> 07:14.631
Hey, where can I get
one of them cards?

07:14.880 --> 07:18.509
Well, city hall.
But, Al, you can't seriously do this.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.790
It would be dishonest.
It would be cheating.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.112
Oh, right, I couldn't do
anything like that.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.870
I'm gonna get me one
of them cards right now.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.753
I'll use my senior movie pass as ID.
Oh, but...

07:30.120 --> 07:32.350
...if I'm gonna fool people
to thinking I'm old...

07:32.560 --> 07:35.552
...I'll have to figure a way to
cover up my sexuality.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.630
What about one of those
little round Band-Aids, Al?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.790
She's 60. There, I told.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.191
I'm gonna get you. You better not
be saying things like that...

07:47.400 --> 07:49.914
Mom, I'm a little worried about Dad.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.997
I mean, for a change,
he's gone overboard.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.313
Since his senior discount card, he's
mailing away for anything they offer.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.229
I think there's something different
about him, but you be the judge.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.717
Family, look what I got for 42 cents.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.036
If it wasn't for my
senior discount card...

08:26.240 --> 08:29.437
...this ensemble would have been
in excess of $3.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.830
Honey, not that we're not
gonna discuss your suit...

08:34.039 --> 08:37.554
...but let's begin
where most things end. Your head.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.470
The Grecian Formula, huh? Yeah.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.477
I shampooed it in a little at a time...

08:43.679 --> 08:48.470
...for gradual change, and now
no one knows it's not really my colour.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.594
Yeah, Dad, it- It looks real natural.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.832
I really think I did a nice job.
I put it in myself.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.439
See.

09:00.680 --> 09:04.468
I shampooed it in, and voilÃ .

09:04.680 --> 09:08.389
A new man. God, I'm cool,
and the chicks are loving it.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.870
Can you imagine what it's like
to walk into a bingo parlour...

09:13.080 --> 09:14.911
...hitch up your white belt...

09:15.120 --> 09:18.078
...and know you can have
any woman in there?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.232
Peg, by the way,
I won't be home Friday.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.830
Sadie Blondstein's
making a nice brisket.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.474
The only drawback is I
find myself talking to myself.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.955
No, you don't. Yes, I do.
Why not? You're charming.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.833
Hey, brisket on Friday. No kidding?

09:35.120 --> 09:37.350
So let me know
if you catch me doing it.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.070
Well, kids, can I get a "Whoa, asylum"?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.880
Hey, let's see what we got
in the mail.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.231
Hey...

09:47.440 --> 09:51.274
I've been invited to compete in the
Chicago Area Athletic Championships.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.755
Well, can't turn this down.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.549
So scare the big spider off the mantel,
because there's a new trophy coming.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.149
Nothing can stop me now.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.633
Except getting it in the cup
during drug testing.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.199
- Dad, did you read this?
- Sure.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.516
It says, "See you
at the championships. "

10:13.720 --> 10:17.190
It says, "Senior Championships. "

10:17.440 --> 10:20.159
This is for people over 65.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.872
Perhaps your hair
was leaking into your eyes.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.678
Honey, you know, that's
10 events in two days.

10:27.880 --> 10:31.555
You can't even handle
one event in two minutes.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.389
Mom's 80.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.792
Hey, Mom, when did you start going
through, you know, mental-pause?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.988
Right after I had you, honey.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.516
Dad, you can't possibly
beat these old guys.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.312
They're in great shape.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.988
For once in your life,
quit while you're still behind.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.953
- So you don't think I can win, eh?
- Oh, Daddy, I think you can win.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.439
I made a joke.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.791
That was good.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.430
So an old woman, a gnome
and a dullard don't think I can win.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.830
- No.
- No, we actually don't.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.993
Well, I can, and I will
win these championships.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.714
Bring me your tired,
your old, your wrinkled...

11:18.920 --> 11:21.434
...old masses yearning
to ride the bus for free.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.198
Bring them all on.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.233
Your 70-year-olds, your 80-year-olds,
your 90-year-olds.

11:26.440 --> 11:31.389
Bring them in their canes and walkers
and wheelchairs. I'll bury them all.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.272
Because that's the kind of man
your daddy is.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.952
Good boy.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.115
Well, at least now I can say
I've been to a Dead concert.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.599
Get your Maalox,
red-hot suppositories...

12:27.800 --> 12:30.792
...stewed prunes,
already-chewed food.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.670
<i>Get on your marks.</i>

12:36.640 --> 12:38.153
<i>Get set.</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:41.272
What?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.158
Daddy's losing.

12:45.360 --> 12:50.480
Well, be specific.
His hair, his teeth, the race? What?

12:53.240 --> 12:56.152
<i>And Bundy is fifth.</i>

12:59.800 --> 13:01.518
Hey, Mom, was Dad ever any good?

13:01.720 --> 13:05.110
He talks about it all the time,
but was he ever really a great athlete?

13:05.320 --> 13:08.357
Well, actually, kids,
he was really something.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.710
I remember one play in particular.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.275
Everybody thought Daddy
was really boxed in.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.914
So he threw a fake,
broke four tackles...

13:16.120 --> 13:20.079
...straight-armed a guy right in the
teeth and ran for daylight.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.748
It was the best run I'd ever seen.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.633
He'd still be running
if my uncle hadn't clubbed him...

13:25.840 --> 13:29.628
...with the butt of his shotgun
and dragged him back to the wedding.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.749
<i>So, in answer to your question:</i>

13:33.960 --> 13:39.717
Yes, he was a great athlete,
but no, he was never any good.

13:41.440 --> 13:46.195
<i>Forty-seven feet. Next up, Al Bundy.</i>

13:58.360 --> 14:00.476
<i>Six inches.</i>

14:01.440 --> 14:03.556
Measure it again!

14:09.560 --> 14:12.950
<i>Next up at the pole vault,
Al Bundy mak es his jump.</i>

14:22.920 --> 14:24.990
Get up, Al. Get up.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.237
This had better not be
Sadie the brisket woman.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.633
It's not. Sadie don't have no cat.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.390
Oh, God, I hurt.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.473
Honey. You should be pretty proud.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.678
After one full day's events,
with men who, in some cases...

14:45.880 --> 14:49.714
...are twice your age,
you're in 15th place.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.953
Look on the bright side, Daddy.

14:52.160 --> 14:57.792
You are the 15th best elderly athlete
in the entire Chicago area.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.675
Yeah, Dad, we're all proud
the way you nailed that cat.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.034
I took him out pretty good, didn't I?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.510
You sure did, killer.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.348
Why don't we cut the charade, Dad.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.558
You know, we don't ask for much.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.150
Just once, why don't you dig deep
and show us the man you really are?

15:19.360 --> 15:21.191
Make us proud, big guy.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.913
Quit.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.916
- You'll always have the cat.
- Yeah, I guess I can't top that.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.350
All right, I quit.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.068
Can't beat those guys, anyway,
they got the edge on me.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.350
Most of their wives are dead.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.236
You know, Peg, if you loved me,
you'd be dead already too.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.431
Yeah, if.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.719
<i>All right, but understand this:</i>

15:46.920 --> 15:48.797
I was a cinch to win that thing.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.198
We know you were, Dad.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.789
Yeah, Dad, you can do anything.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.791
I made another joke.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.913
Al, you could really use some
encouragement, couldn't you?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.390
Yes, Peg, I could.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.352
Good night, honey.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.869
It didn't always used to be like this.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.994
<i>All right, boys.
We're down three touchdowns...</i>

16:22.200 --> 16:24.873
<i>...we don't have a chance,
so let's quit.</i>

16:25.080 --> 16:28.709
<i>Quit? Sorry, coach,
but I'm taking over now.</i>

16:28.920 --> 16:32.469
<i>Okay, you guys, you give me
the ball and get out of my way.</i>

16:32.680 --> 16:35.433
<i>Al Bundy doesn't quit.</i>

16:36.720 --> 16:38.870
Peg, wake up!

16:39.080 --> 16:40.798
Oh, no, Al.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.431
Are you reliving when you slapped
the coach and took over the team?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.432
Peg, shut up.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.035
Kids, get in here!

16:52.520 --> 16:54.715
I have made a decision.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.992
I am going back
to the competition tomorrow...

16:58.200 --> 17:00.509
...and I want you there,
and I want you cheering.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.029
And this time
I want you cheering for me.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.914
Al Bundy is not a quitter.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.117
Now get out.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.073
No, not you.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.596
This used to be my event too, baby.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.868
Well, kids, he proved it
to me last night...

17:29.080 --> 17:31.230
<i>...and I want
the whole world to know:</i>

17:31.440 --> 17:34.159
Your father is a quitter.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.679
Of course, he thinks he did good.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.836
Probably because I screamed "Al"
when he jabbed his elbow into my eye.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.353
- How am I doing?
- Oh, honey, I can't believe it.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.959
You're in second place.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.152
Now there's one more event.
The 1500-meter race.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.669
Win that, and you take it all.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.030
Al, we are so proud of you.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.879
You're beating all the old men.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.913
Beating them?

18:36.120 --> 18:38.236
I'm killing them.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.998
Well, it looks like it's gonna be
a duel between you and me.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.633
It's gonna be rough.

18:48.840 --> 18:54.153
I'm a long-distance man, but I'm gonna
win this event and take that gold.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.793
Means a lot to me.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.549
So much, I actually considered
competing before I was 65...

18:59.760 --> 19:01.432
...just to get an edge.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.074
Pathetic, huh?

19:06.160 --> 19:09.550
Well, what kind of an example
would that be for the grandkids.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.194
So I trained for a whole year.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.312
And I'm gonna win it fair and square.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.992
Good luck, honey.
You're gonna need it against that guy.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.631
Do you think so?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.910
Yeah, sure, he does
a lot of running...

19:27.120 --> 19:28.792
...but stamina's my strong point.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.195
Well, no, not with you.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.995
With you, stamina's a bad thing.
It prolongs the agony.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.995
I'm talking about something
that excites a man. Sports.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.478
But you know, winning means
an awful lot to that old guy.

19:45.680 --> 19:49.070
So, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna
run the race until I know I got it won.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.794
Then I'm gonna slow up
and let him win because...

19:52.000 --> 19:55.276
...I'd have to be pretty pathetic
to want glory bad enough...

19:55.480 --> 19:59.473
...to cheat an old man out of a victory
he's dreamed of for years.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.434
See you at the finish line, baby.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.597
And if history
has taught us anything...

20:11.800 --> 20:15.031
...you'll be asleep by the time
I get there.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.636
<i>Runners in the 1500,
tak e your marks.</i>

20:18.840 --> 20:20.068
<i>- What? What?
- Get set.</i>

20:20.280 --> 20:22.032
What? What?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.875
The hell with him.
That trophy's mine!

22:10.240 --> 22:15.189
It's only cheating if you get caught.
