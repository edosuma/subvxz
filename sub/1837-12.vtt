00:06.400 --> 00:08.934
Guess who?

00:08.934 --> 00:11.300
She's sweet, adorable,

00:11.300 --> 00:14.934
and she's gonna get real
mad if you get it wrong.

00:14.934 --> 00:16.600
Hey, Rae.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.500
Hey! You win a kiss.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.934
Mwa! Thank you very much.

00:19.934 --> 00:21.767
So, you want to
hang out tonight?

00:21.767 --> 00:25.000
Um... tonight's
not really good.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.734
I'm not gonna pry, you know.

00:28.734 --> 00:29.834
I'm not gonna be

00:29.834 --> 00:31.033
one of those girlfriends

00:31.033 --> 00:33.200
who's all up in your business.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.867
Okay, cool. Thanks, Rae.

00:34.867 --> 00:35.834
Oh, okay. Bye.

00:35.834 --> 00:37.367
Bye, Devon.
Bye, sweetie.

00:37.367 --> 00:39.300
I'll talk to you
later, okay?

00:40.867 --> 00:44.000
Something is definitely
going on with that boy.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.467
Are you and Devon okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.367
It's just he's been
acting weird all week.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.834
Eddie, you're a guy--
what do you think's going on?

00:49.834 --> 00:52.133
Well, uh, normally,
Rae, when a guy acts
like that, I mean,

00:52.133 --> 00:53.767
he's got something
big on his mind.

00:53.767 --> 00:54.900
Or something small.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.000
Uh,

00:57.000 --> 00:58.767
maybe he's just hungry.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.800
Why do you answer
when you really don't even know?

01:00.800 --> 01:02.300
I'm a guy, it's what we do.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.834
Holla.

Raven's gonna love it!

01:18.500 --> 01:20.467
Chels!
What?

01:20.467 --> 01:23.500
I know why Devon
has been acting weird.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.467
He bought me jewelry!

And, Chelsea!
What?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.133
You're the one who saw it,
and you said,

01:32.133 --> 01:33.967
"Oh, my goodness,
Raven's gonna love it"!

01:33.967 --> 01:35.500
I love when I'm in your visions!

01:35.500 --> 01:37.300
It's like...
it's like I'm starring

01:37.300 --> 01:39.600
in my own little movie
that only you can see.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.700
(<i>laughs </i>):
That's adorable. Now, listen up.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.233
I want you to
follow Devon, okay,

01:43.233 --> 01:45.834
'cause you're the
only one who's gonna
know what he got me.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.934
Okay, yeah.
And as the star
of my vision,

01:47.934 --> 01:51.100
Uh-huh?
I'm trusting you
to make this one

03:02.100 --> 03:04.700
Here we are, alone
in the hallway,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.767
just you and me,
and maybe,

03:06.767 --> 03:09.700
I don't know, something sparkly.

Why are you talking like that?

Why, whatever do you mean,
you funny,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.400
funny boy?

Look, Chels, I'm going through
kind of a weird time right now.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.000
Well...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.500
you should let it out.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.800
You know, it's not good
to keep things in your heart

03:23.800 --> 03:25.400
or your mind

03:25.400 --> 03:27.700
or your pocket.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.200
Okay, look, there's something
I have to tell Raven,

03:30.200 --> 03:32.900
and I've been putting it off
and putting it off, and...

03:32.900 --> 03:35.000
I feel like
I need to talk to someone.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.367
Ooh, ooh, you should talk to me.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.100
Okay, look.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.233
Check this out.

Devon, that is beautiful!

03:43.100 --> 03:44.500
Raven's gonna love it!

03:46.000 --> 03:48.834
Okay, Rae,
I'm in the vision now.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.300
Hello, Rae.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.567
That is a wedding ring.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.600
Are you going to ask Raven
to marry you?

03:54.600 --> 03:57.300
No. It's not for her.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.000
(<i>gasps </i>)

03:59.000 --> 04:03.500
Whoa, whoa, Devon,
this is so sudden.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
I mean... wow, I mean, sure,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.867
you know, you're
an attractive guy, and I...

04:07.867 --> 04:09.867
Come on, you're so young,
you know,

04:09.867 --> 04:12.467
and Raven's
my best friend.

04:12.467 --> 04:15.133
Guess I picked a bad time
to tie my shoe.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.300
You think?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.100
Look,

04:19.100 --> 04:21.000
the ring's
for my father.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
He's getting remarried tonight,
and I'm his best man.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.133
Aw, how sweet.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.400
Why didn't you tell Raven
about this?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.934
There's more to the story.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.200
Oh, man.
What? What is it?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.600
Look, Raven has to hear this
from me, okay?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.200
So you have to promise me
you won't tell her.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.467
I promise.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.700
Okay...

04:43.300 --> 04:47.600
Mom, Dad,
happy anniversary.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.500
Cory, honey,

04:49.500 --> 04:52.367
that's so thoughtful!

04:52.367 --> 04:55.467
But, honey, our anniversary
isn't till next month.

04:55.467 --> 04:58.600
But we will take
the presents now, thank you.

and I just had
to get it for you.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.000
Well, um, thank you
very much, Cory.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.500
We are certainly
gonna enjoy this one.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.767
Yes.
Wait, wait.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.467
Aren't you gonna hang Clucky up?

05:35.467 --> 05:37.600
Where?

05:37.600 --> 05:40.133
Right up there on the wall.

05:40.133 --> 05:43.500
Um, you know, I would,
but, um, I...

05:43.500 --> 05:45.367
I misplaced the hammer.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.600
Don't worry about it.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.000
I got the hook up.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.400
Cory, I don't need any help
buying a hammer.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.600
No, Dad...

05:52.600 --> 05:55.100
I got the hook up on the<i>wall.</i>

05:55.934 --> 05:57.100

Oh.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.200

On the wall.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.800
Well, I guess, then,
there's no reason<i>not</i>
to hang up Clucky

unless-- Tonya?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.133

06:15.033 --> 06:18.100

06:18.100 --> 06:19.400
The coolest part is...

06:20.867 --> 06:23.300
...his eyes have
a motion detector,

06:23.300 --> 06:25.500
so every time you walk by,

06:25.500 --> 06:26.600
he clucks,

06:26.600 --> 06:29.500
we laugh!

(<i>clucking waltz </i>)

(<i>chuckles </i>):
Hey, Chels, you need
to stop reading

06:40.567 --> 06:42.300
and tell me what's
happening with Devon.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.500
Rae, I'm sorry, man--
I love these comics.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.033
Bubble Gum Jim is so funny.

06:46.033 --> 06:47.900
Chels?
Yeah?

06:47.900 --> 06:49.700
What is going on?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.100
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.200
Okay, so, the reason he threw
the clock out the window

06:53.200 --> 06:57.000
is because he wanted
to see time fly. Get it?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.867
It's so funny.
Hey, Chels.

06:58.867 --> 07:00.600
You're gonna see
something fly

07:00.600 --> 07:02.467
if you don't stop
changing the subject

07:02.467 --> 07:03.800
and tell me what Devon said.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.934
I'm sorry, I can't.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.900
I promised him
I wouldn't say anything.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.734
Are you... Chels!

07:08.734 --> 07:10.834
When we were six,
we made a promise

07:10.834 --> 07:13.100
that we would
tell each other everything.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.000
So which promise is
more important?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.367
Well, you are my best friend,
you know,

07:17.367 --> 07:19.700
and I'm probably not going
to see Devon again,

07:19.700 --> 07:22.500
and, you know, he didn't want
to marry me anyway. What?!

07:22.500 --> 07:23.900
Is that Clucky

07:23.900 --> 07:25.300
the Singing Chicken?!

07:25.300 --> 07:27.734

(<i>Clucky clucking</i>

07:30.867 --> 07:33.567
Ah, endlessly hilarious.
It's so funny.
Okay, heh, Chels,

07:33.567 --> 07:36.667
I need you to rewind
back to the marrying part.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.233
You with me? Okay.
Yeah.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.800
And tell me
how that came up.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.100
Well, I guess it all came up
with the wedding ring.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.600
(<i>quietly </i>):
What?

07:45.667 --> 07:48.700
(<i>laughs </i>):
There was a wedding ring.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.900
Yeah, it was just like
in your vision, Rae,

07:51.900 --> 07:54.600
but before you get all excited,
it wasn't for you.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.400
Or for me.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.734
It was for Chandra.

07:59.734 --> 08:00.834
Oh. Chandra.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.500
(<i>chuckles </i>)

08:02.500 --> 08:04.734
Who the heck is Chandra?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.900
Look, all right, maybe I should
just start from the beginning.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.700
Yeah, uh, that would be nice.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.400
Okay. Devon's dad's
getting remarried

08:10.400 --> 08:13.033
to a woman named Chandra,
and, um, Devon is the best man,

08:13.033 --> 08:14.967
so that's why
he was carrying the ring.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.100
Oh. Okay. So, um, Chels,

08:16.100 --> 08:17.133
let's get to the part

08:17.133 --> 08:18.600
about never seeing
Devon again.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.400
Um...

08:20.400 --> 08:21.600
Rae, that's the hard part

08:21.600 --> 08:23.467
he doesn't really know
how to tell you.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.200
You tell me.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.600
Okay, Rae, um...

08:27.600 --> 08:29.400
Chandra lives in Seattle,

08:29.400 --> 08:32.300
and Devon and his whole family
are going to move there.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.367
(<i>clears throat </i>):
Seattle?

08:41.367 --> 08:43.700
Yeah, Rae,
it's not that far.

08:43.700 --> 08:48.934
Chels, it might as well be
on the other side of the world.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.734
(<i>softly </i>):
I'm sorry, Rae.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.367
Hey, Rae, I got here
as soon as I could.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.400
I can't believe
Devon's moving away.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.200
What's the point
of being psychic

09:09.200 --> 09:10.967
if I couldn't see this coming?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.567
This is messed up.
He really should've
told you, Rae.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.100
Well, he wanted to,
he just...

09:15.100 --> 09:16.467
just didn't really
know how.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.233
How about just
stepping up and
saying it?

09:18.233 --> 09:20.400
Well, come on,
he didn't want
to break her heart.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.700
And this is better, Chels?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.567
A broken woman
searching for happiness

09:23.567 --> 09:25.567
at the bottom
of an empty cookie bag?

09:32.200 --> 09:35.300
You're right. This is pathetic.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.567
I'm gonna take some action.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.500
Gonna get more cookies.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.834
Rae.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.500
Okay, you're right.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.900
I'm gonna call Devon, then
I'm gonna get some more cookies.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.934
No. Come on, no.
Give me the phone.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.500
You are not calling
Devon, okay?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.767
Then he's gonna know I broke
my promise and that I told you.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.834
Well, what am I gonna do,
sit here and do nothing?

09:54.834 --> 09:56.600
It doesn't even matter
if you talk to Devon, okay?

09:56.600 --> 09:57.967
His father is the one
getting married.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.800
Well, then maybe I need
to talk to his father.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.400
And say what, "I love your son,
please don't move"?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.233
Yeah. Why not?
What do I have to lose?

10:04.233 --> 10:06.500
If he sees how much
we care about each other,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.600
maybe he'll change his mind
about moving.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
Well, Rae, you better talk
to him pretty soon.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.900
Well, why?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.667
Because they're moving
right after the wedding.

10:13.667 --> 10:14.900
Okay. When's the wedding?

10:14.900 --> 10:17.233
Well... uh, well,
looks like right now.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.300
Snap!

10:23.200 --> 10:25.900
Anybody know
where the wedding is?

10:28.033 --> 10:29.834
(<i>organ playing </i>)

10:29.834 --> 10:31.667
(<i>whispers </i>):
Okay.

10:31.667 --> 10:35.200
The ceremony's
already started.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.600
Ooh, Devon is looking
<i>fine </i>in that tuxedo.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.300
Okay, Rae, Rae,
hey, hey, focus.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.133
Right, right,
right... okay.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.033
EDDIE:
Hey, his dad isn't going
down the aisle yet.

10:49.033 --> 10:52.834
You still have a chance--
just don't let Devon see you.
Right, come on.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.233
(<i>organ music continues </i>)

10:58.567 --> 11:00.667
(<i>whispers </i>):
Mr. Carter.

11:01.734 --> 11:03.133
Mr. Carter.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.900
Carter!

11:08.300 --> 11:09.500
You probably don't know me,

11:09.500 --> 11:11.300
but you've probably heard of me.
I'm Raven.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.133
I really don't want
Devon to see me.

11:13.133 --> 11:14.467
It's kind of
complicated,

11:14.467 --> 11:16.000
but some promises
were made...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
It's really nice
chatting with you,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.400
but I kind of made
some promises of my own.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
No, but I need to talk to you.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.667
It's only going
to take a second.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.133
You'd better make it fast.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.100
Hello, Raven.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.200
We meet again.

11:33.233 --> 11:38.000
Hey, it's Devon's adorable
little sister.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.800
How you been, Danni?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.000
I'm glad you're here.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.500
Now we can say good-bye...

11:46.500 --> 11:49.100
forever.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.867
Hey, you work things out
with Mr. Carter?

12:02.867 --> 12:04.033
No, I was this close.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.900
I just needed another second.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.400
Snap! Duck!

12:08.400 --> 12:09.600
I don't want Devon to see us.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
Okay, Eddie, listen.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.867
I want you
to stay here
and stall.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.000
Chelsea,
you come with me.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.867
We're going
to figure out
our next move.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.900
All right-- snap, duck,
stall, move-- got it.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.033
I'm from
the Organ Players Union.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.400
It's time for your break.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.667
(<i>playing "Charge" </i>)

12:38.300 --> 12:39.967
(<i>playing crescendo </i>)

12:43.934 --> 12:45.700
Okay, Chels,
we have to figure out a way

12:45.700 --> 12:47.200
to get to Mr. Carter--
Now think.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
Okay.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.967
Uh...

12:49.967 --> 12:52.467
(<i>grunting with effort </i>)

12:52.467 --> 12:53.834
Don't hurt yourself.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.367
Oh.

12:55.367 --> 12:58.200
CHANDRA:
Mama, is that you?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.767
It's the bride.
It's the bride.

13:00.767 --> 13:01.767
Say something.
Say something.

13:01.767 --> 13:02.834
You gotta
say something.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.467
(<i>clearing throat </i>):
Okay, um...

13:04.467 --> 13:06.567
(<i>mature voice </i>):
Uh, yes, baby, it's me.

13:06.567 --> 13:07.567
I'm your mama.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.400
How you doing, child?

13:09.400 --> 13:11.834
I'm going to be awhile.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.100
It's, it's my stomach.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.967
I shouldn't have had
all those chili dogs

13:15.967 --> 13:17.133
at my bachelorette party.

13:17.133 --> 13:19.400
Oh, ew.
Oh, ew.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.600
Gross, nasty.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.500
Um, uh, okay, baby,
well, just take your time

13:24.500 --> 13:27.867
and your man
is not going anywhere.

13:27.867 --> 13:31.400
Not going anywhere.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.800
He's just gonna...
stay right here.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.367
Chels.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.200
You wouldn't.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.100
Then I shouldn't.

13:40.100 --> 13:40.734
But you must.

13:40.734 --> 13:41.400
Then I will.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.100
Are you sure?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.033
I don't know.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.100
Wait.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.500
Don't let Clucky see us.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.000
Right.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.033
Wait.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.300
Why are we whispering?

13:55.300 --> 13:56.967
Clucky has
a motion detector.

13:56.967 --> 14:00.400
He might see our lips moving.

14:02.367 --> 14:03.467
Stay low.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.367
You forgot ice.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.600
I can't go back.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.767
It's too dangerous.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.600
That's it.
I can't take it anymore.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.767
We can't even walk around
our own house

14:25.767 --> 14:28.400
without hearing that
stupid clucking chicken.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.500
(<i>clucking "Blue Danube Waltz" </i>)

14:38.400 --> 14:41.100
Don't break Clucky.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.900
Let me do it.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.967
No, no.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.967
We'll just take
the batteries out.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.400
(<i>Clucky squawks </i>)

14:50.400 --> 14:51.800
Ha-ha.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.000
(<i>clucking stops </i>)

14:53.000 --> 14:57.400
You have run
out of clucking.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.500
Dad, what are you doing?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.367
(<i>clucking resumes </i>)

15:00.367 --> 15:01.500
Um...

15:01.500 --> 15:03.667
Oh, you don't have
to change the batteries.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.200
They're just for backup.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.400
He's got
a built-in power system.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.467
Wow, they think
of everything.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.867
Don't worry, guys.

15:13.867 --> 15:16.400
Clucky's going to cluck forever.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.600
(<i>clucking and squawking </i>)

15:25.934 --> 15:29.367
(<i>playing "If You're Happy</i>
<i>And You Know It" </i>)

15:36.300 --> 15:38.133
You're not the organ player.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.000
Of course I am, little girl.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.467
This is an organ,

15:42.467 --> 15:44.367
and I'm playing it.

15:44.367 --> 15:47.300
Well, it's time to play
"Here Comes The Bride."

15:47.300 --> 15:49.000
And if I don't?

15:50.200 --> 15:56.100
(<i>playing dramatic chords </i>)

15:59.233 --> 16:00.767
(<i>playing "Wedding March" </i>)

16:07.400 --> 16:10.500
(<i>"Wedding March" continuing </i>)

16:12.700 --> 16:14.367
Play faster.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.567
Here's the deal:

16:17.567 --> 16:18.900
Raven kind of borrowed
the bride's wedding gown,

16:18.900 --> 16:20.500
so if she doesn't get down
that aisle in a hurry,

16:20.500 --> 16:21.834
things are going
to get pretty ugly.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.200
Oh, I hear you. Okay.
Let's do something.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.667
(<i>playing faster </i>)

16:34.734 --> 16:36.033
(<i>clears throat </i>)

16:37.133 --> 16:39.367
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here today

16:39.367 --> 16:40.934
to join this man
and this woman.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.600
(<i>whispers </i>):
We have to talk.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.033
Honey, we're about
to be married.

16:44.033 --> 16:46.500
She's just a little bit nervous.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.800
Moving right along.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.300
If anyone present
has any objection...

16:50.300 --> 16:51.500
Yeah, I do.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.700
Honey, the "I do's"
don't come until later.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.467
Please continue
with the ceremony.

16:55.467 --> 16:57.000
No, you can't.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.934
I love your son.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.100
(<i>all gasp </i>)

17:01.100 --> 17:02.500
No, y'all don't understand.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.500
I'm only 15.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.033
(<i>all gasp </i>)

17:07.033 --> 17:08.100
Ooh, no, no, no.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.233
I'm not the bride.

17:10.233 --> 17:13.200
(<i>sighs of relief </i>)

17:13.200 --> 17:14.800
Raven?!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.667
Raven?!

17:16.667 --> 17:18.367
So where's my bride?

17:18.367 --> 17:22.400
Oh, there was a party

17:22.400 --> 17:24.600
and some chili dogs...

17:24.600 --> 17:27.233
But Mr. Carter, I wanted
to talk to you before you moved.

17:27.233 --> 17:28.700
Um...

17:28.700 --> 17:30.867
Devon and I

17:30.867 --> 17:34.367
have something really special.

17:34.367 --> 17:37.967
And if you move to Seattle,
it'll be over,

17:37.967 --> 17:43.133
so I came here to ask you,
please, please, don't go.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.467
Wait, let me get this straight:

17:44.467 --> 17:45.934
All right,
you crashed my wedding,

17:45.934 --> 17:47.233
you stole the gown,

17:47.233 --> 17:49.133
you impersonate my bride,
and then you just...?

17:49.133 --> 17:50.934
Okay, you know what?
If you lump it

17:50.934 --> 17:53.567
together like that,
it's going to sound bad.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.367
But if you separated it,

17:55.367 --> 17:57.133
and get to the root
of the situation...

17:57.133 --> 17:58.934
Dad, can I have
a second with
Raven, please?

17:58.934 --> 17:59.867
Just don't mind me.

17:59.867 --> 18:00.934
I'm just looking
for my bride.

18:00.934 --> 18:03.734
Chandra?

18:03.734 --> 18:06.200
Raven, I know all of this
is happening so fast,

18:06.200 --> 18:07.600
but, I mean, look at my dad.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.000
He's never been happier.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.567
Well, my point is,
we're moving

18:15.567 --> 18:17.767
and he's not going
to change his mind.

18:17.767 --> 18:22.767
Yeah, it's kind of crazy
for me to come here, wasn't it?

18:22.767 --> 18:25.500
I just had to give it a shot.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.200
Look, Ray, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about all of this.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.500
I was going to come over
and talk before we left.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.300
We can talk now.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.700
Okay, look...

18:34.700 --> 18:36.767
I think you're really amazing

18:36.767 --> 18:39.100
and I'll never forget you.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.367
Will I ever see you again?

18:41.367 --> 18:44.200
I hope so.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.467
I love you, Rae.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.934
I love you too, Devon.

18:56.233 --> 18:57.900
Weddings always
kind of make me cry.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.033
(<i>playing "Wedding March" </i>)

19:01.033 --> 19:02.667
Hold it.
(<i>music stops </i>)

19:02.667 --> 19:05.100
No one's gotten married yet.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.767
Seriously,
has anyone seen Chandra?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.100
She stole my dress

19:13.100 --> 19:14.500
and my husband.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.033
Yeah, I think
I spotted her.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.700
Catch.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.233
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.400
(<i>playing "Wedding March" </i>)

19:46.667 --> 19:47.834
Good-bye, Rae.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.667
Bye, Devon.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.467
(<i>clucking "Blue Danube Waltz" </i>)

20:34.867 --> 20:36.400
Mom, Dad...

20:37.767 --> 20:39.200
Mom, Dad!

20:39.200 --> 20:40.734
Mom. Ears.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.834
I have tried to be strong

20:45.834 --> 20:48.200
these past couple of weeks,

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
but I'm about to crack.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.467
Oh, Rae, honey,

20:52.467 --> 20:54.100
I thought you
were starting

20:54.100 --> 20:55.934
to be okay with
Devon moving.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.033
Oh, I am, Mom, it's...

20:58.033 --> 21:00.467
it's that chicken.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.133
(<i>squawks </i>)

21:02.133 --> 21:04.000
Who are you telling?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.133
You know,
Raven is right.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.300
We should just
explain to Corey

21:07.300 --> 21:09.400
that his very appreciated
and thoughtful gift

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
is driving us
up the wall!

21:11.400 --> 21:12.800
Yes.

21:23.667 --> 21:24.734
(<i>clucking stops </i>)

21:24.734 --> 21:28.600
Whew! Yes!

21:28.600 --> 21:30.100
I don't know
about you guys,

21:30.100 --> 21:35.734
but Clucky was plucking
my last nerve.

21:35.734 --> 21:38.033
Yeah, that act
was getting kind of old.

21:38.033 --> 21:40.700
Yeah. Oh, we're going
to miss him.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.667
Clucky, bye, bye.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.700
And hello, Sir Quackington.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.667
Does Sir Quackington sing?

21:47.667 --> 21:48.500
No.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.700
(<i>relieved sighs </i>)

21:49.700 --> 21:52.200
He makes wise quacks.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.233
(<i>Corey laughs </i>)

21:54.000 --> 21:56.100
You're ugly. Quack, quack.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.300
Busted. Quack, quack.
