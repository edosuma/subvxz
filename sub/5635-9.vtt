00:17.064 --> 00:19.165
LINDA: <i> Yay!</i>

00:19.166 --> 00:20.700
Family TV night.

00:20.701 --> 00:23.036
Chippin' and sittin'
and channel flippin'...

00:23.037 --> 00:24.537
it's everything we're good at.

00:24.572 --> 00:26.172
Also windsurfing.
We never tried it,

00:26.173 --> 00:27.740
but I think
we'd surprise ourselves.

00:27.775 --> 00:30.276
I tried windsurfing once.
That's the whole story.

00:30.277 --> 00:31.878
Shh. I love this commercial.

00:31.879 --> 00:33.413
Everyone, shh.

00:33.447 --> 00:35.014
I'm the Sofa Queen,

00:35.015 --> 00:37.116
and I'm here to banish
your ugly furniture.

00:37.117 --> 00:39.686
This child's bedroom
set offends me.

00:39.687 --> 00:41.287
Off with his bed.

00:41.288 --> 00:43.490
Boom! Just like that,
he's got a new bed.

00:43.524 --> 00:45.692
That's a futon fit for a fool.

00:45.693 --> 00:48.194
I'm gonna replace it,
but with a couch,

00:48.229 --> 00:50.597
(mouthing): because normal
adults do not own futons.

00:50.598 --> 00:53.199
Lin? Are you mouthing along
with the commercial? Shh!

00:53.200 --> 00:54.734
(mouthing):
I command my subjects

00:54.768 --> 00:57.203
to visit the Sofa Queen
Furniture Outlet.

00:57.204 --> 00:58.972
Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.

00:58.973 --> 01:01.074
Boi-oi-oi-oing!

01:01.075 --> 01:03.376
Aw. I love the Sofa Queen.

01:03.377 --> 01:05.245
Her sofas are firm
but they're fair.

01:05.245 --> 01:06.746
Uh, Dad?
Yeah?

01:06.747 --> 01:08.081
While we're on
the subject of couches,

01:08.082 --> 01:09.749
maybe it would be a good
time for you and Mom

01:09.750 --> 01:11.733
to have, you know, the talk? Oh.

01:11.752 --> 01:13.286
What's she mean?
What talk?

01:13.287 --> 01:15.488
Is this about how messy
Mom's purse has been?

01:15.489 --> 01:17.924
I love balled-up receipts
as much as the next guy,

01:17.925 --> 01:19.926
but come on!
No, Gene.

01:19.927 --> 01:22.662
Um, Lin, you really love
the Sofa Queen, right?

01:22.663 --> 01:24.597
Maybe we should
go to her store sometime.

01:24.598 --> 01:25.932
Ooh, fun.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.033
That would be fun.

01:27.067 --> 01:29.002
And...? Dad...?

01:29.003 --> 01:31.437
Uh, and while we're there,

01:31.438 --> 01:32.872
maybe we could get a new couch.

01:32.907 --> 01:34.240
What?!

01:34.275 --> 01:36.443
No, Bobby, no. I love our couch.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.945
It's family.
No, no, absolutely not. No.

01:38.946 --> 01:41.314
<i>We're</i> family. And we're
sitting on the floor.

01:41.315 --> 01:43.016
The couch smells
really bad, Lin.

01:43.017 --> 01:44.918
It smells like memories.

01:44.919 --> 01:46.553
Memory musk.

01:46.587 --> 01:48.588
It smells like if all the food
we've spilled on it

01:48.589 --> 01:51.057
had a war with all the butts
that sat on it.

01:51.091 --> 01:52.926
(inhaling)
I'm mostly getting Dad.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.028
The stuffing in the cushions
is all lumpy.

01:55.029 --> 01:57.197
Well your cushions are
pretty lumpy, too, mister.

01:57.198 --> 01:59.966
Aw, I love your lumps. Come on, let me
t... Come on, let me t... Ow, ow. Ow!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.102
Mom, there's a damp
spot on the couch

02:02.103 --> 02:03.269
that somehow never dries.

02:03.304 --> 02:04.471
Ever!
It's always there!

02:04.472 --> 02:06.539
Yeah, like magic. It's special.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.541
Mmm!
We have a history

02:08.542 --> 02:11.978
with this couch. Gene had his
first throw up on it, 'member?

02:12.012 --> 02:13.146
(grunts)

02:13.147 --> 02:14.380
I remember that happening

02:14.381 --> 02:15.849
in an infinity pool,
but whatever.

02:15.850 --> 02:18.551
Tina teethed on the armrest.
Remember that?

02:18.552 --> 02:20.753
(mumbles)

02:20.788 --> 02:22.956
Yeah, we called the pediatrician
to see if couch foam

02:22.957 --> 02:25.125
was okay for babies.
He said no.

02:25.126 --> 02:26.526
Aw, he did.

02:26.527 --> 02:28.027
He said she could've
choked and died.

02:28.028 --> 02:29.362
And you, Louise,

02:29.396 --> 02:30.697
with your couch forts.

02:30.731 --> 02:32.098
Fire!

02:32.133 --> 02:33.666
Ugh, Mom, we get it.

02:33.667 --> 02:35.969
The couch is just a thing.
And when things are old,

02:35.970 --> 02:37.904
you get rid of 'em.
Like libraries.

02:37.905 --> 02:40.673
Okay, I think the fairest way to
do this is to put it to a vote.

02:40.708 --> 02:43.510
Everyone in favor of replacing
the couch raise your hand.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.878
(growls)

02:44.879 --> 02:46.880
Looks like
it's three to two, Bob.

02:46.881 --> 02:48.748
Mom's right, Louise.
The couch is family.

02:48.749 --> 02:50.617
You too, Gene?
Seriously?

02:50.651 --> 02:52.685
You're asking me
to vote against Mom?

02:52.686 --> 02:54.320
I know where
my butter's breaded.

02:54.321 --> 02:55.989
That's my boy.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.023
Come up on the couch with Mama.

02:57.024 --> 02:58.224
Come on.
No!

02:58.225 --> 02:59.859
I think I'm gonna
get some snacks.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.095
Dad, you like snacks,
right? You snack, huh?

03:02.096 --> 03:03.196
Uh, sure, sometimes.

03:03.197 --> 03:04.197
(scoffing)

03:04.231 --> 03:05.311
Why are you pulling me?
Ugh!

03:05.332 --> 03:06.566
What happened out there, Dad?

03:06.567 --> 03:07.834
Where-where were you?

03:07.835 --> 03:09.068
Louise, I tried.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.603
Not hard enough.

03:10.604 --> 03:12.605
Look, we'll get rid
of the couch someday.

03:12.606 --> 03:14.607
How?
Mom's never gonna give it up.

03:14.608 --> 03:16.876
I don't know, maybe
something will happen to it.

03:16.877 --> 03:18.917
Were you serious about the snacks?
'Cause I hid some

03:18.946 --> 03:20.914
fudge pretzels from Gene,
if you're interested.

03:20.915 --> 03:23.550
Back up. What-what do you mean,
something will happen to it?

03:23.551 --> 03:25.785
I don't know. Maybe something
will happen to the couch

03:25.786 --> 03:28.121
that'll make even your mom
want to get rid of it.

03:28.122 --> 03:29.622
Right.

03:29.623 --> 03:32.692
Accidents happen to
couches every day. Sure.

03:32.726 --> 03:34.260
I bet that's true.
Mm-hmm.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.863
Found 'em.
Ugh, Gene got to 'em.

03:36.864 --> 03:39.065
And he left a note.
"Checkmate."

03:40.601 --> 03:42.602
(snoring)

03:47.575 --> 03:49.209
Oops! What am I doing?

03:49.210 --> 03:50.677
(laughing):
Oops, I keep doing it.

03:50.711 --> 03:52.779
Stop.
(sawing continues)

03:52.780 --> 03:54.814
Yay, family TV night!

03:54.815 --> 03:56.816
Why do we call it
family TV night

03:56.817 --> 03:58.551
if we do it every night?

03:58.552 --> 04:00.253
Louise, you sure you don't
want to join your mom

04:00.254 --> 04:01.654
over here on the couch?

04:01.655 --> 04:03.089
Uh, pass.

04:03.090 --> 04:04.624
Fine. More couch for me.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.893
Gene! Tina! Where are you?

04:06.927 --> 04:08.628
Get in on this, babies.

04:08.662 --> 04:10.563
First one on the couch
gets to pick the show.

04:10.564 --> 04:12.265
You drive a hard bargain, woman.

04:12.266 --> 04:14.067
I want something
with adult situations

04:14.068 --> 04:15.301
but I'd settle
for mature themes.

04:15.302 --> 04:17.237
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

04:17.238 --> 04:18.303
Aah!

04:18.305 --> 04:21.107
(distorted screams)

04:21.142 --> 04:23.076
Oh, my God!

04:23.110 --> 04:24.210
Oh, my word!

04:24.245 --> 04:25.478
Oh, my God!
Couch?

04:25.479 --> 04:26.746
Couch, say something!

04:26.747 --> 04:28.448
Give it mouth to mouth!

04:28.449 --> 04:31.017
Well, I guess we're getting
a new couch after all.

04:31.018 --> 04:32.752
Yay!

04:32.753 --> 04:34.120
Anyway. Yay.

04:34.155 --> 04:36.016
(cries)

04:37.698 --> 04:40.231
The couch was too beautiful
for this world.

04:40.232 --> 04:41.933
I'm sorry, Lin.
What's that?

04:41.934 --> 04:44.302
It's instructions for whoever
wants to take it home, Bob.

04:44.337 --> 04:46.404
Oh. That's optimistic.

04:46.405 --> 04:49.140
"Good with children.
Does not fold out into a bed.

04:49.141 --> 04:50.775
Just folds out
because it's broken."

04:50.776 --> 04:52.477
Oh, my God!
What happened here?

04:52.511 --> 04:53.978
The couch is gone, Teddy.

04:53.979 --> 04:56.648
Linda, Linda, Linda.
I am so sorry.

04:56.649 --> 04:58.650
Oh, you know, I...
I-I just keep having

04:58.651 --> 05:00.452
to tell myself it's-it's life.

05:00.453 --> 05:02.020
It is. You know? It's natural.

05:02.021 --> 05:04.689
It is. I got a recliner
that's getting on in years.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.658
Might be time to start
making arrangements.

05:06.692 --> 05:08.793
Come on, people.
Are we gonna stand around all day,

05:08.794 --> 05:10.695
or are we gonna
go get a new couch?

05:10.696 --> 05:11.997
Oh, hold your horses.

05:11.998 --> 05:13.865
I want to be here
if anyone takes it.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.533
Uh, I can keep an eye on it.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.435
I'll be here all day.
Mr. Fischoeder hired me

05:17.436 --> 05:18.837
to do some repairs next door.

05:18.838 --> 05:20.538
The holistic healing
place that moved out

05:20.539 --> 05:22.207
stripped all the copper
out of the walls.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.376
Hmm. Still smells like
incense in there, though.

05:24.377 --> 05:26.711
It's gonna be my most
relaxing day of work ever.

05:26.712 --> 05:29.013
Anyway, I'll see
that the couch goes to a good home.

05:29.014 --> 05:30.348
Aw, thank you, Teddy.

05:30.349 --> 05:31.683
Yeah, thanks, Teddy!
Bye!

05:31.684 --> 05:33.718
Wait, wait, I need
to get a picture.

05:33.719 --> 05:35.020
And a lock of its hair.

05:35.021 --> 05:36.655
Ooh, it's my hair.

05:37.957 --> 05:39.624
Here we are.
The commercial

05:39.625 --> 05:42.027
doesn't do the place justice.
Actually, it does.

05:42.061 --> 05:45.363
(gasps) There she is. Oh.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.532
Welcome to the Sofa Queen
Furniture Outlet.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.034
What can I furnish
you with today?

05:49.035 --> 05:52.103
Uh, is the Sofa Queen here?
My wife is a huge fan.

05:52.138 --> 05:53.838
I'm afraid
she's not, at the moment.

05:53.873 --> 05:55.407
Great. The queen's
not even here?

05:55.408 --> 05:57.142
Oh, what's
the point of anything?

05:57.143 --> 05:59.578
Well, the queen
might not be here,

05:59.579 --> 06:01.479
but maybe you'd like to meet
her loyal servant

06:01.480 --> 06:04.049
and brother-in-law,
the Sofa Jester.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.517
That's me.

06:05.551 --> 06:06.751
(humming a tune)

06:09.555 --> 06:12.090
Well, this is kind of fun.
Right? Lin?

06:12.091 --> 06:14.559
Maybe. Say what you
say in the commercial.

06:14.594 --> 06:18.363
Oh, you mean: "Off Route 9
in Bog Harbor. Boi-oi-oi-oing!"

06:18.397 --> 06:20.732
Again.
Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.200
Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

06:22.234 --> 06:23.368
I'm numb, say it
until I feel something.

06:23.369 --> 06:24.836
Lin...

06:24.870 --> 06:26.438
Off Route 9 in Bog Harbor.

06:26.439 --> 06:27.872
Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

06:27.907 --> 06:29.674
One more time.
Okay, that's okay.

06:29.675 --> 06:31.576
Thanks. Thanks. No, no, no.
We're done. Why? What?

06:31.577 --> 06:32.844
Let's go browse around.

06:32.845 --> 06:34.346
Oh, just browsing?

06:34.347 --> 06:35.614
No, no, we're gonna, I mean,

06:35.615 --> 06:37.055
we're definitely
gonna buy something.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.717
No. It's okay, you're browsing.

06:38.751 --> 06:41.286
Um, uh, no.
We're browsing until we buy.

06:41.287 --> 06:43.254
I'll believe it when I see it.

06:43.289 --> 06:45.390
BOB: Wow.
So many options.

06:45.391 --> 06:47.258
It's like a rave for furniture.

06:47.293 --> 06:49.094
(phone rings) Oh, it's Teddy.

06:49.095 --> 06:51.429
Hi, Teddy.
Hi, Lin. It's Teddy.

06:51.430 --> 06:53.365
Yeah. The couch, the couch!
How's the couch?

06:53.366 --> 06:55.133
Uh, it's okay, it's
here with me now.

06:55.134 --> 06:57.636
One guy showed some interest,
but he had a beard,

06:57.637 --> 06:59.437
so I moved him along.
Ew, a beard.

06:59.438 --> 07:01.740
Shoo, shoo! Some pigeons
just landed on it.

07:01.741 --> 07:03.742
Oh! Get 'em off.
Get 'em off it! Hey, shoo. Shoo.

07:03.743 --> 07:05.377
Aw, come on, get out of here.

07:05.378 --> 07:08.113
Get out of here! Now pigeons.
Pigeons are on it now.

07:08.114 --> 07:09.948
Get off the couch!
No, it was...

07:09.949 --> 07:11.616
(stammers) No, no, no,
I'm yelling at the pigeons.

07:11.617 --> 07:13.051
(stammers) You can't tell
what I'm doing here?

07:13.052 --> 07:14.419
I'm yelling at the pigeons.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.288
Officer, I'm yelling
at the pigeons.

07:16.322 --> 07:19.224
Geez! Mom's got to pull herself
together and move on.

07:19.225 --> 07:20.825
Give her some time.
She's in shock.

07:20.826 --> 07:23.295
What happened to the couch
was such a weird freak accident.

07:23.296 --> 07:25.096
(cackling)

07:25.097 --> 07:26.731
Why are you laughing like that?

07:26.732 --> 07:28.300
Weird freak accident?

07:28.334 --> 07:30.068
Oh, my God.

07:30.069 --> 07:31.603
Yeah.
You did that?

07:31.637 --> 07:33.305
Did I weaken the wood
under the couch

07:33.306 --> 07:34.806
by shaving it down with the file

07:34.807 --> 07:36.308
Mom uses on your toenails?

07:36.309 --> 07:37.909
No. Wink.

07:37.910 --> 07:39.144
I can't believe it.

07:39.178 --> 07:40.445
Well, you should, because

07:40.446 --> 07:41.613
it was your idea, Dad.

07:41.614 --> 07:43.348
What?! No, it wasn't.

07:43.349 --> 07:45.509
(deep voice): Maybe something
will happen to the couch.

07:45.518 --> 07:46.785
I get it...
You said that.

07:46.786 --> 07:48.086
I said... But I didn't mean...

07:48.120 --> 07:49.354
You ordered a hit.

07:49.355 --> 07:50.589
You can't unorder it.

07:50.623 --> 07:52.624
I did not order a hit, Louise.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.693
You didn't want to dirty
your pretty hands,

07:54.694 --> 07:57.028
but you're not gonna hang
me out to dry on this!

07:57.029 --> 07:58.597
Oh, God, here she comes.

07:58.631 --> 08:00.999
(whispering): This isn't over.
It is over,

08:01.033 --> 08:02.767
'cause we're getting a new couch,
'cause I did

08:02.768 --> 08:04.302
what you didn't have
the dumplings to do.

08:04.303 --> 08:05.837
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Lin.

08:05.871 --> 08:08.106
Teddy said somebody in shorts
tried to sit on the couch.

08:08.107 --> 08:09.507
He got there just in time.

08:09.508 --> 08:10.775
That's great.

08:10.776 --> 08:12.877
Well, uh, time to look around.

08:12.878 --> 08:14.579
Look at all the high chairs.

08:14.614 --> 08:16.181
That's the way to live.
Why does anyone

08:16.182 --> 08:17.549
use low chairs anyway?

08:17.550 --> 08:19.851
Yeah! All chairs
should have safety straps

08:19.852 --> 08:21.419
and pictures of bears on them.

08:21.454 --> 08:22.888
I'm gonna ask Mom and Dad
to buy one.

08:22.889 --> 08:24.389
I'm sure I could still fit.

08:24.390 --> 08:27.325
Ha! Good luck, Teenage
Mutant Teenager Legs.

08:27.326 --> 08:29.361
Uh, look who's talking,
Girth Brooks.

08:29.362 --> 08:30.862
I beg your pardon?

08:30.863 --> 08:32.530
I've been a size six for years.

08:32.530 --> 08:35.000
I bet I can still fit in
a high chair and you can't.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.635
What's the winner get?

08:36.669 --> 08:38.970
Hmm.
A week of piggyback rides?

08:38.971 --> 08:39.804
You're on.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.039
(both grunting)

08:41.039 --> 08:42.307
Uh, uh, uh.
Huh?

08:42.308 --> 08:43.842
SALESMAN: Let me guess,
high chair bet?

08:43.842 --> 08:45.377
Uh...
Uh...

08:45.378 --> 08:47.312
I've seen it before
and it doesn't end well.

08:47.313 --> 08:49.581
Sorry, we'll get down.
No, please.

08:49.582 --> 08:51.483
I support your foolhardy wager.

08:51.484 --> 08:53.051
We have a "you break it,
you buy it" policy

08:53.052 --> 08:54.319
and I work on commission.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.854
Wow, what a nice guy.

08:55.855 --> 08:58.723
So this is fun, right?
It's going pretty good.

08:58.758 --> 09:01.226
You think so? We've
looked at 12 couches, Louise.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.728
Your Mom yelled at three of them
and gave one the finger.

09:03.763 --> 09:06.131
Ooh, try this one, Mom.
Take it for a spin.

09:06.165 --> 09:07.866
I'll sit on it
because I'm tired.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.768
This doesn't mean
anything, Mr. Couch.

09:09.769 --> 09:11.069
No funny business.

09:11.103 --> 09:12.671
Well? How does it feel?

09:12.705 --> 09:15.040
Eh. Maybe this
one's not terrible.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.608
Come here, come-come try it. Ha!

09:18.211 --> 09:19.778
Yeah.
It does feel good.

09:19.779 --> 09:21.079
It's all right. It's okay. Hmm.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.547
Yeah, not bad.

09:22.582 --> 09:26.117
Just browsing? Okay.
There you go. Walking away.

09:26.118 --> 09:27.719
All right, coast is clear.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.888
On the count of three,
jump into your high chair.

09:29.889 --> 09:31.223
Is this how babies do it?

09:31.224 --> 09:33.491
Fun babies. One...

09:33.526 --> 09:34.926
This might be a bad idea.

09:34.927 --> 09:36.394
Two...

09:36.395 --> 09:38.063
I take it back,
it's a great idea!

09:38.097 --> 09:39.130
BOB: Gene, Tina.

09:39.131 --> 09:41.199
Ugh.
What does he want?

09:41.234 --> 09:43.101
Oh! Found one you like, huh?

09:43.102 --> 09:44.703
Well, you have excellent taste.

09:44.704 --> 09:47.138
This might be the comfiest
couch in the store.

09:47.139 --> 09:49.541
And I'm not just pushin'
cushions. Boi-oi-oi-oing!

09:49.542 --> 09:51.443
Mm. Maybe no more boings.
Sorry.

09:51.444 --> 09:54.045
Uh, guys,
try out this couch. Nice.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.447
This is some real butt candy.

09:55.448 --> 09:57.249
It doesn't drip
when you sit on it.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.451
We'll take it. No need to wrap
it up, we'll wear it home.

09:59.452 --> 10:00.719
Uh, how much does it cost?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.120
Only $1,399.99.

10:02.121 --> 10:03.421
Kids, get off.
Don't even look at it.

10:03.422 --> 10:04.923
Well, n...
Wait, wait.

10:04.924 --> 10:07.893
I could sell you this
floor model for $499.99.

10:07.927 --> 10:09.628
Wow, now that's a good deal.

10:09.629 --> 10:10.662
Boi-oi-oi...

10:10.663 --> 10:11.830
Sorry.
Thank you.

10:11.831 --> 10:13.431
Mm-hmm. Now there's no returns

10:13.432 --> 10:15.800
and I have to point out
it does have a stain on it.

10:17.470 --> 10:19.404
(all laugh)

10:19.405 --> 10:21.239
We'll teach it what stains are.

10:21.274 --> 10:22.407
So you'll take it?

10:22.441 --> 10:23.975
Mom, are you okay with this?

10:23.976 --> 10:26.912
Sure. Sure, let's do it.
Let's do it.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.580
Terrific! I'll get
the paperwork.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.515
And I'm supposed to do
my little jester dance

10:30.516 --> 10:31.917
when I make a sale.

10:31.918 --> 10:33.318
Uh, we're good. You sure?

10:33.319 --> 10:34.686
It's quite playful.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.655
Fine. Just go ahead,
yeah, yeah, do it.

10:36.656 --> 10:38.456
♪ Yuh, gah-gah gah-gah, goy ♪

10:38.457 --> 10:39.825
♪ Yuh, mm, hey, ma-mommy ♪

10:39.826 --> 10:41.593
♪ Uh-ma, may, Na, byoya, oh! ♪

10:41.594 --> 10:43.461
Linda, this is gonna be good,
right?

10:43.462 --> 10:45.030
Yeah, you're right.

10:45.031 --> 10:47.365
Maybe this was for the best,
you know? Who knows?

10:47.366 --> 10:49.868
See, Dad? It worked.
What?

10:49.869 --> 10:51.803
Hmm? What did yo...? Wait.
What did you say?

10:51.837 --> 10:54.139
I don't know. What-what did
you... what did you say?

10:54.140 --> 10:55.473
The... Wh-What?

10:55.508 --> 10:58.176
You said, "It worked."
What... worked?

10:58.177 --> 10:59.611
What worked?! All right, fine!

10:59.612 --> 11:01.012
We put the couch
out of its misery!

11:01.013 --> 11:02.447
It was dying anyway.

11:02.448 --> 11:03.782
What?! What?! Oh, God.

11:03.783 --> 11:06.117
But look at this!
Pretty new couch, right?

11:06.118 --> 11:07.752
It's so pretty.

11:07.787 --> 11:09.688
Who's "we?" Bob?
Mm. What?

11:09.722 --> 11:12.123
"We put the couch out
of its misery." Who's we?

11:12.158 --> 11:13.658
Wha-What?
I... I'm sorry. I... What?

11:13.693 --> 11:15.994
Were you a part of this?
I would like to say,

11:15.995 --> 11:17.796
I was just getting
fudge pretzels, and...

11:17.830 --> 11:19.231
Checkmate!
I know, Gene.

11:19.232 --> 11:21.666
And I did not mean
in any way to cause...

11:21.701 --> 11:24.402
Monsters!
Monsters!

11:24.403 --> 11:25.670
Linda! Wait!

11:25.671 --> 11:28.373
(Linda mutters, cries, wails)

11:28.374 --> 11:31.042
Okay. Perhaps I can throw in
some pillows and blankets,

11:31.043 --> 11:33.812
'cause it looks like you're
gonna be sleeping on this couch.

11:33.813 --> 11:37.039
Ha! Jesters.
Always gotta be on.

11:38.612 --> 11:41.214
(panting): Linda! Wait!

11:41.215 --> 11:43.149
You and Louise
killed the couch, Bob!

11:43.150 --> 11:44.817
You Kevorkianed it!

11:44.818 --> 11:46.486
Lin? Lin?

11:46.487 --> 11:48.554
Look, I'm not good
at running around things,

11:48.589 --> 11:50.490
so just stop, so we can talk.

11:50.524 --> 11:52.225
Why'd you do it, Louise?

11:52.226 --> 11:54.894
You played God,
and our couch wasn't even religious!

11:54.895 --> 11:57.263
Oh, don't you two couch-huggers
start with me!

11:57.264 --> 11:58.263
Huh.

11:58.265 --> 11:59.866
That lady looks familiar.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.801
GENE (gasping):
It's the Sofa Queen!

12:01.835 --> 12:03.569
The leader
of the Ottoman Empire.

12:03.570 --> 12:07.373
Excuse me. I got to see a sofa
queen about a drama queen.

12:07.408 --> 12:08.408
(knocking on door)

12:08.409 --> 12:09.409
Who is it?

12:09.410 --> 12:11.844
Uh, your Royal Highness?

12:11.879 --> 12:14.380
(fanfare plays)

12:14.415 --> 12:16.983
Oh, my God, it's the Sofa Queen.

12:17.017 --> 12:18.751
Curtsy time!
Oh, right.

12:18.786 --> 12:20.753
(Gene and Tina groaning)

12:20.754 --> 12:22.422
Is that your wife?

12:22.456 --> 12:26.259
(sobbing)

12:26.293 --> 12:27.727
What'd you do to her?

12:27.728 --> 12:29.362
It's... uh, it's a long story.

12:29.363 --> 12:31.698
I thought we were getting
a snack, and then, I...

12:31.699 --> 12:34.434
Okay, okay, okay. Let the woman
with the crown talk her down.

12:34.435 --> 12:36.035
She's really good at this.

12:36.036 --> 12:37.870
She talked me into
marrying her sister.

12:37.871 --> 12:39.772
That's why she's the queen
and you're not.

12:39.773 --> 12:41.241
I know, I know.

12:41.242 --> 12:43.009
You could <i> never</i> be queen.
I know!

12:43.043 --> 12:46.045
(gasping, jabbering, wailing)

12:46.046 --> 12:47.614
(sniffling)

12:47.615 --> 12:50.149
Please don't blow your nose
on my display furniture.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.884
(gasps) It's you.

12:51.919 --> 12:53.620
Your Majesty, it's really you!

12:53.621 --> 12:55.088
And it's really you,

12:55.122 --> 12:57.257
lady crying
in the middle of a store.

12:57.258 --> 12:59.626
Come on, make some room. (cries)

12:59.627 --> 13:02.095
Oh, I don't like this.
We sell this?

13:02.096 --> 13:03.596
Did you bring this?

13:03.597 --> 13:05.198
I don't think so.

13:05.232 --> 13:06.766
Not much we can do here.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.234
Yeah, Sofa Queen's got this.

13:08.235 --> 13:10.470
To the high chairs?
To the high chairs.

13:10.504 --> 13:12.272
(whispering):
To the high chairs!

13:12.306 --> 13:14.440
They did <i> what?!</i>
I know, right?

13:14.441 --> 13:16.643
You don't do that to
a woman's couch!

13:16.644 --> 13:18.444
The couch I raised my babies on!

13:18.445 --> 13:19.879
Horrible! Hey, Bob!

13:19.914 --> 13:20.947
Oh, no.

13:20.948 --> 13:22.315
Uh, yes, Your Majesty?

13:22.349 --> 13:23.416
What's wrong with you?

13:23.450 --> 13:24.651
I didn't, um...

13:24.652 --> 13:25.919
I wasn't thinking.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.253
It's complicated 'cause I...

13:27.288 --> 13:28.922
Don't touch that!
Sorry.

13:28.923 --> 13:30.290
I got to say,

13:30.291 --> 13:31.691
that sounds like
a special couch.

13:31.692 --> 13:33.126
You got any pictures?

13:33.127 --> 13:34.460
Yeah, I took one
this morning... here.

13:34.461 --> 13:35.662
Look, there you go. Mm.

13:35.663 --> 13:38.364
Oh, that's, uh...
Yeah.

13:38.365 --> 13:40.099
Uh... Hmm.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.501
Good couch, right?

13:41.502 --> 13:43.036
It's got character.

13:43.037 --> 13:45.438
Yeah, it's got character
splattered all over it.

13:45.439 --> 13:48.942
Linda, that's what we call
in the industry a nasty couch.

13:48.943 --> 13:51.611
Oh. Right. I gue...
I gue... I guess it's bad.

13:51.612 --> 13:53.012
I guess it's bad.
(chuckles)

13:53.013 --> 13:54.347
Okay, it's bad.

13:54.381 --> 13:56.115
Linda, you're gonna think

13:56.116 --> 13:58.451
I'm only trying to sell you
a new couch, and I am.

13:58.452 --> 13:59.853
I'm the Sofa Queen.

13:59.854 --> 14:01.588
But I think you know
what you gotta do.

14:01.622 --> 14:03.056
What?
You know.

14:03.057 --> 14:04.457
I do?
Yes.

14:04.458 --> 14:05.892
New couch?
New couch.

14:05.893 --> 14:07.861
I love you.
I know.

14:07.862 --> 14:09.829
Give me huggies!
Too much.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.498
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

14:11.499 --> 14:13.666
Don't touch the queen.
Sor-Sorry. Sorry.

14:13.701 --> 14:15.869
So it's really happening...
we're getting a new couch.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.037
It is, and you are welcome.

14:18.038 --> 14:19.906
We're actually
replacing Old Stinko.

14:19.907 --> 14:21.374
Yup.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.809
John Stain-mos.

14:22.810 --> 14:23.843
Mm-hmm.

14:23.844 --> 14:25.879
Old... Fartcatcher.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.313
Okay, Dad, take it easy.

14:27.314 --> 14:28.715
Back off a little.

14:28.716 --> 14:30.183
Sorry, I-I got on a roll there.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.651
(both yelling)

14:31.652 --> 14:33.052
Get it off!
Get it off!

14:33.053 --> 14:35.688
Why did we do this?!
It pinches! It pinches!

14:35.689 --> 14:37.724
This can't be safe for babies!
(groaning)

14:37.725 --> 14:39.192
(Tina and Gene groaning) Aah!

14:39.193 --> 14:40.727
Why am I doing this?!

14:40.728 --> 14:42.762
I knew I wouldn't fit.
What came over me?!

14:42.763 --> 14:45.131
It's intoxicating!
Aah!

14:45.166 --> 14:46.900
LINDA:
<i>Come on, everybody eat faster</i>

14:46.934 --> 14:48.668
so we can start TV night
on the new couch!

14:48.669 --> 14:50.270
Where are the napkins?

14:50.271 --> 14:51.571
Do you mean the paper
towel roll?

14:51.572 --> 14:52.839
Yeah.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.074
This guy hangs out with a queen.

14:54.075 --> 14:55.942
Now he's using napkins.

14:55.943 --> 14:58.578
(sighs) Someone kicked
the paper towel roll down the hall.

14:58.579 --> 15:00.747
Again. Louise, did you do that?

15:00.748 --> 15:02.715
Kick the paper towel roll?
Of course.

15:02.716 --> 15:04.384
It's a paper towel roll.

15:04.385 --> 15:06.286
Right. Well, would
you get it, please?

15:06.287 --> 15:07.687
Ugh! Fine!

15:10.758 --> 15:12.826
Oh. Huh.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.228
Hi. Well, this is awkward.

15:15.262 --> 15:18.231
Just... not gonna
look out there again.

15:18.232 --> 15:19.799
Oh, God, I looked.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.401
I see you, okay?!

15:21.435 --> 15:23.069
I know
what you're trying to pull,

15:23.070 --> 15:24.437
looking all pathetic
on the curb.

15:24.472 --> 15:25.972
But it's not gonna work.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.574
I'll just close my eyes.

15:27.608 --> 15:28.875
(laughs)

15:28.909 --> 15:30.543
Okay, shouldn't have
closed my eyes.

15:30.544 --> 15:32.212
Louise,
I need a paper towel, please.

15:32.213 --> 15:34.214
Gene motorboated
his pasta again.

15:34.215 --> 15:36.249
Oh.
Mm-hmm. Old couch.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.766
Yup. It's gonna be fine, right?

15:38.786 --> 15:40.386
Are you kidding?
It's gonna be great!

15:40.421 --> 15:42.822
It's got a rich, full
life ahead of it.

15:42.823 --> 15:44.290
Ooh!
Ooh!

15:44.325 --> 15:45.759
It-It's gonna shake that off.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.993
Yeah, that wasn't... that sad.

15:46.994 --> 15:48.061
No.

15:48.095 --> 15:49.129
There you are!

15:49.130 --> 15:50.563
You missed the part of dinner

15:50.564 --> 15:51.965
where we all put our plates
in the sink

15:51.966 --> 15:53.600
and pretend
somebody's gonna do the dishes.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.201
All right, new couch, here we come!
So this is

15:55.236 --> 15:56.970
what it feels like
to sit upright.

15:56.971 --> 15:58.405
It's nice.
The room looks different.

15:58.439 --> 15:59.973
Oh, here comes another car.

15:59.974 --> 16:01.608
Is it gonna...? Oh, God.
(water splashing)

16:01.609 --> 16:03.176
It hit the puddle.

16:03.177 --> 16:04.611
Looked like he went out
of his way to hit it.

16:04.612 --> 16:06.079
What am I being so sappy about?

16:06.080 --> 16:07.580
Sure I liked making couch forts,

16:07.581 --> 16:09.182
but I can make forts
with the new couch.

16:09.183 --> 16:10.950
Uh, actually, the cushions
don't come off.

16:10.951 --> 16:13.353
Oh. Okay,
but the old couch <i> is</i> scruffy.

16:13.354 --> 16:14.988
I mean... (scoffs)

16:14.989 --> 16:17.090
we don't keep scruffy things
in this house, right?

16:17.091 --> 16:19.092
Are you serious?
Oh, right.

16:19.093 --> 16:21.027
Yeah.
It's like Scruff City.

16:24.732 --> 16:25.965
Son of a bitch.

16:25.966 --> 16:27.267
We gotta go get it.

16:27.301 --> 16:28.501
Hmm. Sounds like you just said,

16:28.502 --> 16:29.636
"We've gotta go get it."

16:29.637 --> 16:31.071
Like, right now.

16:31.105 --> 16:32.639
What are you guys
talkin' about over there?

16:32.640 --> 16:34.107
We gotta get the old couch back.

16:34.141 --> 16:35.308
Oh, thank God.

16:35.309 --> 16:36.976
I don't know
who I am on this couch.

16:36.977 --> 16:39.312
Yeah! I don't <i> like</i>
who I am on this couch.

16:39.313 --> 16:41.114
What?! Oh, no, no, no!

16:41.115 --> 16:44.017
I wanted to keep the old couch,
but you told me I was nuts!

16:44.018 --> 16:46.653
So we went through all this,
and now you think it isn't nuts?

16:46.687 --> 16:48.354
It is pretty nuts, you guys.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.957
I know, okay?
It's just, how can you not look

16:50.958 --> 16:53.993
at that stinky old couch out
there and not want it inside?

16:54.028 --> 16:56.229
It's... it's one of us.

16:56.263 --> 16:58.465
Yeah! Old couch came out of Mom!

16:58.466 --> 17:01.000
So, you <i> do</i> like the old couch?

17:01.035 --> 17:02.802
No! It's a gross,

17:02.837 --> 17:05.839
lumpy, dumpy
monster, and... aah!

17:05.839 --> 17:07.607
Let's just go get it, okay?

17:07.641 --> 17:09.041
Uh... all right.

17:09.042 --> 17:10.410
Let's go!
Let's do it!

17:11.512 --> 17:12.651
Oh, my God, it's gone!

17:13.814 --> 17:15.214
LINDA, GENE, TINA and LOUISE:
What?!

17:16.916 --> 17:19.219
Good news! Someone
picked up the couch!

17:19.252 --> 17:21.654
No! No! No!

17:21.689 --> 17:25.039
You guys react weird to good news.
GENE: Yes!

17:25.634 --> 17:29.021
Where the freak is our couch?!
It was here just a second ago.

17:29.022 --> 17:31.414
Yeah, these guys came and got it.
I would've told you,

17:31.448 --> 17:33.883
but I didn't want to interrupt
your time with the new couch.

17:33.884 --> 17:35.685
Those first moments
of bonding are so important.

17:35.719 --> 17:37.153
Who was it?
Some teenage boys.

17:37.154 --> 17:38.387
They were in a band.

17:38.388 --> 17:39.855
Exchange me for the couch.

17:39.856 --> 17:40.856
I'm willing to make
that sacrifice.

17:40.857 --> 17:42.725
No, Tina.
A band?!

17:42.726 --> 17:44.160
Why did they want our couch?

17:44.161 --> 17:45.628
Probably to sit on.
Lazy band.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.096
They invited me to their show.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.631
It's next Friday
at the Ear Drum.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.666
I haven't been
to a rock show in a while.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.535
What do I wear? Are sleeveless
shirts still cool?

17:52.536 --> 17:54.136
We've got to go to the Ear Drum

17:54.137 --> 17:55.838
and see if anyone knows
how to find these guys.

17:55.839 --> 17:58.174
Yeah. Or we could
just go back upstairs

17:58.175 --> 17:59.876
and think about all the good
times we had with the...

17:59.877 --> 18:01.510
Come on, we're going!
Let's go! Mm-hmm.

18:01.511 --> 18:03.879
Yeah, scope it out.
Pay attention to the shirts.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.349
Sleeves? No sleeves?
Let me know!

18:07.684 --> 18:08.918
It's four teenage boys.

18:08.919 --> 18:10.152
They're playing here
next Friday.

18:10.153 --> 18:11.520
Oh, I know those guys.

18:11.555 --> 18:13.222
Yeah, w-what do they call
themselves now?

18:13.223 --> 18:14.690
They're-they're always
changing their name.

18:14.691 --> 18:16.392
Uh, used to be
the Melon Smashers.

18:16.393 --> 18:17.760
Then they were
the Vase Breakers.

18:17.761 --> 18:19.362
Now they're called, um...

18:19.363 --> 18:20.796
oh, yeah, yeah,
the Couch Burners.

18:20.831 --> 18:22.231
Aah! Aah! Aah!

18:22.232 --> 18:24.033
Oh, God.
The Couch Burners?

18:24.034 --> 18:26.736
Those idiots are gonna burn
our couch and put it on their flyer!

18:26.770 --> 18:28.437
Oh, they got your couch, huh?

18:28.438 --> 18:30.072
Well, why'd you give
your couch to the Couch Burners?

18:30.107 --> 18:31.674
Look: on both flyers,

18:31.675 --> 18:33.342
they're standing
on the railroad tracks.

18:33.343 --> 18:34.911
BOB: Hey, that's
the old train depot.

18:34.945 --> 18:36.546
<i>You're</i> an old train depot!

18:36.547 --> 18:38.848
Come on, people.
We got a couch to save.

18:38.849 --> 18:40.516
(lighter clicks open)

18:40.517 --> 18:42.051
After we get the shot
we're gonna use,

18:42.052 --> 18:43.619
we should get one silly one,
just for sillies.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.021
Oh, sure, yeah.

18:45.055 --> 18:46.322
There they are!

18:46.356 --> 18:47.723
Bunch of sick sofa psychos!

18:47.724 --> 18:49.125
And there's the couch!

18:49.126 --> 18:50.860
Get 'em, Dad!
Run, Bobby!

18:50.861 --> 18:53.029
Why do I have to...?
Oh, fine.

18:53.063 --> 18:55.464
(wheezing)

18:56.700 --> 18:58.634
Excuse me! Hey!

18:58.635 --> 19:00.403
Dude, are you okay?

19:00.404 --> 19:01.871
Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

19:01.905 --> 19:04.206
Uh, are you the, uh,
Couch Burners?

19:04.241 --> 19:05.942
Oh, my God,
have you heard of us?

19:05.976 --> 19:08.711
Uh, I'm really sorry to do this,
but we need that couch back.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.613
It's ours, and you're
<i>not</i> gonna burn it!

19:10.647 --> 19:12.582
We found this thing
on the street.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.817
Finders, keepers.
Keepers, burners.

19:14.818 --> 19:17.053
It's gonna be immortalized
on our new flyer, so...

19:17.054 --> 19:18.688
you're welcome.
Ha.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.090
Listen, the couch has been
in the family a long time.

19:21.091 --> 19:22.491
Please give it back to us.

19:22.492 --> 19:24.093
Sir, I get it.
You love the couch.

19:24.094 --> 19:26.095
Yes, we do.

19:26.096 --> 19:28.497
But if you love something,
set it on fire.

19:28.498 --> 19:30.099
Those are good lyrics, man.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.567
I know, right?

19:31.602 --> 19:33.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! No!

19:33.236 --> 19:35.605
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:35.606 --> 19:37.740
What if we could get you
a different couch to burn, huh?

19:37.741 --> 19:39.508
Yeah, yeah!
A buh-buh better couch!

19:39.509 --> 19:43.112
Linda, you're not talking
about the new couch? Why not?

19:43.113 --> 19:44.513
Yeah, Dad, why not?

19:44.514 --> 19:46.249
'Cause it cost $499.99.

19:46.283 --> 19:47.917
It's a floor model.
We can't return it!

19:47.918 --> 19:49.819
Yeah, Bob. What did you think
we were gonna do with it

19:49.820 --> 19:51.687
when we took the old one back?

19:51.688 --> 19:54.423
I was imagining we'd prop
one couch up on the other one,

19:54.424 --> 19:56.292
so it looked
like they were making love.

19:56.293 --> 19:57.727
Aw.
Mmm!

19:57.761 --> 19:59.662
Well, we could sell it.

19:59.663 --> 20:02.031
Damn it, Dad! Do you want
the old couch back or don't you?!

20:02.032 --> 20:03.466
(sighs) Okay, fine.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.468
Wait, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on a second.

20:05.469 --> 20:07.169
We don't know anything
about this new couch.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.938
Yeah!
What's going on there?

20:08.972 --> 20:10.439
Well, what do you need to know?

20:10.474 --> 20:12.742
Well, like, can you burn it?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.810
Um, yeah, you can.

20:14.845 --> 20:16.679
Okay, we'll take it!

20:16.680 --> 20:17.813
(flames crackling,
camera shutter clicks)

20:17.814 --> 20:18.814
All right, guys, one more.

20:18.815 --> 20:19.815
(camera shutter clicks)

20:19.816 --> 20:20.816
No, you had your eyes closed

20:20.817 --> 20:22.518
again, so... one more.

20:22.553 --> 20:25.521
Here we go. All right,
eyes are still closed, so...

20:25.555 --> 20:27.189
I... Still? Yeah, just open them.
You had them closed.

20:27.190 --> 20:28.858
I so feel like my eyes are open.

20:28.859 --> 20:30.693
Open your eyes and let me take this.
All right.

20:30.694 --> 20:32.795
(camera shutter clicks)
All of you, closed.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.031
Okay, we both... Guys, we got to
take it while it's still burning.

20:35.065 --> 20:37.533
If you put one foot in front of
the other, you'll look thinner.

20:37.534 --> 20:39.869
Yeah, that's perfect.

20:39.903 --> 20:42.505
BOB: Ugh. We got the couch back,
Mom. We did it.

20:42.506 --> 20:45.141
Yup. Who knows
a good upholsterer? Anyone?

20:45.142 --> 20:46.709
I do know a good upholsterer.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.477
He's on Cape Cod!

20:48.478 --> 20:50.480
Quick fort while we're waiting
for new couch to burn?

20:50.481 --> 20:53.549
Sure! Dibs on the spot
that smells like guacamole!
