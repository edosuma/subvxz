00:01.002 --> 00:02.458
(Audrey): Previously on Haven...

00:04.589 --> 00:06.295
- Hello, Dove.
- Croatoan.

00:06.424 --> 00:09.712
- Not Dad?
Clearly we have a lot of catching up to do.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.631
- What they did to you,
turning you into the Barn's controller...

00:12.763 --> 00:14.219
Could you do it to me?

00:14.348 --> 00:18.261
- Vince! What have you done?
- What I had to.

00:19.437 --> 00:22.929
- It's a Holloway Trouble,
where a building merges with a person.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.896
(phone rings)
Are you trying to talk to me?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.815
It's Laverne.

00:27.570 --> 00:31.313
- Who am I talking to right now? Duke?
- No.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.861
This is what I am.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.826
- Croatoan's inside your head.
You can force him out.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.910
Don't let him control you.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.113
- Daddy?

00:45.129 --> 00:46.630
- I need to teach you a lesson.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.041
(crack)
(screams)

00:49.383 --> 00:52.090
- You can control the Troubles
that you take from people?

00:52.220 --> 00:55.678
- They're gifts, and in the right hands,
they can accomplish anything.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.137
| created you.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.843
- All the times
that you asked me to kill for you,

01:01.979 --> 01:05.813
look what I have become,
what you turned me into.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.359
- I got snacks from the vending machine.

01:14.492 --> 01:18.405
- Please tell me you got the P3 unstuck
and that's a Baby Ruth in your hand.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.118
(groans)

01:22.833 --> 01:23.868
- Sorry.
- Ah.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.207
- Granola.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.703
Laverne controls the vending machine now.
She only dispenses the healthy stuff.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.463
A little healthy wouldn't hurt.

01:33.970 --> 01:34.925
How you holding up?

01:35.888 --> 01:39.506
You must be exhausted.
- Croatoan locked me in a child's room

01:39.642 --> 01:44.557
and said he was going to help
my friends, make them happy.

01:44.689 --> 01:47.101
It was scarier than a flat-out threat.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.689
- Sounds terrifying.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.901
I'm sorry.
- He was different than I expected.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.315
So much hurt.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.439
He really thinks that he's
doing the right thing.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.284
- By getting you to help him Trouble people.
- It's more than that.

02:00.413 --> 02:02.404
He's a father that wants his daughter back.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.246
- But you are not his daughter.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.329
Mara was. She's dead.

02:07.461 --> 02:12.296
- But when he looks at me, he sees her.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.594
- Which is why we need
to get this thing fixed,

02:18.723 --> 02:22.386
get that Barn built,
send that monster back to the Void.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.474
- Has Vince come up with anything yet?

02:25.855 --> 02:27.265
- No, not yet.

02:27.898 --> 02:31.356
Dwight's working on it with him.
He's got him stashed awayjust in case...

02:31.777 --> 02:33.313
- In case Duke comes after him.

02:33.446 --> 02:35.562
Has anybody seen him
since he took the census?

02:35.698 --> 02:38.189
- No.
- lf Croatoan gets those Troubles,

02:38.326 --> 02:41.193
he's gonna use them against us.
- He's not gonna get the chance.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.411
We're gonna get Duke back.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.579
(dramatic music)

03:06.729 --> 03:07.764
(metallic clatter)

03:12.109 --> 03:15.351
(breathing heavily)

03:18.741 --> 03:20.106
- Victor Kirby.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.075
I knew your aunt.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.199
She could see the future too.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.621
Anyone she touched...

03:32.713 --> 03:36.376
Vanessa knew exactly
how they were going to die.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.299
- What do you want?

03:38.803 --> 03:40.794
- Your Trouble.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.967
- But why?
lt's horrible.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.590
- Not for Croatoan.

03:45.935 --> 03:49.427
He can turn it into a power,

03:49.563 --> 03:52.600
use it to show his daughter

03:52.733 --> 03:56.021
how amazing the future can be

03:56.153 --> 03:58.530
if she joins him.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.647
- Please don't.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.117
- You look so worried, Kirby.

04:05.246 --> 04:08.079
But don't you know what's going to happen?

04:08.207 --> 04:12.166
Haven't you seen
how you're going to meet your end?

04:12.294 --> 04:17.209
- I've tried, but I can only see
how other people die, not me.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.753
- If you had seen it,

04:20.344 --> 04:22.801
it would've looked a lot like this.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.133
(groans)

04:32.148 --> 04:34.639
- I know how it ends for you, Crocker.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.515
I can see it.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.984
Just like Vanessa did.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.116
- I'm not that man anymore.

04:53.669 --> 04:56.126
(theme music)

05:27.995 --> 05:31.032
- Vince says there's nothing in his
new programming to fix the Aether core.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.872
- l was afraid of that.
How's he doing otherwise?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.617
- He says he feels mostly the same,
but it's gotta be weird.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.120
- Being turned into an
otherworldly crystal, yeah.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.294
I'd feel better if I at least knew
where you hid it.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.003
- You can trust me, Nathan.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.091
- Of course I can.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.226
You keep working with Vince.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.310
We'll try to figure out
a way to fix the core on our end.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.850
- I'll call you if we manage
to come up with something.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.440
- Why don't you want
to tell them about Lizzie?

06:04.365 --> 06:06.151
Because you're afraid they'll take her?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.194
- I need to know what she is.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.445
- An Aether creature maybe,
like the ones William made?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.863
Or a product of a Trouble?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.244
A resurrection Trouble.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.790
You don't think
she could actually be Lizzie?

06:20.172 --> 06:22.629
- No. My daughter's dead.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.797
lt's Duke. He's out there.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.932
- Daddy, what's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Everything's fine.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.806
- Why is he just standing there?
What's he waiting for?

06:39.942 --> 06:42.183
- Okay, I want you to take
Lizzie to the back stairs.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.356
lf Duke comes in, I want you to both run.
- But what about you?

06:45.489 --> 06:47.605
- I'll buy you some time.
Couple of minutes.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.325
- You can't confront him.
- I can't let him get a hold of you.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.452
He might be here for Lizzie.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.575
Please.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.800
Lizzie, I need you to go
with Uncle Vince, okay?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.923
- No, I want to stay here with you.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.223
- Honey, it's a game.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.597
You and Vince go hide
and see how long it takes for me to find you.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.019
- Oh, I love hide and seek.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.776
Okay, you count down from 100,
and we'll hide.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.361
- Come on. I know a good hiding spot.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.289
- 100, 99...

07:39.918 --> 07:41.533
98...

07:42.379 --> 07:43.960
97...

07:48.761 --> 07:52.845
- Oh, he was stabbed in the chest.
It looks like Duke's work, all right.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.181
- Poor Victor. He didn't stand a chance.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.802
- Anyway, I gotta go.
lntern's watching baby Aaron,

07:59.938 --> 08:02.475
and she keeps giving him apple juice.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.441
You think Croatoan's tough,
try an infant on a sugar high.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.104
- Vickie.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.449
Vickie still has her sketching Trouble.

08:14.578 --> 08:18.321
So maybe if she can draw the Aether core,

08:19.124 --> 08:20.375
she can put it back together.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.617
She can make it whole again.
- It's worth a shot.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.493
I'll have her meet us at the station.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.582
- Croatoan.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.923
(gunfire)

08:45.317 --> 08:46.352
- You must be Nathan.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.688
An "ask questions later" kind of guy.

08:48.821 --> 08:50.607
I like you already.
- You bastard...

08:50.739 --> 08:54.072
- Nathan, the Troubles he holds...
We can't hurt him.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.567
- Smart, pragmatic.

08:56.704 --> 08:57.910
That's my girl.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.574
And right as usual.

08:59.707 --> 09:04.417
Strike me, and your
internal organs liquefy.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.877
A Trouble I gathered from your census.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.589
- Why did Duke kill Kirby?
To take his Trouble?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.713
- Collecting Troubles
was what I designed him to do.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.588
- So you could take them with you,
use them for your revenge?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.430
- No, you're going to design those Troubles.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.926
Oh, these are for my personal use.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.929
- So what, you're just here
to make sure Duke stays on schedule?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.851
- No, no, Duke's fine.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.854
I'm here to talk to you, Nathan.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.069
You're a lucky man.

09:33.198 --> 09:37.817
From my conversations with my daughter,

09:37.953 --> 09:41.161
I can tell she loves you very much.
She'll do anything to make you happy.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.202
And that's very hard to find.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.288
- Leave Nathan alone.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.254
- As I promised you, I'm here to help him.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.211
Nathan,

09:54.678 --> 09:59.547
what if I could offer you
a new life far from here,

10:00.517 --> 10:04.180
the life you've always wanted
with the woman you love?

10:07.941 --> 10:08.976
Audrey.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.355
There she is, Nathan.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.366
Everything you've ever wanted.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.537
And I'm giving her to you.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.631
- You want to give me a copy of Audrey?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.296
- One that loves you with all her heart.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.804
I'll take you both outside the shroud,

10:40.933 --> 10:43.845
set you up in a new life
far away from here.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.639
Neither one of you will remember Haven.

10:46.772 --> 10:50.390
Nathan, I'm offering you a fresh start.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.145
- Why?
Why would you do this?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.488
- Oh, Dove,

10:59.409 --> 11:02.776
what is coming...

11:04.790 --> 11:07.406
It'll be such a wonderful time for us.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.579
You don't have to worry about Nathan.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.953
This way you know he's taken care of,
that he's happy.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.797
- You think that copy can make me happy?

11:16.385 --> 11:18.751
- I assure you you will never know

11:19.721 --> 11:21.461
or be able to tell the difference.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.882
- If she's so perfect,
why don't you just keep her for yourself?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.181
- I said you would never know the difference.
l'm her father. I would know.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.305
- You think I would abandon Audrey
for some illusion?

11:32.776 --> 11:38.146
I belong here in Haven,
with Audrey, fighting you.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.429
- What do you want, Duke?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.557
- Question is, what do you want, Dwight?

12:14.693 --> 12:17.605
- Right now I want to kill you
for murdering my friends

12:17.738 --> 12:18.944
and betraying us to Croatoan.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.563
- I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.275
Do you have a second choice,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.323
like, perhaps, raising your daughter?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.371
- My daughter's dead.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.206
- No. She's right in there.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.043
- That's not Lizzie.
- Are you sure?

12:35.172 --> 12:38.539
Croatoan used a very special Trouble
to bring her back.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.666
He must really like you.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.669
- Yeah. Why did he send you here, Duke?
What does Croatoan want?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.421
- The controller crystal.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.801
- What makes him think l have it?
- He knows that you have it.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.811
- The crystal isn't here.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.226
- Then go and get it.

12:55.359 --> 12:59.523
Deliver it to Croatoan,
and he will let you keep Lizzie.

12:59.655 --> 13:03.443
- I think you know me better than that, Duke.
- Then he will come for her.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.034
Or maybe he'll just send me.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.711
- Where's Lizzie?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.922
- Upstairs.
What did Duke want?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.760
- He said Lizzie's some kind
of gift from Croatoan,

13:25.889 --> 13:27.095
an example of his power.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.760
- He's going to let you keep her?

13:28.892 --> 13:31.554
(sighs)
I'm not even sure she is a her.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.181
Come on, Vince,
she can't really be my daughter.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.555
- | see the way you look at her, Dwight.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.683
It's not just that child.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.561
A part of you
has been brought back to life here.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.495
- Losing Lizzie...

13:54.251 --> 13:57.084
watching those bullets
tear into her, it was like dying.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.416
For a long time, I wanted to die.

14:02.426 --> 14:07.011
Thought about ending it, a lot.
- I know.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.470
l was afraid for you.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.726
(sighs)

14:13.770 --> 14:15.931
- It took so long to crawl out of that hole.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.938
I can't go through that again.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.571
- I know.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.026
And to this day, | feel responsible.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.864
I led the Guard.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.945
They were my men who shot Lizzie.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.035
I couldn't make it right back then.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.535
I can never make it right.

14:41.965 --> 14:45.457
How terribly ironic if Croatoan can.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.474
- I can't believe I let you involve
Intern in all of this.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.225
What if Croatoan finds out
she's helping you and sends Duke after her?

15:02.360 --> 15:05.648
- If my Trouble can fix it,
you know I have to try, Gloria.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.567
- It doesn't mean I have to like it.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.280
- It's really good, Vickie.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.442
- When I'm done, if we fold it here,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.907
the crack in the core should close.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.201
- And then we will give it to Vince,

15:17.626 --> 15:19.491
and finally we can build a new Barn.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.622
- Get rid of Croatoan.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.912
(chuckles)
Rock, paper, scissors.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.961
Stick with the paper, kid.
They never see it coming.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.176
- Got a few more security cameras going.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.381
Perimeter looks good.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.181
- We... I think we might need
to talk about something.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.432
-Ah.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.817
I'm not leaving you.

15:46.196 --> 15:50.986
- Croatoan's offer has to be a little...
tempting.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.030
- You're asking me
if I want all this to be over,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.787
live behind some white picket fence,

15:57.916 --> 16:00.578
adopt a shelter dog?
(scoffs)

16:01.128 --> 16:02.459
Of course I do.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.503
But I want that
with the real Audrey Parker,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.839
not some copy.

16:07.968 --> 16:11.131
- You wouldn't even remember
that she wasn't real.

16:13.223 --> 16:18.308
How can I claim to love you as much as I do
if I don't at least give you that chance?

16:19.104 --> 16:22.688
- Your asking me to consider this is exactly

16:22.816 --> 16:27.810
the reason why I never, never could.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.151
Vickie's almost done with the core.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.323
We are gonna beat Croatoan, save Duke,

16:37.455 --> 16:39.286
and get our lives back.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.498
- Yeah.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.708
(phone beeps)

16:43.837 --> 16:46.044
Laverne, do you have something?

16:51.761 --> 16:52.841
Duke.

17:02.606 --> 17:06.019
- Come out, come out,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.943
wherever you are.

17:15.911 --> 17:19.403
Where did they run to, Laverne?

17:22.334 --> 17:23.574
(chuckles)

17:28.006 --> 17:30.998
You can play all the games you want.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.884
I'm getting what I came for.

17:41.728 --> 17:47.223
Vickie, you have been very, very busy.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.243
Still warm, Nathan.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.373
- Okay, what do we do now?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.117
- Well, we can't stay here.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.040
- Why? We're 3 feet above the lava.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.084
- We need to rescue the princess
before the dragon gets her.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.799
- I thought you were the princess.
- No, silly, I'm Lizzie the Lionhearted,

18:14.928 --> 18:17.260
and you're Dwight the Dauntless.
It's how we always play.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.095
- Right. Right. Okay.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.839
Well, we need some stepping stones.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.765
- Here goes nothing.
- Hang on.

18:28.066 --> 18:31.058
(both laugh)
We made it. Did we rescue the princess?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.354
- Yes, but you melted your feet.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.239
- Oh.
(exhales)

18:35.365 --> 18:36.571
Darn.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.034
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty.
- Dad, we played last week.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.699
- Lizzie...

18:46.626 --> 18:47.786
That was a lot of fun.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.167
There's some milk and cookies
in the kitchen.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.037
I'd say we deserve them.
(laughs)

18:56.219 --> 18:58.801
- She has no idea she died?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.966
- No, but she remembers everything else.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.090
She even called herself
Lizzie the Lionhearted.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.136
How could she know that?

19:04.269 --> 19:06.851
- Have you noticed anything
different about her?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.312
- Not yet. But the cookies...
(tapping)

19:09.441 --> 19:11.432
The cookies are a test.
- A test?

19:11.568 --> 19:13.854
- It's been a thing for her
since her mother left.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.943
l stocked that kitchen
with ten types of cookies.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.233
If that's my daughter,
she'll bring out two types,

19:18.366 --> 19:21.108
her favorite and her least favorite,
arranged on the plate like a flower.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.484
- Oh.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.245
- Milk and cookies, Mr. Teagues.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.167
(laughs)
- What a polite young lady.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.836
Thank you, Lizzie.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.020
- How's it going, Vickie?

19:51.149 --> 19:53.936
- Almost there.
- Hurry. Laverne may have been able

19:54.069 --> 19:56.981
to move this wall to hide us,
but Duke won't be fooled for long.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.068
- Or fooled at all.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.440
Duke knows this place
like the back of his hand, poor kid.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.445
- Finished.

20:03.912 --> 20:06.073
- Good.
So if you fold it,

20:06.206 --> 20:08.242
the core should be able
to fuse together, right?

20:10.335 --> 20:11.290
Nathan.
- Duke.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.037
Stop.
Don't make me shoot.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.128
Duke.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.172
Go.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.502
(grunts)

20:21.638 --> 20:23.174
(Audrey): We have to get the core fixed.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.140
Laverne, slow him down.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.727
(gaSDS)

20:32.565 --> 20:34.521
(Duke): I want that drawing, Vickie.
-Jesus.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.859
Duke, please. This isn't you.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.980
- Oh, this is me, just with improvements.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.529
- The Duke I know stands up
to bullies like Croatoan.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.322
You don't want to hurt Vickie.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.742
- I should've killed you
when you were a statue.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.532
(grunts)

20:52.669 --> 20:54.159
(Nathan): Go.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.796
The Aether core.
- Got it.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.503
- No!

20:59.426 --> 21:00.916
You don't.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.011
Ah...

21:08.184 --> 21:09.173
- No...

21:28.872 --> 21:30.954
- | always liked your Trouble, Vickie.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.704
I can't wait to try it out.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.847
Oh, is it your turn now?

21:49.976 --> 21:52.968
You're going to tell me
how much I mean to you?

21:53.104 --> 21:55.766
How we're family?
- No.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.230
- No?

21:58.735 --> 22:02.102
Hundreds and hundreds
of your little speeches...

22:02.238 --> 22:06.026
"Trouble whispering"
all of your little lambs.

22:06.159 --> 22:11.119
You must have something special
in your bag of trick for me.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.704
- I'm not going to tell you
what you already know,

22:13.833 --> 22:15.949
that what you're doing is wrong.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.462
I'm not going to beg for our lives, Duke.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.500
- Don't be so melodramatic.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.670
Croatoan wants you alive.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.464
Nathan too, for now.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.214
As long as the old lady
doesn't get in my way,

22:31.351 --> 22:35.811
I will take the artiste and go.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.180
(sobs)

22:38.775 --> 22:41.733
- I will not let you kill Vickie.
- Oh, I see.

22:41.861 --> 22:46.104
You'll only let me kill
when it serves your purpose.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.236
Well, I don't work for you anymore.

22:49.369 --> 22:53.829
- You never worked for us.
- No, Duke's right.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.697
We used you.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.785
I... used you.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.746
When we found out
about the Crocker family curse,

23:02.882 --> 23:04.258
about what it could do,

23:04.384 --> 23:08.753
| used that as a tool to stop the Troubles
because that's what I was sent here to do.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.880
But I didn't think about how much
it was going to hurt you,

23:12.016 --> 23:14.849
how killing all of those people, how...

23:16.312 --> 23:18.303
how it would change you.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.480
- It didn't change anything.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.103
This was always meant to be.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.025
- I don't think it was.

23:30.159 --> 23:33.651
I think you were fighting your destiny.

23:34.247 --> 23:38.365
And if left alone,
maybe you might have even won.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.786
But I didn't know that.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.958
And I came along,
and I sent you on that path.

23:44.090 --> 23:48.208
And for that, I am truly sorry.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.714
I know how it feels, Duke,
to be fighting to be the person

23:53.850 --> 23:57.217
that you want to be when everyone
is telling you to be someone else.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.060
Croatoan thinks that I'm his daughter.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.225
l-l look like her.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.643
I sound like her.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.392
Do you know how easy it
would be to just say,

24:06.529 --> 24:07.894
"Sure,

24:08.573 --> 24:10.734
it's good to see you, Dad,"

24:12.869 --> 24:14.905
and stop being scared?

24:18.708 --> 24:20.869
I'm so tired.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.300
I'm so tired of fighting my destiny.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.881
But I can't give up.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.558
Because when I look in the mirror,

24:40.063 --> 24:42.054
I only see me.

24:43.066 --> 24:47.309
| see the person that I truly am.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.112
The only person I want to be.

24:51.908 --> 24:55.821
So tell me, Duke,
when you look in the mirror,

24:56.579 --> 24:58.786
when no one else is around,

24:58.915 --> 25:03.249
who are you?

25:17.642 --> 25:18.597
(clattering)

25:20.311 --> 25:21.687
- I'm Duke Crocker.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.930
And | just want to go back
to being a pirate.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.108
(sobbing)

25:46.129 --> 25:49.621
- Time to eat your peanut butter.
I already ate mine. Yuck.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.548
- Maybe we shouldn't eat
the cookies we don't like.

25:52.677 --> 25:55.544
- But we always do it that way.
You have to eat the yucky one.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.841
- Why, Lizzie?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.966
Why do we always eat
a cookie we don't like?

26:01.561 --> 26:03.017
- 'Cause that's how life is.

26:03.146 --> 26:06.684
Sometimes it hands you a bad cookie,
like when you got hurt in the Army,

26:06.816 --> 26:09.478
or when Mom left us.

26:11.154 --> 26:14.612
- But if you hang in there,
the good cookies will come, right?

26:14.741 --> 26:17.153
- Right, like how we still have each other.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.620
- Like how we still have each other.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.579
(gentle music)

26:33.760 --> 26:35.125
- Hey.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.429
- Welcome back, kiddo.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.379
- Glad to be back.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.016
- I knew you could beat him.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.007
- Yeah, not soon enough.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.268
- We have to make sure
that Croatoan doesn't find out about you.

26:46.397 --> 26:49.685
Is there any way that you can use
your phasing Trouble to get out of town?

26:49.817 --> 26:51.353
- I'm not going anywhere.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.614
I'm going to kill Croatoan.

26:56.032 --> 26:59.365
- No. No way.
You're not going anywhere near him.

26:59.869 --> 27:03.361
- Nathan, the things that he made me do,

27:03.706 --> 27:05.867
the people I killed, the friends I hurt,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.288
what I did to the both of you...
He's trying to split you up.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.411
He knows you are stronger together.

27:11.547 --> 27:15.085
Please, you have to let me help.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.583
I need to make things right.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.925
- You will.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.089
I promise.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.929
But we have to be careful.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.014
lf Croatoan gets a hold of
one of your Troubles...

27:24.143 --> 27:26.930
(eerie music)

27:27.063 --> 27:29.520
(groaning)

27:30.900 --> 27:32.561
What? What's wrong?

27:32.693 --> 27:34.069
- He knows.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.561
Croatoan knows.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.733
He's taking them. I can't stop him.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.156
- What can we do?

27:51.212 --> 27:53.294
There's got to be something that we can do.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.287
- There is.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.098
You have to kill me.

28:13.651 --> 28:16.063
You have to kill me. Now.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.571
Before he takes any more!

28:17.697 --> 28:20.154
- There has to be another way.
- There isn't!

28:20.283 --> 28:22.649
- Duke...
- Whenever a Crocker has died,

28:22.785 --> 28:24.116
the Troubles stayed with him!

28:26.622 --> 28:27.828
If I'm dead,

28:29.292 --> 28:31.499
Croatoan has no way of collecting them.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.209
- No, Duke.

28:36.007 --> 28:37.167
I can't.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.710
- Yes, you can, Nathan.

28:40.678 --> 28:44.170
You can to save Haven, to save Audrey.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.889
- No. No, not like this.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.555
- I'd do it myself,
I'd go to the roof and jump.

28:49.687 --> 28:52.349
But if I break open
and bleed out all my Troubles,

28:52.481 --> 28:54.187
then I died for nothing!

28:55.902 --> 28:58.234
Croatoan took everything from me.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.565
l have to take something back.

29:00.698 --> 29:04.316
l have to choose my destiny.

29:07.663 --> 29:11.201
l have to show Croatoan
that Duke Crocker's nobody's bitch.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.502
So please.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.543
Please.

29:21.510 --> 29:22.761
Come on, please.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.089
Please!

29:26.515 --> 29:27.891
(sighs)

29:28.017 --> 29:29.348
Gloria?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.055
- No, I'm sorry, Duke.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.103
- Do you see that?

29:38.235 --> 29:39.896
Who knows which one that was!

29:40.029 --> 29:44.272
You have no idea the horrible Troubles
that I've taken inside of me!

29:44.408 --> 29:47.696
And if I let Croatoan get them,
then he wins!

29:50.206 --> 29:52.242
That's not my destiny.

29:56.921 --> 29:58.206
That's not me.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.254
- No.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.588
- Nathan, please.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.760
I can't do it myself.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.254
There's no time.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.301
- I know.

30:10.434 --> 30:11.935
(sighs)

30:12.061 --> 30:13.972
Everything's gonna be all right.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.730
(gaSDS)

30:24.615 --> 30:26.355
(Audrey): Nathan.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.527
(grunts)

30:27.660 --> 30:29.150
(crying)

30:39.505 --> 30:40.585
Hey.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.587
Duke, it's gonna be okay, all right?

30:45.428 --> 30:47.259
We love you.

30:49.849 --> 30:53.307
- You are the bravest man I ever met,
Duke Crocker, you always have been.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.972
So much we've done together.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.518
So much we never could've done without you.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.976
I owe you so much.

31:03.112 --> 31:07.151
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to repay that debt.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.660
- Oh, God.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.781
(somber music)

31:28.054 --> 31:29.043
(exhales)

31:49.992 --> 31:54.861
- I'm so sorry.
What Duke became wasn't who he was.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.955
- No, and in the end, it's what saved us.

31:59.335 --> 32:00.745
- Maybe all of Haven.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.709
lt stopped Croatoan
from getting his Troubles.

32:02.838 --> 32:05.500
- The Aether core, it's destroyed.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.667
There will be no way to build a new Barn,
no way to end the Troubles.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.588
(somber music)

32:31.742 --> 32:35.075
- Dwight, maybe you can just help me
get him to the truck.

32:35.204 --> 32:40.915
We'll put him on ice until we can give him
a proper burial at sea with Jennifer.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.455
He would like that.
(Nathan): Yeah.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.452
At sea.

32:50.386 --> 32:53.378
I'm gonna take a walk.
Be back in a minute.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.094
(sighs)

33:03.566 --> 33:06.649
(footsteps approaching)

33:08.487 --> 33:10.023
- Oh, Dwight, glad you came.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.522
- That makes one of us.
- Difficult decision, I'm sure.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.613
You brought the crystal?

33:13.742 --> 33:15.698
- Crystal's useless now.
Why do you even want it?

33:15.828 --> 33:17.193
- Useless to you.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.536
I can do wonders
with the technology behind it.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.871
- What do you mean?

33:23.169 --> 33:26.787
- This room is similar
to the one my daughter grew up in.

33:27.840 --> 33:32.209
I intend to make an exact copy
of this entire house.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.629
- You want to rebuild a house?

33:33.762 --> 33:36.799
- Not a house, a home.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.975
When Audreyjoins me,

33:43.022 --> 33:45.638
we'll live here together,
and we'll be a family once again.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.310
Without Charlotte, of course.

33:47.443 --> 33:48.774
- Because you murdered her.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.360
- Charlotte betrayed me.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.823
She had me banished.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.907
Then she tried to poison Mara with lies.
Then she killed her.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.576
- Mara was evil.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.494
Like father, like daughter.
But Charlotte...

34:04.627 --> 34:07.869
- Charlotte was good in the sack.
Yeah, she had that going for her.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.212
You know, Dwight,

34:11.342 --> 34:13.583
you're lucky that l have
other concerns right now.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.132
You've seen what I can do with people
who try to take what's mine.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.718
So...

34:20.851 --> 34:24.469
the crystal or Lizzie?

34:25.022 --> 34:26.683
Which are you gonna bring me?

34:28.150 --> 34:30.607
Are you really going to walk away?

34:30.736 --> 34:33.819
I'm giving you a second chance
with your daughter, Dwight.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.027
l, more than anyone,
know how remarkable that can be.

34:37.534 --> 34:41.493
Are you really going to walk away from it?

34:45.501 --> 34:47.162
- I'll be back in a few hours.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.710
With the crystal.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.589
- You made the right choice, Dwight.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.833
You all have.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.927
(soft music)

35:17.408 --> 35:19.069
(chuckles)

35:20.369 --> 35:21.575
- Thanks, Laverne.

35:23.372 --> 35:24.532
I needed that.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.910
(phone ringing)

35:30.212 --> 35:33.079
Laverne, what is it?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.046
ls some... is something wrong?

35:43.309 --> 35:45.800
Good, Nathan's back.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.808
Laverne, where is he going?

35:52.484 --> 35:53.473
Try to follow him.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.741
No.

36:05.247 --> 36:06.327
Where are they going?

36:11.587 --> 36:14.624
- Last time it was the carrot,
so I assume you're here with a stick.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.122
(chuckles)

36:16.258 --> 36:19.375
- There's that wry sense of humor
the girls love.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.969
Mara thought William was hilarious.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.929
I thought he was a moron.

36:26.310 --> 36:27.550
What do you want?

36:27.686 --> 36:30.393
- To offer my condolences.
Shame about Duke.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.935
The Crockers grew so cowardly
over the years.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.810
Duke died so you wouldn't get
any of his Troubles.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.486
He died a hero.

36:39.615 --> 36:41.526
- He walked away from greatness.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.152
Have you thought any more about my offer?

36:46.288 --> 36:47.653
- No.

36:47.790 --> 36:49.371
My future's here.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.833
- Not without Audrey, it isn't.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.374
- What have you done with Audrey?

36:57.341 --> 36:58.672
Where is she?

36:58.801 --> 37:00.883
- Audrey is going to be exactly
where she belongs...

37:01.011 --> 37:04.879
By her father's side.
Which means you...

37:07.309 --> 37:09.891
need to leave Haven.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.154
I knew you'd come here, someplace familiar.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.579
If you need to talk...

37:32.418 --> 37:34.704
- What have you done with Nathan?

37:34.837 --> 37:36.202
If you've hurt him...

37:36.338 --> 37:37.544
- Hurt him?

37:38.549 --> 37:41.211
Nathan told me he had said his goodbyes.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.009
- His goodbyes?

37:46.098 --> 37:47.383
What does that mean?

37:47.516 --> 37:49.928
- Before he left with your copy.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.891
I thought you knew. I'm so sorry.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.604
- No.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.151
No, that's not true.

38:02.281 --> 38:03.942
- I'm afraid it is.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.527
Nathan is...

38:07.536 --> 38:09.117
beyond the shroud.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.450
(indistinct chatter)

38:30.642 --> 38:31.597
- Parker.

38:31.727 --> 38:32.762
- Nathan.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.270
This is weird.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.980
- Yeah.

38:39.443 --> 38:40.808
- What can I get you two?

38:40.944 --> 38:44.107
- Uh, actually maybe you could tell me,

38:44.239 --> 38:47.276
did you see us come in?

38:47.409 --> 38:50.446
- Oh, things get so busy
around here sometimes,

38:50.579 --> 38:52.410
all | see are hash browns.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.328
But...

38:55.417 --> 38:58.955
now that I come to think of it,
I could've sworn this table was empty,

38:59.087 --> 39:01.669
and then I turned around,
and there you were.

39:03.008 --> 39:06.045
Ah, maybe we all need a cup of coffee?

39:06.178 --> 39:07.793
- Sugar.
- Black.

39:07.930 --> 39:08.965
- Thanks.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.440
Don't worry.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.867
At least we're together.
We'll figure it out.

39:32.996 --> 39:36.033
- Yeah.
We always do.

39:39.795 --> 39:42.002
- Nathan told me he changed his mind.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.166
The tragedy of having to kill his friend...

39:44.299 --> 39:46.039
He realized the futility of fighting me.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.552
- No.

39:48.345 --> 39:51.007
Nathan never would've left
of his own free will.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.845
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.466
He begged me to take him away from Haven.

39:55.852 --> 40:00.186
He said that... saving the world...

40:01.191 --> 40:03.182
had become too exhausting.

40:03.986 --> 40:07.570
I know you're upset.
But really, isn't this what you want?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.529
Nathan far away

40:09.658 --> 40:12.525
from the terrible dangers
he would've faced?

40:16.248 --> 40:17.454
- Dangers?

40:17.583 --> 40:19.244
- Well, once we begin our experiments,

40:19.835 --> 40:21.621
there will be a lot of trial and error.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.005
Things will become...

40:24.923 --> 40:26.038
volatile.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.007
- No. I'm not helping you.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.627
- This is what you were meant to do.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.846
Nathan abandoned you.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.303
But not me.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.266
I will never abandon you.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.902
You don't have to be so morose.

40:53.035 --> 40:57.870
Attitude is the paintbrush
that colors our world.

41:03.587 --> 41:07.079
ahunded

41:07.215 --> 41:09.206
What we're about to do will be wonderful.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.267
(shivers)

41:20.395 --> 41:22.602
- What is that?

41:22.731 --> 41:25.564
- Mm, the question is, what is behind that?

41:26.109 --> 41:28.725
I'm using an abrasion Trouble

41:29.237 --> 41:31.899
to create an opening to the Void.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.614
Why is it...
- Turning black?

41:34.743 --> 41:36.279
lt's filling with Aether.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.948
And soon it will rain,

41:39.081 --> 41:42.539
and then you and I will begin our work.

41:42.668 --> 41:46.911
And it won't seem like work
because we'll have casual Friday,

41:47.798 --> 41:50.414
we'll have music, bring dogs.

41:55.764 --> 41:58.130
Take a few hours
before there's enough Aether...

41:58.934 --> 42:01.266
and we can get to work, so...

42:01.937 --> 42:04.394
go grieve,

42:04.523 --> 42:09.563
make your peace,
do whatever you have to do to move on,

42:09.695 --> 42:11.105
because Nathan

42:12.280 --> 42:13.531
is gone.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.318
Your life...

42:18.662 --> 42:21.529
is with me, here,

42:22.457 --> 42:23.788
HOW.

42:52.654 --> 42:55.521
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
