00:02.711 --> 00:04.755
<i>My fellow global citizens.</i>

00:04.755 --> 00:10.594
<i>Today at 0942 UTC, the global community
will attempt a coordinated response</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:13.263
<i>to the alien aggressors
who have invaded our world.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.957
- Hey! Watch the pave, bro!
- Fuck. Sorry. Sorry.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.166
Monty!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.753
You find it yet? The hospital's address.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.090
I think it's this building here.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.133
<i>Septième arrondissement.</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:52.010
Caspar's got good taste.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.638
Sorry, was that supposed to be French?

00:54.638 --> 00:57.432
Monty's French teacher
says his consonants are clumsy.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.227
My French is excellent, okay?
I just need a bit of practice.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.312
Oh, okay. Cool, no problem.
Repeat after me.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.607
Shia LaBeouf, Zooey Deschanel,

01:06.275 --> 01:07.985
Timothée Chalamet.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.945
- Beyoncé? Yeah.
- Beyoncé?

01:09.945 --> 01:13.490
- Can we please change the music?
- No, Pen. Give that back now.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.492
- Trap. Rap.
- Pen. Stop.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.411
- Pen, stop.
- More rap.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.496
Wait, what's this?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.338
Is this "Kiss from a Rose"?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.966
- Pen, turn that off now.
- Are you kidding?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.593
- Pen.
- Turn that up.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.389
Oh, shit. Slow down.
Monty, slow down. Look!

01:50.027 --> 01:51.278
Fucking hell.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.117
What they all looking at?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.786
Hey. W--

02:03.916 --> 02:04.917
Excuse me.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.461
- What's happening?
- Tunnel's closed. No entry.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.339
Closed? Why?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.257
Last train from France never made it here.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.550
Recon team went in, never came out.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.136
Now the French are threatening
to close their end permanently.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.431
So either you and the Jag can turn around
now, or you can wait like the rest of us.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.976
- Wait for what?
- What, you not got a radio in that thing?

02:23.477 --> 02:25.437
It's been playing on loop
since she made the announcement.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.619
What is it? What's happening?

02:44.706 --> 02:47.251
<i>...outnumbered, outflanked, outgunned.</i>

02:47.251 --> 02:49.503
<i>I cannot guarantee that we will succeed,</i>

02:49.503 --> 02:52.965
<i>but what I can say is
we'll try to hit them back where it hurts.</i>

02:52.965 --> 02:54.716
-"Hit them back"? Wh--
- <i>Let them feel a fraction...</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:57.469
- It's an-- It's an attack. It's gotta be.
- Monty?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.096
- It's fine. It's fine.
- <i>"Never let them see you</i>

02:59.096 --> 03:00.472
<i>with your head bowed."</i>

03:00.472 --> 03:03.642
<i>So I ask you now to look up.</i>

03:03.642 --> 03:05.811
<i>Look up. Let us no--</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:08.480
The hell are you doing?
Something's happening.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.232
Yeah, we're taking that tunnel to France.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.734
- We are?
- Are you completely nuts?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.653
Turn around and drive.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.129
So let me get this straight,

03:32.129 --> 03:34.798
you're still keen to go in,
despite the military warnings?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.551
- Are we going to get arrested?
- No, we're not.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.554
- Are we?
- There's the tunnel.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.267
Shit.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.644
No good. We'll never scale that fence
without somebody seeing.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.104
How are we gonna get in then?

03:51.148 --> 03:53.358
- There! Monty, pull up there now.
- Yeah.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.456
- Think it leads down to the tunnel?
- One way to find out.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.334
Hey, wait.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.044
I'll get the crowbar from the boot.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.757
This is all.
I mean, if soldiers went down...

04:17.757 --> 04:19.593
You know, it's...

04:23.597 --> 04:25.849
Okay, look.
It's not about me, okay? I just...

04:29.186 --> 04:30.646
I can't let nothing happen to her.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.274
It's all good.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.027
You've gotten us this far,

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
so thank you.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.783
Does this mean
we're not going to save Mum and Dad?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.205
Would you like me to help?

04:55.671 --> 04:58.590
Course we're going
to save Mum and Dad, okay?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.301
Look, it just means when we get there,

05:02.010 --> 05:04.555
I need you to listen to me
and do whatever I say,

05:04.555 --> 05:08.976
and not be your usual annoying,
whining, clawing self.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.060
Okay? Can you do that?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.479
Yes, as long as you're not your usual
manky, numpty...

05:12.479 --> 05:13.730
- Yeah.
- ...knobhead self--

05:13.730 --> 05:15.148
Yeah. Sod off, please.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.237
What? You think we wasn't coming?

05:20.737 --> 05:21.989
Let's go then.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.950
Push harder, you dick.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.681
Shit. Soldiers.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.017
Quick. Before they see us. Go.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.461
Here we are.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.304
Looks like the point of no return. Eh?

06:27.930 --> 06:29.598
Don't worry. I thought ahead.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.975
Pen, what's that?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.311
My report from our class trip
to the Channel Tunnel.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.021
I drew a map and everything. See?

06:40.609 --> 06:41.860
I brought help too.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.782
Alien repellant. Homemade flamethrower.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.909
Bond did it in <i>Live and Let Die</i>.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.579
Yeah, but, Alf, that'll just blow
your hands off, you know, in real life.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.128
What the hell just happened?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.213
Are they attacking us?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.423
Or are we attacking them?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.341
Power's still on.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.176
That's good. Let's go!

07:08.804 --> 07:11.515
I'm sorry.
Not to be the only one living in real life

07:11.515 --> 07:14.434
right now, but something absolutely major
just happened back there.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.729
So, new plan, we head back
just to see, you know--

07:17.729 --> 07:19.314
No! We stay put.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.109
If we go back out,
they could spot us and stop us.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.112
- Yeah, but we don't know what's out there.
- You're right. We don't.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.532
But we do know this tunnel is
the only way to get to Caspar.

07:29.658 --> 07:33.161
This says that the service entrance
joins up with the train tunnel up ahead.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.545
Look, it's fine to feel scared.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.256
It would be mental not to.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.426
But it's been four months
since those things showed up.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.721
And I'm so tired of this shit!

07:54.474 --> 07:59.313
My mum told me once
in critical surgery or whatever,

08:00.397 --> 08:01.607
there's, like, this moment

08:02.399 --> 08:04.735
when the body on the table makes a choice.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.987
To fight

08:06.987 --> 08:09.448
or to let go, and you can see it happen.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.327
Our friend is waiting for us.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.623
If we can find him, maybe our species
at least has a shot.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.250
So this is it, the moment.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.253
Do we fight or let go?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.302
For Caspar.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.015
For Casp.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.559
Caspar.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.943
Yeah. Right. We're in too then, I guess.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.215
<i>It's a truly momentous victory.</i>

10:31.215 --> 10:32.758
<i>For those now joining us,</i>

10:32.758 --> 10:36.553
<i>seven alien ships have been successfully
shot down by the World Defense Coalition.</i>

10:36.553 --> 10:40.140
<i>As of yet, there has been no response
from the alien invaders,</i>

10:40.140 --> 10:42.267
<i>nor any retaliation from the mothership.</i>

10:42.267 --> 10:45.646
<i>But sources indicate that coalition forces
are optimistic</i>

10:45.646 --> 10:47.898
<i>we may have dealt a critical blow.</i>

10:47.898 --> 10:53.695
<i>WDC President Benya Mabote has reportedly
ordered military units to the crash sites...</i>

11:23.183 --> 11:25.310
SECURE WARD

12:32.878 --> 12:35.422
You're missing the big day, Caspar.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.009
Why don't you
wake up and join the fun, hmm?

12:40.511 --> 12:42.179
Who's to say he's not having fun?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.310
We know so little about this one.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.270
Seems a shame to assume anything.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.730
From his brain activity, Gabriel,

12:51.730 --> 12:54.566
we can assume he's been experiencing
on average seven seizures every hour.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.694
Not exactly a party.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.698
Fair enough.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.457
So much research on these kids
and their connection to our visitors.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.752
Hoping to find a key.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.298
Maybe after today, we won't need one.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.718
Speaking of,
a few of us were going to open a bottle

13:21.718 --> 13:23.595
later this evening.
A little victory celebration.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.722
Care to join?

13:26.557 --> 13:27.933
Victory.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.478
The most important skill
a neurologist can learn Esmee,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.188
is knowing when to turn their brain off.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.778
Especially
when a patient is beyond saving.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.873
Please wake up, Caspar.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.880
In school,
we spent a whole week studying bridges,

13:57.880 --> 13:59.923
but tunnels are much more interesting,

13:59.923 --> 14:02.968
because tunnels are about length,
and tunnels are about depth,

14:02.968 --> 14:04.887
and tunnels are about pressure.

14:05.929 --> 14:09.600
Look. See that thing up there?
It's one of the piston relief ducts.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.727
It runs all the way through
the other train tunnel.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.354
Miss Malkin said if we didn't have one
of those, the pressure in here

14:14.354 --> 14:17.983
- would pop skulls like champagne corks.
- Jesus Christ, Pen. That's enough.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.776
They're just entertaining facts.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.778
Yeah? Well, you've been entertaining us
for an hour.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.322
Pipe down now, yeah?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
Anyone else feel that?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.118
- The cold?
- I know.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.245
It's like we're on ice or something, like...

14:30.245 --> 14:31.747
Monty's dating life.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.081
That's absolute tosh, mate.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.751
It's true, Monty.
You haven't had a girlfriend since Brexit.

14:35.751 --> 14:36.835
Penny!

14:36.835 --> 14:39.171
- It's just a fact.
- Nobody needs to know.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.881
Just like nobody needs to know
about pressure

14:40.881 --> 14:42.966
and wiring and the other shit
you've been going on about.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.426
Hey, you promised to do what I say.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.012
Well, now I say
put a fucking sock in it, yeah?

14:47.012 --> 14:48.096
Great.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.350
Who needs a dating life when
I've got your mom on call 24/7, mate?

14:51.350 --> 14:52.601
Shut up.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.191
Christ, baby sisters are the worst.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.193
I'm a baby sister.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.403
And you were a prick to her just now.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.783
She's probably nervous. I mean,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.285
- who wouldn't be?
- You're kidding.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.121
Strolling down
a dark, abandoned train tunnel

15:13.121 --> 15:15.290
with a thousand trillion liters of water
above our heads.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.376
Every kid's dream, innit?

15:17.376 --> 15:19.670
Yeah. A real quest for the ages.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.381
Alfie's mom a good snog?

15:22.965 --> 15:25.592
Yeah, no. She's definitely in the top ten.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.302
Just under Judi Dench, so...

15:29.763 --> 15:31.348
So, when did you figure it out?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.183
About Caspar?

15:33.684 --> 15:34.685
Figure what?

15:35.352 --> 15:37.396
That he was, I don't know, special.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.024
I didn't at first.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.318
Looking back,

15:44.027 --> 15:45.028
yeah.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.364
There was always something about him.

15:48.198 --> 15:53.829
Like he was tuned into some wavelength
of some song the rest of us couldn't hear.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.831
Like his ancient Walkman.

15:56.665 --> 15:57.666
Old stuff.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.210
God, I used to needle him all the time,
now that I think.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.504
But the truth is,
I actually thought it was pretty cool.

16:02.504 --> 16:03.839
Bullshit.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.258
You didn't needle him, you hated him.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.512
Come on. It's not like it's a secret.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.306
You were shit to him.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.270
Don't get me wrong. I'm glad you're here.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.691
I guess I just don't know why you're here.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.071
Like you said,
gotta take our world back, right?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.281
Simple as that.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.574
"Simple as that"?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.203
Sure. I mean, why else would I be here?

16:35.913 --> 16:37.080
Holy shit!

16:38.207 --> 16:39.208
Oh, God.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.300
The recon team.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.345
Aliens did this. They're here.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.433
Oi, you all right?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.268
- Back off!
- Bro, I'm just trying to help.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.395
Well, he doesn't want it, does he?
Not from you.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.523
Not from either of you.
I'm not a bloody invalid.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.192
I just wasn't expecting to see that.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.569
Wait, wait, wait. Where's Penny?

17:09.863 --> 17:10.864
Shit. Where'd she go?

17:11.615 --> 17:13.742
- Penny?
- She was right behind us, wasn't she?

17:13.742 --> 17:15.536
Maybe she passed us.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.955
Pen, get back here right now.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.042
Pen?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.925
Oh, my God.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.678
- Run!
- Go!

17:34.471 --> 17:35.639
- Monty.
- Fuck.

17:35.639 --> 17:39.309
- Shit, I'm stuck! I'm stuck!
- Monty, get up. Monty!

17:39.309 --> 17:40.811
Pull! Pull!

17:41.478 --> 17:42.771
Where's my lighter?

17:42.771 --> 17:44.565
- Fuck, I can't find my lighter.
- Guys.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.650
Oh, shit!

17:58.996 --> 18:00.163
Fuck.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.420
Fuck.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.214
What happened to that thing?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.967
It looked, I don't know, sick.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.262
It's really cold. I can feel it from here.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.513
I think it stopped breathing.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.640
Did it even breathe? Or have lungs or--

18:18.640 --> 18:20.434
Whatever, who gives a shit?

18:20.434 --> 18:23.896
Penny's missing, and you lot are going on
about this-this fucking thing's anatomy.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.065
The only breathing I care about
right now, yeah, is Penny's.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.860
You always said
my breath smells like dead rats.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.278
Pen. Oh, my God.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.948
Come on.
Don't ever run away like that, yeah?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.700
I wasn't running, I was exploring.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.120
And if you like that lumpy thing,
you're going to love what I found.

18:43.624 --> 18:44.625
Broken.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.014
Home.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.450
Soon.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.499
They're finished, it's over!

19:25.499 --> 19:27.501
Just the person who needs to see this.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.461
A moment, Prisha.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.215
I was on a walk to clear my head,

19:33.215 --> 19:37.010
and a few blocks from here, saw this.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.681
It's happening all over.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.350
They're dying, Esmee.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.143
We did it.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.396
We did it.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.488
- What's that?
- A crossway. They're on the map.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.866
- We walked right by it.
- Where does it lead?

19:58.866 --> 20:01.076
Another tunnel for workers, I think.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.163
There's no tracks to trip up on,
which means we go faster.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.124
Lead the way.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.424
See? What did I tell you?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.891
Penny, be careful, you nutter.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.642
It's okay. I was scared too at first.

20:25.642 --> 20:29.605
But this lot's dead as dodos.
Ice-cold too.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.071
That's why the temperature's so low.
All of these things.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.325
Do you think it was the attack they were
talking about on radio that killed them?

20:41.325 --> 20:44.453
Maybe. Maybe they'll just
curl up and leave us alone.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.787
Wouldn't that be terrific?

20:45.787 --> 20:48.248
Please. They're not all
gonna catch the flu and die, Pen.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.583
You don't know that.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.293
You looked up at the sky recently, mate?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.587
You didn't see anything highly evolved
up there, did you?

20:53.587 --> 20:56.340
Haven't seen nothing highly
evolved down here, for sure.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.051
Would you two just back off each other?

20:59.051 --> 21:00.928
Jamila, what's going on?

21:10.896 --> 21:12.064
What is it?

21:12.064 --> 21:13.148
Don't know.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.953
Let me try something.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.919
What's that noise? Sounds like
my mum's wind chimes or something.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.886
Show's over, I guess.

22:23.886 --> 22:25.554
That wasn't a show.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.307
It was a transmission.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.102
A message from them.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.228
To who?

22:33.812 --> 22:35.230
And what did it say?

22:37.482 --> 22:38.692
Come on.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.945
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.016
What the hell happened here?

23:11.600 --> 23:12.851
Is that security?

23:14.102 --> 23:16.021
Looks like some kind of last stand.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.857
Didn't stand long, did they?

23:22.069 --> 23:24.571
This is some straight-up Godzilla shit.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.699
They must have been
protecting something or--

23:27.699 --> 23:29.409
What? More tunnels?

23:30.911 --> 23:31.912
This.

23:33.914 --> 23:34.915
Christ.

23:34.915 --> 23:36.875
They couldn't get the gate closed in time.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.877
The aliens slaughtered them.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.965
Penny?

23:42.965 --> 23:45.634
Pen, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me. It's all right, okay?

23:45.634 --> 23:47.386
It's just another panic attack.
You all right?

23:47.386 --> 23:49.721
- We're fine. You're fine, Penny. Fine.
- I feel it. I feel it.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.014
- You feel what?
- I feel it.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.062
- I feel it.
- Feel what?

24:04.570 --> 24:07.781
Doctor...
Doctor please, I can't understand you...

24:08.448 --> 24:10.993
The line is breaking up,
can you say that again?

24:11.952 --> 24:14.371
It's Saint-Louis Hospital.
Something's wrong.

24:15.205 --> 24:16.290
Hello, this is Dr. Gagneux.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.792
<i>...they all appear to be victims
of some kind of attack.</i>

24:19.751 --> 24:21.086
<i>We're overwhelmed,</i>

24:21.086 --> 24:23.547
<i>we need someone to take...</i>

24:23.547 --> 24:26.633
- <i>We're overwhelmed, we need someone...</i>
- Doctor, are you there?

24:31.138 --> 24:33.223
EMERGENCY

24:46.737 --> 24:49.907
Gently, gently. Breathe.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.450
What did this to you?

24:51.450 --> 24:54.119
Forget me. Get everyone... to safety...

24:54.494 --> 24:56.455
I need help over here!

25:00.417 --> 25:03.420
They're coming...

25:03.420 --> 25:05.214
and they're worse...

25:28.362 --> 25:29.738
Go, go, go, now! Go now!

25:29.738 --> 25:31.949
- Fuck. Move him!
- Shit. What do we do?

25:32.741 --> 25:35.285
Darwin. Darwin, go! Penny, go with me.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.704
Push.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.918
We have got to get out of here.

25:43.669 --> 25:44.670
Hey, Penny.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.588
Penny. Penny, look at me.

25:47.172 --> 25:50.050
Hey. Close your eyes, okay?

25:50.676 --> 25:52.386
We're going to
walk the maze together, yeah?

25:52.386 --> 25:55.681
Can you see it, the maze? Great, okay.
You're walking forward.

25:55.681 --> 25:58.767
Tall hedges on either side protecting you.
But there's a fork.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.102
You know where to go, yeah? You turn...

26:00.102 --> 26:01.854
- Left.
- There you go. You turn left.

26:01.854 --> 26:02.980
Now, you're walking forward.

26:02.980 --> 26:05.274
<i>And then there's a corner. Then you turn...</i>

26:05.274 --> 26:07.234
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>Exactly. Right, yes.</i>

26:07.818 --> 26:10.070
Wajo. Wajo. Wajo...

26:12.865 --> 26:15.117
Everyone, listen to me...
Take the children with you and go!

26:15.117 --> 26:18.328
Gather all the essential research,
everything you can.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.081
Quickly!

26:23.584 --> 26:25.252
Esmee, what's going on?

26:25.586 --> 26:27.671
They're not dead, Gabriel.

26:27.671 --> 26:30.465
They're coming back.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.676
And they're worse.

26:36.138 --> 26:38.348
Get everything you can and go!

26:38.348 --> 26:40.058
This is not a test.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.646
Sarah, grab my files.

26:45.898 --> 26:46.732
Esmee...

26:47.107 --> 26:49.067
- In his condition, we can't possibly...
- I know.

26:49.067 --> 26:52.821
- We'd do more harm than good.
- I said I know. Go help the others.

26:54.656 --> 26:55.782
And Gabriel?

26:56.283 --> 26:58.911
Tell the guards out there
to protect this boy at all costs.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.713
You're a survivor, Caspar.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.550
Survive.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.848
- <i>I'm scared.</i>
- <i>No, you're not. We've been here before.</i>

27:19.848 --> 27:22.100
- Where do you turn?
- Left. Then right.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.185
Then right again.

27:23.185 --> 27:26.396
Yes, yes, yes. Now you're at the center
of the garden with me.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.065
You made it.

27:29.358 --> 27:30.651
Yeah?

27:32.110 --> 27:33.737
Get back, guys! Now!

27:43.747 --> 27:46.250
What the hell are those? They're huge!

27:46.959 --> 27:49.253
Oh, God. What are they?

27:51.588 --> 27:54.341
- Alf? What are you doing? Alf!
- Fucking...

28:01.390 --> 28:02.432
Yes!

28:03.642 --> 28:06.937
It's not working. The fire's not working!

28:07.604 --> 28:08.981
Come on!

28:09.565 --> 28:10.482
Go. Jump.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.611
- We have to shut the door.
- Here.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.113
Come on. Go.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.782
Come on, guys! Guys, turn it.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.911
- Guys, gate's giving way. Hurry. Please!
- That's it, more to me.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.541
- It can't go any faster!
- Come on! Quicker!

28:27.541 --> 28:30.127
Guys, guys.
Guys, quickly! Quickly, Darwin! Close it!

28:46.185 --> 28:48.896
We can't stay here. Come on.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.107
Go, go, go, go. Penny, go.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.677
What I wouldn't give
for a cozy fire right now.

29:20.677 --> 29:24.139
Well, I had some of those heat packs
in my backpack, but they're gone.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.642
The gear, the food--

29:26.642 --> 29:28.393
Please don't mention food right now.

29:29.353 --> 29:30.479
Any idea how much longer?

29:33.148 --> 29:36.443
I guess those aliens weren't dead
after all. They were just napping.

29:37.027 --> 29:39.446
Yeah, but they woke up different,
like they're evolving or something.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.573
That's great. We barely knew
how to fight the first ones.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.116
How else are we going to stop these...

29:45.202 --> 29:46.578
- these--
- Jesus.

29:50.249 --> 29:52.042
Looks like it hit those bastards.

29:52.626 --> 29:54.711
So this is where
all those people came from.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.464
Well, that way's blocked.

29:58.048 --> 30:00.384
Yeah. Looks like a live wire
up there as well.

30:00.384 --> 30:01.802
Let's go through this way.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.985
It's blocked. Let's cut through here.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.032
Oh, shit.

30:27.369 --> 30:31.331
It's like a car wreck
inside of a train wreck.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.416
What a mess.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.711
Look, Penny's exhausted and freezing.

30:35.711 --> 30:38.297
She needs to rest, and seeing that
we are stuck here for the moment, we--

30:38.297 --> 30:39.798
So you're giving up, yeah?

30:39.798 --> 30:42.301
- Fucking knew it.
- I'm not giving up, you prick.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.178
- I'm just calling a break.
-"Calling a break"?

30:44.178 --> 30:45.345
So you're team captain now.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.431
Stop fighting, both of you.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.682
Jam, what do you think?

30:51.393 --> 30:52.227
Forget it.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.814
Me and Darwin will go scavenge up
some supplies to replace what we lost.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.774
Let's go. Enjoy your break, yeah?

31:05.157 --> 31:06.658
Nope. Okay.

31:07.951 --> 31:10.370
- Then let's check this one, yeah?
- This one?

31:10.370 --> 31:11.830
- Yes.
- This the one?

31:12.873 --> 31:14.416
Yeah, great. This will work.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.627
All right, Penny. Hop in.

31:19.922 --> 31:22.299
See, look. Blanket and everything.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.009
Okay, Penny, lie down.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.723
Okay. Pillow fort, here we come.

31:32.184 --> 31:35.896
Complete with a night-light.

31:37.439 --> 31:38.607
All right.

31:39.233 --> 31:40.317
Okay.

31:44.655 --> 31:45.656
Good night, Pen.

31:54.373 --> 31:55.916
You haven't said a word in hours.

31:56.625 --> 31:57.626
Something wrong?

31:58.293 --> 31:59.586
Besides, I mean, everything?

32:00.712 --> 32:02.005
You're good with her, you know?

32:03.966 --> 32:05.384
You sound surprised.

32:06.051 --> 32:08.178
I've just never seen you like that.

32:10.848 --> 32:12.558
You really know what she needs.

32:16.436 --> 32:20.190
What was that thing before?
"You turn left, turn right..."

32:23.151 --> 32:24.486
That.

32:24.486 --> 32:25.571
The maze.

32:26.655 --> 32:27.906
Weird, innit?

32:29.241 --> 32:33.036
A few years back when things got bad
at home, Penny would get these--

32:33.579 --> 32:34.913
these attacks, you know?

32:35.497 --> 32:39.042
I noticed only certain things would
calm her down like maps and--

32:39.042 --> 32:40.169
and bus routes.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.714
We'd stash them everywhere. And when
she did get scared, we'd pull one out

32:43.714 --> 32:45.215
and trace a path.

32:46.758 --> 32:51.805
But, one time we were on a walk,
and a cyclist got hit.

32:52.598 --> 32:56.185
Mercedes just hammered him.
The bloke flew across the street,

32:56.810 --> 32:57.936
a few yards from Penny.

32:58.645 --> 33:00.230
- Christ.
- Yeah.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.065
Penny lost it.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.818
I mean completely lost it.
No map, nothing.

33:05.694 --> 33:09.823
So, on the spot, I made up this maze.

33:10.657 --> 33:14.745
God, it sounds so stupid, but--
"Turn left. Turn right."

33:15.579 --> 33:17.456
And that's what we've been doing
ever since.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.292
You fixed it.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.128
Made it better.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.966
Listen, you're not to blame for all this.
You know that, right?

33:27.966 --> 33:29.468
But I am though.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.555
This whole mess is on me.

33:35.057 --> 33:38.060
Trapped in a tunnel,
surrounded by monsters.

33:38.060 --> 33:41.355
Nothing to eat and no way out.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.192
And I can't fix it.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.280
Should've listened to my mum.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.824
We'd all be better off
if I'd just stayed at home.

33:52.824 --> 33:55.536
Not me. Not Pen.

33:56.912 --> 33:59.164
Nothing I said
could get her out of the house.

33:59.665 --> 34:00.749
I mean nothing.

34:01.875 --> 34:02.918
But you did.

34:03.502 --> 34:04.503
You gave us hope.

34:05.254 --> 34:06.797
And look where it got her.

34:07.923 --> 34:11.426
Look, it doesn't matter, okay? Penny's
not the only one who needs rest right now.

34:11.426 --> 34:13.053
Why don't you join her?
I'll take first watch.

34:13.053 --> 34:16.348
No, I don't need to sleep.
I need to think.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.684
Take a walk.

34:19.184 --> 34:21.436
- Normally helps me.
- Yeah. Got it. Thanks.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.650
I'm sorry. I just wanna be alone.

34:26.650 --> 34:27.943
Fine. All good.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.213
Another couple of road flares.

34:48.714 --> 34:50.757
- How many does that make?
- Five.

34:51.550 --> 34:54.969
Plus two water bottles,
some biscuits and a tire iron.

34:55.512 --> 34:59.725
And some bungees and some climbing gear
from Mr. French Alps Holiday over there.

35:03.103 --> 35:06.148
No way we're going through this.
It's the end of the line.

35:06.148 --> 35:08.609
You find anything good? Pretty grim, eh?

35:09.693 --> 35:11.528
Yeah. Some biscuits, so--

35:11.528 --> 35:13.113
Oh, great. I'm starving.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.616
Hey! Emergencies only.

35:15.616 --> 35:17.618
Look around, mate.
It's the very definition.

35:17.618 --> 35:19.828
Alf, he's right. The path's blocked.

35:19.828 --> 35:22.039
There's no getting past that.

35:22.539 --> 35:25.125
And plus,
I'm pretty M-- Marvin anyway, so...

35:25.125 --> 35:27.628
Nice. Cozying up
with King Prick over here.

35:28.212 --> 35:31.298
When he used to torture you--
torture Caspar back at school,

35:31.298 --> 35:33.008
who was it that stuck up for you?

35:33.675 --> 35:34.843
- You did.
- Yeah.

35:35.427 --> 35:37.346
Whether I wanted you to or not.

35:39.431 --> 35:40.641
Excuse me?

35:40.641 --> 35:43.602
Look. Everything doesn't
have to be a fight, Alfie.

35:44.186 --> 35:47.397
We do things to survive. And yeah,
Monty was a bag of dicks back then,

35:47.397 --> 35:53.070
and he still can be sometimes,
but right now you're just as bad as him.

36:01.578 --> 36:02.829
Fine. Whatever.

36:03.622 --> 36:04.998
But I still don't trust you.

36:04.998 --> 36:09.753
- You think you know me so well, don't you?
- No, I don't at all. That's the problem.

36:09.753 --> 36:10.921
Fine.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.757
Ask me anything. Open book.

36:14.716 --> 36:15.801
Open book, eh?

36:17.845 --> 36:19.847
All right. "Kiss from a Rose."

36:20.430 --> 36:24.142
What's that '90s abomination doing
in your playlist?

36:24.142 --> 36:26.436
- Little Monty get his heart broken?
- None of your business.

36:27.896 --> 36:31.608
If you want trust, this is the price.

36:31.608 --> 36:34.403
Open fucking book
and I just picked the page.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.198
Fucking hell.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.708
It's my parents' song, okay?

36:50.127 --> 36:53.505
I used to watch them dance to it
when I was five or whatever.

36:54.464 --> 36:58.051
They used to smile at each other.
Like, real smiles.

36:58.886 --> 37:01.221
So, yeah. I play it sometimes

37:01.763 --> 37:06.310
'cause it reminds me that things--
things were actually good once.

37:09.563 --> 37:10.856
Happy now, twat?

37:46.850 --> 37:49.686
Fine. Walk it is.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.881
It's like the bus, isn't it?

38:21.468 --> 38:24.096
The one Mr. Edwards was driving
before the crash.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.975
Looked like a crushed-up fizzy drink can.

38:29.434 --> 38:30.644
We made it out alive.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.813
I'm dreaming again.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.483
Sort of.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.110
Yeah.

38:39.152 --> 38:40.696
So if I'm dreaming,

38:42.197 --> 38:43.657
where are you?

38:49.746 --> 38:50.831
I'm with them.

38:51.331 --> 38:52.332
Well,

38:53.375 --> 38:54.668
part of me is.

38:57.129 --> 39:02.259
Just after the hospital,
with you and that soldier, Trevante,

39:03.135 --> 39:04.803
I felt something pulling on me.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.930
It was like a--
It was like a compass needle.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.807
And I followed that pull,

39:10.017 --> 39:12.394
and it led me straight into their world.

39:14.313 --> 39:15.480
Into them.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.065
"Into them"?

39:17.816 --> 39:21.904
But just know I reached out to you
with everything I had.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.781
And here you are.

39:25.991 --> 39:27.075
I've been looking for you.

39:29.828 --> 39:30.954
Me too.

39:33.165 --> 39:34.499
I wanted to get out.

39:35.292 --> 39:36.627
I-- I thought I could.

39:38.629 --> 39:40.589
I think things got worse here.

39:40.589 --> 39:43.133
The radio said something about an attack.

39:43.842 --> 39:46.803
Maybe it worked. M-Maybe we hurt them.

39:46.803 --> 39:49.932
That's why the lights, they're flashing.
And the-- And-- And the sound--

39:49.932 --> 39:51.642
They must be right pissed.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.352
Whatever signal they're sending,

39:53.352 --> 39:55.604
I mean, they must be stronger because...

39:57.439 --> 39:59.191
- I can finally see you.
- See you.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.195
Don't you see what that means?

40:03.195 --> 40:05.197
You're still finding ways to get back.

40:06.365 --> 40:10.911
Get back to me.
Just like I'm finding my way to you.

40:12.412 --> 40:14.248
- You are?
- Yeah.

40:15.582 --> 40:17.584
If you're with them,
you can learn about them.

40:17.584 --> 40:21.296
About what they are,
how to fight them, how to finish them.

40:21.797 --> 40:24.633
Then, together,
we can get you back. All of you.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.719
You just gotta keep trying.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.305
I will if you will.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.478
I'm not giving up.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.231
Ever.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.781
Hey, Monty. Monty.

40:48.448 --> 40:50.659
- What is it?
- You have a good sense of direction, yeah?

40:50.659 --> 40:51.743
"Turn left, turn right"?

40:52.327 --> 40:53.912
Yeah. Yeah.

40:53.912 --> 40:55.372
Time to fix this.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.798
Monty!

41:49.259 --> 41:51.261
Monty, where are you?

41:51.261 --> 41:53.972
Alfie! Alfie! Alfie!

41:53.972 --> 41:57.100
- What? What happened?
- They're coming. I heard them.

41:59.561 --> 42:01.146
Someone's gone through my things.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.689
I knew it. What did he take?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.441
- Climbing gear.
- What?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.318
You're up. Good.

42:07.236 --> 42:08.237
'Cause we're leaving.

42:08.237 --> 42:09.863
Come on, guys.

42:12.491 --> 42:17.579
See? It's a path through all this mess.
Just follow the rope and mind the glass.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.248
He had to break some windows.

42:19.248 --> 42:20.332
Monty!

42:21.667 --> 42:22.835
You did this?

42:22.835 --> 42:24.002
Yeah, I did.

42:24.795 --> 42:26.213
Ready?

42:26.213 --> 42:27.506
Great.

42:27.506 --> 42:28.674
Follow me, Pen.

43:21.351 --> 43:23.145
- Any cuts?
- I don't think so.

43:23.145 --> 43:24.897
All good? Okay.

43:29.401 --> 43:32.487
- They're coming. Let's go! Come on.
- Go, go, go.

43:41.914 --> 43:44.124
Did you notice we're running uphill?

43:44.124 --> 43:45.834
We must be near the end.

43:46.627 --> 43:47.628
Look!

43:50.339 --> 43:51.840
- Oh, no.
- What the hell?

43:53.550 --> 43:55.344
- Guys, please--
- Look at the walls.

43:55.886 --> 43:56.970
What?

44:00.307 --> 44:01.183
Jesus.

44:01.183 --> 44:03.894
Those are explosives. They're gonna
blow the entrance to the tunnel.

44:03.894 --> 44:05.521
- Oh, God.
- Fuck. Help!

44:05.521 --> 44:07.272
Help!

44:08.440 --> 44:10.484
Anyone! Please! Help! Please!

44:10.484 --> 44:11.902
Please! Please! Help!

44:12.778 --> 44:13.779
Anyone!

44:24.915 --> 44:25.832
Hey!

44:25.832 --> 44:29.586
Someone's in the tunnel!
Hey! Someone's in there!

44:29.586 --> 44:31.004
What are you talking about?

44:31.004 --> 44:31.964
It sounds like children, sir.

44:32.381 --> 44:34.591
I need six men, now!

44:45.018 --> 44:46.645
Oh, my God. There's someone there.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.480
- Come on.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

44:48.480 --> 44:49.773
Climb up! Climb up!

44:49.773 --> 44:51.066
Climb up! Get her up!

44:51.066 --> 44:53.235
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Pen, go.

44:53.235 --> 44:54.319
Go, go, go, go, go!

45:02.119 --> 45:04.037
- Monty!
- Clear the barricade!

45:04.037 --> 45:05.455
Hurry! Hurry!

45:05.455 --> 45:07.666
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on. I got you.

45:07.666 --> 45:08.876
Quick, they're coming!

45:11.378 --> 45:12.629
Ready the charges!

45:12.629 --> 45:13.881
- Darwin!
- Monty!

45:20.721 --> 45:21.597
On my signal!

45:23.974 --> 45:26.727
Three... two... one!

46:00.844 --> 46:02.471
All clear!

46:08.268 --> 46:12.231
Thanks, mate.

46:12.231 --> 46:13.857
- Yeah, welcome.
- Fuck.

46:13.857 --> 46:15.484
- Monty!
- Pen.

46:15.484 --> 46:18.487
- Hey. I thought you was dead in there.
- Yeah, I did too.

46:19.363 --> 46:21.281
- You all right?
- Fuck!

46:23.492 --> 46:26.453
- Nicked me. God.
- Fucking hell.

46:26.453 --> 46:27.538
Darwin.

46:28.205 --> 46:30.582
- Someone's coming.
- Medic. Medic!

46:30.582 --> 46:32.125
Come on. Pick him up.

46:32.125 --> 46:33.377
Go.

46:34.920 --> 46:37.130
Come on. You're gonna be fine, okay?

46:37.130 --> 46:39.341
Look, there's medics here.
They're gonna get you good.

46:39.341 --> 46:41.009
This lot's gonna fix you right up.

46:44.805 --> 46:46.181
All right, bro.

46:49.142 --> 46:53.897
- Casper. Find Caspar.
- What?

47:00.779 --> 47:02.990
We need to take him.

47:09.705 --> 47:13.000
- Is he--
- He's fine. He's gonna be fine.

47:13.542 --> 47:15.752
Hey, they're doctors.
They're gonna look after him.

47:15.752 --> 47:17.504
It's just a scratch, Pen. It's okay.

47:19.506 --> 47:20.841
What did he say?

47:21.884 --> 47:23.010
Let's go get Caspar.

47:30.309 --> 47:31.602
Well, let's go get him then.
