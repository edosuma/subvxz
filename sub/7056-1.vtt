of these resistance fighters
brought in.

31:50.568 --> 31:52.352
I was wondering
where you've been.

31:52.403 --> 31:54.988
It's always brighter
when you're here.

32:44.566 --> 32:46.751
You hear what happened?
What?

32:46.785 --> 32:48.502
I was raised to level six.
Did I tell you?

32:48.537 --> 32:50.955
That's great.

32:51.006 --> 32:55.075
Hey, if I share
something,

32:55.093 --> 32:57.295
you promise
you won't tell?

32:59.681 --> 33:02.466
Yeah.

33:02.517 --> 33:05.019
They found Agent Foster
in Amber.

33:05.053 --> 33:07.922
<i>Your superior</i>
<i>was a double agent.</i>

33:07.940 --> 33:09.607
<i>He was working</i>
<i>with the resistance.</i>

33:09.641 --> 33:12.810
<i>He was with someone</i>
<i>named William Bell.</i>

33:15.063 --> 33:17.264
What did they do
with him?

33:17.282 --> 33:20.868
That's above my pay grade.

33:20.903 --> 33:23.287
Ask Windmark yourself.

33:23.322 --> 33:26.791
<i>He'll certainly want to talk</i>
<i>to you about it.</i>

33:31.630 --> 33:34.966
These physics
in your mind,

33:35.000 --> 33:39.787
they are also
above your comprehension.

33:42.791 --> 33:45.810
What are the stones
utilized for?

33:45.844 --> 33:50.264
I don't...

33:50.298 --> 33:53.484
You must try.

33:53.518 --> 33:56.687
What are the stones?

33:56.738 --> 34:00.658
What is your plan
to defeat us?

34:00.692 --> 34:03.527
Let down the walls.

34:04.646 --> 34:09.750
I am your ally.

34:27.902 --> 34:29.270
Nice watch.

34:31.389 --> 34:34.558
And I want
his boots too.

34:34.609 --> 34:35.726
Hey.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.344
[Gunshot]

34:45.103 --> 34:46.036
[Gasps]

34:46.071 --> 34:48.406
What happened
to him?

34:48.456 --> 34:50.541
Occupational hazard.

34:50.574 --> 34:52.243
That's my girl.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.734
What, they need this
to breathe?

35:33.752 --> 35:35.920
<i>(Peter) Apparently.</i>
<i>This one's only temporary.</i>

35:35.954 --> 35:38.255
They're building a more
permanent one in Central Park.

35:38.290 --> 35:40.091
They don't like clean air.

35:40.125 --> 35:45.179
All right,
it's always the red wire.

35:45.213 --> 35:48.749
Unless it's the white wire.

35:48.767 --> 35:49.850
[Electronic beeping]

35:49.885 --> 35:52.636
That did it.
Let's go.

35:54.639 --> 35:59.276
Clearly,
we are done here.

35:59.311 --> 36:01.929
I must say,

36:01.947 --> 36:04.765
your brain will make
an excellent specimen.

36:06.785 --> 36:10.905
[Computerized female voice]
Air control malfunction.

36:10.939 --> 36:13.657
[Alarm blares]

36:13.708 --> 36:19.296
Air control malfunction.

36:19.331 --> 36:23.334
Air control malfunction.

36:23.385 --> 36:25.119
Walter.
Walter.

36:25.137 --> 36:27.304
Air control malfunction.
Walter.

36:27.339 --> 36:29.340
Is he okay?

36:29.391 --> 36:33.010
I don't know.
Air control malfunction.

36:35.397 --> 36:40.151
Air control malfunction.

36:40.185 --> 36:41.235
[Gunshots]

36:41.269 --> 36:44.105
Air control malfunction.

36:44.139 --> 36:47.658
[Alarm blaring]

36:47.692 --> 36:49.410
Air control malfunction.

36:49.444 --> 36:52.329
Over here.

36:52.364 --> 36:54.448
Peter.

36:58.153 --> 37:01.822
[Alarm bell ringing,
whooping]

37:15.220 --> 37:18.839
(Man)
To the front gate!

37:20.809 --> 37:22.860
Oh, my God, Walter.

37:31.486 --> 37:34.038
Afro...

37:34.072 --> 37:37.708
Do you have
any music?

37:55.093 --> 37:57.811
Hello, little girl.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.700
Olivia.

38:09.735 --> 38:13.954
I am so happy
you're alive.

38:13.989 --> 38:15.873
Walter,
do you recognize this?

38:15.907 --> 38:18.125
It's what September
wanted you to find.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.077
<i>It's called</i>
<i>a Thought Unifier.</i>

38:20.128 --> 38:22.913
Or at least it was.
This one's long since dead.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.717
[Electronic beeping]

38:28.136 --> 38:30.971
He must have designed it
specifically for you.

38:31.006 --> 38:32.423
What's it used for?

38:32.474 --> 38:34.809
Well, it's meant to collect
and make sense

38:34.843 --> 38:37.061
of the scrambled plan
that September put in your mind.

38:37.095 --> 38:41.348
What plan?

38:43.551 --> 38:46.404
<i>You told us</i>
<i>that you knew</i>

38:46.438 --> 38:48.406
all the parts of the plan,
all the elements.

38:48.440 --> 38:51.525
You just weren't sure what they
were supposed to be used for.

38:51.559 --> 38:54.995
Walter,
do you remember this?

38:56.948 --> 39:00.000
Whose hand is that?

39:00.035 --> 39:04.088
It's William Bell's hand.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.957
You're out
of your mind.

39:07.008 --> 39:11.011
Why would we have
William Bell's hand?

39:11.046 --> 39:12.596
You said we needed
his handprint

39:12.631 --> 39:15.299
so we could get access to one
of his storage facilities.

39:18.854 --> 39:21.421
I don't remember it.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.941
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>any of it.</i>

39:23.975 --> 39:28.446
I've failed myself,
and I've failed the world.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.197
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

39:30.232 --> 39:33.150
What has happened to--
Walter.

39:39.991 --> 39:42.576
I can't do it.

39:42.610 --> 39:46.464
I can't even
recognize myself.

39:51.269 --> 39:54.805
[Door closes]

39:54.840 --> 39:58.592
It's like there's nothing left
to unify.

39:58.626 --> 40:00.227
All the parts are gone.

40:00.262 --> 40:02.847
Or they took them.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.018
It's more likely
they were destroyed

40:08.069 --> 40:10.187
when he was fighting it.

40:10.238 --> 40:12.740
Will they ever heal?

40:15.327 --> 40:17.644
No.

40:17.662 --> 40:21.115
The plan is gone.
