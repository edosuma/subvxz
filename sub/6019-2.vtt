00:11.080 --> 00:12.115
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.670
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.829
Really? What happened?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.911
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building--

00:19.080 --> 00:20.957
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.998
-ls he the one with the show on cable?
-Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.391
So I spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...

00:27.560 --> 00:30.028
...and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.634
-That's great.
-I know.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.952
-That looks pretty good.
-He's in.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.000
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.197
-What's to discuss?
-Come on. George is getting married.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.554
Is he happy?

01:01.480 --> 01:03.869
I will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.669
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?

01:07.840 --> 01:10.559
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.592
Isn't that why we have locks
on the doors?

01:12.760 --> 01:15.513
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...

01:15.680 --> 01:17.432
...you can see if it's taken.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.670
A backup system?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.549
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...

01:22.720 --> 01:25.632
...in anticipation
of the locks not working?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.876
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.917
Can we change the subject, please?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.310
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?

01:34.480 --> 01:37.552
No, fine. If you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.951
It's not that I wanna keep
talking about it.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.317
I just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.

01:43.480 --> 01:46.233
Well, I didn't think
that it had any momentum.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.592
How am I gonna do this?

01:49.760 --> 01:53.116
I'm engaged to this woman?
She doesn't even like me.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.238
Change the subject?
Toilets were the subject.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.994
We don't even share
the same interests.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.193
-Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
-Well, that's all that counts, I guess.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.399
What's the matter?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.551
What? Nothing.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.954
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.792
Well, what do you want me to do?

02:18.960 --> 02:21.428
I thought you'd have
some reaction to it.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.592
Well, I don't.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.032
I think maybe you're a little jealous.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.998
Oh, what, you think
I wanna marry George?

02:32.160 --> 02:35.311
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.472
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that I want.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.631
Oh, yeah. Right.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.233
Yeah, right.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.676
-Laney.
-Jerry.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.956
-You don't wanna get married?
-Yeah, that's right.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.872
-I don't wanna get married.
-Oh, come on.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.632
-Oh, you come on.
-It's such--

02:51.800 --> 02:52.789
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.236
Hey, Elaine, listen, I was talking
to a friend about this dog business.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.075
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?

03:00.240 --> 03:01.593
Are you aware of this?

03:02.080 --> 03:04.150
-Oh, dear.
-lt can never be erased.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.357
It'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.479
I'll never be able to get a job.
I mean, doesn't that concern you?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.519
Everything I've worked for,
down the drain...

03:14.680 --> 03:16.318
...because of one stupid mistake.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.278
I mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.158
-We gotta change the system.
-Yes!

03:21.320 --> 03:23.276
I could care less.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.717
I hope it is on our record.
I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.590
-Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
-Elaine.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.512
Always a pleasure to see you.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.594
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.594
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...

03:48.760 --> 03:51.638
...and just as often
there are solutions.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.833
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.199
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if I may say, troubled.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.991
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.870
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.228
Hey.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.197
I want your honest opinion
about something.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.238
-Have I ever been less than forthright?
-No, you haven't.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.755
Well, maybe you have.
What do I know?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.593
I probably have. Of course I have.
What am I talking about?

04:19.760 --> 04:22.877
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea;

04:23.040 --> 04:26.828
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...

04:27.000 --> 04:28.149
...all the way to the floor.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.873
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?

04:34.040 --> 04:36.235
Door comes down,
hides your feet.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.949
-Yes, I like it. I like it a lot.
-It's good, right?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.873
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's a fantastic idea.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.314
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.756
Well, I told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.635
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me;

04:50.800 --> 04:52.119
"Can we change the subject?"

04:52.280 --> 04:54.111
-See, now, that I don't care for.
-Right.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.794
I mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.871
It should resolve of its own volition.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.554
That's exactly what I said,
but I used the word "momentum."

05:01.720 --> 05:04.439
-"Momentum," same thing.
-Same thing.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.748
My God, I'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.679
Yeah, I know.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.274
How am I gonna make December?
I need a little more time.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.839
Look at me,
I'm a nervous wreck.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.309
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. I can't turn.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.550
Look, look.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.757
-You're turning.
-No, that's not a good turn.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.990
December! December!

05:24.160 --> 05:27.357
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?

05:28.040 --> 05:30.076
If you need more time,
you should have more time.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.278
-What, you think I could postpone it?
-Sure you can. Why not?

05:33.440 --> 05:36.318
-You're allowed to postpone?
-I don't see why not.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.350
-So I could do that?
-Sure, go ahead.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.550
All right. All right.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.870
I'll tell you what, how about this?
I got the date.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.315
March 21st, the first day of spring.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.948
-Spring, of course.
-You know, spring.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.998
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.957
All that crap.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.633
Beautiful.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.957
-She's not gonna like it.
-No, she's not.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.680
You know, I think
I'm a little bit scared of her.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.350
She's 5'3", like 100 pounds,
I'm frightened to death of her.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.509
Well, she's a woman.
They don't like to be disappointed.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.398
Especially her.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.028
She does not like disappointment.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.549
Well, I have to do it.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.790
I can't make December.
No way I can make December.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.871
You can see that, right?
I mean, look at me.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.715
Can I make December? I can't
make December, right? Look! Look!

06:30.880 --> 06:33.474
-Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
-March 21st.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.756
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.718
-Oh, all the way.
-You are a good friend.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.758
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, I wouldn't turn you in.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.751
Is that so?

06:45.920 --> 06:49.196
Hey, Kramer, if I killed somebody,
would you turn me in?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.717
Definitely.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.028
-You're kidding.
-No, no, I would turn you in.

06:56.360 --> 07:00.148
-You would turn me in?
-I wouldn't even think about it.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.836
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.833
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.831
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.878
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say I wouldn't be next?

07:11.040 --> 07:14.077
-But you know me.
-I thought I did.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.514
I really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.275
You know, I'm not of your faith.
In fact, I'm not a very religious person.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.911
But I do feel as if I'm in need
of some guidance here.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.072
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?

07:33.440 --> 07:36.637
I have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...

07:36.800 --> 07:40.554
...although I think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...

07:40.720 --> 07:45.714
...people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.589
No. No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.751
Anyway...

07:52.920 --> 07:56.310
...this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.311
-How wonderful.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.758
Well, for some reason...

08:03.920 --> 08:06.878
...well, I find myself
just overcome...

08:07.040 --> 08:09.998
...with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.550
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...

08:13.720 --> 08:16.598
...enter into this holiest of unions?

08:16.760 --> 08:18.955
No, no. No, it doesn't.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.274
No joy. No joy whatsoever. It just--
The whole thing makes me...

08:23.440 --> 08:25.078
...sick.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.879
You know, Elaine...

08:28.040 --> 08:31.635
...very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.756
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.438
Well, for example,
say there's a forest--

08:37.600 --> 08:41.751
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.

08:41.919 --> 08:45.754
You know? I'm smart.
I'm attractive.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.435
You know, my temple
has many single functions.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.999
Oh, no, that's okay.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.870
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps I could...?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.599
No, I don't think so.

08:57.760 --> 09:02.311
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.072
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.118
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.834
-Another caffe latte?
-Yeah, you better believe it.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.436
-Since when are you so trendy?
-Hey, baby, I set the trends.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.636
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.756
I don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.275
I've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...

09:22.440 --> 09:23.589
...and haven't looked back.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.115
Look, Plan 9 from Outer Space
is playing tomorrow night.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.191
-One show only.
-I've always wanted to see it.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.157
I was supposed to see this
five years ago.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.550
I was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.153
We got screwed up
and missed it.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.833
-Well, let's do it, huh?
-All right.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.197
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.952
See, that's littering.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.350
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.592
Maybe I will.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.271
-Hi.
-Hey, how was your day?

09:53.440 --> 09:55.032
Good. Good day.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.919
-How was--? How was your day?
-Oh, it was okay.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.080
-So, what's going on?
-Oh, nothing much.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.550
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.917
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.559
The Lauers? Really?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.632
-Do you not wanna go?
-No, no. I wanna go.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.155
So, what did Jerry have to say?

10:15.320 --> 10:18.949
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.832
I had an unbelievable idea
today.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.070
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.674
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
It's something else.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.114
-You ready for this?
-Yeah.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.508
-Okay, how about this?
-What?

10:35.680 --> 10:36.749
-All right.
-Okay.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.196
We get married...

10:39.360 --> 10:41.828
...March 21st,
the first day of spring.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.549
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?

10:44.720 --> 10:46.870
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.077
I just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.915
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that--

10:54.400 --> 10:59.520
If you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!

10:59.680 --> 11:01.079
No, no, still marry. Still marry.

11:01.240 --> 11:05.358
-No, you don't love me.
-No, no, still love. Still love.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.876
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...

11:08.040 --> 11:11.316
-...and that I was making a mistake.
-No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.436
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.558
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. It's fine, really.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.109
-You sure?
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.

11:19.280 --> 11:23.512
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.075
Let me take a guess.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.434
She cried and you caved.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.190
-How did you know that?
-I live and breathe, my friend.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.432
I live and breathe.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.717
I felt terrible. I thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.077
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.071
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.673
You gotta build up your immunity.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.070
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.038
It's like she was on fire.
I was just trying to put her out.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.833
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.875
I didn't have any sex.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.550
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?

12:05.720 --> 12:08.075
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.558
I missed out on the make-up sex.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.909
In your situation...

12:14.080 --> 12:16.640
...the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...

12:16.800 --> 12:19.712
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.995
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.

12:29.240 --> 12:33.995
Look, I can tell you're very upset,
but I'm sorry, I'm not going.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.073
Did you hear that?

12:38.600 --> 12:42.798
I can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.269
Are you gonna eat those fries?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.474
This is amazing.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.719
Thank you. Thank you very much.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.108
I'm going back in.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.919
Feel better.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.757
Poor bastard.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.719
Good evening, Rabbi.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.314
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.072
Well, Rabbi. Well.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.754
I trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.230
-Yeah, that's right.
-I hope she's feeling better.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.634
What do you mean?

13:25.800 --> 13:27.597
-She didn't tell you?
-No.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.953
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...

13:31.120 --> 13:33.429
...has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.189
-ls that so?
-Oh, yes.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.271
In fact, she told me
that she wishes...

13:39.440 --> 13:41.670
...she was the one
who was getting married.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.799
Really?

13:43.960 --> 13:47.509
-She came off as pretty desperate.
-I didn't know any of this.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.673
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.

13:51.840 --> 13:56.436
I recall the word "loser" peppered
throughout our conversation.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.511
Well, this all comes as news to me.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.271
-Hi.
-Hi, how was your day?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.873
Good. Good day.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.793
-How was your day?
-Oh, it was okay.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.192
-So, what's going on?
-Oh, nothing much, you know.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.636
I went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.548
Could l--?
Could I talk to you for a minute?

14:24.720 --> 14:26.199
Yeah, sure.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.833
All right.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.192
You see, this is the thing.

14:37.480 --> 14:41.109
I just feel like I can't do this
in December.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.398
I just feel like I need a little more time
because I feel like I'm not ready yet.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.154
I'm frightened and I'm scared.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.519
And I just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.672
But I could do it in March.
I promise. I promise.

14:58.840 --> 15:02.230
No more postponements. I just
need three more months, please.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.960
Oh, George, George.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.394
Of course.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.870
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.429
-Yeah?
-Oh, don't worry.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.559
Yes, of course, of course.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.352
I have that magazine article for you.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.669
You know, I had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.910
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.753
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.638
Yeah, we talked earlier.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.394
Yes, I know, I know.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.876
-What does that mean?
-Nothing. Nothing.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.675
-He didn't mention...?
-Yes, he did.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.674
-He told you about the conversation?
-Oh, we had quite a little chat.

15:54.840 --> 15:58.355
-He told you about--?
-Yes, how you are jealous of George.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.875
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.553
He told you that? How could he?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.359
And it didn't take much
prodding either, I have to say.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.398
-Can he do that?
-He did.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.155
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.072
That's what's so fascinating.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.076
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.276
-They'll never let you in with it.
-Why not?

16:20.440 --> 16:23.352
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.353
-Well, that's stupid.
-That's the rule.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.432
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.830
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.510
-So nice to see you again.
-Yeah.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.911
Can I offer you some
kasha varnishkes?

16:44.080 --> 16:47.356
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
I'd like to ask you a question.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.433
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what I talked to you about?

16:51.600 --> 16:56.230
-Was that a problem for you?
-Of course it was problem for me!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.677
You didn't--? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?

16:59.840 --> 17:01.751
Well, let's see....

17:02.440 --> 17:07.275
I seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1F.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.429
Mrs. Winston?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.030
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...

17:11.200 --> 17:13.555
...and I happened to mention
to her...

17:13.720 --> 17:16.473
...how you felt it was never
going to "happen" for you.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.156
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?

17:22.480 --> 17:23.469
Don Ramsey?

17:23.640 --> 17:26.676
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?

17:26.839 --> 17:28.478
Oh, him.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.950
Well, this morning I happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.076
Oh, my God, you didn't.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.113
Excuse me.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.277
Pardon me. Excuse us.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.073
My coffee!

17:54.160 --> 17:56.628
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?

17:56.800 --> 17:57.915
Nothing. Nothing.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.799
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?

18:00.960 --> 18:03.952
I don't have anything. What?
Ask him.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.592
All right. Come on, coffee boy.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.194
-What?
-Come on, now. Here we go.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.039
I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.111
I ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...

18:19.280 --> 18:21.635
...I mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.515
Elaine, if I could say a word here
about the Jewish people.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.114
That man in no way
represents our ability...

18:30.280 --> 18:34.068
...to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.992
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.354
No.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.478
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.599
-Feelings of resentment, hostility.
-Yeah, yeah. So what?

18:45.240 --> 18:50.394
-Hey.
-Georgie, congratulations!

18:50.560 --> 18:54.314
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you
since it happened.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.914
I couldn't be happier for you.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.708
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.351
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.672
Deserve?
I don't know about deserve.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.829
Are you kidding?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.798
I have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.748
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.837
Yeah, I guess I'm getting older.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.795
Well, I just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.

19:19.960 --> 19:24.397
I've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.788
My most just...

19:25.960 --> 19:28.315
-...heartfelt congratulations.
-Yeah, thanks.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.913
Listen, if you ever get a date...

19:30.080 --> 19:32.594
...maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.238
Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.073
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?

19:39.240 --> 19:41.435
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?

19:41.600 --> 19:43.636
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.959
-Boy, she is something, isn't she?
-Yeah, she's something else.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.509
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or...?

19:50.680 --> 19:54.878
-Nope. I wept like a baby.
-What?

19:55.040 --> 19:58.157
Well, I started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...

19:58.320 --> 20:00.072
...I just burst into tears.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.674
-You cried?
-I bawled uncontrollably.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.355
I just poured my guts out. And
I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.029
I never realized how powerful
these tears are.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.476
I could have postponed it
another five years if I wanted to.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.035
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.589
Sorry about that movie thing.
I was joking around.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.193
Sorry? Are you kidding?

20:18.360 --> 20:19.998
You did me the biggest favour
of my life.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.869
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.999
-Suing? What for?
-The coffee was too hot.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.077
-It's supposed to be hot.
-Not that hot.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.478
The prophet lsaiah tells us
that without friends...

20:43.640 --> 20:46.552
...our lives are empty
and meaningless.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.996
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.355
I just met this guy the other day.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.115
A young lady I know,
let's call her Elaine...

21:00.320 --> 21:02.959
...happened to find herself
overwhelmed...

21:03.120 --> 21:07.079
...with feelings of resentment
and hostility for her friend...

21:07.240 --> 21:08.878
... Iet's call him George.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.038
She felt that George
was somewhat of a loser...

21:14.600 --> 21:19.037
...and that she was the one
who deserved to be married first.

21:19.360 --> 21:24.070
She also happened to mention to me
that her friend had wondered...

21:24.240 --> 21:29.109
...if going to a prostitute while you're
engaged is considered cheating.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.352
His feeling was...

21:34.520 --> 21:36.556
... they're never going
to see each other again...

21:36.720 --> 21:38.915
...so, what's the difference?

21:39.440 --> 21:42.989
But that is a subject
for another sermon.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.869
And now I'd like to close
with a psalm.
