<i>Go away!</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:19.686
<i>Go away!</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:27.736
The sign says don't knock
for crying out...

00:37.787 --> 00:40.415

01:17.786 --> 01:18.995
Oh, come on, man.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.288
You can't come back to me
with that.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.664
We've already been there.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.166
Let's take this up a notch.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.417
How's it going?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.252
- I'm crushing it.
- I'm on it.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.128
No.

01:27.128 --> 01:27.921
No, no, no.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.089
- Hey Tim.
- Birdie.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.465
- Paula.
- How'd the Lancaster call go?

01:30.465 --> 01:31.841
It actually got pushed
‘til tomorrow.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.760
You let me know if you need
any help with that.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.095
We're all rooting for you.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.180
I think I got it covered
but I'll let you know.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.640
You got everything there, Paula?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.225
Always do.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.105
Just a heads up, the Lancaster
call got pushed ‘til tomorrow.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.731
Oh. They're stalling.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.733
Which means you've got them
right where you want them.

01:48.733 --> 01:49.734
I know.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.902
I can taste it.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.825
Birdie, bird.

01:56.825 --> 01:57.992
I'm outta here.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.411
Gotta get that step count up.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.288
Oh, you're so good.
You ready for tomorrow?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.124
Me? I was born ready.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.334
I'll tell you what, tomorrow
I will get the coffee.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.419
Yeah?

02:07.419 --> 02:08.169
Deal.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.713
- The ushe?
- The ushe.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.630
You know me.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.131
Of course I do.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.639
Hey babe!

02:34.029 --> 02:35.363
Okay.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.908
Deal me in, boys.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.328
Good evening.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.580
I'm Trisha Murata and tonight
authorities believe

02:43.580 --> 02:47.709
a 30-year-mystery has finally
come to an end.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.671
Just hours ago at this
construction site behind me,

02:51.671 --> 02:55.175
workers discovered the body
of famed Boston crime boss

02:55.175 --> 02:57.510
Orleans “Lean” McGuiness.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.930
McGuiness had been on the top
of the FBI's most wanted list

03:00.930 --> 03:02.557
for over two decades.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.017
Well dumping him
at a construction site

03:04.017 --> 03:06.353
has mob written all over it.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.606
Seems kinda cliché.
Don't you think?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.066
This is real life.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.901
Not an article in
<i>The New Yorker</i>.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.861
Oh. So you can read?

03:21.326 --> 03:23.203
Careful there, glasses.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.081
Most of us swim in these waters
on a regular basis.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.708
You haven't even gotten
your feet wet.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.085
Alright.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.253
Are we gonna finish class
or argue about the news?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.930
Don't worry about him.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.059
The ability to use various
equipment and technologies

03:46.059 --> 03:48.019
and a thorough knowledge
of the law

03:48.019 --> 03:52.315
are some of the key skills
a private investigator needs.

03:52.315 --> 03:56.611
Now, who can tell me what
sub rosa means?

03:58.947 --> 03:59.989
Yes.

04:00.949 --> 04:01.991
Um, it's Latin for...

04:05.120 --> 04:06.663
It's Latin for...

04:08.081 --> 04:09.582
For under the rose.
It's a...

04:10.625 --> 04:11.751
It's a term that
investigators use

04:11.751 --> 04:12.961
when they wanna do something
in secret.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.462
Alright.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.757
This week's assignment,
it's gonna be a little more fun.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.925
Surveillance.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.427
Yeah.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.846
I need all of you to surveil
someone from your life.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.347
A few rules.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.640
Don't get caught.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.560
Don't follow your wife.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.895
Don't follow your boss.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.898
And definitely don't follow
your ex-wife.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.945
I take it you haven't
told her yet.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.447
I'm working on it.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.949
So that's a no.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.409
Yeah, well...

04:44.409 --> 04:47.912
with Birdie, it's all about
finding the right time.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.207
What are you afraid of?

04:51.207 --> 04:54.336
Inflation. Carcinogens.
Murder hornets.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.713
Teenagers on skateboards.
Pretty much everything.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.758
But the thing that I'm afraid of
the most...

04:59.758 --> 05:02.594
is that look of disappointment
on my wife's face.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.223
You could be an incredible
private investigator.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.559
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.479
And I'd hate to see all that
potential go to the wayside

05:12.479 --> 05:16.191
because you were afraid of
disappointing your wife.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.150
I know.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.193
You have to tell her.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.736
I will.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.445
Soon.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.238
Soon is upon us.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.490
Huh?

05:24.699 --> 05:25.533
Soon.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.951
See ya.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.379
Oh. Oh, so that's how
it's gonna be.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.048
I don't think you got it
Lizard King 784.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.216
You're bluffing.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.021
Hey.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.773
Hey babe.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.899
How was class?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.485
Oh, you know, fascinating.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.154
We're learning all
about bankruptcy.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.657
Oh. So you're on chapter
11 then.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.535
Uh, no. Actually, we're
on chapter 4 but...

06:09.953 --> 06:11.037
I see what you did there.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.789
Mmhmm. Mmhmm.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.006
Yes! Eat it.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.590
Eat what now?

06:22.590 --> 06:26.052
Oh. I, um... got you
some new granola.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.387
- Nice!
- Yeah.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.847
The one I like
with the pistachios?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.682
Yeah. Uh huh.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.022
Did you get up
to anything fun tonight?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.648
Oh, you know.

06:38.648 --> 06:43.611
Just, um... a couple of briefs
and, uh, getting my Sudoku on.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.654
Uh huh.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.449
Yeah. Just a wild
and crazy night.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.204
Actually, um...
you know there's something

06:53.204 --> 06:56.332
I kinda wanted to talk
to you about.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.710
Oh. Okay.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.713
What is it?

07:02.797 --> 07:03.923
I...

07:05.884 --> 07:09.929
Uh... read that, um...
the article that you sent me.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.473
And you know what?
I think you're right.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.683
I think I should be taking
a daily probiotic.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.226
You read the article
I sent you?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.479
Thank you.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.064
I know it's not everyone's
favorite topic.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.190
Well...

07:20.190 --> 07:21.107
But if we're gonna grow
old together

07:21.107 --> 07:22.650
we cannot ignore our gut health.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.278
I mean, the balance of good
and bad bacteria are crucial.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.363
It's crucial.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.864
Crucial.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.247
Yeah.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.634
This initial offer
is unacceptable,
is just unacceptable.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.635
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.929
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.432
I made you a little breakfast.
Your favorite.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.310
Um, I was hoping we could
have a chat.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.770
This is so amazing

07:58.770 --> 08:00.355
but I actually have the
Lancaster call this morning.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.356
Can I take a rain check?

08:01.356 --> 08:02.816
A rain check.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.817
Uh... sure.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.818
Great.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.445
Uh, well. But how about...
a latte?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.947
I love this little heart.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.323
It's a little heart.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.700
Oh, you know what?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.869
Kyle... Kyle was grabbing
coffees on his way in.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.579
But I feel so bad that you
went through all this trouble.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.164
I mean, I...

08:18.164 --> 08:19.332
I'm gonna take a little sip.
I'm gonna take a little sip.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.835
That's okay.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
- I'm totally fine with that.
- Wait, I have to take this.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.671
Kyle! I was just talking
about you.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.840
You ready to crush it?
I'll see you tonight.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.091
Hey...

08:28.091 --> 08:29.676
You literally
finished my sentence,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.094
that is exactly what
I was thinking.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.805
We are so on the same page.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.146
Just make something up ‘cause
I don't wanna talk to him now.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.356
Yo! Yo, the bird looking sharp.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.733
You ready for this?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.651
Breaking necks
and cashing checks.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.069
Thank you very much.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.700
Mmm! Cinnamon.
Living on the edge.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.076
Game time.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.749
The case
of famed Boston crime boss

09:00.749 --> 09:03.710
Orleans McGuiness continues
to unfold.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.961
Police are now reporting

09:04.961 --> 09:08.256
that this is an active
homicide investigation.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.550
And that's the news
for this hour.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.637
Coming up, a rare B-side from
the late Danny “Teardrops” Page.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.848
Paid in full.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.268
Okay, Gambot 200.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.607
It is time for you to go
to your forever home.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.945
You know, I think you're gonna
like Cincinnati.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.823
Terrible chili but the people
are great.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.745
Godspeed old friend.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.920
Oh Kyle, your coffee's so great.
Is that cardamom in there?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.963
Does everything you touch
smell like unicorns?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.320
Our position
from the beginning

10:12.320 --> 10:15.156
was to have this resolved
in a reasonable fashion.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.324
We understand that.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.118
We believe 3.5 is
more than reasonable.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.661
You know three
million was our ceiling.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.745
No. Up, up.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.580
Now you have a new ceiling.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.249
Our
client does not think
anything over three million

10:24.249 --> 10:26.001
is in their best interest.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.795
That's fine.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.674
We can always see
what a jury thinks.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.177
Fine.
We'll make 3.5 work.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.722
Great. We'll send over
the paperwork this afternoon.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.350
Dream team strikes again.
Huh, huh?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.229
Yes!

10:46.229 --> 10:47.355
Where'd we land?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.481
3.5.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.482
And on the first round.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.608
Yes.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.028
But didn't they start at three?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.614
Paula, can you get the
champagne from my fridge?

10:56.614 --> 10:58.825
This calls for a celebration.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.453
Thank you so much, Tim.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.079
These paralegals.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.414
They file two forms, they think
they're Erin Brockovich.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.000
Ms. Case?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.002
Ms. Perez would like to see you
in her office in five minutes.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.587
Well, I guess, good news
travels fast.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.921
As it should.
She's gonna love this.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.465
This is how you make partner.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.632
I'm grabbing
the expensive stuff.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.592
Uh huh.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.678
- Well done.
- Thank you, Tim.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.096
That's how you do it.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.682
Thank you Leslie.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.933
Teamwork, right?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.810
Teamwork makes the dream work.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.855
We did it.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.815
Shut the door.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.072
What was that?

11:37.072 --> 11:39.199
This is not how
you make partner.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.534
We got them half a million
dollars over their ceiling.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.412
$3.5 million is a disgrace.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.872
3.5 is fair.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.875
We are not in the business
of fair.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.210
We are in the business
of extracting

11:50.210 --> 11:53.672
everything we can
until there is nothing left.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.673
Kyle and I thought that this...

11:54.673 --> 11:55.882
Listen...

11:57.217 --> 11:58.385
I like Kyle.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.680
He's a good worker bee.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.015
But making partner
isn't in his future.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.351
It is in yours so long
as you pull it together

12:06.351 --> 12:08.144
and start acting like a killer.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.270
But Mom...

12:09.270 --> 12:12.982
I am not your mom
when we're at work.

12:12.982 --> 12:17.320
I am your boss.
And I need you to step up.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.571
Understood?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.989
Understood.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.517
Krshnit?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.937
Oh... crushing it.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.656
11:27 AM.

13:01.656 --> 13:06.286
Target said vehicle identified.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.954
Brotastic.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.054
Hey babe.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.180
Hey.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.307
How did the, uh...
how did the call go?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.558
Fine.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.809
Was your mom pleased?

13:29.809 --> 13:33.646
My boss wasn't exactly
thrilled, no.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.607
What's new?

13:36.649 --> 13:41.321
Um... hey, uh... so, uh...
I'm thinking about, you know,

13:41.321 --> 13:45.367
going with some of the guys
to happy hour tonight.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.618
Um...

13:46.618 --> 13:48.495
Hey. I'm out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.996
Okay. Those are gross.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.581
Uh, no. I'm good.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.626
Okay. Well, don't wait up.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.252
You know how hard CPAs
like to party.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.212
Mmhmm.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.922
Okay. Bye.

14:36.626 --> 14:42.632
Dry cleaning. 5:10 PM.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.824
I'm Kyle.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.535
I like to do five K's
just for fun.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.097
Goodnight, Tim.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.849
Oh, Birdie. Good night.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.559
I didn't think anybody
was still here.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.269
You're taking off soon?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.562
Tonight feels like one of
those nights

15:37.562 --> 15:38.605
I'm never gonna leave.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.981
Ugh, I hear you.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.610
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.197
Hey. Today was still a win.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.531
I know Eleonore can be tough

15:48.531 --> 15:51.493
but you did right
by your client today.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.952
That's the best we can do.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.455
I don't know. Sometimes
I just question it all.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.123
We all do.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.709
You just gotta live
to fight another day.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.129
Thanks Tim,
that means a lot.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.923
Get outta here. Good night.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.347
This is Tim speaking.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.647
A new suit.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.148
Fancy boy.

16:26.528 --> 16:27.696
My name's Kyle.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.823
I don't need to wear
a seat belt.

16:47.757 --> 16:51.219
I'm Kyle.
I work 18 hours a day.

17:02.772 --> 17:08.403
Three... Five... ugh.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.424
What the?

17:29.424 --> 17:30.592
Come on.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.427
Ugh!

17:38.600 --> 17:42.145
<i>I|m Kyle, I run out of
buildings at full speed.</i>

17:43.772 --> 17:45.565
Guess I'm going in.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.447
Hello?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.452
Hello?

18:07.462 --> 18:08.505
Barf.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.385
What's that all about?

18:27.524 --> 18:28.650
Divorce?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.535
Hello?

18:41.913 --> 18:43.415
Somebody here?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.683
Tim?

19:08.690 --> 19:11.818
Oh no! Oh no!!

19:11.818 --> 19:12.694
Freeze!

19:14.362 --> 19:15.864
Let me see your hands.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.365
It's not what you think.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.076
How do you know what I think?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.078
Yeah.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.249
Eww.

19:35.925 --> 19:36.968
Ah.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.430
Your blood pressure's
a little high.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.931
You been under
any stress lately?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.102
Slightly more than usual, yeah.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.742
Mr. Case... let me
get this straight.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.244
You followed a Mr. Henicker, Kyle,

20:03.244 --> 20:07.248
back to the office because
you were "doing homework"

20:07.248 --> 20:11.086
for your "private
investigation class"

20:11.086 --> 20:14.589
‘cause he bought
your wife "coffee".

20:14.589 --> 20:16.007
Did I miss anything?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.218
I don't appreciate your liberal
use of air quotes

20:18.218 --> 20:22.639
but aside from that,
it's correct, yeah.

20:22.639 --> 20:23.848
Alden?

20:24.516 --> 20:25.892
Oh.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.060
Are you okay?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.061
Yeah.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.522
Is that Tim?

20:30.522 --> 20:31.439
Yeah.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.443
Wait, what are you doing here?

20:35.443 --> 20:37.445
Err... I...

20:46.621 --> 20:48.248
Say something.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.712
A few hours ago Tim was giving
me some really kind advice

20:53.712 --> 20:58.174
and then I got in my car
and I drove home

20:58.174 --> 21:01.511
thinking that my husband
was out networking

21:01.511 --> 21:03.013
with other aspiring accountants

21:03.013 --> 21:05.306
because that's what
he told me he was doing.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.266
Yeah.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.893
And now Tim is dead

21:08.893 --> 21:14.149
and my husband has been lying
to me for four months.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.151
Four months about where
he spends his nights.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.820
I... I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.156
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out this way.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.742
I... I was... I was trying
to tell you this morning

21:23.742 --> 21:25.744
and then you...
you rushed out.

21:25.744 --> 21:28.329
To work, Alden!
I had to get to work.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.456
That's not fair.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.625
You're right.
You're right.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.169
I thought we agreed.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.004
I thought we agreed that
accounting was stable

21:36.004 --> 21:37.964
and consistent which is
what we need for you

21:37.964 --> 21:40.091
after your whole crypto
currency debacle.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.801
You promised that
you would play it safe.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.970
Okay. All of the blogs said
that crypto mining

21:43.970 --> 21:45.847
was a solid investment.

21:45.847 --> 21:48.016
But we are still paying it off, Alden.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.185
You promised!
You promised!

21:50.185 --> 21:51.353
I know.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.354
That you would find
something reliable.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.980
I know.

21:53.980 --> 21:59.110
And... and I tried accounting.
I just couldn't do it.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.445
And then across the hall

22:00.445 --> 22:03.114
they had this Intro to Private Investigation.

22:03.114 --> 22:06.951
So I went over and, I don't
know, something clicked.

22:09.037 --> 22:12.832
Accounting is just not my thing.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.209
It's just not your thing?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.836
Alden, this isn't a college
job fair.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.962
Okay.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.134
I really don't wanna be the wife
that nags you all the time.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.135
I don't.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.055
I love you but I just...

22:28.598 --> 22:31.059
you keep making promises

22:33.186 --> 22:35.063
and then you break them.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.946
Okay. Uh...

22:45.782 --> 22:46.741
Going good.
There we go.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.077
Oh. Okay.
No. No, no, no.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.329
No. No, no, no.
No. No.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.623
Off. Off. Off.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.417
Oh boy.
Okay. Come on, come on.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.751
Off. Off. Okay. Okay.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.420
- Hey. Hey.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.422
No, no, no. I know, I know.
I know, I got it.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.715
You're gonna burn yourself.
You're gonna burn yourself.

23:06.261 --> 23:07.345
I had it.

23:12.058 --> 23:16.688
Sorry.
I know how well you knew Tim.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.567
I'm not sure I know anyone
well these days.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.783
Any, uh... any more updates?

23:28.783 --> 23:30.618
Apparently suicide.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.328
Hmm.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.830
So tragic.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.415
It really is.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.332
It's just...

23:37.667 --> 23:39.669
well, I mean, it doesn't explain
why Kyle ran away

23:39.669 --> 23:41.796
before the cops came.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.506
You know?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.508
Innocent people don't run.

23:56.853 --> 23:57.812
How are you doing?

23:57.812 --> 23:59.439
Still processing.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.107
I know this is tough

24:01.107 --> 24:03.443
but we need to think about
the big picture here.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.279
We need to assure our clients,
our future clients

24:06.279 --> 24:08.865
and our employees that
everything is under control.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.408
Yeah, that makes sense.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.994
But we're not expected to do
anything today, right?

24:12.994 --> 24:14.954
Well, people will be
looking for us

24:14.954 --> 24:16.664
to guide them through this.

24:16.664 --> 24:20.001
Tim wasn't just a partner,
he was a real leader,

24:20.001 --> 24:21.836
and now someone's gotta
fill that void.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.546
I need it to be you.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.839
Okay. I can do that.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.258
Good. Now...

24:27.258 --> 24:29.052
as your mother asking...

24:30.679 --> 24:32.430
how are you and Alden?

24:32.430 --> 24:34.057
I don't know, Mom.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.519
I mean, the jealousy
with Kyle was one thing.

24:37.519 --> 24:41.356
But this lying about taking
a PI class

24:41.356 --> 24:44.150
has just taken things
to a whole other level.

24:44.150 --> 24:48.738
It's... I don't even know
who my own husband is anymore.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.657
I thought you'd be relieved.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.617
Usually when a husband lies
about where he is

24:52.617 --> 24:56.037
it's because he's with another
woman or man.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.247
For better or worse,

24:57.247 --> 24:59.290
your husband lied
about night school.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.377
So what, he's just gonna become
a private investigator now?

25:02.377 --> 25:06.047
Let me ask you this,
has he seemed happier lately?

25:06.047 --> 25:07.590
I don't know.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.384
Have you asked?

25:11.970 --> 25:13.513
A couple of us were thinking
about going out

25:13.513 --> 25:16.057
for drinks tonight
in honor of Tim.

25:16.057 --> 25:18.727
Would it be okay if I sent out
a companywide email?

25:18.727 --> 25:19.561
Of course.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.479
Thanks Paula.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.066
Anything more from the police?

25:25.066 --> 25:27.235
Suicide, open and shut.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.862
Why?

25:28.862 --> 25:30.697
I mean, did Tim seem depressed
to you?

25:30.697 --> 25:31.698
Nuh uh.

25:32.782 --> 25:33.825
Was he having money problems?

25:33.825 --> 25:34.909
Oh no.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.661
Tim was very wealthy.

25:36.661 --> 25:40.707
His position here was more
for status than for a paycheck.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.500
It just doesn't make any sense.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.295
Well I've learned that people
often only show us

25:45.295 --> 25:46.796
what they want us to see.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.467
I know this is tough.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.218
Chin up.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.511
Everyone's watching.

26:06.691 --> 26:09.110
Our win seems like a million
years ago, doesn't it?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.946
Yeah.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.157
This is really hitting home, huh?

26:14.157 --> 26:16.659
Yeah. I mean, it's just...
it's such a shock.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.497
You know, I came in today

26:20.497 --> 26:23.416
thinking it was just another
work day and then...

26:24.501 --> 26:26.294
Paula, she told me
what happened

26:26.294 --> 26:28.755
and I just... I can't
believe it.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.964
Paula told you?

26:29.964 --> 26:33.176
Yeah, this morning. Why?

26:33.176 --> 26:36.513
No, you're right.
That is unbelievable.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.810
Well... hang in there.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.572
I'm gonna miss you too but
you've got a new family now.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.998
Hey.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.000
Are you sure you saw Kyle
running out

27:05.000 --> 27:06.209
of the building last night?

27:06.209 --> 27:08.294
Positive.
It's in my log book.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.879
You have a log book?

27:09.879 --> 27:12.340
Yes, I have a log book.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.720
At 7:43 PM Kyle left the Ironman
Gym on Roosevelt Ave.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.848
in a different suit
than he entered with.

27:19.848 --> 27:23.184
At 7:56 PM he arrived
at the office parking lot.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.562
He walked into the building
at 7:58

27:25.562 --> 27:27.981
and minutes later he ran
to the car and drove away.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.652
I just talked to Kyle and
something isn't making sense.

27:32.652 --> 27:35.030
He said that he found out
about Tim this morning.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.364
That's impossible.

27:36.364 --> 27:37.574
He was running away
from the building

27:37.574 --> 27:39.868
like he'd committed
a crime last night.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.578
There is something off
about Tim's death.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.872
I feel it and I know
you do too.

27:43.872 --> 27:47.125
Slow down there, Columbo.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.376
Or maybe...

27:48.376 --> 27:51.546
or maybe I need to follow him
again tonight.

27:51.546 --> 27:53.840
Except he's going to this
company drinks tonight

27:53.840 --> 27:55.258
we're having for Tim.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.385
Great!
I'll come to that.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.220
And then... and then maybe
before, you know,

27:59.220 --> 28:02.223
you and I could,
uh, get pizza.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.185
No! No pizza.
I'm still mad at you.

28:05.185 --> 28:06.394
Of course.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.856
We can do Chinese.

28:09.856 --> 28:10.857
Deal.

28:10.857 --> 28:11.775
Done.

28:16.446 --> 28:21.534
Hey. Uh... I need a small
quick favor.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.540
I've never done this
for a student before

28:27.540 --> 28:30.502
and I'm only doing so now

28:30.502 --> 28:32.045
because I believe
in your potential.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.713
Understood?

28:33.713 --> 28:34.756
Understood.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.348
It's no suicide note.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.391
None found.

28:45.684 --> 28:49.813
By the way, this wasn't free.
You owe me 7.50.

28:49.813 --> 28:52.482
I mean, like...
like a bribe?

28:52.482 --> 28:54.526
No. Copies.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.779
- Here's the receipt.
- Right.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.532
Who takes a $7 bribe?

29:11.793 --> 29:15.380
Suicide awareness for charity
in honor of Tim.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.590
That is just so thoughtful.

29:18.633 --> 29:19.801
How are you holding up?

29:19.801 --> 29:20.969
I'm hanging in there.

29:22.512 --> 29:25.348
Tim looked out for everyone.
But who was looking out for him?

29:27.767 --> 29:28.768
Thank you.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.855
I told you I should've brought
my cowboy hat.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.651
Alden.

30:20.904 --> 30:23.531
Birdie's hus... husband.

30:26.743 --> 30:30.413
Yeah. We met at the, uh,
holiday gala last year.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.336
I'm sorry about Tim.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.549
Oh, you... you two were close.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.222
Oh. You were very close.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.975
I loved him.

30:50.975 --> 30:52.352
Oh.

30:53.687 --> 30:57.857
It must be hard.
Keeping all that a secret.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.613
We were going on a cruise
next month.

31:03.613 --> 31:06.282
You know, he told his wife
about me.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.869
His wife knew that you guys
were in a relationship?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.538
Yeah, that's what Tim said.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.123
Hey, can I ask you something?

31:13.123 --> 31:14.958
What's the deal with
your license plate?

31:14.958 --> 31:15.834
KRSHNIT?

31:17.502 --> 31:18.712
Yeah. Um...

31:20.005 --> 31:23.258
Tim encouraged me to get
that actually.

31:23.258 --> 31:27.178
Uh... it just, it reminds me
every day

31:27.178 --> 31:29.889
to go after what I want,
you know?

31:32.851 --> 31:34.227
I can get on board with that.

31:36.688 --> 31:39.691
I am so glad that you two
are getting along.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.860
But I think it's time
to hit the trail.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.945
Alright.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.823
Catch you at the next rodeo?
Partner.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.199
Yeah.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.743
One day at a time, buddy.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.422
Kyle and Tim together?

32:02.422 --> 32:03.423
I know.

32:03.423 --> 32:05.925
I did not see that one coming.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.552
And Penelope knew about it?

32:07.552 --> 32:09.262
If Tim was gonna leave
his wife for Kyle,

32:09.262 --> 32:11.348
he would take all of his money
with him.

32:11.348 --> 32:13.808
I call that motive.

32:13.808 --> 32:17.437
Or... the plot of a Murder
She Wrote episode.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.855
Where's your evidence?

32:20.231 --> 32:21.566
Oh, I'll find some.

32:21.566 --> 32:22.609
Mmhmm.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.326
Okay. How about this?

32:31.326 --> 32:32.744
We go to Tim's funeral,

32:32.744 --> 32:34.120
we strike up a friendly
conversation with the widow,

32:34.120 --> 32:35.330
and then when
she's distracted...

32:35.330 --> 32:37.665
Alden, go to sleep.
I'm tired.

32:37.665 --> 32:41.544
Babe! You know I do my best
brainstorming in bed.

32:45.423 --> 32:48.051
Okay. How about this?

32:48.051 --> 32:51.930
Tomorrow we drop off some of
Tim's things from his office

32:51.930 --> 32:52.931
and size up the wife.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.391
The widow.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.934
She sounds way more guilty
when you say it like that.

32:55.934 --> 32:58.186
Fine. The widow.

32:58.186 --> 33:00.021
Marrying you was the best thing
I've ever done.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.246
I thought Tim was loaded.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.956
Well this isn't his place,
this is Paula's.

33:17.956 --> 33:21.042
Can you believe Eleonore had
Paula clean out Tim's office?

33:22.794 --> 33:23.420
Good morning.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.879
- Hi.
- Come on in.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.381
- Thanks so much.
- Yeah.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.843
I've just got Tim's stuff
over here

33:29.843 --> 33:33.138
so give me a second and
make yourselves at home.

33:33.138 --> 33:34.097
Okay.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.853
Wow. I didn't know she was
so into horses.

33:39.853 --> 33:41.646
Oh, you noticed that too?

33:41.646 --> 33:43.398
You know, it's kind of charming
when it's in a bar

33:43.398 --> 33:46.735
but when it's in your house
it's a cry for help.

33:46.735 --> 33:50.530
Says the guy who has no less
than 20 robots in his garage.

33:50.530 --> 33:51.322
Help.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.866
Here we go.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.617
Oh. Thanks so much, Paula.

33:54.617 --> 33:55.410
Thank you.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.495
Is this, um, is that you?

33:57.495 --> 34:00.665
Yeah. That... that's me
and my sister, Caroline.

34:00.665 --> 34:04.210
Now she's my angel in heaven
shining down on me.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.837
I'm so sorry.

34:05.837 --> 34:07.714
So sorry.

34:07.714 --> 34:10.759
Well... thank you so much
for keeping these safe, Paula.

34:10.759 --> 34:12.218
Anything for Tim.

34:12.218 --> 34:14.346
And if there's something else
that you need,

34:14.346 --> 34:16.264
please just ask me.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.849
We will.

34:17.849 --> 34:18.767
Take care.

34:22.228 --> 34:22.937
Thanks again, Paula.

34:22.937 --> 34:23.980
Bye.

34:33.198 --> 34:34.783
Okay.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.577
Now we're talking.

34:37.577 --> 34:39.704
Hello Governor.

34:39.704 --> 34:41.706
That's a house.

34:41.706 --> 34:45.126
On behalf of the firm, I wanted
to offer our services

34:45.126 --> 34:49.381
in case you wanted any help
at all with Tim's estate.

34:49.381 --> 34:52.133
Oh, Timmy had many things.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.052
An estate was not one of them.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.764
So all this...

34:57.764 --> 35:00.684
Oh dear, all of this
is in my name.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.977
From my father's side
of the family.

35:02.977 --> 35:05.230
Not even... life insurance?

35:05.230 --> 35:09.275
He had a meager $100,000 policy
that didn't pay out to suicides.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.527
Did you see any signs
at all

35:10.527 --> 35:11.903
that Tim might've
been depressed?

35:11.903 --> 35:13.405
Hardly.

35:13.405 --> 35:15.532
He was excited about going on
that cruise next month

35:15.532 --> 35:17.409
with that boy from the office.

35:17.409 --> 35:18.618
So you did know about that?

35:18.618 --> 35:21.538
That Tim was gay?
Yes, I knew.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.415
We didn't keep secrets
from each other.

35:23.415 --> 35:24.833
It might've been unconventional

35:24.833 --> 35:26.918
but in marriage you're
either growing together

35:26.918 --> 35:29.295
or you're growing apart.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.090
But you didn't come here
for marriage advice.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.592
So why don't you ask me
what you're really thinking?

35:35.802 --> 35:38.096
Do you really think Tim
could've killed himself?

35:38.096 --> 35:39.597
I'm convinced he didn't.

35:39.597 --> 35:42.267
And what... what makes you
so sure?

35:42.267 --> 35:45.437
Tim struggled for years
with who he was.

35:45.437 --> 35:48.606
He finally was comfortable
in his own skin.

35:48.606 --> 35:51.943
Was he having trouble
with anybody or...?

35:51.943 --> 35:53.820
There's one thing that comes
to mind.

35:53.820 --> 35:56.281
There was an incident at the
apartments he was representing

35:56.281 --> 35:58.074
for the new owners.

35:58.074 --> 36:00.285
The Cecil Bay Apartments?

36:00.285 --> 36:02.037
That sounds right.

36:02.037 --> 36:05.832
He said it was sadly something
to do with redevelopment

36:05.832 --> 36:09.502
or some such and that when they
handed out the eviction notices

36:09.502 --> 36:12.297
he was threatened by one
of the tenants there.

36:12.297 --> 36:13.715
He didn't go into much detail

36:13.715 --> 36:17.802
but something gave him
quite a fright.

36:17.802 --> 36:18.887
Hmm.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.013
I take it by this line
of questioning

36:20.013 --> 36:21.222
you're investigating this.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.098
- Yes.
- No.

36:23.683 --> 36:25.685
Well, not in any
official capacity.

36:25.685 --> 36:28.772
Well, not... not in any
official capacity.

36:28.772 --> 36:32.317
If you have any other comments
or anything else occurs to you,

36:32.317 --> 36:33.693
please feel free to contact us.

36:33.693 --> 36:35.653
And again, if the firm...

36:35.653 --> 36:37.489
if the firm can help you
in any way,

36:37.489 --> 36:39.657
please don't hesitate to ask us.
- Sure.

36:39.657 --> 36:43.203
I think your husband
is doing quite enough.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.579
Yes, he has.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.706
Marcia will see you out.

36:53.004 --> 36:55.048
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

36:56.091 --> 36:57.092
One more thing...

36:57.092 --> 36:58.301
Alden, we have to go.

36:59.636 --> 37:00.929
Let's be honest.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.430
You see everything
that goes on around here.

37:02.430 --> 37:05.850
You notice anything strange
about Tim's behavior lately?

37:05.850 --> 37:07.852
Bill Coulter from
the yacht club.

37:07.852 --> 37:10.355
I know they were involved
in some sort of lawsuit

37:10.355 --> 37:11.940
with each other

37:11.940 --> 37:16.528
but last week Bill and Tim had
an argument in the driveway.

37:16.528 --> 37:19.197
What happened?
Did he get violent? Physical?

37:19.197 --> 37:22.534
Bill didn't get out of the car.
But there was a lot of yelling.

37:22.534 --> 37:23.868
What was the lawsuit about?

37:23.868 --> 37:28.415
I don't know.
But they were both very angry.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.000
That's my business card.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.044
Feel free to contact me,
day or night, preferably day.

37:34.879 --> 37:35.839
Good day.

37:37.257 --> 37:39.300
Business cards, really?

37:39.300 --> 37:40.760
I printed up a few.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.345
I'm trying out a couple
different fonts.

37:42.345 --> 37:44.764
Ugh. I gotta get back to work,
I'll drop you off at home. Okay?

37:44.764 --> 37:46.266
I thought we were going
to the yacht club.

37:46.266 --> 37:48.643
Well as much as I do love their
Cobb salad, I just can't.

37:48.643 --> 37:49.894
I don't have time.

37:49.894 --> 37:51.438
Since when have you been
to the yacht club?

37:51.438 --> 37:52.772
Lots of times.
They're our clients.

37:52.772 --> 37:54.149
Well let's go then.

37:54.149 --> 37:55.942
I can't. Eleonore's breathing
down my neck.

37:57.861 --> 38:00.280
Actually... that's perfect.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.032
Then you can get the files
on that case that Penelope

38:02.032 --> 38:03.700
was talking about.
The Cecil...

38:03.700 --> 38:04.784
- The Cecil Bay Apartments.
- The Cecil Bay Apartments, yeah.

38:04.784 --> 38:06.077
The Cecil Bay Apartments
have new owners

38:06.077 --> 38:08.580
and they wanna turn them
into high-end condos.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.956
Tim was dealing with
the current tenants,

38:09.956 --> 38:11.875
trying to get them out nicely.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.918
Well, that sounds like a recipe
for bad blood.

38:13.918 --> 38:16.629
We definitely need
to get those files.

38:16.629 --> 38:18.923
No. No, no, no.
No one's going over any files.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.717
That's privileged information.

38:20.717 --> 38:23.970
Ah. Got it.
Playing by the book.

38:25.013 --> 38:26.473
No, I'm not playing anything
any way.

38:26.473 --> 38:27.807
No, I gotcha.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.477
Alden, there's no...
nothing to follow. Okay?

38:31.936 --> 38:34.314
No. You know what, I have
to get to work, okay?

38:34.314 --> 38:36.775
And I would love to do this all
day but I actually have a job

38:36.775 --> 38:38.777
that I have to get
to the office for.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.779
It's fine. I can go by myself.

38:52.207 --> 38:55.835
Mister... Coulter.

38:55.835 --> 38:58.713
You can take the salad
but leave the drink.

38:58.713 --> 39:01.424
Actually... I was hoping
you and I

39:01.424 --> 39:03.968
could have a friendly
little chat.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.638
Depends. Are you working
for my ex-wife?

39:06.638 --> 39:07.972
No.

39:07.972 --> 39:08.973
Then sure.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.187
Interesting book.

39:14.187 --> 39:17.607
<i>Knots For Sailors.</i>
It's driving me crazy.

39:17.607 --> 39:22.737
I wanna talk to you about...
Tim Grant.

39:22.737 --> 39:25.156
I thought you said this
was gonna be a friendly chat.

39:25.156 --> 39:28.034
Oh. So I see you've heard
the news?

39:28.034 --> 39:29.536
I heard he checked out early.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.787
That's one theory.

39:30.787 --> 39:32.247
But you have another.

39:33.373 --> 39:38.003
Rumor has it you and he had
a pretty heated argument.

39:38.003 --> 39:40.213
Oh yeah, I wanted
to murder him.

39:42.382 --> 39:43.258
Did you?

39:44.509 --> 39:46.219
Son, if I killed every person
that sued me,

39:46.219 --> 39:47.929
I'd be a serial killer.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.849
What was the lawsuit about?

39:50.849 --> 39:53.435
Yacht stuff.
Rich old guy drama.

39:53.435 --> 39:55.979
I'm honored that you think
I'm capable of murdering Tim

39:55.979 --> 39:59.357
but I just don't see
that happening.

39:59.357 --> 40:02.402
Oh yeah? Why is that?

40:09.409 --> 40:12.412
Hip replacement a month ago,
lost a fight with a sidewalk.

40:12.412 --> 40:14.706
I don't think I'd stand much
of a chance with Tim.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.750
Oh!

40:16.750 --> 40:19.002
That's why you waited
in the car.

40:19.002 --> 40:21.421
You're a very bright young man.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.467
Thanks for lunch.

40:28.303 --> 40:29.304
What?

40:37.604 --> 40:40.148
Five missed calls this morning, Birdie.

40:41.483 --> 40:42.942
I'm sorry.

40:42.942 --> 40:44.903
That's five times I needed you
and you weren't there.

40:44.903 --> 40:47.530
Alden and I took a few of
Tim's things out to his wife.

40:47.530 --> 40:52.327
Oh. That's very sweet of you
but that is not your job.

40:52.327 --> 40:55.413
You're right. You're right.
But I'm here now. Okay?

40:55.413 --> 40:56.456
My head's in the game.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.624
There are a dozen people

40:57.624 --> 40:59.292
clawing their way
to the top here

40:59.292 --> 41:01.544
and right now you aren't
one of them.

41:01.544 --> 41:02.837
The door's open, Birdie,

41:02.837 --> 41:04.923
but I can only hold it open
for you so long.

41:04.923 --> 41:07.092
I'm doing the best that I can.

41:07.092 --> 41:10.345
Well, it pains me to say this,
but it needs to be better.

41:23.274 --> 41:26.611
Hey girl. Figured you could use
a midday pick me up.

41:26.611 --> 41:28.238
Oh, wow.

41:28.238 --> 41:29.906
I can't remember the last time
someone brought me a coffee.

41:29.906 --> 41:31.449
Oh, it's nothing.

41:31.449 --> 41:34.285
Uh... hey. While I have you,
a quick favor to ask you.

41:34.285 --> 41:36.996
Have you seen the files on
the Cecil Bay Apartments?

41:36.996 --> 41:38.873
Oh, are you taking over
that case from Tim?

41:38.873 --> 41:40.458
I'm just trying to fill in
some of the gaps

41:40.458 --> 41:41.459
that Tim left behind.

41:41.459 --> 41:42.544
That's great.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.880
Uh... Yeah.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.007
Here you go.

41:47.007 --> 41:48.008
That should be everything
you need.

41:48.008 --> 41:49.884
Great. Thank you so much.

41:50.719 --> 41:52.721
Oh... and hey,
one more thing.

41:52.721 --> 41:54.305
When Tim gave notice
to the tenants,

41:54.305 --> 41:57.350
did he mention seeing anything
strange or...?

41:57.350 --> 41:58.893
Strange?

41:58.893 --> 42:02.856
Oh, you mean like that old lady
with the gun in her nightgown?

42:02.856 --> 42:04.607
I would classify that
as strange.

42:04.607 --> 42:06.693
I'm sure it was.

42:06.693 --> 42:09.571
No. But she did really
spook him.

42:09.571 --> 42:10.905
Huh.

42:11.656 --> 42:12.907
Thanks.

42:18.204 --> 42:22.042
Natbot 8,000.
Can you solve Tim's murder?

42:23.710 --> 42:26.546
Don't look at me like that.
That's what you're here for.

42:28.298 --> 42:30.425
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.010
How's the office?

42:32.010 --> 42:34.721
Definitely not as fun as
what we were doing before.

42:34.721 --> 42:36.097
Any luck at the yacht club?

42:36.097 --> 42:38.350
Nope. Swing and a miss.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.768
Hmm.

42:39.768 --> 42:42.312
Well, I thought these
might help.

42:46.191 --> 42:47.525
The Cecil Bay Apartment files?

42:47.525 --> 42:48.735
Mmhmm.

42:48.735 --> 42:50.070
What changed your mind?

42:50.070 --> 42:51.237
You know, I just thought

42:51.237 --> 42:53.948
playing it by the book... overrated.

43:01.623 --> 43:04.668
Okay. Let's get all the tenants
up on the board,

43:04.668 --> 43:07.420
shake the tree,
see what comes out.

43:28.024 --> 43:30.443
There are 15 tenants in
the Cecil Bay building.

43:30.443 --> 43:33.488
So Tim, acting on behalf
of the new owners,

43:33.488 --> 43:35.490
was in the process of evicting
the tenants

43:35.490 --> 43:37.242
so they could turn the building
into luxury condos.

43:37.242 --> 43:38.576
Right. On that fact alone,

43:38.576 --> 43:40.453
everybody had a motive
to want Tim gone.

43:40.453 --> 43:42.539
And our working theory
is that same person

43:42.539 --> 43:45.208
went to Tim's office three days
later, killed him,

43:45.208 --> 43:46.459
making it look like a suicide.

43:46.459 --> 43:48.128
Exactly.

43:48.128 --> 43:50.130
We've been able to definitively
rule out 12 out of 15 tenants

43:50.130 --> 43:51.381
for various reasons.

43:51.381 --> 43:53.299
Either lack of means
or opportunity or both.

43:53.299 --> 43:55.719
Which leaves us three
potential suspects.

43:55.719 --> 43:57.095
Right.

43:57.095 --> 43:59.806
Number one.
Francis Taylor.

44:00.974 --> 44:02.350
Apartment 201.

44:02.350 --> 44:04.436
Now this guy was convicted
of manslaughter in 1982,

44:04.436 --> 44:05.979
he served 12 years,

44:05.979 --> 44:07.439
he's been living in
the building ever since.

44:07.439 --> 44:08.815
He's been employed
as a counsellor

44:08.815 --> 44:10.275
for newly released inmates,

44:10.275 --> 44:11.901
helping them get adjusted
to their new lives.

44:11.901 --> 44:14.738
It's possible he did it.
I don't see it.

44:14.738 --> 44:15.822
I don't either.

44:17.365 --> 44:20.618
And then we have the old lady
with a gun in her nightgown.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.289
Eugenia Carmopolis,
apartment 112.

44:24.289 --> 44:26.750
She does have a concealed carry
permit so she has the means.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.544
Only problem is
she's legally blind.

44:29.544 --> 44:30.712
Which leaves us...

44:31.755 --> 44:32.839
Frederick Gasko.

44:34.090 --> 44:35.467
Apartment 101.

44:35.467 --> 44:37.761
Now Mr. Gasko is the only tenant
in the building

44:37.761 --> 44:41.848
who pays his rent in cash
and the only picture on file

44:41.848 --> 44:43.933
is from a driver's license
from 1989.

44:43.933 --> 44:45.769
Which I think we both agree
is totally fake.

44:45.769 --> 44:47.145
For sure.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.271
I can't believe they spelled
Massachusetts wrong.

44:48.271 --> 44:49.606
I mean, how do you get away
with that?

44:49.606 --> 44:51.024
No, I think that's actually
the real crime here.

44:51.024 --> 44:52.734
But the question is...

44:52.734 --> 44:55.362
why does Mr. Gasko
need a fake ID?

44:55.362 --> 45:02.077
Perhaps it's because Frederick
Gasko and Lean McGuiness

45:02.077 --> 45:04.037
are the same person.

45:04.037 --> 45:05.705
It does look like him.

45:05.705 --> 45:08.041
Because it is him.

45:08.041 --> 45:11.127
One of America's most dangerous
mobsters, on the run, 30 years,

45:11.127 --> 45:12.462
hiding in plain sight.

45:12.462 --> 45:14.839
Lean McGuiness killed Tim
because he was about

45:14.839 --> 45:17.759
to blow his cover and kick him
out of his hiding spot.

45:17.759 --> 45:20.053
Mic drop.
That's the game.

45:20.053 --> 45:21.554
Happy birthday!

45:21.554 --> 45:22.889
Hold up.

45:22.889 --> 45:23.932
I'm bumping on one thing.

45:23.932 --> 45:25.016
What?

45:26.434 --> 45:29.229
Lean McGuiness' body was
discovered before Tim died.

45:29.229 --> 45:31.815
How does a dead man
kill Tim?

45:34.484 --> 45:36.403
Okay, that's actually
a really good point.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.321
I'm not sure but there has to be
a connection.

45:38.321 --> 45:39.322
Come on!

45:39.322 --> 45:41.074
There's no way
it's a coincidence

45:41.074 --> 45:42.909
that Tim very likely
discovered Lean

45:42.909 --> 45:46.162
and then both Tim and Lean were
found dead within the same week.

45:46.162 --> 45:47.414
It does seem unlikely.

45:47.414 --> 45:48.581
Come on.

45:48.581 --> 45:51.251
Just acknowledge
we're onto something here.

45:51.251 --> 45:55.714
Alden Case, you are becoming
quite the investigator.

46:06.975 --> 46:09.853
You're up early.
Did you get any sleep?

46:09.853 --> 46:12.981
Actually, I woke up in
the middle of the night

46:12.981 --> 46:14.733
with an idea.

46:14.733 --> 46:18.653
I know... what we need to do.

46:18.653 --> 46:20.405
- Veggie omelets?
- Mmhmm.

46:20.405 --> 46:21.531
- Kiwis.
- Yes.

46:21.531 --> 46:24.617
- Strawberries and pancakes?
- Correct.

46:26.077 --> 46:27.912
What are you
buttering me up for?

46:27.912 --> 46:29.831
Hear me out.

46:29.831 --> 46:32.334
I think we need to visit
the Cecil Bay Apartments

46:32.334 --> 46:34.252
and see if Frederick Gasko
is there.

46:34.252 --> 46:36.880
Whoa! That's a big step,
don't you think?

46:36.880 --> 46:38.423
You saw the pictures.

46:38.423 --> 46:40.967
Frederick Gasko
is Lean McGuiness.
It's the same person.

46:40.967 --> 46:42.594
Yes, they do look alike. Okay.

46:42.594 --> 46:46.639
But I think the safest thing
to do would be to call the FBI

46:46.639 --> 46:47.682
and tell them what we think.

46:47.682 --> 46:49.267
Argh!

46:49.267 --> 46:50.435
They are still investigating
what happened to Lean McGuiness.

46:50.435 --> 46:51.686
We don't wanna get
in the middle of that.

46:51.686 --> 46:52.687
Okay.

46:54.981 --> 46:57.984
Before we do that,
how about this?

46:57.984 --> 47:00.278
We go to the apartments,
we knock on the door,

47:00.278 --> 47:03.156
if Frederick Gasko answers,
that's it I quit, game over.

47:03.156 --> 47:04.491
And if he doesn't answer?

47:04.491 --> 47:06.493
If Gasko's not there,
we call the FBI,

47:06.493 --> 47:07.619
we tell them what we know.

47:07.619 --> 47:09.120
And you will stand down?

47:09.120 --> 47:11.915
I will hand the information
over to the fancy people

47:11.915 --> 47:15.835
with their badges. Promise.

47:15.835 --> 47:16.961
Let me think about it.

47:16.961 --> 47:18.254
I have this meeting
at 10:00 AM

47:18.254 --> 47:19.756
that I am not looking
forward to.

47:19.756 --> 47:22.509
Oh yeah, I bet.
I bet you do.

47:22.509 --> 47:25.720
Meetings are tough.
You just think about it. Okay?

47:25.720 --> 47:26.888
Mmhmm.

47:26.888 --> 47:27.806
Just think about it.

47:27.806 --> 47:29.974
That's... that's excellent.

47:29.974 --> 47:31.726
You got a lot of knots
back here, what's going on?

47:31.726 --> 47:33.103
I know. Oh God.

47:34.312 --> 47:36.564
Yes, I know.
100 percent, Mr. Keller.

47:36.564 --> 47:38.400
I mean, we're very excited,
you know.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.068
We can't wait
for the next steps.

47:40.068 --> 47:42.320
Thanks Ben, chat soon.

47:43.196 --> 47:44.531
Wait, was that the Keller call?

47:45.573 --> 47:47.033
I thought it was at 10:00.

47:47.033 --> 47:48.660
It got moved to 9:00.
I thought you knew that.

47:48.660 --> 47:50.328
Kyle, great work.

47:50.328 --> 47:52.163
Start putting together
your proposal.

47:53.581 --> 47:54.624
I'm on it.

47:56.751 --> 47:58.878
Doesn't feel good,
does it?

47:58.878 --> 48:01.006
You did this on purpose.

48:01.006 --> 48:03.842
Kyle isn't half the lawyer
you are.

48:03.842 --> 48:05.385
But he's hungry.

48:13.893 --> 48:17.647
Hey. Let's do this.
Pick me up at 6:00

48:22.777 --> 48:23.737
This is it.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.287
I can't decide if I want Gasko
to be home or not.

48:32.287 --> 48:35.290
Okay. So we are just knocking
on the door, Alden.

48:35.290 --> 48:36.207
And if he doesn't answer...

48:36.207 --> 48:38.168
I will stand down.

48:38.168 --> 48:39.711
Okay, let's do this.

48:39.711 --> 48:40.587
One sec.

48:42.422 --> 48:43.381
Fake mustache.

48:43.381 --> 48:45.008
Why would you need
a fake mustache?

48:45.008 --> 48:46.134
So no one knows who we are.

48:46.134 --> 48:47.969
No one knows
who we are anyway!

48:47.969 --> 48:49.304
Exactly.

48:50.972 --> 48:52.098
Alden.

48:53.767 --> 48:54.684
Hmm?

48:56.394 --> 48:58.188
Wait, wait, wait.
What's with the hat?

48:58.188 --> 48:59.606
Come on, rookie.

49:00.732 --> 49:02.108
Oy vey.

49:03.902 --> 49:05.236
I can't believe
we're doing this.

49:05.236 --> 49:06.905
In and out, okay?
We're just knocking on the door.

49:06.905 --> 49:08.114
Just follow my lead.

49:08.114 --> 49:09.616
This is what I've been
training for.

49:11.201 --> 49:13.912
Okay. 102, Ms. Berman.
She's a kindergarten teacher.

49:15.914 --> 49:16.915
Hello?

49:16.915 --> 49:19.209
Yeah. This is, uh,
Mario's pizza.

49:19.209 --> 49:21.252
What accent is that?

49:21.252 --> 49:23.713
We got a couple of pies here,
they're for 103,

49:23.713 --> 49:25.423
that we can't deliver.

49:25.423 --> 49:26.633
Well that's not
my problem.

49:28.468 --> 49:29.594
Okay. New plan.

49:29.594 --> 49:30.512
Yeah.

49:30.512 --> 49:32.222
We wait until someone
comes out.

49:32.222 --> 49:35.725
Or we just use the keys.

49:35.725 --> 49:36.810
Where did you get those?

49:36.810 --> 49:38.269
They were in the file.

49:39.896 --> 49:41.189
Come on.

49:41.898 --> 49:43.149
Rookie.

49:44.943 --> 49:46.152
Oh.

49:47.153 --> 49:48.613
Charming little spot.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.368
Was it you?

49:54.953 --> 49:55.912
I'm sorry?

49:55.912 --> 49:56.955
Huh?

49:56.955 --> 49:58.873
Was it you who took
my wheelchair?

49:58.873 --> 50:02.585
‘Cause I left it right here and
the next thing I know it's gone.

50:02.585 --> 50:05.338
We... no, no, no.
We haven't seen it.

50:05.338 --> 50:07.465
Are you alright?
Do you need us to take you...

50:09.509 --> 50:11.219
I'll be fine.

50:14.889 --> 50:16.266
Well that checks out.

50:16.266 --> 50:17.559
I think she likes you.

50:18.101 --> 50:19.102
It's the mustache.

50:19.102 --> 50:21.396
Oh... are you jealous?

50:21.396 --> 50:21.938
Maybe.

50:23.356 --> 50:24.482
Yikes.

50:24.482 --> 50:25.442
Okay.

50:26.526 --> 50:28.319
This is it. 101.
This is it, this is it.

50:28.319 --> 50:30.030
Uh... I'm having
second thoughts.

50:30.030 --> 50:31.156
I'm just gonna knock.

50:31.156 --> 50:32.699
It literally says don't knock.

50:32.699 --> 50:34.909
It also says leave packages.
I don't plan to do that either.

50:34.909 --> 50:36.161
Uh...

50:43.168 --> 50:44.461
Mr. Gasko?

50:46.588 --> 50:47.839
Mr. Gasko?

50:52.510 --> 50:53.803
Mr. Gasko?

50:53.803 --> 50:54.929
Alden!

50:54.929 --> 50:58.350
- Mr. Gasko?
- Alden, let's go.

50:58.350 --> 51:00.769
Birdie, you need
to get in here.

51:00.769 --> 51:01.853
Uh.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.908
This guy needs a housekeeper.

51:17.619 --> 51:18.828
We should really get
outta here.

51:18.828 --> 51:20.246
Yeah, we should.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.293
Oh, my gosh.

51:25.293 --> 51:26.419
What is it?

51:26.419 --> 51:28.380
Look at all this mustard!

51:28.380 --> 51:30.048
This guy must be a real
sandwich nut.

51:30.048 --> 51:31.383
Alden, let's go!
Come on.

51:31.383 --> 51:32.759
Will you relax?
It's not like we're...

51:33.927 --> 51:34.969
What?

51:34.969 --> 51:36.763
Birdie. Check this out.

51:38.473 --> 51:39.391
Alden!

51:40.767 --> 51:41.768
Right.

51:43.269 --> 51:45.271
Yeah. Now might be a good time
to call the FBI.

51:45.855 --> 51:47.107
Let's call them from the car.

51:47.107 --> 51:48.233
I knew we shouldn't
have come here.

51:48.233 --> 51:49.109
This was a mistake.

51:49.109 --> 51:51.319
Ella, call FBI.

51:51.319 --> 51:53.571
FBI! Put your hands up.

51:53.571 --> 51:56.533
Calling
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

52:00.203 --> 52:01.746
FBI.
What's the emergency?

52:11.381 --> 52:12.674
I could get disbarred for this, Alden.

52:12.674 --> 52:14.175
I told you we should've gotten
out of there.

52:14.175 --> 52:16.302
Birdie, we are this close

52:16.302 --> 52:18.430
to blowing this whole thing
wide open.

52:18.430 --> 52:20.473
What planet are you living on?

52:20.473 --> 52:23.852
In the real world, if the FBI
has you handcuffed

52:23.852 --> 52:25.311
in the back of a car,

52:25.311 --> 52:26.980
that means you have to make
some serious life changes.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.773
Okay. Here's what
I think we do.

52:28.773 --> 52:30.191
No. You know what?

52:30.191 --> 52:31.860
I can't partake in your
detective fantasy anymore.

52:31.860 --> 52:33.653
Okay? I'm done.

52:33.653 --> 52:34.654
I'm done.

52:39.117 --> 52:40.535
...Yeah, I'm on it.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.540
Unbelievable.
Here he comes.

52:47.250 --> 52:48.835
Alright. Come on now.

52:52.088 --> 52:53.757
You're lucky my mom
is who she is.

52:53.757 --> 52:54.924
Yeah.

52:55.842 --> 52:57.177
Thank you.

52:59.888 --> 53:00.930
Your story checks out.

53:00.930 --> 53:02.015
Of course it does.

53:02.015 --> 53:04.893
But listen up.
Amateur hour is over.

53:04.893 --> 53:06.686
You understand?

53:06.686 --> 53:07.687
You're free to go.

53:07.687 --> 53:09.481
I am not an amateur.

53:09.481 --> 53:10.732
I've almost got
my certificate...

53:10.732 --> 53:13.026
Uh... thank you so much
Special Agent Digbee.

53:13.026 --> 53:14.319
So sorry for the trouble.

53:14.319 --> 53:16.654
Okay. Well what about
the Tim Lean connection?

53:17.447 --> 53:18.698
'Cause I'm starting to think

53:18.698 --> 53:20.033
that there is a real mob element
at play here.

53:20.033 --> 53:21.368
In fact my new theory...

53:21.368 --> 53:25.663
Mr. Case, some free advice.
Stay in your lane.

53:25.663 --> 53:28.375
Perhaps Reddit would be a more
appropriate arena for you.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.876
Plus...

53:29.876 --> 53:32.128
I got an unmarked blue sedan
that's been trailing me around,

53:32.128 --> 53:34.589
which means we are definitely
close to something.

53:34.589 --> 53:37.842
- Wait. You're being trailed?
- Yes.

53:37.842 --> 53:39.094
- By a blue sedan?
- Yes.

53:39.094 --> 53:40.679
- You're sure?
- Yes!

53:40.679 --> 53:42.681
- Well this changes everything.
- It does?

53:42.681 --> 53:43.723
Absolutely...

53:45.058 --> 53:46.351
Not.

53:46.351 --> 53:47.310
Oh.

53:48.728 --> 53:49.688
Counselor.

53:52.190 --> 53:53.233
Alright, I'm going
to talk to them.

53:53.233 --> 53:55.193
No, no, Alden.
You promised.

53:55.193 --> 53:56.611
You promised that you would let

53:56.611 --> 53:58.571
the people with the badges
solve this.

53:58.571 --> 53:59.948
I am not quitting.

54:00.615 --> 54:03.159
Oh, there it is.
That look of disappointment.

54:03.159 --> 54:06.037
Please. Please. It is time
to walk away.

54:06.037 --> 54:09.290
From what, Birdie?
From the case or...

54:09.290 --> 54:11.251
or from our marriage?

54:11.251 --> 54:13.795
Maybe... maybe we should
just quit and get divorced.

54:13.795 --> 54:14.754
Huh Birdie?

54:16.256 --> 54:17.590
You saw the papers.

54:17.590 --> 54:19.300
I drew those up after
the cryptocurrency thing.

54:19.300 --> 54:20.885
I was angry. Okay?

54:20.885 --> 54:23.054
You weren't supposed to see.
How did you get those anyway?

54:23.054 --> 54:25.098
They looked pretty official
to me.

54:25.098 --> 54:27.267
I might've lied
about accounting

54:27.267 --> 54:29.894
but you kept a divorce
secret from me.

54:29.894 --> 54:32.772
I don't know whether to be
hurt or impressed.

54:32.772 --> 54:34.482
Well, if you saw them
why didn't you say anything?

54:34.482 --> 54:39.320
Because maybe... maybe
saying it out loud made it true.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.614
So... so what is it?

54:41.614 --> 54:44.367
Are we... are we...
are we done?

54:46.036 --> 54:47.996
It's like Penelope said,
we're either growing together

54:47.996 --> 54:49.330
or we're growing apart.

54:49.330 --> 54:54.085
And for a while now...
we've been growing apart.

54:54.085 --> 54:55.420
When we got married,

54:55.420 --> 54:58.256
is this what you pictured
our life being like?

54:58.256 --> 55:02.302
No. Not exactly.

55:02.302 --> 55:04.804
I thought we'd, you know,
have a boat and...

55:04.804 --> 55:06.181
and a kid or two.

55:06.181 --> 55:09.684
But as long as I'm with you,
none of that matters.

55:09.684 --> 55:11.770
What did you think it was
gonna be like?

55:11.770 --> 55:13.229
Not this.

55:13.229 --> 55:14.689
I'm not quitting on us.

55:16.775 --> 55:17.776
What are you doing?

55:17.776 --> 55:19.986
I'm walking home.
Here's the keys.

55:21.404 --> 55:22.781
It's the other way, Alden.

55:22.781 --> 55:23.990
Thank you.

55:28.244 --> 55:29.954
Good evening.
I'm Trisha Murata reporting live

55:29.954 --> 55:33.750
from the Cecil Bay Apartments
on Third Street.

55:33.750 --> 55:36.503
More pieces of the puzzle
are emerging as investigators

55:36.503 --> 55:41.383
confirm the location
where notorious mob boss...

55:59.526 --> 56:01.194
Bird! Bird. Hey, hey.

56:02.445 --> 56:04.322
So what happened last night?
Is it true?

56:04.322 --> 56:06.157
Did you get busted by the FBI?

56:06.157 --> 56:07.325
No.

56:07.325 --> 56:09.494
Well... not exactly.

56:09.494 --> 56:10.370
How did you hear?

56:10.370 --> 56:11.621
- Paula.
- Paula.

56:11.621 --> 56:13.039
Yeah. Yeah

56:13.039 --> 56:14.666
The Cecil Bay developers
called first thing this morning.

56:14.666 --> 56:15.333
How bad is it?

56:15.333 --> 56:16.418
Oh. No, no, no.

56:16.418 --> 56:17.752
They're ecstatic.

56:17.752 --> 56:18.878
They are?

56:18.878 --> 56:20.213
It's now the hottest property
in town.

56:20.213 --> 56:22.048
Nothing gets rich yuppies
putting down deposits

56:22.048 --> 56:24.968
more than a condo building
that was once a mob hideout.

56:24.968 --> 56:26.261
That's great.

56:26.261 --> 56:28.847
Well, great. I'm glad to hear
you say that.

56:28.847 --> 56:30.765
So no hard feelings?

56:30.765 --> 56:31.766
What do you mean?

56:31.766 --> 56:33.893
Well, I assume Eleonore
told you.

56:33.893 --> 56:35.770
I'm the lead on Cecil Bay.

56:37.355 --> 56:39.482
Oh! Yeah, no...
she told me.

56:39.482 --> 56:42.360
I am so happy for you.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.862
- Dream team, yeah?
- Mmhmm.

56:43.862 --> 56:44.529
Yeah.

57:04.257 --> 57:06.384
Okay.

57:06.384 --> 57:09.888
Kyle was having
an affair with Tim.

57:09.888 --> 57:12.974
Which Tim's wife was oddly
cool about it.

57:12.974 --> 57:17.645
Simultaneously, Tim was trying
to evict Lean McGuiness

57:17.645 --> 57:19.856
from his hiding spot
of 30 years.

57:19.856 --> 57:22.359
Which might've caused Lean
to call his old mob connections

57:22.359 --> 57:24.694
to get rid of Tim.

57:24.694 --> 57:27.989
We also know Lean had
a neighbor,

57:27.989 --> 57:33.578
one Mrs. Eugenia T. Carmopolis,
who was in possession of a gun.

57:33.578 --> 57:36.456
Now... could this have been
a neighbor dispute?

57:36.456 --> 57:39.250
Did Lean like to watch
his TV too loud?

57:39.250 --> 57:42.629
We just don't know.

57:42.629 --> 57:47.801
So apparently the Cecil Bay
Apartments completely sold out.

57:47.801 --> 57:52.013
Everyone wants to live where
Lean McGuiness was hiding out.

57:52.013 --> 57:52.972
Hmm.

57:55.684 --> 57:57.394
Babe.

57:57.394 --> 57:58.978
That's a big deal.

57:58.978 --> 58:02.315
We connected the dots to
Lean McGuiness' hiding spot.

58:02.315 --> 58:04.526
A week after the FBI did.

58:04.526 --> 58:07.278
Well, they got resources.

58:13.493 --> 58:15.078
No, no, no.
Let me go first.

58:15.078 --> 58:16.204
Let me go first.

58:18.164 --> 58:19.165
What was it?

58:21.126 --> 58:22.252
What?

58:32.345 --> 58:33.888
Wait, Alden.
Be careful, be careful.

58:33.888 --> 58:35.015
It's just a brick.

58:35.849 --> 58:36.766
Perfect.

58:37.350 --> 58:38.476
A baseball glove?

58:38.476 --> 58:39.728
I don't know.

58:41.855 --> 58:44.858
Will you just... be careful.
Okay? Don't cut yourself.

58:46.526 --> 58:47.861
What's it say?

58:51.406 --> 58:53.908
Let sleeping dogs lie.

59:02.876 --> 59:03.793
Okay.

59:04.919 --> 59:08.757
So... because you are
"hot on the trail"

59:08.757 --> 59:11.634
with something involving
"Lean McGuiness",

59:11.634 --> 59:13.261
you think that the brick
that went through your window

59:13.261 --> 59:16.556
was somehow "mob related".

59:16.556 --> 59:19.017
That's correct,
officer air quotes.

59:19.017 --> 59:20.810
It's officer Newton.
It's not officer air quotes.

59:20.810 --> 59:23.396
Sorry, officer "Newton".

59:23.396 --> 59:24.314
You know what?

59:24.314 --> 59:26.649
Officer... are we in danger?

59:26.649 --> 59:27.859
You know what?

59:27.859 --> 59:29.402
It's probably just some kids
playing a prank.

59:29.402 --> 59:30.820
I'll write a report, let you
know if anything comes up.

59:30.820 --> 59:31.738
Thank you.

59:33.490 --> 59:34.866
Should I be concerned
about that?

59:36.743 --> 59:40.413
Oh, that's just
an "art project".

59:40.413 --> 59:42.290
Don't do things that I do.

59:42.290 --> 59:43.708
Have a nice night.

59:43.708 --> 59:44.751
Not you.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.714
Well, why throw a brick
through the window?

59:49.714 --> 59:52.092
Why not just leave
a note in the mailbox

59:52.092 --> 59:53.510
or tape it to the front door.

59:53.510 --> 59:55.136
It's to send a message, Alden.

59:55.136 --> 59:56.930
Leaving a letter
in the mailbox,

59:56.930 --> 59:58.223
not exactly threatening.

59:58.223 --> 1:00:00.350
Mmhmm. Well it'd be
the decent thing to do.

1:00:00.350 --> 1:00:01.976
You know what I think
the decent thing to do is?

1:00:01.976 --> 1:00:04.521
I think the decent thing to do
is just to take a step back

1:00:04.521 --> 1:00:07.357
and let things cool down a bit.

1:00:07.357 --> 1:00:09.359
I can't do that.

1:00:09.359 --> 1:00:11.486
Alden... whoever threw
that brick

1:00:11.486 --> 1:00:13.363
knows where we live.

1:00:13.363 --> 1:00:15.115
What if next time
they don't stay outside?

1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:21.913
Waiter.

1:00:21.913 --> 1:00:23.206
Watchmaker's apprentice.

1:00:23.206 --> 1:00:24.207
Cheesemonger.

1:00:24.207 --> 1:00:25.458
Notary.

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:27.877
T-shirt screen printer.

1:00:27.877 --> 1:00:28.878
Museum docent.

1:00:28.878 --> 1:00:29.879
Barista.

1:00:29.879 --> 1:00:31.256
Crypto currency miner.

1:00:31.256 --> 1:00:32.841
What are you getting at?

1:00:32.841 --> 1:00:35.593
These are all the careers
that I have started and quit.

1:00:35.593 --> 1:00:37.679
And some of them were too easy,
some of them were too hard,

1:00:37.679 --> 1:00:39.556
some of them were
just terrible ideas.

1:00:39.556 --> 1:00:41.850
Yeah, but all those things
make you you.

1:00:41.850 --> 1:00:45.478
I don't wanna be known as the
guy who quits things anymore.

1:00:45.478 --> 1:00:49.816
This case, I have to solve it.

1:00:49.816 --> 1:00:52.318
And that brick...

1:00:52.318 --> 1:00:54.779
that means we're making somebody
very nervous.

1:00:54.779 --> 1:00:58.158
Yeah. And I'm a little scared.

1:00:58.158 --> 1:00:59.451
Me too.

1:01:01.036 --> 1:01:02.078
And I don't know exactly

1:01:02.078 --> 1:01:06.166
how this whole thing's
gonna play out.

1:01:06.166 --> 1:01:08.168
Kinda like me and you.

1:01:11.087 --> 1:01:12.172
But I'm not quitting.

1:01:13.673 --> 1:01:16.718
Because I know in my heart
they're both worth fighting for.

1:01:43.078 --> 1:01:44.537
Wow.

1:01:47.499 --> 1:01:49.876
It was Kyle all along.

1:01:51.002 --> 1:01:53.922
Ado Construction is the company
that was developing the site

1:01:53.922 --> 1:01:55.757
where Lean McGuiness
was found.

1:01:55.757 --> 1:01:58.927
It's on Kyle's shirt
in this picture

1:01:58.927 --> 1:02:02.597
because the owner of the company
is Kyle's uncle!

1:02:02.597 --> 1:02:04.140
How much coffee
have you had?

1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:06.935
Birdie, this is the connection
that we've been looking for.

1:02:06.935 --> 1:02:10.897
I think Kyle killed
Lean McGuiness and then Tim.

1:02:10.897 --> 1:02:12.607
What? No. I...

1:02:12.607 --> 1:02:15.235
I really don't see Kyle
being capable of one murder,

1:02:15.235 --> 1:02:16.361
let alone two.

1:02:16.361 --> 1:02:17.987
Do you have any proof?

1:02:17.987 --> 1:02:19.239
Not yet.

1:02:19.239 --> 1:02:20.740
I'm working late.
I have to get my steps in.

1:02:20.740 --> 1:02:22.200
I think it's called running.

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:23.827
No. It's called getting
your steps in when the office

1:02:23.827 --> 1:02:26.079
has a competition of who
can get the most steps in.

1:02:26.079 --> 1:02:28.248
And Kyle is killing it.

1:02:28.248 --> 1:02:29.124
See what I did there?

1:02:29.124 --> 1:02:30.500
That was pretty good.

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:33.712
Look... do your thing
but just please be careful.

1:02:33.712 --> 1:02:34.546
Okay.

1:02:41.845 --> 1:02:44.556
I'm Kyle, I get all my steps in.

1:02:48.268 --> 1:02:50.562
Kyle gets all his steps in.

1:03:01.072 --> 1:03:01.948
Hey Paula.

1:03:01.948 --> 1:03:03.283
Hey Alden.

1:03:03.283 --> 1:03:04.826
Birdie's in her office
if you're looking for her.

1:03:04.826 --> 1:03:07.245
Uh, actually,
I'm looking for you.

1:03:07.245 --> 1:03:08.705
Oh.

1:03:08.705 --> 1:03:10.665
You know how when Tim died
you said to let you know

1:03:10.665 --> 1:03:12.542
if there was anything
you could do to help?

1:03:12.542 --> 1:03:15.211
Well, I need your help.

1:03:15.211 --> 1:03:17.964
Um... you know how everybody's
been tracking their steps

1:03:17.964 --> 1:03:20.592
for that infernal
wellness challenge?

1:03:20.592 --> 1:03:23.553
I have almost hit
my goal this week.

1:03:23.553 --> 1:03:25.388
Good for you!

1:03:25.388 --> 1:03:31.061
Do you have, uh, login info for
the company tracking profile?

1:03:31.061 --> 1:03:32.729
I do.

1:03:32.729 --> 1:03:36.733
And you could pull all the GPS
data for the last... two weeks?

1:03:36.733 --> 1:03:40.570
I've got some work to do now
but I could do it later.

1:03:40.570 --> 1:03:42.280
Should I just give it to Birdie?

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:43.990
Oh. No, no, no.
Birdie's slammed.

1:03:43.990 --> 1:03:45.241
She's probably gonna
be here all night.

1:03:45.241 --> 1:03:48.078
Um... I could come back
in a couple of hours.

1:03:48.078 --> 1:03:49.579
You know what?

1:03:49.579 --> 1:03:51.748
I have errands to do
in your neighborhood.

1:03:51.748 --> 1:03:53.583
Why don't I just pop
it by tonight?

1:03:53.583 --> 1:03:54.876
That sounds perfect.

1:03:54.876 --> 1:03:56.378
- Great.
- I'll see you then.

1:03:56.378 --> 1:03:58.004
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:03:59.381 --> 1:04:00.632
Okay.

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:11.810
I need coffee. Coffee.
Yes, coffee.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:33.123
Mom?

1:04:38.128 --> 1:04:39.212
Kyle!

1:04:39.212 --> 1:04:40.422
You scared me.

1:04:40.422 --> 1:04:42.590
I see you're part
of the night crew.

1:04:42.590 --> 1:04:44.759
I'm ordering Thai.
You want in?

1:04:44.759 --> 1:04:48.221
Sure. Is anyone else
still here?

1:04:48.221 --> 1:04:50.390
No. Just you and me.

1:04:55.562 --> 1:04:57.188
Hey Paula, come on in.

1:04:57.188 --> 1:04:58.064
Hi.

1:05:09.617 --> 1:05:11.077
Of course.

1:05:11.703 --> 1:05:12.871
Something funny?

1:05:12.871 --> 1:05:14.664
Ah... no.
I mean, yes.

1:05:14.664 --> 1:05:17.167
But no.
I just realized something.

1:05:17.167 --> 1:05:20.545
Anyway, thanks for coming.
Did you bring the step data?

1:05:20.545 --> 1:05:24.841
I sure did. Why do you want it?

1:05:24.841 --> 1:05:26.843
I think I might've figured out
a way to prove

1:05:26.843 --> 1:05:28.970
there was foul play
in Tim's death.

1:05:28.970 --> 1:05:30.513
Oh! Good.

1:05:30.513 --> 1:05:33.600
Uh... here.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:34.684
Would you like something
to drink?

1:05:34.684 --> 1:05:35.685
Got any bourbon?

1:05:35.685 --> 1:05:37.103
Coming right up.

1:05:55.497 --> 1:05:57.123
I'm sorry to do this to you, Bird.

1:06:03.004 --> 1:06:05.882
They forgot your chicken satay.

1:06:05.882 --> 1:06:10.470
Oh. That is totally fine.
I will survive.

1:06:10.470 --> 1:06:11.262
You sure?

1:06:11.262 --> 1:06:12.430
Yup. Yup.

1:06:12.430 --> 1:06:13.556
Okay, if you say so.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.101
Phew.

1:06:16.101 --> 1:06:17.894
How many steps you get
in today?

1:06:17.894 --> 1:06:20.814
Uh... 5,000, and that's
with a morning run.

1:06:20.814 --> 1:06:22.190
How about you?

1:06:22.190 --> 1:06:23.525
Uh... let's see.

1:06:23.525 --> 1:06:28.238
22,477.

1:06:28.238 --> 1:06:30.573
How is that possible?

1:06:30.573 --> 1:06:32.367
I'll show you. Okay?

1:06:32.367 --> 1:06:33.785
Check this out.

1:06:35.370 --> 1:06:39.249
Okay. So you can manually enter
your steps on their back end.

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:40.166
Wait. Are you serious?

1:06:40.166 --> 1:06:41.710
Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:41.710 --> 1:06:43.795
I read their terms of service,
it's actually kind of scary.

1:06:43.795 --> 1:06:46.423
They store the GPS history
of every user.

1:06:46.423 --> 1:06:48.842
Like, you wanna see where
everyone is right now?

1:06:48.842 --> 1:06:50.593
That's a complete invasion
of privacy.

1:06:50.593 --> 1:06:51.970
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1:06:51.970 --> 1:06:53.471
But I guess since
you're already logged in...

1:06:53.471 --> 1:06:55.724
we can sneak a peek. Right?

1:06:55.724 --> 1:06:56.975
Yeah.

1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:04.941
The trick is, the step counter
tracks data using GPS.

1:07:04.941 --> 1:07:07.652
Which means I should be able
to prove unequivocally

1:07:07.652 --> 1:07:09.446
that Tim was actually murdered.

1:07:09.446 --> 1:07:11.406
Wow. Alden!

1:07:12.323 --> 1:07:13.575
You are quite the sleuth.

1:07:13.575 --> 1:07:14.701
Well...

1:07:14.701 --> 1:07:16.745
Have you told
anyone else about this?

1:07:16.745 --> 1:07:18.204
No. No, you're the first.

1:07:18.204 --> 1:07:21.124
Mmm. That's good.

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:23.710
I really wish you had let
sleeping dogs lie.

1:07:23.710 --> 1:07:25.795
Hey, that's what
the brick said.

1:07:29.466 --> 1:07:30.342
Paula?

1:07:51.863 --> 1:07:53.073
Paula?

1:07:53.073 --> 1:07:55.742
This is very impressive.

1:07:55.742 --> 1:07:57.744
I just wish someone
had spent this much time

1:07:57.744 --> 1:08:00.330
trying to find justice
for my sister, Caroline.

1:08:00.330 --> 1:08:03.333
Justice? Why, what happened?

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:06.961
What happened?

1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:10.507
You are a funny little monkey,
aren't you, Alden?

1:08:10.507 --> 1:08:13.593
Look, Paula. Whatever happened
to your sister Caroline,

1:08:13.593 --> 1:08:15.220
I would've helped, I swear.

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.888
No you wouldn't have!

1:08:16.888 --> 1:08:19.641
You would've been too scared of
Lean McGuiness and his thugs.

1:08:19.641 --> 1:08:22.602
You would've kept your mouth
shut just like everyone else.

1:08:22.602 --> 1:08:24.771
Everyone knew who killed her

1:08:24.771 --> 1:08:27.107
but they didn't do anything
about it.

1:08:27.107 --> 1:08:29.693
She deserves justice.

1:08:29.693 --> 1:08:30.652
Huh?

1:08:32.696 --> 1:08:35.699
You've been on my tail
this whole time.

1:08:35.699 --> 1:08:36.658
I have?

1:08:39.035 --> 1:08:42.747
Oh... I have.

1:08:42.747 --> 1:08:46.292
Because Kyle didn't kill
Lean McGuiness.

1:08:46.292 --> 1:08:48.378
You did.

1:08:48.378 --> 1:08:50.588
And the GPS
would've proven that.

1:08:54.384 --> 1:08:55.218
So, look at this.

1:08:55.218 --> 1:08:56.261
Okay? So that's you and me.

1:08:56.261 --> 1:08:57.554
Okay.

1:08:57.554 --> 1:08:59.472
Uh... that's your mom.

1:08:59.472 --> 1:09:02.267
And... Paula is...

1:09:02.267 --> 1:09:03.601
At my house.
That's weird.

1:09:03.601 --> 1:09:05.061
Yeah.

1:09:05.061 --> 1:09:07.689
Wait. You said they store
people's GPS history, right?

1:09:07.689 --> 1:09:09.107
Mmhmm.

1:09:09.107 --> 1:09:11.818
So can you see where everyone
was the night Tim died?

1:09:11.818 --> 1:09:13.695
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:18.992
Wow. I... I can't believe I
never thought of this before.

1:09:18.992 --> 1:09:20.035
Let's see here.

1:09:22.954 --> 1:09:24.456
That's me finding Tim.

1:09:28.126 --> 1:09:29.502
Wait a second.

1:09:31.296 --> 1:09:34.257
Paula was there too.

1:09:34.257 --> 1:09:37.218
And she's leaving through
the back door.

1:09:37.218 --> 1:09:38.470
Does that mean...

1:09:39.554 --> 1:09:42.057
Paula killed Tim?

1:09:42.057 --> 1:09:43.558
Yeah.

1:09:43.558 --> 1:09:44.976
I think it does.

1:09:46.811 --> 1:09:47.812
Alden.

1:09:48.897 --> 1:09:50.732
Oh my gosh! Alden!

1:09:59.657 --> 1:10:03.620
That's my mom, don't answer.
She is a talker.

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:06.831
Oh. Let's let that go
to voicemail.

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:11.461
This is Alden.

1:10:11.461 --> 1:10:12.962
I can't come to
the phone right now.

1:10:12.962 --> 1:10:14.047
Leave a message.

1:10:14.047 --> 1:10:16.716
Alden! Alden! It was Paula
all along.

1:10:16.716 --> 1:10:17.801
Call me.

1:10:17.801 --> 1:10:19.386
Now...

1:10:19.386 --> 1:10:20.970
What to do with you?

1:10:20.970 --> 1:10:22.806
Look, what do you say
you cut me loose,

1:10:22.806 --> 1:10:24.516
we mosey on down
to the Side Saddle,

1:10:24.516 --> 1:10:26.726
we go halfsies on a basket
of jalapeño poppers

1:10:26.726 --> 1:10:29.354
and we just put this whole
thing behind us. Huh?

1:10:29.354 --> 1:10:30.980
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

1:10:30.980 --> 1:10:32.315
It is!

1:10:32.315 --> 1:10:37.237
That monster killed my sweet
sister 33 years ago.

1:10:37.237 --> 1:10:39.239
She was just walking
home one day,

1:10:39.239 --> 1:10:40.573
took a shortcut down an alley

1:10:40.573 --> 1:10:43.034
and saw something
she shouldn't have.

1:10:43.034 --> 1:10:44.953
And she was gone.

1:10:44.953 --> 1:10:47.372
They found her body
two weeks later.

1:10:47.372 --> 1:10:50.500
Two weeks later!

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:51.793
I'm really sorry
about your sister

1:10:51.793 --> 1:10:53.169
but you don't have to hurt me.

1:10:53.169 --> 1:10:54.337
I didn't do anything.

1:10:54.337 --> 1:10:55.672
But you did!

1:10:55.672 --> 1:10:57.966
You got in the way!

1:10:57.966 --> 1:11:00.135
I did everyone a favor
by killing Lean.

1:11:01.970 --> 1:11:06.224
And now... I have to do
something with you.

1:11:06.224 --> 1:11:07.934
No you don't.
No you don't!

1:11:10.270 --> 1:11:11.938
Does Birdie have
any bleach?

1:11:13.898 --> 1:11:14.941
Bleach?

1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:16.484
What's this?

1:11:16.484 --> 1:11:17.777
No, no, no.

1:11:19.070 --> 1:11:20.947
Really? Now you're fixing
the street?

1:11:25.285 --> 1:11:28.246
This is not happening, this is
not happening. Okay. Just...

1:11:28.246 --> 1:11:29.414
Hey!

1:11:29.414 --> 1:11:30.540
Hang in there, baby.
Birdie's coming.

1:11:34.044 --> 1:11:37.297
Now that I think about it,
we don't have any bleach.

1:11:37.297 --> 1:11:40.050
We only use Earth friendly
non-toxic cleaning products

1:11:40.050 --> 1:11:41.092
in this house.

1:11:41.092 --> 1:11:42.218
We're on sort of a...
a new green...

1:11:42.218 --> 1:11:43.803
Never mind.

1:11:43.803 --> 1:11:47.390
I found drain cleaner, floor
polish and some laundry pods.

1:11:47.390 --> 1:11:50.352
Uh... you know me,
Mr. Curious.

1:11:50.352 --> 1:11:52.145
Why did you have
to kill Tim too?

1:11:52.687 --> 1:11:55.273
I went to the office
to scare Tim

1:11:55.273 --> 1:11:57.942
but he was gonna turn me in.

1:11:57.942 --> 1:12:01.946
So Tim had to be put out
to pasture

1:12:01.946 --> 1:12:05.950
because he figured things out
and wouldn't let it just be.

1:12:05.950 --> 1:12:09.913
You all assumed that Tim went
to the apartments by himself.

1:12:09.913 --> 1:12:10.789
Ha!

1:12:10.789 --> 1:12:12.415
I'm always with Tim.

1:12:12.415 --> 1:12:14.501
But nobody ever sees Paula.

1:12:14.501 --> 1:12:18.088
I was with Tim,
like I always was,

1:12:18.088 --> 1:12:22.384
when he went door to door
at the Cecil Bay Apartments.

1:12:22.384 --> 1:12:25.720
And when we went
to apartment 101

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:28.306
and Mr. Frederick Gasko
came to the door,

1:12:28.306 --> 1:12:30.934
I knew instantly
who he was.

1:12:30.934 --> 1:12:34.187
This old block of wood
doesn't forget a face.

1:12:34.187 --> 1:12:35.438
So I went back.

1:12:37.774 --> 1:12:40.652
To Mr. Gasko with
my trusty zapper

1:12:40.652 --> 1:12:42.946
and I gave him a send-off
that he deserved.

1:12:44.239 --> 1:12:46.658
I would've said shock
of his life, but...

1:12:46.658 --> 1:12:47.784
no time for humor.

1:12:47.784 --> 1:12:49.452
What are you gonna do with that?

1:12:49.452 --> 1:12:50.495
What are you doing?

1:12:50.495 --> 1:12:51.496
No, no, no.
No, no.

1:12:51.496 --> 1:12:52.706
No. No.

1:12:52.706 --> 1:12:53.748
Take a sip.
You'll go right to sleep.

1:12:53.748 --> 1:12:55.291
Nuh uh.
Oh, that smells terrible.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:58.336
You know, we could do this
the easy way or the hard way.

1:12:59.337 --> 1:13:00.380
Look at me.

1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:02.340
Look around you.

1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:04.926
I'm a 38-year-old private
investigator in training.

1:13:04.926 --> 1:13:07.137
I don't do anything
the easy way.

1:13:07.137 --> 1:13:08.430
Have it your way.

1:13:09.681 --> 1:13:11.016
What does that mean?

1:13:11.850 --> 1:13:13.184
Paula, what does that mean?!

1:13:14.936 --> 1:13:17.397
Uh... So... so... so,
you drove to Rhode Island

1:13:17.397 --> 1:13:18.648
with Lean's body
in your car

1:13:18.648 --> 1:13:19.816
and you dumped it at
the construction site

1:13:19.816 --> 1:13:21.484
to make it look like a mob hit.

1:13:21.484 --> 1:13:23.695
But why was Kyle wearing
the T-shirt?

1:13:23.695 --> 1:13:25.530
Kyle's uncle owns
Ado Construction.

1:13:25.530 --> 1:13:27.198
Yeah.

1:13:27.198 --> 1:13:28.450
You'd be hard-pressed
to find a construction site

1:13:28.450 --> 1:13:30.368
in Rhode Island that wasn't done
by them.

1:13:30.368 --> 1:13:31.619
It was a happy accident.

1:13:31.619 --> 1:13:34.539
Oh... Uh huh.

1:13:34.539 --> 1:13:38.126
And, uh... how did Tim
figure it out?

1:13:38.126 --> 1:13:41.004
Tim knew my sister
was killed by Lean McGuiness

1:13:41.004 --> 1:13:44.007
and when they found his body
he put two and two together.

1:13:44.007 --> 1:13:46.926
We were the only people
who knew Lean's hiding place.

1:13:46.926 --> 1:13:49.179
Help me out here.
Any ideas?

1:13:49.179 --> 1:13:50.221
What?

1:13:51.514 --> 1:13:52.849
Man, you're good.

1:13:52.849 --> 1:13:55.435
Tim was gonna go
to the FBI about me,

1:13:55.435 --> 1:13:58.772
and they would've found me,
so he had to be silenced.

1:14:06.196 --> 1:14:07.197
No.

1:14:08.281 --> 1:14:10.033
Yes!

1:14:12.452 --> 1:14:13.453
Help me! Help!

1:14:13.453 --> 1:14:14.621
Help!

1:14:14.621 --> 1:14:15.705
No one is coming
to save you, Alden.

1:14:15.705 --> 1:14:16.664
No, no, no, no, no.

1:14:16.664 --> 1:14:17.749
Help!

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:21.544
No, no, no. Paula. Paula.

1:14:21.544 --> 1:14:24.673
P...P...P...

1:14:24.673 --> 1:14:25.840
What about Birdie?

1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:26.883
Think about...
think about Birdie.

1:14:26.883 --> 1:14:28.426
Sweet little...
sweet little Birdie.

1:14:28.426 --> 1:14:29.678
I know, poor Birdie.

1:14:29.678 --> 1:14:31.221
Right?

1:14:31.221 --> 1:14:33.890
Don't worry, I am gonna be there
to help her through this.

1:14:33.890 --> 1:14:35.141
That's not really
what I had in mind.

1:14:35.141 --> 1:14:36.351
And now...

1:14:36.351 --> 1:14:39.479
it's time for heaven
to get another angel.

1:14:39.479 --> 1:14:40.397
Nuh uh.

1:14:40.397 --> 1:14:41.398
- Open up.
- Mm.

1:14:41.398 --> 1:14:43.149
- Mm.
- Open up! Open!

1:14:43.149 --> 1:14:44.776
- Open up.
- Mm.

1:14:44.776 --> 1:14:45.860
- Open up!
- Mm.

1:14:48.905 --> 1:14:49.572
Mm. Mm. Mm...

1:14:49.572 --> 1:14:51.950
- Open up, Alden!
- Mm.

1:14:51.950 --> 1:14:52.826
Alden?

1:14:53.368 --> 1:14:54.869
In here!

1:14:54.869 --> 1:14:55.870
Freeze!

1:14:55.870 --> 1:14:56.996
Who are you?

1:14:56.996 --> 1:14:58.206
That's Rick.

1:14:58.206 --> 1:15:00.083
Drop the... turkey baster.

1:15:03.294 --> 1:15:04.713
Get her! Get her! Get her!

1:15:05.380 --> 1:15:06.589
Get her!

1:15:07.132 --> 1:15:08.049
Natbot!

1:15:10.051 --> 1:15:10.969
Get her, Rick!

1:15:10.969 --> 1:15:12.303
Got you.

1:15:12.303 --> 1:15:13.221
Get her!

1:15:13.221 --> 1:15:14.180
Let me go!

1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:15.849
Come on, get up.

1:15:15.849 --> 1:15:16.975
- Get her, Rick.
- Get off of me!

1:15:16.975 --> 1:15:18.435
Show her who's boss.
Get her!

1:15:18.435 --> 1:15:20.478
There you go.
You got her.

1:15:20.478 --> 1:15:22.689
We did it!

1:15:23.773 --> 1:15:26.276
I knew it was you in the blue
sedan the whole time.

1:15:26.276 --> 1:15:29.320
Alden! Are you okay?

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:31.406
Birdie! Natbot.

1:15:32.407 --> 1:15:33.408
- Alden?
- Birdie!

1:15:33.408 --> 1:15:34.284
Alden?

1:15:35.994 --> 1:15:36.995
Alden?

1:15:36.995 --> 1:15:38.079
Hi honey.

1:15:40.165 --> 1:15:42.083
Tonight, a bizarre ending
to the mystery

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:44.753
surrounding the fate
of Lean McGuiness.

1:15:44.753 --> 1:15:46.504
We're hearing that
Paula Saint Gervais,

1:15:46.504 --> 1:15:48.465
who's sister,
Caroline Saint Gervais,

1:15:48.465 --> 1:15:51.009
was killed by Lean McGuiness
in 1987...

1:15:51.009 --> 1:15:53.803
Well, I told them all about
the GPS.

1:15:53.803 --> 1:15:55.263
That should seal things up.

1:15:55.263 --> 1:15:56.765
Thanks, man.

1:15:56.765 --> 1:15:59.851
Hey, I'm really glad it was me
you chose to follow.

1:15:59.851 --> 1:16:02.562
Well, yeah.
You did good, glasses.

1:16:03.813 --> 1:16:05.273
Looks like you finally got
your feet wet.

1:16:05.273 --> 1:16:06.775
Thanks Detective.

1:16:07.942 --> 1:16:09.027
- Don't.
- Yeah, it's...

1:16:09.402 --> 1:16:11.029
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:12.572 --> 1:16:13.782
Did you just make
a new friend?

1:16:13.782 --> 1:16:15.158
I don't know if
I'd go that far.

1:16:16.493 --> 1:16:17.786
Before they take her away,

1:16:17.786 --> 1:16:19.371
there's something
that's been bothering me.

1:16:19.371 --> 1:16:20.372
Wait. What do you mean?

1:16:20.372 --> 1:16:22.499
Officer! Wait, one sec.

1:16:22.499 --> 1:16:24.959
I need to Columbo her.

1:16:24.959 --> 1:16:27.128
Hey Paula, how did
you get Lean's body

1:16:27.128 --> 1:16:28.838
into the car that night?

1:16:28.838 --> 1:16:30.382
I didn't have a plan
for that.

1:16:32.258 --> 1:16:33.677
When I got to
the apartment building

1:16:33.677 --> 1:16:36.012
there was a wheelchair
sitting there.

1:16:36.012 --> 1:16:39.974
Of course! Mrs. Carmopolis'
wheelchair.

1:16:39.974 --> 1:16:41.351
Yes!

1:16:41.351 --> 1:16:46.356
Well, I think we're done here.
Take 'er away, boys.

1:16:48.650 --> 1:16:50.527
I've always wanted
to do that.

1:16:50.527 --> 1:16:52.278
You were made for this.

1:16:59.369 --> 1:17:00.537
I'm so happy to see you.

1:17:00.537 --> 1:17:02.288
I know.

1:17:02.288 --> 1:17:04.541
Authorities aren't releasing
any more details at this time.

1:17:04.541 --> 1:17:07.877
But my sources tell me
the case was solved

1:17:07.877 --> 1:17:12.090
by a local husband and wife
private investigation team.

1:17:13.299 --> 1:17:16.553
So... how does it feel?

1:17:16.553 --> 1:17:18.096
Ah, it's a little sore.

1:17:18.096 --> 1:17:21.016
No. How does it feel
to solve the case?

1:17:21.016 --> 1:17:22.183
Oh...

1:17:22.183 --> 1:17:24.853
I... I can't believe
we solved it.

1:17:24.853 --> 1:17:26.730
- We did it!
- I know.

1:17:29.649 --> 1:17:31.484
Mmm.

1:17:31.484 --> 1:17:32.402
That hits the spot.

1:17:32.402 --> 1:17:33.528
- It's pretty good.
- Mmhmm.

1:17:33.528 --> 1:17:34.863
So tell me...

1:17:35.864 --> 1:17:37.449
When we got married,

1:17:37.449 --> 1:17:40.160
is this what you imagined
your life would be like?

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:42.328
Oh, not at all.

1:17:42.328 --> 1:17:43.705
This?

1:17:43.705 --> 1:17:45.206
Way better.

1:17:45.206 --> 1:17:46.541
Hmm.

1:17:46.541 --> 1:17:48.251
'Cause I get to do it with you.

1:17:55.759 --> 1:17:57.385
What's this?

1:17:57.385 --> 1:17:59.512
It was our divorce papers.

1:18:12.650 --> 1:18:14.778
- No more secrets.
- No more secrets.

1:18:31.795 --> 1:18:33.588
I love you, baby bird.

1:18:33.588 --> 1:18:35.298
I love you, big bird.

1:18:42.138 --> 1:18:43.348
Babe. Come on.

1:18:43.348 --> 1:18:44.683
We can't be
late for my mom.

1:18:44.683 --> 1:18:46.017
Well, the door's not
gonna lock itself.

1:18:46.017 --> 1:18:47.769
I know, but you know how
punctual she is.

1:18:47.769 --> 1:18:48.978
Okay? I just...

1:18:48.978 --> 1:18:50.230
I know. I mean,
safety first.

1:18:50.230 --> 1:18:51.481
Are you the Case's?

1:18:53.650 --> 1:18:55.318
Who... who's asking?

1:18:55.318 --> 1:18:57.112
I'm Johnny D'Rossi.

1:18:57.112 --> 1:19:00.448
My family owns the wine
and cheese store on Fifth.

1:19:00.448 --> 1:19:01.741
Mmhmm.

1:19:01.741 --> 1:19:03.451
Oh. You guys have
great pickles.

1:19:03.451 --> 1:19:04.494
Thank you.

1:19:07.372 --> 1:19:09.332
This is for you.

1:19:12.293 --> 1:19:13.336
It's a ham.

1:19:14.421 --> 1:19:15.714
Oh.

1:19:15.714 --> 1:19:16.923
Bone in.

1:19:18.258 --> 1:19:21.302
I spent a lot of years
with Lean McGuiness.

1:19:21.302 --> 1:19:22.303
Too many.

1:19:24.014 --> 1:19:26.099
But his murder had a lot of
people worked up

1:19:26.099 --> 1:19:30.395
and what you did
prevented more bloodshed.

1:19:30.395 --> 1:19:35.233
You ever need a favor,
you come by the store.

1:19:35.233 --> 1:19:37.986
Your husband, he did
a great service.

1:19:37.986 --> 1:19:41.197
Actually, uh...
we're partners.

1:19:41.197 --> 1:19:43.450
Hmm? Oh...

1:19:43.450 --> 1:19:45.368
Well then, you're lucky you
two have found each other.

1:19:45.368 --> 1:19:47.370
Yeah. We are.

1:19:52.208 --> 1:19:56.421
So... was that really Johnny
"Palm Trees" D'Rossi?

1:19:56.421 --> 1:19:57.756
Yup.

1:19:57.756 --> 1:19:59.841
Of the D'Rossi
crime family?

1:19:59.841 --> 1:20:01.426
Mmhmm.

1:20:01.426 --> 1:20:04.137
And the giver of fine hams.

1:20:08.224 --> 1:20:09.392
Oh, this ham's
really heavy.

1:20:09.392 --> 1:20:10.185
Hi.

1:20:10.185 --> 1:20:11.644
Birdie. Alden.

1:20:11.644 --> 1:20:15.023
Mrs. Grant reached out and
wanted to speak to you both.

1:20:15.023 --> 1:20:16.649
What are you holding?

1:20:16.649 --> 1:20:17.609
Mobster ham!

1:20:19.778 --> 1:20:22.614
Oh, Mrs. Grant.
It's nice to see you again.

1:20:22.614 --> 1:20:26.409
I wanted to formally express
my gratitude to you both.

1:20:26.409 --> 1:20:30.246
Tim has considered this firm to
be part of his extended family

1:20:30.246 --> 1:20:34.209
and I am so grateful for your
diligent work to find the truth.

1:20:34.209 --> 1:20:36.670
Well, it's the least
we could do for Tim.

1:20:36.670 --> 1:20:41.216
Because Tim's death has been
reclassified as a homicide,

1:20:41.216 --> 1:20:43.843
his life insurance policy
is no longer void.

1:20:43.843 --> 1:20:46.638
And I think that Timmy
would want you...

1:20:48.431 --> 1:20:49.933
to have this.

1:20:54.896 --> 1:20:56.356
A million dollars?

1:20:56.356 --> 1:20:57.524
It's a $100,000.

1:20:57.524 --> 1:20:58.942
$100,000?!

1:21:00.276 --> 1:21:03.571
This is... I... I don't even...

1:21:03.571 --> 1:21:05.156
Thank you.

1:21:05.156 --> 1:21:07.617
Maybe that will help you get
your investigation business

1:21:07.617 --> 1:21:09.369
off the ground.

1:21:09.369 --> 1:21:12.747
That is so generous.
Thank you very much.

1:21:12.747 --> 1:21:13.957
And I'll be in charge
of the accounting.

1:21:13.957 --> 1:21:15.208
Absolutely.

1:21:16.376 --> 1:21:17.460
Detective.

1:21:18.753 --> 1:21:20.213
Good work you two.

1:21:20.797 --> 1:21:23.466
You know, Penelope was right.

1:21:23.466 --> 1:21:24.801
You keep this going,

1:21:24.801 --> 1:21:26.970
I might have a few clients
to send your way myself.

1:21:26.970 --> 1:21:31.850
Eleonore? Is that actual
approval I'm hearing?

1:21:31.850 --> 1:21:33.309
Something like that.

1:21:34.686 --> 1:21:36.104
Hmm.

1:21:36.104 --> 1:21:37.689
So I'll see you tonight?

1:21:37.689 --> 1:21:38.648
Tonight.

1:21:38.648 --> 1:21:39.482
Mmm.

1:21:41.776 --> 1:21:43.319
Can't wait.

1:21:46.489 --> 1:21:48.491
Birdie. One second.

1:21:49.701 --> 1:21:53.955
Penelope was very impressed
with what you and Alden did.

1:21:53.955 --> 1:21:56.499
You two seem... better.

1:21:56.499 --> 1:21:57.667
We are.

1:22:00.003 --> 1:22:03.256
Hey, Mom. I mean... Eleonore.

1:22:03.256 --> 1:22:05.550
I'm sorry that I was so
distracted around here.

1:22:05.550 --> 1:22:06.968
No.

1:22:06.968 --> 1:22:09.137
I'm the one that should
be apologizing.

1:22:09.137 --> 1:22:11.556
I can admit that I pushed
you too hard,

1:22:11.556 --> 1:22:14.476
and what I don't wanna do
is push you away.

1:22:16.853 --> 1:22:18.980
I think this is where we hug.

1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:20.732
Not in the office, dear.

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:30.617
Missing persons investigations.

1:22:30.617 --> 1:22:31.618
Who...

1:22:32.660 --> 1:22:34.287
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1:22:34.746 --> 1:22:35.872
Oh, hi. Come on in.

1:22:35.872 --> 1:22:37.165
Thanks.

1:22:37.165 --> 1:22:41.252
Mrs. Case,
glad you could make it.

1:22:41.252 --> 1:22:42.212
Hi.

1:22:42.212 --> 1:22:43.838
- Okay...
- Thank you.

1:22:43.838 --> 1:22:46.675
Missing persons investigations.

1:22:46.675 --> 1:22:50.428
Who knows where to start
with something like this?

1:22:56.851 --> 1:22:59.020
I mean, everyone is
saying that Rick is the hero,

1:22:59.020 --> 1:23:00.939
but when you think about it,

1:23:00.939 --> 1:23:02.982
he was just sitting in his car
the whole time.

1:23:02.982 --> 1:23:05.527
Well, I mean, he did kinda...
you know...

1:23:05.527 --> 1:23:07.237
save your life.

1:23:07.237 --> 1:23:08.321
Well...

1:23:11.991 --> 1:23:13.743
Are you
expecting somebody?

1:23:13.743 --> 1:23:15.120
No.

1:23:17.580 --> 1:23:18.581
Hello?

1:23:18.581 --> 1:23:20.208
Mr. And Mrs. Case.

1:23:20.208 --> 1:23:23.461
I got your name
from Penelope Grant.

1:23:23.461 --> 1:23:24.462
I need your help.

1:23:24.462 --> 1:23:26.840
- Of course. Come on in.
- Thanks.

1:23:31.761 --> 1:23:34.889
So... how can we help?

1:23:34.889 --> 1:23:36.474
I don't even know
where to start.
