Hi, Dad.

00:05.549 --> 00:07.550
It's my first New Year's Eve

00:03.546 --> 00:07.550
in Times Square.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.277
- It's kind of like being
- on a battlefield,

00:09.301 --> 00:10.657
But the projectiles are

00:10.658 --> 00:12.012
streamers and vomit.

00:13.389 --> 00:14.724
Jessie, I got

00:14.725 --> 00:16.058
a great souvenir

00:13.389 --> 00:16.058
from the concert.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.727
- What? A T-shirt?
- A CD?

00:17.852 --> 00:21.146
No. Austin Moon's shoe.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.920
Alrighty. Please tell me

00:22.921 --> 00:24.567
you don't have his foot

00:21.272 --> 00:24.567
in your pocket.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.319
Eww. No.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.821
That would be weird.

00:29.614 --> 00:30.823
Wouldn't it, Lefty?

- Jessie.

Bertram, I told you

00:35.245 --> 00:36.412
to stay home with the kids

00:36.537 --> 00:37.890
- while I took Emma
- to the concert.

00:37.914 --> 00:39.061
They wanted to come too,

00:39.062 --> 00:40.207
so they tricked me.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.605
They told me

00:41.606 --> 00:42.877
98 Degrees was

00:40.332 --> 00:42.877
performing.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.879
- But, instead,
- it's 9.8 degrees.

00:45.922 --> 00:47.757
- And now
- we've lost Zuri.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.155
What? What do you mean,

00:49.156 --> 00:50.426
you lost Zuri?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.719
We had her,

00:51.720 --> 00:52.887
now we don't.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.887
Keep up.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.140
- Well, we should
- alert security.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.058

07:54.225 --> 07:55.976
- I know everything
- about you.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.477
- Your favorite color
- is orange,

07:57.602 --> 07:58.962
- Your favorite food
- is pancakes,

07:59.063 --> 08:01.023
- And your favorite
- marsupial is the wallaby.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.151
- You have
- a favorite marsupial?

08:04.276 --> 08:05.569
You don't?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.655
(PURRING)

08:08.780 --> 08:10.490
(SCREAMING)

08:10.615 --> 08:11.700
Mrs. Kipling,

08:11.701 --> 08:12.784
the movie is starting.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.203
Settle in next to me,

08:14.328 --> 08:15.580
and make sure your

08:15.581 --> 08:16.830
cell phone is on vibrate.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.896
Hey, I think

08:19.897 --> 08:21.668
she likes me.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.545
Huh. That's weird.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.297
She always sits next

08:21.793 --> 08:25.297
to you during movies.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.550
Well, I mean,

08:27.551 --> 08:29.676
it is not like there is

08:25.423 --> 08:29.676
a seating chart or anything.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.806
Really?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.684
- If you were just
- a little bit taller

08:39.352 --> 08:40.854
And the right species.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.334
- And they think
- New Yorkers are weird?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.263
- Hey, did you finish
- your poem for school?

08:56.287 --> 08:57.580
Yup. It's about

08:57.581 --> 08:58.872
imaginary friends.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.458
Oh, great.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.185
- Meanwhile, I'm having
- trouble deciding

09:02.209 --> 09:03.919
- Which one of my songs
- to show Austin.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.358
It's like asking me to

09:05.359 --> 09:06.671
pick which one of you kids

09:04.044 --> 09:06.671
is my favorite.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.132
Let me make this

09:08.133 --> 09:09.467
easy for you.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.760
I'm cute, sweet,

09:11.761 --> 09:13.929
and I have a really sharp

09:09.591 --> 09:13.929
crayon in my hand.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.266
And we have a winner.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.314
So you see, if you

09:23.315 --> 09:24.982
really want to grow

09:21.645 --> 09:24.982
your fan base,

09:25.107 --> 09:26.380
the key is to exploit

09:26.381 --> 09:27.651
your yummy factor

09:27.776 --> 09:29.507
while maintaining

09:29.508 --> 09:31.238
a believable degree

09:27.776 --> 09:31.238
of humility.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.845
I call it the

09:32.846 --> 09:34.325
hunky-to-humble ratio.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.286
- Trish, are you
- taking notes?

09:37.411 --> 09:38.496
You bet.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.790
(SIGHS)

09:43.625 --> 09:45.252
Don't hold back, Hans.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.715
Oh. And remember to

09:48.716 --> 09:50.007
charge all this

09:47.421 --> 09:50.007
to the penthouse.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.094
And now I'm gonna go

09:54.095 --> 09:56.096
get my scale model of the

09:52.092 --> 09:56.096
Austin World theme park.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.286
Wait 'til you see

09:57.287 --> 09:58.349
the Moon-Flume.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.394
- You better not leave any
- hairs behind.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.001
She has enough money

10:04.002 --> 10:05.481
to clone you.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.004
Hi, guys,

10:07.005 --> 10:08.359
glad you're making

10:05.647 --> 10:08.359
yourselves at home.

10:08.484 --> 10:09.609
Oh, hey, Hans.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.175
So, what would you guys

10:12.176 --> 10:13.447
say if I told you that

10:13.572 --> 10:15.220
the world's

10:15.221 --> 10:16.867
greatest songwriter was

10:13.572 --> 10:16.867
right here in this very room?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.618
Aw, thanks, Jessie.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.388
- I really try to capture - the essence of
- The human...

10:20.412 --> 10:21.852
Yeah.

10:21.853 --> 10:23.290
Talkin' about me here.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.980
Austin, I was wondering if

10:24.981 --> 10:26.544
you guys could look at

10:23.415 --> 10:26.544
some of my lyrics?

10:26.668 --> 10:28.525
Actually,

10:28.526 --> 10:30.381
Austin and I write all of

10:26.668 --> 10:30.381
our own material.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.343
But, we'll have plenty

10:33.344 --> 10:36.178
of time to look these over

10:30.506 --> 10:36.178
on the private jet,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.222
- you know, the one with
- the free omelet bar?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.473
Maybe they have

10:39.474 --> 10:40.599
a pancake bar.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.476
Oh, we do.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.814
TRISH: Wow.

10:46.815 --> 10:48.023
Jessie's lyrics stink.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.483
Oh, wait, hang on.

10:49.484 --> 10:50.817
This one's not bad.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.779
Actually, it's really good.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.032
Uh, hey, Jess...

10:57.157 --> 10:59.034
- So, did you
- love them?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.537
We loved one of them.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.330
- I'm fine with
- being a one-hit wonder.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.417
- It just needs
- a professional touch.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.382
- Ally would be happy
- to work on it with you.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.669
- Really?
- Really?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.671
Oh!

11:11.796 --> 11:13.048
- You know,
- I'm a singer, too.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.341
Sort of a double threat.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.093
- Triple, if you
- count Krav Maga.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.386
Hi-ya!

11:19.971 --> 11:21.640
Good to know.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.850
Perhaps we can talk

11:22.851 --> 11:23.934
about this at the

11:21.765 --> 11:23.934
day spa downstairs?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.227
Absolutely.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.375
And if you throw in

11:26.376 --> 11:27.396
a free oxygen facial,

11:27.521 --> 11:29.065
maybe you guys can

11:29.066 --> 11:30.608
sing this song as a duet

11:27.521 --> 11:30.608
at Austin's next concert.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.317
Done.

11:32.318 --> 11:33.902
Where's the concert?

11:30.732 --> 11:33.902
Madison Square Garden?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.446
Close.

11:35.447 --> 11:36.863
Our local mall

11:34.027 --> 11:36.863
in Miami.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.283
Oh. I don't know.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.868
It's kind of short notice

11:38.698 --> 11:41.868
to take the kids to Mia...

11:41.993 --> 11:43.245
Bon voyage.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.707
- Really? - You already had
- Our bags packed?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.167
- I always keep
- them packed.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.169
- I've also included
- your passports.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.714
May I suggest a

11:52.715 --> 11:54.131
lovely cruise through

11:51.295 --> 11:54.131
the Bermuda Triangle?

12:01.138 --> 12:02.473
Alrighty then.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.828
Sunshine and stardom,

12:03.829 --> 12:05.058
here we come.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.560
Jessie,

12:06.561 --> 12:07.936
I really love

12:05.183 --> 12:07.936
these lyrics.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.188
"Imaginary friends

12:09.189 --> 12:10.314
can't take the place

12:10.439 --> 12:11.920
"of you and me

12:11.921 --> 12:13.400
just talking

12:10.439 --> 12:13.400
face to face."

12:13.525 --> 12:15.257
How did you

12:15.258 --> 12:16.987
come up with that?

12:17.112 --> 12:20.220
Oh, uh, I guess

12:20.221 --> 12:23.327
I'm just really in touch

12:17.112 --> 12:23.327
with my inner child.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.869
- That's why I
- wrote it in crayon.

Guys, this is a dream

12:44.181 --> 12:46.933
come true for me.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.560
And, we're gonna

12:48.561 --> 12:50.061
make sure everybody knows

12:47.058 --> 12:50.061
you wrote the lyrics.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.900
Uh, maybe we should do

12:54.901 --> 12:57.235
a completely different song.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.529
I have this one

12:58.530 --> 12:59.697
about a girl and

12:57.361 --> 12:59.697
her flamethrower.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.062
- It's a torch song.
- And it...

13:01.156 --> 13:02.908
Jessie, the thing about

13:02.909 --> 13:04.660
your other songs is...

13:06.578 --> 13:08.579
- Have I mentioned - you're a really
- Great nanny?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.146
What's important is,

13:11.147 --> 13:12.376
this one's great.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.461
- So let's take it again
- from the top.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.713
- Hi.
- JESSIE: No.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.047
Uh...

13:20.425 --> 13:22.093
Why did you do that?

13:22.219 --> 13:23.992
Because you're guitar

13:23.993 --> 13:25.764
was out of tune.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.203
Wait, these aren't

13:27.204 --> 13:28.517
tuning scissors?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.602
- (SCOFFS) - What kind of a
- Music store is this?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.462
Oh. Oh, are those

13:36.463 --> 13:37.609
some new lyrics?

13:37.735 --> 13:39.403
- No, it's a bill
- for the strings.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.014
Zuri, I thought I

13:46.015 --> 13:47.578
sent you to watch

13:44.449 --> 13:47.578
that shuffleboard contest.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.580
- It was just
- a bunch of old people

13:49.705 --> 13:50.768
Pushing something around

13:50.769 --> 13:51.831
with a stick.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.229
It was like hockey,

13:53.230 --> 13:54.501
but slower.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.336
- And the fights
- were just sad.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.740
- Hey, Zuri,
- wanna hear our song?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.840
JESSIE: Uh...

14:02.801 --> 14:03.885
Oh, no. No.

14:08.599 --> 14:09.725
Jessie.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.122
What? I thought we

14:11.123 --> 14:12.394
needed some theatrics.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.104
- Rock n' roll!
- Am I right?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.649
- Should I just
- start you a tab?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.090
Um, hey, Zuri,

14:21.091 --> 14:22.821
why don't we go help Trish

14:19.359 --> 14:22.821
set up the stage?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.591
- You always wanted to
- be a roadie, right?

14:24.615 --> 14:26.408
Yeah, for Lady Antebellum.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.351
Austin, I had this made

14:31.352 --> 14:33.123
so your fans can

14:29.578 --> 14:33.123
take a picture with you,

14:33.248 --> 14:34.271
but you won't have to

14:34.272 --> 14:35.292
get too close to them.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.940
Thanks, but I enjoy

14:36.941 --> 14:38.462
taking pictures

14:35.417 --> 14:38.462
with my fans.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.088
- You have to
- be careful, though.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.861
Some of them

14:41.862 --> 14:43.508
are a little bit...

14:40.213 --> 14:43.508
Cuckoo!

14:48.513 --> 14:49.765
You do not want to

14:49.766 --> 14:51.015
get burned, Mrs. Kipling.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.456
The only red on your snout

14:53.457 --> 14:55.771
should be from the blood

14:51.141 --> 14:55.771
of your victims.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.938
(SCREAMING)

14:59.775 --> 15:00.881
You are one big can

15:00.882 --> 15:01.985
of girl repellent.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.904
So, little dudes.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.177
What cool Miami sights

15:06.178 --> 15:07.324
can I show you first?

15:07.449 --> 15:08.513
Uh, the world's largest

15:08.514 --> 15:09.576
bottle of sunscreen,

15:09.701 --> 15:10.890
a manatee that looks

15:10.891 --> 15:12.078
like Ernest Hemingway?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.499
Oh. The Vanilla Ice Museum?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.041
(BEATBOXING)

15:18.794 --> 15:20.170
This guy is nuttier

15:20.171 --> 15:21.546
than a Porta-Potty

15:18.794 --> 15:21.546
on a peanut farm.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.424
True dat.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.699
Thank you, Mr. Dez,

15:27.700 --> 15:29.179
but we have other plans.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.723
(MRS. KIPLING PURRS)

15:31.849 --> 15:33.224
Mrs. Kipling?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.353
Hmm.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.815
Looks like someone

15:39.816 --> 15:41.483
can't get enough of

15:38.146 --> 15:41.483
the Dez-meister.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.446
Maybe we could all

15:45.447 --> 15:46.488
go to the beach.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.450
Great idea.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.140
Perhaps I could

15:52.141 --> 15:53.704
bury you in the sand

15:50.575 --> 15:53.704
up to your neck

15:53.829 --> 15:55.455
and the crabs will

15:55.456 --> 15:57.081
start nibbling

15:53.829 --> 15:57.081
at your eyeballs.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.523
(CHUCKLES)

16:00.524 --> 16:01.795
Vanilla Ice Museum it is.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.717
Hey, Austin.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.782
Whoa. Back off, Red.

16:08.783 --> 16:10.721
We're running out

16:06.842 --> 16:10.721
of guitars.

16:10.846 --> 16:11.889
No, no, no,

16:11.890 --> 16:12.931
I was just outside

16:10.846 --> 16:12.931
and got inspired

16:13.056 --> 16:14.683
- to write
- a brand new song.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.393
- It's called
- Granny in a Tube Top,

16:16.518 --> 16:17.787
- And it goes a little
- something like this.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.229
- (BEATBOXING)
- Jessie.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.498
- ♪ Granny in a tube top
- Listening to hip-hop... ♪

16:20.522 --> 16:22.357
- Jessie. Let me stop
- you right there.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.380
Quit worrying,

16:24.381 --> 16:26.277
your song about the imaginary

16:22.482 --> 16:26.277
friends is really great.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.197
Her what? About who?

16:30.281 --> 16:31.783
See you on stage.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.285
And just in case you

16:33.286 --> 16:34.661
feel like breaking

16:31.909 --> 16:34.661
something else,

16:34.786 --> 16:36.664
I've got the entire store's

16:36.665 --> 16:38.540
inventory up here.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.382
Okay, Zuri, look,

16:46.383 --> 16:47.883
I know this looks

16:44.880 --> 16:47.883
really bad,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.260
me, an adult,

16:50.261 --> 16:52.512
stealing a poem from you,

16:48.007 --> 16:52.512
an eight year old girl.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.826
Oh. It also

16:53.827 --> 16:55.014
sounds really bad.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.310
I'm so sorry, okay?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.042
If you want to

17:01.043 --> 17:02.647
smash something, go ahead.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.647
I've got a tab.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.525
No, it's okay.

17:05.526 --> 17:06.859
I'm cool.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.194
Wait, you're not mad?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.696
No. I know how much

17:10.698 --> 17:12.073
this means to you,

17:12.198 --> 17:13.471
so you can take

17:13.472 --> 17:14.742
credit for it.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.308
Zuri, oh.

17:16.309 --> 17:17.746
That is such an

17:14.867 --> 17:17.746
amazing gesture.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.079
Thank you.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.499
Besides, what else

17:20.500 --> 17:21.791
have you got in your life?

17:21.916 --> 17:24.337
Playwriting didn't work out,

17:24.338 --> 17:26.755
acting didn't work out,

17:21.916 --> 17:26.755
and you're dating a doorman.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.028
Ooh. Could've just

17:29.029 --> 17:31.175
stopped at the gesture.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.933
LUKE: Dez and Mrs. Kipling

17:37.934 --> 17:39.142
look really cool, surfing.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.498
RAVI: Meanwhile,

17:40.499 --> 17:41.728
even the manatees

17:39.267 --> 17:41.728
were laughing at me.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.710
Here's Dez and Kipling

17:44.711 --> 17:46.190
chillin' like Miami Vice.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.068
While they were having fun,

17:48.069 --> 17:49.820
that old lady was pinching

17:46.316 --> 17:49.820
off my cheek.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.489
And here's you

17:52.490 --> 17:53.615
dressed like a girl.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.846
Because they took

17:54.847 --> 17:55.951
the two best holes.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.351
I cannot bear to look

18:00.352 --> 18:02.123
at these pictures you took

17:58.578 --> 18:02.123
any longer.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.626
They prove Mrs. Kipling

18:03.627 --> 18:05.002
favors another.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.857
Dude, there's no way

18:06.858 --> 18:08.588
she'd choose Dez over you.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.089
- You hatched her
- from an egg.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.925
- You took care
- of her babies.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.551
- Trust me,
- she loves you.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.846
For realsies?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.890
For realsies.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.371
I heard everything,

18:20.372 --> 18:21.726
I'm so sorry.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.687
- I didn't mean to steal
- your best friend.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.522
Animals just love me.

18:25.523 --> 18:27.231
Isn't that right,

18:23.812 --> 18:27.231
Senor Whiskers?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.756
Wait, how long have you

18:30.757 --> 18:32.070
had that rat?

18:32.195 --> 18:33.926
It's not a rat, it's a gerbil.

18:33.927 --> 18:35.657
And I got him in New York.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.222
You guys have got

18:37.223 --> 18:38.660
tons of these just

18:35.782 --> 18:38.660
roaming the streets.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.496
Oh, thank goodness.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.185
Mrs. Kipling was only after

18:43.186 --> 18:44.749
her favorite snack.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.294
She does not give

18:46.295 --> 18:47.711
one wet toot about you.

18:48.879 --> 18:51.089
(GASPS) Rude.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.591
I don't think

18:52.592 --> 18:53.967
our whole friendship is

18:51.214 --> 18:53.967
based off Senor Whiskers.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.218
(SCREAMS)

18:58.847 --> 19:00.077
Remember,

19:00.078 --> 19:01.307
no flash photography,

18:58.847 --> 19:01.307
and...

19:01.432 --> 19:03.956
And make sure to stay

19:03.957 --> 19:06.479
at least ten feet away

19:01.432 --> 19:06.479
from Austin at all times.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.565
Cute dress.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.400
Make that 20 feet.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.655
- Your sister's kind of
- weird about Austin.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.240
(SCOFFS) I'll say.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.555
She's been

19:18.556 --> 19:19.743
collecting his hair

19:17.365 --> 19:19.743
so she can clone him.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.224
He should really

19:21.225 --> 19:22.579
get more security.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.539
And a hairnet.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.396
And introducing,

19:27.397 --> 19:28.543
Austin Moon.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.753

19:42.766 --> 19:44.664
She's gonna be singing

19:44.665 --> 19:46.561

19:42.766 --> 19:46.561
and she wrote the lyrics.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.854
(CHEERING)

19:49.981 --> 19:51.254

19:51.255 --> 19:52.525

20:01.743 --> 20:03.286

- but a lot.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.168
I'm sorry.

20:09.169 --> 20:10.418
I know I should have

20:07.916 --> 20:10.418
told you earlier,

20:10.543 --> 20:12.170
- I just wanted this
- so much.

Wow. It takes
