00:00.725 --> 00:03.106
- Who is this?
- Another Olivia Dunham.

00:03.201 --> 00:04.569
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:04.664 --> 00:06.040
They've done experiments on me.

00:06.329 --> 00:08.489
Agent Dunham escaped
from Liberty Island.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.041
Olivia is in trouble.
I'm not sitting here.

00:10.145 --> 00:11.832
Hey, Liv!
Thank God we found you.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.217
I'm not who you think I am.

00:13.914 --> 00:14.481
Mom?

00:14.649 --> 00:15.625
I'm not your daughter.

00:15.738 --> 00:17.978
My mother died when I
was fourteen years old.

00:18.234 --> 00:19.151
You are, you're just confused!

00:19.219 --> 00:20.635
This was going to be
my way home.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.354
- This is your home.
- I've never been here before!

00:22.422 --> 00:25.024
If you've never been here,
how did you know to come here?

00:26.459 --> 00:28.294
Why convince her
she's our Olivia Dunham?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.179
You'll know soon enough.

Ah! Ugh!

02:26.896 --> 02:28.530
Oh, my gosh!

02:28.598 --> 02:31.366

03:43.156 --> 03:46.492
Welcome back, Agent Dunham.

03:48.578 --> 03:50.295
You do remember me, right?

03:50.380 --> 03:53.882
Yeah.

03:53.950 --> 03:55.884
You're that tightwad
that owes me $70.

03:55.952 --> 03:57.085
Damn it!

03:57.136 --> 03:58.637
I was... I was hoping
you'd forget about that.

03:58.721 --> 04:00.121
It's good to see you.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.590
You too.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.891
No worse for the wear...

04:02.959 --> 04:04.510
You look like
you got some rest.

04:04.594 --> 04:05.811
A continuous I.V. drip

04:05.895 --> 04:07.513
and government-issue
antipsychotics,

04:07.597 --> 04:09.681
- it's like instant R&R.
- It sounds like fun.

04:09.766 --> 04:11.567
Maybe I should, uh,
dive off the deep end.

04:11.634 --> 04:14.403
Hey, you think anyone
would notice a difference?

04:14.470 --> 04:16.772
You know what
I realized this minute?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.273
That I didn't miss you at all,

04:18.324 --> 04:20.325
not even an itty, little bit.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.777
Come on, you were lost
without me.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.245
- Admit it.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.761
How does she seem?

04:39.829 --> 04:43.482
She seems like Olivia Dunham.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.268
For all intents and purposes,
she is Agent Dunham.

04:46.336 --> 04:50.505
She's internalized her traits,
her memories, her knowledge.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.341
When tested,
she consistently responds

04:53.393 --> 04:57.446
as our Agent Dunham would
under similar circumstances.

04:57.513 --> 04:59.314
And what about
our Agent Dunham?

04:59.365 --> 05:01.783
Has she made contact?

05:01.851 --> 05:05.537
She is on the other side...

05:05.622 --> 05:08.040
focused on the task at hand.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.047
Permission to speak,
Mr. Secretary.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.303
Go ahead.

05:23.306 --> 05:26.258
Putting an impostor
on my team is too big a risk.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.260
Now, you can run
all the tests you want,

05:28.344 --> 05:30.879
but you don't know how this
Olivia will respond in the field.

05:30.947 --> 05:32.331
We have no other choice.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.684
She needs to be completely
immersed in Agent Dunham's life.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.353
Over time,
she will reach a plateau,

05:38.404 --> 05:41.823
- and her new identity will become fixed.
- Well, how much time?

05:41.891 --> 05:43.909
Because I'm not willing to lose
one of my legitimate agents.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.360
You don't know
what we have to gain.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.695
Which is what, exactly?

05:49.248 --> 05:50.415
Sit down.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.793
She can move between worlds.

06:01.878 --> 06:05.413
We have discovered
some ways to cross over.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.116
But each comes with their
own dangerous consequences.

06:08.184 --> 06:10.519
But she...

06:10.586 --> 06:12.253
She can cross without harm.

06:14.691 --> 06:17.409
The Science Division is working up
a series of experiments.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.612
We need her
to submit willingly,

06:20.697 --> 06:23.765
which she'll only do if she
believes that she belongs here.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.601
Phillip...

06:26.669 --> 06:29.121
If we can learn
what she already knows...

06:29.205 --> 06:32.107
We can begin
to defend ourselves.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.950
And what if her
new identity doesn't hold?

06:42.001 --> 06:44.670
Then she'll
no longer be necessary.

06:46.956 --> 06:51.143
- Keep me apprised.
- Yes, sir.

06:57.074 --> 07:00.901
Yesterday a Liberty Metro bus
ran a red light, killing a person.

07:00.952 --> 07:03.370
This morning same thing
happened again.

07:03.437 --> 07:06.073
Two mornings in a row,
two buses kill two people.

07:06.124 --> 07:08.709
Now, lookers
ran the probabilities,

07:08.776 --> 07:10.077
and it's a statistical anomaly.

07:10.128 --> 07:11.795
What happened
at yesterday's crash?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.580
Police considered it
a routine accident,

07:13.631 --> 07:15.048
so we have
no more information.

07:15.116 --> 07:17.951
- You mind taking over?
- Sure.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.219
Okay...

07:19.287 --> 07:21.505
The first victim's name
is Cole Arnett,

07:21.589 --> 07:22.622
43 years old.

07:22.674 --> 07:24.141
He was on his way
to his job.

07:24.225 --> 07:25.826
He is a hospital case worker.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.394
Must've been his unlucky day.

07:27.445 --> 07:28.579
All right, we're coming in.

07:28.663 --> 07:30.497
Oxygen, people.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.168
Air quality normal,
no oxygen needed.

07:34.235 --> 07:36.069
Okay, listen up.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.588
Agent Lee will be
meeting us on the site.

07:37.672 --> 07:38.922
He'll be calling the shots.

07:50.955 --> 07:53.090
Agent Francis.

07:56.608 --> 07:58.108
Watch the time, Agent Lee.

07:58.193 --> 08:00.277
I need you back in that chamber
in eight hours,

08:00.361 --> 08:01.778
or your burns will regress.

08:01.863 --> 08:04.081
- You can kiss all that healing good-bye.
- Easy come, easy go.

08:04.165 --> 08:06.872
- Oh, you think you're amusing.
- I am amusing!

08:07.753 --> 08:09.836
- God, I miss this.
- I bet.

08:09.904 --> 08:11.622
Did, uh, Broyles
download you yet?

08:11.706 --> 08:13.373
Talked to him on the way over.

08:13.424 --> 08:14.708
I need a victim I.D.

08:14.759 --> 08:17.410
See what I can do.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.798
- Where's my...
- Field kit?

08:21.883 --> 08:22.916
Here.

08:26.921 --> 08:27.888
You look better.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.223
You look sane.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.759
- You doing all right?
- So far.

08:32.809 --> 08:35.111
I mean, it's
my first day back, so...

08:37.115 --> 08:39.198
Listen, when I pulled
that gun on you,

08:39.267 --> 08:40.433
I didn't know what I was doing.

08:40.485 --> 08:43.570
- If something had happened...
- But nothing happened.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.405
You and I, we're good.

08:45.456 --> 08:46.790
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:48.943 --> 08:50.077
Died on impact.

08:50.128 --> 08:51.828
No attempts
to revive her were made.

08:51.913 --> 08:53.630
Obviously.

08:53.715 --> 08:55.415
Still have any fingerprints?

08:55.466 --> 08:57.134
Right hand's
probably your best bet.

08:59.387 --> 09:02.673
Real name's Jillian Foster, 32.
Lives right here in Hoboken.

09:02.757 --> 09:04.224
Anything else?

09:04.292 --> 09:06.783
She liked daisies.

09:06.807 --> 09:10.297
I never hit
a person before, never.

09:10.348 --> 09:11.982
I mean, once, I hit a pigeon.

09:12.066 --> 09:18.638
I felt horrible for weeks.

09:20.408 --> 09:23.143
No sign
of environmental degradation.

09:23.194 --> 09:26.046
Molecular cohesion is intact.

09:26.114 --> 09:29.116
So why is this a Fringe case?

09:40.428 --> 09:44.831
Yeah, yeah.
We're done. Thanks.

09:44.882 --> 09:47.184
What, you got something?

09:47.268 --> 09:48.835
When's the last time
you saw one of these?

09:48.886 --> 09:50.687
God, a pen?
I don't know.

09:50.772 --> 09:51.722
Pre-school maybe.

09:51.806 --> 09:53.140
I didn't know
they still made these.

09:53.191 --> 09:54.441
It's obviously new.

09:54.508 --> 09:56.509
- No dents, no scratches.
- Where'd you find it?

09:56.561 --> 09:57.811
Right there, by the mailbox.

09:57.862 --> 09:59.813
Oh, that's where the
bike messenger said he swerved,

09:59.881 --> 10:02.182
so he wouldn't hit some old guy
that was bending down.

10:02.233 --> 10:05.118
Huh.

10:07.705 --> 10:09.406
Uh, you want to share, buddy?

10:09.490 --> 10:11.491
Or are we supposed to stand here
and watch you think?

10:11.542 --> 10:14.194
All right...

10:14.245 --> 10:16.580
It's pretty rare finding one
of these just lying around.

10:16.664 --> 10:19.032
Well, maybe the old guy
bent down to pick it up,

10:19.083 --> 10:20.917
and that's what caused
the bike messenger to swerve.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.052
Causing him to hit the stand.

10:22.136 --> 10:25.538
Like the pen
started some kind of...

10:25.590 --> 10:26.706
chain reaction.

10:37.018 --> 10:38.218
Did you find something?

10:38.269 --> 10:39.486
What is it?

10:43.441 --> 10:44.991
Sorry, I thought
I recognized someone.

10:45.059 --> 10:46.599
You okay?

10:47.304 --> 10:48.995
Yeah.

10:49.063 --> 10:52.499
All right, so...

10:52.566 --> 10:54.451
Fringe event...

10:54.535 --> 10:55.702
or not?

10:55.753 --> 10:57.904
Not sure yet.

10:57.955 --> 11:00.207
But something weird
definitely happened here.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.244
Yeah.

11:17.758 --> 11:19.810
Hello?

11:19.894 --> 11:22.779
Hey, babe.

11:22.864 --> 11:24.531
You didn't have to do that.

11:24.598 --> 11:26.566
Well...
Hey.

11:26.617 --> 11:29.202
Thank you.

11:30.538 --> 11:32.322
So how was it?

11:32.407 --> 11:34.825
Yeah, it was...
It was pretty good.

11:34.909 --> 11:35.959
Yeah?

11:36.043 --> 11:37.127
What's happening
in north Texas?

11:37.211 --> 11:38.378
I heard it's
a pretty bad outbreak.

11:38.446 --> 11:39.963
22 smallpox cases so far.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.131
Has Atlanta called?

11:41.215 --> 11:42.782
No, no one's assigned me yet.

11:42.834 --> 11:43.834
Oh.

11:43.918 --> 11:45.785
Wait, why are
we talking about this?

11:45.837 --> 11:47.003
Because you're a virologist,

11:47.088 --> 11:49.456
and smallpox is one
of your areas of expertise.

11:49.507 --> 11:50.974
You may as well start packing.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.392
No, I mean,
why are we talking about me?

11:52.460 --> 11:54.344
I want to talk about you.
How was it being back at work?

11:58.649 --> 12:00.901
What's wrong?

12:00.968 --> 12:03.136
Did something happen?

12:04.638 --> 12:06.106
Well, at first, it was normal.

12:06.157 --> 12:08.692
And then we're out
in the field, and... And...

12:10.428 --> 12:11.445
I saw a face.

12:11.496 --> 12:12.812
- A face?
- Mm.

12:12.864 --> 12:13.997
Was it someone you know?

12:14.065 --> 12:16.867
Do you remember
the Secretary's son...

12:16.951 --> 12:19.836
The one who was kidnapped
when he was a boy?

12:19.921 --> 12:21.588
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, him.

12:21.655 --> 12:22.822
But it wasn't really him.

12:22.874 --> 12:26.593
It was... It was like I was
hallucinating or something.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.844
- Did you tell Broyles?
- No.

12:27.929 --> 12:30.180
Maybe you shouldn't be
on field duty.

12:31.349 --> 12:33.600
Yeah, I want to be there.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.668
I know, but you
have to tell someone...

12:35.720 --> 12:36.937
A doctor, at least.

12:37.004 --> 12:38.338
I need my life back, Frank.

12:38.389 --> 12:39.839
And I love
your gung-ho attitude,

12:39.891 --> 12:42.726
but, honey, you just got
over a breakdown.

12:42.810 --> 12:44.861
If you need help, that's fine.

12:44.946 --> 12:46.780
Frank, it was
my first day back.

12:46.847 --> 12:47.981
I was nervous.

12:48.032 --> 12:49.849
I don't think
that it's that surprising

12:49.901 --> 12:52.369
- that there's a trace...
- I can take myself off call.

12:52.453 --> 12:55.572
- Maybe it's not a good time to travel.
- That's not what I want.

13:00.578 --> 13:01.745
Are those avocados?

13:01.829 --> 13:04.664
Where did you get them?

13:06.934 --> 13:08.902
- How much?
- Don't worry about that.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.554
- Liv, what if it happens again?
- It won't.

13:10.638 --> 13:12.389
But if it does,
you'll tell Broyles, right?

13:12.473 --> 13:15.141
Because...
I love you.

13:20.565 --> 13:22.282
I'll tell him.

13:22.350 --> 13:23.984
Thank you.

13:24.051 --> 13:26.319
- Can we eat?
- Yes, we can eat.

13:26.387 --> 13:27.521
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:37.389 --> 13:39.045
All right.
Help me out here.

13:39.059 --> 13:41.027
So the first bus driver
was distracted by tree trimmers

13:41.094 --> 13:42.528
when he ran the red light.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.814
The second bus driver was
looking at a fight over oranges.

13:44.898 --> 13:48.534
Isn't distraction
the root of every accident?

13:48.602 --> 13:50.653
Listen, I'm not
finding any connections

13:50.738 --> 13:51.988
in these victims' bios either.

13:52.072 --> 13:53.323
The first guy, Arnett,

13:53.407 --> 13:56.042
worked at a hospital
for the past fifteen years.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.244
The second victim, Ms. Foster,
landed her position

13:58.312 --> 14:00.112
at Gregston Electric
a little over a year ago.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.331
Maybe they knew
someone in common?

14:01.415 --> 14:03.249
Or maybe,
despite what Farnsworth said,

14:03.300 --> 14:04.917
it's just...

14:04.969 --> 14:06.419
two freak accidents.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.920
You know,
Liv thinks I'm right...

14:07.972 --> 14:11.257
about there being chain reactions
that led up to the crashes.

14:11.325 --> 14:13.309
Okay.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.428
Well, now that you two have,
uh, rediscovered

14:15.479 --> 14:18.598
your Vulcan mind meld...

14:18.649 --> 14:19.932
Do you think she's doing okay?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.401
Yeah.

14:21.468 --> 14:22.735
Why, you don't think so?

14:22.803 --> 14:23.987
I don't know.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.971
I just... I just feel
a little uncomfortable.

14:26.023 --> 14:27.306
That's not a shocker.

14:27.358 --> 14:29.475
You let a doppelganger
coldcock you with a bottle

14:29.526 --> 14:30.827
because you didn't pick up
on the fact

14:30.911 --> 14:32.862
- that she wasn't your partner.
- And you would have?

14:32.946 --> 14:34.330
I just know Liv
a little better, that's all.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.948
Right.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.918
'cause you...
You kissed her one time.

14:38.985 --> 14:40.370
How was I supposed to know
she had a boyfriend?

14:40.454 --> 14:42.321
- Okay.
- Whatever.

14:42.373 --> 14:44.173
The point is, I would've known.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.876
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that, okay?

14:46.960 --> 14:49.128
When she was having
her breakdown,

14:49.179 --> 14:51.764
she kept on and on
about how they were trying

14:51.832 --> 14:53.383
to make her believe
she was somebody else,

14:53.467 --> 14:56.052
that this wasn't her life.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.856
This is gonna sound nuts.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.340
What if she's telling
the truth?

15:01.392 --> 15:04.477
What if it's not the real her?

15:09.149 --> 15:10.466
That is nuts.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.851
You're right.
All right.

15:11.902 --> 15:14.954
For the record, you cannot tell
those two apart.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.690
Look at this...

15:17.741 --> 15:18.991
Over there on the ground,

15:19.043 --> 15:20.543
the lower corner.

15:22.696 --> 15:24.047
That's another ballpoint pen.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.748
Get Liv, tell her
we got something.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.700
Someone is causing
these accidents on purpose.

15:27.751 --> 15:29.052
How is that even possible?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.703
I mean, what would be the odds?

15:30.771 --> 15:34.373
0.000...
Impossible.

15:34.425 --> 15:36.092
Astrid, we see
impossible every day.

15:36.176 --> 15:37.543
You see improbable.

15:37.594 --> 15:39.395
You're asking me
if it is possible for a person

15:39.480 --> 15:41.898
to use a ballpoint pen
to set off a chain of events

15:41.982 --> 15:44.901
that culminates in someone
getting killed by a bus twice?

15:44.985 --> 15:45.985
Exactly.

15:46.052 --> 15:47.487
There's no way.

15:47.554 --> 15:49.405
Yeah, but given how few
ballpoint pens are out there,

15:49.490 --> 15:51.441
finding one
at both crime scenes...

15:51.525 --> 15:53.910
I mean, that's an anomaly.
You said that yourself.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.562
- What if someone calculated the variables?
- 37 people in the intersection,

15:56.613 --> 15:58.748
22 cars, 4 trucks, 2 buses,

15:58.832 --> 16:01.918
Wind speeds of five to ten miles an hour,
and that is just to start.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.836
In total, we are talking
about 120 variables

16:03.904 --> 16:05.755
in a dynamic system
of differential equations.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.673
I can't solve
that kind of a problem,

16:07.741 --> 16:09.592
much less manipulate
the outcome to my advantage.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.911
So there's not even the slightest chance
we're dealing with a murderer?

16:11.962 --> 16:13.412
Dude, seriously?

16:13.464 --> 16:16.432
What part of 0.000
don't you get?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.301
What is it?

16:18.385 --> 16:20.586
It happened again.

16:20.637 --> 16:22.638
What did?

16:22.723 --> 16:25.057
Bus accident,
East 85th and York.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.660
- Have you called the ambulance?
- It's on the way.

16:44.745 --> 16:46.996
Sir, we're gonna get you
to the hospital.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.418
Where were you sitting
on the bus?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.953
Right in the front, first seat.

16:54.004 --> 16:56.472
- Did you happen to notice a pen?
- What?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.175
A... A pen.
A... A ballpoint pen.

16:59.259 --> 17:01.310
You use it to...

17:01.395 --> 17:03.262
to write with.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.815
Looks like there was
some sort of commotion.

17:05.898 --> 17:08.351
Dog ran into the street,
distracted a bus driver.

17:08.435 --> 17:10.252
There is no way this
is another coincidence.

17:10.337 --> 17:11.587
Except this time
it didn't work.

17:11.672 --> 17:12.755
He's gonna make it.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.423
Uh, ma'am,

17:14.508 --> 17:16.041
you need to stay still.

17:23.467 --> 17:24.550
It's not over.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.268
He's still here!

17:53.597 --> 17:54.881
Stop!

17:54.932 --> 17:56.415
Don't move!

17:56.466 --> 17:58.601
Take your hands
out of your pockets.

18:07.611 --> 18:09.261
Put your hands on your head.

18:19.439 --> 18:20.957
Whoa!

18:37.977 --> 18:39.689
Give Astrid his physical description.

18:39.757 --> 18:41.157
Have her run it through
the database.

18:41.242 --> 18:43.777
I did. She's already working on it.

18:43.828 --> 18:45.578
- Okay.
- You got to get back in that pod.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.080
It's just
the two-minute warning.

18:47.147 --> 18:48.915
Agent Lee, what part

18:48.982 --> 18:50.834
of be "back in eight hours"
didn't you understand?

18:50.918 --> 18:53.286
You know, I... I still
can't believe that he knew

18:53.337 --> 18:55.004
the bike would cause
the truck to slow down

18:55.089 --> 18:56.373
and swerve
under the footbridge.

18:56.457 --> 18:57.590
I mean, he didn't even look.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.158
How did he know
precisely when to jump?

18:59.210 --> 19:01.928
You should stop focusing on how
and focus on why.

19:01.995 --> 19:03.630
Why is he targeting
these people?

19:03.681 --> 19:04.764
All right, I'm working on it.

19:04.832 --> 19:06.466
The victims must have
something in common.

19:06.517 --> 19:08.301
There's got to be
a connection we're not seeing.

19:08.352 --> 19:09.853
Oh, God.

19:09.937 --> 19:11.471
Okay, Lincoln,
you got to get in there.

19:11.522 --> 19:13.189
Cross-check
their medical files,

19:13.274 --> 19:15.642
criminal records, job histories,
tax histories...

19:15.693 --> 19:17.811
- Shut up, okay? I got it.
- Someone's gotten bossy.

19:31.158 --> 19:32.125
Where have you been?

19:32.192 --> 19:33.359
They've been calling all day.

19:33.411 --> 19:34.661
What did you tell them?

19:34.712 --> 19:36.529
Nothing.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.197
You have to call them back.

19:38.249 --> 19:40.366
Each liquefied thing
provides an instance

19:40.418 --> 19:41.668
of the property of being liquid.

19:41.719 --> 19:42.752
Liquid and mass is equal.

19:42.837 --> 19:44.871
Passing through liquid
and mass is the same.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.423
If you don't call them, I will.

19:46.507 --> 19:48.391
But you won't.

19:48.476 --> 19:52.095
You see, your only action
will be inaction.

19:52.179 --> 19:53.563
That's your pattern.

19:53.647 --> 19:55.515
What?

19:55.566 --> 19:59.402
97% of your actions prioritize
relational bonds over other variables.

19:59.487 --> 20:01.237
Eight out of nine times,
you avoid making decisions

20:01.322 --> 20:03.055
that could result
in a negative outcome.

20:05.326 --> 20:08.445
I am not some collection of data
you need to make sense of.

20:08.529 --> 20:10.530
I'm your sister.

20:10.581 --> 20:13.032
I'm worried about you.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.451
Can't you see that?

20:14.535 --> 20:17.670
- All I want is for you to...
- Is for you to be safe.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.756
That's all I've
ever wanted for you.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.508
- Go again.
- Stop finishing my sentences,

20:21.575 --> 20:22.709
and let me help you.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.377
Trust me, Milo, I've always
been there for you.

20:24.428 --> 20:26.546
I've always taken care of you.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.431
That was fun.

20:34.271 --> 20:36.806
Don't.
I...

20:36.891 --> 20:37.974
Don't.
Don't.

20:38.058 --> 20:39.425
You didn't expect that,
did you?

20:39.477 --> 20:43.029
Because you've forgotten
what it's like to feel emotions.

20:43.096 --> 20:44.931
No, no.

20:44.982 --> 20:47.099
You've forgotten us.

20:47.151 --> 20:49.152
Mom gave you this
as a reminder...

20:49.236 --> 20:50.453
No.

20:50.538 --> 20:53.873
That you didn't have to do
more than you were able to,

20:53.924 --> 20:56.092
that we loved you.

20:59.847 --> 21:02.098
- That's irrelevant now.
- Milo, please!

21:02.183 --> 21:04.684
I don't recognize you anymore.

21:04.735 --> 21:07.437
I made a mistake
when I signed you up.

21:07.521 --> 21:09.889
I didn't mean this.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.892
You have to follow the rules.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.729
You have to do what they say.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.948
You're overreaching.

21:25.756 --> 21:27.709
Remember this.

21:43.152 --> 21:44.244
Look, listen.

21:44.267 --> 21:47.457
What time is your mommy
gonna be home?

21:47.541 --> 21:48.841
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:48.909 --> 21:50.376
I don't want to hear you
play your flute, kid.

21:50.427 --> 21:52.128
I'm gonna call you back.

21:52.212 --> 21:53.796
You just hung up on a child.

21:53.881 --> 21:55.598
You talk to the next witness.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.249
I hope it's
a tuba player, okay?

21:57.301 --> 21:58.684
Fine.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.437
Uh, this is Agent Dunham,

22:01.522 --> 22:04.223
can you connect me
to the next witness, please?

22:04.274 --> 22:06.059
Excuse me?

22:09.980 --> 22:11.364
- Hey, Charlie...
- Yeah?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.698
Since when do we need a code?

22:12.766 --> 22:14.200
They upgraded
the system last month.

22:14.268 --> 22:15.785
You don't remember?

22:15.869 --> 22:17.703
Sorry.

22:17.771 --> 22:21.440
I guess I'm still getting
over the head trauma.

22:26.613 --> 22:30.249
- Hey, Liv.
- Yeah?

22:30.300 --> 22:33.169
You remember that time
when we were in Coney Island?

22:33.253 --> 22:36.005
We were riding
the Hellhole together, right?

22:36.090 --> 22:38.791
You got sick, and you threw up
on the guy next to you.

22:43.397 --> 22:45.815
Yeah...

22:45.883 --> 22:48.985
Except <i>you</i> threw up all over
the person next to you,

22:49.069 --> 22:51.303
so you can stop trying
to rewrite history.

22:52.973 --> 22:55.525
What... What made
you think of that?

22:55.609 --> 22:58.694
- Witness is from Coney.
- Oh.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.396
Hey, wait a sec...

23:00.464 --> 23:03.416
Jillian Foster was a consultant
for Gregston Electric.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.501
I don't see the connection.

23:05.586 --> 23:08.287
- The first victim worked at Bryant Hospital, right?
- Yeah, Cole Arnett.

23:08.338 --> 23:10.423
They mainly deal
with neurological disorders,

23:10.490 --> 23:12.458
Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, PTSD...

23:12.509 --> 23:13.843
Top-flight medical research.

23:13.927 --> 23:15.795
Okay, it says here
that Gregston Electric

23:15.846 --> 23:18.497
owns a subsidiary company
called the Ivon Medical Group.

23:18.549 --> 23:20.216
The Ivon Medical Group
is also listed

23:20.300 --> 23:22.885
as one of Bryant Hospital's
outside vendors.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.353
You're driving.

23:24.438 --> 23:27.557
As hospitals go, not bad.

23:27.641 --> 23:29.642
Yeah, unless it's run
by an evil genius

23:29.693 --> 23:31.694
who's creating accidents
to kill people.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.396
- Good morning.
- Welcome to Bryant.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.947
What can I do for you?

23:35.015 --> 23:36.348
Agent Francis, Agent Dunham.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.618
We're here to see
your chief medical director.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.785
Hold on, I'll let him know.

23:39.853 --> 23:44.624
Hi, Violet. Could you let Dr. Levin
know Fringe agents are here?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.459
It'll just be a minute.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.411
Are we being quarantined?

23:48.495 --> 23:49.662
No.
Scout's honor.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.544
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

24:05.596 --> 24:08.714
Right there on the table.

24:08.765 --> 24:10.433
We're definitely in the right place.

24:11.332 --> 24:14.237
So sorry for the delay.
I'm Dr. Levin.

24:14.321 --> 24:16.489
Agent Francis.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.940
Uh, Agent Dunham.

24:18.025 --> 24:20.243
Hi. Please,
my office is right this way.

24:20.327 --> 24:22.394
Doctor, we just noticed

24:22.446 --> 24:25.064
that a lot of your patients
are using ballpoint pens.

24:25.115 --> 24:28.234
Well, many of our residents
have trouble interfacing digitally

24:28.285 --> 24:29.835
due to their
mental deficiencies.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.370
Pen and paper is just a...

24:31.421 --> 24:33.089
Well, an easier way
to communicate.

24:33.173 --> 24:35.841
Did you know
Mr. Arnett well?

24:35.909 --> 24:38.044
We didn't socialize
outside of work,

24:38.095 --> 24:41.180
but, uh, well, we were
all devastated when we heard.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.519
- What about this woman?
- Yes, Jillian Foster.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.105
She, uh, worked
with the Ivon Medical Group.

24:49.189 --> 24:51.641
They were, uh, conducting
a drug trial here.

24:57.231 --> 24:58.430
You're kidding me.

25:01.434 --> 25:02.535
Jeffrey Mayer?

25:02.603 --> 25:04.036
You know him?

25:04.104 --> 25:05.371
Yes.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.790
But I, uh...
I don't understand.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.992
He was killed too?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.879
Doctor, we're gonna have
to question all your science

25:13.947 --> 25:15.715
and medical personnel on staff.

25:15.782 --> 25:19.135
You're not looking
for a doctor.

25:19.219 --> 25:21.837
You're looking for a patient.

25:21.922 --> 25:23.839
We started
this study a year ago.

25:23.924 --> 25:26.292
We were working
on creating nootropics.

25:26.343 --> 25:28.227
- Like smart drugs.
- That's right.

25:28.295 --> 25:32.515
All of our test subjects started
with an I.Q. of less than 65.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.817
Our aim was to increase
their intelligence.

25:34.885 --> 25:37.136
So they could function
independently

25:37.187 --> 25:39.155
- day to day.
- That's a worthy goal.

25:39.239 --> 25:40.639
We thought so too.

25:40.691 --> 25:42.808
Oh, st...
Ca... Can you go back?

25:45.412 --> 25:48.197
Stop.
That's him.

25:48.282 --> 25:49.481
Milo Stanfield.

25:49.533 --> 25:51.117
You don't sound surprised.

25:51.168 --> 25:53.586
I'm not.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.755
This was Milo
five months ago...

25:55.822 --> 25:58.224
Measured I.Q. of 56,

25:58.292 --> 26:00.960
severe cognitive deficiency.

26:05.299 --> 26:08.217
He's reciting the digits of pi.

26:08.285 --> 26:10.136
To 1,000 decimal places,

26:10.187 --> 26:12.471
while solving differential
equations in his head.

26:12.522 --> 26:13.606
That is unbelievable.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.642
That was after one treatment.

26:16.693 --> 26:18.010
We gave him five.

26:18.061 --> 26:20.780
Every time we administered
the protocol,

26:20.847 --> 26:23.916
his intelligence
increased exponentially.

26:23.984 --> 26:27.320
The final phase of the project
allows subjects to be released

26:27.371 --> 26:29.405
under the supervision
of a guardian's care.

26:29.489 --> 26:30.706
And after that?

26:30.791 --> 26:35.044
After that, we return the subjects
to their original state.

26:35.128 --> 26:37.129
A necessary part
of human drug trials.

26:37.197 --> 26:39.248
We had to determine

26:39.333 --> 26:41.217
whether the are any permanent
adverse side effects.

26:41.284 --> 26:44.253
So Milo didn't want
to be regressed,

26:44.338 --> 26:45.871
which is why he went
after Cole Arnett.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.473
We thought it was an accident.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.593
I drove to Ivon
and informed Jillian myself.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.596
She was concerned that the delay
in regressing Milo

26:53.680 --> 26:55.431
might compromise the results.

26:55.515 --> 26:57.066
She offered
to handle it herself.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.434
So Milo killed her too.

26:58.518 --> 27:00.353
So what about the third victim?

27:00.404 --> 27:03.272
- Jeffrey Mayer?
- A recovery specialist,

27:03.357 --> 27:06.275
who we contract with
if somebody goes missing.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.911
The thing is...

27:08.979 --> 27:12.031
I only put
the order in yesterday.

27:12.082 --> 27:15.785
Mr. Mayer had not yet
been assigned the task.

27:17.104 --> 27:19.088
Okay, so who's Milo's guardian?

27:19.172 --> 27:20.906
Uh, his sister.

27:20.957 --> 27:22.291
She lives out on Long Island...

27:22.376 --> 27:24.149
Oyster Bay, I believe.

27:24.172 --> 27:25.828
You really think
he'd go back there?

27:25.851 --> 27:27.648
He's got to know that's the
first place people are gonna look.

27:27.671 --> 27:30.442
I've been to Oyster Bay.
I never saw an oyster.

27:30.466 --> 27:32.802
I can't wait to tell
Lincoln he was right,

27:32.886 --> 27:34.420
that this guy is
actually able to start

27:34.471 --> 27:35.971
a chain reaction
to commit murder.

27:36.056 --> 27:37.606
I'm not watching
the happy dance.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.557
- Can I help you?
- Fringe Division.

28:23.581 --> 28:25.835
We need to ask you
a few questions.

28:25.858 --> 28:28.911
- Uh, about?
- About your brother, Milo.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.735
Three people?

28:33.747 --> 28:36.371
That we know of, yeah.

28:36.394 --> 28:37.732
No, there must be some mistake.

28:37.744 --> 28:39.351
Milo wouldn't kill
innocent people.

28:39.374 --> 28:41.445
I suppose he didn't think
they were that innocent.

28:41.456 --> 28:43.288
You know, after all,
they were trying

28:43.300 --> 28:45.413
to cut off the medication
that was making him smart.

28:46.294 --> 28:47.809
Right?

28:50.177 --> 28:51.539
Do you have any idea
where he is now?

28:51.551 --> 28:53.139
He doesn't confide
in me anymore.

28:55.602 --> 28:57.727
You mind if I take
a look at his room?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.260
Go ahead...
Last door on the left.

29:11.998 --> 29:13.576
Is that you?

29:14.499 --> 29:15.732
Mm-hmm.

29:17.938 --> 29:20.240
"Milo and Madeline"...

29:20.263 --> 29:22.130
Sounds like a kids' book.

29:22.154 --> 29:24.672
You're not the first
person to say that.

29:26.175 --> 29:28.457
Ah, you seem close.

29:29.169 --> 29:31.427
We were.

29:31.836 --> 29:33.718
He was a lot older, but...

29:33.742 --> 29:37.558
we liked the same cartoons,
played the same games.

29:37.581 --> 29:39.483
I had the opposite.

29:39.495 --> 29:42.081
My sister and I were close
in age, but...

29:42.093 --> 29:44.607
we fought over everything.

29:45.111 --> 29:47.610
Are you close now?

29:48.173 --> 29:51.831
Uh, she passed a few years ago.

29:52.223 --> 29:55.470
Oh, I'm sorry.
That must've been...

29:55.494 --> 29:57.866
- really difficult.
- It was.

30:03.152 --> 30:05.904
When I was little,
I used to always be scared

30:05.927 --> 30:07.566
that something
would happen to Milo.

30:07.589 --> 30:09.961
He'd forget to check
for cars,

30:09.985 --> 30:12.157
just run right into traffic.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.154
I worried that
he'd never be happy.

30:17.342 --> 30:19.456
He'd never feel like...

30:20.829 --> 30:22.695
Like he belonged.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.570
Must've been hard
watching him struggle.

30:31.428 --> 30:34.107
It was harder for him.

30:34.660 --> 30:37.143
That's why I agreed
to the drug study.

30:49.421 --> 30:52.957
He isn't that
helpless person anymore.

30:53.025 --> 30:56.460
He's dangerous,
and I think you know that.

30:56.512 --> 30:59.129
So if there is anything

30:59.181 --> 31:01.933
that you can think of...

31:01.984 --> 31:04.068
We just don't want to see
anyone else get hurt,

31:04.135 --> 31:06.370
including your brother.

31:26.535 --> 31:28.214
It's a...

31:29.224 --> 31:31.531
It's a good-bye note.

31:32.394 --> 31:34.132
But it says
where I can reach him.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.878
Thank you.

31:39.913 --> 31:41.613
Patricia Hotel,
Lakewood Avenue.

31:41.664 --> 31:42.831
Yeah, I'm gonna call backup,

31:42.916 --> 31:44.666
- get them to meet us there.
- Hold on a second.

31:44.751 --> 31:47.219
What if that's
what Milo wants?

31:47.286 --> 31:49.054
You know, that's his M.O.,
always ten steps ahead.

31:49.121 --> 31:51.140
So what, you think he knew that
his sister was gonna tell us?

31:51.224 --> 31:52.457
Listen, he knows
we're onto him.

31:52.509 --> 31:54.159
He knows his sister.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.928
What if he's trying
to set us up?

32:00.135 --> 32:03.003
Well, we can't just stand here.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.922
I can't answer that.

32:04.973 --> 32:06.173
<i>Why not?</i>

32:06.257 --> 32:07.558
Because there is no answer.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.259
It's a mathematical problem
without a solution.

32:09.311 --> 32:10.978
Well, which scenario
is more likely?

32:11.062 --> 32:12.680
We go to the Patricia hotel,
or we don't?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.431
Suppose he predicts
you'll go there.

32:14.482 --> 32:16.600
But then you'll predict
he'll predict that,

32:16.651 --> 32:17.985
- so you don't go.
- So we shouldn't go?

32:18.069 --> 32:19.570
But then he predicts
that you predicted that.

32:19.637 --> 32:20.821
<i>And he changes his plan,</i>

32:20.905 --> 32:22.239
<i>which means that you
should go to the hotel.</i>

32:22.306 --> 32:23.857
But then he predicts
that you'll predict

32:23.942 --> 32:25.976
what he predicted too.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.411
It's an infinite spiral.

32:27.478 --> 32:28.862
Okay, well, thank you, Astrid.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.863
We'll take it from here.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.701
- Where you going?
- To the Patricia Hotel.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.203
- Liv...
- Look, Charlie, he could be there now.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.752
I'm not willing to lose him.
Are you?

32:37.776 --> 32:39.208
Fine.
You drive.

34:02.432 --> 34:04.685
Charlie, there he is.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.603
Oh, that wasn't supposed
to happen.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.448
Freeze!

36:03.405 --> 36:04.438
Here.
Take it.

36:04.489 --> 36:07.458
Take it.
Press the button.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.077
You move again...

36:10.128 --> 36:12.079
The next one won't be
in your leg, buddy.

36:15.634 --> 36:17.451
That's it.

36:17.502 --> 36:18.752
You're okay.

36:18.803 --> 36:20.421
Just breathe.

36:27.229 --> 36:29.296
Since when
do you break protocol?

36:29.347 --> 36:31.632
You passed
by an auburn diamond, okay?

36:31.683 --> 36:34.268
Blinking auburn diamond,
which you ignored.

36:34.319 --> 36:37.605
- "Compromised air quality."
- Pressure's normal.

36:37.656 --> 36:40.074
- Thank you.
- Yep.

36:40.141 --> 36:41.909
You need oxygen to breathe.

36:41.976 --> 36:42.976
Charlie, I'm sorry.

36:43.028 --> 36:44.578
I don't really even know
why I did that.

36:44.646 --> 36:45.812
Because you're a daredevil.

36:45.864 --> 36:48.148
I get it.
So if you don't mind...

36:48.199 --> 36:50.584
I'd appreciate it if we don't go
through this again?

36:53.004 --> 36:54.838
Okay.

37:13.391 --> 37:15.776
The drugs have been
in his system too long,

37:15.843 --> 37:18.529
so the doctors weren't able
to reverse the effects.

37:20.848 --> 37:22.650
According to the doctors,

37:22.701 --> 37:27.788
the patterns that he sees are
too complex to put into words.

37:27.855 --> 37:32.359
His thoughts now can only
be interpreted by a machine.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.881
So... So the machine
is talking to him?

37:40.585 --> 37:43.938
Madeline, your brother...

37:44.005 --> 37:45.222
He no longer thinks

37:45.307 --> 37:49.376
in terms that you or I would
be able to comprehend.

37:54.432 --> 37:55.683
I'm sorry.

38:05.577 --> 38:09.997
...is equal value of six.
Six is the solution.

38:10.064 --> 38:12.700
What is a solution?
Derives a gradient of "Y."

38:12.751 --> 38:14.401
Evaluate a why for and proceed.

38:14.452 --> 38:17.388
Isolate discontinuities
and recalibrate.

38:25.580 --> 38:28.148
There's a 42% chance that
the king will take the queen.

39:03.203 --> 39:05.742
You know, sometimes
I envy you, Brandon...

39:05.754 --> 39:07.956
Being here,
nothing to distract you.

39:08.024 --> 39:11.693
Mr. Secretary, I didn't realize
you were coming.

39:14.702 --> 39:17.314
- These are my son's clothes.
- Yes.

39:17.399 --> 39:20.100
I thought if I used items
from the other side,

39:20.151 --> 39:22.419
it would provide
an associative link

39:22.487 --> 39:25.472
which would spark Olivia to...

39:25.523 --> 39:28.308
Cross over
to the other universe.

39:28.359 --> 39:31.078
Yes, good thinking.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.115
When will it be ready?

39:35.166 --> 39:36.667
We're very close.

39:36.751 --> 39:39.620
So far, all the test subjects

39:39.671 --> 39:40.838
I've hooked up to the chair...

39:40.922 --> 39:43.540
They're experiencing
a high level of anxiety,

39:43.625 --> 39:45.843
their stress is causing
my readings to fluctuate.

39:45.927 --> 39:48.462
I've been tinkering
with this thing all day.

39:48.513 --> 39:50.764
The solution is obvious...

39:50.832 --> 39:52.833
Submerge the subject in water.

39:52.884 --> 39:56.687
Sensory-deprivation tank.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.055
Of course.

39:58.139 --> 40:01.642
The womb-like atmosphere
naturally provides a state of relaxation.

40:01.709 --> 40:04.111
Sometimes simpler is better.

40:04.178 --> 40:06.363
Do you miss it?

40:06.448 --> 40:08.348
Miss what?

40:08.399 --> 40:10.884
Being a scientist.

40:10.952 --> 40:14.538
I am still
a scientist, Brandon.

40:14.622 --> 40:17.875
I just have
a much larger laboratory.

40:17.942 --> 40:21.044
Let me know as soon
as the tank's ready.

40:24.199 --> 40:25.716
God, I don't know
how you do it.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.085
I'm never done packing
till the cab actually arrives.

40:28.169 --> 40:30.254
Well, I'm off to deal
with diseased people

40:30.338 --> 40:32.589
in north Texas, so it's not like
I have to look good.

40:32.674 --> 40:34.758
Oh, except you do.

40:34.843 --> 40:36.310
Are you sure you're okay
with me doing this?

40:36.377 --> 40:38.228
I can still call Fiken,
beg him to cover for me.

40:38.313 --> 40:39.730
We have had this conversation.

40:39.814 --> 40:41.181
I know. I know.

40:41.232 --> 40:42.933
It's just they
haven't told me yet

40:43.017 --> 40:45.102
- how long I'll be gone.
- So just keep me posted.

40:46.654 --> 40:50.240
That's probably the cab.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.931
You know why you
didn't die today, right?

41:07.025 --> 41:09.626
Because you didn't know
the protocol.

41:09.694 --> 41:11.662
If you'd stopped for oxygen,

41:11.729 --> 41:13.363
you'd be dead right now.

41:16.267 --> 41:18.602
But you did something
that he couldn't factor in.

41:20.104 --> 41:22.072
You kept running.

41:23.875 --> 41:26.376
You know why you did that.

41:26.444 --> 41:30.414
It's the same reason you thought
you saw Walter in the hospital.

41:30.481 --> 41:33.367
It's the same reason why
you think you're seeing me now.

41:33.434 --> 41:35.919
You're not
from this world, Olivia.

41:37.805 --> 41:39.923
You're not her.

41:39.991 --> 41:42.309
You're not real.

41:45.146 --> 41:47.097
Real is just a matter
of perception.

41:49.651 --> 41:52.402
I am here.

41:52.487 --> 41:57.090
And I'm a part of you
that you have to hold onto.

41:57.158 --> 42:00.227
You can't forget
who you are, Olivia.

42:01.499 --> 42:04.898
You can't forget
where you're from.

42:08.444 --> 42:11.788
You can't forget this.

42:29.007 --> 42:31.024
What's wrong?

42:36.030 --> 42:38.615
Nothing. You just
surprised me, that's all.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.817
You all right?
