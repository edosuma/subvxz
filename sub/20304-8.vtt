NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:05.296
Can't you just lance it or something?

00:05.380 --> 00:08.758
I suppose I could try.
This might hurt a little.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.512
-Give me an order, Lieutenant.
-Kiss me, Nurse Wulfawitz.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.640
You're high, ain't you, Mizell?
Yeah, you're a using!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.642
-(panting)
-How'd you hurt your neck, LaRue?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.310
Banging your head against the wall
in your nowhere job...

00:19.394 --> 00:20.395
-(door slams)
-...in your nowhere precinct?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.605
[man] You heard about the fight
he had with LaRue?

00:23.773 --> 00:28.319
The only person further out in the cold
in the Mizell case than I am is Mizell.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.239
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:31.322 --> 00:34.200
-Ready? Aim, fire!
-(gunshot)

00:34.284 --> 00:36.411
I am going to bury you and your chief

00:36.494 --> 00:39.289
deeper than we just planted
that piece of dirt back there.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.333
Damn it, Frank,
you had Detweiler pegged from the get-go.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.419
-RENKO: Bobby!
-MAN: Hey, hey!

00:44.502 --> 00:47.213
-Don't worry, I only shot your good side.
-Renko!

00:47.297 --> 00:52.052
I long for kitchen detail
and the sound of little feet marching.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.053
What's the charge?

00:53.136 --> 00:56.431
Felony fraud, grand theft,
conspiracy to defraud.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.976
They even burglarize
the homes of police captains!

01:00.060 --> 01:00.977
Police captains?

01:09.694 --> 01:12.947
(chattering)

01:14.240 --> 01:15.700
ESTERHAUS: Item nine...

01:16.701 --> 01:19.037
Deedee, will you please check
on that bust for me?

01:19.704 --> 01:23.917
Item nine, a reminder
that we are presently embarking

01:24.000 --> 01:26.753
into the dark and perennially
turbulent waters

01:26.836 --> 01:28.922
-of the holiday shopping season...
-(groans)

01:29.005 --> 01:30.548
...with its intended oppressive effect,

01:30.632 --> 01:33.551
psychologically speaking,
on our median population.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.012
So in addition to the anticipated increase

01:36.096 --> 01:39.057
in your, uh, routine robberies,
batteries, assaults,

01:39.140 --> 01:40.850
and generally suicidal behaviors,

01:40.934 --> 01:44.395
let's be aware that shoppers also provide

01:44.479 --> 01:48.316
a particularly vulnerable target

01:48.399 --> 01:51.444
for scenarios with a more seasonal flavor.

01:51.528 --> 01:55.323
For instance, the ersatz
Salvation Army buckets...

01:55.406 --> 01:58.326
-(group murmuring)
-...or the snatching Santa.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.703
(laughter)

02:00.787 --> 02:03.039
Item ten, also, coincidentally,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.375
pertaining to matters of a holiday nature,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.211
the winner of our Thanksgiving
turkey raffle,

02:08.503 --> 02:12.465
courtesy of Wisniewski's Poultry,
is Andy Renko.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.509
(cheering)

02:17.303 --> 02:19.514
You can pick up your bird this afternoon.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.143
-I'd like to pick up your bird.
-(oohing)

02:23.226 --> 02:24.144
I heard that, Lucy.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.648
Item 11, the undercover operation
in Waverly Alley

02:28.898 --> 02:32.610
concerning fraudulent auto-related
personal-injury claims

02:32.861 --> 02:36.781
appears to be ripening
to a fruitful conclusion.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.451
Officer Belker--
excuse me, Detective Belker--

02:41.035 --> 02:44.664
aided by Detectives LaRue and Washington,
will stage a bipartisan raid

02:44.747 --> 02:48.835
in the middle part of the afternoon
to serve arrest and search warrants.

02:49.127 --> 02:54.007
Uniform officers assisting
will be our transfers from Midtown,

02:54.090 --> 02:56.676
Kolzicki and Nichols.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.094
(group murmuring)

02:58.178 --> 03:01.389
ESTERHAUS: Item 12, the last item, people.

03:02.348 --> 03:06.019
Requiem services
for Detective Stanley Mizell

03:06.102 --> 03:09.856
will be conducted this morning
at Veterans Memorial Park.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.567
Your attendance is requested,
but for the following,

03:12.650 --> 03:16.738
who will remain on call, Bates, Belker,
Coffey, Hingle, Ellis, LaRue,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.532
Tubbs, Washington, Nichols, and Kolzicki.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.326
It's a real shame we're gonna miss it.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.538
As regards dress for said occasion,

03:25.622 --> 03:29.459
uh, though formal wear is not compulsory,

03:30.043 --> 03:33.463
consider, if you will,
the appropriate dignity and respect

03:33.546 --> 03:36.466
to be afforded
the surviving members of the family.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.843
Which is a lot more than Stan ever did.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.180
An addendum to that...

03:44.349 --> 03:48.186
uh, Officer Schnitz informs me
that, uh, contributions to date

03:48.269 --> 03:53.316
to the Stan Mizell memorial fund
total a paltry $78.13.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.402
Setting aside for the moment
any and all subjective sentiments

03:56.486 --> 03:59.113
one may have held
with regards to the decedent,

03:59.197 --> 04:02.659
the particular issue in question here

04:03.159 --> 04:07.830
is the continued care for
and future education of

04:07.914 --> 04:11.125
a slain fellow officer's children!

04:12.877 --> 04:16.798
And I find the current level
of donations disappointing

04:16.881 --> 04:18.341
in the extremis.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.970
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.638
And let's be careful out there.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.604
-HILL: Oh! Oh! Would you watch it?
-Oh, Lord, Bobby.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.315
If you can't rotate your body
any faster than that,

04:34.565 --> 04:36.818
how are we supposed
to deal with any situation

04:36.901 --> 04:39.570
that might require our presence
above the mezzanine level?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.948
Oh, Renko, I've been shot,

04:42.031 --> 04:45.076
stabbed, beat up, kicked, left for dead,

04:45.159 --> 04:49.455
and I swear nothing,
nothing is as bad as this is yet.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.708
Look, just use this phone here
and call the doctor.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.044
-Do me a favor.
-Yeah, I gotta... I gotta call my doctor.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.463
-WASHINGTON: Yo, Leo.
-What was that number?

04:57.547 --> 05:00.550
-Where's that Mizell thing at?
-Right around the corner, Neal.

05:00.633 --> 05:05.430
-Five bucks for Mizell's kids.
-Perry, Perry. 555-4871.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.852
Uh, yeah.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.271
I'd like to make an appointment
with Dr. Perry.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.857
-Hey, Bobby, you all right, man?
-All right?

05:16.441 --> 05:19.819
This poor man has an eruption
on his posterior

05:19.902 --> 05:22.488
the size of a Texas League
ruby red grapefruit--

05:22.572 --> 05:25.825
Renko, would you just shut up?
Would you shut up, please?

05:25.908 --> 05:27.452
-...I've ever seen in--
-Shut up.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.121
-Huh?
-(laughter)

05:30.788 --> 05:33.583
HILL: No, not Thursday. Today, right now.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.293
Well, when will the doctor be in?

05:36.711 --> 05:39.088
Ma'am, is there any way
that you could reach him?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.341
-Hey, Bobby! Bobby!
-Now, you listen here, my good woman.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.885
This particular situation
falls under the category

05:43.968 --> 05:45.470
of a medical emergency.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.764
-That's right. I understand that.
-J.D., I appreciate this.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.183
You tell that doctor to ask himself
the same question

05:50.266 --> 05:52.685
the next time he wants to talk
to a police officer!

05:52.769 --> 05:54.812
-2:15 with J.D.'s doctor.
-Good.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.277
-Think you can hold off till then?
-Well, what choice do I have?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.738
-Come on, let's hit the streets.
-(screams)

06:03.821 --> 06:06.574
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:08.368
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:08.451 --> 06:12.330
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:12.413 --> 06:13.998
(sirens wailing)

06:19.462 --> 06:23.383
(theme music playing)

07:48.217 --> 07:49.760
(telephone ringing)

07:49.844 --> 07:53.639
I'm expecting a report on Mizell
from Jerry Fuchs this morning.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.725
We'll go over it as thoroughly as possible

07:55.808 --> 07:57.810
and decide which points
need investigation.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.607
Is there a problem with something?

08:03.107 --> 08:05.485
We heard the D.A. gave up
the shooter to Federal, Captain.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.527
FURILLO: You heard correctly.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.489
Yeah, well, it's kinda tough
getting revved up after something that.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.534
That does not change the fact, J.D.,
that we have an investigation to conduct.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.497
I won't have anything missed just because
we weren't willing to go the full yard.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.332
What about the safe-deposit box?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.584
We're picking up the warrant
in an hour, meeting at the bank.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.336
You let me know as soon as it's done.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.465
Excuse me, Francis, the Stan Mizell file,
courtesy of Captain Fuchs.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.716
Just in time, Phil.

08:29.383 --> 08:34.388
I, uh, took the liberty of perusing it
on my way here from the front desk twice.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.059
To say it lacks detail is something
of an understatement.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.730
-FURILLO: Call Jerry Fuchs.
-ESTERHAUS: Right away, Francis.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.694
Yeah, file that one under
"Fuchs covering his rear."

08:48.778 --> 08:50.071
Wheels within wheels, J.D.,

08:50.154 --> 08:52.240
-that's out of my league, baby.
-Hm.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.453
Hey, that's pretty good.
Not great yet, but pretty good.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.163
Hello, Fay.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.921
-Well, hello, Fay.
--Oh, Fay, uh, I'm just on my way out--

09:07.004 --> 09:08.381
Crime, Frank.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.342
-I mean, it's everywhere, like a cancer.
-Fay, uh--

09:11.425 --> 09:14.637
-They mug, they murder, they rape!
-Fay, please.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.516
They even burglarize the homes
of police captains!

09:19.517 --> 09:20.476
Police captains?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.019
We've been robbed, Frank.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.729
I was taking Frank Jr. to school--

09:23.813 --> 09:25.606
-Is he all right?
-Yeah, he's fine.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.484
But they've obviously been casing me.
They knew my whole schedule!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.571
-Oh, my God!
-What happened?

09:31.654 --> 09:34.991
Well, I dropped Frank Jr. off,
and then I went to my aerobics class.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.368
And when I got home, boom!

09:37.451 --> 09:40.705
I mean, the silverware,
the television, the stereo!

09:40.788 --> 09:45.042
They took the photo albums, I mean,
all the way back to our wedding album!

09:45.793 --> 09:48.629
What would they want
with something like that?

09:48.713 --> 09:53.217
I tell you, when I walked in that door
and saw what they'd done,

09:53.301 --> 09:56.721
(sobs) I felt so violated!

09:56.804 --> 09:58.055
Fay, I know exactly what you mean.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.142
When they dismembered my Buick,
I felt physically defiled.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.770
Phil, would you get me Detective Walsh
in Midtown, please?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.731
I'm sorry. I hate to bother you--

10:06.814 --> 10:09.567
It's no bother,
but you're insured, aren't you?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.360
Uh, Detective Walsh.
Captain Furillo calling.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.571
It's not that. It's--

10:14.238 --> 10:17.533
You see, they not only took things.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.827
They also left something.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.457
A small token of their esteem

10:24.999 --> 10:28.628
in the living room on the rug.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.089
Oh, Fay...

10:32.173 --> 10:37.511
I mean, what kind of a demented creature
would do something like that?

10:37.928 --> 10:40.389
-Francis, he's on.
-Uh, easy.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.060
Uh, yeah. Captain Furillo. Yeah.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.188
-For... for Detective Wal-- Yeah.
-WALSH:<i> Yeah.</i>

10:47.271 --> 10:48.564
I don't know, Fay.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.483
I'm just glad you and Frank
weren't there to find out.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.152
Listen, uh, you go back there,

10:53.235 --> 10:55.237
and somebody will be there
right away, okay?

10:55.321 --> 11:00.701
Uh, Fay, you might try some pine oil
and a spot of vinegar on the spot.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.745
I used to have a cocker spaniel.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.920
-Yeah, I'm holding.
-Frank?

11:13.005 --> 11:17.551
One more thing.
Um, you remember our home movies?

11:17.635 --> 11:22.723
You know, the films of you in high school
and, uh, the ones of us?

11:25.351 --> 11:28.062
DANIELS: The front lines
of the urban battleground

11:28.145 --> 11:31.774
have grown increasingly ambiguous
with the passage of time.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.486
We find ourselves in the position
of fighting not only crime,

11:35.569 --> 11:40.616
but poverty, hunger, injustice,
and a host of other social ills.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.078
And it was to this pitched battle

11:44.954 --> 11:47.581
that officer Stan Mizell
dedicated his life,

11:48.207 --> 11:49.875
a warrior to the end,

11:50.251 --> 11:52.962
a victim of the war
to which each and every one of you

11:53.045 --> 11:57.591
has pledged yourself,
a staunch link in the last line of defense

11:57.675 --> 12:01.053
between a free society
and a lawless frontier.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.265
Uh, would any of you gentlemen
care to do the honors?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.600
-You can proceed, Mr. LaRue.
-With pleasure.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.312
Oh-ho! Give 'em hell, Mizell.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.232
Okay, for starters,
one incredibly hefty roll

12:13.315 --> 12:15.735
mint-condition Ben Franklin
special editions.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.904
-Must be at least $20,000 there.
-Try $40,000.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.490
Whatever you wanna say
about old Stan, he had initiative.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.119
One Saturday night special, generic.

12:25.703 --> 12:29.415
Hey-hey! One pair fur-lined,
double-locking handcuffs,

12:29.498 --> 12:31.751
definitely not department ordinance.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.379
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Uh-oh.

12:35.463 --> 12:39.592
One, two bags unidentified powdery
white substance.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.136
My guess, confectioners' sugar it ain't.

12:42.219 --> 12:46.056
He epitomized that which
all of us strive to achieve,

12:47.391 --> 12:49.101
dedication to service,

12:50.102 --> 12:51.687
strength of character,

12:52.938 --> 12:55.316
loyalty to his friends and colleagues.

12:55.399 --> 12:59.695
But first and foremost,
Stan Mizell was a family man,

12:59.779 --> 13:04.784
a loving father to his children,
a devoted husband to his wife, Abigail.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.869
LARUE: One pair ladies' underpants,

13:06.952 --> 13:08.871
ventilated for comfortable summer wearing.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.915
Was he the life of the party or what?

13:11.832 --> 13:12.833
Our last item.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.212
Hey, what collection would be truly
complete without a deluxe assortment

13:16.295 --> 13:19.298
of incredibly personal photographs?

13:19.381 --> 13:21.217
WASHINGTON: Unbelievable, man.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.094
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I know this girl.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.888
Which one? This one?

13:26.597 --> 13:27.765
Yeah.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.185
I don't know.
It's kinda hard to tell with the mask.

13:31.602 --> 13:35.773
DANIELS: Words seem inadequate
at such a time as this.

13:35.856 --> 13:40.820
Opportunities for heroism are rare enough
in such a world as this.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.780
-(Bobby groans)
-Let us simply remember

13:42.863 --> 13:45.741
the actions of a hero and be grateful.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.212
Rifle team, ten-hut!

13:59.129 --> 14:01.757
Rifle team, ready position, hut!

14:03.551 --> 14:05.886
Ready? Aim...

14:07.054 --> 14:07.888
fire!

14:07.972 --> 14:09.431
(gunshot)

14:09.515 --> 14:12.184
Ready? Aim...

14:12.268 --> 14:13.310
fire!

14:13.394 --> 14:14.603
(gunshot)

14:14.687 --> 14:15.563
Ready?

14:16.313 --> 14:19.608
-Aim... fire!
-(gunshot)

14:24.864 --> 14:26.198
("Taps" playing)

14:32.746 --> 14:36.083
-Captain?
-Detective Walsh?

14:36.166 --> 14:40.462
I just wanna let you know
I spoke to your wife or your ex-wife.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.675
-We're onto this burglary hard.
-I appreciate it.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.470
As far as that little calling card
they left is concerned,

14:48.554 --> 14:49.930
I wouldn't worry about it.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.269
-No?
-Primitive form of disdain.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.780
(groaning)

15:09.617 --> 15:10.784
Frank?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.456
I'm sorry about missing
your phone call this morning,

15:15.539 --> 15:16.790
but I was, uh, hung up.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.250
If it was about the Mizell file--

15:18.334 --> 15:20.669
It was. I'd like to talk to you
in my office if you can get away.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.879
Uh, sure.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.301
(grunts)

15:28.928 --> 15:30.346
-Furillo!
-Councilman.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.974
I just got a fascinating message
about a safe-deposit box,

15:34.058 --> 15:36.769
one that belonged to a recently
deceased police hero.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.228
You're not gonna believe what was in it.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.898
-For instance?
-I don't wanna spoil it for you.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.776
The point is,
you backed the wrong horse, bucko.

15:43.859 --> 15:48.113
I've got enough to pin cover-up on Daniels
with or without your help.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.032
I am going to bury you and your chief

15:50.115 --> 15:53.160
deeper than we just planted
that piece of dirt back there.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.206
So ask yourself, Frank, was he worth it?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.847
Uh, Mrs. Mizell?

16:14.598 --> 16:15.516
-Yes?
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.

16:15.599 --> 16:19.603
I'm Captain Furillo, Hill Street.
I wanted to offer my condolences.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.566
He gave the job everything, you know.
He tried so hard.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.448
-He was an impressive man.
-(sobs)

16:32.366 --> 16:34.493
Did you hear what the captain
said about Daddy?

16:37.579 --> 16:39.915
I hardly saw him the last few weeks.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.459
He said it was something big.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.839
I mean, you really needed him, didn't you?

16:48.048 --> 16:49.591
He was important to you?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.302
He certainly was.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.348
We have to go home now.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.726
Thank you, Captain.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.734
(engine starts)

17:08.819 --> 17:11.822
You want garbage? I'll give ya garbage!

17:11.905 --> 17:13.907
Here's your stinkin' garbage!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.076
(indistinct yelling)

17:16.160 --> 17:19.329
-You get them new trash cans, all right?
-Okay, okay!

17:19.413 --> 17:23.000
-I'll buy them a couple new cans.
-Did you hear that?

17:23.083 --> 17:26.628
He's gonna get you new cans,
so stop the airmail!

17:27.129 --> 17:28.714
We're sick of waiting!

17:28.797 --> 17:29.923
Yeah, right.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.633
Come on.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.848
Have a nice day.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.602
He's getting you new cans!

17:44.271 --> 17:45.564
Man...

17:46.774 --> 17:49.401
Joe, did you leave the back door open?

17:50.027 --> 17:52.321
Oh, man, there goes another radio.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.620
Joe...

18:11.673 --> 18:12.925
-(cooing)
-Hey...

18:13.008 --> 18:14.176
You're kidding me.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.100
-How's the tush?
-I got a 2:15 appointment with the knife.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.769
-Nasty. Hi, Howard.
-(groaning)

18:23.852 --> 18:25.145
Henry.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.272
Some funeral, huh?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.274
Indeed.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.737
You, uh, you going somewhere?

18:35.405 --> 18:36.824
What are you implying, Henry?

18:38.075 --> 18:41.620
-Implying? Nothing.
-It is 11:25 in the morning.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.789
Have you ever known me
to goldbrick on company time?

18:43.872 --> 18:46.250
-I think not.
-I'm sorry I asked, believe me.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.419
A man just pays a little extra
attention to his grooming

18:49.503 --> 18:50.879
after burying the dead.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.756
It's the natural response

18:52.840 --> 18:56.218
against the inevitable encroachment
of decay and entropy.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.971
-Naturally.
-Yes.

18:59.179 --> 19:03.392
Lessons of war cut deep, Henry,
rites of passage.

19:04.643 --> 19:08.188
In death, find life.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.487
-Lieutenant.
-(toilet flushes)

19:15.571 --> 19:17.197
Eau de P. U.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.828
JOE: No, no line on an I.D. yet.
We're sending a footprint over to county.

19:23.453 --> 19:28.041
Oh, what a cute little baby.
Give me that little footsie.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.335
-That's it. That's good.
-They'll send somebody over.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.422
And now let's have this one.
That's a good little fella.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.591
Now stand him up here. There you go.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.342
Get the little footsie here.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.012
That's a good boy.
Now this little footsie.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.556
Ooh, such a good, good baby!

19:42.639 --> 19:43.932
We've got such good prints here.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.519
Well, look at that.
It's public enemy<i> numero uno</i>.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.647
At last the law has caught up with you
and stopped your life of crime.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.317
-Look at this little stinker here, huh?
-(mumbles)

19:53.400 --> 19:55.194
-Captain.
-Hey, bunky!

19:55.277 --> 19:56.945
What a cutie, huh?

19:57.029 --> 20:00.574
(indistinct baby talk)

20:00.657 --> 20:02.784
(camera shutter clicks)

20:03.911 --> 20:05.704
Come on. Hold her still, will ya?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.082
Okay, come on, baby, let's have a smile.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.584
No lead on the parents, Lucy?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.044
-Now, smile, baby.
-No, not yet, Captain.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.840
I just can't understand why anybody
would wanna dump a kid like this.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.634
Especially a quality baby like that.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.302
Why don't you just go canvass
the neighborhood.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.804
-Someone may have seen something.
-Here you go, Luce.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.681
-Oh, thanks.
-Yeah.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.149
Boy, he sure is cute. Hmm?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.698
What are you doing here, hairbag?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.951
Oh, Mick, thank goodness, a friendly face.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.370
-What is it, Alf?
-Soliciting, Mick.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.290
Mick, this handsome middle-aged man
asked me for a match.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.334
I said, "How about you and me?"

20:53.502 --> 20:55.420
What can I say? I'm a hopeless romantic.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.133
-You get a complaint from the john?
-His lawyer's handling it.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.803
Let me talk to him.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.888
-Take him.
-Come here.

21:10.060 --> 21:14.481
Stand straight, would you, please?
And don't give me that goofy look.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.651
I'm very disappointed in you.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.112
Mick, I don't know what to do.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.739
I'd like to change...

21:23.740 --> 21:25.575
(stammers) ...but I can't.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.539
Come on, now. Don't... don't do that.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.418
Eddie, it's very simple.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.337
First thing is,
you gotta find yourself a job.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.382
It's not so hard, either.
All you gotta do is look.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.844
Well, I had a job offer just
the other day, waiting tables.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.013
I told them I'd have to think about it.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.557
-That's terrific. Where?
-The Darkroom.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.602
The Darkroom? It's a flesh pit.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.479
The waiters dress up like executioners.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.773
I know. It's so butch.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.321
-Who was with you?
-Bank official, couple of attorneys. I.E.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.822
-What a mess.
-Mm.

22:05.115 --> 22:05.949
Frank?

22:08.493 --> 22:09.703
-Captain.
-How you doing?

22:17.961 --> 22:19.338
This is a joke, Jerry.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.633
-No dates, no names.
-It's the file.

22:24.468 --> 22:30.015
An undercover cop is required to write
a complete report of his movements,

22:30.098 --> 22:33.935
observations, and contacts
every day he's on the job.

22:34.019 --> 22:38.231
-That's all there is, Frank.
-Jerry, how could you let him?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.484
Don't use that tone of voice with me.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.487
This isn't school, and I'm not a damn kid.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.114
I had to give Mizell a free rein.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.033
In two weeks,
he was gonna close the biggest--

22:48.116 --> 22:51.161
Get off it, Jerry.
He wasn't about to close anything.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.039
He was an outlaw, and he was running you.

22:54.456 --> 22:58.585
God, look at this stuff,
drugs, hypodermic,

22:59.211 --> 23:03.298
firearms, pornography, $20,000 in cash.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.925
That's the kind of police work
he was doing,

23:05.008 --> 23:07.803
and it was only a matter of time
before he made you pay for it.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.139
What are you gonna do with it, the file?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.850
Take it to Daniels right now.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.145
-Why?
-Because it's my job.

23:17.771 --> 23:22.401
Frank, I'm caught between two fat-cat
city legislators who wanna be mayor.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.238
That's what I'm guilty of!
Twenty years, Frank!

23:26.321 --> 23:29.574
Twenty years we've known each other,
and you're gonna hurt me for that?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.661
I wouldn't have done it to you.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.248
I wouldn't have let myself
get into your situation, Jerry.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.168
There you go.

23:49.052 --> 23:52.264
Police officers, ma'am.
This is a search-and-seizure order.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.766
We're gonna have to ask your patients
here to vacate the premises.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.018
-J.D., you wanna get the files in there?
-Right, A to Z.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.770
-Mick, what are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

23:58.854 --> 24:01.189
Mick, you're barking up the wrong tree,
Mick. This guy is clean!

24:01.273 --> 24:03.066
His credentials are impeccable.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.609
He has got a degree

24:04.693 --> 24:06.611
from the University
of New Delhi Chiropractic.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.406
-You wanna put a cork in it, Renko?
-Tell him, J.D.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.324
I hope you don't have
any stock in this place, Andy.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.660
Nichols, you wanna get
some pictures over here, please?

24:13.743 --> 24:15.579
By the way, where's your partner?

24:15.662 --> 24:18.999
This is a cruel and cold thing
you're doing, J.D.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.877
Renko, either give us a hand
or stay out of the way.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.212
What is the meaning of this?
Okay, what is the meaning of this?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.089
You're under arrest, dog breath.
I got a warrant here for your arrest.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.883
You can't do this. What are you doing?

24:27.966 --> 24:30.427
-Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Don't do that!

24:30.510 --> 24:32.471
-(overlapping chatter)
-This is a doctor's office!

24:32.554 --> 24:33.597
If I were you, I'd call a lawyer.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.225
I'm a doctor,
and I'm in a very delicate surgery.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.602
I cannot be being disturbed

24:38.685 --> 24:41.605
-by any tomfoolery!
-Hey! I'm talking to you!

24:41.688 --> 24:44.107
-This is very bad.
-Hey, hey, let's look in the back.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.401
No, no. Please don't go back there.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.111
You can't go back there!

24:48.195 --> 24:51.406
-(clamoring)
-Don't go back there!

24:51.490 --> 24:52.532
Bobby!

24:52.616 --> 24:55.702
Bobby, my man! How you doing?
Are you all right?

24:55.785 --> 24:57.913
Bobby, Bobby! I'm sorry.
I did everything--

24:57.996 --> 24:59.748
This is what I'm trying to tell you!

24:59.831 --> 25:01.917
-Do something, Renko!
-Be quiet! Come here, Mick.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.877
Now, look, I can guarantee you,
my partner's not gonna last

25:03.960 --> 25:05.962
another ten minutes on
the street without getting the relief

25:06.046 --> 25:07.672
this alleged perpetrator
was about to perform.

25:07.756 --> 25:12.802
-Is really that bad?
-(overlapping conversations)

25:12.886 --> 25:14.804
I'm gonna get you, J.D.!
I'll kill you for this!

25:14.888 --> 25:18.099
-All right, Doc, get it done fast.
-Thank you. Very nice.

25:24.981 --> 25:28.985
Is it asking too much,
or could I possibly have a little privacy?

25:29.069 --> 25:31.613
LARUE: Uh, we should not leave
a suspect unguarded.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.614
That's by the book.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.699
Renko, don't just stand there,
do something!

25:34.783 --> 25:36.952
Look, we better get some
documentation on this, okay?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.870
Hey, Bobby, you might be staring a major--

25:38.954 --> 25:40.622
Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

25:40.705 --> 25:43.625
(laughs)
Don't worry. I only shot your good side.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.168
Renko!

25:45.252 --> 25:47.671
-(laughter)
-(Bobby screams)

26:06.231 --> 26:08.108
-Yeah?
-Are you Cindy?

26:09.025 --> 26:11.653
-Yeah. What do you want?
-Is this your baby?

26:12.696 --> 26:14.281
I don't know nothin' about a baby.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.533
Well, the lady downstairs
says she's seen you with him.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.160
-She's crazy.
-What is it? What's wrong here?

26:19.244 --> 26:21.454
-It's nothing, Mama.
-What's the little whore done now?

26:21.538 --> 26:22.998
I didn't do nothing.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.542
We're looking for the mother
of this abandoned child.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.836
-(clamoring)
-Hold it!

26:27.919 --> 26:31.339
I'm gonna kill her!
You dumped that baby, you little tramp!

26:31.423 --> 26:35.302
(screams, grunts) No! Help!

26:35.385 --> 26:38.847
I should have left you
in the street 15 years ago!

26:38.930 --> 26:42.767
You want your mother? You got your mother!

26:43.351 --> 26:44.603
No!

26:46.646 --> 26:49.733
-(stations changing)
-(band music plays)

26:58.867 --> 27:00.493
-Linda?
-Hmm?

27:00.785 --> 27:02.245
May I speak freely?

27:03.747 --> 27:04.998
I wish you would.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.292
Oh...

27:07.876 --> 27:11.004
Since meeting you, I've realized
that there is a part of my life

27:11.087 --> 27:14.799
that has been A.W.O.L.
for longer than I care to admit.

27:16.092 --> 27:20.847
It's time I checked out of the B.O.Q.
and went T.D.Y.

27:22.557 --> 27:27.187
I long for kitchen detail
and the sound of little feet marching.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.148
Are you re-enlisting?

27:33.151 --> 27:35.236
I want to make an honest woman out of you.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.324
I want you to be my wife.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.829
Oh.

27:46.414 --> 27:50.126
Oh, my darling Howard...

27:51.628 --> 27:53.129
I love you so.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.724
-Then it's "yes"?
-No.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.769
No?

28:08.436 --> 28:09.646
Oh, Howard...

28:13.358 --> 28:17.237
My parents are very old-world.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.155
And I...

28:19.948 --> 28:23.326
I just could never marry
anyone they disapprove of.

28:23.410 --> 28:27.414
-Well, how could they disapprove of me?
-We're of different faiths.

28:29.040 --> 28:29.999
Oh.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.293
Of course, there is a way.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.587
You could convert.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.550
Convert?

28:41.720 --> 28:42.887
Convert to what?

28:42.971 --> 28:45.140
To Judaism, of course.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.641
You mean...

28:48.977 --> 28:50.353
You mean like that colored singer?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.272
-Howard!
-Oh, don't get me wrong,

28:52.355 --> 28:54.149
I think he's a marvelous entertainer.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.444
-The Mizell case.
-Thank you.

28:59.362 --> 29:03.116
I think you'll find
Jerry's day notes incomplete.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.453
-I see.
-In fact, uh...

29:06.953 --> 29:09.998
you're gonna find
the entire Mizell file incomplete,

29:10.081 --> 29:13.418
so, uh, I hope you'll consider
Captain Fuchs' conduct

29:13.501 --> 29:16.212
in the largest possible context.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.966
He's given 19 years
of distinctive service.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.343
Point taken, Frank.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.597
Now, let me ask you for some judgments.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.892
If you were Fletcher Daniels,

29:30.101 --> 29:34.063
and you were considering
this whole situation

29:34.147 --> 29:35.523
from that vantage point,

29:37.108 --> 29:38.526
tell me what course you'd pursue.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.779
If I were Fletcher Daniels?

29:43.865 --> 29:46.367
I'd bail out of the deal
with drug enforcement,

29:47.076 --> 29:49.037
I'd bring Mizell's killer
back to the Hill,

29:49.120 --> 29:50.997
charge him with murder,
and give him due process.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.833
It'd mean exposing some dirty linen.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.295
A department that's substantially clean
can stand that.

29:57.378 --> 29:58.880
It ought to be able to stand it.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.552
Wachtel and Gerber, Wachtel and Gerber,

30:04.636 --> 30:08.223
Wachtel and Gerber,
all Wachtel and Gerber.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.643
They've been shooting you an awful lot
of business here, Doc.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.312
Some real interesting cases, too.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.733
They got six different people here
with the same broken foot.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.735
Okay, okay.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.740
Two years ago, I come to the country.
I'm already a doctor, okay?

30:26.115 --> 30:30.537
And I'm looking for a lawyer to help me
with my naturalization processes.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.790
BELKER: And you found two of them, right?
Wachtel and Gerber.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.626
(speaks in Hindi)

30:36.709 --> 30:40.922
Hey, curry breath, your immigration status
is hanging by a thread here.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.173
Talk American.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.134
Okay. I tell you anything.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.303
BELKER: Just tell me
about Wachtel and Gerber.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.763
Okay.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.890
They are sending me these peoples.

30:51.349 --> 30:54.644
I know this is very bad,
because they're not sick.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.563
I can tell, I am a doctor.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.690
But they're telling me,

30:59.774 --> 31:03.069
"No green card, Spanzik,
if you are not seeing these peoples."

31:03.152 --> 31:05.071
They were blackmailing you, huh?

31:05.405 --> 31:07.615
All the time, they were blackmailing me.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.034
That's very strange,
because according to your files,

31:10.118 --> 31:13.580
you were pulling in ten percent
of a $15,000-a-week turnover.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.874
Oh, God, I love this country!

31:16.833 --> 31:18.459
I want to be an American doctor.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.550
Yeah, well, you know, after giving
my situation considerable thought,

31:25.633 --> 31:28.136
I have decided
that your original offer of $6,000

31:28.219 --> 31:30.221
would just about cover my expenses.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.806
How soon can I pick up the check?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.852
No, no, no. Mr. Wachtel
will not be handling the case,

31:35.935 --> 31:37.145
as it turns out.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.898
I kind of figured that if you
and I got together directly

31:39.981 --> 31:41.900
and saved everybody a lot of paperwork

31:41.983 --> 31:45.361
and kept my premiums
from going into orbit in the bargain,

31:45.445 --> 31:47.697
I'd take the $6,000, if you get my drift.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.954
Yeah, $2,000 even is reasonable.
How soon can I get the check?

31:59.250 --> 32:00.752
Henry, old sport.

32:01.836 --> 32:05.048
I wanted to apologize
if I seemed a bit harsh with you earlier.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.049
Oh, listen, it was nothing.

32:06.132 --> 32:10.178
I was wondering if I could ask you
a direct and personal question.

32:10.845 --> 32:12.430
Sure. Fire away.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.767
What is it like being a Hebrew?

32:19.854 --> 32:22.899
Well, I don't know, Howard.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.151
What's it like being a human being?

32:28.237 --> 32:29.948
Well, it's not a cakewalk, Henry.

32:31.282 --> 32:35.161
-(cooing)
-Yeah... yeah.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.624
Don't you wanna feed your baby?

32:41.834 --> 32:42.835
No.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.465
You sure are some tough piece of work.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.926
(baby coos)

32:50.510 --> 32:51.844
Do you ever have a kid?

32:52.428 --> 32:53.888
What difference does it make?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.810
You never had some baby keep crying on you

32:58.893 --> 33:01.104
when you did everything
you were supposed to.

33:01.187 --> 33:05.191
-So you left him out in the street?
-I put him in a cop car.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.318
I knew he'd get took care of.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.737
-Oh, you knew that, huh?
-Yeah.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.240
Your baby cries, so out he goes.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.075
You don't pick him up, you don't hug him--

33:14.158 --> 33:16.119
I was gonna hit him!

33:16.869 --> 33:18.079
(sobs)

33:20.081 --> 33:23.418
It was gonna be just like
my mama did to me.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.014
Don't you understand that?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.940
You better burp him.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.613
(sniffles)

33:53.948 --> 33:56.451
(cooing)

33:58.911 --> 33:59.996
It's okay.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.917
(indistinct conversations)

34:09.130 --> 34:13.718
Well, well, well.
Just the man I've been looking for, J.D.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.470
I've been huddling
with the claims adjuster--

34:15.553 --> 34:17.472
Hey. I'm sorry, guy, but I'm really busy.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.058
-I'll catch you later.
-What are you talking about?

34:20.141 --> 34:21.893
You are under arrest, cheese breath.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.436
-What?
-You have the right to an attorney.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.688
-If you cannot afford an attorney...
-What the hell is this?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.982
Keep your paws off me,
you filthy little ape!

34:28.066 --> 34:30.068
...will be used against you
in a court of law.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.612
LaRue? Hey, LaRue! What's the charge?

34:32.695 --> 34:36.365
Felony fraud, grand theft,
conspiracy to defraud.

34:37.575 --> 34:38.743
You're a dead man, LaRue.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.620
I hope you got other career plans,

34:40.703 --> 34:43.289
because I'm hitting you
with a civil suit so hard

34:43.372 --> 34:45.041
it'll cross your eyes!

34:45.124 --> 34:47.627
This is false arrest,
malicious prosecution,

34:47.710 --> 34:50.004
unnecessary force, abuse of office--

34:50.088 --> 34:51.964
BELKER: If you don't can it,
you're gonna be talking

34:52.048 --> 34:53.841
out of the side of your neck, dog brain.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.553
Nice cuff links, Alan.
Morals charge, or just felony bad taste?

34:57.637 --> 34:58.679
Come on.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.391
Where'd you get the shiner, Joycie?
Doing push-ups on the curb?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.311
DANIELS (on TV):<i> Comment on</i>
<i>any unsubstantiated rumors</i>

35:05.394 --> 35:08.606
<i>concerning the activities</i>
<i>of officer Stan Mizell,</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:12.527

35:12.610 --> 35:14.195
<i>as it has been from the beginning,</i>

35:14.570 --> 35:17.156

35:21.994 --> 35:24.163
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>Chief Daniels, it's been suggested</i>

35:24.247 --> 35:27.166
<i>that because you're running for mayor</i>
<i>against Councilman Detweiler--</i>

35:27.458 --> 35:31.170
<i>Um, we're not here to discuss</i>
<i>Councilman Detweiler</i>

35:31.254 --> 35:34.382
<i>or his affinity for the finer points</i>

36:00.575 --> 36:02.869
-(TV clicks off)
-Quite a performance.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.705
Adjectives like "slick"
and "nimble" spring to mind.

36:06.914 --> 36:09.208
Excuse me.
Councilman Detweiler on line three.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.668
Tell him I'm out.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.380
To use the vernacular,
he's in a bit of a lather.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.632
Tell him I'm out for a month.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.634
(Phil chuckles)

36:18.718 --> 36:22.638
He said something about seeing your head
on a pike out front of city hall.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.809
-Just hang up on him, Phil.
-Yes, Captain.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.312
Oh! Ms. Davenport,

36:29.395 --> 36:31.606
we have your mugging suspect
out of holding.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.149
Thank you, Sergeant. I'll be there.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.780
What's the councilman so upset about?

36:41.157 --> 36:44.410
-He thinks I stabbed him in the back.
-Did you?

36:47.788 --> 36:50.541
(telephones ringing)

36:51.167 --> 36:54.420
-This is Mrs. Morgenstern.
-Hi.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.549
-Careful, now.
-I know. (chuckles)

36:58.633 --> 37:00.927
I wanna thank you
for the fine job you've done.

37:01.802 --> 37:02.887
This must be Cindy.

37:03.804 --> 37:04.764
Hi.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.058
Cindy, would you go
with this officer, please?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.355
-Bye, Cindy.
-Bye, Cindy.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.193
Well, bye.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.461
That's a good argument
for birth control, isn't it?

37:40.424 --> 37:43.386
It sort of makes you wish you
had one of your own, though, doesn't it?

37:43.928 --> 37:45.137
Yeah, sometimes.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.225
You have any candidates
in mind for the father?

37:50.434 --> 37:52.895
Will you give me a break?
I don't even have a boyfriend.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.356
Looking for volunteers?

37:57.483 --> 37:59.819
You know, sometimes I think
that you don't know anything at all

37:59.902 --> 38:03.322
about babies or women or anything.

38:11.163 --> 38:13.916
Excuse me, sir?
My name is Andy Renko, and, uh,

38:14.000 --> 38:15.793
I believe you have a turkey here for me.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.920
Oh, yeah. Be right with ya.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.922
I tell you, it is kismet, Bobby.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.300
I've got a couple bottles of...
(speaks French) ...in my fridge.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.552
-You say?
-And if you and the lady of your choice

38:24.635 --> 38:26.387
would like to join me
and my Teresa this evening,

38:26.470 --> 38:29.807
we will partake of the finest
of this city's prize gobblers.

38:30.266 --> 38:35.146
Well, here he is, pal, 34 pounds.
Ain't he a beaut?

38:38.482 --> 38:39.984
-He's alive.
-Of course he is.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.528
-(laughs)
-You don't freeze a bird like this.

38:42.903 --> 38:45.406
I just thought you'd like
to take a look at him first.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.952
I didn't know anything about this, fellow.
They just called my name in a raffle.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.704
(chuckling)

38:54.165 --> 38:56.542
This thing is leaking all over the seat!

38:56.625 --> 38:58.794
-Your boil?
-No, fool, your bird.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.754
My bird?

38:59.837 --> 39:02.381
Hey, will you just do something
about it, Bobby Hill?

39:02.465 --> 39:04.467
Just clean it up with a towel
or something like that!

39:04.550 --> 39:07.219
You know, you would think that
the guy would have some sense

39:07.303 --> 39:08.512
and know how to wrap the damn thing.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.307
All I wanna do is get
that poor carcass home,

39:11.390 --> 39:13.893
cook it up, and get it off my conscience.

39:13.976 --> 39:18.272
The look in that poor creature's eyes
will haunt me until my dying day.

39:18.814 --> 39:21.650
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Any unit</i>
<i>in the vicinity, ambulance traffic,</i>

39:21.734 --> 39:24.820
<i>vehicle versus pedestrian,</i>
<i>96th and Dekker.</i>

39:25.321 --> 39:27.823
That's us. 2202 responding.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.949
All right, I'll take this one.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.992
(indistinct conversations)

40:19.875 --> 40:21.335
Councilman Detweiler.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.964
(stuttering) She ran right out.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.632
She ran...

40:28.342 --> 40:29.260
directly...

40:30.010 --> 40:31.929
(sirens wailing)

40:45.276 --> 40:47.153
(indistinct conversations)

40:47.236 --> 40:49.697
(indistinct shouting)

40:56.704 --> 40:58.622
All right, Mr. Detweiler,
if you'll have a seat right here,

40:58.706 --> 40:59.999
we're gonna have to book you.

41:00.708 --> 41:05.588
You have the right to one telephone call,
no more than three minutes in length.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.715
I'd like to see your driver's license
right here on the table.

41:07.798 --> 41:08.966
Television people are arriving.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.759
Keep them out there, Phil.
I'll issue a statement.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.512
He's so drunk
he can hardly stand, Captain.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.181
(Detweiler slurring) Frank...

41:15.347 --> 41:19.685
I want my personal physician
to look after this woman.

41:20.436 --> 41:25.357
We'll take care of her.
I'll take full responsibility myself.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.068
We can just call the hospital.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.237
Frank...

41:31.363 --> 41:32.740
I'll make it right.

41:35.242 --> 41:36.869
RENKO: Is this your current address?

41:39.872 --> 41:42.458
Frank... I just heard.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.793
-Moment?
-Sure.

41:50.216 --> 41:53.219
Damn it, Frank, you had Detweiler
pegged from the get-go.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.638
I should have listened and seen to it

41:55.721 --> 41:57.973
the poor drunken wretch
got eased out to pasture.

41:58.057 --> 41:58.933
It would have been for his own good.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.894
Oh, and about our meeting earlier--

42:03.103 --> 42:04.522
I appreciate the input.

42:05.397 --> 42:08.025
We did right bringing the Mizell thing
out in the open.

42:09.151 --> 42:11.111
We'll get it behind us,
and we can spend our time

42:11.195 --> 42:13.197
getting this department back on its feet.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.949
What's gonna happen to Jerry Fuchs?

42:15.407 --> 42:19.870
Well, he probably shouldn't be thinking
in terms of upward mobility.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.540
But he's very secure
in his present position.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.293
(snaps fingers) Speaking of which,
the commander's test,

42:27.044 --> 42:28.921
it's gonna be given in a couple of weeks.

42:30.172 --> 42:31.882
You were planning on taking it,
weren't you?

42:31.966 --> 42:34.760
-I hadn't given it much thought.
-I would.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.639
It's good to see you
on the move again, Frank.

42:41.016 --> 42:41.934
What?

42:43.310 --> 42:45.854
Well, the drinking,
your personal problems,

42:45.938 --> 42:48.023
I admire you putting all that behind you.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.818
Shows conviction. Shows potential.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.279
I'm gonna have to keep my eye on you.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.074
Excuse me.

42:57.616 --> 43:00.661
Uh, the hospital just phoned, Francis,
Detweiler's victim...

43:02.580 --> 43:03.622
She didn't make it.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.714
Tough luck, Arnie.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.934
You know, I've been thinking.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.729
I could take my 20 years in a few months.

43:27.438 --> 43:31.900
It wouldn't be so bad,
play a little golf, go fishing.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.444
FURILLO: Jerry, if Daniels gets his wish,

43:33.527 --> 43:35.863
he's not gonna be
Chief of Police much longer.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.990
I wouldn't give up on
the department just yet.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.535
-I guess stranger things have happened.
-With some frequency.

43:42.411 --> 43:46.040
Francis, uh, Detective Walsh
messengered this over.

43:46.874 --> 43:47.916
Thanks, Phil.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.844
Ma! Ma!

43:59.261 --> 44:03.223
Well, calm down. She's not gonna sue.
She's a nurse.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.352
How many stitches?

44:08.103 --> 44:10.898
Well, she had to provoke him, then,
because Pop would never...

44:13.942 --> 44:15.402
What did I tell you about that?

44:15.903 --> 44:19.031
I told you that when the time comes,
I would take care of that.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.992
We agreed that this would be my decision.

44:22.826 --> 44:24.912
No, you will not go without me.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.414
You are stabbing me in the heart
with this!

44:30.918 --> 44:35.130
All right, I'll take care of it.
Just tell me where it is, and what is it?

44:37.007 --> 44:40.052
West Knoll Nursing Home.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.389
What time is the appointment?

44:47.851 --> 44:49.687
Don't cry, Ma, please.

44:50.437 --> 44:51.647
It'll be okay.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.109
I'll call you later. Goodbye.

45:00.155 --> 45:01.031
WOMAN: Hi.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.243
How you feeling?

45:05.494 --> 45:08.038
Oh, I'm feeling just great, thank you.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.041
Yeah, well, um,

45:11.500 --> 45:14.837
I thought you might like
to have these pictures back.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.132
And, uh...

45:18.674 --> 45:19.967
Well, I don't blame you if you say no,

45:20.050 --> 45:23.387
but I was hoping you'd let me buy you
a drink so I could apologize.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.639
No.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.436
Uh, you know, I realize that you think

45:30.519 --> 45:33.063
your backside is God's gift
to mankind, Officer Hill,

45:33.147 --> 45:34.648
but it was only a joke.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.067
Listen, lady,
I was in a lot of pain today,

45:37.818 --> 45:38.902
and you embarrassed the hell out of me,

45:38.986 --> 45:41.613
so excuse me if I don't think
it was so damn funny.

45:44.241 --> 45:47.703
You know, I was always told
that the guys up here loved a good gag.

45:47.786 --> 45:51.540
But I guess you must be one of the ones
that can dish it out but can't take it.

45:52.666 --> 45:55.252
-Maybe I am.
-And maybe I misjudged you.

45:55.335 --> 45:56.378
Maybe you did.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.383
Are you always this unforgiving,
Officer Hill?

46:03.510 --> 46:06.305
Hold it. Just hold it a second.

46:09.057 --> 46:12.352
Look, maybe...
maybe I was a little out of line.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.979
(scoffs)

46:15.731 --> 46:19.485
Maybe we could talk about it
over that drink.

46:23.405 --> 46:24.364
Night, Mick.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.456
How's it going?

46:35.709 --> 46:36.668
Not great.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.255
Your dad?

46:41.381 --> 46:43.884
We tried some home nurses with my father,

46:43.967 --> 46:47.095
and it just didn't--
He keeps slugging them.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.474
I'm going out to look
at some nursing homes.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.602
-Some of those--
-Some of them are very nice, I know.

46:57.022 --> 46:59.441
(projector whirring)

47:09.326 --> 47:10.494
You were cute.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.923
-(whirring stops)
-(sighs)

47:23.549 --> 47:24.716
Cheer up, Furillo.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.219
-None of us is getting any younger.
-Or better.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.680
The guy makes me want to wash.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.557
Who? Daniels?

47:32.391 --> 47:35.602
You hate to be on the same side with him,
even for different reasons.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.689
He gives you that knowing grin.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.234
So he's a politician.
You knew that already.

47:42.317 --> 47:44.111
Yeah. Trouble is, so am I.

47:44.987 --> 47:46.071
What's the problem?

47:47.072 --> 47:50.284
Seems to me you handled yourself
pretty well these last few days.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.703
You got the case reopened,
you protected Jerry Fuchs--

47:52.786 --> 47:54.746
None of which would have done me
a damn bit of good

47:54.830 --> 47:57.916
if Arnie Detweiler hadn't gotten drunk
and run over an old lady.

48:00.377 --> 48:04.590
(chuckles)
Luck is the residue of hard work.

48:04.673 --> 48:06.633
You're all heart, Counselor.

48:07.509 --> 48:09.303
I lost my heart, pizza man.

48:10.220 --> 48:13.807
I gave it to that skinny Italian kid
with the funny haircut.

48:27.362 --> 48:30.365
(closing theme playing)
