WEBVTT

00:01.187 --> 00:03.569
Oh, hey! They're opening something new!

00:03.601 --> 00:05.471
The Karen Club.

00:05.503 --> 00:07.239
- Aww, she sounds so nice.
- Yes!

00:07.272 --> 00:09.007
- Another woman-owned business.
- Mm-hmm.

00:09.041 --> 00:10.543
Okay, what do you think she's selling?

00:10.576 --> 00:11.977
- Uh, church hats?
- Hmm...

00:12.010 --> 00:13.478
Cardboard cutouts of Bravo characters?

00:13.512 --> 00:14.514
Bean bags?

00:14.547 --> 00:15.748
Books and wine.

00:15.781 --> 00:18.016
Books and wine?
That's our entire business!

00:18.050 --> 00:19.018
She's copying us!

00:19.050 --> 00:20.419
Maybe we should copy her back.

00:20.452 --> 00:21.754
And how would that work, Miggy?

00:23.888 --> 00:25.024
Just keep doing our thang.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.992
Ohh. Wow. That's deep.

00:27.025 --> 00:29.195
Okay, you know what?
There's room for everyone.

00:29.228 --> 00:31.905
It's fine, and our regulars
are very loyal, so...

00:31.944 --> 00:34.186
- There they are!
- What the hell?

00:34.271 --> 00:36.968
Fran, Bess, Lil!
You're going to The Karen Club?

00:38.570 --> 00:39.866
I don't think they heard you.

00:39.928 --> 00:41.663
Oh, they heard me. And they can see me.

00:41.749 --> 00:44.209
Hey! How's the wine over there, ladies?

00:44.243 --> 00:46.116
There's no way that you all got
a call at the same damn time.

00:46.155 --> 00:47.616
It could happen!

00:47.686 --> 00:50.082
Ooh...

00:50.297 --> 00:53.085
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

00:55.487 --> 00:57.022
It <i> is</i> a big deal

00:57.055 --> 00:58.857
the Winebrarians are
going to The Karen Club.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.225
They're our ringleaders.

01:00.259 --> 01:01.860
They're directly responsible
for our shift

01:01.893 --> 01:03.028
from Merlot to Syrah.

01:03.061 --> 01:04.462
If I lose them, I'm ruined.

01:04.495 --> 01:05.897
Screw The Karen Club.

01:05.930 --> 01:07.482
They're not gonna give me
free wine on my birthday.

01:07.507 --> 01:08.942
- Mnh-mnh.
- Hold up, A-Game.

01:08.967 --> 01:11.237
- When's your birthday?
- I... don't hate that nickname.

01:11.269 --> 01:12.905
Her birthday's tomorrow.

01:12.938 --> 01:14.646
- Your birthday is tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:14.678 --> 01:15.949
And you are 29.

01:15.974 --> 01:17.876
So that means... hmm...

01:17.909 --> 01:20.280
Let me just pull up
my calculator on my i...

01:21.246 --> 01:23.448
Tomorrow's your 30th birthday?!

01:23.481 --> 01:25.617
What are we gonna do?!

01:25.650 --> 01:27.753
Let's go through the categories
alphabetically, all right?

01:27.786 --> 01:28.987
Atmosphere, balloons,

01:29.021 --> 01:30.222
cake, decor,

01:30.256 --> 01:31.456
eatin' dat cake...

01:31.489 --> 01:33.425
Angie, he's going
all the way to Z. Stop him.

01:33.459 --> 01:35.561
All right, look,<i> we're</i> not
doing anything, all right?

01:35.593 --> 01:37.062
<i>I'm</i> just gonna order in with Owen.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.064
- Mm-hmm. Interesting.
- Will, no.

01:39.097 --> 01:41.094
I can almost see what's
happening inside your brain.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.468
Little men in hard hats are
clocking in with lunch pails,

01:43.501 --> 01:45.137
all set to work, work, work

01:45.171 --> 01:47.507
until Angie's 30th
is a massive extravaganza.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.275
You know, that's so funny.
That's what I see, too.

01:49.308 --> 01:51.344
Little men in hard hats, like
the Doozers from "Fraggle Rock."

01:51.376 --> 01:53.387
Oh, see, I do little ants in suits,

01:53.412 --> 01:55.013
always checking their watch,
saying it's bug o'clock.

01:55.046 --> 01:57.582
Well, bad news... Angie won't
let you celebrate her birthday.

01:57.615 --> 01:59.352
Trust me. I've spent years trying.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.088
It's not you guys, all right?
I'm just not into my birthday.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.122
And the last time I tried to
plan something was for my 21st.

02:04.156 --> 02:05.291
I was supposed to go to Ozzfest,

02:05.323 --> 02:07.527
and then I ended up
taking tequila shots,

02:07.560 --> 02:08.828
passed out, never made it out the door.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.129
By the time I turned 22, I was pregnant.

02:11.163 --> 02:12.999
Okay. Okay. Now peep this.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.801
We do something big this year
to make up for lost time!

02:15.834 --> 02:17.937
No, it's too late.
My 20s are a lost decade.

02:17.969 --> 02:19.604
A-Aside from Graham.

02:19.638 --> 02:20.806
You know. You... You get it.

02:20.838 --> 02:22.040
Totally. We love our kids.

02:22.074 --> 02:23.176
Love of my life,
my purpose for existing.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.877
Yeah, a heart
outside of our chest. Et cetera.

02:24.909 --> 02:26.846
You know, I guess I <i> am</i> a little
bummed I never got to do

02:26.878 --> 02:29.014
all the quintessential 20s stuff
that normal people do.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.816
Like, I never shot at trophies
with a shotgun

02:30.848 --> 02:32.185
from the back of a pickup truck.

02:32.217 --> 02:34.453
That's "Varsity Blues,"
and it's about high school.

02:34.485 --> 02:36.488
Never did the quintessential thing

02:36.521 --> 02:38.456
where you unexpectedly jump up on stage

02:38.490 --> 02:40.359
at a cathartic moment

02:40.391 --> 02:41.960
and start singing in front of a crowd

02:41.993 --> 02:43.361
with steadily increasing confidence.

02:43.395 --> 02:44.697
Now, I can't tell if you don't know

02:44.729 --> 02:46.064
what people actually do in their 20s

02:46.098 --> 02:48.134
or if you don't know what
the word "quintessential" means.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.534
I was raising a kid.

02:49.568 --> 02:51.537
I-I wasn't gallivanting around

02:51.569 --> 02:53.805
acquiring a whole network
of friends who throw ragers.

02:53.838 --> 02:54.873
I am quite happy

02:54.907 --> 02:56.975
entering my 30s
the way I spent my 20s...

02:57.008 --> 02:59.477
curled up on the couch,
eating takeout Mexican.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.913
And at least this time,
I have a boyfriend.

03:01.947 --> 03:03.883
- And a Netflix account.
- Yes!

03:03.915 --> 03:06.051
Um, it's <i> my</i> Netflix account.
You're borrowing it.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.853
And how are you still
watching "Lilyhammer"?

03:07.885 --> 03:10.656
I love Van Zandt, and I'm done
apologizing for that!

03:10.688 --> 03:11.723
If you'll excuse me,

03:11.757 --> 03:14.193
I'm going to the bathroom
to pee this out.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.895
Okay, so, we're totally
throwing her a party, right?

03:15.927 --> 03:16.929
- What?!
- Come on. We have to.

03:16.961 --> 03:18.197
It's the last night of her 20s.

03:18.229 --> 03:19.231
We can even do it <i> here.</i>

03:19.264 --> 03:21.433
That could be good for business.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.403
Well, I went to go
scope out the competition,

03:24.436 --> 03:25.837
and now I can confirm

03:25.871 --> 03:29.842
that The Karen Club mimosas <i>
are</i> bottomless.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.078
So, the takeaway from this recon
mission is that you're drunk.

03:32.110 --> 03:34.513
- Yeah. I-I was trying to help.
- Miggy, you're very sweet,

03:34.545 --> 03:36.215
but you're bad at helping,
so I hate to do this,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.333
but you have to do
that chant I taught you.

03:38.365 --> 03:40.286
Five, six, seven, eight.

03:40.318 --> 03:42.387
Never, ever help because my instincts

03:42.420 --> 03:44.222
are the leftover water
from a hot dog bag!

03:44.256 --> 03:45.457
That's right.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.213
Hey, Douglas, can I get
your opinion on something?

03:48.238 --> 03:49.463
Hey, uh, y-you know what, kid?

03:49.488 --> 03:50.855
I-I got a lot on my plate today.

03:50.895 --> 03:53.031
I got to get to my car,
I got to unlock the car,

03:53.064 --> 03:54.366
I got to get in the car...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.699
It's about the present
I got for my mom's birthday.

03:56.724 --> 03:57.737
It's a necklace.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.439
Oh, very classy. Sounds like
you're on the right track.

04:00.472 --> 04:03.409
I used a pasta that's small
and structurally sound,

04:03.442 --> 04:04.909
just like my mom.

04:04.943 --> 04:06.445
It's ditalini rigati.

04:06.478 --> 04:08.581
Graham, I-I'm gonna be honest with you.

04:08.614 --> 04:11.250
When we first met, I wasn't a fan.

04:11.282 --> 04:14.119
But then, after a few years,
well, you started to grow on me.

04:14.152 --> 04:16.421
So, out of respect for our bond,

04:16.454 --> 04:18.757
I'm just gonna be straight with you...

04:18.790 --> 04:20.125
your necklace stinks.

04:20.158 --> 04:22.365
But... I made it.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.732
Yeah. I-I can tell. That's the thing.

04:24.757 --> 04:26.005
See, you're a child,

04:26.030 --> 04:27.966
and children are bad at making things.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.101
That's why I come to you, Douglas...

04:30.134 --> 04:31.269
brutal truth.

04:31.302 --> 04:33.105
What do I do?

04:33.137 --> 04:34.472
What do women want?

04:34.505 --> 04:37.475
Women want things
that are bought at a store,

04:37.509 --> 04:38.978
that cost a lot of money.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.112
Oh.

04:40.144 --> 04:41.479
Okay.

04:41.512 --> 04:44.616
Well, I don't have money
or transportation,

04:44.649 --> 04:47.952
so I guess I'm giving the most
important woman in my life

04:47.985 --> 04:50.122
garbage for her 30th birthday.

04:50.154 --> 04:52.357
Okay, look, drop the Willy Loman crap.

04:52.391 --> 04:54.760
After school, I'll take you to the mall.

04:54.793 --> 04:56.461
A-And don't ask to ride shotgun.

04:56.495 --> 04:59.298
That seat's occupied by my dry-cleaning.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.833
Yes!

05:03.869 --> 05:05.004
Okay, I'm just gonna come out with it.

05:05.036 --> 05:08.007
It's another candle,
and this one is <i> unscented,</i>

05:08.040 --> 05:09.875
which... might make it worse

05:09.908 --> 05:11.043
- than my Christmas gifts.
- Mm-hmm.

05:11.076 --> 05:12.878
But I didn't want to let
any more of the day go by

05:12.911 --> 05:14.346
without celebrating your birthday.

05:14.379 --> 05:15.348
Aww.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.715
I love you.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.451
Aww.

05:18.483 --> 05:19.718
You rock.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.987
You know, you never say it back.

05:23.021 --> 05:24.456
Say what?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.225
Um, "I love you."

05:26.257 --> 05:27.492
Really?

05:27.526 --> 05:29.495
I feel like I say it all the time.

05:30.596 --> 05:31.564
I love you.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.997
My man.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.468
I love you.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.336
Damn, dawg, that's sick as fudge!

05:39.904 --> 05:41.206
I love you.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.475
A-very nice!

05:43.509 --> 05:45.677
Wow. I guess you're right.

05:45.711 --> 05:47.413
God, I had no idea.

05:47.446 --> 05:48.713
Should I just say it <i> now?</i>

05:48.747 --> 05:50.750
No. No. That's the only thing
that would make it weirder.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.852
I don't want you to say it until
you're actually feeling it.

05:52.884 --> 05:55.887
In the meantime, you do
a pretty good Borat impression.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.035
Right?!

05:57.059 --> 05:58.388
Don't you think it's time
we brought that back?

05:58.389 --> 05:59.692
You know what else we should bring back?

05:59.717 --> 06:01.408
- Bane impressions.
- Ooh.

06:01.441 --> 06:03.262
It's very fun to say "my wife,"

06:03.295 --> 06:05.230
but with a Bane voice.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.399
My wife.

06:07.598 --> 06:09.567
Thank you for the candle.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.370
I bought it from HomeGoods.

06:11.403 --> 06:13.906
I never want to hear
your real voice again.

06:13.939 --> 06:15.141
Was that good?

06:16.475 --> 06:18.110
How can you all sit here

06:18.142 --> 06:20.078
knowing that there's
a birthday party guest list

06:20.112 --> 06:21.614
currently missing our names?

06:21.646 --> 06:22.698
Because we're kids?

06:22.723 --> 06:25.191
Exactly right. We're kids.
No one takes us seriously.

06:25.216 --> 06:26.951
If we want to attend an adult party,

06:26.985 --> 06:29.254
we can either wait 15 years or...

06:29.288 --> 06:31.290
- Fake I.D.s.
- I'll turn on the printer.

06:31.322 --> 06:33.692
Wrong! We have to show them
that we're sophisticated adults.

06:33.725 --> 06:34.960
Do you know what that means?

06:34.992 --> 06:36.629
He's gonna say he has to write a play.

06:36.661 --> 06:38.129
I have to write a play!

06:38.163 --> 06:40.032
We'll show it to the adults
when they return,

06:40.064 --> 06:41.533
and they'll finally see us as peers.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.735
All right!

06:42.767 --> 06:45.036
Now...

06:45.069 --> 06:46.404
let's hear some ideas.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.613
Really wish I hadn't have thrown my phone.

06:55.646 --> 06:57.916
Wow. Lots of piercings.

06:57.949 --> 07:00.786
Will! This is what you call
a small, tasteful soiree?

07:00.819 --> 07:02.621
Yeah, I got a little carried away.

07:02.653 --> 07:04.389
I'm just trying to re-create
the birthday that Angie missed

07:04.423 --> 07:06.125
- when she was supposed to go to Ozzfest.
- Mm-hmm.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.626
- I booked a goat.
- Oh, did you?

07:07.658 --> 07:09.466
Yeah. And the Hilltop
parent-teacher band.

07:09.491 --> 07:11.987
Fronted by... Mark Rush!

07:12.012 --> 07:13.164
Oh, is that gonna be cool?

07:13.197 --> 07:14.233
Yes. Mark and I are fine.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.835
- He's wearing my blouse.
- Nice.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.101
Devil test one.

07:17.134 --> 07:19.070
Testing for the devil! Blood one, two!

07:19.103 --> 07:20.639
Okay. Think that sounds good.

07:22.841 --> 07:24.276
Oh.

07:24.309 --> 07:26.846
Bess! Lil! Fran! Welcome back.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.480
Uh, can I get you anything? Wine? Books?

07:28.514 --> 07:29.514
Gargoyles?

07:29.548 --> 07:30.783
What the hell's going on in here?

07:30.815 --> 07:32.951
Why is there a person
drinking out of a skull?

07:32.985 --> 07:35.709
I am so sorry. It's my friend
Angie's 30th birthday.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.990
It's fine. We can just
go to The Karen Club.

07:38.023 --> 07:39.458
No, no, no, no! Don't go!

07:39.490 --> 07:42.461
Look, I promise
we'll keep it civil and quiet.

07:42.494 --> 07:44.497
She's here!

07:44.529 --> 07:47.131
Happy birthday!

07:47.165 --> 07:48.367
Oh, my God.

07:48.399 --> 07:50.168
What is this?

07:52.237 --> 07:54.807
'Cause I love it!

07:55.773 --> 07:57.976
Oh, my God! Did you do this?

08:00.345 --> 08:01.480
Uh-huh.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.314
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you did this.

08:03.348 --> 08:05.718
This is the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.387
Well...

08:08.420 --> 08:09.487
you're welcome.

08:11.723 --> 08:13.492
Let's hear it for Owen!

08:13.524 --> 08:14.492
Yeah!

08:14.526 --> 08:16.028
- Owen! Owen!
- Wow!

08:16.060 --> 08:17.328
Owen!

08:17.362 --> 08:18.397
- Owen!
- How'd you do it?!

08:18.430 --> 08:20.141
Owen! Owen!

08:21.844 --> 08:25.304
What's up, Angie's 30th Birthday Party?!

08:25.336 --> 08:26.538
We're The Lefty Desks,

08:26.572 --> 08:28.406
formerly known as Morning Announcements.

08:30.032 --> 08:31.576
Will!

08:31.610 --> 08:32.644
Can you believe this?

08:32.677 --> 08:34.679
I can. Not! I cannot.

08:34.712 --> 08:37.414
Words cannot express
how unbelievable this is.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.183
God, it's amazing.
Can I tell you something?

08:39.216 --> 08:40.634
Owen's been telling me he loves me,

08:40.659 --> 08:42.053
but I haven't been able to say it back,

08:42.086 --> 08:44.056
and I didn't know why,
but I think part of me

08:44.089 --> 08:45.391
was worried that he didn't get me.

08:45.423 --> 08:48.461
Relationships are a spicy meat-a-ball!

08:49.528 --> 08:50.663
Go on.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.764
Look around.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.499
I mean, this is just a-amazing.

08:53.532 --> 08:56.402
I didn't even know
I wanted this party, but <i> he</i> did.

08:56.434 --> 08:58.002
It's like he knows me
better than I know myself.

08:58.035 --> 08:59.437
Yep, that's Owen.

08:59.471 --> 09:01.606
Oh, my God! He got Alice Cooper!

09:01.639 --> 09:03.942
Oh, no. That's actually
just Mark Rush in a wig.

09:03.975 --> 09:06.278
- Oh.
- ♪ You go insane ♪

09:06.311 --> 09:09.281
♪ Speeding through my ♪

09:09.313 --> 09:11.616
♪ Choo choo veins ♪

09:11.649 --> 09:13.351
That's uncanny.

09:13.384 --> 09:15.019
And he also got corn chips!

09:15.052 --> 09:17.689
I <i> love</i> corn chips! Yes!

09:17.722 --> 09:19.190
I know.

09:19.224 --> 09:23.295
- So,<i> this</i> is a department store.
- That's right.

09:23.327 --> 09:25.630
The opportunities
to find a gift for your mom here

09:25.663 --> 09:26.899
are endless.

09:26.932 --> 09:29.268
But, alas, the department store
days are numbered.

09:29.301 --> 09:32.437
It's a beautiful relic,
a-a noble dinosaur.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.273
My favorite is triceratops.

09:34.306 --> 09:35.975
Try to stay with me, Graham.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.942
Dr. Douglas. Welcome back.

09:37.975 --> 09:39.244
Thank you, Cathy.

09:39.277 --> 09:40.446
Hello, Doctor.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.281
Ah, Loraine.

09:42.313 --> 09:43.982
Did you used to work here?

09:44.015 --> 09:45.583
No, no, I'm a dermatologist.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.485
I'm like a celebrity to these people.

09:47.519 --> 09:49.288
U-Uh, Charlene?

09:49.321 --> 09:51.790
Where did we go wrong, huh?

09:51.822 --> 09:55.126
Please, allow me
to buy you something fancy.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.274
- Who's the kid?
- Oh, it's unimportant.

09:57.299 --> 09:58.262
I'm Graham.

09:58.296 --> 09:59.831
We're buying a gift for my mom.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.332
I made her a pasta necklace,

10:01.365 --> 10:03.001
but Douglas told me it was trash.

10:03.034 --> 10:04.135
And he was right.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.437
He's paraphrasing.

10:06.471 --> 10:08.440
You know, I bet
your mom would've loved it.

10:08.472 --> 10:10.608
I mean, not every woman
needs something fancy.

10:10.642 --> 10:13.171
What about you, Charlene? Huh?
What do <i> you</i> need?

10:13.210 --> 10:14.278
Come on. Let's get into it.

10:14.312 --> 10:16.148
- But, Douglas...
- Okay, look, I'll tell you what.

10:16.181 --> 10:18.450
Here's my credit card. Go nuts.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.451
Should we have a meet-up plan
or something?

10:20.485 --> 10:22.821
Yes, look for the 6'8" man
in the makeup section.

10:22.854 --> 10:24.623
Okay? Thank you.

10:24.655 --> 10:25.623
All right.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.328
This may be the three Cabernets talking,

10:30.361 --> 10:31.629
but I hate reading.

10:31.663 --> 10:32.965
You know?

10:32.998 --> 10:35.266
Oof. They don't look happy. Should I...

10:35.299 --> 10:36.709
No. Again, you shouldn't do anything.

10:36.741 --> 10:38.477
What do we know about your instincts?

10:38.503 --> 10:40.139
Leftover water from a hot dog bag.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.141
That's right. You just
keep serving them wine.

10:42.173 --> 10:44.143
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Okay.

10:45.009 --> 10:47.846
Poppy! Douglas took me shopping
for my mom.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.481
I think I nailed it.

10:50.548 --> 10:51.616
Whoa, cowboy.

10:51.649 --> 10:53.485
- Douglas!
- Yeah, what the hell?!

10:53.518 --> 10:54.653
The netting seemed cool,

10:54.686 --> 10:56.488
and I like that there are
feathers on it!

10:56.520 --> 10:58.289
You let him buy lingerie for his mom?!

10:58.322 --> 11:00.158
Of course I didn't let him buy lingerie!

11:00.192 --> 11:02.360
I gave him my credit card
and I sent him off.

11:02.394 --> 11:04.697
So, sorry, D'Amato, but you're
going with the necklace.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.964
I threw it away.

11:05.996 --> 11:08.067
You said it was trash,
so I put it in the trash.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.614
- Hm.
- Never said that.

11:09.639 --> 11:11.703
Well, looks like
you're going dumpster diving.

11:11.736 --> 11:12.637
Ow!

11:12.671 --> 11:14.307
Oh, God. The goat's in the wine!

11:14.332 --> 11:16.207
Get the goat out of the wine!

11:19.410 --> 11:20.845
Hey, what's up, man?

11:20.879 --> 11:22.047
Hey.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.982
Hey, so, listen,
I just wanted to apologize,

11:24.014 --> 11:26.250
'cause I know you planned
this entire thing,

11:26.283 --> 11:28.086
and it is insane
that I took credit for it.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.322
I think I might be a sociopath.
I already texted my therapist.

11:30.355 --> 11:32.024
Listen, tonight is not about me, so...

11:32.057 --> 11:33.158
No, no, no. No. I know.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.694
But I really am sorry, and...

11:35.726 --> 11:37.106
I'm gonna tell Angie the truth.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.294
Although I did throw
a pretty awesome party.

11:41.359 --> 11:42.427
Wait. No,<i> you</i> threw the party.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.601
Man, I really committed to this lie.

11:43.634 --> 11:44.870
I gotta come clean.

11:44.903 --> 11:46.772
Chips, chips, chips, chips, chips!

11:46.804 --> 11:48.106
No, no, you don't.

11:48.139 --> 11:50.074
I mean, she's having such a good time.

11:50.107 --> 11:51.342
So, how about this...

11:51.375 --> 11:53.044
I'll fill you in on the plans
for the rest of the night

11:53.077 --> 11:54.446
so that you can act
like you came up with it.

11:54.479 --> 11:57.007
Now, in 10 minutes, we're gonna
be handing out gummy snakes

11:57.032 --> 11:58.583
so that people
can bite the head off of them

11:58.616 --> 12:00.118
like Ozzy Osbourne did that one time,

12:00.152 --> 12:02.387
and then in an hour,
we're bringing out the cake.

12:02.419 --> 12:03.788
It's shaped like a bat heart.

12:03.822 --> 12:04.956
W-What's a bat heart look like?

12:04.990 --> 12:07.091
Kind of like a regular heart,
but smaller,

12:07.125 --> 12:08.594
but actually bigger,
'cause this is a cake.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.596
- Got it.
- And then, at the end of the night,

12:10.629 --> 12:13.132
the band is gonna serenade Angie
with her favorite song.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.567
- "Blue (Da Ba Dee)"?
- No.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.436
That Eric Clapton song about cocaine?

12:17.469 --> 12:18.604
- You mean "Cocaine"?
- Yeah.

12:18.636 --> 12:20.905
No. "Raining Blood" by Slayer.

12:20.938 --> 12:22.540
Man! How do you know all this stuff?

12:22.573 --> 12:24.543
It's fine. You're gonna do great.

12:24.576 --> 12:25.543
Wow.

12:25.576 --> 12:26.846
You really went for it.

12:28.078 --> 12:29.914
No, man.<i> You</i> really went for it.

12:32.650 --> 12:34.225
Okay, last pitch.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.953
We call it "I Object:

12:35.986 --> 12:38.289
A Woman's Journey Through Law:
The D'Amato Story,"

12:38.322 --> 12:41.393
an inspiring tale of a paralegal
in a man's world.

12:41.426 --> 12:42.961
I guess I don't have to like

12:42.994 --> 12:44.463
every play that has my name on it.

12:44.495 --> 12:46.733
We've been pitching you ideas
for an hour.

12:46.758 --> 12:48.466
You haven't pitched <i> any!</i>

12:48.500 --> 12:51.336
My idea was the idea to do something!
Now clear a space!

12:55.841 --> 12:57.643
1989.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.946
We hear the heartbeat,
crack of a baby's first cry,

13:00.979 --> 13:03.682
jump to her first kiss,
flash forward to her law firm,

13:03.715 --> 13:05.617
intermission, meet Graham,
meet future Graham,

13:05.649 --> 13:07.185
flashback to monologue from the womb,

13:07.219 --> 13:08.787
and... curtain!

13:08.820 --> 13:10.823
Roses, roses, roses,<i>
New York Times</i> goes crazy.

13:10.855 --> 13:12.157
Okay, so, what do you think?

13:12.190 --> 13:13.824
Huh?

13:13.825 --> 13:15.294
Fine! I'll just do it myself!

13:19.029 --> 13:21.365
Hey. I just tried
the specialty cocktail.

13:21.399 --> 13:24.602
Tomato D'Amato?
A Bloody Mary with tequila?

13:24.635 --> 13:26.137
Genius!

13:26.171 --> 13:27.973
How did you think of it?

13:28.005 --> 13:29.374
Just... sort of came to me.

13:31.076 --> 13:33.644
Actually, um...

13:33.677 --> 13:35.313
I can't keep taking credit.

13:35.346 --> 13:36.347
No, don't be humble.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.983
This party you threw is incredible.

13:40.018 --> 13:41.186
And I just want to say...

13:41.219 --> 13:42.655
Oh, God.

13:43.754 --> 13:44.990
...I love you.

13:46.323 --> 13:47.458
We have to break up.

13:47.491 --> 13:49.160
What?

13:49.185 --> 13:50.694
Let's hear it for Angie and Owen!

13:50.719 --> 13:51.797
Yeah!

13:51.830 --> 13:52.865
Get a room, you two!

13:54.899 --> 13:55.867
Whoo!

14:00.751 --> 14:03.642
You're breaking up with me?
At my birthday party?

14:03.674 --> 14:04.642
That you planned?

14:04.676 --> 14:05.811
I didn't plan the party.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.179
- What?
- Look, I'm sorry.

14:07.211 --> 14:09.181
I-I just sort of panicked
and took credit.

14:09.214 --> 14:10.716
You looked so happy,

14:10.749 --> 14:12.918
and I wanted to be the one
that made you feel that way.

14:12.951 --> 14:14.485
You <i> do</i> make me happy.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.153
Yeah, but there's something missing.

14:16.187 --> 14:18.490
That's why you couldn't say
"I love you."

14:18.523 --> 14:20.692
And then when you did, it was for
something that I didn't even do.

14:20.725 --> 14:22.927
I <i> did</i> say it, though.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.496
Yeah, but do you?

14:25.529 --> 14:26.530
Love me?

14:30.467 --> 14:31.769
I don't know.

14:36.740 --> 14:37.875
I'm sorry.

14:41.312 --> 14:42.581
Okay.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.216
I should probably go.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.074

15:05.803 --> 15:08.307
Hey, Rory. Are you okay?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.474
No! I'm blocked!

15:09.506 --> 15:11.075
The only thing
that I've done on that computer

15:11.109 --> 15:12.878
is find the right level of zoom
for my eyes.

15:12.910 --> 15:15.146
What's worse is, I feel
like I've let you all down.

15:15.179 --> 15:17.114
I know you guys see me as a leader...

15:17.148 --> 15:18.450
the wise one,

15:18.482 --> 15:20.284
nothing less than a god.

15:20.317 --> 15:21.319
We said that?

15:21.344 --> 15:22.560
No, but just nod.

15:22.585 --> 15:24.956
And I can't get this play done,

15:24.990 --> 15:27.960
which means they had a right
not to invite us to the party.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.828
Let's face it... I'm a kid.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.330
Is that so bad?

15:31.363 --> 15:33.165
<i>We're</i> kids, and we wrote a play.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.000
There's even a part for <i> you.</i>

15:35.033 --> 15:38.135
Welcome to our Emma, Amy, Sophie,

15:38.168 --> 15:39.971
<i>and</i> Rory Banks Production.

15:40.004 --> 15:41.974
Hmm. How big is my role?

15:42.006 --> 15:43.007
You play Graham.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.643
The son, huh?

15:44.676 --> 15:46.011
Let me talk to my agent.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.579
A-she said yes!

15:49.813 --> 15:51.012
Ladies.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.184
So sorry I haven't checked in on you.

15:53.217 --> 15:54.551
So, what are we talking about?

15:54.576 --> 15:56.488
Everyone, the bell has rung!

15:56.520 --> 15:58.990
It's time for another rock exam!

15:59.024 --> 16:01.371
That's it! We are going to The Karen Club.

16:01.396 --> 16:03.028
W-W-W-Wait. N...

16:03.061 --> 16:04.363
Great. We lost them!

16:04.395 --> 16:06.163
Wait. Let me try something.
Give me a chance, okay?

16:06.197 --> 16:07.666
Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies. Hey, hey.

16:07.698 --> 16:09.867
Are you mad that
the heavy metal is ruining

16:09.900 --> 16:12.336
your weird book club-type thing
or whatever this is?

16:12.370 --> 16:13.403
Yeah!

16:13.404 --> 16:14.472
Yeah, but that's not all, is it?

16:14.505 --> 16:15.940
What else is making you mad?

16:15.974 --> 16:16.975
- Pay gap!
- Childcare!

16:17.008 --> 16:18.310
That one part in "Becoming"

16:18.342 --> 16:19.441
where Michelle Obama says

16:19.466 --> 16:21.712
a U.S. sitting congressman
made fun of her butt!

16:21.745 --> 16:23.948
Ladies, you don't need The Karen Club.

16:23.981 --> 16:26.814
I think you need... to rage!

16:26.839 --> 16:29.553
- Yeah!
- Rock out that anger... now!

16:29.586 --> 16:31.188
- Come on! Yeah!
- Yeah!

16:31.221 --> 16:32.189
- Let's do this!
- Go!

16:32.222 --> 16:33.657
Okay!

16:33.691 --> 16:34.960
Yeah!

16:34.993 --> 16:36.461
I cannot believe that worked.

16:36.494 --> 16:37.461
Me neither.

16:37.495 --> 16:38.797
Yeaaah!

16:38.830 --> 16:40.298
Hey, birthday girl.

16:40.331 --> 16:41.966
Owen and I broke up.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.034
What? Why?

16:43.067 --> 16:44.870
He told me he didn't throw this party.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.038
Obviously,<i> you</i> did...

16:46.071 --> 16:47.706
which I should've known.

16:47.739 --> 16:50.341
Thank you for my party.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.576
You're welcome.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.681
I-I think I just wanted him
to know me that well.

16:58.515 --> 16:59.517
I'm really sorry.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.186
Yeah. Me too.

17:01.219 --> 17:03.389
I just wanted you to have a good 30th.

17:04.756 --> 17:06.992
You know, in spite of all of it,

17:07.025 --> 17:08.492
I... think I did.

17:08.526 --> 17:10.162
Mm.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.364
Well, it's probably
the power of Ozzfest, right?

17:12.396 --> 17:14.932
♪ The concrete cauldron
can't refuse me ♪

17:14.964 --> 17:17.535
It's got to be the music.
Really gets inside of you.

17:17.568 --> 17:18.769
Yeah, I know <i> I'm</i> changed.

17:18.803 --> 17:20.038
You hate this music.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.038
I don't love it.

17:21.070 --> 17:22.573
There was 20 minutes where I thought

17:22.606 --> 17:23.840
I was kind of connecting with it,

17:23.875 --> 17:26.111
and then I realized the band
was actually taking a break

17:26.144 --> 17:27.913
and I was just listening
to a Hall & Oates CD.

17:27.944 --> 17:29.780
Thank you!

17:29.814 --> 17:31.234
All right, we're gonna change tuning,

17:31.258 --> 17:32.616
and we'll be right back.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.086
I'm sorry that you're
starting your 30s single.

17:35.119 --> 17:36.554
No. You know what?

17:36.587 --> 17:38.423
I spent my 20s single,
taking care of Graham,

17:38.455 --> 17:40.692
and I still managed to end up
with a group of friends

17:40.724 --> 17:42.726
who love me enough to do this for me.

17:42.759 --> 17:44.261
Technically, did a lot myself, but...

17:44.295 --> 17:47.231
If anything, this birthday
should be a celebration of <i> that.</i>

17:47.265 --> 17:49.467
- Hear, hear.
- Mom?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.569
- Hi, sweetie.
- Here's your gift.

17:51.595 --> 17:53.130
I made it, and I know it's terrible

17:53.171 --> 17:55.050
and covered in trash.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.909
- I'm sorry.
- No, this is so good.

17:57.942 --> 18:00.278
Graham, what on Earth would
make you think this is bad?

18:00.310 --> 18:02.480
Douglas told me so.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.650
Oh, don't look at me surprised.
You know who I am.

18:06.683 --> 18:07.652
It's okay.

18:07.684 --> 18:09.120
You're going to put it in a box

18:09.153 --> 18:11.789
with the seashell earrings
I gave you that you never wore.

18:11.823 --> 18:14.792
Look, sweetie.

18:14.826 --> 18:17.162
I don't always wear the things you make,

18:17.194 --> 18:19.130
but I do love them.

18:19.163 --> 18:21.665
And they're not bad
because you made them.

18:21.699 --> 18:24.469
They're <i> amazing</i> because you made them.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.437
That's really nice, Mom.

18:26.471 --> 18:28.472
But I still want to get you something

18:28.506 --> 18:30.575
that you'll actually wear.

18:30.607 --> 18:33.511
We just need to exchange
the lingerie I bought you.

18:34.274 --> 18:35.312
What?

18:37.648 --> 18:39.450
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

18:40.817 --> 18:43.288
- Channeling their rage was a great idea.
- Word.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.823
Miggy, I can't believe I'm about to
say this, but you really helped.

18:45.856 --> 18:46.946
- Word?!
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.971 --> 18:48.793
- Thank you!
- What is that on your wrist?

18:48.826 --> 18:50.127
Oh, it's a Karen Club scrunchie.

18:50.161 --> 18:52.029
- Oh, it's a Karen Club scrunchie.
- It is, yeah.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.265
- Oh, okay.
- Wha...

18:53.298 --> 18:55.267
All right, we got
one more song for you tonight,

18:55.299 --> 18:57.168
and it goes out to the birthday girl.

18:57.201 --> 18:58.502
Hey, she's a <i> woman!</i>

18:58.536 --> 18:59.971
- Don't diminish her!
- She's your equal!

19:00.003 --> 19:02.491
All right, one, two, three, four!

19:04.241 --> 19:05.442
This is my favorite song!

19:05.476 --> 19:07.012
I know.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.380
Wait. What time were you born?

19:08.413 --> 19:10.281
10:30. Why?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.317
You're technically still in your 20s,

19:12.349 --> 19:13.885
so there's still time to...

19:14.986 --> 19:16.955
You know, do that thing

19:16.988 --> 19:19.191
where you go on stage
during a cathartic moment

19:19.223 --> 19:21.292
and sing in front of a group of people

19:21.333 --> 19:23.000
- with steadily increasing confidence.
- No.

19:23.027 --> 19:23.961
- No!
- Do it!

19:23.994 --> 19:25.054
- No way!
- Do it!

19:25.079 --> 19:26.130
I'm not going up there! No!

19:26.163 --> 19:29.233
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

19:29.267 --> 19:33.004
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

19:38.710 --> 19:41.680
I can't imagine this isn't
gonna become embarrassing.

That's right.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.277
That happened.

20:45.309 --> 20:47.078
Now can we please just move past it?

Happy birthday, Mom.
