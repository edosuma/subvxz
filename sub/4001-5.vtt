THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE...

53:55.250 --> 53:57.166
...INCLUDING HARRY.

53:57.166 --> 53:58.959
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

53:58.959 --> 54:02.083
AM I THE TWISTED
BAY HARBOR BUTCHER...

54:02.083 --> 54:05.125
OR THE VALIANT DARK DEFENDER?

54:05.125 --> 54:07.166
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

54:07.166 --> 54:12.375
FUNNY THING IS I'VE MET SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T CARE WHAT I AM.

54:12.375 --> 54:15.417
I SUPPOSE EVERY HERO
NEEDS A SIDEKICK...

54:15.417 --> 54:18.250
EVERY VILLAIN,
A PARTNER IN CRIME.

54:20.750 --> 54:25.917
ALL MY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN
BUILT ON NOT KNOWING.

54:25.917 --> 54:28.125
BUT THAT MAY BE CHANGING.

54:31.583 --> 54:37.375
IMAGINE THAT --
A LIFE WITH NO MORE SECRETS.

54:58.417 --> 55:06.291
