01:21.200 --> 01:23.564
- Good morning, boys, it's Lloyd.
- Morning, Lloyd.

01:23.672 --> 01:26.423
I don't think Vince is up yet,
but we're still on for Ari, right?

01:26.536 --> 01:28.011
Absolutely,
he'll meet you at noon.

01:28.113 --> 01:31.010
And sorry to bother you, E,
but I'm actually calling for Johnny.

01:32.122 --> 01:33.916
It looks like you're
gonna have to get used

01:34.010 --> 01:36.099
to two superstars
living in the house now.

01:36.663 --> 01:37.730
All right, later.

01:37.946 --> 01:40.575
- What's up, Lloyd?
- All good things, Johnny.

01:40.951 --> 01:43.156
Brett Ratner
saw your new tv show

01:43.250 --> 01:45.914
and he wants to offer you a part
in his new movie.

01:46.138 --> 01:48.537
An offer? No audition?
You're kidding.

01:48.761 --> 01:50.349
I'm not kidding!
Sound good?

01:50.701 --> 01:52.992
Sounds amazing.
Thanks, Lloyd.

01:57.663 --> 02:00.189
<i>Rush Hour 3, Johnny?
That is sweet.</i>

02:00.469 --> 02:01.671
Yeah, could be.

02:01.802 --> 02:03.896
Brett wants me
to come up to casa del ratner

02:04.009 --> 02:06.432
- to discuss the role.
- Nice, Drama. What is it?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.949
I don't know,
but I'm gonna tell him straight up,

02:09.061 --> 02:11.202
it better be something
I can sink my teeth into

02:11.416 --> 02:13.885
'cause Johnny Drama
don't shine shoes no more.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.207
Oh, someone's
getting a little cocky.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.268
No cockiness here, Turtle,

02:18.386 --> 02:21.182
just the confidence that gainful
employment can give a man.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.215
Amazing Turtle's been able to stay
confident this long without a job!

02:24.795 --> 02:27.405
I knew my life would suck
if Drama got a career before I did.

02:27.518 --> 02:30.241
Maybe your life wouldn't suck
so much if you called that girl Kelly.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.125
I did call her.
What are you talking about?

02:32.228 --> 02:34.533
I'm seeing her today.
She's got the house all to herself.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.061
- And you didn't tell us?
- You're trying to play it cool?

02:37.206 --> 02:39.957
Well, unlike him, I don't like
to brag about my accomplishments.

02:40.398 --> 02:42.292
You know what?
Speaking of which, Johnny,

02:42.824 --> 02:45.463
you may not wanna do
too much bragging at your day job.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.245
People tend to get jealous.

02:48.199 --> 02:50.884
Good tip, bro.
Tv people are so bitter.

02:51.391 --> 02:53.175
- I'm out!
- Hey, congrats!

02:53.886 --> 02:56.460
So now everyone has so much excitement,
what are we gonna do?

02:56.576 --> 02:59.135
<i>Ari's got a money guy who says
he's dying to fund Medellin.</i>

02:59.204 --> 03:00.706
- Do you believe him?
- Do I ever?

03:06.977 --> 03:08.649
So what, this guy's a prince, Ari?

03:08.748 --> 03:11.208
A prince, an arms dealer,
a coke dealer, who knows?

03:11.298 --> 03:15.021
What I do know is that 60 million to him
is like lunch at the Ivy to you and me.

03:15.226 --> 03:16.865
That's me and Vince,
not you and me, E.

03:16.981 --> 03:19.028
- Jesus.
- It's impressive, huh?

03:19.479 --> 03:20.742
Is that the Mrs. Prince?

03:21.025 --> 03:23.625
Nika Marx...
Ex-Ukrainian soap star.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.691
I think she's the brains
of the operation.

03:28.828 --> 03:30.896
Nika, how are you?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.078
How do I look?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.105
You know vinny Chase?
My boy.

03:35.766 --> 03:38.004
- Big fan.
- Thank you. It's very nice to meet you.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.836
- My wife nika.
- Big fan as well.

03:39.911 --> 03:40.990
Thanks.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.784
Oh, Vinny's manager,
Eric Murphy.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.430
You have very tiny hands.

03:49.904 --> 03:52.890
Come come, I prepared a feast
on the veranda, huh?

03:58.077 --> 03:59.741
Just imagine the one sheet...

03:59.901 --> 04:02.882
My face sandwiched
between Tucker and Chan.

04:03.151 --> 04:05.097
<i>Like Joe Pesci in Lethal 3?</i>

04:05.589 --> 04:07.158
Only a whole lot pretier.

04:08.609 --> 04:10.732
Damn, that is so cool, Drama.

04:10.966 --> 04:13.527
<i>You know, Rush Hour was the
first Jackie Chan movie I ever saw.</i>

04:13.589 --> 04:14.901
Since then I've seen them all.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.653
And Chris Tucker?
Man, I'd kill to be in that movie.

04:17.815 --> 04:21.491
Yeah, who wouldn't, bro? I waited
a long time for an op like this.

04:22.402 --> 04:25.559
Take it from me, Tommy...
you pay your dues, keep the faith,

04:26.243 --> 04:27.652
maybe your day will come also.

04:28.904 --> 04:29.904
You think?

04:30.402 --> 04:33.723
Who knows? The truth is
this business is a fucking crap shoot.

04:34.181 --> 04:37.430
Hey, everybody, got some bad news...
network brass is running late.

04:37.591 --> 04:39.591
- How late?
- It could be a few hours.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.063
But, J.J.,
I've got my thing.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.900
- What thing?
- You know, my thing.

04:44.213 --> 04:48.074
Oh, right, you've got your big
fuck-my-tv-show- I've-got-a-movie-offer-

04:48.252 --> 04:50.515
I- gotta-sit-down-
with-the-hotshot- director thing.

04:50.965 --> 04:52.333
Too bad you gotta miss it.

04:55.339 --> 04:56.656
Aw, just kidding!

04:59.282 --> 05:02.045
Hey, we're all thrilled for you, Drama.
Congrats.

05:02.191 --> 05:03.534
You didn't have to do that.

05:03.652 --> 05:06.347
Don't get too cozy with your
new friends, we've got a night shoot.

05:06.465 --> 05:09.432
Don't worry, J.J. I'll be there.
I'm not gonna pull a Clooney...

05:10.401 --> 05:11.401
Not yet.

05:25.862 --> 05:27.432
So, nobody's home?

05:30.488 --> 05:31.767
Oh, shit.

05:34.426 --> 05:36.568
I thought you guys
were going to the aquarium.

05:36.739 --> 05:40.257
We got kicked out, baby. Your brothers
threw a snow cone at a sea otter.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.115
- Who's the white boy, Kelly?
- Yeah, Kelly?

05:43.673 --> 05:44.725
Who's the white boy?

05:45.052 --> 05:46.963
Shut the hell up
and get in the house.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.409
You're in enough trouble already.

05:52.488 --> 05:53.707
What's going on here?

05:54.175 --> 05:56.154
- Nothing.
- We were just gonna hang out.

06:00.302 --> 06:01.356
So let's hang out.

06:03.665 --> 06:04.761
What do you think,

06:04.958 --> 06:07.784
of Sylvester Stallone
as Pablo Escobar's father, huh?

06:08.647 --> 06:11.306
Why are you laughing?
What do you guys think, huh?

06:11.612 --> 06:14.191
<i>If he survives Rocky 6
without brain damage,</i>

06:14.247 --> 06:15.355
it's something to consider.

06:15.427 --> 06:17.520
Sylvester Stallone
just doesn't feel right, Yair.

06:17.924 --> 06:20.368
- But he sells foreign.
- And if he does it shirtless,

06:20.471 --> 06:23.447
just imagine how many women
will come to see this movie.

06:23.729 --> 06:25.006
She's making fun of me.

06:25.738 --> 06:27.916
Hey, but did Ari explain to you
how I make my money?

06:28.050 --> 06:29.576
- Oh, no.
- May I please speak?

06:30.924 --> 06:34.029
I make my money abroad,
the states are just a bonus for me.

06:34.299 --> 06:36.122
And you...
You may laugh at Sly Stallone,

06:36.239 --> 06:38.186
but in France
he makes me $5 million.

06:38.408 --> 06:39.667
How much does Vince make you?

06:40.070 --> 06:41.141
Not much.

06:41.892 --> 06:44.056
Hey, unless you are
in your aquaman suit...

06:44.122 --> 06:45.380
you know, flippity floppity...

06:45.493 --> 06:47.423
the rest of the world
does not really know you.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.440
- The world will know soon enough.
- They will,

06:49.487 --> 06:52.150
- if we make this movie right.
- We wanna make it right.

06:52.341 --> 06:54.726
Boom, let's call the lawyers
and get the ink flowing.

06:55.612 --> 06:56.645
Settle down, Ari.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.470
Do you understand my position?

07:00.424 --> 07:03.226
Yes, I do,
but just so you understand ours,

07:03.675 --> 07:06.354
we bought this project
so we can make it the way we see it.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.061
So you're saying no to Stallone?

07:10.238 --> 07:12.936
No, he's not saying no.
He... You know, we're just talking.

07:13.086 --> 07:14.535
Actually, I am saying no, Ari...

07:15.615 --> 07:16.878
Respectfully, of course.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.705
I love your commitment
to your vision, Vincent,

07:22.927 --> 07:24.883
and I say no to my husband quite often.

07:25.482 --> 07:28.554
We will find a way to make this movie
and we will make it right.

07:29.262 --> 07:30.371
We shall see, huh?

07:30.987 --> 07:32.970
Until then,
cheers, huh?

07:33.051 --> 07:34.049
Perfect.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.006
Hello, ladies...
Johnny Chase,

07:55.104 --> 07:57.009
<i>official cast member,
Rush Hour 3.</i>

07:57.149 --> 07:58.163
Nice.

08:06.036 --> 08:08.665
Oh, Brett, I can get used to this.

08:10.299 --> 08:12.634
Hi, I'm Mr. Ratner's assistant.
Can I help you?

08:12.906 --> 08:14.546
Johnny Chase, here to see Brett.

08:14.987 --> 08:16.934
<i>Yes, Mr. Chase
from The Five Towns.</i>

08:17.077 --> 08:19.441
Brett's excited to meet you.
He's finishing a photo shoot.

08:19.486 --> 08:21.322
Let me tell him you're here, okay?
Hey, Lana?

08:21.411 --> 08:23.120
Please give Mr. Chase a neck massage

08:23.195 --> 08:24.754
- and get him a drink.
- Sure.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.930
Tell Brett Johnny Chase has arrived.

08:27.877 --> 08:29.144
In more ways than one.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.923
Marissa, you have the best ass in
the world. Stick it out a little, great.

08:32.953 --> 08:35.525
Excellent.
Put your leg up on the motorcycle.

08:35.739 --> 08:36.943
Love it. I got it.

08:36.986 --> 08:39.684
- Johnny Chase is here.
- Where is he? Do me a favor.

08:39.798 --> 08:41.556
Why are there
krispy kreme doughnuts here?

08:41.602 --> 08:43.678
These are supermodels,
not teamsters. Where is he?

08:43.740 --> 08:45.446
He's the guy right there,
getting a drink.

08:45.503 --> 08:46.535
That's not him.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.490
- It isn't?
- Are you a fucking idiot?

08:48.615 --> 08:50.663
That's not him.
Give me the camera.

08:53.805 --> 08:54.928
<i>Good one, Lindsey.</i>

08:56.113 --> 08:58.301
<i>Very funny. Open up.</i>

08:58.452 --> 08:59.503
<i>I knew you were lying.</i>

08:59.607 --> 09:01.428
- Yeah. "we're just friends. "
- Yeah, right.

09:01.503 --> 09:03.295
You're just using us
to suck up to our mom.

09:03.331 --> 09:04.477
- What?
- Yeah,

09:04.599 --> 09:06.580
you're just a dirty, horny sex man

09:06.708 --> 09:08.755
- like all the others.
- Nasty man.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.425
Okay, he's out.

09:12.186 --> 09:13.763
You kids got yourselves an hour or so.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.195
- Go have some fun.
- You sure?

09:16.426 --> 09:17.518
Should I not be?

09:18.140 --> 09:21.060
Come on, Turtle, before
you put your foot in your mouth.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.445
Thank you so much.

09:24.678 --> 09:26.548
A simple thank you
is all I'm looking for...

09:26.611 --> 09:29.481
Russian, Hebrew, Farsi, I don't care.
Anything'll suffice.

09:29.514 --> 09:31.448
Thank you for what?
He said he'd think about it.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.383
That meant he's not gonna let his
wife make him look like a little bitch.

09:34.401 --> 09:35.584
He's in, trust me.

09:35.650 --> 09:36.711
What do you think, Vin?

09:37.265 --> 09:38.771
I think the wife freaked me out.

09:39.391 --> 09:40.593
She was a little cold, no?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.480
A little warm actually.

09:43.862 --> 09:45.125
What do you mean, Vinny?

09:45.391 --> 09:47.298
Did you not see the way
she was looking at me?

09:47.299 --> 09:49.118
Looking at you?
She was wearing sunglasses.

09:49.212 --> 09:51.848
Still looking. Believe me...
it was very uncomfortable.

09:51.935 --> 09:53.410
He thinks everyone wants to fuck him.

09:53.466 --> 09:56.234
Everyone does, no? Although
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:56.355 --> 09:57.369
Me either.

09:57.669 --> 10:00.466
Nobody would be happier than me
if you two were right... trust me.

10:01.362 --> 10:04.420
I don't understand. It's like
you're speaking in a foreign tongue.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.366
They misread the credits.
It was a simple mistake.

10:07.421 --> 10:09.553
- These things happen.
- Not to me, not anymore.

10:09.674 --> 10:12.297
<i>- I'm on a hit tv show now.
- Johnny, don't get crazy.</i>

10:12.535 --> 10:14.613
They said the part is for a 17-year-old.

10:14.695 --> 10:17.139
They meant to offer it
to your little brother on the show.

10:18.378 --> 10:20.214
<i>Tommy's gonna be
in Rush Hour 3 and I'm not?</i>

10:20.985 --> 10:22.150
Jesus Christ.

10:22.253 --> 10:23.886
Be happy for him, Drama... Karma.

10:23.984 --> 10:26.496
- Fuck Karma, I don't need Karma.
- What do you need, Johnny?

10:26.609 --> 10:28.252
<i>I need to be in Rush Hour 3.</i>

10:32.055 --> 10:34.036
Okay, sweetie, I'm ready to press on.

10:37.927 --> 10:40.164
- Excuse me, Mr. Chase.
- Yes?

10:40.362 --> 10:42.768
- Was that your agent?
- It was.

10:43.051 --> 10:44.497
He told you about the mistake?

10:45.051 --> 10:46.556
- He did.
- So...

10:47.758 --> 10:49.073
Why are you still here?

10:49.425 --> 10:51.080
Because I didn't make the mistake.

10:51.739 --> 10:53.640
No, Mr. Chase, you didn't. I did.

10:53.739 --> 10:55.245
I screwed up and misread the credits.

10:55.362 --> 10:56.638
I'm terribly sorry.

10:58.677 --> 11:00.583
Well, sorry ain't gonna cut it, pal.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.963
Let me tell you
something my father told me...

11:04.289 --> 11:06.233
"The best thing to do with mistakes

11:06.615 --> 11:07.777
is to not make them."

11:08.553 --> 11:10.816
but since you did,
the least you can is fix it.

11:11.196 --> 11:13.008
How would you like me to fix it?

11:13.099 --> 11:15.146
<i>- Find me a part in Rush Hour 3.
- Mr. Chase, I...</i>

11:15.183 --> 11:17.625
You can tell Brett
or whoever your skipper is

11:18.050 --> 11:19.893
that I'm not leaving here until you do.

11:32.739 --> 11:34.054
Check, please.
Thank you.

11:35.115 --> 11:38.062
- Turtle, I'm still eating.
- It's been an hour already.

11:38.424 --> 11:39.860
Please stop worrying about my dad.

11:39.971 --> 11:42.071
His bark is worse
than his bite, trust me.

11:42.362 --> 11:43.938
Besides, he'd only really be mad

11:43.978 --> 11:46.675
if he thought you were trying
to get into his little girl's pants.

11:46.761 --> 11:48.826
And that's not
what you're trying to do, right?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.442
Of course not,
you're wearing a skirt.

11:51.987 --> 11:54.593
Just so you know,
it's gonna take a long time

11:54.677 --> 11:56.104
to get into whatever I'm wearing.

11:56.986 --> 11:58.038
You have to earn it.

11:59.615 --> 12:00.615
How?

12:00.987 --> 12:03.303
You can start by taking off your hat.

12:09.909 --> 12:11.139
I must really like you.

12:13.902 --> 12:15.254
You have hat head.

12:15.783 --> 12:18.215
- That's great.
- No, it's cute.

12:19.737 --> 12:20.864
Really?

12:21.456 --> 12:22.470
Really.

12:26.828 --> 12:28.735
This is just like when you
thought Mrs. Rodrigo

12:28.736 --> 12:31.325
- wanted to fuck you in 10th grade.
- Yes, it's exactly like that

12:31.409 --> 12:33.935
- because you thought she didn't.
- Did you fuck Mrs. Rodrigo?

12:34.050 --> 12:36.313
Hand jobs
in the Spanish lab every Tuesday.

12:36.487 --> 12:37.697
You never told me that.

12:38.114 --> 12:39.903
I'm very quiet about these things.

12:40.613 --> 12:42.985
- What, are you jealous?
- A little... she was hot.

12:43.154 --> 12:46.196
Still is... She calls me every
once in a while for phone sex.

12:48.239 --> 12:51.347
Look at this... Nika Marx
calling my cell phone and not yours.

12:51.488 --> 12:52.696
She doesn't have my number.

12:53.081 --> 12:54.414
What? I saw you give it to her.

12:54.488 --> 12:56.756
No, I gave her the one-digit-off move.

12:57.175 --> 12:58.220
That's a girl move.

12:58.304 --> 13:00.381
It's the whoever's-being-
treated-like-meat move.

13:01.488 --> 13:02.502
Eric, it's Nika.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.178
<i>- Hey, how are you?
- Is Vince there?</i>

13:04.363 --> 13:07.233
I have some excellent news and
I'd like to tell it to him personally.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.362
Sure, hold on.

13:09.239 --> 13:10.497
She wants to talk to you.

13:10.675 --> 13:11.990
She's got excellent news.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.371
Take it.

13:16.298 --> 13:17.486
Hello, Mika, how are you?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.466
I apologize for calling your partner,

13:19.551 --> 13:21.908
but I somehow
took your number down incorrectly.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.424
No worries... I never
answer my phone, anyway.

13:24.551 --> 13:26.445
We want to make this movie, Vincent.

13:26.986 --> 13:27.986
Fantastic.

13:28.352 --> 13:29.543
Does that excite you?

13:29.678 --> 13:32.047
Yes, it does, very much so.
They're in.

13:32.392 --> 13:33.679
I just have one small concern...

13:33.773 --> 13:35.300
Creatively. I'd like you to meet me

13:35.301 --> 13:37.862
at the Beverly Wilshire hotel
in an hour and we'll discuss.

13:37.952 --> 13:39.501
<i>- is this okay?
- sure.</i>

13:39.863 --> 13:41.742
One more thing, Vincent...

13:42.211 --> 13:43.338
Yes, Nika?

13:44.614 --> 13:45.614
Come alone.

13:51.572 --> 13:53.872
Don't look now, honey,
but you're about to get gammoned.

13:53.989 --> 13:55.255
Bring it on, tv star.

13:56.506 --> 13:59.426
Low blow.
But not a tv star after today...

13:59.924 --> 14:00.942
Hopefully.

14:01.121 --> 14:02.445
Can I have a word with you a sec?

14:02.575 --> 14:05.426
Hey, Brett. Excuse me, ladies.
The big guy needs a word.

14:06.621 --> 14:08.630
Brett, there was an extra
suit in the pool house.

14:08.738 --> 14:11.442
- I hope you don't mind.
- My assistant said you won't leave.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.468
Why would I wanna leave
a paradise like this?

14:14.615 --> 14:17.550
Such a beautiful home you have...
and so tastefully done, Brett.

14:17.631 --> 14:20.175
- Really, a class look you've got...
- What's wrong with you?

14:20.251 --> 14:21.632
Are you retarded or something?

14:22.927 --> 14:24.672
Just following in your footsteps, Brett.

14:24.802 --> 14:26.122
- My footsteps?
- Yup.

14:27.489 --> 14:29.594
You talked your way
into NYU film school

14:29.674 --> 14:31.246
at 16 with a C average,

14:31.342 --> 14:34.785
you got Spielberg to give you cash
to direct your first student film.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.778
You're a man
who won't take no for an answer.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.352
You know what, Brett?
Neither will I.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.903
- Scott.
- You want me to call the cops?

14:45.987 --> 14:47.736
Dry him off, bring him up to the house.

14:48.260 --> 14:49.284
And no wet feet.

14:53.363 --> 14:55.047
Scott, you wanna get me a towel?

14:56.123 --> 14:57.771
Why are you walking so fast?

14:57.987 --> 14:59.855
Come on, you look like
an athlete... keep up.

14:59.874 --> 15:03.034
You really wanna get me home fast, it's
not the walk to the car that matters,

15:03.081 --> 15:04.958
- it's the drive home.
- What does that mean?

15:05.125 --> 15:07.398
- Means you drive slow.
- I=Oh yeah, right.

15:07.683 --> 15:08.683
Give me the keys.

15:11.122 --> 15:12.122
All right.

15:12.372 --> 15:13.809
Let's see what you got, hotshot.

15:13.934 --> 15:14.934
Thank you.

15:23.074 --> 15:24.332
You're out of your mind.

15:24.789 --> 15:26.301
I haven't even opened her up yet.

15:26.442 --> 15:27.616
You're doing 106.

15:27.744 --> 15:28.941
You nervous?

15:30.435 --> 15:32.464
- 110.
- All right, maybe a little.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.938
I don't know why
you want me to go with you.

15:38.985 --> 15:41.032
Even if she does wanna fuck you,
it's a hotel bar.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.116
- What could she possibly do?
- Convince me.

15:43.847 --> 15:45.771
You know I have a thing
for eastern-bloc women.

15:45.870 --> 15:47.667
Just pretend like
you didn't understand her.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.128
- I'll tell her the phone cut out.
- There she is.

15:55.994 --> 15:57.057
Hey, Nika.

15:57.806 --> 15:58.806
How are you?

16:00.047 --> 16:01.287
What is the meaning of this?

16:02.031 --> 16:04.171
- What's that?
- I asked you to come alone.

16:05.122 --> 16:06.806
So why you bring the little man?

16:07.657 --> 16:08.662
Well...

16:08.765 --> 16:11.235
It's a creative meeting, and as a
producer, I just thought...

16:11.310 --> 16:13.978
Creative meeting is something
I do alone with my actors.

16:14.053 --> 16:16.456
It gives me a chance
to speak with them free of distractions

16:16.522 --> 16:18.369
of producers who may
have their own agenda.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.649
We're all on the same page here.

16:19.695 --> 16:21.536
We will be on the same
page when you leave.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.367
You can pick Vince up in two hours.

16:23.497 --> 16:24.943
That should be plenty of time.

16:25.895 --> 16:28.308
I'd really like to stay.
I won't say anything.

16:28.411 --> 16:31.651
- Could be like a babysitter.
- Why do we need a babysitter?

16:32.051 --> 16:34.455
You know, just to make sure
everything stays appropriate.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.621
What is it you thought
was going to happen here, Vincent?

16:40.370 --> 16:41.370
Nothing, I just...

16:41.593 --> 16:43.677
- Nothing. Nika...
- I'm talking to Vincent.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.868
As far as I am concerned,
you're not even here.

16:45.969 --> 16:48.222
You think I was trying to seduce you.

16:48.354 --> 16:51.056
Is this why you bring your little
chaperone... for protection?

16:51.162 --> 16:53.143
Because you assume I want to fuck?

16:54.411 --> 16:56.186
You americans are such conceited,

16:56.433 --> 16:57.938
self-absorbed pigs.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.356
You have made a terrible mistake.

17:06.378 --> 17:07.843
Maybe she didn't wanna fuck.

17:10.881 --> 17:13.021
I told everyone I work with
and everyone in my family

17:13.060 --> 17:15.595
that I'm doing this movie.
Now what am I supposed to tell them

17:15.614 --> 17:17.346
when they see
the kid brother from my show

17:17.412 --> 17:19.055
dropping "f" bombs with Chris Tucker?

17:19.196 --> 17:21.789
I feel for you, I do, but
I've got nothing in this movie for you.

17:21.911 --> 17:23.385
The only parts I got are French.

17:23.921 --> 17:26.821
Je parle français.
I speak it, Brett.

17:27.761 --> 17:28.781
I'll do it for free!

17:29.025 --> 17:30.067
I'll pay you.

17:30.184 --> 17:32.468
- Jesus Christ.
- All right, seriously.

17:32.688 --> 17:34.125
What if I fly myself out,

17:34.183 --> 17:36.308
put myself up,
you give me a little something;

17:36.396 --> 17:39.063
if I don't deliver, you cut it.
Or cut it anyway.

17:39.196 --> 17:42.656
As long as I'm on the call sheet
and listed on IMDB, we're all good.

17:42.892 --> 17:45.309
You're telling me you're gonna
spend 20 grand to go to Paris

17:45.310 --> 17:46.946
for a part that I might end up cutting?

17:48.058 --> 17:50.162
Such is my passion for movies.

17:52.433 --> 17:55.002
Congrats. You can play
the bus driver on the Champs-Élysées.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.148
Yes! Ici venez, frère!

17:58.497 --> 18:00.666
That's french for "come here, bro."

18:01.172 --> 18:03.378
All right, all right. You good?

18:03.745 --> 18:05.166
- Oh, yeah.
- You'll leave?

18:05.619 --> 18:06.619
Yeah, I'll leave.

18:07.809 --> 18:10.093
Actually, I need you
to let me do one more thing.

18:10.369 --> 18:12.839
What the fuck did you guys do?

18:12.932 --> 18:15.173
- Nothing, really.
- We just showed up at the bar

18:15.248 --> 18:17.868
and she inferred a lot
from that without any help from us.

18:17.995 --> 18:20.402
Was she right?
Was her inference right?

18:20.477 --> 18:21.725
She can't prove that.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.906
Yair Marx is not a guy
you want angry with you.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.563
- Yair Marx is on the phone.
- Jesus Christ.

18:29.807 --> 18:31.993
Yair, we making a movie or not?

18:32.322 --> 18:34.914
<i>You heard about Vincent
and Nika's creative meeting?</i>

18:35.014 --> 18:37.057
Oh, not yet. I just got out
of a meeting myself

18:37.126 --> 18:39.110
and I just jumped in to take your call.

18:39.931 --> 18:42.287
<i>It went very well.
We want to make this movie.</i>

18:42.390 --> 18:44.237
<i>We want to have you all
to the house tonight</i>

18:44.321 --> 18:46.171
<i>for a check-signing dinner celebration.</i>

18:46.245 --> 18:48.297
- Sounds great.
- 8:00 p.m., Ari.

18:51.517 --> 18:52.727
That was an odd turn.

18:53.472 --> 18:54.787
Do you think he's setting us up?

18:54.998 --> 18:57.069
For what? What do you think,
the guy's a killer?

18:57.559 --> 18:58.672
He's not a killer, is he?

18:58.757 --> 19:00.997
I don't know what he is,
Vince. He could be Mossad,

19:01.087 --> 19:03.256
he could be Hezbollah...
Neither would surprise me.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.970
Fuck him then. We don't need
to get involved with a guy like that.

19:06.026 --> 19:08.037
Yes we do.
We just sold the house.

19:08.084 --> 19:09.593
We don't even have a place to live.

19:09.807 --> 19:12.699
We need somebody to pay for this movie
and this guy's gonna do it...

19:12.824 --> 19:13.869
Trust me!

19:18.533 --> 19:20.042
So what else do I gotta do?

19:20.919 --> 19:23.567
Well, you'd have
to tell me your real name.

19:25.121 --> 19:28.726
What? Do you think I'd have sex
with someone saying, "oh, Turtle"?

19:32.182 --> 19:35.121
Daddy, Kelly's jerking off
another boy in the car!

19:35.550 --> 19:37.916
What are you talking about jerking off?
We're just kissing!

19:38.007 --> 19:39.707
And what does he mean by "another" one?

19:39.829 --> 19:40.862
I'd better go.

19:41.971 --> 19:43.155
Yeah, me too!

19:45.431 --> 19:46.501
I'll call you.

19:51.170 --> 19:52.296
Oh, there he is.

19:52.671 --> 19:54.662
- The movie star.
- How'd it go, Johnny?

19:55.472 --> 19:58.477
How do you think it went?
I went, I saw,

19:59.088 --> 20:00.862
- I conquered.
- Nice.

20:01.386 --> 20:04.268
So nice in fact, I had time
to look out for one of our own.

20:05.444 --> 20:07.650
Hey, Tommy, can I talk
to you for a second?

20:09.594 --> 20:11.913
- I dropped your name to Brett.
- Really?

20:12.306 --> 20:13.939
Yeah, and Chris and Jackie too.

20:14.459 --> 20:16.402
Anyway, you might wanna
keep your cell phone on,

20:16.468 --> 20:18.534
'cause we might be
traveling to Paris together.

20:19.060 --> 20:21.761
Holy shit!
Are you serious?

20:22.909 --> 20:24.515
I don't even know what to say.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.934
I do.

20:26.370 --> 20:28.896
Say if you get it,
the plane tickets are on you.

20:29.621 --> 20:30.621
Absolutely.

20:31.777 --> 20:32.869
I owe you, Drama.

20:33.557 --> 20:35.067
You do indeed, Tommy.

20:37.309 --> 20:39.045
My chef is the best in the world.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.860
You know, I stole him from Le Cirque.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.872
You tell anyone, Yair, or is there
still an amber alert out on the guy?

20:43.932 --> 20:46.699
- Yes, cute, Ari.
- Offer the dessert, already.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.455
William! Voilà, bring the dessert, huh?

20:50.054 --> 20:51.519
No no.
No dessert for me.

20:51.571 --> 20:53.625
- I'm full.
- Yeah, me too, I'm completely stuffed.

20:53.709 --> 20:55.647
You don't get this figure
by eating desserts.

20:55.892 --> 20:57.610
You gentlemen will want this, huh?

21:04.437 --> 21:05.437
Rich.

21:05.624 --> 21:06.834
Help yourself, Vincent.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.185
<i>- Medellin, huh?
- Medellin!</i>

21:13.938 --> 21:16.021
Thank you so much, really.

21:16.812 --> 21:17.812
Thank you, Nika.

21:19.626 --> 21:20.811
I'll be upstairs.

21:24.687 --> 21:26.476
She hasn't been feeling well, huh?

21:27.188 --> 21:29.470
Come, let us take our drinks
out in the garden, huh?

21:29.634 --> 21:32.132
The view is spectacular, huh?

21:36.250 --> 21:38.285
Hang back with me for a moment, Vince.

21:38.502 --> 21:40.619
- I'd like to speak with you.
- Sure. What's up?

21:41.749 --> 21:43.721
You are excited to make this movie, yes?

21:43.940 --> 21:45.745
I can't tell you how appreciative I am.

21:47.002 --> 21:48.949
Listen. I know what happened today...

21:49.999 --> 21:52.653
- with my wife.
- You know?

21:54.814 --> 21:57.571
- I feel terrible.
- Hey, imagine how terrible I felt

21:57.814 --> 22:00.688
to see this beautiful woman
come home heartbroken and in tears.

22:00.877 --> 22:03.811
You know, in 1990, she was voted
eastern Europe's most beautiful...

22:03.970 --> 22:06.477
- over Paulina Porizkova.
- I'm sorry.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.307
Yeah, you need to apologize...
Not to me, but to her.

22:09.448 --> 22:10.838
Yeah, no problem.

22:12.369 --> 22:13.401
Good.

22:14.438 --> 22:16.174
She's upstairs waiting for you...

22:16.565 --> 22:17.565
In the bedroom.

22:19.846 --> 22:20.963
Are you serious?

22:22.164 --> 22:24.248
I never joke about my wife's happiness.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.393
What she wants,
I get for her.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.174
Now if you want
this check to clear,

22:29.690 --> 22:31.858
you will go upstairs
and you will fuck my wife

22:31.922 --> 22:33.367
like the superstar you are

22:33.462 --> 22:36.110
while I stay down here and play
billiards with your friends, huh?

22:38.503 --> 22:40.470
Ari, those are my Cubans!

22:41.305 --> 22:47.495
