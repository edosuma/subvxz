00:01.745 --> 00:03.220
- Hey guys!
- Hey.

00:03.389 --> 00:05.336
It's freezing out there.
Where's your coat?

00:05.462 --> 00:08.647
I'm Canadian. I don't need a coat.
This kind of weather is nothing for me.

00:08.815 --> 00:11.127
Yeah. This is like a spring day
back in Minnesota,

00:11.252 --> 00:14.239
if it weren't for all the taxis,
the skyscrapers and non-white people.

00:14.732 --> 00:17.453
- There aren't any black people?
- Not if Prince is on tour.

00:31.477 --> 00:34.334
Well, my sister's plane
got in an hour ago,

00:34.459 --> 00:36.069
or as a meteorologist might say,

00:36.194 --> 00:38.237
Hurricane Heather
has just made landfall.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.156
Come on. She's not that bad.

00:40.722 --> 00:42.751
{\pos(192,210)}Here's the back of
Heather's baseball card.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.479
{\pos(192,210)}It took her six years to graduate
from three different colleges,

00:45.604 --> 00:47.407
{\pos(192,220)}during which time
she wrecked two cars,

00:47.532 --> 00:49.169
{\pos(192,230)}got married for five days,

00:49.294 --> 00:51.780
{\pos(192,210)}and lived in a tree for nine weeks,
only to realize that

00:51.906 --> 00:54.298
{\pos(192,210)}no one had any intention
of cutting it down.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.143
And now, Heather says
she's moving to New York.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.728
That's big news.

00:58.895 --> 01:01.296
{\pos(192,210)}She's never gonna go through with it.
Remember a few years back

01:01.421 --> 01:03.611
{\pos(192,210)}when she talked about transferring
to NYU? And then,

01:03.779 --> 01:05.447
on the day of the admissions...

01:06.040 --> 01:06.892
Heather?

01:07.199 --> 01:09.120
Where's my couch and my TV?

01:10.707 --> 01:13.746
I sold them
for Nine Inch Nails tickets.

01:14.822 --> 01:16.566
The TV alone is worth two grand.

01:16.957 --> 01:19.971
Well, a last-minute plane ticket
is expensive.

01:20.972 --> 01:23.810
- Wait. Where are you?
- Somewhere in Spain.

01:24.973 --> 01:26.994
Oh! Gotta go. Slow song.

01:31.186 --> 01:32.197
{\pos(192,180)}Oh, crap.

01:32.775 --> 01:34.395
{\pos(192,180)}- It's Barney.
- So?

01:34.520 --> 01:36.883
{\pos(192,210)}For all the years Heather's
been visiting New York,

01:37.007 --> 01:38.543
{\pos(192,210)}Ted's never let Barney meet her.

01:38.793 --> 01:39.974
{\pos(192,210)}And I never will.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.759
{\pos(192,210)}Every year when the Mosby family
Christmas card shows up...

01:44.384 --> 01:46.471
<i>Pulling down her pants</i>

01:46.764 --> 01:48.567
<i>{\pos(192,210)}Yanking off my own</i>

01:49.085 --> 01:50.671
<i>{\pos(192,210)}Underneath the mistletoe</i>

01:50.797 --> 01:52.616
<i>{\pos(192,210)}I'll make your sister moan</i>

01:52.741 --> 01:56.314
<i>{\pos(192,210)}Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot
And we'll go all the way...</i>

01:56.532 --> 01:58.698
<i>I wish I could see her naked</i>

01:58.823 --> 02:00.870
<i>I wish I could see her naked</i>

02:01.038 --> 02:04.981
<i>{\pos(192,210)}I wish I could see her naked.
And down on all fours.</i>

02:06.602 --> 02:09.767
<i>Ted has a little sister
Gets hotter every day</i>

02:09.892 --> 02:13.187
<i>And if I ever meet her
With her boobies I will play! Everybody!</i>

02:13.312 --> 02:14.686
<i>Sister, sister, sister!</i>

02:16.195 --> 02:17.816
What? I can celebrate Hanukkah, too.

02:20.019 --> 02:22.574
{\pos(192,210)}Oh, it's him again.
I should probably get it.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.241
<i>{\pos(192,210)}- Hey, Barney.
- Hey. What's on tap for tonight?</i>

02:25.366 --> 02:27.304
{\pos(192,210)}We're heading over
to Marshall and Lily's

02:27.429 --> 02:29.584
for a Kathy Bates movie marathon,
but not Misery.

02:29.708 --> 02:31.187
You wanna join us...?

02:32.260 --> 02:33.173
He hung up.

02:38.098 --> 02:40.285
{\pos(192,210)}- Hey.
- Oh, it's great to see you.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.816
{\pos(192,210)}Hey, kiddo. You look great.
How are things back home?

02:43.984 --> 02:46.009
{\pos(192,210)}Well, I moved into your old room.

02:46.259 --> 02:49.408
{\pos(192,210)}Did you know that you can see miss
Gottwald's bedroom across the street?

02:49.576 --> 02:50.595
Oh, yes.

02:50.872 --> 02:53.289
I am aware of that.
How's she looking?

02:53.457 --> 02:55.836
- Ted, she's 62.
- Answer the question.

02:56.479 --> 02:57.796
Surprisingly perky.

02:59.776 --> 03:01.447
{\pos(192,210)}Man, it is cold out there.

03:01.905 --> 03:03.466
{\pos(192,210)}Why, hello.

03:05.967 --> 03:07.954
I've been waiting for you.

03:09.073 --> 03:11.010
{\pos(192,210)}Wait a second.
That's not our chair.

03:11.135 --> 03:12.738
{\pos(192,210)}Did you bring that chair yourself?

03:13.331 --> 03:14.900
{\pos(192,210)}I need one that swivels.

03:30.851 --> 03:32.853
How did you even know
Heather was coming into town?

03:34.331 --> 03:35.909
Never tell me anything!

03:36.034 --> 03:38.550
You know I can't keep secrets
around Christmas!

03:38.675 --> 03:40.115
Robin's giving you an iPod!

03:42.145 --> 03:44.816
Ted, can I chat with you
for a sec in the kitchen?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.461
No one touch the chair.
It's a rental.

03:49.088 --> 03:52.176
I can't believe you've been hiding
your sister from me all these years.

03:52.344 --> 03:53.367
Do you blame me?

03:53.492 --> 03:54.854
You're like Weird Al Yankovic

03:54.979 --> 03:57.702
if he only wrote Christmas songs
about banging my sister.

03:59.414 --> 04:01.775
Okay. First of all, I'm flattered.

04:02.737 --> 04:04.845
Secondly, they're just jokes.

04:04.970 --> 04:07.007
A bro can joke
about another bro's sister.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.037
It doesn't mean
I'm ever gonna act on it.

04:09.612 --> 04:11.784
I love my sister,
and as her older brother,

04:11.909 --> 04:14.004
it's my job to protect her
from guys like you.

04:14.603 --> 04:17.594
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No. And I don't trust her either.

04:18.035 --> 04:18.827
Fine.

04:18.952 --> 04:19.867
Great.

04:20.588 --> 04:23.102
I guess I'll just...
take my chair and go.

04:28.099 --> 04:29.863
Wait... Stop... Come back...

04:32.196 --> 04:35.539
Lily and I are taking Heather out
for dinner on Sunday. Do you wanna come?

04:35.706 --> 04:37.716
I already called Hurley's
and added a fourth.

04:37.841 --> 04:40.756
- You really can't tell Lily anything.
- No, you can't tell her... Jeez.

04:41.228 --> 04:44.338
<i>That year, the holidays were really
making Aunt Robin miss Canada,</i>

04:44.462 --> 04:46.555
<i>so Marshall brought her
to the spot he went whenever </i>

04:46.680 --> 04:48.366
<i>he got homesick for Minnesota:</i>

04:48.492 --> 04:49.729
<i>The Walleye Saloon.</i>

04:49.897 --> 04:51.252
Evening, everybody.

04:51.377 --> 04:53.652
- Marshall!
- Meet Robin.

04:53.820 --> 04:54.707
Robin!

04:55.197 --> 04:57.503
- Go back to drinking.
- Drinking!

04:58.353 --> 05:00.663
- What's up, Marshall?
- Hey, what's u...? Bud!

05:00.832 --> 05:03.948
- What's with the hitch in your giddyap?
- I was playing some hockey today.

05:04.073 --> 05:06.381
- Tore up something in my knee.
- Did you go to the hospital?

05:06.549 --> 05:09.276
Nah. I just poured some beer on it.
Can't miss the Vikes game.

05:09.401 --> 05:10.887
Twin Cities!

05:13.690 --> 05:14.978
I love the guys here.

05:15.146 --> 05:18.778
They're real men.
No hair products or manicures.

05:19.199 --> 05:21.029
All New York guys are like 10% girl.

05:21.932 --> 05:23.659
Come on.
That seems a little unfair.

05:23.908 --> 05:27.269
<i>I'll have the vichyssoise
with just a soup√ßon of creme fraiche.</i>

05:27.394 --> 05:29.418
Too much dairy and I tend to bloat.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.300
So... I found an apartment today.

05:34.552 --> 05:37.154
- Really?
- And I was hoping you'd have

05:37.278 --> 05:40.326
a little more wine in you
before I asked you this, but...

05:41.249 --> 05:43.399
I need you to co-sign the lease.

05:46.064 --> 05:47.543
Let me think about it.

05:48.089 --> 05:50.243
That means he's not going to do it.

05:50.944 --> 05:52.915
I could really use
your help on this.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.947
Let's talk about this later, okay?

05:55.642 --> 05:57.255
Don't hold your breath.

05:57.759 --> 05:58.920
What is it?

05:59.508 --> 06:02.039
- You don't trust me?
- You're my sister.

06:02.635 --> 06:04.722
Now he's just stating a fact.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.615
Look, Ted,

06:06.860 --> 06:09.402
I am serious about
a career in finance, but...

06:09.527 --> 06:11.616
you just keep looking at me like I'm

06:11.741 --> 06:14.082
a four-year-old who says
she wants to be an astronaut.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.288
I just don't think you have any idea
how tough it is to make it in New York.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.839
Exactly. You need connections.

06:20.137 --> 06:23.509
If only Ted knew someone
who worked at, say...

06:23.634 --> 06:26.579
Goliath National Bank,
then... wait.

06:27.084 --> 06:28.036
What?

06:29.147 --> 06:31.501
I work at Goliath National Bank.

06:31.626 --> 06:32.796
How'bout that?

06:34.883 --> 06:35.868
All right.

06:36.109 --> 06:39.490
We got two Bemidji Pale Ales
and... who ordered the mini-burgers?

06:44.384 --> 06:45.375
Oh, my God!

06:45.543 --> 06:47.170
Is that Fisherman's Quest?

06:47.338 --> 06:49.257
I used to play FQ
all the time back home!

06:49.425 --> 06:51.092
Oh, yeah? I kinda have high score.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.482
Not to brag, but I caught...

06:54.630 --> 06:56.267
a 35-inch northern pike.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.242
The biggest video fish
anyone's ever reeled in.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.562
I mean... freshwater.

07:02.994 --> 07:04.866
A tip of the angler's cap,
my friend.

07:06.327 --> 07:08.297
Thank you for bringing me here.

07:09.550 --> 07:10.753
Those are mine.

07:12.381 --> 07:14.193
This is not a good idea.

07:14.415 --> 07:16.800
Heather and Barney
alone in his office?

07:16.968 --> 07:19.138
I certainly don't want
to be on the hook for her lease.

07:19.307 --> 07:22.092
She is growing up.
You just can't see it yet.

07:22.353 --> 07:24.766
We're talking about a girl
who was busted for shoplifting

07:24.891 --> 07:26.107
eight months ago.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.883
Ted, a lot of women
go through a shoplifting phase.

07:30.176 --> 07:32.481
And sure, maybe to this day,

07:32.606 --> 07:35.641
they swipe the occasional smaller item
because it turns them on

07:35.767 --> 07:37.794
in a weird way
that they can't quite explain.

07:39.018 --> 07:39.823
But...

07:39.949 --> 07:43.529
if it'll make you feel better,
I'll tag along to GNB tomorrow.

07:43.654 --> 07:45.661
I'll say I'm having lunch
with Marshall,

07:45.786 --> 07:48.311
but actually, I'll be spying
on her and Barney.

07:50.459 --> 07:52.237
Okay, I'm good with that.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.045
Heather!

07:54.304 --> 07:55.989
Heather! Good luck tomorrow at GNB.

07:56.157 --> 07:59.337
- I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead.
- And I'll be spying on you guys.

07:59.462 --> 08:00.369
Damn it!

08:03.795 --> 08:07.466
"I'm drinking till I forget
the 1999 NFC Championship"?

08:08.027 --> 08:09.221
That game.

08:09.575 --> 08:12.169
The Vikings were two minutes away
from going to the Super Bowl,

08:12.294 --> 08:14.611
when our kicker,
who hadn't missed all year shanked

08:14.736 --> 08:16.982
a field goal,
and we lost in overtime.

08:17.151 --> 08:17.949
Damn!

08:18.777 --> 08:21.240
'99 NFC Championship game?
Damn!

08:23.201 --> 08:25.606
My dad, who I'd never
seen cry my whole life,

08:25.731 --> 08:27.034
wiped away a tear.

08:27.630 --> 08:28.662
He said...

08:29.239 --> 08:31.506
"A little part of me
just died, Son."

08:33.827 --> 08:36.255
I love how intense you guys are
about your Vikings.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.710
It's like when we watch
hockey night in Canada...

08:41.159 --> 08:42.023
What?

08:42.392 --> 08:43.394
Don't let

08:43.519 --> 08:46.849
anyone in here know
that you're not from Minnesota.

08:46.974 --> 08:49.619
Why? What are they gonna do
if they find out I'm from...

08:50.306 --> 08:52.385
Does this look like
a Dallas bar to you, Pal?

08:52.510 --> 08:55.722
It's weird, there's something comforting
about being carried like this.

08:59.674 --> 09:00.435
Right?

09:00.856 --> 09:02.864
Man, can you believe that guy?

09:03.791 --> 09:05.485
So, Robin, where are you from?

09:10.717 --> 09:11.487
Bemidji.

09:12.513 --> 09:14.287
Bemidji, Minnesota.

09:14.650 --> 09:15.724
Go, Vikes!

09:18.162 --> 09:21.143
<i>Kids, for what happened next,
I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.</i>

09:22.525 --> 09:24.926
That is a pretty sweet briefcase.

09:25.094 --> 09:27.389
That's a pretty sweet
security camera, too.

09:27.557 --> 09:29.973
Oh! And there's another one.
And a guard.

09:30.098 --> 09:33.823
- I'm planning on paying for it, Ted.
- Yeah. You don't have the job yet.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.750
That door's a push, not a pull.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.657
There you go.

09:39.331 --> 09:41.498
Thanks again for keeping
an eye on her yesterday.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.556
Maybe I was wrong. She sounds like
she handled Barney just fine.

09:44.681 --> 09:48.076
- Maybe she'll be able to handle NY.
- No thanks necessary!

09:49.342 --> 09:50.926
- Why not?
- I have a secret.

09:51.095 --> 09:53.097
No, I don't! Nothing happened.
Something happened.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.157
- What happened?
- Nothing.

09:56.283 --> 09:59.858
After Heather's interview, I went to say
hi to Marshall for a few minutes,

10:00.318 --> 10:01.853
and when I came back...

10:03.000 --> 10:04.680
Oh, my God!

10:04.992 --> 10:08.621
Lily, before you say or do anything,
I beg you one favor.

10:08.790 --> 10:10.792
- What?
- Get off that. It's Prada.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.440
I am so sorry.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.419
I knew it.
I knew it all along.

10:16.544 --> 10:19.464
She is still the same, irresponsible
train wreck that she always was,

10:19.589 --> 10:21.985
- and when I see Barney...
- You won't say a word.

10:22.111 --> 10:24.412
Ted, Heather begged me
not to tell you.

10:24.549 --> 10:26.985
She will hate my guts
if she knows that I blabbed.

10:27.648 --> 10:30.938
Oh, I love that briefcase,
but I can't afford it.

10:31.524 --> 10:33.071
You were right, Ted.

10:34.335 --> 10:36.416
- I certainly was.
- See?

10:36.585 --> 10:39.504
She didn't get the briefcase!
That's responsible!

10:39.885 --> 10:43.053
And there's almost no way
she had sex with anyone in there.

10:43.482 --> 10:45.162
Turning over a new leaf.

10:50.601 --> 10:51.760
Evening, everybody!

10:51.885 --> 10:55.365
So my dad and I are
at the '99 NFC Championship game.

10:56.128 --> 10:57.870
I say evening, everybody!

10:57.995 --> 11:00.016
And when we missed
that field goal and lost...

11:00.141 --> 11:01.179
Damn!

11:01.646 --> 11:02.746
Damn! Damn.

11:04.524 --> 11:06.946
... my dad, who I had never seen cry

11:07.326 --> 11:08.636
in my entire life,

11:09.771 --> 11:11.568
wiped away a tear and said,

11:13.074 --> 11:15.234
"A little part of me
just died, Son."

11:15.734 --> 11:16.567
"Son"?

11:19.138 --> 11:21.072
I told it the way
I'm gonna tell my son.

11:21.756 --> 11:24.670
If I'm ever lucky enough
to have a son,

11:25.521 --> 11:26.730
and name him

11:28.587 --> 11:30.005
Rashad Tarkenton.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.291
- Great story.
- Great story!

11:35.431 --> 11:37.433
But it does sound
a little bit familiar.

11:37.721 --> 11:39.937
I know!
They totally ate it up.

11:40.345 --> 11:41.814
I see what you're doing here.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.575
- What?
- I brought you here as a favor because,

11:45.507 --> 11:47.262
because I felt sorry for you, okay?

11:47.387 --> 11:49.755
And now it's like you're trying
to steal my bar.

11:49.881 --> 11:52.373
You think I'm trying
to steal your bar?

11:52.541 --> 11:53.934
Oh, get oot.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.255
"Get oot"?
What, are you Canadian?

11:56.695 --> 11:59.130
- No, I...
- You want to impersonate a Canadian,

11:59.255 --> 12:02.249
just turn of the lights
and get all scared!

12:06.409 --> 12:09.328
- What was that?
- With Canada right across the border,

12:09.454 --> 12:12.457
we Minnesotans sometimes like to make
jokes at your guys' expense

12:12.583 --> 12:14.643
and they're all sort of along
the same theme.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.992
- That we're afraid of the dark?
- Yeah. For example:

12:18.462 --> 12:22.163
Everyone, how many Canadians
does it take to change a lightbulb?

12:23.522 --> 12:26.330
"What? No, the lightbulb's out?
I'm scared!"

12:28.383 --> 12:31.604
That is insane. Why do you think
the Canadians are afraid of the dark?

12:31.782 --> 12:34.538
Where does any prejudice come from?
A stereotype starts,

12:34.663 --> 12:36.664
and all of a sudden
it spreads like wildfire.

12:36.789 --> 12:39.100
Like Asians can't drive,
Scotsmen are cheap,

12:39.225 --> 12:41.244
Brazilians always put on way
too much postage.

12:41.888 --> 12:44.030
I just don't think
this is gonna work out, Robin.

12:44.155 --> 12:47.770
You can't be hanging out with people
who belittle your beloved homeland,

12:47.894 --> 12:49.187
so I'll walk you out.

12:49.587 --> 12:51.929
No, wait, I have something to say.

12:53.705 --> 12:54.990
Hey, everybody.

12:55.728 --> 12:58.606
Let me tell you something
about people from Canada.

12:58.774 --> 13:00.469
Please don't make a scene

13:01.622 --> 13:04.198
Do you know why Canadians
never get a birthday wish?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.462
Because they're too afraid
to blow out the candles.

13:10.419 --> 13:12.348
Oh, God, I love it here. God.

13:14.219 --> 13:16.746
I think your prospects
at GNB are good.

13:17.076 --> 13:19.892
You certainly made it clear
you're will to take any position.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.567
Are these new coasters?

13:21.939 --> 13:23.326
I hope you get the job.

13:23.451 --> 13:26.482
Nothing gives me more pleasure
than filling an opening.

13:26.778 --> 13:29.238
I swear to God
these coasters are thicker.

13:29.407 --> 13:32.660
- I am willing to bend over backwards.
- Okay, that's it!

13:32.837 --> 13:34.914
I cannot believe you had sex
with my sister!

13:36.101 --> 13:38.411
- You blabbed?
- Do you know what?

13:38.536 --> 13:41.620
This is a new batch
of the old coasters.

13:41.745 --> 13:44.392
I'm just gonna confirm that
with the bartender.

13:44.518 --> 13:47.648
You're mature and responsible now?
Is it mature and responsible

13:47.773 --> 13:51.316
to go to your first big job interview in
New York City and nail a total stranger?

13:51.892 --> 13:54.312
You've always been immature
and irresponsible. You will always be

13:54.437 --> 13:55.788
immature and irresponsible.

13:55.914 --> 13:59.146
And I wouldn't cosign a library card
for you, let alone a lease.

13:59.609 --> 14:02.251
- Barney and I didn't have sex.
- Save it. Lily saw you.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.754
Or did she?

14:04.172 --> 14:07.818
You see, Ted, you had so little faith
in Heather and me...

14:07.943 --> 14:10.817
... we decided to give you
exactly what you expected of us.

14:10.942 --> 14:13.050
And I knew we could count
on Lily to blab.

14:13.175 --> 14:14.395
Oh, my God!

14:15.106 --> 14:17.687
- What? Why would you do that?
- Because you deserved it.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.864
Ted, you know I'm no saint.

14:20.332 --> 14:24.145
And yes, it's true that time I drove
your mother to the airport,

14:24.810 --> 14:26.704
well, let's just say there was a...

14:26.830 --> 14:30.818
very confusing, sexually charged moment
in short-term parking,

14:31.617 --> 14:34.793
but I said I would never go near
your sister,

14:34.918 --> 14:37.224
and I meant it.
You should have trusted me.

14:37.519 --> 14:41.084
You're so convinced
I'm still some out-of-control teenager,

14:41.209 --> 14:43.402
you missed the fact I grew up.

14:44.154 --> 14:46.931
I'm gonna find a hotel.
I'll get my things later.

14:47.943 --> 14:49.215
Merry Christmas.

14:54.773 --> 14:56.241
Your mom and I kissed.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.389
Better get a move on. You got 5 seconds
to catch two more sturgeon.

15:01.557 --> 15:03.684
Hey, we got a possible gill screen.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.065
Forget it. You can't catch two fish
with one hook.

15:07.234 --> 15:08.176
No,

15:08.301 --> 15:10.520
but I can catch one fish

15:10.963 --> 15:12.467
and use that fish

15:12.911 --> 15:14.556
to catch the other one.

15:16.830 --> 15:19.367
High score!
You beat Marshall!

15:20.457 --> 15:22.298
She's Canadian!

15:22.796 --> 15:24.887
Robin's Canadian!

15:26.067 --> 15:27.433
She's Canadian.

15:28.184 --> 15:31.814
She's not from Bemidji and she doesn't
know a darn thing about the Vikings.

15:31.983 --> 15:34.081
You're just mad
'cause she got high score.

15:35.473 --> 15:38.097
In the '99 NFC Championship game

15:38.518 --> 15:40.632
- when the Vikings lost...
- Damn!

15:40.757 --> 15:41.773
Oh, damn!

15:42.917 --> 15:46.372
... who was the kicker
who missed the field goal?

15:53.887 --> 15:55.350
Rashad Tarkenton.

15:58.263 --> 16:00.085
Gary Anderson.

16:01.007 --> 16:03.902
He's now retired.
Owns a fly-fishing business...

16:04.619 --> 16:05.534
in Canada.

16:07.696 --> 16:08.907
Good-bye, Robin.

16:20.235 --> 16:21.434
You know what?

16:22.104 --> 16:23.564
I'm glad you found oot

16:24.327 --> 16:26.486
because I'm proud to be Canadian.

16:27.405 --> 16:29.950
We may not have a fancy NFL team
or Prince,

16:31.707 --> 16:34.151
but we invented Trivial Pursuit.

16:34.516 --> 16:35.989
You're welcome, Earth!

16:37.062 --> 16:40.219
Plus in Canada, you can go
to an all-nude strip club

16:40.344 --> 16:41.928
and order alcohol.

16:42.639 --> 16:45.564
That's right.
From Moosejaw to the Bay of Fundy,

16:45.689 --> 16:48.091
you can suck down a 20-ounce Pilsner

16:48.216 --> 16:51.846
while watching some coal miner's
daughter strip down to her pelt.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.029
Jealous?

16:54.575 --> 16:57.452
In Canada people don't care
where you're from,

16:57.845 --> 17:00.576
as long as you're friendly
and maybe loan them a smoke

17:00.701 --> 17:02.503
or hand over a donut.

17:03.965 --> 17:06.191
I'm proud to be from
the Great White North...

17:07.036 --> 17:09.009
and I wish I was there right now.

17:12.276 --> 17:14.290
And we're not afraid of the dark.

17:16.355 --> 17:18.737
I mean, we don't love it,
but who does?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.126
Merry Christmas.

17:34.624 --> 17:35.556
Look inside.

17:38.896 --> 17:42.193
You just, if you push it towards the...
Not down, towards the middle.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.079
- Don't need your help.
- Got it.

17:52.291 --> 17:53.544
You signed the lease.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.215
You know why?

17:57.043 --> 17:59.758
Because you trust me
and think it's a great idea?

18:00.284 --> 18:02.317
Because I want to get to know you.

18:02.841 --> 18:03.931
The new you.

18:05.205 --> 18:06.227
Thanks.

18:10.686 --> 18:12.450
By the way,
in your new neighborhood,

18:12.575 --> 18:15.288
you really should get a good
solid deadbolt for the door.

18:16.207 --> 18:17.369
If you want...

18:18.314 --> 18:19.347
to live.

18:29.287 --> 18:33.219
I'm so sorry for what happened
back there. I acted like a total jerk.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.450
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:37.982 --> 18:41.154
That was your place.
I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.

18:41.853 --> 18:44.497
Just every year at the holidays,
I get homesick.

18:45.047 --> 18:47.411
And so far, every year
I've had a reason to stay:

18:47.536 --> 18:49.214
a boyfriend, a job,

18:49.945 --> 18:51.013
or something.

18:52.202 --> 18:55.034
But... this year for the first time,
I don't.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.224
Yes, you do.

18:57.785 --> 18:58.608
What?

18:59.593 --> 19:01.690
We all love you, okay?

19:02.705 --> 19:04.434
If you ever moved back to Canada,

19:04.559 --> 19:07.273
we would hop on a plane,
we would track you down,

19:07.398 --> 19:09.249
and after Barney dragged us

19:09.374 --> 19:12.004
to a few of those strip clubs
you talked about,

19:12.173 --> 19:15.464
we would bring you back right here
where you're supposed to be.

19:16.786 --> 19:19.058
It's not New York
without Robin Scherbatsky.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.592
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:23.282 --> 19:24.942
I just miss it there sometimes.

19:26.097 --> 19:29.867
I wish I could blink my eyes and be back
in Canada for an hour, you know?

19:31.782 --> 19:33.456
I was hoping you would say that.

19:35.438 --> 19:38.464
<i>Once, there was this girl</i>

19:38.934 --> 19:41.779
<i>Who wouldn't go and change</i>

19:41.905 --> 19:45.475
<i>- With the girls in the change room...
- How did you find this place?</i>

19:45.644 --> 19:48.643
- Feels like home, right?
- There's one way to find out.

19:51.237 --> 19:53.154
Sorry there.
Didn't see ya. Are you okay?

19:53.537 --> 19:56.477
- I'm fine.
- Okay, sorry aboot that.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.978
Have a donut on the hoose.

19:59.103 --> 20:00.455
- Thanks.
- Okay.

20:02.589 --> 20:06.568
You bumped into him, and he apologized
and gave you a donut on the hoose?

20:06.694 --> 20:08.428
Oh, it's just like home.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.734
Sorry!

20:12.340 --> 20:14.732
It's gonna be fine!
Sorry.

20:16.509 --> 20:18.070
No one likes the dark.

20:25.751 --> 20:29.005
<i>Next up from Ontario:
Marshall Erickson.</i>

20:29.173 --> 20:31.090
I didn't know you signed up.
What's your song?

20:31.259 --> 20:32.844
I think you'll recognize it.

20:33.014 --> 20:36.655
<i>But that's okay, I'm gonna
rock your body anyway</i>

20:36.780 --> 20:38.818
<i>I'm gonna rock your body
to Canada Day!</i>

20:38.954 --> 20:41.066
Buddy, you can turn off the screen.
We know the lyrics.

20:41.236 --> 20:44.864
<i>Everybody come and play</i>

20:45.034 --> 20:48.536
<i>Throw every last care away</i>

20:49.044 --> 20:52.084
Let's go to the mall

20:52.615 --> 20:54.128
today!
