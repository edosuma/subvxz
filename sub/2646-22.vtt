I needed his help this morning,
and he let me down.

15:11.374 --> 15:14.711
That doesn't sound like him. You asked
him to do something and he didn't do it?

15:14.795 --> 15:17.839
But he never asked!
I mean, all he said was,

15:17.923 --> 15:20.926
“Lily's bag needs to be packed and
the newspaper needs to be canceled.”

15:21.009 --> 15:23.095
That sounds to me
like he was asking for help.

15:23.178 --> 15:26.389
Sounds to me like you
expected him to read your mind.

15:26.473 --> 15:29.226
- What am I, a psychic?
- No! It's not about reading minds.

15:29.309 --> 15:31.436
It's about knowing
what your partner needs.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.022
Here's an idea:
just say “help me.”

15:34.106 --> 15:36.108
You don't even have to
say “me,” just “help.”

15:36.191 --> 15:38.878
Then he'll know exactly what you
want. You won't have to get all mad.

15:38.902 --> 15:41.571
I'm not mad. It's just...

15:41.696 --> 15:45.992
You wanna believe you're on the same
wavelength as someone, and then it's just...

15:46.076 --> 15:48.411
