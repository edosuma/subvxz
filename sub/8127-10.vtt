            Boy, Michael,       
            when you walked out,

01:45.305 --> 01:46.905
            I didn't even think 
            we'd have a wedding,

really something,               

01:49.943 --> 01:51.576

wanting a priest                

01:51.578 --> 01:52.877
and Archie wanting              
a reverend.

      And you wanting out.      

01:56.449 --> 01:57.648

rigmarole.                      

02:00.020 --> 02:02.954
        You didn't want         
     to get married at all.     

02:02.956 --> 02:04.956
 You wanted to go off someplace 
        and live in sin.        

02:08.193 --> 02:10.461
     You wanted all the fun

02:12.631 --> 02:14.632
                That's not fair,

              Michael came back,
              didn't he?        

02:16.169 --> 02:18.369
  And didn't he agree to have   
  the Reverend Felcher marry us?

02:18.371 --> 02:20.638
     Yeah, ain't it funny?      

02:20.640 --> 02:23.307

02:39.158 --> 02:41.960
You're supposed to be rehearsing

02:41.962 --> 02:45.063
         This here part         
      had enough practice.      

02:45.065 --> 02:48.066
         You know what          
they was doing out there?       

02:48.068 --> 02:49.934
Yeah, kissing.                  

02:51.937 --> 02:54.305
Archie, I think maybe           
for the rehearsal               

02:54.307 --> 02:55.940
we ought                        
to move the TV.                 

02:55.942 --> 02:58.576
It might be in the              
Reverend Felcher's way.         

02:58.578 --> 02:59.778
                         Listen,

02:59.780 --> 03:02.013
         if the Reverend Felcher
         wants that TV moved,   

03:02.015 --> 03:04.249
         he can lift it himself.

03:04.251 --> 03:07.518
I ain't about to lose a daughter
        and gain a truss.       

03:11.523 --> 03:13.457
Oh, Archie,                     
just think.                     

03:13.459 --> 03:15.827

getting married.                

03:18.832 --> 03:21.900
It just don't seem              
possible, does it?              

03:21.902 --> 03:23.168
         Yes, it does.          

03:23.170 --> 03:26.104
It seems like a nightmare       
        come true.              

03:26.106 --> 03:27.605
          Oh, Archie.

 Which, by the way, reminds me, 

03:30.710 --> 03:33.311

      it's time to, uh...

sit down and have a little talk 
    about the facts of life?

04:05.712 --> 04:08.112
            You know, you got   
            to explain to her   

04:08.114 --> 04:10.014
        about the wedding night.

04:13.453 --> 04:17.355
    But I didn't think          
you wanted Gloria to know       

04:17.357 --> 04:20.591
    about you falling asleep    
     on our wedding night.      

04:22.261 --> 04:25.029
     Will you forget that?      

04:28.400 --> 04:31.903
      You got to tell her       
 whatever your mother told you  

04:31.905 --> 04:33.571
 before you and me got married. 

04:39.345 --> 04:41.379
             Oh...              

04:43.515 --> 04:44.648

04:44.650 --> 04:48.152
            Yeah...             

04:48.154 --> 04:52.656
Oh, Archie, I ain't going       
to be no good at that.          

04:52.658 --> 04:55.026
Can't you talk to Gloria?       

04:55.028 --> 04:57.195
                         No.    

04:57.197 --> 04:59.430
              You're her mother.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.966
            You got to do the   
            explaining there.   

05:01.968 --> 05:03.368
              I mean, after all,
              I'm her father.   

05:03.370 --> 05:04.468
          A father ain't allowed

05:04.470 --> 05:05.669

                 stuff like that

05:05.671 --> 05:06.938
              with his daughter.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.276
Do you mean that if             
you was Mike's father,          

05:11.278 --> 05:12.743
you'd talk to him?              

05:12.745 --> 05:15.880
      If I was his father,      
    I'd run away from home.     

05:18.750 --> 05:21.452

    did the Reverend Felcher    

05:21.454 --> 05:23.054
    say he was coming over?     

05:23.056 --> 05:24.622
                     Uh...4:00. 

05:24.624 --> 05:26.124
                     We better  
                     go upstairs

05:26.126 --> 05:28.326
                and try on      
                the dress again.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.760
     We got to fix the hem.     

05:29.762 --> 05:33.664
    Mike, Archie wants          
        to talk to you.         

05:49.748 --> 05:51.582
    Where'd you get that hunk   
    of Boston cream pie?        

05:53.052 --> 05:54.919
Gloria said                     
I could have it.                

05:56.521 --> 05:57.521
        That was the last piece.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.357
            I had that scheduled
            for <i>Gunsmoke.</i>       

06:06.465 --> 06:07.665
You want it?                    

06:07.667 --> 06:09.533
            I don't want it now!

06:12.737 --> 06:16.107
         I want to talk to you  
         about, uh, the wedding.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.943
              I mean, about     
              after the wedding.

06:18.945 --> 06:22.847
Oh, you don't have to worry     
about that, Mr. Bunker.         

06:22.849 --> 06:24.449
There won't be                  
any problems.

06:28.754 --> 06:31.322
Oh, you mean                    
you had problems?               

06:31.324 --> 06:36.894
        No, I don't mean        
    I had no problems,          

06:36.896 --> 06:40.498
     because I took it easy     
    with my wife, see.          

06:40.500 --> 06:43.567
    I knew she wasn't going     
    to disappear overnight.     

06:43.569 --> 06:45.903
  You mean on the first night,  
         you didn't...          

06:45.905 --> 06:49.340
             I mean             
  that I didn't go rushing in   

06:49.342 --> 06:52.176
          like a bull           
      into a china closet.      

06:56.615 --> 06:59.317
That ain't just any woman       
you're marrying, you know.      

06:59.319 --> 07:01.719
     That's my little girl.     

07:01.721 --> 07:04.889
     So just take it easy,      

07:04.891 --> 07:09.260
      kind of get to know       
    one another there,          

07:09.262 --> 07:12.030
  give yourself a little time.  

07:14.133 --> 07:15.233
         How much time?         

07:20.872 --> 07:21.739
             Oh...              

07:23.542 --> 07:25.943
            A month.            

07:33.685 --> 07:35.253
            A month?            

07:35.255 --> 07:36.720
    That's ridiculous.          

07:36.722 --> 07:39.323
            It ain't ridiculous!

07:39.325 --> 07:40.558
        You got to be careful   

07:40.560 --> 07:42.960
             with a young bride,
             you know.          

07:42.962 --> 07:43.961
            That's your wife.   

07:43.963 --> 07:45.963
                 You got to     
                 treat her nice.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.499
     You got to put her         
     up there on a "pe-des-tal."

07:50.869 --> 07:53.671
Oh, you mean like what          
you do with Mrs. Bunker.        

07:53.673 --> 07:55.473
                  That is right.

07:56.608 --> 07:57.942
Thank you, Mr. Bunker.          

07:57.944 --> 07:59.843
I'll try to remember            
everything you said.
