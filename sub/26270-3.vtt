00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.321
MALE REPORTER:
A 7.1 earthquake
has rocked the Southland,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.656
and 250,000 homes
are without electricity.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.259
And for most,
there is an urgent need for...

00:25.293 --> 00:27.161
FEMALE REPORTER:
Traffic lights out
all over the city. Driving is

00:27.195 --> 00:29.230
-extremely hazardous.
-...will be posted
on our website.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.999
-The most deaths of any single
building collapse:
-...currently backlogged.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.502
-33 in total.
-Callers are urged
to refrain from dialing 911

00:34.535 --> 00:36.837
unless there is a
real and true emergency.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.839
No, sir, martial law
has not been declared,

00:38.872 --> 00:41.409
and even if it had, I'm pretty
sure that it's still illegal

00:41.442 --> 00:42.910
to just shoot anyone
who comes on your property.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.845
911. What is your emergency?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.214
Sorry, ma'am. We can't really
spare any units

00:46.247 --> 00:47.215
to come look for
your missing cat.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.882
Maybe put out a can of tuna?

00:48.916 --> 00:50.851
Yes, open.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.853
911. What is your emergency?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.355
Dispatch, we have a report
of looters at the Big 5

00:54.388 --> 00:57.024
on Wilshire and San Vicente...

00:57.057 --> 00:59.460
Wait, there are two
Wilshire and San Vicentes?

00:59.493 --> 01:00.594
I-I'm transferring you.
Please stay on the line.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.096
Don't hang up.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.697
I shouldn't be doing this.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.099
You're doing fine.
I've got my eye on you.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.934
People's lives
are at stake here.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.302
Look, we're stretched thin
on our best day,

01:08.336 --> 01:09.903
and today is definitely
not our best.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.873
Just get the frivolous calls off
the line, help the ones you can,

01:12.906 --> 01:15.476
and keep sending the higher
priority calls up the chain.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.610
You can do this.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.317
-(sighs)
-(line ringing)

01:23.351 --> 01:25.453
911. What is your emergency?

01:25.486 --> 01:26.987
DREW (on phone):
Uh, I-I need an ambulance.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.557
Uh, 6057 Comstock,
in Montebello.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.392
What is the nature
of your emergency?

01:31.425 --> 01:34.428
DREW:
My wife. She-She's just
over 32 weeks pregnant,

01:34.462 --> 01:36.564
a-and she went into labor
about an hour ago.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.765
Tell me your name.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.000
I-I'm Drew.
Uh, Drew Hudson.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.069
-My wife is-is Ainsley.
-Okay, Drew,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.338
32 weeks isn't so early that
we're in the danger zone.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.573
I want you to monitor
her breathing

01:45.606 --> 01:47.341
and time her contractions
for me.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.809
-No, I said
I need an ambulance!
-I'm sorry,

01:48.842 --> 01:50.678
but we're backed up
due to the earthquake.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.112
-As soon as I have
something available...
-What do you mean?!

01:52.146 --> 01:54.648
-You're-you're 911!
-I understand, sir,

01:54.682 --> 01:55.816
but our resources
are spread thin

01:55.849 --> 01:57.785
-all over the city.
-No, I need help!

01:57.818 --> 01:59.220
It's not coming.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.023
Help is not coming, Drew.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.858
-Oh, God.
-But it's okay.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.960
I-I'm here.
I'm a trained nurse,

02:06.994 --> 02:08.496
and I've delivered
a lot of babies.

02:08.529 --> 02:12.466
-I can talk you through this.
-No, you can't.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.602
She's unconscious.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.003
We were on our way
to the hospital

02:16.036 --> 02:18.206
when-when the second one hit.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.508
She fell.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.376
The baby was coming.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.412
It-It was coming.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.616
Drew, can you tell me
where she's been hurt?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.050
Uh, her-her head.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.186
It's-it's bleeding.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.787
Is there a lot of blood?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.290
No, no.
Uh, s-some. Not a lot.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.725
Okay, good.
Is she breathing?

02:37.758 --> 02:40.828
Yeah. Barely, but yes.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.730
Where is she now, Drew?

02:42.763 --> 02:44.232
I-I put her on the couch.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
Okay, but we don't want her
lying flat--

02:45.833 --> 02:48.135
can you gently move her
onto her left side?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.638
Yes.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.407
Good. Make sure her head
is elevated.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.675
This is gonna keep
her airway open.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.577
Ainsley and the baby
need to breathe.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.346
When can someone be here?

02:59.747 --> 03:01.048
Probably at least an hour

03:01.081 --> 03:02.416
before a truck can get there.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.717
(clears throat)
Drew,

03:03.751 --> 03:05.386
you said when
the last aftershock hit,

03:05.419 --> 03:07.221
you were getting ready to
take Ainsley to the hospital.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.256
Which hospital?

03:08.289 --> 03:10.891
Uh, Montebello Presbyterian.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.260
Sh-Should I take her there?

03:12.293 --> 03:14.061
Traffic lights out
here and here.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.195
This artery's gonna be jammed.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.998
Wait.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.734
If you can't get the first
responders to the caller...

03:20.768 --> 03:22.903
Get the caller
to the first responders.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.575
Okay, Drew, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.110
I want you to take Ainsley
to your car.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.212
I want her on her left side,
head elevated,

03:32.246 --> 03:33.914
just like we've been doing.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.048
Am I taking her to the hospital?

03:35.082 --> 03:36.884
No, we don't have time for that.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.588
I am sending you to a fire.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.629
Captain, 911.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.734
-This is Captain Martinez.
-Captain Martinez,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.636
this is dispatcher Maddie
Kendall at Parker Center.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.071
I have a young couple in a
Volkswagen Passat coming to you.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.240
The female is eight months
pregnant and unconscious.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.242
She was in active labor
when she was injured.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.912
They could really use
a miracle today.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.548
-(honking)
-We just might have
a few of those left.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.584
I see them.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.252
MARTINEZ:
EMTs!

04:12.286 --> 04:15.289
We're gonna get 'em
treated and transported.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.257
-MADDIE: Thank you, Captain.
-DREW: You got to help her.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.760
Thank you.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.261
Great work.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.163
(line ringing)

04:23.196 --> 04:26.867
911. What is your emergency?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.644
Caltech's calling that last
aftershock a 4.9.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.246
16th aftershock so far.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.582
I want a real-time assessment
of new damage,

04:41.615 --> 04:43.751
and a comprehensive report
on structural integrity

04:43.784 --> 04:46.320
throughout the building. Call
your people and get me updates.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.756
Excuse me.
No one's telling us anything

04:48.789 --> 04:50.758
about my daughter.
It's been hours.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.493
Sir, search and rescue
operations are continuing.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.161
As soon as we know anything,
you'll be advised.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.296
I want to go in there myself.
Let me go in and look for her.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.931
I can't allow you to do that.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.701
I'm afraid we'd wind up having
to rescue you, too.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.170
And your family needs you
right now.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.972
My family needs
my daughter back.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.274
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.143
What about the grid?
Show me who's left in there.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.346
GPS looks like it's got
a bead on everybody,

05:12.380 --> 05:14.548
but the 118's lost contact
with a firefighter.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.716
Who?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.151
BOBBY:
Hen, do you copy?

05:18.185 --> 05:20.954
This is Captain Nash for
Henrietta Wilson, do you copy?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.491
Cap, I think I got a visual.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.693
There's a pocket,
probably four feet.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.495
Can't see her, though.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.664
Hen! Hen, can you hear me?

05:30.698 --> 05:31.899
-Captain.
-Yeah.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.701
We've locked in on her GPS.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.569
-Let me see.
-There's been no movement.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.371
BOBBY:
Okay, Chim, it looks like she's

05:37.405 --> 05:38.839
about three meters deep
over there

05:38.872 --> 05:40.974
inside that pancaked section
of the garage.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.676
If we do this wrong,

05:42.710 --> 05:45.546
We risk bringing the rest of
this down on top of her.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.180
So we go slow.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.082
But not too slow.
She's in there, Chim.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.283
Roger that.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.522
BUCK:
That's it. You're doing great.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.990
You've, uh, you've
done this before, haven't you?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.727
ALI:
Yeah. It was, uh, my major

05:59.760 --> 06:01.629
at the Rhode Island
School of Design.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.834
Sorry.
Sarcasm is my fallback

06:06.867 --> 06:08.436
for pretty much everything.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.572
BUCK:
I totally get it.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.474
-I got you.
-Okay.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.113
You think he'll still be
on the sidewalk

06:20.147 --> 06:21.449
when we get down there?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.185
No.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.622
And we're not going out
that side, anyway.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.290
EDDIE:
Let's hustle up, you two.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.092
We don't want to be here
for the next aftershock.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.795
Wait, what do you mean,
the next aftershock?

06:34.828 --> 06:37.097
Come on.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.336
-(groans)
-There we go.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.440
-You're gonna be fine.
-Oh!

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
You're gonna be fine.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.478
He's right behind you.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.245
ALI:
Okay.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.757
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.759
We're not getting out this way.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.462
Now what?

07:12.766 --> 07:13.967
We go back up.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.302
Back up?

07:15.335 --> 07:16.904
BOBBY (over comm):
Ladder 118, respond.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.806
This is Captain Nash.
I need a head count.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.342
Ladder 118 responding.
Diaz, Buckley, we're good, Cap.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.579
WOMAN (over comm):
Castillo and Jackson responding.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.615
MAN:
Paulson, Marcus
and Riley responding.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.951
CHIMNEY:
Chimney responding.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.886
BOBBY:
Hen, do you copy? Hen?

07:35.355 --> 07:38.158
This is Captain Nash for
Henrietta Wilson. Do you copy?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.960
Is that a friend of yours?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.364
Let's keep moving.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.709
(grunting)

08:02.550 --> 08:04.384
HEN:
Bobby!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.655
Buck, Chim?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.791
Help! Bobby! Buck!

08:10.824 --> 08:13.661
(grunts)

08:15.529 --> 08:17.865
(grunting, panting)

08:19.232 --> 08:21.301
Hey, anybody down here?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.503
(man groans)

08:25.105 --> 08:27.541
Hey! Hello?

08:27.575 --> 08:28.742
(man groans)

08:28.776 --> 08:31.211
(Hen grunting)

08:39.753 --> 08:41.421
221, right?

08:41.454 --> 08:43.223
Yeah. Russ.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.392
Hen. 118.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.095
Where... Where's your radio,
Russ? Mine is toast.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.931
I don't have one.
All radios were issued out.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.499
It's not my shift.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.102
Oh, my God, you came in
on your day off, Russ?

08:55.135 --> 08:58.005
Yeah.
Nothing new on Netflix.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.607
(weak laugh)

08:59.640 --> 09:01.208
(grunting)

09:06.413 --> 09:08.381
(cries out)

09:11.118 --> 09:13.921
(straining)

09:13.954 --> 09:15.923
All right,
there's got to be a jack

09:15.956 --> 09:19.593
in one of these cars.
All right.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.562
RUSS:
Don't waste your strength
or your time.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.065
(grunts) None of that, Russ.
We're both getting out of here.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.434
-Okay?
-I'm not.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.969
Fractured pelvis,

09:29.002 --> 09:31.639
flail chest--

09:31.672 --> 09:33.473
even I couldn't save me, and...

09:33.506 --> 09:36.476
you don't know me, but I'm good.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.111
Yeah?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.512
-Well, maybe I'm better.
-Yeah?

09:42.482 --> 09:44.652
(coughing)

09:47.020 --> 09:48.455
Hold on.
Hang in there, Russ.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.223
Hang in there.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.826
I'm not gonna
make it 20 minutes.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.628
Help's not coming.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.631
Not in time, anyway.
So, please, my kit.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.667
The morphine.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.802
Give me a bolus.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.804
Oh, give me three.
(gasping)

10:06.273 --> 10:08.909
I'll give you one,
just to keep you comfortable,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.878
but we're not giving up, okay?

10:13.714 --> 10:14.948
You married, Hen?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.084
I am.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.786
I hope you make it back
to your husband.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.254
Wife.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.791
Oh, yeah?
I had one of those.

10:23.824 --> 10:28.328
She was always worrying
that I wouldn't...

10:28.361 --> 10:30.530
make it back home
to see her.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.766
Decided maybe it's better
if I just

10:32.800 --> 10:34.802
stopped coming home altogether.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.971
I think maybe she was...

10:38.005 --> 10:40.273
onto something.
(gasps)

10:40.307 --> 10:43.376
My people are
right above us, okay?

10:43.410 --> 10:46.646
Believe me when I tell you...

10:48.348 --> 10:49.883
Russ?

10:49.917 --> 10:52.485
Russ!

10:52.519 --> 10:54.521
Damn it.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.548
All right.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.717
It looks like we are
in pretty good shape.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.518
No structural damage.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.155
But that sprinkler system--
man, that's another story.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.058
REPORTER:
...reports are still coming in
about possible casualties

11:31.091 --> 11:34.862
caused by the 7.1 earthquake
that hit Southern California.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.930
This is an
unprecedented emergency

11:36.964 --> 11:39.666
-that has swept across...
-Oh, come on. Hey, you guys,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.735
I thought you were
cleaning up this mess.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.371
-The damage is widespread...
-We wanted to watch the news.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.841
Oh, speaking of
unprecedented events. Wow.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.609
..but at this point
we are urging everyone

11:49.642 --> 11:53.180
who's able to watch this:
please stay where you are.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.348
-That is...
-(sighs) Okay.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.350
I asked you guys
to clean up the mess

11:57.384 --> 11:58.952
and go through
the earthquake kits.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.621
Go do that now, please.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.091
You just said
the house was fine.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.592
Why do you care

12:05.625 --> 12:06.960
about those books more than Mom?

12:08.996 --> 12:12.099
What did you just say to me?

12:15.836 --> 12:18.806
Listen...

12:18.839 --> 12:21.408
I have been worrying
about your mom

12:21.441 --> 12:23.476
since before you were born.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.046
That just goes
with the territory.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.216
But she is out there
doing her job

12:29.249 --> 12:31.051
just like she does every day,

12:31.084 --> 12:35.255
so we are not going to imagine
the worst-case scenario.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.424
We're gonna have faith
that she's okay

12:37.457 --> 12:38.926
and be happy to see her

12:38.959 --> 12:40.593
when she comes home.
Do you understand?

12:40.627 --> 12:44.331
But today's not
like every other day, Dad.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.807
Okay. Let's go.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.409
-Where?
-Get a sweater.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.979
And the earthquake kits.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.747
Are we gonna go look for Mom?

13:00.780 --> 13:04.351
You guys got five seconds
to get in the car.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.132
(indistinct shouting)

13:19.166 --> 13:20.333
(gunshot)

13:20.367 --> 13:22.202
(sirens wailing)

13:22.235 --> 13:24.471
MAN:
Take it easy.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.540
LAPD. I need
everyone to back up.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.943
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.145
We ain't the ones shooting.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.954
Thank God.
These people are crazy.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.023
-You have a license for that?
-Yes, ma'am.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.524
I have all the paperwork
in the back.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.127
I can't expect you people
to be here all the time.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.562
All right, well, we're here now.
Tell me what's going on.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.299
Exactly what it looks like.
They tried to loot my store.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.235
I thought the people in this
neighborhood were decent folk,

13:55.268 --> 13:57.337
but apparently
they think everything's free

13:57.370 --> 13:58.939
if an earthquake hits.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.210
Mm-hmm.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.381
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Hey, Joe, looters--

14:08.415 --> 14:11.351
they tend to bring stuff they
want to steal to the register,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.020
do they?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.155
-I brought that stuff here.
-And when was that?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.823
After you popped off
your shotgun,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.325
you decided to tidy up a bit?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.693
How much you charging
for that case of water?

14:20.727 --> 14:22.229
$14.99.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.830
Liar.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.498
OFFICER:
Step back, ma'am.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.434
ATHENA:
Hey, miss,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.402
how much was this man charging
you for a case of water?

14:29.436 --> 14:31.071
A hundred dollars.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.441
Supply and demand.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.443
Are you familiar
with penal code 396,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.378
the anti-price gouging law?

14:38.411 --> 14:42.015
It specifically states
that jackasses like yourself

14:42.049 --> 14:44.117
are prohibited from raising
the price of consumer goods

14:44.151 --> 14:45.752
by more than ten percent

14:45.785 --> 14:48.721
after a state of emergency
has been declared.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.058
Was a state of emergency
officially declared?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.893
The San Andreas Fault declared
one just before lunch today.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.562
You may have noticed.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.965
Look, if I don't
raise the price,

14:57.998 --> 15:00.300
two or three people
will buy it all.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.536
Upping the cost ensures
that everyone gets a shot.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.405
Oh, so you're just thinking
of your fellow man

15:05.438 --> 15:06.773
when you decided to fleece them.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.108
Well, not today.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.576
These people were not intruders.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.444
The sign on your door
says "open,"

15:11.478 --> 15:12.879
and you are not their victim.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.481
Quite the opposite,
by the looks of things.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.085
Now, there are people
in real need.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.919
This city is under
serious distress,

15:19.953 --> 15:23.223
and all you can think about
is padding your own pockets.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.127
-I have a right...
-So, you have got yourself
a choice.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.663
I can write you up
for price gouging

15:30.697 --> 15:33.800
and you can face
a year in jail, or...

15:33.833 --> 15:37.304
we can overlook
your ignorance of the law,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.440
and maybe we can come up
with some other arrangement.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.575
Like what?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.012
Oh, like, you tell me.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.617
(sighs)

15:50.650 --> 15:54.454
I guess I could, I don't know,
like you said,

15:54.487 --> 15:56.856
raise the prices slightly.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.691
Ten percent?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.398
Ten percent off?

16:08.335 --> 16:10.337
20 percent.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.243
50 percent off
everything in the store.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.848
Now, that's more like it.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.818
Okay, folks,
it's half-price day!

16:25.852 --> 16:27.854
(cheering, applause)

16:30.523 --> 16:32.525
(indistinct chatter)

16:43.770 --> 16:46.773
Pleasure doing business
with you.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.748
Hi. LAFD?

16:55.782 --> 16:56.883
BILL:
That's right.
Bill Jenks, liaison.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.885
Maddie Buckley.
Crazy day.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.153
Do you have any idea
what's going on

17:00.187 --> 17:01.654
at the Hollywood Palm Hotel?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.323
Pretty much just
what's been on the news.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.558
It's a mess. Aftershock
caused another collapse.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.194
We've got some people missing.

17:07.227 --> 17:11.030
Well, I think that my brother
might be in that hotel.

17:11.064 --> 17:15.034
Do you know if any
of the missing are from the 118?

17:15.068 --> 17:17.870
I don't. I'm sorry.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.906
If I hear anything else,
I'll come find you.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.313
(whispers):
Oh, please be okay.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.455
(grunting)

17:35.488 --> 17:38.225
Here you go.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.260
There you go. Easy.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.363
Miss, there's this egress on the
north stairwell of this floor.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
ALI:
What if it's blocked, too?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.567
Can't you guys get a ladder
into one of the windows?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.469
It's too risky.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.903
Building shifted too much.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.372
No, we got this, Abby.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.773
We'll get you out of here.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.475
Ali.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.909
What?

17:56.943 --> 17:59.979
You called me Abby.
My name's Ali.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.614
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

18:01.648 --> 18:06.486
Um, Abby is my...
It's complicated.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.888
Isn't it always?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.558
BUCK:
Uh, she's in Europe.
She's traveling.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.461
For the first time,
I'm glad she's not around.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.596
-I don't need the worry.
-(grunts)

18:16.629 --> 18:18.631
(sighs)

18:21.033 --> 18:23.736
Having someone
to worry about sounds...

18:23.770 --> 18:26.439
nice, actually.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.475
All I do is work.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.813
What?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.848
It's after 5:00.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.653
It's not like it slowed us down.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.855
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
-BATARI: Is anyone there?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.459
You guys hear that?

18:46.493 --> 18:50.197
Help!
Is anyone there?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.031
(Batari groans)

19:00.373 --> 19:02.442
I knew help would come.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.612
EDDIE:
That's right. We're here,
we got you, buddy.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.947
All right, don't move.
Just relax, okay?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.949
I need you to stay
as still as possible.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.784
Okay, we got to roll him over.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.720
On three. One, two, three.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.488
(screams)

19:17.524 --> 19:20.159
I... uh, I soiled myself.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.495
Forget about that, okay?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.063
BATARI:
Not my proudest moment.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.267
(groaning)

19:31.938 --> 19:34.173
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.424
Numbness in his legs,
loss of bladder control.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.426
Spinal injury.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.495
We got to move him out now.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.230
On what?
We don't have a backboard,

19:57.264 --> 19:58.898
and every millimeter counts.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.035
You see anything?

20:03.069 --> 20:05.772
Guys. What about this?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.607
Ironing board.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.380
Could work, but how are we gonna
get him down the stairwell?

20:13.413 --> 20:17.116
Maybe we don't use
the stairwell.

20:22.088 --> 20:26.459
At least we're not
blocked by any debris.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.495
Or an elevator.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.503
ALI:
Um, how much
do you think that weighs?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.674
2,500. 3,000 pounds?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.777
I like our chances.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.413
Yeah.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.481
(grunts)

20:53.085 --> 20:55.087
(shouts)

21:08.668 --> 21:11.838
(shouts)

21:11.871 --> 21:13.272
Damn it.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.308
(panting)

21:45.505 --> 21:46.539
(beep)

22:00.420 --> 22:03.790
Uh, hey, babe,
it's, uh, it's me.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.627
I, um...

22:07.660 --> 22:11.598
listen, I just-I just wanted
to say that I, uh...

22:15.234 --> 22:17.236
(cries)

22:20.272 --> 22:22.742
I wish I could promise you
that I was coming home tonight,

22:22.775 --> 22:25.378
but, um...

22:25.412 --> 22:27.313
after you took me back,
you know,

22:27.346 --> 22:29.616
I-I swore that I would
never lie to you again.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.221
And, baby, it's, uh...

22:35.254 --> 22:38.791
it's not looking
too good for me right now.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.439
I love you.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.277
I love you and
I love Denny so much.

22:59.446 --> 23:02.615
And, uh, and whatever happens...

23:06.252 --> 23:07.687
...I just need you to know

23:07.720 --> 23:11.724
that... that I didn't
give up, okay?

23:11.758 --> 23:14.193
That I fought.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.464
I fought to the end.
I fought.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.633
I fought to come home
to you, okay?

23:25.337 --> 23:27.339
(beep)

23:53.633 --> 23:55.134
(shouts)

23:55.167 --> 23:58.771
(grunting)

24:12.785 --> 24:14.153
(barking)

24:14.186 --> 24:17.757
Hey. Hey.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.459
Lassie, go get help.

24:20.493 --> 24:23.129
Okay.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.031
Knock it off.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.000
Paisley.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.937
Okay, Paisley,
show me the way out.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.540
All right.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.045
(barking)

24:49.155 --> 24:52.358
MAY:
I didn't know our church
even did this.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.193
Yeah, a lot of people
are in need right now.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.063
Not everybody got by
with just broken glass

24:57.096 --> 24:58.898
and an overturned bookshelf.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.838
Mom's not here.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.674
No, she isn't.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.009
Then why are we?

25:10.042 --> 25:12.579
To be of service. Okay?

25:14.681 --> 25:16.148
-Hey. (laughs)
-Grants.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.550
How good to see you.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.051
Hi, Ms. Lorna.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.220
Hey, come here. Mmm.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.825
Harry.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.493
Athena working, is she?

25:27.526 --> 25:30.096
Oh, yeah, she is.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.331
You know I'm gonna
put y'all to work.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.900
-And that's why we're here.
-All right.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.102
Come on. (chuckles)

25:36.135 --> 25:38.137
(indistinct chatter)

25:45.477 --> 25:47.446
Thank you.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.123
Are you okay?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.358
Mom said church.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.528
That's where to go
when things go bad.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.197
So you're looking for your mom?

26:05.231 --> 26:09.268
Wait here until she finds me.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.470
She might not be able
to find you under here.

26:11.503 --> 26:14.140
Why don't we go wait over there?

26:14.173 --> 26:16.943
You could still see the doors.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.444
And I'll wait with you.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.183
I'm worried about my mom, too.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.393
MS. LORNA:
You and Athena have done
such a good job with them.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.563
They are wonderful children.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.931
MICHAEL:
They take after their mother.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.132
(Ms. Lorna chuckles)

26:40.166 --> 26:42.068
I give you some of the credit.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.436
Eh.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.839
You're worried.

26:51.610 --> 26:55.314
We haven't been able
to reach Athena all day.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.787
I'm trying to stay strong
for the kids.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.524
You know, keep them
out of their head.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.927
(chuckles)
Well...

27:07.960 --> 27:10.529
may I pray with you?

27:10.562 --> 27:12.699
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.734
Come on.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.845
How you doing, Batari?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.316
How you feeling?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.451
Not dead yet.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.886
Yeah.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.387
You guys are doing great.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.889
You're almost there.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.425
Eight more feet, Buck.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.999
All right.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.670
Get down here, Buck.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.741
All right, on my way.
You ready?

27:54.774 --> 27:57.009
-Okay.
-All right.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.619
-You're okay. You're okay.
-Okay. Okay.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.561
(rumbling)

28:15.594 --> 28:17.864
Is the building vibrating?

28:21.734 --> 28:23.235
(Ali shouts)

28:25.604 --> 28:27.006
Eddie! Eddie,
kick that door open!

28:27.039 --> 28:28.340
I got you, okay?

28:28.374 --> 28:30.376
(screams)

28:32.879 --> 28:34.280
Cover!

28:42.922 --> 28:45.557
-Let's go, Buck! Move your ass!
-All right, here we come.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.159
-Here we come!
-Aah!

28:49.661 --> 28:51.330
(elevator crashes)

28:52.631 --> 28:53.800
(panting)

28:55.401 --> 28:57.603
I told you I liked our chances.

28:57.636 --> 29:00.406
(indistinct chatter)

29:00.439 --> 29:02.474
-Cap, you good?
-BOBBY: I'm good.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.044
You good?

29:05.077 --> 29:07.113
We're good.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.986
Now we're back
to where we started.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.955
BOBBY:
All right, well, we start again.

29:15.988 --> 29:19.591
Captain Nash,
Firefighter Wilson's GPS.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.561
There's been movement.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.231
Chim, look at this.
She's on the other side of us.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.967
Yeah, she's on the move,
but where's she going?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.604
(barking)

29:32.638 --> 29:34.640
Paisley, where'd you go?

29:34.673 --> 29:37.109
(barking)

29:49.221 --> 29:51.023
Kat?

29:51.057 --> 29:53.993
Oh, my God. I've been
looking for you, baby.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.195
Are you hurt?

29:56.228 --> 29:58.865
No, but I fell.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.499
Yeah, me, too.

30:00.532 --> 30:03.702
(chuckles)
Here, look.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.073
Look what I got.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.378
There you go.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.513
That's much better.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.017
Come on.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.694
BOBBY:
Pillars in the south side of
the garage haven't collapsed,

30:28.727 --> 30:29.695
so she must've found
a pocket of space

30:29.728 --> 30:30.729
in there and moved through.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.198
South side
of the parking garage?

30:32.231 --> 30:34.633
Yeah. We've been attacking this
from the wrong angle.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.202
We're gonna head south.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.138
All right? South side
of the parking garage.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.540
This is Captain Nash.
We are on the move.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.741
I need jackhammers,
diamond saws, jaws,

30:42.774 --> 30:44.010
every heavy duty
piece of equipment

30:44.043 --> 30:46.345
you have and every available
pair of hands.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.347
We are going down to the
southern corner of the garage,

30:48.380 --> 30:50.349
level B3.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.984
MIRANDA (over radio):
Negative, Captain.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.686
Engineers have warned of
a possible complete collapse.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.756
We need to begin the evacuation.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.426
No can do. We still have
a firefighter trapped down here.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.860
I'm sorry. I understand.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.295
This is a direct order.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.399
All right, guys, evacuate.
Come on.

31:07.433 --> 31:08.834
Double-time. Let's go.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.502
Everybody out. Come on.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.238
Up and out, guys.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.539
Get up to safety.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.707
Up and out. Let's go, let's go.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.944
Cap, we can't leave Hen behind.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.046
She'd be here till the end
if it were one of us.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.014
I know.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.751
I can't ask anyone else
to defy a direct order.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.794
Why are the first responders
leaving the building?

31:35.827 --> 31:36.795
-Our daughter's still in there.
-I'm sorry.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.630
I'm going back in.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.266
Sir...

31:40.299 --> 31:43.802
-No! No! No!
-Got to go back, sir.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.005
Let me in there!

31:49.075 --> 31:50.542
CHIMNEY:
So have you given much thought

31:50.576 --> 31:52.478
to what you'll do
after we're fired?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.646
BOBBY:
We were ordered
to leave the building.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.815
We're just leaving
a different way.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.986
-Yeah, by taking a detour to the
bottom of the parking garage?
-Yeah.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.453
It's a choice.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.789
BOBBY:
Watch your step.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.258
Hen? Hen.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.094
CHIMNEY:
Hen, can you hear us?

32:08.127 --> 32:10.562
Think that ramp is
on the other side of this wall?

32:10.596 --> 32:14.466
Yeah.
Should be right over there.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.103
Whoa.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.841
So the only thing that stands
between us and Hen is that.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.644
We're gonna make it through
this, Chim, just you and me,

32:25.677 --> 32:27.246
without any help
or heavy equipment.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.116
Piece of cake.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.852
All right,
let's see what we can find.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.287
Copy that.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.590
-Chim.
-(car alarms wailing)

32:38.624 --> 32:41.060
Get the valet.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.296
See what we got.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.133
-All right.
-All right.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.667
BOBBY:
All right, scoop 'em up.
Let's go.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.038
All right, let's see
what we got here.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.008
(alarm chirps)

32:58.144 --> 33:01.013
-Got one, Cap.
-All right. Keep going.

33:02.881 --> 33:06.118
All right, got a jack, tools.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.987
CHIMNEY:
Got another one.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.756
All right, see what
you can find, Chim.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.695
CHIMNEY:
Got a toolbox, a jack.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.200
BOBBY:
Got some rope here.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.235
(alarm chirps)

33:27.673 --> 33:30.709
-Cap.
-Yeah?

33:30.742 --> 33:32.878
You got to see this.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.850
Thinking what I'm thinking?

33:38.884 --> 33:40.552
BOBBY:
Snow chains.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.423
(engine starts)

33:52.030 --> 33:53.932
All right.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.071
All right, Chim,
ease it forward.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.178
It's coming.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.314
You're good.
Keep going, Chim.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.518
How we looking?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.486
Looking good.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.627
What happened?

34:21.660 --> 34:22.761
Chain snapped.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.299
-We have any more chain?
-No.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.468
But I think it's far enough out
that we can get back behind it

34:29.501 --> 34:31.237
and push it out
the rest of the way.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.739
BUCK:
Looks like we got here
just in time, then.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.374
Yeah, seems like
they were planning

34:35.407 --> 34:36.808
on having all the fun
without us.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.477
Heard over the radio
you needed some equipment

34:38.510 --> 34:40.546
and available hands down here.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.648
You know you guys
are disobeying a direct order.

34:44.650 --> 34:48.487
And they'll be duly reprimanded,
as soon as we're done here.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.557
Looks like you're gonna have to
reprimand yourself, as well.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.925
I'm seriously considering it.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.995
Your people are very persuasive
and persistent.

34:57.028 --> 34:59.865
One shot, Captain.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.968
Either way,

35:03.001 --> 35:04.436
no one's coming to rescue us.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.442
(indistinct chatter)

35:13.645 --> 35:16.648
Keep going, Chim,
we got to get it clear.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.461
It's clear now.
We need some support beams.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.497
(indistinct chatter continuing)

35:38.170 --> 35:40.105
-You got her?
-Straight ahead, straight ahead.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.040
There you go.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.375
MAN:
Clear the rubble.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.816
(grunts)
Get up there.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.085
Three, two, one.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.231
(barking)

36:05.264 --> 36:06.665
BUCK:
Hen?

36:06.698 --> 36:10.336
Hen, are you there?

36:15.574 --> 36:17.142
MAN:
Coming out, guys.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.212
-Come on.
-Hey, fellas. (coughs)

36:20.246 --> 36:22.013
-All right, let's
get you out of here.
-Come on.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.584
-Down here, we got you.
-(grunting)

36:25.617 --> 36:27.619
(indistinct chatter)

36:30.922 --> 36:32.924
Watch your step.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.562
(laughing)

37:00.786 --> 37:02.788
Hollywood Palm's been evacuated.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.891
All members of the 118
are safe and accounted for.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.261
Thank you.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.963
Thank you.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.138
911. What is your emergency?

37:20.171 --> 37:22.040
WOMAN:
There's this weird
light in the sky,

37:22.073 --> 37:23.409
like a glowing cloud.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.110
Did something else happen?

37:25.143 --> 37:26.878
A glowing cloud...

37:26.912 --> 37:30.248
W... Wait, is there power
where you are?

37:30.282 --> 37:32.618
No power here.
Not a light for miles.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.353
Is everything okay?

37:35.621 --> 37:39.425
I think what you're seeing
is the Milky Way.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.961
The city's usually so bright
you're not able to see it.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.397
Oh, geez.
(chuckles)

37:45.431 --> 37:46.798
Well, now I feel...

37:46.832 --> 37:48.500
Sorry to bother you.

37:48.534 --> 37:51.670
You must be pretty busy there.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.405
It's been a day.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.341
Well, thank you.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.675
All of you.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.884
*

38:20.799 --> 38:22.334
* I

38:23.869 --> 38:26.505
* I wish you could swim

38:29.408 --> 38:32.143
* Like the dolphins

38:32.177 --> 38:34.813
* Like dolphins can swim

38:38.016 --> 38:40.018
* Though nothing

38:40.051 --> 38:43.054
* Nothing will
keep us together *

38:45.724 --> 38:48.960
* We can beat them

38:48.994 --> 38:51.897
* Forever and ever

38:53.832 --> 38:57.969
* Oh, we can be heroes

38:58.003 --> 39:00.806
* Just for one day

39:00.839 --> 39:02.608
(mouthing)

39:20.859 --> 39:23.929
* I

39:23.962 --> 39:25.964
* I will be king

39:28.366 --> 39:31.570
* And you

39:31.603 --> 39:33.238
* You will be queen

39:37.609 --> 39:39.911
-* Though nothing...
-(phone buzzing)

39:39.945 --> 39:42.448
Hey. Service.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.954
* We can be heroes

39:48.987 --> 39:51.823
* Just for one day

39:54.092 --> 39:57.763
* We can be us

39:57.796 --> 40:00.065
* Just for one day

40:03.401 --> 40:06.237
* I

40:06.271 --> 40:08.774
* I can remember

40:08.807 --> 40:12.210
* I remember *

40:12.243 --> 40:16.314
* Standing

40:16.347 --> 40:17.816
* By the wall

40:17.849 --> 40:20.786
* By the wall *

40:20.819 --> 40:24.322
* And the guns

40:24.355 --> 40:26.391
* Shot above our heads

40:26.424 --> 40:28.827
* Over our heads *

40:28.860 --> 40:32.063
* And we kissed

40:32.097 --> 40:35.133
* As though nothing could fall

40:35.166 --> 40:37.636
* Nothing could fall *

40:37.669 --> 40:41.507
* And the shame

40:41.540 --> 40:44.042
* Was on the other side

40:45.777 --> 40:49.414
* Oh, we can beat them

40:49.447 --> 40:52.450
* Forever and ever

40:53.985 --> 40:58.490
* Then we could be heroes

40:58.524 --> 41:00.992
* Just for one day

41:06.832 --> 41:09.835
* We can be heroes

41:15.373 --> 41:18.710
* We can be heroes

41:24.049 --> 41:25.884
* We can be heroes.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.553
Smells good.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.788
(chuckles)
Well, you know how I do.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.357
-(phone rings)
-(chuckles) Oh.

41:37.262 --> 41:40.666
Hey. How's my man?

41:40.699 --> 41:42.333
BOBBY:
I need to see you.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.002
(chuckles)

41:44.035 --> 41:46.471
I need to see you, too,
but I have to feed these kids

41:46.504 --> 41:48.473
and the roads are still a mess.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.576
I need to see you.
Can you come out front?

41:51.910 --> 41:54.079
(hangs up)

42:07.258 --> 42:09.695
You came all this way
just to see me?

42:09.728 --> 42:11.029
I would've walked if I had to.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.064
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.203
You know what? I thought about
knocking on the door,

42:18.236 --> 42:19.437
but I figured that
wasn't the best way

42:19.470 --> 42:20.939
for your kids to meet me
the first time.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.609
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's probably wise.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.076
How was your day, honey?

42:26.077 --> 42:30.448
Oh, pretty standard.

42:30.481 --> 42:31.717
I like your outfit.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.119
(chuckles)

42:35.821 --> 42:39.190
I was worried about you all day.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.693
Yeah, I was worried
about you, too.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.261
It was nice

42:43.294 --> 42:45.096
having something so important
to worry about.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.633
I had to work hard to put it
aside to get the job done.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.434
I haven't had that
in a long time.

42:49.467 --> 42:51.937
Excuse me,

42:51.970 --> 42:54.405
what is all of this silliness?

42:54.439 --> 42:56.608
Hi. I'm-I'm Bobby.

42:56.642 --> 42:59.444
We met a while back
at Hen's party.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.146
-Of course.
-Yeah,

43:01.179 --> 43:03.014
Bobby just came to check on me.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.385
And you have him
standing out here

43:07.418 --> 43:09.320
after the day he's probably had.

43:09.354 --> 43:11.957
-Bobby, please, come inside.
-Uh, no, thank you,

43:11.990 --> 43:14.793
but maybe another time.

43:14.826 --> 43:16.828
Nonsense.
I already set your plate.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.730
And, uh...

43:18.764 --> 43:21.566
the kids are excited
to meet you.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.269
(mouths)

43:24.302 --> 43:26.304
-(sighs)
-Um...

43:28.473 --> 43:30.475
(Athena chuckles)

43:32.811 --> 43:34.813

Media Access Group at WGBH

44:17.689 --> 44:19.557
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.860
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.864
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.535
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:30.568 --> 44:34.139
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:34.172 --> 44:37.709
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:37.743 --> 44:38.744
MAN: Touchdown!

44:38.777 --> 44:42.347
* Reach out *

44:42.380 --> 44:45.984
* Make this right here
right now *

44:46.017 --> 44:48.920
* Stand up *

44:49.788 --> 44:51.556
* Here right now *

44:51.589 --> 44:53.558
That sounds like fun.
