WEBVTT

00:02.273 --> 00:04.573
Attention, citizens of the Internet.

00:04.575 --> 00:07.709
We are calling upon
every able-bodied viewer

00:07.711 --> 00:11.564
for another adrenalized
tour of duty for Shay's Army.

00:11.566 --> 00:12.789
I am General Shay.

00:12.791 --> 00:14.382
And I am Major Mitch.

00:14.384 --> 00:16.283
- And I'm Jess...
- Shut the hell up, Jessie.

00:16.286 --> 00:17.752
Seriously, no one's gonna recognize you.

00:17.754 --> 00:19.654
Not without a microwave
cemented on your head.

00:19.656 --> 00:22.023
We're coming to you
live from Hacienda Park

00:22.025 --> 00:24.993
where we have a stunt so daring...

00:24.995 --> 00:27.195
A video so bold...

00:27.197 --> 00:28.669
- It might...
- Just...

00:28.671 --> 00:30.871
Break the Internet!

00:30.873 --> 00:34.207
We're about to turn
this merry-go-round...

00:34.209 --> 00:36.810
Into a scary-go-round.

00:38.147 --> 00:40.313
Oh.

00:40.315 --> 00:43.249
Daddy likes. Whoo!

00:43.251 --> 00:44.684
Jessie, you ready to take a ride

00:44.686 --> 00:47.383
into infinity and beyond?

00:47.385 --> 00:48.474
Perfect.

00:48.476 --> 00:51.404
- Ready, set...
- Spin.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.033
Look at him go. It's beautiful.

01:11.645 --> 01:14.246
Oh, you're really burning rubber.

01:18.519 --> 01:20.352
- Whoa!
- Oh. Oh.

01:20.354 --> 01:22.287
Yo, shut him down, man.

01:29.463 --> 01:31.062
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:31.064 --> 01:32.130
Not again!

01:32.132 --> 01:33.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34.470 --> 01:36.092
_

01:36.094 --> 01:40.410
_

01:40.412 --> 01:42.375
_

01:44.778 --> 01:47.446
So what, now they
got self-driving motorcycles?

01:47.448 --> 01:48.937
Wouldn't that defeat the point?

01:48.939 --> 01:50.261
That rider couldn't have gone far.

01:50.263 --> 01:52.851
Buck, Eddie, hose that
down and turn that bike off.

01:57.957 --> 01:59.156
Think I saw Christopher

01:59.158 --> 02:01.191
watching a video like this online.

02:01.193 --> 02:03.127
That bike wasn't on fire.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.795
Hey, can you hear me?

02:04.797 --> 02:06.130
Oh! Oh.

02:06.132 --> 02:07.331
Uh...

02:07.333 --> 02:08.853
All right, let's get him off of there.

02:15.642 --> 02:17.475
His pupils are extremely dilated.

02:17.477 --> 02:19.977
Globe luxation in both eyes

02:19.979 --> 02:21.312
causing them to bulge out.

02:21.314 --> 02:22.846
Blood pressure's off the charts.

02:22.848 --> 02:25.216
- Starting a line.
- Albert, what happened to him?

02:25.218 --> 02:26.317
Depending on how many times

02:26.319 --> 02:28.152
he was spinning around like
that, it could be G-lock.

02:28.154 --> 02:30.032
G-force poisoning from
the force of the spin?

02:30.034 --> 02:32.790
Right now, all his blood
is pooling inside his head.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.024
It's pressing against his brain.

02:34.026 --> 02:35.693
That's why he's out cold.

02:35.695 --> 02:37.968
We don't get that swelling
down, he could have a stroke.

02:37.970 --> 02:40.164
We've gotta get him stable
enough for transport.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.239
Running isotonic fluids.

02:42.241 --> 02:44.675
Wait, I feel like I know this guy.

02:44.677 --> 02:46.777
All right, BP's stabilizing.

02:46.779 --> 02:48.545
Administering numbing drops.

02:48.547 --> 02:50.380
I'll hold back the curtains

02:50.382 --> 02:53.951
while you show these
guests to their seats.

02:53.953 --> 02:57.221
All right.

02:57.223 --> 02:59.656
Here you go.

03:07.161 --> 03:08.516
Cap, we're good here.

03:08.518 --> 03:10.090
All right, let's get
him up and transported

03:10.092 --> 03:12.436
to the nearest
neurosurgery trauma center.

03:12.438 --> 03:14.939
I can see. Thank you.

03:14.941 --> 03:16.140
Who did this to you?

03:18.009 --> 03:19.109
Oh, I have an idea.

03:22.380 --> 03:25.181
You think Jessie's okay?
He looks really messed up.

03:25.183 --> 03:26.616
I'm sure he's fine.

03:26.618 --> 03:28.384
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

03:28.386 --> 03:30.887
Afraid you're gonna be
otherwise occupied.

03:30.889 --> 03:34.023
You're under arrest for
trespassing, vandalism,

03:34.025 --> 03:37.326
reckless endangerment,
and disturbing the peace.

03:37.328 --> 03:39.129
- You can't prove anything.
- Don't need to.

03:39.131 --> 03:42.639
You fools livestreamed your
confession on the Internet.

03:42.641 --> 03:44.067
Hey, guys. Remember us?

03:44.069 --> 03:46.522
You've gotta be kidding
me. How small is this town?

03:46.524 --> 03:48.438
Don't think you're posting
that without our permission.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.073
Yeah, even if you did,

03:50.075 --> 03:51.507
just gonna get us more followers.

03:51.509 --> 03:53.243
Nah, this is just for
an audience of one.

03:56.681 --> 04:00.182
Man, I really need new friends.

04:13.184 --> 04:16.184

04:18.935 --> 04:20.303
Oh, I know that smile.

04:21.406 --> 04:23.172
Pair of aces.

04:30.281 --> 04:31.480
Flush.

04:31.482 --> 04:33.349
- Oh!
- Yes!

04:33.351 --> 04:34.550
He falls for it every time.

04:34.552 --> 04:36.184
How does this keep on happening?

04:36.186 --> 04:37.819
Because you suck at poker.

04:37.821 --> 04:40.355
Spoken by someone who
also sucks at poker.

04:40.357 --> 04:42.757
No judgment, but maybe you
should quit while you're behind.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.025
Wow.

04:44.027 --> 04:46.361
Who needs more wine? Kay.

04:46.363 --> 04:48.029
I'm gonna need something stronger.

04:48.031 --> 04:50.131
Thanks again for
having me. This was fun.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.700
For some of us.

04:51.702 --> 04:53.267
Well, all our couple friends were busy,

04:53.269 --> 04:55.437
so we figured we would target solos.

04:55.439 --> 04:58.005
If I didn't know better, I'd
say you were setting us up.

04:58.007 --> 05:00.174
Oh, no, I like you way too much
to set you up with my brother.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.209
Uh, hey now.

05:01.211 --> 05:02.977
And I love you too much

05:02.979 --> 05:04.646
to let you keep being

05:04.648 --> 05:08.015
so incredibly, tragically...

05:08.017 --> 05:09.651
Some might say embarrassingly.

05:09.653 --> 05:11.152
Single.

05:11.154 --> 05:12.687
Tragic seems a bit much.

05:12.689 --> 05:14.356
Closest you've gotten
to turning on a woman

05:14.358 --> 05:16.980
in the past few months is
shouting out, "Hey, Siri!"

05:16.982 --> 05:18.425
Well, she's very good to me.

05:18.427 --> 05:20.719
She sings me songs,
she delivers me food,

05:20.721 --> 05:23.611
she tells me where to be,
when, and how to get there,

05:23.613 --> 05:24.879
and that is pretty much love.

05:24.881 --> 05:26.581
- The rest I...
- Ew, no!

05:26.583 --> 05:28.316
Oh, no, no, no. Dear
God, I don't wanna know.

05:28.318 --> 05:31.153
All right, all right,
just ease up on the solos.

05:31.155 --> 05:32.254
It's hard out here.

05:32.256 --> 05:33.922
See? Thank you.

05:33.924 --> 05:35.323
It's LA.

05:35.325 --> 05:37.526
Everybody's always in their car

05:37.528 --> 05:39.794
or looking at their phones.

05:39.796 --> 05:41.342
Or in their car looking at their phones.

05:41.344 --> 05:43.365
And we're stuck with
online dating, which is...

05:43.367 --> 05:44.566
An absolute nightmare.

05:44.568 --> 05:46.868
The crazies, the randos, the catfishers,

05:46.870 --> 05:48.836
and not to mention the liars.

05:48.838 --> 05:52.374
Profile pics brought
to you by Photoshop.

05:52.376 --> 05:54.609
Face it, guys. You two got lucky.

05:54.611 --> 05:55.700
They did.

05:55.702 --> 05:59.281
You guys have no idea
how hard it is out there

05:59.283 --> 06:01.015
for the solos.

06:02.418 --> 06:04.251
Mm.

06:04.253 --> 06:05.620
Where's Albert tonight?

06:07.857 --> 06:10.858
He's on a date.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.493
Come on.

06:12.495 --> 06:14.028
Perfect.

06:14.030 --> 06:18.032
Looking for room 203.

06:19.603 --> 06:23.571
Didn't it just go from 201 to 205?

06:23.573 --> 06:25.334
Oh, it's the next one on the left.

06:25.336 --> 06:28.109
Lab classrooms have a different layout.

06:28.111 --> 06:30.812
Of course they do. Thank
you again for coming.

06:30.814 --> 06:32.213
Don't know if I'd be able to navigate

06:32.215 --> 06:33.948
the confusing waters
of parent-teacher night

06:33.950 --> 06:34.983
without you.

06:34.985 --> 06:37.118
Well, knowing these
things is sorta my job.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.820
Okay, follow my lead.

06:38.822 --> 06:41.155
Try to ignore these
teachers' corny jokes.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.058
What jokes?

06:44.060 --> 06:46.260
What do you call a number
that won't sit still?

06:48.063 --> 06:49.563
A roamin' numeral.

06:53.836 --> 06:55.603
How do you make a bandstand?

06:55.605 --> 06:58.239
Take away their chairs!

06:59.475 --> 07:01.308
I don't think he got it.

07:01.310 --> 07:04.044
No, I... I did.

07:04.046 --> 07:06.380
Christopher shows a
great interest in science,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.849
though he does keep
telling other students

07:08.851 --> 07:11.785
tsunamis aren't a big
deal, which is unhelpful.

07:11.787 --> 07:14.321
I'll make sure to
talk to him about that.

07:14.323 --> 07:16.190
Thank you.

07:18.994 --> 07:20.027
No jokes?

07:21.464 --> 07:23.397
I try to tell chemistry jokes,

07:23.399 --> 07:25.098
but there's no reaction.

07:26.001 --> 07:28.834
Get it? No reaction?

07:30.038 --> 07:32.305
Ah, you weren't kidding about the jokes.

07:32.307 --> 07:36.075
Well, hopefully the English
teacher has a better shtick.

07:36.077 --> 07:37.777
So sorry to keep you waiting.

07:37.779 --> 07:39.212
My last student's father asked

07:39.214 --> 07:40.746
a surprising amount of questions.

07:40.748 --> 07:42.081
I'm sure he did.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.849
Good to see you again, Ms. Price.

07:43.851 --> 07:45.285
And you must be Mr. Diaz.

07:45.287 --> 07:47.487
Please, call me Eddie. It's short for...

07:47.489 --> 07:49.322
Edmundo?

07:49.324 --> 07:50.790
Most people guess Eduardo.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.693
Growing up, I had a
grandfather named Edmundo.

07:53.695 --> 07:55.109
He was my favorite.

07:55.111 --> 07:57.564
Mine too. I mean...

07:57.566 --> 07:59.732
So let's talk about Christopher.

07:59.734 --> 08:01.734
He's been doing really well in my class.

08:01.736 --> 08:04.070
His verbal skills have
definitely improved.

08:04.072 --> 08:06.606
He's still a little shy
about reading out loud,

08:06.608 --> 08:09.074
but he definitely
understands the material.

08:09.076 --> 08:11.543
I attribute that to him being
read to from an early age,

08:11.545 --> 08:13.212
so bravo there.

08:13.214 --> 08:15.647
No, we have his mother
to thank for that.

08:15.649 --> 08:17.583
Christopher tells me you've kept it up

08:17.585 --> 08:19.418
since she's been gone.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.047
I try to do the voices,
but she was better at it.

08:22.049 --> 08:23.604
Oh, I'm sure you're no slouch.

08:23.606 --> 08:24.895
Oh, no, he isn't.

08:26.588 --> 08:29.628
Christopher is also one of
our most popular students.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.763
He loves making the other kids laugh.

08:31.765 --> 08:33.332
- Is that a problem?
- Not at all.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.933
He's a very sweet and kind boy.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.369
You're doing a great job.

08:38.438 --> 08:39.770
Thank you.

08:43.744 --> 08:45.977
We gonna talk about that?

08:45.979 --> 08:49.948
That I'm basically raising a
funny, popular, young genius?

08:49.950 --> 08:52.650
That has a pretty young
thing for an English teacher.

08:52.652 --> 08:54.618
Was she pretty? Didn't even notice.

08:54.620 --> 08:55.786
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:55.788 --> 08:57.287
I must have you confused with someone

08:57.289 --> 09:00.290
who couldn't stop gazing into
Ms. Flores's big blue eyes.

09:00.292 --> 09:01.625
They were brown.

09:01.627 --> 09:02.860
And you're right.

09:02.862 --> 09:04.394
Too bad you didn't notice.

09:11.203 --> 09:12.970
Paging Dr. Becker.

09:12.972 --> 09:14.772
Paging Dr. Becker.

09:17.309 --> 09:18.742
Dr. Calloway.

09:18.744 --> 09:20.510
Sergeant Grant. Good to see you.

09:20.512 --> 09:23.413
- How's your husband?
- Bobby's doing well, thank you.

09:23.415 --> 09:24.815
You called in a gunshot wound?

09:24.817 --> 09:26.984
Yes. Female, early 50s.

09:26.986 --> 09:28.886
Came in complaining about headaches

09:28.888 --> 09:30.520
and some disorientation.

09:30.522 --> 09:33.856
Now, given the scar tissue,

09:33.858 --> 09:35.825
I'm going to estimate
this bullet has been there

09:35.827 --> 09:37.994
for two, maybe three months.

09:37.996 --> 09:41.164
Wait. This is an old gunshot wound?

09:41.166 --> 09:42.198
Yes.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.267
Why wasn't it reported
the day it happened?

09:44.269 --> 09:47.370
Because that woman didn't
even know she had been shot.

09:47.372 --> 09:48.805
Not until today.

09:57.699 --> 09:59.198
Joan?

09:59.200 --> 10:01.100
This is Detective Romero.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.268
He needs to ask you...

10:02.270 --> 10:04.070
More questions?

10:04.072 --> 10:07.425
I really think this has
to be a terrible mistake.

10:07.427 --> 10:09.641
I promise you I have never been shot.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.477
In the head or anywhere else.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.398
It feels like something I'd
remember, don't you think?

10:15.400 --> 10:17.248
Ma'am, we saw the X-rays.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.452
So did I. And Dr...

10:20.454 --> 10:24.189
- Calloway.
- Yes, Dr. Calloway.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.388
He seems like a lovely man,

10:26.390 --> 10:28.657
but hospitals always make mistakes.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.127
I've heard stories about people

10:31.129 --> 10:33.162
having the wrong limbs amputated.

10:33.164 --> 10:34.912
Well, the doctor seems pretty sure,

10:34.914 --> 10:36.404
so we need to investigate,

10:36.406 --> 10:38.167
find out what might've happened to you.

10:38.169 --> 10:40.369
So the doctor thinks
that if you were shot,

10:40.371 --> 10:42.371
it would've happened
sometime in January,

10:42.373 --> 10:43.522
maybe early February.

10:43.524 --> 10:45.673
Did anything during
that time period happen

10:45.675 --> 10:47.342
that was unusual?

10:47.344 --> 10:50.511
Not really. My life is pretty boring.

10:50.513 --> 10:53.381
It's just me and my husband.

10:53.383 --> 10:55.083
Where is your husband? Is he on his way?

10:55.085 --> 10:57.853
No, he's out of town. Golfing I think.

10:57.855 --> 11:00.553
Maybe Pebble Beach.

11:00.555 --> 11:02.378
He took early retirement last year,

11:02.380 --> 11:04.459
so he is always looking
for things to do.

11:04.461 --> 11:07.262
Me, I am a happy homebody.

11:07.264 --> 11:09.697
I should call him, shouldn't I?

11:09.699 --> 11:11.766
Oh, you know,

11:11.768 --> 11:14.769
I probably have the information in here.

11:18.075 --> 11:21.576
Joan, you came into
the ER with a headache.

11:21.578 --> 11:22.967
Do you get those a lot?

11:22.969 --> 11:25.747
Never used to, but now it
seems like I always have one.

11:25.749 --> 11:28.449
I tried cutting out caffeine

11:28.451 --> 11:31.586
and red wine and bacon, but still.

11:31.588 --> 11:33.654
Oh, here.

11:33.656 --> 11:34.756
Thank you.

11:36.393 --> 11:38.959
Do you normally write everything down?

11:38.961 --> 11:41.729
Always prided myself
in remembering things.

11:41.731 --> 11:44.932
Names, phone numbers, birthdays.

11:44.934 --> 11:46.200
But you get older,

11:46.202 --> 11:49.336
and you start to need a little help.

11:49.338 --> 11:52.172
- Joan, are you okay?
- Ooh.

11:52.174 --> 11:57.845
I think I need to talk to
that doctor again, um...

11:57.847 --> 12:00.047
- Dr...
- Calloway?

12:00.049 --> 12:03.116
Yes, thank you. Oh,
my memory is terrible.

12:03.118 --> 12:04.951
Do you mind if we keep
this? We'll return it.

12:04.953 --> 12:06.787
Oh, go right ahead.

12:06.789 --> 12:07.888
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Joan.

12:07.890 --> 12:08.988
Mm.

12:14.062 --> 12:15.796
She really doesn't remember being shot.

12:15.798 --> 12:17.196
I'm not sure she wants to.

12:17.198 --> 12:19.966
You think it's the husband.

12:19.968 --> 12:22.869
I think that no one ever really knows

12:22.871 --> 12:25.138
what goes on inside of a marriage.

12:25.140 --> 12:28.041
Sometimes, not even
the people inside it.

12:34.348 --> 12:35.348
Carla.

12:36.193 --> 12:37.381
What the hell happened?

12:37.383 --> 12:38.851
I told you Christopher is fine.

12:38.853 --> 12:40.018
You didn't have to come down here.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.119
It's just some scrapes and bruises.

12:41.121 --> 12:43.422
He hurt himself? How?

12:43.424 --> 12:45.825
Well, it turns out that
Christopher and skateboards

12:45.827 --> 12:47.015
don't get along very well.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.295
- You let him skateboard?
- I am so sorry, Mr. Diaz.

12:50.297 --> 12:52.297
We didn't know one of the
kids had brought a skateboard.

12:52.299 --> 12:53.766
You didn't know?

12:53.768 --> 12:54.834
He could've broken his neck.

12:54.836 --> 12:57.470
I know, and I feel terrible.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.872
The other kids were
showing him how to ride it

12:59.874 --> 13:01.593
- and they didn't know that...
- Didn't they?

13:01.595 --> 13:04.550
No, let's push the kid with CP
around on a skateboard for fun.

13:04.552 --> 13:06.174
You let them make a fool out of my son.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.433
Eddie.

13:07.435 --> 13:10.247
I promise you that's
not what happened here.

13:12.418 --> 13:14.285
Christopher. Hey.

13:15.822 --> 13:17.455
Oh, my God.

13:17.457 --> 13:19.056
Are you okay?

13:19.058 --> 13:21.626
I'm sorry about my clothes.

13:21.628 --> 13:22.760
No, don't worry about that.

13:22.762 --> 13:24.095
I could run to the house,

13:24.097 --> 13:25.697
get some clean clothes
for him to change into.

13:25.699 --> 13:27.298
No, we're done for the day.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.868
Come on. We're leaving.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.403
But school isn't over.

13:32.405 --> 13:34.405
It is now.

13:40.713 --> 13:42.046
Uh-huh.

13:45.684 --> 13:48.619
Well, I appreciate
that, Principal Summers.

13:48.621 --> 13:51.088
Okay. Thank you.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.724
So should I expect some
kid's head on a spike

13:53.726 --> 13:54.925
at tomorrow's drop-off?

13:54.927 --> 13:56.360
They sent skateboard kid home early.

13:56.362 --> 13:58.262
Principal's gonna meet with
the parents in the morning,

13:58.264 --> 13:59.530
figure out what the
punishment should be.

13:59.532 --> 14:02.433
And what about the kid who
fell off the skateboard?

14:02.435 --> 14:04.235
Think I should punish
Christopher for getting hurt?

14:04.237 --> 14:05.469
No,

14:05.471 --> 14:06.803
but I think you should talk to him

14:06.805 --> 14:08.805
about how he got hurt.

14:08.807 --> 14:12.009
I know Christopher wants to be
like all the other kids, but...

14:12.011 --> 14:13.109
You want me to tell him he's different?

14:13.111 --> 14:15.512
He already knows that.

14:15.514 --> 14:18.214
You need to teach him what it means.

14:19.785 --> 14:22.152
That he has limitations.

14:24.924 --> 14:26.990
I'm not gonna tell my kid that.

14:29.479 --> 14:32.396
Hey, buddy. How you feeling?

14:32.398 --> 14:33.496
Dumb.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.166
What? What are you talking about?

14:36.168 --> 14:39.069
Everybody saw me fall.

14:39.071 --> 14:42.238
People fall. It happens.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.473
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

14:44.475 --> 14:46.776
Mm-hmm, that boy should've
never pressured you

14:46.778 --> 14:48.210
into getting on that skateboard.

14:48.212 --> 14:49.278
It was my idea.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.450
It was your idea to
get on the skateboard?

14:54.452 --> 14:57.219
Looked fun. It wasn't.

14:57.221 --> 14:59.956
Chris, why would you do that?

14:59.958 --> 15:01.996
You had to know it'd be dangerous.

15:01.998 --> 15:04.860
You always said I can do anything.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.029
You lied.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.974
Okay, it worked. You inspired me.

15:19.976 --> 15:23.070
I don't think I meant
to, but you're welcome.

15:23.072 --> 15:25.739
I may have reactivated
one of my dating profiles.

15:25.741 --> 15:27.208
Really?

15:27.210 --> 15:29.710
I spent two hours on
the phone the other night

15:29.712 --> 15:34.181
talking to a cute guy
who seems sweet and funny

15:34.183 --> 15:36.572
and not at all like one
of those chat room psychos.

15:36.574 --> 15:37.985
Wait, how can you tell?

15:37.987 --> 15:40.921
His profile contains actual sentences

15:40.923 --> 15:43.256
with correct grammar and punctuation.

15:43.258 --> 15:45.509
There was even a successfully
deployed semicolon.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.345
Ugh, I never use semicolons.
I just don't get the point.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.181
Anyway, we're meeting up tonight

15:50.183 --> 15:52.416
in a public setting,

15:52.418 --> 15:54.518
and I am really looking forward to it.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.386
I just...

15:56.388 --> 15:57.922
What?

15:57.924 --> 16:00.724
I don't want the one-night stand.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.659
I'm tired of being alone.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.084
Aside from my coworkers,

16:04.086 --> 16:06.230
the most meaningful
relationships in my life

16:06.232 --> 16:08.265
are made 10 minutes at a time

16:08.267 --> 16:11.035
with people I'll never
see or talk to again,

16:11.037 --> 16:13.837
some of whom don't survive.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.373
It sounds silly, but he calls,

16:16.375 --> 16:18.041
and I'm excited to answer the phone

16:18.043 --> 16:20.377
for the first time in a long time.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.212
I don't think that sounds silly at all.

16:22.214 --> 16:25.515
So you don't think online
dating is a terrible idea?

16:25.517 --> 16:28.284
I think everyone has a match.

16:28.286 --> 16:30.387
You just have to find him.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.959
Hey, guys. Tessa here.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.928
I'm 27 and from the Bay Area.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.564
Full disclosure, I'm a vegan,

16:40.566 --> 16:43.633
so living that plant life,
but otherwise normal.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.102
I just reinstalled this app on my phone.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.303
Please don't make me regret it.

16:48.305 --> 16:51.507
Hello, women of the Internet.

16:51.509 --> 16:52.541
I'm Gary.

16:52.543 --> 16:55.878
I like long walks on the beach,

16:55.880 --> 16:57.546
deep conversations,

16:57.548 --> 17:01.550
and other boilerplate dating clichés.

17:01.552 --> 17:02.965
Hoping to find someone sweet

17:02.967 --> 17:04.920
to get me off this godforsaken app,

17:04.922 --> 17:07.155
so let me know.

17:10.461 --> 17:14.061
_

17:17.268 --> 17:20.835
_

17:24.073 --> 17:28.242
_

17:31.047 --> 17:32.847
Oh, yeah. Just right there.

17:37.721 --> 17:41.489
_

17:44.994 --> 17:48.484
_

17:48.486 --> 17:50.698
_

17:50.700 --> 17:53.868
_

18:15.325 --> 18:17.992
Come on, come on, come on.

18:17.994 --> 18:19.760
No, no, no. Oh, no.

18:21.831 --> 18:25.299
Oh, shoot!

18:32.342 --> 18:34.407
Okay, come on.

18:37.145 --> 18:38.845
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:51.093 --> 18:53.293
Come on, come on. Come on.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.163
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:57.165 --> 18:58.764
Okay.

19:04.139 --> 19:06.206
Come on.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.707
Come on!

19:08.976 --> 19:10.209
Oh, God. Okay.

19:10.211 --> 19:13.045
Okay.

19:18.119 --> 19:19.784
Come on.

19:24.203 --> 19:27.926
_

19:34.080 --> 19:35.800
Bathroom door's locked.

19:35.802 --> 19:38.037
Eddie, can you move her or not?

19:38.039 --> 19:39.338
Not there yet, Cap.

19:42.742 --> 19:44.909
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your...

19:44.911 --> 19:47.912
Watch out!

19:49.249 --> 19:50.415
- Oh!
- Oh.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.750
And I thought the new
baby went everywhere.

19:52.752 --> 19:55.708
This is not the fairytale
romance I had in mind.

19:55.710 --> 19:58.956
So what, bad date and
you were trying to escape?

19:58.958 --> 20:01.159
No, there was a whole
Lemony Snicket level

20:01.161 --> 20:02.593
of things that went wrong here.

20:02.595 --> 20:05.196
- She clear of the door?
- Sure is, Cap.

20:05.198 --> 20:06.431
Do what you gotta do.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.169
Oh, God.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.737
He's never gonna wanna see me again.

20:13.739 --> 20:16.097
I'm sorry. I'll pay to fix that.

20:16.099 --> 20:18.283
Okay, guys, let's try to
gently pull her through.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.678
Ma'am, I need you to exhale.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.779
Okay.

20:21.781 --> 20:22.880
Okay, stop.

20:22.882 --> 20:24.548
She's not gonna come
out the way she went in.

20:24.550 --> 20:26.383
Cap, this is original wood.

20:26.385 --> 20:28.886
We can't just poop out the top panel.

20:28.888 --> 20:31.722
Pop. We, uh, can't just
pop out the top panel.

20:31.724 --> 20:32.823
Sorry.

20:32.825 --> 20:33.924
We have to take apart the frame.

20:33.926 --> 20:35.363
Guys, we're gonna need the saws.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.794
You're gonna cut the window?

20:36.796 --> 20:38.261
This just keeps getting worse.

20:38.263 --> 20:40.352
Ma'am, just try to stay calm.
How's she looking, Hen?

20:40.354 --> 20:43.300
Vitals are good. Just
breathing a little heavy.

20:43.302 --> 20:44.802
Are you in pain?

20:44.804 --> 20:45.836
No,

20:45.838 --> 20:48.205
but has anyone ever
died of actual shame?

20:48.207 --> 20:49.639
I'm sorry, Gary.

20:49.641 --> 20:51.674
This is not how I wanted
our first date to go.

20:51.676 --> 20:54.344
It can only get better from here, right?

20:54.346 --> 20:55.945
I've always wanted a bay window.

20:55.947 --> 20:57.847
He's probably never gonna
wanna speak to me again,

20:57.849 --> 20:59.516
and you have no idea how hard it is

20:59.518 --> 21:01.485
- to meet someone these days.
- Oh, believe me,

21:01.487 --> 21:03.386
as a fellow solo, I know.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.023
Eddie might've finally
met someone special.

21:05.025 --> 21:06.223
Then he went and bit her head off.

21:06.225 --> 21:07.564
Now she'll never talk to him again

21:07.566 --> 21:09.292
and will probably flunk his kid.

21:11.163 --> 21:12.629
Well, you kinda did.

21:12.631 --> 21:14.264
Saw's on its way up, Cap.

21:14.266 --> 21:15.932
Are you guys using a saw?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.506
All right, guys. We got her out.

21:23.508 --> 21:25.508
Can you take a deep breath for me?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.877
Any pain in your ribs?

21:28.879 --> 21:29.945
I'm okay.

21:29.947 --> 21:31.413
You good? All right.

21:38.822 --> 21:40.922
I'll call a Lyft.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.424
Oh.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.092
Or you... or you could stay.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.697
_

21:50.334 --> 21:54.303
_

22:02.423 --> 22:04.924
Pretty sure all kids
call their parents liars

22:04.926 --> 22:06.324
at some point.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.620
Yeah, well, feels a little different

22:08.622 --> 22:09.887
when you hear it coming out of your kid.

22:09.889 --> 22:11.423
Just wait till he gets to the

22:11.425 --> 22:13.267
"I don't have to do
what you tell me" phase.

22:13.269 --> 22:15.135
Aren't you still in that phase?

22:15.137 --> 22:16.803
The thing is, he's right.

22:16.805 --> 22:18.338
I lied to him.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.274
Or maybe I lied to myself.

22:20.276 --> 22:22.409
Either way, I feel like a fool.

22:22.411 --> 22:24.811
I spent years trying to convince my kid

22:24.813 --> 22:26.780
to believe in the Easter Bunny.

22:28.550 --> 22:30.717
But now I gotta tell
him none of it's real.

22:30.719 --> 22:33.165
Yeah, I think you might
be overcorrecting here.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.389
Told him he's no different
than the other kid.

22:35.391 --> 22:37.024
But he is. He has CP.

22:38.394 --> 22:39.592
There's a lot he can't do.

22:41.029 --> 22:43.296
Have you ever heard of Jim Abbott?

22:43.298 --> 22:44.697
- Baseball player?
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.699 --> 22:46.299
Pitched a no-hitter in the '90s,

22:46.301 --> 22:48.635
which in itself is pretty crazy,

22:48.637 --> 22:51.003
but it's even crazier

22:51.005 --> 22:54.941
if you know that Jim Abbott
was only born with one hand.

22:54.943 --> 22:56.175
Yeah, really.

22:56.177 --> 22:57.944
I read his book when
I was in the hospital.

22:57.946 --> 22:59.546
Okay.

22:59.548 --> 23:00.947
How'd he do it?

23:00.949 --> 23:03.483
He practiced switching his glove

23:03.485 --> 23:05.919
to his throwing hand relentlessly

23:05.921 --> 23:08.087
so that he could field after he pitched.

23:08.089 --> 23:10.924
I like the positivity.

23:10.926 --> 23:12.759
I'm just not sure how
any amount of practice

23:12.761 --> 23:14.694
is gonna help Chris
stay on a skateboard.

23:24.438 --> 23:26.304
I'm not an invalid, you know.

23:26.306 --> 23:28.740
I can still get groceries for myself.

23:28.742 --> 23:31.109
I'm doing something nice.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.143
Say thank you.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.345
Ooh. Thank you.

23:33.347 --> 23:35.046
Huh. You're welcome.

23:35.048 --> 23:37.950
So what's happening now
with your bullet lady?

23:37.952 --> 23:39.518
They removed the bullet this morning,

23:39.520 --> 23:41.487
so just waiting on ballistics

23:41.489 --> 23:43.856
to give us a clue to something.

23:43.858 --> 23:45.223
Well, what about the husband?

23:47.561 --> 23:50.562
Claims he has no
idea how his wife got shot.

23:50.564 --> 23:52.063
I love you.

23:52.065 --> 23:53.230
I love you too.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.465
I love you more.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.734
He actually tried to interrogate us.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.921
Yeah, the best defense
is a good offense.

23:58.923 --> 24:00.237
What about his alibi?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.573
Well, we don't even
know when she was shot.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.809
I mean, without a specific timeline,

24:04.811 --> 24:06.259
we can't prove anything.

24:06.261 --> 24:09.480
And the wife still doesn't
suspect him at all?

24:09.482 --> 24:11.983
They say love is blind.

24:11.985 --> 24:14.616
But in this case, I think willfully so.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.923
I mean, she went from
having a great memory

24:18.925 --> 24:20.491
to forgetting the name of the doctor

24:20.493 --> 24:22.259
that she met an hour ago.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.194
Never prone to headaches,

24:24.196 --> 24:26.730
but now she chewing aspirin
like they breath mints.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.900
I mean, her whole life fell apart.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.069
But she chose not to
seek help for months.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.970
Well, maybe she just can't believe

24:33.972 --> 24:37.007
the man that she married
could ever hurt her.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.339
Hell, he's her husband.
She thinks she knows him.

24:39.341 --> 24:41.878
Yeah, sometimes you don't
know who you married to,

24:41.880 --> 24:43.780
and sometimes, they
don't want you to know.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.184
The truth eventually comes out, though.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.719
But maybe with this,

24:49.721 --> 24:51.522
it'll come out with your bullet.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.057
Hmm.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.259
Yeah.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.761
You know, the surgeon said

24:57.763 --> 24:59.896
that taking it out wasn't that hard.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.598
I mean, they were worried about
the location of the bullet,

25:02.600 --> 25:05.601
the risk of taking it
out, but as it turns out,

25:05.603 --> 25:07.503
she's just fine.

25:11.008 --> 25:12.608
Oh, Athena.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.343
Well, you know, now I finally know

25:14.345 --> 25:16.312
the motive of the groceries.

25:16.314 --> 25:20.983
Look, I am not having
this conversation again.

25:20.985 --> 25:23.519
I am not doing that surgery.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.853
So you're just gonna wait to die.

25:24.855 --> 25:28.057
I'm going through
another bout of radiation.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.793
The doctors put my name
on a list for a trial

25:30.795 --> 25:33.129
for this new chemotherapy pill.

25:33.131 --> 25:34.797
You know, it's showing some promise

25:34.799 --> 25:36.563
for shrinking tumors.

25:36.565 --> 25:39.401
- How much promise?
- Look, I know that you think...

25:39.403 --> 25:42.170
That you are a fool.

25:42.172 --> 25:44.439
Look, I wanna be supportive, Michael,

25:44.441 --> 25:46.775
I wanna respect your wishes, but...

25:50.514 --> 25:53.716
I do not want you to die.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.551
Me either. Okay?

26:05.395 --> 26:08.897
Oh, ballistics just came
back. They found a match.

26:08.899 --> 26:10.398
Does the gun belong to the husband?

26:10.400 --> 26:11.966
Worse.

26:11.968 --> 26:14.469
It belongs to the wife.

26:15.839 --> 26:17.405
Seem to be quite a few books.

26:17.407 --> 26:19.774
This was Victor's.

26:19.776 --> 26:22.710
His parents' medical library.

26:22.712 --> 26:25.380
And where is my
grandfather's private library?

26:25.382 --> 26:26.881
I don't know what you mean, sir.

26:26.883 --> 26:28.401
Well...

26:28.403 --> 26:31.461
Captain Frankenstein.

26:37.027 --> 26:38.960
Stay close to the candles.

26:38.962 --> 26:40.795
- Greg?
- You must be Josh.

26:40.797 --> 26:42.297
It's really nice to meet you.

26:42.299 --> 26:45.378
As first dates go, I gotta
admit you chose well.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.668
You know, you don't usually
think of the cemetery

26:47.670 --> 26:49.436
as a romantic place for a date,

26:49.438 --> 26:52.506
but it's quaint, kind of kitschy,

26:52.508 --> 26:53.707
and there are plenty of exits

26:53.709 --> 26:56.177
in case one of us turns
out to be too sketchy.

26:56.179 --> 26:59.736
I figure there is nothing more romantic

26:59.738 --> 27:03.651
than watching an old movie

27:03.653 --> 27:05.186
snacking on the graves

27:05.188 --> 27:07.221
of the people who used to make them.

27:07.223 --> 27:08.389
Thank you.

27:08.391 --> 27:11.124
If the zombies rise up, we'd be eaten

27:11.126 --> 27:13.627
by all the silver screen
starlets and screenwriters.

27:13.629 --> 27:15.629
I love it.

27:15.631 --> 27:16.730
Cheers.

27:16.732 --> 27:17.763
Cheers.

27:22.003 --> 27:24.704
Do you understand?

27:24.706 --> 27:26.206
I understand, I understand.

27:29.311 --> 27:33.012
And you like it there?
It's not too stressful?

27:33.014 --> 27:37.350
No, it's unbelievably stressful.

27:37.352 --> 27:40.253
But how many jobs can you
go home at the end of the day

27:40.255 --> 27:42.347
and feel like you've made a difference?

27:42.349 --> 27:45.139
I'll never be rich. I'll
never even be recognized.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.126
But I'll be...

27:47.128 --> 27:48.128
worthwhile.

27:50.064 --> 27:52.731
You know, I remember
when going to the movies

27:52.733 --> 27:54.733
was about making out in the back row.

27:56.069 --> 27:59.338
I heard Rudolph Valentino's
grave is somewhere around here.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.206
Maybe in the back row.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.585
This is exactly what I said
I wouldn't do on a first date.

28:13.587 --> 28:15.554
Oh, come on. This is the fun stuff.

28:15.556 --> 28:16.855
Took you long enough.

28:18.225 --> 28:19.391
Uh...

28:19.393 --> 28:21.245
okay, I don't know
what you guys are into,

28:21.247 --> 28:23.228
but it definitely doesn't
feel like my scene.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.166
You know, for somebody
who spends their days

28:25.168 --> 28:27.231
listening for clues,

28:27.233 --> 28:29.233
you sure managed to miss all of 'em.

28:32.639 --> 28:34.390
No. Please.

28:34.392 --> 28:36.222
Hey, I'm not the one who went online

28:36.224 --> 28:38.108
begging somebody to play me.

28:45.851 --> 28:48.786
Let's go.

28:48.788 --> 28:51.255
Hey, what's going on over there?

28:52.052 --> 28:54.052
_

29:07.828 --> 29:09.061
Oh, my God.

29:10.361 --> 29:11.517
Josh, are you okay?

29:11.519 --> 29:12.708
I'm okay.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.466
- What happened?
- I got jumped.

29:14.468 --> 29:16.769
They took my keys, my phone, my wallet,

29:16.771 --> 29:18.834
beat the crap out of me.

29:18.836 --> 29:20.068
For a minute there, I...

29:21.315 --> 29:23.315
I thought they were gonna kill me.

29:23.317 --> 29:25.317
Was this after your
date? The movie thing?

29:25.319 --> 29:27.485
It was my date.

29:27.487 --> 29:30.127
- He was the one.
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

29:30.129 --> 29:31.218
He set me up.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.860
Him and his friend. I
never even saw it coming.

29:34.862 --> 29:36.294
I am an idiot.

29:37.497 --> 29:39.331
I thought he was sweet.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.333
- That he liked me.
- No.

29:41.335 --> 29:43.401
You just trusted the wrong person.

29:43.403 --> 29:45.169
Mr. Russo?

29:46.940 --> 29:49.173
We had officers canvass the cemetery.

29:49.175 --> 29:50.612
There's still no sign of your phone,

29:50.614 --> 29:52.944
but they recovered your
keys and your wallet.

29:52.946 --> 29:54.779
I'm afraid the cash was gone though.

29:54.781 --> 29:56.047
At least they saved me the hassle

29:56.049 --> 29:58.717
of replacing all my
credit cards and IDs.

29:58.719 --> 30:00.652
You can pick up
your things at the station.

30:00.654 --> 30:02.804
A detective will take
your formal statement then.

30:02.806 --> 30:04.656
Does that have to happen tonight?

30:04.658 --> 30:05.824
I'm just really worn out.

30:05.826 --> 30:08.292
Well, you know what? You can
just stay with me tonight

30:08.294 --> 30:09.969
and I'll drive you to the
station in the morning.

30:09.971 --> 30:12.364
Of course. Tomorrow is fine.

30:12.366 --> 30:14.565
Are you sure you didn't
recognize either man?

30:14.567 --> 30:15.995
No identifiable features?

30:15.997 --> 30:18.369
No. Sorry.

30:18.371 --> 30:19.570
Look, we'll do our best,

30:19.572 --> 30:21.705
but I need to set your expectations.

30:21.707 --> 30:23.540
No, I know the drill.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.376
If it's okay, I'd
like to get out of here

30:25.378 --> 30:28.144
and just put this whole night behind me.

30:29.281 --> 30:30.714
Call us if you think of anything else.

30:30.716 --> 30:32.215
Thanks.

30:34.453 --> 30:37.621
- Josh.
- I already feel like a fool.

30:37.623 --> 30:39.990
I don't need the rest of
the world in on the joke.

30:41.427 --> 30:42.427
Okay.

30:52.404 --> 30:54.670
- Nothing?
- No sign of the gun.

30:54.672 --> 30:56.238
Or any gun.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.074
No ammunition, no
gunshot residue, no blood.

30:59.076 --> 31:00.242
The house is immaculate.

31:00.244 --> 31:01.577
Ha!

31:05.116 --> 31:07.717
Ma'am? Hi, LAPD.

31:07.719 --> 31:09.151
May we speak to you a moment?

31:09.153 --> 31:11.353
I don't see why not. Just
doing a little yard work.

31:11.355 --> 31:13.789
Yes, Detective Romero was remarking

31:13.791 --> 31:16.024
on how lovely your yard looks.

31:16.026 --> 31:18.198
Being out here does
take up most of my day.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.191
Oh, I'm sure you see everything
that goes on around here.

31:21.193 --> 31:24.384
I am also the president
of our neighborhood watch.

31:24.386 --> 31:26.809
I take that responsibility
very seriously.

31:26.811 --> 31:28.011
Mm.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.604
How well do you know the Wallaces?

31:29.606 --> 31:33.007
We wave occasionally.
I always liked Joan.

31:33.009 --> 31:34.609
Never that sure about Henry.

31:34.611 --> 31:38.279
Then he retired, and I finally
was able to make up my mind.

31:38.281 --> 31:40.248
I don't like the man.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.984
Between you and me, I'm
not sure Joan does either.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.486
They weren't getting along?

31:44.488 --> 31:47.855
You know, people used to retire at 65

31:47.857 --> 31:50.758
back when life expectancy was 68.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.227
Now, it's all early retirement

31:53.229 --> 31:55.129
and late life divorce.

31:56.132 --> 31:58.399
I'm sorry, but I don't understand

31:58.401 --> 32:01.369
what any of this has
to do with the break-in.

32:01.371 --> 32:03.537
Someone broke into their home?

32:03.539 --> 32:05.773
I assumed that was
why you all were here.

32:05.775 --> 32:09.143
Though honestly, you are
a little late to the party.

32:09.145 --> 32:12.513
That must've been three months ago.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.983
Did the Wallaces tell
you they'd had a break-in?

32:14.985 --> 32:17.485
No. Their contractor did.

32:19.155 --> 32:20.921
That window there was replaced.

32:20.923 --> 32:24.324
The contractor hauled away
some furniture and a rug,

32:24.326 --> 32:26.227
a bunch of Christmas decorations.

32:26.229 --> 32:28.996
Said he painted and
redid the floors too.

32:28.998 --> 32:30.663
Redecorating the crime scene?

32:30.665 --> 32:32.899
That's why we couldn't find anything.

32:32.901 --> 32:34.901
Didn't see Joan or Henry for weeks.

32:34.903 --> 32:36.336
They were out of town.

32:36.338 --> 32:38.338
Do you remember when
all of this happened?

32:39.816 --> 32:41.306
January 11th.

32:41.308 --> 32:43.131
Would you like the
contractor's information?

32:43.133 --> 32:45.823
Yes. Then I'd like to hug you.

32:48.351 --> 32:51.018
I think it'd be best if
Mr. Wallace stepped outside.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.686
That's silly. Henry should stay.

32:53.688 --> 32:56.155
My memory is terrible.
Maybe he can help.

32:57.258 --> 32:59.458
You can have this back. We made a copy.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.692
Thanks.

33:00.694 --> 33:03.129
I was wondering where that had got to.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.698
When we were looking through it,

33:04.700 --> 33:06.956
we noticed that there
didn't seem to be any entries

33:06.958 --> 33:10.002
about your trip, or
the living room remodel.

33:11.506 --> 33:13.539
Did we remodel the living room?

33:14.909 --> 33:18.210
No, that's right. We did.

33:20.048 --> 33:24.150
I just don't remember why, though.

33:24.152 --> 33:26.318
We just finished the house last year.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.622
Why did we redo the living room?

33:30.624 --> 33:33.225
Do you remember what
happened on January 11th?

33:34.395 --> 33:37.364
Maybe you were taking
down Christmas decorations?

33:37.366 --> 33:40.577
No, we always take those
down right after New Year's.

33:49.076 --> 33:51.643
Henry, what happened to that rug?

33:51.645 --> 33:55.280
Oh, I loved that rug.

33:55.282 --> 33:57.115
Why did we replace it?

33:58.285 --> 33:59.918
There was an accident.

34:07.661 --> 34:09.359
Henry...

34:12.297 --> 34:13.998
What did you do?

34:19.072 --> 34:20.771
What did you do?

34:27.112 --> 34:29.614
I thought you were gonna take
down those wreaths for me.

34:29.616 --> 34:31.782
- In a minute.
- No more minutes.

34:31.784 --> 34:33.985
We should've put all
this stuff away last week.

34:33.987 --> 34:36.152
What happens if we don't?

34:36.155 --> 34:37.931
Does the world come screeching to a halt

34:37.933 --> 34:41.025
because the wreaths are up past MLK Day?

34:41.027 --> 34:42.826
I don't know why you're like this.

34:42.828 --> 34:45.629
I miss when you used
to work for a living.

34:45.630 --> 34:48.532
Yeah, well, you've never
worked a day in your life.

34:48.534 --> 34:49.899
Oh, the hell I haven't.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.541
I have taken care of this house

34:51.543 --> 34:54.170
and I've taken care of
you for the last 30 years,

34:54.172 --> 34:55.772
and all I ask is that you...

34:55.774 --> 34:56.867
And all you have asked

34:56.869 --> 34:59.042
is that I work 60-plus hours a week

34:59.044 --> 35:01.311
to support you and this house

35:01.313 --> 35:04.281
and whatever ridiculously
expensive hobby

35:04.283 --> 35:05.315
your heart desires.

35:05.317 --> 35:07.618
Ceramics class?

35:07.620 --> 35:10.154
Henry, what did you do?

35:10.156 --> 35:11.821
Do you know how hard I worked on that?

35:11.823 --> 35:13.322
No, but I know how much it cost me

35:13.324 --> 35:14.990
for you to learn how to make something

35:14.992 --> 35:17.126
that I could buy for 20 bucks!

35:17.128 --> 35:18.461
Glass-blowing lessons!

35:20.998 --> 35:22.365
What are you doing?

35:22.367 --> 35:24.066
This is my time!

35:24.068 --> 35:25.601
My retirement!

35:25.603 --> 35:28.571
And I'm not gonna let you
rule my golden damn years

35:28.573 --> 35:30.473
the way you rule the
rest of my damn life.

35:39.284 --> 35:40.416
Fine.

35:44.454 --> 35:47.522
I will deal with the decorations myself.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.227
I always thought when you retired,

35:52.229 --> 35:54.829
it would be our time.

35:54.831 --> 35:57.165
Our time together.

35:59.203 --> 36:01.069
I know you're upset about something,

36:01.071 --> 36:02.904
but I'm your wife,

36:02.906 --> 36:04.372
so you're stuck with me.

36:22.191 --> 36:23.490
You shot me.

36:26.161 --> 36:28.397
I don't know what came over me.

36:28.399 --> 36:31.332
The thought of 30 more years
in that house with you, and I...

36:34.604 --> 36:36.937
Call it temporary insanity.

36:36.939 --> 36:38.606
Well, you are certainly
within your rights

36:38.608 --> 36:40.307
to make that case to a judge.

36:40.309 --> 36:41.808
I'm sorry, Joanie.

36:41.810 --> 36:44.745
I regretted it immediately
after I did it.

36:44.747 --> 36:47.306
I tried to make it up
to you as best I could.

36:47.308 --> 36:48.330
After.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.183
You lied to me.

36:50.185 --> 36:53.119
All this time, you knew
what was wrong with me,

36:53.121 --> 36:56.456
and you kept telling me
it was all in my head.

36:56.458 --> 36:58.658
Well, I guess it was,

36:58.660 --> 37:00.360
because you put it there.

37:05.316 --> 37:07.150
Now, you're gonna be okay.

37:08.270 --> 37:10.570
He played me for a fool.

37:10.572 --> 37:14.307
And you just showed
him that he was wrong.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.181
Chris. Come on, buddy.

37:23.183 --> 37:25.350
Eat something before school.

37:25.352 --> 37:27.352
I don't feel well.

37:28.589 --> 37:31.023
You sick?

37:31.025 --> 37:32.190
Hmm.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.684
You sure?

37:35.686 --> 37:36.762
I don't wanna go.

37:36.764 --> 37:39.131
Okay.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.672
You still upset about the other day?

37:47.674 --> 37:51.209
I just wanna be like everyone else.

37:51.211 --> 37:52.310
I know.

37:54.181 --> 37:56.214
But you're not.

37:56.216 --> 37:58.416
I know I told you you can do anything,

37:58.418 --> 38:01.419
and that was a dumb thing for me to say.

38:01.421 --> 38:03.021
Because I have CP.

38:03.023 --> 38:04.356
No.

38:04.358 --> 38:05.557
Because...

38:07.227 --> 38:09.427
Nobody can do everything.

38:10.564 --> 38:12.897
And yes,

38:12.899 --> 38:14.104
there are things in life

38:14.106 --> 38:15.973
that you're not gonna be able to do.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.937
And there's other stuff that
you are gonna be able to do,

38:19.939 --> 38:23.141
but it's gonna be a lot harder
than it is for the other kids

38:23.143 --> 38:24.575
because you have CP.

38:24.577 --> 38:28.245
I'm sorry. I won't skateboard again.

38:28.247 --> 38:30.414
It's not about the skateboarding.

38:31.584 --> 38:33.685
I just don't want you to be scared.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.955
You tried something,
and it didn't work out.

38:37.957 --> 38:39.523
Maybe the next time it does.

38:39.525 --> 38:42.060
But you can skateboard.

38:42.062 --> 38:43.294
You know what I can't do?

38:43.296 --> 38:46.164
Cook?

38:46.166 --> 38:48.465
Hey, that's not nice.

38:48.467 --> 38:51.435
But probably true.

38:51.437 --> 38:53.104
I have black thumb.

38:53.106 --> 38:55.807
I've killed every plant
that's ever been given to me.

38:55.809 --> 38:57.974
But your science teacher told me

38:57.976 --> 39:00.377
that you did the best job

39:00.379 --> 39:01.679
out of your whole class

39:01.681 --> 39:04.481
growing plants from seeds,

39:04.483 --> 39:06.116
so there's something
you're better at than me.

39:06.118 --> 39:07.618
- Really?
- Really.

39:09.255 --> 39:12.289
I don't want you to ever stop trying.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.458
But maybe...

39:14.460 --> 39:15.759
until you get a little older,

39:15.761 --> 39:18.262
maybe we try new things together, okay?

39:18.264 --> 39:19.830
Okay.

39:21.634 --> 39:23.367
You're not like any other kid.

39:23.369 --> 39:25.769
You're my kid.

39:25.771 --> 39:28.305
I love you more than
anything in this world.

39:28.307 --> 39:29.973
I love you too, Dad.

39:29.975 --> 39:31.841
Aw. Mwah.

39:37.582 --> 39:38.948
Sorry, is this a bad time?

39:38.950 --> 39:40.116
Mr. Diaz.

39:40.118 --> 39:41.718
Eddie.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.453
Please.

39:43.455 --> 39:45.855
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

39:45.857 --> 39:48.625
I was out of line and
you didn't deserve that.

39:48.627 --> 39:50.560
You had every right to be upset.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.228
It's my job to look after your son

39:52.230 --> 39:54.297
and I failed to do that.

39:54.299 --> 39:56.499
I'm just relieved Christopher is okay.

39:56.501 --> 39:58.324
Yeah, I fight so hard
to try and protect him,

39:58.326 --> 40:00.136
I forget falling down is a part of life.

40:00.138 --> 40:02.037
It's supposed to teach us
how to get back up, right?

40:02.039 --> 40:03.161
Yes.

40:03.163 --> 40:05.340
There's a lot to be said for
getting back on the horse,

40:05.342 --> 40:06.877
but there's also some value

40:06.879 --> 40:08.744
in learning that you don't like horses.

40:08.746 --> 40:10.579
I'm sorry?

40:10.581 --> 40:14.616
Sometimes, our limitations
tell us when to stop.

40:14.618 --> 40:17.919
But sometimes, they can
show us where to look next.

40:17.921 --> 40:20.422
Today, he falls off the skateboard.

40:20.424 --> 40:22.824
But tomorrow, he writes
the great American novel.

40:24.127 --> 40:26.227
I know you said he was
doing good in class, but...

40:27.431 --> 40:30.031
Okay, maybe not tomorrow, but...

40:30.033 --> 40:31.266
Someday.

40:31.268 --> 40:32.934
Yeah.

40:32.936 --> 40:34.102
Someday.

40:38.574 --> 40:41.876
Welcome back!

40:41.878 --> 40:43.011
Thank you.

40:43.013 --> 40:44.666
If I'd known I'd get
this much attention,

40:44.668 --> 40:45.948
I would've gotten mugged sooner.

40:47.217 --> 40:48.516
Hi.

40:48.518 --> 40:50.084
- Ah, there he is.
- Good to see you, thanks.

40:50.086 --> 40:51.719
- Hey, welcome back, Josh.
- Good to see you.

40:51.721 --> 40:53.922
- Thanks.
- Josh, you're back!

40:53.924 --> 40:55.589
Okay.

40:56.726 --> 40:59.060
You didn't tell them. Thanks.

40:59.062 --> 41:01.395
You asked me not. I'm
still not sure why.

41:01.397 --> 41:03.698
- This was not your fault.
- I should've known better.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.666
It's not too late to
go back to the police.

41:05.668 --> 41:07.637
You know, I tried to
pull up his profile,

41:07.639 --> 41:09.729
get a copy of his photo, but it's gone.

41:09.731 --> 41:12.640
Completely scrubbed.
It was a total scam.

41:12.642 --> 41:15.042
Yeah, that probably
means he's done it before.

41:15.044 --> 41:16.794
If you could get them
a description of him,

41:16.796 --> 41:18.713
maybe they could find him.

41:18.715 --> 41:20.914
- I mean, he hurt you.
- Bruises are healing.

41:20.916 --> 41:24.017
The humiliation, that's a
little harder to get over.

41:24.019 --> 41:25.553
And to have it written
down in some report

41:25.555 --> 41:27.321
for strangers to see?

41:27.323 --> 41:29.089
I can't, Maddie.

41:29.091 --> 41:31.091
So what, you're just gonna
act like it didn't happen?

41:31.093 --> 41:32.125
No, I'm not.

41:32.127 --> 41:34.094
I'll deal with it.

41:34.096 --> 41:35.463
In my own way.

41:47.642 --> 41:49.709
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

41:51.513 --> 41:53.112
And can I get your location?

41:55.283 --> 41:57.684
Okay.

42:00.489 --> 42:02.121
- Nice.
- Yeah.

42:24.979 --> 42:26.946
Thought you could use some carbs.

42:36.925 --> 42:39.125
Dad,

42:39.127 --> 42:40.492
I don't wanna be here.

42:40.494 --> 42:41.560
Trust me, it'll be fun.

42:41.562 --> 42:43.329
Hey, Chris!

42:43.331 --> 42:45.965
Surprise!

42:45.967 --> 42:48.100
- What's that?
- Hey, remember when I told you

42:48.102 --> 42:50.402
that if you wanted to try something new,

42:50.404 --> 42:51.970
we should try it together?

42:51.972 --> 42:53.338
Yeah.

42:53.340 --> 42:54.673
Let's try skateboarding.

42:54.675 --> 42:56.341
- Okay.
- Okay!

42:57.978 --> 42:59.177
Ready to ride?

42:59.179 --> 43:00.278
Ready!

43:00.280 --> 43:02.614
Away we go.
