WEBVTT

00:03.540 --> 00:04.668
Hey, Calvin.

00:04.693 --> 00:05.895
I can't hear you.

00:06.262 --> 00:07.993
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

00:08.018 --> 00:10.776
I still can't hear you, but no.

00:11.603 --> 00:12.769
Please?

00:15.880 --> 00:17.442
Yeah, man. What's up?

00:17.467 --> 00:19.331
So, our anniversary is coming up.

00:19.356 --> 00:20.828
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave,

00:20.853 --> 00:22.767
we've only known each
other for two months.

00:23.812 --> 00:26.453
Well, I was talking about me and Gemma.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.890
Besides, our man-iversary
isn't until the fifth.

00:29.782 --> 00:32.164
So, how are you two celebrating?

00:32.189 --> 00:34.807
You know, Gemma's under a lot
of pressure with the new job

00:34.832 --> 00:36.531
and still getting used to living here,

00:36.556 --> 00:39.571
so I want to do something
really special for her.

00:39.730 --> 00:42.762
Like the time you tried to
take me to a Renaissance fair?

00:43.335 --> 00:45.297
You would've had fun, Milord.

00:46.953 --> 00:48.211
Anyway, look,

00:48.236 --> 00:50.895
I'm having a box of her favorite
cupcakes flown in from Michigan.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.678
I got a fancy bottle of champagne.

00:52.704 --> 00:56.874
I even may have choreographed a
little dance number for her.

00:57.092 --> 00:58.843
You know, like Magic Mike.

00:58.916 --> 01:01.815
I'm guessing more like Tragic Dave.

01:03.178 --> 01:06.704
I-I just really want to help
her put everything aside

01:06.729 --> 01:08.062
for one night,

01:08.425 --> 01:10.264
just try to get Gemma to relax.

01:10.289 --> 01:12.564
Oh. Yeah, I get it.

01:12.775 --> 01:14.330
You're not getting sex.

01:15.062 --> 01:16.655
Well, y...

01:16.680 --> 01:18.813
You know how things can slow down

01:18.838 --> 01:21.616
when you get busy and with the kids.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.397
No, Dave, I don't.

01:24.383 --> 01:26.862
You're gonna tell me you and
Tina never had a dry spell?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.049
Dave. Dave.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.174
In-in the Butler household,

01:33.199 --> 01:37.252
it's like monsoon season
all-year-round, bud.

01:37.818 --> 01:39.618
So, what's your secret?

01:39.643 --> 01:41.109
Well, damn, Dave.

01:41.148 --> 01:42.442
Check it out.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.457
You know?

01:47.695 --> 01:50.992
I maintain my sexy, you know?

01:52.002 --> 01:55.358
Well, you know, I keep it sexy, too.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.211
A lot of people say I look
just like Tom Cruise.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.409
Yeah.

02:04.735 --> 02:07.157
Yeah, a'ight. Yeah.

02:07.978 --> 02:10.614
Anyway, look, I-I planned
the perfect night.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.172
There's just one problem.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.563
We need to find someone
to watch Grover.

02:14.588 --> 02:16.358
Well, why don't you get a babysitter?

02:16.383 --> 02:19.465
Well, we would, but since we
moved, we haven't found anyone.

02:19.490 --> 02:21.474
You know, back in Michigan,
we knew all our neighbors

02:21.499 --> 02:24.473
and felt comfortable leaving
him with them. But...

02:25.034 --> 02:27.060
the only neighbors we know here

02:27.085 --> 02:28.575
are you guys.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.677
Oh. Okay, say no more.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.259
I got the answer to your problem.

02:32.284 --> 02:35.825
Oh, Calvin, thank you so, so much.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.734
Move back to Michigan.

02:37.759 --> 02:39.145
Let's go, baby.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.051
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:53.580 --> 02:56.077
- Oh. Hey, Tina.
- Hey, Gemma. You busy?

02:56.102 --> 02:57.568
Ugh, actually, I'm swamped.

02:57.593 --> 02:59.732
- I brought wine.
- I could use a break.

03:01.456 --> 03:04.720
Wow. Look at all this paperwork.

03:04.745 --> 03:07.534
No wonder you're looking
like the Apocalypse Barbie.

03:08.669 --> 03:10.673
I just have so much to do.

03:10.698 --> 03:11.561
I have to finish

03:11.586 --> 03:12.842
teacher evaluations,

03:12.867 --> 03:14.157
go through grant proposals,

03:14.182 --> 03:16.527
and get ready for a visit
from the superintendent.

03:16.552 --> 03:18.851
Damn, that's stressful. I always
thought principal was like

03:18.876 --> 03:20.426
a figurehead position, you know?

03:20.451 --> 03:21.244
Like the queen.

03:23.415 --> 03:26.757
I don't think the queen wears the
same bra five days in a row.

03:28.732 --> 03:32.535
No wonder you and Dave are going
through a slump in your bedroom.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.263
Wha...

03:34.919 --> 03:36.518
Where did you hear that?

03:36.543 --> 03:37.799
Dave told Calvin.

03:37.824 --> 03:39.600
Why would he tell him?

03:39.625 --> 03:42.663
You've been wearing the same
damn bra for five days, Gemma!

03:44.474 --> 03:47.096
And, besides, I mean, he
asked us to babysit Grover

03:47.121 --> 03:49.721
so he can take you out
for your anniversary.

03:50.819 --> 03:52.143
Oh, my God.

03:52.168 --> 03:54.068
Our anniversary.

03:54.093 --> 03:56.158
I can't believe I forgot.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.390
You forgot your anniversary?

03:59.917 --> 04:01.674
What are you, a man?

04:03.614 --> 04:05.714
It's just, things have
been so crazy at work,

04:05.739 --> 04:08.374
and Grover's still
adjusting to the move.

04:08.399 --> 04:10.494
He's even started sleeping in our bed.

04:10.519 --> 04:12.345
Ooh, is Dave okay with that?

04:13.891 --> 04:17.184
Let me ask you this. You-you're
still attracted to Dave, right?

04:17.321 --> 04:19.136
Are you kidding?

04:20.613 --> 04:22.246
You've seen him.

04:22.271 --> 04:25.147
He looks exactly like Tom Cruise.

04:26.098 --> 04:28.987
Yeah. All right.

04:30.001 --> 04:33.268
Besides, come on, everyone
goes through lulls.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.404
Look,

04:39.429 --> 04:42.699
let us take Grover so you guys
can go out and celebrate.

04:42.724 --> 04:44.513
That is so nice of you. Thank you.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.976
You are welcome.

04:47.263 --> 04:50.751
So, you and Calvin really
never have any lulls?

04:50.776 --> 04:52.054
No.

04:54.868 --> 04:57.585
I mean, you've seen him.

05:00.023 --> 05:03.130
That man maintains his sexy.

05:03.155 --> 05:04.614
Mm.

05:04.697 --> 05:06.358
All right.

05:09.378 --> 05:11.277
Ooh, that must be Grover.

05:11.302 --> 05:12.739
Malcolm, get the door.

05:13.665 --> 05:16.566
I still don't know how you
convinced me to do this.

05:17.027 --> 05:18.572
Oh, you know.

05:21.381 --> 05:22.982
Hey, guys. Come on in.

05:23.007 --> 05:27.337
Hey. Thank you so much for
taking Grover overnight. Oh.

05:27.362 --> 05:29.877
You don't know how
important this is to us.

05:30.299 --> 05:32.791
Okay. Okay, Dave,

05:32.816 --> 05:34.870
save some for your wife, okay?

05:37.812 --> 05:40.274
Now, sweetie, everything's
gonna be just fine.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.432
If you need anything,
you ask Miss Tina.

05:42.457 --> 05:43.788
And if you get scared, don't worry,

05:43.813 --> 05:46.495
because Mommy is gonna
be right next door.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.380
'Kay. Bye.

05:49.301 --> 05:50.659
Okay, I think he's good.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.391
Let's make like Tom and cruise.

05:52.416 --> 05:54.423
Oh, oh. Um,

05:54.801 --> 05:57.491
wait, before we go, everything
he needs is in this bag:

05:57.516 --> 05:58.657
his blanket, his nightlight,

05:58.682 --> 06:00.048
and his rosemary eucalyptus candle

06:00.073 --> 06:01.575
that'll help him fall asleep.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.615
Time is a-wastin'.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.112
I think <i> The Firm</i> is about to premiere,

06:07.137 --> 06:08.687
if you know what I mean.

06:08.712 --> 06:10.038
I do.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.736
This is a nice candle.

06:17.761 --> 06:20.131
We're gonna keep this for ourselves.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.441
Are you ready?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.886
Ready.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.112
Ow!

06:31.137 --> 06:32.937
Oh, my God!

06:37.857 --> 06:40.399
I think I may have
over-waxed the floor.

06:42.530 --> 06:43.669
Well,

06:43.841 --> 06:45.107
for what it's worth,

06:45.176 --> 06:47.843
I think you're hotter than Tom Cruise.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.407
Thanks, babe.

06:49.432 --> 06:50.780
I think you're hotter
than Tom Cruise, too.

06:54.168 --> 06:56.235
- I love you.
- I love you.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.663
Oh, let me check that.

06:57.688 --> 06:58.687
It might be Grover.

06:58.756 --> 07:00.827
Hmm. Or maybe it's not.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.672
Uh, actually, it's about work. Hold on.

07:02.697 --> 07:04.555
Let me just respond real quick.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.047
Okay, yeah. Sure.

07:08.275 --> 07:10.542
Oh, that is so great.

07:10.567 --> 07:13.168
Anything I can do to help you relax.

07:13.236 --> 07:15.898
Oh, no, I was talking about
this grant approval.

07:17.928 --> 07:20.440
Okay, you know, s-since
it's our anniversary,

07:20.465 --> 07:23.800
maybe we put the phone down and
we-we focus on each other.

07:23.825 --> 07:26.020
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

07:26.522 --> 07:28.063
Here you go.

07:28.088 --> 07:29.564
To our anniversary.

07:29.589 --> 07:30.924
And our new home.

07:30.949 --> 07:33.475
And our first night alone
in it without Grover.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.805
- Aw, Grover.
- No, no.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.897
No, tonight is just about us.

07:37.922 --> 07:39.663
I-I didn't mean to mention Grover.

07:39.688 --> 07:41.962
Pretend you didn't hear that.
Pretend he doesn't exist.

07:41.987 --> 07:43.274
- Dave!
- No!

07:44.240 --> 07:46.168
Look, of course he exists.

07:46.193 --> 07:47.594
We love him. He's here with us.

07:47.619 --> 07:49.657
But, at the same time,
he's not, like a ghost.

07:49.901 --> 07:51.614
That's it. I'm gonna go check on him.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.252
Okay, no. Gemma, look.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.950
Look, I'm-I'm...

07:55.209 --> 07:56.509
I'm sorry.

07:57.038 --> 07:59.415
Can't we just have this night together?

08:00.067 --> 08:01.719
It's our anniversary.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.586
I miss you.

08:03.611 --> 08:06.175
Aw. I miss you, too.

08:08.658 --> 08:09.932
Okay, great.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.066
'Cause I have another surprise for you.

08:13.039 --> 08:16.124
Is it trying to juggle
bottles like in <i> Cocktail?</i>

08:16.149 --> 08:18.990
Because, last time, I wound
up in the emergency room.

08:22.674 --> 08:24.967
Oh, my God! Are those
what I think they are?!

08:24.992 --> 08:27.836
Your favorite Michigan cherry cupcakes,

08:27.861 --> 08:29.762
shipped fresh today,

08:29.787 --> 08:31.274
all the way from Kalamazoo.

08:31.299 --> 08:34.096
I love these!

08:34.380 --> 08:36.164
Grover and I used to
eat them all the time.

08:38.027 --> 08:39.793
Now, Grover, when the boys were young,

08:39.818 --> 08:42.669
we used to go around the table
and say what we're thankful for.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.044
So, I'll go first.

08:44.070 --> 08:47.482
I am thankful that you are
our guest this evening.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.185
Uh, I am thankful for <i> Star Wars.</i>

08:50.210 --> 08:51.348
Not the prequels.

08:51.373 --> 08:52.743
Those hurt my heart.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.768
Well, now that they have a black hero,

08:56.793 --> 08:58.673
I'm thankful for <i> Star Wars,</i> too.

08:59.173 --> 09:01.566
"Now"? What do you mean "now"?

09:01.591 --> 09:03.655
<i>Empire Strikes Back,</i> Lando Calrissian?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.426
You ain't got no love for Billy Dee?

09:05.703 --> 09:06.767
All right, all right.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.024
Listen up, you two.

09:08.093 --> 09:09.361
I'm-a tell you what I'm thankful for.

09:09.386 --> 09:12.053
My vasectomy. That's
what I'm thankful for.

09:13.501 --> 09:15.832
And family. And family.

09:16.447 --> 09:19.541
Um, Grover, what are you
thankful for, baby?

09:19.566 --> 09:20.441
Chicken fingers.

09:20.466 --> 09:21.998
Can I have some?

09:23.380 --> 09:25.725
Well, actually, I made catfish tonight.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.212
Yes.

09:27.237 --> 09:30.128
And the rule in our house
is that everyone eats

09:30.153 --> 09:31.886
what Miss Tina cooks.

09:31.911 --> 09:36.061
Well, can you ask Miss Tina
to cook some chicken fingers?

09:39.785 --> 09:42.046
Well, we don't have that.

09:42.071 --> 09:44.699
But I could probably whip you
up something real quick.

09:44.724 --> 09:45.823
What do you like?

09:45.936 --> 09:47.502
Maybe some spaghetti?

09:47.527 --> 09:48.626
Got that.

09:48.651 --> 09:50.052
With chicken fingers.

09:51.439 --> 09:53.231
Look, Grover,

09:53.256 --> 09:54.846
you're gonna eat your catfish
with the rest of us,

09:54.871 --> 09:56.304
and I bet you're gonna like it.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.073
I'll take that bet.

10:02.065 --> 10:03.852
Now, listen, little man,

10:03.877 --> 10:06.373
there are starving children
all around the world

10:06.398 --> 10:08.700
who would love a piece of
that delicious catfish.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.487
You're right. We should
give it to one of them.

10:14.532 --> 10:17.436
Coming to a hotel was such a good idea.

10:17.461 --> 10:19.099
But are you sure we can afford it?

10:19.124 --> 10:21.717
Even if it costs all the
money in the world,

10:21.742 --> 10:23.313
for you, it's worth it.

10:23.338 --> 10:24.503
Aw.

10:24.776 --> 10:26.258
Besides, I used miles, reward points,

10:26.283 --> 10:27.562
and I got a senior discount.

10:31.322 --> 10:33.629
As soon as we get upstairs,
I am gonna put on

10:33.654 --> 10:36.060
one of those fuzzy robes, run a bath,

10:36.085 --> 10:39.082
and eat $20 chocolates
from the minibar.

10:39.107 --> 10:41.241
And then we're gonna have sex?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.289
And then we're gonna have sex.

10:43.314 --> 10:44.401
Yes!

10:45.937 --> 10:47.332
No!

10:51.572 --> 10:53.005
Due to renovations,

10:53.030 --> 10:55.182
we are experiencing a power outage.

10:55.207 --> 10:56.135
Please stand by.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.880
And thank you for your patience.

10:57.905 --> 10:59.338
Renovations?

10:59.613 --> 11:00.791
Yeah.

11:00.816 --> 11:02.533
That's another reason
we got a discount.

11:03.321 --> 11:05.808
I knew we should have stayed home.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.712
Okay, babe, look, relax.

11:07.737 --> 11:09.462
How can I relax?

11:10.135 --> 11:11.535
Oh, my God.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.007
I don't have service.

11:13.032 --> 11:14.765
Grover could be calling me.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.369
People could be texting about work,

11:16.394 --> 11:18.877
and here I am trapped in a metal cage,

11:18.902 --> 11:21.141
ten stories up, waiting
to plunge to my death.

11:21.716 --> 11:24.278
First of all, we haven't
left the lobby.

11:24.774 --> 11:28.672
Second, I'm sure everything
is perfectly fine,

11:28.697 --> 11:30.740
especially Grover.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.657
Boy, you gonna sit here all night.

11:32.682 --> 11:34.317
I don't care if you starve.

11:35.951 --> 11:39.053
Who's ready for some cobbler?

11:39.078 --> 11:40.965
Oh, you know I am.

11:40.990 --> 11:43.574
Why do you think I wore
my "eatin'" pants today?

11:44.149 --> 11:45.478
I'll get the ice cream.

11:45.787 --> 11:46.753
Hold up.

11:46.778 --> 11:47.981
Cobbler a la mode?

11:48.006 --> 11:51.147
Okay. I'm just gonna lose
this drawstring altogether.

11:54.076 --> 11:55.770
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.393
What do you think you're
doing, little man?

11:58.418 --> 12:01.074
Having dessert, big man.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.565
No. No.

12:06.315 --> 12:08.581
Under this roof, you don't get dessert

12:08.606 --> 12:10.191
until you finish your dinner.

12:10.405 --> 12:11.649
Why?

12:11.674 --> 12:13.607
Because I said so.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.098
Welcome to Shawshank.

12:19.284 --> 12:21.389
But why is that the rule?

12:21.514 --> 12:25.647
Oh, you need a deeper
explanation of the rules.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.763
All righty, not a problem.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.789
Um, the reason is...

12:31.008 --> 12:33.059
because I said so.

12:34.819 --> 12:36.043
That's it.

12:36.068 --> 12:38.529
But that's not an answer.

12:38.554 --> 12:39.802
Excuse me?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.161
At my house, when I ask questions,

12:42.186 --> 12:44.496
my parents give me real answers.

12:45.730 --> 12:47.564
Long answers.

12:48.983 --> 12:52.267
Really long answers.

12:53.579 --> 12:58.035
Well, at my house, "because I said so"

12:58.225 --> 13:00.752
is the longest answer you're gonna get.

13:01.883 --> 13:04.305
Got it. One more question.

13:04.330 --> 13:05.609
Why?

13:07.319 --> 13:09.185
You see, Grover,

13:09.210 --> 13:10.582
ever since we were your age,

13:10.607 --> 13:12.490
it's been my dad's way or the highway.

13:12.744 --> 13:14.484
This one time, I asked
him if I could move

13:14.509 --> 13:16.509
my 9:00 bedtime to 10:00.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.800
And tell Grover what happened.

13:17.825 --> 13:19.397
It got pushed up to 8:00.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.730
You know, Pop, instead
of being a dictator,

13:22.755 --> 13:24.286
maybe you should try seeing things

13:24.311 --> 13:25.850
from other people's perspectives.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.160
Ooh, look. It's almost 8:00.

13:27.185 --> 13:29.470
Malcolm, you might want
to get ready for bed.

13:30.850 --> 13:33.164
Do you see what I mean?

13:33.189 --> 13:35.385
You know, maybe what this
house needs is a little

13:35.410 --> 13:36.902
civil disobedience.

13:36.927 --> 13:37.959
Grover,

13:37.984 --> 13:39.650
you do not have to eat that,

13:39.675 --> 13:40.974
and neither do I.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.693
In fact, none of us do.

13:42.718 --> 13:44.151
Am I right, Marty?

13:44.176 --> 13:45.645
- Uh-uh.
- Yes!

13:45.670 --> 13:46.836
Uh-uh, man.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.208
Mar... Yes.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.429
Now, I'm sorry, my brother.

13:51.454 --> 13:53.117
But we didn't land on this cobbler.

13:53.142 --> 13:54.602
This cobbler landed on us.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.919
Well, too bad for all of y'all,

13:57.944 --> 14:00.430
because this cobbler about
to land in my mouth.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.122
I'm gonna save us.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.337
How?

14:07.362 --> 14:08.574
Well, I'm gonna do exactly

14:08.599 --> 14:10.194
what Tom Cruise would
do in this situation.

14:10.659 --> 14:12.394
The only problem is,

14:12.419 --> 14:15.475
in <i> Mission Impossible,</i> he
had all these cool gadgets.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.040
In <i> Minority Report,</i> he had
futuristic technology.

14:18.159 --> 14:21.350
All I have is my quick
wit and quiet strength.

14:27.888 --> 14:31.067
You act like it's Tom doing it,
but it's really a stuntman.

14:31.092 --> 14:32.984
That's where you're wrong.
Tom does all his own stunts.

14:33.009 --> 14:34.503
That's what makes him Tom.

14:34.528 --> 14:36.357
And I'm gonna get us out of here.

14:36.382 --> 14:38.043
That's what makes me Dave.

14:38.998 --> 14:41.878
Okay.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.918
How does he make it look so easy?

14:48.301 --> 14:50.224
Mm-mm.

14:50.310 --> 14:53.333
Cobbler.

14:53.692 --> 14:56.714
It looks like y'all little
protest backfired, huh?

14:57.923 --> 14:59.695
More for me.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.512
This night couldn't get any better.

15:01.537 --> 15:03.526
Who's ready for ice cream?

15:03.551 --> 15:05.283
Ooh, I stand corrected.

15:07.047 --> 15:09.337
Don't be vanilla bean.
Don't be vanilla bean.

15:09.362 --> 15:11.285
- Is it vanilla bean? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.327 --> 15:15.590
So you're saying I can't get
any of this vanilla bean

15:15.615 --> 15:17.468
because of that vanilla bean?

15:19.353 --> 15:21.113
Just stay strong, my brother.

15:21.138 --> 15:22.204
What's going on?

15:22.229 --> 15:23.286
Oh, White Gandhi,

15:23.311 --> 15:24.556
Nerd Gandhi and Broke Gandhi

15:24.581 --> 15:26.434
are on a hunger strike.

15:28.152 --> 15:29.128
A hunger strike?

15:29.153 --> 15:30.447
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.472
We are tired of Pop's dictatorship.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.886
We demand democracy.

15:33.911 --> 15:34.910
And cobbler.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.547
Hot, bubbly cobbler
with-with-with-with cold,

15:39.572 --> 15:42.591
creamy ice cream, where-where
the cobbler starts

15:42.616 --> 15:44.543
to melt the ice cream ever so slightly.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.454
And-and real specks of vanilla beans

15:46.479 --> 15:50.111
start cascading down the
side of a peach, while my...

15:50.136 --> 15:52.424
Damn, man, just have a piece.

15:53.009 --> 15:54.953
Okay, and here you go.

15:54.978 --> 15:56.196
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.596
No, he doesn't get cobbler.

15:57.621 --> 15:59.666
He didn't even try his catfish.

15:59.691 --> 16:00.776
Ah, come on, baby.

16:00.801 --> 16:02.536
Give the boy some cobbler.
It's probably the first time

16:02.561 --> 16:04.227
he ever tried food with flavor.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.813
I don't care.

16:08.838 --> 16:10.520
The rules are the rules.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.169
And listen, little man,

16:12.194 --> 16:13.634
you may not understand this right now,

16:13.659 --> 16:15.112
but I'm trying to help you.

16:15.219 --> 16:17.459
This feels like the opposite.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.177
Look, Grover, you can't go through life

16:22.202 --> 16:23.962
with your mind already made up

16:23.987 --> 16:26.619
about things that you
like or don't like.

16:26.710 --> 16:27.862
You're going to miss out

16:27.887 --> 16:30.268
- on a lot of stuff.
- Like what?

16:30.821 --> 16:32.213
Well, look at Marty.

16:32.335 --> 16:35.297
He didn't like working on
cars when he was a kid,

16:35.322 --> 16:38.195
but I made him, and
that's where he started

16:38.220 --> 16:40.613
to enjoy working on machines.

16:40.664 --> 16:43.057
And that turned him into
a successful engineer.

16:43.511 --> 16:45.088
Wait a minute, Dad, are you
seriously taking credit

16:45.113 --> 16:47.051
for me becoming an engineer?

16:48.715 --> 16:51.015
And-and Malcolm hated books,

16:51.170 --> 16:52.473
but I made him read to me

16:52.498 --> 16:54.175
every day when I took him to school.

16:54.289 --> 16:55.752
We only lived a mile away,

16:55.777 --> 16:58.820
so it took us five
years to finish <i> Roots.</i>

17:00.166 --> 17:02.686
But then you started reading Malcolm X

17:02.711 --> 17:04.579
and Maya Angelou, and James Baldwin,

17:04.605 --> 17:07.369
and look at you, following
in their footsteps.

17:07.395 --> 17:08.694
Yeah? How?

17:08.719 --> 17:10.686
Organizing sit-ins.

17:11.146 --> 17:14.833
I mean, granted, it's for
little white kids, but still.

17:15.838 --> 17:17.798
Calvin, please, you're one to talk.

17:17.823 --> 17:19.486
You hate trying new things.

17:19.511 --> 17:20.577
That's not true.

17:20.602 --> 17:21.888
You just flipped out the other day

17:21.914 --> 17:24.208
when I put raspberry
vinaigrette on your salad.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.730
That's because dressings are
supposed to be creamy, Tina.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.978
Ranch, Thousand Island, blue cheese.

17:31.003 --> 17:33.757
If my carrot can't stand
up in it, I don't want it.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.181
Look, my point is,

17:39.361 --> 17:40.963
you don't know what you like

17:40.988 --> 17:43.685
until you at least give it a try.

17:44.302 --> 17:46.459
Okay. I'll try it.

17:46.484 --> 17:47.568
Oh.

17:47.593 --> 17:48.905
Okay.

17:49.309 --> 17:50.575
What do you think?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.688
Mmm. It's good.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.852
It tastes like chicken fingers.

17:57.638 --> 18:00.545
Now you can have some cobbler.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.099
Hey, way to stay strong, little man.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.327
You know, you are the
only kid to ever get more

18:05.352 --> 18:08.155
of an explanation than
"Because I said so."

18:09.454 --> 18:12.284
This is cause for celebration.

18:12.719 --> 18:14.152
Oh.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.724
What you think you're doing?

18:16.749 --> 18:18.133
Why can't I have some?

18:18.158 --> 18:20.479
Because I said so.

18:22.832 --> 18:25.766
I can't believe what a
disaster tonight is.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.888
Instead of taking your
mind off of things,

18:28.913 --> 18:30.579
I just made everything worse.

18:31.143 --> 18:32.976
No, you didn't.

18:33.554 --> 18:35.388
You did everything right.

18:35.642 --> 18:38.610
I don't know why I couldn't
just relax and enjoy it.

18:38.635 --> 18:40.334
Well, you got a lot going on.

18:40.359 --> 18:42.659
Yeah, but I always have a lot going on.

18:43.366 --> 18:45.398
I think this is something more.

18:45.466 --> 18:46.832
What do you mean?

18:48.380 --> 18:50.638
Was it wrong of me to
make us move here?

18:50.715 --> 18:51.914
What?

18:52.084 --> 18:53.353
I'm the one who got the job

18:53.378 --> 18:55.132
and made us move to California.

18:55.157 --> 18:56.533
I made us leave all of our family,

18:56.558 --> 18:58.631
our friends, Grover's school.

18:58.685 --> 19:00.752
I uprooted everything.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.590
Gemma, you didn't make us do anything.

19:03.615 --> 19:05.315
We decided together.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.880
Are you sure?

19:06.905 --> 19:11.499
Well, maybe it was 60-40, but...

19:11.945 --> 19:15.018
I was an enthusiastic 40.

19:15.594 --> 19:18.589
Dave, you're an
enthusiastic everything.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.085
We're a team, Gemma.

19:22.459 --> 19:24.290
Like Maverick and Goose?

19:25.923 --> 19:28.334
I've never loved you more.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.804
Ugh, I guess that makes me Goose.

19:30.829 --> 19:33.681
Well, yeah, look at me.
You're definitely Goose.

19:35.982 --> 19:38.101
Gemma, I'd follow you anywhere.

19:38.566 --> 19:41.167
All I ever want to be is close to you.

19:41.568 --> 19:43.214
I know, sweetie.

19:43.239 --> 19:44.481
I love you.

19:44.904 --> 19:46.678
And I love you.

19:49.051 --> 19:53.265
You know, even though this isn't
exactly what you had in mind,

19:53.798 --> 19:57.003
we are pretty close right now.

19:57.356 --> 19:59.159
We are, aren't we?

19:59.184 --> 20:00.701
What do you think?

20:01.386 --> 20:03.538
Goose, you big stud,

20:03.563 --> 20:06.700
take me to bed or lose me forever.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

20:17.467 --> 20:19.708
Oh, hey, Grover. What are
you doing out of bed?

20:19.733 --> 20:22.245
I couldn't sleep. Can you read to me?

20:22.881 --> 20:24.781
O-Of course. Let me...

20:24.806 --> 20:25.874
Uh-oh.

20:25.899 --> 20:28.710
Grover, whoa, whoa, whoa, little man.

20:29.114 --> 20:32.098
In this house, we all
stay in our own beds.

20:32.123 --> 20:33.301
Why?

20:33.326 --> 20:34.787
Because I said so.

20:34.827 --> 20:36.632
You know that doesn't work on me.
