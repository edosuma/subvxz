00:02.040 --> 00:04.960
- Look, I'm not that
good with words,

00:06.760 --> 00:08.320
but lemme tell you something.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.776
There are some stories
that just never go away

00:12.800 --> 00:14.576
like Romeo and Juliet.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.816
Two kids fall in love

00:15.840 --> 00:17.400
but the families can't
stand each other.

00:17.424 --> 00:18.784
That's sad but it happens.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.336
Everything happens.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.800
Everything's happened
before, dammit.

00:21.824 --> 00:22.824
Everything.

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
But imagine

00:26.920 --> 00:30.136
if something did happen
for the very first time,

00:30.160 --> 00:34.240
something that never happened
to anyone else before, ever.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.456
Man, wouldn't that be somethin'.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.280
Wouldn't you wanna get
all your friends around

00:43.304 --> 00:45.824
like you used to as a kid
on a Saturday afternoon?

00:46.536 --> 00:47.856
You know those
Saturday afternoons

00:47.880 --> 00:50.136
that used to last forever?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Except, hey.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.856
Except for that one kid
that never got invited

00:54.880 --> 00:56.360
and just watched
from a distance.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.896
You know what'd been a
first time for that kid?

00:59.920 --> 01:03.176
Someone saying, "Hey,
you wanna play?"

01:03.200 --> 01:04.480
"You wanna come see?"

01:09.800 --> 01:11.320
I wonder whatever
happened to that kid.

01:21.960 --> 01:25.376
- For a glass of water?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.560
Not big on the water, eh?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.536
- Which one is it, Barney?

01:38.560 --> 01:41.136
Are you intimidating or
provoking my client?

01:41.160 --> 01:42.776
- Hard to say.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.080
Whichever's the lesser of
the two evils I guess.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.680
- Give my regards to
the wife and kids.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.816
- Thank you.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.576
- Now, what are we
gonna do with you

02:02.600 --> 02:04.256
mister man with no name?

02:04.280 --> 02:07.000
You ride to town and you go
and get yourself caught.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.776
It's not quite the way the
story goes though, is it?

02:10.800 --> 02:13.016
Not the way I
remember it anyway.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.240
Alex and I would say
exactly that, actually.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.320
Anyway.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.640
So you're the devil.

02:24.080 --> 02:29.080
That's clever and kinda
funny, but it's also stupid.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.616
As a joke, my guess is
it's time to wear thin

02:33.640 --> 02:35.256
with about three seconds
of the punchline

02:35.280 --> 02:36.680
bein' delivered, my friend.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.856
Cops are a pretty
tough audience,

02:39.880 --> 02:41.616
but let me prove it to you.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.656
Because if they ask for
your name one more time

02:43.680 --> 02:48.296
and you say the Devil, they
gotta make up their mind

02:48.320 --> 02:51.536
that you're a risk to
yourself and the community.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.976
Whatever it is you're up to,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.536
you're gonna have to give
it up to sharing a cell.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.936
- Christoper Davidson.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.376
- Thank you.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.976
- No!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
That is not my name.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.400
You have a name for who I am.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.320
Christopher Davidson
was innocent.

03:07.344 --> 03:09.424
You should've helped
him more than you did.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.016
He was found guilty.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.760
You're a bad lawyer for
letting that happen.

03:13.784 --> 03:15.304
- The hell are you
talking about?

03:16.560 --> 03:21.456
Alright, do you know what a
transitional care facility is?

03:21.480 --> 03:23.816
It's where the cops want to
put you for a little while.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.936
A transitional care facility.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.856
They used to be called hospitals
and before that, nuthouses.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
You follow me?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.440
We've come a long
way, but you do not

03:32.464 --> 03:33.800
wanna be doing bed and breakfast

03:33.824 --> 03:35.840
with the self-harm and
hearing voices crowd.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.000
Work with me, yes?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
- I'm bored.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
- Excuse me?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.160
- I'm so bored, you
you can't imag...

03:56.800 --> 03:58.856
- I'll find some tissues.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.160
- You don't know what it's like.

04:00.184 --> 04:01.456
There is nothing to do!

04:01.480 --> 04:02.960
- Do you want to keep
your voice down?

04:02.984 --> 04:04.336
- I do wanna keep my voice down!

04:04.360 --> 04:05.576
I wanna keep my voice down

04:05.600 --> 04:07.016
as much as you wanna
fuck that girl

04:07.040 --> 04:08.416
young enough to
be your daughter!

04:08.440 --> 04:09.880
You see what I mean
when I get bored?

04:09.904 --> 04:12.096
I get desperate.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.839
- You listen to me, you lowlife.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.216
- The building has a history
that goes back to the reign

04:37.240 --> 04:40.120
of the English Queen Victoria
in the 19th century.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.256
It is a magnificent
colonial architecture

04:44.280 --> 04:47.120
and one of the oldest inhabited
buildings in the country.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.520
It's been a hospital only since
after the second World War.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.136
But you know what, though?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.640
It's been many, many
amazing things too.

05:04.600 --> 05:09.440
I believe Chris, you
once upon a time.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
Is everything okay?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.680
You good?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
- Good?

05:20.480 --> 05:22.016
No.

05:22.040 --> 05:27.040
That, I'm not but
thank you for asking.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.120
- Hey Paul.
- Hey Tom.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
- Alright,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
you good?

05:35.616 --> 05:36.616
- Good.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.376
- Excuse me, do you
think you're invisible?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
- No.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.856
- I'm glad because you're
definitely not that.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.160
In fact, you're
very hard to miss

06:12.184 --> 06:15.096
being as big and ugly as
you must know you are.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.296
- That was a joke?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.016
- Who told you that?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
- That's mean!

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
- Goodbye.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.136
- I'm not ugly, I've
got a girlfriend.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.640
- You haven't got a
girlfriend anymore

06:25.664 --> 06:27.376
and I've got two weeks to live.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
Come and sit down.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.160
Yeah don't breathe on me.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.840
Now what's your name?

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
- Take it back.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.176
- I'll think about it,
what's your name?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.976
- I used to have a girlfriend.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.216
- Did you?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.296
What was her name?

06:46.320 --> 06:47.320
- Rose.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.176
- Oh that's very original.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.696
Tell me when she was
your girlfriend,

06:52.720 --> 06:54.120
what was her boyfriend's name?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.776
That's right, think harder.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.680
It's a trick question
just like your head.

07:01.536 --> 07:02.536
- My head?

07:02.560 --> 07:03.976
- Mhm, this business up here.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.800
- I don't like you.
- Sit down!

07:17.920 --> 07:19.160
You didn't do it, did you?

07:21.720 --> 07:23.360
They said you did,
but you didn't.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
You didn't push him.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
He slipped.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
No one believed you.

07:36.016 --> 07:37.016
Poor Robbie.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.376
- I messed up.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.200
I'm so glad you believe me.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
They made me cry.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.536
I wouldn't have pushed anyone.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.656
They wouldn't listen to me.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.696
- That's because you're boring.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.240
Will you please go away, Robbie?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.936
- But you know!
- So I know

07:52.960 --> 07:55.456
where the Sahara Desert is,
but I'm not goin' there

07:55.480 --> 07:56.760
in need more of a
hurry than I am

07:56.784 --> 07:58.176
to continue this conversation.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.096
Will you please go away?

07:59.120 --> 08:00.456
I'm waiting to see a doctor.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.616
- Please be my friend?

08:01.640 --> 08:03.256
- No, you're ugly!

08:03.280 --> 08:05.600
Besides, you lied to me when
you said you had a girlfriend.

08:05.624 --> 08:07.360
You were lying to me,
weren't you, Robbie?

08:07.384 --> 08:09.256
- No, now Rose was
always my girlfriend.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.480
But then the accident happened

08:10.504 --> 08:12.816
and they said I couldn't
ring her anymore.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.336
- Almost your girlfriend.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.376
Well what say you make
me almost your friend?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.176
But better still,
what say you make me

08:19.200 --> 08:21.016
almost your best friend?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.320
Almost your best friend
in the whole wide world.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.320
Now Robbie, if I say I'm
goin' to be your friend,

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
will you go away?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.320
- Oh mister, I'm so
happy you're my friend.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.655
I ain't gonna stay with
Jesus, I don't care.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.535
'Cause I got my own friend now!

08:40.559 --> 08:42.696
You're my friend now, Mista!

08:42.720 --> 08:45.256
- Robbie, talk to me.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.336
You just said
Jesus, as in Jesus?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.496
Why?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.056
- Some other people here
sayin' they're Jesus,

08:52.080 --> 08:52.856
but they're not.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.656
I lie.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.936
What do you reckon?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.280
They say they're Jesus
and people believe them.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.216
I don't believe them.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.216
That's why I haven't
got any friends

09:03.240 --> 09:05.320
'cause they're all friends,
but I don't believe them.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.184
That's why I haven't
got any friends.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.256
You know how know
they're not Jesus?

09:10.280 --> 09:11.536
How come I know?

09:11.560 --> 09:13.256
- I was about do ask
you exactly that.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.376
- Because I'm a carpenter,
just like the real Jesus.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.256
They don't have a trade.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.456
I did my apprenticeship,
I went to trade school.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.416
I'm fully qualified!

09:23.440 --> 09:26.456
- Robbie, did I say
you're boring?

09:26.480 --> 09:28.536
You're right, you
don't need them.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.336
Let's show them how
much we don't need them

09:30.360 --> 09:32.176
by showing off our
brand new friendship.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.536
But most of all, let's
show it off too for Jesus

09:35.560 --> 09:37.280
that did not go to trade school.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.080
Them first.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.280
Thank you.

09:55.216 --> 09:56.576
But I was expecting
it to turn red.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.000
I thought you said you were
turning water into wine.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
- It's a metaphor.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.200
I really didn't turn water
into wine in the Bible,

10:04.224 --> 10:06.056
I simply replaced the
old faith with new.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.376
Transformed the
commonplace into eternal.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.496
But just for a minute there

10:11.520 --> 10:13.696
as I was pourin' the
water into the glass,

10:13.720 --> 10:16.360
because you expect it to
become wine, it was wine.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.816
The metaphor became
reality and that's faith.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.416
You take that minute and you
multiply it to the nth degree,

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
you have faith.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.536
- Mmm, what'd you
say your name was?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.296
- Jesus.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.336
- What'd you say his name was?

10:36.360 --> 10:37.360
- Lawrence Turner.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.160
- Thank you for your
time today, Mr Turner.

10:40.184 --> 10:41.856
It's been a tremendous priv...

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
- Repent!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.696
- I think he's talkin' to you.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
Knock again.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.480
- Bud, you're not
wearin' your watch.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.520
- It must've fallen off when
I was doin' the dishes.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.240
- That's bad!
- Repent!

11:41.440 --> 11:43.416
- I told you he was
talkin' to you.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.440
- Repent!

11:48.160 --> 11:50.496
- You have quite a
theme going on here.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.000
Now I don't mean just
your vocabulary,

11:52.024 --> 11:54.016
I'm talking more along
the lines of the decor.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.520
Don't even think about it!

12:07.280 --> 12:09.816
- Repent, repent, repent!

12:16.480 --> 12:17.576
- You listen to me.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.416
If the next Jesus so
much as mentions water,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.096
let alone demonstrates
using water

12:21.120 --> 12:22.856
or even just tries
to lead me to water

12:22.880 --> 12:24.896
like the beast of burden
you're very quickly

12:24.920 --> 12:26.176
turnin' me into,

12:26.200 --> 12:29.296
I want you to know I
am goin' to kill you.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.456
Just on principle
and just in case.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.696
Yes I think I could see
the problem here already.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.736
- Who are you looking for?

12:45.760 --> 12:48.136
- Oh we're not, but thank you.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.160
- No, wait!

12:50.200 --> 12:51.560
It's because I'm a
woman, isn't it?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.416
Why can't I be Jesus?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.136
- Who said you can't?

12:57.160 --> 12:58.976
Don't believe them.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.560
I'm sure it's in
the Constitution.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.936
- You came in looking
for someone?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.456
- Did we?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.896
Ah yes, my friend here's
tryin' to find enlightenment.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.576
We're looking for Buddha.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.696
He's a big fat guy
with a bald head.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.840
- That's very
offensive, you know?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.560
Some people find truth
in Eastern religion.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.760
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.656
- Excuse me, could I ask
you to stand still please?

14:00.680 --> 14:02.400
You're makin' me rather seasick.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.760
- He doesn't like water.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.576
- Why don't you sit down?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.120
- Seasick, seagulls, swim.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.600
Swim, swim, sweat.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
Sweet 16.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.600
When you're 16, you think
you know everything.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.696
Until everything stops, that is.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.616
Which is exactly what
happened early one morning

14:27.640 --> 14:30.296
when a 16 year old girl woke up

14:30.320 --> 14:33.000
to find that a statue
in her room was crying.

14:34.600 --> 14:38.016
A statue that her
mother put there.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.760
The statue that right
now was crying.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.896
But hang on a minute, I just
said that already didn't I?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.216
Well it is a bit of a big deal.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.576
Statues don't exactly do
that kinda thing, right?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.080
They don't exactly
do any kinda thing.

14:51.104 --> 14:52.736
Just stand there and be statues

14:52.760 --> 14:54.456
and look good or bad
or holy or whatever.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.280
I don't know, but nor
did the teenage girl.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.880
Talk about lost.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.680
But when all else fails...

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
- Text someone.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.480
- So she did

15:14.680 --> 15:16.160
with the statue with
tears in its eyes

15:16.184 --> 15:17.896
looking on, of course.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.176
Still looking on
and still crying

15:20.200 --> 15:21.480
as that teenage girl got dressed

15:21.504 --> 15:23.064
in something like record time.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.440
But not much to see here people,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.736
just truly terrified
teenage girl

15:29.760 --> 15:32.896
skipping breakfast
and missin' the bus.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.920
That sucks, but it wasn't far
to her boyfriend's house.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.400
They walked the rest of the
way to school together.

15:41.424 --> 15:43.184
Hand-in-hand, young love.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.680
Clueless.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.456
Clueless too, as I walked
through the school guides

15:49.480 --> 15:52.536
and almost directly right
into the school priest.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.440
Now he could tell somethin' was
wrong, priests always can.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.496
So I explained.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.720
Of course he'd heard it all
before, priests always have.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.320
But not this.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.056
They have never seen
anything like this before.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.296
Standing there in
the girl's bedroom

16:10.320 --> 16:12.456
starin' the statue
straight in the eye,

16:12.480 --> 16:14.376
it was staring
straight back at 'em

16:14.400 --> 16:16.240
through tears still
in both its eyes.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.280
A crying statue staring
up at a priest

16:21.480 --> 16:24.520
and a priest staring
down at a crying statue

16:26.480 --> 16:27.520
of Marilyn Monroe.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.920
- It's on the table, guys.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.136
- Robbie, who's your new friend?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.880
- I could ask the same question,

16:53.200 --> 16:54.200
but I won't.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.136
Robbie save me a
seat, I'm starving.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.616
In fact I am so hungry,
you can't imagine.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.360
- Yeah, you want me to go now?

17:03.960 --> 17:05.720
- Well how the hell else
are you gonna manage

17:05.743 --> 17:06.695
to save me a seat?

17:06.720 --> 17:09.480
- Listen to million
dollar haircut, will you?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.680
You gotta love the
mouth on this guy.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.240
You're going nowhere, dude.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
What a mouth.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Are we going?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.175
- I won't be long, guys.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.080
- Is she the funny one, is she?

17:49.120 --> 17:50.440
I'd hear or something.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.856
I'm not sure I counted
12 back there,

17:53.880 --> 17:55.576
but she certainly
did do very well

17:55.600 --> 17:57.120
to stand out though, didn't she?

17:58.080 --> 18:00.176
Now who are the other ones?

18:00.200 --> 18:04.336
Sneezy, sleepy, bashful,

18:04.360 --> 18:06.576
boring, irritating, gullible?

18:06.600 --> 18:07.856
- You sound like a little bit

18:07.880 --> 18:09.856
of a dab hand at
comedy yourself.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.200
- Mister...
- No I think we better

18:11.224 --> 18:13.576
clear up the question
of your name first.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.120
- I'm Jesus.
- You paused.

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
What are you afraid of?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.480
Are you worried
they're going to say

18:24.504 --> 18:26.024
you're crazy and lock you up?

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
- No.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.600
Did you know I
think he's scared?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.656
The fact that the architect
who designed this place

18:35.680 --> 18:38.016
laid out the corridors
in such a way,

18:38.040 --> 18:40.776
the smell from the kitchen
carries right through

18:40.800 --> 18:42.080
and just lingers.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.856
Mmm, chicken.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.656
Do you like chicken?

18:45.680 --> 18:46.896
I like chicken.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.240
- I'd so like to say a prayer
for the same thing that...

19:24.240 --> 19:25.880
- What's wrong with your hands?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.896
- I'd like to say a
prayer for the same thing

19:49.920 --> 19:51.936
that I said a prayer
for yesterday

19:51.960 --> 19:53.880
because yesterday I
left something out.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.976
I forgot to mention
that the boys are going

19:57.000 --> 19:59.216
on the road to
promote the single

19:59.240 --> 20:02.296
and being boys they're
obviously going nowhere.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.096
They're obviously gonna need
all the help they can get.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.360
So God, can you please make
sure that they don't fuck up

20:09.880 --> 20:12.536
and that they don't turn
up stoned to interviews?

20:12.560 --> 20:16.536
Can you please, please,
please make sure

20:16.560 --> 20:19.216
they don't make
dicks of themselves

20:19.240 --> 20:23.016
by sliding off other bands or
getting release dates wrong

20:23.040 --> 20:25.016
or hitting on girl interviewers

20:25.040 --> 20:26.936
or any of the
bullshit like that?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.656
One last thing, can
you do something

20:30.680 --> 20:34.016
about the radio stations
that play our song?

20:34.040 --> 20:38.496
The hardcore stations,
not the wanker ones.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.560
They can go keep playing
with themselves.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That's me.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.160
- Thanks, Beth.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.960
I hope God has an open mind.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.800
- Actually could
I say something?

20:59.720 --> 21:00.840
- Please.
- Thank you.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.536
I'd like to say a prayer...

21:07.560 --> 21:09.936
Is that how you
start it, I hope?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.200
- Yeah that'll do just fine.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.416
- Gonna be quite short,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.080
not having a religious
upbringing and all.

21:17.104 --> 21:18.224
- Just say the prayer.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.976
- I'd like to say a
prayer for anyone

21:28.000 --> 21:30.120
who isn't sitting down
to a meal right now.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.056
For anyone who doesn't
have food on a table

21:34.080 --> 21:37.240
or clean water to drink or
warm clothes on their back

21:38.560 --> 21:39.920
or a roof over their head.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.400
Where every day is a
struggle, every day.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.496
A prayer for people
from countries

21:49.520 --> 21:52.080
that are in every other
country's too hard basket.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.000
Countries decimated by war.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.120
Countries decimated by corruption,
by famine, by plague.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.760
Countries where either
that doesn't rain enough

22:04.784 --> 22:05.936
or it rains too much.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.000
A prayer for the children
of those countries.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.136
We're talkin' children that'll
never take their first step

22:11.160 --> 22:12.936
because they'll never
have the energy

22:12.960 --> 22:15.176
to lift their tiny bodies
up off the ground.

22:15.200 --> 22:19.576
Where mothers weak with hunger
can no longer produce milk

22:19.600 --> 22:21.136
to breastfeed their children.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.616
It's all and well good for
us to sit here and ask

22:22.640 --> 22:24.936
why would you wanna bring a
child into a world like that?

22:24.960 --> 22:27.600
All because there just isn't
enough food to go around.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.600
Thank you for letting
me say my peace.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
I'm sorry.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.816
Chicken, I like chicken.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.736
Od you like chicken?

22:48.760 --> 22:52.096
Robbie, where's my coloring?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.776
Robbie, we won't
have any coloring.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.576
No no, that's not
my color Robbie.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.536
Give that back.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.096
Go get my coat, it's over there.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.216
That's it.

25:25.480 --> 25:26.480
- Hey.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.280
Are you hungry?

25:31.960 --> 25:33.240
If you change your mind.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.360
I think...

26:06.280 --> 26:08.536
Actually no, I'm sure I've done

26:08.560 --> 26:11.336
more graveyard shifts
than anyone else.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.600
But tonight's the first night
I've ever really felt afraid.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.880
I can't work it out.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.256
I feel like someone's just
told me the place is haunted

26:21.280 --> 26:22.880
and I didn't know that before.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.600
Maybe it's just the cold.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.600
- So it's ghosts now, is it?

26:35.040 --> 26:38.200
- I didn't say I saw a
ghost, thank you very much.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.280
I'm really scared,
that's not funny.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.880
I'm overworked and underpaid,
feel sorry for me.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.720
Thank you.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.960
I am scared, you know.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
Adele?

27:04.840 --> 27:05.840
- I can't.

27:08.440 --> 27:09.440
- Adele.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
- Please leave.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.096
- I wasn't trying to
get you to go to bed.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.280
- Please, just go.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.720
- Goodnight, Beth.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
- Shh.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.960
- Beth, that song you were
playing there are some people...

31:23.520 --> 31:24.656
There are some people who
are good at what they do,

31:24.680 --> 31:26.576
then there are others who
tear their heart out

31:26.600 --> 31:28.576
and put it on display and say,

31:28.600 --> 31:31.680
"I dare you to get
closer than that."

31:33.040 --> 31:35.520
- That's a good thing, right?

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
I'm tired.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.296
- Now that wasn't
fair though, was it?

31:50.320 --> 31:51.696
I've got it right
though, didn't I?

31:51.720 --> 31:54.376
It was exactly was you
were about to say.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.720
That always takes
so much outta me

31:55.744 --> 31:56.680
and it's always such a
hard one to manage,

31:56.704 --> 31:58.616
but the look on your face.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.496
Like I wish I had a cloth or
handkerchief or something

32:01.520 --> 32:03.496
because then I could wipe
that look off your face

32:03.520 --> 32:06.376
then I'd get to keep it
forever, wouldn't I?

32:06.400 --> 32:07.400
Jesus?

32:08.760 --> 32:09.960
- You know what?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.160
You can call me Ben.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.816
Welcome back.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.056
- Is it Friday yet?

33:45.080 --> 33:47.480
- How's your mom?

33:48.600 --> 33:49.760
- She died.
- What?

33:51.720 --> 33:53.976
- She's mom, what do
you want me to say?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.320
- Funny, you're a funny guy.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.296
Hey, we should wake up
Veronica there, yeah?

34:00.320 --> 34:01.576
- Yeah sure, I'll do it

34:01.600 --> 34:03.456
but I think I'm gonna
have a coffee first.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.880
- Yeah sure, do you
want me to wait?

34:04.904 --> 34:06.976
- Nah, but I do wanna know is

34:07.000 --> 34:08.960
have you broken the in?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.536
How are things goin' with you

34:12.560 --> 34:15.376
and little miss porn's worse
than third-world poverty?

34:15.400 --> 34:18.735
- No no no, she's a
lady friend of mine.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.880
It's nothin' like that.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.775
- Lady friend.
- Yeah.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.896
- Man, where do you come
up with this stuff?

34:24.920 --> 34:27.176
- What do you mean?
- Lady friend.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.880
This isn't Knights
of the Round Table.

34:30.840 --> 34:31.840
M'lady.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.200
- Welcome to the
jungle, good people.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.960
As for our dude with a story to
tell, well here's the thing.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.320
I was kinda stuck for
a story that day,

35:15.344 --> 35:17.184
just didn't wanna happen

35:19.880 --> 35:20.960
until she came along.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.216
When he first saw her, he
was sitting by the window

35:25.240 --> 35:28.216
waiting for inspiration to
slap him across the face

35:28.240 --> 35:30.240
like he was some drunk
on a dance floor.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.696
She changed all that.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.680
She was so beautiful.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.720
She never even knew
he was up there.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
He watched her pass by, seemed
to stop for just a moment

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
and then disappear.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.016
That's all it took.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.456
He didn't sleep for 24 hours,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.896
making notes and
scribbling ideas.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.016
But most of all tryin'
to come up with a title.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.280
You see, the title always
had to come first.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.800
Then it came to him,

36:03.240 --> 36:06.400
his new screenplay was gonna
be called A Rumor of Angels.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.816
You had a man and the
name that came to him

36:10.840 --> 36:13.960
almost exactly 24 hours
after he'd first seen her.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.376
In fact, he was even
sitting right where he was

36:17.400 --> 36:18.720
when he'd first seen her.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.456
Everything was almost
exactly the same.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.880
He watched her pass by, seemed
to pause for just a moment

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
and then disappear.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.256
In an instant, he went from
just a title to a whole story.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.960
An entire screenplay
from start to finish

36:37.920 --> 36:40.880
and by morning, it was finished.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.936
Now that's two days
without sleep,

36:43.960 --> 36:46.376
so he crashed and then wake up.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.320
Woke up at, guess what time?

36:49.840 --> 36:52.800
Yup, at the same time the
woman walked past each day.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.256
He watched her pass by
and then looked down

36:57.280 --> 36:58.400
at A Rumour of Angels.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.376
He knew it was good and he
had to get it out there,

37:03.400 --> 37:04.976
so he emailed it out to anyone

37:05.000 --> 37:06.400
who even sounded
like they mattered,

37:06.424 --> 37:09.216
who might just care enough
to read his screenplay

37:09.240 --> 37:10.920
by a guy that no
one even heard of.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.960
So he sent it off and
forgot all about it

37:17.440 --> 37:21.000
until a knock at the door
only a few days later.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.176
It was some big
name movie producer

37:25.200 --> 37:27.976
and he wanted to make
A Rumour of Angels.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.696
A few months later,
he did exactly that.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.016
Now it had everybody in it
and it did not too badly.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.656
Not number one box office ever,

37:35.680 --> 37:38.056
but certainly number
two or three.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.096
Ever.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.656
People started quoting
lines from it.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.136
People started coming back
to see it again and again.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.360
In fact about the only
person who hadn't seen it

37:47.600 --> 37:50.576
was the guy who'd
written the thing.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.976
You see, he never
left the window there

37:55.000 --> 37:56.640
because she never let him down.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.400
Every day at exactly
the same time,

38:02.240 --> 38:06.120
there she was and that's all
that mattered to him now,

38:09.120 --> 38:12.680
until the Oscars threatened
to ruin everything

38:14.536 --> 38:15.976
and that's because
A Rumour of Angels

38:16.000 --> 38:17.696
was nominated for everything.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.416
You know what that meant?

38:19.440 --> 38:21.096
Our dude had to go.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.400
Oh boy, not good.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.816
Even the Oscars means
not at the window,

38:25.840 --> 38:27.296
but what choice did he have?

38:27.320 --> 38:29.840
His producers already sent him
a new suit and a limousine,

38:31.840 --> 38:32.960
but he didn't get far.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.776
The limousine that was
carrying him was cut off

38:37.800 --> 38:40.120
by an ambulance before it got
to the end of the street.

38:42.640 --> 38:47.576
Two paramedics rushed past,
he followed them to a house.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.840
You could hear a woman crying.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.016
He found the woman standing
behind the paramedics

38:57.040 --> 38:59.176
tryin' to revive another woman.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.120
A woman who's facing you.

39:04.880 --> 39:05.880
It was her.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.960
The woman that had
passed by his window

39:08.984 --> 39:10.104
every day for so long.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.200
She had taken her own life.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.120
He watched them cover her face.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.736
He needed answers.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.160
He turned to the crying woman,

39:27.320 --> 39:30.216
the dead woman, the woman
he knew and loved.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.760
She said, "It was an actress."

39:34.400 --> 39:35.880
"I had been an actress."

39:37.480 --> 39:41.176
A Rumour of Angels, that was
so gonna be her big break.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.096
Five times they made her
audition and in the end,

39:44.120 --> 39:46.200
they gave the part to
some lingerie model.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
Broke her spirit.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.160
The reason they gave her
for not getting the part,

39:59.240 --> 40:01.160
"You're just not
beautiful enough."

40:06.160 --> 40:07.240
- Oh that's so sad.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.040
That's not fair!

40:14.160 --> 40:15.696
No, that's...

40:15.720 --> 40:16.496
- No!
- Robbie.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.856
- No!

40:17.880 --> 40:18.880
That's so sad.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.136
- Robbie!
- It's so sad!

40:21.160 --> 40:22.256
- Chill, dude.
- No!

40:22.280 --> 40:23.760
That's not fair.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.120
That's so sad.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.960
It's not fair.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.640
- There is somethin'
wrong with him.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.600
He's not right.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.496
The rest of us, we're
just doing it tough.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.656
But he's not right, look at him.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.280
That should be
locked up alright.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.856
My God, if you could
only see yourselves.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.200
Who do you think you are?

40:58.960 --> 40:59.960
He's just a big kid.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.776
He just misses his mother.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.760
You just wanna lock him up
and throw away the key.

41:04.784 --> 41:06.096
Actually why don't you do that?

41:06.120 --> 41:07.816
Why don't you fight
amongst yourself

41:07.840 --> 41:11.096
to see who gets first go
of throwing away the key?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
What about you?

41:14.240 --> 41:15.240
You?

41:17.280 --> 41:22.040
Someone must wanna be the
first to throw away the key.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.040
Anyone?

41:25.480 --> 41:26.480
Someone?

41:28.320 --> 41:31.296
Someone must want first go
of throwing away that key.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.160
Someone must wanna
go first, someone.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.280
- Christopher Davidson.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.040
- Find the infamous?

42:09.064 --> 42:10.296
- No, it wasn't time.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.560
Could be that I've represented
him by another name.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.680
I think he is,
could be an alias.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.080
I don't know.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.016
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.376
I've gotta [shoot through
every name I've got on file.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.400
There's a lot there.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.416
What's tomorrow, Thursday?

42:27.440 --> 42:30.096
I'll get my secretary
to make it happen.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.640
- You doin' her?

42:32.800 --> 42:33.816
- What?

42:33.840 --> 42:35.120
- Man, your secretary.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.256
- Do you actually
work at being cliche?

42:38.280 --> 42:40.736
- Oh you mean the grubby
Private I routine?

42:40.760 --> 42:42.296
Yeah, fuck yeah.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.160
You don't have to have courses,
so practice for hours.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.896
So what are we doin' dredgin'
through your client database

42:49.920 --> 42:51.000
lookin' for this guy?

42:52.400 --> 42:53.456
- Christopher Davidson.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.840
- Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.216
- That's where his name came up.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.376
- Yeah, by who?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.976
- Some twit, it doesn't matter.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.360
- Ah, of course it doesn't.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.200
Yeah, lucky for you to
pick up the phone and me

43:03.224 --> 43:06.256
knowing that the sound of
your voice fucks with me.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.440
Fucks with me hard.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.256
- I've got no answer.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.360
His name came up and I
need to know who he is.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.056
- If you gave him
your woman's name.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.840
I guess that was helpin' you
find the one that got away.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.840
- I think I know where
you're goin' with this.

43:22.864 --> 43:25.544
- I'm not, actually
but how is she?

43:26.280 --> 43:29.576
Still has a preference for a guy

43:29.600 --> 43:32.416
that can provide her with
stability and security?

43:32.440 --> 43:34.176
You still worrying
about your love?

43:34.200 --> 43:35.200
- Sorry.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.376
- That's alright.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.216
- Half past six at court six?
- That's perfect, thanks.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.816
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

43:41.840 --> 43:42.840
- Bye.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
I wonder.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
You want me to find a
Christopher Davidson.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.680
Do you want me to find him

43:57.160 --> 43:58.840
as much as you wanna
fuck that girl

44:00.040 --> 44:01.320
young enough to
be your daughter?

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
I wonder.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.120
- Okay, so have you tried
retracing your steps?

44:10.440 --> 44:12.056
How 'bout the game store?

44:12.080 --> 44:13.680
- No, I've looked
everywhere for my diary

44:13.704 --> 44:15.576
but I still can't
figure out where it is.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.136
- Come on, let's
give it another go.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.840
- I know we'll find it.
- Mmkay.

44:23.496 --> 44:24.496
Ooh my God.

44:24.520 --> 44:29.400
- Surprise!

44:30.496 --> 44:31.496
- Happy birthday.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.176
- Ooh thank you.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.416
Oh my God, wow!

44:35.440 --> 44:36.880
Does Doc Lucas know about this?

44:38.320 --> 44:40.616
- In a manner of speaking,
I believe she does.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.416
Gotta keep a watchful
eye on things.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.536
- Of course.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.776
- She's talkin' about
me, right Doc?

44:45.800 --> 44:46.616
Happy birthday, beautiful lady.

44:46.640 --> 44:47.640
- Ooh, thank you.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.056
This is all you, right?

44:51.080 --> 44:52.080
- Try again.

44:55.960 --> 44:56.960
- Beth?

44:58.080 --> 45:01.120
Where is Beth?
- Yeah, where is Beth?

45:01.960 --> 45:02.960
- Oh my God!

45:03.856 --> 45:04.856
- Happy birthday, girl!

45:08.960 --> 45:10.480
- Beth, I love you.

45:12.400 --> 45:17.096
♪ I'd like to say I got
a hole in my heart ♪

45:17.120 --> 45:20.696
♪ I want you to know

45:20.720 --> 45:21.616
- Are you happy?

45:21.640 --> 45:23.776
- Oh thank you so much, yes.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.896
- And thank you Doc
Lucas, you rock!

45:28.920 --> 45:31.416
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much

45:31.440 --> 45:33.456
for letting me invite the boys.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.200
I had to tear them away
from groups of girls

45:35.224 --> 45:36.880
that were throwing
underwear at them.

45:36.904 --> 45:38.856
- G-strings, actually.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.600
Maybe I better shut up.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.560
- That's Dan Nelson, everybody.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.816
He's on lead vocals,
as you can tell.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.376
Mainly because he's
got such a big mouth.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.616
- Woo, woo!

46:03.440 --> 46:08.216
- Anyway, on rhythm
guitar we got Mr Claudio.

46:08.240 --> 46:12.496
Ooh, as his note to his
friend plain ol' Claude.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.656
Yay!

46:18.120 --> 46:21.176
And on bass guitar, we've
got Mr Jamie King!

46:21.200 --> 46:23.856
Yay!

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
Shh, shh.

46:26.560 --> 46:30.000
And on drums, you
know what we've got?

46:43.640 --> 46:46.520
We've got our very own
private little drummer boy.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.856
He's only 17, so you have
to be very, very quiet

46:51.880 --> 46:53.640
so that you don't
scare him away.

46:54.880 --> 46:57.216
If there are any cradle
snatchers out there,

46:57.240 --> 46:58.800
keep your hands to yourself

47:00.040 --> 47:01.880
because I'm waiting
for him to grow up.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.416
Mr Jesse Stuart, everybody!

I'm pretty sure she
is though, actually.

50:46.160 --> 50:51.160

50:54.160 --> 50:55.776
Why are we laughing?

50:55.800 --> 50:56.776
Are you okay, baby?

50:56.800 --> 50:58.600
Did you hit your head?

50:59.920 --> 51:04.416
- We'd have died, then this
would've gone to waste.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.160
- Now, you were saying?

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
I can't.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.896
- Why?

51:24.920 --> 51:27.216
Baby, I don't know.

51:27.240 --> 51:31.216
I want to.

51:31.240 --> 51:35.736
I just don't want
to risk it, 'kay?

51:35.760 --> 51:38.920

look off your face.

51:42.440 --> 51:47.440
I like to watch.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.936
You know that I love you so much

51:53.960 --> 51:55.800
because you're going
nowhere, right?

51:57.840 --> 52:00.280
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?

52:05.440 --> 52:06.440
Cute.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.856
- You're hurting me.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.760
Please!

53:23.080 --> 53:24.720
- Now I gets to kiss it better.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.416
But if you think
about it is really

53:27.440 --> 53:30.880
all she wanted all along.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.280
- Good news is it backs
up the defense argument

54:19.304 --> 54:20.704
that we'll be presenting.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.856
So it's consistent
with the context

54:23.880 --> 54:26.016
we'll be working to establish.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.616
Our line of arguments will be

54:27.640 --> 54:29.936
that a key contributing
factor here

54:29.960 --> 54:31.896
is that Chris has
himself been a victim

54:31.920 --> 54:33.080
of bullying in the past.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.640
That's going to help us
to explain his behavior.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.976
- Is this your idea of fun?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.856
- Didn't mean it.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.136
- I guess you don't like us.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.880
- No of course he doesn't.
- No, I get that.

54:45.904 --> 54:47.664
But he did decide
he didn't mean it.

54:48.560 --> 54:50.816
The way my mind works is
that maybe it was dark

54:50.840 --> 54:52.160
and he might've
been driving home,

54:52.184 --> 54:54.456
the dog ran out in front of it.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
What did you use?

54:56.320 --> 54:57.656
What was it?

54:57.680 --> 54:59.400
A branch, a bat?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.056
- It's just some dog.

55:02.080 --> 55:03.480
- Oh that's a good answer, good.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.800
I can see the judge
very quickly.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.000
So you be good boy and tell 'em
exactly what happened, okay?

55:12.560 --> 55:14.440
It was just some dog,
you didn't meet it.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.936
Make sure you got that
stupid grin on your face

55:19.960 --> 55:22.176
when you tell your
heartwarming story.

55:22.200 --> 55:23.200
- Hey, come on.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.456
- What a weirdo,
I'm telling dad.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.776
- Shut up, Chris!

55:26.800 --> 55:28.176
- He's not your son?

55:28.200 --> 55:30.360
- Mr D Stefano is
Christopher's stepfather.

55:30.384 --> 55:31.936
- It's Chris!

55:31.960 --> 55:33.056
- Chris what?

55:33.080 --> 55:36.816
Christopher what?

55:36.840 --> 55:38.520
- You need help, buddy.
- Christopher what?

55:38.544 --> 55:39.664
- Christopher Herring.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.496
- Boo.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.160
- Hey, good morning.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.720
Sorry, I thought you'd
still be sleeping.

56:01.744 --> 56:03.544
- No, what's up?

56:04.440 --> 56:05.976
- You ever visit him?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.336
- Who?

56:07.360 --> 56:11.000
- I think he said he's
from a magazine, I think.

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
That's for you.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.800
- Oh my God, did he
say what he wanted?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.080
- There's one way to find out.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.040
- Do you think I could go
like this, you reckon?

56:33.880 --> 56:35.296
- You've always looked the part.

56:35.320 --> 56:38.240
- And you always know the
right thing to say, you dork.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.840
Oh, maybe I should put
some underwear on.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.976
- Now what I wanna do
is ask you to let me

56:53.000 --> 56:55.896
put you in touch with a guy who
speaks the digital language.

56:55.920 --> 56:59.056
I'm thinkin' of one
guy in particular.

56:59.080 --> 57:01.336
This guy's got the
smarts and he knows it.

57:01.360 --> 57:02.736
He's created a
career for himself

57:02.760 --> 57:04.856
doin' what no one else is doing.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.096
He knows your stuff.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.376
- Okay.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.056
- I introduced him to it
and I'll tell you why.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.056
Because it lends
itself perfectly

57:12.080 --> 57:14.656
to track-by-track
commentary, follow?

57:14.680 --> 57:16.616
- I love it when you talk dirty.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.216
- Right?

57:18.240 --> 57:21.096
Your stuff tells a story
and the hooks stay lodged.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.576
It's a pretty good
start-off for this guy.

57:23.600 --> 57:27.016
Now right about now
you're wondering

57:27.040 --> 57:29.496
what my piece of the pie
is in all this, right?

57:29.520 --> 57:30.936
- Yeah, yeah yeah, cool.

57:30.960 --> 57:31.960
Yeah I'm listening.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.776
- Come on, tell him!
- Beth.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.576
- Tell him what the
fuck he's been up to!

57:36.600 --> 57:38.976

think you're going, huh?

- Calm down!

the non-matches?

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.696
- Well, that's just it.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.976
Every single time it
scans his fingerprint,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.016
a different name comes up.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
- What?

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.880
- There's someone to see you.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600
- Someone?

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280
- A visitor.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.200
- Yes, but I don't know anybody.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.696
- Don't you?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
- No.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160
- Humor me.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.800
- Ah, how you doin'?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.520
So, you're the Devil.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.936
Look, I appreciate
you taking the time.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.680
Please, I won't take long.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.016
You don't know me.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.160
I'm looking for
Christopher Davidson.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.896
He's not in any trouble
or shit like that.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920
I'm not a cop.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760
Hate the bastards.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.600
But I was told you could help me

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.000
and I could really
use your help.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
- Woof.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
- I'm not here!

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Hey!

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.376
You wanna hear a new riff?

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
- No.
- Why not?

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.040
- I want you to start taking
your medication again.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.880
- What does that got
to do with anything?

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.160
Alright fine, I will.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040
I promise.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.520
I'll start taking them again.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.975
I'll take them from
the Dining Hall,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.816
all the way back
to this here room

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.160
and flush it down that there
toilet just like I have been.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.720
What's wrong with you?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.840
Come on, I wanna feel
sorry for myself okay?

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.960
I'll go back to the
pills when I'm ready.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:54.920
Right now, I just don't feel
like stabilizing my moods.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.319
Rock bottom suits
me at the moment.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.960
Going nowhere is good sometimes.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.319
Is that alright by you?

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.640
- It's just good to see
you smiling again.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.856
- Oh my God, are you
tryin' to make me vomit?

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.960
Hey, don't you wanna
hear my new riff?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:21.439

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.720

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.680
Not even supposed to be in here.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.920
- Ben, would you
like to go next?

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.080
- Oh fuck, someone died in here.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.216
Oh I see, he's like that
character in his story.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.696

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.616
You're stuck for a
story, aren't you?

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.616
This is so uncanny.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.696
Do you know if Beth
was still alive,

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.680
she'd say, "You got , dude."

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.056
Come, let me help you.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.120
I think I might've picked
up a trick or two from you

01:21:04.144 --> 01:21:06.776
along the way about how to
tell a really good story.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.496
Come, here's what
we're going to do.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.400
I'm goin' to start the
story, then you, then me,

01:21:10.424 --> 01:21:11.640
then you and so on and so on.

01:21:11.664 --> 01:21:12.664
Now,

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840
me first or you?

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560
Mr Adams.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.576
- There is a legend.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.216
- Oh my, not just a
story but a legend.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.496
- There is a legend that
says the Devil appears

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.480
only once every 666 years.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.560
That he appears in the form
of a person's greatest fear

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.576
and if that fear is conquered,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.376
then evil itself is
destroyed for all time.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.496
- I like it.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.440
- Just tell the story.
- Alright.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.400
Once every 666 years.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320
Good.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.336
Well here's what I
prepared earlier.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.576
Well not exactly, although
someone did once sit down

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.016
and work out the ages of all the
men and women in the Bible.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.456
Working on a theory of course,
that if you work backwards,

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.080
that would give you
the date of creation.

01:22:11.104 --> 01:22:12.384
- 4,004 BC.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.136
- You do know your Bible.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.656
- In the Garden of Eden.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.696
- Is that where our story
begins then, is it?

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.120
- Look, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

01:22:19.144 --> 01:22:20.584
- You're right, you're not!

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.200
Eden.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.400
So very beautiful.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.520
So very

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.696
green as I recall.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.296
- So teaming with
animals and insects.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.800
- The wolf lying with the lamb.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.760
The spider playing with the fly.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440
- Streams and
waterfalls everywhere.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.760
- Bubbling and
flowing everywhere.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.536
- But only one man...
- The first man.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.880
- Adam, picking berries.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.360
Suddenly behind him,
the sound of hissing.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.856
The berries slipped
through his fingers.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.136
He can barely bring
himself to turn around.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.776
The hissing getting
louder and closer.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.856
- You gotta understand,
the hissing is the Devil

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.120
appearing as Adam's worst fear.

01:23:17.144 --> 01:23:18.096
I'm right, aren't I?

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.896
All he has to do is turn around

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.016
and evil itself is
conquered for all time.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.256
I am right, aren't I?

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.200
But he doesn't turn
around though, does he?

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.896
He comes close though, does he?

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920
Close,

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760
but no cigar.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.456
- Eden wasn't in Cuba, dude.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.856
- What?

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.640
Oh I see, you're tryin'
to change the subject

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:39.024
'cause you know
what happened next.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:42.136
- So, the world had to
wait another 666 years.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.160
- It did.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.376
The place was ancient India.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.656
The year

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.720
was 3,338 BC

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.816
and the Devil appeared
to a man named.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.456
As his greatest fear.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.856
But did not conquer
his fear that he had.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.760
- And in 666 years after that?

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.200
- Ancient Greece.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.736
- The present?
- The year, Mr Adams.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760
The year.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.240
The year was 2,672 BC.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.320
The person,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
her name was Sophia.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.656
He would appear to Sophia
as her greatest fear.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.816
But Sophia did not conquer
her fear that year.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.456
Are you beginning to see
a pattern, Mr Adams?

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.816
- No, but I'm
beginning to wonder

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.216
what happened 666
years after that.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.416
- Well then think pyramids.
- Pyramids?

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.440
- Think harder.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.520
- Scribe.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840
Go nuts.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.680
- Fine, let's make him
a middle-aged scribe.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.960
A middle-aged scribe working
in the middle of the night.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.840
He blows gently on a
page for the ink to dry.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200
The sound of

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.480
hyenas

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.576
can be heard in the night.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.040
But then he spots movement
in the corner of his eye.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.760
He looks up at the shadow
of the candle on the wall

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.656
and right there beside
the candle is a shadow

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.296
of a very large spider.
- Ah, his greatest fear.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.016
All he has to do is
turn around, but no.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.440
The brush slips
through his fingers.

01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:23.256
The ink staining the
immaculately neat

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.640
hieroglyphics on the page.

01:25:25.456 --> 01:25:26.456
- The shadow moves again.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.176
The spider is moving.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.896
- With a trembling hand, he
picks up the bowl of ink.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.400
He starts to turn
around, but never does.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.336
The bowl smashes
across the hard floor.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.736
- Oh does it ever.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.456
He runs into the light
and the spider,

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.816
the spider is no spider at all.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.856
It's the Devil doing
this with his hand.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.136
- I like it, that's clever.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.536
Spider with his hands.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.840
- You like it?
- Next.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.776
- Ancient China, 1340 BC.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.960
- No good.
- You didn't ask who.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.256
- I know who.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.536
- How could you
possibly know who?

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.840
- It's a story, I
can make it up.

01:26:05.864 --> 01:26:06.840
- Wwell everybody
needs no story.

01:26:06.864 --> 01:26:07.864
- Fine.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.896
- Good, you're learning.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.760
- You're teachin' me
how to tell stories?

01:26:12.784 --> 01:26:13.776
- Amos.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.176
- 666 years later?
- That's right.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.616
- Where?

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.280
- The year was 674 BC.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.040
- Yeah, but you
didn't say where.

01:26:24.064 --> 01:26:26.864
- The year was 674 BC

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.736
and Devil came to Amos
as his greatest fear,

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.456
but Amos did not conquer
his fear that year.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.496
- Aah, the Holy Land.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.600
- How could you...

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.416
It doesn't matter.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.816
Do you know I am startin'
to get sick of this story?

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.456
- Look, alright,
alright, alright.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.400
Amos did not conquer
his fear that year.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.096
No one has conquered
666 years after that

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.960
or 666 years after that.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.216
They're wasted opportunities
lost forever.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240
Evil the victor.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.520
But then, somebody came close.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.240
- What?

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.880
- In the year of
our Lord, 1324 AD.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.560
The place was England.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.840
- A man or a woman?

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.560
- A woman.
- What's her problem?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
- It's dark outside.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.120
- That's it?

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.760
- She'd been collecting
wood for the fire.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.760
She closes the door
with her foot.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.816
She wanders over to the table

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.616
to lay out the wood
for the kindling

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.160
when suddenly behind her
the door opens again,

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.816
but she had definitely closed.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.600
- Yes, I think I can see
where this is going.

01:27:45.624 --> 01:27:47.824
- Aah, I bet you can't.
- Of course I can!

01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:50.416
I bet you she goes over
and closes the door

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.376
and doesn't think
anything of it again.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.400
- Close.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.056
She goes over and
closes the door

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.816
and doesn't think
anything of it again.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.536
- Are you trying to be funny?

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.560
- Let me finish.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.136
This time, she places a
bucket up against it.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.896
- Gee, I never would've
thought of that.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:10.896
- A cup rolls across the table
and smashes on the floor.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.256
She quickly makes the
sign of a cross.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.960
The sound of an owl
makes her jump.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.376
She reaches down to
grab a piece of wood

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.800
and looks down to see
that the bucket,

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.720
the bucket has rolled across
the room to her feet.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.360
- What about the door?

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560
- Well you tell me.

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.216
- It's blown open
again, not fully.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.736
Just hitting against
the frame in a breeze.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.456
She knows she has to close it.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.176
If only she can close that door,

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.256
her greatest fear is
conquered for all time.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.536
She's almost there.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.176
- She stumbles and
falls to the ground.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.496
- But then the door's
blown fully open again.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.936
She jumps to her feet,
rushes at the door,

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.696
out the door and into the night.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.336
It's no good, Mr Adams.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.776
- The door slams
shut behind her.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.056
Correction, the Devil slams
the door shut behind her.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.376
- He really gets around
this Devil guy, doesn't he?

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.680
- Are you starting
to lose count?

01:29:04.704 --> 01:29:05.784
- I never lose count.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.016
She ran into the
night 666 years ago.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.216
That means

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.016
666 years later

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.040
is now.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.040
I'm serious.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.520
The dates do add up.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.096
Spooky, isn't it?

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.120
Do the maths.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.776
It's not my fault if
the figures add up.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.200
It all adds up to me,
you, and your greatest...

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.560
Oh my, that must be me.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.680
Now should I be scared?

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.440
What are you waiting for?

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.000
Why didn't you say something?

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.056
So it was Adele.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.016
All along it was Adele.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.816
I thought it was Beth or
perhaps that Jill girl.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.720
I knew there must be a
reason why you were here.

01:30:12.744 --> 01:30:14.736
- Please, I'm not
sure I understand

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.616
what you can or can't do, but
I need you to help Adele.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.856
Alright, do something.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880
I don't know what.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.080
Help me help her.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.040
You've won.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120
- You romantic, you.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.040
Oh my, she did not
even know you existed

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.736
or how you felt or that
you were playing Jesus

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.896
or playing mad.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.176
Much the same.
- Are you gonna help me?

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200
- One.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.336
Why not?

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360
Yes.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.880
Because you're due
for some luck.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.200
Because you, Ben Adams, are
the most unlucky you've been.

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.216
You fall in love and she
gets raped by how many men?

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.680
You decide to play Savior and
the Devil decides to turn up.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.936
What are the chances, really?

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.680
How unlucky can you get?

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.216
Yes I'll help you.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.320
But only because it's
my of sayin' thank you.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.840
I'd given up, you see?

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.200
I was so bored

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640
and then this.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.736
You, Ben Adams, might very well
be the first bit of creation

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760
to ever give me joy.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.680
- Creation.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.760
I believe in evolution.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.216
Help her.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240
- I am.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.160
Which is to say I am already.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.000
I'm helping right now.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Good book?

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.640
I was just making sure
it wasn't the Good Book.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.176
- You mean the Bible?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.240
No, I don't have one.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.576
- 'Course you haven't.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.760
You said you believe in
evolution but more importantly,

01:32:26.784 --> 01:32:28.520
what happened to the
men that raped you?

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.960
- Please.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.720
I don't want to, please?

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.160
- Goodnight.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.520
It's the others isn't it, Adele?

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.480
The ones you watched
and did nothing.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.896
The whole dance floor full of
people clapping and cheering.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.376
I could tell you exactly
how many there were.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.600
153.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.336
153 people who did nothing.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.320
Most of them are probably
sleeping right now, I don't know.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.440
I want to help you, Adele.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.296
Would it help you if every
one of those 153 people

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.960
died this minute?

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.480
- What?

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.560
- Would it help you if
they died right now?

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.976
If they died in their sleep
or behind the wheel of a car

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.056
or up watching late
night television

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.496
or on a dance floor somewhere?

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.176
Yes, even then.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.520
Clapping and cheering on some
dance floor somewhere, Adele.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:55.056
Would that help you Adele,
if they died this minute?

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880
Shh.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:15.960
Adele,

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.360
they're all dead.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.120
Every last one.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.280
153 people just died

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.400
and I'm smiling.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Now you're smiling.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.960
You have such a beautiful smile.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.080
- Where are you going?

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.480
- Where are you going?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320
- To bed.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.080
Get some rest.

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
Get some sleep.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.880
I'll save you a seat at
the breakfast table.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.800
How did you get in here?

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.840
- Through the door.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:22.216
- Which you naturally
didn't close

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:23.896
after yourself when you came in,

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.176
but what you want me to close

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.600
when you leave,
don't you Robbie?

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.520
- Are you in a good mood?

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440
- Happy.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.440
I am happy.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.576
- You know Ben Adams?

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.096
- From way back.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.496
- Well you know Ben Adams,

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.680
why do I have to hang around
Ben Adams and his friends?

01:35:48.704 --> 01:35:49.704
- Listen to me.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.080
Don't you try and tell me
how to run my business.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.256
You stupid half-wit.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.560
You stupid man.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.280
Don't tell me what to do.

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.160
I've waited too long,
I've worked too hard.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.696
Go to bed,

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.720
now!

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.936
I do not wanna see
you in the morning.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.496
Forget about me.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.976
Go to bed and make
Ben your friend.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.376
Do you understand, Robbie?

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.536
- Why?

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.576
I love you, please let
me still be your friend?

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.496
- I said Ben.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.496
- What did I do?

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.496
You're my friend!

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.576
- Robbie, it's really very easy.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.600
If you want to make me
happy, make Ben your friend.

01:36:42.336 --> 01:36:43.496
Even you can do that, Robbie.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.736
- No please, it's not fair.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.376
I was gonna give you a present.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.616
- I don't want it.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.136
- It's a good present.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.616
It's a watch.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.960
You know you look at your hand
and you haven't got a watch.

01:36:52.984 --> 01:36:54.496
It's a new watch.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.256
I haven't used it, I promise.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.456
I got it for my birthday.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.576
My mom gave it to me.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.880
- A watch?
- Yes!

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.120
- Really?

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.536
There you go.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.576
Give it to Ben!

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.280
Lemme guess,

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.616
here to ensure you fill your
daily quota of repents?

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:36.640
- No.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.496
- Well you've got my attention.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.000
- My room's just next door.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.456
- And?

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.560
- I hear everything.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960
- And?

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.856
- I don't like what people
like you do to good people.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.200
You're not a good person.

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.296
- I think I liked you better
when you were a broken record.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.176
- You're not a good person.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.576
- One more time.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.480
- Stop being so mean to him.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600
- Your 15 minutes are up.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.080

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.656

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.720

I beg your pardon.

01:39:12.184 --> 01:39:14.744
We're not here to
admit anybody or me.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.496
We're not patients, we're fine.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.216
- Oh would you like
to take a seat?

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.696
- Cut that patronizing tone

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.136

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.560

- Okay, what can we do for you?

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.840
- We're looking for
Christopher Davidson.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960
- Are you family?

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.760
Does he know you?

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.696
- Do you believe it?

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.976
- You better...

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.320
- It's a standard
question, guys.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.120
Are you a relative?

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.216
It's the crack of dawn, buddy.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.920
It's a little bit early
for visiting hours.

01:39:54.944 --> 01:39:55.920
- Oh no, I understand.

01:39:55.944 --> 01:39:57.696
Of course not.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.456
I'm not family,
we're not family.

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.240
Well no, we're not
related to him.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.960
That's not my name.
- Christopher.

01:40:31.984 --> 01:40:33.656
- I'm Robbie.
- Christopher, please.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.336
- No one wants Mr
Davidson anymore.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.440
- Please.
- Leave him alone!

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:38.784
