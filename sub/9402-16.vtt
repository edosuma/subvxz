<i>This glove once belonged</i>
<i>to Roberto Clemente.</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:04.054
Thought Jamie
might like it.

00:04.193 --> 00:05.275
Are you sure
about this, man?

00:05.370 --> 00:06.403
That glove belongs
on the hand

00:06.455 --> 00:07.621
of someone
who loves the game.

00:07.705 --> 00:09.239
Me, I used to stand
out in right field

00:09.291 --> 00:10.558
and chase butterflies.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.426
What if I told you
there was a college prospect

00:12.494 --> 00:15.262
who threw 98 miles an hour
accurately?

00:15.347 --> 00:17.098
There must be a reason
he doesn't have an Agent.

00:17.182 --> 00:19.133
Well, what if I told you
his name was Kellerman?

00:19.217 --> 00:21.385
As in
Professor Kellerman's son.

00:21.436 --> 00:22.436
Oh, wow.
I love it.

00:22.521 --> 00:23.754
It's to wear
with your gray suit

00:23.805 --> 00:26.089
when you get that reporter job
at the station.

00:26.141 --> 00:27.641
Thank you.

00:27.726 --> 00:29.193
Oh, it's the station.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.195
It's for you.

00:32.981 --> 00:34.565
I think
we should adopt.

00:34.616 --> 00:37.568
I want that so much,
and I want it with you.

00:37.636 --> 00:39.370
But are you sure
we're ready?

00:39.437 --> 00:40.871
Yeah. We're ready.

Do you know how crazy it is

02:57.459 --> 02:58.575
We need to prepare.

I've got a new sport to watch.

04:01.305 --> 04:03.140
I got new lingo to learn

04:12.000 --> 04:14.368
Oh. Well, there is now.

04:14.452 --> 04:15.703

I won't regret you
not being there.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.173
Oh, boo.
Get out of here, you.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.513
No whistles!

04:28.850 --> 04:31.018
Okay, here I come.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.604
Wow.

04:33.671 --> 04:35.839
Millicent Huxtable,
field reporter.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.474
I'd watch you
all day long.

04:37.525 --> 04:39.360
- Stop.
- I'm serious. You look great.

04:39.444 --> 04:40.527
Well, I feel bad.

04:40.612 --> 04:42.363
This job should be yours,
Marvin.

04:42.447 --> 04:43.814
You're great at your job,

04:43.865 --> 04:46.950
and I'm just some silly girl
pretending to be a reporter.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.619
Hey, they liked you
on the audition tape,

04:48.686 --> 04:51.205
and so did I,
and they were right.

04:51.289 --> 04:53.590
And the best part is now we'll be
able to afford a whole muffin --

04:53.658 --> 04:55.209
ooh, maybe even
those green pistachio ones.

04:55.293 --> 04:57.578
I love those, but they're --
so expensive.

04:57.662 --> 05:00.214
Do it for the green
pistachio muffins, Millie.

05:00.298 --> 05:02.399
Are you sure?

05:02.467 --> 05:04.752
I'm sure.
You're gonna do great.

05:04.836 --> 05:06.036
Thank you.

05:06.087 --> 05:08.872
Okay, here I go.

05:24.239 --> 05:25.439
I love you,
Marvin McFadden.

05:42.073 --> 05:44.625
Is that for brushing
or paddling?

05:44.709 --> 05:46.260
Very funny.

05:46.344 --> 05:47.628
It's for Haley.

05:47.712 --> 05:49.412
My mom had it engraved for me
when I was born,

05:49.464 --> 05:52.266
and since she's having a girl,
I thought she'd like it.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.351
You don't want to keep it?

05:54.418 --> 05:57.638
It'll mean a lot to her,
and she deserves it.

05:57.722 --> 06:00.357
Haley's such an incredible --

06:00.424 --> 06:02.726
Damn it!
She will not stop calling me.

06:02.777 --> 06:05.262
She's been stalking me
all morning to hang out,

06:05.313 --> 06:07.197
and I have to go to Brooke's and
help set up for her surprise shower,

06:07.265 --> 06:08.866
and I'm running
out of excuses.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.735
Easy. Tell her you have
to rotate your tires.

06:11.786 --> 06:14.037
No one ever wants to help
with tires.

06:14.105 --> 06:15.405
It's an inferior part
of the car.

06:17.659 --> 06:19.660
Hi, Haley.

06:19.744 --> 06:23.714
Oh, no, sorry. I had my phone
on silent by accident.

06:23.781 --> 06:28.502
Oh, I can't. I have to, uh,
rotate my tires.

06:28.586 --> 06:29.837
No, that's not a euphemism.

06:29.921 --> 06:32.256
Oh, really?

06:32.340 --> 06:34.308
Great. Yay.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.927
See you soon.

06:36.978 --> 06:39.563
Guess what Haley knows how to do
and offered to help me with

06:39.630 --> 06:41.298
right after we watch
"Love Actually"?

06:41.349 --> 06:43.967
Honestly, you haven't
rotated them in a while.

06:45.904 --> 06:47.271
That lying thing's
a tangled web.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.858
I was a great student --

06:50.942 --> 06:52.993
honor roll,
that sort of thing.

06:53.077 --> 06:55.996
And now we're homebodies.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.483
A cup of green tea and a movie
is us in a nutshell.

07:00.535 --> 07:02.586
Organic food.

07:02.653 --> 07:04.705
Love the organic food.

07:04.789 --> 07:07.674
Okay, uh,
that sounds nice.

07:07.759 --> 07:10.493
So, um, do you guys mind

07:10.545 --> 07:13.013
if I ask you what you do
for a living?

07:13.097 --> 07:15.299
Oh, well, actually --

07:15.350 --> 07:16.934
Ow.

07:17.001 --> 07:20.888
Actually, Julian is
a pretty big-time film director.

07:20.955 --> 07:22.940
He used to live
in Hollywood.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.275
And I am
a clothing designer.

07:25.343 --> 07:27.611
Do you know
Clothes Over Bros?

07:27.678 --> 07:30.447
Oh, no, I don't
really follow fashion.

07:30.514 --> 07:32.783
Oh. That's good.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.451
That's good.

07:34.518 --> 07:37.237
Okay, so, um,
what about your parents?

07:37.322 --> 07:40.207
Would there be some supportive
grandparents around?

07:40.291 --> 07:42.292
Define "supportive."

07:42.360 --> 07:45.528
Ow!
Dear. Honey.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.715
Our parents
are wonderful people --

07:48.800 --> 07:51.418
solid, even-keeled.

Brooke Penelope
Davis Baker,

09:21.467 --> 09:23.551
you break that box spring,
you're sleeping on the floor.

09:23.635 --> 09:25.419
Ooh, daddy's mad,

09:25.504 --> 09:27.171
but there isn't
a box spring.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.756
Well, even so,
you get over here

09:28.841 --> 09:31.142
before you mess up and I have
to raise that baby alone.

09:31.209 --> 09:32.760
Oh, yeah?

09:34.429 --> 09:36.514
I gotcha,
you crazy tigger-y thing.

09:36.565 --> 09:38.232
Mm, I like it
when you get me.

09:38.317 --> 09:40.318
I'm happy to be gotten.

09:41.570 --> 09:44.655
Mm. I love you,
you know that?

09:44.723 --> 09:46.741
Nice to know,

09:48.560 --> 09:51.228

09:51.280 --> 09:54.081
Oh, whenever Quinn
gets Haley here.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.065

09:55.117 --> 09:56.834

09:56.902 --> 09:58.369

09:58.420 --> 10:00.905
There's always stress

10:00.956 --> 10:03.291

at telling white lies,

10:03.375 --> 10:04.575

getting undressed?

10:15.137 --> 10:16.921
Yeah. Is that okay?

10:16.972 --> 10:19.724
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'll watch.

10:21.026 --> 10:24.395

the box spring.

10:24.446 --> 10:26.964
There isn't
a box spring.

10:27.032 --> 10:28.900

10:49.054 --> 10:50.004
Hey, hey.

10:50.088 --> 10:51.839
Big day, coach Scott.
Yep.

10:51.924 --> 10:53.958
Your son is very excited
about Little League tryouts

10:54.009 --> 10:56.010
and surprisingly confident.

10:56.094 --> 10:57.645
He should be.
He's a Scott boy.

10:57.729 --> 11:00.014
What about the off-chance
that he doesn't do so well?

11:00.098 --> 11:01.766
You gonna go
all Dan Scott on him?

11:01.817 --> 11:05.152
I'm kidding! I just know
how competitive you are.

11:05.237 --> 11:06.320
I am not
that competitive.

11:07.689 --> 11:08.823
Okay. That's fair.

11:10.025 --> 11:11.642
Here.

11:12.995 --> 11:14.862
There's no whistles
in baseball, Hales.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.981

11:23.422 --> 11:25.039

11:34.933 --> 11:35.967

11:36.018 --> 11:38.135
Actually, I-I do
have an idea,

11:38.186 --> 11:41.555
but I kind of want to run it
by somebody else first.

11:41.623 --> 11:42.640

11:42.691 --> 11:44.892
Of course.

Do you want me to get it?

12:00.876 --> 12:03.861
No, don't!
Don't answer it.

No.

12:19.928 --> 12:21.679
All right,
I'm headed out.

12:21.730 --> 12:24.381
I told Nathan and Clay
I'd help coach Little League.

12:24.433 --> 12:27.568
You're gonna help coach?

12:27.653 --> 12:29.153
Just because
my area of expertise is

12:29.220 --> 12:31.222

today, huh?

14:34.229 --> 14:35.312

14:35.363 --> 14:37.398

All right.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.016
When you're getting
up to bat,

14:39.067 --> 14:41.452
really take your time getting
into the batter's box, right?

14:41.519 --> 14:42.620
And then right before
the first pitch,

14:42.687 --> 14:44.538
make eye contact
with the pitcher.

14:44.623 --> 14:46.207

them out.

Yeah.
Well, this is it.

Sweet.

Well, maybe you
can fix it.

22:42.338 --> 22:43.755
You know, there was a time
when I barely spoke to my dad,

22:43.806 --> 22:44.673
but it's good now.

22:44.757 --> 22:46.224
It's not gonna happen,
dude.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.143
My dad cares
about three things --

22:48.227 --> 22:50.962
books, his dog,
and that boat.

22:51.013 --> 22:52.731
Well, you have to admit,
the dog <i>is</i> pretty cool.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.600
He rides skateboards.

22:55.651 --> 22:56.985
A skateboarding dog?

22:57.053 --> 22:58.803
That's pretty cool.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.406
What about your mom, Ian?
Are you close to her?

23:01.473 --> 23:04.159
Well, I was,
but my mom was a smart woman.

23:04.243 --> 23:06.111
She had the good sense
to divorce my dad and die

23:06.162 --> 23:07.696
before he could make her
anymore miserable.

I'm giving it to you.

just me growing up,

so all my dad's hopes and dreams
were pinned on me.

24:30.896 --> 24:32.580
I might have had
a brother,

24:32.665 --> 24:34.749
but that didn't save either of us
from our dad's failed dreams.

a good time.

30:20.441 --> 30:21.492
I thought we were good
after the wedding.

30:21.576 --> 30:22.576
Apparently
someone goes to prison

30:22.627 --> 30:24.044
and you don't
cut them a break?

30:24.111 --> 30:25.162
Wait. Prison?

30:25.246 --> 30:27.214
Yeah, prison.
Get used to it, everyone.

30:27.281 --> 30:30.450
I went to prison. It's not
that big a deal. It happens.

30:30.502 --> 30:33.119
Victoria, have a Martini
and calm down.

30:33.171 --> 30:35.455
Nobody here is ashamed
about jail time.

30:35.507 --> 30:38.008
I mean, I went to jail,
and I am not ashamed to say it.

30:38.092 --> 30:40.293
Honestly, who hasn't
been to jail?

30:40.345 --> 30:41.678
I remember my visit
very fondly.

30:41.763 --> 30:44.631
Okay, can we all stop
saying "jail"?

30:44.682 --> 30:46.016
Haley?
Yeah.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.301
Let's just be rational
and stop overexaggerating.

30:48.353 --> 30:49.736
Jail is so not
that big of a deal.

30:49.804 --> 30:50.938
Well, you would know.

30:50.989 --> 30:52.639
I mean, you've been
more than any of us.

30:52.690 --> 30:54.608
Okay, wait.
You've <i>all</i> been to jail?

30:54.659 --> 30:55.642
Ooh, no.
I haven't.

30:55.693 --> 30:56.693
She hasn't been.

30:56.778 --> 30:57.778
Yet.

30:57.829 --> 30:59.196
I haven't yet.
Thank you.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.081
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go.
No, it's --

31:01.148 --> 31:03.000
I wanted to make a toast

31:03.117 --> 31:06.820

31:06.871 --> 31:12.092

my son's life,

31:12.159 --> 31:16.329
because if she hadn't
risked hers to save Jamie,

31:16.381 --> 31:20.551

31:58.223 --> 32:00.841
Chloe, wait.

32:00.892 --> 32:02.392
There's something
I need to say to you

32:02.460 --> 32:03.727
before you decide

32:03.811 --> 32:06.063
that we're not the right parents
for your baby,

32:06.147 --> 32:08.098
starting with I'm sorry.

32:08.182 --> 32:12.319
I know I said a bunch of things
to you this morning

32:12.386 --> 32:13.737
that weren't true,

32:13.821 --> 32:16.857
and I left out some things
that maybe I shouldn't have,

32:16.908 --> 32:19.443
like losing my company

32:19.527 --> 32:23.747
and maybe
my mom going to prison.

32:23.815 --> 32:25.699
But I did that
because I was worried

32:25.750 --> 32:27.117
about what you would think
of us.

32:27.201 --> 32:30.621
Brooke,
I'm 19 and pregnant.

32:30.705 --> 32:33.540
I kind of get the whole
passing-judgment thing.

32:33.591 --> 32:35.092
But I'm not 19,

32:35.176 --> 32:37.511
and I know that I should've
been honest with you.

32:37.578 --> 32:40.380
So be honest now.

32:43.301 --> 32:47.587
When I was a teenager,
I was a mess.

32:47.639 --> 32:52.276
♪ Standing on the edge
of nothing ♪

32:52.360 --> 32:54.478
I was popular,

32:54.562 --> 32:59.116
but I had no idea who I was
or what I wanted.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.035
And I started
a clothing line,

33:02.103 --> 33:04.821
and it became more successful
than I could have ever dreamed.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.824
But even at the height
of my success,

33:07.909 --> 33:10.294
I always felt
like something was missing.

33:10.378 --> 33:13.046
♪ I believe I,
I believe I ♪

33:13.114 --> 33:15.666
Love. A family.

33:15.750 --> 33:19.285
And then I met Julian.

33:19.337 --> 33:21.621
And he is
an amazing director,

33:21.673 --> 33:24.124
but he's
an even more amazing man,

33:24.175 --> 33:27.728
and I know that he's gonna be
the most amazing father.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.013
So there was a time

33:30.098 --> 33:33.767
when I didn't know who I was
or who I wanted to be.

33:33.818 --> 33:37.187
But I've known
for a long time now.

33:37.271 --> 33:39.156
I want to be a mom.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.442
And I want to see
Julian be a dad.

33:42.493 --> 33:47.497
And I want our child
to feel loved and protected,

33:47.582 --> 33:50.150

they're struggling,

just all the coaching

35:00.763 --> 35:04.566
To this day, my dad's
come to one game --

35:04.617 --> 35:07.536
one.

35:07.603 --> 35:10.438
And I pitched right here
on campus.

35:12.959 --> 35:15.894
I'm sorry, man.
That's crazy.

35:15.962 --> 35:17.162
It's okay, though,

35:17.246 --> 35:19.915
'cause this is the only place
in the world

35:19.982 --> 35:21.833
that he can't get to me --

35:21.918 --> 35:23.668
right here on this mound.

35:29.458 --> 35:32.794
I guess
he doesn't understand it.

35:32.845 --> 35:35.180

to know a secret?

35:35.264 --> 35:37.432

in that, you know?

35:52.081 --> 35:54.533
Yeah, I do know.
