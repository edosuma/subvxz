WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.174 --> 00:10.720
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:10.886 --> 00:15.015
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
LIVING OR DEAD, IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.773
<i>Maradó! Maradó!</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:17.036
<i>Diego! Diego! Diego!</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:23.501
<i>Maradó! Maradó! Maradó!</i>

01:36.472 --> 01:37.973
<i>Where is my Pelusa?</i>

02:10.381 --> 02:12.591
<i>You're the greatest player in the world.</i>

02:14.718 --> 02:17.137
<i>Maradona is not a machine</i>
<i>of happiness.</i>

02:17.263 --> 02:20.182
<i>-You are where you deserve to be, Pelusa.</i>
<i>-Goal!</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:22.601
<i>I'm scared.</i>

02:25.813 --> 02:28.274
<i>Just die and leave us alone!</i>

02:28.649 --> 02:31.735
<i>-You did something you shouldn't have.</i>
<i>-Argentina!</i>

02:31.777 --> 02:33.279
<i>Are you sure you can handle it?</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:34.780
<i>Were you with another woman?</i>

02:36.657 --> 02:40.870
<i>Diego! Diego! Diego!</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:46.292
<i>Maradona's the only one</i>
<i>who makes decisions about him.</i>

02:46.375 --> 02:47.877
<i>I wish the earth swallowed me up.</i>

02:48.335 --> 02:50.212
<i>We need to win! Fuck, yeah!</i>

02:52.798 --> 02:53.799
<i>You won't lose.</i>

03:48.687 --> 03:51.231
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

03:51.315 --> 03:52.775
PROMISE

04:10.793 --> 04:12.836
Goal!

04:14.880 --> 04:17.925
Well done, kid.
You did great. Where are you from?

04:18.008 --> 04:21.178
From Villa Fiorito.
Far away from here. Across the river.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.013
Do you want to play for Cebollitas?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.807
You know this is serious?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.768
Many people who play
in the first division started here.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.980
You have to train very hard,
be a good teammate

04:31.063 --> 04:32.856
and don't hog the ball.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.859
- I can do all that, sir.
- You can do all that?

04:37.528 --> 04:40.030
Congratulations, you're now in Cebollitas.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.282
- What's your name?
- Gregorio Carrizo.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.577
- Goyo.
- Goyo. You go now with coach Yayo.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.830
Fill out the forms. Okay?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.711
- One question, sir.
- What?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.837
Are you still signing?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.755
I got a friend who plays better than me.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.716
And why didn't he come today?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.218
He doesn't have money for the bus.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.307
Give him this
and tell him to come tomorrow.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.562
- Thank you.
- Make sure you give it to him.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.399
Gregorio Carrizo. Can you sign him up?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.006
- Hi, Pelusa.
- Hi.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.262
- Leave it. I'll carry it.
- Thank you.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.807
Wow, you're a strong boy, Pelu.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.393
Pelusa!

05:52.561 --> 05:53.604
Thank you.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.942
Pelusa, pop into the shop later.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.865
That's it, Pelu! Come on! Yes!

06:05.199 --> 06:07.159
Well done, boy, well done.

06:11.288 --> 06:15.292
Wow. This kid is a genius.
Did you see, Juana, what he can do?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.294
Here. Thank you very much.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.296
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.091
Juana, I'll be right back.
I forgot the meat.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.551
I wasn't impressed.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.096
But your mom was and she's got the money.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.770
Here. For you. Practice.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.699
What are you doing?
Get the hell out.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.245
- I came to help you, sir.
- Get away from here!

06:51.328 --> 06:55.290
Little slum punks like you need
to be kicked out of here.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.340
- You scared me.
- What are you up to?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.554
Pelusa, damn you to hell!

07:40.502 --> 07:42.588
Hey, pass it, come on!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.800
Hey, damn asshole!

07:49.595 --> 07:51.430
Get him, come on!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.633
Pass it on.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.220
Look.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.180
Where did you get this, Pelusa?

08:34.306 --> 08:35.641
Thank you, Pelusa.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.809
Let's start from scratch. Thanks, Pelusa.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.645
- Come on!
- See you later!

08:53.283 --> 08:55.160
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mom!

08:55.244 --> 08:57.579
Bring me a bucket of water, son.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.511
Uma!

09:18.350 --> 09:21.186
- Ma!
- Cut it out.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.438
- Daddy's sleeping.
- My hair. Ma!

09:23.522 --> 09:27.317
Deal with it,
that's because your head looks like a zoo.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.536
Tota.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.674
Look what Hugo did!

09:52.426 --> 09:54.136
What's this mess?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.430
- I'll do it.
- No, you'll get hurt.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.890
- Is Dad in pain again?
- Mm-hmm.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.559
Do you want me to take over?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.980
You're being very sweet.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.691
Hey, sit down.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.198
Why are you being so nice, so helpful?

10:15.490 --> 10:17.451
We weren't born yesterday.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.037
- What are you after?
- You won't let me.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.414
Look at this bill, it's for the trip.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.666
It's my dream. Please, I beg you.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.836
Pelusita, speak slowly, dear,
so we can understand.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.047
Goyo'll play for the Cebollitas.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.050
And the coach sent money
for me to try out.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.887
Please, Mom, I promise to behave.
I won't fight the others.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.973
What do you mean, "the others"?
They're your sisters.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.060
I'll fix the chicken coop fence
and I won't run away from school.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.811
You run away from school?

10:46.229 --> 10:50.025
No. Well, just once.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.240
Please, it's my dream!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.992
Let me try out for the team.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.536
It's up to you, honey.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.219
Goal!

11:28.814 --> 11:30.232
Goal!

11:31.233 --> 11:32.692
What's the kid's name?

11:33.068 --> 11:35.612
- Diego, they call me Pelusa.
- I'm Jorge.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.782
I may not be on the team,
but I'm the number one fan.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.410
Go over there, Russian.
Don't bother, leave us alone.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.832
Tell us the truth, kid,
how old are you, 13, 14?

11:46.915 --> 11:50.168
We've never seen
a nine-year-old play like that.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.712
- You left them all standing.
- But I'm nine!

11:52.879 --> 11:54.673
I'll ask you some questions.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.091
Answer without thinking.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.634
- Okay.
- When were you born?

11:57.843 --> 11:59.719
- 1960.
- What grade are you in?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.346
- Fifth.
- Fifth?

12:01.430 --> 12:04.141
- Where do you go to school?
- State school 79.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.642
What are they teaching you?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.187
Didn't I tell you?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.274
If he likes soccer this much,
he shouldn't bother with school.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.986
Pelusa, if you're really nine,
you're in Cebollitas.

12:16.069 --> 12:16.903
Thank you.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.406
Perfect, bring me your ID card tomorrow.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.657
To see his age.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.909
To see if he is real.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.871
That's for you, dummy.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.041
I'm in!

12:33.795 --> 12:34.713
Bye, Goyo!

What's wrong with you, dirty boy?
Don't you have a shower in the slum?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.061
THE KID SCORES A LOT OF GOALS!
THE LEFT-FOOTED NUMBER TEN

15:36.936 --> 15:38.855
<i>"Cebollitas, champions again.</i>

15:39.022 --> 15:42.859

<i>A star is born, Diego Caradona."</i>

16:14.099 --> 16:18.103
Come, I'll ask you some questions
so that people can get to know you.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.399
I was told that in a few years
you'll be better than Pelé.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.026
I don't think so. Pelé is the king.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.737
Forget about me and talk to the camera.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.533
Thousands of people watch
this show all over the country.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.701
You'll be famous.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.286
The <i>Sábados Circulares</i> team came

16:35.412 --> 16:38.623
all the way to Villa Fiorito
to meet who they say

16:38.707 --> 16:42.127
is the great hope of Argentine soccer.
Your name?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.754
Diego Armando Maradona.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.507
Tell us, Dieguito, what is your dream?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.051
I have two dreams.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.304
My first dream is
to play in the World Cup,

16:53.388 --> 16:56.933
and the second is to be champions
in the quarterfinals

16:57.392 --> 16:59.477
and what follows with Cebollitas.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.774
<i>The</i> Sábados Circulares <i>team</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:08.403

<i>Tell us, Dieguito, what is your dream?</i>

17:14.576 --> 17:16.578
<i>I dream of playing in the World Cup,</i>

17:16.661 --> 17:19.038
<i>and also to be the champions.</i>

17:22.917 --> 17:25.170
What's the matter, are you happy?

17:25.628 --> 17:26.796
I didn't say that.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.133
Then who was that kid talking there?

17:31.009 --> 17:33.595
It was me,
but they took out the Cebollitas part.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.474
Either they get my name wrong
or they change my dream.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.644
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

17:49.235 --> 17:50.987
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

17:51.070 --> 17:52.030
What a boy, huh?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.912
You really beat me, man.

17:58.995 --> 18:03.082
Mr. Francis, if it weren't for you…
Thanks again.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.501
What happened?

18:04.876 --> 18:05.960
Poor thing.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.006
Hey. What's she doing kissing my son
in front of everyone?

18:10.173 --> 18:12.634
You said it, it's your son.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.804
- Yes, he's my son.
- You're jealous of him like a girlfriend.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.765
- Hey, the birthday boy!
- Say thank you.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.975
- Thank you.
- Behave yourself.

18:21.059 --> 18:21.976
What did he do?

18:22.936 --> 18:24.979
There he goes playing the fool.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.564
What's wrong with you?

18:26.648 --> 18:29.150
No! What are you doing, kid?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.277
What's wrong with you, man?

18:31.528 --> 18:34.113
- Are you crazy?
- He was making faces at Gladys.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.241
So what, you'll stab him for that?

18:36.407 --> 18:37.575
Are you stupid?

18:38.284 --> 18:41.079
How would he know?
He doesn't live around here.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.790
See what I told you, Mr. Francis.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.585
In this neighborhood, when they grow up,
they take the wrong road.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.630
Go get the cake.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.217
Come here. Shake his hand.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.344
Easy.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.764
That's it. Hold this.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.641
It's done.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.227
Well done, sir.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.941
That's it, can you wait outside?
See, it was no big deal.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.862
The treatment is working,

19:13.945 --> 19:17.031
but it must be extended
for at least six more months.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.034
Didn't you see his leg?
Let's give him a break.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.828
- I feel sorry for him.
- Sorry?

19:21.995 --> 19:24.414
I felt sorry
when you first brought him here.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.878
I always ask myself the same question,
are you his manager?

19:30.753 --> 19:33.172
You're dedicated non-stop
to this kid.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.507
Well, he needs me.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.467
His parents are very humble.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.971
Have them sign a contract,
a power of attorney, something formal.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.099
They trust me, I trust them.
That's enough.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.100
Sure.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.480
Diego!

19:49.898 --> 19:51.107
Diego, what's going on?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.610
Diego, wake up, what's wrong?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.739
Come here, something's wrong with Diego.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.491
Ferro, come here!

20:02.243 --> 20:05.079
Help me, come quickly!

20:05.413 --> 20:09.000
Yes. Here, slowly. That's it.

20:09.083 --> 20:13.546
Go get the blood pressure monitor up front
while I call a doctor.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.132
You'll be fine, man. You'll be fine.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.635
Hello? Yes. Emergencies?

20:19.177 --> 20:20.595
I need a doctor.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.391
- Hi.
- This way, Doctor.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.560
Thank you for coming. Please, go ahead.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.276
Sir, can you hear me?

20:35.985 --> 20:38.780
I'm sure his blood pressure is up,
because of the parties.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.157
Lots of drinking, lots of food.

20:41.366 --> 20:45.703
You know how many times I told him,
"Diego, slow down a bit, stop eating?"

20:49.832 --> 20:52.001
If you tell him to do something,

20:52.085 --> 20:54.295
he will do exactly the opposite.

20:55.672 --> 20:56.798
He's Maradona.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.925
What did he take besides alcohol?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.136
What do you mean?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.348
He has a very high heart rate

21:05.431 --> 21:08.393
- and his blood pressure is 180/140.
- Diegui.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.812
No, don't touch him, please.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.481
What are you doing?

21:13.564 --> 21:16.901
I'm calling a code red.
We need an ambulance urgently.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.570
No, forget it. Nobody is coming here.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.447
The patient's critical.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.867
Kid, let's see if you understand,
it's Maradona.

21:25.368 --> 21:29.747
You call an ambulance and,
in five minutes, it's packed with press.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.751
Forget it. We'll take him, huh?

21:34.043 --> 21:35.128
Come on.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.465
It's okay, no one has Diego's stamina.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.135
What about the press?

21:45.555 --> 21:48.224
Come on, Diegui. Come on, let's go.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.685
Let's go, buddy.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.979
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.940
Turn around like this.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.443
That's it. Come on. That's it.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.194
- The leg.
- That's it.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.739
- Wait, my hand's stuck.
- It's all right, that's it.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.117
Listen Ferrito,
check the house from top to bottom.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.537
Clean it up. If the police come,
we'll end up in jail again.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.290
- Got it.
- Loosen your face up a little bit.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.625
- Yeah, okay.
- Listen to me.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.336
Tell Claudia,
but don't tell her everything.

22:17.420 --> 22:21.466
Tell her that Diego felt unwell,
that we took him to the hospital.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.176
Take it easy, buddy.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.386
Call me and let me know how it goes.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.417
Can't we go any faster?

22:56.959 --> 23:01.089
If we get pulled over by the police
for speeding, it'll be worse.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.008
Why don't you calm down, kid?

23:04.342 --> 23:06.636
You're passing your nerves
on to the patient.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.263
It's my first day today.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.100
More reason to calm down.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.685
Try to remember your cardiology lessons,

23:14.811 --> 23:18.147
because if Maradona dies on you,
you screw up your whole career.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.863
Shit! I don't believe it!

23:26.072 --> 23:28.991
- What is it?
- The gas tank is empty.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.077
We won't make it to the hospital.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.040
Easy, Diego.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.381
- Hey, come on!
- Hi, how are you?

23:43.464 --> 23:46.425
I'll fill up, and a coffee, please.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.719
Thanks. I'll fill up in the meantime.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.766
- Hurry up, please!
- Yes.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.435
Here we go.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.648
Keep the change, thanks.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.942
- Please, he's dying!
- Yes. Ready!

24:03.025 --> 24:05.611
- Hurry up!
- Let's go, Diego.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.193
Yes, I've got it.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.531
- Let me, I'll take him.
- Yes.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.910
Hi, how are you? My name is Marcos.

24:54.285 --> 24:57.288
I'm the doctor who attended Maradona.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.166
He fainted, Doctor.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.252
Here we are, champ.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.239
<i>Attention everyone.</i>

25:31.697 --> 25:34.200
I just received a call
from Punta del Este.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.456
It seems that Diego Maradona is dead.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.211
Holy shit, it can't be.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.546
I'm going to need a team to go over there.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.175
Capazo, not you. You have three kids
and this might be long.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.635
That's why he wants to go.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.304
He has three kids, he wants to bail out.

25:55.388 --> 25:59.392
Farina, prepare an obituary for Diego.
Have it ready for me.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.812
Graziano, pack your bags, you're going.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.980
- Laura.
- Yes?

26:04.063 --> 26:07.942
Laura, get a selection
of photos of Diego, will you?

26:08.192 --> 26:10.444
- We're going to run a special edition.
- Great.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.116
Back to work.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.162
Nineteen eighty-two.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.957
Nineteen eighty-six.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.627
Argentinos Juniors.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.463
Nineteen ninety. Maradona.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.304
<i>You have to understand</i>
<i>that I'm only 20 years old.</i>

26:36.387 --> 26:39.432
<i>I'm often criticized,</i>
<i>but I am in charge of my life</i>

26:39.515 --> 26:42.184
<i>and my life's what it is,</i>
<i>and I'm famous, I thank God.</i>

26:42.268 --> 26:46.188
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>We were determined to win, and we did it.</i>

26:46.355 --> 26:49.191
<i>Victory is always reassuring</i>

26:49.317 --> 26:50.860
<i>and makes the team feel good.</i>

26:50.943 --> 26:53.821
<i>I have ambition.</i>
<i>I have a very big ambition.</i>

26:53.988 --> 26:56.991
<i>Argentinos Juniors is part of my life.</i>

27:13.341 --> 27:16.052
You can't go on
like that on your own, come on.

27:17.345 --> 27:20.097
Give me the ball, you little shit.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.266
What's wrong with you, black punk?

27:23.934 --> 27:25.311
Suck this.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.944
You know where you'll play, punk?
You'll be the ballboy.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.905
- Don't fuck with me, blondie.
- Get lost.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.573
You touched the kid?

27:38.407 --> 27:41.702
You touched Diego Maradona!
Kiss your hand.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.997
You don't even know
how to use it anyway, asshole.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.042
Relax, Pelusa.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.044
You'll play and score a shitload of goals.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.213
<i>The stadium announces</i>

27:52.338 --> 27:56.509
<i>that Huracán, in Parque de los Patricios,</i>
<i>are tied 0-0 with Racing.</i>

27:56.842 --> 28:00.137
<i>In San Martin,</i>
<i>Chacarita is losing to San Lorenzo</i>

28:00.221 --> 28:03.307
<i>at the end of the first 45 minutes 2 to 1.</i>

28:03.391 --> 28:05.851
<i>This was a stadium announcement.</i>

28:08.270 --> 28:10.564
He has to debut
in first division.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.483
The minors are too small for him.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.695
You're the president, say what you want,
but he's not ready. Trust me.

28:20.074 --> 28:23.160
He's better
than any of these 22 idiots on the pitch.

28:23.244 --> 28:27.540
He's not ready, we'll mess it up.
It's going to mess up his head.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.836
This is not a suggestion, Francis.

28:31.919 --> 28:35.005
The general is demanding
that his man make his debut.

28:35.089 --> 28:39.385
My commitment is not to that man,
but to Diego and Diego's parents.

28:39.969 --> 28:43.973
They trust me to guide his career
and to protect him from everything.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.558
Don't worry about the parents.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.185
Maradona is going to first division,
it's decided.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.229
I'm sorry, Francis.

28:51.939 --> 28:57.736
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé, Diego, Diego!</i>

28:58.237 --> 29:04.034
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé, Diego, Diego!</i>

29:04.785 --> 29:07.329
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé…</i>

29:09.665 --> 29:14.128
Pops, did you hear
the fans cheering for me today?

29:15.671 --> 29:20.134
Of course.
You'd have to be deaf not to hear.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.848
Do you think I'll ever be able
to play for Boca?

29:26.140 --> 29:28.476
Of course. All the clubs will want you.

29:28.559 --> 29:32.480
You'll be able to play wherever you like,
except for River.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.399
Listen, look at me.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.694
If you play for them,
I'll give you up for adoption.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.573
What if River pays me double?

29:42.656 --> 29:45.618
It doesn't matter.
The rich are River fans.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.205
No matter how much they pay you,
you are from Villa Fiorito,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.832
so if you play for River, it's treason.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.543
In Fiorito there are
a bunch of River fans.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.795
They're all poor.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.634
If I ever get to earn
some serious money with soccer,

30:03.928 --> 30:05.596
you won't work anymore.

30:06.055 --> 30:09.308
And we'll find that foreman
who's got you by the balls

30:09.683 --> 30:11.310
and we'll kick his ass.

30:11.393 --> 30:13.521
No need to be resentful, son.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.107
Dad, the military.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.027
Keep your mouth shut, don't get smart

30:20.110 --> 30:22.154
and don't say we're Peronists.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.164
Everybody, out of the vehicle!

30:32.706 --> 30:35.125
Go, go, go!

30:35.876 --> 30:38.003
Come on.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.463
Hurry up.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.511
I want everyone with their ID in hand!

30:45.594 --> 30:48.055
Hurry!

30:48.138 --> 30:51.100
- I said I want to see your ID!
- I don't have it, sir.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.851
Why don't you have your ID?

30:52.977 --> 30:56.146
You can't move around
without identification!

30:56.647 --> 30:59.525
Forgive me, sir,
I left home in a hurry and forgot.

30:59.608 --> 31:03.237
I went to the match
and I'm going back home, to Villa Fiorito,

31:03.320 --> 31:04.446
like everyone else.

31:05.239 --> 31:08.325
So, everyone is going to the slum?

31:08.409 --> 31:12.079
- We're working people, sir.
- You work with your hair like that?

31:12.162 --> 31:14.957
- Corporal, take him, background check.
- No, please.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.209
- Hey! Why you taking him away?
- Diego.

31:17.293 --> 31:20.296
He didn't do anything.
Just because he's poor?

31:21.088 --> 31:23.674
- Is this rude boy your son?
- Yes, sir.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.092
I'm sorry, officer.

31:25.175 --> 31:29.805
I'm a soccer player.
I play in Argentinos Juniors second team.

31:30.097 --> 31:33.267
We're back from a game.
We weren't doing anything.

31:33.684 --> 31:35.060
What do you think, Corporal?

31:35.686 --> 31:39.189
I think he looks like a bum,
a bum and a Peronist.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.610
If you are a player, play!

32:17.478 --> 32:20.564
People came to see you, Maradona.
Five minutes, eh?

32:20.773 --> 32:23.192
I have two more trucks waiting to unload.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.445
Is Pelusa okay?

32:26.695 --> 32:29.865
He's fine.
We wanted to talk about something else.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.326
The president tells me
that you agreed with him

32:32.409 --> 32:34.036
that Diego should make his debut.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.496
Yes, he said something.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.790
And you authorized it?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.751
Diego's dying to play
and he's really determined,

32:40.834 --> 32:44.338
- I can't stop him.
- Yes, but we had a verbal agreement.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.216
- We handle Diego's career, you understand?
- Yes.

32:48.175 --> 32:52.638
- Are you messing with us?
- No, sir. Look, I respect you very much.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.557
We're very grateful
for everything you've done.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.477
But you've made a decision
without consulting us.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.646
We don't have a signed contract,

33:00.854 --> 33:03.107
but we invested a lot of time in Diego.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.067
Diego paid you back with goals.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.612
- He did a lot for Cebollitas.
- Maradona.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.532
Time's up, get back to work.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.411
Excuse me.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.120
Kid, will you replace Giacometti?

34:40.287 --> 34:42.206
I need more action in the middle.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.374
- Come on, move it!
- Go, Diego!

34:44.458 --> 34:46.794
Warm up, come on!

34:54.510 --> 34:56.929
- Buddy, what's wrong?
- Goyito.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.598
Score some fucking goals
as you know how.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.392
- We should go in together.
- I'll get my chance.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.770
Enjoy it, then tell me how it feels.

35:05.187 --> 35:09.107
Diego! Come on, play like you know how to.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.235

<i>and number 16, Diego Armando Maradona,</i>
<i>makes his debut.</i>

35:45.352 --> 35:48.772
<i>A young man</i>
<i>with the innocence of a teenager.</i>

35:48.856 --> 35:52.067
<i>His story is still a child's dream.</i>

35:52.150 --> 35:54.945
<i>And Argentine soccer needs dreams.</i>

35:56.280 --> 35:58.574
Let's meet the young talent,

35:58.657 --> 36:01.410
Diego Armando Maradona.
Where were you born?

36:02.119 --> 36:03.245
In Lanús.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.873
And do you have any idols?

36:06.415 --> 36:08.292
Yes, Bochini.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.586
Tell us, what future do you foresee?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.714
Will you continue in Argentinos Juniors,
move to a bigger club,

36:13.797 --> 36:17.759
- get to the national team?
- Let the kid enjoy his debut.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.845
We can talk about his future later.

36:19.970 --> 36:24.266
First of all, Diego will sign a contract
that meets both the needs of the club

36:24.349 --> 36:25.809
and his personal goals.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.438
- Sorry, who would you be?
- Jorge Cyterszpiller.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.606
Diego's friend.

36:31.732 --> 36:33.191
And his manager.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.112
I could tell you were having a hard time.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.282
You have to learn to speak
for the press, Pelusa.

36:41.158 --> 36:42.993
Here we are, gentlemen.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.456
If you don't, they'll walk all over you.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.583
Imagine Tota's face

36:49.958 --> 36:53.462
when she reads in the newspaper
that you're my agent.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.839
Forget it, that won't come out.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.176
- How are you, Juancito?
- Very well, and you?

36:59.843 --> 37:02.095
- I've got a bet for you.
- Go on.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.848
I'll bet you $10 pesos I can take
more punches than you.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.101
- Ten pesos? Fine.
- Tell me when you want me to stop.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.145
- Ready?
- Come on.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.398
One, two,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.818
three, four,

37:17.194 --> 37:19.321
- five… Shall I go on?
- Go on.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.866
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.285
- Okay, that's enough.
- Are you sure?

37:25.369 --> 37:27.454
- Yes.
- He's got stamina.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.373
Your turn, come on.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.124
Let's go.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.461
What are you doing? You're an animal.

37:34.670 --> 37:38.048
I'm a cripple, you're crazy. No, take it.

37:38.674 --> 37:41.468
Take it, done.

37:41.551 --> 37:44.972
- Next time, I'll bet more.
- Okay. A big mozzarella.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.935
Did you see how cheap it was
to beat the shit out of him?

37:51.603 --> 37:53.897
- You're terrible.
- No.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.859
Now, Rengo.

38:00.237 --> 38:02.280
You should be my manager for real.

38:03.740 --> 38:08.078
- I drink but you get drunk? How come?
- What are you laughing at?

38:08.203 --> 38:09.746
I mean it.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.959
You're kind of a showman, fatty.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.128
Come on.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.130
You're good with numbers.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.549
Do you know the story of Puss In Boots?

38:23.135 --> 38:26.680
When a poor peasant dies,
his children share the inheritance

38:26.763 --> 38:29.474
and there's only a cat left
for the youngest one.

38:29.558 --> 38:32.019
The poor kid thinks
that he'll die of hunger

38:32.144 --> 38:36.023
and even thinks about eating it,
but the cat is very smart.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.359
He puts on his elegant boots

38:39.735 --> 38:43.196
and with his cunning manages
to deceive the whole kingdom saying

38:43.280 --> 38:46.324
that his owner is
an important and very rich marquis.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.953
So he manages to meet the king

38:51.413 --> 38:52.497
and his daughter.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.750
Thanks to his cat,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.128
the peasant's son marries the princess

38:59.254 --> 39:00.964
and becomes a prince.

39:03.425 --> 39:07.179
Okay, but I'd be the cat in cleats.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.722
No, dummy.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.975
In this story, the cat is me.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.394
You have to play

39:15.062 --> 39:17.397
and I work taking care of your interests,

39:17.481 --> 39:19.983
ensuring that they always respect you,

39:20.317 --> 39:22.778
making them believe
that you're at your best moment,

39:22.861 --> 39:24.613
that you are wanted by all the clubs

39:24.696 --> 39:27.199
and that if they don't make an good offer,

39:28.325 --> 39:30.202
we'll refuse it.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.665
- You better make me score a lot of goals.
- Yes.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.876
He runs past one guy.
Maradona is number 10,

39:37.959 --> 39:39.711
and goal!

39:39.836 --> 39:42.506
- Did you see that?
- Goal!

39:49.179 --> 39:53.141
He's Jorge, not just a manager,
but a friend of Maradona.

39:53.225 --> 39:56.478
- Will Diego sign for Argentinos?
- I don't have a crystal ball,

39:57.020 --> 40:00.690
but it's hard to decide
with so many proposals here and abroad.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.318
Excuse me. Thank you very much.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.779
The word here from Jorge Cyterszpiller.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.993
WILL HE STAY OR GO?

40:15.956 --> 40:17.707
<i>Diego, how do you see your future?</i>

40:17.791 --> 40:20.168
<i>Will you stay, do you have other offers?</i>

40:20.377 --> 40:22.587
If the directors make an effort,
Maradona stays.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.340
<i>Argentinos always was</i>
<i>and will be his home.</i>

40:25.507 --> 40:27.676
<i>-Thank you, Diego.</i>
<i>-No, thank you.</i>

40:30.137 --> 40:31.513
MAGIC IN HIS FEET!
Maradona thrashes Boca Juniors

40:35.976 --> 40:37.519
MARADONA - HIS TALENT
AND ABILITY ARE INDISPUTABLE

40:37.602 --> 40:39.771
FROM VILLA FIORITO TO STARDOM

40:40.897 --> 40:42.566
MARADONA
A YOUNGSTER OF THE FIRST DIVISION

40:44.693 --> 40:47.070
DIEGO: FROM THE PARK TO THE FIRST DIVISION
WITH THE BALL STUCK TO HIS FOOT.

40:47.154 --> 40:49.156
Look at them surprised

40:49.239 --> 40:52.325
and say,
"It'd be a great honor, but for now,

40:52.409 --> 40:54.286
I'm thinking about the game on Sunday."

40:54.369 --> 40:56.663
There're rumors
that if you keep like this,

40:56.746 --> 40:58.331
you'll play for the national team.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.542
It'd be an great honor,

41:00.625 --> 41:02.586
but I'm thinking about the game on Sunday.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.130
MARADONA - "I'M TOUCHING HEAVEN
WITH MY HANDS"

41:05.213 --> 41:06.298
GLOBAL FIGURE

41:06.381 --> 41:08.133
DIEGO, a kite's dream

41:08.216 --> 41:10.969
Yes, this is my office number.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.473
No. Diego is out of town.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.350
I'll check his schedule.

41:17.434 --> 41:21.146
Ten days or so. Sure, great. Goodbye.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.816
- And?
- Perfect!

41:25.609 --> 41:26.735
Nice!

41:28.945 --> 41:30.113
Any knishes left?

41:30.197 --> 41:32.115
<i>Maradona is looking for it, look out!</i>

41:32.199 --> 41:36.453
<i>Maradona, goal! Goal for Argentinos!</i>

41:36.536 --> 41:41.750
<i>Experts say that Diego is one of the best</i>
<i>Argentine players of the last ten years.</i>

41:41.833 --> 41:44.044
They fell short, Diego is number one.

41:58.099 --> 42:01.394
Hello, Claudia, this is Ricardo Suárez.

42:01.603 --> 42:04.147
- Hi, Ricardo, happy new year.
- Thank you.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.526
I'm sorry to speak to you
at such a sensitive time,

42:08.610 --> 42:11.029
but we received some very confusing news

42:11.196 --> 42:14.157
and I wanted to know
what happened to Diego.

42:14.241 --> 42:16.785
In Buenos Aires,
there's a lot of buzz about it.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.453
What are you talking about?

42:18.536 --> 42:19.913
Don't listen to me.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.873
It must be fake news.

42:21.957 --> 42:26.086
Ricardo, we've known each other
for so long, don't play dumb with me.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.712
What's going on?

43:20.140 --> 43:23.101
I'll call you later.
Diego's parents just got here.

43:24.978 --> 43:27.314
- What happened?
- Tota, dear.

43:27.564 --> 43:29.065
- Chitoro.
- Guillermo.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.192
- Any change?
- It's serious.

43:32.736 --> 43:34.946
His body is very worn out.

43:35.405 --> 43:36.781
But he'll pull through.

43:36.865 --> 43:38.742
I have tremendous faith.

43:38.825 --> 43:41.328
It doesn't cross my mind
that Diego won't wake up.

43:41.870 --> 43:44.539
- Where is he?
- Over there, go.

44:10.774 --> 44:12.275
Son.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.991
Son.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.953
What did they do to you?

44:25.372 --> 44:27.665
Your father and I barely know about it.

44:27.749 --> 44:31.044
Who put you on that path? Who?

44:32.379 --> 44:36.216
I remember as if it were yesterday,
when you were little

44:38.551 --> 44:41.721
and happy, with the ball on your feet

44:42.722 --> 44:44.849
and your legs in the mud.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.149
You didn't look after him!

44:58.363 --> 45:00.907
Where is my Pelusa, Chitoro?

45:05.787 --> 45:06.704
My baby!

45:09.249 --> 45:10.708
He's asleep, Tota.

45:11.334 --> 45:12.836
The apple of my eye!

45:27.267 --> 45:31.563
When I told him I want some days off
because my son's taking me to the beach,

45:32.063 --> 45:33.815
the guy says,

45:34.399 --> 45:38.153
"There's a lot of work here,
if you leave, don't come back."

45:39.988 --> 45:41.990
What a son of a bitch.

45:44.868 --> 45:47.370
You haven't taken a day off in 20 years.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.124
You can't imagine the look on his face
when I said goodbye.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.750
"I'm leaving, boss.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.169
I'm not coming back."

45:54.836 --> 45:56.546
"And what the hell will you do?"

45:56.629 --> 45:59.048
"You Peronist scumbag."

45:59.424 --> 46:01.426
He didn't say that but he wanted to.

46:01.509 --> 46:04.387
- "My son doesn't want me to work anymore."
- Well said.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.473
"What if they break his leg?"

46:06.556 --> 46:08.558
That jealous son of a bitch.

46:09.017 --> 46:11.186
Are you sure you can handle us all?

46:13.188 --> 46:14.981
Your siblings eat a lot.

46:15.690 --> 46:17.484
Throw those bugs away.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.487
Let what is from here stay here.

46:22.030 --> 46:23.740
Think about nice things.

46:24.032 --> 46:26.159
Look at the sea.

46:41.382 --> 46:44.302
Hugo! Watch what you're doing.

46:44.385 --> 46:47.555
Watch at the cars passing by. Go on, Goyo.

46:47.639 --> 46:50.099
Here, take this.

46:50.183 --> 46:52.602
No. Tell the kids to behave, please.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.646
It's good to live near the club, man.

46:55.730 --> 46:59.901
Yes. When you'll sign,
you have to ask for something around here.

47:00.652 --> 47:04.572
They offered something, but I said no.
The apartment was too small.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.659
Did you get a good deal?

47:08.660 --> 47:12.330
If I had, I wouldn't get the house
as part of the payment.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.375
No, the club is broke.

47:16.584 --> 47:19.504
Besides, if you tell
the military you want to go,

47:19.587 --> 47:20.713
you're dead.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.346
Come on, Russian, you son of a bitch!

47:30.223 --> 47:34.185
Change that crap
and buy a real car, you fathead!

47:34.269 --> 47:36.145
- At last.
- He's here!

47:36.229 --> 47:38.773
Okay, man.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.483
I'm broke, Pelusa.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.486
When you make me a fortune, I'll buy two.

47:44.904 --> 47:45.947
He's complaining!

47:55.373 --> 47:57.875
- Let's go.
- Let's see.

48:07.635 --> 48:11.889
Wow, look at this. So many stairs!

48:15.727 --> 48:17.937
It's a mansion.

48:28.031 --> 48:32.160
So, you don't say anything?
You like it or not?

48:33.661 --> 48:35.580
How many doors do we have, son?

48:35.663 --> 48:37.790
About 200, you'll see, Mom.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.544
But if you want more,
we'll order some more.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.989
Don't start, you'll make me cry.

49:36.933 --> 49:40.353
Slowly, Goyo, you're killing me, man.

49:40.561 --> 49:43.231
- You were late and full of hamburgers.
- I wasn't late.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.484
You're not carrying anything
too heavy, are you? Come on.

49:51.864 --> 49:54.200
Do you want me to start slapping them?

49:54.283 --> 49:57.245
Ma, cut it out.
We look like we came out of the jungle.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.084
Excuse me,

50:04.001 --> 50:06.212
do you know where Lascano Street is?

50:08.172 --> 50:10.258
Yes, this is it.

50:12.427 --> 50:14.595
- This one?
- Yes.

50:15.638 --> 50:17.181
So I live here.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.059
You live here on the sidewalk?

50:20.810 --> 50:24.439
Yes, would you like
to come in for a drink?

50:24.522 --> 50:28.067
No, thank you,
I prefer houses with a roof.

50:28.776 --> 50:32.196
Well, this roof you see here is mine.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.574
Yes, but we need to…

50:40.913 --> 50:42.540
No, it's okay, don't worry.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.334
I know I lost
any chance of winning you over.

50:51.007 --> 50:55.678
If you have a broken appliance
and need to fix it, bring it to my dad.

50:55.762 --> 50:59.432
He takes it apart and then puts it
in a box for about 15 years.

50:59.515 --> 51:03.936
Wow, my dad does exactly the same thing.

51:04.020 --> 51:06.397
He just keeps everything in bags

51:06.481 --> 51:08.733
- instead of boxes.
- Where do you live?

51:10.943 --> 51:12.195
Over there.

51:13.279 --> 51:16.324
Are you a fan of Bicho?

51:16.407 --> 51:19.952
- Argentinos?
- Yes, we are all Bicho's fans around here.

51:21.496 --> 51:24.832
I play first team. Maradona.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.335
I'm sure you know who I am.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.504
No, I really have no idea.

51:30.379 --> 51:32.423
- You don't?
- No.

51:32.799 --> 51:34.425
If you don't know me,

51:35.218 --> 51:37.053
you can't be that big a fan.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.932
Maybe I've been such a fan
since I was a girl,

51:41.015 --> 51:42.433
but you're not famous.

51:43.017 --> 51:44.560
- Oh, yeah?
- What is it?

51:44.894 --> 51:46.729
Well, now, you have help.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.148
- Bye.
- Bye…

51:50.733 --> 51:52.318
whatever your name is.

51:55.822 --> 51:57.448
My name is Claudia.

51:58.074 --> 51:59.575
I'm Diego.

52:00.743 --> 52:02.620
Yeah, I knew that.

52:08.876 --> 52:12.547
- "I'm Diego."
- Shut up, fathead.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.715
You shut up.

52:15.216 --> 52:16.384
She's so beautiful.

52:18.469 --> 52:21.347
In his first two seasons
with Argentinos Juniors,

52:21.430 --> 52:24.517
Diego Armando Maradona was
a star player of his team.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.853
He scored 21 goals and made 21 assists.

52:27.687 --> 52:30.523
There are almost no film archives
from that time,

52:30.606 --> 52:33.818
but those who saw him play claim

52:33.901 --> 52:36.529
that it was
"The best version of Maradona."

52:38.072 --> 52:41.826
Meanwhile, the military dictatorship
in Argentina perpetrated crimes

52:41.909 --> 52:46.122
and disappeared thousands of people
in clandestine concentration camps.

52:47.915 --> 52:53.045
Soccer would become
a smokescreen to cover up the genocide.

52:54.463 --> 52:57.508
<i>My first dream is to play</i>
<i>in the World Cup,</i>

52:57.675 --> 52:59.635
<i>and the second is to become champions.</i>

54:09.455 --> 54:13.751
I live my life with intensity,
I don't have to feel sorry for anything,

54:13.834 --> 54:16.420
or even regret something.
That is important.
