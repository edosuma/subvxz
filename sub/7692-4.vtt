WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:07.475
OKAY, GUYS.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.043
THE NEXT PHASE
OF YOUR TRAINING

00:09.077 --> 00:11.412
IS HANDLING EXTREME CLIMATES.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.581
SO WE'LL FROST CHASE,

00:13.614 --> 00:16.050
BAKE BREE,
AND SUBMERGE ADAM.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.252
THAT'S NOT PART OF THE TRAINING,

00:18.286 --> 00:19.620
I JUST GOT ONE OF
THOSE CARNIVAL DUNK TANKS

00:19.653 --> 00:20.654
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO TRY IT OUT.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.991
OKAY, CHASE,

00:24.024 --> 00:25.993
I'M SETTING YOUR TUBE
ON "ANTARCTIC."

00:26.026 --> 00:28.196
IF IT GETS TO BE TOO MUCH,
JUST GIVE ME A SIGN.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.430
( tube powering up )

00:29.463 --> 00:32.031
HEY,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.535
I WANT TO BE
ABUSED BY WEATHER.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.438
LEO, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE ABUSED,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.408
TRY STANDING OVER HERE
NEXT TO ADAM'S MORNING BREATH.

00:40.441 --> 00:44.378
I DON'T HAVE MORNING BREATH.
IT SMELLS LIKE THAT ALL DAY.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.014
LEO, THESE GUYS ARE
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED

00:47.047 --> 00:48.449
TO HANDLE
THESE KIND OF CLIMATES.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.385
I CAN HANDLE EXTREME COLD.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.189
LEO, YOU GET BRAIN FREEZE
FROM CHEWING MINT GUM.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.058
( cell phone ringtones )

00:58.092 --> 00:59.227
DAVENPORT.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.394
WHAT?!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.330
WELL, THAT'S TERRIBLE!

01:02.363 --> 01:05.099
I MEAN, THAT'S AWESOME,
BUT THAT'S TERRIBLE!

01:05.132 --> 01:06.367
I-I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.768
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE?

01:07.801 --> 01:10.171
I CREATED THE WORLD'S
FASTEST TRAIN,

01:10.204 --> 01:11.772
BUT NOW IT'S SPEEDING
OUT OF CONTROL

01:11.805 --> 01:13.707
FULL OF HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE
NUCLONIUM

01:13.741 --> 01:15.476
TOWARDS DOWNTOWN WELKERVILLE!

01:15.509 --> 01:17.211
WELL, THEN WHAT WAS AWESOME?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.747
IT'S GOING LIKE
400 MILES AN HOUR.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.349
HO HO HO HO!

01:21.382 --> 01:23.684
MY ENTIRE CAREER
IS RIDING

01:23.717 --> 01:26.120
OR PERHAPS CRASHING
ON THIS TRAIN!

01:26.154 --> 01:28.489
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!
MY DESIGN WAS FLAWLESS!

01:28.522 --> 01:31.492
SO FLAWLESS YOU FORGOT
TO INCLUDE AN EMERGENCY BRAKE?

01:31.525 --> 01:35.196
NO. I NEVER COUNTED ON
THE CONDUCTOR DROPPING

01:35.229 --> 01:37.265
HIS PAPAYA SMOOTHIE
ALL OVER THE CONTROLS

01:37.298 --> 01:39.233
AND THEN JUMPING
OFF THE TRAIN.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.403
WELL, IF I WERE TO BUILD
A HIGH-SPEED TRAIN,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.738
THE FIRST THING
I WOULD HAVE PUT IN
WAS A CUP HOLDER.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.208
OH! AND ONE OF
THOSE BUMPER STICKERS
ON THE BACK THAT SAYS,

01:47.241 --> 01:48.809
"I BRAKE FOR COWS."

01:50.711 --> 01:52.346
WHEN STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

01:52.380 --> 01:53.681
THEY ALWAYS BLAME
THE SCIENTIST.

01:53.714 --> 01:57.751
THIS IS HUMAN ERROR.
SCIENTISTS DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.787
( tapping )

01:59.820 --> 02:02.356
CHASE.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.093
NOW I HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THE WHOLE TRAIN STORY AGOHH.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.396
THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

02:09.430 --> 02:10.864
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:10.898 --> 02:13.434
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.736
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:15.769 --> 02:18.105
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:18.138 --> 02:20.674
**

02:22.810 --> 02:23.777
WHOO-HOO!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.349
( all screaming )

02:57.745 --> 02:59.880
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

02:59.913 --> 03:00.881
WHENEVER I INVENT SOMETHING,

03:00.914 --> 03:03.817
I ALWAYS CREATE A BACKUP DEVICE
TO SUPPORT IT.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.420
AS OPPOSED TO JUST
BUILDING IT RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.423
YA KNOW, I THINK
I LIKED YOU BETTER FROZEN.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.827
MY AUXILIARY DECELERATOR
WILL STOP ANYTHING--

03:13.861 --> 03:15.529
OCEAN LINERS,
FREIGHT TRAINS,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.765
TANKS, EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS,
TWELVE-WHEELERS--

03:17.798 --> 03:20.868
DOES IT STOP
UNNECESSARILY LONG
EXPLANATIONS?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.836
APPARENTLY SO.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.739
ONLY PROBLEM IS,

03:25.773 --> 03:27.608
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET IT ON THE TRAIN.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.177
YOU GUYS THINKIN'
WHAT I'M THINKIN'?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.178
OUR FIRST MISSION!

03:31.211 --> 03:32.780
I WANT A PET PIG!

03:34.882 --> 03:37.217
NO. NO, NO, NO.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.553
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
FOR THIS KIND OF MISSION.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.889
IT IS A HIGHLY VOLATILE
SITUATION.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.657
DOWN THE LINE--
FINGERS CROSSED--

03:43.691 --> 03:46.694
THERE WILL BE PLENTY
OF OTHER HORRIBLE DISASTERS.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.598
YEAH, BUT...YOU NEED
TO STOP THIS TRAIN NOW.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.833
AND YOU NEED US
TO HELP YOU DO IT.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.935
YOUR CAREER
DEPENDS ON IT.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.804
PLEASE,
MR. DAVENPORT.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.440
THIS IS WHAT
YOU TRAINED US FOR.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.208
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOTTA
LEAVE THE NEST SOMETIME.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.577
OKAY, GET IN
YOUR CAPSULES, GUYS.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.446
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS--

04:05.479 --> 04:08.916
(choking up) IT'S TIME
TO UPGRADE YOUR MISSION SUITS.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.357
I HOPE YOU ADDRESSED
THE CHAFING PROBLEM.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.925
HMM?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.827
( powering up )

04:21.295 --> 04:22.430
( whoosh )

04:23.464 --> 04:25.032
SWEET!

04:27.835 --> 04:30.003
OOH! I SEE YOU PUT IN
THE SEAT WARMERS.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.507
OOH!

04:33.541 --> 04:35.743
ALL RIGHT...

04:35.776 --> 04:38.712
WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE
THESE EARPIECES TO COMMUNICATE,

04:38.746 --> 04:40.013
AND I'LL MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS

04:40.047 --> 04:41.782
ON THE TRAIN SURVEILLANCE
SYSTEM.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.851
THAT WAY IF YOU
BLOW YOURSELVES UP
IN A FIERY EXPLOSION

04:43.884 --> 04:46.687
I CAN WATCH IT UNFOLD
IN GLORIOUS HD.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.290
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.495
WE GET OUR
AND WE GET TO SAVE LIVES!

04:54.528 --> 04:55.929
SERIOUSLY,
I WANT A PIG!

04:58.666 --> 04:59.800
BREE...

04:59.833 --> 05:01.969

( footsteps approach )

05:12.913 --> 05:14.948
WELL, YOUR FAVORITE

WITH SPORTS?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.757
NO, ME!

05:23.791 --> 05:25.926
I AM DONE REPORTING
ON SINGING DOGS

05:25.959 --> 05:27.928
AND BABIES WHO LOOK
LIKE EX-PRESIDENTS.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.931
THE NETWORK FINALLY GAVE ME
A REAL ASSIGNMENT.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.066
I'M COVERING
A RUNAWAY TRAIN!

05:33.100 --> 05:36.537
NO WAY!
AIN'T THAT A COINKY-DINK?
MR. DAVENPORT--

I HAVE A TRAIN TO CATCH.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.978
ABSOLUTELY.
AND DON'T FORGET,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.415
BE BALANCED AND FAIR,
COLLECT ALL THE FACTS,

05:47.448 --> 05:50.784
AND BLAME THE CONDUCTOR--
HE'S AN IDIOT.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.386
( door closes )

05:52.420 --> 05:54.321
THIS STINKS.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.891
EVERYBODY GETS TO GO
ON AN ADVENTURE BUT ME.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.993
LEO, JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T GO ON THE TRAIN

06:00.027 --> 06:01.895
DOES MEAN WE CAN'T
HAVE FUN HERE.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.899
I'LL POP IN
THE GOOBER THE SPUNKY CABOOSE
DVD FOR YOU.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.935

06:07.968 --> 06:12.005
OKAY, THEN POP IT IN
YOURSELF.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.807
COME ON, GUYS,
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.909

06:29.957 --> 06:33.060
HA! LOOK AT THAT--
I'M TRAVEL-SIZE!

06:37.064 --> 06:39.700
(breathless)
OKAY, ROGER,
HOW DO I LOOK?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.602

I DON'T LIVE THERE.

MR. DAVENPORT,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.006
I'M COMING TO GET LEO.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.723
I MEAN, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
WE CAN SURVIVE THE CRASH.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.324
OH. LEO WON'T.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.026
OH. RIGHT.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.694
NEVER MIND.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.964
I'M SORRY YOU GUYS
HAVE TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.399
I KNOW YOU THINK OF ME
AS YOUR ULTRA-COMPETENT,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.802
UNWAVERING, FEARLESS LEADER.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.872
YEAH, JUST THE OPPOSITE,
NACTUALLY..

11:11.905 --> 11:15.208
CHASE, LOOK,
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.811
YEAH! I MEAN,
BIG D's ON HIS WAY

11:17.845 --> 11:19.412
IN HIS HIGH-SPEED
HELICOPTER.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.750
BUT...WHAT IF WE CAN'T
ATTACH THE DEVICE?

11:22.783 --> 11:25.418
WHAT IF THE SUDDEN STOP
CAUSES THE TRAIN TO TIP?

11:25.452 --> 11:29.389
WHAT IF MR. DAVENPORT
 GETS CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM?!

11:29.422 --> 11:31.191
IN A HELICOPTER?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.026
THERE COULD BE BIRDS.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.797
THAT DRIVE CARS?
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.032
CHASE,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.034
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THIS.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.803
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE--

11:42.836 --> 11:46.206
IF SALLY'S ON A TRAIN
TRAVELING AT A CERTAIN SPEED, X,

11:46.239 --> 11:49.810
SHE'S GONNA REACH THE CURVE
AT A CERTAIN TIME, Y.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.979
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS MULTIPLY X BY Y

11:52.012 --> 11:55.382
TO FIND OUT IF WE HAVE
ENOUGH TRACK LEFT TO STOP.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.684
OKAY...

11:57.717 --> 11:59.987
BUT WHAT IF SALLY IS
SITTING ON ENOUGH NUCLONIUM

12:00.020 --> 12:03.857
TO REDUCE AN ENTIRE CITY
TO A STAIN?

12:03.891 --> 12:08.028
THEN SALLY SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN THE BUS.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.903
I'M TASHA DAVENPORT
REPORTING LIVE

12:15.936 --> 12:18.738
FROM THE DANGER ZONE
JUST OUTSIDE WELKERVILLE

12:18.772 --> 12:21.208
WHERE--WHERE MINUTES FROM NOW
THE--THE-THE TRAIN IS EXPECTED

12:21.241 --> 12:23.443
( train whiTO--TO--UM...

12:23.476 --> 12:26.446
WE--WE--WE--
WE GOT HERE TOO LATE?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.715
WE MISSED IT AGAIN?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.050
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

12:30.083 --> 12:32.219
UM, UM, WELL, UH,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.021
FOR THOSE OF YOU TUNING IN,

12:34.054 --> 12:36.323
IT WAS SILVER AND--AND SHINY

12:36.356 --> 12:39.259
AND--AND--AND--
AND IT LOOKED, UM...

12:40.493 --> 12:42.462
IT LOOKED LIKE...

12:42.495 --> 12:44.064
LIKE THIS.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.967
AND--AND--AND IT WAS
GOING REALLY FAST.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.102
IT WAS JUST--
CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK,

12:49.136 --> 12:51.304
CHOOGA-CHOOGA-CHOOGA-
CHOOGA-CHOOGA--CHOOG--

12:51.338 --> 12:54.307
CHOO! CHOOOO!

12:54.341 --> 12:57.777
UH, AUTHORITIES
ARE DOING ALL THAT THEY CAN

12:57.811 --> 13:00.213
TO STOP THE TRAIN
BEFORE IT...

13:00.247 --> 13:01.548
BOOM!

13:02.883 --> 13:05.085
BOOOOM!!!!

13:12.292 --> 13:13.961
OH, I KNOW!

13:13.994 --> 13:16.864
IN THE MOVIE SPARKMAN
 AND THE TRAIN FROM TOMORROW,

13:16.897 --> 13:20.067
SPARKMAN HOPS
IN FRONT OF THE TRAIN
AND STOPS IT WITH HIS PINKIE.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.102
JUST DO THAT!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.404
LEO, I DON'T HAVE
THAT ABILITY.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.774
WELL, THEN YOU
NEED AN UPGRADE.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.211
GUYS! DAVENPORT'S HERE!

13:31.244 --> 13:34.014
HE'S REALLY HERE!
I TOLD YOU WE'D BE FINE.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.415
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.517
YEAH, JUST
THE OPPOSITE,
ACTUALLY.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.094
OKAY, I'M GONNA DROP
THE DECELERATOR NOW.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.797
MAKE SURE YOU CATCH IT,
IT'S VERY DELICATE.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.433
PRETEND IT'S A BABY.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.467
OKAY!!!

13:54.501 --> 13:58.305
( clanking )

13:58.338 --> 14:01.975
( clanking continues )

14:02.009 --> 14:04.244
PRETEND I CAUGHT IT!

14:04.277 --> 14:07.214
FOR THE RECORD,
WHEN I FILL OUT
THE INCIDENT REPORT,

14:07.247 --> 14:09.049
I'M PUTTING "HUMAN ERROR."

14:09.082 --> 14:11.451
OKAY, THIS JUST WENT
FROM "COMIC BOOK COOL"

14:11.484 --> 14:13.520
TO "REAL LIFE TERRIFYING."

14:13.553 --> 14:16.189
MY NEW MISSION IS TO
GET THE HECK OFF THIS TRAIN!

14:16.223 --> 14:18.591
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ABORT THE MISSION!

14:18.625 --> 14:21.094
NEVER LIKED WELKERVILLE,
ANYWAYS.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.230
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
DROP DOWN THE ROPE LADDER.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.965
EVERYBODY UP--
LEO FIRST.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.967
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME TWICE.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.371
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO HOME
AND HAVE SOME COCOA!

14:32.973 --> 14:35.308
GUYS? COCOA!

14:35.342 --> 14:38.045
WE CAN'T QUIT NOW.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.514
IF WE DO, IT MEANS
WE FAILED OUR FIRST MISSION.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.551
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN
TRAINING OUR WHOLE LIVES
FOR THIS MOMENT NOW.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.119
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.255
COME ON, THIS THING'S
ABOUT TO CRASH.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.623
AND WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.292
BUT THAT JUST IT.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.028
MR. DAVENPORT
MADE US SUPERHUMAN,

14:55.062 --> 14:58.565
BECAUSE WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
WE CAN'T.

14:58.598 --> 15:02.435
YEAH. WE PUT
OURSELVES IN DANGER
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.272
WELL, IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T GOING,

15:05.305 --> 15:06.439
I'M NOT GOING EITHER.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.508
LEO, THIS IS
TOO DANGEROUS FOR YOU.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.011
PLEASE. MY MIDDLE NAME
IS "DANGER."

15:11.044 --> 15:14.414
I IT'S PRONOUNCED "DANGER."

15:14.447 --> 15:16.516
LEO, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.219
BY "WE," I MEAN YOU.
GET UP THE LADDER, NOW!

15:19.252 --> 15:20.187
I'M COMING!

15:26.193 --> 15:28.928
I'M CLIMBING UP THE LADDER
RIGHT NOW! PULL ME UP!

15:32.499 --> 15:34.334
( hits button,
door closes )

15:34.367 --> 15:36.403
LEO, ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.205
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.173
I MAY NOT BE SUPERHUMAN,

15:40.207 --> 15:42.275
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T BE A HERO.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.278
A FIRST-AID KIT?

15:45.312 --> 15:48.181
LEO, WHEN I OPEN THIS THING,
YOU BETTER BE INSIDE!

15:48.215 --> 15:50.183
WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK YOU'RE DOING?!

15:50.217 --> 15:52.986
WE'RE COMPLETING
OUR MISSION.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.323
WHAT? GUYS, NO!

15:58.258 --> 16:02.295
OKAY, WE HAVE
APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES
TO SLOW THIS THING DOWN

16:02.329 --> 16:04.998
BEFORE IT HITS THE TURN
AND FLIES OFF THE TRACKS.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.566
OKAY, LET'S THINK.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.701
OBJECTS IN MOTION
REMAIN IN MOTION

16:08.735 --> 16:10.503
UNLESS AN EXTERNAL FORCE
BLOCKS IT.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.572
SO WHAT COULD
BLOCK OUR PATH?

16:12.605 --> 16:15.642
OH, I GOT IT!
WE CAN PUT THE NUCLONIUM TANKS
IN FRONT OF THE TRAIN!

16:15.675 --> 16:18.978
THEN THE TRAIN
WOULD BLOW UP.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.015
THUS STOPPING IT.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.716
IF ONLY WILE E. COYOTE WAS HERE.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.354
HE'D HAVE A GIANT RUBBER BAND
HE COULD TIE AROUND TWO TREES
TO STOP THIS THING.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.456
WAIT A MINUTE.
LEO, THAT'S IT!

16:29.489 --> 16:32.592
THE REID-BENNETT BRIDGE
IS 19.8 MILES AHEAD.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.494
OUR RAPPELLING ROPES
ARE UNBREAKABLE.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.296
SO IF BREE
TIES THEM ALL TOGETHER--

16:36.329 --> 16:38.365
I COULD USE MY SUPER-SPEED
TO RUN AHEAD

16:38.398 --> 16:39.399
AND WRAP AROUND
THE BRIDGE SUPPORTS!

16:39.432 --> 16:41.268
AND THEN ADAM CAN USE
HIS SUPER-STRENGTH

16:41.301 --> 16:43.203
TO HOLD THE ROPE
AND STOP THE TRAIN.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.571
LET'S TO THIS THING!

16:47.107 --> 16:51.178
DID I MENTION THAT
WILE E. COYOTE DIES
IN EVERY EPISODE?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.580
GET THE BAG.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.492
CAN WE CHALK THAT UP
TO HUMAN ERROR?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.507
OKAY, THE ROPE'S SECURE.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.242
ALSO, LOOK WHAT THE TRAIN
DID TAll: OH!ENNY!

17:23.276 --> 17:26.378
AND All: AAAH!REL!

17:30.383 --> 17:33.019
HEY, GUYS,
WHAT IF THIS DOESN'T WORK?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.355
I MEAN, I KNOW I'M STRONG,
BUT THIS GOES WAY BEYOND

17:35.388 --> 17:37.324
OUR TRAINING SCENARIOS--
WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT?

17:37.357 --> 17:40.160
ADAM, STRENGTH
DOESN'T JUST COME
FROM YOUR MUSCLES.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.129
IT ALSO COMES FROM YOUR MIND.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.132
OKAY, MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
SHOULD TAKE THE ROPE.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.801
THIS IS EVERYTHING
WE'VE PREPARED FOR.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.703
YOU CAN DO THIS!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.605
JUST BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.307
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.644
I BELIEVE IN YOU, TOO.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.047
I JUST SPEND FOUR HOURS
IN A BAG WITHOUT A BATHROOM--

18:01.080 --> 18:03.650
I THINK MY SUPPORT
GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.355
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
TWENTY SECONDS.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.524
( cell phone ringtones )

18:11.558 --> 18:13.126
HELLO?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.362
WHAT?! OH, NO!

18:15.395 --> 18:16.396
WHAT IS IT NOW?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.398
CAITLIN JUST
BROKE UP WITH RODNEY!

18:18.431 --> 18:21.268
BREE, THIS IS SERIOUS!

18:21.301 --> 18:25.305
I KNOW! THEY'VE BEEN DATING
FOR, LIKE, THREE MONTHS!

18:25.338 --> 18:27.607
OH. HEY, CAN I TALK
TO HER FOR A SEC?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.345
THAT WAS
A GOOD ONE.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.349
OKAY, GUYS--
FIVE SECONDS.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.685
FOUR, THREE,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.353
TWO, ONE!

18:40.387 --> 18:44.357
( metaAll: WHOA!!!ing )

18:45.425 --> 18:49.296
GUYS? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

18:49.329 --> 18:52.365
( screaming continues )

18:52.399 --> 18:55.768
( metallic screeching
winds down )

18:55.802 --> 18:57.770
* ( theme plays )

18:59.372 --> 19:01.474
Tasha: LENS CAP!

19:03.410 --> 19:05.612
I'M TASHA DAVENPORT
REPORTING LIVE,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.381
AND I AM STANDING IN FRONT
OF THE RUNAWAY TRAIN,

19:08.415 --> 19:10.583
WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY STOPPED.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.452
IN A TOTALLY UNRELATED STORY,

19:12.485 --> 19:15.388
THE REID-BENNETT BRIDGE
HAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.658
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MORNING COMMUTE
IS GONNA BE A DOOZY!

19:20.760 --> 19:22.862
( electrical crackling )

19:25.298 --> 19:27.234
( all grunting )

19:27.267 --> 19:29.736
WE'RE ALIVE!
YOU GUYS DID IT!

19:29.769 --> 19:32.505
WE COMPLETED
OUR FIRST MISSION!

19:32.539 --> 19:34.207
OW! ROPE BURN!

19:35.608 --> 19:38.745
ANYBODY SEE
THE FIRST-AID KIT?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.414
WELL, WE DID IT.
THAT INCLUDES YOU TOO, LEO.

19:41.448 --> 19:46.553
IF YOU DIDN'T WASTE YOUR LIFE
WATCHING CARTOONS EVERY DAY,
WE MIGHT ALL BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.488
SO, WHAT'S OUR NEXT MISSION?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.458
A RUNAWAY ROCKET
OR A SINKING BATTLESHIP?

19:51.491 --> 19:55.528
HOW ABOUT TRYING TO EXPLAIN
THIS ENTIRE THING TO YOUR MOM?

19:55.562 --> 19:58.798
THAT'S A MISSION
WE'LL NEVER RETURN FROM.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.237
BIG D!

20:04.271 --> 20:06.439
AH. THANK GOODNESS.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.576
THE TRAIN IS OKAY.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.445
AND YOU GUYS,
YOU GUYS ARE OKAY, TOO.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

20:12.479 --> 20:15.181
ALL RIGHT, FIRST ONE
BACK TO THE LAB GETS
A FOOD PELLET SMOOTHIE!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.583
YES!

20:18.451 --> 20:19.719
I'LL CATCH UP!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.421
I HAVEN'T WHIZZED SINCE RENO.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.590
I'D LIKE TO AVOID
ANOTHER DISASTER.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.931
WE HAVE GOT
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
INSIDE THE RUNAWAY TRAIN.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.634
MAYBE WE'LL EVEN MEET
THE PERSON WHO STOPPED IT.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.606
( whistlAAAH!

20:39.639 --> 20:41.674
LEO! UH--

20:41.708 --> 20:43.910
HEY! AM HA--HA--

20:43.943 --> 20:45.612
HI, MOM!

20:45.645 --> 20:47.547
WHEREVER YOUR MOTHER IS
RIGHT NOW,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.682
I AM SURE SHE IS VERY ANGRY,

20:49.716 --> 20:53.219
YET...RELIEVED
THAT YOU ARE OKAY.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.721
I AM HERE WITH--

20:54.754 --> 20:57.457
LEO "DANGER" DOOLEY!

20:57.490 --> 21:00.660
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE A...HERO?

21:00.693 --> 21:03.630
WELL, UH--
TASHA, WAS IT?--

21:03.663 --> 21:07.233
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
EXPLAIN MYSELF AS A HERO...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.470
ACTUALLY, I WOULD.
I AM A HERO.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.506
AND WILL YOU CELEBRATE
YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT

21:13.540 --> 21:15.642
BY SPENDING TWO WEEKS
IN YOUR ROOM

21:15.675 --> 21:18.778
WITHOUT TELEVISION
OR VIDEO GAMES?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.747
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
 ONE WEEK,

21:20.780 --> 21:24.751
OR THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
GOES STRAIGHT TO
LINDA MONTIERES!

21:55.582 --> 21:56.849
YES!
