Gonzalo, women like Camila,

00:23.898 --> 00:26.025
they humiliate you.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.570
Because they know
you're afraid of them.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.240
That's the way
they manipulate you.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.285
When you get to know
what they're really like,

00:35.368 --> 00:37.203
the fear ends.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.416
Are you going to live in fear
your whole life?

00:41.499 --> 00:42.625
Or become a man?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.296
What do I have to do?

00:50.759 --> 00:52.594
You have to get her phone

Don't worry, it'll be OK.

-Blanca, center of the universe!
-I love that, perfect. Great!

You still have a lot to do here.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.464
You have to take the SAT.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.883
You have to go to college.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.054
We have to pick out the dump

03:41.763 --> 03:43.556

03:47.143 --> 03:49.312
I know I took too long
to find you,

03:50.563 --> 03:52.774

for that.

But now I need you to wake up.

He set everything up,
he had his weapon loaded,

13:07.244 --> 13:08.829
enjoys chauvinistic humor,

has a mediocre job, and of
course,

13:11.749 --> 13:13.375
all his tragedies
are the fault of gays,

13:13.459 --> 13:15.878
poor people, and women. Poor
guy.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.379
But if he's a jackass,

13:17.463 --> 13:19.673
then he's hardly the leader,
right?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.800
I don't think he's the leader,
either.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.595
He insisted he was only
following The Wolf's orders.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.972
A messenger of sorts.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.226
He sometimes sent coded messages
he didn't even understand
himself.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.614
Do you know what that means?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.619
That you're a deliberate
accomplice

13:48.702 --> 13:50.704
to the abuse of a minor, buddy.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.332

they'll do to you in prison?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.838
I'm not scared.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.840
You think that,

Your girl isn't innocent.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.701
What did you say?

14:30.536 --> 14:33.080
That your daughter isn't
innocent.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.295
Women mature before men.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.800
When we're boys,
they outgrow us...

14:46.176 --> 14:47.803
and manipulate us.

14:47.886 --> 14:51.807
They laugh at us, they lie to
us.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.144
They make us feel worthless.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.355
My daughter has nothing to do
with your piece-of-shit life.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.942
Your daughter is female.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.613
She may be a child,

15:06.864 --> 15:08.949
but rest assured she's out there
manipulating.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.201
Look, motherfucker!
Mention my daughter again,

15:11.285 --> 15:12.995

hands, you hear me?

15:37.519 --> 15:40.773
I think people have a right
to express themselves, Chief.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.692
If it's against violence,
I don't see the issue.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.070
But I want to remind you
that we're here

15:46.153 --> 15:49.365
to investigate crimes;
not to add fuel to the fire.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.160
The Wolf is still free.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.913
He wasn't the leader.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.084
And the worst part -
it could be more than one
person.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.127
I mean, it takes more
than one person to--

16:02.211 --> 16:04.797
Let me see, we have Blanca
alive.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.423
We have her kidnapper.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.594
We have to keep people calm,
not cause panic.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.847
I have a person
in questioning, waiting.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.935
Why? Because he came to that
drugstore following orders.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.478
Today, Blanca's captor is dead.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.854
Who gave those orders then?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.606
Who the fuck gave
those orders, Jorquera?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.275
Listen to me!
This is not a terrorism case.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.655
Rape, kidnapping, homicide.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.740
All the elements
to close the case.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.202
There are adults here,
manipulating minors

16:35.285 --> 16:38.330
into committing
increasingly worse crimes.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.582
Anyone can start the game,
there's no filter.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.001
Nothing preventing you.
You just click...

16:43.752 --> 16:45.087
Boss.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.465
My own son was playing
The Wolf Game.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.343
Your son?

16:55.013 --> 16:56.557
Actually, he was the one

16:56.640 --> 16:58.892
-that marked Carla's daughter.
-What?

16:58.976 --> 17:02.563
I say this so that you know,
so you understand.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.482
-If a child like Gonzalo--
-Enough!

17:05.566 --> 17:07.401
When did you plan
on telling me this?

17:10.237 --> 17:11.321
I'm telling you now.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.367
You should be taken off the
case.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.120
But she's done everything
by the book.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.289
We were conducting
our investigation

17:20.372 --> 17:21.832
and were threatened
in the worst way,

17:21.915 --> 17:23.167
our families, our children.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.210
You were threatened, not him.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.838
We're talking about
a 15-year-old boy, Jorquera.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.840
What do you want to do?
Blame a boy?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.050
And leave the adults
truly responsible for this

17:32.134 --> 17:33.260
free from any consequences?

17:33.343 --> 17:35.679
Enough, enough,
the decision's been made.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.474
-But we're telling you--
-The decision is made!

17:38.557 --> 17:39.892
Case closed.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.311
Blanca is alive,
and that's what matters,

17:42.394 --> 17:45.063
and we found her.
Well, you guys did.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.983
Close the case.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.161
[door closes]

17:59.244 --> 18:00.537
[monitors beeping]

18:16.345 --> 18:18.555
Sweetie, my love.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.432
What have they done to you?

18:23.101 --> 18:24.728
I'll go let them know.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.275
We'll be out of here
very soon, OK?

18:30.359 --> 18:31.777
The two of us.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.780
I will never
leave you alone again.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.406
I promise.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.292
Your dad was alcoholic
and violent.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.046
Violent with you?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.215
Only with me.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.388
But you know
how to defend yourself.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.014
You could kick his ass.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.476
It doesn't work like that,
Gonza.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.315
Your dad was very strong,
psychologically, and...

19:12.609 --> 19:15.696
And he was always belittling me,
all the time, and...

19:17.239 --> 19:19.533
Basically telling me
that I was worth nothing,

19:19.616 --> 19:22.327
that I was insignificant,
that I was stupid.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.540
It's messed up,
because you end up believing it.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.296
With your father, I felt like
I was underwater, like...

19:33.589 --> 19:35.632
Like I didn't count,
I felt voiceless.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
I never told anyone, because...

19:39.887 --> 19:42.139
They'd obviously say:
"Just leave the bastard."

19:42.222 --> 19:44.641
And I'd feel even dumber
than I already did.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.937
Because I couldn't leave him.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.609
Until one day...

19:54.818 --> 19:57.946
something unexpected happened,
something that saved me.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.619
You were born, Gonza.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.830
For the first year
I was stuck to you,

20:06.914 --> 20:09.207
like an animal, like a lion.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.670
I never left your side,
not for a second.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.339
I was fascinated by you.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.759
And he calmed down, too.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.844
I think seeing me at home all
day

20:20.928 --> 20:22.137
taking care of you,
not going out...

20:22.221 --> 20:23.472
It soothed him.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.477
But then I went back to work,

20:30.145 --> 20:31.939
and he started being angry
again.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.358
And...

20:36.443 --> 20:37.861
one day...

20:38.695 --> 20:42.074
I had to go out and got home
later than I'd said.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.914
I found you in the bedroom,
sort of passed out.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.670
As revenge against me,
he took it out on you.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.755
It was so perverse.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.800
And he had locked you up

20:59.883 --> 21:01.969
with no water or food
for the whole day.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.430
And when I picked you up,

21:05.514 --> 21:08.308
you were so fragile
and dehydrated.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.562
Then I took you to the doctor,
to the hospital.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.191
Running, desperate.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.446
And when they gave you fluids
and stabilized you,

21:21.530 --> 21:24.700
when everything was fine
with you...

21:27.577 --> 21:29.037
I went back to the house.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.916
And all the anger
that had to come out, came out.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.293
Years of anger.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.296
-And you shot him.
-Yes.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.883
I shot your dad, Gonzalo.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.805
I was no longer afraid of him.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.642
I just thought,
I had to protect you.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.561
I felt like an animal.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.855
Capable of eating anything,

21:54.938 --> 21:57.733
of tearing apart whatever I had
for you to be OK.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.112
I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.075
And I ask for your forgiveness,
Gonza.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.787
I apologize for that.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.927
I'm telling you all this

22:26.011 --> 22:28.472
because I need you
to trust me again.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.683
Gonza...

22:35.353 --> 22:37.856
I want to take you to Grandma's
for a while.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.525
-I don't need to go away, Mom.
-Yes.

22:41.818 --> 22:44.362
We're leaving tonight, OK?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.704
OK.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.206
[overlapping chatter]

22:55.373 --> 22:58.794
Dude, did you see
all the media out there?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.964
-Look.
-Manuel!

23:03.048 --> 23:06.134
You can't stay away from us,
Manuel.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.428
What would I do
besides take care of you all?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.847
-Liar.
-[chuckling]

23:10.931 --> 23:12.349
Actually, I'm here to say
goodbye.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.558
-No.
-You're leaving?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.852
Yeah, in a couple of days.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.187
You're abandoning us?

23:17.270 --> 23:18.814
My work here is over.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.150
Blanca has appeared
and she'll be fine.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.569
You guys have always been fine.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.946
I have to go home

23:26.029 --> 23:28.073
before I start speaking
in a Chilean accent.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.575
-[all laughing]
-Stop it.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.704
-Have you seen Blanca yet?
-No, not yet.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.331
-Want to go in with us?
-Sure.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.166
-OK, let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.459
What room was it?

23:39.543 --> 23:42.295
[girl] So we can crash at your
place in Mexico City, right?

23:42.379 --> 23:44.005
[Manuel] Crash? What?
You think I have a place?

23:44.089 --> 23:47.259
-How could you not have a place?
-I don't have a place anywhere!

23:47.342 --> 23:49.761
I have no one in Mexico,
no one loves or misses me...

23:49.845 --> 23:52.305
Very funny,
when are you coming back then?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.397
[dog whimpers]

24:01.481 --> 24:06.528
[Petersen] I found him alone
and scared, just like I found
you.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.787
[Elisa]
You've gone completely insane.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.039
They'll find you,

24:18.790 --> 24:20.667
and put you in jail

24:20.750 --> 24:22.586
with common inmates.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.462
When that happens,

24:25.755 --> 24:27.215
I'll be dead,

24:27.299 --> 24:28.967
and you'll be off
the police force.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.307
Is that the way you want to live
your final days?

24:36.016 --> 24:38.935
-Running away?
-What do you want me to do?

24:39.019 --> 24:42.480
To stay in that shitty
apartment?

24:42.564 --> 24:43.982
No, Elisa.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.776
I'll go out looking for death.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.238
They'll find out I visited you.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.495
They may think I gave you the
tool

24:57.579 --> 24:59.664
to destroy the ankle monitor.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.210
Who helped you?

25:03.710 --> 25:04.836
No one.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.506
-Don't lie to me.
-[coughing]

25:11.426 --> 25:13.470
When I was
at that young man's home,

25:14.346 --> 25:15.764
Emiliano González,

25:16.598 --> 25:18.934
I found your book
among his things.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.061
Was that guy
following your orders?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.191
I'm no Wolf, Elisa.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.278
I'm an old man.

25:31.738 --> 25:32.989
Dying.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.035
This game doesn't end here,
Elisa.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.621
Quite the contrary.
It's just begun.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.709
[pressing buttons]

25:44.793 --> 25:46.419
[ringing tone]

25:47.379 --> 25:49.047
[cell phone vibrates]

25:50.632 --> 25:53.593
Pick up the phone.
[coughs and wheezes]

26:12.988 --> 26:14.364
[Jorquera]
<i>Elisa, come to my office.</i>

26:14.447 --> 26:16.658
You're coming with us
to the press conference,

26:16.741 --> 26:19.619
which will be your last
public appearance.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.246
OK.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.708
After that, you will hand over
your badge and weapon,

26:24.791 --> 26:26.710
because you're suspended
and under investigation.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.837
<i>Don't even think</i>
<i>about disappearing.</i>

26:34.843 --> 26:37.637
[Carla] You think those people
want to hear the truth?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.973
[Olivia] Those people
want to turn the page.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.767
Horror gets old quick.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.854
Then what should we do?

26:45.937 --> 26:47.856
Bury our heads in the sand?

26:49.232 --> 26:50.567
We have no choice.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.944
[Elisa]
There's always a choice, Olivia.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.405
Do you know the panic
we'd cause if we told them

26:55.488 --> 26:57.574
that The Wolf will keep hunting
innocent girls?

26:57.657 --> 26:59.200
But it's the truth.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.415
And not doing it would be
cowardly, that's not our style.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.377
It's easy to be reckless
when you have nothing to lose.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.423
I have to make sure this country
won't burn down after this.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.092
But sometimes it's good
for it to burn.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.594
Please!

27:17.677 --> 27:19.679
When will you learn?

27:19.763 --> 27:23.224
Your vigilante role would've
gone to shit had that girl died.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.060
I'm already out, Olivia.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.270
I'll be investigated internally.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.066
If you don't do this, nobody
will.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.818
[man] Commissioner.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.674
Good morning.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.220
Yesterday, in an operation

28:00.303 --> 28:02.263
by the Chilean Bureau
of Investigation,

28:02.347 --> 28:04.432
Blanca Ibarra was found alive.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.727
She was immediately taken
to the emergency room

28:07.811 --> 28:09.479
at San Sebastián Hospital.

28:09.562 --> 28:13.233
They informed that her condition
is delicate yet stable.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.236
During the operation,
her captor and attacker,

28:16.319 --> 28:20.407
an individual identified
as Emiliano González González,

28:21.408 --> 28:24.494
attempted armed resistance
and died onsite.

28:24.577 --> 28:28.331
We are now able to close
Blanca Ibarra's case,

28:28.415 --> 28:30.917
to close the investigation,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.586
and we want to ensure
the public...

28:36.381 --> 28:39.217
We want everyone to know...

28:41.469 --> 28:43.596
that this isn't over.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.268
Blanca Ibarra's captor

28:48.351 --> 28:52.647
was just a part of a network
that includes many more

28:52.730 --> 28:56.359
who are willing to follow
the orders of a so-called leader

28:56.443 --> 28:58.319
whom they call "The Wolf."

28:59.779 --> 29:01.239
[Olivia continues on TV]
<i>The truth is,</i>

29:01.322 --> 29:03.158
<i>we don't know who might be</i>
<i>behind this.</i>

29:04.409 --> 29:05.660
<i>There are "packs."</i>

29:07.036 --> 29:09.998
<i>Hundreds of soldiers</i>
<i>willing to follow his orders.</i>

29:11.624 --> 29:13.460
<i>We don't know who they are,</i>

29:14.294 --> 29:16.129
<i>nor how many they are,</i>

29:17.839 --> 29:20.216
<i>-nor where they are.</i>
-[girls chanting]

29:20.300 --> 29:22.177

do that to me?

30:24.030 --> 30:25.573

[Jorquera]
Thank you, Commissioner.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.114
I can answer calmly...

31:07.073 --> 31:09.617
Son, Manuel spoke
to Blanca's parents.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.622
And they've agreed for you
to see her.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.709
Really?

31:27.468 --> 31:28.928
I warned you.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.430
You left me no choice.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.265
I didn't have a choice, either.

31:32.348 --> 31:36.311
I want you to know how much
I respect you, Fernández.

31:36.394 --> 31:40.064
I'm very grateful
for your work on this case.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.108
Without you, we never
would've found Blanca.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.818
But you know how it is.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.946
What you just did was suicide.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.284
The truth is I'd rather leave
than be part of a system

31:51.367 --> 31:54.120
so profoundly immoral, Jorquera.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.004
Good luck.

Excuse me.

May I help?

Everyone's furious, so am I.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.623
Olivia, I just want to leave
all this behind.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.250
I won't stay if you're not here.
