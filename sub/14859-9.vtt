What are you doing here?
What do you mean?

16:11.929 --> 16:14.341
He texted, "Bring me breakfast
burritos." I said okay.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.176
Hey, hon.
Your plane just landed? Good.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.059
No,
I'll have someone come get you.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.935
You mind going?
No, no, no. I meant Brad.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.937
Huh?
Max just got his burrito.

Sure thing.

Absolutely.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.523
Sir, you have a...

16:32.825 --> 16:34.987
a little salsa on your face,
you maniac.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.119
You don't have to be a jerk.
Got it.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.497
PENNY: Hey.
Hey.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.748
What are you doing here?

16:43.044 --> 16:45.502
Dropping off sister stuff
for Alex.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.378
Is that a new top?
No.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.755
You know, look what I found
here on the fridge.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.541
Didn't you have go to Greece
on your board?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.130
Yes, I did.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.553
[LAUGHS]

16:55.848 --> 16:57.009
Well, uh...

16:57.308 --> 16:58.924
It's not two first-class tickets
to Greece.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.640
A ticket to a first-grade class
production of Grease 2.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.771
Well, you know,
the universe is eons old

17:05.066 --> 17:07.979
and sometimes
a little hard of hearing,

17:08.277 --> 17:09.983
but I've heard the
Mayview Elementary Gazette

17:10.279 --> 17:11.019
called Cody Libman,
the best cool rider

17:12.073 --> 17:13.404
since Kyle Libman.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.655
Very talented family.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.817
So this is one hot ticket.
Well...

17:17.118 --> 17:18.200
[LAUGHS]

17:18.496 --> 17:19.952
What is that smell?
| don't know.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.488
| don't know
what that smell could be

17:21.790 --> 17:23.202
but I think
it's coming from over here.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.333
It's bringing me over here
to the--

17:25.627 --> 17:27.460
Oh, my God.
Five pounds of mussels?

17:27.755 --> 17:30.042
Didn't you ask for that?
Unbelievable.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.629
Jane, everything on my board
is coming true.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.134
No.
Do you remember when I put

17:35.429 --> 17:36.840
"reconnect with ladies" there?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.675
[-- Vaguely.
Just this morning,

17:38.975 --> 17:40.090
out of the crystal blue skies,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.304
| get a letter
from my great-aunt Donna.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.844
Huh! What did she have to say?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.434
A lot.
It was a long letter

17:47.733 --> 17:49.269
given the fact
that she is dead.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.855
[GASPS]

17:51.153 --> 17:53.736
A ghost.
Yeah.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.819
Okay, I'm sorry, Penny.
I'm sorry.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.199
Ugh.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.859
| appreciate
what you're trying to do,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.277
but you don't have
to fix my life.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.163
I'm doing fine.
| know you are.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.494
| just want you to have
everything you want.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.750
| know, and it's very sweet
that you wanna do all this,

18:08.045 --> 18:09.752
but you're not gonna bring
my aunt back to life,

18:10.047 --> 18:12.254
and you can't make Parker
like me.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.132
Parker?
You got him to ask me out.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.043
No. No, I didn't.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.301
You didn't?
No.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.053
Oh, my God. The board works.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.804
Oh! The board works!
| knew it! I knew it!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.556
Except that
| thought you put him up to it,

18:22.852 --> 18:24.513
so I told him off!
| blew it.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.349
No, no, you can un-blow it.
| can un-blow it.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.138
Shh! Some of us are taking naps.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.059
[240]

18:34.530 --> 18:36.191
Dave, what happened?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.652
Ugh!
| got tagged by a Latin gang.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.862
I'm not sure what it says,
but it can't be good.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.118
How do you know?
The skull and penis.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.782
Ugh. Look, everyone feels bad
about what happened last night.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.576
Yeah, they were so judgy,
except you.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.086
Why were you so nice to Molly?
| know you aren't serious.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.122
You're dating her
because she's hot and I get it.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.836
You should see her naked, it's--
No...

18:56.135 --> 18:57.466
Sorry, sometimes I forget

18:57.762 --> 18:59.378
that you're not
a regular friend.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.466
You and I are always
gonna have a special thing,

19:01.766 --> 19:03.382
and when I see
you have a special thing

19:03.684 --> 19:05.140
with someone else
that's real and lasting,

19:06.187 --> 19:08.144
I'm gonna be a total bitch,
just FYI.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.395
| look forward to that day.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.646
[CHUCKLES]

19:10.941 --> 19:12.352
Oh, man. Another penis.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.394
[240]

19:15.696 --> 19:17.983
Dude, who throws keys that hard?
| do,

19:18.282 --> 19:20.614
after having to drive
Forristal's wife around Chicago

19:20.910 --> 19:22.071
for six hours

19:22.370 --> 19:24.077
so she could finish her book
on tape,

19:24.372 --> 19:25.828
Water for Elephants.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.909
Ugh. Horrible.
| know.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.324
| just started reading it.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.540
Look, Brad--
What, Max? Hm?

19:32.838 --> 19:33.873
Do you have my job now?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.254
Do we both pee in a fountain,

19:35.549 --> 19:37.290
or touch a magic skull
and then swap lives

19:37.593 --> 19:39.254
so you get the nice house
and my hot wife

19:39.553 --> 19:40.759
and I sleep on an air mattress,

19:41.055 --> 19:42.420
and iron my clothes
with a toaster?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.680
Everyone knows that ironing
is bad for your clothes.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.761
Secondly, Forristal kicked me
out of his office.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.677
And that is not an air mattress,

19:48.979 --> 19:50.686
that is a very high-end
pool float.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.016
Wait,
go back to the second one.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.772
Forristal asked me
to be honest with him,

19:54.068 --> 19:55.399
| told him
you were the smartest,

19:55.695 --> 19:56.981
most hardworking guy I knew,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.020
next thing I know,
he kicked me out of his office.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.438
Wait.
He kicked you out for that?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.106
Well, not really for that.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.026
He agreed with me.
He thinks you're awesome.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.537
Oh.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.197
misread a moment.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.581
[CHUCKLING]

20:10.876 --> 20:12.116
You're a great guy, Max.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.960
You too.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.962
Ahh.
Yeah, I'm an idiot.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.302
Dude, you're not an idiot.
No, I am.

Oh.

Sink it. Sink it.

Hurt him. Hurt him.

[CAR HONKING]

20:42.867 --> 20:44.483
Yeah,
that was Phylicia Rashad.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.117
Yeah, it felt like Phylicia
would have done that.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.117
Al right.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.702
So I'll call you.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.787

by my phone.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.918

20:56.213 --> 20:58.671
He totally understood,
and he's so sweet

20:58.966 --> 21:00.206
He said
| was a raven-haired beauty,

21:00.509 --> 21:01.715
and then I said,
"That's so Raven,"

21:02.011 --> 21:03.217
and then he laughed.
Or coughed.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.877
But either way,
| think he likes me.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.673
And the craziest part is
he has a vision board too.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.056
[BOTH GIGGLING]

21:09.351 --> 21:10.807
Okay, okay,
when are you going out again?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.434
Never.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.222
Like I would date a guy
with a vision board.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.855
[240]

21:19.361 --> 21:20.601
Yeah, I know.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.612
You would not date a guy
with a vision board.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.272
Because it wasn't
on your vision board

21:24.575 --> 21:25.690
to date a guy
with a vision board.
