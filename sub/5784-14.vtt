00:56.990 --> 01:01.493
"I willingly boast
of my weakness,

01:01.694 --> 01:04.763
that the power of Chris
may rest upon me,"

01:04.765 --> 01:06.732
the book tells us

01:06.866 --> 01:09.768
in second Corinthians.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.005
Do we hide our hurt
from the Lord?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.940
No.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.509
For how can we hide our true
selves and hope to find

01:17.677 --> 01:21.513
redemption and reparation?
Amen.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.516
Who among us
has not been hurt?

01:24.651 --> 01:27.486
Who has not been mistreated?

01:27.620 --> 01:29.488
But in our darkest hours

01:29.656 --> 01:34.326
we discover strength in Jesus.
Amen. Amen.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.229
Our guest today
reminds us of a past

01:37.363 --> 01:39.731
in which we were mistreated.

01:39.966 --> 01:42.334
And though we may wish
to forget that past,

01:42.469 --> 01:45.471
we're reminded to boast

01:45.605 --> 01:47.539
Boast that in our hardships,

01:47.674 --> 01:50.075
we found strength in our Lord!

01:50.276 --> 01:54.113
Boast that in times of need,
we found friends!

01:54.247 --> 01:57.416
Like our friend,
Mr. Frank Parker.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.451
(applause)

02:03.756 --> 02:06.225
Thank you, Pastor Earle.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.060
Amen. That's right, sir.

02:08.194 --> 02:10.529
It's wonderful
to see old friends.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.401
And the younger faces...
Will you be staying for the
tea afterwards, Miss James?

02:16.403 --> 02:19.505
Certainly.
I do enjoy tea.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.841
Is that so? But how do you
feel about sandwiches?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.843
A wonderful sermon.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.981
Indeed, few things could make
a man feel weak and small

02:29.115 --> 02:30.983
like the fight for abolition.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.952
Ain't he a sight
for sore eyes?

02:34.187 --> 02:36.855
Gramma don't have enough
time left on this earth

02:36.857 --> 02:38.757
for chaste manners.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.260
And when speaking
was no longer enough,

02:41.427 --> 02:44.396
I took action.
That's right. Amen.

02:45.865 --> 02:50.269
I smuggled fugitive slaves.
Amen!
Yes, I broke the law!

02:50.503 --> 02:54.706
A law that went against my
feelings and my sympathies.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.509
A law without humanity.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.546
Now, some of you may wis
to call me a hero.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.581
No.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.783
I am simply a man.

03:05.051 --> 03:08.487
I'm simply a man that did what
he knew was the right thing.
Amen.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.624
It is no more than should be
expected by anyone.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.794
Amen.
(applause)

03:15.929 --> 03:19.598
That's right.
Amen. Alleluia.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.174
Hello.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.421
Miss James. Hello.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.358
(woman screaming)

03:52.699 --> 03:55.634
Is he... is he breathing?

03:58.871 --> 04:01.974
He's dead.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.683
What is it, George?
Sir, how did you...?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.886
We've worked together
a long time, George.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.956
You're needed, sir.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.498
Miss James, what have you?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.604
Murder.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.453
Mr. Parker was stabbed in
the fourth intercostal space.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.089
He died between forty
and sixty minutes ago.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.859
Very precise, Miss James.
Did you determine that
using lividity?

04:54.060 --> 04:57.663
No. I saw him speak
about an hour ago.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.466
Well, you've handled
your first crime scene
exceptionally well.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.902
My hands
are still shaking.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.937
This church has always been
such a peaceful place.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.341
And Mr. Parker seemed like
such a lovely man.
George?

05:09.509 --> 05:11.376
Sir.
I found blood
on this door handle.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.645
We'll need to check it
for fingermarks.
Sir. Will do.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.581
Did anyone see who ma
have come in here?
Sir,

05:16.849 --> 05:19.351
there were several comings
and goings once the
service concluded.

05:19.585 --> 05:22.254
Nobody particularly remembers
Mr. Parker coming back inside.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.524
But sir, there was one
interesting thing.

05:25.758 --> 05:28.427
Apparently among the
congregation there was a woman

05:28.661 --> 05:32.264
wearing a veil that completely
obscured her face.
A widow?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.966
Except that nobody could
attest to her identity, sir.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.369
Apparently she slipped in late,
spoke to nobody,

05:37.603 --> 05:40.872
and afterwards just vanished,
as if into thin air.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.975
I can guarantee you
she went out the door, George.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.979
Sir, either way, I suggest
we keep an eye out for a
mysterious veiled lady.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.289
What do you make of that?
Looks like ivory.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.424
It certainly does.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.302
Pastor Earle...
Alderman Hubbard.
Regrettable circumstances.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.038
Inspector Brackenreid
Very troubling.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.808
I understand the victim was
something of a hero.
Indeed he was.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.745
My parents came to Canada
on the Underground Railroad.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.147
A slave hunter
pursued them to the border

06:22.382 --> 06:24.683
and my mother and father hid
beneath the seats of a wagon.

06:25.017 --> 06:28.754
It takes a fearless sort.
I believe Mr. Parker
was that sort of man.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.858
I came here today to pay
my respects for all those
that he helped to freedom.

06:33.192 --> 06:37.028
This is not your church?
Too far from Parkdale for
my convenience, Inspector.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.197
I'm afraid I can't
shed any light

06:39.432 --> 06:42.567
as to who might have
wanted the man dead.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.437
So, all the doors of
the church were unlocked.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.141
That's usual during a service.
But with all of us outside
at the tea,

06:49.409 --> 06:53.111
any stranger could have come
in the front door unseen.
Thank you.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.581
It's possible, but more likely,
Mr. Parker went inside

06:56.749 --> 06:58.884
with someone from the church.
But Detective,

06:59.051 --> 07:01.953
no member of my congregation
would do this.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.524
I am aware that with the
killing of a white man
in a Negro church,

07:05.725 --> 07:09.027
the search for justice
could run hot.
I'll see to it

07:09.228 --> 07:12.998
that everyone
keeps a level head.
Tom Brackenreid.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.802
Oh, bollocks.
Excuse my profanity.
Alderman Hubbard.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.070
Chief Constable.
Good to see you.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.139
What's the situation, Tom?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.442
The victim is a Mr. Frank
Parker. He was a guest
at the service,

07:23.676 --> 07:25.444
and found dead in the vestry
some time afterward.

07:25.678 --> 07:29.281
Detective Murdoch is leading
the investigation.
Murdoch, eh?

07:29.515 --> 07:32.150
Is there a problem with
the Detective on the case?

07:32.418 --> 07:35.554
We can't have this matter drag
out while Murdoch ponders
every footprint

07:35.822 --> 07:38.890
and flowerbed.
Murdoch is methodical,
but he does get the right man.

07:39.025 --> 07:42.561
Chief Constable,
let me be clear.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.665
The police must show
they can be trusted not
to rush to judgment here

07:46.799 --> 07:49.568
Indeed. But let's be frank.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.604
We have a white man killed
in a coloured church.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.106
The public must know
that they're safe.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.143
I think we understand
each other.

07:58.277 --> 08:01.546
Very good. Gentlemen.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.181
Alderman.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.854
Who does he think he is?
I like him.
Don't be naive.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.956
We answer to the
Board of Control.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.458
He should consider himself lucky
he's climbed as high as he has.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.695
Some men do better than you'd
expect by looking at them.

08:16.863 --> 08:20.398
I want this matter
put to bed, Tom.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.368
Constables!

08:23.569 --> 08:27.539
Collect fingermarks
from all these people.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.508
Let's go!

08:39.986 --> 08:43.188
Come to church on a Sunday and
get mixed up with the police.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.758
I can't believe it, either.
Poor Mr. Parker.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.960
You didn't happen to see
anything, did you, Nate?

08:49.095 --> 08:51.596
What makes you ask that?

08:51.864 --> 08:55.066
I'd gathered a plate
of sandwiches for you--
You did?

08:55.301 --> 08:57.969
But when I was looking for you
in the garden I didn't see you.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.171
That would have been
right around the time
when Mr. Parker was--

09:00.406 --> 09:02.674
Working with the Constabulary
and fancy yourself a copper now,

09:02.808 --> 09:05.176
do you?
You don't like the question?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.747
I'm only teasing, Rebecca.
If you had pigtails

09:08.881 --> 09:10.749
I'd be pulling them right now,

09:11.050 --> 09:13.485
and you wouldn't be much
of a detective if
you didn't know why.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.354
I suppose that's when
Gramma sent me over home

09:16.356 --> 09:18.390
to fetch the cakes.

09:18.624 --> 09:22.160
I'm afraid I'm not much help
with your sleuthing.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.597
But maybe I can make it
up to you tonight

09:25.765 --> 09:28.099
by taking you to a restaurant?
A restaurant?

09:28.234 --> 09:31.436
You really must be sweet on me.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.081
Pastor, what can you tell me
about a veiled woman

09:43.249 --> 09:45.784
who was at church today
Who?

09:46.018 --> 09:49.020
Several people have mentioned
her. A widow, perhaps.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.624
She left before the Constabulary
got here. Do you know her?

09:52.758 --> 09:55.360
I couldn't say who she is.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.330
I believe she left before
the service ended today.

09:58.664 --> 10:02.634
This is a small church,
Pastor. Surely you know
all of your congregants.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.936
I do my best.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.473
But I suppose this particular
lady didn't want to be known.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.142
All right, men, let's get
good, clean marks. Record names,

10:11.377 --> 10:15.480
addresses, age and occupation on
every card while you're at it.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.217
Everything under control, Sir.
Save these cards, Tom.
They'll come in handy,

10:19.385 --> 10:21.453
if not for this case,
then the next.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.455
All we did today
was come to church.

10:23.689 --> 10:27.425
Now we're suspects in crimes
that haven't even happened yet.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.427
Don't be testy, boy.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.263
Take it easy, Jeff.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.333
What happened to your hand?

10:35.501 --> 10:37.502
I cut it the other day
Oh yes?

10:37.703 --> 10:40.572
And what were you getting up to
when that happened?

10:40.740 --> 10:42.841
I was just peeling potatoes,
officer.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.943
What's your
name, sir?

10:45.177 --> 10:49.114
My name is Isaac Lowry
All right, Mr. Lowry.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.116
When you're done
giving your fingermarks

10:51.350 --> 10:53.685
Detective Murdoch over there is
going to have a word with you.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.488
I haven't forgotten how
to conduct an interview, Tom.

10:56.622 --> 10:59.190
Peeling potatoes, eh?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.860
That's right.
Or did the knife slip

11:02.094 --> 11:05.130
when you stabbed that
poor man this morning?

11:05.297 --> 11:08.533
Now, you look.
I have done nothing wrong.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.469
Come in here and
accuse a man for what,

11:11.704 --> 11:15.306
hmm? A bandage?
No one's accusing you, sir.
Keep your temper.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.542
You want to keep on
testing me,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.878
and I will show you my temper.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.882
Just calm down, sir.
If I could just have
a word with Isaac--

11:24.116 --> 11:27.852
No. This man just threatened
an officer. Constable,

11:28.087 --> 11:30.655
take him down to the Station.
Now, just hold on one minute--

11:30.890 --> 11:32.657
I'd very much like
to have a look at that cut.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.093
That's what your interview
at the Station is for.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.195
I said go on.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.031
Evans.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.916
I know Isaac Lowry
very well. He is a good man.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.518
That said, he does have
a cut on his hand.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.754
I'm sure there's
an innocent explanation.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.923
You'll have to trust me
to be the judge of that.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.325
Can I also trust you

12:07.560 --> 12:09.694
not to arrest the first
coloured man you suspect?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.809
As Miss James
determined at the scene

12:25.044 --> 12:27.746
the cause of death was a single
stab wound to the aorta.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.750
The blade was dull and narrow,
causing a wound an inch wide
and five inches deep.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.619
These are the victim'
clothes?

12:36.589 --> 12:41.459
Blood inside the breast pocket.
Yes. It looks like

12:41.794 --> 12:44.929
the killer had blood
on his hands, and took
something out of it.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.999
Likely the same person who got
the bloody fingermark
on the door.

12:58.244 --> 13:02.313
You kept me waiting hours
in here for no reason.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.117
I apologise for the delay.
This is Dr. Julia Ogden.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.654
Ma'am.
I have a fresh bandage. May I?

13:14.894 --> 13:18.663
Mr. Lowry.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.206
Mr. Lowry,

13:28.440 --> 13:32.210
why do you think someone
would want Frank Parker dead?

13:32.444 --> 13:34.946
I wouldn't know about that,
Detective. I didn't kill him.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.449
Someone obviously
wished him harm.

13:38.617 --> 13:42.420
But why? He was a brave
and beloved man.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.657
Well, that's
what they say.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.259
You don't agree,
Mr. Lowry?

13:48.494 --> 13:51.095
There's nothing special about
a man that does the right thing.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.765
That alone does not
make him a saint,

13:53.933 --> 13:57.402
much as he acted like it did.
So you felt

13:57.404 --> 14:00.171
that he took
too much credit.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.106
That's right.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.043
I understand that he...
how shall I put this?

14:05.211 --> 14:07.078
He had quite the way
with the ladies.

14:09.048 --> 14:12.150
That man was a rotten lout.
A harmless flirt,
I was assured.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.819
Don't believe whoever'
telling you that.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.689
It wasn't harmless when he
carried on with my mother.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.824
Is that so?

14:24.663 --> 14:27.732
So Lowry had motive.
Sir.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.402
Mr. Parker seduced his mother.
His father left the family
shortly after that.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.538
But I'm confident

14:33.839 --> 14:36.241
the cut on his hand
wasn't made with the same
knife used in the murder.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.711
How can you know that
Mr. Lowry was cut
with a serrated knife.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.247
The wound is also a day or two
old. It's already healing.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.250
So he used another knife.
We have motive

14:45.451 --> 14:48.519
and opportunity.
Does he have a record?
Well, yes--

14:48.754 --> 14:52.590
Excellent. Charge Lowry.
Good work, everyone.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.962
What have you from Mr.
Parker's hotel room, George?

14:58.197 --> 15:00.265
Sir. The victim appeared
to be living on the cheap.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.067
His room was quite rundown
and his belongings were,

15:03.069 --> 15:05.403
well, sparse.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.007
Today wasn't his first
speaking engagement at a church.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.110
No, sir. He'd been to several
churches over the past months.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.945
He was doing
something of a...

15:14.113 --> 15:16.214
a hero's tour through
Ontario, sir.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.716
There's an address here.
Jarvis Street.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.152
I wondered about that myself.
Wealthy friends, perhaps?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.254
In any case,

15:23.389 --> 15:26.591
this was found
under his mattress.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.127
All bills from
the Bank of Toronto.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.396
Two hundred dollars
to be exact.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.731
That's quite
a substantial amount.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.235
Perhaps this is what
the killer was looking for
in Mr. Parker's pocket.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.938
Good work, George.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.941
That's fine, that's fine.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.009
Darling! The driver's here!

15:45.144 --> 15:47.345
Oh, I'm... I'm not--

15:47.479 --> 15:49.914
Come in, come in.
Oh darling,

15:50.049 --> 15:52.216
let me do your tie.
Ma'am,

15:52.218 --> 15:54.552
I'm not the driver.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.121
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.123
I'm Gloria Thomson.
This is my husband,

15:59.358 --> 16:01.626
Mr. Andrew Thomson.
How can we help you,
Detective?

16:01.860 --> 16:04.228
I'm investigating a murder
that took place this morning

16:04.363 --> 16:06.230
at the Coloured Wesleyan Church.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.434
Oh, my goodness. A murder?
In a church on a Sunday?

16:09.436 --> 16:12.003
I can't imagine.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.974
But then, I don't know much
about those people. What brings
you to us, Detective?

16:16.108 --> 16:18.242
Well, the victim,
a Frank Parker,

16:18.477 --> 16:20.845
had your address amongst
his personal effects.

16:21.046 --> 16:24.482
What's your relationship to him?
Frank Parker...

16:24.484 --> 16:27.085
I don't believe
we knew him.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.655
Did you, darling?
Not at all, I'm sure.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.458
I don't know if you're aware,
Detective, but I'm standing
for Parliament.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.160
He could have been one
of my constituents,
planning on writing

16:36.295 --> 16:38.730
a letter of appeal
or somesuch.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.300
Silly, why do you insist on
doing this yourself? Let me--
Away, woman.

16:42.534 --> 16:46.504
If you never let me do it
myself, how will I learn?

16:46.739 --> 16:50.641
I'm sorry we couldn't be
of more help, Detective.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.714
Pardon me, sir.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.716
I wonder if you could help me?

16:58.884 --> 17:02.253
<i>I spoke with</i>
<i>the Thomsons' gardener.</i>

17:02.554 --> 17:05.556
He says he saw a man matching
Parker's description
call on the home,

17:05.891 --> 17:08.659
but there was no answer
so he went away again.
How did a posh couple

17:08.894 --> 17:11.062
get mixed up in this?
Sir, they might not be

17:11.296 --> 17:14.399
Well, if they're not,
we have nothing.
What about Lowry?

17:14.633 --> 17:17.168
His fingermark doesn't match
the mark on the church door.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.938
Sir, I'm not comfortable
making that arrest.
Neither am I.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.242
Let the man go. I'll handle
the Chief Constable.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.748
Mr. Lowry is no longe
a suspect.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.386
Pastor Earle, you may wish

17:35.521 --> 17:37.688
to protect your parishioners,

17:37.923 --> 17:41.359
but you benefit no one by
keeping information from me.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.695
What do you mean?
Mr. Lowry told me

17:44.897 --> 17:46.731
that he and two of
the others came to you

17:46.865 --> 17:49.033
in advance of
Mr. Parker's visit.

17:49.268 --> 17:52.336
And that they asked you not
to welcome him into this church.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.238
As is their right.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.443
In a murder investigation,
that makes three people

17:58.677 --> 18:01.279
with possible motive.
Oh, I don't believe so

18:01.547 --> 18:05.316
Yes, Mr. Lowry and two other
elderly parishioners
did come to me.

18:05.651 --> 18:09.187
One lady told me that
years ago, Mr. Parker
promised her marriage,

18:09.388 --> 18:12.090
but left her when she found
herself with child.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.892
The other said that her affair
with him ended badly.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.762
The ladies decided to stay away
from the service today.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.431
They may have felt
compelled to confront him.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.134
They're on in years now.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.737
Surely not capable
of sneaking into the church
and overcoming Mr. Parker.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.743
And could one of them have
been this woman with the veil?

18:37.850 --> 18:40.451
Dr. Ogden is on a campaign
to harden my weak stomach.

18:40.686 --> 18:44.055
She brought me to Leroux's
for lunch and she insisted

18:44.256 --> 18:47.725
that I try the escargot
You ate snails?

18:47.926 --> 18:51.295
They're quite fine,
as it turns out.
Is that so?

18:51.430 --> 18:54.198
Will you be
ordering them tonight?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.567
Well... no.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.204
But I will try something
entirely new if you will

19:02.174 --> 19:04.709
I can't resist
a challenge, Miss James.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.812
Then you're in trouble
aren't you?

19:22.928 --> 19:24.896
Table for two,
please.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.931
I'm sorry, we have
nothing available.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.734
We don't mind waiting

19:29.736 --> 19:32.303
Um...

19:32.305 --> 19:34.805
Hmm-hmm...

19:35.040 --> 19:38.943
Unfortunately, we're fully
booked up tonight, sir.

19:41.213 --> 19:44.382
You're going to tell m
and my lovely companion
that you won't seat us

19:44.583 --> 19:47.351
because we are Negroes, sir?
Let's go, Nate.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.854
Or maybe I should make a
reservation for another night?

19:50.155 --> 19:53.191
Now why did you want
to go and do that?
It's not worth a fuss

19:53.392 --> 19:56.527
But they have no righ
to keep us out.
I'm sorry.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.031
I didn't think it would happen.
They let me in before.
Yeah, sure they did.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.066
Accompanied by a white lady.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.037
I didn't know
you smoked.

20:06.271 --> 20:09.173
Sure, I told you. That's
where I was after the service.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.209
You said you went hom
for cakes.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.644
Yeah, yeah. That too.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.347
Except when you came back,
you didn't have any cakes.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.516
You were at the church
the whole time.
Now look,

20:18.750 --> 20:22.153
there's nothing
to that, alright?
Did you tell the constable

20:22.421 --> 20:24.255
who interviewed you the truth
about where you were?
Why would I go

20:24.590 --> 20:27.425
and do something fool like that?
Next thing you know, they're
fitting me for a noose.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.094
You have to talk
to Detective Murdoch.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.297
He's a good man; you can trust
him. Or Constable Crabtree.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.100
Just keep quiet about it,
Rebecca, won't you?

20:38.103 --> 20:41.939
This puts me in a bad position
at my job, Nate.
Your job?

20:42.140 --> 20:44.909
You need to think
about your own people.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.879
Whose side are you on?
Whose side am I on?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.083
My skin is as black
as yours, Nate Desmond.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.885
I know who I am. I don't ever
get a chance to forget it.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.855
I don't need to prove
anything to you,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.791
and I certainly don't socialize
with men who lie to me.

21:21.513 --> 21:25.616
You should have told me right
away that he wasn't present
at the time of the murder.

21:25.784 --> 21:29.120
Were you trying to protect him?
No, I...

21:29.288 --> 21:32.156
I suppose I believed
his explanation

21:32.158 --> 21:34.058
that it wasn't
important.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.961
Where can I find him?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.797
He works at a building job
on Albert Street.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.335
I'm sorry, Detective.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.021
Mr. Desmond?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.957
I need you to come down
to the Station House with me.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.959
Detective Murdoch,

22:09.194 --> 22:11.962
if my foreman sees the
Constabulary take me in

22:12.097 --> 22:14.799
I'll lose my job.
I see.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.636
Answer all of my questions
truthfully, and if you've
done nothing wrong,

22:18.870 --> 22:21.572
I see no reason for you to come
down to the Station House.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.607
What did you have to do

22:23.742 --> 22:25.476
with Frank Parker's murder?

22:27.512 --> 22:30.181
Nothing, I swear it.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.116
Mr. Desmond,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.652
you lied to the Constable
who took your statement,

22:34.786 --> 22:38.556
and to Miss James. Now,

22:38.724 --> 22:40.825
you need to tell me
what you're hiding.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.894
I saw someone
come out of the church.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.896
But I'm sure he didn't do it.

22:46.231 --> 22:49.900
Every witness in this case
wants to tell me who didn't
do it. Now, who did you see?

22:50.035 --> 22:53.204
It was Pastor Earle.

22:55.173 --> 22:58.676
He wouldn't kill a man.
What did you see
Pastor Earle do?

22:58.810 --> 23:01.779
He threw something away.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.382
I didn't see what.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.984
Where?
The church garden.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.954
All right.

23:10.088 --> 23:13.290
Thank you for
your cooperation.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.726
Have a good day.

23:19.598 --> 23:22.266
Holy heart of Mary! Sir!

23:23.602 --> 23:26.604
There's a family
of raccoons in there!

23:26.905 --> 23:30.775
Would you prefer if I searched
that area, George?
Sir, I don't like raccoons.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.778
I don't like their little feet.
I don't trust anything

23:33.912 --> 23:36.380
that has hands for feet

23:36.681 --> 23:40.551
What exactly are we
looking for, anyway?
We'll know once we find it.

23:40.786 --> 23:43.587
Sir, why don't we just ask the
Pastor what he threw out here

23:43.822 --> 23:46.357
and where exactly he threw it?
I'd prefer to know

23:46.591 --> 23:48.926
what the item is before I
question the Pastor, George.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.962
Yes, but sir, he could have
come out and retrieved it since.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.665
That's why it's important
for us to conduct
an exhaustive search.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.134
Sir, why would the Pastor want
to kill Mr. Parker anyway?

23:57.136 --> 24:00.070
I don't know.
That's why we--

24:03.275 --> 24:05.576
Keep looking.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.227
Prosecutor Gordon tells me
you never charged Lowry.

24:23.528 --> 24:26.197
His fingermarks
didn't match the ones
we found at the crime scene.

24:26.531 --> 24:29.166
We didn't have the evidence
to arrest him. We are
pursuing other leads.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.902
What are you playing at, Tom?
You had enough evidence.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.406
I'd like to know
what <i>you're</i> playing at,
Jeff. The man is innocent.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.008
You know it and I know it.
I've already told reporters

24:38.210 --> 24:40.110
we caught the man.
It's in today's paper.

24:44.249 --> 24:47.885
Why would you do that?
The public wants to know

24:48.119 --> 24:49.987
that the Constabulary
is keeping them safe.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.957
They're not safe
if we go around throwing
innocent people in jail.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.326
Innocence or guilt is up
for the courts to decide.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.963
It may not be
the way you do things,

24:59.297 --> 25:02.166
but I don't make an arrest
when I know damn well it's going
to be thrown out of court.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.468
I'm your superior now.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.404
You'll arrest who
I tell you to arrest.

25:10.976 --> 25:13.310
Tosser.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.312
Pardon me.

25:58.623 --> 26:02.760
Thank you.
It's really quite silly.
My husband and I attend

26:02.994 --> 26:05.062
his family's church,
but the Minister there

26:05.196 --> 26:08.432
is rather an old fogey.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.302
I met Pastor Earle while
doing some charity work

26:11.469 --> 26:13.337
with some of the Negro
schoolchildren.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.439
He's easy to talk to,

26:15.640 --> 26:19.243
and I found him a more effective
spiritual advisor.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.779
Are you a religious man
yourself, Detective?

26:22.013 --> 26:25.549
I am.
Then you know that
the value of churchgoin

26:25.717 --> 26:27.551
can vary along with the man
in the pulpit.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.255
But you know, it would be
quite the scandal

26:31.523 --> 26:34.191
among my husband's political
supporters if they ever
found out,

26:34.526 --> 26:38.128
so when I go to hear
Pastor Earle's sermons,
I don't want to be seen.

26:38.396 --> 26:42.566
Mrs. Thomson, how do you
explain your visit to the church
this afternoon?

26:42.801 --> 26:46.170
After you told us about the
terrible murder at the church,

26:46.438 --> 26:50.374
I wanted to offer a donation
for the man's funeral.
Indeed?

26:50.542 --> 26:53.143
Do you not think it
quite a coincidence

26:53.278 --> 26:55.579
that Mr. Parker
had your address?

26:55.780 --> 26:58.549
My husband gave
the best explanation

26:58.551 --> 27:00.985
I can think of.
Mrs. Thomson,

27:01.219 --> 27:03.954
Mr. Parker did not writ
your husband a letter

27:04.189 --> 27:07.725
of a political nature.
He came to your home.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.694
Did he really?

27:10.696 --> 27:12.630
I didn't know that.

27:14.599 --> 27:16.667
You were at the churc
the day of the murder,

27:16.868 --> 27:19.169
and you left before
the Constabulary arrived

27:19.371 --> 27:21.639
I left before the service
ended, Detective.

27:21.873 --> 27:25.309
I didn't know there was a murder
until you came to call.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.277
I promise you.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.284
I'll be needing your
fingermarks, Mrs. Thomson.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.857
<i>Davis just gave me</i>

27:40.191 --> 27:43.794
a right bollocking. He's in a
mad rush to close this case.
Did you find the weapon?

27:44.029 --> 27:47.665
No, but I found the veiled
woman. It's Mrs. Thomson.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.701
Let's arrest her.
Davis will be chuffed.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.871
Her fingermarks don't match
the mark that we found
on the church door.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.206
But her story does
strain credibility.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.542
Why would a white woman
disguise herself

27:58.544 --> 28:00.844
just to hear
a better sermon?

28:01.112 --> 28:04.181
What about the money?
She claims to know
nothing of it.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.585
Yet if anyone connected to
Parker had the means to pay
a blackmailer, it's her.

28:08.587 --> 28:11.288
That's true.
But why?

28:13.258 --> 28:15.259
You know, Murdoch,

28:15.493 --> 28:18.095
maybe she goes to see Pastor
Earle for more than his sermons.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.630
Sir?

28:19.864 --> 28:23.567
Her and the Pastor. Do I have
to spell it out to you?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.136
An affair with a Negro preacher

28:26.371 --> 28:28.505
would certainly bring that
Thomson family down
a peg or two.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.709
If that is true, that would
also give Pastor Earle a reason

28:31.910 --> 28:34.011
to hide the truth.
Parker arrives in town

28:34.279 --> 28:37.915
somehow discovers the Pastor and
the lady are having an affair,
blackmails them,

28:38.116 --> 28:39.917
and they kill him
to keep their secret.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.554
Certainly a more plausible
theory than Mrs. Thomson's
explanation.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.756
Check the Pastor's
fingermarks, Murdoch.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.007
(assailants laughing)

29:10.315 --> 29:13.450
Oy!
(whistling)

29:13.585 --> 29:15.619
(assailants laughing)

29:15.754 --> 29:18.322
Get back against the wall!

29:18.324 --> 29:20.724
Get back!

29:22.694 --> 29:25.229
Lowry is being seen to
at the hospital.
Is it bad?

29:25.497 --> 29:28.265
He was beaten quite severely,
sir, but I'm told he'll
likely recover.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.969
What's all this about then?
That darkie killed
a white man.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.938
Can't have a man like that
walking around free.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.108
It's you two scumbags that
oughta be in jail--and that's
exactly where you're going.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.644
Crabtree. Worsley.
My pleasure.
Sir,

29:40.845 --> 29:43.013
I checked the fingermarks
and you were right.

29:43.248 --> 29:45.649
The marks on the door do
belong to Pastor Earle.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.052
Sirs. I found
what he threw away.

30:00.899 --> 30:04.401
You stabbed a man, Pastor.
Killed him in your own church,

30:04.736 --> 30:07.304
while your congregation was
on the other side of the door.
No, you've got it all wrong.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.174
We have a witness who saw you
throw the murder weapon away.

30:10.441 --> 30:13.710
You were having relations with
her. You and Gloria Thomson.
I was not.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.314
That's why Mr. Parker
was blackmailing you.
No, that's--

30:17.448 --> 30:19.550
You must understand:

30:19.684 --> 30:21.985
Frank Parker was my father.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.354
Your father?

30:28.760 --> 30:31.228
He left us when
we were small.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.263
I hadn't
seen him since.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.633
He heard I was a Pastor
and came looking for me
That's why he'd been

30:36.801 --> 30:38.902
visiting Wesleyan churches
in the area.

30:40.872 --> 30:43.707
I thought he wanted
to make amends for the past.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.977
I was wrong.
Then why was he here?

30:47.145 --> 30:50.881
He was in need.
(door opening)
He wanted money.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.187
Gloria.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.189
Solomon.

30:59.390 --> 31:03.493
I came to see if you were
all right. Are you?

31:13.504 --> 31:16.473
They think we're
having an affair.

31:16.475 --> 31:20.444
An affair?

31:20.446 --> 31:23.247
Far from it.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.483
(sighing)

31:26.618 --> 31:29.686
We are brother and sister.

31:36.694 --> 31:40.264
So, you and Pastor Earle
are brother and sister,

31:40.398 --> 31:42.900
and Frank Parker
was your father.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.270
Do you have the same mother?
Yes,

31:46.404 --> 31:49.907
but she died last year.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.110
She lived in Cincinnati.

31:55.980 --> 31:59.449
I didn't go home
for the funeral.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.618
That's the sort of thing
you don't realise

32:01.853 --> 32:04.321
when you begin lying
about where you come from.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.493
You can't go home
again anymore.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.997
But it was what
my mother wanted.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.234
She always thought I would have
a better life this way.

32:19.203 --> 32:23.206
Does your husband know
No.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.208
I was living as white

32:25.376 --> 32:29.479
when we met.
So you thought
your secret was safe,

32:29.614 --> 32:31.615
until your father
came to town.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.823
All he really cared about
was finding Gloria.

32:40.091 --> 32:43.126
He had heard rumours
she married rich.
He wanted money?

32:43.128 --> 32:45.028
Of course he did.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.532
He had a picture of our family,
with Mama holding Gloria
as a baby.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.567
He said it was proof.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.171
I remember Mama saved
to get that portrait taken.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.239
It was special to her.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.842
That must have
made you angry.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.944
You were at the church
service that morning.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.280
Did you know your brother was
going to kill your father?

33:03.414 --> 33:05.682
No, nothing like that.

33:06.017 --> 33:09.820
No, Solomon and I talked
about how we could convince
our father to leave town.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.823
Or, if he refused, how I would
tell my husband the truth.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.992
We never thought of harming him.

33:16.961 --> 33:20.497
So you gave Frank Parker
the money and hoped that
he would leave you alone?

33:20.832 --> 33:24.167
I would never give that man
a thing after leaving our
mother and us like he did.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.169
Perhaps your brother
gave him the money?

33:28.306 --> 33:31.108
Did you plan to kill him
at church?
No!

33:31.342 --> 33:33.477
What happened?
He was already dead
when I found him.

33:41.719 --> 33:44.221
I took this out
of his pocket,

33:44.223 --> 33:46.590
and I got rid
of the knife.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.592
If it wasn't you,

33:48.826 --> 33:51.528
maybe it was your sister
It wasn't my sister.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.466
Lighten
your load, Solomon.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.935
What is this?

33:59.103 --> 34:00.871
It's your brother's
confession.

34:01.005 --> 34:04.408
No, no, no. He can't have.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.544
I'm afraid we have evidence,
Mrs. Thomson.

34:11.082 --> 34:14.217
He must have
done it for me.

34:18.589 --> 34:22.759
This case will become a matter
of public record soon.

34:22.994 --> 34:26.763
You're saying I have no choice
now but to tell my husband?

34:26.765 --> 34:28.932
That's up to you.

34:35.173 --> 34:37.474
You must be Mrs. Thomson.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.043
If you could,

34:40.178 --> 34:42.045
wouldn't you do the same?

34:42.180 --> 34:44.681
I never wanted to be white.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.584
I didn't want to be white.

34:47.718 --> 34:50.253
I just wanted to be free.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.811
Do you see this?

35:15.046 --> 35:18.915
How could this happen
to Mr. Lowry? It's shameful.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.419
I have a mind to advise him
to sue the Constabulary

35:22.553 --> 35:24.588
and hire the lawyer myself!

35:24.789 --> 35:26.590
That would be a mistake,
Alderman Hubbard.

35:26.824 --> 35:29.626
An innocent man has been
accused and attacked.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.896
And folks will call me a
murderer the rest of my life.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.465
The news report was premature.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.236
A miscommunication. It's
unfortunate, but it happens.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.472
I'd like to apologise
on behalf of the Constabulary.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.975
It's Mr. Lowry that
deserves your apology.

35:48.412 --> 35:51.882
Mr. Lowry. I'm sorry
for what happened to you, sir.

35:54.952 --> 35:57.454
Thank you.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.394
Well, fine.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.164
Let that be an end
to your threats, Alderman.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.636
Chief Constable Davis,

36:12.770 --> 36:14.871
I know my race is despised,

36:15.106 --> 36:18.008
but I've always believed
that, given a fair chance,

36:18.010 --> 36:20.443
that will change.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.180
Was Mr. Lowry given a fair
opportunity at your hands?

36:23.414 --> 36:26.416
He was belligerent to police.
You gave him reason to be,

36:26.584 --> 36:28.552
the moment you laid
your eyes on him.

36:28.786 --> 36:31.154
Do you demand that he be
a better man than you,

36:31.289 --> 36:33.156
simply to earn fair treatment?

36:33.424 --> 36:35.992
Maybe the Chief Constable
was instructed to make
a quick arrest.

36:36.127 --> 36:39.529
Is that so, Chief Constable?

36:39.664 --> 36:42.732
Nothing of the kind.

36:47.271 --> 36:50.006
I know that look.

36:50.241 --> 36:53.543
I still have no idea where
this piece of ivory came from.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.646
It must have broken off
of something.
A small thing.

36:56.914 --> 37:00.250
It could have been dropped there
any time before the murder.
True.

37:00.585 --> 37:04.254
Sir, did you get the impression
at any point during your
interview with the Pastor

37:04.488 --> 37:08.191
that he could be lying?
To protect his sister

37:08.359 --> 37:10.961
His handwriting
on his statement--

37:11.195 --> 37:13.730
it doesn't match the handwriting
on this envelope of money

37:13.898 --> 37:15.966
that was found
in Mr. Parker's room.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.302
And it's doesn't even mention
the blow to Mr. Parker's head.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.405
You think she did it.
Well, if she did,

37:22.540 --> 37:24.441
she's a very good liar.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.877
She's been living
a lie for years.

37:31.182 --> 37:34.417
(Gloria, sobbing): Please
believe me. Please don't go.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.554
We've loved each other all these
years. That won't change.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.923
Please. I know,
I didn't mean to.

37:40.191 --> 37:42.692
It was a mistake. I just--
You betrayed me for the money,
I suppose!

37:42.860 --> 37:46.296
Gloria!
I love you! Please!
Please don't go!

37:46.430 --> 37:49.266
You've told him the truth.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.435
What can we do for you
Detective Murdoch?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.704
Mr. Thomson.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.374
You told me that you ha
never met Frank Parker.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.210
I had no idea of any
of this until just now,

38:00.344 --> 38:02.879
when she came home
with this story.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.515
Did you think nothing
of my reputation,

38:05.783 --> 38:08.051
my future in politics?
But you never expresse
a problem

38:08.252 --> 38:10.620
with Negro people.
Of course I don't
have a problem.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.690
But others do.
Powerful backers. Voters

38:13.891 --> 38:16.559
Well, they'll all
find out about me now.

38:16.894 --> 38:20.230
My brother has been arrested
for murder. The whole affair
will be in the papers.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.466
It might be a blessing.
I can't hide anymore.
A blessing!

38:23.701 --> 38:26.903
We must look at it that way.
We must be courageous.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.406
I suppose it's over then.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.609
Not quite, Mr. Thomson

38:32.843 --> 38:35.845
You see, I believe you knew
of your wife's father

38:36.013 --> 38:38.214
before today.
That's ridiculous.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.887
The money that was pai
to Frank Parker

38:43.889 --> 38:46.823
came from you.

38:48.793 --> 38:51.361
This envelope with
Mr. Parker's name on it

38:51.495 --> 38:55.231
is in your handwriting.

38:57.635 --> 39:00.337
He came
to this house

39:00.471 --> 39:03.006
and he asked you
for money.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.875
You knew the truth
and you didn't say anything?

39:06.110 --> 39:07.877
You're not the only on
who can keep a secret.

39:08.112 --> 39:10.313
You planned to meet him
at the church that morning.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.849
I did nothing of the kind.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.754
This was found at the scene
of the murder.

39:21.158 --> 39:24.227
But it looks
remarkably like...

39:24.229 --> 39:28.231
Yes.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.267
Like this.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.427
You killed my father?

40:00.231 --> 40:04.033
I gave him
the money he wanted,

40:04.268 --> 40:07.437
but I couldn't trust him
to keep his mouth shut.

40:07.638 --> 40:11.808
He found the truth
to be too delightful.

40:11.942 --> 40:14.444
That I could be
trapped in this...

40:14.578 --> 40:17.514
this hoax of a marriage

40:17.748 --> 40:21.351
So you hit him over the head
and stabbed him.
Can you blame me?

40:21.485 --> 40:23.920
He would have ruined me

40:24.088 --> 40:26.389
Andrew Thomson,
you're under arrest

40:26.391 --> 40:28.425
for the murder
of Frank Parker.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.807
(knocking)
Oh.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.676
Miss James,
please come in.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.382
Have a seat.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.657
I was abrupt
with you yesterday

41:00.791 --> 41:03.193
when you told me
about Mr. Desmond.

41:03.327 --> 41:06.196
And I also apologize.

41:06.198 --> 41:09.666
I understand
why you did it.

41:11.635 --> 41:14.137
But I trust that
it won't happen again.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.905
No indeed.

41:15.907 --> 41:19.142
Good. Good.

41:21.712 --> 41:24.881
Dr. Ogden has told me
that you are a Catholic.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.417
Yes.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.420
Catholics face some measure
of prejudice and ill will.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.522
Quite unfairly, I imagine.

41:35.593 --> 41:39.195
One difference, I suppose,
is that people can't tell

41:39.396 --> 41:43.399
that I'm a Catholic
just by looking at me.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.368
What do you do

41:45.603 --> 41:48.071
when you encounter such
treatment, Detective?

41:51.642 --> 41:54.511
I know the truth
about myself, Miss James.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.746
And I know

41:56.914 --> 41:59.415
that no matter
what someone might say

41:59.417 --> 42:01.985
or think about me,

42:02.119 --> 42:05.455
I must be the strongest

42:05.589 --> 42:07.824
and the best version of myself

42:07.958 --> 42:09.826
that I can possibly be.

42:09.994 --> 42:13.229
So go along to get along?
No.

42:13.231 --> 42:17.000
No.

42:17.002 --> 42:19.035
Simply be better

than anyone who might hate you.

42:34.985 --> 42:38.788
I'm a lucky man,
you giving me a second chance.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.361
We have no tables.
Look.

42:45.363 --> 42:48.298
Right there.
Table for two.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.433
We are not
going away, sir.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.939
(chuckling)

43:02.746 --> 43:05.248
You will not
be served.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.718
Then we'll be sitting
here all night.
