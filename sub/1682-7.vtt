00:00.267 --> 00:02.667
<i>Kids, as long as I'd known 
your Uncle Barney,</i>

00:02.667 --> 00:04.468
<i>he'd always had some
pretty strong opinions</i>

00:04.468 --> 00:05.767
<i>on relationships</i>

00:05.767 --> 00:07.034
Your girlfriend?

00:07.034 --> 00:08.167
<i>She's your girl friend?!</i>

00:08.167 --> 00:11.567
She's a girl
and a friend?

00:11.567 --> 00:12.900
(laughs)

00:12.900 --> 00:15.201
Don’t humanize
the enemy, Ted.

00:15.201 --> 00:16.633
But nice to meet you.

00:16.633 --> 00:17.800
Barney Stinson.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.734
<i>And yet,
in the fall of 2009,</i>

00:19.734 --> 00:21.667
<i>he was the one
with the girlfriend.</i>

00:21.667 --> 00:23.101
Go ahead.
Open it.

00:23.101 --> 00:25.067
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

00:26.301 --> 00:27.967
It's my porn collection!

00:27.967 --> 00:29.368
Just kidding.
That would be weird.

00:29.368 --> 00:31.234
It's your porn collection.

00:31.234 --> 00:33.701
It's my porn collection!
I'm giving you my porn.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.968
Now that things are
so great with Robin,

00:35.968 --> 00:37.400
I don't need it anymore.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.334
Wow, you are voluntarily...

00:40.334 --> 00:42.367
giving up your porn?

00:42.367 --> 00:43.834
You really are serious.

00:43.834 --> 00:46.133
Yeah, well, that's obvious.
What does that mean?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.501
Oh, nothing,
it's just, you know,

00:47.501 --> 00:48.701
you got relationship gut.

00:48.701 --> 00:52.868
What?! No, I do not
"got relationship gut."

00:52.868 --> 00:54.234
That is ridiculous.

00:54.234 --> 00:56.767
It's no big deal. I mean, once you're
dating someone,

00:56.767 --> 00:58.734
it's natal to let
things go a little bit.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.534
Trust me,
we've been there.

01:00.534 --> 01:03.934
Yeah. Boy, did i 
pudge you out for a while.

01:05.501 --> 01:07.167
Well, we should get going.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.267
Good-bye, my sweet,
beloved friends.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.301
You have always
been there for me.

01:11.301 --> 01:13.334
You'll be missed.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.734
He's talking to the porn.

01:14.734 --> 01:15.900
Oh.
(chuckles)

01:15.900 --> 01:17.301
Bye, Robin. See you, Robs.
Bye, guys.

01:17.301 --> 01:20.067
God, look at these videos.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.267
<i>Space Orgy?</i>

01:21.267 --> 01:23.900
<i>Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23?</i>

01:23.900 --> 01:25.600
You'd think after
the first 22 parties,

01:25.600 --> 01:26.934
the co-eds wouldn't be
surprised anymore.

01:26.934 --> 01:29.034
So, uh...

01:29.034 --> 01:31.667
we can get rid
of these for you.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.634
Yeah.
No. No-no-no-no-no-no.

01:33.634 --> 01:36.100
It's not a problem.
I'll-I'll take care of them.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.367
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

01:37.367 --> 01:39.501
I mean, no biggie. We can just
swing by the back alley

01:39.501 --> 01:40.868
and drop the box
in the Dumpster.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.667
I see six of the words you just
id on this video label.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.067
Seriously, it's not a big deal.
I will take care of it.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.234
No, 'cause I, I mean...
Leave them!

01:47.234 --> 01:49.434
Okay.

01:50.534 --> 01:52.334
You know, in a way
it sad, right?

01:52.334 --> 01:54.100
I mean, Barney's
giving up his porn.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.367
He's got relationship gut.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.601
They eat at the same
diner every night.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.734
It-it's, like, the end of Barney Stinson
as we know him.

01:59.734 --> 02:01.834
Yeah, well, so what? They're happy.
Yeah, well, we gotta go.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.534
Later. Bye.
Bye-bye.

02:05.801 --> 02:07.901
<i>(whispers):
So what'd you get?
I got Squat.</i>

02:07.901 --> 02:10.133
What are you...?
I thought I saw you take one.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.133
<i>Yeah, I did.
It's called Squat.</i>

02:12.133 --> 02:13.968
Hmm...

02:17.667 --> 02:20.567
<i>ArchiSexTure.</i>

02:21.567 --> 02:24.634
That is not how you spell
"Buckminster Fuller."

02:24.634 --> 02:26.234
<i>Kids, pornography is bad,</i>

02:26.234 --> 02:28.300
<i>and so I was
getting rid of that</i>

02:28.300 --> 02:30.300
<i>vile pornography right away...</i>

02:30.300 --> 02:33.400
I am getting rid of this vile
pornography right away.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.200
<i>...when something terrible
happened.</i>

02:38.701 --> 02:40.267
Oh, no.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.934
Oh, no.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.267
(sensual music from TV begins)

02:50.267 --> 02:51.567
Oh, no.

02:53.501 --> 02:55.968
Oh, no.

02:58.001 --> 03:00.301
<i>WOMAN (on video):
ArchiSexTure...</i>

03:00.301 --> 03:02.334
Hello, Ted.

03:02.334 --> 03:04.934
If you are watching this tape--
and I knew you'd pick this one--

03:04.934 --> 03:07.334
then you are now
in possession of my porn.

03:07.334 --> 03:09.167
This can only mean
one of two things:

03:09.167 --> 03:12.134
either I'm dead, or m
in a committed relationship.

03:12.134 --> 03:16.201
If I'm dead,
I want you to honor my memory

03:16.201 --> 03:18.934
by taking my body
to the Hamptons

03:18.934 --> 03:21.434
<i>and recreating
Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

03:22.067 --> 03:23.533
I want to dance.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.767
I want to have sex with a girl.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.001
And I want to go fishing.

03:28.001 --> 03:31.500
If, on the other hand, I'm
in a committed relationship,

03:31.500 --> 03:36.134
then as your best friend,
I have only one request:

03:36.134 --> 03:38.334
please, for the love of God,

03:38.334 --> 03:40.468
get  out of it!

03:40.468 --> 03:47.834
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny. Corrected by Alex28</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:53.801 --> 03:56.367
I might look happy,
but don't believe it.

03:56.367 --> 03:59.233
Barney Stinson
is meant to be single.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.634
So please, if you value

04:00.634 --> 04:02.867
my best-friendship--
that's right, Marshall,

04:02.867 --> 04:04.500
I'm his best friend,
how does that feel?--

04:04.500 --> 04:07.267
then get me out of this.

04:07.267 --> 04:10.801
And finally, since you were
expecting some porn...

04:14.500 --> 04:17.434
No, no, no baby,
don't worry.

04:17.434 --> 04:20.000
The flashing green
light means it's off.

04:21.034 --> 04:24.300
Are we sure he was
finished talking?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.434
Look, there's
reason we should

04:27.434 --> 04:29.000
take this seriously, right?
Of course not.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.367
This is an old tape.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.234
Barney is happy with Robin.

04:32.234 --> 04:35.234
<i>But over the next couple weeks,
I started to notice things.</i>

04:35.234 --> 04:37.867
<i>Barney and Robin stopped having
crazy adventures.</i>

04:37.867 --> 04:39.501
So what'd you guys
do last night?

04:39.501 --> 04:41.067
I wanted to go
to a concert.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.468
He wanted to go
to a party.

04:42.468 --> 04:44.633
Obviously, we couldn't
do what just one of us wanted,

04:44.633 --> 04:47.767
so we just stayed in,
watched a movie on

04:47.767 --> 04:50.700
<i>It was Legen--
wait for it--</i>

04:50.700 --> 04:52.267
<i>ds of the Fall.</i>

04:52.800 --> 04:55.600
<i>Legends of the Fall!</i>

04:55.600 --> 04:57.900
It was okay.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.501
<i>Barney stopped being himself.</i>

04:59.501 --> 05:01.468
Hey, Barney, I'm, uh, I'm
chatting up this girl

05:01.468 --> 05:04.000
over there, and I could use a
little help landing the plane.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Sorry, Ted, I'm my own
wingman tonight.

05:11.067 --> 05:14.134
<i>And Robin got annoyed
at everything he said.</i>

05:14.134 --> 05:15.667
So, how are u two?

05:15.667 --> 05:17.334
So great.
Oh... shut up.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.067
Relationships are the best.
Shut up.

05:19.067 --> 05:24.601
Shut up, shut up, shut up...
The sharing, the compromise, 

05:25.234 --> 05:27.534
The monogamy, can't beat it.
Catchphrase! Yes!

05:28.667 --> 05:30.667
<i>But the worse they got...</i>

05:30.667 --> 05:33.034
I'm full... sweetie.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.367
<i>...the more they kept saying
things were great.</i>

05:35.367 --> 05:37.733
<i>Now, the truth is,
Barney and Robin</i>

05:37.733 --> 05:39.334
<i>only kind of let themselves go
a little bit.</i>

05:39.334 --> 05:41.200
<i>But I swear, after a few more weeks,</i>

05:41.200 --> 05:43.600
<i>to us, they seemed like this.</i>

05:45.567 --> 05:47.701
I'll be there...

05:47.701 --> 05:50.634
in a minute.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.200
Hey.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.400
They're killing each other.
They love each other.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.901
Barney and Robin
love each other,

05:59.901 --> 06:01.567
but they're not Barney
and Robin anymore.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.101
They're the fat guy
and the old lady.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.567
My favorite '70s detective show.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.967
Look, it's so ear.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.333
Barney's been overeating

06:08.333 --> 06:10.333
because he hates being
tied down like this.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.200
And Robin's stressing out
because she hates

06:12.200 --> 06:13.300
what Barney's turned into.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.300
No, they're a perfect match.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.434
Well, maybe that's the problem.

06:16.434 --> 06:17.801
Maybe they're too similar.

06:17.801 --> 06:18.834
It must be tough having

06:18.834 --> 06:20.867
two alpha dogs
in one relationship.

06:20.868 --> 06:21.967
We have two alpha dogs in our relationship.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.567
Sure we do, sweetie.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.734
If they're not happy,

06:25.734 --> 06:27.200
why don't they just break up?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.333
Because they're too stubborn.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.233
Neither one of them
wants to be the first

06:30.233 --> 06:31.467
to admit that they want out.

06:31.467 --> 06:32.934
They're playing
Relationship Chicken.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.934
I think Barney ate
the relationship chicken.

06:34.934 --> 06:36.267
(laughing)

06:36.267 --> 06:37.634
Ted, it's just a rough patch.

06:37.634 --> 06:40.200
It takes time getting used
to being with someone else.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.434
And they're both...

06:41.434 --> 06:43.600
What the nice word for selfish?
Independent.

06:43.601 --> 06:44.600
Independent.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.267
Every relationship
goes through this.

06:46.267 --> 06:49.400
It's true, um,
I have this astronaut friend--

06:49.400 --> 06:51.134
totally loved his fiancée.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.534
And then, the day before his
mission she caught him

06:53.534 --> 06:56.967
with, like, four other chicks,
a couple of dudes.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.534
Things got really tense.

06:58.534 --> 06:59.801
Um, finally, she ended up

06:59.801 --> 07:01.034
sneaking onto the space
shuttle...

07:01.034 --> 07:03.367
<i>Are you talking about Space Orgy?
Yes, I am.</i>

07:04.233 --> 07:05.600
Ted, it's just a rough patch.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.934
Just let things
run their course.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.500
She's right.
But...

07:08.500 --> 07:10.168
Two-to-one, Ted.
Leave them alone

07:10.168 --> 07:13.467
<i>So I did leave them alone.
But that weekend...</i>

07:13.467 --> 07:15.068
(sighs)

07:15.068 --> 07:17.867
Have you noticed how beef ribs
used to always be disgusting,

07:17.867 --> 07:19.500
and then recently,
they found a way

07:19.500 --> 07:22.267
to make them really
delicious instead?

07:22.767 --> 07:25.634
Okay, Barney, I'm going to go
ahead and ask you this head-on

07:25.634 --> 07:27.301
Are you happy with Robin?

07:27.301 --> 07:28.534
Are you kidding?!

07:28.534 --> 07:30.301
How could I not be happy
with Robin?

07:30.301 --> 07:32.833
It's Robin!
So are you happy?

07:32.833 --> 07:34.800
I can't believe you would even
ask me that.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.767
I mean, yes,
we fight all the time,

07:36.767 --> 07:40.067
but you know what they say
about relationships:

07:40.067 --> 07:42.800
Every moment's a battle.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.168
So are you happy?
Do you know what goes

07:45.168 --> 07:47.367
hand in hand with fighting?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.367
The makeup sex.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.367
Which is different

07:52.367 --> 07:55.500
when you're in a loving,
long-term relationship.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.600
Heads we have sex,

07:57.600 --> 08:01.233
tail we order a whole pizza
and just lay here moaning.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.233
Oh, great.
Let the coin decide.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.300
Which was pizza again?
Tails.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.567
It was tails.

08:10.567 --> 08:13.300
Sex-- am I right?

08:13.300 --> 08:15.300
Thank God that's mostly over.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.701
(hiccups)

08:16.701 --> 08:17.901
I'm still hungry.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.434
You hungry?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.667
We have to break them up.

08:26.334 --> 08:28.267
You're right.
Barney and Robin

08:28.267 --> 08:29.767
are miserable together,

08:29.767 --> 08:31.167
but they're too stubborn
to admit it.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.034
So we had to get them
to break up.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.034
How do we do that?
We unleash...

08:35.034 --> 08:37.234
the Kraken.

08:37.234 --> 08:39.732
<i>Kids, as you know,
earlier that year</i>

08:39.732 --> 08:41.900
<i>I'd learned that Lily had
broken up not one,</i>

08:41.900 --> 08:46.167
<i>not two, but seven
of my past relationships.</i>

08:46.167 --> 08:48.067
Forget it.
I'm retired.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.467
I'm out of the game.
But nobody's better than you.

08:50.467 --> 08:53.568
I'm telling you,
I swore off that rocket.

08:53.568 --> 08:54.800
I've gone legit.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.733
I'm a matchmaker now.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.734
Set me up with someone.
Whoa, I'm just starting out.

08:59.734 --> 09:01.667
Please. You've, you've
got to break them up.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.867
This relationship
is killing them.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.801
I know it is,
but I've learned my lesson.

09:05.801 --> 09:07.267
No more interfering.

09:07.267 --> 09:08.801
Let things run their course.

09:08.801 --> 09:11.634
It's two-to-one.
Yes, but t one is me.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.168
All right, we don't need her.

09:15.168 --> 09:17.134
We can break them up on our own.
How?

09:17.134 --> 09:19.801
Okay remember when
Robin and I were dating?

09:19.801 --> 09:22.934
What was the one big thing that
really freaked her out?

09:22.934 --> 09:26.200
No, no, no, no, no--Ted, you can't.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.333
No! No-no-no!

09:28.333 --> 09:29.400
What are you talking about?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.034
This! This is
what I'm talking about.

09:31.034 --> 09:33.267
What is this doing
in my champagne?

09:33.267 --> 09:34.367
If we make Robin think

09:34.367 --> 09:36.001
for even a second
that Barney is proposing,

09:36.001 --> 09:37.400
she'll lose it
and they'll break up.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.034
That's crazy.
Why don't we just,

09:39.034 --> 09:40.333
uh, like, lead Barney
into temptation?

09:40.333 --> 09:42.634
We'll find some hot woman
hit on him...

09:46.467 --> 09:47.801
Okay, the ring thing.

09:54.301 --> 09:56.434
Stakeout van.
What?

09:56.434 --> 09:57.700
We should've gotten
a stakeout van.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.900
We could've ordered pizza,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.067
look through
big binoculars and said,

10:01.067 --> 10:03.434
"This ain't what I signed up
for," stuff like that.

10:03.434 --> 10:05.000
Shh, here
comes the waiter.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.800
Please shut up.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.934
What?

10:08.934 --> 10:11.401
Oh, I thought
you said something, sorry.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.134
Is that an engagement ring?

10:20.067 --> 10:21.000
Are you...?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.467
Oh, no. No.
That is not .

10:23.467 --> 10:25.568
They must have delivered it
to the wrong table.

10:25.568 --> 10:26.934
Can you imagine

10:26.934 --> 10:28.733
us getting married?

10:28.733 --> 10:32.134
Well, we are committed
to each other.

10:32.134 --> 10:33.733
Most of your stuff is

10:33.733 --> 10:34.767
already at my apartment.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.000
It might make taxes easier.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.634
It'd speed up your citizenship.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.700
"Scherbatsky"
is so hard to spell.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.067
My mom would be so happy.

10:43.668 --> 10:46.034
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, no reason not to.

10:46.034 --> 10:49.134
We're getting married!
Not so loud, geez.

10:49.134 --> 10:50.167
What did you do?

10:50.167 --> 10:51.833
I am furious right now!

10:51.833 --> 10:52.967
This is so wrong!

10:52.967 --> 10:54.301
Lily, will you be
my maid of honor?

10:54.301 --> 10:56.267
Oh, my God! I would love to!

10:58.333 --> 11:00.567
Are you out of your mind?!

11:00.567 --> 11:02.934
You knew they were playing
Relationship Chicken,

11:02.935 --> 11:03.934
And what did you do?

11:03.934 --> 11:06.801
You put an engagement ring
in front of them!

11:06.801 --> 11:08.500
Okay, that's it.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.200
I'm taking over.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.333
Coming out of retirement
for one, last breakup.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.634
Oh-ho! All right.
Oh, yes!

11:15.634 --> 11:16.634
How are we going to do it?

11:16.634 --> 11:17.734
These guys are in so deep,

11:17.734 --> 11:19.134
just one fight
ain't going to do it.

11:19.134 --> 11:20.134
We need

11:20.134 --> 11:22.300
to reignite
the four biggest fights

11:22.300 --> 11:24.333
they've ever been in
all at once.

11:24.833 --> 11:28.601
Number one:
The Battle of the Dirty Dishes.

11:31.467 --> 11:34.967
Number two:
The Ex-Girlfriend Conflict.

11:34.967 --> 11:36.167
(laughing)
Hey.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.833
Don't you know
that girl over there?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.733
No, I don't think .

11:39.733 --> 11:40.967
(cell phone drops)
No, in fact,

11:40.967 --> 11:42.634
I have definitely not--
Oh, hey, it's Meg.

11:43.934 --> 11:46.967
Wow, I am certainly not comparing you two
in my mind right now.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.334
Whoops! Hey, will you get that for me, please?
Really?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.601
What's the problem? I'm not... Why do you keep-- 
You're embarrassing me in public.

11:51.601 --> 11:53.367
You’re constantly putting me in these positions.
Oh, my God...

11:53.367 --> 11:56.900
<i>Number three:
The Star Wars Altercation.</i>

11:56.900 --> 11:59.367
Isn't it time you got
rid of your stupid doll?

11:59.367 --> 12:02.167
It's not a doll.
It's a Storm Trooper.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.134
Uh, he's wearing a diaper.

12:04.134 --> 12:06.767
It's not a diaper, Robin,
it's protective armor.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.534
Storm Trooper?
More like storm-pooper.

12:09.534 --> 12:11.767
Stop it. <i>(blows raspberry):</i>
Oh!

12:11.767 --> 12:13.833
Oh, it sounds like
your storm-pooper here

12:13.833 --> 12:16.034
needs a changing. Okay, you know what?
I'm sick of it.

12:16.034 --> 12:18.234
What? I didn't say anything. I'm sick of the jokes--
the joke about the magic,

12:18.234 --> 12:19.833
the joke about the stormtrooper...
I can't... I can't joke?

12:19.833 --> 12:21.634
And of course the biggie:

12:22.634 --> 12:25.000
The Canadian/American War.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.267
Thank God that song's over.

12:27.267 --> 12:29.634
Who the hell was 
that old lady singing?

12:29.634 --> 12:33.034
Okay, you know that Neil Young
is my favorite musician.

12:33.034 --> 12:35.100
Right. Now, was that the same
old lady who played

12:35.100 --> 12:36.967
Archie Bunker's wife
in All in the Family,

12:36.967 --> 12:38.100
or just sound-alike?

12:38.100 --> 12:40.967
Neil Young is
a Canadian treasure.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.534
Do not make fun of Neil Young.

12:43.534 --> 12:45.434
Robin, I would
never make fun of

12:45.434 --> 12:48.100
a defenseless old lady with
vocal cord paralysis... ever.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.967
Oh, here we go. In public?
Really? In public?
Yeah, in public. I'll go there.

12:50.967 --> 12:53.467
What's the problem? Everything
I say...
We're gonna have a fight in public?

12:53.467 --> 12:54.534
I got it.

12:54.534 --> 12:56.534
I got it.
We e-mail them pictures

12:56.534 --> 12:58.467
reminding them
of each of these fights.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.434
You child.

13:01.434 --> 13:02.700
Here's how it goes down.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.668
They're at the diner...

13:03.668 --> 13:04.767
LILY:
First, rekindling

13:04.767 --> 13:06.567
<i>the Canadian-American debate,</i>

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:11.734 --> 13:12.667
Alan Thicke?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.667
Oh, right.
Robin knew him

13:14.667 --> 13:15.634
back when she was a singer.

13:15.634 --> 13:17.367
Yeah, and they still
keep in touch.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.467
I already got his number
off her phone.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.967
Seriously... amateurs.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.967
<i>LILY:

<i>Crazy Meg shows up.</i>

13:28.134 --> 13:32.200
<i>Then, a stormtrooper happens

<i>And just when they can't take
anything more,</i>

13:34.233 --> 13:35.600

<i>Dirty dishes.</i>

* Climb aboard

13:48.801 --> 13:50.333
Lily.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.600
This is your masterpiece.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
We're getting a stakeout van!

13:55.600 --> 13:56.934
A station wagon?

13:56.934 --> 13:59.634
Really? You rented
a station wagon?

13:59.634 --> 14:01.500
Yeah, a van cost,
like, 25 bucks more.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.867
A station wagon?

14:05.567 --> 14:06.867
Greetings, Will Robinson!

14:06.867 --> 14:08.667
Where's the birthday
boy or girl?

14:08.667 --> 14:10.434
Hey, climb on in.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.567
What the hell is this?

14:11.567 --> 14:13.600
Oh, they didn't have
any stormtroopers,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.934
so I had to get a different
robot; this'll still work.

14:15.934 --> 14:17.200
Different robot?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.034
Stormtroopers
aren't robots.

14:19.034 --> 14:20.267
Of course
they're robots!

14:20.267 --> 14:22.500
"Must kill Luke Skywalker."

14:22.500 --> 14:24.534
<i>Um, nobody says that
in Star Wars at all, ever.</i>

14:24.534 --> 14:26.267
That's a really lousy
robot voice, honey.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.168
Someone order an
extra large sausage?

14:28.168 --> 14:31.134
Hey, one of Barney's videos
starts off just like that.

14:31.134 --> 14:33.934
Hey, guys, Barney's ordering...
five of something.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.300
I don't know if
it's gonna fit in here.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.600
Okay, now you're
just quoting the video.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.667
Still ordering.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.500
Waiter's taking out
a second pad.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.834
Yeah, okay, well,
we need it in here.

14:41.834 --> 14:42.867
We're on a stakeout.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.233
Shouldn't you be in a van?

14:44.233 --> 14:46.500
Thank you!
A van cost more.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.168
Score me a slice, Will Robinson!
No, no-no-no!

14:49.168 --> 14:50.800
You get a stain on that costume,
they're gonna charge us.

14:50.801 --> 14:52.301
Dude, will you just chill
about money?

14:52.500 --> 14:55.001
Yeah, let the stormtrooper
have a slice.

14:55.001 --> 14:57.101
BOTH:
It's not a stormtrooper!

14:57.101 --> 14:58.801
Hi, Lily

14:58.801 --> 15:00.934
Sorry I'm late.
I was looking for a van.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.834
Thank you!
$25!

15:02.834 --> 15:04.034
So should I go
say hi to Robin?

15:04.034 --> 15:05.134
Oh, not yet;
get in the car.

15:05.134 --> 15:07.267
Okay, so wait,
wait, wait.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.400
When they blew up
the Death Star,

15:09.400 --> 15:10.901
knowing full well
there were thousands

15:10.901 --> 15:13.400
of stormtroopers on it,
those were people?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.034
It was called
the Death Star, baby.

15:15.034 --> 15:17.034
They knew what
they were getting into.

15:17.034 --> 15:19.200
Look, I don't want to play
the "I'm Alan Thicke" card,

15:19.200 --> 15:21.534
but I really do have a dinner
to get to.

15:21.534 --> 15:23.233
Someone has got to
take this sausage!

15:23.733 --> 15:24.967
Okay, were you in that video?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.601
Were you the guy
with the farmer tan?

15:26.601 --> 15:29.000
Jonesin' for some 'za,
Will Robinson!

15:29.000 --> 15:30.634
Come on, I'm Alan Thicke!

15:30.635 --> 15:32.634
This ain't what I signed up for.

15:32.634 --> 15:35.367
Hey! That's what...
Hey, you know what? Everyone, stop!

15:35.367 --> 15:37.800
Alan Thicke, shut up! Marshall,
it's a station wagon.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.467
Get over it!
Ted, stop talking about porn!

15:40.467 --> 15:41.634
And for the love of God,

15:41.634 --> 15:43.568
somebody get the stormtrooper
some pizza!

15:43.568 --> 15:45.100
TED & MARSHALL:
It's not a stormtrooper!

15:45.100 --> 15:47.733
Crap!

15:47.733 --> 15:49.301
They see us!

15:49.302 --> 15:51.302
Danger! Danger!

15:57.134 --> 15:58.134
(whispers):
Are you sure they saw us?

15:58.134 --> 15:59.568
(whispers): Yes.
Hey!

15:59.568 --> 16:00.733
(screams)

16:00.733 --> 16:03.434
Can I go talk to Barney now?
I'm so excited!

16:03.434 --> 16:05.833
Do you really think
he's going to propose to me?

16:05.833 --> 16:07.367
Oh, honey...

16:07.367 --> 16:09.167
Forget it, Crazy Meg,
we've been made.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.634
If we try anything now,
they're going to know it's us.

16:10.634 --> 16:12.801
I, I think we should all just
go home...
No!

16:12.801 --> 16:14.767
This is my masterpiece.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.133
So what if they saw us?

16:16.133 --> 16:17.367
It'll still work.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.667
Stop it. We'll think
of something else.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.334
Let me repeat:
"I am Alan Thicke."

16:21.334 --> 16:23.801
(gasps):
You're Alan Thicke?!

16:23.801 --> 16:25.968
No.

16:25.968 --> 16:28.133
Alan Thicke, you're up.
Get on out there.

16:29.367 --> 16:31.334
<i>NARRATOR:

16:31.334 --> 16:33.534
<i>First, Alan Thicke.</i>

16:34.634 --> 16:37.200
<i>Followed by Crazy Meg.</i>

16:37.200 --> 16:39.767
<i>Then, the robot.</i>

16:39.767 --> 16:42.567
<i>And finally, the dirty dishes.</i>

16:45.401 --> 16:46.900
<i>But by the end of it...</i>

16:47.934 --> 16:49.900
LILY:
They're kissing?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.334
They shouldn't be kissing!

16:51.334 --> 16:52.867
Why isn't this working?

16:52.867 --> 16:54.600
Because they're in love.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.767
It really was
just a rough patch.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.001
What the hell am I doing?

17:04.166 --> 17:06.601
This whole thing was a mistake.

17:07.434 --> 17:09.032
So, uh,

17:09.032 --> 17:11.133
any of you dudes
want to get high?

17:13.367 --> 17:15.467
I never thought I'd be
saying this tonight, but...

17:15.467 --> 17:17.534
to Barney and Robin,
the happy couple.

<i>And that was the moment
we unlearned that other lesson</i>

17:31.001 --> 17:33.034
<i>we had just learned
a few seconds earlier.</i>

17:33.034 --> 17:35.500
<i>You see, earlier that night,
when Lily thought</i>

17:35.500 --> 17:37.567
<i>Barney and Robin
had spotted her,</i>

17:37.567 --> 17:39.334
<i>this is what they really saw.</i>

17:41.567 --> 17:45.334
Why do that fat guy
and old lady keep sta...?

17:47.134 --> 17:50.401
Oh, my God. That's us!

17:50.401 --> 17:52.533
Look at us.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.234
Did  always look this awful?

17:56.468 --> 17:58.301
Robin, I'm not happy.

17:58.301 --> 17:59.767
I mean,

17:59.767 --> 18:01.767
I wish I was.
Nothing would make me happier

18:01.767 --> 18:03.567
than being happy, but...

18:03.567 --> 18:05.201
I'm not.

18:06.201 --> 18:08.101
What are we doing wrong?

18:08.101 --> 18:09.267
We love each other.

18:09.267 --> 18:12.234
I mean, if this don't work,
what will?

18:12.234 --> 18:13.700
We're so similar.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.334
We both like scotch.
We're both awesome.

18:16.334 --> 18:18.101
You know, maybe that's it.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.201
Maybe there's just
too much awesome here.

18:20.201 --> 18:21.934
Exactly.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.234
Two awesomes
cancel each other out,

18:24.234 --> 18:27.900
and I'm tired of being
cancelled out.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.800
Me, too.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.234
Are we breaking up?

18:33.234 --> 18:35.301
I think so.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.101
Ah, crap.

18:39.101 --> 18:40.967
Now comes the next part.

18:40.967 --> 18:44.167
The part where you and can't
go back to being friends.

18:45.167 --> 18:49.468
Well, maybe this isn't
a breakup.

18:49.468 --> 18:52.967
Maybe this is two friends

18:52.967 --> 18:55.500
getting back together.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
ALAN THICKE: Robin!
Ooh!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.034
Alan...

19:01.034 --> 19:03.468
Oh, it's always so great
to see a fellow hoser.

19:03.468 --> 19:05.567
Yes! Oh, is true.
MEG: Barney!

19:05.567 --> 19:06.934
Good news!
I forgive you

19:06.934 --> 19:08.468
for the whole
restraining order thing.

19:08.468 --> 19:10.334
Uh, hi.

19:10.334 --> 19:12.434
Whoa, is that a stormtrooper?

19:12.434 --> 19:14.667
That's not a stormtr...
You want to get out of here?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.201
Yeah.

19:16.201 --> 19:18.468
See you guys.
Okay.

19:18.468 --> 19:19.500
See you, Alan.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.101
(chuckling)

19:21.101 --> 19:22.967
So you still on 73rd Street?

19:22.967 --> 19:26.001
How do you know that?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.567
Getting back together

19:28.567 --> 19:30.734
as friends... I like that.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.734
One more for the road?

19:39.501 --> 19:41.300
And, I mean, who knows?

19:41.300 --> 19:43.000
Maybe, when,
like, you turn 40,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.234
if you haven't found anyone...

19:44.234 --> 19:45.767
Oh, I already have
that deal with Ted.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.734
Oh, right. Stupid.

19:48.734 --> 19:50.467
Well, maybe when you turn 39,

19:50.467 --> 19:51.801
if you haven't
found anyone...

19:51.801 --> 19:54.467
<i>It turns out
that they really did</i>

19:54.467 --> 19:56.834
<i>just need to let things
run their course.</i>

19:58.100 --> 19:59.334
So, uh, how's Barney doing?

19:59.334 --> 20:00.734
He's okay, I think.

20:00.734 --> 20:03.734
It might be a while before
he fully recovers, but. Ooh!

20:03.734 --> 20:05.534
Did you guys just feel a chill?

20:05.534 --> 20:06.767
Yeah.

Well, Robin,
I'm glad we could catch up.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.134
Oh, yeah, let's
do it again soon.

20:31.134 --> 20:33.101
I love that you guys
are still friends

20:33.101 --> 20:35.101
so long after you
did that music video.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.067
Yeah.
The music?

20:36.067 --> 20:38.767
Oh, the "Sandcastles"
video, yes!

20:38.767 --> 20:40.700
<i>Yes, we did that
together, too.</i>

20:40.700 --> 20:42.934
What do you mean "too"?
Oh, we had this

20:42.934 --> 20:46.567
failed Canadian
TV variety show we did.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.200
That was so embarrassing.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.801
Imagine what would happen
if anybody ever got
their hands on that?

20:50.801 --> 20:52.501
(chuckling)

20:52.501 --> 20:54.634
Oh, you.
