03:59.300 --> 04:00.568
You might need that.

04:01.235 --> 04:02.236
Where'd you find this?

04:02.803 --> 04:05.739
It was in one of those cartons.

04:09.509 --> 04:10.310
Needs oil.

04:10.710 --> 04:11.711
Who doesn't?

04:13.980 --> 04:14.714
You ready?

04:16.582 --> 04:17.950
- I'm not going.
- Mom!

04:18.851 --> 04:20.820
I've got two children,
I don't need a third.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.255
Why is it so important that I go?

04:23.989 --> 04:26.591
For one thing, it'd be nice if you
just left the room.

04:27.526 --> 04:29.494
Besides, these are your old friends.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.564
They probably won't remember me.

04:34.932 --> 04:36.701
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?

04:37.435 --> 04:39.270
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.

04:40.004 --> 04:42.873
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.942
- You never see each other.
- We still won't.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.978
She'll be traveling around
with that husband of hers.

04:49.846 --> 04:51.481
Frank. He has a name.

04:52.181 --> 04:53.816
He's always been very nice to you.

04:54.951 --> 04:56.318
He makes me nervous.

04:57.386 --> 04:59.788
There's a lot of reasons
why I can't go.

05:01.123 --> 05:01.990
Honey...

05:03.025 --> 05:06.027
...I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.

05:07.429 --> 05:09.964
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.

05:10.898 --> 05:14.402
When will you realize how special it
was, how much it all meant?

05:17.971 --> 05:20.374
I know how you feel. I really do.

05:22.075 --> 05:23.343
But you're going.

05:28.214 --> 05:29.315
Car.

05:31.851 --> 05:34.320
- Car, train, bus. I'm tired already.
- Sleep on the plane.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.688
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?

05:37.389 --> 05:38.123
Wisenheimer.

05:38.523 --> 05:40.992
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.

05:42.794 --> 05:43.728
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.

05:44.696 --> 05:46.197
Jeffrey, come here.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.636
No matter what your brother does,
he's littler than you.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.672
Give him a chance to shoot. Promise?

05:58.075 --> 05:59.576
Bobby, come here.

06:01.711 --> 06:02.712
Kill him.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.548
Come on, you'll miss your plane.

06:31.405 --> 06:33.307
I still think I shouldn't go.

07:47.941 --> 07:49.009
Get a hit, Beans!

08:00.386 --> 08:02.521
I'm coming, Mae! I'm coming!

08:12.864 --> 08:15.266
This week in the world of sports.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.769
With the boys overseas
and off to war...

08:19.536 --> 08:21.672
...baseball pitches in
for the war effort.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.641
Trading bats for bullets,
Yankee Joe DiMaggio...

08:25.342 --> 08:27.177
...promises to give
those Nazis a jolt.

08:28.344 --> 08:30.313
Ace fireballer Bob Feller...

08:31.047 --> 08:33.381
...has traded Cleveland gray
for Navy blue.

08:34.350 --> 08:36.118
Baseball's biggest stars say...

08:36.852 --> 08:39.154
..."Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. "

08:39.955 --> 08:42.357
Not to mention the Indians,
Red Sox and Tigers.

08:43.225 --> 08:45.760
And they won't come back
till it's over, over there.

08:48.496 --> 08:52.133
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner
Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king...

08:53.334 --> 08:56.703
...met with other team owners at
the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist...

08:57.838 --> 09:01.141
...that baseball may be shut down
for the duration of the war.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.011
Harvey's promotional whiz kid,
Ira Lowenstein...

09:06.012 --> 09:09.382
...has been given the job of
figuring out how to keep baseball going.

09:10.649 --> 09:12.551
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.

09:21.893 --> 09:23.261
Strike 2!

09:33.670 --> 09:34.905
Hey, fatso!

09:35.405 --> 09:37.874
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?

09:39.843 --> 09:41.211
Strike 3!

09:46.048 --> 09:47.049
Kit!

09:48.250 --> 09:50.919
- Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
- I can hit it.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.655
- You can't.
- I can.

09:54.356 --> 09:56.391
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.

09:57.158 --> 09:58.259
I will!

09:59.394 --> 10:02.330
Listen. There's a big hole
on the right side. Don't look.

10:03.264 --> 10:05.299
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.001
Batter up!

10:09.103 --> 10:10.103
No high ones.

10:10.671 --> 10:11.872
I like the high ones!

10:12.372 --> 10:14.074
- Mule!
- Nag!

10:22.581 --> 10:25.184
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.

10:30.789 --> 10:32.057
Strike 1!

10:43.033 --> 10:44.134
Strike 2!

10:45.636 --> 10:46.503
Too high.

10:53.610 --> 10:54.978
All right, Kit. Look it over!

10:55.578 --> 10:57.146
Look it over there!

10:58.047 --> 10:59.482
Strike 3!

11:06.388 --> 11:08.523
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!

11:09.257 --> 11:11.025
Better luck next time!

11:11.926 --> 11:13.828
Knock it out of here! Okay, Dottie!

11:16.030 --> 11:17.131
Batter up!

11:25.272 --> 11:26.439
Right in here!

11:31.077 --> 11:32.578
Bring them in there, Dottie!

11:35.715 --> 11:36.582
Ball!

11:43.488 --> 11:45.390
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!

11:46.224 --> 11:48.393
One hit and we win!

11:59.169 --> 12:01.071
That's it, Dottie! You did it!

12:04.074 --> 12:05.375
That's the ball game!

12:16.985 --> 12:19.354
Hey, Kit! What are you swinging
those high ones for?

12:20.155 --> 12:22.290
Good thing your sister bailed you out.

12:23.925 --> 12:26.094
How about the two bucks you owe me
for this game?

12:26.828 --> 12:29.096
Kit! Wait up, I'll give you a ride!

12:32.299 --> 12:33.434
Stop kicking the rocks.

12:33.934 --> 12:34.868
I'm sorry.

12:35.636 --> 12:38.705
- That game just made me so mad.
- We won. Get mad if we lose.

12:39.706 --> 12:41.674
That last pitch was
right down the middle.

12:42.609 --> 12:44.644
If I'd have swung at that,
I'd be the hero.

12:45.445 --> 12:48.047
- You got me so crazy-
- I only said lay off the high ones.

12:48.948 --> 12:50.983
"Good thing your sister bailed you out. "

12:52.851 --> 12:55.520
"Kit, why don't you get your sister
to teach you how to hit?"

12:56.455 --> 12:58.423
"Why can't you be beautiful
like your sister?"

12:59.157 --> 13:00.592
What idiot said that?

13:01.192 --> 13:02.193
No one.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.162
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!

13:07.765 --> 13:09.667
You ever hear Dad
introduce us to people?

13:11.101 --> 13:12.803
"This is our daughter Dottie.

13:13.470 --> 13:16.339
This is our other daughter,
Dottie's sister.

13:17.941 --> 13:20.076
Should've just had you
and bought a dog.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.946
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- He's one step up from dating pigs.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.382
But an important step.

13:30.052 --> 13:31.820
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?

13:32.521 --> 13:35.457
- Because you are.
- Can't even let me walk faster than you?

13:45.666 --> 13:47.801
Girls, you got chores to do.

13:52.505 --> 13:54.841
Don't run! You'll scare the chickens!

13:56.509 --> 13:58.477
I don't have time for these games.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.814
- Why are you running?
- You can go faster than that.

14:02.514 --> 14:03.682
Your legs are longer.

14:04.216 --> 14:05.584
- I win!
- Barely.

14:28.371 --> 14:29.039
Hey!

14:30.974 --> 14:31.975
Hey, yourself.

14:34.377 --> 14:35.244
Doesn't that hurt them?

14:37.146 --> 14:38.013
Doesn't seem to.

14:38.881 --> 14:40.983
It would bruise the hell out of me.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.751
Who are you?

14:43.218 --> 14:44.920
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.

14:45.687 --> 14:48.556
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.

14:49.524 --> 14:51.292
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?

14:51.993 --> 14:53.160
You know, the candy?

14:53.661 --> 14:55.996
Yeah, we feed them to the cows
when they're constipated.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.099
He's starting
a girls' baseball league...

14:59.900 --> 15:02.169
...so we can make a buck
while the boys are overseas.

15:03.003 --> 15:03.937
Wanna play?

15:04.871 --> 15:08.871
Nice retort. Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.677
Professional baseball?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.147
They'll pay you $75 a week.

15:16.615 --> 15:17.916
We only make $30 at the dairy.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.852
Then this would be more,
wouldn't it? Interested?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.355
Come on. $75 a week?

15:25.757 --> 15:27.525
Pull her leg. Mine are long enough.

15:28.192 --> 15:30.027
Look, your country needs you.

15:30.695 --> 15:33.297
You can not only play ball,
but you're kind of a dolly.

15:34.131 --> 15:36.466
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.469
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.972
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.174
We want girls easy on the eye.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.044
I'll go. I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?

15:48.844 --> 15:51.714
I don't want you! I want her!
The one who hit the ball!

15:52.614 --> 15:54.316
You can climb back under the cow.

15:55.217 --> 15:56.585
She's good. She's very good.

15:57.119 --> 15:59.521
She pitches. She didn't today,
because she did yesterday.

16:00.388 --> 16:02.423
Thanks for that special glimpse
into her life.

16:03.257 --> 16:04.058
I want you.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.227
You I saw, you I like.

16:06.861 --> 16:08.295
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.

16:09.763 --> 16:11.198
What do you say?
Are you in?

16:11.765 --> 16:12.432
No, thanks.

16:14.601 --> 16:15.735
"No, thanks"?

16:16.570 --> 16:17.937
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.

16:18.538 --> 16:20.707
If you wanna pluck cows,
that's your business.

16:21.441 --> 16:23.009
You know something? You're not nice.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.745
That one hurt. So long, milkmaids.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.452
No, wait!

16:35.120 --> 16:38.356
Just watch me pitch. Dottie,
get your mitt! I'll throw him a few.

16:41.659 --> 16:42.760
Now look...

16:43.294 --> 16:46.163
...I know the goods when I see
the goods, and she's the goods.

16:47.765 --> 16:48.866
I'm sorry.

16:55.672 --> 16:57.373
Will you shut up?!

16:59.242 --> 17:00.476
You're a pitcher, huh?

17:05.614 --> 17:07.950
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.185
If you stink, it only costs us
the train ticket.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.555
Get these wild animals away from me!

17:14.222 --> 17:15.857
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?

17:20.161 --> 17:21.162
Come on, Dottie.

17:21.628 --> 17:24.298
You got the whole rest of your life
to hang around here.

17:25.232 --> 17:27.334
Never go anywhere. Never do anything.

17:28.568 --> 17:31.438
I'm married. I'm happy.
It's what I want. Don't confuse things.

17:37.410 --> 17:39.178
But can't you just have this first?

17:39.912 --> 17:43.482
Just so you can say you once
did something? Something special?

17:47.085 --> 17:48.086
Goodness sake, Kit!

17:48.753 --> 17:51.689
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.

17:53.791 --> 17:55.092
Please, Dottie?

17:56.927 --> 17:58.429
I gotta get out of here.

17:59.930 --> 18:01.365
I'm nothing here.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.909
In the Pacific Northwest,
my territory...

18:14.677 --> 18:18.313
...we have increased sales 106%
in the last 12-month period.

18:19.481 --> 18:20.983
And this with a war on!

18:24.953 --> 18:28.022
You know, if I had your job,
I'd kill myself.

18:29.957 --> 18:32.360
Sit here. I'll see if I can
dig up a pistol.

18:34.528 --> 18:37.131
Every trip I take, I gotta sit
next to one of these guys.

18:38.031 --> 18:39.333
I'm just too friendly.

18:39.933 --> 18:40.867
Hey, isn't that-?

18:44.971 --> 18:47.707
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.

18:48.975 --> 18:50.209
Mr. Capadino!

18:50.810 --> 18:51.811
I got her! Look!

18:53.279 --> 18:55.247
- Sir, your knee.
- Like it?

18:56.148 --> 18:57.516
Stop the train!

19:02.220 --> 19:03.655
Come on! Come on!

19:08.726 --> 19:09.827
Give me that bag!

19:23.006 --> 19:24.974
Did you promise the cows you'd write?

19:34.149 --> 19:35.784
When do we get to Chicago?

19:37.252 --> 19:39.721
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.

19:41.022 --> 19:42.590
Gotta look at another girl.

19:43.691 --> 19:45.126
Hope you're not jealous.

19:51.932 --> 19:52.599
I'm sorry.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.768
It's okay, honey. That was good form.

19:58.171 --> 19:59.172
Thattagirl!

19:59.839 --> 20:01.340
Good, honey. Good.

20:04.577 --> 20:05.311
Nice, nice.

20:05.711 --> 20:06.812
That's a rope, honey.

20:08.380 --> 20:09.815
Good girl. Good, good.

20:11.483 --> 20:12.350
Right, too high.

20:12.984 --> 20:14.686
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.

20:22.359 --> 20:23.093
Okay, Marla.

20:23.594 --> 20:24.461
Now lefty.

20:39.241 --> 20:40.042
She's really good.

20:41.443 --> 20:42.244
She's your daughter?

20:46.214 --> 20:47.916
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.

20:49.351 --> 20:51.886
Coach said if she was a boy,
she'd go to the state tournament.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.023
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to
the Yankees instead of living here."

21:00.394 --> 21:02.096
That's enough.
You can bring her over.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.630
Okay, Marla.

21:04.231 --> 21:04.898
Come here.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.099
Boys!

21:06.533 --> 21:07.634
Hit the showers!

21:16.642 --> 21:18.010
Take off your hat, honey.

21:30.755 --> 21:31.989
We'll let you know.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.526
Daddy, I'm sorry.

21:36.227 --> 21:37.795
Let's go. We'll miss the train.

21:38.462 --> 21:40.030
Let's move, move, move!

21:42.566 --> 21:43.733
What's the matter?

21:45.135 --> 21:46.436
I can't use her.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.105
She's great. Why not?
What's the problem?

21:50.706 --> 21:52.541
You know General Omar Bradley?

21:53.709 --> 21:55.411
There's too strong a resemblance.

21:56.945 --> 21:58.981
You ain't taking her
because she ain't pretty?

21:59.748 --> 22:01.583
Well, look who just caught up!

22:02.250 --> 22:03.685
All right. Come on, let's go.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.588
Pick those suitcases up! Come on!

22:08.322 --> 22:09.690
I'm not kidding. Move!

22:10.257 --> 22:11.826
- One foot in front of the other.
- Mister?

22:18.165 --> 22:20.834
I know my girl ain't so pretty
as these girls.

22:21.935 --> 22:23.303
But that's my fault.

22:24.103 --> 22:25.938
I raised her like I would a boy.

22:26.639 --> 22:27.807
I didn't know any better.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.744
She loves to play.

22:33.946 --> 22:36.548
Don't make my girl suffer
because I messed up raising her.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.417
Please?

22:43.521 --> 22:45.223
I wish you had a decent mitt.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.325
I think maybe I'd better not go.

22:49.026 --> 22:50.594
No, you can relace it.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.062
It'll be okay.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.831
I mean, who's gonna
take care of you? Cook?

22:55.599 --> 22:57.167
Help you take care of the equipment?

22:57.801 --> 22:59.235
Don't you worry about me.

23:00.803 --> 23:01.904
You'll play baseball.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.641
I'm not gonna know anybody.

23:09.178 --> 23:11.079
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.

23:13.815 --> 23:15.984
You gotta go where things happen.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.054
I love you, Daddy.

23:27.127 --> 23:28.562
Let's go, let's go.

23:29.830 --> 23:30.931
Come on, honey.

23:41.307 --> 23:42.241
Are you coming?

23:45.044 --> 23:47.779
See, how it works is, the train moves,
not the station.

23:52.784 --> 23:54.552
This is making me sick.

24:02.226 --> 24:03.527
Write to me, honey.

24:04.962 --> 24:06.163
I love you.

24:35.356 --> 24:37.124
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?

24:37.791 --> 24:38.959
Don't eat it.

24:52.405 --> 24:54.707
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.

24:55.508 --> 24:56.675
Tryouts. Get out there.

24:57.176 --> 24:59.144
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.

24:59.912 --> 25:02.114
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.

25:03.248 --> 25:04.616
Wait. You're going?

25:05.817 --> 25:07.085
Dry your eyes.

25:07.585 --> 25:09.554
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.

25:10.321 --> 25:13.390
Give the wife a pickle-tickle,
and I'm on my way. I'll see you.

25:15.726 --> 25:16.593
- But-
- But what?

25:17.327 --> 25:18.428
Field! Tryouts! Play!

25:19.196 --> 25:20.764
That's it! Get lost!

25:23.733 --> 25:25.935
I hate when they get
attached to me like that.

25:36.612 --> 25:37.546
- Hey, Mae.
- What?

25:38.080 --> 25:40.115
- Come look at this.
- Wait a second, Doris.

25:40.882 --> 25:42.917
I can't wait much longer, so get up.

25:45.086 --> 25:45.953
Yeah, so?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.589
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.

25:50.724 --> 25:52.226
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.

25:52.860 --> 25:55.595
I could do it. How long you been
working on that, Doris?

25:56.530 --> 25:57.397
Took me a year.

25:57.898 --> 26:01.334
Not counting the two months I was in the
hospital. Bat hit me right in the head.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.304
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.

26:06.172 --> 26:09.675
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking, okay? I'm nervous.

26:13.011 --> 26:14.579
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?

26:15.614 --> 26:16.715
Nothing.

26:17.615 --> 26:18.917
That's right, nothing.

26:19.784 --> 26:21.686
All these girls gonna be in the league?

26:23.354 --> 26:24.288
- You wish.
- You do wish.

26:24.722 --> 26:27.258
- Four teams. Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.

26:28.559 --> 26:29.860
Sixty-four girls.

26:30.394 --> 26:31.662
What are you, a genius?

26:32.195 --> 26:35.332
They got over 100 girls here,
so some of youse will have to go home.

26:36.366 --> 26:38.067
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.

26:38.735 --> 26:40.303
What do you mean, "some of us"?

26:45.641 --> 26:47.976
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- How'd you do that?

26:49.411 --> 26:50.645
Excuse me.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.914
You caught that. Hello?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.417
Let's go practice.

26:56.918 --> 26:58.953
She caught it with her bare hand.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.558
And now, from Chicago,
The Mutual presents...

27:05.392 --> 27:08.128
...another social commentary
by Miss Maida Gilespie.

27:09.396 --> 27:10.897
Careers and higher education...

27:11.498 --> 27:13.900
...are leading to
the masculinization of women...

27:14.801 --> 27:16.969
...with enormously dangerous
consequences...

27:17.737 --> 27:20.272
...to the home, the children
and our country.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.075
When our boys come home from war...

27:23.709 --> 27:26.044
...what kind of girls will they
be coming home to?

27:26.812 --> 27:29.948
And now, the most
disgusting example...

27:30.982 --> 27:34.052
...of this sexual confusion,
Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars...

27:35.086 --> 27:38.222
...is presenting us
with women's baseball.

27:39.256 --> 27:42.392
Right here in Chicago, young girls
plucked from their families...

27:43.794 --> 27:45.095
...are gathered at Harvey Field...

27:45.662 --> 27:48.331
...to see which one of them
can be the most masculine.

27:49.232 --> 27:53.002
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars,
you are completely nuts.

28:21.495 --> 28:23.330
Very good. Try another.

28:49.287 --> 28:50.454
Nice throw!

29:14.676 --> 29:17.345
Your name will be on
one of those five lists.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.381
Okay, find your name.

29:23.684 --> 29:26.020
If we could just form
two or three parallel lines...

29:34.127 --> 29:35.962
I'm a Peach!

29:38.798 --> 29:40.166
A Rockford Peach!

29:40.733 --> 29:42.435
I made it! I can stay!

29:44.236 --> 29:47.539
Are you a newspaper guy? This is
my friend Mae. She made the team.

29:50.342 --> 29:53.078
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.

29:53.979 --> 29:55.347
Now, you're the first-

29:59.183 --> 30:02.186
Honey, are you supposed to be here,
or are you on the cut list?

30:04.822 --> 30:06.323
Look, I'm sorry.

30:07.191 --> 30:09.793
If you're on the cut list,
you have to leave the field.

30:10.694 --> 30:11.995
Well, are you cut?

30:13.196 --> 30:16.833
Look on the list. It's either Rockford,
Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.372
Can you read, honey?

30:24.373 --> 30:25.240
No.

30:25.674 --> 30:27.442
All right, what's your name?

30:28.643 --> 30:29.945
Shirley Baker.

30:31.379 --> 30:32.814
Let's just take a look.

30:41.855 --> 30:42.790
This is you.

30:43.257 --> 30:45.292
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.

30:47.894 --> 30:48.828
Go join your team.

30:50.864 --> 30:52.765
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.

30:53.499 --> 30:55.268
First, congratulations.

30:56.168 --> 30:57.870
You are the first members...

30:58.504 --> 31:01.106
...of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League.

31:06.044 --> 31:07.345
I'm Charlie Collins.

31:07.946 --> 31:10.815
I'll be managing the Racine team
when the season starts.

31:11.883 --> 31:13.985
The other teams will have
managers soon.

31:14.919 --> 31:16.620
At the end of practice today...

31:17.288 --> 31:19.690
...you all have to get fitted
for your uniforms.

31:20.557 --> 31:23.894
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.

31:25.862 --> 31:27.430
You can't slide in that.

31:28.064 --> 31:29.065
That's a dress.

31:29.565 --> 31:30.733
It's half a dress.

31:31.267 --> 31:32.435
That's not a baseball uniform.

31:32.935 --> 31:35.471
What do you think we are,
ballplayers or ballerinas?

31:36.705 --> 31:37.806
It's awfully short.

31:38.340 --> 31:41.209
Short? I'm gonna have to squat
in that thing.

31:43.245 --> 31:44.879
I can't!
My husband will kill me.

31:45.513 --> 31:46.181
Ladies!

31:49.417 --> 31:50.084
Excuse me.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.920
You can't play ball in this,
you can't play ball with us.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.424
There are 38 girls getting
tickets home...

31:58.125 --> 32:00.227
...who'll play in a bathing suit
if I ask.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.996
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.

32:04.430 --> 32:05.865
There is no smoking.

32:06.599 --> 32:08.367
There is also no drinking and no men.

32:09.568 --> 32:12.871
Your social engagements will be cleared
through your team chaperones.

32:13.906 --> 32:16.308
You'll have regular classes
at charm and beauty school.

32:17.476 --> 32:18.410
For what?

32:18.910 --> 32:20.679
Every girl in this league
will be a lady.

32:23.548 --> 32:25.950
And gracefully and grandly.

32:27.084 --> 32:29.420
Gracefully and grandly.

32:40.096 --> 32:41.331
All right, now go back!

32:42.131 --> 32:43.566
And sip.

32:44.467 --> 32:45.334
Down.

32:45.835 --> 32:46.836
Don't slurp.

32:47.336 --> 32:48.437
Sip.

32:49.438 --> 32:50.372
Down.

32:50.806 --> 32:51.807
Don't slurp.

32:59.914 --> 33:01.182
Stop that!

33:01.682 --> 33:02.483
It's good.

33:03.618 --> 33:04.852
Posture!

33:06.420 --> 33:07.354
Heads up.

33:08.789 --> 33:09.723
Backs straight.

33:10.257 --> 33:11.825
And sit.

33:15.495 --> 33:17.897
Right over left.
Legs always together.

33:18.731 --> 33:19.832
A lady reveals nothing.

33:25.904 --> 33:28.006
The hair. Soften and shorten.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.310
The eyebrows. Thin and separate.
There should be two.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.448
ery nice.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.584
ery nice!

33:41.152 --> 33:42.253
Lovely!

33:45.489 --> 33:46.657
What do you suggest?

33:47.190 --> 33:49.092
A lot of night games.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.732
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always-

33:57.667 --> 33:59.235
Jimmy, come on.

33:59.835 --> 34:01.470
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?

34:02.137 --> 34:03.705
Place used to be a golf course.

34:04.339 --> 34:06.508
I never cared for the game,
but I love grass.

34:07.309 --> 34:10.178
It costs a fortune,
with the mowing and trimming.

34:11.145 --> 34:14.514
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.

34:15.549 --> 34:17.318
Now look. I got a park.

34:19.687 --> 34:21.788
These are my in-laws. Hello!

34:22.723 --> 34:25.391
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.

34:26.493 --> 34:28.962
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you
another managing job.

34:32.931 --> 34:35.734
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do
a better job than last time.

34:36.668 --> 34:39.271
You kind of let me down
on that San Antonio job.

34:40.172 --> 34:43.241
I had no right to sell off
the team's equipment like that.

34:44.275 --> 34:45.443
It won't happen again.

34:45.944 --> 34:48.612
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.350
Well, that is blunt.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.754
No, sir. I've quit drinking.

34:57.521 --> 34:58.956
You've seen the error of your ways?

34:59.623 --> 35:01.258
No, I just can't afford it.

35:03.460 --> 35:04.260
That's funny to you?

35:05.161 --> 35:06.663
Your drinking is funny?

35:07.330 --> 35:08.631
You're a young man.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.367
You still could be playing...

35:12.034 --> 35:14.837
...if you just would've laid off
the booze.

35:16.738 --> 35:19.474
Well, it's not exactly like that.

35:20.675 --> 35:21.409
I hurt my knee.

35:21.810 --> 35:24.212
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!

35:25.046 --> 35:25.980
There was a fire.

35:26.414 --> 35:28.182
Which you started,
which I paid for.

35:28.883 --> 35:29.884
I was gonna send you...

35:30.384 --> 35:33.454
...a thank-you card, but I wasn't
allowed anything sharp to write with.

35:34.421 --> 35:37.657
I want you to manage
one of the new girls' baseball teams.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.128
Don't look so stunned. Face it.

35:42.929 --> 35:46.432
You're still a name. You step
out of the dugout before every game.

35:47.566 --> 35:48.801
You wave your little hat.

35:49.335 --> 35:50.502
You give the people a thrill.

35:51.003 --> 35:53.305
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.

35:54.106 --> 35:55.740
If your knees are up to it,
go ahead.

35:57.776 --> 35:59.010
Mr. Harvey...

36:01.012 --> 36:02.914
...I hit 487 home runs
for your baseball club.

36:03.581 --> 36:05.549
Three in the World Series,
two in game 4 alone.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.585
I know that.

36:08.085 --> 36:09.853
That's why I'm giving you this job.

36:10.587 --> 36:11.755
Take it or leave it.

36:12.823 --> 36:13.824
I gotta feed the fish.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.197
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game...

36:21.998 --> 36:24.033
...of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League!

36:24.767 --> 36:28.003
The South Bend Blue Sox
against your own Rockford Peaches.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.840
- Where is he?
- I can't believe he's our manager.

36:32.741 --> 36:36.077
I was listening to the radio when he hit
that home run to win the pennant.

36:37.578 --> 36:39.680
I'm asking him to sign
my husband's baseball card.

36:40.414 --> 36:42.450
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?

36:43.184 --> 36:44.551
Just be careful with it.

36:45.085 --> 36:48.288
If anything happens, he'll come back
from the Pacific and kill me.

37:00.066 --> 37:02.601
- Mr. Dugan-
- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...

37:34.297 --> 37:35.598
Do something, Mae.

37:36.632 --> 37:37.366
Time him.

37:38.267 --> 37:39.635
Give me your watch.

37:41.436 --> 37:42.504
Could be a record.

37:48.977 --> 37:50.211
That counts.

37:50.945 --> 37:52.113
How long?

37:53.948 --> 37:55.249
I ain't gonna ask you again.

37:55.816 --> 37:57.651
Shut up, Doris.

38:02.889 --> 38:03.890
Keep timing.

38:10.796 --> 38:11.964
Hey, Mae, how long?

38:13.732 --> 38:15.567
Boy, that was some good peeing.

38:18.503 --> 38:19.438
Hey, coach.

38:19.938 --> 38:23.074
Mr. Dugan? Could you sign
my husband's baseball card for me?

38:27.078 --> 38:28.012
Great to meet you!

38:29.580 --> 38:31.348
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.

38:32.082 --> 38:33.083
We can't play without one.

38:33.751 --> 38:35.519
I'll pitch. I can pitch.

38:39.756 --> 38:41.958
- I thought I was playing centre field.
- No, I am.

38:44.427 --> 38:46.662
Hey, you guys. Come on.

38:47.430 --> 38:49.131
How hard can it be to make a lineup?

38:49.832 --> 38:51.867
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?

38:52.601 --> 38:54.303
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

38:55.971 --> 38:57.806
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.

38:58.506 --> 38:59.307
She's good.

38:59.808 --> 39:01.776
And now, the manager of the Peaches...

39:02.577 --> 39:05.179
...former six-time
National League Home Run Champ...

39:06.180 --> 39:07.882
...Jimmy Dugan!

39:12.686 --> 39:15.222
Jimmy, look up here! We love you!

39:16.523 --> 39:19.659
Bullshit. You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.

39:20.927 --> 39:23.029
Kiss my big hairy ass.

39:25.331 --> 39:27.166
And the Rockford Peaches!

39:28.334 --> 39:30.502
Doris Murphy takes the field!

39:32.971 --> 39:34.406
Lift up your skirt!

39:36.274 --> 39:37.208
This'll be something.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.344
Ain't too many people here.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.512
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.

39:42.046 --> 39:42.913
I ain't.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.553
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.992
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.

39:58.461 --> 40:01.197
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?

40:02.131 --> 40:03.766
All right, ladies, let's play ball!

40:04.466 --> 40:06.435
- Let's play ball.
- Dirt in the skirt!

40:07.636 --> 40:09.805
And now, the lineup for Rockford:

40:10.972 --> 40:14.876
Leading off and playing centre
field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!

40:16.511 --> 40:19.814
Batting second and playing 3rd base,
number 22, Doris Murphy!

40:21.815 --> 40:24.885
Batting third, the catcher,
number 8, Dottie Hinson!

40:26.620 --> 40:29.990
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base,
number 32, Marla Hooch.

40:31.057 --> 40:32.492
Girls can't play ball!

40:33.159 --> 40:34.327
Batting fifth...

40:34.861 --> 40:36.829
Look at me! I'm a ballplayer!

40:46.538 --> 40:48.807
Better look out,
I might break a nail!

40:49.641 --> 40:52.043
- number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.

41:00.551 --> 41:02.252
- It slipped!
- Batting ninth, pitcher...

41:02.919 --> 41:05.789
...number 23, Kit Keller!

41:07.657 --> 41:11.160
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to
Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.030
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.633
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her
the green light on 3 and 0...

41:18.600 --> 41:19.801
...or gives her the take sign.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.638
Game's tied 2-2,
the bottom of the 9th...

41:24.372 --> 41:26.841
...with two runners in scoring position
and only 1 out.

41:27.709 --> 41:29.277
From the belt, here's the delivery.

41:33.514 --> 41:36.183
Oh, baby! She hit the cream cheese
out of that one!

41:39.886 --> 41:42.289
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist,
had her swinging away!

41:43.123 --> 41:44.824
He sure knows his baseball.

41:45.625 --> 41:47.260
Come on, Dottie!

41:47.894 --> 41:48.895
Make me proud!

41:49.362 --> 41:51.664
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson...

41:52.498 --> 41:53.866
...and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.

41:58.370 --> 42:00.405
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen! Dottie!

42:01.206 --> 42:03.408
I couldn't believe you hit it
right out there!

42:07.945 --> 42:09.380
Can we have your autograph?

42:10.014 --> 42:10.948
Can we, Jimmy?

42:11.615 --> 42:12.983
Not today, boys.

42:13.917 --> 42:15.085
Come back next game.

42:23.526 --> 42:24.894
Nice piece of coaching.

42:25.428 --> 42:28.631
Especially in the 5th inning when you
scratched your balls for an hour.

42:29.898 --> 42:32.134
Anything worth doing
is worth doing right.

42:33.702 --> 42:34.369
Yes, indeed.

42:34.736 --> 42:37.405
Until you did that, I couldn't tell
if you were drunk or dead.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.880
It was made very clear to me
what I'm supposed to do here.

42:49.450 --> 42:50.817
I smile...

42:51.818 --> 42:54.621
...wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?

42:56.556 --> 42:58.958
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only-

42:59.826 --> 43:00.960
Ballplayers!

43:01.561 --> 43:03.696
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!

43:04.430 --> 43:07.633
Girls are what you sleep with after
the game, not what you coach during it.

43:13.805 --> 43:16.808
If we paid you more, could you be
just a little more disgusting?

43:17.775 --> 43:19.410
I could certainly use the money.

43:23.581 --> 43:25.916
On the home front...

43:26.750 --> 43:28.585
...they find them everywhere...

43:29.319 --> 43:31.588
...North, East, South and West,
and even Canada.:

43:32.489 --> 43:35.291
Players for the new
All-American Girls' Baseball League.

43:40.463 --> 43:41.764
After a month of play...

43:42.298 --> 43:45.300
...the shine still isn't off
these Diamond Gals.

43:47.102 --> 43:48.603
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says...

43:49.237 --> 43:52.173
..."Legging out a triple is no reason
to let your nose get shiny. "

43:53.107 --> 43:55.643
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.

43:57.411 --> 44:00.481
Helen Haley has not only been on
several championship amateur teams...

44:01.448 --> 44:03.784
...she's also an accomplished
coffeemaker.

44:06.786 --> 44:07.921
With her husband in the Pacific...

44:08.421 --> 44:10.690
...Betty Horn enjoys
cooking spaghetti and knitting.

44:11.457 --> 44:13.726
Her teammates call her
"Betty Spaghetti. "

44:15.361 --> 44:17.963
Ellen Sue Gotlander is
a former Miss Georgia.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.567
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson...

44:23.201 --> 44:24.970
...who plays like Gehrig
and looks like Garbo.

44:25.637 --> 44:28.439
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.

44:30.341 --> 44:33.978
And there's her kid sister Kit,
who's as single as they come.

44:35.146 --> 44:38.782
Enough concentrated "oomph" for
a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.

44:40.517 --> 44:42.419
And how about Marla Hooch?

44:44.187 --> 44:45.388
What a hitter!

44:46.589 --> 44:47.390
What a lead!

44:47.824 --> 44:50.059
But girls playing baseball?

45:07.442 --> 45:08.609
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!

45:09.110 --> 45:11.378
Good. Come back next game, will you?

45:15.782 --> 45:17.417
I'm Evelyn Gardner.

45:20.487 --> 45:22.188
I play right field.

45:24.824 --> 45:25.892
For us.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.799
I just spoke to my husband last night.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.968
He says I can't leave our son
with him at home anymore.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.605
See, he says he's too busy reading
the want ads...

45:43.741 --> 45:47.178
...and I should just take him with me
and shut up about it. So can I?

45:49.346 --> 45:51.482
Take my son with me on road trips?

45:58.755 --> 46:00.189
Ballplayers...!

46:08.697 --> 46:10.866
He's the sweetest little boy.

46:11.633 --> 46:13.602
Everyone's just gonna love him.

46:29.716 --> 46:31.551
Get this brat off of me!

46:37.323 --> 46:38.257
That's it! I quit!

46:38.691 --> 46:40.326
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.

46:41.427 --> 46:43.395
- You're too young to drive.
- I will. Watch.

46:44.430 --> 46:45.731
Evelyn!

46:46.331 --> 46:49.267
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to
kill your son!

46:50.669 --> 46:52.103
Wait! The girls have a game!

46:52.704 --> 46:54.739
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!

46:55.506 --> 46:58.042
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!

46:59.110 --> 47:01.011
You can't catch me!

47:02.246 --> 47:04.281
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!

47:05.048 --> 47:07.517
- Evelyn, why is he so wild?
- I don't know.

47:08.618 --> 47:11.554
Stilwell, angel,
have another chocolate bar.

47:13.089 --> 47:14.023
Gimme! Gimme!

47:14.624 --> 47:17.626
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!

47:18.627 --> 47:20.129
- We can't be here!
- No!

47:24.433 --> 47:25.867
Keep him away from me!

47:26.735 --> 47:28.503
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.

47:29.237 --> 47:32.173
- I hope I have five just like him.
- Don't eat the wrapper, honey.

47:38.879 --> 47:40.447
- You gonna come?
- Where you going?

47:41.882 --> 47:43.917
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.

47:45.018 --> 47:46.386
No, I'm married. I'm...

47:46.953 --> 47:50.156
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.

47:51.791 --> 47:52.592
Girls!

47:53.025 --> 47:53.693
Please!

47:54.093 --> 47:56.829
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.

47:59.932 --> 48:02.067
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?

48:03.068 --> 48:05.036
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.

48:17.581 --> 48:18.815
What is it, baby?

48:36.932 --> 48:38.967
What the hell is going on?!

48:40.402 --> 48:41.336
Why are we stopped?

48:41.803 --> 48:42.604
Lou quit.

48:43.905 --> 48:44.839
Who's Lou?

48:46.340 --> 48:47.642
The driver.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.045
A car could've came by now.

48:52.679 --> 48:54.514
- Get on the bus!
- Was that English?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.652
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.

49:08.060 --> 49:11.430
In the 43 years I've practised medicine,
I never saw a woman throw up that much.

49:12.631 --> 49:14.800
Maybe that's how
she entertains herself, doc.

49:21.339 --> 49:22.707
Hurry! Come on!

49:23.774 --> 49:24.709
Quiet!

49:25.242 --> 49:26.677
Mae, what did you give her?

49:28.412 --> 49:30.113
Who cares? It's working.

49:49.164 --> 49:50.932
I'm going, baby!

49:51.633 --> 49:53.068
Come on, way to go, Mae!

50:03.611 --> 50:04.278
I'm coming in!

50:41.545 --> 50:42.980
Catch me!

50:44.281 --> 50:46.616
Did you see me, Kit? I pretzeled!

50:56.192 --> 50:58.594
- How'd you learn to do that?
- She taught me.

50:59.461 --> 51:02.597
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.

51:03.632 --> 51:05.333
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.

51:58.715 --> 51:59.516
You were great!

52:10.526 --> 52:12.995
- Thanks for the ride, kid.
- What's your rush, dollbody?

52:13.929 --> 52:17.065
What do you say we slip in the back seat
and you make a man out of me?

52:19.768 --> 52:21.536
What do you say I smack you around?

52:22.270 --> 52:23.337
Can't we do both?

52:33.080 --> 52:34.781
No, I'm not hot. It's fine.

52:36.116 --> 52:37.484
It's really cold.

52:38.751 --> 52:40.320
- That's better.
- Where's Kit?

52:40.920 --> 52:43.122
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.

52:43.889 --> 52:46.358
I got my truck parked outside.

52:48.260 --> 52:50.462
Sorry, we gotta go. Come on.
Alice, come on.

52:51.263 --> 52:52.697
We gotta go. We got trouble.

52:53.365 --> 52:56.801
- I knew it. You killed Miss Cuthbert.
- We'll bury her. I know a guy-

52:58.636 --> 53:01.639
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.

53:02.606 --> 53:05.409
Let's make like a bread truck
and haul buns, ladies.

53:07.444 --> 53:09.079
Let's duck out the back door.

53:10.714 --> 53:12.282
Is this all? Marla didn't come?

53:12.949 --> 53:14.050
She came.

53:16.052 --> 53:17.353
Well, where is she?

53:19.488 --> 53:20.356
There.

53:22.258 --> 53:24.460
Thinkin' of you

53:27.095 --> 53:30.165
Some others I've seen

53:35.703 --> 53:36.804
What did you do to her?

53:37.305 --> 53:38.472
We just gave her a dress.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.341
And a lot of liquor!

53:43.944 --> 53:46.113
You guys go ahead. I'll get Marla.

53:50.450 --> 53:51.384
Hurry up, ladies!

53:51.818 --> 53:52.618
Thanks.

53:54.654 --> 53:56.555
Gave me a thrill

53:57.990 --> 53:59.825
With all your faults

54:00.726 --> 54:02.427
I love you still

54:03.328 --> 54:04.896
It had to be you

54:06.431 --> 54:07.866
Wonderful you

54:09.467 --> 54:11.369
It had to be you

54:14.672 --> 54:16.574
It had to be you

54:21.011 --> 54:22.779
It had to be you

54:28.251 --> 54:29.485
Marla, honey? We gotta go.

54:30.753 --> 54:33.122
I'm singing to Nelson! Ain't I, baby?

54:34.156 --> 54:35.257
You sure are.

54:39.928 --> 54:41.563
I could take her home.

54:42.163 --> 54:43.331
It'd be an honour.

54:43.832 --> 54:45.133
Ain't he something?

54:46.034 --> 54:48.202
Could make me be blue

54:58.011 --> 55:00.947
That's the second time he dropped
that Bible since she's been in there.

55:14.660 --> 55:15.827
Come on, girls.

55:16.795 --> 55:17.729
Mae, what'd you say?

55:18.163 --> 55:18.964
Everything.

55:19.464 --> 55:21.232
Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.

55:22.867 --> 55:24.836
Managing girl ballplayers.

55:25.770 --> 55:28.906
You go out there and you wave
your little hat around.

55:30.374 --> 55:31.809
Don't drink!

55:32.643 --> 55:35.645
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!

55:39.482 --> 55:42.418
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.

55:43.386 --> 55:45.921
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."

55:46.856 --> 55:48.957
There, catch that, blondie!

55:52.894 --> 55:54.196
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches...

55:54.796 --> 55:56.431
...number 5, centre fielder...

55:57.365 --> 55:59.267
...Mae Mordabito!

56:02.003 --> 56:03.204
Here's the pitch.

56:04.338 --> 56:05.973
There's a shot into right centre!

56:06.640 --> 56:08.075
It's up the alley!

56:09.176 --> 56:11.278
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!

56:12.312 --> 56:13.580
She's heading past 2nd.

56:15.248 --> 56:16.249
She's heading into 3rd!

56:16.749 --> 56:18.518
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!

56:19.919 --> 56:22.254
- Safe!
- She's in there with a triple!

56:23.122 --> 56:25.524
Boy, did she smack that one
right on the kisser.

56:26.358 --> 56:28.393
No wonder they call her
"All-the-Way" Mae.

56:31.062 --> 56:32.197
Triple.

56:33.198 --> 56:34.065
Next batter...

56:34.566 --> 56:37.802
...number 32, 2nd baseman,
Marla Hooch.

56:40.237 --> 56:43.374
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!

56:54.384 --> 56:55.685
What are you, stupid?

56:56.652 --> 56:59.955
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.

57:01.023 --> 57:03.492
You're gonna squeeze bunt
with our best hitter?

57:04.559 --> 57:06.194
What's the sign to swing away?

57:07.095 --> 57:08.663
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?

57:09.330 --> 57:11.032
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.

57:11.666 --> 57:13.501
Stop thinking with your tits. Batter!

57:15.269 --> 57:15.936
Time!

57:41.426 --> 57:42.094
Come on!

57:43.295 --> 57:45.130
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!

57:45.797 --> 57:47.498
Then act like it, you big lush!

57:48.833 --> 57:51.569
- You tell him, Dottie!
- About time someone told him.

57:55.205 --> 57:56.840
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!

58:05.415 --> 58:07.250
Way to go, whatever your name is!

58:11.287 --> 58:12.588
Good bluff!

58:16.091 --> 58:18.060
But I still say
you're not ballplayers.

58:26.200 --> 58:29.637
Cemetery boneyard! Cross your fingers
or you'll never get another hit.

58:31.405 --> 58:32.506
Sound it out.

58:34.541 --> 58:35.475
Kimono.

58:35.942 --> 58:38.078
Kimono off and...

58:40.046 --> 58:41.047
...gra-bed...

58:41.581 --> 58:42.582
Grabbed.

58:43.249 --> 58:44.050
...her...

58:48.087 --> 58:49.255
...milky...

58:50.889 --> 58:52.124
...milky white...

58:52.624 --> 58:54.192
What are you giving her to read?

58:54.793 --> 58:56.561
What's the difference?
She's reading.

58:57.228 --> 58:58.329
That's the important thing.

58:58.797 --> 58:59.797
Go away! Go! Shoo!

59:00.265 --> 59:01.332
Go ahead, Shirley.

59:01.833 --> 59:02.567
Thanks.

59:05.069 --> 59:06.137
Milky...

59:06.637 --> 59:07.638
...white...

59:12.609 --> 59:13.777
...breasts.

59:16.413 --> 59:18.381
It gets really good after that.

59:19.449 --> 59:21.851
- A delivery boy walks in...
- What are you doing?

59:22.652 --> 59:23.819
I'm writing a song.

59:24.320 --> 59:26.488
Really? What's it about?

59:27.289 --> 59:28.457
About us.

59:29.224 --> 59:30.325
Could you teach it to me?

59:30.792 --> 59:32.494
Doris, is this your boyfriend?

59:35.663 --> 59:36.831
Is it out of focus?

59:37.498 --> 59:38.933
No, that's how he looks.

59:41.836 --> 59:43.671
Looks aren't the most important thing.

59:44.405 --> 59:47.975
Right. The important thing is he's
stupid, out of work and treats me bad.

59:49.409 --> 59:50.610
Then why...?

59:51.278 --> 59:53.179
Why? What do you think? Because...

59:54.113 --> 59:55.748
...none of the other boys ever...

59:57.116 --> 59:59.218
Always made me feel like I was wrong.

01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:03.489
Like I was some sort of a weird girl
or a strange girl...

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.892
...or not even a girl,
just because I could play.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.128
I believed them too. But not anymore.

01:00:10.862 --> 01:00:13.331
I mean, look. There's a lot of us.

01:00:14.165 --> 01:00:15.533
I think we're all all right.

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:18.436
We are.

01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:22.439
Give me that.

01:00:28.178 --> 01:00:29.546
So long, Charlie!

01:00:35.017 --> 01:00:37.887
So with 2 runs in the 6th,
South Bend gets even.

01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:42.557
I've gotta go! I've gotta go!

01:00:43.525 --> 01:00:45.160
You shake it off. Shake it off.

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.765
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?

01:00:54.268 --> 01:00:55.503
Which team do you play for?

01:00:57.705 --> 01:00:59.740
- I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering...

01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:02.943
...because I couldn't figure out why
you'd throw home...

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:05.211
...when we've got a 2-run lead!

01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:08.648
You let the tying run get on 2nd,
and we lost the lead!

01:01:09.615 --> 01:01:10.917
You start using your head!

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.486
That's that lump that's three feet
above your ass!

01:01:23.128 --> 01:01:24.129
Are you crying?

01:01:26.164 --> 01:01:27.031
Are you crying?

01:01:27.498 --> 01:01:28.733
Are you crying?!

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.668
There's no crying!

01:01:31.335 --> 01:01:33.037
There's no crying in baseball!

01:01:33.671 --> 01:01:34.905
Leave her alone, Jimmy.

01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:36.640
You zip it, Doris!

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.410
Rogers Hornsby, my manager,
called me a 'talking pile of pig shit'!

01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:43.313
That was when my parents came
from Michigan...

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.215
...to see me play the game!
And did I cry?

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:49.518
No! Do you know why?

01:01:50.686 --> 01:01:53.689
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!

01:01:54.723 --> 01:01:55.824
No crying!

01:01:56.391 --> 01:01:57.759
What's the matter?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.594
She's crying, sir.

01:02:00.662 --> 01:02:02.497
I didn't mean to do that.

01:02:03.498 --> 01:02:05.266
Perhaps you chastised her
too vehemently.

01:02:05.933 --> 01:02:08.802
Good rule of thumb: Treat each of them
as you would your mother.

01:02:11.505 --> 01:02:14.174
Anyone ever tell you you look like
a penis with a hat on?

01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:16.343
You're out of here!

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:18.244
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.

01:02:18.812 --> 01:02:20.046
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!

01:02:20.546 --> 01:02:23.216
You can't throw me out knowing
you've got a strike!

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.451
Off this field!

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.056
I can't believe no one ever
called you that before!

01:02:31.923 --> 01:02:34.326
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.

01:02:37.262 --> 01:02:39.997
The crowd's light today,
what with the tractor show in town.

01:02:40.932 --> 01:02:44.768
If you're nearby, and you must be, since
this isn't a powerful radio station...

01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:48.539
...come on down to the ballpark
and bring the kiddies.

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:51.775
People better start showing up.

01:02:52.409 --> 01:02:54.310
We don't have fans,
we don't have a league.

01:02:55.044 --> 01:02:56.279
Ladies...

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.748
...you all look wonderful.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:05.154
There's a reporter and a photographer
in the stands from Life magazine.

01:03:06.555 --> 01:03:08.123
- We're famous!
- Life magazine?

01:03:08.724 --> 01:03:10.225
Don't waste your time.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.929
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do
a story about you.

01:03:15.897 --> 01:03:17.331
Me? Why me?

01:03:18.132 --> 01:03:20.501
You're the "Queen of Diamonds."
That's what I'm calling you.

01:03:22.303 --> 01:03:23.670
Did you tell them about me?

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.807
I told them how at first,
the scout didn't even want you...

01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:30.143
...but how Dottie wouldn't come
without her kid sister.

01:03:31.644 --> 01:03:33.146
They really loved it.

01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:36.849
A real human-interest story.

01:03:38.951 --> 01:03:42.254
Will you just try to give them
something spectacular out there?

01:03:43.355 --> 01:03:44.222
Anything.

01:03:44.623 --> 01:03:45.624
What's the matter?

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:50.028
Well, we're not doing so well.

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:54.031
Harvey and the other owners think
they've made a mistake.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.367
They might close you down.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:59.603
What are you talking about?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.838
They can't close us down here.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.574
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:08.111
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.613
And what am I supposed to do?

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.915
Go back to taxi dancing?

01:04:13.582 --> 01:04:16.385
Ten cents so some slob can sweat
gin all over me?

01:04:17.953 --> 01:04:19.388
I'm never doing that again!

01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:24.025
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man
that he ain't closing me down!

01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:26.861
They can't keep us from playing!

01:04:27.462 --> 01:04:29.030
We'll show them how we play.

01:04:30.398 --> 01:04:33.634
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:37.571
So will you just give them
everything you've got?

01:04:38.438 --> 01:04:39.706
We always do.

01:04:44.677 --> 01:04:47.213
A slick play by Alice Gaspers
and there's 2 gone...

01:04:48.114 --> 01:04:50.249
...in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.

01:04:53.819 --> 01:04:56.755
Lynch is the most consistent
Belles hitter this year.

01:04:58.356 --> 01:04:59.658
Settles in.

01:05:02.193 --> 01:05:03.695
Pops it up! Foul.

01:05:04.329 --> 01:05:06.097
Hinson should have
no trouble with this.

01:05:06.764 --> 01:05:07.565
She's under it.

01:05:08.933 --> 01:05:10.034
Uncle Elmore's socks!

01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.269
What did she do?

01:05:15.772 --> 01:05:16.873
I can't do that.

01:05:17.407 --> 01:05:18.208
Who can?

01:05:18.642 --> 01:05:21.177
- What is her name?
- Dottie Hinson. D-O-T-T-I-E...

01:05:22.979 --> 01:05:24.347
What the hell was that?

01:05:24.947 --> 01:05:26.849
I just thought it might
help the league.

01:05:27.616 --> 01:05:29.451
A goddamn circus!

01:05:30.119 --> 01:05:31.553
A double would be nice-

01:05:32.154 --> 01:05:33.455
All right!

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:36.424
God knows we have a game.

01:05:38.259 --> 01:05:40.528
It's not like any of this helps,
believe me.

01:05:52.305 --> 01:05:53.240
That was really nice!

01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:57.510
Let's go, girls. Dozens of people are
waiting for the game to start.

01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:26.303
Batter!

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.808
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:33.343
Beverly!

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:35.712
Look sharp, tall-
What is her name?

01:06:36.379 --> 01:06:37.680
Beverly. Good.

01:06:42.484 --> 01:06:43.852
Five bucks! Five bucks!

01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:53.294
What if, at a key moment in the game,
my uniform bursts open...

01:06:54.495 --> 01:06:55.863
...and my bosoms fly out?

01:06:56.497 --> 01:06:58.699
That might draw a crowd, right?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.969
Think there's men
who ain't seen your bosoms?

01:07:02.703 --> 01:07:03.804
Thank you.

01:07:05.005 --> 01:07:06.973
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:09.476
I got a letter from Nelson!

01:07:13.045 --> 01:07:14.680
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings...

01:07:15.314 --> 01:07:17.149
...the crowd to its feet
with a home run!

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:21.453
22!

01:07:27.492 --> 01:07:29.127
We love you, 22!

01:07:29.761 --> 01:07:31.529
- Come on!
- Open your mouth!

01:07:33.331 --> 01:07:34.498
The kid ate the lineup!

01:07:37.434 --> 01:07:38.102
Right here.

01:07:56.418 --> 01:07:58.387
I'm so happy! Thank you.

01:08:04.192 --> 01:08:04.993
I love you.

01:08:06.594 --> 01:08:07.962
I'll be back next season.

01:08:08.563 --> 01:08:09.997
See you next season!

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.371
Slide! Slide!

01:08:19.406 --> 01:08:20.206
Safe!

01:08:20.774 --> 01:08:21.573
Thank you!

01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:23.276
Let it up. Let it up.

01:08:25.711 --> 01:08:26.712
That was a good one.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.482
It's a fly ball to left!

01:08:30.849 --> 01:08:33.185
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!

01:08:34.353 --> 01:08:37.087
Heads up! Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!

01:08:39.858 --> 01:08:41.826
Aunt Edna's bridgework! She is out!

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.895
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:47.031
Oh, doctor!

01:08:50.234 --> 01:08:51.734
A lot of ballplayers use it.

01:09:05.648 --> 01:09:06.948
High foul pop.

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:08.584
It's coming back!

01:09:10.953 --> 01:09:12.520
She caught it! Unbelievable!

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.357
Full house on its feet
cheering Dottie Hinson!

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:23.898
That sounded good.

01:09:24.665 --> 01:09:26.800
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?!

01:09:27.568 --> 01:09:28.935
You haven't had one since-

01:09:55.159 --> 01:09:56.160
Safe!

01:09:57.094 --> 01:09:57.828
Safe!

01:10:29.157 --> 01:10:29.958
He's good-looking.

01:10:31.793 --> 01:10:34.462
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.

01:10:35.363 --> 01:10:36.730
He'll be manager. He's smart.

01:10:38.265 --> 01:10:40.100
So he's good-looking and smart.

01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:42.135
There's so few of us.

01:10:44.204 --> 01:10:45.972
Where did you say he was? Italy?

01:10:46.639 --> 01:10:49.776
I think. I haven't got a letter
from him in three weeks.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.245
I used to get one every week.

01:10:54.413 --> 01:10:55.981
That doesn't mean anything.

01:10:57.649 --> 01:11:01.286
If he's in combat, it's not like there's
a mailbox on every corner.

01:11:02.921 --> 01:11:05.523
If something happened,
you would've got a telegram.

01:11:06.457 --> 01:11:07.191
Oh, God, don't-

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:09.961
But he's fine. No, he's fine.

01:11:13.797 --> 01:11:15.232
How come you're not in the Army?

01:11:17.467 --> 01:11:18.468
I have no cartilage...

01:11:19.503 --> 01:11:20.570
...in my knee.

01:11:21.037 --> 01:11:22.605
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:25.942
You need this, right? Trigger finger.
I could do that.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.415
How did I get so useless so fast?

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.655
Boys like this on your fingers?

01:11:41.289 --> 01:11:42.357
Works for me.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.695
Your sister's not gonna be mad?

01:11:48.362 --> 01:11:49.597
I don't care.

01:11:51.298 --> 01:11:52.466
Listen, when...

01:11:53.634 --> 01:11:55.268
- Bob.
- ... Bob comes back...

01:11:56.536 --> 01:11:57.971
...will you keep playing?

01:12:00.039 --> 01:12:01.040
You could just quit?

01:12:01.507 --> 01:12:02.442
Sure.

01:12:03.342 --> 01:12:04.477
You play like you love it.

01:12:09.148 --> 01:12:11.116
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.218
No, Hitler. Yes, Bob.

01:12:14.419 --> 01:12:15.420
How good am I?

01:12:19.424 --> 01:12:20.591
You stink.

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:22.693
You're lousy.

01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:27.298
You're only the best player
in the league. You don't know that?

01:12:30.534 --> 01:12:31.768
You ever been married?

01:12:34.371 --> 01:12:35.872
Let me think. Yeah, twice.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.007
Any children?

01:12:39.242 --> 01:12:40.510
One of them was.

01:12:43.712 --> 01:12:45.147
Is she out?

01:12:46.749 --> 01:12:48.717
I think it's time for a drink.

01:12:50.318 --> 01:12:51.953
Hang on. Hang on.

01:12:54.689 --> 01:12:56.124
These really don't mix.

01:13:10.403 --> 01:13:12.439
- Good, huh?
- Oh, yeah. It's great.

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:20.546
Fair ball!

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.454
Time!

01:13:29.888 --> 01:13:32.023
Jimmy Dugan pops his head
out of the dugout.

01:13:32.757 --> 01:13:34.926
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.

01:13:36.227 --> 01:13:38.329
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.

01:13:40.097 --> 01:13:41.398
Game's getting exciting.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.601
I'll finish it right here.

01:13:45.135 --> 01:13:46.569
I'll strike this turkey out.

01:13:48.104 --> 01:13:49.472
Betty's ready to come in.

01:13:50.073 --> 01:13:52.041
Come on. I've never been
taken out before.

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:53.542
Ask Dottie.

01:13:54.877 --> 01:13:56.579
I really wanna finish this game.

01:13:57.613 --> 01:13:58.480
Please?

01:14:02.084 --> 01:14:02.818
What do you think?

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:07.188
Well, you know, she's battling.

01:14:09.057 --> 01:14:09.991
What do you think?

01:14:12.193 --> 01:14:13.627
She's throwing grapefruits.

01:14:18.131 --> 01:14:21.902
It looks like Keller's coming out of
the game, and she is not happy about it!

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:24.938
Nice job, Kit!

01:14:26.039 --> 01:14:29.108
Betty Horn sprints in
from the left-field bullpen.

01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:35.047
Look at this crowd. This is great!
They're jumping, cheering...

01:14:36.081 --> 01:14:37.349
...and they paid to get in.

01:14:37.883 --> 01:14:40.085
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.

01:14:40.885 --> 01:14:44.122
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.

01:14:45.323 --> 01:14:48.826
But to be perfectly honest, I think
the girls deserve most of the credit.

01:14:49.994 --> 01:14:50.794
They're great.

01:14:51.228 --> 01:14:54.031
Fortunately, we won't need
them anymore. Do you want a peanut?

01:14:54.965 --> 01:14:56.266
No. What do you mean?

01:14:57.767 --> 01:14:59.069
What do I mean?

01:14:59.636 --> 01:15:02.105
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.

01:15:02.939 --> 01:15:06.375
Roosevelt himself said,
"Men's baseball won't be shut down."

01:15:07.443 --> 01:15:09.478
So we won't need the girls next year.

01:15:12.748 --> 01:15:15.750
Bases loaded. Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2. Two men out.

01:15:16.718 --> 01:15:18.553
No balls, 2 strikes.

01:15:20.088 --> 01:15:21.789
Strike 3!

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:26.660
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:33.033
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.

01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:35.035
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:36.569 --> 01:15:38.771
Look at me. I'm full of peanuts!

01:15:39.572 --> 01:15:41.474
I've got peanuts all over myself.

01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:44.610
This is what it's gonna be like
in the factories too.

01:15:46.078 --> 01:15:47.713
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."

01:15:48.847 --> 01:15:51.583
First, it was their patriotic duty
to get out and go to work.

01:15:52.484 --> 01:15:54.953
When the men come back,
they're sent back to the kitchen.

01:15:56.588 --> 01:16:00.291
Should we send the boys returning
from war back to the kitchen? Come on.

01:16:04.194 --> 01:16:06.864
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?

01:16:07.798 --> 01:16:09.966
They play with sprained ankles,
broken fingers.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.436
They ride a bus all night to play
a double-header the next day!

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:16.305
I'll make it up to them.

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.140
What? With Harvey Bars?

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:20.776
I'm getting tired of listening
to you, Ira.

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:26.014
I'd like your permission
to take over the league.

01:16:28.049 --> 01:16:30.251
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.

01:16:31.052 --> 01:16:32.687
There's no point to it anymore.

01:16:33.321 --> 01:16:35.590
Just let them finish the season,
and that's it!

01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:39.727
I sold your product when there was
no product. This is a product!

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:44.765
There is no room for girls' baseball
in this country...

01:16:45.665 --> 01:16:47.434
...once the war is over.

01:16:48.535 --> 01:16:49.269
They're through.

01:16:50.803 --> 01:16:52.238
I think you're wrong.

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:55.775
And I'm gonna prove it to you,
Mr. Harvey!

01:16:57.343 --> 01:17:00.546
Hi, my name's Mae. That's more
than a name, that's an attitude.

01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:05.016
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.

01:17:06.351 --> 01:17:07.986
- Thank you.
- You're the best.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.189
- The game put us in the playoffs.
- I could've finished.

01:17:12.023 --> 01:17:13.524
Stilwell could've hit off you.

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:17.795
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.035
Don't start with me, Kit!

01:17:25.568 --> 01:17:27.070
Don't you start with me!

01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:28.905
Kit, come on, cut it out!

01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:35.044
What the hell are you doing?!

01:17:44.886 --> 01:17:47.155
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it!

01:17:55.028 --> 01:17:56.730
You just wait, Doris!

01:17:57.664 --> 01:17:59.166
Let me down!

01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:03.570
Let me down!

01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:11.377
You stay down there and you cool off!

01:18:16.915 --> 01:18:19.451
- Why'd she do it?
- She was vulnerable. You provoked her.

01:18:20.351 --> 01:18:22.587
- Shut up, Helen!
- You're making her more upset.

01:18:23.354 --> 01:18:24.222
Really!

01:18:24.689 --> 01:18:26.590
- I don't need it from Helen.
- Take a shower.

01:18:27.324 --> 01:18:30.961
- I'm not taking a shower.
- She reminds me of my husband.

01:18:35.899 --> 01:18:38.001
Save some hot water for me, you guys.

01:18:38.768 --> 01:18:39.702
You okay?

01:18:41.604 --> 01:18:43.439
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.

01:18:44.106 --> 01:18:45.241
You acted like a baby.

01:18:46.742 --> 01:18:47.843
You treat me like one.

01:18:48.744 --> 01:18:50.879
I treated you like a pitcher
who'd lost her stuff.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.883
When Betty's in trouble,
you back her up every pitch!

01:18:56.017 --> 01:18:59.320
I seem to remember last week, somebody
throwing a resin bag in my face.

01:19:00.388 --> 01:19:03.391
Told me to get my fat ass behind
the plate. Was that you or the umpire?

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:05.960
You could've backed me up today...

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.395
...instead of holding me back.

01:19:09.062 --> 01:19:10.130
I hold you back?

01:19:14.868 --> 01:19:16.102
It's like at home.

01:19:16.636 --> 01:19:18.905
It's like if you're here,
then I'm not here.

01:19:20.106 --> 01:19:20.906
What's that mean?

01:19:22.408 --> 01:19:25.010
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.

01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:28.714
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that. I just-

01:19:32.283 --> 01:19:33.985
I just get so mad!

01:19:35.753 --> 01:19:37.188
Why do you gotta be so good?

01:19:53.202 --> 01:19:55.505
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.

01:19:56.272 --> 01:19:57.540
Can I speak to you a minute?

01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:02.311
I have to leave.

01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:05.280
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.

01:20:06.281 --> 01:20:07.649
I'm leaving the team.

01:20:09.117 --> 01:20:09.984
What?

01:20:10.451 --> 01:20:12.086
- Why? What-
- I have to go home.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.922
Home? You can't go home now.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:17.625
This couldn't come at a worse time.

01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:21.728
We're in a bit of a crisis,
and I have to try to pull something off.

01:20:22.796 --> 01:20:24.998
It's not a good time to lose
our most popular player.

01:20:25.799 --> 01:20:28.935
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:20:30.136 --> 01:20:31.270
It's personal?

01:20:34.774 --> 01:20:36.141
It's one of the girls, isn't it?

01:20:36.675 --> 01:20:37.910
It's Mae, right?

01:20:40.479 --> 01:20:42.881
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.

01:20:43.682 --> 01:20:46.618
That's fine. No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.

01:20:47.652 --> 01:20:48.886
I can arrange a trade.

01:20:49.454 --> 01:20:51.289
Racine? Kenosha? South Bend?

01:20:52.656 --> 01:20:53.657
Trade me or whatever.

01:20:54.124 --> 01:20:56.460
But figure it out by tomorrow,
or I'm going home.

01:20:57.694 --> 01:21:00.997
Tomorrow? Fine! I'll work
everything out by tomorrow.

01:21:02.032 --> 01:21:04.000
You really gave me a scare
for a second.

01:21:06.269 --> 01:21:08.304
Does anybody have any extra hose?

01:21:09.138 --> 01:21:10.906
Does anybody have any extra hose?

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.075
Mae, your date's here.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.211
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?

01:21:16.979 --> 01:21:18.880
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit. Too tight.

01:21:19.614 --> 01:21:21.783
I don't plan on wearing it that long.

01:21:22.517 --> 01:21:24.786
I don't know why
you get dressed at all.

01:21:28.356 --> 01:21:29.457
Where's Dottie?

01:21:30.124 --> 01:21:30.991
In there.

01:21:31.792 --> 01:21:33.360
Wanna go to the movies with me?

01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:36.730
You bitch!

01:21:37.964 --> 01:21:39.666
I've been traded to Racine!

01:21:41.801 --> 01:21:42.535
You?

01:21:42.969 --> 01:21:44.670
I told them to trade me.

01:21:45.338 --> 01:21:47.873
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.

01:21:48.807 --> 01:21:50.109
You knew what would happen!

01:21:50.843 --> 01:21:53.312
- I didn't!
- This'll be better than the movies.

01:21:54.446 --> 01:21:57.749
- I'll quit. Is that what you want?
- They'll blame me for you quitting!

01:21:58.783 --> 01:21:59.918
What do you want me to do?

01:22:00.551 --> 01:22:03.487
Stay away from me. Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!

01:22:04.722 --> 01:22:05.456
Kit, listen.

01:22:05.856 --> 01:22:07.691
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.

01:22:08.359 --> 01:22:10.127
- I was getting too good.
- You won't listen.

01:22:10.794 --> 01:22:13.730
I knew if I did too good,
you'd do something to push me down!

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:24.206
Kit, blow it out your rear end!

01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:26.442
I'm sick of you blaming me.

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.377
I got you into this league!

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:29.978
She got her in the league!

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:33.048
- I didn't wanna be here!
- Then why are you still here?

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:39.587
Kit wants to know why
she's playing.

01:22:41.722 --> 01:22:43.824
My train leaves at 8.
I got 10 minutes to pack.

01:22:45.692 --> 01:22:47.327
If you have trouble,
you know who to blame.

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:49.162
See you in the World Series.

01:22:49.663 --> 01:22:50.797
You bet you will.

01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:52.766
Don't look at her.

01:22:55.835 --> 01:22:58.504
Has anyone seen my new red hat?

01:22:59.905 --> 01:23:01.473
Piss on your hat!

01:23:02.141 --> 01:23:03.776
Well, that seemed uncalled for.

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.478
Just keep it down.

01:23:06.978 --> 01:23:08.079
- Kit's off our team.
- She's not!

01:23:08.647 --> 01:23:09.814
Yes, she is. Are you deaf?

01:23:13.251 --> 01:23:15.019
You need any help in there?

01:23:16.053 --> 01:23:17.755
Don't act like this.

01:23:18.522 --> 01:23:19.790
You're still in the league.

01:23:20.324 --> 01:23:22.993
You're just on another team,
that's all.

01:23:29.399 --> 01:23:31.100
Batter up

01:23:32.035 --> 01:23:34.070
Hear that call

01:23:35.371 --> 01:23:37.273
The time has come

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.542
For one and all

01:23:41.443 --> 01:23:44.179
To play

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.581
Ball

01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:49.484
For we're the members of

01:23:50.251 --> 01:23:52.787
The All-American League
We come from cities

01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:54.989
Near and far

01:23:55.623 --> 01:23:57.524
We got Canadians

01:23:58.225 --> 01:23:59.459
Irish ones and Swedes

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.996
We're all for one, we're one for all
We're All-Americans

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:07.100
Each girl stands
Her head so proudly high

01:24:08.101 --> 01:24:09.368
Her motto.: Do or Die

01:24:09.936 --> 01:24:13.572
She's not the one to use
Or need an alibi

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.976
Our chaperones are not too soft
They're not too tough

01:24:19.444 --> 01:24:21.846
Our managers are on the ball

01:24:24.115 --> 01:24:25.049
Miss Cuthbert...

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:28.019
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!

01:24:30.087 --> 01:24:31.455
Man on the floor!

01:24:32.456 --> 01:24:33.891
Already dressed.

01:24:35.392 --> 01:24:37.594
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.

01:24:38.395 --> 01:24:39.629
Get him away from the tapes!

01:24:40.196 --> 01:24:41.631
Angel, come here now.

01:24:42.465 --> 01:24:43.399
All right.

01:24:45.134 --> 01:24:46.569
Everybody, let's listen up.

01:24:47.236 --> 01:24:50.372
I was in the toilet reading my contract,
and it turns out I get a bonus...

01:24:51.373 --> 01:24:53.275
...when we get to the World Series.

01:24:53.976 --> 01:24:56.111
Let's play hard! Play smart!
Use your heads!

01:24:56.878 --> 01:24:59.347
That's that lump three feet
above our ass, right?

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.318
Some more prominent than others.

01:25:04.986 --> 01:25:06.053
Come in.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.291
Excuse me!

01:25:11.892 --> 01:25:13.860
I got a telegram
from the War Department.

01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:15.795
Oh, my God! Ernie!

01:25:17.997 --> 01:25:20.600
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.

01:25:22.568 --> 01:25:25.805
The Army could at least send someone
to tell you your husband's dead.

01:25:28.273 --> 01:25:30.042
Darn! I had the name right here!

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.546
I gotta go back
and straighten this out.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.214
Sorry.

01:25:36.948 --> 01:25:40.318
- Just give me the telegram.
- I can't. I don't have a name.

01:25:41.419 --> 01:25:42.720
Just give me the telegram.

01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:45.689
This is official.
This is from the War Department!

01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:47.224
Come on!

01:25:47.658 --> 01:25:49.026
That's official business!

01:25:49.593 --> 01:25:50.594
I'm coming-

01:26:27.928 --> 01:26:30.330
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- No, it's George!

01:26:49.614 --> 01:26:51.049
It's George!

01:27:06.796 --> 01:27:07.897
All right, come on.

01:27:08.798 --> 01:27:10.366
We still got a game to play.

01:27:43.563 --> 01:27:44.564
Come in.

01:27:54.173 --> 01:27:55.340
Hi, cutie.

01:28:03.181 --> 01:28:04.282
How did you...?

01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:07.685
Bob! Oh, my God!

01:28:09.186 --> 01:28:09.920
What happened?

01:28:11.388 --> 01:28:13.157
- I'm fine.
- What is it?

01:28:13.857 --> 01:28:15.359
It was a sniper.

01:28:15.992 --> 01:28:17.093
I was lucky though.

01:28:17.561 --> 01:28:18.995
He got seven of us before we got him.

01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:22.799
Oh, sweetie!

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.204
It's all right. I made it.

01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:29.938
I missed you so much.

01:28:30.506 --> 01:28:31.740
I've been discharged.

01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:34.176
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:37.412
It's all over. I'm here, baby.

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:40.915
Well, listen.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.984
You have to sit down here.

01:28:44.418 --> 01:28:45.853
I'll clear all this stuff off.

01:28:49.056 --> 01:28:50.691
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.

01:28:51.825 --> 01:28:54.294
- Oh, no. I look terrible!
- You look beautiful.

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:59.832
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:29:09.341 --> 01:29:10.409
I love you.

01:29:15.513 --> 01:29:18.116
Can we just hold each other
for the rest of our lives?

01:29:21.285 --> 01:29:22.586
That's my plan.

01:29:36.432 --> 01:29:39.035
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?

01:29:40.769 --> 01:29:43.238
Are you physically unable
to show up on time?

01:29:44.072 --> 01:29:45.007
Coming, Jimmy.

01:29:46.108 --> 01:29:48.977
If you think you can do without
the batting practice, think again.

01:29:49.911 --> 01:29:51.079
Not the way you hit.

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.816
Let's not go to the World Series
without Stilwell's toys!

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:59.053
- Alice, what time is it where you live?
- It's bad luck to yell before a game.

01:30:03.223 --> 01:30:05.258
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.

01:30:10.029 --> 01:30:12.198
"Avoid the clap. Jimmy Dugan. "

01:30:16.402 --> 01:30:17.903
That's good advice!

01:30:21.573 --> 01:30:23.275
Write to us. We'll miss you.

01:30:23.975 --> 01:30:25.243
We will. Thanks.

01:30:25.777 --> 01:30:27.278
Good luck in the World Series.

01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:43.493
Taking a little day trip?

01:30:45.462 --> 01:30:46.396
Bob and I are...

01:30:46.896 --> 01:30:47.997
...driving home...

01:30:48.598 --> 01:30:49.599
...to Oregon.

01:30:57.072 --> 01:30:58.707
I thought you were a ballplayer.

01:31:00.442 --> 01:31:01.309
You were wrong.

01:31:01.743 --> 01:31:02.477
Was I?

01:31:04.646 --> 01:31:06.280
It is only a game.

01:31:07.181 --> 01:31:09.150
It's only a game,
and I don't need this.

01:31:09.917 --> 01:31:11.485
I have Bob. I don't need this.

01:31:14.955 --> 01:31:18.458
I gave away five years at the end
of my career to drinking.

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.428
Five years.

01:31:22.162 --> 01:31:25.431
There isn't anything I wouldn't give
to get back any one day of it.

01:31:28.501 --> 01:31:29.802
Well, we're different.

01:31:34.773 --> 01:31:37.509
Chickenshit! You wanna go home
and make 100 babies, great.

01:31:38.443 --> 01:31:39.878
I can't tell anyone how to live.

01:31:40.478 --> 01:31:42.780
But sneaking out like this,
quitting...

01:31:43.815 --> 01:31:45.449
You'll regret it all your life.

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.585
Baseball is what gets inside you.

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:50.921
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.

01:31:51.989 --> 01:31:53.757
It just got too hard.

01:31:57.093 --> 01:31:58.528
It's supposed to be hard.

01:31:59.429 --> 01:32:01.330
If it wasn't hard,
everyone would do it.

01:32:02.465 --> 01:32:04.567
The hard is what makes it great.

01:32:15.844 --> 01:32:17.078
Everything all right?

01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:20.481
Yeah, fine. Fine.

01:32:21.949 --> 01:32:23.050
Bye, Jimmy.

01:32:44.536 --> 01:32:47.005
First game of the first
women's baseball World Series.

01:32:47.839 --> 01:32:50.442
This is history in the making.
History in the making!

01:32:58.482 --> 01:32:59.717
This is for you.

01:33:00.484 --> 01:33:01.785
We brought you these also.

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:03.487
For me?

01:33:03.954 --> 01:33:04.621
Thank them!

01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:26.741
- Cut it out!
- I'm sorry.

01:33:47.694 --> 01:33:50.029
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.

01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:52.598
I got two box seats. Who wants them?

01:33:53.232 --> 01:33:54.300
- How much?
-10 bucks.

01:33:54.833 --> 01:33:57.569
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman,
Doris Murphy. Best one they got.

01:33:58.503 --> 01:34:00.205
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.

01:34:00.839 --> 01:34:03.308
After the game,
I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.

01:34:04.609 --> 01:34:06.711
All right, all right, all right!

01:34:07.912 --> 01:34:09.347
Time for the song and dance.

01:34:09.914 --> 01:34:10.648
What's that smell?

01:34:11.082 --> 01:34:12.783
Alice thinks it's bad luck
to change her socks.

01:34:13.484 --> 01:34:15.185
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.

01:34:15.853 --> 01:34:19.623
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long. Alice?

01:34:20.857 --> 01:34:24.060
If the lead-off hitter gets on,
they're gonna bunt. Be ready.

01:34:25.595 --> 01:34:27.630
Now, I'd like to...

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.534
I'd like to lead you in prayer.

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:33.969
- Come on.
- A prayer?

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:35.737
Come on.

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.874
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on! Come on!

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.844
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost...

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:48.883
Lord...

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.685
...hallowed be Thy name.

01:34:54.354 --> 01:34:55.856
May our feet be swift.

01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:58.358
May our bats be mighty.

01:34:59.626 --> 01:35:01.260
May our balls...

01:35:02.128 --> 01:35:03.129
...be plentiful.

01:35:04.597 --> 01:35:05.598
And, Lord...

01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:09.535
...I'd just like to thank you
for that waitress in South Bend.

01:35:10.869 --> 01:35:13.205
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.

01:35:14.406 --> 01:35:15.340
And, God...

01:35:17.208 --> 01:35:19.310
...these are good girls,
and they work hard.

01:35:21.112 --> 01:35:23.914
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.

01:35:24.915 --> 01:35:26.216
- Let's go.
- Amen.

01:35:30.153 --> 01:35:31.221
Go...

01:35:32.155 --> 01:35:33.223
...Peaches!

01:35:36.392 --> 01:35:38.561
Last game. Now or never, ladies.

01:35:43.599 --> 01:35:46.201
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!

01:35:47.236 --> 01:35:49.137
You're goddamn killing me!

01:35:55.076 --> 01:35:57.678
And the rocket's red glare

01:35:58.546 --> 01:36:01.081
The bombs bursting in air

01:36:02.249 --> 01:36:04.651
Gave proof through the night

01:36:05.786 --> 01:36:08.121
That our flag was still there

01:36:09.556 --> 01:36:12.692
Oh, say does that star-spangled

01:36:13.793 --> 01:36:16.262
Banner yet wave

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:22.401
O'er the land of the free

01:36:23.635 --> 01:36:27.672
And the home of the brave

01:36:32.343 --> 01:36:35.212
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.

01:36:36.247 --> 01:36:37.448
There is no tomorrow.

01:36:37.948 --> 01:36:41.785
Someone will walk out league champions,
and someone else will just walk out.

01:36:42.986 --> 01:36:44.554
You're gonna lose!

01:36:45.488 --> 01:36:47.190
You're gonna lose!

01:36:51.861 --> 01:36:54.130
You keep that kid away from me
for just one game!

01:36:55.664 --> 01:36:56.966
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?

01:36:57.499 --> 01:36:59.134
- Good.
- Feeling good? Looking good!

01:36:59.768 --> 01:37:00.702
Nice and warm?

01:37:01.136 --> 01:37:04.139
Good. Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have
anything, don't keep it a secret.

01:37:05.173 --> 01:37:06.741
Tell me right away.

01:37:07.408 --> 01:37:08.476
You understand me?

01:37:08.976 --> 01:37:10.144
Do you hear me?!

01:37:10.778 --> 01:37:12.213
You're screaming. I hear you.

01:37:15.482 --> 01:37:16.483
Where'd you come from?

01:37:17.951 --> 01:37:19.786
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.

01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:25.625
Have trouble with the bears, did you?

01:37:26.459 --> 01:37:29.395
I was fine until that scout walked
into our barn. I'm no quitter.

01:37:30.363 --> 01:37:32.831
Wait a minute! Hold it!
Who said you could play?

01:37:37.002 --> 01:37:38.970
Alice has been catching
the last six games.

01:37:41.373 --> 01:37:42.874
She looks pretty good.

01:37:44.842 --> 01:37:45.977
You don't want me to play?

01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:49.046
Well, you're already dressed.

01:37:50.381 --> 01:37:52.516
Hell, if you want to play...

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:54.952
...I don't care.

01:37:55.686 --> 01:37:56.953
You can play.

01:37:58.388 --> 01:37:59.656
Well, then, I'll play.

01:38:02.358 --> 01:38:03.159
Good.

01:38:03.559 --> 01:38:05.127
- Fine.
- Fine. Go play.

01:38:10.799 --> 01:38:12.834
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?

01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:19.140
We're gonna win.

01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:22.009
We're gonna win!

01:38:24.312 --> 01:38:25.546
You're gonna lose!

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.648
You stink!

01:38:34.888 --> 01:38:35.989
Got him!

01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:38.725
Lineup change!

01:38:39.225 --> 01:38:41.260
- It's okay.
- Evelyn, he deserved it.

01:38:42.828 --> 01:38:45.698
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here
or come in the dugout?

01:38:50.469 --> 01:38:51.269
Strike!

01:38:51.703 --> 01:38:52.370
Strike!

01:38:59.977 --> 01:39:00.778
You're out!

01:39:05.582 --> 01:39:06.517
3!

01:39:08.085 --> 01:39:08.885
Strike!

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:12.555
You're out!

01:39:12.922 --> 01:39:13.590
You're out!

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:16.025
You're out, Brenda! You are out!

01:39:18.394 --> 01:39:19.762
Go! Go! Go!

01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:30.472
Good, Mae! Good catch!
Thank goodness.

01:39:32.574 --> 01:39:34.075
2 down! 2 down!

01:39:39.413 --> 01:39:41.315
Base hit. Gardner's up with it.

01:39:42.049 --> 01:39:43.817
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.

01:39:44.451 --> 01:39:45.819
Gardner's throw is way off line!

01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:51.557
Go! Go! All the way!

01:39:52.258 --> 01:39:53.759
I'm sorry! Shoot!

01:39:54.393 --> 01:39:58.230
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles
take the lead, 1 to nothing!

01:39:59.431 --> 01:40:01.533
They're dancing in the aisles
here in Racine!

01:40:22.853 --> 01:40:24.421
I know. I know.

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.895
You're still missing the cutoff man.

01:40:33.529 --> 01:40:35.798
That's something I would like
you to work on...

01:40:36.598 --> 01:40:37.833
...before next season.

01:40:44.472 --> 01:40:45.974
All right. Thanks.

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:49.277
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.

01:41:00.787 --> 01:41:02.422
All right, let's get this one!

01:41:05.091 --> 01:41:07.693
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.

01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:10.129
Make something happen, Mae!

01:41:11.497 --> 01:41:13.065
All-the-Way Mae!

01:41:13.966 --> 01:41:16.768
- They love her.
- Let's go, let's go!

01:41:19.504 --> 01:41:20.672
Very cute. Thanks.

01:41:32.449 --> 01:41:33.183
Safe!

01:41:33.617 --> 01:41:34.551
She's safe!

01:41:36.786 --> 01:41:39.522
Way to play! Way to run!
Way to make something happen!

01:41:44.393 --> 01:41:45.061
Safe!

01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:58.906
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit
that little porker! Come on!

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:06.647
You're out!

01:42:11.785 --> 01:42:13.687
Come on! Bring me home, Helen!

01:42:24.096 --> 01:42:25.030
Out!

01:42:28.266 --> 01:42:29.901
Peaches are down to their final out.

01:42:30.802 --> 01:42:33.605
Only tying and go-ahead runs
in scoring position.

01:42:34.539 --> 01:42:36.574
Big Dottie Hinson striding
to the plate.

01:42:37.341 --> 01:42:40.010
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!

01:42:56.025 --> 01:42:57.727
Throw smoke, Kit! Throw smoke!

01:43:06.268 --> 01:43:07.435
Here's the pitch.

01:43:10.104 --> 01:43:12.240
Bite me on the butt
and call me an apple!

01:43:12.974 --> 01:43:14.408
She nearly took her head off!

01:43:15.309 --> 01:43:16.811
Mordabito scores!

01:43:21.148 --> 01:43:22.516
Murphy, she will score!

01:43:23.150 --> 01:43:25.352
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1!

01:43:29.355 --> 01:43:30.356
That's my wife!

01:43:45.036 --> 01:43:46.271
One more!

01:43:47.205 --> 01:43:48.706
Keep it going!

01:43:52.543 --> 01:43:54.745
Put it past the little queen here.

01:43:55.512 --> 01:43:56.747
Right past her!

01:43:57.748 --> 01:43:59.383
There's a fly ball to left field.

01:44:00.016 --> 01:44:01.918
She'll have to go for this one!

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.154
That's the final out.

01:44:05.755 --> 01:44:07.190
But the damage has been done.

01:44:07.857 --> 01:44:10.726
Right here in Racine,
Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1...

01:44:11.727 --> 01:44:13.762
...as we go to the bottom of the 9th.

01:44:14.863 --> 01:44:17.265
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now. Relax!

01:44:19.034 --> 01:44:21.069
One run and we are back
in this ball game.

01:44:21.836 --> 01:44:24.038
Shake it off. You gotta hit.

01:44:30.311 --> 01:44:31.812
It's okay, Kit.

01:44:39.753 --> 01:44:41.654
Strike her out!

01:44:42.355 --> 01:44:44.257
Bad eye! Bat at that, blond girl!

01:44:48.527 --> 01:44:50.229
She drives it to deep centre!

01:44:50.929 --> 01:44:52.297
Mordabito goes to the wall...

01:44:53.098 --> 01:44:55.066
...and makes the catch!

01:44:56.701 --> 01:44:58.269
Beautiful catch!

01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:00.371
Beautiful!

01:45:01.773 --> 01:45:03.608
Gotlander's pitch...

01:45:04.275 --> 01:45:06.644
...and it is in the dirt! Ball 1!

01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.815
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!

01:45:12.616 --> 01:45:14.517
Shake that one off!

01:45:15.218 --> 01:45:16.219
That ain't nothing!

01:45:19.222 --> 01:45:21.424
Gotlander, she delivers.

01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:24.326
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.

01:45:25.094 --> 01:45:25.894
This ball is hot!

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:28.497
Hendricks will go up at 1 st
with a base hit.

01:45:31.766 --> 01:45:34.369
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down! Let's go!

01:45:40.641 --> 01:45:42.543
Foul ball! Hinson's taking after it.

01:45:43.244 --> 01:45:44.044
That does it!

01:45:44.478 --> 01:45:45.546
Did she get it?

01:45:46.613 --> 01:45:48.248
She got it! She got it!

01:45:50.884 --> 01:45:53.086
There's no question who the star
of this game is.

01:45:53.887 --> 01:45:57.123
Dottie Hinson has her team
1 out from the title.

01:46:02.561 --> 01:46:05.430
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now. Let's go.

01:46:12.303 --> 01:46:15.306
The last batter standing
in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.

01:46:16.307 --> 01:46:18.142
Kit is 1 for 3 today.

01:46:28.084 --> 01:46:29.853
- Can I have time-out?
- Time!

01:46:42.664 --> 01:46:45.800
High fastballs. She can't hit them,
can't lay off them.

01:46:46.835 --> 01:46:47.502
All right.

01:46:48.136 --> 01:46:51.005
All right, if we just hold them now,
we got it! Come on!

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:53.641
Come on, Ellen Sue!

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:55.643
One, two, three!

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:04.984
Play ball!

01:47:12.925 --> 01:47:14.293
- Strike!
- Swing and a miss.

01:47:14.893 --> 01:47:15.961
Strike 1!

01:47:16.428 --> 01:47:17.529
Yes! Thank you, God!

01:47:18.063 --> 01:47:19.831
Lay off the high ones!

01:47:29.507 --> 01:47:30.508
Here's the pitch.

01:47:31.108 --> 01:47:32.810
Swing and a miss! Strike 2!

01:47:38.181 --> 01:47:40.350
One more! One more!

01:47:59.934 --> 01:48:01.236
Here's the pitch.

01:48:02.537 --> 01:48:04.505
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.

01:48:07.274 --> 01:48:08.008
It falls in there!

01:48:08.442 --> 01:48:09.877
No one'll get to this ball!

01:48:10.611 --> 01:48:12.846
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!

01:48:13.613 --> 01:48:14.548
She will...

01:48:14.981 --> 01:48:15.715
...score!

01:48:16.116 --> 01:48:16.983
Keller to 3rd!

01:48:19.219 --> 01:48:21.754
Gardner hits the relay man
with a frozen rope!

01:48:24.457 --> 01:48:27.893
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign
at 3rd! But she is not stopping!

01:48:28.994 --> 01:48:30.262
She runs through the stop sign!

01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:32.030
She is not stopping!

01:48:32.564 --> 01:48:33.932
Here comes the throw!

01:48:34.499 --> 01:48:35.600
It should be in time!

01:48:48.378 --> 01:48:49.179
Safe!

01:48:52.015 --> 01:48:53.917
She is safe! I can't believe it!

01:48:54.717 --> 01:48:55.985
Hinson dropped the ball!

01:48:56.552 --> 01:48:57.720
Hinson dropped the ball!

01:48:58.788 --> 01:49:01.590
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2...

01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:04.059
...and the World Series!

01:49:05.194 --> 01:49:07.596
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!

01:49:08.497 --> 01:49:11.800
I have seen enough to know
I have seen too much!

01:49:49.033 --> 01:49:50.535
You played a good game.

01:50:02.279 --> 01:50:03.580
Well, what do you say?

01:50:04.948 --> 01:50:06.116
All right, Ira.

01:50:06.683 --> 01:50:08.051
We'll stick with it.

01:50:08.985 --> 01:50:11.787
My mother always used to say,
"If at first you don't succeed-"

01:50:12.688 --> 01:50:15.090
You don't have to spend
six months in Saskatchewan.

01:50:15.925 --> 01:50:18.994
- Alice, you told me it's lovely.
- If you like icicles.

01:50:20.028 --> 01:50:21.596
I thought we were gonna win.

01:50:22.264 --> 01:50:24.532
- We didn't.
- Up to that last inning, we had it.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.969
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.

01:50:29.837 --> 01:50:31.272
It's all right.

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.441
You did good.

01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:38.478
Get dressed. See you on the bus.

01:50:40.447 --> 01:50:41.381
Thanks.

01:50:47.887 --> 01:50:49.722
Wanna be a ballplayer
when you get big?

01:50:51.023 --> 01:50:52.858
- What's your name?
- Angelina.

01:50:59.764 --> 01:51:01.266
Gotta practice really hard.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.268
What's your name?

01:51:03.735 --> 01:51:05.169
- How much?
- Help yourself.

01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:06.637
Thank you.

01:51:07.138 --> 01:51:09.039
- Hitting!
- You all like hitting better?

01:51:09.807 --> 01:51:11.241
- What's your name?
- Mary.

01:51:14.144 --> 01:51:15.645
- Who you rooting for?
- Racine!

01:51:16.313 --> 01:51:18.081
That's what I thought you said.

01:51:20.116 --> 01:51:22.151
You guys be good. Get dirty.

01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:37.999
- I'm sorry I knocked you over.
- No, you're not.

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.002
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you-

01:51:41.769 --> 01:51:43.404
You did what you had to.

01:51:44.071 --> 01:51:45.773
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.

01:51:47.107 --> 01:51:49.576
I jammed my shoulder,
if it makes you feel any better.

01:51:52.145 --> 01:51:53.079
A little.

01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:59.419
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.

01:52:02.421 --> 01:52:03.722
You two should be alone.

01:52:04.256 --> 01:52:05.624
I'd just be in the way.

01:52:06.225 --> 01:52:07.793
When will you be coming home?

01:52:09.795 --> 01:52:13.298
Some of the girls talked about
staying around here and getting jobs.

01:52:14.999 --> 01:52:16.501
I really like it here.

01:52:17.268 --> 01:52:18.202
Christmas?

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.209
I don't know. You'll come back
next year, right?

01:52:27.778 --> 01:52:29.613
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.

01:52:30.847 --> 01:52:33.049
You got plenty of time to have kids.

01:52:34.484 --> 01:52:36.119
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.

01:52:36.819 --> 01:52:37.620
Miss it?

01:52:38.087 --> 01:52:39.655
Miss putting on all this gear?

01:52:40.256 --> 01:52:43.125
Catching a double-header in 100-degree
heat? Pushing the bus in mud?

01:52:44.092 --> 01:52:46.695
Getting slammed into every other day
by a base runner?

01:52:47.662 --> 01:52:49.097
Think I'm gonna miss that?

01:52:52.667 --> 01:52:54.102
I'll tell you what I'll miss.

01:52:56.537 --> 01:52:57.905
I'll miss the girls.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:00.240
I'll miss you.

01:53:01.542 --> 01:53:02.476
Me?

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.579
How many sisters do you think I have?

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:11.551
I love you, Kit.

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:14.353
Really?

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:19.124
Just when I want you to stay,
you're leaving.

01:53:27.966 --> 01:53:29.667
Thanks for getting me in the league.

01:53:31.102 --> 01:53:33.971
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.

01:53:35.773 --> 01:53:36.640
Play great.

01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:39.076
Like you.

01:53:41.678 --> 01:53:42.545
You stay in touch.

01:53:43.346 --> 01:53:44.914
Come home every once in a while.

01:53:45.815 --> 01:53:48.751
If you don't, I'll come back
and hit line drives at your head.

01:53:53.555 --> 01:53:54.823
I love you.

01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.995
And you are gonna miss this.

01:54:00.962 --> 01:54:02.330
I don't care what you say.

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:06.834
There's the winner!

01:54:07.301 --> 01:54:08.669
Good game, Jimmy.

01:54:10.871 --> 01:54:13.607
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.

01:54:16.676 --> 01:54:18.979
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.

01:54:27.053 --> 01:54:28.420
Old man Harvey just...

01:54:29.021 --> 01:54:31.290
...offered me a job managing
next year in Wichita.

01:54:33.191 --> 01:54:34.893
Triple A? Great. Good luck.

01:54:35.627 --> 01:54:36.561
Turned him down.

01:54:37.295 --> 01:54:38.029
Why?

01:54:38.496 --> 01:54:39.797
What do you mean, why?

01:54:40.398 --> 01:54:41.632
I already got a job.

01:54:46.537 --> 01:54:47.638
I'll see you.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.976
Miss Cuthbert, save me
my special seat, now, cutie!

01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:55.111
Meet you at the hotel.

01:55:03.686 --> 01:55:05.054
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?

01:55:05.688 --> 01:55:08.290
I'd rather see you play ball
instead of what you used to do.

01:55:09.558 --> 01:55:11.960
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!

01:55:12.827 --> 01:55:13.762
Steak dinner.

01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:15.864
On you. I'll see you later.

01:55:16.564 --> 01:55:18.666
Kit, over here! Come on, let's go!

01:55:30.076 --> 01:55:31.311
That was Bob, huh?

01:55:32.078 --> 01:55:33.179
Nice guy.

01:55:42.021 --> 01:55:43.255
Lay off of those high ones.

01:55:44.890 --> 01:55:45.991
I like the high ones.

01:55:47.192 --> 01:55:48.493
- Mule!
- Nag!

01:56:24.693 --> 01:56:26.261
Hey, Mae. Come here.

01:56:27.562 --> 01:56:28.863
- What do you want?
- Come here.

01:56:31.232 --> 01:56:32.466
- What is it?
- Look at her.

01:56:39.139 --> 01:56:40.073
It's Dottie.

01:56:42.375 --> 01:56:43.376
Hey, Doris.

01:56:49.048 --> 01:56:50.616
Mae? All-the-Way Mae?

01:56:51.250 --> 01:56:53.219
- No one's called me that since-
- Last night!

01:56:53.953 --> 01:56:55.054
I'm a married woman now.

01:56:55.587 --> 01:56:56.755
Yeah, about eight times.

01:56:57.289 --> 01:56:59.558
Girls! Look who's here!

01:57:00.325 --> 01:57:01.326
Shirley?

01:57:05.763 --> 01:57:07.265
Helen Haley!

01:57:07.932 --> 01:57:11.435
- It's Dr. Haley now. I'm a doctor.
- I always knew you would be.

01:57:12.836 --> 01:57:14.204
- Who's that?
- Dottie Hinson.

01:57:15.239 --> 01:57:16.540
Betty Spaghetti?

01:57:17.307 --> 01:57:18.809
Best ballplayer in the league.

01:57:19.409 --> 01:57:21.444
- I don't remember her.
- She only played one year.

01:57:22.312 --> 01:57:23.813
Ellen Sue!

01:57:26.482 --> 01:57:28.384
You haven't changed one bit.

01:57:29.418 --> 01:57:31.553
I married a plastic surgeon.

01:57:33.489 --> 01:57:35.190
Having you here is good luck.

01:57:35.824 --> 01:57:37.125
Thanks, Alice!

01:57:47.334 --> 01:57:48.269
Marla!

01:57:52.573 --> 01:57:54.274
I'm so glad you're here.

01:57:54.941 --> 01:57:57.344
- How's...?
- Nelson? He's good.

01:57:58.178 --> 01:58:00.213
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.

01:58:03.282 --> 01:58:04.083
How's Bob?

01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:06.652
He's...

01:58:08.821 --> 01:58:09.488
When?

01:58:10.455 --> 01:58:11.757
Just this winter.

01:58:13.692 --> 01:58:14.960
I'm sorry.

01:58:20.331 --> 01:58:22.566
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.

01:58:23.334 --> 01:58:24.835
I've got butterflies in my stomach!

01:58:25.502 --> 01:58:28.739
They've got a "Women In Baseball"
thing up there. Isn't it neat?

01:58:29.773 --> 01:58:32.108
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.

01:58:32.976 --> 01:58:34.277
Wait a minute here.

01:58:35.445 --> 01:58:37.280
- Guess who that is?
- Who?

01:58:43.786 --> 01:58:44.520
You remember?

01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:46.755
You're gonna lose.

01:58:49.891 --> 01:58:50.892
Stilwell, angel!

01:58:52.193 --> 01:58:53.061
My goodness!

01:58:54.696 --> 01:58:55.697
Where's your mom?

01:58:56.764 --> 01:58:58.799
Mom died a couple of years ago.

01:59:00.334 --> 01:59:01.435
I'm sorry.

01:59:01.936 --> 01:59:03.437
She was a real nice lady.

01:59:04.371 --> 01:59:06.006
And a damn fine ballplayer.

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:11.644
When I heard about this, I...

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.648
...felt like I...

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.550
...owed it to her to be here.

01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:21.220
She always said it was the best time
she had in her whole life.

01:59:25.123 --> 01:59:26.057
Come here.

01:59:30.061 --> 01:59:31.696
Recognize yourself?

01:59:35.132 --> 01:59:36.901
- Can I get one of these?
- Sure.

02:00:02.190 --> 02:00:03.191
Ladies!

02:00:04.092 --> 02:00:06.261
It's a pleasure to welcome you
here today.

02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:09.197
It's taken years,
but you are the first women...

02:00:09.997 --> 02:00:13.067
...ever to be inducted
into the Baseball Hall of Fame!

02:00:15.869 --> 02:00:18.205
- And now-
- Wait. Wait a minute.

02:00:19.506 --> 02:00:21.208
This really isn't right.

02:00:22.008 --> 02:00:23.176
Mr. Lowenstein...

02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:26.312
...since you kept the league going
all those years...

02:00:29.148 --> 02:00:30.082
...you do it.

02:00:31.484 --> 02:00:33.752
- There you go, Ira.
- Thank you, Bob.

02:00:36.688 --> 02:00:37.789
Ladies...

02:00:40.091 --> 02:00:41.326
...it's my honour.

02:00:55.038 --> 02:00:58.375
Mr. Capadino, look! That's when you
changed my life, honey!

02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:32.072
Stilwell, angel, smile!

02:01:50.055 --> 02:01:52.257
<i>Batter up</i>

02:01:53.224 --> 02:01:54.993
<i>Hear that call</i>

02:01:56.361 --> 02:01:58.529
<i>The time has come</i>

02:02:00.064 --> 02:02:02.032
<i>For one and all</i>

02:02:04.134 --> 02:02:07.004
<i>To play</i>

02:02:07.938 --> 02:02:09.773
<i>Ball</i>

02:02:10.874 --> 02:02:13.243
<i>We're the members of</i>

02:02:14.077 --> 02:02:15.712
<i>The All-American League</i>

02:02:16.379 --> 02:02:18.281
<i>We come from cities</i>

02:02:19.548 --> 02:02:21.650
<i>Near and far</i>

02:02:22.384 --> 02:02:24.486
<i>We've got Canadians</i>

02:02:25.554 --> 02:02:26.988
<i>Irish ones and Swedes</i>

02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:29.891
<i>We're all for one
We're one for all</i>

02:02:30.725 --> 02:02:32.927
<i>We're All-Americans</i>

02:02:35.429 --> 02:02:36.797
Is that you, Grandma?

02:03:02.254 --> 02:03:04.022
I'm so glad you came.

02:03:05.857 --> 02:03:07.492
Hi, Aunt Dottie.

02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:15.232
Take a picture.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.836
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!
