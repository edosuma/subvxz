<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.470
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:14.765
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:18.310
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.772
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:23.190
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:25.150
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:30.239
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:34.910 --> 00:39.831
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to the NBA on TNT... on LSD.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:44.294
<i>Man, I'm out my mind!</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:48.423
Okay, my mom will be here
any minute for our spa day.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.425
"Spa," S-P-A.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.636
Yes, very good, Peter.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.180
And remember,
while we're off getting our massages,

00:55.264 --> 00:57.182
you and Daddy are gonna
spend the day together here.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.184
Aw, I don't want to hang out with him.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.978
He's, like, not ticklish anywhere.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.773
Look, I'm sorry, but my mom said
he can't be left alone at home anymore.

01:04.857 --> 01:08.485
Last time, he went crazy and
moved all the furniture around.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.904
<i>Dancing, walking</i>

01:10.988 --> 01:13.907
<i>Rearranging furniture</i>

01:13.991 --> 01:16.702
<i>Babs is shopping</i>

01:16.785 --> 01:19.454
<i>I let the bird out of the cage...</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:23.208
Hello, dear.

01:23.292 --> 01:27.588
Oh, I always forget you walk right into
the living room in your house.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.047
Hey, do you have a Band-Aid?

01:29.131 --> 01:30.883
Nothing happened, but I'm bleeding.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.968
You know what, I'll just
rummage through your bathroom.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.430
Man, spending a whole day with him

01:36.513 --> 01:38.432
is gonna be worse than
eating at a ball park.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.225
Uh, I'll take one terrible beer,

01:40.309 --> 01:42.227
filled up way too high,
so I spill most of it,

01:42.311 --> 01:45.272
and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.565
And do you have mustard and relish?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.317
Yeah, it's right there
between the entrance

01:48.400 --> 01:49.610
and the exit to the bathroom.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.612
Perfect. And can I get
a bag of unsalted peanuts?

01:51.695 --> 01:53.113
You know, something I would never eat

01:53.197 --> 01:54.406
anywhere else in the world?

01:54.489 --> 01:56.742
- Sure, here you go.
- Great, great.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.703
I can't wait to have diarrhea
in the stall with no door

01:59.786 --> 02:01.914
while 20 guys wait for me to finish.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.337
- No. Ah, no.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.339
All right, left cankle, red.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.134
Right muffin top, blue.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.931
Sorry.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.058
Ugh, God, kill me.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.061
Stewie, I can't take any more
of Meg and her gross friends.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.481
Ah, ah, hang on, hang on.
I'm just finishing up an e-mail to Delta.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.234
"I have never not screamed
at the top of my lungs

02:30.317 --> 02:33.487
during air pressure changes,
and I do not intend to stop now."

02:33.570 --> 02:35.531
- Okay, what was it?
- Meg's friends.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.033
They're just so loud
and boring and annoying.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.869
Well, not everybody
can be as fascinating as you, Brian.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.371
Thanks for coming by.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.956
Hey, Brian, Mom took the car.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.167
Can you give me and my friends
a ride to field hockey practice?

02:47.251 --> 02:50.671
Uh, I'm kind of helping Stewie
with an e-mail to Delta.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.256
Please, Brian.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.091
It would get them out of the house.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.343
Well, that's true.
And I gotta do something,

02:56.426 --> 02:58.929
'cause they're more annoying
than ants at a picnic.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.099
Would you mind turning that down?

03:04.476 --> 03:06.687
And you're not supposed to be grilling.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.314
I know you can understand me.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.948
So... what, uh, what do you want to do?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.742
I don't know.
Sucks that we're stuck here alone.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.287
Wait a minute, here alone.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.122
You thinking what I'm thinking?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.874
This was not what I was thinking.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.750
That's weird,
it's not what I was thinking either.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.502
I don't even know how it happened.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.588
No, me neither,
but this spaghetti's not half bad.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.339
A "happy mistake," we'll call it.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.553
Now what do you want to do?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.097
Well, we could watch porn.
Have you heard of porn?

03:42.181 --> 03:45.350
- Is that something you're aware of?
- You have postcards from France?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.144
No, no, no, like... Like, on the computer.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.397
There's like tons and tons of videos
of people doing it on there.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.026
Wait, l-let me understand,
You want to watch <i>that</i> with <i>me?</i>

03:54.109 --> 03:55.986
Well, not anymore, you just made it weird.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.404
But there's other stuff on there.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.032
You want to see a guy
in a human-sized hamster ball

04:00.115 --> 04:02.326
- roll off a mountain?
- Uh, yeah.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.121
So this is in Russia?

04:06.205 --> 04:07.915
Somebody's gonna slow him down, right?

04:07.998 --> 04:09.416
Whoa!

04:09.499 --> 04:12.461
I got to e-mail that to Babs.
She hates people.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.463
Huh, got a new e-mail here.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.465
And it's from a Nigerian prince.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.259
It says he's got millions
frozen in an account.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.012
All he needs is a hundred grand
to pay legal fees,

04:22.095 --> 04:25.182
and then as soon as he gets his money,
I get a million bucks.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.850
Wow, and he must need it quick,

04:26.934 --> 04:29.186
'cause there was, like,
a bazillion typos in that e-mail.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.646
You got to send that money.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.105
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.775
I mean, can you imagine
if you make a million bucks?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.319
You'll be happier
than the guy on his wedding day.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.738
Thanks, everyone.
Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.782
Good-bye, friends. Good-bye, free time.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.576
Farewell, sex. So long, golf on TV.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.161
I'll miss you, privacy.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.872
Good-bye, being honest
about how many beers I've had.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.292
Nice knowing you, my own choices.
See ya' later, money!

04:57.130 --> 04:58.465
Thanks for the ride, Brian.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.844
Yeah, and thanks for the lecture
on what real music is, Mr. Griffin.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.183
Geez, how many Snickers could they eat
in a five-minute car ride?

05:08.267 --> 05:10.853
Ah, crap, somebody left their gym bag.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.108
God, it would've been real easy
to bring a gun in here.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.569
Where the hell'd they go?

05:21.572 --> 05:22.573
Oh, whoops.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.119
<i>Ooh, yeah...</i>

05:29.121 --> 05:30.581
Wow.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.795
Holy crap. That was Patty.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.547
And she's got a smokin' hot body.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.676
This is a bigger surprise than
when I found out Joe was a clown.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
I think that belongs to me.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.643
- I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
- Okay.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.438
- You won't tell anyone, will you?
- No.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.481
You can tell people.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.905
Hey, so how was the spa?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.616
Oh, it was fine,
though I don't know why they made us

06:05.699 --> 06:08.368
face each other during
the mother-daughter bikini wax.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.537
Did you two have a nice afternoon?

06:10.621 --> 06:12.539
Sure did. I made a million dollars!

06:12.623 --> 06:14.291
What! How?

06:14.374 --> 06:18.504
Carter sent $100,000 to a Nigerian prince
who's gonna give him a million.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.173
Oh, Peter, don't tell me
you two fell for that scam.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.925
What? What are you talking about?

06:23.008 --> 06:25.344
It's the oldest e-mail scam out there.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.679
Their assets are frozen,
you cover legal fees.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.014
Blah, blah, blah.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.225
Oh, my God, he did say,
"Blah, blah, blah."

06:31.308 --> 06:33.185
You're never getting that money back.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.938
What! So that-that money's
just been Josh Hartnett-ed!

06:36.021 --> 06:38.106
- What's that?
- Gone! Disappeared!

06:38.190 --> 06:39.650
Never to be heard from again!

06:39.733 --> 06:42.694
Isn't he in that Showtime thing
with the blood and the hats?

06:42.778 --> 06:45.322
- Look, the point is I was swindled.
- I guess so.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.616
Well, come on, Mom,
the man was very specific

06:47.699 --> 06:49.868
that we need to go
put lotion on each other.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.998
Geez, I'm really sorry, Carter.
But at least you have your health.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.877
- Oh...
- You know, this is your fault.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.921
You're the one who said I should do it!

07:01.004 --> 07:02.589
Mm-hmm, there's that judgy-ness

07:02.673 --> 07:04.633
Babs is always calling me
and talking about.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.010
Look, nobody steals
from Carter Pewterschmidt.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.137
I am going to Africa
and getting my money back.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.933
- And you're coming with me.
- Africa? We're going to Africa!

07:13.016 --> 07:14.893
I wonder if it will change us.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.020
But, of course, it did change us.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.065
I've been working here for 50 years,
pretending I'm a woman.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.902
Do you ever regret
not having children, Mother Bernadette?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.946
Oh, I've had many children.

07:39.751 --> 07:43.463
<i>We now return to</i>
Kevin James Got Too Fat To Be In Movies.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.466
Kevin James, why'd you have
to come back to television?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.468
I ate Adam Sandler.

07:48.552 --> 07:52.389
Uh, yoo-hoo! I'm in here with the pizza.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.144
Okay, time to go to Africa
and get my money back.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.563
- Are you ready?
- I was born three months early.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.481
Peter, who's that at the door?

08:01.565 --> 08:04.359
Oh, just so you know,
I didn't tell Lois where we're going,

08:04.443 --> 08:06.570
and I couldn't be touched until I was two.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.031
- Daddy, what are you doing here?
- Oh, hey, Lois.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.824
Uh, Carter and I are going away
for the next week or so.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.367
You are? Where?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.620
Oh, uh... We're, uh...

08:14.703 --> 08:16.622
I mean, um...

08:16.705 --> 08:18.624
- Pinterest!
- Wow, sounds great.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.833
Have fun.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.168
This is getting easier.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.170
Now I just say daytime-mom words.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.465
Okay, so see you soon, and...
Chablis <i>The View.</i>

08:26.548 --> 08:29.134
Aw, you too, sweetheart. Bye.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.308
I'm telling you,
you wouldn't believe Patty's body.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.144
Just, uh, a tiny waist,
firm butt, great rack.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.104
<i>She's in high school</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:42.898
I know, <i>and</i> she's in high school.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.442
It's, like, 7:00 a.m., dude. Calm down.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.278
- Meg, hey, how's it going?
- Uh, hey, Brian.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.697
Cool, that's great to hear.
Hey, where's Patty?

08:50.781 --> 08:52.783
Oh, I don't know. Probably at her house?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.576
You're hilarious, Meg.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.746
Hey, so, uh, what kind of movies
do you and your friends like?

08:57.829 --> 08:58.956
- Well, Ruth likes...
- Not her.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.332
- Esther likes...
- Not her.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.875
- I like...
- Patty, just Patty.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.460
Oh, she loves anything

09:03.544 --> 09:05.963
where a teenage girl
is sick and dies of cancer.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.465
Or any movie where
a character is named Patty.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.676
Ugh, she loses her mind for that.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.846
Well, okay, Miss Chatterbox,
you better get off to school.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.140
Wow, you're really obsessed with Patty.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.810
You want her even more than
I wanted the new iPhone.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.019
- How's it going?
- Good.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.855
Just looking forward
to getting that new phone.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.566
What are you talking about?
This isn't the Apple store.

09:25.649 --> 09:26.900
This is a super-gay club.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.152
Yeah, right, I leave and you get my phone.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.029
Nice try, cutie pie.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.256
Wow, there's so much wildlife in Africa.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.258
You know, they say
there's some animal species here

09:51.341 --> 09:54.052
- that haven't even been discovered yet.
- Is that right?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.846
Yes, that is right.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.806
Oh, my God, look over there!

10:00.434 --> 10:02.144
That African warlord is brutalizing

10:02.227 --> 10:03.937
- those innocent people.
- Yeah, but it's okay,

10:04.021 --> 10:07.774
because he's wearing a large cowboy hat
and follows everything with "hamburger,"

10:07.858 --> 10:09.818
like that stand-up comic from the '90s.

10:09.902 --> 10:13.739
We are going to force all these
young boys to be child soldiers.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.617
- Hamburger.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.243
After 18 hours in the mines,

10:18.327 --> 10:20.579
we are going to check
your butts for diamonds.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.122
Hamburger.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.498
I get it.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.709
If you do not work
on my rubber plantation,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.419
I will burn your tongues.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.837
Oh, my God!

10:28.921 --> 10:31.632
- Hamburger.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.635
Ah, I found him. Alonzo "Hamburger" Jones.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.262
He made it to YouTube.
Must be filthy rich.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.354
Oh, my God!
I didn't expect to see you guys here.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.814
So teenagers know about the mall, too?

10:47.898 --> 10:49.900
- Know what about the mall?
- Yeah, right?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.693
Boy, the day I'm having.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.405
I actually made one too many Build-a-Bears
for the cancer kids.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.616
If only I could build a cure, huh?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.451
- Aw...
- Hey, you know what, Patty?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.203
Why don't you take the extra one?

11:01.286 --> 11:03.664
- Wow, thanks, Brian.
- Yeah, that's cool, Brian.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.791
- Will you buy me a hat at Lids?
- No.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.961
You know, Patty, I've got $7.50 left
on my Panda Express card,

11:09.044 --> 11:10.796
if you want to split a three-item combo.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.256
- No drink.
- Sure!

11:12.339 --> 11:15.008
Well, then, hop on board
the Panda Express!

11:15.092 --> 11:17.135
In bed, right?

11:17.219 --> 11:19.680
Like-- Like with the fortune cookies,
you know...

11:19.763 --> 11:22.015
Brian, can I talk to you for a second?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.809
What the hell is going on?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.770
You're hitting on Patty and it's gross.
She's 18!

11:26.854 --> 11:28.564
- Stop it!
- Me?

11:28.647 --> 11:31.817
Meg, I am not even going to dignify that
with a mall erection.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.069
Don't... Don't look down.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.994
Well, we made it.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.871
East Bola.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.833
All right, let's find our "prince"
and get my money back.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.168
Get down!

11:49.251 --> 11:50.669
- On the ground!

11:50.752 --> 11:51.837
This is unacceptable.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.839
I demand to speak to Anthony Anderson.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.470
Okay, hold on. Shoot me if you must,

12:00.554 --> 12:02.806
but it is imperative
that I answer this call.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.185
Yello?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.978
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.231
Yes, I did call you
about the eight-piece lawn croquet set.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.984
Now, it says "weathered,"
just how weathered is it?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.987
Yeah, go ahead and send me a pic,
that'd be very helpful.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.032
Sir, shoot me if you must,

12:20.115 --> 12:22.659
but it is imperative
that I look at these pictures.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.585
The hell with this.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.338
I'm getting my money back
if it's the last thing I do.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.215
Hey, here's the guys.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.300
Who are you and why are you here?

12:38.383 --> 12:41.637
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt,
and I'm here because you stole my money!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.889
You? You are Carter Pewterschmidt?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.140
You're damn right I am!

12:45.224 --> 12:46.642
Oh! It's him!

12:46.725 --> 12:48.894
It's the Great Father Pewterschmidt!

12:48.977 --> 12:51.104
What's happening? What's he talking about?

12:51.188 --> 12:53.148
You are a great hero to us.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.067
It is with the money that you sent

12:55.150 --> 12:56.652
that we have been able to make

12:56.735 --> 12:58.862
many wonderful improvements
to our village.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.489
And he used my computer.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.242
I'm Griff, by the way,
that's what everybody calls me.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.285
That's not true. Nobody calls him that.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.749
It was your money
that paid for the school,

13:10.832 --> 13:13.293
a well to provide clean drinking water,

13:13.377 --> 13:15.546
our first health clinic,

13:15.629 --> 13:18.048
and a Redbox with one movie in it.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.591
It's <i>Baby Geniuses.</i>

13:19.675 --> 13:21.593
Which I, personally, could begin watching

13:21.677 --> 13:23.679
at any point in the film
and enjoy from there.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.514
Oh, yeah, that's how
I feel about that video

13:25.597 --> 13:27.140
of Kelsey Grammer fallin' off the stage.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.559
I don't understand.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.269
So there never was a Nigerian prince?

13:30.352 --> 13:33.981
No. You see, no one will actually
give money to Africa

13:34.064 --> 13:35.732
unless they are tricked into it.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.319
So again, we thank you
for your generosity, Father Pewterschmidt.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.864
Well, I hope you enjoyed it...
'cause I'm taking it all back.

13:41.947 --> 13:42.990
What?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.283
You heard me!

13:44.366 --> 13:46.577
Nobody steals from Carter Pewterschmidt
and gets away with it!

13:46.660 --> 13:49.162
Carter, why you bein' so mean?
The money's spent.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.331
And look how happy you made these people.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.417
Talk to me, it's your buddy Griff.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.960
Tear it all down! Now.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.171
Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.923
- What is Kwanzaa?
- Ah! I knew it wasn't real!

14:04.094 --> 14:05.304
Hey, there, babe.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.597
Hey, Brian.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.140
You ready?

14:08.223 --> 14:09.975
Got the <i>Smash Mouth</i> cued up in the Pri.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.061
- Brian, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to pick up Patty.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.980
We're going to see a movie
called <i>Brittany Finds a Lump.</i>

14:15.063 --> 14:16.982
You're parked in Mr. Tackleman's space.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.734
You're going on a date with Patty?

14:18.817 --> 14:20.027
I told you to back off.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.029
And since when do you wear high-tops?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.364
What, my kicks? Ah, it's nothin'.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.866
I just use these for Instagram.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.201
That's something I like!

14:27.284 --> 14:28.327
Ah, shut up, Esther!

14:28.410 --> 14:30.204
All right, we're out of here.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.539
Feel free to use the seat warmer,
keep that box hot.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.126
<i> Somebody once told me</i>

14:36.210 --> 14:37.836
<i>The world is gonna...</i>

14:45.677 --> 14:47.971
Geez, I can't believe
you're going through with this, Carter.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.973
Paying these thugs
to tear down the village

14:50.057 --> 14:52.809
- isn't gonna bring your money back.
- This isn't about the money.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.020
This is payback for Sammy Davis
dating Kim Novak.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.064
Oh, come on, Carter, don't do this.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.024
You don't want to be the first white guy

14:59.107 --> 15:00.275
to do something bad to Africa.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.652
Are you about done?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.488
I'm supposed to go lion shooting
with a scumbag dentist.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.036
Oh, my God, they're even taking
down the mosquito netting.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.208
<i>Buzz, buzz, buzz</i>

15:18.377 --> 15:20.087
No, Carter, I can't let you do this!

15:20.170 --> 15:23.465
I won't stand by and let you further ruin
this terrible place!

15:23.549 --> 15:25.133
Oh, is that right?

15:25.217 --> 15:26.844
Yes, that is right.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.888
Here's 5,000 bucks. Lock up that fat-ass.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.855
Damn it, this sucks.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.481
I may never get out of here.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.526
Well, as a man
falsely imprisoned in Africa,

15:42.609 --> 15:45.737
I have no choice but to write
a memoir of my struggles.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.614
"Chapter One,

15:47.698 --> 15:51.118
"Harry Potter's aunt and uncle
were super mean.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.413
"'Spank me harder,' the lady
says to Fifty Shades of Grey.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.082
"'That's Mr. Fifty Shades of Grey

15:57.165 --> 15:58.834
"to you, Kate from <i>Ben and Kate.'</i>

15:58.917 --> 16:01.044
"And then he turned her butt inside out.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.963
Because, sexy."

16:03.046 --> 16:05.674
"'Isn't that special,'
said the Church Lady,

16:05.757 --> 16:08.010
"before reporting for her botched surgery.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.345
"Anyway, I'm here in a prison
against my will,

16:10.429 --> 16:14.183
"and I should be free. The end."

16:14.266 --> 16:15.309
Take this, Cheebo.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.769
Take this to a French-Canadian
flight attendant.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.730
And he will give it to everybody.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.120
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
Our top story, sinking newscaster.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.207
Just kidding, it's the chair.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.126
But, in other news,
domestic abuse enthusiast Paul Simon

16:41.210 --> 16:43.879
has released a new song
inspired by a memoir

16:43.962 --> 16:45.881
written by Quahog's own Peter Griffin,

16:45.964 --> 16:48.550
who has been falsely imprisoned
by his father-in-law

16:48.634 --> 16:50.135
in an African jail.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.304
Oh, for God's sake.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.015
I bet there's not one word
about you in that book.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.938
Wow, what a beautiful night.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.397
Yeah.

17:02.481 --> 17:05.400
Hey, I wonder if any of those
stars are wishing on us, huh?

17:05.484 --> 17:07.194
You're so deep.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.154
I betcha you're pretty deep, too.

17:09.238 --> 17:12.241
Aw, you're so sweet.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.243
Why are you so nice to me?

17:14.326 --> 17:17.788
Most guys never give me the time of day
because I'm so plain-looking.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.707
Well, I'm not like most guys.
I can see pas that sweater.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.251
Speaking of which,

17:22.334 --> 17:24.461
why don't we get rid
of that big old thing?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.380
Brian, stop!

17:26.463 --> 17:29.633
You don't have to do this, Patty.
Brian's just taking advantage of you.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.260
What? That's crazy!

17:31.343 --> 17:33.178
What? Why would he do that?

17:33.262 --> 17:35.389
Because you have an amazing body.

17:35.472 --> 17:40.435
I do? But...you're always saying
dumpy girls like us only have each other.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.187
You're not dumpy.

17:42.271 --> 17:43.605
I was just saying that

17:43.689 --> 17:45.065
because I was worried you'd become popular

17:45.148 --> 17:46.733
and not want to be friends
with us anymore.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.402
Meg, I'm $18 into this evening,

17:48.485 --> 17:50.279
so can you maybe just get out of here?

17:50.362 --> 17:53.407
Meg, that's silly.
I'll always be your friend.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.158
You promise?

18:01.707 --> 18:04.209
Oh, come on, what the hell?

18:04.293 --> 18:06.962
Bummer. He's never gonna get to hit that.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.881
I know. That's exactly what I wished for.

18:08.964 --> 18:12.384
Well, I actually wished
for it 30,000 years ago.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.432
It's true.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.184
Even at the speed of light,

18:20.267 --> 18:22.394
mean-spirited thoughts from the stars

18:22.477 --> 18:24.646
can take thousands
or even millions of years

18:24.730 --> 18:27.316
to reach the Earth.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.193
Ham-burger.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.618
<i>There's a great man locked up in a cell</i>

18:37.701 --> 18:40.245
<i>The African folks all know him well</i>

18:40.329 --> 18:42.497
<i>He's a great spirit with a lot to say</i>

18:42.581 --> 18:45.250
<i>That's why they locked Peter Griffin away</i>

18:45.334 --> 18:47.794
<i>There's a breeze that's in the air</i>

18:47.878 --> 18:50.464
<i>Peter Griffin in my hair</i>

18:50.547 --> 18:52.841
<i>Peter Griffin up my nose</i>

18:52.925 --> 18:55.427
<i>In my lungs and down to my toes</i>

18:55.511 --> 18:58.055
<i>Peter Griffin in my skin</i>

18:58.138 --> 19:00.307
<i>Everybody breathe him in</i>

19:00.390 --> 19:02.809
<i>Peter Griffin</i>

19:02.893 --> 19:05.312
<i>Freedom for Peter Griffin</i>

19:05.395 --> 19:07.689
<i>Peter Griffin</i>

19:07.773 --> 19:10.859
<i>Let my Peter go</i>

19:10.943 --> 19:14.738
Now wait, let me get this straight,
none of you guys has ever heard of Bono?

19:14.821 --> 19:15.906
He says he knows you.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.451
Daddy! What the hell are you doing?
You threw Peter in jail?

19:19.535 --> 19:20.869
Hey, Pumpkin, welcome!

19:20.994 --> 19:23.497
Whatever you do,
don't tell them you have a clitoris.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.582
Yeah, they told me that at the embassy.

19:25.666 --> 19:29.294
Look, I'm sorry you got swindled,
but you can't treat people this way.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.463
You let Peter out of that jail right now.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.716
And give these people back
their health clinic and their school.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.843
No!

19:35.926 --> 19:37.761
Hi, Lois! I like your shorts!

19:37.845 --> 19:39.304
Bye, Lois!

19:39.388 --> 19:40.430
Oh, my God!

19:40.514 --> 19:41.723
Enough is enough!

19:41.807 --> 19:43.058
That's your son-in-law!

19:43.141 --> 19:44.351
And my husband!

19:44.434 --> 19:46.770
I know how families work, Lois.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.856
All right. Let him go.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.440
Yay!

19:50.524 --> 19:53.694
Lois, how much was your flight
and which card did you put it on?

19:53.777 --> 19:55.737
Daddy, I don't understand any of this.

19:55.821 --> 20:00.284
I mean, you've always been grouchy,
but why are you being so mean-spirited?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.952
What's gotten into you?

20:02.035 --> 20:04.413
What's gotten into me? I'm angry!

20:04.496 --> 20:07.916
For God's sake, I can't even be left alone
in my own house for an afternoon.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.336
You have to drop me off at your house
so this fat idiot can babysit me!

20:11.420 --> 20:13.422
I'm old and it sucks!

20:13.505 --> 20:15.215
I'm sorry, Daddy.

20:15.299 --> 20:19.553
I realize growing old is no fun,
but this is no way to act.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.762
I know.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.806
I'm sorry I almost had you shot.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.141
Oh, that's all right.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.559
I got a fever of a 108.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.436
I'm not gonna remember any of this.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.938
And I'm sorry for what
I did to your village, Dave.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.023
His name is "Dave"?

20:31.106 --> 20:33.567
Yeah. Get to know these people, okay?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.694
Listen, when I get home,
I'll transfer enough money

20:35.777 --> 20:37.237
so you can rebuild your town.

20:37.321 --> 20:38.906
You've all been very kind.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.407
Yeah, this has been great, guys.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.034
Now all I need is a group photo

20:42.117 --> 20:43.702
of me kneeling
in the front of the village,

20:43.785 --> 20:45.871
so I can brag about
what a good person I am.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.552
<i>He's a great spirit with a lot to say</i>

21:00.636 --> 21:03.472
<i>That's why they locked Peter Griffin away</i>

21:03.555 --> 21:05.849
<i>There's a breeze that's in the air</i>

21:05.933 --> 21:08.519
<i>Peter Griffin in my hair</i>

21:08.602 --> 21:10.854
<i>Peter Griffin up my nose</i>

21:10.938 --> 21:13.398
<i>In my lungs and down to my toes</i>

21:13.482 --> 21:15.859
<i>Peter Griffin in my skin</i>

21:15.943 --> 21:18.320
<i>Everybody breathe him in</i>

21:18.403 --> 21:20.906
<i>Peter Griffin</i>

21:20.989 --> 21:23.408
<i>Freedom for Peter Griffin</i>

21:23.492 --> 21:25.744
<i>Peter Griffin</i>

21:25.827 --> 21:28.455
<i>Let my Peter go</i>
