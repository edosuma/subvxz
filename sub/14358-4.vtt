WEBVTT

00:00.963 --> 00:03.244
"The Trip"

00:03.890 --> 00:04.653
<i>Here in the middle,</i>

00:04.704 --> 00:06.670
<i>we have a long tradition
of kids raising</i>

00:06.820 --> 00:09.026
<i>money for their school
by hitting up their neighbours,</i>

00:09.061 --> 00:11.174
<i>to buy crap
they don't want or need.</i>

00:11.527 --> 00:12.995
<i>Following in that
great tradition,</i>

00:13.046 --> 00:15.988
<i>Sue is selling cheese and sausage
for Orson Junior High.</i>

00:16.280 --> 00:18.530
Four exciting varities
of sausage to match

00:18.700 --> 00:21.075
whatever sausage meat
you may find yourself in.

00:21.110 --> 00:22.792
<i>I think what makes Sue
such a good seller</i>

00:22.827 --> 00:24.214
<i>is that
she can take rejection.</i>

00:24.470 --> 00:26.470
<i>Probably cause she's had
so much practice.</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:27.725
Or maybe you can,
perhaps,

00:27.804 --> 00:30.562
show your love of cheese,
cheese ball...

00:31.387 --> 00:34.327
I'll just wait here at the door
in case you change your mind.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.352
<i>Let me tell you:</i>

00:35.422 --> 00:37.177
<i>When it come to selling
cheese and sausage,</i>

00:37.238 --> 00:38.637
<i>Sue was driven.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:41.880
<i>She was driven by Mike
all over Indiana.</i>

00:44.450 --> 00:46.180
<i>Mike took her to Terre Haute...</i>

00:46.340 --> 00:47.479
<i>They went to Gary.</i>

00:47.730 --> 00:49.637
<i>She hit almost
every county in the state.</i>

00:49.930 --> 00:51.866
<i>'Cause if she sells
$3,000 worth,</i>

00:51.916 --> 00:53.903
<i>she wins a free trip,
all the way...</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:55.569
<i>to Indianapolis.</i>

00:56.070 --> 00:58.600
So it's okay
to sell your stuff, Sue,

00:58.740 --> 01:00.758
but, remember,
this is a place of business.

01:00.793 --> 01:02.058
People are busy.

01:05.450 --> 01:07.077
Oh, hey, Bob.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.251
Would you like to help my school
and send me on a trip

01:10.291 --> 01:12.740
to the state capital
by buying some delicious--

01:12.880 --> 01:13.709
I'll take ten.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.820
Really? Oh, my God.
That's great!

01:16.940 --> 01:18.480
I love food you don't
have to refrigerate.

01:18.515 --> 01:20.216
Fridges--
they just tie you down.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.631
That's why I just have
a hot plate and a P.O. Box.

01:23.060 --> 01:25.570
Okay, that'll be $284.

01:25.605 --> 01:27.849
What? Are you...
Ehlert.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.348
Just casually scatter.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.530
Oh, hi, Mr. Ehlert.
Would you like to help my--

01:31.660 --> 01:35.593
No. Frances!
You forgot to make coffee again.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.430
You got me walking
around here like an idiot

01:37.580 --> 01:39.450
with a doughnut and
nothing to dunk it in.

01:39.580 --> 01:41.495
Mr. Ehlert, how come
<i>I'm</i> the one

01:41.530 --> 01:43.520
who's always asked
to make the coffee?

01:43.810 --> 01:46.674
I'm beginning to think
it's because I'm a woman.

01:47.283 --> 01:48.950
Well, of course it's
because you're a woman.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.810
The day I start telling men
to make coffee for women,

01:52.970 --> 01:55.227
you have my permission
to put a bullet in my head.

01:58.445 --> 02:01.285
Wow. Mom,
that is so unfair.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.676
You are not going
to make that coffee, are you?

02:04.790 --> 02:06.577
Eh. Not worth the fight.

02:06.810 --> 02:10.940
<i>All personnel-- I've been informed
there will be fresh coffee shortly.</i>

02:11.860 --> 02:13.945
Hey, can I interest you
in a cheese sampler,

02:13.980 --> 02:15.881
so I can win a trip
to my state capital?

02:16.260 --> 02:18.821
<i>**Put me down for the
jalapeno cheddar ball.</i>

02:18.900 --> 02:19.616
Yes!

02:20.030 --> 02:21.345
Oh, and if you get that,

02:21.476 --> 02:25.254
I can throw in the wild game
sausage trio at half price.

02:26.950 --> 02:27.910
<i>Fine.</i>

02:28.390 --> 02:30.000
<i>Sue was really
kicking butt.</i>

02:30.140 --> 02:32.292
<i>She was a shining beacon
of motivation.</i>

02:32.930 --> 02:35.152
<i>Axl?
Not so much.</i>

02:35.400 --> 02:37.180
Axl, how many times
do I have to say it?

02:37.330 --> 02:39.240
Turn off that TV and
get dressed for school!

02:39.370 --> 02:41.225
It'll take me, like,
two seconds. Chill.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.460
Hey, hey.
Only one to a customer.

02:44.590 --> 02:45.716
It's for Olivia.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.070
I'm sorry, honey.
Who?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.719
Olivia, my girlfriend.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.358
So this girlfriend of yours--
Is she...

02:57.042 --> 02:58.063
here right now?

02:58.260 --> 02:59.906
No.
She's at her house.

03:00.530 --> 03:02.160
So how did this happen?

03:03.620 --> 03:05.160
You're my boyfriend now.

03:05.350 --> 03:05.911
Okay.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.250
Wow, Brick.
That's great!

03:09.370 --> 03:10.690
So this Olivia--
Do you like her?

03:10.830 --> 03:11.904
She says I do.

03:12.090 --> 03:13.680
Is she cute?
Is she nice?

03:13.820 --> 03:15.286
She has a red ribbon
in her hair.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.620
I like red ribbons.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.316
All Heck men
like red ribbons.

03:19.310 --> 03:20.576
Red ribbons.

03:21.010 --> 03:23.328
Ma, we're out of cereal.
You going to the store or what?

03:23.740 --> 03:25.514
Hey. I will go
to the store

03:25.549 --> 03:27.330
when I decide it's time
to go to the store.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.030
Actually, we're almost
out of a lot of stuff.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.225
I'm going after work.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.430
First I gotta go
to the post office.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.430
Then I'm gonna swing by
Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny'S.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.070
They're hosting bridge club,
and they're almost out of scotch.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.799
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.066
I did it.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.098
I sold over $3,000 worth
of cheese and sausage!

03:43.240 --> 03:45.280
Oh! Honey!

03:45.420 --> 03:47.563
- That's great, Sue.
- That's terrific!

03:47.598 --> 03:48.100
Look at you.

03:48.135 --> 03:48.806
I know.

03:49.207 --> 03:51.080
I just have to send
the checks to the company,

03:51.230 --> 03:52.981
and then I am off
to Indianapolis...

03:53.355 --> 03:54.475
the capital!

03:54.510 --> 03:57.210
Oh, honey,
I am so proud of you.

03:57.390 --> 03:59.124
You worked hard,
and it paid off.

03:59.164 --> 04:02.275
And now you get to see close-up
how Indiana state government works.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.425
I know.
It's like a dream!

04:06.450 --> 04:07.287
Damn it, Axl!

04:07.349 --> 04:09.885
I told you, turn off the TV
and get ready for school!

04:09.920 --> 04:11.576
Now the bus is here,
and you're not ready.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.014
Told you, two seconds.
Chill.

04:19.110 --> 04:20.781
How the hell
does he do that?

04:23.220 --> 04:25.750
Now that you're my boyfriend,
you have to buy me ice cream,

04:25.890 --> 04:26.934
tell me I'm pretty

04:27.053 --> 04:29.160
and walk me to and from
recess and lunch.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.854
I made you a list
so you don't forget.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.930
Okay.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.215
The crash rating
on this baby?

04:40.350 --> 04:43.314
Two stars.
Not one, but two.

04:43.420 --> 04:44.379
Out of how many?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.628
Five.
But who cares?

04:46.870 --> 04:48.805
'Cause if you crash,
the doors are so thin,

04:48.806 --> 04:50.308
they will cut you out
like that.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.218
Sue. What are
you doing here?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.770
The school put up a list of
winners for the field trip,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.170
and my name
wasn't on it.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.340
- What?
- Does this car have--

05:02.490 --> 05:04.142
Yeah, yeah, it has everything.
Just give me a minute.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.600
But you were a top seller.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.860
I know.
Can you believe it?

05:10.050 --> 05:12.170
<i>Unfortunately,
I could believe it.</i>

05:12.310 --> 05:14.356
<i>This was Sue's whole life
in a nutshell.</i>

05:14.430 --> 05:16.990
<i>She tries and tries and
never gets any recognition.</i>

05:17.140 --> 05:19.261
<i>It's like
people don't even see her.</i>

05:19.440 --> 05:20.590
Sue Heck?

05:20.770 --> 05:21.606
Here.

05:22.510 --> 05:23.352
Sue Heck?

05:23.960 --> 05:24.693
Here.

05:24.809 --> 05:26.263
Okay. Not here.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.705
Pizza or fish?

05:27.720 --> 05:28.454
Pizza, please.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.831
Oh. Okay.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.210
# Happy birthday to you, #

05:36.430 --> 05:38.948
# Happy birthday to you, #

05:39.100 --> 05:42.320
# Happy birthday dear... #

05:42.590 --> 05:45.097
# Happy birthday to you #

05:47.030 --> 05:50.077
Oh, honey.
That's just not fair.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.260
What's not fair?

05:51.400 --> 05:53.672
Sue sold enough sausage and
cheese to win the big trip,

05:53.707 --> 05:55.200
and she's not
on the list to go.

05:55.350 --> 05:56.845
Oh, those monsters.

05:57.550 --> 05:58.872
I'm gonna
cancel my check.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.413
Looks like I'm not
going to Indianapolis.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.781
I was really
looking forward to it, too.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.586
What are you talking about?

06:07.621 --> 06:09.400
This is just a mistake.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.934
Things like this
happen all the time.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.788
Yes, more often to you,
but we'll straighten it out.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.265
Eh.
It's not worth the fight.

06:19.730 --> 06:22.410
<i>Great. Why do I have to be
the only mom in the world</i>

06:22.445 --> 06:24.651
<i>whose teenager listens
to what they say?</i>

06:26.310 --> 06:29.881
Then Sue turns to me and says,
"Eh, it's not worth the fight."

06:30.760 --> 06:32.610
Well, that's your fault.
She gets that from you.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.910
I said it once!

06:34.050 --> 06:36.229
- You say it all the time!
- I do not!

06:39.730 --> 06:42.020
Hey, we don't wear
flip-flops to church.

06:42.170 --> 06:43.293
Jesus wore sandals.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.320
Eh, it's not
worth the fight.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.658
I'm not paying $6
a month for other fees

06:47.693 --> 06:49.312
unless you can tell me
what those other fees are.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.220
No, don't transfer me
to India.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.560
Don't transfer me--
Eh, it's not worth the fight.

06:55.420 --> 06:58.242
Well, the kids
are asleep, so...

06:58.530 --> 07:01.152
Honey,
I am so exhausted.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.603
Eh, it's not
worth the fight.

07:06.110 --> 07:09.058
And I said it to Mr. Ehlert
right in front of her.

07:09.093 --> 07:10.350
Oh, my God!

07:10.530 --> 07:12.021
Am I a horrible mother?

07:12.220 --> 07:13.346
Too soon to tell.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.830
It's just so unfair.

07:15.990 --> 07:19.844
I mean, for once in her life,
Sue finally wins something, and--

07:20.090 --> 07:22.751
And then that stupid school
has to go and screw it all up.

07:23.170 --> 07:26.070
<i>She</i> earned that trip.
<i>We</i> earned that trip.

07:26.210 --> 07:29.144
Hell, yeah! I'm the one that spent
50 hours in the car with her.

07:29.270 --> 07:32.200
Oh, did you know that her friend
Stacy likes a boy named Ben,

07:32.350 --> 07:34.133
but Ben likes
Stacy's friend Madison,

07:34.168 --> 07:35.550
so now they're not
talking to her?

07:35.690 --> 07:37.453
You want more?
I got lots more.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.000
I have got to fix this.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.070
Sue has
to stand up for herself.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.791
I mean, if this isn't
worth the fight, Mike,

07:42.826 --> 07:43.711
I don't know what is.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.468
Hey, Sue, get in here.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.185
You know what this is?

07:47.403 --> 07:49.170
A teachable moment.

07:49.220 --> 07:52.440
I saw that on "Oprah,"
or "Project Runway" or something.

07:52.475 --> 07:54.594
I don't remember,
but it's teachable.

07:55.460 --> 07:56.570
Am I in trouble?

07:56.810 --> 08:00.120
Sue, I want you to march
into that school,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.290
talk to who's ever in charge
and get yourself on that trip.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.255
I don't know.

08:05.270 --> 08:08.021
Mr. Perez, the teacher,
is kind of weird.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.562
Someone said they saw him
crying in the parking lot.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.915
Doesn't matter.
You can't just be invisible,

08:12.967 --> 08:16.064
so you gotta stand up and
fight for what's yours.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.753
I mean, I don't always do that,
but I've had kids. I'm tired.

08:19.780 --> 08:21.645
And don't be afraid
to stare 'em down.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.829
Wow. Okay.
Got it.

08:26.830 --> 08:27.675
How's this?

08:30.160 --> 08:32.284
You got a little something--
You know what?

08:32.342 --> 08:33.801
Lose the stare.
Just be yourself.

08:34.220 --> 08:35.960
Hey, Brick's girlfriend's here.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.049
Hello, Olivia.
So nice to meet you.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.297
Hi! Can Brick
come out and play?

08:46.780 --> 08:48.574
Hey, Brick?
Your girlfriend's here.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.159
Get out there
and have fun.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.654
I don't want to.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.016
Hey, you're not getting
a lot of offers, bud.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.261
Come on! She's cute.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:06.830 --> 09:08.480
I told you
I'd be here at 3:00.

09:08.610 --> 09:10.149
Why weren't you
waiting outside?

09:10.340 --> 09:12.810
And another thing--make sure
you're free on Saturday.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.089
We have a birthday party.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.520
You forgot, didn't you?!

09:16.650 --> 09:18.510
It's like you don't
hear a word I'm saying.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.660
I hear all the words, Olivia.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.734
All of them.

09:22.218 --> 09:23.455
<i>All of them.</i>

09:23.650 --> 09:25.459
And why do you
whisper to yourself?

09:25.510 --> 09:26.663
It's so annoying!

09:26.950 --> 09:28.807
<i>This was
a big step for Sue.</i>

09:28.880 --> 09:30.946
<i>She was finally
making a stand.</i>

09:31.230 --> 09:33.418
<i>Yep, this girl
was gonna be heard...</i>

09:34.560 --> 09:35.647
<i>Eventually.</i>

09:44.650 --> 09:45.894
M--Mr. Perez?

09:48.300 --> 09:52.330
I sold over $3,000
of cheese and sausage to,

09:52.470 --> 09:55.809
you know, go on
the trip to Indianapolis?

09:56.390 --> 09:57.371
Who are you?

09:57.870 --> 09:59.086
Oh, Sue.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.492
Sue Heck?

10:02.810 --> 10:05.063
I'm in your fifth period
Spanish class?

10:05.550 --> 10:06.561
I don't think so.

10:08.060 --> 10:12.520
Anyway... I sold over $3,000
worth of cheese and sausage to...

10:12.984 --> 10:16.369
You know,
go on the trip to Indianapolis.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.711
Well, good for you, Sandy.
We'll see you on the bus.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.105
Uh, see, that's the thing--
I'm not on the list.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.806
But I sold over--

10:24.920 --> 10:26.266
Okay, I'll look into it.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.253
Really?

10:30.070 --> 10:31.216
Gracias.

10:31.970 --> 10:34.540
Tenga un buena dia.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.956
How do you break up
with a girl?

10:42.590 --> 10:44.279
You sure you want
to break up with that chick?

10:44.530 --> 10:45.737
I mean,
you're kind of a weird dude.

10:45.797 --> 10:46.970
You got a little hottie
that likes you.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.342
I'm sure.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.819
All right. Well,
girls like it you talk to 'em,

10:50.950 --> 10:52.699
so try blowing her off
or something.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.316
How do I do that?

10:54.930 --> 10:55.916
Like this.

11:04.177 --> 11:05.710
Great advice, Axl.

11:05.745 --> 11:08.145
Now I'm married,
and we have a baby!

11:10.190 --> 11:12.580
<i>I really thought
I nailed the Sue thing.</i>

11:12.720 --> 11:14.868
<i>I had taught her
to stand up for herself.</i>

11:15.040 --> 11:17.125
<i>I was so pumped,
I was even making dinner.</i>

11:17.290 --> 11:19.363
<i>Yep, she's lucky
to have me.</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:20.515
I did it.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.339
I talked to Mr. Perez,
and neither one of us cried.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.065
Oh, great!

11:25.500 --> 11:26.550
I did it, Dad.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.686
I was a little bit
scared at first.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.975
Okay, a lot scared...

11:31.320 --> 11:34.340
But I stood my ground and
explained the situation.

11:36.140 --> 11:37.127
And...?

11:38.220 --> 11:40.538
And he said
he'd look into it. Yay!

11:40.840 --> 11:44.050
- Oh! That's great.
- All right! See, there you go.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.050
- You stood up for yourself.
- Yes, good for you.

11:46.110 --> 11:46.934
- Good girl.
- Perfect.

11:46.935 --> 11:48.335
I'm going down there
and talk to that guy.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.121
Wait, Mike,
didn't you hear her?

11:50.156 --> 11:51.125
He said
he would look into it.

11:51.196 --> 11:52.340
He's blowing her off.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.163
I tell people all day long,
"I'll look into it." I never do.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.830
No. We are not
doing this for her.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.737
We are not
helicopter parenting.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.067
<i>"Regis and Kelly."</i>

12:02.250 --> 12:03.890
You saw
how excited she was.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.824
If you go down there,

12:04.874 --> 12:06.605
you're gonna undermine
her self-confidence,

12:06.635 --> 12:09.186
and she will never learn
to fight her own battles.

12:09.370 --> 12:10.981
Look, the trip
is in two weeks.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.346
If we don't hear before then,
we'll step in.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.447
<i>So while I had one kid desperately
trying to get into something,</i>

12:18.830 --> 12:21.218
<i>I had another desperately
trying to get out.</i>

12:21.580 --> 12:22.863
It's her!

12:28.170 --> 12:29.350
Don't make me
go out there.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.940
I'll do any other kind of social
interaction you want me to.

12:32.090 --> 12:35.070
There's this new boy in my class
who eats his boogers.

12:35.210 --> 12:36.326
I bet he'd be my friend.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.407
Anyone, but Olivia.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.369
So if you don't like her,
don't play with her.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.687
I tried!
It's not that easy.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.280
Okay, relax.
I'll take care of it.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.327
Can Brick
come out and play?

12:56.190 --> 12:58.680
Look, Olivia,
Brick asked me to speak to you

12:58.830 --> 13:01.180
because he thinks
you're a very nice girl,

13:01.310 --> 13:02.581
but he's not ready
to get married.

13:02.970 --> 13:06.021
But he wants to remain friends
because he likes you very much.

13:06.330 --> 13:07.367
It's too late.

13:07.416 --> 13:09.373
We're already married
and we have kids.

13:09.730 --> 13:12.372
What God has joined together,
let no man put asunder.

13:13.750 --> 13:14.760
Okay.
How about this?

13:14.910 --> 13:16.883
You're not really married,
and your kids are dolls.

13:17.390 --> 13:18.974
So why don't you
head home,

13:19.013 --> 13:21.076
and Brick will see you
around school, okay, hon?

13:21.822 --> 13:22.444
Nope.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.040
What?

13:24.140 --> 13:27.548
I've put too much time into this
relationship to just walk away.

13:27.770 --> 13:29.376
Well,
I think you have to.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.024
Nope.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.155
You can't keep saying
"nope" to everything.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.550
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.566
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.928
- Yes, I can!
- Okay, that's enough.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.745
I'm not gonna get into this
because I'm the grown-up,

13:37.880 --> 13:39.009
and I don't have to.

13:39.044 --> 13:40.220
I'm sorry
it came down to this,

13:40.221 --> 13:42.437
but, uh,
it's over, okay?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.703
Brick doesn't want
to see you anymore.

13:43.738 --> 13:44.370
Got it?

13:44.540 --> 13:45.170
Nope.

13:45.630 --> 13:46.967
Go home, Olivia.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.105
How ya gonna make me?

13:52.170 --> 13:53.840
Brick, Olivia's here.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.658
Morning.

13:59.050 --> 14:01.566
Trip to Indianapolis is today
and they didn't call.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.623
I was all packed
and everything.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.372
Now I'll never see
the state seal up close.

14:06.610 --> 14:07.309
What?

14:07.520 --> 14:10.721
No, no, no!
You said the trip is next Saturday.

14:10.756 --> 14:12.633
Yeah, it was next Saturday
when I said it.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.827
- Now it's today.
- It's today?

14:15.030 --> 14:16.703
Well, they can't do that.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.388
They said
they'd look into it.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.860
I'm beginning
to think they didn't.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.210
Oh! That's it.
Come on.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.439
Get your stuff.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.055
What time did you say
the bus is leaving?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.040
It's okay, Mom.

14:26.091 --> 14:27.330
They already left.
It's not worth--

14:28.161 --> 14:30.090
Don't you dare say it!

14:30.220 --> 14:33.565
You deserve this, Sue,
'cause you try and try long past

14:33.600 --> 14:34.584
when others would have
stopped trying

14:34.655 --> 14:36.402
and, damn it, you are
going on this trip.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.171
Mom, you're still in pajamas.

14:39.230 --> 14:40.908
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.

14:49.910 --> 14:52.390
Pull the bus over!

14:52.680 --> 14:54.765
<i>Okay, I know
this doesn't look safe</i>

14:54.880 --> 14:56.352
<i>but I have dual air bags...</i>

14:57.350 --> 14:58.295
<i>I think.</i>

15:04.590 --> 15:05.470
Open up!

15:05.800 --> 15:07.738
Y-yes, I am talking to you.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.228
My daughter, Sue Heck,
is supposed to be on this bus.

15:15.530 --> 15:17.015
A-Are--Are those pajamas?

15:17.260 --> 15:18.623
They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.407
I'm sorry.
She's not on the list.

15:20.408 --> 15:21.679
Okay, you want
to take it from here?

15:21.810 --> 15:22.793
And really give it to him.

15:23.410 --> 15:28.740
Um, I sold more than enough cheese
and sausage to be on this trip.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.547
She sold more than enough
to be on this trip.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.080
I demand...
to be on this bus.

15:35.115 --> 15:36.563
She demands!

15:37.160 --> 15:40.500
- I strongly suggest--
- Strongly suggests!

15:40.620 --> 15:41.960
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take it from here.

15:41.995 --> 15:42.884
Good job, though.

15:43.204 --> 15:44.621
I've got your number,
Mr. Perez.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.338
You never had any intention of
"looking into this," now, did you?

15:48.570 --> 15:50.390
For your information,
I called the company,

15:50.391 --> 15:52.300
and they had no record of
Sue Heck selling anything.

15:52.430 --> 15:53.740
That is baloney!

15:53.860 --> 15:57.580
Nobody ever has a record of Sue,
but I was there.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.944
She counted the orders,
we mailed in those checks

15:59.979 --> 16:02.082
and she is getting
on that bus!

16:02.090 --> 16:03.080
Go! Go, go, go!

16:03.220 --> 16:04.687
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.

16:05.100 --> 16:05.930
Oh, okay.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.239
Get back
on that bus, Sue.

16:07.330 --> 16:07.867
Okay.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.490
No.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.406
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

16:12.780 --> 16:15.080
You're gonna penalize this
sweet, innocent young girl

16:15.210 --> 16:18.906
because you and that stupid company
can't get your acts together?

16:19.250 --> 16:21.475
What kind of message are
you sending to our young people--

16:21.600 --> 16:22.880
That hard work
doesn't pay off?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.168
Because that's what
she's hearing, loud and clear.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.948
Yeah, congratulations.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.751
We just lost
another teen to cynicism.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.875
So you gonna let my daughter
get on the bus or not?

16:34.870 --> 16:37.701
Eh, it's not
worth the fight.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.010
<i>Oh, God.</i>

17:11.150 --> 17:14.481
<i>I thought I mailed Sue's envelope,
I really did!</i>

17:15.470 --> 17:17.876
<i>I gotta stop
puttin' crap up there.</i>

17:21.140 --> 17:23.164
I can't do it anymore.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.039
So you're stuck with her.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.448
It's not all bad.
Olivia's got her strong points.

17:28.483 --> 17:30.655
She's... strong.

17:30.730 --> 17:33.149
I know.
She threw a pumpkin at the car.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.717
Hey, if you and this chick
got pretend married,

17:39.752 --> 17:41.125
why don't you just
get pretend divorced?

17:41.390 --> 17:42.942
She said
if we ever broke up,

17:43.024 --> 17:45.667
she'd take half my books
and we'd split the babies.

17:45.950 --> 17:49.010
She'd get Strawberry Shortcake,
and I'd get Rainbow Brite.

17:49.270 --> 17:51.533
I'm not even sure
if Rainbow Brite is mine.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.689
I don't know
what to tell you, Brick.

17:56.380 --> 17:57.997
Women are complicated.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.806
They're not simple and
straightforward like us guys.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.968
Yeah. I only got two thoughts
in my head--driving and sex.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.839
Uh, grades.
I mean driving and grades.

18:08.970 --> 18:12.180
Unfortunately, she's the kind
of girl who won't move on

18:12.310 --> 18:14.976
till she's found some other
poor sucker she can torment.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.161
Oh, yeah.
Olivia called earlier.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.258
She wants you
to buy her lunch tomorrow.

18:26.630 --> 18:27.886
She said it's, uh,
her favorite

18:27.966 --> 18:29.763
and that you would know
what that is.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.987
Oh, God. I don't!

18:35.610 --> 18:37.490
Hey. Sue make it
on the bus?

18:38.950 --> 18:41.534
All right!
That oughta feel good.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.279
Yeah, it does.

18:43.870 --> 18:44.980
Really does.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.441
Yep. She's lucky to have me.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.145
<i>Well, at least
she'd be gone for four days.</i>

18:52.300 --> 18:55.847
<i>Four days is a long time--
plenty of time for forgiveness.</i>

18:56.270 --> 18:57.769
<i>And she did write.</i>

19:10.910 --> 19:12.391
<i>Until finally...</i>

19:14.730 --> 19:18.730
Sue...
I am so, so sorry.

19:18.860 --> 19:21.190
I went to the post office,
but before I could go in,

19:21.320 --> 19:22.192
Aunt Ginny called,

19:22.262 --> 19:23.670
and then Brick
needed more goldfish

19:23.800 --> 19:25.867
and I had a million things
in my head and...

19:25.950 --> 19:28.309
I love you!
I love you so much!

19:28.900 --> 19:30.847
It was a disaster.

19:31.510 --> 19:33.576
Because you forgot
to mail in the envelope...

19:34.400 --> 19:37.510
My name wasn't on
any of the lists!

19:37.670 --> 19:40.460
I had to sleep on the
floor in the hotel.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.030
They didn't have tickets
to any of the museums,

19:43.160 --> 19:45.796
I missed
the state government in action,

19:45.980 --> 19:48.900
and a junior guidance counselor had
to sit outside with me everywhere

19:49.020 --> 19:51.280
because legally,
I couldn't be left alone!

19:51.410 --> 19:53.110
Well, I'm not invisible
to Miss Glover now!

19:53.240 --> 19:54.586
Oh, no.
She hates me!

19:54.860 --> 19:57.040
This is all your fault!

19:57.170 --> 20:00.080
<i>There it was--
Sue found her voice.</i>

20:00.480 --> 20:02.279
<i>And boy, was it loud.</i>

20:02.820 --> 20:04.370
I didn't deserve this!

20:04.500 --> 20:06.878
I <i>strongly</i> suggest...
