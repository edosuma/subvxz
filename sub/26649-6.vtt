WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.367 --> 00:13.733
(yelling)
Let this mother fucking party
begin!

00:14.867 --> 00:17.800
This time we are back
where we belong!

00:17.867 --> 00:19.100
Newcastle!

00:20.833 --> 00:23.267
With our friends...
And family.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.800
How are you?

00:24.867 --> 00:26.500
Yoo-hoo!
(Abbie) Nana!

00:26.567 --> 00:29.133
Doing the things we love!

00:32.167 --> 00:35.133
There'll be some new faces
Hello!

00:35.200 --> 00:37.967
Plenty of old faces.
Ozzie ozzie ozzie!

00:39.633 --> 00:42.000
And one big blast from the past!

00:42.067 --> 00:44.733
Long time no fucking see!

00:44.800 --> 00:46.200
(screaming)

00:46.267 --> 00:49.767
But don't worry
We're still proper rag.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.633
Which means getting inebriated!

00:54.033 --> 00:55.300
You mean mortal?

00:57.367 --> 01:00.000
Lots of fornication.

01:00.067 --> 01:01.333
Shagging you divvy.

01:02.867 --> 01:04.266
Hello!

01:04.333 --> 01:05.867
Lots and lots of mayhem.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.767
(yelling)

01:07.833 --> 01:10.267
(laughter, shrieking)

01:11.033 --> 01:12.900
Fuck off!

01:12.967 --> 01:15.000
(dance music playing)

01:20.100 --> 01:21.633
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:21.700 --> 01:22.800
(cheering)

01:22.867 --> 01:24.567
Gonna be pure fucking better!

01:24.633 --> 01:27.100
(yelling)

01:27.167 --> 01:30.400
I thought you were gonna stay in
bed
with Abbie. It's pointless.

01:30.467 --> 01:34.567
I've always said me and Adam are
friends so what is there not to
get?

01:36.200 --> 01:38.500
THIS is why I don't fancy Adam.

01:38.567 --> 01:43.100
You're always a joker! I can't
fucking have a serious
conversation!

01:43.167 --> 01:44.733
I'm buzzing you made up.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.300
You and him are always
gonna be all right.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.000
What's the point me getting
involved?

01:49.067 --> 01:50.633
She might want what you've got.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.100
Is that cos she's jealous of
our relationship?

01:55.600 --> 01:59.267
If he ever calls me jealous
again,
I'll have something to say about
it.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.000
Me and Sam do argue.

02:01.067 --> 02:05.667
Chloe had a lot on her mind with
Sam
and wanted a night out with me.

02:05.733 --> 02:08.600
I've had enough of Nathan.
I miss my Sam!

02:10.699 --> 02:12.167
Nice one, bestie(!)

02:13.833 --> 02:15.967
I'm totally crackers me like.

02:16.033 --> 02:17.967
I'm preened to perfection.

02:18.033 --> 02:20.800
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.633
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.567
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:26.633 --> 02:29.800
I'm happy go lucky, jack the
lad,
that's me to a T.

02:29.867 --> 02:32.200
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:32.267 --> 02:35.100
What you see is what you get,
bags of fun.

02:35.167 --> 02:38.333
I cannae believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot!

02:38.400 --> 02:40.267
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

02:41.733 --> 02:44.433
# I never ever know

02:44.500 --> 02:48.133
# Which way this is gonna go

02:49.267 --> 02:53.233
# 'Cause you text
You're coming over...

02:54.400 --> 02:56.600
I heard everything!

02:56.667 --> 02:59.367
Nathan!
I pretended to be asleep.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.200
I didn't get much sleep
because I was kept awake

03:02.267 --> 03:05.633
with Chloe and Sam going at it
in the bed next to me.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.433
Then eventually I did fall
asleep.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.833
That's quite cute we made him
fall asleep with sex noises.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.667
I always knew Nathan
was a bit of a perv.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.233
He was watching me and Sam
get hanky panky!

03:16.300 --> 03:18.067
What's going on
between you and Abbie?

03:18.133 --> 03:21.600
I remember one minute,
she chucked a kebab in me face!

03:21.667 --> 03:23.367
(imitates Adam) "In me face!"

03:23.433 --> 03:25.767
The thing is
I've done fuck all wrong,

03:25.833 --> 03:29.300
It's best I avoid her,
especially
if she's got food at hand!

03:29.367 --> 03:32.333
I cannae deal with
confrontation!
I don't like it!

03:32.400 --> 03:36.533
What I think it is, never laugh
at a woman when she's serious.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.567
Aye and that!

03:42.133 --> 03:45.067
I feel like it's us three
that live in the house.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.267
I don't know why none of us
use the double bed!

03:48.333 --> 03:51.133
Chloe's bagsied the double bed
in the room but isn't here.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.200
I'm trying not to get as
involved
in Chloe and Sam's relationship,

03:55.267 --> 03:57.200
but what Sam said did annoy us.

03:57.267 --> 03:59.300
Apparently he said I was
jealous.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.333
Jealous?
Yeah.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.033
Of course I'm not jealous.

04:03.100 --> 04:06.133
I'd never be jealous of me
friend
being happy with her boyfriend.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.333
I have an opinion,
she's me best friend,

04:08.400 --> 04:11.100
and I'm not doing it
to be awful or nasty,

04:11.167 --> 04:14.233
I'm just doing it
because I've been there.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.333
It's sad to think I can't
speak my mind to Chloe.

04:17.399 --> 04:21.600
I hate to see her upset but if I
give
my opinion, I get called
jealous.

04:21.666 --> 04:24.500
You had a lot of drama
last night, Abbie.

04:24.567 --> 04:28.100
We were like this on nights out
and now we don't even speak.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.767
Like, it has changed.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.900
Since I wouldn't let Adam in me
bed

04:31.967 --> 04:35.133
I feel like he's not even
interested
in being friends anymore.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.367
All I wanted was a serious
conversation for him to say,

04:38.433 --> 04:41.367
"Abbie, look, it has gotten
awkward,
it is a bit different."

04:41.433 --> 04:44.233
"Let's nip it in the bud,
let's just be friends again."

04:44.300 --> 04:45.600
But he couldn't do that.

04:45.667 --> 04:48.467
I'm just gonna avoid him
to be honest.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.433
It's awful when someone
laughs in your face,

05:06.500 --> 05:11.033
but Abbie claims she wants to be
friends with Adam and I believe
her,

05:11.100 --> 05:12.467
but she flirts with him!

05:12.533 --> 05:16.433
You can't have your cake and eat
it,
or in this case, kebab.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.167
Abbie, how are you feeling?

05:18.233 --> 05:21.433
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm still a bit pissed off.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.867
As there's tension in the house
today
I've got a great idea for the
girls.

05:25.933 --> 05:28.500
Sod the boys,
they can sort out their own fun.

05:28.567 --> 05:31.733
I want us to have a girlie day.
Amazing.

05:31.800 --> 05:37.333
So we're gonna do something so
sexy.
We're going burlesque dancing.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.967
(cheering)

05:39.033 --> 05:43.100
What a mint idea, it's the
perfect
opportunity to look like a slut,

05:43.167 --> 05:44.533
but not be called one!

05:44.600 --> 05:46.100
Burlesque is like this...

05:47.467 --> 05:48.800
I don't wanna do that!

05:51.133 --> 05:53.800
Good morning, you little
fuckers.

05:53.867 --> 05:55.767
Good morning.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.667
I'm gonna take them out
for a girlie day.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.900
They're going on a girlie day?
Get in!

06:00.967 --> 06:03.233
Me and Adam can fuck off
for lad time!

06:03.300 --> 06:06.100
Because me and my pal here,
we're going to the pub.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.667
Er, boring!

06:07.733 --> 06:10.333
I might even treat myself
to a game of darts.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
Oh(!)

06:16.867 --> 06:20.633
I'm planning a little bit ahead
knowing I have no sex appeal,

06:20.700 --> 06:23.033
I'm gonna wear a top that says
sexy

06:23.100 --> 06:25.033
and hopefully that'll
distract everyone.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.967
We have purple.
Hello.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.567
We have pink.
Hello.

06:28.633 --> 06:30.500
We have yellow...

06:31.700 --> 06:33.900
Oh, and we have black.

06:33.967 --> 06:36.633
It's nice to see
Chloe has made an effort,

06:36.700 --> 06:39.733
despite the fact she looks like
someone from the Addams Family!

06:42.233 --> 06:45.067
All right then, mate.
Cool, mate.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.067
It's great to get the chance
to talk to Sam.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.200
Me and Abbie
aren't in a relationship,

06:58.267 --> 07:02.700
but Sam knows everything about
women,
he's bought a house with her
missus!

07:02.767 --> 07:05.300
Me and her this morning
haven't spoke one word,

07:05.367 --> 07:07.300
I'm a bit, "What the fuck?"

07:07.367 --> 07:10.567
In my opinion, I didn't feel
I done anything wrong.

07:10.633 --> 07:13.867
I've been straight with Abbie
from the beginning, I do fancy
her,

07:13.933 --> 07:17.167
but one minute she's inviting us
into bed, the next pieing us!

07:17.233 --> 07:20.000
I honestly thought she did
overreact with me.

07:20.067 --> 07:23.533
She was flinging kebab at us,
chasing us round the table.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.400
She tried to rugby tackle us!

07:25.467 --> 07:28.467
You done the best thing
by not reacting back. 100%.

07:28.533 --> 07:31.200
Do you want an apology?
I do want an apology.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.233
I just wanna make up with her.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.967
I'll apologise as well cos I was
laughing in her face a bit.

07:37.033 --> 07:39.267
If it was me,
I wouldn't be apologising!

07:39.333 --> 07:43.733
Abbie was out of order and that
was
a perfectly good kebab she
wasted!

07:43.800 --> 07:45.300
You know what'd be good?

07:45.367 --> 07:49.500
If we had that at a games night,
that would be mint cracker!

07:49.567 --> 07:52.900
Get a few of the lads,
get the girls to get their
mates.

07:52.967 --> 07:55.900
I used to have games night
with me granda,

07:55.967 --> 07:58.467
although he did put his back out
playing Twister!

07:58.533 --> 08:02.100
This one, want a pint, what?
Pint of lager no problem.

08:03.267 --> 08:04.400
Oh!

08:04.467 --> 08:07.267
Oh!
Oh for fuck's sake!

08:07.333 --> 08:09.533
(laughs) What you doing?

08:12.667 --> 08:15.467
I dunno why I'm always
left to shut the door.

08:15.533 --> 08:19.367
Hi! Oh I love this! Ya!

08:19.433 --> 08:23.500
Me and the girls are ready.
I wanna get my sexy freak on!

08:23.567 --> 08:26.300
We've come to learn some
burlesque dance moves.

08:26.367 --> 08:29.300
Oh well, you've definitely
come to the right place.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.633
So, who's feeling very sexy
this afternoon?

08:31.700 --> 08:34.866
I am very sexual, these girls
need to get their sex on,

08:34.933 --> 08:37.433
especially this one,
this one and this one.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.900
So it's the art of the tease.
Cock tease?

08:41.967 --> 08:44.633
I love being a cock tease.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.633
And watch it disappear.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.000
I haven't shaved my armpits!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.667
It's good if you were sweating.

08:53.733 --> 08:57.233
We're gonna take this one off
your right hand with your teeth.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.033
Trixie is teaching us
the tricks of the trade

09:00.100 --> 09:04.533
and I feel like starting doing
this
because I'm fucking good at it.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.433
It's the exaggeration,
the eyes and the smile you need.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.733
(Nathan)
It's like taking off a condom.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.733
Oh! (spits)

09:15.333 --> 09:16.833
Oh vagina.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.600
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
You wanna bit of that pussy?

09:20.867 --> 09:23.800
I don't know if I'd be good
being a burlesque dancer,

09:23.867 --> 09:26.900
all this teasing
just makes me wanna shag!

09:29.033 --> 09:31.433
I just have zero sex appeal.
I'm struggling.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.367
As I thought, I was pretty shit.

09:33.433 --> 09:36.533
Thanks, Trixie.
Well done, everyone.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
Thank you, b-bye.

09:38.667 --> 09:42.100
(all) Bye!

09:50.567 --> 09:52.033
Girls?

09:52.100 --> 09:54.533
Girls?
And Nathan. Nathan?

09:54.600 --> 09:57.633
After a couple of pints
I'm well up for a night!

09:57.700 --> 10:00.733
What better way to cut through
the tension than a games night?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.300
About tonight, we've got a plan.
(all) What?

10:03.367 --> 10:06.567
Games night! We get on the
phone,
get a few mates round.

10:06.633 --> 10:09.900
Have a few drinks, then go out.
Won't that be sick?

10:09.967 --> 10:12.767
Yes! Games night,
I love snakes and ladders.

10:12.833 --> 10:13.867
(all speak)

10:13.933 --> 10:16.600
That'll be fucking mint.
Pre-drink house party?

10:16.667 --> 10:18.167
With all our mates.

10:18.233 --> 10:20.200
Adam and Abbie still haven't
talked,

10:20.267 --> 10:23.467
so games night is the perfect
distraction from the tension.

10:34.233 --> 10:38.400
(Nathan) Hopefully there'll be
some
fitty fitties there for you to
pull.

10:38.467 --> 10:42.433
Aye, if there are any
good-looking
mates coming, that'll be a
bonus,

10:42.500 --> 10:45.467
After all, it is games night
and I'd be very game!

10:45.533 --> 10:49.400
Excuse me, I'm looking in the
mirror!
Thank you, bitch!

10:53.100 --> 10:56.100
So, obviously you know the girl
that Adam shagged, Abbie?

10:56.167 --> 10:57.900
(Sophie) Laura.
Yeah.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.300
Laura's coming in.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.200
Abbie's saying she doesn't care
our mate Laura shagged Adam,

11:02.267 --> 11:06.433
she's raging after last night,
so anything could piss her off.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.733
All I'd want is for him to have
a bit of respect and chat with
me.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.700
Yeah, before it all.
I agree, that like, yeah.

11:13.767 --> 11:16.967
For all I care, Adam can buck
Laura
all around the house,

11:17.033 --> 11:20.533
but before he gets jiggy with it
he needs to apologise to me,

11:20.600 --> 11:22.067
for laughing in me face!

11:22.133 --> 11:23.967
If he just starts
cracking onto Laura

11:24.033 --> 11:26.433
it shows how much he cares
about our friendship.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.567
I hope Abbie snaps out this mood
before our party starts.

11:30.633 --> 11:32.500
I tell you something.
What?

11:32.567 --> 11:36.400
I've never ever had a pre-drink
with my friends and then went
out.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.967
This is gonna be
a really good night.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.733
These games are hilarious.

11:41.633 --> 11:43.833
Adam and Laura are already
flirting.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.900
What's going on?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.300
What have I done wrong now?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.133
Geordie Shore, why aye!

11:59.700 --> 11:59.900
.

12:08.733 --> 12:11.100
Everyone, look!
I'm preparing a spread!

12:11.167 --> 12:15.300
Tonight is our games night and
I am the hostess with the
mostess.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.400
I cannot wait for our friends
to arrive and get mortal.

12:18.467 --> 12:22.033
This is not a party without
chicken nuggets and bastard
chips.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.767
Wow!

12:23.833 --> 12:26.667
Oh, my God, Chloe,
this is carb central.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.833
Ten second rule!

12:31.900 --> 12:35.500
One, two, three, four...
(Sophie) Don't tell my friends!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.433
Our guests have arrived!

12:38.500 --> 12:41.000
(shouting)

12:41.067 --> 12:44.500
I was expecting people to turn
up
with board games under their
arms,

12:44.567 --> 12:47.533
but these lot look like
a hen do gone wrong!

12:47.600 --> 12:50.200
(shouting, cheering)

12:51.867 --> 12:53.800
(Adam) Who's this little
cracker?

12:53.867 --> 12:56.000
It's Annie,
the bird I was cracking on!

12:56.067 --> 12:58.400
I didn't know she was
coming tonight, get in!

12:58.467 --> 13:01.067
You all right, darling?
You OK?

13:02.633 --> 13:04.467
(laughter)

13:04.533 --> 13:08.767
Me best mate Hannah's here and
it's
so good to see a friend from
home.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.000
This is Hannah and she's me
second
favourite person in the world.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.600
I love her so much.
She makes us emotional.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.900
(cheering)

13:15.967 --> 13:18.433
Me most favourite
is me mam of course!

13:18.500 --> 13:19.900
(music blaring)

13:19.967 --> 13:22.733
Vegetarian like you.
Are you veggie as well?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.900
I was a vegetarian then I got
mortal
and ate a kebab.

13:25.967 --> 13:29.533
You look gorgeous.
I had half an hour to get ready.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.033
Were you stressing?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.967
Laura's looking fit and me and
Abbie
still haven't spoken,

13:34.033 --> 13:38.667
so between a neck on or getting
a
kebab in me face, it's a nay
brainer!

13:38.733 --> 13:40.033
(laughs)

13:40.100 --> 13:42.867
I don't care about them
getting with each other,

13:42.933 --> 13:45.700
I just want the respect
of him being my friend.

13:45.767 --> 13:48.667
If he gets with her without
having a conversation with me,

13:48.733 --> 13:51.333
he's not taking our friendship
into consideration at all.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.833
I can tell Abbie is
uncomfortable
with the Adam situation,

13:54.900 --> 13:58.567
so we need to play some games
to clear this tension in the
air.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.600
Games night is about to start!

14:01.300 --> 14:02.967
(unclear) and Sophie over there.

14:03.033 --> 14:06.000
So we're gonna play a game of
Tower Block Dares.

14:06.067 --> 14:07.667
Go on, Laura!

14:07.733 --> 14:09.433
(Laura) What's your sexual
fantasy?

14:09.500 --> 14:11.333
(Chloe) Adam!

14:12.700 --> 14:15.800
(Chloe) Adam's cock.
Sex in a hot tub.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.867
(Sam) Tonight's the night!
Do you wanna make it come true?

14:18.933 --> 14:22.133
Great, Adam and Laura
are already flirting

14:22.200 --> 14:24.700
and he's not spoken to me once!

14:24.767 --> 14:28.167
(all) Ready go! Three, two, one!

14:28.233 --> 14:31.567
(shouting and laughter)

14:31.633 --> 14:34.367
(Sam) That's quite big innit?

14:34.433 --> 14:36.633
(Sophie) Go on, Katie!

14:36.700 --> 14:39.167
Games night in this house
wouldn't be right

14:39.233 --> 14:41.667
without a sex position
competition.

14:41.733 --> 14:42.967
(Chloe) Go on!

14:43.033 --> 14:44.800
(shouting and cheering)

14:44.867 --> 14:47.067
Ooh! That's become very rude!

14:47.133 --> 14:48.433
(girls) Human centipede!

14:48.500 --> 14:51.600
Adam's split!
Let's have a look at him.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.133
(laughter)

14:56.500 --> 15:01.167
This is a nightmare! Good job
I've
had me back, sack and crack
waxed.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.833
Look at Abbie! You were fucking
loving that, you dirty bitch!

15:05.900 --> 15:08.367
That's the most action
I've had all week!

15:08.433 --> 15:11.567
Abbie! If you can't arch your
back
anymore than that

15:11.633 --> 15:13.633
I understand why you're single!

15:13.700 --> 15:16.733
(all exclaim)

15:16.800 --> 15:17.900
Faith!

15:17.967 --> 15:20.800
I want to get Faith to get
more involved with people,

15:20.867 --> 15:22.633
but I didn't mean slag people
off!

15:22.700 --> 15:24.067
(Nathan) Cock fight!

15:24.133 --> 15:25.900
(laughter)

15:25.967 --> 15:27.267
(cheering)

15:27.333 --> 15:29.300
Oh, my God!

15:29.367 --> 15:32.267
Suck on that bitch, suck on
that.

15:32.333 --> 15:36.733
These games are hilarious and
it's
so great having our friends
here.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.200
This is the happiest and most
confident I've felt in the
house.

15:40.267 --> 15:43.167
(Chloe) Who's farted?
Probably Abbie.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.833
(Abbie) It's not.
Smelly bitch!

15:45.900 --> 15:48.367
Especially the amount of cheese
she's been eating.

15:48.433 --> 15:50.400
(Abbie) What has gotten into
Faith?

15:50.467 --> 15:54.400
She keeps making digs in front
of me mates and it's out of
order!

15:54.467 --> 15:57.100
It's time to take this
mother fucking party

15:57.167 --> 16:00.067
to the mother fucking club!

16:00.133 --> 16:01.433
(cheering)

16:01.500 --> 16:03.667
(Nathan) Come on, bitches!

16:03.733 --> 16:05.633
Tonight's games night
has been hilarious,

16:05.700 --> 16:08.633
so let's get our friends
and get in the fucking club!

16:14.167 --> 16:16.733
Everyone is in such a good mood,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.167
but dickhead hasn't
acknowledged me all night

16:19.233 --> 16:21.333
and Faith has been digging me
out.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.867
I'm more pissed off now
than I was earlier!

16:28.833 --> 16:31.200
(cheering)

16:31.267 --> 16:33.267
(dance music playing)

16:33.333 --> 16:35.733
(Sam) We've got to the club,
we're all mortal.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.433
It's fucking chocka.
This is gonna be mint!

16:38.500 --> 16:40.933
(dance music playing)

16:46.800 --> 16:50.100
With our friends partying with
us,
it feels like they're the
newbies

16:50.167 --> 16:53.000
and I'm part of the gang for
years,
I'm loving it!

17:08.800 --> 17:11.567
Tonight was meant to be about
everyone coming together,

17:11.633 --> 17:15.433
but Sam and Chloe have already
taken
themselves to their private
booth.

17:17.532 --> 17:19.867
(dance music playing)

17:28.933 --> 17:32.633
Everyone's getting mortal and
the club is absolutely bouncing.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.400
What more could you ask for?

17:34.467 --> 17:37.267
I know one more thing
I wouldn't mind!

17:47.033 --> 17:48.700
(Abbie) I knew this would
happen!

17:48.767 --> 17:52.200
Adam is more interested in
pulling
than he is in our friendship.

17:52.267 --> 17:53.633
I'm not annoyed at Laura,

17:53.700 --> 17:56.700
but I want her to know
why I'm pissed off at Adam.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.900
Shit, Abbie's speaking to Laura,
and the way Abbie is with me,

18:16.967 --> 18:18.900
she's not gonna be
singing me praises.

18:29.033 --> 18:32.000
I don't know what's happening,
but there's only one thing worse

18:32.067 --> 18:36.000
than a girl being pissed off
with ya,
two girls being pissed off with
ya!

18:52.167 --> 18:55.900
If Adam has got half a brain
he'd be apologising to Abbie!

18:55.967 --> 18:57.533
This is gonna end in disaster!

19:10.500 --> 19:12.567
All's Abbie's doing
is shouting in me face!

19:12.633 --> 19:13.900
I've had enough of this!

19:13.967 --> 19:17.667
If she wanted to be me friend,
she wouldn't be cock blocking
us!

19:27.167 --> 19:29.200
Adam has just walked away from
me.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.867
If I wasn't angry before,
then I am now!

19:41.267 --> 19:44.200
Who does Abbie think she is
chucking her drink on me?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.533
She can piss right off!

19:49.900 --> 19:51.800
I don't understand what's going
on!

19:51.867 --> 19:54.033
One minute they're
all over each other,

19:54.100 --> 19:57.133
the next, one's getting swilled,
what the fuck's going on?

20:05.700 --> 20:07.567
Everyone says I need
to get involved,

20:07.633 --> 20:10.000
but as soon as I ask, I get
ignored!

20:14.000 --> 20:17.133
I was a shoo in for some
steamy hot tub action,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.033
but thanks to Abbie,
Laura's left without saying bye.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.133
Looks like I'm gonna be
on me lonesome.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.533
(dance music playing)

20:30.000 --> 20:33.567
Adam isn't the only one
that's upset us tonight,

20:33.633 --> 20:36.267
there's another person
I need to have a word with!

20:46.000 --> 20:49.200
I knew Abbie was being funny.
What have I done wrong now?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.567
Is that what this is about?

21:16.567 --> 21:18.833
As far as I'm concerned,
Faith was showing off.

21:18.900 --> 21:22.533
You don't say those things to a
mate
in front of loads of people.

21:28.533 --> 21:32.000
Shit! Things look like
it's getting really out of hand.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.567
It's time for mother Sophie
to sort things out.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.167
I was having the best night
ever,

21:40.233 --> 21:42.867
and once again, someone's
got a problem with us.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.333
(Nathan)
I don't know what's going on!

21:51.400 --> 21:53.033
Maybe it's time we went home.

22:07.467 --> 22:09.300
(shouting)

22:09.367 --> 22:10.800
(Nathan) Excuse me!

22:11.733 --> 22:13.967
Ow!
I'm sorry, Sam, I didn't mean
that.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.767
I feel like I can't ever
do anything right.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.900
I was trying to
have banter with Abbie.

22:20.967 --> 22:22.967
I didn't think she'd
take it that way.

22:23.033 --> 22:25.300
I wanna go to bed
and not face anyone.

22:34.033 --> 22:35.767
(indistinct)

22:38.567 --> 22:42.033
I had high hopes for tonight
but it has been absolutely shit.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.333
I'm heading to bed.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.400
(growling)

22:47.900 --> 22:50.100
For once, I wasn't
involved in the drama,

22:50.167 --> 22:54.300
so I wanna take my sexy lad to
bed
for some hanky panky.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.200
Urgh, you've got a semi on.

22:58.267 --> 23:01.467
Shut the door! Get out, Nathan!

23:01.533 --> 23:05.767
I'm not being kept awake another
night by Sam and Chloe shagging!

23:05.833 --> 23:07.133
I'm going with the girls.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.400
Tonight's been a disaster,
everyone's gone to bed,

23:11.467 --> 23:14.700
and I'm having a party,
billy no mates on me own.

23:14.767 --> 23:17.267
I feel like I've argued with
half the house,

23:17.333 --> 23:20.000
and my so-called mates
pissed me off and hurt me.

23:26.767 --> 23:30.000
I've got a friend and they need
house sitters in Benidorm.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.100
(cheering)

23:31.167 --> 23:34.733
I wish everything was OK with
Abbie
because I'm actually really
excited.

23:36.433 --> 23:39.367
We're gonna tear Benny a new
one!

23:39.433 --> 23:41.233
(cheering)

23:41.300 --> 23:43.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

23:48.167 --> 23:48.367
.

24:05.267 --> 24:08.667
(Nathan) Feels a bit tense
and frosty this morning.

24:08.733 --> 24:10.767
Do you think?
A little bit.

24:10.833 --> 24:14.667
After Abbie losing the plot at
Faith,
neither of them are talking.

24:14.733 --> 24:18.900
I dunno what's worse, this, or
having
to listen to Sam and Chloe have
sex!

24:22.500 --> 24:25.033
I think I'm gonna make a cup of
tea.

24:25.100 --> 24:27.467
I don't really know
what to say right now.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.767
Just as I thought everything
was going well,

24:29.833 --> 24:31.733
I upset someone AGAIN last
night!

24:31.800 --> 24:33.433
Nathan, you fart in your sleep.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.300
And yous wake up looking like
trolls.
So do you!

24:36.367 --> 24:38.533
Jesus Christ, Abbie,

24:38.600 --> 24:41.467
I thought when everyone said
there was gonna be games night

24:41.533 --> 24:44.400
and everyone invite their
friends,
it'll be the best night ever,

24:44.467 --> 24:46.567
but it went from zero to 100.

24:46.633 --> 24:49.800
I can't believe I fell out with
Adam
and Faith last night.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.533
I do regret losing it,

24:51.600 --> 24:55.000
but I feel they both took the
piss
out of our friendship.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.633
Faith was just being bitchy.
(Abbie) I know.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.333
I can't believe what she said.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.233
It was like,
"No wonder you're single!"

25:01.300 --> 25:04.167
I was like, "You don't have to
say it like that."

25:04.233 --> 25:08.200
Out of everyone, I try make an
effort
and make sure she's all right.

25:08.267 --> 25:12.400
It was a bit of a dig. You need
to
make her aware that upset ya.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.033
The girls just need to talk.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.133
Faith does have her ups and
downs
trying to fit in,

25:17.200 --> 25:19.300
Hopefully it was banter
that went too far.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.600
Then the drama
with Adam in the club.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.367
I think I swilled him.
You did.

25:23.433 --> 25:27.267
All I wanted last night was him
just be man, come over and be
like

25:27.333 --> 25:31.567
"Abbie, I've been distant, I'm
sorry.
It's not been the same with us."

25:31.633 --> 25:33.700
"Let's put it behind us
and be friends."

25:33.767 --> 25:36.700
I think all he wanted
was a shag from Laura,

25:36.767 --> 25:39.733
and he was thinking with his
dick
rather than his head.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.133
I didn't have a problem
with Adam wanting Laura,

25:42.200 --> 25:45.033
I wanted him to apologise for
being rude the night before,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.800
but now things are awkward
I don't think we can ever get
back

25:48.867 --> 25:50.400
to the way we were before.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.233
Today's a new day.
It is.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.233
We need a happy house.
Yeah.

25:56.967 --> 26:00.900
That was mad last night, wasn't
it?
Mate, last night was a lot!

26:00.967 --> 26:02.233
Think how I felt!

26:02.300 --> 26:06.867
I can't for the life of me work
out
why Abbie did that reaction!

26:06.933 --> 26:08.867
I feel sorry for Adam this
morning.

26:08.933 --> 26:11.633
No matter what,
he doesn't deserve to get
swilled.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.500
Him and Abbie aren't even
together!

26:13.567 --> 26:16.333
You still hadn't
sorted things out with her,

26:16.400 --> 26:18.667
and you were still
interested in pulling.

26:18.733 --> 26:22.167
She thinks your friendship's
a lot more important than
pulling.

26:22.233 --> 26:25.233
Maybe I didn't realise how much
Abbie thought of our friendship,

26:25.300 --> 26:29.767
and maybes I do need to sort
things,
but she did cock block us!

26:29.833 --> 26:34.700
It's gonna be very,
very awkward today!

26:37.167 --> 26:39.433
How are you feeling about last
night?

26:39.500 --> 26:43.333
I feel no matter what I do,
I can never do anything right.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.633
It really surprised us
Abbie and Faith fell out last
night.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.333
They've been getting really
close.

26:48.400 --> 26:52.000
With you, I think you're young,
sometimes you misjudge things.

26:52.067 --> 26:54.633
You might say the wrong thing
at the wrong time,

26:54.700 --> 26:56.733
which isn't bad,
it's a learning curve.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.367
I did think because me and Abbie
have been bonding so much,

27:00.433 --> 27:02.900
I did think I could
banter like that,

27:02.967 --> 27:05.500
but obviously it was took
the wrong way.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.000
So, I will definitely
be apologising to her.

27:08.067 --> 27:11.133
I was so buzzing to have
me mate from home last night,

27:11.200 --> 27:14.533
I think I got too excited
and messed things up again.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.633
I just wanna make things right
and
get back to having fun in the
house.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.100
(wretches)

27:22.167 --> 27:23.400
(Faith laughs)

27:23.467 --> 27:26.067
That is straight up vodka.
(retches)

27:34.633 --> 27:36.233
(Anna) Hello?

27:36.300 --> 27:37.767
Oh great!

27:37.833 --> 27:40.533
As if today couldn't get any
worse!
Here's Anna!

27:40.600 --> 27:42.700
Guys!
Come on, guys!

27:42.767 --> 27:43.867
Anna's here!

27:43.933 --> 27:46.733
(Chloe) Anna's not the boss,
it's Scott.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.133
Where's Scotty?
Has he finally been fired?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.767
Or have we done something
REALLY bad?

27:52.833 --> 27:56.600
I've got a friend who has a
property
and they need house sitters.

27:56.667 --> 28:00.667
Anna best not be sending us on
some shite job with this
hangover.

28:00.733 --> 28:04.633
The only thing is,
the house is in Benidorm.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.900
(cheering)

28:08.033 --> 28:09.833
Get in, Anna, you little beauty!

28:09.900 --> 28:14.233
I take all them bad things I've
said
about you back, for the time
being!

28:14.300 --> 28:16.700
Scott has gave me...

28:16.767 --> 28:19.700
...this to give to ya
while yous are away.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.467
What's that?
It's for the rats.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.100
Scott said he'd feed Donald and
Theresa while you're away.
Really?

28:25.167 --> 28:27.167
Is Anna fuckin' rag?

28:27.233 --> 28:29.700
Scotty T looking after my
babies?

28:29.767 --> 28:31.933
They're me own!
They're like me child!

28:32.000 --> 28:35.133
Now yous have got a flight to
catch,
so get packing.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.967
Yes!
OK.

28:37.033 --> 28:40.067
Enjoy Benidorm, bye-bye!
(Chloe) Thank you!

28:40.133 --> 28:42.667
I've got something to tell ya.
What is it?

28:42.733 --> 28:45.900
Me nana is only in Benidorm...

28:45.967 --> 28:47.500
...having a holiday!

28:47.567 --> 28:52.300
So I think it's only right if we
have a little catch up with her.

28:52.367 --> 28:57.067
If one person can take my mind
off
all of this crap, it's me nana,

28:57.133 --> 28:59.833
even at 64, she's more rag
than all of us.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.367
Well, go on then, Cinderella.

29:02.433 --> 29:05.167
Let's get the fuck up them
stairs
and get packing,

29:05.233 --> 29:08.000
because I wanna get myself
to Benidorm!

29:09.467 --> 29:11.267
Hey!

29:11.333 --> 29:13.767
We're going to fucking Benidorm!

29:17.333 --> 29:19.933
(Nathan) This one...
(Adam) Them are rascal, them.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.533
This two-piece.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.700
And then, finally this
two-piece.

29:24.767 --> 29:26.633
Me and the lads are packing.

29:26.700 --> 29:29.800
I've gotta make sure I've got
my best outfits for Benny,

29:29.867 --> 29:33.167
because everyone loves
a lovely ensemble!

29:33.233 --> 29:36.600
It is a bit frosty
this morning in the house,

29:36.667 --> 29:39.933
but a change of scenery,
a bit of sun,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.333
a little sangria,
might cheer everyone up!

29:46.867 --> 29:48.300
(Chloe) Benidorm!

29:48.367 --> 29:50.133
(cheering)

29:53.100 --> 29:54.733
Off to fucking Benny!

29:54.800 --> 29:56.067
(shrieking)

29:56.133 --> 30:00.467
We're packing and I'm proper
buzzing
like one of Sophie's sex toys.

30:00.533 --> 30:05.500
Bringing it for your nana!
Nana, here we come!

30:05.567 --> 30:07.600
I wish everything was OK with
Abbie,

30:07.667 --> 30:10.567
but right now doesn't feel like
the right time to chat,

30:10.633 --> 30:12.633
cos I'm actually really excited!

30:12.700 --> 30:14.667
I've never been abroad
without me mam!

30:14.733 --> 30:16.333
I feel like such an adult!

30:16.400 --> 30:19.433
# Whoa whoa-oh-oh-oh

30:19.500 --> 30:21.600
# Whoa-oh-oh-oh

30:21.667 --> 30:23.467
# Whoa-oh-oh-oh...

30:23.533 --> 30:24.967
Up the Benny!

30:25.033 --> 30:28.033
We're packed and ready to go.
Let's get on the road.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.933
# Whoa-oh-oh-oh

30:31.000 --> 30:33.033
# Whoa-oh-oh-oh...

30:33.100 --> 30:35.733
(all shouting) Benny! Benny!
Benny!

30:38.767 --> 30:41.233
(engines roaring, brakes
squealing)

30:44.567 --> 30:47.067
(Sophie) I'm fucking raving,
mate!

30:47.133 --> 30:50.767
(cheering and chanting)

30:50.833 --> 30:52.700
We are in Benidorm!

30:54.500 --> 30:57.700
(yells) Fucking Benidorm!

30:57.767 --> 31:00.433
I bloody love Benidorm!
It's so picturesque.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
Mount Kilimanjaro's on Benidorm.

31:02.567 --> 31:05.100
Mount Kilimanjaro's in Africa.
Is it?

31:05.167 --> 31:08.700
We're driving up this mountain
road
and there's this posh-looking
villa.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.800
If it gets further up, it'll be
higher than a giraffe's hat!

31:16.033 --> 31:17.533
Come on, guys!

31:17.600 --> 31:20.167
Wow, lads, wow!
Fuck me, I'm loving this!

31:20.233 --> 31:22.100
(girls) Benny! Benny!

31:24.200 --> 31:27.600
Oh, my God! It's like a jungle!

31:27.667 --> 31:29.567
(Sophie) Oh, my God!

31:29.633 --> 31:32.800
(Chloe) This is the most
incredible villa I have ever
seen.

31:32.867 --> 31:35.867
Anna has done a canny good job.
Get up, Anna!

31:35.933 --> 31:38.400
Oh, my God yous, what the fuck?

31:39.633 --> 31:41.167
(yelling)

31:41.233 --> 31:43.967
Fuck me! This villa is
unbelievable!

31:44.033 --> 31:46.233
Who lives in here? Tom Cruise?

31:46.300 --> 31:49.500
There's more than one floor!
There's three floors!

31:49.567 --> 31:51.767
(Adam) Come on, Nathan get on!

31:51.833 --> 31:53.900
(Sam) Come on you dirty bastard.

31:55.867 --> 31:59.233
This is my room.
Bagsy this one! Memory foam!

31:59.300 --> 32:03.767
If Chloe actually ends up
sharing
a bed with me, I'll eat me
knickers.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.267
Yous I've got a note!

32:09.333 --> 32:12.933
Anna's mate left us a long list
of things to do, but in Spanish!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.333
I don't know Spanish!

32:14.400 --> 32:18.100
"Claudia la Casa."
Casa means villa, casa means
villa!

32:18.167 --> 32:19.767
We're there!
Look in the dictionary.

32:19.833 --> 32:22.367
Don't hand Sam the dictionary!

32:22.433 --> 32:25.433
He can barely speak English
let alone Spanish!

32:25.500 --> 32:28.933
Flor is flower, so flores is
flowers.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.067
Right?

32:30.133 --> 32:34.100
So basically, we need to look
after
the house and look after the
plants.

32:34.167 --> 32:37.700
Is Anna having a laugh?
This is gonna be a piece of
piss!

32:37.767 --> 32:41.200
Fuck it! We're in Benidorm
We're gonna get fucking...

32:41.267 --> 32:42.600
(cheering)

32:42.667 --> 32:45.433
Fuck talking to plants,
we're gonna hit the strip

32:45.500 --> 32:47.233
and tear Benny a new one!

32:47.300 --> 32:48.800
(cheering)

32:52.200 --> 32:54.800
Up the fucking Benny!

32:55.500 --> 32:57.000
(Sophie) Benny is banging...

32:57.067 --> 33:00.867
but the night could be going so
much
better if everyone was talking!

33:00.933 --> 33:02.533
Still getting jealous are ya?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.433
How way, kid! How way, kid!

33:04.500 --> 33:07.033
Shit, Sophie's actually
lost it with Sam!

33:07.100 --> 33:09.067
Do I?
Stop it, stop it now!

33:09.133 --> 33:11.700
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

33:16.667 --> 33:16.867
.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.033
(electronic music playing)

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
Get out!

33:29.667 --> 33:32.633
It's our first night in Benidorm
so we need to get out

33:32.700 --> 33:34.867
and see what this Spanish beauty
has to offer!

33:34.933 --> 33:37.133
(farts, guys laugh)

33:39.133 --> 33:41.733
(indistinct banter)

33:44.100 --> 33:45.633
What happened?

33:45.700 --> 33:48.667
Did that go back inside?
No, because that's a poo.

33:48.733 --> 33:52.833
Things are still awkward because
I've not spoken to Adam or
Faith,

33:52.900 --> 33:56.100
but no doubt after a few drinks,
it will all come out.

33:56.167 --> 33:57.800
What's happening?
Hello, lads!

33:57.867 --> 34:01.900
Yous look absolutely lovely.
Ready for the night! Riff raff!

34:01.967 --> 34:04.167
Go on then!
To the riff!

34:04.233 --> 34:06.167
(all) To the raff!

34:06.233 --> 34:08.333
I really hope there's
no drama tonight.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.233
Our first night in Benidorm
needs to be epic,

34:11.300 --> 34:13.266
so let's hit the strip!

34:13.333 --> 34:15.567
(dance music playing)

34:21.400 --> 34:25.967
We've arrived at the club
and I wouldn't expect anything
less,

34:26.033 --> 34:29.000
this is Benidorm at its finest.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.733
(cheering)

34:31.800 --> 34:36.132
(dance music playing)

34:36.199 --> 34:39.333
I'm actually ashamed that I've
never
been to Benidorm before.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.867
This club is fucking wild.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.967
(dance music blaring)

35:05.033 --> 35:06.233
Benny is banging,

35:06.300 --> 35:09.833
but the night could be going so
much
better if everyone was talking!

35:20.633 --> 35:22.500
Faith is used to apologising by
now.

35:22.567 --> 35:26.100
She needs to get a wriggle on
so we have a good night in
Benny.

35:36.133 --> 35:39.233
(sighs) All right, here it goes.

35:42.600 --> 35:46.100
Remember, think before you
speak.
Don't fuck it up!

36:05.600 --> 36:08.167
I'm so glad Faith has came over
and apologised.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.533
She must still find it hard
to fit in.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.667
I wanna get back on track
with everyone.

36:17.767 --> 36:22.133
What a relief, I was so worried
that
I'd messed everything up with
Abbie.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.133
Without her,
I don't know what I'd do.

36:27.967 --> 36:30.800
(dance music playing)

36:30.867 --> 36:34.300
There's nothing I love more
than being in a hot country

36:34.367 --> 36:37.300
getting mortal in a club
with my sexy arse girlfriend.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.800
Right, I need to speak to Abbie
and sort everything out.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.433
We need to have this chat.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.000
Whatever you do, Adam,
don't fucking laugh, don't
laugh!

37:05.667 --> 37:08.267
This is all I wanted
Adam to do last night.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.533
He is me mate and good craic.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.500
I wanna put all this behind us
and have a good trip.

37:18.900 --> 37:22.200
(dance music blaring)

37:29.033 --> 37:31.867
It looks like Abbie has made up
with Faith and Adam,

37:31.933 --> 37:35.100
so I'm gonna help her
have a glorious neck on.

37:45.833 --> 37:47.967
I think I've found her
a winner winner,

37:48.033 --> 37:50.233
chicken fucking nugget dinner!

37:53.267 --> 37:55.200
(cheering)

37:57.167 --> 37:58.833
Well, I am on holiday!

38:06.533 --> 38:09.433
Me and Abbie might've made up
but I'm in the friendzone,

38:09.500 --> 38:11.333
as she pulled a lad straight
away!

38:19.833 --> 38:23.033
I'm having such a laugh with
everyone, Benidorm is unreal.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.867
It's such a shame
we're all here in Benidorm,

38:38.933 --> 38:41.567
but they keep separating
themselves on nights out,

38:41.633 --> 38:43.233
it's starting to piss me off.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.867
(dance music continues)

38:53.000 --> 38:54.467
Tonight has been mint!

38:54.533 --> 38:58.300
I've enjoyed spending time with
Chloe
but Abbie's absolutely mortal.

38:58.367 --> 39:01.233
Time to go to the villa
and carry on the fun.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.567
Everyone, let's go!

39:05.933 --> 39:09.533
(Nathan) Sophie! Sophie!
Come with us.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.800
(Chloe) Hello! What about me?
I don't know what's going on!

39:12.867 --> 39:15.800
But I'm getting weird vibes
from Sophie and Nathan.

39:15.867 --> 39:18.133
It's me and you then.
When yous going?

39:19.333 --> 39:20.767
Ah. Fuck.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.567
(Abbie singing) Benny! Benny!
Benny! Ben-a-fucking-dorm.

39:30.633 --> 39:32.967
Abbie has been well and truly
Benidormed!

39:33.033 --> 39:36.000
Yous, wait there,
Abbie's turned into her nana!

39:36.067 --> 39:37.167
(laughter)

39:40.267 --> 39:43.633
(Sophie) We get back to our
posh villa and we are mortal.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.700
Me and Nathan are gonna
serve up some pizza.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.367
Let's see if we can be
sophisticated!

39:49.433 --> 39:51.067
Whoa!

39:52.233 --> 39:53.233
(Nathan) Chloe!

39:53.300 --> 39:55.900
Wow, Chloe seems
pretty mortal as well.

39:55.967 --> 39:59.767
Where is the pizza? Oh my
nipple!
Fucking broke the rules already.

39:59.833 --> 40:01.367
I need a pizza!

40:01.433 --> 40:03.967
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!
Where's the fucking pizza?

40:04.033 --> 40:06.233
Wait! Will you wait you drunk
bitch?

40:06.867 --> 40:08.567
Go on down here! Hello, hello!

40:08.633 --> 40:10.800
Chloe, just give me a second!

40:10.867 --> 40:13.867
I've got other people to feed
other than your greedy arse!

40:16.133 --> 40:17.767
People down here, hello.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.867
Chloe, we need to cut them
first!
I'll pass them down.

40:20.933 --> 40:22.633
Sorry! Everyone's asking,
not just me.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.033
You're trying to throw
shady digs there.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.700
I was looking directly at
Sophie.
Sorry.

40:28.767 --> 40:31.500
I said nowt.
You were speaking to me?

40:31.567 --> 40:32.900
What about me?

40:32.967 --> 40:35.533
...speaking to you and he said,
"Pass the pizza."

40:35.600 --> 40:36.967
Then he's saying that!

40:37.033 --> 40:39.333
Why are Nathan and Sophie
getting at us?

40:39.400 --> 40:41.200
They've been off with us, now
this?

40:41.267 --> 40:44.433
Don't get upset over a pizza.
I am getting upset!

40:44.500 --> 40:47.533
(indistinct)
...and said "Pass the pizza."

40:47.600 --> 40:50.967
I really don't like the fact my
girlfriend is sitting here
crying!

40:51.033 --> 40:52.867
Come on, there's worse things...

40:52.933 --> 40:56.100
People are dying in the world!
I'm not fucking crying over
pizza!

40:56.167 --> 40:58.867
What you saying, baby?
Why you calling us "baby"?
Weird.

40:58.933 --> 41:01.200
Is it?
Why are you calling me "baby"?

41:01.267 --> 41:03.433
Isn't that what you call
your girlfriend? 'Course.

41:03.500 --> 41:06.033
Why you calling me "baby"?
Still getting jealous, are ya?

41:07.400 --> 41:11.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sam did not
just call me jealous again!

41:11.400 --> 41:13.633
Jealous of what?
Sam!

41:13.700 --> 41:15.533
(Sophie) I mean, right.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.400
I am mortal,

41:17.467 --> 41:20.800
and even I know calling Sophie
jealous is not a good idea.

41:20.867 --> 41:25.167
I tell you fucking something,
kid,
one thing I'm not is jealous of
you.

41:25.233 --> 41:28.467
Chloe, are you gonna have my
back?
What you on about jealous?

41:28.533 --> 41:31.200
Sam has pissed me off
one too many times recently

41:31.267 --> 41:34.300
and her letting her boyfriend
talk to me like that

41:34.367 --> 41:38.000
has really wound me up,
and I can feel meself losing it.

41:38.067 --> 41:41.900
Howay kid, howay, kid!
I'll fucking take a...
(indistinct)

41:41.967 --> 41:43.967
Howay, then! Howay, kid!

41:44.033 --> 41:46.167
Open up right fucking...
(Nathan) Sophie!

41:46.233 --> 41:49.400
Did she just hit us?
Think I'm fucking jealous of
you?

41:49.467 --> 41:52.033
Shit! Sophie's actually
lost it with Sam.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.333
Stop it, stop it now.
No, daft cunt.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.767
What the hell's going on? Sophie
is
bang out of order hitting Sam!

41:57.833 --> 42:01.100
Think I'm fucking jealous? Sam?
Get in, get in!

42:01.167 --> 42:02.500
I knew things weren't right,

42:02.567 --> 42:05.867
but hitting me boyfriend and
shouting at me is out of order!

42:05.933 --> 42:07.333
Four years I've known you,

42:07.400 --> 42:11.033
and your boyfriend's speaking to
me,
your best mate like that!

42:11.100 --> 42:12.633
Sophie shouldn't have hit Sam,

42:12.700 --> 42:17.467
but I feel there's a massive
divide
between us and Chloe and I hate
it.

42:17.533 --> 42:19.800
We're your best friends!
Come on.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.567
That's more drama than
I'm used to in this house,

42:29.633 --> 42:32.167
but I'm so glad me and Abbie
are friends again.

42:32.233 --> 42:35.500
Get your water down ya.
OK.

42:40.467 --> 42:43.400
We're supposed to be having
the best time of our lives

42:43.467 --> 42:45.300
and I don't understand
what happened!

42:45.367 --> 42:47.900
I'm stuck between me boyfriend
and friends once again.

42:54.433 --> 42:56.500
That turned nasty really
quickly.

42:56.567 --> 43:00.800
I can't believe I hit Sam
and I fell out with me best
mate.

43:00.867 --> 43:01.967
Shit man.

43:02.033 --> 43:06.067
# When they love you
I love you more #

43:06.133 --> 43:07.767

43:07.833 --> 43:10.367
I fucking love my nana.

43:10.433 --> 43:12.233
(cheering)

43:12.300 --> 43:13.467
Fancy some champas?

43:13.533 --> 43:15.733
(woman on mobile)
I expect better from you!

43:15.800 --> 43:18.933
I feel so bad.
I don't know what got into us.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.967
There's a big fucking elephant
in this room!

43:21.033 --> 43:23.400
Sam, I'd like to apologise
for last night.

43:23.467 --> 43:25.900
Oh! Dirty bastard.

43:25.967 --> 43:27.233
(wretches)

43:28.567 --> 43:30.167
Nana, you little minx, ya!

43:30.233 --> 43:32.733
To the family!
(all) To the family!
