00:29.211 --> 00:31.710
Hold on, Softboy.

00:31.711 --> 00:33.476
Robbery at First National Bank.

00:33.477 --> 00:34.710
Guard shot and killed.

00:34.711 --> 00:35.976
Suspects armed.

00:41.711 --> 00:44.676
Help me, man. I'm bleeding out here.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.210
Don't worry, Softboy. I got this.

00:46.211 --> 00:49.510
Get us the hell out of here, man!

01:09.811 --> 01:10.843
We lost them.

01:12.944 --> 01:14.243
Careful!

01:14.244 --> 01:15.476
Slow down!

01:15.477 --> 01:16.810
Shit!

01:19.877 --> 01:21.310
Where's the road?

01:21.311 --> 01:23.043
Oh, shit!

01:36.177 --> 01:38.176
Softboy! Help!

02:52.344 --> 02:54.176
That hairline going toward the south.

02:54.177 --> 02:57.043
Gonna end up in Mexico.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.810
It's called "gently receding."

02:59.811 --> 03:01.443
It's called "disappearing."

03:01.444 --> 03:03.910
Well, my brain's growing...

03:03.911 --> 03:05.510
Growing weeds.

03:05.511 --> 03:07.276
'Cause of all that
thinking I've been doing.

03:07.277 --> 03:08.843
Thinking 'bout what?

03:08.844 --> 03:11.976
All the money you gon' save on shampoo?

03:11.977 --> 03:14.343
Thinkin' about how you talk too much.

03:18.211 --> 03:20.843
Hey, you two. End of the day.

03:20.844 --> 03:23.176
Collect your pay. You're done.

03:23.177 --> 03:25.410
- On account of what?
- On account of cheaper labor.

03:25.411 --> 03:27.843
Farm south of here went under.

03:27.844 --> 03:29.810
Whole batch of Mexicans just rolled in.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.176
Christmas came early.

03:34.177 --> 03:36.877
Send in the Mexicans!

03:45.011 --> 03:47.110
God damn it!

03:47.111 --> 03:49.543
- Leonard...
- Shit!

03:49.544 --> 03:52.010
Well, that sucks.

03:52.011 --> 03:54.576
So many kinds.

03:54.577 --> 03:56.810
Regular's cheaper.

03:56.811 --> 03:58.010
Bottom shelf.

03:58.011 --> 03:59.810
Oh.

03:59.811 --> 04:02.643
Cleanup on aisle four.

04:02.644 --> 04:04.710
Those aren't cheap.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.576
You can take a man's job, but
you can't take his cookies.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.411
You doing coupons now?

04:17.543 --> 04:19.911
Don't look at me. He's the domestic one.

04:22.244 --> 04:23.877
You got 2 bucks?

04:30.911 --> 04:33.976
Thank you, miss.

04:33.977 --> 04:36.376
Well, go on. Go get the car, Rochester.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.243
Oh, yes, sir, Massa Hap.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.976
I'll go right away.

04:39.977 --> 04:41.643
You like me to give you
a bath while you...

04:41.644 --> 04:43.243
No, no, no. Thank you. Go on.

04:43.244 --> 04:44.776
- 'Cause I'll do it now.
- Get out of here.

04:44.777 --> 04:47.210
Okay, Massa. I'll wash your feet, Massa.

04:47.211 --> 04:50.276
It is so hard to get
good help these days.

04:50.277 --> 04:52.510
Oh...

05:48.277 --> 05:49.710
Pull.

05:54.511 --> 05:56.576
You ever miss?

05:56.577 --> 05:58.077
Just on purpose.

06:07.277 --> 06:09.911
Oh, boy. Here comes trouble.

06:11.211 --> 06:13.843
Can you be nice for once?

06:13.844 --> 06:15.310
You just watch her.

06:15.311 --> 06:17.143
I'm watching.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.110
That's not what I'm talking about.

06:19.111 --> 06:21.643
She does it again, don't
come crying to me.

06:21.644 --> 06:22.843
I look like a fool to you?

06:22.844 --> 06:24.443
And then some.

06:24.444 --> 06:26.043
You just remember:

06:26.044 --> 06:28.676
a stiff dick ain't got no conscience.

06:28.677 --> 06:30.611
Hey, Hap.

06:32.544 --> 06:35.376
Hey.

06:35.377 --> 06:36.443
Leonard.

06:36.444 --> 06:38.744
Trudy.

06:40.877 --> 06:42.343
Check up on you later.

06:42.344 --> 06:44.277
Remember what I said.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.143
He mad about something?

06:55.144 --> 06:57.410
He doesn't like you.

06:57.411 --> 06:58.743
I forgot.

06:58.744 --> 07:01.044
No, you didn't.

07:03.177 --> 07:05.176
Been a while, huh?

07:05.177 --> 07:06.376
Hmm.

07:06.377 --> 07:09.043
I wanted to look good.

07:09.044 --> 07:10.343
You do.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.310
Jazzercise.

07:12.311 --> 07:15.110
I got myself a video,
and I do what it says.

07:15.111 --> 07:17.343
Us older ladies have to work at it.

07:17.344 --> 07:19.876
Well, it's working.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.043
So you want something?

07:26.044 --> 07:27.576
Got any coffee?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.277
Mm-hmm.

07:30.744 --> 07:33.110
Should we go up to the house?

07:33.111 --> 07:35.077
That's where the coffee's at.

07:50.111 --> 07:53.077
You still working the rose fields?

07:54.411 --> 07:57.310
It's honest work.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.010
You deserve better.

08:00.011 --> 08:03.210
What're you gonna do when
you're too old for it?

08:03.211 --> 08:05.443
You sound like Leonard.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.076
Maybe he's smarter than I think.

08:07.077 --> 08:09.144
Oh, he is.

08:10.444 --> 08:12.010
Why's he hate me so much?

08:12.011 --> 08:15.010
Well, it was 20 years ago...

08:15.011 --> 08:18.310
But I think him joining up for the war

08:18.311 --> 08:20.076
and then you giving him hell for it

08:20.077 --> 08:21.610
had something to do with it.

08:21.611 --> 08:23.776
I still think he was wrong.

08:23.777 --> 08:25.810
If no one would fight,
there'd be no wars.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.876
How's...

08:35.876 --> 08:36.976
What's his name?

08:36.977 --> 08:38.443
Howard.

08:38.443 --> 08:40.076
Howard.

08:40.077 --> 08:43.775
I don't think I'm cut out for marriage.

08:43.777 --> 08:47.276
I had you, and I screwed
that up, didn't I?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.276
It was no great loss.

08:49.277 --> 08:51.476
I left you for Pete and Pete for Bill

08:51.477 --> 08:54.676
and Bill for Howard.

08:54.677 --> 08:56.476
We got divorced a year ago.

08:56.477 --> 08:57.776
Oh.

08:57.777 --> 09:01.843
Maybe I ought to grow up.

09:01.844 --> 09:07.043
Relationships are all
about trust, I hear.

09:07.044 --> 09:09.010
I trust you.

09:23.544 --> 09:25.710
I've missed you, Hap.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.376
It's been a long time.

09:36.411 --> 09:39.543
Remember that summer

09:39.544 --> 09:43.343
when we would dance till
the roadhouse closed?

09:43.344 --> 09:46.543
Fool around in the back of your car

09:46.544 --> 09:48.843
underneath the stars?

09:48.844 --> 09:50.443
I wasn't fooling.

09:50.444 --> 09:52.510
Neither was I.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.343
Huh.

10:47.344 --> 10:49.310
Is that for me?

10:54.977 --> 10:58.476
Oh, that's not fair.

10:58.477 --> 10:59.810
Nothing is, sugar.

11:30.344 --> 11:32.443
- Yeah?
- She still there?

11:32.444 --> 11:33.643
Yeah.

11:33.644 --> 11:36.210
Shit.

11:36.211 --> 11:38.476
Well, nice knowing you, brother.

11:38.477 --> 11:41.643
A hard dick knows no conscience.

11:41.644 --> 11:43.843
A wise man once told me that.

11:43.844 --> 11:46.143
Bullshit. It always mean more to you.

11:46.144 --> 11:47.543
This is Leonard you're talking to,

11:47.544 --> 11:49.376
not some rose field nigger.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.543
'Cept you are a rose field nigger.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.943
And so am I.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.610
A white one.

11:56.611 --> 12:00.043
What you doing up so late,
minding my business?

12:00.044 --> 12:03.710
Trying to get drunk.

12:03.711 --> 12:05.810
She gonna dump you again, you know?

12:05.811 --> 12:07.710
You listening to Roy?

12:09.944 --> 12:11.576
That's not good.

12:11.577 --> 12:13.343
Not when you're drinking, buddy.

12:13.344 --> 12:15.210
She still talking that hippie shit?

12:15.211 --> 12:18.543
People change, Leonard.

12:18.544 --> 12:19.810
Wow...

12:19.811 --> 12:21.543
Like the '60s, man. Neat.

12:21.544 --> 12:23.743
I was there too, Hap.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.676
It was just the '80s
with tie-dyed T-shirts.

12:25.677 --> 12:26.910
Now, don't fall for it.

12:26.911 --> 12:30.510
No. Nothing to fall for.

12:30.511 --> 12:31.676
Just getting laid.

12:31.677 --> 12:33.143
Yeah.

12:33.144 --> 12:34.676
Guess every time you take a shit...

12:34.677 --> 12:36.443
come out smelling like lollipops too,

12:36.444 --> 12:40.010
you dumb son of a bitch.

13:03.711 --> 13:04.776
Leave it.

13:04.777 --> 13:08.710
It looks good.

13:08.711 --> 13:12.076
I'm starting to look like my dad.

13:12.077 --> 13:14.476
There's no beauty in perfection, honey.

13:14.477 --> 13:17.243
Hmm.

13:17.244 --> 13:20.210
What's with the birdcage?

13:20.211 --> 13:23.043
Picked it up at a yard sale.

13:23.044 --> 13:25.110
Reminded me of Cheep.

13:25.111 --> 13:29.776
It's funny, you know, but
I miss that little bird.

13:29.777 --> 13:32.876
Me too.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.376
Used to fly all around the house.

13:35.377 --> 13:36.976
Remember?

13:36.977 --> 13:39.344
Like a Disney movie.

13:41.544 --> 13:44.343
- Hap?
- Mm-hmm.

13:44.344 --> 13:45.810
I need your help.

13:49.577 --> 13:51.410
I'm broke, Trudy.

13:51.411 --> 13:54.143
All I got are bills and late notices...

13:54.144 --> 13:58.010
I didn't come for money.

13:58.011 --> 14:01.143
You always come for something.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.743
You're the only one I could ask.

14:03.744 --> 14:05.110
It's big.

14:05.111 --> 14:09.310
And it could be good for both of us.

14:09.311 --> 14:11.443
Okay.

14:11.444 --> 14:13.177
Ask.

14:16.177 --> 14:18.143
Hap, my love,

14:18.144 --> 14:21.144
how would you like to make $200,000?

14:34.049 --> 14:35.682
You're soft, boy.

14:35.683 --> 14:37.382
You fight like a man
that's been getting laid.

14:39.349 --> 14:43.148
And you hit like a man who isn't.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.948
You're cute when you gloat.

14:45.949 --> 14:47.148
You know that?

14:47.149 --> 14:49.215
Yeah. I'm cute when I fart.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.848
And I'm cute when I take a shit.

14:53.149 --> 14:55.182
No, when you take a shit,

14:55.183 --> 14:57.215
you look like you're meltin'.

14:57.216 --> 15:00.082
Stop!

15:00.083 --> 15:02.748
So what you doing here, anyway?

15:02.749 --> 15:04.848
You ain't never woke up this
early on a Sunday morning

15:04.849 --> 15:06.482
in your life.

15:06.483 --> 15:08.048
I got a deal.

15:08.049 --> 15:10.582
I was thinking about
cutting you in on it.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.915
A lot of money.

15:12.916 --> 15:13.982
How much?

15:13.983 --> 15:15.515
Lots.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.982
You could start your own business.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.682
Maybe get a little shoeshine stand

15:20.683 --> 15:22.782
down at the bus depot.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.282
Whoa.

15:26.283 --> 15:28.948
You all right, peckerwood?

15:28.949 --> 15:33.382
I've been worse.

15:33.383 --> 15:35.449
Barn's spinning, though.

15:38.549 --> 15:40.782
You always overcommit

15:40.783 --> 15:42.415
in love and war.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.382
That's your problem, my friend.

15:44.383 --> 15:47.782
Ever since we was kids.

15:47.783 --> 15:49.515
How much money we talking?

15:49.516 --> 15:52.115
$100,000...

15:52.116 --> 15:53.682
Each.

15:53.683 --> 15:54.815
We got to shoot somebody?

15:54.816 --> 15:56.215
Uh-uh.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.649
All we got to do is swim for it.

16:01.416 --> 16:03.948
I don't like being
railroaded like this, Hap.

16:03.949 --> 16:06.082
You should have asked
me before you told him.

16:06.083 --> 16:09.648
Well, if you don't want
him, you can't have me.

16:09.649 --> 16:12.082
It's a package deal or no deal.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.282
Howard wasn't that keen

16:13.283 --> 16:15.415
on me asking you in the first place.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.048
Just use that trailer
trash charm of yours.

16:18.049 --> 16:19.948
Works on Hap.

16:19.949 --> 16:22.048
Know what your problem is, Leonard?

16:22.049 --> 16:23.148
You're jealous.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.715
Always have been.

16:24.716 --> 16:26.382
Oh, baby, Hap's got a perky ass and all,

16:26.383 --> 16:27.615
but he ain't my type.

16:27.616 --> 16:29.815
Oh, just can it, both of you.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.482
Can't we just pretend to be friends?

16:31.483 --> 16:33.082
For now, at least?

16:33.083 --> 16:36.848
Okay, tell Leonard what you told me.

16:36.849 --> 16:41.415
I want him to hear it from you
before he makes up his mind.

16:41.416 --> 16:43.848
Okay.

16:43.849 --> 16:45.482
My last husband, Howard,

16:45.483 --> 16:48.248
traveled the country speaking
against nuclear reactors

16:48.249 --> 16:49.748
until he got arrested.

16:49.749 --> 16:52.015
"Damaging government
property," they called it.

16:52.016 --> 16:53.248
Howard thought it was his responsibility

16:53.249 --> 16:54.315
as a human being...

16:54.316 --> 16:55.582
Spare me the politics.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.482
It is bad for my heart.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.148
Just the goods, pretty please.

16:59.149 --> 17:00.782
Fine.

17:00.783 --> 17:02.882
Howard got sentenced to two
years at Leavenworth...

17:02.883 --> 17:04.882
My alma mater.

17:04.883 --> 17:06.281
All her ex-husbands go there.

17:06.282 --> 17:08.382
And while he was in prison,

17:08.383 --> 17:11.515
he met a man named Softboy McCall.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.714
They called him the Raccoon Bandit.

17:15.715 --> 17:18.015
Now, Softboy fancied himself a gangster.

17:18.016 --> 17:20.015
Help! Oh, shit!

17:20.016 --> 17:22.214
But he wasn't the brightest
crayon in the box.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.548
Hey, hey.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.182
Howard...

17:25.183 --> 17:27.214
Howard ends up being his cellmate.

17:27.215 --> 17:29.215
They get close.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.048
They get so close,

17:31.049 --> 17:32.948
he tells him about a car
full of stolen money

17:32.949 --> 17:35.382
he left laying at the
bottom of the Sabine River.

17:35.383 --> 17:38.982
A million dollars.

17:38.983 --> 17:43.048
Tells Howard if he can find
it, he'll split it with him.

17:43.049 --> 17:45.982
Let me guess the end of this here story.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.848
He told Howard where the money is.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.982
And no one else knows about it.

17:49.983 --> 17:51.348
What about this Softboy?

17:51.349 --> 17:52.815
He never made it out.

17:52.816 --> 17:55.215
Prison food didn't suit him.

18:01.049 --> 18:02.715
Hmm?

18:17.883 --> 18:19.682
The police didn't search
the river for this money?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.682
They did, but Softboy

18:21.683 --> 18:25.015
left out one detail he only told Howard.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.615
The Iron Bridge.

18:26.616 --> 18:28.182
What bridge?

18:28.183 --> 18:29.782
When Hap and I were married,

18:29.783 --> 18:31.915
he'd talk about this old
bridge in Marvel Creek.

18:31.916 --> 18:33.748
My dad used to take me there fishin',

18:33.749 --> 18:37.215
you know, when he could get around.

18:37.216 --> 18:40.448
A lot of stories about that bridge.

18:40.449 --> 18:44.948
Lot of bad things happened
there over the years.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.982
Local kids say it's haunted.

18:47.983 --> 18:50.715
So, uh, how come you
and Howard ain't try

18:50.716 --> 18:52.448
to find the money on your own?

18:52.449 --> 18:54.148
Howard doesn't know the Sabine River,

18:54.149 --> 18:55.915
and he can't find the bridge.

18:55.916 --> 18:57.382
But Hap can.

18:57.383 --> 18:59.048
Hell, Hap can't even
find a pair of shoes

18:59.049 --> 19:00.915
he had on last night, much less a bridge

19:00.916 --> 19:02.882
he ain't seen in over 20 years.

19:02.883 --> 19:05.315
'Cept my shoes don't have
a million dollars in 'em.

19:06.383 --> 19:09.482
I need something like this.

19:09.483 --> 19:12.882
So do you.

19:12.883 --> 19:14.482
Now, what do you say, partner?

19:16.616 --> 19:18.848
What are the cops doing here?

19:25.849 --> 19:27.683
Uncle Chester.

19:30.449 --> 19:34.282
Pine, this belongs to you.

19:34.283 --> 19:36.015
What'd he do now?

19:36.016 --> 19:37.615
Caused a nuisance over at the pharmacy

19:37.616 --> 19:40.248
over some out-of-date coupons.

19:40.249 --> 19:42.448
- Coupons?
- Knocked over a display.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.848
I was gonna run him in,

19:43.849 --> 19:45.282
but Mr. Clemens wouldn't press charges.

19:45.283 --> 19:46.748
Told me to bring him out here.

19:46.749 --> 19:49.848
He threatened to shove
this cane up my ass.

19:49.849 --> 19:51.682
- That all?
- Sideways.

19:51.683 --> 19:55.115
Something funny?

19:55.116 --> 19:56.549
No, no.

19:58.183 --> 20:00.015
Who's she?

20:00.016 --> 20:01.715
You don't recognize her?

20:01.716 --> 20:05.015
That's Miss Laborde, 1967.

20:05.016 --> 20:07.148
Don't smart-mouth me.

20:07.149 --> 20:09.849
I-I wasn't. She actually is.

20:11.716 --> 20:13.115
We'll take him home.

20:13.116 --> 20:15.483
Thanks.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.282
I need an answer, Hap.

20:19.283 --> 20:21.049
Okay. Later.

20:33.916 --> 20:35.516
Get, get!

20:40.016 --> 20:42.382
Come on, shitheads. Take me home.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.515
I tell you, much as you've
been seeing the cops,

20:52.516 --> 20:55.682
you might as well go and get
'em a chauffeur's outfit.

20:55.683 --> 20:57.115
Start tipping 'em.

20:57.116 --> 21:00.348
Save your smart mouth
for your boyfriend.

21:00.349 --> 21:02.649
I used to wipe your black ass, boy.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.582
That's a nice cane you
got there, Mr. Pine.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.015
You trying to be funny?

21:12.016 --> 21:14.215
- Nope. No, sir.
- Don't patronize me.

21:14.216 --> 21:16.282
All right, Chester, just lay off.

21:16.283 --> 21:18.182
Rag on me all you want,
but leave Hap out of it.

21:18.183 --> 21:19.882
He do me a favor.

21:22.516 --> 21:23.615
Get...

21:23.616 --> 21:25.615
Get your faggot hands off me.

21:47.416 --> 21:48.948
Come on, lemme out. Lemme out,

21:48.949 --> 21:50.382
so you and your bitch can go home

21:50.383 --> 21:51.882
and cheek stuff each other.

21:51.883 --> 21:53.016
Come on.

21:59.549 --> 22:01.782
Listen to me, Mr. Pine.

22:01.783 --> 22:04.915
Your nephew is my friend.

22:04.916 --> 22:08.982
Now, I don't like dick any
more than you do, but he does,

22:08.983 --> 22:11.315
but that's his business.

22:11.316 --> 22:14.615
He don't need you riding him on it.

22:14.616 --> 22:16.615
So you do that in front of me again,

22:16.616 --> 22:19.015
I'm gonna take that cane,
shove it up your ass,

22:19.016 --> 22:20.815
and break it clean off.

22:20.816 --> 22:22.448
Understood?

22:22.449 --> 22:24.348
So what's it with the two of you anyway?

22:24.349 --> 22:27.515
Him the way he is and
you the way you are.

22:27.516 --> 22:28.648
I don't get it.

22:28.649 --> 22:31.682
You don't have to.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.815
Now, you can get out of the truck,

22:35.816 --> 22:37.216
sir.

22:43.816 --> 22:46.015
Sons of bitches!

22:46.016 --> 22:48.148
Lowlife niggers!

22:48.149 --> 22:49.815
What is it, Mr. Pine?

22:49.816 --> 22:53.482
Oh, all them crack-smoking shitheads,

22:53.483 --> 22:55.448
they broke my lock again.

22:55.449 --> 22:59.115
I ain't got shit, and they
keep breaking in anyway.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.715
Stealing my toilet paper, tuna fish.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.349
Think that's funny.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.216
Leonard...

23:12.983 --> 23:14.215
You bad now, huh?

23:14.216 --> 23:15.515
What you gonna do...

23:16.649 --> 23:19.682
Oh!

23:26.216 --> 23:28.048
Any one of y'all mess
with that old man again,

23:28.049 --> 23:29.582
I'll come back and rip you so hard,

23:29.583 --> 23:31.248
your daddy ass'll bleed.

23:31.249 --> 23:32.548
You hear me?

23:32.549 --> 23:33.982
We done?

23:33.983 --> 23:35.849
Yeah, we done.

23:45.849 --> 23:46.849
'Bout that money...

23:46.850 --> 23:48.548
Mm-hmm?

23:48.549 --> 23:50.015
When we leavin'?

23:50.016 --> 23:51.549
Soon as.

23:59.128 --> 24:01.227
Hey, what about your .22 target pistol

24:01.228 --> 24:03.227
and your Hopalong Cassidy cap gun?

24:03.228 --> 24:05.060
Ha, ha.

24:05.061 --> 24:06.893
Maybe you could find a bazooka

24:06.894 --> 24:07.993
or a couple of land mines,

24:07.994 --> 24:09.693
some grenades.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.806
Shit, we're just gonna dive
down to find that money,

24:12.831 --> 24:14.264
not shoot at it.

24:14.265 --> 24:15.597
You know, for a hell of a shot,

24:15.598 --> 24:16.693
you sure do hate guns.

24:16.787 --> 24:18.186
I don't mind guns.

24:18.187 --> 24:19.686
I mind what they used for.

24:19.687 --> 24:22.386
Look, Trudy's your cross to bear.

24:22.387 --> 24:24.119
We don't know this Howard from nothing.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.953
Oh, he's a hippie idealist.

24:26.954 --> 24:30.019
He's gonna take that money from
the big bad capitalist bank

24:30.020 --> 24:33.786
and give it to a good cause.

24:33.787 --> 24:35.319
What cause?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.886
Save the seals. Save the whales.

24:36.887 --> 24:39.319
I didn't ask.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.886
I get any money out of this,

24:40.887 --> 24:43.219
the only cause I'ma give it to is me.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.986
Seals ain't got no bills to pay.

24:44.987 --> 24:47.253
Yeah.

24:47.254 --> 24:50.186
How close is this Howard
and Trudy, anyway?

24:50.187 --> 24:54.686
I don't know, and I don't care.

24:54.687 --> 24:58.353
I told you... just getting
laid, that's all.

24:59.754 --> 25:02.986
Boy, you keep telling yourself that.

25:02.987 --> 25:05.419
I don't know how I let you
talk me into these things.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.886
Well, rumor has it,

25:06.887 --> 25:08.819
it's something to do with my perky ass.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.353
Christ, perky ass?

25:10.354 --> 25:13.919
Oh, I only said that to annoy Trudy.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.587
You being alive annoys Trudy.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.086
Hey, good boy...

25:25.087 --> 25:27.186
Good boy.

25:27.187 --> 25:30.819
Yeah.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.553
They gonna be okay while you're gone?

25:32.554 --> 25:35.719
Neighbor gonna look after 'em for me.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.919
Hey, babies.

25:45.287 --> 25:47.286
What's his problem?

25:47.287 --> 25:50.919
He's protective of Leonard,
especially around new people.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.553
Turns on a dime. That's
why I named him Switch.

25:53.554 --> 25:56.253
You think this is funny, don't you?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.287
Your dog is dangerous, Leonard.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.020
Just a good judge of character.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.853
What the hell is this place?

27:46.854 --> 27:50.486
Used to belong to a biker
gang; the feds busted 'em,

27:50.487 --> 27:53.086
and the bank foreclosed on the property.

27:57.687 --> 27:59.254
Hey, Chub.

28:02.487 --> 28:04.354
Oh, hey, Trudy.

28:15.687 --> 28:18.519
This is Hap and Leonard.
They're with us.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:21.287 --> 28:23.186
I ain't giving my share to no whales.

28:23.187 --> 28:25.419
I read "Moby Dick." I
was rooting for Ahab.

28:25.420 --> 28:28.419
This is Chub.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.353
My real name's Charles.

28:30.354 --> 28:34.053
Everybody calls me Chub,
you know, 'cause I'm fat.

28:34.054 --> 28:36.553
I didn't know Trudy had any
African-American friends.

28:36.554 --> 28:38.519
She don't.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.486
I'm an admirer of Martin Luther King.

28:40.487 --> 28:41.753
Never met him.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.619
Gandhi, either.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.219
I seen Elvis, though, once,

28:45.220 --> 28:47.153
at a Bob's Big Boy when I was a kid.

28:47.154 --> 28:49.053
Oh, I love Elvis.

28:49.054 --> 28:52.386
Did you know that Elvis
had an Oedipus complex?

28:52.387 --> 28:54.586
Chub's father had anger issues.

28:54.625 --> 28:57.081
He used to beat on my mama and me.

28:57.137 --> 28:59.569
Chub's been through analysis.
He's come real far.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.802
Want to follow me?

29:49.403 --> 29:51.603
Oh, my, he's a catch.

29:59.503 --> 30:00.902
Howard, this is Hap.

30:00.903 --> 30:02.369
Hey.

30:02.370 --> 30:03.869
So nice to meet you.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.570
So nice to meet you.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.036
Trudy's told me a lot about you.

30:10.037 --> 30:11.969
Oh.

30:11.970 --> 30:14.936
And this is Leonard.

30:14.937 --> 30:16.869
He's in on it too.

30:16.870 --> 30:18.769
Wouldn't come without him.

30:18.770 --> 30:20.336
It's like they're married or something.

30:20.337 --> 30:22.136
Just engaged.

30:22.137 --> 30:23.869
Still picking out china.

30:23.870 --> 30:25.402
It's okay.

30:25.403 --> 30:28.569
Leonard was a marine.
He's a trained diver.

30:28.570 --> 30:29.702
Yeah, right.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.169
So you swim, right?

30:31.170 --> 30:33.936
Like a goddamn eel.

30:33.937 --> 30:35.937
Okay, well, welcome.

30:37.737 --> 30:40.469
So let's head inside.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.102
Get the team acquainted.

30:42.103 --> 30:43.670
Come on.

30:50.403 --> 30:53.369
"Team." I like that.

30:53.370 --> 30:56.502
Maybe we'll get some
T-shirts with a logo on it.

30:56.503 --> 31:00.802
Thinking "Bozos," or
"Dipshit Ex-Husbands."

31:11.503 --> 31:13.170
I'm Paco.

31:35.714 --> 31:39.879
The spirit of the era
is still alive here,

31:39.880 --> 31:43.213
and those ideals we held are
not dead, just sleeping.

31:43.214 --> 31:46.179
Like a hibernating bear,
it's time we wake it up.

31:46.180 --> 31:47.846
Yeah, that... that... it's great.

31:47.847 --> 31:52.013
That's all good, but
it's been a long drive,

31:52.014 --> 31:56.313
and we thought we were here
to talk business, so...

31:56.314 --> 31:57.979
This...

31:57.980 --> 32:00.113
this is our business.

32:00.114 --> 32:01.679
To unite people.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.079
We've become a nation
that values nothing,

32:04.080 --> 32:06.913
except greed, consumption,

32:06.914 --> 32:09.679
turning our backs on
those who need us most.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.346
All the while lining the
pockets of Wall Street.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.213
- Right.
- Big business.

32:14.214 --> 32:16.246
The '90s are right around the corner.

32:16.247 --> 32:18.213
We're still ignoring social injustices

32:18.214 --> 32:20.046
like economic disparity,

32:20.047 --> 32:21.913
and where's your piece of
the American pie, Leonard?

32:21.914 --> 32:23.713
Oh, I ate mine.

32:23.714 --> 32:24.779
Howard's right.

32:24.780 --> 32:26.746
People are getting smothered.

32:26.747 --> 32:28.179
Rich get richer while
the poor get poorer...

32:28.180 --> 32:29.513
- Get obliterated.
- Mm-hmm!

32:29.514 --> 32:31.880
I mean, just look at you two.

32:35.114 --> 32:38.346
Well, on that note,

32:38.347 --> 32:41.779
think I'ma go have me a pipe.

32:41.780 --> 32:44.279
Call me when you get around
to the folk song part.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.314
I'm good on "I Got a Hammer."

32:53.147 --> 32:55.013
I don't think your friend likes us.

32:55.014 --> 32:58.146
Well, my friend didn't spend
the '60s smoking dope

32:58.147 --> 32:59.813
and protesting.

32:59.814 --> 33:01.979
No, he... he spent 'em

33:01.980 --> 33:05.546
trying not to get his ass
shot off in Vietnam.

33:05.547 --> 33:07.813
So he knows about guns.

33:07.814 --> 33:10.046
Like a dog knows his own ass.

33:13.014 --> 33:16.579
Hey, uh, why do I get that feeling

33:16.580 --> 33:20.213
that I-I'm being recruited?

33:20.214 --> 33:22.679
Like-minded people need to work together

33:22.680 --> 33:24.979
if there's any hope for
change in this world.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.846
Yeah, I think the world

33:26.847 --> 33:33.613
will be as it is with
or without Hap Collins.

33:33.614 --> 33:36.079
I learned that the hard way.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.046
You can't be that jaded, Hap.

33:38.047 --> 33:40.579
You used to dream about
these kind of ideas.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.479
We can still make a difference.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.946
With speeches?

33:43.947 --> 33:46.946
With money, man.

33:46.947 --> 33:50.113
There's a million dollars at
the bottom of that river,

33:50.114 --> 33:52.146
and it can be a seed.

33:52.147 --> 33:55.579
If we plant it, it'll grow,

33:55.580 --> 33:58.013
and it can be used to
even the playing field

33:58.014 --> 34:00.546
between the haves and the have-nots.

34:00.547 --> 34:05.713
Yeah, this, uh, have-not

34:05.714 --> 34:07.813
is gonna keep his money.

34:07.814 --> 34:09.545
End of story.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.946
You know, change is scary.

34:11.947 --> 34:13.713
Some people, they can't do it,

34:13.714 --> 34:16.379
and they just run and hide
in their little cocoon.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.346
It's a defense mechanism.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.513
Ow! Paco!

34:20.514 --> 34:22.379
You cut out that self-help shit,

34:22.380 --> 34:25.978
or I'll knock you down for real.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.879
He ain't interested.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.914
Let him find the bridge,
and leave it at that.

34:42.047 --> 34:45.579
Well, I got to say, I
am disappointed, Hap.

34:45.580 --> 34:49.347
Now, Trudy led me to believe
you'd be different.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.713
Yeah, well...

34:52.714 --> 34:58.413
Trudy doesn't know me as
well as she used to, so...

34:58.414 --> 35:00.179
Look, it's been a long day,

35:00.180 --> 35:04.479
and I think us kids should,
uh, call it a night.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.446
What kids?

35:06.447 --> 35:07.879
We're all adults here.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.246
Really?

35:09.247 --> 35:10.746
Have you listened to yourself recently?

35:10.747 --> 35:12.979
'Cause you sound like a college freshman

35:12.980 --> 35:15.213
who's said good-bye to his
mom and dad and found dope

35:15.214 --> 35:18.246
and liberal politics for the first time.

35:18.247 --> 35:21.913
Well, I can't help but think
there's more to this, Hap.

35:21.914 --> 35:25.613
Now, maybe it has something to
do with your feelings for Trudy.

35:25.614 --> 35:30.013
Making you lose sight
of the bigger picture.

35:30.014 --> 35:34.246
Hey, uh, how's this
for a bigger picture?

35:34.247 --> 35:37.146
- Whoa, hey. Whoa, hey.
- Howard, don't.

35:37.147 --> 35:38.979
You can't argue with him
when he's like this.

35:38.980 --> 35:42.179
She's right; I'd be willing
to place a small wager

35:42.180 --> 35:45.146
on the fact that she's not
telling you everything.

35:45.147 --> 35:46.579
But, I mean, she told me

35:46.580 --> 35:49.446
that you two made love last night,

35:49.447 --> 35:52.246
if that's what you mean.

35:52.247 --> 35:55.246
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.

35:55.247 --> 35:58.113
We don't play possessive
games here, man.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.913
I mean, it's just sex, right?

36:01.914 --> 36:04.646
It doesn't mean anything.

36:04.647 --> 36:07.346
- Maybe it don't to you.
- No, hey, look.

36:07.347 --> 36:09.913
Trudy doesn't belong to me,

36:09.914 --> 36:13.646
and she doesn't belong
to you, all right?

36:13.647 --> 36:16.946
She's her own woman, and
we're all friends here.

36:16.947 --> 36:18.613
Yeah.

36:18.614 --> 36:21.313
Ah!

36:21.314 --> 36:25.546
We didn't come here to
make friends, friend.

36:25.547 --> 36:27.346
Hap, let him go.

36:27.347 --> 36:28.713
It's over.

36:28.714 --> 36:31.846
Howard, is it over?

36:31.847 --> 36:33.446
Yeah.

36:33.447 --> 36:34.813
Yeah, man, it's over.

36:34.814 --> 36:36.679
Good.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.047
Good.

36:47.847 --> 36:49.714
Good night.

36:52.847 --> 36:55.779
So, uh...

36:55.780 --> 36:58.513
so that's your Howard, huh?

36:58.514 --> 36:59.813
What happened to you?

36:59.814 --> 37:01.314
Life.

37:04.214 --> 37:07.313
And you.

37:07.314 --> 37:09.247
That didn't help.

37:25.236 --> 37:27.268
I'll tell you, boy,

37:27.298 --> 37:29.497
I let you talk me into some dumb shit,

37:29.498 --> 37:33.131
but this right here take
the dumb shit cake.

37:33.132 --> 37:34.597
Hmm.

37:34.598 --> 37:39.031
These people a bunch a
cotton-pickin' clowns.

37:39.032 --> 37:41.497
Maybe you're right,

37:41.498 --> 37:44.531
but at least they're trying.

37:44.532 --> 37:48.664
Well, if the '60s had never happened,

37:48.665 --> 37:51.131
you might still be drinking
out of a water fountain

37:51.132 --> 37:53.564
marked "colored."

37:53.565 --> 37:55.498
You sound like the fat one.

38:01.265 --> 38:03.231
Where you going?

38:03.232 --> 38:04.997
Take a ride.

38:04.998 --> 38:07.564
I need some air.

40:30.332 --> 40:32.831
That nigger's wetter than
a well digger's ass.

40:41.732 --> 40:43.864
Damn it.

40:55.965 --> 40:59.231
All right, nigger's
got a kid in the car.

40:59.232 --> 41:01.064
You stay here, Hap.

41:01.065 --> 41:02.865
Hold down the wagon train.

41:05.198 --> 41:07.931
Stay put, you hear?

42:05.465 --> 42:07.664
Hey there, fella.

42:07.665 --> 42:09.264
Know you got a taillight out.

42:11.265 --> 42:14.197
Hey there, officer.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.697
Yeah, I saw you pass a
ways back, and I, uh...

42:17.698 --> 42:20.964
Hmm, okay.

42:20.965 --> 42:24.331
Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to write you up for it.

42:24.332 --> 42:28.597
You got to do what you got to do.

42:28.598 --> 42:31.964
Are you high, son?

42:31.965 --> 42:33.331
High on life.

42:35.598 --> 42:36.697
What's that?

42:36.698 --> 42:39.031
What's what?

42:39.032 --> 42:41.264
I'm gonna need you to
step out of the car, son.

42:41.265 --> 42:43.064
Come on.

42:43.065 --> 42:45.164
Now, keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

42:45.165 --> 42:46.597
Yes, sir.

42:46.598 --> 42:49.397
- I need you to open this trunk.
- Uh-huh.

42:49.398 --> 42:50.964
- This one?
- Yeah, this is the one.

42:50.965 --> 42:51.965
All right.

42:51.966 --> 42:53.197
Come on.

42:53.198 --> 42:56.731
Do it. Do it slowly.

42:56.732 --> 42:58.664
The hell are you smilin' about?

42:58.665 --> 42:59.731
Disco.

42:59.732 --> 43:00.997
What-co?

43:00.998 --> 43:03.431
Disco ball.

43:03.432 --> 43:05.231
Whump-whump. Whump-whump.

43:05.232 --> 43:06.531
What the shit?

43:06.532 --> 43:09.097
Oh!

43:24.332 --> 43:25.531
That's my girl.

43:29.998 --> 43:31.497
Now...

43:31.498 --> 43:34.831
I'm looking for a man named Paco.
