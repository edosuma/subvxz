02:12.137 --> 02:14.672
You're not answering your phone.

02:14.706 --> 02:15.673
It's off.

02:15.707 --> 02:17.074
Were you sleeping?

02:17.109 --> 02:18.709
No.

02:18.744 --> 02:19.952
Dyson sent me.

02:21.437 --> 02:22.437
They found a body.

02:24.449 --> 02:26.140
Where's McLeod?

02:26.190 --> 02:27.914
<i>No, she doesn't want McLeod.</i>

02:28.954 --> 02:29.954
She wants you.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.079
Look at this, Delorme.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.425
A young couple gets a new TV set.

02:34.459 --> 02:36.527
<i>You'd think it'd be a happy day.</i>

02:36.561 --> 02:39.397
<i>These two hate each other right now.</i>

02:39.431 --> 02:40.431
Cardinal.

02:42.698 --> 02:44.201
It's not my department anymore.

02:51.708 --> 02:52.933
It's a child.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.277
<i>They think it might be her.</i>

03:24.669 --> 03:26.510
<i>I thought you were in exile.</i>

03:26.545 --> 03:27.545
<i>So did I.</i>

03:28.544 --> 03:29.847
<i>You got the call on this?</i>

03:29.881 --> 03:31.983
<i>Yeah. First on the
scene was one of ours.</i>

03:32.017 --> 03:34.185
<i>Gentlemen, who's been inside?</i>

03:34.219 --> 03:35.419
<i>Collier and our civilian.</i>

03:35.454 --> 03:36.854
<i>The guy was here stripping wire.</i>

03:37.456 --> 03:38.956
I took a look inside too, sir.

03:38.991 --> 03:40.858
I thought I'd get a little jump on things.

03:40.892 --> 03:41.892
Okay.

03:43.028 --> 03:43.995
All right.

03:44.029 --> 03:45.763
<i>Gentlemen, suit up. In you go.</i>

03:45.797 --> 03:47.264
<i>Let me know what you need.</i>

03:47.299 --> 03:48.499
<i>Fox, come here.</i>

03:48.572 --> 03:49.400
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:49.468 --> 03:51.469
There's a lot of snow to cull here.

03:51.503 --> 03:53.709
We're gonna need tents,
generators, the whole circus.

03:53.744 --> 03:55.234
I mean, I can put in the call if you like.

03:55.288 --> 03:57.375
Constable, I'm gonna need your boots.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.180
- My boots?
- And then I want you to go home.

03:59.254 --> 04:00.462
You're dismissed.

04:01.980 --> 04:02.947
Sir.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.548
<i>You have kids? Pets?</i>

04:04.583 --> 04:06.183
Carpet in your TV room?

04:06.218 --> 04:08.152
I have... two kids.

04:08.186 --> 04:10.618
Their DNA is now
contaminating the crime scene,

04:10.665 --> 04:12.842
the unprocessed crime scene

04:12.896 --> 04:15.746
- that you chose to enter.
- Sir, I swear, I...

04:15.781 --> 04:17.161
Let me tell you something.

04:17.195 --> 04:19.091
If one day we're lucky
enough to get this guy,

04:19.178 --> 04:21.531
I can't have you serving up freebies

04:21.565 --> 04:23.334
<i>to his defence attorney.</i>

04:23.368 --> 04:24.368
So...

04:26.488 --> 04:27.488
off they come.

04:38.592 --> 04:40.639
<i>Facial features
partially obliterated,</i>

04:40.717 --> 04:43.254
<i>and likely by animal interference.</i>

04:43.288 --> 04:45.056
<i>Left eye missing.</i>

04:45.090 --> 04:47.498
<i>Right eye damaged but intact.</i>

04:48.427 --> 04:50.061
<i>Body is clothed.</i>

04:50.095 --> 04:53.364
<i>Denim jeans cover the lower portion.</i>

04:53.398 --> 04:55.566
<i>Torn away at the left leg.</i>

04:55.600 --> 04:56.687
<i>There's a spot up top</i>

04:56.775 --> 04:58.779
<i>where it looks like water collects.</i>

05:00.305 --> 05:01.867
<i>I bet she's resting on a drain.</i>

05:01.903 --> 05:04.255
<i>Partially detached from her skull.</i>

05:05.244 --> 05:06.503
Filled up around her.

05:07.379 --> 05:08.379
Froze solid.

05:14.182 --> 05:15.181
<i>It's her.</i>

05:16.254 --> 05:17.254
You're sure?

05:17.722 --> 05:18.852
Blue hoodie.

05:18.930 --> 05:20.931
She was wearing it when she disappeared.

05:20.993 --> 05:23.101
<i>Okay. Well, let's do this then.</i>

05:23.157 --> 05:24.613
Let's have our moment.

05:25.130 --> 05:26.762
<i>I'm serious, John.</i>

05:26.797 --> 05:27.899
<i>If you want to say I told you so,</i>

05:27.977 --> 05:29.100
now's your chance.

05:29.134 --> 05:30.605
I don't have anything to say.

05:30.755 --> 05:32.169
She could have run away.

05:32.247 --> 05:34.138
She could have been with
some cousin in Temiskaming.

05:34.172 --> 05:35.239
We didn't know.

05:35.273 --> 05:36.307
That's why you keep looking.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.379
<i>We tried.</i>

05:37.742 --> 05:38.943
We failed.

05:38.977 --> 05:40.077
We moved on.

05:40.112 --> 05:41.745
You should put on that on the crest.

05:44.282 --> 05:46.083
If I make you the lead on this,

05:46.118 --> 05:48.612
<i>I need to know that
you're not gonna drift.</i>

05:53.454 --> 05:54.454
Yeah.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.394
So McLeod can't be your second.

05:57.456 --> 05:58.929
He's in court all month.

05:58.964 --> 05:59.964
<i>Who then?</i>

06:02.839 --> 06:04.847
You're kidding. She just transferred.

06:04.882 --> 06:05.436
Lucky her.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.077
She gets to learn from the best.

06:10.228 --> 06:12.217
I'm glad to be working on this with you.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.481
<i>How long were you
in Financial Crimes?</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:30.661
<i>Five years.</i>

07:31.456 --> 07:33.655
Any homicide rotations?

07:33.690 --> 07:34.528
Scene work?

07:34.563 --> 07:35.563
Anything?

07:36.716 --> 07:37.716
No.

07:38.096 --> 07:40.064
But look, I know this case.

07:40.098 --> 07:41.065
I know the history.

07:41.099 --> 07:43.343
<i>Everyone thought
Katie Pine ran away,</i>

07:43.468 --> 07:44.435
except you.

07:44.469 --> 07:46.168
Lot of good that did her.

07:46.271 --> 07:48.026
How'd you know she'd been abducted?

07:48.096 --> 07:49.152
What was your thinking?

07:49.206 --> 07:50.174
You want to be careful.

07:50.255 --> 07:52.465
Those questions got me kicked off homicide.

07:55.313 --> 07:56.880
I thought yelling at your Sergeant

07:56.938 --> 07:58.457
got you kicked off homicide.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.859
<i>Is that what you heard?</i>

08:01.753 --> 08:04.286
What I heard is that you
ran through a year's manpower

08:04.388 --> 08:05.556
<i>on this one case,</i>

08:05.590 --> 08:08.025
<i>ran everyone ragged</i>

08:08.059 --> 08:11.444
and then fell asleep
driving home one night,

08:11.479 --> 08:13.264
<i>crashed into a dumpster.</i>

08:13.298 --> 08:14.298
Wrong.

08:16.134 --> 08:17.534
It was a hydro box.

08:17.569 --> 08:19.603
Much more expensive.

08:19.638 --> 08:21.238
Here's what I need you to do.

08:21.273 --> 08:22.273
As my new partner,

08:22.307 --> 08:24.275
I need you to cover off my active cases,

08:24.309 --> 08:25.734
unsolved B&Es,

08:25.804 --> 08:26.410
dozens of them,

08:26.444 --> 08:27.782
stretching back a year.

08:28.936 --> 08:29.936
Get up to speed.

08:31.190 --> 08:32.370
Okay.

08:35.030 --> 08:37.576
See, the thing with John is two-fold.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.890
First, whatever you do, stand up to him

08:39.924 --> 08:41.825
and don't be a yes man.

08:41.860 --> 08:42.860
I'm not.

08:43.821 --> 08:45.062
And second?

08:45.634 --> 08:46.929
Never disagree with him.

08:48.056 --> 08:49.056
Huh.

08:50.101 --> 08:51.101
Sure.

09:10.788 --> 09:12.115
<i>Katie's remains</i>

09:12.201 --> 09:13.942
<i>have been transported
to the forensics lab</i>

09:14.016 --> 09:15.016
<i>in Toronto.</i>

09:15.660 --> 09:16.760
Okay.

09:16.795 --> 09:18.117
<i>It'll take a few days</i>

09:18.199 --> 09:20.242
<i>and then we'll release her to you.</i>

09:22.104 --> 09:23.918
<i>There will be more questions</i>

09:24.004 --> 09:25.029
and we'll have to go over some ground

09:25.092 --> 09:27.471
we've already covered.

09:27.505 --> 09:29.173
I'm sorry to put you through that again.

09:33.044 --> 09:35.356
We're gonna throw everything
we have at this, Dorothy.

09:38.526 --> 09:40.009
You said that before.

09:41.105 --> 09:42.272
Then you stopped looking.

10:06.377 --> 10:08.433
<i>There'll be a fire later for Katie.</i>

10:08.503 --> 10:10.214
<i>You're welcome to come if you want.</i>

10:10.248 --> 10:12.790
I don't know, Jerry. It
wouldn't-wouldn't feel right.

10:13.789 --> 10:14.789
<i>Hey, John.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:19.289
People are gonna think what they think.

10:20.024 --> 10:22.566
But I know you did everything
you could for Katie.

10:47.752 --> 10:48.986
<i>Delorme here.</i>

10:49.020 --> 10:51.348
<i>Katie Pine wasn't this
guy's first victim.</i>

10:52.056 --> 10:53.324
<i>You wanted to know my thinking.</i>

10:53.363 --> 10:54.625
<i>There it is.</i>

10:54.659 --> 10:55.626
<i>He's a predator.</i>

10:55.698 --> 10:56.837
<i>She didn't know him.</i>

10:57.955 --> 11:00.264
<i>A little girl gets murdered,</i>

11:00.298 --> 11:02.800
you look close.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.601
A neighbour. An uncle.

11:04.636 --> 11:07.104
I looked, Delorme.

11:07.138 --> 11:08.261
Babysitters,

11:08.331 --> 11:09.473
band mates, cousins.

11:09.507 --> 11:10.574
I talked to them all.

11:10.608 --> 11:12.876
I know her life inside and out.

11:12.911 --> 11:15.212
Favourite song was "Shake It Off".

11:15.246 --> 11:17.003
<i>Favourite food, canned peaches.</i>

11:17.038 --> 11:17.948
<i>Best friend, Tina.</i>

11:17.982 --> 11:19.283
<i>Boyfriend, Arnold.</i>

11:19.317 --> 11:21.985
I know Katie Pine

11:22.020 --> 11:24.706
and this guy is not from her world.

11:25.590 --> 11:27.090
He stalked her.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.792
He picked his moment and he struck.

11:28.827 --> 11:30.235
And who does that?

11:31.663 --> 11:33.096
A repeater.

11:33.131 --> 11:35.814
But there's just one small problem.

11:35.885 --> 11:37.134
No more bodies.

11:37.168 --> 11:38.468
<i>Unless we missed it.</i>

11:39.103 --> 11:40.671
<i>When I first took this case,</i>

11:40.736 --> 11:42.390
<i>another file caught my eye.</i>

11:43.608 --> 11:44.944
<i>Billy LaBelle.</i>

11:45.038 --> 11:46.777
<i>Age ten.</i>

11:46.811 --> 11:47.778
<i>He drowned in the lake.</i>

11:47.812 --> 11:49.119
<i>You remember?</i>

11:49.195 --> 11:50.515
Yeah. An accident.

11:51.983 --> 11:53.183
There were witnesses.

11:53.218 --> 11:54.184
<i>No.</i>

11:54.219 --> 11:56.155
<i>LaBelle's mom went for smokes.</i>

11:57.155 --> 11:59.446
<i>When she came back, Billy was dead.</i>

11:59.791 --> 12:02.326
No one saw it happen.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.127
<i>No one saw what happen?</i>

12:04.162 --> 12:05.853
<i>A serial killer swoop in</i>

12:05.900 --> 12:07.460
<i>at that exact moment?</i>

12:07.523 --> 12:10.334
<i>LaBelle was found
face up in the water.</i>

12:10.368 --> 12:12.703
I talked to three different coroners.

12:12.737 --> 12:14.838
They all say that's unusual.

12:14.873 --> 12:17.174
The weight of your limbs

12:17.208 --> 12:19.877
keeps you face down.

12:19.911 --> 12:20.911
Unless,

12:21.874 --> 12:23.281
it wasn't an accident.

12:24.182 --> 12:25.616
<i>Young kid.</i>

12:25.650 --> 12:27.885
<i>All alone.</i>

12:27.919 --> 12:28.919
<i>Small.</i>

12:28.982 --> 12:30.621
Vulnerable.

12:31.053 --> 12:32.693
That's how these guys start.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.455
<i>He holds LaBelle under</i>

12:37.662 --> 12:40.163
<i>until his lungs fill.</i>

12:40.198 --> 12:41.910
Looks him in the eye while he does it.

12:43.566 --> 12:45.658
The biggest thrill of his life.

12:48.773 --> 12:50.173
What does Dyson think?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.456
Forget Dyson. I'm asking you.

12:55.058 --> 12:56.406
It's a stretch.

12:57.111 --> 12:58.915
LaBelle's mom was right there.

13:00.418 --> 13:01.734
The timing doesn't work.

13:04.977 --> 13:06.286
I'll see you in the morning.

13:07.512 --> 13:08.512
We're done?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.166
Good night.

13:12.994 --> 13:14.334
<i>And that's the new partner?</i>

13:16.568 --> 13:17.786
What did he want?

13:19.016 --> 13:20.815
He wanted to hear himself talk.

13:46.870 --> 13:48.099
<i>Westbrook building is clear.</i>

13:48.133 --> 13:49.500
<i>I'm gonna head to Chalmers Street.</i>

13:49.534 --> 13:50.367
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:50.402 --> 13:51.802
<i>Copy that.</i>

13:51.837 --> 13:53.204
Who are you?

13:53.238 --> 13:54.205
<i>Mrs. LaBelle,</i>

13:54.285 --> 13:55.874
<i>I am Detective John Cardinal.</i>

13:56.541 --> 13:58.109
<i>I told him not to go in.</i>

13:58.143 --> 14:01.645
<i>Told him to wait until I
got back but, you know,</i>

14:01.680 --> 14:03.180
<i>he's such a water rat.</i>

14:03.215 --> 14:05.149
<i>That's all he ever wanted to do.</i>

14:05.183 --> 14:06.984
So you're there, uh,

14:07.018 --> 14:08.348
for about an hour

14:08.587 --> 14:09.854
and then

14:09.888 --> 14:11.545
you go back up to the car for cigarettes.

14:11.608 --> 14:12.608
Is that right?

14:14.093 --> 14:16.994
And how far away was
the car, would you say?

14:17.294 --> 14:19.040
I don't know. Five minutes, if that.

14:20.473 --> 14:21.683
Is there something wrong?

14:22.312 --> 14:24.233
I told all this to the
other cop a bunch of times.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.036
Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.

14:26.071 --> 14:27.298
I'm just, uh,

14:28.007 --> 14:29.489
I'm just doing some follow up.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.865
<i>So, uh, gone ten minutes</i>

14:34.946 --> 14:37.423
and when you come back that's,

14:37.614 --> 14:39.472
that's when you see Billy in the water.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.948
<i>And that was about ten a.m.?</i>

14:44.104 --> 14:45.104
Yeah.

14:47.594 --> 14:48.722
Mrs. LaBelle,

14:49.982 --> 14:51.739
I spoke with your friend, uh,

14:52.931 --> 14:54.398
Rosalyn this morning,

14:54.432 --> 14:55.717
<i>Rosalyn Garret.</i>

14:57.636 --> 14:59.473
She was with you the
night before Billy died.

14:59.508 --> 15:00.719
Do you remember that?

15:00.835 --> 15:02.298
<i>You were at the legion together.</i>

15:03.711 --> 15:05.019
Sounds about right.

15:05.091 --> 15:06.614
And you stayed pretty late,

15:06.711 --> 15:08.029
closed the place down.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.202
<i>What's this got to do with Billy?</i>

15:10.315 --> 15:11.147
I'm just,

15:11.203 --> 15:12.965
I'm just trying to get
the timeline straight here.

15:13.035 --> 15:16.474
So up until two a.m., uh,

15:16.559 --> 15:18.355
having a good time and then

15:18.390 --> 15:20.457
first thing next morning

15:20.969 --> 15:22.566
with your son at the beach.

15:27.506 --> 15:28.792
Mrs. LaBelle,

15:29.601 --> 15:30.801
I couldn't help but notice

15:30.835 --> 15:32.803
in the pictures of the scene,

15:32.837 --> 15:34.705
<i>I didn't see anything like a blanket</i>

15:34.739 --> 15:37.031
<i>or a picnic basket.</i>

15:37.093 --> 15:38.409
Picnic basket?

15:38.490 --> 15:40.450
Sorry. I don't own a picnic basket.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.381
<i>Mrs. LaBelle, I know
this is difficult.</i>

15:44.416 --> 15:45.649
<i>I know you've been through a lot</i>

15:45.684 --> 15:48.118
<i>and I'm not here to
add to your pain.</i>

15:48.153 --> 15:49.429
My son is dead.

15:50.422 --> 15:51.993
What do you think you can add?

15:54.159 --> 15:56.961
<i>If you weren't with
him that morning,</i>

15:57.024 --> 15:58.662
<i>if you were sleeping it off</i>

15:58.697 --> 16:00.600
<i>and he was out there on his own,</i>

16:02.334 --> 16:03.756
<i>I need to know that.</i>

16:15.513 --> 16:16.853
I want you to go.

16:30.795 --> 16:33.145
Uh, McLeod, you got a minute?

16:33.227 --> 16:34.276
It's forensics on the line.

16:34.354 --> 16:36.188
I could use an extra brain in the room.

16:52.893 --> 16:54.124
Len, it's John.

16:54.586 --> 16:57.184
I've got, uh, Detective McLeod with me.

16:57.938 --> 16:59.305
We're ready when you are.

16:59.348 --> 17:01.690
<i>All right. It's all
very preliminary so</i>

17:01.725 --> 17:03.810
<i>bear with me.</i>

17:05.696 --> 17:06.763
Doctor?

17:06.798 --> 17:09.199
<i>Before you start, I wanted
to introduce myself.</i>

17:09.311 --> 17:10.893
<i>I'm Detective Lise Delorme.</i>

17:11.736 --> 17:13.503
I'm second on the case.

17:13.538 --> 17:15.406
You guys want to call me
back when you're all sorted?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.646
That's everyone, Len.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Go ahead.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.877
<i>Okay. A lot of animal predation so</i>

17:20.912 --> 17:23.213
there's lots we can't know but,

17:23.248 --> 17:25.348
wrists and ankles have ligature marks

17:25.383 --> 17:27.017
so she was tied up.

17:27.051 --> 17:29.635
<i>Petechial hemorrhaging
in her remaining eye</i>

17:29.728 --> 17:30.988
<i>shows that she suffocated,</i>

17:31.022 --> 17:33.023
<i>and we can thank the
ice for that detail.</i>

17:33.058 --> 17:34.091
<i>Strangled?</i>

17:34.125 --> 17:35.259
<i>Maybe.</i>

17:35.293 --> 17:37.361
<i>Not enough neck tissue to be sure.</i>

17:37.395 --> 17:38.862
Stomach, empty.

17:38.897 --> 17:41.398
She hadn't eaten in at
least twenty-four hours.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.067
<i>As for the killer,</i>

17:43.101 --> 17:44.068
<i>no blood,</i>

17:44.102 --> 17:45.102
<i>no hair.</i>

17:45.704 --> 17:49.740
<i>Toxicology is positive
for benzodiazepine</i>

17:49.774 --> 17:52.209
<i>but, and I can't say
this with certainty,</i>

17:52.243 --> 17:55.179
there's no indication of sexual activity.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.547
<i>Now her right eye,</i>

17:56.581 --> 17:58.182
<i>this is a little different,</i>

17:58.216 --> 17:59.416
<i>four abrasions,</i>

17:59.451 --> 18:01.085
<i>two upper, two lower.</i>

18:01.119 --> 18:03.387
<i>Leukotriene B4 is present</i>

18:03.421 --> 18:06.121
<i>and what that means is
that there's inflammation</i>

18:06.156 --> 18:08.956
<i>and, uh, those injuries
came before she died.</i>

18:09.034 --> 18:10.227
And what do you make of that?

18:10.261 --> 18:13.030
Could be some random injuries.

18:13.064 --> 18:14.898
Certainly can't rule that out.

18:14.933 --> 18:16.600
<i>Or they could be from a speculum</i>

18:16.634 --> 18:18.392
<i>to keep her eyes open.</i>

18:20.342 --> 18:23.177
<i>And that, for now, is
all that I have for you.</i>

18:28.216 --> 18:29.572
- Thanks, Len.
- <i>Sure.</i>

18:30.340 --> 18:31.106
Hmm.

18:31.302 --> 18:32.832
He wanted her to see him.

18:33.418 --> 18:35.052
Just like Billy LaBelle,

18:35.086 --> 18:36.086
face up in the water.

18:36.152 --> 18:37.739
Oh Jesus. Here we go.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.819
He tell you his repeater theory?

18:39.854 --> 18:41.989
Maureen LaBelle lied, Ian.

18:42.093 --> 18:44.395
Billy was unattended the morning he died.

18:44.429 --> 18:46.397
John, you want my advice?

18:46.431 --> 18:47.968
You have a victim.

18:48.036 --> 18:49.524
<i>Don't go looking for more.</i>

18:55.540 --> 18:57.056
Stay on the B&Es.

19:06.819 --> 19:07.819
<i>Mare?</i>

19:08.699 --> 19:11.219
I'm gonna need all the
uncleared missing person files

19:11.266 --> 19:12.356
dating back two years,

19:12.390 --> 19:13.824
starting with minors.

19:13.858 --> 19:16.261
You want locals or just passing through?

19:16.331 --> 19:17.604
All of them.

19:17.639 --> 19:19.636
- <i>And Mary, do me a favour.</i>
- Hmm?

19:19.738 --> 19:21.412
Keep this between us.

19:26.395 --> 19:28.131
<i>Hi. It's Detective John Cardinal</i>

19:28.201 --> 19:29.653
<i>with the Algonquin Bay Police.</i>

19:29.716 --> 19:31.827
<i>I'm calling about a missing person.</i>

19:31.889 --> 19:33.920
<i>Uh, yeah, thanks for
getting back to me.</i>

19:33.987 --> 19:35.654
<i>Question about a find...</i>

19:35.688 --> 19:37.089
Seventeen.

19:37.123 --> 19:38.524
<i>I'm wondering if there's any</i>

19:38.558 --> 19:39.591
<i>new information since?</i>

19:39.626 --> 19:41.527
<i>I see. So he was seen in St. John's?</i>

19:41.561 --> 19:43.587
<i>I'm gonna show you some pictures.</i>

19:43.666 --> 19:44.430
<i>Can you tell me if...?</i>

19:44.464 --> 19:45.790
<i>Well, if you hear anything more,</i>

19:45.845 --> 19:46.707
<i>will you let me know right away?</i>

19:46.769 --> 19:48.467
<i>Yeah. I know it's an
Alberta case but...</i>

19:48.501 --> 19:51.039
<i>I see, so there's a history of...</i>

19:51.102 --> 19:52.471
<i>Can you call me at this number</i>

19:52.505 --> 19:53.505
<i>when you have a minute?</i>

19:53.540 --> 19:56.204
<i>Yeah. Hi. It's
Detective John Cardinal.</i>

19:58.511 --> 19:59.778
<i>She may have been...</i>

20:09.814 --> 20:11.290
<i>Stir plate, gone.</i>

20:11.324 --> 20:13.192
<i>Grain mill, gone.</i>

20:13.226 --> 20:15.360
<i>Six brand new ball-lock kegs.</i>

20:15.503 --> 20:16.503
<i>He took them all.</i>

20:17.330 --> 20:18.897
<i>And insult to injury,</i>

20:18.932 --> 20:19.932
<i>look at this.</i>

20:22.123 --> 20:23.223
Didn't touch the beer.

20:23.336 --> 20:24.736
<i>Maybe he prefers lager.</i>

20:24.771 --> 20:26.538
I've won awards with this beer.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.296
He was a finalist once.

20:30.076 --> 20:31.383
I got a friend at the paper

20:31.437 --> 20:33.535
says, uh, houses are
getting robbed all over town.

20:33.570 --> 20:34.413
Is that true?

20:34.447 --> 20:35.814
<i>Let her do her job, Phil.</i>

20:35.849 --> 20:37.015
Says it's been going on for months

20:37.050 --> 20:38.517
and you guys are nowhere on it.

20:38.551 --> 20:41.687
Oh, I'm afraid I can't
talk about other cases.

20:41.721 --> 20:44.256
<i>Guess everyone'll be
focused on Katie Pine now.</i>

20:44.985 --> 20:46.619
<i>Kinda surprised you're here at all.</i>

20:49.195 --> 20:50.195
What goes there?

20:50.797 --> 20:51.797
<i>Microwave.</i>

20:52.398 --> 20:53.532
<i>I just got the thing.</i>

20:53.566 --> 20:55.400
<i>I didn't even get a
chance to install it.</i>

20:58.104 --> 20:59.104
And when was that?

21:00.039 --> 21:01.039
Wednesday.

21:02.442 --> 21:03.694
<i>Is that important?</i>

21:09.934 --> 21:11.855
<i>The fire will burn for four days</i>

21:11.951 --> 21:14.189
<i>while Katie's spirit
walks the world.</i>

21:24.399 --> 21:25.532
<i>Miss Pine,</i>

21:25.732 --> 21:29.234
I'm Noelle Dyson with
the Algonquin Bay Police.

21:29.269 --> 21:31.270
<i>I'm so sorry for what
you're going through.</i>

21:38.096 --> 21:39.096
I've, um,

21:40.613 --> 21:43.415
I've come with a message
from my fellow officers.

21:43.449 --> 21:45.160
I understand that you intend to give Katie

21:45.222 --> 21:47.653
a Christian service?

21:47.687 --> 21:48.687
That's right.

21:50.924 --> 21:52.724
<i>On behalf of the police</i>

21:52.759 --> 21:54.293
<i>and the mayor's office,</i>

21:54.327 --> 21:55.561
<i>we'd like to offer you the use</i>

21:55.595 --> 21:58.096
<i>of the St. Francis church.</i>

21:58.131 --> 21:59.754
<i>We'll cover the costs.</i>

22:01.547 --> 22:02.547
Why?

22:03.536 --> 22:05.137
<i>Miss Pine,</i>

22:05.171 --> 22:06.823
there are so many people

22:07.827 --> 22:09.461
feeling your pain right now.

22:11.344 --> 22:12.906
<i>I know that they
would be very grateful</i>

22:13.010 --> 22:15.626
<i>for an opportunity to
pay their respects.</i>

23:26.880 --> 23:28.758
<i>Oh, man.</i>

24:41.257 --> 24:43.759
<i>Good to see you too, Francis.</i>

24:43.863 --> 24:45.117
<i>What happened to your truck?</i>

24:45.170 --> 24:46.429
I hit a squirrel.

24:48.301 --> 24:49.647
Why so much this time?

24:51.537 --> 24:52.938
<i>You're not gonna count it?</i>

24:52.972 --> 24:54.139
I trust ya.

24:57.677 --> 24:59.304
Heard they found that dead girl.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.787
Night, Detective.

25:39.721 --> 25:41.272
Your phone is off again.

25:42.463 --> 25:44.064
<i>I have news on the B&E file.</i>

25:49.665 --> 25:50.973
<i>Well, this is nice.</i>

25:52.488 --> 25:53.906
What happened to your face?

25:56.253 --> 25:57.897
I was in the crawl space.

25:59.508 --> 26:00.741
I hit it on a pipe.

26:04.441 --> 26:05.943
<i>What's your news, Lise?</i>

26:08.774 --> 26:12.119
<i>Well, starts with a microwave oven,</i>

26:12.154 --> 26:13.587
<i>brand new,</i>

26:13.622 --> 26:15.923
<i>bought four days ago.</i>

26:15.957 --> 26:17.984
Stolen the night before last.

26:19.428 --> 26:21.562
Something about it rang a bell

26:21.596 --> 26:23.397
so I went back and checked.

26:23.432 --> 26:25.599
Every one of the B&Es,

26:25.634 --> 26:28.436
there's always something new stolen,

26:28.470 --> 26:29.904
a computer,

26:29.938 --> 26:31.172
a stereo,

26:31.206 --> 26:33.048
something right out of the box.

26:35.535 --> 26:38.099
<i>And all of them were
bought at one of the two</i>

26:38.170 --> 26:40.507
<i>big box electronics stores.</i>

26:40.570 --> 26:42.516
And what does that tell ya?

26:42.551 --> 26:45.177
Our thief is staking out these stores.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.279
<i>He follows his targets
home with their new stuff.</i>

26:48.314 --> 26:50.355
Then he hits their house later.

26:51.727 --> 26:52.869
<i>That's what you were doing</i>

26:52.939 --> 26:56.097
when I found you spacing out by the mall.

26:56.131 --> 26:58.099
You were looking for this guy.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.484
Hm.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.246
<i>Whenever somebody left
with a big ticket item,</i>

27:02.324 --> 27:03.870
I noted their licence plate

27:03.905 --> 27:05.973
and the licence plates of anyone

27:06.054 --> 27:07.673
<i>who followed them out of the lot.</i>

27:11.309 --> 27:13.023
There you go. Last night's victim.

27:14.201 --> 27:15.711
<i>Let's see here.</i>

27:16.847 --> 27:17.847
<i>Chu-cha-chu.</i>

27:20.379 --> 27:23.514
<i>Left 4:30 with his microwave.</i>

27:23.658 --> 27:25.693
<i>Followed out by five cars.</i>

27:25.727 --> 27:27.338
So one of these is our thief.

27:31.806 --> 27:33.036
- <i>There you go.</i>
- Hmm.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.537
When were you planning on sharing this?

27:36.836 --> 27:38.671
I didn't know it would amount to anything.

27:40.316 --> 27:41.796
I'll go meet the candidates.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.063
- <i>Delorme.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

27:50.174 --> 27:51.174
Check this out.

27:53.004 --> 27:53.971
<i>Who's he?</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:55.197
Malcolm Musgrave,

27:55.277 --> 27:56.752
RCMP Staff Sergeant.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.863
<i>To what do we owe the honour?</i>

27:58.918 --> 28:00.669
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

28:00.726 --> 28:01.778
I mean, there's a rumour

28:01.844 --> 28:03.538
our department's under investigation.

28:04.982 --> 28:05.982
What for?

28:06.017 --> 28:07.218
Well, if they brought in the horsemen,

28:07.272 --> 28:08.719
it's gotta be a dirty cop

28:08.753 --> 28:10.127
or we'd handle it internally.

28:15.091 --> 28:17.997
Well, that's just what we need right now.

28:26.514 --> 28:27.514
Oh.

28:28.126 --> 28:30.208
<i>This fellow here,</i>

28:30.286 --> 28:31.695
<i>yeah, yeah, he stayed with us.</i>

28:31.749 --> 28:33.098
<i>Todd Curry. You're sure?</i>

28:33.168 --> 28:33.691
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

28:33.726 --> 28:35.813
<i>Can you tell me, uh, when that was?</i>

28:35.847 --> 28:37.481
<i>Uh, you'll have to forgive me.</i>

28:37.563 --> 28:39.196
<i>We-we still do this by hand.</i>

28:40.515 --> 28:43.821
<i>We upgraded the system
a while ago but,</i>

28:43.855 --> 28:45.322
<i>I found our guests
weren't crazy about</i>

28:45.419 --> 28:46.878
<i>being keyed into a computer.</i>

28:46.957 --> 28:47.957
There we go.

28:52.725 --> 28:53.725
Let's see.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.381
Todd Curry.

28:56.461 --> 28:57.895
Stayed with us the night of

28:57.969 --> 28:59.354
January the 7th.

28:59.424 --> 29:00.170
Hasn't been back.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.447
Do you know where he was going?

29:01.510 --> 29:03.192
If he was travelling with anyone?

29:03.227 --> 29:03.807
<i>Well, like I say,</i>

29:03.842 --> 29:05.497
<i>we try to keep them fed and warm,</i>

29:05.564 --> 29:06.912
<i>no questions asked.</i>

29:08.642 --> 29:10.291
<i>I recognize you, don't I?</i>

29:11.417 --> 29:13.157
You attended service for a while?

29:15.635 --> 29:16.635
My wife and I.

29:17.531 --> 29:18.531
<i>Didn't stick.</i>

29:19.894 --> 29:22.325
<i>I figure it's best to keep my
attention where my work is,</i>

29:22.391 --> 29:24.037
right down here in the dirt.

29:24.734 --> 29:26.635
And your wife, um,

29:26.717 --> 29:28.017
Catherine Cardinal.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.099
Right?

29:29.367 --> 29:31.190
She came to us at a difficult time.

29:34.065 --> 29:36.901
I hope we were able to
provide some comfort.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.346
She wanted to believe
that faith could heal her

29:42.380 --> 29:43.380
and you let her.

29:48.502 --> 29:49.802
Keep 'em.

29:49.853 --> 29:52.287
If any of those kids come through,

29:52.338 --> 29:53.338
please call me.

29:54.508 --> 29:55.508
Right away.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.543
<i>Of course.</i>

30:24.342 --> 30:25.809
You look tired.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.282
You know what I need?

30:28.259 --> 30:29.228
Tea.

30:29.307 --> 30:31.675
From a Styrofoam cup.

30:31.796 --> 30:32.896
I need to call work,

30:32.931 --> 30:34.898
make sure everything's going okay.

30:34.933 --> 30:35.933
Catherine.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.403
I spoke to them last week.

30:39.516 --> 30:40.716
Your students are covered.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.039
Everything's good.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.274
We need more firewood at the house.

30:44.309 --> 30:45.843
I'll take care of it.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.911
Well, I gotta get in touch
with my dad about their visit.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.213
I can't remember if I did.

30:49.301 --> 30:50.301
Catherine.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.649
I should come home.

31:21.724 --> 31:22.724
Excuse me.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.368
We could have used all this manpower

31:25.403 --> 31:28.318
when Katie Pine was still alive.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.178
This isn't the time.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.837
The killer's still out there

31:31.872 --> 31:34.391
and you've got half
the force doing theatre.

31:34.426 --> 31:37.093
We are paying our respects
to a grieving mother.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.555
Is that what this is?

31:38.630 --> 31:39.630
Indeed.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.217
Dorothy Pine's not coming.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.611
Why?

32:30.295 --> 32:32.106
Maybe she had better things to do.

33:06.475 --> 33:08.526
<i>Detective, it's-it's
Father Presnell.</i>

33:08.612 --> 33:10.949
I-I was just, uh, speaking with one of our

33:10.984 --> 33:13.571
<i>volunteers who remembers Todd Curry.</i>

33:13.655 --> 33:15.796
<i>Turns out he did come back.</i>

33:15.831 --> 33:17.067
To stay.

33:17.102 --> 33:17.918
<i>No, no.</i>

33:17.981 --> 33:20.104
<i>He came to borrow a sleeping bag.</i>

33:20.138 --> 33:21.464
He found a place to squat.

33:21.518 --> 33:23.608
<i>One of the kids went to visit him.</i>

33:23.643 --> 33:24.786
You know where?

33:24.841 --> 33:26.418
<i>Uh, it's an abandoned house.</i>

33:26.453 --> 33:27.549
<i>Uh, from the description,</i>

33:27.619 --> 33:30.056
<i>it sounds like the one
on Sparhawk Street.</i>

33:30.090 --> 33:30.907
<i>Do you know that?</i>

33:30.954 --> 33:32.476
<i>Yeah, I do, I do.</i>

33:32.511 --> 33:33.511
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:56.283 --> 33:57.250
<i>First Billy LaBelle,</i>

33:57.284 --> 33:58.351
<i>and now Todd Curry.</i>

33:58.385 --> 33:59.403
<i>Seventeen years old,</i>

33:59.438 --> 34:01.032
<i>last seen at that address.</i>

34:01.067 --> 34:02.541
<i>If I can get in there,
have a look around,</i>

34:02.589 --> 34:04.291
<i>maybe I can track him down.</i>

34:06.380 --> 34:08.195
<i>No judge will grant this warrant.</i>

34:08.230 --> 34:10.150
They will if you back me.

34:10.219 --> 34:13.449
And when this kid shows up
alive and well, what then?

34:13.496 --> 34:14.634
<i>You gonna move down your list</i>

34:14.668 --> 34:17.156
<i>until you've cleared every
missing person in the province?</i>

34:17.233 --> 34:19.505
If this is real, we need to catch the guy

34:19.540 --> 34:22.375
and to catch the guy we
need to act like it's real.

34:24.552 --> 34:27.045
The Chief is considering handing Katie Pine

34:27.114 --> 34:28.429
<i>over to the OPD.</i>

34:28.464 --> 34:31.284
- What?
- We've got a murdered indigenous girl

34:31.318 --> 34:32.937
who has slipped through the cracks.

34:32.975 --> 34:34.697
<i>Everybody is watching.</i>

34:37.052 --> 34:39.719
I am trying to give you a chance here

34:40.221 --> 34:43.029
<i>but you are gonna have to work
the case that is in front of you</i>

34:43.063 --> 34:45.627
or you are going to lose it.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.710
Again.

34:49.929 --> 34:50.929
<i>So,</i>

34:52.063 --> 34:53.275
you decide.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.039
Get me the warrant.

35:21.505 --> 35:22.395
Hi.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.340
I'm Detective Delorme.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.606
I'm here about a noise complaint.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.445
<i>Okay.</i>

35:27.507 --> 35:28.608
Now we have reports...

35:28.693 --> 35:30.076
- <i>Hi.<i>
- <i>Hi.</i></i></i>

35:30.110 --> 35:31.677
<i>Of a loud engine sound.</i>

35:31.712 --> 35:33.532
<i>We're trying to locate the source.</i>

35:33.595 --> 35:35.281
Oh, no. We haven't heard
anything, Detective.

35:37.461 --> 35:38.461
Are you sure?

35:39.844 --> 35:41.187
Nothing unusual?

35:41.221 --> 35:42.321
<i>No.</i>

35:42.356 --> 35:45.958
<i>I mean a noise like that,
it'd wake the boy and then</i>

35:45.993 --> 35:48.113
we'd know about it, that's for sure.

35:49.796 --> 35:51.874
Is it just the two of you here?

35:51.932 --> 35:53.166
With the boy.

35:53.239 --> 35:54.973
Maybe someone else has heard something?

35:55.008 --> 35:56.708
No. Just us.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.919
I noticed all the skis.

36:01.782 --> 36:04.617
<i>Oh. Well, oh, they're mine.</i>

36:05.699 --> 36:07.181
Three different sizes.

36:07.977 --> 36:09.203
Different conditions.

36:13.093 --> 36:14.318
Well if you

36:15.188 --> 36:18.586
do hear that noise, Mr...?

36:20.639 --> 36:25.176
I will call you, Detective.

36:25.265 --> 36:26.927
Good luck with, uh,

36:26.985 --> 36:28.289
the noise complaint.

38:16.943 --> 38:17.798
<i>Cardinal.</i>

38:17.850 --> 38:19.611
Woodrow "Woody" Baldwin.

38:19.686 --> 38:22.948
He did three months in
Drumheller for auto theft.

38:22.983 --> 38:23.983
<i>He's our guy.</i>

38:24.053 --> 38:25.634
- <i>I can feel it.</i>
- Good work.

38:25.669 --> 38:27.086
<i>You should see him.</i>

38:27.400 --> 38:29.863
<i>Thinks he can charm his
way out of anything.</i>

38:30.625 --> 38:32.192
<i>All right, listen, well,</i>

38:32.492 --> 38:35.695
<i>we'll put a patrol on him.</i>

38:44.438 --> 38:45.879
Lise, I gotta call you back.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.999
<i>I'll call when I know more.</i>

39:54.034 --> 39:55.167
- McLeod.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

39:55.202 --> 39:57.216
Your three favourite
detectives on the OPD side.

39:57.251 --> 39:58.372
Grab a pen, write them down.

39:58.407 --> 39:59.202
We're gonna need help.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.959
- And I don't want their dregs.
- <i>Got it.</i>

40:00.994 --> 40:01.743
<i>Lise?</i>

40:01.777 --> 40:04.575
<i>Yeah? Yeah.</i>

40:04.610 --> 40:05.598
You're not coming on scene,

40:05.652 --> 40:06.877
you're needed elsewhere.

40:08.061 --> 40:10.029
- Now?
- Yeah. Now.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.309
Don't keep 'em waiting.

40:38.180 --> 40:39.225
<i>I'm sorry to pull you away.</i>

40:39.273 --> 40:41.274
<i>I know it's not a good time.</i>

40:41.917 --> 40:44.157
<i>He suspect anything?</i>

40:44.192 --> 40:46.148
<i>No. He's focused on Katie Pine.</i>

40:48.624 --> 40:49.624
Okay.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.849
I know it's early, but
give me your generals.

40:51.961 --> 40:53.387
Well, he's stubborn.

40:54.284 --> 40:55.284
Smart.

40:55.565 --> 40:57.671
Thinks he knows better.

40:57.745 --> 40:59.267
<i>He never would have
found that second body</i>

40:59.333 --> 41:01.937
<i>if he'd done what he was told.</i>

41:01.987 --> 41:02.987
<i>And?</i>

41:03.921 --> 41:04.921
<i>And...</i>

41:06.142 --> 41:07.976
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

41:16.118 --> 41:17.937
<i>What's discussed in here</i>

41:18.007 --> 41:20.388
<i>can't leave these walls.</i>

41:20.423 --> 41:22.457
<i>Not to your Sergeant,</i>

41:22.491 --> 41:24.226
<i>not to your spouse.</i>

41:24.260 --> 41:26.461
<i>Not even to members of my team.</i>

41:26.885 --> 41:27.885
<i>We clear?</i>

41:29.532 --> 41:31.750
<i>You'll know the name Kyle Corbett,</i>

41:31.844 --> 41:32.634
<i>Sudbury-based,</i>

41:32.668 --> 41:33.485
<i>came up in the 90's,</i>

41:33.555 --> 41:37.168
<i>controls the bulk of the
drug trade north of Toronto.</i>

41:37.270 --> 41:38.241
<i>Among his greatest hits,</i>

41:38.276 --> 41:41.887
<i>2011, he blew up a rival's
garage in Val-d'Or.</i>

41:41.922 --> 41:43.648
<i>Killed an
eleven-year-old boy.</i>

41:46.164 --> 41:48.783
We have reason to believe
that someone from our side

41:48.874 --> 41:51.019
is feeding Corbett information

41:51.054 --> 41:53.287
<i>and we believe that that person</i>

41:53.321 --> 41:55.257
<i>is Detective John Cardinal</i>

41:55.291 --> 41:57.759
<i>of the Algonquin Bay
Police Department.</i>

41:57.793 --> 41:59.648
<i>Delorme's been transferred
to Cardinal's section</i>

41:59.741 --> 42:00.766
<i>at my request.</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:02.297
<i>She's our inside guy.</i>

42:02.331 --> 42:05.033
<i>Hansen, I brought you in
to work the Sudbury side.</i>

42:05.141 --> 42:06.240
<i>The job</i>

42:06.353 --> 42:08.623
<i>is to draw a line between the two.</i>

42:08.704 --> 42:10.939
You find the link

42:10.973 --> 42:12.874
between Cardinal and Corbett.

42:12.908 --> 42:13.908
<i>Questions?</i>

42:15.256 --> 42:16.546
<i>You know John Cardinal?</i>

42:16.624 --> 42:18.118
Not well.

42:18.153 --> 42:19.948
<i>Do you think he's the
kind of guy who'd do this?</i>

42:24.798 --> 42:27.633
I don't find that question
to be especially useful.

42:29.572 --> 42:30.572
<i>Did he?</i>

42:32.640 --> 42:34.007
<i>That's all that matters.</i>
