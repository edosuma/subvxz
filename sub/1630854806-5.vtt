00:01.585 --> 00:03.212
Previously on
"The Watchful Eye"...

00:03.212 --> 00:05.297
I went to go see the Wards'
old nanny this morning,

00:05.297 --> 00:07.841
and she told me that she's
being watched all the time.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.928
I just need to know if I'm safe
working for this family.

00:10.928 --> 00:11.970
Mom asked me
to write a letter

00:11.970 --> 00:13.805
to the parole board
on her behalf.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.099
If she gets paroled,
I can get out of this shit hole.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.352
I found cameras
all over Matthew's apartment.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.395
Wish we could
spy on them.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.564
Roman was gonna bring it up,
but I was on my way.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.358
He had Arturo rush it.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.194
Uh, Arturo never
rushes anything.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.695
Thank you.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.280
Searched all
the common areas, and nothing.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.074
No gems, no clues.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.368
This place is starting
to push me to the edge.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.994
Jocelyn tells Alistair
that she suspects

00:35.994 --> 00:37.913
that Winthrop
stole her treasure.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.289
I want to thank
everyone for coming here today.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.125
My name is
Otis Winthrop the Third.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.504
And I am the CEO of
this Greybourne Corporation.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.965
We are so proud that
Matthew Ward and his firm

00:47.965 --> 00:50.592
have become an official
Greybourne subsidiary.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.719
Why is Daddy talking
to Mommy's friend?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.179
Mommy's friend?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.648
Okay.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.149
Hold it steady.
You got it?

01:06.149 --> 01:08.193
Yeah. I got it. Okay.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.989
Now, we're gonna go
on the count of three, okay?

01:11.989 --> 01:15.409
Yeah.
One, two, three.

01:19.955 --> 01:23.584
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:23.584 --> 01:26.962
♪ Happy birthday, dear... ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪

01:26.962 --> 01:30.090
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:30.090 --> 01:31.800
Make a wish, Mommy.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.845
I wish for
birthday hugs.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.431
Oh, go on. Get up there.
Go on.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.767
Come here. Oh! I love you.
I love you. I love you.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.145
I love you, Mommy.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.814
Happy birthday, Al.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.983
Sorry I can't
get out of this meeting.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.234
It's fine.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.902
That's what I love
about birthdays--

01:50.902 --> 01:52.237
They're just
regular days

01:52.237 --> 01:55.365
but with extra sparkle
for the birthday person.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.410
For everyone else,
it's just a Tuesday.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.454
Jasper and I
have big plans.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.997
Oh, well, let me guess.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.125
Um, same thing you did last year
and the year before that...

02:05.125 --> 02:07.794
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
...and the year before that
and the year before that?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.129
Yeah.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.672
You excited?

02:10.672 --> 02:11.757
Mwah.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.009
♪ We've ridden the stars ♪

02:14.009 --> 02:16.470
♪ We've seen everything ♪

02:16.470 --> 02:19.014
♪ From Saturn to Mars ♪

02:19.014 --> 02:21.475
♪ As much as it seems ♪

02:21.475 --> 02:23.352
♪ Like you own my heart ♪

02:23.352 --> 02:25.354
Which one
is your favorite?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.980
Um...

02:26.980 --> 02:28.815
That tiny, fast one.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.152
Ooh!
There he goes.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.905
So, were they really alive
before the dinosaurs?

02:34.905 --> 02:37.532
Uh-huh.
Isn't that crazy?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.625
Hey, Jas,
see if you can find

02:46.625 --> 02:48.919
eight tiny, fast jellyfish, okay?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.337
I'll be right over here
for a second.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.755
Okay, Mommy.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.721
Hey.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.972
What are you doing here?

03:00.972 --> 03:03.892
Came to wish you
happy birthday.

03:03.892 --> 03:08.146
And to see where things were at
with what we talked about.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.816
I haven't had a chance
to say anything yet.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.484
Come on.
You said you'd talk to him.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.777
I'm trying.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.862
Okay, well, can you try
a little harder?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.657
It's family, Scott.
They're complicated.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.868
Yeah, I know,
but you're not like them.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.203
I'll keep trying.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.913
Yeah.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.956
Okay.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.798
Who was that?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.801
Him?
Oh, just a friend of Mommy's.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.151
Did you just say
that's Mommy's friend?

03:54.151 --> 03:55.152
Yeah.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.156
Come on. Let's go play Legos
in your room.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.407
Hey. Elena?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.035
I'll be right in.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.537
Okay.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.461
Hey.
This is Detective Macedo.

04:12.461 --> 04:16.047
This is our nanny,
Elena Santos.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.467
Yeah. Yeah, we met
the night of the incident.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.843
It's nice
to see you again.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.012
Likewise.
Is everything okay?

04:22.012 --> 04:23.513
Yeah, I was just asking
Mr. Ward a few questions

04:23.513 --> 04:25.348
about the deceased,
Mr. Malo.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.350
Oh, I thought
the case was closed.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.977
Tying up
a few loose ends.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.854
Oh, it wasn't
ruled an accident?

04:30.854 --> 04:33.106
Wanted to see if anyone
might've been having
any problems with him,

04:33.106 --> 04:34.649
see if anyone
suspected foul play,

04:34.649 --> 04:38.361
just any details that might've
slipped through the cracks.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.489
Uh, you sure I can't get you
coffee, anything like that?

04:40.489 --> 04:45.243
Uh, that'd be great,
but I-I should get going.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.078
I'll show you out, Detective.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.413
Whatever you need.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.998
Take care.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.249
Great place,
by the way.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.375
Thanks.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.591
Trying to scare me?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.510
You trying to remind me
that you can flash your badge

05:01.510 --> 05:02.928
and go
anywhere you want?

05:02.928 --> 05:04.429
You've been spending a lot
of time with this guy.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.097
Just thought I'd get a look
at him for myself.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.432
You jealous?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.517
No.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.852
Matthew is Jasper's dad.

05:10.852 --> 05:14.606
I can't avoid him.
This was your idea.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.525
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.652
Anything you think
I should know?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.111
No.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.113
You come here again,
and you'll regret it.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.620
Hey.
You heading out?

05:28.620 --> 05:31.915
No.
No, it's just me.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.416
Good to see you again, Detective.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.918
Yeah.
Have a nice day.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.340
That was a slick move.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.716
You coming to see me?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.510
Uh, no.
I'm going to see Darcy.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.096
Brought her this.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.597
What is it?
It's a necklace.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.141
I saw it, and it made me
think of her.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.102
Wow.
A necklace.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.395
Bold move.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.480
Wait, is it--
is it too much?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
I just think at the beginning
of something,

05:57.440 --> 06:00.694
it's good to not
come on too strong.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.279
Play a little
hard to get.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.780
But I'm not
hard to get.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.532
I'm extremely easy
to get.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.242
That's why you're playing
hard to get.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.286
It's a game.
You play it.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.580
Just let her fight
for you a little.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.373
It'll work.
I promise.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.500
And give her the necklace
on her birthday.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.934
Hey, you okay?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.936
Sorry if that was
triggering for you.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.606
It's fine.
He was just doing his job.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.941
Speaking of which, I didn't know
you were working so closely

06:39.941 --> 06:42.569
with Otis Winthrop
on this project.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.237
If you're asking if it's
his signature on the checks,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.196
then yeah.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.489
You know him?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.075
He runs the Greybourne
Corporation, right?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.869
Don't they call him
"The Bulldozer"?

06:50.869 --> 06:52.412
'Cause he buys cheap land
to develop

06:52.412 --> 06:54.289
and then he prices people
out of their own neighborhoods.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.498
Every developer
in Manhattan

06:55.498 --> 06:57.709
gets accused of corruption
at some point.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.420
Okay.
So everyone's doing it?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.133
You know, it's not easy getting
funding for these projects.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.011
I-I mean, if it wasn't for my
connection to the Greybournes,

07:08.011 --> 07:10.263
none of this happens,
and that's just the reality.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
Besides, Otis is family.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.810
His granddad is
Mrs. Ivey's uncle or something.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.604
It's a whole twisted
family tree there.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.819
You know,
there is, um--

07:24.819 --> 07:26.905
there is something else
I wanted to talk to you about.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.244
Tomorrow is...
Allie's birthday.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.248
Oh.
And between
all the books I read

07:37.248 --> 07:39.584
and the people
I talked to,

07:39.584 --> 07:43.338
no one seems to be able
to tell me...

07:43.338 --> 07:46.299
exactly how to handle it
with Jasper.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.426
There's probably
no right way.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.387
Exactly.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.223
I just-- I just want it
to be like any other day.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.767
Let me know
how I can help.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.769
Honestly, just you being here
is help enough.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.072
Hey.
What you building?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.824
Hagrid's cottage.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.785
Ah.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.704
"These bloody Muggles

08:15.704 --> 08:18.998
and their bloody
normal lives.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.376
Don't tell anyone
I told you that, Harry."

08:21.376 --> 08:24.045
You sound like Elmo.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.006
Ah.

08:27.006 --> 08:31.636
Hey, that guy that was here,
you said your mom knew him?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.555
Yeah.
He's her friend.

08:33.555 --> 08:36.599
They would go places sometimes.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.935
So you saw them together
more than once?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.815
Do more Hagrid.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.692
But so many people look alike

08:45.692 --> 08:47.861
in this big city.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.030
Are you sure it was him?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.116
Yeah, he's Mommy's
policeman friend.

would like some crepes?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.799
You're working today?

12:37.799 --> 12:41.219
It's just a regular
Tuesday, Tor.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.222

12:49.185 --> 12:52.272
Okay, so Jasper has tennis
at 10:00

12:52.272 --> 12:54.607
and then back here
for your math tutor

12:54.607 --> 12:56.150
and then out again
for a playdate

12:56.150 --> 12:57.860
with Athena
and Coriolanus.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.612
Are those children
or novels?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.156
You'll have to
ask their parents.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.409
Mwah.
Love you, buddy.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.410
Wait, Dad.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.828
Yeah, pal?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.664
Today is Wednesday,
not Tuesday.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.003
You're absolutely right.
Okay, go on.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.838
I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye, Dad.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.385
Mm.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.263
I can get that.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.224
I-I am just trying to control
one small thing

13:28.224 --> 13:31.394
in a universe of chaos, okay?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.396
Copy that.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.523
Thank you.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.112
What's up?

13:41.112 --> 13:43.489
Today's my mom's birthday.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.825
I know.
I heard.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.910
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to talk about it,

13:47.910 --> 13:51.622
but you want
to talk about it?

13:51.622 --> 13:54.876
We would always go to
the aquarium on her birthday.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.128
That must've been
really cool.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.380
You know, I remember
for my dad's birthday,

13:59.380 --> 14:02.008
my brother and I
would go to a Mets game,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.760
and we would eat
so many hot dogs

14:03.760 --> 14:05.303
and have
so much cotton candy,

14:05.303 --> 14:10.767
and then we would be so sick,
but it was so worth it.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.311
Me and my dad would always
get a confetti cupcake

14:13.311 --> 14:14.812
from Leo and Lucy's,

14:14.812 --> 14:17.940
and then we would put a candle
in it for breakfast.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.693
For breakfast?
A cupcake?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.404
What?!
That's my kind of breakfast.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.617
You know, we could still
do those things.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.494
We could still
go get a cupcake

14:29.494 --> 14:32.914
and go to the aquarium
and celebrate your mom.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.166
But only if you want.

14:35.166 --> 14:39.212
My dad doesn't like going
to the aquarium anymore.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.172
How about you think about what
you want to do and you tell me.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.632
Anything you want.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.592
We can go play
hide-and-go-seek.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.969
Last time, you couldn't
even find me.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.014
I was in the best spot
in the whole building.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.017
Yeah, I remember.
Where was that, anyway?

14:53.017 --> 14:55.895
What do you got stashed there?
Pirates' treasure?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
You got diamonds
and rubies in there?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.357
Gold?

14:59.357 --> 15:02.443
I promised my mom I would never,
ever tell anyone.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.529
It was our secret spot.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.990
Was it in the attic?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.118
I said
I wouldn't tell.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.994
You know what?
You're right.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.955
It's good
to have a secret.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.456
Race you
to get ice cream?

15:41.774 --> 15:45.153
Hmm. I thought I heard
someone out here.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.696
I have the afternoon off.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.823
You want to catch a movie
or something?

15:48.823 --> 15:50.575
What I wouldn't give to be
in a freezing-cold theater

15:50.575 --> 15:51.826
and eat my weight
in popcorn.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.162
Mm-hmm.
But I can't.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.455
It's Allie's birthday.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.541
How's Jasper?

15:58.541 --> 16:01.669
He said he and his mom used to
share this confetti cupcake

16:01.669 --> 16:04.922
from Baked by Leo and Lucy
every year on her birthday.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.799
And I really want
to grab him one,

16:06.799 --> 16:10.303
but there's no way I can make it
all the way downtown

16:10.303 --> 16:13.723
to that bakery in time
for his Mandarin lesson.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.854
Would you be able
to get some for me?

16:19.854 --> 16:21.022
Um...

16:21.022 --> 16:22.815
Only if you have time.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.901
And I would owe you
a thousand cupcakes.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.154
What would I do
with a thousand cupcakes?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.990
I will go, but you have to
answer one question first.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.408
Anything.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.161
The guy
in the elevator.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.246
Was that a question?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.165
I saw you at the bar with him
the other night.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.124
Who is he?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.961
He's a guy
I've been seeing.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.006
You have a boyfriend
and you didn't say anything?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.217
It's gotten
kind of complicated

16:49.217 --> 16:50.801
since I came
to the Greybourne,

16:50.801 --> 16:53.221
and he's keeping
a really big secret from me,

16:53.221 --> 16:55.348
and I'm struggling
with it.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.058
Well, secrets are poison, Elena.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.894
You got to talk to him.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.772
I'd almost rather not know
right now.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.273
I just want to focus
on making this day

17:04.273 --> 17:06.400
a little easier
for Jasper.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.236
I'm off.
Operation Cupcake.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.737
Bless you.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.575
Talk him him.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.988
Jasper?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.261
Yes.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.555
Oh, I assure you,
I'm very aware.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.933
And that being said, a little
gratitude goes a long way.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.893
Have you seen--
Shh.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.272
Okay.
That is all I'm asking.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.231
Thank you.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.194
Honey, you are looking
at one fantastic husband.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.446
You want to ask
why he's so fantastic?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.864
Can it wait?

20:39.864 --> 20:42.533
I-I don't know where I put
that blue peacock purse.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.869
You have 50 handbags, Tory.
Just choose another one.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.037
I don't want another one.
I want that one.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.289
It was Allie's.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.874
That's a little morbid,
isn't it?

20:49.874 --> 20:51.667
Can you just
help me look?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.675
Mrs. Ivey's apartment?
You really think it's in there?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.511
I-I searched everywhere else
that made sense,

21:02.511 --> 21:04.597
and we have to find
this ruby, Roman.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.266
If my mom gets out of jail
and gets to my brother

21:07.266 --> 21:09.727
and ruins his life
like she tried to ruin mine...

21:09.727 --> 21:12.521
Now we have a way in.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.065
It's right here,
under these stairs.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.609
But it's not
on this floor plan.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.486
You think someone else
knows about it?

21:18.486 --> 21:19.779
Somebody does.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.572
I don't know if it was
Mrs. Ivey or not,

21:21.572 --> 21:23.073
but I was in the stairway,
someone opened the door

21:23.073 --> 21:24.700
and was standing
right there.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.994
Oh, dude, I would have lost it
if Mrs. Ivey came for me.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.121
Alistair used to live
in Mrs. Ivey's apartment,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.207
so Jocelyn must have
used these stairs

21:31.207 --> 21:33.876
as a secret passageway to each
other so no one would know.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.294
Mrs. Ivey
is the only tenant

21:35.294 --> 21:37.630
who doesn't have a spare key
at the front desk.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.590
It's like she lives
in a fortress.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.384
And you only build a fortress if
you have something to protect.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.806
Let me see.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.557
Hello?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.978
Oh, great, you're back.
Are you ready to go?

21:52.978 --> 21:55.439
Go where?
The cemetery.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.775
We're all going together.
As a family.

21:57.775 --> 22:01.070
I-I thought
I sent an e-mail.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.030
Yeah, you did.
I didn't respond.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.283
Which I thought was
a very nice way of declining.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.452
It's Allie's birthday, Matthew.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.790
Now, Tory, I'm very much aware
of what today is.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.291
Thank you.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.085
But there is zero chance
of me dragging my son

22:16.085 --> 22:17.419
back to the place
where he watched them

22:17.419 --> 22:18.796
put his mother
in the ground.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.965
I'm sorry, but I disagree
with your approach.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.050
I think what Jasper--

22:23.050 --> 22:26.178
what we all need
is closure.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.638
Well,
you thought wrong.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.226
So do we
still have to go?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.520
Yes, Dick,
we still have to go.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.777
Hey.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.531
Sorry.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.617
I know it's rough what you guys
are going through.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.744
I guess it's all part of it, right?

22:53.372 --> 22:56.417
Alright, what's your take?
Am I wrong here?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.377
I don't want
to overstep.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.463
No, come on.
I value your opinion.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.090
Honestly.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.551
I don't think Tory
has bad intentions.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.511
I think everyone has
different ways of grieving

23:07.511 --> 23:09.054
and remembering
someone they love,

23:09.054 --> 23:11.348
and they're different,
but they're not wrong.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.184
Right, so how come I have to
default to her way of grieving?

23:14.184 --> 23:16.228
Well, you don't,
but for what it's worth,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.479
when my dad
passed away--

23:17.479 --> 23:19.481
Your dad?

23:19.481 --> 23:20.900
Wait, you lost
your father, too?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.571
Yeah.
A while back.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.867
He took his own life.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.286
Like Allie.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.789
And my mom found
any possible distraction,

23:35.789 --> 23:39.168
anything so she didn't
have to feel the pain.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.462
She just shoved
all her feelings down,

23:41.462 --> 23:44.840
and that made it really hard
for me and my brother to cope.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.092
She should have helped us
through it,

23:47.092 --> 23:50.012
but she was
same as you.

23:50.012 --> 23:54.850
She didn't know what to do,
so she did nothing.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.977
I don't know if you
can see this, Matthew,

23:56.977 --> 24:00.105
but Tory's not okay.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.151

acknowledging her pain.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.086

at a blank screen.

So why are we

24:26.382 --> 24:27.883
Elena asked me
to pick some up.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.760
They are for Jasper.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.762
How come Elena couldn't
get them herself?

24:31.762 --> 24:34.723
She needed the help.

Yeah.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.860
No.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.237
It's weird, right?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.280

and she didn't mention it?

25:01.375 --> 25:04.003

What plan? What happened?

27:13.757 --> 27:15.592
I took your advice,
and now Darcy's pissed at me.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.010
I ignored her texts
like you said,

27:17.010 --> 27:18.303
and n-now
she thinks I'm rude?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.179
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.014
I didn't say ignore her,
be rude.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.808
I just said
play it cool.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.434
What's the difference?

27:24.434 --> 27:26.061
The difference is somewhere
in between answering her texts

27:26.061 --> 27:27.479
and giving her a necklace.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.605
You know what?

27:28.605 --> 27:29.815
Don't listen
to a damn thing I say,

27:29.815 --> 27:31.984
'cause I clearly
don't know what I'm doing.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.277
Great.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.654
Next time, keep your
free advice to yourself.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.868
I feel bad about keeping you
from your writing day.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.704
I don't think you're really
keeping me from much.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.873
Are you really blocked,
or are you just procrastinating?

27:45.873 --> 27:47.624
What's the difference?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.629
Okay, I guess

27:52.629 --> 27:55.382
I just have doubts
that anyone would want to read

27:55.382 --> 27:58.510
any book
that I would want to write.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.096
I want to read your book.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.764
How does someone
like you exist

28:02.764 --> 28:04.224
in this crazy,
messed-up world?

28:04.224 --> 28:05.642
Oh.

28:05.642 --> 28:09.229
I am just as crazy and messed up
as everyone else.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.149
I'm just exceptionally cute,
so you don't really notice.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.362
Mm.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.947
Mm-hmm.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.825
Um, you got
a little frosting.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.201
Can I?

28:23.201 --> 28:24.328
Please.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.204
♪ I'm sick, yeah, I'm sick ♪

28:26.204 --> 28:27.539

28:27.539 --> 28:30.083

I'm getting high off it ♪

28:30.083 --> 28:31.209

28:34.087 --> 28:37.799
Ah.
You guys are the best.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.344
Thank you.

28:40.344 --> 28:43.305
Ginny, I will return this favor
in spades someday.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.306
Yes, you will.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.100
Okay, I'm gonna go.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.186
It's my writing day.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.273

Mind if I sit?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.413
Go ahead.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.042
Thanks for meeting me.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.051
When Allie and I
were little,

29:21.051 --> 29:25.931
we used to hang out here
every day after school...

29:25.931 --> 29:29.226
talk about everything.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.395
What we wanted to be
when we grew up,

29:31.395 --> 29:35.440
who we'd marry,
how many kids we'd have.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.990
This is where she told me that
the two of you were together.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.246
That's when I knew
you and I were really over.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.002
Whatever we were.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.840
Well,
if memory serves,

29:59.840 --> 30:01.383
the reason
we couldn't be anything

30:01.383 --> 30:02.926
is because
you were with Otis.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.851
We all have
our regrets.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.525
Anyway...

30:20.610 --> 30:24.197
We came here after
we buried our parents.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.745
We felt so alone,
but

30:29.745 --> 30:33.415
at least
we had each other.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.417
And we were sitting right here
when she told me

30:35.417 --> 30:36.877
that she was pregnant
with Jasper,

30:36.877 --> 30:40.088
and suddenly,
just like that, we--

30:40.088 --> 30:42.382
we felt hope
for the future again.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.681
And now I'm here alone.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.603
And I-I am so angry.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.692
I-I-I'm sorry, but I am.
I-I am so angry.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.529
I-I am angry at her
for leaving Jasper,

31:04.529 --> 31:06.239
for-- for leaving you.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.996
For leaving me.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.083
Look, I'm angry, too,
and I'm overwhelmed.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.213
I cannot let it out
or it will consume me.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.139
Ah.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.307
Look at us.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.102
We're a mess.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.646
Hmm.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.106
Look. Come here.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.984
At least
we're a together mess.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.694
Hmm.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.241
The tiny, fast one
is my favorite.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.535
Oh, she's so cute.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.496
Did you know that jellyfish
produce their own light?

31:54.496 --> 31:56.748
They do?

31:56.748 --> 31:59.376
Just like you.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.145
Is that a confetti cupcake
from Leo and Lucy's?

32:18.145 --> 32:19.813
- Dad!
- Hi, buddy.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.398
Oh, hey.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.444
Okay, come on.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.904
You know what?

32:27.904 --> 32:32.284
We have to be
very quiet, okay?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.661
Because I don't think we're
supposed to have food in here.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.037
It scares
the jellyfishes.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.790
Careful.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.959
Okay, ready?

32:45.338 --> 32:49.342

32:49.342 --> 32:51.928

33:04.649 --> 33:07.110
Oh, good job, good job,

Hi, honey.
How was your run?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.956
Oh. I'm sure it pales
in comparison

33:19.956 --> 33:21.625
to whatever you three
got up to.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.835
Oh, we weren't
up to much of anything.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.921
Well, whatever it was,
looks like you had a great time.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.756
So nice
you could be together.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.968
And we got Chinese food.

33:31.968 --> 33:36.514
Yum! Did you happen to get
your uncle some pork lo mein?

33:36.514 --> 33:38.558
Uh, I was just gonna
have an egg roll

33:38.558 --> 33:40.268
and then grab dinner
with you.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.146
Oh, I want to have Chinese food
with Matthew and Jasper.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.814
If they don't mind sharing.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.651
Yeah. Plenty of spicy
Szechuan shrimp for everybody.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.903
Ah, well, in that case,
I'll have to pass,

33:49.903 --> 33:52.989
unless you want to watch me
go into anaphylactic shock.

33:52.989 --> 33:56.618
I'm deathly allergic
to shellfish, so...

33:56.618 --> 33:58.203
Did not know that.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.830
Well, how could you?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.883
Why don't we go
to Nicola's?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.635
No shrimp.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.971
My treat.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.681
Well, we do have something
to celebrate.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.475
What's that?

34:20.475 --> 34:24.062
That, uh,
call I was on earlier?

34:24.062 --> 34:26.314
It was with
your old pal Otis.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.276
Trip?
Why would he--

34:29.276 --> 34:30.694
What did he have to say?

34:30.694 --> 34:32.112
He wants
to sit down with me.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.989
About what?

34:33.989 --> 34:37.742
Filling a seat
on the Greybourne board.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.536
He said that?
Mm-hmm.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.662
I spoke to him.

34:40.662 --> 34:44.207
I-I made my case
the way I told you.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.126
Mm.
And he said he wants
to discuss it with me

34:46.126 --> 34:49.254
next week
at the Save New York gala.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.007
Huh.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.801
I thought this was something
that you wanted for me.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.469
For us.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.763
We'll finally get to have a say
in what happens in the company,

34:58.763 --> 35:00.140
not to mention this building
that we live in.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.891
Yes.
Yes, I know.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.393
And-- And you're right.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.604
I-I'm just...

35:05.604 --> 35:06.896
surprised.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.106
You're surprised
that he'd want me?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.774
No.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.943
No, that's--
that's not what I meant.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.153
I--

35:14.988 --> 35:18.617
I am really happy
for you.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.244
I am.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.330
See? Silver lining
to everything,

35:23.330 --> 35:25.123
even days like today.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.207
Hmm?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.878
Let's go grab
that dinner.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.592
And that's the end of Round 7.

35:35.592 --> 35:39.137
Hey. You're back.
Before I woke up--

35:39.137 --> 35:41.431
What's this?

35:41.431 --> 35:43.224
You know her.
Where'd you find that?

35:43.224 --> 35:45.810
You know Allie this entire time
and you said nothing.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.145
Elena, this--

35:47.145 --> 35:48.980
Were you sleeping with her?
What?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.398
Were you trying
to break up their marriage

35:50.398 --> 35:51.775
so that you could
get the money?

35:51.775 --> 35:52.859
Is-- Is that really
what you think?

35:52.859 --> 35:53.985
I don't know what I think.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.071
I know that you're a liar.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.365
Are you trying to set me up
for a fall?

35:58.365 --> 36:00.617
Huh?
Is any of this real?

36:00.617 --> 36:03.495
Do you even love me?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.246
You came into my life.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.040
You took advantage
of my grief.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.416
You know what was happening
with my family,

36:08.416 --> 36:09.793
and I fell for you.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.379
Elena, I promise you,
that is not how things happened.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.339
Then tell me,
how did they happen?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.091
How is it that you have
Allie's coroner's report

36:16.091 --> 36:17.550
hidden in your apartment?

36:20.345 --> 36:21.763
Did you kill her?

36:21.763 --> 36:24.349
What?

36:24.349 --> 36:25.392
Did you kill her?
No!

36:25.392 --> 36:26.893
No, I didn't kill her.
God, no.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.812
You really think I'd be capable
of doing something like that?

36:28.812 --> 36:30.939
I don't know what
you're capable of.
Hey, come on. Listen.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.357
Whatever it is
you think you know,

36:32.357 --> 36:34.192
I promise you,
that is not the case, okay?

36:34.192 --> 36:37.529
I didn't do any of those things.
Then tell me the truth.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.073
Or I'm gonna walk out that door
and I'm never coming back.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.704
Okay. Hey, hey. Listen.
Okay, so you were right, okay?

36:45.704 --> 36:48.415
I knew Allie.

36:48.415 --> 36:51.501
And she was special
to me.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.170
She was my cousin.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.964
Your cousin?

36:55.964 --> 36:57.799
Yeah.
She was my cousin.

36:57.799 --> 37:03.179
So-- So, technically,
I'm also a Greybourne.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.099
What?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.892
My grandmother
had this huge falling out

37:07.892 --> 37:09.936
with her brother
back in the day.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.688
Everyone hired lawyers.
Threats were made.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.398
As a result,
my entire side of the family

37:13.398 --> 37:15.191
was removed
from the family trust, okay?

37:15.191 --> 37:17.402
We were just cut out
from everything.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.696
So why doesn't anyone
recognize you?

37:19.696 --> 37:24.159
Because-- Because they
don't even know I exist.

37:24.159 --> 37:27.203
They haven't seen my mom
since she was a baby,

37:27.203 --> 37:28.955
and they don't know
about the miserable,

37:28.955 --> 37:30.582
bitter person
that she's become.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.209
She spent her entire life
feeling like she was robbed,

37:33.209 --> 37:35.545
and nobody's ever been able
to make things right for her.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.755
I need to fix that.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.882
Allie was trying
to help me.

37:38.882 --> 37:42.469
So then why didn't you just
tell me this in the beginning?

37:42.469 --> 37:45.680
Because the last person I told
wound up dead.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.182
That was Allie.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.814
So, yeah, when I saw you
at the police station

37:54.814 --> 37:56.691
and I heard your story,

37:56.691 --> 37:58.985
I knew you could
probably help me.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.820
And, yeah, I wanted
to take advantage of the fact

38:00.820 --> 38:02.947
that you already had
your own personal vendetta

38:02.947 --> 38:04.407
against the Greybourne
family, okay?

38:04.407 --> 38:06.493
I admit that.

38:06.493 --> 38:10.914
But, hey, since that day, I have
completely fallen for you.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.711
Okay, I love you.
You know that.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.129
I hope
that you know that.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.133
But that's it.
That-- That--

38:22.133 --> 38:23.593
This is my secret, okay?
That's it.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.136
You can do with it
whatever you want,

38:25.136 --> 38:26.179
but on my end,
this is it.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.931
There's no more
holding back.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.651
I just wish
you would've told me.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.571
Yeah, well, I should've
done a lot of things.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.830
Well,
if we're coming clean...

38:53.998 --> 38:55.917
...there's something
I haven't told you about.

38:58.503 --> 39:02.090
I didn't say anything earlier
because I wasn't exactly sure

39:02.090 --> 39:04.175
what it is.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.428
I still don't know
what it is,

39:07.428 --> 39:09.848
but I know Alistair
was up to something.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.558
Yeah? What makes you think
it was Alistair?

39:13.142 --> 39:14.269
I'll show you.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.454
Okay,
so what am I looking at?

39:33.454 --> 39:37.208
This isn't--
This isn't right.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.626
This isn't real.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.090
This whole room.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.718
I was just in here,
and there was--

39:46.718 --> 39:49.512
there was a table here...

39:49.512 --> 39:52.056
and there were chairs,

39:52.056 --> 39:54.934
and there was a-- there was a
painting of Alistair right here,

39:54.934 --> 39:57.604
and there were paintings
of all of his cronies,

39:57.604 --> 39:58.938
and this was--
this was used

39:58.938 --> 40:00.690
as some kind of meeting room,
I'm sure of it.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.025
There was--
Over here, there was--

40:02.025 --> 40:04.777
there was a wallpaper
with these flowers,

40:04.777 --> 40:09.866
and there were, like, these eyes
hidden in the flowers.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.704
No.

40:14.704 --> 40:17.582
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

40:19.334 --> 40:21.920
There was--
There was a compartment here,

40:21.920 --> 40:24.297
and this is where I found
the box of letters.

40:24.297 --> 40:25.840
And it was--
it was all here.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.467
I-I swear.

40:31.387 --> 40:34.349
I-- It was all here.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.808
I'm sure of it.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.441
Please don't look at me
like that.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.776
Please.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.194
I'm telling the truth.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.071
It was all here.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.031
Just tell me
that you believe me.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.538
It was all here.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.168
Yeah,
I believe you.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.566
Oh, no. Teo.
