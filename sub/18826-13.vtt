I said her invention is,

14:31.417 --> 14:35.792
"None of your business,

14:31.417 --> 14:35.792
butler dude."

14:35.834 --> 14:38.041
- Wait, that was weird.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.834
Why would Carmichael want to

14:38.083 --> 14:40.834
know what Simone's invention is?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.291
- Maybe he wants to steal

14:40.875 --> 14:43.291
her idea.

14:43.333 --> 14:47.625
- I mean, she did say someone

14:43.333 --> 14:47.625
stole her ideas in the past.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.125
- The butler did it!

14:49.166 --> 14:51.166
- That's what we're saying,

14:49.166 --> 14:51.166
Dicky.

14:51.208 --> 14:54.667
- No. I just finished

14:51.208 --> 14:54.667
this mystery novel.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.417
"The Butler Did It."

14:57.458 --> 15:01.041

15:05.125 --> 15:07.792

15:07.834 --> 15:10.625
- If Carmichael's the one who's

15:07.834 --> 15:10.625
been stealing Simone's ideas,

15:10.667 --> 15:12.875
we have to tell Nicky.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.625
- Ah, well, I'm off to test

15:12.917 --> 15:15.625

15:15.667 --> 15:17.583
Oh, I'll give you a hint.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.000
[whispers]

15:23.583 --> 15:27.000
It's the dance suit.

15:27.041 --> 15:29.542
- Nicky, there's something

15:27.041 --> 15:29.542
we have to tell you.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.792
- We think the butler's

15:29.583 --> 15:32.792
about to steal Simone's idea.

15:32.834 --> 15:35.625
- Carmichael?

15:32.834 --> 15:35.625
He's a mensch.

15:35.667 --> 15:39.917
- That's Yiddish for a person

15:35.667 --> 15:39.917
of integrity and honor.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.500
- Hey, don't you want

15:39.959 --> 15:42.500
to protect your friend Simone?

15:42.542 --> 15:45.542
- Oh, I see.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.542
You're all just jealous.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.208
I don't have time for this.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.917
I must dance.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.792
- If Nicky's not going

15:53.083 --> 15:55.792
to tell Simone, we have to.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.291
- Why would we want

15:55.834 --> 15:57.291
to help her?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.583
She obviously doesn't care

15:57.333 --> 15:59.583
about us.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.041
- But you heard what Mom said.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.333
How would we feel

16:01.083 --> 16:03.333
if we were Simone?

16:03.375 --> 16:04.792
Would you want

16:03.375 --> 16:04.792
your idea stolen

16:04.834 --> 16:06.250
or would you want someone

16:04.834 --> 16:06.250
to warn you?

16:06.291 --> 16:09.250
- [sighs]

16:06.291 --> 16:09.250
Fine.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.792
Dicky, you coming?

16:10.834 --> 16:13.834
- Nah. I just started

16:10.834 --> 16:13.834
a new mystery novel.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.542
- "The Butler Did It."

16:17.583 --> 16:19.667
- Oh, man. Again?

16:19.709 --> 16:21.875
- The butler always does it.

16:21.917 --> 16:26.750
That's why they're called

16:21.917 --> 16:26.750
"The Butler Did It Mysteries."

16:26.792 --> 16:29.375

16:34.917 --> 16:38.250

17:01.458 --> 17:03.125
better than him?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.834
- Sadly, yes.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.291
- Okay,

17:08.041 --> 17:10.291
so what do we do now?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.041
- Well, since Nicky

17:10.333 --> 17:12.041
won't back us up

17:12.083 --> 17:14.041
when we tell her

17:12.083 --> 17:14.041
about Carmichael,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.291
we're just gonna need to hide

Let's just hide

17:18.917 --> 17:20.792

17:24.250 --> 17:26.709
- No. Am I?

17:26.750 --> 17:29.250
- No.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.250
- I can't see either of you.

17:29.291 --> 17:33.125
- Dicky, turn around.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.041
- Oh.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.959
- These aren't

17:35.083 --> 17:36.959
the right suits.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.917
- Ooohh, someone's coming.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.959
- So, ready to try out

17:44.250 --> 17:46.959
my dance suit?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.500
I have to say, it's way better

17:47.000 --> 17:49.500
than my last invention:

17:49.542 --> 17:52.792
emotion-activated safety suits

17:49.542 --> 17:52.792
that inflate like airbags.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.542
They were a total fail.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.208
They're right...

17:57.250 --> 18:00.667
Huh, I could have sworn

17:57.250 --> 18:00.667
I hung them right there.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.250
- Did you hear that?

18:00.709 --> 18:03.250
These are airbag suits

18:03.291 --> 18:06.417
and they're motion-activated,

18:03.291 --> 18:06.417
so don't move anything.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.166
- They were supposed to be

18:06.458 --> 18:08.166
activated by fear,

18:08.208 --> 18:10.250
like before an accident,

18:08.208 --> 18:10.250
but they're over-sensitive

18:10.291 --> 18:12.208
and any emotion

18:10.291 --> 18:12.208
sets them off.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.750
- She didn't say

18:12.250 --> 18:14.750
motion-activated.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.083
She said<i> emotion-activated.</i>

18:17.125 --> 18:18.875
- Then don't feel anything.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.583
- But you sound angry.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.583
- I'm not angry!

18:22.625 --> 18:24.750
- So, ready to dance?

18:24.792 --> 18:27.000
- Well, I-I thought I was,

18:27.041 --> 18:29.959
but now that

18:27.041 --> 18:29.959
I think about it,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.959
I'm not so sure.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.959
- What? Why?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.834
- Well, your stuff's cool

18:34.000 --> 18:35.834

18:35.875 --> 18:38.875
but it just doesn't feel right

18:35.875 --> 18:38.875

18:38.917 --> 18:42.542

They kept your secret

18:46.333 --> 18:48.208

18:50.208 --> 18:51.792

19:15.208 --> 19:17.959
your dance suit idea too.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.417
- He tried to get it out of us,

19:39.208 --> 19:43.250
in Dutch,<i> hallo.</i>

a butler dude.

19:46.417 --> 19:47.875
He's my father dude.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.375
- So the butler didn't do it.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.750
- Congratulations.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.250
The last few days

19:51.792 --> 19:53.250

19:53.291 --> 19:55.000

19:55.041 --> 19:56.250
- What?

19:55.041 --> 19:56.250
- What do you mean?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.250
- A test?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.250
- Colors can fly?

19:58.291 --> 20:00.083
- And he's back.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.792
kids I've hung out with

20:01.834 --> 20:03.709

I'm secretly afraid of cats.

Or what boy

You can tell me.

I think she has a crush

20:25.125 --> 20:29.208

20:29.250 --> 20:31.583
- So this whole thing

20:29.250 --> 20:31.583
was a test?

20:31.625 --> 20:34.792
- Yes. And you passed.
