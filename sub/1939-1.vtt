04:01.532 --> 04:03.283
My name is Alice.

04:03.283 --> 04:06.536
I worked for Umbrella Corporation
in a secret laboratory

04:06.536 --> 04:09.456
developing experimental viral weaponry.

04:09.456 --> 04:11.124
There was an incident.

04:11.124 --> 04:12.584
A virus escaped.

04:12.584 --> 04:14.753
Everybody died.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.589
Trouble was...

04:17.882 --> 04:19.925
...they didn't stay dead.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.845
This was the start of an apocalypse
that would sweep the entire world.

04:23.845 --> 04:27.349
The men responsible for this
disaster took refuge underground

04:27.349 --> 04:30.852
and continued to experiment
with the deadly T-Virus.

04:30.852 --> 04:34.356
They felt secure
in their high-tech fortress.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.942
But they were wrong.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.552
Biohazard terminated.

05:03.552 --> 05:05.220
Central Shibuya.

05:05.220 --> 05:06.180
Confirm?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.809
I confirm.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.147
Nice shooting.

05:15.147 --> 05:17.691
And I lead three to one.

05:17.691 --> 05:19.443
The night is young.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.278
Plenty more fish in the--

05:23.740 --> 05:25.657
Toshi, are you okay?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.785
Toshi, where are you?

06:25.885 --> 06:28.637
Sentry three respond.

06:29.347 --> 06:33.517
We lost contact with another one.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.104
- Chairman Wesker.
- Report.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.524
Sir, a half-hour ago,
we began to lose contact

06:40.524 --> 06:42.859
with some of our perimeter sentries.

06:42.859 --> 06:45.904
How many have we lost?
All of them.

06:45.904 --> 06:48.490
And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?

06:48.490 --> 06:52.536
We thought it was a communications
problem. I didn't want to disturb you.

06:52.536 --> 06:54.788
Give me the surface gate.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.628
This is Chairman Wesker.
: Sir.

07:01.628 --> 07:03.046
Report your situation.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.631
Everything is quiet here.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.258
No sign of intruders?

07:08.093 --> 07:11.388
Hotaka.
- We have movement.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.224
Multiple targets.

07:14.224 --> 07:16.143
Surface gate, identify targets.

07:16.143 --> 07:18.061
Repeat, identify targets.

07:18.061 --> 07:20.439
Sir, Elevator 2 is moving.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.482
I want security at that entrance.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.350
Hey, boys.

10:02.893 --> 10:06.229
Is that any way to treat a Lady?

10:21.203 --> 10:25.290
Tell security to flood the
main entrance with nerve gas.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.419
Sir, our men are still up there.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.842
Any more questions?

10:37.470 --> 10:41.014
Intruders in Sectors 1 through 5,
7 and 8.

10:41.014 --> 10:43.308
Reports of gunfire
in Sectors 10 and 11.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.647
Stay at your stations.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.274
All security protocols
are now in full effect.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.068
Lock down all elevators.

10:53.068 --> 10:56.446
Seal all internal blast doors.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.407
And I want damage reports.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.079
Come on, move.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.166
- Go, go. Everybody--
- Get out.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.012
Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.059
Turbulence. Turbulence.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.576
Turbulence. Turb--

15:27.593 --> 15:29.761
Any last words?

15:42.858 --> 15:45.151
How nice to finally meet the real you.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.072
Hurts, doesn't it?

15:49.573 --> 15:52.241
Well, that's just the start
of the bad news.

15:52.241 --> 15:54.369
All those powers of yours:

15:54.369 --> 15:58.456
Speed, strength, accelerated healing.

15:58.874 --> 16:02.877
Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.
What have you done?

16:02.877 --> 16:07.507
The serum I have injected you with is
neutralizing the T cells within your body.

16:07.507 --> 16:09.634
Put simply...

16:10.135 --> 16:13.680
the Umbrella Corporation
is taking back its property.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.308
You just didn't work out,
so you're being recalled.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.867
I am what you used to be.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.161
Only better.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.746
Please wait.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.456
Last words?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.084
Thank you.

16:43.084 --> 16:44.919
For killing you?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.880
For making me human again.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.301
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.

16:52.301 --> 16:54.345
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.371
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

18:02.371 --> 18:03.706
There is no infection.

18:03.706 --> 18:06.542
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.340
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.716
There is no infection.

18:15.468 --> 18:17.553
While I took revenge on Umbrella,

18:17.553 --> 18:21.140
the last handful of survivors
took a chopper to safety.

18:21.140 --> 18:24.519
They were headed for a town
in Alaska called Arcadia.

18:24.519 --> 18:27.021
We'd received radio transmissions from there.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.316
They offered food and shelter,
safety and security.

18:30.316 --> 18:34.153
A haven, free of infection.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.044
May 3rd, 1600 hours.

18:50.044 --> 18:53.047
A hundred and seventy-seven days
without signs of life.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.010
I am at 58.37 degrees north,

18:58.010 --> 19:01.389
134.58 degrees west.

19:01.389 --> 19:07.145
Closing in on the coordinates for
Arcadia, but no signs of it on any map.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.232
I hope Claire and the others made it.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.966
You're not coming?

21:41.966 --> 21:43.634
Take care of the others.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.053
Good luck, K-Mart.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.598
Claire.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.677
May 3rd.

22:26.677 --> 22:28.679
1930 hours.

22:28.679 --> 22:30.806
Arcadia.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.684
No such place exists.

22:33.684 --> 22:36.312
Just an empty field.

22:36.646 --> 22:37.855
And a beach.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.319
But we all heard the transmissions.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.613
Someone must have sent them.

22:45.613 --> 22:50.242
Someone must have brought
all these people here.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.662
But why?

22:54.790 --> 22:56.791
And where did they go?

23:01.213 --> 23:04.298
Day 177. Signing off.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.971
I don't know
if I can do this much longer.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.058
What if I am the last one?

23:14.058 --> 23:16.477
What if there is no one else?

23:17.687 --> 23:20.231
No one to watch these tapes.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.568
Is this my punishment

23:24.820 --> 23:26.779
for letting all this happen?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.827
Hey. Wait.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.375
Wait, please. Stop.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.089
Hello.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.634
Hello?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.471
Answer me.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.247
Hey, hey.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.457
It's okay.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.336
Sorry about that.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.798
But I had to get this thing off of you.

25:50.798 --> 25:52.049
What is this?

25:52.049 --> 25:53.551
Who did this to you?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.932
Do you even know who I am?

26:04.020 --> 26:06.355
My name is Alice.

26:07.148 --> 26:10.109
We met in the Nevada desert 18 months ago.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.069
Any of this sound familiar?

26:13.363 --> 26:16.115
Mikey, Carlos, L.J.?

26:16.115 --> 26:17.992
K-Mart?

26:19.452 --> 26:20.869
You left in a helicopter

26:20.869 --> 26:23.914
with a group of survivors
headed for Alaska.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.834
Arcadia, remember?

26:33.466 --> 26:35.968
Arcadia, remember?

26:37.512 --> 26:40.055
Arcadia, remember?

27:03.955 --> 27:06.206
May 4th, 0800 hours.

27:06.206 --> 27:09.543
Potting a course for Prince Rupert
in British Columbia.

27:09.543 --> 27:12.880
I will pass Vancouver,
drop down to Seattle.

27:12.880 --> 27:18.636
After that, it's San Francisco and
the rest of the Western seaboard.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.518
My passenger is still as talkative as ever.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.605
Whatever that thing was,

27:29.605 --> 27:32.232
it was injecting her
with some sort of drug.

27:32.232 --> 27:35.235
Something that causes memory loss.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.073
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.298
Your name...

27:57.342 --> 27:59.510
is Alice, right?

27:59.928 --> 28:01.845
She speaks.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.307
Look, I am sorry about back there.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.977
I don't know what happened.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.440
I don't remember anything.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.695
I don't even know my name.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.072
It's Claire.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.992
Claire Redfield.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.912
Claire?

28:26.912 --> 28:28.706
Sound familiar?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.292
Not really.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.462
You will get used to it.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.592
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.

28:40.592 --> 28:43.929
We should get to know each other
a little better first.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.964
City of Angels.

29:24.637 --> 29:28.640
May 6th, 1800 hours, Los Angeles.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.059
No signs of life.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.978
Not even the undead.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.150
Some must have burnt with the city.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.861
But what about the rest?

29:56.377 --> 29:58.212
Oh, my God.

29:58.212 --> 29:59.671
What?

29:59.671 --> 30:01.507
Look over there.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.935
Damn.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.283
It's a plane.

30:28.283 --> 30:30.536
It's a plane.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.246
I knew it.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.917
I told you they would come.
Hey, we're down here. Hello.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.495
No way we're getting in there.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.836
Where is he going?

31:20.836 --> 31:22.254
Why is he flying away?

31:22.254 --> 31:24.298
It's not flying away.

31:24.298 --> 31:25.883
It's circling. Circling?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.637
Damn, he's low.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.098
Down.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.935
What the hell is he doing?

31:41.816 --> 31:43.317
He's going to land.

31:43.317 --> 31:46.153
He's going to land.
Get the stuff out of the way.

31:46.153 --> 31:47.571
Land?
Yeah.

31:47.571 --> 31:48.780
Land.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.618
That is one crazy son of a bitch.

31:53.911 --> 31:56.079
This may get a little rough.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.332
Then cut me loose.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.425
Thanks.

32:08.425 --> 32:10.844
Just don't do anything crazy, all right?

32:11.930 --> 32:15.015
Nothing as crazy
as what you have in mind.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.901
Come on, Kim, move it.
I am trying.

32:25.901 --> 32:27.152
Well, try.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.704
All right, hold on.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.168
Hurry, he's coming.

32:47.715 --> 32:48.757
Come on.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.349
Come on, pull it. Come on.
Come on, pull.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.021
Good. Good.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.689
Good work.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.858
That's it.

33:47.858 --> 33:49.693
Good job.

33:57.910 --> 34:01.246
Nice landing.
I think technically it's called crashing.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.502
Luther West.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.047
Alice. That's Claire.

34:11.549 --> 34:14.634
Luther West. A pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.851
Hi, my name's Crystal.
- No, no.

34:22.851 --> 34:26.146
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help us, right?

34:26.146 --> 34:28.273
Can you get us out?
You from Arcadia?

34:28.273 --> 34:30.567
What did you say?
Are you from Arcadia?

34:30.567 --> 34:33.652
What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said they'd help.

34:33.652 --> 34:36.156
There are survivors.
Civilization and safety.

34:36.156 --> 34:37.741
Infection free.

34:37.741 --> 34:39.242
So they sent you, right?

34:39.744 --> 34:41.036
No.

34:41.036 --> 34:44.039
But there are others out there like you?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.500
It's just us.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.376
There's to be no rescue?

34:48.710 --> 34:50.587
I am sorry.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.969
Sorry.
Look, don't take it so bad.

34:57.969 --> 34:59.888
They had their hopes up and...

34:59.888 --> 35:02.599
Thought you could take them
to the promised land.

35:02.599 --> 35:04.351
Angel Ortiz.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.436
That was some fine flying.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.105
Thanks.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.116
What's the prognosis?
She will live.

35:19.116 --> 35:20.784
Yeah.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.911
You know,

35:22.911 --> 35:24.579
I have the strangest feeling

35:24.579 --> 35:26.081
I know you.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.961
Yeah, I get that a lot.

35:30.961 --> 35:32.504
You're a sports fan, huh?

35:32.504 --> 35:34.881
Do you like basketball?

35:34.881 --> 35:36.091
Not really.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.468
No? Oh.

35:38.468 --> 35:41.221
Well, maybe just a fan

35:41.221 --> 35:43.014
of fine timepieces.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.812
Yeah.

35:48.812 --> 35:52.315
Luther here is our resident superstar.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.026
So tell me about Arcadia.

35:55.026 --> 35:56.695
What exactly do you know?

35:56.695 --> 35:58.780
Just from their transmissions.

35:58.780 --> 36:01.324
We have been receiving
their broadcast all week.

36:01.324 --> 36:04.911
Food and shelter, safety
and security, no infection.

36:04.911 --> 36:06.955
We thought they sent you.

36:06.955 --> 36:10.250
We have been launching flares
for days to get their attention.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.627
Flares?
- Yeah.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.089
Who's going to see flares from Alaska?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.300
Alaska?
Alaska?

36:18.300 --> 36:20.343
Arcadia. I have been there.

36:20.343 --> 36:23.471
It's in Alaska.
It's a town, or so we thought.

36:23.471 --> 36:25.265
A town?

36:25.558 --> 36:26.683
I don't think so.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.312
Take a look.

36:30.312 --> 36:32.230
At what?

36:37.028 --> 36:38.695
You see?

36:40.114 --> 36:42.032
It's not a town.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.535
It's a ship.

36:45.995 --> 36:49.122
I recorded this from the shortwave.

36:49.122 --> 36:51.625
This is
Arcadia, on the emergency frequency.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.418
There is no infection.

36:53.418 --> 36:56.046
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

36:56.046 --> 36:57.505
It's the same message we heard.

36:57.505 --> 37:00.383
They must have salled down the
coast, picking up survivors.

37:00.383 --> 37:03.970
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

37:06.014 --> 37:07.682
What is that?

37:07.682 --> 37:09.351
I don't know.

37:09.351 --> 37:11.895
That was the last we heard from them.

37:11.895 --> 37:14.314
Then it just stopped.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.275
That was two days ago.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.945
We have been sending up flares
on the hour.

37:19.945 --> 37:23.323
So when you arrived, of course,
we thought they sent you.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.250
Claire.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.044
That ship over there.

37:36.044 --> 37:37.879
That's Arcadia.

37:37.879 --> 37:39.339
I know.

37:39.715 --> 37:42.300
You remember?
I remember the beach.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.101
People were coming to help us.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.312
What happened?
Why didn't you go with the others?

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
I don't know.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.526
I can't remember.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.740
We have to get to that ship.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.660
We have to get to that ship.

39:29.241 --> 39:33.328
Welcome to your new home,
cell block B.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.378
Crystal's our cook.

39:41.378 --> 39:42.837
The menu's not extensive,

39:42.837 --> 39:45.507
but she is a master of what she does.

39:45.507 --> 39:47.675
Sorry I didn't bring better news.

39:47.675 --> 39:49.344
Get used to disappointment, right?

39:49.344 --> 39:51.554
That's what my agent used to say.

39:51.554 --> 39:53.264
Were you an actress?

39:53.641 --> 39:56.434
I came to Hollywood,
ended up waiting tables.

39:56.434 --> 39:59.479
Why are we waiting? Excuse
me. I am hungry. Thank you.

39:59.479 --> 40:01.731
Get out of here, man.
- Thank you.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.196
I met plenty of creeps
like him in my time.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.532
What's his story?

40:10.532 --> 40:13.743
Back in the world, he was some
kind of big movie producer.

40:13.743 --> 40:15.912
The boy's got a stick up his ass.

40:18.749 --> 40:23.002
Kim Yong used to intern for him. Still
hasn't figured the world has changed.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.726
That plane,
do you think it could still fly?

40:39.770 --> 40:42.730
It can fly, but it only seats two.

40:42.730 --> 40:44.566
So take us to Arcadia one at a time.

40:44.566 --> 40:47.610
Look, I think she was lucky
to land here once.

40:47.610 --> 40:50.697
Five or six times would be suicide.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.449
No offence.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.535
None taken.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.249
There has to be another way out.

41:01.249 --> 41:02.959
We have to get to that ship.

41:02.959 --> 41:05.170
Well, there is the--

41:08.716 --> 41:09.966
What?

41:09.966 --> 41:11.759
Nothing.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.638
Look, it would be a waste of your time.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.392
I have time to waste.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.982
When the shit hit the
fan, we took refuge in the prison.

41:25.982 --> 41:29.652
It seemed like it had
the biggest, strongest walls.

41:29.652 --> 41:32.572
The best chance
of keeping those things out.

41:33.032 --> 41:37.619
By the time we got here, the guards
and the inmates were already long gone.

41:37.619 --> 41:41.998
I guess when people
started eating one another,

41:42.333 --> 41:45.376
there wasn't much point
in keeping anybody locked up.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.505
We thought the place was abandoned,

41:48.964 --> 41:51.007
until we made a discovery.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.555
Wendell,

41:57.806 --> 41:59.516
time to take a break.

41:59.516 --> 42:02.560
It's about god-damn time.
I hate being down here.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.147
I am hearing movement in the walls.

42:06.147 --> 42:08.441
So let's check it out.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.486
I will be back in a minute.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.198
Come on.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.404
Name's Chris.

42:57.491 --> 43:00.410
You were the one flying that plane.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.663
How do you know that?

43:04.039 --> 43:07.375
Wendell isn't the only one that hears things.

43:08.127 --> 43:10.169
I am glad you made it.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.423
Maybe you can talk some sense
into these people.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.384
What do you mean?

43:18.387 --> 43:20.263
Isn't it obvious?

43:20.263 --> 43:21.431
I am not a prisoner.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.935
I shouldn't be in here.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.358
I was working with a military unit.

43:32.358 --> 43:35.737
We were using this place as a staging post.

43:36.572 --> 43:41.951
Things were already bad when the order
came through to release all the inmates.

43:42.369 --> 43:47.332
We needed as many people on the streets
as possible to fight those things.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.126
And it was chaos.

43:50.753 --> 43:54.213
We were pulling out and a gang
of the prisoners jumped me.

43:54.213 --> 43:56.841
I guess they thought I was a guard.

43:56.841 --> 44:00.553
I woke up, my unit was gone.

44:00.804 --> 44:03.014
I was in here.

44:03.014 --> 44:04.307
Their idea of a joke.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.770
You don't believe me.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.483
Do the others?

44:13.483 --> 44:16.444
You need to get me out of here.

44:16.444 --> 44:18.863
We're all trapped here.
That's true.

44:19.406 --> 44:21.616
But I can help you.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.618
Seen enough?

44:23.618 --> 44:25.620
You find anything?
No.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.456
I know a way out of this place.

44:34.004 --> 44:37.340
If you get me out of here,
I will do the same for you.

44:38.133 --> 44:40.510
You're going to need me.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.429
Have you checked
what he's talking about?

44:43.429 --> 44:45.264
His way out?

44:45.264 --> 44:49.310
He's not telling us shit till we let
him out. And I am not letting him out.

44:49.310 --> 44:50.561
The man is a killer.

44:50.561 --> 44:52.522
Really?
I can see it in his eyes.

44:52.522 --> 44:54.065
How can you be so sure?

44:54.065 --> 44:55.650
I know people.

44:55.650 --> 44:58.403
Interesting.
So tell me.

44:59.279 --> 45:01.572
What do you see
when you look into my eyes?

45:05.953 --> 45:07.370
Whoa.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.333
Holy shit.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.253
Girl's got to be prepared.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.174
What would you possibly want with those?

45:20.551 --> 45:21.884
It's a hobby.

45:22.511 --> 45:24.262
A hobby?

45:25.013 --> 45:26.305
All right.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.516
Well, I will see you in the morning.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.195
No sign of anyone on deck.

45:42.948 --> 45:45.408
Your friends are out there?

45:47.369 --> 45:49.120
I think so.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.664
You don't remember?

45:52.249 --> 45:54.041
It's coming back.

45:54.041 --> 45:56.085
Slowly.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.924
Nothing that makes any sense.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.280
We still have running water.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.073
That's very civilized.

47:49.073 --> 47:50.533
We do our best.

47:54.037 --> 47:55.329
It's cold.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.790
Our best only goes so far.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.251
These are for you.
Thank you.

48:02.421 --> 48:04.714
I guess I should leave you to it.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.007
I guess you should.

48:06.341 --> 48:07.508
I will be right outside.

48:07.508 --> 48:09.302
Thank you.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.115
Luther?

49:21.083 --> 49:23.292
Take it easy, honey. Move it.

49:23.627 --> 49:26.587
Okay, I am just going to
be on my way now.

49:26.587 --> 49:29.340
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.

49:29.340 --> 49:30.967
Get out of my sight.

50:01.790 --> 50:03.582
What is that smell?

50:03.582 --> 50:05.710
Must have burrowed up from the sewers.

50:06.086 --> 50:08.337
Wendell said he heard things moving.

50:08.337 --> 50:11.173
What? So these things
can just burst out anywhere?

50:11.550 --> 50:13.426
We got to get out of this place.

50:13.426 --> 50:15.261
Arcadia will send help.

50:15.261 --> 50:17.805
No one's coming to get us.
Okay? No one.

50:18.042 --> 50:20.418
We have to help ourselves.

50:20.418 --> 50:23.254
This plane that you have.
Won't hold everybody.

50:23.254 --> 50:25.048
Well, we can draw straws.
- No.

50:25.048 --> 50:28.134
We all get out of here
and no one gets left behind.

50:28.134 --> 50:29.510
Great.

50:29.510 --> 50:31.346
How are we going to do that?

50:31.346 --> 50:33.890
Walk out of here,
just single file?

50:33.890 --> 50:36.768
Are you crazy?

50:36.768 --> 50:39.604
They didn't want him getting out.
- He's dangerous.

50:39.604 --> 50:42.607
Angel, what do you think?

50:43.525 --> 50:45.568
I think we don't have much of a choice.

50:45.568 --> 50:47.237
This is insane.

50:47.237 --> 50:49.906
Crystal, Crystal, look
at me. What do you think?

50:49.906 --> 50:55.495
I mean, not even you're that dumb.
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.

50:55.871 --> 50:58.998
If this guy thinks he knows
a way out, I want to hear it.

50:58.998 --> 51:00.708
All right.

51:00.708 --> 51:02.669
Seriously?

51:03.379 --> 51:06.256
This is a mistake.

51:06.256 --> 51:09.550
This is a big mistake.
You better keep your eyes on him.

51:22.356 --> 51:25.024
I was wondering
how long it would take.

51:37.997 --> 51:39.163
Boo.
I--

51:39.163 --> 51:41.874
all right,
let's get the hell out of here.

51:45.087 --> 51:46.087
Claire?

51:46.087 --> 51:47.630
What?

51:50.968 --> 51:52.218
Claire, it's me.

51:57.391 --> 51:59.475
It's Chris.

52:02.479 --> 52:03.980
I don't know you.

52:03.980 --> 52:05.648
Claire.

52:05.899 --> 52:07.400
I am your brother, remember?

52:08.986 --> 52:11.654
What the hell's happened to you?

52:12.990 --> 52:14.240
It's okay.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.658
Let him go.

52:20.164 --> 52:22.790
Look, she suffered
some sort of memory loss.

52:22.790 --> 52:25.001
If you really are her brother,

52:25.001 --> 52:27.211
it will come back.

52:28.213 --> 52:30.506
All right, this is very touching.
I mean the family reunion.

52:31.175 --> 52:36.179
If we could just get a move on, please,
before we're all eaten the fuck alive.

52:45.481 --> 52:50.151
Behind those doors is a
UPV, urban pacification vehicle.

52:50.151 --> 52:52.904
The prison kept it
in case of a serious riot.

52:52.904 --> 52:57.533
Sixteen-wheeler, steel plate,
water cannon. It seats 20.

52:57.533 --> 52:59.660
Ten tons of fun.

52:59.660 --> 53:02.830
We roll on out in style,
drive right over them.

53:02.830 --> 53:06.167
The lock's jammed.
But we can cut through it.

53:06.502 --> 53:09.379
When we hit the coast,
we have to transfer to a boat.

53:09.379 --> 53:12.382
We're going to need more fire-power.
- I got you covered.

53:12.966 --> 53:16.219
When I was stationed here,
we used the basement as an armoury.

53:16.219 --> 53:18.596
It's got every weapon you can dream of.

53:18.596 --> 53:22.016
How do you know your unit
didn't take them with them?

53:22.016 --> 53:23.810
Because by the end

53:23.810 --> 53:27.188
there were more guns than
there were people to use them.

53:31.193 --> 53:33.403
You go get the guns. Luther.

53:36.949 --> 53:38.783
Oh, my God.

53:45.374 --> 53:47.125
What is this?

53:47.125 --> 53:49.961
They had pumps to keep the
water out of the foundations.

53:49.961 --> 53:51.629
When the electricity failed,

53:51.629 --> 53:54.757
some of the lower levels
started filling up.

53:54.757 --> 53:57.343
There's another two floors down there.

53:57.343 --> 53:59.679
And how far down is the armoury?

54:00.097 --> 54:01.889
All the way.

54:04.184 --> 54:05.977
Luther, come on.

54:06.562 --> 54:07.937
Get back. Get back.

54:14.987 --> 54:16.821
Where do you think you're going?

54:16.821 --> 54:19.407
I was a swim champ back in high school.

54:20.117 --> 54:22.785
Is that right?
Here.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.959
You're going to trust me with a gun?

54:30.419 --> 54:33.004
Yeah. Why not?

54:35.591 --> 54:37.592
Luther, just shoot that mother-fucker.

54:44.141 --> 54:46.142
What the fuck is that thing?

57:11.330 --> 57:12.288
All right.

57:12.664 --> 57:13.831
Let's go.

57:32.684 --> 57:34.602
Let's go.

57:59.795 --> 58:01.921
Nice.

58:16.395 --> 58:18.229
Damn.

58:35.997 --> 58:38.791
There must be
hundreds of them out there.

58:39.376 --> 58:41.669
We can't go back that way.

58:46.925 --> 58:49.301
Oh, shit.
What do you mean, "oh, shit"?

58:49.301 --> 58:51.554
What--?
What is this?

58:52.013 --> 58:53.264
What do you think it is?

58:53.264 --> 58:55.850
Don't tell me that thing
fits inside of there.

58:55.850 --> 58:57.893
Can you put this back together?

58:57.893 --> 59:00.187
Maybe, but it could take a week.

59:01.064 --> 59:02.398
What do we do now?

59:03.108 --> 59:04.650
I know.

59:10.198 --> 59:11.949
Bennett,

59:13.452 --> 59:15.327
what have you done?

59:21.835 --> 59:24.378
Luther,
we got to get out of here. Come on.

59:52.282 --> 59:53.282
Did you hear that?

59:58.997 --> 01:00:00.414
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:00:00.414 --> 01:00:02.291
What are we doing?
Getting out.

01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:04.335
But the others.
Fuck the others.

01:00:04.335 --> 01:00:06.086
Now, get on-board.

01:00:06.086 --> 01:00:08.297
Bennett, what are you doing?

01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:11.258
Hey.
Kim Yong. Don't do this.

01:00:11.258 --> 01:00:12.676
Open this door.

01:00:14.846 --> 01:00:16.222
Bennett, please.

01:00:21.228 --> 01:00:22.978
Bennett.

01:00:29.611 --> 01:00:30.986
Oh, shit.

01:00:32.614 --> 01:00:35.282
That's right, bitch. Fuck you.

01:00:39.996 --> 01:00:42.790
Yes. Yes.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.416
Son of a bitch.

01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:46.752
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

01:00:47.128 --> 01:00:49.630
He's headed for the Arcadia.

01:01:01.852 --> 01:01:03.060
Alice.

01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:25.749
Come on.

01:01:41.016 --> 01:01:42.391
Head for the shower block.

01:01:44.978 --> 01:01:47.062
Move.
I will meet you there.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.567
This thing has no power.

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:54.194
We won't need power.

01:01:58.533 --> 01:01:59.950
Oh, shit.

01:02:13.423 --> 01:02:15.257
Hold on.

01:02:23.934 --> 01:02:25.935
Hey, head to
the shower block. Go.

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:28.706
Over here.

01:04:18.548 --> 01:04:21.508
Are you all right?
I am fine. Thanks.

01:04:24.471 --> 01:04:27.222
This is some kind of joke, right?

01:04:27.222 --> 01:04:30.976
The tunnels lead to the sewers,
the sewers lead to the storm drain.

01:04:30.976 --> 01:04:33.437
This storm drain leads to the sea.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:36.440
It's our only chance.
I will take point.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.691
I got your back.

01:04:41.446 --> 01:04:42.696
Ladies.

01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:49.745
All right, you're next.

01:04:50.955 --> 01:04:53.624
I can't do it.
You can.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:56.001
Let's go.

01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:05.792
Aah.
Shh.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:07.169
Those things are close.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:13.716
We found a way out just down there.
The tunnels drop into a storm drain.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.219
Go. Be careful.

01:09:24.145 --> 01:09:25.354
Where's Kim Yong?

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.484
Go. Go.

01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:47.584
I knew you'd make it.

01:09:57.011 --> 01:09:58.804
Luther.

01:09:59.597 --> 01:10:00.764
Help.

01:10:05.103 --> 01:10:07.145
Luther.

01:10:11.776 --> 01:10:13.527
You can't help him now.

01:10:15.696 --> 01:10:17.364
We have to move on.

01:11:47.455 --> 01:11:49.748
No welcome party,
huh?

01:12:08.809 --> 01:12:10.977
It looks like Bennett made it.

01:12:13.105 --> 01:12:15.190
Let's check inside.

01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:35.877
Did you find anyone?
Nothing.

01:12:35.877 --> 01:12:39.464
I checked the crew
quarters. They're all gone.

01:12:39.464 --> 01:12:42.050
Looks like they left in a hurry.

01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:46.805
This is Arcadia,
broadcasting on the emergency frequency.

01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:51.101
There is no infection. We offer
safety and security, food and shelter.

01:12:52.812 --> 01:12:55.564
Fuel, power,
everything's running normally.

01:12:55.564 --> 01:12:56.815
Look at this.

01:12:56.815 --> 01:12:58.775
It's the ship's log.

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:01.444
The crew launched
the lifeboats three days ago.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:04.489
Exactly when the transmissions stopped.

01:13:04.489 --> 01:13:07.450
But it says there are
still 2000 survivors on-board.

01:13:15.209 --> 01:13:18.336
We have to search
every inch of this ship.

01:13:34.604 --> 01:13:36.354
Umbrella.

01:13:36.354 --> 01:13:38.273
Of course.

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:41.151
I remember them coming for us.

01:13:58.377 --> 01:14:03.673
This whole thing, Arcadia, was a lie.

01:14:04.008 --> 01:14:05.175
No, it's worse than that.

01:14:06.761 --> 01:14:07.969
It's a trap.

01:14:43.381 --> 01:14:45.423
Where is everybody?

01:14:49.095 --> 01:14:50.595
I don't understand.

01:14:58.854 --> 01:15:00.605
I think I do.

01:15:01.941 --> 01:15:03.692
They're underneath our feet.

01:15:10.783 --> 01:15:13.576
They're holding
survivors to experiment on them.

01:15:15.746 --> 01:15:17.122
Look.

01:15:17.998 --> 01:15:20.208
It's K-Mart. She's here.

01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:21.459
Bring them up.

01:15:22.712 --> 01:15:24.421
All of them.

01:15:43.691 --> 01:15:45.567
Here she is.

01:15:45.776 --> 01:15:46.776
K-Mart.

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:47.986
Get her out.

01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:55.702
K-Mart, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:15:55.702 --> 01:15:57.495
K-Mart, it's all right.

01:15:57.495 --> 01:15:59.748
I will get this off her.
Let everyone out.

01:16:00.374 --> 01:16:03.168
We're your friends.
Right now, we need your help.

01:16:03.502 --> 01:16:05.462
Let me get this off you.

01:18:46.624 --> 01:18:49.292
Why am I not surprised?

01:18:49.543 --> 01:18:51.711
You weren't too hard to find.

01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:54.797
Our satellite system is still operational.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:58.176
And there aren't too many people
flying nowadays.

01:18:58.176 --> 01:19:03.181
And besides, I always knew
you'd be drawn to your friends.

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:05.433
Loyalty,

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.019
highly overrated.

01:19:11.815 --> 01:19:13.316
Stop.

01:19:14.652 --> 01:19:16.402
Down.

01:19:17.696 --> 01:19:20.698
Wouldn't want you harming my pets.

01:19:23.285 --> 01:19:24.661
Drop your guns.

01:19:31.001 --> 01:19:33.544
Thank you.
Kick them to me.

01:19:36.256 --> 01:19:37.882
Good.

01:19:40.886 --> 01:19:43.012
You don't look so good, Bennett.

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:46.391
Yeah, I am looking forward
to playing with your pretty face.

01:19:46.391 --> 01:19:48.309
What do you want from me?

01:19:48.309 --> 01:19:51.729
The T-Virus brought me back.

01:19:56.276 --> 01:19:58.820
But it's so strong.

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.156
It fights me for control.

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:06.035
I thought if I ingested fresh human DNA,

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:08.204
I could redress the balance.

01:20:08.789 --> 01:20:11.541
No wonder your crew abandoned ship.

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.042
No matter.

01:20:13.419 --> 01:20:15.336
Now I have a new subordinate.

01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:18.006
And a new plan.

01:20:18.006 --> 01:20:22.260
You were the only one who
successfully bonded with the T-Virus.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.555
Your DNA is stronger than the others.

01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:27.890
I ingest you,

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:30.226
I gain control.

01:20:32.855 --> 01:20:34.939
That's pretty smart thinking.

01:20:35.399 --> 01:20:38.067
There's only one problem with that plan.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.403
Stop right there.

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:42.739
And what is that?

01:20:43.073 --> 01:20:45.324
I am not on the menu.

01:21:24.406 --> 01:21:28.284
Well, isn't this
one big family reunion?

01:21:28.577 --> 01:21:31.537
Chris and Claire Redfield.

01:21:31.537 --> 01:21:35.875
You have really become quite
an inconvenience for me.

01:21:37.169 --> 01:21:40.004
I told you
I'd be bringing a few friends.

01:21:44.384 --> 01:21:47.178
You should have brought more.

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:05.214
Claire. Claire.

01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:12.191
Chris.

01:23:58.268 --> 01:24:01.479
Don't even think about it.

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.488
Who the fuck are you?

01:25:01.915 --> 01:25:03.040
I don't think so.

01:25:25.272 --> 01:25:28.024
Don't-- Don't you shut them.
I am a producer.

01:25:30.277 --> 01:25:32.361
Open those doors.

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.239
You are going to deal with
some serious consequences.

01:25:35.239 --> 01:25:37.199
You mother-fuckers.

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:39.368
Open the--

01:25:43.123 --> 01:25:44.874
You're going to live to regret this,

01:25:44.874 --> 01:25:46.250
all of you.

01:25:53.383 --> 01:25:55.176
Oh, God.

01:25:56.178 --> 01:25:58.304
I just want to go home.

01:26:06.772 --> 01:26:07.938
Hey,

01:26:07.938 --> 01:26:10.024
it's going to be okay.

01:26:12.402 --> 01:26:13.611
No.

01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:15.404
Chris. Alice.

01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:36.675
Come on.

01:27:20.053 --> 01:27:22.263
I didn't want you to miss that.
Oh, heh, heh.

01:27:41.783 --> 01:27:43.617
That's right.

01:27:44.703 --> 01:27:46.996
Star power, bitches.

01:27:58.049 --> 01:28:00.009
It's a miracle.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.389
I never dreamed there would
be this many of us left alive.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.603
So, what's next?

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:17.818
This is Arcadia,
broadcasting on the emergency frequency--

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.615
I say...

01:28:23.408 --> 01:28:25.367
we live up to the promise.

01:28:26.369 --> 01:28:30.414
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

01:28:30.414 --> 01:28:36.045
Location 118.30 degrees west,
34.05 degrees north.

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:37.796
There is no infection.

01:28:37.796 --> 01:28:40.841
Repeat, there is no infection.

01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:45.596
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

01:28:45.596 --> 01:28:49.391
If you are out there,
we will help you.

01:28:49.643 --> 01:28:51.602
There is hope.

01:29:16.294 --> 01:29:19.004
What is that?
Trouble.

01:30:32.954 --> 01:30:35.581
Deployment in T-minus 57 seconds.

01:30:35.581 --> 01:30:38.542
When you hit the deck,
you watch your formation.

01:30:38.542 --> 01:30:40.836
Take no prisoners and shoot to kill.

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:43.088
Total enemy numbers are unknown

01:30:43.088 --> 01:30:46.592
but will include Umbrella fugitives
and prime targets.

01:30:46.592 --> 01:30:50.971
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield
and Project Alice.

01:30:51.389 --> 01:30:53.223
So, people,

01:30:53.223 --> 01:30:58.187
whatever's waiting for you out there,
just know one thing:

01:30:58.772 --> 01:31:02.608
You are going to be in for the fight

01:31:02.608 --> 01:31:05.069
of your lives.

01:36:44.909 --> 01:36:46.201
Hey, boys.

01:36:46.201 --> 01:36:49.371
Is that any way to treat a lady?
