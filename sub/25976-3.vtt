<i>Previously on</i> One Dollar...

00:10.641 --> 00:11.928
<i>It was a guy in a...</i>

00:11.995 --> 00:13.746
in a dark <i>hoodie, and...</i>

00:13.793 --> 00:15.114
<i>Where were you? Near the mill?</i>

00:15.139 --> 00:16.196
<i>No.</i>

00:16.248 --> 00:17.495
Where were you, then?

00:17.556 --> 00:18.836
<i>Look, you can probably imagine</i>

00:18.875 --> 00:19.929
<i>what case I'm working.</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:22.016
- What is this?
- You came to the ER the other night.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.101
I just wanted to drop by,

00:23.126 --> 00:24.428
<i>make sure you really hurt your head</i>

00:24.453 --> 00:26.390
<i>riding your four-wheeler
at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

00:26.530 --> 00:28.032
Walmart.

00:28.078 --> 00:29.382
You know who Travis Wilcox is?

00:29.407 --> 00:30.428
He came by,

00:30.453 --> 00:31.488
four different occasions,

00:31.513 --> 00:32.870
and bought shovels off me.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.546
That's the guy.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.903
Are you here about the
babysitting flyer?

00:38.976 --> 00:40.177
Come on in.

00:40.217 --> 00:42.196
I guess the most important question...

00:42.241 --> 00:44.563
are-are you free tomorrow night?

00:45.100 --> 00:46.808
<i>Do you have a schoolteacher discount?</i>

00:46.833 --> 00:48.003
I gotta make a profit,

00:48.028 --> 00:49.387
no matter how big my heart is.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.541
It's a terrible burden,

00:50.566 --> 00:51.604
having a heart that big.

00:51.638 --> 00:52.898
Seven.

Hey, there's Ms. Carol.

02:15.948 --> 02:17.789
Go get her. Go get her.

02:19.259 --> 02:22.082
Ms. Carol. Ms. Carol!

02:22.342 --> 02:24.955
Good morning, Markell. Come here.

02:26.661 --> 02:28.368
Ooh, what's this?

02:28.394 --> 02:29.735
- Oh, be careful.
- Whoa, whoa.

02:29.767 --> 02:30.967
- It's a globe.
- Markell.

02:30.992 --> 02:32.130
Markell.

02:32.638 --> 02:34.670
What did I tell you about asking first?

02:34.723 --> 02:36.205
Can I touch it, please?

02:36.238 --> 02:37.931
It's not for touching unless
our hands are clean.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.312
- They are.
- They are?

02:39.344 --> 02:40.779
I washed them after breakfast. Good.

02:40.813 --> 02:42.481
- I always do.
- Look.

02:42.515 --> 02:45.047
Listen to Ms. Carol, okay?
Be good today.

02:45.072 --> 02:47.168
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Dante.

02:47.827 --> 02:49.622
Can we paint today, Ms. Carol?

02:49.655 --> 02:51.798
Well, I was going to share
the globe with the class...

02:51.823 --> 02:52.958
If we're good? Please?

02:52.992 --> 02:54.777
I want to paint you another picture.

02:54.844 --> 02:56.923
Remember the tree I painted for you?

02:56.970 --> 02:59.699
I certainly do. It was
a beautiful tree.

02:59.927 --> 03:01.709
There's the warning bell,
though, so we better hurry.

03:01.733 --> 03:05.197
I'm excited for school today,
especially if we paint.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.539
We'll see.

03:06.572 --> 03:08.373
We'll see, which means <i>maybe.</i>

03:08.398 --> 03:09.708
- We'll see!
- We'll see, okay.

03:09.742 --> 03:11.444
And we are calming down.

03:11.476 --> 03:12.678
We are calming down.

03:12.703 --> 03:13.880
Yeah, well see!

03:29.462 --> 03:31.530
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:31.564 --> 03:33.565
- Want to...
- Yeah.

03:37.403 --> 03:39.071
Yeah, yeah.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.566
Yeah, I know how Pete works.

03:40.629 --> 03:42.675
He's gotta cross the routine stuff off

03:42.708 --> 03:44.737
one by fucking...

03:44.943 --> 03:46.344
- Excuse me.
- It's cool.

03:46.758 --> 03:48.815
The chief is very, very methodical.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.683
He don't make leaps, but sometimes,

03:50.717 --> 03:54.754
ironically, being too careful,
he misses opportunities.

03:54.952 --> 03:56.309
That was your conflict?

03:56.334 --> 03:57.923
Conflict?

03:57.957 --> 04:00.026
We didn't have a conflict.
We had arguments.

04:00.058 --> 04:01.617
Most days, we cleared the office.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.097
Folks ran like the
building was on fire.

04:04.130 --> 04:06.332
Hmm. So that's why you quit.

04:06.809 --> 04:09.557
Nah. I liked talking to him.

04:10.619 --> 04:11.904
What the hell?

04:11.938 --> 04:13.387
Huh, when did this happen?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.502
You haven't seen this?

04:14.527 --> 04:15.633
Kind of cool. It's just a pop-up.

04:15.658 --> 04:17.159
My mama used to get her
hair done here. Hmm.

04:17.510 --> 04:18.688
So, you got any leads?

04:18.713 --> 04:20.944
I mean, other than
Pete sat on his hands,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.416
hoping someone's blood lights
up on the FBI database.

04:24.447 --> 04:26.822
Mr. Noveer, it was nice
of you to call me.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.488
I appreciate your wanting
to, whatever, mentor me.

04:29.522 --> 04:30.690
I sure know what it's like being

04:30.722 --> 04:32.392
the one black cop in the department.

04:32.424 --> 04:34.794
But I can't tell you details
of the investigation.

04:35.146 --> 04:37.590
Cool. Let's take in some culture.

04:47.295 --> 04:49.121
So, come on, clues out of the bag.

04:49.327 --> 04:51.611
What was the one detail?

04:52.107 --> 04:54.026
Part of the shipment was
cancelled at the last minute.

04:54.059 --> 04:55.615
Mr. Carl said the specs were off.

04:56.414 --> 04:58.084
- Okay.
- Don't they check the specs

04:58.116 --> 04:59.289
way earlier than the last minute,

04:59.314 --> 05:00.969
like, before it's packed?

05:01.262 --> 05:03.056
Smart. You tell that to Trask?

05:04.455 --> 05:06.393
Didn't think it was my place.

05:09.628 --> 05:11.630
Hey, Toni.

05:13.621 --> 05:15.101
Look.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.803
A young black cop can't
wait, can't do the routine.

05:18.036 --> 05:19.336
You gotta show initiative.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.839
I can't search the mill by myself.

05:20.873 --> 05:22.967
No, but here's the bind you're in.

05:23.047 --> 05:25.549
If you just do the routine,
they'll say you're lazy.

05:25.777 --> 05:27.813
And if you grab your chances
and show initiative,

05:27.846 --> 05:29.649
you'll piss some of them off.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.883
But if you impress Pete, he's fair.

05:32.502 --> 05:33.719
He'll reward you.

05:33.753 --> 05:35.421
If that's true, why'd you quit?

05:36.956 --> 05:38.825
That wasn't really Pete's fault or mine.

05:39.071 --> 05:40.347
Whose was it?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.869
History's.

05:42.207 --> 05:44.710
Look, gotta go.

05:50.509 --> 05:52.148
Will this, uh, cover everything?

05:52.201 --> 05:54.140
- That'll do it.
- All right, well, night or day,

05:54.173 --> 05:55.806
you text me if you hear anything.

05:55.832 --> 05:57.709
Mr. Furlbee, I have the...

05:58.519 --> 05:59.960
Don't worry about me, young man.

06:00.006 --> 06:01.206
I'm just leaving.

06:03.025 --> 06:04.387
You play Monopoly as a kid?

06:04.412 --> 06:05.818
Oh. No, no,

06:05.851 --> 06:08.488
these are supposed to
be glued down, right?

06:08.907 --> 06:10.108
Uh...

06:10.782 --> 06:13.391
Now, see, the orange is all me.

06:13.424 --> 06:14.972
Mm.

06:14.997 --> 06:16.218
You got 'em surrounded.

06:16.411 --> 06:17.529
Yeah.

06:17.784 --> 06:20.682
I don't know which way this goes.

06:20.707 --> 06:22.052
This front or the back?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.276
Um, sorry.

06:23.310 --> 06:25.508
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Uh, no, no problem.

06:25.659 --> 06:27.344
- Is he a client, or...
- He's just someone I got some

06:27.369 --> 06:28.513
private, uh, business with.

06:28.538 --> 06:30.217
- That the bank paperwork?
- Yes.

06:30.522 --> 06:33.485
I'm sure you took a look at what
the loan extension is for?

06:33.567 --> 06:34.835
- All of this?
- Well,

06:34.860 --> 06:36.031
with everything that's
going on right now,

06:36.055 --> 06:37.143
we have to be a little aggressive.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.541
I mean, look at everything
that's not orange.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.300
<i>You ready to watch?</i>

06:46.325 --> 06:48.039
- Yes.
- You ready to listen?

06:48.088 --> 06:49.922
- Yes.
- You ready to think?

06:49.947 --> 06:51.916
Yes.

06:52.018 --> 06:53.307
What does this say?

06:53.359 --> 06:54.694
- Box.
- Box!

06:54.966 --> 06:57.784
"B" is for box. Who's got a "B"?

06:57.825 --> 06:59.246
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Do you have a box? Good.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.642
- Box? Box?
- Ooh, I do!

07:00.667 --> 07:02.449
- I-I have box.
- Box?

07:02.862 --> 07:04.976
Read, look at it carefully.

07:05.104 --> 07:06.189
See how that loops?

07:06.214 --> 07:08.329
The E doesn't loop like that. Okay?

07:08.396 --> 07:09.863
Next.

07:10.577 --> 07:12.745
"K." What is it for?

07:12.872 --> 07:14.674
- For karate...
- Karate!

07:14.815 --> 07:17.639
I don't do karate. I do kung fu!

07:17.664 --> 07:19.300
You can do kung fu

07:19.325 --> 07:20.907
at recess, okay?

07:20.987 --> 07:23.290
For now, we're gonna sit down.

07:23.517 --> 07:25.085
Markell, I like it when you sit.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.828
- I like it when you sit.
- If we do a good job,

07:26.853 --> 07:28.149
can we have extra recess?

07:28.174 --> 07:30.396
You're doing a good job, and so, yes,

07:30.421 --> 07:31.704
we can have extra recess.

07:31.729 --> 07:33.698
I don't want extra recess.

07:33.894 --> 07:35.695
I wanna paint.

07:36.108 --> 07:38.462
Who else has got "K" for Kara...

07:38.487 --> 07:41.068
Markell, I like it when you sit down.

07:41.314 --> 07:44.162
Markell, what did I say about
touching the supplies?

07:44.839 --> 07:46.135
Look, Ms. Carol,

07:46.160 --> 07:47.789
- I'm putting it back.
- Good.

07:47.814 --> 07:49.882
Does that mean we can paint later?

07:49.907 --> 07:51.260
If I live that long.

07:51.285 --> 07:52.845
Come here. Come here.

07:52.899 --> 07:55.235
Take my hand, take my
hand, take my hand.

07:55.502 --> 07:56.904
Take my hand.

07:57.524 --> 08:01.036
Sit down, okay? Sit down quietly.

08:01.107 --> 08:03.576
Gently? Okay, good, go.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.294
Markell, what did we say?

08:05.364 --> 08:06.933
Quietly and gently.

08:07.452 --> 08:09.716
Sit! Very good.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.752
Now I'm happy.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.579
"Y" is for...

08:14.604 --> 08:16.507
- Yoga.
- Yoga!

08:16.567 --> 08:18.348
So, Toni, what did you find out?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.729
- Who the hell is Travis Wilcox?
- Age 38.

08:20.754 --> 08:23.075
Lives alone, owns a used
car lot on Highway 42.

08:23.155 --> 08:25.390
Are you talking about the guy
that Walmart was talking about?

08:25.415 --> 08:27.057
The one who bought all the shovels?

08:27.082 --> 08:29.117
Yeah, that's right, I talked
to a salesman at his car lot.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.011
He said Travis hasn't called in
or shown up since Seven Bloods.

08:32.292 --> 08:34.634
Huh. Has anybody else, uh,
reported him missing?

08:34.659 --> 08:37.332
- No.
- Aw, he's not missing, Chief.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.826
He's just exhausted from
digging a seven-person grave.

08:41.553 --> 08:43.717
Wilcox is a member of
American Forefront.

08:43.743 --> 08:44.928
They're a white supremacist group.

08:44.952 --> 08:46.922
Ah, okay, so that's
why you give a shit.

08:46.947 --> 08:48.648
- That's not why...
- Oh, don't...

08:48.673 --> 08:50.620
Don't get yourself all like,.

08:50.645 --> 08:52.030
You're right, they're nutjobs.

08:52.842 --> 08:54.429
I know him, Chief.

08:54.518 --> 08:56.684
He is a nut. Came in a year ago,

08:56.725 --> 08:57.752
saying there were Mexicans living

08:57.777 --> 08:58.969
in the woods behind his house.

08:59.025 --> 09:00.080
And if we didn't take care of them,

09:00.104 --> 09:01.013
he was gonna go "hunting wetbacks."

09:01.078 --> 09:03.130
- Hmm.
- I checked gun stores in Braden

09:03.155 --> 09:05.867
and Riverside, he's bought 22
different assault weapons.

09:05.910 --> 09:08.344
Seven .45's, four tactical shotguns...

09:08.424 --> 09:09.605
Here's the full printout, Chief.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.259
Come to think of
it, he had this crazy theory

09:11.283 --> 09:13.017
that Carl Steel was using illegals

09:13.050 --> 09:15.085
to work secret shifts at night.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.857
You know, taking jobs
away from Americans.

09:16.882 --> 09:19.814
If the Seven Bloods victims
were undocumented, sir...

09:19.927 --> 09:22.113
well, no one would report them missing,

09:22.138 --> 09:24.799
and they wouldn't show up
on the FBI's DNA database.

09:26.364 --> 09:28.999
Okay. So you're not totally worthless.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.675
Good work.

09:32.894 --> 09:34.386
Let's go check this out.

09:38.669 --> 09:41.029
You're not actually gonna go, are you?

09:41.338 --> 09:43.202
I don't know, I figured I
could learn more about him

09:43.227 --> 09:45.030
by working for him.

09:45.183 --> 09:47.953
Yeah, that's a really great idea.

09:47.986 --> 09:50.276
Go work for the guy who
might've killed seven peeps,

09:50.301 --> 09:53.575
and if he kills you, then
hey, you'll know he's a killer.

09:53.952 --> 09:56.154
How did he not recognize you?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.205
I don't know. I figured he would.

09:59.884 --> 10:02.175
But it was dark, and it
all happened so fast.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.155
You've never babysat before.

10:04.268 --> 10:06.136
Yeah, how hard can it be?

10:08.427 --> 10:10.463
You think he's cute.

10:11.350 --> 10:13.317
That's what this is about.

10:18.397 --> 10:19.718
Hello?

10:21.005 --> 10:23.008
Yeah, yeah...

10:30.926 --> 10:32.728
Okay. Yeah.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.386
Uh, I'll see you then.

10:38.807 --> 10:40.472
You look totally freaked out.

10:40.546 --> 10:42.073
Who was that?

10:42.756 --> 10:46.343
Uh, you know the private
investigator from yesterday?

10:47.110 --> 10:49.113
That was him.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.073
The research is pretty clear, though.

11:01.132 --> 11:02.933
Some physical activity
throughout the day...

11:02.958 --> 11:05.161
But it gets complicated
in overpopulated schools.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.455
Well, sure, but we
don't have that problem here.

11:07.936 --> 11:09.667
You okay, Carol?

11:10.261 --> 11:13.564
Mm, absolutely. I'm
just a little tired.

11:13.704 --> 11:15.506
Out dancing too many nights in a row?

11:15.620 --> 11:17.220
That's it.

11:17.775 --> 11:19.711
Well, we could sit. You want to sit?

11:19.743 --> 11:21.470
All this talk about
physical activity...

11:21.495 --> 11:22.519
You girls keep talking.

11:22.544 --> 11:24.845
I think I'll step outside
and clear my head.

11:24.882 --> 11:26.149
You really okay, Carol?

11:26.181 --> 11:27.364
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:27.785 --> 11:29.054
How's your class?

11:29.440 --> 11:31.337
Fine. They're fine.

11:31.362 --> 11:33.899
That... I've got a little
boy who may have

11:33.924 --> 11:37.197
the worst case of ADHD
I've ever seen, but...

11:37.397 --> 11:39.106
20 years from now,
he'll invent something

11:39.131 --> 11:41.034
that changes the way life is lived.

11:42.437 --> 11:44.703
Yeah. Of course. You're right.

11:44.953 --> 11:46.737
Doesn't make it easy, though.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.767
Do you remember what you
told me last September?

11:48.801 --> 11:49.861
What was that?

11:49.886 --> 11:51.660
Well, when I had those twins,

11:51.770 --> 11:55.040
you said, step one: be exasperated.

11:55.287 --> 11:57.689
Step two: get over it.

12:00.578 --> 12:02.260
I better hurry.

12:10.433 --> 12:11.866
Hey...

12:12.676 --> 12:14.310
Are we meeting?

12:14.425 --> 12:16.558
- Uh, I don't...
- No, no.

12:16.628 --> 12:18.952
No, this is... way too public.

12:18.977 --> 12:21.213
But actually, do you
have about ten minutes?

12:21.238 --> 12:23.040
- Because I...
- I kind of got a...

12:23.065 --> 12:25.867
Right. Yeah, no. This is too risky.

12:25.924 --> 12:27.892
I'm gonna call you. Diner?

12:28.441 --> 12:29.694
- Sounds good.
- Great.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.138
All right.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.098
Ah.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.113
Sorry to keep you waiting.

12:42.459 --> 12:45.270
- No worries.
- I appreciate you taking the time.

12:46.317 --> 12:48.285
I used to be a cop.

12:48.447 --> 12:51.016
We always like to talk face-to-face.

12:51.108 --> 12:52.972
I wanted to talk cause...

12:53.971 --> 12:56.307
after I saw you at Mr.
Bennett's last night,

12:57.219 --> 13:00.222
I found out he hasn't used
his four-wheeler in weeks.

13:00.945 --> 13:02.714
Ty told you that?

13:03.475 --> 13:05.505
So I got to thinking...

13:06.050 --> 13:07.918
if he wasn't telling the truth,

13:08.424 --> 13:10.059
maybe you weren't either.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.411
No chance you and Ty were
together when he got banged up?

13:15.007 --> 13:18.672
What? While we were in the
middle of killing seven people?

13:18.697 --> 13:20.433
No, huh?

13:20.698 --> 13:23.538
Would've started small. Three at most.

13:23.588 --> 13:26.024
Smart. Cause less of a scene that way.

13:26.049 --> 13:27.516
Yeah, you get it.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.878
Well, even if you weren't
killing seven people...

13:30.127 --> 13:31.528
why were you at Ty's?

13:32.121 --> 13:34.124
We're friends.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.318
That through your dad?

13:37.314 --> 13:39.140
You sure you weren't
together when he got hurt?

13:39.203 --> 13:41.571
- Friend of mine at the emergency...
- Okay. Yeah.

13:43.695 --> 13:44.963
We were together.

13:44.988 --> 13:47.226
And I'm sorry we lied
about it, but it...

13:47.298 --> 13:48.753
You know.

13:49.513 --> 13:50.834
He works for my dad.

13:50.928 --> 13:52.563
And he got hurt how?

13:55.879 --> 13:57.685
We had a miscommunication.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.040
Sometimes known as a fistfight.

13:59.065 --> 14:00.406
I saw Mr. Bennett's face

14:00.431 --> 14:01.780
and I'm looking at your knuckles.

14:01.872 --> 14:03.875
They didn't give him that shiner.

14:08.026 --> 14:12.099
We watched a movie and then, um...

14:14.197 --> 14:16.355
We snuck into the country club.

14:16.882 --> 14:18.583
After hours.

14:18.957 --> 14:20.437
Go on.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.362
It got romantic.

14:24.846 --> 14:27.299
But there were missed
signals and he thought that,

14:27.326 --> 14:30.434
I wanted something that I... didn't.

14:30.752 --> 14:32.551
And I, I...

14:32.791 --> 14:34.492
I-I sort of tripped him.

14:34.684 --> 14:36.188
Accidentally, I didn't mean to,

14:36.213 --> 14:38.174
but he still hit his face on the table.

14:38.316 --> 14:39.717
Ouch.

14:39.756 --> 14:40.916
Yeah, you saw it.

14:40.941 --> 14:43.347
Hmm. I meant the missed signals.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.846
We realized it was just
one big misunderstanding.

14:47.198 --> 14:49.434
And you guys wouldn't
tell me this because...?

14:49.861 --> 14:53.190
Because you're a stranger
that showed up at our door.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.561
Yeah.

14:56.586 --> 14:57.896
All right, that's a fair point.

14:59.136 --> 15:00.338
But look...

15:00.665 --> 15:03.008
- Miss Furlbee?
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.668 --> 15:06.058
You ever feel threatened
on a date again,

15:06.518 --> 15:08.159
you give me a call, okay?

15:29.894 --> 15:31.862
Where's the blue?

15:32.247 --> 15:34.047
If you have a question, Markell,

15:34.072 --> 15:36.902
please come and ask me quietly, okay?

15:40.392 --> 15:42.092
I don't have any blue.

15:42.306 --> 15:44.815
We have to share the
colors we're short on.

15:44.955 --> 15:46.022
Hey.

15:46.047 --> 15:48.648
Jenna has blue, maybe you
can use it when she's done.

15:48.673 --> 15:51.009
Go ask her nicely and say "please."

15:51.074 --> 15:52.276
- Okay.
- Okay?

15:54.052 --> 15:55.293
I need the blue.

15:55.346 --> 15:56.514
When I'm done.

16:07.036 --> 16:08.371
I need it! I'll give it back.

16:08.423 --> 16:09.817
Markell.

16:09.842 --> 16:10.915
No! Wait your turn.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.211
Markell? Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Let go.

16:13.236 --> 16:14.319
- Markell.
- I'll give it back!

16:14.343 --> 16:15.671
- Let go, let go.
- I'll give it back.

16:15.696 --> 16:17.593
Just let it go...

16:17.853 --> 16:20.011
Markell!

16:21.372 --> 16:23.020
I'm sorry.

16:23.146 --> 16:24.784
I'm sorry, honey.

16:27.731 --> 16:29.520
Oh...

16:29.894 --> 16:31.895
I'm sorry.

17:34.989 --> 17:36.559
Hey, can I ask you something?

17:36.584 --> 17:37.590
Uh-oh.

17:37.615 --> 17:38.774
Whenever a woman asks

17:38.799 --> 17:40.667
if she can ask you something, look out.

17:41.058 --> 17:42.756
I'm kidding, go ahead.

17:42.907 --> 17:45.294
What really happened between
Jake Noveer and the chief?

17:45.579 --> 17:46.978
Oh, that. Well...

17:47.486 --> 17:48.967
Jake was kind of his guy.

17:49.054 --> 17:50.412
To be honest, they were
more like best b...

17:50.436 --> 17:53.107
You know Jake got promoted to detective

17:53.132 --> 17:54.773
after only two years on the job?

17:54.844 --> 17:56.173
- Two years?
- Yeah, and he joined

17:56.198 --> 17:57.306
five years after me.

17:57.615 --> 17:58.946
Now, not for nothing,

17:59.009 --> 18:02.141
but this whole affirmative
stuff, not to insult ya...

18:02.540 --> 18:04.941
It ain't always really
fair to the rest of us.

18:11.408 --> 18:12.997
So what happened?

18:13.110 --> 18:15.498
Well, about a year
ago, there was a case.

18:15.598 --> 18:18.695
Little girl went missing.
She happened to be black.

18:18.841 --> 18:22.136
We busted our asses,
five months, nothing.

18:22.190 --> 18:24.353
But that wasn't good enough for Mr.
Noveer.

18:24.508 --> 18:26.311
So he played the card.

18:27.575 --> 18:29.081
The card.

18:29.506 --> 18:30.942
How did he play the card?

18:31.074 --> 18:32.297
What do you mean, how?

18:32.322 --> 18:34.454
He called the chief a
racist fuck and he quit.

18:49.779 --> 18:52.115
Lets cross this dead end off the list.

19:01.171 --> 19:02.221
Whoa. Hold up.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.346
- Get that bitch off my lawn!
- Gun!

19:07.384 --> 19:08.885
- Take cover.
- Down!

19:09.246 --> 19:11.015
Requesting backup, 904 Birch Drive.

19:11.354 --> 19:13.024
- Suspect is armed...
- Braden Police!

19:13.096 --> 19:15.133
- Put your weapon down on the ground!
- It's the Braden Police!

19:15.157 --> 19:16.817
Come out of the house with
your hands on your head!

19:16.877 --> 19:18.818
Confirm that your weapon is down!

19:18.869 --> 19:20.373
Shoot, where'd they go?

19:20.444 --> 19:21.713
I think we're clear.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.237
I think they're on the move.
Go, go, go.

19:30.374 --> 19:31.701
- Door?
- It's open.

19:31.736 --> 19:33.070
We're going in.

19:33.103 --> 19:34.937
Uh, Rook, you take the right
side to the backyard,

19:34.984 --> 19:36.705
Martin, you stay here in case
they get past us. You got it?

19:36.729 --> 19:37.786
Yep.

19:37.820 --> 19:38.987
Go.

19:44.672 --> 19:46.342
Braden Police!

19:46.401 --> 19:47.837
We're coming in!

19:54.016 --> 19:55.937
Travis, this is Chief Trask.

19:56.145 --> 19:57.880
We just need to talk to you.

19:58.252 --> 20:00.889
Travis, we just need to talk to you.

20:02.978 --> 20:04.479
Put your gun down,

20:04.514 --> 20:05.915
tell us where you are.

20:22.799 --> 20:23.899
Dens clear.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.901
Nobody.

20:29.472 --> 20:30.739
Kitchens clear.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.774
Nobody came out front.

20:34.037 --> 20:35.844
The, uh... the backyards clear?

20:37.679 --> 20:39.082
Shit, I came in a side door.

20:48.858 --> 20:50.560
Oh, shit.

20:50.592 --> 20:52.527
Wilcox and an unidentified female.

20:52.562 --> 20:53.971
They're on foot heading
east through the woods.

20:53.995 --> 20:55.965
Repeat, on foot, heading
east through the woods.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.132
Fuck.

21:01.937 --> 21:03.872
Backyard is in the back.

21:03.906 --> 21:04.956
Get it?

21:05.603 --> 21:07.110
I'm sorry.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.454
Barn.

21:08.563 --> 21:10.296
I'm sorry, Chief.

21:11.423 --> 21:13.448
Listen to me next time.

21:15.016 --> 21:16.852
Affirmative fucking action.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.380
Hi, hon.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.739
How was your day?

21:38.602 --> 21:39.675
Okay.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.587
- Yours?
- Exhausting.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.245
Mine, anyway.

21:43.286 --> 21:45.354
This one had the day off, went fishing.

21:45.379 --> 21:46.995
Oh, you must've needed it.

21:47.020 --> 21:48.561
How's the investigation going?

21:48.586 --> 21:50.593
I heard they were taking
a look at some nutjob.

21:50.986 --> 21:52.889
Probably come up empty by now,
you know what I mean?

21:52.921 --> 21:54.420
Yeah.

21:55.552 --> 21:57.759
Little boys room calling,
you ladies don't mind.

22:07.349 --> 22:09.484
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

22:10.556 --> 22:12.687
Chardonnay time? Mm...

22:13.541 --> 22:16.278
Really, Janet, I'm just, um, I'm tired.

22:16.312 --> 22:17.713
I'm just...

22:22.585 --> 22:23.752
What?

22:24.385 --> 22:25.863
I'm okay.

22:34.268 --> 22:35.384
Dannie?

22:35.409 --> 22:36.501
Yeah?

22:36.598 --> 22:38.032
Are you going out again?

22:38.095 --> 22:40.553
Don't go all Mom on me, Dad.

22:41.102 --> 22:42.604
Are you in tonight?

22:42.638 --> 22:44.040
I had a plan, but no.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.242
Definitely in tonight.

22:46.689 --> 22:49.911
Then you guys should watch
a movie or something.

22:50.075 --> 22:52.336
You'll be empty nesters soon.

22:53.333 --> 22:56.284
Guess it's time to rekindle
the romance, right?

22:58.353 --> 22:59.803
Okay.

23:10.814 --> 23:12.077
<i>Yeah, so there's bacon and eggs</i>

23:12.101 --> 23:13.369
you can cook up for dinner.

23:13.394 --> 23:16.793
Uh... she had, like, a late lunch,

23:16.818 --> 23:18.854
so, uh, just wait a while.

23:18.932 --> 23:20.602
Her juice is in the fridge.

23:20.842 --> 23:23.022
She's gonna want to use,
like, a regular glass,

23:23.047 --> 23:24.648
but make her use a sippy cup.

23:24.673 --> 23:25.840
It's in the drainboard.

23:25.865 --> 23:27.065
Oh, sippy cup. Yeah, got it.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.636
Yeah, uh, bed by 8:30.

23:28.684 --> 23:31.115
Uh, if... I've been, like,

23:31.146 --> 23:33.248
trying to potty train her, but, uh,

23:33.322 --> 23:35.730
she's still, like, wearing
diapers at night.

23:35.755 --> 23:37.592
The-the package is in her room.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.160
Sorry, wh-where is it?

23:39.195 --> 23:40.447
- Uh, in her room.
- Oh.

23:40.472 --> 23:41.606
- Got it.
- Yeah. Oh,

23:41.631 --> 23:43.578
and I-I forgot we ran out of wipes,

23:43.765 --> 23:46.663
but there's like a-a
stack, uh, of washcloths

23:46.688 --> 23:48.184
with, like, little mice on them.

23:48.236 --> 23:50.273
You can just use them for whatever.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.890
- Okay.
- Uh...

23:51.915 --> 23:53.815
has to have her quilt to sleep.

23:53.855 --> 23:55.311
- That one?
- That one.

23:55.343 --> 23:56.488
Oh, this one.

23:56.513 --> 23:57.717
Oh, and of-of course,

23:57.742 --> 23:59.074
you got to brush her teeth for her.

23:59.099 --> 24:02.373
Um, yeah, just-just, like,
have her lie on the floor.

24:02.713 --> 24:04.687
Hey, bye-bye.

24:04.846 --> 24:06.349
- Bye, bye, bye...
- Bye.

24:06.443 --> 24:07.857
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.

24:08.425 --> 24:10.359
- Bye.
- Yeah, um...

24:10.710 --> 24:12.962
Okay, uh...

24:13.177 --> 24:14.680
So I-I'll see you guys later.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.014
Yeah, see you soon.

24:18.384 --> 24:19.834
Did you knock them over?

24:19.869 --> 24:21.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

24:22.949 --> 24:25.174
You're a great teacher.

24:25.784 --> 24:27.877
Everybody has a bad day now and then.

24:28.150 --> 24:29.948
You were provoked.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.158
I hit him.

24:33.289 --> 24:35.858
I hit a child with learning issues.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.882
Of all my kids this summer,

24:37.907 --> 24:40.577
Markell is the one who most
needs me to be patient.

24:40.689 --> 24:41.830
Markell?

24:41.890 --> 24:43.059
Is he African-American?

24:43.091 --> 24:44.239
Yeah.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.787
Just placing the name.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.772
Look, I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.081
And you are just plain tired, hon.

24:51.127 --> 24:53.076
Usually, you'd have a
break, but this summer...

24:53.101 --> 24:55.371
- You needed the OT.
- That's true.

24:55.684 --> 24:57.164
Kids dad work in the mill?

24:57.273 --> 24:59.241
Yeah, he does.

24:59.341 --> 25:01.322
Maybe all the stress in
that is trickling down.

25:01.397 --> 25:02.501
Notice how he doesn't ask

25:02.526 --> 25:03.987
if the kids mom works down at the mill?

25:04.012 --> 25:05.741
Your daughter'd give you hell for that.

25:05.766 --> 25:07.535
No, there's nothing wrong with Markell.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.128
He's just hyperactive.

25:09.857 --> 25:12.391
- I lost it.
- Any dinner on the horizon?

25:13.057 --> 25:15.022
I could be lying in a pool of blood,

25:15.047 --> 25:16.792
and he'd want to know what's for dinner.

25:16.825 --> 25:18.029
Pool of blood.

25:18.054 --> 25:19.221
Thanks a lot.

25:21.162 --> 25:22.430
Stop skulking.

25:23.038 --> 25:25.240
Whatever you say, Chief.

25:27.794 --> 25:30.206
Janet, this boy is so sweet.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.207
He truly loves me.

25:32.706 --> 25:35.234
He brought me this plastic truck.

25:35.312 --> 25:38.814
He said it was his favorite toy,
but he wanted me to have it.

25:42.159 --> 25:43.225
What?

25:43.356 --> 25:44.865
When I was starting out,

25:44.890 --> 25:47.312
there was this monster, Mrs.
Blankenship,

25:47.337 --> 25:49.058
who spanked her kids regularly.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.687
And I remember, I went to the
principal two or three times

25:51.712 --> 25:53.148
saying she should be fired.

25:53.541 --> 25:55.997
Carol, there's no comparison.

25:56.436 --> 25:58.111
We all have bad days.

25:58.145 --> 26:00.678
If I had a bad day, imagine
what it was like for him.

26:02.108 --> 26:03.721
Carol, stop.

26:04.726 --> 26:06.294
Honey, really.

26:07.589 --> 26:09.288
You're a good friend.

26:10.129 --> 26:11.654
Go. Eat with your husband.

26:11.679 --> 26:15.082
I-I-I think I just
have to sit with this.

26:23.111 --> 26:24.400
<i>I called in State.</i>

26:24.425 --> 26:25.757
We threw a huge net around the woods.

26:25.782 --> 26:27.737
A fucking mosquito couldn't get through.

26:28.111 --> 26:29.186
Yeah.

26:29.211 --> 26:30.713
Well, how about, uh, stolen cars?

26:30.747 --> 26:32.294
Any reports?

26:32.902 --> 26:35.203
All right. Thanks.

26:35.924 --> 26:39.174
Let's, uh, do a dummy check,
see if we missed anything.

27:13.722 --> 27:16.759
I already looked in there, girly.

28:12.282 --> 28:14.383
- What?
- Shh.

28:37.599 --> 28:39.652
Wilcox, you are surrounded!

28:39.799 --> 28:42.485
Open the door slowly,
throw out your weapons.

28:44.062 --> 28:45.196
Breach.

28:53.123 --> 28:54.457
Tunnel.

28:57.555 --> 28:59.123
Clear.

29:12.704 --> 29:14.339
Tunnels clear.

29:14.741 --> 29:17.483
Holy shit, a fucking tunnel.

29:18.662 --> 29:20.731
We got to see where this thing goes.

29:24.334 --> 29:25.703
What?

29:53.531 --> 29:55.211
Uh...

29:56.081 --> 29:57.616
I oil the pan, right?

29:57.641 --> 29:59.011
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:59.484 --> 30:01.148
Thank you.

30:03.358 --> 30:04.536
Uh...

30:11.216 --> 30:12.457
Oops.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.445
Got that.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.000
Oh.

30:22.077 --> 30:23.992
You're testing me.

30:24.933 --> 30:26.635
What about some, um, bread?

30:26.660 --> 30:28.380
Where's, uh, where's Daddy
keep the bread, Carrie?

30:29.808 --> 30:31.276
What?

30:31.362 --> 30:32.464
What is it, honey?

30:34.977 --> 30:37.523
Oh, oh, oh, what is it, baby?

30:37.550 --> 30:39.951
Oh, honey. Oh, gosh.

30:39.986 --> 30:41.924
Oh, what is it?

30:42.007 --> 30:44.476
Oh. Oh, honey, did you wet your pants?

30:44.623 --> 30:46.425
Shh. That's okay, baby, come on.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.220
Let's-lets get you in
some dry ones, okay?

30:48.261 --> 30:49.500
It's okay.

30:49.601 --> 30:51.504
Let's do that.

30:57.211 --> 30:58.605
Let's clean you up.

30:58.675 --> 30:59.877
It's okay.

31:00.346 --> 31:02.166
What is wrong with me?

31:09.842 --> 31:11.209
Fuck!

31:48.466 --> 31:50.467
Oh, man.

31:51.916 --> 31:53.504
Oh, shit.

34:29.688 --> 34:31.005
Hey, see you, man.

34:31.081 --> 34:32.398
Oh, see you, man.

35:19.069 --> 35:20.404
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:20.483 --> 35:22.342
Uh... how was work?

35:22.367 --> 35:23.925
It was work.

35:24.008 --> 35:25.142
Yeah.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.627
What happened?

35:32.033 --> 35:33.439
Everything's totally fine.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.367
Carrie went to bed, no problem.

35:35.392 --> 35:38.650
She did have a little bit of an
accident before dinner, but...

35:39.036 --> 35:41.572
got her changed, put her
down, and Everything's fine.

35:41.664 --> 35:43.165
Now.

35:47.784 --> 35:49.653
What happened?

35:51.037 --> 35:52.098
I'm really sorry,

35:52.123 --> 35:54.205
and I-I do take full
responsibility for this,

35:54.230 --> 35:55.951
but I-I was making dinner...

35:55.976 --> 35:57.057
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and I stepped away

35:57.082 --> 35:58.276
for a split second and-and...

35:58.301 --> 35:59.529
And there was a fire?

35:59.676 --> 36:01.306
Mm-hmm.

36:01.339 --> 36:03.128
It was a very, very small one

36:03.153 --> 36:04.517
and Carrie was never in any danger.

36:04.542 --> 36:06.322
It was over in less than a minute,

36:06.347 --> 36:08.930
and-and-and a couple of your
dish towels got burned,

36:08.955 --> 36:10.301
which I'm really, really sorry about.

36:10.341 --> 36:12.258
- But I-I tried to clean up the wall...
- Okay. All right.

36:12.283 --> 36:14.379
...which is absolutely
no problem and...

36:14.404 --> 36:17.107
- Fuck!
- ...she's in there asleep now.

36:21.735 --> 36:23.590
Uh, yeah, I can't be at the mill,

36:23.615 --> 36:26.765
um, wondering if-if she's in danger.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.872
Uh-huh.

36:30.511 --> 36:33.606
I put her to sleep, and she's fine.

36:33.872 --> 36:36.375
Fuck, I have OT again tomorrow night.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.844
I understand if you're
too upset at me, but...

36:40.812 --> 36:42.676
I can be here tomorrow.

36:46.388 --> 36:48.050
I made a really stupid mistake.

36:48.103 --> 36:49.632
Uh-huh.

36:50.565 --> 36:52.195
And I poured water on
a grease fire, and...

36:52.220 --> 36:53.625
Yeah, grease fire. No.

36:54.488 --> 36:56.110
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

36:56.135 --> 36:58.121
- You beat it out with the...
- That's right.

36:58.235 --> 37:00.385
Yeah, well, it's great.
You cleaned it up great.

37:00.410 --> 37:02.540
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry about your wall.

37:02.607 --> 37:04.715
Could I buy some paint
and-and paint over it?

37:04.975 --> 37:06.237
Um...

37:07.012 --> 37:08.615
I can even paint the whole
kitchen if you want

37:08.640 --> 37:10.691
so it'll-it'll all m-match.

37:14.571 --> 37:15.973
You're 18?

37:16.828 --> 37:20.204
A-As of, um, as of last week.

37:20.464 --> 37:22.161
Okay.

37:24.829 --> 37:26.566
Okay.

37:27.431 --> 37:29.606
O-Obviously, I don't, I don't
want to be paid for tonight.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.773
Yeah, no.

37:30.978 --> 37:32.698
Uh, yeah, and, um...

37:33.204 --> 37:35.452
I totally get it I-if
you don't want me here.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.039
I probably wouldn't want
me here, either, but, um,

37:38.105 --> 37:40.873
um, if you're in a bind,
I-I can be here.

37:41.835 --> 37:43.329
You said you had OT tomorrow...

37:43.354 --> 37:45.655
Wow. Okay.

37:48.029 --> 37:49.595
Oh, fuck.

37:49.982 --> 37:53.328
When I was 17, if I had
been in your situation...

37:53.568 --> 37:56.062
first of all, no one would
have left the kid with me...

37:56.822 --> 37:58.632
but, uh, if I had started a fire,

37:58.657 --> 38:00.923
the whole fucking house
would've burned down.

38:01.030 --> 38:02.760
I would've been fucking wasted.

38:03.313 --> 38:05.499
Did you have a drinking
problem when you were my age?

38:05.524 --> 38:08.893
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, I
had a drinking problem.

38:12.182 --> 38:14.640
Hey, uh, second chances, all right?

38:16.947 --> 38:19.005
Yeah, uh, why don't you
just, like, come back, uh,

38:19.030 --> 38:20.502
tomorrow night and we'll-we'll just,

38:20.527 --> 38:22.023
we'll start over.

38:43.740 --> 38:45.255
What the hell are you doing up?

38:45.280 --> 38:47.573
This is like noon for me.

38:47.897 --> 38:49.341
What the hell are you doing up?

38:49.664 --> 38:51.298
You're not still looking
for the Nazi, are you?

38:51.323 --> 38:53.873
Yeah, I'm beat. You went here?

38:54.307 --> 38:55.974
- Uh-huh.
- Same.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.333
Pretty good school for me.

38:57.479 --> 38:58.799
Yeah, happy times.

38:58.866 --> 39:00.421
Who was your favorite teacher?

39:00.628 --> 39:02.172
Well, that's easy, Ms. Carol.

39:02.238 --> 39:03.489
Ms. Carol.

39:03.522 --> 39:05.881
Me, too, but she got married.
We called her Mrs. Carol.

39:05.906 --> 39:07.120
But Carol was her first name,

39:07.145 --> 39:09.352
- so... it never made sense.
- I know.

39:11.889 --> 39:14.245
You know, the chief seems to
want me to partner with Chewy

39:14.270 --> 39:15.445
as much as possible.

39:15.470 --> 39:16.637
Means he likes you.

39:16.758 --> 39:18.018
Why?

39:18.066 --> 39:20.457
Chewy'll have your back.
Keep you alive.

39:20.489 --> 39:22.326
Chewy isn't a big fan of black people.

39:22.351 --> 39:23.680
True, but it's also true

39:23.705 --> 39:25.187
that Chewy's just an all-around asshole

39:25.212 --> 39:27.140
- who likes to needle rookies.
- Not only that,

39:27.165 --> 39:28.750
he's got problems working with a woman.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.287
Yet and still he's got to protect you.

39:32.173 --> 39:34.557
Chewy said you and Trask were friends.

39:35.266 --> 39:36.776
Yep. True and good friends.

39:36.801 --> 39:39.438
Until you had a fight
about the missing girl.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.663
Abby Washington. That's right.

39:41.749 --> 39:43.991
Did you really call the
Chief a racist fuck?

39:44.079 --> 39:46.498
Peter told me to drop the case and I...

39:47.124 --> 39:49.993
Well, nothing stings a white man
like being called a racist.

39:50.339 --> 39:51.954
Chief's the one who treats me the best.

39:51.979 --> 39:53.814
Seems like he really
wants me to do well.

39:53.839 --> 39:55.460
Yeah, I'm sure he really does.

39:55.485 --> 39:57.237
He's no Chewy; he knows better.

39:57.340 --> 40:00.142
But he still gives Bud Carl
the benefit of the doubt.

40:00.455 --> 40:02.347
And a missing black girl...

40:02.427 --> 40:03.971
well, I worry that doesn't bother Peter

40:03.996 --> 40:06.087
quite as much as a missing white girl.

40:07.663 --> 40:09.665
I hear that.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.054
I'll see you.

40:13.169 --> 40:14.564
All right.

40:18.602 --> 40:20.301
But you can't quit.

40:20.414 --> 40:21.887
We've got two more weeks.

40:21.912 --> 40:23.081
I have to.

40:23.318 --> 40:25.521
You reported the incident immediately

40:25.740 --> 40:28.677
and I spoke at length with
Markell and his father.

40:29.412 --> 40:32.160
You can't quit because you got angry.

40:32.329 --> 40:33.936
- If every teacher quit because...
- I hit him.

40:33.961 --> 40:35.520
I spanked him. I-I mean,

40:35.545 --> 40:36.810
I've never hit a kid before.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.238
You lost your patience.

40:39.595 --> 40:40.784
It happens to all of us.

40:40.809 --> 40:43.055
You think I don't know what
losing my patience feels like?

40:43.086 --> 40:45.988
38 years, I've never come
close to hitting a kid.

40:46.122 --> 40:48.992
And that is why I cannot
accept your resignation.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.118
Why do you see this one
misstep as so final?

40:57.993 --> 40:59.994
Because I...

41:03.516 --> 41:05.814
I don't know.

41:06.286 --> 41:09.887
Because what I did is
beyond the pale and...

41:10.833 --> 41:13.284
- that's it.
- Hmm.

41:14.463 --> 41:16.025
Carol, I didn't want to bring this up,

41:16.050 --> 41:17.431
but Nikki saw the incident.

41:17.456 --> 41:18.657
Oh, I know.

41:18.682 --> 41:20.406
And she wondered...

41:21.104 --> 41:24.039
- She thought maybe...
- What?

41:24.665 --> 41:27.451
Do you think that Markell's
race played a part in it?

41:27.649 --> 41:29.191
Oh, my God. No.

41:29.244 --> 41:30.981
I'm-I'm...

41:31.420 --> 41:32.881
No, I'm not a racist.

41:32.906 --> 41:34.258
I mean, I've taught
many black children.

41:34.282 --> 41:36.134
Some of the students I'm proudest of

41:36.651 --> 41:38.922
were black... are black. That's...

41:38.947 --> 41:41.416
- I'm not saying...
- Of course.

41:41.856 --> 41:44.893
But let's just stop and look at this.

41:44.927 --> 41:46.695
Okay.

41:46.781 --> 41:51.453
These other African-American
kids, your former students,

41:51.659 --> 41:53.828
they weren't difficult, were they?

41:54.036 --> 41:57.410
Uh, I would... some of
them were difficult.

41:57.492 --> 42:00.061
I-I don't think of it that
way, anyway... difficult.

42:00.275 --> 42:01.512
That's... but the point is,

42:01.537 --> 42:02.972
I've-I've taught all kinds of kids

42:02.997 --> 42:04.332
with all kinds of behaviors.

42:04.357 --> 42:06.325
I've never done anything
like this before.

42:06.562 --> 42:08.432
And I don't know what you're
saying, anyway. I mean

42:08.457 --> 42:10.754
, if I am a racist that's worse.
You should fire me.

42:10.779 --> 42:13.850
Unacknowledged bias
exists in all of us.

42:14.805 --> 42:17.151
Now, the solution isn't
to throw in the towel.

42:17.226 --> 42:19.795
Something like this
should be a wake-up call,

42:19.820 --> 42:22.248
an opportunity to look inside yourself.

42:22.336 --> 42:23.545
If that's what's inside me,

42:23.570 --> 42:25.786
I don't want to know about it.

42:26.368 --> 42:27.833
I'm sorry. I am...

42:27.858 --> 42:29.641
I'm... I am very sorry.

42:29.666 --> 42:31.083
Um...

42:32.087 --> 42:34.073
I just think it's time.

42:35.317 --> 42:39.227
If you really feel this bad, go.

42:39.862 --> 42:43.055
Take the summer, but
don't quit teaching.

42:43.245 --> 42:46.115
You are one of the best
teachers I've ever seen.

42:47.689 --> 42:49.713
Just call it a break

42:49.838 --> 42:51.737
and you'll come back fresh in the fall.

42:54.035 --> 42:56.048
My daughter in California
is always begging me

42:56.073 --> 42:58.372
to spend more time
with my grandchildren.

42:58.528 --> 42:59.887
My pension is already...

42:59.912 --> 43:01.212
I mean, maybe I can sell my house

43:01.237 --> 43:02.600
and buy one of those
little condos or...

43:02.625 --> 43:04.395
This is way too big a decision

43:04.420 --> 43:08.290
to make over one bad class. Okay?

43:09.058 --> 43:11.125
Don't rush into it.

43:13.955 --> 43:15.742
I'd...

43:16.012 --> 43:18.715
No. It's impossible.

43:19.813 --> 43:20.899
Why?

43:21.002 --> 43:22.230
Because...

43:23.326 --> 43:24.716
um...

43:25.287 --> 43:28.390
because it's too late, I'm too old.

43:30.273 --> 43:34.010
Thank you for... trying.

43:45.239 --> 43:46.694
Thank you.

43:57.405 --> 43:59.172
Why are you leaving, Mrs. Carol?

43:59.301 --> 44:01.803
Um, you're gonna have a sub today.

44:01.924 --> 44:03.530
- Wont that be fun?
- Yeah.

44:03.555 --> 44:05.589
Do you have your ancestor stories?

44:06.108 --> 44:07.258
Good, you can tell the sub

44:07.283 --> 44:08.511
what We've been doing, okay?

44:08.551 --> 44:10.778
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a good day.

44:14.008 --> 44:16.477
Ms. Carol, Ms. Carol!

44:17.644 --> 44:21.447
Markell. Oh!

44:23.845 --> 44:25.877
Where are you going?

44:26.488 --> 44:28.878
I have to leave, okay?

44:29.801 --> 44:32.104
Are you coming back tomorrow?

44:32.587 --> 44:36.218
I'm not. I'm not coming
back at all this summer.

44:37.047 --> 44:39.560
But you'll miss me too much.

44:40.335 --> 44:41.762
Come here.

44:42.784 --> 44:44.179
Okay.

44:45.553 --> 44:47.604
Okay, look at me.

44:48.103 --> 44:50.727
- You're a good boy.
- Mm-hmm.

44:51.366 --> 44:54.034
Okay. Go on in.

44:54.116 --> 44:56.411
- Bye, Ms. Carol.
- Bye.

44:57.025 --> 44:59.027
Bye.

45:36.332 --> 45:39.952
So, all of the shovels were
just for digging the tunnel?

45:40.269 --> 45:42.437
Oh, yeah. I mean, I was in there.
I could see it.

45:42.462 --> 45:44.165
Too small for, like, a
normal-sized person?

45:44.190 --> 45:45.902
Ah, you fucking got jokes.

45:45.975 --> 45:47.073
Fucking asshole.

45:47.098 --> 45:49.701
2001 silver Jeep Grand
Cherokee reported stolen

45:49.726 --> 45:51.542
ten blocks southeast
of the Wilcox house.

45:51.567 --> 45:54.036
Owner said it could've been
stolen today or yesterday.

45:54.590 --> 45:56.384
We have to start scouting.

45:59.929 --> 46:01.515
No, no, no, no. Not with me.

46:01.540 --> 46:03.135
Chief had us ride together yesterday.

46:03.198 --> 46:04.630
I don't want a new fucking partner.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.448
Too bad.

46:16.959 --> 46:18.592
It's fucking stupid.

46:18.617 --> 46:20.652
What do they think, he's just
gonna drive right past us?

46:20.677 --> 46:22.212
He's probably five states away by now.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.888
You're right and even if
he did stick around,

46:23.913 --> 46:25.019
he'd get rid of it.

46:25.113 --> 46:26.548
I need some fucking coffee.

46:26.573 --> 46:27.774
Two hours of sleep. Fuck.

46:27.997 --> 46:29.660
Has the opposite effect
on me these days.

46:29.685 --> 46:32.213
If it doesn't make you sleepy,
it'll just give you the runs.

46:32.274 --> 46:33.541
Don't worry.

46:33.566 --> 46:35.688
I wasn't gonna get you one.

46:57.292 --> 46:59.461
Wilcox, stop!

47:05.668 --> 47:07.277
Fuck.

47:17.940 --> 47:19.380
Foot pursuit.

47:19.508 --> 47:21.160
Heading south on Patterson Street.

47:21.304 --> 47:22.560
Copy that.

47:47.595 --> 47:49.427
Braden PD! Hands up!

47:51.966 --> 47:53.301
Gun, gun, gun!

48:10.271 --> 48:11.321
Wilcox, stop!

48:11.567 --> 48:13.630
Braden PD! Stop! Aah!

48:20.982 --> 48:23.642
- Rook, you hit?
- I got shot.

48:28.703 --> 48:30.172
Put your head down.

48:30.318 --> 48:32.253
Get in. Okay.

48:32.394 --> 48:33.820
Put pressure on it, all right?

48:41.036 --> 48:42.566
Here, put on this tourniquet.

48:42.704 --> 48:44.328
Put it above the wound.

48:44.975 --> 48:46.962
Heading west on Grant Street.
We are in pursuit.

48:47.023 --> 48:48.577
What? I'm taking you to the hospital.

48:48.602 --> 48:50.741
You are not, you racist fuck.
We are in pursuit.

48:50.766 --> 48:52.502
We are not losing this asshole.

48:53.574 --> 48:54.976
You got it, sister.

49:06.281 --> 49:07.570
Fuck.

49:09.165 --> 49:11.299
Wilcox! Freeze!

49:13.657 --> 49:15.484
Drop your weapon!

49:22.966 --> 49:26.440
Shots fired. 10-79.

49:28.296 --> 49:29.464
Are you okay?

49:30.137 --> 49:32.139
Ma'am, are you okay?

49:32.975 --> 49:34.810
I have an unresponsive female.

49:34.903 --> 49:36.871
Requesting EMS.
