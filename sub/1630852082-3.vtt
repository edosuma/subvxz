<i>LENNOX: 'There's a few ways
to interview a suspect.</i>

00:10.840 --> 00:14.880
<i>'All too time-consuming,
in my experience.</i>

00:14.880 --> 00:18.760
<i>'Especially when you're dealing with
arrogant monsters.</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:22.600

<i>What's your relationship
with Graham Cornell?</i>

00:45.880 --> 00:50.520
<i>Come on, "my name is Ray", we've
both been through the fellowship.</i>

00:50.520 --> 00:52.320
<i>'So?'</i>

<i>My name is Richie
and I am a drug addict.</i>

00:56.960 --> 00:58.640
<i>So we're both flawed men.</i>

00:58.640 --> 01:00.080
<i>Men of secrets.</i>

01:00.080 --> 01:02.160
<i>How flawed are you?</i>

<i>Where do you stop at

01:05.280 --> 01:07.600
<i>You don't like me, do you, Lennox?</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:12.960
<i>I see you as a typical schemie
given a smidgen of power.</i>

<i>Which parent was the Bolshevik?</i>

01:14.800 --> 01:16.520
<i>Father? Mother?</i>

<i>Yesterday, I held a dead child
in my arms.</i>

01:22.760 --> 01:26.680
<i>She had been kidnapped,
drugged, raped and murdered.</i>

01:26.680 --> 01:28.800
<i>If you were part of that in any way,</i>

01:28.800 --> 01:32.200
<i>that's the reason I have

we are all fucked!</i>

02:40.000 --> 02:42.160
<i>Right, that's just what
I'm trying to establish.</i>

02:42.160 --> 02:45.040
<i>No! No! Drummond is going

02:45.040 --> 02:47.600
<i>He's not who you think he is.
I know him.</i>

02:47.600 --> 02:49.480
<i>There's things
that I need to say to him.</i>

02:49.480 --> 02:52.840
<i>That's exactly why
you shouldn't be in there.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:55.000
<i>You brought him in

02:55.000 --> 02:56.520
<i>You have an agenda with this guy!</i>

02:56.520 --> 02:59.080
<i>Well, my agenda certainly
isn't to protect him!</i>

03:00.120 --> 03:01.520
<i>What?!</i>

03:01.520 --> 03:05.520
<i>You haven't even got a clue
what my job entails, Ray.</i>

03:05.520 --> 03:08.560
<i>Well, I know it seems to involve
more politicking than policing.</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:09.760
<i>You have to...</i>

03:11.080 --> 03:12.720
<i>What?</i>

03:12.720 --> 03:17.840
<i>Pray tell, as your superior officer,
what do I have to do?</i>

<i>Amanda!</i>

03:22.480 --> 03:26.240
<i>Go in there,

<i>I am Richie Gulliver,

03:40.040 --> 03:42.640
<i>and part of the
police committee for Scotland.</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:45.960

<i>'are we not?'
'I would certainly both hope'</i>

03:48.400 --> 03:50.720

Needs must, but, though, eh?</i>

04:08.320 --> 04:09.800
<i>Oh, aye, is that right?</i>

04:09.800 --> 04:11.120
<i>Don't you fuck about, Dougie.</i>

<i>An obsequious woke liberal against
an over-privileged Tory prick.</i>

<i>And I'm ringside!</i>

04:16.520 --> 04:18.760
<i>Can you fucking pretend

Dougie, go get him.</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:49.600
<i>It's a shame about
these renovations.</i>

04:49.600 --> 04:51.280
<i>I'll take him the scenic route.</i>

04:51.280 --> 04:53.320
<i>I'm gonna enjoy
winding this prick up.</i>

04:53.320 --> 04:55.640
<i>I thought because
you're a member of the...</i>

04:55.640 --> 04:57.960
<i>The only reason
I'm even speaking to you,</i>

04:57.960 --> 05:00.480

<i>I'm Ralf Wilberforce.</i>

05:25.600 --> 05:27.080
<i>Follow me, Ralfie.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:35.360
<i>Mind that big, daft head of yours.</i>

05:37.040 --> 05:38.400
<i>I didn't get your name.</i>

05:38.400 --> 05:39.760
<i>I didn't give you it.</i>

05:39.760 --> 05:42.640
<i>Is this the right way
to the interview room?</i>

05:42.640 --> 05:44.720
<i>You'll have to excuse us.</i>

05:44.720 --> 05:47.360

05:55.880 --> 05:58.000
<i>I'm investigating a murder.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:00.760
<i>You think I like

06:00.760 --> 06:02.240
<i>Want to find your own way?</i>

06:02.240 --> 06:05.840
<i>No, it's just a bloody labyrinth.</i>

<i>CLATTERING</i>

06:13.000 --> 06:15.280
<i>Workers these days
don't give a fuck.</i>

06:15.280 --> 06:17.760
<i>That's why Britain's one
of the world's shithole countries.</i>

06:17.760 --> 06:19.440
<i>But mind you, why should they?</i>

06:19.440 --> 06:21.320
<i>Cos it's all set up
for the rich only.</i>

06:21.320 --> 06:23.360
<i>And I'm not saying
independence is the answer,</i>

06:23.360 --> 06:24.920
<i>we just fuck things up.</i>

06:24.920 --> 06:26.160
<i>Listen to the wise words here.</i>

06:26.160 --> 06:28.520
<i>Right, you'll need to give that

06:28.520 --> 06:29.880
<i>What, you want me to...?</i>

06:29.880 --> 06:32.160
<i>Well, I've done my wrist in,

06:32.160 --> 06:34.000
<i>Take a deek at that.</i>

06:34.000 --> 06:37.040
<i>You'll manage, though, a big,
strong laddie like yourself. Go on.</i>

06:40.080 --> 06:41.320
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

06:41.320 --> 06:42.920
<i>Give it some welly! Pull it!</i>

06:42.920 --> 06:46.240
<i>Pull it. Pull it like you're trying
to pull a person of colour</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:48.520
<i>off your sister!
What did you just say?</i>

06:48.520 --> 06:50.640
<i>You can't say that,
you're a police officer.</i>

06:50.640 --> 06:53.800
<i>Aye, it's hard to defend that kind
of fucking racism, isn't it?</i>

06:53.800 --> 06:56.000
<i>How's it feel
when you do it in court?</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:58.240
<i>My job is to defend my clients.</i>

06:58.240 --> 06:59.680
<i>Racist clients like "Gullible"?</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:02.200
<i>Richie Gulliver
is a populist politician,</i>

07:02.200 --> 07:04.120
<i>and I don't happen
to agree with his views.</i>

07:04.120 --> 07:06.840
<i>So it's all right for the likes of
him to be racist?</i> <i>I never said that.</i>

07:06.840 --> 07:09.360
<i>Don't give me any of your shite.
You wanna be here all day?</i> <i>No!</i>

07:09.360 --> 07:10.720
<i>Then try pushing it, daftie.</i>

<i>of the pain that they cause.</i>

07:23.640 --> 07:25.200
<i>Give me a shot at him!
No.</i>

07:26.640 --> 07:28.880

07:32.560 --> 07:34.480
<i>Aye, few and far between now,</i>

07:34.480 --> 07:37.680
<i>but probably more racism
for your boys in the courts</i>

07:37.680 --> 07:39.520
<i>than you'll find
on the force these days.</i>

07:39.520 --> 07:40.600
<i>It's a different thing.</i>

07:40.600 --> 07:43.280
<i>Gulliver and I might be
poles apart politically,</i>

<i>See, the one thing
you've both got in common</i>

07:52.640 --> 07:55.960
<i>is that you rely on pricks like us

07:55.960 --> 07:58.080
<i>We do it with grace.</i>

07:58.080 --> 08:00.120

Do you ken what he's on about?</i>

08:22.160 --> 08:23.600
<i>No, but I must insist...</i>

08:23.600 --> 08:26.600
<i>I'm thinking of the hard face

09:02.880 --> 09:04.240

<i>but I have no knowledge

09:25.080 --> 09:28.080

09:28.080 --> 09:29.400
<i>And the purpose of that</i>

said details in my head.</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:36.960
<i>I understand. And your
cooperation is appreciated.</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:39.800

<i>the most despicable
child murder investigation</i>

25:06.920 --> 25:08.080
<i>Ah!
The pool, yeah?</i>

25:08.080 --> 25:09.760

<i>Hello, Dougie. Gulliver's lawyer

<i>Come on!</i>

<i>I've not got a racist bone

25:43.240 --> 25:46.280
<i>The problem was that I didn't

<i>I mean, I like a laugh.</i>

25:47.800 --> 25:49.160
<i>What did he say to you?</i>

25:49.160 --> 25:51.080
<i>Oh, no, I'd rather not say.</i>

25:51.080 --> 25:53.800
<i>When I get offended by something,
I just suck it up.</i>

25:53.800 --> 25:57.600
<i>I don't go off running to authority

<i>Come on, boss? What's the script?
Surely it's my word against his?</i>

26:05.800 --> 26:08.880

<i>Come in, sit down.</i>

26:25.520 --> 26:27.080

<i>Hey.</i>

26:42.560 --> 26:44.480
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

26:44.480 --> 26:46.400
<i>I think I'm being harassed.</i>

26:46.400 --> 26:48.440
<i>Sometimes it feels
like they're joking,</i>

26:48.440 --> 26:51.240
<i>and then other times
it's much more serious.</i>

26:51.240 --> 26:54.880
<i>Nobody should be made

26:54.880 --> 26:58.160
<i>We cannot tolerate any kind

26:58.160 --> 27:00.480
<i>So we will go and see
the head of HR.</i>

27:00.480 --> 27:03.040
<i>I can't.</i> <i>I will come with you.
I will support you the whole way.</i>

<i>Do you know what?
Some men are just entitled pigs.</i>

27:05.560 --> 27:08.800
<i>We've all met them before. And...
What's his name?</i>

27:08.800 --> 27:10.440
<i>It's not a man.</i>

27:11.440 --> 27:13.120
<i>It's not just a man.</i>

27:13.120 --> 27:15.640
<i>And I can't go to the head of HR
because...</i>

27:17.440 --> 27:18.840
<i>..because it's her, too.</i>

27:18.840 --> 27:20.200
<i>You mean Estelle?</i>

27:20.200 --> 27:24.560
<i>Every time I see them, they're
making these suggestive comments.</i>

27:24.560 --> 27:26.920
<i>Telling me I should come
to parties with them</i>

27:26.920 --> 27:29.040
<i>and I should come round
to their place for a drink.</i>

27:29.040 --> 27:30.760

<i>He's ripped the piss out of us for

<i>I'm not getting the impression</i>

39:08.400 --> 39:11.160
<i>He's a feeble-minded,

40:13.320 --> 40:14.960
<i>He's just been picked up.</i>

40:14.960 --> 40:16.800
<i>He assaulted Gulliver in the street!</i>

40:16.800 --> 40:17.840
<i>That's shocking.</i>

40:20.560 --> 40:23.880
<i>The press are all over this.
There's no way Gulliver can deny it.</i>

40:23.880 --> 40:25.440
<i>Let's let it play out.</i>

40:25.440 --> 40:28.600
<i>So we can eliminate both Gulliver
and Cornell from our suspect list.</i>

40:28.600 --> 40:31.320
<i>Which means we have no suspects
and we've got no leads.</i>

40:31.320 --> 40:33.440

that white van, eh?'</i>

40:33.440 --> 40:34.720

41:25.920 --> 41:27.120
<i>Aye.</i>

41:28.680 --> 41:33.480
<i>No.</i> <i>Ray was saying that his dad
used to work on the railways.</i>

41:33.480 --> 41:34.640
<i>Mine did, too.</i>

41:34.640 --> 41:37.200
<i>I'm sure he'll mention it.
Oh, speak of the devil.</i>

41:38.600 --> 41:40.920
<i>Dad.
Well, son.</i>

41:40.920 --> 41:42.560
<i>This is Trudi.</i>

41:42.560 --> 41:46.880

41:48.480 --> 41:49.560
<i>John!</i>

41:49.560 --> 41:53.160
<i>John. So, I hear that you used
to work for British Rail.</i>

41:53.160 --> 41:55.960
<i>Aye, used to be a driver,
freight mostly,</i>

41:55.960 --> 41:59.440
<i>but I became an office man
when my heart got bad.</i>

42:00.800 --> 42:04.800
<i>So, we're just waiting
on Stuart, yeah?</i>

42:04.800 --> 42:06.400
<i>What a surprise (!)</i>

42:06.400 --> 42:08.680

42:24.920 --> 42:28.520
<i>Yeah. Pleased to meet you, Stuart.
And you, too, Trudi!</i>

42:28.520 --> 42:32.120
<i>Il mondo! I mean,

42:34.600 --> 42:36.600
<i>Leading lady looks!</i>

<i>HE CHUCKLES</i>

43:11.720 --> 43:12.880
<i>Thanks.</i>

43:12.880 --> 43:18.560
<i>I can't help being the brother of
a copper, but actually dating one?</i>

43:18.560 --> 43:21.400
<i>That is a very brave choice,
I shiteth thee not!</i>

43:21.400 --> 43:24.760
<i>But how can I resist a hunk
like this, right, Stuart?</i>

43:24.760 --> 43:30.200
<i>Relationships are all timing,
and ours is lousy.</i>

43:30.200 --> 43:32.760
<i>Don't worry, I'm not trying
to steal her from you, Ray!</i>

43:32.760 --> 43:34.360
<i>That's a relief!</i>

43:34.360 --> 43:38.360
<i>I would not wish a life of dating
a thesp on anyone, my darling.</i>

43:38.360 --> 43:41.720
<i>I mean, the things
that you have to do while resting,</i>

43:41.720 --> 43:44.120
<i>like literally prostitute yourself.</i>

43:44.120 --> 43:48.680
<i>But, er... But a cop?
No, that's a bridge too far!</i>

43:48.680 --> 43:50.240
<i>Appreciate your support (!)</i>

43:50.240 --> 43:52.400
<i>Nah, there's no support here, Ray.</i>

43:52.400 --> 43:55.200
<i>In fact, you constantly
astonish me...</i>

43:55.200 --> 43:57.600
<i>Come on, you two!
There's no two involved here, Jack.</i>

43:57.600 --> 44:00.440
<i>Once again, it's Stuart's private
party with us mere conscripts.</i>

44:00.440 --> 44:02.920
<i>How you can do that job
is beyond belief, you know?</i>

44:02.920 --> 44:06.720
<i>A working class lad
from a council estate.</i>

44:06.720 --> 44:09.960
<i>And you protect the rich
and you shit on the poor!</i>

44:09.960 --> 44:12.400
<i>Are you interested
in red wine, Trudi?</i>

44:12.400 --> 44:14.880
<i>I'm quite a fan of this red one.</i>

44:14.880 --> 44:17.400
<i>Yeah, no, definitely.
I appreciate a drop of red.</i>

44:17.400 --> 44:21.640
<i>There's this myth
of a pluralist society,</i>

44:21.640 --> 44:24.200
<i>where you blue-shirted
Stormtroopers of capital</i>

44:24.200 --> 44:25.720
<i>can somehow be a neutral force...</i>

44:25.720 --> 44:28.240
<i>Who do you think the people
in Pilton, Niddrie, Muirhouse</i>

44:28.240 --> 44:31.120
<i>and Wester Hailes call when the bad
bastards are fucking them over?</i>

44:31.120 --> 44:33.560
<i>Do you think they send for an actor
to sort out their problems</i>

44:33.560 --> 44:36.280
<i>with a Shakespearian recitation?
No. Do they fuck!</i>

44:36.280 --> 44:37.320
<i>Raymond!</i>

44:39.800 --> 44:43.040
<i>Stuart, what was your last TV role?
River City. You know that.</i>

44:43.040 --> 44:44.240
<i>And you played?</i>

44:45.840 --> 44:48.040
<i>A drug dealer.
Yes.</i>

44:48.040 --> 44:49.720
<i>And the one before that?</i>

44:49.720 --> 44:55.320
<i>A, er, multiple rapist, people

44:55.320 --> 44:57.120
<i>RAY LAUGHS
OK, OK.</i>

44:57.120 --> 45:00.400
<i>So, who has the reductive career?</i>

45:00.400 --> 45:03.640
<i>I just lock up people like that,
I don't try to be them.</i>

45:08.040 --> 45:10.880
<i>Ray Lennox, I am so proud of you.</i>

45:10.880 --> 45:12.080
<i>Why?</i>

45:14.400 --> 45:17.080
<i>You wanted a drink tonight,
didn't you?</i>

45:17.080 --> 45:19.800
<i>Aye, you know, just one
to stop the voices in my...</i>

45:19.800 --> 45:21.240
<i>Just for a while.</i>

<i>When you have your little hunches...
Aye.</i>

45:37.840 --> 45:40.160
<i>..when you're working a case, yeah?
Mm-hm.</i>

45:40.160 --> 45:43.400
<i>How do you verify them?</i>

45:44.440 --> 45:46.880
<i>Well, you know, you gather evidence.</i>

45:46.880 --> 45:49.680
<i>You find out about the person
you're investigating,</i>

45:49.680 --> 45:53.200
<i>where they live, work, play,
who they associate with,</i>

45:53.200 --> 45:55.960
<i>and... what they're hiding.</i>

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
<i>What if they're hiding nothing?
HE SCOFFS</i>

45:57.960 --> 45:59.960
<i>They're always hiding something.</i>

45:59.960 --> 46:02.320
<i>I'm not hiding nothing!
Ha-ha.</i>

46:03.600 --> 46:07.120
<i>What are you hiding?
Nothing... from you.</i>

46:07.120 --> 46:09.920
<i>Everything from

46:11.400 --> 46:12.520
<i>Yeah?</i>

46:12.520 --> 46:14.760
<i>Sounds like two work colleagues
