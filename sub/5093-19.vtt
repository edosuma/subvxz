Reagan, I got her wallet.

00:15.423 --> 00:17.039
Bank cards and cash
still in there?

00:17.041 --> 00:18.407
Yep.

00:18.409 --> 00:19.542
We thinking it's personal?

00:19.544 --> 00:20.593
Judging by
the bruising

00:20.595 --> 00:22.845
on the neck, she was
strangled to death.

00:22.847 --> 00:24.180
You know what that means.

00:24.182 --> 00:25.347
Nine times out of ten...

00:25.349 --> 00:27.266
The killer knew the victim.
That's right.

00:27.268 --> 00:28.968
She didn't die here, either.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.636
She was dragged over here

00:30.638 --> 00:31.971
and posed like this.

00:31.973 --> 00:34.590
Look at her. Arms crossed,
crucifix in her hands.

00:34.592 --> 00:36.275
Like she's laid out
at her own wake.

00:36.277 --> 00:37.309
Yeah.

00:37.311 --> 00:38.277
Some kind of ritual?

00:38.279 --> 00:40.196
Or a mocking gesture.
Who is she?

00:40.198 --> 00:42.148
Uh, Kathleen D'Amato.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.649
20 years old.

00:43.651 --> 00:46.619
Kings County
Community College I.D.

00:46.621 --> 00:47.870
Resides in Brooklyn.

00:47.872 --> 00:50.072
Well, not anymore.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.044
What?

00:55.046 --> 00:57.279
She kind of reminds me
of the pretty Italian girl

00:57.281 --> 01:00.282
in high school that all the
Irish boys fell in love with.

01:00.284 --> 01:01.617
The one that got away?

01:01.619 --> 01:02.784
Nope.

01:02.786 --> 01:04.804
The one I married.

01:04.806 --> 01:06.722
(sighs)

01:14.097 --> 01:15.097
Sir?

01:15.099 --> 01:16.265
I'm coming, Baker.

01:18.068 --> 01:19.935
We're gonna need
ten minutes.

01:19.937 --> 01:21.320
Tell my detail.

01:21.322 --> 01:23.405
BAKER:
Yes, sir.

01:25.342 --> 01:26.575
About an hour ago,

01:26.577 --> 01:29.078
two Miami cops were shot
by an ex-NYPD officer.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.163
One fatally.

01:31.165 --> 01:32.998
Is he in custody?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.316
No, he's in the wind.

01:34.318 --> 01:36.952
Are they positive on the I.D.?

01:36.954 --> 01:39.655
The cop who survived
was the investigator

01:39.657 --> 01:42.541
who turned him down for the job
in their department.

01:42.543 --> 01:45.594
He I.D.'d him
as one Pedro Mendoza.

01:45.596 --> 01:47.012
Six years on the job here.

01:47.014 --> 01:48.964
Retired NYPD?

01:48.966 --> 01:50.549
No. Terminated.

01:55.338 --> 01:56.889
They're gonna want
his psych report,

01:56.891 --> 02:00.509
his termination transcripts,
all the evaluations.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.177
They have some of that
from his application.

02:02.179 --> 02:04.230
The rest I've ordered up
to be released to them

02:04.232 --> 02:06.065
pending your go-ahead.
And reach out

02:06.067 --> 02:07.533
to his former C.O.'s.

02:07.535 --> 02:09.651
See if we can harvest anything
about his personal life.

02:09.654 --> 02:10.703
Good idea.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.187
What about the fatality?

02:12.189 --> 02:13.205
A sergeant.

02:13.207 --> 02:15.908
15 years on the job,
wife and two kids.

02:17.911 --> 02:20.713
(sighs)

02:20.715 --> 02:23.198
Baker, get me Chief Brooks
of the Miami PD.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.750
Frank?

02:24.752 --> 02:26.919
I know it's not on us,

02:26.921 --> 02:29.421
but it's like a punch
in the gut anyway.

02:35.145 --> 02:36.595
I hate this part.

02:36.597 --> 02:39.048
All they want
are answers,

02:39.050 --> 02:41.049
and all we got
are questions.

02:58.451 --> 02:59.585
Cops?

02:59.587 --> 03:01.370
Yes, sir.
Detective Reagan.

03:01.372 --> 03:02.671
This is Detective Baez.

03:02.673 --> 03:03.756
You're Kathleen's father?

03:03.758 --> 03:06.508
Vince D'Amato.

03:06.510 --> 03:08.744
Well, we're very sorry
for your loss, sir.

03:08.746 --> 03:10.930
Uh, we have a few questions
we need to ask.

03:10.932 --> 03:13.015
You think you might
be up for it right now?

03:13.017 --> 03:15.301
Yeah. Right this way.

03:21.808 --> 03:22.891
Your wife?

03:22.893 --> 03:24.610
(sighs):
Yeah.

03:24.612 --> 03:26.428
Rosa died last year.

03:26.430 --> 03:28.096
Uh, I guess I'm thankful

03:28.098 --> 03:29.598
she didn't have
to go through this.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.601
Mr. D'Amato, can you tell us
when was the last time

03:32.603 --> 03:34.203
you had contact
with your daughter?

03:34.205 --> 03:37.039
Yeah. We were working
at the store till about 5:00,

03:37.041 --> 03:39.441
then she went off to school.

03:39.443 --> 03:41.377
We were in the middle
of inventory.

03:41.379 --> 03:43.545
Kathleen had a...
a great system.

03:43.547 --> 03:45.748
But I couldn't understand it.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.300
We have reason to think
that Kathleen knew

03:48.302 --> 03:49.451
the person who did this.

03:49.453 --> 03:50.886
Do you know of any conflicts

03:50.888 --> 03:52.137
she had with anyone recently?

03:52.139 --> 03:53.288
A boyfriend?

03:53.290 --> 03:54.757
No, she didn't have a boyfriend.

03:54.759 --> 03:56.392
It was just the two of us.

03:56.394 --> 03:57.726
What about friends?

03:57.728 --> 03:58.811
Any enemies?

03:58.813 --> 04:01.146
(chuckling):
Enemies? No.

04:01.148 --> 04:02.798
I mean, I don't think so.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.149
She was a sweet girl.

04:04.151 --> 04:07.019
Okay. She have any issues
with anyone at school?

04:07.021 --> 04:08.687
Anything you can think of?

04:08.689 --> 04:10.489
Not that I know of.

04:10.491 --> 04:11.940
She was an art student.

04:11.942 --> 04:15.778
Truth is she was only there
a couple times a week.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.279
Working in the studio
all by herself.

04:18.281 --> 04:20.332
She was a good person,
Detective.

04:20.334 --> 04:22.251
Of course.

04:22.253 --> 04:23.619
Too good sometimes.

04:23.621 --> 04:25.537
And you are?

04:25.539 --> 04:28.123
This is Joe Ferraro.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.958
Joe's like a son to me.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.044
You say too good,
uh, how do you mean?

04:32.929 --> 04:35.514
Meaning she would
talk to anybody.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.549
Strangers, homeless guys,

04:37.551 --> 04:39.551
creeps on the subway
trying to hit on her.

04:39.553 --> 04:41.103
Kathleen had a good heart.

04:41.105 --> 04:43.355
She always saw the
best in people.

04:43.357 --> 04:44.390
Of course.

04:44.392 --> 04:46.275
Um, do you know
if she was dating

04:46.277 --> 04:48.394
any of these strangers
or creeps, by any chance?

04:48.396 --> 04:49.511
No.

04:49.513 --> 04:51.563
She was a good Catholic girl.

04:51.565 --> 04:53.148
She just always

04:53.150 --> 04:55.868
gave everybody
the benefit of the doubt.

04:57.037 --> 04:58.904
And now look
what happened.

05:06.579 --> 05:08.831
Vince makes Kathleen
sound like Mother Teresa.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.599
Yeah, well, that's what
fathers do sometimes.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.085
You know, it's that
unconditional love thing.

05:13.087 --> 05:15.504
20-year-old beauty
like that and no boyfriend?

05:15.506 --> 05:17.039

for multiple excessive
force complaints.

06:18.650 --> 06:20.733
And the guy was

And he had
an edge to him.

06:22.154 --> 06:23.703

whether he'd just

06:23.705 --> 06:26.623
swallow a reprimand or he was
about to haul off on you.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.209
Ever on you?

06:31.997 --> 06:34.547
Who else did he have
a beef with?

06:34.549 --> 06:36.749
Just about everybody above him.

Uh, the guy that got
his locker next,

07:11.069 --> 07:12.568
when he opened it,

07:12.570 --> 07:15.255
Mendoza had written,
uh, in black magic marker

07:15.257 --> 07:19.626
on the inside of it:
"Welcome to Fort Surrender.

07:19.628 --> 07:23.079
Sergeant Renzulli,
Chicken in Chief."

07:23.081 --> 07:26.099

We need to ask you

a few questions about
Kathleen D'Amato.

07:49.708 --> 07:51.274
God, I-I still can't
believe what happened.

07:51.276 --> 07:53.209
Do you know...
do you know who did this?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.445
Well, we were hoping you
could help us out with that.

07:55.447 --> 07:56.579
Her cell phone records show

07:56.581 --> 07:58.631
you were the last person
she spoke to.

07:58.633 --> 08:01.450
Was she acting stressed-out
or saying anything unusual?

08:01.452 --> 08:02.468
No.

08:02.470 --> 08:03.636
No, not at all.

08:03.638 --> 08:06.422
I-I just called to set up
a study group with her.

08:06.424 --> 08:07.473
So you were friends?

08:07.475 --> 08:08.457
Yeah.

08:08.459 --> 08:10.143
All of us in the
group are friends.

08:10.145 --> 08:11.561
These other art students,

08:11.563 --> 08:13.646
do you have all
their information?

08:13.648 --> 08:15.765
Art students?

08:15.767 --> 08:17.350
We were studying Arabic.

08:17.352 --> 08:18.801
Arabic?

08:18.803 --> 08:20.436
Is something wrong?

08:20.438 --> 08:21.521
Her father

08:21.523 --> 08:23.639
was under the impression
she was an art major.

08:23.641 --> 08:26.743
Yeah, well, she was probably
just trying to protect him.

08:26.745 --> 08:28.861
From?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.480
You a Muslim?

08:31.482 --> 08:32.832
I noticed the Koran

08:32.833 --> 08:34.333
in your bag.
You're Muslim?

08:34.336 --> 08:35.650
(chuckles)

08:35.653 --> 08:37.419
We don't all wear burkas.

08:37.422 --> 08:39.422
I mean, I-I dress
more conservatively

08:39.424 --> 08:40.623
when I go to mosque,

08:40.625 --> 08:43.259
just like someone would
for temple or church,

08:43.260 --> 08:45.328
and I don't eat pork
or drink alcohol,

08:45.330 --> 08:46.462
but other than that,

08:46.464 --> 08:47.847
I'm just like
any other student here.

08:47.849 --> 08:50.717
Did Kathleen
go to mosque with you?

08:50.719 --> 08:52.101
No.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.436
She have any other secrets?

08:53.438 --> 08:55.855
Like, uh, maybe
a Muslim boyfriend?

08:55.857 --> 08:57.890
I don't know.

08:57.892 --> 08:59.675
Look, whoever
did this to her

08:59.677 --> 09:00.860
knew her.

09:00.862 --> 09:02.578
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?

09:02.580 --> 09:05.398
No. He was...
he was crazy about her.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.850
He would... he would never
lay a finger on her.

09:07.852 --> 09:09.369
(sighs)

09:09.371 --> 09:10.737
Who's "he"?

09:10.739 --> 09:13.373
She never told me his name.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.358
But she talked about him a lot.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.542
Were they dating?

09:16.544 --> 09:19.128
No. Kathleen was very shy.

09:19.130 --> 09:22.465
She was waiting for him
to make the first move.

09:22.467 --> 09:24.217
He was Muslim.

09:25.636 --> 09:26.886
I think she
may have gone

09:26.888 --> 09:28.471
to the same mosque as him.

09:28.473 --> 09:29.972
Which one?

09:30.841 --> 09:33.042
The one on Fulton.

09:35.763 --> 09:37.980
(man singing
Islamic call to prayer)

09:42.236 --> 09:44.187

10:20.258 --> 10:21.974
I understand that
from your message.

10:21.976 --> 10:24.360
But I don't see what that
has to do with us.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.445
We're trying to track down

10:25.447 --> 10:26.762
people that she
hung around with,

10:26.764 --> 10:28.481
and we understand
that she hung around

10:28.483 --> 10:29.732
with somebody from this mosque.

10:29.734 --> 10:31.367
I don't like
what you're implying.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.736
We're not implying
anything, are we?

10:33.738 --> 10:35.788
No, we're not.
Look, we'd just like to speak

10:35.790 --> 10:36.956
to her friend, is all.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.574
Being friends isn't a crime.

10:38.576 --> 10:39.992
No, it's not a crime,

10:39.994 --> 10:41.661
and we're not trying
to make it a crime.

10:41.663 --> 10:43.379
We would just like
to speak to this guy

10:43.381 --> 10:44.997
and see if we can right a wrong.

10:47.117 --> 10:48.617
The few times she came he,

10:48.619 --> 10:50.553
she was with one young man

10:50.555 --> 10:53.589
who's a member
of our congregation.

10:53.591 --> 10:56.309
I don't know the nature
of their... relationship.

10:56.311 --> 11:00.296
Okay. But do you know
the nature of his name?

11:04.067 --> 11:05.568
So, how are we
gonna play this?

11:05.570 --> 11:07.019
Let's work under
the assumption

11:07.021 --> 11:08.771
he's the boyfriend
nobody knows about.

11:08.773 --> 11:10.940
Makes sense.
(knocking)

11:11.859 --> 11:13.276
Try to get him to fess up.

11:13.278 --> 11:15.411
If he does,
we, uh, get to go home early.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.746
How's that sound?

11:16.748 --> 11:18.498
Sarcastic.

11:22.286 --> 11:23.619
Salem Haddad?

11:23.621 --> 11:25.588
Yes. Can I help you?

11:25.590 --> 11:26.839
We need to ask you
some questions

11:26.841 --> 11:28.324
about Kathleen D'Amato.

11:28.326 --> 11:29.825
Of course.

11:29.827 --> 11:32.828
Come in.

11:35.466 --> 11:37.934
Go ahead. Sit down.

11:37.936 --> 11:40.353
You take classes at
Kings Community College?

11:40.355 --> 11:43.055
Yes. That's where
I met Kathleen.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.641
She was just wandering
around the campus.

11:45.643 --> 11:47.477
She looked... lost.

11:47.479 --> 11:49.462
We started to talk.

11:49.464 --> 11:50.846
She was very smart.

11:50.848 --> 11:53.115
You two became close?

11:53.117 --> 11:54.784
We were friends.

11:54.786 --> 11:57.203
Friends? Or more than friends?

11:57.205 --> 11:58.621
Friends.

11:58.623 --> 12:00.656
Did you know
she was studying Arabic?

12:00.658 --> 12:02.241
I did.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.659
Was she doing that for you?

12:03.661 --> 12:05.661
I don't know.

12:05.663 --> 12:07.296
I hoped so.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.049
Was she your girlfriend?

12:10.051 --> 12:12.585
(chuckles)

12:12.587 --> 12:15.505
I had feelings for her.

12:15.507 --> 12:17.590
And did she have feelings back?

12:18.475 --> 12:20.476
I don't know.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.144
I wanted to ask her.

12:22.146 --> 12:23.679
Now it's too late.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.733
We're putting together
a timeline

12:27.735 --> 12:29.435
leading up
to Kathleen's murder--

12:29.437 --> 12:32.488
where she was before her death,
where she was going.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.023
Can you help us with that?

12:34.025 --> 12:35.691
Good.

12:35.693 --> 12:37.860
Where were you
at approximately 10:00 the night

12:37.862 --> 12:39.328
Kathleen
was murdered?

12:39.330 --> 12:41.614
I didn't kill Kathleen.

12:41.616 --> 12:43.232
I loved her.

12:43.234 --> 12:45.084
Oh, now we're going
from feelings to love?

12:46.453 --> 12:47.453
Where were you?

12:47.455 --> 12:49.705
I was working
at the Kamal Market.

12:49.707 --> 12:51.257
It's right on the corner.

12:51.259 --> 12:52.758
We were supposed
to see each other

12:52.760 --> 12:54.043
when I got off,
but she...

12:54.045 --> 12:55.711
she never showed up.

12:55.713 --> 12:56.896
(clattering)

12:56.898 --> 12:58.014
Somebody else here?

12:58.016 --> 12:59.765
My brother Mustafa.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.767
He lives here, too.

13:01.769 --> 13:02.768
You Mustafa?

13:02.770 --> 13:03.769
Yes.

13:03.771 --> 13:05.137
Why are you talking to them?

13:05.139 --> 13:06.639
Can't you see
that they think

13:06.641 --> 13:08.524
you're a suspect
in this whore's murder?

13:08.526 --> 13:09.758
She wasn't a whore,

13:09.760 --> 13:11.193
and they're just trying to help.

13:11.195 --> 13:13.195
How many times
do I have to tell you

13:13.197 --> 13:14.864
that cops don't help our kind?

13:14.866 --> 13:17.149
Why don't you both settle down,
all right?

13:17.151 --> 13:19.201
What kind is that
you're talking about?

13:19.203 --> 13:20.820
You know exactly what I mean.

13:20.822 --> 13:23.039
(sighs)
Where were you at 10:00

13:23.041 --> 13:25.074
the night
of this "whore's" murder?

13:25.076 --> 13:26.942
I'm not answering that question.
Why not?

13:26.944 --> 13:28.377
Because I don't have to.

13:28.379 --> 13:30.112
It's in your Constitution.

13:30.114 --> 13:31.747
It's everyone's Constitution.

13:31.749 --> 13:33.666
Including Kathleen D'Amato's.

13:34.551 --> 13:36.719
Are we under arrest?

13:38.772 --> 13:39.955
Are we?!

13:39.957 --> 13:41.957
No.

13:46.346 --> 13:47.313
Then please leave.

13:47.315 --> 13:49.231
Mustafa!
Be quiet, Salem!

13:51.602 --> 13:55.321
If you think you've got a case
against us, prove it.

13:55.323 --> 13:56.989
Now, get out.

13:57.858 --> 13:59.358
Okay.

14:06.650 --> 14:09.818
FRANK: There is no one in this room
who got where he is

14:09.820 --> 14:12.371
by sitting back and waiting
for further developments.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.639
Or by jumping the gun.

14:13.641 --> 14:16.258
I think we're saying
the same thing here, really.

14:16.260 --> 14:17.209
Are we?

14:17.211 --> 14:18.544
With all due respect, no.

14:18.546 --> 14:20.596
Well, at least that's settled.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.830
Worst-case scenario

14:21.832 --> 14:24.333
if the PC puts the department
on high alert.

14:24.335 --> 14:28.220
Tens of thousands
of armed officers on a manhunt

14:28.222 --> 14:32.441
for a five-ten, 165-pound
Hispanic male,

14:32.443 --> 14:34.527
the description of
which happens to fit

14:34.529 --> 14:37.313
tens of thousands
of our population,

14:37.315 --> 14:38.948
none of them our cop killer.

14:38.950 --> 14:40.566
Unless he's here.
Then there's one.

14:40.568 --> 14:42.618
In the future, maybe.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.286
Right now,
it's a recipe for disaster.

14:44.288 --> 14:46.872
Oh, come on. I got more faith
in my people than that.

14:46.874 --> 14:49.158
Frank, it's math, not faith.
We're not saying...

14:49.160 --> 14:50.459
All right, strike it.

14:50.461 --> 14:52.495
Let's just say
for the sake of this

14:52.497 --> 14:54.196
that the profile,
the boss-hater,

14:54.198 --> 14:55.665
is what's driving him.

14:55.667 --> 14:56.966
He got bounced from the 12th.

14:56.968 --> 14:59.468
So we shine a light on the 12th?
Why not?

14:59.470 --> 15:01.087
(scoffs)
You think these guys only talk

15:01.089 --> 15:02.805
to the other cops
in their precinct?

15:02.807 --> 15:04.423
Within hours,
word will be out

15:04.425 --> 15:06.392
at every precinct
in all five boroughs.

15:06.394 --> 15:08.678
We'll have everybody
jumping out of their skins

15:08.680 --> 15:10.896
when, for all we know,
Mendoza's holed up

15:10.898 --> 15:13.549
in Miami.

15:18.855 --> 15:20.656
Hey.
Hey.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.197
I checked the surveillance tapes
at the market where Salem works.

15:23.198 --> 15:23.790
And?

15:23.795 --> 15:26.028
He was there,
so he's off the list.

15:26.030 --> 15:27.830
Great. I didn't like him
for this anyway.

15:27.832 --> 15:29.448
What about you?
Any luck with his brother?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.534
Well, his big brother Mustafa,
on the other hand,

15:31.536 --> 15:33.085
he's a very angry young man.

15:33.087 --> 15:34.620
He's got a bunch of summons

15:34.622 --> 15:36.405
for disorderly conduct
and harassment.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.424
What kind of harassment?
Standing outside of the mosque

15:38.426 --> 15:40.676
harassing women as they walked
by for the way they're dressed.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.713
Smart money says it's because
they looked like "whores."

15:43.715 --> 15:44.847
Hmm, what a charmer.

15:44.849 --> 15:46.348
Shame I didn't ask
for his number.

15:46.350 --> 15:47.967
Well, now you can get
your second chance.

15:47.969 --> 15:49.218
Where are we going?

15:49.220 --> 15:50.436
We're going
to pick him up.

15:50.438 --> 15:51.771
With what probable cause?

15:51.773 --> 15:53.589
None.
Danny...

15:53.591 --> 15:55.424
He never answered the
harassment summons.

15:55.426 --> 15:57.727
Well, that's against the law.

15:57.729 --> 15:59.612
Yes, it is.

16:17.914 --> 16:20.466
BAEZ: Muslims aren't supposed
to smoke.

16:20.468 --> 16:22.835
Maybe he doesn't inhale
while he works.

16:22.837 --> 16:24.720
Oh.

16:27.123 --> 16:28.174
DANNY:
Excuse me.

16:28.176 --> 16:30.309
We're looking
for Mustafa Haddad.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.011
He's not here.

16:32.013 --> 16:33.395
Oh, really?

16:33.397 --> 16:35.898
Yeah, he, uh... just left.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.233
Oh, really?

16:37.235 --> 16:39.151
He just left.

16:39.153 --> 16:41.353
Okay, thanks.

16:41.355 --> 16:43.522
(quietly): Why don't you take a walk
and meet me

16:43.524 --> 16:44.907
around the back alley, okay?

16:44.909 --> 16:46.475
I'm gonna use the restroom.

16:50.781 --> 16:53.282
(door creaks loudly)
MAN: I said he's not here.

16:53.284 --> 16:54.983
He just left.

16:54.985 --> 16:57.169
(door shuts)

17:02.709 --> 17:03.843
Hold it!

17:03.845 --> 17:05.377
(woman screams)

17:06.463 --> 17:08.681
Police! Don't move!

17:08.683 --> 17:10.348
Come here.

17:10.351 --> 17:11.934
(grunting)

17:12.803 --> 17:14.019
Turn over.

17:14.021 --> 17:16.188
Turn over!

17:16.190 --> 17:18.390
To answer your question
from earlier,

17:18.392 --> 17:20.859
yeah, you're under arrest.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.167
Where were you the night
of Kathleen D'Amato's murder?

17:38.971 --> 17:40.955
Come on, Mustafa.

17:40.957 --> 17:43.691
I even kept my, uh,
partner outside

17:43.693 --> 17:46.160
as a sign of respect
to you and your beliefs.

17:46.162 --> 17:47.578
So why don't you relax,

17:47.580 --> 17:49.831
and we'll have a little
conversation, you and I, okay?

17:49.833 --> 17:51.866
I have nothing
to say to you, either.

17:51.868 --> 17:54.385
You had a lot
to say the other day.

17:54.387 --> 17:57.588
You remember when you called
the victim of a murder a whore?

17:57.590 --> 17:59.540
Do you have any idea

17:59.542 --> 18:02.477
how a jury reacts
to a comment like that?

18:02.479 --> 18:04.095
It is the truth.

18:04.097 --> 18:05.847
Why? Because she loved
your brother?

18:05.849 --> 18:07.982
Because she is not one of us.

18:07.984 --> 18:10.151
You do not date

18:10.153 --> 18:12.103
outside of your kind.
Or...

18:12.105 --> 18:15.072
Mustafa will put
an end to it, huh?

18:15.074 --> 18:16.991
She was tempting my brother.

18:16.993 --> 18:20.528
Leading him away
from the teachings of Allah.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.163
So you did Allah's work,
is that it?

18:22.165 --> 18:24.866
Hmm?

18:24.868 --> 18:27.251
Now would be a great time
for you to take credit

18:27.253 --> 18:28.953
for the good deed you've done.

18:29.788 --> 18:31.923
I didn't kill her.

18:33.842 --> 18:36.043
I was with the Imam
studying the Koran.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.011
Ask him.

18:37.013 --> 18:39.013
I'll ask him.

18:39.015 --> 18:41.265
But why didn't you just say that
from the beginning?

18:41.267 --> 18:43.601
Why should I?

18:43.603 --> 18:45.470
What have I done
to deserve this,

18:45.472 --> 18:47.054
other than being Muslim?

18:47.923 --> 18:49.307
Well...

18:49.309 --> 18:52.393
you called the victim
of a homicide a whore,

18:52.395 --> 18:55.429
a woman that your own brother
cared deeply about.

18:55.431 --> 18:57.782
You've been scooped up
a half dozen times

18:57.784 --> 18:59.984
in front of your own mosque
for harassing women

18:59.986 --> 19:01.319
for the clothes that they wear.

19:01.321 --> 19:03.621
And you are harassing me
for my religion.

19:03.623 --> 19:04.989
No.

19:04.991 --> 19:07.041
I'll scoop up any scumbag
who commits a crime.

19:07.043 --> 19:09.327
I don't give a rat's ass
what their faith is.

19:09.329 --> 19:11.562
And whether you
think so or not,

19:11.564 --> 19:15.833
Mustafa, I would do
the same for you.

19:21.957 --> 19:23.591
How about
catching the guys

19:23.593 --> 19:25.960
that did this after 9/11?

19:29.248 --> 19:32.299
I was just walking
down the street,

19:32.301 --> 19:35.486
and they saw my prayer cap.

19:37.606 --> 19:41.826
They called me a camel jockey
and said it was my fault.

19:43.912 --> 19:47.081
I was 12 years old.

19:52.955 --> 19:56.424
How about you find them?

19:57.342 --> 19:59.844
Right now I'm trying
to find a killer.

19:59.846 --> 20:02.179
You can decide whether or not
you want to help me

20:02.181 --> 20:04.515
while I go check out
your alibi, okay?

20:10.439 --> 20:13.608
I'm sorry that happened to you.

20:17.613 --> 20:20.314
RENZULLI: Flu shots will be available
in the half hour

20:20.316 --> 20:22.650
before and after every tour
today and tomorrow.

20:22.652 --> 20:26.153
Consider it mandatory, okay?

20:27.656 --> 20:29.657
Ten-hut!

20:31.243 --> 20:33.578
Commissioner.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.079
As you were.

20:37.549 --> 20:40.301
We have a possible

20:40.303 --> 20:42.587
regarding Pedro Mendoza,

20:42.589 --> 20:45.139
the former NYPD officer

20:45.141 --> 20:47.058
who is wanted for the murder

20:47.060 --> 20:50.878
of a Miami police officer
and the wounding of another.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.598
Just over an hour ago,

20:53.600 --> 20:56.817
a male fitting
his description was involved

20:56.819 --> 20:59.654
in a shooting incident
with police

20:59.656 --> 21:02.273
at the Philadelphia
Amtrak station.

21:02.275 --> 21:04.859
The details are fluid,

21:04.861 --> 21:06.694
but he is in the wind,

21:06.696 --> 21:10.197
and we don't have a fix
on where he's headed.

21:10.199 --> 21:12.833
His photo and description
are being distributed

21:12.835 --> 21:15.503
at all precincts as we speak.

21:18.406 --> 21:20.791
But I am here...

21:20.793 --> 21:22.960
at the 12th.

21:24.179 --> 21:26.380
From the profile
we put together,

21:26.382 --> 21:28.966
there is evidence to suggest

21:28.968 --> 21:32.386
that Mr. Mendoza
may have an agenda.

21:32.388 --> 21:36.607
Taking his revenge on the cops
he blames for his situation.

21:37.976 --> 21:41.812
While we have no hard evidence
he is headed here,

21:41.814 --> 21:44.398
or even to our city...

21:44.400 --> 21:46.984
he was terminated
at this precinct.

21:48.570 --> 21:51.372
And some of you had a hand
in the evaluations

21:51.374 --> 21:53.607
that led to his dismissal.

21:54.793 --> 21:58.045
And while the termination
was righteous,

21:58.047 --> 22:01.582
this former detective's
instinct...

22:01.584 --> 22:05.336
is to err on the side
of caution here.

22:05.338 --> 22:07.555
Double the plainclothes tours.

22:07.557 --> 22:11.592
Double the respondents
to all critical code dispatches.

22:11.594 --> 22:13.978
Every sergeant
who turns you out

22:13.980 --> 22:16.180
will be checking
for bulletproof vests.

22:16.182 --> 22:17.464
Every plainclothes

22:17.466 --> 22:19.684
with the color of the day

22:19.686 --> 22:21.969
on full display.

22:29.578 --> 22:31.996
Think of today

22:31.998 --> 22:35.750
as each alley
is a little darker,

22:35.752 --> 22:39.370
and every routine call...

22:39.372 --> 22:42.540
may not be routine at all.

22:42.542 --> 22:47.261
This is exactly
the kind of day...

22:47.263 --> 22:49.547
you were trained for.

22:50.549 --> 22:52.550
Godspeed.

22:52.552 --> 22:55.269
Ten-hut.

22:56.138 --> 22:57.671
At ease.

23:03.662 --> 23:06.030
So she was strangled
and her neck was fractured,

23:06.032 --> 23:08.115
but that's not what killed her.

23:08.117 --> 23:09.817
The bruising here is consistent

23:09.819 --> 23:11.952
with someone grabbing her
from behind

23:11.954 --> 23:13.487
so that her neck was wedged

23:13.489 --> 23:15.206
between the assailant's bicep
and forearm,

23:15.208 --> 23:16.540
cutting off the blood flow.

23:16.542 --> 23:18.826
She probably
fractured her vertebrae

23:18.828 --> 23:20.244
struggling to get away.

23:20.246 --> 23:22.362
So he put her in a sleeper hold?

23:22.364 --> 23:24.715
You can die in a matter of
seconds if it's held too long.

23:24.717 --> 23:26.300
Right, which is why
police departments

23:26.302 --> 23:28.002
across the country
stopped using it.

23:28.004 --> 23:30.337
Exactly. We get
quite a few accidental

23:30.339 --> 23:31.872
civilian deaths on this.
I bet.

23:31.874 --> 23:33.040
Kids pick it up

23:33.042 --> 23:35.542
watching the MMA,
or off the Internet.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.194
And I found this.

23:37.196 --> 23:39.146
It's a henna tattoo.

23:39.148 --> 23:41.599
DANNY and TRENT:
"Islam Mashallah."

23:41.601 --> 23:44.268
It connotes joyous amazement.

23:44.270 --> 23:46.854
Girls get tattoos for guys.

23:46.856 --> 23:49.056
Maybe she liked Salem
more than he knew.

23:49.058 --> 23:51.776
Oh, I bet that tattoo
might have made Salem happy,

23:51.778 --> 23:55.562
but I can also think of somebody
that it would have pissed off.

24:00.418 --> 24:01.836
Mustafa Haddad
was with the Imam,

24:01.838 --> 24:03.087
just like he said.

24:03.089 --> 24:04.755
Figured as much. Moving on.

24:04.757 --> 24:06.090
Vic's yearbook?

24:06.092 --> 24:07.908
Yeah. Kathleen was
the homecoming queen.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.260
And where there's a queen,

24:09.262 --> 24:10.678
there's usually a king.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.096
Joe Ferraro.

24:12.098 --> 24:14.298
D'Amato said Ferraro
was like a son to him.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.415
That's right.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.184
But maybe he meant
more like a son-in-law.

24:17.186 --> 24:19.253
Look at this.
"Kathleen, you and me forever.

24:19.255 --> 24:20.721
I'll never let you go. Joe."

24:20.723 --> 24:23.107
Under different circumstances,
that might be romantic.

24:23.109 --> 24:24.308
Yeah?

24:24.310 --> 24:26.426
Well, now  where
it gets real creepy.

24:26.428 --> 24:29.647
Joe was the captain
of the wrestling team.

24:29.649 --> 24:31.866
I bet he knows
a sleeper hold.

24:31.868 --> 24:33.617
Exactly. Let's find out

24:33.619 --> 24:34.735
where this guy lives

24:34.737 --> 24:37.604
and go pay him a visit.

24:42.744 --> 24:44.712
It's Ferraro's vehicle.

24:44.714 --> 24:47.081
Yeah. It's packed up
like he's taking a trip.

24:48.316 --> 24:52.169
Hey, you going
somewhere?

24:52.171 --> 24:54.138
Don't even
think about it.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.140
What do you want?

24:56.142 --> 24:57.892
I didn't do nothing.

24:57.894 --> 24:59.760
That works for me.

24:59.762 --> 25:01.729
Yeah. You know, when
guys, uh, say that

25:01.731 --> 25:03.347
before we even ask
them a question,

25:03.349 --> 25:04.732
typically means
they did something.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.634
Look, we just want to ask you
a couple of questions

25:07.636 --> 25:09.469
about the murder
of Kathleen D'Amato.

25:10.972 --> 25:13.007
This is bull, okay?

25:13.009 --> 25:14.158
Hey! Hey!

25:14.160 --> 25:15.576
Come on, hands
against the car.

25:15.578 --> 25:17.578
Get your hands against the car.
All right, look, no!

25:17.580 --> 25:19.359
You should be arresting one
of those Muslim bastards!

25:19.384 --> 25:20.832
Get your hands up!

25:20.833 --> 25:23.284
Get your hands up
against the vehicle.

25:31.659 --> 25:32.860
Man, it's like...

25:32.862 --> 25:35.346
it's like every fifth guy
fits the description.

25:35.348 --> 25:37.047
No kidding. I feel
like I'm eyeballing

25:37.049 --> 25:38.299
for one of my cousins.

25:38.301 --> 25:40.100
Yeah. Hey, look,
you want a coffee?

25:40.102 --> 25:43.003
Oh, no, thank you, man.
I'm... I'm jumpy as it is.

25:53.348 --> 25:55.199
MAN:
Pedro Mendoza, police!

25:58.587 --> 25:59.570
Hey, Vinny.

25:59.572 --> 26:00.520
Colors.

26:00.522 --> 26:02.156
Vinny.
Hey, Vinny, colors.

26:02.158 --> 26:03.374
Vinny, colors! Hey

26:03.376 --> 26:05.242
Vinny, colors.
Hey! Hey!

26:05.244 --> 26:07.294
Don't move!
Hey, we're on the job! We're on the job!

26:07.296 --> 26:09.029
We're on the job.

26:09.031 --> 26:11.065
We're plainclothes.
Where are you from?

26:11.067 --> 26:12.633
The 2-7.
2-7.

26:12.635 --> 26:14.668
You should not be
in plainclothes!

26:14.670 --> 26:16.536
You need to get
your freaking eyes checked!

26:17.973 --> 26:20.540
Is that me?

26:20.542 --> 26:22.309
From 20 yards, yeah.

26:22.311 --> 26:23.894
We're out of the 12th.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.346
Just calm down,
guys, all right?

26:25.348 --> 26:27.381
Sorry.
I get it. I get it.

26:27.383 --> 26:29.233
I'm sorry.
All good, brother.

26:29.235 --> 26:31.485
We need to get this guy.
This is insane.

26:43.179 --> 26:45.597
So you saw Kathleen
the night she was killed?

26:45.599 --> 26:46.898
Yeah.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.200
You didn't think
to mention that?

26:48.202 --> 26:50.268
Hmm?

26:50.270 --> 26:52.037
You know, Joe,

26:52.039 --> 26:54.206
you're either really stupid
or really guilty.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.457
Or maybe both.

26:55.459 --> 26:58.193
I didn't kill Kathleen.

26:59.529 --> 27:01.029
What did you two talk about
that night?

27:01.031 --> 27:02.964
Everything.

27:02.966 --> 27:06.134
Stuff we used to do
together as kids.

27:06.136 --> 27:08.086
Our plans for the future.

27:08.088 --> 27:09.621
You mean <i>your</i> plans?

27:09.623 --> 27:11.556
They were our plans.

27:11.558 --> 27:13.725
It all changed
after her mom died.

27:13.727 --> 27:17.479
Kathleen just drifted away
from everyone that she knew.

27:17.481 --> 27:18.597
Like you?

27:18.599 --> 27:20.298
Huh?

27:20.300 --> 27:22.567
She drifted away from you,
huh, Joe?

27:22.569 --> 27:23.968
Yeah.

27:23.970 --> 27:25.270
How'd that make you feel?

27:25.272 --> 27:27.805
How the hell do you think?

27:27.807 --> 27:29.807
She became a different person.

27:29.809 --> 27:32.193
It tore Mr. D apart.

27:32.195 --> 27:34.112
DANNY:
Mr. D.

27:34.114 --> 27:37.866
Did, uh, Mr. D, or Vince, know

27:37.868 --> 27:40.118
that you, uh,
were seeing Kathleen that night?

27:41.454 --> 27:43.705
I mean, he wanted you two
back together, right?

27:45.341 --> 27:47.492
Had the wedding planned out.

27:47.494 --> 27:49.628
Practically had
our kids baptized.

27:51.797 --> 27:54.215
I asked Kathleen
to meet me at Skully's

27:54.217 --> 27:55.550
to set things straight.

27:55.552 --> 27:58.670
I knew something was up when
she ordered a damn ice tea.

27:58.672 --> 28:00.689
What's so strange about that?

28:00.691 --> 28:02.057
Just wasn't normal.

28:02.059 --> 28:04.142
I asked her why she
wouldn't have a beer

28:04.144 --> 28:05.393
with me like
she used to.

28:05.395 --> 28:08.012
Maybe she just
didn't feel like it.

28:08.014 --> 28:09.180
No, that wasn't it.

28:09.182 --> 28:10.348
So, what was it?

28:10.350 --> 28:12.150
(sighs)

28:12.152 --> 28:14.235
Hey, what was it, Joe?

28:15.354 --> 28:18.523
Why wouldn't Kathleen
drink alcohol?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.877
Because she became a Muslim,

28:22.879 --> 28:25.463
and it was
against the rules.

28:25.465 --> 28:27.465
Kathleen converted to Islam?

28:27.467 --> 28:29.718
Muslims call it "reverted."

28:29.720 --> 28:31.553
That's what she said
they called it.

28:31.555 --> 28:33.471
So you wanted
to have a family with Kathleen,

28:33.473 --> 28:34.806
but you knew there was no way

28:34.808 --> 28:36.257
you were gonna raise
your kids Muslim,

28:36.259 --> 28:38.059
and that gave you no chance
with her,

28:38.061 --> 28:39.210
and that made you emotional,

28:39.212 --> 28:40.712
and you went
a little ballistic, huh?

28:40.714 --> 28:42.380
Yeah, you're damn right.

28:42.382 --> 28:43.881
We got in a big fight.

28:43.883 --> 28:45.400
But she ran out.

28:45.402 --> 28:46.818
And you just let her go?

28:46.820 --> 28:48.653
What was I supposed to do?

28:49.522 --> 28:51.489
Were you at the bar all night?

28:51.491 --> 28:54.693
I went out to smoke
a couple cigarettes.

28:54.695 --> 28:56.894
Beside that,

28:56.896 --> 28:59.280
yeah.

28:59.282 --> 29:01.700
Joe, did you call Vince and cry
on his shoulder that night?

29:01.702 --> 29:03.785
(sighs)

29:05.287 --> 29:08.340
I'm not answering any more
questions until I get a lawyer.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.604
He's hiding something.

29:22.606 --> 29:23.938
You think?

29:23.940 --> 29:26.191
And how does Kathleen convert
without somebody knowing?

29:26.193 --> 29:27.425
It's different for Muslims.

29:27.427 --> 29:29.277
They read the Koran,
they take a cleansing shower,

29:29.279 --> 29:31.062
they say a few prayers,
and they're in.

29:32.365 --> 29:34.115
Two tours in Fallujah.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.234
Let's check this kid's
alibi out, all right?

29:40.623 --> 29:42.707
JACK:
Pork roast.

29:42.709 --> 29:44.342
My favorite.
Mine, too.

29:44.344 --> 29:45.777
Everything's
your favorite.

29:46.662 --> 29:47.829
Sorry I'm late, gang.

29:47.831 --> 29:49.464
Dad.

29:49.466 --> 29:50.498
Hey, how goes the case?

29:50.500 --> 29:52.167
Chasing
our tails.

29:52.169 --> 29:53.785
LINDA: You know, it's been
a hell of a week.

29:53.787 --> 29:55.387
Why don't we just
leave business at the office?

29:55.389 --> 29:56.721
Sounds good to me.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.978
Somehow, I don't think
Linda meant

30:03.980 --> 30:05.129
we take a vow of silence.

30:05.131 --> 30:06.431
(chuckles)
NICKY: Can I ask one

30:06.433 --> 30:07.515
work-related question?

30:07.517 --> 30:09.267
That girl they found

30:09.269 --> 30:11.019
in the cemetery--
I read she was murdered

30:11.021 --> 30:13.071
because she converted to Islam.
Is that true?

30:13.073 --> 30:15.023
DANNY:
Well, we got a

30:15.025 --> 30:16.991
bigoted ex-boyfriend
and a blossoming relationship

30:16.993 --> 30:18.443
between her and a Muslim guy,

30:18.445 --> 30:19.644
but that's all we got.

30:19.646 --> 30:21.079
HENRY:
In my experience,

30:21.081 --> 30:24.032
interfaith relationships
almost always cause problems.

30:24.034 --> 30:25.316
SEAN:
I thought Great-Grandma

30:25.318 --> 30:26.501
was Catholic.

30:26.503 --> 30:28.086
(laughs)

30:28.088 --> 30:30.755
I didn't mean
my personal experience.

30:30.757 --> 30:32.624
Though she never
forgave the Vatican

30:32.626 --> 30:34.509
for taking Latin from the Mass.

30:34.511 --> 30:35.993
I say you can't help
who you fall in love with.

30:35.995 --> 30:37.212
Hmm.
ERIN: Is there something

30:37.214 --> 30:39.047
I need to know?
(Henry laughs)

30:39.049 --> 30:40.882
FRANK: Unfortunately,
not everyone

30:40.884 --> 30:42.467
is as tolerant
as you are, Nicky.

30:42.469 --> 30:44.436
It shouldn't be
anybody else's business.

30:44.438 --> 30:45.503
ERIN:
True...

30:45.505 --> 30:46.638
in a perfect world,

30:46.640 --> 30:48.022
which is not what we have.

30:48.024 --> 30:49.674
Raises a lot
of questions, Nicky.

30:49.676 --> 30:50.642
How do you raise the kids?

30:50.644 --> 30:52.176
Who gives in?

30:52.178 --> 30:53.862
Better work that stuff out
before you tie the knot.

30:53.864 --> 30:55.012
Make a compromise.

30:55.014 --> 30:56.614
Yeah, but the definition
of a good compromise

30:56.616 --> 30:57.816
is when neither side is happy.

30:57.818 --> 30:59.350
Sounds like a normal
marriage to me.

30:59.352 --> 31:00.318
(laughter)

31:00.320 --> 31:01.519
LINDA:
Hmm.

31:01.521 --> 31:03.020
Since when have you ever had

31:03.022 --> 31:04.489
to compromise on anything?

31:04.491 --> 31:06.741
Grandpa,
what would you have done

31:06.743 --> 31:08.576
she was marrying,
say, a Muslim guy?

31:08.578 --> 31:10.995
Okay, now you're just
trying to cause problems.

31:10.997 --> 31:12.831
Actually, I'd kind of like
to hear this one.

31:12.833 --> 31:14.365
Mm-hmm. I'd like
to hear it, too.

31:16.585 --> 31:20.204
You want my initial knee-jerk
Irish-Catholic response?

31:20.206 --> 31:22.257
Kick the guy's butt
on down the road.

31:22.259 --> 31:23.975
Yeah, or mine.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.977
(Henry chuckles)

31:25.979 --> 31:28.012
On my good days,
when I'm thinking right,

31:28.014 --> 31:30.815
hopefully, it's about <i>who</i> he is.

31:30.817 --> 31:32.984
And how he treats my daughter.

31:32.986 --> 31:34.519
DANNY:
Mmm.

31:34.521 --> 31:35.687
Well, I want to be Jewish.

31:35.689 --> 31:37.054
You what?
JAMIE: What?

31:37.056 --> 31:38.439
What?

31:38.441 --> 31:40.658
ERIN: What?
Come again?

31:40.660 --> 31:42.059
Well, I've been
to three Bar Mitzvahs this year.

31:42.061 --> 31:43.244
Uh-huh.
And they're all

31:43.246 --> 31:44.612
crazy fun, and

31:44.614 --> 31:46.748
they get to clean up
in the gift department.

31:46.750 --> 31:47.999
Oh. That's a great reason.

31:48.001 --> 31:49.501
LINDA:
Mm-hmm. Okay.

31:49.503 --> 31:52.337
That's fine, but you're gonna
have to go to Hebrew school.

31:52.339 --> 31:53.454
JAMIE:
Yeah, and you might have

31:53.456 --> 31:54.706
to give up
on Christmas presents.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.007
Not to mention bacon.

31:56.009 --> 31:57.292
Really?

31:57.294 --> 32:00.762
Bacon...
the ultimate test of faith.

32:02.097 --> 32:04.265
(laughter)

32:07.853 --> 32:09.888
Did you speak
to the bartender?

32:09.890 --> 32:11.773
BAEZ:
He confirmed he was there.

32:11.775 --> 32:13.975
He went in and out
a couple of times,

32:13.977 --> 32:16.361
but he, uh... he was still
at the bar for last call.

32:16.363 --> 32:18.229
So, in other words,
we got squat.

32:18.231 --> 32:19.397
(Danny slams bowl on table)

32:19.399 --> 32:21.065
Yeah, fine.
I'll meet you at the house.

32:21.067 --> 32:22.233
All right.

32:22.235 --> 32:23.535
Sorry, kid.

32:23.537 --> 32:25.153
You're gonna have to finish
the dishes on your own.

32:25.155 --> 32:26.270
I got to go.

32:26.272 --> 32:27.455
Funny how you're
always on a hot case

32:27.457 --> 32:28.740
when it come to
doing the dishes.

32:28.742 --> 32:30.542
Well, you know,
maybe you can pull

32:30.544 --> 32:32.109
the same scam one day yourself.

32:32.111 --> 32:33.611
After you get your gold shield.

32:33.613 --> 32:36.214
Forget it.
Bye, Dad.

32:47.626 --> 32:50.228
Anything else you can tell me
about Mendoza, where he is?

32:50.230 --> 32:52.463
You know everything I know.

32:52.465 --> 32:54.682
Dad, that's never the case.

32:58.988 --> 33:01.356
You got a specific question?

33:01.358 --> 33:04.692
Any more evidence
that the 12th is a target?

33:05.744 --> 33:08.580
No more or less than I
had in the muster room.

33:09.782 --> 33:12.617
But you know about the incident
with me and Vinny.

33:14.653 --> 33:16.421
Yes, I do.

33:16.423 --> 33:19.374
It's not the only one.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.594
I know that, too.

33:23.495 --> 33:25.830
I hate the not knowing.

33:25.832 --> 33:28.016
(quiet sigh)

33:28.018 --> 33:30.051
It's the one part of the job

33:30.053 --> 33:32.804
that you can't put
a pay grade on,

33:32.806 --> 33:37.025
and there's nothing for it
but the awful waiting.

33:37.027 --> 33:39.811
♪

33:52.759 --> 33:55.227
There were no calls
from Joe Ferraro's mobile

33:55.229 --> 33:58.263
to or from anyone
in the relevant time frame.

33:58.265 --> 33:59.714
Which means he didn't tell Vince

33:59.716 --> 34:02.100
about Kathleen's conversion
before her death.

34:02.102 --> 34:03.935
So there goes motive for Vince.

34:03.937 --> 34:05.770
Unless Kathleen told Vince

34:05.772 --> 34:07.973
about the conversion
to Islam herself.

34:07.975 --> 34:10.242
Look, she knew he
was working late

34:10.244 --> 34:11.409
at the store that night, right?

34:11.411 --> 34:13.295
She also knew
he was having a hard time

34:13.297 --> 34:15.213
figuring out
her accounting system, so...

34:15.215 --> 34:17.833
maybe she went over to the store
to help him and...

34:17.835 --> 34:19.717
just decided
to come clean to him, too.

34:19.719 --> 34:23.138
"Hey, Pop, your little angel
just converted to Islam"?

34:23.139 --> 34:25.674
Would he really
kill his kid over that?

34:25.676 --> 34:27.425
Look, I know Catholics
aren't exactly known

34:27.427 --> 34:29.010
for honor killings,
but think about it.

34:29.012 --> 34:30.846
When his wife died,
his world crumbled, right?

34:30.848 --> 34:32.731
And now his daughter's
gonna turn her back

34:32.733 --> 34:35.817
on the only thing he has left to
hold on to, his Catholic faith?

34:35.819 --> 34:37.068
I mean, it's
possible.

34:37.070 --> 34:40.155
Even if you're right,
we got no hard evidence.

34:40.157 --> 34:41.739
We can't make the case.

34:41.742 --> 34:43.358
No, we <i>can</i> make the case--

34:43.360 --> 34:47.245
if we can get Vince D'Amato
to confess to his sins.

34:47.246 --> 34:50.031
WOMAN (over radio): All units confined
to 12th Precinct,

34:50.033 --> 34:52.701
off-duty officer reports
suspect matching description

34:52.703 --> 34:55.453
Miami shooting suspect
Pedro Mendoza

34:55.455 --> 34:59.090
entering storage facility
at 8090 Broadway.

34:59.092 --> 35:01.760
Requesting 10-85 forthwith.

35:01.762 --> 35:03.378
Kill lights and sirens.

35:03.380 --> 35:05.630
Central, is that confirmed
by the officer?

35:05.632 --> 35:07.382
That is confirmed.

35:07.384 --> 35:09.634
Is Sergeant Renzulli
on the air?

35:09.636 --> 35:12.304
12th Sergeant Renzulli
is en route to location.

35:12.306 --> 35:13.671
Ten-four.

35:25.618 --> 35:28.186
Reagan and Cruz, we got
the corner covered going east.

35:28.188 --> 35:30.288
If he turns west,
he's headed your way.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.541
Copy that. Looking for jeans,
baseball jacket

35:32.543 --> 35:34.025
and tan work boots.

35:34.027 --> 35:36.694
Affirmative. All right,
let's go. Come on.

35:36.696 --> 35:37.929
Three guys.

35:37.931 --> 35:40.549
Hey, we got three guys out
there, all wearing colors.

35:40.551 --> 35:41.833
Find your best angle

35:41.835 --> 35:43.718
on that storage facility
door, all right?

35:49.759 --> 35:51.760
I'm praying this is him.

35:51.762 --> 35:53.711
I want this over with.

35:53.713 --> 35:56.064
Yeah, you and me both, brother.

35:56.933 --> 35:59.217
RENZULLI:
Is that him? Is that him?

35:59.219 --> 36:00.769
I don't know.
I can't see his face.

36:00.771 --> 36:02.687
He wasn't wearing
a freaking hoodie.

36:02.689 --> 36:05.190
He's got tan boots and jeans--
he could've changed his jacket.

36:05.192 --> 36:07.075
We need a positive I.D.
on this guy.

36:07.944 --> 36:09.861
I'm going on foot.

36:19.589 --> 36:21.206
I'm on the move.

36:21.208 --> 36:22.791
Copy that.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.801
That's our boy.

36:32.803 --> 36:34.752
Take him!

36:36.222 --> 36:37.856
Mendoza!

36:45.064 --> 36:46.982
Show us your hands!
You bitch!

36:54.640 --> 36:56.107
Suspect is down!

36:56.109 --> 36:57.776
Repeat, suspect is down!

37:08.888 --> 37:11.456
(panting):
Now it's over.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.821
Mr. D'Amato! Hey.

37:26.823 --> 37:28.323
Detectives.

37:28.325 --> 37:30.158
Come on in.

37:33.579 --> 37:35.580
(sighs)
You found anything?

37:35.582 --> 37:37.999
Uh, as a matter
of fact, yeah,

37:38.001 --> 37:40.118
I believe
we found our guy.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.536
You did?

37:41.538 --> 37:43.838
It was Joe Ferraro.

37:44.874 --> 37:47.258
(exhales)
That's not possible.

37:47.260 --> 37:51.179
(stammers)
You just let him go.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.630
Yeah, we did let him go,

37:52.632 --> 37:54.549
but then we found
some of his DNA

37:54.551 --> 37:55.850
underneath Kathleen's
fingernails

37:55.852 --> 37:57.519
and... we sent a car

37:57.521 --> 37:59.304
to pick him up.
No, no, no,

37:59.306 --> 38:01.339
no, no, no.
Joe wouldn't do that.

38:01.341 --> 38:02.841
Really?
Yeah.

38:03.809 --> 38:06.478
I mean, look, they...
they had a fight earlier.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.446
Maybe she scratched him.

38:08.448 --> 38:10.448
Who told you they had a fight?

38:10.450 --> 38:11.649
Joe.

38:11.651 --> 38:12.984
Joe did.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.352
That's funny.

38:14.354 --> 38:15.820
We checked his
phone records.

38:15.822 --> 38:17.706
He never called you
after any fight.

38:17.708 --> 38:20.742
Maybe it was later--
I don't know exactly when.

38:20.744 --> 38:24.195
Did Joe also tell you that
your daughter Kathleen

38:24.197 --> 38:25.880
had converted to Islam?

38:25.882 --> 38:27.665
DANNY: Your sweet little
Catholic girl

38:27.667 --> 38:30.585
went all Muslim?

38:30.587 --> 38:32.203
No.

38:32.205 --> 38:35.924
My Kathleen...
was a good Catholic girl.

38:35.926 --> 38:37.492
But she converted.

38:37.494 --> 38:38.893
She... well, she was confused.

38:38.895 --> 38:40.311
She didn't know what she wanted.

38:40.313 --> 38:41.642
How do you know
she was confused?

38:41.667 --> 38:43.182
She told me.

38:43.183 --> 38:45.550
DANNY: But she didn't
tell you she was confused.

38:45.552 --> 38:47.485
She told you that
she converted

38:47.487 --> 38:49.320
to Islam and she
wasn't coming back

38:49.322 --> 38:51.272
to the Catholic Church.
No.

38:51.274 --> 38:53.691
That's right, she came over
here after she met with Joe,

38:53.693 --> 38:55.360
she came to help you
with the systems,

38:55.362 --> 38:57.746
and she confided in you, her father,
Yes!

38:57.748 --> 38:59.748
Yes, she did!
that she converted to Islam!

38:59.750 --> 39:01.199
Yes! Okay?

39:01.201 --> 39:02.667
Yeah.

39:09.842 --> 39:12.043
So, you want
to tell us

39:12.045 --> 39:14.629
how it happened, Mr. D'Amato?

39:16.065 --> 39:18.550
(long sigh)

39:18.552 --> 39:21.252
Kathleen was my whole world.

39:21.254 --> 39:24.439
She was all
I had left.

39:24.441 --> 39:27.976
When she told me
that she converted to Islam...

39:27.978 --> 39:30.261
She met this guy.

39:30.263 --> 39:33.064
I... I laughed;
I thought she was joking.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.484
Then she ripped off her crucifix
and threw it on the floor.

39:36.486 --> 39:39.103
Her mother gave her
that cross.

39:39.105 --> 39:41.539
Her mother.

39:41.541 --> 39:43.541
What did you do?

39:44.376 --> 39:46.461
She told me that...

39:46.463 --> 39:49.113
I'd never see her again...

39:49.115 --> 39:51.949
if I didn't accept her decision.

39:51.951 --> 39:55.470
Then she turned her back on me,
so... I grabbed her,

39:55.472 --> 39:57.922
tight.

39:57.924 --> 39:59.924
I didn't want her to go.

39:59.926 --> 40:02.010
Yeah, but she wanted to leave.

40:02.012 --> 40:04.679
So you held her
a little tighter, didn't you?

40:04.681 --> 40:06.431
Yeah.

40:06.433 --> 40:08.233
And then you squeezed her
so tight

40:08.235 --> 40:10.602
that she lost consciousness
and stopped breathing.

40:10.604 --> 40:13.655
Isn't that right,
Mr. D'Amato?

40:13.657 --> 40:16.291
She, uh... she went to sleep.

40:16.293 --> 40:17.575
No.

40:17.577 --> 40:20.478
She didn't;
she died.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.280
And you dragged her body
to the cemetery.

40:22.282 --> 40:23.581
(panting)

40:23.583 --> 40:26.918
I put her...
where she'd be safe,

40:26.920 --> 40:28.920
under God's eyes.

40:28.922 --> 40:32.090
Then I put the crucifix
in her hand.

40:35.845 --> 40:38.546
She was a good Catholic girl.

40:38.548 --> 40:40.465
Yeah.

40:40.467 --> 40:42.500
"Was" being the operative word.

40:42.502 --> 40:43.852
Get on your feet,

40:43.854 --> 40:45.336
Mr. D'Amato.

40:45.338 --> 40:46.804
Come on.

40:53.062 --> 40:54.445
(door opens)

40:54.447 --> 40:55.797
BAKER:
Sir?

40:55.799 --> 40:57.315
Good night, Baker.

40:57.317 --> 40:58.816
Anything before I go?

40:58.818 --> 41:01.369
No. You have a good evening.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.854
Do you want some dinner sent up?

41:04.907 --> 41:07.125
I'll get something at home.

41:07.127 --> 41:09.327
What should I tell your detail?

41:10.946 --> 41:12.614
(sighs quietly)

41:12.616 --> 41:15.333
