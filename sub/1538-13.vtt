WEBVTT

00:20.954 --> 00:22.454
Paul:
Yeah, you want to put it up

00:22.456 --> 00:24.123
A couple of inches
on your side, love.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.025
Okeydokey.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.128
You really think

00:29.130 --> 00:32.631
Anyone's gonna pay to see
this rich nancy sing show tunes?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.299
I wouldn't.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.135
He gives me the creeps.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.137
He keeps wanting
to spoon-feed me,

00:38.139 --> 00:40.806
And then making
these weird airplane noises.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.909
We should just leave,
all of us, join a new show.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.078
Penny, do you really think

00:46.080 --> 00:48.313
If there wasn't another option,
some other freak show out there,

00:48.315 --> 00:49.581
I wouldn't take you away

00:49.583 --> 00:51.417
In an instant?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.085
There's nowhere to go.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.087
Our world is dying,
sweetheart.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.890
This is the end
of the line.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.593
But we've got to eat,

01:01.595 --> 01:04.763
And that kid's got money
pouring out of his ears.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.598
I say we let him
keep feeding us

01:06.600 --> 01:08.333
Until that lemon
runs out of juice.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.436
Dandy:
<i>No, no, no!</i>

01:10.438 --> 01:12.037
Turn it off!

01:12.039 --> 01:13.505
I told you
a million trillion times,

01:13.507 --> 01:14.673
The blue light

01:14.675 --> 01:16.108
Is for "night and day."

01:16.110 --> 01:18.243
Blue symbolizes night.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.846
For "anything goes,"

01:20.848 --> 01:22.681
I need the magenta light

01:22.683 --> 01:25.284
To accentuate
my spirited rendition.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.685
(groans)

01:26.687 --> 01:28.020
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.291
Ah, flipper boy!

01:32.293 --> 01:34.126
You're back.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.628
Did you hang the banner
in clear view for all to see?

01:36.630 --> 01:38.030
Yes, sir, just as instructed.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.298
Good, good.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.699
How many tickets have we sold?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.802
Um, well,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.904
As of this time, none...

01:45.906 --> 01:48.207
Quite yet.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.908
You haven't sold
a single ticket?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.376
Well, we only put
out the banner

01:51.378 --> 01:53.212
Half an hour ago.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.380
The town hasn't gotten wind
of your new act.

01:55.382 --> 01:58.117
I don't understand.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.386
You must have done
something wrong.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.921
Sir, this is quite
typical.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.389
You haven't got
a lot of experience

02:04.391 --> 02:05.724
In this sort of thing,
but you'll see.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.827
You think you're so smart.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.497
You don't know anything,
you stupid freak.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.831
He's only trying to help.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.968
Oh, shut up, you ugly cow.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.503
No one cares

02:17.505 --> 02:19.238
What you think,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.240
Any of you.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.910
I'm in charge here,
and I say it's your fault.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.578
Obviously,

02:26.580 --> 02:28.580
No one's coming to the show

02:28.582 --> 02:30.916
Because you are boring.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.417
The town has had their fill

02:32.419 --> 02:33.752
Of your mediocre

02:33.754 --> 02:36.588
Oddities.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.756
The thrill is gone.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.125
You're yesterday's news.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.094
Audiences want

02:42.096 --> 02:44.930
A new type of freak.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.999
Something different.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.770
Maybe I need to give you all
some new, startling look.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.274
I think a pair of horns

02:55.276 --> 02:56.942
Would be quite
attractive on you.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.443
Don't you touch her.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.112
This is my show!
I'll do whatever I want!

03:00.114 --> 03:01.346
That's is, mister.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.517
(groans)

03:06.953 --> 03:08.620
You hurt me.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.957
I was willing to eat shit
to keep this place going,

03:11.959 --> 03:14.793
But I'd rather starve
than listen to your whiny voice

03:14.795 --> 03:16.528
One more time.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.130
No one wants

03:18.132 --> 03:19.965
To see some pretentious prick

03:19.967 --> 03:21.967
Prancing around on the stage,

03:21.969 --> 03:25.304
And no one gives a shit
about bloody cole porter.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.005
Hey.
You think you're special.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.975
Your mum probably told you
all your life.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.077
Well, I've got news for you.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.079
I've heard you sing,
and you're not special.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.081
You're rubbish.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.749
Even worse,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.318
You're boring.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.586
(laughter)

03:40.588 --> 03:42.754
And we don't trade
in boring.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.824
We're freaks.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.260
You'll never be one of us,

03:48.262 --> 03:50.662
And you don't own us.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.906
We quit.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.031
â™ª

05:37.270 --> 05:39.338
(music playing over p.A.)

05:47.447 --> 05:49.448
(sighs)

05:49.450 --> 05:51.616
Elsa mars

05:51.618 --> 05:53.785
To see mr. Henry v. Gable.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.621
Ms. Mars, mr. Gable
is the president

05:56.623 --> 05:58.457
Of the world
broadcasting network.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.960
He is overseeing over
12 weekly hours of programming,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.462
Not including the news.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.798
He only sees people
by appointment, and today,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.301
Like yesterday
and the day before,

06:09.303 --> 06:11.370
You don't have one.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.907
Look, my darling,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.809
I have some new headshots.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.245
Why don't you leave me
the picture

06:20.247 --> 06:21.580
And a contact number,

06:21.582 --> 06:24.316
And I'll be sure he calls you

06:24.318 --> 06:26.151
As soon as he sees them.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.986
No.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.724
I'll wait.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.687
â™ª

07:20.706 --> 07:22.774
(music switches off)

07:24.043 --> 07:25.577
What is this, huh?

07:25.579 --> 07:27.712
Where is mr. Gable?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.581
I did not see him
pass through.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.882
And I would know him

07:30.884 --> 07:32.751
From his picture in the trades.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.454
He went out the back
to avoid you.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.657
And you let me sit here,

07:38.659 --> 07:41.493
Like a fool, all day?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.495
What kind of a place is this?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.063
Hollywood.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.502
If you ask me,

07:50.504 --> 07:52.003
Change your act.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.805
Marlene did it better.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.577
No!

07:58.579 --> 08:00.078
No!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.246
No!

08:01.248 --> 08:03.415
Let go of me!

08:03.417 --> 08:04.583
Leave her be.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.917
I need to see him!

08:05.919 --> 08:06.751
Leave her be!
No!

08:06.753 --> 08:08.286
What is going on?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.255
This crazy german broad
has been coming in

08:10.257 --> 08:13.258
All week to see mr. Gable
without an appointment.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.327
She finally lost it.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.200
(crying)
what is your name?

08:22.202 --> 08:26.104
My name is elsa mars.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.781
I'm michael beck.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.784
(softly):
Previously michael beckenbauer.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.120
Hollywood's funny
about german surnames.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.623
They are afraid you are a nazi?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.124
Worse.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.293
Communist.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.961
(chuckles)

08:49.963 --> 08:53.798
Mr. Michael beck...

08:53.800 --> 08:57.636
Yours is the first...

08:57.638 --> 09:01.573
Kind face I've seen in months.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.408
What do you do here?

09:03.410 --> 09:05.310
Junior vice president
of casting.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.154
(sighs)

09:30.937 --> 09:33.505
(sighs)

09:33.507 --> 09:35.273
Showtime.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.913
(humming softly)

09:50.456 --> 09:53.024
(continues humming)

10:08.874 --> 10:11.042
We need to talk
about our last week's pay.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.577
(gunshot)

10:12.579 --> 10:14.613
(gasps)

10:16.549 --> 10:17.882
(humming continues)

10:17.884 --> 10:19.884
(panting)

10:19.886 --> 10:21.553
(footsteps approaching)

10:21.555 --> 10:23.955
(humming continues)

10:31.063 --> 10:32.497
(cocking gun)

10:32.499 --> 10:35.166
(gunshot)

10:35.168 --> 10:38.737
(radio playing distantly)

10:44.610 --> 10:47.145
(humming continues)

10:53.786 --> 10:55.620
(popcorn popping)

10:55.622 --> 10:57.288
(radio continues playing)

10:57.290 --> 10:58.823
(gunshot)

10:59.925 --> 11:01.493
(gasps)

11:14.940 --> 11:18.510
(humming continues)

11:32.958 --> 11:34.192
(clang, cries out)

11:36.462 --> 11:38.029
(gunshot)

11:45.638 --> 11:48.306
(sighs)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.375
(humming resumes)

12:03.756 --> 12:05.490
(gunshot)

12:21.841 --> 12:23.074
(gunshots)

12:28.447 --> 12:31.015
(groaning)

12:36.622 --> 12:37.856
(gunshot)

12:54.406 --> 12:55.940
(gunshot)

13:08.220 --> 13:10.288
(door closes)

13:18.564 --> 13:20.398
(footsteps approaching)

13:31.076 --> 13:32.777
(door creaks, bangs on wall)

13:32.779 --> 13:33.978
(quiet gasping)

13:41.754 --> 13:42.987
(yells angrily)

13:51.864 --> 13:52.931
(yells angrily)

14:00.372 --> 14:02.440
(slow footsteps)

14:10.282 --> 14:11.683
(yelling, grunting)

14:39.812 --> 14:41.813
(gunshot)
(whimpers)

14:46.819 --> 14:48.419
Oh...

14:48.421 --> 14:49.988
(sighs heavily)

15:04.169 --> 15:05.737
(door creaks, thuds)

15:13.612 --> 15:15.179
(yells angrily)

15:19.785 --> 15:21.853
(yells angrily)

15:24.623 --> 15:26.691
(panting)

15:33.198 --> 15:36.034
(muffled whimpering)

15:40.139 --> 15:42.707
(muffled):
Oh, please, dandy...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.108
(sobbing):
Oh, please, no...

15:45.044 --> 15:46.611
No, no, no...

15:53.752 --> 15:55.820
(rapid, anxious gasping)

16:05.664 --> 16:06.731
Come with me.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.569
(crickets chirping)

16:30.622 --> 16:32.690
(panting)

16:57.116 --> 16:58.516
Elsa?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.357
Elsa!

17:20.239 --> 17:22.306
Hello?

17:24.743 --> 17:26.144
Anybody home?

17:29.581 --> 17:31.049
Hey!

17:34.987 --> 17:38.156
(echoing):
No!

18:11.457 --> 18:12.523
(grunts)

18:24.303 --> 18:25.603
(sobs quietly)

18:26.538 --> 18:27.772
Oh, god...

18:36.882 --> 18:38.983
(sobbing)

18:56.335 --> 18:59.403
(gentle melody plays on harp)

19:02.441 --> 19:05.076
â™ª

19:05.078 --> 19:07.478
(flute joins in)

19:19.758 --> 19:21.759
Father kelly:
Do you, bette tattler,

19:21.761 --> 19:26.364
Take dandy mott to be your
lawful wedded husband?

19:26.366 --> 19:30.034
My faithful partner in life...

19:30.036 --> 19:32.370
And my one, true love.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.039
Dandy:
In sickness and in health,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.942
In joy and sorrow,

19:37.944 --> 19:41.112
Through the good times
and the bad,

19:41.114 --> 19:42.613
Till death do us part.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.349
Father kelly:
Uh, you may kiss the bride.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.362
Mrs. Mott.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.867
Who could ever
have imagined it?

20:06.572 --> 20:08.406
Are you happy for
your sister, dot?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.241
Of course.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.144
I'd hate for you to feel
like a third wheel.

20:13.146 --> 20:15.246
Especially on
our wedding night.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.648
Bette and I
have talked about this.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.218
We both agree you should
have your privacy.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.326
It's an old trick, I've been
doing it since we were little.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.161
I just leave my body.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.097
Well, I'd like to think

20:33.099 --> 20:35.600
You'd want to join us,
from time to time...

20:35.602 --> 20:37.168
In our revels.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.438
Do bear in mind, dot,
I can...

20:40.440 --> 20:44.175
Get very nasty if
my manhood is compromised.

20:46.111 --> 20:49.947
A stallion demands a certain
respect from all his mares.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.282
First things first.

20:51.284 --> 20:55.119
We have prepared
a gorgeous wedding feast

20:55.121 --> 20:57.622
Of all of your favorites.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.125
The housekeeper we hired,
she's a french-trained cook.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.127
(both giggling)

21:03.129 --> 21:07.131
I do believe I am the
luckiest man alive right now.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.200
And I, the luckiest woman.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.038
Bette:
<i>To my new...</i>

21:14.040 --> 21:17.208
Wonderful husband.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.278
To   <i>ou</i>wonderful
new husband.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.648
Cheers.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.053
We are going to have
the most splendid life, girls.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.155
You'll see.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.057
And on our honeymoon safari,

21:33.059 --> 21:38.162
I'll hunt the biggest cats
and skin them up for rugs.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.499
Maybe our children will
romp around on them someday.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.502
How many children are you
proposing, mr. Mott?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.736
A whole lot of 'em.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.571
(laughing)

21:47.573 --> 21:49.907
I've always found babies
to be so boring,

21:49.909 --> 21:53.577
But freak babies... Oh...

21:53.579 --> 21:55.746
Do you think we might even make
a three-headed girl?

21:55.748 --> 21:59.083
We can certainly try.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.284
Every day, up in the playroom,

22:00.286 --> 22:02.320
We'll put on
our very own freak show!

22:07.926 --> 22:08.993
(groans, sighs)

22:10.595 --> 22:12.596
(echoing): Are you feeling
all right, dandy?

22:12.598 --> 22:16.367
The excitement seems to have
gone straight to my head.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.536
(echoing):
Well, don't get too excited.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.272
We're just getting started.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.442
Maid, you're
very poorly trained.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.444
You're not allowed to sit
at the table with us.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.512
I ain't no maid.

22:29.781 --> 22:32.283
Mm, ring any bells?

22:32.285 --> 22:34.452
I know we all
look alike to you.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.287
What's going on?

22:36.289 --> 22:37.621
Wedding night's been cancelled.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.123
You've been had.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.291
Bette:
Did you honestly think,

22:40.293 --> 22:42.293
For one second,
that we'd lay with you,

22:42.295 --> 22:44.795
In your bed,
after you massacred

22:44.797 --> 22:46.297
Our entire family?

22:46.299 --> 22:47.631
But I was going to...

22:47.633 --> 22:49.133
Give you everything I have!

22:49.135 --> 22:51.235
We don't want your blood money.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.236
Bette...

22:52.238 --> 22:54.071
You said you loved me.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.807
You promised,
till death do us part!

22:56.809 --> 22:59.744
Your death can't come
soon enough.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.078
But...

23:01.080 --> 23:02.413
But I believed you.

23:02.415 --> 23:06.050
My sister is truly
a great actress.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.753
Bette davis
couldn't have given

23:08.755 --> 23:10.087
A more convincing
performance.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.089
(dandy gasps)

23:12.091 --> 23:14.158
You put something
in my bubbly.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.898
(gunshot, dandy screams)

23:26.104 --> 23:27.171
That's mine!

23:27.173 --> 23:29.173
Sit down, dandy.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.076
Sit down!

23:35.781 --> 23:37.448
(groaning)

23:37.450 --> 23:39.850
Desiree:
I think it's time
for the next course.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.685
Butler!

23:44.122 --> 23:45.790
You...

23:45.792 --> 23:48.125
How did you get in my house?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.361
I had some help.

23:50.363 --> 23:55.299
Oh, dandy, how wonderful.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.467
Thank you.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.969
Of course.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.204
Dandy:
Um...

24:00.206 --> 24:01.806
Extra caviar.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.707
That's bette's.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.045
Dandy...
Hmm?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.480
Where are our beverages?

24:11.049 --> 24:12.883
Drat, the lemonade.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.319
Be right back with it.

24:18.223 --> 24:19.890
What is this?

24:26.832 --> 24:29.066
You're finally gonna be
a part of the show.

24:31.336 --> 24:34.238
The goddamn star attraction.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.741
Night-night, dandy.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.491
(water dripping)

24:56.361 --> 24:57.595
(head thumps)

25:12.777 --> 25:14.612
Let me out of here!

25:14.614 --> 25:16.614
Immediately!

25:16.616 --> 25:18.449
I do not like confined spaces!

25:18.451 --> 25:20.284
Desiree: Don't you know
where you are, baby?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.619
This is hardeen

25:21.621 --> 25:25.189
Houdini's famous escape tank.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.900
Can't we just
cut his balls off?

25:35.902 --> 25:37.902
We're carny folk.
Showmen.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.404
It's gotta be theatrical.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.239
It's what ma
would've wanted.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.741
Desiree:
<i>Once you're in...</i>

25:43.743 --> 25:46.577
The only way out is to escape.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.813
Jimmy: You wanted to be
the star of the show--

25:49.815 --> 25:50.981
Here's your chance, big shot.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.417
I'm not an escape artist.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.419
I'm a song-and-dance man!

25:55.421 --> 25:56.420
You're a murderer!

25:56.422 --> 25:57.421
You killed our family--

25:57.423 --> 25:59.256
Shot 'em dead in the dirt.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.424
Those were good people!

26:00.426 --> 26:02.092
I'm good people, too!

26:02.094 --> 26:04.094
I was just doing what god

26:04.096 --> 26:05.429
Put me on this earth to do.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.432
You ca... You...
You can't punish a man

26:08.434 --> 26:10.501
For fulfilling his purpose!

26:12.938 --> 26:15.606
Please... Please...

26:15.608 --> 26:17.207
My darlings...

26:17.209 --> 26:19.944
I forgive you
for all of this.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.614
Marriage is hard,
but I love you.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.617
Please just let
me out of here,

26:26.619 --> 26:29.453
And let's go home.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.688
Please.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.957
I want to go home.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.625
Dot:
Well, you're about
to go home.

26:34.627 --> 26:37.962
Right down to hell.

26:37.964 --> 26:42.866
Bette, you of all people
know my heart.

26:50.308 --> 26:52.443
I hate you.

26:53.545 --> 26:54.778
I hate you!

26:56.715 --> 26:59.316
For taking my friends
from me!

26:59.318 --> 27:03.654
I felt so blessed
to finally have friends.

27:03.656 --> 27:06.056
And you took them all.

27:06.058 --> 27:09.994
Desiree: A lot of freaks
died on these cursed grounds.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.162
Some by your hand and some not.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.164
A man came
through here

27:14.166 --> 27:17.501
And started putting our kind
in glass jars.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.504
Filled up a museum
with our kind.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.340
Saw it with
my own eyes!

27:23.342 --> 27:25.909
That's where you think
freaks belong--

27:25.911 --> 27:30.614
Powerless, behind glass,
a human car crash

27:30.616 --> 27:35.452
To stare at and remind
you how lucky you are.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.453
(knob creaks)

27:36.455 --> 27:38.288
Well, maybe that's true.

27:38.290 --> 27:42.026
Maybe that's all we are, but let
me tell you this, pretty boy.

27:42.028 --> 27:46.697
You may look like a
motion picture dreamboat,

27:46.699 --> 27:50.601
But you are the biggest freak
of them all.

27:53.038 --> 27:54.938
(knob creaks)

27:57.375 --> 27:59.443
(yelling)

28:02.781 --> 28:03.781
(grunts)

28:03.783 --> 28:06.617
Please! I'll give you money.

28:06.619 --> 28:09.119
I have so much money.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.288
Assholes like you think
you can get away with anything.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.289
But I can't die!

28:12.291 --> 28:15.292
You see, I'm immortal!

28:15.294 --> 28:17.961
You are going to die!

28:17.963 --> 28:20.297
We sentence you and your
whole rotten world to death.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.298
Look at us.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.900
We will always win,

28:22.902 --> 28:24.735
Because we'll always defend
each other to the death.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.304
You want to know why? Because
we have no one else to turn to.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.974
The freaks shall inherit
the earth.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.257
(yells)

28:47.259 --> 28:48.759
(grunting)

28:48.761 --> 28:51.328
(yelling)

28:53.765 --> 28:56.166
(yelling continues)

29:01.773 --> 29:03.841
Please!

29:05.443 --> 29:07.678
Please!

29:07.680 --> 29:10.681
(sobbing)

29:14.853 --> 29:16.286
I hate you!

29:16.288 --> 29:19.690
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

29:27.132 --> 29:28.799
(chuckles)

29:28.801 --> 29:31.034
(gasping)

29:37.041 --> 29:38.542
(muffled yelling)

29:52.824 --> 29:55.626
Heck of a show.

29:57.662 --> 29:59.663
That boy

29:59.665 --> 30:02.733
Is a star.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.782
(movie projector clicking,
fanfare playing)

30:18.784 --> 30:20.284
Announcer: <i>Every little girl</i>
<i>dreams of becoming</i>

30:20.286 --> 30:22.119
<i>A hollywood star,</i>
<i>and now thanks to</i>

30:22.121 --> 30:24.421
<i>The hollywood chamber of</i>

30:24.423 --> 30:26.089
<i>To the top will have</i>

30:26.091 --> 30:28.192
<i>Into the very streets</i>

30:28.194 --> 30:30.260
<i>Welcome to the newly created</i>
<i>hollywood walk of fame</i>

30:30.262 --> 30:32.362
<i>In los angeles, california.</i>

30:32.364 --> 30:34.431
<i>Today, we're honoring</i>

30:34.433 --> 30:37.868
<i>Miss elsa mars--</i>
<i>winner of three emmy awards</i>

30:37.870 --> 30:40.437
<i>For her groundbreaking variety</i>
<i>show</i> the elsa mars hour,

30:40.439 --> 30:42.873
<i>A program which has</i>
<i>bravely expanded the notion</i>

30:42.875 --> 30:44.775
<i>Of what television can be.</i>

30:44.777 --> 30:46.777
<i>And we mustn't forget</i>
<i>she's a recording star</i>

30:46.779 --> 30:49.780
<i>With three gold albums</i>

30:49.782 --> 30:53.116
Ich bin elsa mars,

30:53.118 --> 30:56.954
<i>And her holiday favorite,</i>
<i>merry christmas, knuddelmaus.</i>

30:56.956 --> 30:58.789
<i>Of course, no woman's life</i>

30:58.791 --> 31:00.624
<i>Without a wonderful man</i>

31:00.626 --> 31:02.292
<i>Her husband and longtime</i>

31:02.294 --> 31:03.961
<i>Whom she married</i>
<i>in a private ceremony</i>

31:03.963 --> 31:06.463
<i>At her palatial home</i>

31:06.465 --> 31:08.398
<i>There are elsa's</i>
<i>beloved spaniels,</i>

31:08.400 --> 31:11.568
<i>Showbiz and box office--</i>

31:11.570 --> 31:14.905
<i>With all her many honors,</i>
<i>elsa mars can now add a star,</i>

31:14.907 --> 31:17.341
<i>On the hollywood walk of fame.</i>

31:17.343 --> 31:19.476
(fanfare ends)

31:19.478 --> 31:23.413
I adore being the star
of   <i>the elsa mars hour.</i>

31:23.415 --> 31:26.583
I mean, who wouldn't love
having their own tv show,

31:26.585 --> 31:29.086
Surrounded by such talent?

31:29.088 --> 31:33.824
Especially my own
real-life cowboy

31:33.826 --> 31:36.660
And personal manager,

31:36.662 --> 31:39.930
Michael "mr. Hollywood" beck.

31:39.932 --> 31:43.934
But being a television star
is a lot of hard work.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.336
So is wrangling that star.
(chuckles)

31:46.338 --> 31:51.909
And that's why we drink
campfire gold instant coffee.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.511
Mmm.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.780
Because...

31:56.782 --> 32:00.350
Herding cattle
isn't the only hard work...

32:02.453 --> 32:03.620
Cut!

32:03.622 --> 32:05.789
(bell rings)

32:05.791 --> 32:08.525
This is shite! This is shite!

32:08.527 --> 32:09.860
Pure shite!

32:09.862 --> 32:11.295
Where are the
writers? Huh?

32:11.297 --> 32:13.130
The writers! Are you hiding?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.798
I shouldn't blame you...

32:14.800 --> 32:16.300
Michael: Darling,
it's a coffee commercial.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.201
Just say the damn words
and move on?

32:18.203 --> 32:19.870
First of all,
this coffee tastes

32:19.872 --> 32:21.038
Like piss.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.973
But why would you
paint me

32:22.975 --> 32:25.142
As some dumb,
headstrong animal

32:25.144 --> 32:26.910
That my husband
has to wrangle?

32:26.912 --> 32:28.078
Huh?

32:28.080 --> 32:29.546
I mean, where
is the charm?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.715
Now, go work on it
for a while!

32:31.717 --> 32:33.784
I'll be in my dressing room.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.323
<i>Scheisse!</i>

32:39.325 --> 32:41.725
(door opens)
michael:
Knock knock, darling.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.493
There's someone to see you.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.998
Naughty you, demeaning your
wife in front of the world.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.666
Was that amusing
for you?

32:49.668 --> 32:51.335
We're working hard
to try and find

32:51.337 --> 32:52.669
Something
that'll please you.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.838
In the meantime,
remember judy manners?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.506
Vp of publicity
for the network?

32:56.508 --> 32:59.242
She wants to discuss promotion
for the Halloween show.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.911
You're joking, aren't you?

33:00.913 --> 33:03.580
We'd like to do a spread
for <i>parade magazine--</i>

33:03.582 --> 33:05.248
You two at home,

33:05.250 --> 33:07.117
Carving pumpkins,

33:07.119 --> 33:09.586
Maybe baking some
pfeffernusse cookies

33:09.588 --> 33:12.823
For the trick-or-treaters.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.427
What my pussy of a husband

33:17.429 --> 33:20.197
Has neglected to tell you

33:20.199 --> 33:22.766
Is there will be
no Halloween show.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.701
I never perform

33:24.703 --> 33:26.103
On Halloween.
You're contractually

33:26.105 --> 33:28.372
Obligated to do
three specials a year.
I said

33:28.374 --> 33:32.109
I will not perform on Halloween.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.777
Darling, they've booked
andy williams.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.278
Imagine you two singing

33:35.280 --> 33:38.281
"autumn leaves"
in matching pumpkin suits--

33:38.283 --> 33:40.283
America will
lap it up.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.119
(short laugh)

33:42.121 --> 33:45.789
You know, when I first met him,

33:45.791 --> 33:49.292
He was some
junior so-and-so,

33:49.294 --> 33:51.962
Hanging out in the
lobby of the studio.

33:51.964 --> 33:54.898
I made him my manager.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.734
And then...

33:57.736 --> 33:59.236
I made the colossal mistake

33:59.238 --> 34:01.238
Of marrying him.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.573
And now he thinks he
knows better than I

34:03.575 --> 34:05.809
What my audience wants.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.648
I live to serve.

34:11.650 --> 34:15.585
There will be no Halloween show.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.521
You got that, chickies?

34:17.523 --> 34:19.489
Where are
you going?

34:23.327 --> 34:26.263
I have a luncheon engagement...

34:26.265 --> 34:28.331
At home.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.005
<i>(door closes)</i>

34:48.619 --> 34:52.689
Tell me-- what have you
been doing since florida?

34:52.691 --> 34:56.460
I'm sorry that I had to run
off the way I did, but...

34:56.462 --> 34:58.295
You know my motto:

34:58.297 --> 35:00.797
Always leave them wanting more.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.633
I left when you left.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.035
Please, let's sit.

35:05.037 --> 35:07.971
I went to,
uh, nevada.
Nevada?

35:07.973 --> 35:10.640
Ah.
Thank you.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.642
Uh, the army, uh,

35:12.644 --> 35:16.246
They wanted carpenters,
uh, that they could, uh,

35:16.248 --> 35:18.315
Use to build villages, uh,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.484
To blow up
with their atomic bombs.

35:20.486 --> 35:24.154
It took us ages
to build these towns

35:24.156 --> 35:26.823
And then-- boom!
Gone. In a flash.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.825
(speaks italian)
(short chuckle)

35:28.827 --> 35:31.628
Yes, I know what that's like.

35:32.997 --> 35:35.398
Elsa.
Hmm?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.235
I have seen your star ascend.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.739
(grunts)

35:42.741 --> 35:44.341
Massimo:
<i>If I would have told you,</i>

35:44.343 --> 35:46.476
<i>As you lay</i>
<i>in my workshop in berlin...</i>

35:48.079 --> 35:49.579
<i>...That all this</i>
<i>was soon to come,</i>

35:49.581 --> 35:50.914
<i>You would have said</i>

35:50.916 --> 35:53.083
That I was mad.
Now look at you.

35:53.085 --> 35:55.819
You have everything
you ever wanted. Huh?

35:57.755 --> 36:00.023
I'm bored.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.092
And I am alone.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.531
All my friends are
on the payroll.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.533
They say yes to
anything I ask

36:09.535 --> 36:11.201
Because they know
if they don't,

36:11.203 --> 36:14.204
They will be cast out
of the paradise known as

36:14.206 --> 36:16.940
<i>The elsa mars hour.</i>

36:22.613 --> 36:25.115
My husband cheats on me.

36:25.117 --> 36:27.350
I cheat on him.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.788
No, massimo,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.290
I have always, always,

36:33.292 --> 36:35.792
Always been cursed.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.628
First by...

36:38.630 --> 36:40.897
Having my dreams
ripped away.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.567
And now I am cursed by
having them all come true.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.570
Oh, you are tired,
uh, exhausted.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.071
That is all.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.140
Eight years ago...

36:53.477 --> 36:55.579
...My best friend

36:55.581 --> 36:57.814
Made me a birthday cake.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.417
That night,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.819
When she and
I sat over

37:02.821 --> 37:05.589
My candle, my birthday wish

37:05.591 --> 37:09.326
Was plain and simple.

37:09.328 --> 37:12.062
I just wanted to be loved.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.333
Little did I know that

37:16.335 --> 37:18.501
Every step that I
would take since then

37:18.503 --> 37:21.171
Would be one step
further away from

37:21.173 --> 37:23.573
Making that wish...

37:23.575 --> 37:25.642
Come true.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.613
Let's run away together.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.114
Yes.
Like we talked about
in the old days.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.449
Do you remember?

37:32.451 --> 37:34.951
We could find an
apartment in rome

37:34.953 --> 37:36.953
On the appian way.
(chuckling)

37:36.955 --> 37:38.788
Refresh my italian, no?

37:38.790 --> 37:42.525
Get good and fat,
grow old together.

37:44.528 --> 37:46.529
Please.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.598
I just...

37:50.301 --> 37:52.469
I need to be with
someone I love.

37:52.471 --> 37:56.373
Um, elsa,
now I am cursed...

37:56.375 --> 37:57.974
With a dream
that comes too late.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.143
I came to...

38:00.145 --> 38:03.213
To say good-bye.

38:03.215 --> 38:04.714
I, uh...

38:04.716 --> 38:07.484
I have

38:07.486 --> 38:09.486
A disease in my lungs, uh,

38:09.488 --> 38:11.488
That has gone into my bones.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.491
Uh, they say
that I only have a month.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.159
(exclaims)

38:16.161 --> 38:19.396
And then I will be gone.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.738
And now there will be
no one left, huh?

38:32.843 --> 38:34.911
Well.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.680
(sniffles)

38:40.584 --> 38:42.585
(door opens)
michael: Elsa?

38:42.587 --> 38:44.254
(door closes)

38:44.256 --> 38:47.190
Leave me alone,
michael, I'm drinking.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.259
Hello, elsa.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.999
(short chuckle)

38:57.535 --> 39:01.204
You should have called, huh?

39:01.206 --> 39:04.040
I did not know you were bringing
mr. Gable home with you.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.875
I do hope

39:05.877 --> 39:07.444
The head of the network

39:07.446 --> 39:10.447
Didn't come all the way out here

39:10.449 --> 39:14.451
To talk to me about
the Halloween show, because...

39:14.453 --> 39:16.286
I've made up my mind

39:16.288 --> 39:18.788
And I am not going to do it.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.623
This isn't about
Halloween, elsa.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.192
No?

39:23.794 --> 39:25.028
(giggles)

39:26.230 --> 39:27.964
This sounds serious.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.068
Can I get you
a drink, mr. Gable?

39:32.070 --> 39:34.471
Could definitely
use one.

39:38.909 --> 39:42.979
Now, why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

39:44.982 --> 39:47.584
It seems hedda hopper
got her hands

39:47.586 --> 39:51.254
On some eight millimeter films
you shot back in germany.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.256
The content--

39:53.258 --> 39:54.591
How can I put this?--

39:54.593 --> 39:56.659
Is quite graphic in nature.

39:59.597 --> 40:02.599
I don't know.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.268
Fakes, forgeries?

40:05.270 --> 40:07.103
It's not me.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.772
It looked a lot like you, elsa.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.241
You've seen them?
Gable:
Just now.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.276
Mr. Chandler over at the <i>times</i>
<i>is a close personal friend.</i>

40:13.278 --> 40:16.613
He gave us
a private screening.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.615
No one's gonna believe
it's not you.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.518
You told me you lost
your legs in a rail accident.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.520
You lied to me?

40:23.522 --> 40:25.522
That's what we do.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.791
We lie to each other.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.959
This whole marriage

40:29.961 --> 40:33.129
Is one stinking, stupid,

40:33.131 --> 40:34.464
Ugly lie!

40:34.466 --> 40:37.267
I'll pack my things.

40:40.304 --> 40:41.805
Mr. Gable,

40:41.807 --> 40:43.206
We can fix this, right?

40:43.208 --> 40:44.641
I mean...

40:44.643 --> 40:46.643
I mean, everybody
has a price, right?

40:46.645 --> 40:48.711
We tried to reason
with miss hopper,

40:48.713 --> 40:49.813
She won't have it.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.816
She's publishing
her article next week.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.384
But that will ruin me.

41:01.325 --> 41:04.494
I'll become...
(chuckles lightly)

41:04.496 --> 41:07.997
Just some...

41:07.999 --> 41:10.667
Bizarre footnote
in hollywood history.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.236
There's one more thing.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.004
What?

41:15.006 --> 41:17.440
Hopper hired some amateur
sleuth to retrace your steps.

41:17.442 --> 41:20.844
Which led back to
jupiter, florida.

41:20.846 --> 41:23.246
Apparently, you ran
a freak show.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.081
Yes.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.449
For a short time.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.084
It was an act of charity.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.086
I just, uh...

41:30.088 --> 41:32.021
I felt sorry for them.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.090
Sorry?
(laughs)

41:37.027 --> 41:38.261
They're all dead.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.100
What?

41:46.036 --> 41:48.037
All of them?

41:48.039 --> 41:51.040
There was some kind of massacre.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.042
Bodies found in a mass grave.

41:53.044 --> 41:56.613
I don't know if you read the
fine print in your contract,

41:56.615 --> 41:58.681
But there's a
morals clause.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.185
Obviously, we'll pay
out your contract.

42:06.123 --> 42:07.524
I've changed my mind.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.528
About what?

42:13.898 --> 42:18.034
I will perform on Halloween.

42:20.571 --> 42:22.572
Why not?

42:22.574 --> 42:23.907
(chuckles)

42:23.909 --> 42:26.309
Might as well go out
with a bang.

42:41.425 --> 42:42.825
Places, everyone.

42:42.827 --> 42:46.329
Elsa mars'
Halloween spooktacular.

42:50.834 --> 42:53.770
And we are on
in five, four,

42:53.772 --> 42:55.772
Three, two...

42:55.774 --> 42:57.840
(applause)

43:05.282 --> 43:08.351
(david bowie's "heroes" begins)

43:22.132 --> 43:25.468
â™ª I...

43:25.470 --> 43:27.870
â™ª I wish you could swim

43:30.474 --> 43:33.810
â™ª like the dolphins

43:33.812 --> 43:36.546
â™ª like dolphins can swim

43:39.483 --> 43:41.484
â™ª though nothing

43:41.486 --> 43:44.554
â™ª nothing will keep us
together â™ª

43:47.324 --> 43:50.994
â™ª we can beat them

43:50.996 --> 43:55.398
â™ª forever and ever

43:55.400 --> 43:59.669
â™ª oh, we can be heroes

43:59.671 --> 44:01.838
â™ª just for one day

44:01.840 --> 44:04.841
Desiree: Boys, hold on
to your daddy's hand.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.175
Hey, hey, come
back here.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.844
Give me your hand.

44:07.846 --> 44:09.579
All right,
give me your hand.

44:17.254 --> 44:19.022
What are you
looking at, wife?

44:19.024 --> 44:21.090
Tv we got at home
is just fine.

44:23.027 --> 44:26.763
Everything we got at home
is just fine.

44:29.033 --> 44:30.366
Jimmy:
You got to give it to her,

44:30.368 --> 44:32.101
The old broad's got guts.

44:33.537 --> 44:35.605
Always did.

44:38.542 --> 44:42.111
â™ª though nothing

44:42.113 --> 44:46.616
â™ª will drive them away

44:46.618 --> 44:48.951
â™ª we can be heroes

44:48.953 --> 44:50.953
Bette:
We've got it.

44:50.955 --> 44:55.625
â™ª just for a day

44:55.627 --> 44:56.793
How are my girls
feeling?

44:56.795 --> 44:58.728
Just fine.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.797
All of us.

45:04.568 --> 45:07.737
â™ª I...

45:07.739 --> 45:11.908
â™ª I can remember

45:11.910 --> 45:14.410
â™ª standing

45:14.412 --> 45:17.547
I feel like I've seen
this act before.

45:20.918 --> 45:24.921
â™ª <i>and the guns</i> â™ª

45:24.923 --> 45:28.925
â™ª <i>shot above our head</i> â™ª

45:28.927 --> 45:32.328
â™ª <i>and we kissed</i> â™ª

45:32.330 --> 45:36.733
â™ª <i>as though nothing could fall</i> â™ª

45:37.768 --> 45:42.071
â™ª and the shame

45:42.073 --> 45:46.075
â™ª was on the other side

45:46.077 --> 45:50.113
â™ª oh, we can beat them

45:50.115 --> 45:53.015
â™ª forever and ever

45:53.017 --> 45:55.618
â™ª and we could be heroes

45:55.620 --> 45:58.121
No, no, no,
the mist doesn't come up

45:58.123 --> 45:59.455
Until the goblin sketch.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.524
What the hell?

46:11.468 --> 46:13.536
Why did she stop singing?

46:17.574 --> 46:19.308
Ever since I heard
your story,

46:19.310 --> 46:20.810
I have not forgotten

46:20.812 --> 46:23.546
The black soul that was once
within my grasp.

46:24.982 --> 46:26.716
Take me now.

46:28.986 --> 46:30.820
This is a suicide.

46:30.822 --> 46:34.157
How deep your pain
must be, my lovely.

46:34.159 --> 46:37.727
I am the biggest freak of all.

46:38.829 --> 46:41.898
Elsa, what
are you doing?

46:48.839 --> 46:50.673
The day of reckoning
is here.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.508
Twisted clown:
It hurts,

46:52.510 --> 46:54.744
But only for a moment.

47:00.083 --> 47:01.651
(whooshing)

47:08.525 --> 47:11.260
Your place is not with us.

47:15.866 --> 47:18.301
(whooshing)

47:18.303 --> 47:20.770
â™ª

47:41.959 --> 47:45.027
(whooshing)

47:47.731 --> 47:50.233
Welcome, miss elsa.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.901
I missed you.

47:51.903 --> 47:54.070
(gasps)
oh!

47:54.072 --> 47:56.239
Ma petite.

47:56.241 --> 47:58.741
My special one.

47:58.743 --> 48:01.410
Can it really, really be you?

48:01.412 --> 48:04.080
It really is me.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.482
It is.

48:08.585 --> 48:09.886
Hey, elsa.

48:11.421 --> 48:13.155
Paul:
You look wonderful
tonight, elsa.

48:13.157 --> 48:15.491
It's good to have you back.
We got married.

48:24.835 --> 48:27.837
Ethel:
I'll take it from here.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.274
You go get your face on.

48:31.276 --> 48:33.309
Okay, miss ethel.

48:38.282 --> 48:41.350
(sighs)

48:47.958 --> 48:50.459
I don't understand.

48:50.461 --> 48:53.596
Where is this place?

48:55.799 --> 48:58.134
Ethel?

48:58.136 --> 49:01.804
The sins of the living don't
add up to much around here.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.807
In life, we play the parts
we're cast in.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.610
But don't I have to pay?

49:07.612 --> 49:12.148
I mean, don't I have to pay
for my sins?

49:12.150 --> 49:15.985
For all the mistakes
I've made?

49:15.987 --> 49:19.488
Can you imagine
the police showing up

49:19.490 --> 49:21.891
At the old globe

49:21.893 --> 49:24.327
And arresting the guy
playing othello

49:24.329 --> 49:26.329
For murdering desdemona?

49:26.331 --> 49:28.497
Besides, it's like
you always said,

49:28.499 --> 49:29.999
Sweetheart.

49:30.001 --> 49:31.968
Stars never pay.

49:38.508 --> 49:41.177
It ain't so bad
around here, you know?

49:41.179 --> 49:43.012
Full house every night.

49:43.014 --> 49:44.947
Family together.

49:44.949 --> 49:47.583
The only downside has been,

49:47.585 --> 49:49.919
You know, we've been missing
our headliner.

49:49.921 --> 49:53.856
Am I to perform? Now?

49:53.858 --> 49:55.758
Well, what the hell else
are you supposed to do?

49:55.760 --> 49:58.194
You're a terrible friend,
you're a pain-in-the-ass boss,

49:58.196 --> 49:59.862
You can't cook for shit.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.764
(footsteps approaching)

50:02.866 --> 50:04.533
All ready.

50:04.535 --> 50:06.035
â™ª

50:06.037 --> 50:08.604
(gasps)

50:11.041 --> 50:13.442
(loud, indistinct chatter)

50:22.452 --> 50:25.021
(drumroll)

50:27.958 --> 50:30.226
(cymbal crash)
ladies and gentlemen.

50:30.228 --> 50:32.228
Children of all ages.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.897
You have all looked up
at the night sky

50:34.899 --> 50:38.901
And seen the sparkle
of millions of dead stars.

50:38.903 --> 50:41.237
They flickered out
centuries ago,

50:41.239 --> 50:44.240
And only now does
their light reach our eyes.

50:44.242 --> 50:46.909
But have you ever wondered

50:46.911 --> 50:49.245
When they were alive
and burning,

50:49.247 --> 50:51.914
Which one shined the brightest?

50:51.916 --> 50:56.986
Well, tonight,
right here on this stage,

50:56.988 --> 51:00.089
I'm gonna give you
an answer to that question.

51:00.091 --> 51:03.426
Tonight, you will see

51:03.428 --> 51:07.596
The brightest and the best

51:07.598 --> 51:11.434
That ever was and ever will be.

51:11.436 --> 51:15.905
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

51:15.907 --> 51:18.741
Miss elsa mars!

51:20.777 --> 51:23.312
(muffled applause)

51:24.948 --> 51:27.416
(muffled applause and whistling)

51:30.787 --> 51:33.189
(whooping, whistling,
applause and cheering)

51:37.794 --> 51:40.196
(muffled applause, cheering
and whistling)

51:44.968 --> 51:47.803
(gentle piano intro plays)

51:47.805 --> 51:50.272
(muffled applause continues)

52:00.984 --> 52:03.786
