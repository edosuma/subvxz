00:01.002 --> 00:02.401
- FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Previously on "Sistas"...

00:02.403 --> 00:04.136
- How the hell did you get
in my house?

00:04.138 --> 00:05.404
- I am not gonna
take this anymore!

00:05.406 --> 00:07.539
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

00:10.811 --> 00:12.144
- This ain't over!

00:12.146 --> 00:13.846
- I put rubber bullets
in the gun.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.314
- I'm just glad you're okay.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.249
- I don't want to live another
moment without you.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.986
- I walked in my house, and Gary
had two women in my bedroom.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.055
When is it gonna happen
that I meet a man

00:23.057 --> 00:24.656
and it's drama free?

00:24.658 --> 00:27.292
Have you ever felt like
you met someone

00:27.294 --> 00:29.561
and you've known them
for years?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.263
- I feel like
I've known you forever.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.098
- What do I do now?

00:33.100 --> 00:35.701
- Stop letting the drama
come to you, Andi.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.938
- This stock is gonna be worth
a lot of money in 48 hours.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.841
- You may want to talk to me
about this insider trading.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.344
- And he come to me,
talking about going to the feds.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.180
- The -- are you doing?

00:48.182 --> 00:50.182
- We're going to your bank,
and you're gonna give me

00:50.184 --> 00:51.583
all the money that's
in that bitch.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.218
- Sabrina, do whatever he says.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.887
- Now, you're gonna come open
the safe, alright?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.088
- We can't do that.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.389
- I will blow his
-- brains out.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.558
- I wasn't sure if you
wanted to see me or not.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.860
- I want to see you, just not--
- Every day.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.328
- Yeah.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.064
- I can't compete with you
putting this other dude

01:05.066 --> 01:06.598
on a pedestal like that.
- I'm not putting him

01:06.600 --> 01:08.100
on a pedestal.
- Yes, you are.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.868
Do what you gotta do
to get this off of you.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.437
Don't call me until you do.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.038
- Zac.
- What, Karen?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.140
- I'm pregnant.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.843
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye, Zac.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.913
- This is life.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.549
- Hey.
- Shit.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.384
- And you know what
you do in life?

01:25.386 --> 01:27.953
- Don't, don't rush off.
We would like to do it again.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.322
- Who is we?

01:30.324 --> 01:32.224
- You mind if I join in?

01:32.226 --> 01:33.959
- You live it.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.727
- We're always going
to be sisters.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.563
We love you. We do.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.666
Ever, ever.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.367
- Well, in that case,
let me drink up.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.602
- Right.
- [glasses clink]

01:43.604 --> 01:45.871
- Oh yeah? Oh, you
gonna set me up?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.707
- Ah! Get your ass
back here!

01:50.211 --> 01:51.243
- [knock on door]

01:51.245 --> 01:52.778
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.448
- I didn't know you had company.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.584
- We're not company,
we're family.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.485
- Exactly.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.254
- ♪ I'm free to...
be what I wanna be ♪

02:02.256 --> 02:03.689
♪ See what I wanna see ♪

02:03.691 --> 02:05.624

02:05.626 --> 02:07.526
♪ That's for sure--

02:14.735 --> 02:17.669
- No! No! No!
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.971
You okay?

02:18.973 --> 02:20.339
- Shit.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.508
- Was it a bad dream?

02:22.510 --> 02:26.979
- No. What time is it?
- It's a little after nine.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.514
- Then I have to go to work.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.482
- No, I already called Fatima--
- Why did you do that?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.050
Now Fatima's gonna know
that we were together.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.120
- She's gonna know that you're
coming in a little after nine.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.223
- Shit.
Okay. Okay.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.459
I have to get to work.
- Hey, hey, hey, just come on.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.494
- Robin, I have to go to work.
- Just talk with me

02:42.496 --> 02:45.931
for a second, you always call
me when you're drinking.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.366
- Shit.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.968
- What?

02:49.970 --> 02:52.471
- I've heard that before.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.641
- That you call guys
when you drink?

02:55.643 --> 03:00.746
- I'm a little more aggressive
when I've been drinking.

03:00.748 --> 03:05.317
- And when you don't?
- I'm shy.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.785
Don't laugh at me.
- That shit is funny.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.587
That is hilarious, okay.
- I'm very shy.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.122
- Okay, alright, Andi.
Okay.

03:10.124 --> 03:13.258
- You don't have to believe me,
but I do have to go to work.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.894
- Hey, I am the boss.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.732
- That's all the more reason
for me to go.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.606
- Okay. Why don't you
come to London with me?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.444
- London?
- Yeah.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.581
We can present the
settlement to the client.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.518
- I can't, no.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.422
- Come on, they already
have the plane ready.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.290
- The private jet?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.793
- Uh-huh, try not
to be impressed.

03:49.763 --> 03:54.633
- No, I can't do that.
I cannot do that, oh my god.

03:57.137 --> 04:01.240
- Okay, well, I don't ask
more than once.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.544
- I don't believe that.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.813
- Okay. Maybe three times
when it comes to you.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.115
- Mm-hmm,
that's more like it.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.351
- So, you're not gonna come?

04:12.353 --> 04:16.121
- Not this time.
But, next time.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.658
- Okay, as long as
there will be a next time.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.029
- There will be
a next time.

04:24.031 --> 04:27.132
- You sure you don't have time--
- No, no, no.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.301
- Okay, alright,
look at you.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.204
She is shy today, like.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.373
- I am. [laughs]

04:34.375 --> 04:37.509
- I like it,
I like sober Andi.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.245
- You see sober Andi
all the time at work.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.914
- Yes, but she's not
this girl.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.117
- That's fair.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.920
- So, I'll see you when
I get back?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.656
- Yes.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.724
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.329
I'm gonna go get changed.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.032
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.972
Don't watch me walk away!
- You know I will.

- Okay.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.353
- 'Cause your gay dude is
offensive to the whole class.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.089
- Well, it worked before.
- What does that even mean?

06:31.091 --> 06:33.291

way to throw them off.

06:33.293 --> 06:36.928

is going on?

06:36.930 --> 06:41.266

06:50.043 --> 06:52.878
- What the hell?
- Hey...

06:52.880 --> 06:55.614
- Has he been licking
your butt, too?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.350
- Preston, you are very
preoccupied with my ass crack.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.185
- Look, shit, I'm just asking.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.087
- What are you doing here?

07:02.089 --> 07:04.389
- I just wanted to stop by.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.993
- You wanted to stop by?
No call, text, smoke signal,

07:07.995 --> 07:10.228
ignoring me, I don't, I don't...

07:10.230 --> 07:13.999
- I lost my phone.
- That's a new one.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.002
That's a new one.
- Well...

07:17.004 --> 07:18.670
- I mean, does your cousin know,
I mean,

07:18.672 --> 07:21.039
she's not really your cousin,
through marriage,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.774
but does she know, maybe?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.110
- What are you talking about?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.679
- I've told you,
I don't like you stopping by.

07:27.681 --> 07:32.317
- I'm sorry. I thought you
would've been happy to see me.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.455
- We started this off wrong,
you know?

07:36.457 --> 07:40.358
We did, and I've been
working on me, you know?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.128
Listening to podcasts,
reading books,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.831
and I've been trying to
figure out how to say

07:45.833 --> 07:49.100
what's on my mind in the
most productive way possible.

07:49.102 --> 07:52.804
- You always say
what's on your mind.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.907
- Not when it comes to you.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.110
- I'm sorry,
I could've swore you did.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.346
- You know, I try,
but you like run out the door

08:01.348 --> 08:03.381
and like,
ignore me for days,

08:03.383 --> 08:07.452
so I tend to hold back.
- Fine, what is it?

08:09.623 --> 08:12.991
- Well one, you don't
respect my boundaries.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.862
- Me? I don't respect you?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.532
- Yeah. Is that such a
revelation?

08:20.534 --> 08:23.201
You don't respect
my boundaries, no.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.303
- Okay, I gotta hear this.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.938
- Yeah, well,
showing up unannounced,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.907
even though I've
asked you not to.

08:28.909 --> 08:34.613
You had my landlord let you in
without my permission, twice.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.349
But, I guess, you know,
you had steak,

08:37.351 --> 08:40.352
and you had flowers,
and you're nice,

08:40.354 --> 08:42.287
so I'm supposed to be
okay with it, right?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.689
I'm supposed to just ignore it?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.391
- I see.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.894
- So, that's part
of the problem, yeah.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.862
- Okay, so I won't do that.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.398
- See, you say that, right?
And I believe you.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.967
But then you do it again,
but in a different way.

08:55.969 --> 09:00.171
- Danni...
- Yeah.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.475
Like, do you even realize

09:03.477 --> 09:05.744
when you had me
chained up to that bed--

09:05.746 --> 09:07.245
- Oh my god.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.548
- No, and you
stood over me naked,

09:09.550 --> 09:12.717
and I said, "Let me go,"
you said, "Beg me, gal"?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.320
Do you even know what you
recreated when you did that?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.656
Do you even realize?
Any clue what that looked like?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.190
- And you've been holding
all this in?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.659
- Because I've been
trying to figure out

09:20.661 --> 09:23.495
why I'm uncomfortable
in my own home.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.866
- I apologized for that.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.201
- Yeah, you did.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.672
- Okay, so give me
some damn credit.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.174
- You've wanted to date black
women your whole life,

09:36.176 --> 09:39.678
and you didn't even realize you
recreated the Middle Passage?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.947
But you want
credit for apologizing?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.682
Credit without doing the work

09:43.684 --> 09:48.286
is called white privilege,
Preston. Do the work.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.490
- Okay.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.061
- And the other thing,
the thing that really got me--

09:56.063 --> 10:00.632
- Oh, please,
by all means, continue.

10:00.634 --> 10:04.035
- Your brothers
threatened my life.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.872
At my job.
They beat you bloody.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.942
And I brought you into my home,
my safe space,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.345
so that you would be safe.

10:13.347 --> 10:17.415
And the very next day,
you didn't give me one day,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.818
you had your sister in here.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.121
You didn't think enough of me
to call me, let me know,

10:23.123 --> 10:25.957
hell, forget asking my
permission.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.960
And no, no, no,

10:28.962 --> 10:32.430
I don't think you understand
how betrayed and unsafe

10:32.432 --> 10:34.265
I felt in my own home.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.202
- And I'm sorry about that.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.838
I don't know how many
times I can say that.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.273
- Preston, I don't know her,
you couldn't give me a day?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.509
- She is not like them.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.012

34:13.952 --> 34:16.253
- Hm. Well, I think he
really liked him.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.622
- You're talking about the
-- that stole everything?

34:18.624 --> 34:20.323
- I know.

34:20.325 --> 34:23.160
- Look, if he is falling back in
love with that dude,

34:23.162 --> 34:25.428
he's just crazy.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.697
- I just think it has to do with
his father, you know?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.667
I feel like he's trying
to save him, or...

34:30.669 --> 34:33.637
- Which is all the more reason
why we should hook him up.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.773
- Oh no no, no no, I have
nothing to do with this.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.275
This is all your brilliant idea.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.477
- Oh okay, okay,
so what if they hit it off,

34:40.479 --> 34:42.312
fall in love
and get married?

34:42.314 --> 34:43.847
Then what you gonna say?

34:43.849 --> 34:47.918
- Hm, then I'll take the credit.
- Yeah, I thought you would.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.619
- Here he comes.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.588
- You bitches really need to get
out of here!

34:51.590 --> 34:55.692
- Stop it, Maurice.
- Look at you. Go on!

34:55.694 --> 34:58.562
Surprised you can even stand in
the same place that you twirled

34:58.564 --> 35:02.766
and fell down like you had a
Statue of Liberty costume on.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.635
- Stop it now.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.537
- You know what?
I'll see you later.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.939
- Okay.
- Bye.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.674
- MAURICE: Bye.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.950
Don't you have customers?
- He was only trying to help.

35:19.952 --> 35:22.752
- He ain't no damn help.
Help her!

35:25.490 --> 35:28.091
- Excuse me, ma'am?
We can come right here.

35:32.664 --> 35:36.700
- Girl, massive.
I'm telling you, huge.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.935
- What?
- Yes.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.104
- [phone rings]
- Hold on. I got that.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.073
Where is the damn phone?
All these flowers.

35:43.075 --> 35:44.641
- Child...

35:47.179 --> 35:48.778
- This is Fatima.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.281
- SECRETARY: I'm sorry,
but Mr. Borders is here.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.083
- She's in a meeting.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.885
- SECRETARY: I told him that,
but...

35:54.887 --> 35:56.386
- You know what?
I'll be right there.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.521
- SECRETARY: Okay.
- Alright.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.757
Okay.
- I'm not in a meeting.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.592
- I'll be right back.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.995
- Okay. Hurry back
so I can tell you the rest.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.463
- FATIMA: Okay.

36:13.238 --> 36:16.006
- Hi. Can I help you?

36:16.008 --> 36:17.774
- Hi, Fatima,

36:19.945 --> 36:22.979
I need to see Andi.
- She's not here.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.648
- I know she's here.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.317
- Is she?

36:27.319 --> 36:32.289
Oh, she's in a meeting. Yeah.
- Really? Come on.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.658
- She's busy!

36:34.660 --> 36:38.695
- Alright, well um,
I'll sit right here and wait.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.363
- Okay. Suit yourself.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.933
You'll be sitting there
until tomorrow.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.101
- Okay look, she's not taking
any of my phone calls.

36:45.103 --> 36:47.771
- Uh, that's...

36:47.773 --> 36:50.573
- And y'all playing games.

36:50.575 --> 36:53.243
- Sorry.

36:53.245 --> 36:58.048
- Okay.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.417
- Okay.
- Whoa, uh-uh.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.018
You cannot go back there.
- Watch me.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.955
- You want me to call security?
- Uh-uh, hey, hey, I got this.

37:04.957 --> 37:08.091
Please make me show my ass in
front of these white people,

37:08.093 --> 37:11.561
because I will.
I am not her.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.798
I will beat your ass and make
you catch the case.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.166
Mm-hmm.

37:16.168 --> 37:20.670
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Can you just go?

37:20.672 --> 37:24.140
- Actually, can I talk to you?
- --, I don't like you.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.775
- I know, but listen--
- I'm not gonna tell

37:25.777 --> 37:27.711
you again.
- I just want to talk to--

37:27.713 --> 37:29.913
- You're still talking.
Do you see these steps?

37:29.915 --> 37:32.148
Do you see them?

37:32.150 --> 37:34.818
- What are you gonna do,
throw me down them?

37:34.820 --> 37:38.788
- No. I'm gonna fall down them
and say that you did it,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.890
hence your case.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.364
Good.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.734
I was beginning to think
you're completely stupid.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.309
- Are you kidding me?

37:59.311 --> 38:03.480
- Dead serious. It's amazing.
He's amazing.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.549
- Damn.
- ANDI: What?

38:06.551 --> 38:09.119
- This is so good,
I'm happy for you.

38:09.121 --> 38:13.857
- Don't be happy for me yet.
- Why not?

38:13.859 --> 38:15.759
- Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something,

38:15.761 --> 38:17.994
but you can't tell
anyone else.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.263
- Okay, what's that?

38:20.265 --> 38:24.934
- Robin is the boss.
- What?

38:24.936 --> 38:28.505
- He owns the company.
- When did that happen?

38:28.507 --> 38:31.041
- Apparently he puts all the
older white men in front,

38:31.043 --> 38:37.113
but he runs the company.
And he just bought our division.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.349
- What the hell?

38:39.351 --> 38:42.786
Wait, so you're telling me he
got money like that?

38:42.788 --> 38:45.755
- Oh yeah. Enough to have
a private jet.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.858
- Oh, shit.
He got that real money.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.628
- Big bank.
- Oh-ho! This is good.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.597
This is really good.
- It's good,

38:54.599 --> 38:58.101
but I'm just...
- Taking your time?

38:58.103 --> 39:01.438
- Yeah. Taking my time.
- Please do.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.373
- ANDI: I am.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.442
- Yeah, just don't
rush it, okay?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.944
- Oh, like you're
rushing it with Zac?

39:07.946 --> 39:10.480
- I am not.

39:10.482 --> 39:14.350
- I see it all over you.
I can see it all over you.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.087
- You see it, it's just the
glow, honey.

39:17.089 --> 39:19.656
Look, when it works,
it just works.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.392
- Yeah, I bet it works because
he has all that money now.

39:22.394 --> 39:25.028
- See, you brought that up,
but that doesn't hurt.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.696
It does not.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.599
- How has he been?

39:29.601 --> 39:34.871
- Look, I don't know the old
Zac, but this Zac is so happy.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.943
- Karen wouldn't want to
hear that right now.

39:39.945 --> 39:43.079
- Don't say her name
before her ass pop up.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.182
- Fatima.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.519
What's going on?
- I don't know.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.923
- Okay, well maybe
we need to run too.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.525
Come in.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.928
What's going on?

39:58.930 --> 40:01.331
- Hayden. He's been found
dead in the parking lot.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.932
- What?

40:02.934 --> 40:05.301
- Yeah, he's dead.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.537
- What the hell?
Okay, um...

40:10.742 --> 40:12.175
- ANNOUNCER: Next
on Sistas...

40:12.177 --> 40:13.676
- ZAC: Did that mother--
do something to her?

40:13.678 --> 40:14.844
- Who are you talking about,
Zac?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.312
- Hayden's bitch ass.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.081
- ANDI: No, he didn't do
anything to her.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.782
- He better not, 'cause I'll
kill that mother--.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.351
- They're letting me out.
- What?

40:21.353 --> 40:23.586
- QUE: Yeah, all I gotta do is
show up in court.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.221
- No sir, no.
- What?

40:25.223 --> 40:26.523
- No.
- What are you talking about?

40:26.525 --> 40:28.124
- You are not taking her
out of here.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.226
- You both were pissed at him,
that means you are what?

40:30.228 --> 40:31.694
Suspects!

40:31.696 --> 40:34.964
- You keep the car.
- Gary.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.267
- I'm gonna earn you back.
- Take this.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.636
- I don't care what it takes,
and this ain't all I've got.
