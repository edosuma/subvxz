00:00.050 --> 00:01.550
_

00:01.576 --> 00:02.839
We slept together.

00:02.865 --> 00:04.445
She said you raped her.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.336
- I love you, Katy.
- Stop it.

00:06.362 --> 00:08.242
Andrew Earlham's wife took an overdose.

00:08.268 --> 00:10.753
No evidence it was anything
other than suicide.

00:10.779 --> 00:13.319
The CPS won't be prosecuting your case.

00:13.345 --> 00:15.109
You don't want to come in
for a drink, do you?

00:15.200 --> 00:17.395
I don't drink with men who rape women.

00:17.421 --> 00:18.840
I broke into Andrew's house.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.080
Please help me.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.476
- What's going on?
- Andrew Earlham,

00:21.502 --> 00:23.067
we have a warrant to search your house.

00:23.093 --> 00:26.733
Lawsuits for defamation of character
can be a lengthy process.

00:26.759 --> 00:27.959
Oh, I know.

00:28.144 --> 00:31.000
Building my life to what it is today
was a lengthy process

00:31.040 --> 00:32.478
but she took a wrecking ball to that.

00:32.503 --> 00:33.745
She owes me.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.003
He was in my house.

00:53.029 --> 00:54.749
My house, Katy.

00:54.843 --> 00:58.428
He walked in and left my earring
there just to prove he could.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.532
Are you sure?

01:00.906 --> 01:02.601
<i>Who else could have put it there?</i>

01:03.160 --> 01:05.120
You need to call the police, now.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.639
And say what? They've been
no use so far, have they?

01:08.139 --> 01:09.619
<i>Look, you don't know that.</i>

01:09.645 --> 01:11.565
I have to protect myself, Katy.

01:11.595 --> 01:14.475
I'm not just going to sit back
while he messes with my life.

01:14.501 --> 01:15.981
Laura, what are you doing?

01:16.090 --> 01:17.610
I can't just let this lie.

01:17.636 --> 01:18.836
<i>Where are you, Laura?</i>

01:18.862 --> 01:20.622
<i>..to Edinburgh is now boarding.</i>

01:20.648 --> 01:23.961
- I've got to go.
- <i>Laura, wait, wait. Laura...</i>

02:01.581 --> 02:04.501
Hi, my name's Laura Nielson.

02:04.527 --> 02:07.167
- Are you Mrs Cassidy?
- Aye, that's me.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.800
Mary Earlham's mother?

02:09.360 --> 02:10.555
Yes.

02:10.900 --> 02:14.204
I wanted to ask you some questions
about your son-in-law, Andrew.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.167
Is it OK if I come in?

02:16.660 --> 02:18.940
Aye. Aye, come on in.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.441
Thank you.

02:28.418 --> 02:30.340
Sorry to keep you.

02:30.552 --> 02:32.552
It's fine.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.300
So...

02:37.561 --> 02:39.980
What was it you wanted to ask me
about Mary?

02:40.020 --> 02:41.687
Did you know her?

02:42.220 --> 02:44.140
She was a beautiful woman.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.700
Yes. That she was.

02:45.740 --> 02:47.260
Didn't know it, mind.

02:47.453 --> 02:50.471
She never could believe anything
good about herself.

02:51.249 --> 02:52.980
No matter what you told her.

02:53.105 --> 02:54.761
A shame, it was.

02:55.582 --> 02:57.092
Was she a chef?

02:57.300 --> 02:58.580
Catherine was.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.940
That's her partner next to her
in the photo.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.260
Best friends since they were nine,
those two.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.420
Mary was more focused
on the business side of things.

03:06.702 --> 03:10.140
They did these pop-up restaurants
and what have you.

03:10.433 --> 03:12.231
They ran a food truck, too.

03:12.665 --> 03:15.345
Catherine still keeps it going
down in the Grassmarket.

03:16.415 --> 03:17.575
They look good.

03:17.601 --> 03:19.220
Gingerbread dogs.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.963
Family tradition.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.842
Don't ask.

03:25.802 --> 03:28.202
What is it you want, Miss Nielson?

03:30.580 --> 03:32.940
I didn't know your daughter,
Mrs Cassidy.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.234
But, um...

03:35.355 --> 03:38.536
I do know your son-in-law,
Andrew Earlham.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.880
And erm...

03:41.940 --> 03:44.820
Christ... I'm not really
sure how to say this...

03:44.860 --> 03:46.020
Um...

03:46.239 --> 03:49.100
Just say it, dear.
It's as simple as that.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.230
Sometimes it isn't.

03:51.740 --> 03:58.540
Erm, a little while ago Andrew
and I went out on a date.

03:58.580 --> 04:03.896
And that evening,
he came back to my house...

04:04.862 --> 04:06.472
..and he raped me.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.899
Right now it's my word against his.
I can't prove a thing.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.740
And there was something else
in my past, an incident...

04:22.780 --> 04:24.645
What are you doing here?

04:25.123 --> 04:27.626
Did Andrew and your daughter
have any problems?

04:27.652 --> 04:29.820
Because I gather the police
seemed to think...

04:29.860 --> 04:32.523
The police asked a lot of
intrusive questions.

04:32.549 --> 04:34.383
They insinuated things.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.116
They dragged Andrew in and out
of the station a dozen times.

04:38.142 --> 04:39.502
But they never arrested him.

04:39.528 --> 04:41.628
Never found a shred of proof.

04:43.340 --> 04:45.660
Andrew was a good husband.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.060
Good son-in-law.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.600
And a wonderful father to Luke.

04:51.885 --> 04:54.380
I heard they were arguing a lot,
before your daughter...

04:54.420 --> 04:56.140
Yes, arguments within a marriage.

04:56.180 --> 04:58.180
Perish the thought!

05:01.900 --> 05:03.700
Mary wasn't a well girl.

05:05.537 --> 05:07.337
You know why I make these?

05:07.714 --> 05:11.714
Because when she was little,
Mary was afraid of gingerbread men.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.140
They terrified her.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.926
So I made gingerbread dogs instead.

05:16.543 --> 05:20.380
She was the most sensitive soul
I'd ever seen.

05:20.582 --> 05:23.302
She found the darkness in everything.

05:23.328 --> 05:24.900
She just couldn't help it.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.322
And it was the darkness
that took her over in the end.

05:28.348 --> 05:29.996
Swallowed her whole.

05:30.893 --> 05:32.860
But that's all it was.

05:33.007 --> 05:35.028
So when you come in here and you say...

05:35.054 --> 05:38.700
Well, I don't quite know what
it is you're implying about Andrew,

05:38.740 --> 05:40.820
what he may have done to my daughter...

05:41.260 --> 05:43.140
but you're making me uncomfortable.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.088
You're in my house
and you're crossing a line,

05:47.962 --> 05:49.647
so I'd like you to leave.

05:49.673 --> 05:51.820
Please. If there's just anything...

05:51.860 --> 05:53.431
Get out.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.922
I'm sorry.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.747
Hello?

06:29.260 --> 06:32.020
Hey. Hey, you're home early.
What's going on?

06:32.060 --> 06:34.780
I just didn't feel well.
The school nurse sent me home.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.139
Hey.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.580
It's all this...

06:40.752 --> 06:42.952
trouble with Miss Nielson, isn't it?

06:42.978 --> 06:45.290
- It's fine.
- No, it's not fine, Luke.

06:45.316 --> 06:48.500
Look, if you wanted to change schools,
maybe we could look into that.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.859
No.

06:50.860 --> 06:53.540
- It'll calm down, right?
- Yeah. Yes, it will.

06:54.140 --> 06:57.931
Because I'm taking steps to make
sure that people know the truth.

06:57.957 --> 07:00.057
Everything she said about me was a lie.

07:01.012 --> 07:03.134
None of this should ever have happened.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.424
And I'm so sorry you got caught up
in the middle of it.

07:06.094 --> 07:09.320
But believe you me,
it'll be over soon. All right?

07:09.400 --> 07:10.549
Yeah.

07:12.805 --> 07:14.804
You shouldn't be here
sitting on your arse.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.100
Get out and celebrate.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.180
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.940
And you should pop yourself in bed,
you know, work on your recovery.

08:14.540 --> 08:16.900
What were you doing in there?
It's been an hour.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.860
- <i>Listen...</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

08:18.900 --> 08:21.363
<i>Look, I was going to
talk to you about this.</i>

08:21.860 --> 08:25.531
I've asked for a transfer.
Crime training.

08:25.557 --> 08:27.300
Crime training? Are you serious?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.100
- I wouldn't be the first.
- You'll be the best.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.442
Why?

08:32.623 --> 08:34.623
He asked me out. On a date.

08:34.649 --> 08:35.900
- What...?
- Andrew Earlham.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.499
- Oh.
- I went to see him.

08:37.525 --> 08:39.179
Oh, Ness, you shouldn't have done that.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.756
He put on a smile,
flashed his filthy white teeth.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.142
And the look on his face.

08:43.168 --> 08:44.972
Like he thought I was gonna say yes.

08:44.998 --> 08:46.857
Like he thought I was actually
gonna go through with it.

08:46.883 --> 08:48.127
Can you believe that?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.014
You can't let people
like that get to you.

08:50.053 --> 08:52.995
You have to rely and
trust on your training.

08:53.301 --> 08:56.661
- Every day it's another Andrew Earlham.
- We all have weeks like that.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.367
- You just need a break.
- No, Rory.

08:58.393 --> 09:01.438
No, please, just think about it.

09:01.894 --> 09:03.545
And if your mind's still made up,

09:03.571 --> 09:06.571
well, that's that.

09:08.523 --> 09:10.108
All right.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.940
Hi. How can I help you?

09:38.980 --> 09:40.736
You're Catherine, aren't you?

09:41.021 --> 09:43.234
Yeah. Do I know you?

09:43.260 --> 09:45.580
No. I'm... I'm Laura Nielson.

09:45.888 --> 09:47.540
Please don't say you're
from the Inland Revenue.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.780
No, I'm not from the Inland Revenue.

09:50.929 --> 09:53.115
Um, have you got a minute?

09:53.141 --> 09:55.141
I think I can spare a minute or two.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.660
I don't know what to say.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
You don't have to say anything.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.500
What do you want with me?

10:08.825 --> 10:11.220
I wanted to find out more about him.

10:11.448 --> 10:13.208
- About Mary.
- Mary?

10:13.234 --> 10:15.151
I wondered if you knew anything
about them.

10:15.246 --> 10:17.209
About her marriage to Andrew.

10:17.531 --> 10:19.140
If there was anything unusual.

10:21.031 --> 10:23.593
She was my friend and she...

10:24.659 --> 10:26.406
She was depressed. And...

10:29.120 --> 10:30.720
..that's all there is.

10:32.016 --> 10:35.099
The police had suspicions, thought
something else was going on.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.312
Look, she was depressed
and she killed herself.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.800
And I wish to God that she hadn't but...

10:43.929 --> 10:46.329
..wishing it's not going to
change anything, is it?

10:52.620 --> 10:56.000
I saw Mary's mother and she shut
me down just like you're doing.

10:56.518 --> 10:58.938
Like there was something
she wasn't saying.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.663
Sorry.

11:04.482 --> 11:06.887
OK. Um, look...

11:07.725 --> 11:09.723
Here's my number.

11:10.414 --> 11:12.234
If you think of anything...

11:12.260 --> 11:13.538
call me.

11:15.220 --> 11:16.860
- OK?
- Yeah.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.220
Thanks for the coffee.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.953
Bye.

11:41.650 --> 11:45.730
<i>We are sorry to announce
Flight BA112 to London Gatwick</i>

11:45.770 --> 11:47.770
<i>has now been cancelled.</i>

11:47.810 --> 11:50.490
<i>This is due to adverse
weather conditions.</i>

11:50.530 --> 11:53.410
<i>Please speak to a member
of staff for more details.</i>

12:13.810 --> 12:15.624
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

12:16.576 --> 12:18.515
<i>The school says you're off ill today.</i>

12:18.770 --> 12:20.050
<i>Just checking in.</i>

12:20.090 --> 12:21.450
<i>Seeing how you were.</i>

12:21.690 --> 12:23.190
<i>Call me, all right?</i>

12:26.470 --> 12:29.438
I'd hate to think what the places
that didn't win that award look like.

12:31.490 --> 12:33.490
The plaque.

12:34.890 --> 12:37.788
Oh, right. I didn't see it.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.010
Seems OK.

12:41.050 --> 12:43.130
Try the food. You might not think so.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.096
Are you a regular, then?

12:47.890 --> 12:49.645
I fly around a lot for work.

12:49.671 --> 12:51.250
Not tonight, though, it would seem.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.090
Which is kind of a relief.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.386
- Your plane was cancelled as well?
- Yeah.

12:58.039 --> 13:01.278
They say "any port in a storm".
But this place, I don't know.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.904
Maybe I'd rather brave the storm.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.383
I'm Ian.

13:06.932 --> 13:09.612
Erm, Laura.

13:20.189 --> 13:22.827
- <i>Hey, gorgeous.</i>
- Hi, you.

13:22.853 --> 13:24.901
I'm sorry I couldn't call on time.
Were you worried?

13:24.927 --> 13:25.973
No.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.661
Liar.

13:27.687 --> 13:29.250
Technical problems, apparently.

13:29.290 --> 13:31.130
Really? In Iraq?

13:31.322 --> 13:32.930
That's a shock.

13:32.970 --> 13:34.370
So how are you?

13:34.572 --> 13:35.812
How's little pumpkin seed?

13:35.838 --> 13:38.610
Ah, well, she's a little olive now.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.916
"She"?

13:41.130 --> 13:42.808
Wishful thinking.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.410
What the hell is that?

13:46.450 --> 13:49.929
Eugh. I read this article
about super-juices.

13:50.370 --> 13:51.955
It was in some magazine

13:51.981 --> 13:54.097
and said you have to have
a different one every day,

13:54.123 --> 13:56.529
so the little olive gets
all the vitamins and shit.

13:56.555 --> 13:57.955
"Vitamins and shit".

13:57.981 --> 13:59.185
Nice.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.780
Just don't work too hard, OK?

14:01.806 --> 14:05.210
Yeah. Says the woman who spends
her whole day getting shot at.

14:05.489 --> 14:06.890
I really don't.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.403
Most of the time.

14:08.926 --> 14:10.890
And I'd still rather do that
than what you do.

14:10.930 --> 14:13.650
Yeah, right, cos I'm just
a rubbish collector.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.130
I don't change anything.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.694
I just sweep up the crap
after it's happened.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.852
And the next day,
it's all just there again.

14:19.878 --> 14:23.198
Hey. What you do is important.
It makes a difference to people.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.032
It's one of the reasons I fell
for you in the first place.

14:31.849 --> 14:33.130
Anyway...

14:33.373 --> 14:35.201
Tell me about sunny Mosul.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.650
Well, it's been
absolutely boiling today.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.379
And guess who didn't
put their sun cream on.

14:41.650 --> 14:43.650
Me!

14:46.050 --> 14:48.648
Social media solutions for companies.

14:48.674 --> 14:49.639
Mm.

14:49.664 --> 14:51.215
Who don't know how to use the Internet.

14:51.610 --> 14:52.930
Sounds interesting.

14:54.650 --> 14:56.890
It was. It is. It was...

14:56.930 --> 14:58.290
Yeah, it's OK.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.210
How about you? What do you do?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.130
Um, I'm a teacher.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.212
- A teacher?
- Yeah. So...

15:07.450 --> 15:08.651
Ah.

15:09.245 --> 15:12.475
Maybe I should give you a reading list.

15:13.082 --> 15:14.743
That would be great, yeah.

15:19.326 --> 15:21.098
Can I get you another?

15:24.450 --> 15:26.370
Er, no, thank you.

15:26.410 --> 15:29.130
I um... I should go to bed.

15:29.308 --> 15:31.628
Are you sure? Come on...

15:31.654 --> 15:34.108
- I can be quite persuasive.
- I said no.

16:11.650 --> 16:12.881
Hello.

16:15.030 --> 16:17.030
Catherine, hi.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.650
No, no, I appreciate you calling.

16:24.970 --> 16:28.930
Before Mary killed herself,
I slept with Andrew.

16:32.049 --> 16:34.329
All these years I've
thought it was my fault.

16:36.410 --> 16:38.410
But then I read what you wrote.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.310
And it made me realise...

16:43.852 --> 16:45.692
I thought I was drunk.

16:45.718 --> 16:48.690
And I thought that's why I couldn't
remember anything, you know.

16:48.730 --> 16:50.913
It felt like um...

16:51.450 --> 16:53.317
it happened to someone else.

16:54.035 --> 16:55.821
And I was watching.

16:57.543 --> 17:00.264
- He drugged you too.
- Yeah, he must have.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.210
I mean, I thought it was
the worst mistake of my life.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.075
But he said it was my idea.

17:08.786 --> 17:10.760
And I believed him.

17:11.050 --> 17:12.794
Oh, it's just pathetic.

17:12.819 --> 17:15.306
There is nothing pathetic about it.

17:15.770 --> 17:19.369
OK. Do you know how many people don't
even realise it's happened to them?

17:19.542 --> 17:22.463
Because they blame themselves,
or they're made to.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.050
And when they do realise, how...

17:25.089 --> 17:27.970
how few of them can bring
themselves to report it?

17:28.204 --> 17:31.125
Because somehow they're made
to feel like it's their fault.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.890
I don't know how...

17:41.958 --> 17:44.198
..but Mary found out
about Andrew and I and...

17:48.207 --> 17:50.207
And it was after that that she...

17:51.410 --> 17:54.285
Catherine, she must
have known the truth.

17:54.632 --> 17:56.689
She must have known what he's like.

17:57.765 --> 18:00.345
You don't have to carry this
around with you.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.653
It wasn't your fault.

18:03.613 --> 18:05.707
Why don't you come back with me?

18:06.663 --> 18:08.783
Talk to the police
about what happened to you.

18:08.809 --> 18:11.322
Please. People need to know.

18:11.348 --> 18:15.208
And we need to make sure
that Andrew never does this again.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.554
OK.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.810
Thank you, Catherine.

18:25.850 --> 18:28.274
Really, honestly, thank you.

18:28.813 --> 18:31.213
Thank me once we've put
Andrew Earlham in prison.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.710
You've been accused of misconduct.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.388
The charge is a sustained campaign of
harassment against Andrew Earlham.

18:49.414 --> 18:52.889
He says you were the reason for an
unjustified search of his property.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.562
Will you be contesting the accusations?

18:56.361 --> 18:57.648
Yes.

18:57.950 --> 19:00.133
We have assembled evidence
from other detectives

19:00.159 --> 19:01.924
of your interest in Andrew Earlham.

19:01.950 --> 19:04.427
Detectives asked you to step away
from a case that wasn't yours.

19:04.453 --> 19:08.232
We've talked to Detective Nigel Wilson
about his role in the search.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.070
Do you still wish to
contest the charges?

19:15.409 --> 19:17.768
- Come.
- Hey.

19:18.630 --> 19:21.590
Oh, hi. Er, I didn't...

19:21.630 --> 19:23.990
I'm sorry. I know, I should have called.

19:24.030 --> 19:28.230
I was coming by anyway to see
how the registrars were doing.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.717
I didn't exactly make
anyone's life easier,

19:30.743 --> 19:32.630
leaving you a consultant down.

19:32.670 --> 19:33.876
It's fine.

19:33.902 --> 19:35.245
We understand.

19:35.510 --> 19:38.225
Well, you can put me back on the rota.

19:39.332 --> 19:41.216
You're coming back to work?

19:42.750 --> 19:45.825
I thought it would help me
get my head straight.

19:46.490 --> 19:49.250
The accusation. It shook me.

19:50.270 --> 19:54.480
Something like that it's not
something you can control, is it?

19:55.710 --> 19:57.658
And I don't like that feeling.

19:58.350 --> 20:01.230
That I'm somehow not in
charge of my own fate.

20:01.270 --> 20:03.466
That I'm being taken advantage of.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.648
But that's behind me.

20:05.822 --> 20:08.846
- The case is over?
- It is.

20:08.982 --> 20:11.102
I feel I can breathe again.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.190
Like I'm in control again.

20:14.393 --> 20:17.029
I'll be coming back
like I never went away.

20:17.870 --> 20:19.551
Stronger, if anything.

20:20.030 --> 20:24.252
After having gone through all this
and come out the other side.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.520
If you're sure?

20:28.550 --> 20:30.350
The job's important.

20:30.390 --> 20:32.251
And you know me, Margaret.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.062
If I want something,

20:34.088 --> 20:36.088
I won't let anything get in the way.

21:06.670 --> 21:07.870
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:07.910 --> 21:10.166
I can't accept these.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.950
I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to be...

21:14.075 --> 21:15.435
..you know.

21:15.710 --> 21:17.194
Apologies.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.426
Do you mind if I ask...

21:19.452 --> 21:21.852
Boyfriend or are you
just not interested?

21:22.929 --> 21:25.794
I'm just... I'm not in a place
for that kind of thing.

21:26.470 --> 21:29.030
- That's OK.
- So I can't accept them.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.087
- I'm sorry.
- Really, it's OK.

21:31.578 --> 21:33.885
- Stop saying it's OK.
- It's fine.

21:34.514 --> 21:36.190
That's the same thing.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.665
It really is fine.

21:40.159 --> 21:43.655
And again, apologies for going
a bit Milk Tray man on you there.

21:44.030 --> 21:47.390
Sending flowers to someone I've met
just once is not my usual move.

21:47.666 --> 21:49.430
It's not your fault.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.004
Anyway, I should probably pack.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.082
I went for a later flight,
so I could get a lie-in.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.012
Don't tell the office.

21:56.185 --> 21:58.065
Not that they'd care, but...

21:58.270 --> 22:00.350
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I'm still talking.

22:00.390 --> 22:01.630
I feel really awkward

22:01.670 --> 22:04.428
and I'm really not sure
how to play this, so...

22:06.537 --> 22:09.435
Any pointers
on where I might be going wrong?

22:11.779 --> 22:14.806
It's not you. Honestly. It's um...

22:16.047 --> 22:18.712
It's a shame we didn't meet months ago.

22:21.113 --> 22:23.113
Well, now I...

22:24.104 --> 22:28.596
I feel like I'm er... broken.

22:32.430 --> 22:36.470
I hope you find a way to
un-break yourself, Laura.

22:40.070 --> 22:41.990
Yeah.

22:53.070 --> 22:55.584
<i>Hi, this is Laura.
Please leave a message.</i>

22:56.150 --> 22:58.842
I heard you didn't
turn up for work today.

22:59.430 --> 23:01.511
Look, I'm worried.

23:01.950 --> 23:04.270
Just call me, please.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.830
Tom... What the hell are you doing here?

23:15.870 --> 23:18.750
It's fine. Liam's at his folks'
with the kids, right?

23:18.790 --> 23:20.510
That's the routine, isn't it?

23:20.550 --> 23:23.249
- Tom, you need to leave...
- I just want to talk.

23:40.601 --> 23:42.096
Have you been drinking?

23:43.311 --> 23:44.872
I got suspended.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.684
Turns out suspension and drinking
go well together.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.469
Why are you here?

23:51.990 --> 23:53.243
Why do you think?

23:53.624 --> 23:55.078
You should leave.

23:55.953 --> 23:58.140
- No, you don't mean that.
- I do.

23:58.552 --> 24:00.851
- Come on. I know you miss me.
- Tom, no.

24:04.150 --> 24:06.792
No, Tom. No more lying.

24:08.390 --> 24:10.910
I thought that's
what excited you. Isn't it?

24:20.530 --> 24:22.430
Get off.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.930
Maybe I should tell Liam.

24:26.570 --> 24:28.270
Maybe that's best for everybody.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.906
You wouldn't dare.

24:32.289 --> 24:33.984
I've got nothing to lose.

24:35.150 --> 24:36.853
Yeah, well, I have.

24:37.279 --> 24:38.962
What about my kids?

24:39.550 --> 24:42.070
It's going to burn my life down.

24:42.110 --> 24:43.754
Hey, love! We're back.

24:43.965 --> 24:45.719
We sneaked out early.

24:47.009 --> 24:49.878
Think Mum was knackered,
so just left her to it.

24:50.205 --> 24:52.055
- Hey.
- Tom.

24:52.912 --> 24:54.801
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

24:55.184 --> 24:56.424
Not really, mate.

24:56.450 --> 24:57.634
Tom.

24:57.923 --> 24:59.523
What's going on?

25:02.310 --> 25:03.430
Tom?

25:08.790 --> 25:10.150
Hey!

25:10.190 --> 25:11.790
There's my boy.

25:11.830 --> 25:13.590
Max, just give us a minute, yeah?

25:13.630 --> 25:15.310
It's fine.

25:15.350 --> 25:17.921
I just came to update Katy
on Laura's case, you know.

25:18.489 --> 25:20.312
I'm sure she can fill you in.

25:40.150 --> 25:41.270
Laura...

25:41.310 --> 25:44.800
Hi, Catherine. Are you ready to go?

25:44.969 --> 25:46.449
Er, something's come up.

25:46.475 --> 25:48.025
I can't come with you.

25:48.670 --> 25:50.990
Oh, OK.

25:51.030 --> 25:53.387
Sure, it was short notice. Um...

25:53.990 --> 25:55.910
We can just re-arrange, some other time.

25:55.950 --> 25:58.748
I'm sure first instance they
can talk on the phone anyway.

25:58.998 --> 26:00.591
I understand.

26:01.225 --> 26:05.145
I'm sorry. For everything
you've been through.

26:05.171 --> 26:06.610
I really am.

26:07.345 --> 26:09.013
But we're not the same.

26:10.430 --> 26:13.379
- What's going on?
- You know what he did to you.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.790
Me...

26:15.917 --> 26:17.397
I don't know.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.628
I just woke up with the guy one day.

26:20.190 --> 26:23.506
And then when I read your post,
maybe I just grabbed on to it

26:23.532 --> 26:25.520
cos I wanted to believe
that that was the truth.

26:26.630 --> 26:28.630
Cos it made me feel less guilty.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.561
And I just want to get on with my life.

26:32.929 --> 26:34.929
OK? Isn't that what everybody wants?

26:34.955 --> 26:37.769
What we want and what's right
aren't always the same thing.

26:38.074 --> 26:41.954
What you said earlier, you were
so sure. You read what I wrote.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.950
You know, I saw it in your eyes,
you know what he's capable of.

26:44.990 --> 26:46.459
So what's changed?

26:51.670 --> 26:53.426
She's been here, hasn't she?

26:54.570 --> 26:56.161
Mary's mum.

26:58.070 --> 27:01.470
Whatever she said, Catherine, it's
not your fault, what happened.

27:01.510 --> 27:03.830
- It's not.
- Don't you think she suffered enough?

27:03.870 --> 27:06.870
Do I have to take away her grandson
as well as her daughter?

27:06.910 --> 27:08.525
She's just scared, that's all.

27:09.075 --> 27:12.937
She wants to keep seeing Luke and
pretending her life isn't changed.

27:13.070 --> 27:15.590
She wants to believe
her daughter's marriage was happy

27:15.630 --> 27:18.229
because it's better than admitting
she did nothing to help her.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.499
And while she's burying
her head in the sand

27:20.524 --> 27:22.110
and you're going about your life,

27:22.150 --> 27:25.149
the man who raped the both of
us is walking around free,

27:25.175 --> 27:26.804
successful, happy,

27:26.830 --> 27:28.470
knowing he's done this twice,

27:28.510 --> 27:31.228
God knows how many more times,
and got away with it.

27:31.559 --> 27:33.270
How many women, Catherine?

27:33.310 --> 27:35.710
How many lives
are you going to let him ruin?

27:35.750 --> 27:37.190
I'm sorry.

27:37.230 --> 27:38.631
I'm so sorry.

27:56.110 --> 27:57.910
Sure I can't tempt you out for a drink?

27:57.950 --> 27:59.830
Oh, no. I'll fall asleep at the table.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.887
That's fine. It'll be like
going for dinner with my wife.

28:03.074 --> 28:04.791
Also, aren't you forgetting something?

28:04.816 --> 28:06.430
That is ridiculous.

28:06.462 --> 28:09.103
Natalie had two glasses
of wine every night

28:09.129 --> 28:10.564
when she was pregnant with Anna.

28:10.598 --> 28:12.140
Didn't do her any harm.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.232
Apart from the three arms.

28:15.390 --> 28:18.070
You wonder why your wife falls
asleep at the table with you?

28:18.110 --> 28:20.030
See? You'd be giving all this up.

28:21.630 --> 28:23.790
Sorry, Rory, I have been
thinking about it.

28:23.830 --> 28:26.750
No, no, don't let stains
like Andrew Earlham win.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.081
It's not just Andrew Earlham.

28:29.310 --> 28:31.390
Look, I want to be able to come home

28:31.565 --> 28:35.219
and say to my other half,
I've had a really good day.

28:35.470 --> 28:38.190
And for my kid to see that
and for them to want that too.

28:38.230 --> 28:40.311
Some days it works out
all right, though.

28:40.551 --> 28:43.006
Those are fewer
and further between. You know it.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.930
So...

28:48.350 --> 28:50.350
Crime training.

28:52.050 --> 28:53.550
Crime training.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.571
All right, then.

28:56.390 --> 28:58.270
Not going to try
and change my mind again?

28:58.310 --> 29:02.070
Oh, I will continue to try and change
your mind until the day you leave.

29:02.110 --> 29:03.510
But I'm done for tonight.

29:03.550 --> 29:05.550
Get out...

29:06.506 --> 29:08.506
- See you.
- See you.

29:32.710 --> 29:35.750
<i>..take wing from their
southerly migration spots</i>

29:35.790 --> 29:38.419
<i>and wend their way
back across the Channel,</i>

29:38.870 --> 29:43.062
<i>returning here to nest on the
rocky outposts of Alderney.</i>

29:44.070 --> 29:48.790
<i>These craggy rock formations
are home to thousands of gannets</i>

29:48.830 --> 29:51.469
<i>freshly settled
from their winter migration.</i>

29:52.130 --> 29:55.350
<i>Their elaborate courting rituals
are well-known.</i>

29:57.110 --> 30:00.790
<i>Once paired, they remain together
for several seasons.</i>

30:00.830 --> 30:03.350
<i>The first arrivals
are seen in late December.</i>

30:03.390 --> 30:05.910
<i>The rocks of Ortac and Les Etacs</i>

30:05.950 --> 30:09.590
<i>filling with over 8,000 pairs.</i>

30:10.670 --> 30:15.830
<i>Soon the nesting birds
will be joined by puffins.</i>

30:19.630 --> 30:22.150
<i>It doesn't sound like
you were watching PMQs.</i>

30:22.190 --> 30:24.910
<i>This sounds a lot more like Teletubbies.</i>

30:27.550 --> 30:29.910
<i>We've got to move on.
That's enough of that.</i>

30:29.950 --> 30:31.670
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, very excited.</i>

30:31.710 --> 30:33.910
<i>I've got my very own version of PMQs.</i>

30:33.950 --> 30:36.830
<i>It's called Truth Or Dare.</i>

30:36.870 --> 30:38.310
<i>Ooh!</i>

30:38.350 --> 30:40.230
<i>I'm sure you've all heard of this game.</i>

30:40.270 --> 30:42.870
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
in fact we have sexy rounds of this</i>

30:42.910 --> 30:46.270
<i>sweeping the board across
university campuses nationwide.</i>

30:46.310 --> 30:48.897
<i>But tonight we are going
to play, I assure you,</i>

30:48.923 --> 30:50.800
<i>a very clean version of that game</i>

30:50.826 --> 30:53.066
<i>with our celebrity guests.</i>

30:53.092 --> 30:56.132
<i>Now, our guests will
have to answer truthfully</i>

30:56.158 --> 30:58.358
<i>as you the audience
will be asked to cheer...</i>

32:55.130 --> 32:56.472
Hey.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.170
Hey.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.650
Are you following me?

33:01.690 --> 33:03.610
This is weird.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.730
I mean, not weird, since
we're both flying home but...

33:07.870 --> 33:11.039
- I'm sorry, I'll find somewhere else...
- No, it's fine. You can sit down.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.290
- You sure?
- Yeah, sure.

33:23.570 --> 33:28.250
Did you really get a later flight
just so you could have a lie-in?

33:28.290 --> 33:30.290
What can I say, I'm a very lazy man.

33:36.050 --> 33:37.935
I'm sorry about back at the hotel.

33:38.163 --> 33:39.584
It's fine.

33:40.088 --> 33:41.732
It's not.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.890
Have you ever had something
happen to you

33:47.930 --> 33:52.530
and you know you sort of think
of the world as being one way

33:52.570 --> 33:53.753
and then...

33:55.257 --> 33:57.617
something happens and...

33:57.810 --> 34:00.049
..you wake up different and...

34:00.370 --> 34:03.890
suddenly you don't know
what's important any more.

34:04.450 --> 34:07.250
You wonder why you bother to
get up in the morning, get dressed

34:07.290 --> 34:09.909
and do the same old thing
day in, day out.

34:14.489 --> 34:15.800
Sorry.

34:16.659 --> 34:18.527
I'm not making much sense.

34:19.731 --> 34:21.170
It's OK.

34:27.050 --> 34:28.850
I'm afraid.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.730
I'm afraid all the time.

34:34.810 --> 34:37.449
I've changed and I don't know
how to change back.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.630
Well, maybe you don't have to.

34:44.810 --> 34:48.130
Maybe you just have to learn
how to live with how you are now.

34:50.530 --> 34:53.027
Said the man who you don't know.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.020
I'm sorry.
That's probably not very helpful.

34:58.070 --> 35:00.210
Actually, it is.

35:00.850 --> 35:04.210
<i>Would passengers for British
Airways flight 105</i>

35:04.250 --> 35:08.050
<i>please note that check-in will close
in approximately 15 minutes.</i>

35:09.675 --> 35:13.355
Right. They're playing my song.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.666
Good luck to you.

35:19.956 --> 35:21.440
Thanks.

35:22.545 --> 35:24.045
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:06.610 --> 37:09.010
- What the hell...?
- I got your letter.

37:09.050 --> 37:10.530
Your lawyer's letter.

37:10.570 --> 37:13.170
- Look, this isn't the place, all right?
- You're suing me?

37:13.210 --> 37:16.655
You're suing me?
You dare, you bloody dare!

37:17.090 --> 37:19.930
Your wild accusations are defamatory.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.784
People read what you've said.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.610
Friends, teachers,
pupils at Luke's school.

37:25.650 --> 37:28.490
No. No, you don't get to
do this to me twice.

37:28.530 --> 37:30.810
You raped me, Andrew!

37:30.836 --> 37:33.836
And now you want to silence
me too? You won't.

37:33.862 --> 37:36.900
I will not... I won't keep quiet
about what you've done!

37:37.690 --> 37:41.918
Look, the terms of the
letter are very clear.

37:42.410 --> 37:46.835
A public post acknowledging
your error, or I will sue you.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.680
Right now, this doesn't
have to go any further.

37:50.473 --> 37:54.768
Abide by the terms we've set out
or I'll have to take action.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.050
I know, I know...

37:57.090 --> 37:59.795
I know why your wife killed herself.

38:01.190 --> 38:04.510
She found out what you did
to Catherine McAulay, didn't she?

38:05.474 --> 38:10.174
She couldn't bear to live with
someone like you any longer.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.530
You should be running along now,
shouldn't you?

38:16.570 --> 38:18.026
It's getting late.

38:19.084 --> 38:21.978
A nice woman like yourself
shouldn't be out on her own.

38:22.370 --> 38:24.127
Not at this time of night.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.024
_

39:47.126 --> 39:49.367
_

40:34.050 --> 40:36.921
You can say what you want.
You're allowed to say what happened.

40:38.358 --> 40:40.370
Look, you need to report him.

40:40.410 --> 40:42.690
What were you thinking,
going to his house?

40:42.730 --> 40:44.817
I wasn't thinking, OK? I just... I...

40:45.570 --> 40:48.450
I got that letter and I...
I wasn't thinking.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.930
- He could have...
- I know, I know.

40:49.970 --> 40:51.250
This is crap.

40:51.290 --> 40:53.890
OK? He can't sue you. He can't
go round threatening you.

40:53.930 --> 40:56.210
It's a free country, isn't it?

40:56.250 --> 40:59.530
Him hiring some fancy lawyer doesn't
buy him the right to shut you up.

40:59.570 --> 41:00.770
Liam...

41:00.810 --> 41:02.331
OK, love.

41:04.470 --> 41:05.990
I'm sorry.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.530
I'm going to go and check on the kids.

41:17.890 --> 41:20.892
Have you ever thought about
moving schools?

41:21.650 --> 41:23.323
You're joking.

41:23.970 --> 41:26.392
You could have your pick,
go anywhere you want.

41:26.890 --> 41:29.386
Why should I pack up my life
and let him win?

41:29.970 --> 41:32.711
Because life isn't always about winning.

41:33.274 --> 41:35.130
It's about looking after yourself.

41:35.170 --> 41:37.015
You really think I'm that bad?

41:40.330 --> 41:42.604
Do you remember that Christmas

41:42.630 --> 41:46.250
- we spent at Aunt Rachel's?
- Mm.

41:46.290 --> 41:48.170
We all played Monopoly and you lost.

41:48.210 --> 41:49.450
I was seven...

41:49.490 --> 41:53.210
And you made us play it again and
again while our dinner got cold

41:53.250 --> 41:55.170
until you finally won.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.303
You had to win fair and square.

41:57.570 --> 41:59.010
I've changed.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.756
No, you haven't.

42:02.410 --> 42:04.810
Most people see an obstacle
and they slow down

42:04.850 --> 42:08.210
and take their time to work out
how to get past it.

42:09.290 --> 42:11.630
You... You...

42:12.225 --> 42:14.225
run towards it even faster.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.390
You never give up, Laura,

42:18.069 --> 42:20.072
and I admire that about you but...

42:21.319 --> 42:26.450
there are times when walking away
is the smart thing to do.

42:34.210 --> 42:36.210
Maybe I'm just not that smart.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.807
Think about it.

42:40.170 --> 42:41.987
Please think about it.

42:43.530 --> 42:44.781
OK.

42:49.270 --> 42:50.970
I should go.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.850
Thanks.

42:58.110 --> 42:59.510
I love you.

43:02.050 --> 43:03.650
Love you too.

43:11.348 --> 43:13.175
I'll call you tomorrow.

43:43.610 --> 43:44.789
Hey.

43:45.503 --> 43:46.903
You all right?

43:47.170 --> 43:49.062
Thanks for meeting me out here.

43:49.412 --> 43:51.160
I never did see the appeal.

43:52.090 --> 43:53.537
It's peaceful.

43:53.892 --> 43:55.292
Yeah, and freezing.

43:55.519 --> 43:57.310
Come on. The car's a lot warmer.

43:59.528 --> 44:01.015
Did you bring it?

44:02.610 --> 44:05.667
I was going to give you a big
speech about trusting the system.

44:06.090 --> 44:08.467
We have laws for a reason.
That kind of stuff.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.105
But?

44:11.690 --> 44:13.793
But we both know I don't believe that.

44:14.490 --> 44:15.983
I brought it.

44:33.292 --> 44:36.372
- Are you sure about this?
- I wouldn't have asked you if I wasn't.

44:37.850 --> 44:40.070
Are you going to tell me what
you're planning to do with it?

44:41.010 --> 44:42.910
Maybe it's best you don't know.

44:46.570 --> 44:48.450
I just bought GHB.

44:48.476 --> 44:50.169
I'm already involved.

44:50.677 --> 44:52.277
So tell me.
