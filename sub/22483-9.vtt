08:38.500 --> 08:40.291
Excuse me. (screeching)

08:40.375 --> 08:41.417
(chomping)

08:41.500 --> 08:43.000
(burps)

08:43.083 --> 08:45.083
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.709
See, the sad truth is,

08:46.792 --> 08:49.458
some couples just aren't
able to have an egg.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.375
But you have options,
like IVF,

08:51.458 --> 08:54.208
which can be difficult
and heartbreaking.

08:54.291 --> 08:58.041
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.417
(squeaks)
Excuse me, Dr. Hootstein,

09:00.500 --> 09:01.875
have you seen my wife?

09:01.959 --> 09:04.500
(gulps) No.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.333
Is he gone?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.375
COLLEEN:
<i>After a long walk back to the barn,</i>

09:10.458 --> 09:12.000
<i>Chickaleen and Matt-A-Doodle-Do</i>

09:12.083 --> 09:13.709
<i>decided they didn't want</i>
<i>to go through all that</i>

09:13.792 --> 09:15.625
<i>and risk still having</i>
<i>their hearts broken.</i>

09:15.709 --> 09:16.875
<i>The end.</i>

09:16.959 --> 09:18.625
"The end"?

09:18.709 --> 09:19.750
The end.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.667
But that's so sad.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.041
It's not sad, it's just reality.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.333
Which is sad.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.291
But they're okay with it.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.000
I mean, Chickaleen
still cries sometimes

09:30.083 --> 09:31.458
when she's alone.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.417
You do? I didn't know that.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.709
Just a little.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.625
Like any time I see a baby.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.792
(voice breaking):
Or a family. Or right now.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.375
Oh, honey, we said we were
gonna stop trying

09:40.458 --> 09:42.166
because we didn't want
to have our hearts broken,

09:42.250 --> 09:43.667
but if our hearts
are broken anyway,

09:43.750 --> 09:44.709
then what's the point?

09:44.792 --> 09:45.917
Your heart's broken, too?

09:46.000 --> 09:46.959
Of course it is.

09:47.041 --> 09:48.208
I mean,
once I stopped panicking

09:48.291 --> 09:50.083
because we were
gonna have a family,

09:50.166 --> 09:52.083
I started panicking because
we <i>weren't </i>gonna have one.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.166
Matt, if you feel this way,
too, then...

09:55.250 --> 09:57.542
I say we just go for it.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.000
No matter what it takes.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.709
Okay.

10:00.792 --> 10:01.834
Okay?

10:01.917 --> 10:03.667
-Yeah.
-(laughs softly)

10:07.834 --> 10:09.667
Okay, you don't need
tongues to make a baby.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.083
I know that much.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.625
Carla, huh?

10:20.709 --> 10:21.750
That's a lot of clip art

10:21.834 --> 10:23.625
for a nursing résumé.
I say pass.

10:23.709 --> 10:25.333
(sighs)

10:25.417 --> 10:26.834
Okay. (scoffs) Come on.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.583
This one took 19 years

10:28.667 --> 10:30.333
to finish nursing school.
Uh-uh.

10:30.417 --> 10:31.583
Now, just stay out of it.

10:31.667 --> 10:32.625
All right, this is my nurse.

10:32.709 --> 10:33.667
I will make the decision.

10:33.750 --> 10:34.709
You don't want my help?

10:34.792 --> 10:35.834
No! I don't.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.208
You make all of our decisions.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.458
I never get to make any.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.291
Yeah, Tim,
because I am really awesome

10:40.375 --> 10:41.959
at making decisions.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.500
Hey, just ask that pillow
that you're laying on,

10:44.583 --> 10:47.083
which you said is exactly
like sleeping on a boob.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.709
Well, these are not pillows
or boobs, okay.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.500
This is my kingdom.

10:51.583 --> 10:52.625
Who do you want?

10:52.709 --> 10:55.291
I am going to hire Mindy.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.125
-That's right.
-You sure you want to hire Mindy?

10:57.208 --> 10:59.333
Yes. Mindy. No, wait,
no, no, no, no, no.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.417
No, not Mindy. Cindy!
I said Cindy.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.458
-Cindy. Cindy.
-See? Cindy.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.333
You want to know what
I think about Cindy?

11:06.417 --> 11:08.291
-Nope. 'Cause I already know
everything about Cindy.
-No?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.959
Cindy is yay tall,
Polynesian,

11:11.041 --> 11:13.583
short black hair,
<i>Looney Tunes </i>scrubs.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.875
Cindy. My gal. Love her.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.709
I am so excited
about working here.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.333
Thank you for this opportunity.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.166
You're Cindy?
You're not Cindy.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.583
Good one, Dr. Hughes.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.417
I knew you were funny
when we first met.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.000
Especially when you pretended to
fall asleep during my interview.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.542
-So we have met before?
-Yes.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.166
-And you looked exactly like you do now?
-Yeah.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.458
As I told you in my interview,
magic is my hobby,

11:35.542 --> 11:37.250
but I wouldn't trick you
on my first day.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.000
Or would I? Ah!

11:39.083 --> 11:41.291
-Uh, I don't know.
-Mm.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.500
-Okay. Well, hey, welcome.
-All right...

11:43.583 --> 11:44.834
-It's good to have you, Cindy.
-Yep.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.917
That's you. You're Cindy.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.542
Heather, you screwed me up!
I hired Cindy,

11:49.625 --> 11:51.125
and I meant to hire Mindy!

11:51.208 --> 11:52.375
Oh, Cindy was my favorite.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.291
She's fantastic.
She does magic.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.917
No, she's awful!

11:56.000 --> 11:57.667
I-I wrote a prescription,
and she ripped it

11:57.750 --> 12:00.500
into a million pieces, and then
she made it go back together

12:00.583 --> 12:03.333
by blowing on it,
and that is unsanitary.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.792
That's fun. You love magic.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.250
Not anymore, I don't.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.709
Look, you should not have
been meddling

12:08.792 --> 12:10.291
in my decision.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.000
Now, I've hired this girl,
and I'm stuck with her.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.250
She's gonna be great, just like

12:13.333 --> 12:14.709
every other decision
that I've made.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.875
You know what,
ask that underwear I bought you

12:16.959 --> 12:20.000
that you said is like
not wearing underwear.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.917
I can't ask underwear, Heather.
It can't talk.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.750
Unlike the pair I wanted to buy.

12:27.834 --> 12:28.917
Not so fast, Doc.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.166
I went ahead and
updated these files,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.166
so they're all up
to the minute.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.375
And Mr. Kotkin has been
weighed and measured.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.542
So am I actually ahead
of schedule today?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.375
You are. You can take
an early lunch.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.875
-Heh.
-As long as you have money for the cafe.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.417
-Chocolate?
-Yeah.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.041
That's even better
than real money!

12:45.125 --> 12:46.834
Oh, I can do it with noses
and throats, too.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.917
Well, you keep this up,
and I'll be pulling a raise

12:49.000 --> 12:49.959
out of your ear.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.291
-(both laughing)
-Oh, stop.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.625
Ah, great to see you, Mike.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.208
We'll, uh, call in
that prescription,

12:55.291 --> 12:57.041
and Cindy will get you
your samples.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.166
Already got 'em.
Here you go, Mr. Kotkin.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.333
-Wow.
-So, I'll just validate your parking,

13:00.417 --> 13:01.417
and you'll be good to go.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.542
Okay.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.000
Ooh, you're gonna love this.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.875
-Kind of need that.
-Bah!

13:09.417 --> 13:10.583
TIM:
Oh.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.875
I thought you were
gonna make it

13:11.959 --> 13:13.083
go back together again.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.166
-Back together like this?
-(shrieks)

13:15.250 --> 13:17.083
Ha! Are you...

13:17.166 --> 13:19.458
-(laughing)
-Thank you.

13:19.542 --> 13:23.083
That is why I very purposefully
hired this specific Cindy.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.125
Oh. Thank you.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.458
Mm.

13:25.542 --> 13:28.625
-No orange?
-Hey, honey. I'm here.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.083
I was able to make a decision

13:30.166 --> 13:32.125
about where to park my car.

13:32.208 --> 13:35.417
And I also managed to draw
a big wiener on yours.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.583
-Thank you. Look I, um...
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.166
I asked you to come in because I
want to take you out to dinner.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.625
You were right, and I'm sorry.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.875
-I'm sorry, what's that?
-I said, you were right.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.041
-Right.
-I'm sorry. Cindy is great.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.041
She's the perfect nurse,
and you knew it all along.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.166
So I need to start
including you in my decisions,

13:51.250 --> 13:52.709
because you make good ones.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.291
Like naming our daughter Sophia

13:54.375 --> 13:57.375
instead of what I wanted
to name her-- Pantera.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.792
Thank you.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.917
And I'm going to make sure
to wait until you ask me

14:02.000 --> 14:05.166
before I meddle in
your business uninvited.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.417
Hey.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.458
All right. Thanks.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.500
-TIM: Oh, Cindy.
-HEATHER: Oh!

14:10.583 --> 14:12.166
This is my wife, Heather,
the other woman in my life

14:12.250 --> 14:13.750
who makes me wash my hands.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.417
Oh, Cindy,
it is so great to meet you.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.208
-Nice to meet you.
-We're off to dinner,

14:17.291 --> 14:19.583
-so I'm gonna go put on my eating pants.
-Okay.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.709
I knew you were gonna be great.
You were my first choice.

14:21.792 --> 14:22.875
Oh, what do you mean?

14:22.959 --> 14:24.875
Tim-- you know, funny story--

14:24.959 --> 14:28.333
he actually meant
to hire someone else.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.375
-(chuckles)
-He did?

14:30.458 --> 14:33.250
I mean,
that-that's the funny part.

14:33.333 --> 14:37.083
He-he hired you accidentally,

14:37.166 --> 14:40.583
but now, I mean, here you are,
and he couldn't be happier.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.250
Right? I mean,
isn't it fantastic to...

14:42.333 --> 14:44.000
(stammers)
What are you doing, Cindy?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.041
Quitting.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.208
Why?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.792
I don't want to work for a boss

14:47.875 --> 14:49.625
who didn't want to hire me
in the first place.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.542
You can tell your husband that
my resignation letter will be

14:51.625 --> 14:53.000
inside one of the oranges
in the break room.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.959
How do you get the letter
in the orange?

14:56.041 --> 14:57.834
A magician never tells.

14:57.917 --> 14:59.834
(quietly):
No.

14:59.917 --> 15:01.417
(door opens, closes)

15:01.500 --> 15:04.083
Hey, babe, what do you think
if we invite Cindy? Wha...

15:04.166 --> 15:05.208
Where is Cindy?

15:05.291 --> 15:07.875
(gasps) Did she do
her disappearing act?

15:07.959 --> 15:09.458
Yeah.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.125
Sure. Could you,

15:11.208 --> 15:13.667
um, grab me an orange
from the break room?

15:13.750 --> 15:15.125
If there's one
that's just, like,

15:15.208 --> 15:16.458
right on top of the pile,
just...

15:16.542 --> 15:17.959
I want to put it in my purse.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
(dog barking in distance)

15:25.458 --> 15:26.625
LARK:
Mommy!

15:26.709 --> 15:29.125
No. I heard "Dad."

15:29.208 --> 15:32.125
This stupid dog. Every morning.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.750
Where does that thing even live?

15:33.834 --> 15:36.417
(groans) In our nightmares.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.417
Must be the new neighbors.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.333
You want to go over there
and find out?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.667
Mm? Yeah, sure, I'll-I'll deal
with the neighbors,

15:42.750 --> 15:44.291
and you can take Lark.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.709
(sighs)

15:45.792 --> 15:47.917
Well, come on, Jen,
what are you doing?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.333
(groggily):
I'm meeting the new neighbors.

15:54.458 --> 15:55.417
Hi!

15:55.500 --> 15:56.542
-Hi.
-Uh, we just wanted

15:56.625 --> 15:57.583
to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.083
We're the Shorts,
from over there.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.500
Jen and Greg.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.333
-Oh! Hi!
-Oh! Well, nice to meet you, the Shorts.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.792
-We are the Longs.
-Oh.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.792
Just kidding.
That would be ridiculous. No.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.458
We're the Jazzelroys.

16:08.542 --> 16:09.500
I'm Finn. This is Dianna.

16:09.583 --> 16:10.917
We don't have children.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.542
But, you know, by choice.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.000
Cool. Uh, we brought
you these. (chuckles)

16:16.083 --> 16:18.917
Mmm. Jen, I am freaking out.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.542
These are so good.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.333
Oh, thank you. Yeah,
you want to know the secret?

16:22.417 --> 16:25.500
They're store-bought, and then
I covered them in plastic wrap.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.625
-(laughing)
-Yeah.

16:26.709 --> 16:27.750
It's a lot of work.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.709
Yeah, uh, be careful though.

16:29.792 --> 16:32.125
'Cause they're chocolate. And,
you know, if a dog will eat it,

16:32.208 --> 16:34.750
-the dog will then die, so...
-(Finn clears throat)

16:34.834 --> 16:36.166
You guys don't have a dog,
do you?

16:36.250 --> 16:37.709
-(quietly): Very smooth.
-Thank you.

16:37.792 --> 16:38.875
-No.
-No.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.041
But, sometimes it feels
like we do

16:41.125 --> 16:43.417
because of that annoying
dog nearby.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.625
The barking one.

16:44.709 --> 16:45.834
Yes! You know of it?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.333
Know of it? I hate of it!

16:47.417 --> 16:49.166
It's driving us insane.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.834
Us, too. You know,
it's really interfering

16:50.917 --> 16:53.166
with our binge-watching.
Right now, I'm really into

16:53.250 --> 16:56.000
this show about people
who regret their nose jobs.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.083
<i>A Little Off the Nose?</i>

16:57.166 --> 16:58.125
-Yes!
-Yeah.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.291
I love that show!

17:00.375 --> 17:03.333
Um, what are you guys
doing on Saturday?

17:03.417 --> 17:04.792
-Finn has this thing where
he gets really into hobbies
-Yes.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.291
and then, like, loses interest.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.875
But right now,
he's all about smoking meats.

17:08.959 --> 17:12.208
Um, Greg is fly-fishing
in the morning,

17:12.291 --> 17:13.750
-but I think we're free after that.
-Well-well,

17:13.834 --> 17:15.417
that-- no, that was,
that was last week.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.208
-Oh.
-This week was gonna be
about raising awareness

17:17.291 --> 17:19.750
-about the dangers of
fly-fishing. But who cares?
-Right.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.500
Then we'll rub
the pork butt tonight,

17:21.583 --> 17:23.417
and then we'll slaughter
that pig tomorrow.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.083
-(Dianna laughs)
-(chuckles) Yeah.
You know, that's very funny.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.000
I-I have made that
exact same joke before.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.875
Yeah. More than once. Yeah.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.709
-Oh, no, I'm so stuffed.
-Mm. Mm-mm.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.834
I don't think I can eat
another bite.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.208
Don't worry,
we always wrap up the extras

17:36.291 --> 17:37.583
and take it to the shelter.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.709
Oh. Yeah, we do the same thing,
except throw it away.

17:40.792 --> 17:41.750
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

17:41.834 --> 17:42.959
-Eh.
-GREG: Yeah.

17:43.041 --> 17:44.917
-(dog barking)
-Oh! There it is again.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.667
You know, we found out
it lives in the house

17:46.750 --> 17:48.041
on the other side of us.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.792
-The other side.
-The other side.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.625
It's always the last place
you look.

17:51.709 --> 17:52.750
Well, okay,

17:52.834 --> 17:54.500
this may just be
the tequila talking,

17:54.583 --> 17:56.417
but, Finn, what do you say
you and I go over there

17:56.500 --> 17:58.709
-and we just, you know,
handle the situation, huh?
-Oh.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.542
Okay. I'll just say this.
When the tequila talks to me,

18:01.625 --> 18:03.375
-someone's not happy.
-(all laugh)

18:03.458 --> 18:05.375
Head over the toilet. (groans)

18:05.458 --> 18:07.250
Uh, I'm down with this,
I totally support it.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.375
You guys go confront that,
and we will stay here

18:09.458 --> 18:12.875
-and confront the rest
of this, uh, <i>vino blanco.</i>
-Ah.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.917
-Cheers.
-Ah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.542
Do you mind
if I take lead on this?

18:16.625 --> 18:17.959
I'm kind of a people person.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.166
Hey, you're the captain.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.667
I'm just a stowaway
on this boat.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.709
(dog barking)

18:21.792 --> 18:23.458
WOMAN:
Quiet down, Lilac.

18:24.583 --> 18:25.750
-Oh.
-Oh, hello there, ma'am.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.500
I hope you're having
a blessed day...

18:27.583 --> 18:29.083
Listen up, bitch!

18:29.166 --> 18:31.125
If you don't shut
your freaking dog up,

18:31.208 --> 18:33.709
then we're gonna
shut it up forever!

18:33.792 --> 18:36.834
But my Lilac is a,
is a seizure alert dog.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.542
Well, Lilac is gonna alert you
when she's dead.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.750
If that dog barks
one more time,

18:41.834 --> 18:44.417
we will tear it apart!

18:44.500 --> 18:46.917
Can you hear me?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.709
I think that went good.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.041
We're a good team.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.500
-Also, such a sweet lady.
-Uh-huh.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.333
God, your hair smells awesome.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.959
Is that coconut?

18:56.041 --> 18:57.792
(laughs)

18:57.875 --> 18:59.291
Thank you so much.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.375
And we cannot wait to
go to your ski house.

19:01.458 --> 19:02.500
-Oh.
-Oh, just so you know though,

19:02.583 --> 19:03.875
it's a ski-in, ski-out.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.792
Ski-in, ski-out!

19:05.875 --> 19:07.125
But I hope you're not allergic
to hot tubs.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.917
-(gasps, laughs)
-Thank you.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.917
Well,
don't you want to tell them

19:11.000 --> 19:13.625
-about the-the snowboard you made?
-Oh.

19:13.709 --> 19:14.875
It-it's just some,
just some old plywood, really.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.125
It's a-- whatever.

19:17.208 --> 19:20.583
Brother, I would love
to see that snowboard.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.458
You can have it.

19:22.542 --> 19:23.500
Okay.

19:23.583 --> 19:24.625
Bye.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.500
Greg, what is wrong with you?

19:28.583 --> 19:31.208
Jen, that guy's a lunatic.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.250
He threatened to kill
that old lady's dog.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.083
Okay, well, let's not overreact

19:35.166 --> 19:37.583
until we see
how nice their ski house is.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.250
-What?
-Come on, they give
to a homeless shelter.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.208
Doesn't that balance things out?

19:41.291 --> 19:44.458
-No.
-It's ski-in, ski-out, Greg.

19:44.542 --> 19:47.291
I want to feel
the wind in my hair.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.333
-Hi. Hi-- oh!
One second, please.
-(gasps)

19:57.417 --> 19:59.625
I had no idea our neighbor
was gonna say those things.

19:59.709 --> 20:00.875
I am so sorry.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.125
Yeah, so, uh...

20:02.208 --> 20:03.667
I got these for you.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.709
FINN:
Hey, Greg.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.125
What you doing over there?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.792
Uh...

20:15.875 --> 20:18.000
I was just, uh...

20:18.083 --> 20:21.125
giving the old lady some flowers
for her funeral.

20:21.208 --> 20:24.458
Telling her, if things don't
change around here, you know...

20:24.542 --> 20:27.834
You're not, uh...

20:27.917 --> 20:29.667
lying to me, are you, Greg?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.750
I'm not lying.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.750
I am not lying to you. No.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.750
Absolutely n-no.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.667
I-- what's that, Jen?

20:38.750 --> 20:40.834
I-I'll be right home!

20:40.917 --> 20:42.125
Got to...

20:42.208 --> 20:43.542
All right, see you, bud.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.583
Tell Jen hi for me.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.291
Uh-huh.
