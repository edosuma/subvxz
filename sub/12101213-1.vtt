00:22.590 --> 00:24.559
Ever since I was a little girl,

00:24.592 --> 00:27.529
I had a dream.

00:27.562 --> 00:30.163
One day I'd become the superhero

00:30.197 --> 00:33.668
in my very own fairy tale.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.671
I can fly, be invisible,

00:36.704 --> 00:38.540
and at the end,

00:38.573 --> 00:40.240
save the world.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.215
Funny thing is,

00:48.248 --> 00:51.485
sometimes you have to be careful
what you wish for,

00:51.519 --> 00:54.187
'cause one day,
it may come true.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.598
Hurry up!

02:46.501 --> 02:47.702
Hey!

03:09.791 --> 03:12.627
I don't remember the flight,

03:12.660 --> 03:15.530
just the feeling.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.766
It was like going on the
scariest ride in a theme park.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.871
Thinking you're going to die.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.922
I had to help them.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.960
And I had to do it fast.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.818
Hello?

04:10.852 --> 04:13.788
Dean, get your ticket
and come home now.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.689
Bye.

04:23.598 --> 04:26.601
Paging Dr. Stateman,
Dr. Stateman, please.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.888
Thank God she was okay.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.695
A handful of small cuts
and bruises

04:54.729 --> 04:57.397
felt like the greatest victory
in the world.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.875
We beat the unthinkable.

05:17.919 --> 05:19.687
And I,

05:19.720 --> 05:22.422
I almost lost my best friends.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.805
What was I thinking
going on that road?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.151
How in the world
did we come out of this?

05:55.189 --> 05:59.594
I had this strange feeling
inside of me.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.864
It was like I was given a second
chance to make things right.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.471
And then all of a sudden,
it hit me.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.911
What if...

06:16.944 --> 06:20.615
this is my moment?

06:20.648 --> 06:22.683
My chance to become
the superhero

06:22.717 --> 06:24.585
I always dreamed about.

06:26.087 --> 06:28.789
All I have to do

06:28.823 --> 06:30.992
is figure out
how to save the world.

06:32.927 --> 06:35.462
Okay, now,
thanks for coming, Terry.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.602
- Terry.
- Sylvia.

06:41.636 --> 06:43.537
Good to see you.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.107
This is our son Dean.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.743
- Terry Knight.
- Dean Goodwin.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.978
Can I get you a cup or coffee,
anything?

06:51.012 --> 06:53.748
No, no, no, I'm fine,
I only have a minute.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.182
Okay.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.820
Ah...

06:59.854 --> 07:02.056
I'm sorry, we just...

07:02.089 --> 07:05.226
we don't have any new
information yet.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.493
But we will.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.063
Did you talk to her friends?

07:09.096 --> 07:13.935
Of course, but we haven't, um,

07:13.968 --> 07:16.070
found her.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.610
We need something, Terry.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.079
Please, we need something.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.850
These kind of investigations
can take some time.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.687
It can be...

07:32.720 --> 07:37.058
difficult to, uh...

07:37.091 --> 07:39.927
locate things.

07:39.961 --> 07:42.495
What kind of things?

07:47.668 --> 07:50.538
- Signs of life.
- Oh.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.107
- Oh, God.
- Yes, we'll...

07:53.140 --> 07:55.142
We'll find her,
we'll find her, right.

07:55.176 --> 07:58.713
Just let her be, let her be.

08:01.115 --> 08:03.751
Sign of life?

08:03.784 --> 08:06.520
I'll show you sign of life.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.267
Dad?

08:38.219 --> 08:41.589
Yeah, mhm, yeah.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.090
No, no, I'm with you.

08:43.124 --> 08:44.792
Let me have a chat with them
'cause I think it's...

08:44.825 --> 08:46.127
Dad.

08:47.862 --> 08:50.765
- Dad, are you home?
- I'm on the phone.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.704
Mhm, hang on a sec.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.339
Danni?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.907
Is that you?

09:02.109 --> 09:05.679
Yeah, uh...

09:05.713 --> 09:07.748
Hey, do you have a minute?

09:07.782 --> 09:09.183
Not today, pal.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.251
Got a red-eye to catch,

09:10.284 --> 09:13.020
have an early one in New York
tomorrow morning.

09:13.054 --> 09:15.189
Mrs. Lee is on the way over.

09:17.258 --> 09:19.894
You're not in trouble again,
are you, Danni?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.665
Yeah.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.233
Yeah what?

09:26.267 --> 09:28.035
I swear, if you are,
you're on your own.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.670
You hear me?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.105
Danni!

09:33.074 --> 09:34.341
I hear you.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.045
Get the door, will ya?

09:38.079 --> 09:39.613
Sorry about that,
no, don't worry.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.316
- It's nothing, just my kid.
- Love you too.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.723
What did he say?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.161
Nothing.

09:54.195 --> 09:56.697
Oh, he can ask but I can't?

09:59.300 --> 10:01.735
Sarah, I need you to talk to me.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.839
Please, do you wanna,
do you wanna go somewhere?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.373
No, I don't wanna go anywhere.

10:06.407 --> 10:09.243
Okay, well, will you please
talk to me?

10:12.246 --> 10:14.648
We hit a turn, the car flew
in the river, I don't know.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.952
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.822
Did Andre put you and Angie
up to this?

10:21.856 --> 10:25.726
The moment I saw this boy,
I knew he was up to no good.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.795
You should not be dating
a boy that...

10:27.828 --> 10:31.699
- Can you go now?
- Just give me the phone.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.867
- What did your father say?
- Nothing!

10:32.900 --> 10:36.337
He said because of my boyfriend
we're all now suspects!

10:36.370 --> 10:37.671
Sarah!

11:07.868 --> 11:10.004
How fast were they going?

11:11.472 --> 11:13.307
Over the speed limit.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.014
When was the last time
you talked to her?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.184
Two months ago.

11:23.217 --> 11:26.220
She was gonna come over
to visit.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.488
Did she?

11:27.522 --> 11:29.924
No.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.826
Nothing since?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.195
No.

11:36.430 --> 11:40.502
No letters, emails, texts?

11:40.535 --> 11:43.470
Deep secrets?

11:43.505 --> 11:46.874
No, we...

11:46.907 --> 11:49.977
respected each other's space.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.312
What does that mean?

11:54.114 --> 11:57.017
We weren't very close.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.452
Hm.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.824
See, I got a problem here.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.827
It's a three-person wreck

12:06.860 --> 12:09.430
and only two accounted for.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.067
We got search teams
in the woods around here

12:13.100 --> 12:15.836
in case she managed to walk away

12:15.869 --> 12:19.206
from the wreck, pass out.

12:19.240 --> 12:24.478
Dive teams in the river,
but, um...

12:24.512 --> 12:27.781
nothing yet.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.484
So, for now,

12:30.518 --> 12:33.320
it's a missing persons case.

12:33.354 --> 12:35.489
Suspicious circumstances.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.228
You know why
I'm telling you this?

12:41.262 --> 12:43.330
What, am I suspect?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.902
No, my daughter was in the car
with yours.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.475
Oh.

12:54.509 --> 12:56.176
Is she okay?

12:59.480 --> 13:02.449
Did you talk to her,
ask her what happened?

13:02.483 --> 13:04.218
- I did.
- And?

13:08.122 --> 13:10.457
Our relationship
is a bit like yours.

13:10.491 --> 13:13.294
We, uh,

13:13.327 --> 13:16.196
respect each other's space.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.398
Hey, Terry.

13:17.431 --> 13:19.166
Can you come down here
for a sec?

13:25.507 --> 13:27.274
You know what he's gonna
tell me, don't ya?

13:29.644 --> 13:33.113
I'm not supposed to be here.

13:33.147 --> 13:35.149
I'm sure you can understand why.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.298
Angie?

15:11.211 --> 15:13.013
Selena.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.717
Yes?

15:15.750 --> 15:19.286
After I said no, behind my back,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.955
you still sent in
the application.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.957
Dad, do you know
how many kids get chances

15:23.991 --> 15:25.627
- at something like this?
- No!

15:25.660 --> 15:29.463
I will not have my daughter
waste four years of her life

15:29.496 --> 15:31.198
on some stupid thing
that will never pay off.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.301
Stupid, says who?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.303
Luis.

15:39.641 --> 15:41.576
You will not go
on this interview.

15:45.580 --> 15:48.382
And I will not hear about this
school in this house again.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.718
Is this clear?

15:55.523 --> 15:58.025
You're a monster, you know that?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.426
Selena.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.529
Come back here.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.769
Finish your dinner.

16:07.802 --> 16:09.671
Dad, Dad!

16:09.704 --> 16:12.072
You can't live my life
for me, okay?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.374
Hey, as long as I put a roof
over your head,

16:14.408 --> 16:16.644
food on your table,
and clothes on your body,

16:16.678 --> 16:21.048
you do not get a chance to say
what I can and cannot do.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
Is this clear?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.520
Crystal.

16:25.553 --> 16:27.589
Excuse me.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.192
Luis.

16:34.596 --> 16:37.732
Sonia, I know
what is best for her.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.301
You see, what is that?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.706
Selena.

16:44.739 --> 16:46.674
We do not slam doors
in this house.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.743
- The door is wide open.
- Then who did it?

16:48.776 --> 16:50.712
I don't know how did it, okay?

16:50.745 --> 16:52.514
A ghost did it.

16:52.547 --> 16:53.515
You do not talk to me like that.

16:53.548 --> 16:56.183
Because you don't believe
anything I say.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.785
It was the back door.

16:57.819 --> 17:00.320
The wind must have shut it.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.558
No, must have been me.

17:03.591 --> 17:05.292
Selena <i>por favor,</i> yeah.

17:05.325 --> 17:09.764
Luis, enough, please.

17:09.797 --> 17:13.835
Have you ever heard
of the word "respect?"

17:13.868 --> 17:16.103
Yeah.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.106
It goes very well
with the word "mutual."

17:31.653 --> 17:33.453
Goodnight.

17:44.464 --> 17:48.836
Your father always said this is
the best remedy for insomnia.

17:50.905 --> 17:53.140
Want some?

17:53.173 --> 17:56.878
No, thank you.

17:56.911 --> 18:00.414
Sort of feels like deja vu.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.348
When this happened to Katie,

18:01.381 --> 18:05.185
I was feeling the same feelings
I felt then.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.690
Well, your feelings are wrong,
she's alive.

18:08.723 --> 18:11.224
Oh, and you know that how?

18:11.258 --> 18:14.729
Did someone contact you?

18:14.762 --> 18:16.296
No.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.468
Well, she wouldn't.

18:21.502 --> 18:23.605
But the funny thing is,

18:23.638 --> 18:27.140
you're the closest by blood

18:27.174 --> 18:29.644
and the farthest by heart.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.380
So funny.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.182
Yeah, like you and me.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.157
Wait, I'm sorry.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.492
Come on.

18:45.526 --> 18:47.394
Come on back.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.665
Come sit down.

19:02.376 --> 19:04.211
I guess the last time
we saw each other

19:04.244 --> 19:06.480
we were sitting right here
in this room.

19:08.482 --> 19:11.418
What was that, five years ago?

19:13.955 --> 19:15.890
Did you find
what you were looking for

19:15.923 --> 19:18.291
all the way across the country?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.462
Are we really gonna
talk about this now?

19:22.496 --> 19:23.865
Never mind.

19:23.898 --> 19:27.434
I was just asking my son
a simple question.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.637
Fine.

19:29.671 --> 19:31.606
We can talk about it now.

19:31.639 --> 19:34.207
I mean, I know exactly
where this is going.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.911
My failed music career,

19:36.944 --> 19:41.248
my pathetic personal life, or...

19:41.281 --> 19:42.817
No, let me guess.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.753
The fact that I've turned
my back on my only child.

19:45.787 --> 19:47.822
You did.

19:47.855 --> 19:50.825
With your help.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.293
She chose it.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.662
I gave her a home,

19:54.696 --> 19:56.831
a place where she could grow

19:56.864 --> 19:59.266
and experience the world
in full color,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.536
like every child should.

20:01.569 --> 20:03.705
She went to a wonderful school
and she had good friends.

20:03.738 --> 20:06.708
Yeah, lots of expensive toys,
I get it.

20:06.741 --> 20:09.510
And how was I supposed to
compete with that?

20:09.544 --> 20:11.478
It's not about competition,
Dean.

20:11.512 --> 20:15.415
It's about the decisions
you make in life.

20:15.449 --> 20:17.852
Something you could never do.

20:20.855 --> 20:23.691
Doesn't look like she made the
right decision now, does it?

20:41.042 --> 20:44.444
That night that we were here,

20:44.478 --> 20:45.546
you played something.

20:45.580 --> 20:50.051
It was...

20:50.084 --> 20:53.386
It was quite...

20:53.420 --> 20:57.558
It was quite wonderful.

20:57.592 --> 21:01.529
I haven't written anything
since then.

21:01.562 --> 21:03.765
Do you remember it?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.670
I woke her up.

21:09.704 --> 21:12.372
Play it.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.809
But Dad's sleeping,
I don't wanna wake him up.

21:14.842 --> 21:17.277
No I'm not.

21:24.619 --> 21:26.888
Play it, please.

21:26.921 --> 21:28.823
Wake her up.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.712
Sylvia.

22:29.817 --> 22:31.484
Sylvia.

22:45.533 --> 22:46.801
Angie?

23:01.883 --> 23:04.886
My dearest Sylvia,

23:04.919 --> 23:07.121
I'm sure it's not easy
for you to read this,

23:07.154 --> 23:08.923
but believe me,

23:08.956 --> 23:12.059
writing this wasn't easy either.

23:12.093 --> 23:14.629
You once told me the moment

23:14.662 --> 23:17.064
you learn your true purpose
in life,

23:17.098 --> 23:21.068
destiny appears
at your doorstep.

23:21.102 --> 23:23.638
You were right.

23:23.671 --> 23:27.008
After the crash,
my destiny came calling.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.977
It said I have to save
the world.

23:30.011 --> 23:32.980
Very soon, when I finish
what I started,

23:33.014 --> 23:35.049
I'll come back home.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.118
You and Grandpa
will be very proud of me.

23:37.151 --> 23:39.220
- Sylvie?
- Mom?

23:39.253 --> 23:40.855
You all right?

23:45.159 --> 23:46.994
What are you doing?

23:49.196 --> 23:52.066
Her passport, it's not here.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.500
Okay, well, where is it?

23:53.534 --> 23:54.969
It's just not here.

23:55.002 --> 23:56.469
Are you sure?

23:56.504 --> 23:59.507
She always travels
with her passport, always.

23:59.540 --> 24:02.643
What were... somebody
would've called by now.

24:02.677 --> 24:06.113
All this time I've been thinking
that I'm going crazy,

24:06.147 --> 24:09.750
hearing voices
and seeing things.

24:11.152 --> 24:14.188
She's alive,

24:14.221 --> 24:16.991
she's alive.

24:24.065 --> 24:26.000
State police need your help
in locating

24:26.033 --> 24:27.902
a missing Gardenland teenager.

24:27.935 --> 24:29.603
Seventeen-year-old
Angelina Goodwin

24:29.637 --> 24:31.205
was last seen on Sunday.

24:31.238 --> 24:34.041
Goodwin has dark brown hair
and light brown eyes.

24:34.075 --> 24:38.713
She's 5'4" tall and weighs
between 110 and 118 pounds.

24:38.746 --> 24:39.847
She was last seen wearing

24:39.880 --> 24:42.016
a lavender dress
and a denim jacket.

24:42.049 --> 24:46.954
If you have any information,
please call 555-4745.

24:51.325 --> 24:53.127
Danni.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.135
Danni.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.007
- Boo!
- Ah!

25:09.143 --> 25:11.612
Are you done playing?

25:15.082 --> 25:17.752
Angie Goodwin?

25:17.785 --> 25:19.687
Danni Lin.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.756
I need you to do something.

25:21.789 --> 25:25.793
Go to the police
and tell them the truth.

25:25.826 --> 25:27.128
Me?

25:27.161 --> 25:30.064
You.

25:30.097 --> 25:31.999
Where are you?

25:32.033 --> 25:33.934
Right in front of you.

25:33.968 --> 25:36.871
- Inside the monkey?
- Boo!

25:41.842 --> 25:45.713
Every time I opened my eyes
and found myself in a new place,

25:45.746 --> 25:48.115
I felt like a fugitive
on the run.

25:55.089 --> 25:57.591
My wounds were healing quickly.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.361
I started having these dreams.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.997
I felt like
I was being followed.

26:19.413 --> 26:22.283
Why have a refrigerator
if you don't put food in it?

26:23.951 --> 26:25.386
No.

26:25.419 --> 26:28.222
I was no fugitive on the run.

26:28.255 --> 26:31.826
I was a superhero on a mission.

26:31.859 --> 26:34.161
And this is the next stop
on my journey,

26:34.195 --> 26:36.063
the City of Angels.

27:30.084 --> 27:31.785
Angie.

27:34.054 --> 27:36.924
It's called Angel.

27:36.957 --> 27:39.994
I wrote it.

27:40.027 --> 27:42.163
You like it?

27:42.196 --> 27:45.299
Wait, how did you get in here?

27:46.967 --> 27:48.769
Through the window.

27:48.802 --> 27:50.371
Like a bird.

27:53.874 --> 27:56.877
You left a spare key
under the doormat.

27:56.911 --> 27:58.979
It's the oldest trick
in the book, you know.

27:59.013 --> 28:01.782
You should be careful.

28:01.815 --> 28:05.853
What, what are you doing here?

28:05.886 --> 28:07.254
You haven't seen me
in five years

28:07.288 --> 28:08.889
and that's the only thing
you can say?

28:08.923 --> 28:11.725
The whole world is going crazy
looking for you.

28:11.759 --> 28:14.895
You're on TV, in the newspaper,
on the radio.

28:14.929 --> 28:17.965
What were you thinking?

28:17.998 --> 28:19.800
I'm like a celebrity.

28:19.833 --> 28:20.734
Would you like an autograph?

28:20.768 --> 28:22.469
No, that's not funny.

28:22.504 --> 28:25.739
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

28:25.773 --> 28:28.042
The police are looking for you.

28:28.075 --> 28:31.745
But you won't tell them.

28:31.779 --> 28:32.780
Right?

28:44.992 --> 28:47.094
Hi.

28:47.127 --> 28:50.297
I tried texting
but you didn't answer.

28:50.331 --> 28:52.366
Are you busy?

28:52.399 --> 28:55.302
I, um, just came in myself.

28:55.336 --> 28:57.738
Yeah, I saw you downstairs.

29:01.909 --> 29:03.811
Any news?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.882
Is it okay if I...

29:08.916 --> 29:11.085
if we talk tomorrow at school?

29:12.953 --> 29:15.055
Yeah, sure.

29:20.394 --> 29:22.296
Renee.

29:24.198 --> 29:26.066
It was good to see you.

29:36.511 --> 29:38.279
She's pretty.

29:40.848 --> 29:44.318
Is that your girlfriend?

29:44.351 --> 29:46.920
Look, um, get your things.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.590
I'm gonna take you
to the airport.

29:48.623 --> 29:50.257
But I just got here.

29:50.291 --> 29:52.459
But you can't stay here.

29:52.493 --> 29:54.261
I'm gonna put you on a plane

29:54.295 --> 29:57.131
and I'll get Sylvia and Grandpa
to pick you up, okay?

29:59.534 --> 30:01.503
You're throwing me out.

30:01.536 --> 30:03.505
No, I'm not throwing you out.

30:13.548 --> 30:15.949
When you walked through
that door,

30:15.983 --> 30:18.118
I thought you were
gonna give me a hug.

30:20.054 --> 30:23.223
Tell me how much you missed me,

30:23.257 --> 30:25.125
and how happy you are to see me.

30:25.159 --> 30:26.994
- I am.
- But you didn't.

30:29.897 --> 30:32.132
You didn't even ask me
if I was okay.

30:34.501 --> 30:38.506
Or if I needed help or...

30:38.540 --> 30:40.441
"Oh, I'm so glad you're alive!"

30:40.474 --> 30:42.276
Don't say that, of course I am.

30:42.309 --> 30:43.911
- I'm just...
- You're what?

30:46.648 --> 30:48.382
You're what?

30:52.353 --> 30:55.590
You know what's sad?

30:55.623 --> 30:57.491
I came here looking
for my father,

30:57.525 --> 31:00.994
but instead I found a stranger
who I don't even know.

31:04.465 --> 31:07.635
I thought you were different.

31:07.669 --> 31:10.270
- I was wrong.
- Angie.

31:12.574 --> 31:14.174
Angie.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.912
Hey.

31:18.946 --> 31:20.214
Angie!

31:25.319 --> 31:26.987
Angie!

31:30.424 --> 31:32.192
Angie!

32:08.362 --> 32:09.697
Angie?

32:36.423 --> 32:38.258
You've grown up.

32:38.292 --> 32:39.527
Thanks.

32:39.561 --> 32:40.961
You haven't.

32:43.565 --> 32:46.266
You gonna run away
if police show up?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.704
No, I'll just pretend
I don't know you.

32:49.737 --> 32:51.739
You're very good at that.

32:59.814 --> 33:02.750
Listen, back there, I,

33:02.784 --> 33:06.286
I shouldn't have reacted
the way I did.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.155
I'm sorry.

33:08.188 --> 33:11.058
You're a coward.

33:11.091 --> 33:12.527
Yes I am.

33:16.764 --> 33:19.366
Any chance that we can start
everything over?

33:23.805 --> 33:27.207
I can fix you.

33:27.241 --> 33:29.577
But you have to listen
and do everything I say.

33:32.747 --> 33:34.348
Are you in?

33:40.354 --> 33:42.690
Just as I thought.

33:42.724 --> 33:45.192
Angie, okay.

33:45.225 --> 33:46.426
I'm in.

33:49.263 --> 33:50.430
Good.

33:50.464 --> 33:53.267
First order of business then
is to fill up your refrigerator

33:53.300 --> 33:55.570
and buy you new clothes.

33:55.603 --> 33:57.237
Wait, what's wrong
with my clothes?

33:57.271 --> 34:01.275
Nothing, if you're going for
a 70 and over look.

34:01.308 --> 34:02.577
Come on, where are you parked?

34:02.610 --> 34:05.747
Uh, it's in the shop.

34:05.780 --> 34:07.782
What's wrong with it?

34:07.815 --> 34:10.117
- I don't know.
- Fine.

34:10.150 --> 34:12.252
Add a new car
to the shopping list too.

34:32.306 --> 34:35.743
You're crazy, you're crazy.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.679
I had to see you.

34:37.712 --> 34:38.980
What are you doing?

34:39.013 --> 34:41.281
You don't answer my phone calls,
you don't respond to my texts.

34:41.315 --> 34:43.885
My mom took it away from me.

34:43.918 --> 34:45.587
I'm sorry.

34:46.921 --> 34:49.456
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.

34:49.489 --> 34:50.792
And you?

34:54.261 --> 34:55.797
What happened?

34:58.398 --> 35:00.267
Where is she?

35:01.936 --> 35:04.271
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

35:04.304 --> 35:05.740
Are you sleeping?

35:05.773 --> 35:08.141
I'm watching TV.

35:08.175 --> 35:11.445
You should try and get
some rest, honey.

35:11.478 --> 35:13.180
Okay.

35:13.213 --> 35:14.649
Goodnight.

35:34.234 --> 35:36.303
I'm glad you're okay.

35:46.346 --> 35:49.751
The fairy tale garden.

35:49.784 --> 35:52.553
You know how obsessed she is
with that place.

36:11.973 --> 36:15.242
Where did you get that?

36:15.275 --> 36:16.276
Mom.

36:16.309 --> 36:18.278
What is he doing here?

36:18.311 --> 36:19.547
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Collins.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.281
I just wanted to make sure
Sarah was okay.

36:21.314 --> 36:23.618
- In the middle of the night?
- Mom, please do not make such...

36:23.651 --> 36:25.653
You get out of my house right
now before I call the police.

36:25.687 --> 36:26.754
- What?
- Get out, I'm not gonna

36:26.788 --> 36:29.289
repeat myself twice, get out!

36:29.322 --> 36:30.591
- Come on.
- You stay right here,

36:30.625 --> 36:33.628
young lady, and you get out
of my house, go.

36:37.431 --> 36:39.701
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Collins.

36:39.734 --> 36:42.737
- I would never...
- Get out of my house!

36:45.707 --> 36:48.609
What's the charge?

36:48.643 --> 36:50.011
I can't.

36:50.044 --> 36:51.879
I have a board meeting
in an hour.

36:54.048 --> 36:55.817
Fine.

36:55.850 --> 36:58.351
You do what you have to do.

37:01.689 --> 37:04.224
- Is everything okay?
- Perfect.

37:05.660 --> 37:07.562
Luis, can you please pull over?

37:07.595 --> 37:09.864
Sure.

37:09.897 --> 37:13.000
I swear, this kid
is not gonna ruin my meeting.

37:19.507 --> 37:21.408
Alice, get me the sheriff.

37:21.441 --> 37:24.411
Tell him it's important.

37:24.444 --> 37:27.048
Call me back.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.994
Yeah?

37:40.027 --> 37:41.929
I thought I was going to do
the hotel pickup

37:41.963 --> 37:44.866
but they sent me to the airport.

37:44.899 --> 37:48.569
I don't know,
someone changed it.

37:48.603 --> 37:49.937
Sure.

37:58.345 --> 37:59.514
I'm dealing with something.

37:59.547 --> 38:01.314
I'll be there as soon as I can.

38:01.348 --> 38:03.350
Bye.

38:03.383 --> 38:05.586
Just got a call from the police.

38:07.588 --> 38:09.857
My son's been arrested.

38:09.891 --> 38:11.659
Again.

38:16.363 --> 38:18.599
You got kids, right?

38:18.633 --> 38:22.369
A girl I think, I remember.

38:22.402 --> 38:25.706
What's your secret?

38:25.740 --> 38:28.441
I tell her my house, my rules.

38:28.475 --> 38:32.513
If she disagrees,
I teach her a lesson.

38:32.547 --> 38:33.981
For example?

38:36.918 --> 38:40.353
For example, the other day, um,

38:40.387 --> 38:43.456
she sent in an application
to this stupid college

38:43.490 --> 38:45.492
I told her not to,

38:45.526 --> 38:48.963
and when the letter
for the interview came,

38:48.996 --> 38:52.533
I took it right in front of her

38:52.567 --> 38:54.569
and I ripped it.

38:56.704 --> 38:58.906
You serious?

38:58.940 --> 39:01.876
That's the only way
she will learn.

39:17.825 --> 39:19.594
Is this funny?

39:27.201 --> 39:29.103
Have you ever gotten a call
in the middle of the night

39:29.136 --> 39:31.839
telling you your kid
has been arrested?

39:34.141 --> 39:37.477
How about juvenile court?

39:37.511 --> 39:39.113
Ever been?

39:41.215 --> 39:45.019
The truth is,

39:45.052 --> 39:47.521
I'd give it all up if I could
trade places with you

39:47.555 --> 39:50.858
and have the same problems
you have with your kid.

40:00.534 --> 40:02.637
Does he know this?

40:12.013 --> 40:14.849
Take me to the police station.

40:14.882 --> 40:16.584
What about your meeting?

40:18.853 --> 40:21.454
What about my son?

40:23.591 --> 40:25.693
Italian.

40:25.726 --> 40:28.629
No brainer.

40:28.663 --> 40:31.799
Hey, you can cook Italian,
right?

40:35.069 --> 40:37.138
Did you fall asleep?

40:37.171 --> 40:39.974
One sec, I'm coming!

40:56.057 --> 40:58.159
Look at you!

40:58.192 --> 41:01.095
Mhm!

41:01.128 --> 41:03.798
I think you're ready.

41:03.831 --> 41:05.498
Ready for what?

41:05.533 --> 41:07.702
Your new chapter.

41:07.735 --> 41:09.770
I don't have to get a new job,
do I?

41:09.804 --> 41:11.572
Not yet, I'll let you know.

41:11.605 --> 41:13.641
Okay, thank you.

41:13.674 --> 41:16.744
So, just out of curiosity,

41:16.777 --> 41:19.914
what exactly are we fixing?

41:25.319 --> 41:26.587
You gonna get that?

41:26.620 --> 41:28.622
You didn't answer my question.

41:31.158 --> 41:33.694
I... I'll just...

41:40.234 --> 41:42.803
Wait, what?

41:42.837 --> 41:44.638
Did you...

41:47.775 --> 41:50.845
Why did you text Renee?

41:50.878 --> 41:54.615
I wanna meet her.

41:54.648 --> 41:56.150
Dinner?

41:56.183 --> 41:58.185
That's not happening,
she's not coming over here.

41:58.219 --> 42:01.889
Okay, chill.

42:01.922 --> 42:03.124
Why not?

42:03.157 --> 42:06.761
Because...

42:06.794 --> 42:08.129
Because...

42:10.364 --> 42:13.134
Because it's just not gonna
happen, okay?

42:13.167 --> 42:16.637
You said "because" three times
and I still don't get it.

42:16.670 --> 42:19.673
Is this what you call
fixing things?

42:19.707 --> 42:21.675
You can't just storm
into people's lives

42:21.709 --> 42:23.811
and start messing things up.

42:28.916 --> 42:31.352
Oh.

42:38.959 --> 42:40.561
Chicken.

42:42.329 --> 42:45.032
Chicken!

42:45.066 --> 42:47.068
Look, you still haven't answered
my question.

42:47.101 --> 42:49.737
- What are we fixing?
- You didn't answer mine.

42:52.106 --> 42:55.276
I think you like her.

42:55.309 --> 42:58.612
I think you like her a lot.

42:58.646 --> 43:02.316
I saw the way you look at her.

43:03.717 --> 43:05.386
She's not coming.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.588
Period.

43:08.956 --> 43:09.924
Where are you going?

43:09.957 --> 43:11.859
To bed.

43:11.892 --> 43:13.194
You're gonna roll up
your sleeves,

43:13.227 --> 43:17.364
start chopping
and stop driving me crazy.

43:17.398 --> 43:19.967
Sh!

43:20.000 --> 43:23.003
We had a deal.

43:26.307 --> 43:27.775
Lasagna.

43:27.808 --> 43:31.312
Youtube's gonna be
your best friend.

43:43.257 --> 43:44.792
Hey.

43:44.825 --> 43:47.895
You're Sarah's father?

43:47.928 --> 43:50.097
Can I help you?

43:50.131 --> 43:51.999
I called in the accident.

43:52.032 --> 43:53.334
I'm not the guy
you want to talk to.

43:53.367 --> 43:55.136
But I got something
I gotta tell you.

43:55.169 --> 43:56.937
Well, if it's about the accident
I don't want to hear it.

43:56.971 --> 44:00.774
Andre saved Sarah.

44:00.808 --> 44:05.079
He dragged her out of the water,
she was unconscious.

44:05.112 --> 44:09.783
All I did was call 9-1-1.

44:09.817 --> 44:11.385
Hey.

44:11.418 --> 44:13.020
Look.

44:13.053 --> 44:16.790
I'm sorry, I should've told you
this before.

44:16.824 --> 44:18.859
Where were you?

44:18.893 --> 44:20.895
Hiding.

44:24.331 --> 44:27.368
I stole this two hours
before the accident.

44:32.072 --> 44:34.341
What about the driver?

44:34.375 --> 44:35.910
Angelina Goodwin.

44:35.943 --> 44:37.111
The girl that
was driving the car,

44:37.144 --> 44:41.015
- what happened to her?
- I don't know, I didn't see her.

44:44.251 --> 44:48.455
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to arrest me?

44:48.489 --> 44:51.258
Pick up the bag.

44:51.292 --> 44:56.363
Pick it up.

44:56.397 --> 44:58.999
You know where
to take that right?

45:01.869 --> 45:03.437
Don't get lost on the way there.

45:03.470 --> 45:05.739
Hey.

45:05.773 --> 45:08.909
Thank you.

45:19.554 --> 45:22.456
Hey.

45:22.489 --> 45:23.857
Can I give you a lift?

45:23.891 --> 45:26.827
I got a ride.

45:26.860 --> 45:28.229
How about taking
the rest of the day off?

45:28.262 --> 45:29.463
I got school.

45:29.496 --> 45:33.100
I've got work.

45:35.202 --> 45:36.370
Maybe we can cruise up
to the lake,

45:36.403 --> 45:37.505
put the boat in the water,

45:37.539 --> 45:41.942
go fishing.

45:41.976 --> 45:44.111
Call it a family emergency.

45:44.144 --> 45:49.350
I, uh, think I have to
return this first.

45:56.123 --> 45:59.326
I think we can arrange that.

46:55.015 --> 46:59.486
So be honest.

46:59.521 --> 47:01.322
I am, it's good.

47:01.355 --> 47:04.325
- Yeah?
- I'm serious.

47:04.358 --> 47:07.961
I am studying YouTube
like the Bible.

47:07.995 --> 47:11.298
It shows.

47:18.339 --> 47:21.609
I'm leaving.

47:21.643 --> 47:25.145
Oh.

47:25.179 --> 47:28.082
Good.

47:28.115 --> 47:33.420
I'm going back to Texas.

47:33.454 --> 47:36.223
When?

47:36.256 --> 47:38.560
August.

47:38.593 --> 47:44.331
Got offered full time.

47:44.365 --> 47:47.067
You want some more wine?

47:47.101 --> 47:49.403
No, I'm fine.

47:49.436 --> 47:53.073
Well, you haven't had any, so.

47:58.445 --> 48:00.214
Where is she?

48:00.247 --> 48:01.415
I'm gonna go get her.

48:01.448 --> 48:02.449
Just let her sleep,
it's fine.

48:02.483 --> 48:05.986
No, it's rude she said
she wanted to meet you.

48:06.019 --> 48:08.455
Dean.

48:08.489 --> 48:12.292
I'm still here.

48:23.437 --> 48:26.273
Angie.

48:28.576 --> 48:31.278
Angie.

48:32.980 --> 48:36.651
Renee is here,
are you going to join us?

48:36.684 --> 48:40.254
Fifteen more minutes.

48:46.393 --> 48:48.596
Should probably give her another
30 minutes.

48:48.630 --> 48:52.634
She's got jet lag so.

48:52.667 --> 48:56.538
Please, sit.

49:04.111 --> 49:07.014
How did she get in anyway?

49:07.047 --> 49:10.451
Through the window
like a little bird.

49:13.655 --> 49:17.559
No, she used the key that
you left under the doormat.

49:17.592 --> 49:20.662
Perfect timing.

49:26.400 --> 49:29.069
Are you okay, Dean?

49:29.102 --> 49:32.239
I'm just happy for you.

49:35.610 --> 49:38.212
Hey look, I...

49:38.245 --> 49:41.448
I should probably go before
I say something I shouldn't.

49:46.754 --> 49:48.623
Renee.

49:50.625 --> 49:52.727
What is it?

49:52.760 --> 49:54.094
Just talk to me.

49:54.127 --> 49:56.698
You don't talk to me.

49:56.731 --> 49:58.766
Every time I try you just...

49:58.800 --> 50:01.068
push me away, even now.

50:04.471 --> 50:07.074
I don't mean to.

50:07.107 --> 50:09.711
I swear, it's just...

50:09.744 --> 50:12.714
I just want you to be happy.

50:12.747 --> 50:15.650
I don't want you
to lose out on life.

50:15.683 --> 50:17.819
Why because you feel like
you missed out on yours?

50:23.858 --> 50:26.326
What if you make me happy?

50:37.872 --> 50:40.107
We don't have to
talk about this now.

50:47.515 --> 50:49.182
Tell me.

50:53.186 --> 50:54.856
Just tell me and I'll...

50:54.889 --> 50:56.758
I'll never bother you again.

51:01.128 --> 51:03.263
Tell you what?

51:03.297 --> 51:05.700
That you don't love me.

51:05.733 --> 51:09.504
That's just the wine talking.

51:09.537 --> 51:11.673
Do you want me to call you
a cab?

51:11.706 --> 51:15.843
You only hear the wine talking.

51:15.877 --> 51:20.582
Okay.

51:20.615 --> 51:23.216
I lied.

51:23.250 --> 51:26.888
There is no job.

51:26.921 --> 51:31.325
I'm leaving because...

51:33.460 --> 51:36.831
I want to help a girl I know.

51:36.864 --> 51:38.900
She fell in love with a man

51:38.933 --> 51:42.402
then made her laugh and cry

51:42.436 --> 51:45.907
and sometimes...

51:45.940 --> 51:51.846
made her angry and sad.

51:51.879 --> 51:53.380
But deep down in her heart

51:53.413 --> 51:54.448
he made her happy.

51:57.284 --> 52:02.356
And she wanted to give this
happiness back to him but...

52:02.389 --> 52:08.395
for some reason
he didn't want to take it.

52:08.428 --> 52:12.499
So when she found out
she was gonna have his child

52:12.533 --> 52:15.469
she didn't say anything to him.

52:15.502 --> 52:19.406
Just quietly flew away
somewhere far.

52:36.323 --> 52:38.258
Did you hear all that?

52:42.897 --> 52:48.468
I should probably run after her,
shouldn't I?

52:49.704 --> 52:51.973
Renee!

52:58.245 --> 53:00.615
Renee.

53:00.648 --> 53:04.217
Call me back please.

53:11.959 --> 53:15.195
I'm sorry.

53:16.798 --> 53:19.767
Let's walk.

53:26.273 --> 53:28.876
Did she remind you of Katie?

53:28.910 --> 53:32.647
Why do you call everyone
by their first name?

53:32.680 --> 53:34.682
Why not?

53:34.716 --> 53:38.786
I call you Dean,
that's your name right.

53:38.820 --> 53:42.523
But you call Martin "Grandpa."

53:42.557 --> 53:45.626
That's true.

53:45.660 --> 53:47.895
That's interesting.

53:47.929 --> 53:52.667
I don't know why that is.

53:52.700 --> 53:55.703
Me and Katie were very young
when we had you,

53:55.737 --> 53:58.438
we hardly even knew each other.

53:58.472 --> 54:01.509
How did it happen?

54:01.542 --> 54:04.579
Sylvia never told you?

54:04.612 --> 54:09.016
No.

54:10.450 --> 54:14.689
When you were six

54:14.722 --> 54:21.562
I just went my way
and she went hers.

54:21.596 --> 54:23.664
One day she took the wrong turn.

54:23.698 --> 54:24.999
Like me.

54:30.337 --> 54:32.439
I've been having these dreams.

54:36.376 --> 54:39.479
I see this white house

54:39.514 --> 54:43.416
somewhere on top of a mountain.

54:43.450 --> 54:46.921
She's standing outside

54:46.954 --> 54:52.927
and when she sees me she smiles.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.063
And she says,

54:56.097 --> 54:59.066
"Come home.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.835
It's time."

55:04.772 --> 55:08.810
That's when I wake up.

55:08.843 --> 55:13.047
And for a moment I feel like...

55:13.080 --> 55:16.083
like it's not a dream.

55:16.117 --> 55:20.588
It's real.

55:20.621 --> 55:25.626
What if...

55:25.660 --> 55:27.662
what if she's alive?

55:37.470 --> 55:41.876
She's your guardian angel.

55:41.909 --> 55:47.114
She's looking after you
every moment of every day.

55:47.148 --> 55:48.783
Come here.

55:56.624 --> 56:01.629
Sylvia was right.

56:01.662 --> 56:06.167
I did run away.

56:06.200 --> 56:14.842
And I blamed the whole world
for my sad little life.

56:14.876 --> 56:18.846
That I didn't become a composer

56:18.880 --> 56:21.883
and that I had a kid too young

56:21.916 --> 56:23.885
and Katie's accident.

56:27.221 --> 56:32.593
And I thought that if I run away
that it would fix things.

56:32.627 --> 56:34.128
It didn't.

56:37.999 --> 56:41.836
And when...

56:45.606 --> 56:50.211
And the thought of losing you,

56:50.244 --> 56:56.684
it opened up my eyes
and made me realize

56:56.717 --> 56:58.019
that the whole time
the only person

56:58.052 --> 57:00.487
that I was running from was me.

57:03.691 --> 57:06.594
I am so sorry.

57:06.627 --> 57:08.095
And I love you so much.

57:17.905 --> 57:22.843
Look at me.

57:22.877 --> 57:25.179
I love you, Dad.

57:26.681 --> 57:28.649
Hey, where are you going?

57:28.683 --> 57:30.885
- I'm gonna talk to her.
- Who?

57:30.918 --> 57:32.253
- Renee.
- This is crazy!

57:32.286 --> 57:33.621
You don't even know
where she lives.

57:33.654 --> 57:35.523
I'm gonna fix everything!

57:58.646 --> 57:59.680
Hello?

57:59.714 --> 58:01.015
Dad?

58:01.048 --> 58:04.552
- Dean.
- Yeah.

58:04.585 --> 58:06.253
Uh, what time is it?

58:06.287 --> 58:07.922
I'm sorry.

58:07.955 --> 58:09.090
No, it's all right.

58:09.123 --> 58:10.291
What's going on?

58:10.324 --> 58:15.096
- Any news?
- No, no.

58:15.129 --> 58:17.064
Okay, please call me
if you hear something.

58:17.098 --> 58:18.933
Yeah.

58:18.966 --> 58:20.301
Everything all right?

58:20.334 --> 58:22.036
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry I woke you up.

58:22.069 --> 58:23.170
I'll talk to you later.

58:23.204 --> 58:24.305
No, that's all right.

58:24.338 --> 58:27.108
W... whoa... De...

58:31.712 --> 58:33.714
She's there, Martin,
I know it.

58:33.748 --> 58:35.783
Well, if she was there
he'd tell us, honey.

58:35.816 --> 58:36.784
No he wouldn't.

58:36.817 --> 58:38.619
Yeah he would.

58:38.652 --> 58:40.855
After all who are we?

58:40.888 --> 58:42.990
We're not his parents,
we're not close friends.

58:43.024 --> 58:46.560
We're nobody.

58:46.594 --> 58:51.165
It's like this huge
dark cloud is above us

58:51.198 --> 58:55.603
without ever letting
the sun inside our home.

58:55.636 --> 58:57.204
And I don't know why,
I don't know

58:57.238 --> 58:59.774
what we've done to deserve this.

58:59.807 --> 59:03.110
Sh, Sylvie.

59:03.144 --> 59:05.913
Don't do that.

59:11.652 --> 59:16.357
Sylvie.

59:16.390 --> 59:18.325
Sylvie, what are you...

59:18.359 --> 59:20.661
Sylvie, what are you doing?

59:20.694 --> 59:21.996
What do you think I'm doing?

59:22.029 --> 59:25.032
Oh, come on.

59:25.066 --> 59:26.901
Look, just don't do this
to yourself.

59:26.934 --> 59:28.769
Just come back to bed.

59:28.803 --> 59:31.372
Don't tell me what to do,
Martin.

59:31.405 --> 59:33.641
When did you
ever listen to anything

59:33.674 --> 59:37.178
I ever told you to do?

59:37.211 --> 59:39.814
You never did.

59:39.847 --> 59:41.782
Certainly not when we...

59:41.816 --> 59:46.353
you shut the door on
our son and I let you do it.

59:46.387 --> 59:48.923
Shouldn't have done that.

59:48.956 --> 59:52.159
We should've done everything
in our power to help him.

59:52.193 --> 59:55.329
To help him achieve
whatever dreams he had

59:55.362 --> 59:57.998
but we didn't do that, did we?

59:58.032 --> 1:00:00.234
No.

1:00:00.267 --> 1:00:03.804
Maybe that's why he doesn't
consider us his friends

1:00:03.838 --> 1:00:06.874
or his family.

1:00:10.044 --> 1:00:13.948
We're what's dark around here.

1:00:13.981 --> 1:00:17.017
We're the cloud.

1:00:25.159 --> 1:00:26.393
- So much better.
- Gotta eat more than me,

1:00:26.427 --> 1:00:28.963
I'm getting a belly.

1:00:28.996 --> 1:00:33.767
Morning.

1:00:33.801 --> 1:00:36.036
Mark made waffles.

1:00:36.070 --> 1:00:38.239
Do you want some?

1:00:38.272 --> 1:00:40.107
I'm not hungry.

1:00:40.141 --> 1:00:42.810
Do you want some eggs?

1:00:42.843 --> 1:00:44.979
Where are you going?

1:00:45.012 --> 1:00:46.947
- My room.
- Can you please come

1:00:46.981 --> 1:00:48.415
sit here with us?

1:00:48.449 --> 1:00:51.218
So I can listen to you
whining at me, no thanks.

1:00:51.252 --> 1:00:54.188
- Sarah, don't go there.
- Where?

1:00:54.221 --> 1:00:56.757
I can't use my phone,
I can't go to my room.

1:00:56.790 --> 1:00:58.292
I can't talk to my boyfriend,
now I can't even talk.

1:00:58.325 --> 1:01:00.194
Ladies, please
let's just take it easy.

1:01:00.227 --> 1:01:01.929
RJ's nice, Mommy.

1:01:01.962 --> 1:01:03.197
Why don't you like him?

1:01:03.230 --> 1:01:06.800
Is it because he's black.

1:01:06.834 --> 1:01:11.739
Eat your waffles, Bobby.

1:01:11.772 --> 1:01:13.207
Sarah!

1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:16.110
Where'd she go?

1:01:19.213 --> 1:01:22.283
Sarah!

1:01:22.316 --> 1:01:26.854
Oh my god,
you gotta be kidding me!

1:01:26.887 --> 1:01:28.889
- What happened?
- Terry, Sarah's gone.

1:01:28.923 --> 1:01:31.458
She took my car and she left.

1:01:31.492 --> 1:01:35.362
I don't know,
probably to see her boyfriend.

1:01:35.396 --> 1:01:38.032
I want you to be her father.

1:01:38.065 --> 1:01:39.366
That boy is bad news.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:42.836
No he's... Okay, call me back.

1:01:42.870 --> 1:01:45.472
I just... I don't know.

1:01:49.877 --> 1:01:52.913
So this social work thing,

1:01:52.947 --> 1:01:55.983
what is it?

1:01:56.016 --> 1:01:58.819
It's a good thing, Dad.

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:01.021
It's a way to help make
people's lives better.

1:02:01.055 --> 1:02:03.490
God makes people's lives better.

1:02:03.525 --> 1:02:08.429
Well, maybe sometimes
he sends someone to help them.

1:02:08.462 --> 1:02:12.466
So this Jane Addams University,
is it any good?

1:02:12.499 --> 1:02:15.102
Best in the country.

1:02:15.135 --> 1:02:18.205
And they really pay
for your full tuition?

1:02:18.239 --> 1:02:24.912
If I get the
Presidential Scholarship, yes.

1:02:24.945 --> 1:02:27.848
Sounds too good to be true.

1:02:40.894 --> 1:02:43.864
Hey.

1:02:46.233 --> 1:02:47.468
I have a late pickup tonight

1:02:47.501 --> 1:02:50.371
so I'll probably see you
tomorrow.

1:02:50.404 --> 1:02:52.806
Okay.

1:03:01.215 --> 1:03:04.385
Selena.

1:03:04.418 --> 1:03:10.257
Your father wanted me
to give you this.

1:03:52.199 --> 1:03:55.369
Your mom told me
you might be here.

1:03:55.402 --> 1:03:58.272
Great.

1:03:58.305 --> 1:04:02.409
Now she knows too.

1:04:02.443 --> 1:04:06.380
Knows what?

1:04:06.413 --> 1:04:09.416
I know how it looks.

1:04:09.450 --> 1:04:12.186
I come in the middle of the
night after all this happened,

1:04:12.219 --> 1:04:17.424
but her mom wasn't going to
let me in the front door.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:20.160
What are you talking about?

1:04:20.194 --> 1:04:25.533
What are you talking about?

1:04:25.567 --> 1:04:28.035
Where is she?

1:04:28.068 --> 1:04:30.471
Sarah?

1:04:30.505 --> 1:04:32.272
She's not at home?

1:04:32.306 --> 1:04:37.177
No, she took her mom's car,
drove off.

1:04:37.211 --> 1:04:39.179
What?

1:04:39.213 --> 1:04:41.181
Where?

1:04:41.215 --> 1:04:44.418
I was hoping you could tell me.

1:04:48.288 --> 1:04:50.257
Well.

1:04:50.290 --> 1:04:56.330
Great.

1:04:56.363 --> 1:04:58.265
I guess she didn't tell you
either.

1:04:58.298 --> 1:05:01.235
No.

1:05:01.268 --> 1:05:04.371
What happened, like where
would she go with her car?

1:05:04.405 --> 1:05:08.610
If anybody would have a clue,
that'd be you.

1:05:12.547 --> 1:05:15.517
All right, look.

1:05:15.550 --> 1:05:21.488
Just call me on my cellphone

1:05:21.523 --> 1:05:24.057
if you hear from her, okay.

1:05:24.091 --> 1:05:27.394
Not at the station, my cell.

1:05:31.566 --> 1:05:35.570
Follow the butterfly.

1:05:35.603 --> 1:05:38.038
Fairytale Garden!

1:05:38.071 --> 1:05:40.374
She's at the Fairytale Garden,
I know it!

1:05:40.407 --> 1:05:41.975
Where is it?

1:05:42.009 --> 1:05:44.646
I know exactly where it is.

1:05:44.679 --> 1:05:49.584
Renee?

1:05:49.617 --> 1:05:53.454
Hey.

1:05:53.487 --> 1:05:57.458
Glad I found you.

1:05:57.491 --> 1:06:00.060
What do you want, Dean?

1:06:00.093 --> 1:06:03.230
I just built up this wall
of excuses of why

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:07.735
it wouldn't work
between us and...

1:06:07.769 --> 1:06:17.645
I don't want to do that anymore.

1:06:17.679 --> 1:06:21.683
Do you remember
when we first met?

1:06:21.716 --> 1:06:25.319
We were sitting next
to each other at school.

1:06:25.352 --> 1:06:29.557
We had that um...

1:06:29.591 --> 1:06:33.360
long, silly conversation

1:06:33.393 --> 1:06:38.265
just pretending to be teenagers

1:06:38.298 --> 1:06:40.100
drinking milk and cookies.

1:06:44.204 --> 1:06:45.573
I...

1:06:49.811 --> 1:06:52.814
I love you.

1:06:52.847 --> 1:06:55.249
I love you so much.

1:07:06.728 --> 1:07:08.462
Dean.

1:07:14.401 --> 1:07:16.704
You're a horrible salesman.

1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:37.257
Hey, did she ever
come to see you?

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:39.827
Have you been out
all this time looking for her?

1:07:39.861 --> 1:07:42.296
And you.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:49.403
Yeah?

1:07:49.436 --> 1:07:53.808
Yeah, she's right here
in front of me eating.

1:07:53.841 --> 1:07:55.743
Fine.

1:07:55.777 --> 1:07:57.411
Okay, we will be there,

1:07:57.444 --> 1:08:00.548
uh, I don't know,
give me 30 minutes

1:08:00.582 --> 1:08:03.585
and I'll bring her by.

1:08:03.618 --> 1:08:07.154
Okay.

1:08:07.187 --> 1:08:09.857
Jeez.

1:08:09.891 --> 1:08:14.829
Uh, Angie's grandmother
would like to talk to you.

1:08:14.862 --> 1:08:15.897
About?

1:08:15.930 --> 1:08:18.465
I don't know, she didn't say.

1:08:18.498 --> 1:08:20.735
I'm not going to go over
to that house.

1:08:20.768 --> 1:08:23.303
That woman, she's wretched.

1:08:23.337 --> 1:08:25.472
Well, that woman is your mother.

1:08:25.506 --> 1:08:26.808
Well, it's easy for you to say.

1:08:26.841 --> 1:08:30.645
You don't have
to live with her anymore.

1:08:30.678 --> 1:08:36.851
Sure, but I accept her
for who she is.

1:08:36.884 --> 1:08:40.253
You're going to have to do
that too.

1:08:40.287 --> 1:08:41.889
No, I don't.

1:08:41.923 --> 1:08:44.859
She doesn't accept me.

1:08:44.892 --> 1:08:46.928
If it was me,
I would go over there anyway

1:08:46.961 --> 1:08:49.797
just to prove a point,

1:08:49.831 --> 1:08:51.398
take a stand,

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:54.301
make her accept me for who I am,

1:08:54.334 --> 1:08:56.571
respect me.

1:08:56.604 --> 1:09:00.407
But that's just me.

1:09:02.610 --> 1:09:06.213
And how would I do that?

1:09:09.984 --> 1:09:12.386
Take Andre with you.

1:09:32.874 --> 1:09:38.913
Well will you
stop looking for her?

1:09:38.946 --> 1:09:43.316
When we find her.

1:09:43.350 --> 1:09:45.787
What if you never find her?

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:48.723
Then we never stop looking.

1:09:51.693 --> 1:09:53.326
He's coming.

1:09:56.564 --> 1:09:58.398
Good.

1:10:04.772 --> 1:10:06.007
Angie?

1:10:09.677 --> 1:10:11.244
Angie?

1:10:11.278 --> 1:10:12.980
Are you there?

1:11:06.466 --> 1:11:08.703
You know, Bobby's a good looking
kid, where is he?

1:11:08.736 --> 1:11:13.440
He's with Mark at his mothers.

1:11:13.473 --> 1:11:15.408
You have some nerve.

1:11:15.442 --> 1:11:17.812
Showing up here with him.

1:11:17.845 --> 1:11:19.781
Best buds, I bet.

1:11:19.814 --> 1:11:22.650
Yeah, as a matter a fact we are.

1:11:22.683 --> 1:11:25.553
And you probably should too.

1:11:25.586 --> 1:11:27.387
Especially when you find out
that he is the one

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:29.557
who saved our daughter's life.

1:11:29.590 --> 1:11:32.593
- What?
- Yeah.

1:11:32.627 --> 1:11:34.729
The bruises that he has,
they're not from the accident.

1:11:34.762 --> 1:11:36.597
They're from his busting out
the window

1:11:36.631 --> 1:11:39.801
so that he could pull Sarah
out of the water to safety.

1:11:39.834 --> 1:11:43.370
That's what happened.

1:11:46.507 --> 1:11:48.042
Terry don't, just...

1:11:48.075 --> 1:11:50.912
Go for Detective Knight.

1:12:33.921 --> 1:12:38.826
I love you so much.

1:12:56.143 --> 1:12:58.411
She wrote this.

1:12:58.445 --> 1:13:02.884
Angie, wrote this.

1:13:02.917 --> 1:13:06.053
It's called Angel.

1:13:10.925 --> 1:13:14.128
I have something for you.

1:13:32.613 --> 1:13:36.449
Sarah.

1:13:36.483 --> 1:13:37.852
You don't have to tell me
where she is

1:13:37.885 --> 1:13:41.989
just tell me she's okay.

1:13:43.724 --> 1:13:45.526
Does she need money?

1:13:45.559 --> 1:13:47.728
Nobody has to know.

1:13:47.762 --> 1:13:50.898
What?

1:13:50.932 --> 1:13:53.100
Ugh.

1:13:56.704 --> 1:13:58.005
Really?

1:14:18.159 --> 1:14:22.563
Honey, is she okay?

1:14:22.596 --> 1:14:24.065
Okay.

1:14:24.098 --> 1:14:27.702
Ah.

1:14:27.735 --> 1:14:30.204
Thanks for the update.

1:14:46.287 --> 1:14:48.956
She came to see you.

1:14:52.827 --> 1:14:54.095
Hello?

1:14:54.128 --> 1:14:56.664
Sylvie, I found her passport.

1:14:56.697 --> 1:14:58.766
I'm holding it in my hands.

1:14:58.799 --> 1:15:03.671
It was underneath her bed.

1:15:03.704 --> 1:15:07.308
Oh, Martin.

1:15:07.341 --> 1:15:11.145
I never left the key
under your doormat, Dean.

1:15:11.178 --> 1:15:13.014
I had it the entire time.

1:15:18.652 --> 1:15:19.820
What are you saying?

1:15:32.133 --> 1:15:36.604
They found Angie's body.

1:15:36.637 --> 1:15:40.775
What?

1:15:40.808 --> 1:15:44.211
The current had dragged it

1:15:44.245 --> 1:15:48.849
13 miles from the crash site.

1:15:48.883 --> 1:15:50.618
No.

1:15:50.651 --> 1:15:53.154
Oh my god, no.

1:16:27.221 --> 1:16:32.159
I guess it's pretty sad to think
that my story ends here.

1:16:32.193 --> 1:16:33.861
It doesn't.

1:16:39.366 --> 1:16:41.402
No one remembers
the last time it snowed

1:16:41.435 --> 1:16:46.173
in Garden Land, Florida.

1:16:46.207 --> 1:16:49.310
I guess I'm a little
overwhelmed too

1:16:49.343 --> 1:16:51.378
and at the same time,
very excited.

1:16:55.449 --> 1:16:58.285
Today, I am turning 18.

1:16:58.319 --> 1:17:00.321
I waited for this moment
all my life.

1:17:07.161 --> 1:17:08.429
I can finally do
all those things

1:17:08.462 --> 1:17:12.233
I always dreamed about.

1:17:12.266 --> 1:17:15.936
I can take a vacation
anywhere in the world.

1:17:15.970 --> 1:17:19.173
I can buy fireworks.

1:17:19.206 --> 1:17:21.442
Go skydiving.

1:17:21.475 --> 1:17:25.980
I can even buy
my own lottery ticket.

1:17:35.823 --> 1:17:38.058
But when you're a superhero

1:17:38.092 --> 1:17:41.395
you don't need
any of those things.

1:17:41.428 --> 1:17:43.197
Believe me.

1:17:43.230 --> 1:17:46.300
When you can fly
and be invisible,

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:49.870
all your human wishes
become boring.

1:17:49.904 --> 1:17:54.175
I guess you want to know
if I saved the world.

1:18:56.837 --> 1:19:00.975
Angie Goodwin.

1:19:01.008 --> 1:19:03.244
I knew it was you.

1:19:06.247 --> 1:19:08.916
What?

1:19:08.949 --> 1:19:10.484
What's in the chart?

1:19:10.518 --> 1:19:12.453
How clever.

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:14.955
Don't worry.

1:19:14.989 --> 1:19:18.025
My lips are sealed.

1:19:33.941 --> 1:19:38.112
Of course it was you.

1:19:38.145 --> 1:19:40.014
We do not slam doors
in this house.

1:19:40.047 --> 1:19:42.349
- The door's wide open.
- Then who did it?

1:19:42.383 --> 1:19:44.818
I don't know who did it, okay.

1:19:44.852 --> 1:19:47.254
A ghost did it.

1:19:47.288 --> 1:19:49.890
And then you appeared out
of nowhere.

1:19:49.923 --> 1:19:52.359
Told me you were going to
teach my dad a lesson.

1:20:01.536 --> 1:20:03.470
I thought I was going to do
the hotel to pick up

1:20:03.504 --> 1:20:05.839
but they sent me to the airport.

1:20:05.873 --> 1:20:07.875
I don't know,
someone changed it.

1:20:17.652 --> 1:20:20.622
I knew you were behind it.

1:20:29.296 --> 1:20:31.432
I followed the butterflies

1:20:31.465 --> 1:20:34.902
because I knew
that I'd find you here.

1:20:34.935 --> 1:20:38.872
This will always be
our Fairytale Garden.

1:21:06.266 --> 1:21:08.402
I kept my promise.

1:21:08.435 --> 1:21:10.471
What about you?

1:21:10.504 --> 1:21:13.641
When are you coming home?

1:21:26.654 --> 1:21:28.556
Ever since I was a little girl

1:21:28.590 --> 1:21:32.126
I had this dream.

1:21:32.159 --> 1:21:37.699
One day, I become a superhero
in my very own fairytale.

1:21:37.732 --> 1:21:41.368
I can fly, be invisible

1:21:41.402 --> 1:21:43.437
and at the end,

1:21:43.470 --> 1:21:46.407
save the world.

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:49.076
My world.

1:21:49.109 --> 1:21:53.080
People that are closest
and dearest to my heart.

1:21:56.183 --> 1:21:57.317
You know what?

1:21:58.485 --> 1:22:02.222
I got away with it.

1:22:02.256 --> 1:22:04.391
I hope one day you will too.

1:22:08.530 --> 1:22:10.532
And to answer Sylvia's question.

1:22:16.136 --> 1:22:17.605
Ask Renee.
