WEBVTT

01:22.582 --> 01:24.000
- Hey, it's me.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.835
Why were you not
at work last night?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.170
Why are you not
calling me back?

01:27.253 --> 01:32.008
I'm starting to freak, okay?
So call me, now.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.219
- No.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.389
What are you doing here?
- Hey, hey, uh, sorry.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.101
I dropped by the club last
night, but you weren't there.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.060
- Who told you where I live?

02:24.143 --> 02:27.063
- You told me
at dinner the other night.

02:27.146 --> 02:29.732
- Okay, well,
it's not a great time.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.735
- Okay, I just wanted to...

02:36.281 --> 02:36.906
They're apology sweets.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.576
- I know what kashiori are for.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.744
- The other night at the club,
I, um, had a really shit day,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.831
but that's not an excuse for me

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
to be an asshole to you,
so I'm sorry.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.169
- Yeah, you were,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.255
but you brought me
"I'm an asshole" sweets,

02:52.338 --> 02:53.173
so thank you.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.052
- Thanks for taking them.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.679
It's good to see you.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.931
- You too.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.980
Can I say one thing?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.940
- Sure.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.233
- You and Sato.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.443
- Yeah?
- Be careful.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.944
- Excuse me?

03:15.028 --> 03:18.489
- I know a lot
about those people

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
and how they
live their lives...

03:19.991 --> 03:21.868
- Don't talk to me about this.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.037
- And I don't want you to get
in too deep and to get hurt.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.955
- Go home
and fuck yourself, Jake.

03:26.039 --> 03:26.789
Take 'em.
- Please listen to me.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.500
- Take 'em.
- I'm just...

03:31.044 --> 03:32.211
- Fuck.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.978
- Fucking bullshit
is what it is.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.201
- Hey, handsome.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.998
- What?

07:37.081 --> 07:39.333
- Three different
Tozawa profiles,

07:39.417 --> 07:41.377
three different
Yakuza fan magazines--

07:41.460 --> 07:44.213
it's all written
by the same guy, Ukai Haruki.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.593
So this guy is, like,

07:48.676 --> 07:51.053
Tozawa's publicist.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.638
- So?

07:52.722 --> 07:53.723
- Can you help me
find the listing?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.895
- Okay.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.419
- Holy shit, Ukai Haruki.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.588
I mean,
you're Ukai Haruki, right?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.466
- I'm sorry.

08:28.549 --> 08:28.925
Do you speak English?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.510
- How you find me?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.304
H-how you get this address?

08:33.387 --> 08:35.431
- I got it
from, uh, Tejima-san,

08:35.514 --> 08:38.309
the writer of
the Crazy Boys fanzine.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.270
- I don't know Crazy Boys
or Tejima-san.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.689
- Yeah, well, he knows you.
We all know you.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.441
You're a rock star, dude,

08:45.524 --> 08:48.402
you know, especially
with Tozawa on the rise.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.987
This is the first thing
that I ever bought

08:50.071 --> 08:51.656
when I came to Japan,

08:51.739 --> 08:55.159
and I'm obsessed
with what you do, and--

08:55.243 --> 08:58.829
- Good profile.
- Yeah.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.581
- Tozawa-san was pleased.
- Really?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.794
Would you mind?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.088
Could you?

09:07.171 --> 09:10.258
- You want sign?
- Please.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.097
Look, I-I-I brought this
for you, too.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.891
- What's this?
- Uh, sweets.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.851
- You bring for me?
- Yes.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.108
Um, but if you...

09:27.191 --> 09:30.152
I have these, too,
if you please would sign.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.071
- Yeah, yeah, you--you come.

09:32.154 --> 09:32.989
- I come in?
- Yeah, you come.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.533
- Oh, thank you.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.826
- Close the door.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.369
- Okay.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.372
- Come.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.376
- Wow.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.672
This is incredible.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.966
You probably know things
about the big man

09:52.049 --> 09:53.342
that nobody does, huh?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.762
I mean, you know,
I hear stories,

09:56.846 --> 10:00.016
but probably nothing
that you don't already know.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.394
- You hear?
What you hear?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.439
- That suicide
that was written up

10:06.522 --> 10:08.941
in the paper the other day,
the banker?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.860
The word is, is that Tozawa

10:10.943 --> 10:13.696
is controlling
that insurance scam.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.365
- I know nothing.
- Come on, you can tell me.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.575
You know, as a fan.
Just a little tidbit.

10:17.658 --> 10:21.579
- Anything not in magazine,
I write in my book.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.873
- A book, really?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.879
- I go piss now.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.243
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

11:02.453 --> 11:04.038
- You smoke shabu?

11:04.121 --> 11:07.458
- No.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.752
But I'm cool with it.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.509
- You know, most people
in Japan, they ps-ps-ps.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.761
So stupid.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.264
Smoke is better, clean.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.642
Good to know.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.732
- Ah, yeah, his girlfriends.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.526
Many, many girlfriends.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.486
- You took these photos?

11:35.569 --> 11:38.072
- Mistresses--no, no, taboo.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.532
Yeah?

11:39.615 --> 11:43.994
This one,
she talk to reporter once.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.923
- And how about her?

11:56.006 --> 11:57.967
- Oh, you like her?

11:58.050 --> 12:00.719
- She's pretty, right?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.013
- Don't touch her, okay?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.249
- Nice watch.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.961
Are you following me?

16:03.045 --> 16:07.383
Or perhaps you like
to watch women put on makeup.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.431
- I'm a reporter
for the "Meicho."

16:14.515 --> 16:16.141
- I remember.

16:20.521 --> 16:25.067
- My paper has a few questions
they'd like to ask you.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.904
- And what would those
be about?

16:28.987 --> 16:33.075
- Well, one of...

16:33.158 --> 16:36.495
Tozawa's mistresses
went missing

16:36.578 --> 16:37.579
because she spoke to the press.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.541
Would you care to comment?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.751
- If I did have something
to say,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.754
do you think I'd be foolish
enough to say it to you?

16:45.838 --> 16:49.174
- We could get lunch
or a drink.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.926
I'm a very good listener.

16:51.009 --> 16:54.263
- Hmm, that may be true,
but you're also clearly insane.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.934
- I get that
you're afraid of him.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.561
- No.

17:00.644 --> 17:04.273
It is you who should be afraid,
"Meicho"-san.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.496
- You know how many messages

21:29.579 --> 21:32.416
I left for you?
- Okay, I got it. I'm sorry.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.212
- Matsuo came in last night
looking for you.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.423
Did your money offer not work?

21:41.466 --> 21:45.387
When you did not show,
I thought for a second

21:45.470 --> 21:47.139
maybe you decide
it's better to run.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.391
- Then I think, no,

21:49.474 --> 21:53.395
'cause Samantha would call her
best friend first, right?

21:53.478 --> 21:54.813
- Pol, I would
never disappear on you.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.273
- Okay.
- I promise.

21:56.356 --> 21:57.733
- I almost confront him.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.152
Then I think maybe
I make it worse for you.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.903
I've done that before.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.739
- I know, listen,
we'll talk about this later.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.407
Right now we have clients.

22:20.047 --> 22:23.133
- Table five.
He's been asking for you.

22:23.216 --> 22:26.136
- Wakatta.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.132
I'm gonna ask you
some things.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.176
- Be my guest.
- Why?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.639
- Your charms are to my liking.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.642
- How many sessions
will it take?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.811
- 12 is my lucky number.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.314
- Seven's mine.
- Then ten it is.

23:23.068 --> 23:27.072
- Are you a Mormon?
- No.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.825
- No, the church wouldn't work
with a man like you.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.494
Who hired you?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.457
- Your father.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.919
He made it clear
how much it wounded him

23:41.002 --> 23:42.921
that you abandoned the family

23:43.004 --> 23:46.216
and what he was willing to do
to get you back.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.552
It's very simple, Samantha.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.178
You can take my offer,

23:50.262 --> 23:53.223
or you can go home
and face him.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.641
- See you tomorrow at00.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.072
- Hai.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.602
- Hai.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.850
- Mm.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.508
- Who gave you this information?

33:33.344 --> 33:35.596
- Yes.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.306
And I know
what you're gonna say.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.642
He's clearly using me to hit
back at Tozawa, but who cares?

33:39.726 --> 33:42.562
Because we're talking about
stopping a plane full of meth

33:42.645 --> 33:44.105
from entering Tokyo.

33:44.188 --> 33:48.109
- How do you know Ishida
is telling you the truth?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.111
- He has no reason to lie.

33:56.033 --> 33:58.870
So the plane's
getting in tomorrow morning.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.121
We're gonna have to move fast.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.086
- We do not have to move.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.590
I will investigate
when the time is right.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.551
- The time...

34:15.052 --> 34:17.680
I don't understand.
I bring you this information.

34:17.764 --> 34:21.100
I-it's tomorrow morning.
We have to move on it.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.185
You just want to wait?

34:24.562 --> 34:27.315
- A man was just killed
when he fell from the roof

34:27.398 --> 34:29.859
of the headquarters
of Chihara-Kai.

34:29.942 --> 34:30.818
- When?
- Two days ago.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.487
It was kept quiet
to keep the peace.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.988
- Who was it?

34:34.071 --> 34:37.700
- The traitor whose name
you gave to Ishida.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.499
Everything you do
has consequences.

34:44.582 --> 34:49.003
With information,
there is always a cost.

34:49.086 --> 34:53.341
If there is a story here,
it will be yours to write.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.509
But you must have patience.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.219
Trust me when I say

34:56.302 --> 35:00.014
that acting rashly
could jeopardize many things.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.566
Do you trust me?

36:01.075 --> 36:03.870
No way, baby.

36:03.953 --> 36:04.912
Hi.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.123
- Happy anniversary, baby!

36:08.833 --> 36:11.711
Three months.
- No way.

36:11.794 --> 36:14.005
- Party time.
- Okay.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.924
I thought maybe we could do
something different tonight,

36:17.008 --> 36:18.259
the two of us.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.386
- No, baby, tonight's a party.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.388
Everyone wants
to celebrate you.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.557
Let's go.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.934
Get in.
- All right.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.603
- It's gonna be fun.
- You always get me.

36:53.586 --> 36:57.131
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.360
- These are new.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.787
What happened?

37:28.746 --> 37:31.540
Did they hurt you?

37:33.584 --> 37:35.252
- No.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.301
- It's okay.
You don't have to explain.

37:58.985 --> 38:02.655
- There is my work...

38:02.738 --> 38:05.366
and there is you.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.284
I will keep them separate.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.539
- Me too.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.722
- Are you hungry?

38:27.805 --> 38:29.265
- Yeah.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.435
Ten minutes.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.330
- Polina, don't worry about him.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.458
He'll be here soon
and then with you

38:55.541 --> 38:56.917
for the rest of the night.

39:01.005 --> 39:01.797
- Come on.

39:01.881 --> 39:06.594
You know you're
Akira's favorite, right?

39:06.677 --> 39:09.346
- Yeah, I can see that.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.449
- You do not have much
to cook with.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.535
- I know.
I'd make a terrible housewife.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.418
Who taught you to cook?

39:40.711 --> 39:42.379
- My father.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.724
He wanted to be a chef...

39:53.808 --> 39:56.811
but needed money
to support new family.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.064
Life got in the way.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.025
- Yeah, it does that.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.820
- When I was a boy...

40:05.903 --> 40:07.321
he showed me
everything he knows.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.159
He was very hard on me.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.912
It was too much, the pressure.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.753
But I can still do this.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.692
Itadakimasu.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.318
- Itadakimasu.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.571
Thank you.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.792
- Mmm.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.590
Good?
- Yeah, really good.

41:19.226 --> 41:20.811
- What?

41:29.111 --> 41:30.821
"Choose the right."

41:34.909 --> 41:36.577
The right what?
- Path.

41:40.039 --> 41:43.500
- And your father,
he gave you this?

41:43.584 --> 41:47.463
- Right before I left,
to remind me of my duty.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.049
- To God?
- To him.

41:54.428 --> 41:57.223
- And your father sent the man
who found you?

41:59.516 --> 42:01.769
Who is this man?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.604
- I don't know.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.106
Baby, I really don't know.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.442
- What does he want from you?

42:19.119 --> 42:21.622
Who have you told about this?

42:21.705 --> 42:23.624
- No one.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.004
No one--you.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.467
I told you.
I trust you.

42:34.927 --> 42:38.514
Baby...

42:38.597 --> 42:41.058
I'm scared.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.050
- Kei, Kei, Kei, Kei!

43:18.429 --> 43:20.014
What are you doing here?

43:20.097 --> 43:21.056
- I'm sorry.
I have a tip.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.058
It could be a massive scoop.
And it's time-sensitive.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.024
- Kei!

43:36.071 --> 43:38.782
- Fuck you!

43:44.621 --> 43:46.498
- Sorry.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.305
- My brother.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.931
- Lot of spirit.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.767
- He--he's not well.

44:04.850 --> 44:09.021
He has--he sees conspiracies.

44:09.104 --> 44:12.483
- Oh.
- He doesn't go outside.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.695
- Listen, uh, I have
a reliable source

44:16.779 --> 44:19.239
that says
a large shipment of meth

44:19.323 --> 44:20.157
is being smuggled
into the country tomorrow.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.575
- Whose is it?

44:21.658 --> 44:25.537
- Tozawa's,
and I know the airport.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.414
I know the plane
it's coming in on.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.708
All I need is a cop
to authorize the search.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.335
I went to Katagiri,

44:31.418 --> 44:33.545
and he told me
that I couldn't pursue it.

44:33.629 --> 44:37.508
- You don't work for Katagiri.
He can't tell you what to do.

44:37.591 --> 44:39.259
Find someone else.

44:40.969 --> 44:43.013
Go.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.139
- Okay.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.935
- Jake, Jake.

44:48.018 --> 44:51.688
No one at the office knows
about my brother.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.107
Please don't mention him.

44:53.190 --> 44:53.982
- Mention who?

45:10.040 --> 45:12.793
- Ah.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.294
My one true love.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.755
- Don't blow smoke up my ass.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.507
- I would do it.

45:18.590 --> 45:20.759
- Aw.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.303
- Hey.
- Come here.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.848
Baby.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.850
Guys, uh, three months, right?

45:27.933 --> 45:29.435
- You're right.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

45:29.518 --> 45:32.187
I just told her that you should
get some of the good stuff.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.523
- A magnum would be super nice,
but, no, no, no, no.

45:34.606 --> 45:37.151
You shouldn't waste
any more money on me.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.736
- I don't know.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.781
Maybe I get you drunk enough,
you behave yourself.

45:42.865 --> 45:47.703
- Anything you want, baby.
It's your night.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.331
- Ray-chan!

45:51.415 --> 45:53.417
- Hai, Polina.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.002
Would you
like something to drink?

46:02.134 --> 46:04.553
- Yeah!

46:10.392 --> 46:13.020
- Polina-san, Polina!

46:34.625 --> 46:37.085
- Whoo!

48:13.724 --> 48:15.475
- There's a drug shipment

48:15.559 --> 48:18.478
coming into Tokyo
in a few hours by plane.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.063
- Yes.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.942
You promise me the exclusive,
I'll give you the details.

48:25.902 --> 48:29.489
- Where did this information
come from?

48:29.573 --> 48:31.867
- A very good source
that I cannot reveal.

48:31.950 --> 48:34.953
- You tell Katagiri about this?

48:35.037 --> 48:35.871
- Why would I tell Katagiri
about it?

48:35.954 --> 48:38.457
Everyone knows
you're the better detective.

48:38.540 --> 48:39.791
- Don't bullshit.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.376
I know you guys have a thing.

48:41.460 --> 48:42.836
- We have a thing, too.
- What did he say?

48:42.919 --> 48:45.047
- He said he wanted to look
into it more,

48:45.130 --> 48:46.214
but we don't have time.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.091
It's coming in a few hours.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.844
Listen, this source...

48:50.927 --> 48:52.721
they're in the world.

48:52.804 --> 48:54.222
You know what I mean?
- Got it.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.766
- They've been right about
this kind of thing before.

48:55.849 --> 48:57.059
If they say this is happening,
it's a good bet.

48:59.561 --> 49:02.606
- Tell me more on the way.

49:02.689 --> 49:04.358
So let's go.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.686
- Yosh.

50:12.300 --> 50:14.094
- Hai!
- Hai.

50:47.085 --> 50:47.127
- Hai.

51:01.767 --> 51:04.394
- There are no fucking drugs

51:04.478 --> 51:05.937
on the plane.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.607
Who gave you this tip?
- I can't tell you.

51:08.690 --> 51:11.985
- You realize
they fucked both of us?

51:12.068 --> 51:15.989
I will make it so no cop
will talk to you ever again.

51:16.072 --> 51:17.449
- No, no, don't do that.
- Ever.

51:17.532 --> 51:18.825
- It's not my fault.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.036
- Fuck you,
and fuck your paper.

52:00.700 --> 52:03.286
- We could have interviewed

52:03.370 --> 52:05.664
every employee quietly,

52:05.747 --> 52:08.375
built our case strong enough
to prevent any way

52:08.458 --> 52:09.751
for Tozawa to escape.

52:09.835 --> 52:13.630
Now he'll change everything--

52:13.713 --> 52:17.759
his location, his method,
double his protection.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.054
Because of you,
we start from nothing.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.560
- I'm sorry. I...

52:26.643 --> 52:28.728
I-I needed a story.

52:28.812 --> 52:30.897
I don't know what happened.
My source has been good--

52:30.981 --> 52:32.649
- Such entitlement.

52:32.732 --> 52:35.193
Such a disappointment.

55:42.505 --> 55:44.049
- Aah!

56:53.409 --> 56:54.828
- Why would your source

56:54.911 --> 56:56.079
give you bad information?

56:56.162 --> 56:58.581
- I don't know.
They wouldn't.

56:58.665 --> 56:59.999
It must have been...

57:00.083 --> 57:03.128
uh, just a mistake.

57:47.088 --> 57:48.548
- It's not that great

57:48.631 --> 57:50.216
of a story anyway,
and if we publish it,

57:50.300 --> 57:52.468
I burn two different sources

57:52.552 --> 57:54.596
for this one average-ass story.

58:50.860 --> 58:53.613
- Hey.

58:56.991 --> 58:58.785
- You don't need
to worry anymore.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.331
- Are you sure?

59:06.042 --> 59:08.127
Did you talk to him?

59:09.837 --> 59:11.464
- It's over.
You're safe.

59:11.547 --> 59:13.299
That's what matters, right?

59:15.468 --> 59:17.929
- What did you do?

59:18.012 --> 59:19.973
- What did you think
I would do?

59:33.236 --> 59:37.156
- Use the American.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.950
Is that all I am to you?

59:39.033 --> 59:42.328
Just an American you could use.
Give me bad information.

59:42.412 --> 59:43.621
- Huh?

59:43.705 --> 59:46.207
- Huh?

59:46.291 --> 59:48.334
- Don't look at me like that.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.253
Give me
a piece-of-shit tip, huh?

59:50.336 --> 59:51.754
- Keep your voice down.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.131
- There were no drugs
on the plane.

59:53.214 --> 59:55.508
- That cannot be.

59:55.591 --> 59:56.342
- Can't be?
What, were they invisible?

59:56.426 --> 59:59.095
- Hey, cool down.
- Cool down? No.

59:59.178 --> 1:00:02.181
He fucked me.
You fucked me!

1:00:02.265 --> 1:00:04.976
You really fucked me over.

1:00:05.059 --> 1:00:07.353
Or are you just
such a dumb fucking Yak

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:09.022
you didn't know the tip
you gave me was bad?

1:00:09.105 --> 1:00:10.857
Is that it?
You want to fucking go?

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.191
- Don't.
- You want to go?

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:13.693
Let's fucking go!
- Please don't!

1:00:13.776 --> 1:00:15.903
- You fucked my career!
- Jake, go home!

1:00:15.987 --> 1:00:17.280
- No cop will ever talk
to me again...

1:00:17.363 --> 1:00:19.032
- Go home!
- Because of you!

1:00:19.115 --> 1:00:20.616
Fuck you! I'll never trust
a fucking source again!

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.493
- You're gonna hurt yourself!
Please go home!

1:00:22.577 --> 1:00:23.703
- Wow, you guys are made
for each other, you know that?

1:00:23.786 --> 1:00:25.538
You make
a great fucking couple.

1:00:25.621 --> 1:00:27.040
Fuck you!

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:31.794
- Oh, God.
