[door opens]

01:11.158 --> 01:13.377
[running footsteps]

01:13.421 --> 01:15.684
- [boy] Come on.
Pass, pass. I'm open.
- [man] A little slower
in the hallway, please.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.817
-[boy 2] You're an idiot.
-[girl] What if no one asks me?
Like last year?

01:18.861 --> 01:21.255
-[boy 3] I'll get that, milady.

[piano music playing]

01:43.015 --> 01:44.365
[chuckles softly]

01:44.408 --> 01:46.149
[girl] You didn't tell me
you played piano.

01:46.889 --> 01:47.890
[Maren] Hey.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.633
You are here.
Where have you been?

01:51.676 --> 01:53.287
You weren't in Home Ec.
all week.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.158
I got to slip to work
on the yearbook.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
We missed our deadline
with Jostens.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.248
Oh. How's it look?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.773
You're not gonna be in it,
by the way.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.514
Mr. Esser said
he reminded you three times

02:03.558 --> 02:05.429
-to get your picture taken.
-[plays piano]

02:07.736 --> 02:09.433
Hey, so my dad's doing
inventory all night,

02:09.477 --> 02:11.348
and Kim and Jackie
are sleeping over.

02:11.827 --> 02:12.654
Come too.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.526
[continues playing piano]

02:15.570 --> 02:17.659
No, my dad won't let me.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.791
So sneak out.
After he goes to bed.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.533
How would I get there?

02:23.665 --> 02:24.970
You're down
in Southwind, right?

02:26.233 --> 02:27.538
You know the power lines
that go up the hill?

02:28.931 --> 02:31.151
That's Chesapeake Road
at the top. I'm right there.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.458
You said you wanna make
more friends here.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.289
[students chattering]

02:42.858 --> 02:44.990
Hey. Come on, you drive.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.514
-[boy] Okay.
-[girl] Take care. Bye.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.714
[men laughing and chattering]

03:16.674 --> 03:18.981
Hey. That was good
on the road.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.114
Gotta work on that parking
some more...

03:23.203 --> 03:24.073
but good.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.690
You think
it's gonna rain tonight?

03:34.518 --> 03:35.954
Don't think it's supposed to.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.441
[can pops open]

03:47.705 --> 03:49.707
[grunts] Got homework?

03:51.622 --> 03:52.623
Just reading, Dad.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.453
The man has attempted suicide.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.020
I think he realized

03:58.063 --> 04:01.545
that this scheme that
he had been involved in,

04:01.589 --> 04:04.679
about which he had
always been extremely guilty.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.812
I mean, he's... he's,
I think, the only person

04:07.856 --> 04:13.035
in this entire scheme to have
voluntarily walked out on it.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.865
Some people were annoyed
with it, upset with it,

04:16.908 --> 04:19.607
and... but went along with it.
Others enjoyed it

04:19.650 --> 04:21.522
because they were making
a lot of money out of it.

04:21.565 --> 04:25.700
Dowd was the only person
who had the character...

04:26.570 --> 04:27.876
'Night, Dad.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.356
[man on TV]
...and the moral fiber...

04:29.399 --> 04:30.792
Yeah. Sleep good.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.141
[man on TV]
...to walk out on this scheme

04:32.184 --> 04:33.534
long before anybody
knew about it,

04:33.577 --> 04:35.144
because it disgusted him.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.756
I mean,
the prospect of actually

04:38.800 --> 04:40.802
walking into
Donald Manes' office

04:40.845 --> 04:42.020
and paying him cash...

-[muffled chatter]

05:29.807 --> 05:31.243
[panting]

05:38.033 --> 05:39.121
Hang on. Okay.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.255
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:45.736 --> 05:48.304
You got prickers all over you.
Come in.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.961
[indistinct chatter]

05:55.050 --> 05:56.356
[Kim] So you can't
spend the night?

05:57.574 --> 05:58.967
[Maren] Not all night.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.751
I should be back
by 6:00 to be safe.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.406
Jesus.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.800
I'll just head out
when you guys wanna sleep.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.021
So where'd you move here
from anyway?

06:11.501 --> 06:12.546
Eastern shore.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.549
Is your mom in the picture?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.944
Sherry says
you only have a dad.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.206
[knock on table]

06:22.904 --> 06:24.384
"Cinnamon Glaze."

06:25.776 --> 06:26.777
We're trying to talk.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.304
[Sherry] Kim,
give me your hand.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.401
[Kim] Never mind
about your mom.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.315
It's none of my business,
anyway.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.407
[inhales deeply]

06:48.451 --> 06:50.410
I don't have
any memories of her.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.238
Or photos even.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.851
My dad wouldn't
tell me anything.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.813
Try that.
It's called "Copper Fever."

07:05.555 --> 07:06.730
It's too orange.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.394
-[bones crunching]
-[screaming]

07:20.396 --> 07:21.441
Oh, my God!

07:21.484 --> 07:22.964
Maren, stop it!

07:23.007 --> 07:24.487
Stop! Stop it!

07:24.531 --> 07:26.794
Maren, stop! Maren, no!

07:26.837 --> 07:27.751
-Jackie!
-[continues screaming]

07:27.795 --> 07:28.883
Maren, stop!

07:30.450 --> 07:32.626
Jackie! Jackie, help!

07:33.365 --> 07:34.454
Jackie, help!

07:36.107 --> 07:37.544
[panting]

07:51.558 --> 07:53.560
[banging on door]

07:56.693 --> 07:57.607
You didn't.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.569
In the car in three minutes.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.222
Whatever you can take
in three minutes.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.834
Go!

08:08.444 --> 08:09.619
Shit.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.540
Move, Maren!

08:17.584 --> 08:19.890
When the cops get here,
we have to be good and gone.

08:58.886 --> 08:59.756
Dad?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.238
[sighs]

09:04.631 --> 09:05.632
[yawning]

09:14.292 --> 09:15.119
Dad?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.131
[breathing heavily]

10:04.168 --> 10:04.995
[button clicks]

10:08.042 --> 10:09.696
[Maren's father on tape]
I've got some things to say.

10:09.739 --> 10:10.610
And then...

10:12.089 --> 10:14.657
I want you to make sure
this, uh...

10:14.701 --> 10:16.877
this tape is good
and destroyed. Don't keep it.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.183
This has got my voice on it.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.970
You're not going
to see me again, Maren.

10:26.756 --> 10:27.670
I can't...

10:30.673 --> 10:31.631
help you anymore.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.850
[Maren crying]

10:33.894 --> 10:36.810
I can't do anything else,
either.

10:36.853 --> 10:40.727
Call the cops or whatever
somebody might do in my place.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.992
So I gotta leave you
to figure it out for yourself.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.995
Like your mother did.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.562
I'm sorry. You know
what I mean now.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.348
I don't know how much...

10:53.391 --> 10:56.568
how much of what I'm gonna say
you'll remember.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.660
[sighs] Yeah. Never was sure.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.227
But just in case,

11:03.271 --> 11:04.664
I'll tell you
everything I know.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.450
First time was
when you were three.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.283
[indistinct talking on TV]

11:15.326 --> 11:17.154
[newscaster]
Downey has the crowd screaming

11:17.198 --> 11:18.895
at Towson State University.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.984
The topic was
the most controversial issue

11:21.028 --> 11:22.725
on this year's
Maryland ballot,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.161
the gun ban referendum.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.641
The majority of those
in the audience

11:25.685 --> 11:27.251
seem to be against the ban,

11:27.295 --> 11:28.775
but we found those
on both sides of the issue.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.124
[woman] I think
it's a good law,

11:30.167 --> 11:31.603
if she gets
guns off the streets,

11:31.647 --> 11:33.518
and that's what we need most.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.172
[man] I just
don't think it's fair

11:35.216 --> 11:37.044
for all the innocent people
that wanna get a gun

11:37.087 --> 11:39.089
to protect themselves.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.484
Just making it easier for
criminals to have them than
honest people.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.226
[man 2] I don't want them comin'
in my living room and tell me
what I can and can't buy.

11:45.269 --> 11:46.967
Y'all think if you take
the guns away from everybody,

11:47.010 --> 11:49.056
you have less shooting
with the whole nine-yards,

11:49.099 --> 11:51.101
the criminals
and the innocent people.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.327
Hi.

12:00.023 --> 12:00.850
Uh...

12:02.722 --> 12:03.723
I need to get here.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.683
What's the closest
I can get by bus?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.338
Well, looks like
Detroit Lakes.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.473
Three transfers.

12:15.517 --> 12:19.260
Frederick, Maryland,
Columbus and Minneapolis.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.220
One way? 83.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.441
How much to Columbus?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.663
Shouldn't you be in school?

12:32.926 --> 12:34.362
You'd think.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.929
I don't know what that means.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.410
Means I'm 18,
in the state of Maryland,

12:39.454 --> 12:41.369
and I can decide for myself
where I should be.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.940
I'm gonna need to see
a driver's license
or a learner's permit.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.466
You can see
a birth certificate.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.339
Come on.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.089
Just to Columbus?

13:06.655 --> 13:07.656
It's 49.

13:09.005 --> 13:09.876
50.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.838
[passengers chattering]

13:27.676 --> 13:29.243
[Maren's father]
I had a sitter for you then.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.333
[chuckles] Her name was Penny.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.989
When I came in,
she was on the bathroom floor.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.166
There was... so much blood.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.256
Her face was chewed up bad,

13:42.299 --> 13:46.390
but the worst of it
was her neck.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.872
She must've been holding you
when you started in on her.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.526
Her hands, all chewed up. I...

13:51.569 --> 13:54.877
I thought you were dead too.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.052
That somebody
had done you both,

13:56.096 --> 13:58.098
but you were sleepin'.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.448
When I turned you over,
I saw the blood on your mouth.

14:00.491 --> 14:04.887
You had something
in your cheek.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.890
I fished it out. It was soft,
like a wad of gum.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
It had a little hole in it.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.807
Where an earring would go.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.203
I remember thanking God
she hadn't been wearing any,

14:16.246 --> 14:17.204
you could've choked.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.816
I got the body out,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.122
I bleached the place
three times,

14:22.165 --> 14:23.427
and then packed us up
and left.

14:24.559 --> 14:25.995
They never found
where I put her.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.870
That was the last time
I used our real last name.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.829
Now you know why.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.136
Nothin' happened
for a few years. I relaxed.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.095
You had to start school
and I thought...

14:39.139 --> 14:41.184
I thought you wouldn't
do it in public,

14:41.228 --> 14:42.098
and you didn't.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.144
But you got clever.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.798
So fucking clever.

14:58.723 --> 14:59.899
[sighs]

14:59.942 --> 15:01.248
[thunder rumbling]

15:21.964 --> 15:23.923
[rain pattering]

15:38.502 --> 15:40.243
[thunder continues rumbling]

16:09.098 --> 16:11.057
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.711
[breathing shakily]

16:15.104 --> 16:16.279
You waiting for the bus?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.805
Well, no, missy. I...

16:21.719 --> 16:23.417
I came lookin' for you.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.204
Do I know you?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.992
I guess not in the way
you mean.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.040
I smelled you.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.695
You probably smell me now.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.525
When was the last time
you fed?

16:46.701 --> 16:47.963
[thunder rumbling]

16:51.184 --> 16:52.707
[sniffs]

16:52.750 --> 16:54.970
[Maren] Stop, stop,
stop there. Stop.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.933
You haven't in a long time.
[sniffs]

17:01.977 --> 17:02.934
I'll say...

17:05.111 --> 17:06.373
many months.

17:07.591 --> 17:08.592
At least.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.856
You can smell that?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.771
[chuckles] Oh, sure.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.860
You can...

17:15.904 --> 17:19.734
You can smell lots of things
if you know how.

17:19.777 --> 17:20.604
[sniffs]

17:21.866 --> 17:25.044
And we just smell anyway.
[laughs]

17:26.175 --> 17:28.438
Whether we ate or not.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.200
Hmm.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.166
Come on, missy.

18:02.864 --> 18:03.691
Come on.

18:13.788 --> 18:14.615
Come on.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.056
[Maren] Where are we goin'?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.537
Just here,
someplace dry and safe.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.366
I'm Sullivan.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.325
Friends call me Sully.

18:30.892 --> 18:31.762
Maren.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.548
Is this your house?

18:36.985 --> 18:38.552
Listen, Maren,

18:38.595 --> 18:40.684
don't worry. I'm okay.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.165
I got rules.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.559
One, number one

18:45.602 --> 18:49.389
is never, never, ever
eat an Eater.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.130
Think you can follow that too?

18:52.783 --> 18:53.915
All right.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.786
I'll fix some dinner for us.

18:58.311 --> 19:02.489
I smelled you from the yard,
little missy. Come on.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.099
This far?

19:05.796 --> 19:08.364
[Sully] Round the back.
We'll talk inside.

19:40.396 --> 19:44.183
The Sully, he found
these little Cornish hens

19:45.706 --> 19:46.707
in the freezer.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.014
These hens,

19:51.668 --> 19:53.670
they look like
they had a good life.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.591
Thought I was the only one.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
Are there lots of us?

20:04.899 --> 20:05.943
Not lots.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.555
But more...

20:09.991 --> 20:11.775
more than you'd think.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.778
You've met a few, sure,
that you know of.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.172
[bones snapping]

20:17.216 --> 20:21.132
You never had anyone
take a interest in you?

20:21.176 --> 20:23.744
[stutters] A double take?

20:23.787 --> 20:24.788
[chuckles]

20:25.876 --> 20:27.095
Just always thought--

20:27.138 --> 20:31.665
You just thought
some people are creepy.

20:31.708 --> 20:36.409
It's better if we all
steer clear of one another.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.629
We're dangerous to non-Eaters,

20:39.673 --> 20:44.634
but we can hurt
one another just as bad.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.071
I hope you're
hearing me on this.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.943
[thunder rumbling]

20:50.336 --> 20:52.033
You sound like my dad.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
Your daddy find out about you?

20:59.693 --> 21:00.694
What about you?

21:02.348 --> 21:05.394
You basically just said
steer clear of people like us.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.789
But you came looking for me.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.269
[chuckling]

21:10.312 --> 21:11.661
Smart.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.145
When I saw you're just
a girl on your own,

21:19.234 --> 21:20.061
I thought...

21:22.890 --> 21:24.413
you might be hungry.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.243
For hens?

21:30.071 --> 21:31.899
[breathing heavily]

21:34.902 --> 21:36.251
No.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.359
Who lives here?

21:59.535 --> 22:00.971
Well, go and look.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.896
[Maren sniffing]

22:14.202 --> 22:15.595
Use your nose.

22:16.596 --> 22:17.858
What do you smell?

22:19.425 --> 22:20.513
Is there someone
dead up there?

22:21.122 --> 22:22.645
What do you smell?

22:24.081 --> 22:25.387
Describe it.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.349
Metallic.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.091
Like blood?

22:37.181 --> 22:38.444
No, like mud.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.100
Something tangy.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.236
But not like rotten.

22:49.933 --> 22:50.804
No.

22:54.634 --> 22:55.635
But close.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.377
More like vinegar.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.251
Like vinegar in the soup.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.907
Yeah. Yeah.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.658
[Maren sniffing]

23:38.939 --> 23:40.767
-She's alive.
-[Sully] Missy.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.290
-We'll get help.
-Missy.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.509
What did you do to her?

23:43.552 --> 23:45.424
I found her like that
this mornin'.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.426
You're lying. Let me by.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.211
Listen.
Let me bone down on this.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.431
Whatever you and I got,

23:53.214 --> 23:54.781
it's gotta be fed.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.435
[breathing shakily]

23:58.219 --> 23:59.394
No. Uh...

24:00.874 --> 24:02.397
No, 'cause it was...

24:04.181 --> 24:06.749
It was years
before my last time.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.099
[sighs]
That's because you're young.

24:11.275 --> 24:14.148
You're gonna need it
more and more,

24:14.191 --> 24:16.672
-and more and more.
-[whimpering]

24:16.716 --> 24:21.068
And you won't always be able
to hold yourself back.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.462
But if the circumstances is...

24:24.027 --> 24:26.029
is safe and good,

24:27.248 --> 24:28.336
then eat.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.078
It'll last a while,

24:31.121 --> 24:33.994
maybe it'll keep you from,

24:34.037 --> 24:36.431
you know,
doing something you'll regret.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.696
[Maren continues whimpering]

24:41.131 --> 24:42.393
Even more.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.048
Even more, missy.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.532
Yes, Sully found her that way.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.621
I followed my nose.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.888
I don't...
I don't kill people.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.110
At least I try not to.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.593
That leaves this.

a few minutes, please?

25:26.133 --> 25:27.177
Sure, you can.

25:31.617 --> 25:34.576
I don't think
it'll be a long time now.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.100
When the time comes,
you'll smell it.

This is how I do it.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.496
It helps me
to remember each one.

27:52.540 --> 27:56.065
When I began this,
I was about your age.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.244
Pull it.

28:02.506 --> 28:03.682
You won't break it.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.734
It's strong. [laughs]

28:12.778 --> 28:15.302
[Maren] Who was your first?
You remember?

28:18.392 --> 28:20.133
I ate my own granddad

28:22.135 --> 28:24.398
while they were waiting
on the undertaker.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.924
Did anyone find you
while you were doing it?

28:28.968 --> 28:30.099
My mama.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.973
My mama found me afterwards.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.105
Cleaned me up.

28:38.673 --> 28:42.111
She told everyone
animals got in and did it.

28:42.155 --> 28:45.027
But when I finally ran off,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.727
no one came looking for me.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.735
[Maren] And you've been
on your own since then?

29:01.914 --> 29:03.002
It's not hard...

29:05.700 --> 29:07.223
once someone teaches you.

29:08.572 --> 29:09.486
[sniffs]

29:11.358 --> 29:13.360
But you don't...
you don't, uh...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.450
you don't need to be alone.

29:17.843 --> 29:20.454
You can bond with me
as long as you like.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.765
I'm looking for someone.

29:29.593 --> 29:30.638
Your mama.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.641
You mentioned
your daddy last night,

29:33.684 --> 29:34.990
so I knew he was
in the picture.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.731
You must be runnin' from him

29:37.906 --> 29:39.473
or he left you or somethin'.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.953

about your mama, though.

I never met her.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.702
All I have is the name of
the town she was born in.

It's on my birth certificate.

Mm-hmm.

1:05:39.152 --> 1:05:41.024
Except in my case,
I gave him the tape.

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.287
[footsteps approaching]

1:05:48.596 --> 1:05:49.728
Just give me
a couple of minutes.

1:06:12.142 --> 1:06:13.491
You made it.

1:06:13.534 --> 1:06:15.145
-[Lee] This is a good spot.
-Yeah, it's not bad.

1:06:15.188 --> 1:06:16.320
[Lee] There's no one here.

1:06:16.363 --> 1:06:17.625
-[man] Is that you?
-[Lee] Yeah.

1:06:17.669 --> 1:06:18.800
-[man] It's a nice truck.
-[Lee] Great, huh?

1:06:18.844 --> 1:06:20.193
[man] Yeah, she is.
I'm parked up there.

1:06:20.237 --> 1:06:21.064
Do you smoke?

1:06:23.762 --> 1:06:24.763
What are you laughing about?

1:06:26.025 --> 1:06:27.287
-Do you smoke weed too?
-[Lee] Yeah.

1:06:37.341 --> 1:06:38.907
[man chuckles]
You kinky fucker.

1:06:40.997 --> 1:06:42.128
[both laughing]

1:06:44.522 --> 1:06:45.479
[rustling]

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:55.924
[man moaning]

1:06:58.014 --> 1:06:59.145
[man] Oh, yeah.

1:06:59.189 --> 1:07:01.060
Faster, man.
Jerk it faster. Come on.

1:07:01.104 --> 1:07:03.802
I'm close, yeah.
Yeah, like that.

1:07:03.845 --> 1:07:05.325
[man breathing rapidly]

1:07:07.588 --> 1:07:08.720
Come on, come on, faster, man.

1:07:08.763 --> 1:07:10.591
Faster, faster.
[inhales sharply]

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:16.249
Oh, yeah.

1:07:17.337 --> 1:07:19.557
[unnerving music playing]

1:07:20.123 --> 1:07:21.341
Oh, fuck!

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:23.430
Oh.

1:07:28.522 --> 1:07:30.176
[man breathing rapidly]

1:07:31.264 --> 1:07:32.787
Faster, jerk it faster, man.
Come on.

1:07:35.094 --> 1:07:37.227
Yeah, I'm close. I'm close.

1:07:37.270 --> 1:07:38.837
Just like that.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:41.666
I'm close, I'm close.
Here it comes. Here it comes.

1:07:41.709 --> 1:07:43.059
That sure feels... [gasps]

1:07:44.147 --> 1:07:46.018
-[body thuds]
-[Lee breathing heavily]

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:50.240
[man choking and gurgling]

1:07:50.283 --> 1:07:52.720
-[Lee panting]
-[gagging]

1:07:56.159 --> 1:07:57.986
[munching]

1:08:16.179 --> 1:08:17.658
[radio host]
The world in the spring

1:08:17.702 --> 1:08:19.530
and a new skateboard
from Bikes Unlimited.

1:08:19.573 --> 1:08:21.314
[tuning radio]

1:08:21.358 --> 1:08:23.882
[radio host 2] Don't you love
the smell of black rubber?

1:08:28.495 --> 1:08:30.018
Maybe not.

1:08:30.062 --> 1:08:32.717
It's an acquired taste.

1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:34.588
Some people
never get used to it.

1:08:35.372 --> 1:08:36.851
Don't really understand.

1:08:39.332 --> 1:08:41.029
Oh, you can work your way up.

1:08:47.384 --> 1:08:49.386
[radio chatter
continues indistinctly]

1:08:50.865 --> 1:08:52.867
What's wrong?

1:08:52.911 --> 1:08:54.608
[Lee] That's the place
listed on his license,

1:08:54.652 --> 1:08:55.870
but the lights are on.

1:08:58.264 --> 1:08:59.744
I'm gonna go back
and see if anyone's there.

1:08:59.787 --> 1:09:01.963
No, no, I'll go, I'll go.
You have blood on you.

1:09:03.443 --> 1:09:05.750
I cleaned up.
He had wipes in the car.

1:09:05.793 --> 1:09:07.055
You can take them if you want.

1:09:11.059 --> 1:09:12.800
I'll see what I can see
from the yard.

1:09:15.890 --> 1:09:16.761
Okay.

1:09:21.896 --> 1:09:25.117
[radio host 2] All black.
Completely hidden.

1:09:26.727 --> 1:09:29.991
In my black cocoon,
I'm where no one can find me.

1:09:54.364 --> 1:09:55.800
[Maren panting]

1:09:57.367 --> 1:09:58.368
Maren, you okay?

1:10:00.283 --> 1:10:01.240
What are you doing?

1:10:05.070 --> 1:10:07.551
What? Oh, Christ.

1:10:07.594 --> 1:10:08.943
Okay, we didn't know.

1:10:09.988 --> 1:10:12.208
Hey, we didn't know,
okay? [tuts]

1:10:18.475 --> 1:10:19.693
[woman 1] Is he back?

1:10:19.737 --> 1:10:21.739
[woman 2] No!
Something's wrong, Mom!

1:10:21.782 --> 1:10:23.262
All right, we gotta go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:24.698
Focus, focus.
Come on, let's go.

1:10:43.935 --> 1:10:47.939
[radio host] Only there
did civilization arise.

1:10:47.982 --> 1:10:51.029
Now, it's not my intention
to give a history lesson,

1:10:51.072 --> 1:10:53.553
but I believe it's important
to remind ourselves

1:10:53.597 --> 1:10:55.033
that in dealing
with the economy,

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:57.035
we're dealing with
human creativity.

1:10:57.992 --> 1:10:59.429
This insight has represented

1:10:59.472 --> 1:11:01.692
the underpinning of
our economic expansion.

1:11:02.910 --> 1:11:04.347
There wasn't
a car seat, Maren.

1:11:05.565 --> 1:11:06.871
He wasn't wearing
a wedding ring.

1:11:09.395 --> 1:11:10.570
We should feel something.

1:11:11.441 --> 1:11:12.877
'Cause we murder people.

1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:15.140
We steal their stuff,
we move the fuck on,

1:11:15.183 --> 1:11:16.620
and we ruin lives
that we don't even see.

1:11:16.663 --> 1:11:18.012
Come on, why are we talking
about it like this?

1:11:18.056 --> 1:11:19.884
We gotta do this!
We have to do it!

1:11:20.711 --> 1:11:22.452
[sniffles]

1:11:22.495 --> 1:11:24.541
[Maren]
Talking about the future,

1:11:24.584 --> 1:11:26.934
talking about being
a friend to yourself.

1:11:26.978 --> 1:11:29.763
You don't have that.
This is too much.

1:11:31.417 --> 1:11:35.769
No, we got
60, 70 years of this?

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:40.731
How dare you make this harder.

1:11:50.393 --> 1:11:51.916
Maren, what do I...
What am I supposed...

1:11:52.395 --> 1:11:53.787
How do I get you out of this?

1:11:53.831 --> 1:11:54.962
What am I supposed to say
right now?

1:11:57.225 --> 1:11:58.270
Just drive.

1:11:58.879 --> 1:12:01.317
Right. All right.

1:12:13.764 --> 1:12:15.722
[Maren breathing heavily]

1:12:20.553 --> 1:12:21.772
[gasping]

1:12:24.644 --> 1:12:27.081
[Lee] You were dreaming.
We're almost there.

1:12:28.909 --> 1:12:29.997
[chuckles]

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:35.960
[patrons chattering]

1:12:38.484 --> 1:12:41.835
Uh, do have a telephone book?
The one outside's missing.

1:12:42.270 --> 1:12:43.402
Uh...

1:12:43.446 --> 1:12:45.709
I'm looking for someone
in Bagley.

1:12:45.752 --> 1:12:48.059
Oh. This is for
the county, sweetie.

1:12:56.633 --> 1:12:58.069
[breathing heavily]

1:12:59.723 --> 1:13:01.072
[Maren] Thanks.

1:13:04.423 --> 1:13:05.337
There.

1:13:14.999 --> 1:13:17.088
-I'll come with you.
-No, stay here.

1:13:29.622 --> 1:13:31.755
Excuse me?
Are you Barbara Kerns?

1:13:40.459 --> 1:13:42.418
Wait, wait. Ms. Kerns.
Ms. Kerns.

1:13:42.940 --> 1:13:44.332
I'm Maren Yearly.

1:13:44.637 --> 1:13:45.508
Maren.

1:13:47.031 --> 1:13:48.728
I've traveled a very long way.

1:13:57.563 --> 1:13:59.260
Oh, they didn't marry.

1:13:59.304 --> 1:14:00.740
Hmm. Yeah, we wondered.

1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:02.307
Huh.

1:14:04.135 --> 1:14:08.139
My husband, uh,
he died years ago.

1:14:08.182 --> 1:14:09.793
Throat cancer.

1:14:09.836 --> 1:14:12.186
-Sorry.
-Mm.

1:14:12.230 --> 1:14:14.058
Sorry to surprise you
like this.

1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:18.715
You didn't know your daughter
had a child, I guess.

1:14:19.672 --> 1:14:21.326
No.

1:14:21.369 --> 1:14:23.981
No. When she wanted
to get married,

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:25.765
we didn't agree.

1:14:26.853 --> 1:14:29.900
So, it drove her away. Yeah.

1:14:32.859 --> 1:14:34.644
Where did she meet my dad?

1:14:36.428 --> 1:14:37.429
He didn't say?

1:14:38.952 --> 1:14:40.780
He wouldn't say
anything about her.

1:14:42.129 --> 1:14:43.043
Ah.

1:14:44.001 --> 1:14:45.959
Hmm. Mm.

1:14:48.092 --> 1:14:49.049
[sighs]

1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:00.496
They met in college.
Down in Mankato.

1:15:01.671 --> 1:15:02.846
She finished two years

1:15:02.889 --> 1:15:04.543
before he talked her
into leaving.

1:15:06.327 --> 1:15:08.678
Did he drive you here?
Is he outside?

1:15:08.721 --> 1:15:11.071
No. He's in Maryland.

1:15:14.684 --> 1:15:16.686
Does he know you're here?

1:15:16.729 --> 1:15:18.339
Yeah, he let me know
where to find you.

1:15:19.515 --> 1:15:20.864
So you haven't run away?

1:15:21.473 --> 1:15:22.561
No.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:23.693
My dad thinks that

1:15:23.736 --> 1:15:24.955
I'm old enough
to live on my own.

1:15:25.825 --> 1:15:27.610
Oh. Uh-huh.

1:15:27.653 --> 1:15:30.526
Well, if you're looking for
a home with your mother,

1:15:31.875 --> 1:15:32.832
um,

1:15:33.616 --> 1:15:35.748
I'm sorry to tell you

1:15:35.792 --> 1:15:38.229
that she...
she's no longer with us.

1:15:41.232 --> 1:15:42.886
What? When?

1:15:42.929 --> 1:15:44.452
It's a lot of years now,

1:15:44.496 --> 1:15:46.890
and it's nothing
I wanna tell you about.

1:15:46.933 --> 1:15:48.369
I hope you can respect that.

1:15:48.413 --> 1:15:49.545
Well, I'm her daughter.

1:15:50.807 --> 1:15:52.635
Yep. Makes sense now.

1:15:52.678 --> 1:15:56.769
Why she came back so bereaved.
That's the word.

1:15:57.901 --> 1:16:00.164
And she wouldn't tell us
anything, either.

1:16:01.426 --> 1:16:05.430
Oh, it's just so much hiding
in one family.

1:16:06.910 --> 1:16:09.303
I'm sorry you had to be
the child of it all.

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:13.873
Wait. What was
she like as a child?

1:16:16.441 --> 1:16:17.442
Hmm.

1:16:23.709 --> 1:16:25.755
Wow. She was your only child?

1:16:25.798 --> 1:16:27.583
[Barbara] Well, not even ours.

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:30.194
Bob and I never could have
babies of our own.

1:16:31.456 --> 1:16:33.240
But then we heard
about Janelle.

1:16:34.111 --> 1:16:35.591
She'd been left behind

1:16:35.634 --> 1:16:38.158
a sheriff's station
in Bemidji.

1:16:38.202 --> 1:16:40.030
It was in the paper.

1:16:40.073 --> 1:16:42.685
You know anything
about her biological parents?

1:16:42.728 --> 1:16:43.903
No, nothing.

1:16:43.947 --> 1:16:46.123
Except what they did
to their baby.

1:16:46.166 --> 1:16:48.691
I mean, she could have froze,
you know.

1:16:48.734 --> 1:16:50.475
It's cold here all the time.

1:16:52.782 --> 1:16:54.348
My mother...

1:16:54.392 --> 1:16:57.003
You can, you know, take those
photos if you want 'em.

1:16:57.047 --> 1:16:58.352
Did she ever hurt anyone?

1:17:00.093 --> 1:17:01.617
What kind of question is that?

1:17:03.270 --> 1:17:06.883
I bet she did. I know she did.

1:17:06.926 --> 1:17:08.798
I don't know what you had
to do to cover it up

1:17:08.841 --> 1:17:11.278
or... how much pain
it caused you.

1:17:11.322 --> 1:17:12.932
Stop this. At once.

1:17:12.976 --> 1:17:15.674
Look, you're never
going to see me again, okay?

1:17:15.718 --> 1:17:19.112
You may not be her family
by blood, but I am.

1:17:19.156 --> 1:17:20.287
And I need to know.

1:17:20.331 --> 1:17:23.073
So, please, Mrs. Kerns,
please...

1:17:23.116 --> 1:17:24.640
Then ask her yourself.

1:17:28.295 --> 1:17:29.253
How?

1:17:32.038 --> 1:17:32.952
[sighs]

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:36.347
Look, I don't know you.

1:17:36.390 --> 1:17:37.783
You gotta understand.

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:40.003
I didn't know what you wanted
comin' up here.

1:17:40.046 --> 1:17:41.395
And I hope you mean
what you say

1:17:41.439 --> 1:17:43.571
about never coming back here.

1:17:43.615 --> 1:17:48.359
I know that sounds cold,
but I wanna be clear with ya.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:50.578
I told you she was
no longer with us,

1:17:50.622 --> 1:17:53.059
but she's not...
she's not dead.

1:17:55.061 --> 1:17:58.325
She's living in a town
called Fergus Falls.

1:17:59.065 --> 1:18:00.458
In a state hospital there.

1:18:00.501 --> 1:18:02.852
And we didn't put her there,

1:18:02.895 --> 1:18:04.549
if that's what
you're thinkin'.

1:18:04.592 --> 1:18:06.594
She signed her own papers.

1:18:06.638 --> 1:18:07.552
[door opens]

1:18:09.510 --> 1:18:10.511
[door closes]

1:18:19.085 --> 1:18:20.347
[panting] Okay.

1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:32.925
Here. My mother's here.

1:19:13.705 --> 1:19:14.662
Do you want me to come in?

1:19:15.576 --> 1:19:16.447
No.

1:19:38.817 --> 1:19:40.906
[nurse] Mrs. Kerns' daughter.

1:19:40.950 --> 1:19:43.953
I sure didn't expect this
when I woke up this morning.

1:19:45.737 --> 1:19:47.086
[muffled shouting]

1:19:48.435 --> 1:19:49.828
[woman screaming]

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:51.177
[woman 2] Calm down.

1:19:53.658 --> 1:19:54.702
Calm down.

1:19:55.399 --> 1:19:57.836
Is she dangerous?

1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:00.230
It's been many years
since that was a concern.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:02.058
[woman 3 crying]

1:20:03.973 --> 1:20:05.322
Why was it ever one?

1:20:05.365 --> 1:20:08.499
Aggression towards the staff.
Self-harm.

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:10.762
But long ago.

1:20:12.895 --> 1:20:14.853
[keys jingling]

1:20:14.897 --> 1:20:17.247
It's possible she won't
understand who you are.

1:20:18.378 --> 1:20:19.902
She just took
her morning meds,

1:20:19.945 --> 1:20:21.642
so she may nod off anyhow.

1:20:22.208 --> 1:20:24.254
We'll see.

1:20:24.297 --> 1:20:26.430
There's someone here
to see you, Ms. Kerns.

1:20:26.473 --> 1:20:29.389
A surprise.
A wonderful surprise.

1:20:54.719 --> 1:20:55.676
[Maren] It's Maren.

1:20:57.591 --> 1:20:58.418
I'm Maren.

1:21:03.859 --> 1:21:04.903
Can't she speak?

1:21:04.947 --> 1:21:06.078
It's the medication.

1:21:07.775 --> 1:21:10.213
[whimpers, breathing shakily]

1:21:10.256 --> 1:21:11.997
Easy, Ms. Kerns.

1:21:16.436 --> 1:21:17.960
I didn't come with Dad.

1:21:19.962 --> 1:21:22.703
I didn't come with Dad.
Just came by myself.

1:21:25.271 --> 1:21:26.577
Should I give her
the letter, Ms. Kerns?

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:27.970
I fetched it on the way up.

1:21:28.013 --> 1:21:30.015
[whimpering]

1:21:34.802 --> 1:21:38.545
She wrote this about
15 years ago now, must be.

1:21:38.589 --> 1:21:41.940
I've kept it safe in her file
out there, in case.

1:21:48.991 --> 1:21:49.992
She knew I'd come?

1:21:51.907 --> 1:21:53.082
I'll wait right over here.

1:22:06.095 --> 1:22:11.317
[Janelle] Maren, if a day comes
when you show up here,

1:22:11.361 --> 1:22:15.104
I'll know it's because
your father broke his promise.

1:22:16.192 --> 1:22:18.020
Told you something about me.

1:22:19.412 --> 1:22:21.632
And I'll know why.

1:22:21.675 --> 1:22:24.678
He didn't know what I was
when we married,

1:22:24.722 --> 1:22:28.639
but he figured it out
by the time I had you.

1:22:28.682 --> 1:22:31.772
I promised I would never hurt
either of you,

1:22:31.816 --> 1:22:35.080
but how could we be sure?

1:22:35.124 --> 1:22:38.954
It wasn't easy to leave.
I loved you both so much.

1:22:38.997 --> 1:22:40.912
I thought about
ending my life,

1:22:40.956 --> 1:22:45.569
but I wanted to be here
in case you ever did come.

1:22:47.049 --> 1:22:50.400
All I ever wanted
in this world was love.

1:22:50.443 --> 1:22:53.011
I tried, believed,

1:22:53.055 --> 1:22:55.448
but we can't have it
as we are.

1:22:55.492 --> 1:22:57.973
All we can have
is a little space,

1:22:58.016 --> 1:23:02.238
with bars or a door
that locks.

1:23:02.281 --> 1:23:05.241
[tearfully] I'm sorry
for that, Little Yearly.

1:23:06.546 --> 1:23:09.680
For all the things
I didn't do for you

1:23:09.723 --> 1:23:13.553
and for the one thing
I still can.

1:23:14.424 --> 1:23:15.903

1:23:15.947 --> 1:23:18.515

1:23:31.615 --> 1:23:32.877
[Maren] No! Help me!

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:34.835
Ms. Kerns, calm down!

1:23:35.619 --> 1:23:37.490
Maren, die.

1:23:39.275 --> 1:23:40.319
[Maren] Let me out. Let me out.

1:23:40.363 --> 1:23:42.060
Press the button
on the door. Go!

[door rattling]

1:23:55.030 --> 1:23:56.901
I can't open the door.
I can't open the door.

1:23:56.944 --> 1:23:58.207
[Lee] Sorry, sorry.
Here we go, here we go.

1:23:58.250 --> 1:24:00.513
[Maren] I can't
fucking with the door.

1:24:00.557 --> 1:24:01.862
[Lee] You're good.

1:24:01.906 --> 1:24:03.821
[Maren] She's one of us.

1:24:03.864 --> 1:24:05.301
She's one of us
but she's fucking nuts.

1:24:05.344 --> 1:24:07.129
She ate her own fucking hands.

1:24:07.172 --> 1:24:08.304
She said she loved my dad.

1:24:08.347 --> 1:24:09.827
She said she wanted
to be a mom.

1:24:10.828 --> 1:24:12.177
She could have stayed.

1:24:12.221 --> 1:24:14.571
She could have told me
what I needed to know.

1:24:14.614 --> 1:24:16.138
But all of this...
Fuck, you know how different

1:24:16.181 --> 1:24:18.488
this would've been if I'd had
one person on my side?

1:24:18.531 --> 1:24:20.664
One person to talk to?

1:24:20.707 --> 1:24:22.100
You know what
I wouldn't have done?

1:24:22.144 --> 1:24:24.581
Maybe, probably half
of what I've fucking done!

1:24:25.495 --> 1:24:27.105
Fuck her. Fuck.

1:24:27.149 --> 1:24:29.151
[Lee] You know,
if she'd stayed,

1:24:29.194 --> 1:24:31.240
she might have hurt you,
Maren. Or worse, you might not
even be here right now.

1:24:33.111 --> 1:24:34.852
Trust me, I know what I'm
talking about with this stuff.

1:24:34.895 --> 1:24:36.549
This is better than
what I went through.

1:24:36.593 --> 1:24:38.290
Please just stop
fucking talking!

1:24:40.031 --> 1:24:41.989
You're pissed off,
and you're scared,
and you feel alone,

1:24:42.033 --> 1:24:43.643
and you don't know what to do
with it all, it's fine.

1:24:43.687 --> 1:24:45.950
If you wanna go at yourself
with that, I can't stop you.

1:24:46.733 --> 1:24:47.734
But don't come at me.

1:24:48.909 --> 1:24:51.173
You slit his throat, Lee.

1:24:51.216 --> 1:24:53.610
-He had a wife. Kids.
-Okay.

1:24:53.653 --> 1:24:55.438
I think you got used
to being locked up

1:24:55.481 --> 1:24:57.266
and invisible and alone,
and now you're
out in the world...

1:24:57.309 --> 1:24:58.789
-Okay, okay.
-...and you're seeing yourself

1:24:58.832 --> 1:25:01.096
for the first time,
and that's freaking you out.

1:25:01.139 --> 1:25:03.141
But you know what?
It's fucking me up too, okay?

1:25:03.185 --> 1:25:05.012
I feel like
I'm seeing myself too.
That's how this works.

1:25:05.056 --> 1:25:06.623
-How what works?
-This!

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:07.667
Whatever this is.

1:25:11.236 --> 1:25:13.151
Stop. You're wrong,
you're wrong.

1:25:13.195 --> 1:25:14.631
What? About which part
am I wrong?

1:25:14.674 --> 1:25:17.112
I can't be around you anymore.
I can't think.

We don't have
many options, Maren.

1:25:20.419 --> 1:25:22.334
Either you eat,
you off yourself,

1:25:22.378 --> 1:25:24.206
or you lock yourself up
like her in there.

1:25:24.249 --> 1:25:25.207
What's it gonna be?

let me have this?

right fucking now.

to say our goodbyes.

1:36:31.829 --> 1:36:33.048
[muffled shouting]

1:36:35.485 --> 1:36:37.269
[struggling grunts]

1:36:40.882 --> 1:36:42.797
[man screaming]

1:36:44.755 --> 1:36:45.800
[gasps]

1:36:47.671 --> 1:36:48.846
[breath trembling]

1:36:52.894 --> 1:36:54.721
-[music playing inside]
-[line ringing]

1:36:56.941 --> 1:36:58.160
[Kayla] Hello?

1:36:58.203 --> 1:37:00.336
[Lee] Hey, idiot,
how are you doin'?

1:37:00.379 --> 1:37:01.685
Is it too late to call?

1:37:01.728 --> 1:37:03.339
Where are you?
You sound weird.

1:37:04.906 --> 1:37:06.342
I'm driving home, actually.

1:37:09.388 --> 1:37:10.650
Will you be here tonight?

1:37:10.694 --> 1:37:12.000
Yeah, I'll be there
super late,

1:37:12.043 --> 1:37:13.653
but yeah, I'll get there.

1:37:13.697 --> 1:37:14.785
Can you stay?

1:37:17.353 --> 1:37:18.745
This time, I can. Yeah.

1:37:18.789 --> 1:37:20.530
-I'm really glad, Lee.
-[laughs]

1:37:20.573 --> 1:37:22.880
Me too.

1:37:22.924 --> 1:37:24.926
Hey, what do you think about
hittin' the kingdom
when I'm back?

1:37:24.969 --> 1:37:26.492
Going for a drive
or something, huh?

1:37:32.150 --> 1:37:33.238
Are you crying?

1:37:34.196 --> 1:37:35.675
No. What?

1:37:35.719 --> 1:37:37.112
Are... Are you in trouble?

1:37:37.155 --> 1:37:39.070
No, I'm driving home.
I'm good.

1:37:41.290 --> 1:37:43.770
-[exhales heavily]
-Can I tell Mom you're coming?

1:37:45.947 --> 1:37:47.035
Sure you can.

1:37:49.167 --> 1:37:50.168
Sure.

1:37:51.778 --> 1:37:53.911
-[line disconnects]
-[breathes deeply]

1:38:06.881 --> 1:38:09.840
I don't even care
about chores.

1:38:09.884 --> 1:38:11.537
-[LAUGHTER]
-That's all I care about.

1:38:11.581 --> 1:38:12.887
-It's so...
-You're right.

1:38:12.930 --> 1:38:14.192
[Kayla] I mean,
I cared about it before,

1:38:14.236 --> 1:38:15.802
-but not anymore.
-[girl] Yeah. Exactly.

1:38:15.846 --> 1:38:16.760
Hey, Kayla.

1:38:19.415 --> 1:38:21.460
I'm Maren, Lee's friend.

1:38:21.504 --> 1:38:23.593
I met you at your aunt's house
a couple of months back.

1:38:25.551 --> 1:38:26.465
I remember.

1:38:27.989 --> 1:38:29.425
I'll talk to y'all
in a minute.

1:38:31.122 --> 1:38:33.385
[Maren] Yeah, I wanted
to say hi then, but...

1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:36.954
Do you know where Lee is?

1:38:38.173 --> 1:38:40.001
He was at my aunt's house
for a while,

1:38:40.044 --> 1:38:42.438
but my mom
wouldn't leave him alone,

1:38:42.481 --> 1:38:44.657
so he took his tent
and moved out to the lake.

1:38:45.615 --> 1:38:47.008
Which lake?

1:38:47.051 --> 1:38:48.923
Um, Land Between the Lakes.

1:38:48.966 --> 1:38:50.663
It's a state park down 641.

1:38:52.448 --> 1:38:54.189
He comes into town
when he wants to.

1:38:54.885 --> 1:38:55.842
Well, he's just...

1:38:57.018 --> 1:38:58.323
going through something,
I guess.

1:38:59.846 --> 1:39:01.674
But I asked him about you

1:39:01.718 --> 1:39:03.067
and he just said that
you went another way.

1:39:04.286 --> 1:39:06.114
I wondered
why he's been staying.

1:39:06.157 --> 1:39:08.203
I guess he was hoping
that you'd show up, right?

1:39:10.683 --> 1:39:12.163
No, I don't know about that.

1:39:13.512 --> 1:39:15.558
I don't know if he'd actually
even want to see me,

1:39:16.211 --> 1:39:17.690
to be honest.

1:39:17.734 --> 1:39:19.388
I know he was trying
to get back to you, though.

1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:21.956
He said that?

1:39:23.261 --> 1:39:26.003
[chuckles]
God, he's an asshole.

1:39:26.047 --> 1:39:27.831
Why is he even like this,
you know?

1:39:27.874 --> 1:39:29.311
I tell him no one
even remembers

1:39:29.354 --> 1:39:31.791
all that stuff
with the cops anymore.

1:39:31.835 --> 1:39:34.446
It was three stupid days
and they let him go.

1:39:34.490 --> 1:39:35.621
This is about your dad?

1:39:36.796 --> 1:39:37.972
He didn't tell you?

1:39:40.887 --> 1:39:42.454
Our dad's a drunk.

1:39:42.498 --> 1:39:46.023
So drunk that he'd piss
on the wall kinda guy.

1:39:46.067 --> 1:39:47.982
He got in Lee's face
a couple of times

1:39:48.025 --> 1:39:49.548
and Lee would, you know,
try to calm him down,

1:39:49.592 --> 1:39:52.421
and the day he left,
he wound up hitting Lee.

1:39:52.464 --> 1:39:55.293
And when I tried to
break 'em up, he hit me, too.

1:39:57.426 --> 1:39:58.557
Lee just lost it,

1:39:58.601 --> 1:40:00.864
and he told me
to call the cops.

1:40:00.907 --> 1:40:03.649
And when our dad ripped
the phone out of the wall,

1:40:03.693 --> 1:40:06.087
Lee got him in a headlock.
He told me to run into town.

1:40:07.958 --> 1:40:09.655
And when I got back
with the cops,

1:40:09.699 --> 1:40:12.963
Lee was pretty beat up
and Dad's car was gone.

1:40:13.007 --> 1:40:14.225
And Lee told 'em
that he took off,

1:40:14.269 --> 1:40:16.271
but there was blood on Lee,

1:40:16.314 --> 1:40:17.707
so they had to put him
in a holding cell

1:40:17.750 --> 1:40:19.491
so they could test it.

1:40:19.535 --> 1:40:22.538
And for a minute there,
everyone was like,

1:40:22.581 --> 1:40:24.583
"Lee killed him,
Lee killed him."

1:40:24.627 --> 1:40:26.237
But it was all Lee's blood.

1:40:26.281 --> 1:40:28.109
It was all bullshit,
and they had to let him go.

1:40:29.110 --> 1:40:31.068
And that was four years ago,

1:40:31.112 --> 1:40:33.244
and he's been out of town
for three and a half of 'em.

1:40:34.767 --> 1:40:35.812
It's not fair.

1:40:37.466 --> 1:40:38.902
It's not fair.

1:40:38.945 --> 1:40:40.338
[children chattering]

1:40:42.471 --> 1:40:43.472
[Maren] Lee!

1:41:21.118 --> 1:41:22.902
-[fireworks exploding]
-[dog barking]

1:41:22.946 --> 1:41:24.426
-[people exclaiming]
-[Maren] Your tent.

1:41:24.469 --> 1:41:27.081
We should really use it.
Just get lost.

1:41:28.169 --> 1:41:29.170
[Lee] Where do you want to go?

1:41:31.085 --> 1:41:34.262
I don't know. Anywhere.
West. Let's go west.

1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:47.188
[laughs]

1:42:20.090 --> 1:42:21.831
[mechanic]
It's your rod bearings then.

1:42:21.874 --> 1:42:23.920
[Lee] Seriously? Shit!

1:42:23.963 --> 1:42:25.182
That means a new engine.

1:42:25.226 --> 1:42:27.184
I'd rather just sell it
for parts.

1:42:27.228 --> 1:42:29.578
Tell you what,
you make me a good offer,
I'll sell it to you right now.

1:42:29.839 --> 1:42:31.623
[splutters] You don't
want to sell it out here.

1:42:31.667 --> 1:42:33.147
-[Lee] Why?
-Look around, man.

1:42:34.887 --> 1:42:35.888
How you gonna get home?

1:42:37.020 --> 1:42:38.064
I don't know.

1:43:10.445 --> 1:43:11.837
You do go someplace else.

1:43:13.274 --> 1:43:14.405
[Maren] Watching me read?

1:43:14.449 --> 1:43:15.319
[Lee] Yeah.

1:43:18.192 --> 1:43:20.672
[Maren] Well, you should know
after this, I'm out of books.

1:43:20.716 --> 1:43:22.805
I'll have to go
to a bookstore.

1:43:22.848 --> 1:43:24.850
[Lee] May have to stop
on the way back, in Omaha.

1:43:26.287 --> 1:43:27.592
By the way,
those guys were saying

1:43:27.636 --> 1:43:29.855
we should have two days
of water with us

1:43:29.899 --> 1:43:32.118
in case the engine gives out.

1:43:32.162 --> 1:43:33.468
In case we have
to wait on a ride.

1:43:36.035 --> 1:43:38.124
We should get some new wheels
as soon as we can.

1:43:39.735 --> 1:43:41.302
I wish we could save it.

1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:44.130
I'd rather have a van, anyway.

1:43:45.262 --> 1:43:47.133
I learned how to drive
in that truck.

1:43:47.177 --> 1:43:48.613
You learned how to kiss
in that truck.

1:43:50.006 --> 1:43:52.878
I knew how to kiss before you,
Mr. Kentucky.

1:43:52.922 --> 1:43:53.749
Ah.

1:44:02.453 --> 1:44:04.020
I sang to my girl
in that truck.

1:44:26.042 --> 1:44:27.261
Kayla told me about...

1:44:28.697 --> 1:44:29.959
what happened with your dad.

1:44:32.527 --> 1:44:33.832
Kayla doesn't know
what happened.

1:44:35.617 --> 1:44:37.401
He sounds like
he was a fucking asshole.

1:44:37.445 --> 1:44:38.359
[Lee] I don't wanna...

1:44:39.925 --> 1:44:41.144
I don't want to talk
about my dad.

1:44:42.624 --> 1:44:44.582
I don't sweat this stuff out
like you do.

1:44:51.415 --> 1:44:53.809
You know,
Kayla said that he...

1:44:55.332 --> 1:44:57.291
that he hit you both
the day that he left.

1:44:58.204 --> 1:44:59.162
That's true.

1:45:02.818 --> 1:45:04.341
Told her to get the cops.
She did.

1:45:06.387 --> 1:45:07.301
And then he left.

1:45:11.043 --> 1:45:13.655
I don't know, I don't
really believe that. I mean,

1:45:13.698 --> 1:45:16.179
there must've been
a lot of blood on you
for the cops to bring you in.

1:45:16.222 --> 1:45:19.095
If you wanna know, Maren,
he came for me, okay?

1:45:19.138 --> 1:45:20.575
He tried to rip me open
with his teeth.

1:45:25.536 --> 1:45:27.538
That's the first time
I ever smelled it on someone.

1:45:47.253 --> 1:45:48.342
What happened after that?

1:45:52.215 --> 1:45:53.390
[Lee sighs]

1:45:55.871 --> 1:45:56.785
Lee,

1:45:57.873 --> 1:45:59.004
you can tell me.

1:46:03.835 --> 1:46:06.055
[Lee sighs, tuts]

1:46:06.098 --> 1:46:08.187
[exhales heavily] He, uh...

1:46:08.231 --> 1:46:09.232
He passed out.

1:46:11.974 --> 1:46:15.412
I got him in a... I put him
in a fucking... [sniffles]

1:46:15.456 --> 1:46:19.329
headlock, and bashed
an ashtray over his head.

1:46:22.463 --> 1:46:24.639
Dragged his fucking body
to his car.

1:46:25.944 --> 1:46:27.032
Put him in the car,

1:46:28.512 --> 1:46:31.297
and I drove to this barn
about a mile outside town

1:46:31.341 --> 1:46:32.429
that I knew was abandoned.

1:46:36.477 --> 1:46:37.565
[sniffles]

1:46:40.481 --> 1:46:41.917
How long was he in the barn?

1:46:50.142 --> 1:46:51.405
Uh, three days.

1:46:52.536 --> 1:46:53.755
I think, yeah.

1:46:59.978 --> 1:47:01.023
Three days.

1:47:07.595 --> 1:47:09.205
I duct-taped the shit
out of him too.

1:47:09.248 --> 1:47:10.772
Everywhere
except his nostrils,

1:47:10.815 --> 1:47:11.686
so he could breathe.

1:47:16.952 --> 1:47:19.041
And when
I finally came back...

1:47:21.217 --> 1:47:22.479
It's the sound he was making,

1:47:22.523 --> 1:47:24.046
it's the noise
and the breathing.

1:47:27.745 --> 1:47:29.268
He knew what was gonna happen.

1:47:32.837 --> 1:47:34.012
[exhales heavily]

1:47:38.974 --> 1:47:40.062
[Maren sniffles]

1:47:44.632 --> 1:47:45.633
What did you do?

1:47:48.853 --> 1:47:50.464
I ate him right the fuck up.

1:47:52.727 --> 1:47:54.250
And it felt fucking great.

1:47:55.556 --> 1:47:58.950
I felt high as a motherfucker.
[inhales sharply]

1:48:11.876 --> 1:48:12.921
Probably would have
killed myself

1:48:12.964 --> 1:48:13.965
if it weren't for Kayla.

1:48:18.927 --> 1:48:20.058
I feel like I should have,
you know.

1:48:20.102 --> 1:48:22.583
No. No, stop.

1:48:23.540 --> 1:48:25.150
[Lee breathes heavily]

1:48:26.587 --> 1:48:28.023
I would have done
the same thing.

1:48:29.590 --> 1:48:30.634
I would have done
the same thing.

1:48:32.636 --> 1:48:33.376
-Do you mean it?
-I would have done it in my way
but I would have done it.

1:48:37.598 --> 1:48:39.513
You protected the people
that you love.

1:48:45.780 --> 1:48:47.303
You don't think
I'm a bad person?

1:48:54.266 --> 1:48:56.181
All I think is that
I love you.

1:49:00.577 --> 1:49:02.405
[Lee breathes shakily]

1:49:10.108 --> 1:49:11.632
[Lee exhales deeply]

1:49:14.156 --> 1:49:15.461
[Lee sniffles]

1:49:17.028 --> 1:49:18.726
[Lee crying]

1:49:51.672 --> 1:49:53.108
[Maren] Where do we go next?

1:49:54.283 --> 1:49:55.240
[Lee] Anywhere.

1:49:56.241 --> 1:49:57.939
[Maren] Let's drive back.

1:49:57.982 --> 1:49:59.723
Until the truck
gives out somewhere.

1:50:00.985 --> 1:50:03.509
And then just stay.

1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:07.035
We can get a place, jobs.

1:50:07.949 --> 1:50:09.994
You know, like people do.

1:50:10.038 --> 1:50:13.084
[Lee] You wanna be people?
Let's be people.

1:50:13.128 --> 1:50:15.870
[Maren] Yeah.
Let's be them for a while.

1:50:21.919 --> 1:50:23.138
[Lee] Yeah,
we're in Ann Arbor now.

1:50:24.008 --> 1:50:25.270
Ann Arbor.

1:50:25.314 --> 1:50:26.707
Maren got a job
at the university,

1:50:26.750 --> 1:50:29.187
at the bookstore,
so, we're right near campus.

1:50:33.757 --> 1:50:34.715
What'd you say?

1:50:37.326 --> 1:50:38.806
Yeah, maybe if
we're here long enough.

1:50:38.849 --> 1:50:40.024
Hey, Kayla says hi.

1:50:41.025 --> 1:50:42.636
-Hi.
-Maren says hi.

1:50:42.679 --> 1:50:44.463
-She wants to come up.
-Yeah.

1:50:46.161 --> 1:50:47.902
[indistinct chatter]

1:51:21.979 --> 1:51:23.502
[indistinct chatter]

1:51:29.595 --> 1:51:32.207
Lee, I brought your...

1:51:35.166 --> 1:51:36.124
[sighs]

1:52:04.718 --> 1:52:06.023
[breathes deeply]

1:52:10.071 --> 1:52:12.508
-[Maren whimpering]
-[shushing]

1:52:20.995 --> 1:52:22.692
[Sully breathing heavily]

1:52:22.736 --> 1:52:24.955
I'm gonna take my hand away,

1:52:26.217 --> 1:52:27.784
and you're not gonna scream.

1:52:28.785 --> 1:52:30.656
Because Sully's a friend

1:52:31.701 --> 1:52:34.051
and we don't scream
at friends.

1:52:38.099 --> 1:52:39.361
[gasping]

1:52:46.020 --> 1:52:48.674
Where's your...
Where's your cutie-pie?

1:52:48.718 --> 1:52:50.024
[laughing]

1:52:50.807 --> 1:52:52.853
I saw him.

1:52:52.896 --> 1:52:56.770
I saw him walk out of here
half an hour ago.

1:52:58.859 --> 1:52:59.773
I don't know.

1:53:03.385 --> 1:53:05.169
What's all this for, Sully?

1:53:10.044 --> 1:53:11.306
Ever...

1:53:11.349 --> 1:53:14.439
Ever since I drove away
from you,

1:53:15.310 --> 1:53:17.268
up there in Minnesota,

1:53:18.879 --> 1:53:20.489
nothing's felt right.

1:53:23.448 --> 1:53:24.928
[Maren] What does that mean?

1:53:28.497 --> 1:53:29.454
[smacks lips]

1:53:29.890 --> 1:53:31.152
It means...

1:53:35.721 --> 1:53:37.811
[breathes heavily]

1:53:37.854 --> 1:53:38.855
It means...

1:53:41.379 --> 1:53:43.120
It mean... It...

1:53:43.164 --> 1:53:47.255
It means unfinished business.

1:53:53.130 --> 1:53:55.829
Sully, me and Lee...

1:53:59.745 --> 1:54:00.703
we are together now.

1:54:01.312 --> 1:54:02.661
[Maren gasps]

1:54:02.705 --> 1:54:05.186
That's not the business
I'm talkin' about.

1:54:13.759 --> 1:54:15.849
I don't mind.

1:54:15.892 --> 1:54:19.200
I don't... I don't mind
if you don't like Sully.

1:54:21.376 --> 1:54:26.511
What I mind is how much
you know about him

1:54:26.555 --> 1:54:28.600
in that little head of yours.

1:54:30.298 --> 1:54:32.691
You don't think
I'd tell anyone, right?

1:54:32.735 --> 1:54:34.780
[Sully groans]

1:54:34.824 --> 1:54:36.695
I mean, who would believe me?

1:54:36.739 --> 1:54:37.827
[Sully groans]

1:54:40.177 --> 1:54:44.268
And you're the one who told me
you don't kill any...

1:54:45.661 --> 1:54:47.619
You don't kill, right?

1:54:47.663 --> 1:54:48.882
You told me that, Sully.

1:54:48.925 --> 1:54:50.492
You know, I told...

1:54:50.535 --> 1:54:54.322
I used to try and tell people
the truth, you know.

1:54:57.673 --> 1:54:59.544
They never took me serious.

1:55:02.547 --> 1:55:03.722
[Sully sighs]

1:55:08.205 --> 1:55:10.468
I just wanted to be...

1:55:10.512 --> 1:55:13.602
I just wanted to be with
someone who understood.

1:55:14.429 --> 1:55:15.647
Do you know what I mean?

1:55:18.563 --> 1:55:19.477
Do you?

1:55:20.478 --> 1:55:21.392
Mm.

1:55:22.828 --> 1:55:23.829
Mm.

1:55:24.395 --> 1:55:25.919
[sniffling]

1:55:26.876 --> 1:55:27.833
Hmm.

1:55:31.359 --> 1:55:32.447
[Sully grunts softly]

1:55:33.491 --> 1:55:34.753
[door opens quietly]

1:55:42.892 --> 1:55:43.893
[Maren] Hey.

1:55:44.807 --> 1:55:46.765
You never get sick
of yourself?

1:55:54.556 --> 1:55:57.037
Sully just wants
to sleep at night.

1:55:57.863 --> 1:55:58.908
That's all.

1:56:02.172 --> 1:56:03.869
Sully just wants to sleep.

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:06.568
Sleep it off.

1:56:08.004 --> 1:56:09.049
I said,

1:56:09.919 --> 1:56:13.749
stop calling yourself Sully.

1:56:13.792 --> 1:56:14.968
Shh!

1:56:28.764 --> 1:56:30.505
[breathing heavily]

1:56:31.593 --> 1:56:32.986
[screaming]

1:56:35.249 --> 1:56:36.685
[Lee grunting]

1:56:36.728 --> 1:56:38.165
[Sully yells]

1:56:41.777 --> 1:56:43.779
[ALL GRUNTING]

1:56:49.393 --> 1:56:51.787
[SULLY YELLING]

1:56:55.399 --> 1:56:57.140
[GROANS]

1:56:57.184 --> 1:56:58.924
Get off, Maren. Get off.

1:57:00.404 --> 1:57:02.406
-[Maren grunting]
-[Sully groaning]

1:57:09.631 --> 1:57:11.067
[Sully gasps deeply]

1:57:22.296 --> 1:57:23.862
[Maren gasping]

1:57:29.694 --> 1:57:30.956
[Lee grunting]

1:57:35.309 --> 1:57:36.223
[Lee] Careful.

1:57:37.137 --> 1:57:38.007
Come on.

1:57:38.051 --> 1:57:39.704
[panting and grunting]

1:57:44.535 --> 1:57:45.536
[sully groaning weakly]

1:57:51.455 --> 1:57:52.500
Up.

1:58:00.116 --> 1:58:01.683
[Sully groaning]

1:58:04.773 --> 1:58:06.383
[Sully wheezing]

1:58:08.429 --> 1:58:09.995
[panting]

1:58:12.346 --> 1:58:14.783
[screaming in pain]

1:58:17.438 --> 1:58:18.700
[gasping in pain]

1:58:21.485 --> 1:58:23.487
[gasping deeply]

1:58:32.540 --> 1:58:34.194
[Sully stops breathing]

1:58:46.684 --> 1:58:48.469
[panting]

1:58:55.302 --> 1:58:56.520
[panting]

1:59:45.526 --> 1:59:46.962
[continues panting]

1:59:48.703 --> 1:59:49.617
[grunting]

2:00:14.555 --> 2:00:16.992
[Lee] That's the man you met,
the one who followed you?

2:00:17.035 --> 2:00:18.733
I smelled him two blocks
from here.

2:00:18.776 --> 2:00:19.821
How the fuck did he find you?

2:00:21.257 --> 2:00:22.345
[Maren] Oh, no.

2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:26.349
[Lee coughing]

2:00:26.393 --> 2:00:27.481
[Lee gasping]

2:00:37.012 --> 2:00:38.709
[Lee coughing]

2:00:50.417 --> 2:00:51.287
[Maren] Hang on.

2:00:51.331 --> 2:00:52.419
[breathing nervously]

2:01:01.384 --> 2:01:03.647
Look. [whimpers]

2:01:03.691 --> 2:01:05.475
Fuck, he hit your lung.

2:01:05.519 --> 2:01:07.390
We gotta go to the ER.

2:01:07.434 --> 2:01:09.827
Air is coming out of this.
I can see it.

2:01:09.871 --> 2:01:10.741
He got Kayla.

2:01:12.047 --> 2:01:13.527
He got Kayla.

2:01:13.570 --> 2:01:15.311
Don't think about that
right now.

2:01:16.356 --> 2:01:17.966
[Lee] Fuck.

2:01:18.009 --> 2:01:20.795
[Maren] Lee, we can't handle
this by ourselves, and...

2:01:20.838 --> 2:01:22.187
-Am I bad?
-No.

2:01:22.231 --> 2:01:24.712
No, no, Lee.
You're good, all right?

2:01:24.755 --> 2:01:25.756
You're in shock.

2:01:27.541 --> 2:01:29.238
-Am I bad?
-No.

2:01:29.282 --> 2:01:30.718
No.

2:01:30.761 --> 2:01:33.329
We can't call
an ambulance, Lee.

2:01:33.373 --> 2:01:35.157
We can't let anybody in here.

2:01:35.766 --> 2:01:37.028
We're just gonna go.

2:01:37.812 --> 2:01:39.117
Come on.

2:01:39.161 --> 2:01:40.728
-I want you to eat first.
-Come on, Lee.

2:01:41.119 --> 2:01:42.120
Come on.

2:01:42.164 --> 2:01:43.861
-I want you to eat me.
-No.

2:01:43.905 --> 2:01:45.689
-I want you to eat...
-I'm not gonna eat him.

2:01:45.733 --> 2:01:47.430
-No. I want you to eat...
-I don't wanna.

2:01:47.474 --> 2:01:48.649
I want you to eat me.

2:01:48.692 --> 2:01:49.650
I want you to eat.

2:01:49.693 --> 2:01:51.086
-I want you to feed.
-No.

2:01:51.129 --> 2:01:52.783
-I want you to eat.
-No.

2:01:52.827 --> 2:01:54.655
-I don't wanna. I can't. Stop.
-I want you to do it, Maren.

2:01:54.698 --> 2:01:56.134
[Lee] I'm done here.
[Maren] No. No. No.

2:01:56.178 --> 2:01:58.267
-I want you to do it, Maren.
-Lee, stop.

2:01:58.311 --> 2:02:00.356
-No. No, I can't.
-Bones and all.

2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:01.749
-[Maren] I can't. Stop.
-[Lee coughs]

2:02:01.792 --> 2:02:03.054
[Lee] It's beautiful.
[Maren] No. No. Stop.

2:02:03.098 --> 2:02:04.969
Let me up. Let me up.
Let me up.

2:02:05.013 --> 2:02:06.536
[Lee] It's the easiest thing,
Maren, love.

2:02:06.580 --> 2:02:07.624
[Maren] No. No. No.

2:02:07.668 --> 2:02:09.104
[Lee] Just love me and eat.

2:02:12.455 --> 2:02:14.065
[imperceptible]
