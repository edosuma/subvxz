haven't painted

01:17.344 --> 01:18.777

to tell you.

hates anchovies.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.296

to the pet shop!

The lair's not
big enough

02:16.136 --> 02:17.869

and that monkey.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.070

Right, April.
They're releasing

today.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.052
The thief who stole
the famous Galuby Ruby?

02:34.054 --> 02:35.754
That's the guy.
I want you

02:35.756 --> 02:37.155
to get over there
and interview him.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.990
Try to find out
where he hid it.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.825
But if he wouldn't
tell the police,

02:40.827 --> 02:42.561
what makes you think
he'll tell me?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.296
Because you're a woman,

02:44.298 --> 02:47.198
something he hasn't
seen in 15 years.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.302
Hmm. A chance
to scoop April O'Neil
on her own story.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.539
But would I sink
to a slimy trick
like that?

02:54.541 --> 02:56.140
You bet I would.

03:01.947 --> 03:04.316

coming home.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.802

piled up.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.038
Piled up! Awk! Piled up!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.641
Will you shut up,
you birdbrain?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.075
Shut up, birdbrain.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.845
15 years
of your nagging!

03:33.847 --> 03:35.780
If you didn't
belong to Mugsy,

03:35.782 --> 03:37.882
I'd wring your neck!

sorry for Michelangelo

03:54.534 --> 03:56.300

that monkey.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.936
Yeah? Well, I feel

Ooh!

It serves you right

Oh, now, April,
let's talk it over.

Yeah. I can see that.

04:48.386 --> 04:49.887
Goodness!
You certainly

04:49.889 --> 04:51.422
made a mess
of this bird.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.157
How did
this happen?

04:53.159 --> 04:56.695
Uh, I spilled
some paint
on the stupid pest.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.930
Stupid pest! Rawk!
Stupid pest!

04:58.932 --> 05:01.733
No more questions!
Just clean him off!

05:01.735 --> 05:04.635
Uh, y-- All right.
If you insist.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.704
I'll be back
in a half an hour,

05:19.619 --> 05:21.486
This dude just
isn't working out.

I'd like to have
my deposit back.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.558
Uh, sorry.
No cash refunds.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.759
But you can trade him
for another pet.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.351

clean him up?

05:58.592 --> 05:59.757
Here he is.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.825
I even shined up
his beak.

06:01.827 --> 06:04.529

put a muzzle on him.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.297
Hmm. Come to think of it,

06:06.299 --> 06:08.500

the right one.

What's the difference?

if he's changed any.

the Galuby Ruby!

09:02.108 --> 09:04.508
We've gotta find
that parrot, and fast.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.277
If they tear down
this building,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.780
the Galuby Ruby
is a goner!

09:11.183 --> 09:12.083
[tires screeching]

09:14.386 --> 09:17.622
Look, boss. It's the guy
who swiped your parrot.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.756
How do you know?

09:18.758 --> 09:19.990
Well, don't you
remember?

09:19.992 --> 09:22.893
He said the guy
had a green face!

09:22.895 --> 09:24.361
Okay, you
parrot poacher.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.664
Hand over that bird.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.365
Oh? What bird?

09:28.367 --> 09:31.535
Don't play dumb with me,
you big goon.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.205
Big goon, am I?

09:36.241 --> 09:39.210
Uh, "Mean...Green...

09:39.212 --> 09:40.211
[mispronouncing]
"Gian-- Gi--

09:40.213 --> 09:41.212
Giant."

09:41.214 --> 09:43.948
In the flesh,
wimpazoid.

09:45.717 --> 09:48.019
Whoa...ohh!

09:48.021 --> 09:49.387
Ohh!

09:49.389 --> 09:52.623
Now it's your turn,
shorty.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.460
Yeoww!

09:55.462 --> 09:57.528
Whoa!

09:57.530 --> 09:58.796
Oomp! Ooh.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.331
Ahhhh!

10:00.333 --> 10:01.432
[birds tweeting]

10:01.434 --> 10:02.834
Hey, boss, I know

10:02.836 --> 10:04.101
we're looking
for a parrot,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.771
but would one
of these birdies do?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.505
Grrrrr!

10:11.009 --> 10:12.210
Remember, Michelangelo,

10:12.212 --> 10:14.011
one more incident
like that,

10:14.013 --> 10:15.913
and Ditto is
ancient history.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.881
Right. We've got
better things to do

10:17.883 --> 10:19.283
than keep on
fixing the place

10:19.285 --> 10:21.118
after your pets
destroy it.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.388
Chill, dudes. Ditto knows
the house rules.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.290
Don't you,
little fella?
Little fella.
Little fella.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.391
Rawk!

10:27.393 --> 10:29.727
Whoa. What
do we have here?

10:29.729 --> 10:30.628
What is it?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.897
Major discovery!
Look!

10:32.899 --> 10:34.498
It's some kind
of key.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.799
Some kind of key.
Rawk!

10:35.801 --> 10:36.901
I wonder
what it's for.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.871
Hmm. That's a very
unusual shape.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.807
You know, my guess is
it's quite rare.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.242
Let me run it
through my key
analyzer spectroscope

10:45.244 --> 10:46.511
and see
what comes up.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.647
Oh, don't get
your feathers
in an uproar.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.348
Donatello will
give it back.
Give it back.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.450
[whistles]
Give it back.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.752
That's what I've
always dreamed of--

10:54.754 --> 10:57.121
to hear Michelangelo
in stereo.

10:58.423 --> 10:59.857
April O'Neil here.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.426
O'Neil, this is
Mugsy McGuffin.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.129
Do you still want
that interview?
Do I?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.864
<i>Then get over</i>
<i>to my hideout,</i>
<i>pronto.</i>

11:06.866 --> 11:08.900

<i>The third</i>
<i>abandoned warehouse</i>

11:11.537 --> 11:12.870
I'm on my way!

11:16.975 --> 11:18.609
I can't believe it!

11:18.611 --> 11:19.943
I'm getting
the inside story

11:19.945 --> 11:22.447
on the notorious
Mugsy McGuffin!

11:22.449 --> 11:24.949
Going up?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.251
No! Wait!

11:27.253 --> 11:29.520
[ding ding ding]

11:29.522 --> 11:31.455
[chuckles]
I really hate

11:31.457 --> 11:33.490
pulling those nasty
tricks on April.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.625
Not!

11:40.399 --> 11:41.766
[ding]

11:41.768 --> 11:43.567
Oh, that Vernon!

11:44.770 --> 11:46.570
When I get
my hand on him...

11:50.742 --> 11:53.110
All right, Raphael.
Your move.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.813
Remember...
you asked for it.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.947
Eeee...yee...
yahh!

11:56.949 --> 11:57.982
Whoa!

11:57.984 --> 11:59.149
Ow!

11:59.151 --> 12:01.285
Okay. Had enough?

12:01.287 --> 12:04.355
Hey, dudes,
anybody seen my
little birdie bud?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.657
Not since he ate
my spare bandana.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.525
And my arm bands.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.528
Well, I hope he left
room for lunch.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.763
I made him a snail
and earthworm pizza,

12:12.765 --> 12:14.132
hold the birdseed.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.500
Well, there goes
<i>my</i> appetite.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.502
Rawk! Rawk!

12:17.504 --> 12:18.669
Ditto, dude!

12:18.671 --> 12:19.937
[burp] Rawk.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.639
That blasted bird

12:21.641 --> 12:23.440
ate all my stuff!

12:23.442 --> 12:24.675
My joke books.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.244
My Green
Avenger costume.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.014
[gasp] Even
my autographed photo
of Shecky Schtick!

12:30.016 --> 12:31.515
And worst of all,

12:31.517 --> 12:33.350
he's got a big mouth!

12:33.352 --> 12:35.953
Rawk!
Big mouth!
Big mouth!

12:35.955 --> 12:37.120
Ha ha ha ha!
That's it.

12:37.122 --> 12:39.690
I am gonna
baste that bird!

12:39.692 --> 12:41.225
Cool off, Raphael.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.427
Yeah. Besides,
Ditto's right.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.263
You <i> do</i> have
a big mouth.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.930
Take that back,
surfer breath!

12:46.932 --> 12:49.099
Make me,
mondo mouth!

12:49.101 --> 12:50.834
Hey, hold on, guys.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.304
You're acting
like a couple
of teenagers.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.840
Could it be because
we <i> are</i> teenagers?

12:55.842 --> 12:58.109
Michelangelo,
you're just
gonna have to

12:58.111 --> 12:59.443
take the parrot
back.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.811
Hey, what's
going on, guys?

13:00.813 --> 13:02.947
Ditto ate
one little foot locker,

13:02.949 --> 13:05.183
and now he's gotta go
back to the pet shop.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.750
Oh, come on, guys.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.419
What are you getting
so upset about?

13:08.421 --> 13:10.154
He's just
a cute little bird.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.522
Cute little bird.
[whistles]

13:11.524 --> 13:12.689
Cute little bird.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.857
Uh, w--
uh, wait.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.459
Whe-- W-Where
are you going?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.862
Birdie, stay out
of my laboratory!

13:17.864 --> 13:18.829
Oh, no! No!

13:18.831 --> 13:21.031
Watch out
for my experiment!

13:21.033 --> 13:21.666
[crash]

13:23.568 --> 13:25.136
Uh, ow! Ooh!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.503
Ow! Oh! Ow!

13:26.505 --> 13:27.838
Ha ha ha!

13:27.840 --> 13:30.141
Cute little bird.
Cute little bird.

13:33.011 --> 13:36.180
Whee! Hee hee hee
hee hee hee hee!

13:36.182 --> 13:38.916
Aah! Ohh! Uhh!
Oh! Quit it!

13:38.918 --> 13:40.617
Man overboard!
Rawk!

13:40.619 --> 13:42.253
Women and children
first. [whistles]

13:46.291 --> 13:48.693
You know...
the guys are right.

13:48.695 --> 13:53.063
That parrot
is a disaster area
with feathers!

13:53.065 --> 13:55.032
Get him outta here!

13:55.034 --> 13:56.267
[sniffles]

13:56.269 --> 13:58.870
I'm afraid
we're outnumbered,
Ditto, dude.

13:58.872 --> 14:02.139
Looks like it's back
to the pet shop for you.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.675
Good-bye, cruel dudes!

14:06.278 --> 14:08.845
[Ditto]
Cruel dudes!

14:11.683 --> 14:12.917
Here we are--

14:12.919 --> 14:14.551
411 Front Street.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.687
Yoo-hoo!
Mr. Mugsy!

14:17.656 --> 14:19.257
Say
"Cheese it, the cops."

14:19.259 --> 14:21.592
Huh? Who are you?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.294
I'm Vernon Fenwick,
Channel 6 News,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.262
ace investigative
reporter.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.763
Won't you tell
our viewing audience

14:26.765 --> 14:28.532
where you hid
the Galuby Ruby?

14:28.534 --> 14:31.636
An exclusive like that
would do wonders
for my career.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.837
Here's what I think
of your career!

14:33.839 --> 14:34.772
Ha ha ha!

14:34.774 --> 14:36.240
That's a good one, boss.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.209
Really.
That's not very nice.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.244
It figures.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.146
<i>I'm</i> not very nice.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.948
Ha ha! That's
even better!
Ha ha!

14:44.950 --> 14:46.984
Wait a minute!
Aren't you
the same jerk

14:46.986 --> 14:48.252
who tried
to take my picture

14:48.254 --> 14:50.087
when they sprung me
from the prison?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.957
Oh, who, me?
Oh, uh, no.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.859
That-- That-- Oh, that was
a Vernon Fenwick look-alike

14:55.861 --> 14:58.195
who goes around
pretending that he's me.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.897
In that case, I'm
gonna hurt you so bad

15:00.899 --> 15:02.800
that he's sure
to quit doing it.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.235
Boris, do
to this guy's body

15:05.237 --> 15:07.571
what I just did
to his camera.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.907
With the greatest
of pleasure, boss.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.342
Oh! Oh, no!

15:11.344 --> 15:13.243
Please. Please
don't hurt me.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.745
Ohhh! Ohh!

15:14.747 --> 15:15.947
[vehicle
approaching]

15:15.949 --> 15:16.980
I'm warning you!

15:16.982 --> 15:18.649
Lay one finger
on Vernon,

15:18.651 --> 15:20.918
and the entire city
will be an eyewitness!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.287
You heard the lady!
Drop him!

15:23.289 --> 15:24.288
Uhh!

15:24.290 --> 15:25.756
Ouch.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.059
What was I thinkin'?

15:28.061 --> 15:29.826
It must've
been the stress

15:29.828 --> 15:32.029
over the loss
of my Polly.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.231
Now, let's get down
to business, Mugsy.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.933
What did you want
to swee me about?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.636
My parrot.
He flew the coupe.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.238
[sniffles]
I sure miss
that little guy.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.639
Here, Vernon.
Keep shooting.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.108
We're
on a live feed.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.308
You see,

15:45.310 --> 15:47.945
faithful little Polly's
waited all these years

15:47.947 --> 15:49.747
for me to get out of stir,

15:49.749 --> 15:54.418
and now he's gone
and disappeared.
[sniffles]

15:54.420 --> 15:57.220
Oh, you poor
misunderstood person.

15:57.222 --> 16:00.157
Please, everyone...
[sniffling]

16:00.159 --> 16:04.061
keep an eye out
for my cute little Polly.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.764
[loud blowing]

16:06.766 --> 16:08.999
[weeping]
If anyone out there

16:09.001 --> 16:10.835
should see Mugsy's bird,

16:10.837 --> 16:13.037
contact me, April O'Neil,

16:13.039 --> 16:14.238

<i>Here's what</i>

16:15.775 --> 16:18.408
<i>the little dickens</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

16:18.410 --> 16:20.578
I don't believe it.
That's Ditto,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.913
the same bird
Michelangelo
came back with.

16:22.915 --> 16:26.483
Now, what would a crook
like Mugsy McGuffin
want with a parrot?

16:26.485 --> 16:30.154
Maybe that parrot
carries something on it
that he wants.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.355
You mean like fleas?

16:31.357 --> 16:33.958
Uh...no.
Like a key

16:33.960 --> 16:37.061
that might
unlock the mystery
of the Galuby Ruby.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.163
Fellas, we gotta
stop Michelangelo

16:39.165 --> 16:40.864
before he returns that bird!

16:44.936 --> 16:46.470
Big trouble, fellas.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.172
Mugsy McGuffin is after
Michelangelo's parrot.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.241
That key
around its neck
must be conncted

16:51.243 --> 16:53.377
with the Galuby Ruby
he stole.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.145
I got a plan.
You guys

16:55.147 --> 16:58.248
get to that pet shop
before Michelangelo
returns Ditto

16:58.250 --> 17:01.117
while I keep working
on that key analyzer
spectrascope.

17:01.119 --> 17:02.653
Right.
Come on, Raphael.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.186
To the turtle van!

17:06.257 --> 17:07.625
Well, Ditto, dude,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.992
we're almost
at Ralph's Rent A Pet.

17:09.994 --> 17:11.494
I sure don't want
to return you,

17:11.497 --> 17:13.196
but I've got no choice.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.433
No choice.
No choice.
Rawk.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.137
[sniffling]
I'm gonna miss you
like crazy.

17:20.138 --> 17:22.839
Like crazy.
[whistles]
Like crazy.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.942
<i>Please. I beg you.</i>

17:24.944 --> 17:28.412
<i>Help me reunite</i>
<i>with my beloved Polly.</i>

17:28.414 --> 17:29.713

That's you!

17:34.921 --> 17:36.287
Uh-huh.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.322
You belong
to that bad dude?

17:38.324 --> 17:39.757
Bad dude. Bad dude.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.403
Come back, little Ditto!

17:54.806 --> 17:56.974
Here it is--
Ralph's Rent A Pet.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.809
I just hope
we're in time.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.044
[entrance bell rings]
Oh, you fellas

18:01.046 --> 18:04.247
aren't from the, uh,
Save The Turtles
group, are you?

18:04.249 --> 18:05.816
No. We're looking
for a friend of ours

18:05.818 --> 18:07.084
who's returning
a parrot.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.885
Sorry. Haven't seen him.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.155
Uh, thanks.
We'll keep looking.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.024
[panting]

18:15.527 --> 18:17.861
Bering Arms Hotel.
Bering Arms Hotel.

18:17.863 --> 18:18.995
Rawk.
[whistles]

18:18.997 --> 18:20.897
Galuby Ruby.
Galuby Ruby.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.567
The little dude
wants me to follow him.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.168
Chill out,
little dude!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.570
I'll be right up!

18:26.572 --> 18:27.371
[crash]
Rawk!

18:30.075 --> 18:31.308
Okay. now,

18:31.310 --> 18:32.942
what's all
the excitement about?

18:32.944 --> 18:34.744
Galuby Ruby!
Galuby Ruby!

18:34.746 --> 18:37.247
Galuby Ruby?
I have no idea

18:37.249 --> 18:38.949
what you're squawking
about, dude.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.750
What? Oh!

18:39.752 --> 18:43.353
Ohhhhh!

18:43.355 --> 18:44.287
[crash]

18:47.091 --> 18:48.425
Rawk!

18:48.427 --> 18:50.327
Help! [whistles] Help!

18:51.629 --> 18:53.764
<i>April, why are you</i>
<i>wasting your time</i>

18:53.766 --> 18:56.466
<i>on some run-away pet</i>
<i>sob story?</i>

18:56.468 --> 18:59.003
Well, it's got great
human interest, Chief.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.271
Ex-con sobs
for lost parrot.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.372
Pictures at 11.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.408
I definitely
agree with April.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.377
<i>Well, I don't.</i>

19:06.379 --> 19:08.945
<i>Now, get over to the old</i>
<i>Bering Arms Hotel</i>

19:08.947 --> 19:10.647
<i>and cover</i>
<i>the demolition!</i>

19:10.649 --> 19:12.115
Demolition?

19:12.117 --> 19:14.251
<i>They're blowing</i>
<i>the place up</i>
<i>at 4:00.</i>

19:14.253 --> 19:16.353
<i>Explosions. Boom! Pow!</i>

19:16.355 --> 19:18.355
<i>Now, that's what</i>
<i>the public wants to see.</i>

19:18.357 --> 19:19.856
I definitely agree
with you, chief.

19:24.262 --> 19:27.097
Okay. The explosives
are all hooked up.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.531
Then let's clear out.

19:28.533 --> 19:32.069
They're set to go off
in exactly 15 minutes.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.370
[tweet]

19:33.372 --> 19:35.639
Everybody,
clear the area!
Now, move it!

19:39.877 --> 19:42.112
Well, boy genius,
what's the scoop
on that key?

19:42.114 --> 19:44.982
It opens the lock
of a very rare safe

19:44.984 --> 19:46.950
located right here
in this city

19:46.952 --> 19:48.919
at the Bering Arms
Hotel.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.421
Well, that must be
where Mugsy McGuffin
hid the Galuby Ruby!

19:51.423 --> 19:53.123
Mugsy McGuffin!
Rawk!

19:53.125 --> 19:54.792
Galuby Ruby!
Rawk! [whistles]

19:54.794 --> 19:57.328
It's Ditto! He's trying
to tell us something!

19:57.330 --> 19:59.797
Ditto, where's
Michelangelo?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.699
Michelangelo! Rawk!
Bering Arms Hotel!

20:02.701 --> 20:04.734
He must be
in some kind
of trouble!

20:04.736 --> 20:07.304
It looks like Ditto
wants us to follow him.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.506
Didn't I see this once
in a <i> Lassie</i> episode?

20:13.044 --> 20:14.445
Rawk! Rawk!

20:15.746 --> 20:16.880
Rawk!

20:16.882 --> 20:19.616
Gotcha now,
you little
stool pigeon.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.018
Rawk! Rawk!

20:21.020 --> 20:22.785
It's Mugsy McGuffin!

20:22.787 --> 20:24.021
And he's got
Ditto!

20:24.023 --> 20:25.688
Look, it's April!

20:25.690 --> 20:28.825
<i>All you explosion fanatics,</i>
<i>set your VCRs!</i>

20:28.827 --> 20:30.294
<i>In exactly five minutes,</i>

20:30.296 --> 20:33.797
<i>the Bering Arms Hotel</i>
<i>will be blown sky-high!</i>

20:33.799 --> 20:35.932
Bering Arms Hotel...

20:35.934 --> 20:37.568
That's where
Michelangelo is!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.003
Step on it, Boris.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.338
We gotta get to that safe
before it's blown up!

20:43.474 --> 20:44.807
[tires squealing]

20:46.844 --> 20:48.779
[tires squealing]

20:48.781 --> 20:51.682
Okay, now,
hand over that key.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.917
Aha! Got it!

20:53.919 --> 20:55.919
Look! Mugsy's
got the key!

20:55.921 --> 20:57.288
Forget the key,

20:57.290 --> 20:58.822
we gotta rescue
Michelangelo

20:58.824 --> 21:00.491
before this building
blows up!

21:00.493 --> 21:02.592
Which, in true
cliffhanger fashion,

21:02.594 --> 21:04.161
should happen
in exactly...

21:04.163 --> 21:05.429
two minutes.

21:06.697 --> 21:08.265
[Mugsy]
Hey, what are you doing?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.267
Give that back,
you little featherbrain!

21:13.671 --> 21:15.272
[gulps]

21:15.274 --> 21:17.607
Oh, no.
You swallowed it!

21:17.609 --> 21:20.143
Hurry, guys,
this way!

21:22.179 --> 21:23.513
Hold it.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.915
All the floors
have collapsed!

21:24.917 --> 21:26.650
Where's Michelangelo?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.518
Down here, dudes!

21:28.520 --> 21:29.887
How do we
get him out?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.488
The whole place
will go up in...

21:31.490 --> 21:32.656
45 seconds.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.124
And there's
no way down!

21:34.126 --> 21:35.459
Michelangelo,

21:35.461 --> 21:38.261
try tossing
your grappling hook
up to us.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.064
Okay, here goes!
[grunting]

21:44.869 --> 21:46.670
Ugh! Ouch!

21:46.672 --> 21:47.671
It's no use.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.072
He can't reach us.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.374
Rawk! Rawk!

21:54.178 --> 21:55.679
Thanks, Ditto.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.947
Come on, fellas,

21:56.949 --> 21:58.915
this calls for
some Turtle Power!

22:07.658 --> 22:10.393
Oh! Aw, thanks, compadres!

22:10.395 --> 22:11.661
Don't thank us.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.063
Thank Ditto.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.031
Rawk! Rawk!
[whistles]
Rawk!

22:15.033 --> 22:16.499
Yeah, can we skip
the thank-yous

22:16.501 --> 22:18.635
and go straight
to the good-byes?

22:18.637 --> 22:20.938
[Donatello]
That's right.
The explosives!

22:32.049 --> 22:33.450
Oh, no!

22:34.753 --> 22:38.288
[Boris]
Look, Boss, it's red snow!

22:38.290 --> 22:39.956
You idiot!

22:39.958 --> 22:42.359
That was
my Galuby Ruby!

22:42.361 --> 22:43.560
Come along,
Mugsy.

22:43.562 --> 22:46.029
We're gonna throw you
a welcome back party.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.864
I'll bring
the confetti.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.734
[sniffles]
A million dollars worth.

22:51.736 --> 22:54.538
<i>April O'Neil here</i>
<i>at the City Zoo Birdhouse,</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:56.874
