singing and dancing

00:50.110 --> 00:51.310

-Goodness.
-Do you remember the birthday

01:11.830 --> 01:13.270
I had the same idea.

01:13.370 --> 01:14.970
Then we will head to the market

-and find a theatrical troupe.

-Come on.
-What?

01:18.770 --> 01:20.940
In the meantime,
I will arrest Hong Seok-ki.

01:21.810 --> 01:25.050
I have to say, you and the royal inspector
must have been close

-You think so?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.690
Gosh, whatever.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.890
Come on. We should hurry
and find the theatrical troupe.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.690
They must be here
if the party is in two days.

01:34.759 --> 01:37.490
Why? The two of you get along very well.

01:37.830 --> 01:41.060
Oh, was he not the first man to see you
in front of the shrine?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.400
What?

01:42.460 --> 01:45.370
Hold on. Then is he supposed
to take you in as his wife?

01:45.430 --> 01:48.570
No. We decided not to do that.
Do not get the wrong idea.

01:48.870 --> 01:51.640
It is a tremendous stroke of luck to meet
an inspector in front of the shrine.

for a tax shipping freighter

04:42.080 --> 04:44.850

to the station for the time being?

a small amount of the tax grain,

09:58.130 --> 09:59.790

-He was after the ledger too.

about the ledger.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.370
Ledger? The ledger?

11:45.770 --> 11:47.970
That day, I was ordered by the Magistrate

11:48.040 --> 11:51.370
to find the ledger. So I went to
Bo-ri's tavern to look for it and--

11:51.440 --> 11:53.440
-Hey! Shut it!
-Stop it!

12:06.290 --> 12:08.590
And...

12:12.160 --> 12:13.160
And...

12:14.030 --> 12:17.570
And met a lady.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.640
That lady had a build as big as a bear.
Her name was Jang Pat-soon.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.240
She seduced me to her house.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.370
I had to return to the government office,

12:26.440 --> 12:28.910
but she told me to sleep over,
pushed me to the wall,

12:28.980 --> 12:30.640
shoved her lips towards me,

12:30.710 --> 12:34.380
and blew hot air onto my nape.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.620
-This will not do. Ask something else.
-But--

12:37.690 --> 12:39.720
Tell us everything you know!

12:40.820 --> 12:43.190
Everything? Tell you everything I know?

12:43.460 --> 12:46.060
I was born in Gongju,
Chungcheong Province.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.300
When my father turned 20,

12:48.360 --> 12:50.930
he married a daughter
of a government translator

12:51.030 --> 12:52.670
and had a son.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.470
The son was named Mi from Yuseong,
An for face,

12:55.540 --> 12:58.670
and Hae for sorry.
And that son is me, Mi An-hae.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.140
-We told him to tell us everything
-My mother named me

13:01.210 --> 13:03.040
-so he is really telling us everything.
-Mi An-hae

13:03.110 --> 13:04.510
-Make him stop for a minute.
-because when she had me,

13:04.580 --> 13:06.480
-Stop!
-she dreamed of a plate

13:06.550 --> 13:09.150
with a bar of rice cake
and two rice ball cakes.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.190
-I told you to stop!
-The rice cake bar was in the middle

13:11.250 --> 13:12.820
-Why is he not stopping?
-and the rice balls were on each side.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.990
-I do not know how to stop it yet.
-That is when she realized

13:15.060 --> 13:17.430
-Does that mean he cannot stop?
-she will have a son.

13:17.490 --> 13:20.260
And so she gave birth to me...

13:22.260 --> 13:25.630

with a lady for the first time.

13:32.740 --> 13:36.340
said "Mi An-hae"
with a serious face one day,

I was not sure
if she was apologizing to me

13:40.580 --> 13:42.280
or calling out my name.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.760

14:06.670 --> 14:09.610
If we do not go and put things in order,
they will really get out of hand.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.910
Just let them be.

14:11.510 --> 14:14.520
It is all thanks to them, we will be able
to sneak into the hideout.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.450
You should understand them
and be considerate.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.720
Always going on about being considerate.
Did no one put him first in anything?

14:21.060 --> 14:23.590
If we think about others day and night,

14:23.660 --> 14:25.830
we might end up sleeping on the streets.

14:26.230 --> 14:28.030
You worry too much.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.830
Something like that will never happen.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.170
But, my lord,

14:31.230 --> 14:34.200
is sneaking into the hideout ourselves
the only way to solve this case?

14:34.270 --> 14:36.640
I heard it is a very violent place.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.870
It is a place we must go to
at least once to find evidence.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.040
But all those men know our faces.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.110
-Is that okay?
-That is why we will sneak in

14:44.180 --> 14:46.280
by disguising ourselves as members
of the theatrical troupe.

14:46.610 --> 14:49.780
If you are that worried,
why not put some makeup on?

14:50.250 --> 14:51.320
No way.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.390
Let us say we fool the gatekeeper
and make it in.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.760
What next?

14:55.820 --> 14:57.630
We do not even have soldiers.
All we have are those actors.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.490
That is exactly what I mean.
Think again, my lord. Please.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.600
If we get caught--

15:03.660 --> 15:06.100
So one of you must make a trip

15:06.430 --> 15:07.900
to Hoehyeon-dong.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.970
Is the Crown Prince's private house
not in Hoehyeon-dong?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.840
Are you telling us
you want to bring those people here?

15:17.010 --> 15:18.150
-I see.
-I see.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.380
Then I will go as I am swift-footed.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.620
I am much faster than you. I will go.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.490
-I am much faster.
-No, I am!

15:24.550 --> 15:26.920
I am older, so it is obvious I am faster.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.590
My lord. My lord!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.300
I am going on the trip,
so let me see what is going on outside.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.800
Gosh. Seriously!

15:39.030 --> 15:40.100
Goodness.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.310
So you do not have a room to sleep in?

15:44.370 --> 15:47.340
The theatrical troupe took all the rooms.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.180
So there are no rooms for us.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.050
Dozens of their men
are sprawled out everywhere,

15:53.250 --> 15:54.520
so there is no room for us.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.820
What do you mean?

15:58.050 --> 15:59.620
I am sorry, my lord.

15:59.820 --> 16:02.320
I knew this would happen
when you wanted us to put others first.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.030
Then we have no choice
but to let the ladies have this room

16:08.100 --> 16:10.000
-and we will--
-No!

16:11.130 --> 16:14.400
Are you telling us to sleep in the yard?

16:14.770 --> 16:16.440
I cannot do that.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.270
You can do as you please, my lord.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.010
But I am going to sleep in that room.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.640
So you can sleep in the yard
if you want to.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.050
What I was going to say was,
"Let the ladies have this room"

16:27.650 --> 16:30.020
"and we will sleep in the tavern."

16:30.880 --> 16:32.050
Forget it then.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.560
I was thinking of buying you two
some rice wine while we are at the tavern.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.020
Rice wine? Wait!

16:37.090 --> 16:39.860
How about together with the boiled pork
we missed out on last time?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.660
It is no use.

16:43.330 --> 16:46.000
We already visited the tavern,
but it was for nothing.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.070
The government is making
an announcement soon,

16:48.140 --> 16:50.570
so all the taverns were full.
There were no empty rooms.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.840
What will you do now?

16:57.380 --> 17:00.610
Why not consider this room
a large shared room at a tavern

17:00.710 --> 17:02.920
and just sleep together inside?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.950
Nobles might think it improper,

17:07.020 --> 17:09.720
but it is common amongst people like us.

17:13.089 --> 17:16.400
I apologize if I have offended you.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.030
I was worried you might go out
in search of a room to no avail.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.569
Though our lord is slightly,

17:22.640 --> 17:24.940
ever so slightly picky,

17:25.339 --> 17:27.880
he accepts anything if it is reasonable.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.910
He is like the saint

17:29.980 --> 17:32.250
and the noblest
of all the noblemen out there.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.950
Am I not right, my lord?

17:41.720 --> 17:42.760
Fine.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.930
Let us do that.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.900
If everyone sleeps like that,

17:48.700 --> 17:50.130
why not me?

17:53.930 --> 17:55.470
Let us go in.

17:56.570 --> 17:57.640
Thanks.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.510
That reminds me,

18:02.410 --> 18:04.550
do you not have someplace to be, Yuk-chil?

18:05.410 --> 18:06.410
Right.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.620
Look. You should go.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.550
You are much faster than me.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.250
Hurry up.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.760
Have a safe trip.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.330
What are you doing? Go up.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.760
Thank you, Goo-pal.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.670
[Then I will go get some bedside water.]

18:35.410 --> 18:38.810
The room is too small, so we have
no choice but to sleep side-by-side.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.750
So you should sleep next to the wall.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.000
Thank you.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.680
Turn the lights off and lie down.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.050
Tomorrow will be much busier than today.

19:22.490 --> 19:25.330
You can go to sleep first.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.130
I am going to get some fresh air.

19:27.190 --> 19:28.160
So--

19:39.240 --> 19:41.780
What are you doing?

19:49.150 --> 19:50.350
Do not worry.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.820
I will not go over these shelves.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.170
My lord.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.670
My lord, are you asleep?

20:56.480 --> 20:57.550
My lord.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.120
My lord?

21:03.020 --> 21:04.060
My lord.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.260
My lord, are you asleep?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.840
Unbelievable.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.580
What on earth?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.980
Until when will you be in bed?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.650
The sun is high up in the sky.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.650
Change into these and join us.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.370
Good.

23:25.430 --> 23:26.970
That is how you do it.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.180
Goo-pal, not bad.

23:40.550 --> 23:43.580
How you jump around
proves that you are a shaman.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.850
If only you had more frequent visions.

23:46.450 --> 23:47.550
Gwang-soon.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.720
There.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.360
Did you see how high it went?

23:53.160 --> 23:55.100
There are 29 members in the troupe.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.270
Minus the children, that's 27.
Three of each color gets me 81.

23:58.330 --> 24:01.800
If I consider us five including me,
there should be 96.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.700
Why am I missing one?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.110
Oh, there it is.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.280
Including you?

24:09.810 --> 24:11.850
Why would you put yourself in danger?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.880
Because no one
knows Cha Mal-jong like I do.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.520
I will be of help to you.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.850
This is not about knowing how to read
or being good with numbers.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.720
There could be bloodshed.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.060
You will stay behind.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.790
Why would I when this is the best chance

24:25.860 --> 24:27.130
to take down that scumbag?

24:27.430 --> 24:28.730
If that were the case,

24:28.800 --> 24:31.730
I would not have gotten off the boat
after seeing the ledger.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.000
You cannot.

24:33.630 --> 24:34.900
Get this out of my face!

24:35.440 --> 24:36.470
Darn it.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.220
That startled me!

24:48.520 --> 24:51.950
When did you get here, birthday boy?

24:52.090 --> 24:54.090
How are preparations
for your party coming along?

24:54.150 --> 24:56.320
-Where is Tae-seo?
-Tae-seo?

24:56.490 --> 24:59.430
He's probably
out there somewhere training.

25:00.690 --> 25:02.160
Here he is now.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.770
Hong Seok-ki has been captured.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.340
The secret royal inspector
arrested Hong Seok-ki too?

25:12.710 --> 25:15.210
But he will start babbling in no time.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.410
Hold on.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.650
How is the inspector aware
of his involvement?

25:20.910 --> 25:24.220
It must mean that
the ledger has been found.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.950
How did the inspector manage to find it

25:27.020 --> 25:29.060
when the search at Gyehwa Valley
came up empty?

25:29.290 --> 25:31.220
The girl from Gyehwa Valley
must have had it.

25:33.690 --> 25:37.330
I should have killed them all
when I had the chance.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.530
Hold on a second.
If Hong Seok-ki has been caught,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.700
then this place can no longer be safe.

26:03.790 --> 26:04.890
Here we go.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.030
Let me.

26:14.370 --> 26:17.340
It is not easy to fasten these by oneself.

26:19.970 --> 26:22.010
How can you not do this by yourself?

26:22.980 --> 26:24.110
-Well--
-What...

26:25.150 --> 26:26.310
Unbelievable.

26:32.820 --> 26:36.120
First, this sash goes like so.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.790
From your right shoulder

26:38.390 --> 26:40.260
and to the left side of your waist.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.030
This is where the knot is tied.

26:43.630 --> 26:47.670
The next one goes across
your left shoulder

26:49.070 --> 26:50.800
to the right side of your waist.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.670
The two sashes make an X

26:52.770 --> 26:55.510
and they are tied together at waist-level.

27:00.550 --> 27:01.680
Lastly,

27:03.250 --> 27:04.280
this sash...

27:06.320 --> 27:07.390
Like so.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.220
It goes around the waist

27:09.520 --> 27:12.260
and is tied at the center of your back.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.760
The rest is left to drape down.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.770
How can one not do this alone?

27:28.880 --> 27:30.380
Let me help you with yours.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.220
That is not necessary. I can do it myself.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.400
When did you learn how to tie these?

27:53.100 --> 27:55.970
Commoners like us
participate in durepungjang in spring

27:56.040 --> 27:59.710
where we wear sashes and dance
to wish for a good year of harvest.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.270
I learned by observing.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.210
So you belittled me

28:08.380 --> 28:10.420
with knowledge
you only obtained through observing.

28:15.090 --> 28:18.990
Even if I want to participate,
women are not allowed to.

28:19.090 --> 28:21.700
Only men can wish
for a year of good harvest.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.300
That is what you call being ignored.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.410
It is for that reason
I must join as a member of the troupe.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.840
Do not consider leaving me behind
because I am a woman.

28:36.780 --> 28:37.940
In that case,

28:42.950 --> 28:44.420
do not get injured.

28:46.650 --> 28:47.750
That is an order.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.530
Thank you, my lord.

29:05.970 --> 29:10.180
[Gapbigocha: Ganghwa Island's old name]

29:06.010 --> 29:07.910
What about the silver
being shipped to Ganghwa Island?

29:08.140 --> 29:10.440
The mining is nearly complete,
but it will not be done by today.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.410
Once the party is over,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.510
I will head to Ganghwa Island
with the promised silver.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.010
Personally?

29:15.220 --> 29:16.520
But Han-ki is at Gokdu Guild.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.250
No, I will personally see to it
that the gunpowder is traded.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.520
The plans will be shifted up.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.090
Sure. What good will it do
to drag this along?

29:23.190 --> 29:24.790
Getting it over with is also a good idea.

29:24.990 --> 29:27.730
Han-ki will be thrilled if you go instead.

29:27.990 --> 29:30.730
No, maybe she would like to see
Maeng-soo instead.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.130
Actually, no.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.270
It is me she would prefer.

29:34.330 --> 29:36.440
Must you move up your plans though?

29:36.770 --> 29:38.910
-Push has come to shove--
-So we will retreat.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.340
Consider this.

29:41.670 --> 29:45.110
The silver we can collect from here
is enough to give us all an affluent life.

29:46.450 --> 29:49.050
We did not start this
to provide a good life for just us.

29:49.850 --> 29:50.880
Contact Gokdu Guild.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.650
Say I will bring the goods myself.

29:53.190 --> 29:54.190
All right.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.730
You want me to wear this?

30:02.730 --> 30:04.830
Yes, you should.

30:05.030 --> 30:06.500
It suits you well.

30:06.830 --> 30:10.170
Nothing beats this role
if you wish to disguise yourself.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.610
My gosh. Here comes the nobleman!

30:14.610 --> 30:17.340
My, it suits her very well.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.110
It looks great on you.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.620
Every nobleman has a beard.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.020
-You need a beard.
-Right.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.990
There. Great.

30:28.050 --> 30:31.320
My lord, get dressed quickly.

30:31.390 --> 30:34.690
Now, put this on your head.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.330
How lovely. You look great.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.570
Look. This is how you walk.

30:40.030 --> 30:43.240
Twist your knees left and right like this
and go forward.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.810
Like this?

30:46.840 --> 30:50.110
Nobleman, come here
and try out your walk now.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.780
Oh, it is not my turn.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.320
Give it a go.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.860
Nobleman, watch me carefully.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.090
With your fan spread out in one hand,

31:06.160 --> 31:07.290
stretch out your legs like this.

31:07.360 --> 31:11.300
Clear your throat first and say,
"Come forth!"

31:13.730 --> 31:15.970
Come forth!

31:18.070 --> 31:19.740
-Well done.
-Thank you.

31:19.810 --> 31:21.540
-You can sit down.
-Okay.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.610
My lord, come over here.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.750
All right.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.450
Please do better this time.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.020
Like this. Move your arms like this.

31:35.090 --> 31:37.360
Like this.

31:37.920 --> 31:41.230
And like this...

31:41.590 --> 31:43.200
This will not do.

31:46.230 --> 31:47.230
Oh, boy.

31:48.870 --> 31:50.970
This is all you have to do.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.370
Is it that hard?

31:53.040 --> 31:55.280
Do you expect a true nobleman to do this?

31:56.740 --> 31:58.380
This is not working.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.910
How about you each just wear a mask
and go in with us?

32:02.220 --> 32:03.280
Okay.

32:04.450 --> 32:05.820
That would be much better.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.260
Are you sure it will be okay?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.690
Of course. You have seen what I can do.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.300
A ship from Ganghwa Island
will come in later today.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.530
I will wait here until the evening
and go to the market.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.730
For my own peace of mind,

32:19.800 --> 32:22.800
I want to ask the peddlers from the Island
if the kids arrived safely.

32:23.170 --> 32:25.970
Okay, I know. But you must be careful.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.470
I told you. I will be fine.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.010
You need not worry.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.350
The soldiers will arrive soon.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.520
-We are counting on you.
-Sure thing.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.690
[Agriculture is the country's foundation.]

33:00.540 --> 33:01.610
Come along.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.640
Let us go!

33:33.740 --> 33:37.340
Why bother submitting petitions
that keep getting denied?

33:39.780 --> 33:41.910
If you special counselors have
that much time on your hands,

33:41.980 --> 33:43.750
I suggest you go help out in the kitchens.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.990
We have received a very important petition

33:46.050 --> 33:48.550
on Chungcheong Province's
chief clerk of marine transportation.

33:51.120 --> 33:55.500
The royal inspectors' reports
have been arriving one by one.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.670
I was going to suggest to His Majesty

33:58.730 --> 34:01.530
that we conduct an inspection
of the tax grain storage facilities.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.980
That is a very important matter.
Let me take that.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.440
I will pass it to His Majesty.

34:10.510 --> 34:12.750
I plan to consult the Inspector-General
and the Censor-General

34:12.810 --> 34:14.909
so that the Three Offices
can submit a joint petition.

34:16.150 --> 34:17.550
That way, it will not be rejected.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.620
At the Office of Special Counselors,
it is our job to study public opinion.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.560
Even if we are threatened at knifepoint,

34:24.659 --> 34:27.790
we must speak the truth
and do what is right for our country

34:28.900 --> 34:30.730
for that is our honor.

34:33.870 --> 34:35.469
And...

34:37.699 --> 34:40.909
Well, we do have
too much time on our hands.

34:59.990 --> 35:04.100
My gosh! How have you been, sir?

35:04.330 --> 35:05.770
-You made it.
-Yes, hello.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.700
I see that
you brought some new people this year.

35:07.770 --> 35:11.800
I figured it would be boring
to see the exact same thing each year.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.840
So this year,
I brought a percussion ensemble

35:13.910 --> 35:16.140
and even a team of masked actors.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.950
We prepared an incredibly fun show.

35:19.010 --> 35:21.080
I guarantee that it will not let you down.

35:21.150 --> 35:22.180
Is that so?

36:06.190 --> 36:07.560
This is nicely made.

36:07.630 --> 36:09.030
Give me one before you leave.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.430
Of course! Sure thing.

36:12.030 --> 36:14.070
-Let them in!
-Thank you.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.970
All right, come along!

36:24.740 --> 36:26.750
That was much easier than we thought.
Right, Goo-pal?

36:26.810 --> 36:27.880
Yes, totally.

36:27.950 --> 36:31.020
They said the security was very tight,
but it was not too bad.

36:32.050 --> 36:35.050
But it is too quiet here.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.460
Yes, I agree.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.190
Goodness.

36:43.130 --> 36:44.600
What is this now?

37:00.310 --> 37:01.350
Oh, boy.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.580
Let me see.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.660
[I just think it will be fun.
That is all.]

37:49.230 --> 37:52.570
But how will you catch the darn inspector?

37:52.670 --> 37:54.470
He is unbelievably sneaky and persistent.

37:54.530 --> 37:56.700
It will be hard to catch him
unless he comes here.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.570
He would not dare come here.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.370
Right, that is true.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.810
It would be a lot easier

38:01.870 --> 38:04.140
to infiltrate the Celestial Palace.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.610
It can be done, once a year.

38:11.180 --> 38:12.290
Just that one day.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.960
Right!

38:20.660 --> 38:21.860
My gosh.

38:22.090 --> 38:26.470
Maeng-soo, it looks like we should throw
a big birthday party for you this year.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.510
[I should have Pebble tail them.]

38:49.390 --> 38:51.360
Even a royal inspector
who passed the civil service exam

38:52.830 --> 38:54.990
does not always make the right decision.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.730
The civil service exam
is such a stupid idea to begin with.

38:57.930 --> 39:00.270
Tae-seo, it is an exam
that such a smart man like you

39:00.330 --> 39:02.840
is not even allowed to take.
It is pure lunacy.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.600
But you see,

39:05.710 --> 39:08.640
life is fair after all.

39:12.210 --> 39:15.210
Even a ten-year-old child knows
how precious a life is.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.550
You abused innocent children
and sold them for profit.

39:19.050 --> 39:20.650
You have no right to speak of fairness.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.290
One more thing.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.900
You think anyone can pass
the civil service exam?

39:33.530 --> 39:34.600
Well...

39:35.840 --> 39:36.970
I do not think so.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.440
Attack!

39:52.450 --> 39:53.750
Who are all these people?

39:53.890 --> 39:55.120
The crown prince's bodyguards?

39:55.790 --> 39:56.860
What do you mean?

39:57.090 --> 39:58.490
If they really are the prince's guards--

39:58.560 --> 40:00.360
We are doomed.

40:00.430 --> 40:02.960
Those guys are known as
the human weapons of Joseon.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.930
I will take care of this place,
so go find the ledger.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.100
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

40:10.170 --> 40:11.500
Over there!

40:20.010 --> 40:21.050
Wait!

40:21.610 --> 40:23.250
Hey!

40:23.850 --> 40:26.550
Why is a woman so strong?

40:26.620 --> 40:28.120
So men can be proud of their strength

40:28.320 --> 40:30.390
while women should be ashamed of it.
Is that what you mean?

40:30.520 --> 40:31.620
Stop!

40:33.530 --> 40:34.890
This seems like the place.

40:35.730 --> 40:36.760
-The ledger.
-The ledger.

40:36.830 --> 40:39.700
Cha Mal-jong could have left it
someplace visible.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.070
Look for it.

40:42.070 --> 40:45.340
Not somewhere organized,
but someplace visible.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.610
Like it is not something valuable.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.420
Why are you in my way?

41:02.090 --> 41:04.690
You should not get distracted and focus!

41:05.690 --> 41:06.760
Come here.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.330
I get it, so stay behind me.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.570
Do not back off!

41:21.470 --> 41:23.480
Goodness, Do-soo!

41:23.540 --> 41:25.980
So you are back! Are you all right?

41:27.080 --> 41:28.180
Yes, I am.

41:28.810 --> 41:32.420
We are continuously getting reports
from the inspectors I told him to kill.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.860
I cannot believe they are still alive!
What is Tae-seo doing?

41:35.990 --> 41:39.330
I told you Tae-seo should not be trusted
with anything.

41:39.390 --> 41:40.890
The chief clerk of marine transportation.

41:41.190 --> 41:43.430
We must get rid of him first.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.400
Do-soo!

41:48.330 --> 41:51.300
You must visit him once more.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.710
Go and press him one more time.

41:54.770 --> 41:57.240
If those spiteful Three Offices
decide to unite against us,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.880
the Office of Inspector-General will
barge in to conduct a house investigation.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.650
Dad, I just came back
from Chungcheong Province.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.680
Leave right this instant.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.330
Tell him to get rid of the chief clerk
of marine transportation first.

42:13.890 --> 42:14.960
Here.

42:15.830 --> 42:18.600
Only pass along
what I told you to Tae-seo.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.030
Do not get involved yourself.
Do you understand?

42:21.570 --> 42:23.900
-Come on.
-Not this one. That one.

42:23.970 --> 42:26.470
All right. Now, here.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.740
Quickly get the horse ready!

42:49.430 --> 42:51.530
But I just got home!

42:51.600 --> 42:53.030
We are in a hurry!

42:56.500 --> 42:59.270
Come here. Eat some delicious food
on your way. All right?

42:59.340 --> 43:01.710
All right, all right.

43:03.340 --> 43:05.010
-Seriously.
-Done.

43:05.110 --> 43:07.580
I will tell him to kill the chief clerk
of marine transportation first.

43:09.110 --> 43:10.120
By the way, Dad.

43:10.180 --> 43:11.720
What is it?

43:13.520 --> 43:14.720
Do you need more money?

43:16.390 --> 43:20.330
In return, may I take a tour
of Tae-seo's hideout?

43:20.830 --> 43:21.960
His hideout?

43:22.900 --> 43:25.260
Do you mean that place
somewhere inside the mountain

43:25.330 --> 43:27.030
where Tae-seo's bums are staying?

43:27.600 --> 43:28.670
Why?

43:28.970 --> 43:30.100
You know,

43:30.840 --> 43:32.500
I have always been curious.

43:33.370 --> 43:36.940
Curious how Tae-seo can spend
money so liberally.

43:38.180 --> 43:41.210
All that wine, those banquets,
and the fine clothes and dining.

43:41.750 --> 43:42.980
How can he afford all that?

43:43.050 --> 43:44.780
That is because the grain paid as tax...

43:49.090 --> 43:53.090
Do not tell me you figured out
how Tae-seo is earning his black money.

43:54.260 --> 43:56.700
No, but I think I will this time.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.270
Here you go.

44:03.500 --> 44:06.610
Then whatever I find
in his hideout is mine.

44:07.310 --> 44:08.440
All right?

44:09.170 --> 44:10.480
-I will be off.
-All right.

44:10.540 --> 44:11.940
Be careful!

44:32.900 --> 44:34.130
You jerks!

44:50.350 --> 44:51.420
What will you do?

44:51.480 --> 44:52.890
They are going to destroy this place.

44:52.950 --> 44:55.150
Go pack up the tax ledgers and leave.

Right, the ledger! I will do so.

45:07.930 --> 45:09.940

46:23.880 --> 46:27.050
If you go after them now,
there is a high risk

46:27.380 --> 46:28.980
they might ambush you in the mountains.

-Yes, my lord.

There were men like that in Joseon?

47:54.500 --> 47:55.930
They are the crown prince's bodyguards.

47:56.070 --> 47:59.740
That means they are the guards from
the palace who protect the crown prince.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.370
No wonder they are so impressive.

the royal family are not only excellent

in martial arts but also beautiful.

-My gosh, not just in martial arts.
-Right?

and dignified eyes!

48:16.120 --> 48:17.160
You are right.

48:17.220 --> 48:19.060
You saw them fight earlier,
did you not? Maybe not.

If this is not a set of rafters,
what can it possibly be?

This is all I have. The rest is with them.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.070
I must get them
or my father will be in trouble.

49:39.140 --> 49:40.440
It is too late for that.

49:40.870 --> 49:42.980
Luckily, I was able to get
the distribution receipt ledger

49:43.040 --> 49:45.680
containing your father's name,
so do not worry.

49:43.440 --> 49:45.940
[Baedang jeungseo:
a document that proves transfer of money]

49:47.250 --> 49:49.280
Head to Gokdu Guild
and postpone the gunpowder deal.

49:49.780 --> 49:50.950
All right.

49:52.950 --> 49:54.650
Come on. We must keep moving for now.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.630
All right, let me see.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.030
Step aside.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.750
This is my territory.

50:39.700 --> 50:40.800
Good.

50:42.270 --> 50:44.470
I see we have fresh produce.

50:44.970 --> 50:46.740
Should I submerge the meat in water first?

50:47.070 --> 50:48.470
Only after you cut off the tail.

50:48.540 --> 50:50.480
Remember not to cut off too much.

50:50.540 --> 50:51.710
Yes, chef.

50:54.380 --> 50:56.180
What on earth are you doing?

50:56.650 --> 50:57.720
-Chicken soup.
-I see.

50:58.350 --> 51:01.220
What? That is not what I meant.

51:01.420 --> 51:04.020
What I want to know is why you are here.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.560
To cook, of course.

51:09.030 --> 51:11.730
So tell me. This must be
your first time coming across

51:11.800 --> 51:13.630
a perfect man who is not only handsome

51:13.700 --> 51:15.130
but can also cook.

51:15.370 --> 51:16.600
Goodness.

51:21.170 --> 51:24.810
Jobs that require strength
should be reserved for men.

51:30.820 --> 51:32.150
Are you out of your mind?

51:32.520 --> 51:34.950
Why did you crush those
when we need them whole?

51:39.360 --> 51:41.790
I guess it makes sense.
A man as old as you

51:41.860 --> 51:44.700
should know how to cook
since you are without a wife.

51:44.930 --> 51:46.030
That is not...

51:46.100 --> 51:48.000
I thank you in advance then.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.940
Please tell me
that it will at least be edible.

51:51.340 --> 51:53.410
Our master may have a short temper,

51:53.470 --> 51:55.370
but he is a gifted scholar and cook.

51:55.510 --> 51:57.240
-That is true.
-I see.

51:57.310 --> 51:58.740
I am glad he is good at something.

51:59.410 --> 52:02.310
We will head outside
and help with other chores then.

52:02.910 --> 52:05.980
-Do good work, everybody!
-Jo-yi, we should...

52:06.220 --> 52:07.650
We will leave them to it.

52:16.530 --> 52:17.700
Old...

52:19.600 --> 52:22.470
and short-tempered, you say?

52:22.530 --> 52:23.940
-Yes, my lord!
-Of course.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.470
I was not asking you.

52:28.540 --> 52:29.810
-Yes, my lord!
-Of course.

52:32.380 --> 52:33.710
Why you...

52:40.090 --> 52:41.090
It is true.

52:47.530 --> 52:48.590
Darn it.

52:58.900 --> 52:59.940
Hush!

53:00.640 --> 53:02.040
You must still not know your place

53:02.140 --> 53:03.910
to think of a way out of here.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.010
I see everything, you know.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.810
I see everything.

53:13.020 --> 53:15.320
Move even an inch and I will make you pay.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.950
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

53:49.490 --> 53:50.890
-Be careful with this.
-Yes, my lord.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.360
-Food is served.
-Can we get some?

53:53.430 --> 53:54.830
-Just a second.
-Coming!

53:54.890 --> 53:56.290
Your food is served.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.570
I will get you yours right away.

54:00.630 --> 54:01.700
Here you go.

54:01.770 --> 54:04.070
You have waited long enough. Here you go.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.370
No, the pleasure is ours.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.640
My lord, this is the last batch.

54:08.910 --> 54:11.540
I see. Sit down and enjoy.

54:11.610 --> 54:12.640
Yes, my lord.

54:14.810 --> 54:16.210
-Shall we?
-Yes, my lord.

54:21.150 --> 54:22.890
-Over here. Before it gets cold.
-Come on.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.370
My goodness.
The meat could not be juicier.

54:36.430 --> 54:38.940
Who knew he could make
such delicious chicken soup?

54:39.940 --> 54:42.940
The broth that has been boiled down
will restore your energy.

54:43.010 --> 54:44.810
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.750
Enjoy your meal.

54:47.810 --> 54:49.850
-Thank you, my lord.
-Thank you, my lord.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.250
-This is the best.
-Is this not delicious?

54:52.320 --> 54:53.990
How succulent.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.690
-You should eat too.
-No, that is not necessary.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.190
Is Jo-yi eating as well?

54:59.590 --> 55:01.030
Where could she have gone?

55:03.860 --> 55:06.130
-Yuk-chil.
-Yes, please enjoy.

55:09.330 --> 55:10.340
Yuk-chil.

55:26.550 --> 55:27.720
Thank you, my lord.

55:28.850 --> 55:29.850
Here you go.

55:30.490 --> 55:33.460
-Darn, that is hot.
-Are you all right?

55:33.830 --> 55:36.460
Of course not. It...

55:36.860 --> 55:40.100
is not hot at all.

55:40.230 --> 55:41.970
Here. Have some.

55:42.030 --> 55:43.200
That must have been hot.

55:46.570 --> 55:49.210
Goo-pal, pace yourself.
You do not want indigestion.

55:49.270 --> 55:51.210
Let go of me!

55:54.550 --> 55:57.050
There is only one drumstick
to share among us,

55:57.350 --> 55:58.880
so how could I possibly eat it?

55:59.650 --> 56:01.220
This is more than enough for me.

56:06.220 --> 56:08.660
Darn these mountain mosquitoes.

56:09.430 --> 56:10.630
Enjoy the drumstick.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.910
My lord.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.940
Have you eaten already?

56:32.820 --> 56:34.520
Goodness, this looks divine!

56:36.990 --> 56:39.690
This was specially seasoned
with sesame oil and mild soy sauce--

56:39.760 --> 56:41.790
Goodness, it is seasoned well.

56:45.830 --> 56:48.300
She is one wild eater.

56:51.870 --> 56:54.770
I have never seen so much meat
on my plate before.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.160
What are these?

57:19.830 --> 57:20.900
Taffy.

57:32.310 --> 57:33.340
Taffy?

58:21.730 --> 58:23.290
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

58:35.210 --> 58:37.640
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

58:38.410 --> 58:40.010
[His Royal Highness made me swear]

58:40.080 --> 58:41.350
[that I protect you.]

58:41.450 --> 58:43.050
[I must locate the entrance
to Baekgwiryeong.]

58:43.110 --> 58:45.520
[Absolutely not.
You cannot go by yourself!]

58:45.580 --> 58:47.320
[One may think you are his wife.]

58:47.590 --> 58:50.220
[They colluded with the officials
in every shady way possible.]

58:50.290 --> 58:51.820
[What is up there?]

58:51.890 --> 58:54.390
[I heard there is something that explodes
when you step on it.]

58:54.630 --> 58:57.030
[I will gladly blow up bigger things
to catch the inspector.]

58:58.100 --> 59:00.830
[How many murders have occurred
in just a month?]

59:01.000 --> 59:03.800
[Please find the answer.]

59:03.900 --> 59:05.670
[I will, no matter what.]
