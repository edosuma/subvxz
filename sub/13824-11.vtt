01:16.326 --> 01:17.827
<i>Ah....</i>

01:17.827 --> 01:22.081
<i>A beautiful, sunny day in the big city.</i>

01:22.081 --> 01:24.250
<i>The birds are twittering.</i>

01:24.250 --> 01:26.419
<i>The squirrels are chattering.</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:31.925
<i>And the construction workers are
jackhammering at 7:00 in the morning!</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:35.637
<i>For the love of Mike,
can't a fella get any sleep around here?!</i>

01:35.637 --> 01:37.138
<i>Sheesh!</i>

01:39.891 --> 01:45.897
<i>Yet the splendor of the big city
is fraught with danger.</i>

01:45.897 --> 01:49.859
<i>Life is just one big accident
waiting to happen.</i>

01:49.859 --> 01:52.946
Hey, Joe, watch where you're
swinging that big piece of wood.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.740
Joe, I said watch
where you're swinging that--

01:58.701 --> 02:01.329
I got a splinter.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.250
I got them too.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.593
Oh, the doctor. Oh, the doctor...

02:21.558 --> 02:24.477
Hey, could you hold it up, fellas?

02:24.477 --> 02:27.772
I need to talk to our guard dog.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.484
Spike, I'm putting you in charge
of this build.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.946
It's up to you to finish on schedule.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.866
You're the foreman now.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.243
It's all up to you, Spike.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.704
We're counting on you.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.468
Hey, you, cat.

02:57.468 --> 03:02.974
Are you sick of chasing after that mouse
and smacking your head into pipes?

03:02.974 --> 03:06.311
You wanna make some real dough?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.857
Well, maybe we can help each other.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.861
You see, I'm in a little pickle
and I need some help here.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.363
How'd you like to be
my new construction crew?

03:17.363 --> 03:19.866
You'll need a hard hat.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.744
That's why you need the hard hat.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.959
Phew.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.652
I've been working hard,
and I deserve a lunch break.

04:11.501 --> 04:15.213
Okay, funny guy,
let's see if you find this amusing.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.698
Ah.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.243
Nothing like a good cup of joe at work.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.426
Listen up, pussycat.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.721
I'm gonna forget that you
nearly brained me with them beams.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.474
But not for disrupting my coffee break.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.351
Now, go back up there
and get to work.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.596
Phew.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.915
Listen up, pussycat.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.544
If this here building ain't complete
by tomorrow morning...

06:59.544 --> 07:02.797
...then I'm gonna lay me out
a new foundation.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.715
Get me?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.594
Okay then. Here's the plans.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.264
Now, get to work, or I'll mortorize you.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.606
Hey, you, get building.

07:32.618 --> 07:37.123
And to think I doubted you, kid.
You're the king of my crew.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.792
Calm down, kid, you finished it.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.462
Yeah, just relax. You should be proud.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.299
Go on. Take a well-earned nap.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.633
You de-- Huh?

07:49.886 --> 07:54.140
My building.
What did you do to my building?

08:32.929 --> 08:37.767
MAN [ON TV]: <i>And now, the winning
numbers for the $68-million jackpot.</i>

08:37.767 --> 08:39.143
<i>Are you ready?</i>

08:39.143 --> 08:42.563
<i>The numbers are 11...</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:47.735
<i>...18, 20, 37.</i>

08:47.735 --> 08:52.448
<i>And the magic bonus number is nine.</i>

09:04.126 --> 09:05.878
Mr. Cat, Mr. Mouse, statement, please.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.797
How does it feel to win the jackpot?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.006
First thing you'll buy?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.925
Decided what to do with your winnings?

09:10.925 --> 09:14.387
Mr. Mouse, how about you?
Oh, come on.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.764
Surely you must have some idea?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.475
You can have cars, vacations.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.312
Hey, you can even leave this hovel
behind and build a new mansion.

09:23.312 --> 09:28.484
And with 34 million apiece,
you can each build your own mansion.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.605
I bet you're ready for us
to get started building your mansion.

10:06.605 --> 10:10.192
But first, it's a matter of monetary
exchange for services rendered.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.528
A 50 percent deposit up front...

10:12.528 --> 10:15.865
...and 10 percent charge
for accepting money from a cat.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.875
Okay, guys.
We got the dough, so let's roll.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.275
Good morning, sir.
We're ready to start.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.278
We'll look over the tile selections
after the ribbon cutting.

10:54.278 --> 10:58.282
Cappuccinos, scones and a complimentary
gift basket are in your trailer.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.993
Thank you so much, sir.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.109
Oh, what now?

11:37.363 --> 11:40.032
Oh, you want a bigger house?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.784
It'll cost you extra.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.749
Nice doing business with you.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.112
So you want us to get back to work?

12:18.112 --> 12:23.659
Well, for your information,
this is our union contract coffee break.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.829
You're in a hurry? Do it yourself.

12:41.343 --> 12:44.680
We're behind schedule with this rebuild.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.683
Keep it coming.

13:06.869 --> 13:11.040
You want a pool now?
Why don't you do it?

13:11.040 --> 13:15.711
All you do is dig a hole,
pour some concrete and just add water.

13:58.712 --> 14:02.174
Well, sir, the crown
molding for your study is in.

14:02.174 --> 14:07.555
The flagstone is finished on the patio
and the tennis courts are done.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.891
Those are the hidden costs.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.769
You should know that by now.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.899
Hmph.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.235
No money, no mansion.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.446
Come on, guys. Shut it down.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.739
Oh, yeah, let's go home.

16:06.882 --> 16:07.841
Ah.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.407
We're gonna have some lunch today.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.701
Boy, I'll say.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.164
Huh?

18:57.594 --> 19:01.640
Hey, what are you doing
in here? Scat. Shoo.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.174
Huh? Hm?

20:38.862 --> 20:42.115
I can't help it. I'm a bulldog.

20:53.543 --> 20:57.130
I'm stuck.
What a revolting development.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.181
Lunchtime.

21:54.271 --> 21:58.191
Oh, was you two just looking
for some lunch all this time?

21:58.191 --> 22:01.695
Well, I can arrange
for youse to get a bite.
