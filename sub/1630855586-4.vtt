00:06.298 --> 00:07.758
<i>As offspring get older,</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:10.928
<i>their lifegivers prepare them
for independence in myriad ways.</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:13.430
And you'll do this every day.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.723
Every day?

00:14.723 --> 00:17.893
<i>It is a long journey with many highs</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:20.145
<i>and lows.</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.189
Time to gain consciousness.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.316
Oh, no.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.027
<i>But what many lifegivers find
is that, at the end of it,</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:29.738
<i>the most emotionally difficult part
of the process</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:31.365
<i>is the moment you succeed.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:34.159
I am ready to leave
and make my own choices now.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.369
Oh, no.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.397
Welcome to Beans & Means.
We have all the beans a being needs.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.816
What can I get for you?

01:05.816 --> 01:07.860
I manage a restaurant across the bay,

01:07.860 --> 01:11.029
and today we're hosting a free
jitter liquid day for our customers.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.740
Our usual jitter liquid tastes like mud,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.952
but I hear you have a special bean
that creates a less-chewable liquid,

01:16.952 --> 01:19.246
so I made the trek here to acquire some.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.706
Is that so?

01:21.206 --> 01:24.001
I may know the beans of which you speak,

01:24.001 --> 01:29.131
the ones whose aroma
have mysterious properties of tranquility.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.340
Do they taste better?

01:30.340 --> 01:31.258
No.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.051
Do they make you feel less jittery?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.011
No.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.804
So, what makes them better?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.598
Do you not listen?

01:37.598 --> 01:41.935
Their aroma has mysterious properties
of tranquility.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.187
What's the catch?

01:43.187 --> 01:45.480
Sometimes it makes you empty your bowels.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.359
<i>Hello?</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:52.029
Hey. I picked up the beans
for Free Jitter Liquid Day.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.114
- Did you start prepping?
- <i>Almost.</i>

01:54.865 --> 01:56.575
You're not even there yet, are you?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.035
<i>No, I am not.</i>

01:59.703 --> 02:02.497
I'm almost ready to get dropped off
at the docks.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.791
I think there are only
a few more bags to go.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.627
Hey, come here.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.878
Look at me. I'm so proud of you.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.716
My baby being going to learnstitution.

02:12.716 --> 02:17.179
I can hardly believe it. It's a great day.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.097
Gratitude.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.891
Hey, look at me again.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.228
- You have a substance on your face.
- Oh, come on.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.903
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

02:32.903 --> 02:34.696
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

02:35.364 --> 02:38.033
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

02:38.033 --> 02:39.660
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

02:40.661 --> 02:42.913
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

02:42.913 --> 02:45.874
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:48.210
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

02:48.210 --> 02:50.879
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:52.965
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:04.226
Did you do your final preparation check?

03:04.226 --> 03:07.187
- That's not a real thing.
- Of course it is.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.440
- Preparation is the key to success.
- I don't think that's always true.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.235
- Did you remember your mouthstone brush?
- Yes.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.612
- Being identification card?
- Yes.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.865
- Emergency fire extinguisher?
- What?

03:19.491 --> 03:20.868
Why would I bring that?

03:20.868 --> 03:25.747
Preparing for every situation
is important, but you refuse to even try.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.124
I'm gonna be just fine.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.459
The way you see the orb,
I must be pretty lucky.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.212
Luck is just the meeting
of preparation and opportunity.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.841
Well, if that's true,
I better pack this vibrating-creature toy,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.468
these striking hand covers,
this screwdriver.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.846
Okay, I see what you're doing.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.515
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.225
What if you get lost? Or sick?

03:45.225 --> 03:48.145
What if you lose your center of gravity
and float off the orb?

03:48.145 --> 03:50.564
I'll ask for directions,
take some medicine,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.482
and make friends
with the outer void beings.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.027
Well, what if the outer void beings
aren't friendly?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.614
Don't forget your favorite
cold slime tubes for the trip.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.365
I don't eat those anymore. They're foul.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.159
And who knows
how long they've been in there.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.828
They're portable and nutritious,
and you love them.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.205
You never know when you'll get hungry.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.249
That's why you always need
to be prepared with snacks.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.213
Careful Now.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.803
Hello.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.348
My apologies.
I thought you were the manager.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.391
How could you get us confused?
Aren't you their sibling?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.936
What? No. Sibling?
Is that how they see me?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.688
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.194
Speaking of, where is the manager?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.488
They're picking up beans
for Free Jitter Liquid Day,

04:39.488 --> 04:42.449
and the owner's out of town, so this is
my first time opening on my own.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.953
Okay, I'll wait. Not for the manager.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.246
For free jitter liquid.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.083
- Sure.
- No, really.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.460
I come every day
to eat your jitter liquid.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.087
To eat it?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.046
Yes.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.381
Is it that bad?

04:57.381 --> 05:00.425
Yes, and I'm comforted
by the consistent lack of quality.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.095
What's in the box?

05:03.095 --> 05:05.889
I'm not sure. Let's open it.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.059
Flip flopper machine.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.187
Too bad we're gonna be so busy today.
I'd love to bust this baby out.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.946
I'm sorry, all.
The groupfloatmachine has broken down.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.740
The next available groupfloat
will be this evening.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.075
This is unacceptable.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.703
Aren't you prepared
with a backup groupfloat if one fails?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.371
Where's the backup?

05:29.371 --> 05:30.664
There aren't any.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.457
- No. No floatmachine?
- Somebody has to have--

05:32.457 --> 05:35.252
- Oh, well.
- I need to get back to my restaurant now.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.963
My coworker could end up burning
the whole place down if I'm not there.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.299
And we need to get to the learnstitution.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.760
It's the first day of Meet Other Beings
and Get Situated Week.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.055
My offspring needs to meet other beings
and get situated.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.432
- I'm a learner.
- Me too.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.349
Same here.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.685
You'll just have to wait. I'm sorry.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.520
There's nothing more I can do
at this time.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.108
I wasn't prepared for this.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.818
There must be another solution.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.530
There is! I can take you across the bay!

06:04.531 --> 06:05.866
Looks safe to me.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.911
Come aboard my vessel, <i>The Chancy</i>.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.705
Are we sure about this?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.916
You literally called it, <i>The Chancy</i>?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.919
It has earned that title.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.672
There are no guarantees on the Big Wet,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.842
but there's always a chance
you'll have fun!

06:23.842 --> 06:24.801
Okay.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.054
- They have a trustworthy face.
- I'll try anything they tell me to.

06:27.054 --> 06:27.971
I'm sold.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.516
This captain seems like they're prepared
for anything.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.684
Anything to get back
before something goes wrong.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.314
Thank you for helping me with my bags.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.108
It's my pleasure, sweetie.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.529
Now let's get on board.
We still have a big wet to cross.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.572
What are you doing?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.366
I'm taking you to learnstitution.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.868
What? No, I can go on my own.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.914
Remember what happened on your very
first day of learning as a tiny being?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.792
That was 15 revolutions ago.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.210
But do you remember what happened?

06:58.210 --> 07:02.339
You cried out for your lifegiver,
and then you fell off a swing.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.299
I think it was the other way around.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.594
You cried,
and I will not let that happen again.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.846
Wha--

07:18.021 --> 07:19.189
You're doing a good job

07:19.189 --> 07:20.524
for your first time on your own.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.317
Gratitude. It's not so bad.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.111
One free jitter liquid, please.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.279
Yes, I know why you're here.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.415
One moment, friend.
I need to brew a new batch.

07:36.415 --> 07:40.377
- It's gotta be here somewhere. Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

07:40.377 --> 07:42.379
We're out of jitter liquid beans.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.173
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Don't panic.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.799
Just call the manager.
That's what I would do.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.759
That's because you have a thing for them.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.636
Hey, is the jitter liquid ready yet?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.097
Fine. You're right. I'll call them.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.268
Careful Now. What's your order?

07:56.268 --> 07:57.311
<i>You called me.</i>

07:57.311 --> 07:59.146
Doesn't mean you don't have an order.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.983
What's going on over there?
Everything okay?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.568
<i>We're out of jitter liquid. What do we do?</i>

08:04.568 --> 08:08.530
Brew hot leaf liquid until I get back.
Can you hear me?

08:08.530 --> 08:09.865
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

08:14.912 --> 08:17.456
What about the new flip flopper machine?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.958
That came already?
I ordered it this morning.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.585
No. Do not open it.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.630
That machine is too complicated
to use without proper training.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.340
It's just a flip flopper machine.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.302
Whatever you do,
do not set up that flip flopper machine.

08:30.302 --> 08:33.222
<i>Are--
Can you hear-- Is the connection cu--</i>

08:33.222 --> 08:35.182
Connection isn't great,
but I think you're saying

08:35.182 --> 08:37.351
I should go ahead and set up
that flip flopper machine.

08:37.351 --> 08:42.438
<i>No, I'm saying the opposite
of that. Tell me you understand.</i>

08:42.438 --> 08:43.941
I understand.

08:43.941 --> 08:47.444
I understand that you're stuck
on the Big Wet, so I gotta take action.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.779
Action on what?

08:48.779 --> 08:50.822
Action on Free Flip Flopper Day.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.366
You're one brilliant being.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.327
Patrons, we have run out of jitter liquid.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.872
- Oh, come on!
- We're setting the restaurant on fire!

08:58.872 --> 09:02.709
But we decided it would be better
if it were Free Flip Flopper Day.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.924
Does anyone have reception?

09:08.924 --> 09:11.343
I'm in the middle
of a flip flopper fiasco.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.011
This is not good.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.681
And it's getting worse.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.934
Would you like some help with that?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.354
Yes. Gratitude.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.442
Is that smell the beans?

09:27.442 --> 09:28.944
So calming.

09:28.944 --> 09:35.117
Yes, the aroma supposedly
has mysterious properties of tranquility.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.079
Very kind of you, offspring.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.002
If that's true,
maybe you should take a whiff.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.503
You look pretty stressed out.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.796
That obvious, huh?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.215
I manage a restaurant,
and we ran out of jitter liquid,

09:50.215 --> 09:53.135
and my least experienced employee
is in charge.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.345
So, naturally, I'm a bit concerned.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.389
Well, there's not much you can do
from here.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.807
Have they let you down before?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.642
This is their first time in charge.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.768
Why do you think they'll fail?

10:01.768 --> 10:05.898
I like to imagine the worst-case scenario
and operate from that vantage point.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.901
Excuse me.
Are you going to learnstitution too?

10:08.901 --> 10:11.695
No, I am a few revolutions past that.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.073
And despite the stress I tend
to bring on myself regarding jitter liquid

10:15.073 --> 10:18.869
and flip flopper machines, I am grateful
to have a face that doesn't crease.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.287
Come along, sweetie.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.748
There are so many learnstitution-bound
beings for us to meet.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.709
Sorry.
I've got my own stress to deal with.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.461
I wish you luck on your bean mission.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.634
I wanted to specialize
in creature studies.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.511
Hello, new friends.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.263
I would like to introduce you
to my offspring.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.892
They too are attending
Beingsburg Learnstitution.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.521
Hello.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.276
Hi. Nice to meet you.

10:51.944 --> 10:55.155
Okay, good introduction. Enjoy the trip.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.540
You need to make acquaintances
with beings to build your support system.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.500
This is how you prepare for life.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.922
If you could let me breathe
for a single second--

11:13.423 --> 11:16.343
The storm is upon us, friends!

11:16.343 --> 11:19.888
This is the adventure we live for!

11:24.935 --> 11:26.687
What would you do without me?

11:26.687 --> 11:31.358
Get soaked and sick, that's what.
See how important it is to be prepared?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.735
Why are you here?

11:33.735 --> 11:36.572
You're the only lifegiver
accompanying their offspring.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.950
Why don't you trust me?
I can handle this on my own.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.161
Well, we can test that theory.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.373
I know plenty of other beings on this boat
will appreciate my nurturing

11:46.373 --> 11:49.209
and preparedness
since you clearly don't need it.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.420
Great! Go nurture them.

11:52.004 --> 11:55.257
I'm gonna nurture them!
I'm gonna nurture them so hard.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.183
Embrace me, Big Wet!

12:05.392 --> 12:09.730
The sea, my love, you always listen to me.

12:09.730 --> 12:13.150
Everything okay up here? I heard yelling.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.902
Have you never been on the Big Wet?

12:14.902 --> 12:17.946
One isn't a captain unless they are
conversing with the sea.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.616
So you don't need help with anything?

12:20.616 --> 12:25.537
Need? All I need is Lorb to grant us
a more thrilling expedition!

12:26.371 --> 12:27.956
Okay.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.421
I wish I had brought snacks.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.964
I'm so hungry, I feel sick.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.884
It's nurturing time.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.765
Flip Floppers!
Flip Floppers! Flip Floppers!

12:44.765 --> 12:47.226
Settle down. Settle down.
We're trying to figure it out.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.561
How do we power it on?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.813
The manual only has
these confusing photos.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.316
Why would someone give directions
like this?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.610
Forget the directions. We got this.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.029
- Push every button?
- Push every button.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.953
Oh, baby. Here they come.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.329
This is a great day.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.499
One at a time. Single file line.
Here we go.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.835
Hey. You're fun, friend.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.378
You're fun too, pal.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.884
Hello, new friends.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.053
Would you like some cold slime tubes
to slurp?

13:23.554 --> 13:24.805
Take 'em. Go ahead.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.432
Hard to pass up a cold slime tube.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.184
It's nutritious and portable.

13:29.977 --> 13:30.811
Gratitude.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.771
You are so welcome.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.565
Who else needs some nurturing?

13:34.565 --> 13:35.482
Me!

13:35.482 --> 13:37.150
- Slime me!
- Gimme the tubes.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.485
Chunky and refreshing.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.445
It's so nice to be appreciated.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.365
Good thing I came prepared.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.577
Otherwise, all these beings would be sick
from hunger.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.923
I imagine you're experiencing
more stress than before?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.759
I am almost certain I can smell
the restaurant burning.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.928
The truth is,
there's nothing you can do from here.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.265
It's either going well or it's not.
And at this point, you can't control it.

14:08.265 --> 14:11.351
That is why I'm experiencing
more stress than before.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.436
Cold slime tube?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.813
- No, gratitude.
- No, thank you.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.065
You can have snacks when you learn
to be prepared.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.527
That is the worst possible snack
to consume on a nautical voyage.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.780
They're right, you know.
It is good to be prepared.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.699
That's how you limit stress and anxiety.

14:25.699 --> 14:30.787
The only stress and anxiety I feel
is from my overbearing lifegiver.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.624
It's sweet that they're so protective
of you though.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.584
They wanna make sure they've set you
on the best path.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.462
I can relate because I tried my best
to prepare my employee,

14:38.462 --> 14:39.796
but I don't think they're ready.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.381
Maybe you did prepare them.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.635
If you trusted them a little more
to handle things on their own,

14:44.635 --> 14:47.221
they could show you
they're perfectly capable.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.224
And what's the worst that could happen?

14:50.224 --> 14:51.725
They learn from their failure.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.772
Or I perish on a groupfloat in the middle
of the Big Wet while my restaurant burns

14:56.772 --> 15:00.651
to the ground, unable to be saved
by the very liquid that led me to perish.

15:00.651 --> 15:03.987
I think you should take a whiff
of your beans.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.032
Do you really believe the aroma
of beans can offer tranquility?

15:07.533 --> 15:08.909
I think it's worth a try.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.328
We really nailed it.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.081
I'm sure they don't even remember
that it was Free Jitter Liquid Day.

15:14.790 --> 15:15.999
What a day.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.545
How do you turn this thing off?

15:21.505 --> 15:22.923
Push every button?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.508
It did work the first time.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.812
Stop, please.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.397
You won't get in trouble.

15:38.397 --> 15:41.608
It's not your fault the machine
is spewing flip floppers.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.860
I wasn't supposed to use it.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.154
When I said Manager gave us permission,
I was not telling the whole truth.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.323
What's the whole truth?

15:48.323 --> 15:50.409
That they did not give us permission.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.870
What? And you made me your accomplice?

15:52.870 --> 15:55.122
Yeah, apologies. Maybe I don't got this.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.214
Not so foul now.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.887
Passengers!
The funnest part of the storm is upon us.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.763
Hang on to your foot tubes.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.473
What is fun about this?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.810
I'm hanging on to my foot tubes,
but I don't think it's helping.

16:17.311 --> 16:18.604
I don't feel good.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.397
I'm here for you, friend.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.733
Maybe you need
to slurp a little more slime tube?

16:23.275 --> 16:24.818
Oh, no. The slime.

16:31.158 --> 16:37.414
<i>With anchor drawn and the floatsails set
We brave the waves of the old Big Wet</i>

16:37.998 --> 16:43.795
<i>Creatures low, and the swells up high
Terror awaits in the sea storm's eye</i>

16:44.379 --> 16:50.636
<i>When your bones are aquake with fear
Scream to the sky, for Rorb to hear</i>

16:50.636 --> 16:57.226
<i>"Yo-ho-ho, I face the sea
The liquid shan't make a fool of me!"</i>

16:59.853 --> 17:03.607
<i>The liquid shan't make a fool of me!</i>

17:09.154 --> 17:10.155
Any ideas?

17:10.656 --> 17:13.242
Is there a flip flopper expert
in the house?

17:13.825 --> 17:15.452
I'm a flip flopper expert.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.744
What were the odds of that?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.957
Can you turn this thing off?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.255
Why didn't you do that in the first place?

17:26.255 --> 17:28.549
We all thought this was part
of the celebration.

17:28.549 --> 17:29.925
Gratitude.

17:29.925 --> 17:32.344
What are we going to do
with all these flip floppers?

17:32.344 --> 17:34.137
I don't know, eat them?

17:34.137 --> 17:35.556
It's worth a shot.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.059
Oh, Lorb. We can't do this.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.186
I'm so full.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.230
I wish my stomach were an empty void.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.149
If only our bodies were an endless,

17:46.149 --> 17:50.237
gaping expanse
like that expanse mocking us outside.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.207
That is exactly the adventure
we all needed!

18:02.207 --> 18:06.461
Not to worry.
I'll have us back to shore in no time.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.255
As soon as I'm done.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.177
Oh, my Lorb. I made everyone sick.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.179
That was wild!

18:15.179 --> 18:17.222
This being gets it.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.224
Are you doing okay?

18:19.224 --> 18:23.187
I am experiencing a sensation
I have never experienced.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.314
Can you describe it?

18:25.314 --> 18:28.817
It's positive and calm.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.068
Do you like this feeling?

18:30.068 --> 18:34.489
I do. I am no longer concerned
that the restaurant will burn down,

18:34.489 --> 18:38.327
though I would prefer that it didn't.
I just feel better.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.331
It's the beans!

18:42.831 --> 18:44.208
Oh, my Lorb.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.212
We need to get the beings
to sniff the beans.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.005
I don't have anything to open the barrel.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.091
I may have luckily prepared
for just this opportunity.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.407
Lifegiver, I don't say this lightly,
but you were right.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.493
You need to sniff these beans.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.788
I never said anything
about sniffing beans.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.332
Take a whiff of these.

19:29.419 --> 19:33.006
I feel my fears dissipating
through my face holes.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.091
How did you--

19:35.050 --> 19:38.011
I'm lucky you figured out
how to quell my worry.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.847
You know,
sometimes luck is just the meeting

19:39.847 --> 19:41.890
of preparation and opportunity.

19:42.641 --> 19:45.060
You know, I heard that somewhere.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.521
Help me cure the beings?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.857
I'm always here to help.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.874
Sniff these.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.127
Great.

20:10.127 --> 20:14.756
Divine spirit of the sea,
you have finally embraced me!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.855
Can this experience stay between us?

20:29.855 --> 20:32.524
I would not wanna cause
the manager any more stress.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.734
Deal.

20:39.281 --> 20:43.285
Hey, you did a really great job today.
The manager would be impressed.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.538
Thanks. I think Manager would be elated
to know how much you helped.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.374
They're really lucky to have us.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.420
Land, ho!

21:04.515 --> 21:08.393
On to my next brush with perishing. Yes.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.273
I apologize for being so overbearing.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.318
It's my job to prepare you
to be independent,

21:16.318 --> 21:18.529
but I wasn't prepared for when you were.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.990
It's okay,
but you need to see you have prepared me.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.283
I do.

21:23.909 --> 21:27.079
Ready to continue our journey
to the learnstitution?

21:27.079 --> 21:28.956
I think you got it from here.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.167
Thank you.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.966
They leave us so slowly
and then all at once.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.717
They'll be okay, right?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.304
They'll be more than okay.
You did a great job.

21:44.847 --> 21:45.848
Thank you.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.934
Though I can never again eat a slime tube.

21:57.818 --> 22:00.612
Greets. Beans are here.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.992
Okay. Do you wanna talk about anything?

22:04.992 --> 22:05.909
How'd it go?

22:05.909 --> 22:07.703
It went great. Yeah.

22:07.703 --> 22:10.998
Great. Thanks for handling that.
I'm proud of you.

22:14.418 --> 22:18.130
Manager's back... if you wanna see them.

22:18.755 --> 22:22.593
I saw. I'll give them some space.
I'm enjoying hanging with you.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.511
Flip flopper fight?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.305
Flip flopper fight.

22:26.305 --> 22:27.806
I'm gonna get you. I'ma get you.
