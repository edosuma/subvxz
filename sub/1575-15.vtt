00:03.125 --> 00:05.333
It's family game night
at the Smiths'!

00:05.333 --> 00:07.166
Welcome back.
I'm your host Tuttle.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.125
And we're playing
"The Newlywed Game."

00:09.125 --> 00:10.834
I'm not
part of your family.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.083
I want to go home.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.375
But you're doing
a great job!

00:13.375 --> 00:15.208
Also,
remember our arrangement!

00:15.208 --> 00:18.041
You host,
or you get this.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.792
All right, gentlemen,
let's see how well

00:20.792 --> 00:23.417
your wives have predicted
what you will say.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.750
Francine,
the question was,

00:25.750 --> 00:28.083
"Who is your husband's
personal hero?"

00:28.083 --> 00:32.417
That's easy. He has all his
cookbooks, DVDs, and posters.

00:32.417 --> 00:36.375
Stan's hero is...
Guy Fieri!

00:36.375 --> 00:37.625
Mwah!

00:37.625 --> 00:40.125
Fieri's the coolest cat
in America,

00:40.125 --> 00:42.875
shakin' his tail feather
with the five S's --

00:42.875 --> 00:45.333
style, smile,
sickness, slickness,

00:45.333 --> 00:48.000
and smoked meats
that are oh-so-tender.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.542
And guess what, kiddies?

00:49.542 --> 00:52.041
He's in town
scouting locations

00:52.041 --> 00:54.709
for "Diners, Drive-Ins,
and Dives!"

00:54.709 --> 00:56.875
Lookie here, baby.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.709
Uh-huh!

00:58.709 --> 01:00.458
Klaus, we're playing a game
here.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.750
Well, it's game on
for Klaus, too.

01:02.750 --> 01:06.542
I'm taking my new outfit out
tonight to score some honeys.

01:08.417 --> 01:10.125
Whatever.
Go to hell.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.083
No you, Klaus!

01:12.083 --> 01:15.750
Now. to our leading couple who
have not missed a question yet.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.750
Hayley, who is your husband's
personal hero?

01:18.750 --> 01:21.375
That would be
Ben Dronkers.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.500
Mwah!

01:22.500 --> 01:24.583
Ben Dronkers?
Who the hell's that?

01:24.583 --> 01:29.291
He created Gorilla Glue #4,
Jeff's favorite strain of weed.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.542
Hayley, don't say "favorite"
so loud!

01:31.542 --> 01:33.041
The other weeds
will hear you!

01:33.041 --> 01:35.250
Every one of Jeff's answers
is marijuana-related.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.542
It's why they're winning.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.291
His only interest
is getting stoned!

01:38.291 --> 01:40.750
Dad! He's got no job, no future!

01:40.750 --> 01:43.208
There's nothing to him
besides smoking pot!

01:43.208 --> 01:45.709
Mr. S.,
you're stressing me out!

01:47.834 --> 01:49.625
Tuttle!

01:49.625 --> 01:51.583
Let "The Newlywed Game" records
show

01:51.583 --> 01:53.625
my son-in-law
has no identity!

01:53.625 --> 01:57.166
Hate to be the guy
he's mad at.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.750
Maybe your dad's right.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.625
Maybe my identity
is all about weed.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.417
I don't know if "maybe"
is the right word.

02:37.417 --> 02:39.834
I need to take a walk
and think things over.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.834
Want me to go with
you, babe? Nah.

02:41.834 --> 02:45.583
I'm just gonna go do some
circles in the laundry room.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.667
I've been eavesdropping.
Oh.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.333
But I do agree,
you need an identity,

02:53.333 --> 02:56.000
and a great way to do that --
get a job!

02:56.000 --> 02:59.375
A job?
I better talk to Hayley.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.834
She'll know
what she wants me to do.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.500
Hayley. Yes.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.500
I was just talking to
our mutual friend Hayley.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.250
Hayley:
You can leave that open!

03:08.250 --> 03:10.709
Jeff, I hate to plant this idea
in your head,

03:10.709 --> 03:12.458
but Hayley's also
been complaining

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
that you have
no identity/job.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.750
Oh, no!

03:18.083 --> 03:19.875
Wait, I like pizza.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.333
Maybe I could get a job
answering doors

03:22.333 --> 03:24.000
for people
who order pizza.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.291
Like at parties!
Or...?

03:26.291 --> 03:30.875
What if I got a job
working at a pizza place?

03:33.458 --> 03:36.417
I think
that might be genius.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.583
I wonder if my identity

03:44.583 --> 03:47.667
is someone
who puts olives on a pizza.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.667
Not bad.
Just the right amount of grime.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.458
Holy legit-a-moly, boys,
we may have found a dive!

03:58.667 --> 04:01.250
I don't think you're allowed
to just grab that.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.125
Pal, don't you know
who that is?

04:04.125 --> 04:06.000
Some county treasurer?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.750
That's Guy Fieri!

04:07.750 --> 04:10.834
Shh! Don't interrupt!
He's about to hunch!

04:10.834 --> 04:14.750
Mmm!

04:14.750 --> 04:17.583
I'm getting the fennel and
fattiness from the sausage,

04:17.583 --> 04:20.250
a nice kick of Cayenne
in the sauce.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.875
Buddy! Talk about
packing up the taste buds

04:22.875 --> 04:25.250
for a weekend trip
to Flavortown!

04:25.250 --> 04:26.792
Is that good?

04:26.792 --> 04:29.417
He asked if that's good.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.500
Hey, Guy,
check this dude out!

04:31.500 --> 04:33.208
He looks like you!

04:33.208 --> 04:34.875
I'm not really seeing it.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.709
I swear, boss!
Let me show you.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.041
A little more mustache,
some cool earrings.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.208
There it is!
I see the resemblance.

04:42.208 --> 04:46.875
Something about this dude who
looks like me that I just like.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.166
Brother, you have got to
hang with us.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.166
No way!

04:53.375 --> 04:59.250
Out on the town, and everyone's
checking out my new outfit.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.083
Excuse me.
It's on.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.291
So, baby, what's your
name? Black Nissan.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.792
You think I'm some car valet

05:06.792 --> 05:09.834
because of my white shirt,
my bow tie, my sweet vest,

05:09.834 --> 05:12.834
my foreign accent --
Oh, balls.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.625
Hold on, maybe we
just go with it.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.875
Could be a great opportunity
to pick up a few bucks.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.166
And a lucky break, too.
I don't have a dime on me.

05:19.166 --> 05:22.000
Nothing? You told me you were
paying for the evening!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.083
I see
what happened here.

05:24.083 --> 05:27.917
I was lying to you, Klaus.
I don't respect you.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.542
Anything interesting
happen at work?

05:31.542 --> 05:34.000
I found an olive slice
that looked like a doughnut.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.667
Well, no wonder
you're so tired.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.500
Oh, and, also,
Guy Fieri came in.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.041
He asked me
to hang out with him

05:40.041 --> 05:43.542
and some friends of his
he calls the Pesto Crew.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.750
Guy Fieri asked you
to join his posse?

05:45.750 --> 05:49.250
Yeah, but they seem kind of
weird, so I think I'll pass.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.834
Well, if you're not interested,
then you shouldn't --

05:54.083 --> 05:55.792
Shut up! Shut up!

05:55.792 --> 05:58.542
Jeff, don't make the biggest
mistake of your life!

05:58.542 --> 06:01.834
Guy Fieri has tapped you
to join the Pesto Crew.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.458
Do you know
what that means?

06:03.458 --> 06:06.667
Mr. S., you just said
25 words in a row.

06:06.667 --> 06:11.125
People don't think I count
words, but sometimes I do.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.625
Jeff,
this is your identity!

06:13.625 --> 06:15.250
It is?
Yes!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.834
What greater identity
is there

06:16.834 --> 06:19.041
than giving me access
to Guy Fieri?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.917
It doesn't seem like I'd fit in
with -- Don't disappoint Hayley.

06:21.917 --> 06:24.291
But she said she didn't
care -- Eh, eh, eh, eh!

06:24.291 --> 06:27.542
Sounds like what a divorce
lawyer might advise her to say.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.792
A d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d?!

06:29.792 --> 06:30.875
Divorce.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.709
So if you want to
save your marriage,

06:32.709 --> 06:34.417
you'll join
the Pesto Crew.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.250
It's exactly
what Hayley craves.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.500
How do you know?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.959
Because we share
the same sperm-DNA.

06:39.959 --> 06:42.083
Everything I like,
she likes, too.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.000
It's genetics.
Of course.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.291
Genetics!

06:45.291 --> 06:48.083
Oh, my God, Jeff, are you
making the case to me,

06:48.083 --> 06:51.750
scientifically, that you need to
join the Pesto Crew?

06:54.125 --> 06:57.375
You've done it again.

they'd only serve ribs

and it would be called "Guy's
Art-Town Motorcycle Munchies."

07:36.125 --> 07:38.542
Hayley, I'd like to
take this opportunity

07:38.542 --> 07:40.875
to congratulate you
on your marriage to Jeff.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.959
Dad, you could have said that
at my wedding

07:42.959 --> 07:45.625
instead of demanding that the
band play more "white" music.

my application.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.000
I refuse this.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.750
Jeff, I hate hearing
that you want to leave.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.208
But I agree with you.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.625
You shouldn't be
in the Pesto Crew.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.458
You should be its leader.

11:01.458 --> 11:05.041
I haven't announced it yet,
but I'm retiring.

11:05.041 --> 11:09.291

to run my empire.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.375
Me? Why?

11:11.375 --> 11:15.500
You have the stuff to be Chief
Junkyard Dog of Flavortown.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.959
That sounds amazing.

11:18.959 --> 11:20.625
It's just that Hayley --

11:20.625 --> 11:22.208
Do it, you maroon!
But --

11:22.208 --> 11:24.125
She didn't like when
you were a hanger-on.

11:24.125 --> 11:27.875
But if you were the one
others were hanging onto,

11:27.875 --> 11:29.125
Hayley would eat it up!

11:29.125 --> 11:31.291
Like a Big Bite Motley-Q
Sandwich

11:31.291 --> 11:33.375
dripping with donkey sauce!
She said--

11:33.375 --> 11:36.125
Remember, this is coming from
your future number-one toadie,

11:36.125 --> 11:38.667
so you know I'm giving it
to you straight.

11:38.667 --> 11:44.125
I think you're right.
This is something I need to do.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.750
Mr. Fieri, I accept your offer
to run the empire.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.458
Gangster choice.
To the new Guy Fieri!

you were going to quit!

Quiet, please!

No shirt, no shoes,
no problem!

you would quit the Pesto Crew.

my signature spicy ketchup,

I can't explain it,

when you have questions, there's
only one place to get answers --

14:15.041 --> 14:17.333
the Public Library.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.583
I could have sworn this homeless
shelter was once a library.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.458
It is a library.

In that case, I'm looking for
information on Guy Fieri.

Let's start by cross-referencing
it with anything supernatural --

14:29.792 --> 14:31.208

Time-Life's "Mysteries
of the Unknown" series.

a mischievous ancient demon

14:40.542 --> 14:43.375

the dawn of mankind.

it eats its weight in food

When diabetes
inevitably sets in,

the demon must exit the body
and migrate into a younger one.

its never-ending quest

15:00.667 --> 15:04.250
for bold flavors, boisterous
compadres, pinkie rings..."

What up, goose?

15:20.333 --> 15:22.250
And the only way
to remove the demon

15:22.250 --> 15:26.291
is to return it to where it was
born long ago -- Flavortown.
