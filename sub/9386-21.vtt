WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.922
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.005 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:11.762
But where are
those good old-fashioned values

00:11.845 --> 00:14.515
On which we
used to rely?

00:14.598 --> 00:17.935
Lucky there's
a family guy

00:18.018 --> 00:21.647
Lucky there's
a man who positively can do

00:21.730 --> 00:23.273
All the things
that make us

00:23.357 --> 00:25.108
Laugh and cry

00:25.192 --> 00:30.030
He's a family guy

00:34.952 --> 00:36.787
All right, Peter.
You made it to the bonus round.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.372
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Regis.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.958
REGIS: Okay, the category
is "Actor and Show."

00:41.041 --> 00:43.418
So, we need
five consonants and a vowel.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.546
Oh, okay. Um...

00:46.129 --> 00:48.549
"Z." Four.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.884
"Q."

00:52.177 --> 00:53.554
Another "Q."

00:54.388 --> 00:55.806
Uh...

00:56.557 --> 00:58.559
A third "Q."

00:58.642 --> 01:00.310
And the Batman symbol.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.313
REGIS: Okay, no help
there. Fifteen seconds.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.232
If you want to take
a shot at it, talk it out.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.734
Is it Alex Karras
in Webster?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.654
I don't believe it.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.074
Oh, my God! I just took
a shot in the dark! Holy crap!

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
Okay. You have $1,300.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.621
Why don't you go ahead and pick out
some prizes from our showcase?

01:19.705 --> 01:24.084
Okay, let's see.
Oh, boy! Everything looks nice. Um...

01:24.168 --> 01:27.421
All right, I'll take
the ceramic Dalmatian for $600.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.174
And, uh, boy,
that TV looks nice.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.635
Uh, give me the
one free week of maid service.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.138
And, uh, I'll take
the hat rack.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.724
Um, hey, how much
for that fat guy in the circle?

01:38.807 --> 01:40.350
I don't see
a price tag on that.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
-REGIS: That's you.
-Oh, oh, embarrassing.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.522
Okay, well, in that case,
I'll take the rest on a gift certificate.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.525
Oh, sweetie,
you look so handsome on TV.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.068
I can't believe
you actually won.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.695
But I suppose it's not
the strangest thing

01:51.778 --> 01:52.779
I've seen on a game show.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.073
Like when Adam West
was on Jeopardy.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.367
All right, players.
The answer once again is,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.453
"It was the
first spacecraft

01:59.536 --> 02:01.246
to land on the surface
of Mars."

02:01.330 --> 02:02.956
Adam, what was
your response?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.044
"Kebert Xela."

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
-(scream)
-(zap)

02:09.796 --> 02:11.215
Only saying
his name backwards

02:11.298 --> 02:14.718
can send him back
to the fifth dimension, where he belongs.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.558
All right,
whip them out, woman.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.060
It's time for
the afternoon meal.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.812
My goodness, Stewie.
I guess you're hungry.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.442
Honey, not so
rough this time. Mommy's very sore.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.735
And, by the way,
let's be clear.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.028
I only like you
as a friend.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.613
(doorbell rings)

02:36.073 --> 02:38.992
Hi. I'm Joan.
I'm your maid for the week.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.287
Me Peter. You maid.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.706
Um, I do speak English.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.669
You maid,
clean for me, Peter.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.338
You clean Peter mess.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.674
Peter, stop it.
Welcome to our home, Joan.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.300
I'm Lois.
Won't you come in?

02:55.384 --> 02:57.135
Oh, boy! My own maid.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.428
This is gonna
kick more ass

02:58.512 --> 02:59.930
than that magical
ride I took.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.641
It's the Great
Space Coaster

03:02.724 --> 03:05.936
Get on board,
on the Great Space Coaster

03:06.019 --> 03:09.565
We'll explore,
a comet ride of fantasy

03:09.648 --> 03:13.569
To a place where dreams
fly fast and free

03:13.652 --> 03:16.113
With new friends
and new things to see

03:16.196 --> 03:19.074
We'll spin you
through the galaxy

03:24.538 --> 03:26.582
Well, we are
officially lost.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.292
On the Great
Space Coas--

03:28.375 --> 03:30.085
Shut up, Ricky!
Just shut up right now!

03:30.169 --> 03:32.296
Unless the next words
out of your mouth are directions

03:32.379 --> 03:33.881
how to get back
to the fish skeleton,

03:33.964 --> 03:35.716
I'm gonna punch you
right in the stomach!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.511
Joan, it's great
to have you here.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.722
No one's cleaned
my belly button in a long time.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.182
Lois is afraid
to go near there

03:43.265 --> 03:44.808
and my fingers
are too thick.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.977
What is this?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.980
A carton of Parliaments?
I haven't smoked in 10 years.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.064
Hey, keep digging.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.318
Oh, ColecoVision.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.653
Yeah! This could be
a fun afternoon.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.242
JOAN: Mr. Griffin,
this is unbelievably humiliating.

04:02.326 --> 04:06.413
Hey, hey, Lois wants me to go to the store
and the car's low on gas.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.753
Oh, crap!

04:12.836 --> 04:16.840
This is truly
a sight to behold. An awesome spectacle.

04:16.924 --> 04:20.469
Peter Griffin, a once great champion
of the motor speedway

04:20.552 --> 04:23.096
now a study in
moppishness.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.057
-The hell I am!
-(dings)

04:25.140 --> 04:26.141
Ya!

04:28.852 --> 04:31.271
-ANNOUNCER: We now return to Malcolm
-in the Middle.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.190
And I told you boys
to pick up your clothes!

04:33.273 --> 04:34.691
And who left the wet
towel on the bed?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
I swear to God, sometimes I feel like
just going on strike!

04:36.860 --> 04:39.279
What would you all do if I went on strike?
Huh? What would you do?

04:39.363 --> 04:42.032
I'm talking to you!
You know what? That's what I'm gonna do!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.826
I'm gonna go on strike!
And you can all try living without me!

04:44.910 --> 04:46.537
You didn't think
about that, huh?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.164
That's what I'm gonna do!
I'm gonna do that! I'm gonna do tha--

04:51.041 --> 04:54.002
Kids, we're free.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.796
We're finally free.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.183
LOIS: Ouch.
Damn, that hurts.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.393
What happened?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.770
I was breast-feeding
Stewie, and he bit me again.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.064
I think he might have
even broken the skin.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.732
I see. Um...

05:15.816 --> 05:19.486
Maybe I should, uh,
you know, uh, look at it.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.864
I, uh-- I, uh...

05:21.947 --> 05:24.825
I have seen
a lot of medical shows.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.287
You see, the areola
is very tender here.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.580
And I think one of his
new teeth may have

05:29.663 --> 05:31.164
bitten down
right on a duct.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.544
I'm sorry. What?

05:35.627 --> 05:37.004
I don't know
what to do, Brian.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.755
Breast-feeding's
just so painful

05:38.839 --> 05:40.465
since Stewie's teeth
are coming in.

05:40.549 --> 05:43.635
Now I know how Alec
Baldwin feels when he feeds his brothers.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.929
There you go.
There you go.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.973
Eat up, Stephen.
You're the weakest.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.017
Well, maybe it's time
to wean Stewie.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.895
Huh. I suppose it would
make my life easier.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.646
You know what?
I'll give it a try.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.316
-Thanks, Brian.
-No problem.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.652
(stuttering)
Uh... Any other problems you have, too,

06:00.736 --> 06:03.530
like, for example,
around your underpants

06:03.614 --> 06:04.656
that you want me
to take a look at,

06:04.740 --> 06:07.242
-I could take a look at that, too.
-Huh?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.245
Please pull down
your underpants.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.166
All right, boys.
It's my maid's last night,

06:14.249 --> 06:16.126
so we got to
make the most of it. Now, I filled

06:16.210 --> 06:19.505
this watermelon with chocolate pudding
and M-80 firecrackers.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.341
Hey, Meg.
Will you hold this for Daddy?

06:22.424 --> 06:23.800
Okay. Why?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.511
Uh, it's a present.

06:25.594 --> 06:29.264
It's a thanks-
for-being-such-a- sweetie watermelon.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.474
So you'll hang
onto that?

06:30.557 --> 06:31.558
Yeah, sure.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.851
(yells fearfully)

06:32.935 --> 06:35.103
This is weird.
Am I supposed to eat this?

06:35.187 --> 06:36.188
(scream)

06:36.355 --> 06:39.525
I hate you! I hate you!

06:39.608 --> 06:41.777
Oh, maid!

06:42.528 --> 06:44.196
Oh, my God!

06:44.279 --> 06:45.614
Everybody,
this is Joan.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.865
-Hi.
-Hello.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.368
(romantic music playing)

06:55.415 --> 06:58.961
(speaks elf language)

07:03.131 --> 07:07.636
(speaks elf language)

07:09.096 --> 07:10.222
Uh, uh, hey, there.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.266
Uh, I mean, it's n-nice
to pleasure your acquaintance.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.061
Uh, I mean, w-would you like
to go out to dinner tomorrow night?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.229
I'd love to.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.313
God, he works fast.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.483
Hey, Quagmire,
is that a banana in your pocket

07:21.567 --> 07:23.569
or a (bleeps)
in your pocket?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.445
Do you want to say 9:00?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.823
Sure. See you then.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.579
Oh, my God! I'm in love.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.248
(romantic music playing)

08:02.232 --> 08:04.151
(sighs)

08:04.234 --> 08:05.652
Time for dinner,
sweetie.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.196
Very well, then.
Take off your shirt.

08:07.279 --> 08:11.241
No, honey. No, no.
Tonight we're gonna have formula instead.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.786
Ah! Ugh! That's
more disgusting

08:14.870 --> 08:17.122
than when Peter
went through that Daisy Dukes phase.

08:17.206 --> 08:20.042
So who's up
for some hoops at the park, huh?

08:20.125 --> 08:23.670
Oh, there you are.
Come here, you basketball.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.964
(both scream)

08:26.048 --> 08:27.591
It's like
a walrus flossing.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.801
I-I know it's different
than you're used to,

08:29.885 --> 08:31.678
but you'll see
it's just as good.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.138
Yes. That's what
we were promised

08:33.222 --> 08:37.267
about Jim Belushi
some 25 laugh-free years ago.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.606
Wow, it's so
lovely here, Glenn.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.775
Well, this is our
three-week anniversary, Joan.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.193
I wanted this date
to be special.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.695
You know, this place
is unique because if you're lucky,

08:48.779 --> 08:50.113
some nights
around sunset,

08:50.197 --> 08:52.032
the screaming black
dolphins come out.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.953
Oh, wow! Really?
I've heard they're just beautiful.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.788
DOLPHIN (in African-American accent):
What's going on, man?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.540
DOLPHIN 2:
Who's-- Oh, what's going on yourself?

08:59.623 --> 09:00.624
(dolphins laugh)

09:00.707 --> 09:01.708
I almost drowned yesterday.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.294
Oh, man!
It's wet out here.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.838
Oh, look at them.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.422
They're magical,
aren't they?

09:07.506 --> 09:08.507
Listen, Joan...

09:08.590 --> 09:10.717
I have something very
important to ask you.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.135
-DOLPHIN: Hey, James.
-DOLPHIN 2: Mm-hmm.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.263
DOLPHIN: I'm gonna see
how long I can hold my breath.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.056
DOLPHIN 2:
I see you breathing out your hole.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.182
What is it, Glenn?

09:17.266 --> 09:20.227
Joan, I've decided
I want to spend my life with you.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.229
-Will you marry me?
-(gasps)

09:22.312 --> 09:24.189
Oh! Of course I will.

09:24.273 --> 09:29.152
Nothing would make
me happier than to be Mrs. Quagmire.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.198
DOLPHIN: Hey, man.
I see you got some seaweed on your tail.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.700
DOLPHIN 2:
Where? What? Oh!

09:34.783 --> 09:36.076
DOLPHIN: You know I'm
just playing with you.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.327
DOLPHIN 2:
Man, you are--

09:37.411 --> 09:39.538
Oh, I thought
you was talking about the other seaweed.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.373
DOLPHIN:
You know I got jokes!

09:41.456 --> 09:43.125
(dolphins laugh)

09:43.208 --> 09:45.043
DOLPHIN 2:
I'm gonna slap you with my fin.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.050
Man, I never would
have thought

09:52.134 --> 09:53.927
Quagmire'd get married.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.512
No, no.
I know Quagmire.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.140
And I'm telling you,
this has got to be some kind of prank.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.475
You know, like that
prank I pulled on Ashton Kutcher.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.227
Ashton, come here.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.730
Ha ha ha.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.273
You've just been
tomahawked.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.067
That's my show.
Tomahawked.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.906
So, how's the
weaning going?

10:13.989 --> 10:15.365
Oh, it's horrible.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.118
Giving up breast milk
is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.453
I'll bet the
founding fathers

10:19.536 --> 10:21.788
had an easier
time writing the Bill of Rights.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.207
All right, we're done.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.209
You think the language
in the Second Amendment is clear enough?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.793
You know, about the
right to bear arms?

10:26.877 --> 10:27.878
Of course it's clear.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.962
Every American
has the right

10:29.046 --> 10:31.048
to hang a pair of bear
arms on their wall.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.799
How could that possibly
be misconstrued?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.510
All right.
Fantastic then.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.012
Wait. You know what?
Before we send this to the printer,

10:37.095 --> 10:38.972
let's take that
abortion thing out.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.142
Boy, I never thought

10:42.226 --> 10:44.478
we'd be going to
Quagmire's for an engagement party.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.647
I'm telling you guys,
he's putting us on.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.023
He's the same
old Quagmire.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.901
Hey there, neighbors.
Are you lost? Aha ha.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.277
I'm just joshing.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.363
Of course we're
expecting you. Come on in, friends.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.825
Uh-uh, if you
all will just

10:58.909 --> 11:00.118
take your shoes
off there.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.412
Joan and I kind of
do the Japanese thing.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.208
(thinks)
Uh-oh, foot odor.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.668
I have to go.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.880
I have, uh,
terrible foot odor.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.258
Glenn, your place
looks wonderful.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.677
I feel like I can touch
things in here now.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.679
We brought you guys
a bottle of wine.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.431
BOTH: Ooooh, Montrachet!

11:21.515 --> 11:23.433
I like our friends.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.562
So, Joan and I just love
Without a Trace, don't we, honey?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.063
-Yeah, it's all right.
-We think it's all right.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.399
What are you
talking about? You hate CBS.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.817
Ooh. "Hate" is a word

11:31.900 --> 11:33.277
we don't use
in this house.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.486
Joan and I always say,

11:34.570 --> 11:36.196
"If you don't have
anything nice to say about someone,

11:36.280 --> 11:37.531
don't say
anything at all."

11:37.614 --> 11:38.699
We say that,
right, honey?

11:38.782 --> 11:40.534
-Sometimes.
-Sometimes we say that.

11:41.785 --> 11:42.870
Hey, Quagmire.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.038
Check out this month's
Hustler, huh?

11:45.122 --> 11:47.207
-Quagmire?
-Now, this is neat.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.960
These people have put
an old-fashioned Colonial spinning wheel

11:50.043 --> 11:53.338
in the center
of their living room, as furniture.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.216
Oh, that's what I want
in my house.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.428
(pop music)

11:59.511 --> 12:01.972
All right, Quagmire.
Time for your lap dance.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.640
No, guys. I
can't do that.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.766
It's degrading to women.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.894
Come on, Quagmire.
It's got to be you.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.562
I'm married,
Cleveland's got foot odor,

12:08.645 --> 12:10.397
and Joe's dead
from the waist down.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.566
Aaaaagh!

12:12.649 --> 12:14.985
Why do you
bring me here?

12:16.695 --> 12:19.323
Oh, Brian, my breasts
are so sore.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.742
And they've gotten
so engorged from the weaning,

12:21.825 --> 12:23.744
I've gone up
two bra sizes.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.496
What-- What did you do
with the old bras?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.166
Okay. Got to time this
just right.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.421
One, two, three!

12:34.505 --> 12:36.089
(screams)

12:36.173 --> 12:38.550
Help! Somebody
get this baby off me!

12:38.634 --> 12:40.594
Stewie! I'm so sorry.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.388
By the way, you
call those cheap implants boobs?

12:43.472 --> 12:46.183
Those aren't boobs.
They are lies!

12:47.976 --> 12:49.186
I can't believe it.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.855
Quagmire's gone
all sissy-man Alan Alda on us!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.524
Well, what can
we do about it?

12:53.607 --> 12:54.900
The wedding's tomorrow.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.693
There's only
one thing to do.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.529
We got to break it up.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.617
Gosh, Peter,
thanks so much for being my best man.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.826
Oh, it's my pleasure.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.412
In fact, I got a
wedding surprise for you.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.456
All right, back
it up, guys.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.832
I know you have
a foot fetish

13:10.916 --> 13:13.252
so I got you
this Statue of Liberty's foot.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.463
Oh, thanks, Peter.
But Joan's all the foot I need now.

13:16.547 --> 13:20.300
What? But, Quagmire,
that's the real foot from the Statue of--

13:20.384 --> 13:21.510
No, no. I'm okay.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.095
Hey, do you have any idea

13:23.178 --> 13:24.596
what I went through
to get this?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.473
A lot. A real lot.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.600
You think this is just,
"Oh, here comes Peter

13:28.684 --> 13:29.935
"with the Statue of
Liberty's foot.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.019
Oh, isn't that a gas?"

13:31.103 --> 13:33.689
No. No. The reality,
the real reality

13:33.772 --> 13:35.649
of getting this
together was staggering.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.820
You know, this cost
me $437,000.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.113
Don't ask me
how I got it.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.865
I had to call in a
whole bunch of favors

13:42.948 --> 13:44.491
from people
I've never even met.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.826
So the very least
you can do

13:45.909 --> 13:47.703
is just rub up against--
I don't know.

13:47.786 --> 13:48.912
Well, if you
want I can--

13:48.996 --> 13:50.205
No, no. No,
no, it's fine.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.291
No. Whatever.
Whatever. Just go to your wedding, man.

13:52.374 --> 13:53.709
(speaks Spanish)

13:53.792 --> 13:56.211
No. No. No. No. Take--
Just get it out of here.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.425
Peter, what's
the matter?

14:01.508 --> 14:02.801
This is a happy
occasion.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.511
No, it's not, Lois.
It's horrible.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.722
You don't know what happens to a man
when he gets married.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.892
It's like a disease that rots you
from the inside out.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.560
-I know, Peter, but...
-(snaps)

14:11.643 --> 14:13.729
Oh, damn it.
I can't believe

14:13.812 --> 14:15.731
how much my breasts
have swollen.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.024
(gasps)

14:21.486 --> 14:24.198
Oh, look out.
Champagne.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.324
Peter, stop.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.119
Oh, Lois,
you're all wet.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.746
Here, let me
jiggle you dry.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.623
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

14:34.541 --> 14:35.876
Giggity giggity God!

14:35.959 --> 14:37.711
I've made a
terrible mistake!

14:37.794 --> 14:40.380
(sobs)

14:42.841 --> 14:45.844
Oh, my god!
You blew it up!

14:45.928 --> 14:48.013
You really did it!

14:48.096 --> 14:51.600
Damn you all to hell!

14:59.274 --> 15:01.235
Oh, God. I got to get
out of this marriage!

15:01.318 --> 15:02.819
Cleveland, how did you
get out of yours?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.238
You slept
with my wife.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.449
It's easy, Quagmire.
Just tell her to hit the bricks.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.660
Yeah. You've
gotten out of commitments before.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.620
Wow, that was great.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.996
Sure was. See you.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.957
But you said we were
gonna get married.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.501
No. I only said that
so you could googooety my geshmoigen.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.963
(laughs like
Woody Woodpecker)

15:24.216 --> 15:27.177
So, anyway, what I'm
trying to tell you is,

15:27.261 --> 15:30.264
some of the guys thought
we should get a divorce.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.932
What?!

15:32.015 --> 15:33.767
Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu--
But I told them

15:33.851 --> 15:35.102
they didn't know what
they were talking about.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.186
Good. Good.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.604
'Cause if you
ever left me,

15:37.688 --> 15:39.356
I'd have to cut myself.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.942
And then I'd cut you.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.944
I love you, Glenn.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.112
I love you, too,

15:45.195 --> 15:47.030
insane-woman-I'm-having-
second-thoughts-about.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.949
-What?
-All right.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.455
(whirring, hissing)

15:55.539 --> 15:57.124
Yes. Sleep away, woman.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.294
But I'm here to claim
what's rightfully mine.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.712
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.922
Oh, that's the stuff.
Yeah, yeah.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.967
(scream)

16:07.050 --> 16:09.303
Dear God! I've got to
get a hold of myself.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.514
Look at me...
sucking pilfered milk off a dirty carpet.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.267
I'm as pathetic
as the fat man when he tries to read.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.562
-Hey, Lois, what's this word?
-"Evel."

16:18.645 --> 16:19.813
-And this one?
-"Kneivel."

16:19.897 --> 16:20.898
-And this one?
-"Was."

16:20.981 --> 16:21.982
-And this one?
-"Born."

16:22.065 --> 16:23.108
-And this one?
-"In."

16:23.192 --> 16:24.818
-And this one?
-"Montana."

16:24.902 --> 16:27.654
Huh! Hey, Lois. Did you
know that Evel Kneivel

16:27.738 --> 16:29.281
was born in Montana?

16:32.743 --> 16:34.119
You didn't tell her?

16:34.203 --> 16:36.038
Look, I told you
she was gonna kill herself.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.206
What was I
supposed to do?

16:37.289 --> 16:40.626
Let her. Ha ha ah.
No, that's not funny.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.710
Wait a second.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.629
We know she's
gonna be upset if you dump her.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.048
But if something
happened that was out of your control--

16:46.131 --> 16:47.132
What do you mean?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.551
I mean we're gonna
fake your death.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.640
All right, fellas.
I think we did it.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.143
This may be
the most absolutely perfect fake death

16:58.227 --> 17:00.437
in the history
of fake deaths.

17:00.521 --> 17:01.563
(doorbell rings)

17:01.647 --> 17:02.814
What do you
guys want?

17:02.898 --> 17:05.400
Joan, um, you mind
if we come in?

17:05.484 --> 17:08.362
There's, um--
There's been an accident.

17:08.445 --> 17:11.365
This is, uh,
not gonna be easy,

17:11.448 --> 17:14.117
but it's something
you should see.

17:15.786 --> 17:16.787
PETER: So, anyway,
here's Quagmire

17:16.870 --> 17:18.163
walking through
the park,

17:18.247 --> 17:19.373
minding his
own business.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.792
I just happened
to be there with my video camera

17:21.875 --> 17:24.086
when a ninja shows up!

17:25.087 --> 17:27.256
And then a Nazi came!

17:28.298 --> 17:31.009
And then an evil
pots-and-pans robot!

17:31.093 --> 17:34.388
-(robotic voice) Destroy. Destroy.
-(beeping)

17:34.471 --> 17:36.056
I imagine you're
probably wondering

17:36.139 --> 17:37.266
what happened
to the body.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.433
Well, we thought
of that.

17:38.517 --> 17:41.812
PETER (on video):
Oh, no! Quagmire's dead!

17:41.895 --> 17:43.814
Wait! We might still
be able to save--

17:43.897 --> 17:44.982
Oh, no!

17:45.065 --> 17:51.071
(Peter sings
Jurassic Park music)

17:56.535 --> 18:00.038
We are so, so sorry
for your loss.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.206
Is this a joke?

18:01.290 --> 18:04.001
I wish it were, Joan.
I wish it were a joke.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.295
But these things
happen, you know?

18:06.378 --> 18:08.338
You go for a walk
in the park one day,

18:08.422 --> 18:09.965
and wheelchair
ninjas, and Nazis,

18:10.048 --> 18:12.092
and pots-and-pans
robots show up to kill you,

18:12.176 --> 18:13.677
and dinosaurs show up
to eat the remains.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.761
You've seen the news.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.555
You're not
fooling anyone.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.140
All right, fellows.
Plan B.

18:18.223 --> 18:19.224
Plan B, Quagmire.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.475
Hi, honey. I'm home.

18:20.559 --> 18:24.646
(screaming and moaning)
Heart attack!

18:24.730 --> 18:27.983
Glenn, sweetheart!
Is he all right?

18:28.066 --> 18:29.151
No, he's dead.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.277
I can tell.
I'm a cop.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.863
Oh, my God!
Are you sure?

18:32.946 --> 18:33.989
You know what'll
prove it?

18:34.072 --> 18:37.117
When people die,
they void their bowels.

18:37.201 --> 18:40.913
I said, when people die,
they void their bowels.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.583
GUYS:
Oh. Oh, my God! (laughing)

18:44.666 --> 18:46.168
PETER: What a jackass.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.589
Well, you look
a lot better.

18:50.672 --> 18:51.673
I did it, Brian!

18:51.924 --> 18:53.050
Through sheer
force of will

18:53.133 --> 18:54.843
I kicked my addiction
to breast milk.

18:54.927 --> 18:55.928
I just had to
find a way

18:56.011 --> 18:57.679
to make breasts
seem repulsive.

18:57.763 --> 18:58.764
Yeah? How'd you do that?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.265
I watched In The Cut.

19:00.349 --> 19:03.852
Meg Ryan topless.
No, thanks. No, thanks.

19:03.936 --> 19:07.105
Stewie, Mommy has
a surprise for you.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.190
What are you doing?

19:08.273 --> 19:10.317
Oh, Brian, I thought
I was ready to wean him.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.195
But I just miss
the bonding.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.365
No, no! No,
put me down! I beg of you!

19:16.448 --> 19:18.784
I just kicked
the stuff. Damn you!

19:18.867 --> 19:20.702
(moans)
You sick, twisted...

19:21.745 --> 19:23.539
I hate you.
(moans)

19:23.622 --> 19:25.374
I love it.
(moans)

19:25.457 --> 19:26.458
I will kill you!

19:26.542 --> 19:28.252
(moans)

19:32.965 --> 19:35.175
You sure Quagmire's
okay in there?

19:35.259 --> 19:37.469
No problem! He's got
half an hour of oxygen.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.388
We'll sneak back later
and dig him up.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.391
Sorry, I'm late.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.977
I had a meeting
over at NBC about Joey.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.063
Death? W-What
are you doing here? Nobody's dying today.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.857
Not according to
my paperwork.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.233
Says here your
buddy Quagmire

19:51.316 --> 19:52.651
died of a heart attack.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.735
I got to tell you,

19:53.944 --> 19:55.821
I always thought
it would be rectal trauma.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

20:00.492 --> 20:02.369
Well, Mayor West
is afraid of zombies.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.414
So the city says
all caskets must be encased in concrete.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.584
You'll thank me
when no one eats our brains.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.835
You'll thank me.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.044
Hold it! Stop
the funeral.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.838
Quagmire's not
really dead.

20:14.756 --> 20:15.757
(gasp for breath)

20:15.841 --> 20:17.009
Zombie!

20:17.092 --> 20:19.678
(screams)

20:19.761 --> 20:23.015
Glenn, I thought
I'd lost you.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.349
Sorry, Mr. Quagmire,

20:24.433 --> 20:26.518
but I still need
a body to take back with me. So...

20:26.602 --> 20:29.605
No, you can't take him!

20:32.774 --> 20:34.484
Uh, You know, um...

20:34.568 --> 20:35.986
this is probably
not cool.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.196
Just throwing
it out there.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.656
-She was suicidal.
-She was?

20:39.740 --> 20:41.658
-Yeah, absolutely.
-I have heard that, too.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.327
And her last name
was Quagmire.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.578
Well, good enough
for me.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.331
I got to go.
I got tickets to Celine Dion.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.498
I'm not gonna
kill her,

20:48.582 --> 20:50.667
I'm just gonna
watch her die on her own.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.420
Anyone? Anyone?

20:53.504 --> 20:55.672
Ah, it's good
to have you back, Quagmire.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.508
It's good to
be back, Peter.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.510
Hey, Uh, Death,

20:59.593 --> 21:01.678
can you leave that
body here for another five minutes?

21:01.762 --> 21:03.138
Ha ha ha ha ha.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.640
That's Quagmire.

21:04.723 --> 21:11.563
