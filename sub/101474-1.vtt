00:14.208 --> 00:17.583
DEMOLITION NOTICE

00:19.375 --> 00:23.042
WORKING TO BUILD A
BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE

00:33.792 --> 00:34.833
Help!

00:47.792 --> 00:49.875
Corner of 31st Street, we have something.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.000
Let's fight!

00:51.083 --> 00:52.208
Screw Nick Wright!

00:52.417 --> 00:53.583
We will fight!

00:53.750 --> 00:55.000
Screw Nick Wright!

00:55.250 --> 00:56.417
We will fight!

00:56.667 --> 00:57.792
Screw Nick Wright!

00:58.042 --> 00:59.208
We will fight!

00:59.292 --> 01:00.292
Screw it...

01:16.083 --> 01:17.917
Let's fight!  Screw Nick Wright!

01:18.167 --> 01:19.250
Let's fight!

01:19.333 --> 01:20.917
-Fuck it, you bloody pig!
-Damn Nick Wright!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.042
Let's fight!

01:22.125 --> 01:23.500
Screw Nick Wright!

01:23.708 --> 01:25.042
We will fight!

01:25.208 --> 01:26.250
Screw Nick Wright!

01:26.958 --> 01:28.333
Damn pig!

01:37.250 --> 01:38.500
Help!

01:39.708 --> 01:40.708
Help!

01:43.500 --> 01:44.583
Get away.

01:53.292 --> 01:55.750
-Get away! -Clean the way.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.500
-Get out of the way. -Skirt.

02:05.917 --> 02:06.917
Get out.

02:12.625 --> 02:15.125
TAKE HANDS FROM OUR HOUSES

03:01.917 --> 03:02.958
Let's do it level by level.

03:03.292 --> 03:04.625
It is probably a scam.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.500
It will be the third of this month.

04:25.417 --> 04:26.417
Hey!

04:39.333 --> 04:40.333
Excuse me.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.417
Do you all know you are
on private property?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.208
You should run, officer.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.083
While you still have a chance.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.500
You need to run
before they get here.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.917
Very late.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.875
I don't know what you think this is...

05:36.083 --> 05:37.125
Drop your weapon!

05:38.250 --> 05:39.417
This is your last chance!

05:41.208 --> 05:42.250
You...

05:43.500 --> 05:44.792
is not in charge here.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.167
-Hands on your head! -Sergeant.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Listen to me.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.500
For your own safety,

06:04.542 --> 06:05.542
put the gun away.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.875
Only in your dreams.

06:09.792 --> 06:12.708
On the contrary, I am wide awake.

06:26.917 --> 06:27.917
Listen.

06:28.792 --> 06:29.958
We have units on the way.

06:31.292 --> 06:32.333
You don't want to do this.

06:32.583 --> 06:33.833
He doesn't want to be a police killer.

06:39.042 --> 06:40.500
I was there, I did it.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.000
But young Dean here,

06:45.167 --> 06:48.083
well, let's say he had some
personal problems with you.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.125
Do not do it.

06:53.875 --> 06:54.875
Do not do it!

06:55.208 --> 06:56.208
Let the girl go!

07:13.083 --> 07:14.083
Look at me, Joanna.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.208
I didn't bring you here.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.917
You brought yourself here to
expel the rest of these people.

07:28.708 --> 07:29.708
My people.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.667
I have nothing to say about that.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.917
You have choices.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.375
You had choices and you
chose to support the rich.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.042
You and your people.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.833
You sleep in heated beds
and have hot showers.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.417
What about Bosque?

07:54.583 --> 07:55.583
What happens to us?

07:58.083 --> 07:59.542
I don't know, I don't know.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.500
Eviction notices arrive
a few days before Easter.

08:07.792 --> 08:09.417
I mean, this is sacrilege.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.792
After all, this is the western world.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.333
I was just doing my job.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.375
Well, you may not have
written the tax book,

08:18.458 --> 08:20.583
but you are carrying
on the devil's work.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.542
We were doing what is
best for this suburb.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.792
Don't compare me to a
simple-minded northerner, Jo.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.292
You are a private company,
strictly for profit,

08:28.417 --> 08:30.667
and wants nothing to do with what's best

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
for the community.

08:37.207 --> 08:40.417
You fell under the regime of
a man who was drunk on power.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.875
Are you a soldier

09:01.167 --> 09:02.208
by Nick Wright.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.083
And this week,

09:04.667 --> 09:06.958
Mr. Wright has publicly announced

09:07.542 --> 09:09.375
exactly what are your intentions

09:09.625 --> 09:11.375
for the Bosque Foundation.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.917
Follow the rules and do the
right thing for society,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.458
and most importantly,
contribute financially

09:16.542 --> 09:18.875
for the growth of the
community, so we have to see.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.500
Security and...

09:21.292 --> 09:22.292
Stop!

09:22.625 --> 09:24.000
-Stop! -I'm more than happy

09:24.125 --> 09:25.667
in sitting with some of these residents

09:26.083 --> 09:27.250
-No! -and establish plans

09:27.333 --> 09:28.375
that we have for the future.

09:28.458 --> 09:31.292
As you can see,
Mr. Wright intends to light a flame

09:31.417 --> 09:32.583
-in our community, Jo.
-Tell me Nick,

09:32.708 --> 09:35.125
what will happen in a year?
These tenants will be...

09:35.250 --> 09:36.500
So I think it's just...

09:36.792 --> 09:37.875
This will continue to be seen.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.708
Light our own flame.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.500
If they want to obey and do good...

09:41.583 --> 09:43.417
-No! -The most important is

09:43.500 --> 09:45.542
the financial contribution
to community growth...

09:45.625 --> 09:47.208
Please stop!

09:47.292 --> 09:50.417
Security and a comfortable
environment to live.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.958
DEMOLITION NOTICE

10:53.000 --> 10:56.833
WILL CHIP

10:59.500 --> 11:02.708
DIE

11:38.417 --> 11:42.625
WELCOME TO THE NEW RUA DO BOSQUE

11:42.708 --> 11:48.750
THE FOREST WON'T GIVE IN

11:51.625 --> 11:56.958
GANG A NIGHT OF TERROR

12:06.958 --> 12:09.583
I need to emphasize that
this was not a decision

12:09.708 --> 12:10.708
easily achieved.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.625
The community and its future,

12:12.708 --> 12:14.958
and the future of everyone in the northern suburbs

12:15.083 --> 12:17.375
that's what led us to the
decision to end the houses.

12:17.958 --> 12:21.167
We need to reduce
crime, reduce violence.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.208
This will make the Rua do Bosque
project ideal for families.

12:25.625 --> 12:26.917
Today's struggles,

12:27.958 --> 12:28.958
tomorrow will be harmony.

12:29.292 --> 12:31.833
That was the CEO and managing
director, Nick Wright,

12:31.958 --> 12:33.792
talking about the Rua do Bosque project.

12:34.208 --> 12:38.000
While many support the venture,
petitions and protests have not stopped...

12:40.292 --> 12:41.500
Did the story finally air?

12:42.833 --> 12:43.833
Yes.

12:44.042 --> 12:46.042
Nick didn't really give a
touch of sympathy to that.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.292
And we put the paperwork on this table
this morning before the interview.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.333
I thought I could save
your image a little bit.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.000
Yes, maybe a little.

12:59.917 --> 13:00.917
Do you have something in mind?

13:04.875 --> 13:07.917
You are not the one who answers people
saying that we are ruining lives.

13:08.417 --> 13:09.417
This is the job.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.125
You almost looked a little
like Nick at that moment.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.792
I'm so sorry.

13:33.792 --> 13:34.792
He rejected it.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.542
Shocked.

13:40.792 --> 13:41.875
I didn't even see it coming.

13:43.958 --> 13:44.958
Very well.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.208
You got fired, didn't you?

13:46.667 --> 13:47.667
Shut up.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.167
I told you, it was a waste of time.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.750
Nobody asked you for your time or opinion.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.167
You are just a girl.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.875
A talented girl

13:56.708 --> 13:59.000
who wastes time
chasing dead ends.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.000
That is just my opinion.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.833
In my opinion,
you are a selfish piece of shit.

14:08.750 --> 14:09.833
Let's have coffee.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Erin?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.958
I'm going to have a latte, thanks.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.500
Tony?  You got it.  Yes!

14:19.750 --> 14:22.167
The speech you wrote was
beautiful, perfectly planned.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.583
When everything was said and done,
they were eating from my hand.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.542
Yes, Marissa, Tony?  Tony, Marissa.

14:30.125 --> 14:33.375
By the way, take care of the stupid journalist
on Thursday, I don't want him there, right?

14:34.250 --> 14:35.333
Very well, you know him.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.208
Okay, I have to go.  Goodbye.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.417
His interview was on point.

14:41.792 --> 14:43.250
- Did you watch it back?
-I made.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.750
You didn't mention the tenants.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.417
I didn't want to draw attention to them.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.292
The attention is already on them.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.542
Insignificant.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.667
It is not, we poured 45 units.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.708
Bosque's days were long over.
The public knows this.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.625
But, the only thing the
public can see is that we did

14:59.750 --> 15:01.208
all those families become homeless.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.042
Well, let the public complain

15:03.167 --> 15:05.333
when in a year,
they have a safe place to live.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.167
I have no sympathy for that
northern suburban scum.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.375
Good.

15:14.625 --> 15:15.792
What's going on with you today?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.500
-What you mean?
-Well, you were on board.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.417
As soon as we pull the trigger,
you come with that coldness.

15:21.958 --> 15:23.667
Since when does public
opinion touch you?

15:24.125 --> 15:25.667
I don't see coldness, I just...

15:27.583 --> 15:29.708
I didn't think the evictions
would happen so quickly.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.917
Look, maybe we could have
provided temporary housing.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.000
The only way to get out of the
red is to stay within budget.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.500
Pay the rent for the 45 units

15:37.625 --> 15:39.000
can compromise the entire
business structure.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.500
So we should have postponed it,

15:41.167 --> 15:42.333
and with due notification.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.708
Stop letting Nathan and
Erin get into your head.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.625
If we do that,
half the office will be out of a job.

15:46.708 --> 15:50.583
If it's up to us to choose,
and those damn shit parasites,

15:50.917 --> 15:53.625
these four walls come
first, understand?

15:54.333 --> 15:55.333
Great way to say.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.500
Morality is well camouflaged out there.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.333
Well,
they have a four-day weekend.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.417
A little overtime
won't kill anyone.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.083
And who is this?

16:54.458 --> 16:55.500
Josh Scott.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.290
Good afternoon, Mr. Scott.

17:12.750 --> 17:13.790
Because you...

17:15.250 --> 17:16.250
don't spend a little time

17:18.750 --> 17:19.750
looking around?

17:26.083 --> 17:28.415
And you can see exactly

17:30.333 --> 17:31.375
what did you do?

17:31.458 --> 17:33.792
I can reimburse you, I can.
I swear I will pay you!

17:34.208 --> 17:35.583
I promise, I'll pay whatever you want!

17:37.292 --> 17:41.042
Balance money in front of people who
are looking for shelter, don't you?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.583
People whose entire lives

17:49.792 --> 17:51.292
fit inside your backpacks.

17:51.792 --> 17:53.833
I'm just an employee!
I'm like a worm!

17:54.083 --> 17:55.083
That's all I am!

17:55.875 --> 17:57.625
You are a slave.

18:00.083 --> 18:03.083
From a man with a highly
profitable initiative.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.000
And that man

18:07.958 --> 18:10.208
will get what it deserves
because of this initiative

18:12.375 --> 18:13.917
about a small community,

18:15.833 --> 18:17.208
from the back of the forest.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.917
I want you to watch this.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.958
Because I don't want anyone
to take anything from you

18:41.042 --> 18:43.583
if you don't fully understand
all the consequences

18:44.708 --> 18:45.875
of your actions, right?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.000
Do you want to leave a message?

19:08.958 --> 19:10.958
Another satisfied customer.

19:11.792 --> 19:12.792
That's what you're saying.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.625
Well, you haven't lost much,
it's a ghost town out there.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.250
It's a long weekend.

19:17.792 --> 19:19.583
Yes, but nobody gave Nick the
memo, so...

19:20.250 --> 19:22.042
Yes,
I heard you were running late.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.208
Yes.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.500
It's worse, much worse.

19:26.167 --> 19:27.500
Nate whimpering again.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.708
Jesus Christ.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.375
Don't you have a crime to deal
with, a missing stapler?

19:33.458 --> 19:36.208
Or not, wait, did you know that Erin used
two packs of paper yesterday afternoon?

19:36.583 --> 19:38.917
-Lock it and throw away the key.
-I used.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.292
Speaking of misdemeanor,
I was looking at your browser history.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.792
Entries for "Disney on Ice"?
You know you should be working.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.292
They're for my niece.  Okay, just...

19:50.125 --> 19:52.250
Okay, come on.
I have a lot to do.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.500
Just avoid Brian, will you?

19:54.917 --> 19:56.333
God.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.333
You will get them,
tiger, I believe you.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.792
Find my stapler.

20:00.417 --> 20:01.417
The pink.

20:01.917 --> 20:02.917
It's all right.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.083
Hey. You still haven't given
me any feedback on Sunday.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.917
-What? It's just brunch.
-Good...

20:11.583 --> 20:14.125
No, it's only a brunch after
the 14-hour night shift.

20:14.417 --> 20:15.417
Good...

20:16.125 --> 20:18.000
My mom is only in
town for a few days.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.125
Let's go.

20:20.542 --> 20:21.583
You'll be fine.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.792
Good.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.583
Oh, come on, man!

20:27.667 --> 20:29.125
-Let's go!
-Did you see the replay?

20:30.792 --> 20:32.583
Yes. That's it, yes!

20:33.083 --> 20:34.333
Kick, kick, get them.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.708
Man, that was almost,
it almost came.

20:37.792 --> 20:40.208
-We are almost there.
-Is this really productive?

20:41.208 --> 20:42.208
It is a great game.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.667
-You can't be multitasking?
-We're waiting for Josh.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.750
Well, he should have been back by now.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.083
Of course not.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.542
-Watch it, check it out, check this out.
-Too much.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.375
You came back.

21:35.417 --> 21:37.042
Has this family ever
talked to each other?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.083
Well, you know your mother.

21:41.833 --> 21:42.833
She misses you.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.542
I miss her too.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.125
So I didn't realize
that you would be on TV.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.958
I had to explain the project.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.250
But,

22:01.792 --> 22:05.125
I bet that leaving people homeless
would have caused a bit of negativity.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.292
Tell me how you really
feel, Laura.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.167
You didn't even look sorry, Dad.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.458
Would it have hurt to just
show a little empathy?

22:14.375 --> 22:15.375
By whom?

22:15.875 --> 22:18.000
People who suck government resources?

22:18.250 --> 22:20.875
No effort to make a change
or create a safe place?

22:21.375 --> 22:23.500
What about children growing up
in that kind of environment?

22:24.833 --> 22:26.042
Well, what about them now?

22:28.167 --> 22:29.708
It's the same old story with you, isn't it?

22:30.375 --> 22:33.417
A few semesters inside, and you just
want to sit and judge the world.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.500
I am judging only you now, father.

22:40.667 --> 22:41.792
So is that why you came here?

22:44.167 --> 22:45.625
Couldn't you wait
until I got home?

22:45.958 --> 22:47.000
I took the car.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.667
My mom comes to get you.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.250
Good...

22:56.875 --> 22:58.167
You will just have to hold on tight.

22:58.458 --> 23:01.125
That is, if you can bear the
torture of being in my presence.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.875
In this case, we split into two teams.

23:40.042 --> 23:42.833
It's all about licenses and
forms for the next few months.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.333
We promised the public a semester to
recover expenses at Rua do Bosque.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.667
Expense reports need to
be strictly monitored.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.625
The financing will be released in
parts, so we need to split the expenses.

23:51.833 --> 23:54.333
I will need reports from each
department head later in the evening.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.792
Right.  Nathan, you and...

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
Where's Harry?

24:23.375 --> 24:24.417
Can I help you?

24:52.833 --> 24:54.333
Shit, no!

25:39.292 --> 25:40.333
Is ready?

25:56.375 --> 25:57.417
Someone!

25:58.583 --> 25:59.625
Someone!

26:05.667 --> 26:08.583
Erin, I hate to do this,
but I need it to be public relations.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.417
See if you can make a
positive impression.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.333
Any idea how I can do this?

26:12.417 --> 26:14.542
Until I have an idea,
I'm going down the slope.

26:14.792 --> 26:15.792
You will find out.

26:15.917 --> 26:16.917
You always do.

26:17.917 --> 26:21.500
It's all right. Tom and Brian,
as always, will be with Josh.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.917
Speaking of which,
do any of you know where he is?

26:24.417 --> 26:27.708
I spoke to him about an hour ago,
and said he was coming back, but...

26:28.250 --> 26:30.708
I haven't heard any more,
say, for the last half hour.

26:31.292 --> 26:33.500
-What about you guys?
-Yes, I don't either.

26:34.167 --> 26:35.167
What the hell is this?

26:50.583 --> 26:51.792
Who broke the lock on the gate?

26:52.500 --> 26:53.500
What's wrong with her?

26:53.917 --> 26:54.958
It's stuck.

27:00.167 --> 27:02.458
-What happened?
-Someone broke the lock on the gate.

27:03.958 --> 27:04.958
What were you doing locked up?

27:05.542 --> 27:06.542
I thought it was you.

27:08.083 --> 27:10.583
Tommy, could you go down to the
basement, get the pliers?

28:06.250 --> 28:07.500
Guess what Tom just said?

28:10.958 --> 28:12.125
Land for Jason.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.167
This from the lock seems intentional.

28:17.833 --> 28:18.833
What?

29:54.917 --> 29:56.333
It’s not very orthodox,

29:56.542 --> 29:59.250
and it will not be extremely
comfortable, but it already covers.

29:59.917 --> 30:01.000
Nick won't do that.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.458
You don't know that.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.792
How much will it cost?

30:08.125 --> 30:10.958
I swear,
Nick sent me on a wild chase.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.625
He wants me to find a way for public
relations to get around everything,

30:13.708 --> 30:14.708
but I can't do...

30:15.083 --> 30:16.125
Sorry for interrupting.

30:16.917 --> 30:18.542
-What's it? - Can we talk alone?

30:20.042 --> 30:21.042
Of course.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.125
I will keep working on it.

30:29.125 --> 30:31.208
They locked the gate,
but all the cars are still inside.

30:31.875 --> 30:33.958
-And? - Someone locked us up.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.708
There is a suspicious van in the parking lot,
and I found traces of blood on the floor.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.375
Before I think I'm crazy,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.917
I've been reading The Herald
posts for the past hour.

30:44.792 --> 30:45.875
Check out the comments.

30:48.042 --> 30:49.042
Are you worried?

30:50.125 --> 30:52.417
They are signed by
a group called TKG.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.208
I have done some research on them.

30:56.375 --> 30:59.625
They've been inactive for the past ten years,
but from what I've read, it's bad news.

31:12.208 --> 31:13.542
-Did you see that? -I saw.

31:14.083 --> 31:15.083
And then?

31:15.708 --> 31:16.750
Keyboard militancy.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.417
Every time we propose something,
we repeat it on social media

31:19.958 --> 31:21.333
These are threats, Nick.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.833
We can't just ignore it,
we have to do something.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.708
"Ivory towers fall."

31:27.875 --> 31:29.042
"Rest in peace."

31:29.208 --> 31:31.125
"TKGs are coming."

31:34.333 --> 31:35.458
Keyboard militancy?

31:36.917 --> 31:39.458
-Dad? -Just people
with the screws loose

31:39.542 --> 31:42.250
-posted on a forum. -There are
more than 20 if you keep reading,

31:42.375 --> 31:43.708
and all are signed by TKG.

31:43.875 --> 31:44.875
And who are they?

31:45.750 --> 31:47.708
-A group from the northern suburbs.
-I never heard of them.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.542
-Of course they heard about us. -Come
on Marissa, what are they going to do?

31:56.417 --> 31:57.458
This is normal?

31:58.292 --> 31:59.292
Do not.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.625
Is not it.

32:07.917 --> 32:09.583
-What happened to the force?
-I dont know.

32:09.917 --> 32:12.042
-And can you fix it?
-I'm not an electrician.

32:12.833 --> 32:13.958
Check the circuit breakers.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.500
What's going on with the force?

32:20.167 --> 32:22.625
I just lost about
45 minutes of work.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.375
What do we do?

32:26.625 --> 32:28.667
I'm going to ask you to go
check the gate situation.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.958
Nate, can I ask you to
check the circuit breakers?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.083
I don't know what they are,
let alone where they are.

32:43.917 --> 32:44.917
I do.

32:45.417 --> 32:46.417
I will take a look.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.167
Thanks.

32:53.625 --> 32:54.708
Where is everyone?

33:34.667 --> 33:35.708
Tone?

33:55.708 --> 33:57.000
What the fuck?

34:07.542 --> 34:08.833
-But how? -Calm.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.542
What are you doing?

34:13.417 --> 34:14.500
You worried me.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.292
I think I worried.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.333
About what?

34:25.750 --> 34:27.208
Can we reach that gate?

34:30.417 --> 34:32.292
ELECTRIC BREAKER BOX

35:24.792 --> 35:25.792
What's wrong with her?

35:26.375 --> 35:27.375
Where is everyone?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Tom is dead.

35:31.042 --> 35:32.750
Wait, did you say "dead"?

36:17.917 --> 36:20.125
Come on guys!
What the hell is going on here?

36:23.333 --> 36:24.333
We are under attack.

36:25.667 --> 36:26.833
There is someone in the building.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.208
Now,
I need to know who is missing.

36:34.458 --> 36:35.458
Erin.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.167
Let's go!

37:46.625 --> 37:47.625
What happened?

37:47.708 --> 37:48.708
Two of them.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.125
Upstairs.

37:50.667 --> 37:51.792
Locked in the file room.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.833
We need to ask for help.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.458
The signals appear to have been blocked.

37:59.333 --> 38:00.708
How is this possible?

38:03.250 --> 38:05.125
What about online?
Send a distress call?

38:05.583 --> 38:06.583
Do not.

38:07.542 --> 38:10.667
The routers have shut down
since the power went out.

38:11.042 --> 38:12.042
Shit.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.458
This was well thought out.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.375
The gate is locked.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
Router turned off.

38:22.417 --> 38:23.458
The signal is stuck.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.250
They left us as easy targets.

38:28.792 --> 38:29.792
Who has?

38:31.292 --> 38:32.292
TKG.

38:33.208 --> 38:34.208
Right.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.250
Are you sure it's them?

38:36.875 --> 38:37.875
Yes.

38:48.542 --> 38:50.083
Okay, if they're locked up there,

38:50.208 --> 38:52.583
Let's go out. We find the nearest
location and we will get the authorities.

38:53.625 --> 38:54.667
How are we going to get out?

39:03.625 --> 39:04.625
We knock on the gate.

39:05.708 --> 39:06.708
Yes.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.333
All right, come on.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.250
We don't know how many
more of them are out there.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.250
I should explore first

39:15.042 --> 39:16.208
and make sure it’s clean.

39:17.292 --> 39:19.708
After opening the gate,
I will come back to you.

39:20.750 --> 39:21.750
Okay, good idea.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.125
And what happens if you find one?

39:25.542 --> 39:26.542
What will you do?

39:28.792 --> 39:29.792
I will find out.

39:31.458 --> 39:32.458
You will find out?

39:39.625 --> 39:41.208
-Well, then, I'm going with you.
-No.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.083
She is right.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.458
You shouldn't go alone.

39:47.542 --> 39:48.542
Brian, go with him.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.375
Because I?

39:53.833 --> 39:54.833
Why not you?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.292
Hey.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.167
-Be careful. -I'll be fine.

40:21.333 --> 40:22.417
You came after me.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.208
What was I going to do?

40:24.833 --> 40:25.833
Run for the hills?

40:27.083 --> 40:28.958
I would run.  I know.

40:29.208 --> 40:30.917
I think instincts come
into play quickly.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.208
We need to think of a plan.

40:43.333 --> 40:44.333
The intercom.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.083
My office.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.500
Jason?

40:54.167 --> 40:56.292
Good night, Mr. Wright.

40:56.458 --> 40:57.458
Who is it?

40:59.208 --> 41:01.125
Well, if you were a man of your word,

41:01.875 --> 41:03.083
you would know who this is.

41:04.875 --> 41:05.917
A man of my word?

41:10.167 --> 41:12.583
I understand the position of
those in the northern suburbs,

41:12.667 --> 41:14.875
and especially in the
houses on Rua do Bosque.

41:15.292 --> 41:17.542
I am more than happy to sit down
with some of these residents

41:17.625 --> 41:20.500
and outline the plans that we
have for them in the future,

41:20.583 --> 41:22.708
and how it will benefit
them in the long run.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.708
In a way, we never had our formal
meeting, Mr. Wright.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.000
So, I thought we could

41:31.500 --> 41:33.250
have an informal conversation.

41:38.208 --> 41:39.250
What you want?

41:39.333 --> 41:40.625
Housing, money?

41:41.208 --> 41:42.250
Blood.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.708
Yours, specifically.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.208
You should know that the police are coming.

42:00.292 --> 42:02.917
That was as convincing
as you tell the world

42:02.958 --> 42:04.958
that your project was going to be a benefit

42:05.792 --> 42:06.792
for the community.

42:11.417 --> 42:13.292
I want you to know something, Mr. Wright.

42:16.333 --> 42:17.375
I want you to know,

42:20.042 --> 42:21.042
that you will die.

42:22.625 --> 42:23.625
Tonight.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.417
Together with your entire team.

42:29.875 --> 42:30.917
I want you to know,

42:32.750 --> 42:34.583
I will be the man who will kill you.

42:38.583 --> 42:40.958
Starting with your
improvised security guard.

42:45.875 --> 42:47.208
What line did this call come from?

42:47.583 --> 42:48.583
107.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.708
The security office.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.333
Damn, we have to warn the guys.

43:00.833 --> 43:02.917
-And then?
-Come on, we need a new plan.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.000
What are you doing
running down here?

43:30.250 --> 43:31.500
I just saw Tom's body.

43:32.875 --> 43:34.417
I can't let that happen to him.

43:38.208 --> 43:40.125
Look, Jase can take care of herself.

43:41.292 --> 43:42.375
We have to warn you.

44:12.208 --> 44:13.333
What are you doing down here?

44:13.708 --> 44:16.042
These guys are not kidding,
they are watching us.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.167
Stay out of sight.

44:23.083 --> 44:24.458
Why haven't you
fixed the gate yet?

44:25.208 --> 44:26.792
Looks like they took out the batteries.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.917
My car isn't going anywhere,
and neither is Jase's.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.417
Where's Jason?

44:39.875 --> 44:40.875
What are you doing down here?

44:42.042 --> 44:44.125
- We came to warn you.
-It's not safe here.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.667
I don't care, a guy is coming...

44:45.750 --> 44:47.625
And now you're here,
where I didn't want you to come.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
What is the plan?

44:52.583 --> 44:55.167
The gate will only move if I
have a sledgehammer or something.

44:56.625 --> 44:58.250
But maybe we can get
you through the fence,

44:58.750 --> 44:59.750
then you can run through it.

45:00.458 --> 45:02.125
There's a service station on Bulwer Street.

45:02.958 --> 45:04.792
No, it's too far on foot.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.583
I would go, but I need to stay until
I find a safe way to get them out.

45:15.792 --> 45:17.042
Yes OK.

45:32.792 --> 45:34.875
Damn it, man.  I don't know anything about it.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.083
Me neither.

45:37.542 --> 45:39.292
It's too tight for me to go there.

45:40.667 --> 45:41.667
Just try.

45:45.167 --> 45:46.167
What shit!

45:48.708 --> 45:49.708
Saw?  Easy.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.500
Yes, come and join me, man.

45:52.042 --> 45:53.375
All right, Bulwer Street, go.

45:54.375 --> 45:55.375
All right.

45:55.958 --> 45:57.750
Katie, go with Brian and be safe.

45:58.792 --> 45:59.792
Hang on.

46:00.458 --> 46:01.458
Which way?

46:01.542 --> 46:03.583
-Fuck! Come on -My God, Jason!

46:04.000 --> 46:05.292
-What the fuck was that?
-A shot!

46:05.458 --> 46:06.458
Get down!

46:06.958 --> 46:08.542
Get down!  It's all right!

46:08.833 --> 46:09.833
They shot him!

46:13.167 --> 46:14.625
We need to go back inside.  Let's go!

46:15.792 --> 46:17.500
- Has anyone been hit?
-I can not see!

46:26.458 --> 46:27.500
We need to go back inside.

46:29.292 --> 46:30.333
We need to be careful.

46:43.667 --> 46:44.667
Let's go.

46:45.542 --> 46:46.583
Let's go.

47:05.583 --> 47:06.625
Come on.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.125
Let's go.

47:12.375 --> 47:13.375
Come on.

47:41.875 --> 47:43.167
-Jason! -Katie!

47:43.708 --> 47:44.708
Jason!

49:13.125 --> 49:14.125
Already is!

49:19.917 --> 49:20.917
Riss!

49:21.750 --> 49:22.750
Riss!

49:24.375 --> 49:25.417
Boys!

49:26.917 --> 49:27.917
Nate!

49:28.083 --> 49:29.500
Help him, please!
He's losing blood.

49:29.625 --> 49:31.917
-Put it in Nick's office!
-It's ok.

49:40.667 --> 49:41.958
-Calm down. -Shit!

49:42.250 --> 49:43.250
Put it on the couch.

49:43.875 --> 49:45.792
Take it, sit down.  Sit it down.

49:45.917 --> 49:47.417
God, we have to stop his bleeding.

49:47.792 --> 49:48.792
Calm.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.708
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-Put it down here!

49:50.917 --> 49:53.042
-Hold it! -I'm sorry, Jase!

49:56.250 --> 49:57.708
Okay, I'm fine.

49:58.417 --> 50:00.042
-You are not well. -All right.

50:07.208 --> 50:08.417
-Well, okay. -Watch out.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.542
-Ready? -Fuck!

50:09.958 --> 50:10.958
No two.

50:45.958 --> 50:47.833
-Are you holding on?
-What are you doing?

50:48.917 --> 50:50.208
Finding the way to the sniper.

50:51.583 --> 50:52.625
What?

50:53.333 --> 50:54.833
I'm trying to see where
he got access from.

50:57.292 --> 50:59.042
You are crazy?
What do you need to know that for?

50:59.417 --> 51:00.750
All you need to know
is that there is one.

51:01.167 --> 51:04.042
Look, the only way out is
through the front gate. Right?

51:04.125 --> 51:06.667
From where he is, he can keep an eye
on us and shoot from any exit point.

51:07.375 --> 51:08.833
Then what you will do?

51:09.833 --> 51:10.875
We need to get him out of there.

51:12.917 --> 51:14.792
Excuse me?  What do we need?

51:14.875 --> 51:15.875
Did you hear me.

51:16.167 --> 51:17.208
This is ridiculous.

51:17.708 --> 51:18.917
Okay, what's your plan?

51:18.958 --> 51:20.292
-I don't appreciate your...
-Nick...

51:20.417 --> 51:22.500
right now, I don't give a damn
what you appreciate, okay?

51:22.667 --> 51:23.667
We did that.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.208
No thought or care was
taken in the execution

51:25.292 --> 51:26.708
and now we're stuck in the middle of it.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.625
How could I have known it would be like this?

51:28.958 --> 51:30.583
Tell them what they told
us on the zoning committee.

51:33.375 --> 51:34.417
It was a rumor.

51:35.875 --> 51:36.875
What did you say?

51:40.250 --> 51:43.042
These are the northern suburbs,
of course there would be threats.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.542
-When were you going to tell us about it?
- It wasn't relevant.

51:45.667 --> 51:47.750
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Would you have stepped back?

51:48.875 --> 51:50.667
Listen,
I'm pretty sure we can...

51:50.750 --> 51:52.208
we can all just wait seated.

51:52.292 --> 51:53.792
We have friends and family,

51:53.875 --> 51:55.792
who will be concerned when
they don't hear from us.

51:56.792 --> 51:57.875
I'm sure that

51:58.167 --> 52:00.208
we all told someone who
was waiting for us tonight

52:00.292 --> 52:01.417
that we would work late.

52:04.250 --> 52:05.375
Just stop.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.542
Don't hide now, Nick.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.125
People are dead.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.333
We are not going to play with politics.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.542
I'm with Marissa.

52:47.917 --> 52:49.500
Any action is better than no action.

52:53.875 --> 52:54.917
On here.

52:56.083 --> 52:57.083
EVACUATION DIAGRAM
-The fourth floor.

52:57.750 --> 52:58.750
The fourth floor?

52:59.375 --> 53:00.958
That's how he got on the roof.

53:03.417 --> 53:04.792
It is the only access point.

53:07.625 --> 53:08.750
We can try to attract you.

53:09.042 --> 53:10.042
The shooter?

53:10.583 --> 53:12.458
Does everyone here
agree with this plan?

53:13.083 --> 53:14.083
We lure you out.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.792
Maybe some of us can
get through the gate.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.542
Who will attract you?

53:20.583 --> 53:21.625
Are you hurt.

53:22.083 --> 53:23.125
Wounded, not killed.

53:24.292 --> 53:25.333
You can't move with that.

53:25.917 --> 53:28.083
Even if you get up there,
you will be an easy target.

53:29.375 --> 53:30.417
What options do we have?

53:30.500 --> 53:32.417
How about a room full of people
who haven't been stabbed?

53:32.500 --> 53:33.750
What do you think of this option?

54:03.500 --> 54:04.625
Help!

54:05.083 --> 54:06.083
Someone!

54:06.375 --> 54:09.708
Nick, you put us here.
I don't see you volunteering.

54:09.917 --> 54:13.542
The problem is out there.
Can we stop trying to create one here?

54:13.625 --> 54:14.958
No, the problem is that he is injured,

54:15.208 --> 54:17.292
and everyone seems happy sending it to...

54:17.417 --> 54:18.750
Nobody is sending me anywhere!

54:34.167 --> 54:35.208
Help!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.417
You have to stop worrying about me.
Let me do that.

54:41.042 --> 54:43.125
None of the other guys
are able to do so.

54:43.333 --> 54:44.958
And you are?  That simple?

54:45.500 --> 54:47.875
Jase, you are even
struggling to talk to me.

54:48.500 --> 54:51.000
What are you trying to prove by
going out there and doing this?

54:55.292 --> 54:56.333
I'm doing this for you.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.542
Because if something happens to
you and I didn't do anything,

54:59.875 --> 55:00.917
so this is on me.

55:03.083 --> 55:04.542
So please, stop pressing me.

55:05.208 --> 55:06.208
I will do this.

55:07.958 --> 55:08.958
Right.

55:15.667 --> 55:17.625
Even if we arrest them,
we don't know how many more there are.

55:25.417 --> 55:26.667
Erin, can you see if Laura is okay?

55:30.708 --> 55:31.708
Yes.

55:39.375 --> 55:40.375
Okay, what's the plan?

55:43.042 --> 55:44.417
Guys, help!

55:44.708 --> 55:45.708
Help!

55:46.125 --> 55:47.583
-Laura! -Help!

55:50.958 --> 55:51.958
Laura, are you okay?

55:52.083 --> 55:53.500
Oh shit, she's not breathing!

55:53.625 --> 55:54.917
Help here!  Help her!

55:55.250 --> 55:56.833
Shit!

55:57.250 --> 55:59.333
-Wake up, come on!
-Laura, hold on!

55:59.750 --> 56:00.958
-Laura? -Breathe!

56:01.125 --> 56:02.625
Breathe!

56:02.708 --> 56:04.417
-It's all right.
-Make her breathe!

56:04.500 --> 56:06.167
Make her breathe!

56:06.750 --> 56:07.750
Make her breathe!

56:08.167 --> 56:09.875
Breathe, baby, please!  Breathe!

56:10.125 --> 56:12.625
Knife!  Come on, breathe!

56:12.958 --> 56:15.125
Breathe, come on, breathe, baby!

56:15.250 --> 56:16.292
Breathe, please!

56:16.750 --> 56:18.917
Breathe, breathe, God!

56:20.083 --> 56:22.917
-Breathe!
Go faster, come on! -I'm!

56:23.083 --> 56:24.833
Faster, make her breathe!

56:25.125 --> 56:27.458
Please breathe!

56:28.125 --> 56:29.167
No!

56:29.458 --> 56:31.750
No!

56:32.042 --> 56:33.083
No!

56:33.208 --> 56:35.625
Breathe, baby!  Do not.

56:38.875 --> 56:39.875
It's all right!

56:40.292 --> 56:41.292
It's okay, Laura!

56:41.500 --> 56:42.750
Laura!

56:43.292 --> 56:45.500
Laura!

56:58.083 --> 56:59.083
Laura!

56:59.833 --> 57:02.000
Laura, I'm sorry!

57:02.417 --> 57:03.667
I'm so sorry!

57:04.000 --> 57:05.792
I'm so sorry!

57:06.375 --> 57:08.333
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

57:09.292 --> 57:10.292
Guys, they're up here.

57:26.083 --> 57:27.083
Stand up.

57:28.375 --> 57:29.375
Nathan.

57:29.500 --> 57:30.500
Nathan, take Laura.

57:30.625 --> 57:33.250
-Take it and lock up in my office.
- Wait a minute, what?

57:33.708 --> 57:34.708
No dad!

57:35.417 --> 57:37.042
Go ahead, take it, take it!

57:37.167 --> 57:38.500
-Go! -Hang on!

57:39.750 --> 57:41.958
Somebody bring me a gun!

57:42.750 --> 57:44.167
Fuck!  Take her!

57:52.208 --> 57:53.250
Help...

58:04.792 --> 58:05.792
Katie?

58:13.708 --> 58:14.708
Katie!

58:18.333 --> 58:19.375
No!

58:20.375 --> 58:21.417
Baby, just breathe!

58:22.083 --> 58:23.083
Relax.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.125
Fuck, she's losing blood.

58:29.292 --> 58:30.292
Help!

58:31.500 --> 58:33.125
Help me, I'm dying!

58:33.208 --> 58:35.208
-Come on, hold on. -I'm dying!

58:37.625 --> 58:38.625
Katie!

58:44.708 --> 58:45.708
Wait a second!

58:47.417 --> 58:48.458
What do we do?

58:48.583 --> 58:49.583
Help her!

58:50.333 --> 58:51.458
It's all right...

58:51.708 --> 58:52.792
Katie, it's okay.

58:52.958 --> 58:54.417
-Katie, wait. -It's all right.

58:54.500 --> 58:56.000
-I do not want to die!
-It's all right.

58:56.292 --> 58:57.333
Wait, Katie.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
It's ok.

59:08.167 --> 59:09.250
Go help Jase.

59:14.042 --> 59:15.625
Katie!

59:16.375 --> 59:18.500
- Damn it, hold on.
Resist, Katie! -Please.

59:19.500 --> 59:20.625
We need to stop this bleeding!

59:21.833 --> 59:24.333
Let's go!  Don't just sit there!

59:24.583 --> 59:26.500
-Nate, help her!
-I can't, it's too late.

59:27.625 --> 59:29.458
Katie, come on!

59:30.750 --> 59:32.500
No, someone does something!

59:32.958 --> 59:33.958
No...

59:36.917 --> 59:37.958
It's all right...

59:39.583 --> 59:40.583
It's ok...

59:43.167 --> 59:45.208
-I'm so sorry! -It's ok.

59:49.833 --> 59:51.542
-Katie? -Stop...

59:52.208 --> 59:53.208
No...

59:54.542 --> 59:56.208
Katie?

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:02.958
Katie?  No...

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:04.875
Katie?

01:00:05.042 --> 01:00:06.042
Katie?

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:09.125
Katie?

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:07.000
-For! -Fuck it, Nick!

01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:08.583
No!

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:09.958
What are you doing?

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:12.125
-Leave me.
-No, she's just a girl!

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.042
She's gone.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:20.042
What the fuck.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:21.917
Damn it!

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.542
Damn it.

01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:29.042
-Let me... -No.
She can give us information.

01:01:57.542 --> 01:01:59.083
You are a disgrace.

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:03.042
How many of you are in the building?

01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:07.542
We have an army waiting
outside for you.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.125
-Already is! -If you don't like
it, Nick, get out of here.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.708
And you are only useful to me if you speak.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.750
If it were up to me,
you wouldn't be breathing right now.

01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:22.792
Corporate fools pretending to be tough.

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:26.125
Have you ever stabbed someone in
the heart and watched them die?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.500
I have.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:29.833
Don't let it get in your head.

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:34.208
Stop, go outside and cool off!

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.292
Fuck it!

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:37.917
I know you're upset, but we have
to get everyone out of here safely.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.500
Look at me.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.792
You are warriors, right?

01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:38.750
Survivors?

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:41.708
Do what it takes to live?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500
Understand.

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:49.250
Now I don't know how
many of you came here,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.333
but you will notice that it is one less.

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.625
That's what happens when my
survival instinct kicks in.

01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.625
I may not have stabbed
someone in the heart,

01:04:06.917 --> 01:04:08.542
but I already did it in the throat.

01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:12.833
So tell me...

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:16.083
do you want to join your little friend?

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.625
Or are you going to tell us something?

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:23.917
Look at me.

01:04:25.542 --> 01:04:27.333
After watching my good friend die,

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.542
I'm one step closer to slitting your throat!

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:33.333
But tell us what we need to know,

01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:35.333
and I will give you a relief.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:40.542
For!

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:47.042
Tell me.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.208
He will not let you live,
and you cannot stop him.

01:04:51.667 --> 01:04:52.708
He's on a mission.

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:56.208
He's here to clean up this
place of corporate greed.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:58.458
Who is he?

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:01.583
Jonti.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:11.833
She said?

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:14.708
What she said?

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:18.792
Five, four left.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:20.875
What are we going to do with it?

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:26.750
I dont know.

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:29.792
She can't get out of here.

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:34.000
Do you really think you can
take that young woman's life?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Are you alright?

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:56.458
I'll be fine.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:00.458
What is it?

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.167
I feel like I'm losing consciousness.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:07.917
We are against them.

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:09.792
Right?

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.708
I had a boyfriend once who
tried to convince me of that.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.917
He brainwashed me to think
that his path was just.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:28.417
He was obsessed with getting
me to do things for him.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.208
What did he do to you?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.875
Things I spent a lot of
time trying to forget.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:45.875
There was a night when he asked me
to do something I didn't want to do.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.125
What's it?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Take a life.

01:06:57.375 --> 01:06:59.167
It was us against them, he said.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:02.583
I chose them.

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:07.458
I stabbed him in the back.

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:10.500
Literally.

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:13.125
He died?

01:07:14.292 --> 01:07:15.292
Do not.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.500
But it stayed on the floor long
enough for the police to show up.

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:24.708
Since then, I've tried to
bury that side of my past.

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:28.792
Listen...

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.333
You were protecting us tonight.

01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:34.750
Don't let it get to you.

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:38.458
After what these guys did...

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:43.250
They do not deserve your mercy.

01:07:45.792 --> 01:07:46.792
Hold tight.

01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:48.667
Don't cry, dear.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:08:00.500
No matter how we do it, until the
sniper is gone, there is no way out.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:06.042
-Can we make a barricade?
-No, nothing here can take it.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.583
They were right in the beginning.
If we wait here, we will be easy targets.

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:13.583
The cameras.

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.167
They called from the security
office, right?

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:20.832
They are watching us all the time.

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:22.625
So this is how they are in front of us.

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:26.042
She sneaked in when
she saw Nick's office.

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.167
We need to eliminate the feeds.

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:32.707
So are they watching us now?

01:08:34.582 --> 01:08:35.625
Perhaps.

01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:37.832
But if they are, they know we have one.

01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:53.417
-She's gone. -What?

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:54.625
As?

01:08:57.207 --> 01:08:58.207
Through the roof.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.292
Yes?

01:09:19.917 --> 01:09:22.292
I underestimated your resilience.

01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:25.375
"She's just a girl."

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:28.875
Don't be so delusional if you
think you have high morale here.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.832
What does it take to end this?

01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:35.917
I told you.

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:37.957
Blood.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:39.875
Your.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:46.500
If you came here for
me, why the others?

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:53.292
I was curious to see how many would die
before you actually got to the point.

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.375
It seems like there is a life in this
place that you would put before yours.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.042
Yes.

01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:19.792
Maybe your girl is
home for Easter lunch.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:24.625
I need more than maybe.

01:10:26.125 --> 01:10:29.792
You are deluded if you think you are
going to teach me a lesson in mercy.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.125
I'll get to the point.

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.833
My daughter and everyone.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.875
-Everyone gets out of here alive.
-Nick!

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:43.333
Do you want these people free?

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.750
So do something about it.

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.750
In the parking lot?

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.708
In 15 minutes.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.708
What?  You cannot go outside.

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:00.125
I need to go.

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:05.042
Nick, they won't let you go.

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:09.333
-I know. -Dad? Do not go.

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.917
They're not going to let any
of us get out of here, anyway.

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:18.833
Look, it's the only way to
get the sniper's attention.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.625
All eyes will be on me.

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:23.292
No, there has to be another way.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.000
Unless someone has a better idea.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.375
I call attention.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:35.708
Already is.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.500
You take it.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:44.208
Marissa, as soon as he's caught,
get everyone out of here.

01:11:47.292 --> 01:11:48.292
But and you?

01:11:57.625 --> 01:11:59.458
You two need to make
sure she leaves.

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:04.750
Promise me that.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.250
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:15.583
When I get out of here,
I can't guarantee that I can help.

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.333
You don't have to help me.

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.208
If we're going to do that,
we're not going to screw it up.

01:13:23.167 --> 01:13:25.208
When Nick leaves,
the three of you will go with Marissa.

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:28.292
Stick around the parking lot.

01:13:28.958 --> 01:13:30.375
They screwed up all of our cars.

01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:33.083
Lucky we had access to theirs.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:37.458
She had this,

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.208
along with a set of
keys from our office.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:41.792
Whose keys?

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:44.417
-Jo. -Shit.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:55.500
It's a lot to process,
but I need you to focus.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.917
After entering,
slam the gate and don't look back.

01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:03.208
-Expect us to leave you?
-You will find help.

01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:04.375
Send the police back.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.458
I'm still in charge here, right?

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:13.750
All right.

01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:15.833
Let's get ready.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:16.917
It's almost time.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:31.667
Honey.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:34.500
Do not Cry.

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:35.833
Do not Cry.

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:38.333
You need to stay calm.

01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:41.417
Tell me how.

01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:45.750
Remember that I put
us in this mess.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.625
I know you think your father...

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:57.042
I know you think your dad doesn't
know what he's doing, but he does.

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:00.583
I love you.

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:04.917
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.083
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.500
Put this on.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:44.875
Thanks.

01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:56.208
So this is how a face to
face with the now famous

01:16:57.583 --> 01:16:58.625
Nick Wright,

01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:00.083
It's.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:01.917
And you are?

01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:03.792
A humble citizen.

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:07.083
Here to correct a mistake.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:12.042
Killing innocent people?

01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:15.625
I see the world through a different
lens, Mr. Wright.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:19.292
But the fact of the matter is, you and me,

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:21.833
we are both bandits.

01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:24.625
You just have the law on your side.

01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:27.042
You can't seriously
compare to the two of us.

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:30.333
A comparison, I promise you,
that none of us are flattered.

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:39.500
So how do we proceed?

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:46.792
What about you...

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.208
kneel

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.042
and beg for the drug of your life?

01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:58.417
I will die before I beg.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.500
Even better.

01:19:00.208 --> 01:19:01.458
What will you do with others?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.333
They all did their part.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:10.125
And they all followed his
orders, as good soldiers should.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:13.333
But as in any war,

01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:18.542
we do not shed tears on the opposite side.

01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:24.125
And my daughter?

01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:33.417
Your castle walls,

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:36.833
they will not protect her now.

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.583
"Castle walls"?

01:19:45.417 --> 01:19:46.875
Beautiful castle walls?

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:50.792
You little piece of shit!

01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:54.583
You piece of shit!
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.708
You sit there,
you fucking disenfranchised shit,

01:19:58.917 --> 01:20:01.208
making some kind of
shit judgment on us

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.708
lucky ones, you idiot!

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:06.917
Well, that sounds great, doesn't it?

01:20:08.042 --> 01:20:10.542
At the end of the day, Mr. Wright,

01:20:11.208 --> 01:20:13.125
you snorted and snorted,

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:15.500
You blew your own house yourself.

01:20:17.167 --> 01:20:18.167
You do not see?

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:23.625
You are the big bad wolf in this scenario.

01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:33.708
The project was approved.

01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:36.125
My death will not change at all.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:45.250
It will change for my community.

01:21:01.292 --> 01:21:02.292
Wait for my signal.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:19.333
Curse!

01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:52.125
Let me guess.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.500
You...

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:58.083
wanted to meet here
to distract us,

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:01.250
while making attempts
to disarm our soldier?

01:24:03.333 --> 01:24:04.333
Is this right?

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:06.708
It was very good in theory.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.875
It was not the worst of ideas.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.917
But it didn't work now, did it?

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:38.708
Let me ask...

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.000
a little question.

01:24:43.958 --> 01:24:44.958
At the end,

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:49.125
what goes through the
mind of a man like you?

01:24:52.292 --> 01:24:54.417
Would you like to leave the
world with a little more

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.333
-It is not? -No!

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.792
The only thing that
crossed my mind was fate

01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:04.333
that will wait for you.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.542
Dad, no.

01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:17.000
Hello laura.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:23.000
You don't have to be scared.

01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:28.625
Do you want to be strong for your father now?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.042
It's ok.

01:26:00.292 --> 01:26:01.500
What can we do from here?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.167
You need to go ahead.

01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:05.292
What?  And just leave it?

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.083
We can't go without you.

01:26:09.292 --> 01:26:10.500
The phone must be working.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:12.792
We will go back to her.

01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:15.292
No, we will not leave you.

01:26:18.542 --> 01:26:19.542
Go.

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:21.167
This is an order.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.417
No!

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:38.167
Dad!

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.500
Dad!

01:26:42.625 --> 01:26:44.500
Excuse me!

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:46.125
It's going to be okay, honey.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.500
Check the phone.

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:56.125
The telephone!

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.792
-What are you doing?
-When did you drive in gear last time?

01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:16.625
Hello?

01:27:33.417 --> 01:27:34.708
Wow, the phone!

01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:42.375
I love you!

01:27:44.083 --> 01:27:46.208
You were raised as a beautiful girl.

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:49.750
Just close your eyes, baby.

01:27:50.792 --> 01:27:51.792
No!

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:54.542
Trust me, Mr. Wright.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:27:59.042
You don't want her to miss it.

01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:00.458
I love you!

01:28:03.583 --> 01:28:04.583
I love you.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.042
Dad!

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.250
It was a pleasure.

01:28:13.083 --> 01:28:14.083
Please!

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.958
Dad!

01:28:31.833 --> 01:28:32.833
Can you see him?

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:34.542
-Where is he?
-I think we lost him.

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:36.417
Just keep looking.

01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:38.208
- Keep looking. -Yes.

01:28:43.292 --> 01:28:44.292
Right!

01:28:44.958 --> 01:28:46.917
-Nick, go! -Sure!

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:54.417
It's all right.

01:29:54.583 --> 01:29:55.958
Okay, I'll get us out of here, I promise.

01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:01.792
-Shit, what was that?
-Go Nathan!

01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:03.833
Hey.

01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:07.708
Hey.

01:32:37.125 --> 01:32:38.167
Stand up.

01:32:56.958 --> 01:32:58.042
Turn around.

01:33:14.583 --> 01:33:15.833
Great shot, don't you think?

01:33:22.417 --> 01:33:23.542
Last words?

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:07.500
Close your eyes.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:35.917
Take it off.

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:39.792
What am I doing?

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:42.625
Getting help.

01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:43.750
What are you doing?

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:47.500
-Returning. -Do not go.

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:48.917
I have to go back to Laura.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:51.708
I can't lose you too.

01:34:53.875 --> 01:34:55.500
Go on, bring back help.

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:58.917
Please come back alive.

01:35:01.333 --> 01:35:02.375
I'll.

01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:03.958
I promise.

01:35:42.667 --> 01:35:44.208
I don't normally drink at work.

01:35:47.292 --> 01:35:50.125
But it has been an emotional night.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.542
I am beginning to feel
a feeling as I should.

01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:15.250
I was 11 when I saw my father die.

01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:22.250
He was killed by two television
sets and a record player.

01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:26.458
Initially, I was...

01:36:27.167 --> 01:36:30.208
devastated to think that this is
all his life weighs in the end.

01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:34.333
Then, I realized something important.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:38.667
I realized that life is only worth

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:40.750
what others are
willing to pay for it.

01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:45.375
Your father, isn't he?

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:49.083
He gave his life for yours.

01:36:51.708 --> 01:36:54.292
Most people never
experience what it is like.

01:36:56.792 --> 01:36:59.292
The memory of that man's
face will never leave me.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:02.917
When I was 15 years old,

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.542
I tracked him down.

01:37:06.583 --> 01:37:07.583
And I found it.

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:09.292
So I killed him.

01:37:17.792 --> 01:37:19.042
That man took my world.

01:37:23.042 --> 01:37:25.208
He took entirely

01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:27.125
my world.

01:37:30.375 --> 01:37:33.333
But it was because I took the
problems with my own hands

01:37:33.417 --> 01:37:34.792
that I had the ability

01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:37.542
to rebuild it.

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:46.083
Your father tried to take that away from me.

01:37:49.708 --> 01:37:51.000
It would never happen.

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:56.792
The world works in a mysterious
way, doesn't it, Laura?

01:38:02.375 --> 01:38:03.417
Look...

01:38:04.417 --> 01:38:07.792
That man, he let me live,
because I was an innocent child

01:38:08.208 --> 01:38:09.333
caught in a crossfire.

01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:12.250
But in the end,

01:38:13.417 --> 01:38:14.417
that decision,

01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:17.500
that decision was his downfall.

01:38:20.292 --> 01:38:21.500
And now here we are,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.208
and you are the innocent girl

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.667
caught in the crossfire.

01:38:30.250 --> 01:38:32.417
I just, I just want to go home.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:35.417
Me too.

01:39:42.292 --> 01:39:43.292
Hello, Riss.

01:39:47.625 --> 01:39:48.917
It took a while to get here.

01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:52.750
I've been a little busy.

01:39:54.083 --> 01:39:55.792
- I can tell if my man is...
- Dead.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.500
A lot has changed.

01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:04.292
Do not be deceived.

01:40:05.417 --> 01:40:07.083
You have come a long
way from the Grove.

01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:11.708
People don't stay there forever.

01:40:13.292 --> 01:40:14.292
Yes.

01:40:15.833 --> 01:40:18.875
But we don't expect them to light a
flame for their own community either.

01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:24.500
I was happy too.

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:30.042
You and your TKG followers took
Bosque's heart a long time ago.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.667
You're from TKG.

01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:36.250
You must have a short memory.

01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:41.500
I have a scar on my back that
reminds me of that memory,

01:40:42.208 --> 01:40:43.208
everyday.

01:40:45.583 --> 01:40:46.750
Did you know that I was here?

01:40:54.958 --> 01:40:56.625
As soon as I saw the eviction notices.

01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:00.958
So, did you come here for revenge?

01:41:07.333 --> 01:41:08.375
I came to save you.

01:41:09.333 --> 01:41:11.000
Does it look like I need to be saved?

01:41:14.083 --> 01:41:15.125
It remains to be seen.

01:41:18.375 --> 01:41:19.375
Let her go.

01:41:19.917 --> 01:41:20.958
Put the gun down.

01:41:22.625 --> 01:41:23.833
Do I look stupid?

01:41:27.833 --> 01:41:29.125
You have no choice.

01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:32.208
Of course I have.

01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:34.458
You heard it.

01:41:35.458 --> 01:41:38.458
I shoot you, you die.

01:41:40.167 --> 01:41:41.208
Good,

01:41:41.958 --> 01:41:43.042
I am ready to die.

01:41:44.917 --> 01:41:45.917
You know it.

01:41:47.958 --> 01:41:49.333
But the real question here...

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.667
Are you willing to see her die?

01:41:57.958 --> 01:41:59.583
No, I don't want to die!

01:41:59.917 --> 01:42:01.542
I don't want to die, I don't...

01:42:01.625 --> 01:42:02.625
You are not going.

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:04.708
How will it be, Riss?

01:42:30.208 --> 01:42:31.208
Riss.

01:42:37.083 --> 01:42:38.125
Walk with me again.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I promise.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.708
You will be happier this time.

01:43:15.375 --> 01:43:17.208
I will die before I
walk with you again.

01:43:27.292 --> 01:43:28.292
So be it.

01:43:45.583 --> 01:43:46.792
Riss!

01:43:59.875 --> 01:44:00.875
Do not.

01:44:11.292 --> 01:44:12.333
Ten years ago,

01:44:14.542 --> 01:44:16.708
would you walk beside me to fix

01:44:17.542 --> 01:44:18.625
this injustice.

01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.292
Ten years ago,

01:44:27.167 --> 01:44:28.333
I asked you to kill for me.

01:44:30.792 --> 01:44:31.792
Do you remember this?

01:44:35.583 --> 01:44:36.958
I asked you to kill for me,

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.958
to save your own life.

01:44:43.125 --> 01:44:44.125
Instead,

01:44:45.083 --> 01:44:46.417
you tried to outwit me

01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:48.958
and I spent ten years in prison.

01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:59.792
Will you kill for me?

01:45:09.417 --> 01:45:11.417
I don't hate you for what you did, Riss.

01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:13.958
Do not.

01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:17.458
I hate you for what you've become.

01:45:39.958 --> 01:45:41.000
Did you hear that?

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:46.125
It is a sound that I no longer need to fear.

01:45:48.792 --> 01:45:50.833
The fear of one is the salvation of another.

01:46:32.542 --> 01:46:33.542
Stay here.

01:47:49.042 --> 01:47:50.042
You didn't run.

01:47:51.292 --> 01:47:52.292
You also do not.

01:47:59.292 --> 01:48:00.292
Riss.

01:48:05.667 --> 01:48:08.417
I know I may have taken you down
a road that I didn't want to take.

01:48:09.708 --> 01:48:10.708
I got it.

01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:15.625
But considering how we grew up,

01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:19.250
what happened

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.542
with us?

01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:28.542
This is the right path, it is the only one to take.

01:48:34.417 --> 01:48:36.958
TKG is not a fair way.

01:48:39.417 --> 01:48:40.833
And die with you.

01:48:40.917 --> 01:48:43.333
The TKG is bigger than me.

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.042
Bigger than anyone!

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:49.875
I think we'll find out.

01:48:50.542 --> 01:48:51.583
I think so.

01:50:03.042 --> 01:50:04.042
It's ok.

01:50:04.208 --> 01:50:05.417
You are lucky to be alive.

01:50:08.583 --> 01:50:09.625
Laura?

01:50:09.875 --> 01:50:10.917
She is fine.

01:50:11.292 --> 01:50:12.292
She's at home.

01:50:21.125 --> 01:50:22.292
You don't have to stay.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.292
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.542
I am fine.

01:50:39.375 --> 01:50:40.375
You should go home.

01:50:44.417 --> 01:50:45.417
I do not want.

01:50:50.167 --> 01:50:51.958
There was another post on
the topic of The Herald.

01:50:59.250 --> 01:51:00.292
What?

01:51:03.417 --> 01:51:04.417
He's not dead.

01:51:10.458 --> 01:51:12.292
The body was gone when
the cops came to you.

01:51:29.083 --> 01:51:30.208
What did the post say?

01:51:33.792 --> 01:51:37.750
"The ivory tower has fallen,
but three victims remain."

01:51:39.708 --> 01:51:41.125
"They will all succumb."

01:51:42.625 --> 01:51:44.417
"Our spilled blood will not be in vain."

01:51:59.375 --> 01:52:00.792
The TKG are back.

01:52:02.708 --> 01:52:03.833
This is just the beginning.
