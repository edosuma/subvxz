WHAT I MISS MOST

00:49.708 --> 00:51.333

A BOYFRIEND--
THE SNUGGLING.

HOW EASY IT WAS

EVEN IF
THEY DID KNOW,

00:58.291 --> 00:59.792
THEY'D STILL
SCREW IT UP.

00:59.792 --> 01:00.667
SNUGGLING TO THEM

01:00.667 --> 01:04.417
IS MERELY JUST
A MEANS TO AN END.

I MEAN, I'VE BEEN SEEING
CHARLIE FOR A WEEK,

01:05.792 --> 01:08.542
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT I REALLY
KNOW ABOUT HIM

01:08.542 --> 01:10.417
IS THAT HIS BOXERS
ARE FROM THE GAP.

WORSE THINGS, YOU KNOW?

01:20.041 --> 01:22.458
I'M GONNA
GO TO THE BATHROOM,

01:22.458 --> 01:24.291
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

01:24.291 --> 01:25.375
I'D LIKE IT
VERY MUCH

IF THIS WEEK'S EPISODE
OF SEX AND THE CITY

01:27.041 --> 01:28.750
HAD COME TO AN END.

01:28.750 --> 01:29.375
OK, CHARLOTTE.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.458

IT'S BEEN THAT LONG?

02:42.959 --> 02:45.208
ONLY THAT HE WAS
IN BOSTON,

02:45.208 --> 02:46.708
NOT THAT HE WAS WORKING
AT THIS RESTAURANT.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.458

02:47.458 --> 02:48.333
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

02:48.333 --> 02:52.000

PROMISE NOT TO.

SEE HIM OR TALK TO HIM?

02:57.834 --> 02:58.834

I WANT TO SEE HIM,

DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ME.

09:01.417 --> 09:04.708
NO, ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.458
I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN THE COOKIES

09:06.458 --> 09:07.834
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN MY MAIL IN L.A.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.083
FOR OVER A WEEK.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.667
CLASS IS REALLY
THAT INTENSE, HUH?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.708
WELL, GOOD.
YOU'LL LEARN SOMETHING.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.041
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY MAIL
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
BEEN IN L.A.

09:15.041 --> 09:15.875
UH, I DON'T GET IT.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.250
I'VE BEEN IN BOSTON.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.000
UH...

09:21.000 --> 09:22.208
STILL NOT GETTING IT.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.875
[SIGH]

09:24.875 --> 09:25.834
UM...

09:27.166 --> 09:28.500
GUYS, U.S.C.
IS NOT FOR ME.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.875
I WANT TO DROP OUT.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.708
I KNOW THIS COMES
AS A SURPRISE
TO BOTH OF YOU,

09:32.708 --> 09:35.375
BUT I SPENT
THE WHOLE SUMMER
IN L.A.,

09:35.375 --> 09:36.750
AND I WENT TO
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF MY CLASSES,

09:36.750 --> 09:38.917
AND THE MAIN THING THAT
I LEARNED ABOUT L.A.

09:38.917 --> 09:43.041
IS THAT L.A. IS
JUST NOT WHERE I
WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.041
AND BOSTON IS?

09:45.041 --> 09:46.166
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE IN BOSTON.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.333
OH, HONEY. YOU'LL MAKE
NEW FRIENDS IN CALIFORNIA.

09:48.333 --> 09:51.208
IT JUST TAKES SOME TIME.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.834
MOM, IT'S
MORE THAN THAT.

09:52.834 --> 09:53.875
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

09:53.875 --> 09:54.959
I'M...

09:56.834 --> 09:58.875
I'M AT A PROFOUND
CROSSROADS IN MY LIFE,

09:58.875 --> 10:01.750
AND I KNOW THAT IF I
DON'T CHOOSE THIS PATH,

10:01.750 --> 10:03.542
I'M GOING TO HAVE
SIGNIFICANT REGRETS.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.583
Gale: HMM...

10:05.583 --> 10:06.583
WHERE WOULD YOU LIVE?

10:06.583 --> 10:09.792
UH, WITH JACK
AND JEN AT GRAMS'.

10:09.792 --> 10:10.875
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

10:10.875 --> 10:11.917
FIND A NEW SCHOOL.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.083
OH, DAWSON.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.291
MOM, I KNOW I SOUND
LIKE A COMPLETE FLAKE,

10:14.291 --> 10:15.500
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
I'VE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.417
I'VE GIVEN THIS
SOME THOUGHT MYSELF,

10:19.417 --> 10:21.834
AND I'VE DECIDED...

10:23.333 --> 10:24.834
YOU'RE NOT
DROPPING OUT.

10:24.834 --> 10:25.792
IT DOESN'T
WORK LIKE THAT, DAD.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.959
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO STAND HERE

10:27.959 --> 10:28.458
AND TALK TO ME
ABOUT CROSSROADS

10:28.458 --> 10:30.291
AND PATHS

10:30.291 --> 10:31.667
SO YOU CAN
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL

10:31.667 --> 10:33.166
AND GO CRASH ON A SOFA,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.333
THEN DON'T
PRESUME TO TALK TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE AN ADULT.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.625
[LILY CRYING]

10:37.625 --> 10:40.125
Gale: OH! LILY,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.125
[SIGHS]

10:52.875 --> 10:54.417
WELCOME HOME.

11:01.542 --> 11:02.542
Audrey: OK.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.625
SO WHO'S THE GUY?

11:04.625 --> 11:05.834
WHAT GUY?

11:05.834 --> 11:07.083
THE GUY WHO YOU SAW
AT THE RESTAURANT
LAST NIGHT

11:07.083 --> 11:09.917
THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS
SOME HUGE IMPACT
ON YOUR LIFE.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.458
AUDREY, THE ONLY GUY
THAT HAS AN IMPACT
ON MY LIFE RIGHT NOW

11:11.458 --> 11:13.667
IS JAMES JOYCE,

11:13.667 --> 11:14.792
AND I CAN'T FOCUS ON HIM
UNTIL I GET THIS ROOM
IN ORDER.

11:17.792 --> 11:18.792
YOU KNOW...

11:18.792 --> 11:20.875
BACK IN L.A.,

11:20.875 --> 11:22.333
I WAS SOMETHING
OF A THERAPIST

11:22.333 --> 11:23.542
TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.375
PEOPLE WOULD CALL ME
ALL THE TIME

11:24.375 --> 11:25.875
TO TALK ABOUT
THEIR PROBLEMS.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.417
SOME EVEN PAID THE SURCHARGE
TO CALL FROM THE VALLEY,

11:27.417 --> 11:29.875
AND...LUCKY YOU,

11:29.875 --> 11:32.417
YOU'VE GOT ME HERE
WHENEVER YOU WANT ME.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.000
LUCKY ME.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
SO WHY DON'T YOU
STOP CLEANING UP THE MESS
AND TELL ME ABOUT HIM?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.792
DON'T YOU HAVE
A LACROSSE TEAM
TO DATE OR SOMETHING?

11:41.834 --> 11:42.417
I HAVE THIS THEORY
ABOUT YOU.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.667
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

11:44.667 --> 11:45.792
NO.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.166
YOU LOVE ACADEMIA
BECAUSE OF THE RULES,

11:47.166 --> 11:50.708
AND YOU HATE RELATIONSHIPS
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THEM.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.625
SO DO YOU WANT
TO SEE HIM OR NOT?

11:58.208 --> 12:00.083
YES.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.000
NO.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.875
YES, BUT ONLY IF HE
WANTS TO SEE ME,

12:03.875 --> 12:04.959
AND HE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T.

12:04.959 --> 12:05.959
HA!

12:05.959 --> 12:08.375
GOD, YOU'RE DENSE.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.208
OF COURSE
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.792
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

12:11.792 --> 12:13.500
BECAUSE...

12:13.500 --> 12:14.542
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL

12:14.542 --> 12:16.667
AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

12:16.667 --> 12:20.041
BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.708
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GIRL
THAT GUYS NEVER GET OVER.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.583
JOEY, YOU'RE
THE KIND OF GIRL

12:24.583 --> 12:25.917
THAT OTHER GIRLS
GET COMPARED TO.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.959
I DON'T--

12:29.959 --> 12:31.500
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE HIM
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.458
WHY DO I THINK YOU DON'T
WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE?

12:35.458 --> 12:36.625
IT'S COMPLICATED.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.917
I MEAN, IT ENDED MESSY,

12:37.917 --> 12:40.333
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.834
JOEY, NO ONE'S
GONNA GRADE YOU

12:41.834 --> 12:43.542
ON HOW YOU HANDLE THIS,
YOU KNOW?

12:43.542 --> 12:45.375
NO ONE'S
GONNA COME ALONG

12:45.375 --> 12:47.375
AND TELL YOU
WHAT'S EXPECTED

12:47.375 --> 12:49.125
SO YOU KNOW
HOW TO SUCCEED.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.000
RELATIONSHIPS ARE MESSY.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.250
THAT'S THEIR NATURE.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.875
THEY START MESSY,
AND THEY END MESSY,

12:54.875 --> 12:56.875
AND IF YOU EVER
WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER
RELATIONSHIP IN YOUR LIFE,

12:56.875 --> 13:00.875
YOU BETTER JUST STOP
WORRYING ABOUT THE MESS.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.875
Blossom: DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS, McPHEE?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.750
I'M NOT EVEN
SURE WHERE I AM.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.792
THE INNER CHAPTER ROOM.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.458
SIGMAS DON'T LET YOU
DRINK AND DRIVE.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.083
WE PLAN ON
KEEPING OUR HOUSE.

13:22.417 --> 13:23.750
SEE THESE PICTURES
ON THE WALL?

13:24.792 --> 13:26.166
EVERY ONE
OF THESE SIGMA MEN

13:26.166 --> 13:28.291
LOOKED AT THE VERY
SAME THING YOU'RE
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.333
THIS IS YOUR FUTURE,
JACK.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.542
OPEN IT.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.625
WOW!

13:40.333 --> 13:42.708
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I ACCEPT?

13:43.750 --> 13:44.959
YOU LIVE IN THE HOUSE,

13:44.959 --> 13:46.792
YOU EAT YOUR MEALS HERE,

13:46.792 --> 13:48.208
YOUR PROBLEMS
BECOME OUR PROBLEMS,

13:48.208 --> 13:49.625
YOUR SUCCESS, OUR SUCCESS.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.625
WE'RE YOUR BROTHERS,
YOUR FAMILY.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.458
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
JACK?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.667
[CHUCKLES]

13:55.667 --> 13:57.417
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

13:57.417 --> 13:58.834
IT'S ALL KIND OF
OVERWHELMING.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.708
THERE COMES A POINT
IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE

14:00.708 --> 14:02.500
WHEN HE HAS TO ASK HIMSELF
THAT ONE FUNDAMENTAL
QUESTION--

14:02.500 --> 14:05.750
AM I IN OR AM I OUT?

14:08.708 --> 14:11.041
YEAH...

14:11.041 --> 14:14.291
YEAH, I'VE ASKED MYSELF
THAT QUESTION, ACTUALLY,

14:14.291 --> 14:18.500
AND I THINK YOU GUYS
REALLY NEED
TO KNOW THE ANSWER.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.041
I'M GAY.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.166
[LAUGHTER]

14:26.667 --> 14:28.041
YOU THOUGHT
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.000
MOST PEOPLE
ARE SURPRISED.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.417
MOST PEOPLE
AREN'T SIGMA PEOPLE.

14:32.417 --> 14:33.458
YOU'RE SIGMA PEOPLE,
JACK.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.166
YOU'RE ONE OF US.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.041
YOU MEAN, THERE'S
OTHER GUYS IN THE HOUSE
THAT ARE GAY?

14:38.000 --> 14:38.708
YOU'D BE THE FIRST.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.667
MOST FRATERNITIES

14:40.667 --> 14:42.291
ARE NOT PARTICULARLY
WELL-KNOWN

14:42.291 --> 14:45.959
FOR, YOU KNOW,
THEIR TOLERANCE TOWARDS
ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES.

14:45.959 --> 14:48.333
WHICH IS PRECISELY
WHY WE NEED YOU
IN THIS HOUSE, McPHEE.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.708
LISTEN, SIGMA EP
HAS A REPUTATION

14:49.708 --> 14:51.041
FOR BEING ONE
OF THE ROUGHEST,
PARTY-HEARTY,

14:51.041 --> 14:53.500
ALPHA MALE FRATERNITIES
ON CAMPUS,

14:53.500 --> 14:55.083
A REPUTATION WHICH IS
NOT ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.750
THE DEAN WANTS US
TO DIVERSIFY.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.291
THE DEAN GETS
WHAT THE DEAN WANTS,

15:00.291 --> 15:02.542
SO, YES, JACK,
WE KNOW YOU'RE GAY,

15:02.542 --> 15:06.041
AND WE WANT YOU
IN THIS HOUSE
BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY.

15:11.083 --> 15:14.208
SO...WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?

15:14.708 --> 15:16.542
I DON'T KNOW.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.375
THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES.

15:19.542 --> 15:22.625
AND THAT WOULD BE?

15:22.625 --> 15:23.959
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.166
YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
SLEEPING WITH YOU
FOR A WEEK

15:25.166 --> 15:27.917
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT COLOR YOUR EYES ARE?

15:27.917 --> 15:29.458
HUMOR ME.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.417
BROWN.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.041
WITH SUBTLE
FLECKS OF GREEN.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.792
LOOK, IT'S NOT
ENTIRELY MY FAULT

15:38.792 --> 15:40.708
THAT WE JUST
HAPPEN TO HAVE
A COMPLETELY NORMAL,

15:40.708 --> 15:45.208
HEALTHY, ACTIVE SEX LIFE.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.208
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:46.208 --> 15:48.083
THAT IT'S MY FAULT?

15:48.083 --> 15:50.583
NO. I'M JUST SAYING
THAT NEITHER ONE OF US

15:50.583 --> 15:53.583
HAS VERY MUCH IN
THE WAY OF SELF-CONTROL.

15:53.583 --> 15:54.542
HUH!

15:54.542 --> 15:56.917
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT WE COULD GO A DAY

15:56.917 --> 15:59.583
WITHOUT HAVING SEX
OF ANY KIND?

15:59.583 --> 16:00.750
A DAY?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.667
ARE YOU INSANE, WOMAN?

16:03.667 --> 16:06.375
WE'D BE LUCKY
TO MAKE IT 12 HOURS.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.959
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:07.959 --> 16:09.875
AFRAID YOU COULDN'T
HOLD OUT?

16:12.166 --> 16:13.917
NOW, YOU SEE...

16:13.917 --> 16:16.250
I KNOW I CAN HOLD OUT.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.792
I'M JUST
NOT SURE YOU CAN.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.542
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.
BRING IT ON.

16:21.542 --> 16:25.000
12 HOURS, STARTING
RIGHT NOW, NO SEX.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.083
NO.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.583
NO. WHAT--OH!

16:34.625 --> 16:35.792
HUH.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.708
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF BED.

16:38.708 --> 16:39.875
GOOD IDEA.

16:46.542 --> 16:47.667
SO IS IT ME?

16:47.667 --> 16:49.333
DID I FORGET TO REPLACE
THE PAPER TOWELS

16:49.333 --> 16:50.834
IN THE EMPLOYEE
WASHROOM?

16:52.792 --> 16:53.667
YOU KNOW,
BRECHER TOLD ME

16:53.667 --> 16:54.583
THAT THE WAITRESSES
WERE MOODY,

16:54.583 --> 16:56.458
BUT YOU, MADAME,
ARE OFF THE CHARTS,

16:56.458 --> 16:58.750
AND THAT GUY IS
A TOTAL, COMPLETE,
AND UTTER WACKJOB,

16:58.750 --> 16:59.875
BECAUSE HE CAUGHT ME
TOUCHING ONE OF
THE PANS TODAY,

16:59.875 --> 17:02.333
AND THE GUY
ALMOST SNAPPED.

17:02.333 --> 17:05.000
"PUT DOWN THE IRONCLAD
AND STEP AWAY
FROM THE STOVE."

17:05.000 --> 17:07.834
ALLCLAD.
HUH?

17:07.834 --> 17:09.416
WHY WOULD HE LET YOU
MESS WITH SOMETHING

17:09.416 --> 17:10.959
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE NAME OF?

17:10.959 --> 17:14.165
OH, COME ON.
JUST HATE HIM WITH ME
FOR A SECOND, WOULD YOU?

17:14.165 --> 17:15.165
YOU KNOW, NOTHING'LL BOND
TWO COLLEAGUES QUICKER

17:15.165 --> 17:16.165
THAN BITCHING
ABOUT THE BOSS.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.165
WE'RE NOT COLLEAGUES.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.040
THIS ISN'T A LAW FIRM.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.208
I WAIT FOR PEOPLE.
YOU COOK FOR THEM.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.040
UH, NO. I DON'T
ACTUALLY COOK FOR THEM.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.416
I JUST GET TO CUT
THEIR POTATOES
INTO PAPER-THIN SLICES

17:24.416 --> 17:27.040
FOR REASONS THAT ARE,
QUITE FRANKLY, BEYOND ME.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.083
THE WHOLE JOB
IS BEYOND YOU.

17:29.083 --> 17:29.875
OK.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.333
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

17:32.333 --> 17:35.750
HE'S GOT YOU DOING
CLASSIC CULINARY
PREP WORK.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.000
YOU HAVE TO
WEAR THE HAT

17:37.000 --> 17:38.333
SO THAT SOME
NICE YOUNG WOMAN

17:38.333 --> 17:39.708
WHO'S HERE
ON HER FIRST DATE

17:39.708 --> 17:41.000
DOESN'T PUKE
IN THE LADIES' ROOM

17:41.000 --> 17:43.083
WHEN SHE FINDS A STRAND
OF YOUR GREASY HAIR

17:43.083 --> 17:44.041
IN HER PUMPKIN PUREE,

17:44.041 --> 17:45.500
AND THE ONLY PROBLEM
I HAVE

17:45.500 --> 17:46.708
IS THAT I'M
WORKING WITH SOMEONE

17:46.708 --> 17:49.542
WHOSE SOLE QUALIFICATION
FOR THIS JOB
IS HIS GENDER.

17:49.542 --> 17:50.250
WELL, YOU SEE,
THIS IS GOOD.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.917
WE'RE MAKING
PROGRESS NOW

17:51.917 --> 17:53.125
BECAUSE YOU
JUST EXPLODED ON ME.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.750
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.000
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.458
I USED TO SPEND
HOURS AND HOURS
JUST SITTING AROUND

18:10.458 --> 18:12.375
THINKING ABOUT MY LIFE.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.458
WHY'D YOU STOP?

18:13.458 --> 18:16.667
WELL, I GUESS I GOT
TOO BUSY LIVING IT

18:16.667 --> 18:19.000
TO SIT AROUND
REFLECTING ON IT.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.166
I HOPE I NEVER
GET TO THAT PLACE.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.083
DAWSON...

18:24.083 --> 18:25.667
I AM SLEEPING
IN THE ROOM
WITH A BABY MONITOR.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.000
I'M TIRED,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.750
SO DON'T B.S. ME.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.250
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.458
THIS IS ABOUT A GIRL.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.333
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

18:38.542 --> 18:39.917
YOU'VE BEEN
MAKING MOVIES

18:39.917 --> 18:41.625
EVER SINCE YOU
WERE A LITTLE BOY.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.000
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT
U.S.C. WHEN YOU WERE 10,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.291
AND FOR
THE LAST 4 YEARS,

18:45.291 --> 18:47.125
IT'S BEEN
THE FRIGGING MANTRA
OF THE LEERY HOUSEHOLD.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.125
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

18:48.125 --> 18:49.959
YOU WORK YOUR TAIL OFF.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.125
YOU OVERCOME
HELL AND HIGH WATER

18:51.125 --> 18:52.291
AND THE KIND
OF ADVERSITY

18:52.291 --> 18:54.083
THAT WOULD SEND
ORDINARY KIDS
RUNNING FOR COVER,

18:54.083 --> 18:55.583
AND YOU ACTUALLY
DO THE IMPOSSIBLE,

18:55.583 --> 18:57.458
AND YOU GET YOURSELF IN.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.291
YOU DID IT, DAWSON.

18:59.291 --> 19:02.375
YOU...DID IT.

19:03.792 --> 19:07.500
NOW HERE YOU ARE...

19:07.500 --> 19:08.834
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU,

19:08.834 --> 19:10.542
AND YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT CHUCKING IT
ALL AWAY?

19:10.542 --> 19:11.917
WHAT ARE YOU--
YOU CRAZY?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.917
MAYBE A LITTLE.

19:13.917 --> 19:18.500
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT STANDING AT
A CROSSROADS, FINE,

19:18.500 --> 19:20.291
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE,
CHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.959
DAD, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO DO.

19:21.959 --> 19:22.834
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

19:22.834 --> 19:25.583
YOU'RE FOLLOWING
JOEY DOWN HERS.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.625
[SIGHS]

19:26.625 --> 19:30.583
I KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE MEANS TO YOU,

19:30.583 --> 19:32.625
BUT DO YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S WISE

19:32.625 --> 19:33.333
TO MAKE MAJOR
LIFE DECISIONS

19:33.333 --> 19:35.625
BASED ON
SOMEONE ELSE?

19:36.625 --> 19:37.917
REMEMBER, THIS ISN'T
HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE.

19:37.917 --> 19:40.708
THE STAKES ARE HIGH.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.041
YOUR DECISIONS
HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.166
GOD, COME ON.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.375
DAD, HONESTLY, DO YOU
THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

19:46.375 --> 19:47.917
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW THAT THIS

19:47.917 --> 19:49.834
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
DECISION OF MY LIFE?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.125
THEN MAKE THE RIGHT ONE.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.667
DAD, IT'S
NOT THAT SIMPLE.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.834
IT REALLY IS.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.333
DAWSON...

19:56.333 --> 19:59.208
I HAVE LIVED
TWICE AS LONG AS YOU,

19:59.208 --> 20:00.875
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO
GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT
OF MY EXPERIENCES.

20:00.875 --> 20:06.250
DAD, I CAN'T LIVE
THE LIFE THAT YOU
WANT ME TO HAVE.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.000
I CAN'T LIVE THE LIFE
THAT YOU CHOOSE
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.917
I HAVE TO HAVE MY OWN.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.125
YOUR OWN?

20:12.125 --> 20:12.333
YES.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.417
FINE.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.375
HERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY
TO HAVE THE LIFE
YOU'VE WANTED

20:19.375 --> 20:21.792
EVER SINCE
YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.166
I BOOKED YOU
ON THE 3:30 TOMORROW.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.875
SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY,
DAWSON.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.792
SEIZE IT.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.917
IT'LL BE GONE
IN A MOMENT...

20:43.333 --> 20:46.291
AND THAT'S LIFE.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.333
Gale: I'VE GOT A LITTLE
CONFESSION TO MAKE.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.333
IT'S COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY SELFISH,

21:06.333 --> 21:09.208
BUT I TOTALLY WANT HIM
TO DROP OUT OF U.S.C.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.333
AND COME BACK
AND BE CLOSE TO US.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.458
OH, COME ON.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.625
WHEN I SAW HIM OUT THERE
STANDING IN THE YARD,

21:15.625 --> 21:17.250
MY HEART PRETTY MUCH
LEAPT OUT OF MY CHEST,

21:17.250 --> 21:19.417
AND I THOUGHT,
"GOD, I MISS THIS KID."

21:19.417 --> 21:21.542
I MISS HAVING HIM AROUND

21:21.542 --> 21:23.583
AND SEEING HIM ACROSS
THE TABLE AT DINNER.

21:23.583 --> 21:27.458
I MISS HEARING WHAT
HE THINKS ABOUT WHATEVER
MOVIE HE'S JUST SEEN.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.333
Mitch:
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVE MY LIFE?

21:32.333 --> 21:35.291
I HAVE
THIS AMAZING FAMILY.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.458
OHH.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.834
I MEAN, I KNOW
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT,

21:37.834 --> 21:39.542
BUT, TRUST ME, I'VE BEEN
AROUND THE BLOCK
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

21:39.542 --> 21:43.375
THAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS SO INCREDIBLY RARE.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.917
YEAH.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.959
BUT YOU SEE...

21:47.959 --> 21:51.291
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I'VE EVER REALLY
BEEN GOOD AT.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.291
OH, HONEY.

21:52.291 --> 21:55.000
NO, NO, NO.
I'M A FAMILY MAN.

21:56.542 --> 21:58.542
I CAN SAY
WITH RELATIVE CERTAINTY

21:58.542 --> 22:00.917
THAT I WILL NEVER
WRITE A POEM...

22:00.917 --> 22:02.834
HA HA!

22:02.834 --> 22:04.625
OR PAINT A PAINTING
OR MAKE A MOVIE

22:04.625 --> 22:06.834
THAT WILL
CHANGE THE WORLD.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.125
JUST WASN'T
IN THE CARDS FOR ME,

22:10.125 --> 22:11.083
AND THAT'S OK

22:11.083 --> 22:13.583
BECAUSE MAYBE,
JUST MAYBE...

22:15.959 --> 22:17.625
OUR SON WILL DO THAT.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.375
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

22:28.375 --> 22:30.333
WHAT CAN I SAY?

22:30.333 --> 22:32.875
I LOVE MY BOYS.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.208
THIS IS WORKING.

22:46.208 --> 22:48.000
THIS IS TOTALLY WORKING.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.125
TWO PEOPLE,
TWO CUPS OF COFFEE,

22:49.125 --> 22:51.083
JUST DOING WHAT PEOPLE DO
WHO DON'T HAVE SEX.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.959
GOING TO A MOVIE?

22:52.959 --> 22:54.917
MM-HMM.

22:54.917 --> 22:55.583
UM, CHECK THIS OUT.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.417
FELLINI RETROSPECTIVE--

22:56.417 --> 23:00.208
LA STRADA,
LA DOLCE VITA...

23:00.208 --> 23:03.000
UH, NO,
I CAN'T DO IT.
NO SUBTITLES.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.250
NO SUBTITLES?

23:06.166 --> 23:07.083
NO. I CAN'T
STAND THEM.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.625
YOU KNOW,
IF I WANT TO READ,

23:08.625 --> 23:10.375
I'LL PICK UP A BOOK.

23:10.375 --> 23:13.291
WHAT HAPPENED TO
"I'LL SEE ANYTHING"?

23:13.291 --> 23:14.750
WELL, ANYTHING
WITHOUT SUBTITLES.

23:15.417 --> 23:18.208
NOT EVEN ACTION MOVIES?

23:18.208 --> 23:21.834
NO JOHN WOO, JACKIE CHAN,
CROUCHING TIGER?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.542
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF PROBLEM FOR YOU?

23:23.959 --> 23:26.291
NO.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.375
NO.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.834
NO. NO.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.041
I MEAN...

23:31.041 --> 23:33.667
IT'S NOT LIKE
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
ON SUBTITLES

23:33.667 --> 23:34.875
SPELLS DOOM FOR
A RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.542
I MEAN, SO WHAT REALLY?

23:36.542 --> 23:39.583
SO WHAT THAT I HAVE
AN OVERWHELMING
PHYSICAL ATTRACTION

23:39.583 --> 23:41.583
TO SOMEBODY WHO
CATEGORICALLY REJECTS
THE VERY BEST

23:41.583 --> 23:43.208
THAT WORLD CINEMA
HAS TO OFFER

23:43.208 --> 23:44.417
JUST BECAUSE HE'S
A LITTLE TOO LAZY

23:44.417 --> 23:45.500
TO READ THE WORDS
ON THE SCREEN.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.583
NOW, SEE?
YOU'RE MAD.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.458
NO, NO. THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.333
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS TALKING ABOUT--

23:49.333 --> 23:51.083
US GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER NATURALLY.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.250
YOU LEARN A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT ME,

23:52.250 --> 23:54.250
I LEARN A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

23:54.250 --> 23:56.834
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THESE 12 HOURS ARE UP,

23:56.834 --> 23:57.625
AND WE CAN HAVE SEX AGAIN.

24:00.542 --> 24:03.333
Jack: I GOT A BID
TO JOIN SIGMA.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.917
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.583
TOBEY DOESN'T THINK SO.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.250
HE CALLED ME
"THE GAY UNCLE TOM."

24:08.250 --> 24:11.417
HE'S CONVINCED THAT THEY
ONLY WANT ME TO FILL
SOME KIND OF QUOTA,

24:11.417 --> 24:13.375
WHICH ISN'T
ENTIRELY UNTRUE.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.417
HOW DO YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU'RE OVER THERE?

24:17.417 --> 24:18.708
WELL, SEE, THAT'S
THE WEIRD THING.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.917
I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MY LIFE,

24:20.917 --> 24:22.500
I FEEL LIKE I'VE
FINALLY FOUND A PLACE

24:22.500 --> 24:23.375
WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE,
YOU KNOW?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.708
I FIT IN
WITH THESE GUYS.

24:25.708 --> 24:26.667
WHAT'S WEIRD
ABOUT THAT?

24:26.667 --> 24:29.083
I'D BE THE ONLY GAY GUY
IN THE HOUSE.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.792
OH.

24:32.458 --> 24:35.708
WELL, IT SOUNDS
TO ME LIKE...

24:35.708 --> 24:40.000
IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE
WITH YOU THAN IT IS
WITH THEM.

24:41.875 --> 24:43.333
YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.792
YOU'RE RIGHT,

24:45.792 --> 24:48.583
BUT THAT'S STRANGE
BECAUSE IT'S TYPICALLY
NOT HOW I AM.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.625
BUT IT IS TYPICALLY
HOW TOBEY IS.

24:51.875 --> 24:55.834
IF THESE FELLOWS KNOW YOU
1/10 AS WELL AS I KNOW YOU,

24:55.834 --> 24:56.792
I AM QUITE CERTAIN
THEY WANT YOU

24:56.792 --> 24:59.458
FOR MUCH MORE
THAN FILLING A QUOTA.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.875
DID JOEY ASK YOU
TO STAY IN BOSTON?

25:11.875 --> 25:14.667
NO.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.959
ARE YOU TWO...

25:16.959 --> 25:17.917
TOGETHER?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.625
NO.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.542
[SIGHS]

25:23.542 --> 25:26.500
IT MAKES NO LOGICAL
SENSE. I KNOW.

25:27.708 --> 25:27.792
OHH.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.417
THE PAST FEW YEARS
OF MY LIFE,

25:32.417 --> 25:35.083
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WITHOUT
A CLEAR-CUT OBJECTIVE.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.750
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ASKING MYSELF,
"WHAT'S MY GOAL?

25:37.750 --> 25:38.875
WHAT AM I TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH?"

25:40.041 --> 25:41.542
AND MY WHOLE LIFE,

25:41.542 --> 25:44.458
EVERYBODY'S
ALWAYS BEEN TELLING ME
TO FOLLOW MY HEART.

25:44.458 --> 25:45.708
THE IRONY IS,
NOW THAT I'VE
FINALLY FIGURED OUT

25:45.708 --> 25:46.375
WHAT THAT MEANS,
EVERYBODY'S TELLING ME

25:46.375 --> 25:49.250
I'M CRAZY IF I DO IT.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.583
NO, HONEY. I'M NOT SAYING
NOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART,

25:51.583 --> 25:52.792
BUT...

25:53.750 --> 25:55.542
PEOPLE CHANGE, DAWSON.

25:55.542 --> 25:57.208
IT'S A FACT.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.917
YOU, ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS,
YOU'RE ALL GONNA CHANGE.

25:59.917 --> 26:02.542
SO IF YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT
YOU WANT TO BE WITH JOEY,

26:02.542 --> 26:06.208
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PREVENT
EITHER ONE OF YOU

26:06.208 --> 26:07.875
FROM GROWING.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.417
AND, SWEETHEART,
I AM NOT DISMISSING

26:09.417 --> 26:11.583
THIS BEAUTIFUL IDEA
OF SOUL MATES,

26:11.583 --> 26:14.875
BUT THE REALITY
OF ETERNAL COUPLING...

26:14.875 --> 26:17.750
WELL, QUITE FRANKLY,
IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE THING...

26:19.375 --> 26:20.792
FAITH.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.542
SO ASK YOURSELF
THIS QUESTION--

26:23.542 --> 26:26.417
IS JOEY
THE KIND OF PERSON

26:26.417 --> 26:30.208
THAT YOU ARE WILLING
TO TAKE A VERY BIG
LEAP OF FAITH FOR?

26:35.959 --> 26:36.333
COKE.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.083
PEPSI.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.291
EXILE IN GUYVILLE.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.417
EXILE ON MAIN STREET.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.917
FAVORITE PRESIDENT?

26:41.917 --> 26:43.250
I DON'T KNOW.
LINCOLN?

26:43.250 --> 26:44.333
HMM.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.083
I AM FROM ILLINOIS.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.583
FAVORITE
CHARLIE'S ANGEL?

26:46.583 --> 26:47.583
CAMERON DIAZ.

26:47.583 --> 26:48.959
NOW CAN WE JUST
GET BACK TO PLAYING GIN?

26:48.959 --> 26:50.291
NO.

26:50.291 --> 26:52.583
NOT UNTIL WE FIND
SOMETHING THAT
WE HAVE IN COMMON.

26:52.583 --> 26:55.250
LOOK. WE ALREADY HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON--SEX.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.500
WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO
FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.500
YOU CAN'T BASE
A RELATIONSHIP
PURELY ON SEX.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.834
NOW, YOU SEE,
I BEG TO DIFFER.

26:59.834 --> 27:02.458
SEX IS A PRETTY BIG THING
TO HAVE IN COMMON.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.166
I MEAN, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE TRYING
TO PROVE HERE?

27:04.166 --> 27:07.792
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
COULD THERE BE

27:07.792 --> 27:09.625
FOR TWO INTELLIGENT,
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE

27:09.625 --> 27:12.291
WHO JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
AN OVERWHELMING PHYSICAL
ATTRACTION FOR EACH OTHER

27:12.291 --> 27:13.708
TO DENY THAT ATTRACTION?

27:14.875 --> 27:18.375
OH, WHY ARE YOU LEAVING
YOUR SIDE OF THE ROOM?

27:19.417 --> 27:20.375
BECAUSE.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.417
ARE YOU KIDDING?

27:21.417 --> 27:23.250
NO. ARE YOU?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.667
NO.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.625
OK.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.083
OK, BUT THIS
DOES NOT MEAN

27:28.083 --> 27:29.166
THAT WE'RE GONNA
GIVE UP ON FINDING

27:29.166 --> 27:30.625
SOMETHING THAT
WE HAVE IN COMMON,
AGREED.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.792
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
AT SOME POINT,

27:31.792 --> 27:33.500
THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAS TO MOVE
OUT OF THE ROOM.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.000
AGREED.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.375
I'M SURE THAT THIS
IS JUST A STAGE,

27:36.375 --> 27:37.792
AND AS LONG AS BOTH
PEOPLE ARE INTELLIGENT
AND RESPONSIBLE,

27:37.792 --> 27:38.917
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE CAN'T HAVE--

27:41.834 --> 27:43.500
WHAT?

27:44.917 --> 27:45.458
WE USED THE LAST ONE
LAST NIGHT.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.792
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.875
WELL, GO FIND ONE.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.166
WHAT?

27:53.166 --> 27:55.667
GO BORROW ONE.
GO GET ONE.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.667
WHY BORROW
WHEN WE CAN STEAL?

27:57.667 --> 27:58.875
COME ON. LET'S GO.
COME ON.

27:58.875 --> 28:01.166
WHAT--
WHERE--
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.166
LOOK. WE'RE TAKING
THIS RELATIONSHIP
OUT OF THE BEDROOM,

28:02.166 --> 28:03.959
ALL RIGHT?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.542
Joey: YOU CAN'T
SEE THEM VERY WELL,
CAN YOU,

28:40.542 --> 28:43.375
AT NIGHT
IN THE CITY?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.708
WHAT, THE STARS?

28:47.708 --> 28:49.125
UM...

28:50.458 --> 28:52.375
NO, YOU CAN'T
SEE THEM VERY WELL,
BUT WHAT THE HELL?

28:52.375 --> 28:54.542
I'VE SEEN THEM ALL
BEFORE, RIGHT?

28:58.792 --> 29:00.333
ME, TOO.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.708
SO I'M GUESSING
THAT THIS MEANS

29:05.708 --> 29:07.708
THAT LINDLEY
SOLD ME OUT, HUH?

29:07.708 --> 29:09.542
AH, GO EASY ON HER.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.375
I SAW YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.166
AH, YEAH.

29:12.166 --> 29:15.041
MY NEW
STOMPING GROUNDS.

29:15.041 --> 29:16.208
WELL, AFTER THAT,

29:16.208 --> 29:17.917
SHE DID UNRAVEL
LIKE A CHEAP SUIT.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.917
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
SHE HASN'T BEEN AROUND
TO SEE ME LATELY.

29:19.917 --> 29:23.917
NO, THAT WOULD BE
BECAUSE SHE MET A GUY.

29:23.917 --> 29:25.542
REALLY?

29:25.542 --> 29:27.000
THAT'S GOOD FOR HER.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
YEAH.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.792
SO I GUESS, UM,

29:33.792 --> 29:36.000
SHE'S TOLD YOU ABOUT
THESE SUNDAY DINNERS
WE'VE BEEN HAVING.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.125
UH, YEAH.

29:37.125 --> 29:39.250
I SEEM TO
REMEMBER SOMETHING
TO THAT EFFECT.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.583
WELL, IT'S--
IT'S NICE.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.750
I MEAN, WE TRY
TO GET TOGETHER
EVERY WEEK

29:41.750 --> 29:45.625
BECAUSE IT'S EASY
TO GET LOST
IN THE BIG CITY.

29:45.625 --> 29:47.375
WELL,
OF COURSE IT IS.

29:47.375 --> 29:47.917
YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH STARS
TO GUIDE YOU.

29:49.792 --> 29:52.333
YOU SHOULD TRY
TO COME SOME TIME.

29:54.792 --> 29:54.959
I'LL TRY
AND DO THAT.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.250
BECAUSE, PACE,
I WOULD--

30:01.500 --> 30:03.417
I WOULD HATE THAT...

30:03.417 --> 30:05.959
YOU NOT COMING HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME.

30:05.959 --> 30:07.000
WITH YOU?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.125
OR THIS THING WE SHARED
CALLED THE ROMANCE.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.458
YOU KNOW,
I DID REALLY BADLY,

30:12.458 --> 30:15.959
AND THERE WAS BITTERNESS
AND TEARS AND...

30:15.959 --> 30:17.333
RECRIMINATION.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.375
YEAH. I THINK
I REMEMBER THAT.

30:19.375 --> 30:20.708
WE DATED ONCE,
RIGHT?

30:20.708 --> 30:22.792
YEAH, WE DID, DIDN'T WE?

30:25.333 --> 30:26.041
BUT, YOU KNOW,

30:26.041 --> 30:27.625
I'VE PRACTICALLY FORGOTTEN

30:27.625 --> 30:29.417
NOW THAT I'VE SLEPT
WITH HALF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

30:29.417 --> 30:31.417
REALLY? JUST HALF?

30:31.417 --> 30:34.458
I THINK THAT SHOWS
INCREDIBLE RESTRAINT
ON YOUR PART.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.708
WELL, I HAD TO LEAVE HALF
FOR MY ROOMMATE.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.583
OH, ROOMMATE.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.500
OH, LORD.
I FEEL SORRY
FOR THIS PERSON.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
24 HOURS A DAY,
CONFINED IN A SMALL
SPACE WITH YOU--

30:43.500 --> 30:46.250
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.250
I DON'T SNORE.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.041
I BEG TO DIFFER.

30:51.625 --> 30:54.834
SO, PACE, UM...

30:54.834 --> 30:57.625
THE OTHER DAY, I HAD
TO READ THIS ARTICLE
FOR BIOLOGY,

30:57.625 --> 31:01.166
AND IT SAID THAT
CONTRARY TO ALL PREVIOUS
THINKING ON THE SUBJECT,

31:01.166 --> 31:03.750
HUMAN BEINGS MAY
ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO REGROW BRAIN CELLS.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.166
SO I GUESS
THAT MEANS

31:06.166 --> 31:08.667
THE WHOLE "THIS IS
YOUR BRAIN ON DRUGS"
THING IS MOOT.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.041
I WOULDN'T GO
TOKING UP JUST YET...

31:12.542 --> 31:15.667
BUT I THINK WHAT IT MEANS
IS THAT AT SOME POINT

31:15.667 --> 31:17.708
IN THE NOT-SO-DISTANT
FUTURE,

31:17.708 --> 31:20.875
IT MAY ACTUALLY
BE POSSIBLE

31:20.875 --> 31:22.375
TO FORGET
ALL THE BAD STUFF

31:22.375 --> 31:24.417
AND ONLY REMEMBER
THE GOOD.

31:26.708 --> 31:27.834
I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU ASK ME,

31:27.834 --> 31:29.041
I THINK THAT'S
ALREADY POSSIBLE.

31:30.375 --> 31:34.083
SO TELL ME SOME MORE
ABOUT THIS NEW
ROOMMATE OF YOURS.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.375
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

31:38.375 --> 31:40.000
WELL, OF COURSE
I WANT TO KNOW.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.917
NO. I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR JOB
AND THIS BOAT.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.625
THIS IS ONE MOTHER
OF A BOAT, PACE.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.041
YEAH, I KNOW.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.834
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
TECHNICALLY MINE,

31:48.834 --> 31:50.875
BUT IT'S GOOD
FOR RIGHT NOW.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.875

THOSE ARE
MY COOKIES.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.667

DAD, I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M MAKING A MISTAKE,

33:04.917 --> 33:07.333
BUT IF I AM, IT'S
A MISTAKE I HAVE TO MAKE
FOR MYSELF, ALL RIGHT?

33:07.333 --> 33:09.667
AND I KNOW WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT THIS,

33:09.667 --> 33:12.458
YOU'RE GONNA REALIZE
I'M ONLY TRYING TO BE
THE KIND OF PERSON

33:12.458 --> 33:13.583
YOU TAUGHT ME TO BE.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.792
I THINK YOU ARE  MAKING
A MISTAKE, DAWSON,

33:15.792 --> 33:17.041
A HUGE MISTAKE,

33:17.041 --> 33:21.750

DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.708

BE HERE FOR YOU.

33:57.041 --> 33:59.333

NO, BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING IN HERE

AND STEALING CONDOMS

35:05.458 --> 35:07.166

38:21.834 --> 38:23.500
SLICE IT,
JUST LIKE THE POTATO.

38:27.959 --> 38:29.000
THAT'S NOT BAD.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.458
YOU'RE LEARNING.

38:30.458 --> 38:31.208
NOW WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT?

38:31.208 --> 38:35.291
BEHOLD
THE WHITE TRUFFLE--

38:35.291 --> 38:38.500
SO FRESH THAT
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE
THE LITTLE HOOF MARKS

38:38.500 --> 38:42.291
FROM THE PIG
THAT DUG IT OUT OF
THE I-TALIAN SOIL.

38:42.291 --> 38:46.250
THESE BABIES GO
FOR $1,200 A POUND.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.959
WHAT?

38:49.125 --> 38:50.875
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.291
NOW, IF I LET
SOME HEADSTRONG KID

38:53.291 --> 38:55.333
GET ANYWHERE NEAR THEM
WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING,

38:55.333 --> 38:59.250
I REALLY WOULD BE
A WACK JOB.

38:59.250 --> 38:59.625
TASTE.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.708
OK. I GET IT.

39:07.708 --> 39:11.375
KAREN HAS MORE
DISCIPLINE
AND MOTIVATION

39:11.375 --> 39:14.375

39:14.375 --> 39:17.708
BUT THIS ISN'T
KICK BOXING,

39:17.708 --> 39:20.041
AND THAT'S WHY
I WOULDN'T GIVE HER
YOUR JOB.

39:21.166 --> 39:23.750
HA HA HA!
SHE WANTED MY JOB.

39:23.750 --> 39:24.959
YEAH.

39:24.959 --> 39:27.166
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
PICK THIS UP
THROUGH SHEER WILL.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.333
COOKING IS A CRAFT

39:29.333 --> 39:30.750
WHICH CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.625
HOWEVER,

39:32.625 --> 39:33.500
IT CAN BE LEARNED.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.041
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

39:37.041 --> 39:39.083
CLEAN UP YOUR STATION.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.917

YOUR WEEKEND?

39:55.041 --> 39:56.166
STRANGE AND UNUSUAL.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.375
HOW ABOUT YOURS?

39:58.375 --> 40:00.750
STRANGE AND UNPLEASANT.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.333
YOU OK?

40:04.041 --> 40:05.083
NOT REALLY.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.375
I ALIENATED MY PARENTS,

40:07.375 --> 40:10.166
AND NOW I FIND MYSELF
ADRIFT IN A SEA
OF UNCERTAINTY.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.375
BUT, HEY, WHAT ELSE
IS NEW, RIGHT?

40:13.375 --> 40:16.625
CAN I DO
SOMETHING TO HELP?

40:16.625 --> 40:20.834
YEAH. YOU CAN TELL ME
THAT I, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
MADE THE RIGHT DECISION

40:20.834 --> 40:23.250
AND THAT THIS DECISION
WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT
POSITIVE REPERCUSSIONS

40:23.250 --> 40:24.834
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

40:24.834 --> 40:27.166
DAWSON, I CAN'T DO THAT.

40:28.291 --> 40:29.583
DAMN.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.458
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

40:32.458 --> 40:35.542
THERE IS NO
RIGHT OR WRONG,

40:35.542 --> 40:37.917
JUST CONSEQUENCES
OF YOUR ACTIONS.

40:40.291 --> 40:42.625
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

40:42.625 --> 40:44.708
WELL,
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY.

40:44.708 --> 40:47.959
MY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR
SAID THAT LAST WEEK,

40:47.959 --> 40:49.291
AND I THOUGHT IT
SOUNDED PRETTY PROFOUND
AT THE TIME.

40:49.291 --> 40:50.917
GREAT.

40:50.917 --> 40:52.625
I SHOULD JUST GET
ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW.

40:52.625 --> 40:55.417
WE CAN'T.
WE TRIED THAT ALREADY.

40:55.417 --> 40:57.250

YOU ON THAT PLANE.
