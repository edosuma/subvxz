00:00.891 --> 00:03.570
Agent Lee?
Olivia Dunham.

00:03.594 --> 00:05.067
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:05.068 --> 00:06.702
What division are you in?

00:06.770 --> 00:08.988
I am not leaving here
without some answers.

00:10.407 --> 00:12.875
Sometimes answers...
lead to more questions.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.415
The timeline
has been rewritten.

00:19.466 --> 00:20.716
He was erased,

00:20.784 --> 00:24.420
and yet traces of him
continue to bleed through.

00:24.471 --> 00:25.888
There was a man
in the mirror!

00:25.955 --> 00:27.623
He was here,
and then he was gone.

00:27.674 --> 00:29.392
I saw him!

00:29.459 --> 00:31.126
What's with the redecoration?

00:33.063 --> 00:34.981
- Aah!
<i>I'm here, Walter.</i>

00:35.065 --> 00:36.732
<i>Right here.</i>

00:36.800 --> 00:38.367
<i>Please, help me.</i>

00:44.691 --> 00:46.075
<i>Walter?</i>

00:47.611 --> 00:51.364
<i>You didn't answer</i>
<i>my question.</i>

00:51.448 --> 00:52.782
<i>I asked</i>

00:52.833 --> 00:54.950
if you've been keeping up
with the new medication

00:55.002 --> 00:56.285
I prescribed for you.

00:56.336 --> 00:58.754
Yes.

00:58.822 --> 01:01.323
For the most part.

01:01.375 --> 01:06.095
With my own modifications,
of course.

01:06.162 --> 01:07.430
Why?

01:07.497 --> 01:10.566
Well, you just seem
a little bit distracted.

01:10.634 --> 01:13.803
Well, yes...
as you ask.

01:13.854 --> 01:19.275
You've come at an extremely
inopportune time.

01:19.342 --> 01:21.894
I'm in the middle
of some very important work,

01:21.978 --> 01:23.679
and I'm anxious to resume.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.281
I appreciate that,
Walter.

01:25.348 --> 01:28.451
But these monthly evaluations
are also important.

01:28.518 --> 01:29.452
Well, yes, I know.

01:29.519 --> 01:31.454
It was a condition
you imposed

01:31.521 --> 01:33.039
on my release
from St. Claire's.

01:33.123 --> 01:34.990
I mean personally
important.

01:35.058 --> 01:37.376
You were under my care
there for...

01:37.444 --> 01:39.779
most of your 17 years.

01:39.846 --> 01:43.132
These sessions allow me
to catch up with you,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.384
see how you're doing.

01:45.469 --> 01:47.053
Now...

01:47.137 --> 01:49.204
I've been perusing the latest
observational reports

01:49.256 --> 01:50.923
from the agents
assigned to you,

01:51.007 --> 01:56.195
and they mention certain
patterns of unusual behavior.

01:56.263 --> 02:00.032
Well, o-occasionally, I have
a unique way of doing things

02:00.100 --> 02:01.183
which can be misinterpret--

02:01.234 --> 02:02.852
Tell me about the mirrors.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.820
Mirrors?

02:04.888 --> 02:07.056
And the television?

02:07.124 --> 02:11.060
Virtually every reflective
surface in and around your lab

02:11.128 --> 02:13.245
has been covered
or obscured by you.

02:15.949 --> 02:18.734
Naturally,
I covered them up.

02:20.654 --> 02:22.237
I-it's an experiment
I'm conducting on--

02:22.289 --> 02:25.574
So this had nothing to do
with your lab being haunted.

02:25.625 --> 02:26.876
Beg your pardon?

02:26.927 --> 02:27.960
According to the report,

02:28.044 --> 02:30.463
you claimed on more than
one occasion

02:30.547 --> 02:33.716
to have seen a strange man
in the lab,

02:33.767 --> 02:35.601
a man no one else has seen,

02:35.685 --> 02:37.720
and that sometimes...

02:37.771 --> 02:39.588
the man speaks to you.

02:40.757 --> 02:42.942
Oh...

02:43.026 --> 02:45.928
just minor hallucinations,
of course,

02:45.979 --> 02:49.281
by my self-medication.

02:49.366 --> 02:52.067
That was weeks ago.
I-I'm much better now.

02:52.119 --> 02:55.871
So you haven't had any more
of these hallucinations since?

03:00.043 --> 03:01.777
No.

03:03.997 --> 03:06.799
Walter, it is important

03:06.883 --> 03:09.301
that you be completely
honest with me

03:09.386 --> 03:12.838
so that I can make an assessment
of your state of mind

03:12.923 --> 03:16.926
and I can make recommendations
for your continued care...

03:16.977 --> 03:19.461
Whatever that may be.

03:30.357 --> 03:32.358
You're dead, Sneddon.
You hear me?

03:32.442 --> 03:34.660
<i>You better run, rat!</i>

03:40.534 --> 03:43.202
<i>We're gonna beat your ass!</i>

03:52.212 --> 03:53.996
<i>Wait up a minute, man.</i>

03:54.047 --> 03:55.631
<i>You run like</i>
<i>a little girl.</i>

03:55.682 --> 03:57.132
<i>Keep up.</i>
<i>We got him now.</i>

03:57.184 --> 03:58.217
<i>He went in there.</i>

03:58.301 --> 03:59.435
Oh, he's like so dead.

03:59.502 --> 04:00.803
There he is.

04:03.723 --> 04:06.809
Picked a bad place
to hide, dumb ass.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.394
Just leave me alone, guys.

04:08.478 --> 04:09.478
Or what?

04:09.529 --> 04:12.031
I know it was you,
you little freak.

04:12.115 --> 04:14.567
You got me busted
for the stash in my locker.

04:14.651 --> 04:15.901
Come on, Matt.
Kick his ass.

04:19.656 --> 04:21.040
You had this coming...

04:21.124 --> 04:22.408
<i>Uh...something</i>
<i>touched my leg!</i>

04:22.492 --> 04:25.193
It's probably
just a bug or something.

04:25.245 --> 04:26.962
Tough it out.

04:27.030 --> 04:28.464
<i>Dude, what is this?</i>

04:28.531 --> 04:30.249
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

Something like that.
Mm-hmm.

05:30.093 --> 05:32.728
Hmm. I got, uh, word

05:32.779 --> 05:34.129
you wanted to see me?

05:34.197 --> 05:36.699
We get any news on
the shape shifter attack?

05:36.766 --> 05:38.734
Uh, no. I just wanted
to check in with you,

05:38.785 --> 05:41.120
see how you're handling
everything.

05:41.204 --> 05:43.038
I know you've been going
through the case files,

05:43.106 --> 05:44.406
getting up to speed.

05:44.457 --> 05:48.110
I understand that it
can be kind of overwhelming.

05:48.161 --> 05:51.080
It's hard when what you knew

05:51.131 --> 05:53.549
or what you thought you knew
about the world...

05:53.616 --> 05:55.834
no longer holds.

05:55.919 --> 05:58.620
And I just wanted you
to know that I'm here.

05:58.672 --> 06:01.307
You're...

06:01.391 --> 06:03.592
Here?

06:03.643 --> 06:06.061
Yeah.

06:06.129 --> 06:07.763
To talk to, you know?

06:07.814 --> 06:10.816
I mean, just if things
are getting a little too much

06:10.900 --> 06:12.818
or if you're freaked out...

06:12.902 --> 06:14.803
I'm...not freaked out.

06:16.906 --> 06:19.158
Oh.

06:19.242 --> 06:22.361
Good.

06:22.445 --> 06:23.912
Okay.

06:23.980 --> 06:24.947
Well,
you just let me know.

06:24.998 --> 06:27.783
If I freak out, I--
yeah, you...

06:27.834 --> 06:29.368
you'll be the first
to know.

06:31.037 --> 06:33.339
Dunham.

06:40.663 --> 06:41.997
<i>We've got two bodies.</i>

06:43.383 --> 06:45.267
12-year-old boys.

06:45.334 --> 06:47.102
How many months
since they've been missing?

06:47.170 --> 06:50.222
<i>Not months. Hours.</i>
<i>Somewhere between 10 and 15,</i>

06:50.306 --> 06:52.024
according to the reports
their families made

06:52.108 --> 06:53.442
when they didn't
come home last night.

06:53.509 --> 06:55.343
<i>Agent Broyles?</i>

06:55.395 --> 06:57.012
<i>Agent Farnsworth</i>
<i>is ready for you.</i>

06:59.682 --> 07:01.483
<i>Has Dr. Bishop come up</i>
<i>with any theories yet</i>

07:01.534 --> 07:02.684
on cause of death

07:02.736 --> 07:05.287
or the bodies' advanced
state of decomposition?

07:05.354 --> 07:06.905
Walter, Agent Broyles
wants to know if--

07:06.990 --> 07:08.190
<i>Yes, yes, I heard him.</i>

07:08.241 --> 07:11.326
Will you tell Agent <i>Broyles</i>

07:11.378 --> 07:14.663
that as there appears to be
no unusual environmental factors

07:14.714 --> 07:17.699
to explain
the rapid deterioration,

07:17.751 --> 07:20.302
<i>that it is absurd for me</i>
<i>to make any determination</i>

07:20.370 --> 07:22.254
<i>without first examining</i>
<i>the remainders!</i>

07:22.338 --> 07:23.839
Okay, Walter said he--

07:23.890 --> 07:25.090
<i>tell him, for all I know,</i>
<i>it could be viral</i>

07:25.175 --> 07:27.976
or a mutation of some
flesh-eating bacteria.

07:28.044 --> 07:29.511
He thinks that--

07:29.562 --> 07:31.180
some kind of alien parasite

07:31.231 --> 07:32.815
<i>or...Bigfoot.</i>

07:32.882 --> 07:34.650
Bigfoot!
That's it.

07:34.717 --> 07:36.384
<i>Astrid, perhaps</i>
<i>you can look around</i>

07:36.436 --> 07:38.771
<i>for massive fecal droppings,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

07:38.855 --> 07:42.691
He doesn't have
any theories, sir.

07:42.742 --> 07:45.194
<i>I think I got something.</i>

07:45.245 --> 07:48.914
There's a third set
of sneaker treads leading in...

07:48.998 --> 07:50.449
and then out.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.868
Size 7, 8, maybe.

07:52.919 --> 07:54.569
Then we have
a potential witness.

07:54.621 --> 07:56.071
Or another victim.

07:56.122 --> 07:58.006
<i>Even if there was</i>
<i>another boy that got away,</i>

07:58.074 --> 08:00.793
he could still be infected by
whatever killed the other two.

08:00.877 --> 08:03.545
Point taken.
We need to find him fast.

08:03.596 --> 08:06.548
Yeah. If he's alive.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.737
Oh!

08:14.788 --> 08:17.688
Remarkably pungent stench.

08:17.689 --> 08:21.007
I'm gonna...
get some scented candles.

08:21.059 --> 08:23.277
<i>Agent Broyles.</i>

08:23.344 --> 08:25.646
It was good of you
to accompany Astrid,

08:25.697 --> 08:27.397
although unnecessary.

08:27.482 --> 08:28.865
Agents Dunham and Lee

08:28.950 --> 08:31.952
are tracking down the identity
of the boy who fled the scene.

08:32.019 --> 08:33.352
I thought I'd take
the opportunity

08:33.404 --> 08:34.988
to check in on you.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.957
Oh...How nice.

08:37.024 --> 08:39.058
May I ask why?

08:39.126 --> 08:41.912
You had your evaluation
with Dr. Sumner last night.

08:41.996 --> 08:44.831
He called me afterwards
to voice some concerns.

08:44.882 --> 08:46.033
Concerns?

08:46.100 --> 08:48.034
He thought you seemed
unusually agitated

08:48.086 --> 08:50.537
by something you were
reluctant to confide.

08:50.588 --> 08:54.174
I-I can't imagine what
gave him that impress--

08:54.225 --> 08:55.759
<i>Walter?</i>

08:55.843 --> 08:57.477
Where's the second body?

08:57.545 --> 08:59.062
On its way to the morgue.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.481
I assumed one was sufficient
for your examination.

09:01.549 --> 09:03.183
Not--not sufficient
at all.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.018
I-it's quite the opposite.

09:05.069 --> 09:06.886
I need both bodies.

09:06.938 --> 09:08.054
<i>Walter.</i> What?

09:08.106 --> 09:09.690
What?

09:11.859 --> 09:13.026
Did you say something?

09:13.077 --> 09:15.228
I asked why you need
both bodies.

09:15.279 --> 09:17.080
Because--

09:17.165 --> 09:19.566
<i>Walter, listen to me.</i>

09:20.952 --> 09:23.036
<i>Walter, do you see me?</i>

09:23.087 --> 09:24.871
Only by...Comparison...
<i>Walter, I can hear you.</i>

09:24.922 --> 09:26.673
Will I be able to determine...
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:26.741 --> 09:29.543
<i>If there are patterns</i>
<i>to the decomposition</i>

09:29.594 --> 09:30.794
of the tissue...

09:30.878 --> 09:32.295
<i>Listen...</i>

09:32.380 --> 09:36.016
Or the putrefaction
of the internal organs,

09:36.083 --> 09:38.051
it may well be
that the victims

09:38.102 --> 09:39.770
perished at
different intervals.

09:39.854 --> 09:40.920
Dr. Bishop.

09:40.972 --> 09:42.589
And one of them
may be a carrier!

09:42.640 --> 09:44.808
<i>I want to come home.</i>
I am not losing my mind!

10:00.074 --> 10:01.658
I would appreciate you

10:01.743 --> 10:04.611
arranging to have
the second remains

10:04.662 --> 10:07.280
sent here
as soon as possible.

10:07.331 --> 10:08.799
Excuse me.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.141
Broyles.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.976
<i>It's Olivia. We have a lead</i>
<i>on the third boy.</i>

10:20.061 --> 10:21.728
<i>This morning another student</i>
<i>told the principal</i>

10:21.796 --> 10:23.563
<i>that the two victims</i>
<i>had been talking about plans</i>

10:23.631 --> 10:25.232
<i>to beat a kid up.</i>

10:44.786 --> 10:48.154
His name is Aaron Sneddon.
He's ten years old.

10:48.206 --> 10:49.489
He said
it was pretty dark

10:49.540 --> 10:50.824
and he didn't see much
after the boys chased him

10:50.875 --> 10:52.092
into the tunnel.

10:52.159 --> 10:53.593
Why didn't he tell anyone
what happened?

10:53.661 --> 10:54.761
His parents?

10:54.829 --> 10:56.012
Well, he has no father,

10:56.097 --> 10:57.297
and his mother
is out of the country.

10:57.348 --> 10:58.598
Aaron said
that she's away a lot

10:58.666 --> 11:00.016
for work.

11:00.101 --> 11:01.351
But the boy's mother wouldn't
leave him home by himself.

11:01.436 --> 11:02.686
No, she has him stay
with a neighbor

11:02.770 --> 11:04.438
in their
apartment complex.

11:04.505 --> 11:06.790
His principal said
that he's a quiet boy,

11:06.858 --> 11:09.192
that she doesn't know him
to have many friends.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.528
So has Walter
gotten anywhere yet?

11:11.612 --> 11:14.231
Beyond his random theories
of vampires and succubi, no.

11:14.315 --> 11:16.349
<i>He says he needs to examine</i>
<i>the other body.</i>

11:16.417 --> 11:18.618
I'd like you and Agent Lee
to retrieve it from the morgue.

11:18.686 --> 11:20.520
I'll let Dr. Bishop
know the boy is here.

11:20.571 --> 11:21.738
Okay.

11:33.751 --> 11:35.635
<i>You like to draw?</i>

11:38.422 --> 11:40.423
Me too.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.381
Aaron, we're going to have
to get you checked out

11:48.432 --> 11:49.983
to make sure
that you're okay.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.319
<i>Our friend, Dr. Bishop,</i>
<i>is going to examine you.</i>

11:52.386 --> 11:54.554
I don't like doctors.

11:54.605 --> 11:56.222
They scare me.

11:56.274 --> 11:57.891
Oh, you'll like Walter.

11:57.942 --> 11:59.526
There's nothing scary
about him.

11:59.577 --> 12:01.528
All right, young man.
Let's get started.

12:01.579 --> 12:04.948
Take off your shirt
and hop on the table.

12:11.906 --> 12:13.924
Please,
I don't want a shot.

12:15.793 --> 12:17.794
Well, technically a shot

12:17.879 --> 12:20.630
is depositing a substance
into the bloodstream.

12:20.715 --> 12:22.299
This is more
a withdrawal.

12:25.770 --> 12:28.889
Just this one time.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.590
I promise.

12:46.207 --> 12:49.409
There.
That wasn't so bad.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.127
Good boy.

12:53.581 --> 12:55.298
You can put
your shirt on now.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.783
I'll be right back.

13:22.493 --> 13:24.277
<i>Please, don't touch that!</i>

13:24.328 --> 13:26.496
Give me...

13:33.254 --> 13:35.505
It's all right.
It's all right.

13:35.590 --> 13:39.426
I--I shouldn't
have shouted.

13:41.095 --> 13:43.997
It--it belonged
to my son.

13:45.099 --> 13:46.883
You have a son?

13:46.968 --> 13:48.635
I did.

13:50.337 --> 13:52.472
He died.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.862
<i>Walter.</i>

13:58.946 --> 14:01.514
You need to come
and take a look at this.

14:09.523 --> 14:10.857
What is it?

14:10.908 --> 14:13.660
It happened when
I was moving a candle.

14:18.132 --> 14:20.033
That's curious.

14:20.084 --> 14:21.551
Yeah.

14:21.636 --> 14:23.887
Look at the lambda sensor.

14:28.092 --> 14:29.759
The corpse is pulling
high levels of oxygen

14:29.844 --> 14:31.761
out of the air.

14:32.813 --> 14:35.348
Astrid...

14:35.399 --> 14:38.184
I don't remember there
being this much mold

14:38.235 --> 14:40.070
<i>on the ribcage before.</i>

14:45.409 --> 14:46.526
Dear God.

14:46.577 --> 14:49.228
The incubation case.
Quickly!

14:49.280 --> 14:51.748
Grab the other end.
We have to contain it.

14:51.832 --> 14:52.899
Walter.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.584
No time to explain.
Hurry!

15:04.628 --> 15:06.296
Spores.

15:07.798 --> 15:09.749
I--I had assumed
that the mold

15:09.800 --> 15:12.769
was just a symptom of
the rapid decomposition.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.270
Walter,
I am not following.

15:14.355 --> 15:16.189
The cause, Astrid...

15:17.391 --> 15:18.641
I'm starting to believe

15:18.726 --> 15:21.594
that it was
an aggressive form of fungi

15:21.645 --> 15:23.396
that killed the boys.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.781
Olivia and Lincoln,
they went to the morgue

15:24.865 --> 15:26.649
to get the other body.

15:30.955 --> 15:32.205
Astrid?

15:32.272 --> 15:33.540
Are you at the morgue?

15:33.607 --> 15:34.958
<i>Yeah, we're just heading</i>
<i>to the elevator now--</i>

15:35.042 --> 15:36.626
listen, you have got
to evacuate the room.

15:36.711 --> 15:38.611
Get the body from the tunnel
locked down.

15:38.662 --> 15:40.279
What?

15:40.331 --> 15:42.448
<i>It's going to explode</i>
<i>and release spores!</i>

15:47.788 --> 15:49.723
<i>You gonna get that?</i>

15:49.790 --> 15:51.224
I'm eating my lunch.

15:52.593 --> 15:54.293
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

16:06.907 --> 16:07.974
Hey, Beth, come here.

16:08.025 --> 16:10.193
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

16:11.996 --> 16:13.696
Oh, God.

16:18.485 --> 16:19.702
What are you doing?

16:19.787 --> 16:21.037
We gotta get them
out of there.

16:21.122 --> 16:22.372
We can't open that door.

16:22.456 --> 16:23.840
We need to get a team in here
and lock down the area.

16:23.924 --> 16:26.259
We can't just
leave 'em to die.

16:26.326 --> 16:28.445
They're already dead.

16:55.309 --> 16:56.626
Dr. Bishop.

16:56.677 --> 16:59.980
<i>Can you tell us what</i>
<i>we're dealing with here?</i>

17:00.064 --> 17:03.316
Clearly not
the garden variety

17:03.401 --> 17:04.851
of cordyceps fungi.

17:04.935 --> 17:06.987
<i>A genetic mutation</i>
<i>with a capacity</i>

17:07.070 --> 17:10.607
<i>of hyper-accelerated growth</i>
<i>and nutrition absorption,</i>

17:10.657 --> 17:13.042
<i>which explains</i>
<i>the rapid decomposition</i>

17:13.109 --> 17:14.377
<i>of the bodies.</i>

17:14.444 --> 17:16.945
Walter, what's
"cordyceps fungi"?

17:16.998 --> 17:19.249
A species capable
of releasing neurotoxins

17:19.316 --> 17:21.150
so as to paralyze a host,

17:21.202 --> 17:23.152
usually an insect,

17:23.204 --> 17:27.156
so that the fungi can feed
and lay its spores.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.540
So why aren't they
attacking us?

17:28.626 --> 17:31.211
<i>These are not a pack</i>
<i>of wolves, Agent Broyles.</i>

17:31.295 --> 17:32.595
Size not withstanding,

17:32.663 --> 17:33.880
they are still
a lower life form

17:33.964 --> 17:36.433
with rudimentary instincts

17:36.500 --> 17:38.668
probably based on
tactile response.

17:38.719 --> 17:40.503
As long as none of you
touch them,

17:40.554 --> 17:42.305
they won't even know
you're there.

17:42.356 --> 17:43.673
A couple
of these bad boys

17:43.724 --> 17:45.859
are making their way
down the sink.

17:45.943 --> 17:48.862
<i>Most likely seeking</i>
<i>more water and nutrients,</i>

17:48.946 --> 17:50.530
which shows
a strong impulse

17:50.614 --> 17:53.516
to expand their reach
as far as possible.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.518
<i>I mean, really, this is</i>
<i>a most extraordinary species,</i>

17:55.569 --> 17:56.653
<i>don't you think?</i>

17:56.704 --> 17:58.187
Admiration aside,
Dr. Bishop,

17:58.239 --> 17:59.656
how do you recommend
killing these things?

17:59.707 --> 18:02.375
<i>As with a great many</i>
<i>molds and fungi,</i>

18:02.460 --> 18:06.496
<i>a strong dose of U.V. light</i>
<i>or intense heat</i>

18:06.547 --> 18:09.031
should effectively
eradicate them.

18:10.334 --> 18:11.634
<i>Understood.</i>

18:11.702 --> 18:13.803
Agent Mace,
this is Broyles.

18:13.871 --> 18:14.921
We're going to need

18:15.005 --> 18:16.139
<i>high-intensity</i>
<i>U.V. lamps in here,</i>

18:16.206 --> 18:17.373
<i>as many as you can find.</i>

18:17.425 --> 18:19.208
<i>Yes, sir. Copy that.</i>

18:19.260 --> 18:20.643
I'll oversee things here.

18:20.711 --> 18:22.729
<i>I want you and Agent Lee</i>
<i>to assemble a small team</i>

18:22.813 --> 18:24.064
and have them meet you
at the tunnel.

18:24.148 --> 18:25.265
<i>Based on</i>
<i>the boy's remains,</i>

18:25.349 --> 18:26.566
<i>the fungus colony</i>
<i>at the tunnel</i>

18:26.650 --> 18:29.385
is probably much bigger
than what we have here.

18:29.437 --> 18:30.653
I'm not convinced

18:30.721 --> 18:32.105
that U.V. is
the most efficient way

18:32.189 --> 18:33.256
to destroy it.

18:33.324 --> 18:34.908
You have something else
in mind?

18:34.992 --> 18:37.277
I'm thinking
flamethrowers.

18:37.361 --> 18:40.280
Fortunately,
your tests show no sign

18:40.364 --> 18:42.949
of fungal infection.

18:43.033 --> 18:44.868
The good news
is that you're now free

18:44.919 --> 18:46.235
to return home.

18:46.287 --> 18:49.756
Agent Farnsworth
will drop you there.

18:53.594 --> 18:55.295
Unless it's not good news.

18:55.379 --> 18:57.881
Nobody's there.

18:57.932 --> 19:00.934
Oh, yes. I understand
you're staying with a friend.

19:01.018 --> 19:04.387
A neighbor, but she
never talks to me.

19:04.455 --> 19:07.223
Perhaps there's someone else
with whom you can stay.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.759
No.

19:09.827 --> 19:12.445
I see.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.130
Well, I certainly know
what it feels like

19:14.198 --> 19:15.565
to have nowhere to go,

19:15.633 --> 19:17.784
no family.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.404
This is the only home
I know.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.241
You live here?

19:25.292 --> 19:27.494
Yeah.

19:27.578 --> 19:31.080
It's not much,
I admit, but...

19:31.165 --> 19:33.249
It's certainly better
than the mental institution

19:33.300 --> 19:36.252
where I lived before this.

19:48.098 --> 19:50.066
Would you like
to stay here with me

19:50.133 --> 19:52.519
for a little while
longer?

19:54.572 --> 19:56.990
I can't promise that
I'll have any time

19:57.074 --> 19:59.325
for entertaining you,
understand.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.778
I mean,
I'm a very busy man.

20:13.674 --> 20:18.661
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
Sublime.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.431
Dr. Bishop.

20:21.498 --> 20:23.933
"Walter." I said you
could call me "Walter."

20:26.687 --> 20:28.471
How did your son die?

20:37.264 --> 20:39.866
Peter was very sick.

20:41.869 --> 20:45.305
I tried for a long time
to find a cure...

20:45.372 --> 20:47.323
but I found it
too late,

20:47.374 --> 20:49.025
and he died.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.715
Then I discovered
an alternate Universe

20:55.799 --> 20:57.867
where another version
of my son was dying

20:57.918 --> 20:59.502
from the same malady.

21:00.838 --> 21:02.639
So I crossed over
to the other side

21:02.706 --> 21:04.373
with the intention
of bringing him back

21:04.425 --> 21:06.142
to cure him.

21:07.895 --> 21:09.045
But the frozen lake

21:09.096 --> 21:11.147
where I created a portal
between Universes

21:11.214 --> 21:12.815
was unsound,

21:12.883 --> 21:15.535
and when we crossed back,

21:15.603 --> 21:17.887
the ice broke.

21:17.938 --> 21:20.723
And Peter--

21:20.774 --> 21:23.426
the other version
of him--drowned.

21:24.662 --> 21:26.996
And I lost him
all over again.

21:30.584 --> 21:34.120
And...you don't
think you belong

21:34.204 --> 21:37.206
in a mental institution?

21:52.056 --> 21:53.640
How soon till
the flood lights are up?

21:53.724 --> 21:55.275
Almost there, ma'am.

21:58.362 --> 22:00.280
Here's our perp.

22:00.364 --> 22:02.932
Doesn't look
like much in here.

22:02.983 --> 22:04.400
No wonder
we overlooked it.

22:04.451 --> 22:05.768
Well, once
we've got lights,

22:05.819 --> 22:07.070
we can make sure
we've taken out

22:07.121 --> 22:08.788
the entire colony.

22:12.910 --> 22:16.546
<i>Watch your step.</i>

22:16.614 --> 22:19.132
<i>There could be</i>
<i>something there.</i>

22:24.471 --> 22:26.472
Ready for you,
Agent Dunham.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.902
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready for another.

22:42.639 --> 22:44.107
Aaron, what's wrong?

22:44.158 --> 22:47.110
It's...bright.

22:47.161 --> 22:48.661
What?

22:48.746 --> 22:50.446
It's too bright.

22:51.782 --> 22:53.199
What do you see?

22:53.283 --> 22:56.452
I need the handheld
flood over here.

23:06.213 --> 23:08.831
There's more of it
back here.

23:08.882 --> 23:10.717
A lot more.

23:10.801 --> 23:12.135
What is that?

23:12.186 --> 23:14.053
Let me take a look--

23:14.138 --> 23:16.672
No! Get away!
What is it?

23:16.724 --> 23:19.175
Some of it's growing down
through some grating.

23:19.226 --> 23:20.342
Do we know what's under here?

23:22.646 --> 23:24.113
Burn it.

23:24.181 --> 23:25.948
Burn it all.

23:26.984 --> 23:28.184
Astrid! Help me!

23:28.235 --> 23:30.186
Aaron, you need
to talk to me.

23:30.237 --> 23:31.738
You need to tell me
what's wrong.

23:31.822 --> 23:33.072
Walter, he has
a high-grade fever.

23:33.157 --> 23:34.574
How'd this happen?
I don't know.

23:34.658 --> 23:36.743
He was complaining about
something being too bright,

23:36.827 --> 23:38.244
and then he got scared,

23:38.328 --> 23:40.663
and then he just
started burning--

23:54.261 --> 23:55.595
Walter?

23:55.679 --> 23:57.980
<i>Stop what you're doing.</i>

23:58.048 --> 23:59.315
Say it again.

23:59.382 --> 24:01.684
I said stop it!
You're killing the boy.

24:08.927 --> 24:10.595
Just a few more minutes.

24:10.679 --> 24:13.598
I don't want to turn you
into a popsicle.

24:13.682 --> 24:14.932
Oh, Astrid--

24:15.017 --> 24:16.267
I'll get you one
later, Walter.

24:16.352 --> 24:18.219
Oh. Grape,
please.

24:18.270 --> 24:20.388
And one for
my friend here.

24:22.024 --> 24:23.941
You just rest there.

24:25.778 --> 24:28.029
<i>Olivia.</i>

24:28.080 --> 24:29.030
We've managed to bring
his temperature down

24:29.081 --> 24:30.481
a couple of degrees,

24:30.549 --> 24:31.833
<i>but it remains</i>
<i>dangerously high.</i>

24:31.900 --> 24:33.334
And you're positive
that Aaron was affected

24:33.402 --> 24:34.919
by the fungus
<i>in</i> the tunnel?

24:35.003 --> 24:36.737
<i>His collapse</i>
<i>and fever coincided</i>

24:36.789 --> 24:40.508
precisely as you were,
uh, burning the colony.

24:40.575 --> 24:41.709
<i>I am certain there</i>
<i>was a connection.</i>

24:41.760 --> 24:42.710
<i>Okay, what about the fungus</i>

24:42.761 --> 24:43.711
at the morgue?

24:43.762 --> 24:45.630
Broyles and his team
destroyed that.

24:45.714 --> 24:47.131
<i>Why wasn't Aaron</i>
<i>affected then?</i>

24:47.216 --> 24:49.750
Well, that I cannot
explain as of yet.

24:49.802 --> 24:53.554
So the boy is feeling

24:53.605 --> 24:54.889
whatever this thing

24:54.940 --> 24:56.224
<i>inside the tunnel</i>
<i>is feeling.</i>

24:56.275 --> 24:57.442
<i>Precisely.</i>

24:57.526 --> 24:58.776
Okay, whatever it is,
it's dangerous,

24:58.861 --> 25:00.111
and we need
to destroy it.

25:00.195 --> 25:01.446
So how do we break
the connection

25:01.530 --> 25:02.447
between it
and the boy?

25:02.531 --> 25:03.481
<i>I'm not sure,</i>

25:03.565 --> 25:05.366
but perhaps the best way
to determine that

25:05.434 --> 25:06.651
is to learn

25:06.735 --> 25:08.703
<i>how the connection was formed</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

25:08.770 --> 25:11.439
Okay, well, I think I may
have an idea about that.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.047
Aaron,
let's have a talk.

25:20.115 --> 25:22.049
About what?

25:22.117 --> 25:23.951
About why you lied
to us.

25:28.107 --> 25:29.957
Your drawings, Aaron.

25:30.008 --> 25:31.625
Agent Dunham found them
covering the wall

25:31.677 --> 25:33.511
inside the tunnel.

25:36.265 --> 25:37.765
You never mentioned

25:37.816 --> 25:39.934
you'd been there
before yesterday.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.689
Based on the size
of your artwork,

25:44.773 --> 25:46.824
I'd say you
go there a lot.

25:49.445 --> 25:51.245
It, um...

25:53.365 --> 25:55.349
It's hard to explain.

25:57.836 --> 26:01.706
I would go there
sometimes.

26:01.790 --> 26:03.558
<i>To get away.</i>

26:03.625 --> 26:04.759
<i>And after a while,</i>

26:04.826 --> 26:09.046
I would...

26:09.131 --> 26:11.966
start to feel better,

26:12.017 --> 26:15.803
like I wasn't alone,

26:15.854 --> 26:18.890
that there was
something there

26:18.974 --> 26:21.893
that was sad
whenever I was sad.

26:21.977 --> 26:23.811
Or...

26:26.031 --> 26:28.533
I know it sounds stupid.

26:28.617 --> 26:30.568
<i>Perhaps not.</i>

26:30.652 --> 26:33.070
You're saying you thought
there was something there

26:33.155 --> 26:35.122
that felt as you felt.

26:36.742 --> 26:40.228
I mean, I guess I thought
I was just imagining it.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.833
Maybe I was crazy.

26:47.719 --> 26:50.538
But it was like
it understood me,

26:50.589 --> 26:52.006
like it wanted
to protect--

26:52.057 --> 26:53.891
protect you.

26:58.397 --> 27:01.849
Aaron, the boys who
were chasing you...

27:03.352 --> 27:05.719
You intentionally
led them there, didn't you?

27:08.056 --> 27:11.192
It told you to bring them
back to the tunnel.

27:11.243 --> 27:13.911
I didn't know what
was gonna happen,

27:13.996 --> 27:15.279
I swear.

27:15.364 --> 27:18.732
I didn't know
what it was!

27:28.677 --> 27:30.378
It's all right, son.

27:33.632 --> 27:37.018
Shh...

27:40.755 --> 27:43.090
I believe you did
nothing wrong.

27:49.481 --> 27:52.366
Walter...

27:52.434 --> 27:54.652
What was that
all about?

27:54.736 --> 27:55.987
I don't understand.

27:56.071 --> 27:59.106
I think I'm beginning to.
I need Agent Dunham.

28:01.293 --> 28:04.445
My initial hypothesis
was entirely wrong.

28:04.496 --> 28:07.415
These are not colonies
of fungi.

28:07.466 --> 28:09.216
I now believe that--

28:09.284 --> 28:13.454
that this is
a single organism,

28:13.505 --> 28:16.223
one with rapidly evolving
communication skills,

28:16.291 --> 28:18.426
enabling it to form
a psychic bond

28:18.477 --> 28:20.261
with the boy.

28:20.312 --> 28:23.848
You see these?
I believe that each of these

28:23.932 --> 28:25.349
fungal masses
is the equivalent

28:25.434 --> 28:27.101
to a neuron,
a brain cell,

28:27.152 --> 28:30.571
and these tendrils
are linking them together,

28:30.639 --> 28:32.907
essentially dendrites
and synapses.

28:32.974 --> 28:37.278
The organism
is a vast neural network.

28:37.329 --> 28:38.279
Wait, you're telling me
that this whole thing,

28:38.330 --> 28:40.648
all of it,
is one big giant brain?

28:40.699 --> 28:42.283
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

28:42.334 --> 28:44.418
Agent Lee,
Gus is a growing,

28:44.486 --> 28:46.704
evolving mind.

28:46.788 --> 28:48.155
"Gus"?

28:48.206 --> 28:50.207
Well, I thought that since
it's a single living entity

28:50.292 --> 28:51.492
that perhaps
we should name it

28:51.543 --> 28:52.710
for the sake of clarity.

28:52.794 --> 28:54.045
Okay, so the reason
that Aaron wasn't affected

28:54.129 --> 28:56.213
when we destroyed
the fungi in the morgue--

28:56.298 --> 28:59.634
was because the colony
growing there

28:59.685 --> 29:01.302
was unable to connect
to the network,

29:01.353 --> 29:04.171
and until it could,
it was a mindless appendage.

29:04.222 --> 29:05.890
<i>That's why it was</i>
<i>heading down the drain--</i>

29:05.974 --> 29:07.608
to try and connect
with Gus.

29:07.676 --> 29:10.177
Yeah. What you need
to understand is that

29:10.228 --> 29:11.812
Gus can only
make more of itself.

29:11.863 --> 29:13.898
And as it grows,
it becomes more intelligent,

29:13.982 --> 29:16.567
more self-aware,
and ever more conscious

29:16.652 --> 29:18.819
of how alone
in the world it is.

29:18.870 --> 29:20.237
And my contention

29:20.322 --> 29:22.406
is that Gus

29:22.491 --> 29:25.242
forged a link
with Aaron

29:25.327 --> 29:27.161
over this shared sense
of isolation.

29:27.212 --> 29:29.029
Until I can find a way

29:29.081 --> 29:30.915
to break the link
with the boy,

29:30.999 --> 29:32.667
any assault
on the organism

29:32.718 --> 29:34.335
will hurt him.

29:34.386 --> 29:36.504
Or worse.

29:43.878 --> 29:45.930
It's Broyles.

29:46.014 --> 29:47.598
Sir, we have new information
about the fungus.

29:47.683 --> 29:48.766
<i>So have I.</i>

29:48.850 --> 29:50.985
<i>There's been</i>
<i>another attack--</i>

29:51.052 --> 29:52.886
a homeless man camped out
in an alley in Roxbury Crossing.

29:52.938 --> 29:55.356
Looks like the fungus
came up through some grating.

29:55.407 --> 29:56.754
Roxbury? That's six miles
from the tunnel.

29:56.779 --> 29:57.908
<i>I know.</i>

29:57.909 --> 29:59.694
After Agent Lee's report
on the growths in the tunnel,

29:59.745 --> 30:01.028
I found that
the Boston sewer line

30:01.079 --> 30:03.364
runs directly
underneath that area.

30:03.415 --> 30:04.732
We have a major infestation
on our hands.

30:04.783 --> 30:06.534
<i>We need</i>
<i>to eradicate this thing,</i>

30:06.585 --> 30:07.835
<i>and we need to do it now.</i>

30:07.902 --> 30:09.503
Agent Broyles, uh,
this is Walter Bishop.

30:09.571 --> 30:12.373
I--I don't think
you--you--you understand

30:12.424 --> 30:13.841
<i>that I haven't yet</i>
<i>discovered a way</i>

30:13.908 --> 30:15.626
<i>to break the link between</i>
<i>the organism and the boy.</i>

30:15.711 --> 30:16.744
I--I need more time.

30:16.795 --> 30:17.745
<i>I do understand, doctor.</i>

30:17.796 --> 30:18.963
Believe me.

30:19.047 --> 30:20.464
But the longer we wait,
the more likely

30:20.549 --> 30:21.915
other innocent people
will be killed.

30:21.967 --> 30:23.300
It's just that
you are not hearing me.

30:23.385 --> 30:24.969
<i>I suggest you keep trying</i>
<i>with whatever time--</i>

30:25.053 --> 30:27.254
he'll die!
Do you hear me?

30:27.305 --> 30:29.523
You're going
to kill Peter!

30:31.560 --> 30:33.027
Aaron.

30:34.229 --> 30:36.096
Walter,
you mean "Aaron."

30:36.148 --> 30:37.815
What did I say?

30:37.899 --> 30:39.316
<i>You've got two hours,</i>
<i>Dr. Bishop.</i>

30:39.401 --> 30:40.985
After that or if there
are any more attacks,

30:41.069 --> 30:42.703
I can't make any promises.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.457
Astrid, we need
to reconfigure

30:46.541 --> 30:48.626
the neurostimulator
for magnetic resonance!

30:48.710 --> 30:50.377
We need to chart
Aaron's brain activity.

30:50.445 --> 30:51.629
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

30:51.713 --> 30:52.946
<i>you and Agent Lee,</i>
<i>be ready to move out.</i>

30:52.998 --> 30:54.165
Yes, sir.

30:54.249 --> 30:55.583
Flamethrowers aren't
going to be enough.

30:55.634 --> 30:56.884
We're gonna need
some help.

31:03.652 --> 31:05.285
I've got recon team
throughout the city,

31:05.348 --> 31:06.714
spread out over
an eight-mile radius.

31:06.766 --> 31:08.550
So far we've determined
the fungus has encroached on

31:08.601 --> 31:10.051
at least a dozen
populated buildings,

31:10.103 --> 31:11.386
all of which
have been evacuated.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.720
But no other bodies
have been found.

31:12.772 --> 31:14.239
Thankfully, no.

31:14.323 --> 31:15.574
It's been well
over an hour.

31:15.658 --> 31:16.908
How's Dr. Bishop doing
with the boy?

31:16.993 --> 31:18.527
We haven't gotten
any word yet.

31:18.578 --> 31:19.861
Agent Broyles, if you
don't mind my asking,

31:19.912 --> 31:22.280
what exactly is our plan
to kill Gus?

31:22.365 --> 31:25.584
That's what Walter's
calling the organism.

31:25.668 --> 31:27.085
That's our plan,
Agent Lee,

31:27.170 --> 31:29.871
compliments of Nina Sharp
and Massive Dynamic.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.339
You two, along with one
of their techs,

31:31.407 --> 31:33.708
<i>will be administering</i>
<i>a potent toxin to the fungus.</i>

31:33.760 --> 31:36.428
Agent Broyles,
recon six is on the line.

31:36.512 --> 31:39.264
I'm gonna check in
with Walter.

31:40.249 --> 31:41.850
Walter.

31:41.917 --> 31:43.585
It's Olivia.

31:49.809 --> 31:53.195
Olivia, we've managed
to isolate Gus' brain wave.

31:53.262 --> 31:55.947
The link appears
to be centered somewhere

31:56.032 --> 31:58.433
inside of Aaron's
pre-frontal lobe.

31:58.484 --> 31:59.985
Okay, so you know
how to disconnect it.

32:00.069 --> 32:01.319
<i>Oh, no.</i>

32:01.404 --> 32:02.821
<i>No, I haven't quite</i>
<i>worked that out yet.</i>

32:02.905 --> 32:04.656
Okay, Walter, we're
running out of time.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.107
<i>I realize that.</i>

32:06.159 --> 32:08.276
<i>My attempts to shut down</i>
<i>that part of his brain</i>

32:08.327 --> 32:09.444
<i>haven't worked!</i>

32:09.495 --> 32:12.547
There's only one
other possible option.

32:12.615 --> 32:16.301
Surgically remove
the infected part.

32:16.385 --> 32:17.785
<i>What are you saying?</i>

32:17.837 --> 32:19.504
You're thinking
of lobotomizing him?

32:19.589 --> 32:21.223
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what else to do</i>

32:21.290 --> 32:22.724
in the time
I have left, Olivia.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.125
<i>Walter, you can't!</i>

32:24.177 --> 32:25.960
I have to save
his life.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.462
Whatever it takes.

32:27.513 --> 32:28.980
Okay, Walter,
listen to me.

32:29.065 --> 32:30.932
Now, you're gonna
find another way,

32:30.983 --> 32:31.983
and I'm gonna talk
to Broyles,

32:32.068 --> 32:33.068
explain
the situation to him,

32:33.135 --> 32:34.402
and see if
I can buy us some time.

32:34.470 --> 32:36.271
Stand by.
Sir.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.156
I just got word
from one of our teams.

32:38.241 --> 32:41.743
The fungus has reached
a subway platform in Midtown.

32:41.810 --> 32:43.612
We can't contain this thing.
We have to move on it now.

32:43.663 --> 32:45.831
You gave Walter two hours.
There's still time--

32:45.915 --> 32:47.616
I'm sorry, but you know
as well as I do

32:47.667 --> 32:49.668
we can't sacrifice
countless other lives

32:49.752 --> 32:51.786
to save one boy.

33:08.938 --> 33:10.171
Walter...

33:18.814 --> 33:20.014
What?

33:20.066 --> 33:22.350
No time to talk.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.852
I have to think.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.797
So what are we
looking for?

33:35.864 --> 33:38.633
<i>Somewhere the toxin will be</i>
<i>best distributed.</i>

33:38.701 --> 33:41.253
<i>Some sort of</i>
<i>central mass.</i>

33:41.337 --> 33:43.004
There.

33:49.929 --> 33:51.096
Agent Broyles,

33:51.180 --> 33:52.814
we've located
the injection point.

33:52.881 --> 33:55.317
<i>The tech is preparing</i>
<i>the toxin.</i>

33:55.384 --> 33:57.218
<i>That. Keep me apprised.</i>

34:09.699 --> 34:12.167
I was told
it was on your order.

34:14.003 --> 34:15.837
Olivia...

34:18.206 --> 34:19.424
Okay.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.246
No!

34:31.304 --> 34:33.188
Walter,

34:33.255 --> 34:34.922
his blood pressure
is falling,

34:34.974 --> 34:36.558
and he has lost
consciousness.

34:36.609 --> 34:39.226
Do something!

34:39.277 --> 34:41.563
I've run through every
conceivable scenario

34:41.614 --> 34:42.764
I can think of.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.766
That creature has
a hold on his brain,

34:44.817 --> 34:46.434
and I have no ide--

34:48.103 --> 34:50.705
wait. Wait!

34:50.773 --> 34:52.206
<i>What's happening in there?</i>

34:52.274 --> 34:54.275
The toxin's been administered,
but the technician is dead.

34:54.327 --> 34:55.943
<i>I want you and Agent Lee</i>

34:55.995 --> 34:57.278
<i>to fall back</i>
<i>to position one now!</i>

34:57.330 --> 34:58.496
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

34:58.581 --> 34:59.748
<i>Olivia.</i>

34:59.799 --> 35:01.616
Lincoln, what?
I can't move.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.718
What?

35:03.786 --> 35:06.221
<i>The source of Aaron's</i>
<i>physical distress</i>

35:06.288 --> 35:07.639
isn't isolated
in the pre-frontal lobe,

35:07.723 --> 35:08.807
as I thought.

35:08.891 --> 35:10.342
- It's also here.
- What is that?

35:10.426 --> 35:12.143
It's the limbic system.
Limbic!

35:12.228 --> 35:14.562
The emotional center
of the brain.

35:16.599 --> 35:18.233
Emotion...

35:18.300 --> 35:19.901
Yes.

35:19.968 --> 35:21.770
Astrid, get me
the epinephrine.

35:21.821 --> 35:23.605
The fungus has a hold
on Agent Lee.

35:23.656 --> 35:24.990
He requires
immediate medical help.

35:25.074 --> 35:26.324
<i>We're assembling a team now.</i>

35:26.409 --> 35:27.776
<i>Does the fungicide</i>
<i>appear to be working?</i>

35:30.329 --> 35:31.613
Negative.

35:31.664 --> 35:33.148
The organism's
still alive.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.200
I don't know why,
but it's not working.

35:35.284 --> 35:37.252
The link is emotional.

35:37.319 --> 35:38.486
<i>Gus doesn't have</i>
<i>a hold on him.</i>

35:38.537 --> 35:41.339
He has a hold on it.

35:45.845 --> 35:47.295
I'm sorry, son.

35:50.332 --> 35:53.301
Aaron! Aaron!
Listen to me!

35:53.352 --> 35:55.937
Aaron! Aaron!
Good boy, good boy.

35:56.004 --> 35:57.439
I know you're scared,

35:57.506 --> 36:00.275
but you need to let go
of the organism.

36:00.342 --> 36:03.678
No...It's my friend.
No.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.146
I'll be alone.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.315
I know you've come to believe
that it's your friend,

36:07.366 --> 36:08.650
but it's not real.

36:08.701 --> 36:12.353
It's something that's
invaded your mind.

36:12.405 --> 36:13.521
It's hurting you.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.823
Nobody cares.

36:14.874 --> 36:16.524
It doesn't matter.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.909
Walter, his blood pressure
is still falling.

36:17.993 --> 36:19.377
His organs
are shutting down.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.884
You matter to me.

36:25.968 --> 36:29.888
I care, and I...

36:29.972 --> 36:32.206
And I don't want
to lose you.

36:33.709 --> 36:35.477
I can't lose you.

36:35.544 --> 36:37.412
Not again.

36:42.651 --> 36:44.686
Aaron...

36:44.737 --> 36:48.656
I know how hard it is
to make connections.

36:48.724 --> 36:51.392
I know what it is
to be lonely.

36:51.444 --> 36:53.027
It takes courage
to be the one

36:53.079 --> 36:54.529
to take
someone else's hand,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.564
to trust that
they won't leave you.

36:56.615 --> 37:00.535
I won't leave you,
Aaron.

37:00.586 --> 37:04.205
And I'm begging you
not to leave me.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.073
Please.

37:07.543 --> 37:11.463
Let it go.
Let it go.

37:11.547 --> 37:14.215
Please.
Let it go, son.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.717
<i>Walter...</i>

37:15.768 --> 37:17.552
<i>I think it's working.</i>

37:17.603 --> 37:19.587
He's stabilizing.

37:30.950 --> 37:32.317
This is Dunham.

37:32.401 --> 37:35.269
Uh, something's happening.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.656
<i>Their brain waves</i>

37:38.741 --> 37:40.492
<i>have separated.</i>

37:40.576 --> 37:44.162
Uh...It's gone.

37:44.246 --> 37:46.548
<i>Gus is gone.</i>

37:52.638 --> 37:54.088
It's working!

37:54.140 --> 37:56.341
The organism's dying.

37:56.425 --> 37:57.675
Okay...

37:57.760 --> 38:00.728
We need a medical team
down here now!

38:03.349 --> 38:05.233
Lincoln,
can you hear me?

38:05.300 --> 38:07.018
It's okay.
It's okay.

38:07.102 --> 38:09.404
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

38:09.471 --> 38:11.406
Hey.

38:11.473 --> 38:14.108
Hey.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.644
You look
a little freaked out.

38:17.830 --> 38:19.914
You wanna talk
about it?

38:33.461 --> 38:35.295
Here.
You take him.

38:35.346 --> 38:37.797
No, he's yours.

38:37.848 --> 38:40.133
He'd be better off
with you.

38:40.184 --> 38:41.885
Toys are meant
to be played with.

38:43.270 --> 38:46.773
Yeah, I've seen the movie
with the talking toys.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.325
Oddly disturbing.

38:53.564 --> 38:55.014
Okay, Aaron,

38:55.066 --> 38:56.566
we gotta get you
to the hospital,

38:56.651 --> 38:58.068
or they're gonna
give your room away

38:58.152 --> 39:00.853
to somebody
who's really sick.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.622
Aren't you coming too?

39:02.690 --> 39:06.126
Well, I very much
wish I could...

39:11.582 --> 39:14.250
but I have things
I need to do.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.304
We'll see each other
again soon, I promise.

39:57.712 --> 39:59.963
Walter?

40:00.047 --> 40:03.049
Astrid told me the good news
about Aaron.

40:04.719 --> 40:07.053
I knew you'd figure...

40:10.057 --> 40:12.358
Walter?

40:13.761 --> 40:15.595
Walter?

40:20.317 --> 40:21.601
It's all right.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.269
The area
is completely numb.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.538
I--I know exactly
what I'm doing.

40:25.606 --> 40:26.873
Just let me do this.

40:26.940 --> 40:30.410
Just gonna put
the hammer down.

40:54.435 --> 40:55.902
Walter...

40:55.969 --> 40:58.855
What the hell
were you thinking?

40:58.939 --> 41:02.192
I don't want
to be recommitted.

41:02.276 --> 41:05.028
I can't go back there.

41:05.112 --> 41:06.780
Please don't
send me back.

41:06.831 --> 41:08.748
What are you
talking about?

41:08.816 --> 41:10.817
I'm going insane.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.871
I've been having
hallucinations.

41:14.955 --> 41:17.557
No matter what I do,
they won't stop.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.126
- What kind of hallucinations, Walter?
- For weeks now.

41:20.177 --> 41:22.428
I was afraid
to tell anyone.

41:22.496 --> 41:25.014
What are you seeing?

41:25.099 --> 41:27.300
It doesn't matter.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.018
Just tell me.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.391
A person.

41:36.527 --> 41:37.977
A young man.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.146
His voice is in my head,

41:40.197 --> 41:43.032
saying peculiar things.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.529
Does he look like this?

41:58.866 --> 42:00.500
Where did you get this?

42:00.551 --> 42:02.335
I drew it from memory.

42:02.386 --> 42:03.970
I've been seeing him
in my dreams

42:04.037 --> 42:05.972
for the past three weeks.

42:06.039 --> 42:09.475
And all this time...

42:09.543 --> 42:11.978
I thought
I was losing my mind,

42:12.045 --> 42:15.932
that he was a figment
of my psychosis.

42:16.016 --> 42:19.185
I'm perfectly sane!

42:19.236 --> 42:20.887
Here.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.024
Who is he?

42:25.075 --> 42:27.193
I don't know.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.112
I've been running
facial recognition

42:29.196 --> 42:31.948
through interagency databases,
including Interpol,

42:32.032 --> 42:33.499
but nothing's shown up.

42:35.502 --> 42:37.503
A shared vision
like this...

42:38.539 --> 42:40.456
He must be real!

42:40.541 --> 42:42.842
And if he's real...

42:43.844 --> 42:46.095
We have to find him.
