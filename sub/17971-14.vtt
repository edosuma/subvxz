(chuckles)

00:33.233 --> 00:35.968
Lester, I like your
stupid Kid Rock hat.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.169
My boy Ernie
bought it for me.

00:37.171 --> 00:40.072
He's been pulling double
shifts at the slaughterhouse.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.040
Ernie has a job?!

00:41.042 --> 00:44.910
Man, I sure wish Cleveland Jr.
showed initiative like that.

00:44.912 --> 00:48.414
He just sits around
the house like a fat.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.415
Like a fat what?

00:49.417 --> 00:50.716
I don't know, just a fat.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.151
Hey, if I wanted
to talk about kids,

00:52.153 --> 00:53.685
I would've become
a pediatrician.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.487
Or a pedophile like
my uncle Wendell.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.524
He was a bad man-- no point
in talking about it now.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.026
He also molested Jerry
O'Connell, so, you know,

01:01.028 --> 01:03.195
little bit of a
connection there.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.998
That'll be 12.50.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.834
(all laughing)

01:08.836 --> 01:10.202
I'll put it on your "tab."

01:10.204 --> 01:14.673
Great, we'll "pay you"
at the end of "the month."

01:14.675 --> 01:17.810
Good, I need it
to pay "my rent."

01:17.812 --> 01:19.545
(laughing)

01:19.547 --> 01:23.082
Oh, Gus, what a crazy
bar owner you are.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.083
To the Stool!

01:24.085 --> 01:25.317
ALL:
The Stool!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.852
Green Day!

01:28.855 --> 01:30.055
Hey, hey, hey!

01:30.057 --> 01:32.524
Hey, Dad, Ernie
just got a new bike.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.492
Can I get one, too?

01:33.494 --> 01:34.860
It's the electric kind,

01:34.862 --> 01:36.495
so it does all the
pedaling for you.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.931
I-It's like the
player piano of bikes.

01:38.933 --> 01:43.869
(sings a bright,
bouncy tune)

01:43.871 --> 01:46.705
<i>Hmm, is he stupid or smart?</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:48.807
<i>I can't figure it out.</i>

01:48.809 --> 01:50.576
Maybe if you got
a job like Ernie,

01:50.578 --> 01:52.978
you could buy that
bike for yourself.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.013
I work for
everything I have.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.517
Look around-- I bought
everything in here.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.518
Excuse me?!

01:59.520 --> 02:00.853
You most certainly did not.

02:00.855 --> 02:03.155
How about the cutlery?
Nope.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.389
I use it.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.257
Oh, I definitely bought

02:05.259 --> 02:06.758
that wrought iron
Golden Gate Bridge

02:06.760 --> 02:08.494
that's hanging in the hallway.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.496
Cleveland, my uncle made that.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.563
Uncle Leonard did?

02:11.565 --> 02:12.931
Damn, he ain't bad.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.767
He couldn't do
an Eiffel Tower, could he?

02:15.769 --> 02:16.468
Probably.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.337
Let's call him!

02:18.339 --> 02:22.574
Leonard, hey, it's
Cleveland Brown.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.643
Hey, it has been
a long time.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.578
Listen, you still making
wrought iron representations

02:26.580 --> 02:29.615
of world-famous
landmarks?

02:29.617 --> 02:30.182
Yeah?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.184
You think you could make a
wrought iron Eiffel Tower

02:32.186 --> 02:34.119
like the one they
got in Paris, France?

02:34.121 --> 02:36.321
How tall we
want the tower?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.857
I <i>don't</i> want it.
(Cleveland grumbling)

02:38.859 --> 02:40.492
No, we-we-we're getting it.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.294
All right, yeah,
uh, maybe not too tall,

02:42.296 --> 02:45.197
'cause we don't want it to
break up the flow of the room.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.799
But I guess we don't
want it too short, either,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.102
'cause it is
the Eiffel Tower, after all.

02:50.104 --> 02:53.172
How much is this
gonna cost, anyway?

02:53.174 --> 02:54.139
$700?!

02:54.141 --> 02:59.545
Hmm, I'm gonna pray on this
and I'm gonna call you back.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.946
$700.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.247
The point is,
Cleveland Jr.,

03:02.249 --> 03:05.851
you need a job and I'm
gonna help you find one.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.920
I'll do anything
but government work.

03:07.922 --> 03:11.223
Well, you're too skinny
for that, anyway.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.358
(both laughing)

03:13.360 --> 03:17.462
CLEVELAND:
<i>If Lester's boy can get</i>
<i>a job here, so can you.</i>

03:17.464 --> 03:21.266
It would be so cool
to work with Ernie.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.702
(cows mooing)

03:23.704 --> 03:25.637
Cow got out!

03:25.639 --> 03:28.140
No, fellas,
that's not a cow!

03:28.142 --> 03:29.808
Ah, no! Help!

03:29.810 --> 03:30.976
Moo! Moo!

03:30.978 --> 03:33.011
Stop mooing,
you fool!

03:33.013 --> 03:34.980
I moo when
I get scared.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.315
Moo! Moo!

03:36.317 --> 03:38.517
(clamoring)

03:40.620 --> 03:42.354
So you want
to be a paperboy.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.123
No better job
for a boy your age.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.125
When I was your age,
guess what I was.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.361
A paperboy?
Smart kid.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.963
Chief, I just read online

03:50.965 --> 03:53.865
the newspaper business
is officially dead.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.000
There's your headline.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.202
Well, I guess I'm
out of a job.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.670
Are you hiring?

03:58.672 --> 03:59.738
Hiring for what?

03:59.740 --> 04:00.872
Oh, come on!
If you're not hiring,

04:00.874 --> 04:04.176
then why am I even here,
when I could be at Kinko's

04:04.178 --> 04:07.646
updating my résumé?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.815
Moo.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.919
Oh, I need a drink.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.754
Getting you a job has
been more annoying

04:15.756 --> 04:19.858
than going to the bathroom
in a Chinese restaurant.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.100
(tiger growling,
Cleveland screaming)

04:30.803 --> 04:33.805
Heads up, buddy-- there's
no paper towels in there.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.275
Thank you.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.677
( sighs )

04:41.948 --> 04:45.050
Things out of place!
Things out of place!

04:48.755 --> 04:51.123
(honky-tonk piano plays)

05:01.267 --> 05:02.134
Here you go, sir.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.337
These were cluttering
the tables and my mind.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.438
Thank you, young man.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.208
How's about as a reward,
we do some coloring?

05:10.210 --> 05:12.444
Can you believe that
something so fun

05:12.446 --> 05:14.846
can be made of
paraffin wax?

05:14.848 --> 05:17.215
Aren't crayons
remarkable?

05:17.217 --> 05:19.017
Whiskey on the rocks.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.087
That'll be three
dollars American.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.022
You should pour
smaller drinks,

05:24.024 --> 05:26.925
so you can get more
out of every bottle

05:26.927 --> 05:28.026
and make more money.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.396
So you're saying by putting
less alcohol in each drink,

05:31.398 --> 05:33.198
I could make
more money?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.701
Does every bar
know about this?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.102
I don't know.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.872
Huh, this crayon says "peach,"

05:40.874 --> 05:43.642
but it doesn't taste
like a peach.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.744
You're right.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.080
It should say "wax."

05:48.082 --> 05:49.581
All right,
let's go home.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.185
Your son's a sharp little
fella, Cleveland.
Really?

05:53.187 --> 05:56.455
<i>Hmm, Gus thinks he's smart,</i>

05:56.457 --> 05:58.857
<i>but is Gus smart?</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:00.392
He just saved me
a lot of money.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.493
Junior, how
would you like

06:01.495 --> 06:03.995
to come work for me
here at the Stool?

06:03.997 --> 06:04.896
Well, all right!

06:04.898 --> 06:08.400
Look at you, a working
man, thanks to me.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.669
Now, Junior,
if you take this job,

06:10.671 --> 06:13.972
you might see your father
do some strange things,

06:13.974 --> 06:16.041
like swear a lot
or vomit on stuff

06:16.043 --> 06:19.411
or dance with some ladies
that aren't your stepmom

06:19.413 --> 06:20.946
and maybe aren't even ladies.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.182
Might dress up like a lady
himself to win the confidence

06:24.184 --> 06:25.817
of an out-of-town
businessman,

06:25.819 --> 06:28.153
and then swindle him
out of his inheritance.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.822
All of this needs
to stay a secret.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.191
Is that something
you can handle?

06:33.193 --> 06:34.159
I suppose so.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.194
Great, he can start tomorrow.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.829
Drinks are on the house,
everyone.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.866
I've just inherited
a large sum of money.

06:40.868 --> 06:44.136
Go wait in the car,
Junior.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.309
What's your problem, sourpuss?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.412
You haven't sent a text
all breakfast.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.714
Lacey Stapleton was
at the mall yesterday.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.084
That bougie private school ho
from around the way?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.253
Mm-hmm, she got a new puppy.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.221
Ooh, I hate her!

07:03.223 --> 07:04.456
Who's Lacey?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.190
Put it this way:

07:05.192 --> 07:07.893
We're the Paris and
Nicole of Stoolbend.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.295
Who?
You know, like Kim and Sheree?

07:10.297 --> 07:13.498
Come again?
Kristin and Heidi-- hello?!

07:13.500 --> 07:15.934
Oh, from Aesop's fables.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.568
No, you idiot!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.670
They're on <i>The Hills.</i>

07:18.672 --> 07:20.071
The foothills
of Appalachia?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.274
It's a show on MTV!

07:22.276 --> 07:24.309
The channel with the
Phil Collins videos?

07:24.311 --> 07:26.978
Ooh, your country ass
don't know anything!

07:26.980 --> 07:28.046
(heavy sigh)

07:28.048 --> 07:31.917
I need to get out
of this podunk cow town.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.851
Cow town?!

07:32.853 --> 07:34.352
We got a Best Buy.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.055
They don't put those
just anywhere.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.023
Cow town.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.459
Like a cow walks
into a store and says,

07:40.461 --> 07:43.795
"Moo, I need a stereo."

07:44.330 --> 07:47.165
Mom, I'm never gonna
amount to anything

07:47.167 --> 07:48.867
unless I get a puppy, too.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.237
Now, Roberta, you don't
need to copy what Lacey does.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.238
That's childish.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.540
What you need to do is
one-up her sorry ass,

07:55.542 --> 07:57.976
put that bitch to shame!

07:57.978 --> 07:59.077
Go on...

07:59.079 --> 08:00.145
When I was in high school,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.613
there was this girl
Courtney Bebb.

08:01.615 --> 08:05.250
She got a nice pair of shoes,
I got a nicer pair of shoes.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.286
She got a fancy coat,
so I got a fancier coat.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.423
She got a fancy car,
so you know what I did?

08:11.425 --> 08:12.424
You got a fancier car?

08:12.426 --> 08:15.160
No, couldn't afford that,
so I spread a rumor that

08:15.162 --> 08:17.395
she had an abortion and
her parents sent her

08:17.397 --> 08:18.497
to live with her aunt.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.499
Take that, take that,
take that, take that!

08:20.501 --> 08:23.869
There's one thing you need
to know about Tubbs women.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.538
We take all kinds
of (bleep) from men

08:26.540 --> 08:28.907
but never from
another woman.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.976
Hey, one of you hoes
go down to 7-11

08:30.978 --> 08:33.311
and get me
a Diet Dr. Pepper.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.313
Right away, sir.

08:37.216 --> 08:42.254
Boy, getting wasted with my
buds while my son cleans up.

08:42.256 --> 08:45.524
You know, that quirky
Holocaust movie was right--

08:45.526 --> 08:47.692
life <i>iss</i> beautiful.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.561
Daddy, this is
gonna sound crazy

08:49.563 --> 08:52.531
but Gus wasn't even keeping
track of your tab.

08:52.533 --> 08:57.002
And without a tab, there's no
way to know how much you owe.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.138
But now there is,
thanks to your boy.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.607
Which is thanks
to you, Cleveland.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.609
Yeah, "Thanks, Cleveland."

09:04.611 --> 09:06.144
He said sarcastically.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.646
What are you
gonna do about it?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.515
The only thing I can do--

09:10.517 --> 09:14.319
I'm going back to the island.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.501
(Tim grunting)

09:29.503 --> 09:34.439
Sorry, Mr. Bear, but that's
our only pair of house pants.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.574
And with our
new dress code,

09:35.576 --> 09:38.009
all customers are
required to wear pants.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.378
We're trying to draw
a more upscale crowd.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.047
Well, they're, they're
a little tight.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.583
When I go home, it's gonna
take me a few minutes

09:44.585 --> 09:46.618
just to peel
my slab off my bag.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.354
How come the football
game isn't on?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.555
This <i>is</i> football.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.556
In Europe.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.457
We'll get
more customers

09:52.459 --> 09:55.327
if we appeal to an
international clientele.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.228
Still zero-zero!

09:57.230 --> 09:59.931
(cheering, applause)

10:02.101 --> 10:03.234
Uh, son?
One sec, Dad.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.271
Rebecca, I need you to break
down that four top into two twos

10:06.273 --> 10:07.372
and to marry the ketchups.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.708
Alberto, where's my
heirloom tomato salad?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.609
<i>Necesito pronto.</i>

10:10.611 --> 10:12.143
<i>¿Mira, qué estás haciendo?</i>

10:12.145 --> 10:13.345
Yeah, Dad?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.679
Son, I need to
talk to you.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.181
I need to talk
to you, too.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.183
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.518
We need to free up
that table for
paying customers.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.722
What?!
I'm not going anywhere!

10:23.724 --> 10:26.691
Then our bouncer
will show you out.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.892
Dick Clark!

10:27.894 --> 10:30.962
(weak, raspy):
Happy New Year!

10:38.070 --> 10:40.538
(giggling):
Look, she's Lady Gaga...

10:40.540 --> 10:42.707
with less fleas.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.010
Nice backpack, lesbo.

10:45.012 --> 10:45.310
Yeah?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.113
Well, meet what's inside
the backpack, trick.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.349
My adopted Malawian son
Dikembe,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.418
from the village of Mutombo.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.653
(crowd gasping)

10:54.655 --> 10:56.154
Let me at the white women.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.690
Wow, you adopted
an African baby.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.524
That's right.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.761
Just like that old
British transvestite.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.461
Madonna?

11:03.463 --> 11:04.863
Yup, that's his name.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.699
Big deal.
This kid probably has AIDS.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.667
(all gasp)

11:08.669 --> 11:10.402
I don't.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.037
(all cheer)

11:14.106 --> 11:16.174
This place is dead.
No tunes.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.343
And the chicks are all
the wrong kind of Asians.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.212
Yeah, and I think
that the man over there is

11:21.214 --> 11:24.215
really into the microfiche.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.117
(shuddering gasps)

11:27.586 --> 11:28.653
(resumes shuddering gasps)

11:28.655 --> 11:31.956
Hmm. We need to get
the Stool back

11:31.958 --> 11:32.991
to the way it was.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.693
I'm sorry, could
you guys keep it down?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.428
I'm trying to "reek."

11:36.430 --> 11:39.597
(whispering):
Well, the Stool's never gonna
be the same as long as...

11:39.599 --> 11:41.132
(loudly):
...Cleveland Junior...

11:41.134 --> 11:43.435
(whispering):
...is working there.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.602
You're right.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.637
I got us into this.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.305
You'll get us out.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.173
(laughs)

11:48.175 --> 11:50.508
Just kidding.
My show. I'll do it.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.379
(camera shutters clicking)

11:54.381 --> 11:56.347
Hi, Roberta, I'm Lacey's mother.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.551
And you must be the African boy.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.186
Hello, African boy.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.823
I chair an organization
called Caucasian Heroes

12:04.825 --> 12:06.825
Offering Dollars
Everywhere.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.560
CHODE?
Ooh! Smart one.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.829
I'd like you both
to be honored guests

12:10.831 --> 12:13.531
at my fund-raiser tomorrow
night, and tell your story.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.602
In front of people?
Yeah. Lots of people.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.104
See you tomorrow.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.773
Could you pull my car
around, please?

12:21.775 --> 12:22.841
I'm not a valet.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.376
That's not what I asked.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.615
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Junior.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.784
You may want
to sit down.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.687
You know, I don't think
sitting was quite right.

12:35.689 --> 12:39.557
How about if you crouch
like a baseball catcher?

12:39.559 --> 12:42.627
Uh, I was thinking
a little less Gary Carter

12:42.629 --> 12:45.463
and a little
more Tony Peña.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.665
Wrong leg, but close enough.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.668
Now, I received
an anonymous call.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.637
The man threatened
to tell the police

12:52.639 --> 12:55.406
that I have a 14-year-old
working at my bar

12:55.408 --> 12:56.808
if I didn't fire you.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.475
Really?
Yup.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.812
And then he asked me if
I thought that $700 was too much

13:00.814 --> 13:02.881
to pay for a wrought iron
Eiffel Tower.

13:02.883 --> 13:06.284
Then I said, "Your voice
sounds familiar. Who is this?"

13:06.286 --> 13:09.120
He said, "This is
Cleveland Brown, oops."

13:09.122 --> 13:10.622
And I said,
"Well, Mr. Oops,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.291
"I don't know why this is
any of your business,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.360
"but I don't want any
trouble around here,

13:15.362 --> 13:16.528
so I'll let him go."

13:16.530 --> 13:18.263
I'm sorry,
Cleveland Jr.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.831
I understand.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.100
You're not going
to cry, are you?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.268
No, I'm not.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.805
For the first time in my life,
I'm not going to cry.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.706
What <i>are</i> you gonna do?

13:39.718 --> 13:42.587
I'm gonna get even
with that candy-ass,

13:42.589 --> 13:45.256
son-of-a-(bleep) bitch!

13:51.297 --> 13:53.264
(clacking)

13:58.504 --> 14:00.271
Hey, baby.
How was the Stool?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.807
(slurring):
It... was... awesome.

14:02.809 --> 14:06.110
It's back to the way
it used to be.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.112
All gross and free.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.149
And no more of that
bogus bogusness

14:11.151 --> 14:13.785
that this one did
to the place.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.654
Hey, Junior, why weren't
you there tonight?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.923
You're not working
there anymore?

14:18.925 --> 14:21.226
No. I was fired.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.594
Oh, you know why?

14:22.596 --> 14:27.298
'Cause you were awful
and it was a bad job you did.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.701
You suck.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.736
I'm proud of you, son.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.938
You did a good job.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.542
You did a bad job.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.845
(snoring)

14:40.847 --> 14:43.848
(thunder cracking)

14:48.320 --> 14:50.421
(snoring continues)

14:50.423 --> 14:52.957
(birds chirping)

14:52.959 --> 14:53.925
(panting)

14:53.927 --> 14:56.294
Water, water, water, water.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.429
(panting, gulping)

14:58.431 --> 15:00.732
Water, water.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.835
No more water.

15:03.837 --> 15:06.671
(sighs)

15:10.242 --> 15:13.411

16:28.621 --> 16:29.887
What happened to your mustache?!

16:29.889 --> 16:32.390
(high-pitched):
I don't know! It's just gone.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.624
It's gone!

16:33.626 --> 16:35.360
And what's wrong
with your voice?

16:35.362 --> 16:38.730
My mustache must have
provided a natural filter!

16:38.732 --> 16:41.432
You've got too much face
without your mustache!

16:41.434 --> 16:42.333
I know!

16:42.335 --> 16:43.568
That's why I wear it!

16:43.570 --> 16:47.405
You sound and look like a
man I don't want to be with!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.340
Oh, rats!

16:50.542 --> 16:52.477
Sudden weight gain,
balance problems,

16:52.479 --> 16:55.046
and your body has
rejected the mustache.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.048
I'm afraid
you have DMA.

16:57.050 --> 16:57.815
DMA?!

16:57.817 --> 17:01.085
Depilatory Mustachial Alopecia.
Heavens!

17:01.087 --> 17:03.021
Listen, lots of
DMA-positive men

17:03.023 --> 17:06.024
go on to live
very full lives.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.525
What's on your lip?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.460
Uh, eyeliner.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.661
Come on, Cleveland.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.764
You're better
than that.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.098
Stop it. Stop it.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.033
There you go.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.467
I'll write you
a prescription,

17:16.469 --> 17:17.902
but until then,
here's a prosthesis.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.571
You want the Fred Goldman
or the John Waters?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.840
Hmm, I guess the Fred Goldman.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.343
(normal pitch):
Oh, that's better.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.177
Nice, very natural.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.845
Now, you're going to
have to pay in cash.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.581
Our insurance
machine is broken.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.020
(indistinct chatter)

17:36.022 --> 17:38.823
All right, everyone, okay.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.591
CHODE is just tickled pink

17:40.593 --> 17:42.794
to have this inspiring
young lady with us.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.163
So, please, put your
wealthy hands together

17:45.165 --> 17:47.098
for Roberta Tubbs.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.900
(applause, cheering)

17:48.902 --> 17:50.034
(clears throat)

17:50.036 --> 17:52.036
Thank you all for coming.

17:52.038 --> 17:56.007
So... uh... what's up?

17:56.009 --> 17:56.774
Ms. Tubbs.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.076
What measures have you taken

17:58.078 --> 18:00.445
to preserve your son's
tribal identity?

18:00.447 --> 18:03.648
Uh, he... sleeps in the dirt?

18:03.650 --> 18:06.784
I've never heard of
the village of Mutombo.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.419
The village of Mawhozits?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.888
(all murmuring)

18:11.557 --> 18:13.091
Okay, look, the thing is...

18:13.093 --> 18:14.092
(clears throat)

18:14.094 --> 18:16.794
I... I... I...

18:16.796 --> 18:21.032
(Rallo faking
an African tribal song)

18:24.103 --> 18:27.505
(holding note)

18:32.144 --> 18:34.078
My name is Dikembe.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.914
I journey many mile to be here.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.917
With the help of
a farting warthog

18:39.919 --> 18:42.620
and a wisecracking meerkat,

18:42.622 --> 18:45.189
I escaped my war-torn village

18:45.191 --> 18:48.059
to a hotel in Rwanda.

18:48.061 --> 18:51.028
(crowd murmuring)

18:51.030 --> 18:52.730
So, I say unto you

18:52.732 --> 18:55.166
as my forefathers
said unto me,

18:55.168 --> 18:56.934
"Mama-se, mama-sa, ma-ma-coo-sa!

18:56.936 --> 19:00.471
Coming to America
out of Africa!" Good night!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.039
(cheering, applause)

19:02.041 --> 19:03.774
(dog whimpers)

19:08.680 --> 19:09.413
I can't believe

19:09.415 --> 19:11.916
I've got Depilatory
Mustachical Alopecia.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.686
Why don't you shut up or get
the hell out of my country?

19:15.688 --> 19:16.921
Hey, fellas.

19:16.923 --> 19:20.158
Brought you another round
from your secret stash.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.560
Those is some
loose-ass caps.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.261
I don't know, Gus.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.896
Normally after a few of these,

19:24.898 --> 19:26.831
I can tolerate
these sons of bitches.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.798
But for some reason,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.968
right now I just want
to punch them in the head.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.069
Do it then.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.204
Punch me in the...

19:33.206 --> 19:34.038
(grunts)
My head!

19:34.040 --> 19:36.207
Stay out of this,
Dinklage.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.742
(grunting)

19:37.744 --> 19:39.243
What the hell
was that for?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.678
This is what's happening.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.913
Deal with it.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.382
(all grunting, groaning)

19:45.751 --> 19:46.951
Bravo, gentlemen.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.787
Junior?
Wh-What are you doing here?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.222
Dad, I did
all of this--

19:51.224 --> 19:54.192
the mustache,
the T-shirts-- everything.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.794
I've been
teaching you a lesson.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.829
What?!
And guess what?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.298
You're all sober.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.933
(all gasp)
Wha...?
That's right.

20:01.935 --> 20:05.636
I replaced your beer
with that nonalcoholic crap

20:05.638 --> 20:07.939
George W. Bush
pretended to drink.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.273
But... but why?

20:09.275 --> 20:12.643
I wanted to get you back
for getting me fired.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.645
Wait, you did this
all by yourself?

20:14.647 --> 20:17.248
Well, I did have
a little help.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.282
Dr. Fist?!

20:18.284 --> 20:20.985
That's right, I was in on
the scheme the whole time.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.620
I was acting,
Cleveland.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.655
I studied drama
at Northwestern

20:24.657 --> 20:26.057
before I went
into medicine.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.226
How was the performance?
Was I believable?

20:28.228 --> 20:30.361
You were very good.
Very natural.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.697
But you <i>are</i> my doctor.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.998
Right. But I was <i>acting</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:35.800
like a <i>different</i> doctor.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.135
Of the same name.
Exactly.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.338
I'm proud of you, son.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.973
<i>Maybe he is smart.</i>

20:41.975 --> 20:45.243
<i>It was stupid of him</i>
<i>to tell me, though.</i>

20:45.245 --> 20:47.311
(sinister laugh)

20:47.313 --> 20:50.281
I'm glad you're all made up
and everything,

20:50.283 --> 20:52.683
but can someone get me
to a hospital?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.653
Well, as a doctor,
I prescribe a round of shots.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.322
Nobody's afraid of shots
around here, are they?

20:58.324 --> 21:00.658
(all laugh)

21:01.093 --> 21:03.928
(high-pitched):
Oh, gosh darn it!
