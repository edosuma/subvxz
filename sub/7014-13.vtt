WEBVTT

00:04.008 --> 00:06.676
So Fez thought he was
on a date with Suzy,

00:06.744 --> 00:09.245
and he shot a rabbit
to impress her.

00:09.313 --> 00:11.647
Doesn't he know he could
have just bought her flowers?

00:11.715 --> 00:14.717
Oh, I would die if
you got me flowers.

00:14.785 --> 00:17.053
You'd be lucky to
get a dead rabbit.

00:18.889 --> 00:21.357
Suzy, why would Fez think
you'd like a dead rabbit?

00:21.425 --> 00:24.660
Are you from the
south or something?

00:24.728 --> 00:27.130
No. I think he did
it because he knows

00:27.197 --> 00:29.699
that as a cop, I
like to spill blood.

00:29.767 --> 00:33.269
But I want to hurt
people, not animals.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.138
You know what? This is my fault.

00:35.205 --> 00:37.940
I never should have told Fez you
liked him when you liked me.

00:38.008 --> 00:39.142
If only there was something

00:39.209 --> 00:40.843
I could do to make
him feel better.

00:40.911 --> 00:42.245
I have an idea.

00:42.312 --> 00:45.081
Oh, good. Kelso's gonna
make it worse now.

00:45.149 --> 00:47.650
No, look. Just let Fez
take you to dinner,

00:47.718 --> 00:50.620
and then for dessert,
do it with him.

00:51.687 --> 00:53.588
No way.

00:53.656 --> 00:56.191
Okay, if you do me this
favor, I'll buy you a new gun.

00:56.259 --> 00:58.260
That would make her a hooker.

00:58.327 --> 01:02.631
No. Hookers do it for money.
This would be for a gun.

01:02.698 --> 01:04.433
Hey, I have standards.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.535
I mean, if it's
sleeping with a suspect

01:06.602 --> 01:08.837
to extract some information, fine,

01:08.905 --> 01:11.006
or posing as a
prostitute for a quickie

01:11.074 --> 01:14.810
in the back of a car to
snare some John, sure.

01:14.877 --> 01:18.346
But jeez, Michael, what kind
of girl do you think I am?

01:21.184 --> 01:22.451
Hello, Suzy.

01:22.518 --> 01:24.753
I'd love to stand
here and stare at you

01:24.821 --> 01:26.488
until you get uncomfortable...

01:28.556 --> 01:30.857
But I have a relationship to end.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.427
Kelso, here's everything
you ever gave me.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.297
I don't want it anymore.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.033
Look, Fez, you don't
have to do this.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.768
Yeah. Fez, when you
split up with someone,

01:41.836 --> 01:43.271
you don't have to give stuff back.

01:43.272 --> 01:44.739
You wait until they
leave the house,

01:44.740 --> 01:47.242
take everything they care
about and break the rest.

01:48.310 --> 01:52.179
That way, they have nothing.

01:52.247 --> 01:54.882
Lucky for me I
already have nothing.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.518
Oh, you can have less.

01:59.020 --> 02:02.289
The point is that I don't
want anything you gave me.

02:02.357 --> 02:05.225
I never gave you my yo-yo.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.394
So I took it,

02:07.462 --> 02:11.565
and I tangled the string, too.

02:11.633 --> 02:15.102
Let's see you walk the dog
now, you son of a bitch.

02:22.874 --> 02:25.910
Are those new birth-control pills?

02:29.548 --> 02:33.050
Let the doing it... commence.

02:33.118 --> 02:35.653
Do you have to do that every time?

02:35.721 --> 02:39.490
Donna, if I had the money, I'd
take out an ad in the paper.

02:41.793 --> 02:43.027
Oh, no.

02:43.095 --> 02:45.596
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:45.664 --> 02:47.565
Never say, "oh, no"

02:47.632 --> 02:49.834
when you're talking about
birth-control pills.

02:49.901 --> 02:51.670
Anything's better than "oh, no."

02:51.737 --> 02:53.772
I forgot to take one.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.640
Except that. Oh, God. Oh, God.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.410
Oh, my God. One minute my
life's all light and breezy,

02:58.477 --> 03:01.913
and the next, I'm shackled
to you and some kid.

03:03.981 --> 03:05.049
Oh, my God.

03:05.216 --> 03:07.251
Oh, my God, my heart
is pounding so hard...

03:07.319 --> 03:08.752
Like in the cartoons,

03:08.820 --> 03:10.020
when Daisy duck sees Donald duck,

03:10.088 --> 03:12.022
and her heart goes, "ba-bo!
Ba-boom!"

03:12.090 --> 03:14.325
But that was a happy
thing, and this is 'cause

03:14.392 --> 03:16.493
you couldn't keep your
dirty hands off me!

03:16.561 --> 03:17.961
Okay, come on, let's think.

03:17.962 --> 03:19.830
Hey, there's only a
couple times a month

03:19.831 --> 03:21.765
something like this
can happen, right?

03:21.833 --> 03:23.334
Maybe there's some kind
of time-related loophole.

03:23.401 --> 03:25.369
Hey, did we spring
forward or fall back?

03:26.437 --> 03:28.271
When we did it? I don't know.

03:28.339 --> 03:31.474
I don't know what you'd call it,
but it's the same every time.

03:33.043 --> 03:35.744
Well, I can't be that bad, Donna.
I got you pregnant!

04:06.909 --> 04:09.978
Hello, Wisconsin!

04:17.541 --> 04:21.677
Eric, I can't believe you
knocked up a girl, too.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.779
I mean, you lose
points for not doing it

04:23.847 --> 04:26.715
in a public place,
but hey, gimme five.

04:26.783 --> 04:28.083
Kelso, I don't really think

04:28.151 --> 04:30.152
this is a gimme five moment, okay?

04:30.220 --> 04:32.121
I am really freaked out.

04:32.189 --> 04:36.425
Well, right now I'm not so
much freaked out as starving.

04:38.261 --> 04:41.263
I'm fascinated by your nose.

04:41.331 --> 04:42.731
Yeah, it's perfect.

04:42.799 --> 04:46.268
You'd be amazed at what
I could fit up in there.

04:46.336 --> 04:48.037
But the important thing is

04:48.104 --> 04:49.738
that you have
responsibilities now,

04:49.806 --> 04:52.174
so you gotta step up like I did.

04:52.242 --> 04:55.244
Look, if you mean you
stepped up on a urinal

04:55.312 --> 04:57.012
to climb out of a window

04:57.080 --> 04:59.048
to get away from the
girl you got pregnant,

04:59.115 --> 05:01.784
then yeah, you stepped up.

05:01.852 --> 05:03.752
Still no Fez, huh?

05:03.820 --> 05:06.188
Wow, kelso, you really
must have pissed him off.

05:06.256 --> 05:07.590
He hasn't stayed away this long

05:07.591 --> 05:09.292
since he discovered bubble baths.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.694
Yeah. Fez still
isn't talking to me,

05:11.762 --> 05:14.564
but I think he's calling,
'cause every once in awhile,

05:14.632 --> 05:16.866
I pick up the phone, and
all I hear is breathing

05:16.934 --> 05:20.003
and the crinkle of a
candy being unwrapped.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.938
Man, we are sitting in the circle

05:22.006 --> 05:23.807
talking about relationships.

05:23.874 --> 05:25.909
What happened to us?

05:25.976 --> 05:29.612
This stash must be
from California.

05:35.219 --> 05:37.387
Oh, hey, Donna. Any news?

05:37.455 --> 05:40.123
Come on, that time of the month!

05:40.191 --> 05:43.326
No. Nothing yet. Oh, God.
I'm gonna throw up.

05:43.394 --> 05:46.663
I told you we should
have gone to Denny's.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.667
Oh, yeah, Donna, let's not talk

05:50.734 --> 05:53.103
about throwing up in
front of the customers.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.239
Ma'am, here's your creamed corn.

05:56.307 --> 05:58.274
I got no interest in
getting a lady pregnant.

05:58.342 --> 05:59.742
That's why I'm celibate.

05:59.810 --> 06:03.646
I thought it was because no
one would do it with you.

06:03.714 --> 06:06.649
Hey, that's, like,
a secondary reason.

06:06.717 --> 06:10.320
Look, Donna, we're gonna
figure this out, okay?

06:10.387 --> 06:12.522
Hey, you know what?
We can ask my mom.

06:12.590 --> 06:14.524
She's a nurse.
She loves this stuff.

06:14.592 --> 06:17.894
At least once a week, she
gives a talk about her uterus.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.730
Eric, I don't want
your mom to know.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.465
Donna's right. There's no reason

06:22.533 --> 06:24.634
to let too many
people know just yet.

06:24.702 --> 06:27.103
Who have you told so far?

06:27.171 --> 06:30.507
Well, just my friends
and this nice couple.

06:32.009 --> 06:35.345
Okay, look, so I'll just tell
you what my mom says, okay?

06:35.412 --> 06:37.347
Okay. Just make sure
she doesn't know

06:37.414 --> 06:38.848
you're talking about us.

06:38.916 --> 06:42.051
Tell her you have a
friend, a Canadian friend,

06:42.119 --> 06:44.621
who lives in an igloo,
so she can't call her.

06:45.856 --> 06:49.292
Donna, I think I know
how to be subtle.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.996
Mommy, mommy!
Donna might be pregnant!

06:55.499 --> 06:57.800
Did she trap you?
We'll move you away.

06:57.868 --> 06:59.702
We won't play her game.

06:59.770 --> 07:02.105
No. No, it's nothing like that.

07:02.173 --> 07:04.207
It's just...
I had to tell someone.

07:04.275 --> 07:06.943
Hey, promise me you won't
say anything to dad.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.345
Fine. I promise.
Oh, this is all my fault.

07:09.413 --> 07:11.648
I should never have been
intimate with your father

07:11.715 --> 07:14.150
while you were in the
crib next to the bed.

07:21.592 --> 07:22.926
Hey, Fez.

07:24.762 --> 07:27.030
Well, I don't think
he wants to make up.

07:27.097 --> 07:28.631
Well, try anyway.

07:28.699 --> 07:33.102
I got your back...
Your strong, muscular back.

07:34.838 --> 07:39.008
Uh, Fez, look, I
got you some candy

07:39.076 --> 07:42.645
and a "Playboy"

07:42.713 --> 07:44.447
and a six-pack.

07:44.515 --> 07:49.152
So you can use 'em in
whatever order you want.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.388
Tell him what they're for.

07:52.456 --> 07:54.390
In a tense standoff, you
need to make the perp

07:54.458 --> 07:56.259
think you're on his side,

07:56.327 --> 07:58.861
even if you're about to
put a bullet in his head.

07:58.929 --> 08:01.631
Don't worry. We're not.

08:01.699 --> 08:03.633
Uh...

08:03.701 --> 08:05.335
They're a peace offering.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.371
Well, look at the American

08:08.439 --> 08:11.975
trying to buy his
way out of trouble.

08:12.042 --> 08:14.510
Fez, give Michael a chance.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.512
You know what?
No, Simpson, forget it.

08:17.580 --> 08:21.083
Fez, you're the one that
blew it with Suzy, okay?

08:21.150 --> 08:23.919
I don't know you were going
to shoot a defenseless rabbit.

08:23.987 --> 08:28.857
Well, if you didn't know that,
then you never knew me at all!

08:28.925 --> 08:30.826
Whatever!

08:30.893 --> 08:32.895
You know what, I don't
care if you're mad at me,

08:32.895 --> 08:35.364
'cause now I'm mad at you!

08:35.432 --> 08:38.267
Fine! Well, you could
keep your stupid gifts,

08:38.335 --> 08:40.635
because now I don't want them!

08:49.646 --> 08:53.049
If you must know, it
will be this then this.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.793
So you knocked up
the neighbour girl.

09:03.861 --> 09:05.528
Oh, my God.

09:05.596 --> 09:08.097
You should've been thinking
a little more about God

09:08.165 --> 09:10.800
before you got into this mess.

09:10.868 --> 09:13.736
He would've stopped
you at first base.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.939
Mom, you promised you
wouldn't say anything.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.041
And I didn't. I wrote it down.

09:27.948 --> 09:29.916
So you're pregnant.

09:29.983 --> 09:33.386
Okay, well, um, okay.

09:33.453 --> 09:34.454
We'll move the wedding
to next month,

09:34.455 --> 09:36.056
and then nine months
later, we'll tell people

09:36.124 --> 09:39.426
the baby came early
because you smoked.

09:39.494 --> 09:42.162
No. I don't want to
move the wedding up.

09:42.230 --> 09:43.830
Don't we get a say in this?

09:43.898 --> 09:45.699
Red, say something.

09:45.767 --> 09:49.036
Oh.

09:49.103 --> 09:51.838
Donna, he's not gonna help us.

09:51.906 --> 09:53.840
Right now he's
trying to figure out

09:53.908 --> 09:56.210
how to get both of his
feet in both of our asses

09:56.277 --> 09:57.945
without leaving his chair.

09:58.846 --> 10:01.682
Stop being weird.

10:01.749 --> 10:04.351
We'll just have to
make the best of this.

10:04.419 --> 10:06.687
Besides, with Donna for a mother,

10:06.754 --> 10:11.358
there's a decent chance the
kid'll be good at sports.

10:11.426 --> 10:14.528
Well, Donna, I think you're
too young to be a mother,

10:14.596 --> 10:16.096
so here's what we do...

10:16.164 --> 10:18.232
Tell the kid you're his sister,

10:18.299 --> 10:20.734
midge and I are the parents,
and when he turns 18,

10:20.802 --> 10:23.237
tell him we lied.

10:23.304 --> 10:26.440
Probably get a good chuckle
out of the whole thing.

10:27.842 --> 10:29.943
Eric, a little help?

10:30.011 --> 10:32.713
Okay. You guys...

10:32.780 --> 10:35.349
Okay. Whether we're
pregnant or not,

10:35.416 --> 10:37.251
we can run our own lives, okay?

10:37.318 --> 10:38.518
Yeah.

10:38.586 --> 10:40.854
And you know what?
It would have been great

10:40.922 --> 10:43.724
if Donna could have had a
career, but things change.

10:44.391 --> 10:46.192
So, you know, fine,

10:46.260 --> 10:49.229
so you'll stay home with the baby.

10:49.296 --> 10:51.698
Whoa. What?

10:51.765 --> 10:53.566
So I don't get a career?

10:53.634 --> 10:56.002
Well, you know...

10:56.070 --> 10:58.605
You could sell
tupperware or something.

11:00.774 --> 11:02.742
Okay, you can just get bent.

11:02.810 --> 11:04.911
What? Oh, come on. What did I say?

11:04.979 --> 11:06.512
That wasn't so bad, was it?

11:06.580 --> 11:09.849
No. I would love a tupperware
lady in the family.

11:16.957 --> 11:19.993
Oh, hey, Jackie, have you
seen Donna? Is she okay?

11:20.060 --> 11:21.928
Well, she wanted me
to tell you a secret.

11:21.996 --> 11:24.831
Okay. Ow!

11:24.899 --> 11:27.934
Hey, guys. Ooh, what
stinks out here?

11:28.002 --> 11:31.971
It must be this big,
girl-stealing turd.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.240
All right. That's it.

11:34.308 --> 11:35.408
Let's go.

11:35.476 --> 11:37.143
Oh, I will slap you silly.

11:37.211 --> 11:38.778
Oh, stop!

11:38.846 --> 11:40.780
Hey, look, Jackie's
right, all right?

11:40.848 --> 11:42.782
If you guys want to
fight, let's go inside

11:42.850 --> 11:44.984
where there's more stuff
to hit your head on.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.021
Come on, you guys,
lots of couples fight,

11:48.088 --> 11:49.689
but there's an easy
way to fix this.

11:49.757 --> 11:51.591
Just decide which one
of you is the woman,

11:51.659 --> 11:55.461
and the other one just apologize.

11:55.529 --> 11:59.065
No. I don't want to
make up with kelso.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.334
I want to make fun of kelso.

12:01.402 --> 12:03.636
Hey, guys, what's up with kelso?

12:03.704 --> 12:05.271
Stupid.

12:07.341 --> 12:10.143
Hey, guys, what's up with Fez?

12:10.210 --> 12:11.711
Foreign.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.083
Okay, you guys, this I
s getting pretty lame.

12:17.151 --> 12:18.184
Let's split into two groups.

12:18.252 --> 12:20.019
Good idea... boys and girls.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.454
Let's go, Jackie.

12:21.522 --> 12:22.956
What?

12:27.161 --> 12:29.696
How you doing, kitten?

12:29.763 --> 12:31.564
Fine.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.068
I don't know.

12:35.135 --> 12:38.137
I'm scared.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.542
Just know that whether
you're pregnant or not,

12:42.609 --> 12:44.110
you're still my little girl.

12:44.178 --> 12:45.545
I support you.

12:45.612 --> 12:47.380
Thanks, dad.

12:47.448 --> 12:50.416
But if you are pregnant,
don't let red touch the baby.

12:52.286 --> 12:55.922
He thinks he's tickling,
but he just pokes.

12:57.358 --> 12:59.959
Trust me, I know from experience.

13:00.027 --> 13:02.729
Well, dad, maybe red wasn't
trying to tickle you.

13:02.796 --> 13:05.398
Maybe he was trying to poke you.

13:05.466 --> 13:07.233
Why would red poke me?

13:07.301 --> 13:09.202
Why would he tickle you?

13:12.472 --> 13:14.573
Fez, since you're mad at Michael,

13:14.640 --> 13:16.575
shouldn't you be
cutting his head out

13:16.642 --> 13:20.178
of those pictures
instead of your head?

13:20.246 --> 13:21.913
Oh, I can't do that.

13:21.981 --> 13:24.916
Have you seen how
well he photographs?

13:24.984 --> 13:28.086
Fez, I can't believe you're
gonna let it end this way.

13:28.154 --> 13:31.256
I always thought you and
Michael would make it.

13:31.324 --> 13:34.159
Well, we look good in public,

13:34.227 --> 13:37.629
but you weren't there
for the bad times...

13:37.697 --> 13:42.167
Like he never noticed
when I got a new outfit.

13:42.168 --> 13:44.737
Fez, just do what I did
to get over Michael.

13:44.804 --> 13:46.906
Make out with Hyde?

13:48.742 --> 13:50.776
No. Just stop thinking about him.

13:50.844 --> 13:54.046
I can't.

13:56.316 --> 13:59.285
Even the hub reminds me of him.

13:59.352 --> 14:01.320
I remember this one day.

14:01.388 --> 14:06.158
It was the only day the
hub ever had tater tots...

14:06.226 --> 14:09.028
And there was this
really big tater tot,

14:09.095 --> 14:11.363
and I'll never forget
what kelso said.

14:11.431 --> 14:14.333
He said...

14:14.401 --> 14:18.771
That's not a tater tot.
That's a tater giant."

14:22.042 --> 14:25.978
Oh, how we laughed.

14:26.046 --> 14:29.782
Oh, Fez, Michael took
me for granted, too.

14:29.849 --> 14:32.651
But I found someone
better, and so will you.

14:32.719 --> 14:36.655
Yeah, don't end it all now.
You have so much to live for.

14:36.723 --> 14:40.092
That's what we say when 're
trying to talk down a jumper.

14:41.895 --> 14:45.164
I guess it doesn't
really apply here.

14:47.601 --> 14:50.302
You know, I'm glad Fez
is out of my life.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.805
Always with the mood swings,

14:52.872 --> 14:55.808
and I'd ask what's wrong,
and all I'd hear was,

14:55.875 --> 14:57.643
"nothing."

14:57.711 --> 14:59.111
And then the minute I want

14:59.179 --> 15:02.214
to watch a game, suddenly it's
time to talk about our feelings.

15:02.282 --> 15:04.450
Women.

15:04.517 --> 15:06.385
Actually, we're
talking about a man.

15:06.453 --> 15:08.487
Boy, you guys are progressive.

15:08.555 --> 15:11.190
The thing is, I know I
didn't do anything wrong,

15:11.257 --> 15:14.326
but where am I gonna find
another friend like Fez?

15:14.394 --> 15:16.429
Look, man, there are plenty of
other fish in the sea, okay?

15:17.397 --> 15:18.599
It's like when you
and Jackie broke up.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.701
It was for the best,
and after awhile,

15:20.769 --> 15:22.969
she found someone better... me.

15:24.137 --> 15:26.939
And since then, I've enjoyed
throwing that in your face

15:27.007 --> 15:29.008
as often as possible.

15:29.075 --> 15:31.310
What was your question again?

15:33.179 --> 15:36.615
Oh, my God. Great news...
Donna's not pregnant.

15:36.683 --> 15:38.250
She's not talking to me,

15:38.318 --> 15:39.585
and she kind of hung up on me,

15:39.653 --> 15:41.720
but that click and dead silence

15:41.788 --> 15:44.590
was the most beautiful
sound I ever heard.

15:44.658 --> 15:47.993
Well, what a relief,

15:48.061 --> 15:49.795
but you and I are still having

15:49.863 --> 15:52.965
a good, long talk
about the uterus.

15:54.868 --> 15:58.704
Man, dodged a bullet there, huh?

15:58.772 --> 16:02.941
Almost had a little dumb-ass
running around here, huh?

16:04.544 --> 16:08.147
I'm gonna go throw up now.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.316
You know, you have
been awfully calm

16:11.384 --> 16:12.818
about this whole thing.

16:12.886 --> 16:14.420
You haven't threatened

16:14.487 --> 16:17.823
to put a foot in
anyone's rear all day.

16:17.891 --> 16:20.059
Well, I...

16:20.126 --> 16:22.761
I guess I was kind of looking
forward to having a grandkid.

16:22.829 --> 16:25.464
I mean, since my heart attack,

16:25.532 --> 16:28.033
I've realized at life is short,

16:28.101 --> 16:29.401
and it would be nice

16:29.469 --> 16:31.537
to know my grandkids before I go.

16:31.604 --> 16:34.740
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:34.808 --> 16:37.810
Well, you know, if you're
really disappointed,

16:37.877 --> 16:39.645
we could always ask Laurie.

16:39.713 --> 16:42.214
She might have a few
kids we don't know about.

16:50.925 --> 16:52.259
Simpson, I'm here.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.728
Where's the cat on the trampoline?

16:55.596 --> 16:58.731
Sorry, Michael. There is no cat.

16:58.799 --> 17:01.234
Is there at least a trampoline?

17:01.301 --> 17:03.769
Please have a seat.

17:03.837 --> 17:05.972
Tater tots.

17:06.039 --> 17:07.640
You know, the last time

17:07.708 --> 17:10.242
the hub had tater tots was when...

17:11.712 --> 17:15.548
Suzy, I got your message.
Where's the bouncing kitty?

17:17.684 --> 17:20.319
What's he doing here?

17:20.387 --> 17:23.089
Okay, I've called you here

17:23.156 --> 17:25.724
because it's time you
two talked things over,

17:25.791 --> 17:28.127
and I've used tater
tots to recreate

17:28.194 --> 17:30.329
one of your happiest
times together.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.898
Oh, look!

17:32.966 --> 17:36.535
There's a really big one.

17:36.603 --> 17:41.073
That's not a tater tot.
That's a tater giant.

17:42.242 --> 17:45.378
I look at your jumbo
tot, and I feel nothing.

17:47.447 --> 17:51.350
I, too, resist your tot.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.121
Oh, come on, Michael,

17:55.188 --> 17:57.256
Fez is a great guy.

17:57.324 --> 18:01.627
He's... he's loyal and
sweet and innocent.

18:01.695 --> 18:04.697
And, Fez, Michael's great, too.

18:04.765 --> 18:09.035
He's pure and strong and...

18:09.102 --> 18:12.805
More man than I've ever
seen in one pair of pants.

18:12.873 --> 18:14.774
Hey, he's not so pure.

18:14.841 --> 18:17.043
He's expecting a baby
with another woman.

18:17.110 --> 18:19.211
What?!

18:19.279 --> 18:23.416
Well, he's not so innocent.
He's married.

18:23.483 --> 18:28.587
What? Oh, my God.
You're both disgusting!

18:28.655 --> 18:30.656
I don't want either one of you,

18:30.724 --> 18:32.325
and you really missed out,

18:32.392 --> 18:34.327
because I spent a
semester in France,

18:34.394 --> 18:37.263
and I do stuff American
girls think is gross.

18:45.272 --> 18:48.140
Whoa. What was that about?

18:48.208 --> 18:50.743
Yeah. She's flipping out
'cause someone she likes

18:50.811 --> 18:53.045
is married or having
an illegitimate child.

18:53.113 --> 18:56.449
What's she gonna do when
there's real trouble?

18:56.516 --> 18:58.551
Yeah, we're better
off without her.

18:58.618 --> 18:59.885
Yeah.

18:59.953 --> 19:01.887
Wait. "We"?

19:01.955 --> 19:05.191
Ah, I guess I've missed you.

19:05.258 --> 19:07.460
Really? Man, 'cause
I missed you, too,

19:07.527 --> 19:09.395
and, well, I wasn't
trying to steal her.

19:09.463 --> 19:11.230
I wanted her to be with you.

19:11.298 --> 19:15.267
That's okay. I'd rather
have my friend back anyway.

19:18.205 --> 19:20.706
Do you wanna...

19:22.843 --> 19:26.011
I do if you do.

19:26.079 --> 19:28.848
I do.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.481
We are so lucky.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.884
I mean, it's obvious we're
not ready to be parents.

20:04.951 --> 20:06.385
What would we do?

20:06.453 --> 20:08.854
Hey, anything you want.

20:08.922 --> 20:10.623
And by the way,

20:10.690 --> 20:13.526
when I said you could
sell tupperware,

20:13.593 --> 20:16.228
that was just, like, code

20:16.296 --> 20:18.764
for you could be president
of the United States.

20:18.832 --> 20:20.266
I don't believe you,

20:20.333 --> 20:22.268
but I'm too relieved to be mad.

20:22.335 --> 20:23.769
I'll probably bring it up

20:23.837 --> 20:26.238
when we're having a fight
about something else.

20:26.306 --> 20:29.175
Listen, Donna, all I know is,

20:29.242 --> 20:32.044
we can never make
this mistake again.

20:32.112 --> 20:34.613
Yeah, don't worry.
I think we learned our lesson.

20:36.016 --> 20:37.583
Hurry up, Donna.

20:37.651 --> 20:41.520
You're, uh, you're cutting
into your foreplay time.

20:44.791 --> 20:47.359
One second.

20:49.396 --> 20:50.863
Oh, no!

20:50.931 --> 20:52.431
What?! What?!

20:52.499 --> 20:54.967
Just kidding.

20:55.835 --> 20:59.271
That's not funny, Donna.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.606
I can't even do it now.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.415
Yes, I can.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.600
What would a French girl do

21:14.668 --> 21:16.569
that an American girl
would think is gross?

21:17.336 --> 21:20.505
It could be anything.
They eat snails.

21:21.173 --> 21:23.007
Maybe it's foot stuff.

21:23.075 --> 21:24.742
Foot stuff?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.444
What would you do to a foot?

21:26.512 --> 21:29.414
I don't know, like...

21:29.481 --> 21:31.082
Lick it or something.

21:31.150 --> 21:32.984
What is wrong with you?

21:33.052 --> 21:35.753
What are you, some
kind of foot licker?

21:35.821 --> 21:39.323
No. I wouldn't lick.
I would get licked.

21:39.324 --> 21:40.924
Oh God! Why did I say that?
