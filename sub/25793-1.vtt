WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.844
For we are opposed
around the world

00:11.612 --> 00:14.215
by a monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy...

00:15.216 --> 00:17.751
that combines
military, diplomatic,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.155
intelligence, economic, scientific,

00:21.555 --> 00:22.890
and political operations,
President John F. Kennedy

00:23.791 --> 00:26.127
Two Years Before His Assasination
that relies primarily on infiltration,

00:26.860 --> 00:27.895
Two Years Before His Assasination
instead of invasion,

00:28.529 --> 00:30.898
on subversion,
instead of elections,

00:31.832 --> 00:34.702
on intimidation
instead of free choice,

00:35.269 --> 00:38.539
on guerrillas by night,
instead of armies by day.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.410
Its preparations are
concealed, not published.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.579
Its mistakes are
buried, not headlined.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.117
Its dissenters are silenced,
not praised.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.553
No rumor is printed,
no secret is revealed.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.689
It conducts the
Cold War, in short,

00:56.390 --> 00:57.758
with a wartime discipline

00:58.526 --> 01:01.762
no democracy would
ever hope or wish to match.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.686
Agent Michael Larson.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.822
FBI Case Number 6-7-9-5-2.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.058
Today is November 25, 1983.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.894
Please state your
name and occupation.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.963
My name is Anya Popolovski.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.500
I'm an archival analyst
for the Soviet Embassy

02:12.866 --> 02:13.967
in Washington DC.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.004
Note the Embassy has
agreed to cooperate with us

02:17.137 --> 02:18.206
on this investigation.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.041
Ms. Popolovski...

02:23.477 --> 02:24.645
do you recognize this man?

02:27.114 --> 02:29.850
His name is Timothy Daniels. Ex-CIA.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.953
Defected to Soviet Russia in 1963.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.156
This photo was
taken five days ago.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.093
His file suggests a
connection to you and your father.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.532
This can't be Timothy Daniels.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.934
Why not?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.803
Because Timothy Daniels is dead.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.474
Ms. Popolovski...

02:55.175 --> 02:57.478
I need to impress upon
you that this man is armed

02:57.611 --> 02:58.946
and extremely dangerous.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.148
And any attempt to protect him

03:01.449 --> 03:04.017
will be regarded as treason
by the United States government.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.322
The Cold War was
founded on lies, Agent Larson.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.991
Secrets and lies.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.795
I've made it my
life's work to study

03:14.928 --> 03:16.163
the men who killed my parents.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.369
This is my father,
Alexi Popolovski.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.904
Commander of the
soviet missile corps.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.207
Arthur Blackmark,
the military industrialist.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.678
Timothy Daniels, the spy.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.849
And Gerald Hillcrest.
The man in the shadows.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.688
Put me in witness protection
and I can help you arrest

03:40.821 --> 03:42.423
someone more
dangerous than Daniels.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.692
Who?

03:46.527 --> 03:49.430
The man who killed John F. Kennedy.

03:51.365 --> 03:54.435
World War II created
the two most powerful forces

03:54.568 --> 03:58.639
on earth: the atomic bomb and
the military-industrial complex.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.908
By the end of
the Second World War,

04:01.208 --> 04:02.643
private military contractors

04:02.776 --> 04:04.278
owned the wealthiest corporations

04:04.412 --> 04:07.247
in America. And as the
fear of communism spread,

04:07.481 --> 04:09.750
so did their
influence and power.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.952
Slowly, they began
to use their network

04:12.085 --> 04:14.755
of intelligence operatives
to provoke the Cold War,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.524
locking the United States
and the Soviet Union

04:17.658 --> 04:19.192
in a permanent arms race.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.496
By 1952, nuclear
manufacturer, Gerald Hillcrest

04:22.630 --> 04:23.831
had formed The Consortium,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.434
a group of the eight
most powerful corporations

04:26.567 --> 04:28.436
in the world.
Together they would use

04:28.569 --> 04:31.004
their power and
influence to control the world

04:31.238 --> 04:32.573
with nuclear force.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.785
We must guard against

04:45.285 --> 04:47.455
the acquisition
of unwanted influence,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.256
whether sought or unsought,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.725
by the
military-industrial complex.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.394
In 1962,

04:53.661 --> 04:56.196
Gerald Hillcrest delivered
40 nuclear warheads

04:56.330 --> 04:59.600
to Fidel Castro, sparking
the Cuban Missile Crisis,

04:59.833 --> 05:02.169
bringing the world to
the brink of nuclear war,

05:02.470 --> 05:05.373
changing the course
of history forever.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.510
Then, in 1963,
a second missile crisis,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.680
a secret missile crisis,
began with a phone call

05:13.113 --> 05:14.348
to Timothy Daniels.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.917
Your mission is as follows.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.953
At 11:40 AM local time,
you will use the device

05:20.087 --> 05:22.623
to access Layer Four
of the Russian Defense Network.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.993
At 11:43, you will
access fire control

05:26.126 --> 05:28.829
for Nuclear Ordinance
N-O-1-1-3-6.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.964
You will enter Tier One targets.

05:31.599 --> 05:35.035
At 11:45, you will
engage main firing sequence.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.870
A successful launch

05:37.170 --> 05:39.172
will result in the completion
of Operation Outpost.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.841
Good luck.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.991
He's tapped fire control!
- Safety three offline!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.060
Get me Kirlinkov
and Sergey.

06:00.227 --> 06:05.433
Alexander, move DO-2235
to longitude 1148.001.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.769
Alert Ostrov and Pskov.
- Yes, sir.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.071
Vasily, narrow the band.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.408
You cannot launch
against the Russians,

06:14.542 --> 06:15.843
they will intercept.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.078
They will intercept.
Do you think they're stupid?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.580
Kennedy doesn't even
know what's going on!

06:19.713 --> 06:21.415
Do you think
the Russians are idiots?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.216
You don't even know
what's happened!

06:28.756 --> 06:29.957
Gentlemen.
- Sir.

06:30.591 --> 06:34.562
At 3:45 local time, NO-1136
initiated main firing sequence.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.229
Eastern seaboard.
High level targets.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.731
Washington, Florida, New York.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.567
How many?
- Just the one.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.570
Just one?
- Only one, sir.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.607
This isn't Khrushchev.
- No, sir.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.376
How much time?
- Fifteen minutes.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.044
Safety five offline!

06:51.211 --> 06:53.280
Ebat, somebody
get me abort codes!

06:57.017 --> 06:59.119
The hell, Sergey?
- It's not us.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.221
Codes entered.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.456
Waiting for confirmation.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.759
Abort codes 2-3-X-Z-9-3-D.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.765
Do we take Popolovski?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.934
Depends on the daughter.
- Ethics?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.705
Body count.
- One seventeen against 328.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.940
It's a hell of a lot
better than M.A.D, sir!

07:20.173 --> 07:22.442
No. - No? What
do you mean, no?

07:22.610 --> 07:24.645
Sir, we need to start
priming right goddamn now!

07:24.778 --> 07:25.913
I think they'll intercept.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.282
Thirty three percent.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.787
Abort codes failed.
Interception approved.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.756
I've got a trace!

07:53.206 --> 07:54.474
Team Number Six, with me!

07:57.611 --> 07:59.947
Alexander, you have the floor.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.922
We swing. Get
Daniels on the line.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.891
One hundred twenty-eigh
 million people.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.960
Two million if they intercept.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.428
Three hundred twenty-eight
if we do nothing!

08:18.465 --> 08:19.466
All right.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.972
Hold those codes
until you get my order.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.139
Thank you, sir.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.310
This is Operation Outpost
requesting immediate extraction!

09:03.644 --> 09:05.879
Key in 0-0-1-5-9-12.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.582
Negative. Operation
is compromised!

09:08.849 --> 09:09.983
Stand by.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.720
Mr. Dobrynin, what the hell is this?

09:13.453 --> 09:16.489
Listen, listen. How do I
know what Khrushchev does?

09:16.857 --> 09:20.093
He's like a mad dog.
Always barking, never biting!

09:24.231 --> 09:27.334
That is for breaking my trust.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.172
They're coming.
- Who?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.541
Popolovski.
- Stand by.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.116
Scathe, go ahead.
- T minus five.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.552
And sir, Popolovski came to us.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.258
We have Alexi Popolovski.
- So what?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.260
You're gonna call the Kremlin.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.930
You're gonna tell Khrushchev
to abort his goddamn missile!

10:03.704 --> 10:04.672
They're here.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.606
Sir, we need a decision.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.744
Take him.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.380
Daniels. New deal.
Crimson Curtain.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.054
That's a hit, sir.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.765
Alexander.

10:33.033 --> 10:37.637
I have the device.
Blue box tone generator.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.808
How long?
- Two minutes.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.443
Transmitting tones...

10:44.678 --> 10:45.846
two, five, seven...

10:47.014 --> 10:49.783
three, seven, nine, nine, six, one.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.955
Sergey?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.223
Primer stage still firing.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.691
Nothing, Alexi. Try again!

11:01.294 --> 11:02.730
Found it.
- One minute.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.533
Forty-five seconds!
- Codes?

11:07.100 --> 11:11.038
Two, five, seven, three,
seven, nine, nine, six, one.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.446
Sergey?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.388
Abort successful,
comrade.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.725
Abort successful!
- Abort successful.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.405
Why would the CIA order Daniels

11:45.538 --> 11:47.440
to launch a missile
at his own country?

11:49.009 --> 11:51.011
Daniels only thought
he worked for the CIA.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.013
Thought?

11:53.914 --> 11:56.583
Knowledge, intelligence is power.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.921
Blackmark made his fortune
buying intelligence operatives

12:01.054 --> 12:03.123
from the CIA and
selling their information

12:03.256 --> 12:04.257
to the highest bidder.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.761
Daniels was his operative.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.865
Why have I never
heard of Arthur Blackmark?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.601
You have.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.570
Today, all major
military contractors

12:17.704 --> 12:19.572
are subsidiaries
of his corporation.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.508
Blackmark Enterprises.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.377
But neither Blackmark
nor the CIA

12:24.511 --> 12:25.712
would ever order anyone

12:25.879 --> 12:27.580
to launch a missile
at the United States.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.118
That would be bad for business.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.559
Where are we on the missile?

12:39.726 --> 12:41.494
Khrushchev says it's us.
We say it's them.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.230
We give a response?
- Air Command's pushed

12:43.363 --> 12:44.798
to DEFCON 3, but quietly.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.333
I don't like the idea

12:46.466 --> 12:47.600
of somebody running
around Russia

12:47.734 --> 12:49.636
launching missiles
without telling me first.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.804
Yes, sir.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.739
Doctor Albrecht...

12:53.907 --> 12:56.409
You are interrupting.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.746
I need you in room one.
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.817
Now!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
Do we have
confirmation from Daniels?

13:16.563 --> 13:17.630
He's gone dark, sir.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.600
We swung.
- We missed.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.836
We missed?
- He missed to be precise.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.772
Two years of drills,
two years of training,

13:26.273 --> 13:28.075
two years of
waiting for the exact,

13:28.375 --> 13:30.343
perfect moment
to take Popolovski out!

13:30.543 --> 13:34.181
He shows up on our
doorstep and we missed?

13:35.949 --> 13:36.984
What does McCone say?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.920
Khrushchev says it's us.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.134
It could've been Daniels.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.706
It is my theory...

14:00.640 --> 14:02.575
that, with the help
of this device,

14:02.943 --> 14:07.747
Daniels had access to
the Russian defense network,

14:08.048 --> 14:11.751
and triggered one of
their nuclear launch codes.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.753
Why launch a missile
at your own country?

14:14.054 --> 14:16.523
Sir. Two submarines
carrying Polaris missiles

14:16.656 --> 14:17.857
just went dark in the North Sea.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.561
Any signs of an attack?
- No.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
If Kennedy moves
missiles back into Turkey,

14:26.599 --> 14:29.369
we will have nuclear
war within 72 hours.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.373
Daniels is our priority.
We find him,

14:34.374 --> 14:37.044
we take Popolovski out,
we stop this from escalating.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.678
Dr. Albrecht.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.847
Yes, sir.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.892
Mr. Blackmark.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.596
Gerald.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.200
Good to see you.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.436
Get out of my office.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.247
Cigar?
- No.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.253
You know what
these remind me of?

15:22.155 --> 15:23.123
Cuba.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.128
Do you remember
Bolshakov's message?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.097
The one from Khrushchev?

15:31.031 --> 15:32.199
"Under no circumstances

15:32.332 --> 15:35.768
will surface-to-surface
missiles be sent to Cuba."

15:38.271 --> 15:40.140
I had such high hopes for Cuba.

15:41.841 --> 15:42.809
But...

15:43.943 --> 15:46.446
Castro failed.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.652
The problem is...

15:54.654 --> 15:56.856
for every Castro,
there's a Khrushchev.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.291
For every Khrushchev

15:58.725 --> 16:00.327
there's a Kennedy.
And for every Kennedy...

16:03.063 --> 16:04.031
there's you and me.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.002
When Gods wage war...

16:10.837 --> 16:12.172
it's men who must die.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.641
What do you want?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.644
I hear Kennedy...

16:21.581 --> 16:23.016
is looking at Turkey again.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.790
There are four horsemen, Arthur.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.661
You, me, and everyone else.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.365
It's time that we play our part.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.157
Mary. Get me John McCone.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.273
Who gave you the codes?

17:30.883 --> 17:35.021
There are 692.000
total combinations

17:35.188 --> 17:37.924
across our defense network.

17:38.658 --> 17:43.996
It would mathematically take
1.359 days to force just one

17:44.731 --> 17:47.800
of the nine digits
in the firing sequence.

17:48.168 --> 17:52.439
So, again, who
gave you the codes?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.112
Do you know why
Khrushchev doesn't ride

17:59.246 --> 18:00.280
in a helicopter?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.283
Stop me if you've
heard this one, but... ah!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.625
Who gave you the codes, Daniels?

18:14.861 --> 18:15.828
You did.

18:22.902 --> 18:23.903
You're here...

18:25.938 --> 18:27.274
to protect your people.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.988
Who gave you the codes?

18:45.858 --> 18:46.826
I'm sorry.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.006
Please.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.510
It's my daughter's birthday.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.379
No more blood.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.450
Tell me who you work for.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.852
How is Anya?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.334
I love this game, Daniels...

19:28.735 --> 19:30.937
between you and I,

19:32.339 --> 19:35.675
between our countries,
but there are rules.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.945
When you break the rules,

19:40.447 --> 19:41.714
there are consequences.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.325
This is business.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.730
It is not personal and
we do not involve family.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.841
Goodbye, Timothy Daniels.
- Benzolpenocticide!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.345
I have a medicine.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.915
A medicine banned
by the Soviet Union.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.285
A medicine your daughter needs!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.354
Benzolpenocticide?
- Yes.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.023
It's a fair trade.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.876
Do you know why
Khrushchev doesn't ride

20:44.043 --> 20:44.911
in a helicopter?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.597
Okay, Daniels.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.468
You first.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.282
For Anya.
- No, it's morphine.

22:26.045 --> 22:30.417
She'll need more.
And it comes every day at three.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.820
If you want it.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.122
I see.

22:39.959 --> 22:40.960
Keep an eye on him.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.760
Every time we play
the escalation game,

23:13.993 --> 23:17.930
we get one step closer
to mutually assured destruction!

23:18.397 --> 23:21.067
Kennedy needs a response.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.069
Any sign that we
are moving missiles

23:23.235 --> 23:26.372
back into Turkey will be
enough to set Khrushchev off!

23:26.839 --> 23:30.142
And then we will be right back
where we were last October.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.112
They were this close.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.782
To firing on New York City.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.951
Now, you sit down.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.026
What if I told you...

23:47.860 --> 23:50.463
that I could end
the Cold War tonight?

23:55.902 --> 23:56.903
You're serious?

23:58.538 --> 24:01.040
What do you know
about Alexi Popolovski?

24:01.841 --> 24:04.210
He's a hand in nuclear affairs.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.813
Bit of a pesky fellow.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.916
Runs stings on all of
our agents but minor player.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.284
Have you ever
found his fail-safe?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.488
His fail-safe?
- Back in the days of Stalin...

24:17.056 --> 24:20.827
people of political importance,
who didn't want to get the ax,

24:20.993 --> 24:23.530
would incentivize
their livelihoods.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.533
Blackmail, loyalty lines,

24:27.466 --> 24:30.102
things that could be
released or destroyed

24:30.737 --> 24:32.104
on the event of their deaths.

24:39.445 --> 24:41.981
Take a guess what
Alexi Popolovski's is.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.594
How did we not catch this?

24:56.663 --> 25:00.867
Your boys and my boys
play different games, John.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.136
Does KGB know about this?

25:05.237 --> 25:06.205
No.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.076
What do you need?

25:10.810 --> 25:14.213
I need a team.
Six, from Russia,

25:14.781 --> 25:16.515
ready to make
a discretionary strike

25:16.649 --> 25:17.684
at my command.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.251
I'll make the call.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.056
I need to run this up
the chain. Especially now!

25:24.991 --> 25:26.425
Especially after Dulles.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.028
Do not talk to the
President about this.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.202
What exactly is it
that you don't want

25:36.335 --> 25:37.604
the president to know, Arthur?

25:38.404 --> 25:41.808
John, there are
things I do for you...

25:43.610 --> 25:45.578
that even you don't
want to know about.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.581
This stays between us.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.184
You know how to reach me.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.258
Something about this
rings very bad to me, Arthur.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.095
California Shipbuilding, John.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.934
You don't profit
from a war like this.

26:09.836 --> 26:10.837
No one does.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.228
Blackmark was the youngest member

26:36.362 --> 26:37.797
of the Consortium.
- Clear.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.431
Handpicked
by Gerald Hillcrest

26:39.565 --> 26:40.599
to become its leader.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.470
But the Cuban Missile Crisis
had turned Blackmark

26:44.603 --> 26:46.072
and Hillcrest
against each other.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.975
And McCone's
unwillingness to cooperate

26:49.175 --> 26:51.210
affirmed what
Blackmark feared most...

26:52.611 --> 26:55.547
that Hillcrest was trying
to start a new world war.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.985
All he needed
was a little proof.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.501
Must you be so obvious, Arthur?

27:19.338 --> 27:21.107
How much did you pay McCone?

27:23.275 --> 27:25.878
You came here
to talk politics?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.380
He said that he met someone...

27:29.115 --> 27:31.718
who was hired to
sink an Onassis ship.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.822
Now, why would
anybody wanna do that?

27:37.289 --> 27:38.725
It's what I'm here to find out.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.161
You know, you could
lose your holdings for this.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.496
Or I could kill you.

27:45.564 --> 27:49.001
And isn't that
really why you came?

27:50.102 --> 27:52.705
No. Oh, not yet.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.342
This is a gift.

27:59.611 --> 28:00.813
Token of our friendship.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.683
It's from the masthead
of the Stiletto.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.057
You know, you...

28:12.491 --> 28:15.527
you still manage to
surprise me, Arthur.

28:17.997 --> 28:18.998
Sir...

28:22.568 --> 28:23.936
We found something
you need to see.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.205
Good evening, Gerald

28:29.408 --> 28:30.409
Oh, Arthur...

28:34.480 --> 28:36.682
We'll be having
Thanksgiving early this year.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.685
I hope you can be there.

28:51.697 --> 28:52.698
This way, sir.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.236
In 1962, the United States
had missile bases

28:57.369 --> 28:58.604
along the Turkish coast,

28:59.038 --> 29:01.540
less than 300 miles
from the Soviet Union.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.177
As part of the resolution
to the Cuban Missile Crisis,

29:05.744 --> 29:08.180
Kennedy agreed to remove
his missiles from Turkey.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.382
And just as soon as he did,

29:10.883 --> 29:12.718
Hillcrest replaced
them with his own.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.889
If Khrushchev thought Kennedy
had gone back on his word...

29:17.990 --> 29:20.259
the result could only be war.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.474
Vatrushka?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.651
Have you ever seen the lights
of the Kremlin at night?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.222
Of course.

30:24.790 --> 30:25.791
No, no, no.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.527
Have you really
looked at the lights?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.965
Read the message in the lights?

30:36.869 --> 30:38.170
You know how Stalin died?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.172
Da.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.741
We are going to
go the same way.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.846
I have read the
message in the lights.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.720
Kennedy's in Turkey.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.731
Defense Condition Two.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.234
Set quietly.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.344
He never left, Alexi.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.119
I need information.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.890
Brunt...

31:34.160 --> 31:35.461
I may need to leave.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.397
Where?

31:39.498 --> 31:40.599
Not like that.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.573
I don't envy you, Alexi...

31:49.341 --> 31:52.111
after what they did to Anya.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.250
But my uncle,
he went to Lubyanka.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.120
He's dead now.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.623
Da.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.095
I will keep them off
your back as long as I can.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.098
Always at your service.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.575
Stay safe, comrade.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.466
He has the photographs?
- Of course.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.369
And?

32:50.536 --> 32:51.503
He said something strange.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.973
He needs to go dark. He wants
to disappear for a few days.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.942
Then he's right
where we want him.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.978
Did he give you anything?

33:02.114 --> 33:05.351
Only a syringe.
- Then he has Daniels.

33:06.318 --> 33:10.322
Exactly. Perhaps I can
acquire both assets, same time

33:11.157 --> 33:12.458
Well, prepare the extraction.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.661
But be sure to
keep me closely informed.

33:15.894 --> 33:16.862
Thank you, sir.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.746
My father had a choice.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.983
Turn Daniels in
and give up my cure,

33:38.617 --> 33:42.488
or use him for his medicine
and risk being caught by the KGB.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.041
Hello?
- Brunt...

34:04.210 --> 34:05.244
what did you find?

34:05.977 --> 34:08.414
The drug is real.
Benzolpenocticide.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.149
I think it will stop
the infection,

34:10.382 --> 34:12.650
maybe heal her scars.
But be careful.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.186
I have to go, comrade.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.110
Anya.

34:59.965 --> 35:03.269
I love you so much,
my little zaichik.

35:35.934 --> 35:36.968
Anya...

35:38.604 --> 35:39.605
Anya!

35:41.673 --> 35:43.675
Anya.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.312
Anya, Anya.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.646
Anya!

35:47.979 --> 35:49.648
Anya! Anya!

35:53.852 --> 35:54.820
Shh!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.692
It's okay, it's okay.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.319
I was my father's
greatest weakness.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.560
Me, too.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.099
Tell me about Hillcrest.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.702
Why provoke
Khrushchev and Kennedy?

36:45.003 --> 36:46.872
War, paranoia, fear...

36:47.806 --> 36:48.907
they were good for business.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.244
But Hillcrest wanted more.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.214
By escalating tensions
between the two countries,

36:56.748 --> 36:59.618
Hillcrest hoped to draw
out and eliminate anyone...

37:00.319 --> 37:01.753
who might threaten his power.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.258
When he ordered Daniels
to launch a Soviet missile,

37:07.359 --> 37:09.528
he wasn't starting a war
between the United States

37:09.661 --> 37:10.762
and the Soviet Union.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.599
He was starting
a war on Blackmark.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.202
Can somebody tell
me what the hell this is?

37:18.837 --> 37:22.007
Sir, CIA leaked our intel.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.710
KGB's looking for Popolovski.

37:26.678 --> 37:27.679
I'll get McCone.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.849
All right. Every mole
in the USSR

37:30.982 --> 37:33.585
is about to find out
about Popolovski's fail-safe.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.922
And when they do, Khrushchev
is gonna shut it down so fast

37:37.188 --> 37:38.624
we won't have time to blink.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.460
But if we kill Popolovski
before his abort codes change,

37:41.593 --> 37:43.161
we end the Cold War.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.464
I need to know
where Daniels is. Now.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.099
His signal just went online.
- Give me a timetable.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.235
Twelve hours for the
information to disseminate,

37:50.369 --> 37:51.903
twenty more
until the codes change.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.072
Thirteen-hour flight
each way. - Options?

37:54.406 --> 37:56.442
Air drop in Potapovo?
- Forty-five klicks?

37:56.608 --> 37:58.310
Checkpoints.
- What about Moscow?

37:58.444 --> 37:59.445
Political mail run?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.112
Might work.
Will the embassy buy it?

38:01.246 --> 38:03.682
What about Black Division?
- Not ready yet, sir.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.818
I can get us in.
- How?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.887
We've been tracking
for special activities.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.156
Deep cover smuggling
operation with the Soviets.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.124
Where?
- Poltava, Ukraine.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.994
Idaho.
- Sir?

38:16.595 --> 38:17.596
Vodka.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.333
It could work.
- Turnaround time on the plane?

38:21.600 --> 38:24.135
Four hours. Touch down
five miles South of Moscow.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.405
No check points.
- It'll piss off McCone.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.640
He'll pull our contract.
- I won't let him.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.509
What's our cover?
- E 'n' A mission?

38:30.709 --> 38:32.578
Reiner should buy that.
- I buy it.

38:33.211 --> 38:36.782
All right, let's play ball.
Operation code named "Idaho."

38:37.082 --> 38:38.784
I want our boys
airborne within the hour.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.386
Marshall makes the call.
- Yes, sir.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.120
Copy.
- Excuse me.

39:14.252 --> 39:15.854
Operation code named Idaho.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.625
Tactical squad armed,
moving on the apartment.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.795
Thank you. Counter
Operation Code Breadbasket.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.964
And find out what
Albrecht is working on.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.467
Yes, sir.
- That's excellent work, Scathe.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.301
You keep me posted.

39:39.645 --> 39:40.646
Wake up.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.385
You killed my daughter!
- Your daughter's fine.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.889
You poisoned her!
- Benzolpenocticide.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.192
Its side effects are violent,
but the drug itself is harmless.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.262
No, Mr. Popolovski.
I play by the rules.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.632
Liar!

40:20.318 --> 40:22.521
I need you to help me
understand what's going on here.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.789
Maybe we can...

40:25.023 --> 40:26.424
work out some kind of deal.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.932
Why does the CIA want you dead?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.879
Hello?

40:48.013 --> 40:48.847
Prepare
for delivery.

40:49.414 --> 40:52.317
Code Breadbasket.
- Copy that.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.136
You have one hour.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.318
Hello?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.050
Don't open it!

42:01.653 --> 42:02.821
You're not on my list.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.223
I'm compiling a report
for Weapons Development.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.159
Arthur did not inform me.

42:08.393 --> 42:10.495
They're asking
about isotope penetration.

42:12.530 --> 42:17.035
Ah. I have just finished
the final adjustment.

42:18.770 --> 42:22.674
Isotope penetration
has increased...

42:24.710 --> 42:25.844
twelve percent.

42:27.512 --> 42:28.580
Now...

42:29.380 --> 42:31.049
wait till you see this.

42:31.516 --> 42:33.885
The first ever
radio chemical weapon.

42:36.855 --> 42:37.856
Now watch...

42:38.890 --> 42:40.325
you see?

42:40.491 --> 42:42.327
Twelve thousand rads.

42:42.828 --> 42:45.330
Delivered
in a highly concentrated dose

42:45.964 --> 42:51.102
in human subjects, the
results are exponentially better.

42:51.369 --> 42:52.403
Is it enough?

42:54.172 --> 42:57.242
This weapon could
kill a man in 15 seconds.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.279
Provided he is
in a 20 foot radius

43:01.412 --> 43:04.449
and has not been injected
with my antidote serum.

43:06.351 --> 43:07.886
I will inform Blackmark
immediately.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.489
Herr Scathe!

43:13.859 --> 43:17.495
Never enter my laboratory
again without permission.

43:18.063 --> 43:19.064
Yes, Dr. Albrecht.

44:02.607 --> 44:04.642
You know, I fought with
your cousin during the war.

44:20.859 --> 44:21.860
We were...

44:23.461 --> 44:26.597
on a joint operation
together at Ravensbruck.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.369
He talked about
you a lot. He said that...

44:33.271 --> 44:34.605
you were a brave man.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.279
I'm sure your daughter
would probably agree.

44:57.328 --> 44:59.731
Have you ever been
to Boston in the fall?

45:00.198 --> 45:01.399
I prefer New Hampshire.

45:02.734 --> 45:06.604
Hmm, children. Please,
I don't have much time.

45:07.572 --> 45:09.574
My name is
Bruntoshkow Molotowski,

45:09.707 --> 45:12.010
Central Intelligence.
You may call me Brunt.

45:12.377 --> 45:13.511
Predatel!

45:13.644 --> 45:15.781
It's the nature of our game.

45:15.981 --> 45:17.115
You know this, Alexi.

45:17.415 --> 45:19.951
Wait. You know him?
- Well, da. Professionally.

45:20.852 --> 45:23.755
New orders, Daniels.
Popolovski lives.

45:25.623 --> 45:29.928
Yeah. Alexander Kordakov
discovered his fail-safe.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.696
What fail-safe?

45:32.297 --> 45:33.598
You don't know?
- No.

45:33.965 --> 45:37.068
And we work
for intelligence agency!

45:37.803 --> 45:39.337
If Popolovski dies,

45:39.838 --> 45:42.707
abort codes are sent directly
to Department of Defense.

45:42.874 --> 45:45.376
To what missiles?
- All of them.

45:46.044 --> 45:47.412
But is useless now.

45:48.313 --> 45:51.749
Alexander discovered the codes,
so they're being changed.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.552
But still this
information is valuable.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.654
Worth something
to President Jack.

45:59.290 --> 46:00.658
What do you want
me to do with this?

46:01.860 --> 46:03.829
Keep him here,
keep him alive...

46:04.963 --> 46:06.764
while I arrange extraction.

46:08.433 --> 46:09.434
Hmm.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.671
Hmm. Ah, I will
call you on the 20th.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.142
Code word remains Breadbasket.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.477
All other operations
have been terminated.

46:20.111 --> 46:24.615
If they use any other code
word you can assume it is a threat!

46:26.784 --> 46:29.754
Oh, and please,
lock the damn door.

46:30.521 --> 46:33.224
Keep him alive.
Wait for my call.

46:51.376 --> 46:53.244
That day,
Blackmark's red phone rang

46:53.378 --> 46:55.413
for the first time
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

46:56.915 --> 46:58.616
His team had arrived in Moscow.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.786
And his worst fears
were about to come true.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.857
Sir, Khrushchev
found out about the missiles.

47:06.357 --> 47:08.293
We're piping the call
into the war room now.

47:08.459 --> 47:09.827
Mr. President,

47:09.961 --> 47:12.297
can you tell me why
my intelligence shows

47:12.463 --> 47:14.465
there are still
ten nuclear missiles

47:14.599 --> 47:15.934
on the Turkish coast?

47:16.067 --> 47:17.835
Mr. Khrushchev,
I have seen those reports.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.404
Those are not our missiles!

47:19.604 --> 47:21.539
Then whose missiles
are they, Mr. President?

47:21.873 --> 47:23.141
We had an agreement.
- Dammit.

47:23.308 --> 47:25.343
All our missiles
were removed last October.

47:25.610 --> 47:27.178
We have nothing
to gain from war.

47:27.312 --> 47:29.847
Then why did you
order your American agent

47:29.981 --> 47:32.850
to launch a Soviet missile
at the United States?

47:33.018 --> 47:35.020
I neither ordered
nor condoned

47:35.186 --> 47:36.387
any such operation.
- Lies!

47:36.621 --> 47:38.856
If you do not remove
your missiles from Istanbul...

47:38.990 --> 47:40.491
Damage control?
- we will be forced

47:40.625 --> 47:41.526
to destroy you...
- Nothing we can do.

47:41.659 --> 47:43.895
...city by city. State by state.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.965
Until there is nothing
left of your country

47:47.132 --> 47:48.466
but death and ashes!

47:48.599 --> 47:50.235
If you launch a
single missile at our country,

47:50.368 --> 47:52.537
I will unleash the full force
of this nation against you!

47:52.670 --> 47:55.306
Our nuclear missiles
are prepared to launch now.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.475
Remove your missiles,
Mr. President.

47:57.642 --> 47:59.377
You have 72 hours.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.046
Put a lid on the press.

48:02.313 --> 48:03.281
Lean on them.

48:04.749 --> 48:06.584
Shut it down
before anyone finds out.

48:06.985 --> 48:07.919
Yes sir.

48:35.713 --> 48:37.382
I want to see my family.

48:46.691 --> 48:48.459
Do you know why
Khrushchev doesn't ride

48:48.593 --> 48:51.062
in a helicopter?
- We need to get out of Moscow.

48:52.897 --> 48:57.635
When Khrushchev came to
America he rode in a... Marine One.

49:00.338 --> 49:02.107
And he loved that
helicopter so much

49:02.240 --> 49:03.574
he wanted one for himself.

49:05.543 --> 49:07.445
But his advisors refused.

49:09.780 --> 49:10.781
They said...

49:12.050 --> 49:15.020
Soviet helicopters
weren't safe enough.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.798
There's no missile gap, Alexi.

49:30.335 --> 49:31.469
We've always been ahead.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.308
How long have you been here?

49:39.977 --> 49:42.347
Five years, eight
months, six days.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.636
How did you get such good vodka?

50:09.640 --> 50:10.975
Idaho Potatoes.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.912
Yeah. Khrushchev
smuggles 'em in.

50:15.946 --> 50:17.148
Keeps the people happy.

50:25.556 --> 50:26.724
Somebody's coming.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.834
Hello?
- Prepare for extraction.

50:37.268 --> 50:39.804
Operation code?
- Idaho.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.240
Yes, sir.

50:44.942 --> 50:45.910
What's going on?

50:49.880 --> 50:52.049
What is it?
- I don't know.

50:53.618 --> 50:54.719
Take that.

50:58.223 --> 51:00.525
Are you seriously
trusting me with a shotgun

51:00.991 --> 51:04.762
Yes. If I start
screaming, start shooting.

51:05.130 --> 51:06.197
Let's move to the closet.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.473
We're on site.
Red light? Green light?

51:17.742 --> 51:19.644
Green light.
Operation is a go.

51:20.211 --> 51:21.212
Copy.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.657
Timothy Daniels?
- Yes?

51:33.258 --> 51:34.425
Operation Idaho.

51:35.793 --> 51:36.927
What was that passphrase again?

51:39.364 --> 51:40.431
Idaho, sir.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.401
We have the extraction
orders right here.

51:47.938 --> 51:48.973
Right. Come in.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.121
There's no sign
of Popolovski.

52:04.255 --> 52:05.756
Looks like there's
a code mix-up.

52:06.457 --> 52:09.660
These orders mention,
uh, Alexi Popolovski?

52:10.395 --> 52:12.297
Yes, sir. We're
on an E 'n' A mission,

52:12.463 --> 52:13.598
Popolovski's the target.

52:14.899 --> 52:15.866
Haven't seen him.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.839
Popolovski's been here.
Daniels is claiming otherwise.

52:22.507 --> 52:23.508
Then find him!

52:26.277 --> 52:27.812
Eastman, keep an eye on him.

52:28.713 --> 52:30.615
Arlen, Scott, you're with me.

53:05.850 --> 53:06.884
Now!

53:24.535 --> 53:26.103
We're taking heavy
fire from both Daniels

53:26.237 --> 53:27.171
and Popolovski.

53:30.241 --> 53:32.176
Request regroup
and support. - Negative.

53:32.377 --> 53:35.212
Reiner, there's no time.
You fail, we're at war.

53:38.416 --> 53:39.417
Hey.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.428
Who is this?

53:50.595 --> 53:51.696
This is your handler,
Mr. Daniels.

53:51.962 --> 53:54.665
What's going on?
Why are you refusing extraction?

53:54.799 --> 53:57.335
Your agents didn't give
the correct passphrase!

53:57.535 --> 54:00.204
I'm under new orders
to keep Popolovski alive.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.373
Negative. Popolovski
is the target.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.442
I can change the
parameters of my mission.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.411
Just give me
the correct passphrase!

54:06.544 --> 54:08.413
I can give you
additional identification.

54:08.746 --> 54:11.349
What is the passphrase?
- Idaho!

54:11.749 --> 54:14.819
I am ordering you
to kill Popolovski, Daniels!

54:37.708 --> 54:40.244
Popolovski's codes will
be changed within the hour.

54:47.585 --> 54:48.986
We are 72 hours away

54:49.119 --> 54:50.488
from Mutually Assured Destruction.

54:51.389 --> 54:52.423
Let's start the clock.

54:54.024 --> 54:55.125
Marshall, Hiller...

54:56.794 --> 54:58.262
begin reviewing
lockdown procedures

54:58.396 --> 54:59.830
and establishing
containment zones.

55:01.366 --> 55:02.333
Copy that.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.335
Hillcrest couldn't let Blackmark

55:04.535 --> 55:06.270
activate my father's fail-safe.

55:08.406 --> 55:11.776
And four innocent
men died... because of it.

55:13.578 --> 55:15.279
Fearing the shootout
would attract

55:15.446 --> 55:16.547
unwanted attention,

55:17.147 --> 55:19.316
Daniels decided to
keep my family together,

55:19.950 --> 55:20.851
in one place.

55:22.086 --> 55:24.955
And so, we prepared
for Brunt's extraction...

55:25.523 --> 55:28.993
as the threat of nuclear
war loomed on the horizon.

55:36.834 --> 55:38.335
When are we going,
Papa?

55:41.271 --> 55:42.707
Soon, Anya.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.411
Will America hate us?
- No.

55:47.645 --> 55:49.780
But why does America hate us?

55:52.483 --> 55:55.486
Because we hate them.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.455
Why, Papachika?

55:59.590 --> 56:00.558
Because...

56:03.127 --> 56:04.328
a long time ago...

56:07.432 --> 56:08.399
we were friends.

56:10.801 --> 56:14.304
But then we started
to keep secrets.

56:16.106 --> 56:17.374
And build walls.

56:20.310 --> 56:22.346
Never build walls.

56:23.748 --> 56:26.551
I like secrets.
- Hush, Anya.

56:37.828 --> 56:38.796
Are you ready?

57:41.926 --> 57:43.794
Stalin's heart stopped.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.665
Turn off your recorder.

57:52.102 --> 57:53.237
I have a proposal.

57:56.941 --> 57:57.942
What are you terms?

57:59.109 --> 58:00.110
Reconstruction.

58:01.746 --> 58:03.247
Your industries are suffering.

58:03.881 --> 58:06.150
The eastern drought,
the missile gap.

58:07.785 --> 58:09.920
I can give you
everything we have.

58:11.756 --> 58:14.659
In exchange, we get cash flow.

58:15.893 --> 58:17.628
Buried in our foreign accounts.

58:19.129 --> 58:21.632
I stay active,
in the United States.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.302
I get Khrushchev's ear...

58:27.638 --> 58:30.675
and I make sure he keeps
his army out of West Berlin.

58:32.977 --> 58:34.545
I wish we were for sale.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.052
He came to us first.

58:43.954 --> 58:45.189
Gerald Hillcrest.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.095
We can offer you protection.

58:52.329 --> 58:54.198
I have seen your protection.

58:57.768 --> 59:02.239
Even if you could
nullify this contract...

59:03.774 --> 59:06.243
nobody controls Khrushchev.

59:08.946 --> 59:10.715
I think
there are only two ways...

59:12.349 --> 59:13.684
to end this crisis.

59:14.719 --> 59:17.554
Either find a new premiere...

59:19.023 --> 59:21.058
or you elect a new president.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.036
You know...

59:34.038 --> 59:35.740
I called my wife today.

59:41.378 --> 59:44.114
If this is our last
meeting, Mr. Dobrynin,

59:45.783 --> 59:46.784
it's been a pleasure.

59:50.688 --> 59:53.457
An absolute pleasure, Arthur.

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:03.768
Sorry about the wrist.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.068
The com chatter...

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.570
has us about...

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.439
50 hours out.

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.576
So I figured... Ah.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:55.946
We'd find out
who this belongs to.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.849
Can you tell me
something, Daniels?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.285
It's not CIA,

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:05.155
and it's too modern to be KGB.
I can probably use it to, uh,

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:10.027
tap the American trunk line,
maybe abort one or two missiles.

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:12.930
Why launch a missile...

01:02:13.998 --> 01:02:15.032
at your own country?

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.101
'Cause I had my orders.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:21.671
And you never question orders?

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:24.074
What are you gettin' at?

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.445
Did you...

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:30.614
ever think...

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:34.251
that we caused this war?

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.654
Pass me the cutters.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:43.794
Men like us who follow orders?

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:56.606
I operate under the impression
that if my commanding officer

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.642
orders me to launch
a nuclear strike

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.810
at my own country...

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.579
It's for a damn good reason.

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:06.917
But who is...

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.153
your commanding officer?

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:17.327
I know Brunt.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.998
He doesn't work for the CIA.

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.267
Well, maybe he's a double agent.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.969
Are you sure?

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:28.805
Damn it.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.978
What if, Daniels...

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:37.314
what if you have been
working for the Politburo

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:38.615
this entire time?

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.520
What if it was Khrushchev
who ordered you to launch

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.055
that miss...?
- That's enough.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.325
What if you don't
even work for the CIA?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.195
You said it yourself,

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.563
you've never seen
a radio like this before.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:03:57.067
What if your loyalty...

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.973
started a war that would
end the life of my daughter...

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:06.977
my family, of my country?
- I said that's enough!

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.647
What if you had killed me?

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:27.031
I watched your cousin...

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:31.135
lead a platoon of men
to their death at Ravensbruck.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.471
I followed my orders.
I kept my head down.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.406
He died, I lived!

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:42.079
Alexi, I would
give everything...

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:47.217
everything I have
to stop this war.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.221
What country, Daniels?

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.960
What sacrifice?
- Sacrifice?

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.363
What about Anya?

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.033
I made a mistake.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:10.374
They burnt her face!
- I learned my lesson.

01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:13.110
I do this...

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:15.512
for your daughter.

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:20.184
For all the Anya's in the world

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:23.087
that are hiding
behind the Iron Curtain.

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:29.093
That's why I joined the CIA.
And that's why I follow orders.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.599
Blackmark Enterprises.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.505
Put a burn notice out on Daniels.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.508
He's no use to us now.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:47.978
Let the KGB handle him.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.623
You are not...

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.959
who you think you are...

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:07.597
Timothy Daniels.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.438
Go take care of your family, Alexi.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.290
By taking away
all of his options,

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.625
Hillcrest left Blackmark
with only two ways

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:37.194
to stop the clock.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.296
Find a new premiere...

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.499
or elect a new president.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:46.903
If we have a sniper...
- Do agree

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:50.340
with your first premise.
Poison is not an option.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:54.911
What I need from you
is the name of your top con...

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:08.925
Yes?
- They're holding a meeting.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.528
Something big.
Arthur's keeping me in the dark.

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.200
Does he know anything?
- I'm not sure.

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.169
Albrecht's building
a radio-chemical weapon.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:22.672
There's an antidote serum.
Are we ready to move forward?

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.476
No. We need the serum first.
Move quickly, Scathe.

01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:32.816
What are you doing in here?
- Just a smoke.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:34.918
Hmm.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:36.720
Yeah. Me, too.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.094
Can I be candid with you, Scathe?

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.429
Of course, sir.

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.967
I miss sleep.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.410
Being able to turn off
my light...

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:05.215
and go to bed knowing the
world is gonna be here tomorrow.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:15.392
I used to believe in
the promise of America.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:20.729
What do you believe in, Scathe?

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:23.533
Freedom, sir.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.304
Freedom?

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:30.707
Yeah.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.943
Me, too.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:40.317
It's why I trust you.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:49.826
Let's get back to work.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:06.475
Mr. Oswald
is here to see you.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.613
Send him in.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.151
This way.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.526
Mr. Oswald.
- Call me Lee.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.630
Scotch?
- No.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.167
Tell me about your time in...
- I can't tell you about Russia.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:34.871
Why not?

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:37.674
Client confidentiality.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:45.948
You were stripped of
your sharpshooter status?

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:47.984
Sergeant didn't like me.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:57.160
And I take it you
are comfortable with...

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:00.196
high-level targets?
- I believe I am.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.068
And it should go
without saying that anything

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.036
that we say in this room
- You know, I am nothing

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.171
if not professional.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.443
Double your rate,
no questions asked.

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:18.348
But I'm gonna have
to have you sign something...

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.084
before I give you the name.

01:10:23.186 --> 01:10:26.356
With respect, if
this is a matter of trust...

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:28.325
No, I trust you'll
get the job done.

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.060
Your record makes
that clear. However...

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:35.765
I need you to sign.

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:44.741
This is serious.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:47.744
You said double my rate?

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.948
Okay.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:54.951
Give the name.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.989
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.496
The President
of the United States.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:09.299
Come in.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.937
There's been a development.
With Daniels, sir.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:17.173
KGB is moving on his
apartment within the hour.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:25.415
Scathe.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:28.585
Is everything all right?
- Stay here.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.487
I need your assurance

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:31.655
that this is going...
- Scathe!

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:32.789
to be taken care of!

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:34.958
Somebody find me Scathe!

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.808
Scathe!

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:56.846
Albrecht?

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:03.720
The serum...

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.887
Shit.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.990
We're leaving now!
- Daniels, what is it?

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.158
They're coming!

01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:49.399
I need her medicine!

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:51.535
What is it?

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:53.236
KGB.
- How do you know?

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:55.705
It's not here.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.530
Brunt. We need to
go now! - I'm on my way.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:54.964
Ten minutes.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:07.644
Dostatochno!

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:24.994
Alexi...

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:31.835
Khrushchev says privet!

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:37.674
No!

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:50.253
Anya...

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:14.711
Come with me.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.654
Where is Alexi?

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:30.894
We'll split up.
There's a car downstairs.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.328
They will give you
passport and money,

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.798
take you directly
to Langley. I...

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:37.300
will take Anya from here.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:41.204
It's okay.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.856
Your father loved...

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:15.304
I need you to do
me a favor, Anya.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:20.977
Keep these safe for me, okay?

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.072
I never said goodbye
to my father.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:54.978
The official report said
your parents died in a fire.

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.215
That night there
was a phone call made

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.383
to the KGB.

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:04.420
I'm sure it was Blackmark.

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.423
You don't think it
could've been Hillcrest?

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:11.060
Blackmark, Hillcrest,
it doesn't matter.

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:16.265
My father died for
wealthy men in a foreign country.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:20.269
Not for glory or honor
but because of their greed.

01:17:22.005 --> 01:17:23.773
This is true evil, Agent Larson.

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:26.375
Men who consume
and destroy for profit.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.379
But my father wasn't enough.

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.449
Blackmark wanted blood.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:38.521
He wanted to
become Gerald Hillcrest.

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.395
Stay close...

01:17:47.864 --> 01:17:49.198
we won't have much time.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.841
Good luck, sir.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.181
Gentlemen.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.353
It is the tradition
of this Consortium

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:12.521
to meet once a
year on Thanksgiving.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:17.193
Hmm. However, due to the...
the present global crisis,

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:20.329
we've been forced to meet early.
First time in our history.

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:23.466
But we're not gonna let
that dampen our mood, are we?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.470
No. It has been
a most eventful year.

01:18:28.671 --> 01:18:31.007
So, let's begin. Brother Mark.

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:47.223
My brothers...

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:50.593
look at what we've created.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.230
We built this country...

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.600
with our sweat and our blood.

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:03.739
We built this administration
with our influence and guile.

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:07.676
And we built this war...

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.248
with our pride and our greed.

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:14.951
Gentlemen, I have a dream.

01:19:16.886 --> 01:19:18.287
I have a vision of the future.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.557
I see war.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:27.831
Endless, ceaseless,
unwinnable and without reason.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.467
I see tall buildings fall.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.670
I see presidents and kings...

01:19:36.039 --> 01:19:39.342
reduced to pawns and jesters.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:46.950
I see fear in the eyes
of every man, woman and child,

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:51.120
as they watch
the stock markets crumble...

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:55.424
as they lose their
homes, their jobs,

01:19:56.292 --> 01:20:00.796
their families. I
see a world crying out...

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:03.466
for a higher power.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.872
Gentlemen.
We are that higher power.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.308
And when the world is ours...

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:17.113
we will profit.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:21.918
And yet...

01:20:24.087 --> 01:20:25.121
and yet...

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:30.994
there are those in this
room who have betrayed me.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.529
That's enough!

01:20:34.898 --> 01:20:37.266
You've played
Khrushchev and Kennedy.

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:40.303
You have worked night and day,

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.271
bringing them
to this boiling point.

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.474
The Bay of Pigs,
the Missile Crisis.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:49.012
Alexi Popolovski
and Timothy Daniels.

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:50.846
And tomorrow...

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.781
finally...

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:56.152
you will bring
the world to an end.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:01.724
Did you think I wouldn't
notice your signature?

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:07.396
What do you think?

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:16.072
Gentlemen...

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:18.441
a toast.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.578
To Gerald Hillcrest.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.885
Enjoy your Thanksgiving.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:58.081
When Gods wage
war, men must die.

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:10.793
You haven't stopped the clock.

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:47.396
Gentlemen.

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:12.088
I'm sorry. Mr. McCone
can't see you right now.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:13.756
He asked me to inform
you that your recording

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.291
doesn't contain
a credible threat,

01:23:15.591 --> 01:23:17.126
and that he has no
record of your employment.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.662
I did manage to find
these in our archives.

01:24:43.379 --> 01:24:45.281
Evacuate
all above ground floors.

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:47.883
Sections B1 through
five proceed immediately

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.618
to your designated
fallout shelters.

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.020
This is not a drill.

01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:53.289
Date and sign, please.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.991
On November 22nd, 1963,

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:58.727
Arthur Blackmark
inherited the seven

01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:01.029
most powerful
corporations in the world.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:05.468
As the soviet missiles
began their final countdown.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.638
As Lee Harvey Oswald
prepared to assassinate

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.874
the president
of the United States.

01:25:34.397 --> 01:25:35.431
You must recite the phrase

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:36.932
to complete the transfer of power.

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:50.379
There is power in darkness.

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:00.856
From darkness I came...

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:04.159
a rider on a black horse.

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:09.898
To judge.

01:26:12.435 --> 01:26:13.502
And to condemn.

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:18.974
Rule the world
with power and authority.

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.146
To claim my inheritance.

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.354
For I am the darkness.

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.256
Listen. Listen!

01:26:34.357 --> 01:26:35.958
I want you to hear
the sound of power.

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:38.327
The sound of death.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:42.197
And the darkness
grows inside of me.

01:27:47.029 --> 01:27:48.196
Shots have been fired

01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:49.765
at the President's
motorcade on its way

01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:52.968
through downtown Dallas.
The suspect is a white male,

01:27:53.135 --> 01:27:55.971
armed, believed to be
carrying a 30-caliber rifle.

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:58.907
Hold on. This just in...

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:04.012
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the President is dead.

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:09.918
He died just moments ago,
at Parkland Hospital, in Dallas.

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:15.491
Scathe killed Daniels
to keep the world from ending,

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.192
and then he went into hiding.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.161
In fear of Blackmark.

01:28:20.763 --> 01:28:23.298
Brunt stayed active
in the Soviet Union.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.802
And I was raised
by the Russian ambassador.

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.373
He told me parts of the story.

01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:33.909
I learned the rest on my own.

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:39.982
I want you to find Blackmark
and bring him to justice!

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:44.119
For killing the President.
For killing my father.

01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:45.621
And I want to be placed

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:47.456
in the witness
protection program.

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:51.627
I'm sorry, Anya.

01:28:52.895 --> 01:28:54.162
There's nothing I can do.

01:28:56.799 --> 01:28:58.467
I want to believe you.
But this investigation

01:28:58.601 --> 01:29:00.302
is about Daniels.
Nobody else.

01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:03.305
History repeats
itself, Agent Larson.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:07.342
When the Cold War ends,
a new war will begin.

01:29:07.743 --> 01:29:09.445
And another, and another,

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.647
until Blackmark
controls the world.

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.450
I've never heard
of Arthur Blackmark.

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.619
If you follow the power
in your government, you will...

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:19.688
Dammit, Anya! Do you
or do you not know

01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:21.056
where Timothy Daniels is?

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.062
I took a big risk
involving your embassy

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.631
and I need somethin'
to show for it.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.332
So, if he's dead...

01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:32.468
give me proof.

01:29:46.415 --> 01:29:47.416
Proof.

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:52.120
Daniels' recording of Blackmark
hiring Lee Harvey Oswald.

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:55.290
Bring him to justice.

01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:03.131
Anya...

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:05.768
If this is real...

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:09.438
be very careful
who you can trust.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:14.477
Everyone has a
fail-safe... Agent Larson.

01:30:19.782 --> 01:30:21.116
We could use
more people like you.

01:30:22.551 --> 01:30:23.552
We'll be in touch.

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:38.300
Give me the tape.

01:30:39.902 --> 01:30:40.903
Timothy Daniels.

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.708
Blackmark's been lookin' for you.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.043
Like he was looking for Scathe?

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:50.212
Scathe.

01:30:51.413 --> 01:30:53.048
Do you know what
his last words were,

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:55.751
before I killed him?

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:00.556
"I believe in freedom."

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:10.633
As long as Blackmark's still alive,

01:31:10.866 --> 01:31:12.835
there is no freedom.
Not for me...

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:15.170
not for Anya.

01:31:18.574 --> 01:31:20.342
She almost had me
convinced you were dead.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.921
She lied.
