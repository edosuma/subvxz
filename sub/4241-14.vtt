00:00.601 --> 00:02.168
<i>, here's what you missed on
Glee: Quinn was dating Sam,</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:04.037
<i>but then she kissed Finn, so
Santana told Sam, and now</i>

00:04.104 --> 00:05.805
<i>they've started dating.
You are Biebalicious.</i>

00:05.873 --> 00:08.141
<i>Will's not dating anyone and
says he's over Emma, but it</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:09.676
<i>seems like he's still got a
thing for her, even though
she's married.</i>

00:09.743 --> 00:11.511
<i>Kurt's really into Blaine,
and Blaine likes Kurt,</i>

00:11.579 --> 00:13.146
<i>but he says he just wants to
stay friends.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:15.048
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:18.585
(school bell rings)
Figgins,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.353
you wanted to see me?

00:20.421 --> 00:21.621
William, we have an epidemic
on our hands.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.090
Head lice?
Worse. Giggle juice.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.725
I-I'm sorry. What?

00:25.793 --> 00:27.060
Alcohol, William.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.628
The wet devil.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.762
Our children

00:29.830 --> 00:31.698
are so brazen,
they are showing up

00:31.765 --> 00:32.999
to school wasted.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.934
And not wasted
on learning, Will.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.269
Wasted on booze.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.471
Why, just this week,
we've had five suspensions

00:38.539 --> 00:40.673
for intoxication
on school grounds.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.242
(pounding on window)
Figgins!

00:42.309 --> 00:43.743
You rock!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.278
Yeah, man!

00:45.346 --> 00:47.680
Six suspensions.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.182
I-I don't get it.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.984
Drinking's never been a problem
at this school.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.585
That's because there are
new alcoholic beverages

00:52.653 --> 00:53.886
targeted to kids, Will.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.521
Just listen
to the radio.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.858
Pop music now glorifies
binge drinking.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.059
Just listen to any hit

01:00.127 --> 01:03.229
by pop sensation
Ke-dollar-sign-ha.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.230
Oh. You-You mean Ke$ha?

01:05.299 --> 01:07.100
We must do something
to protect our children, Will.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.935
I-I totally agree.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.570
How-How can I help?

01:10.638 --> 01:12.572
I have decided to make this week

01:12.640 --> 01:13.906
Alcohol Awareness Week

01:13.974 --> 01:15.074
at McKinley.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.476
I have contacted
Kitty Dukakis,

01:16.543 --> 01:18.111
who will be
the guest speaker

01:18.178 --> 01:21.214
at an assembly where your
Glee Club will perform a song

01:21.282 --> 01:23.049
highlighting the dangers

01:23.117 --> 01:24.050
of teenage drinking.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.719
Can I count on you, William?

01:32.026 --> 01:33.259
(school bell ringing)

01:33.327 --> 01:34.894
WILL:
Emma?
Hi.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.262
Enough with us
not being friends.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.131
Look, I heard through the
grapevine that you and Carl

01:38.198 --> 01:39.265
started looking
for a tract house together,

01:39.333 --> 01:40.833
and I just wanted to say

01:40.901 --> 01:43.136
that I'm genuinely
happy for you.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.604
Thank you.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.472
(chuckling)
That's really sweet.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.308
Two-slicer.
(laughs)

01:48.375 --> 01:50.009
Do you want to catch up?

01:50.077 --> 01:52.011
Yeah. Sure.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.913
(clears throat)

01:53.981 --> 01:55.448
How have you been?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.684
Busy. Yeah.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.052
Glee Club's gearing up
for Regionals...

01:59.119 --> 02:01.287
I, um, love hearing
about the Glee Club,

02:01.355 --> 02:02.922
but I'm actually more
interested in you.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.791
You know, how
you're doing.
Me? Uh...

02:04.858 --> 02:06.492
Are you dating anybody?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.227
No.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.530
No?

02:10.597 --> 02:12.365
Maybe you should.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.067
You know,
Ella, I think

02:14.134 --> 02:15.902
Will should really concentrate
on his treatment

02:15.969 --> 02:17.170
before he tries another
relationship

02:17.237 --> 02:19.238
with an early hominid,
even a human female.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.841
Treatment?
Alcoholics Anonymous, Will.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.876
I suggest you
pre-emptively check

02:23.944 --> 02:26.512
into rehab,
as you are a future alcoholic.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.214
I mean, come on.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.216
Look where you are.
You're coaching a Glee Club

02:30.284 --> 02:32.285
that can only beat
choirs of old people.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.221
You're rehashing the details
of your failed marriage

02:35.289 --> 02:38.558
with the very lemur
who rejected the bestial horror

02:38.625 --> 02:39.826
of your craven sexual advances.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.595
And when my Glee Club
crushes you at Regionals,

02:42.663 --> 02:46.099
well, the last ounce of meaning
will drain from your life,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.567
and you will turn to drink.

02:47.634 --> 02:48.801
I don't get it. How is it

02:48.869 --> 02:50.203
that you're now
coaching a Glee Club?

02:50.270 --> 02:52.472
I was so inspired by my stint
in the Glee Club,

02:52.539 --> 02:54.474
that I took the trip
to Westvale,

02:54.541 --> 02:55.708
and I volunteered my help.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.477
Unfortunately,
the chipper homosexual

02:57.544 --> 02:59.045
who coaches Aural Intensity

02:59.113 --> 03:00.880
had a terrible fall
down the stairs.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.782
(epic music plays)

03:05.252 --> 03:07.353
I'm okay. Don't worry.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.691
(grunting)

03:11.759 --> 03:12.992
Not to be alarmed.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.528
Doctors say he will be fine.
Provided they can get

03:15.596 --> 03:16.896
the swelling in his brain
under control.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.031
Okay, sorry. I still
don't understand.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.267
How can the school let
you coach Aural Intensity?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.002
Newsflash, Amelda.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.338
There's no one lining up
to coach Glee Clubs

03:25.406 --> 03:27.240
because it's a sucky job
for losers.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.042
But there was an opening,
and I am a champion.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.378
Oh, Will.
Here's the book by Bill W.,

03:32.446 --> 03:35.181
outlining the 12 steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.983
I can't wait for you
to start climbing those steps,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.217
because when you get to the top,

03:38.285 --> 03:40.686
I'm gonna knock you back down.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.624
(school bell ringing)

03:44.691 --> 03:46.692
What's up, my hot, little
Jewish-American Princess?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.161
What do you want,
Puckerman?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.129
Well, word on the street is
that your dads are out of town,

03:50.197 --> 03:51.297
and you're all
alone in your house.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.965
They are on the
Rosie O'Donnell cruise.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.500
Was that...
Who told you that?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.702
This is the kind of information
a guy like me tends to know.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.272
So, uh, party
this Saturday?

03:59.339 --> 04:00.840
I'll bring the beer ball.
That's a mini-keg.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.675
Forget it.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.076
Oh, come on. Just
the Glee kids.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.378
We're losing our minds,

04:05.446 --> 04:06.245
all stressed
about Sectionals and stuff.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.347
Regionals. Besides,

04:08.415 --> 04:11.050
you just want a place
to have sex and get drunk.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.819
Yeah. There's a word
for that. A party.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.320
No. No.
(notes tinkling)

04:14.388 --> 04:17.290
No. My-My-My dads, they left me
alone in my house

04:17.357 --> 04:18.825
because they trusted me
to be responsible.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.894
They left you alone 'cause you
suck and are a total bore.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.262
FINN:
Hey.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.430
Yo.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.498
How's the song-
writing going?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.100
Hey. It's going amazing.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.102
I think I might have
a really big hit here,

04:30.170 --> 04:31.270
which is why
I wanted you to come by.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.738
I-I want you to hear it.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.373
Oh. Yeah. Cool.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.309
Come here.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.349
(chuckles)

04:46.553 --> 04:47.687
What was that for?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.121
To break the tension.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.557
We were boyfriend
and girlfriend, Finn.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.025
It's silly for us to pretend

04:53.093 --> 04:54.494
like we aren't comfortable
around each other.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.596
Yeah. Totally.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.498
And I know that we have
some unresolved feelings,

04:58.565 --> 05:02.268
but like my two new role models
Carole King and Gerry Goffin,

05:02.336 --> 05:03.603
I think it's important
that we just

05:03.670 --> 05:06.706
put them aside and stay
focused on our mission

05:06.773 --> 05:08.908
which is just
to write an amazing song

05:08.976 --> 05:10.209
to win Regionals with.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.712
Well, I have no idea
who those people are,

05:12.779 --> 05:14.747
but I'm on board.
Let's hear it.
Okay.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.550
It's just... It's a little
rough, but, uh...

05:17.618 --> 05:19.752
(piano ballad playing)
I think it's really special,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.320

06:21.815 --> 06:23.849
Yes.
It's called, "My Headband."

06:23.917 --> 06:25.918
They say you should write
about what you know.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.587
Well, uh...

06:27.654 --> 06:30.222
It's really... interesting,

06:30.290 --> 06:32.658
but it's not...

06:32.726 --> 06:35.528
emotional or,
like, good.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.029
It sucks.
Yeah.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.831
How am I supposed to write
a song like Joni Mitchell

06:38.899 --> 06:40.333
or Carole King?
They've lived.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.436
Well, maybe if you want
to be an artist like them,

06:43.503 --> 06:45.771
you should do a
little living.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.274
You're so right.

06:48.342 --> 06:51.410
I mean, even now,

06:51.478 --> 06:53.646
it-it's Alcohol Awareness Week,

06:53.714 --> 06:56.048
and we're supposed to sing songs
about the dangers of drinking,

06:56.116 --> 06:57.650
and I've never
even had a drink.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.185
Wait, seriously?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.886
That's why I never got
past second base. Wait.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.755
Where are you going?
To find Puckerman.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.291
You know, my journey
from little princess

07:05.359 --> 07:09.061
to natural woman begins this
Saturday night at my house.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.496
(school bell ringing)

07:10.564 --> 07:11.998
That sounds awful.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.232
Is anybody going?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.600
Let me find out.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.502
(phone beeps)
(phone vibrates)

07:16.570 --> 07:17.870
Did you hear?
Yes.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.238
Mercedes just told me.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.406
Tell them I'll
go if they go.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.607
Tell them yourself.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.442
I ain't no pony express.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.777
(headset beeps)
You're going, right?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.245
Only if there's liquor.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.948
Because a Rachel Berry party
is not something I can do sober.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.583
But it's Alcohol
Awareness Week.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.619
Precisely. And I am aware
of how much fun alcohol is.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.987
Let's ask Puckerman.
(phone beeps, phone vibrates)

07:35.055 --> 07:36.222
You're go for Puck.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.556
Noah, it's Santittany
and Artcedes.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.325
Can your friend score us
some wine coolers?

07:39.393 --> 07:41.027
No, but his I.D. can.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.029
Well, if we're all
in, it's settled.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.898
The Rachel Berry House Party
Train Wreck Extravaganza

07:45.966 --> 07:47.633
is officially a go.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.901
♪
♪

07:48.969 --> 07:50.569
Welcome.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.039
Kurt. Blaine.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.875
I wasn't expecting
you guys.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.110
FINN: Kurt's been
blackmailing me

07:58.178 --> 07:59.879
ever since he saw
my browser history.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.580
He kind of
insisted on coming.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.783
I'm totally off
the clock right now, Rachel.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.184
I'm not a Warbler.
I'm just Blaine.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.986
I'm not even
wearing my uniform.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.655
So, this is
your dads' Oscar Room.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.924
Yes. They transformed
our ordinary basement

08:11.992 --> 08:13.559
for our famous
annual Oscar parties.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.127
Is that a stage?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.729
I like to give
impromptu performances

08:16.797 --> 08:18.130
for our neighbors sometimes.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.365
Hey, girlfriend.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.766
Having fun?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.702

08:27.441 --> 08:28.741
Uh, okay. Let's, uh...

08:28.809 --> 08:30.743
Let's go over the rules.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.678
Everybody gets
two drink tickets

08:32.746 --> 08:34.547
to keep things
from getting out of hand.

08:34.614 --> 08:37.082
We're serving
wine coolers today.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.683
That is our
specialty drink.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.320
That's actually
all that we have.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.457
Brittany!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.726
Remember the rules.
No sitting on anything.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.361
Okay. Okay, everybody.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.063
Cheers!

08:51.131 --> 08:52.631
Great party, Rachel.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.233
We got to run.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.868
Yeah, dinner reservations.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.237
But, but, but we haven't
even played Celebrity yet.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.339
I...

09:00.407 --> 09:02.675
Why is everybody leaving?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.977
Because this
party blows.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.880
I haven't even had
my first sip yet.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.648
How am I supposed to
write "Both Sides Now"

09:09.716 --> 09:11.450
if I can't even
throw a party?

09:11.518 --> 09:13.452
Look, if you want
everyone to stay,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.588
you have to let me break into
your dads' liquor cabinet.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.290
No one's gonna get
buzzed off two wine coolers.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.993

10:49.282 --> 10:51.383
I would do anything
for you. Anything!

10:51.451 --> 10:53.085
Okay, Rachel.

Sit down?

10:55.555 --> 10:56.522
I'm going to break
it down for you.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.224
Guys and girls fall

10:58.291 --> 11:01.360

when they get drunk.

11:01.428 --> 11:05.764
Exhibit A-- Santana,
the weepy, hysterical drunk.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.366
You like her
more than me.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.735

awesome and so smart.

have abs.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.668
Well done, you guys.

18:39.735 --> 18:41.136
I mean, you
always bring it

18:41.203 --> 18:42.537
with the singing
and the dancing,

18:42.605 --> 18:43.905
but what I was really
impressed with today

18:43.973 --> 18:45.073
was your acting.

18:45.141 --> 18:46.374
I truly thought

18:46.442 --> 18:47.576
that some of you guys
were drunk.

18:47.643 --> 18:49.177
We take our craft serious.

18:49.245 --> 18:51.313
Problem is, that song is great,

18:51.380 --> 18:54.182
but it-it kind of glorifies
drinking, don't you think?

18:54.250 --> 18:56.117
We're supposed
to sing about the dangers

18:56.185 --> 18:57.852
of alcohol for this assembly.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.155
Well, good luck finding
a song that does that.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.323
RACHEL:
Mr. Shue?

19:01.390 --> 19:03.024
First of all,
that vest is very cute.

19:03.092 --> 19:05.126
You are all kinds of awesome.

19:05.194 --> 19:07.329
But second, maybe
there's really no songs

19:07.396 --> 19:09.764
about the dangers of drinking
because there's really none

19:09.832 --> 19:12.334
as long as you have
a proper designated driver.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.536
I ever told you
how great you are?

19:14.604 --> 19:15.637
Whoa.
WILL:
Well, Rachel, yeah.

19:15.705 --> 19:17.072
Driving drunk
is dangerous.

19:17.139 --> 19:19.374
And have you guys ever heard
of alcohol poisoning?

19:19.442 --> 19:21.643
Yeah, it kills about 400 people
every year. Uh...

19:22.612 --> 19:23.845
(crying)

19:23.913 --> 19:25.280
Santana, are you...
are you crying?

19:25.348 --> 19:26.982
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:27.049 --> 19:28.216
QUINN:
You're such
a hypocrite.

19:28.284 --> 19:30.151
You drink. Most adults do.

19:30.219 --> 19:32.153
Well, I may have a beer
every now and then,

19:32.221 --> 19:33.521
but I don't...
I don't get drunk.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.956
We're just saying
this is a waste of time.

19:35.024 --> 19:36.524
I mean, we're totally
aware of alcohol.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.026
We see adults
drinking it and having fun.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.127
Every commercial
during NASCAR

19:39.195 --> 19:39.995
is for beer.

19:40.062 --> 19:42.263
Okay. Enough, guys.

19:42.331 --> 19:44.332
Look, tomorrow come
with your thinking caps on,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.368
because we're going
to spend the entire day

19:46.435 --> 19:48.336
brainstorming ideas for songs

19:48.404 --> 19:49.738
to sing at
this assembly.

19:49.805 --> 19:51.873
(sighs, school bell rings)

19:51.941 --> 19:53.274
Am I out of touch?

19:53.342 --> 19:55.677
I mean, I used to drink
a lot more when I was their age.

19:55.745 --> 19:58.179
Most of the time it was just
to deal with Terri, but I mean,

19:58.247 --> 19:59.748
who am I to tell them
not to drink

19:59.815 --> 20:01.149
when I blacked out
a couple of times

20:01.217 --> 20:02.917
when I was their age,
and I ended up okay?

20:02.985 --> 20:04.953
You're taking
this way too hard.

20:05.021 --> 20:06.054
Something else
going on?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.455
Let's see.

20:07.523 --> 20:09.991
Um... my divorce is starting
to really sink in.

20:10.059 --> 20:12.327
Sue's coaching my competition
at Regionals.

20:12.395 --> 20:15.263
And Emma is looking for a house
with her husband.

20:15.331 --> 20:16.665
Is that all?

20:16.732 --> 20:18.333
What do you do

20:18.401 --> 20:20.235
for stress
relief?
Exercise.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.238
Well, me, too, but that's
a little too close to
being productive.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.640
You got to get a little
ridiculous, man, burn off

20:25.708 --> 20:27.242
some of that angst.
You have
any suggestions?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.743
Tomorrow night,

20:28.811 --> 20:30.645
you're tagging along with me
for my stress relief.

20:30.713 --> 20:32.047
We're going to

20:32.114 --> 20:34.382
a little place
they call Rosalita's Roadhouse.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.552

21:09.512 --> 21:10.712
Hi, Rachel.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.614
Kurt and I were just
talking about you.

21:12.682 --> 21:16.551
You're such a cutie pie
with your blazer and your pants.

21:16.619 --> 21:19.521
So...

21:19.589 --> 21:21.756
I have a question for you.

21:21.824 --> 21:23.558
I wanted to know...

21:23.626 --> 21:24.826
Oh, my God.
Is she drunk?

21:24.894 --> 21:26.294
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:26.362 --> 21:29.097
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.

21:29.165 --> 21:30.999
All right, I'll
see you then.

21:31.067 --> 21:33.235
Okay, bye.

21:35.037 --> 21:37.339
Rachel just asked me out.

21:37.406 --> 21:38.640
Oh, that's amazing.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.508
She's got a girl crush on you.

21:40.576 --> 21:42.878
(Kurt laughs)

21:42.945 --> 21:45.013
Wait a second.
Why'd you say yes?

21:45.081 --> 21:46.214
You can't lead her on.

21:46.282 --> 21:47.582
Who says I'm
leading her on?

21:49.352 --> 21:51.052
You can't be serious.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.022
When we kissed,
it... it felt good.

21:54.090 --> 21:56.091
It felt good
because you were drunk.

21:56.158 --> 21:58.460
What's the harm in going out
on one crummy little date?

21:58.527 --> 22:01.229
<i>You're gay, Blaine!
I... thought I was, but...</i>

22:01.297 --> 22:03.398
I've never even had
a boyfriend before.

22:03.466 --> 22:06.568
Isn't this the time you're
supposed to... figure stuff out?

22:06.636 --> 22:08.803
I can't believe that I'm
hearing this right now.
Maybe I'm bi. I don't know.

22:08.871 --> 22:11.106
Bisexual's a term that
gay guys in high school use

22:11.173 --> 22:13.508
when they want to hold hands
with girls and feel like

22:13.576 --> 22:15.343
a normal person
for a change.
Whoa, wait, wait.

22:15.411 --> 22:17.779
Why are you so angry?
Because I look up to you.

22:17.847 --> 22:19.447
I admire how proud you are

22:19.515 --> 22:21.316
of who you are.
I know what it's like

22:21.384 --> 22:23.318
to be in the closet,
and here you are

22:23.386 --> 22:26.288
about to tiptoe back in.
I'm really sorry if this
hurts your feelings

22:26.355 --> 22:28.023
or your pride or whatever,

22:28.090 --> 22:30.592
but however confusing
it might be for you,

22:30.660 --> 22:33.495
it's actually a lot more
confusing for me.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.297
You're 100% sure
who you are.

22:35.364 --> 22:37.098
Fantastic.

22:37.166 --> 22:40.068
Well... maybe we all
can't be so lucky.

22:40.136 --> 22:41.703
Yeah, I have... I've had
a lot of luck, Blaine.

22:41.771 --> 22:44.005
I was really lucky to be
chased out of high school

22:44.073 --> 22:45.573
by a bully who
threatened to kill me.

22:45.641 --> 22:47.075
And why did he do that?

22:47.143 --> 22:48.643
Because he didn't
like who I was.

22:48.711 --> 22:50.979
Sort of exactly what you're
saying to me right now.

22:51.047 --> 22:54.249
Isn't it?

22:54.317 --> 22:55.550
I am...

22:55.618 --> 22:56.551
(sighs)

22:56.619 --> 22:58.119
...I'm searching, okay?

22:58.187 --> 23:00.689
I am honestly just
trying to figure out

23:00.756 --> 23:02.190
who I am, and for you,

23:02.258 --> 23:04.759
of all people, to get
down on me for that,

23:04.827 --> 23:07.429
I didn't think
that's who you were.

23:07.496 --> 23:10.298
I'll see you.

23:10.366 --> 23:14.469
I'd say "bye," but I wouldn't
want to make you angry.

26:07.977 --> 26:09.444
Drinks on me!

26:09.512 --> 26:11.713
Thanks for helping
with the party cleanup.

26:11.780 --> 26:12.914
Especially
considering

26:12.982 --> 26:14.449
that you didn't even drink.

26:14.517 --> 26:16.217
Well, I was in
the neighborhood.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.186
At 10:00?
Are you sure you're not here

26:18.254 --> 26:20.355
just to find out how
my date with Blaine went?

26:20.422 --> 26:21.856
Oh, was that tonight?

26:21.924 --> 26:24.626
Look, we're
friends, so...

26:24.693 --> 26:26.628
I'm gonna be
honest with you.

26:26.695 --> 26:27.929
♪
♪

26:27.997 --> 26:29.931
The date was lovely.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.666
<i>We saw Love Story at
the Revival Theater.</i>

26:31.734 --> 26:34.102
We even dressed up
as the characters.

26:34.170 --> 26:35.670
That's not gay at all.

26:35.738 --> 26:37.972
Did you kiss?
No. Our lips

26:38.040 --> 26:40.175
spent the evening mouthing
Ali McGraw's dialogue.

26:40.242 --> 26:42.243
Frankly, I did expect
a little snog

26:42.311 --> 26:44.579
as the date drew
to a close, but...

26:44.647 --> 26:46.381
I guess the timing
just wasn't right.

26:46.448 --> 26:47.749
Or the blood-alcohol level.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.585
Look... I know that
you have feelings for him,

26:50.653 --> 26:53.688
and I'm sure you think
I'm crazy for asking him out,

26:53.756 --> 26:55.190
but Blaine is
obviously conflicted,

26:55.257 --> 26:56.724
and if he
turns out not

26:56.792 --> 26:59.527
to be gay, well, then I guess I
will have done you a favor.

26:59.595 --> 27:03.064
And I'm doing you a favor
by telling you that Blaine

27:03.132 --> 27:06.834
is the first of a long line
of conflicted men that

27:06.902 --> 27:08.203
you will date
that will later

27:08.270 --> 27:10.405
turn out to be only
thmost flaming of homosexuals.

27:10.472 --> 27:12.540
Blaine and I have
a lot in common.

27:12.608 --> 27:15.877
A sentiment expressed
by many a hag about many a gay.

27:15.945 --> 27:18.213
Look, I don't doubt
that you and Blaine

27:18.280 --> 27:22.150
would have a jolly good time
shopping at Burberry

27:22.218 --> 27:23.751
and arguing
who would make

27:23.819 --> 27:25.253
the better Rum Tum Tugger--

27:25.321 --> 27:27.121
I don't dispute that--

27:27.189 --> 27:29.657
but there's something you
and Blaine'll never have...

27:29.725 --> 27:31.326
and that's chemistry.

27:33.362 --> 27:35.730
Fine.

27:35.798 --> 27:37.565
Then I'm gonna
prove you wrong.

27:37.633 --> 27:39.067
I'm gonna take

27:39.134 --> 27:41.202
the beer goggles off, and
I'm gonna kiss him sober.

27:41.270 --> 27:44.272
And if the spark is still
there, then I'm taking you

27:44.340 --> 27:47.976
to your bakery of choice for a
piping hot slice of humble pie.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.396
(Beiste laughs)

27:54.464 --> 27:56.765
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
easy, partner.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.901
(slurring): Can I get
you something to drink?

27:58.969 --> 28:00.703
Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:00.770 --> 28:02.738
Taxi's waiting.
All right.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.007
(exhales)
H-H-How are you not drunk?

28:05.075 --> 28:06.876
We drank exactly
the same amount.

28:06.943 --> 28:08.644
I got a hollow leg.

28:08.712 --> 28:10.579
(laughs)
You got a hollow leg!

28:10.647 --> 28:12.348
You gonna be okay?

28:12.415 --> 28:13.916
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

28:13.984 --> 28:17.052
(grunts) I just... just
got to grade some papers

28:17.120 --> 28:18.587
and... I'm still looking

28:18.655 --> 28:20.923
for a song for the kids to sing

28:20.991 --> 28:23.659
at the Alcohol
Awareness Assembly.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.027
Oh...
Yes, uh...

28:25.095 --> 28:27.630
The kids
want to sing a Ke$ha song...

28:27.697 --> 28:31.867
but, uh, it just makes drinking
seem like a lot of fun.

28:31.935 --> 28:33.602
<i>Sometimes it is fun.</i>

28:33.670 --> 28:35.671
Exactly.
(chuckles)

28:35.739 --> 28:37.139
Like tonight.

28:37.207 --> 28:39.808
That's the most fun I've had
in a really long time.

28:39.876 --> 28:41.777
I mean, we were careful.
Mm-hmm.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.445
We didn't drive.
Mm, yeah.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.647
What's wrong with that?

28:44.714 --> 28:45.681
Nothin'.

28:45.749 --> 28:47.316
Nothin's wrong with that.

28:47.384 --> 28:49.385
Except we're not
teenagers anymore, Will.

28:51.087 --> 28:52.354
You know?

28:52.422 --> 28:54.089
The way I see it,

28:54.157 --> 28:55.624
you can't just
lecture kids.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.860
I mean, we can't stop
them from drinking

28:57.928 --> 28:59.795
if that's what
they're gonna do.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.597
I mean, the best
we can do

29:01.665 --> 29:04.033
is make them aware of
the dangers and just...

29:04.100 --> 29:05.234
hope they're
smart enough

29:05.302 --> 29:08.604
to make a good
decision on their own.

29:08.672 --> 29:10.539
(laughing)

29:12.208 --> 29:14.376
Nut. All right, buddy,
I'm out of here.

29:14.444 --> 29:15.811
Okay.
Don't get up.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.246
(grunts)
I'm not...
(slurred muttering)

29:17.314 --> 29:19.248
All right, hey.
Yes?

29:19.316 --> 29:21.650
You just make sure you
drink lots of water.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.185
Okay?
Mwa!

29:23.253 --> 29:24.954
I love you.

29:25.021 --> 29:26.622
Right back at you.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.357
Yay, happy face.

29:28.425 --> 29:30.259
Okay.

29:30.327 --> 29:31.961
(belches)

29:32.028 --> 29:34.430
That was a valiant effort.

29:34.497 --> 29:36.098
You get a A-plus.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.066
That's how I roll.

29:37.133 --> 29:40.102
I don't even know who you are.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.542
Oh, what the hell?

29:49.045 --> 29:51.847
Hey, there...

29:51.915 --> 29:53.782
sexy lady. (chuckles)

29:53.850 --> 29:56.185
I know it's late.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.288
And... I know you're taken,

29:59.356 --> 30:01.457
and I've had
a couple drinks, but...

30:03.393 --> 30:07.663
<i>...there's something I r-really,
really want to say to you.</i>

30:07.731 --> 30:09.565
(school bell rings)

30:11.067 --> 30:12.568
William!

30:12.635 --> 30:14.903
Can't wait to see what your
New Directions are planning

30:14.971 --> 30:16.939
for the assembly.
I know we've had issues

30:17.007 --> 30:19.274
with your kids performing
in front of the school,

30:19.342 --> 30:21.877
but I have a really good feeling
about this one.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.312
(whispers):
Why are you screaming?

30:23.380 --> 30:24.947
I'm not screaming.
Are you okay?

30:25.015 --> 30:27.716
Oh... wow, your cologne
is just really strong.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.019
It's Drakar Noir!

30:30.086 --> 30:31.620
Emma.
(laughs)
Ooh...

30:31.688 --> 30:33.822
Will, you look terrible.

30:33.890 --> 30:35.624
Considering how
much I drank,

30:35.692 --> 30:37.292
I think I'm lucky
to be alive.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.161
(laughs)
Although I kind of
wish I was dead.

30:39.229 --> 30:41.196
I am so embarrassed.

30:41.264 --> 30:43.665
Why? I mean, besides
the fact that you drank

30:43.733 --> 30:46.335
like a frat boy
and you're well
into your 30's.

30:46.403 --> 30:48.904
Please don't
make me say it.
Sorry?

30:48.972 --> 30:51.940
I don't even remember
half the things I said to you.
I-I'm not following.

30:52.008 --> 30:53.642
I-I drunk-dialed you last night.

30:53.710 --> 30:55.277
No, you didn't.

30:55.345 --> 30:57.246
I mean, I didn't get
a single message.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.848
What would you have said that
you'd be embarrassed about?

30:59.916 --> 31:00.983
Nothing.

31:01.051 --> 31:02.785
(school bell rings)
(both laughing)

31:02.852 --> 31:04.286
I-I-I... This
must have been

31:04.354 --> 31:06.755
a really elaborate, uh,
booze dream, yeah.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.590
SUE:
It's time, Will.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.626
I've arranged to have you
committed for 48 hours,

31:10.693 --> 31:12.061
and it's not
gonna be easy.

31:12.128 --> 31:14.797
Those state institutions
tend to turn the fire hose

31:14.864 --> 31:16.565
on patients going
through the D.T.'s,

31:16.633 --> 31:18.500
but at this point,
I have no other option

31:18.568 --> 31:19.601
but a forced intervention.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.604
Sue, I do not have
a drinking problem.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.506
Really? Then what's with
the Corey Hart imitation?

31:24.574 --> 31:25.541
(sighs)

31:25.608 --> 31:27.709
Will, I'm trying to save you.

31:27.777 --> 31:30.312
Why? All you ever want
to do is destroy me.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.182
Yeah, well, it's kind of like
nursing a P.O.W. back to health

31:33.249 --> 31:35.384
so he's at his strongest
when you torture him to death.

31:35.452 --> 31:36.985
(groans)

31:37.053 --> 31:38.487
All right, Will,
you had your chance

31:38.555 --> 31:39.988
to do this the easy way.

31:40.056 --> 31:41.790
KURT: Souffle is all
about the whites.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.726
If you get yolk in it
or you don't let it
stiffen properly

31:44.794 --> 31:46.628
then you might as well
be making pancakes.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.465
All right. You think the one
we already made is ready yet?

31:49.532 --> 31:50.699
I hope so.

31:50.767 --> 31:52.734
All right, let's check it out.

31:52.802 --> 31:54.536
Here we go.

31:54.604 --> 31:56.238
Ta-da.
(sighs)

31:56.306 --> 31:58.440
You didn't leave
enough room in the
dish to let it rise.

31:58.508 --> 32:00.776
Hey, I'm sorry-- why are
you being so hard on me?

32:00.844 --> 32:03.512
I would've been happy
with you teaching me
to make toast.

32:03.580 --> 32:06.448
I'm sorry, Dad, I know
this is supposed to be
bonding time, but...

32:06.516 --> 32:07.916
it's Blaine.

32:07.984 --> 32:10.552
He's interested...
in Rachel.

32:12.021 --> 32:14.022
I'm confused;
I thought he was gay, too.

32:14.090 --> 32:15.424
Oh, he is, he is.

32:15.492 --> 32:18.660
He's just...
experimenting.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.230
(laughs)
Yeah. He's not the only one.

32:21.297 --> 32:22.698
What does that mean?

32:22.765 --> 32:24.600
Look, I need you to ask me

32:24.667 --> 32:26.435
before you have
someone sleep over.

32:26.503 --> 32:28.137
We-we were fullylothed
the entire time,

32:28.204 --> 32:31.240
and Blaine was too drunk to
drive, so I let him crash here.

32:31.307 --> 32:32.441
I was being responsible.

32:32.509 --> 32:33.842
Wait a minute,
you kids are drinking now?

32:33.910 --> 32:35.644
Finn and I didn't have any.

32:35.712 --> 32:37.346
If that's what
you're worried about.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.647
No. I'm worried

32:38.715 --> 32:41.950
about you being
inappropriate
in my house.

32:42.018 --> 32:44.853
And if Puckerman had
a sleepover with Finn,

32:44.921 --> 32:46.722
would that be inappropriate?

32:46.789 --> 32:48.690
That's different.
Because they
wouldn't have sex?

32:48.758 --> 32:53.128
No, I would never allow Finn
to have a girl sleep over

32:53.196 --> 32:54.763
in his bed.

32:54.831 --> 32:56.732
But would it make you
uncomfortable if he did?

32:56.799 --> 32:58.700
Hey, when have
I been uncomfortable

32:58.768 --> 33:00.969
<i>with you being gay?
So it's not being gay
that upsets you,</i>

33:01.037 --> 33:02.337
it's just me acting on it.

33:02.405 --> 33:05.140
I don't know what two guys do
when they're together.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.876
<i>You know, I sat through
that whole Brokeback Mountain.</i>

33:07.944 --> 33:09.444
From what I gather,

33:09.512 --> 33:11.246
something went down
in the tent.

33:11.314 --> 33:12.781
Okay. What do you want
from me here, Dad? I...

33:12.849 --> 33:15.717
I want you to apologize
for being inappropriate

33:15.785 --> 33:18.387
and promise me
you'll never do it again.

33:19.556 --> 33:23.058
Fine. I'm sorry.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.994
I won't have sleepovers with
anyone that might be gay

33:26.062 --> 33:27.996
without asking you first.

33:28.064 --> 33:30.732
Thank you.

33:35.972 --> 33:39.241
But maybe you could step
outside your comfort zone

33:39.309 --> 33:41.543
and educate yourself, so
if I have any questions,

33:41.611 --> 33:44.646
I could go to my dad, like
any straight son could.

33:50.323 --> 33:52.424
. Quiet,
please, children.

33:52.492 --> 33:54.960
I would like
to wish you and yours

33:55.028 --> 33:58.030
a healthy and happy
Alcohol Awareness Week.

33:58.098 --> 33:59.565
Unfortunately,

33:59.632 --> 34:02.434
Kitty Dukakis could not be here
because of disinterest,

34:02.502 --> 34:06.372
but Lima Police Chief
Lawrence Krowley is here

34:06.439 --> 34:09.808
to show you a grisly slideshow
of auto accidents.

34:09.876 --> 34:11.342
Take it away, Chief.

34:11.411 --> 34:12.844
BRITTANY: You guys, I'm
really nervous.

34:12.911 --> 34:15.614
Ke$ha's been
a cultural icon for weeks,

34:15.681 --> 34:17.815
and I really want
to do her music justice.

34:17.884 --> 34:20.152
We haven't had enough rehearsal.
Or any at all.

34:20.219 --> 34:21.587
And most of our
assembly performances

34:21.654 --> 34:22.554
usually end
in some kind of riot.

34:22.621 --> 34:23.889
Never fear, teammates.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.690
Now, it's a Broadway tradition
for nervous performers

34:25.759 --> 34:27.192
to take a shot of whiskey
before going on

34:27.260 --> 34:28.393
to calm their nerves

34:28.460 --> 34:29.995
and to mask the stench
of bad dental hygiene.

34:30.063 --> 34:32.331
In that tradition, I have mixed
us a playful showbiz cocktail

34:32.399 --> 34:35.000
of what was left in
my dads' liquor cabinet.

34:35.068 --> 34:36.768
There's some brandy
and vermouth and port wine

34:36.835 --> 34:38.303
and scotch in here, and also
a little bit of Kool-Aid

34:38.371 --> 34:39.538
and some crumbled-up Oreos.

34:39.606 --> 34:40.606
SANTANA:
Oh, my God.

34:40.672 --> 34:41.672
This tastes like
cough syrup.

34:41.741 --> 34:42.775
There's also cough syrup.

34:42.842 --> 34:43.742
ALL: Cheers.
To Ke$ha.

34:43.810 --> 34:44.842
Cheers. Ke$ha.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.210
To Ke$ha.
To Ke$ha.

34:46.279 --> 34:47.713
Thank you, Chief.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.915

37:08.888 --> 37:10.422
Everybody, drink responsibly.

37:16.062 --> 37:17.496
Heads up, McKinley.

37:17.564 --> 37:20.699
Coach Sylvester's
gonna shout at ya.

37:20.767 --> 37:23.068
Students,

37:23.136 --> 37:25.704
colleagues, indeed,

37:25.772 --> 37:28.974
all who understand
the Queen's English...

37:29.042 --> 37:32.744
we all still quake in terror
at what we witnessed yesterday

37:32.812 --> 37:35.147
at the assembly by a Glee Club

37:35.214 --> 37:37.749
spiraling out of control.

37:37.817 --> 37:39.785
My nose is still filled

37:39.852 --> 37:42.688
with the acrid stench
of teen vomit.

37:42.755 --> 37:45.557
And there is, simply,
but one person to blame.

37:45.625 --> 37:49.127
The alcoholic teen-vomit
fetishist Will Schuester,

37:49.195 --> 37:52.264
the director of that club.

37:52.332 --> 37:54.333
Two days ago,

37:54.400 --> 37:55.901
I received a drunk dial

37:55.969 --> 37:57.869
in the middle of the night
from a horny Will Schuester.

37:57.937 --> 37:59.037
Oh, no.

37:59.105 --> 38:00.806
Open your ears, McKinley High,

38:00.873 --> 38:02.941
and behold the awful price

38:03.009 --> 38:05.043
of alcoholism.

38:05.111 --> 38:06.478
(phone beeps)

38:06.546 --> 38:09.514
WILL (on phone):
Hey there, sexy lady.

38:09.582 --> 38:11.083
(laughs)

38:11.150 --> 38:14.152
There's something I really,
really want to say to you.

38:14.220 --> 38:16.054
I love how you eat your lunch

38:16.122 --> 38:18.557
with your little plastic gloves,
and they crinkle

38:18.625 --> 38:21.393
and make the cutest sound I've
ever heard in my life.

38:21.461 --> 38:25.263
Why don't you pick up
some wine coolers,

38:25.331 --> 38:27.366
and come over here?

38:27.433 --> 38:29.201
And it'll be just one night
of us just getting crazy.

38:29.235 --> 38:31.236
Let's just get crazy!

38:31.304 --> 38:34.673
Let's get really crazy
and roll around in the hay.

38:34.741 --> 38:35.907
(laughing)

38:35.975 --> 38:38.010
I was just in some hay
earlier tonight,

38:38.077 --> 38:40.412
and I rode a bull
and I was thinking of you.

38:44.350 --> 38:47.219
(phone beeps off)
Will Schuester?

38:47.286 --> 38:49.588
You've just been
publicly humiliated.

38:49.656 --> 38:51.690
And on the road to recovery,

38:51.758 --> 38:54.559
it's the very first step.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here

39:05.753 --> 39:06.819
I think you'll
definitely get suspended.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.354
You'll probably all
get suspended.

39:08.422 --> 39:11.491
Oh, you're one to talk. How
about you crack a Four Loko,

39:11.558 --> 39:12.525
Count Boozy Von Drunk-a-ton.

39:16.163 --> 39:18.064
William? Glee Club?

39:18.132 --> 39:20.266
I have one word for you.

39:21.602 --> 39:23.069
Congratulations.

39:23.137 --> 39:26.839
Those special effects at
the assembly really paid off!

39:26.907 --> 39:28.875
I had no idea what brilliant

39:28.942 --> 39:32.378
musical comedy performers
you all have become.

39:32.446 --> 39:33.713
The kids at this school

39:33.781 --> 39:34.714
are scared straight.

39:34.782 --> 39:35.782
Today is the first day

39:35.849 --> 39:37.650
in a month without a single act

39:37.718 --> 39:39.452
of public drunkenness

39:39.520 --> 39:42.121
at McKinley High!

39:42.189 --> 39:44.624
And as a thank
you, here are

39:44.691 --> 39:46.692
coupons
for half-off frozen yogurt.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.394
Yum.

39:48.462 --> 39:49.796
(all chuckling)

39:49.863 --> 39:52.498
William, I do think
you need to see someone

39:52.566 --> 39:54.934
about your sex
and love addiction.

39:55.002 --> 39:57.537
I've talked
to my pastor about you,

39:57.604 --> 40:00.706
and he's willing to meet you
at your earliest convenience.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.074
Thank you.

40:02.142 --> 40:03.309
Okay.

40:03.377 --> 40:04.377
Achievement!

40:04.444 --> 40:07.446
(half-hearted cheering)

40:07.514 --> 40:10.883
I'm torn. Part of me never wants
to drink again because it made

40:10.951 --> 40:13.820
me so sick, but if it weren't
for drinking, the assembly would

40:13.887 --> 40:16.022
have been a disaster.
I, for one, am never
drinking again.

40:16.089 --> 40:18.391
Being thrown up on, it just
does something to a person.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.993
All right, guys, while I'm happy
things worked out

40:21.061 --> 40:22.862
with the assembly,

40:22.930 --> 40:25.431
I never want to see you guys
pull anything like that again.

40:25.499 --> 40:27.934
Drinking while performing
is unprofessional.

40:28.001 --> 40:29.335
Drinking while at school
is just stupid,

40:29.403 --> 40:31.003
and, most importantly,

40:31.071 --> 40:32.839
any of you guys
drinking at all is illegal.

40:32.906 --> 40:34.106
There's a fair
amount of the pot

40:34.174 --> 40:35.308
calling the kettle
black right now.

40:35.375 --> 40:37.143
(whispers):
That is so racist.

40:37.211 --> 40:38.411
WILL:
I couldn't agree more.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.413
Which is why I'm going
to stop drinking.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.415
Not even a beer at the end of
the night to take the edge off.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.317
But if you don't drink,

40:44.384 --> 40:45.551
what will you have
to live for?

40:45.619 --> 40:48.120
I have plenty
in my life without beer.

40:48.188 --> 40:49.455
Like what, exactly?

40:49.523 --> 40:52.158
The point is, I'm going to stop.

40:52.226 --> 40:53.492
And I hope you guys do, too.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.428
Isn't that kind
of unrealistic?

40:55.495 --> 40:57.463
Yeah. Honestly,
I think it is.

40:57.531 --> 40:59.298
Which is why I'm only
going to ask you to do it

40:59.366 --> 41:01.400
until after Nationals.

41:01.468 --> 41:03.402
Consider yourselves
like prize fighters

41:03.470 --> 41:06.405
getting ready for a
big heavyweight bout.

41:06.473 --> 41:09.208
Now, these are
pledge forms.

41:09.276 --> 41:10.910
And I want you guys

41:10.978 --> 41:12.178
to sign them.

41:12.246 --> 41:13.379
And what if we fall
off the wagon again?

41:13.447 --> 41:16.649
Look in the top corner
of your form.

41:16.717 --> 41:18.484
That's my cell phone number.
Yes!

41:18.552 --> 41:21.587
Part of your pledge
is that if you do slip up,

41:21.655 --> 41:24.457
no matter where you are,
or what time of the night it is,

41:24.524 --> 41:25.892
I want you to call me
to drive you home.

41:27.494 --> 41:29.262
We got lucky this time
that the only consequences

41:29.329 --> 41:31.564
of your drinking
was some ill-timed vomiting.

41:31.632 --> 41:34.734
None of us wants to see any
of you guys get hurt.

41:34.801 --> 41:36.035
Cool beans, Mr. Shue.
I'll sign this.

41:36.103 --> 41:38.938
Me, too. I mean,
alcohol has done nothing

41:39.006 --> 41:40.439
for my songwriting.

41:40.507 --> 41:43.509
What about
after we win Nationals?

41:48.015 --> 41:51.150
I'm buying the sparkling cider.

41:51.218 --> 41:52.919
(all chuckling)
SAM:
Yes.

41:52.986 --> 41:54.287
So, you said he comes
this way at 3:30?

41:54.354 --> 41:56.555
Like clockwork. For his
post-rehearsal medium drip.

41:56.623 --> 41:58.057
I just can't wait
to lay one on him.

41:58.125 --> 42:00.259
I've got a bad feeling
about this, Rachel.

42:00.327 --> 42:01.694
I mean, I don't mean
to be schooled,

42:01.762 --> 42:03.429
but I don't want you
to get hurt, either.

42:03.497 --> 42:05.131
There's no victory in this
for me, either way.

42:05.198 --> 42:06.399
Who cares about you, buddy?

42:06.466 --> 42:07.767
I might get a new
boyfriend out of this,

42:07.834 --> 42:09.635
who can keep up with me
vocally, and in the future,

42:09.703 --> 42:10.903
give me vaguely Eurasian-
looking children.

42:10.971 --> 42:12.538
KURT:
There he is.

42:12.606 --> 42:15.207
