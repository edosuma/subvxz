21:46.222 --> 21:49.772
Why, my darling husband, of course.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.737
When Faraday was 49...

21:53.896 --> 21:57.070
...he began to battle severe
memory loss and depression.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.235
His work came to a standstill.

21:59.401 --> 22:05.374
And although he never fully recovered,
his greatest achievements still lay ahead.

22:19.922 --> 22:24.644
Faraday had immersed himself so deeply
in electrical and magnetic experiments...

22:24.802 --> 22:27.772
...that he came to visualize
the space around a magnet...

22:27.930 --> 22:31.025
...as filled with invisible lines of force.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.863
<i>A magnet was not simply the magnetized
bar of iron that you could see.</i>

22:36.188 --> 22:40.238
<i>It was also the unseen "something"
in the space around the bar.</i>

22:41.694 --> 22:43.742
<i>And that something he called a "field."</i>

22:44.530 --> 22:47.033
<i>A magnetic field.</i>

22:47.616 --> 22:50.415
<i>Faraday believed in the unity of nature.</i>

22:50.578 --> 22:54.378
<i>Having demonstrated the connections
between electricity and magnetism...</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:57.339
<i>...he wondered, were these two forces...</i>

22:57.501 --> 23:00.801
<i>...also connected to a third: light?</i>

23:01.463 --> 23:05.843
If he could only show a connection
among these three invisible phenomena...

23:06.010 --> 23:10.311
...one of nature's most intimate secrets
would at last be revealed.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.145

23:12.308 --> 23:14.356
<i>He designed an experiment.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:17.362
<i>Faraday knew that light
can travel as a wave.</i>

23:17.521 --> 23:20.775
<i>Waves of light vibrate randomly
in all directions.</i>

23:20.941 --> 23:24.286
<i>But there's a way to isolate
a single wave of light.</i>

23:24.445 --> 23:26.948
<i>It's called polarization.</i>

23:27.114 --> 23:30.066
When light bounces off
a reflective surface,

23:30.078 --> 23:33.042
like a mirror, it
becomes polarized.

23:33.203 --> 23:37.674
Faraday wanted to see if that
single ray of light could be manipulated...

23:37.833 --> 23:39.676
...by the invisible magnetic field.

23:40.336 --> 23:45.467
<i>The eyepiece contained a crystal that acted
as a kind of picket fence for light.</i>

23:45.633 --> 23:49.683
<i>Light could only pass through it
if it was somehow moved by the magnet.</i>

23:50.346 --> 23:53.020
<i>He placed a lantern before a mirror.</i>

23:53.182 --> 23:56.527
One that he would only see
through the eyepiece if its reflection...

23:56.685 --> 23:59.029
...could pass through the picket fence.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.691
If this is hard to
understand, don't feel bad.

24:01.857 --> 24:05.657
Scientists could not explain this
phenomenon for another hundred years.

24:06.695 --> 24:11.667
<i>Faraday knew that magnetism had no effect
on light that was moving through air.</i>

24:11.825 --> 24:14.999
<i>But what about when it was moving
through other materials?</i>

24:15.162 --> 24:18.837
<i>So, what kind of material could he use
to help the magnet move the light?</i>

24:19.667 --> 24:24.514
<i>He tried hundreds of different
transparent chemicals and objects...</i>

24:25.005 --> 24:27.724
<i>...but saw nothing through the eyepiece.</i>

24:27.883 --> 24:30.853
<i>The light was not twisted by the magnet.</i>

24:31.011 --> 24:35.141
<i>He tried crystals of calcite,
sodium carbonate...</i>

24:35.307 --> 24:37.150
<i>...calcium sulfate...</i>

24:37.309 --> 24:39.778
<i>...and still, he saw nothing.</i>

24:39.937 --> 24:44.568
<i>He tried acids:
sulfuric acid, muriatic acid...</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:46.326
<i>...carbonic acid.</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:50.911

<i>...could not twist the light from his lamp
back into view.</i>

27:10.546 --> 27:11.798
By age 40...

<i>...was just something that iron did.</i>

28:33.170 --> 28:37.346

<i>...in much the same way

<i>...humans have used carrier pigeons

Liquid iron, circulating around
the solid part of the core...

31:48.448 --> 31:53.170
...as Earth rotates, acts like a wire
carrying an electric current.

31:53.328 --> 31:57.549
And as Faraday showed us,
electric currents produce magnetic fields.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.959
And that's a good thing.

31:59.126 --> 32:02.676
Our magnetic field protects us
from the onslaught of cosmic rays...

32:02.838 --> 32:05.682
...which would be very damaging
to our biosphere.

32:10.345 --> 32:14.191
...the rate of mutation in living organisms
would be much higher.

32:14.349 --> 32:19.480
Fortunately, most of this cosmic shrapnel
gets trapped in the Van Allen belts...

32:19.646 --> 32:25.494
...donut-shaped zones of charged particles
corralled by our magnetic shield.

32:32.534 --> 32:36.380

<i>...explains one of the most beautiful

32:43.670 --> 32:46.514
<i>Charged particles from the sun,
the solar wind...</i>

32:46.673 --> 32:49.051
<i>...are constantly bombarding the Earth.</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:52.812
<i>You can think of the solar wind
as a kind of electric current.</i>

32:52.971 --> 32:55.690
<i>Our planet's magnetic field
channels that current...</i>

32:55.849 --> 32:57.817
<i>...towards the north and south poles.</i>

32:57.976 --> 32:59.478
<i>When it hits our atmosphere...</i>

32:59.644 --> 33:02.147
<i>...the oxygen and nitrogen
molecules in the air...</i>

33:02.314 --> 33:05.568
<i>...glow like giant fluorescent
light bulbs.</i>

33:27.297 --> 33:31.143
When Faraday pursued his last
and most profound discovery...

33:31.301 --> 33:35.147
...the poverty of his childhood
stymied him as it never had before.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.558
He needed help and found it in one...

33:37.724 --> 33:40.568
...who had come from another world.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.962
Michael Faraday had solved the mystery
that baffled Isaac Newton.

34:17.472 --> 34:22.774
<i>This was how the sun told the planets
how to move without touching them.</i>

34:22.936 --> 34:27.612
<i>The sun does touch the planets
with its gravitational field.</i>

34:28.190 --> 34:33.539
<i>And Earth's gravitational field
tells the apples how to fall.</i>

34:40.954 --> 34:44.583
All this is a dream.

34:46.668 --> 34:50.922
Unfortunately, that was the prevailing view
among his fellow scientists:

34:51.089 --> 34:52.931
Faraday was dreaming.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.641
<i>They admired his inventiveness
and his genius for experimentation...</i>

34:56.803 --> 34:59.522
<i>...but they regarded his
invisible lines of force...</i>

34:59.681 --> 35:03.481
<i>...and his ideas about light and gravity
as hand-waving...</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:06.192
<i>...meaning there was nothing solid
to back it up.</i>

35:07.147 --> 35:09.491
<i>Some openly ridiculed his theories.</i>

35:09.983 --> 35:11.860
<i>They needed to see
his ideas expressed...</i>

35:12.027 --> 35:15.907
<i>...in the language of modern physics:
precise equations.</i>

35:16.072 --> 35:19.246
<i>This was the one area
where Faraday's childhood poverty...</i>

35:19.409 --> 35:23.710
<i>...and lack of formal education
actually held him back.</i>

35:24.205 --> 35:26.424
<i>He couldn't do the math.</i>

35:26.583 --> 35:31.339
<i>Faraday had finally hit a wall
that he could not overcome.</i>

35:31.630 --> 35:37.308
<i>And then, the greatest theoretical
physicist of the 19th century came along.</i>

35:37.469 --> 35:42.566
<i>James Clerk Maxwell was born
into a world of wealth and privilege...</i>

35:42.724 --> 35:47.230
<i>...an only child of doting
middle-aged parents.</i>

35:52.150 --> 35:56.781
<i>By his early 20s, he had made a name
for himself as a mathematician.</i>

35:56.946 --> 36:00.371
<i>While other scientists had come to think
of Faraday as old-fashioned-</i>

36:00.742 --> 36:04.417
<i>A great figure of the past
but no part of the future of physics.</i>

36:04.579 --> 36:07.753
<i>--James Clerk Maxwell knew better.</i>

36:08.291 --> 36:12.467
<i>He began by reading everything
Faraday had written on electricity.</i>

36:12.629 --> 36:16.884
<i>He became convinced
that Faraday's fields of force were real...</i>

36:17.050 --> 36:21.897
<i>...and he set out to give them
a precise mathematical formulation.</i>

37:07.225 --> 37:09.944
An equation in physics
is just a shorthand description...

37:10.103 --> 37:13.528
...of something that can be
represented in space and time.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.614
For instance, the equation
describing the arc of a pendulum...

37:17.068 --> 37:21.448
...shows that it can never swing higher
than its initial height.

37:37.881 --> 37:41.010
When Maxwell translated
Faraday's experimental observations...

37:41.176 --> 37:44.396
...on electromagnetic
fields into equations...

37:44.554 --> 37:47.148
...he discovered an asymmetry.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.318
See that bottom one?

37:50.477 --> 37:52.980
It cries out for something else.

37:53.146 --> 37:58.152
Great mathematician that he was,
Maxwell added a single term to balance it.

37:58.318 --> 38:02.994
This tweaking of the equation changed
Faraday's static field into waves...

38:03.156 --> 38:05.830
...that spread outward
at the speed of light.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.166
It wasn't long before we found a way
to turn those waves...

38:11.206 --> 38:13.254
...into couriers...

38:14.125 --> 38:16.219
...for our messages.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.760
Can you see me?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.384
Can you hear me?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.811
This is how.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.563
This technology has transformed
human civilization...

38:33.728 --> 38:38.234
...from a patchwork of cities,
towns and villages...

38:38.399 --> 38:42.279
<i>...into an intercommunicating organism.</i>

38:50.745 --> 38:53.419
<i>Linking us at light speed...</i>

39:00.004 --> 39:01.347
<i>...to each other...</i>

39:10.473 --> 39:12.726
...and to the cosmos.

39:46.009 --> 39:49.309
<i><font color="#808080">FARADAY :</font>
Nothing is too wonderful to be true...</i>

39:49.470 --> 39:53.316
<i>...if it be consistent
with the laws of nature.</i>
