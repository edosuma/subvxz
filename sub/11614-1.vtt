what do we have on the
Artemus Bradford murder, hmm?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.166
Well, we got a limo
with no license,

14:46.166 --> 14:49.625
and some scrap metal
from whatever it was
that broke into the lab.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.583
Do we at least know
what was stolen?

14:51.583 --> 14:54.500
According,
to Doctor Bradford,
a robotic foot.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.083
Robotic foot.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.667
A robotic foot?
Yeah.

14:57.667 --> 15:00.834
What kind of cyber-freak
are we dealing with?

15:04.041 --> 15:05.542
SCOLEX: Not bad, Kramer.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.875
Not bad at all.
(RELIEVED SIGH)

15:09.875 --> 15:13.875
It's got a sort of postmodern
Captain Hook
kind of feel to it.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.875
Very diabolical.
(CHUCKLES)

15:16.875 --> 15:20.959
I deserve
a dashing appellation.

15:20.959 --> 15:23.625
"Dashing Appalachian"?
What is that?
A hillbilly with a tuxedo?

15:23.625 --> 15:26.583
No, you idiot!
No!

15:26.583 --> 15:29.250
(CHUCKLES) It's a nickname

15:29.250 --> 15:34.792
One that will
send my enemies
cowering in fear.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.834
Ah.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.250
Ah, too bad
"Hook" is taken, huh?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.250
How 'bout...
"Captain Claw"?
Oh.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.333
No, no, no, no, no...
KRAMER: Or "Santa Claw."

15:49.458 --> 15:51.792
Just "Claw."
One word,

15:52.250 --> 15:54.291
like "Madonna."

15:54.291 --> 15:58.083
Well, anyhoo, Captain...
Sir... Mr. Claw,

15:58.083 --> 16:01.667
I know how much you like
to maintain an
active lifestyle,

16:01.667 --> 16:04.917
so I have managed to design

16:04.917 --> 16:07.208
a few interchangeable options.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.834
Hi, hi. (LAUGHS)
Oh, very clever, Kramer.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.875
(MOCKING)
"Very clever, Kramer."

16:11.875 --> 16:14.792
Very clever, indeed.
(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS)

16:15.667 --> 16:19.625
Well, first we have
the opera hand,

16:19.625 --> 16:22.041
for those special nights out.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.625
And I know how much
you enjoy Japanese food,

16:26.625 --> 16:29.458
so I made you a sushi hand
See there?

16:29.458 --> 16:31.583
(MIMICS EATING) Tasty.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.500
Hmm.

16:33.500 --> 16:37.166
(NERVOUSLY) Also,
I don't remember if you enjoy
the medieval fare, but...

16:37.166 --> 16:39.291
Kramer, that's enough.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.000
Sikes, bring on the foot.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.750
(SHRIEKS, SIGHS)

and I can't remember anything.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.875
You may not remember
very much right now.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.667
You suffered a pretty major
concussion in the explosion.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.542
What happened?

18:26.542 --> 18:28.583

the neuron synapse amplifier.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.333
It's a highpowered

21:19.333 --> 21:22.083
That increases the charge
in the human brain wave,

21:22.083 --> 21:24.834

a little getting used to,

It's important.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.834

22:34.000 --> 22:35.458

22:37.333 --> 22:39.000
Okay, so if you
want to operate
one of your gadgets,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
you simply say
"Go-go gadget,"
and then you name the device.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.834
Well, couldn't I say
something more official,
like...

22:46.834 --> 22:49.500
Like,
"In the name of justice."

22:49.500 --> 22:51.291
(GIGGLES)
Well, you could,
but it wouldn't work.

22:51.291 --> 22:54.250
But "Go-go gadget,"
sounds so

22:54.250 --> 22:56.458
My father designed
the program, and he...

22:56.458 --> 23:00.500
Oh! Oh, oh, oh,oh!
It's "Go-go gadget."

Good. I'm glad.

So, okay, let's say
there are two guys
trying to rob a jewelry store,

23:10.250 --> 23:12.708

to trip 'em up
