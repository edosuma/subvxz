00:11.840 --> 00:13.640
You should know why you're about to die.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.360
God has abandoned you.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.040
The God who claims to love you,

00:22.320 --> 00:23.760
who demands your praise,

00:24.640 --> 00:26.800
has given you up to be destroyed.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.120
Bad luck.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Shall we begin?

00:42.240 --> 00:44.560
Stay your hand, Demon!

00:44.560 --> 00:46.680
Despised tool of Satan,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.840
in the name of Almighty God!

00:48.840 --> 00:50.400
Avaunt!

00:51.600 --> 00:52.480
Oh...

00:55.760 --> 00:57.680
It's you. Dear me.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.080
Haven't seen you since...

01:01.160 --> 01:04.000
- the flood?
- Ah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.960
Well, sorry about this.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.680
No, of course.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.080
Oh God. Where was I?

01:14.080 --> 01:15.440
-"Avaunt".
- Yes, yes.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.280
Avaunt, foul demon!

01:19.280 --> 01:23.760
In the name of the Almighty,
I command thee, begone!

01:23.760 --> 01:24.720
No.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.640
No?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.560
No, thank you. See, I have a permit.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.600
A permit? From whom?

01:34.080 --> 01:36.160
- From God.
- Oh...

01:37.080 --> 01:38.720
You see, it's not that I mind jokes.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.640
Oh no, no, no, no, no. No, no jokes.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.960
- These goats belong to Job, right?
- Yes, Job.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.240
Who is, I might add, a particular
favorite of God, so...

01:58.440 --> 01:59.320
Shall I summarize?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.720
Satan and his diabolical ministers

02:03.600 --> 02:06.120
may destroy everything Job owns,
no questions asked.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.240
Hugs and kisses, God.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.360
No!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.000
This can't be real!

02:11.480 --> 02:14.880
Job is a... good and... righteous man.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.880
I mean, he really is an absolute poppet.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.360
Well, I am a demon. Maybe I'm lying.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
Tell you what, let's find out.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.000
Seems legit to me!

02:45.000 --> 02:48.640
So, sealed by our marks of hand and hoof.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.200
Amen!

02:50.200 --> 02:52.360
Yep, that's all fine!

02:52.360 --> 02:53.920
Good heavens.

02:54.760 --> 02:58.640
- What did he do?
- Job? Nothing.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.760
Job's the nicest man in the world.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.000
That's why he's so perfect for the bet.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.000
- The bet?
- Yep.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.480
You see, God was saying
how righteous Job was

03:09.480 --> 03:10.840
and how much Job loved God.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.000
- And Satan pointed out--
- Sorry, so Satan?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.720
Mm-hmm, that maybe that was just
'cause God's been so nice to him.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.240
Anyway, long story short,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.840
God's letting Satan destroy
everything Job has.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.720
- And then we'll see.
- Oh.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.080
- So just his worldly goods.
- Exactly.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.080
Oh, nothing important, no.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.240
Just his farm, his camels, his goat,

03:33.240 --> 03:36.760
- his oxen, his children, his geese--
- His what?

03:37.400 --> 03:41.040
His geese. You know, big cross ducks.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.840
His children?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.280
Oh!

03:47.760 --> 03:51.200
Oh, I see. Well, oh well,
that's alright then.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.320
Of course it is.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.920
Trust in God's plan, Aziraphale. Always.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.240
Of course, of course.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.440
So, once Job's trials are over,

04:00.440 --> 04:02.840
um, everything is restored to him?

04:02.840 --> 04:04.800
Even better than that.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.120
God will reward him
with twice as much as he had before.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.760
Oh, praise be.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.240
Twice the oxen, twice the goats,
twice the children.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.440
Twice the... twice the children?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.240
Yes, of course.
How many does he have now, three?

04:18.960 --> 04:22.200
- So, he'll get six!
- Uh, probably... seven.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.480
You know how God likes sevens.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.360
Right. Gosh, um...

04:27.200 --> 04:29.240
The only thing is, um...

04:29.360 --> 04:32.520
Well... Sitis is 58.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.360
I, I don't know how familiar you are

04:35.480 --> 04:39.920
with the um, the human... birth process.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.800
Pretty familiar actually,

04:41.800 --> 04:46.000
seeing as how I personally witnessed
the very first human birth.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.080
Yes, yes of course.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.040
Although perhaps Eve's birth

04:50.040 --> 04:54.600
wasn't an entirely typical um... Anyway.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.920
Um, I only meant,

04:56.040 --> 04:59.720
are we sure that Sitis wants
to give birth four more times?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.680
Seven more times.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.000
But, well, she's already got
three children, so...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.880
Yeah, but those ones will be dead.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.160
Keep up.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.520
We're not bringing the old ones back?

05:10.520 --> 05:11.920
Well of course not!

05:12.520 --> 05:14.320
But we're giving them new ones.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.360
I think they quite like the old ones.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.240
- And, and if... if we kill them.
- Aziraphale...

05:23.040 --> 05:24.520
we are the good guys.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.800
Okay? We're not killing anyone.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.880
What we are doing is
simply not stopping hell.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.040
What they do is up to them.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.880
What comes after K?

05:52.600 --> 05:53.480
Ah, you startled me.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.560
- Is that good?
- I just didn't see you coming.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.720
Right.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.840
Perhaps you could make a noise
when you move around.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.680
- Yes.
- After K is L.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.840
But look, what exactly are you doing?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.480
Oh, I thought I'd make
the books easier to find,

06:09.480 --> 06:11.600
so I thought if I put them
in alphabetical order.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.720
Alphabetical... by author?

06:16.040 --> 06:16.920
What's "author"?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.480
No, I was shelving the books

06:19.480 --> 06:22.400
by the first letter of the first sentence.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.840
But no-one would ever--
Jolly good. Good idea.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.200
Thank you, Jim. Carry on.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.320
And now I will make a noise
when I move around.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.280
Right.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.080
Not that.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.760
Or that.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.600
<i>♪ Every day
It's a getting closer ♪</i>

06:48.600 --> 06:52.200
<i>♪ Going faster than a rollercoaster ♪</i>

06:53.400 --> 06:58.520
<i>♪ A love like yours will
Surely come my way ♪</i>

06:58.520 --> 06:59.480
<i>♪ A-hey... ♪</i>

07:00.280 --> 07:01.320
What are you singing?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.960
Am I singing? Err...

07:06.200 --> 07:08.560
<i>♪ A-hey, a-hey... ♪</i>

07:08.560 --> 07:10.160
I guess I was.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.360
Perhaps I made it up.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.680
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

07:16.680 --> 07:18.720
That goes under I.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.200
You're in trouble.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.480
Obviously.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.360
Former Demon, hated by Heaven,
loathed by Hell.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.480
How will our hero cope?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.880
- Are you making fun of me?
- Would you know if I was?

07:53.120 --> 07:54.160
Mind if I come in?

07:55.600 --> 07:59.040
- Gabriel has disappeared.
- So I understand.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.800
I've spoke with Beelzebub,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.840
and we believe Aziraphale
has something to do with it.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.560
Yeah, that sounds unlikely.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.680
A miracle of enormous power
happened last night.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.400
The kind of miracle

08:11.400 --> 08:15.080
only the mightiest of archangels
could've performed.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.520
Mm?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.560
Somewhere very close
to your friend's bookshop.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.240
Are you telling me
you don't know what caused it?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.840
How'd you know I didn't do it?

08:25.160 --> 08:27.800
Help us, and we will be grateful.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.800
And otherwise,

08:31.320 --> 08:33.200
you'll be disliked by Heaven,

08:33.200 --> 08:35.760
hunted and eliminated by Hell.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.880
So you do understand I'm threatening you?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.400
Ah, Maggie!

10:25.960 --> 10:27.360
You know music.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.360
What can you tell me
about a song that goes:

10:30.360 --> 10:35.160
<i>♪ Every day
It's a getting stronger ♪</i>

10:35.160 --> 10:37.640
<i>♪ Love like that will ♪</i>

10:37.640 --> 10:40.520
<i>♪ Surely come my way ♪</i>

10:40.640 --> 10:42.960
Oh. You're crying.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.080
I'm not.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.520
Do you actually think you aren't?
Because I--

10:47.520 --> 10:51.480
Yes, I know I'm crying.
It's just a thing you say.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.720
Oh, yes. Of course.

10:55.440 --> 11:00.320
Then may I ask why you... aren't crying?

11:00.320 --> 11:03.480
Well, I'm certainly not crying over her.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.320
No, no. Naturally not.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.240
I mean, sure,

11:10.240 --> 11:14.160
it took me months to nerve myself up
to even bring her an LP

11:14.160 --> 11:16.960
and then absolutely, we got locked
in the coffee shop last night

11:16.960 --> 11:19.520
and granted I then made
a complete arse of myself,

11:19.520 --> 11:22.000
and she already has a partner!

11:22.000 --> 11:26.200
But apart from that,
I'm pretty sure I'm in love.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.760
- Ah...
- But she hates me and...

11:30.640 --> 11:32.840
- What am I gonna do?
- Um...

11:34.120 --> 11:35.920
Can I get back to you on that?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.560
I think right now
I'm a bit out of miracles.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.360
Yeah. Don't worry. I've got it.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.280
And you're quite right,

11:44.280 --> 11:46.800
it's not your job to sort out
my doomed love life.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.720
The song is called "Everyday"
by Buddy Holly and Norman Petty.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.000
It was the B-side
to the "Peggy Sue" single

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
released on the Coral label in 1957.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.680
Oh. Jolly good.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.720
- Do you have a copy?
- Mm. Too many of them.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.120
There's a pub in Edinburgh.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.320
I send them singles for the jukebox,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.600
and they send me back copies of Everyday.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.000
They say every record they play
eventually just turns into that song,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.840
which is mad,
but they're Scottish, so...

12:15.840 --> 12:17.120
Here.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.640
Oh no.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.240
- No, that's not good at all.
- What?

12:26.240 --> 12:29.400
- They're here. Can't you feel them?
- Who's here?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.120
And he's there on his own!

12:44.160 --> 12:45.520
Ah. Well, well.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.560
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Aziraphale!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.280
I think you know why we're here.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.760
- We are looking--
- Greetings! I'm Jim!

12:53.760 --> 12:56.200
It's short for James, but I don't need
to keep telling everyone that.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.280
I'm an assistant book seller.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.360
Gabriel.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.640
- Where is Gabriel?
- Gabriel?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.720
You know sometimes people call me Gabriel.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.400
- Shall we discuss this inside?
- Yes!

13:12.200 --> 13:13.520
By all means.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.760
Would you like to come in?

13:21.640 --> 13:24.120
Hooray! Let the book selling commence!

13:24.120 --> 13:27.640
Uh, Jim, leave these good people alone.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.120
They, they don't want any books.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.640
Well, that's because
they haven't tried them.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.160
Books are keen! Let me show you.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.360
Did you think we wouldn't see the plume?

13:37.320 --> 13:39.840
The... The plume? What plume?

13:39.840 --> 13:42.240
The huge plume of miraculous activity.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.840
Last night. From this shop.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.320
Nearly 25 Lazarii.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.200
Don't tell me you did it?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.600
I, I suppose I, um...

13:53.280 --> 13:55.920
I might have done a miracle.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.120
And what was this miracle for, Aziraphale?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.360
Something that powerful
must have been important.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.360
These little bendy ones make a neato fan!

14:03.360 --> 14:04.720
It was, um...

14:05.800 --> 14:09.920
Err... Um, love! Yes!

14:09.920 --> 14:12.440
Yes, um, you see, uh...

14:12.440 --> 14:16.360
Maggie, who err, who owns the record shop

14:17.000 --> 14:18.520
is in love.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.600
It, it's what humans do.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.640
Uh, with Nina, over the road.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.200
And, and Ni-Nina doesn't love her back.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.520
And, um, well, Maggie's my tenant,

14:30.520 --> 14:35.840
so I, um... I did a big, big miracle...

14:35.840 --> 14:41.720
uh, to make it so
that she and Nina, err...

14:41.720 --> 14:43.320
fell in love.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.440
- And did it work?
- Oh... Yes! Yes.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.480
It, it worked brilliantly, yes.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.280
Head over heels in love.

14:50.280 --> 14:55.400
So the miracle was nothing to do
with Gabriel's disappearance then?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.720
Gabriel?

14:59.880 --> 15:04.000
Oh, you mentioned
you're looking for Gabriel.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.720
- Did we?
- Yes.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.840
Mm!

15:08.840 --> 15:11.320
And see, the big ones
can be used as fly swats.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.360
I know what you're thinking,
but it's okay,

15:13.360 --> 15:16.200
because the beauty part is,
it never works.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.360
Don't I...

15:23.320 --> 15:24.800
Don't I know you?

15:25.440 --> 15:26.400
Yes.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
You do.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.080
I'm the assistant bookseller.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.520
I opened the door for you.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I'll send someone tomorrow morning
to log and verify the miracle.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.480
We'll be keeping a very close eye
on you, Aziraphale.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.000
That's very, very professional of you.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.640
What... what about me?

15:51.640 --> 15:54.520
Uh, guys, shouldn't you keep
a close eye on me too?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.160
They seemed nice.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.240
<i>♪ Everyday it's gettin' closer ♪</i>

16:08.240 --> 16:11.600
<i>♪ Goin' faster than a roller coaster ♪</i>

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
<i>♪ Love like yours will ♪</i>

16:13.600 --> 16:16.480
<i>♪ Surely come my way ♪</i>

16:16.480 --> 16:18.640
<i>♪ A-hey, a-he-hey ♪</i>

16:18.640 --> 16:22.520
<i>♪ Everyday, it's a gettin' faster ♪</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:26.120
<i>♪ Everyone says: go ahead and ask her ♪</i>

16:26.120 --> 16:28.240
<i>♪ Love like yours will... ♪</i>

16:34.760 --> 16:37.000
Oh, we're going to the pub!

16:37.560 --> 16:40.440
- You never go to the pub!
- We're in the pub now.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.760
- What's wrong with the coffee shop?
- Well, that is precisely the point.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.320
Sherry for me please, a large one.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.280
Ah...

16:52.280 --> 16:55.480
Large Talisker, please.
And a sherry for Lady Brackney.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.680
Mr. Fell!

16:58.360 --> 16:59.920
Oh... Hello?

17:00.360 --> 17:03.040
Brown, from Brown's World of Carpets.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.200
We met at the Whickber Street Traders
and Shopkeepers Association

17:06.200 --> 17:07.840
annual meeting several years ago.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.600
- Of course.
- You said back then

17:09.720 --> 17:12.320
that you'd be delighted to host
one of our monthly get-togethers.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.000
I did?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.800
Every time I would look into your shop,
you'd be closed!

17:17.400 --> 17:20.040
If I was a superstitious man,
I would have taken it personally!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.080
- Indeed.
- Yes.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.640
So, we all need to talk
about the council's proposed

17:23.640 --> 17:26.160
rubbish collection times
and the Winter Street Lights campaign.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.040
- Oh, I, I'm afraid that--
- A sherry for you.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.880
Whisky for me... Hello.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.960
Oh, Mr. Fell has just been telling me
how much he's looking forward

17:33.960 --> 17:36.280
to hosting our monthly
street association get-together.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.200
- Ooh, you astonish me.
- So, look, I'll send over all the details,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.800
but Thursday night after closing.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.080
See? This is why I don't go to the pub.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.920
It was your idea!

17:48.920 --> 17:51.080
There's something urgent
I need to talk to you about.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.240
Yes, same here. Last night's miracle.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.080
Right. And we can't talk
about it in the café.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.440
- Because?
- It's about the woman in the café!

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
Her name's Nina.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.200
Maggie in the record shop has a...

18:02.080 --> 18:04.040
pash on her...

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
and doesn't know
how to conduct a courtship.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.560
We've got a real problem
and it's in your bookshop right now!

18:09.560 --> 18:11.160
Same problem.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.040
Our Gabriel miracle last night
set off alarms in Heaven.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.960
- Ahh!
- They suspect something!

18:16.960 --> 18:20.280
And so, I told them I'd made Nina
and Maggie fall in love.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.040
Why?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.880
- It was the first thing I could think of.
- And they believed you?

18:24.880 --> 18:26.920
They're sending someone to check.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.160
Great. Do a little miracle,
wiggle your fingers about,

18:29.160 --> 18:31.080
Nina falls for Maggie, problem solved.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.560
Ah, miracles don't work like that.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.320
So, what are you proposing?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.520
We... fix it.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.800
Nina and Maggie fall in love.
Heaven's suspicions are allayed.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.720
You mean like a sudden rainstorm

18:47.440 --> 18:49.720
forces them together beneath a canopy?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.080
They look into each other's eyes...

18:52.640 --> 18:54.280
And realize they were made for each other?

18:55.520 --> 18:59.080
- Sounds a bit unlikely.
- No, no, no. No. No.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.320
Get humans wet
and staring into each other's eyes,

19:02.320 --> 19:04.200
vavoom, sorted.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.800
I saw it in a Richard Curtis film.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.080
If you're going to invoke fiction,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.440
- you might as well do it properly.
- Properly?

19:14.640 --> 19:17.200
- You remember Jane Austen?
- Yeah.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.080
I'm not gonna forget her in a hurry, am I?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.560
The brains behind the 1810
Clerkenwell Diamond Robbery.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.200
Brandy smuggler. Master spy.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.200
What a piece of work.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.400
She wrote books. Novels.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.200
- Jane? Austen?
- Yes!

19:33.880 --> 19:35.800
Whoa, bit of a dark horse. Novels, eh?

19:35.920 --> 19:37.800
Yes. They were very good.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.560
Well. No, I'm just surprised, that's all.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.920
You think you know someone.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.080
- She had balls.
- Well.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.000
Cotillion balls.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.280
People would gather
and do some formal dancing

19:50.280 --> 19:53.000
and then realize they had
misunderstood each other

19:53.000 --> 19:55.160
and were actually deeply in love.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.880
- Now that sounds unlikely.
- Works every time apparently.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.400
And there's something else,
I'll show you the record.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.480
I think it may be... a Clue.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.560
I'm lost. Am I doing a rainstorm?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.640
Come on! I want to show you the Clue!

20:13.280 --> 20:15.440
Whatever you've found out,
don't call it a "Clue".

20:15.440 --> 20:16.560
But it is a Clue.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.320
Well, at least don't pronounce
the capital letter.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.280
Gabriel was singing this morning, a song.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.440
Wha... what?

20:21.440 --> 20:23.800
Have you ever heard a song that goes,

20:23.800 --> 20:25.800
<i>♪ Every day,
it's a getting closer? ♪</i>

20:25.800 --> 20:27.800
- No.
- Well, that's what he was singing.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.080
A human song.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.240
And there is an actual mystery
associated with that song.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.560
And that is the Clue! Yeah.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.000
Not another word.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.320
Jane Austen. Wrote books too.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.480
You people, I will never get
the hang of you lot.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.920
Ah, Jim. Now, tell me. What do you know?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.640
Okay.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.560
"Whaddayaknow."

20:59.560 --> 21:02.000
No, I mean, what's the first thing
you remember?

21:03.160 --> 21:06.520
I remember a song I sang this morning.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.320
But where did you hear it?

21:08.440 --> 21:11.440
I heard it this morning.
It came out of my mouth.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.000
Oh, and I remember those three nice people
that were in the shop just now.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.080
You do?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.640
Yes. They were in the shop, just now.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.880
Ah, you can do better than that.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.960
Come on, think!

21:23.960 --> 21:28.160
Think hard!
What is the very first thing you remember?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.400
I remember when the morning
stars sang together,

21:37.400 --> 21:40.280
and all the Angels of God shouted for joy.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.640
Yes! Oh yes, yes! That's right!

21:43.640 --> 21:44.880
- No...
- Keep going!

21:44.880 --> 21:46.320
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.800
I can't! I can't!

21:47.800 --> 21:49.440
I can't remember those things.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.080
My, my head isn't big enough. Not anymore.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.320
Yes, I, I see. Um...

21:54.320 --> 21:56.160
I'm sorry Jim.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.440
But you've done awfully well.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.120
Have a rest now.

22:12.440 --> 22:17.120
Your boss said that to Job,
do you remember?

22:17.720 --> 22:19.200
I most certainly do.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.280
- My children?
- Mmm.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.440
Are they around?
Only I need them for a... thing.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.520
I'm not sure.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.320
Sitis will know.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.560
Sorry, you've... you've come
at rather a bad time.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.720
Well, yeah, yeah, so I can see.
What happened?

22:55.720 --> 22:59.640
God has forsaken me
and delivered me to demons.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.800
Oh! You must be furious?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.280
I burn with fury.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.680
Course you do.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.720
After all your devotion to God.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.440
Not at God!

23:09.440 --> 23:11.280
Fury at myself.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.280
Yourself? Why, what have you done?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.360
I don't know.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.800
And how sunk in sin must I be
not only to deserve all this,

23:18.800 --> 23:20.360
but not even to know why.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.120
What is it now?

23:22.120 --> 23:24.000
Ah, Sitis my dear.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.800
This... person was
looking for the children.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.480
Why? Who are you?

23:29.480 --> 23:32.400
Just an old friend.
Here to offer some comfort.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.080
What 'old friend'?

23:34.640 --> 23:35.800
You tell me.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.720
Oh... Bildad the Shuhite?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.280
Sure. So, the kids.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.560
Where are they?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.200
Oh. Not now Bildad the Shuhite.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.000
Good of you to look in,
but we're a tiny bit busy

23:50.000 --> 23:51.120
weathering the wrath of God.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
Well, yeah.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.760
I thought you could do with someone
to check up on the kids.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.440
No.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.560
God wouldn't!

23:59.680 --> 24:00.640
Are you sure?

24:01.760 --> 24:04.160
But they've done nothing!
They're innocent!

24:04.160 --> 24:05.880
So were the goats.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.880
Mmmm. Nice gaff.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.600
Shame...

24:27.160 --> 24:28.000
Crowley!

24:28.480 --> 24:30.520
You don't have to destroy Job's children.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.920
Last time we met
you seemed pretty confident

24:32.920 --> 24:34.840
I couldn't destroy Job's goats.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.760
Yes. I was wrong.

24:36.760 --> 24:40.800
- Technically you can, but--
- Oh, then technically I will.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.160
But you don't have to! That's the point.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.640
Surely the great thing about being a demon

24:44.640 --> 24:46.720
is you can do whatever you want.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.480
- Mm, you sound jealous, angel.
- Certainly not.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.960
I get to do what God wants.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.960
Like killing innocent children
to win a bet with Satan?

24:54.960 --> 24:57.240
I... I don't think...

24:58.280 --> 25:01.160
- that is what God wants.
- Well...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.200
And I don't think you want it either.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.320
What do you know about what I want?

25:07.960 --> 25:10.320
- I know you.
- You do not know me

25:11.480 --> 25:13.320
I know the angel you were.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.560
The angel you knew is not me.

25:16.760 --> 25:20.040
Then... Then you tell me
that you want to do this.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.160
You look me in the eye and tell me.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.840
I want to.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.960
I long to destroy the blameless children
of blameless Job,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.680
just as I destroyed his blameless goats.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.040
Then God forgive you.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.880
Well?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.160
- You can stop grinning.
- I'm not grinning.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.000
Doesn't mean we're on the same side.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.320
No! No...

26:37.520 --> 26:39.200
Temporarily not on different sides.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.600
Just as you say.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.760
Be not afraid!

26:45.760 --> 26:50.040
I am an angel of the Lord thy God.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.520
Oh. Have you brought the wine
Daddy prayed for?

26:53.200 --> 26:56.680
- For the party?
- Err, err... No.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.480
I have no wine, child.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.600
- I bring--
- Ennon!

27:00.600 --> 27:03.200
- What is it?
- The angels are here.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.160
Just not our usual ones.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.120
And they haven't brought the wine.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.680
Well them you'd better pop off
and get it now, hadn't you?

27:17.240 --> 27:19.360
Ooh, he seems nice.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.040
I bring a warning!

27:23.040 --> 27:28.240
Satan has sent a demon to destroy you!

27:28.240 --> 27:30.280
- Tonight!
- Don't be silly.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.400
He wouldn't dare.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.320
I'm sorry, Satan?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.480
- Satan wouldn't dare?
- Certainly not.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.400
You see, I'm Keziah, daughter of Job.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.440
I'm Ennon, son of Job.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.720
And I'm Jemimah! I made this pot!

27:42.720 --> 27:43.920
- Oh.
- She did.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.960
But also: daughter of Job.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.160
You know, the Job?

27:48.160 --> 27:51.320
Literally God's favorite human.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.840
Yes, I know who you are.

27:52.840 --> 27:56.080
- You're a funny looking angel.
- Aren't I just?

27:57.680 --> 27:59.600
Are you a demon?

27:59.600 --> 28:01.680
Oh, she's good.

28:01.680 --> 28:07.200
Ah... Yes.
He is in fact technically a demon.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.320
Spot on.

28:09.040 --> 28:12.520
Sent here to destroy you all!

28:13.120 --> 28:14.200
Ready?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.840
But... you said you wouldn't.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.000
I'm a demon. I lied. Ah!

28:20.920 --> 28:22.440
Can't you save us?

28:23.400 --> 28:26.720
I'm afraid not. He has a permit, you see.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.560
But... be not afraid.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.120
You're perfectly safe.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.520
Are you sure, Angel?

28:37.200 --> 28:39.800
Yes. Quite sure.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.000
What happened? We're in the cellar.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.680
I knew it!

28:56.680 --> 28:58.080
Wind, I assume.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.640
That's what Satan really has planned.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.280
A mighty wind from the wilderness

29:03.280 --> 29:06.000
to smite the mansion
and bring it down upon them.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.160
Ooh, aren't you brilliant?

29:08.160 --> 29:12.360
Actually I, I think getting us all
in the cellar was very clever.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.480
Will someone please tell me...

29:14.480 --> 29:15.840
...what--

29:20.760 --> 29:22.000
What have you done to him?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.200
This.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.240
Can I be a blue one?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.480
It's alright. You haven't annoyed me yet.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.680
But can I be?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.600
Oh. Sure.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.360
Oh. They've started early.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.360
Well...

30:07.440 --> 30:09.040
Might as well get comfortable.

30:12.840 --> 30:17.040
Are you... drinking human wine?

30:17.720 --> 30:18.960
It's the source of drunkenness.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.560
Isn't it just?

30:21.680 --> 30:23.040
Mmmm.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.440
Very promising little vineyard.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.760
Yeah alright, you don't drink.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.120
Try the food, though.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.800
You can't get drunk on food.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.080
Go on.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.440
Have an ox-rib.

30:47.040 --> 30:51.000
Are you trying to tempt me?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.320
Not at all.
Angels can't be tempted, can you?

30:53.320 --> 30:55.360
- Certainly not.
- Well, there you are then.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.840
You're free to try the food.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.640
Oh, I say.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.800
Cheers.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.080
Come on! You're a little bit on our side.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.080
Not even the littlest.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.000
Well, you're not
on Hell's side.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.400
I go along with Hell as far as I can.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.800
So whose side are you on?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.360
My side.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
Gosh.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.200
Well, that sounds...

32:12.680 --> 32:14.080
What?

32:14.600 --> 32:15.720
Lonely.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.960
Lonely? No, not lonely.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.520
Whose side are you on?

32:22.960 --> 32:25.240
God's, of course!

32:25.240 --> 32:26.880
Oh, really?

32:27.560 --> 32:29.840
The same God that wants me
to whack the kids?

32:32.480 --> 32:33.800
Yes.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.440
- But...
- Yeah...

32:38.280 --> 32:40.360
That's just how it started for me.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.280
See you in Hell.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.120
Oh, my God!

33:01.120 --> 33:02.960
Blasphemy, Angel? That's not like... you.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.800
No, look! Oh...

33:06.880 --> 33:08.080
My God!

33:09.080 --> 33:11.560
<i>Job, if you have questions for me,</i>

33:11.560 --> 33:13.240
<i>I have questions for you.</i>

33:13.240 --> 33:15.480
<i>Do you know how I created the earth?</i>

33:15.480 --> 33:18.920
<i>Where were you when I laid
the foundations of the earth, Job?</i>

33:18.920 --> 33:21.960
<i>Were you there when all
the morning stars sang together</i>

33:21.960 --> 33:24.280
<i>and all the angels shouted for joy?</i>

33:24.280 --> 33:25.840
- Is God actually...
- I think so.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.200
...talking to him?

33:29.360 --> 33:32.120
- I don't suppose he's getting any answers.
- No.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.920
But just to be able to ask the question.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.360
<i>Do you know
the rules of the heavens?</i>

33:37.360 --> 33:40.280
<i>Did you set the constellations in the sky?</i>

33:40.280 --> 33:44.960
<i>Can you send lightning bolts
and get them to report back to you?</i>

33:44.960 --> 33:47.600
<i>Did you give wings to peacocks, Job,</i>

33:47.600 --> 33:49.640
<i>or teach the ostrich to run?</i>

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
What did God say?

33:57.560 --> 34:00.280
Um... I'm not sure.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.120
I didn't understand much.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.040
Things too wonderful for me.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.160
Ostriches came into it.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.480
- Ostriches?
- And whales.

34:13.240 --> 34:15.800
God's very proud of the whale.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.880
Went into some detail about...
how great whales are.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.080
They explain?

34:26.080 --> 34:27.960
I think the point was,

34:29.200 --> 34:30.880
if you want answers,

34:33.080 --> 34:35.040
come back when you can make a whale.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.560
And the children?

34:37.640 --> 34:40.000
Did They mention the children?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.360
No.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.000
Virtuous Job,

34:54.760 --> 34:55.880
you have passed God's test.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.400
Prepare for your reward.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.520
Behold, where you have lost 300 sheep,

35:01.520 --> 35:04.680
the Lord grants you 600!

35:08.960 --> 35:10.120
Sorry, sorry.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.640
What do you say?

35:15.520 --> 35:16.880
Thank you?

35:16.880 --> 35:19.960
Well, don't thank me. Thank God!

35:20.520 --> 35:22.480
You want me to thank God for sheep?

35:23.640 --> 35:25.080
Our children.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.880
What about our children?

35:26.880 --> 35:27.840
Yes, yeah, yes...

35:27.840 --> 35:29.800
I was... I was, I was getting to that!

35:29.800 --> 35:31.040
For Lo,

35:31.040 --> 35:35.160
though your three children
are completely dead,

35:35.160 --> 35:40.760
God now grants that you may conceive
seven more children!

35:42.920 --> 35:45.960
- Our children are dead?
- Yeah.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.640
But I loved my children!

35:48.760 --> 35:51.640
I don't... I don't want more children.

35:51.760 --> 35:55.320
If my children are dead,
then I will curse God and...

35:55.320 --> 35:57.360
Whoa! Ho-ho...

35:57.360 --> 36:00.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
That never ends well.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.040
Remember me? Bildad the Shuhite?

36:04.040 --> 36:06.280
- Um...
- Who is this?

36:06.280 --> 36:10.160
Err, he says he's Bildad the Shuhite?

36:10.160 --> 36:13.160
And so I am. Bildad the Shuhite.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.840
Need any shoes?

36:17.320 --> 36:20.600
Shuhite of course means
from the land of Shua.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.560
- Yes.
- Indeed, it does.

36:24.560 --> 36:29.160
Where, as it happens,
I am a leading shoemaker.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.200
What, you think they don't wear
shoes in Shua?

36:33.320 --> 36:36.480
Yes, well, it would be really useful

36:36.480 --> 36:41.120
if you were an expert on human births?

36:42.160 --> 36:45.200
Then this is your lucky day!

36:45.320 --> 36:48.000
Shoemaking and obstetrics.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.000
Those have always been the twin passions
of Bildad the Shuhite.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.480
What seems to be the trouble?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.280
Well, um, Sitis here

36:55.280 --> 36:58.640
has just learned
that she is to have lots more children.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.680
Oh! Well!

37:00.800 --> 37:04.360
Let's get started!
No need to be shy, Sitis.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.440
I am a professional midwife slash cobbler.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.760
And I'm sure these angelic entities
have seen it all before.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.840
Yes, in fact Gabriel here

37:12.840 --> 37:17.600
has personally witnessed
childbirth in the Garden of Eden.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.600
Have you now? Wow.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.800
Then I'd better be on my toes,
under the eyes of an expert.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.160
- Oh...
- Ah, um...

37:29.160 --> 37:31.760
...exactly what I say.
Trust me.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.960
Um...

37:34.640 --> 37:36.480
Now, good lady,

37:36.480 --> 37:38.560
simply turn to your husband,

37:39.480 --> 37:41.640
reach into his robes...

37:42.920 --> 37:45.160
H-higher. Higher.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.480
Uh, a little higher...

37:47.480 --> 37:51.680
That's it! And pull out three of his ribs.

37:51.800 --> 37:55.080
Oh yeah. Uh, ribs. It's... Don't worry.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.280
It's all part of the process.
I've seen this before.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.360
And to complete the process,
a simple embrace.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.280
- Mummy!
- Oh!

38:26.760 --> 38:29.480
But... they're not babies.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.200
Certainly not.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.640
Was Eve a baby?

38:32.640 --> 38:33.920
- Was she?
- No, no.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.400
They can arrive in any size.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.640
Ennon, my boy!

38:37.640 --> 38:39.440
- Ennon?
- No, no, no.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.320
Not Ennon, Job. Ennon's gone.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.520
This is your new son.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.840
- But it is--
- A miracle.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.600
It is a miracle that our new son

38:49.600 --> 38:51.640
should look so much like our old son.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.640
- But it is--
- No, Job. Look.

38:54.640 --> 38:58.200
It's not Ennon, it's a new child.

38:58.320 --> 39:02.080
These are all... They're all new children.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.520
No, you're right! It's not Ennon.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.000
Yes, it bloody is.

39:09.880 --> 39:14.320
Aziraphale, are these
the new children God promised Job?

39:17.080 --> 39:19.080
They certainly seem to be.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.120
No, they certainly ought to be.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.120
But they seem to be his old children.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.640
Aziraphale, who are they?

39:30.200 --> 39:31.160
They are...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.160
His new children.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.080
I... You have my word as an angel.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.600
Well, that's alright then. Huh?

39:49.600 --> 39:51.640
Why didn't you just say so?

39:53.800 --> 39:55.520
Congratulations!

40:09.440 --> 40:10.280
Crowley?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.120
He went away.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.840
While you were thinking.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.160
You know, you really used to be...

40:21.440 --> 40:22.400
awful.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.960
I mean, so awful.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.600
Am I awful now?

40:29.800 --> 40:30.920
I don't know.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.080
I hope not.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.560
Oh... Good.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.480
You're the one from yesterday.
Struck by lightning.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.560
It looked worse than it was.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.360
Mr. Six Espressos In a Big Cup.

41:13.640 --> 41:17.400
Silly questions, but how do you feel
about sudden rain?

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
Yeah. That's a silly question alright.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.560
No, but in the event
of a sudden torrential downpour,

41:23.560 --> 41:26.960
would you be likely to shelter
under an awning?

41:27.480 --> 41:29.360
Wow. It--

41:29.360 --> 41:31.440
It's like you've looked deep
into my secret soul.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.040
Well, it's a knack.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.080
For instance...

41:36.360 --> 41:37.920
Oh? Maggie?

41:37.920 --> 41:40.160
Oh, err, no. Not a thing. Definitely.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.760
We're just friends.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.480
Actually, we're not friends.
We barely know each other.

41:43.480 --> 41:45.600
We just got trapped in the shop
when the power went out.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.920
My partner was not impressed.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.760
Well, not a pleasant evening. That's all.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.000
Gotcha.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.480
Do you need a lift somewhere?

42:02.480 --> 42:03.960
Err, no. Thank you.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.800
I was trying to tell you about this.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.280
My Clue.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.640
-"The Resurrectionist."
- Pub.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.160
Has a jukebox.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.840
This record was found on the jukebox.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.200
So what?

42:17.320 --> 42:20.400
So first it wasn't on the jukebox.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.520
It doesn't seem to matter what people
in the pub want to listen to,

42:23.520 --> 42:27.320
sooner or later every record
turns into this.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.880
It is, as you might say... a miracle.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.280
Ooh.

42:32.280 --> 42:36.560
So, I thought I might pop up there myself

42:36.560 --> 42:38.160
and investigate!

42:39.440 --> 42:41.360
Fair enough. What time's your train?

42:41.360 --> 42:43.440
Actually I rather thought
I might take the car.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.880
- What car?
- Our car.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.200
- We don't have a car.
- Of course we do.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.880
Isn't she a beauty?

42:53.880 --> 42:56.160
This Bentley is my car.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.080
Well, yes, technically.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.320
Just as that bookshop is
technically my shop,

43:01.320 --> 43:05.160
but... we both get plenty
of use out of it, don't we?

43:05.160 --> 43:06.640
You can't drive my Bentley.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.480
No, I can! I have a license, yes.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.680
I passed my driving test 90 years ago.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.400
They didn't even require tests,
but I insisted.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.520
No.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.920
Don't worry!

43:17.800 --> 43:20.640
- I'll be very, very careful.
- No!

43:20.640 --> 43:24.160
And while I'm gone,
you can look after the bookshop.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.840
And Gabriel.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.000
Yes?

43:29.040 --> 43:31.480
"It was the day
my grandmother exploded."

43:38.120 --> 43:41.120
"It is a truth universally acknowledged

43:41.120 --> 43:43.680
that a single man
in possession of a good fortune

43:43.680 --> 43:45.760
must be in want of a wife."

43:47.160 --> 43:48.560
Whatever that is.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.440
"It was a nice day."

44:05.400 --> 44:06.440
That's more like it.

44:32.040 --> 44:36.280
Ah. Yes, I thought
perhaps they might send you.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.760
Well...

44:44.280 --> 44:45.320
I'm ready to go.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.400
- Go where?
- To Hell.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.760
I'm not taking you to Hell, Angel.

44:55.800 --> 44:56.880
Why not?

44:56.880 --> 44:58.880
Well, I don't think you'd like it.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.200
But you have to.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.560
I'm like you now.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.640
A demon.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.680
Sorry.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.800
You think you're a demon?

45:23.720 --> 45:26.280
With your curly little...
and your neat white...

45:26.280 --> 45:28.360
I'm a fallen angel!

45:30.680 --> 45:32.240
I lied.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.120
To thwart the will of God.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.520
Well yeah, you did, but...

45:39.720 --> 45:41.120
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.000
Are you?

45:47.080 --> 45:49.560
No. Then nothing has to change, does it?

46:12.920 --> 46:13.920
But what am I?

46:15.400 --> 46:18.680
You're just an angel
who goes along with Heaven

46:18.680 --> 46:20.560
as far as he can.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.480
That sounds, um...

46:27.840 --> 46:28.840
Lonely?

46:31.400 --> 46:32.280
Yeah.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.960
But you said it wasn't.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.320
I'm a demon.

46:39.720 --> 46:40.760
I lied.
