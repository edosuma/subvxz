00:01.268 --> 00:02.534
        (ominous music)

00:02.536 --> 00:03.602
        (glass shatters)

00:28.129 --> 00:32.031
   - Yeah, I just left. I'll
   be home about ten minutes.

00:32.033 --> 00:32.931
           Nightmare.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.102
Right. Well see you seen. Right.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.470
  Well talk to you then. Bye.

00:40.474 --> 00:43.509
      (cellphone ringing)

00:51.218 --> 00:52.084
             Hello?

00:53.254 --> 00:55.087
      Hello, I just found
        this phone here.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.322
             Hello?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.960
           (screams)

01:05.498 --> 01:06.932
           (shouting)

01:06.934 --> 01:09.601
 (shouting in foreign language)

01:09.603 --> 01:12.104
          (screaming)

01:12.106 --> 01:16.108
 (shouting in foreign language)

01:18.946 --> 01:23.115
        (Kyra screaming)
 (shouting in foreign language)

01:23.117 --> 01:25.784
         (man laughing)

01:28.923 --> 01:31.590
         (man whooping)

01:32.760 --> 01:36.728
 (shouting in foreign language)

01:39.600 --> 01:42.668
      (heavy metal music)

02:40.728 --> 02:43.462
        (phone ringing)

02:52.540 --> 02:55.040
           (beeping)

02:55.042 --> 02:56.241
 - [Kyra's Mother] Hey you ...

02:58.379 --> 02:59.244
         it's me again.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.816
    You could just send me a
    text or something, like.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.856
   I'm not angry or anything,
 it's just if you could ring me

03:10.858 --> 03:12.891
   or send me a text and ...

03:14.328 --> 03:15.928
      anyway Jamie's fine.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.707
      (breathing heavily)

03:31.979 --> 03:33.445
  - What the fuck is going on?

03:33.447 --> 03:34.379
    - Shh. Stop shouting or
  else they give you something

03:34.381 --> 03:35.747
   to put you back to sleep.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.783
      - [Kyra] Who's they?
           - Shut up!

03:37.785 --> 03:39.351
           Calm down.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.486
   - Tell me what's going on.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.021
- Your guess is as good as mine.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.392
        - Did they take
      you off the street?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.596
  - I think so. Who are they?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.130
    - There's four of them.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.900
  One English, one Irish, and
  two from Spain or something.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.769
           - Polish.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.139
    - Spanish or Portuguese.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.842
    They're not from Poland.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.410
     I know loads of Polish
  people, if they were Polish

04:05.412 --> 04:07.246
         I'd have known
      from the beginning.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.280
     - From the beginning?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.249
  How long have you been here?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.149
           - A week.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.987
     - Three days, I think.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.689
  Hard to keep track, really.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.761
         (door opening)

04:23.697 --> 04:25.430
     - You're awake, I see.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.799
          (cocks gun)

04:27.801 --> 04:30.302
         Have these two
      told you the rules?

04:30.304 --> 04:31.770
             - No.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.374
  - No screaming. No shouting.
    No going near this door.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.376
   No going near the window.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.544
      You eat the food and
     vitamins we give you.

04:40.814 --> 04:44.383
      No hurting yourself.
    No hurting anyone else.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.353
     No freeing yourselves
        from the ropes.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.756
    Just sit there and wait.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.025
         Are we clear?

04:54.561 --> 04:57.095
     - Wait? Wait for what?

04:58.299 --> 05:02.301
     - For your turn. And a
    new rule. No questions.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.404
     You break any of these
  rules, and you'll be sedated

05:05.406 --> 05:06.905
          immediately.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.806
          Understand?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.143
         You see that?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.811
We're watching you all the time.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.913
       No messing about.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.150
           Good girl.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.423
         (door closes)

05:24.425 --> 05:25.924
  - My turn for fucking what?

05:25.926 --> 05:26.825
          - Not sure.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.762
    When I was first brought
  here there was another girl.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.131
       And after a while
       they took her out

05:33.133 --> 05:35.167
        and I heard her
       scream for hours.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.569
- What? What did they do to her?

05:37.571 --> 05:38.470
        - I don't know.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.442
    - There was another girl
  taken out this morning, too.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.609
     While you were asleep.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.914
 I haven't heard anything yet.

05:48.916 --> 05:52.084
      - They're gonna kill
        us, aren't they?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.153
   Have you tried to escape?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.904
   - Police. It's the police!

06:12.906 --> 06:13.739
             Help!

06:13.741 --> 06:14.573
      - [Alison] Shut up!

06:14.575 --> 06:15.407
            - Help!

06:15.409 --> 06:18.543
      (knocking on window)

06:19.513 --> 06:20.979
      (knocking on window)
             Help!

06:20.981 --> 06:22.581
       - [Lily] Shut up!
         - [Kyra] Help!

06:22.583 --> 06:23.482
        - There you go.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.619
    Is there any way we can
    change over the payments

06:27.621 --> 06:29.921
 for monthly instead of weekly?

06:29.923 --> 06:30.822
    - Not a fucking chance.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.929
           (knocking)

06:37.931 --> 06:39.231
            - Help!
       - [Lily] Shut up!

06:39.233 --> 06:42.634
            - Help!
   - [Alison] Quit shouting!

06:42.636 --> 06:45.370
        (ominous music)

06:50.811 --> 06:51.943
          - They know.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.518
            (gasps)

06:59.520 --> 07:02.020
    - What did I say no less
     than five minutes ago?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.221
          - I'm sorry.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.791
      - Get on the fucking
    floor, you little cunt.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.344
           (screams)

07:08.345 --> 07:10.896
  Fucking middle of the game,
   you little fucking bitch.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.031
            (crying)

07:15.369 --> 07:16.701
     Little fucking tramps.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.110
           (sobbing)

07:41.562 --> 07:42.594
      - What's your name?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.531
            - Kyra.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.669
 - I'm Lily, and that's Alison.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.839
        Do you think you
       could at least try

07:53.841 --> 07:55.574
         and keep your
      fucking mouth shut?

07:56.677 --> 07:57.909
     - You're not even the
    slightest bit concerned

07:57.911 --> 07:59.478
       about what they're
        gonna do to us?

08:00.481 --> 08:01.379
 - They're gonna fuck us, Kyra.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.649
       And then we'll be
       knocked out again

08:04.651 --> 08:06.685
    and fucked out into the
  side of the road somewhere.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.321
     - Can you please stop
       talking like that?

08:11.158 --> 08:14.826
  - Alison doesn't like being
    realistic about things.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.830
     She also doesn't like
    it when I fucking curse.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.101
     This little situation
      we find ourselves in

08:24.204 --> 08:26.271
      I think bad language
     is fucking called for,

08:26.273 --> 08:27.906
what do you fucking think, Kyra?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.774
    - So you're not bothered
    by being raped, are you?

08:31.245 --> 08:32.309
      - I didn't say that.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.847
      I just hope I'm next
       so I can go home.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.318
            (crying)

08:40.320 --> 08:42.687
        - Can you please
     just not shout again?

08:42.688 --> 08:46.324
    Because every time that
      door opens I panic.

08:52.332 --> 08:55.400
       - There has to be
       a way out of here.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.264
        Does he stay out
        there all night?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.633
             - No.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.735
     - Then why haven't you
     jumped out the window?

09:30.737 --> 09:31.670
         - It's locked.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.872
 - Smash it then, Jesus Christ.

09:34.975 --> 09:35.874
           - Alright.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.077
   Do you know where we are?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.214
      We're in the middle
      of fucking nowhere.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.784
             Okay?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.852
   The only noises I've heard
     coming from out there

09:47.854 --> 09:50.989
  are when those scumbag pigs
  come to collect their money

09:50.991 --> 09:52.958
        or they bring in
     another fucking girl.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.227
       Haven't even heard
      a fucking dog bark.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.998
      Do you want to run?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.001
     Run. Get your fucking
        head blown off.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.402
   - Yeah, maybe I will then.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.207
      - By all means. See
        how far you get.

10:10.611 --> 10:15.146
  Ah, but don't forget the eye
  in the sky is watching you.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.825
    The harder you struggle
     the tighter they get.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.979
       - I fucking hope.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.253
        - [Richard] Stop
       acting the rebel.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.287
- I need to go to the bathroom.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.460
         - Stand there.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.168
Right, straight ahead. Move it.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.541
              Go!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.022
          Go! Faster!

12:39.559 --> 12:40.625
          - I like it.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.800
        (birds chirping)

13:07.521 --> 13:10.288
   - Never wanted a cigarette
  so much in my fucking life.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.257
- It's the least of our worries.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.761
  - I take it you don't smoke.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.533
    - Will you just be quiet
  please? I'm trying to think.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.939
  - About what? Your hubby at
  home all worried about you?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.741
- What the fuck is your problem?

13:31.711 --> 13:33.411
 - I need a fucking cigarette.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.679
- Then fucking ask him for one!

13:36.883 --> 13:40.285
    (footsteps approaching)

13:40.287 --> 13:43.087
        (door unlocking)

13:46.993 --> 13:48.526
         - Who was it?

13:48.528 --> 13:49.661
       I said who was it?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.097
             - Me.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.899
           It was me.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.969
    Can you please give this
     fucking bitch a smoke

13:57.971 --> 13:59.704
       so she'll shut up?

13:59.706 --> 14:00.572
            Please?

14:09.783 --> 14:11.115
        - There you go.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.889
           (exhales)

14:22.095 --> 14:26.197
      When you want a fag,
   knock gently on the door.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.266
            (knocks)

14:28.268 --> 14:29.267
          Understand?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.939
       And keep the noise
     level down here, okay?

14:39.412 --> 14:40.612
        (doors locking)

14:40.614 --> 14:41.679
          - Thank you.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.582
      - Don't mention it.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.754
           (exhales)

14:50.690 --> 14:53.324
- Oh I feel dizzy smoking this.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.730
      (breathing heavily)

14:58.732 --> 14:59.631
           I'm sorry.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.968
 - We have to get out of here.

15:05.872 --> 15:08.072
   - Yeah, well the only way
   out is that window, okay?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.241
   And with the police in on
  it we don't stand a chance.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.677
 - I'm not giving up that easy.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.145
  - Don't do anything stupid.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.915
          Let's wait.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.182
     - [Kyra] You said you
      heard screams, yeah?

15:18.184 --> 15:19.484
            - Yeah.
   - [Kyra] A girl screaming?

15:19.486 --> 15:20.685
             - Yup.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.420
      - Why would you not
        even try escape?

15:24.691 --> 15:27.392
     - Because they'd just
     catch me and kill me.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.794
    - [Kyra] That's probably
   what their plan is anyway.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.463
   - Yeah but they might not.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.433
      - Oh, do you want to
    wait here and find out?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.201
    - I don't have a choice.
            - We do.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.438
       I'm going out that
        window. Tonight.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.842
        - If you make it
      will you send help?

15:44.844 --> 15:47.745
       - Of course. I'll
        send the police.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.090
      - I'll go with you.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.294
           - And you?

16:04.831 --> 16:05.730
             - No.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
     - That's your choice.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.189
        (door unlocking)

16:38.264 --> 16:41.766
     - [Richard] Breakfast,
       ladies. Oink oink.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.246
           (beeping)

17:43.696 --> 17:44.929
    - Ah, you look gorgeous.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.834
  - I don't know. Are you sure
  you don't mind looking out?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.669
        I can stay home.
        It's no problem.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.038
    - It's one night. Go out
     and see your friends.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.075
        - I don't know.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.443
       - You deserve it.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.011
      You haven't been out
    since you got pregnant.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.580
     You'll get cabin fever
       sitting up there.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.249
      - I've got Jamie to
      keep me entertained.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.350
     - You need to go find
       yourself a fella.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.219
    - I'm done with fellas.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.155
      - Just go and enjoy
        yourself, yeah?

18:12.659 --> 18:14.158
     - Well just make sure
     that the monitor's on.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.227
    Just check a few times,
   I don't want you twisted.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.163
 if he wakes up anytime crying
   just give me a call, okay?

18:19.165 --> 18:20.698
       - Calm down Kyra.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.134
  I've done this before, yeah?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.537
- I'll be back before one, okay?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.039
   - Okay. And just have fun.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.174
    - Ashley's out tonight,
     to be honest with you

18:30.176 --> 18:33.578
   I'd rather be back by 11.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.412
           Anything.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.913
             - Go.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.148
        - See you later.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.016
     - [Kyra's Mother] See
      you later. Have fun.

18:39.018 --> 18:39.917
             - Bye.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.557
    (volume of TV increases)

18:49.262 --> 18:52.063
        (birds chirping)

18:59.939 --> 19:00.838
            - What?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.207
      - They're not going
      any higher than 80.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.076
       - We need at least
        a hundred grand.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.310
    - I know what I'm doing.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.211
            - Wait.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.622
     (opera music playing)

19:26.332 --> 19:28.900
         (phone rings)

19:31.237 --> 19:32.603
            - Daddy?

19:32.605 --> 19:33.571
       He's maxing at 80.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.608
- No chance. I told you before,
  it's 100 at the very least.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.210
   It's not worth the while.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.312
 Those fucking knuckle-draggers
     understand any English

19:41.314 --> 19:42.213
          whatsoever?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.950
    Hello love. Stay there.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.188
           80 grand.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.891
      - Look at her face.

19:53.893 --> 19:54.825
            - What?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.160
 - She has a black eye already.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.062
       - Oh fucking hell.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.898
  Why is her face all bruised?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.601
 - She put up a bit of a fight
   taking her into the room.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.269
   - Yeah well of course she
   did, they all fucking do.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.837
        Don't hit them.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.339
   - [Richard] It wasn't me.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.174
  - I don't give a flying fuck
 who it was, just don't let it

20:10.176 --> 20:11.542
         happen again.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.444
         - Yes. Sorry.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.779
   - Yeah, give me a minute.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.416
- Early afternoon. Then Alison.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.819
 - Why not Lily or the new one?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.456
       - Because she's so
       innocent looking.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.891
      I'm looking forward
         to her myself.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.862
      - Alright, just give
        it to lunch time

20:31.864 --> 20:33.464
  see if the numbers look up.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.832
      I doubt it, looking
      at the state of her.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.033
          Then Alison.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.102
   - Okay. Talk to you soon.

20:38.104 --> 20:38.970
         - And Richard.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.271
            - Yeah?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.872
      - Remember they have
      to look good, okay?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.808
Keep them in perfect condition.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.510
     - Okay. I'll tell them
      to be more careful.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.888
        - Because she's
       innocent looking.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.924
       I knew there was a
     reason I married you.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.026
           (laughing)

21:02.028 --> 21:04.562
         (opera music)

21:09.769 --> 21:12.169
    - Leave it to lunchtime,
     doesn't go any higher

21:12.171 --> 21:13.804
          take the 80.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.072
            - Okay.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.674
 - Hey, he said one more thing.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.278
           (exhales)

21:20.280 --> 21:21.345
    - [Richard] Tell Boraro
       we need the girls

21:21.347 --> 21:22.713
     looking in good shape.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.282
        That's why we're
       losing that money.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.783
    - What's wrong with her?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.219
   - My dad's been seeing the
  camera. Her face is fucked.

21:28.221 --> 21:29.553
    - [Richard] They need to
    be good-looking to sell,

21:29.555 --> 21:30.788
          understand?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.723
      - You can barely see
       it, look yourself.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.759
  - [Richard] I'm not going in
there, it's fucking disgusting.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.727
   Just tell him, more money.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.096
      You want more money.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.865
     - Okay. I'll tell him.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.533
 But 80's better than nothing.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.269
      - Listen. I went to
   college to study business,

21:45.271 --> 21:46.437
     and 80 between six and
     paying off the police

21:46.439 --> 21:48.339
     is not worth the time.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.574
            - Fine.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.980
        - You hear that?

21:55.982 --> 21:56.981
          - Hear what?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.816
  - You know what all this is?

21:59.786 --> 22:01.285
         - [Lily] What?

22:01.287 --> 22:02.086
       - Why do you think
     they're giving us food

22:02.088 --> 22:03.287
     and looking after us?

22:03.289 --> 22:05.356
       Making sure we're
     okay and stay healthy?

22:06.225 --> 22:07.491
        - I don't know.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.793
      - He basically just
    said good-looking girls

22:08.795 --> 22:09.860
        make more money.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.064
 - What are you talking about?

22:13.066 --> 22:14.098
      - Human trafficking.

22:14.100 --> 22:14.932
        - [Alison] What?

22:14.934 --> 22:15.900
        - The sex trade.

22:16.936 --> 22:17.868
   They're going to sell us.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.270
  I don't fucking believe it.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.139
       - Yeah. Or worse.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.076
        - [Alison] What?

22:25.078 --> 22:28.112
     - I saw a documentary
       about this before.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.280
        It was in China.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.984
     They sell their organs
      on the black market.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.021
 That'd explain the screaming.

22:37.023 --> 22:37.888
      - [Alison] Stop it.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.090
     - [Lily] I'm serious.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.224
       - [Kyra] You still
     staying here tonight?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.826
             - No.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.427
            - Good.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.162
    As soon as the coast is
     clear we jump and run

22:45.164 --> 22:47.431
and get as far away as possible.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.202
    Let's just hope they're
  paying off the local police.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.785
            (sighs)

23:07.787 --> 23:10.121
     - [Andras] 85. That's
    the highest they'll go.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.956
             - 85?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.504
      - I'm not impressed.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.209
     - Won't happen again.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.444
     - What are the costs?

23:34.247 --> 23:35.379
       - What's the cost?

23:35.381 --> 23:37.415
      - [Andras] No cost.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.083
           - No cost.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.418
 - Yeah, well that's something.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.453
        Don't let these
     numbers happen again.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.722
 Tell them to begin in an hour.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.391
   Did you talk to him about
  the condition of the girls?

23:51.297 --> 23:52.196
           - Alison.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.334
        - Good, you take
       charge down there.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.637
      Tell Matthew to put
   Alison on the slate next.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.972
     Tomorrow morning 9:00.

24:01.974 --> 24:02.840
            - Okay.

24:06.012 --> 24:06.844
           (exhales)

24:06.846 --> 24:08.612
        One hour, okay?

24:08.614 --> 24:09.980
        - [Andras] Okay.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.782
    - Are we going to watch?

24:11.784 --> 24:12.817
      - Of course we are?

24:15.354 --> 24:16.854
        If you want to.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.456
 - Oh you know I love to watch.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.525
      Will you hook it up
       to the TV for me?

24:21.527 --> 24:23.093
       I like to watch it
       on the big screen.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.929
     - I know. Yes I will.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.265
       (knocking at door)

25:34.267 --> 25:35.299
          - Step back.

25:39.405 --> 25:42.606
        (door unlocking)

25:42.608 --> 25:43.507
             What?

25:44.677 --> 25:47.077
  - Can I have a smoke please?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.494
       (woman screaming)

26:17.877 --> 26:20.978
- Get on the fucking floor now!

26:20.980 --> 26:22.413
        - What the fuck
       is going on here?

26:22.415 --> 26:24.515
     - Stay on the fucking
        floor you cunt!

26:24.517 --> 26:26.517
      Stay on the fucking
       floor all of you!

26:26.519 --> 26:29.420
       (woman screaming)

26:40.166 --> 26:41.131
   What the fuck is going on?

26:41.133 --> 26:42.700
       - She's waking up.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.902
    - [Richard] Give her the
     fucking ketamine then.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.705
     - Buyer requested that
      she's awake for it.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.540
      - [Richard] Is that
        camera rolling?

26:49.542 --> 26:51.075
            - Yeah.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.242
  - [Richard] Turn it fucking
  off, this isn't a free show.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.447
   Put a message on the site
 and check back in 20 minutes.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.982
       If anyone but the
      buyer wants to watch

26:57.984 --> 27:00.551
   they're paying 25% extra.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.889
    (woman screaming loudly)

27:05.891 --> 27:07.591
  I can't fucking watch this.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.792
  20 minutes Matthew, alright?

27:08.794 --> 27:09.693
            - Yeah.

27:10.630 --> 27:14.098
    (woman screaming loudly)

27:20.873 --> 27:23.941
      (breathing heavily)

27:24.977 --> 27:26.710
     - What are they doing
        to her in there?

27:26.712 --> 27:28.178
       - I have no idea.

28:10.723 --> 28:15.759
     - I'm gonna go to the
    study and do some work.

28:17.663 --> 28:18.562
            - Okay.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.447
            (typing)

28:49.495 --> 28:51.562
    - Fucking start already.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.444
      (heavy metal music)

29:07.446 --> 29:09.780
           (grunting)

29:12.051 --> 29:14.585
     - Dirty fucking whore.

29:14.587 --> 29:17.488
       (woman screaming)

29:19.558 --> 29:20.524
          Yeah! Yeah!

29:22.561 --> 29:24.962
          (screaming)

29:54.527 --> 29:56.860
           (chortles)

30:09.475 --> 30:10.374
        You dirty bitch!

30:11.610 --> 30:13.610
    You know you want this!

30:20.719 --> 30:22.953
           (screams)

30:32.665 --> 30:33.564
           Die bitch!

30:34.400 --> 30:35.299
              Die!

30:37.937 --> 30:40.904
       (unsettling music)

31:08.934 --> 31:11.835
       (talking from TV)

32:47.533 --> 32:49.166
           (whistles)

32:49.168 --> 32:50.033
            - Done.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.509
       - Yeah it's done.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.447
  - I know. We were watching.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.681
 A longer bid for the next one,

33:04.683 --> 33:06.316
 I don't care if it takes days.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.751
  They'll give in eventually.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.188
   - Okay, talk to you soon.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.929
           (exhales)

34:19.324 --> 34:20.456
        - [Andras] Hey!

34:20.458 --> 34:22.759
           (laughing)

34:24.396 --> 34:27.197
        (birds chirping)

34:32.670 --> 34:33.570
            - Fuck.

34:56.527 --> 34:57.928
       - Down the hatch!

34:57.930 --> 34:59.663
      - [Kyra] What is it?

34:59.665 --> 35:02.099
       - Doesn't matter.
      It's strong. Ready?

35:02.101 --> 35:04.801
        One, two, three.

35:06.972 --> 35:10.107
             - Ah!
    - Jesus, it's horrible!

35:10.109 --> 35:11.808
      - You've been out of
     the game way too long.

35:11.810 --> 35:12.676
           - Thanks.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.814
   - So, see anyone you like?

35:17.816 --> 35:18.682
            - What?

35:20.652 --> 35:23.553
    - Guy over there at the
     bar. Wearing the tie.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.355
             - No!

35:26.725 --> 35:28.725
   - What are you serious? I
    think he's good-looking.

35:28.727 --> 35:32.262
     I think Kyra's turned
   into a bit of a man-hater.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.697
 - No, with good reason though.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.165
     - I'm not a man-hater.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.001
    Did you just take me out
   to get the piss out of me?

35:38.003 --> 35:39.870
       - No, we took you
       out to get pissed.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.839
            - Right.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.107
            - Sorry.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.275
         No more jokes.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.110
       - Yeah, we're just
    having a laugh with you.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.016
          More shots?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.357
      - She hasn't changed
        at all, has she?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.425
   - [Holly] Mad as a brush.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.128
        - Hello ladies.

36:05.130 --> 36:05.962
  - [Holly] Hey, how are you?

36:05.964 --> 36:07.230
    - Not bad and yourself?

36:07.232 --> 36:09.199
      - It'd be better if
      you got me a drink.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.133
            (laughs)

36:10.135 --> 36:11.501
- No offense. What's your name?

36:11.503 --> 36:12.569
        - [Holly] Holly.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.004
            - Holly?

36:14.006 --> 36:15.839
      This girl was saying
        over at the bar

36:15.841 --> 36:17.541
   I ought to come over here.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.875
          - Oh really?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.677
    And what was she saying?

36:20.679 --> 36:21.778
        - That you just
       need a good time.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.712
          - Oh my god.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.014
  - Come on, and have a dance.

36:24.016 --> 36:24.848
            Come on.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.283
          - No thanks.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.785
   - Oh, come on. Get up and
dance. Don't leave him hanging.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.223
      - A dance? Alright?
         And that's it.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.391
       - [Man] That's it.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.859
       - Alright. Go on.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.139
 - If it comes to it next time,

36:49.141 --> 36:51.541
  Daddy says we sit through or
   two or three days bidding,

36:51.543 --> 36:52.909
   til we hear a good price.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.379
     However long it takes
      to get what we need.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.549
       Today was a loss.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.952
     - We still made money.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.320
           I'm happy.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.821
     - Yeah, but we should
        have made more.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.323
       - Money is money.

37:06.325 --> 37:09.125
   - I stay out there all day
    walking back and forth.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.194
     Fucking boring, I want
      more money as well.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.463
- So I take your job, take mine.

37:13.465 --> 37:14.364
             - No.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.967
  - You have no fucking balls.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.034
    - I'm not fucking crazy.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.170
  - Fuck it. I'll do anything.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.605
   Isn't that right, Matthew?

37:23.208 --> 37:24.307
       He loves my work.

37:25.777 --> 37:30.313
      Shoots it in for his
     eyes. Makes him hard.

37:30.315 --> 37:33.116
           (laughing)

37:33.118 --> 37:35.518
         You and me saw
       this fucking fuck.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.321
       You wanna see how
        he looked like?

37:38.323 --> 37:39.222
             Watch.

37:42.027 --> 37:46.630
      Matthew. Look at me.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.632
    Look at me. Look at me.

37:50.202 --> 37:51.835
      Show him your face.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.637
    Cry like a little bitch.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.143
           (inhales)

38:00.145 --> 38:01.611
   - [Richard] That's enough.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.313
       - That's the look.
        That's the look.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.881
     Like a virgin seeing a
    cock for the first time.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.217
           (laughing)

38:08.887 --> 38:11.254
   - He has more brains than
     you two put together.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.923
   If it wasn't for him none
   of this would be possible.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.960
    He's lining our pockets.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.061
     - I love you Matthew.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.397
           (laughing)

38:34.146 --> 38:37.347
Don't know why you're laughing.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.281
             - Why?

38:38.283 --> 38:40.183
 - You're a little bitch, too.

38:42.254 --> 38:45.088
       Tell Matthew about
     your tattoo. Tell him.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.190
 He's been through a lot today.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.692
   - He knows what it means.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.527
- [Andras] Do you know Matthew?

38:50.529 --> 38:52.195
    Do you know Portuguese?

38:52.197 --> 38:53.096
             - No.

38:54.266 --> 38:56.399
     - [Boraro] He probably
       Google it. Stupid.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.468
    - No he fucking did not.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.704
   Isn't that right Matthew?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.672
    - That's right, Richard.

39:05.077 --> 39:08.144
     - He has access to the
  website and that site only.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.015
        - That's right.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.974
    - Enough. Speak fucking
 English when you're around me.

39:38.844 --> 39:39.743
        What's going on?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.078
       - It means beast.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.513
           You know.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.715
        - I was aware of
     that. I looked it up.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.684
 - Yeah, it's like in English,
   you know like the teardrop

39:47.686 --> 39:48.752
        under your eye?

39:48.754 --> 39:50.120
         Gangster shit.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.087
          - Gangster.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.190
       (Andras laughing)

39:54.192 --> 39:55.692
   - Do you know I'm going to
    kill the next one, then.

39:55.694 --> 39:56.659
         I don't care.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.030
       - You have nothing
        to prove to me.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.133
       Everything is fine
         the way it is.

40:03.135 --> 40:04.234
     That's the end of it.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.242
      - [Andras] Dessert?

40:12.244 --> 40:13.810
       - What've you got?

40:15.480 --> 40:16.379
           - Custard.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.783
        - [Richard] Yes
       please. Thank you.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.788
       Matthew, would you
       like some dessert?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.058
           - Please.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.362
       - [Andras] Boraro?

40:32.364 --> 40:33.229
         - [Boraro] No.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.066
           Thank you.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.737
      - Now. Happy family.

40:42.174 --> 40:43.039
         That's better.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.747
   - So we have to decide if
 we're going to stick together

40:50.749 --> 40:52.015
     or split up out there.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.484
       What do you think?

40:54.486 --> 40:57.754
      - I think we should
        stick together.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.122
             - No.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.390
           Split up.

41:00.392 --> 41:02.125
       One of us makes it
        we can get help.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.061
     That's better than all
  three of us getting caught.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.331
     - You're right. Better
     chance if we split up.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.334
  No holding each other back.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.337
 If any of us get caught we'll
 get help from whoever escapes.

41:14.339 --> 41:15.839
    - What about the guards?

41:15.841 --> 41:16.673
           They know.

41:16.675 --> 41:17.607
     - They can't all know.

41:17.609 --> 41:18.908
It's probably just a couple few.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.311
          - I hope so.

41:23.782 --> 41:24.681
        - Another thing.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.450
    Instead of breaking the
 window, I think we should try

41:27.452 --> 41:29.152
      break the lock first

41:29.154 --> 41:31.454
     Breaking the window's
   gonna make too much noise.

41:31.456 --> 41:32.956
        If it comes down
        to it, we do it.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.691
    We have nothing to lose.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.860
            (crying)

41:39.631 --> 41:40.530
            - Fuck.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.467
      They want us in good
        condition, yeah?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.270
     They're not gonna hurt
    us if we try and escape.

41:47.272 --> 41:48.705
          They won't.

41:48.707 --> 41:49.772
      - They're giving us
  vitamins to keep us healthy

41:49.774 --> 41:50.707
        for fuck's sake.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.009
           (laughing)

41:54.379 --> 41:57.046
           (sobbing)

41:57.048 --> 41:58.715
         - Okay. Okay.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.250
         - [Kyra] Okay.
            - Okay.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.117
            - Okay.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.120
           That's it.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.021
            We wait.

42:06.525 --> 42:08.858
       This time tomorrow
         we'll be home.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.194
    And those scumbags will
     be locked up or dead.

42:12.063 --> 42:13.863
     Hopefully the latter.

42:20.372 --> 42:21.871
       Okay. Act normal.

42:26.978 --> 42:30.380
    (footsteps approaching)

42:36.588 --> 42:39.389
        (snoring loudly)

42:59.044 --> 43:00.577
           - Matthew?
            - What?

43:03.248 --> 43:04.447
             What?

43:04.449 --> 43:08.851
           (slapping)
            (grunts)

43:17.629 --> 43:20.229
           (laughing)

43:20.231 --> 43:21.464
          - The beast.

43:21.466 --> 43:23.600
            (laughs)

43:29.374 --> 43:31.608
           (raining)

43:34.679 --> 43:37.580
       (heavy breathing)

43:38.617 --> 43:40.717
      - [Lily] Let me try.

43:40.719 --> 43:43.019
           (grunting)

43:52.931 --> 43:55.665
- They didn't hear it, hurry up.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.469
         - Help me up.

44:00.505 --> 44:02.739
           (grunting)

44:12.684 --> 44:15.385
     - I can't see a thing.
        It's pitch dark.

44:15.387 --> 44:17.120
      - [Kyra] Oh come on.

44:25.430 --> 44:27.263
        (intense music)

44:27.265 --> 44:30.600
     (heart beating loudly)

44:38.076 --> 44:40.476
          (screaming)

44:51.923 --> 44:52.755

45:39.838 --> 45:41.170
         You hear what
      happened out there?

45:41.172 --> 45:43.306
        Do not try that
     fucking shit with me.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.541

46:25.717 --> 46:27.784
        Bandage her up.

46:27.786 --> 46:28.618
    Bandage her fucking up.

46:28.620 --> 46:31.020
          (screaming)

46:35.226 --> 46:37.627
  - [Andras] Shut the fuck up!

           (beeping)

47:20.772 --> 47:21.904
          - The phone.

47:21.906 --> 47:24.240
    The phone. It's Richard.

47:25.043 --> 47:26.742
       - Fucking Richard?

47:26.744 --> 47:28.211
            - Here.

47:28.213 --> 47:29.779
        - What's wrong.

47:29.781 --> 47:31.747
    - They tried to escape.

47:31.749 --> 47:34.016
        One of them got
       out of the house.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.351
       - What the fuck do
      you mean one of them

47:35.353 --> 47:36.786
     got out of the house?

47:36.788 --> 47:39.522
    - [Richard] We have her.
    She landed on the nails.

47:39.524 --> 47:40.790
      She won't be healthy
      for at least a week.

47:40.792 --> 47:41.824
      - Which one of them
        was it, Alison?

47:41.826 --> 47:43.392
     - [Richard] No. Lily.

47:43.394 --> 47:44.794
       - Is Alison okay?

47:44.796 --> 47:46.329
    - What about the others?

47:46.331 --> 47:47.830
   - [Richard] They're fine.

47:47.832 --> 47:48.631
   - Alison's still good for
    tomorrow morning though,

47:48.633 --> 47:50.566
     that's the main thing.

47:50.568 --> 47:52.101
       - [Richard] Okay.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.502
        - Fucking hell.

47:53.504 --> 47:55.171
       That fucking boy.

47:55.173 --> 47:57.740
 Never ceases to disappoint me.

47:57.742 --> 47:58.875
         Fucking hell.

48:03.815 --> 48:06.015
    - [Mam] Shh, it's okay.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.083
    - [Dad] I don't fucking
        believe that boy

48:07.085 --> 48:08.951
      comes from my loins.

48:08.953 --> 48:11.988
          - [Mam] Shh.
    - [Dad] Fucking idiots.

48:11.990 --> 48:14.290
           (groaning)

48:20.765 --> 48:22.999
           (sobbing)

48:24.969 --> 48:26.736
  - [Richard] Look at her now!

48:26.738 --> 48:27.637
            Behave!

48:29.774 --> 48:32.408
         (door locking)

48:42.987 --> 48:44.520
     - [Kyra] Are you okay?

48:44.522 --> 48:46.656
            - Yeah.

48:46.658 --> 48:48.157
           I'm fine.

48:48.159 --> 48:51.560
      - [Alison] Oh Jesus
      Christ, look at you.

48:52.897 --> 48:55.298
 - There's no way out of here.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.533

49:51.022 --> 49:51.854
       - [Man] Who is it?

49:51.856 --> 49:52.755
           - Get out.

49:53.758 --> 49:56.058
           - Oh fuck.
       - Oh fuck's sake.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.562
          Fuck's sake.

49:59.564 --> 50:01.430

50:11.376 --> 50:12.875
 He was in the girls fighting.

50:12.877 --> 50:14.076

50:14.078 --> 50:14.977
           Good luck.

50:23.921 --> 50:25.087

   - There is the beast. No!

52:35.820 --> 52:37.953

52:37.955 --> 52:39.221

52:39.223 --> 52:41.724

        Let go! Let go!

52:44.662 --> 52:45.561

52:56.941 --> 52:57.806
        - She struggled.

53:00.077 --> 53:02.211
 - What did I fucking tell you?

53:02.213 --> 53:03.979
        - He just wanted
       to prove it to me.

53:03.981 --> 53:06.582
         - This is your
     fucking job, not his.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.818
      She's worth a lot of
       money. That's all.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.086
      Fix her fucking up.

 Just get her fixed fucking up.

            (moans)

53:53.497 --> 53:54.597

  Brains, are we ready to go?

54:28.766 --> 54:29.665

             Okay.

54:55.660 --> 54:56.558
            Go live.

            (typing)

55:27.258 --> 55:28.757
        - Keep bidding.

55:28.759 --> 55:31.460
  I'll find out where you live
   and I'll fucking kill you.

55:39.003 --> 55:39.968
          - Fuck off.

55:41.772 --> 55:42.671
            Fuck it.

 - Have you been up all night?

56:03.427 --> 56:04.326
            - Yeah.

56:05.129 --> 56:06.428
    - You need to go to bed.

56:06.430 --> 56:08.464
         You can't keep
       working like this.

56:10.368 --> 56:11.667
     Do you want breakfast?

56:13.637 --> 56:16.538
        - Do I look like
       I want breakfast?

56:18.075 --> 56:21.009
   - Don't forget, my nephew
      gets here real soon.

56:28.085 --> 56:30.152
            (sighs)

56:35.459 --> 56:38.527
      (breathing heavily)

56:48.572 --> 56:50.139
       - What's going on?

56:54.345 --> 56:55.244
            - Sorry.

56:59.450 --> 57:00.349
         - Where am I?

57:01.886 --> 57:03.218
      - Not a good place.

57:05.790 --> 57:08.257
   But look, you're in shock.

57:11.729 --> 57:12.995
    But you, you'll be fine.

57:24.508 --> 57:26.008
  - I wasn't, you didn't even
    hear me talking to her.

57:26.010 --> 57:29.111
    - [Richard] What'd I say
     about talking to them?

57:29.113 --> 57:30.579
        What we at now?

57:31.515 --> 57:32.381
           - 175,000.

59:19.823 --> 59:22.124
  Nobody fucking beats David.

59:49.153 --> 59:50.218
          You bastard.

              Why?

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.762
           - Jackpot!

        (phone ringing)

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.654
      - [Richard] He maxed
       out, full shower.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.189
       - I know, we were
   watching. Good work, son.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.025
    How's the other girl, is
  she still in good condition?

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:05.827
 - [Richard] Kyra? Yeah, she's
   ready to go when you are.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.663
  - That's what I wanna hear.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:10.365
     Her tomorrow morning,
     Alison in 15 minutes.

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.334
     If any of the watchers
   want to see the full show,

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.236
      they pay 50% extra.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.709
- Full show on the little bitch.

01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:22.144
           - Oh yeah.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:23.779
    - I think I'll get some
    wine. Do you want some?

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:24.846
         - Yeah, go on.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:31.753
           (smacking)
           (giggles)

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:43.331
   - 15 minutes. Wake her up.

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:50.539
   Matthew, 50% extra for the
    watchers. No exceptions.

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:57.345
           (clicking)

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:11.860
           (sniffing)

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:36.618
        (intense music)

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:51.533
           (slapping)

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.168
      - Wake the fuck up!

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.072
      - That is beautiful.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.977
    You silly fucking whore.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:18.360
          (whimpering)

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:19.261
           - No, no.

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:26.935
          (screaming)

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:39.648
           - Christ.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.801
          (whimpering)

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.218
         - Oh yeah ...

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.554
       Oh that's what I'm
    talking about right now.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:22.557
       (Alison screaming)

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:38.473
           (grunting)
           - Oh fuck.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.646
            (typing)

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:47.649
       (Alison screaming)

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:50.752
           (laughing)

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.065
          (screaming)

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.412
            (typing)

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.417
        - What the fuck?

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.554
- Why the fuck would he log off?

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:30.025
   - Pretty fucking strange.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:31.927
        - What an idiot.

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:34.629
         Fucking money.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:35.797
         Fucking twat.

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:43.238
        - What's wrong?

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.809
  - This piece of fucking shit
   internet is what's wrong.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.647
   It's costing me big money,
    Gina. Big fucking money.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.050
          (screaming)

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:02.791
            - Relax.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:04.793
           Calm down.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.596
          Maybe Jacob.

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.632
 He was playing with the wires.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:14.102
            - What?

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:16.504
       - Jacob. Maybe he
      pulled on the wires.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.842
         - What did you
       fucking say to me?

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:25.180
            - Baby.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.116
    - Have you any idea how
   much money this is fucking

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:29.017
            cost me?

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:34.022
       (Alison screaming)

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.825
   - He's just a kid, David.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.461
     - Do you think he ...

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.600
  Can you do me a favor Gina?

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:49.404
       Can you turn back
        on the internet

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:52.540
       before I lose any
      more fucking money!

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.245
 - You need to take your Xanax

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:59.080
before you have a heart attack.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.450
  - You think I need a Xanax?

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.620
Maybe that's what I need, Gine.

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.322
     Maybe I need a Xanax.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:09.824
 Maybe I need a fucking Xanax!

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.794
       (Alison screaming)

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:15.030
           (moaning)

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:23.338
            - No ...

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.073
             No ...

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:28.943
            (crying)

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.083
       - Cut her up, man!

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.686
       You don't get paid
        to fuck around!

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.690
           (laughing)

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:43.525
            (crying)

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:48.596
       - Please stop ...

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.571
        Please stop ...

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:00.075
            (groans)

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:01.209
           - Harder.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:02.844
            Oh fuck!

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:03.978
         - Get off me!

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:06.181
            Please!

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.784
            (crying)

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.658
         Get off me ...

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.439
 - I want my tag on her chest!

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.776
           (laughing)

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.850
 Put my user name on her chest!

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:45.587
      I'm not some fucking
   douche bag that logs off!

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.055
             Damn!

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:48.288
         What the fuck?

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.960
           (groaning)

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.127
         - Oh fuck ...

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.883
      Oh fucking bite me.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:28.062
           (grunting)

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.082
           (laughing)

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:13.274
           (laughing)

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:21.583
         - She's done.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:22.483
           - Bye bye.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.519
            Bye bye.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:26.754
           - End it.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.937
           (whistles)

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.205
            - Done?

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:45.073
             - Yes.

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:47.475
   I'm gonna hit the shower.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.286
            - Boss?

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:00.622
            - What?

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.292
       - The buyer wants
      to talk to someone.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:14.135
  Buyer has a special request.

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.838
    - [Richard] What is it?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.773
       - He said he wants
      to talk to someone.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.509
  - [Richard] Where's he from?

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.877
        - He's using an
       encrypted browser

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:25.880
  but he's paying in dollars.

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:27.115
          - Is he new?

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:29.284
       - No. He's one of
        our best buyers.

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:31.586
        Been about here
      for six months now.

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:35.223
     - Can you disguise my
    voice when you call him?

01:11:35.225 --> 01:11:36.891
            - Yeah.

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:38.126
       - Alright. Do it.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:41.763
            (typing)

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.868
       (breathing hardly)

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:49.070
           (beeping)

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:53.308
    (talking through walls)

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:58.413
       (toddler babbling)

01:11:58.415 --> 01:11:59.280
            - Hello.

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:04.552
 - [Richard] What do you want?

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.054
- I want a fucking private show.

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:07.021
       - [Child] Mama ...

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:10.825
        - [Richard] That
        can be arranged.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.094
        What you like in
       this private show?

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.963
- [David] I want the full show.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.965
      - [Richard] Did you
    not enjoy the last one?

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:22.670
 (child babbling through walls)

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:23.504
       (child squealing)

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:24.639
       - I want a child.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:28.843
             A boy.

01:12:32.082 --> 01:12:33.281
    Two or three years old.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.420
         You get that?

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:50.064
   - Come here for a minute.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:56.671
        That buyer has a
        special request.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:58.573
         - What is it?

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.144
     - Now, I haven't said
     this to my father yet.

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:07.115
   I wanted to ask you first.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.150
            - What?

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.419
           - A child.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.190
    Are you okay with that?

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:17.091
          - How much?

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.593
    - He offered 4 million.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:20.762
            - Okay.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.369
        (phone ringing)

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.606
       First of all, the
        show went great.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:34.442
      She lasted a good 20
    minutes before she died.

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:35.676
       - Yeah, and go on.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.713
      - [Richard] There's
       a buyer. Good one.

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.784
    Good record of bidding.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:46.788
     I think he's addicted.
     Has a special request.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:48.556
            A child.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.927
           - A child.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:53.828
             Oh ...

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:56.063
         No, too risky.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:58.566
 - [Richard] He said 4 million.

01:13:58.568 --> 01:14:00.134
          - 4 million?

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:01.602
   - [Richard] Private show.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.337
       Only him watching.

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:05.006
            - When?

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:06.574
- [Richard] As soon as possible.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.643
      - Just him watching?
          No one else?

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:11.345
      Straight up murder,
    that's it? Nothing else?

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:13.548
 - I made it clear to him that
   it's strictly murder only.

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:15.817
     That's what he wants.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:16.684
            - Okay.

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:20.955
    Okay. Get Matthew to put
     a message on the site,

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:22.156
        what's her name?

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:22.990
       - [Richard] Kyra.

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.459
         - Kyra, yeah.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.194
    Send those two goons out
  first thing in the morning.

01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:28.329
        Get this done as
       soon as possible.

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:30.998
       - Tell him cash up
      front. No shortcuts.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.200
    - You hear that Richard?

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:34.001
        Your mother says
      cash up front only.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.204
    Don't fuck this up, lad.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.373
            - Okay.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:48.649
      - 4 fucking million.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:51.886
 We can fucking retire on that.

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:52.787
            - Yeah.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.223
 What would we do for fun then?

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.625
      - Oh, I'm sure we'd
      think of something.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:59.060
           (laughing)

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:00.495
      - 4 fucking million.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:06.367
             Fuck.

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:12.807
  - She's missing days and you
   haven't even got a report

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:14.342
         in the paper!

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.682
    I know my own daughter.
     She wouldn't do this.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.950
       It's not like her!

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:25.319
      She was ten minutes
      away from the house!

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:27.255
I know my own fucking daughter!

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:33.895
    What are you telling me
   to calm fucking down for?!

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:37.398
              No!

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:41.302
         Fucking prick!

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:50.077
       - [Child] Mama ...

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.364
            (typing)

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.172
        (door unlocking)

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.870
         (door locking)

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.496
          - It's fake.

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:18.232
      - What's the matter?

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:19.333
      - They can't see us.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.737
    - Yeah, but we're still
    fucking trapped in here.

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:39.587
        (birds chirping)

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:55.436
    - I didn't know whether
      to wake you or not.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.573
 They sent them out for a baby.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:04.478
        - Fucking scum!

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.816
    Fucking scumbags, I hope
   you fucking die screaming!

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:11.218
          (screaming)

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:22.563
  - Sleeping beauty is awake.

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.298
    - A baby, you sick fuck!

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.866
        - Stay away from
       that fucking door!

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.601
       - Fuck you! Shoot
       me you posh prick!

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:29.837
           (panting)

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.025
          (door opens)

01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.794
       - [Richard] Where
        the fuck is she?

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.864
     - Stupid bitch is gone
     again. Out the window.

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:10.304
        - You sick fuck!

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:13.507
              Die!

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.209
              Die!

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:19.413
           You prick!

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.250
           (grunting)

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:24.151
              Die!

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:29.123
           (panting)

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.703
       - No! Don't shoot!

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.473
            Please.

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:47.441
        - What the fuck
       is wrong with you?

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:48.275
  - I'm the same as you, look!

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:49.376
    They're making me do it!

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:53.581
          (whimpering)

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:57.484
    - What the fuck is this?

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.253
   - Murder for money online.

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:00.554
            - What?

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:02.223
      - People pay to see
      people get murdered!

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:07.962
            Look ...

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:10.464
 I know how to run the website.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.633
    That's why they took me.

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:17.771
        - Where are we?

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:19.073
        - I don't know.

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:22.643
            Please!

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:23.777
      Please shoot it off.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.348
     - How do I know you're
        not one of them?

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:31.952
       - Because you'd be
       fucking dead now.

01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.657
   - The tools on the drawer.

01:21:37.526 --> 01:21:38.626
       The knife, get it!

01:21:40.796 --> 01:21:41.929
          The toolbox!

01:21:49.839 --> 01:21:50.704
        Faster, come on!

01:21:56.612 --> 01:22:00.547
      I've been here three
   fucking years, look at me!

01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:02.950
            - Do it!

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:05.352
             Do it!

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.560
    - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.365
           (grunting)

01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:54.368
        (child babbling)

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:50.157
       (slow piano music)

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:02.930
            (crying)

01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:17.010
         - Mom it's me.

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:17.911
            - Kyra?

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.014
    - I'm okay. I was taken.

01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:25.986
- Oh Jesus, Kyra. Are you okay?

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.258
      - I'm gonna be okay,
        I'm coming home.

01:25:33.028 --> 01:25:34.928
        I'm coming home.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.998
      (heavy metal music)

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.435
         - Kyra! Kyra!

01:25:55.985 --> 01:25:59.286
        - Come on, it's
     okay. You're alright.

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:00.554
         I'm gonna take
      after you, come on.

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:01.622
      I'll look after you.

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:02.489
            Come on.

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:09.830
          (screaming)

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:10.731
            - Kyra!

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.386
      - Don't look at me!

01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:34.721
           (laughing)

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:41.762
       Don't look at me.

01:26:42.298 --> 01:26:44.531
        (intense music)

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:48.395
           (panting)

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:56.036
        (phone ringing)

01:27:56.038 --> 01:27:58.572
   - Why the fuck haven't you
    been answering my calls?

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.174
           - Listen.

01:28:01.176 --> 01:28:02.576
  They're all dead, it's over.

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:05.279
   I don't know who you are,
    but I won't tell a soul,

01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:06.680
            I swear.

01:28:06.682 --> 01:28:08.682
  I just my normal life back.

01:28:10.319 --> 01:28:11.952
    - Who the fuck is that?

01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:14.688
     - Is this you Matthew?

01:28:17.192 --> 01:28:18.091
            - Yeah.

01:28:20.863 --> 01:28:23.330
       - Matthew tell me
     exactly what happened.

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:25.132
 - They're all dead, everyone.

01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:26.266
     A house full of them.

01:28:28.871 --> 01:28:30.203
   I don't know who you are.

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:34.741
   But you'll never hear from
   me again, I swear to god.

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:36.943
      - Matthew, Matthew,
      we have to meet up.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.378
    We have to discuss this.

01:28:39.315 --> 01:28:40.714
  Can you come over this way?

01:28:43.185 --> 01:28:46.086
    - You have no idea what
  you're getting yourself into

01:28:46.088 --> 01:28:47.654
      you little bastard.

01:28:58.434 --> 01:29:01.134
      - Matthew. Matthew?

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:04.571
             Cunt.

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:08.041
      Little fucking cunt.

01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:11.778
       I'll fucking kill
       the little cunts.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:14.748
You fucking little fucking cunts

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:15.982
          And Richard!

01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:18.418
      What the fuck are we
    thinking, he can't even

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.487
 tie his own fucking shoelaces!

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:22.422
      This is the biggest
       clusterfuck ever!

01:29:23.926 --> 01:29:25.592
 4 fucking million quid, gone!

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:27.961
         Fucking gone.

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:28.895
            Retire?

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:31.698
   I'll fucking retire, yeah.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.400
         Fucking cunts.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.653
 What the fuck are we gonna do?

01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:30.457
       - [Mam] Catherine.

01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.428
         - I don't know
     fucking family again?

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:35.729
   Do you think she's ready?

01:30:37.132 --> 01:30:39.833
        - She's got more
      brains than Richard.

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:41.968
      - Yeah that wouldn't
     be fucking difficult.

01:30:46.742 --> 01:30:49.042
  Yeah, you're fucking right.

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:55.882
        (man screaming)

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:58.585
        (phone ringing)

01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:08.228
            - Hello?

01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:11.431
       Shut the fuck up!

01:31:11.433 --> 01:31:13.834
          (screaming)

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:16.336
          - Catherine?

01:31:17.506 --> 01:31:19.272
    The other house is gone.

01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:21.174
            - What?

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:23.443
     - One of the captives
     didn't remain captive.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.312
       It's a long story.
       They're all dead.

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:27.714
          - Your son.

01:31:28.684 --> 01:31:30.217
        - Yup. Him too.

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:33.086
     You ready to go live?

01:31:34.456 --> 01:31:36.189
           (panting)

01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:37.524
 - Been practicing for months.

01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:40.927
            - Okay.

01:31:42.231 --> 01:31:44.331
     We'll have you up and
  running in a couple of days.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.967
 Catherine, don't mess this up.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.104
     - You can rely on me.

01:31:51.106 --> 01:31:51.972
          - Good girl.

01:31:58.146 --> 01:31:59.279
         Back on track.

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:02.382
     Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:05.719
           Fuck yeah.

01:32:07.623 --> 01:32:10.190
         (man sobbing)

01:32:16.498 --> 01:32:18.899
  - Guess who got a promotion?

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:24.771
          (screaming)

01:32:36.118 --> 01:32:37.450
     - We go live on five.

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:47.193
       (heavy rock music)
