WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:02.252
Previously on "All Stars"...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.129
We've arisen from the dead.

00:05.464 --> 00:06.506
Goop.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.842
I had chosen
to send home Valentina.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.678
- Valentina.
- Ooh, girl.

00:11.678 --> 00:15.474
We're having
a lip sync LalapaRuza.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.768
Girl, gag.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.520
Four queens that were eliminated

00:20.520 --> 00:21.855
are about to lip sync
against four queens

00:21.855 --> 00:23.440
that are still
in the competition

00:23.440 --> 00:24.900
to try to take our spots.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.152
I think Latrice
is gonna pick me.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.196
You think so?

00:29.196 --> 00:31.031
Monique
might have won the battle,

00:31.031 --> 00:32.741
but I'm going to win the war.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.494
- [laughs]
- Aah!

00:35.494 --> 00:36.578
[gasps]

00:36.578 --> 00:39.831
Oh!

00:39.831 --> 00:41.917
Oh-ho! [laughs]

00:41.917 --> 00:43.043
This is the gay Super Bowl.

00:44.962 --> 00:51.718
Jasmine, my beautiful Farrah,
Gia Gunn, sashay away.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.929
Latrice Royale,

00:53.929 --> 00:55.222
shantay, you stay.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.394
Monique Heart,

01:00.394 --> 01:03.605
shantay, you stay.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.815
[cheers and applause]

01:07.901 --> 01:09.695
Come on, girl.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.779
Aah!

01:10.779 --> 01:13.991
Girl, cocktails.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.244
Baby, it feels amazing
to be back.

01:17.244 --> 01:21.248
Even though Ru saved Monique,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.083
my point was made.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.752
I got revenge, redemption,

01:25.752 --> 01:30.507
and this time around,
ain't no child's play.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.759
I came here to step my pussy up,

01:32.759 --> 01:34.553
and I want my crown.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.930
Listen, I know we should all
have a big old toast.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.058
Bitch, that motherfucking
lip syncing was everything.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.435
[cheers]

01:41.435 --> 01:43.770
The five of y'all
fucking turned it, girl.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.689
Like, gag.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.734
What I wanna know, bitch,
is how does it feel

01:48.734 --> 01:51.862
for both of you whores
to get to stay?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.322
I'm all about it,

01:53.322 --> 01:55.949
because I know this ho
was gonna fight for her life,

01:55.949 --> 01:59.578
and she wasn't
goin' nowhere, bitch.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.289
And then you, being like
I don't give a fuck

02:02.289 --> 02:03.707
if it's
a motherfucking Latrice,

02:03.707 --> 02:05.417
I'm gonna do the reveal
upon the reveal upon the reveal

02:05.417 --> 02:07.627
and give it my all.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.087
Girl, this was herstory.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.632
So Latrice is back.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
I guess she got
her redemption moment.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.060
Cute.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.145
I am mo-ti-vated,

02:25.145 --> 02:28.315
and every single thing
that I do from here out

02:28.315 --> 02:30.859
I'm attacking it
with everything I have,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.362
because I'm not goin' nowhere,
no how.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.863
Okay, thank you,
Latrice Royale.

02:34.863 --> 02:35.864
Sorry, I'm fierce, too.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.532
- I'm here to stay.
- [laughs]

02:37.532 --> 02:39.368
I'm going to win
this entire competition.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.079
And being that
there was two girls

02:42.079 --> 02:44.331
that were ready
to send me home last week--

02:44.331 --> 02:46.750
Oh, wait, do you have
some feelings about that?

02:46.750 --> 02:49.461
Sending me home doesn't
make sense with my fantasy.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.048
- [all laugh]
- Like it doesn't, it doesn't...

02:53.048 --> 02:54.633
Her fantasy.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.385
She could stay home
and just have the fantasy.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.720
- [all laugh]
- Oh, yeah.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.849
I am now at a point
where people don't want me here.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.435
Two lipsticks were mine.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.854
I'm angry at the situation.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.897
I'm still fighting, though.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.400
I'm not giving up.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.194
So "All Stars" rules
are back in session.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.028
That means you gotta
step your pussy up.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.279
That's it.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.281
Your pussy
gotta be fresh and tight

03:18.281 --> 03:19.825
- and you gotta look right.
- I'm fresh.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.826
Hello?

03:20.826 --> 03:23.161
Just means
that no one here...

03:23.161 --> 03:24.329
- Is safe.
- Is safe.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.873
- Except for Manila and Monét.
- No.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.959
Bitch, you're drinking
a cocktail, honey.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.293
That time has passed.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.753
Take that girdle off.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.297
It's cutting off the air supply,
bitch, okay?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.174
[laughs]
This is exhausting.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.635
We are back at seven girls.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.097
I think we all are good
contenders for the crown.

03:42.097 --> 03:46.268
So now it's time to really start
to separate from the pack.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.187
Ooh, I get to move back
in my apartment. Yay!

03:49.187 --> 03:53.942
But Latrice definitely
has a tricky game ahead of her.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.986
If you are eliminated
and you come back,

03:55.986 --> 03:59.865
bitch, you need to be at the top
every single week.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.617
Any time that she slips
or stumbles or falls,

04:02.617 --> 04:06.371
I think it'll be justification
to send her home.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.329
We have more queens
than we're supposed to have,

04:47.329 --> 04:50.373
but I don't care, because
my girl Latrice is back.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.918
Valentina, no thank you.
We don't accept that.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.674
Latrice motherfucking Royale
is back in the house.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.928
But there's been a herstory
of girls who come back,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.638
and they go right back home.

05:04.638 --> 05:08.099
So I need to slay
this challenge.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.352
I can't come back
and then be sent home.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.646
Yeah, no, what the hell is that?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.356
There's definitely
more twists coming.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.357
- Always.
- You think so?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.442
Oh, girl.
[alarm]

05:17.442 --> 05:19.069
- Here we go.
- See?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.947
She done already
done had herses.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.406
Hey, All Stars.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.284
Night time is the right time.

05:26.284 --> 05:31.248
So if you wanna pop some bottles
to the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

05:31.248 --> 05:34.292
you better walk up
into the club purse first.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.293
- Ahh.
- Oh.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.797
- Bitch, is Bob gonna be here?
- [laughs]

05:38.797 --> 05:40.298
Maybe we're gonna go
to a strip club,

05:40.298 --> 05:41.883
an all-male strip club.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.176
[laughs]

05:43.176 --> 05:44.553
Hello, hello, hello.

05:44.553 --> 05:48.932
- Ooh.
- Look at that. Yeah.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.561
Ladies, now, back in the day
in New York City,

05:52.561 --> 05:57.816
I was discovered by
club impresario Susanne Bartsch,

05:57.816 --> 06:00.694
when she hand-picked me to emcee

06:00.694 --> 06:05.115
at her night at the world-famous
Club Copacabana.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.741
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.909
Now, this was the era

06:07.909 --> 06:10.870
when clubs like Pyramid
and Danceteria

06:10.870 --> 06:13.415
ruled downtown nightlife.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.710
And to this day, drag queens

06:16.710 --> 06:20.213
have kept the nightlife scene
alive around the globe.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.173
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

06:22.173 --> 06:23.842
working in teams,

06:23.842 --> 06:29.014
you'll create and host
your own legendary club night.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.058
Oh.
[applause]

06:32.058 --> 06:33.768
I feel like
this is gonna be fun.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.770
I grew up in the club, girl,

06:35.770 --> 06:38.440
sneaking into the club
at 12, 13 years old

06:38.440 --> 06:39.858
without my parents' knowledge.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.318
So I know a good club,

06:41.318 --> 06:43.153
and I think I can shine
in this challenge.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.573
Each team is responsible
for every detail,

06:46.573 --> 06:49.993
from the name, to the décor,

06:49.993 --> 06:53.496
the entertainment,
down to the signature cocktail.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.206
- Wow.
- Ooh.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.083
And don't forget
to put Michelle Visage

06:57.083 --> 06:59.878
and Carson Kressley
on your VIP list.

06:59.878 --> 07:04.132
Plus our extra-special
guest judges,

07:04.132 --> 07:07.427
singer, actress, and TV host
Rita Ora will be here.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.471
[cheers and applause]

07:09.471 --> 07:11.556
And the queen of clubs
herself,

07:11.556 --> 07:14.392
Susanne Bartsch will be here.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.354
[cheers and applause]
And at the break of dawn,

07:17.354 --> 07:20.440
the queens who've created
the most iconic,

07:20.440 --> 07:23.318
unforgettable club experience

07:23.318 --> 07:24.903

07:26.154 --> 07:28.281

07:28.281 --> 07:29.616
Now, to help
with your club décor,

07:29.616 --> 07:33.286
you can use materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.496
- Lovely.
- Yeah. Okay.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.415
Now, as a welcome-back gift,

07:37.415 --> 07:40.877
Latrice Royale, you get
to pair up the queens

07:40.877 --> 07:42.879
and then join
the team of your choice.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.715
All right, Latrice,

07:45.715 --> 07:47.133
who are you pairing up first?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.220
Uh...

07:50.220 --> 07:53.181
Monét and Monique.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.516
Excuse me, Trinity.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.476
[all laugh]

07:56.476 --> 07:59.354
And then we'll have Trinity...

07:59.354 --> 08:04.567
with Manila.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.403
- Cool.
- All right, yeah.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.948
Which means Valentina
is paired with Naomi.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.408
Yay.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.703
So Latrice, which pair
will you be joining?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.374
We worked so well last time.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.875
[all laugh]

08:20.875 --> 08:23.753
I'm going to go
with Manila and Trinity.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.047
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.507
Very wise.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.426
[all laugh]

08:29.426 --> 08:31.052
All right, party girls.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.512
Start your engines,

08:32.512 --> 08:35.432
and may the best All Star win.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.768
[cheers and applause]

08:41.896 --> 08:43.022
You ready to make a club?

08:43.022 --> 08:44.858
Yeah, girl, I'm so excited.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.237
This week, we get to design
our own legendary club night.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.573
I'm paired with Naomi Smalls.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.575
This is gonna be
the perfect match.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.953
We're both young, we're both
fashion, we're both fun.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.163
Well, is she fun?

08:58.163 --> 09:01.499
You're glam, I'm glam.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.295
They're old, we're young.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.923
You're skinny, I'm sometimes
skinny when I want to,

09:08.923 --> 09:12.010
when I'm not drinking too many
French vanilla fantasies.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.928
[slurps]

09:13.928 --> 09:15.472
Ahh.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.183
What if the theme
is being a model?

09:18.183 --> 09:21.186
Club Diva, where you can be
queen for the night.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.021
Divas. Divas.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.106
Because you, too,
should feel like a queen.

09:25.106 --> 09:29.235
There are so many aspects
of this challenge.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.447
Is this a design challenge,
is it a comedy challenge,

09:32.447 --> 09:34.991
is it a promoter challenge,
or is it a host challenge?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.785
It's all of it.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.788
The way my mind is going
and the way that I'm feeling,

09:39.788 --> 09:41.956
it's too many things at once.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.458
Our décor.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.668
Let's keep it
really fresh and modern.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.464
Fresh, modern, clean.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.466

09:51.466 --> 09:53.009

09:53.009 --> 09:54.761
Ooh, I like that.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.930
Let's have like a nod
to Studio 54.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.557
So 54, we can use a number.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.893
What's the best number to use?

10:01.893 --> 10:02.852
Uh, 69.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.439
69.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.360
Yeah, it could be
a little too expected.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.195
[gasps]

10:12.195 --> 10:14.280
- [laughs]
- Oh, my God.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.573
Let me take a sip
of my French vanilla fantasy.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.743
I just felt the fantasy.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

10:18.743 --> 10:23.623
Valentina lives
in a whole 'nother world

10:23.623 --> 10:26.459
where it's run
by French vanilla fantasy,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.294
champagne, and red M&Ms.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.422
I'm entertained
by all the weirdness.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.925
But the fact that
we've never worked together

10:33.925 --> 10:35.218
is kind of scary,

10:35.218 --> 10:38.221
and I'm not sure
how this is gonna turn out.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.932
Instead of it being Club 69,

10:40.932 --> 10:42.934
where it's like
they're so like horny

10:42.934 --> 10:44.894
that they're like
facing each other,

10:44.894 --> 10:47.897
at this club,
people are so bougie,

10:47.897 --> 10:49.274
they're facing
away from each other.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.650
Club 96.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.818
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's cute.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.862
Like it's still sexual,
but bougie.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.990
- Okay.
- Like...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.908
Okay.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.243
I just hope
we can pull it together,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.787
because I need to win this week.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.455
I really need to win this week.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.665
[slurps]

11:05.665 --> 11:07.584
Club name.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.587
I'm thinking
we should do a spacey thing,

11:10.587 --> 11:12.130
like very, like, new futuristic.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.257
Something like The Black Hole.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.592
The Black Hole, I live.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.801
Where anything goes.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.303
- Yes.
- You know what I mean?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.638
Yes. We're really trying

11:20.638 --> 11:22.974
to think a little bit
outside of the box,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.810
because most of these parties
have done before,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.562
just recycled
in a different fashion.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.898
So how can we do something
and put a spin on it?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.649
So we go with The Black Hole.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.735
Why? Because it's
the mystery, the unknown.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.278
Stunning.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.363
The music's gonna be
out of this world.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.865
You know, very that.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.618
What if we had--what's those
Bill Nye, the Science Guy--

11:41.618 --> 11:43.369
- Oh, like science beakers?
- Science beakers.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.579
That'll be cute, too.
I'm into that.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.957
What if we had an alien baby?

11:47.957 --> 11:49.959
- Oh, my God.
- Area 51.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.461
You can take a picture
of the space baby.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.172
- Slimed.
- Where we getting slime from?

11:54.172 --> 11:57.300
- We can make it.
- [laughs]

11:57.300 --> 11:58.426
So our nightly performance--

11:58.426 --> 12:00.261
wait, space, Men In Black.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.930
Orion's Belt.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.182
Everyone comes
to walk the belt.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.934
Girl.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.518
I'm excited.
I'm really excited now.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.729
[laughs]

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398
Do you guys have any ideas?

12:12.398 --> 12:17.278
Well, I brought a costume
that's yellow and black,

12:17.278 --> 12:19.447
and then I noticed
in your closet

12:19.447 --> 12:20.949
you have a costume
that's yellow and black.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.033
Mm-hmm.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.284
I was thinking
yellow and black,

12:23.284 --> 12:24.619
bumblebees, like a beehive.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.120
Beehive.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.997
I have a fabulous
beehive updo.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.667
See? I mean, it's just--
it's like perfect.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.710
We should have a VIB.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.879
Oh! For Very Important...

12:34.879 --> 12:35.630
- "Beeyotches."
- "Beeyotches."

12:35.630 --> 12:39.676
[all laugh]

12:41.636 --> 12:43.721
So before I was on
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"

12:43.721 --> 12:45.223
hello, worked
as a graphic designer, so...

12:45.223 --> 12:47.934
Hello. I may or may not
have known that.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.938
[all laugh]

12:51.938 --> 12:55.984
So what we need to do is we
need to plan everything evenly

12:55.984 --> 12:58.152
so everybody
has a chance to shine.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.529
But this is
a design challenge,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.406
and this is something
that I can do,

13:01.406 --> 13:04.742
so I'm going to like
outshine you guys in that way.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.204
So do not
fade into the background.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.455
Oh, I'm not--well,
I'm not going to do that.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.748
I mean, we all have something

13:10.748 --> 13:12.166
that we've brought to the table.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.960
Also, we have Latrice Royale
at our club.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.628
You do. You do.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.046
Please, everyone's
gonna show up.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.631
[laughs]

13:18.631 --> 13:23.928
I feel like our team in theory
is a dream team.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.681
You have three
very established entertainers.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.891
Hosting a club night
is what we do.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.769
But Latrice has not done good
in this competition

13:31.769 --> 13:35.773
and went home
in a group challenge.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.150
So I'm a little nervous

13:37.150 --> 13:39.569
that I am going
to have to work extra hard

13:39.569 --> 13:43.614
to pull my weight and then some.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.451
I'm not gonna go home
because of her.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.036
Queen Bee.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.287
- Will you be Queen Bee?
- I will be Queen Bee.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.709
Aah!

13:54.709 --> 13:55.710
- Oh, I love it.
- Whoo.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.420
We have painting clothes.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.714
Awesome. Yes.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.676
We're getting ready to host
our legendary club night.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.803
Showtime realness.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.015
This is like
nine challenges in one.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.517
We have to come up
with a concept,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.145
we have to come up with
the entertainment,

14:14.145 --> 14:16.481
and we have to
decorate this bitch.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.066
And then we actually
have to paint it ourselves.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.442
Wait a minute.
I thought you had a budget.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.943
No? Okay, cute.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.366
- Lovely, guys.
- Valentina looks ridiculous.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.910
Like, bitch,
how you painting in that?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.661
We don't even reach, girl.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.206
We want them to say, damn,
these bitches can paint.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.707
Not just the mug.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.334
Little do y'all know

14:36.334 --> 14:38.336
she asked me if I wanted
to wear the same outfit.

14:38.336 --> 14:42.173
And I was like,
girl, I'm good. [laughs]

14:42.173 --> 14:43.424
I would love to get down,
but...

14:46.552 --> 14:48.721
Girl, does she fit?

14:48.721 --> 14:52.767
[all laugh]

14:52.767 --> 14:56.104
She is fucked.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.231
- Girl, she ain't goin' on.
- No, ma'am.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.983
She ain't goin' on.
She looks--

15:00.983 --> 15:02.318
- Bend your arm.
- Oh, my God.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.820
- Your arm is stuck.
- Way back there?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.614
Oh, hell, no.

15:06.614 --> 15:11.869
Trying to help Latrice
get in this painting smock

15:11.869 --> 15:15.998
is like trying to stuff
a bunch of presents

15:15.998 --> 15:18.626
in a Christmas stocking.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.586
[all laugh]

15:20.586 --> 15:22.255
I can't stand up.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.340
Two pigs rolling around
in a blanket.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.051
Girl, she's breaking
into a full sweat, bitch.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.469
Me and Monique,

15:28.469 --> 15:29.804
we are taking this challenge
seriously.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.389
We are not fucking around

15:31.389 --> 15:34.100
or painting
on somebody's shoulders.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.978
We're not playing with
the little paint-onesie things.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.521
We are getting down to business,

15:38.521 --> 15:41.524
'cause, girl, the bottom line
is one person is going home,

15:41.524 --> 15:43.276
and it shan't be one of us.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.819
How are we
supposed to do this--

15:44.819 --> 15:46.946
Are we supposed--
like which way do you go?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.406
Up and down, girl.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.700
But I've seen people do it
left to right.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.118
That's not the right way.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.412
- Who says?
- Jesus.

16:01.544 --> 16:05.256
Okay, so those'll be like
big hexagon shapes.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.841
- I love it.
- Yeah.

16:06.841 --> 16:10.595
And I think we can probably
go all the way to about here.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.388
So one more row?

16:12.388 --> 16:15.516
Or like half--
like even like a half a row.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.476
You be looking crazy
over there, girl.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.061
- Because I'm like--
- Girl, you on your--

16:19.061 --> 16:20.271
I'm very visual, like.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.899
This is exactly
what you look like.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.859
[laughs]

16:24.859 --> 16:28.487
So this is a really important
challenge for me to excel at.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.324
I have my friend Latrice
back in the game,

16:31.324 --> 16:35.203
and it's very important for me
to make sure that she shines

16:35.203 --> 16:38.748
and that she is back
in this competition for good.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.499
Oh, this is
gonna be pretty, dawg.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.210
Look how that light
coming off of there, though.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.302
Girl, this looks better
than the Mona Lisa.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.055
Maybe we should
honestly just...

16:56.307 --> 16:58.100
Like what?

17:02.188 --> 17:05.233
Aah! My manicure!
Does this come off?

17:05.233 --> 17:08.903
I am stressed because
we have silver walls,

17:08.903 --> 17:10.738
but that's about it.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.531
Like I don't have a script.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.618
I don't have an idea

17:15.618 --> 17:17.620
of why people
are coming to our club.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.705
And I don't have a partner

17:19.705 --> 17:21.666
who's really
helping me figure it out.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.125
What we could make part of skit

17:23.125 --> 17:25.962
is that we took so long
putting this club together,

17:25.962 --> 17:28.464
like we actually painted
these walls ourselves.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.758
Yeah.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.052
It's more than just the look.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.972
We have to entertain, and we
have to have something ready

17:35.972 --> 17:38.516
for the judges to critique.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.892
And if it's just going to be
a silver room,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.687
then my ass is fucked.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.188
You have paint on your face.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.065
Does paint come off of skin?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.985
Fuck!

17:48.985 --> 17:51.612
Okay. [sighs]

17:51.612 --> 17:53.823
I'm just overwhelmed.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.116
Painting is a lot of work.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.951
And then on top of that,

17:56.951 --> 17:58.953
we're being judged
on our hosting abilities,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.579
and I'm an artist.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.332
I'm really trying
to find the inspiration,

18:03.332 --> 18:05.793
so I have to pull it back,
reflect.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.169
It takes time.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.133
Is than an incubator?

18:12.133 --> 18:13.509
Yeah.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.760
For who?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.512
We have a live alien in there.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.097
[gasps]

18:18.097 --> 18:19.932
It's the alien meet-and-greet?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.310
[laughs]
Alien meet-and-greet.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.395
Bitch, I don't want to go
to no motherfucking alien club.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.648
Tacky. Ugly. Eew.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.483
It's very Winnie the Pooh.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.986
Some bee club.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.655
Tacky. Eew. No.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.698
Don't want to be there.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.950
Aah!

18:37.950 --> 18:39.910
My club is gorgeous.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.746
It's stunning.
I believe in it.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.624
And I know that my process
of working was different.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.042
Oh, yeah.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.376
Oh, yeah, that's hot.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.129
But my process
is what makes me a star.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.631
Oh, yes. I live.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.009
I'm gonna be me and we're
gonna be the winning team.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.141
Huh!
[both laugh]

19:03.934 --> 19:05.895
I am so excited

19:05.895 --> 19:10.107
because we're about to debut
our legendary club night,

19:10.107 --> 19:12.068
and, bitch, this is what I do.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.861
I'm a business mogul.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.863
I understand what it takes

19:15.863 --> 19:18.866
to create and have
a successful event.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.243
Honey, Club Hive
is about to bee what?

19:21.243 --> 19:23.287
Off the chizzy, beeyotches.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.830
Yes, sir.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.541
All right.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.628
We gotta do this.
We're gonna turn it out.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.588
- We--I'm so excited.
- Yeah.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.633
Honestly, what I want to do,
makeup on,

19:35.633 --> 19:40.179
get to work, work on
my everything, get it.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.640
Mm-hmm.
Get your character down.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.266
- Oh...ah...
- Yeah.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.689
Susanne Bartsch.
Oh, my God.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.150
The mother of parties.
You know what I'm saying?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.777
Like this bitch
is gonna be at our club.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.028
That's awesome.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.196
The judges
are literally integrated

19:57.196 --> 19:58.948
- into our fucking game.
- Yeah.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.116
So if they don't have
a good time, bitch,

20:00.116 --> 20:03.494
they're like,
what was this shit?

20:03.494 --> 20:05.788
- Hey, Monique, Monét.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.790
Y'all have done a lot
of challenges together.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.417
How's that feel?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.168
Monique and I have
a familiarity with each other,

20:11.168 --> 20:14.004
which makes it easier to finish
each other's sandwiches,

20:14.004 --> 20:15.131
you know what I'm saying?

20:15.131 --> 20:16.590
That's nice.
That's real nice.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.134
One's always at the top,
one's at the bottom,

20:18.134 --> 20:19.593
so let's see
how this one pans out.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.886
Henny.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.306
Working with Valentina
was great.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.393
[laughs]

20:27.393 --> 20:29.145
Girl.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.771
I know I'm a lot.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.398
It's like a privilege,
but like a curse.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.775
- Oh!
- I feel like we definitely have

20:34.775 --> 20:37.069
different ways
about going about things.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.279
So that means
if you're in the bottom,

20:38.279 --> 20:38.946
you're throwing her
under the bus.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.489
No, not at all.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.283
We both have different ways
of going about it.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.161
I was kind of more in the sense
of like let's get it done.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.579
Like, let's make it happen.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.332
But I found myself
doing a lot of the work.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.210
She pretty much took over
and took charge.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.795
Like she was the dominant one,
for sure.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.464
Oh, so, okay.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.966
- But I wouldn't say by choice.
- Oh.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.594
[laughs]

21:01.594 --> 21:03.512
I just work so differently
as an artist,

21:03.512 --> 21:05.848
but now we've gotten to a point

21:05.848 --> 21:08.476
where we both believe
in what we've worked on.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.895
It's both of our idea,
and it reflects both of us.

21:10.895 --> 21:16.066
But, yes, Naomi did do
if not all, most of the writing.

21:16.066 --> 21:19.320
Thank you, Naomi, because
you really got us to a place

21:19.320 --> 21:21.947
where now we're
fucking fierce, bitch.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.824
Latrice, girl, how you feeling
over there, mama?

21:23.824 --> 21:27.536
Baby, I feel like a winner.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.621
Amen.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.247
Like, I really do.
I feel good.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.249
I'm wearing my favorite thing
for the runway.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.751
- Word.
- Oh, my God.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.252
I feel really excited.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.171
It's really awesome,

21:37.171 --> 21:39.715
because everybody's just like
showcasing their strengths.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.883
This is what we do.

21:40.883 --> 21:44.595
Latrice is a force
to be reckoned with,

21:44.595 --> 21:47.932
and she has a humongous
following of fans

21:47.932 --> 21:49.767
that love and adore her.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.728
But in this competition,
I just don't feel like

21:52.728 --> 21:56.315
she's like living up
to what she is capable of.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.151
This could be her last chance.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.945
You a big-ass bitch.

22:00.945 --> 22:04.114
Make it known, honey.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.282
So it's official.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.493
Everyone has officially
been in the bottom here.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.371
Manila hasn't been bottom two.
She's the only one.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.122
You've never been up
for elimination.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.374
And I hope
to keep it that way.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.209
Okay. [laughs]

22:15.209 --> 22:19.171
How are people feeling about
the process of elimination?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.381
I don't know.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.966
My stance hasn't changed.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.968
I want to beat the best,

22:23.968 --> 22:26.387
so who I think
is the strongest competition

22:26.387 --> 22:28.097
is who I would want to stay.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.848
Thanks, Trinity.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.977
[all laugh]

22:32.977 --> 22:36.438
It's time
for Drag Race After Dark,

22:36.438 --> 22:38.649
where you've got VIP access

22:38.649 --> 22:41.652
to the hottest clubs
from Tokyo to Tuckahoe.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.989
Tonight, a tour
of New York's queen of scenes,

22:44.989 --> 22:47.449
with extra-special party guests
Michelle Visage,

22:47.449 --> 22:51.579
Carson Kressley, Rita Ora,
and club queen Susanne Bartsch.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.163
Let's go.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.834
First, let's get lost
in The Black Hole

22:56.834 --> 22:58.877
with Monét X Change
and Monique Heart.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.387
Hello, world.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.097
Hello, America.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.640
- My name is Monique Heart.
- And I'm Monét X Change.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.018
And welcome to The Black Hole.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.312
When you think
of a black hole,

23:16.312 --> 23:18.105
no one knows what's there.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.440
So we wanted to do a party

23:19.440 --> 23:22.151
that really personifies
the mystery, the unexpected.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.528
The design and the aesthetic,
very space,

23:24.528 --> 23:27.323
very intergalactic
and futuristic.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.908
Wanted to align the walls with
stars and galaxies and planets.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.285
You know what I mean?

23:31.285 --> 23:33.454
We have Saturn, we have Pluto,
and we have Her-anus.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.830
I thought it was yours.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.165
- No, yours, bitch.
- Okay.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.376
Well, I saw yours last week
at The Black Hole, girl.

23:39.376 --> 23:42.630
This is a live alien baby
in an incubator.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.424
I mean, you can actually
put your hands in and touch.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.343
- Aah!
- [laughs]

23:47.343 --> 23:48.802
Why would you do that to me?

23:48.802 --> 23:51.138
I thought it was going
to bite my damn hand off.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.851
So this is
our hot bartender, Scotty.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.979
He has curated two fabulous
drinks called Beam Me Up.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.147
Yes.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.899
Scotty, can I get
two Beam Me Ups, please?

24:01.899 --> 24:04.777
They're made
of space oohs and space ohs,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.445
you know, for all those
space hos out there.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.197
- Yeah.
- Clink.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.073
Girl, we gonna be wasted by
the time this tour is over.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.075
Cheers.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.910
Hey, hey.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.078
You look incredible.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.496
Loving it. Loving it.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.414
You dressed for our party.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.791
Last month,
we had Dennis Rodman

24:18.791 --> 24:20.209
and Bubbles the Chimpanzee.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.585
It was a good time.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.754
Didn't the month before that
we had Courtney Love.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.047
Girl, teaching us
how to line dance.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.924
You know what I mean?
That is The Black Hole.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.301
The unexpected
is gonna happen every time,

24:29.301 --> 24:30.386
and you can bet
your bottom dollar.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.430
That is the T, girl.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.890
All right, Black Hole,

24:34.890 --> 24:37.309
are you ready
to have a good time tonight?

24:37.309 --> 24:39.269
[cheers and applause]
All right.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.646
Do we have any volunteers

24:40.646 --> 24:43.399
who want to turn a look
and walk the--ooh.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.026
Tonight at midnight
the show goes down.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.445
[cheers]

24:48.445 --> 24:50.823
You come in a look,
you turn the look,

24:50.823 --> 24:52.783
you get to walk the belt,
and you get to win a prize.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.535
Yes! [laughs]

24:54.535 --> 24:57.246
I think we're supposed
to get married now.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.248
Kak katty-kak-ka.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.792
Ah-ha-ah-ah, ahh.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.127
There are three different
cash prizes, and--

25:03.127 --> 25:04.128
How much are the prizes?

25:04.128 --> 25:05.170
- $1.000.
- Uh-huh.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.296
- $100.
- Uh-huh.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.923
Or a buck-25, okay?

25:07.923 --> 25:09.383
Because we want to make sure
you can get home.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.218
You know, I mean,
you can't get a transfer,

25:11.218 --> 25:12.511
but you can at least
get on the bus.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.221
- Amen, girl.
- Aah!

25:14.221 --> 25:16.974
- $100.
- $100!

25:16.974 --> 25:18.976
Yes, yes!

25:18.976 --> 25:20.728
Listen, if you are
looking for a club

25:20.728 --> 25:22.020
that is gonna give you
the unexpected,

25:22.020 --> 25:23.063
something
that is gonna give you

25:23.063 --> 25:24.565
a weekend that
you will never forget...

25:24.565 --> 25:25.816
And it's the only place
in the world

25:25.816 --> 25:27.609
where you can have a space alien

25:27.609 --> 25:30.487
probe that little booty
of all y'all's.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.947
So, please, come on out
to The Black Hole

25:31.947 --> 25:34.616
and have a kiki with
your girls Monét and Monique.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.034
Yes. Let all the aliens
say what?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.244
Amen.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.287
- Amen.
- Yeah!

25:38.287 --> 25:40.330
- Brrrrrr...

25:40.330 --> 25:43.167
- Yeah, Susanne, uh, uh.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.918
- Yeah!

25:44.918 --> 25:48.630
- Next, let's get glam,
slam, thank you, ma'am

25:48.630 --> 25:51.925

and Valentina.

26:00.100 --> 26:04.396
- Welcome to Club 96,

26:14.907 --> 26:16.658
And I'm Vivi.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.869
We're tall, we're skinny,

26:18.869 --> 26:20.329
and we're high fashion

26:20.329 --> 26:23.582

26:23.582 --> 26:25.042

26:27.461 --> 26:29.087
- Why?
- Why Club 96?

26:29.087 --> 26:32.382
1996, girl,
amazing time for fashion.

26:32.382 --> 26:35.219
Pastels shown in fall.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.221
Paco Rabanne custom couture.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.514
They're not just a work of art.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.474
They're
a mathematical equation.

26:40.474 --> 26:43.644
Isaac Mizrahi

26:43.644 --> 26:45.312

26:49.358 --> 26:52.736
Come here and rest your feet
in your designer shoes.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.112
Show off your tan.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.948
Let's drink some booze.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.116
[whispers] Club 96.

26:58.116 --> 27:03.288
Our signature drink
is super long, super tall.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.374
It has lots of champagne.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.544
And may we not forget
our favorite piece of garnish.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.631
A red N&N just for color.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.843
The ridiculous
rider refresher.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.302
Cheers to that.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.971
[whispers] Club 96.

27:23.851 --> 27:27.312
Here we have our VIP area,

27:48.917 --> 27:50.335
- [gasps]
- Is it 2 A.M.?

27:50.335 --> 27:51.587
It's 2 A.M.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.088
Girl, our contest
is about to start.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.882
Aah!

27:54.882 --> 27:56.174
You wanna know
what it's called?

27:56.174 --> 27:58.677
- Sell Me The Garment.
- Sell That Garment.

28:00.888 --> 28:04.141
We are going to take
fashion roadkill at this point,

28:04.141 --> 28:06.393
and you're going to sell it
to us, okay?

28:06.393 --> 28:09.730
Make last week's bargain
look like this week's splurge.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.648
Here's Farrah Moan's leftovers.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.192
And category is accessories.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.615
[dance music plays]
Give us a pose.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.491
Make me believe it.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.327
You have to pose it out.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.495
Sell it down the runway.
Make us want it.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.956
I want it, I want it.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.792
Give it to us, honey.
Give us couture.

28:30.792 --> 28:34.004
One of a kind.
Put it on your body. Yes.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.632
- Whoo-hoo!
- I think it's clear.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.091
We know who the winner is.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.302
Drum roll please, everybody.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.762
- Brrrr...
- Brrrr...

28:41.762 --> 28:43.138
And the winner is...

28:43.138 --> 28:46.016
- Both of them.
- Both of them.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.726
[cheers and applause]

28:47.726 --> 28:49.603
We've been hosting the
party gigs now for three hours,

28:49.603 --> 28:51.355
and we're over it.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.149
Why don't we end this day
with a cocktail, everybody?

28:54.149 --> 29:00.072
Bring it high, bring it low,

Oh, honey.

I'm your girl, Latrice Royale,

29:26.014 --> 29:28.892
and welcome to Club Hive,
darling.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.227
- Yes!
- Yeah!

29:30.227 --> 29:33.480
Yes, this is New York City's
sweetest hot spot.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.315
Come on in and let's see
what all the buzz is about.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.942
[buzzing]

29:36.942 --> 29:39.361
As you see here at Club Hive,

29:39.361 --> 29:43.240
we are a sprawling,
luxurious space

29:43.240 --> 29:44.992
of 20 x 16 feet.

29:44.992 --> 29:48.245
A lovely area
for our community to dwell,

29:48.245 --> 29:50.956
feel their fantasy,
and just bee, honey.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.708
Isn't it the bee's knees?

29:52.708 --> 29:54.501
It's all the buzz.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.713
Here at Club Hive,
the bee puns just never end.

It just drives you crazy.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.342

30:03.927 --> 30:07.639
This is our signature cocktail
called the Bee-tini.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.933
It's made with
honey-infused vodka.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.477
It's got a little bit
of hornet venom,

30:12.477 --> 30:16.523
and it's in a martini glass
rimmed with bee pollen.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.691
It's her favorite.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.277
Latrice Royale's
actually only 120 pounds.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.903
She's just really,
really allergic to bees.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.697
She loves it, and so will you.

- Not everybody.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.457

Can you use it in a sentence?

31:46.071 --> 31:47.948
Sure I can.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.991
After you leave this evening
with Carson,

31:49.991 --> 31:51.785
you're going to need
to go to the clinic tomorrow

31:51.785 --> 31:53.662

You created an experience,

37:13.898 --> 37:16.317
that you just oozed confidence,
and it was fun.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.236
I ended up loving your club

37:18.236 --> 37:20.780
because of

- This look is bananas.
- What?

37:38.965 --> 37:41.885
And apples and grapes
and maybe a nectarine.

37:41.885 --> 37:45.013
It's beautiful, but it has
a real sense of fun.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.600
I think this is who you are,
Manila.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.687

most of the time it's a hit.

As far as the beehive goes,

37:55.607 --> 37:56.900

illusion lounge redone.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.281
I felt like I was in a beehive.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.534
The thing that I didn't love
is that you're funny,

38:06.534 --> 38:08.161
and you always have
something to say,

38:08.161 --> 38:10.330
but sometimes you tend to get
louder to get over people.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.581
You don't have to do that.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.374
It's okay
to let the room breathe.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.169
and that's okay.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.545
So just be aware of that.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.713
Maybe give the other two

38:18.713 --> 38:19.964
a little bit of a moment
sometimes.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.257
Oh, sure.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.550
Maybe later.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.843
Maybe after I send them home.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.887
Trinity The Tuck.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.472
Yes, ma'am.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.433
Your interpretation
of plastique fantastique is fun.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.810
It literally looks like
you were riding on a motorcycle

38:32.810 --> 38:33.978
and somebody spit their gum
out the window

38:33.978 --> 38:35.980
and it got smashed on you.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.024
[all laugh]

38:38.024 --> 38:39.067
You've done
something different

38:39.067 --> 38:40.610
with your face tonight,
and your hair,

38:40.610 --> 38:42.946
it's got
this monochromatic effect

38:42.946 --> 38:45.156
that is really different
for you.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.451
Again, elevating and changing
and keeping us on our feet.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.452
Thank you.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.371
Let's talk about
your bee-havior.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.414
[all laugh]
You're very commanding.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.084
You obviously host
a lot of club gigs.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.586
The whole spelling bee thing,
that was really funny.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.798
You have a really unique talent
of being shady in a good way,

39:01.798 --> 39:04.509
but you're also
really warm and welcoming.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.094
It's just called
being country.

39:06.094 --> 39:09.264
I like it.
You really put the...in country.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.516
[all laugh]

39:11.516 --> 39:13.309
I was also very impressed
with your emceeing.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.686
I would hire you.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.563
I felt engaged,
and I wanted more.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.440
- Thank you.
- Now release the bees.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.402
[all laugh]

39:22.402 --> 39:24.654
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

39:24.654 --> 39:27.073
Tonight on the runway,
the dress style

39:27.073 --> 39:28.950
I feel like I've seen on you
a few times.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.035
But what I liked a lot about it

39:31.035 --> 39:34.581
is the contradictions
in the palette of the colors.

39:34.581 --> 39:37.625
I really love that
you know what you have,

39:37.625 --> 39:39.002
and you work with it.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.837
Honey, your legs
are just stunning.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.589
At the end of the day,
I got those.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.758
You know, you can get
those babies insured.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.928
Let's talk about...
[whispers] Club 96.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.263
[whispers] Club 96.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.181
I like that you chose
the 1990s,

39:52.181 --> 39:54.934
which was kind of, you know,
the heyday of the supermodel.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.353
I thought your look was spot on.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.647
I loved the Club 96
over and over again.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.483
I think that was kind of like
an SNL kind of skit.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.319
But I was looking for more.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.696
Yeah, I walked into the space,

40:06.696 --> 40:09.157
and I see a disco ball
and a go-go box.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.783
I'm like in heaven.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.535
I'm like that's going to be
the club I love.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.454
But then it got going,

40:14.454 --> 40:16.831
to me it was a little bit
one-dimensional.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.124
I wasn't engaged.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.293
It was all about
how gorgeous you are,

40:20.293 --> 40:22.211
and then what? So...

40:22.211 --> 40:25.381
I don't know how much time
and thought you put into it,

40:25.381 --> 40:28.134
how much you memorized
versus how much you improv'd.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.261
I think
it just needed to be more.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.306
Up next, Valentina.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.308
First, I wanted to ask you

40:35.308 --> 40:37.685
why you chose to do
your Snatch Game character

40:37.685 --> 40:39.270
as your plastic character.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.396
Weren't you Miss Venezuela?

40:40.396 --> 40:42.190
No, I was Miss Colombia.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.901
[all laugh]

40:44.901 --> 40:47.236
So it's the same crown,
correct?

40:47.236 --> 40:48.946
No.
[all laugh]

40:50.698 --> 40:52.033
It's so weird.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.159
I've seen that before,
haven't we?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.244
- The Wizard of Oz.
- Maybe that's it.

40:55.244 --> 40:58.373
And you were there
and I was there and Auntie Em.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.374
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.042
So there is no correlation.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.168
There you go.
There's your answer.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.045
[laughs]

41:04.045 --> 41:05.338
I love this look.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.215
I totally get that you look like
you're a Barbie doll

41:07.215 --> 41:09.592
that just maybe busted
through the plastic.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.135
And I love the crotch region.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.971
[all laugh]

41:13.971 --> 41:16.432
Who amongst us
hasn't undressed Barbie or Ken

41:16.432 --> 41:17.934
- looking for genitalia...
- Eew.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.602
only to find
a little plastic nub?

41:19.602 --> 41:21.562
What is wrong with you?
You perv.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.314
I know. I'm sorry,
but it's just I had to say it.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.233
[laughs]

41:25.233 --> 41:27.986
Let's go to Club 96.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.155
The club looked as a design
beautiful.

41:31.155 --> 41:35.368
I also loved the idea
of these kind of two ditzy girls

41:35.368 --> 41:39.163
thinking that they're probably
better than they actually are.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.874
But then it kind of
didn't really go anywhere,

41:41.874 --> 41:44.669
and I started talking
to Susanne and Rita,

41:44.669 --> 41:46.295
and that shouldn't
have happened.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.839
Like I almost felt
like left out.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.841
I don't know if that's
like a rehearsal thing

41:49.841 --> 41:51.634
or if you guys need
to kind of connect more,

41:51.634 --> 41:53.219
but it felt a bit like
you were both battling

41:53.219 --> 41:55.138
instead of like working.

41:56.389 --> 41:59.684
Up next, Monét X Change.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.811
Tonight on the runway,

42:01.811 --> 42:03.312
I think you've
really stepped it up,

42:03.312 --> 42:05.982
and you're giving us more
than you've ever given.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.191
I think you look stunning,

42:07.191 --> 42:08.651
and I think you've elevated

42:08.651 --> 42:10.111
throughout
this entire competition.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.697
Congratulations.
You're slaying the runway game.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.074
Thank you, Carson.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.117
I'm just gonna go to the club.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.994
I had a great time.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.620
Like I felt
so connected to you both.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.165
And like I really loved the fact

42:22.165 --> 42:24.167
that you didn't
overshadow each other.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.461
I didn't want to leave.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.129
So back in my day,

42:28.129 --> 42:31.048
if a club was called
The Black Hole, I was going.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.926
[all laugh]

42:33.926 --> 42:37.472
It almost made like some sense
and then no sense.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.475
Like is it an alien club,
is it an outer space club?

42:40.475 --> 42:41.893
It's a mystery.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.102
Girl, a black hole's
a mystery, Michelle.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.562
We don't know either.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.397
It was stupid fun.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.608
The actual décor,

42:48.608 --> 42:51.360
it went spacey more for me
than black hole.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.737
But you did it well,

42:52.737 --> 42:56.157
and I really loved
the floor shows.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.826
I wanted to get up and be
in the show, invited or not.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.496
I had such a good time
at your club.

43:01.496 --> 43:02.872
It was so much fun.

43:02.872 --> 43:04.791
Like Rita said,
I didn't want to leave.

43:04.791 --> 43:07.668
Up next, Monique Heart.

43:07.668 --> 43:08.753
Tonight on the runway,

43:08.753 --> 43:10.630
I know you're giving us
Josephine Baker,

43:10.630 --> 43:13.049
and I'm getting
No-sephine Baker.

43:13.049 --> 43:16.677
I like your modern version
of a finger wave,

43:16.677 --> 43:18.679
but then something goes south.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.681
Maybe it's the flat bananas.

43:20.681 --> 43:24.227
Overall,
it's not my favorite look.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.604
There's a concept
and there's execution,

43:26.604 --> 43:27.939
and the concept is great.

43:27.939 --> 43:31.150
The execution, not so much.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.319
In The Black Hole,

43:33.319 --> 43:35.655
I loved your look in there
with your grinch fingers

43:35.655 --> 43:37.698
and it was very clubby

43:37.698 --> 43:40.785
and very in keeping with like
a bit ratchet East Village

43:40.785 --> 43:42.286
thrown together kind of feeling.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.164
You knew you were a weirdo,
and you made it work.

43:45.164 --> 43:49.001
And I'm still waiting
for my $100.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.170
[all laugh]
Two weeks. Two weeks.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.089
I will Venmo you
in 2022, girl.

43:53.089 --> 43:54.131
Venmo.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.508
You were being aliens

43:55.508 --> 43:58.553
and you were being so stupid.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.513
And that's why I liked it.

44:00.513 --> 44:03.307
Like that's why
we had fun, you know.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.184
And you were really funny.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.644
Thank you.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.354
All right.
Thank you, ladies.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.981
I think we've heard enough.

44:09.981 --> 44:13.526
Based on the judges' critiques,
I've made some decisions.

44:16.487 --> 44:17.697
Latrice Royale.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.951
Trinity The Tuck.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.079
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
top two All Stars of the week.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.331
[applause]
Oh, my God.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.083
Thank you.

44:29.083 --> 44:32.753
You've each won
a $2.500 gift card

44:32.753 --> 44:34.714
from The Crème Shop,

44:34.714 --> 44:39.969
and a $3.000 gift card
from J.J. Malibu.

44:39.969 --> 44:40.970
Hey.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.473
Manila Luzon.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.102
Monét X Change.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.520
Monique Heart.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.899
You are safe.

44:55.484 --> 44:59.030
That means Naomi Smalls,
Valentina,

44:59.030 --> 45:00.823
you are in the bottom this week.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.077
Latrice, Trinity,

45:05.077 --> 45:07.121
each of you needs to decide

45:07.121 --> 45:09.665
which of the bottom two queens
you'll eliminate

45:09.665 --> 45:13.044
if you win the lip sync.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.422
Ladies, while you deliberate
in the workroom,

45:16.422 --> 45:19.467
the judges and I will be raving

45:19.467 --> 45:21.469
like it's 1993.

45:21.469 --> 45:24.347
[whispers] I was three.

45:24.347 --> 45:25.514
You may leave the stage.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.313
[sighs]

45:32.313 --> 45:34.774
Finally! Aah!

45:34.774 --> 45:37.068
I'm so happy.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.861
Finally in the top.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.529
This means, bitch, game changer.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.073
I'm really here.

45:42.073 --> 45:46.535
But I could not have done it
without my wonderful teammates

45:46.535 --> 45:48.996
Manila Luzon
and Trinity The Tuck.

45:48.996 --> 45:50.831
They got my back
for real, for real.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.292
Congratulations,
Trinity and Latrice.

45:53.292 --> 45:54.961
- Latrice.
- Latrice.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.462
Yeah, girl.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.298
I want to give credit
where credit is due,

45:59.298 --> 46:03.135
and I don't think myself
nor Latrice

46:03.135 --> 46:04.762
would be in the spots
that we're at--

46:04.762 --> 46:06.430
- Without Manila.
- Without Manila's help.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.057
100.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.475
I want to give you
one of my prizes for tonight.

46:09.475 --> 46:11.560
Oh.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.772
You were just as much
of a winner as we are.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.233
- You put in so much work...
- So much.

46:17.233 --> 46:19.902
and deserve
just as much as we got.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.362
Thank you. Thank you.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.364
It was really great
working with you guys.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.200
I'm disappointed
that I'm not in the top two,

46:26.200 --> 46:30.621
but Latrice and Trinity
recognized my hard work,

46:30.621 --> 46:34.625
and I'm happy that I was able to
get my teammates in the top.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.044
I just want to say
before we do this

46:37.044 --> 46:41.257
that I should be really excited
to be in the top,

46:41.257 --> 46:43.551
but I don't feel that way
right now.

46:43.551 --> 46:44.760
I get it.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.345
Like, you don't get it
until you get it, bitch,

46:46.345 --> 46:50.182
and now I am feeling it,
and I do not like this.

46:50.182 --> 46:53.436
I think me and Naomi
did do a great job.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.187
I think we did our very best.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.481
But all I can say
is I'm in the bottom

46:57.481 --> 46:58.899
and nothing's
going to change that.

46:58.899 --> 47:03.029
I have given it all I've got
in this competition,

47:03.029 --> 47:04.780
but I'm in the bottom.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.073
Again.

47:06.073 --> 47:09.410
After having almost
been eliminated.

47:09.410 --> 47:14.707
And I'm now in
a very vulnerable position.

47:14.707 --> 47:16.584
Whoo.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.586
So we can chat.

47:18.586 --> 47:19.795
- Yeah.
- We can chat.

47:19.795 --> 47:20.921
That's what we're here to do.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.798
I don't like it.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.008
So let's go, Vally.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.390
[sighs] Wow.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.934
This is really hard,
because...

47:36.312 --> 47:38.522
I really don't know
where this is gonna go,

47:38.522 --> 47:40.941
because we've seen it
in the competition before.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.193
People get emotional,

47:42.193 --> 47:45.404
and relationship
does come into play.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.448
This is only your second time
in the bottom

47:47.448 --> 47:49.408
compared to her three times
in the bottom.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.826
Though she has a win
and you don't.

47:50.826 --> 47:51.994
Right.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.871
How do you compare the two?

47:53.871 --> 47:57.750
Naomi has been consistent
in the competition.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.043
That's a pro.

47:59.043 --> 48:04.340
Cons: I keep forgetting
about Naomi.

48:04.340 --> 48:08.677
I guess what I would like
to be put into consideration

48:08.677 --> 48:11.472
is how much work
I really put into the project.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.390
What was the percentage
of work that you did

48:13.390 --> 48:15.267
versus the work that she did?

48:15.267 --> 48:19.271
I would say 80% was my doing
and my planning.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.357
I think the biggest difference
is work ethic.

48:23.901 --> 48:26.112
You're not
supposed to be here.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.696
Nope.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.990
I want to be
fighting my way to the top

48:29.990 --> 48:32.451
and seeing myself there
with you.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.703
That was our dream.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.205
This is what we talked about.

48:36.205 --> 48:37.665
It puts a dagger in my heart

48:37.665 --> 48:42.253
because I know how much
you love what you do.

48:42.253 --> 48:43.504
Thank you.

48:43.504 --> 48:46.465
I don't ever want you
to lose that spark

48:46.465 --> 48:48.592
whatever happens.

48:48.592 --> 48:52.680
[sobs]

48:52.680 --> 48:56.225
Oh, my God, Latrice.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.482
Mommy.
Mommy, I'm here. I'm here.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.860
- Look.
- No.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.320
If you show your emotions,
you're not any less.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.158
I'm trying
to keep myself together,

49:12.158 --> 49:16.453
but when you're exhausted
and fatigued, emotions come in.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.874
I have to just push through.

49:19.874 --> 49:26.005
I am so eager
to continue to keep fighting.

49:26.005 --> 49:28.674
Go with your gut now.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.342
I don't know
what my gut is right now.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.136
- Your heart.
- My gut is inside out.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.846
- It's inside out.
- Your heart is different.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.931
Yeah. I love Valentina,

49:35.931 --> 49:40.394
but this competition
has gotten so much more

49:40.394 --> 49:43.272
fierce and demanding,

49:43.272 --> 49:45.524
and I don't know
if she can sustain.

49:45.524 --> 49:48.152
All right, mi amor.

49:48.152 --> 49:51.071
- This is really intense.
- Wild.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.662
[laughs]

50:00.748 --> 50:02.082
You two together,

50:02.082 --> 50:05.961
that's the fucked-up part
that I cannot handle.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.130
I hope that you know
how badly I want to be here.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.383
I know
deep within my loins

50:11.383 --> 50:16.847
how much you want
and deserve to be here.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.058
As far as her track record,

50:19.058 --> 50:22.228
she's been really
consistently safe.

50:22.228 --> 50:24.980
But is safe safe enough?

50:24.980 --> 50:28.442
Like, it wasn't for me.

50:28.442 --> 50:31.570
It makes it hard because
I love Valentina so much,

50:31.570 --> 50:35.324
and we've had talks
and dreams and aspirations

50:35.324 --> 50:37.993
of being all the way
to the end together.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.912
You understand what I'm saying?

50:39.912 --> 50:43.707
I know that I've given 100%
while I've been here,

50:43.707 --> 50:47.294
and if friendship is how we are
going to judge this competition,

50:47.294 --> 50:49.964
then I'm going
to be very disappointed

50:49.964 --> 50:52.675
because I don't have the same
relationship with these girls

50:52.675 --> 50:55.261
that Valentina does.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.012
You are my closest friend
in the competition,

50:57.012 --> 51:01.684
and I want you here more
than I want Naomi here,

51:01.684 --> 51:02.893
because I'm closer to you.

51:02.893 --> 51:06.438
But I also want to be
as fair as possible.

51:06.438 --> 51:08.607
She's saying
she did more work than you.

51:08.607 --> 51:10.234
Is that true?

51:10.234 --> 51:11.694
Like I don't want
to just take her word

51:11.694 --> 51:13.529
and just say okay, girl.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.489
- She did a wonderful job.
- Okay.

51:15.489 --> 51:18.325
But do you think that you
deserve to stay more than her?

51:18.325 --> 51:19.994
Does she deserve
to stay more than you?

51:22.079 --> 51:24.456
[sobs]

51:26.500 --> 51:30.212
I'm emotional, vulnerable.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.381
Those are things I don't show.

51:32.381 --> 51:36.552
How much of the fantasy
can I believe

51:36.552 --> 51:38.595
when reality
is hitting me in the face,

51:38.595 --> 51:43.517
saying, you might be
going home today, girl?

51:43.517 --> 51:45.352
This is a hard decision.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.855
Just do the right thing.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.440
What--you--

51:49.440 --> 51:50.566
Just do the right thing.

51:50.566 --> 51:51.734
Yeah, but what--
give me something

51:51.734 --> 51:53.319
so I can make a better decision.

51:53.319 --> 51:54.778
I deserve to be here.

51:58.490 --> 51:59.992
Whoo!

51:59.992 --> 52:01.785
Has it kicked in yet?

52:01.785 --> 52:03.454
What?

52:03.454 --> 52:05.456
Are you having fun?

52:05.456 --> 52:07.833
I cannot hear you.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.336
I'm having so much fun.

52:10.336 --> 52:12.629
Ooh, I love this song.

52:12.629 --> 52:14.506
Who has a big dong?

52:14.506 --> 52:15.632
Me.

52:15.632 --> 52:17.593
Silence!

52:17.593 --> 52:19.011
What?

52:19.011 --> 52:20.888
Oh, forget about it.

52:20.888 --> 52:22.139
Just party.

52:28.062 --> 52:34.360
I'm having to balance
my integrity and my friendship.

52:34.360 --> 52:39.865
I am looking at these names,

52:39.865 --> 52:43.243
and I'm still trying to
figure out the right choice.

52:43.243 --> 52:47.289
And I just have
to go with my gut.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.505
I did my job
to get back in this competition,

52:54.505 --> 52:59.218
so nothing's going to deter me
from doing what I came to do.

52:59.218 --> 53:00.803
That being said,

53:00.803 --> 53:05.099
the weight and heaviness
that my heart feels

53:05.099 --> 53:09.019
makes it difficult
to send someone home.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.359
[all laugh]

53:15.359 --> 53:16.860
Welcome back, ladies.

53:16.860 --> 53:21.782
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

53:21.782 --> 53:25.244
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

53:25.244 --> 53:29.498
win $10.000,
and earn the power

53:29.498 --> 53:32.376
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

53:35.087 --> 53:37.047
The time has come...
[thunder]

53:37.047 --> 53:39.174
for you to lip sync...

53:39.174 --> 53:43.262
[echoing] for your legacy.

53:45.931 --> 53:47.433
Coming into "All Stars,"

53:47.433 --> 53:52.146
I came here to prove
that I'm not one thing,

53:52.146 --> 53:53.897
and what I'm doing tonight

53:53.897 --> 53:58.527
is just another extension
of who Trinity The Tuck is.

53:58.527 --> 54:03.740

Oh, God.

55:42.422 --> 55:46.051
Ladies, I've made my decision.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.349
Latrice Royale.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.352
You're a winner, baby.

55:55.352 --> 55:59.314

55:59.314 --> 56:01.108
You see this on my shoulders?

56:02.985 --> 56:06.697
I am so proud of me right now.
[laughs]

56:06.697 --> 56:09.866
I am back to show
that I am here to stay

56:09.866 --> 56:11.535
and fight and win this shit.

56:11.535 --> 56:12.786
Con-drag-ulations.

56:12.786 --> 56:16.665
You've earned a cash tip
of $10.000.

56:18.333 --> 56:21.003
I'm going to take
my $10.000 tip

56:21.003 --> 56:23.338
and apply it
to my wedding costs,

56:23.338 --> 56:28.385
because, baby, we are throwing
the bash of the century.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.637
Trinity, you are safe.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.097
You may join the other girls.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.057
Thank you.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.767

56:35.767 --> 56:39.271
Will the bottom two
please step forward.

56:46.820 --> 56:48.488
Latrice Royale,

56:48.488 --> 56:52.784
with great power
comes great responsibility.

56:52.784 --> 56:57.122
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:00.459 --> 57:02.377
I didn't know
it was going to be this--

57:02.377 --> 57:03.837
I didn't know
it was going to be like this.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.048
I didn't know it was
going to be this hard.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.216
If anyone knows how it feels

57:08.216 --> 57:10.886
to feel like your dream has been
stripped from you, it's me.

57:10.886 --> 57:12.429
And thank God
I had the opportunity

57:12.429 --> 57:14.681
to come back and fight.

57:14.681 --> 57:18.477
This person
is a brilliant artist.

57:18.477 --> 57:19.603
I had to choose...

57:21.938 --> 57:22.981
Valentina.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.365
[sobs]

57:35.911 --> 57:39.998
As it is written,
so it shall be done.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.959
My dear Valentina,

57:42.959 --> 57:47.547
you are and will always be
an All Star.

57:47.547 --> 57:52.219
Now sashay away.

57:53.804 --> 57:58.141
[cries]

57:59.726 --> 58:01.228
It's okay.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.522
I love you so much.

58:03.522 --> 58:04.523
I love you, too.
Congratulations.

58:04.523 --> 58:06.942
Thank you guys so much.
Thank you.

58:06.942 --> 58:09.444
[applause]

58:11.154 --> 58:15.117
I'll always remain
your diva with a heart.

58:15.117 --> 58:19.996
But, bitch, let it be known
she left with a crown.

58:19.996 --> 58:23.083
[laughter and applause]

58:25.585 --> 58:29.297
I think
I got caught in my head,

58:29.297 --> 58:34.261
but I've learned that I'm so
fabulous in my own unique way,

58:34.261 --> 58:37.889
and that I don't ever need
to compare myself to anybody.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.892
I might have not won
this competition,

58:40.892 --> 58:44.187
but this experience
is part of my journey

58:44.187 --> 58:46.314
and my story towards becoming
a really big superstar

58:46.314 --> 58:47.733
here on earth.

58:47.733 --> 58:51.027
Honestly, the saddest
and darkest part

58:51.027 --> 58:54.030
is having to pack up
all my shit, girl.

58:54.030 --> 58:57.617
That's gonna be
the hardest part is packing.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.202
It's so much shit.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.997
That's cute.

59:01.997 --> 59:04.249
Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

59:04.249 --> 59:07.169
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:07.169 --> 59:09.713
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:09.713 --> 59:12.007
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:12.007 --> 59:13.008
- Amen!
- Amen!

we are paying tribute
to Judy Garland.

Like what's going, bitch?

59:51.421 --> 59:53.715
Y'all remember "Powder,"
the movie,

59:53.715 --> 59:56.426
the little white boy with no...

59:56.426 --> 59:57.427
Just saying.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.346
Whoa. [rip] Aah!

59:59.346 --> 1:00:00.806
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

1:00:00.806 --> 1:00:02.140
Maybe I should have told him

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:03.475
that he should have trimmed down
there a little bit.

1:00:03.475 --> 1:00:04.601
[rip]
Oh!

1:00:04.601 --> 1:00:06.978
Diagnosis:
sickening, darling.

1:00:06.978 --> 1:00:10.565
I am obsessed
with these looks.

1:00:10.565 --> 1:00:12.692
This one is a little bit
unfulfilling.

1:00:12.692 --> 1:00:13.693
And also
no family resemblance.

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:15.904
It's like distant cousins,
maybe.

1:00:17.489 --> 1:00:19.282
