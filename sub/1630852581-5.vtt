WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:06.240
Tomorrow?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.720
You're certain?

00:08.880 --> 00:11.160
No, you've done well.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.600
It's time I paid a visit to
an old friend.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.960
Must I have a reason to visit?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.920
Well, you've travelled thousands
of miles.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.720
It's not like you're popping in
next-door for a cup of tea.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.800
Oh, charming.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.400
Well, if you don't want me here,
I'll leave.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.160
Well, you mightn't even see
your niece.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.800
We still don't know when
Penelope's due back.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.520
Well, that depends on how long
I stay, doesn't it?

01:37.520 --> 01:39.160
Everything in hand?

01:39.160 --> 01:41.440
Yes. Oh, the flowers.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.320
I'll telephone the florist. Well,
ring them and tell them to hurry.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.480
The Cardinal's going to be here in
less than an hour.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.920
I doubt we'll be excommunicated

01:47.920 --> 01:51.160
for the lack of
a few petunias, Mrs M.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.720
I'm going.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.960
Ah. Don't even think about it.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.960
SNIFFLING

02:09.680 --> 02:11.960
Hercule?

02:11.960 --> 02:15.760
The Camembert is a little ripe.
Sorry. Long journey.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.200
What are you doing here?

02:18.200 --> 02:21.160
I came to say goodbye.
I'm leaving. For New York.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.680
Permanently. I seek a new chapter.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.480
And what is this title of this
chapter?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.520
"Flambeau's Clean Slate"?

02:28.520 --> 02:31.000
You win. I intend to settle down,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.840
grow old,
and lead a blameless life.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.920
You're renouncing crime?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.680
In due course.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.000
Ah.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.640
There's one last treasure
I simply must possess.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.080
Then my collection is complete
and I set sail for a new life.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.800
And this treasure would be?

02:48.800 --> 02:51.120
If I told you that,
it would ruin the surprise.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.360
All I can offer is
a friendly warning.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.320
The road you're on is going down
and down.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.400
And one day you'll find yourself in
a hole from which,

03:04.400 --> 03:06.320
despite your cunning,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.800
you will be unable to escape.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.840
Quit while you are ahead.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.680
Father.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.320
One moment.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.920
Mrs McCarthy is flapping around like
a grouse on the twelfth of August.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.840
Have you been having
a nibble during confession?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.640
Cardinal Ratcliffe has been
appointed Prefect of

03:45.640 --> 03:49.520
the Supreme Tribunal of
the Apostolic Signatura.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.000
I'm not familiar with
Vatican apparatus...

03:52.000 --> 03:53.640
The Prefect's responsible

03:53.640 --> 03:56.480
for justice and discipline within
the Church.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.920
Sounds ominous.
Why come all the way to Kembleford?

03:59.920 --> 04:01.960
I wish I knew.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.200
You didn't tell me he was bringing
a friend.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.160
Do behave.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.640
Welcome to Kembleford,
Your Eminence.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.520
You must be the famous Father Brown.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.120
Your name is whispered in
the corridors of the Palazzo

04:28.120 --> 04:30.800
with unnerving regularity.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.720
There must be many Father Browns in
the church.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.920
Yet, I suspect you're one of a kind.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.960
May I present our parish secretary,
Mrs McCarthy.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.080
Your Eminence.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.360
And...

04:43.360 --> 04:47.120
Lady Felicia Montague.
Patron of St Mary's.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.560
And this is?

04:50.560 --> 04:54.680
Ispettore Angelini of
the Papal Carabinieri.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.680
Your ladyship.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.600
Angelini kindly agreed
to accompany me... for security.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.040
And what brings you
to Kembleford, Your Eminence?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.560
All in good time.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.000
1485.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.640
An unknown thief broke into
the Lateran Treasury

05:22.640 --> 05:25.240
and escaped with one of
the most valuable artefacts in

05:25.240 --> 05:26.880
the history of the Catholic Church.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.200
I am surprised such
a crime is not better known.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.680
It was kept secret.
The Holy See could not appear weak.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.680
What exactly was stolen?

05:35.680 --> 05:39.320
The Tiara of Saint Sylvester,

05:39.320 --> 05:42.120
used in Papal coronations since
the 13th century.

05:43.960 --> 05:49.000
A three-tiered, golden crown
encrusted with sapphires,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.600
emeralds, pearls
and finished with a ruby so large

05:53.600 --> 05:58.640
it made Isabella I of Spain
weep when she saw it.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.680
Father?

05:59.680 --> 06:01.880
Yes?
Are you listening?

06:01.880 --> 06:04.240
Please continue.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.240
Recent correspondence has come
to light suggesting that it was sold

06:08.240 --> 06:11.960
to Sir William Brintley,
a corrupt English nobleman.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.200
Now, Sir William intended
to give the tiara to Richard III...

06:15.200 --> 06:16.880
"Intended"?

06:16.880 --> 06:21.440
Sir William and Richard were both
killed in 1485 at Bosworth Field,

06:21.440 --> 06:23.680
before this devotion could be made.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.840
We believe Sir William hid
the tiara on his estate

06:26.840 --> 06:29.000
before joining the king in battle.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.520
We're aware of your
particular talents.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.440
Find the tiara.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.760
Bring it to me.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.520
It belongs in Rome.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.560
So you intend to steal it?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.680
To return it, Senora,
to its rightful home.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.560
Even if it were at Brintley castle,

06:57.560 --> 07:00.080
it's been lost for nearly
500 years.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.360
The castle has remained in
private hands

07:02.360 --> 07:04.720
and largely untouched.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.920
Wherever the tiara was hidden,

07:06.920 --> 07:09.640
God willing,
perhaps it's still there.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.280
So where exactly do we come in
to all this?

07:13.280 --> 07:18.120
Lady Cecily, the castle's owner,
has seen her fortunes dwindle.

07:18.120 --> 07:22.280
In order to make ends meet,
her plan is to hire the castle out

07:22.280 --> 07:24.040
for special occasions.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.880
How would you like
to help me plan a wedding?

07:56.720 --> 07:58.160
Thank you so much.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.000
Thank you.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.960
One more time?

08:09.960 --> 08:12.840
Patricia Lovelow.
Patty to her friends.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.960
Wealthy widow,
soon to be remarried to Brent Cable,

08:15.960 --> 08:18.400
American steel tycoon.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.320
Are you sure this is a good idea?

08:20.320 --> 08:21.920
I can play a convincing widow.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.440
I simply have to imagine
Monty being trampled by

08:24.440 --> 08:26.960
a herd of elephants, then try not to
look too pleased about it.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.160
Your turn.
I'm only participating

08:29.160 --> 08:31.680
because the request came directly
from the Vatican.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.280
And because you get
to look fabulous in my furs.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.800
Mrs Gwendoline O'Shea.
mother to Patty,

08:39.800 --> 08:43.160
here to ensure that the reception
venue is suitable.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.520
Do I really have to be her mother?

08:46.520 --> 08:49.200
Could I not be her cousin?
Or...or a young aunt?

08:49.200 --> 08:51.520
Too late.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.040
Welcome to Brintley Castle,
Mrs Lovelow.

08:54.040 --> 08:58.600
Thank you. May I introduce my dear
old mother, Mrs O'Shea?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.600
No, no, please call me Gwendoline.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.880
And our friend Father Brown.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.680
I do hope you're
going to like our humble abode.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.280
A wedding reception is just what
the old girl needs

09:10.280 --> 09:11.520
to bring her back to life.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.800
Oh, it is far lovelier than
I had imagined.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.240
Oh, come.
Let me give you the grand tour.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.760
What about our...?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.040
Right.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.480
Apologies for the lack of staff.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.680
I've rather got used to fending
for myself.

09:37.680 --> 09:42.320
Obviously, for the big day,
we'll have a full team.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.880
I remember when my Neville
proposed to me.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.960
He took me on a Champagne picnic.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.320
Off to fight in South Africa,
you see.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.640
Wanting to tie up the loose ends.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.040
I told him, "Yes, so long as you
don't get shot."

09:57.040 --> 10:01.080
Sadly, he was never very good at
following orders.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.560
My condolences.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.720
Ancient history, Father.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.240
I'm sorry that on this occasion you
won't get to meet the groom.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.560
Sadly, Brent has been detained in
America on business.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.480
That's what you think.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.280
Sorry?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.240
Who says romance is dead.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.760
Mr Cable.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.280
Surprise.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.440
He cut short his business trip just
so he could be with you.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.840
Darling. I've missed you.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.920
I know I should be sealing
the big deal,

10:40.920 --> 10:43.600
but every second with you is worth
a million bucks in the bank.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.640
But I...

10:54.040 --> 10:57.680
Mrs O'Shea,
you're in the Evesham Suite.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.360
Ooh.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.800
Father Brown, you're in Warwick.

11:03.800 --> 11:07.680
And the happy couple are in
the Royal Suite.

11:11.320 --> 11:15.400
I was a little surprised they're
already sharing quarters,

11:15.400 --> 11:18.960
but I understand things are
different across the pond.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.320
You're too kind. And may I say what
a swell place you have here.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.480
He's certainly a charmer.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.600
I'll leave you to freshen up
before supper.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.400
How DARE you?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.920
Is a man not allowed
to kiss his fiancee?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.160
What're you doing here?
The same as us.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.360
The tiara. Of course.
Don't even think about denying it.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.080
And you can wipe that smug smile off
your face

11:45.080 --> 11:48.680
because I am going downstairs now
to telephone the police.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.920
And blow your cover?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.800
I've a better idea.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.840
Let's work together to find
the tiara.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.040
I'll keep the ruby on top.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.920
Everything else is returned to the
Vatican.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.520
Are you seriously suggesting
stripping a holy relic for parts?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.920
You need my help.
I have an array of valuable skills.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.680
These hands can work miracles.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.360
And don't forget, the tiara has been
hidden for half a millennium.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.080
And it would do well to remain
hidden for another half,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.800
rather than you get your filthy,
thieving mitts on it.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.160
Father, these mean girls won't let
me join in their game.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.040
Tell them they must share.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.760
Lady Felicia is right.
The tiara is sacred.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.640
Go, or we will alert
the authorities.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.600
But don't forget I've travelled
from America

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
to see my beautiful fiance.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.760
If I leave so soon,
Lady Cecily will get suspicious.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.440
How about I stay the night,

12:31.440 --> 12:34.600
then tomorrow morning say I've been
called away on urgent business?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.200
I'll be gone before breakfast.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.400
I suppose.
Father.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.040
Excellent. I believe we're in here,
sugar-plum.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.920
You must be tired after your
long journey.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.600
I know I am.
How about I run us a bath?

12:52.160 --> 12:54.960
She's saving herself
for our wedding night.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.400
I guess this means I'm bunking
with you, Father.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.840
Eight years ago we were producing
72%

13:04.840 --> 13:06.240
of the world's steel.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.480
Now we're losing share to Japan,
India...

13:08.480 --> 13:10.600
Darling, let's not discuss business
over dinner.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.760
Not that it's much of a dinner.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.360
Sorry. Still learning this etiquette
you Brits love so much.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.040
That's quite all right, Mr Cable.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.960
Tell me, how did you two meet?

13:23.480 --> 13:28.000
I...I was waiting outside
a railway station,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
trying to get home.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.200
He offered me a lift.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.360
Couldn't leave a lady stranded?

13:34.360 --> 13:36.880
In return, she invited me to
an art exhibition.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.880
An eventful evening, as I recall.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.960
And the rest is history.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.280
I nearly forgot.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.600
I have something for you, my love.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.280
It's my necklace.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.080
It belonged to her father.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.640
The family were forced
to sell it at auction.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.320
Luckily,
I know the collector who bought it.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.000
How very considerate of you.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.240
CECILY: You've got a good one there,
dear.

14:16.240 --> 14:21.320
FATHER: Lady Cecily, I'm very keen
to know about the castle's history.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.080
CECILY: It's all in the archives.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.320
In the library,

14:24.320 --> 14:28.200
we have documents going back
to Sir William Brintley himself.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.960
Fascinating.
Why don't we look together?

14:31.960 --> 14:34.360
Tomorrow morning, after breakfast?

14:34.360 --> 14:37.880
But, Mr Cable, did you not say you
had to leave before first light?

14:37.880 --> 14:39.520
So soon?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.960
I'm sure an extra hour or two
wouldn't hurt.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.800
Do you have to smoke in bed?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.440
It helps me relax.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.160
You returned Lady Felicia's
necklace. Why?

15:17.160 --> 15:20.600
I found it lying about.
It's not to my taste.

15:20.600 --> 15:26.320
Seemed uncharacteristically
selfless.

15:26.320 --> 15:31.040
I told you, Father, I'm on the path
of redemption.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.160
By the way, where's the Cardinal

15:33.160 --> 15:35.760
while you're here doing his dirty
work?

15:35.760 --> 15:39.840
In a hotel in Brintley.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.240
Think you'll find it?

15:48.880 --> 15:51.000
The tiara?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.760
Sir William Brintley's will.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.440
Isn't that why you were fishing
for a peek at the family archives?

15:56.440 --> 15:59.360
You believe he left a clue to
the tiara's hiding-place.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.800
Goodnight, Hercule.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.200
CLATTERING

16:38.640 --> 16:41.280
Bout of insomnia.
Thought I'd stretch my legs.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.720
You're off to look for the tiara,
aren't you?

16:44.720 --> 16:47.280
You couldn't resist the temptation.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.880
You can hardly blame me.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.320
Stealing things is always more fun
with you around.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.960
I get to watch you pretend you're
not enjoying yourself.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.040
Hercule. I'm going to investigate
the archives.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.000
Feel free to go back to bed.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.840
Found it.
The will?

17:12.840 --> 17:15.640
Listen. It's addressed to
Sir William's daughter.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.360
"The King must have his crown.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.800
"Should I fall in battle, from my
ashes shill rise the knowledge he
require."

17:21.800 --> 17:26.200
From my ashes." Was his body burned?

17:26.200 --> 17:29.600
In the will, he asked to be buried
in the family crypt.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.080
Ashes? A fireplace perhaps?

17:32.080 --> 17:36.720
Look. This plan was drawn by
a visiting 18th century clergyman.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.080
According to these, there was a
fireplace in the solar.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.520
Sir William's private quarters.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.560
Either your clergyman was fond
of artistic embellishment

17:50.560 --> 17:52.760
or it's been blocked up.
I'll check upstairs.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.560
Wait. The old solar is behind
all this.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.360
Here.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.840
Allow me.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.440
What will we tell Lady Cecily?

18:14.440 --> 18:17.280
That I was teaching you
an Irish jig and got carried away.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.520
It's a boar.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.680
The symbol of Richard III.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.840
"The Golden Legend."

18:48.440 --> 18:50.040
The book of saints.

18:51.160 --> 18:57.640
One of the earliest texts printed in
English. Caxton. 1483.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.680
Must be worth a king's ransom.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.080
At the very least,
it will help us find one.

19:02.080 --> 19:07.440
"Follow Saynt Sylvester's steps.
The dragon guards the crown."

19:07.440 --> 19:10.480
Dragon? What does it mean?

19:10.480 --> 19:13.040
Don't move.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.920
I told you you should leave.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.160
Really? Now?

19:18.160 --> 19:20.280
You've got some explaining to
do, Father.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.360
I'm so sorry that Brent had
to rush off without saying goodbye.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.760
Business is busy-ness.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.880
Oh, your gardens, Lady Cecily,
are truly delightful.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.160
And the peacocks.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.560
I'm sure our guests will be
most appreciative.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.760
I've had quite a lot of time on my
hands the last few years.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.760
May I ask a personal question?

19:49.760 --> 19:50.920
Of course.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.800
To have lived here alone for so
long...

19:53.800 --> 19:56.000
Was there never anyone
else?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.360
I put my heart back together again,
bit by bit.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.240
But I could never really give it
to anyone again.

20:03.240 --> 20:09.280
Not properly. I didn't dare. Here.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.880
Make a wish.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.600
For a marriage full of love
and happiness.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.240
A happy marriage.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.600
Well, I must go
and set preparations for lunch.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
Feel free to Look around.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.840
Oh, thank you.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.960
Where has Father Brown got to?

20:40.960 --> 20:43.160
His note said they were going to
the village.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.400
At least it looks like
You Know Who has left.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.320
Yes, and good riddance.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.120
All right, out with it.
Why have you really come back?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.040
I missed you.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.640
I missed Kembleford.
I was homesick. Satisfied?

20:58.640 --> 21:02.920
No. Has something happened
with Monty?

21:02.920 --> 21:06.480
Why, would you...?

21:06.480 --> 21:09.560
Oh, fine. We had a row.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.840
Hardly the first time, I know,

21:13.840 --> 21:18.800
but this time it was rather fierce.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.880
And prolonged.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.520
I thought we'd benefit from being on
separate continents for a while.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.920
Is it really that bad?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.880
I envy Lady Cecily.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.520
For her, love is eternally perfect.

21:35.880 --> 21:40.600
A champagne picnic on a summer's
day, crystallised in time.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.320
She'll never have to watch it fade.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.800
Angelini searched your study.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.480
He found this.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.840
Hercule Flambeau is a troubled soul
in search of redemption.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.120
Wrong. He's a desecrator
of holy relics.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.000
A cancer eating away at
the Church.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.160
He must not be tolerated.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.280
You planned this?

22:15.280 --> 22:19.320
We came here to find the tiara
and catch a thief.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.520
Will Flambeau be taken to Rome
to stand trial?

22:22.520 --> 22:25.600
Flambeau's to be handed over to
the authorities in Spain.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.760
Spain?

22:26.760 --> 22:29.720
Three years ago, he worked with an
anti-government faction there,

22:29.720 --> 22:33.040
stealing certain artefacts from
Franco's personal collection.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.960
If he was working for the
resistance,

22:36.960 --> 22:40.840
that will mean the death sentence.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.720
That is out of our hands.

22:43.880 --> 22:48.480
But...
Concentrate on finding the tiara!

22:48.480 --> 22:51.080
No.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.280
No?

22:52.280 --> 22:55.560
I will not be part of sending
a man to his death.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.600
You'd take the side of a degenerate
thief

23:00.600 --> 23:04.280
over your instructions from
the highest authority?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.400
You'll face excommunication
for this.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.560
Nevertheless, I will not locate
the tiara

23:16.560 --> 23:20.040
unless Flambeau receives a fair
trial,

23:20.040 --> 23:23.080
either here or in Rome.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.120
Very well.

23:27.120 --> 23:30.040
Let him rot in jail...

23:30.040 --> 23:32.240
..if you find the tiara.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.160
Where's Father Brown?

23:43.160 --> 23:44.760
He's with the Cardinal.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.600
He'll be back soon.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.280
You really don't remember me, do
you?

23:49.280 --> 23:51.000
Don't take it personally.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.200
I've had my share of encounters
with the law.

23:53.200 --> 23:58.280
Yet you always seem to escape.
Unlike me.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.320
Monte Carlo?

24:13.320 --> 24:14.880
The war had just finished?

24:14.880 --> 24:16.160
No?

24:36.680 --> 24:40.640
Vincenzo? I thought you were dead.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.440
Nearly.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.320
I got thrown in Monaco's
Maison d'Arret,

24:45.320 --> 24:48.880
while you vanished with the House of
Grimaldi's family jewels.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.400
Adesso siamo insieme,
un'altra volta.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.360
I said I'd find you.

25:01.280 --> 25:05.160
According to The Golden Legend,
a dragon was terrorising Rome.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.200
Saint Sylvester found the dragon's
lair and bound its mouth.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.040
Shall I ask Lady Cecily if she has
a statue of a dragon?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.560
Or a painting?

25:13.560 --> 25:16.200
No. The less she knows about this
the better.

25:16.200 --> 25:20.080
We need to find it
ourselves. Quickly.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.320
I heard the police coming
and hid. You'd have done the same.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.440
You tipped them off and
left me to take the blame.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.160
If that's what you choose
to believe,

25:32.160 --> 25:35.120
let me make amends.
I'll help you find the tiara.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.040
I only ask for a small cut.
Say 40%?

25:39.040 --> 25:42.800
Make a deal with
the man that left me for dead

25:42.800 --> 25:44.880
and then slept with my wife?

25:44.880 --> 25:48.120
In my defence, we both thought she'd
just become a widow.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.880
I was trying to cheer her up.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.000
I'm really going to enjoy
killing you, Hercule.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.400
KNOCK AT DOOR

26:01.800 --> 26:03.400
Hello?

26:03.400 --> 26:04.720
One second.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.160
Who are you...?
I'm Mr Cable's personal assistant.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.760
I'm here to collect some belongings
he left behind.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.520
What was that?

26:33.480 --> 26:35.720
Look what you made me do.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.720
Now I have to get some more rope.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.600
Isn't that just typical?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.000
There's me, turning the house
upside-down

26:53.000 --> 26:54.920
while you're just sat
there reading.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.280
Where is Lady Felicia?

26:58.280 --> 27:02.840
Searching the garden,
for all the good it'll do.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.320
No sign of fire-breathing
dragons anywhere.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.840
Not even a lizard with halitosis.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.680
Maybe you shouldn't be looking
for the dragon.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.280
Maybe we should be looking for
the pit. What pit?

27:16.280 --> 27:18.520
The dragon lived in a pit.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.600
A cave on the outskirts of the city.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.720
TAPPING

27:22.720 --> 27:24.480
Did you hear that?

27:24.480 --> 27:29.720
Reminds me of the Presbytery.
Same awful racket our boiler makes.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.320
That isn't a boiler.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.600
That's a message.

27:43.560 --> 27:49.800
Lady Cecily. Lady Cecily,
can you hear me?

27:49.800 --> 27:53.520
Angelini's an impostor.
His real name is Vincenzo Gavagna.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.320
Huh! What have you done?!

27:55.320 --> 27:58.200
It was Angelini.
He wants the tiara for himself.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.400
Oh, and why should we believe you?

28:00.400 --> 28:03.080
Because he's telling the truth.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.920
The real Inspector Angelini

28:04.920 --> 28:07.160
is somewhere at the bottom of
the Tiber.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.960
Excuse me,
this woman needs a doctor.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.000
No doctors.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.360
Not until Father Brown brings me
the tiara.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.880
She could be dead by then.

28:15.880 --> 28:21.480
Then he'd better hurry up.
You have until sunset, Father.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.200
After that, I'm going to shoot
someone every hour

28:24.200 --> 28:27.040
until you run out of friends.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.720
And then I'm going to shoot you.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.280
But we can't be certain
the tiara's even here.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.200
Have faith, Father.

28:37.120 --> 28:42.200
And if I find the tiara,
you'll let everyone go?

28:42.200 --> 28:44.280
Except the Flambeau.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.720
We have history.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.160
Well?

28:50.160 --> 28:56.280
I believe we are looking for
a cave or a pit within the grounds.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.080
Excellent.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.680
I'm going to tie up your friends
and then help you look.

29:01.680 --> 29:06.640
Making sure you don't call
the police, of course.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.680
There was no splash!

29:10.320 --> 29:13.600
Father,
I think I know where the pit is.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.720
Well, well. Follow his steps.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.120
X marks the spot?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.880
They're Roman numerals.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.160
There's more.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.800
12, 31.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.480
It's a date.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.720
31st of December.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.160
New Year's Eve?

29:42.160 --> 29:44.400
The feast of Saint Sylvester.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.560
It appears we've found
the entrance to the dragon's lair.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.800
CLATTERING ECHO

29:51.800 --> 29:54.240
Do you mind if I don't go down
there?

29:54.240 --> 29:57.000
I'm not very good with heights.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.320
Got it?

30:01.320 --> 30:04.160
Um-mm.
Excellent. Pass it to me.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.400
Mm?

30:05.400 --> 30:07.080
Use your imagination.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.680
Well, don't drop it,
whatever you do.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.920
Hurry up. I should never have come.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.520
I wanted to teach Monty a lesson.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.640
He probably hasn't even noticed
I've gone.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.360
Then the man's a fool.
You don't get to have an opinion.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.480
Got it.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.720
Untie me.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.160
But think of all
the fun we could have.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.040
Very well. But may I say

30:28.040 --> 30:30.400
how much I've enjoyed our time in
captivity together?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.400
Just get on with it.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.360
What now?

30:45.360 --> 30:49.520
Saint Sylvester was instructed
to walk 150 paces into the pit.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.680
There he would find the dragon.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.040
OK. Avanti.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.320
One, two, three, four.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.080
That's it? You're just running off
and leaving us?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.520
I'm going after Angelini.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.360
Going after the tiara, more like.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.440
My priority is rescuing
Father Brown.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.960
What about us?

31:09.960 --> 31:13.360
There is a madman on the loose
and Lady Cecily,

31:13.360 --> 31:16.360
I think she may have broken her hip.
We can't move her.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.760
You stay here. Barricade the door.
I'll go with Flambeau.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.520
Can't get enough of me?I don't
trust you not to steal the tiara

31:22.520 --> 31:25.000
and then leave us. We'll come back
for you when it's safe.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.160
Well, do be careful.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.080
Tell me you have a plan.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.960
I'll improvise.Oh, good.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.520
Well,
while he's busy shooting you,

31:33.520 --> 31:36.280
I'll bash him over the head
with this.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.760
What?
I know you're unhappy.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.480
You've been unhappy for a long time.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.520
I saw it in your eyes
the first day we met.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.000
What business is that of yours?

31:48.000 --> 31:51.200
Because we both know there's
something between us.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.120
I've had quite enough
of your mockery.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.520
Oh, I'm not mocking you.
I'm deadly serious.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.680
I bribed a servant
of yours in Rhodesia

31:58.680 --> 32:01.240
to let me know when you were
returning to Kembleford.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.280
What are you saying?

32:03.280 --> 32:04.880
I'm not here for the tiara.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.040
The treasure I came for is you.

32:14.720 --> 32:19.360
148, 149, 150.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.000
One dragon.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.080
May I borrow your belt?

32:26.080 --> 32:27.600
My belt?

32:27.600 --> 32:30.560
Saint Sylvester bound
the dragon's mouth.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.160
"Non furtum facies".

33:03.160 --> 33:04.720
"Do not steal."

33:12.240 --> 33:19.080
Saint Sylvester took two lanterns
into the pit...

33:19.080 --> 33:24.120
And after he bound
the dragon's mouth,

33:24.120 --> 33:29.320
he knelt and offered a prayer
to God.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.480
Why not?

33:45.480 --> 33:47.640
Abandon my entire life?

33:47.640 --> 33:50.480
Move to New York with
a man that I hardly know?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.160
Well, what do you want to know?

33:52.160 --> 33:54.240
I'll tell you anything.
Just say yes.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.960
You couldn't handle me.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.440
Try me.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.840
No. I can't simply leave my husband

34:00.840 --> 34:03.360
and run off to the other side of
the world.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.400
Isn't that exactly what you've
already done?

34:05.400 --> 34:07.680
Only to return to Montague,
my home.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.760
So you'd sooner be like Lady Cecily
and grow old

34:09.760 --> 34:12.440
and lonely in your mansion wondering
what might have been?

34:12.440 --> 34:16.480
Well, right now,
I'd sooner save Father Brown.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.480
You stay here in case they
come back.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.440
Where are you going?To check the
groundsman's shed for a shotgun.

34:22.440 --> 34:25.320
And if you're lucky,
I won't use it on you!

34:25.320 --> 34:26.360
Ha!

35:00.360 --> 35:03.000
Want to shoot me?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.800
Go on, shoot me.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.200
Do it.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.920
Give me that.

35:15.160 --> 35:18.560
I have no further use for you,
Father.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.880
So get on your knees.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.240
I'm not a monster.
I would not shoot a priest

35:31.240 --> 35:34.680
so hopefully somebody is
going to find you down here.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.800
Perhaps in 500 years?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.360
Arrivederci, Father.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.440
Figlio, spirito santo.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.880
I should've
killed you the moment I saw you.

36:04.880 --> 36:08.280
Isn't hindsight a wonderful thing?
What did that achieve?

36:08.280 --> 36:10.920
It stopped him escaping.Yes, but by
trapping him down there

36:10.920 --> 36:13.880
with Father Brown.
It buys us time. Find a shotgun?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.880
No.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.280
I have a proposal.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.840
Aren't you just full of them?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.880
I'll lower another rope if you agree

36:21.880 --> 36:25.760
to send up Father Brown with
the tiara. And the gun.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.720
I've a better idea.
You drop the rope.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.760
I keep the gun and the tiara.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.840
And I don't shoot Father Brown in
the head.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.640
No deal, sorry.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.080
Didn't you hear what he said?
He won't shoot his hostage.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.520
He knows we'd leave him down there.
We'll have to wait him out.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.440
What have you done?

36:44.440 --> 36:45.960
You may not
want to wait too long.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.560
You called the police?
I thought...

36:47.560 --> 36:49.160
If they turn up,
he'll get desperate.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.480
Father Brown could get caught in
the crossfire.

36:52.480 --> 36:56.280
New offer. A straight swap.
Me for Father Brown.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.000
I'll lower a rope and climb down

36:58.000 --> 37:00.080
if you let Father Brown
and the others go.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.320
Are you mad? He'll shoot you.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.760
Exactly. I'm the one he wants dead.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.760
It's the only way Father Brown
walks free.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.560
You'd sacrifice yourself
to save him?

37:09.560 --> 37:12.240
Why not?
He's spent years trying to save me.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.640
It's a deal.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.360
But any tricks,
I'll kill you both.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.840
Will you help me look
for another rope?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.200
Mon dieu.

37:33.680 --> 37:37.880
It appears Flambeau values your life
higher than his own.

37:37.880 --> 37:42.560
It is never too late
to turn away from evil.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.360
You gave your word.
Let the priest climb up.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.320
Then you can do as you wish.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.280
On your way, Father.
You won't want to see this.

37:53.960 --> 37:57.480
A moment, please, before I go?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.840
If you must. But be quick.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.400
Father?

38:02.400 --> 38:05.760
Do you truly repent your past?

38:05.760 --> 38:08.240
I do.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.880
Then kneel before God.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.200
Father, forgive me.
For I have sinned.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.040
And yet you are here.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.000
You warned me I'd find myself in
a hole

38:22.000 --> 38:24.480
from which there'd be
no escape. Have faith.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.720
Trust in the lord
and you will find salvation.

38:36.560 --> 38:41.560
Deinde ego te absolvo
a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris,

38:41.560 --> 38:45.480
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
Enough. Go.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.960
Amen.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.160
Goodbye, Flambeau.

39:00.240 --> 39:05.480
So this is it, huh?
The great Hercule Flambeau.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.400
Shot dead in a stinking pit.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.200
You have any last words?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.000
None spring to mind.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.800
Looking for these?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.080
Never trust a priest.
Especially not that one.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.480
That's a bit rich, coming from you.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.680
You're in safe hands now,
Lady Cecily.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.640
You are a good woman, Mrs O'Shea.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.920
No, I'm not.

39:44.920 --> 39:50.960
And my name isn't O'Shea.
It's McCarthy. Bridget McCarthy.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.320
But who...?
I can explain.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.240
I'm glad someone can.

39:56.240 --> 39:59.880
Inspector? Heard a police report of
a priest stuck down a well.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.120
I thought "If that's who
I think it is,

40:02.120 --> 40:04.240
I've got to see this for myself."

40:04.240 --> 40:07.200
Is the Father still in need
of assistance Mrs McCarthy?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.600
No, he's not.
That's a relief.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.360
But there is someone you will
want to speak to.

40:12.360 --> 40:15.280
Regarding the murder of
an Italian policeman

40:15.280 --> 40:18.160
and the assault on Lady Cecily.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.480
Might not be a wasted trip,
after all.

40:27.080 --> 40:31.480
Perhaps you should return it to
the Cardinal.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.240
Beautiful, isn't it?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.360
Are you still going to America?

40:45.360 --> 40:48.280
I'm leaving tomorrow.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.240
Then this really is goodbye.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.000
Thank you for rescuing me.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.640
Thank you for taking
the bullets out of his gun.

40:56.640 --> 41:00.440
I was beginning to think I'd
miscalculated how much I like you.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.360
And if you really have changed,

41:02.360 --> 41:07.640
then maybe we will meet again,
beyond the pearly gates.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.160
If you get to the bar first,
mine's a large Scotch.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.800
Could you give us a moment?

41:20.400 --> 41:22.880
Shouldn't you be going?

41:22.880 --> 41:25.960
You don't want the police
to find you here.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.640
Probably, yet I can't seem
to tear myself away.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.880
I'm a married woman.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.760
Your respect for the sanctity of
marriage

41:35.760 --> 41:39.400
is one of
the many things I love about you.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.600
You don't love me.
Don't I?

41:42.600 --> 41:46.080
You say you wish
to turn your back on crime.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.240
But I'm just a prize.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.840
A trophy to be taken from under
the nose of another man.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.440
That's not true.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.000
Yes, it is.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.400
You're wearing the necklace, I see.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.800
Forgive me for not returning
it sooner.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.320
It was the only thing I had
to remind me of you.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.120
No.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.600
POLICE SIREN

42:11.520 --> 42:13.480
Last chance.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.680
We could make each other
very happy.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.440
I wish that were true.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.640
WHISTLE BLOWS

42:24.640 --> 42:26.320
Send me a postcard.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.840
Forgive my foolishness.

42:36.840 --> 42:39.800
I should never have let that man
deceive me.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.880
Do not blame yourself.

42:41.880 --> 42:46.000
Better to believe a liar than
to doubt an honest man.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.440
Trust me, he shall be dealt with.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.920
Talking of which, I must return.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.320
It's a long journey back to Rome.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.000
The tiara?

43:17.440 --> 43:19.480
It's from Flambeau.

43:22.040 --> 43:26.440
Surely the Vatican has enough jewels
hidden in its crypts?

43:26.440 --> 43:27.600
All aboard!

43:32.960 --> 43:36.960
Nonetheless, I meant what I said
about a clean slate.

43:39.200 --> 43:44.360
Though how well I'll learn to resist
temptation, only time will tell.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.000
POLICE SIRENS

43:46.000 --> 43:48.520
NEW YORKER:
Hot dogs! Get ya hot dogs here!

43:54.680 --> 43:58.800
Madame. You dropped this.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.840
Oh, gee, thanks.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.560
No harm done.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.280
Goodbye, old friend.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.320
Or should I say au revoir?
