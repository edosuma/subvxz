00:02.440 --> 00:04.635
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Are we doing this?

00:04.840 --> 00:06.910
It's not like we haven't before.

00:07.080 --> 00:10.231
You can't drink, you can't have sushi.
What are you, pregnant? 

00:10.400 --> 00:13.358
One of our partners went behind
our backs to a friend at city council...

00:13.520 --> 00:15.317
...and got them to deny us
the liquor license.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.948
So he's profiting from our loss.
He's Caleb Nichol.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.792
You're upset because
she's marrying Dad.

00:19.960 --> 00:20.949
Yeah, for his money.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.873
Last time I talked to Marissa,
she was planning on moving in with us.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.270
Manipulate me?!
Hold my daughter hostage?!

00:27.440 --> 00:28.634
Theresa's pregnant.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.358
And it might not be Eddie's.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.269
Thor. It's a strong name.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.554
- No one's gonna mess with Thor.
- Thanks.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.836
Seth's a good name for a boy too.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.833
Although, at Camp Tokaho,
I was often referred to as a girl...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.558
...so I guess it works either way.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.951
- Can we not play the name game?
- Right. Sorry. It's premature.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.633
She's probably not even pregnant.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.836
- Maybe you shoot blanks.
- I feel much better.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.556
Sorry. If you're in no mood to kid,
l..."Kid."

01:02.720 --> 01:04.516
That's an unfortunate choice of a word.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.315
- We don't even know if this kid is mine.
- We don't even know if there is a kid.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.516
How much faith can you put
in a pee swab?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.908
Seth, don't say "swab."

01:12.080 --> 01:14.196
Ryan Atwood just made a joke.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.351
Yeah. Gotta keep
a sense of humor, right?

01:16.520 --> 01:20.433
Hey, stuffed in a locker, shoes full
of the water-polo team's urine...

01:20.600 --> 01:22.158
...never funnier.
- Good to know.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.470
Yeah. In fact, having you around
to defend me...

01:24.640 --> 01:27.279
...I've kind of gotten soft
not having anyone picking on me.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.513
So really been no need
for the Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.834
My dad hates cilantro.
If you put cilantro on anything...

01:43.000 --> 01:44.831
...I may be uninvited to the wedding.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.638
Somebody get me some cilantro.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.394
Colored lights? No way.
White lights only...

01:49.560 --> 01:53.269
...because colored lights remind my father
of a carnival, and he hates carnies.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.352
Note to self: Hang with carnies.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.479
Yeah. Great.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.030
I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks. Bye.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.116
Well, the wedding rehearsal is confirmed.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.517
This wedding is actually happening.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.591
Never have people deserved
each other more.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.990
I can't believe my dad is
walking with a black eye.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.549
I know. That's because
Jimmy punched him.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.756
If I had, he'd be walking
with a broken nose.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.036
What are the odds of you
making up before the wedding?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.873
I would say not good at all.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.792
It's important to me.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.838
A daughter wants her father to be happy
on his wedding day.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.879
And here I was thinking it was
supposed to be the other way around.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.915
Well, what if I...

02:37.080 --> 02:39.071
...begged?

02:40.240 --> 02:41.798
Groveled?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.996
- Maybe cajoled?
- Oh, honey, come on.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.479
He sabotaged my restaurant.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.430
He committed fraud. There's no way
I could possibly forgive him.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.672
Well, maybe I could pretend...

03:00.960 --> 03:02.837
...to forgive him.

03:09.360 --> 03:14.559
Maybe I could apologize
with my fingers crossed.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.631
Hey, you're not at school.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.518
Yeah, we were at the doctor's office.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.716
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.798
I'm pregnant.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.399
Well, except for that.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.913
So it's official?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.911
Yeah. It is.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.036
And does she know who the father is?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.553
No.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.473
They don't like to do paternity
tests until the baby's born.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.517
Too dangerous, I guess.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.956
But there's a chance
that it could be yours?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.796
- We were broken up.
- Oh, right.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.916
No, totally.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.872
- We were broken up for, like, a week.
- I'm sorry.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.112
I wish I could take it back. Believe me.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.792
If you wanna...

04:42.960 --> 04:46.396
- You know, I'll understand.
- Like there's a choice.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.154
I mean, if you're the father, then...

04:50.120 --> 04:53.715
...well, you and Theresa...
- No. No, I want to help her out...

04:53.880 --> 04:55.472
...but I also...

04:55.640 --> 04:57.870
I want to make this work...

04:58.040 --> 04:59.996
...between us.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.312
These are decaf, right?
If they're not...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.994
...I'm gonna be up for days. Thank you.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.799
Thanks.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.476
- I'm freaking out, Cohen.
- You're freaking out?

05:19.640 --> 05:21.039
You hear about Ryan and Theresa?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.236
What about my best friend?

05:23.400 --> 05:26.153
- Princess Sparkle is freaking out?
- Marissa, dumb-ass.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.993
I always get those two confused.
They have really shiny hair.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.037
How can you even joke about this?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.872
Because, I don't know, I have to.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.600
I'm not emotionally equipped
to process this information.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.354
It's not bad enough she has to live
with Lucifer and Julie?

05:38.520 --> 05:41.876
- I get those two confused as well.
- What'll happen to Ryan and Marissa?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.678
They're, like, the perfect couple.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.479
Based on your parents' marriage,
I sort of understand that.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.110
- I'm holding hot coffee, Cohen.
- Look, I don't know what's gonna happen.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.714
I just wish there was something
I could do to help him.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.871
We just got past all this drama...

05:55.040 --> 05:57.110
...and this summer was supposed
to be all-time.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.919
Yeah, well, now it's all up in the air.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.071
- We're not having sex, by the way.
- Excellent.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.310
There's not enough pain
and suffering already.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.279
Excuse me.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.476
Sorry about the wait.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.628
Hi.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.554
Hi.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.551
I wanted to see if you wanted to talk.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.475
We're a little understaffed.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.837
Eighty-five cents. Great. I'll put it
towards baby's college tuition.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.356
If you want to talk about it... That.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.476
Theresa, the register's broken.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.551
Sorry.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.958
Now, there's a portrait of a man
headed to the altar.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.588
- What the hell do you want?
- No, it's not what I want.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.716
It's what Kirsten wants.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.677
D Átente. Peace.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.957
- The promise of a feud-free wedding.
- You've come to the wrong groom.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.236
You wanna apologize, do so,
but do it quick.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.960
You have no idea how much cajoling
it took to get me here.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.271
- I'm only here because of Kirsten.
- It's always because of Kirsten.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.791
When you railroaded my dinner...

07:22.960 --> 07:25.758
...was that because of her too?
- No, that one was for you.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.796
So, what are you gonna do...

07:28.960 --> 07:31.110
...when I'm not around to make you
feel better about yourself?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.589
- You going somewhere?
- Maybe.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.591
Like, say, San Quentin.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.670
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What did you think I was doing in Vegas?

07:42.840 --> 07:44.876
Besides flipping my restaurant
for a tidy sum?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.871
I was trying to save the Newport Group.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.556
Selling that property was supposed to
keep this company from going bankrupt.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.199
Kirsten never said anything.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.909
That's because residential real estate
is our only profitable division.

07:57.080 --> 08:01.039
She doesn't know anything about the
bad investments, the debts, the losses.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.476
Sell to somebody else. Robert Campbell
can't be the only buyer in town.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.189
It doesn't mean as much to anyone else.
Campbell owns the rest of the coastline.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.113
This property was the last piece
of the puzzle he was missing.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.919
So that's why you wanted us
out of the restaurant so fast.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.230
You sneaky...

08:16.400 --> 08:19.039
...not-so-successful son of a bitch.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.236
Enjoy it while you can.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.868
I got the DA all over me again.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.838
Must smell blood in the water.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.434
Have a nice day, Sandy.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.039
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

08:39.679 --> 08:40.908
What are you doing?

08:41.080 --> 08:44.311
You know, preparing to move
into the house on Haunted Hill.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.318
You know...

08:47.480 --> 08:50.392
...you don't have to do this.
I'd sooner give back the check...

08:50.560 --> 08:53.791
...than have you move in with your mom.
- Then you're left with nothing.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.552
You'd have to move to Phoenix.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.632
Well, at least this way,
I can still see you.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.594
Life just wasn't this complicated
when I was growing up.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.359
Yeah, I know. It feels like we're
constantly being punished for something.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.597
- Mom just keeps on ticking.
- Hey.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.957
Your mom has to wake up every
morning and be Julie Cooper.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.790
That is punishment enough.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.596
Come on. Let's take a break.
What do you say?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.876
Go down to the pier and get a Balboa Bar?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.074
I can't.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.470
I've just got so much to do.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.198
- Does Theresa's mom know?
- No, not yet.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.032
Theresa's not ready to tell her.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.872
Besides, it'll make it feel too real.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.871
I have news for you. It's real.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.508
- Sandy.
- There's no point in sugarcoating it.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.114
You know how many unwed mothers
come through my office?

09:52.280 --> 09:53.599
We all know how real this is.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.558
- Can we just eat dinner?
- All right.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.797
Hey, look...

09:59.960 --> 10:02.520
...we are what we are,
and we'll help you through this.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.593
- We can do it together.
- Hey, man.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.955
They raised me, okay? Proof pudding.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.994
Speaking of pudding, Mother,
do I have any tapioca on tap?

10:10.160 --> 10:13.277
- You are king of the segue.
- I just love pudding. It's so fun to say.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.829
Pudding. Pudding.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.195
Our child-rearing skills speak
for themselves.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.713
Pudding.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.108
Oh, hi, sweetie.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.350
I have my secret recipe, takeout.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.158
- No, thanks. I ate at work.
- Pudding.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.869
- Ryan, can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.791
So, what's going on?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.158
I've been thinking.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.514
We haven't really talked about it.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.475
You're not ready for this.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.235
- I'm not ready for this.
- Yeah, I know, but we can...

10:54.400 --> 10:56.118
I can't do this.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.756
I'm not gonna do it.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.030
I'm not gonna have it.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.316
The baby.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.758
You're not?

11:11.080 --> 11:13.116
You can tell the Cohens...

11:13.280 --> 11:14.872
...but I can't tell my mom.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.110
Hey, you're off the hook.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.273
I have to go down and renew
my dock fees for my boat, man.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.318
You wanna go down there with me,
maybe take her out for a spin?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.391
- Sure, sounds good.
- No, it sounds great.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.790
Come on. We haven't even been on
since last summer.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.679
Remember last summer? We were
just getting to know each other.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.308
Now look at us. Best friends.
Brothers, even.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.835
What do brothers do, Ryan?
You know what brothers do?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.956
Brothers sail.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.792
What brothers sail?

11:54.960 --> 11:57.713
The Wright Brothers.
Before they invented airplanes.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.518
How do you think they got everywhere?

11:59.680 --> 12:01.272
The Ringling Brothers...

12:01.440 --> 12:05.433
...with their chimps and their tigers.
It was like Noah's Ark on that boat.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.319
- Hanson. Playing cruise lines.
- Okay, we'll go sailing.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.029
No, get excited, okay?
You dodged a bullet.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.034
Not that... Not that... It's... You...

12:15.200 --> 12:16.918
Bullet.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.718
I just think that it's cool.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.154
Not so much cool, but...

12:20.320 --> 12:22.880
Okay, I just... I don't know.
I thought you'd be relieved.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.508
No. No, I am. It's complicated.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.592
Too complicated for banter
about boats and Hanson?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.956
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.476
Can I get you anything?
Tea? Toast? Dramamine?

12:40.640 --> 12:42.073
No, thanks.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.913
I don't want to be late.
I'm only working a half-day today.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.191
I have an appointment
at Planned Parenthood.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.756
Is Ryan gonna go with you?

12:49.920 --> 12:53.037
No, I haven't told him.
He's freaked out enough as it is.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.350
What about your mother?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.431
No, I can't.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.192
She's extremely religious.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.751
Well, you'll need someone there
to listen to the doctors...

13:03.920 --> 13:06.559
...because you're gonna have
a million things on your mind.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.513
You won't want to drive.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.353
I'm an excellent driver
and amazing parker.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.753
Thanks. I hate parallel parking.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.832
So how are you doing with it?

13:19.000 --> 13:24.199
- Are you relieved, sad, disappointed?
- All of the above. Yes.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.670
- Well, did she say when she was gonna...?
- Soon.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.112
I guess.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.758
Well, then at least maybe everything
can go back to normal.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.639
Not that anything around here
ever is normal.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.030
More normal than this.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.832
I think we should spend this whole
summer just being normal.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.710
- We won't hold Seth to that, will we?
- No. No, that would be impossible.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.308
I was talking more about us.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.193
You're just full of surprises.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.229
I hear water. And by the way, Caleb...

14:14.400 --> 14:17.073
...we should hold on to this blindfold.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.879
- Oh, gosh.
- Good to know.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.393
Oh, my God! It's a palace.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.959
Fit for a queen?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.550
Oh, Cal. It's amazing.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.039
I built it just for you.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.711
It's more than I ever
could have imagined.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.069
I want to live here forever.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.040
Oh, I've missed you.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.679
It's been too long.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.798
- You're talking to a boat, Seth.
- I talk to a plastic horse too...

14:50.960 --> 14:53.190
...but that never worries anyone.
- It worried me.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.032
Hey.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.112
I forgot about this.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.555
This compass is gonna lead me
all the way to Tahiti.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.156
Yeah, whatever happened to that
big plan to sail to Tahiti?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.072
You showed up, man.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.037
Suddenly, I had much less reason to flee.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.959
Newport became kind of...

15:11.640 --> 15:13.676
- Kind of all right.
- Yeah?

15:14.400 --> 15:17.119
- Could've done it in 42 days, though.
- Guess we'll never know.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.350
Yeah, but now that we've got...

15:19.520 --> 15:22.318
...the <i>Summer Breeze</i> back in action,
we can sail to Catalina.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.072
We can take our ladies.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.356
Catch fresh fish right off
the side of the boat.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.795
Cook them right there.
Sounds good, man.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.630
Sounds great.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.439
So I'll take you
to your appointment tomorrow.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.195
You're not taking any anesthetics, so you
don't have to worry about what to eat.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.430
We'll get there about
a half an hour before...

15:45.600 --> 15:46.999
...and fill out some forms.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.234
Everyone there seems really nice.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.633
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.397
You don't have to.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.155
Yeah, I do. I mean...

15:59.320 --> 16:02.039
...I'm in high school, or I should be.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.475
I make $ 11 a day in tips.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.835
Not having this baby...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.594
...makes the most sense.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.838
You don't have to make the decision
that makes the most sense.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.709
Right. Coming from you... I mean...

16:19.880 --> 16:21.279
...your life is so together.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.318
You know, you have
an amazing family...

16:24.480 --> 16:25.913
...great job.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.354
It's perfect.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.876
Nothing's perfect.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.872
Sometimes...

16:36.000 --> 16:39.515
...things just happen.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.797
Yeah, but never to someone
like you, right?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.197
- I'm sorry. L...
- It's okay.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.555
I don't regret the decision I made.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.958
I just wish that when I was
trying to choose...

17:00.120 --> 17:03.112
...there was someone there for me.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.914
Whatever you decide...

17:07.800 --> 17:09.358
...we're here for you.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.313
Hi.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.959
How you feeling?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.997
Pretty lousy.

17:35.840 --> 17:40.072
Remember that part last night
about me not having the baby?

17:41.240 --> 17:43.595
As hard as it is to imagine
having a baby...

17:43.760 --> 17:47.355
...I can't really imagine not having it.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.870
So you're gonna have it.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.156
I have to.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.513
Well, what did you say to her?

18:08.680 --> 18:09.908
I didn't say anything.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.753
So all of a sudden she just decided
to change her mind?

18:12.920 --> 18:15.912
No, it's all of a sudden that
she made all of her decisions.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.799
What? You talked her
into having this child.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.474
So I should let her make
a totally uninformed decision?

18:21.640 --> 18:24.074
They're kids with nothing.
How can they start a family?

18:24.240 --> 18:25.912
That's not our choice.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.638
You know what Ryan's going through?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.553
Not as well as I know
what she's going through.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.679
What does that mean?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.229
Nothing.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.949
It's just, she's alone. She can't talk to
her mother. She's scared and confused.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.076
All I did was listen.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.037
- Oh, hey. You want some breakfast?
- No, thanks. I'll get something later.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.668
I just want to see if Theresa
wants anything.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.070
I should call my dad.
He has to be here by 8.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.310
Have you talked to him?
He doesn't seem himself.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.358
I can't blame him.
I wouldn't want to be him either.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.556
He's about to be bound by law
to Julie Cooper.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.429
Don't remind me. Denial is a
very effective coping mechanism.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.828
It should be some weekend.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.958
Hi.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.918
Want some breakfast? Pancakes?
Waffles?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.718
- You're leaving.
- I'm going home.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.108
I talked to my mom.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.032
I told her everything.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.838
I should have left last night
when I saw the look on your face.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.077
You don't have to leave.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.755
We can figure this out together.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.990
Then come with me.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.193
Never mind breakfast.
I'll grab something on the road.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.712
This place is huge.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.108
It's a castle.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.919
The torture chamber must be
in the basement.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.752
Jimmy, what...?

20:00.920 --> 20:04.117
You should not be here. Caleb's due
back any minute, and thanks to you...

20:04.280 --> 20:06.669
...he has to take his wedding photos
with a black eye.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.752
It'll match the black lump of coal
where his heart should be.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.036
Why can't you be happy for me? I am.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.714
Julie, you can't be happy.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.077
- And that makes me happy.
- Classy choice, Jimmy.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.710
Although, it's obvious you're with her
because you can't be with Kirsten.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.314
I think, in psychology,
that's called "transference."

20:24.840 --> 20:27.035
And you marrying Caleb,
I think, in psychology...

20:27.200 --> 20:29.316
...that's called "shameless gold-digging."
- No.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.040
- That's what his youngest daughter's for.
- Don't make me...

20:32.200 --> 20:34.998
Make you what? Go back to life
as a stripper or a coke whore?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.553
- Someone forgotten about the '80s?
- At least I'm not a criminal.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.314
- Yeah, you're just marrying one.
- Okay, stop it.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.234
Just stop it. No more fighting, okay?

20:45.400 --> 20:48.915
Look, you're getting what you wanted.
I'm moving in with you.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.437
Well, that's what you wanted too,
right, sweetie?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.552
I've got some more stuff in the car.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.393
I'll get the rest of my stuff
out of your house tomorrow.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.718
I can't believe your boat's name
is <i>Summer</i>. What a coincidence.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.519
My name's Summer.
Your boat's named <i>Summer</i>.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.911
- It's kind of crazy.
- Yeah, it's just crazy.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.548
Well, it's the only Summer
you'll be riding for a while.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.950
Right. Yeah, no sex. I got it. Thank you.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.429
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.114
- You got that paperwork?
- Yeah.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.116
So it's still in really good condition.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.431
I got a guy, I think he'll offer 6000.
He's been bugging me a while.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.477
Great. Will you remember to get cash?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.993
- I told him.
- All right. Thanks.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.832
- Come by tomorrow.
- I will.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.912
Six thousand dollars in cash?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.640
- Are you fleeing the country, Cohen?
- No, it's for Ryan.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.233
What? For vintage wife-beaters?

21:51.520 --> 21:53.829
It's actually for Theresa.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.718
For Ryan to give to Theresa.

21:57.040 --> 22:01.272
Listen, don't say anything, okay? Because
I don't even think Ryan's told Marissa yet.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.112
But...

22:03.280 --> 22:05.111
...I think Theresa's gonna have her baby.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.713
What?

22:07.240 --> 22:08.514
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.709
And she's gonna need money, and, you
know, I spent all mine on Vegas hookers.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.553
So this is the only thing
I have that's worth anything.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.038
I just don't know how else to help.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.798
Cohen...

22:31.240 --> 22:33.390
- What the hell's he doing here?
- He's family too.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.278
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.317
- How you doing, Caleb?
- Get away from me.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.993
- Dad.
- Well...

22:39.160 --> 22:42.835
...congrats. She's a hell of a woman.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.308
- Congratulations, Mrs. Cooper.
- Oh, thank you.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.677
Seth. You excited
about being a groomsman?

22:51.560 --> 22:54.552
It's the fulfillment
of a lifelong dream, yeah.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.192
- Hey, guys.
- Marissa.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.477
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.038
Hey, have you guys seen Ryan?
He didn't call me back earlier.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.553
- Do you think he's okay?
- Yeah.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.154
- He takes a long time with his hair.
- His hair, yeah.

23:12.320 --> 23:16.279
- Bangs. I don't know. Mousse. Product.
- You should see him. It's weird.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.678
So, Cal...

23:19.960 --> 23:22.030
...I talked to the DA.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.509
- Otis?
- Yeah.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.036
What did that pantload have
to say for himself?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.758
It's over.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.550
What the hell am I supposed to do?

23:34.760 --> 23:38.036
Well, have you told the future Mrs. Nichol
about your financial situation?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.679
What are you saying, Sandy?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.717
That Julie's only marrying me
for my money?

23:41.880 --> 23:43.518
No, never.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.636
Course not.
But you might think...

23:45.800 --> 23:47.836
...about postponing this thing.
- Impossible.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.991
The wedding is tomorrow.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.312
I have never let anyone push me around,
and this is no exception.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.636
But thanks...

23:56.800 --> 23:58.199
...for trying.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.157
I appreciate it.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.116
It's ironic.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.919
Julie leaves Jimmy, marries you.
Now he's worth millions...

24:06.520 --> 24:08.750
...and you're gonna be broke.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.148
I don't believe in irony.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.436
Well, that's too bad...

24:12.600 --> 24:15.512
...because it might be just the thing
to get you through this.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.752
Hey. What are you doing?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.194
I'm just...

24:24.360 --> 24:26.271
...you know, hiding.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.113
Yeah. I can't blame you.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.909
- So where's Theresa?
- She went back home.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.911
To have the baby.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.598
Well, did she and Eddie make up?

24:42.840 --> 24:45.638
So she's having the baby alone.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.833
I'll keep it brief, I promise.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.915
First, I'd like to thank Kirsten
for hosting a wonderful dinner...

25:01.080 --> 25:02.672
...and to say...

25:02.840 --> 25:06.196
...tomorrow is a truly important event.

25:06.880 --> 25:11.476
As a father, it's a great joy to have
a family and to watch that family grow.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.914
We've all been through
a great deal together...

25:15.080 --> 25:16.798
...for better and for worse.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.188
But tomorrow...

25:18.760 --> 25:23.151
...the Nichols, the Cohens
and the Coopers become one family.

25:24.040 --> 25:27.476
And I feel very lucky to be
at the head of that family.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.359
Cheers and many thanks.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.118
Cheers.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.473
Hey, are you okay?

25:46.640 --> 25:48.915
I just need some air.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.394
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.676
Everything okay?

25:54.080 --> 25:56.435
- Can we just get out of here?
- Please.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.350
You know, Ryan, I...

26:02.520 --> 26:04.476
I think it was this very stretch
of beach...

26:04.640 --> 26:07.438
...where we first got our asses kicked
by the water-polo team.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.828
Yeah?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.558
Could be.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.314
Yes, it definitely tastes the same.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.069
Wait, when was that?

26:18.240 --> 26:21.312
- When I first got here.
- Yeah, it was after that fashion show...

26:21.480 --> 26:22.799
...at Holly's beach house.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.916
You guys were at that party?

26:26.400 --> 26:28.516
Those were the days.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.754
Hey...

26:32.920 --> 26:34.831
...you feeling better?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.191
I've been thinking.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.717
I think...

26:46.560 --> 26:48.596
...I need to go back.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.272
I can't let Theresa do this by herself.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.710
I'm leaving.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.553
Hey.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.870
So we all good? Proof of purchase?
Bill of sale?

27:20.280 --> 27:22.794
Yeah, so the guy called me
this morning, said he...

27:22.960 --> 27:25.315
...couldn't come up with the money.
- What?

27:25.480 --> 27:27.835
What the hell, man?
You told me it was a done deal.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.471
- He said give him a couple of months.
- I can't do that. I need it right now.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.430
- Just forget it. It just figures...
- Sorry, man.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.919
Yeah, well...

27:38.080 --> 27:40.753
...that's the way it's been
going for me lately.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.274
Hey. Okay, I have a plan.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.954
Listen, Ryan doesn't want
to leave, right?

27:52.120 --> 27:54.270
We don't want him to leave. So...

27:54.440 --> 27:55.714
...let's not let him.

27:55.880 --> 27:59.156
We can all get jobs. We can pool
our salaries and cover his apartment...

27:59.320 --> 28:01.231
...an apartment up
in the numbered streets.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.597
Except Theresa wants to be with
her family, and Ryan has to be with her.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.796
What? You wanna give up?
You wanna let him go?

28:06.960 --> 28:10.794
Look, there's nothing else we can do,
other than kidnap him.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.831
If there was something I could do,
I would.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.752
Well, I think you've
done enough, so...

28:16.920 --> 28:18.990
- What does that mean?
- I don't think Ryan...

28:19.160 --> 28:21.879
...would be back with Theresa
if it wasn't for you and Oliver.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.234
- Cohen.
- Really...

28:23.400 --> 28:26.995
...all you ever did was drag that kid
into your messed-up life. I just...

28:27.160 --> 28:29.754
Right. You used him to meet girls
and get out of fights.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.718
- Okay, you guys, come on.
- I don't really care.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.270
I've gotta get ready. So as long
as you're cool with him leaving...

28:40.040 --> 28:42.156
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.392
We'll probably leave in an hour
if Kirsten can get ready in time.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.630
It is a mystery what goes on
in that bathroom.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.030
- Think you'll be done by 6?
- God, I hope so.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.079
That's what time I told Theresa
to pick me up.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.435
You know, as your guardian...

29:00.200 --> 29:01.872
...I can stop you.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.835
But if you taught me anything...

29:06.160 --> 29:09.436
...you gotta do whatever it takes
to protect your family.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.797
- She's my family now.
- We are too.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.594
You can stay here. So can she.
We can make this work as a family.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.236
I can't.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.390
I can't ask that of you.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.957
You've done more than enough...

29:28.120 --> 29:30.588
...more than I ever could've asked
of anyone.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.591
I told you...

29:33.520 --> 29:36.159
...you could've done worse.
- No.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.150
When you took me in, I had nothing.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.392
No family, no hope.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.037
I don't want this kid
to grow up like I did.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.998
Well...

29:56.840 --> 29:59.195
...just because you're leaving...

29:59.640 --> 30:02.279
...doesn't mean I'm letting you go.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.549
Now, come on, get dressed.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.951
We gotta witness the most
unholy of all unions.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.270
You want to dance?

32:34.560 --> 32:37.199
I just want you to know...

32:38.120 --> 32:40.839
...I understand why you have to do this.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.878
Thanks.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.834
But I wish you didn't have to.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.831
Me too.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.196
I love you.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.196
They sent me out to find you.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.235
Found you.

34:14.440 --> 34:18.034
I figured you'd be stuffing your pockets
with cocktail weenies.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.556
You're still gonna see him.

34:23.719 --> 34:25.438
Chino's not that far away.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.830
I just can't believe he's leaving.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.560
He's the first real friend I've ever had.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.880
He's the only real friend I've ever had.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.112
I know.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.911
- You have me.
- Yeah, but that's not the same thing.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.196
You don't get it. Before he got here...

34:44.360 --> 34:48.114
...I was the biggest loser.
This place was hell for me, okay?

34:50.199 --> 34:52.429
And I can't help him, and...
I can't even imagine...

34:52.600 --> 34:55.068
...what it's gonna be like
here without him.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.715
We'll make it through it. I promise.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.836
Could you tell them that I'll be back
in a few minutes, please?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.194
Sure.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.311
Yeah, for the record...

35:15.920 --> 35:18.639
...the boat was named after you.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.228
Hey.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.470
- Hi.
- Is Theresa here?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.192
Should be soon.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.431
A little something for the road.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.873
Don't worry, I didn't make it.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.996
But if I did learn to cook...

36:03.160 --> 36:05.628
...could we convince you to stay?

36:11.400 --> 36:14.119
Thank you for...

36:14.280 --> 36:16.191
...inviting me into your home.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.955
You guys...

36:20.960 --> 36:23.315
This year was...

36:23.480 --> 36:25.436
For us too.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.874
And Kirsten's not even a hugger.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.595
You always know how to ruin a moment.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.796
That's what I do.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.436
I'm gonna say goodbye to Seth.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.952
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.873
Gotta jet.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.268
Cool.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.156
You really gotta go?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.238
Yeah.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.277
Well, if you need a nanny,
I'll take the graveyard shift.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.715
I think we'll manage.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.675
I was afraid you'd say that.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.915
You can come down and visit me.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.875
Hey, so I...

37:38.040 --> 37:40.270
I got you something.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.478
It's yours, you know.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.359
- Always good for ideas.
- Map of Tahiti.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.476
Cool, man.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.638
So I'll see you, then.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.597
See you.
