15:24.233 --> 15:26.933
He could even be me.

15:27.933 --> 15:29.533
Libby, that's not funny.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.967
There is no Libby.
There never was.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.367
Oh!

15:34.367 --> 15:36.367
And now I must do something...

15:36.367 --> 15:38.267
very bad to you, Skipper.

15:38.267 --> 15:39.900
- Please.
- [ Libby Cackling ]

15:40.333 --> 15:43.067
I'll just leave and take a bus home.
I won't tell anybody. Honest!

15:43.067 --> 15:45.600
I can't let you leave.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.367
[ Cackling ]
You belong here now!

15:51.500 --> 15:54.000
I knew,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.067
when I saw you on that
bus the first time.

15:57.067 --> 16:01.367
[ Chuckling ]
I knew you were perfect.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.700
You said you knew
everything about me.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.700
[ Laughing ]

16:08.200 --> 16:11.833
It's so hard to find good
characters for my stories.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.967
It's so hard to find good foes!

16:14.967 --> 16:17.100
[ Yelling ]

16:17.100 --> 16:19.600
[ Cackling ]

16:21.767 --> 16:23.500
What are you gonna do?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.367
- Destroy you, of course.
- No, you can't!

16:26.367 --> 16:28.267
You're just a character
in a comic book!

16:28.933 --> 16:32.200
But I'm real!
I'm a real boy!

16:32.633 --> 16:34.133
No!

16:34.633 --> 16:36.133
You're not, Skipper.

16:36.633 --> 16:38.067
You're not real.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.867
- You're a comic book character too.
- You're a liar!

16:40.867 --> 16:43.300
Yes, I'm a liar!

16:43.300 --> 16:46.267
It's one of my better qualities.

16:46.267 --> 16:50.267
But I'm not lying this time.

16:50.267 --> 16:54.033
- You're not real anymore.
- It's not true!

16:55.967 --> 16:59.900
Remember when you entered the
building for the first time?

16:59.900 --> 17:02.233
Remember when you walked
through the glass door...

17:02.233 --> 17:05.433
and a beam of light
passed over you?

17:05.433 --> 17:08.467
- Yeah, I remember.
- That was a scanner.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.833
When you passed through it,
it scanned your entire body.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.300
It turned you into tiny dots of ink.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.666
- No!
- You're a comic book character.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.166
Just like me!

17:19.166 --> 17:21.433
[ Cackling ]

17:22.800 --> 17:26.267
Say good-bye, Skipper.

17:26.267 --> 17:29.067
[ Cackling ]

17:40.600 --> 17:42.133
No, wait!

17:42.600 --> 17:44.033
I'm not Skipper.

17:45.533 --> 17:46.967
Oh, really?

17:46.967 --> 17:48.967
Then who are you?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.467
I'm-- I'm--

17:51.467 --> 17:52.933
I'm the Colossal Elastic Boy!

17:53.433 --> 17:56.100
Ah! Elastic Boy!

17:56.533 --> 17:58.833
I thought you looked familiar.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.567
Well, good-bye, Mutant. I have to
go back to my home planet of Zargos.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.967
You know, I can't guest star
in other comic books.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.133
Nice try, Elastic Boy,

18:13.633 --> 18:15.967
but you invaded
my secret headquarters.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.833
Now I must destroy you.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.267
No. You can't!

18:22.267 --> 18:25.633
I'll just stretch out my elastic arms
and I'll squeeze you into putty.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.967
I don't think so.

18:27.967 --> 18:30.200
I'm gonna tear you into pieces,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.700
and then tear your pieces
into pieces!

18:32.700 --> 18:36.067
- [ Cackling ]   - No, you can't.
I'll bend, but I won't break.

18:36.067 --> 18:39.133
There's only one way
you can destroy Elastic Boy.

18:40.633 --> 18:45.733
What's that,
if you don't mind me asking?

18:45.733 --> 18:50.133
By sulfuric acid. That's the only
way you can destroy my elastic body.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.633
Oops. I guess
I shouldn't have said that.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.133
Too late!

18:59.633 --> 19:03.133
Say good-bye, Elastic Boy.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.933
[ Cackling ]

19:05.933 --> 19:10.467
- [ Sizzling ]  - Aha! There's one thing
you've forgotten, Mutant.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.467
You can change into
a solid and back,

19:13.467 --> 19:15.767
but once you change into a liquid,
you're dead.

19:15.767 --> 19:18.933
Huh? You tricked me!

19:19.400 --> 19:22.733
The great Masked Mutant
tricked by a boy!

19:22.733 --> 19:26.300
[ Shrieking ]

19:43.600 --> 19:46.600
Yes!
I've destroyed him!

19:46.600 --> 19:49.600
The most evil super villain
to walk the planet is dead!

19:55.767 --> 19:58.800
[ Skipper Laughing Triumphantly ]

20:07.967 --> 20:10.967
Skipper,
there's mail for you again.

20:10.967 --> 20:13.967
If it's a comic book,
you can just throw it out, Mom.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.167
Well, I'll just put it over here.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.167
Maybe you'll change your mind.

20:20.167 --> 20:22.167
Aren't you gonna eat your soup?

20:22.167 --> 20:24.167
No, I'm not hungry.

20:25.167 --> 20:27.167
Are you feeling all right?

20:27.167 --> 20:29.167
Yeah, Mom.
Come on. I feel fine.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.667
Oh, Skipper.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.667
What happened last night?

20:34.667 --> 20:38.500
Mom, I don't want to talk about it.
I'll tell you someday.

20:41.567 --> 20:45.167
What on earth have you got on
your hands? It looks like ink.

20:46.067 --> 20:47.500
Mom!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.500
I won't get any on the furniture.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm gonna go watch TV.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.633
[ Stretching ]

20:58.133 --> 21:00.033
Elastic Boy?

21:02.333 --> 21:03.733
[ Screams ]

21:07.733 --> 21:09.733
Stretch it!

21:10.233 --> 21:12.367
