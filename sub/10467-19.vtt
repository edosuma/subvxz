10:21.490 --> 10:22.491
[COOS]

10:22.491 --> 10:25.233
I KNOW, I KNOW. HANG IN.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.670
HEY, DID WE BLOW A FUSE?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.846
SARAH, YOU'RE NOT
DONE WITH MY HAIR.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.805
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I THINK
WE'VE GOT SOME--

10:31.805 --> 10:33.807
SOME FLASHLIGHTS
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.460
UH, THAT'S OK.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.899
UH, RIGHT...HERE.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.075
I'M SCARED.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.511
OH. OH, IT'S OK,
SWEETIE. COME HERE.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.469

10:48.604 --> 10:51.041
UH, ARE YOU
CLAUDIA SALINGER?

10:51.041 --> 10:52.564
UH-HUH.

10:52.564 --> 10:53.696
ARE YOU THE HOCKEY TEAM?

10:53.696 --> 10:55.393
UH-HUH.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.482
I HAD TO WALK
ALL THE WAY UP THE STAIRS.

10:57.482 --> 11:01.095
UH, I THINK THE POWER
IN YOUR BUILDING WENT OUT.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.750
HOW ASTUTE.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.013
HE MUST BE THE GOALIE.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.450
Owen: CLAUDIA AND SARAH, LOOK!

11:08.450 --> 11:10.582
ALL THE LIGHTS
IN THE CITY ARE OUT.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.802
COME LOOK.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.412
LOOK.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.762
WOW.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.469
Newscaster:
SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN HIT
BY A CITY WIDE BLACKOUT

11:27.469 --> 11:30.124
EARLY REPORTS INDICATE...

11:30.124 --> 11:32.561
HEY, HEY, IT'S OK, SWEETHEART.
SWEETHEART, COME ON.

11:32.561 --> 11:36.130
SHHH. DIANA, HEY, HEY,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.436
Newscaster: CREWS ESTIMATE
AT LEAST SEVERAL HOURS
BEFORE POWER IS RESTORED.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.874
THE MAYOR HAS DECLARED
A STATE OF EMERGENCY

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
AND CALLED FOR
A 9:00 CURFEW.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.268
OK. ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.108
OK, BABY, HANG IN THERE.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.505
I GOT YOU INTO THIS,
AND I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.551
OK.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.118
ALL RIGHT.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.516
CAN YOU GO ANY FASTER,
PLEASE?

12:14.516 --> 12:16.736
SIR, THE CHECKS WERE
ALL IN THE COMPUTER.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.173
I HAVE TO REENTER AND
CALCULATE EVERYTHING BY HAND.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.870
WE HAVE OTHER KIDS.
WE HAVE TO GET HOME.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.263
YOU KNOW WHAT, LAUREN?

12:22.263 --> 12:23.481
LET'S LET
THESE PEOPLE GO, OK?

12:23.481 --> 12:25.701
THAT'S SILLY. IF THEY CAN
JUST WAIT 5 SECONDS.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.703
ARE YOU REFUSING
TO LET US LEAVE?

12:27.703 --> 12:28.748
LAUREN, COME ON.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.792
Woman: ISN'T IT
AGAINST THE LAW?

12:29.792 --> 12:30.837
YOU WANNA KNOW THE LAW?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.186
THE LAW SAYS THAT
SKIPPING A CHECK

12:32.186 --> 12:33.796
WHEN THE POWER'S OUT
IS LOOTING.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.842
LOOTING?
LAUREN, WHAT'S NEXT?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.191
YOU GONNA START
SHOOTING THE CUSTOMERS?

12:37.191 --> 12:38.845
BACK OFF
AND LET ME DO MY JOB.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.498
THERE'S A BLACKOUT
GOING ON, OK?

12:40.498 --> 12:44.198
WE'RE NOT HOLDING
THESE PEOPLE HOSTAGE
TO THEIR CHECKS.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.113
OK, EVERYBODY...

12:46.113 --> 12:48.419
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW,

12:48.419 --> 12:50.421
WHOEVER NEEDS
TO GET HOME
TO THEIR FAMILIES,

12:50.421 --> 12:52.119
WE'LL TRUST THAT
YOU'LL COME BACK LATER
TO SETTLE UP, OK?

12:52.119 --> 12:53.903
IF YOU'LL JUST
WAIT YOUR TURN,

12:53.903 --> 12:55.470
WE'LL HAVE YOU
OUT OF HERE SHORTLY.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.125
LAUREN, YOU'RE NOT
HELPING ANYONE HERE, OK?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.343
WHY ARE THEY
FIGHTING, MOMMY?

13:01.084 --> 13:03.304
MA'AM, I HAVE

13:03.304 --> 13:05.697

13:22.976 --> 13:25.326
WELL, THIS IS
JUST A BLACKOUT,

13:25.326 --> 13:26.893
I MEAN, IF IT'S
NOT THE ELEVATOR.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.982
THEY ALWAYS CHECK
THESE ELEVATORS FIRST.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.592
I HAVE ALL THE CANDLES
FOR THE CAKE

13:30.592 --> 13:32.768
AND ALL OF CLAUDIA'S CDs
FROM THE HOUSE.

13:34.509 --> 13:37.164
NOT TO WORRY, THOUGH,
'CAUSE THESE CARS,

13:37.164 --> 13:40.167
THEY CLAMP
TO THE GUIDE RAILS
AUTOMATICALLY.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.256
AND THE CABLES,
THEY'RE ALL
TRIPLE WELDED.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.779
[BANGING]

13:45.825 --> 13:48.436
GRIFFIN, CAN WE JUST
TALK ABOUT THIS?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.612
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.396
TALK ABOUT WHY WE DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.443
TALK ABOUT WHY WE FEEL
SO WEIRD HERE.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.837
WHO SAYS WE FEEL WEIRD?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.623
GRIFFIN, PLEASE.
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.190
CAN'T WE AT LEAST SAY
WHAT'S ON OUR MINDS?

14:03.190 --> 14:05.975
NOBODY'S STOPPING YOU.
SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.977
OK.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.284
WELL, LOOK...

14:10.284 --> 14:14.070
I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WITH THE WAY YOU HANDLED
THE WHOLE NED THING.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.246
I MEAN...

14:16.246 --> 14:19.815
BEATING HIM UP AND
THE WHOLE KIDNAPPING THING...

14:19.815 --> 14:21.948
GLAD WE'RE TRYING
TO CLEAR THE AIR HERE.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.645
YEAH, IT WAS
A LOUSY RELATIONSHIP.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.038
I KNOW THAT, BUT YOU
GAVE ME ZERO CREDIT

14:25.038 --> 14:26.648
FOR BEING ABLE
TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.650
SOMEBODY PLEASE
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

14:28.650 --> 14:31.392
BUT FORGET
ALL THAT...

14:31.392 --> 14:33.307
IS WHAT I'M SAYING

14:33.307 --> 14:35.352
'CAUSE...

14:35.352 --> 14:38.747
THANK YOU, GRIFFIN.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
JUST...

14:42.838 --> 14:44.579
THANK YOU.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.413
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO SAY THAT...

14:52.413 --> 14:54.937
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.118
I DON'T CARE
WHOSE FAULT IT IS.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.687
JUST LET THAT TOW TRUCK
TAKE YOUR VEHICLES
OFF THE STREET NOW.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.036
EXCUSE ME, OFFICER.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.690
IS YOUR CHILD OK?

15:08.690 --> 15:10.953
YEAH, SHE'S OK. SHE'S JUST
A LITTLE WET AND HUNGRY.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.737
IT'S JUST THE 2 OF YOU?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.348
YEAH. DO YOU KNOW
ANY STORE AROUND HERE
THAT'S OPEN?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.698
ANY PLACE I CAN GET
SOME FORMULA AND DIAPERS?

15:16.698 --> 15:19.440
SORRY, NO. EVERYTHING'S
CLOSING UP FOR CURFEW.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.703
OK. THANKS.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.357
WAIT. WAIT. HOLD UP.

15:23.357 --> 15:27.404
THERE'S A HOSPITAL
JUST A FEW BLOCKS UP
ON UNION.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.449
GREAT.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.798
I FORGOT.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.800
I ACTUALLY KNOW
THAT PLACE PRETTY WELL.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.541
THEY PROBABLY HAVE
THE STUFF YOU NEED.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.803
OK. THANKS.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.372
SURE YOU GOT ENOUGH
BATTERIES FOR THAT BOOM BOX?

15:38.372 --> 15:39.634
YEAH, I GOT IT.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.027
HEY, OWEN, BUDDY,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.724
YOU BREAK THAT ARM
FIGHTING OVER YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

15:42.724 --> 15:44.595
I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.640
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.467
HEY, FREDDIE,
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

15:46.467 --> 15:49.035
GOOD-LOOKING KID
LIKE OWEN? NO WAY.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.429
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANNA
TALK TO THEM,

15:52.429 --> 15:54.170
YOU SHOULD TALK TO THEM.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.780
YEAH?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.173
AND SAY WHAT?

15:57.173 --> 15:58.783
I DON'T KNOW.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.177
OFFER THEM SOME NACHOS.

16:01.177 --> 16:05.268
BUT WHAT IF THEY ASK ME
A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION?

16:05.268 --> 16:07.618
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"WHAT KIND OF CHEESE
IS THIS?"

16:07.618 --> 16:09.664
OR "HEY, YOU EVER BEEN
TO SECOND BASE?"

16:09.664 --> 16:12.972
CLAUDIA, THEY'RE JUST
GUYS IN HIGH SCHOOL...
LIKE YOU.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.931
NO.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.542
NO, THEY ARE NOT
JUST LIKE ME, SARAH.

16:20.544 --> 16:21.893
SEE MIKEY OVER THERE?

16:21.893 --> 16:23.547
HE DATED NADINE BARRY

16:23.547 --> 16:25.941
AND LOST HER VIRGINITY
AT 13.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.551
THEY'VE ALL DONE IT,
SARAH.

16:27.551 --> 16:28.900
ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD SEX.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.555
OK, CLAUDIA.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.949
AND I KNOW WHY
THAT'S SCARY.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.560
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WHO CARES, OK?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.954
THEY'RE HERE,
AND THEY CAME
TO SEE YOU.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.956
THEY BARELY EVEN
KNOW MY NAME.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
OH, REALLY?
THEN, UM...

16:42.566 --> 16:45.482
WHY ARE THEY
CHECKING YOU OUT
RIGHT NOW?

16:45.482 --> 16:47.223
THEY'RE CHECKING ME OUT?

16:47.223 --> 16:48.877
MM-HMM.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.531
WELL, AM I STANDING RIGHT?

16:50.531 --> 16:53.534
I MEAN, I SHOULD LEAN
ON MY ELBOW OR SOMETHING?

16:53.534 --> 16:58.060
UH, MIKEY, CAN YOU
GIVE ME A HAND
OVER HERE?

16:58.060 --> 16:59.844
SARAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:01.672 --> 17:04.327
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU LADIES?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.415

17:05.415 --> 17:06.764

17:06.764 --> 17:07.722
YOU'RE

17:09.724 --> 17:12.074
OH FOOD! FINALLY, YES!

17:14.120 --> 17:16.122

WATCH YOUR BACKS, PLEASE!

17:24.304 --> 17:25.131

17:26.567 --> 17:27.829

17:27.829 --> 17:28.786
HEY.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.400

PRETTY CRAZY NIGHT, HUH?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.141
YEAH. WE'VE GOT
OUR PROBLEMS.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.186
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU OK?

17:37.186 --> 17:38.796
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH DIANA?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.537
NO, NO, NO. WE JUST GOT
STUCK IN SOME TRAFFIC

17:40.537 --> 17:42.191
I FORGOT HER DIAPER BAG.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.019
FIGURED I COULD GET
SOME SUPPLIES HERE.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.455
WE'RE PRETTY JAMMED UP HERE.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.109
HALF THE DOCTORS
CAN'T MAKE IT,

17:47.109 --> 17:48.937
SO YOU GOTTA LET ME
GET BACK TO WORK.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.895
PAUL...

17:50.895 --> 17:52.810

I CAN DO?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.334
UH...

17:54.334 --> 17:55.335
YEAH.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.988
YOU CAN GIVE BLOOD.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.468
WE'VE GOT
A SERIOUS SHORTAGE.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.122
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
I'D BE GLAD TO.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.037
DOCTOR?

18:02.037 --> 18:04.474
DR. SEGAL ASKED IF YOU CAN
TAKE THE LACERATION IN "C."

18:04.474 --> 18:05.649
RIGHT. GOTTA GO.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.998
LOOK, TAKE DIANA UP
TO PEDIATRICS WARD

18:06.998 --> 18:08.609
AND GIVE HER
ANYTHING SHE NEEDS,

18:08.609 --> 18:10.567
AND I'LL SEND
A NURSE UP THERE
TO TAKE YOUR BLOOD.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.220
OK.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.405
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

18:24.538 --> 18:25.800
UH-UH. NO.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.282
YOU SURE?

18:29.282 --> 18:32.502
'CAUSE NOW'S
THE RIGHT TIME,

18:32.502 --> 18:34.156
CONSIDERING
WE'RE STUCK IN HERE

18:34.156 --> 18:36.202
FOR GOD KNOWS
HOW LONG.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.204
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET WHATEVER IT IS
OFF YOUR--

18:38.204 --> 18:40.641
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME,
JULE?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.643
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT?

18:42.643 --> 18:45.254
AFTER ALL THAT STUFF
THAT HAPPENED...

18:45.254 --> 18:47.996
AND A LOT OF STUFF
HAPPENED.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.346
I DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR FROM YOU.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.087
RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED.

18:52.087 --> 18:56.222
JUST TO...LET ME KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OK.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.527
I SHOULD'VE DONE THAT.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.272
I GUESS I WAS JUST,
UM...

19:05.666 --> 19:08.712
I GUESS I WAS
EMBARRASSED, GRIFFIN.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.627
OF ME?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
WELL...

19:12.194 --> 19:14.153
THE WAY THAT I WAS,

19:14.153 --> 19:17.504
THE WAY THAT YOU SAW ME,
I WAS...

19:17.504 --> 19:19.506
SO PATHETIC.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.551
I WAS SO LOST.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.162
THAT'S...

19:23.162 --> 19:27.122
SINCE WHEN
DID YOU EVER CARE
ABOUT WHAT I THOUGHT?

19:27.122 --> 19:28.732
WHAT?

19:28.732 --> 19:31.170
WHAT, YOU MEAN
TO ACTUALLY TELL ME

19:31.170 --> 19:32.823
THAT YOU
RESPECT MY OPINION

19:32.823 --> 19:34.825
WHEN YOU BLEW OFF
EVERYTHING I SAID
ABOUT NED,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.350
WHEN YOU EVEN WANTED
TO DIVORCE ME
TO SHUT ME UP?

19:37.350 --> 19:40.048
GRIFFIN, YOU WERE
SO COMPLETELY WRONG.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.224
COME ON. I'M JUST
A NUISANCE TO YOU.

19:42.224 --> 19:47.186
YOU THINK...
I'M THAT DENSE?

19:47.186 --> 19:50.189
YOU THINK
I COULD'VE MISSED
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.538
A GUY WHO CLAIMED
HE LOVED ME

19:51.538 --> 19:53.192
MADE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.195
AND A GUY WHO
CLAIMED HE DIDN'T...

19:56.195 --> 19:59.502
GOD, YOU DID
SO MUCH FOR ME.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.810
RESPECT YOU?
GRIFFIN, GOD...

20:04.551 --> 20:06.553
WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW

20:06.553 --> 20:08.424
IS SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.394
WHA--HEY!
WHAT DO YOU THINK--

20:21.394 --> 20:23.831
YOU SHOULD NOT JUST
SNEAK UP ON PEOPLE
LIKE THAT.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.572
I'M JUST SITTIN' HERE,
MAN.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.660
OH, REALLY?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.227
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE.
ADMIT IT.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.447
HEY, CLAUDIA,
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.237
OK.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.195
YOU ARE WAY TOO TENSE,
CLAUDIA.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.414
YOU GOTTA EASE UP.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.937
WHO'S TENSE?

20:42.937 --> 20:44.243
I'M EASY.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.505
YOU'RE VIBRATING,
CLAUDIA.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.289
AND YOU'RE
HANDLING IT WRONG.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.769
YOU JUST...

20:48.769 --> 20:50.814
YOU CAN'T KEEP
MAKING THEM THE ENEMY.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.294
WELL, I MEAN,
AREN'T THEY?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.514
THEY'RE JUST
SITTING THERE,
CHECKING ME OUT,

20:54.514 --> 20:56.646
JUST COPPING
FREE FEELS.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.169
BUT THEY'RE JUST FLIRTING,
YOU KNOW?

20:58.169 --> 20:59.736
THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.348
MAYBE I DON'T WANT
THEIR ATTENTION.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.307
THEN DON'T MAKE IT
SO TEMPTING, YOU KNOW?

21:05.307 --> 21:07.440
DON'T BE SO AFRAID.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.703
AFRAID.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.618
AFRAID OF WHAT?

21:13.707 --> 21:15.709
UM...

21:15.709 --> 21:17.624
I DON'T KNOW. UH...

21:17.624 --> 21:19.365
SEX?

21:19.365 --> 21:22.150
YEAH.
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
THAT I SHOULDN'T BE?

21:22.150 --> 21:24.370
UH, CAREFUL? SURE.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.067
RESPECTFUL?
GOD, MOST DEFINITELY.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.591
BUT SCARED?

21:28.591 --> 21:31.638
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF STDs OR PREGNANCY?

21:31.638 --> 21:33.640
OK, NOT BEING
SCARED OF SEX,

21:33.640 --> 21:35.642
THAT JUST
MAKES NO SENSE.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.513
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW, CLAUD.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.123
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.387
AND BELIEVE ME,
I DIDN'T KNOW, EITHER.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.346
SARAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SEX IS?

21:44.346 --> 21:46.522
I'M TURNING 16, NOT 11.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.046
SURE, YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS,
THE PHYSICAL PART AND ALL THAT,

21:49.046 --> 21:51.701
BUT, GOD, THERE'S
SO MUCH MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

21:54.878 --> 21:58.229
BOY, I WISH
ONE OF OUR MOMS
WAS HERE RIGHT NOW, HUH?

21:58.229 --> 22:00.406
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:00.406 --> 22:03.322
IF I'VE GOTTA DO THIS,
THEN...I HAVE TO DO THIS.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.235
SO...

22:12.983 --> 22:14.985
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ONE OF THESE?

22:14.985 --> 22:17.814
OH, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
SARAH, THEY'RE BAILEY'S.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.994
NO, NO.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.648
THEY'RE MINE, TOO.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.997
COME ON. WOMEN HAVE
TO BE RESPONSIBLE, TOO.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.304
IT'S NOT JUST GUYS
WHO BUY CONDOMS.

22:29.304 --> 22:32.002
I KNOW, I KNOW. LOTS OF
MY GIRLFRIENDS HAVE THEM

22:32.002 --> 22:34.004
'CAUSE...MEN?
FORGET IT.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.832
THEIR SPECIES
CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.010
OH. COME ON, GIRLFRIEND.
SIT DOWN. WE GOTTA TALK.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.190
OH, BOY.

22:48.192 --> 22:50.543
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

22:50.543 --> 22:51.195
DRIVE SAFELY.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.549
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO GET
A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.551
YES, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
WE DO.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.204
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO MY JOB

23:00.204 --> 23:01.728
WITH YOU SECOND-GUESSING
EVERY MOVE I MAKE?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.120
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE

23:03.120 --> 23:04.644
WHEN YOU PISS OFF ALL
THE PEOPLE THAT I NEED?

23:04.644 --> 23:06.472
SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THIS WOULD NEVER WORK.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.778
YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING OVER
FROM A CONTROL FREAK.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.172
A CONTROL FREAK? ME?

23:11.172 --> 23:12.565
WHO'S THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN THROUGH
3 DIFFERENT MANAGERS

23:12.565 --> 23:14.088
IN THAT MANY WEEKS?

23:14.088 --> 23:16.307
WHO'S THE ONE
WITH THE 90 POINT
MANAGEMENT PLAN?

23:16.307 --> 23:18.962
YOU ARE, ONLY YOU WON'T
TELL ANYONE WHAT IT IS

23:18.962 --> 23:21.182
BECAUSE, GOD FORBID,
YOU COULD EVER BE REPLACED.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.923
I WANT TO BE REPLACED!

23:22.923 --> 23:24.185
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT!

23:24.185 --> 23:26.883
THEN PROVE IT. GET OUT.
LET ME DO YOUR JOB.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.319
I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE SURE

23:28.319 --> 23:29.930
MY RESTAURANT'S
IN GOOD HANDS, OK?

23:29.930 --> 23:32.933
THIS IS MY NAME
ON THE GLASS
OVER HERE.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.936
THIS IS MY NAME
ON THE MATCHBOOKS, OK?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.116
YOU'LL FIND
THE DAY'S RECEIPTS
AND CREDIT CARD VOUCHERS

23:42.116 --> 23:43.813
IN THE CASH BOX.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.989
TIMECARDS AND FOOD ORDERS
ARE POSTED IN THE KITCHEN.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.034
WHERE YOU GOING?

23:47.034 --> 23:48.078
HOME.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.472
WE STILL HAVE FOOD
TO PACK UP HERE.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.473
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.474
I AM.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.867
GOOD-BYE.

23:53.867 --> 23:54.911
I QUIT.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.971
SO IT'S MORE THAN CONDOMS,
CLAUD.

24:13.887 --> 24:19.153
BEING REALLY SAFE MEANS
BEING WITH SOMEONE
YOU TOTALLY TRUST,

24:19.153 --> 24:23.723
EVEN IF THAT MEANS
WAITING YEARS AND YEARS.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.551
I WAITED YEARS AND YEARS...

24:25.551 --> 24:28.075
AND YEARS.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.077
DOES ANY OF THIS
MAKE SENSE?

24:30.077 --> 24:32.819
YEAH, YEAH, FOR SURE.
IT'S JUST...

24:32.819 --> 24:35.430
WHY AM I SO SCARED?

24:35.430 --> 24:39.565
WELL, 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.957
AND THAT'S THE THING.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.612
WHEN YOU FEEL
THAT IT'S TIME,

24:43.612 --> 24:47.573
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE
WHEN YOU FEEL RIGHT

24:47.573 --> 24:49.226
AND HE FEELS RIGHT

24:49.226 --> 24:51.402
AND THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING
TO BE SCARED OF ANYMORE.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.626
AND THAT'S WHY
ALL THOSE GUYS OUT THERE,

24:57.626 --> 25:00.586
THEY ARE NOTHING
TO GET ALL NERVOUS ABOUT

25:00.586 --> 25:03.066
OR TO BE SCARED OF.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.592
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.941
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

25:07.941 --> 25:09.464
Beaver: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THERE, HUH?

25:09.464 --> 25:12.511
WHAT IS IT WITH
CHICKS AND BATHROOMS?

25:19.430 --> 25:22.651
WE WERE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE GIRL TALK. WHY?

25:22.651 --> 25:25.175
NOTHING. JUST, UH...
FREDDIE OVER THERE,

25:25.175 --> 25:26.612
HE WANTS TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.267
YOU KNOW, CLAUD,
TALK TO HIM.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
TALK TO HIM.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.055
YEAH. TALK TO HIM.
SURE.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.760
NO. NO, I WOULDN'T.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.371
I'D LEAVE RIGHT NOW
AND COME HOME.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.112
IT'S JUST THEY SAID
THE ALARM WON'T WORK

25:49.112 --> 25:50.984
UNTIL THE POWER'S BACK ON.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.117
YOU KNOW WHAT, SARAH?

25:54.117 --> 25:58.078
I CAN JUST
BLOW THIS OFF AND...

25:58.078 --> 26:00.123
REALLY?

26:00.123 --> 26:03.300
YOU SURE?
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE OK.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.955
OK. YEAH. I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER. BYE.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.139
WHAT, YOU THINK OF
SOME MORE NAMES TO CALL ME?

26:16.139 --> 26:20.448
YEAH, I DID, BUT
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.145
YEAH, WELL,
MAKE IT QUICK.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.191
I GOT A TON OF FOOD
TO TAKE CARE OF.

26:26.759 --> 26:30.153
I CAME HERE TO SAY...

26:30.153 --> 26:31.285
YOU WERE RIGHT.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.158
I'M SORRY?

26:35.158 --> 26:36.856
NOT ABOUT EVERYTHING.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.032
NOT ABOUT MOST OF IT,
ACTUALLY.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.775
ABOUT ME, THOUGH.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.559
YES, I ADMIT IT.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.430
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.568
ALL MY LIFE, I...

26:53.568 --> 26:56.963
I'VE DRIVEN OFF FAMILY,

26:56.963 --> 26:57.877
EMPLOYERS...

27:01.184 --> 27:02.969
BOYFRIENDS.

27:05.449 --> 27:09.758
THE SCARIEST THING IS
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENS.

27:09.758 --> 27:14.154
I TRY AND I TRY TO...

27:14.154 --> 27:16.765
SOLVE ALL OF
THEIR PROBLEMS,

27:16.765 --> 27:18.767
AND THEN SOMEHOW,

27:18.767 --> 27:22.031
SOMEWHERE
I CROSS THIS LINE.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.427
AND SUDDENLY,
I AM THE PROBLEM.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.738
LIKE WITH YOU TODAY.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.523
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

27:35.523 --> 27:37.394
NO, I DO.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.961
I HAVE TO SAY IT.

27:41.355 --> 27:42.617
HI.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.098
MY NAME IS LAUREN,

27:45.098 --> 27:46.795

27:49.102 --> 27:50.843

27:52.888 --> 27:55.108
WELL...

27:55.108 --> 27:56.370
OK.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.290
OK.

28:03.290 --> 28:06.293
I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS, THEN.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.816

OF HAUTE CUISINE
IS GONNA BE LANDFILL.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.841
UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO

28:32.841 --> 28:34.930
BECAUSE AT C.F.A.

28:34.930 --> 28:38.151
WE'LL NEVER TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.848
I'LL HAVE THE SALMON...

28:39.848 --> 28:41.632
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.901
FEEL FUNNY
TO BE BACK HERE?

28:48.901 --> 28:51.251
THIS FLOOR,
WE CONVERTED IT
RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.861
USED TO BE YOUR FLOOR.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.907
YEAH. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.910
JUST KEEP THINKING
THAT IT ALL STARTED HERE.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.913
I MET DAPHNE THROUGH KEVIN,
AND THAT'S HOW DIANA HAPPENED,

29:00.913 --> 29:02.784
AND NOW IT'S
JUST THE 2 OF US.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.438

29:04.438 --> 29:06.135
IT ISN'T JUST
THE 2 OF YOU, CHARLIE.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.094
NO. I KNOW.

29:08.094 --> 29:12.359
I WAS ALSO THINKING
THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND
WHEN I WAS HERE.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.448
KIRSTEN WAS A FRIEND.
I WAS JUST A DOCTOR.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.928
NO. YOU WERE A FRIEND.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.451
AND, UH...

29:17.451 --> 29:20.454
THE WAY THINGS FELL OUT
WITH YOU AND KIRSTEN,

29:50.527 --> 29:52.051

29:52.051 --> 29:54.183

AND REALLY DIRTY.

29:56.316 --> 29:59.232

NEXT WEEK.

31:40.942 --> 31:41.943
YEAH.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.512
RIGHT.

31:45.512 --> 31:49.603
YOU KNOW WHAT? I ALWAYS TRY
TO THINK OF THE THING THAT
I'D NEVER WANT TO GIVE AWAY

31:49.603 --> 31:51.257
AND THEN GIVE THAT.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.999
YOU JUST KNOW IT'S GOT TO
MEAN A LOT TO THE PERSON

31:53.999 --> 31:58.220
'CAUSE IT MEANT
A LOT TO YOU.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.919
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

32:00.919 --> 32:05.924
LIKE THE HOCKEY PUCK
I GOT SIGNED BY GRETZKY
AFTER THE '94 STANLEY CUP?

32:07.969 --> 32:10.015
OR DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER IDEAS?

32:10.015 --> 32:12.452
I DON'T KNOW.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.670
DO YOU HAVE ANY?

32:15.934 --> 32:16.935
HMM.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.197
LET'S THINK.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.335
SO...

32:26.335 --> 32:27.858
SWEET 16, HUH?

32:33.864 --> 32:37.129
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED
HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES
I'VE MANAGED.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.088
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE ALL
REALLY NICE PLACES.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.307
CAN YOU PASS
THE EGGPLANT?

32:41.307 --> 32:43.744
NEVER FOR MORE THAN
2 YEARS, THOUGH.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.050
TRADE YOU
FOR THE SCAMPI.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.486
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

32:46.486 --> 32:48.096
I DON'T KNOW.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.446
YOU NEED A KNEW CHALLENGE
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN?

32:50.446 --> 32:53.101
YEAH. I NEED
A NEW ADDRESS.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.234
I NEED TO FIND
A NEW PLACE TO GO

32:55.234 --> 32:58.193
WHERE EVERYONE
DOESN'T WANT TO KILL ME.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.890
YOU AND ME BOTH.

32:59.890 --> 33:03.198
OH, COME ON. YOU?
MR. MAN OF THE PEOPLE?

33:04.721 --> 33:07.159
MR. BILLION DOLLAR
DIMPLES?

33:07.159 --> 33:09.378
YOU NEVER MET
MY OLDER BROTHER.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.250
THE ONE YOU HAD
A FIGHT WITH?

33:11.250 --> 33:13.034
YUP.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.994
WASN'T THAT JUST ABOUT
THE KID'S DYSLEXIA?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.256
THAT WASN'T ABOUT
CONTROL.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.911
OR WAS IT?

33:23.958 --> 33:27.570
YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS,

33:27.570 --> 33:29.920
"OH, BAILEY TAKES CARE
OF EVERYTHING."

33:29.920 --> 33:31.835
AND...AND THAT'S TRUE.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.926
BUT...

33:35.926 --> 33:37.972
WHY IS THAT?

33:37.972 --> 33:40.409
I MEAN, REALLY.

33:40.409 --> 33:44.152
IS IT BECAUSE I'M
SUCH A WONDERFUL GUY OR...

33:44.152 --> 33:47.590
OR IS IT BECAUSE
I'M SO SURE I'LL DO IT
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE

33:47.590 --> 33:52.160
AND I'M SO SURE
THE REST OF THE WORLD
WILL GET IT WRONG?

33:52.160 --> 33:54.641
HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR.

33:58.166 --> 34:03.041
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I CAN'T
KEEP A BOYFRIEND.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.087
OR MAYBE
IT'S MY OVERBITE.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.828
YOU DON'T HAVE
AN OVERBITE.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.960
OH? DAMN.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.705
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

34:15.705 --> 34:17.664
CAN YOU KEEP
A GIRLFRIEND?

34:17.664 --> 34:20.362
SO FAR, YEAH.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.451
SO YOU'RE...

34:22.451 --> 34:24.062
YEAH.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.585
SARAH.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.890
HER NAME'S SARAH.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.632
OH.

34:29.632 --> 34:33.375
SO, HEY, THERE'S HOPE
FOR THE REST OF US
CONTROL FREAKS.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.811
[CHUCKLES]

34:46.823 --> 34:47.911
WAIT.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.348
CAN WE...

34:49.348 --> 34:52.916
LIKE, CAN WE
JUST THINK?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.875
WHY?

34:54.875 --> 34:57.704
WHY DO WE HAVE TO THINK?

34:57.704 --> 35:02.622
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.324
STOP WORRYING.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.935
GRIFFIN, NO ONE NEEDS
PROTECTING ANYMORE.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.127
[LAUGHTER]

35:29.127 --> 35:32.217
I AM REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY FULL.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.218
COME ON.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.567
NO.

35:34.567 --> 35:35.698
THERE'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT LEFT.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.265
I'M GONNA EXPLODE.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.658
THERE'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT LEFT.
NO.

35:38.658 --> 35:39.528
COME ON.
NO.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.139
COME ON--OOH!

35:41.139 --> 35:42.357
WHAT, YOU SPILLED?
OH, NO.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.621
YOU BUMPED MY HAND.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.667
RASPBERRY SAUCE ON
MY BRAND-NEW SILK BLOUSE.

35:47.667 --> 35:50.496
DON'T WORRY.
LITTLE CLUB SODA
WILL GET IT RIGHT OUT.

35:50.496 --> 35:51.671
HURRY BEFORE IT SOAKS IN.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.934
ALL RIGHT.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.982
CAN'T SEE HERE.

35:58.982 --> 35:59.896
YOU MIND?

36:05.337 --> 36:06.599
OK.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.166
IT'S COMIN'.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.040
ALMOST...

36:13.040 --> 36:13.823
ALMOST.

36:27.576 --> 36:28.577
THE LIGHTS!

36:28.577 --> 36:30.100
UH-HUH.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.363
THE LIGHTS ARE BACK.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.366
UM...

36:36.759 --> 36:39.240
I SHOULD MAKE SURE
THE ALARM'S WORKING OK.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.242
YEAH. I'LL CHECK
THE COMPUTER,

36:41.242 --> 36:42.287
MAKE SURE WE'RE BACK
ONLINE.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.462
GOOD.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.638
THAT IS...

36:45.638 --> 36:48.336
ASSUMING
I STILL WORK HERE.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.338
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
WORK HERE?

36:50.338 --> 36:52.427
THE QUITTING PART BEFORE?

36:52.427 --> 36:53.689
OH.

36:53.689 --> 36:54.429
FORGET THAT.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.344
THAT'S...

36:56.344 --> 37:01.131
LIGHTS GO OFF,
PEOPLE DO ALL KINDS
OF CRAZY STUFF.

37:02.698 --> 37:03.699
AHEM.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.310
OK.OK.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.494
UM, HEY, UH...

37:17.278 --> 37:20.847
COULD YOU GIVE THIS
TO CLAUDIA FOR ME?

37:20.847 --> 37:22.849
WHY? YOU DON'T
WANNA STAY?

37:22.849 --> 37:26.113
IT FEELS KIND OF WEIRD.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.897
GRIFFIN, STAY.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.812
I'D LIKE YOU
TO STAY.

37:29.812 --> 37:31.901
JUST COME IN FOR--

37:31.901 --> 37:33.512
HEY, YOU TWO.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.209
HEY.

37:35.209 --> 37:38.212
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
WE JUST GOT...

37:38.212 --> 37:40.954
YOU KNOW, STUCK
IN THE ELEVATOR.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.696
OH. YOU GUYS OK?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE
SHAKEN UP.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.088
NO, NO.
NO. WE'RE FINE.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.351
WE'RE OK.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.101
CHARLIE!

37:58.101 --> 37:59.102
HEY.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.365
HOLD ON A SECOND.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.062
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA SAY TO YOU.

38:02.062 --> 38:05.413
YEAH, YOU STARTED TO SAY
SOMETHING EARLIER, AND THEN--

38:05.413 --> 38:07.197
YOU AND KIRSTEN
BELONG TOGETHER.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.767
WHAT?
RIGHT.

38:11.767 --> 38:14.814
I KNOW. THE LAST
PERSON YOU EXPECT
TO HEAR THIS FROM.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.599
NO. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR TRUE.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.079
LOOK, I KNOW
A COUPLE THINGS
ABOUT KIRSTEN.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.037
I WAS HER HUSBAND,
AND I KNOW STUFF
EVEN YOU DON'T KNOW.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.430
THEN YOU KNOW THAT
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER,

38:22.430 --> 38:24.040
ALL I DID WAS
MAKE HER UNHAPPY.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.434
AND ALL SHE WANTS TO DO
IS MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE,

38:26.434 --> 38:28.697
SO LET ME JUST
REASSURE YOU--

38:28.697 --> 38:31.961
REASSURE ME?
CHARLIE, IT'S NOT EASY
SAYING THIS,

38:31.961 --> 38:34.181
BUT FOR HER,
YOU GOTTA HEAR ME OUT.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.099
I AM THE BIGGEST IDIOT
YOU EVER SAW

38:39.099 --> 38:42.798
BECAUSE I SHOULD'VE
SEEN IT COMING FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.800
WHEN KIRSTEN
WERE FIRST TOGETHER,

38:44.800 --> 38:47.194
I MEAN, YOU WERE
ALL WE TALKED ABOUT.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.457
ME?

38:49.457 --> 38:50.806
HOW YOU HATED
TO LET EACH OTHER GO,

38:50.806 --> 38:52.460
BUT IT WAS REALLY
FOR THE BEST,

38:52.460 --> 38:55.811
HOW BECAUSE OF ME
SHE COULD STOP
OBSESSING ABOUT YOU.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.944
I MEAN, WE ACTUALLY
TALKED ABOUT THAT.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.815
I'M SORRY, BUT--

38:59.815 --> 39:02.209
NO. IT WAS ME.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.907
I TOLD MYSELF THAT I WAS
HELPING HER GET AWAY
FROM YOU,

39:04.907 --> 39:08.084
BUT IT WAS YOU
ALL ALONG.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.912
YOU WERE WHERE
SHE WAS HEADED,

39:09.912 --> 39:12.132
AND YOU WHERE
SHE'S HEADING NOW.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.657
LISTEN, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, BUT THERE IS...

39:15.657 --> 39:17.572
THERE'S NO WAY.

39:17.572 --> 39:21.141
CHARLIE, YOU KEEP SAYING
YOU'RE ALONE NOW,

39:21.141 --> 39:22.534
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

39:24.318 --> 39:26.625
JUST...

39:26.625 --> 39:28.278
THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

39:43.555 --> 39:44.425
BAILEY!

39:46.558 --> 39:47.820
SARAH.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.822
I AM SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

39:49.822 --> 39:50.823
WHO CARES?
YOU MADE IT.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.477
EVERYBODY'S OK HERE?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.217
NOBODY TRIPPED OR FELL
OR GOT HURT OR ANYTHING?

39:54.217 --> 39:55.349
NO. WE'RE FINE.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.832
WHAT? HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T PUT THAT
BIRTHDAY BANNER UP?

39:59.832 --> 40:01.050
I SPENT HOURS
ON THAT THING.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.879
UH, BAILEY,
THERE WAS A BLACKOUT.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.315
I KIND OF HAD
OTHER THINGS
TO DEAL WITH.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.882
YEAH, BUT SOMEBODY ELSE
COULD'VE PUT IT UP.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.932
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT. FORGET IT.
I'M SORRY.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.673
I'M SORRY.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.458
I MUST BE
OUT OF MY MIND.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.208
GRIFFIN.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.210
GRIFFIN!
HEY.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.864
YOU ACTUALLY
DECIDED TO SHOW.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.126
YEAH, I DID.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.171
HEY, BIRTHDAY GIRL.
HEY.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.912
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS?

40:38.784 --> 40:41.308
UM, WHERE'S THAT
CD PLAYER, CLAUD?

40:41.308 --> 40:43.049
UH, IT'S OVER THERE.

40:45.181 --> 40:47.532
SO, WHO ARE
ALL THESE BOYS?

40:47.532 --> 40:48.750
HMM.

40:51.797 --> 40:52.798
Owen: CHARLIE!

40:52.798 --> 40:54.147
HEY, BUDDY.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.191
HEY.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.803
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YA.

40:57.803 --> 40:59.152
I REALLY,
REALLY MISSED YA.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.153
SORRY I'M LATE.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.635
HEY, YOU GUYS.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.898
HEY.
HEY, DIANA. HI.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.076
I GOT MY DATE

41:10.076 --> 41:11.730

THIS PRETTY OUTFIT?

41:14.646 --> 41:15.951
WHAT?

41:15.951 --> 41:17.387
NOTHING. IT'S JUST...

41:17.387 --> 41:19.868
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
THAT'S ALL.

41:19.868 --> 41:22.915
WELL, DON'T EXPECT
TO SEE EITHER OF US
THIS EVENING

41:22.915 --> 41:24.569
'CAUSE ME AND DIANA,

41:24.569 --> 41:26.658
WE GOT A LOTTA
CATCHING UP TO DO,

41:26.658 --> 41:28.094

41:38.496 --> 41:41.499
YOU EVER SOMETIMES WISH
YOU WERE 16 AGAIN?

41:46.199 --> 41:47.896
I KNOW I DO,

41:47.896 --> 41:52.205
SO THE WHOLE GROWNUP WORLD
CAN JUST GO AWAY.

WELL, COULD YOU

42:06.393 --> 42:08.047
PLEASE, FOR TONIGHT?

42:20.842 --> 42:22.409
HEY, YOU GOT ANY JUICE

OWEN LOOKS GOOD.

42:36.728 --> 42:37.990

42:37.990 --> 42:40.383
I THINK HE NEEDS

42:40.383 --> 42:41.994
GOTTA GET HIM OUTSIDE

42:41.994 --> 42:44.344

YOU CAN SEE IT.

42:45.737 --> 42:46.738

42:46.738 --> 42:48.348
YEAH.

42:48.348 --> 42:49.610
WELL, THANKS.

42:51.656 --> 42:54.354
LOOKS LIKE CLAUD'S GOT
A BUNCH OF NEW FRIENDS.

42:54.354 --> 42:55.268

43:07.541 --> 43:08.542

43:08.542 --> 43:10.370
FEELING ANY OLDER YET?

43:10.370 --> 43:13.199
OLDER. UH...

43:13.199 --> 43:15.331
WELL, MIKEY,
THE SWEET ONE,

43:15.331 --> 43:18.030
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
HE ASKED ME IF I'D WANT
TO DRIVE OUT TO THE OVERLOOK.

43:18.030 --> 43:19.509
YOU KNOW, PARK.

43:19.509 --> 43:22.251
OH, MY GOD.

43:22.251 --> 43:25.472
I SAID HE'D HAVE
TO CALL ME BACK
IN A YEAR OR 2.

43:25.472 --> 43:27.039
GOOD.
