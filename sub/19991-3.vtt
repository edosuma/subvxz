<i>- All right, Krusty crew.</i>

01:07.266 --> 01:08.498
I want to remind you all

01:08.500 --> 01:12.235
that you're representing
the Krusty Krab--

01:12.237 --> 01:13.703
the greasiest greasy spoon

01:13.705 --> 01:16.139
you'll ever have the privilege
of serving!

01:16.141 --> 01:18.208
- Whoo!
You tell 'em, Mr. Krabs.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.179
Bring it around town!
Yeah!

01:24.216 --> 01:26.783
Bring it around somewhere!

01:26.785 --> 01:28.819
Open the doors

01:28.821 --> 01:31.354
and let the consuming
commence!

01:31.356 --> 01:34.724
I'll be in me office
polishing yesterday's booty.

01:36.295 --> 01:37.761
"I'll be in me office

01:37.763 --> 01:39.463
polishing
yesterday's booty."

01:42.634 --> 01:45.502
- I heard that,
Mr. Squidward!

01:45.703 --> 01:47.671
- It wasn't an insult,
Mr. Krabs.

01:47.673 --> 01:50.540
It was a--a--a--a tribute.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.409
Haven't you ever heard
of "imitation is

01:52.411 --> 01:55.378
the sincerest form
of flattery"?

01:55.380 --> 01:57.714
- You trying to tell me
that was a "complerment"?

01:57.716 --> 02:03.653
- Exactly, it's my homage
to you and your love of money.

02:04.456 --> 02:05.422
Well, you got me there.

02:05.424 --> 02:07.190
I do love money.

02:07.192 --> 02:10.193
Excellent observation,
Mr. Squidward.

02:12.263 --> 02:14.197
- Oh, boy,
that was a close one.

02:14.199 --> 02:17.901
- Yes, it was
a very close one, Squidward.

02:17.903 --> 02:20.237
Close and warm.

02:20.239 --> 02:23.340
Mr. Krabs was really flattered
by your imitation.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.909
- Already forgot about it.

02:26.511 --> 02:31.581
Imitation plus flattery
equals happy people.

02:36.955 --> 02:40.557
- Whoa, okay.
Everybody, come on now.

02:40.559 --> 02:43.560
Settle down,
time to eat your patties.

02:43.562 --> 02:44.794
Whoa, okay now.

02:44.796 --> 02:48.632
Everybody, settle down.
Time to eat your patties.

02:48.634 --> 02:49.499
Huh?

02:50.936 --> 02:53.470
- Wow, that's just like me.

02:56.341 --> 02:58.875
I said eat your patties!

02:59.877 --> 03:00.744
Hurry up, SpongeBob,

03:00.746 --> 03:03.647
I need two double orders
of Krabby Krust stat.

03:03.649 --> 03:05.882
- No problem, Squidward,
I'll get you those orders

03:05.884 --> 03:06.750
as soon as possible.

03:06.752 --> 03:09.719
Or never,
whichever comes first.

03:12.357 --> 03:13.356
Oh, swoon.

03:13.358 --> 03:16.259
That imitation stuff
really works.

03:16.261 --> 03:16.927
Look out, world!

03:16.929 --> 03:20.497
I'm gonna flatter
your socks off.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.935
Hmm. Nope.

03:24.937 --> 03:26.636
Ah.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.910
Hey, there,
Patrick old buddy.

03:33.912 --> 03:34.544
- What?

03:34.546 --> 03:36.479
Oh, hi, Patrick.
What's shaking?

03:36.481 --> 03:39.049
- I'm gonna eat ice cream
and go jellyfishing

03:39.051 --> 03:41.618
with my good buddy
SpongeBob.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.853
- Sounds good to me, "me."

03:43.855 --> 03:46.923
- Ah, it's just me. Patrick.
Fooled ya.

03:48.994 --> 03:50.961
You can't fool me, "me."

03:50.963 --> 03:53.563
That's the worst
SpongeBob impression

03:53.565 --> 03:54.764
I've ever seen.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.868
Wait, what?

04:02.608 --> 04:05.375
Rook to king four.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.981
Check-mate.

04:11.482 --> 04:13.650
- Plankton, maybe
we should play a game

04:13.652 --> 04:15.051
that's a little less dangerous.

04:15.053 --> 04:17.887
You're flatter
than hammered horse hockey.

04:20.057 --> 04:21.625
Cattywampus, Plankton.

04:21.627 --> 04:26.463
You're just about the teeniest
gal-dang critter I ever did see.

04:26.465 --> 04:27.931
Yee-haw!

04:28.132 --> 04:29.532
And you are the fuzziest

04:29.534 --> 04:32.669
nut-eating scientist
I've ever seen.

04:33.705 --> 04:35.872
I like to use science
for good.

04:35.874 --> 04:39.743
Really?
I always use science for evil!

04:40.612 --> 04:43.880
That is me to a Texas "T,"
SpongeBob.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.915
He nailed you too,
Plankton.

04:45.917 --> 04:46.750
- It was okay.

04:46.752 --> 04:50.120
He got my face right,
but that voice is terrible.

04:50.122 --> 04:54.024
- Oh, those impressions are
making everyone so happy,

04:54.026 --> 04:55.525
I can't stop doing them.

04:55.527 --> 04:57.894
I can't. I won't.

04:57.896 --> 04:58.728
Meow.

04:58.730 --> 05:01.464
80,000 impressions later.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.800
<i>Would you
please stop imitating me?</i>

05:03.802 --> 05:06.703
<i>It is starting to get</i>
<i>very annoying.</i>

05:09.107 --> 05:11.941
- Uh, can I have
some extra napkins please?

05:11.943 --> 05:15.145
Oh, you
want some extra napkins, please?

05:15.147 --> 05:17.747
- Stop it!
Stop imitating me!

05:17.749 --> 05:22.585
For the love of Neptune,
shut your talented mouth!

05:22.587 --> 05:23.987
- Okay, bye.

05:23.989 --> 05:26.489
Yup, everybody
still loves it.

05:31.729 --> 05:33.663
Are we having fun yet,

05:33.665 --> 05:35.098
Squidward Tentacles?

05:36.068 --> 05:38.068
- Oh, that's it.
I can't stand

05:38.070 --> 05:40.470
that perfect impression
of me anymore!

05:40.472 --> 05:41.705
I never thought
I'd say this,

05:41.707 --> 05:44.407
but I'm tired of looking
at myself.

05:44.409 --> 05:46.743
I quit!

05:47.678 --> 05:50.480
- Boy, SpongeBob is
really getting out of control

05:50.482 --> 05:52.949
with his impression
obsession.

05:53.951 --> 05:54.517
Ah!

05:54.519 --> 05:55.819
- Right you are,
Sandy.

05:55.821 --> 05:58.588
SpongeBob has lost touch
with reality.

05:58.590 --> 05:59.456
I've seen it before.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.025
They call it:
the "mocking mimicry madness."

06:02.027 --> 06:05.662
The mocking mimicry madness.

06:07.466 --> 06:09.466
- Oh, oh, oh!

06:09.468 --> 06:10.667
- Huh! Oh.

06:12.636 --> 06:15.705
- All right, remember guys,
this is an intervention,

06:15.707 --> 06:17.807
so we need to make sure
that above all,

06:17.809 --> 06:20.844
SpongeBob knows how much
we all care about him.

06:20.846 --> 06:24.547
- Why don't we just destroy him
and get it over with?

06:24.549 --> 06:25.215
- Here here.

06:25.217 --> 06:27.851
- You leave
my best friend alone!

06:27.853 --> 06:30.019
It was just
a suggestion.

06:30.021 --> 06:30.920
- Spread out!

06:30.922 --> 06:36.459
All right, you scurvy dogs,
SpongeBob needs us,

06:36.461 --> 06:40.163
and more importantly,
I need him--

06:40.165 --> 06:42.832
to stop imitating
me customers!

06:42.834 --> 06:47.203
- Right guys, that's...
almost...the spirit.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.539
- Oh, boy,
someone's at the door.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.708
I can't wait
to imitate 'em.

06:51.710 --> 06:52.776
Oh, hello, Patrick.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.245
And Sandy?
And Squidward?

06:55.247 --> 06:57.714
And Mr. Krabs?
Plankton too?

06:57.716 --> 07:02.152
Five at once, huh?
Okay, here goes nothing.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.857
Hi. Hi. Howdy.
Greetings. Go away.

07:07.859 --> 07:09.826
- Ugh.
- Why?

07:09.828 --> 07:12.829
- Hi, SpongeBob.
We need to talk.

07:12.831 --> 07:16.132
- Why sure. Aye. Love to.
About what? Who cares?

07:16.134 --> 07:19.602
- You know, It's okay to be
yourself, SpongeBob.

07:19.604 --> 07:22.038
- I'm-a trying, Sandy,
I'm-a trying.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.072
- You can do it,
SpongeBob.

07:23.074 --> 07:26.776
just concentrate, and it'll
all come back to ya.

07:32.284 --> 07:35.218
- Good morning, Gary.
Meow. Duh!

07:35.220 --> 07:37.821
Me money!

07:37.823 --> 07:39.989
Karate chop! Ha!

07:39.991 --> 07:42.058
I went to college!

07:42.060 --> 07:44.894
I said,
eat your patties!

07:44.896 --> 07:45.995
I can't do it!

07:45.997 --> 07:49.098
I'm a freak!
A freak!

07:49.100 --> 07:51.000
I'm a freak!

07:51.002 --> 07:52.202
- Hey!

07:57.909 --> 08:00.310

08:06.051 --> 08:11.321

SpongeBob?

09:34.673 --> 09:37.407
How many fingers
am I holding up?

09:37.975 --> 09:39.976
B.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.911
- Good, SpongeBob,
I had the same answer.

09:41.913 --> 09:45.348
- I know you're in there
somewhere, SquarePants.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.885
- We're sorry,
the person you are calling--

09:48.887 --> 09:49.852
SpongeBob SquarePants--

09:49.854 --> 09:52.789
has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.825
- Okay, guys, SpongeBob imitates
whoever he hears,

09:55.827 --> 10:00.296
so we've all got to imitate him
to help him remember who he is.

10:00.298 --> 10:01.831
This should help.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.866
- Hey!

10:04.970 --> 10:07.003
Mmm! Mmm!

10:09.740 --> 10:11.407
Ah! Hold still,
you little rascal!

10:11.409 --> 10:13.443
- No!

10:14.812 --> 10:17.413
What a great idea.

10:17.415 --> 10:19.082
Ugh!

10:19.283 --> 10:22.352
I'm a square and yellow critter!

10:23.188 --> 10:26.923
I like cooking with lard!

10:30.227 --> 10:32.195
Mr. Krabs is the best boss

10:32.197 --> 10:35.231
in the whole ocean.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.233
Oop! Sorry.
I mean--

10:37.235 --> 10:39.736
Uh--

10:39.738 --> 10:42.705
I forgot the secret
Krabby Patty formula,

10:42.707 --> 10:45.308
Mr. K.
Would you remind me again?

10:45.310 --> 10:48.811
- Sure, SpongeBob,
I got it right--

10:48.813 --> 10:52.482
Oh, no, you don't,
Plankton.

10:53.350 --> 10:56.719
That was a pretty good
impression, though.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.022
- Thanks.

11:01.793 --> 11:02.892
It's not working,
fellers!

11:02.894 --> 11:05.161
We need to combine our efforts
and do an impression

11:05.163 --> 11:07.797
of SpongeBob
all at the same time.

11:07.799 --> 11:08.598
Okay, all together now.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.935
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

11:19.443 --> 11:22.111
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

11:22.113 --> 11:23.746
I'm ready!

11:23.748 --> 11:26.349
I remember.
I know who I am.

11:26.351 --> 11:28.184
I am SpongeBob SquarePants,

11:28.186 --> 11:32.155
and yes, I do like
cooking with lard.

11:33.158 --> 11:34.991
Thanks, guys,
you're the best friends

11:34.993 --> 11:36.526
a guy with memory loss
could have.

11:36.528 --> 11:38.928
It sure feels great
to just be yourself.

11:38.930 --> 11:42.131
Doesn't it, guys?
Guys?

11:42.399 --> 11:44.100
Oh, no!

11:44.102 --> 11:47.437
Now they have
mocking mimicry madness.

11:49.841 --> 11:52.008
- Let me out!
Let me out!

12:14.264 --> 12:16.065
- Ooh! Oh!

12:22.306 --> 12:24.140
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:25.642 --> 12:27.276
- Hi.

12:27.278 --> 12:29.979
Gary, I feel funny inside.

12:34.251 --> 12:36.486
- Yow!

12:37.254 --> 12:38.254
Hello.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.926
- Gary, there's something
inside of me.

12:43.928 --> 12:44.894
- Meow.

12:44.896 --> 12:46.629
- You see anything?

12:54.204 --> 12:56.105
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Oh!

12:58.408 --> 13:01.144
- Gary the Snail,
is that any way

13:01.146 --> 13:03.579
to treat
an uninvited guest?

13:03.581 --> 13:06.182
Oh, hello.

13:06.184 --> 13:08.050
Ooh! That tickles.

13:08.052 --> 13:08.918
More like prickles.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.321
Hey, I think I'll call you
Prickles.

13:13.591 --> 13:16.092
I see you.

13:21.266 --> 13:22.632
Okay, okay.

13:22.634 --> 13:25.968
Enough's enough. It's time
for you to go, little guy.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.570
I already have a pet--
Gary.

13:27.572 --> 13:30.706
I'm afraid I just don't need
another one.

13:37.481 --> 13:40.516
Whew.

13:40.518 --> 13:42.351
- Aw, stop, stop!

13:42.353 --> 13:46.589
Oh, Gary, I don't like to hear
the little guy cry.

13:46.591 --> 13:48.524
- Meow.

13:53.497 --> 13:55.398
- Such a sad story.

13:57.068 --> 14:00.469
- Okay, little buddy,
but just for one night.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.641
- Nighty night,
Prickles.

14:20.757 --> 14:21.490
- Huh?

14:37.675 --> 14:41.210
- Wow, a house party
going on of inside me.

14:41.212 --> 14:42.645
Hey, why wasn't I invited?

14:42.647 --> 14:44.046
I guess I was,

14:44.048 --> 14:45.014
since I am the house.

14:45.016 --> 14:48.718
Look, Gary, now we have tons
of prickly new friends.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.419
- Meow, meow.

14:50.421 --> 14:53.356
- Wup-poo. Wup-poo. Wup-poo.

14:55.092 --> 14:58.728
Wup-poo. Wup-poo.
Wup-poo. Wup-poo.

15:04.235 --> 15:04.901
Oh, my gosh!

15:04.903 --> 15:06.335
I completely lost
all track of time.

15:06.337 --> 15:07.737
Hey, uh, sorry to be
a party pooper, guys,

15:07.739 --> 15:11.207
but I've gotta take a shower
and get ready for work.

15:13.478 --> 15:16.812
Guys?
Guy--guys?

15:18.283 --> 15:21.317
- Gary, calm down.
We're all friends here.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.291
- Ow!

15:29.327 --> 15:33.396
Open up, Gary.
I'm still in my underwear.

15:34.197 --> 15:37.233
Gary, I need to take
a shower.

15:37.235 --> 15:38.701
Oh!

15:42.806 --> 15:45.474
- I did not need
to see that!

15:45.476 --> 15:47.410
Ugh!

15:50.380 --> 15:50.913
Ahh!

15:50.915 --> 15:53.215
All right, I guess you guys
will just have to stay

15:53.217 --> 15:54.083
and go to work with me.

15:54.085 --> 15:57.720
Just keep a low profile
or I could lose my job.

15:59.157 --> 16:02.258
- Eh, SpongeBob.
Did ya clean out the--

16:02.260 --> 16:04.460
Sweet Dutchman's ghost!

16:04.462 --> 16:07.630
When's the last time
you took a bath, boy-o?

16:07.632 --> 16:08.731
You're riddled with vermin.

16:08.733 --> 16:12.301
- I-I d-d-don't know
what you mean, sir.

16:19.243 --> 16:22.411
- If customers find out
you're touching patties

16:22.413 --> 16:24.246
with your wormy hands,

16:24.248 --> 16:27.717
the health department will
shut us down for sure.

16:27.719 --> 16:28.884
- I understand, sir.

16:28.886 --> 16:31.354
Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me
for a second?

16:31.356 --> 16:32.555
Prickles, you heard
my boss.

16:32.557 --> 16:34.423
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you

16:34.425 --> 16:37.626
and your friends to leave,
please.

16:40.497 --> 16:42.164
"Squatters rights"?

16:42.166 --> 16:44.266
What the heck is
squatters rights?

16:44.268 --> 16:46.502
- Oh, they're "lawyering" up,
boy-o.

16:46.504 --> 16:49.672
They're makin' a legal claim
to keep living in your body.

16:49.674 --> 16:53.309
- It's okay, Mr. Krabs,
they're not hurting me.

16:53.311 --> 16:55.678
- Son, you gotta understand.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.279
I can't have you work here

16:57.281 --> 17:00.349
in your present
filthy "condisherin'."

17:00.717 --> 17:03.319
Oh!
That's the last straw!

17:03.321 --> 17:05.354
Mr. Squid--
- On it, sir.

17:05.356 --> 17:08.824
<i>Hasta la vista,</i>
worm boy.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.561
- And don't come back
until you're dewormed!

17:15.366 --> 17:17.500
- What am I gonna do?

17:18.469 --> 17:19.602
- Hey, SpongeBo--
Whoa!

17:19.604 --> 17:21.737
I see you've got yourself

17:21.739 --> 17:23.472
a little problem
with the cooties.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.474
- Yeah, and I lost
my job over it.

17:26.477 --> 17:28.411
- Lost your job you say?

17:28.413 --> 17:30.479
I might be able
to help you,

17:30.481 --> 17:33.182
if you can do
something for me.

17:33.184 --> 17:36.585
- Anything, Plankton!
Anything!

17:36.820 --> 17:40.256
Ridding SpongeBob of his worms

17:40.258 --> 17:42.658
will put him
forever in my debt.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.494
That secret formula
is good as mine.

17:47.498 --> 17:49.865
Time to crash
this lousy party.

17:49.867 --> 17:54.203
Get it? Lousy? Louse?
Oh, I'm good.

18:02.513 --> 18:07.450
Whoa!

18:08.219 --> 18:11.754
You're on your own, worm boy.

18:20.865 --> 18:26.268
Ah!

18:26.270 --> 18:26.969
- Hello?

18:26.971 --> 18:28.437
- You gotta help me!

18:28.439 --> 18:31.707
- Ah! It's a monster
with SpongeBob's voice!

18:31.709 --> 18:33.976
- No, no, Patrick, wait,
don't close the--

18:33.978 --> 18:34.944
Aw!

18:34.946 --> 18:36.312
- Hmm?

18:36.314 --> 18:39.348
Squidward. Squidward!

18:39.350 --> 18:40.583
Squidward.

18:41.586 --> 18:42.952
- I need a hug.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.529
Does that mean no hug?

18:53.531 --> 18:54.430
- There will be no hugs!

18:54.432 --> 18:57.466
Get away from me,
you monstrosity!

19:28.633 --> 19:31.800
Well, this my life
from now on, huh?

19:32.403 --> 19:33.669
Just call me
SpongeBob WormPants,

19:33.671 --> 19:37.940
'cause that's all I am,
just an apartment for worms.

19:55.359 --> 19:56.225
Oh, that's better.

19:56.227 --> 19:59.495
Looks like I really wormed
my way out of that one.

20:01.866 --> 20:03.566
Meow!

20:03.568 --> 20:06.769
- Gary, it feels so good
to be worm free.

20:14.445 --> 20:18.714
SpongeBob!
I need a hug!

20:39.803 --> 20:41.570
Hmm?

20:52.049 --> 20:54.750
Whew! Ahh.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.993
Hmm.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.748
Hmm.

22:42.759 --> 22:43.726
Ooh!
