00:13.995 --> 00:17.032
There's no chance that this bomb
is ever gonna go off

00:17.124 --> 00:19.745
with a Special Ops team
following it every step of the way.

00:19.835 --> 00:22.290
Jack Bauer found
the Coral Snake commandos.

00:22.379 --> 00:24.502
All six members of the team had been killed.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.507
If there's something
that you haven't told me...

00:27.592 --> 00:30.546
Ask Sherry.
She's the one you wanna talk to.

00:31.054 --> 00:32.383
My father works for the government.

00:32.472 --> 00:35.722
He said someone's gonna detonate
a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.

00:35.809 --> 00:37.517
- I'm gonna show you something.
- What is it?

00:37.602 --> 00:38.682
It's a bomb shelter.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.810
- It happened.
- The bomb went off?

00:40.897 --> 00:44.349
The radiation. We gotta get
down below, before it's too late.

00:47.070 --> 00:49.526
- Hello?
- There has been a change of plans.

00:49.614 --> 00:50.859
Why? What's going on?

00:50.949 --> 00:54.863
Marie, our mission depends on you now.
I'm counting on you.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.242
They're a rogue unit,
acting on their own authority.

01:03.336 --> 01:05.910
- How do I find them?
- Somewhere at the airport.

01:06.006 --> 01:08.793
Our best bet is still you
getting past them to the bomb.

01:08.884 --> 01:11.553
There is a nuclear warhead
somewhere on-site.

01:11.636 --> 01:12.965
There it is! Go, go!

01:13.054 --> 01:16.340
Put your hands above your head!
Keep 'em there!

01:16.433 --> 01:18.472
This isn't a bomb.
It's been rigged to look like one.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.387
This is not the bomb. This is a decoy.

01:20.479 --> 01:23.563
I repeat: we are still looking
for the nuclear device.

01:34.951 --> 01:37.573
OK, let's go easy with this.

01:39.247 --> 01:40.623
Go.

01:57.641 --> 02:01.804
You have to process the prints here.
Bring in your mobile equipment.

02:01.895 --> 02:05.346
You! Where's the real bomb?
Where's the real bomb?

02:06.483 --> 02:10.315
Do you understand me?
Do you speak any English?

02:10.402 --> 02:13.155
Do you speak any English?

02:13.240 --> 02:15.944
- Search him. I'll get us a translator.
- Yes, sir.

02:16.034 --> 02:19.284
This is Jack Bauer requesting
a translator in hangar 21.

02:19.371 --> 02:22.288
I repeat: I am requesting
a translator in hangar 21.

02:48.692 --> 02:52.061
Mr Mason, Jack Bauer is on line two.

02:52.154 --> 02:53.399
Good.

02:53.488 --> 02:57.735
- George.
- How's the search going over there, Jack?

02:57.826 --> 02:59.949
Still no new leads on where the bomb is.

03:00.996 --> 03:03.119
What about that plane
you found the decoy in?

03:03.206 --> 03:07.785
It's clean. Use reverse-time satellite to
trace the plane to its original location.

03:07.878 --> 03:12.006
That's where they would've loaded
the decoy. Find out who the players are.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.047
Here and here.

03:14.551 --> 03:17.338
George? You with me?

03:19.097 --> 03:22.015
George, can you hear me?
Are you all right?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.215
- Yeah.
- George!

03:23.310 --> 03:27.010
Yeah, I'm on it!
Reverse-time satellite. Yeah.

03:27.689 --> 03:31.769
I'm really sorry about everything
that's happened to you today.

03:31.860 --> 03:36.818
But if you can't think clearly, you need
to let someone else take over command.

03:36.907 --> 03:40.240
- There isn't anybody else, Jack.
- What about Tony?

03:42.412 --> 03:45.698
I got it together. I can
handle it. All right?

03:47.626 --> 03:48.657
Yeah, OK.

03:48.752 --> 03:51.753
- We do have another problem.
- What?

03:51.838 --> 03:56.833
The six dead commandos you found,
turns out a seventh may have escaped.

03:56.927 --> 03:59.252
I examined all the gunshot wounds.

03:59.346 --> 04:03.924
Three of the commandos knew the shooter -
their wounds were at close range.

04:04.017 --> 04:08.097
The others showed signs of a struggle,
which indicates they had time to react.

04:08.188 --> 04:12.482
- So the seventh didn't escape.
- Right. He was a shooter.

04:13.527 --> 04:17.394
I gotta go. Get me an ID on the seventh
commando as soon as you can.

04:17.488 --> 04:19.232
- I'm working on it.
- Good.

04:19.324 --> 04:23.156
- What do you got?
- A wallet, no ID, no credit cards.

04:29.167 --> 04:32.002
He wants to talk.
Where the hell is my translator?

04:37.884 --> 04:40.173
Mr Warner, it's your daughter Kate.

04:40.262 --> 04:41.637
- Kate?
- Dad?

04:41.721 --> 04:45.850
- Kate, where are you?
- I'm fine. I'm at an airport.

04:45.934 --> 04:48.721
The airport? Are you leaving the city?

04:48.812 --> 04:52.477
Not yet. I'm helping one of
the agents on an investigation.

04:53.358 --> 04:56.525
Dad... did they tell you about Reza?

04:56.611 --> 05:01.024
Yeah, I... I can't believe
what they're saying about Marie,

05:01.116 --> 05:05.529
that she's with these terrorists,
that she killed Reza. I...

05:05.620 --> 05:06.901
I know, Dad.

05:06.997 --> 05:09.073
- Kate...
- Dad, hold on a second.

05:09.166 --> 05:12.451
It wasn't the bomb. We arrested the pilot.
I need you as a translator.

05:12.544 --> 05:14.702
Dad, I'm gonna have to call you back.

05:14.796 --> 05:16.125
Are you OK?

05:16.214 --> 05:20.082
Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, I love you.

05:21.136 --> 05:23.709
I love you, too, sweetheart.

05:24.639 --> 05:29.800
- What exactly did Roger Stanton tell you?
- Sherry was somehow involved in this.

05:31.188 --> 05:34.391
- The nuclear threat?
- He didn't elaborate.

05:34.483 --> 05:36.559
That's all he said.

05:42.866 --> 05:46.911
They said it was urgent.
Is it about the bomb? Have they found it?

05:46.995 --> 05:49.320
Not yet. Sit down.

05:51.291 --> 05:55.834
I just spoke with Stanton. He confesses
that he's known about the bomb for weeks.

05:55.921 --> 05:59.788
For weeks? Why would he
withhold that from you?

05:59.883 --> 06:03.548
He wanted to wait until the bomb was
on US soil before he intercepted it.

06:03.637 --> 06:08.595
- So he knows where the bomb is.
- The men he had tracking it did.

06:08.683 --> 06:14.104
But they're all dead. The bomb's still
out there, and we don't know where it is.

06:14.189 --> 06:18.352
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

06:21.988 --> 06:24.658
Am I telling you something
you already know?

06:25.742 --> 06:28.364
- What?
- Tell me now.

06:29.871 --> 06:34.533
Have you done the unthinkable and put
yourself in league with Roger Stanton?

06:34.626 --> 06:38.042
That's outrageous! Of course not!
What did he say?

06:38.130 --> 06:39.328
Sit down.

06:39.422 --> 06:41.249
- David...
- Sit down!

06:43.635 --> 06:46.470
He said you were involved,
working against me.

06:46.555 --> 06:51.181
He's lying, David! I never even met
Roger Stanton until this afternoon!

06:51.268 --> 06:53.426
- That's not true.
- He's playing you!

06:53.520 --> 06:56.272
Whatever he's doing,
he wants you to believe I...

06:56.356 --> 06:58.432
Just stop it!

07:02.821 --> 07:08.824
Sherry... right now we are
teetering on the brink of a war

07:08.910 --> 07:11.995
that will lead to the deaths
of millions of people.

07:12.080 --> 07:18.000
We have to stop this disaster today,
right now, before it begins.

07:18.545 --> 07:23.705
If there is something you're not telling me,
anything that could help us find this bomb,

07:23.800 --> 07:26.801
as President of the United States,
I order you...

07:26.887 --> 07:31.181
No, as someone that you claim you love...

07:34.394 --> 07:39.103
I'm asking: help me, Sherry.

07:46.948 --> 07:52.322
I got a phone call... a few months ago
in the middle of the night

07:52.412 --> 07:57.573
from a friend of mine who's high up in NSA.

07:58.752 --> 08:03.663
He told me that Roger Stanton wanted
to speak to me first thing in the morning,

08:03.757 --> 08:09.842
and so we met at a park in Virginia.

08:12.432 --> 08:14.508
What did he want?

08:14.601 --> 08:18.017
- He wanted to recruit me.
- To do what?

08:20.941 --> 08:26.279
He wanted to know who was loyal
to you and who could be turned.

08:26.363 --> 08:31.653
He wanted... He wanted to
know where you were weak.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.738
And you told him?

08:39.417 --> 08:41.743
Yes.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.839
But I only did it to gain his confidence.

08:48.927 --> 08:55.179
I was not aligning myself with him.
I was doing it for you.

08:56.977 --> 09:02.315
David, I know you don't believe me,
but just give me 30 minutes

09:02.399 --> 09:05.483
to prove to you that I'm telling the truth,

09:05.569 --> 09:09.269
that I did all of this to protect you,

09:10.991 --> 09:12.734
not to hurt you.

09:18.415 --> 09:21.184
I think he's saying he
did it for his family.

09:21.284 --> 09:22.958
They promised him money.

09:23.044 --> 09:25.120
Ask him who "they" is.

09:35.223 --> 09:37.797
Syed Ali.

09:41.772 --> 09:44.726
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.311
Eh?

09:51.406 --> 09:55.238
I don't think that was right.
I think we have different dialects.

09:55.327 --> 09:57.734
It doesn't matter. Just keep trying.

10:05.253 --> 10:08.207
Jack, the translator's here.

10:08.298 --> 10:09.792
Jack Bauer.

10:09.883 --> 10:12.208
The subject's there. Kate?

10:15.847 --> 10:19.299
- I'm really sorry, Jack.
- You did great. You did great.

10:19.392 --> 10:23.770
Agent Baker will take you back to
the controlled area. I'll be there soon.

10:27.692 --> 10:30.943
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.

10:34.741 --> 10:37.410
He said he doesn't know anything.

10:46.461 --> 10:49.379
ID, please. Can I see your ID?

11:00.016 --> 11:01.926
Who are those people over there?

11:02.018 --> 11:06.431
They're locking down the airport, checking
everyone. Excuse me for one second.

11:32.799 --> 11:36.002
Ask him where he went to school
and the name of his sponsor.

11:41.767 --> 11:46.310
I can't believe the bomb went off.
What did you hear? How many people?

11:46.396 --> 11:50.892
I don't know.
The transmission just went dead.

11:51.735 --> 11:54.356
Are you gonna be OK?

11:54.446 --> 11:56.818
My dad, I need to get in touch with my dad.

11:56.907 --> 12:02.447
We will. But for right now, we have
to stay down here, where it's safe.

12:02.537 --> 12:06.665
We have no idea which way
that radiation cloud is gonna travel.

12:08.710 --> 12:12.578
I'll see if I can pick something up
on the short-wave radio, OK?

12:32.818 --> 12:37.278
...LA's favourite all-talk radio
all the time, 24-7.

12:37.364 --> 12:41.492
The school voucher debate is really
beginning to heat up again here...

12:46.832 --> 12:48.492
What did they say?

12:48.583 --> 12:52.202
The radiation is interfering
with the antenna.

12:52.295 --> 12:56.957
It could be hours before
we're able to pick up anything.

12:59.886 --> 13:02.638
What's gonna happen to us?

13:13.400 --> 13:17.480
- Shh, it's OK.
- I'm scared.

13:17.571 --> 13:20.525
Don't be scared.
You got nothing to be scared of.

13:20.615 --> 13:24.115
We're safe down here. I promise.

13:38.216 --> 13:40.921
You must be the new assistant Division sent.

13:41.011 --> 13:43.502
Carrie Turner. You must be George Mason.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.055
Excuse me...

13:49.770 --> 13:51.846
You look worse than I expected.

13:52.856 --> 13:56.023
- Is there something I can help you with?
- No, I'm set.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.814
I've been following everything
from Division.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.695
I'll be taking over from Paula,

14:00.781 --> 14:04.825
so if there's anything you need
the server to do, I'll make it happen.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.279
Good. The situation reports
have changed in the past hour,

14:08.371 --> 14:11.538
so you have to refresh
all the computer monitors.

14:11.625 --> 14:15.325
No problem. Just make sure everyone
keeps their hands off my system.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.792
OK.

14:17.881 --> 14:23.836
Mr Mason... who do I report to... directly?

14:24.763 --> 14:27.254
You report to me.

14:27.349 --> 14:32.805
No offense, Mr Mason, but rumour has it
you're not gonna be around much longer.

14:33.438 --> 14:36.890
So... who do I report to?

14:38.485 --> 14:40.324
I finally get someone
around here who I like,

14:40.362 --> 14:43.277
and I'm not gonna be around to enjoy it.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.192
Tony Almeida.

14:47.285 --> 14:49.492
And Michelle D-Dessler.

14:50.413 --> 14:53.498
- Did you say Michelle Dessler?
- Yes, I did. Why?

14:53.583 --> 14:58.660
We worked together at District.
I was her boss then.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.959
And you're telling me this why?

15:03.051 --> 15:06.502
It'll be fine. It's not important.

15:09.099 --> 15:11.506
Mr Mason?

15:11.601 --> 15:15.136
My God. Mr Mason? Mr Mason!

15:15.230 --> 15:18.017
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

15:20.610 --> 15:24.145
- Picture ID?
- Thank you for your cooperation.

15:24.239 --> 15:28.403
We will try to get you out of here
as quickly as we can.

15:33.498 --> 15:37.626
Arms straight out.
Just stand perfectly still.

15:37.711 --> 15:42.788
Prepare to give the scanners any
metal objects in your pockets beforehand.

15:42.883 --> 15:46.086
It will speed the process through the line.

15:48.930 --> 15:52.180
- Marie!
- No need to be concerned.

15:52.267 --> 15:55.553
Please just cooperate. We appreciate it.

15:55.645 --> 15:58.397
- Whoa, excuse me. You can't go there.
- What?

15:58.482 --> 16:00.854
Everyone is searched before they're let go.

16:00.942 --> 16:03.777
- It's my sister. It's important.
- Sorry.

16:05.280 --> 16:08.614
Wait, here. I'm with Jack Bauer, CTU.

16:10.285 --> 16:12.657
- OK. Go on.
- Thanks.

16:12.746 --> 16:16.364
Could you get in touch with Jack Bauer?
Tell him Marie Warner is here.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.497
He'll understand.

16:18.585 --> 16:22.001
Dispatch, we need to locate
a Jack Bauer with CTU.

16:22.088 --> 16:24.046
Copy that.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.407
- Marie.
- I need your badge, Kate.

17:00.502 --> 17:02.459
Where've you been?

17:02.546 --> 17:04.289
- Give me your badge.
- Marie...

17:04.381 --> 17:07.050
Shut up. You stupid idiot.

17:07.134 --> 17:10.134
Why did you have to start snooping around?

17:10.220 --> 17:11.335
What's going on?

17:11.430 --> 17:15.723
You have always treated me like
I was some helpless injured animal.

17:15.809 --> 17:18.929
Like I couldn't get by
without you looking over me.

17:19.020 --> 17:21.143
What happened to you?

17:22.148 --> 17:24.935
I opened my eyes.
That's what happened to me.

17:25.026 --> 17:29.938
I was pathetic, just like you.
Until I met Syed.

17:30.031 --> 17:33.863
Until I saw the lies and hypocrisy
of my life, of this country,

17:33.952 --> 17:37.950
of people like Dad, who help the
government. He works for the CIA.

17:38.039 --> 17:39.238
I know. So what?

17:39.332 --> 17:43.496
So what? Do you have any idea the
suffering they cause around the world?

17:43.587 --> 17:47.086
Oh, please. What are you, six years old?

17:47.174 --> 17:51.919
You think Dad is the enemy now?
I can't believe how ungrateful you are.

17:52.929 --> 17:54.210
I should be grateful?

17:54.306 --> 18:00.059
Yeah, absolutely. Dad and I turned our lives
upside down for you after Mom died.

18:00.145 --> 18:05.851
This is what we did it for? So you could
be brainwashed by some lunatic?

18:05.942 --> 18:10.604
Wake up! You're about to become
the biggest murderer in American history!

18:20.916 --> 18:24.830
- What are you gonna do?
- Give me your badge.

18:25.378 --> 18:26.623
No.

18:27.631 --> 18:29.291
Fine.

18:31.343 --> 18:35.839
Marie, listen to me.
There's a nuclear bomb in the city.

18:37.140 --> 18:42.217
No matter what you believe, you don't
want all those innocent people to die.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.269
Give me the badge.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.524
No. I don't believe you'd shoot me.

18:49.611 --> 18:54.606
I will... because this is
more important than your life.

18:56.326 --> 18:58.568
Or my life.

19:05.502 --> 19:07.578
Kate, stay down!

19:08.755 --> 19:10.831
- Stay down!
- My arm!

19:10.924 --> 19:12.122
Secure the weapon!

19:12.217 --> 19:14.174
- You all right?
- Yeah.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.132
I take it that's your sister.

19:47.043 --> 19:49.499
At least give her something for the pain.

19:49.588 --> 19:53.253
- I will when she tells us what she knows.
- You can't let her suffer.

19:53.341 --> 19:57.042
You're gonna have to let me do this
my way. You have to trust me.

19:57.137 --> 19:58.964
I know you love her.

19:59.055 --> 20:02.590
But I have to worry about
the millions of lives at stake.

20:02.684 --> 20:05.768
She is the only person
who knows where this bomb is.

20:05.854 --> 20:09.437
I need to use every advantage I've got
to find it and stop it.

20:09.524 --> 20:12.062
Surely you understand that.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.233
Just let me do this.

20:25.749 --> 20:27.825
Give me your arm.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.268
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.144
You can go to hell, you bastard.
I'm not telling you anything.

21:08.708 --> 21:11.793
You wanna know why the pain's so severe?

21:11.878 --> 21:15.247
The bullet's still in your arm,
lodged against the bone.

21:19.261 --> 21:23.887
Tell me where the bomb is, and I'll get you
something for the pain and treat your arm.

21:26.268 --> 21:31.606
Please, Marie, just talk to me.
Just talk to me. Tell me where the bomb is.

21:31.690 --> 21:32.935
No!

21:45.579 --> 21:49.113
I know you think what you're doing now
will further your cause.

21:49.207 --> 21:52.327
Deep down, I don't think
you wanna go through with it.

21:52.419 --> 21:56.251
I don't think you can justify killing
millions of innocent civilians.

21:56.339 --> 21:59.459
Nobody's innocent in this country.

22:01.678 --> 22:03.754
I'm not afraid to die.

22:13.607 --> 22:17.735
I don't believe you. I've seen
people who are willing to die.

22:17.819 --> 22:22.647
I've looked them straight in the eye,
just like right now.

22:23.158 --> 22:25.234
You're not one of them.

22:26.328 --> 22:29.661
I wanna give you a painkiller,
but you must help me first.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.120
Please tell me where the bomb is.

22:32.209 --> 22:34.035
Where's the bomb?

22:54.022 --> 22:56.098
I'm gonna check the radio.

23:00.862 --> 23:02.570
Do you have any sugar?

23:02.656 --> 23:06.819
Yeah, yeah, it's in the back corner,
on the shelf there.

23:17.254 --> 23:21.038
Is the TV hooked up to the same antenna?

23:26.555 --> 23:29.128
Everyone can take out their golf clubs...

23:29.224 --> 23:32.011
...delivery is... Swung on.

23:32.102 --> 23:35.138
...prominent civic leaders
and Hollywood stars...

23:35.230 --> 23:38.765
...record numbers today gathered at beaches

23:38.859 --> 23:41.978
to celebrate the beautiful
weather of California,

23:42.070 --> 23:45.653
which will continue throughout the weekend.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.246
Still nothing.

24:03.091 --> 24:05.333
- This is our man?
- Yeah.

24:05.427 --> 24:07.254
Seventh commando.

24:07.345 --> 24:11.260
Captain Jonathan Wallace.
Led a sniper unit in the Gulf War,

24:11.349 --> 24:13.638
led an assassination detail in Malaysia.

24:13.727 --> 24:15.803
- Have you got this to Jack?
- I'm on it.

24:15.896 --> 24:19.015
Start up a shared volume
with OC on this guy.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.524
Hello, Michelle.

24:30.243 --> 24:35.534
- Carrie, what are you doing here?
- Division sent me over to replace Paula.

24:35.624 --> 24:39.953
Right. Do you need help getting into any
of the locked volumes on the network?

24:40.045 --> 24:44.790
No, actually. I'm all up and running.
You look great, by the way.

24:44.883 --> 24:47.291
- Stop it, Carrie.
- Stop what?

24:49.221 --> 24:51.759
You're not my boss today, all right?

24:51.848 --> 24:55.928
If you're here to replace Paula,
then technically you work for me.

24:56.019 --> 24:59.470
Fine. Give me an order.

25:03.860 --> 25:08.736
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
We've been charged with finding it.

25:08.824 --> 25:12.275
So why don't you start by analyzing these?

25:17.541 --> 25:19.118
Fine.

25:31.138 --> 25:35.135
- Tony, do you have a second?
- Sure.

25:36.393 --> 25:38.469
What is it?

25:39.855 --> 25:43.603
I think it's time I step down.
I'm not feeling so hot here.

25:44.818 --> 25:48.685
- Is there anything I can do?
- Actually, yeah.

25:48.780 --> 25:53.027
Tomorrow, when this is all over,
say goodbye to everybody for me

25:53.118 --> 25:56.451
and let them know what an honour
it was working with them

25:56.538 --> 26:00.618
and what a great job I think
they all did, everybody.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.455
Sure.

26:04.463 --> 26:08.959
This morning when I told you
I couldn't wait to get out of here...

26:09.050 --> 26:11.209
I don't feel that way any more.

26:13.221 --> 26:16.092
- Here you go.
- What's this?

26:16.516 --> 26:19.719
Access codes for the CTU and Division.

26:20.604 --> 26:25.894
I can't take this, George. Only the CTU
director is allowed that kind of access.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.985
You're the new CTU director, Tony.

26:29.070 --> 26:32.985
You can't promote me, George.
Only Chappelle can do that.

26:33.074 --> 26:36.609
I just talked to Chappelle.
You're the new guy.

26:39.831 --> 26:44.209
Listen, George... I'm sorry, I...

26:44.294 --> 26:47.046
Hey, don't.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.918
Good luck.

27:27.796 --> 27:29.753
I'll be operating from up here,

27:29.840 --> 27:32.959
so I'll need my access codes
piped into the system.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.210
Got it. Everyone's ready.

27:35.303 --> 27:37.379
Good. Thanks.

27:53.029 --> 27:55.437
In case you haven't heard,

27:55.532 --> 28:00.241
George Mason was exposed to a lethal
dose of plutonium this morning.

28:00.328 --> 28:02.487
I'm afraid he hasn't got much time.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.787
He just left the office and won't come back,

28:05.876 --> 28:10.336
which means that I'll be in charge
until further notice.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.122
Now, on a normal day,
we'd be mourning George,

28:14.217 --> 28:18.001
just like we would've
mourned Ivers and Clark

28:18.096 --> 28:22.308
and Paula and the rest of our co-workers
who were killed here today.

28:22.392 --> 28:25.726
Unfortunately, we have to
hold our thoughts of them

28:25.812 --> 28:29.644
until we can get through
this present crisis.

28:29.733 --> 28:33.980
So... let's get back to work.

28:36.656 --> 28:39.527
Tony.

28:39.618 --> 28:45.039
- It was a nice thing you just did.
- What's going on at the airfield?

28:45.123 --> 28:49.335
Jack's still interrogating Marie Warner.
We don't have anything new.

28:49.419 --> 28:51.993
- All right. Keep me posted.
- Sure.

28:58.261 --> 29:01.096
Stay with me, Marie. Stay with me.

29:01.181 --> 29:04.301
Steve, walk with me.
Get her Demerol for the pain.

29:04.392 --> 29:06.681
She's going into shock. I need her lucid.

29:06.770 --> 29:09.640
- For how long?
- Five minutes should do it.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.225
- Kate.
- Yeah.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.191
- What did she say?
- She hasn't said anything yet.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.400
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Help? How?

29:20.492 --> 29:23.825
You're her sister.
I need you to bring her back to reality.

29:23.912 --> 29:26.617
You know her like that. I don't.

29:26.706 --> 29:31.783
I thought I did. She's a different person
from the Marie I knew this morning.

29:31.878 --> 29:34.630
No, Kate. She's the same girl
you grew up with.

29:34.714 --> 29:38.083
She's just regurgitating everything
Syed Ali taught her.

29:38.176 --> 29:42.221
I need you to remind her of
the things she used to love.

29:42.305 --> 29:45.639
You can do this, Kate. You can get to her.

29:50.730 --> 29:51.975
All right.

29:55.485 --> 29:59.317
She's going to be a little groggy
because of the painkiller, OK?

30:06.955 --> 30:09.031
You all right?

30:09.749 --> 30:11.541
Yeah.

30:21.303 --> 30:24.007
Hey, Marie.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.013
Hi, Kate.

30:30.479 --> 30:33.052
Get away. I don't need you.

30:34.775 --> 30:39.068
- Why won't you help us?
- I am gonna help you.

30:40.655 --> 30:43.941
I'm gonna help you stop
being a part of the problem.

30:48.789 --> 30:53.285
So it's OK with you if Dad and I died today?

30:56.463 --> 31:00.959
I killed Reza. And I loved him.

31:01.051 --> 31:03.968
Why would I care about you and Dad?

31:06.098 --> 31:10.427
Because we care for you.
Because we love you.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.896
Why are you doing this?

31:18.985 --> 31:22.651
Marie, you could save everyone.

31:22.739 --> 31:26.191
You could stop this terrible thing
from happening.

31:27.369 --> 31:32.244
I don't want to. I can't.

31:32.332 --> 31:36.164
Marie, I'm begging you. Please.

31:37.546 --> 31:39.622
No.

31:50.475 --> 31:53.975
My arm... God!

31:55.730 --> 31:58.019
Kate, I need you to step back.

32:01.903 --> 32:06.530
That's the Demerol wearing off. Tell me
where the bomb is, and I'll get you more.

32:07.451 --> 32:09.609
Please tell me where the bomb is.

32:09.703 --> 32:11.992
Marie, just tell him, please.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.034
- Where is the bomb?
- Give her something for the pain.

32:15.125 --> 32:17.794
No, no.

32:17.878 --> 32:22.586
Marie, please. Tell me where the bomb is.
Where is the bomb?

32:22.674 --> 32:25.924
- Katie, make him stop!
- No, Marie.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.383
You make him stop.

32:31.641 --> 32:34.808
The pain will get worse.
Just tell me where the bomb is.

32:36.521 --> 32:40.353
It's all right.
Just tell me where the bomb is.

32:45.322 --> 32:47.528
In the suitcase.

32:47.616 --> 32:50.367
Where's the suitcase?

32:52.245 --> 32:55.697
- In the van.
- What van?

32:55.791 --> 32:58.163
Where was the van headed?

32:59.211 --> 33:01.499
- Downtown.
- Where downtown?

33:01.588 --> 33:03.711
At the Arco Towers.

33:03.799 --> 33:06.965
What kind of van was it?
What colour? What make?

33:07.844 --> 33:10.762
Uh... green. I don't know what make.

33:10.847 --> 33:14.181
We're looking for a green van.
The nuke may be inside.

33:14.267 --> 33:17.601
- Send a team down to the Arco.
- When is the bomb set to go off?

33:18.897 --> 33:21.566
- Three hours.
- How do you know that?

33:21.650 --> 33:24.401
- I saw the timer.
- Describe it.

33:25.153 --> 33:28.356
- What?
- The timer. Describe it.

33:28.448 --> 33:30.820
I don't...

33:31.868 --> 33:36.080
You're lying to me. A bomb that size
wouldn't have a visual timer.

33:37.541 --> 33:43.246
I'm not lying. It's at the Arco Towers.
Send them all downtown now.

33:43.338 --> 33:48.166
Why now? What's the hurry? I thought I had
three hours. You told me I had three hours.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.336
No, I'm not lying!

34:02.107 --> 34:05.725
Why do you want me and my team
to leave here so fast?

34:07.821 --> 34:10.312
The bomb's still here, isn't it, Marie?

34:12.199 --> 34:14.275
No.

34:15.203 --> 34:16.995
Yes, it is.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.829
Teams A and B, do a grid search
on every outbuilding at the airport,

34:20.917 --> 34:22.993
starting north, heading south.

34:23.085 --> 34:26.870
The bomb is on-site.
I repeat: the bomb is on-site.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.511
Oh, Marie.

34:35.139 --> 34:38.056
They're not gonna find it in time.

34:39.268 --> 34:42.056
We're all gonna die.

34:54.074 --> 34:57.242
I'll sleep on the floor.
You can have my bed.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.950
Mr President, your call's ready.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.163
Steve Hillenburg at Langley.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.785
Yes, a CIA operative.
He's on an isolated feed.

35:05.879 --> 35:10.422
Nobody else knows about this
but the three of you.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.506
- Sherry's waiting.
- Good. Thanks.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.560
- Hello, Steve.
- Mr President.

35:28.652 --> 35:31.688
What's your involvement in this?

35:31.780 --> 35:35.363
I got a call from Sherry
about four months ago.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.692
She told me Roger Stanton was trying

35:37.786 --> 35:41.653
to recruit her in an effort to
undermine your presidency.

35:41.748 --> 35:46.743
She wanted an independent source to
confirm that she was doing it to help you.

35:46.837 --> 35:49.707
So you've been building
a case against Stanton

35:49.798 --> 35:53.463
for the last four months
without my knowledge.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.221
Plausible deniability, sir.

35:56.304 --> 36:02.888
What we were doing was illegal,
but... we felt it was necessary.

36:04.146 --> 36:07.515
It could've backfired and landed
Sherry and me in prison.

36:07.607 --> 36:10.359
We didn't want this to touch you
if that happened.

36:10.444 --> 36:13.813
OK, let's say I accept that.

36:13.905 --> 36:17.357
What proof do you have
that exonerates Sherry?

36:17.451 --> 36:21.744
I have photographs, taped
conversations, debriefs,

36:21.830 --> 36:24.285
files filled with the work Sherry did.

36:24.374 --> 36:28.751
These meetings that Sherry and Roger had,
where'd they take place?

36:29.754 --> 36:31.831
Sherry?

36:33.300 --> 36:35.376
Um...

36:37.012 --> 36:42.137
For the first month, we met
at a hotel in Hilton Head.

36:44.728 --> 36:47.598
- I didn't sleep with him.
- I didn't ask.

36:47.689 --> 36:50.560
Thank you. I'll contact you
if I need anything else.

36:50.650 --> 36:51.813
Thank you, sir.

36:55.405 --> 36:59.355
You know, I don't care what
you think of me right now.

36:59.451 --> 37:04.576
The most important thing is that you
realise that I never, and I mean never,

37:04.664 --> 37:06.906
was a part of Stanton's conspiracy.

37:09.169 --> 37:11.707
You know what, Sherry?

37:11.797 --> 37:15.415
You might be telling me the truth.
Then again, you might not.

37:15.509 --> 37:21.381
Right now, I don't have the time or energy
to figure out whether I can trust you.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.011
You have to trust me, David.

37:24.101 --> 37:29.937
Your presidency is in jeopardy and
so is this country. Let me help you.

37:31.233 --> 37:33.937
No. You'll leave now.

37:38.156 --> 37:42.652
David... you need me.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.469
If you resist in any way,

37:50.969 --> 37:53.330
I'll have no choice but to
place you under arrest.

37:58.218 --> 38:01.966
- Yes, sir?
- Please escort Mrs Palmer to her car.

38:13.108 --> 38:17.485
We got a ventilation system in here
and an air supply, but it still stays cold.

38:17.571 --> 38:21.070
But don't worry because
we got tons of blankets.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.108
- You tired?
- I'm OK.

38:27.914 --> 38:31.497
You're still worried about
your family, aren't you?

38:32.461 --> 38:35.296
Try not to think about them too much.

38:35.964 --> 38:38.206
You're probably right.

38:42.512 --> 38:45.549
- So, did you grow up in LA?
- Yeah.

38:45.640 --> 38:49.721
- Oh, yeah? Me too. What part?
- We moved around a lot.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.314
My foot is still hurting.
Do you have any aspirin?

38:54.399 --> 38:56.522
Yeah, yeah, sure. I got tons.

39:01.573 --> 39:06.733
You're gonna let me out of here right now.
I know the bomb didn't go off.

39:08.163 --> 39:09.705
- Kim...
- Stay away!

39:09.790 --> 39:12.956
OK, it's OK. Just calm down.

39:17.047 --> 39:19.716
- I wasn't gonna hurt you.
- Then let me go!

39:19.800 --> 39:24.296
- I just wanted some company, that's all.
- Then what are you doing out here?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.840
This is where I belong.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.009
I don't.

39:33.105 --> 39:38.146
- I want you to stay.
- I don't wanna stay.

39:40.153 --> 39:42.229
Why not?

39:43.782 --> 39:46.617
What's wrong with me?
I'm not good enough?

39:47.327 --> 39:50.198
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Then why?

39:54.334 --> 39:55.876
You think I'm psycho?

39:55.961 --> 39:59.294
I don't know if you're psycho.
I don't even know you.

39:59.381 --> 40:03.544
Wouldn't you rather be with
someone who wants to be here?

40:06.096 --> 40:08.172
You don't even wanna get to know me?

40:10.142 --> 40:12.467
Please let me out of here, Lonnie.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.689
Please.

40:49.473 --> 40:51.549
- Here.
- What?

40:51.641 --> 40:53.717
Take it.

40:55.020 --> 41:00.310
There's cougars out there. If you see one,
fire a shot in the air and they'll take off.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.497
Turn right out the front door.

41:18.585 --> 41:21.447
About 200 yards away,
you'll see a deer trail.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.745
That'll lead you to the highway.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.916
Thank you.

41:29.596 --> 41:31.256
Kim?

41:33.308 --> 41:35.799
Maybe you'll come back sometime?

41:35.894 --> 41:37.554
I don't think so.

42:02.879 --> 42:05.287
Goodrich, what's going on?

42:06.007 --> 42:08.759
All agents, one hostile down!

42:12.472 --> 42:14.216
Go, go, go!

42:14.891 --> 42:16.801
Over here!

42:22.190 --> 42:24.349
Let's go! Bring 'em in!

42:43.253 --> 42:45.791
- What do we got?
- It's nuclear.

42:49.718 --> 42:52.387
And there's the trigger. This is it.

42:52.471 --> 42:57.713
This is Jack Bauer. We found the bomb.
Initiate a level-one local evac now.

43:10.697 --> 43:13.900
- It's armed.
- How much time have we got?

43:13.992 --> 43:16.565
I can't tell. Could be any second.
