WEBVTT

00:08.068 --> 00:11.068
[Narrator] 48 days ago,
the race of a lifetime began.

00:12.517 --> 00:15.620
[Dramatic music playing]

00:15.655 --> 00:17.896
What have we got ourselves into?

00:17.931 --> 00:20.103
[Narrator] Five
pairs of ordinary brits

00:20.137 --> 00:24.103
embarked on a 25,000
kilometer journey.

00:24.137 --> 00:26.896
- Let's go!
- [Narrator] From Mexico City

00:28.000 --> 00:30.241
to ushuaia, Argentina...

00:31.344 --> 00:34.448
The most southerly
city in the world.

00:34.482 --> 00:38.206
- They battled extreme weather.
- Oh, my god!

00:38.241 --> 00:42.206
- Trekked high into the andes.
- If I can do this, I can do a hell of a lot more.

00:42.241 --> 00:44.310
[Narrator] Crossed vast desert.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.137
I can't see anything for miles.

00:46.172 --> 00:49.379
[Narrator] And navigated some
of the world's most volatile regions.

00:49.413 --> 00:50.931
Cut the video, he has a gun.

00:50.965 --> 00:53.482
"Need to evacuate asap
before the border closes."

00:53.517 --> 00:55.896
- [Man] Oh, my god.
- Come on, what's next?

00:55.931 --> 00:59.310
[Narrator] All with budgets
stretched to breaking point.

00:59.344 --> 01:01.793
We do need to move fast,
but we need to move cheap.

01:01.827 --> 01:04.586
- How much money we got?
- It's gone.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.862
- Our race is over.
- You're joking.

01:06.896 --> 01:08.448
[Narrator] The rewards
have been great.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.965
That is the best view that
I've ever seen in my life.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.413
This is quite something.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.103
I'll be absolutely gutted
if I knew I'd missed it.

01:15.137 --> 01:19.206
- The way they look at life is just heaven to me.
- [Calling in native language]

01:19.241 --> 01:22.137
- Yes! Come on!
- [Laughing]

01:24.379 --> 01:26.413
I think we should light
a candle for grandma.

01:26.448 --> 01:29.793
I want to give what I can to them
kids... Shouldn't be like this, man.

01:29.827 --> 01:32.172
[Narrator] Now, with
the finish line in sight,

01:33.034 --> 01:36.413
£20,000 awaits the winners

01:36.448 --> 01:39.034
ofrace across the world.

01:40.379 --> 01:41.724
Go, go, go!

01:41.758 --> 01:45.448
- Vamos! Vamos!
- Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:47.172 --> 01:48.413
Oh, my god.

01:51.448 --> 01:53.103
[Narrator] Previously...

01:53.137 --> 01:54.724
Why are we never first?

01:54.758 --> 01:56.620
We'll have our chance
at the end, hopefully.

01:56.655 --> 01:58.793
[Narrator] The teams
headed back to Argentina...

01:58.827 --> 02:00.275
Mendoza, here we come.

02:00.310 --> 02:02.000
[Narrator] ...With
budgets critically low.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.344
What we've got left wouldn't
even get us to mendoza.

02:05.379 --> 02:06.758
Buenos Aires at 9:30?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.724
[Narrator] Getting
hung up in Uruguay...

02:08.758 --> 02:10.241
I don't think we'll make it.

02:10.275 --> 02:12.655
[Narrator] Meant more
shifts for emon and jamiul.

02:12.689 --> 02:15.344
- The onus is on us to earn some money.
- Gracias.

02:15.379 --> 02:17.620
We're looking to do some work.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.827
[Narrator] While Jen
and Rob's improvisation...

02:19.862 --> 02:21.424
- Pretty impressed with Jen today.
- [Exclaims]

02:21.448 --> 02:23.517
We worked well
together. It's a nice feeling.

02:23.551 --> 02:26.310
[Narrator] Saw them leapfrog
the boys into the race lead

02:26.344 --> 02:28.000
for the first time.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.551
We need to go for the win now.

02:29.586 --> 02:30.734
[Narrator] A confidence boost...

02:30.758 --> 02:32.517
Are you guys going to posadas?

02:32.551 --> 02:34.551
We've never actually
hitchhiked before.

02:34.586 --> 02:37.620
[Narrator] Helped dom
and Lizzie close in...

02:37.655 --> 02:39.172
Clearly doing something right.

02:39.206 --> 02:42.551
[Man] This is the weirdest
job I've ever had in my life.

02:42.586 --> 02:43.965
[Narrator] But
running on empty...

02:44.000 --> 02:47.517
It would be really upsetting
not to get to the end.

02:47.551 --> 02:50.448
[Narrator] Left Jo and
Sam teetering on the brink.

02:50.482 --> 02:53.379
The budget is very tight.

02:53.413 --> 02:56.344
Don't even know whether
we'll be able to finish.

02:57.896 --> 03:02.310
- [Birds chirping]
- [Serene music playing]

03:15.275 --> 03:17.965
I think we can have
a little cheeky look.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.689
See what the situation is.

03:19.724 --> 03:21.620
- Oh, dom and Lizzie.
- Smashed it.

03:21.655 --> 03:24.379
- Five hours after us.
- Sam and Jo not here?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.724
Not yet. They have
to make it today.

03:26.758 --> 03:29.655
[Narrator] Jo and Sam
may not be in the book...

03:29.689 --> 03:32.931
- Who do you think is ahead?
- Jamiul and emon, I reckon.

03:32.965 --> 03:35.241
[Narrator] But they
are in the hotel.

03:35.275 --> 03:38.586
-Hello, hello,
hello -hello, guys.

03:42.517 --> 03:45.000
Oh, she's crying.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.517
- So, what's going on?
- All good.

03:50.793 --> 03:53.344
Well, we've run out of money.

03:53.379 --> 03:54.965
No way.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.620
[Jo] We realized we
couldn't go on to the final leg.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.034
Oh.

03:59.068 --> 04:02.931
-So we were at this ranch... Was it in Argentina?
-[Laughs] Yes.

04:02.965 --> 04:04.355
All right, we're
still in Argentina.

04:04.379 --> 04:06.482
You see what I've
had to cope with.

04:06.517 --> 04:08.896
Those beautiful moments,
we're riding horses,

04:08.931 --> 04:10.793
what she wanted
to do the whole trip.

04:10.827 --> 04:14.655
And finishing it somewhere
beautiful on a horse,

04:14.689 --> 04:16.551
riding off into the sunset.

04:16.586 --> 04:18.068
That's what we did.

04:18.103 --> 04:22.793
[Jo] Last seven weeks have been
incredible. We've done so much.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.551
- Down by the creek with the horses.
- I know.

04:25.586 --> 04:27.137
You enjoying this,
mum, you happy?

04:27.172 --> 04:29.344
Yeah, loving it.
Absolutely loving it.

04:29.379 --> 04:30.620
[Jo] This is what's important.

04:30.655 --> 04:34.275
These wonderful
experiences with Sam.

04:34.310 --> 04:38.103
[Sam] It's been life changing,
seeing all different people and lives.

04:38.137 --> 04:40.103
It's just had a
massive effect on me.

04:40.137 --> 04:42.413
I've seen your communication

04:42.448 --> 04:44.344
get better and
better and better.

04:44.379 --> 04:49.137
You've grown a lot controlling
your adhd and things.

04:49.172 --> 04:52.896
You know you can do that
now, you've done brilliantly.

04:52.931 --> 04:55.344
- [Sam] Don't be sad.
- [Jo] I know.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.103
I'm happy, because
we had a great time.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.793
I feel really gutted for you.

05:01.827 --> 05:06.068
- We really wanted to finish the race with you guys.
- [Jo] I know. We did too.

05:06.103 --> 05:08.241
It's been so
wonderful meeting you.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.310
It's just 'cause we
were like a team.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.793
You want the best for everyone.

05:12.827 --> 05:15.827
You want everyone to
succeed, you will them to do well.

05:15.862 --> 05:17.896
You realize how
much you go through.

05:17.931 --> 05:20.931
People put in so much
blood, sweat, and tears.

05:20.965 --> 05:24.620
- Thank you. This is good.
- What are we gonna do without mama Jo?

05:24.655 --> 05:27.379
We've just found this bond
with them that I can't explain.

05:27.413 --> 05:29.182
When we finish in ushuaia
and they're not there,

05:29.206 --> 05:30.758
there's gonna be a massive void.

05:30.793 --> 05:33.068
I think if I'd brought my
other son, we'd be okay.

05:33.103 --> 05:34.896
[All laugh]

05:34.931 --> 05:39.000
-He is tight with money, so...
-Yeah, exactly. We'd have loads.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.551
It's really sad
not to finish it,

05:43.586 --> 05:46.103
but brilliant to
see you guys here.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.517
Devastating, isn't it,
really? It's heartbreaking.

05:48.551 --> 05:50.482
I thought they'd get to ushuaia.

05:51.275 --> 05:54.034
[Indistinct]

05:57.344 --> 05:58.827
- I don't know...
- Wait.

06:00.206 --> 06:04.862
[Serene music playing]

06:07.379 --> 06:12.310
[Narrator] Now just three teams
remain, separated by nine hours.

06:12.344 --> 06:15.551
Ahead, the longest
leg of the race.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.931
With budgets
running perilously low,

06:18.965 --> 06:23.206
the teams will have to use all their skills
and ingenuity to reach the finish line.

06:27.965 --> 06:30.413
It's a 1:30 A.M. start...

06:30.448 --> 06:31.896
Buenas noches.

06:31.931 --> 06:34.724
For brand new race
leaders Jen and Rob,

06:34.758 --> 06:41.000
with the healthiest budget, over
£130 more than their nearest rivals.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.586
"From here, you will need to
utilize all the skills and smarts

06:43.620 --> 06:44.907
you have learned
to make it to ushuaia.

06:44.931 --> 06:46.862
The team that
reaches the finish line

06:46.896 --> 06:50.241
in first place wins
a £20,000 prize."

06:50.275 --> 06:54.620
When we started out, it seemed like
weeks and weeks and weeks in the future,

06:54.655 --> 06:57.655
you never had to worry
about it. It's finally here.

06:57.689 --> 07:00.931
Boom. It's ushuaia time.

07:00.965 --> 07:04.655
[Narrator] With 21,000
kilometers already under their belts,

07:04.689 --> 07:08.137
the teams face 4,000 more.

07:08.172 --> 07:11.482
Racing a third of the entire
south American continent

07:11.517 --> 07:15.379
through Argentina to
the finish line in ushuaia.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.838
Do you think the bus
station is going to be open?

07:19.862 --> 07:22.931
- Yes, it is open.
- It is open. Okay.

07:22.965 --> 07:27.310
The pressure is on us leaders to stay ahead
of everyone else and not make mistakes.

07:27.344 --> 07:30.482
Patagonia is the most
expensive part of Argentina.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.275
That means that we
could run out of money.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.137
We could have a
Sam and Jo sitch.

07:36.172 --> 07:38.320
[Narrator] To get to ushuaia,
the teams must head through

07:38.344 --> 07:42.448
one of the most remote
areas in the world... patagonia.

07:42.482 --> 07:45.344
Inland, a sparsely
populated wilderness

07:45.379 --> 07:49.172
of lakes, fjords,
forests, and glaciers

07:49.206 --> 07:52.689
popular with tourists brave
enough to venture this far south

07:52.724 --> 07:55.724
that can become inaccessible
with extreme weather.

07:55.758 --> 07:58.137
My initial thoughts
are coastal...

07:58.172 --> 08:01.241
Penguins sound
nice. Fast, fast, fast.

08:01.275 --> 08:03.448
[Narrator] Hugging the
coastline may offer the chance

08:03.482 --> 08:05.172
to hop from town to town.

08:05.206 --> 08:06.448
But out of season,

08:06.482 --> 08:08.758
the transport
system is a far cry

08:08.793 --> 08:10.896
from the well
connected coastal routes

08:10.931 --> 08:14.034
found in other parts
of Latin America.

08:14.068 --> 08:16.275
She never left in
first place before.

08:17.310 --> 08:20.000
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, you all right?

08:20.034 --> 08:24.413
-I think it was bird shit. Oh, no!
-Ah! That's good luck.

08:24.448 --> 08:27.620
Yeah, lucky if you
see more. Oh, god.

08:27.655 --> 08:30.379
Winning will make a
massive difference to our lives.

08:30.413 --> 08:33.793
- We've bought a house which needs kind of cosmetic work.
- A lot.

08:33.827 --> 08:37.206
-It's awful. Brown carpet, brown towels.
-Brown toilet seat.

08:37.241 --> 08:42.793
- I would De-brown the house.
- Not achievable, unless we win some moneys.

08:42.827 --> 08:45.724
We've chosen to do this
because we know at the other end

08:45.758 --> 08:49.241
we're going to be a stronger
team and bonded for life.

08:49.275 --> 08:52.137
- Offices, when do they open?
- [In Spanish]

08:52.172 --> 08:53.482
Six. Okay.

08:55.137 --> 08:59.379
This is frustrating. Not quite
how I thought the leg would start.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.448
Well, no choice,
being in the lead.

09:02.482 --> 09:05.620
[Narrator] With four hours
until the ticket office opens...

09:05.655 --> 09:07.310
Could have actually
just stayed in bed.

09:07.344 --> 09:09.620
You're not going to get
in your sleeping bag?

09:09.655 --> 09:11.310
No. We'll have to take shifts.

09:11.344 --> 09:14.689
[Narrator] Jen and Rob's
lead could be short lived.

09:14.724 --> 09:17.724
- £20,000.
- £20,000, is it?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.310
All come down to this.

09:19.344 --> 09:22.068
[Narrator] Next to leave the
checkpoint four hours after the leaders,

09:22.103 --> 09:23.413
emon and jamiul.

09:23.448 --> 09:25.620
So we're gonna go
coastal patagonia, yeah?

09:25.655 --> 09:28.655
Bahia blanca, it's
more of a touristy route.

09:28.689 --> 09:31.827
Tourist routes tend to
be quite well connected.

09:31.862 --> 09:35.758
Yeah, then we'll have a better
chance of making headway faster.

09:35.793 --> 09:39.275
It was pretty touch and go, thinking
that we might never make it into mendoza.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.482
Just happy that we
might make it to ushuaia.

09:41.517 --> 09:42.758
If we could make it to the end,

09:42.793 --> 09:44.389
we've actually got a chance
of winning the race now.

09:44.413 --> 09:45.586
- Yeah.
- We have.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.344
We are feeling confident.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.172
[Narrator] Of the
remaining teams,

09:49.206 --> 09:53.344
they have the least
money left, less than £200.

09:53.379 --> 09:56.034
- It's a long way to go.
- It's a heck of a long way to go.

09:56.068 --> 10:00.034
The budget that we have, I don't think
it will get us all the way to ushuaia.

10:00.068 --> 10:01.517
We're still gonna have to work.

10:01.551 --> 10:03.482
Ola. bus terminal?

10:03.517 --> 10:05.310
Winning the race
will be fantastic.

10:05.344 --> 10:08.758
It's not just the money, it's
about winning it with my nephew.

10:08.793 --> 10:11.413
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

10:11.448 --> 10:16.586
The pressure will test us,
it'll grow our relationship.

10:17.862 --> 10:18.862
Oh, my god.

10:19.689 --> 10:22.137
- Uh, hello.
- What's going on?

10:22.172 --> 10:25.103
-Have you guys booked yet?
-No, not yet. It just this second opened.

10:25.137 --> 10:28.103
- We're just getting prices.
- Let's get prices...

10:31.137 --> 10:34.448
Lead's gone. Never
mind. It is what it is.

10:34.482 --> 10:36.631
[Rob] I think we've proven in
the last leg that we can do it,

10:36.655 --> 10:38.862
and we can beat the other teams.

10:38.896 --> 10:40.379
- We just need to do it again.
- Yeah.

10:40.413 --> 10:43.379
We'd like to go to neuquen.

10:43.413 --> 10:45.517
[Narrator] To regain
their slender advantage,

10:45.551 --> 10:49.896
Jen and Rob book seats on the
next bus heading south to neuquen,

10:49.931 --> 10:52.413
795 kilometers away

10:52.448 --> 10:55.068
deciding to plan the rest
of their route from there.

10:55.103 --> 10:58.000
[Jen] It's not the cheapest, but
we've taken it 'cause it's the earliest.

10:58.034 --> 11:00.931
Now I'm thinking should we
have got on a later, cheaper bus

11:00.965 --> 11:03.896
that maybe would have had a
better connection albeit tomorrow.

11:06.068 --> 11:08.137
We're trying to
get to the coast.

11:08.172 --> 11:10.793
I need to go to bahia blanca.

11:10.827 --> 11:14.310
[Narrator] Certain of their
plan to travel along the coast...

11:14.344 --> 11:18.034
[Woman in Spanish]

11:21.724 --> 11:24.379
emon and jamiul
spot an opportunity.

11:24.413 --> 11:28.172
- What are you thinking, man?
- Stay in mendoza, working here,

11:28.206 --> 11:31.724
and then get, we possibly
kind of lose 12 hours.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.137
Well, at least we
get a bit of working.

11:34.172 --> 11:35.620
I feel like if we do work here,

11:35.655 --> 11:38.172
then get a bus, we
just move in faster.

11:38.206 --> 11:41.379
- The price...
- [Woman in Spanish]

11:43.586 --> 11:45.758
I think everyone's
budget is suffering.

11:45.793 --> 11:48.448
Obviously, we lost Jo and
Sam because of the budget.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.517
Altogether, that's 6,420.

11:51.551 --> 11:53.551
It's a long way to go,
many miles to cover.

11:53.586 --> 11:56.862
Miles is money we spend.

11:56.896 --> 11:59.862
- On the way, we get food?
- [Woman speaks Spanish]

11:59.896 --> 12:03.586
- No food?
- Oh, okay.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.448
That's disappointing, with all
the money that we just spent.

12:06.482 --> 12:10.068
[Narrator] Opting for a bus that
doesn't leave for another 12 hours...

12:10.103 --> 12:12.379
[Jamiul] Let's make
some money, man.

12:12.413 --> 12:15.551
The boys plan to bankroll
a sprint to the finish line

12:15.586 --> 12:19.620
by working at the stables
on the outskirts of mendoza.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.517
[Emon] We have made a risky
move to stay in mendoza today.

12:22.551 --> 12:27.344
The pay for this job is 2,300
Argentinean pesos each.

12:27.379 --> 12:31.034
Our tickets going down
south cost just a bit over 3,000.

12:31.068 --> 12:34.068
So it's something that
we desperately need.

12:34.103 --> 12:37.724
Feels quite good to be a
professional shit shoveler.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.551
- [Narrator] Uncle and nephew...
- Let's do this!

12:42.586 --> 12:45.172
Began the race
as virtual strangers.

12:45.206 --> 12:49.103
In the past ten years, I don't think
we've spent a full day together.

12:49.137 --> 12:52.034
[Narrator] And at first,
they didn't see eye to eye.

12:52.068 --> 12:54.344
Just clean the bits
that people can see.

12:54.379 --> 12:56.586
[Emon] You should always
work as hard as possible.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.320
I guess he hasn't been in my life too
much to realize that that's who I am.

12:59.344 --> 13:02.068
[Narrator] But as their
knowledge of each other grew...

13:02.103 --> 13:04.182
[Jamiul] End of the day, you need
someone to break them boundaries

13:04.206 --> 13:05.758
to redeem myself.

13:05.793 --> 13:08.103
I understand. Give me a bro hug.

13:08.137 --> 13:10.344
Much nicer to do
things like this now,

13:10.379 --> 13:13.241
especially that there isn't this
thing in the back of our minds.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.217
[Narrator] ...So did their
confidence in the race.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.241
[Emon] The race
is all about gambles.

13:17.275 --> 13:18.965
When we did it
before, it paid off.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.206
[Jamiul] When you do it
before, I wasn't there though.

13:21.241 --> 13:23.586
- Is that it?
- This is it. Gracias.

13:24.275 --> 13:25.724
[Indistinct]

13:28.620 --> 13:29.724
Go on, young lad.

13:29.758 --> 13:31.827
This is what it's
all been boiling up.

13:31.862 --> 13:34.700
So in the final leg, you gotta make bold
decisions. You gotta make bold moves.

13:34.724 --> 13:36.148
And I'm hoping it
does payoff for us.

13:36.172 --> 13:37.827
Don't you be kicking me.

13:37.862 --> 13:39.862
- All right.
- [Horse grunts]

13:39.896 --> 13:42.275
[Narrator] While emon
and jamiul stay put...

13:43.758 --> 13:45.493
[Lizzie] All right, we
gotta be the nicest we can,

13:45.517 --> 13:48.413
we can get as much
help as physically possible.

13:48.448 --> 13:51.344
[Narrator]... dom and Lizzie
are the last to get going.

13:51.379 --> 13:54.103
We are in mendoza,
ushuaia's down here.

13:54.137 --> 13:57.000
[Narrator] Nine hours
behind the leaders.

13:57.034 --> 13:59.000
I'm wanting to win.
I'm coming to get you.

13:59.034 --> 14:00.620
I want to put the
pressure on them.

14:00.655 --> 14:04.275
I want them to look over their shoulders
and think, "where's dom and Lizzie?"

14:04.310 --> 14:06.517
[Narrator] But with money
worries of their own...

14:06.551 --> 14:08.838
[Lizzie] We haven't got enough money
right now to go straight to ushuaia.

14:08.862 --> 14:10.068
That is just not possible.

14:10.103 --> 14:12.206
But we have enough
money to get to neuquen.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.793
We can work in neuquen.

14:13.827 --> 14:16.379
-There's a job there. Almond plantation.
-[Dom] Yeah.

14:16.413 --> 14:19.344
The good thing about working,
you end up chatting to locals,

14:19.379 --> 14:21.172
they have local
knowledge of the area.

14:21.206 --> 14:24.068
Neuquen, we might
be able to hitchhike.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.034
Our change in strategy
in the last two legs

14:28.068 --> 14:31.000
to communicate with locals
more and use local knowledge

14:31.034 --> 14:33.275
was the reason why
we caught up so much.

14:33.310 --> 14:36.517
- [Man] These ones are the bus tickets.
- [Lizzie] Thank you.

14:36.551 --> 14:39.931
We really do have something
to prove not just to ourselves,

14:39.965 --> 14:41.551
but mum and dad,

14:41.586 --> 14:44.172
they sometimes believe that
we were just wading through life

14:44.206 --> 14:46.275
- a little bit carelessly.
- Yeah.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.275
- Oh!
- I want to show not just mum and dad,

14:48.310 --> 14:51.724
but everyone else that we can
actually achieve something big.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.103
[Narrator] Like Jen and Rob,

14:53.137 --> 14:55.586
the siblings are also
heading to neuquen.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.655
Aiming to improve their finances

14:57.689 --> 15:00.586
by taking a job there
on an almond plantation.

15:00.620 --> 15:01.931
Well, this is it.

15:01.965 --> 15:05.103
- We've kicked off our final leg.
- Oh my god.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.448
We are willing to
win whatever it takes.

15:08.482 --> 15:12.344
[Dom] Hopefully, like, jamiul and
emon get stuck on a broken bus

15:12.379 --> 15:14.758
and Rob and Jen
snap their ankles.

15:14.793 --> 15:16.137
[Lizzie] Oh!

15:18.793 --> 15:21.172
[Church bell rings]

15:23.206 --> 15:25.965
We haven't shared a single
bed for a long time, have we?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.760
I don't think we've ever
shared a single bed.

15:30.448 --> 15:33.000
[Narrator] Jen and Rob
stayed the night in neuquen,

15:33.034 --> 15:35.068
the largest city in patagonia.

15:36.551 --> 15:38.965
[Jen] No shampoo left. No
lip balm. That's gone today.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.862
This is the last
of a hand cream.

15:40.896 --> 15:44.000
[Narrator] Ahead of the other
teams, with the most money remaining,

15:44.034 --> 15:47.413
but in two minds about
where to head next.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.137
[Jen] Coastal is the
most obvious route.

15:50.172 --> 15:52.517
That's like a hundred
percent a good route.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.586
The trouble is that
we need to work out

15:54.620 --> 15:56.482
how we're going
to get to the end.

15:56.517 --> 15:58.137
[Jen] Right. New plan then.

15:58.172 --> 16:01.206
[Rob] Go to bariloche,
pick up some work.

16:01.241 --> 16:05.206
[Jen] Very well paid, but we're
going to miss out on all the nature,

16:05.241 --> 16:06.655
all the best bits.

16:06.689 --> 16:09.689
Penguins everywhere. The penguin
to person ratio is crazy. [Laughs]

16:09.724 --> 16:14.275
- [Rob] I don't think moneywise we have any options.
- [Sighs] How disappointing.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.586
[Narrator] To further
add to their funds...

16:16.620 --> 16:18.793
[Jen] My trousers
are in my bottom.

16:18.827 --> 16:21.586
[Narrator] they're traveling
to the ski resort of bariloche

16:21.620 --> 16:24.310
for a job in the
foothills of the andes.

16:24.827 --> 16:26.620
Bariloche...

16:26.655 --> 16:29.379
Um, at this one, the cheap one.

16:29.413 --> 16:31.896
So we think we're gonna run
out of money going the quick route.

16:31.931 --> 16:34.068
So we're gonna go
the mountainous route.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.655
[Jen] And it's bed and breakfast
and it pays particularly well.

16:36.689 --> 16:38.862
So this is a sensible
plan in terms of money.

16:38.896 --> 16:42.068
[Rob] That's pretty much been
our strategy from the start, hasn't it?

16:42.103 --> 16:45.724
[Narrator] As Jen and Rob
venture into the heart of patagonia...

16:47.724 --> 16:50.275
I can actually sleep well in
buses now, I've mastered the art.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.275
[Narrator] Traveling
through the night,

16:52.310 --> 16:54.896
the last team to
get out of mendoza

16:54.931 --> 16:59.517
emon and jamiul have reached
Argentina's Atlantic coast.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.527
[Jamiul] I hope he won't spend
that much time in bahia blanca.

17:01.551 --> 17:03.103
I just don't wanna
get another bus.

17:04.655 --> 17:08.103
[Narrator] Named for the color
of the soil surrounding its shores,

17:08.137 --> 17:12.103
bahia blanca, the white
bay is the jumping off point

17:12.137 --> 17:14.586
for exploring
patagonia's rugged coast.

17:16.965 --> 17:19.241
[Jamiul] It's
looking a bit dead.

17:19.275 --> 17:22.517
It seems like a
bit of a ghost town.

17:22.551 --> 17:25.655
Is there anyway we can get a
bus down south leaving now?

17:25.689 --> 17:27.182
- [Woman] No.
- All buses are in the night time?

17:27.206 --> 17:29.551
- Yes. At night.
- [Both groaning]

17:29.586 --> 17:30.517
Bahia blanca, man.

17:30.551 --> 17:33.689
- Okay. No problem. Gracias.
- Gracias.

17:33.724 --> 17:36.551
I think it might have been a mad
move coming here, I don't know, man.

17:36.586 --> 17:39.724
Because I don't think waiting
around for 14 hours is good enough.

17:41.310 --> 17:45.137
We took a risk to stay in mendoza
on work and then get a later bus.

17:45.172 --> 17:46.769
Right now, it does
seem like a bad decision.

17:46.793 --> 17:49.275
We've come here. It
seems that we're stuck.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.803
I'm not really sure
what we're gonna do.

17:50.827 --> 17:53.551
We need to try to find
work here or try to find a lift.

17:53.586 --> 17:55.241
We can try and hitchhike.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.793
Yeah, like, people, we need
to see which way they're going.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.275
[Laughing]

17:59.310 --> 18:02.620
In the UK, I do see
people hitchhiking.

18:02.655 --> 18:04.000
But I just go drive past them.

18:05.068 --> 18:07.517
[Horn honking]

18:07.551 --> 18:10.000
- Can you give us a lift?
- Oh, come on.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.493
I've never really
done it my whole life.

18:11.517 --> 18:13.448
It's gonna be
something new for me.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.896
35 degrees heat,
dust everywhere.

18:16.931 --> 18:18.413
Let's go back to
where we were, man.

18:18.448 --> 18:21.551
Yeah, just be
careful on this road.

18:21.586 --> 18:22.862
Look right, look right.

18:22.896 --> 18:26.137
- That's the city we were raised.
- [Man speaking in Spanish]

18:34.689 --> 18:35.758
Okay.

18:35.793 --> 18:38.689
- Service station.
- We can hitchhike it.

18:38.724 --> 18:42.965
[Narrator] The small town of rio
Colorado lies 200 kilometers inland.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.137
Meaning the boys
abandoning their plan

18:45.172 --> 18:48.034
of hopping from town
to town along the coast.

18:51.413 --> 18:52.586
Shall we do it?

18:52.620 --> 18:55.137
We might get there, there's
no buses in the evening.

18:55.172 --> 18:57.413
Either we take it or we
go back to bus terminal.

18:59.275 --> 19:00.931
Things get tough out there.

19:00.965 --> 19:05.241
I wouldn't want to let my nephew
down, so I'll do whatever it takes.

19:05.275 --> 19:08.620
[Emon] If it's a smaller town, there
will be less buses going through it?

19:08.655 --> 19:10.344
It's going to be like this, man.

19:10.379 --> 19:12.689
[Jamiul] I think this
move is too risky.

19:12.724 --> 19:14.034
Personally.

19:14.068 --> 19:17.275
- So we not do it then?
- I don't think so. No.

19:17.310 --> 19:18.896
It's too much of a
risk to take, man.

19:20.586 --> 19:23.310
[Emon] Oh, where's the time.

19:23.344 --> 19:25.827
It's frustration, really. Things
has done us over a little bit.

19:25.862 --> 19:29.241
Uh, we need to make faster
decisions to get to ushuaia.

19:29.275 --> 19:31.827
So I really think we've
just messed up to be fair.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.206
[Jamiul] That's
the bus terminal,

19:33.241 --> 19:35.010
- let's just hope there's tickets for those.
- Yeah.

19:35.034 --> 19:37.896
[Narrator] With the
boys stuck on the coast,

19:37.931 --> 19:42.068
newly arrived in
neuquen, dom and Lizzie.

19:42.103 --> 19:43.551
[Dom] Come on. [Grunts]

19:43.586 --> 19:45.482
- Oh, there we go.
- [Man] It's okay.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.793
Oh, yeah, it's got it.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.137
- There we go. [Chuckles]
- All the way.

19:51.172 --> 19:53.827
[Narrator] Stopping to
improve their dwindling funds,

19:53.862 --> 19:59.103
they're helping to install an irrigation
system on Johnny's almond plantation.

19:59.137 --> 20:01.413
[Lizzie] It feels weird to
be in the middle of a farm.

20:01.448 --> 20:03.517
When we've got a
race to think about.

20:03.551 --> 20:06.482
This'd the last leg. This is so
important that we get to the end.

20:06.517 --> 20:09.206
- Do you think everyone else is working?
- [Dom] I dunno, actually.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.137
- We just popped it from there.
- [Lizzie] If we didn't have any work,

20:12.172 --> 20:16.103
we'd be finishing the race in probably
two days. And not making it to the end.

20:16.137 --> 20:19.034
[Dom] Hence, why we're
working on an almond farm.

20:19.068 --> 20:20.551
[Lizzie] In the
boiling hot heat.

20:23.103 --> 20:24.413
[Dom] I feel sick.

20:24.448 --> 20:26.379
I think I might need
to sit down for a sec.

20:26.413 --> 20:27.758
[Sighs]

20:28.620 --> 20:31.000
Oh, this might not help but...

20:31.034 --> 20:33.758
[Narrator] With dom
struggling in 40 degree heat,

20:33.793 --> 20:35.344
the team medic steps in.

20:36.137 --> 20:37.482
[Man] Your blood pressure

20:38.310 --> 20:41.413
is quite low.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.310
[Dom] Comin' out here, I felt I
was a little bit invincible.[Chuckles]

20:44.344 --> 20:45.965
Clearly, I was wrong.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.862
The lack of proper sleep,

20:47.896 --> 20:51.931
proper foods, the
sun... [Indistinct]

20:51.965 --> 20:55.862
I'm dying to win.
Almost literally.

20:55.896 --> 20:57.551
[Lizzie] Oh my god!

20:57.586 --> 20:59.217
[Narrator] A previous
health scare in Peru...

20:59.241 --> 21:01.493
- [Lizzie] Is he going to be okay?
- [Man] How are you, dom?

21:01.517 --> 21:02.793
That was petrifying.

21:02.827 --> 21:05.000
[Narrator] Saw the
other teams pull away.

21:05.034 --> 21:07.034
[Dom] I never expected
us to be this far behind.

21:07.068 --> 21:09.793
I don't think you realize
how hard it was going to be.

21:09.827 --> 21:11.448
[Narrator] But the
bickering siblings...

21:11.482 --> 21:13.620
We just have to pull
ourselves together, I'm afraid.

21:13.655 --> 21:15.413
Just let me be angry.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.044
- [Narrator] ...Dug deep...
- [Lizzie] Run, dom.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.137
-[Narrator] To get back in the race.
-[Dom] Lizzie, come on!

21:20.172 --> 21:22.448
We've shown that
we can catch up.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.896
When we were younger, we were
so close, but we've grown apart.

21:24.931 --> 21:27.103
I would say we're siblings,
not friends anymore.

21:27.137 --> 21:30.586
- There's no better way to save our relationship than this.
- Hmm.

21:32.931 --> 21:36.379
[Dom] I'll be gutted if we're
not the first name in that book.

21:36.413 --> 21:38.596
I think we've had a tough race
and the sense of achievement

21:38.620 --> 21:40.655
just to complete
the race will be good,

21:40.689 --> 21:44.655
so we should be proud of ourselves
if and when we get to the finish.

21:46.689 --> 21:48.275
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:51.413 --> 21:52.862
[Narrator] Given
the all clear...

21:52.896 --> 21:55.241
- [Speaking foreign language]
- Thank you very much.

21:56.206 --> 21:57.827
Back to the bus station.

21:57.862 --> 22:00.413
[Narrator] ...Dom and Lizzie
immediately spend their earnings...

22:00.448 --> 22:05.137
I think we have, like, $18 left.

22:05.172 --> 22:08.379
[Narrator] ...On a night
bus to comodoro rivadavia,

22:08.413 --> 22:11.000
1,100km away.

22:11.862 --> 22:14.517
Hola. Want to get to San Julian.

22:14.551 --> 22:18.689
[Narrator] Also forking out after their
failed attempt to hitch out of town...

22:18.724 --> 22:21.103
- 2,600.
- Yeah, that's it.

22:21.137 --> 22:24.724
[Narrator] ...Emon and jamuil commit
over half of their remaining budget

22:24.758 --> 22:27.827
on a mammoth
journey to San Julian.

22:27.862 --> 22:30.113
- [Emon] I'm thinking that we'll have to work again.
- Yeah?

22:30.137 --> 22:31.310
-Yeah.

22:31.344 --> 22:32.689
We've got a fishing opportunity.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.424
We've been fishing before.
We've got experience.

22:34.448 --> 22:37.655
Yeah. It'd be good if it was something
on our route, which is something we need.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.206
Let's do that.

22:39.241 --> 22:41.931
Another night, another bus.

22:41.965 --> 22:44.517
I don't know about our
position right now in the race.

22:44.551 --> 22:49.586
The gap was so minimal between the
three teams. That's definitely changed now.

22:53.379 --> 22:57.241
[Narrator] 790km to the west...

22:57.275 --> 23:01.379
- Oh, cold.
- [Narrator] Jen and Rob wake up in the heart of patagonia.

23:04.586 --> 23:06.793
Bariloche is
famous for its fishing,

23:06.827 --> 23:11.172
- whitewater rafting, and bird watching.
- [Knock on door]

23:11.206 --> 23:14.310
Good morning. If you're
ready, we can start moving.

23:14.344 --> 23:15.527
[Narrator] And up
in the mountains,

23:15.551 --> 23:18.758
a growing number of
people are living off grid,

23:18.793 --> 23:23.000
like Steven, who needs
help with his water supply.

23:23.034 --> 23:24.862
[Steven] We walk
up to the wall thing.

23:24.896 --> 23:28.000
Basically we'll build
a new fence around it

23:28.034 --> 23:30.068
so no animals are
going to get into the tank.

23:30.103 --> 23:32.413
- They try and get to it to drink, do they?
- Yeah.

23:32.448 --> 23:34.000
[Steven] Okay.

23:34.034 --> 23:35.724
[Jen] I've never
built a fence before.

23:35.758 --> 23:38.448
My dad is gonna be so
proud when he sees this.

23:38.482 --> 23:40.448
I feel like this is
how Ikea started.

23:41.896 --> 23:44.344
Of course the race is still
very much on my mind.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.000
Is work the right thing to do?

23:46.034 --> 23:47.827
[Jen laughing]

23:47.862 --> 23:49.793
We've probably got more
money than anybody else,

23:49.827 --> 23:52.310
- but I just hope now it comes into fruition.
- Yeah.

23:52.344 --> 23:57.689
Ready! [Laughs] All about
the thigh muscles here.

23:57.724 --> 24:01.620
There's no point in getting to the
checkpoint last, and having, you know,

24:01.655 --> 24:03.172
a thousand pesos in your pocket.

24:03.206 --> 24:06.068
Aah! [Chuckles]

24:06.103 --> 24:08.596
[Steven] We'll just clear the
area and we'll bring this stuff up.

24:08.620 --> 24:11.379
I'm hearing through
the hearing aid.

24:11.413 --> 24:13.758
I might not be able to
hear you all the time.

24:15.379 --> 24:18.000
I don't like to make a big
thing of my loss of hearing

24:18.034 --> 24:19.965
so I don't generally warn people

24:20.000 --> 24:24.931
though when hammers, nails,
and machetes are involved,

24:24.965 --> 24:29.172
I probably should
mention it. [Laughs]

24:29.206 --> 24:32.931
How are we even going
to get, like, out of the city?

24:32.965 --> 24:35.251
[Rob] I think this journey will
challenge our communication, won't it?

24:35.275 --> 24:37.034
Robby, I'm trying
to speak to you.

24:37.068 --> 24:39.448
I can't hear you very
well. It's really noisy.

24:39.482 --> 24:41.068
[Narrator] After
a rocky start...

24:41.103 --> 24:42.665
[Rob] You're standing
there doing nothing.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.448
Fuck off. Standing
there doing nothing?

24:45.482 --> 24:47.379
You don't care how
you make me feel.

24:47.413 --> 24:50.586
[Narrator] ...Husband and
wife improved their teamwork...

24:50.620 --> 24:54.137
- [Rob] Watch your bum.
- Ooh, you sneaky little boy.

24:54.172 --> 24:55.724
[Rob] You can see
her confidence grow

24:55.758 --> 24:58.000
and that makes me
happy. [Chuckles]

24:58.034 --> 25:00.034
[Narrator] ...And
their place in the race.

25:00.068 --> 25:02.862
Every leg I've been getting like
braver and braver and braver.

25:02.896 --> 25:04.206
I'm canoeing!

25:04.241 --> 25:05.862
Get your foot in that door.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.034
- Oh!
- Oh, my god!

25:12.068 --> 25:14.655
Do not dare criticize
my hole digging skills.

25:14.689 --> 25:16.793
I'm not... I'm not
doing anything.

25:16.827 --> 25:18.724
My hole is so good.

25:18.758 --> 25:21.103
[Rob] I think you've got a
new career as a grave digger.

25:21.137 --> 25:22.793
[Laughing]

25:22.827 --> 25:24.000
[Rob] I think this challenge

25:24.034 --> 25:27.551
is an opportunity for us
to be forced into situations

25:27.586 --> 25:31.000
where we've had to learn
how to operate as a team.

25:31.034 --> 25:34.241
- [Jen] Yeah, that's good.
- Just being able to prove that we can do it

25:34.275 --> 25:37.827
and we can succeed
really molded us together.

25:37.862 --> 25:41.068
- What do you think?
- I am very impressed with this.

25:41.103 --> 25:42.241
Perfect.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.482
I think it's an incredible
piece of engineering myself.

25:47.655 --> 25:49.655
This has been one
of our favorite views.

25:49.689 --> 25:51.482
[Rob] Beautiful, isn't it?

25:52.758 --> 25:54.655
I feel like a proper team,

25:54.689 --> 25:58.172
and it fills me with confidence

25:58.206 --> 26:02.275
that we've got such a
amazing life ahead of us.

26:04.413 --> 26:07.000
[Narrator] While Jen and
Rob descend the mountain...

26:07.724 --> 26:09.862
Oh, my god! No way!

26:09.896 --> 26:10.965
There's a dinosaur.

26:11.896 --> 26:14.275
Dinosaurs still
live in patagonia.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.172
[Lizzie] Is that where
dinosaurs are from?

26:17.206 --> 26:19.137
[Dom] They're from
all over the world.

26:19.172 --> 26:20.551
[Narrator] Overtaking them,

26:20.586 --> 26:24.344
dom and Lizzie on their overnight
bus to comodoro rivadavia,

26:24.379 --> 26:27.206
looking to keep
moving to rio gallegos,

26:27.241 --> 26:30.724
778km along the coast.

26:30.758 --> 26:34.000
The further south we go,
the chillier it's going to get.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.172
Who needs a coat when
you're from Yorkshire?

26:39.206 --> 26:40.551
- Hello.
- Hello.

26:40.586 --> 26:42.965
- Rio gallegos?
- [Man speaking foreign language]

26:46.034 --> 26:47.655
That's eight o'clock.

26:49.724 --> 26:51.793
[Man speaking foreign language]

26:51.827 --> 26:55.689
[Dom] 1,995. Can we afford this?

26:55.724 --> 26:58.862
[Narrator] But with barely 100
pounds of their budget remaining,

26:58.896 --> 27:01.827
a local job in the
directory may be tempting.

27:01.862 --> 27:05.620
[Dom] We have the
option to see if we can work.

27:05.655 --> 27:09.275
However, that would mean
working tomorrow, which is an issue.

27:09.310 --> 27:11.862
Probably put us
way back in the race.

27:11.896 --> 27:15.103
The other option is get a
bus at eight o'clock tonight,

27:15.137 --> 27:19.068
which will cost us about half
our budget for the rest of the race.

27:19.103 --> 27:22.172
If we make the right
decision, we could come first.

27:22.206 --> 27:26.241
Or if we get this wrong, we might
not finish the race whatsoever.

27:26.275 --> 27:30.206
I'd rather have no regrets
and know that I took the risk.

27:30.241 --> 27:33.586
- Are you happy with that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.803
We're not going to eat now
for like three days, you know?

27:35.827 --> 27:37.931
- No.
- Not one thing.

27:37.965 --> 27:39.551
[Narrator] Rio gallegos,

27:39.586 --> 27:43.137
the last town before leaving
the Argentinean mainland behind

27:43.172 --> 27:48.689
to enter tierra del fuego, an
eleven hour, 750km journey

27:48.724 --> 27:51.517
that could see the
siblings leap into the lead.

27:51.551 --> 27:54.034
[Lizzie] Stuff the money.
We will make it to the end.

27:54.068 --> 27:56.827
We're not settling for
less than first. Stuff that.

27:58.517 --> 28:01.241
God, this is risky.

28:01.275 --> 28:04.448
[Narrator] Leaving bariloche
behind with a healthier budget...

28:04.482 --> 28:06.620
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

28:06.655 --> 28:09.172
[Narrator] ...Jen and ro
b strike out for the coast.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.068
And after 40 hours on buses...

28:12.103 --> 28:14.862
- Christian? Emon.
- Jamiul?

28:14.896 --> 28:18.827
[Narrator] ...Emon and jamiul
arrive at San Julian in the race lead...

28:20.448 --> 28:22.068
What a beautiful
home you've got.

28:22.103 --> 28:24.448
[Narrator] ...But stop to
join fisherman Christian

28:24.482 --> 28:26.482
for a shift on his boat
tomorrow morning.

28:26.517 --> 28:29.827
[Christian] For this
day, it's your home.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.596
[Narrator] They may have
a free bed for the night...

28:33.620 --> 28:37.379
Slept in some peculiar places
in my life, but this is a first for me.

28:37.413 --> 28:39.379
[Narrator] ...But won't
be sleeping alone.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.758
[Emon] Oh, my god.

28:41.793 --> 28:43.313
[Whispering] They're
all staring at us.

28:49.172 --> 28:51.137
Oof! It's very cold.

28:51.172 --> 28:53.172
Wow. That's minky.

28:56.655 --> 29:00.310
[Narrator] The natural
harbor of puerto San Julian.

29:00.344 --> 29:05.137
The Spanish described the natives
they encountered here as giants,

29:05.172 --> 29:07.931
leading, some say,
to the region's name,

29:07.965 --> 29:12.586
patagonia, land of the big feet.

29:12.620 --> 29:16.344
[Jamuil] We've been in some hot
hot weather since North America.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.965
This is the only cold that
we've actually probably felt.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.827
Very different from the
fishing with Santos and John.

29:21.862 --> 29:25.586
I guess they've all got
their own styles of fishing.

29:25.620 --> 29:28.655
Oh, the seagulls are coming
in, trying to Rob all the fish.

29:28.689 --> 29:31.965
[Speaking foreign language]

29:32.000 --> 29:36.827
[Narrator] With just 70 pounds left,
but almost 1,000km still to travel...

29:36.862 --> 29:38.655
Pull it in more, on the side.

29:38.689 --> 29:42.655
[Narrator] ...Uncle and nephew attempt
to improve their cash flow one final time.

29:43.827 --> 29:45.068
[Speaking foreign language]

29:45.103 --> 29:48.724
Oh, my gosh! A big haul. Wow!

29:48.758 --> 29:50.137
Get them in the boat!

29:50.172 --> 29:52.655
I've never seen that
many fish in my life.

29:52.689 --> 29:56.620
Right, that's our meal done
for the day now. [Laughs]

29:56.655 --> 30:00.068
Need to figure out
our next move properly.

30:00.103 --> 30:02.655
[Emon] We've got a
chance to get to ushuaia,

30:02.689 --> 30:06.275
- something that I didn't see for myself yesterday.
- [Jamuil] We've done well.

30:08.068 --> 30:10.206
I really want to
finish off with a bang.

30:16.206 --> 30:19.310
[Narrator] Lagging behind after
the detour into the mountains...

30:19.344 --> 30:21.448
[Jen] Chilly out here.

30:21.482 --> 30:24.586
[Narrator] ...Jen and Rob have
reached comodoro rivadavia,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.965
desperate to keep moving.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.827
We can get to rio gallegos for eight in
the morning. That's as far as we can get.

30:30.862 --> 30:35.137
Please, can we book rio
gallegos at half past eight, please?

30:35.172 --> 30:36.758
[Speaking foreign language]

30:36.793 --> 30:38.206
Thank you.

30:38.241 --> 30:40.965
[Narrator] But their
plans may be thwarted...

30:41.000 --> 30:42.379
[Electricity crackling]

30:42.413 --> 30:45.689
[Jen] Oh, no! Power out.

30:45.724 --> 30:48.586
[Narrator] By a higher power.

30:48.620 --> 30:52.034
Please come back
on. The power's gone.

30:52.068 --> 30:54.310
Just as they were putting
in our passport information,

30:54.344 --> 30:58.241
all the power in the whole
of Argentina cuts out.

30:58.275 --> 31:01.206
What are the chances? How
are we going to get the tickets?

31:01.241 --> 31:03.586
[Rob] This sprint finish
isn't really working out, is it?

31:03.620 --> 31:04.620
[Jen] No, it's terrible.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.551
First, she gets the
tickets, and then you pay.

31:07.586 --> 31:09.448
[Jen] But there's no computer,

31:09.482 --> 31:11.724
so how are we
gonna get the tickets?

31:12.310 --> 31:15.517
She's going to her home.

31:15.551 --> 31:18.000
- Oh, okay.
- And she's going to...

31:18.034 --> 31:19.724
- Book the tickets for us.
- Yeah.

31:19.758 --> 31:22.310
That is where
anything will be wrong.

31:22.344 --> 31:23.758
Okay, do we wait here?

31:23.793 --> 31:25.758
- Yes.
- [Speaking foreign language]

31:25.793 --> 31:27.482
- Okay.
- Okay. Great.

31:27.517 --> 31:28.896
She's taken my passport.

31:28.931 --> 31:31.517
Okay. Brilliant. No
record of the booking.

31:33.172 --> 31:34.941
[Jen] We've been stood
here waiting for the woman.

31:34.965 --> 31:36.862
We may or may not
have passports anymore.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.379
[Rob] May or may not have
a bus out of here anymore.

31:39.413 --> 31:43.448
- Oh, my days.
- Have faith, Jen.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.137
Have faith.

31:47.482 --> 31:50.034
She's back. [Chuckles]

31:50.068 --> 31:53.000
- So the seat is booked? Ah!
- Yes.

31:53.034 --> 31:54.862
You're so kind.

31:54.896 --> 31:57.000
So we're definitely on the bus.

31:57.034 --> 31:59.448
- Okay. [Sighs dramatically]
- [Chuckles]

31:59.482 --> 32:03.103
[Jen] Never, really, before this
race, put my trust in strangers.

32:03.137 --> 32:04.517
She went home to book them.

32:04.551 --> 32:07.655
- I know, that's very kind of her.
- Very kind of her.

32:07.689 --> 32:09.970
[Jen] So it just shows that
actually don't mistrust people.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.655
It's just so humbling.

32:11.689 --> 32:15.241
And it's because of people like that that
you have the strength to then carry on.

32:15.275 --> 32:17.724
Going up.

32:17.758 --> 32:21.827
[Narrator] Jen and Rob depart on
their 11 hour journey to rio gallegos.

32:21.862 --> 32:23.275
[Lizzie] It's chilly.

32:23.310 --> 32:27.034
[Narrator] New race leaders
dom and Lizzie are already there.

32:28.689 --> 32:32.551
Their gamble having paid off,
they've leap frogged the other teams.

32:34.206 --> 32:35.586
- Hello.
- Hello.

32:36.827 --> 32:38.758
- [Dom] To ushuaia.
- [Lizzie] Today.

32:40.482 --> 32:41.862
No.

32:41.896 --> 32:43.482
- Oh, fuck.
- Not today.

32:43.517 --> 32:45.344
No. No.

32:45.379 --> 32:47.965
- Or rio grande.
- [Lizzie] Rio grande?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.931
- Rio grande.
- [Lizzie] Today?

32:49.965 --> 32:51.379
- No.
- [Dom] Not today.

32:51.413 --> 32:55.241
- Not today.
- Is there nowhere else, no way to get to rio grande?

32:55.275 --> 32:58.068
-No, not today.
-No, only... [Speaking indistinctly]

32:58.103 --> 32:59.448
No bus, no.

32:59.482 --> 33:02.172
[Narrator] The next
available bus is to rio grande,

33:02.206 --> 33:04.827
the capital of tierra del fuego.

33:04.862 --> 33:08.379
It's within striking
distance of ushuaia,

33:08.413 --> 33:11.862
but it doesn't leave until
9:30 tomorrow morning.

33:13.379 --> 33:16.758
- [Lizzie] Or we can hitchhike and get there earlier.
- Could do.

33:16.793 --> 33:21.275
But they have to then take
us across on the boat as well.

33:22.965 --> 33:25.896
- What you want to do?
- Let's just do this.

33:27.034 --> 33:30.241
Let's just book
it. It's 1,800 each.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.793
So that's 3,600.

33:31.827 --> 33:33.413
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:33.448 --> 33:36.655
That's more expenses
and more time lost.

33:36.689 --> 33:39.448
[Narrator] With 22 hours
till their bus tomorrow,

33:39.482 --> 33:43.551
the siblings are stuck with
just 34 pounds to their name.

33:44.448 --> 33:46.517
We need to earn some money today

33:46.551 --> 33:49.310
in order to sleep,
and eat. [Chuckles]

33:49.344 --> 33:53.137
[Dom] Probably the first time
ever I've had to actually work to eat.

33:53.172 --> 33:57.275
Do you know
anywhere in rio gallegos

33:57.310 --> 34:02.310
that maybe we could work for
the day, like a hotel or a restaurant?

34:04.689 --> 34:06.517
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:06.551 --> 34:09.551
[Lizzie] Really frustrating that
we can't leave rio gallegos tonight,

34:09.586 --> 34:12.068
but there's only one bus.
We don't really have a choice.

34:12.103 --> 34:14.044
And if we end up coming
last then we come in last,

34:14.068 --> 34:16.103
but we're still going
to cross the finish line.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.482
That's all that matters to me.

34:17.517 --> 34:19.034
Is it that way?

34:19.068 --> 34:20.655
Yeah.

34:20.689 --> 34:22.827
[Lizzie] I'm hoping we
meet one nice person.

34:24.689 --> 34:26.103
If this had been a few legs ago

34:26.137 --> 34:28.424
where I was having to beg
people to help, I would've given up.

34:28.448 --> 34:32.275
But now we're so close to the
end I'm like, [growls] I'll do anything.

34:32.310 --> 34:34.931
I'm just gonna say please
about one hundred times.

34:34.965 --> 34:37.034
Please, please, please,
please, please, please!

34:37.068 --> 34:38.310
Por favor.

34:39.413 --> 34:41.448
Cafe? Try there?

34:41.482 --> 34:43.137
- We could ask. Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:43.172 --> 34:46.103
[Dom] We are
looking for some work.

34:46.724 --> 34:48.862
Okay. De nada.

34:48.896 --> 34:51.689
- Don't worry. Muchos gracias.
- Muchos gracias.

34:51.724 --> 34:53.586
[Lizzie] Restaurante.

34:53.620 --> 34:56.586
[Dom] Yeah. We
have very little money.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.241
We're wondering if
there's any work here?

34:58.275 --> 35:01.034
- No. No.
- No, nothing at all? Okay.

35:01.068 --> 35:02.206
No worries.

35:02.241 --> 35:04.137
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Thank you.

35:04.172 --> 35:07.137
It'd help if we were
in a touristy place.

35:07.172 --> 35:10.758
Yeah, it doesn't seem like
they get many tourists here.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.586
Oh, a hotel there.
We can try this one.

35:15.379 --> 35:17.344
We have very little money.

35:17.379 --> 35:19.689
So we've been looking for work.

35:24.379 --> 35:29.103
- We are going to send you to a place turismo.
- And we can ask there?

35:29.137 --> 35:31.655
- Ask them. Yeah.
- [Lizzie] Thank you.

35:31.689 --> 35:35.000
[Narrator] While dom and Lizzie
pin their hopes on the tourist office...

35:36.275 --> 35:38.586
Closing in, emon and jamuil...

35:38.620 --> 35:40.275
You know what, that is

35:40.310 --> 35:43.034
- one of the best experiences we've had.
- Really, nice.

35:43.068 --> 35:46.517
[Narrator] ...Having managed to
secure a free ride with a fellow fisherman.

35:46.551 --> 35:49.241
It means a lot, man,
especially on our budget.

35:49.275 --> 35:51.344
The budget that we
have right now is not a lot.

35:51.379 --> 35:53.448
So you getting
us to rio gallegos,

35:53.482 --> 35:55.724
- it's a massive help.
- Yeah.

35:55.758 --> 35:58.103
So once we get to rio gallegos,

35:58.137 --> 36:02.068
we check whether or not we
can get straight to ushuaia as well.

36:05.137 --> 36:06.482
Here.

36:06.517 --> 36:07.862
So, just down here?

36:09.655 --> 36:12.068
- Si. Ah.
- Ah, gracias.

36:14.379 --> 36:15.655
- Hello?
- Hello.

36:15.689 --> 36:17.931
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

36:19.172 --> 36:21.689
- I don't really speak English.
- Okay.

36:21.724 --> 36:22.724
What do you need?

36:22.758 --> 36:26.068
We're looking for work
or food or... [chuckles]

36:26.103 --> 36:27.965
Wait a second. Walk in here.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.206
- Okay.
- I work for you.

36:29.241 --> 36:32.000
Okay. Thank you.

36:32.034 --> 36:34.034
[Man] Hola. You
want some coffee?

36:34.068 --> 36:36.103
Oh, that would be lovely.

36:36.137 --> 36:38.689
- Thank you.
- Yes, please.

36:40.379 --> 36:43.724
We were basically just trying
to find maybe some work.

36:43.758 --> 36:46.689
Transitory work is not
very common in this part.

36:46.724 --> 36:48.517
-Okay -okay, I understand.

36:48.551 --> 36:51.241
There is not a lot of
good cash you could grab.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.000
It's unlikely to find work here?

36:53.034 --> 36:54.517
- Yeah.
- Okay.

36:54.551 --> 36:56.482
[Man] That's not very common.

36:56.517 --> 37:01.448
I like to invite you to my
house to dinner tonight.

37:01.482 --> 37:03.379
- [Gasps] What? Really?
- You've got dinner?

37:03.413 --> 37:05.000
- Chicken.
- Yeah? Really.

37:05.034 --> 37:07.344
- We will take you.
- That's amazing.

37:07.379 --> 37:10.206
- Thank you so much.
- Honestly, we'd be so thankful.

37:10.241 --> 37:12.517
We are lucky sons of bitches.

37:12.551 --> 37:15.310
- I don't know what just happened.
- You wouldn't go on holiday

37:15.344 --> 37:18.148
and then end up going around some lady's
house for dinner with the family, would you?

37:18.172 --> 37:21.103
And I think that's
maybe what's special,

37:21.137 --> 37:23.310
- what we're getting out of this.
- Definitely.

37:23.344 --> 37:24.275
- Ha.
- We have...

37:24.310 --> 37:26.551
Ah. Okay.

37:26.586 --> 37:28.931
- [Dom] Mi casa...
- [Lizzie] Su casa.

37:29.965 --> 37:31.724
[Lizzie] Hola!

37:31.758 --> 37:33.620
[Speaking foreign language]

37:33.655 --> 37:36.620
- Nice to meet you.
- [Dom] Hola.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.206
[Speaking foreign
language] Dominic.

37:41.206 --> 37:44.206
- Look at the dog's peeking in.
- Look at his little face.

37:44.241 --> 37:45.586
[Dog whines]

37:45.620 --> 37:47.344
Yes, thank you very much.

37:47.379 --> 37:49.034
Si.yeah.

37:49.068 --> 37:52.172
-[Dom] Still kicking off in Chile.
-Oh, my god.

37:52.862 --> 37:54.413
[Indistinct chatter]

37:54.448 --> 37:57.000
When we arrived here this
morning, I did not expect this,

37:57.034 --> 37:58.514
this would be the
case in the evening.

38:00.172 --> 38:04.172
I think we're getting a true
Argentinean experience here.

38:06.793 --> 38:09.413
Oh, my god!

38:09.448 --> 38:13.551
- [Dom gasps]
- [Speaking foreign language]

38:13.586 --> 38:17.000
- [Lizzie] Shall we start?
- Yes, please.

38:17.034 --> 38:19.379
We haven't eaten
in like two days.

38:19.413 --> 38:22.000
This is muy bien.

38:26.241 --> 38:28.965
So why did you want to help us?

38:34.137 --> 38:37.103
- [Dom] The same way we do.
- Exactly.

38:43.206 --> 38:44.655
Yeah.

38:44.689 --> 38:48.724
So you do the same as how you'd
want your daughter to be helped.

38:48.758 --> 38:49.896
[Woman] Yes!

38:50.482 --> 38:52.551
Cheers! Salud!

38:52.586 --> 38:54.793
- To new friends! Salud!
- New friends!

38:54.827 --> 38:57.379
- Enjoy being in my country.
- Aw! Thank you.

38:57.413 --> 38:59.655
We've loved Argentina.

38:59.689 --> 39:02.344
It was actually one of the
nicest moments of the trip.

39:02.379 --> 39:05.344
I saw a lot of mom
and grandma in her.

39:05.379 --> 39:09.655
-Yeah. Find our St. Christophers.
-[Dom] Oh, yeah.

39:09.689 --> 39:13.862
We actually haven't got them out since mom
gave them to us. The Saint of safe travels.

39:13.896 --> 39:16.655
[Dom] I'm going to do my
own little adaptation on this.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.344
The patron Saint
of fast travels.

39:19.379 --> 39:23.655
- Uh-huh.
- So we get to ushuaia safely but in first place.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.827
[Lizzie] Yes. Okay.

39:29.310 --> 39:32.310
- [Dramatic music playing]
- [Indistinct chatter]

39:32.344 --> 39:36.068
- Get up. Time to get up.
- [Yawns]

39:36.103 --> 39:40.068
[Narrator] After a night on the hard
floor of rio gallegos' bus station...

39:40.103 --> 39:43.241
Oh, hello. It's
getting there, love.

39:43.275 --> 39:47.965
[Narrator] ...Emon and jamuil book
seats on the 9:30 A.M. bus to rio grande,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.965
unaware that rivals dom
and Lizzie will be on it too.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.344
[Emon] In this position of the race,
the last leg, literally the last day,

39:55.379 --> 39:57.896
the last a couple
hundred kilometers

39:57.931 --> 40:01.551
makes you very vulnerable because we've
made our move. We've bought the tickets.

40:03.413 --> 40:05.827
- [Jen] Oh, that's freezing.
- [Jamuil] Oh, they're here.

40:05.862 --> 40:09.241
- Oh, shit.
- [Lizzie] We must be really, really south.

40:09.275 --> 40:10.758
Jen and Rob are here.

40:10.793 --> 40:13.758
[Narrator] With the
bus about to depart...

40:13.793 --> 40:15.355
- This is awkward, isn't it?
- Jen and Rob are here.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.413
- [Narrator] ...New arrivals.
- Ooh!

40:17.448 --> 40:18.586
Hiya.

40:19.344 --> 40:20.655
What time are you leaving?

40:20.689 --> 40:22.137
- Um...
- Right now?

40:22.172 --> 40:23.586
Yeah. Well, yeah.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.413
Okay. I got a shift on then.

40:25.448 --> 40:27.620
We're missing a trick. Oh, god!

40:27.655 --> 40:30.413
I don't think there
will be any seats left.

40:30.448 --> 40:34.000
52 days of racing and
what it's all come down to...

40:34.034 --> 40:37.241
[Rob] We're neck and neck. I
think we're place one and two.

40:37.275 --> 40:41.206
Yeah, we've got a chance,
got a chance to win this.

40:41.241 --> 40:44.413
Well, it would be funny if dom
and Lizzie just strolled in behind me.

40:45.241 --> 40:47.896
[Lizzie] Oh, my god!

40:48.482 --> 40:49.482
Oh, my god!

40:49.517 --> 40:51.793
[Emon laughs] All
three of us here.

40:51.827 --> 40:54.034
Oh, no. This is nerve wracking.

40:54.068 --> 40:56.517
Oh, my goodness. Jen!

40:56.551 --> 40:58.620
- The others are inside.
- Shut up.

40:58.655 --> 41:01.172
- Oh, no way!
- Yeah!

41:01.206 --> 41:03.413
Oh, my days.

41:03.448 --> 41:05.724
- Mental.
- We've been here since yesterday morning.

41:05.758 --> 41:06.965
- You haven't!
- Yeah.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.793
- What the hell?
- They took the fast route.

41:08.827 --> 41:11.586
- They took the coastal route.
- No!

41:11.620 --> 41:13.379
[Dom] Everyone's here.

41:13.413 --> 41:15.172
And we're one stop from ushuaia.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.551
Let's just think about
what's just happened.

41:17.586 --> 41:20.896
We're the last, but it's okay
because everything's been reset now.

41:20.931 --> 41:23.103
[Rob] We've got loads of
money, so we need to spend it.

41:23.137 --> 41:26.931
- We need to make sure that we get ahead.
- Blow our money on a taxi.

41:28.344 --> 41:31.724
[Jen] Finally. Finally,
our strategy might pay off.

41:31.758 --> 41:35.379
[Narrator] With two teams having
booked their onward journey by bus...

41:35.413 --> 41:38.206
- You can't do it for 10,000?
- Eh...

41:38.241 --> 41:40.000
Thing is killing
me a little bit.

41:40.034 --> 41:43.586
[Emon] Just seeing
Rob at the old taxi stand.

41:43.620 --> 41:45.901
[Jamuil] I feel like they may
be able to afford it as well.

41:46.206 --> 41:48.965
[Rob] 18,000 pesos.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.793
[Narrator] Jen and
Rob need to stomp up

41:50.827 --> 41:55.793
255 pounds to make a
break for ushuaia by taxi.

41:55.827 --> 41:58.896
This is agonizing, this.

41:58.931 --> 42:01.310
One thousand. Two thousand.
Three thousand. Four thousand.

42:01.344 --> 42:05.517
Five thousand. Six
thousand. Thirteen. Fourteen.

42:05.551 --> 42:07.793
Two hundred. Three
hundred. Four hundred. Fifteen.

42:11.275 --> 42:12.586
[Rob] We don't have 18,000.

42:12.620 --> 42:15.965
- We have more like 15,000.
- Ooh, damn it!

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
[Narrator] 40 pounds
short and plan foiled.

42:20.034 --> 42:23.000
They'll be on the same
bus as the other teams.

42:23.034 --> 42:25.137
[Jen] Oh, interesting.

42:25.172 --> 42:26.827
This is it. This is it.

42:29.586 --> 42:34.862
God. It feels odd. We all started
in Mexico City 18,000km away.

42:34.896 --> 42:38.137
And now we're all
on the same bus.

42:39.379 --> 42:40.862
We need 6,000.

42:40.896 --> 42:44.137
This is what we'll
spend to get to ushuaia.

42:44.172 --> 42:47.586
And that is for anything
that happens along the way

42:47.620 --> 42:50.758
that is unexpected.

42:50.793 --> 42:56.000
[Narrator] To reach rio grande,
375km away, the teams enter Chile

42:57.689 --> 43:02.862
before catching a ferry across the
strait of Magellan to tierra del fuego.

43:05.103 --> 43:06.379
[Ship horn blowing]

43:06.413 --> 43:08.517
[Lizzie] Any ferry I'd
rather be on is to calais.

43:08.551 --> 43:09.862
Maybe we'll see whales.

43:11.413 --> 43:12.931
What, the country?

43:13.413 --> 43:16.206
[Alarm rings]

43:16.241 --> 43:20.482
It's been more challenging than
I ever would have ever imagined.

43:20.517 --> 43:22.251
[Rob] That win would
make it, wouldn't it, really?

43:22.275 --> 43:24.862
[Jen] Yeah. We're here at the
same time. We've got some money.

43:24.896 --> 43:28.206
We've got a plan. We've got each
other. No reason we can't smash it.

43:29.655 --> 43:30.941
[Lizzie] You know
me. I'm not competitive.

43:30.965 --> 43:33.620
- But I want to win, though.
- Oh, 100%.

43:33.655 --> 43:37.103
Like, just to open that book, and
no one's name's written down yet.

43:37.137 --> 43:40.482
That feeling of elation that everything
we've gone through has been worth it.

43:40.517 --> 43:42.241
[Groans] I want to win.

43:43.379 --> 43:45.310
[Emon] At the start
we were strangers,

43:45.344 --> 43:48.689
but the last 50 days we've got
closer. Now we know what we can do,

43:48.724 --> 43:51.444
and we got to utilize that, not
rush into it like we did at the start.

43:53.655 --> 43:57.896
[Suspenseful music playing]

44:00.034 --> 44:03.655
[Narrator] Back on dry land,
then back into Argentina,

44:03.689 --> 44:06.206
the teams close
in on rio grande,

44:06.241 --> 44:11.827
210km from the southernmost
city in the world, ushuaia.

44:11.862 --> 44:16.517
To get there, the teams will need
to tackle the andes one last time,

44:16.551 --> 44:19.965
their constant companion since
they entered South America.

44:25.517 --> 44:27.320
-[Lizzie] Gonna hitchhike. We'll hitchhike.
-[Dom] Yeah.

44:27.344 --> 44:29.000
Go, go, go.

44:30.034 --> 44:32.724
- All right, let's go and get a taxi.
- Shh.

44:34.448 --> 44:37.413
Can you take us to the tram?

44:37.448 --> 44:38.769
[Lizzie] They're
both getting taxis.

44:38.793 --> 44:41.206
- It's all right, Lizzie, relax.
- Right on.

44:41.241 --> 44:42.517
Ushuaia?

44:42.551 --> 44:46.724
- Is this a taxi?
- Let's go. Vamonos, vamonos.

44:46.758 --> 44:48.278
[Jen] Get your bag
in. Get your bag in.

44:48.310 --> 44:50.689
- Let me see that.
- [Groans]

44:50.724 --> 44:52.689
I don't have this much.

44:52.724 --> 44:55.241
I've got... I don't have this.

44:55.275 --> 44:59.241
[Speaking foreign language] [In
English] Six-four-oh-oh. Si, si. Gracias.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.655
Well within budget.

45:01.689 --> 45:03.424
Poor Lizzie and dom
are still at the bus station,

45:03.448 --> 45:08.068
so it is absolutely a fight
between jamiul, emon, robby and I.

45:08.103 --> 45:10.344
They have always been
our biggest competitors.

45:10.379 --> 45:14.103
But today, I'm not letting
anything stand in my way.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.896
These iPods.

45:16.931 --> 45:20.103
- These are $100 each.
- Okay. Let's go, let's go.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.586
Gracias, amigo.

45:22.413 --> 45:24.689
Rapido, yeah? Please.

45:24.724 --> 45:27.827
Gonna sacrifice mp3 players.

45:27.862 --> 45:29.862
We're on our way.
That's what counts.

45:32.103 --> 45:36.413
- [Sighs] - [Dom] I regret not
working in comodoro slightly

45:36.448 --> 45:40.793
'cause maybe we could have
made it, but we just don't know,

45:40.827 --> 45:43.000
'cause at the time, I
didn't know the situation.

45:43.034 --> 45:45.862
So that was a decision we
made to try and get ahead.

45:45.896 --> 45:47.482
And we were
ahead. It was just...

45:47.517 --> 45:50.758
- [Lizzie] Dom?
- Okay. Someone stopped for Lizzie.

45:50.793 --> 45:53.689
- Dom?
- Argh! Oh!

45:53.724 --> 45:54.941
- [Lizzie chuckles] Oh, no.
- Oh.

45:54.965 --> 45:57.000
- [Dom] Ola.
- [Driver speaking Spanish]

45:59.413 --> 46:00.941
- [Both] Si, si.
- [Driver speaks Spanish]

46:00.965 --> 46:02.551
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:02.586 --> 46:03.907
- [Dom] Let's move.
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god.

46:03.931 --> 46:06.217
You want to get your huggies
out, you can't get in like that.

46:06.241 --> 46:07.424
[Dom] Lizzie,
just get in the car.

46:07.448 --> 46:08.310
- [Lizzie] Okay.
- Okay.

46:08.344 --> 46:09.827
- [Speaks Spanish]
- We need to go...

46:09.862 --> 46:12.758
[Both speaking
Spanish] Muy rapido.

46:12.793 --> 46:15.000
[Lizzie] I can't believe
they can all afford taxis.

46:15.034 --> 46:17.344
They knew, they were
planning it all along.

46:17.379 --> 46:20.931
If we're gonna get anywhere
near the others, we need a miracle.

46:23.413 --> 46:26.137
- [Jen] We're in the taxi.
- [Rob] We've got a decent budget.

46:26.172 --> 46:28.103
[Jen] We've got
the winning driver.

46:28.137 --> 46:33.172
So we just have to hope that
their taxi breaks down or a tire pops.

46:35.172 --> 46:36.689
[Man speaking]

46:37.448 --> 46:38.862
[Jen] What?

46:38.896 --> 46:41.448
I just heard the word,
"we have a problem."

46:41.482 --> 46:44.310
[Rob] I think the car's
running low on water.

46:44.344 --> 46:46.517
Oh, my god, what
are the chances?

46:46.551 --> 46:49.379
I don't know whether
to laugh or cry. Oh.

46:51.034 --> 46:53.310
Right.

46:53.344 --> 46:55.827
[Jen] The boys are gonna
come past any second.

46:55.862 --> 46:58.068
[Emon] First time I've
actually seen snow.

46:58.103 --> 46:59.758
We're getting close
now. Getting close.

47:02.827 --> 47:06.241
[Emon] Once we get to ushuaia,
we're gonna have to dump these bags.

47:06.275 --> 47:10.482
Okay. Oh, come on, little car.

47:10.517 --> 47:14.034
Temperature's good, but I think it
did look like it was leaking a bit. Yeah.

47:14.068 --> 47:15.724
We just gotta get there, man.

47:17.931 --> 47:19.344
We can still do this, Lizzie.

47:19.379 --> 47:21.689
Yeah, we just gotta keep faith.

47:21.724 --> 47:23.586
We stand here at
the petrol station.

47:23.620 --> 47:26.655
- [Dom] Yeah.
- Not ushuaia, but close.

47:26.689 --> 47:28.355
- Gracias, thank you.
- [Dom] Thank you, fabian.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.310
- [Speaks Spanish]
- Mucho gusto.

47:30.344 --> 47:32.965
- [Dom] I'll run in to the petrol station.
- Off you go, run.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.044
- [Dom] Just make sure your thumb's out.
- [Lizzie] Okay.

47:35.068 --> 47:38.241
Dom's in the gas station
asking everyone, pestering.

47:38.275 --> 47:41.655
There's a very good chance
we could do this. Oh! No!

47:43.862 --> 47:47.827
Are... are you going... [In Spanish]
Vamos... [In English] To ushuaia? No?

47:49.172 --> 47:51.241
- Uh...
- Oh!

47:51.689 --> 47:53.000
Run!

47:54.206 --> 47:58.310
Ushuaia? Si.Okay.
Muchos gracias.

47:58.344 --> 48:00.517
Thank you so much.

48:03.241 --> 48:08.655
[Narrator] After 54 days
and 25,000 kilometers,

48:08.689 --> 48:13.689
ushuaia, often referred
to as "El fin del mundo."

48:13.724 --> 48:16.206
- The end of the world.
- Oh, my god, it's here.

48:16.241 --> 48:17.734
- Oh, we're here.
- [Gasps] Oh, my god!

48:17.758 --> 48:21.034
We're in ushuaia. We're
at the end of the world.

48:21.068 --> 48:24.241
Look at that up there. I
bet we have to get up there.

48:24.275 --> 48:27.793
Yeah. We just
need that tiny lead.

48:27.827 --> 48:29.689
I really believe
we can win this.

48:29.724 --> 48:31.241
Right, we've paid the man.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.758
- Oh, god, any car now could be them.
- [Phone ringing]

48:33.793 --> 48:37.551
[Narrator] Jen and Rob receive
directions to the finish line.

48:37.586 --> 48:40.793
"Proceed on foot to Avenue
st maarten and catch..."

48:40.827 --> 48:42.551
[Both] "A bus on b-route..."

48:42.586 --> 48:45.172
To arakur hotel roundabout."

48:45.206 --> 48:47.172
[Narrator] Ten
minutes outside the city,

48:47.206 --> 48:50.137
the arakur hotel
and the finish line.

48:51.655 --> 48:56.137
On its precarious mountain
perch, 250 meters high,

48:56.172 --> 48:58.241
it took seven years to build.

48:58.275 --> 49:03.275
- [Jen] Oh, god! Oh, god!
- [Rob] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

49:06.103 --> 49:08.724
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

49:08.758 --> 49:10.206
Flag someone else down, man.

49:10.241 --> 49:12.931
We'll find shelter,
drop the bags off.

49:13.310 --> 49:14.517
Hola.

49:14.551 --> 49:16.000
Can we leave our bags here?

49:16.034 --> 49:17.413
And come back later?

49:18.758 --> 49:21.034
- Gracias.
- [Jen] Twenty grand.

Come on, Jen.

[Jen] Oh, my god, I'm
gonna die! Where is it?

49:33.931 --> 49:37.482
[Rob] Oh, we're on the
wrong, on the wrong street now.

49:37.517 --> 49:40.655
No, this is not right.
There's the bus stop.

49:40.689 --> 49:43.793
- It says "a" on it.
- [Jen] Yeah, it says a-route, which is not good.

49:46.206 --> 49:49.103
- Come on, Lizzie.
- Just jog, don't sprint.

49:50.172 --> 49:51.448
[Dom] Jog?

49:51.965 --> 49:53.448
Come on.

49:53.482 --> 49:55.551
- In red. Yeah.
- In red?

49:56.482 --> 49:59.137
Don't, go to the left.

49:59.172 --> 50:02.172
- [Rob] I reckon it's the other street over.
- Oh, no.

50:02.206 --> 50:05.103
Argh! Emon! Emon!

50:07.068 --> 50:08.724
[Emon] I think
it's one of these.

50:08.758 --> 50:12.103
- [Rob] You okay there?
- I actually can't do this.

50:12.137 --> 50:16.586
[Dramatic music playing]

50:22.172 --> 50:24.793
[Rob] I think we're
here. Just here.

50:25.931 --> 50:28.000
[Jen laughs]

50:28.034 --> 50:30.241
- Ugh, they're here.
- [Jen] Oh!

50:30.275 --> 50:32.896
[Rob] How the hell
are you here first?

50:32.931 --> 50:34.586
Have you seen
dom and Lizzie, no?

50:34.620 --> 50:37.448
- Where's your bags?
- [Jamiul] Argh.

50:37.482 --> 50:39.068
- No way.
- We don't even...

50:39.103 --> 50:41.551
- [Laughs]
- No way.

50:42.655 --> 50:44.827
There is no way we can win.

50:48.724 --> 50:50.896
They've got no
bags, there's no way.

50:50.931 --> 50:53.206
[Sighs] I'm so disappointed.

50:55.379 --> 50:57.034
- [Emon] Oh, hello.
- [Rob] Jen, Jen.

50:57.068 --> 50:58.241
Okay, I'm coming.

50:58.793 --> 51:01.000
Bus stop! Bus stop!

51:06.586 --> 51:07.655
[Dom] God's sake.

51:11.344 --> 51:14.448
Come on, we can still win it.
We outran the boys last time.

51:14.482 --> 51:16.000
Believe in yourself.
We can do it.

51:16.034 --> 51:18.034
Come on. [Clears throat]

51:19.172 --> 51:20.458
What are we gonna
do about our bags?

51:20.482 --> 51:23.103
[Rob] Drop them at the
roundabout, run the rest of the way.

51:23.655 --> 51:24.862
Ready, Jen?

51:24.896 --> 51:27.310
[Emon] Is that it? Yeah,
I can see it up there.

51:27.344 --> 51:28.482
[Rob] Right, go.

51:28.517 --> 51:30.586
[Emon] Quick, quick, quick.

51:30.620 --> 51:32.482
- [Rob] Come on!
- [Emon] Go, go, go!

51:33.103 --> 51:34.931
Jen, just dump.

51:37.068 --> 51:38.551
[Emon] Come on!

51:38.586 --> 51:42.103
-Oh!
-[Rob] Jen, Jen, keep going! It's a long way.

51:42.137 --> 51:44.182
[Jen] I've left all my
stuff and I still can't do it.

51:44.206 --> 51:46.137
[Rob] Come on, the tortoise
and the hare, come on.

51:46.172 --> 51:50.068
I can't do it! [Sobs]

51:50.103 --> 51:54.206
[Narrator] To reach the hotel,
a two-kilometer winding road.

51:54.241 --> 51:56.827
- [Jamiul] Go, go.
- Or, for the brave...

51:56.862 --> 52:00.137
We can cut ahead to the route.

52:00.172 --> 52:02.068
A more direct route.

52:03.413 --> 52:04.931
I can't see 'em.

52:04.965 --> 52:08.034
That's it, run strong, hon.

52:08.068 --> 52:11.344
[Emon] One second. One
second. I think there's a shortcut.

52:11.379 --> 52:12.827
You must be able to get up.

52:12.862 --> 52:14.655
Climb, use your
hands if you have to.

52:14.689 --> 52:16.655
[Narrator] To claim first place,

52:16.689 --> 52:19.034
both team members
must cross the finish line.

52:19.068 --> 52:20.275
[Emon] They're behind us.

52:20.310 --> 52:23.586
- I can't do this, robby.
- You can, we're a team.

52:23.620 --> 52:26.413
Eat my dust.

52:26.448 --> 52:28.517
Keep moving. Keep
those legs moving.

52:34.137 --> 52:35.344
This is gonna be it, yeah?

52:36.724 --> 52:39.103
- [Man] Hello, how are you?
- [Emon] Very good.

52:39.137 --> 52:41.758
Welcome to ushuaia.
This is for you.

52:44.344 --> 52:46.379
[Jen] Where's the book?

52:46.413 --> 52:48.172
Robby, where's the book?

52:48.206 --> 52:49.206
Okay.

52:50.241 --> 52:53.000
[Jen reading]

52:53.034 --> 52:55.551
[Narrator] One final hurdle.

52:55.586 --> 52:59.724
Weaving through a nature
reserve, several hiking trails.

52:59.758 --> 53:02.068
But only one
leads to the summit.

53:02.103 --> 53:04.551
A kilometer dash from the hotel

53:04.586 --> 53:08.103
where 20,000 pounds
awaits the winners.

53:09.827 --> 53:12.172
- [Jamiul] Elevator.
- [Emon] Right at the top.

53:12.206 --> 53:15.034
[Jen] Where's the elevator?
Where's the elevator?

53:15.068 --> 53:18.137
[Emon] Down, down.
Close, close, close.

53:19.793 --> 53:22.000
Elevators. This is it.
This is it. Come on.

53:22.655 --> 53:24.206
See what it says.

53:24.241 --> 53:29.172
Okay. "Proceed on foot to the finish
line, the summit of cerro alarken."

53:29.206 --> 53:31.758
-[Elevator dings] -All right.
[Speaks foreign language]

53:33.344 --> 53:35.344
- Quick.
- Where you going?

53:35.379 --> 53:37.068
- To the spa.
- No, man.

53:37.103 --> 53:39.143
-[Elevator dings] -Get a
grip on yourself. It's fine.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.758
- Take a left.
- Out here?

53:41.793 --> 53:43.482
- [Rob] Yeah.
- [Emon] Come on, dude.

53:45.517 --> 53:46.896
This makes no sense, man.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.551
No, no, no, no, no, no.

53:49.586 --> 53:51.182
- [Rob] Come on, keep breathing.
- [Jamiul] Where you going?

53:51.206 --> 53:53.655
- It'll be outside.
- [Rob] Don't stop, just keep moving.

53:53.689 --> 53:56.137
- [Jen] I hope they've gone the wrong way.
- Argh!

53:56.172 --> 53:57.758
Go on!

53:57.793 --> 54:00.034
- [Rob] Come on!
- [Screams]

54:00.068 --> 54:01.344
Oh!

54:02.448 --> 54:04.965
- [Jen] This is not it. No?
- This is it. This is it.

54:05.000 --> 54:05.965
- Come on.
- Where's the blue line?

54:06.000 --> 54:07.275
Please believe me.

54:08.310 --> 54:10.103
Come on!

54:10.137 --> 54:12.482
- [Jamiul] Come on.
- [Jen groans]

54:12.517 --> 54:13.827
[Emon] Can't give up!

54:13.862 --> 54:18.034
- [Rob] There it is. Just here.
- [Jen and Rob breathing heavily]

54:21.448 --> 54:22.620
Oh, my god.

54:23.758 --> 54:24.758
Dude, we're here.

54:25.413 --> 54:26.655
- Come on.
- You ready?

54:28.310 --> 54:31.862
Yes, yes, yes.

54:31.896 --> 54:33.517
Have you got my name in there?

54:33.551 --> 54:35.275
[Rob] They literally
just got there.

54:39.379 --> 54:40.620
Well done, boys.

54:41.827 --> 54:42.965
Beat as friends.

54:44.758 --> 54:48.310
Are you okay? There, there.

54:49.758 --> 54:52.793
[Jen sobbing]

54:52.827 --> 54:57.413
Need a hug? [Indistinct]

55:00.137 --> 55:02.379
Look around you. Look at this.

55:02.413 --> 55:04.620
This is what it's all been for.

55:04.655 --> 55:09.137
12,460 racing hours.
All in 30 seconds.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.275
We did start this as strangers.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.896
You know what? I think we've
made up for ten years' time.

55:17.551 --> 55:20.137
You all right, Jen?
You did so well.

55:21.655 --> 55:23.896
- You know I love you, man.
- Thank, man.

55:23.931 --> 55:25.758
- Thank, man.
- You know I love you.

55:25.793 --> 55:27.310
[Both cheer]

55:27.344 --> 55:30.172
[Jen] Obviously, like, so thrilled
to have made it till the end.

55:30.206 --> 55:32.620
Yes, the money would have
changed our lives and been great.

55:32.655 --> 55:36.517
But the real winners
always do it together.

55:36.551 --> 55:38.931
- [Rob] We feel stronger for it, don't we?
- Absolutely.

55:38.965 --> 55:42.931
I never really, before this
race, put my trust in strangers,

55:42.965 --> 55:47.241
but when it got to, like, no
money and desperation status,

55:47.275 --> 55:51.034
that's when I really had to start
putting myself out there trusting people.

55:51.068 --> 55:54.448
- Mm, I love you.
- Me, too.

55:54.482 --> 55:57.724
And I'm so proud that I've done
things I'd never have at home

55:57.758 --> 55:59.344
and had a really
good time doing them.

55:59.379 --> 56:01.206
Without you, I
couldn't have done that.

56:02.206 --> 56:03.793
- [Jamiul] Whoo!
- Whoo!

56:03.827 --> 56:05.172
I've changed as a person.

56:05.206 --> 56:08.379
I made a big mistake ten
years ago by leaving the family.

56:08.413 --> 56:11.310
This trip has taught me
how important family is.

56:11.344 --> 56:13.724
We're fortunate to have
friends and family around us.

56:13.758 --> 56:15.517
But a lot of the kids
in the world aren't.

56:16.827 --> 56:20.000
- What we witnessed in Sao Paulo.
- Kids starving.

56:20.034 --> 56:23.413
So we'll donate 10,000 pounds
to south American charities

56:23.448 --> 56:26.275
to help kids on the streets,
especially in Sao paolo.

56:28.379 --> 56:30.448
Shouldn't be like this, man.

56:30.482 --> 56:32.758
There's a lot of people
that it could potentially help.

56:32.793 --> 56:35.724
- I'll feel like a bigger winner if we did that.
- Yeah.

56:35.758 --> 56:37.206
And that's our plan.

56:41.793 --> 56:43.068
[Lizzie] There's the book.

56:46.655 --> 56:48.034
-Ah -oh, my god.

56:48.068 --> 56:50.068
- Oh, my god!
- Twenty seconds.

56:50.103 --> 56:53.551
That was only two hours
ago. But you know what?

56:53.586 --> 56:56.034
We might not have won, but look.

56:58.137 --> 56:59.448
When you think back to Peru,

56:59.482 --> 57:00.941
doesn't seem like
you can close that gap.

57:00.965 --> 57:03.862
31 hours and we
finished two hours behind.

57:03.896 --> 57:06.448
It does make you think.
What if we had one more leg?

57:06.482 --> 57:09.275
[Lizzie] We've lived in the
unknown for eight weeks.

57:09.310 --> 57:11.068
- And I enjoyed it.
- Yeah.

57:11.103 --> 57:12.275
- Well done.
- Hug.

57:12.310 --> 57:14.379
[Dom] We were both a
bit lost going into this race,

57:14.413 --> 57:16.827
- and we've sort of found ourselves a bit.
- Yeah.

57:16.862 --> 57:20.251
[Lizzie] When we started this, we set out
with the ambition of becoming better friends,

57:20.275 --> 57:23.482
and there's nothing that can make
you do that more than eight weeks,

57:23.517 --> 57:27.551
24/7, sharing the same
room, the same bus seats.

57:27.586 --> 57:29.448
That amount of time,
we're gonna get closer.

57:29.482 --> 57:30.827
- [Dom] Yeah.
- [Rob] You made it.

57:30.862 --> 57:33.172
Congratulations on making
it with the backpacks.

57:33.206 --> 57:34.896
- Well done, guys.
- Hello, buddy.

57:34.931 --> 57:36.965
- We still bicker all the time.
- Yeah.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.241
But, like, we've learned
to deal with each other

57:39.275 --> 57:41.000
in a way that we
never had before.

57:41.034 --> 57:42.827
I mean, we've lost
two groups on the way.

57:42.862 --> 57:45.034
- I know, yeah.
- I'm sure at some point in this race,

57:45.068 --> 57:46.527
we've all felt we wouldn't
make it till the end.

57:46.551 --> 57:48.034
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

57:48.068 --> 57:51.034
- Yeah, we've decided not to get divorced.
- [All cheer]

57:51.068 --> 57:53.172
What is it in Spanish?
El fin del mundo.

57:53.206 --> 57:54.275
- End of the world.
- Yes.

57:54.310 --> 57:55.689
- Fin del munde.
- Fin del munde.

57:55.724 --> 57:57.355
- It's cool, isn't it?
- [Lizzie] It's beautiful.

57:57.379 --> 58:01.724
[Calm music playing]

58:01.758 --> 58:04.793
From our struggle
and here we are.

58:05.758 --> 58:09.517
Mexico City feels like ages ago.

58:10.241 --> 58:14.344
From deserts to rain forests.

58:14.379 --> 58:16.827
- Snow-capped mountains.
- Yes, we did that.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.068
[Emon] From top to bottom.

58:20.103 --> 58:21.586
I've got some fish!

58:23.724 --> 58:25.206
And everything else in between.

58:25.241 --> 58:26.344
Yeah, man.

58:31.551 --> 58:33.103
And everybody else in between.

58:33.137 --> 58:35.241
Welcome to this family.

58:35.862 --> 58:37.137
It's for all you guys.

58:38.793 --> 58:40.068
That.

58:40.793 --> 58:42.000
Cheers.

58:44.586 --> 58:48.000
