WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:05.838
Adam, eyes here.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.676
Follow my finger.

00:09.802 --> 00:15.348
Adam, show me a bicycle.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.480
Eyes here.

00:27.403 --> 00:32.115
Adam, show me a bicycle.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.716
No, buddy, that's a ball.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.095
Adam, look at me.
Are you hungry?

00:54.221 --> 00:55.847
Show me what you
want for lunch.

01:13.991 --> 01:18.035
He's still drawing those lines
instead of looking at the cards.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.707
More juice?

01:23.250 --> 01:26.294
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.922
Adam, buddy, eyes here.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.132
He's tired, Dom.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.051
He wouldn't be
if we stuck to the schedule.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.262
Show me the juice, buddy.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.348
I think we've reached
the point of diminishing returns.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.768
He has to ask for it. Adam.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.104
He's choking.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.775
That's impossible.
It's mac and cheese.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.359
Ten-year-old boy who screams
for his life for no reason.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.278
He's autistic.
Severely autistic.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.198
Can't talk,
can't make eye contact.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.408
Screaming is probably his way
of communicating.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.411
And he went to three different doctors
who all said just that.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.831
So, clearly that can't be the answer.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.624
His brain can't
filter information.

02:46.750 --> 02:50.044
It's a constant assault on his senses.
I'd scream, too.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.506
Or it's something medical-sounding,
like dysesthesia.

02:53.632 --> 02:57.927
Parents are convinced that there's
something wrong with their son.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.974
Since when did we start believing
parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?

03:03.100 --> 03:04.559
Elevator.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.229
Dad was on Wall Street,
Mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.481
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.276
So they're over-protective and scared.
The more reason to discount...

03:13.402 --> 03:14.610
They study this kid.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.030
Heard him scream a million times,
but in ten years of caring for him,

03:18.156 --> 03:19.657
this is the first time
they've brought him to a hospital.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.285
ER checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.703
Which means the only symptom
was a scream,

03:23.829 --> 03:25.413
which is diagnostic of nothing.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.541
Kid clutched his chest, BP was elevated,
maybe there was chest pain.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.376
ER said the heart was fine.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.128
Don't be so quick
to dismiss pain.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.547
- Where are we going?
- Down.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.424
Stool sample
to check for parasites,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.427
blood culture to rule out infection,
and ANA for lupus.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.761
Because he screamed?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.805
Could also be
an environmental reaction.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.558
An allergy.
Dust, wheat, pollen,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.602
- a toxin or something he ate.
- Check the house.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.478
And run a lung
ventilation scan.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.063
Lungs are in the chest, too, right?

03:51.189 --> 03:52.440
I had a date last night,
she screamed.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.483
Should we spend
a hundred thousand dollars testing her?

03:54.610 --> 03:57.278
Of course not.
This isn't a veterinary hospital.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.197
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving...

04:00.324 --> 04:01.490
That's not what I'm saying.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.200
That's too bad.
It was a good point.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.161
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.203
You know what it's going to be like

04:06.330 --> 04:08.831
trying to put an autistic kid
into a nuclear scanner?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.333
I don't envy you guys.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.839
I want my old carpet back.

04:17.424 --> 04:22.762
We're going to have to do this later.
A kid in the clinic had an accident.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.222
Generally, when people
are on the phone...

04:25.349 --> 04:27.266
I want my old carpet back.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.559
It was stained with blood.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.312
Yeah, my blood,
which makes the carpet part of me.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.606
I want it back.
I want to be buried with it.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.608
You think you can get me to do
anything you want,

04:35.734 --> 04:37.610
regardless of
how stupid it is?

04:37.736 --> 04:39.779
It's my office.
It's where I work,

04:39.905 --> 04:44.075
where I think, where I save lives,
allowing you to brag to rich people,

04:44.201 --> 04:47.495
so they'll give you more money
to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.538
I want it back the way it was.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.041
It's identical
to the old carpet.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.543
Except without
the hazardous biological waste.

04:54.670 --> 04:59.006
I shall not return to my office until
every patented, durable micro-fiber

04:59.132 --> 05:00.716
has been restored
to its rightful place.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.301
Inspiring.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.346
If you don't want to work
in your office, work in the clinic.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.766
If you don't want to work in the clinic,
go home. And don't get paid.

05:08.892 --> 05:14.563
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica! Attica!

05:17.526 --> 05:18.651
Attica?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.949
He just needs to
finish this level.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.451
We only have the scanner
for the next half hour.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.995
- After that...
- Trust me,

05:29.121 --> 05:31.539
you don't want to move him
until he's finished.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.584
The sooner we do this test,
the sooner we can get you guys home.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.343
Adam, do you think that...

05:45.387 --> 05:46.554
No.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.474
Ten minutes. Tops.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.185
If he has a vascular disorder,
he might not have...

05:53.311 --> 05:55.604
He might not have ten minutes?

05:56.148 --> 05:58.149
I don't have ten minutes.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.528
No! No! You don't want to
do that. Adam? Adam?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.952
I used Metamucil
like the doctor told me

06:10.078 --> 06:12.747
and finally I was able to
use the bathroom.

06:13.373 --> 06:18.377
But I saw something in the toilet
I couldn't identify.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.381
I wrapped it in tissue paper,
so you could take a look.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.263
Can't you sedate him or something?

06:29.389 --> 06:33.267
I could if I didn't want
the test results to mean anything.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.034
Painkillers, exercising,

06:50.160 --> 06:53.537
we even did that
puncture thing, nothing works.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.708
Then this morning, I get up,
my back feels great.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.504
I figured I'd better
get down here, right away.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.766
Big shocker, Dad's depressed.

07:13.892 --> 07:14.934
Save your time.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.353
SSRIs don't cause chest pain.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.190
Wow.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.067
Every minute of every day is booked.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.861
When he eats, sleeps,
plays his handheld.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.905
Not much of a life for them.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.281
They chose to have a family.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.785
You don't get to decide
what your kid's going to be like.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.620
Nobody chooses this.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.628
It's funny,
you get a normal kid, the parent works.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.672
You get a special kid
that costs more,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.633
you quit and turn the backyard
into a therapy circuit.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.052
Yes, if only you
were handicapped.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.556
All the good times
you could have had with Dad.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.780
Hi, Doctor House.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.200
Hello, girl whose name
I don't remember,

08:13.326 --> 08:16.120
but whose dad I treated,
so I don't really know why she's here.

08:16.246 --> 08:21.500
Ali. I think I caught
what my dad has. The rhino thing.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.294
Right.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.922
Does that hurt?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.174
Little.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.135
It's in my chest, too.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.386
Of course it is.

08:41.646 --> 08:46.066
Kind of had access through the shirt,
but this'll work.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.572
That feels good.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.411
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

08:58.246 --> 09:02.124
About five weeks ago.
It's been very lonely.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.173
The...

09:11.885 --> 09:15.179
The ventilation scan was normal.
Time to send him home.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.848
Can't leave right now.
Well, congratulations.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.392
You are the proud owner
of your very own "rhino thing."

09:20.518 --> 09:23.354
A rhinovirus?
You can't leave because she has a cold?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.357
I can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.278
All the tests are normal.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.823
Okay, don't start with me.
We're backed up.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.035
I know this is hard for all of us,
but thanks to Doctor Cuddy,

09:38.161 --> 09:40.037
I don't have an office,
so I have to work here.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.580
What did she do
to your office?

09:41.706 --> 09:43.040
It's unusable.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.793
So whatever's bothering him,
it wasn't his lungs.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.002
What about the kid's house?

09:47.128 --> 09:49.922
There were some pesticides and alcohol,
but the tox screen was negative.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.299
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong with this kid.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.135
We already had that discussion.
We get a fecal smear?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.887
Should we do this
someplace else?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.014
No, Cuddy says
I have to work here.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.060
No, I said you can work in your office,
or you had to work here.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688
And since I can't work
in my office...

10:05.814 --> 10:07.690
Is this your master plan?

10:07.816 --> 10:11.610
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.655
Devious. Saw it
in a James Bond movie.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.532
Fecal smear! Talk to me.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.033
Get out of here.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.159
Put back my carpet?

10:19.286 --> 10:20.619
No. Get out of here.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.163
Fecal matter.
Is there a sample we can look at?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.874
The parents have a smear kit.
The kid is constipated.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.836
Do what you want.
Not replacing your carpet.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.257
Go up his rear
and get a smear.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.427
Which reminds me,
I kind of feel like a bagel.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.639
Carpets.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.477
Need a stool sample.

10:46.896 --> 10:51.108
We should probably wait until
he's finished playing that level, huh?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.485
I actually think
he's a bit better today.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.195
He seems more like
his old self.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.156
It's possible that
he was never sick.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.575
I guess, we could've overreacted.

11:06.041 --> 11:10.419
- Adam? Adam?
- Adam? Adam?

11:15.592 --> 11:19.136
So what makes fluid fill the lining
of a kid's lungs?

11:19.262 --> 11:22.139
Why are we in here?
Is this some sort of power play?

11:22.265 --> 11:23.098
Yeah.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.186
So, you stuck your finger in the kid
and gave him a pleural effusion?

11:27.312 --> 11:29.271
Have you ever considered
getting a manicure?

11:29.397 --> 11:31.440
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.192
Or do you really have a problem
with the carpeting?

11:33.318 --> 11:34.693
Change sets you off...

11:34.819 --> 11:36.320
I said it was a power play.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.239
If someone answers yes to option A,
you don't move on to option B.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.909
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out heart failure.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.203
Why now? Why a power play now?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.788
I smelled weakness.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.998
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.050
That's funny.
It says, "James Wilson."

11:59.052 --> 12:00.469
That's a strange typo.

12:00.637 --> 12:05.224
The fluid comes back and exudates,
get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.603
- Thank you for coming.
- No problem.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.147
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

12:12.273 --> 12:18.695
You share stories, feelings,
toys, you don't share offices.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.156
That is so not Zen.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.784
It was a gift.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.619
Some doctors get those.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.246
So, you want mornings
or afternoons?

12:27.372 --> 12:30.958
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable,
so you're going to make me miserable,

12:31.084 --> 12:33.085
so I can make Cuddy miserable
on your behalf?

12:33.211 --> 12:34.044
Yeah.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.004
What makes you think
I can make her miserable?

12:36.131 --> 12:37.214
'Cause you're
good at that stuff.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.299
I'm nothing compared to you.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.592
Is there anything
you'll throw out?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.928
That's a gift from
an eleven-year-old patient of mine.

12:43.054 --> 12:46.265
She and I both knew it was a piece
of junk, and that's what made her laugh.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.851
So you gotta keep it until she...

12:48.977 --> 12:50.477
She already did.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.449
Adam, I need you to
stay still, buddy.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.993
It's okay. It's okay.
I got him.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.455
There we go.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.966
What? What is it?
Is his heart okay?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.385
No.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.227
Echo suggested a conduction
abnormality, EKG confirmed it.

13:32.353 --> 13:36.607
Still doesn't explain the effusion.
The pleural fluid was an exudate.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.610
We should be looking for something that
explains the heart and lung problems.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.945
An infection, parasite, cancer.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.450
Microbiology showed no organisms
in the fluids, so forget infection.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.702
It's not a power play.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.624
Doing a differential in the clinic
makes sense, piss Cuddy off.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.001
Same thing with Wilson's office,
works indirectly.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.587
But now we're in office space

13:58.713 --> 14:01.381
because you don't want to be
in your own office.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.884
Which means this has nothing
to do with Cuddy.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.220
You really are obsessed
with your carpets.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.056
- Which means...
- What are you doing here?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.350
I have this room
booked from two to three.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.644
Two, East Coast Time?

14:15.647 --> 14:20.067
I thought you meant Pacific.
Which is stupid of me, I guess.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
What about parasites?

14:23.488 --> 14:25.030
Stool sample's negative.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.114
It's two o'clock.

14:26.241 --> 14:30.285
Oh, well. We should go then.
That just leaves cancer.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.162
Get a lung biopsy.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.040
It took a half an hour to get the mask
on the kid for the lung scan.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.293
I'm sorry. Was there somewhere
you needed to be?

14:42.173 --> 14:44.675
House, can we talk?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.390
- Carpet?
- Never.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.808
Nothing to talk about.

14:52.934 --> 14:57.020
Your girlfriend called the clinic
15 times, looking for you today.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.689
Lot to discuss,
china patterns...

14:58.815 --> 15:00.357
House. She's a stalker.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.483
Right.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.902
Couldn't be that she finds me
interesting, attractive,

15:04.028 --> 15:05.112
has to be that she's insane.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.198
She's called you 15 times. Your mother's
not that interested in you.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.325
Well maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.494
- I'm notifying security.
- Is this about the carpet?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.329
Do you think I'll back off
if you block all my fun?

15:14.455 --> 15:15.747
You better not be having fun.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.583
I'm having fun.
I'm not having sex.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.418
- She's dangerous.
- She's not dangerous.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.919
- She's pretty.
- She's pretty.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.171
- Men are stupid.
- I'm with you so far.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.382
I'm notifying security.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.429
Give her a break.
She's not dangerous, she's insightful.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.682
You can't stop our love!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.648
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.650
We have a ten-year-old
with pleural effusion

15:43.776 --> 15:46.028
and conduction abnormality,
but no heart failure.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.529
Was there protein
in the pleural fluid?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.615
Yeah. That's why
we're thinking cancer.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.784
Non-Hodgkin's probably.
So we want to do a lung biopsy.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.536
Lung biopsies usually
come back negative,

15:54.662 --> 15:56.747
so biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.124
That's probably something
an oncologist should do, right?

15:59.250 --> 16:01.376
There's nothing real tricky to it.
It's a biopsy.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.546
Still, just to be safe. You mind?

16:12.430 --> 16:16.767
For the love of God,
can't somebody shut that kid up?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.477
People are trying to
work around here.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.270
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.480
Who are you?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.190
Somebody you'll
never send a gift to.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.984
This is Doctor House,
your son's doctor.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.694
High test, please.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.031
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:34.285 --> 16:35.369
Out of Vicodin?

16:36.579 --> 16:38.288
What are you doing?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.208
Eating the red berries.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.194
He trusted you.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.990
No, that wasn't trust.
That was self-preservation.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.201
No. That was huge.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.955
- It was like a conversation.
- A mon...

17:20.623 --> 17:25.627
A monkey's afraid to eat the red berries
until he sees another monkey eat 'em.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.422
Monkey see, monkey do.
That's all it was.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.260
Your kid's still just as messed up
as when we admitted him.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.191
That was sensitive.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.860
You have pretty hair.

17:51.446 --> 17:54.197
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.284
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.953
What they should do is
get a cocker spaniel.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.456
A dog would look them
in the eye,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.959
wag his tail when he's happy,
lick their face, show them love.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.170
Is it so wrong for them
to want to have a normal child?

18:08.296 --> 18:10.338
It's normal to
want to be normal.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.507
Spoken like
a true Circle Queen.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.845
See, skinny,
socially-privileged white people

18:16.971 --> 18:18.847
get to draw this
neat little circle.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.850
Everyone inside
the circle is normal.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.269
Everyone outside the circle
should be beaten,

18:24.395 --> 18:27.939
broken and reset,
so they can be brought into the circle.

18:28.065 --> 18:32.194
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized, or worse, pitied.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.321
So, it's wrong to feel sorry
for this little boy?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.655
Why would you feel sorry
for someone

18:35.782 --> 18:38.408
who gets to opt out
of the inane courteous formalities,

18:38.534 --> 18:42.120
which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore, degrading?

18:42.246 --> 18:45.123
This kid doesn't have to pretend
to be interested in your back pain,

18:45.249 --> 18:48.418
or your excretions,
or your grandma's itchy place.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.170
Can you imagine
how liberating it would be

18:50.296 --> 18:54.090
to live a life free of
all the mind-numbing social niceties?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.720
I don't pity this kid.
I envy him.

19:00.223 --> 19:05.060
No cancer because
these aren't lymph cells.

19:05.770 --> 19:06.978
Then what are they?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.397
Liver cells.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.951
Wow, liver cells
under his arm.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.122
Wonder what he's got
where his liver's supposed to be?

19:40.638 --> 19:44.140
Anyone got a clue how
liver cells got into the kid's armpit?

19:48.729 --> 19:50.063
Make yourself at home.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.901
So, you think maybe
Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.612
Lymph system circulates fluid,
not organ cells.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.031
Cancer cells break into
the lymphatic system all the time.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.491
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.119
So what's the difference
between cancer cells and liver cells?

20:04.245 --> 20:06.371
Why can one pass through walls,
but the other can't?

20:06.497 --> 20:08.415
Cancer cells are damaged,
it lets them grow into blood vessels,

20:08.541 --> 20:09.624
go wherever they want.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.126
So if the liver cells
are damaged...

20:11.252 --> 20:13.211
The liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.797
So if the liver cells
are damaged,

20:15.923 --> 20:18.508
it's theoretically possible
they passed into the lymphatic system.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.720
Liver failure could also explain
pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.096
The liver cells are fine.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.473
He was immunized for Hep A and B,
and do you really think this kid

20:25.600 --> 20:28.351
is having unprotected sex,
or sharing needles?

20:29.353 --> 20:32.272
Daddy does seem
the type to use a rubber.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.860
So it's not viral. That just leaves
a lot of booze-irrhosis.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.906
Our 10-year-old boy does not
have a drinking problem, or cirrhosis.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.157
House, when we
echoed his heart,

20:42.283 --> 20:43.950
we got a piece of his liver.
There was no scarring.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.661
Cirrhosis explains the symptoms,
heart problems, lungs...

20:46.787 --> 20:49.122
Look up cirrhosis in the dictionary,
it means scarring.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.583
Parents aren't doing
or dosing this kid.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.959
How would you know that?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.211
The kid can't talk.
Why do you think I took this case?

20:55.338 --> 20:56.838
He's not going to give away
the ending.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.256
They quit their jobs for him.

20:58.382 --> 21:02.010
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

21:02.136 --> 21:05.096
Unfortunately,
their kid is nothing you'd want.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.891
When a baby is born, it's perfect.

21:08.017 --> 21:12.270
Little fingers, little toes,
plump, perfect, pink,

21:12.396 --> 21:14.940
and brimming
with unbridled potential.

21:15.316 --> 21:19.152
Then it's downhill.
Some hills steeper than others.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.655
Parents get off
on their kids' accomplishments.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.448
Bend over and relax.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.950
Cute.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.703
They'll annoy you
with trophy rooms and report cards.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.789
Hell, they'll even show you a purple cow

21:30.915 --> 21:34.334
and tell what a keen eye
for color their kid has.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.969
But this kid,
he doesn't smile,

21:44.095 --> 21:45.929
he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.389
His parents get nothing

21:47.515 --> 21:50.350
but the right to brag that their kid
picked orange juice out of a lineup.

21:50.476 --> 21:54.229
So you figure they slip the kid a mickey
so they don't have to deal.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.314
Do a biopsy
to confirm cirrhosis.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.652
Don't try to pawn it off on Wilson,
he's going to be busy with Cuddy.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.202
My parents love me unconditionally.
Get out of here.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.083
Don't you think
the restraining order's a little much?

22:15.209 --> 22:17.877
He's not actually going to have sex
with a 17-year-old patient.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.504
I didn't think he was going to ask me

22:19.630 --> 22:22.090
to dig a bloodstained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.801
It might be easier
in the long run.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.140
Are we stopping here,
so House doesn't find us?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.435
Unless you want to make out.

22:34.729 --> 22:36.604
You want me to surrender
to House's coup?

22:36.731 --> 22:42.277
No, no. You pro-actively
give him what he wants.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.446
I defeat him
by surrendering to him.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.615
He'll never see it coming.
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.743
What is it, a thousand bucks
to carpet a room?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.536
Actually, it's 400.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.204
Not doing it.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.171
Liver biopsy?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.380
They're doing it now.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.757
How's it going?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.091
Like a biopsy.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.510
Needles, cells, screaming.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.471
What did you find
in the stool sample?

23:09.597 --> 23:11.848
You were too busy
bothering Cuddy.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.850
But as discussed,
it was negative for parasites.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.143
Can we get out of here?

23:15.269 --> 23:16.394
I didn't ask
what you didn't find,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.605
I asked what you did find
in the stool sample.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.607
Stool

23:20.775 --> 23:24.194
and traces of iron, zinc,
calcium carbonate. Can we leave?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.488
What's the matter?
You afraid of the man?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.531
Yeah.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.618
Too late.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.121
Leave my stuff alone.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.750
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim
in 15 minutes. You're wearing that?

23:38.876 --> 23:42.128
I'm going to count to three
and then I'm going to fire you. One.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.215
Calcium carbonate?
That's an anti-diarrheal, right?

23:45.341 --> 23:46.841
- Two.
- Think that's significant?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.302
Think hard poops is significant?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.138
Two and a half.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.141
Never threaten
unless you're ready to deliver.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.518
Makes you look weak.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.353
Thank God you don't have children.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.316
Doctor Cuddy.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.778
Take a message.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.407
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

24:11.992 --> 24:16.412
Wow. That's like the one thing
that would get me out of here.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.832
I'm sorry,
you can't come in here.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.959
What's going on?

24:21.085 --> 24:23.044
One, two, three.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.631
He's in V fib.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.761
Charged.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.263
Clear.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.931
Charging, clear.

24:35.224 --> 24:39.519
Charging, clear.
Charging, clear.

24:51.407 --> 24:55.326
He's stable for the moment.
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.745
Okay, what else do we know?

24:57.872 --> 25:00.748
His liver's damaged. Pleural effusion
compromised his lung function.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.209
Biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.211
Parents didn't
poison their son.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.549
It's not his liver,
his heart, or his lungs.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.343
It's the calcium carbonate
in his stool.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.138
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably just overdid it.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.390
Or they didn't do it at all.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.601
Calcium carbonate
is also what's in chalk.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.852
So he ate some chalk.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.479
It isn't toxic, it sure didn't cause
the pleural effusion.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.606
Forget the chalk.

25:24.732 --> 25:25.773
You just said
it was about the chalk.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.734
Yes, and then I said,
"Forget the chalk."

25:27.860 --> 25:30.862
You must be very confused.
The kid's got pica.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
You take him to a buffet,
he's going to eat the table.

25:33.741 --> 25:34.657
Or lead paint.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.202
Level of lead in the blood was normal.
His tox screen was clean.

25:37.328 --> 25:38.703
We're not looking for typical poisons.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.705
We're looking for anything
that he could put in his mouth.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.832
Matches, spiders, bricks.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.376
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.711
Even better.

25:46.837 --> 25:51.549
Hansel, get samples of
the Gingerbread House. Bag everything.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.017
Hey.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.191
You could get into
a lot of trouble being here.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.901
I wanted to see you.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.194
Yeah, I got that.

26:12.363 --> 26:16.282
So did everyone else.
They think you're a stalker.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.619
One could argue those people
might be jealous of your attention.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.121
Yes, I actually
made that argument.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.000
- You going home?
- That's the plan.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.630
In Iceland, the age of consent is 14.

26:31.507 --> 26:35.176
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry up there.

26:35.719 --> 26:39.055
Today I'm jailbait,
but in 22 weeks,

26:39.390 --> 26:42.308
anybody can do anything to me.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.437
Will I be so different
in 22 weeks?

26:47.106 --> 26:49.941
Twenty-two weeks is enough
for an embryo to grow arms and legs.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.151
It's just a line.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.697
An arbitrary line drawn
by a bunch of sad, old men in robes.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.574
Yeah, who cares what judges think?

27:00.035 --> 27:02.078
I didn't think of you as a guy
who followed rules

27:02.204 --> 27:04.622
just because they were rules.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.005
You are over ten years younger than me.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.258
I said, "Over."

27:18.554 --> 27:20.430
- Gotta go!
- House.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.016
Doctor Cuddy.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.685
Do you happen to know the way
to the Icelandic consulate?

27:25.811 --> 27:29.605
This young woman, a stranger to me,
was just asking directions.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.942
Security was going to call the police.
I don't want to do that to you.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.902
- Go home.
- She needed a ride.

27:35.029 --> 27:38.197
She got here on her own,
she can get home on her own.

27:38.741 --> 27:39.574
Now.

27:41.702 --> 27:45.079
If I see you on hospital grounds again,
I will call the police.

27:59.136 --> 28:03.598
After that look, I'm feeling
a little frisky. Looks like you're up.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.725
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.062
The frisky, it went away.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.147
House, this isn't a game.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.405
If I leave her alone,
can I have my carpet back?

28:19.615 --> 28:20.948
No.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.243
If I forget about
my carpet can I have her?

28:50.104 --> 28:53.856
Jimsonweed. I found a small patch of it
in his backyard.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.568
Jimsonweed contains atropine,
poor man's acid.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.030
Our kid's been tripping on
"Lucy in the Sky with cubic zirconium."

29:01.156 --> 29:03.491
Explains the pleural effusion,
the heart arrhythmias.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.410
Meeting here will do nothing
to upset Cuddy.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.869
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.330
I'm trying to figure out
what's wrong with the patient.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.957
- Continue.
- I'm done.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.501
Jimsonweed doesn't explain
the screaming.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.086
You've obviously
never had a bad trip.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.672
I would've thought you'd try
to accomplish two goals at once.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.049
Why can't you be more like
the other age-inappropriate girls

29:20.175 --> 29:23.010
who have a thing for me?
Just accept me for me.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.304
Continue.

29:25.431 --> 29:29.016
Treatment for jimsonweed OD
is physostigmine.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.102
Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.645
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.731
Serum from the lab in Patterson
is three days minimum.

29:35.858 --> 29:38.151
He won't survive three days.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.610
What time does he wake up?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.446
7:35 a.m.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.322
Then what? Walk me through it.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.325
7:40 to 7:50 he goes to the toilet,
washes his face.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.410
What does this matter?

29:47.536 --> 29:48.703
I'm trying to prove
he ate the plant.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.705
His schedule has nothing to do
with jimsonweed.

29:50.831 --> 29:51.914
There are two possibilities.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.793
Either the parents saw him eat the plant
or the kid has unsupervised time,

29:55.919 --> 29:58.004
and eats plants instead of
playing with blocks.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.548
Even if you find 15 minutes
of free time outside,

30:00.674 --> 30:02.133
it doesn't mean he spent it
eating a bush.

30:02.259 --> 30:06.471
So, what do we do? Nothing?
Wait for the kid to tell us? What?

30:10.934 --> 30:12.477
Where are you going?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.228
To talk to him.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.782
Ever see your son eat a bush?

30:26.909 --> 30:27.825
I haven't.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.202
I've only ever seen him eat...

30:29.328 --> 30:31.579
Adam, you ate something at your house.

30:31.705 --> 30:35.875
Something that made you sick.
I need you to show me what you ate.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.335
He can't answer you.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.170
Neither can you.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.673
This is your backyard.

30:43.634 --> 30:47.053
You may know it as Mel's Diner.
This is your sandbox.

30:47.179 --> 30:51.432
Your jungle gym.
And under it is this.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.646
I need to know if you ate this, Adam.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.190
He doesn't know what you want.

30:59.316 --> 31:03.319
Adam, you have to tell me
because if you don't,

31:06.573 --> 31:09.033
game over. You'll be dead.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.327
What the hell are you doing?

31:11.453 --> 31:13.204
Show me what you ate.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.582
Adam, show me what you ate.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.313
- Adam?
- Honey?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.107
Adam!

31:51.952 --> 31:54.245
Come on in, brothers and sister,

31:54.371 --> 31:56.372
welcome to
the house of the Lord!

31:56.498 --> 31:58.583
House, come on. The Chapel?

31:58.709 --> 32:02.712
We have been blessed
with the miracle of a new symptom.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.463
Brother, can you testify

32:04.590 --> 32:08.759
as to why this poor child's
eyeball rolled back into his head?

32:09.303 --> 32:13.347
It's consistent with jimsonweed
poisoning, ocular paralysis. I'm sorry.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.807
The wicked shall deceive ye

32:14.933 --> 32:18.185
because they have turned
from the Lord and are idiots.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.646
His ocular muscle
didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.399
- MS?
- It is easier for a wise man

32:23.525 --> 32:25.818
- to gain access to heaven...
- Will you stop doing that?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.111
Just say, "Not MS."

32:27.237 --> 32:29.238
A stroke, bleed in the brain.

32:29.364 --> 32:33.451
We'd be seeing other symptoms besides
a single eye misalignment. Like a coma.

32:33.577 --> 32:34.869
And you've already testified.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.329
It's a tumor.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.456
And all the imaging just missed it?

32:38.582 --> 32:39.999
It's a micro-tumor.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.209
It started in his lung,
which caused the pleural effusion.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.379
Then it metastasized to his liver,
which made it slough cells.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.132
And then it went to his brain
behind the eye,

32:48.258 --> 32:49.800
which caused it to roll back
into his head.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.720
So, he had three tumors
and we missed all of them?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.639
What's the opposite of a miracle?

32:54.765 --> 32:58.517
I have a better chance of finding it,
now that I know exactly where to look.

32:58.644 --> 33:02.396
So, unless you have a better idea,

33:02.522 --> 33:08.027
I'm going to go CT his head and then,
if I have to, remove his eye.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.115
You remove this kid's eye,

33:13.241 --> 33:17.620
he's only going to be
half as good at not making eye contact.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.340
Hello?

33:31.009 --> 33:35.179
Hello?

33:37.474 --> 33:40.184
I have sad news for you.
She doesn't love you.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.561
You're ugly when you're jealous.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.439
She showed up at my house last night.
Came on to me.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.234
She's even more perfect than I thought.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.070
House, she's sick.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.698
You say, "Sick,"
I say, "Freestylin'."

33:53.824 --> 33:56.075
The girl will have sex
with an invertebrate.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.077
Come on, you're not that bad.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.329
She has a problem.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.373
You're not doing her
any favors by indulging her.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.208
How could you lie like this?

34:04.334 --> 34:06.252
Do you not have room
in your heart for love?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.503
You don't believe me.

34:07.629 --> 34:10.339
I didn't believe the kids when they said
that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.632
I didn't believe them then.
I don't believe them now.

34:11.758 --> 34:15.136
I don't care that
Susie married Johnny. She's mine.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.181
She has a mole on her right breast,
just below the nipple.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.349
No, she doesn't.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.600
You've seen her breasts?

34:21.727 --> 34:24.145
It was a medical exam.
I was listening to her heart.

34:24.271 --> 34:28.315
It went, "Greg-House.
Greg-House. Greg-House."

34:29.109 --> 34:30.901
Fine. I'm lying.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.989
But she did come back.
She's locked up in my office.

34:35.323 --> 34:39.493
I was hoping you could talk to her,
put an end to this.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.468
Listen to me.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.929
Do you have any idea what you'd have

34:59.055 --> 35:01.599
to look forward to
if you stayed with me?

35:01.725 --> 35:04.685
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.856
You're only saying that to make me go.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.358
I'm saying it
'cause it's true.

35:13.904 --> 35:17.114
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.327
Is there a Victor
in your class?

35:24.706 --> 35:28.542
If you're not with someone your age,
you'll regret it.

35:29.586 --> 35:34.256
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.343
What about us?

35:37.928 --> 35:39.678
We'll always have Fresno.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.643
I'm no good at being noble,
but it doesn't take much to see

35:45.769 --> 35:47.144
that the problems
of two little people

35:47.270 --> 35:50.022
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.943
Someday you'll understand that.

35:57.364 --> 36:01.325
Now, now,
here's looking at you.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.666
Damn.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.087
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.171
What?

36:14.297 --> 36:15.923
I ask all my girlfriends that.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.303
Yeah, a little one.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.472
Damn.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.558
What? What?

36:25.684 --> 36:27.768
- What is it?
- It's not love.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.771
You have spore in your brain.

36:31.064 --> 36:34.024
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of them.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.151
They get an earthquake,
they get released into the air,

36:36.278 --> 36:37.945
you breathe it in,
you get a cold.

36:38.071 --> 36:43.492
Turns into sinus congestion, aches,
weakness, milky tears, and sometimes

36:45.078 --> 36:47.288
loss of inhibition
and judgment.

36:48.874 --> 36:49.957
Damn!

36:50.667 --> 36:53.335
So, loving you,

36:54.588 --> 36:59.008
wanting to have sex with you
was all just the spores talking?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.431
You'll probably live.

37:08.810 --> 37:09.935
Damn!

37:34.544 --> 37:37.504
Hey! Don't touch his eye!

37:38.131 --> 37:40.007
This is an appendectomy.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.054
Like I said,
don't touch his eye.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.142
Why isn't he in surgery?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.477
Some emergency bumped him.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.686
We've got another room
in ten minutes.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.396
You're not taking him in.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.231
Kill the lights.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.903
He was seeing them
all the time.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.446
What are you looking for?

38:02.572 --> 38:04.198
He was telling us
what he was seeing.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.742
Telling us exactly
what was wrong with him.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.536
Drawing them for us over and over again.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.456
But nobody knew
how to speak autistic.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.667
When I asked him what he ate,
he even told me that.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.836
What are you talking about?
What was he seeing?

38:19.547 --> 38:23.634
Hello, my pretties.
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.929
It's worms
swimming in his eye.

38:27.889 --> 38:31.809
Animal makes potty in the sandbox,
boy plays in the sandbox.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.644
Boy eats the sand.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.604
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.356
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.359
Raccoon roundworms are not
excreted by their human host.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.694
Cameron tested the sand.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.861
All of it?

38:43.822 --> 38:46.031
Worms spread from his gut
to the rest of his body.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.576
They attacked his lungs, that's what
made him scream and caused the effusion.

38:49.703 --> 38:53.247
They invade his liver, sending dead
liver cells coursing through his system.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.749
They attacked his eye
and the muscles surrounding it,

38:55.875 --> 38:58.168
making his eyeball
do a back flip.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.296
Laser photocoagulation
to fix the eye,

39:01.423 --> 39:03.966
and a high dose of benzimidazole
to kill the worms.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.886
Wait a minute, that's it?
He's going to be okay?

39:08.596 --> 39:09.722
Good news.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.018
He's going to be with you
for a long, long time.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.152
I'm going to read you
something.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.405
"Asperger Syndrome is a mild
and rare form of autism.

39:26.531 --> 39:29.825
"It is typically characterized by
difficulty establishing friendships,

39:29.951 --> 39:34.079
"and playing with peers, trouble
accepting conventional social rules,

39:34.205 --> 39:38.208
"and they dislike any change
in setting or routine."

39:38.334 --> 39:39.877
Or broadloom.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.046
It doesn't say that last part,
but you get my point.

39:42.172 --> 39:46.717
House doesn't have Asperger's. The
diagnosis is much simpler, he's a jerk.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.594
Why do you think
he took this case?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.345
Because he
believes these parents?

39:50.472 --> 39:52.556
Because he wants to
help a young boy?

39:52.682 --> 39:58.270
He sees himself in this kid,
and he's trying to help himself.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.609
He doesn't want this,
he needs it.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.710
You're not autistic.
You don't even have Asperger's.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.128
You wish you did.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.131
That would exempt you
from the rules, give you freedom,

40:26.257 --> 40:30.511
absolve you of responsibility,
let you date 17-year-olds.

40:30.637 --> 40:34.098
But most important, it would mean
that you're not just a jerk.

40:35.141 --> 40:39.603
At what point does a person endlessly
lecturing someone make him a jerk?

40:46.653 --> 40:52.199
First tongue kiss is an eight
on the happiness scale.

40:53.743 --> 40:57.913
Child being snatched back
from the brink of death, that's a ten.

41:01.876 --> 41:05.337
They're clocking in
at a very tepid six point five,

41:06.297 --> 41:09.424
because they know what
they have to go back to.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.473
Listen,

41:18.977 --> 41:20.018
thanks.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.729
You saved his life.

41:23.565 --> 41:25.899
Yeah, I know. See ya.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.789
That was so good.

42:35.136 --> 42:37.179
That was a ten.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.909
All change is bad?

43:00.328 --> 43:02.371
It's not true, you know.
