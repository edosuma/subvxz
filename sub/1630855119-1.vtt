16:56.636 --> 17:01.434
saying how great she was, this
performative fucking shit.

17:01.468 --> 17:03.125
- Yeah, that's precisely the
reason I

17:03.160 --> 17:04.816
didn't wanna have a wake.

17:04.851 --> 17:07.095
I knew that they would all come.

17:07.129 --> 17:08.717
- And then right on cue,

17:08.751 --> 17:12.514
all the girls and Alana
are blowing up my phone

17:12.548 --> 17:17.070
to go to fucking Burnt
Bridge Lake like nothing.

17:17.105 --> 17:21.385
If there was just one goddamn
thing I wish we would do

17:21.419 --> 17:25.320
is to talk about what
is actually happening.

17:25.354 --> 17:29.289
- I'm confused. Are you
still complaining about Mom?

17:29.324 --> 17:32.465
- All of it, everything. I don't
know.

17:34.467 --> 17:38.402
Sometimes I do feel like
I am completely alone,

17:39.886 --> 17:41.750
like I'm the only one standing
there

17:41.784 --> 17:44.718
not pretending the world isn't
turning.

17:44.753 --> 17:47.273
- Is that gonna make it any
better?

17:47.307 --> 17:48.584
- What?

17:48.619 --> 17:50.897
- Like, if you acknowledge it
and, and wallow in this shit,

17:50.931 --> 17:53.589
is that gonna make you feel
better?

17:53.624 --> 17:57.766
- I think it would give us
some closure by facing it.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.528
- Filthy female cow. Make it
laugh.

18:01.563 --> 18:05.601
- You know, facing your
problem doesn't always mean

18:05.636 --> 18:07.707
that you've conquered it.

18:09.605 --> 18:11.814
You know I love you, right?

18:12.815 --> 18:14.300
But I gotta tell ya,

18:14.334 --> 18:17.613
if you're gonna spend
my summer fee fi foeing

18:17.648 --> 18:19.408
around Grandma's house,

18:19.443 --> 18:22.894
it's gonna send my brain
into hyper drive mode,

18:22.929 --> 18:26.588
and the only way that I
can purge that from myself

18:26.622 --> 18:29.315
is to blow it out with a bullet.

18:29.349 --> 18:30.868
- [sighs] You're such a dick.

18:30.902 --> 18:35.252
- So unless you would
like to go to another wake

18:35.286 --> 18:37.668
with all of our family
members blathering on

18:37.702 --> 18:40.843
about how great and wonderful I
am,

18:40.878 --> 18:44.640
I suggest that you just take a
couple

18:44.675 --> 18:47.264
of deep breaths, right?

18:47.298 --> 18:49.300
You let out some woo saws,

18:49.335 --> 18:52.959
and you just go hang out
with your fucking friends.

18:52.993 --> 18:54.443
I mean, for the first time in
two years,

18:54.478 --> 18:57.239
just be a piece of shit
like everybody else.

18:57.274 --> 19:02.279
[soft ethereal music]
[Samantha sighs]

19:09.389 --> 19:13.531
- It's gonna be really
weird without Ashley there.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.329
- Yeah, it probably will.

19:18.364 --> 19:20.952
- How am I not supposed to
imagine her

19:20.987 --> 19:25.647
in some padded room the minute
we walk into that place?

19:28.443 --> 19:32.861
- Not gonna lie to you. You
probably will, all of you.

19:34.828 --> 19:38.418
But, I mean, isn't that what you
want now?

19:39.350 --> 19:41.490
To have everybody face it?

19:42.940 --> 19:45.598
- Not one of them will even
mention it.

19:45.632 --> 19:49.257
- Well, fuck, Sam. Do they have
to?

19:49.291 --> 19:53.571
News flash, not everybody
copes the same way you do,

19:54.952 --> 19:57.610
and odds are you're probably

19:57.644 --> 19:59.715
gonna end up having a good time.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.648
And even if you don't, right?

20:01.683 --> 20:05.376
Even if you get there and you
feel shitty,

20:05.411 --> 20:09.691
maybe you can take some
comfort in the fact that,

20:09.725 --> 20:13.798
by you being there, maybe they
have less shitty of a time.

20:13.833 --> 20:17.492
It'll be your one good
deed for the summer.

20:18.941 --> 20:23.739

the strong one, remember?

20:34.785 --> 20:37.788
So are you still able to pick me
up?

20:38.892 --> 20:41.792
- Are you gonna go?
- Yeah.

20:41.826 --> 20:44.415
I think maybe getting away
for a few days could be-

20:44.450 --> 20:46.797
- [Alana] Oh my God, yes! Sam's
coming.

20:46.831 --> 20:49.869

- Yes.

20:49.903 --> 20:53.976

you still have room for me?

[tense dark music]

33:37.360 --> 33:42.365
[car hums]
[upbeat music plays on radio]

33:53.686 --> 33:58.691
[doors open]
[girls grunt]

33:59.382 --> 34:01.522
- Shangri-La.
- Hamunaptra.

34:02.730 --> 34:04.835
- Well, hello again.
- Oh my God.

34:04.870 --> 34:08.218
I'm so glad my mom kept
this house in the divorce!

34:08.253 --> 34:13.258
[women laugh]
[footsteps shuffle]

34:14.914 --> 34:16.640
Huh.
- What?

34:16.675 --> 34:18.746
- Goddamn key isn't here.

34:22.129 --> 34:24.579
Huh. Well, if that isn't
sketchy.

34:28.618 --> 34:31.862
[people speak indistinctly]
[door slams]

34:31.897 --> 34:34.072
Oh, Ron, you moron. God.

34:36.384 --> 34:38.869
- How is your brother anyway?
- Stupid.

34:38.904 --> 34:41.872
He's good. I guess they're
buying a place.

34:41.907 --> 34:44.220
- Still with Catherine Simmons?

34:44.254 --> 34:45.497
- Yep.

34:45.531 --> 34:47.568
- How's she?
- Still a cunt.

34:47.602 --> 34:48.603
[women laugh]

34:48.638 --> 34:51.227
Oh, yes! Oh my goodness, guys!

34:55.300 --> 34:56.784
- Need another beer yet?

34:56.818 --> 34:59.683
- Come on.
- What is this?

34:59.718 --> 35:01.892
What the, really? A cutting
board?

35:01.927 --> 35:04.792
God, fucking Ronald. Damn
brother.

35:05.827 --> 35:07.208
Stupid brother.

35:09.245 --> 35:11.385
- Here.
- Hit me, too.

35:12.386 --> 35:14.871
[cans clatter]

35:22.465 --> 35:24.812
- All right. What is this to?

35:25.951 --> 35:27.194
- Summer break!

35:27.228 --> 35:29.886
- [imitates buzzer] The answer
is not on the board, Miles.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.578
Alana, you got a better one?
- Gettin' fucking trashed!

35:32.613 --> 35:33.545
- Yeah!
- No, come on.

35:33.579 --> 35:35.719
We gotta have something better
than that.

35:35.754 --> 35:38.343
Let me think.
- Panther squad.

35:39.551 --> 35:41.277
- Panther squad, bitches!
- Ooh, Sam!

35:41.311 --> 35:43.589
- All right.
- Panther squad, bitches!

35:43.624 --> 35:44.970
- Cheers.
- Panther Squad.

35:45.004 --> 35:46.282
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:46.316 --> 35:47.800
- [Samantha] Cheer.

35:51.977 --> 35:53.703
- I'm surprised Mikki isn't
here.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.912
- I know. I thought she'd
beat us here by hours.

35:55.946 --> 35:58.777
- Someone should call her.

35:58.811 --> 36:01.607
- Let's see if you can
find the spot, Alana.

36:01.642 --> 36:04.886
- I mean, it's like right here.

36:04.921 --> 36:06.405
- If Mikki's still Mikki,

36:06.440 --> 36:10.306
she's probably lost and
we'll have to go find her.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.653
- Remember that one 4th of
July up here by ourselves

36:12.687 --> 36:14.655
and Mikki got lost at the
lake when the sun was setting?

36:14.689 --> 36:16.519
- Yeah, because you and her went

36:16.553 --> 36:19.349
for a walk completely shit
faced, right?

36:19.384 --> 36:20.695
- I wasn't.

36:20.730 --> 36:24.630
- Oh, I remember you being
drunk, like fucked kind of
drunk.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.701
- Oh, off that gross
malt stuff Ron bought us.

36:26.736 --> 36:28.807
- [Barbra] Oh God. [laughs]

36:28.841 --> 36:29.980
- I was not drunk.
- Found it!

36:30.015 --> 36:33.225
And then, and then we saw
you guys, then we all hid,

36:33.260 --> 36:35.848
and then Ashley jumped
out of the bushes at you.

36:35.883 --> 36:37.367
[women laugh]

36:37.402 --> 36:40.267
I knew you were there. I could
hear you.

36:40.301 --> 36:44.961
- And Mikki screamed so
loud that she peed herself.

36:44.995 --> 36:49.552
We had to come back and put
her in the bath. [laughs] Fuck.

36:49.586 --> 36:51.933
[soft music]

36:56.662 --> 37:01.322
God, was that the last time
we were up here altogether?

37:02.634 --> 37:03.497
- Yeah.

37:06.016 --> 37:08.640
Yeah, Mikki and Ashley didn't,

37:08.674 --> 37:10.676
didn't go for spring
break our senior year, so-

37:10.711 --> 37:13.679
- Didn't answer.
- She's probably close.

37:13.714 --> 37:16.958
- Yeah, at a service range on
the 101.

37:16.993 --> 37:19.720
- I call it, Miss Cleo.
- Mikki!

37:24.414 --> 37:26.692
- Oh, good afternoon, girls.

37:28.556 --> 37:30.420
Are your, your parents here

37:30.455 --> 37:32.905
or the owner of the residence,
maybe?

37:32.940 --> 37:34.666
- Well, yeah, it's my mom's
house,

37:34.700 --> 37:38.497
so is there something wrong?
- Oh, no, ma'am.

37:40.016 --> 37:42.329
We're with the National Park
Service,

37:42.363 --> 37:46.056
and we saw you guys headed up
this way,

37:46.091 --> 37:50.406
and we thought we'd just,
you know, stop in and,

37:50.440 --> 37:53.098
and let you guys know that
there is in fact still a,

37:53.132 --> 37:54.858
a burn ban and effect in the
area.

37:54.893 --> 37:58.345
So, you know, no campfires, no
grilling.

38:00.554 --> 38:03.108
I don't know if you ladies
or smokers, but, you know,

38:03.142 --> 38:06.422
just put your butts
out before tossing 'em.

38:06.456 --> 38:07.664
- Okay, thanks.

38:08.562 --> 38:11.289
- Yeah, like I said, we're just,

38:12.980 --> 38:17.364
just doing a general welfare
check of the area and-

38:19.124 --> 38:20.884
- You know, sorry to bother you,
ladies.

38:20.919 --> 38:23.370
- Yeah.
- Thank you for your time.

38:23.404 --> 38:26.096
Come on, Shawna.
- Okay, thanks.

38:26.131 --> 38:27.650
- Oh, wait, wait.

38:29.755 --> 38:33.069
So we got that emergency
service alert or whatever.

38:33.103 --> 38:38.108
[soft tense music]
[birds caw]

38:38.730 --> 38:40.697
- Okay.
- Yeah.

38:40.732 --> 38:44.529
So do you know anything about it
or?

38:44.563 --> 38:47.877
- Nah, I wouldn't worry about
that. Everything's okay.

38:47.911 --> 38:50.569
- Was it really a prison break?

38:52.813 --> 38:56.472
- Well, we don't have any
concrete information right now,

38:56.506 --> 39:00.096
and nothing's been confirmed,
so, again,

39:00.130 --> 39:00.993
nothing to worry about.

39:01.028 --> 39:02.201
Just have a great rest of your
evening.

39:02.236 --> 39:06.067
- Yeah, I mean, unless it's
Bear Grylls that escaped,

39:06.102 --> 39:08.104
think you guys are in a
pretty good spot. [laughs]

39:08.138 --> 39:10.796
- Anyway, have a great
rest of your evening.

39:10.831 --> 39:11.797
Sorry to bother you ladies,

39:11.832 --> 39:15.387
and keep that drinking to a
minimum, okay?

39:15.422 --> 39:17.044
- Okay.
- Have, have fun. [laughs]

39:17.078 --> 39:18.563
- Come on, Shawna.
- Thank you.

39:18.597 --> 39:20.772
- Yeah, Blue Lives Matter or
whatever.

39:20.806 --> 39:21.669
- Sh!

39:22.739 --> 39:24.672
Sh sh sh!
- What?

39:24.707 --> 39:26.536
- Are you trying to get us in
trouble?

39:26.571 --> 39:28.607
- Oh, fuck them.

39:28.642 --> 39:30.540
- You gotta be fucking kidding
me.

39:30.575 --> 39:31.438
- What?

39:32.680 --> 39:34.786
- I've got four delicious
little girls up in this cabin.

39:34.820 --> 39:38.203
I mean, what is this, the
Washington Chainsaw Massacre?

39:38.237 --> 39:39.066
- Well, that's what happens

39:39.100 --> 39:41.033
when you only have two peace
officers

39:41.068 --> 39:43.622
covering 20 square miles of
forest land.

39:43.657 --> 39:46.901
[tense dark music]

39:46.936 --> 39:48.489
It'll be fine.

39:48.524 --> 39:50.802
[birds caw]

39:57.533 --> 39:58.913
- What side of the bed do you
want?

39:58.948 --> 40:00.087
[soft ethereal music]

40:00.121 --> 40:05.126
[bag thuds]
[Miles chuckles]

40:14.066 --> 40:17.553
Apologies in advance,
but I just gotta say it.

40:17.587 --> 40:21.522
It's gonna be a little
weird without Ashley here.

40:21.557 --> 40:23.179
I know, it's, it's...

40:25.837 --> 40:29.841
I just had to say it.
- No, I'm so glad you did.

40:32.084 --> 40:35.502
I've been thinking the exact
same thing.

40:35.536 --> 40:39.126
It's, it's almost why I didn't
come, if I'm being honest.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.854
- I'm glad you decided
to. I miss you, Sam.

40:42.888 --> 40:46.098
- I miss you, too, and I am
having fun.

40:47.134 --> 40:48.722
- [Miles] Me, too.

40:51.794 --> 40:55.591
- Does it, does it ever
make you feel guilty?

40:58.697 --> 41:03.840
You know, that you're happy?
Does that even make sense?

41:03.875 --> 41:07.603
- Sorta. I think I know what you
mean.

41:07.637 --> 41:09.846
- You know, it's like with my
mom.

41:09.881 --> 41:13.229
You know, I, I feel guilty that
I'm okay.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.888
Everyone keeps saying how bad
they feel,

41:16.922 --> 41:21.548
and it's not that I feel
good or that I'm not sad,

41:21.582 --> 41:23.273
but, you know.
- Yeah.

41:25.759 --> 41:29.210
- Our relationship was
not the best, but still,

41:29.245 --> 41:32.144
I don't know, I feel like
karma is gonna come for me,

41:32.179 --> 41:34.906
and same with Ashley, you know?

41:34.940 --> 41:37.529
I mean, we, how do I say this?

41:42.361 --> 41:46.296
Nothing happened to us. You
know, everyone felt bad for us.

41:46.331 --> 41:47.297
We were the victims.

41:47.332 --> 41:50.197
Everyone held our hand, and, I
don't know,

41:50.231 --> 41:52.579
I feel guilty that I can come
here

41:52.613 --> 41:54.822
and, and be happy, you know?

41:54.857 --> 41:57.031
And I need to know that
I'm not the only one who,

41:57.066 --> 41:59.275
who sees it for what it is.

42:00.587 --> 42:01.588
- I guess.

42:05.350 --> 42:07.904
But let's not let
it ruin our time, you know?

42:07.939 --> 42:11.977
I don't wanna stew. It's not
good for me.

42:12.012 --> 42:13.841
Of course, I wish things were
different

42:13.876 --> 42:15.878
and Ashley were with us.

42:17.396 --> 42:20.745
- She is. Ashley will always be
with us.

42:20.779 --> 42:24.058
[tense brooding music]

42:25.128 --> 42:27.337
- Hey, are you two
assholes like going to bed

42:27.372 --> 42:29.167
or are you gonna come have a
drink?

42:29.201 --> 42:32.929
- Yeah!
- Come on! [laughs]

42:35.863 --> 42:38.279
[birds chirp]

42:48.013 --> 42:50.706
- Oh, it's gonna be
perfect for sunbathing.

42:50.740 --> 42:53.950
- Oh, I'm fucking dying in
there, dude.

42:56.263 --> 42:59.231
How do people do that?
- Easy peasy.

42:59.266 --> 43:01.061
- No. That's not fun.

43:12.244 --> 43:15.247
[soft gentle music]

43:26.396 --> 43:30.262
[people chatter indistinctly]

43:33.369 --> 43:34.232
- I know.
- Nailed it.

43:34.266 --> 43:35.751
- I don't know. It's been a long
time.

43:35.785 --> 43:36.579
- You'll get used to it.
- You know?

43:36.614 --> 43:39.340
[speaks indistinctly] or
something.

43:39.375 --> 43:42.102
- Hand me one of those, will ya?

43:43.482 --> 43:45.139
Ooh. This is great.

43:47.832 --> 43:48.971
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:51.249 --> 43:53.700
- Oh, I needed this. [laughs]

43:53.734 --> 43:56.150
[wind blows]

43:58.187 --> 43:59.844
Hey, Alana.
- Yo.

43:59.878 --> 44:01.431
- Truth or dare?

44:01.466 --> 44:03.641
- Fuck. What are we, 12?

44:04.883 --> 44:05.884
Truth.

44:05.919 --> 44:09.060
- Have you seen Chris
since you've been back?

44:09.094 --> 44:12.753
- I mean, you mean like seen,
seen him?

44:12.788 --> 44:15.169
- Like with your eyes.
Have you talked to him?

44:15.204 --> 44:16.343
- I mean, he came sulking around
here

44:16.377 --> 44:18.448
when I first got back to my
mom's.

44:18.483 --> 44:21.866
- Really? Okay, and then what
happened?

44:23.522 --> 44:27.216
- I told him to get lost.
- Really?

44:27.250 --> 44:30.012
Truthfully now, Alana.
- Am I speaking Norwegian?

44:30.046 --> 44:32.808
I told him to never contact me
again.

44:32.842 --> 44:36.328
- Okay. I guess we
must've heard wrong then.

44:36.363 --> 44:38.952
[women laugh]

44:39.953 --> 44:42.852
All right, your turn.
- Okay. Miles.

44:42.887 --> 44:45.372
Truth or dare?
- Truth.

44:45.406 --> 44:48.409
- Okay, what's the
craziest thing you've done

44:48.444 --> 44:50.377
since starting college?

44:51.516 --> 44:54.899
- Craziest?
- Or, or big or unexpected?

44:58.523 --> 45:01.181
- I mean, I came out to my dad.

45:03.114 --> 45:05.461
- Really?
- No shit.

45:05.495 --> 45:09.361
How did it old Pastor Pat take
that one?

45:09.396 --> 45:12.433
- Pretty well, actually. He kind
of knew.

45:12.468 --> 45:17.473
- That's good. Congrats.
- [laughs] Yeah.

45:17.853 --> 45:20.269
All right, Sam. Truth or dare?

45:21.235 --> 45:22.098
- Dare.

45:24.445 --> 45:28.760
Oh shit, I don't really
have a dare. Let me think.

45:30.072 --> 45:33.247
I, I dare you to-

45:33.282 --> 45:36.285
- Fuck it. Truth then.
- Okay, good.

45:40.323 --> 45:42.394
In the case of an emergency,

45:42.429 --> 45:46.985
like let's say that escaped
ex murderer comes around,

45:47.020 --> 45:49.850
who here do you trust the least?

45:49.885 --> 45:51.024
- Barb.
- What?

45:51.058 --> 45:53.095
[Alana laughs]

45:53.129 --> 45:55.166
- [Samantha] I'm sorry.
I love you, but yeah,

45:55.200 --> 45:56.443
of everyone here, it's you.

45:56.477 --> 46:01.344
- [scoffs] All right, thank you
for that.

46:02.829 --> 46:06.867
- [laughs] Okay, well then, it's
my turn,

46:06.902 --> 46:08.904
and Barb, truth or dare?

46:13.978 --> 46:15.186
- Truth, truth.

46:18.016 --> 46:20.087
- After all of this time,

46:21.502 --> 46:24.609
how do you feel about what
happened?

46:24.643 --> 46:27.957
[soft ethereal music]

46:35.309 --> 46:40.314
- Honestly, I tried everything
to not think about it at all.

46:43.455 --> 46:44.905
- Can I ask why?

46:47.287 --> 46:50.255
- I don't think it would help.

46:50.290 --> 46:51.567
- Jesus Christ, you guys!

is.

go back to pretending.

this trip

50:56.846 --> 50:58.848
could be therapeutic.

around pitying ourselves.

1:03:57.281 --> 1:03:58.144
Adam?

1:04:09.328 --> 1:04:11.848
[body drags]

1:04:17.439 --> 1:04:20.442
[footsteps shuffle]

1:04:23.376 --> 1:04:26.379
[footsteps shuffle]

1:04:30.211 --> 1:04:32.109
- I'm not cheating.
- You gotta stop cheating.

1:04:32.144 --> 1:04:34.422
- [laughs] I just-
- Hey!

1:04:34.456 --> 1:04:37.252
Are you sure he didn't come back
in here?

1:04:37.287 --> 1:04:39.289
- Who? What, who?

1:04:39.323 --> 1:04:42.395
- Adam.
- No, he was just right there.

1:04:43.603 --> 1:04:45.605
- Well, I couldn't find him.

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:48.263
[dark tense music]

1:04:48.298 --> 1:04:51.370
- [sighs] Stay here.

1:04:59.585 --> 1:05:03.347
[people whisper indistinctly]

1:05:03.382 --> 1:05:05.902
[door opens]

1:05:17.568 --> 1:05:20.088
[door shuts]

1:05:23.057 --> 1:05:26.129
- Nothing, babe.
- First Mikki then...

1:05:29.339 --> 1:05:32.307
You don't think-
- No fucking way.

1:05:32.342 --> 1:05:33.757
You guys lock the back door.

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:36.035
[tense dramatic music]

1:05:36.070 --> 1:05:37.416
- Whoa.

1:05:37.450 --> 1:05:40.039
[locks click]

1:05:41.454 --> 1:05:44.147
Whoa, what the fuck is wrong?

1:05:44.181 --> 1:05:47.046
- Okay, there's been some
really weird going on all day.

1:05:47.081 --> 1:05:48.289
- Right? Where the hell is
Mikki?

1:05:48.323 --> 1:05:50.601
- That's what I'm thinking.
- I'm calling her right now.

1:05:50.636 --> 1:05:53.570
- Okay. Hey, don't trip, all
right?

1:05:53.604 --> 1:05:56.228
He's probably just out
taking a piss somewhere.

1:05:56.262 --> 1:05:57.401
I didn't mean to freak you out.

1:05:57.436 --> 1:05:58.575
- Okay, let's just be sure.

1:05:58.609 --> 1:05:59.990
Too many weird things have
happened today

1:06:00.025 --> 1:06:02.613
to just be a coincidence,
and, to be honest,

1:06:02.648 --> 1:06:06.410
I have had this kind of weird
gut feeling about it all day.

1:06:06.445 --> 1:06:10.138
- He's probably just down
by the car taking a piss.

1:06:10.173 --> 1:06:11.036
- She's still not answering.

1:06:11.070 --> 1:06:13.141
I'm, I'm gonna, just gonna call
my mom.

1:06:13.176 --> 1:06:15.454
- Guys, this is weird.
Let's get outta here.

1:06:15.488 --> 1:06:17.490
- Just wait. It's safer inside.

1:06:17.525 --> 1:06:18.664
- Hey, Mom.
- Okay,

1:06:18.698 --> 1:06:20.321
can someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

1:06:20.355 --> 1:06:22.702
- Okay, you heard that
emergency alert earlier?

1:06:22.737 --> 1:06:24.497
Well, Barb's mom called to tell
us

1:06:24.532 --> 1:06:26.327
that somebody fucking escaped
from prison,

1:06:26.361 --> 1:06:28.122
and then we get here,
and now Mikki is missing.

1:06:28.156 --> 1:06:30.572
- And she should've been
here before we were.

1:06:30.607 --> 1:06:34.369
- Okay, as always, you
are overreacting, Alana.

1:06:34.404 --> 1:06:37.303
You, you and your friends,
they always do this.

1:06:37.338 --> 1:06:38.580
- Okay, this is serious, Chris.

1:06:38.615 --> 1:06:40.306
No one's been able to get ahold
of her.

1:06:40.341 --> 1:06:42.653
- Yeah, but plus these cops came
by

1:06:42.688 --> 1:06:44.793
doing this weird welfare
check or something.

1:06:44.828 --> 1:06:46.209
- I'm trying to hear! Shh!

1:06:46.243 --> 1:06:47.072
- You know, we would still be a
thing

1:06:47.106 --> 1:06:48.452
if it weren't for shit like
this.

1:06:48.487 --> 1:06:49.453
- Shh!
- I'm just gonna-

1:06:49.488 --> 1:06:50.799
- Sh!
- Wait, stop!

1:06:50.834 --> 1:06:52.008
- What, Mom?

1:06:53.285 --> 1:06:54.493
No, I, I was...

1:06:56.357 --> 1:06:58.807
No, I was saying, are you sure?

1:06:58.842 --> 1:07:00.292
[sighs] Okay, yeah,

1:07:00.326 --> 1:07:04.399
because she's just still
answering her phone, so.

1:07:05.297 --> 1:07:06.643
Okay. I love you.

1:07:08.231 --> 1:07:10.233
Bye.
- What did she say?

1:07:10.267 --> 1:07:14.306
- [sighs] She, [laughs] well,

1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:16.825
I feel like a fucking idiot now.

1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:21.554
That emergency service
announcement, it's a false
alarm.

1:07:21.589 --> 1:07:23.246
- Really?
- Yeah,

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:26.145
but she's gonna call Mikki's
parents

1:07:26.180 --> 1:07:30.770
and see if they've heard.
- Thank god. Jesus Christ, I-

1:07:30.805 --> 1:07:33.739
- Great. Now can I go
find my friend please?

1:07:33.773 --> 1:07:36.086
- Yeah, go for it.

1:07:36.121 --> 1:07:37.881

1:07:37.915 --> 1:07:41.160
[girls sigh]

1:07:41.195 --> 1:07:44.508
- Oh my God. My heart is still
pounding.

1:07:44.543 --> 1:07:48.236
- [laughs] Yeah, yeah.

1:07:48.271 --> 1:07:51.239
I mean, we were all thinking
the same thing, right?

1:07:51.274 --> 1:07:55.830
I suppose it is a little stupid.
[sighs]

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:58.384
- I wish my gut would agree with
you.

1:07:58.419 --> 1:08:00.490
I just can't shake the...

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:13.675
- I really hope Mikki is okay.

1:08:13.710 --> 1:08:18.715
[slow dark music]

1:08:26.516 --> 1:08:29.864
[wolf howls in distance]

1:08:30.796 --> 1:08:34.317
- Hey, Adam! Freaking out the
girls, man!

1:08:35.870 --> 1:08:39.736
I'm this close to
threesome that blond girl.

1:08:39.770 --> 1:08:41.496
Where are you? Adam!

1:08:43.291 --> 1:08:46.363
Come on, man. Freaking out the
girls.

1:08:49.470 --> 1:08:50.471
What's that?

1:08:54.716 --> 1:08:55.959
Shit.

1:09:14.288 --> 1:09:15.910
- What's Adam's deal?

1:09:17.670 --> 1:09:20.880
- I mean, I don't really know
him. Why?

1:09:22.951 --> 1:09:25.437
- He seemed like a nice guy.

1:09:25.471 --> 1:09:29.406
I mean, I really questioned
his taste in friends, but-

1:09:29.441 --> 1:09:32.927
- Yeah, look, Sam. No.
- Seriously.

1:09:32.961 --> 1:09:34.100
- Yeah,

1:09:34.135 --> 1:09:37.380
we do not need another friend
with a toxic boyfriend.

1:09:37.414 --> 1:09:40.452
- I'm laying right here.
- Okay, calm down.

1:09:40.486 --> 1:09:42.730
It's just, I'm going
to be here this summer,

1:09:42.764 --> 1:09:45.560
and he actually seemed like a
nice guy.

1:09:45.595 --> 1:09:48.874
- Yeah, everybody seems like a
nice guy.

1:09:50.289 --> 1:09:53.879
Please, girl. Do not
pull an Alana. [laughs]

1:09:53.913 --> 1:09:55.294
- Still right here!

[dark tense music]

1:10:00.644 --> 1:10:05.235
Oh my God. There they are.
- Good. Now they can leave.

1:10:06.926 --> 1:10:08.721
- I thought I told you-

1:10:08.756 --> 1:10:11.241
Whoa! Call 911!
- What?

1:10:11.276 --> 1:10:13.001
- [Alana] Stay away from the
windows!

1:10:13.036 --> 1:10:14.900

We have to run. We have to go.

1:12:05.010 --> 1:12:07.115
We have to go. Okay, okay?

1:12:07.150 --> 1:12:08.738
We're gonna make a run for it.

1:12:08.772 --> 1:12:10.705
Okay, make a run for it.

1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:11.603
Look.

1:12:15.503 --> 1:12:17.471
Okay, let's go, let's go.

1:14:25.702 --> 1:14:26.634
- Sam, Sam.

1:14:28.947 --> 1:14:30.638
We have to lock ourselves
in here. Come on.

1:14:30.673 --> 1:14:33.123
- No, we have to lock the
front door. I heard him leave.

1:14:33.158 --> 1:14:36.886
Just, I'll be right back.
- Oh, fuck it then.

1:14:44.721 --> 1:14:46.205
- Use the deadbolt.

- No, no. I, I don't, I
don't know where it is.

1:15:09.643 --> 1:15:12.715
- Jesus. Oh fuck, I
thought we were all dead.

1:15:12.749 --> 1:15:15.718
- We have to lock the
back door and the windows.

1:15:15.752 --> 1:15:17.064
- No, we need to call somebody.

1:15:17.098 --> 1:15:20.032

God.

Hey. Where is Miles and Alana?

1:15:31.147 --> 1:15:34.012
- They made a run for it, I
think.

1:15:37.291 --> 1:15:39.293
Whose is that?
- I dunno.

1:15:50.787 --> 1:15:52.340
It's Mikki's wallet.

1:16:00.245 --> 1:16:03.386
Ashley, is, is this because of
Ashley?

1:16:03.420 --> 1:16:06.700

1:17:27.746 --> 1:17:28.713
I need you to slam it behind me.

1:17:28.747 --> 1:17:30.438
I'm gonna go to the car. I'm
gonna get in.

1:17:30.473 --> 1:17:31.750
I'm gonna bring it up to
the front of the house

1:17:31.785 --> 1:17:33.959
as close as I get to the front
door.

1:17:33.994 --> 1:17:36.790
And then whatever you do,
whatever you do,

1:17:36.824 --> 1:17:40.103
do not lock this door because
if they are out there,

1:17:40.138 --> 1:17:42.036
I'm gonna have to get in quick,

1:17:42.071 --> 1:17:46.282
but once I'm back, we can
go into the car and get out.

1:17:46.316 --> 1:17:47.904

1:17:47.939 --> 1:17:49.872
I'll get right over to the car.

1:17:49.906 --> 1:17:52.357

get this thing up there,

1:17:52.391 --> 1:17:53.599
no matter what is out there,

1:17:53.634 --> 1:17:57.465
so I don't want you to come
out running into a buzz saw.

1:17:57.500 --> 1:17:59.951
- I can take care of myself.

1:18:01.884 --> 1:18:04.680
- Okay, all right. Are you
ready?

1:18:08.545 --> 1:18:11.134

Mrs. Fisher.
