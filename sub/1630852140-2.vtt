I missed you."

I was there with you."

As far as Kevin and Wells...

34:52.179 --> 34:54.159
I don't know.

I really like Wells.

With Kevin,
he's a really nice guy.

between him and Skyler,

35:10.210 --> 35:13.000
and I do like Skyler.

35:13.019 --> 35:14.190
This is my thought process.

35:14.210 --> 35:16.210
If I keep Kevin around,

35:16.230 --> 35:19.000
he can form that bond
with Skyler

35:19.019 --> 35:22.079

my relationship with Anthony.

35:22.099 --> 35:25.030

is attractive,

a little more difficult.

a lot of things going on

at the bottom for me.

I'm interested in Faith.

to cover--
