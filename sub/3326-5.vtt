00:01.043 --> 00:02.453
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.670 --> 00:05.207
Someone ask her if she's
ever played lacrosse.

00:06.716 --> 00:08.047
The kid's got some
serious anger issues.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.128
Does anyone recognize
the handle "Benefactor"?

00:10.595 --> 00:13.177
- What do you hear?
- The key to break the code.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.173
- It's a dead pool.
- He's an assassin.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.395
Our friend just sent me a text.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.896
The sun, the moon, the truth.

01:58.244 --> 02:02.738
The sun, the moon, the truth.

03:09.899 --> 03:10.934
Get in!

03:11.150 --> 03:12.811
Come on, she's coming, get in!

03:17.615 --> 03:18.604
Seﬁoudy?

03:19.241 --> 03:20.777
I can't believe you fell for that.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.655
So, the Walcotts were the first.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.577
At least the first that we know about.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.206
Four murders.
Sean, his brother, and their parents.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.876
They were killed by a
professional assassin called The Mute.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.297
Weapon of choice, a military tomahawk.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.216
But then The Mute
was killed by Peter Hale

04:21.429 --> 04:23.966
after he tried to blow up Derek
with a Claymore mine.

04:34.650 --> 04:35.730
Next was Demarco.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.184
He delivered a keg
to the party at Lydia 's lake house.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.898
And got decapitated outside his car.

04:43.576 --> 04:44.816
Does the scent tell you anything?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.242
Definitely a werewolf.
But there's more.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.744
I think he was part of a pack.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.912
Well, if he was,
they'll be looking for him.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.456
And then last night,

04:57.715 --> 04:59.080
23-year-old Carrie Hudson.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.335
It's a dead pool.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.633
A hit list of supernatural creatures.

05:03.596 --> 05:05.052
This is only part of it.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.004
The rest still has to be decoded.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.887
- Who found this list?
- Lydia.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.021
- How?
- She wrote it.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.097
Actually, she transcribed it.
Without realizing it.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.682
- Banshee?
- Banshee.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.233
Beautiful.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.777
All right, what are
these numbers next to the names?

05:21.989 --> 05:22.944
We're getting to that.

05:23.157 --> 05:26.024
First, you need to know that
the code was broken with a cipher key.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.904
Wait.You mean, like a...
Like a key word?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.530
It's actually a name.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.331
Allison.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.420
Her name broke a third of the list.

05:40.633 --> 05:44.342
And now we think there's
two other cipher keys.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.636
Which will give us
the rest of the names.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.837
Okay.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.803
So how do we get the cipher keys?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.600
Same way we got the code.

05:53.771 --> 05:54.601
Lydia.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.980
She's been at the lake house all weekend
trying to find the other two key words.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.168
You didn't know about
Demarco or Carrie. Hmm?

07:04.383 --> 07:05.884
And what about these
other two names on the list?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.667
Uh, Kayleen Bettcher and Elias Town.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.553
- They werewolves too?
- I don't know.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.507
But Deaton said that the Nemeton would
draw supernatural creatures here.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.597
Here being Beacon Hills?
Or Beacon County?

07:18.188 --> 07:20.315
The population of Beacon Hills
is just under 30,000.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.517
And dropping.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.567
But if we're talking Beacon County,

07:26.155 --> 07:28.612
then you're looking at close to 500,000.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.325
Look, how many werewolves,

07:33.537 --> 07:34.993
banshees, kitsunes

07:35.205 --> 07:37.947
and whatever the hell
else is out there are we talking about?

07:38.667 --> 07:41.955
And what happens if the next cipher key
uncovers not 12 names

07:42.171 --> 07:43.832
- but 100?
- We don't think there would be that many.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.837
- There's a limit.
- Because of the numbers.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.171
We think that
once we decode the names,

07:50.387 --> 07:52.503
the numbers will add up to H7.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.506
117 what?

07:55.684 --> 07:56.639
Million.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.486
One hundred and seventeen
million dollars, Dad.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.942
Stolen from the Hale vault

08:11.116 --> 08:14.108
and is being used by someone
to finance all these murders.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.035
Someone who wants
every supernatural in Beacon Hills dead.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.172
So the coded list goes out.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.673
And somehow these
professional assassins get that list.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.052
And a cipher key.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.095
And then they go after
the names on the list.

08:36.266 --> 08:39.133
They being killers with no mouths,

08:39.770 --> 08:43.137
tomahawks, thermo-cut wires
that can take your head off.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.476
Let me see.
Carrie was also stabbed.

08:45.985 --> 08:46.974
What's this mark?

08:47.152 --> 08:49.985
We're not sure yet.
We're waiting on the M.E.'s report.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.445
There's one other thing I don't get.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.991
How did this new assassin
know that Demarco

08:56.203 --> 08:57.488
was going to be at the lake house?

08:57.663 --> 09:00.871
Everyone knows he delivers kegs
to teenagers for a little extra cash.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.538
Ah.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.831
So whoever ordered that keg

09:07.673 --> 09:10.289
- killed Demarco.
- Yeah, it was someone at the party.

09:10.676 --> 09:11.916
A student.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.514
You all right?

09:19.768 --> 09:21.850
I can handle a scratch or two

09:22.062 --> 09:24.519
if I know we're eventually
going for the real money.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.188
The seven figure money.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.773
- We are.
- When?

09:29.445 --> 09:30.560
Tonight.

09:39.455 --> 09:41.195
It's not that we were
wanting to talk to you.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.077
It's that we were wondering
if you wanted to talk to us.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.373
About what?

09:45.586 --> 09:47.702
About something that
you forgot to mention?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.786
- Something important.
- How important?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.042
Exceptionally.

09:53.010 --> 09:53.999
Oh, God.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.297
You know?

09:58.432 --> 09:59.763
We know.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.634
Look, l was going to tell you.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.640
We were going to tell you everything.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.563
About the dead pool,
the assassins, the killings.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.645
But I didn't want you to worry.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.819
l was talking about you
joining the lacrosse team.

10:15.741 --> 10:16.696
Oh.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.275
Then never mind.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.828
Dead pool?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.496
You know how I keep reminding Garrett
to give me back my hoodie?

10:29.213 --> 10:30.202
Yeah.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.414
Well, I remembered you said he lived in
that housing development on Spaulding.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.503
So I went there and guess what?

10:35.719 --> 10:38.677
The housing development
is still in development.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.550
- So?
- There are no houses yet.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.303
So unless the dude
lives in some backhoe,

10:43.519 --> 10:45.134
there's something he's not telling us.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.222
And then there's this
other dude, man, he's...

10:49.441 --> 10:52.399
He's been acting really strange.
Running to school for no reason.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.689
Disappearing at parties.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.317
Used to be my best friend.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.864
And he was apparently on steroids.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.990
What?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.618
You're not actually
going to try to lift that, are you?

11:10.295 --> 11:13.378
Are you all right?
I mean, is it about the game tonight?

11:13.632 --> 11:15.714
I'm fine.
It's just a scrimmage.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.382
You know who you're playing, right?

11:17.678 --> 11:18.713
Yeah.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.673
I mean, no.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.138
I guess I missed the announcement.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.716
Liam, it's your old school.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.555
Devenford Prep.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.771
What the hell?

11:41.493 --> 11:42.778
Where's my stick?

12:08.937 --> 12:09.892
Is this yours?

12:31.585 --> 12:32.916
Liam.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.675
You're right. He is angry.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.972
This one's yours.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.188
Get to class, Liam.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.243
What are you smiling about?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.834
- You're gonna be good at this.
- Are you kidding?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.296
I am totally unprepared.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.548
Remember how you said
you could teach me a few things?

13:25.764 --> 13:28.801
I think, right now
I could use a full-on training manual.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.632
I'll tell you one thing.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.467
That anger he's got?

13:33.063 --> 13:35.349
- It'll make him strong.
- And dangerous.

13:35.899 --> 13:36.854
Very.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.689
This was supposed to be the semester
I could focus on school again.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.829
But Kate's back.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.160
And I've got a Beta.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.004
And there's a dead pool.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.048
If all our names are on that list,
then that's what we should be focused on.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.881
Do you think Lydia
can get that second key?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.762
She's working on it.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.278
Please stop hovering.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.526
I'm not hovering. I'm waiting.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.608
Draw something. Write something.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.444
We need to know
who else is on that list.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.497
You mean, you need to
know if you're on the list.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.495
If someone's coming
to take my head off,

14:37.711 --> 14:39.576
then, yeah, I'd like to know.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.883
Can you please just sit down?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.553
You're making me nervous.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.683
Sorry.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.911
- Lydia.
- What?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.531
Oh, my God, what?

15:16.958 --> 15:18.368
Maybe we need help.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.829
From another banshee.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.837
Meredith.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.752
Economic disparity

15:29.971 --> 15:31.381
exists in all forms.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.963
Well, take sports, for example.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.099
Some teams have better training facilities.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.222
Some have better equipment.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.887
Unlike Beacon Hills

15:40.107 --> 15:43.395
that can barely afford the duct tape
to keep our equipment together.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.609
You know, Stilinski,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.660
if I could grade you
on how profoundly you disturb me,

15:52.869 --> 15:55.155
you'd be an A plus student.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.861
Thanks, Coach.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.909
Put those pictures away.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.377
Stilinski!

16:08.969 --> 16:10.175
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:12.097 --> 16:13.052
Don't answer that.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.561
It's a lacrosse player.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.438
The killer's on the team.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.616
This... This is pointless.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.238
Most of the team
plays with their own gear.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.036
Maybe instead of trying
to find a lacrosse stick

16:38.206 --> 16:39.161
with a hidden dagger in it,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.833
we should be trying
to get the game canceled?

16:41.376 --> 16:43.617
The game's the best
way to catch him red-handed.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.452
But what if he's red-handed
'cause his hands are covered

16:45.672 --> 16:48.084
in the blood of the person
that he just stabbed to death?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.837
Which, by the way,
could be either of you guys.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.258
Or Liam.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.010
Well, we don't have
the whole list and he could be on it.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.763
We don't know anything about the list.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.057
How it's made, how it's updated.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.469
I mean, who's been out
taking a supernatural census anyway?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.607
How do they even know about me?

17:04.816 --> 17:05.931
They know about everyone.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.352
I think Kira's right.
I think we should stop the game.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.158
I'm not afraid.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.030
Neither am I.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.033
Well, I'm terrified.
And I'm not even on the list.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.035
Guys, these are professional killers.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.996
It's their profession.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.204
One of them's got
a thermo-cut wire that cuts heads off.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.580
Who knows what else they have?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.165
Wolfsbane.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.133
That's wolfsbane?

17:36.723 --> 17:37.883
I thought it was purple.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.556
Not this species.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.727
Which is very rare and very expensive.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.270
What's that supposed to mean?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.892
"Don't screw up"?

17:49.444 --> 17:50.650
Don't miss.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.654
Okay, all you have
to do is nick him. It'll work fast.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.362
Even on an Alpha.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.153
We gonna do this again?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.207
I'm just saying I don't know
why we're going after a Beta

18:05.418 --> 18:06.624
when there's an Alpha on the field.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.623
Because an entire pack of
Alphas went after McCall

18:09.839 --> 18:11.625
and he was the one left standing.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.041
It's a lot of money.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.300
So is the Beta.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.618
Eichen House says
Meredith can't have visitors

18:42.831 --> 18:44.116
without permission
from a family member.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.324
That's not gonna be easy
since her whole family is dead.

18:47.544 --> 18:48.533
Peﬂect

18:48.753 --> 18:51.005
Okay, maybe we go back to the art room?
Or music room?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.497
I'm not plucking piano strings
for two hours

18:54.718 --> 18:56.879
waiting for some
supernatural inspiration.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.131
Fine. What else do banshees do?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.386
You think I know?

19:03.184 --> 19:05.175
| can'tjust turn this on.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.852
I'm not like you guys.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.142
I don't have claws,

19:10.358 --> 19:11.939
or glowing eyes

19:12.110 --> 19:13.475
or super senses.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.483
| just have voices in my head.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.085
Liam, wait. What, no, no, no, no.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.333
Liam.

19:34.549 --> 19:35.629
Brett!

19:38.845 --> 19:39.834
Ah, here we go.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.601
| just wanted to say...

19:50.440 --> 19:51.725
Have a good game.

19:54.819 --> 19:55.934
That's cute, Liam.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.852
Is that what they told you
to say in Anger Management?

19:58.073 --> 20:00.280
Apologize and everything's fine?

20:02.202 --> 20:04.113
You demolished Coach's car.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.860
I paid for it.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.946
Yeah, you're going to pay for it.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.581
We're gonna break you
in half out there.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.749
And it's gonna be all your fault.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's go.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.672
Hey, what's going on, prep students?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.675
Welcome to our little
public high school. How you doing?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.303
Stiles. That's a firm
handshake you got there.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.558
Uh, we're very excited
for the scrimmage tonight.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.888
Uh, but Let's keep it clean, all right?
No rough stuff out there.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.565
All right, see you on the field.
Go.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.081
Okay, you calm yet?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.085
Okay! Okay!

21:05.765 --> 21:08.177
That car you smashed.
I thought you said that was your teacher's.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.224
He was also my coach.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.143
He benched me for the entire season.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.188
What did you do?

21:16.025 --> 21:18.311
- I got a couple of red cards.
- Just a couple?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.317
You gotta be honest with us.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.825
- What else happened?
- Nothing.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.696
I got kicked out of school.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.828
They sent me to
a psychologist for evaluation.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.250
What did they call it?

21:36.713 --> 21:38.578
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.833
|.E.D?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.506
You're literally an LED?
That's great.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.880
That's great. You gave
superpowers to a walking time bomb.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.472
Did they give you anything for it?

21:46.681 --> 21:47.841
Risperdal.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.056
It's an antipsychotic.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.257
Oh, this just gets better.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.218
- But I don't take it.
- Obviously.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.096
I can't play lacrosse on it.
It makes me too tired.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.102
Okay.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.976
I think you should bail out of the game.
Tell Coach your leg is still hurting.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.235
No, no!

22:04.783 --> 22:06.364
I can do this.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.403
Especially if you're there.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.698
But, Liam, it's notjust about the game.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.289
We think whoever killed Demarco

22:15.502 --> 22:16.833
might be on our team.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.629
Who's Demarco?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.453
The one who brought
the beer to the party.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.379
The guy who was beheaded.
Remember?

22:22.592 --> 22:23.923
We think the person
who ordered the keg

22:24.135 --> 22:25.375
killed Demarco.

22:28.765 --> 22:29.720
Liam?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.136
What, you know something?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.104
I don't know who ordered the keg.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.231
But I know who paid for it.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.954
Shouldn't we do something now?

23:00.797 --> 23:02.583
I mean, we can't.
We're still not really sure if it's really him.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.836
And if we're wrong,
then the real assassin gets away.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.885
Nervous?

23:10.974 --> 23:12.760
About someone trying to kill us?

23:12.976 --> 23:14.716
Or about playing my first game?

23:16.020 --> 23:17.271
Both?

23:22.026 --> 23:23.482
Definitely both.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.437
Hey, Dad, you're supposed to be here.
Where the hell are you?

23:26.656 --> 23:27.645
I'm leaving now.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.608
And this conversation
isn't getting me there any quicker.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.618
Sheriff, I know you're in a hurry,
but I was out on patrol

23:33.830 --> 23:37.618
and I found someone
walking from the coast to the High School.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.245
That's gotta be at least 15 miles.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.751
She was pretty determined.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.253
I'm looking for Lydia.

23:56.394 --> 23:58.009
I don't care if he's a foot taller than me.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.228
I think I can take him.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.560
Yeah.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.240
What do you think you're doing?

24:13.453 --> 24:14.738
What? Me?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.660
Agreeing with you.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.746
I'm being agreeable.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.998
- You think he's hot, don't you?
- No!

24:24.172 --> 24:26.458
No. Not at all. No way!

24:28.593 --> 24:29.548
Maybe.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.209
Yeah, maybe a little.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.843
- He wants to destroy me.
- I think you could definitely take him.

24:36.768 --> 24:39.134
And then give him to me.

24:43.733 --> 24:47.021
No, no just go out there
and kick their smug prep school asses.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.775
All right.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.729
She was here for this.

25:29.696 --> 25:33.484
We use it to teach young Betas how to
control the shifts on a full moon.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.237
Control was
never one of Kate's strengths.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.325
You knew she was alive, didn't you?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.125
Not for certain.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.752
But I'd been searching ever since
you handed me the shotgun shell.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.835
That's not possible.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.846
What are you gonna do
when you find her?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.011
There's a place I can take her.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.523
You saying you have
some kind of werewolf jail?

26:10.111 --> 26:11.976
Something like that.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.236
She won't go quietly.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.739
I don't expect her to.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.401
And I'll do what's necessary.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.748
What if I asked you not to?

26:30.173 --> 26:31.754
She took something from me.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.009
At first,

26:38.181 --> 26:40.263
ljust thought it was a part of my past.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.016
I started to lose something else.

26:46.647 --> 26:47.727
My sense of smell.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.563
I'm losing my power.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.860
Let's go!

26:55.031 --> 26:55.986
Let's go, come on!

26:56.157 --> 26:58.193
Hey, McCall, I said get
your ass out on the field.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.195
But, Coach, his leg's still healing.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.072
I don't think he should play.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.403
He said it's fine.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.577
As Captain, I'm suggesting
Liam sit out the game.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.586
And as, uh,
President of the United States,

27:12.799 --> 27:15.006
I'm vetoing that suggestion.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.424
What if he gets hurt?

27:16.636 --> 27:18.046
Hey, Liam! Think fast!

27:20.973 --> 27:22.224
Oh, he plays.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.391
There you go, Liam! Liam!

27:33.611 --> 27:36.273
Stilinski! McCall!

28:00.388 --> 28:02.003
Why do I feel like
this is going to end badly?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.512
Because it usually does.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.261
Kira, you keep an eye on Garrett.
I'll watch out for Liam.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.219
Yeah, I'm just gonna try to play lacrosse.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.518
All right.

28:25.746 --> 28:26.952
Brett,

28:27.165 --> 28:30.077
I know you guys feel like you owe Liam
some payback for what he did

28:30.293 --> 28:32.955
but could you just hold off
for one night?

28:33.129 --> 28:35.211
Trust me. One night.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.421
Yeah, I can do that.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.840
- Really?
- No.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.461
Liam!

29:02.533 --> 29:03.488
Liam!

29:24.138 --> 29:26.254
I'm aware this is probably
about the dead pool,

29:26.474 --> 29:27.964
but I can't let her leave the station.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.345
And, in about a minute,
I'm gonna have to call Eichen House

29:30.561 --> 29:32.017
and let them know that she's here.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.560
Give us an hour.

29:34.565 --> 29:35.805
You got 15 minutes.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.730
You called Lydia?

29:41.781 --> 29:42.736
Yeah.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.444
Because Meredith asked for her
or because of the other thing?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.198
What other thing?

29:50.331 --> 29:51.320
The psychic thing.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.917
- You think Lydia's psychic?
- Do you?

29:54.543 --> 29:57.376
No, I do not. I think that she is, uh...

29:58.673 --> 29:59.708
Intuitive.

29:59.924 --> 30:02.836
That's what they used to call psychics.
Intuitionists.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.463
Yeah, And I used to call myself
a rational human being.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.591
Get in here and shut the door.

30:10.893 --> 30:12.679
Ask what you need to ask.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.522
Meredith,
aren't you going to answer it?

30:31.789 --> 30:33.745
It's not ringing.

30:44.885 --> 30:48.503
You guys know that anabolic steroids
are illegal in the United States?

30:49.265 --> 30:51.551
You wear a lot of facial hair
for a teenager.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.883
What are you on? Seriously? HGH?

30:54.103 --> 30:55.468
Gamma radiation?

31:00.276 --> 31:02.733
Run Kira! Run, Kira, run!

31:08.409 --> 31:09.364
Pass it!

31:10.036 --> 31:11.276
Kira, pass the ball!

31:16.792 --> 31:17.656
Oh...

31:31.390 --> 31:32.891
Yukimura!

31:33.100 --> 31:34.135
Get over here.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.974
Take a seat.
You're benched for the rest of the game.

31:39.148 --> 31:40.934
- What? Why?
- You didn't pass.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.482
- I had an open shot.
- The play was for you to pass.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.394
This is a scrimmage,
It's about teamwork, Yukimura.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.024
So, you're benched.

32:11.472 --> 32:12.632
Meredith,

32:13.766 --> 32:15.882
you came here to help us,
remember?

32:17.770 --> 32:18.976
You called me.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.059
What do you mean I called you?

32:23.943 --> 32:25.308
I heard you.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.736
Meredith, can I ask you a question?

32:34.161 --> 32:35.321
When you need help,

32:35.996 --> 32:37.577
when you need to find something,

32:37.790 --> 32:39.781
is there someone you reach out to?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.456
Maybe someone you call?

32:44.004 --> 32:45.164
It depends.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.588
Different people for different things.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.798
So maybe there's
a number that can help us?

32:50.010 --> 32:51.511
Someone we can call.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.426
Yes.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.721
- Would you be okay telling us?
- Yes.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.104
It's two,

33:02.857 --> 33:04.188
four,

33:05.526 --> 33:06.732
three,

33:08.654 --> 33:09.734
six.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.902
Mer, we need a few more numbers.

33:19.748 --> 33:20.703
No.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.623
That's the number.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.918
Phone numbers are 10 digits.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.708
- That's the number.
- Meredith,

33:27.923 --> 33:30.005
phone numbers
always have 10 digits.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.007
That's the number.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.554
- Meredith...
- Lydia.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.628
Hey. Come here.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.933
I think that's the best we're gonna get.

33:41.937 --> 33:42.892
No.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.433
There has to be more.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.893
What's the rest of it, Meredith?
Hmm?

33:51.530 --> 33:54.021
- Just concentrate!
- But that's... That's...

33:54.241 --> 33:56.072
- That's the number.
- Just concentrate.

33:56.285 --> 33:57.741
That's... That's the number.

33:58.579 --> 33:59.819
That's the number.

34:00.456 --> 34:01.571
It's okay, sweetheart.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.746
- We're gonna get you...
- That's the number!

34:38.953 --> 34:43.196
In Mexico,
we just call this a standoff.

34:59.223 --> 35:01.179
Brett, you okay?

35:02.059 --> 35:03.720
Okay, back off!

35:06.105 --> 35:07.185
Back off!

35:09.733 --> 35:12.691
- How hard did you hit him?
- I didn't.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.651
He hit me.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.399
Ow.

35:23.414 --> 35:25.075
Close your eyes.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.589
All right, Brett,
we're gonna pick you up now.

35:47.688 --> 35:51.647
- Are you cut? Did Garrett cut you?
- No, no. I'm okay.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.060
Then he missed.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.687
What do you mean?

36:00.492 --> 36:03.404
It's you, Liam.
You're the one he's after.

36:35.778 --> 36:38.394
Lydia, what if it's like algebra?

36:38.614 --> 36:40.445
What do you mean?

36:42.159 --> 36:45.026
What if the numbers
are actually letters?

36:57.800 --> 36:58.880
Oh, God...

37:24.743 --> 37:27.701
I talked to Coach.
I'm out for the rest of the game.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.204
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.328
Something's still not right.
We're missing something.

37:33.544 --> 37:34.533
Guys.

37:34.795 --> 37:37.127
Lydia just broke
another third of the list.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.795
Am I on it?

37:39.007 --> 37:40.963
No. But someone else is.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.684
What did you do to me?

37:57.484 --> 37:59.224
You were cut with a poisoned blade.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.609
It was laced with wolfsbane.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.897
It won't kill you.
But this will.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.828
Why? Why are you doing this?

38:12.791 --> 38:14.907
Because you're worth
a lot of money, Brett.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.257
Sorry,
I was just seeing if you guys were okay.

38:28.766 --> 38:30.131
You need a ride home?

38:30.768 --> 38:33.054
Uh, no. We'll be fine.

39:03.801 --> 39:07.214
He said we shouldn't try.
But now I've got you. I got an Alpha.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.575
I think you better call your dad.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.578
The girl we hired to find Kate

39:39.127 --> 39:40.788
hasn't responded in days.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.833
- You know her, don't you?
- Braeden.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.916
Well, maybe your sister got to her.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.046
Maybe killed her.

39:49.763 --> 39:54.757
Maybe we should stop
hiring other people to do our work.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.854
Maybe we do it ourselves.

40:06.154 --> 40:10.739
We're hunters, Christopher.
All of us. We follow a code.

40:10.993 --> 40:14.656
Severo, what is our code?

40:16.081 --> 40:18.914
We hunt those who hunt us.

40:20.586 --> 40:21.746
Christopher?

40:23.005 --> 40:24.791
What is our code?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.256
Say it with me.

40:29.428 --> 40:33.592
We hunt those who hunt us.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.840
What is our code?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.930
Remind him, Severo.

40:41.815 --> 40:46.104
We hunt those who hunt us.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.151
Say it, Christopher.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.615
Say it for your wife, Victoria.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.398
For your daughter, Allison.

40:54.536 --> 40:55.696
Say the code.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.827
Speak the words.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.496
Say it!

41:00.083 --> 41:01.823
What is our code?

41:04.963 --> 41:06.749
We hunt those

41:10.218 --> 41:11.754
who hunt us.
