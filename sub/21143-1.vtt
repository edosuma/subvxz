01:00.680 --> 01:02.477
In association with...

01:03.280 --> 01:05.191
Tree House Comix, Inc.!

01:05.360 --> 01:08.033
Inc., Inc., Inc.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.272
All right, okay. So.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.000
A long, long,
long, long time ago...

01:13.320 --> 01:15.595
in a galaxy far, far away...

01:15.800 --> 01:17.836
there was a planet called
Underpantyworld.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.160
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
Okay, go.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.256
That's perfect.
That's perfect. Okay.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.396
Underpantyworld was
a peaceful planet

01:25.520 --> 01:27.670
where everybody wore
only underwear.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.236
Until it started to blow up
for some reason.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.351
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Da-da.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.670
Meanwhile, the leaders
of Underpantyworld...

01:34.840 --> 01:37.434
Big Daddy Longjohns and his
wife, Princess Pantyhose...

01:37.520 --> 01:38.669
...saved their baby

01:38.800 --> 01:40.677
by stretching his underwear
really far...

01:40.840 --> 01:42.160
and then
they shot him into space.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.952
Godspeed, little Underpants.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
Whee!

01:46.520 --> 01:47.635
Whee!

01:47.840 --> 01:49.114
And then he crashed on Earth,

01:49.200 --> 01:50.872
where he was raised
by some nice...

01:51.600 --> 01:52.669
Dolphins?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.518
Yeah, dolphins.
Just go with it.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.795
Okay, fine.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.336
Goo-goo, gah-gah.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.191
Tra-la-la-la-la-la.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.352
But the space baby
grew up fast.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.038
Look! Up in the sky!

02:07.200 --> 02:08.713
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

02:08.880 --> 02:11.110
It's an egg salad sandwich.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.396
And guess what? I'm rotten.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.720
Faster than
a speeding waistband.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.880
More powerful

02:19.000 --> 02:20.672
- than boxer shorts.
- Yay!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.639
You'll never catch me,
Captain Underpants.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.518
Owie.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.070
Able to leap tall buildings
without getting a wedgie.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.798
Hey, all right.
Good for you, pal.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.911
Now put on some clothes,
you weirdo.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
No way.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.557
I fight for truth, justice,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.870
and all that is
pre-shrunk and cottony.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.473
For I am...

02:43.760 --> 02:45.910
Captain Underpants!

02:47.600 --> 02:48.999
The origin issue.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.072
It's so good. We should've
done an origin issue ages ago.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.912
Yeah, like, first.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.736
You know, I'm not sure
about the dolphins, though.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.909
Yeah, I know. It's just...

02:57.080 --> 02:58.136
I didn't know if it was
the thing where it's,

02:58.160 --> 02:59.673
like, good weird or bad weird.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.560
Like, is it something...

03:01.600 --> 03:02.999
The origin issue!

03:03.200 --> 03:04.952
I've told you two
a thousand times

03:05.080 --> 03:06.752
not to draw
these idiotic comics!

03:06.920 --> 03:07.920
Freeze!

03:08.120 --> 03:10.270
Hey, everybody!
Wait one second.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.668
Hi. I'm George Beard.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.256
And this is my best friend,
Harold Hutchins.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.759
Hey. Ah, man.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.598
It's okay. We got more ideas.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.189
See, Harold loves to draw
and I love to tell stories.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.191
And this old guy looking angry
right here...

03:21.360 --> 03:23.430
well, this is the worst
principal in the world...

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Mr. Krupp.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.597
Mean old Mr. Krupp.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.398
Hates anything fun.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.033
Like comic books...

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
recess...

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
Christmas.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.234
Ho, ho, whoa!

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
Even kittens!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.312
Oh, my goodness.
Did that really happen?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.311
Uh, no, not technically.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.959
But it might as well have!

03:46.600 --> 03:48.750
I'm sorry.
I'm still mad about the comic.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.148
Yeah, me too.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.715
And unfreeze.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.110
In my office, now!

04:06.800 --> 04:08.438
What is happening right now?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.993
I don't know.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.040
Do you think he fell
asleep with his eyes open?

04:13.080 --> 04:15.514
Maybe. Let's try and leave
and see what happens.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.316
Door lock activated.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.630
Wow. That's an expensive door.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.473
It was a choice between the
magnetic automatic door closer...

04:30.640 --> 04:32.949
and the music
and arts programs.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.440
Pretty sure
I made the right choice.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.513
This morning's school sign
is supposed to read...

04:42.680 --> 04:45.433
"Sewage plant field trips
are today."

04:45.880 --> 04:49.270
So can either of you explain
why it now reads...

04:49.440 --> 04:52.193
"Come see my hairy armpits?"

04:54.200 --> 04:55.713
I know you two
are responsible.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.856
How? How do you know?
Do you have any proof?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.200
I mean,
this is a country of laws.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.315
The proof is here.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.549
Inside my gut.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.551
He must have
a lot of proof in there.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.712
Quiet fives.
Quiet fives.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.800
Hmm.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.155
Ever since you attended
this elementary school...

05:09.320 --> 05:12.392
you've been responsible
for one prank after another.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.312
Shh...

05:37.560 --> 05:38.754
Wow, that's a lot of pranks.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.600
Yeah, when it's cut
all together like that,

05:40.680 --> 05:42.080
you really get a sense
of the scope.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.056
Some of those must've been
really hard to pull off.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.877
And dangerous.
Like that tiger.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.268
Oh, that tiger was crazy.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.431
For four long years...

05:49.600 --> 05:50.656
you two have been disrupting

05:50.680 --> 05:53.877
the carefully calibrated,
drone-like beehive...

05:54.080 --> 05:56.878
that this elementary school
is supposed to be.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.756
I may not be able
to prove it yet...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.349
but I'm gonna get you two
one day.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.956
One day very, very soon.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.112
All right.
Fair enough.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.272
Get out of my office. Now!

06:14.760 --> 06:16.079
You see what we're up against?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.959
And that's just a typical day
at Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.799
More like
Jerome Horwitz Penitentiary.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.274
Hey, guys.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.475
What's going on, Tommy?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.312
Same old, same old.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.437
Poor kid.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.477
Time to have fun with history.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.631
Memorize these dates.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.557
1827, 1853, 1914, 1926.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.631
First graders.
Always hits them the hardest.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.319
Hold on a sec.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.956
So that's why
we do what we do.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.997
He's left us no choice.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.559
Our pranks and practical jokes

06:52.680 --> 06:54.238
are the last line
of defense...

06:54.400 --> 06:56.994
against the injustice
of our terrible principal.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.673
Well, well, well.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.229
I heard you both got into

07:00.320 --> 07:01.833
a bit of
the old trouble today.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.120
How'd you hear that, Melvin?

07:03.240 --> 07:04.832
Did you tattle-tale on us?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.990
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.588
I did.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.273
Someone has to
stand up for the Man.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.510
No one has to
stand up for the Man.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.113
That's the whole point
of the Man.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.838
He stands up
for himself, Melvin.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.359
Respectfully disagree.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.856
Attention, everyone.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.016
Principal Krupp here

07:30.040 --> 07:31.109
with an announcement.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.193
This Saturday is the mandatory
Invention Convention.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.475
Boo!
Oh, what?

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
Yes!

07:37.680 --> 07:39.318
That's our third Saturday
this month!

07:39.520 --> 07:42.796
You must be here with
your inventions at 8:00 am.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.360
Is there no justice?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.675
I know that's early
for Saturday, but don't worry.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.016
You should be done by 9:00...

07:48.040 --> 07:49.040
pm.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.400
Tree house?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
Tree house.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.911
Welcome to
the world headquarters

08:31.000 --> 08:32.910
of Tree House Comix, Inc.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.753
Yep. This is
where the magic happens.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.193
Not, like, actual magic.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.113
No, we're not
practicing the dark arts.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.994
No, here we just hang out
and make comics

08:45.120 --> 08:46.439
and try to
make each other laugh.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.752
That's how we became friends.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.079
This is me in kindygarten.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.754
And this is me.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.239
George and I
aren't friends yet.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.400
But we're about to be.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.348
The seventh planet
from the sun is called...

09:00.200 --> 09:01.553
Uranus.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.395
Scientists refer to Uranus...

09:08.560 --> 09:10.039
Your anus.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.456
...as one of the planets...

09:11.480 --> 09:12.959
I know.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.150
...known as a gas giant.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.715
I don't get it.
It's just science, guys.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.319
As I was saying...

09:26.480 --> 09:27.549
Hey, I'm George. You wanna

09:27.640 --> 09:28.976
hang out in my tree house
after school?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.274
You have a tree house?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.312
Ever since then, we've created
hundreds of comics in here.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.313
Like the Wrath of
the Wicked Wedgie Woman.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.948
And who could forget Sad Worm?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.997
It was a worm who was sad.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.914
That one's
still a work in progress.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.071
But the all-time
greatest superhero

09:52.160 --> 09:54.276
that we've ever created was...

09:54.920 --> 09:58.071
The Amazing
Captain Underpants.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.275
See, most superheroes
look like

10:01.360 --> 10:03.191
they're flying around
in their underwear.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.158
Well, this guy actually does.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.111
Come on, let's get to work.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.873
Hey, tell me what you think.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.877
Oh, I can't wait to draw this.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.200
Tra-la-laaa!

10:19.360 --> 10:20.952
Wait, wait.
Don't move, don't move.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.674
Mr. Hutchins, I gotta say...

10:31.840 --> 10:33.336
your drawings get better
with every issue.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.033
Because your words
inspire greatness, Mr. Beard.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.309
Good night, Harold.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.515
Good night, George.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.839
I love Saturday

10:57.000 --> 10:59.992
When anything is possible

11:00.760 --> 11:03.228
I love Saturday

11:03.400 --> 11:06.870
'Cause I can wear
my pajamas all all day

11:07.600 --> 11:09.352
I love Saturday

11:09.560 --> 11:12.870
'Cause I can watch
TV all day Day

11:13.040 --> 11:16.237
I can pee a little bit
in my underwear

11:16.440 --> 11:20.194
And no one will mind

11:20.280 --> 11:21.696
Where are you going with that?
Do you really do that?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.278
No. What are you talking...

11:23.680 --> 11:25.511
It's just something
I could do because...

11:25.680 --> 11:28.831
Monday's an eternity away

11:31.080 --> 11:34.595
When it is Saturday
Saturday

11:34.760 --> 11:36.016
Get in the car, boys.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.951
You've got the
Invention Convention today.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.600
This thing on?

11:56.400 --> 11:57.879
Quick announcement.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.793
Our science teacher, Mr. Fyde,
is no longer with us.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.240
He's dead?

12:04.720 --> 12:05.755
What? No. Not like that.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.797
He wanted to spend Saturday
with his family.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.154
So I fired him.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.753
I'll find a replacement
next week.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.273
Ahem! Anyway...

12:12.440 --> 12:16.319
on to Melvin Sneedly
with the first of his 16...

12:16.840 --> 12:18.432
Actually, it's 17.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.158
...17 inventions.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.639
Take it away, Melvin.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.389
I will now demonstrate
a prototype which I call...

12:25.560 --> 12:27.949
the Robotic Sock Matcher.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.633
Never waste time matching
your own socks again.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.791
The Electromagnetic
Lint Collector.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.154
Digital Paper Sorter.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.151
It's the homework...
Automatic cushion.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.475
Make it end!

12:39.640 --> 12:43.155
And the personal favorite,
the binder binder.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.828
Having trouble
organizing your binders?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.993
Well, look no further
than this giant binder...

12:50.200 --> 12:51.315
for binders.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.336
Three-hole punch...

12:53.360 --> 12:54.839
This is the stuff
of nightmares.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.456
We have to do
something about this.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.711
I don't know. Krupp looks
serious this time, George.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.416
Maybe we should
just lay low for a while.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.193
Lay low?
Look at our fellow children.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.796
Look upon their sad,
miserable, pathetic faces.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.315
Come on, Harold.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.656
If you won't do it for me
and you won't do it for you...

13:16.680 --> 13:18.398
do it for future generations.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.993
Save the first graders...

13:20.160 --> 13:21.878
the kindygarteners,
the unborn...

13:22.040 --> 13:23.871
from a life
of eternal boredom!

13:32.400 --> 13:33.879
Okay, let's do this.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.196
Feast your eyes on this.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.670
The Turbo Toilet 2000!

13:40.240 --> 13:41.468
Check it out, people.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.709
It's already programmed with

13:42.880 --> 13:43.960
my personal potty playlist.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
Screwdriver.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.880
Oh, samba!

13:48.880 --> 13:50.800
Once you're done
using the facilities...

13:50.880 --> 13:54.714
hit the button
and let my toilet wash itself.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.148
Now included, automatic
toilet paper wiping claw.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.878
Trademark.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
Um...

14:05.240 --> 14:06.240
I said no!

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
Huh? Oh...

14:11.120 --> 14:12.553
Melvin, turn that thing off.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.917
I'm trying to,
but it's not cooperating.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.789
Best.
Prank.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
Ever.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.913
Well, that brings our story
to its happy conclusion.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.520
I hope you've all
enjoyed the film.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.278
It was certainly shorter
than we expected.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.629
What more is there to say?

14:55.800 --> 14:57.995
Our fellow students got
to enjoy their weekend.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.311
Which, by the way,
they are legally entitled to.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.313
And good triumphed over evil
once and for...

15:04.480 --> 15:08.314
Oh, boys! A moment, please.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.713
What's happening to his face?

15:16.840 --> 15:19.195
I think he's smiling.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.032
I'm so cold.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.551
So, so cold.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.029
I'll let myself in,
receptionist lady.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.680
Melvin.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.875
What's he doing here?

15:29.040 --> 15:32.191
You see, Melvin
is yet to demonstrate...

15:32.360 --> 15:34.999
his most impressive invention
from today.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.430
It was a little
extracurricular project

15:37.520 --> 15:39.715
I asked him
to come up with myself.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.678
I call him
the Tattle Turtle 200.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.513
On the outside,
it resembles a turtle.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.353
But on the inside,
oh, look at this.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.509
It's a nanny cam!

15:51.720 --> 15:53.950
Oh, Melvin. How fun.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.031
Let's see what it recorded.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.871
Yeah, you gotta change
the input to video.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
I think I got this.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.599
You're on AUX.
Change it to video.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.795
It's not my TV.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.216
It's your turtle.
You're doing it wrong.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.309
I know.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.914
I think I know
how to do my office.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.835
Screwdriver.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.793
Is this two-ply or one-ply?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.073
We're so guilty.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.999
Quiet fives. Quiet fives.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.273
Wow, that nanny cam

16:29.400 --> 16:30.753
really has good
picture quality.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.920
Was that hi-def?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.155
'Cause you could
really tell that's us.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.790
I can't believe it.
I gotcha.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.399
I finally gotcha!

16:40.000 --> 16:42.070
We've finally got them, sir.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.073
Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin.
Extra credit granted.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.071
Put that in my pocket.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.309
Extra credit,
it feels so good!

16:52.480 --> 16:54.277
I got extra credit

16:54.440 --> 16:56.476
I told you
I would get you one day.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.279
And that day
I was talking about

16:59.360 --> 17:00.588
is this day.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.115
Today. This is the day.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.976
Are you going to tell
our parents?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.434
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.148
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

17:11.319 --> 17:15.790
Because I'm going to have
you two placed in separate...

17:17.119 --> 17:18.269
classes.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.976
I'm going to annihilate
your friendship.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
What? No!

17:22.359 --> 17:25.193
You see?
You won't be together.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.192
You won't be able to enjoy

17:27.280 --> 17:29.714
each other's company
and ruin my life.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.189
Mr. Krupp, no.
You can't do this. Please.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.470
This is too much.
I mean, even for you.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.631
Enjoy the rest
of your weekend, boys.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.472
Because come Monday...

17:47.160 --> 17:51.199
Separate classes.
Our friendship's over.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.839
I'll never see you again
in my life!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.638
Hey, hey. Calm down.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.068
It's not the end of the world.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.360
We'll still be best friends.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.835
Just way down the hall
from each other.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.990
What am I talking about?
This is bad.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.071
Long distance relationships
never work!

18:07.840 --> 18:09.319
This is just the beginning.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.159
Imagine the future.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.989
Friends separated...

18:18.560 --> 18:20.710
promising each other
they'll remain besties.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.279
But within months,

18:30.360 --> 18:32.669
we'll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.199
Hey, George.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.032
Hey. Do I know you?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.952
You'll have a weird haircut.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.270
I'll be wearing
a suit for some reason.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.555
And before we know it,

18:41.720 --> 18:43.560
separate classes
will lead to separate lives...

18:43.600 --> 18:45.636
which inevitably
leads to robots.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.551
What? Why are there robots
at the mall?

18:48.720 --> 18:51.109
Because this is the future!
The future always has robots.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.753
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.791
Why are the robots
shooting other robots?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.320
Aren't they
supposed to be friends?

18:56.440 --> 18:57.440
I don't know!

18:57.600 --> 18:58.696
I'm the artist,
you're the writer.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.948
That's why we need each other.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.074
Help! Fire!

19:14.400 --> 19:16.391
Okay, you're right.
No, you are right.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.312
I mean, if we get put
in separate classes,

19:18.400 --> 19:20.118
it's the end of the world
as we know it.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.429
What are we gonna do?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.431
Oh, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.598
First thing Monday morning,
we're getting that turtle.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.280
Edith!

19:35.600 --> 19:36.953
Oh, is this a bad time?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.753
I did not mean to interrupt
the copying process.

19:39.920 --> 19:40.920
I'll go.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.160
Yes, go! Please go.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.356
No, no. I'm just finishing up.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.108
What brings you around here?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.434
I just made
this tuna casserole...

19:52.600 --> 19:55.114
and I noticed
it had your name on it...

19:55.280 --> 19:57.589
in jalapeno peppers.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.994
Mmm...

19:59.280 --> 20:01.271
It smells spicy.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.953
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.270
That's 'cause it's been
dry-aged for a week.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.839
I don't know what that means,

20:06.960 --> 20:08.439
but it sounds
very time-consuming.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.959
It took a week.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.634
Eww. They like each other.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.631
Oh, no, George.
I think it's much worse.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.518
They like-like each other.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.760
What are you talking about?

20:17.840 --> 20:19.558
Adults don't
like-like other adults.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.336
Well, you probably haven't
seen it at your home

20:21.360 --> 20:22.560
since your parents
are married.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.313
In my studies, like-liking
seems to end with marriage.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.776
Well, I should probably get
back to running the school.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.597
You know,
it's not gonna run itself.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.354
But...

20:33.480 --> 20:37.871
Oh, Edith. Get your head
out of the clouds.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.071
Wait, Edith! You never gave me
the tuna casserole.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.678
I think
he forgot the turtle.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.068
Go, go, go.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.674
That's important.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.398
Great. What now?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.194
Hello.
If you would like the chance

20:57.360 --> 20:59.157
to win one billion dollars...
Ooh.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.078
please hold for
one of our representatives.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.078
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
Ugh.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.519
Whoa!
What?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.875
Everything Krupp
ever confiscated from us.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.712
Look at all that stuff.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.638
Oh, dear old whoopee cushion.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.552
You will sing once again.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.556
Oh, my
Super Duper Soaking Machine!

21:38.200 --> 21:39.269
My hypno-ring!

21:39.400 --> 21:41.470
I never even got to take it
out of the wrapper.

21:42.520 --> 21:43.520
Wow.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
Look at this.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.256
He's got every issue
of Captain Underpants

21:46.280 --> 21:47.315
we've ever created.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.480
You think he reads them?

21:48.640 --> 21:49.856
I was kinda hoping
that we appealed

21:49.880 --> 21:51.598
to a slightly
cooler demographic.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.997
Well, if it isn't George Beard
and Harold Hutchins.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.151
To what do I owe the pleasure?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.072
Is it perhaps this?

22:00.160 --> 22:01.309
Oh, no.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.629
Nice try.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.751
Turtle and I have grown
quite attached.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.558
We're inseparable, actually.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.239
I carry him wherever I go.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.675
Including the shower!

22:12.600 --> 22:13.953
Oh.
Poor turtle.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.919
Oh, what's this?

22:19.920 --> 22:20.920
Why, it's the paperwork

22:21.000 --> 22:22.911
to separate you two.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.309
It's really incredible.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.910
I can actually see
the end of your friendship.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.435
And it ends right here.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.591
On this dotted line.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.793
George, do something.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.999
Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp...

22:37.160 --> 22:38.513
or we'll hypnotize you.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
What?
What?

22:39.840 --> 22:40.989
You said do something.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.195
What is that?

22:42.360 --> 22:45.989
Forged from the molten
plastic of Shandong, China.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.628
In the lowest floor
of the darkest basement

22:48.800 --> 22:51.792
where only toy prizes
dare be made...

22:51.960 --> 22:53.791
exists the most
powerful item...

22:53.960 --> 22:57.350
ever to be found in a box
of Frosted Sugar Doodles.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.951
The hypno-ring.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.635
Hypnotize me?

23:01.720 --> 23:03.517
With that piece
of plastic junk?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.869
Does that really work?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.996
What do you think?
I got it out of a cereal box.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.229
I'm warning you.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.456
If you don't do what we say,

23:10.480 --> 23:11.680
you're gonna
get really sleepy.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.400
Oh, will I?
I'll get sleepy?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.198
With that thing
pointing at me?

23:16.360 --> 23:17.998
It's not making me sleepy.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.718
I'm not gonna
get sleepy from...

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
Whoa!

23:26.840 --> 23:29.354
What kind of
plastic hokum is this?

23:29.520 --> 23:30.635
Whoa!

23:30.840 --> 23:32.016
What's happening?
I don't know.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.678
Why are we floating?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.159
What was that?

23:49.360 --> 23:50.429
I don't know.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.160
I honestly didn't think
that would happen.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.200
Gotcha. You're safe now,
little turtle.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.039
When I snap my fingers,

24:04.120 --> 24:05.872
you will obey
our every command.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.359
Wait. How do you know this?

24:07.520 --> 24:08.656
I don't know.
I just say the first thing

24:08.680 --> 24:10.336
that comes to my mind
with great authority.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.510
You are now a chicken.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
It worked!

24:25.200 --> 24:26.269
He's a chicken.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.708
Okay, let me try. Let me try.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.794
You're a monkey.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.711
Oh! Look at him,
he's a monkey!

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
Come on.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.715
You are now

24:47.840 --> 24:50.718
the greatest superhero
of all time...

24:50.920 --> 24:53.514
the amazing
Captain Underpants!

25:08.280 --> 25:11.033
Tra-la-laaaaa!

25:12.440 --> 25:15.910
Captain Underpants?
Is that really you?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.674
Let's see.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.592
Underpants, check.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.955
Captain, also check.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.357
I'm pretty sure
I'm Captain Underpants.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
It worked!

25:29.880 --> 25:32.440
Which must make you
my trusty sidekicks!

25:32.840 --> 25:33.840
Sidekicks?

25:34.280 --> 25:37.636
Fear not, this planet is safe
under my watchful eye.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.438
This is hilarious!
This is amazing!

25:39.720 --> 25:40.948
Let's see what's afoot.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
Wait, no!

25:44.960 --> 25:46.791
Well, that was invigorating.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.473
We gotta stop him.
Why?

25:49.760 --> 25:50.760
Huzzah!

25:50.800 --> 25:51.800
Out of the road, bozo!

25:51.960 --> 25:53.678
Why, thank you,
vehicle person!

25:53.880 --> 25:54.915
Ow!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.513
Yeah, we should
probably go get him.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.271
Captain Underpants, wait!

26:04.360 --> 26:05.679
Oh!
Ha-ha!

26:06.080 --> 26:07.080
What is this?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.518
Poor soul. You're trapped

26:09.640 --> 26:12.473
in some sort of
invisible box-like prison.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.074
What's that? I can't hear you.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.912
But I see your tears.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.150
Is it okay
that I'm kinda loving this?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.151
Yes and no. But mostly yes.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.991
Fear not,
for I will set you free!

26:24.080 --> 26:25.080
Ow!
Ooh!

26:25.200 --> 26:26.315
What is wrong with you?

26:26.520 --> 26:28.158
Ah, that's better.
I can hear you now.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.033
Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.240
Okay, listen, let's not be

26:31.360 --> 26:32.656
punching people,
though, because...

26:32.680 --> 26:33.999
Hold it.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.353
Here, let me help.
Oh!

26:36.440 --> 26:38.351
You're welcome, madam.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.856
You know,
we should probably get you

26:39.880 --> 26:41.496
back to the school
before anything else...

26:41.520 --> 26:42.520
Halt!
What?

26:42.680 --> 26:44.352
Do you sense that?
No.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.560
Well, of course you don't.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.193
You're not a superhero
like me.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.590
Come, sidekicks.
Evil lurks within!

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
Oh, no!

26:53.360 --> 26:54.713
Where'd he go now?

26:54.920 --> 26:56.956
To the sky!

27:06.440 --> 27:08.296
You'd think a guy like him
would be easy to find.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
Found him.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.954
Stand down,
you giant ape monster!

27:12.120 --> 27:14.759
Giant ape monster?
What is he talking...

27:15.320 --> 27:18.710
Your days of terrifying
this town are over!

27:18.880 --> 27:20.632
Mr. Krupp!
I mean, Captain Underpants!

27:20.800 --> 27:23.234
You can't actually fly!

27:23.400 --> 27:25.311
Now I take to the sky...

27:25.480 --> 27:26.595
like an ostrich!

27:30.480 --> 27:32.118
I gotcha!

27:35.960 --> 27:37.598
We gotta do something.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.074
I've got an idea.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.433
Morning.
Morning.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.477
Oh, that is a lot of buttons.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.750
Take that! Ah, cheap shot!

27:52.120 --> 27:53.917
Ow! Right in the kisser!

27:55.480 --> 27:56.480
No!

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
Oh, hi, guys!

28:00.920 --> 28:01.955
Wait! No!

28:02.320 --> 28:03.355
Follow that gorilla!

28:05.440 --> 28:07.271
Oh, you put up a good fight!

28:10.440 --> 28:13.352
Yeah! You are so good
at operating a crane, Harold.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.272
I know!
It's really not that hard.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.160
Rest assured,

28:17.200 --> 28:18.838
citizens of
this marvelous metropolis...

28:19.000 --> 28:21.639
I will rid you of this menace
any moment now!

28:21.840 --> 28:24.638
Come on. Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.994
Victory!

28:26.160 --> 28:27.434
Yes!
Bravo!

28:27.640 --> 28:28.868
Oh, no, no, no!

28:32.840 --> 28:36.150
Let that be a lesson
to evildoers everywhere.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.477
Never underestimate the power
of underwear!

28:39.640 --> 28:41.392
Who the heck are you?

28:41.480 --> 28:42.480
What the...

28:47.800 --> 28:50.473
Wow! I can't believe
we found a spot.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.029
Oh, goodness.
Grandpa, you did it again.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.629
He's a sleepwalker.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.870
Come on, pap pap,
let's get you back into bed.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.720
But what about all the other
evil villains?

28:58.920 --> 29:00.114
Well, don't worry about that.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.840
There's no more
evil villains around here.

29:03.880 --> 29:06.838
A science teacher, hmm?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.991
The perfect cover.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.830
Chums! What
an astounding headquarters.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.877
Stuffed full of relics...

29:21.040 --> 29:24.237
all celebrating
my interplanetary exploits!

29:24.400 --> 29:25.992
Oh, this takes me back.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.396
What are we gonna do?
He can't just stay here.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.073
We have to turn him back
into Krupp.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.798
I know,
but can we just take a moment

29:31.880 --> 29:33.600
to acknowledge
what's happening here please?

29:33.720 --> 29:37.554
I mean, Captain Underpants is
hanging out in our tree house!

29:38.200 --> 29:40.077
Look at
the cute little turtle.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.918
Oh, he's so adorable.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.078
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.350
Now it is time to fly again!

29:48.520 --> 29:49.794
No, no, no, no!

29:51.640 --> 29:52.640
Where am I?

29:52.800 --> 29:54.074
Where are my pants?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.275
Oh, no! He's Krupp again.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.759
Ah!

29:57.080 --> 29:58.718
Tra-la-laaa!

29:58.880 --> 30:00.960
That's it! Now we know
what turns him back and forth.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.189
Turns who what?

30:02.720 --> 30:03.720
Why am I soaking wet?

30:03.880 --> 30:05.029
Cool.
Hey.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.878
Tra-la-laaa!

30:07.040 --> 30:08.917
Harold!
Tra-la...

30:09.080 --> 30:10.798
George!
Laaa!

30:10.960 --> 30:12.109
We should probably stop.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.395
Yeah, we probably should.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.391
Stop doing this!
Tra-la...

30:15.480 --> 30:17.118
I am Captain...

30:17.440 --> 30:18.576
What are you doing?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Hello? Well, hello!

30:19.760 --> 30:21.557
What's happening?
Fear not!

30:21.720 --> 30:23.376
Didn't know I could do this.
Hey, sidekicks!

30:23.400 --> 30:24.799
Tra! Hey! Heyo!

30:27.920 --> 30:28.989
Tra-la-laaa!

30:31.760 --> 30:33.113
Okay, this is the street.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.680
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.913
Evening.
Evening.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.115
Drop it. No, get off. Gimme!
That's a bad dog.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.955
We made it.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.760
Yeesh.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.990
I wonder
what horrors lie inside.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.991
There's probably
wild dogs in there.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.560
Probably torture implements.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Rabid rats.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.749
Brains in jars.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.439
Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.318
Bones of former students.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.709
Why'd you scream?

31:14.880 --> 31:16.632
I just assumed
there'd be something scary...

31:17.200 --> 31:18.713
but it's actually
a really nice place.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.680
We probably
shouldn't snoop around.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.671
Yeah. Definitely not.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.200
Come on.

31:35.960 --> 31:36.960
Huh.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
Hmm.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.991
Not So Cheery O's?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.151
This guy's
bumming me out.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.910
I gotta say, this has
not been the funnest snoop.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.197
Yeah, no, totally.
Really sad snoop.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.157
Kinda regretting it, actually.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.720
I sure hope we don't ever
end up like him.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.359
All alone.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.640
It's impossible.
That would never happen.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.711
Yeah, yeah.
That'll never happen.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.518
Unless he puts us
in separate classes.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.270
Which will never happen.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.272
It'll never happen.
'Cause we control him now.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.078
And if ever gives us
any trouble again,

32:32.200 --> 32:33.872
all we gotta do
is snap our fingers...

32:34.040 --> 32:35.439
and "Tra-la-laa!"

32:35.640 --> 32:38.074
All of our problems go away.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.032
Oh, yeah

32:58.120 --> 32:59.553
Beautiful

33:04.560 --> 33:06.710
Even more beautiful

33:10.600 --> 33:11.720
Hey, Tommy. What's going on?

33:11.800 --> 33:12.800
Hey, guys.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.911
Whoa! Cool shirts!

33:16.120 --> 33:17.758
What are you two
doing together?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.799
I separated you.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.760
No, you didn't.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.949
What are you talking about?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.429
I signed the paperwork. See?

33:25.520 --> 33:26.520
I don't see a signature.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.736
Harold, do you see
a signature?

33:27.760 --> 33:29.239
Not a thing.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.800
I actually can't see a thing.
These sunglasses are too dark.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.309
What? I could have sworn
I signed that thing.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.835
No matter. There!

33:37.000 --> 33:38.592
Officially separated.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.352
Forever.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.272
What? Give me that.
Tra-la-laaa!

33:45.440 --> 33:46.998
See? Problem solved.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.032
Ooh!

33:50.760 --> 33:52.432
Greetings, citizens!

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
Quick, in here.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.075
Okay, you know what?

33:58.160 --> 33:59.639
These shirts
were way premature.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.119
Definitely. Come on.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.416
Let's turn him back
into Krupp.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.510
We can't. He'll separate us,
remember?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.096
Yeah, well, we can't have him

34:06.120 --> 34:07.553
wandering around
looking like that.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.870
A triangle!

34:09.960 --> 34:12.235
It dings!

34:26.159 --> 34:28.754
Ah! Principal Krupp,
you caught us again.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.638
You better take us
to your office

34:31.760 --> 34:33.591
for a good old talking-to.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.878
Right? Principal Krupp?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.335
Principal who?

34:37.360 --> 34:38.873
Captain Underpants,
get out here.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
Sidekicks...

34:41.199 --> 34:42.199
are you sure

34:42.320 --> 34:44.038
my secret identity
requires these...

34:44.679 --> 34:47.353
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
Yes, positive.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.518
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

34:51.679 --> 34:52.715
Oh, right.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.353
How does a principal act?

34:54.480 --> 34:55.480
Mean!

34:55.520 --> 34:56.554
Okey-doke.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.519
I'm a principal!

35:02.040 --> 35:03.040
Oh, yeah. That's great.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.193
Come on. We're almost there.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.836
Oh, hello. Surprise.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.033
It's Edith.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.191
Did you like
my tuna casserole?

35:13.880 --> 35:15.677
I cannot lie.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.394
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.357
What? Oh.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.919
But if your casserole is

35:22.040 --> 35:25.237
as striking
as your one blue eye...

35:25.720 --> 35:28.359
Oh, I didn't think
you noticed.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.760
Oh, my.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.916
Two blue eyes.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.877
Ooh!

35:36.720 --> 35:38.392
Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.709
Gotta wrap it up.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.029
Very well then.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.389
Up, up, and...

35:42.560 --> 35:44.551
And this way, sir.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.713
Ooh! Flirt alert.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.233
A-ha!

35:50.440 --> 35:51.839
Wow, she's still on hold.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.232
Phew! We made it.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.118
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

35:57.280 --> 35:58.320
Oh, and hello to you, too.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.431
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

36:00.600 --> 36:02.238
from your broken window.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.118
It's in the shape of a man.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.480
Anyway, I am here to interview

36:05.600 --> 36:07.113
for the science teacher
position.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.633
Perfect. I'm disguised

36:08.760 --> 36:10.193
as an elementary
school principal.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.913
Guys, I totally got this.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.593
Don't worry one bit.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.074
Now, where did I put
that resume?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.440
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.440
This one's fun.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.794
Ooh!
Heads up.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.399
That one's gonna leave a mark.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.913
I've been looking for that.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.120
Oh, not that.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.789
Ah-ha! Here we go.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.077
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

36:38.240 --> 36:39.434
Not exactly.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.591
But you have
teaching experience?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.119
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.391
Not even, like, babysitting?

36:45.560 --> 36:46.788
I would never sit on a baby.

36:46.960 --> 36:47.960
Camp counselor?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.394
Never was a camp counselor.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.079
Although
I did receive counseling...

36:51.240 --> 36:54.471
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.468
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.596
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.955
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

37:02.120 --> 37:03.314
Mad...

37:03.680 --> 37:06.990
genius inventor.
But yes.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.111
And then for
the last few years...

37:09.280 --> 37:10.952
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

37:11.160 --> 37:12.354
and your title was...

37:12.520 --> 37:14.431
"Revenge Seeker?"

37:14.600 --> 37:15.953
"Revenge at all costs...

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
"Die! Die!"

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
Am I reading this right?

37:18.440 --> 37:20.510
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

37:20.680 --> 37:22.432
so here I am!

37:22.600 --> 37:23.749
Applying for a job in

37:23.840 --> 37:26.308
the thriving
public school system...

37:26.480 --> 37:29.677
with all of
its amazing resources.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.033
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.792
So innocent.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.952
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

37:38.120 --> 37:41.032
a joy-adjacent feeling.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.509
As long
as they are controlled...

37:43.680 --> 37:46.478
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.198
Children must never laugh!

37:49.000 --> 37:50.831
Well, you seem terrific!

37:51.000 --> 37:52.149
You're hired!

37:52.320 --> 37:53.878
What?
Excellent.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.036
Oh, by the way,
going to need Fridays off...

37:56.200 --> 37:58.077
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

37:58.240 --> 37:59.514
for my evil experiments.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.353
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

38:04.000 --> 38:05.069
Oh, this is bad.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.515
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

38:07.680 --> 38:10.035
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.317
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.710
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.393
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

38:16.600 --> 38:18.875
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.190
You got it. Grr...

38:26.720 --> 38:27.720
Ooh!

38:28.400 --> 38:30.356
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.910
What?
How did I get here?

38:33.120 --> 38:34.348
Why is my face wet?

38:47.520 --> 38:48.714
Hiya, class.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.233
I'm your cool, new teacher.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.631
Not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.188
Anyway, I'm just going to dive
right in here.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.588
If there was one thing

38:59.720 --> 39:01.320
about this world
that you could change...

39:01.760 --> 39:02.760
what would it be?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.751
Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.911
Unattainable. Anyone else?

39:07.760 --> 39:09.432
Pacific Ocean into chocolate.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.079
Atlantic into nacho cheese.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.633
It's like
we're the same person

39:12.760 --> 39:13.909
and yet so, so different.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.758
I love it.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.558
But more importantly...

39:17.720 --> 39:21.110
if I had to change one thing
about the world...

39:21.280 --> 39:24.955
it would be to get rid of...

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
laughter.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.839
Get rid of laughter?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.558
What kind of person
wants to do that?

39:31.680 --> 39:32.680
Oh, oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.800
Yes?

39:33.880 --> 39:34.880
I love it.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.791
Oh, look at this.
We got a grade A suck-up.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.837
Good to know, good to know.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Anyway.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.995
This is the brain
of an average child.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.195
Right here is

39:46.320 --> 39:48.276
the "thinking about candy"
lopalus.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.476
The "fear of
what's under the bed" lobe.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.154
This is the "only thing
I'll eat is pizza...

39:53.320 --> 39:55.993
"chicken nuggets,
or buttered noodles" lobe.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.758
Right here is the

39:57.840 --> 39:59.671
"as soon as
someone else has a toy...

39:59.840 --> 40:02.274
"I want that toy"
anterior lobe.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.159
And this...

40:04.960 --> 40:08.157
This is the
Hahaguffawchuckleamalus.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.710
This funny little purple part

40:10.840 --> 40:14.150
holds our entire capacity
for laughter.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.709
For years,
I've tried to shrink it

40:16.840 --> 40:18.796
or cut it out entirely...

40:20.680 --> 40:22.432
but frustratingly,

40:22.520 --> 40:25.512
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.795
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.200
But the stuff
I am understanding

40:30.320 --> 40:31.514
seems genuinely bad to me.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.874
Yeah, same.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.952
Um... Excuse me, Professor P?

40:36.160 --> 40:37.991
Why are you trying to
get rid of laughter?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.519
Isn't laughter
the best medicine?

40:39.680 --> 40:43.150
Medicine is the best medicine!
So...

40:43.360 --> 40:44.475
Yeesh.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.880
What?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.080
What does the P stand for?

40:48.560 --> 40:49.560
Excuse me?

40:49.640 --> 40:51.870
The P. In your name.
What does it stand for?

40:52.040 --> 40:53.519
Oh, it's private.

40:53.720 --> 40:57.076
So that means your name is
Professor Privates?

41:00.200 --> 41:01.713
What's so funny?

41:01.880 --> 41:03.074
I don't get it.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.595
Principal's office, now!

41:05.720 --> 41:06.720
You too!

41:06.880 --> 41:07.995
Why him?

41:08.160 --> 41:10.594
Because your friendship
and shared sense of humor

41:10.720 --> 41:11.869
irritates me...

41:12.040 --> 41:14.235
and must be destroyed!

41:15.880 --> 41:17.960
We gotta do something about
that new science teacher.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.395
Yeah, it's like he's even more
of a villain than Krupp.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.278
I didn't even think
that was possible.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.936
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
Tell me about it.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.598
What? Who do you think...

41:25.760 --> 41:27.600
Oh, okay. Maybe we could
fix this if we just...

41:27.720 --> 41:29.280
Can you hear me?
No, that'll never work.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.197
I'm sitting right here.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.794
Wait, Professor P doesn't want
anybody to know his last name.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.029
Right?
Right!

41:35.200 --> 41:36.872
Who's Professor P?
Exactly!

41:37.040 --> 41:40.749
Where is the respect?
I am your principal!

41:41.640 --> 41:42.789
Wait, is he Krupp again?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.791
George!
Yup. Pretty sure he is.

41:44.920 --> 41:45.920
Harold!

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
How'd that even happen?

41:48.120 --> 41:49.872
Tra-la-laaa!

41:50.040 --> 41:53.077
Greetings!
I need to get the...

41:53.280 --> 41:54.520
Sidekicks,
what do I need again?

41:54.600 --> 41:56.875
The file
on the new science teacher.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.960
Oh, right, right.

41:58.040 --> 42:00.429
I need the bile
on the gooey fence creature.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.794
Science teacher.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
The dewy tense preacher?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.277
The dial on the...

42:06.440 --> 42:07.759
Oh, come on!

42:07.960 --> 42:09.916
Thank you, human woman!

42:10.560 --> 42:11.913
Sidekicks, explain to me

42:12.000 --> 42:13.797
the importance
of this secret file.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.320
There's a new
super villain in town

42:15.400 --> 42:17.040
and we're trying to
discover his weakness.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.120
Oh...

42:22.440 --> 42:24.271
"Poopypants."

42:25.520 --> 42:27.636
Hallelujah

42:27.800 --> 42:29.597
Hallelujah

42:29.760 --> 42:31.955
His name is Poopypants
We found his weakness

42:32.120 --> 42:34.111
Hallelujah

42:34.640 --> 42:37.996
He wants to rid the world

42:38.200 --> 42:40.509
Of laughter

42:40.680 --> 42:41.680
Forever

42:41.840 --> 42:42.840
And ever

42:43.000 --> 42:44.035
We will defeat him

42:44.200 --> 42:47.476
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

42:49.160 --> 42:54.154
Poopypants

43:00.320 --> 43:01.833
Captain?
You forgetting something?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.355
Oh, look at that.
They came off again.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.554
Hey there, kiddo.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.278
First day for Professor P.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.391
Can you tell me where
the lunch is consumed?

43:13.200 --> 43:14.553
What's going
on with your face?

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
Are you choking?

43:15.880 --> 43:17.029
Do you need to sneeze?

43:18.480 --> 43:19.833
I see, I see.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.992
Got a case of
the giggles, huh? That's fun.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.794
Well, I've got
just the remedy for that.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.077
In the cage. Now!
Why?

43:29.240 --> 43:30.832
Because I hate
laughter and children...

43:31.040 --> 43:33.076
and I've got a cage
in a briefcase!

43:34.360 --> 43:36.874
Okay, well, have a nice day.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.871
Now what's for lunch?

43:44.360 --> 43:46.715
Excuse me, could you explain
to me why this is funny?

43:46.880 --> 43:48.711
You! Why is everyone laughing?

43:49.040 --> 43:52.555
Uh, you're asking
the wrong dude.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.753
"Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of...

43:56.920 --> 43:58.751
"Professor Poopypants."

44:02.760 --> 44:04.176
Oh, What's happening?

44:04.200 --> 44:05.918
I'm hyperventilating.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.269
Esteemed members

44:07.400 --> 44:09.436
of the Nobel
Prize Committee...

44:09.600 --> 44:11.670
it is with great pride...

44:11.840 --> 44:13.512
that I present to you...

44:13.680 --> 44:17.389
the Sizerator 2000!

44:17.520 --> 44:18.589
Ooh.
Oh.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.712
Behold, we can smallify.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.354
No more traffic jams.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.750
And conversely, largify.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.036
Look at how big
this hot dog is.

44:36.600 --> 44:40.309
Going to need a lot of mustard
for this frankfurter!

44:42.080 --> 44:45.629
The Nobel Peace Prize
in Inventing Stuff goes to...

44:46.040 --> 44:47.075
um,

44:47.160 --> 44:48.160
Professor...

44:50.480 --> 44:52.118
Is that really your name?

44:52.280 --> 44:54.396
It's not, like,
some kind of joke?

44:54.560 --> 44:56.437
No. It's not, like, a joke.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.433
It's a traditional name
in New Swissland.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.076
Am I pronouncing it right?

45:02.240 --> 45:04.151
Poopypants?

45:04.280 --> 45:07.317
More or less. Except
the emphasis is on the "poop."

45:09.000 --> 45:10.399
Why are you laughing?

45:10.600 --> 45:13.478
I've invented a shrinking
and enlarging ray!

45:13.640 --> 45:14.914
I should be famous!

45:15.080 --> 45:18.470
I should be dating models
twice my size...

45:18.640 --> 45:20.596
and doing
the talk show circuit!

45:20.760 --> 45:23.149
I should be protecting
baby seals as a cause...

45:23.360 --> 45:25.920
that I say I care about,
but not really!

45:26.080 --> 45:28.150
This guy is too much!

45:32.480 --> 45:33.993
Stop! Stop laughing!

45:34.160 --> 45:35.195
No, stop it!
Okay.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.352
Phew! Oh...

45:37.480 --> 45:39.630
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.319
Here. Take the award.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.438
It's really fun
to say Poopypants.

45:46.800 --> 45:49.678
You keep your stupid award!
I don't want it anymore.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.995
Oh, and one more thing...

45:56.360 --> 45:58.430
On behalf
of the Nobel Prize committee,

45:58.520 --> 46:00.112
please accept our apology.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.999
And could you change me
back now please?

46:03.160 --> 46:04.336
Why don't you go on and invent

46:04.360 --> 46:06.032
your own shrinking
and enlarging ray...

46:06.240 --> 46:08.470
if you think you're so smart?

46:13.400 --> 46:15.675
How much of that was out loud?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.354
Extra! Extra!
Get our latest issue!

46:18.520 --> 46:21.353
Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot

46:21.480 --> 46:23.471
of Professor Poopypants.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.198
Oh, no.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.234
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.394
Hmm. How many A's
are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"

46:32.600 --> 46:34.556
What?
I'll just go with 11.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.676
Enjoying your
first day, professor?

46:36.840 --> 46:38.717
The complete
opposite, actually.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.189
Look at what these
little monsters have created!

46:41.920 --> 46:45.879
We must lock them up,
probably, like, forever!

46:46.080 --> 46:47.080
Hmm.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.353
Oh, my.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.839
This is not a comic.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.516
This is a history book.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.715
What?

46:54.840 --> 46:57.035
And as such, it should be
taught in every classroom.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.553
And you yourself
must teach it...

46:58.720 --> 47:01.757
because that is
how good it is.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.360
I don't understand.
I thought, like,

47:03.400 --> 47:05.072
we'd be on the same page here.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.075
What page is that?
I'm on page 9, here.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.240
It's fantastic.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.400
Look, look.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.936
It's about
this evil science teacher...

47:11.960 --> 47:13.951
who looks a lot like you,
by the way.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.236
And he wanted to
rid the world of laughter...

47:16.400 --> 47:17.960
but he couldn't figure out
how to do it.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.835
Even worse, it seemed like
everywhere he went,

47:20.920 --> 47:22.876
people were having fun
and laughing.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.591
It just was infuriating.

47:25.960 --> 47:29.111
But then, he discovered
someone who wasn't.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.039
Why is it funny?

47:32.440 --> 47:34.795
Anti-Humor Boy!

47:36.600 --> 47:38.556
And then the professor says,
"Very interesting."

47:39.000 --> 47:40.399
That's my voice for him.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.471
Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.756
That's no Anti-Humor Boy.

47:44.960 --> 47:48.589
That's the suck up from class.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.431
Very interesting.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.796
You boys
don't even realize it...

47:54.960 --> 47:57.679
but your silly comic book
just helped me figure out...

47:57.840 --> 48:00.957
how to wipe out laughter
on the... Oof!

48:01.160 --> 48:02.513
Out of the road, bozo!

48:02.680 --> 48:03.880
Hey, watch where you're going!

48:03.960 --> 48:05.632
You just hit
Professor Poopypants.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.438
Poopypants?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.112
That's not funny!
That's not funny!

48:09.320 --> 48:11.072
Ever heard
of the sidewalk?

48:11.280 --> 48:14.431
Oh, if I had insurance,
you'd be in... Ow!

48:15.120 --> 48:17.315
I'll admit that
was surprising.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.520
Wow.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.636
That actually
worked out for once.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.313
Good job, Captain Underpants.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.152
At your service, sidekicks.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.912
Now where was I?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.309
We should probably
get back to class, huh?

48:28.480 --> 48:30.311
Yeah, we probably should.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.776
Excuse me. Pardon me.
If you could just...

48:33.800 --> 48:34.840
Watch your feet.
Excuse me.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.279
Sorry. Thank you.
Oh, hey, Todd.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.278
Now, let me ask you something.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.670
If you could
control your principal...

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
what would you do?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.719
Shh.
It's starting. It's starting.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.216
I just wanna
make sure you apply

49:37.240 --> 49:38.878
the extra credit
to next semester.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.230
I won't be needing it
this semester, of course.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.400
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.776
Whatever floats
your boat, Melvin.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.994
Excuse me?

49:45.160 --> 49:46.832
Can I please get
an ice cream sandwich?

49:47.040 --> 49:50.476
Yeah, scram, okay?
We're closed for Ebola.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.477
Okay, just a quick check

49:54.560 --> 49:56.152
to make sure
that we're connected.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.151
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
We're sure that's safe?

50:02.080 --> 50:04.913
And now,
some classic funny bloopers!

50:07.080 --> 50:09.355
Ah. That's a good one.
Oh, this one's my favorite.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.036
I'm sorry.
Why are you showing me this?

50:12.160 --> 50:13.360
Ow.

50:14.440 --> 50:15.759
Come on, that was funny!

50:15.840 --> 50:17.990
That child walked
right into that rake.

50:18.440 --> 50:21.079
I'm bored! What else is on?

50:21.240 --> 50:24.869
Fascinating.
Computer, scan.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.719
I don't believe it.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
You know, I suspected

50:28.960 --> 50:31.394
something smaller than normal,
but this...

50:31.880 --> 50:33.711
This.
What? What is it?

50:33.920 --> 50:37.117
I can't find it.
Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus!

50:37.440 --> 50:38.589
You don't have one!

50:41.640 --> 50:43.232
I don't get it.
Exactly.

50:43.400 --> 50:47.791
You have no sense of humor
like a chair or a supermodel.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.589
Melvin, with your brain
and my brain together...

50:51.760 --> 50:54.115
we can finally
wipe out laughter

50:54.200 --> 50:56.395
for once and for all!

50:57.640 --> 51:01.110
So George and Harold
want a supervillain...

51:01.480 --> 51:05.632
well, ask
and ye shall receive!

51:07.400 --> 51:09.072
I hereby declare...

51:09.240 --> 51:11.310
the Jerome Horwitz
art program...

51:12.840 --> 51:14.478
reinstated!

51:18.600 --> 51:19.669
Oh...

51:19.760 --> 51:20.988
After you, sir.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.512
Ooh, what if we...
I'm already on it.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.159
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

51:40.080 --> 51:41.911
Come on, Captain, draw!

51:42.000 --> 51:44.195
Move your hand
in the shape of a person!

51:44.360 --> 51:46.157
Why does it look
like a chicken?

51:46.320 --> 51:48.436
This whole visual
storytelling thing is hard!

51:48.520 --> 51:49.520
Oh, that's good.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.033
Here, these need words.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.509
Hey, sidekicks...

51:53.160 --> 51:54.513
why are we doing this again?

51:54.680 --> 51:56.875
Well, we're making
school fun again.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.190
You know, "free the children."

51:59.360 --> 52:01.176
Hey, hey! What if we put
this panel right here?

52:01.200 --> 52:02.200
Oh, yes! Yes, yes.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.038
Ah, yes. Of course.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.360
Fun.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.555
On it!

52:06.640 --> 52:07.640
Ha-ha!

52:14.480 --> 52:15.480
Uh...

52:15.680 --> 52:17.033
Where'd everybody go?

52:23.040 --> 52:25.031
Where did this even come from?

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
Hey!

52:26.240 --> 52:27.800
Oh, hey, sidekicks.
Glad you could join.

52:27.880 --> 52:29.074
How did you even do this?

52:29.160 --> 52:30.696
I thought you said
you were looking after the...

52:30.720 --> 52:32.176
Oh, my goodness!
Is that a Ferris wheel?

52:32.200 --> 52:33.553
Well, of course it is!

52:33.640 --> 52:35.710
It came
with the carnival I ordered.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.839
This cotton candy
makes me feel powerful!

52:41.840 --> 52:43.353
Hey, uh,
where are all the teachers?

52:43.520 --> 52:44.555
Detention.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.035
They have a real
attitude problem.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.231
Sure beats
having Krupp around!

52:49.400 --> 52:52.710
Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally
lose his mind if he saw this.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.393
Step right up!

52:54.560 --> 52:56.994
Who'll be the first
to dunk the principal?

52:57.080 --> 52:58.080
No!

52:59.200 --> 53:00.838
I'm drowning!

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
Tra-la...

53:03.520 --> 53:05.056
All right, that's enough.
Recess is over.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.115
Ah, come on!

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
Just one more ride!
Whoa!

53:08.120 --> 53:09.917
Hey, watch it!
What is this, a carnival?

53:10.080 --> 53:11.672
I hate carnivals!

53:11.840 --> 53:13.956
Oh, this looks fun!
How do we play?

53:15.040 --> 53:16.439
Hold your fire!

53:17.960 --> 53:18.960
What is happening?

53:19.120 --> 53:20.120
Who wants ice cream?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.599
Ice cream!

53:21.800 --> 53:23.840
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep this up forever.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.871
We have to! We'll just
take shifts watching him.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.360
I'll take today.
You take tonight.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.748
Sugar!

53:30.960 --> 53:31.960
Sugar!

53:33.960 --> 53:35.951
Harold, I really
want some sugar.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.394
Me too.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.473
We made the wrong choice!

53:40.640 --> 53:42.471
This did not solve anything!

53:42.640 --> 53:44.000
Hey, sidekicks!

53:44.480 --> 53:45.959
Check this out!

53:46.880 --> 53:48.757
Geronimo!

53:48.920 --> 53:49.920
No!

53:53.800 --> 53:55.153
This way!

53:55.320 --> 53:57.151
Field trip, anyone?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.235
No, no, no!

54:00.960 --> 54:03.315
Nothing's more fun than fire!

54:03.480 --> 54:04.993
Except being on...

54:06.320 --> 54:07.673
Fire!

54:10.240 --> 54:11.309
What is happening?

54:12.680 --> 54:14.511
Tra-la-laaaa!

54:20.000 --> 54:22.355
Now, this is
how you run a school!

54:24.960 --> 54:26.837
Free the children!

54:29.640 --> 54:30.640
Wait a minute.

54:33.840 --> 54:34.840
What the...

54:36.680 --> 54:37.829
How did this...

54:40.680 --> 54:42.159
I don't understand.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.198
Help!
What the...

54:46.440 --> 54:47.714
You...

54:48.440 --> 54:50.192
You two.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.192
Your friendship...

54:53.960 --> 54:57.839
is no more.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
What?

55:46.400 --> 55:47.400
George!

55:47.720 --> 55:48.755
Harold!

55:50.040 --> 55:52.429
Harold! Come back!

55:52.600 --> 55:55.751
George, I'm right here!
I'm right here!

55:55.920 --> 55:59.230
Oh, no! No, no!
Don't leave me!

55:59.400 --> 56:01.550
I won't! I won't, George!

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
Harold!

56:02.760 --> 56:04.273
No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!

56:04.440 --> 56:08.069
George!

56:29.320 --> 56:32.073
This thing is amazing,
Professor P.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.315
You could probably solve

56:33.440 --> 56:35.040
world hunger
with an invention like this.

56:35.160 --> 56:37.879
Pass!
More importantly...

56:38.160 --> 56:39.752
how do I look?

56:39.920 --> 56:42.639
Just like you do
in this comic!

56:42.800 --> 56:44.791
Good! Now,
hands off the merchandise,

56:44.920 --> 56:46.831
and go fetch
your little toilet, okay?

56:48.160 --> 56:49.912
I call it "The Turbo..."

56:50.080 --> 56:52.435
Yeah, yeah. Couple of
gold stars for you, kiddo.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.993
Let the Poopageddon begin!

56:59.960 --> 57:01.837
Whoo-ee!

57:06.280 --> 57:09.158
What?
Oh, you've gotta be joking me!

57:09.520 --> 57:13.593
Poopypants has no gas!
You can't write this stuff.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.113
Where would
a burgeoning villain

57:16.200 --> 57:17.792
find unlimited power?

57:17.960 --> 57:20.679
True power comes from within.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.159
No, it doesn't, Melvin!

57:22.320 --> 57:23.320
That's on stupid posters!

57:23.360 --> 57:24.360
Okay.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.516
It comes
from enormous energy sources!

57:26.640 --> 57:27.868
A nuclear waste dump.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.040
I see where you're going.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.678
A poisonous chemical factory.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.475
Or perhaps
a place even more toxic!

57:37.800 --> 57:39.153
Whoo!
These leftovers got a kick.

57:41.720 --> 57:43.995
Oh, it's a powerful smell.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.519
Back in business, baby!

57:55.040 --> 57:57.713
Memorize these elements...

57:57.880 --> 57:59.996
Oxygen. Beryllium.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.031
Boringillium.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.713
Lameium.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.154
Snoronium.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.516
Excuse me, everybody,
there's a giant...

58:17.720 --> 58:19.216
Do not interrupt
while I'm reading

58:19.240 --> 58:20.878
monotone from my textbook!

58:21.040 --> 58:23.076
But the toilet!

58:23.240 --> 58:24.240
Ugh.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.197
Just go.

58:27.600 --> 58:28.600
Harold?

58:29.440 --> 58:30.440
George?

58:49.600 --> 58:51.431
Students and faculty

58:51.560 --> 58:54.552
of Jerome Horwitz
Elementary...

58:54.960 --> 59:00.114
the world, as you know it,
is about to go extinct.

59:00.280 --> 59:04.034
And a new world order
is about to rise!

59:04.200 --> 59:05.713
One that is,
you know, honestly

59:05.800 --> 59:07.472
pretty similar
to the old world order...

59:07.640 --> 59:10.950
except for one tiny detail...

59:13.400 --> 59:14.469
Melvin?

59:14.640 --> 59:16.278
Comin' atcha!

59:16.440 --> 59:18.795
Powered by
Melvin's unique neurology...

59:18.960 --> 59:23.112
I will successfully disable
the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus...

59:23.280 --> 59:27.273
of every single child at
Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

59:27.440 --> 59:31.149
For I, Professor Poopypants...

59:33.000 --> 59:34.592
Yeah, it's a funny name.

59:35.480 --> 59:38.631
It just makes you
laugh and laugh, right?

59:41.320 --> 59:42.320
Get down!

59:45.760 --> 59:47.830
Still give you
the chuckles now?

59:47.960 --> 59:49.393
Poopypants!

59:49.600 --> 59:50.999
I don't get it.

59:51.160 --> 59:52.229
Why is that funny?

59:52.440 --> 59:53.440
Perfect!

59:53.600 --> 59:56.512
Finally!
You're speaking my language!

59:56.680 --> 59:58.113
Oh, no. This is bad.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.435
This is seriously bad.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.590
I mean,
a world without laughter?

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.400
George, if he destroys
our sense of humor,

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.509
he destroys us!

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.353
Imagine how boring
our comics will be.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.957
Captain Underpants
and the Purchase

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.598
of the Sensible Beige Pants.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.992
Captain Underpants
Eats All of His Falafel.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.674
Captain Underpants
Watches Cement Dry.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.696
And would the creators of

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.837
this absolutely
hilarious comic book...

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.197
please come out, come out,
wherever you are!

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.032
You're next.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.192
Okay, we have to stop him.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.198
We've gotta find a way
to unplug Melvin.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400
Yeah.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.234
But how do we get to him
without Poopypants seeing us?

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.471
What are you two
doing together?

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.312
Are you in there?

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.988
Oh...
Maybe you're hiding here.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.636
Oh, sorry.
Are you stuck on hold?

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.230
Oh, totally hate
when that happens.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.549
Well, good luck with that.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.478
Now, where are
those two little...

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.750
Stand down, Poopypants!

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.069
What is happening?

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.753
I hope this works.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.433
Tra-la-laaa!

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.675
Ow! Ow!

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.856
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.233
Ow.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.831
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.752
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.029
Ha-ha!

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.753
Prepare to be vanquished...

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.273
and justice to be served

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.039
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.758
With a side order
of liberty...

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.629
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.274
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.595
you giant baby with a cape on!

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.119
Let's do this.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.271
Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.776
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800
And expensive.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.136
...that we can only show it
using a technology known as...

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.276
Flip-O-Rama!

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.555
Take it away, Harold.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.216
Okay,
first Professor Poopypants

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.416
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.714
Foot! Foot! Ow!

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.536
Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.896
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.136
And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.912
Oh, no!

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080
Darn.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.071
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.073
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.296
Wait, what?
Why are you always

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.576
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.896
What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.216
I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.976
- it just didn't happen!
- Well, so what?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.639
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.791
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.896
Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.056
- You sure?
- Yep, positive.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080
Thank you.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.496
- Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
- Quiet five, quiet five.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.801
...but George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.896
So, they
shot themselves to the top

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.353
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.829
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.758
And then...
And then...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And then...

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.598
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.875
I ran outta paper.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.716
Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880
We gotta stop Poopypants!

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.713
Professor Poopypants!

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.030
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.112
You are just so annoying!

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.272
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.469
you could distract me...

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.712
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.836
I'm not naked!

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.198
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.513
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.069
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.549
I mean, that was just wrong.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.554
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is, Professor P...

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.073
you have probably, like,

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.991
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.520
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.312
Oh, that would be so cool!

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.072
Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.909
Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.868
Yeah! I would be
Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.216
Yeah, sure. You're a knight.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.240
This is so good!

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.760
I wanna change mine.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.275
I'd be
Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.668
Stinkelsberg.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.669
Yeah, those are all
really silly names,

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.080
but there's
nothing funny about...

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.839
Professor
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.354
Poopypants Esquire!

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.755
Sir, are you saying
your full name is...

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.794
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein
Poopypants Esquire?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880
Uh-huh.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.393
Stop it! Stop laughing!

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.357
Come on! Listen, your problem

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.078
isn't that people
laugh at you.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.595
Your problem is that
you can't laugh at yourself.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.274
Oh, really, Oprah?
Is that my problem?

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.596
Well, your problem is this...

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.629
No!

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.314
Oh, I hope
you enjoyed your years

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.470
of laughter and merriment...

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.269
because they're about
to come to an end.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.993
Do you find anything funny
about me now?

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.234
You mean,
other than your name?

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.951
Yes! Other than that!

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.116
And your hair?

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200
What?

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.838
My hair's cool, I thought.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.672
Are you kidding me?

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.638
That's almost as funny as
my hair back in kindygarten!

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.358
Remember that afro?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.591
No!
No, this can't be happening!

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.671
Computer, activate brain scan.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.113
Let's see. The frontal lobes
look big and healthy.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.032
The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.839
looks all shrimpy,
so, what gives?

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520
It can't be!

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.796
Their
Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses,

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.359
they're enormous!

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.995
I need more power.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.950
Anything strike you
as funny now?

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.556
I'm sure
we can think of something!

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.030
George, I can't smile anymore.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.838
No! Harold!

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.952
One down, und one to go.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.154
Harold.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.030
Harold. Harold,
can you hear me?

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.072
Harold!

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.558
George! George, is that you?

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720
Right here, buddy.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.157
What's happening?
We're shrinking!

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.736
Now, if we don't laugh
at something soon,

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.909
we may never laugh again.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.196
Oh, no! What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.396
Well, we have to think
of something funny, okay?

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.511
Okay, yeah, sure.
Something funny.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920
Anything?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.319
No, I got nothing.
Me neither.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.640
More shrinkage!

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.594
Okay, okay.
What did we use to find funny?

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.876
Mostly potty humor. Poop,
vomit, that kind of thing.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.874
Really? Ugh. That is, like,
the lowest form of comedy.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.838
Don't you say that, Harold!
Don't you leave me!

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.176
Attention everyone!

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.112
Poopypants here with a little
update on the Poopageddon.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.590
Due to the success
of my plan thus far...

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.591
I've decided
to wipe out laughter

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.432
on the entire planet.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.352
After that, you know,
I'll probably

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.520
move on to other planets...

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600
Jupiter, Mars...

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.518
can't forget Uranus!

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.112
Wait. Did he just say...

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.111
Your anus.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280
I know!

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.560
Uranus!

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.438
Yeah, and once I'm through
with the gas giants...

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.556
I figure I'll go
after the other galaxies...

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.755
What?

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.558
It feels so good to laugh!

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.832
No, stop it! Stop laughing!
You're ruining everything!

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.560
Yikes!
Extra credit or survival?

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.159
Extra credit or survival?

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.151
I choose survival!

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840
Uh-oh!

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.828
Oh, yeah!

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880
Wow!

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.151
No, how could this
be happening?

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:42.354
Never underestimate

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.510
the power of laughter,
Poopypants!

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.790
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.880
Oh!

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.153
Ah! Whoa!

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.550
Harold! Harold, we did it!

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.399
Harold?

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.953
I think I bruised a rib.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.991
Because I've never laughed
so hard in my life!

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.997
Oh, we'll see who's laughing
once I shrink you down...

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.196
where you will live
in my pocket forever...

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:23.590
amongst my
cherry-flavored lip balm...

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.711
my butterscotch-flavored
lip balm...

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800
Oh, neato!

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.711
...my mint-flavored
lip balm...

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.031
my extra-moisturized
SPF lip balm...

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.919
and all of my lip balms!

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.551
Why does one person have
so much lip balm?

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720
Help!
Help!

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.671
Please, anyone! Help!

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.439
Help!

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.631
Ooh, I hope you can find
tiny enough pens...

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.870
to make your small,
little comic books with...

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.031
'cause you're about to
get smallified!

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.876
Tra-la-laa!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.632
I feel...

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.669
awesome!

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.875
No way!

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.439
He has real superpowers!

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.473
Oh, that is an obvious twist
that I did not see coming...

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.596
despite my many years
of comic book studies!

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.433
I have come to save the day!

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.749
Yay!

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.319
Yeah, and I've come
to ruin it!

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.760
So back off, buddy!

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.520
Ha-ha!

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.999
Ew, that's gross!

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.718
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.480
Monday! Tuesday!
Wednesday! Thursday!

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.353
Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.398
I am so glad that we gave him
that superpower!

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.028
My Sizerator!

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.920
Well, it's mine now!

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.151
Alas!

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.472
The final failure
for Professor Poopypants.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.153
Hmm. What does this button do?

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.236
Oh...

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.396
Well, hello down there!

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.560
No!

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.840
Must be holding it backwards.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.079
Yup. That was it.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.077
Wow. He is super dumb.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.834
I can't reach.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.395
Time to take you down
once and for all, Poopypants!

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.198
Buzz off!

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.235
Captain Underpants!

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.080
Fly over here
so we can make you big again!

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.309
Crackerjack idea.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200
George, just don't...

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.390
No!

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.600
Ha-ha!

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.916
Give him a big hand
for that one, everybody!

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.594
Get him.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.755
Whoops.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.037
Look what I've got.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:45.994
A tiny school

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.640
filled with tiny children...

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.555
and their tiny teachers
whose tiny salaries...

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.756
reflect their size and also...

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.718
the value society puts
on education.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.588
I'll take that!

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.591
Oh! Then I'll take that!

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.119
Ow! Did you just slap me?

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.032
Yes, I did.
And you deserved it.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.839
No, I didn't! Your hand
is huge! That hurt a lot!

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.149
Give it back, it's mine!

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.389
No! Hands off!

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.232
No fair! No backsies!
Give it to me!

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.674
Would you just give me that?

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.359
Now look
what you've done!

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
Give it!

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.438
George!

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080
Gotcha!

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.392
Yeah, that's more like it!

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.154
Nice work, sidekicks!

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.958
I'll just put this back down
right here.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.400
No, no, no!
Captain Underpants...

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.391
There we go. Back to normal...

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.959
like it never happened.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.277
Oh, no, where'd he go?

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.998
You'll never catch me!

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.310
You can't stop
Professor Poopypants!

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.353
Get back here!
I can't reach!

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.920
Get him, Captain Underpants!

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.951
A bee!
Get away from me!

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.236
I'm free!

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.640
What? What the...
Why would you do that?

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.512
You just let
the bad guy get away!

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.877
Come on, guys. Pretty sure
the bee wasn't the bad guy.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.279
What the heck happened here?

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.560
You're welcome, peace keeper!

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.159
Would you keep it down?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.909
Did not see that coming!
Take that, Doctor Diaper!

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.113
I can't believe we made him.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.350
And he's even dumber
in real life.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.429
Oh! Look! Little dolphins!

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.437
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.999
I think we do.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.479
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.879
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.031
But, you know, George...

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.509
bringing back Krupp
permanently...

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.788
we'll never be
in the same class again.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.149
Yeah, I know.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.548
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.232
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.755
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.354
Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.595
Let's do a blood oath.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.016
But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.075
Pinky swear?

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240
No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.318
Oh, got it!

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.073
Oh, no. What? No!

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.514
That's not sanitary.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.477
Can't we just do
a verbal declaration

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.754
of friendship or something?

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.393
Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.119
I haven't really
prepared anything, but...

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.118
I, Harold...

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.759
hereby declare George

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.469
as my best friend,
permanently, forever.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.632
And I, George, accept
the permanent rights...

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.068
that Harold has given me

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.071
to be
his best friend forever...

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.708
and the constitution
of friends...

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880
America, friendship.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.256
And the United States
of America.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.776
Land and the United States.
Good, okay, yeah.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.080
It's done. All right, cool.
Phew.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.958
What a relief.
Yeah, no kidding.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.480
I mean,
why were we even worried...

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.670
about that whole classroom
thing in the first place?

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.840
You know, I don't know.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.274
We were younger then.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.629
Clearly, we have grown.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800
Clearly, we have.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160
Chums!

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.395
Thank you for chronicling

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.755
my surprisingly
grounded biography.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.514
The truth is a slippery thing.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.908
And you nailed it.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.350
Now it is time to fly again!

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.397
Farewell, my dear sidekicks.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.118
Goodbye, Captain Underpants.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.349
Goodbye.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.679
George! Harold!

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.416
What am I doing in your
tree house again?

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.952
You boys are in big trouble!

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.753
I don't know how big yet...

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.360
Why does this
keep happening?

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.231
Where are my clothes?
Where are they?

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.949
I don't get it.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.229
Why is Krupp so angry

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.231
and Captain Underpants
so happy?

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.359
Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.034
You know, he had friends.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.552
We could fix that.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.433
Yeah, you know, we could.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.913
So that's how we came

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.479
to pull the rarest prank
of all...

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.233
The prank...

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.039
for good.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.240
Huh?

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.436
"Do you want to go a date?"

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.235
A date?

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.394
"Love, Edith."

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.754
"Principal Krupp."

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
Oh!

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.114
Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.998
Edith, the lunch lady.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.479
Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.552
No! What?
That's none of your business!

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.957
But, if you must know...

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.839
yeah, I actually do.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.038
By the way,
I was tidying up my office...

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.430
and I believe
these belong to you...

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.675
Our comics?

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.200
Did you just pull that out
of the garbage can?

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.838
Well, I read them...

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.016
and considering
they're completely

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.075
implausible, juvenile...

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.196
and filled with
the lowest form of wit...

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.719
potty humor...

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.598
they're actually pretty funny.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.393
See ya later!

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.276
Well, how about that...

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.952
That's a good one.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.794
You know, it feels good to do
something nice for Mr. Krupp.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.791
Yeah, you know what? It does.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.976
Promise we'll never
do it again.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.035
Promise.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120
Oh, my!

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.515
I've never been to

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.318
such a fancy restaurant
before.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.917
Well, I had to go all out
for m'lady.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.152
Okay, if you say so,
my man!

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.795
Once again,
that brings our story

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.199
to its happy conclusion.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.480
I think there's some valuable
life lessons in there...

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520
somewhere.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600
What the?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.159
Eat 'em up, yum, yum!

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.278
You gotta be kidding me! No!

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.317
Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.754
Oh, no!

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.073
Waiter! Check please!

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.592
Principal Krupp!

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760
Oh, no!

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.354
Help!

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080
Hang on, sidekicks!

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280
I don't get it!

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.958
I really thought
breaking that ring

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.678
would get rid of his powers!

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.632
Yeah, well, here we go again!

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.671
Tra-la-laa!

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.995
Are you worried
about impending doom?

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.714
Those evil villains
got you filled with gloom

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.032
But don't you fear,
there's a hero in the sky

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.037
The sky, the sky

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.909
It's not a bird

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.399
And it's not a plane

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.514
And it's not
an egg salad sandwich

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.831
It's the waistband warrior

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.791
Hear his mighty battle cry!

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.393
Tra-la-laa!

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.033
Hey, watch out, crime!

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.793
It's wedgie-power time

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.920
Na, na, na, na, na

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.235
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.630
Faster than
a speeding waistband!

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.712
He's bustin' down doors

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.518
While wearing
just his drawers

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680
Na, na, na, na, na

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.711
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.711
More powerful
than boxer shorts.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.800
His name is

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.552
Under, Under, Underpants

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.680
I'm sayin'

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.472
Under, Under, Underpants

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.039
Oh, yeah,
by some unlikely chance

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.720
Captain Underpants
is his name

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.876
Tra-la-laa!

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.468
Snap your fingers
and he'll be right there

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.028
That freaky, bald dude
in his underwear

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.670
He'll drop those trousers and
he'll fight to save the day

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.392
The day, the day

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.988
Oh, there he goes
in his dashing cape

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.080
Here he comes
in his tighty-whities

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.311
All the bad guys
soil themselves

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.311
Every time they hear him say

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.833
Tra-la-laa!

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.832
Hey, who's that hunk?

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.318
Is that cotton pre-shrunk?

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400
Na, na, na, na, na

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.835
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.751
It's time to fly again!

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.991
Suspend your disbelief

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.911
He'll save the world
in his briefs

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:49.910
Na, na, na, na, na

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.275
Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.873
To the sky!

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.160
Under, Under, Underpants

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.200
I'm sayin'

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.032
Under, Under, Underpants

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.519
Check out
that superhero stance

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.830
Captain Underpants is his name

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.757
Stand down, Poopypants!

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880
Oh...

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.518
Under, Under, Underpants

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600
He's Captain

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.512
Under, Under, Underpants

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.953
Yeah, by some
crazy circumstance

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.349
Captain Underpants
is his name

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.635
Tra-tra-tra... Tra-la-laa!

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.109
Under, Under, Underpants

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.632
Under, Under, Underpants

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280
Wait.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440
No way!

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.836
She's been on hold for,
like, the whole movie.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.633
Come on, come on.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.555
Hello.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.472
Thank you for holding.
How can I help...

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.030
No!

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.756
Right from the start
couldn't pull us apart

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840
It just works

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.832
Nobody else ever
gets me as well on this earth

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.832
Like Rock and Roll
My shows and tellies

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.520
Mac and cheese
PBs and jellies

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.232
Some things
are better together

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.759
And that's you and me

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.748
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.910
Man, I love you

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.194
You're my brother from another

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.311
Another mother

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.593
You are my favorite

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.274
I'm not ashamed to admit

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.749
'Cause I do
Dude, I do

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.599
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.796
Man, I love you

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.588
You're my homie

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.030
No one knows me
Like you know me

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.360
Like the sun and the moon

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.874
All the best things
come in twos

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.959
What would I do
without a friend like you?

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.473
What, what, what, what

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.312
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.231
Without a friend like you

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.793
What, what, what, what

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.791
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.233
Without a friend like you

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.392
Laugh till we cry when we're
passing the time away

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.990
Even our fights always end
with a smile on our face

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.552
Like black and white keys
On a Wurli

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.399
Sounds just right
and work in harmony

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.999
Some things
are better together

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.479
And that's you and me

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.674
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.751
Man, I love you

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.999
You're my brother from another

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.196
Another mother

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.433
You are my favorite

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.080
I'm not ashamed to admit

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.754
'Cause I do
Dude, I do

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.434
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.516
Man, I love you

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.428
You're my homie

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.751
No one knows me
like you know me

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.193
Like the sun and the moon

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.669
All the best things
Come in twos

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:59.429
What would I do
without a friend like you?

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.039
What, what, what, what

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.190
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.032
Without a friend like you

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.439
What, what, what, what

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.636
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.792
Without a friend like you

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.951
Without a friend like you

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.759
With... With...
Without a friend like you

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.155
What would I do?

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.631
Without a friend like you

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.557

No one knows me
Like you know me

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.913
You are my favorite

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.594
I'm not ashamed to admit

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.194
'Cause I do
Dude, I do

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.919
Dude, I love you
Bro, I love you

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.991
Man, I love you

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.989
Got my back
I got your back

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.958
Like chiropractors

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.713
Like the sun and the moon

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.155
All the best things
come in twos

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.074
What would I do
without a friend like you?

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.434
What, what, what, what

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.715
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.597
Without a friend like you

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.829
What, what, what, what

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.070
What would I do?
What would I do?

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.276
Without a friend like you

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480
Give me a beat.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.954
Saturday, Saturday...

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.355
I love Saturday

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.471
Where everything is possible

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.955
Nothing stands in our way

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.034
Don't have to be responsible

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.999
Everywhere we go

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.159
Nobody says, "No"

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.357
Yeah, finally we're free

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.793
We got nowhere we need to be

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.639
On Saturday, Saturday

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.836
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.275
I think it's time for a break

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.356
We'll get away
Get away, eh, eh, eh...

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.750
We can go
coloring the world together

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.792
We can make a story
that'll last forever

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.270
On Saturday,
Saturday, eh, eh, eh

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.072
Hey...

The perfect day

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760
Saturday

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.354
There's one day every week

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.118
No alarm's gonna wake me up

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.789
Stay in bed and sleep

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.791
Or maybe watch TV too much

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:50.231
Lazing all day long

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.198
No one says it's wrong

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.999
No, finally we're free

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.638
We got nowhere we need to be

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.559
On Saturday, Saturday

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.551
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.074
I think it's time for a break

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.310
We'll get away
Get away, eh, eh, eh

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.512

We can make a story
that'll last forever

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.076
On Saturday,
Saturday, eh, eh, eh

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.037
Hey...

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.592
The perfect day

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.638
On Saturday

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.237
Take your bag
and leave your house

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.271
Don't need no TV
to be entertained

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.554
We are the show

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.677
Come now and play it subtle
Bring back all that we know

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.356
Our songs the only thing
that's playing on the radio

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.315
On Saturday, Saturday

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.557
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.995
I think it's time for a break

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.275
We'll get away, get away

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.557
The perfect day

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.316
The perfect day

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.870
We got nowhere we need to be

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.918
On Saturday, Saturday

01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:31.515
