we'd make the rounds
and introduce you
to all the tenants.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.146

-I'm the groundskeeper
slash superintendent.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.565

-Is that what it is?
-No.

Yeah, like,
I buy vintage clothes
and then I sell them.

Unless I really like them.
Then I keep 'em for myself.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.163
All right, go ahead.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.541
Twist the new valve,
open it up.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.921
-[valve handle squeaks]
-All right, now try the water.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.092
[man] There you go!

16:50.175 --> 16:51.635
See?

16:51.719 --> 16:54.346
You really do work better alone.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.598
Pretty much.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.643
Ah, it's an old building.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.187
Your father renovated it.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.021
It still has its quirks.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.527
Do you know that James Dean
lived up on the third floor?

17:08.610 --> 17:10.237
For real?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.030
No, I'm just fucking with ya.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.618
Fuck you.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.162
It's okay to ask for help...

17:20.247 --> 17:21.373
sometimes.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.423
[door opens, closes]

17:38.390 --> 17:42.269

-Whoa, Jesus, I thought
there was nobody here.

17:42.352 --> 17:42.811
-Hey, man, hey.
-Hey! Hey!

17:42.895 --> 17:44.646
Hey, wait! Whoa, whoa.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.231
Hey. Hey, Lucas, it's me.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.150
-Who the fuck are you?
-It's me. It's me.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.485
Who?

17:50.944 --> 17:51.653
You don't remember me?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.573
-Uncle Tommy?
-Yes!

17:54.656 --> 17:56.617
I thought you were gonna
kill me with that thing, man.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.994
-You should knock next time.
-I-- I just...

18:00.162 --> 18:01.163
[chuckles]

18:01.747 --> 18:02.998
It's me.
[chuckles]

18:03.081 --> 18:06.627
-[light music playing]
-[no audible dialogue]

18:22.267 --> 18:24.061
[Tommy] It's a nice
old building, you know.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.730
I mean, no rent control.
[knocking]

18:26.814 --> 18:27.564
-[man] Yo, come in.
-[Tommy] Hey, hey!

18:27.648 --> 18:30.025
Hey, there he is!

18:31.318 --> 18:33.529
-[grunts]
-[Tommy] How are ya?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.906
-How are ya?
-Captain. [chuckling]

18:35.989 --> 18:37.032
So...

18:38.283 --> 18:39.201
What's new, Tom?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.329
A lot.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.248
A whole lot of shaking going on.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.546
Sammy Stein, Luke.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.967
This is the best of the best
of property law.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.553
Ooh.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.137
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.682
-How's it going?
-[chuckling]

19:01.765 --> 19:04.434
Yeah, old Sammy here,

19:04.518 --> 19:07.396
he got me out of a jam or two
back in the day.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.191
-[Lucas] Yeah?
-Old IRS wanted to take
everything from me.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.320
The shirt off my back.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.406
-In fact, every shirt.
-Fuck the IRS.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.325
[men chuckling]

19:20.409 --> 19:21.577
[Tommy laughing]
He always says that.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.037
[Sammy grunts]

19:24.121 --> 19:25.622
So, I just got off the phone
with the legal team

19:25.706 --> 19:28.584
at Innovation Holdings,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.502
and the offer
is still on the table.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.130
Of course it is.
[chuckles]

19:33.213 --> 19:35.424
You should have seen me
selling these people.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.926
I was like fucking golden.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.761
[Sammy] All right,
so here's the contract.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.805
Now, I looked this over
and it's solid.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.932
I mean,
this is a really good deal.

19:44.808 --> 19:49.146
But all you need to do now
is you sign.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.693
You-- you wanted me
to sign it like right now?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.239
Why the hell else
you think we're here?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.577
You said you wanted
to sell, right?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.335
-[waves crashing]
-[seagulls cawing]

20:16.673 --> 20:18.300
[Kieffer] Hey, bro,
seriously, it doesn't matter

20:18.383 --> 20:21.470
if it's a dude, if it's a chick,
if it's some kind of animal,

20:21.553 --> 20:24.014
I don't know, just--
I just wanna see my bro
get his pee-pee touched.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.891
-Like, for real.
-[laughing]

20:25.974 --> 20:28.018
-You know, like...
-What are you even
talking about, bro?

20:28.101 --> 20:30.854
-Like, I just wanna
see you happy.
-[laughs]

20:30.938 --> 20:32.314
For real, you come to LA,
you're all like moody and shit.

20:32.397 --> 20:36.443
I don't know, like, I just--
I mean, for real, like...

20:36.526 --> 20:37.653
Like, whatever happened
with you and Juliet?

20:38.570 --> 20:41.990
He ended up calling.
He's like, "Good thing
I brought my Heelys,"

20:42.074 --> 20:43.867
and he just like slid away.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.495
Nothing, that's what happened.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.707
Yo, remember
she was dating Kev's dad
back in high school for a bit?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.459
What the--?
No, bro.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.877
That was a fucking rumor.
That's not true.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.714
No, no, no, dawg,
I definitely saw them
making out at a party once.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.007
Like, hard.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.387
Thanks for telling me, dude.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.306
Oh, shit, I'm...

21:06.390 --> 21:08.058
I thought you guys
were on a break.

21:11.186 --> 21:11.269
No.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.189
Fuck Reno.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.069
I wanna sell the place.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.905
But...

21:22.656 --> 21:24.700
I also...

21:25.784 --> 21:27.703
don't wanna go back to Reno.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.586
Then don't go back to Reno.
Damn, dude, I've been trying
to tell,

21:36.670 --> 21:40.173
like, Cosmo and all you boys
to move down here for years.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.010
What the hell would
we have done in LA?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.594
I don't know.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.388
What the fuck
you been doing in Reno?

21:51.768 --> 21:52.227
[Kieffer snickers]

21:55.981 --> 21:57.399
[machine beeps]

22:00.152 --> 22:01.319
Card declined.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.156
You have a credit card?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.033
Hey, Mom.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.245
[Lucas]<i> This probably</i>
<i>isn't true or anything,</i>

22:10.328 --> 22:13.248
but my mom had mentioned
there might be like,

22:13.331 --> 22:17.169
uh, an amount or something
I could get monthly
from the building.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.423
It's probably
not even the case, right?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.428
Is that what you really want,
kid?

22:26.511 --> 22:27.429
Money?

22:29.431 --> 22:31.391
-You wanna cash out
on your dad's place?
-Uh, you know, never mind.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.019
-Don't worry about it.
-No, Lucas, hold on.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.271
I can't do it right now because
I have a water heater to fix.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.107
But I'm happy
to chip you something.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.944
But will you please
just go introduce yourself

22:43.028 --> 22:44.946
to all the tenants first?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.490
You know,
like a decent human being?

22:48.784 --> 22:52.287
So be nice,
knock first and be polite.

22:54.956 --> 22:57.459
You're a pain in my ass,
but thank you.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.127

for this bullshit.

that's a big responsibility.

-Do you know how to do that?

I mean, you know,
manage an apartment?

23:35.914 --> 23:37.666
-Oh, qualifications?
-Qualifications.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.127
-You know, experience.
-For the building, like,
to run buildings?

-Right, like--
-No, I don't.

-Hi--
-Uh, can you please
just leave me alone?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.191
Have some eggs.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.818
They are good.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.528
Oh, no, I-- I'm good.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.697
I have to go
around the apartments today.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.198
You pig.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.032
Where's the papers?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.577
I don't speak English, so...

24:13.660 --> 24:15.912
Yeah, you just spoke English,
though.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.415
Oh, no, I-- I never
spoke English in my life.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.334
-Frank should come in
with you...
-Um...

24:21.418 --> 24:23.378
...because, you know,
I'm-- I'm not feeling ya.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.714
You know what,
I-- I agree with you.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.923
Oh, how about some chips?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.551
Make you strong.

-You come back
to see me, won't you?

-Okay, yeah.
-Yeah.

Ugh.

[tenant speaking in Spanish]

-Get out of here!
-[doors slamming]

Hello?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.043
Oh, hi.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.921
Sorry, I didn't think
anyone was home.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.131
No, I'm-- I'm home.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.342
-Yeah, sorry, sorry,
I'm being weird.
-Yeah, you are.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.553
I'm just going
around the apartment,

25:13.637 --> 25:16.056
introducing myself to everyone,

25:16.139 --> 25:20.352
and clearly I forgot it's you.

25:20.435 --> 25:20.977
-It's me.
-Yeah.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.270
-So, hello, again.
-Hi.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.940
Well, even though
we've already met,

25:25.023 --> 25:28.235
I am Miss Sophie.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.444
It's a pleasure.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.446
My God, that's so official.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.323
Give me a handshake.

The pleasure's all mine.

Lucas Varela at your service.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.622
You're Augusto's son?

25:43.875 --> 25:44.668
I can't believe that he's gone.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.965
Yeah, it's weird.
I feel like everybody knew him
except me.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.508
And you're just taking over
the place?

25:51.591 --> 25:54.803
No, no, I'm kind of like
watching over the place

25:54.886 --> 25:56.846
until we figure things out.

25:56.930 --> 25:57.973
Who's we?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.057
Mm... me.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.893
It's-- it's me.

26:01.977 --> 26:05.689
He, uh, kind of made me
like the head of his estate.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.610
God, that sounds so British.
Um...

26:10.694 --> 26:14.072
-It does.
-I don't know why he did that,
to be honest.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.951
Maybe it was his way
to show you he loved you.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.705
Yeah, I don't know about that.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.416
I think so.

26:28.586 --> 26:31.965
So, uh, Tony Hawk,
how's your hand?

26:32.048 --> 26:33.508
Maybe you can sign it
like in high school.

26:33.591 --> 26:37.679
But just like maybe
don't draw a dick on it.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.598
-Can't promise that.
-I'd rather you not.
[laughs]

26:40.682 --> 26:42.767
So, uh, are you like
an artist or something?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.853
-What is all this shit?
-Mm, kind of.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.940
I mean, I make things sometimes,
but my boyfriend, he's a DJ,

26:49.024 --> 26:49.733
so all the music stuff is his.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.736
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.364
I used to play in a band.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.576
-Like, back in high school.
-Really?

26:59.659 --> 27:02.454
I bet you guys
would get along really well.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.371
-Yeah?
-You know what?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.583
Gavin!
Gavin, baby, we have company.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.252
-Come say hi.
-[Gavin] I'm trying to sleep.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.046
What are you yelling about?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.965
-Hey, bro.
-What's up?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.759
[Gavin] Yeah, all right,
well, guess I'm up now.

27:18.636 --> 27:19.554
-Mwah.
-I love you, poopy.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.640
[Gavin] Mm, how do you guys
know each other?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.810
[Sophie] Uh, Lucas
is Mr. Varela's son.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.439
Mm, is that like a family friend
or something?

27:29.522 --> 27:32.525
No, Augusto the-- the landlord.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.569
Oh, shit.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.906
-Yeah.
-Oh, dude, I'm sorry, man.

27:37.989 --> 27:38.406
God, I feel terrible.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.617
That must be rough.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.203
No worries.
Appreciate that, though.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.081
Yeah, I-- I didn't
put it together.

27:46.164 --> 27:49.125
I've been texting him
and he hasn't hit me back
about the garbage disposal.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.961
It makes sense now.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.130
By the way, could you tell
the janitor to fix it?

27:54.214 --> 27:55.465
It's been broken for a while.

27:55.548 --> 27:58.635
Yeah, yeah,
I can, uh, hit him up.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.054
Appreciate it, bro.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.680
It-- it has been
really annoying.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.519
Oh, baby, uh,
Lucas is from Vegas.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.229
[Gavin] Fuck you!
No way!

28:09.312 --> 28:10.647
I spend like six months
out of the year in Vegas.

28:10.730 --> 28:14.734
I'm a DJ.
I open up for Tiesto
at the Wynn.

28:14.818 --> 28:15.693
I'm actually from Reno.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.905
Oh, shit, fuck.
I'm sorry, I got them confused.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.950
Nah, people get that mixed up
like all the time, so.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.119
Okay.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.662
Wait, so you're not from Vegas?

28:27.205 --> 28:29.290
No, I'm from Reno.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.710
Oh.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.003
Well, why aren't you from Vegas?

28:34.087 --> 28:36.131
Reno sucks.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.718
[cars passing]

28:44.097 --> 28:46.224
[distant horn honks]

28:46.307 --> 28:48.893
[Frank] How about some whiskey,
Baby Face?

28:48.977 --> 28:51.271
Grandpa likes to party, huh?

28:51.354 --> 28:53.606
Grandpa thinks that
you can't hold your liquor

28:53.690 --> 28:56.151
when you call a single glass
of whiskey partying.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.361
Yeah. All right, I'll take
a double, then.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.156
Ooh, bad boy.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.784
Uncle Tommy came by
earlier today looking for you.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.827
Oh, yeah?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.496
Are you gonna call him back?

29:10.498 --> 29:11.708
Just been kind of busy.

29:13.501 --> 29:17.547
I heard that you met Mrs. Tuang.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.341
She thought you were a Mormon.
[laughs]

29:20.425 --> 29:23.887
She's been with us
since the 1980s.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.847
Your pop has her rent locked.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.516
She pays something crazy
like 500 a month

29:28.600 --> 29:30.685
for her two-bedroom.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.562
I don't know
how she would get by.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.481
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.571
Why are you here, Lucas?

29:41.654 --> 29:43.698
Well, I'm going around
the apartment,

29:43.781 --> 29:46.367
introducing myself
to the tenants like you asked.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.703
No. Why are you in Los Angeles?

29:53.291 --> 29:54.959
You know why I'm here.

29:56.294 --> 29:56.794
You didn't have to come.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.382
I mean, I guess not.

30:01.466 --> 30:05.762
Okay, I-- I think
that you're here

30:06.971 --> 30:09.265
because you wanna
make peace with your old man.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.433
[Lucas laughs]

30:10.517 --> 30:11.768
-Yeah, nah.
-No.

30:11.851 --> 30:16.231
Maybe, maybe, a part of you

30:16.314 --> 30:18.233
really cares about your father,

30:18.316 --> 30:19.943
and you want
to make things right.

30:20.026 --> 30:23.404
I think you're real off
on that one.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.324
You know, most people
think that, uh, a man

30:26.407 --> 30:29.577
is supposed to keep
everything bottled up inside.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.996
But really it's much harder
to open up.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.875
You read that on a poster
at an AA meeting?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.210
Listen to me.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.423
I'm putting up with you
because I promised your father
that I would.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.677
But if you keep fucking with me,

30:45.760 --> 30:47.762
I won't hesitate to lay you out.

30:51.558 --> 30:51.891
I'm sorry.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.230
Apology accepted.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.359
Ah, I was a lot like you
when I was your age.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.239
Can I tell you something, Lucas?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.074
[Lucas] Yeah.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.582
Last year, uh...

31:21.045 --> 31:21.879
my wife.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.050
She was taken from me.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.471
I felt...

31:33.308 --> 31:35.435
I felt helpless.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.356
But, you know,

31:40.440 --> 31:43.401
a lot of people are going
through shit like you and me.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.654
A lot worse, some of them.

31:49.073 --> 31:53.077
Whenever you feel like talking,
you come over here,

31:53.161 --> 31:53.911
we'll have a couple of beers,

31:55.997 --> 31:58.249
we'll get some weight
off our chests.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.086
How'd she die?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.717
Just like your old man.

32:10.845 --> 32:11.763
[sighing]

32:11.846 --> 32:14.057
It's been a sad year
for me, Lucas.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.938
Most mornings I just lay in bed.

32:22.357 --> 32:26.319
I have to fight with myself
to struggle just to get up.

32:32.408 --> 32:32.950
I mean...

32:37.038 --> 32:38.498
why do you even get up?

32:40.458 --> 32:43.503
'Cause I learned

32:43.586 --> 32:45.713
how to appreciate
the small things in life.

32:46.964 --> 32:50.510
Find meaning
in the small things.

32:52.095 --> 32:55.807
You know, the taste
of a really good whiskey
in a glass

32:55.890 --> 32:59.310
with a big old fat ice cube
in it.

33:00.728 --> 33:00.978
[exhales]

33:03.606 --> 33:05.441
I know, it doesn't seem
like much to you,

33:05.525 --> 33:08.903
but, man, sometimes...

33:09.654 --> 33:12.073
it's all you're left with.

33:14.951 --> 33:15.576
Yeah, no.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.414
Actually, that sounds amazing.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.127
It just, uh...

33:27.255 --> 33:29.090
I don't know
how I'd ever do that.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.224
You'll get there.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.148
[Kieffer] For real, my ankle
was broken straight over.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.607
-Like, done.
-That's gross.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.942
[Kieffer] It was gross,
it was gross.

33:48.025 --> 33:50.403
But like the pain
hadn't set in yet, right?

33:50.486 --> 33:54.157
So I popped that back in,
hopped back on my board,
tried the gap one more time.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.368
I landed that,
and then I went
straight in my homie's car

33:57.452 --> 33:59.328
-to the hospital.
-[laughter]

33:59.412 --> 34:02.081
That was your first clip
on<i> Thrasher.</i>

34:02.165 --> 34:05.084
You were so darn cute.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.002
[laughter]

34:06.085 --> 34:07.920
But that ain't shit
compared to that crook

34:08.004 --> 34:10.965
on that 16
that Lucas crushed up.

34:11.048 --> 34:14.260
Damn, I'm telling you,
this boy was a skate god.

34:14.927 --> 34:18.431
Was?
Emphasis on "was."

34:18.514 --> 34:20.641
I saw this fool
try to skate the other day

34:20.725 --> 34:22.810
and he was falling
all over the place.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.021
-You were!
-[Lucas] Okay, wow, all right.

34:25.104 --> 34:27.315
And whose wrist is broken
and whose is not?

34:27.398 --> 34:28.649
That's because
you pushed me off.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.859
-Oh!
-He pushed me off.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.652
Eh, eh, no, no, no.
Go back.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.321
You never said
that you were skating again.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.406
I'm not.

34:38.117 --> 34:41.996
Yo, you remember that time
Plug just like butt chugged

34:42.079 --> 34:42.830
a 40-ounce
from the end of his board?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.999
-No...
-[Sophie] Wait, why?

34:45.082 --> 34:46.000
[Lucas]
Dude almost fucking died.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.127
So, you get your pole wet?

34:49.629 --> 34:52.256
Nah, we're just friends.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.090
You know she likes you, right?

34:54.592 --> 34:57.178
She's got a boyfriend.

34:57.261 --> 34:58.679
So?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.598
What the fuck does that mean?

35:00.681 --> 35:03.559
Hey, Tara has a husband
and I still beat that up.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.562
You're a fucking animal.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.064
You know, and she's...

35:09.398 --> 35:11.192
could be your mom,
you know that, right?

35:11.275 --> 35:12.693
I do.

35:12.777 --> 35:16.364
I fucking know that
and it's fucking awesome, bro.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.700
Damn, 'cause she's like
a mom that you can fuck.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.410
That doesn't sound right.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.040
Oh, no! Oh...
No! What the fuck? No!

35:26.123 --> 35:28.125
Dude, I'm not saying
I wanna fuck my mom.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.711
No, I'm saying
she's like a mom you can fuck.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.296
Yeah, dude I know,
I know, I get it.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.714
It just doesn't sound right.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.048
I understood
what you were saying.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.346
[Lucas] I just want
to see if you had
any like water leaks

35:40.429 --> 35:42.098
or anything like that.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.767
I'm in the apartment above
and there was just this pipe

35:44.851 --> 35:45.893
that randomly exploded.

35:45.977 --> 35:46.727
Wait, who are you?

35:46.811 --> 35:50.106
Uh, I'm Augusto's son.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.482
Yeah, but you're white.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.735
Half white.
My mom is white.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.029
Yeah, you're like 100% white.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.240
Yeah, well, I guess
you just kind of turn out

35:59.323 --> 36:03.786
looking like the parent
you actually spend time with.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.497
So you just came
down here to take over
his apartment complex?

36:06.581 --> 36:08.291
No, it's not like that.
I would never live here.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.627
I mean,
if anything, I'll probably
just like sell the place.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.422
You're gonna sell the place?
[scoffs] Great.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.381
Go, go. Go, Ron.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.925
Turn on the Craig's List alerts
for roommates

36:18.009 --> 36:20.094
-because we will be homeless.
-Stephan, this is not helping.

36:20.177 --> 36:21.679
I can't believe
this has happened!

36:21.762 --> 36:24.974
Just go have a cigarette.
Calm down.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.226
-Calm down.
-[Lucas] It's not for sure.
It's not like it...

36:45.536 --> 36:47.121
[Sophie laughs]

36:47.204 --> 36:49.290
-You're fucking with me, right?
-I'm being serious, yeah.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.292
It was that time
of the month for me

36:51.375 --> 36:54.128
and all my friends
told me that it hurt
to lose your virginity.

36:54.211 --> 36:58.132
-So, it happened.
-How was that any better?

36:58.215 --> 36:59.050
Don't judge me.
I see you judging me.

36:59.133 --> 37:02.053
All right, Brown Town,
you do you.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.138
[muffled music playing]

37:06.724 --> 37:08.935
You want kids?

37:11.729 --> 37:16.359
Mm, I don't even know
what I want, like, generally.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.570
Yeah, I don't think anyone does.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.240
And if they say they do,
then they're probably lying.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.162
Do you want kids?

37:31.123 --> 37:34.251
Is it fucked up
if I say I don't?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.671
No.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.756
-Really?
-No, not at all.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.175
Yeah, I don't know.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.974
I'll-- yeah, I'll probably
have kids.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.643
Yeah.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.103
Sounds about right.

37:52.186 --> 37:55.272
-What do you wanna name 'em?
-Hmm...

37:55.773 --> 37:57.900
I don't know.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.487
I haven't gotten that far.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.781
I don't even want kids now, so.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.701
What would you name your kids?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.869
-[knocking]
-[lighter clicks]

38:08.953 --> 38:10.871
I'm taking a huge shit!

38:10.955 --> 38:12.999
[laughing quietly]

38:13.082 --> 38:14.458
Thank you.

38:16.293 --> 38:17.253
Thank you for coming
with me tonight.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.382
For sure. Any time.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.011
It's been really hard for me
to make friends here.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.887
I mean, I have a million
and a half friends,

38:26.971 --> 38:29.598
but tonight
was really fun for me.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.402
Uh, you ever go to Vegas?

38:41.485 --> 38:42.653
See Gavin's shows?

38:45.489 --> 38:47.450
Uh, no, no, not anymore.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.248
You ready to roll, Tony Hawk?

38:57.626 --> 38:59.336
Yeah. [laughs]

38:59.879 --> 39:01.672
-Ah... Oh, sure. [laughing]
-There you go.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.718
Your back okay?
We need to get you
some Viagra, stay strong?

39:05.801 --> 39:08.012
[laughs] You're stronger
than I thought, kid.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.431
-Shut up.
-You know, bed bugs
are no joke, Lucas.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.391
Listen, I bet you
a thousand bucks

39:12.475 --> 39:14.852
if I asked you,
"Hey, you itchy right now?"
you'd scratch.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.021
Well, she's got a citation
from a pest control company.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.606
Of course she does.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.733
Pest control companies
bank on old ladies like that.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.612
And even if she does,
how bad could it be, huh?

39:24.695 --> 39:26.155
-[Lucas] Okay.
-[Mrs. Tuang] I told you.

39:26.238 --> 39:30.076
-There are so many bugs.
-Okay, yeah, but the spray
is to get rid of the bugs.

39:30.159 --> 39:33.287
-You don't want the bugs, right?
-I don't want the bugs
because...

39:33.370 --> 39:36.290
-Okay.
-...at night time when I sleep,
I have to put tissue paper

39:36.373 --> 39:37.792
in my ears
and then wear a mask.

39:37.875 --> 39:42.963
-Okay, can I look at the bugs?
-Uh, yeah, of course you can
look at them.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.632
-Okay.
-[clears throat] Yeah.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.218
Oh.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.385
-[wriggling]
-Oh, fuck!

39:48.469 --> 39:51.639
Usually, night time,
they're everywhere.

39:51.722 --> 39:55.810
I can even hear them
with my tissue paper in my ear.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.562
And, oh, you know,
even their poo poo
are very small.

But, oh, when there's a lot
of them, they stink a lot.

40:01.899 --> 40:05.736
Okay, well, you need
to clean up your place,

-All right, okay.
-There's only so much I can do.

40:09.448 --> 40:13.119
I hear ya.
How long ago
did a person come

40:13.202 --> 40:14.620
and check out your house
for bugs?

40:14.703 --> 40:16.831
-How long has it been?
-Uh, I don't know.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.415
I don't remember.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.460
Your dad always
take care of it, yeah.

[Lucas] I...

40:29.135 --> 40:30.344
I'm sorry.

40:32.263 --> 40:37.560
And I will call
the bug terminator people.

40:37.643 --> 40:41.564
Oh, I love<i> The Terminator.</i>

40:41.647 --> 40:43.482
Very good.

40:43.566 --> 40:48.404
-How often does this happen?
-No,<i> The Terminator, </i>the movie!

40:48.487 --> 40:51.407
Your dad showed me that one.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.449
My dad showed you
<i>The Terminator?</i>

40:55.119 --> 40:58.080
Yeah, he was helping me
study for my test

40:58.164 --> 41:02.084
to become an American citizen.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.211
We studied a lot.

41:06.172 --> 41:10.384
He told me about
all the American heroes--

41:10.467 --> 41:12.887
Benjamin Franklin...
[clears throat]

41:12.970 --> 41:14.889
John F. Kennedy,

41:14.972 --> 41:17.391
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
all those things.

41:17.474 --> 41:20.269
Wait, Arnold Schwarzenegger
was on the US citizen test?

41:20.352 --> 41:22.688
No, your dad and I,

41:22.771 --> 41:26.275
we had American movie night
every month.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.234
I really enjoyed that.

41:27.318 --> 41:33.741
He, uh, brought a VHS
of<i> Terminator.</i>

41:33.824 --> 41:37.244
Oh, I was so happy.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.246
Hamburgers and everything.

41:39.330 --> 41:43.959
I, uh, didn't know
he was so patriotic.

41:45.169 --> 41:49.173
-That's weird.
-Well, he learned
all these things with me.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.841
Very supportive.

41:51.550 --> 41:55.846
Yeah, he was an amazing man.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.723
You know, it's just too bad.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.352
You'll never get to know him
like that.

42:10.569 --> 42:13.322
Tonight you become a man.

42:13.405 --> 42:16.825
You watch this tonight, okay?

You have to guess.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.725
Don't tell me you moved to LA.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.852
I told Kieffer not to ruin
the surprise.

42:43.936 --> 42:46.814
-Quit my job and everything.
-Wow.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.649
Damn, you made the blankets

42:48.732 --> 42:51.360
Is it cool if I stay here

42:51.443 --> 42:53.487
Uh, that's me in there, so.

it's just been like--

42:57.366 --> 42:59.201
I'm clearing out
my dad's stuff,

42:59.285 --> 43:02.579
and it's just been
kind of weird in there
for me, you know?

43:02.663 --> 43:03.414
That's tough.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.708

I'll stay in that room.

What? What do you mean
the girls' locker room, bro?

43:24.351 --> 43:27.396
-Like, how old are these girls?
-[Lucas] Yeah, what the fuck?

-What age is that?

43:33.485 --> 43:35.529
Lucas, just sleep
in your dad's room, man.

43:35.612 --> 43:37.865
If he is a ghost,
I guarantee you
he's not in there.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.534
-He's in a girls' locker room.
-[laughter]

43:40.617 --> 43:43.662
-[Kieffer] Dude!
-I don't know, man.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.873
It's just kind of weird
being around him like that.

43:45.956 --> 43:50.002
-Didn't even like the dude.
-Dude, your dad was the shit.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.379
I mean, fuck, he took us
to every competition.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.131
He let us eat
whatever we wanted.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.008
-I smoked a joint with him once.
-What?

43:56.091 --> 43:57.885
-No, you didn't.
-[Cosmo] No, seriously.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.053
We went to go pick up
that truck.

-He totally let me hit a joint.
-Nah, you're full of shit.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.475
You're full of shit right now.
You're just fucking with me.

-How old were you, huh?
-Damn, I wish I could've smoked
a joint with your dad.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.566
Yeah, me too.

44:13.650 --> 44:15.027

Eh, fucking around.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.167
What are you up to today?

44:30.250 --> 44:32.086
I was supposed to go check out

-Word.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.284

So you always close?

55:02.632 --> 55:04.884
That's how I am, I close.

55:04.968 --> 55:06.261
-So--
-I won't take no for an answer.

55:06.344 --> 55:10.056
-Look at this, look at this,
look at this.
-Hey.

55:11.307 --> 55:13.893
-[door closes]
-What? What happened?

55:14.853 --> 55:17.564
Uh, just kind of had
like a rough night,

55:17.647 --> 55:19.315
so I'm probably gonna go to bed.

55:19.399 --> 55:22.235
It's cool, man.
We're just gonna
talk business in here.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.906
Cool, um, can you
get off my bed?

55:26.990 --> 55:30.076
-This-- this is your bed?
-Yeah.

55:30.160 --> 55:36.332
Uh, but you do know
that there is a bedroom, right?

55:36.416 --> 55:37.417
-And--
-I know-- I fucking--

55:37.500 --> 55:39.586
-Can you please just--
-Is it because of your dad?

55:39.669 --> 55:42.964
-Is it because
he slept in there?
-No, no, it's not--

55:43.048 --> 55:46.301
-I just need some space.
Can you please get up?
-All right, all right, okay.

55:46.384 --> 55:50.597
Let's-- listen, don't--
just, please, let me--

55:50.680 --> 55:52.932
Give me five minutes.
We gotta finish this thing.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.477
Luke, this is big.
All right?

55:55.560 --> 55:57.395
You could be done with this.

55:57.479 --> 55:59.105
So just give me a number, okay?

55:59.189 --> 56:02.901
Couple days, a week,
two weeks?

56:02.984 --> 56:04.486
-Yeah, two weeks.
-Two weeks? Ah!

56:04.569 --> 56:06.237
-That's fine. Thank you.
-All right.

56:06.321 --> 56:07.739
That, I can work with.

56:07.822 --> 56:10.867
[waves crashing]

56:23.880 --> 56:24.380
Oil's clean.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.887
Coolant's good.
You know what, put the cable
back on the distributor

56:30.970 --> 56:32.222
that's heating the coil.

56:32.305 --> 56:34.682
-[Lucas] Right here, right?
-Yeah.

56:34.766 --> 56:37.519
-[Lucas] Yeah, all right.
-Yeah, make sure it's tight.

56:37.602 --> 56:40.146
-[Lucas] How about that, huh?
-Good.

56:40.230 --> 56:41.648
Good job, kid.

56:41.731 --> 56:42.857
Marine tattoo?

56:42.941 --> 56:44.776
Yeah, yeah.

56:44.859 --> 56:47.195
I served my country.

56:47.278 --> 56:49.197
I was in the Marines.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.657
Thought it was a jail tat
at first.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.575
No.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.957
-Ever been to jail?
-[chuckles] No.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.458
No, I've done some dumb things
when I was a kid,

57:00.542 --> 57:03.336
but I was never dumb enough
to get caught.

57:03.837 --> 57:05.839
You?

57:05.922 --> 57:07.132
Once.

57:08.258 --> 57:11.970
Yeah, painted a dick
on a dumpster once.

57:12.053 --> 57:13.429
-[laughs]
-In middle school.

57:13.513 --> 57:15.890
Yeah, principal called the cops.

57:15.974 --> 57:17.976
Like, just to scare us and shit.

57:18.059 --> 57:20.645
And they actually
fucking arrested us.

57:20.728 --> 57:21.563
It's so stupid.

57:21.646 --> 57:23.356
Kind of funny
thinking back on it, though.

57:23.439 --> 57:28.361
Wow, that's, uh--
that sounds dumb.

57:28.444 --> 57:30.738
I bet your mom didn't think
that was too funny, huh?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.615
I don't even know
if she found out, to be honest.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.075
They called my dad.

57:35.785 --> 57:37.787
I think that was like
the last conversation,

57:37.871 --> 57:40.665
like real conversation
I had with him.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.168
It's amazing.

57:44.169 --> 57:48.548
To think that some
of the most important
moments in our life...

57:50.341 --> 57:52.385
they don't seem important
at the time.

57:55.638 --> 57:59.601
What was the last conversation
you had with him?

57:59.684 --> 58:00.685
Well, it was right down here.

58:00.768 --> 58:04.230
Your dad was sitting over there
on that dumpy chair.

58:04.314 --> 58:06.774
He was smoking a joint
and he was laughing.

58:06.858 --> 58:10.445
He was interviewing me
on this little recorder device.

58:10.528 --> 58:12.572
Pretending he was like
Larry King or something.

58:12.655 --> 58:14.282
-[laughs]
-Did he do a good impression?

58:14.365 --> 58:16.409
No, no, no,
that's why it was funny.

58:16.492 --> 58:19.078
[laughs]
Look, your dad...

58:19.162 --> 58:22.582
your dad had this quality
about him, Lucas.

58:22.665 --> 58:25.668
You never knew
what he was gonna do next,

58:25.752 --> 58:28.922
but you always wanted
to stick around to find out.

58:29.005 --> 58:31.466
It was magic,
just like this positive force.

58:35.011 --> 58:36.971
I guess I didn't
get that from him.

58:37.055 --> 58:37.639
Oh, yeah, you did.

58:37.722 --> 58:39.349
[laughs]

58:39.432 --> 58:42.268
Your dad would show me
these VHS tapes

58:42.352 --> 58:44.646
of you skateboarding
when you were a kid.

58:44.729 --> 58:47.106
You never shut the hell up.

58:47.190 --> 58:48.483
[laughing]

58:50.360 --> 58:52.946
I don't know, man,
it's like...

58:55.073 --> 58:57.116
I hate to say it, but, uh...

58:58.201 --> 59:01.829
the more I hear about him,
the cooler he sounds.

59:03.957 --> 59:06.668
Kind of makes it worse
that he had, uh...

59:07.669 --> 59:09.128
no reason to be around me.

59:11.005 --> 59:13.508
Sometimes what a man
wants to do,

59:16.469 --> 59:18.471
and what a man is able to do
are two different things.

59:23.893 --> 59:29.107
-Yeah.
-Just remember that next time
before you judge the man.

59:33.403 --> 59:36.656

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:21.451
Yo, yo, need a hand?

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:23.036
Uh, I'm good.

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:25.163
I appreciate it, though.

1:00:25.246 --> 1:00:27.707
Aw, come on,
I got you, big dawg.

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:31.377
Like these things?

1:00:32.545 --> 1:00:35.256
Not really, I just didn't have
any food at my place.

1:00:37.508 --> 1:00:39.218
You know who loves these things?

1:00:43.598 --> 1:00:43.681
Who?

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:47.268
Sophie.

1:00:47.977 --> 1:00:48.394
Yeah.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:50.938
Yeah, she's obsessed.

1:00:51.022 --> 1:00:51.981
Yeah, last year
for her birthday,

1:00:52.065 --> 1:00:54.484
I got the tamale guy
to do a special appearance.

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:56.361
He wore the sombrero,
the whole thing.

1:00:56.444 --> 1:00:58.446
Oh, she fucking loved it.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:01:00.406
-Yeah. That's-- that's cool.
-Yeah.

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:02.283
Yeah, it was cool.

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:04.202
You know,
I like to make her happy,
I like to see her smile.

1:01:04.285 --> 1:01:07.789
-She's a good girl.
-Yeah.

1:01:07.872 --> 1:01:11.667
Girls, you know,
sometimes it just takes
the simplest little thing.

1:01:11.751 --> 1:01:13.795
Oh, dude, the other night,
I was DJ-ing--

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:16.589
I'm a DJ-- I was DJ-ing
the other night at UCLA,

1:01:16.672 --> 1:01:18.800
and this sorority girl
tried to suck my dick on stage.

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:22.053
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:22.804
No, I'm lying.
Yeah, dude.

1:01:22.887 --> 1:01:24.806
I mean, I didn't do it,
of course.

1:01:24.889 --> 1:01:26.599
I don't cheat on my girl.

1:01:26.682 --> 1:01:29.310
I'm not-- I'm not
a fucking piece of shit,
you know.

1:01:29.394 --> 1:01:31.729
-Yeah.
-But I could have.

1:01:31.813 --> 1:01:33.481
And I could have cheated
on her a lot of times,
but I don't do it.

1:01:33.564 --> 1:01:36.192
-Mm.
-Yeah, it's just bad karma.

1:01:36.275 --> 1:01:37.443
I don't...

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:38.820
It's just not--
you know what I mean?

1:01:38.903 --> 1:01:40.154
-It's just not cool.
-Yeah.

1:01:40.238 --> 1:01:41.280
Yeah. So--

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:43.866
-Do you mind?
-Hmm?

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:44.951
-Can I have a bite?
-Sure.

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:47.495
Yeah, my man.

1:01:47.578 --> 1:01:49.497
Haven't had
one of these bangers
in a minute.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:53.876
Oh, my God, this is the best!

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:56.129
Mm! Anyway, here.

1:01:58.548 --> 1:02:01.551
Oh, and by the way,

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:03.136
I know what's happening.

1:02:07.348 --> 1:02:09.267
Yeah, that key
is for the apartment door

1:02:09.350 --> 1:02:10.685
and not the mailbox.

1:02:10.768 --> 1:02:12.854
You'll figure it out, homie.

I mean, they're just black.

1:02:45.261 --> 1:02:45.803
Yeah, but they're cute.

1:02:48.222 --> 1:02:51.184

-We grew up together.
-No way.

1:02:58.941 --> 1:03:01.319
So, a white nigga's talking
about Guala Boy.

1:03:01.402 --> 1:03:02.695
Yeah, is he here?

1:03:04.614 --> 1:03:05.781

1:07:08.774 --> 1:07:11.110
I'm that guy now, you know?

1:07:11.193 --> 1:07:12.403
Hmm.

1:07:13.362 --> 1:07:16.449
You, uh, guys going
to a wedding, or...?

1:07:16.532 --> 1:07:17.825
No time like the present.

1:07:17.908 --> 1:07:19.076
Show him the ring I got, babe.

1:07:21.954 --> 1:07:23.456
It's a long time coming.

1:07:26.667 --> 1:07:28.586
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1:07:30.087 --> 1:07:32.006
[Gavin] We're actually having
an engagement party tonight

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:33.340
if you wanna roll through.

1:07:34.550 --> 1:07:35.551
[Lucas]
<i>Don't even try it.</i>

1:07:36.635 --> 1:07:37.636
Don't even try
and convince me not to

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:43.309
because I am so, so far past

1:07:43.392 --> 1:07:44.894
having made my decision.

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:46.061
I'm selling the place.

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:49.690
Well, I would say
congratulations

1:07:49.774 --> 1:07:52.651
on making a decision,

1:07:52.735 --> 1:07:55.988
but you're on the fence,
Lucas, I can tell.

1:07:56.071 --> 1:07:57.114
No, I'm not.

1:07:57.198 --> 1:07:57.782
You're fucking up,
Baby Face.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:08:00.367
You're coming from a bad place.

1:08:00.451 --> 1:08:01.994
This isn't my mess.

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:09.293
All right? I don't wanna
babysit this apartment
till the day I die.

1:08:11.170 --> 1:08:12.797
I'm not happy here, man.

1:08:13.631 --> 1:08:14.089
You're not happy here.

1:08:16.300 --> 1:08:17.676
You're not happy in Reno.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:20.679
You're not happy
anywhere, Lucas.

1:08:21.472 --> 1:08:24.016
It's you.
You're not happy.

1:08:24.099 --> 1:08:27.520
No matter where you are
because it's in here

1:08:27.603 --> 1:08:29.522
and it's in here.

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:32.399
Yeah, like you know best?

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:35.736
The guy working
in this pile of shit

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:38.280
for some dead asshole.

1:08:40.407 --> 1:08:41.700
That's the problem
with kids nowadays.

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:44.662
You just want everything easy.

1:08:45.955 --> 1:08:48.457
Avoiding discomfort
the second you feel it.

1:08:52.294 --> 1:08:55.506
Bet you haven't gone through
your father's stuff yet, huh?

1:08:57.007 --> 1:08:59.051
Oh, God forbid, Lucas.

1:08:59.134 --> 1:09:02.638
God forbid that you find
something that reminds you
of your dad.

1:09:02.721 --> 1:09:05.891
-I'm sorry, but fuck him.
-He loved you, Lucas.

1:09:06.725 --> 1:09:08.143
You-- You were
everything to him.

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:14.149
Yeah.

1:09:16.026 --> 1:09:17.111
Loved me enough
to show his face.

1:09:19.154 --> 1:09:21.949
There's two sides
to every story.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:25.327
And it looks like
you've only heard one.

1:09:27.872 --> 1:09:29.915
What the fuck does that mean?

1:09:29.999 --> 1:09:34.253
Your dad went to Reno
to see you a lot.

1:09:34.336 --> 1:09:38.215
And your mom called the cops
on him every time he went.

1:09:38.299 --> 1:09:41.510
He spent a night in jail
just trying to see his son.

1:09:43.846 --> 1:09:45.306
Your mother, Lucas,
she used you

1:09:45.389 --> 1:09:48.100
as a bargaining chip
in their divorce.

1:09:48.183 --> 1:09:50.644
Your dad, he smoked
a little bit of pot,

1:09:50.728 --> 1:09:53.898
but your mom,
she wanted full custody
to move on clean.

1:09:56.692 --> 1:10:01.322
Then why am I being
told this now?

1:10:04.909 --> 1:10:07.119
Fifteen fucking years later,

1:10:07.202 --> 1:10:09.121
-you're telling me
this fucking now?
-[object crashes]

1:10:09.204 --> 1:10:12.374
It doesn't fucking matter!
He's dead!

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:18.297
I needed him ten years ago.

1:10:20.591 --> 1:10:21.842
And where the fuck is--

1:10:23.552 --> 1:10:25.387
Fuck, dude!

1:10:26.472 --> 1:10:27.723
Why am I fucking...

1:10:29.224 --> 1:10:32.394
even fucking angry
about this shit, dude?

1:10:32.478 --> 1:10:34.229
-It's okay to be angry, Lucas.
-It's not!

1:10:34.313 --> 1:10:36.148
It's not fucking okay!

1:10:36.231 --> 1:10:38.567
It's not okay
that he did that!

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:41.320
You wanna shoot the messenger,
Lucas, go ahead.

1:10:43.906 --> 1:10:46.200
But like I told you,
there's two sides
to every story,

1:10:46.283 --> 1:10:47.242
and you don't really know
your dad.

1:10:49.328 --> 1:10:51.372
[dramatic music]

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:21.735
-[tires screech]
-[keys jingle]

1:11:21.819 --> 1:11:24.863
[chattering]

1:11:25.990 --> 1:11:28.117
[chatter continues]

1:11:31.412 --> 1:11:32.371
Hey, Gavin!

1:11:32.454 --> 1:11:34.081
-That's your friend
with the dead dad.
-Yeah.

1:11:34.164 --> 1:11:36.125
-What's his name again?
-Lucas.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:38.168
Whoa! Whoa!

1:11:38.252 --> 1:11:39.753
What are you doing, dude?

1:11:39.837 --> 1:11:41.296
-You don't deserve her.
-Hey!

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:43.007
[man] Okay, no, no,
Gavin, don't take--

1:11:43.090 --> 1:11:45.426
-Hey, watch out.
-Oh, you wanna fight?

1:11:45.509 --> 1:11:46.927
You wanna--
Come on, hit me, do it.

1:11:47.011 --> 1:11:48.887
-[all shouting]
-Oh, shit!

1:11:51.890 --> 1:11:53.100
Lucas!

1:11:57.146 --> 1:11:59.148
[thunder rumbling]

1:11:59.231 --> 1:12:00.232
[gunfire on TV]

1:12:02.526 --> 1:12:03.986
Have you guys seen my lighter?

1:12:04.069 --> 1:12:05.738
-[gunfire continues]
-[game controllers clicking]

1:12:05.821 --> 1:12:08.073
[Kieffer laughing]

1:12:09.658 --> 1:12:10.951
[Kieffer] Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:13.954
-[Cosmo]
Yo, you're blocking the view.
-Dude, just fucking turn it off!

1:12:14.038 --> 1:12:15.622
Turn it off for a second!

1:12:16.498 --> 1:12:19.376
I'm done, dude.
I'm fucking done.

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.962
I'm selling this place.
Fuck LA.

1:12:22.046 --> 1:12:23.255
What?

1:12:23.338 --> 1:12:25.090
[Lucas]
I'm selling the apartments.

1:12:26.216 --> 1:12:27.968
-To who?
-[Lucas] I don't give a shit.

1:12:28.052 --> 1:12:30.512
I don't know, anybody.

1:12:30.596 --> 1:12:32.556
My Uncle Tommy's
got some people lined up.

1:12:32.639 --> 1:12:34.224
I don't fucking know.

1:12:34.308 --> 1:12:36.602
-Is this about that chick?
-[Lucas] No, it's not about--

1:12:36.685 --> 1:12:38.937
You guys seemed super happy
last time we hung out.

1:12:39.021 --> 1:12:40.314
God, no it's not
about the fucking chick.

1:12:47.362 --> 1:12:49.448
I mean, like,
maybe part of it is.

1:12:52.868 --> 1:12:54.953
-[sighs]
-A'ight. Yo.

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:57.289
This stays between us.

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:02.586
The last year
I almost quit the team.

1:13:02.669 --> 1:13:05.297
Can we just not talk
about skateboarding
for like two seconds?

1:13:07.549 --> 1:13:08.801
-It's a metaphor, Lucas.
-Oh, God.

1:13:08.884 --> 1:13:10.969
Hey, just listen.

1:13:13.514 --> 1:13:14.431
I put so much pressure
on myself.

1:13:15.390 --> 1:13:18.977
You know, like, just--
it adds up, bro.

1:13:19.061 --> 1:13:20.646
Like, it just becomes too much.

1:13:20.729 --> 1:13:22.398
It's not fun anymore.

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:24.399
Yeah.

1:13:26.318 --> 1:13:28.362
Yeah, so I just peaced out.

1:13:28.445 --> 1:13:31.365
You know, I didn't even tell
anybody where I was going.

1:13:31.448 --> 1:13:33.784
I just bounced out of town
for like three weeks.

1:13:33.867 --> 1:13:35.119
Didn't even take my phone.

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:38.455
But when I came back,
everything was fine.

1:13:40.415 --> 1:13:43.210
Damn, you didn't even invite me.

1:13:44.545 --> 1:13:47.631
Hey, all I'm saying is sometimes

1:13:47.714 --> 1:13:50.425
you just gotta like
take a step back.

1:13:51.593 --> 1:13:53.137
For real, Lucas.

1:13:53.220 --> 1:13:54.471
[Lucas] Mm.

1:13:54.555 --> 1:13:56.348
Oh, shit, eh.

1:13:56.431 --> 1:13:57.850
You're the type of dude
who'll kill at whatever
you do.

1:13:57.933 --> 1:14:00.352
[chuckles]

1:14:00.435 --> 1:14:02.271
Unless it's being a landlord.
Then you're fucked.

1:14:02.354 --> 1:14:04.439
[all laugh]

1:14:04.523 --> 1:14:07.359
[light music playing]

1:14:59.536 --> 1:15:02.664
[Jane on phone]
<i>Hey, you're up early.</i>

1:15:04.875 --> 1:15:08.086
Um, yeah.

1:15:09.296 --> 1:15:10.714
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1:15:11.131 --> 1:15:13.217
I mean...

1:15:17.054 --> 1:15:18.680
no, I'm not.

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.559
<i>You're safe, though,</i>
<i>right now, right?</i>

1:15:24.978 --> 1:15:26.355
Yeah, I'm safe.

1:15:35.239 --> 1:15:36.365
Mom...

1:15:41.370 --> 1:15:42.579
I know you kept him from me.

1:15:54.758 --> 1:15:58.262
I should have let your father
see you more.

1:16:00.097 --> 1:16:01.765
I'm so sorry, honey.

1:16:04.851 --> 1:16:05.769
I messed up.

1:16:07.062 --> 1:16:07.604
I messed up bad.

1:16:10.148 --> 1:16:12.234
I was trying to protect you,
but I ended up hurting you more

1:16:12.317 --> 1:16:14.569
by not letting him see you.

1:16:19.366 --> 1:16:21.076
[sighs]

1:16:22.869 --> 1:16:24.288
Your dad...

1:16:26.373 --> 1:16:27.708
total idiot.

1:16:29.251 --> 1:16:32.671
But he cared about you.
He did.

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:42.597
<i>Parents,</i>
<i>we're-- we're just kids</i>
<i>who somehow got old.</i>

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:10.709
Where do we go from here?

1:17:10.792 --> 1:17:13.420
-[water stops]
-[Lucas] What the fuck, dude?

1:17:13.503 --> 1:17:15.255
-I'm naked, get out.
-Well, come on.

1:17:15.339 --> 1:17:16.923
What are you doing?

1:17:17.007 --> 1:17:20.218
The buyers, man, the buyers,
they pulled out.

1:17:20.302 --> 1:17:23.639
Look, Uncle Tommy,
at first I really appreciated
you helping me out...

1:17:25.932 --> 1:17:28.352
but it's starting to seem
pretty obvious

1:17:28.435 --> 1:17:31.438
you're like desperate for money.

1:17:34.524 --> 1:17:35.734
I mean, what's up, man?

1:17:36.318 --> 1:17:38.695
I'm in a lot of debt.

1:17:41.031 --> 1:17:43.575
I don't even know how I'm gonna
make this month's mortgages.

1:17:45.786 --> 1:17:46.995
I have no idea.

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:48.622
I was counting...

1:17:52.042 --> 1:17:53.251
Forget it.

1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:57.798
Maybe I can lend you some money
from the apartments.

1:18:00.884 --> 1:18:02.552
Till you get on your feet.

1:18:02.636 --> 1:18:03.845
Would that help?

1:18:07.015 --> 1:18:08.100
Huh?

1:18:09.184 --> 1:18:10.644
Yes, yes.

1:18:11.853 --> 1:18:12.187
That would be great.

1:18:12.270 --> 1:18:14.940
And, I mean...

1:18:15.023 --> 1:18:17.692
there's also like 30,000
for the car

1:18:17.776 --> 1:18:21.071
and, uh, 10,000 for the boat.

1:18:21.154 --> 1:18:23.657
Yeah, I can't do that, man.
I'm sorry.

1:18:26.368 --> 1:18:28.662
You're a good man, Lucas.

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:34.793
Being an adult sucks.

1:18:34.876 --> 1:18:36.503
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1:18:37.796 --> 1:18:40.674
It's, uh-- it does blow.

1:18:42.384 --> 1:18:44.052
Hey, look, I don't wanna
start any shit.

1:18:44.136 --> 1:18:46.680
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1:18:52.227 --> 1:18:53.311
Okay.

1:18:59.067 --> 1:19:00.819
Come with me.

1:19:00.902 --> 1:19:02.821
What?

1:19:02.904 --> 1:19:04.156
No. Where?

1:19:04.239 --> 1:19:06.700
It'll be like our version
of<i> The Graduate.</i>

1:19:10.537 --> 1:19:12.706
I'm getting married in ten days.

1:19:12.789 --> 1:19:16.001
Ah, yeah,
it's gonna take awhile.

1:19:16.084 --> 1:19:18.003
Probably should just like
call the whole thing off.

1:19:18.086 --> 1:19:18.712
It's not funny, Lucas.

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:22.257
I can't go with you.

1:19:25.469 --> 1:19:27.053
I mean, of course you can.

1:19:30.932 --> 1:19:32.768
But you don't want to.

1:19:32.851 --> 1:19:35.187
And that's what I came here
to find out.

1:19:36.104 --> 1:19:38.565
Part of me
really wants to, but I...

1:19:40.734 --> 1:19:40.775
I won't.

1:19:44.362 --> 1:19:46.156
Whatever happened
to the whole "live free,

1:19:46.239 --> 1:19:48.116
follow your dreams,
artist girl" shit, huh?

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:51.411
Maybe I was just full of shit.

1:19:53.788 --> 1:19:54.789
Maybe I am just full of shit.

1:19:59.294 --> 1:20:00.795
You are so intense, Lucas.

1:20:03.507 --> 1:20:04.883
And I-- I thought...

1:20:06.301 --> 1:20:08.553
I thought I knew
what I wanted, but I just...

1:20:10.972 --> 1:20:12.849
I don't.

1:20:12.933 --> 1:20:15.936
Look, the only reason
you think everything's fine
all of the time

1:20:16.019 --> 1:20:20.106
is because he doesn't
think about anything
in a real way, ever.

1:20:20.190 --> 1:20:23.568
It's just like
some bullshit illusion.

1:20:26.029 --> 1:20:30.492
Maybe I'd rather
live in some bullshit,
comfortable illusion

1:20:30.575 --> 1:20:31.868
than some dark version
of reality.

1:20:34.496 --> 1:20:36.248
Did you ever think about that?

1:20:38.291 --> 1:20:41.169
I know that you think
that I'm your answer,

1:20:42.337 --> 1:20:43.922
but I'm-- I'm not.

1:20:47.008 --> 1:20:50.220
You know that whole thing
that, like,

1:20:50.303 --> 1:20:53.807
"you can't love somebody
unless you love yourself" thing?

1:20:58.353 --> 1:21:01.147
I mean, it's bullshit.

1:21:07.612 --> 1:21:10.115
Being there for somebody else
when you're down,

1:21:10.198 --> 1:21:10.907
that's fucking real love.

1:21:15.954 --> 1:21:18.873
So, why'd you go
on that road trip with me?

1:21:25.630 --> 1:21:25.922
I needed it.

1:21:29.551 --> 1:21:32.262
Just... something different.

1:21:36.099 --> 1:21:38.476
And you seemed like
a lot of fun.

1:21:40.895 --> 1:21:41.855
Well...

1:21:44.399 --> 1:21:44.858
surprise.

1:21:49.738 --> 1:21:49.904
Yeah.

1:21:52.282 --> 1:21:55.243
[light music playing]

1:22:12.761 --> 1:22:14.846
[no audible dialogue]

1:22:39.579 --> 1:22:39.996
[Lucas]<i> I can't do it.</i>

1:22:45.335 --> 1:22:47.253
Alone.

1:22:49.297 --> 1:22:51.257
I'm-- I'm keeping
the apartments,

1:22:51.341 --> 1:22:53.301
but, uh, I can't do it
without you.

1:22:53.385 --> 1:22:55.845
What's this?

1:22:56.805 --> 1:22:59.849
[chuckles]
You know that this
doesn't legally bind anything.

1:22:59.933 --> 1:23:00.934
Yeah, I know.

1:23:01.017 --> 1:23:03.311
It's more of a symbolic thing.

1:23:03.395 --> 1:23:04.729
I was gonna ask
Uncle Tommy to help me

1:23:04.813 --> 1:23:07.607
with his lawyer
create something,

1:23:07.691 --> 1:23:10.568
but I'm pretty sure
he's one of those legal shield
scam artists, so.

1:23:10.652 --> 1:23:12.696
[laughs] Yeah.

1:23:12.779 --> 1:23:16.741
I know, it was, uh,
the best I could do.

1:23:18.326 --> 1:23:19.244
I'll see you around, Frank.

1:23:19.327 --> 1:23:21.746
Hey, Baby Face.

1:23:25.041 --> 1:23:26.376
Be well, my friend.

1:23:54.028 --> 1:23:55.447
[Augusto]<i> Hey, Lucas.</i>

1:23:57.157 --> 1:24:00.577
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>
<i>I'm probably dead.</i>

1:24:02.412 --> 1:24:03.621
<i>God...</i>

1:24:04.247 --> 1:24:06.332
<i>when did I get so old?</i>

1:24:08.042 --> 1:24:13.131
<i>I don't know if you're ever</i>
<i>really ready to die,</i>

1:24:13.214 --> 1:24:18.261
<i>but, uh, maybe that means</i>
<i>you've always been</i>
<i>ready to die.</i>

1:24:20.305 --> 1:24:24.642
<i>Anyways, I wish</i>
<i>things were different.</i>

1:24:24.726 --> 1:24:28.897
<i>I just wish we had</i>
<i>a chance to just...</i>

1:24:29.647 --> 1:24:32.650
<i>hang out more, you know?</i>

1:24:36.112 --> 1:24:39.324
<i>I used to worry about you.</i>

1:24:39.407 --> 1:24:41.451
<i>A lot.</i>

1:24:42.452 --> 1:24:45.246
<i>But, uh, honestly,</i>

1:24:45.330 --> 1:24:47.165
<i>I'm not worried</i>
<i>about you, Lucas.</i>

1:24:47.248 --> 1:24:49.709
<i>You always had a drive</i>
<i>for something more,</i>

1:24:49.793 --> 1:24:53.713
<i>and I think that's a gift.</i>

1:24:53.797 --> 1:24:58.176
<i>Just don't be so hard</i>
<i>on yourself all the time.</i>

1:24:58.259 --> 1:25:02.347
<i>Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>you drove us crazy.</i>

1:25:02.430 --> 1:25:04.933
[chuckles]<i> Locking yourself up</i>
<i>in the skate park bathroom.</i>

1:25:05.016 --> 1:25:11.272
<i>But life or death</i>
<i>isn't life either.</i>

1:25:13.525 --> 1:25:16.027
<i>I think you get that</i>
<i>from your mom.</i>

1:25:16.110 --> 1:25:21.533
<i>She's driven by</i>
<i>the what-ifs of the world.</i>

1:25:23.076 --> 1:25:25.411
<i>The only way I know</i>
<i>how to operate</i>

1:25:25.495 --> 1:25:28.498
<i>is by the what-is.</i>

1:25:28.581 --> 1:25:31.709
[light music playing]

1:25:31.793 --> 1:25:34.546
<i>I don't blame her, though.</i>

1:25:34.629 --> 1:25:38.758
<i>I do have to give her</i>
<i>some major props.</i>

1:25:38.842 --> 1:25:40.718
<i>Jane...</i>

1:25:40.802 --> 1:25:42.887
<i>now that's a woman.</i>

1:25:42.971 --> 1:25:47.725
<i>Deep down,</i>
<i>a real, tough bitch.</i>

1:25:47.809 --> 1:25:54.482
<i>In the most loving and</i>
<i>amazingly unapologetic way</i>
<i>possible.</i>

1:25:54.566 --> 1:25:57.735
<i>She did what she had to do</i>
<i>to take care of you.</i>

1:25:57.819 --> 1:26:01.114
<i>I respect her for that.</i>

1:26:01.197 --> 1:26:04.534
<i>I think I always played</i>

1:26:04.617 --> 1:26:07.996
<i>the good cop</i>
<i>to her bad cop.</i>

1:26:08.079 --> 1:26:09.914
<i>And it wasn't fair to her.</i>

1:26:09.998 --> 1:26:12.250
<i>She got fed up with it.</i>

1:26:12.333 --> 1:26:14.252
<i>Things changed.</i>

1:26:14.335 --> 1:26:15.295
<i>I let it happen.</i>

1:26:15.378 --> 1:26:20.967
<i>I just wish I-- I knew</i>
<i>how to tell you that.</i>

1:26:24.554 --> 1:26:25.805
<i>So, um...</i>

1:26:25.889 --> 1:26:28.892
[clicks tongue, sighs]

1:26:28.975 --> 1:26:30.727
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:26:34.355 --> 1:26:37.192
<i>You know, you're getting</i>
<i>to be the age</i>

1:26:37.275 --> 1:26:39.569
<i>when I became a dad.</i>

1:26:40.695 --> 1:26:42.155
<i>Weird, right?</i>

1:26:43.489 --> 1:26:45.533
<i>Gonna be honest here.</i>

1:26:45.617 --> 1:26:47.952
<i>I never thought I wanted kids.</i>

1:26:48.036 --> 1:26:50.955
<i>And, man, I tell you,</i>

1:26:51.039 --> 1:26:53.750
<i>it is not a conversation</i>
<i>you wanna have</i>

1:26:53.833 --> 1:26:55.752
<i>with a pregnant woman.</i>

1:26:55.835 --> 1:26:58.546
<i>That definitely bit me</i>
<i>in the ass.</i>

1:27:00.048 --> 1:27:03.134
<i>What tore me up</i>
<i>is after you were born,</i>

1:27:03.217 --> 1:27:04.969
<i>I still didn't want a kid.</i>

1:27:06.095 --> 1:27:10.433
<i>But I-- I wanted Lucas.</i>

1:27:15.396 --> 1:27:19.400
<i>When you were a kid</i>
<i>and I started skating with you,</i>

1:27:19.484 --> 1:27:22.987
<i>I fell in love with it</i>
<i>because I finally found</i>

1:27:23.071 --> 1:27:26.032
<i>a language to speak with you.</i>

1:27:26.115 --> 1:27:29.827
<i>But you learn other languages.</i>

1:27:29.911 --> 1:27:34.374
<i>And, uh, with the apartments,</i>
<i>they're important.</i>

1:27:34.457 --> 1:27:39.128
<i>Not because of the cash</i>
<i>or superficial value,</i>

1:27:39.212 --> 1:27:42.465
<i>but because I wanted</i>
<i>to leave you something</i>

1:27:42.548 --> 1:27:44.801
<i>that you could use.</i>

1:27:44.884 --> 1:27:48.179
<i>Something you could have</i>
<i>as a man, you know.</i>

1:27:55.770 --> 1:27:58.356
<i>or to even manage it at all,</i>

1:27:58.439 --> 1:28:00.692
<i>but there's definitely</i>
<i>some things</i>

1:28:00.775 --> 1:28:02.235
<i>worth learning</i>
<i>from the tenants.</i>

1:28:02.318 --> 1:28:06.572
<i>I have some stories</i>

1:28:06.656 --> 1:28:10.576
[chuckling]

1:28:10.660 --> 1:28:15.164

1:28:15.248 --> 1:28:16.582
<i>You may too.</i>

1:28:21.838 --> 1:28:23.881
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

1:28:23.965 --> 1:28:29.804
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>that I love you.</i>

1:28:29.887 --> 1:28:33.433
<i>And planet Earth has got</i>
<i>a few more rotations in it.</i>

1:28:38.813 --> 1:28:41.399
<i>Oh, and also...</i>

1:28:41.482 --> 1:28:44.402
<i>there's a really wonky pipe</i>
<i>under the bathroom sink.</i>

1:28:44.485 --> 1:28:48.197
<i>Get Frank to help you</i>
<i>with that before I forget.</i>

1:28:48.281 --> 1:28:50.491
