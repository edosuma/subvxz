00:05.346 --> 00:07.181
Corky found out
his wife had disappeared

00:07.183 --> 00:08.816
and his daughter
had been murdered.

00:08.818 --> 00:10.518
We need that ledger,
Miss Lockwood.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.353
The hag's been
blackmailing

00:12.355 --> 00:14.122
all the men who paid
Grindle for abortions.

00:14.124 --> 00:15.123
Mary!

00:15.125 --> 00:17.392
I know what
you did to Annie.

00:19.128 --> 00:21.763
But if
Lincoln wins,

00:21.765 --> 00:23.498
New York will burn.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.099
Very impressive.

01:14.068 --> 01:16.168

Hurrah! *

01:17.839 --> 01:19.972

01:19.974 --> 01:21.474
Hey!
Damn copperhead!

01:35.757 --> 01:38.591
Name's
Angus Fraser.

01:38.593 --> 01:41.093
Angus Fraser.

01:41.095 --> 01:42.194
McClellan.

01:42.196 --> 01:44.864
Mark your ballot
right there.

01:49.469 --> 01:51.470
What are you
dragging me

01:51.472 --> 01:52.972
up here to
Central Park for?

01:52.974 --> 01:55.207
I'm still training you,
Little Byrnes.

01:55.209 --> 01:57.042
What have you learned,
so far, huh?

01:57.044 --> 01:58.844
If you
give me an order,

01:58.846 --> 02:00.279
I follow the order.

02:00.281 --> 02:01.981
That's right.
There you are.

02:01.983 --> 02:03.649
Now go grab one
of them sheep.

02:03.651 --> 02:05.918
What do sheeps got to do
with crime in Five Points?

02:05.920 --> 02:07.420
Get one big enough
for four,

02:07.422 --> 02:08.920
so we can feed
your sorry face.

02:08.923 --> 02:11.123
My wife's sister is
coming, too... Judith.

02:11.125 --> 02:13.392
Hmm.
Is she a looker?

02:13.394 --> 02:14.927
Yeah, she looks
just like my wife.

02:14.929 --> 02:16.996
But better?

02:16.998 --> 02:18.497
Go on, get,
I said, eh?

02:18.499 --> 02:20.833
Come on.
Come on.

02:20.835 --> 02:22.401
Ah, Je-sus.

02:26.506 --> 02:28.774
Ahh, Detective,
come over here!

02:28.776 --> 02:31.143
What, you skin
your knee?

02:31.145 --> 02:32.278
Ah, no no no.
Hurry, hurry.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.282
Thief! Thief!

02:36.284 --> 02:37.783
Come back here,
you damn copperhead!

02:37.785 --> 02:40.486
Thief! Stop!

02:40.488 --> 02:42.021
Mr. Morehouse.

02:42.023 --> 02:44.056
Mrs. Haverford.

02:47.761 --> 02:49.261
Out and about,
unescorted?

02:49.263 --> 02:52.364
Only a short
distance.

02:52.366 --> 02:54.667
To the Fifth Avenue
hotel.

02:54.669 --> 02:56.735
The Booth brothers
have extended

02:56.737 --> 02:58.771
an invitation
for tea.

02:58.773 --> 03:00.639
We're meeting to discuss
their upcoming

03:00.641 --> 03:02.374
performance
to raise funds

03:02.376 --> 03:05.177
for the
Shakespeare statue.

03:05.179 --> 03:07.680
"Journeys end
in lovers meeting,

03:07.682 --> 03:11.350
every wise man's
son doth know."

03:11.352 --> 03:13.519
Perhaps you'd rather
join me at my home

03:13.521 --> 03:16.422
for something more
substantial than tea.

03:16.424 --> 03:18.290
Sounds delectable.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.059
But I've made
a promise.

03:20.061 --> 03:21.126
You wouldn't want me
to break a promise,

03:21.128 --> 03:22.661
now, would you?

03:22.663 --> 03:25.464
Just as you wouldn't
break a promise

03:25.466 --> 03:26.966
you made to me.

03:26.968 --> 03:30.002
I will confront
Kevin Corcoran.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.646
If you're free tonight,
perhaps you'd like

03:40.648 --> 03:42.381
to join father
and me for dinner

03:42.383 --> 03:44.683
as we await the results
of the election.

03:44.685 --> 03:46.118
Say 6:00.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.053
I'd be delighted.

04:02.035 --> 04:05.170
Matthew,
what brings you

04:05.172 --> 04:06.672
to Five Points
on election day?

04:06.674 --> 04:08.374
Major Morehouse
visited me,

04:08.376 --> 04:10.409
asked me to test
a liquid...

04:10.411 --> 04:11.644
Greek fire.

04:11.646 --> 04:13.379
The explosive?

04:13.381 --> 04:14.713
Yes. Morehouse said
he was making

04:14.715 --> 04:16.081
a business
investment.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.983
So?

04:17.985 --> 04:20.719
And I know you've heard
the rumors, too...

04:20.721 --> 04:23.422
rebel spies are plotting
to set fire to New York,

04:23.424 --> 04:25.257
like they did
that town in Vermont.

04:25.259 --> 04:27.993
Well, the best way
to do that is

04:27.995 --> 04:29.495
with Greek fire.

04:29.497 --> 04:31.897
Are you accusing
the Major

04:31.899 --> 04:33.666
of being
a confederate spy?

04:33.668 --> 04:36.435
I did not say
that, Corky.

04:36.437 --> 04:38.137
Only, I remember
the day.

04:38.139 --> 04:39.605
Morehouse
lost his leg.

04:39.607 --> 04:40.940
He cursed both God
and Lincoln

04:40.942 --> 04:42.274
as I cut
through his flesh.

04:42.276 --> 04:43.776
If you'd have cut off
my leg without morphine,

04:43.778 --> 04:45.210
I'd have cursed God,
Abraham Lincoln,

04:45.212 --> 04:46.645
and my mother,

04:46.647 --> 04:48.147
but it wouldn't make me
turn against the Union.

04:48.149 --> 04:49.548
All I'm saying is
that a rich man

04:49.550 --> 04:52.217
like Robert Morehouse
can smuggle in enough

04:52.219 --> 04:56.455
inflammatory liquid to
torch the entire city.

04:56.457 --> 05:00.426
See, Corky,

05:00.428 --> 05:03.862
my Sara,

05:03.864 --> 05:05.631
she's with child.

05:05.633 --> 05:08.734
Well,
congratulations.

05:08.736 --> 05:09.969
That's
wonderful.

05:09.971 --> 05:11.904
How's she doing?

05:11.906 --> 05:15.074
She's... she's
healthy enough.

05:15.076 --> 05:17.076
She needs to get out
in fresh air more,

05:17.078 --> 05:18.877
amongst people,
so our child

05:18.879 --> 05:20.546
will be healthy
in her womb.

05:22.882 --> 05:25.951
Election day
is always trouble.

05:25.953 --> 05:27.987
The city burns?

05:27.989 --> 05:29.521
There's
another riot.

05:29.523 --> 05:32.491
Matthew, the riots
are behind us.

05:32.493 --> 05:34.193
Carmansville is
a long way away

05:34.195 --> 05:35.427
from any
election trouble.

05:35.429 --> 05:38.964
Go home, relax,
enjoy the day.

05:38.966 --> 05:43.469
Corky.

05:43.471 --> 05:47.373
We, um, found a body
up in Central Park.

05:49.042 --> 05:52.011
Mary Lockwood's
body.

05:52.013 --> 05:55.581
That's a bad piece
of luck.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.082
First, Molly.
Now, Mary.

05:57.084 --> 05:58.584
She was shot dead
through the heart.

05:58.586 --> 06:00.753
It must've been
a robbery.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.254
A robber wouldn't
have dragged Mary

06:02.256 --> 06:04.690
all the way up to
the park to bury her.

06:04.692 --> 06:06.659
Well, maybe she was
robbed <i>in</i> the park.

06:06.661 --> 06:09.061
Been thinking this
through, Kevin.

06:09.063 --> 06:12.631
Jeremiah McLean
killed Mary.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.767
McLean, who owns
the hardware store?

06:14.769 --> 06:16.235
Why would he?

06:16.237 --> 06:19.505
McLean was the man Mary was
running off to England with.

06:19.507 --> 06:21.006
She changed her mind.

06:21.008 --> 06:22.808
She decided
to come back to <i>me.</i>

06:22.810 --> 06:25.177
She told McLean and he
killed her. He should hang.

06:25.179 --> 06:27.579
Before we
string him up,

06:27.581 --> 06:29.014
I'll speak with him.

06:29.016 --> 06:30.749
You go home.

06:30.751 --> 06:32.084
Can't. The cap'n's
assigned me

06:32.086 --> 06:36.221
to protect
Alderman Reese today.

06:36.223 --> 06:38.924
Andrew.

06:38.926 --> 06:40.526
I can't help,
either.

06:40.528 --> 06:43.729
I'm supervising the
<i>official</i> balloting.

06:48.268 --> 06:50.736
Little Byrnes,
you'll come with me.

06:52.572 --> 06:54.406
Kevin told me not

06:54.408 --> 06:55.908
to leave the house
this morning.

06:55.910 --> 06:58.410
He said
the streets

06:58.412 --> 07:00.746
weren't safe
on election day.

07:00.748 --> 07:03.849
He's always
looking out for me.

07:06.753 --> 07:08.687
What do you think
of my dress?

07:08.689 --> 07:11.457
Very pretty.

07:11.459 --> 07:14.159
Kevin bought it
for me.

07:14.161 --> 07:16.428
New.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.530
Fancy, isn't it?

07:18.532 --> 07:21.266
This is
delicious.

07:21.268 --> 07:25.637
Yes, I'm a very
good cook.

07:25.639 --> 07:27.906
Kevin <i>loves</i>
<i>my cooking.</i>

07:31.511 --> 07:33.512
Since
I've been back,

07:33.514 --> 07:35.481
I've been eating
too much,

07:35.483 --> 07:38.050
but Kevin
doesn't mind.

07:38.052 --> 07:39.551
You know
how he likes

07:39.553 --> 07:41.120
a handful
when he sleeps.

07:43.156 --> 07:46.492
* hot corn,
all hot *

07:46.494 --> 07:47.960
* just come out of
the boiling pot! *

07:47.962 --> 07:49.161
Sim.

07:49.163 --> 07:51.463
You're open
on election day.

07:51.465 --> 07:52.965
Only 'til noon,
when the whiskey

07:52.967 --> 07:57.202
runs out at Eva's
saloon, then I hide.

07:57.204 --> 07:59.438
Well, I'm looking
for McLean.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.707
Went to his house.
No one's home.

08:01.709 --> 08:04.243
I haven't seen
Jeremiah for weeks.

08:04.245 --> 08:06.044
Said he had to leave
town, sudden.

08:06.046 --> 08:07.513
Didn't say
where or why

08:07.515 --> 08:09.448
or how long
he'd be gone.

08:09.450 --> 08:11.550
Your business partner
ups and goes

08:11.552 --> 08:13.452
and you
ain't curious?

08:13.454 --> 08:16.588
Well, Jeremiah isn't
the forthcoming sort.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.590
Morning, Sim.
Morning, Aloysius.

08:21.194 --> 08:22.861
Did he talk much about
his personal life,

08:22.863 --> 08:24.530
his marriage?

08:24.532 --> 08:26.665
I said not
forthcoming, right?

08:26.667 --> 08:28.400
So you have
no idea

08:28.402 --> 08:30.803
if he was having
an affair.

08:30.805 --> 08:33.238
Is that what this
is about?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.640
The metropolitan police
sends out not one,

08:35.643 --> 08:37.275
but two, detectives
the same day

08:37.278 --> 08:38.844
to check
on infidelity?

08:38.846 --> 08:40.913
Two detectives?
Who else was here?

08:40.914 --> 08:42.914
Maguire.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.117
He was here
a half an hour ago.

08:49.522 --> 08:50.889
All right,

08:50.891 --> 08:53.025
when McLean comes back,
you let me know.

08:53.027 --> 08:57.029
* hot corn!

08:57.031 --> 08:58.664
Lincoln would
have you believe

08:58.666 --> 09:01.867
that the negroid
is not only our equal,

09:01.869 --> 09:03.969
but that blending
the races

09:03.971 --> 09:06.839
creates a stronger
human species.

09:06.841 --> 09:09.908
This dangerous,
farfetched fantasy

09:09.910 --> 09:12.010
hides his true purpose,
to shove that

09:12.012 --> 09:14.680
big-government stick of
his down your throat.

09:14.682 --> 09:16.715
I don't see
Detective Maguire.

09:16.717 --> 09:18.250
Little Byrnes, go back
to the precinct

09:18.252 --> 09:19.751
and ask Captain Sullivan
to put a patrolman

09:19.753 --> 09:21.253
in front of
the hardware store

09:21.255 --> 09:22.754
and another
at McLean's house.

09:22.756 --> 09:23.956
Yes, sir!

09:23.958 --> 09:25.357
Take away your
hard-earned pay.

09:25.359 --> 09:27.292
They're not equal!

09:27.294 --> 09:30.295
Francis,
where in the hell?

09:33.099 --> 09:34.499
This her?

09:34.501 --> 09:36.068
Who?

09:36.070 --> 09:37.302
Mary Lockwood.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.579
"Female shot
Central Park".

09:47.581 --> 09:49.081
I need a favor,
Grimes.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.916
And you're asking <i>me?</i>
<i>Not likely.</i>

09:50.918 --> 09:53.485
I need the bullet
which killed Mary.

09:53.487 --> 09:55.387
Look, I don't work
for the city,

09:55.389 --> 09:58.490
I don't work for the
metropolitan police,

09:58.492 --> 10:00.759
and I certainly don't
work for Micks like you,

10:00.761 --> 10:03.762
so why don't you
toddle off

10:03.764 --> 10:05.831
and find a saloon.

10:10.303 --> 10:15.107
I asked nice.

10:15.109 --> 10:17.576
At bullet is part
of an official

10:17.578 --> 10:18.877
murder
investigation

10:18.879 --> 10:21.947
and I will have it!

10:21.949 --> 10:25.183
Unless you want to be
next on that table.

10:25.185 --> 10:29.254
I haven't started
the autopsy yet.

10:29.256 --> 10:31.056
Take about
half a day.

10:31.058 --> 10:32.491
First thing
tomorrow,

10:32.493 --> 10:34.626
I'll stop by,
get that bullet.

10:58.918 --> 11:01.386
Sleep well,
sweet Mary.

11:13.566 --> 11:16.201
I need $10,000.

11:16.203 --> 11:17.602
There's weaponry
and Greek fire

11:17.604 --> 11:18.837
arriving tonight.

11:18.839 --> 11:20.639
As we've discussed,
a lot of people

11:20.641 --> 11:22.307
along the way
expect to be paid.

11:22.309 --> 11:24.142
$10,000, today?

11:24.144 --> 11:26.278
If I were
to get you the money,

11:26.280 --> 11:27.779
how would this all
play out?

11:27.781 --> 11:29.548
You don't need
the specifics.

11:29.550 --> 11:30.983
Oh, I disagree.

11:30.985 --> 11:34.052
See, my cash,
my terms.

11:34.054 --> 11:36.455
Where and when will
the shipment arrive?

11:36.457 --> 11:38.991
I'll get you
that information

11:38.993 --> 11:41.360
when I receive
the monies.

11:41.362 --> 11:43.829
Sober or spirited,

11:43.831 --> 11:45.731
you are a difficult
one to read, Kennedy.

11:48.134 --> 11:51.837
Come back
at 10:00 tonight.

12:02.749 --> 12:04.082
Vote McClellan/
Tammany!

12:04.084 --> 12:05.417
Vote Lincoln/
Johnson!

12:05.419 --> 12:07.252
Vote McClellan/
Tammany!

12:07.254 --> 12:09.454
Your name?

12:09.456 --> 12:11.356
Finn, Michael.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.891
For McClellan?

12:12.893 --> 12:14.960
Okay, Mike, make your
mark, sign here.

12:24.404 --> 12:25.904
There you are.

12:25.906 --> 12:28.673
Take your free drink,
courtesy of Mr. Tweed.

12:28.675 --> 12:31.076
This time, your name
is Jack Morrison.

12:34.447 --> 12:36.581
That's not
going to do.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.351
Here.

12:39.353 --> 12:41.920
There we are.
All right.

12:41.922 --> 12:43.255
Tim Bayliss.

12:43.257 --> 12:46.858
Vote McClellan
and Tammany.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.693
Keep moving!

12:48.695 --> 12:51.463
We got an election
to win here!

12:51.465 --> 12:53.331
We are tabulating

12:53.333 --> 12:54.833
every drink,
you know.

12:54.835 --> 12:56.501
Boss Tweed
will foot the fare.

12:56.503 --> 12:58.904
Annie okay?

12:58.906 --> 13:00.338
Mrs. McDonagh
is with her now.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.074
The girl's out of
control, you know.

13:02.076 --> 13:03.942
She's got all sorts
of crazy ideas.

13:03.944 --> 13:06.211
Her and everybody
else around here.

13:06.213 --> 13:07.712
Have either of you
two seen Francis?

13:07.714 --> 13:09.314
No.

13:09.316 --> 13:11.616
Hey, Corky,

13:11.618 --> 13:14.086
you hear
any more rumors,

13:14.088 --> 13:18.356
about New York
getting detonated?

13:18.358 --> 13:20.058
Why do you ask?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.760
Sybil, of course.

13:21.762 --> 13:24.429
She's still harping on
about this secret telegram

13:24.431 --> 13:27.365
warning Mayor Gunther
of dire consequences.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.867
She's threatening
to move to Kentucky

13:28.869 --> 13:31.103
and I don't even know
where the hell Kentucky is.

13:31.105 --> 13:32.637
So tell me true,

13:32.639 --> 13:34.773
is there
anything brewing?

13:34.775 --> 13:36.007
Not sure.

13:36.009 --> 13:37.442
Could be nothing,

13:37.444 --> 13:39.544
could be the end
of the world.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.454
Corky, what
a lovely surprise.

13:49.456 --> 13:50.956
I was just thinking
about you.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.457
And me,
about you.

13:52.459 --> 13:54.526
Oh?

13:54.528 --> 13:57.529
You and a certain
business venture...

13:57.531 --> 13:59.931
Adam, have you
had luncheon?

13:59.933 --> 14:01.199
No, sir.

14:01.201 --> 14:03.368
To the kitchen,
then.

14:06.506 --> 14:09.074
You and a certain
business venture

14:09.076 --> 14:10.575
involving
Greek fire.

14:10.577 --> 14:12.110
Our friend Freeman.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.246
There are rumors
about Johnny Reb

14:14.248 --> 14:15.947
burning down
the city.

14:15.949 --> 14:18.083
The rumors are true.

14:18.085 --> 14:20.318
So you do know
what's going on?

14:24.257 --> 14:26.224
Why did you slice
Elizabeth's paintings?

14:26.226 --> 14:29.594
That has nothing
to do with the fact...

14:29.596 --> 14:31.630
She was terribly
frightened.

14:31.632 --> 14:33.165
Nothing to do
with the fact that

14:33.167 --> 14:35.167
you knew about an attack
on New York and haven't

14:35.169 --> 14:36.635
made a report to the
proper authorities.

14:36.637 --> 14:38.236
Who would I tell,
the Mayor,

14:38.238 --> 14:40.172
Governor Seymour,
the editor of

14:40.174 --> 14:41.640
the <i>New York daily news?</i>
<i>They're all copperheads.</i>

14:41.642 --> 14:43.942
Well, you could've told me.
And why would I tell you?

14:43.944 --> 14:45.810
When I don't know if
I can trust you anymore.

14:45.812 --> 14:47.712
Your behavior
towards Elizabeth...

14:47.714 --> 14:49.181
She sent Annie
to John Reilly's!

14:49.183 --> 14:50.582
She lied to me.

14:50.584 --> 14:52.384
She didn't know
what Reilly had done!

14:52.386 --> 14:54.319
She thought he was
the girl's father.

14:54.321 --> 14:56.021
But once she found
out the truth,

14:56.023 --> 14:58.423
she tried to handle
the situation by herself.

14:58.425 --> 14:59.791
She went up
to Reilly's

14:59.793 --> 15:01.893
to try to save
little Annie.

15:01.895 --> 15:04.896
Elizabeth cares for
the child's wellbeing,

15:04.898 --> 15:06.865
same as you.

15:06.867 --> 15:09.634
Yes, she should've
told all,

15:09.636 --> 15:11.102
but you can't bring
Five Points up here,

15:11.104 --> 15:12.871
where it
doesn't belong.

15:12.873 --> 15:16.107
You can't threaten
an innocent woman.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.180
Okay.

15:24.384 --> 15:25.650
Kevin...

15:28.321 --> 15:30.589
Elizabeth and I...

15:35.461 --> 15:39.397
Okay.

15:39.399 --> 15:41.099
The Greek fire.

15:44.003 --> 15:46.137
I've been
getting chummy

15:46.139 --> 15:48.373
with several
Southern radicals.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.841
They're bringing
the liquid in tonight,

15:49.843 --> 15:51.343
along with
some weapons,

15:51.345 --> 15:52.877
but they won't
move forward

15:52.879 --> 15:54.412
if Lincoln loses
the election.

15:54.414 --> 15:55.880
And if he wins,

15:55.882 --> 15:57.349
where will they
strike, when?

15:57.351 --> 15:58.817
I'm merely
a fountain of money,

15:58.819 --> 16:00.185
not privy to detail.

16:00.187 --> 16:02.020
Yet.

16:02.022 --> 16:05.657
I need the names
of the men involved.

16:05.659 --> 16:07.726
I only know two,
so far,

16:07.728 --> 16:10.829
but if you grab them
now the others

16:10.831 --> 16:13.365
will slither away
to strike another day.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.537
When you find out more,
you let me know.

16:19.539 --> 16:21.840
I'll give it
my consideration.

16:33.886 --> 16:35.387
You should send
Elizabeth

16:35.389 --> 16:36.755
a formal apology.

16:39.825 --> 16:42.327
I'll give it
my consideration.

16:48.510 --> 16:50.244
You're right about one
thing, Little Byrnes.

16:50.246 --> 16:52.380
Mary Lockwood was buried
where she dropped.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.150
The grave's shallow,

16:56.152 --> 16:57.685
which means
whoever dug it

16:57.687 --> 16:59.987
was acting quickly
to cover up the body.

16:59.989 --> 17:01.522
No one who was
thinking this through

17:01.524 --> 17:03.357
would've chosen this spot.
It's too public.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.601
Any idea how long
Mary Lockwood was dead

17:13.603 --> 17:15.102
before she was found?

17:15.104 --> 17:16.604
I can only guess.

17:16.606 --> 17:18.105
A few weeks,
at the most.

17:18.107 --> 17:20.107
Late October, then.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.609
Mm-hmm. Here,
for your pal Maguire.

17:22.612 --> 17:24.345
He's to come by tomorrow
and pick it up,

17:24.347 --> 17:26.012
but the further
you can keep him away

17:26.015 --> 17:28.516
from my hospital,
the better.

17:28.518 --> 17:31.619
A bullet?

17:31.621 --> 17:33.287
Straight from
Mary Lockwood's chest.

17:33.289 --> 17:34.622
Look, Corcoran,

17:34.624 --> 17:36.390
I don't need your guys
coming in here,

17:36.392 --> 17:37.625
threatening me.

17:37.627 --> 17:40.594
I'm a physician,
not some jailbird.

17:47.836 --> 17:49.804
Anything today,
Mrs. McLean?

17:49.806 --> 17:53.974
<i>Tribune!</i>
<i>Tri-bune! Tribune!</i>

17:53.976 --> 17:55.376
Vote today!

17:55.378 --> 17:58.579
Vote...

17:58.581 --> 18:01.949
<i>Tribune!</i>
<i>Tri-bune! Tribune!</i>

18:01.951 --> 18:05.252
Pray for us,
darling.

18:05.254 --> 18:07.054
McClellan...

18:07.056 --> 18:08.289
Ma'am.

18:10.292 --> 18:13.027
<i>Tribune!</i>
<i>Tri-bune!</i>

18:13.029 --> 18:14.628
Lincoln's an ape!

18:17.566 --> 18:19.066
Hey, Sim!

18:19.068 --> 18:21.202
See? That's why
I'm going home.

18:21.204 --> 18:23.437
Wait, I got a few
more questions.

18:23.439 --> 18:25.639
Did Maguire ask McLean
what kind of gun he owns?

18:25.641 --> 18:27.208
I don't know.

18:27.210 --> 18:28.809
Do you know what
kind of gun he owns?

18:28.811 --> 18:30.544
A Colt Navy revolver.

18:30.546 --> 18:33.314
It's got an engraving
of a battle on it.

18:33.316 --> 18:34.748
The gun's top rail.

18:37.252 --> 18:39.086
Go to
McLean's house.

18:39.088 --> 18:40.754
Relieve the
patrolman there.

18:57.339 --> 18:59.473
Finished with
Alderman Reese?

18:59.475 --> 19:00.975
Aye.

19:00.977 --> 19:03.277
He's home,
safe and sound.

19:08.383 --> 19:09.617
What?

19:09.619 --> 19:12.720
I saw
the Alderman.

19:12.722 --> 19:14.355
You were nowhere
in sight.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.728
You want to tell me
what's going on?

19:23.098 --> 19:24.698
I thought we agreed

19:24.700 --> 19:27.001
that I would be
the lead on this case,

19:27.003 --> 19:28.536
and you're undermining
my every move,

19:28.538 --> 19:30.104
so either you let me
do my job...

19:30.106 --> 19:31.272
Or what?

19:31.274 --> 19:33.040
You're taking
too goddamn long.

19:39.114 --> 19:42.416
McLean's back.

19:44.719 --> 19:46.186
And I'm going to be
the one to talk to him.

19:47.956 --> 19:49.823
Piss off, Corky.

19:49.825 --> 19:52.459
Mary's death
is his doing.

19:52.461 --> 19:53.961
The bastard
has to pay

19:53.963 --> 19:55.963
and I'm going to
see he does.

19:55.965 --> 19:58.032
No, you're
staying here!

19:58.034 --> 20:00.534
Don't be treating me
like I'm some lunatic!

20:00.536 --> 20:02.036
Since the day you came
back from the war,

20:02.038 --> 20:03.537
you've been
out of control,

20:03.539 --> 20:05.039
running through
the streets,

20:05.041 --> 20:06.774
desperate for answers,
for justice!

20:06.776 --> 20:08.275
Yes, and you've been
there to help me

20:08.277 --> 20:10.844
and, now, I want
to help you!

20:10.846 --> 20:12.913
I promise I won't
cause a fuss, Kevin,

20:12.915 --> 20:14.515
but I need
to see the man,

20:14.517 --> 20:16.083
just like you needed
to see McClaugherty.

20:16.085 --> 20:18.285
And the locket.

20:34.836 --> 20:39.607
All right,
we'll go together,

20:39.609 --> 20:43.243
see what
he has to say,

20:43.245 --> 20:45.112
then we decide what
the next step is.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.621
Well.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.623
McLean.
He's gone again.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.191
Why didn't you
follow him?

20:57.193 --> 20:58.559
My orders were
to stay here.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.394
Detective O'Brien made
himself very clear...

21:00.396 --> 21:02.463
I'm given an order,
I follow the order.

21:02.465 --> 21:03.897
No thinking
on my own.

21:03.899 --> 21:05.332
Let's divide up
three ways

21:05.334 --> 21:06.734
and scour
the neighborhood.

21:06.736 --> 21:09.203
No, we wait.

21:10.239 --> 21:13.407
We wait.

21:19.314 --> 21:21.548
Hey!
Easy, Francis!

21:21.550 --> 21:22.983
He hasn't been on
the force three weeks.

21:22.985 --> 21:24.418
He was just
following orders.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.786
He's a mindless twit
and he's got

21:25.788 --> 21:27.187
no business being
on this force,

21:27.189 --> 21:29.189
or any force,
just like his Uncle!

21:29.191 --> 21:30.224
Detectives.

21:30.226 --> 21:31.892
Shite!

21:31.894 --> 21:34.328
McLean! There's no use running!

21:43.238 --> 21:45.072
- Detective.
- Get him, coppers!

21:45.074 --> 21:47.374
McLean!

21:47.376 --> 21:48.842
Get your ass
back here!

21:57.452 --> 21:59.053
Christ, Francis!

21:59.055 --> 22:00.654
He ran.

22:00.656 --> 22:02.189
The guilty ones
always do.

22:02.191 --> 22:04.224
That proves he's
a murderous shit.

22:04.226 --> 22:06.527
Goddamn it! We agreed
to talk to him!

22:06.529 --> 22:08.062
Is that what you'd do with
Maggie's murderer, huh?!

22:08.064 --> 22:10.397
He killed Mary.
I know he did.

22:10.399 --> 22:13.267
In me bones.

22:13.269 --> 22:14.802
I closed the case

22:14.804 --> 22:16.270
and saved the city
of New York

22:16.272 --> 22:19.440
the cost
of a trial.

22:38.297 --> 22:40.195
This is Francis we're
talking about, here.

22:40.197 --> 22:41.696
He got McLean,
fair and square.

22:41.698 --> 22:43.198
What more
do you need?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.367
Something
don't sit right.

22:45.369 --> 22:47.602
Nothing sits right with
you these days, Kevin.

22:47.604 --> 22:49.070
If I could've talked
with McLean,

22:49.072 --> 22:51.439
I might've...
I don't know.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.175
Andrew, did you
know McLean at all?

22:54.177 --> 22:56.044
Only for good-
mornings and such.

22:56.046 --> 22:58.313
Then I'll have to
have a chat

22:58.315 --> 23:00.215
with the one
that knew him best.

23:00.217 --> 23:02.450
There's worse husbands
than Jeremiah McLean.

23:02.452 --> 23:05.120
Sure, he had his secrets,
cheap as could be,

23:05.122 --> 23:07.522
and he'd raise a hand
to me, time to time.

23:07.524 --> 23:08.957
He ever talk
about leaving,

23:08.959 --> 23:10.392
going to England?

23:10.394 --> 23:11.860
On a boat?

23:11.862 --> 23:13.595
He'd get seasick, just
standing on the beach.

23:13.597 --> 23:15.430
Where's he been
the past few weeks?

23:15.432 --> 23:16.931
Up in Buffalo
with his mother.

23:16.933 --> 23:19.634
She fell down the
stairs, can't walk.

23:19.636 --> 23:21.036
He's her only son.

23:21.038 --> 23:22.504
Huh.

23:24.675 --> 23:28.376
You ever hear of
Mary Lockwood?

23:28.378 --> 23:30.478
I should go clean.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.980
People are coming
for the wake.

23:31.982 --> 23:34.616
She died
a few weeks ago.

23:34.618 --> 23:37.118
Yeah, I heard,
up in Central Park.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.620
Abortion
doctor's sister.

23:38.622 --> 23:40.121
You have any
dealings with her?

23:40.123 --> 23:44.125
Who, the abortion
doctor or her sister?

23:44.127 --> 23:45.126
Either.

23:45.128 --> 23:46.127
No.

23:46.129 --> 23:47.228
Did your husband?

23:47.230 --> 23:49.097
I really should
go clean.

23:49.099 --> 23:50.832
See, in
detective-speak,

23:50.834 --> 23:52.300
you just said
"yes, Jeremiah

23:52.302 --> 23:55.737
"did know them,
but he's dead,

23:55.739 --> 23:58.406
so what difference
does it make?"

24:02.478 --> 24:04.312
Jeremiah got some
filly knocked up,

24:04.314 --> 24:05.814
had her fixed.

24:05.816 --> 24:08.149
This woman,
this Mary,

24:08.151 --> 24:10.652
said she had proof,
a book of some sort.

24:10.654 --> 24:12.454
What kind of book?

24:12.456 --> 24:13.955
I don't know,
a record,

24:13.957 --> 24:16.057
a ledger,
or something.

24:16.059 --> 24:17.125
A ledger?

24:17.127 --> 24:18.493
She wanted money,

24:18.495 --> 24:20.762
or she said she'd
come blabbing to me.

24:20.764 --> 24:23.164
Jeremiah
was such a miser,

24:23.166 --> 24:25.633
he'd rather I knew
than split with a penny.

24:25.635 --> 24:29.270
So why did he beat
Mary Lockwood?

24:29.272 --> 24:32.574
He was a man,
angry whenever forced

24:32.576 --> 24:34.247
to face
who he really was.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.419
So there's
no invasion,

24:44.421 --> 24:46.554
no bombs, nothing
to worry about?

24:46.556 --> 24:50.325
Not a thing.

24:50.327 --> 24:52.227
Oh, Jesus,
lord help us.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.028
What's
the matter now?

24:54.030 --> 24:56.431
You don't think
I believe you, do you?

24:56.433 --> 24:58.133
And you lying
to me means

24:58.135 --> 24:59.400
the situation's
worse than I expected.

24:59.402 --> 25:01.569
No, Sybil!
It's not...

25:01.571 --> 25:03.104
Where
are you going?

25:03.106 --> 25:07.342
To pack!
For Kentucky!

25:11.781 --> 25:14.015
But men and women
exist

25:14.017 --> 25:15.717
in separate
spheres.

25:15.719 --> 25:17.986
Men's job is
to run the nation.

25:17.988 --> 25:19.754
A woman's job is
to run the household.

25:19.756 --> 25:22.357
And the household isn't
part of the nation?

25:22.359 --> 25:24.359
You see, this is
a prime example

25:24.361 --> 25:26.094
of why women shouldn't
have the vote.

25:26.096 --> 25:28.296
You don't have
the grasp of politics.

25:28.298 --> 25:30.165
To quote Reverend
Antoinette Brown,

25:30.167 --> 25:32.233
"if a woman's sole
responsibility is

25:32.235 --> 25:33.835
"of the domestic type,
one class

25:33.837 --> 25:36.404
"will be crushed by it;
And the other,

25:36.406 --> 25:38.573
throw it off as
a badge of poverty."

25:38.575 --> 25:40.341
Rubbish.

25:40.343 --> 25:42.443
Elizabeth, I'm afraid you
won't get far with father.

25:42.445 --> 25:44.212
He's won.

25:44.214 --> 25:47.315
It's Lincoln, sir,
by an estimated

25:47.317 --> 25:48.650
400,000 votes.

25:52.888 --> 25:54.088
He's won.

25:56.393 --> 25:57.759
Send a message
to Falk and Prime

25:57.761 --> 25:59.761
at the Commercial
Bank of Hoboken.

25:59.763 --> 26:01.296
Now the results are in,
I should be leaving.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.665
Union war bonds.
"Dear sirs"...

26:03.667 --> 26:05.333
Mr. Morehouse,
thank you so much

26:05.335 --> 26:06.668
for your hospitality.

26:06.670 --> 26:08.603
Yes, yes,
Mrs. Haverford.

26:08.605 --> 26:10.471
Goodbye.
Where was I?

26:10.473 --> 26:13.441
A triumphant
night.

26:13.443 --> 26:15.043
And, yet,
a troubling one.

26:15.045 --> 26:16.511
Yes.

26:16.513 --> 26:18.279
The war
may soon be over,

26:18.281 --> 26:20.682
but the fighting
won't end.

26:20.684 --> 26:23.017
Half a million
dead.

26:23.019 --> 26:25.954
Is emancipation
really worth

26:25.956 --> 26:27.455
all the lives lost?

26:27.457 --> 26:29.924
Are you advocating
slavery?

26:29.926 --> 26:32.227
Of course not.

26:32.229 --> 26:33.728
In England,
we abolished

26:33.730 --> 26:35.230
the slave trade
ages ago.

26:35.232 --> 26:36.731
But does
your government

26:36.733 --> 26:38.566
truly believe that,
by creating a law,

26:38.568 --> 26:40.235
your citizens
will suddenly

26:40.237 --> 26:42.403
embrace
social equality?

26:43.607 --> 26:45.106
Personally, I find it
hard to believe

26:45.108 --> 26:46.608
that the Irish
will ever

26:46.610 --> 26:48.109
allow the negro
to be their equal.

26:48.111 --> 26:49.510
Men can change.

26:49.512 --> 26:52.847
Look at Corcoran.

26:52.849 --> 26:54.582
He believes the negro
to be his equal.

26:54.584 --> 26:56.918
I'd rather not discuss
Detective Corcoran.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.653
He's a good man

26:58.655 --> 27:00.555
who did an
irrational thing,

27:00.557 --> 27:03.157
acting out of
passion and impulse.

27:03.159 --> 27:06.194
Valuable traits
in war, I suppose.

27:06.196 --> 27:08.730
And in
police work.

27:08.732 --> 27:12.867
I've talked to him,
explained.

27:12.869 --> 27:15.169
He is of no danger
to you.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.273
I've got it,

27:18.275 --> 27:20.275
James!

27:20.277 --> 27:22.310
There's a satchel
in my bedroom.

27:22.312 --> 27:24.646
Grab it for me,
would you?

27:24.648 --> 27:26.581
And my coat.

27:40.262 --> 27:42.497
Elizabeth, this
won't take long.

27:49.338 --> 27:52.040
You've heard the
election results?

27:52.042 --> 27:53.107
Yes.

27:53.109 --> 27:56.210
New York will burn.

27:56.212 --> 27:57.712
I'm not giving you
the money

27:57.714 --> 27:59.280
until you tell me more
about your plan.

27:59.282 --> 28:01.049
Better yet,

28:01.051 --> 28:03.584
why don't I
show you?

28:03.586 --> 28:05.286
You'll travel
along tonight.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.524
Let me get
the funds

28:09.526 --> 28:10.858
and say farewell
to my guest.

28:10.860 --> 28:12.727
Mm-hmm.

28:21.356 --> 28:23.824
Evening, fellas.

28:23.826 --> 28:29.096
This here's
Robert Morehouse.

28:29.098 --> 28:32.767
I'd like you to meet
Headley, Martin.

28:32.769 --> 28:34.001
You already know
James McMaster.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.569
Gentlemen.

28:35.571 --> 28:37.038
Evening.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.641
Steady the horses,
will you?

28:40.643 --> 28:42.443
All right, men,
let's get to it.

28:42.445 --> 28:44.245
Are you sure you
can trust these men?

28:44.247 --> 28:49.250
They are my brothers
in battle.

28:51.153 --> 28:52.687
Careful, now.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.722
We don't want
any accidents.

28:54.724 --> 28:57.792
Remember,
any of this juice

28:57.794 --> 28:59.927
gets exposed to the
air, we're done for.

29:08.671 --> 29:11.672
Mary Lockwood was the
fraud I thought she was.

29:11.674 --> 29:15.543
She had her sister's
ledger all along.

29:15.545 --> 29:19.080
Did Maguire know
about that?

29:19.082 --> 29:21.315
The girls and I
are going dancing

29:21.317 --> 29:23.818
at Harry Hill's.
You want to join us?

29:23.820 --> 29:26.053
Francis, he said
that Mary and McLean,

29:26.055 --> 29:27.655
they ran away together.
Why would he lie?

29:29.691 --> 29:31.325
Poor Maguire.

29:31.327 --> 29:34.895
He's had such
bad run of luck,

29:34.897 --> 29:38.399
losing two fiancées.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.469
Course,
he's a rough one,

29:41.471 --> 29:43.571
when he gets
whiskeyed up.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.407
He and Molly...

29:46.409 --> 29:49.877
what about
he and Molly?

29:49.879 --> 29:54.882
Molly was afraid
of Maguire.

29:54.884 --> 29:56.917
He throttled her
once, so,

29:56.919 --> 29:59.687
she was scared that he
would hurt her again.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.288
I don't know,
maybe that's why

30:01.290 --> 30:03.824
she said yes
to the marriage.

30:03.826 --> 30:05.926
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

30:05.928 --> 30:07.428
Because,
in my profession,

30:07.430 --> 30:09.030
one learns <i>not</i>
<i>to say</i>

30:09.032 --> 30:10.464
what goes on between
a man and a woman.

30:12.534 --> 30:13.934
I don't want to add
to your troubles,

30:13.936 --> 30:17.805
but you got to do
something about Annie.

30:17.807 --> 30:20.741
She confided in me that
you sleep with her?

30:20.743 --> 30:22.309
That's absurd.

30:22.311 --> 30:23.611
I know.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.312
That girl's mind is still
bent from her past.

30:25.314 --> 30:27.581
Enough is enough.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.116
You might think
seriously

30:29.118 --> 30:31.052
about giving her
to the nuns.

30:35.590 --> 30:37.658
Almost there, men.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.894
Just three more
and we're headed South.

30:39.896 --> 30:43.264
Three more
to go, boys.

30:43.266 --> 30:46.000
Careful.

30:46.002 --> 30:48.502
Here we go.

30:48.504 --> 30:50.571
Hold this end.
Don't drop that!

30:58.447 --> 31:02.416
Careful.
Be careful with that.

31:02.418 --> 31:05.820
There you go.
All right.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.555
What have we got,
two more?

31:09.291 --> 31:11.258
Come on.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.394
Let's get it done.

31:15.964 --> 31:18.099
Careful.

31:18.101 --> 31:20.468
Watch your end,
now!

31:20.470 --> 31:25.206
All right.

31:25.208 --> 31:26.807
Mr. Morehouse!

31:26.809 --> 31:28.542
Bring the money.

31:28.544 --> 31:30.111
Let's
have a drink.

31:45.026 --> 31:46.060
James,

31:46.062 --> 31:47.661
it's been
a pleasure.

31:53.935 --> 31:55.236
Let's ride.

32:13.922 --> 32:15.322
Come on.
Hyah!

32:15.324 --> 32:17.558
* So beautiful
and long *

32:17.560 --> 32:20.094
* I thought
that she loved me *

32:20.096 --> 32:21.762
* but I found
I was wrong *

32:21.764 --> 32:25.266
* she was beautiful
as a butterfly *

32:25.268 --> 32:27.501
* and proud
as a queen *

32:28.938 --> 32:30.871
Why are you grinning
like an idiot?

32:30.873 --> 32:32.740
Where
on God's earth

32:32.742 --> 32:34.208
did you learn
that song?

32:34.210 --> 32:37.478
Hmm, I have a few
surprises left,

32:37.480 --> 32:38.712
Dr. Freeman.

32:38.714 --> 32:39.713
Ah!

32:39.715 --> 32:40.748
Hmm.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.521
It's all right.
It's all right.

32:57.199 --> 32:59.133
Freeman, I need
your opinion.

33:07.542 --> 33:09.810
My opinion is
he's dead.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.181
Now, this is
the bullet

33:14.183 --> 33:15.549
that killed
Mary Lockwood.

33:15.551 --> 33:16.850
Could the same
kind of bullet,

33:16.852 --> 33:19.286
from the same kind of
gun, have killed McLean?

33:19.288 --> 33:21.622
That's going to take some
specialized equipment.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.624
I don't think I could be
certain by sight.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.426
Well, it's
an unusual bullet,

33:25.428 --> 33:27.728
not from a Colt
or a Remington.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.230
Well,
you're lucky.

33:29.232 --> 33:30.664
It's not deformed.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.266
It must not have
hit any bones.

33:32.268 --> 33:35.402
Tearshaped, with
a Ridge at the base.

33:35.404 --> 33:36.604
Hmm.

33:36.606 --> 33:38.906
Do you have the bullet
that killed McLean?

33:38.908 --> 33:42.276
Not yet.

33:42.278 --> 33:45.079
Ah.

33:45.081 --> 33:47.081
Hmm.

33:52.554 --> 33:54.021
Did you find out
anything

33:54.023 --> 33:55.456
about the
Greek fire?

33:55.458 --> 33:57.524
Not much.

34:20.649 --> 34:22.850
Okay,

34:22.851 --> 34:26.186
here she comes.

34:26.188 --> 34:30.157
Oh, not as lucky
as the first.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.425
It's deformed.

34:31.427 --> 34:33.661
It must've hit
a rib.

34:33.663 --> 34:36.130
But no. See?

34:36.132 --> 34:37.965
Same shape
as the first.

34:37.967 --> 34:41.001
Ridge
at the base.

34:41.003 --> 34:42.503
Hmm, you're right,
you don't see

34:42.505 --> 34:46.507
too many bullets
like this.

34:46.509 --> 34:48.007
Do you know
who owns a gun

34:48.010 --> 34:49.810
who shoots this
type of bullet?

35:04.159 --> 35:07.227
Which one is
Detective Maguire's window?

35:07.229 --> 35:08.796
The lamp's just gone out,
so he's in for the night.

35:08.798 --> 35:10.764
You stay here,
awake and alert.

35:10.766 --> 35:12.666
If Maguire comes out,
you follow him.

35:12.668 --> 35:15.169
If he goes anywhere out of
the norm, come get me.

35:15.171 --> 35:16.737
Yes, sir.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.972
What, exactly, do we suspect
Detective Maguire of doing?

35:18.974 --> 35:21.709
I'm not
sure, myself.

35:21.711 --> 35:23.243
You think you know
someone... hell,

35:23.245 --> 35:24.712
you think you know
yourself, but sometimes,

35:24.714 --> 35:27.181
Little Byrnes, you find
that neither is true.

35:27.183 --> 35:28.882
Please don't call me
"Little Byrnes" anymore.

35:28.884 --> 35:32.252
What do you want me
to call you?

35:32.254 --> 35:34.588
Phinbar is
my Christian name.

35:34.590 --> 35:38.992
And a right fine
name it is.

36:06.855 --> 36:08.922
What's the matter with
this damned beast?

36:08.924 --> 36:11.392
It seems
to be lame.

36:11.394 --> 36:13.060
Goddamn it! We cannot
afford a delay.

36:13.062 --> 36:16.063
I'll take a look.

36:16.065 --> 36:17.464
Here, I'll
lend a hand.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.834
Whoa, whoa.

36:35.250 --> 36:36.316
Ah! Ooh!

36:36.318 --> 36:38.118
You all right?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.920
Ah! Yeah,
this cursed leg.

36:39.922 --> 36:41.922
How fares the horse?

36:41.924 --> 36:43.957
Front shoe's
come undone.

36:43.959 --> 36:47.661
Here, it's easier
if we untie them first.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.163
Robert,
the wagon!

36:49.165 --> 36:51.165
Robert, the wagon!

36:51.167 --> 36:53.233
Oh, my God.
Hyah!

37:02.243 --> 37:05.212
Go!

37:14.056 --> 37:15.456
Son of a...

37:18.694 --> 37:21.895
That's our
entire stock.

37:21.897 --> 37:23.697
Months of planning,

37:23.699 --> 37:26.533
thousands
of dollars.

37:26.535 --> 37:29.303
What are we
going to do?!

37:29.305 --> 37:31.004
Little,
as of now.

37:31.006 --> 37:34.374
But at least
we know it works.

37:47.077 --> 37:52.047
<i>Times! Times!</i>
Get your <i>Times!</i>

37:52.049 --> 37:54.716
Lincoln wins!

37:54.718 --> 37:56.819
Get your <i>Times!</i>

38:10.667 --> 38:12.701
I'll have breakfast
ready in a moment.

38:15.605 --> 38:18.173
Why don't you soak
the night off?

38:24.314 --> 38:25.681
I added a little
rosewater

38:25.683 --> 38:27.182
so this would
smell nice.

38:27.184 --> 38:29.451
Annie, stop.

38:29.453 --> 38:30.853
Stop what?

38:30.855 --> 38:33.222
Making this place a home,
pretending to be

38:33.224 --> 38:34.723
something that
you'll never be.

38:34.725 --> 38:36.024
Not to me,
at least.

38:36.026 --> 38:38.026
Now, I want you
in school,

38:38.028 --> 38:39.595
at St. Brenda's
convent.

38:39.597 --> 38:42.030
You're sending
me away?

38:42.032 --> 38:43.398
Well, no, you can stay
here until the nuns

38:43.400 --> 38:44.800
find the right
place for you.

38:44.802 --> 38:46.368
But, Corky, you know...
No more talking!

38:46.370 --> 38:48.937
Go upstairs and get out
of my wife's clothes.

38:53.677 --> 38:54.843
Annie!

39:00.517 --> 39:02.451
Morning,
Detective.

39:02.453 --> 39:03.652
Maguire
on the move?

39:03.654 --> 39:05.320
Yes, sir. Before dawn,
he was up and out,

39:05.322 --> 39:06.822
all the way
to 22nd Street.

39:06.824 --> 39:08.423
He was wearing a tie
and carrying flowers.

39:08.425 --> 39:09.658
To where?

39:09.660 --> 39:11.460
The Earle house, sir.
That place is

39:11.462 --> 39:15.764
chock-a-block
with batty women.

39:15.766 --> 39:17.332
Has he come out
of the Earle house?

39:17.334 --> 39:18.934
About 20 minutes
after he went inside.

39:18.936 --> 39:21.270
Stay here.
Watch after Annie.

39:21.272 --> 39:23.172
Have some breakfast.
That's an order.

39:23.174 --> 39:24.406
Yes, sir.

39:42.225 --> 39:44.526
Afternoon, sir.

39:44.528 --> 39:45.894
The name's
Corcoran.

39:45.896 --> 39:47.262
Hello,
Mr. Corcoran.

39:47.264 --> 39:49.598
Detective Corcoran.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.099
Oh.

39:51.101 --> 39:52.401
Well, what can I do
for you, Detective?

39:52.403 --> 39:54.303
Early this morning,
a man

39:54.305 --> 39:56.305
named Francis Maguire
entered this building.

39:56.307 --> 39:58.774
I'm sorry,
Detective,

39:58.776 --> 40:00.142
we have strict
regulations.

40:00.144 --> 40:01.577
What was Mr. Maguire
doing here?

40:01.579 --> 40:04.179
As I was going to
say, Detective, here

40:04.181 --> 40:05.681
at the Earle house,
we don't...

40:05.683 --> 40:07.382
I understand,
ma'am, I do,

40:07.384 --> 40:08.884
but here's
the thing...

40:08.886 --> 40:10.652
I ain't leaving
'til I get an answer.

40:14.224 --> 40:16.558
I'll call the guard.

40:17.828 --> 40:19.428
You do what
you need to do.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.896
So will I.

40:20.898 --> 40:22.097
Guard!

40:22.099 --> 40:23.265
<i>Guard!</i>

40:23.267 --> 40:25.300
Eh!

40:25.302 --> 40:27.936
Aah!

40:27.938 --> 40:29.871
Hey! Hold it!

40:32.275 --> 40:33.375
Aah!

40:33.377 --> 40:35.110
Now I'll ask
once more.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.413
What was Mr. Maguire
doing here?

40:38.415 --> 40:40.882
Seeing Mrs. Maguire.

40:40.884 --> 40:43.151
His mother?

40:43.153 --> 40:45.320
No, no,
his wife.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.369
Mrs. Maguire.

41:05.742 --> 41:09.244
That's...
that's not her.

42:00.029 --> 42:02.564
Do you not
know me?

42:11.240 --> 42:12.741
You do know me.

42:18.381 --> 42:21.583
Tell me you know me,
please.

42:26.322 --> 42:27.823
Please.

42:38.802 --> 42:41.770
Remember?

42:41.772 --> 42:45.140
Remember me,

42:45.142 --> 42:46.975
Ellen?

42:50.047 --> 42:53.949
Remember me?

43:30.654 --> 43:33.714
Sync and correction by GeirDM

43:34.357 --> 43:36.158
how is
Corcoran's wife?

43:36.160 --> 43:38.560
I need Ellen to talk
now, Matthew.

43:38.562 --> 43:40.328
She will talk,
soon.

43:40.330 --> 43:41.863
May I present
messieurs

43:41.865 --> 43:45.066
Edwin, Junius Brutus,
and John Wilkes Booth?

43:45.068 --> 43:47.569
All three Booth brothers
onstage at the same time.

43:47.571 --> 43:49.471
You speak of
criminal activities.

43:49.473 --> 43:51.640
Tell me why I'm here. Truly this
is none of your concern, Robert.

43:51.642 --> 43:53.608
I don't
believe you.

43:53.610 --> 43:55.110
Maguire's vanished.

43:55.112 --> 43:57.179
I don't care how close
you are to this case.

43:57.181 --> 43:59.080
You understand me?
No, sir.

43:59.082 --> 44:01.383
Where's he hiding?

44:02.305 --> 44:08.641
