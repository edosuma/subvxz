WEBVTT

00:00.752 --> 00:02.212
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.420 --> 00:04.673
My brother is
on the wrong side.

00:06.132 --> 00:07.258
O., I am so sorry.

00:07.467 --> 00:09.052
Uh!

00:09.260 --> 00:10.428
You're dead to me.

00:11.805 --> 00:13.181
You wanted
your memories back.

00:13.348 --> 00:14.766
Here they are.

00:14.975 --> 00:17.811
Aah! No! I submit!

00:18.019 --> 00:19.145
I want
to talk to raven.

00:19.354 --> 00:20.897
Raven's in
the city of light.

00:21.106 --> 00:23.024
No. No, no, no, no, no!
No! Stop!

00:23.233 --> 00:24.859
If you want
to save raven,

00:25.026 --> 00:27.570
all you have to do
is take the key.

00:30.532 --> 00:31.700
He's taking raven.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.119
Find Jasper Jordan.
Bring him here.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.748
Clarke.

00:38.957 --> 00:40.166
Get in!

00:43.962 --> 00:45.338
Mom.

00:45.547 --> 00:46.881
As soon
as raven wakes

00:47.090 --> 00:49.968
and I see her surroundings,
we will find them.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.428
When we do,
we'll find

00:51.636 --> 00:52.679
the rest of
their friends.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.556
Now that Arkadia
has fallen,

00:54.764 --> 00:57.559
we'll move on
to stage two.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.408
Jasper, please
talk to me.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.452
I saved your life.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.579
It's more
than you deserve.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.627
My mother let them
shoot at me.

01:24.836 --> 01:27.005
I can see
the appeal.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.382
Stop talking and
look for the cave.

01:29.591 --> 01:31.384
Sinclair
said it would be

01:31.593 --> 01:33.511
around here
somewhere.

01:35.346 --> 01:36.765
I don't
understand it, either.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.767
It's something
about those chips.

01:38.975 --> 01:41.770
We'll know
soon enough. Be ready.

01:44.355 --> 01:47.358
O., wait.
You can't just leave.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.069
Watch me.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.695
You heard what Jasper
said on the radio.

01:50.904 --> 01:52.113
Arkadia is not safe.

01:52.322 --> 01:54.199
What Jasper said
sounds insane.

01:54.407 --> 01:58.328
Pike's gone.
I can handle myself.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.622
Grounders
burn their dead.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.041
I know that,
and then what?

02:03.249 --> 02:04.125
Where you gonna go?

02:04.334 --> 02:06.127
You don't get
to ask me that.

02:06.336 --> 02:07.670
What more do I have
to do to prove

02:07.879 --> 02:09.839
that I am
on your side?

02:10.048 --> 02:13.093
Bring Lincoln back.

02:15.637 --> 02:17.722
Turning pike in
does not make you

02:17.931 --> 02:20.100
one of the good guys,
Bellamy.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.560
You did that
to save me,

02:22.769 --> 02:24.062
not because what you
thought pike was doing

02:24.270 --> 02:25.647
to the grounders
was wrong.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.941
The grounders were
starving us out.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.400
Because you
massacred an army

02:29.609 --> 02:30.443
that was sent
to protect us.

02:30.652 --> 02:31.945
That army
could've attacked us

02:32.153 --> 02:33.196
at any time,
and you know it.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.782
But they didn't attack.
You did that.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.118
You were hurting,
and you lashed out

02:38.326 --> 02:40.745
because that's
what you do.

02:40.954 --> 02:42.330
There are
consequences, bell.

02:42.539 --> 02:44.916
People get hurt.

02:45.125 --> 02:48.294
People die,
your people.

02:48.503 --> 02:52.215
Monroe's dead.
Lincoln is dead.

02:56.136 --> 02:57.887
Eh...

03:11.401 --> 03:13.361
They're here.

03:22.871 --> 03:25.415
Need your help!

03:25.623 --> 03:27.750
We have to get her inside
before she wakes up.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.253
Were you followed?

03:30.461 --> 03:32.714
Maybe.
I--I don't know.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.508
Give her here.

03:35.717 --> 03:36.676
Get to the Ridge.

03:36.885 --> 03:37.844
Radio if you spot
anyone following.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.971
Harper, we'll stay
here on watch.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.810
Octavia, come on.
We need you.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.191
Clear some space.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.278
What the hell
happened to her?

03:55.486 --> 03:57.030
I told you
on the radio.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.782
Raven is not raven anymore.
None of them are.

03:59.991 --> 04:02.202
Jaha has been
chipping everyone.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.828
Jasper's right.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.663
I don't need
your help, all right?

04:05.872 --> 04:07.874
Just take it easy
and explain.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.793
Jaha is using the chips
to control everyone.

04:11.002 --> 04:12.712
You swallow it,
and it changes you.

04:12.921 --> 04:14.088
You forget who you are,
and then you see

04:14.297 --> 04:17.467
this thing Alie, only
she's not really there.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.053
She made raven
slit her own wrists.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.679
She was trying to get it
out of her head.

04:21.888 --> 04:22.847
I was trying
to help her, but--

04:23.056 --> 04:24.432
OK, so
let's help her now.

04:24.641 --> 04:25.683
Did she say how?

04:25.892 --> 04:27.477
She was working
on building something.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.811
She needed one of our
old wristbands,

04:29.020 --> 04:30.688
but Jaha destroyed
all of them.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.899
Wait a second.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.446
Does it look like this?

04:39.572 --> 04:40.823
There it is...

04:41.032 --> 04:41.824
Not exactly.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.952
Version two
of my program.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.247
Find out
where you are now.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.998
- Uh! Uh!
- Ooh!

04:49.207 --> 04:51.501
Don't
let her get away!

04:51.709 --> 04:52.835
Hey!

04:53.044 --> 04:55.255
It's just woods.
I can't see anything. No.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.174
I need to know
your location.

04:58.383 --> 04:59.509
Find a landmark.

04:59.717 --> 05:00.843
Ah! Let me go!

05:01.052 --> 05:02.011
If raven
finds out where we are,

05:02.220 --> 05:03.221
so will Alie.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.139
She'll come for her.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.225
Aah!

05:07.433 --> 05:10.979
Reaper stick,
last dose.

05:12.105 --> 05:13.398
We have to go.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.150
Why? Alie doesn't
know where we are.

05:16.359 --> 05:19.654
Because I know where
we can get a wristband.

06:11.164 --> 06:12.707
I'll talk to her.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.959
I'll go with you.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.343
I thought you said
she was a friend.

06:24.594 --> 06:27.722
We'll handle it.
Just stay here.

06:33.061 --> 06:35.229
Skaikru is not
welcome here, Wanheda.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.565
Niylah, what's wrong?

06:37.774 --> 06:39.025
She's waking up! Hurry.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.943
We have to get her inside.

06:41.152 --> 06:42.487
Is your father here?

06:42.695 --> 06:44.655
My father's dead,
part of an army

06:44.864 --> 06:47.408
killed by your people
while trying to protect you.

06:49.077 --> 06:51.162
- Niylah, please.
- I said no.

06:51.371 --> 06:54.957
We haven't got
time for this. Move. Move!

06:56.501 --> 06:58.211
Get her in there.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.004
I told you,
my mom was here.

07:00.213 --> 07:01.464
If she was chipped,
Alie would know.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.341
That's why we're
putting her in the back.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.593
Through there.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.934
- All right.
- Uh...

07:13.142 --> 07:14.227
Tie her
to the bed.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.646
- Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah!
- It's OK. Hold her.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.857
- It's OK. It's OK now.
- Oh! Uh!

07:20.066 --> 07:22.902
Uh...Uh...Uh!

07:28.116 --> 07:30.284
We need to know
where you are.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.536
- Where the hell am I?
- Hold her!

07:31.744 --> 07:32.954
- Let me go!
- Got her? Hold her!

07:33.162 --> 07:35.998
Let me go! Uh! Rrgh!

07:36.207 --> 07:37.458
Uhh!

07:37.667 --> 07:39.544
Uh...Aah! No!

07:39.752 --> 07:40.878
Raven,
stop fighting.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.505
- Oh!
- Her hands! Tie her down!

07:42.713 --> 07:44.382
Why is it
always me?

07:44.590 --> 07:46.300
Aah! Uhh!

07:46.509 --> 07:47.510
Sinclair,
I need your help.

07:47.718 --> 07:48.719
Go, go!

07:48.928 --> 07:51.264
OK, Jasper.
Faster. Faster.

07:51.472 --> 07:55.393
Aah! Aah! Let me go!

07:55.601 --> 07:56.727
- Raven--
- come on.

07:56.936 --> 07:58.396
Agh! Uh...

07:58.604 --> 07:59.856
There.
I've got it.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.900
Agh! No! Agh!

08:03.109 --> 08:06.070
Let me go! Uh!

08:06.279 --> 08:09.449
Let me go!
Rragh!

08:09.657 --> 08:14.120
Rragh! Rragh! Uh!

08:14.328 --> 08:17.915
Let me go! Aah!

08:18.124 --> 08:20.835
Ah! Ah!

08:21.043 --> 08:25.006
Rragh! Rragh! Rragh...

08:25.214 --> 08:27.216
How the hell do we get
that thing out of her head?

08:27.425 --> 08:29.927
Working on it.

08:30.136 --> 08:32.263
Untie me! Untie me!

08:32.472 --> 08:34.515
I got this.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.144
I'll be
right here.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.980
No! Uh!

08:41.189 --> 08:44.275
Ah! Ah!

08:44.484 --> 08:45.985
Uhh!

08:46.194 --> 08:49.363
Niylah, we didn't
have a choice.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.449
Our friend can't see
you or this room

08:51.657 --> 08:53.159
until she's better.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.994
Why?

08:55.203 --> 08:56.412
It's hard to explain.

08:56.621 --> 08:58.498
Try.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.041
Just trust me
when I tell you

09:00.249 --> 09:01.918
it's important.

09:02.126 --> 09:05.004
Trust you after
what Skaikru did?

09:05.213 --> 09:08.007
That wasn't us.

09:08.216 --> 09:10.885
I'm sorry
about your father.

09:12.929 --> 09:15.306
We all are.

09:18.935 --> 09:21.479
What do you want
from me, Clarke?

09:21.687 --> 09:23.397
Last time I was here,

09:23.606 --> 09:25.983
you had one
of our wristbands.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.236
We need it now
to save our friend.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.154
Any why should
I help you?

09:30.363 --> 09:32.740
Because I know you won't
let an innocent girl suffer.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.582
Stay here.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.845
You OK?

09:56.764 --> 09:57.682
Fine.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.854
Niylah said
we can work in here.

10:04.063 --> 10:05.856
So how do we
do this?

10:06.065 --> 10:10.111
We think raven wanted
to use this wristband

10:10.319 --> 10:13.990
to generate an emp,
which is freakishly brilliant.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.575
Meaning what?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.285
A targeted
electromagnetic pulse

10:17.493 --> 10:19.203
could destroy
the chip's circuitry.

10:19.412 --> 10:22.081
Uh, we could use
this to send an emp

10:22.290 --> 10:24.584
along raven's
own nervous system.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.377
Just need
to reverse the polarity,

10:26.586 --> 10:28.462
wire for external input
and attach a battery.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.714
But what would
that do to her?

10:29.922 --> 10:31.340
Uh, EMPs don't
affect our bodies,

10:31.549 --> 10:32.675
but I don't know
the mechanics of how

10:32.883 --> 10:34.719
this chip integrates
with her brain.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.554
This was
raven's plan.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.014
She wouldn't do it
if it was gonna

10:38.222 --> 10:39.473
destroy her brain.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.601
Depends how bad
she wanted it out.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.936
Regardless,
without an electromagnet

10:44.145 --> 10:45.396
this is just talk.

10:45.605 --> 10:47.273
Where do we get one?

10:47.481 --> 10:48.774
The ark.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.443
Every station had
a pulsed inductive thruster

10:50.651 --> 10:51.694
for maneuvering.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.571
Arkadia is
out of the question.

10:53.779 --> 10:54.905
It's too dangerous.
You heard them.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.158
We use the Dropship.

10:57.325 --> 10:58.659
It has P.I. Thrusters
just like the ark.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.870
That's good. OK.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.872
- I'll go salvage a magnet.
- Uh, no.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.624
You should stay
with raven

11:04.832 --> 11:06.292
and figure out
how this thing works.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.044
I'll take the rover,

11:08.252 --> 11:09.670
be back by the time
you finish the device.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.589
I'll go with you.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.010
Don't.

11:39.325 --> 11:41.452
With marginally
more slack,

11:41.661 --> 11:43.663
you could reach
those knots.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.748
Uh!

11:45.956 --> 11:49.960
Come on. Don't--
don't do that.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.254
Raven...

11:52.463 --> 11:54.965
What are you doing?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.218
Uh...

11:57.385 --> 11:59.053
Uh...

11:59.261 --> 12:00.346
Uh!

12:00.554 --> 12:02.390
Ah!

12:06.227 --> 12:07.353
Uh!

12:07.561 --> 12:09.939
There is no pain
in the city of light.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.403
Guys?

12:19.532 --> 12:21.367
Uh!

12:21.575 --> 12:22.535
Guys!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.161
Nngh! Uh!

12:24.370 --> 12:26.163
- Stop her.
- Jasper, get that side.

12:26.372 --> 12:29.250
- Uh! Stop.
- She's reopened her wounds.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.751
Uh! Uh!

12:30.960 --> 12:33.212
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

12:33.421 --> 12:34.588
She's gonna
bleed to death.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.549
I need bandages.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.259
I got her.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.677
Bellamy,
take her wrists.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.804
Uh! Uh! Uhh!

12:42.012 --> 12:43.931
Raven, stop
fighting us.

12:46.517 --> 12:50.396
Alie. Alie.
Alie!

12:50.604 --> 12:52.398
I know you
can hear us.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.358
Why are you
doing this to her?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.277
Let her go.

12:56.485 --> 13:00.239
I'll let her go when you
give me what I want.

13:00.448 --> 13:03.075
The technology
that Clarke carries,

13:03.284 --> 13:05.703
it belongs to me.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.371
No way.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.456
Clarke, just
give it to her.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.167
Clarke!

13:12.793 --> 13:16.881
If you let raven die,
you'll never get it.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.928
Let them help you.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.604
Untie her wrists.
Hold her steady.

13:43.616 --> 13:45.826
Uh...Uh...

13:46.035 --> 13:47.953
Uh!

13:52.291 --> 13:55.419
Clarke, she's
never gonna stop

13:55.628 --> 13:57.588
trying to get away.

13:57.797 --> 14:00.800
We can't let her
hurt herself again.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.426
Someone has
to stay with her.

14:02.635 --> 14:04.595
I'll be
first watch.

14:04.804 --> 14:06.597
We'll
take turns.

14:06.806 --> 14:09.183
You don't give
the orders, Clarke.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.731
Guess he doesn't forgive you
for murdering his girlfriend.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.526
Jasper,

14:18.734 --> 14:21.445
take a break.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.188
You OK with her coming back
after all this time,

14:56.397 --> 14:58.941
taking over?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.944
She's trying
to save raven.

15:02.152 --> 15:06.073
Guess she thinks
raven's worth saving.

15:06.282 --> 15:08.659
Lucky for her.

15:11.537 --> 15:14.164
Let's get yourself
together, Jasper.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.751
You can't let your
anger get in the way

15:17.960 --> 15:19.211
of what we
have to do here.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.590
You know, that's funny
coming from you.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.718
When you're angry,
people die.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.304
Just ask that girl
over there.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.123
Thank you.

16:44.088 --> 16:47.132
Do you ever
see their faces?

16:49.343 --> 16:50.552
What?

16:50.761 --> 16:53.555
Of all the people
you've killed.

16:53.764 --> 16:56.100
Heh.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.144
I know what
you're doing,

16:59.353 --> 17:01.438
but you can't get to me,
Alie, so don't even bother.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.441
It's not Alie,
Clarke.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.694
It's raven,

17:06.902 --> 17:08.278
and I'm not trying
to get to you.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.156
I'm--I'm just trying
to tell you the truth

17:11.365 --> 17:13.993
because
no one else will.

17:14.201 --> 17:18.664
Everywhere you go,
death follows.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.126
You always want
to save everyone.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.711
What you
don't realize is,

17:23.919 --> 17:26.380
you're the one
we need saving from.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.048
Wells is dead because
you couldn't see

17:28.257 --> 17:30.926
Charlotte was
a basket case.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.137
Finn is dead because
you broke his heart

17:33.345 --> 17:35.556
and then slid
a knife into it.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.226
Hell, I bet you got
Lexa killed, too.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.353
Shut up.

17:41.562 --> 17:42.980
And then there's
dear, old dad.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.189
I said, shut up.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.649
Your mom's in here
with me, Clarke.

17:45.858 --> 17:46.984
She told me you tried
to convince him

17:47.192 --> 17:48.402
not to go public
about the fact

17:48.610 --> 17:49.695
the ark was dying.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.406
Guess you should've
tried harder.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.158
His blood is
on your hands, too.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.534
Shut up!

17:55.743 --> 17:57.619
You can hide behind
the selfless martyr act.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.205
We see you for what
you really are--

18:00.414 --> 18:02.750
poison to anyone
who gets close.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.501
Ow! Ah!

18:08.047 --> 18:10.215
You're done, Alie.
You hear me?

18:10.424 --> 18:12.551
- We're gonna fry you.
- Hey! Hey! Come on. Come on.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.636
Aah! Aah!

18:14.845 --> 18:16.221
Uh! Get off.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.557
- Stop!
- No!

18:18.766 --> 18:20.851
Just calm down.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.688
Well done.

18:24.897 --> 18:29.234
To fry--to cook
over direct heat,

18:29.443 --> 18:32.654
to destroy circuitry
with excessive current.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.742
They must be
building the EMP

18:36.950 --> 18:39.161
It's what
I was trying to do.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.789
They would need
an electromagnet.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.957
Where would
they get one?

18:46.085 --> 18:48.295
They're going
to the Dropship.

18:48.504 --> 18:51.423
Then so are we.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.735
Who'd have thought it'd be
good to see the Dropship?

19:11.944 --> 19:14.530
It's not.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.545
I heard you tell Bellamy
you're leaving.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.171
Is that true,

19:31.380 --> 19:33.799
after everything
we've been through?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.260
Yeah.

19:36.468 --> 19:40.556
Octavia, we're
your people.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.392
We were sent down
together.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.435
We survived together.

19:45.644 --> 19:48.188
Lincoln
was my people.

19:48.397 --> 19:51.275
I'm not Trikru.
I'm not Skaikru.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.861
I'm nothing.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.738
You're one
of the hundred.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.913
Not anymore.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.063
I let her
get to me.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.609
You don't say.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.403
Take a break.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.489
I'll let her beat
me up for a while.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.705
Ah...

20:48.999 --> 20:50.876
Truth hurts, huh?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.934
I'm sorry.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.355
What?

21:11.563 --> 21:14.066
I never wanted
to hurt Maya.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.445
I never wanted
any of this.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.494
I had to save
our people.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.996
I was going
to save everyone.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.086
I wish you could've.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.677
Shove your regret
up your ass.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.729
I had a hell
of a time

21:52.938 --> 21:54.773
prying open
the Subassembly,

21:54.982 --> 21:56.817
but I got it.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.081
Octavia!

22:24.303 --> 22:27.055
Oh, Monty.
Thank God.

22:27.264 --> 22:29.808
- Mom?
- Oh...

22:30.017 --> 22:32.894
I'm pretty sure I lost
them in the woods.

22:33.103 --> 22:36.315
Did you see anyone?
They're everywhere.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.403
You got away?

22:41.611 --> 22:43.655
I had to find you.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.579
How could you
turn me in?

22:50.787 --> 22:54.166
I would never
do that.

22:55.584 --> 22:59.421
Mom, what was dad's
favorite color?

23:01.006 --> 23:02.883
We don't have
time for this.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.509
We can't stay.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.386
Everyone knows to
look for you here.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.472
Brown.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.683
He said it reminded him
of your eyes,

23:11.892 --> 23:16.021
but you don't
remember that, do you?

23:20.275 --> 23:22.277
Don't let
him leave.

23:22.486 --> 23:23.904
He needs to
take the key

23:24.112 --> 23:25.781
so he can lead
us to raven.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.449
Ah!

23:27.657 --> 23:29.868
Uh! God!

23:30.077 --> 23:32.788
Uh uh uh! Ah!

23:32.996 --> 23:34.539
Uh! Mom, stop!

23:34.748 --> 23:37.751
I'll stop when
you take this.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.378
Never.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.922
Uh! Oh! Ah!

23:42.130 --> 23:45.050
Get off him!
Monty, are you OK?

23:45.258 --> 23:46.301
She's chipped.

23:46.510 --> 23:50.305
- Uh!
- Octavia! Don't!

23:50.514 --> 23:52.015
Uh!

23:54.351 --> 23:55.268
Uh! Uh!

23:55.477 --> 23:57.479
- Uh!
- Uh!

23:57.687 --> 24:00.315
Yah! Uh!

24:00.524 --> 24:01.900
Mom! What
are you doing?

24:02.109 --> 24:03.318
Please stop it!

24:03.527 --> 24:04.528
Oh...

24:04.736 --> 24:06.655
Stop, mom!

24:06.863 --> 24:09.950
Don't make me
do this.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.493
D'aah!

24:14.955 --> 24:16.373
Mom!

24:16.581 --> 24:18.250
D'aah!

24:32.139 --> 24:33.890
Monty!

24:58.081 --> 24:59.583
Hey.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.460
I just need to rewire
the firing mechanism,

25:01.668 --> 25:02.961
and we're good to go.

25:04.796 --> 25:07.299
Raven'll be
all right.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.470
You don't know that.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.810
She's all I have
left, Clarke.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.354
What if this thing
that I built

25:21.521 --> 25:24.566
destroys that
brilliant mind of hers?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.902
How do I live
with that?

25:28.278 --> 25:29.738
Jasper said that
she was trying

25:29.946 --> 25:32.407
to disconnect herself
from Alie.

25:32.616 --> 25:35.243
That's not
raven anymore.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.579
You sure about that?

25:37.787 --> 25:40.957
I'm not sure
about anything,

25:41.166 --> 25:43.585
but this is
our only choice.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.519
That wasn't
really her.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.441
It was Alie.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.735
My mom was
already gone.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.031
- Monty--
- it wasn't her.

26:22.874 --> 26:25.460
It wasn't her.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.799
They've got
the electromagnet.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.385
They're on the way.
You have to hurry.

26:36.805 --> 26:40.308
Look at your
united front.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.060
Tell me,
why do you give

26:42.269 --> 26:45.522
Bellamy a pass
for murdering your girlfriend?

26:45.730 --> 26:47.983
- What was her name?
- Don't talk about Maya.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.651
You don't have
to listen to this.

26:49.859 --> 26:52.070
Let's protect Jasper.

26:52.279 --> 26:56.408
Jasper's so sensitive.
Jasper's lost someone.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.536
Everyone cater
to his feelings.

26:59.744 --> 27:03.206
We've all lost someone.
You don't see us falling apart.

27:03.415 --> 27:06.751
You don't see us
getting wasted, being useless...

27:06.960 --> 27:09.087
No. You took a pill
to take your pain away.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.714
You gave up
your memories.

27:10.922 --> 27:13.717
But then why
should we expect anything more?

27:13.925 --> 27:17.887
You used to get high
off people's medicine.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.432
Being a selfish loser
was your only move.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.683
Please stop.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.310
That's all we see
when we look at you--

27:23.518 --> 27:26.563
a coward,
a waste of breath.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.024
Why do you even
bother living?

27:29.232 --> 27:34.070
You're weak, pathetic.
You can't save me.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.990
You can't even
save yourself.

27:37.198 --> 27:39.117
You couldn't save
what's her name.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.785
You know her name!

27:40.994 --> 27:43.163
Jasper, think.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.415
It's not raven
talking.

27:45.624 --> 27:49.377
You're giving her
what she wants.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.546
Go.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.312
Just you and me, huh?

28:08.897 --> 28:11.232
Oh, come on, Bellamy.

28:11.441 --> 28:14.402
We've had our fun
together, haven't we?

28:16.279 --> 28:18.907
It's OK.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.701
We don't have
to talk about it--

28:21.910 --> 28:24.537
there's really not much
to talk about, anyway--

28:24.746 --> 28:26.623
but I do have
one question.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.000
Does it bother you that
you don't get any credit

28:29.209 --> 28:31.753
for the genocide
at mount weather?

28:31.961 --> 28:33.630
Clarke gets to be
the commander of death,

28:33.838 --> 28:35.382
but you murdered
all those people, too,

28:35.590 --> 28:37.342
and you're
just forgotten.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.136
Then again, you
didn't get any credit

28:40.345 --> 28:42.555
for the culling
on the ark, either.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.558
How many people suffocated
when you threw away my radio?

28:45.767 --> 28:48.728
At least Clarke was
saving her own people.

28:48.937 --> 28:51.231
You were just saving
your own ass.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.692
Of course that's nothing

28:53.900 --> 28:56.569
compared to killing
your own mom.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.116
You just had to take
little sister

29:01.324 --> 29:03.034
to her first dance.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.828
You might as well just
shoved aurora

29:05.036 --> 29:07.330
out of the airlock
yourself.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.624
Do you think she'd be
proud of you now

29:09.833 --> 29:13.002
for the kind of leader
you've become,

29:13.211 --> 29:17.090
or would she see the truth
like the rest of us do,

29:17.298 --> 29:18.925
that you're a follower?

29:19.134 --> 29:22.262
Clarke's been back for one day,
you're already taking orders,

29:22.470 --> 29:26.474
the good, little knight
by his queen's side.

29:26.683 --> 29:29.561
Too bad you were never
that devoted to Gina.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.564
You don't know what
you're talking about.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.274
Don't worry.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.901
Gina was already dead
when mount weather blew up,

29:37.110 --> 29:38.695
and you avenged her, right?

29:38.903 --> 29:40.488
I mean, you picked up a gun
and slaughtered an army

29:40.697 --> 29:42.490
that was sent to protect us,

29:42.699 --> 29:45.493
that had nothing to do with
blowing sweet Gina to bits,

29:45.702 --> 29:49.622
but, hey, a grounder's
a grounder, right?

29:49.831 --> 29:51.624
My father, you--

29:51.791 --> 29:53.418
- Niylah--
- you killed him.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.462
Niylah, Niylah,
you can't be in here.

29:55.670 --> 29:59.424
It's too late.
Raven's already seen her.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.718
Alie knows we're here.

30:05.555 --> 30:08.600
Good work, raven.
Help is on the way.

30:19.944 --> 30:21.029
Rrgh!

30:22.489 --> 30:24.199
Ohh!

30:25.950 --> 30:28.536
Feel better?

30:33.958 --> 30:37.128
All I wanted was
to protect my people.

30:37.337 --> 30:39.172
By destroying mine.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.431
I'm sorry.

30:50.141 --> 30:52.602
People like you
always are.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.752
What happened?

31:30.515 --> 31:32.475
Everyone, let's go.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.270
We're all set.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.689
All we have to do
is connect her

31:37.897 --> 31:40.316
and activate
the electromagnet.

31:46.823 --> 31:49.951
Their design is good.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.078
- Hold her arm still.
- Raven--

31:52.287 --> 31:54.873
they won't be able to get here
before they disconnect you.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.249
Hold it still.
Raven--

31:56.457 --> 31:59.043
you know too much.
I can't let them have you.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.546
- Raven, stop.
- Raven, stop it. Stop it.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.881
- Uh!
- Raven!

32:03.089 --> 32:04.966
Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah!

32:05.174 --> 32:06.843
She's trying
to kill herself.

32:07.051 --> 32:07.844
Raven, stop.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.178
Uh! Uh!

32:09.387 --> 32:11.556
Raven--

32:11.764 --> 32:14.559
Aagh! Stop it!

32:14.767 --> 32:16.394
Uh! Aah!

32:16.603 --> 32:19.689
Stop, and I'll
give you this.

32:24.527 --> 32:27.822
Aagh! No.
You lied! You lied!

32:29.574 --> 32:31.367
No. No. Please don't.

32:31.576 --> 32:32.994
The EMP will give me
brain damage.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.829
You know it will.
Please don't do this.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.539
Don't listen to her.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.751
Please. You know it will.
Sinclair, stop! Sinclair, no.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.377
We've only got
one shot at this.

32:41.586 --> 32:43.004
The EMP will fry
the wristband, too.

32:43.212 --> 32:44.839
- Do it.
- OK. Got it.

32:45.048 --> 32:46.257
- Go.
- No!

32:49.677 --> 32:51.763
What's happening?

32:53.514 --> 32:55.266
Nothing. There's
no more power.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.643
The battery's
not strong enough.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.061
Well, then get one
that is.

32:58.269 --> 32:59.938
- The rover.
- Aah! Uh!

33:00.146 --> 33:01.147
Sinclair, hold her!
Hold her!

33:01.356 --> 33:03.358
Go, go, go.
Go. Go.

33:03.566 --> 33:04.734
Aah!

33:09.238 --> 33:10.657
Go.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.079
Drone!

33:17.413 --> 33:19.374
She's here.

33:22.961 --> 33:24.087
Not anymore.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.339
Get the damn
battery. Go!

33:26.547 --> 33:28.800
- Uh! Uh! Uh!
- It's OK. Here they come.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.094
- This is our chance.
- Aah!

33:31.302 --> 33:34.347
Guys, we have
to move! Move!

33:34.555 --> 33:37.225
Aah! Uh...

33:37.433 --> 33:39.018
- Come on.
- Got it.

33:39.227 --> 33:41.813
- Uh!
- Aah!

33:54.659 --> 33:57.286
She's breathing.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.958
Raven? Come on,
raven. Hey.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.209
Come on, raven.

34:03.418 --> 34:05.628
Come on. Come on,
raven. Wake up.

34:05.837 --> 34:08.715
- Hey.
- Wake up.

34:08.923 --> 34:10.925
Please.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.017
She warned us.

34:19.225 --> 34:23.354
Come on, raven.
Wake up.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.940
Please.

34:30.445 --> 34:32.155
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.

34:32.363 --> 34:34.824
No. You can't.
No. Give it back.

34:35.033 --> 34:35.950
Alie did that
to raven.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.285
She's never
gonna get this.

34:37.493 --> 34:40.329
Don't! Stop!
It's Lexa.

34:42.165 --> 34:43.708
Part of her's
still in there.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.793
I saw them cut it
out of her head.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.629
I'm not--

34:50.339 --> 34:52.884
what is it?

34:53.092 --> 34:56.179
Both the A.I.s were made
by the same person.

34:56.387 --> 34:58.848
Both tap into
human consciousness.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.726
They must work
similarly, right?

35:01.934 --> 35:03.686
There's probably only
one pathway to consciousness,

35:03.895 --> 35:05.229
so it's possible, yeah.

35:05.438 --> 35:07.148
What does this have
to do with anything?

35:07.356 --> 35:09.984
I've seen an a.I.
Get removed before.

35:10.193 --> 35:12.487
Help me get her
on her side.

35:12.695 --> 35:16.074
OK. 1, 2, 3. Uh!

35:16.282 --> 35:18.951
Get that med kit
from my bag.

35:20.787 --> 35:24.123
Yep.
Uh! OK.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.512
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what--

35:37.720 --> 35:40.473
it's OK.

35:53.611 --> 35:55.571
This has to work.

36:06.249 --> 36:08.835
Ugh...

36:09.043 --> 36:12.046
What is that?

36:13.965 --> 36:16.676
It must be whatever's
left of the chip.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.518
Hey, hey...

36:28.229 --> 36:30.189
Ha ha!

36:30.398 --> 36:32.358
Ow...

36:32.567 --> 36:34.694
Get her up. Go.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.572
Never thought I'd be so happy
to see someone in pain.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.825
Ha ha ha! Ow...

36:42.785 --> 36:47.165
Ahh...Ha ha! Ow.

36:53.588 --> 36:55.548
Couldn't do
what you did.

37:08.519 --> 37:11.272
I could have
saved my mom.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.570
Hey--

37:17.778 --> 37:20.323
get the hell
away from me.

37:31.250 --> 37:36.047
Alie knows we're here.
We got to move.

38:32.436 --> 38:35.314
I'm sorry for not
telling you about Bellamy,

38:35.523 --> 38:37.650
but you wouldn't have helped
if you knew the truth.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.193
You didn't give
either of us

38:39.402 --> 38:41.862
the chance
to find out.

38:42.071 --> 38:43.906
Just go, Clarke.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.117
You can't stay here.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.744
If you do, you'll end up
just like my friend.

38:48.953 --> 38:51.080
You need to run.

38:56.002 --> 38:58.254
It's time for
a supply run, anyway.

39:26.699 --> 39:29.327
You'll recover.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.205
Will I?

39:37.335 --> 39:40.504
What do you do
when you realize

39:40.713 --> 39:42.965
you might not
be the good guy?

39:47.970 --> 39:50.973
Maybe there are
no good guys.

39:56.062 --> 39:58.522
Back it up.

40:00.399 --> 40:03.069
OK. Good.

40:03.277 --> 40:05.404
Ah...Ah!

40:05.613 --> 40:06.947
You really OK?

40:07.156 --> 40:08.491
Ah...

40:08.699 --> 40:11.994
I'm so sorry
for all the crap I said.

40:12.203 --> 40:15.039
And for punching me
in the face, right?

40:15.247 --> 40:19.460
No. You definitely
deserved that. Ha ha!

40:19.668 --> 40:22.129
Watch out.
OK. Step up.

40:22.338 --> 40:23.798
Ah! Ah...

40:24.006 --> 40:26.342
Hey, there's
something

40:26.550 --> 40:29.011
I don't
understand.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.596
Why did
Alie want you

40:30.763 --> 40:32.515
to kill
yourself?

40:35.393 --> 40:38.979
Because I know why
she wants the second a.I.

40:39.188 --> 40:41.607
Why?

40:41.816 --> 40:43.818
It's the only thing
that can stop her.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.863
Then let's stop her.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.618
We survive together.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.884
- Come on.
- Mm!

41:11.429 --> 41:14.515
- OK.
- Uh...

41:14.723 --> 41:16.142
Ah...

41:34.660 --> 41:38.831
We'll get raven back.
We'll get them all.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.375
It's bigger
than that.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.711
With raven's abilities,
she'll be able

41:43.919 --> 41:46.547
to understand
what she learned here.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.467
They'll know the second
a.I. Can stop me.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.927
We'll have
to kill them all.
