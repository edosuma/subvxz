01:20.625 --> 01:22.445
<i>Over here!
I got one!</i>

01:38.452 --> 01:41.880
<i>You will quite a surprise,
my little sandwich.</i>

02:39.814 --> 02:41.342
<i>Hi, this is Ida Teeter.</i>

02:41.426 --> 02:42.809
<i>I can't be bugged right now.</i>

02:44.303 --> 02:45.062
<i>Leave a message.</i>

02:45.539 --> 02:47.443
<i>Hey, Ida, it's Danielle.</i>

02:47.682 --> 02:48.937
<i>I called to let you know...</i>

02:49.234 --> 02:51.625
<i>It's not really nice for
you to put this off to say it.</i>

02:51.861 --> 02:53.421
<i>I'm gonna have to stand you up tonight.</i>

02:53.876 --> 02:57.029
<i>The whole bug thing pretty much creeps
the crap out of me and I just can't...</i>

02:58.888 --> 03:02.346
<i>Uh, that was mean.  I am sorry
if it hurts.  I can't go there.</i>

03:22.988 --> 03:24.105
Toby!

03:25.294 --> 03:26.819
How did you get out?

03:31.569 --> 03:34.723
Is it you wanted to cheer
momsie up, didn't you?

03:35.463 --> 03:37.394
Ohh, little sweetie!

03:38.099 --> 03:39.544
Oh, I know.

04:36.087 --> 04:37.760
Stood up again?

04:39.041 --> 04:41.818
I am so freaking pathetic!

04:42.547 --> 04:45.457
I thought she really liked me, Max!

04:45.869 --> 04:46.656
Too bad.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.424
She had a really nice rack, too.

04:50.069 --> 04:53.890
She said the bug thing creeps
the crap out of her.

04:54.581 --> 04:57.107
A very unattractive image.

04:57.419 --> 05:00.052
I just want to meet someone...

05:00.946 --> 05:02.276
I connect with.

05:02.329 --> 05:04.070
You're the chicks, darling.

05:04.310 --> 05:06.757
That's a scientific impossibility.

05:11.203 --> 05:13.560
What about that brunette that
is always sketching downstairs

05:13.563 --> 05:15.340
by the elevator?
She's not bad!

05:15.444 --> 05:18.568
I don't know, her hair
is always in her face.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.660
I have to be able to look in a
woman's eyes, in order to know...

05:21.668 --> 05:23.918
I have to be able to
look in a woman's ass.

05:24.187 --> 05:27.781
Well... not in a woman's ass, at it.

05:28.318 --> 05:29.185
Anyway.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.819
I've seen hers.
And it's pretty dang nice.

05:33.519 --> 05:34.899
I don't know.

05:35.939 --> 05:40.178
She seems kind of... weird.

05:41.228 --> 05:42.460
Aha.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.555
Look, Ida, I said before,
and I'll say it again:

05:48.797 --> 05:51.853
Never tell the ladies
what you do for a living.

05:52.357 --> 05:54.913
And get rid of your pets.

05:55.243 --> 05:57.484
I don't even keep books
about bugs around the house.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.547
Drive the chickees away like poison.

05:59.642 --> 06:02.318
Max!  This is who I am!

06:03.861 --> 06:05.382
Jeeves.

06:05.417 --> 06:08.550
I'm just saying, some point
you gonna have to make the choice:

06:08.980 --> 06:11.087
Babes, or bugs.

06:11.090 --> 06:12.643
You can't have both.

06:24.436 --> 06:28.407
<i>Alright, you creepy little
sucker, end of the line!</i>

06:30.638 --> 06:33.358
<i>I have to deliver a package, ma'am.</i>

06:36.781 --> 06:38.293
And so the grad student says:

06:38.800 --> 06:42.079
My oh my, professor, is
that a proboscis in your lab coat,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.205
or you just happy to see me?

06:49.706 --> 06:50.494
Go on.

06:53.309 --> 06:54.489
Go on!

07:13.007 --> 07:15.887
I've seen you here before, but
I haven't actually talk to you.

07:19.377 --> 07:24.759
- Hi... I am...
- Ida Teeter, I know.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.030
I always sit here.  It's a peaceful
place for me to do my work

07:27.036 --> 07:28.920
and it reminds me of my father.

07:30.208 --> 07:33.782
Umm...
What is your...?

07:33.795 --> 07:36.080
My name is Misty Falls,
but I'm not a hippie.

07:37.176 --> 07:40.135
Nice to make your acquaintance, Misty.

07:40.139 --> 07:41.929
So what is it that
you do here, Ida Teeter?

07:42.087 --> 07:43.112
Teeder totter.

07:46.735 --> 07:55.196
I... you know...
work here.

07:56.496 --> 07:57.562
I work here.

07:57.632 --> 08:01.746
So Ida Teeter, I was going maybe
go get a cup of coffee later, and
was wondering if you'd like to...

08:03.282 --> 08:04.400
Damn it, I don't even
know why I said that.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.347
That was a totally stupid thing to say!

08:06.604 --> 08:08.628
I hate coffee!
I drink tea.

08:09.675 --> 08:10.396
What was that?

08:13.039 --> 08:14.771
Well, what's under your hand?

08:16.785 --> 08:17.633
Pen broke!

08:19.784 --> 08:21.761
Pen broke...

08:23.639 --> 08:27.117
I'm sorry...
I am kind of in a hurry.

08:28.465 --> 08:31.446
Okay, Ida.  I understand.

09:18.039 --> 09:21.519
Shoo!  Shoo!
Go on.

09:27.704 --> 09:31.856
Well...
Hello!

09:32.821 --> 09:35.456
<i>Where you from, my pal?</i>

09:37.535 --> 09:41.112
Miss Teeter?
I was hoping to catch you.

09:49.303 --> 09:50.882
Hello, Miss Beasley.

09:52.410 --> 09:53.841
What is happening, Lady Bug?

09:54.408 --> 09:56.326
Give me some skin.

09:57.148 --> 09:59.167
Are you ever going
to take that thing off?

09:59.389 --> 10:02.195
Halloween was over
for a month ago, kiddo.

10:03.328 --> 10:04.299
I know.

10:04.434 --> 10:08.222
Ridiculous thing.  Always
jamming up the washing machine.

10:09.195 --> 10:12.399
Now, Ida, there is something
we need to discuss.

10:12.857 --> 10:13.823
Sure.

10:14.028 --> 10:18.019
The neighbors have a problem,
and, frankly, I share their concern.

10:18.708 --> 10:19.873
Yes, ma'am.

10:20.279 --> 10:23.010
But, when I moved in, you
told me that I could keep pets.

10:23.014 --> 10:25.661
- You did, Grandma
- Don't interrupt, Betty.

10:26.438 --> 10:31.493
I meant a dog, a cat, a
gold fish, a pot-bellied pig...

10:31.862 --> 10:34.120
- But not...
- You didn't say that, Grandma!

10:34.121 --> 10:35.060
Betty!

10:36.033 --> 10:38.311
My pets are safer than gold fish.

10:38.426 --> 10:40.573
There is no water to leak on the floor,

10:40.961 --> 10:42.351
there is no barking...

10:42.352 --> 10:43.652
Well...

10:44.446 --> 10:46.868
They do chirp a little bit, but only if...

10:46.869 --> 10:49.165
I keep a clean building, Miss Teeter.

10:49.169 --> 10:51.706
I cannot have bugs all over the place!

10:51.707 --> 10:55.959
Hey!  I'm a bug!  You don't
want me in your apartment!

10:56.807 --> 11:00.960
Yes, Miss Beasley, I know.
You do keep this place spotless.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.873
And I promise you.  My pets
will never cause any trouble.

11:39.448 --> 11:43.004
Oh!  Hello there, big fellow!

11:51.545 --> 11:55.409
Hello, Doro.  Look what
you do to little Tommy?

12:00.494 --> 12:01.352
Hello?

12:01.390 --> 12:04.181
Somebody sent me a package.
A bug.

12:04.408 --> 12:05.408
Ida?

12:06.648 --> 12:09.170
- What time is it?
- I thought that it was a mantid but...

12:09.177 --> 12:11.452
it's just too... bizarre!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.741
Describe it to me.

12:13.798 --> 12:14.925
Um, hold on a second.

12:15.970 --> 12:19.929
Stevee! you are so sneaky.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.855
What are you girls doing, little dude?

12:25.372 --> 12:27.093
<i>You are a sweetie.</i>

12:27.334 --> 12:28.106
Ida?

12:28.934 --> 12:29.985
I almost forgot!

12:30.266 --> 12:33.397
The artist girl is a beastnies!

12:34.143 --> 12:35.788
So adorable!

12:36.247 --> 12:38.870
So, I am going to take some vitamins,

12:38.875 --> 12:40.035
grow some nuts overnight,

12:40.040 --> 12:42.095
and ask her to dinner tomorrow.

12:42.364 --> 12:43.654
Hey, how about that!

12:44.027 --> 12:45.619
Girls in lust.

12:46.324 --> 12:48.649
You better give me a full description
of what happens afterwards.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.826
It's great material for
the shower in the morning.

12:50.860 --> 12:52.612
You are so gross!

12:57.049 --> 12:59.316
Okay.  It has a head like a...

13:00.172 --> 13:03.358
Ohh!  Did you hear that?

13:03.645 --> 13:06.906
Oh, Max, it is so beautiful!

13:07.088 --> 13:08.553
How much segments on its abdomen?

13:08.603 --> 13:09.859
Hold on, let me check.

13:10.116 --> 13:14.225
It's originally from Brazil, but I
have no idea who send it to me.

13:17.027 --> 13:20.495
Woh, cowboy!
It's aggressive.

13:20.739 --> 13:22.100
Look, Ida, I'm really beat.

13:22.247 --> 13:24.416
Let's look it up in the
lab tomorrow morning.

14:12.155 --> 14:15.241
Wish me luck, Mick!

14:16.330 --> 14:18.496
That was very good name for you.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.949
See you later, my girl pal.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.651
HiÂ¡... Misty.

15:02.131 --> 15:04.561
I was wondering if you would...

15:05.426 --> 15:11.179
I mean... if you're not busy,
or anything...

15:11.378 --> 15:12.566
if you would like to go to...

15:15.412 --> 15:17.389
Would you like come have
dinner with me, tonight?

15:25.361 --> 15:29.128
- You asked her out?
- Yes!  And she was totally receptive.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.787
And she drew this little
neat pixie drawing of me!

15:32.544 --> 15:35.704
That's all she draws, pixies.
It's her thing.

15:36.582 --> 15:38.472
You talked about your thing?

15:39.027 --> 15:41.723
Not. Not a pip, General!

15:41.903 --> 15:42.682
Good.

15:43.199 --> 15:44.760
Now, you probably gonna
want to go her place,

15:44.761 --> 15:46.547
- because of all your damn bugs.
- Look at this!

15:47.929 --> 15:49.222
Oh my God!

15:50.885 --> 15:53.297
Not North American.
Is it Chinese?

15:53.878 --> 15:55.265
Sure is.
Looks at his head!

15:55.996 --> 15:58.750
Hey, how about that?   The Chinese
food is actually come from China!

15:58.757 --> 16:00.398
This place rocks!

16:46.840 --> 16:47.988
Nervous?

16:48.409 --> 16:49.449
Who, me?

16:51.004 --> 16:53.539
Yeah, but I'm always really nervous.
But this... this is a cool place.

16:53.636 --> 16:54.848
You come here a lot?

16:55.918 --> 16:58.453
Yes.   I'm a regular.

16:59.197 --> 17:01.383
- But I've never been here...
- On a date?

17:03.085 --> 17:05.520
Is this a date?
Oh God, I am so stupid!

17:05.525 --> 17:07.031
Why did I just say that?

17:09.780 --> 17:12.419
I think that you're very
attractive, and I would just

17:12.429 --> 17:15.147
crack like a Fortune Cookie,
if I didn't out and say it, so...

17:16.579 --> 17:17.719
There, I said it.

17:18.077 --> 17:21.561
You think... I'm attractive?

17:24.838 --> 17:26.255
Really?

17:40.027 --> 17:41.104
Cha Ming Dao.

17:49.084 --> 17:53.208
Um... I thought maybe we
could go see a movie, later.

17:53.996 --> 17:58.322
But I looked the paper, and it's just
all horror and talking monkeys, so...

17:58.786 --> 18:03.654
I rented something.
I hope you don't think I'm...

18:04.522 --> 18:05.438
...presumptuous.

18:06.758 --> 18:09.693
Okay.  What is it about?

18:09.810 --> 18:11.075
Texas Pixies.

18:11.870 --> 18:14.580
So do you have a DVD player, cos I
thought maybe we go up to your place,

18:14.586 --> 18:15.995
all I have is a VHS.

18:17.647 --> 18:21.641
I am sorry.  You're going
a little too fast for me.

18:22.070 --> 18:26.072
That... that does
really seem calculated.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.634
No, no!   I mean, you're
talking a little too fast for me!

18:31.963 --> 18:34.424
I couldn't understand
what you were saying!

18:35.556 --> 18:38.100
I was just asking if
you have a DVD player?

18:39.516 --> 18:42.152
Yes.  Yes, I do.

18:42.359 --> 18:44.891
Okay, so then after this,
we could just go to your place.

18:47.763 --> 18:49.523
Babes, or bugs!

18:49.873 --> 18:51.323
You can't have both!

18:51.452 --> 18:55.946
Actually, it's a kind
of a mess over there.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.477
And my landlady, she is very...

19:04.502 --> 19:06.884
Oh, sure, what the heck?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.334
We can go to my place.

19:10.029 --> 19:11.721
Lady bug has my back.

19:26.024 --> 19:27.347
Watch your step.

19:27.607 --> 19:29.631
This building is really cool.

19:30.845 --> 19:33.928
My place is a total cockroach
factory, compared to this.

19:35.433 --> 19:39.639
Well, Ms Beasley keeps a
pretty clean place around here.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.265
Betty, you little brat.

19:45.483 --> 19:48.089
I'm not Betty, I am lady bug.

19:48.670 --> 19:52.626
- I am sorry.
- Give me some skin.

19:53.694 --> 19:56.826
Misty, this is my friend, the lady bug.

19:57.309 --> 19:58.753
Oh, cool.

19:59.069 --> 20:00.627
Are you a fairy?

20:02.633 --> 20:04.975
No, but I love fairies!

20:04.978 --> 20:07.430
Betty, it's time for bed.

20:12.376 --> 20:13.616
Hello, Lana.

20:14.444 --> 20:16.113
Good evening, Miss Teeter.

20:16.135 --> 20:18.569
Oh, you have a
beautiful daughter, ma'am.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.740
It's her granddaughter.

20:30.023 --> 20:33.883
Good line, Misty.
Very good line.

20:50.525 --> 20:55.809
Wow!  This is Snugsville!

20:56.861 --> 20:57.805
Yeah.

20:59.798 --> 21:01.019
Cool!

21:02.058 --> 21:03.629
Is that the bedroom?

21:04.762 --> 21:06.394
Don't go in there!

21:08.233 --> 21:09.550
Don't go in there.

21:10.023 --> 21:12.034
I didn't mean anything by it.

21:12.141 --> 21:15.579
No, I just... I don't... I just...

21:20.432 --> 21:24.168
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah. Yes, oh yeah. Thank you.

21:35.950 --> 21:38.975
I don't really have
anything to mix with it.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.844
It's okay.
Thank you, Ida.

22:08.552 --> 22:11.903
Is this... the most
boring first date ever?

23:24.469 --> 23:25.977
Why are you calling me?

23:26.082 --> 23:28.092
<i>Just wanted to hear
how your hot day went.</i>

23:28.145 --> 23:30.640
I had a pretty important date in
the shower in the morning...

23:30.645 --> 23:34.349
It is still going, and it is boiling, and she
is here, and we are watching a movie.

23:34.406 --> 23:35.919
You get rid of the bugs?

23:39.186 --> 23:40.019
Yes.

23:40.043 --> 23:40.802
<i>Really?</i>

23:40.944 --> 23:42.822
Wow, I don't think you'd ever.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.636
Where did you put them?

23:45.747 --> 23:47.816
In the bedroom.

23:48.310 --> 23:52.167
Ida, the idea was to get her into the
bedroom.  What the hell were you thinking?

23:53.208 --> 23:55.471
Dammit!  I wasn't thinking!

23:55.603 --> 23:57.922
I didn't know that she would be so easy!

23:58.394 --> 24:00.658
I mean, not that she is,
you know, easy, but...

24:01.431 --> 24:03.228
I like her, she likes me...

24:03.909 --> 24:07.720
Oh shit!  Oh shit, shit, shit!

24:08.337 --> 24:09.415
- Ida!
- Max!

24:09.416 --> 24:10.406
- Ida
- What do I do?

24:10.627 --> 24:11.883
Breathe deeply.

24:13.097 --> 24:16.094
Listen to me.  Go in
there, and make your move.

24:16.229 --> 24:18.332
But don't let her see the bugs!

24:19.403 --> 24:20.981
Alright, call me in the morning.

24:21.531 --> 24:22.664
Take a shower in 6:00...

24:27.803 --> 24:29.838
Are you cold?
I have some...

25:21.494 --> 25:22.718
Where am I?

25:24.720 --> 25:25.545
Oops!

25:28.560 --> 25:33.254
Are you tucking me in?
It's so sweet!

25:35.678 --> 25:39.569
Um...  Are you okay to drive?

25:50.423 --> 25:51.744
You want me to go?

25:52.690 --> 25:56.367
No! No.

25:57.975 --> 26:01.238
I... don't want you to go.

26:04.645 --> 26:06.088
I can stay?

26:20.777 --> 26:26.431
You'd probably need pajamas...
and um... privacy, so...

26:26.615 --> 26:28.931
I'm just... gonna um...

26:32.806 --> 26:36.133
I don't... need pajamas...

26:39.245 --> 26:40.984
or privacy.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.900
Come here.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.581
Yeah.
Come here.

27:53.188 --> 27:55.966
Am I... being too aggressive?

27:57.940 --> 28:04.177
No, but... let's just be tender.

29:12.296 --> 29:16.886
Oh... my... gosh.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.245
What is this?

29:19.468 --> 29:23.853
I'm sorry.  I am going
to get rid of them.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.802
Isn't it Lucanus elaphus?
From Thailand?

29:27.491 --> 29:29.653
You know about stag beetles?

29:29.776 --> 29:34.128
Not, not really, but my dad was the
bigwig bug professor at the college,

29:34.311 --> 29:35.950
up until a year ago, when he decided

29:35.951 --> 29:37.973
he need get away for
weeks, he found out...

29:37.974 --> 29:41.078
Your father is professor Malcolm Wolf?

29:41.299 --> 29:44.705
He was my favorite professor in
college.  I learned so much from him.

29:44.873 --> 29:46.543
Wow!  What a coincidence!

29:46.606 --> 29:47.656
How is he do...?

29:49.941 --> 29:54.249
Wait a minute.  You told
me your last name was...

29:54.284 --> 29:57.318
Mama was a hippie.
She gave me my own last name.

29:58.172 --> 30:02.064
So...
You are not bothered by them?

30:02.882 --> 30:06.002
Some people are... bothered by them.

30:06.102 --> 30:09.977
No.  Hey, when I said
this place was Snugsville?

30:10.229 --> 30:12.602
I guess it's really bugsville!

30:16.538 --> 30:17.574
I love it.

30:24.452 --> 30:26.250
Looks like one of your babies got lose.

30:26.251 --> 30:27.120
Damn it!

30:28.834 --> 30:29.893
Mick.

30:33.104 --> 30:35.984
You wouldn't wanna help
me look for him, would you?

30:36.964 --> 30:41.252
I mean... we would have to be
careful, it's kind of aggressive, but...

30:41.908 --> 30:44.920
If you want to, we could...

32:17.058 --> 32:20.528
I am so sorry.
Are you alright?

32:21.692 --> 32:24.069
I didn't hit you that hard, did I?

32:25.311 --> 32:27.859
No, I just feel a little weak.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.872
I guess I'm paying for
all that whiskey I drank.

32:32.340 --> 32:33.949
You should lay down.

32:43.557 --> 32:46.401
Doesn't feel like you have a fever.

32:48.965 --> 32:50.800
You really give a shit?

32:51.272 --> 32:52.428
What?

32:53.272 --> 32:55.753
Do you really care about me, Ida?

33:00.015 --> 33:01.791
Yes.  Yes, I do.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.921
You make me feel like, myself.

33:09.819 --> 33:13.741
Hey, what's wrong, sweetie?

33:14.339 --> 33:18.776
Nothing.  Now that I finally have you.

33:35.618 --> 33:37.995
This is absurd, no
insect looks like this!

33:38.119 --> 33:42.534
I'm telling you.  That is
what it looks like!  Exactly!

33:42.618 --> 33:44.443
Okay, bring it in!
Prove it.

33:45.121 --> 33:47.313
Umm.  I can't.

33:48.393 --> 33:50.685
It kind of got lose,
and now we can't find it.

33:52.928 --> 33:54.016
We?

33:55.177 --> 33:56.297
Who drew these?

33:58.221 --> 34:01.564
I described it to Misty,
and she drew them for me!

34:02.270 --> 34:05.176
She is a such a great artist!

34:05.611 --> 34:07.091
Misty, Misty, Misty.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.455
You sound like you're in love.

34:08.543 --> 34:11.902
Yeah!  I kind of vamp!

34:14.109 --> 34:15.667
So?

34:16.545 --> 34:18.554
Just take it easy.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.590
You gotta read Martin Moore.

34:20.947 --> 34:21.987
What?

34:22.902 --> 34:26.284
I want to spend every minute
I possibly can with this person,

34:26.284 --> 34:28.627
and you're telling me take it easy?

34:29.106 --> 34:33.527
Look, I am glad to see you getting some
action from something beside mantids.

34:33.721 --> 34:35.482
But you might want
to take it easy, kiddo.

34:36.272 --> 34:39.690
Women can drain your vital juices.

34:40.539 --> 34:42.286
And not just the sex ones either.

34:42.466 --> 34:46.317
Max!  You are worse than a
high-school chick sometimes.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.168
What?

34:47.248 --> 34:51.561
We will take it at our own pace,
if that is fine with you.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.097
And your juices.

34:56.975 --> 34:58.427
Welcome home!

35:07.014 --> 35:13.386
Oh!  Are you alright, sweet stuff?
Are you still not feeling well?

35:13.664 --> 35:14.729
I'm okay.

35:15.807 --> 35:21.563
You know... we haven't exactly been
sleeping a lot these last few nights.

35:21.598 --> 35:22.622
It's true.

35:24.295 --> 35:26.067
Let's get you settled in.

36:08.405 --> 36:09.739
Betty, no!

36:34.182 --> 36:35.496
Sure about this?

36:35.921 --> 36:37.731
Sure it's not too fast?

36:38.593 --> 36:42.686
I have never been so sure
about anything in my life, Misty.

36:44.039 --> 36:45.781
I kind of love you!

36:45.812 --> 36:49.346
You have no idea how long I have
been waiting to hear you say that!

36:52.102 --> 36:54.050
No one's ever loved me before.

36:54.845 --> 36:59.645
It feels so... I don't know!

37:00.802 --> 37:07.230
Like... something inside is...
telling me that I need to be here.

37:08.382 --> 37:11.101
Right here, right now...

37:11.300 --> 37:12.717
with you.

37:16.232 --> 37:18.029
I feel it too.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.583
I couldn't catch him.

37:34.924 --> 37:36.813
Hey!  What's wrong, Grandma?

38:04.257 --> 38:07.931
Stevee.
Stevee!

38:29.266 --> 38:33.898
LOST DOG

39:05.863 --> 39:09.887
Here you are this whole
time, nesting in a pillow?

39:14.781 --> 39:17.487
Mama Ida is gonna be stilt you're okay.

40:00.143 --> 40:01.019
What is it?

40:01.020 --> 40:05.076
The mystery man from Brazil,
who sent me that unclassified insect.

40:06.057 --> 40:07.511
He wrote me a letter.

40:10.134 --> 40:12.117
I think he is kind of a kook.

40:12.598 --> 40:14.118
What do you mean?

40:14.495 --> 40:17.580
Well, he seems to think that
that weird bug

40:17.582 --> 40:19.834
he sent me is dangerous.

40:20.270 --> 40:21.817
Venomous, maybe.

40:21.822 --> 40:23.819
He's crazy.  Who wrote this?

40:23.854 --> 40:25.751
He doesn't identify himself.

40:26.251 --> 40:31.991
But, it's strange.  There's an
apologetic tone to the letter,

40:32.086 --> 40:36.085
like... like he intentionally
kept this information

40:36.088 --> 40:37.618
from me when he sent me the package,

40:37.618 --> 40:39.486
and then thought better of it.

40:39.677 --> 40:42.860
And what's weirder, is I
think I know this guy.

40:43.196 --> 40:45.169
I mean, he writes like he knows me!

40:45.477 --> 40:54.984
But, I just can't... call
him up for some reason.

40:55.573 --> 40:57.065
Juices, juices, juices.

40:57.046 --> 40:58.555
Shut up!
I'm serious!

40:59.280 --> 41:01.263
An insect that hunts and kills mammals?

41:01.331 --> 41:02.672
Come on, there's no such thing!

41:04.828 --> 41:07.392
There's a dog that's
missing in my building!

41:07.680 --> 41:10.473
And that bug is lose
in there, somewhere!

41:10.724 --> 41:13.890
And what's funny, it's that same
little pooch was messing with him

41:13.893 --> 41:15.549
when I found him on my door step.

41:15.635 --> 41:18.609
So, not only does he hunts warm-
blooded animals, he holds grudges?

41:19.015 --> 41:20.645
He?
No, no, no.

41:21.202 --> 41:23.070
See, that's the other weird thing.

41:23.681 --> 41:26.007
I couldn't tell if
he was male or female.

41:26.183 --> 41:27.995
Oh, that's easy, all you
have to do is lift up his little...

41:27.996 --> 41:30.397
He doesn't have one.

41:44.287 --> 41:46.100
Malcolm Wolf!

41:49.710 --> 41:53.590
Woh!
Where did you come from?

41:53.594 --> 41:56.170
I heard you coming up the stairs.

41:59.992 --> 42:01.533
Miss Teeter!

42:01.698 --> 42:04.110
Are they kissing, Grandma?

42:06.440 --> 42:09.088
I'd like to have a word
with you, Miss Teeter.

42:09.348 --> 42:11.935
Hey Ida, can I have a kiss too?

42:16.510 --> 42:20.368
You!  You... you think that's funny?

42:23.841 --> 42:26.292
Hey! I want a kiss too!

42:28.417 --> 42:31.756
Now, you two... you two
you two...

42:31.816 --> 42:34.596
You two... you two... you two!

42:34.659 --> 42:38.644
- Hey, I think we just broke her, Ida!
- Misty!  Please!

42:40.498 --> 42:46.316
- Now, Miss Beasley , I'm sorry, but...
- Shut your mouth, you.. you...

42:46.317 --> 42:48.548
you... you... you!

42:48.920 --> 42:51.429
What you stuck on a hard for
the alphabet or something?

42:51.464 --> 42:53.939
Misty, what is wrong with you?

42:55.018 --> 43:00.767
Now, Miss Beasley, I know you
probably don't approve of us.

43:00.994 --> 43:02.673
But it is our right.

43:02.686 --> 43:06.575
Right?  Let me tell you
something, Miss Teeter.

43:06.575 --> 43:10.783
Since you don't have enough decency
to close your doors or windows,

43:11.508 --> 43:12.718
I've heard you two...

43:13.403 --> 43:14.918
I've seen you two!

43:15.467 --> 43:21.130
Are you saying it's your right to pollute
the mind of my little grand-daughter?

43:21.429 --> 43:26.903
You know she looks up to you.
Has stars in her eyes for you!

43:27.410 --> 43:30.361
And all this time, you must have been...

43:30.362 --> 43:34.203
you must have been looking at her
like she was a little piece of meat!

43:34.238 --> 43:36.860
Now wait just a goddamn minute, Lana!

43:37.057 --> 43:39.811
- How dare you?
- And I've had complaints.

43:39.846 --> 43:42.490
Complaints about your little pets!

43:42.770 --> 43:46.055
Seems one of them got lose,
and now we have a missing dog.

43:46.055 --> 43:50.763
I saw the... the filthy thing.
It ran right across my feet!

43:50.896 --> 43:54.211
They're hearing it crawling
in the walls, Miss Teeter!

43:54.491 --> 44:00.079
Yes, okay.  Jeeze.
I am missing one specimen.

44:00.196 --> 44:01.979
But that has nothing to do with the...

44:01.980 --> 44:05.381
The fact that the old bag
doesn't like clam lickers?

44:08.101 --> 44:12.820
Don't you try making trouble for
me, you party mouth little shitz!

44:13.378 --> 44:16.145
I want you out here in 14 days!

44:16.206 --> 44:17.320
Out!

44:17.837 --> 44:19.668
Give me some skin, Ida!

44:20.564 --> 44:23.125
Ow Grandma, ow.

44:23.128 --> 44:25.802
- Lana, don't do that!
- 7 days!

44:26.243 --> 44:32.653
I want you, you... deviants
out of here in 7 goddamn days!

44:35.975 --> 44:40.813
Wow!  Somebody needs to get laid.

44:48.506 --> 44:50.509
Are you okay, sweetie?

44:53.344 --> 44:58.143
How could you stand there
and laugh and make jokes,

44:58.941 --> 45:03.027
while that awful woman
was saying those things!

45:04.606 --> 45:09.693
I am sorry.  I didn't mean
to agitate the situation.

45:09.855 --> 45:12.574
And I certainly didn't
mean to make you cry.

45:12.588 --> 45:14.905
Well, I am crying, damn it!

45:15.256 --> 45:16.896
Oh, God!

45:17.171 --> 45:21.077
It's bad enough she was saying
those things about us, but Betty...

45:21.713 --> 45:24.883
Oh jeeze, Betty!

45:25.911 --> 45:29.145
- You were laughing!
- So, I was laughing!

45:29.148 --> 45:31.077
Big fat fucking deal, Ida!

45:31.464 --> 45:33.511
You are such a baby!

45:34.430 --> 45:37.485
I stand here all the day,
washing your dirty underwear,

45:37.489 --> 45:41.227
doing your dish, and feeding
your stupid fucking bugs!

45:41.335 --> 45:43.167
And you're trying give me shit?

45:43.404 --> 45:49.107
You've that cunt down the hall, the one's
you should be mad at, not me, Ida, goddamn!

45:49.238 --> 45:53.194
Misty, I...  I just...
I am sorry. I...

45:53.195 --> 45:55.009
You ungrateful whiny little bitch!

45:55.044 --> 45:58.448
I should rip your fucking eyes out,
for talking to me like that!

45:58.712 --> 46:05.285
Fuck!   Shit!
I like fucking try... fuck!

46:13.206 --> 46:15.465
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

46:27.573 --> 46:28.612
Wake up.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.315
There you go, wake up.

46:35.469 --> 46:37.341
I'm sorry about all of this.

46:38.175 --> 46:40.241
But I really need to
talk to you about your...

46:40.254 --> 46:46.930
I just had the most strangest,
most beautiful dream.

46:48.309 --> 46:52.165
I dreamt that I was a little
fairy, lying on a lily pad,

46:52.776 --> 46:57.365
and then this beautiful
giant bug landed on me,

46:57.666 --> 47:01.325
and he held my arms over, my head,

47:01.440 --> 47:04.408
and he pierced my belly
with his proboscis.

47:05.465 --> 47:10.894
And then I just laid there, as...
he poured me full his juices.

47:14.762 --> 47:16.385
What do you think it means?

47:17.740 --> 47:20.153
Maybe the bug symbolizes me.

47:21.479 --> 47:23.522
I think it's about my dad.

47:24.406 --> 47:28.073
He never really approved of me.

47:28.670 --> 47:30.390
Don't do that!

47:32.957 --> 47:35.103
We like it dark in here.

47:36.797 --> 47:38.061
We?

47:48.693 --> 47:49.593
Hello?

47:49.636 --> 47:53.300
Hey!  Got another
letter from your man in Brazil.

47:54.225 --> 47:54.950
What is wrong?

47:54.951 --> 47:59.441
I... just having problems at home.

48:00.876 --> 48:02.507
You see, I told you!
Once they moved in,

48:02.508 --> 48:05.200
they just completely transform
into something else!

48:05.217 --> 48:06.716
Max, that's enough!

48:08.091 --> 48:11.063
I'm gonna come in there right now, okay?

48:12.575 --> 48:18.477
I am worried that... maybe... Shit!
I'll just tell you when I get there!

48:18.680 --> 48:22.231
<i>Hey, mind if I open this...?
It seems like a real kick in the crotch.</i>

48:31.317 --> 48:32.441
Um...

48:33.542 --> 48:38.004
Are you gonna be
okay for about an hour?

48:51.450 --> 48:53.161
You gotta see this!

48:54.358 --> 48:57.174
Your homie from Brazil
got quite a sense humor!

48:57.268 --> 48:58.692
He's even done illustrations!

49:00.744 --> 49:01.859
Check this out.

49:03.139 --> 49:06.695
This insect is known to be inhabit the
nest of birds and other small animals

49:06.696 --> 49:08.476
where it behaves like a parasite.

49:09.457 --> 49:12.542
Inserting its proboscis and
drinking the animals' blood,

49:12.626 --> 49:15.392
replacing what it takes
with a unique toxin.

49:15.587 --> 49:17.277
Wait, there's more.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.359
This toxin the bug injects, is a protein,

49:20.619 --> 49:24.527
which once its find its way into the
bloodstream, causes mutations.

49:25.106 --> 49:27.240
It's not even physiologically possible!

49:27.249 --> 49:30.030
You can't mix an exoskeleton
with an endoskeleton!

49:30.370 --> 49:32.140
This is the best part.

49:32.167 --> 49:34.580
This protein invades the host DNA,

49:34.581 --> 49:38.228
and the bird is impregnated
with the insect's young!

49:38.871 --> 49:40.953
I think this one is
actually pretty good.

49:45.062 --> 49:46.318
You're alright?

49:47.043 --> 49:49.272
I think Misty got bit!

49:54.419 --> 49:56.379
You're yanking my chicken, right?

50:23.563 --> 50:26.282
Why don't you like me, Miss Beasley?

50:36.287 --> 50:39.177
Do you really want to know, dear?

50:39.186 --> 50:43.905
Yes.  I really want to know, dear!

50:45.733 --> 50:49.744
I don't like you, because I
think that you are perverse!

50:50.257 --> 50:55.901
You, your lady-friend, and
your disgusting little pets!

50:56.176 --> 51:00.941
I don't want scum like you within
a mile of my granddaughter!

51:01.139 --> 51:05.349
- She is a good girl, and I don't
want her exposed to a couple of...

51:05.362 --> 51:08.982
Dykes? Lesbos? Bus bumpers.
Is that what you're trying to say?

51:09.114 --> 51:12.014
You're afraid your precious little lady
bug, she's gonna grow up one day,

51:12.230 --> 51:14.639
she's gonna like other lady bugs?
Hmm?

51:14.763 --> 51:17.563
Or maybe we're gonna infect her
with some kind of pussy eating virus?

51:17.564 --> 51:22.542
- Is that's it?
- You are just foul, young lady!

51:22.560 --> 51:24.605
You're a monster!

51:26.727 --> 51:31.226
You are right.
I'm sorry, daddy!

51:32.560 --> 51:36.241
What?  Daddy?

51:36.842 --> 51:40.101
What's wrong with you?

51:55.291 --> 51:59.522
Grandma?  Can I have my
cream sandwich, now?

52:02.506 --> 52:04.411
Grandma?

52:42.085 --> 52:45.153
Baby?
Baby?

52:48.497 --> 52:50.720
My God, Misty.
What happened?

52:52.466 --> 52:54.735
Old bag fell down the stairs!

52:55.228 --> 52:59.884
Misty!  Could you just leave
us alone for a minute, please?

53:03.326 --> 53:06.489
Yeah, I'm kind of tired anyway,

53:06.490 --> 53:10.182
so I'm gonna go hit the sack,
if that's okay with you.

53:10.221 --> 53:10.937
Thanks.

53:18.911 --> 53:21.440
Please be able to call,
please be able to call...

53:21.714 --> 53:22.437
Hello?

53:22.450 --> 53:24.873
Max, can you come over
right away, please?

53:24.958 --> 53:26.900
Something terrible has happened!

53:26.923 --> 53:29.575
- Are you okay?
- I'll explain it to you when you get here.

53:29.584 --> 53:30.689
I'm there!

53:47.487 --> 53:48.779
Do you want to join me?

53:50.348 --> 53:52.145
There's nothing wrong with me.

53:54.051 --> 53:57.687
And I guess we wouldn't have to
move either with old Beasley gone, eh!

53:58.309 --> 54:01.775
The woman is dead, Misty!

54:02.894 --> 54:04.410
That's terrible!

54:07.455 --> 54:09.417
I think the bug bit you!

54:10.638 --> 54:11.935
Have you seen it?

54:13.773 --> 54:16.124
The bug?
Which one, Ida?

54:16.519 --> 54:19.126
You've got 'em all over
this flipping place, lover!

54:19.432 --> 54:22.262
You know what bug
I'm talking about, Misty.

54:22.957 --> 54:25.863
You've been hiding it, haven't you?

54:27.804 --> 54:31.711
Okay.
You got me!

54:33.005 --> 54:34.935
It's in your pillow.

54:36.734 --> 54:39.070
Well, it's a cute little guy, too!

54:57.475 --> 55:01.765
Misty?  It's infected you!

55:02.804 --> 55:05.114
You don't understand, Ida.

55:05.740 --> 55:07.868
He hasn't infected me at all!

55:08.470 --> 55:10.346
- In fact ...
- Listen to me!

55:10.569 --> 55:15.640
Misty, your father... he sent it to me,
I don't know why!  But he did.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.281
I know why he sent it to you, Ida.

55:19.126 --> 55:22.174
Why?
You know?

55:22.375 --> 55:27.947
He sent you the bug so that
it will bite you, and infects you,

55:28.040 --> 55:30.412
and makes you go fucking crazy!

55:32.124 --> 55:34.776
He wanted me to be repulsed by you!

55:36.185 --> 55:38.820
Because he know
I was in love with you!

55:40.488 --> 55:45.822
- But... I got the package before...
- I've loved you for years, Ida!

55:47.170 --> 55:52.408
I used to come to Daddy's classes,
and I would just stare at you,

55:52.889 --> 55:56.908
and draw you, for hours.

55:57.672 --> 56:00.902
I've always loved you, Ida!

56:01.599 --> 56:08.026
But it's okay, because I still have you!
And...

56:21.600 --> 56:22.697
Ida!

57:40.910 --> 57:43.043
Today, is the day.

57:44.087 --> 57:47.450
I felt them kicking all night long!

57:47.553 --> 57:49.118
You gonna beat me?

57:49.433 --> 57:52.803
I can't believe you're gonna beat
me.  I got in mine the first, you know.

57:57.291 --> 57:59.171
Do you think it will
be a boy, or a girl?

57:59.378 --> 58:02.954
Oh!
Probably a few hundred of each.

58:04.001 --> 58:07.515
You know, we should send
daddy a few hundred cigars.
