01:56.708 --> 01:57.624
Try one.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.791
It's "crispy dragon gallbladder."

02:02.750 --> 02:04.291
Take it easy.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.541
There's a lot.

02:08.542 --> 02:09.875
Take these letters with you.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.791
Hide them in the houses you just mentioned.

02:12.875 --> 02:15.333
It's dynamite.

02:15.417 --> 02:18.083
Choose the person you hate the most.

02:18.750 --> 02:19.958
Here are three pigeons.

02:20.042 --> 02:21.083
Take them back with you.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.875
And three cloth strips.

02:22.958 --> 02:23.666
Can you read?

02:23.750 --> 02:24.750
No.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.458
Three words. It means "wait a bit."

02:27.542 --> 02:29.417
Two words. "No go."

02:30.167 --> 02:32.458
One word. "Go."

02:33.500 --> 02:34.291
Got it.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.708
How many words for "go"?

02:36.875 --> 02:37.375
Two.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.374
Nonsense.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.458
There's only one word.

02:39.542 --> 02:40.958
No other smarter guy?

02:42.417 --> 02:43.917
Master, all the other villagers

02:44.000 --> 02:45.208
are too sneaky.

02:45.292 --> 02:46.542
Hard to manipulate.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.458
Big pie chu,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.750
how many words for "no go"?

02:50.208 --> 02:51.208
Two.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.333
How about "wait a bit"?

02:52.958 --> 02:53.749
Wait for what?

02:53.833 --> 02:55.624
How many words for "wait a bit"?

02:56.292 --> 02:57.083
Thr... Three words.

02:57.167 --> 02:59.208
Make sure you memorize them.

02:59.292 --> 03:01.875
If screw up, I will peel your skin!

03:01.958 --> 03:02.749
When everything is done,

03:02.833 --> 03:04.749
you will have a house in the city.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.499
Master will also give you 20 gold coins.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.125
Thank you.

03:09.167 --> 03:11.042
Retrieve the kites.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.000
Didn't you know those two people?

03:13.083 --> 03:15.708
Those were chao and his wife.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.125
They couldn't pay off their debt.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.374
So master sent them both

03:19.458 --> 03:20.958
up to heaven.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.833
You just ate the skin of a human face.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.292
A little bit thick.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.416
You can leave now.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.667
Master,

03:38.750 --> 03:40.601
wouldn't it be easier
if just ask the "cloud clan"

03:40.625 --> 03:41.684
to attack the village directly?

03:41.708 --> 03:42.874
Why so complicated?

03:45.167 --> 03:46.875
When bandits do bad things,

03:46.958 --> 03:49.249
better look like doing something bad.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.833
When we do bad things,

03:50.917 --> 03:52.792
better look like we are doing
something good.

03:54.042 --> 03:55.522
Is the village really a "dragon pit"?

03:56.500 --> 03:59.083
The fortune-teller won't be wrong.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.083
He said my father was buried there.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.042
Someday I will become an emperor,

04:03.125 --> 04:05.750
as long as I take over the village.

04:05.833 --> 04:06.749
It shouldn't be too much trouble, right?

04:06.833 --> 04:07.958
It shouldn't be.

04:17.708 --> 04:19.166
Any mail for desire village?

04:22.083 --> 04:23.166
There was one letter.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.458
I just delivered it.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.625
A train is coming!

04:42.042 --> 04:43.208
A train is coming!

04:45.458 --> 04:46.708
A train is coming!

04:50.375 --> 04:51.416
Make way for the train!

04:53.625 --> 04:54.458
Hurry up!

04:54.542 --> 04:55.625
What train?

04:55.708 --> 04:57.416
Major event! A train!

04:57.500 --> 04:58.833
Go. Go.

04:58.917 --> 04:59.917
Hurry up!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.458
I can't pass. Hurry up!

05:01.833 --> 05:03.291
Come on! What train?

06:19.667 --> 06:20.792
A train is coming!

06:22.000 --> 06:23.875
A train is coming!

06:23.958 --> 06:25.749
What? A train is coming!

06:25.833 --> 06:27.541
What is a train?

06:27.792 --> 06:28.917
What train?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.518
When I went out to gather
some medicinal herbs today,

06:30.542 --> 06:32.059
I bumped into big cow from the next town.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.166
He told me that

06:33.250 --> 06:34.000
a railroad is going to be built, and

06:34.083 --> 06:35.833
it will go through our village.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.768
It's very possible they are building
a train station here.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.125
What's a train station?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.541
Pigs live on farms;

06:40.625 --> 06:41.750
Cows, in stables;

06:41.833 --> 06:43.333
And trains, at train stations.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.476
I just came back from the city.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.780
How come I didn't hear anything?

06:46.833 --> 06:47.833
It's a secret.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.101
You are not supposed to broadcast it.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.666
This is wonderful news!

06:50.750 --> 06:52.350
I started the village over 20 years ago.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.791
Finally it's time for us to strike it rich.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.416
How so, chief?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.416
I may not have seen a train before,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
but I've heard
how trains carry tons of money

06:59.583 --> 07:00.374
and dump it into train stations every day.

07:00.458 --> 07:03.749
People living near
the train stations are all loaded.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.458
Ok.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.809
Let's prepare some nice dishes tonight

07:07.833 --> 07:08.958
and celebrate.

07:09.042 --> 07:09.917
Big pie!

07:10.000 --> 07:11.476
I want to eat your "tyrant's chicken stew."

07:11.500 --> 07:12.916
Umm... Sure.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.208
Hold on. Why are you carrying
those bird cages?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.510
To make some "tyrant's
'bird' stew" for you.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.555
Even big pie knows
how to crack a joke now.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.333
Little pie, here's some candy for you.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.583
Come, let me release your shackle.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.041
Let me tell you this.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.958
Gather everything you need
and pack up tonight.

07:46.875 --> 07:47.875
Why?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.875
I am going to make your life better soon.

07:51.958 --> 07:54.416
We are moving to the city.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.625
Why are we moving to the city?

07:56.708 --> 07:59.291
Anyway, your life is gonna get better.

08:27.625 --> 08:28.750
What are you doing?

08:31.083 --> 08:33.207
Aren't you going to make
some "tyrant's 'bird' stew"?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.332
We only have two birds left...

08:43.250 --> 08:44.541
My dear fellow villagers,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.125
tonight let's eat and drink to
our hearts' content.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.708
Pretty soon we will all be rich.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.500
Maybe my son will ride the train home.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.643
Let me raise my cup to you all!

08:54.667 --> 08:55.958
Ride the train home?

08:56.042 --> 08:57.458
You are day-dreaming.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.250
Trains are monsters.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.958
Railroads will destroy our feng shui.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.042
My fellow villagers,

09:03.083 --> 09:04.958
no trains to our village.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.476
Not only allowing the
trains to our village,

09:06.500 --> 09:07.916
I'll also have the train station

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
built on the land right by the entrance

09:10.083 --> 09:11.124
where the house named Lee.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.291
That's my school!

09:12.375 --> 09:13.518
That's why I am tearing it down.

09:13.542 --> 09:14.875
Who authorize you do that?

09:14.958 --> 09:16.458
Because I am the chief.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.042
I started this village.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.458
You guys all came after I did,

09:19.542 --> 09:20.375
didn't you?

09:20.458 --> 09:22.416
You... You shameless,

09:22.500 --> 09:23.791
evil-looking scoundrel!

09:23.875 --> 09:25.235
Who are you calling a "scoundrel"?

09:29.750 --> 09:30.750
Let's go.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.083
Why does he look so dark?

09:47.167 --> 09:48.917
Dr. liu.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.250
There you are. Why don't you
go over and take a look?

09:57.958 --> 09:59.749
What happened, Autumn?

10:00.458 --> 10:02.458
I... I don't know.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.292
I went out to fetch some water.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.893
When I came back, I found him like this.

10:05.917 --> 10:06.750
What is it?

10:06.833 --> 10:07.541
He's dead.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.041
He's dead.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.541
It looks like he was poisoned,

10:10.625 --> 10:11.905
or got struck by bubonic plague.

10:13.167 --> 10:13.792
Bubonic plague?

10:13.875 --> 10:16.208
Hurry up! Carry the body outside
and set him on fire!

10:16.292 --> 10:17.667
Hurry up and carry...

10:17.750 --> 10:18.791
Come over here!

10:20.292 --> 10:21.917
Chief, you can't set him on fire.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.375
This could be a homicide.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.018
We need to report it to authorities
for a thorough investigation.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.851
Report to authorities?
Then the trains won't come.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.934
What... What's more important?
A train or a person's life?

10:28.958 --> 10:30.184
Dr. liu said it's bubonic plague.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.333
Why are you so fussy?

10:31.417 --> 10:32.000
You...

10:32.083 --> 10:33.499
Big bro is sleeping.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.499
I'll sleep with you.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.375
Where was I?

10:45.458 --> 10:46.916
Why are you so fussy?

10:49.375 --> 10:50.708
My fellow villagers,

10:50.792 --> 10:52.500
the murderer must be among us.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.499
If you burn up big pie's body in a hurry,

10:54.583 --> 10:56.958
you are trying to destroy the evidence.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.166
Destroy the evidence? That's not right.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.125
Right. Why do
I have to destroy the evidence?

11:01.208 --> 11:03.208
You are the suspect. Arrest him!

12:05.750 --> 12:09.416
I am a lay monk. "Rainbow" is my alias.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.833
My real name is fortune tien.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.583
I am a well-travelled man
who happened to pass by your village.

12:15.667 --> 12:20.167
I saw an aura appearing right
above your area.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.184
That's a lucky sign indicating
your community is sitting

12:26.208 --> 12:29.374
on a land of good feng shui.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.374
If you don't mind,

12:31.458 --> 12:35.374
I'd like to stay here for a couple days
to practice meditation.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.791
I am the village chief.

12:41.875 --> 12:45.750
Unfortunately there's been a death
in our village,

12:45.833 --> 12:47.726
so it's not appropriate for us
to take in visitors.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.750
Oh my!

12:57.583 --> 12:58.583
Oh my!

12:59.417 --> 13:01.708
This poison that killed him
was not just poisonous

13:01.792 --> 13:03.833
but also deadly.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.792
It will stop the body from decaying
because no bugs will touch it.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.750
The body will not decay.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.499
It must be Autumn.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.874
Tie her up!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.124
Chief!

13:14.208 --> 13:15.848
There's no way Autumn could have done it.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.458
Where did the poison come from?

13:17.542 --> 13:18.684
Of course it's her. Who else?

13:18.708 --> 13:19.624
I meant well for her

13:19.708 --> 13:21.333
when I married her off to big pie.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.583
But she hated him.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.792
How many times has she
tried to run away in vain?

13:24.875 --> 13:27.166
This time she finally decided
to kill her husband.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.291
You meant well for me?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.625
You sold me to big pie
for a couple of pigs.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.208
How ungrateful! Are you even human?

13:33.292 --> 13:34.351
I supported and raised her
for so many years.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.708
Instead of returning the favor,
she is seeking revenge.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.472
If we keep her, we are keeping a disaster.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.083
Put her in the pig cage tomorrow.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.500
Chief, give me three days.

13:42.583 --> 13:43.874
I will find the murderer.

13:44.583 --> 13:45.999
No need for that.

13:46.958 --> 13:51.458
Chief, I can find the murderer now.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.958
How?

13:54.042 --> 13:56.792
Please follow me.

14:01.042 --> 14:04.167
This box looks just like an antique.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.166
I wonder what's inside.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.833
Inside the box is...

14:09.917 --> 14:13.167
The "worry ridder."

14:13.250 --> 14:15.333
The "worry ridder."

14:15.417 --> 14:16.917
What is that?

14:26.083 --> 14:27.708
Every one of us

14:27.792 --> 14:31.083
has an untold secret.

14:31.167 --> 14:34.625
If you keep it inside too long,
it becomes a source of discomfort.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.208
Pretty soon it will make you sick.

14:38.292 --> 14:41.167
You might as well remove it

14:41.250 --> 14:43.708
and forget about it.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.958
Which dynasty was this thing from?

14:48.042 --> 14:49.667
It was from...

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
The zhou dynasty.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.142
Did they have brass in the zhou dynasty?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.624
Zhou dynasty...

14:56.708 --> 14:58.308
Have you ever lived in the zhou dynasty?

15:01.833 --> 15:04.916
I can tell right away you are very good
at what you do.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.958
You must be hungry
after such a long journey.

15:07.042 --> 15:09.000
Bring out your best wine
and food, everyone!

15:09.292 --> 15:10.417
Chief!

15:12.500 --> 15:14.208
What are you doing, uncle Lin?

15:14.292 --> 15:16.518
These pigs were born from
the sperms of the male pigs that I raised.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.934
Time for them to come home
and see where they came from.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.226
Guess the pigs share your last name then?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.333
They are the descendants of the Lin family.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.375
Big pie owed me money.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
He owed me money, too.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.083
Don't touch anything in the kitchen.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.327
I still need to look into it.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.208
Doctor!

15:30.292 --> 15:31.812
Seriously, you are taking the blanket?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.541
I brewed this wine myself...
For special guests only.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.666
Let's welcome rainbow
the lay monk together.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.833
You can stay here for as long as you like.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.958
Let's raise our cups to him.

15:46.042 --> 15:48.000
Blessings and long life to you!

15:48.833 --> 15:52.291
Blessings and long life to you!

15:52.375 --> 15:54.250
Thank you, chief!

15:54.333 --> 15:55.624
I wish all of you

15:55.708 --> 15:59.249
blessings and long life as well.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.041
I'll drink to that first.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.041
Bottoms up!

16:16.083 --> 16:17.666
Have some more wine.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.750
Sure.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.166
Thank you, chief!

16:23.250 --> 16:26.041
Your warm and friendly welcome

16:26.125 --> 16:29.083
has touched me greatly.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.167
I wish all of you

16:31.250 --> 16:34.791
blessings and long life as well.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.208
I'll drink to that.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.000
Scholar Lee,

17:00.083 --> 17:01.124
you are well read.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.124
In your experience,
what do you think this is?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.040
Rainbow, the lay monk, said

17:07.125 --> 17:09.708
this thing was from the zhou dynasty,

17:10.250 --> 17:12.500
which reminds me of a legend.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.540
Tell us about it.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.833
There was an official in the zhou dynasty.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.416
He had this precious instrument.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.958
People said it could remove worries.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.165
And then what?

17:29.417 --> 17:30.667
I forgot.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.416
You suck at telling stories.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.375
Anyway.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.083
We've gained a treasure today.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.167
Chief,

17:38.208 --> 17:40.083
why don't we sell it

17:40.167 --> 17:41.875
and split up the profit?

17:41.958 --> 17:43.249
Of course we'll sell it.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.373
But we'll use the profit to build
the train station.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.666
All right. Nobody takes anything.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.510
What are you doing?
You're still wearing it.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.458
Where are my clothes?

17:57.167 --> 17:58.167
Where are my shoes?

17:58.208 --> 17:59.124
Where's my precious instrument?

17:59.208 --> 18:00.448
Where's my precious instrument?

18:01.208 --> 18:02.124
I've been robbed!

18:02.208 --> 18:03.249
I've been robbed!

18:04.500 --> 18:06.916
What kind of village is this?!

18:22.917 --> 18:24.750
You are

18:24.833 --> 18:26.249
the wife of the dead guy.

18:29.958 --> 18:32.499
People say when a hare dies,
even a fox will be sad.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.333
You can't avoid the sadness.

18:36.417 --> 18:37.125
You are only human.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.541
Hey, what are you doing?

18:39.625 --> 18:42.416
Your husband just died.
I am not a heartless man.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.416
I am rainbow the lay monk.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.875
However, it was unfortunate.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.351
You and him... It's like a beautiful flower
planted in a pile of stinky cow poo.

18:49.375 --> 18:50.416
Fortunately,

18:50.500 --> 18:52.166
the flower hasn't lost its petals,

18:52.250 --> 18:53.958
even though the cow poo is gone.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.000
What are you doing?

18:56.083 --> 18:56.916
Hey, hey!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Stop!

19:00.250 --> 19:01.458
Don't kill yourself.

19:01.542 --> 19:02.542
What are you doing?

19:06.667 --> 19:07.667
Move away!

19:09.208 --> 19:10.208
Move away!

19:10.625 --> 19:11.625
What are you guys doing?

19:13.792 --> 19:14.667
Move away!

19:14.750 --> 19:15.833
What are you doing? Help!

19:16.542 --> 19:17.917
I... I'll go get a stool.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.083
Forget about the stool.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.708
Save her first.

19:23.542 --> 19:24.125
My hand...

19:24.208 --> 19:26.124
My hand...

19:26.208 --> 19:27.208
My hand...

19:27.250 --> 19:28.791
You're stepping on my hand!

19:30.333 --> 19:32.916
Oh, my hand.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.500
Autumn,

19:37.583 --> 19:39.249
don't be silly.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.874
Killing yourself won't solve the problem.

19:42.958 --> 19:43.624
Your husband is dead. So what?

19:43.708 --> 19:45.083
Just find another one.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.250
Right.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.333
Autumn,

19:47.417 --> 19:49.458
I found these two letters
on big pie's body.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.083
They could be his suicide notes.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.375
Take a look.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.500
She just tried to kill herself, right?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.559
You think she would be in the mood to read
some suicide notes.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.666
Let me read them to you. Untie me.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.791
Untie me.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.750
You can read it this way.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.416
Why did you tie me up?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.541
I didn't tie you up.

20:12.625 --> 20:13.416
They wanted your precious instrument.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.000
My job is just to watch you.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.958
Untie me then.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.542
I didn't tie you up,

20:18.583 --> 20:19.958
so I can't untie you.

20:20.042 --> 20:20.708
Understood?

20:20.792 --> 20:21.958
I know you didn't tie me up.

20:22.042 --> 20:23.542
That's why you can untie me.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.208
If you had been the one to tie me up,

20:24.292 --> 20:25.726
I wouldn't be asking you now to untie me.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.416
Understood?

20:26.500 --> 20:27.750
No.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.333
Read it.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.083
It's upside down.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.125
"To: Chief Wang..."

20:37.208 --> 20:38.208
And then what?

20:38.542 --> 20:39.958
The letter is inside the envelope.

20:45.792 --> 20:47.434
“Dear uncle Wong
the double-faced evil monster,

20:47.458 --> 20:49.059
your people have gone
undercover for years.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.833
For the purpose of this particular battle.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.042
It's time for you to succeed and shine.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.875
Take the dynamite and wait for my notice.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.643
Charge into the city court
and occupy the city.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.226
"Sincerely, dark cloud of the cloud clan"

20:58.250 --> 20:59.541
bark cloud

20:59.625 --> 21:00.625
bark cloud?

21:00.917 --> 21:01.958
Dark cloud!

21:05.208 --> 21:06.208
Dr. liu

21:06.750 --> 21:08.110
the letter is inside the envelope.

21:11.708 --> 21:13.268
"Dear county sheriff liu-the dark wind
and poisonous rain,

21:13.292 --> 21:15.268
please follow the order of
the double-faced evil monster.

21:15.292 --> 21:18.208
Take golden Lin, the mercy Buddha
with a thousand hands,

21:18.292 --> 21:20.917
and scholar Lee,
the cold-blooded heart-eating ghost.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.166
Charge into the city court
and occupy the city.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.083
Sincerely, dark cloud

21:24.167 --> 21:25.000
of the "cloud clan"

21:25.083 --> 21:27.476
the cloud clan is made up of a bunch
of robbers who kill and steal.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.041
Dark cloud is their leader.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.685
I've lived here a bit over three years.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.208
Autumn,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.167
did you know they are bandits?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.541
Of course they are!

21:36.625 --> 21:38.666
Otherwise why would
they tie me up like this?

21:38.750 --> 21:40.309
Could they have anything to do
with big pie's death?

21:40.333 --> 21:42.013
Maybe that's why he was poisoned to death.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.167
I have an idea.

21:43.417 --> 21:44.417
Come with me.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.917
Come. Follow me.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.500
Can I go with you, too?

21:56.875 --> 21:58.416
Did you see big pie eat anything?

21:59.875 --> 22:00.875
No.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.666
This stinks.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.500
Maybe this was the wrapper for the poison.

22:14.917 --> 22:15.958
Pigeons.

22:16.042 --> 22:17.500
Where did they come from?

22:17.583 --> 22:19.458
Big pie brought them back.

22:19.542 --> 22:20.417
There were three of them.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.708
I killed one.

22:22.125 --> 22:22.875
Cloth strips.

22:22.958 --> 22:23.958
Words.

22:24.917 --> 22:26.077
I think I know what happened.

22:37.458 --> 22:38.624
These are messenger pigeons.

22:39.833 --> 22:40.708
For what?

22:40.792 --> 22:42.072
There are two cloth strips here.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.541
I can't read.

22:48.292 --> 22:50.458
This one says, "go" and...

22:50.542 --> 22:51.625
This one, "wait a bit."

22:52.417 --> 22:53.893
What did the one that just flew away say?

22:53.917 --> 22:54.917
What?

22:57.458 --> 22:57.958
No worries.

22:58.042 --> 22:59.042
Let me go get it back.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.125
Sorry, ma'am.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.291
Spying.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.000
I am going to be a rich man soon!

23:39.083 --> 23:39.874
Who is it?

23:39.958 --> 23:41.541
It's me. Open the door.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.000
What are you doing here?

23:43.083 --> 23:44.124
Go home now.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.333
No, I won't.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.417
Take me with you now.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.333
Did you get the money?

23:48.417 --> 23:49.125
No.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.608
How can we leave without the money?

23:51.958 --> 23:52.666
Let's go.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.583
No.

23:53.667 --> 23:54.375
Let's go.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.138
Why are you poking holes
through my window?

23:56.917 --> 23:58.667
Let's go.

23:58.750 --> 23:59.458
Are you out of your mind?

23:59.542 --> 24:01.262
I won't take you with me without the money.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.708
I know.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.875
You are always fascinated by Autumn.

24:05.958 --> 24:07.666
Now she's being a widow,

24:07.750 --> 24:09.541
do you want me to make
your dream come true?

24:09.625 --> 24:10.625
Really? Thank you.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.583
You...

24:12.667 --> 24:13.542
Let's go.

24:13.625 --> 24:14.875
Stop poking!

24:14.958 --> 24:15.833
Let's go.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.583
Stop poking! Please.

24:17.667 --> 24:18.667
Let's go.

24:27.917 --> 24:28.957
I didn't catch the pigeon,

24:29.000 --> 24:30.083
but guess what I found?

24:30.167 --> 24:30.958
What?

24:31.042 --> 24:32.125
A bag of dynamite.

24:32.208 --> 24:32.749
It looks like

24:32.833 --> 24:34.233
they are really going for a revolt.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.083
The pigeon that I just set free,

24:37.167 --> 24:39.333
maybe it was used to contact the bandits.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.125
What did the cloth strip say?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.999
Do you think they'll act right away?

24:43.083 --> 24:45.416
Why don't you release "wait a bit" then?

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
That makes sense.

24:48.083 --> 24:49.268
How many words are there in "wait a bit"?

24:49.292 --> 24:49.833
Six.

24:49.917 --> 24:50.500
Oh, thank you.

24:50.583 --> 24:51.583
It's three!

24:52.417 --> 24:52.958
Liar!

24:53.042 --> 24:54.042
Moron!

24:59.542 --> 25:00.875
Autumn, you should leave now.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.398
This place is the bandits' home-base.

25:03.625 --> 25:04.684
You wanted to run away from big pie
so badly before.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.428
Now that he's dead, why aren't you leaving?

25:07.875 --> 25:09.083
You are waiting for Dean Wang.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.500
Who's Dean Wang?

25:10.583 --> 25:11.624
He's not coming back.

25:11.708 --> 25:12.458
He'll be back soon.

25:12.542 --> 25:13.125
When is he coming back?

25:13.208 --> 25:14.408
How did you know he'd be back?

25:16.125 --> 25:18.291
This morning

25:18.375 --> 25:20.500
a mail deliverer visited me.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.417
Autumn Chang!

25:25.583 --> 25:26.708
It's me.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.333
<i>Dear Autumn, how are you?</i>

25:50.417 --> 25:51.875
<i>It's been three years since I left.</i>

25:51.958 --> 25:53.458
<i>I am hoping to return home soon.</i>

25:53.542 --> 25:55.018
<i>Hope we can relive our dream together.</i>

25:55.042 --> 25:57.000
This morning

25:57.083 --> 25:59.208
a mail deliverer visited me.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.666
I received a letter

26:03.708 --> 26:05.708
from Dean.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.249
I'd been waiting for him for three years.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.791
Finally he was coming home soon.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.000
But I felt like dying.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.666
Because I had married big pie chu,

26:17.750 --> 26:19.625
I felt too ashamed to see Dean.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.333
Right at that moment,

26:21.417 --> 26:24.625
I saw little pie lying
next to a dead chicken...

26:26.625 --> 26:27.916
Little pie.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.666
Show me that pack over there.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.624
I am not sure where the poison came from.

26:36.708 --> 26:39.291
The universe probably sent it
to me to set me free.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.875
The poison had a very strong odor.

26:44.792 --> 26:47.042
I almost puked as soon as
I placed it near my mouth.

26:48.583 --> 26:52.041
Later on, I thought about placing
the drug in a bun.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.005
It would probably be easier
to take it that way.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.417
Then I cut up some green onions,

27:03.500 --> 27:05.583
and added some pickled cabbage
and chili pepper.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.333
I thought to myself,

27:09.417 --> 27:11.292
this should make everything tastier.

27:16.542 --> 27:18.333
So, did you eat it?

27:25.875 --> 27:27.041
No.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.958
A train is coming!

27:31.042 --> 27:33.333
Because big pie came home.

27:33.417 --> 27:36.042
He said he was taking me to the city.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.750
I thought, "I don't have to worry about
seeing Dean any more."

27:40.417 --> 27:41.792
And then what?

27:42.958 --> 27:45.708
And then big pie wanted to cook.

27:45.792 --> 27:48.417
I killed one of his pigeons.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.708
He seemed furious, but

27:50.792 --> 27:52.958
he held his anger in.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.708
He then told me to fetch some water.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.292
When I came back with the water,

27:59.375 --> 28:01.833
I saw him cooking.

28:04.792 --> 28:06.375
He must be really hungry.

28:06.458 --> 28:08.041
He saw the bun next to him.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.291
He wanted to eat it.

28:09.375 --> 28:10.625
Did you stop him?

28:12.625 --> 28:14.375
I was going to.

28:26.292 --> 28:27.750
But then I thought,

28:30.083 --> 28:31.874
"if big pie's dead,

28:33.292 --> 28:36.417
then I can be reunited with Dean."

29:10.125 --> 29:13.333
I think... I deserve to die.

29:13.417 --> 29:16.250
How could I have done such a thing?

29:16.333 --> 29:18.333
Even if Dean is back,

29:18.417 --> 29:20.625
I can't carry this sin of mine

29:20.708 --> 29:22.541
and live with him for the rest of life.

29:23.417 --> 29:24.750
Don't worry.

29:24.833 --> 29:27.374
If the universe arranged
the poison for you,

29:27.458 --> 29:29.999
I am sure it would also make arrangements
for me to save you.

29:30.083 --> 29:32.666
My specialty is helping people
get rid of hatred

29:32.750 --> 29:34.291
and guilt.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.415
Do you do it
with that precious instrument of yours?

29:36.750 --> 29:37.625
Yes.

29:37.708 --> 29:40.124
Even if you get rid of my sin,

29:40.750 --> 29:42.291
what I did was already done.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.695
If you forget about what you did,

29:45.083 --> 29:47.083
then you didn't really do it.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.333
Give it a try.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.667
It really wasn't your fault.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.917
Why don't you untie me, master wan.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.541
Let's go and get
my precious instrument back.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.458
No, I don't steal.

30:01.542 --> 30:02.667
Besides,

30:02.750 --> 30:04.350
it's time for me to practice meditation.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.083
Come on.

30:05.167 --> 30:06.292
What do you mean "stealing"?

30:06.375 --> 30:07.684
I am taking back what's rightfully mine.

30:07.708 --> 30:09.374
How's that stealing?

30:13.917 --> 30:15.583
Why don't you loosen me up?

30:15.667 --> 30:18.042
I can turn your life around

30:18.125 --> 30:20.500
so you won't be so miserable any more.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.416
Easy. Easy!

30:31.083 --> 30:32.333
Turn.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.375
Not "around."

30:38.458 --> 30:40.749
"Over."

30:40.833 --> 30:42.166
Over the fence?

30:50.958 --> 30:52.038
I'll open the door for you.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.666
No need.

30:53.750 --> 30:54.875
You go.

30:54.958 --> 30:56.124
Why me again?

30:56.208 --> 30:57.249
Of course it's you.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.833
Because you are already in there.

30:58.917 --> 31:00.958
Then what are you doing here?

31:01.042 --> 31:02.917
Are we seriously
going to talk about this now?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.625
He's going to wake up soon.

31:05.625 --> 31:07.625
Go!

31:16.083 --> 31:18.249
Oh, Dean my son,

31:21.792 --> 31:23.542
it's been three years.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.833
The moon is so bright tonight.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.374
Do you know if there are four baboons

31:32.458 --> 31:33.874
in your village?

31:46.750 --> 31:48.000
Where are you going?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.125
Don't jump!

31:57.375 --> 31:58.750
What are you trying to do?

32:03.375 --> 32:05.250
What a weird day!

32:05.333 --> 32:06.768
How come so many people
want to kill themselves?

32:06.792 --> 32:08.500
Stop pulling me!

32:09.792 --> 32:11.375
I told you already.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.018
I can help you get rid of your worries.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.542
Eh? What are they doing?

32:35.417 --> 32:36.792
So there you are!

32:38.375 --> 32:39.750
These two are my assistants.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.208
This is "no pain,"

32:41.292 --> 32:43.083
and this is "no itch."

33:03.833 --> 33:06.708
What did you bring us here for?

33:09.333 --> 33:10.333
Come.

33:23.375 --> 33:24.666
Hang on.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.708
Is it going to hurt?

33:28.750 --> 33:31.833
No more than the pain in your heart.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.833
Now,

33:34.917 --> 33:36.875
tell me your worries.

33:36.958 --> 33:40.333
I'll help you forget them.

33:40.417 --> 33:41.833
Wait.

33:41.917 --> 33:43.583
I... I am a little scared.

33:44.292 --> 33:45.792
What are you scared of?

33:45.875 --> 33:47.184
You were not afraid to die earlier,

33:47.208 --> 33:48.791
and now you are scared?

33:50.333 --> 33:51.333
You are right.

33:53.375 --> 33:55.791
Now you can tell me.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.625
Last year during the mid-Autumn festival,

34:01.708 --> 34:03.124
I fell in love with Dr. liu.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.708
Slowly I grew attached to him.

34:06.792 --> 34:08.167
I thought about him every day.

34:17.792 --> 34:18.667
Later on,

34:18.750 --> 34:20.416
I got tired of my husband golden Lin.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.791
I cursed him every day,

34:22.875 --> 34:25.000
often wishing him dead.

34:25.083 --> 34:26.708
Because only when he is dead

34:26.792 --> 34:27.893
can I legitimately marry Dr. liu

34:27.917 --> 34:30.167
and become his wife.

34:30.917 --> 34:32.208
Until yesterday.

34:32.292 --> 34:33.833
Dr. liu gave me a pack of drug.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.958
He wanted me to slip it into golden's food.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.750
I knew what kind of drug it was.

34:39.458 --> 34:42.748
I thought, "finally, my dream
is about to come true."

34:42.833 --> 34:44.748
But I got scared.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.458
I tossed out the drug.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.542
Little did I know it would cause
big pie's death.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.375
Even though I wasn't the murderer,

34:52.917 --> 34:57.417
I indirectly caused his death.

34:57.583 --> 35:01.249
I want to forget
all of those unpleasant things.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.375
<i>Goodbye.</i>

35:07.375 --> 35:08.791
Open your eyes now.

35:13.375 --> 35:14.375
Who am I?

35:15.125 --> 35:16.958
Aren't you the man
that removed my worries?

35:18.292 --> 35:20.417
What worries did you
ask me to remove for you?

35:22.792 --> 35:23.875
I can't remember.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.583
Are you happy?

35:25.667 --> 35:26.750
Of course!

35:26.833 --> 35:28.041
Why did you ask me that?

35:28.125 --> 35:29.750
You can go now.

35:29.833 --> 35:30.833
Ok.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.541
Now it's your turn.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.708
What worries do you want to forget?

35:48.833 --> 35:50.791
One year at most.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.791
I'll come back and marry you.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.708
Hold on.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.999
I am not ready to forget.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.208
Let me tell you this.

36:03.292 --> 36:05.167
Right now in front of you

36:05.250 --> 36:07.250
there are only two options.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.249
Option 1:

36:08.333 --> 36:10.541
You don't forget your old lover,

36:10.625 --> 36:13.333
and you live in pain for
the rest of your life.

36:13.417 --> 36:15.458
Option 2: You forget your old lover,

36:15.542 --> 36:17.708
and you start a brand new life.

36:17.792 --> 36:19.125
Which option will you choose?

36:19.708 --> 36:20.208
Option 2g

36:20.292 --> 36:20.833
choose option 2!

36:20.917 --> 36:21.625
Choose option 2!

36:21.708 --> 36:22.708
Who's over there?

36:23.125 --> 36:23.625
Me.

36:23.708 --> 36:24.893
You... Aren't you supposed
to be meditating?

36:24.917 --> 36:25.500
I am done.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.083
That was quick.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.309
Pick option 2. Pick option 2.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.624
I'll choose option 3.

36:30.542 --> 36:32.208
If I can wait

36:32.292 --> 36:34.208
until Dean comes back,

36:35.292 --> 36:37.083
I'll take one last look at him,

36:37.167 --> 36:38.167
and then kill myself.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.542
Or if he comes home,

36:42.500 --> 36:44.666
and I am already dead,

36:46.625 --> 36:48.250
then at least he can visit my grave

36:48.333 --> 36:50.083
and burn some incense to show respect.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.965
You are still thinking
about killing yourself!

36:56.833 --> 36:57.833
Master,

36:57.917 --> 36:59.375
two pigeons just returned.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.750
Which two?

37:01.833 --> 37:02.624
"Wait a bit" and

37:02.708 --> 37:03.749
"wait a bit."

37:03.833 --> 37:04.874
"No go."

37:04.958 --> 37:06.249
Which one flew back first?

37:06.833 --> 37:07.666
Not sure.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.166
Bastard!

37:09.250 --> 37:10.916
Find me the leader of the cloud clan.

37:15.042 --> 37:17.292
You've been helping us
for so many years now.

37:17.375 --> 37:18.916
Little did I know

37:19.000 --> 37:21.875
the leader of the cloud clan
is a mail deliverer.

37:21.958 --> 37:23.833
No wonder the officials
can never catch you.

37:25.458 --> 37:27.291
I like being a mail deliverer.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.625
I deliver mail. I deliver death.

37:29.708 --> 37:30.791
I like doing both.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.541
You like delivering stuff?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.185
I've got a gift delivered just for you.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.333
This is called "iron horse."

37:44.417 --> 37:45.500
For you.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.958
I already inspected the village.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.601
All my buddies are lurking
outside the village.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.666
They are ready to charge into it any time.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.208
Here's a messenger pigeon for you.

37:54.292 --> 37:55.643
There's a cloth strip tied around its foot,

37:55.667 --> 37:57.625
which says "go."

37:57.708 --> 37:58.749
If there are no issues,

37:58.833 --> 38:00.416
let it fly back to me with the message.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.833
Make sure everything is fool-proof.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.458
I am a scholar.

38:08.542 --> 38:09.875
I can't afford to let people say

38:09.958 --> 38:11.999
lam a murderer.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.708
Ok.

38:17.708 --> 38:18.874
Hold on.

38:18.958 --> 38:20.791
We are now living in a Republic.

38:20.875 --> 38:21.934
Why are you still wearing your old uniform

38:21.958 --> 38:23.083
from the ching dynasty?

38:24.167 --> 38:25.917
The new one doesn't look good on me.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.792
What's going on with big sis?

38:41.875 --> 38:43.583
We've been waiting for several days.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.708
Why don't we just charge into the village?

38:46.750 --> 38:48.166
Big sis wants us

38:48.250 --> 38:50.583
to wait so we wait.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.708
We are the cloud clan.

38:52.792 --> 38:54.667
If the clouds dissipate,

38:54.750 --> 38:56.833
we'll be good for nothing at all.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.000
What is that?

39:06.083 --> 39:07.833
I learned it from the gweilo.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.375
Good morning, Dr. liu.

39:44.458 --> 39:45.999
Good morning.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.333
Eh, how come your window has holes?

39:48.417 --> 39:49.542
You did it.

39:49.625 --> 39:50.958
I did?

39:53.917 --> 39:55.625
When did I poke those holes
in your window?

39:56.417 --> 39:58.042
Stop pretending.

39:58.125 --> 39:59.333
Are you mad at me?

40:00.417 --> 40:02.500
It was my fault last night.

40:03.083 --> 40:03.958
Why don't you give it another try?

40:04.042 --> 40:05.250
Once you get the money,

40:05.333 --> 40:06.416
we'll leave.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.333
What's wrong with you, Dr. liu?

40:09.417 --> 40:10.583
You are not making any sense.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.307
I have no idea what you're talking about.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.125
My fellow villagers,

40:15.208 --> 40:16.458
you found out yesterday

40:16.542 --> 40:19.083
how important trains are to our village.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.375
When the trains come,
we'll all strike it rich.

40:21.458 --> 40:24.041
To make sure they come and stay,

40:24.125 --> 40:26.875
we'll need to build a train station.

40:26.958 --> 40:27.833
To build a train station,

40:27.917 --> 40:29.583
we'll need money.

40:29.667 --> 40:32.125
Do you want the trains
to bring wealth to us?

40:32.208 --> 40:33.291
Yes.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.015
Then why don't we have each family donate

40:35.042 --> 40:36.375
some money to the project?

40:36.458 --> 40:39.291
No.

40:39.375 --> 40:40.768
I ask you for money, and you say "no."

40:40.792 --> 40:41.792
Get out of here!

40:43.750 --> 40:44.750
Chief,

40:44.833 --> 40:46.541
I have something to report to you.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.250
The lay monk who came last night,

40:48.333 --> 40:49.374
he is really sinister.

40:49.458 --> 40:50.458
What's wrong?

40:50.500 --> 40:51.540
We tied him up completely,

40:51.583 --> 40:52.291
but he managed to go

40:52.375 --> 40:53.291
and play tricks on spring.

40:53.375 --> 40:55.708
Let her forget all the worries.

40:55.792 --> 40:57.583
All her worries?

40:58.458 --> 40:59.749
It's gone.

41:04.458 --> 41:05.541
Tell me,

41:05.625 --> 41:07.125
where's the treasure box?

41:07.542 --> 41:08.542
Under the bed.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.250
Take a look.

41:15.083 --> 41:15.791
It was under my bed.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.795
How did it manage to place itself
under this bed?

41:19.583 --> 41:21.541
Between one bed and another,

41:21.625 --> 41:24.208
there is an untold secret.

41:24.292 --> 41:25.958
An ordinary man like you

41:26.042 --> 41:27.625
will never get it.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.666
Only I know how to operate
the worry ridder.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.083
If you try to play with it,

41:32.167 --> 41:34.417
you will be doomed.

41:37.208 --> 41:39.458
Can you really get rid of people's worries?

41:42.208 --> 41:43.249
You don't believe me?

41:43.333 --> 41:44.749
Try it.

41:46.958 --> 41:47.958
Let me try it.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Untie him.

41:51.083 --> 41:51.999
Don't ever try to fool around.

41:52.083 --> 41:52.958
If anything bad happens to me,

41:53.042 --> 41:54.292
they will deal with you,

41:54.375 --> 41:55.250
especially master wan.

41:55.333 --> 41:56.958
He's defeated all his challengers.

41:57.042 --> 41:57.875
People call him

41:57.958 --> 41:58.958
“the magic knuckle king.”

41:59.000 --> 41:59.625
moron!

41:59.708 --> 42:00.708
Liar!

42:01.958 --> 42:03.541
What are you guys talking about?

42:03.625 --> 42:04.625
Nothing.

42:05.333 --> 42:06.499
Tell me now.

42:06.583 --> 42:08.958
What are you trying to forget?

42:09.917 --> 42:11.559
Last night I ate a rat's tail by accident.

42:11.583 --> 42:12.999
I've been feeling nauseated.

42:13.083 --> 42:14.833
I don't want to remember it any more.

42:19.417 --> 42:20.292
Who cooked this?

42:20.375 --> 42:21.791
I did.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.625
There's a rat's tail in the dish!

42:23.708 --> 42:26.583
Chief, rats live on human food, too.

42:26.667 --> 42:28.375
They are clean. Don't worry.

42:32.292 --> 42:33.167
Who cooked this?

42:33.250 --> 42:34.666
I did.

42:34.750 --> 42:36.500
There's a "beep" in the dish!

42:36.583 --> 42:39.458
Chief, "beep" live on human food, too.

42:39.542 --> 42:41.250
They are clean. Don't worry.

42:46.125 --> 42:47.208
Chief,

42:47.292 --> 42:50.583
do you still remember

42:50.667 --> 42:53.000
you ate a rat's tail?

42:53.083 --> 42:54.666
What rat's tail?

42:55.333 --> 42:56.624
You ate a rat's tail last night.

42:56.708 --> 42:57.958
Do you still feel nauseated?

42:58.958 --> 43:00.416
No way.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.583
The lay monk really got
rid of your worries.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.500
Really?

43:06.208 --> 43:08.291
He's really good at what he does!

43:08.375 --> 43:10.015
You can help people forget their worries,

43:10.083 --> 43:12.791
but can you make people listen to you?

43:12.875 --> 43:14.250
Of course.

43:14.333 --> 43:15.893
Once people have their worries removed,

43:15.958 --> 43:17.749
they are like a blank sheet of paper.

43:17.833 --> 43:18.916
Whatever you tell them,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.291
they will believe.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.500
I want everyone in the
village to listen to me.

43:25.583 --> 43:26.416
Can that be done?

43:26.500 --> 43:27.541
Give me back my clothes.

43:27.625 --> 43:28.708
Let me stay at the temple,

43:28.792 --> 43:30.375
and prepare two copper coins for me.

43:30.458 --> 43:31.791
Tell everyone in the village,

43:31.875 --> 43:33.583
whoever comes to have
their worries removed

43:33.667 --> 43:35.708
will receive two copper coins for free.

43:36.083 --> 43:39.458
When everything's over
you'll get your coins back.

43:41.708 --> 43:43.666
If you dare to lie to me, you are doomed.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.875
I'll beat you up to be a dead monk.

43:47.708 --> 43:48.708
Ok. Line up properly.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.125
Or no money for you.

43:54.083 --> 43:55.083
Doggie egg,

43:55.125 --> 43:56.750
what are you lining up for?

43:56.833 --> 43:58.999
To get rid of worries and make some money.

43:59.958 --> 44:01.874
What worries do you have?

44:01.958 --> 44:03.416
I can think of some easily.

44:04.333 --> 44:05.708
After it's done,

44:05.792 --> 44:08.167
these two coins will be yours.

44:08.250 --> 44:09.166
Now tell me.

44:09.250 --> 44:11.375
What worries do you have?

44:11.458 --> 44:12.749
I don't have worries.

44:13.375 --> 44:14.750
What are they lining outside for?

44:15.917 --> 44:16.792
Weren't you there earlier?

44:16.875 --> 44:18.375
It was you who were there.

44:18.458 --> 44:19.374
Was I?

44:19.458 --> 44:21.624
Having no worries is a kind of worry, too.

44:22.542 --> 44:23.750
How did it go, doggie egg?

44:23.833 --> 44:24.833
It's wonderful to forget.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.041
Next!

44:30.917 --> 44:32.417
My ♪1 treasure box!

44:32.500 --> 44:33.768
You stole it from me, didn't you?

44:33.792 --> 44:34.708
Are you out of your mind?

44:34.792 --> 44:38.083
It was you who went to see that lay monk.

44:38.750 --> 44:39.833
And then what?

44:39.917 --> 44:41.809
And then you came back
and took the treasure box.

44:41.833 --> 44:43.541
You said you were going to see him again.

44:44.208 --> 44:44.999
Come with me!

44:45.083 --> 44:45.791
Come with me!

44:45.875 --> 44:46.875
Come with me!

44:47.375 --> 44:48.458
Move forward!

44:48.542 --> 44:49.292
Move forward!

44:49.375 --> 44:50.375
Move forward!

44:53.042 --> 44:53.917
Open the door!

44:54.000 --> 44:54.541
Open the door!

44:54.625 --> 44:56.625
Give me back my treasure box.

44:56.708 --> 44:57.916
What treasure?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.166
Spring said I brought
my treasure box to see you.

45:00.250 --> 45:01.791
You never came to see me.

45:01.875 --> 45:04.000
Let me take a look at your memory.

45:04.083 --> 45:04.916
Go home now, children.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Go.

45:07.625 --> 45:08.750
Tie him up quickly.

45:08.833 --> 45:10.583
I can also help you locate

45:10.667 --> 45:13.917
all the money that you forgot you had.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.166
Really?

45:15.667 --> 45:16.809
Then hurry up and open the door.

45:16.833 --> 45:17.916
Help me find more money.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.750
Come on.
You're not supposed to "pull" the door.

45:20.833 --> 45:22.458
You're supposed to "push" it.

45:27.958 --> 45:29.291
How could I have forgotten?

45:34.542 --> 45:36.417
Autumn.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.500
Autumn.

45:37.833 --> 45:38.458
That lay monk

45:38.542 --> 45:39.792
is wicked.

45:39.875 --> 45:40.666
You know what?

45:40.750 --> 45:43.458
All the villagers now are obedient to
chief's every command.

45:43.542 --> 45:45.500
For sure he is going to
lead them to a revolt.

45:45.583 --> 45:46.943
I think we'd better hurry and run.

45:47.583 --> 45:49.666
I thought you were an invincible
kung fu master.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.625
How can you be afraid of a couple bandits?

45:51.708 --> 45:53.166
Unless you are a liar.

45:57.917 --> 45:59.792
Lam not a liar.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.916
I was a timid child when I was little.

46:03.000 --> 46:03.583
People bullied me.

46:03.667 --> 46:04.976
That's why I took up martial arts.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.666
I got better at kung fu,

46:06.750 --> 46:08.708
but I am still very fearful.

46:08.792 --> 46:12.000
All my life I've never
really fought anyone.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.708
To fight well, you'll need energy.

46:13.792 --> 46:15.750
For some reason, I just
can't muster up any.

46:15.833 --> 46:17.559
Then what about your alias,
"the magic knuckle king."

46:17.583 --> 46:19.499
How did you get it?

46:20.042 --> 46:21.500
That alias...

46:23.250 --> 46:24.041
Once it travels outside the village,

46:24.125 --> 46:25.666
no one will recognize it.

46:31.208 --> 46:32.208
Master wan,

46:32.292 --> 46:33.625
you are a good guy.

46:33.708 --> 46:34.708
Hurry up and leave now.

46:36.125 --> 46:37.208
You are really not leaving?

46:41.958 --> 46:42.958
Ok.

46:43.958 --> 46:45.768
I'll go to the city
and report everything to the court.

46:45.792 --> 46:47.192
Then I'll come back and rescue you.

46:52.667 --> 46:53.958
Take care of yourself.

46:54.042 --> 46:55.792
I'll be back soon.

47:03.958 --> 47:05.541
Should I bring an umbrella?

47:39.708 --> 47:40.708
Come with me.

47:42.250 --> 47:42.750
You fool.

47:42.833 --> 47:43.458
What are you looking at?

47:43.542 --> 47:44.542
Scram!

47:47.708 --> 47:49.333
Where is master wan?

47:49.417 --> 47:51.333
Let me tell you. I'm sparing your life.

47:51.417 --> 47:52.809
Take little pie and get away from here.

47:52.833 --> 47:53.916
I want this house.

47:54.000 --> 47:54.791
Hurry! Hurry!

47:54.875 --> 47:55.625
Take everything.

47:55.708 --> 47:56.499
What are you doing?

47:56.583 --> 47:57.166
You fool,

47:57.250 --> 47:58.250
you are still looking.

47:59.208 --> 48:00.583
What are you doing? Tie her up.

48:00.917 --> 48:02.125
Tie her up quickly.

48:02.208 --> 48:03.518
You are asking for death, you stupid girl.

48:03.542 --> 48:04.809
When I come back, I'll burn you alive.

48:04.833 --> 48:05.708
Let go of me.

48:05.792 --> 48:07.042
Wait...

48:07.667 --> 48:09.417
Autumn, why don't you just marry me?

48:10.458 --> 48:12.124
Good thing big pie's dead.

48:12.917 --> 48:15.292
It's nice now that Autumn is a widow.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.375
However, what good does it do me?

48:17.458 --> 48:18.708
Spring is gone,

48:18.792 --> 48:20.958
and Autumn still hates me.

48:21.042 --> 48:22.875
What in the world am I doing?

48:22.958 --> 48:24.333
Come, let's drink.

48:30.208 --> 48:31.518
How come you are not drinking, Mr. tien?

48:31.542 --> 48:33.667
Lam not here to drink.

48:33.750 --> 48:35.625
The wine that your village produces

48:35.708 --> 48:38.291
is not for everybody.

48:38.375 --> 48:39.541
Then what are you doing here?

48:39.625 --> 48:40.791
To help you.

48:40.875 --> 48:42.666
You know way too much.

48:45.042 --> 48:46.125
This wine...

48:49.125 --> 48:49.916
Is not for everybody.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Right.

50:53.417 --> 50:54.667
What is your name?

50:56.708 --> 50:57.499
He doesn't remember.

50:57.583 --> 50:59.458
He's forgotten everything.

50:59.542 --> 51:00.792
Look at him.

51:02.125 --> 51:04.125
Chief, it's your turn.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.249
What do you mean "my turn"?

51:06.333 --> 51:08.249
You think I am that dumb?

51:08.333 --> 51:11.166
You are not dumb, just a little gullible.

51:11.250 --> 51:12.041
Gullible? Me?

51:12.125 --> 51:13.125
Grab him!

51:13.458 --> 51:14.458
Oh!

51:15.000 --> 51:15.541
Let go of me.

51:15.625 --> 51:16.625
Let go of me.

52:28.667 --> 52:29.667
Autumn.

52:34.292 --> 52:35.917
Little pie, where's Autumn?

52:54.292 --> 52:55.375
Autumn!

52:55.458 --> 52:56.938
Who tied you up and put you up there?

53:13.583 --> 53:16.083
Little pie is a retard.

53:16.167 --> 53:18.167
No need to worry too much about him.

53:18.250 --> 53:21.375
You are the only one
that remembers everything.

53:21.458 --> 53:23.583
You are lonely and all by yourself.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.875
All the things in the past,

53:27.958 --> 53:29.041
just forget about them.

53:29.708 --> 53:30.791
Forget about them?

53:33.083 --> 53:34.958
What will happen if I do?

53:35.042 --> 53:36.083
If you forget.

53:36.167 --> 53:38.042
You can start a new life.

53:41.292 --> 53:42.000
But Dean...

53:42.083 --> 53:43.374
Shush.

53:45.208 --> 53:47.083
You are thinking...

53:47.167 --> 53:48.958
Way too much.

54:05.458 --> 54:07.583
<i>Every morning before I wake up,</i>

54:07.667 --> 54:10.292
<i>I seem to have this dream.</i>

54:10.375 --> 54:11.750
<i>But whatever was in my dream,</i>

54:11.833 --> 54:13.166
<i>I could hardly remember.</i>

54:13.708 --> 54:17.666
<i>I just feel like I am the luckiest woman
in the world.</i>

54:20.042 --> 54:22.583
<i>Because my husband
fortune tien spoiled me like crazy.</i>

54:22.667 --> 54:24.958
<i>Everybody loves him.</i>

54:31.542 --> 54:33.792
Who am I?

54:33.875 --> 54:35.708
<i>My husband, fortune 'hen.</i>

54:53.667 --> 54:57.167
<i>People come and ask him
for help every morning.</i>

55:01.792 --> 55:04.250
Good morning, chief!

55:04.333 --> 55:06.249
Good morning, everyone!

55:06.792 --> 55:09.208
<i>He has this beautiful box.</i>

55:09.292 --> 55:11.500
<i>Inside lies this precious instrument.</i>

55:13.417 --> 55:15.000
<i>He calls it</i>

55:15.083 --> 55:16.749
<i>"the worry ridder."</i>

55:20.875 --> 55:23.333
<i>It gets rid of the villagers' worries.</i>

55:23.417 --> 55:25.167
<i>People are therefore worry-free.</i>

55:26.000 --> 55:28.541
<i>Their main task is to dig for treasures.</i>

55:29.625 --> 55:32.333
<i>My husband says
our village has good feng shui.</i>

55:32.417 --> 55:33.333
<i>If we find the treasures,</i>

55:33.417 --> 55:35.833
<i>all our lives will be
changed for the better.</i>

55:39.583 --> 55:42.249
<i>But for some reason
people have poor memories.</i>

55:42.333 --> 55:44.458
<i>They often forget the little things.</i>

55:45.417 --> 55:46.750
Why are you sleeping in my house?

55:46.833 --> 55:48.333
This is my house.

55:48.417 --> 55:49.667
Then who's the one behind you?

55:51.917 --> 55:53.143
Why are you sleeping in my house?

55:53.167 --> 55:53.958
This is my house.

55:54.042 --> 55:55.583
Then who's the one behind you?

55:57.083 --> 55:59.458
<i>Sometimes men even forget
their own names.</i>

55:59.542 --> 56:00.417
Good morning, Mr. b and Mr. c.

56:00.500 --> 56:03.333
<i>So their names are written
on their foreheads.</i>

56:06.625 --> 56:08.791
What happened to the names
on your foreheads?

56:10.083 --> 56:11.374
Your name is missing, too.

56:11.458 --> 56:12.208
What was the name
written on your forehead?

56:12.292 --> 56:13.083
It was "Mr. c."

56:13.167 --> 56:13.917
No, I am Mr. c.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Lam Mr. c.

56:15.083 --> 56:16.083
You are Mr. a.

56:16.167 --> 56:17.167
Am I?

56:18.500 --> 56:19.291
Mr. a, Mr. b, and Mr. c,

56:19.375 --> 56:21.083
from now on don't wash your faces.

56:21.167 --> 56:22.375
Ok.

56:23.375 --> 56:24.855
Do you want me to blow dry your face?

56:24.917 --> 56:25.708
Sure.

56:25.792 --> 56:27.167
Can you do that for me, too?

56:29.875 --> 56:30.500
It feels good.

56:30.583 --> 56:33.708
<i>As for women,
a petal is drawn on each of their faces.</i>

56:33.792 --> 56:35.167
<i>I am first flower.</i>

56:35.250 --> 56:36.291
<i>This is third flower.</i>

56:36.375 --> 56:37.708
Good morning, ma'am!

56:37.792 --> 56:40.542
Good morning, chief!

56:42.500 --> 56:45.541
<i>What would we do without fortune tien?</i>

56:45.625 --> 56:47.750
<i>"Spring morning arrived unnoticed,"</i>

56:47.833 --> 56:49.916
<i>"because we were all sleeping like a baby."</i>

56:50.000 --> 56:52.041
<i>"A noisy storm raged through the night,"</i>

56:52.125 --> 56:54.250
<i>"but none of us were worried."</i>

56:54.333 --> 56:56.499
<i>"In the winter thick blankets
keep us warm."</i>

56:56.583 --> 56:58.666
<i>"Throughout the year
fortune tien keeps us safe."</i>

56:58.750 --> 57:00.875
<i>Clink-clank, clink-clank,
clink-clank, clink!</i>

57:00.958 --> 57:04.624
<i>What would we do without fortune tien?</i>

57:04.708 --> 57:07.958
It's another new day.

57:08.042 --> 57:12.542
All the misfortunes we experienced
in the past,

57:12.667 --> 57:16.625
we've tried our best to forget.

57:16.708 --> 57:19.708
From now on make sure
you remember only one thing,

57:19.792 --> 57:21.125
which is,

57:21.208 --> 57:22.749
to keep digging for treasures.

57:22.833 --> 57:25.083
Digging for treasures.

57:25.167 --> 57:26.875
Make sure you remember

57:26.958 --> 57:31.374
to tell me your worries if you have any.

57:31.458 --> 57:34.374
Because I can help you

57:34.458 --> 57:36.708
get rid of the worries.

57:36.792 --> 57:39.750
Get rid of the worries.

57:39.833 --> 57:40.958
Now that you've been fed,

57:41.042 --> 57:42.708
go back to work.

57:42.792 --> 57:45.708
<i>Even though life appears peaceful,</i>

57:45.792 --> 57:49.542
<i>I often feel a disconnect.</i>

57:49.625 --> 57:50.541
<i>My husband says,</i>

57:50.625 --> 57:53.000
<i>"if you can't remember it,
it means it's not important."</i>

57:53.083 --> 57:55.916
<i>But I am really curious about</i>

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
<i>what I've forgotten.</i>

57:59.083 --> 58:00.916
A dead body!

58:01.000 --> 58:03.250
Chief! A dead body!

58:03.333 --> 58:04.708
Whose body is this?

58:04.792 --> 58:06.917
Did this person live in our village?

58:09.208 --> 58:11.083
You seem to have all forgotten.

58:12.333 --> 58:13.583
This is the body of

58:14.167 --> 58:16.083
a cold-blooded bandit,

58:16.167 --> 58:20.667
whose name stirred
widespread fear and paranoia.

58:20.833 --> 58:24.374
He was dark cloud of the cloud clan.

58:24.458 --> 58:25.666
Dark cloud?

58:25.750 --> 58:27.833
No wonder his face looks so dark.

58:27.917 --> 58:31.792
The last time they launched an all-out war,

58:31.875 --> 58:33.916
they wiped out our village.

58:35.458 --> 58:36.458
Mr. a.

58:39.750 --> 58:40.750
Mr. c.

58:42.083 --> 58:46.583
The bandits killed your wives, too.

58:48.292 --> 58:50.208
So I had a wife.

58:51.125 --> 58:53.166
I can't even remember
what my wife looked like.

58:53.250 --> 58:56.833
You were in so much pain.

58:56.917 --> 58:59.667
You asked me to help you forget it all.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.000
Did I have a wife?

59:03.083 --> 59:03.833
No, you didn't.

59:03.917 --> 59:04.917
Why not?

59:05.000 --> 59:07.041
How would I know?

59:13.583 --> 59:15.708
Not only did you not have a wife,

59:17.667 --> 59:18.667
Mr. b,

59:19.542 --> 59:22.208
but your parents

59:22.292 --> 59:25.167
were also killed by the bandits.

59:26.083 --> 59:27.083
Really?!

59:27.917 --> 59:29.833
Mom! Dad!

59:31.792 --> 59:32.833
First flower,

59:35.583 --> 59:37.333
you were seriously injured, too.

59:38.917 --> 59:39.917
Mr. d,

59:42.208 --> 59:43.916
you had

59:44.000 --> 59:45.458
an older brother,

59:46.208 --> 59:49.499
but the bandits killed him as well.

59:49.583 --> 59:51.666
Big bro...

59:51.750 --> 59:56.250
That day, our village
lost more than 20 lives.

59:56.792 --> 59:59.208
I happened to pass by the village,

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.166
and I saved you.

01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:06.374
Our chief fortune tien is a big hero!

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.374
Big hero!

01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:09.083
Chief,

01:00:09.167 --> 01:00:10.184
you perform righteous acts,

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.048
and your kung fu skills
are the best, bar none.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:14.458
<i>What would we do without fortune tien?</i>

01:00:14.542 --> 01:00:15.458
<i>What would we do?</i>

01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:17.500
Chief, I didn't know
you are a kung fu master.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:18.624
What is your alias?

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:23.374
My alias is...

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:24.374
Tell us.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:25.874
Tell us.

01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.791
My alias is...

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.250
"The magic knuckle...

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:30.999
King."

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.208
Big bro...

01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:37.333
Big bro, wake up!

01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:39.500
Why did he call him "big bro"?

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:40.916
He's a retard.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.750
He's always acted crazy, right?

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:44.913
Hurry up and carry him out.

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:46.708
Carry him out

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.250
and bury him.

01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:53.333
We can never allow
dark cloud to come back to life.

01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:16.042
Make way.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:18.792
Make way.

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:21.999
Don't you know?

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.874
I am rainbow slicer.

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.268
I only yield to seniors and children.

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:26.833
If you don't make way for me,

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:28.667
I will slice you up.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.583
Your brain will explode.

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:30.667
Body in blood.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:31.666
Your stomach will burst open.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:32.250
Your bones will break.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:32.833
No descendants to your name.

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:33.917
And you can never be

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:36.958
reincarnated.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.000
Big sis!

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:19.499
Why did it take you so long?

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:20.458
I had to deliver mail.

01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:21.750
What is this?

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:22.999
Iron horse.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.416
Does it eat grass?

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.000
No.

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:26.916
I've never carried any horse in my life.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.333
Let me ride it later.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:30.708
Kiddo,

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:34.541
go home and find big pie ch...

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.625
See if he's taken care of the business.

01:02:36.708 --> 01:02:37.749
If he hasn't,

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:38.993
then take care of it for him.

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:40.958
Understood.

01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:42.708
Take this messenger pigeon with you.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.208
Release him when you are done.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:47.483
Then meet us at rolling-horse hill.

01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:48.542
Understood.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.791
Kiddo,

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.375
I gave her your letter.

01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:54.917
A gorgeous girl.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.083
Are you ill?

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.041
Isn't anyone taking care of you?

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.541
Later on let me fix you something to eat.

01:04:17.875 --> 01:04:19.000
<i>"Dear Dean,"</i>

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:20.958
<i>the windy season is here again.</i>

01:04:21.042 --> 01:04:22.792
<i>All the flowers and blades of grass</i>

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.250
<i>are calling out your name.</i>

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:28.708
<i>The rooster has been counting the days
since you went away.</i>

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:31.042
<i>The butterflies are recounting
everything about you.</i>

01:04:31.542 --> 01:04:32.792
<i>You said, 'ducks don't fly</i>

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:35.000
<i>because they are yearning for someone.'</i>

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.333
<i>I wish I were a bird,</i>

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:39.333
<i>so I could fly to you this instant.</i>

01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:43.458
<i>I often think about the shangri-la
you talked about.</i>

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.958
<i>How I wish you and I could live in that</i>

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:47.042
<i>worry-free,</i>

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.041
<i>timeless place!</i>

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:52.708
<i>"But does shangri-la really exist?"</i>

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:57.403
<i>"The winds have stopped blowing."</i>

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.058
<i>All the flowers and blades of grass have</i>

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.499
<i>also stopped calling out your name.</i>

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.308
<i>I've been waiting for you for two years.</i>

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.375
<i>"I feel like a dry, dirty dish towel."</i>

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.499
<i>"Dear Dean,"</i>

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:11.541
<i>today your father asked me
to marry big pie chu.</i>

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:13.791
<i>He told me to stop dreaming.</i>

01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:16.333
<i>You are going to be
a prestigious government official someday.</i>

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:19.042
<i>And I am just a woman
who brings bad luck.</i>

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:21.958
<i>A duck is no match for a dragon.</i>

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:25.792
<i>Ducks may not fly,</i>

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:28.333
<i>but they can walk.</i>

01:05:28.417 --> 01:05:29.875
<i>As for me, I want to run.</i>

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:31.458
<i>I want to run to you.</i>

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:34.958
<i>"But do you still remember me?"</i>

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.375
Hey, everyone!

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:48.458
Time to eat!

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:50.875
Wonderful! We are having buns today.

01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:52.958
Buns!

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:54.458
- Buns!
- What are you doing?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.583
Grab him.

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.208
Go, go grab him.

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:01.559
I tried to remove his
worries a couple times.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:02.583
So much trouble.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Grab him.

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:10.041
Grab him.

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:12.416
Go, go grab him.

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:15.333
Beat it!

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:19.000
Be careful! Careful!

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:20.874
Too dangerous.

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:23.583
Be careful!

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:24.667
Too dangerous...

01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:25.499
My precious instrument!

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.624
Too dangerous...

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:28.542
Don't hit my...

01:06:30.292 --> 01:06:31.542
Precious instrument!

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.458
Oh my!

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:38.542
Bury him!

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.458
Are you sure?

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:41.667
Am I sure?!

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.000
Shove that into his mouth!

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500
How dare you!

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:55.667
Does the law not apply here any more?

01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:01.166
You... Who are you?

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:05.291
Uncle golden Lin.

01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:07.667
You don't recognize me.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:08.916
Me?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.583
Lam not your uncle Lin.

01:07:10.667 --> 01:07:11.833
Lam Mr. a.

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:13.375
Who's Mr. a?

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:16.375
Master wan.

01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:17.791
Me? I am not master wan.

01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:18.875
Lam Mr. b.

01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:19.917
And I am Mr. c.

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:21.750
Are you all joking?

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:23.625
Is there a Mr. d then?

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:26.791
Mr. d is here.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.208
Stop goofing around.

01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:31.000
Where's my dad?

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:32.166
Who's your dad?

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.500
The village chief!

01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:36.500
Hi, chief!

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:39.458
Hi, chief!

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:41.998
You are the village chief?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:44.375
Yes, I am.

01:07:44.417 --> 01:07:46.393
If you are the village chief,
then what about my dad?

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:48.167
Lam number 2.

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:51.791
Dad!

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:53.041
Dad!

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:53.875
He's a bandit.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:54.833
Arrest him.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:56.583
Hurry, grab him.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.333
Grab him.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.875
Grab him.

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:01.666
Take him away.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.208
Hurry! Take him away.

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:11.624
Autumn!

01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:13.208
Release the pigeon!

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:14.333
Who's that?

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:16.457
Why does he keep calling me "Autumn"?

01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:17.625
He's a bandit.

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:18.332
Don't be afraid.

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:19.417
Go home now.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.000
Let me go take a look.

01:08:41.832 --> 01:08:43.457
Dad.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:45.167
Lam an awful son.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.350
I was too ashamed to come back to see you.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:53.541
Ashamed...

01:08:58.207 --> 01:08:59.749
Three years ago,

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:01.832
you wanted me to go exam
for public officials.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.375
Guess what happened?

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:09.750
When I was halfway to the city,
the revolution happened.

01:09:12.792 --> 01:09:15.352
- And the great ching dynasty was gone.
- Gone... Gone... Gone...

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:18.167
Then I ran into
a bunch of defeated ching soldiers.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.250
They robbed me blind.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:24.541
I almost lost my life.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.625
Fortunately, the cloud clan saved me.

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:35.124
I am riding on the somersault clouds.

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:43.582
Now the village is about to be wiped out,

01:09:43.667 --> 01:09:45.207
I need to get you out of here, dad!

01:09:45.292 --> 01:09:46.625
Out of here... Out of here...

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:48.291
Dad!

01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:49.250
What happened?

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:51.499
Why have you become like this?

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:53.791
"Baaaaa."

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:57.041
"Baaaaa."

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:01.333
You two are too noisy.

01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:09.667
Where's Autumn?

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.125
I want to see her.

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.750
You and Autumn.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.416
What's your relationship with her?

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.291
She's my wife.

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:23.333
Autumn is your wife?

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:24.917
She's my wife.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.541
Lam her husband.

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:27.833
That's impossible!

01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:28.750
She promised she would wait for me.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.193
It's impossible she would marry...

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:34.541
The worry ridder.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:44.125
Whose wife is Autumn now?

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.042
Mine!

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:48.583
Mine!

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:49.167
Mine!

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.750
Mine!

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:50.333
Mine!

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.041
Mine!

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.375
Mine!

01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:06.375
Have some tea, chief.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.958
Do you have worries, chief?

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:15.875
Let me get rid of them for you.

01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.208
Don't touch it!

01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:18.583
See!

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.666
<i>"Welcome to the worry ridder."</i>

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.541
<i>What you are doing now</i>

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.583
<i>involves danger.</i>

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:21.875
<i>Please think twice before proceeding.</i>

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:24.208
<i>To view your life, click 'life.'</i>

01:12:24.292 --> 01:12:26.708
<i>to remove your worries, click 'delete.'</i>

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:29.125
<i>to restore your soul,
wait for further instructions.</i>

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:32.958
<i>You are about to enter the viewing mode.</i>

01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:34.708
<i>Use your right hand to turn the handle.</i>

01:12:34.792 --> 01:12:36.512
<i>"Use your left hand to choose your option."</i>

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.500
Quit it.

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:41.417
I want you, spring.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500
Quit it.

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:43.458
I want you, spring.

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:44.622
Stop! Don't get any closer.

01:12:56.792 --> 01:12:58.708
Why are you staring at me like that?

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.625
You are so pretty.

01:13:01.917 --> 01:13:03.417
Stop that nonsense.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.750
Third flower,

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:07.749
was your old name "spring"?

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:10.015
I've always used the name "third flower."

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:14.625
Do you like Mr. c?

01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:15.708
Mr. c?

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.292
No.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:18.916
He looks like a monkey to me.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.749
Can you write a couple of words
for me later?

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:23.208
I can't read.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:24.417
How's that even possible?

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:30.333
The lingering dreams
from the past are hard to forget.

01:13:30.417 --> 01:13:34.542
Souls are restored
where the four baboons gather.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.666
<i>Four baboons...</i>

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:39.583
<i>Four baboons...</i>

01:13:44.708 --> 01:13:47.624
Are we eating the same things
we ate yesterday?

01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:48.833
Yes.

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:50.000
Just like yesterday.

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:56.958
We are eating the same things
we ate yesterday.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.708
<i>Four baboons...</i>

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:10.333
That's right.
We had the same food yesterday.

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.542
You can remember things just by
knocking on your head?

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.750
<i>Four baboons...</i>

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.458
It really works.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.042
Why don't you give it a try.

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:29.000
<i>Four baboons...</i>

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.375
Stop right there!

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.916
Take a step back.

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:41.708
Stop!

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:45.250
Take a small step forward.

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:48.416
A little bit more...

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.375
Stop!

01:14:51.708 --> 01:14:53.124
Eureka! I found it!

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.833
I am the fourth baboon.

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:00.208
It's right here.

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:01.792
Start digging, you all.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.166
Right here.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.250
You move forward.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.083
What's wrong with you?

01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:07.167
Move forward.

01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:08.708
I need a couple of people here.

01:15:08.792 --> 01:15:10.875
Keep digging-

01:15:10.958 --> 01:15:13.249
hurry. Hurry up.

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:19.625
I hear...

01:15:19.708 --> 01:15:21.708
I hear everywhere chirping...

01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:22.976
I hear everywhere chipping birds...

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.375
I hear...

01:15:25.458 --> 01:15:26.666
I hear everywhere...

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.333
I hear everywhere chirping...

01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:29.476
I hear everywhere chipping birds...

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.333
I hear...

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:32.958
I hear everywhere chipping...

01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:34.101
I hear everywhere chipping birds...

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:36.916
I hear everywhere...

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.666
I hear everywhere chipping birds...

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.416
You shameless, evil-looking...

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.583
Shame on you!

01:15:57.917 --> 01:15:59.958
<i>My name 'vs fortune 'hen.</i>

01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:01.833
Chief!

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.833
What are you doing, uncle Lin?

01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:08.077
Your pigs were born from
the sperms of the male pigs...

01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:11.125
Me?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.208
Mr. d

01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:14.750
hurry up and dig!

01:16:14.833 --> 01:16:16.458
I am dying, chief!

01:16:16.542 --> 01:16:17.792
Save me!

01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:19.958
An arrow in your arm won't kill you.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.583
You are a big hero, chief!

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:25.208
Save me!

01:16:25.292 --> 01:16:26.875
Save him!

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:29.375
Look at the lovey-dovey couple.

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:30.874
Lovey-dovey my ass!

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:31.499
That's right.

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:33.833
Chief will never allow
his son to marry Autumn.

01:16:33.917 --> 01:16:34.917
You are right.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:41.374
Aren't they bandits?

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.417
Stop groaning!

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:51.917
Didn't I say I would help you?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.400
So then why are you still groaning?

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:55.833
What are you doing?

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:58.999
Is this a good position for it?

01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:00.917
No...

01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.333
Remove it now.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.166
Yes, chief.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.083
Oh, by the way,

01:17:04.167 --> 01:17:05.958
write a new name tag for Mr. d.

01:17:06.542 --> 01:17:07.292
Ok.

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:08.615
I can't guarantee it will work.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:09.583
I don't care. Just do it!

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.667
Hurry up, please.

01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:15.000
What are you doing?

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:18.166
Girls, go mountain-climbing.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.541
Go mountain-climbing.

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:28.458
Mr. d,

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.083
is anything bothering you?

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:32.292
No.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.833
Your arm doesn't hurt any more,

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:36.125
does it?

01:17:36.208 --> 01:17:38.208
Not any more.

01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:40.458
Why am I shot again?

01:17:40.542 --> 01:17:41.684
Who shot an arrow into my arm again?

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:43.208
You are healed.

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:45.542
Mr. d,

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:47.042
did you know from

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.916
before the bandit we arrested?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.250
No, I don't.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.624
Who shot me with an arrow?

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.374
Who shot me?

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.708
Where are you going?

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:40.958
So you are a member of the cloud clan.

01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:50.999
Our village is going to be raided...

01:18:55.625 --> 01:18:57.083
What are you doing here?

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.666
To feed the sheep.

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.125
Go home as soon as you are done.

01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.208
Yes.

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:35.542
A bird!

01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:36.917
Allow me!

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.541
Actualize.

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.333
Big sis, there's a cloth strip.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:58.167
"Go-ii"

01:19:59.167 --> 01:20:00.250
it's from kiddo.

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:03.208
Bastard.

01:20:03.958 --> 01:20:05.416
Who told you to shoot the pigeon?

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.458
I was going to grill it...

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:10.042
My fellow villagers,

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:12.416
I just got
wind of some important information.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.291
The bandits are going to raid
our village again.

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:17.416
We need to come up with a plan

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.541
and defeat them together.

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:20.208
In our village,

01:20:20.292 --> 01:20:23.042
we've dug quite a few holes.

01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:24.245
Let's place inside each hole

01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:25.958
some wooden nails,

01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:27.417
and cover them with hay.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.976
Once the bandits fall into the holes,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.875
they will be impaled and die.

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:32.791
Wonderful!

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:35.374
Let's divide into groups.

01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:36.124
Mr. c,

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:37.416
take a man with you

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.541
and some barrels of corn starch and rocks.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:41.416
Then go and hide behind the temple.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.416
When you see the bandits,

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.851
spread the corn starch all over them,

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:47.250
and then stone them to
death with the rocks.

01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:49.458
Great!

01:20:49.542 --> 01:20:50.333
Chief,

01:20:50.417 --> 01:20:52.042
why corn starch?

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:55.249
We have nothing
but corn starch in our village.

01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:58.708
When the bandits come,
just throw it towards their faces.

01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:01.553
Then they won't be able to open their eyes.

01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:03.541
Chief, I prefer hiding on the roof.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.833
Put away your teeth.

01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:07.708
My fellow villagers,

01:21:07.792 --> 01:21:09.917
as long as we are positioned properly,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.500
we will be able to wipe out all the
bandits... From top to bottom.

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:17.875
How wise, chief!

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.041
How come kiddo is not back yet?

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:24.166
Let's wait for the night to fall,

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:25.666
whether he's back or not.

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:55.874
For the future of the village,

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.249
let's give it one more push.

01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:03.791
All of you, follow me!

01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:04.875
Follow me!

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:06.833
Let's go dig for treasure.

01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:08.000
Lam not hungry

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:08.583
or tired any more.

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:10.833
Next!

01:22:25.917 --> 01:22:26.917
What's wrong?

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:29.541
Lam not sure.

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:31.041
Once I am in there,

01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:32.791
my worries will be gone.

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:35.916
Hmm, no more worries.

01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:37.916
Then“.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.541
Will you still smile at me
like this in the future?

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:45.542
I don't know.

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:01.333
Some of you should defend our village.

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:03.417
The rest of you, keep digging.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.291
Can't you be a little more careful?

01:23:07.375 --> 01:23:08.416
That's so wasteful!

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.083
Use your brain, won't you?

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:34.250
Here we are.

01:23:34.333 --> 01:23:36.083
Dad.

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:39.125
We ran into some bandits,
and my mom was abducted.

01:23:39.917 --> 01:23:40.917
Don't be afraid.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.458
I'll take care of you.

01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:44.874
Autumn, I'll go rescue your mother.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:46.249
Wait for my return.

01:23:46.333 --> 01:23:47.666
Ok?

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:49.750
Dad.

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.666
Don't forget about me.

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:13.083
What are you doing?

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:15.018
Your dad borrowed money from me
to save your mom.

01:24:15.042 --> 01:24:16.362
From now on, you are my property.

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:17.537
You'd better behave yourself.

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:19.851
Are you thinking of your dad?

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:21.458
He'll save your mom and bring her back.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.166
Don't worry.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:34.999
All right.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.666
Don't be sad.

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:37.791
I am leaving now.

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:39.625
Don't forget about me.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:40.916
One year at most.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:42.868
I'll come back and marry you.

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:44.916
Promise you'll come back to me.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.042
What are you doing?

01:24:54.708 --> 01:24:55.624
I...

01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:56.708
What did you see?

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:02.249
Whose cocoon is this?

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:03.333
Give it to me.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Chief,

01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:07.041
someone found a box.

01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:08.166
- Who did?
- I did.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:15.250
This box is too small.

01:25:15.292 --> 01:25:16.833
Probably not for holding treasures.

01:25:16.917 --> 01:25:18.208
You guys keep digging, ok?

01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:19.667
Then what is it?

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.208
It looks like a treasure box to me.

01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:22.750
I don't know.

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:25.083
I'll come get you once I get it to open.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:26.167
Come to think of it,

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.291
it may look like a treasure box now,

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:30.375
but once you open it,

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:33.083
it might shoot out
hundreds of poisonous arrows.

01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:35.250
Chief, I've never seen that many arrows.

01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:38.083
Won't you just shut up?

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:39.292
Ok.

01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:41.291
Go and keep digging. Hurry!

01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:42.375
Hurry up. Go.

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:43.667
Once I get the box to open,

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:44.958
I'll come get you.

01:25:45.042 --> 01:25:46.833
Hurry! Go and dig more!

01:25:48.292 --> 01:25:49.208
Where are you going?

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:50.292
I...

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:04.291
The soul restorer.

01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:05.541
It is true.

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:11.583
So this was what you were looking for.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.250
You weren't looking for treasures.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.125
Once your worries are removed,

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:16.874
only the soul restorer

01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:18.166
can bring back your memories.

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:20.542
How do you open this?

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:23.625
You got rid of all of our memories

01:26:23.708 --> 01:26:26.083
just so you could fool us into finding
this thing for you.

01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:28.208
You liar!

01:26:28.625 --> 01:26:30.041
Who are you calling a liar?

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.184
Before all the villagers could do
the whole day

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:34.124
was just eating, drinking,
peeing, pooing, and sleeping.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.999
What was there for you all to hang on to?

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.083
Hurry and pack up.

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.708
Pack up and leave with me.

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:39.934
Why do I have to leave with you?

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:41.268
Of course you're leaving with me.

01:26:41.292 --> 01:26:42.292
You are my wife!

01:26:42.333 --> 01:26:43.166
I am not!

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.083
You are!

01:26:44.167 --> 01:26:45.375
I am not!

01:26:46.708 --> 01:26:48.184
If the box contains poisonous arrows,

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.083
I mean hundreds of them,

01:26:49.167 --> 01:26:51.007
then each arrow should just be
about this size.

01:26:51.333 --> 01:26:52.791
Dean!

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:53.958
Dean!

01:26:54.708 --> 01:26:55.708
You stop right there.

01:26:55.792 --> 01:26:57.208
Why is she dragging him?

01:26:57.292 --> 01:26:58.958
Ma'am, why are you dragging me?

01:26:59.042 --> 01:27:00.500
Stop asking. Just run with me.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.874
Stop! Stop running!

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.833
Why is chief running after them?

01:27:04.917 --> 01:27:05.708
Should we run too?

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:06.417
Stop running!

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.666
Chief said to stop.

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.124
Stop running!

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:10.208
Run faster!

01:27:11.542 --> 01:27:12.917
Stop! Stop running!

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:15.000
Stop right there!

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:15.583
Hurry up!

01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:17.250
Why is chief chasing after us?

01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:19.833
We are playing a game with him.

01:27:19.917 --> 01:27:20.708
If he catches us,

01:27:20.792 --> 01:27:21.912
we will have no food to eat.

01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:23.166
Then we'd better hurry.

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:24.250
Run faster!

01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:28.000
Stop!

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:29.083
The train.

01:27:29.875 --> 01:27:30.750
Take us, train!

01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:31.916
The train.

01:27:32.417 --> 01:27:32.917
The train.

01:27:33.083 --> 01:27:34.083
Rescue us, train!

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:34.833
The train.

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:36.250
Bandits!

01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:37.416
Come back.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.875
They are bandits!

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:41.208
The bandits.

01:27:41.292 --> 01:27:41.958
Catch the bandits.

01:27:42.042 --> 01:27:43.882
If you get caught, you'll
have no food to eat.

01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:47.125
The bandits are here.

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:48.375
I got you.

01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:49.778
Why the hell are you grabbing me?

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:50.875
Let go of me.

01:27:50.958 --> 01:27:51.791
No more playing!

01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:52.955
No more playing! Let's run.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:55.291
The bandits are here.

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.500
We are stuck.

01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:03.833
We are stuck.

01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:05.208
Hack!

01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.208
Hack off the bridge?

01:28:07.292 --> 01:28:08.083
The bamboo branches.

01:28:08.167 --> 01:28:09.500
Chop off all the extra ones!

01:28:09.583 --> 01:28:10.851
Whose idea was it to
make this thing so big?

01:28:10.875 --> 01:28:11.375
Hack!

01:28:11.667 --> 01:28:12.167
Let go of me!

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:13.625
Let go of me!

01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:14.958
Let go of me!

01:28:15.042 --> 01:28:15.750
We are not playing any more.

01:28:15.833 --> 01:28:17.541
Not any more!

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:20.499
The bandits are here.

01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:22.083
Hurry up!

01:28:22.167 --> 01:28:22.833
The bandits are here.

01:28:22.917 --> 01:28:25.125
Move to your positions.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:26.041
The bandits are here.

01:28:26.125 --> 01:28:27.309
You are not supposed to be here.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:28.416
Where's your position?

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.167
I thought we'd stopped playing.

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:37.166
This is a new game. Hurry!

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.666
Mr. a,

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:40.666
you are supposed to be
at the village entrance.

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.791
Go now!

01:28:44.875 --> 01:28:46.041
Easy.

01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:47.500
First flower...

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:48.583
Oh!

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.291
You know I've been waiting for two years.

01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:54.375
I feel like a...

01:28:58.167 --> 01:28:59.708
Like a dry, dirty dish towel.

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.166
I am late.

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.083
You are not supposed to be here.

01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:04.750
Go away!

01:29:04.833 --> 01:29:05.833
<i>Wham'?</i>

01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:09.030
You are not supposed to be here.

01:30:05.917 --> 01:30:06.917
Man.

01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:31.083
You got shot!

01:30:31.167 --> 01:30:32.167
I got shot!

01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:33.208
Save me!

01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:34.833
You got shot again?!

01:31:12.417 --> 01:31:15.083
The rooster has been counting the days
since you went away.

01:31:15.167 --> 01:31:17.583
Move into your positions and kill them all!

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:19.042
From top to bottom!

01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:20.125
The butterflies...

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.333
You said, "ducks don't fly",

01:31:32.417 --> 01:31:34.750
because they are

01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:35.833
"yearning for someone."

01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:46.250
No pain and no itch,

01:31:46.333 --> 01:31:47.416
kill him!

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:17.833
Toss it at her!

01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:23.958
Careful, Mr. c!

01:32:30.417 --> 01:32:32.208
Lam dying...

01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:34.833
Mr. c!

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:35.750
Are you all right?

01:32:35.833 --> 01:32:36.749
You can't die yet.

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:38.499
If you die, then there'll be no Mr. c.

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:40.791
Mr. a can't die, either.

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.042
How are you doing, chief?

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:23.791
What are you doing up there?!

01:33:23.875 --> 01:33:24.875
Come down this minute!

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.250
Save me,

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:28.749
(M)' Big hero!

01:33:28.833 --> 01:33:29.499
Ok.

01:33:29.583 --> 01:33:30.624
I'll save you.

01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:31.749
Come“.

01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:35.499
But can I ask you to

01:33:35.583 --> 01:33:37.208
open this for me first?

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:40.166
Here you go.

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:49.583
"Turn back the worry ridder,

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:51.958
and the soul restorer will appear."

01:33:52.917 --> 01:33:53.958
Holy mother.

01:33:54.042 --> 01:33:55.083
Your mother wrote to you?

01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:57.167
Your mother wrote to you!

01:33:59.208 --> 01:34:00.416
Listen.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.000
You are the only one that can save us all.

01:34:03.083 --> 01:34:03.916
You are a great kung fu master.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:04.750
You know martial arts.

01:34:04.833 --> 01:34:07.208
You are the legendary "magic knuckle king."

01:34:07.292 --> 01:34:08.083
I am no kung fu master.

01:34:08.167 --> 01:34:08.708
You are the "magic knuckle king."

01:34:08.792 --> 01:34:09.542
No, you are.

01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:11.166
You are -you are.

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:11.791
Lam -I am.

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:13.000
Right, you are.

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:14.666
Ok, you listen to me.

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:15.333
You listen to me.

01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:16.726
Let me help you restore your power.

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.500
Let me help you restore your power.

01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:19.583
Come“.

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:22.166
I often think about the shangri-la
you talked about.

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:24.541
How I wish you and I could live in that

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.625
worry-free...

01:34:36.208 --> 01:34:37.208
Kiddo!

01:34:42.292 --> 01:34:43.500
This is the scholar's.

01:34:43.583 --> 01:34:44.208
I am really afraid.

01:34:44.292 --> 01:34:45.042
Don't be.

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:47.125
It'll be done in no time.

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:48.291
Let me find yours.

01:34:48.375 --> 01:34:49.375
You son of a bitch,

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:52.292
hiding in the pit with a girl!

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:53.855
- You son of a bitch!
- Let go of him!

01:34:54.208 --> 01:34:55.749
You son of a bitch. You betrayed us.

01:34:55.833 --> 01:34:57.333
You be...

01:35:01.292 --> 01:35:02.708
You betrayed us.

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:20.375
This is yours.

01:35:20.458 --> 01:35:22.124
"Turn back the worry ridder,

01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:23.666
and the soul restorer will appear."

01:35:38.792 --> 01:35:40.750
I've restored your memories.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:42.791
You are now

01:35:42.875 --> 01:35:44.166
"the magic knuckle king."

01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:44.750
You go.

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:46.291
Go and kill all the bandits.

01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:47.958
What bandits?

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:48.958
Bandits? I can't beat the bandits.

01:35:49.042 --> 01:35:49.833
Don't be afraid.

01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:51.708
What in the world are you afraid of?

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.260
What trauma did you endure
in your childhood?

01:35:54.333 --> 01:35:55.458
Come, let me take a look.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:56.874
Big sis.

01:35:57.417 --> 01:35:58.667
How should we deal with them?

01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:03.416
Very good.

01:36:04.042 --> 01:36:05.500
Look.

01:36:05.583 --> 01:36:07.041
Kiddo's wife is gorgeous,

01:36:07.125 --> 01:36:08.666
isn't she?

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:11.749
I told you.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:13.666
I'll help each of you find a wife.

01:36:14.667 --> 01:36:15.917
Each one of you.

01:36:16.417 --> 01:36:18.125
This was supposed to be a happy event.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.083
Very good.

01:36:24.917 --> 01:36:25.917
But

01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:30.250
brother number five is now dead.

01:36:30.833 --> 01:36:31.833
He died alone.

01:36:31.875 --> 01:36:32.916
So sad.

01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:36.333
You go and keep him company.

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.666
I'll get rid of all the memories you had
before you were ten.

01:36:44.833 --> 01:36:45.749
Done.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:47.208
Now you are someone

01:36:47.292 --> 01:36:49.125
without childhood memories.

01:36:53.333 --> 01:36:54.708
No.

01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:51.250
Big sis.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.500
Big sis.

01:38:54.417 --> 01:38:56.458
Master will never let you go free.

01:38:56.542 --> 01:38:58.292
If you are manly enough, tell me your name.

01:38:58.917 --> 01:39:01.333
I am the magic knuckle king.

01:39:03.167 --> 01:39:04.458
Just you wait and see.

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:06.833
Big sis.

01:39:14.625 --> 01:39:18.666
Our big hero...

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.125
Congratulations, all my fellow villagers!

01:39:23.208 --> 01:39:25.333
Because of my ability to remain calm
under pressure,

01:39:25.417 --> 01:39:27.292
and my invincible

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:29.250
fearless leadership,

01:39:29.333 --> 01:39:30.708
all the bandits are now gone.

01:39:30.792 --> 01:39:33.708
We killed all of them, from top to bottom.

01:39:33.792 --> 01:39:35.167
Liar!

01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:37.083
He's a liar!

01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:39.893
Fortune tien was planning to run away
with all the treasures we dug up.

01:39:39.917 --> 01:39:40.667
Tie him up.

01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:42.350
And split up the treasures among us all.

01:39:59.083 --> 01:40:00.083
Are you ok?

01:40:10.667 --> 01:40:11.875
Take this to the chief's wife.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.500
The big hero asked me to give this to you.

01:41:41.125 --> 01:41:43.250
This happened a year ago.

01:41:43.333 --> 01:41:45.624
I woke up that day suddenly.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:49.791
I found myself in a cave,

01:41:50.708 --> 01:41:53.291
wearing the worry ridder on my head.

01:41:53.375 --> 01:41:55.333
Inside the worry ridder,
there was a cocoon.

01:41:57.708 --> 01:41:59.916
Next to me was a dead body.

01:42:01.292 --> 01:42:03.125
I didn't know what had happened.

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:06.292
Nor could I remember who I was,

01:42:07.375 --> 01:42:09.041
or where I lived.

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:14.542
My brain was drawing a blank.

01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:19.375
There was

01:42:19.458 --> 01:42:22.041
a blurry face that belonged to a woman.

01:42:24.375 --> 01:42:26.750
I didn't know who she was,

01:42:26.833 --> 01:42:28.916
or why her shadow

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.583
would appear in my mind.

01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:35.416
Now I only have one wish.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.541
Please restore my soul.

01:42:38.417 --> 01:42:41.667
As long as you can help me
remember who I am,

01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.625
and who that woman was,

01:42:44.708 --> 01:42:46.541
I'll have no regrets.

01:42:48.333 --> 01:42:52.833
My cocoon is inside that cloth bag.

01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:55.041
The dark gray one.

01:42:59.417 --> 01:43:00.917
First flower,

01:43:03.125 --> 01:43:04.583
can you do that for me?

01:43:11.083 --> 01:43:12.916
Is there anything else
you would like to say?

01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:17.041
At least

01:43:19.125 --> 01:43:22.750
let me remember your face.

01:43:22.833 --> 01:43:24.541
Is that ok?

01:43:28.583 --> 01:43:30.499
Just think of it as a dream.

01:43:38.667 --> 01:43:40.542
If this is a dream,

01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:45.124
then after I wake up,

01:43:45.208 --> 01:43:46.708
what will I find?

01:43:50.875 --> 01:43:52.583
You are thinking way too much.

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.958
Done.

01:45:02.042 --> 01:45:03.167
Your soul has been restored.

01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:04.458
Thank you, madam chief!

01:45:11.250 --> 01:45:13.583
How are you, madam chief?

01:45:13.667 --> 01:45:15.292
About face!

01:45:15.625 --> 01:45:17.208
Run!

01:45:28.917 --> 01:45:30.875
<i>I helped the villagers restore their souls,</i>

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:33.916
<i>so they made me their chief.</i>

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.500
<i>I suggested we make some handicrafts</i>

01:45:44.583 --> 01:45:47.333
<i>and turn our village into a paradise.</i>

01:45:47.417 --> 01:45:49.250
<i>This way when the train comes,</i>

01:45:49.333 --> 01:45:52.583
<i>it will surely bring all of us wealth.</i>

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:04.999
<i>When I saw everyone practice
and prepare with joy,</i>

01:46:05.083 --> 01:46:09.083
<i>I realized the worries
I had before were unnecessary.</i>

01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:37.333
<i>I guess this is the
shangri-la I had in mind.</i>

01:47:38.167 --> 01:47:40.292
<i>Actually, I have another little secret.</i>

01:47:41.125 --> 01:47:43.708
<i>To face Dean without guilt,</i>

01:47:44.542 --> 01:47:45.458
<i>I made everyone forget</i>

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:47.875
<i>about my past with big pie
and fortune tien.</i>

01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:50.333
<i>This little selfishness of mine</i>

01:47:50.417 --> 01:47:52.375
<i>it's not too much, is it?</i>

01:49:02.458 --> 01:49:03.916
Butler huh,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.625
I think you've forgot something.

01:49:05.708 --> 01:49:06.999
What is it?

01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:08.874
Has any of the pigeons returned yet?

01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:09.958
It's been a while.

01:49:10.042 --> 01:49:10.542
No.

01:49:10.625 --> 01:49:12.500
But a mail deliverer has brought
us something.

01:49:12.583 --> 01:49:13.791
Why don't you bring him in?

01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:20.167
What is this?

01:49:23.292 --> 01:49:24.292
Dynamite!
