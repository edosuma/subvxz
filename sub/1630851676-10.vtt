ROBYN: There are things
in this world that no one

00:02.915 --> 00:05.831
should have to experience.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.529
And it is my job
to make them right.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.183
It's okay. We're the good guys.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.228
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:12.272 --> 00:14.753
This is Melody,
one of my oldest friends.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.364
[Mel grunts]How's it going, Harry?

00:16.407 --> 00:18.931
I need those
freaky-ass superpowers of yours.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.542
[grunts]

00:20.585 --> 00:22.065
I serve as an equalizer.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.632
It's what I was put
on this earth to do.

00:24.675 --> 00:25.937
[grunts]

00:28.593 --> 00:30.812

00:34.643 --> 00:36.340
MAN:
Whoo! Let's get them!

00:36.384 --> 00:38.777
[indistinct shouting, clamoring][dog barking]

00:38.820 --> 00:40.082
Get over here![glass shatters]

00:40.127 --> 00:41.823

00:41.866 --> 00:43.173

00:43.216 --> 00:44.869

Burn it to the ground!

00:49.918 --> 00:52.747
[screaming]RUTHIE:
Ella?

00:52.790 --> 00:54.271
Upstairs!

00:54.314 --> 00:55.968
[screaming continues]

00:58.448 --> 00:59.624
Ella!

00:59.667 --> 01:01.670
[grunting]

01:02.844 --> 01:04.063
Stay back!

01:07.370 --> 01:08.763
[Ruthie screams]

01:08.807 --> 01:10.331
We don't want no trouble. No!

01:10.373 --> 01:13.899
[screams]
Daddy!Ella, we have to go.

01:14.682 --> 01:15.858
Come on.[coughing]

01:15.900 --> 01:18.078
RUTHIE:
It's okay.Go.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.688
MAN:
Go on, grab it!

01:22.212 --> 01:23.647
[Ella crying]

01:26.477 --> 01:28.697
â™ª

01:37.271 --> 01:38.924
ROBYN: Y'all really
gonna make me choose?

01:38.968 --> 01:40.143
Come on, now. Stop stalling.

01:40.186 --> 01:42.145
Yeah, Mom. Which is better?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.801
Damn!Boom! Told you.
Almond flour was the move.

01:46.844 --> 01:48.151
[chuckles]Girl, congratulations.

01:48.194 --> 01:49.412
That means you can
start making breakfast

01:49.456 --> 01:52.634
for everybody from now on.Wait, what?

01:52.676 --> 01:54.810
[Robyn laughs]Good luck with that.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.813
Okay, no.

01:59.466 --> 02:01.816
That is not her recipe.
She set me up.

02:01.859 --> 02:04.427
Ooh, Aunt Vi with
the long game.

02:04.471 --> 02:06.561
What you got up for today?Vera's coming over.

02:06.603 --> 02:09.302
She's applying for the U.N.'s
youth internship program,

02:09.346 --> 02:11.913
and she asked me
for help on her essay.

02:11.956 --> 02:14.611
[doorbell rings]Smart, asking you.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.918
[chuckles]

02:15.961 --> 02:16.961
Okay, I'm out.VI: She's in the kitchen.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.181
Bye. Love you.Love you.

02:19.225 --> 02:21.228
Have fun.VERA:
Thanks.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.098
Hey, Vera.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.145
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.234
Of course.
I mean, United Nations?

02:27.276 --> 02:29.453
That's so exciting.I know, right?

02:29.497 --> 02:32.108
[chuckles]Okay.

02:32.151 --> 02:34.502
Let me know what you think.Okay.

02:36.546 --> 02:38.331
Um...

02:39.158 --> 02:41.465
Wait, is this a mistake?

02:41.509 --> 02:42.987
It says "Vera Lopez."

02:43.031 --> 02:45.207
I thought your last name
was Franks.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.776
Lopez is my middle name. My mom
thinks I stand a better chance

02:47.819 --> 02:49.820
if they know
I'm a minority candidate.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.215
But you're not.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.609
I kinda am.
Lopez is my middle name

02:54.651 --> 02:57.045
from my grandfather's side,
and I have the right to use it.

02:57.088 --> 03:00.049
Okay, but should you?

03:00.092 --> 03:01.268
I'm just saying

03:01.311 --> 03:03.051
I've known you
since junior high,

03:03.094 --> 03:04.487
and you've never said
you were anything but white.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.360
But now that being a minority
can help you...

03:07.403 --> 03:08.796
Does that

03:08.840 --> 03:10.450
not ring false to you?

03:10.493 --> 03:11.800
Why not use Franks

03:11.842 --> 03:13.280
and then put Lopez
as your middle name

03:13.323 --> 03:14.455
if that's true.

03:14.497 --> 03:15.890
It istrue.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.762
I wouldn't lie about that.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.241
And this program

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
could really help me
get into some good colleges.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.943
I thought you of all people
would understand.No,

03:24.986 --> 03:27.206
I mean, I want to help you.
It's just...

03:29.338 --> 03:32.037
I'm not sure
if I'm okay with this.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.388
Seriously, Dee?

03:37.086 --> 03:39.262
[chuckles]:
Wow.

03:39.305 --> 03:40.480
Fine.

03:46.312 --> 03:48.924
This painting you want me
to find. Do you have a photo?

03:48.966 --> 03:51.840
No. Just my grandmother's
descriptions.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.493
When was it stolen?On May 31,

03:53.537 --> 03:58.454
1921, from her house
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

03:58.498 --> 04:00.151
Tulsa?

04:00.195 --> 04:01.937
You don't mean...?

04:01.979 --> 04:04.765
The first night,
there were shootings.

04:04.808 --> 04:06.332
Fires came on the second.

04:06.376 --> 04:10.293
On the third, planes
dropped bombs.

04:10.336 --> 04:12.382
35 blocks of Black Wall Street

04:12.425 --> 04:16.211
burned to the ground
by race terrorists.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.302
My grandmother Ella was
left homeless that night.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.305
Her mother, Ruthie,
lost her life.

04:22.348 --> 04:25.134
The whole event
was just pure evil.

04:25.177 --> 04:28.050
And we're still living
with the scars.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.923
Ever heard
of Henry Ossawa Tanner?

04:31.966 --> 04:33.707
The artist. Course.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.014
Powerful work.At the turn of the century,

04:37.058 --> 04:38.713
my great-grandfather
commissioned him

04:38.755 --> 04:40.454
to do a portrait of Ruthie.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.673
This is a rough sketch

04:43.718 --> 04:46.024
from my grandmother's memory.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.112
That painting,

04:48.156 --> 04:49.593
along with trucks

04:49.637 --> 04:51.812
and supplies from our family's
shipping business,

04:51.855 --> 04:53.553
were stolen that night.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.514
Did your grandmother say by who?She was just a child.

04:58.514 --> 05:00.125
But she never forgot.

05:00.168 --> 05:03.651
Not their faces
or their laughter.

05:04.694 --> 05:06.870
It was the Nardoni Brothers.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.656
Wilford and Neil.As in...?

05:09.699 --> 05:12.355
Nardoni International Shipping.

05:12.399 --> 05:15.314
Their family built their empire

05:15.358 --> 05:17.882
on what was stolen from ours.

05:17.925 --> 05:19.362
Last year,

05:19.406 --> 05:21.843
Fortunedid a profile
on Roger Nardoni,

05:21.886 --> 05:25.716
great-grandson of Wilford.
Now owner of the company.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.500
You see that there?

05:27.543 --> 05:29.807
That's the corner
of the painting.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.156
It's in his home office.

05:31.199 --> 05:34.115
Or was when they took the photo.

05:34.158 --> 05:35.334
Have you contacted him?

05:35.377 --> 05:37.511
We have. Our lawyers have.

05:37.553 --> 05:40.557
But, of course, he denied it.
We even got the police to search

05:40.600 --> 05:43.298
his place, but they claimed
they couldn't find it.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.519
It'd be worth millions today.

05:45.562 --> 05:49.348
But it's not about the money.
[crying]

05:53.744 --> 05:56.180
Grandmother Ella is now 107,

05:56.225 --> 05:58.531
and she hasn't seen
her mother's face

05:58.574 --> 06:00.838
in over 100 years.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.709
Her dying wish

06:02.752 --> 06:06.583
is to see her one last time
before she passes.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.541
We know he has it.

06:08.584 --> 06:10.848
But we're at a
dead end here,

06:10.891 --> 06:14.329
and Grandmother Ella
doesn't have much time.

06:16.113 --> 06:18.420
Can you help us?

06:20.292 --> 06:21.728
DANTE:
Your client is right.

06:21.771 --> 06:24.295
Police did conduct a search
of Roger Nardoni's place

06:24.339 --> 06:27.211
five months ago.
Found nothing, but...

06:27.255 --> 06:29.475
But what?DANTE:
I doubt they looked very hard.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.651
Nardoni's a major donor
to the benevolent fund.

06:31.694 --> 06:34.654
Billionaires certainly know
how to hide their assets.

06:34.697 --> 06:37.048
Listen, you find something,
give me a call.

06:37.091 --> 06:39.399
Until then, I can't help you.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.355
Thanks.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.706
HARRY:
All right, Roger Nardoni.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.141
CEO, Nardoni Shipping.

06:44.185 --> 06:45.709
In the last hundred
years, they've expanded

06:45.752 --> 06:47.449
from trucks to tank barges.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.713
Now they run 25 container ships
to Asia and South America.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.802
Not exactly a "pull yourself up
by your bootstraps" kind of guy.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.067
His fortune, his business:
all inherited from his family.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.591
And all stolen
from someone else's.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.853
And this kind of injustice
leaves a legacy.

06:59.896 --> 07:01.202
Just like wealth.

07:01.245 --> 07:03.031
Gets passed down
through the generations.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.293
The first thing we need to
do is find that painting.

07:05.336 --> 07:07.817
Harry, dig into his life.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.471
See what you can learn.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.908
Where you going?

07:10.951 --> 07:12.170
Nardoni's.

07:12.213 --> 07:14.216
Cops may have tipped him
before the search

07:14.259 --> 07:15.608
so he could hide the painting.

07:15.651 --> 07:17.437
It's been long enough,
maybe he put it back.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.526
So you're gonna, what,
break into his house?

07:19.569 --> 07:22.658
Why break in
when I can be invited?

07:24.747 --> 07:26.663
Ms. Brandicott. Come.

07:26.706 --> 07:28.925
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

07:28.970 --> 07:32.538
Oh, anyone who moves half a
billion semiconductors a year

07:32.581 --> 07:34.105
is someone I can
make time for.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.499
Those are
impressive numbers.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.502
Not as impressive
as your art collection.

07:39.545 --> 07:41.372
You have
quite the eclectic taste.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.593
At least, to my untrained eye.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.725
It's true. My taste
spans the globe,

07:45.769 --> 07:46.944
just like my business.

07:46.987 --> 07:48.293
You're shipping
out of Taiwan?

07:48.336 --> 07:49.817
Port of Gaoxiong.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.341
I thought your company
had a contract with Maersk.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.778
We do. And we're not happy.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.040
But we want

07:56.084 --> 07:57.389
to avoid a potential frenzy,

07:57.432 --> 07:58.781
so we're not advertising.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.175
It's why you didn't want
to come to the office.

08:01.218 --> 08:03.831
Mr. Toshigi doesn't like rumors.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.661
What about this one?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.271
Ah.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.750
It's a Burchfield. 1916.

08:10.793 --> 08:12.927
1916? Really?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.449
The colors are vibrant.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.582
No cracking at all.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.499
It almost looks new.

08:20.324 --> 08:23.327
Well, like you said,
your eye is untrained.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.894
A-About your order.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.853
What kind of time frame
are you thinking about?

08:26.896 --> 08:29.596
As soon as possible
once we see numbers

08:29.639 --> 08:30.858
we like.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.163
Mr. Toshigi
would like bids by Friday.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.297
And if word leaks,

08:35.340 --> 08:36.645
you're out.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.386
But don't worry.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.692
From what I've seen,

08:39.735 --> 08:41.738
I have a feeling
we'll be talking again soon.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.219
It's the same frame,
but the painting is new.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.394
Designed to match
what's in the magazine.

08:46.437 --> 08:47.657
And when I asked Nardoni

08:47.701 --> 08:49.441
about it, his face lit up
with micro-tells.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.921
MEL:
He must've gotten spooked

08:50.965 --> 08:52.226
by the Watkins family inquiry.

08:52.269 --> 08:53.923
Swapped it out
to maintain deniability.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.447
He has it.

08:55.490 --> 08:57.927
Or he had it.
Question is where is it now?

08:57.971 --> 09:01.062
I think I might know.
Ever heard of The Vault?

09:01.105 --> 09:02.323
The warehouse in Brooklyn?

09:02.366 --> 09:04.152
That's a free port, right?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.023
A free port?It's a free trade zone.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.328
Mostly used to store goods

09:07.371 --> 09:08.591
in transit to avoid customs,

09:08.634 --> 09:10.461
but billionaires like to keep

09:10.505 --> 09:12.333
their art there because,
technically, it's considered

09:12.376 --> 09:13.769
outside the country,
so, you know,

09:13.813 --> 09:15.597
they don't have
to pay duties and taxes on it.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.338
And that's legal?HARRY:
It's one of a thousand loopholes

09:17.381 --> 09:18.948
these guys like to exploit.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.081
The day before the cops

09:20.124 --> 09:21.604
raided Nardoni's place, right,

09:21.648 --> 09:24.563
he moved a bunch of items
from his place to the free port.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.349
And I think the Watkins family
portrait might be one of them.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.307
So, how do I get in?You don't.

09:30.351 --> 09:31.614
The place's security

09:31.658 --> 09:32.572
rivals Fort Knox,

09:32.615 --> 09:34.225
and that's the known layer.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.139
There's an unknown layer?

09:36.183 --> 09:38.447
The inside
is cloaked in secrecy.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.534
Check it out.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.275
The security design team

09:41.318 --> 09:42.798
not only consisted
of former Secret Service

09:42.842 --> 09:45.672
but of legendary art thief
turned security expert

09:45.715 --> 09:48.370
Omer Eldad.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.937
I mean,
he's the best in the biz.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.634
However good you are
at getting into places, this guy

09:52.678 --> 09:54.115
is better at keeping people out.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.639
Maybe I can't get in, but...

09:56.682 --> 09:59.163
I know someone who can.

09:59.206 --> 10:01.470
["Wicked Ones"
by Dorothy playing]

10:01.513 --> 10:03.471
Jessie Cook.

10:03.514 --> 10:05.255
They call her The Worm.

10:05.299 --> 10:07.171
She's a savant-level thief.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.999
Rumored to have
photographic memory.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.307
Legendary for breaking into
high-security places.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.177
She's gifted. Brilliant.

10:14.221 --> 10:16.224
The best at what she does.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.399
But she's also
out of her damn mind.

10:21.707 --> 10:23.578
She's devious, unpredictable,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.972
totally amoral
and only cares about herself.

10:26.015 --> 10:27.801
You've worked
with her before.Bishop

10:27.844 --> 10:30.412
recruited her to help me
infiltrate a Chinese naval base.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.066
Halfway in, she decides

10:32.109 --> 10:33.807
she needs a bigger payday.

10:33.850 --> 10:34.807
She wouldn't move

10:34.850 --> 10:36.244
until he wired the funds.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.506
We barely made it
out of there alive.HARRY: So,

10:38.549 --> 10:39.899
maybe you don't call her.

10:40.726 --> 10:43.424
Doing this ourselves
would take weeks,

10:43.467 --> 10:44.991
maybe months to plan.

10:45.034 --> 10:47.864
Grandma Ella
doesn't have that kind of time.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.386
We gonna pull this off,

10:49.431 --> 10:51.693
we need The Worm.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.216
But if she only cares
about herself,

10:53.260 --> 10:54.523
what makes you think
she'll help?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.003
Because I know
what makes her tick.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.395
We just have to find her.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.745

Oh, you are quite the charmer.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.970
Why don't you finish up
your drink.

11:07.014 --> 11:10.191
I'm gonna get freshened up,
and I'll be right back.

11:42.265 --> 11:45.008
[inhales]
Aren't you

11:45.052 --> 11:47.053
a pretty girl.

11:47.096 --> 11:48.576
Oh!

11:48.620 --> 11:50.013
Thanks, girl.
You shouldn't have.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.841
â™ª We the wicked ones,
the wicked ones. â™ª

11:57.586 --> 12:01.850
What's that, about 20 carats?22.

12:01.894 --> 12:03.634
Diamonds don't seem
like your thing, Robbie.

12:03.678 --> 12:07.248
You're more of, like,
a gunmetal leather kind of girl.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.640
Like this jewel, I am

12:09.684 --> 12:11.774
multifaceted.Why are you here?

12:11.817 --> 12:13.732
And I know you're not here
for that rock.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.431
I got a job for you.Oh, no.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.866
I don't work for other people.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.956
Especially people who talk
about me behind my back.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.001
Talk behind...

12:22.044 --> 12:23.480
I was debriefed by the CIA.

12:23.524 --> 12:26.222
You didn't have to
tell them everything.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.658
You detonated a bomb.

12:27.702 --> 12:29.792
As a distraction.
I was improvising.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.142
You almost improvised me
into the afterlife.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.883
Oh, stop whining. You lived.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.494
Speaking of bombs,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.669
we should go.

12:38.713 --> 12:39.932
Thank you.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.063
Seriously?

12:41.107 --> 12:42.413
We don't have much time,

12:42.456 --> 12:44.284
but if you'd like to stay,
be my guest.

12:44.327 --> 12:45.373
Stay out of my way.

12:45.415 --> 12:46.982
I'm hitting The Vault.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.506
The Vault?

12:49.551 --> 12:51.073
The Holy Grail.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.033
Imagine the bragging rights.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.511
What's the score?

12:54.556 --> 12:56.471
A painting. It was stolen

12:56.514 --> 12:58.038
from a family
during the Tulsa massacre.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.342
I'm returning it

12:59.386 --> 13:00.953
to its proper owners.

13:00.996 --> 13:02.869
Restitution. Noble.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.087
What's in it for me?

13:05.131 --> 13:07.177
It's in billionaire
Roger Nardoni's vault.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.525
Help me get in,

13:08.570 --> 13:09.831
anything else that's in there
is yours.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.181
No way.

13:11.225 --> 13:14.445
That's insane. Nobody has
ever breached The Vault.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.969
Be the first.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.101
I do love being the first.

13:19.145 --> 13:21.495
So? What do you say?

13:21.538 --> 13:23.019
[watch beeps]

13:23.062 --> 13:24.890
Ooh. I say we got to go.

Why do you always have
to blow everything up?

13:30.940 --> 13:32.201
'Cause it works.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.118

What are you
still doing up?Can't sleep.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.998
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.086
Want to talk about it?

13:46.129 --> 13:47.390
No.

13:47.434 --> 13:48.870
Maybe.

13:48.914 --> 13:50.046
Okay.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.307
Yes.

13:51.351 --> 13:53.875
I had a fight with Vera.About what?

13:53.919 --> 13:55.616
Her essay.

13:55.659 --> 13:58.880
Her last name is Franks, but
she's using her grandfather's

13:58.924 --> 14:01.710
last name, Lopez,
because her mom thinks

14:01.753 --> 14:04.931
she'll have a better chance at
getting into the U.N. program.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.453
I mean, don't you think
that's unethical?

14:06.496 --> 14:08.238
Do youthink it's unethical?Yes.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.587
She's lying about her name
to get a minority slot.

14:10.631 --> 14:12.851
But she's not lying
about her heritage.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.375
No, but you'd never know that
by the way that she acts.

14:15.418 --> 14:17.595
It's not who she is.

14:17.639 --> 14:20.293
And you told her
how you felt?Course I did.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.558
Dee, I just love how you stand
up for what you believe in,

14:24.601 --> 14:28.258
but, you know, everything
isn't always so black-and-white.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.693
I know.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.261
I want to talk it out,

14:32.306 --> 14:33.654
but I have a feeling

14:33.697 --> 14:35.831
she never wants
to speak to me again.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.312
Do you think
I should've just let it go?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.356
No. I don't think that, either.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.489
When I was your age,

14:41.532 --> 14:43.577
I wasn't always sure who I was

14:43.620 --> 14:46.494
because that is a process,
honey.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.408
It takes time.

14:48.451 --> 14:50.453
Instead of calling her out,

14:50.498 --> 14:54.023
maybe you want to consider
calling her in.

14:59.158 --> 15:01.335
Go to bed.Night.

15:11.735 --> 15:12.868
Oh.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.956
Where are we?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.479
That's need to know,

15:15.523 --> 15:16.784
and you don't need to know.

15:16.827 --> 15:19.961
Harry, Mel,
meet Jessie Cook.

15:20.005 --> 15:21.006
The Worm.

15:21.049 --> 15:24.357
Oh, okay.
Is this your little crew?

15:24.400 --> 15:25.663
Cute.

15:25.706 --> 15:27.403
I hope she told you

15:27.447 --> 15:29.144
I'm a solo act?

15:29.188 --> 15:31.147
We heard all about your act.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.669
The Met, the Getty

15:32.713 --> 15:35.107
and the Louvre.
That's quite the hat trick.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.500
Well, I do love a challenge.

15:37.544 --> 15:38.937
HARRY:
Is it true

15:38.980 --> 15:40.764
you escaped the Louvre
in a stolen speedboat?

15:40.808 --> 15:42.898
It is. That was pretty epic.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.725
But what's the point
in doing anything

15:44.769 --> 15:46.509
if you're not gonna have
a little fun along the way?

15:46.553 --> 15:48.076
ROBYN:
Fun over function.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.426
Story of your life.

Stick, meet ass.

15:52.690 --> 15:53.952
Story of yours.

15:55.040 --> 15:55.823
HARRY:
Wow.

15:55.866 --> 15:58.913
So, The Vault.Right, yeah.

15:58.957 --> 16:02.308
I managed to hack
the client portal

16:02.351 --> 16:03.701
and pull some blueprints.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.355
Nardoni's unit is right here,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.619
but unfortunately, the only
system I was able access

16:08.663 --> 16:09.880
were surveillance cams.

16:09.924 --> 16:10.926
For the rest of his security,

16:10.970 --> 16:12.448
we're completely in the dark.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.321
All right, well,
let me turn some lights on

16:14.364 --> 16:16.018
for you. They use
a mix of high-tech

16:16.062 --> 16:17.323
and practical systems.

16:17.366 --> 16:19.803
Now, you can access any floor
with a key card,

16:19.847 --> 16:22.371
but the hallways
are gonna be blanketed

16:22.416 --> 16:25.027
with state-of-the-art
motion sensors.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.768
Now, here's another
little, fun tidbit.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.205
Each main hallway is protected

16:29.249 --> 16:31.380
by these random pressure plates

16:31.424 --> 16:32.730
under the tile.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.298
Step on one
and the world comes running.

16:35.341 --> 16:37.212
Hold on a second. How can you
possibly know all this?

16:37.256 --> 16:39.955
I mean,
their security is top secret.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.610
Let's just say

16:42.653 --> 16:44.480
I went to the source.

16:44.524 --> 16:45.655
You didn't.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.744
Oh, yeah, I did.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.398
I bumped into him in Santorini,

16:48.442 --> 16:50.269
and we bumped all night.

16:50.312 --> 16:52.793
After about ten ouzos,

16:52.836 --> 16:56.798
he could not stop bragging
about his impenetrable system.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.234
You dudes really love

16:58.278 --> 16:59.975
chatting it up
about your equipment.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.889
[chuckles]
Okay, well...Yeah, they do. [chuckles]

17:01.932 --> 17:03.847
What are you laughing at?It was funny.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.111
JESSIE:
Once he passed out,

17:05.153 --> 17:06.763
I got the schematics
off his laptop.

17:06.807 --> 17:10.202
Did you download them?Hell no. It's all up here.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.204
But it's useless.

17:12.248 --> 17:15.034
It's the outer layer that makes
The Vault the Holy Grail.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.383
Reinforced steel,

17:16.425 --> 17:18.384
biometric security,

17:18.428 --> 17:19.994

17:20.038 --> 17:22.214
Every package
that's delivered

17:22.258 --> 17:24.652
has to be authorized
by the client's voiceprint.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.827
If the computer
does not recognize

17:26.871 --> 17:28.263
that voiceprint exactly,

17:28.307 --> 17:31.788
the facility is not accepting
that delivery.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.617
Who's authorized
on Nardoni's account?

17:34.662 --> 17:35.836
[keys clacking]

17:35.880 --> 17:38.012
HARRY:
James Decker.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.840
His right-hand man.Wow.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.494
Looks like he'd
be fun at parties.HARRY: Well,

17:41.538 --> 17:43.236
you can find out, actually.

17:43.278 --> 17:44.759
He and Nardoni are scheduled
to be at an art auction

17:44.801 --> 17:45.846
later today.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.631
You thinking what I'm thinking?

17:47.674 --> 17:49.459
JESSIE:
Wait a minute.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.765
What you thinking?

17:50.807 --> 17:53.159
Mel, you have anything
in your closet

17:53.201 --> 17:56.030
that just screams,
"I like to spend money"?

17:58.381 --> 18:00.644
[indistinct chatter]

18:03.733 --> 18:07.520
HARRY:
Wow. That is a great outfit.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.479
You do look money, honey.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.828
Let's hope
Decker thinks so, too.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.440
All righty,
voice capture software

18:13.482 --> 18:15.355
is online.

18:15.397 --> 18:16.486
Okay, six o'clock.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.965
He's headed your way.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.315
Did a little research.

18:19.358 --> 18:21.143
He's a history buff.
He collects watches.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.491
Got it.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.755
Oh! I'm so sorry.[chuckles]

18:24.798 --> 18:27.845
Are you okay, miss?Yeah. It's totally my fault.

18:27.888 --> 18:29.499
My mother always said
I was clumsy.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.153
DECKER:
You make clumsy look good.

18:31.196 --> 18:34.113
[gasps]
Wow. That is a nice watch.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.679
DECKER:
Ah, thank you.

18:35.722 --> 18:36.767
It's a classic.Oh.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.682
1917 caged trench watch from...

18:39.727 --> 18:40.944
World War I?

18:40.989 --> 18:43.164
It's exquisite.Ah. Fellow horophile?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.905
Sure. Yeah.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.864
Then you'll appreciate
that I'm the second person

18:46.907 --> 18:48.344
to own this piece.[Mel gasps]

18:48.387 --> 18:50.302
Okay, great. You're doing great,
honey. I just need

18:50.346 --> 18:52.347
an "ow" and a "zzz."

18:52.392 --> 18:54.262
Is that right?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.786
Yes. The original owner

18:55.829 --> 18:58.441
was a quirky Brit.
A military man.

18:58.484 --> 18:59.528
Hmm.HARRY: Mention

18:59.573 --> 19:01.704
the Anglo-Zanzibar War.

19:01.749 --> 19:05.230
He must have fought
in the Anglo-Manzibar War.[chuckles]

19:05.273 --> 19:10.060
You mean the Anglo-Zanzibar War.MEL:
Yes.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.366
DECKER:
Did you know that was actually

19:11.411 --> 19:13.152
the shortest recorded
war in history?

19:13.194 --> 19:14.457
Really?Good, good, good.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.806
I still just need an "ow."

19:15.849 --> 19:17.634
Um, "cow,"

19:17.678 --> 19:19.722
"thou," "plow."Hmm.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.071
[stomps]Ow!

19:21.115 --> 19:23.074
MEL:
I am so sorry.That'll do.

19:23.117 --> 19:25.032
I told you, I'm clumsy.
[chuckles]

19:25.076 --> 19:26.903
You know what,
I'm gonna give you some space.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.124
Okay. Did you get that?

19:29.167 --> 19:32.126
Loud and clear. Just gonna
put it together. Meanwhile...

19:32.171 --> 19:34.738
I know. I better get changed.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.056
Delivery for Roger Nardoni.

19:48.098 --> 19:51.538
Nothing's scheduled for today.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.931
Seriously? They said that
they were gonna call you.

19:53.974 --> 19:57.500
Can you please check?[phone ringing]

19:57.544 --> 19:58.980
Hold on a sec.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.115
[ringing continues]Yep?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.465
DECKER'S VOICE:
This is James Decker

20:06.509 --> 20:09.469
calling in a delivery
for Roger Nardoni.

20:09.511 --> 20:11.992
Single crate. A sculpture.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.998
Thank you, Mr. Decker.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.306
You're clear.Thanks.

20:30.184 --> 20:33.188
Hey, hold on a sec. Stop.[brakes screech]

20:37.018 --> 20:38.714
You're riding low
on your left rear.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.368
You might want to
get some air.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.067
Will do.
Appreciate it.

20:51.858 --> 20:53.861
[wood creaking]

21:02.042 --> 21:03.913
I can't believe
you brought snacks.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.699
You don't want to know me
when I'm hungry.

21:05.741 --> 21:07.221
I'm not sure I want to
know you now.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.484
Don't forget,
I'm doing youa favor.

21:09.528 --> 21:11.226
Bishop should have
never recruited you

21:11.269 --> 21:12.705
from that prison in Marseille.

21:12.749 --> 21:16.012
I would have escaped anyway.
Ooh.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.189
Just so you know,
this ain't Nardoni's vault.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.671
Harry, where the hell are we?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.325
Remember that path

21:23.368 --> 21:26.109
we meticulously planned from
Nardoni's vault to the exit?

21:26.153 --> 21:27.328
You're nowhere near it.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.416
Looks like you're in
some sort of

21:28.461 --> 21:29.722
secure holding room

21:29.766 --> 21:30.854
on the opposite side
of the facility

21:30.897 --> 21:31.898
with God knows what in between.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.727
In other words, we're screwed.

21:33.769 --> 21:35.468
That's about right.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.955
Harry?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.219
Harry, can you hear me?

21:48.262 --> 21:50.787
Concrete's blocking
the signal.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.484
Let's go.
No.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.009
We don't know if he has
control of the cameras yet.

21:55.051 --> 21:57.403
There's only one way
to find out.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.144
[whispering]:
What are you doing?

22:05.888 --> 22:08.718
You hear any sirens? No.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.329
We're fine.No, we're not fine.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.505
He has the map.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.983
We don't know where we're going.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.160
I learned early in this world

22:16.203 --> 22:18.162
you can only depend on yourself.

22:18.205 --> 22:21.470
I memorized those blueprints.
It's this way.

22:23.906 --> 22:25.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.609
Actually, it's this way.

22:30.653 --> 22:34.221
I'm thinking about the-the
blueprints upside down.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.009
Wait, wait, wait!
What?

22:40.054 --> 22:42.185
You see those sconces?

22:42.230 --> 22:44.840
They are next-gen
motion detectors.

22:44.884 --> 22:45.885
Had 'em in the Louvre.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.539
You so much as bat an eyelash

22:47.583 --> 22:49.063
and you set them off.

22:49.105 --> 22:51.152
How do we get past them?

22:51.194 --> 22:54.721
Well, it just depends if they
updated the software.

22:54.763 --> 22:57.157
If it's new firmware, we won't.

22:57.201 --> 23:00.422
But if the firmware is old...

23:01.989 --> 23:03.990
What are you doing?

23:07.385 --> 23:11.040
Too many data points overwhelmed
the old software.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.565
It's logged in as an error.

23:12.607 --> 23:14.305
And then the system
just reboots itself.

23:14.348 --> 23:16.568
Wait for it.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.614
Five, four,

23:18.657 --> 23:21.311
three, two...

23:21.355 --> 23:22.575
Yes!

23:22.617 --> 23:24.315
The system just rebooted itself.

23:24.358 --> 23:27.275
We got 15 seconds.
Race you.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.632
Damn, Robbie,
you getting slow.

23:36.675 --> 23:39.329
Keep it up, you gonna
get us caught.What the hell, Jess?

23:39.374 --> 23:41.723
Next time, tell me
before you take off.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.422
Oh, here you go.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.901
You know, it's just like China.

23:44.944 --> 23:47.034
It's not you, it's me.
You know what?

23:47.076 --> 23:48.775
It's not my fault
if you can't keep up.

23:48.817 --> 23:50.124
Girl, I'm gonna hurt you.

23:50.166 --> 23:52.125
Did I not just
get us to the door

23:52.169 --> 23:53.605
of the stairwell?

23:53.648 --> 23:57.131
Is Nardoni's unit not upstairs
and down the hall?

23:57.173 --> 23:59.480
I would think you would
stop criticizing me

23:59.525 --> 24:02.657
and just be a little bit
more impressed.

24:02.701 --> 24:05.182
Just open the door.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.142
What?

24:10.536 --> 24:11.450
I need a key card.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.321
No. You cannot need
a key card.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.105
Because you said you would
get a key card.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.499
You said it'd be easy to get.

24:17.542 --> 24:18.979
Okay, so my source
didn't come through.

24:19.021 --> 24:20.414
So I'm gonna improv.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.721
I'm gonna improv!Improv? No, no, no, no.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.505
I hate your improv.

24:26.551 --> 24:28.509
[grunts]

24:28.554 --> 24:30.643
[chuckles]

24:31.991 --> 24:33.689
Easy peasy sleazy.

24:33.732 --> 24:36.561
Yeah, except now we have
an unconscious guard.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.652
It's cool. Just tie his ass up
and throw him in there.

24:39.694 --> 24:42.132
If you would have gotten
a card beforehand,

24:42.175 --> 24:43.612
we could have been
in and out of here

24:43.655 --> 24:44.874
without anyone ever knowing.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.528
Every good plan needs
a little improv.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.269
You know, like jazz.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.707
Jazz my ass.
Now we're on the clock.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.143
What if he wakes up?

24:53.186 --> 24:55.144
What if he manages to get help?

24:55.189 --> 24:57.670
Well, we can always kill him.

24:57.712 --> 25:00.063
We don't have to worry
about him waking up then.

25:00.106 --> 25:01.238
Would that make you happy?

25:01.281 --> 25:04.372
No. But shooting you would.

25:04.414 --> 25:06.895
I said I would get a card,

25:06.940 --> 25:08.855
and I got a card.

25:08.897 --> 25:11.683
Show a little gratitude.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.685
Just a teeny, teeny bit.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.557
[lock beeps]

25:16.731 --> 25:18.211
All right.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.257
This is the floor
I was talking about.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.954
Random pressure plates.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.391
Now, all the tiles
look the same,

25:23.433 --> 25:25.914
but if you step on the
wrong one, party over.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.875
And you memorized it?Yes.

25:28.917 --> 25:32.226
From a guy you were
drinking with.Yes.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.880
How many years ago?Three.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.230
How much ouzo?

25:36.272 --> 25:40.407
Now, why would I do anything
to jeopardize me?

25:41.278 --> 25:45.239
Just take every step
that I take.

25:50.896 --> 25:53.115
Whoa!

25:54.290 --> 25:57.032
Is it here, or is it there?
[chuckles]

25:57.076 --> 25:59.122
Relax. Have some fun.

25:59.165 --> 26:01.211
Remember that night in Macao

26:01.255 --> 26:02.385
with the tiger
and the motorcycle?

26:02.430 --> 26:05.432
[laughs]
That was fun.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.740
Yeah. And we got the
access codes, right?

26:07.782 --> 26:09.523
So just chill, I got you.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.657
Nardoni's unit is
right down there.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.876
Oh. You hear that?

26:14.921 --> 26:16.704
What?

26:17.750 --> 26:18.968
Wait. Wait.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.143
I didn't see
where you stepped.

26:20.186 --> 26:22.667
I know.What are you doing?

26:24.365 --> 26:27.367
You know I didn't just
come here for that painting.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.760
This'll only take a minute.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.285
No. Get back here.
This is not our mission.

26:31.327 --> 26:33.374
Back soon. Don't move.

26:34.722 --> 26:38.117
Like I have a choice.

26:41.511 --> 26:44.124
[grunting]

26:49.172 --> 26:50.520
[Robyn sighs]

26:52.522 --> 26:54.351
Damn.

26:54.394 --> 26:57.310
Okay...
it's gotta be that one.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.666
Okay, one down,

27:05.711 --> 27:07.669
another dozen to go.[door opens]

27:08.451 --> 27:10.628
[door closes, beeps]

27:12.065 --> 27:14.371
GUARD:
Hallway seven is clear.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.335
[grunts]

27:21.377 --> 27:23.467
I told you, I got you.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.686
Let's go to Nardoni's
vault. Come on.

27:30.648 --> 27:34.695
Just like that,
we in, baby. Yes!

27:34.740 --> 27:36.001
You did that.

27:36.045 --> 27:39.569
Don't touch me.
Start with those.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.921
â™ª I'm a little bit lady
and a lot of bit freak â™ª

27:41.963 --> 27:44.314
â™ª Call me Sabrina,
got tricks you never seen â™ª

27:44.357 --> 27:45.837
â™ª Calling all the shots,
got pins like voodoo â™ª

27:45.881 --> 27:48.057
â™ª I'm only bad news
if I'm coming for you â™ª

27:48.101 --> 27:50.843
â™ª 'Cause I'm the CEO.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.454
Yo, Robbie.Don't call me that.

27:55.934 --> 27:57.326
You remember when you told me

27:57.371 --> 27:59.328
that if I helped you out,
I could have

27:59.373 --> 28:00.940
anything I want in the vault?

28:00.982 --> 28:02.768
That was before your little
side hustle back there.

28:02.810 --> 28:03.898
Well, it doesn't matter,

28:03.942 --> 28:05.378
'cause all of this
is worthless.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.468
What do you mean?I'm an art thief.

28:07.510 --> 28:10.297
This is what I do.
This is all junk.

28:10.339 --> 28:12.167
But the invoices...

28:12.211 --> 28:15.867
So Nardoni sells this piece
to an idiot

28:15.911 --> 28:17.433
for $12 million.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.653
Sells this other piece over here
for, like, seven.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.743
These pieces are barely worth
the cost of the frames

28:22.788 --> 28:24.789
they're sitting in.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.095
This is money laundering.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.531
Who are the buyers?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.231
Wyatt Gardner.I know that name.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.059
He's the CEO
of Carthage Chemicals.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.452
I'm starting to detect a theme

28:36.497 --> 28:38.673
because this piece over here

28:38.717 --> 28:41.807
he sold to
a Banotide Chemical Company

28:41.849 --> 28:42.938
for, like, $11 million.

28:42.981 --> 28:44.243
And I mean, this is something

28:44.287 --> 28:47.115
my two-year-old nephew could do.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.292
What about these?

28:50.336 --> 28:51.424
This is what he's been buying.

28:51.468 --> 28:55.211
Meh, same thing.
Worthless.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.646
What is he doing?

28:56.691 --> 28:58.432
Whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

28:58.474 --> 29:01.000
We've got a painting to find.
Come on.

29:01.042 --> 29:03.567
[breathing heavily]

29:06.875 --> 29:08.659
[groans]

29:17.798 --> 29:18.844
Yo, McCall.

29:26.199 --> 29:29.462
Wow. She is beautiful.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.382
[alarm blaring]

[guard shouting in distance]

29:39.994 --> 29:41.823
Hey, help me with this.

29:41.866 --> 29:43.128
Guards! We gotta go.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.913
[indistinct shouting
in distance]

29:44.957 --> 29:48.351
Robbie, now!
Come on!

29:48.394 --> 29:50.962
GUARD:
Lock it down! Lock it down!

29:55.881 --> 29:58.971
[alarm blaring]JESSIE: Hell yeah!

29:59.013 --> 30:00.885
Stolen van,
people shooting at us!

30:03.148 --> 30:05.412
Now, that's living!
Come on, now.

30:05.454 --> 30:07.761
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
You see that gate?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.851
â™ª I'm the CEO,
on the top shelf, yeah â™ª

30:09.894 --> 30:10.808
â™ª I'm the top pick

30:10.852 --> 30:11.940
Yo!

30:11.983 --> 30:13.462
â™ª I'm-a let you know it,
made a deal â™ª

30:13.507 --> 30:16.249
â™ª With the devil,
now I own him â™ª

30:16.291 --> 30:17.641
â™ª Got nothing on me... [shouting]

30:17.684 --> 30:21.428
We got away scot-free.
We got away scot-free!

30:21.471 --> 30:24.125
[tires screech]Come on, now!

30:24.170 --> 30:26.780
That was awesome.
Next time I drive.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.086
Next time?

30:28.130 --> 30:29.784
Do you understand
what you did?

30:29.827 --> 30:32.613
That little detour of yours
cost me my one shot

30:32.655 --> 30:35.615
at retrieving that painting.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.836
And for what? Some earrings?

30:42.491 --> 30:44.930
Those aren't just
any earrings.

30:44.972 --> 30:46.365
Those are the matching set

30:46.409 --> 30:48.628
to Marie Antoinette's
strand necklace, okay.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.021
Which I stole from the Louvre.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.633
That's what this was about:
a matching set.

30:52.675 --> 30:54.590
I knew you were
gonna try something.

30:54.634 --> 30:58.377
Still, I wanted to believe
that you were better than that.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.901
What about what
this meant for me?

30:59.944 --> 31:03.296
Okay, this was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

31:03.338 --> 31:04.818
Do you hear yourself?

31:04.863 --> 31:09.040
You just sacrificed this
family's rightful legacy.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.826
A dying woman's wish
to remember her mother's face.

31:11.869 --> 31:14.133
For your selfishness
and greed.

31:14.175 --> 31:16.134
We can still get the painting.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.397
How? We can't get back in.

31:18.441 --> 31:21.443
I don't know how yet,
but something will work out.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.490
It always does.

31:24.883 --> 31:29.409
It must be really lonely
only caring about yourself.

31:32.106 --> 31:34.153
I hope they were worth it.

31:34.195 --> 31:36.894
Come on, Robbie, you can't...Get out.

31:37.982 --> 31:39.375
We're done.

31:41.942 --> 31:43.902
Cool.

31:46.164 --> 31:48.557
[doorbell rings]

31:50.298 --> 31:51.822
Hey, Dee.
I just came by

31:51.865 --> 31:53.563
to tell you that
you can stop calling

31:53.606 --> 31:55.739
and texting and DMing
me obsessively.

31:55.782 --> 31:58.351
Fine. I will leave you alone.No.

31:58.394 --> 32:01.354
Can I come in?

32:11.885 --> 32:14.627
Listen, I was already feeling
weird about the name thing,

32:14.671 --> 32:16.455
and then you called me on it.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.719
I was honestly just
trying to protect you.

32:18.761 --> 32:21.895
You could be canceled
if anyone found out.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.594
But I should probably keep
my opinions to myself.

32:24.637 --> 32:27.554
But, Dee, what you said,
it made me think about

32:27.596 --> 32:29.817
who I am and where I came from.

32:29.859 --> 32:33.125
I never paid any attention to it
or asked any questions about it.

32:33.167 --> 32:35.910
Like why no one in my family

32:35.953 --> 32:37.346
ever spoke a word
of Spanish to me,

32:37.390 --> 32:39.347
or why we don't celebrate
the holidays

32:39.392 --> 32:40.609
that my grandparents did.

32:40.653 --> 32:42.047
Did you ask them?Yeah.

32:42.089 --> 32:44.570
They weren't too happy about it
at first, either.

32:44.614 --> 32:47.922
But once we all got
over ourselves,

32:47.965 --> 32:51.011
I learned a lot about why
my grandfather

32:51.056 --> 32:52.709
wanted us to assimilate,

32:52.752 --> 32:54.102
and how they passed that on
to my mother.

32:54.145 --> 32:57.932
There was a whole part of
who I am that was missing,

32:57.976 --> 32:59.933
and I didn't even know it.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.938
That's what I want to
write my essay about.

33:03.981 --> 33:07.986
So, will you help me?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.423
Yes.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.251
I would love to help you
write about that.

33:13.295 --> 33:16.167
Okay, come on.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.646
I had it.
It was right there.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.345
All right, there's gotta be
a way to get the painting.

33:19.387 --> 33:22.000
Well, we can't break back in.
They'll be prepared for that.

33:23.522 --> 33:26.265
But those junk paintings
of Nardoni's...

33:26.307 --> 33:28.222
If we can figure out
what he's doing,

33:28.267 --> 33:29.659
maybe we can leverage him.

33:29.702 --> 33:31.313
I think I might be able to help.
Check this out.

33:31.356 --> 33:33.097
Ten years ago, both the Banotide

33:33.141 --> 33:35.490
and Carthage Chemical companies
were fined by the EPA

33:35.535 --> 33:37.405
for illegally dumping
toxic waste

33:37.450 --> 33:39.191
in rural areas in the Midwest.

33:39.233 --> 33:41.801
They had to pay huge settlements
to some communities

33:41.845 --> 33:43.281
where there were spikes
in cancer levels.

33:43.325 --> 33:44.805
And supposedly they
cleaned up their act, but...

33:44.847 --> 33:46.459
You think the companies
paid Nardoni

33:46.501 --> 33:48.068
to get rid of
their waste for them.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.809
Well, why else would they be
spending millions on junk art?

33:49.853 --> 33:51.072
I mean, clearly
they're payoffs.

33:51.115 --> 33:53.378
Jessie said this was
money laundering.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.468
So this waste, where
are they shipping it?

33:55.510 --> 33:56.859
To poor countries.

33:56.903 --> 33:59.471
Nardoni is bribing local
officials in the same way

33:59.515 --> 34:01.560
by overpaying
for worthless art.

34:01.604 --> 34:03.563
Look, I tracked the names.
Check it out.

34:03.605 --> 34:05.217
These villages are suffering
the same sorts

34:05.259 --> 34:08.132
of cancer clusters as
the towns in the Midwest.

34:08.175 --> 34:11.309
So he's building a fortune
by destroying communities.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.398
Just like his family did
in Tulsa.

34:13.442 --> 34:14.922
But without those paintings,

34:14.965 --> 34:16.489
we have to figure out
a way to prove it.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.143
[phone rings]

34:19.186 --> 34:20.449
Ms. Watkins?

34:20.492 --> 34:21.797
I'm sorry to bother you.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.626
Don't apologize.
How's your grandmother?

34:24.670 --> 34:26.976
The doctors say she doesn't
have much time left.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.197
All right, Miss Ella.
Just relax.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.157
I was hoping you might have
some good news to share.

34:32.199 --> 34:33.505
I'm sorry, not yet.

34:33.548 --> 34:35.943
But we're still trying.Rob?

34:35.985 --> 34:38.858
I'll call you back as soon
as I have something, I promise.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.213
What do we got?We may be too late.

34:46.257 --> 34:48.650
Nardoni's emptying his space.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.043
He's making the evidence

34:50.088 --> 34:52.132
and the Watkins family
painting disappear.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.742
If he ends up
shipping this overseas

34:53.786 --> 34:56.355
to another free port,
we've lost our proof.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.704
We can't let that happen.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.719
Don't move.Hands on the handle.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.634
Hands. Come on!

35:14.677 --> 35:16.201
[flex-cuff tightens]

35:16.244 --> 35:18.942
I'll check the cargo area.ROBYN: Okay.

35:22.815 --> 35:26.646
I got Dante on speed dial.
You find anything?

35:26.688 --> 35:30.128
I'll take your weapon. Now!

35:38.353 --> 35:42.356
So, I guess I shouldn't worry
about getting that bid in

35:42.400 --> 35:45.012
to Mr. Toshigi.
Who do you work for?

35:45.054 --> 35:48.581
I mean, it must not be
Customs or the EPA or FBI;

35:48.623 --> 35:50.713
you'd have IDs, badges.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.150
A hundred years ago,
your grandparents

35:53.193 --> 35:55.282
stole a legacy.

35:55.327 --> 35:56.936
I'm here to get it back.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.418
Wait...

35:59.460 --> 36:01.114
this is about that painting?

36:01.159 --> 36:04.945
You think it's funny, what you
put that family through?No.

36:04.987 --> 36:07.643
I'm just happy that's
who you're working for.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.168
It means no one will be looking
when you both go missing.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.041
Find a hole. Bury them.

36:14.083 --> 36:16.478
Make sure it can't be
traced back to us.

36:16.521 --> 36:18.132
[chuckles]

36:18.175 --> 36:20.134
You really are clumsy.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.224
Move. Both of you.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.139
Got any ideas?No. You?

36:25.182 --> 36:26.532
No.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.534
[grunts]

36:29.403 --> 36:30.840
Y'all miss me?

36:31.797 --> 36:33.668
[clamoring, groaning nearby]

36:33.713 --> 36:35.802
[thudding]

36:37.934 --> 36:40.632
[objects clattering]

36:51.338 --> 36:53.907
You know, the funny thing is,

36:53.949 --> 36:56.300
you could have avoided
all of this

36:56.344 --> 36:59.128
if you would have just
given back their painting

36:59.172 --> 37:00.478
when they asked.

37:00.521 --> 37:02.829
But that's not how
your family does things, is it?

37:02.871 --> 37:04.918
You'll never get
away with this.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.184
[dialing]

37:10.228 --> 37:13.753
Yes, I'd like to report a fire
at the Nardoni residence.

37:13.795 --> 37:15.188
Wait, what are you doing?

37:16.016 --> 37:20.019
Your ancestors burned another
family's life to the ground.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.023
You need to know how that feels.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.244
You're gonna kill me
over a painting?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.246
Well, we're not gonna
burn you alive.

37:29.637 --> 37:30.987
I'm pretty good with knots.

37:31.030 --> 37:32.554
Should take you about
five minutes

37:32.597 --> 37:34.034
to wiggle out of those.

37:35.905 --> 37:39.081
But by that time,
the fire will have spread,

37:39.126 --> 37:40.735
and you won't be able
to stop it.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.302
And if you decide
to wake your men,

37:42.347 --> 37:45.697
you should have, like,
ten minutes to get this art

37:45.740 --> 37:48.309
off the wall. That
should be enough time.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.831
And you can watch

37:49.876 --> 37:52.052
as the rest of your house burns,

37:52.094 --> 37:54.315
right along with all
your prized possessions.

37:54.358 --> 37:56.012
But that's okay.

37:56.056 --> 37:59.059
Because they never really
belonged to you anyway.

37:59.101 --> 38:00.887
NARDONI:
No, wait, please.

38:00.929 --> 38:03.324
Please. I-I'll pay you!

38:03.367 --> 38:05.326
I'll pay you.
[grunts]

38:05.369 --> 38:06.849
No!

38:06.893 --> 38:09.635
Please.Don't take it.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.463
Can't leave the Basquiat.

38:12.507 --> 38:13.681
Good point.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.728
[Nardoni grunting]

38:18.512 --> 38:19.644
"Thanks for saving us, Jessie."

38:19.688 --> 38:21.342
Oh, you're so very welcome,
Robbie.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.952
Oh, no, really, we would have
all been dead

38:23.996 --> 38:25.172
if you hadn't shown up.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.434
I get it now.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.393
Trust me, that's not even
the half of it.

38:28.436 --> 38:29.655
How'd you find us, anyway?

38:29.697 --> 38:31.744
You got your ways,
I got mine.

38:31.786 --> 38:34.050
But here's what matters most.

38:34.094 --> 38:38.228
Everything turned out fine,
just like I said it would.

38:38.271 --> 38:39.708
For you, maybe.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.057
But the Watkins family still
doesn't have their painting.

38:42.101 --> 38:44.190
And Nardoni still has
his billions.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.106
Without that proof,
he'll get away with

38:46.148 --> 38:48.456
dumping toxic waste
into third-world nations.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.416
Yeah... about that.

39:22.315 --> 39:24.056
REPORTER:
In a joint investigation

39:24.099 --> 39:26.059
with the NYPD, the FBI

39:26.101 --> 39:28.103
arrested shipping magnate
Roger Nardoni today

39:28.148 --> 39:30.324
on multiple charges
of money laundering and bribery

39:30.367 --> 39:32.978
in a scheme involving
the illegal shipment

39:33.021 --> 39:34.414
of toxic waste.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.635
This arrest comes just after
Mr. Nardoni's home

39:36.677 --> 39:38.463
was struck by
a mysterious fire.

39:38.505 --> 39:41.813
See? Happy ending.

39:41.856 --> 39:45.425
I told you.
You worry too much.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.342
Only one thing I don't get.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.865
You've never risked your neck
for anyone

39:50.909 --> 39:52.911
unless you were getting paid.

39:52.954 --> 39:54.391
Why'd you come back for me?

39:54.434 --> 39:57.568
Please. I didn't
come back for you.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.222
I came back for that Basquiat.

40:01.007 --> 40:04.313
Right. The Basquiat.

40:04.358 --> 40:07.666
Well, I gotta admit,

40:07.708 --> 40:10.233
you got the job done.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.800
Aha!

40:12.887 --> 40:15.021
So you admit that
you were wrong.

40:15.063 --> 40:16.978
Go ahead, say it!

40:17.023 --> 40:21.201
Different doesn't
make deficient.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.724
We just got two different
styles, that's all.

40:23.768 --> 40:25.771
Yeah, I see it now.

40:25.813 --> 40:27.815
You make chaos work for you.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.643
It shows the cracks,

40:29.688 --> 40:31.385
so you can take advantage
of them.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.213
Exactly.

40:34.213 --> 40:36.389
And if I'm gonna be honest...

40:38.043 --> 40:39.827
...there is something to having

40:39.871 --> 40:43.440
a well-thought-out plan, too.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.748
I guess.[laughs]

40:47.922 --> 40:50.490
Well, all that matters

40:50.534 --> 40:53.798
is we got that painting back.

40:54.929 --> 40:59.326
Which means this little
joint venture of ours

40:59.369 --> 41:00.719
is officially over,

41:00.762 --> 41:04.766
and we never have to
work with each other again.

41:04.809 --> 41:06.724
[laughs]

41:06.768 --> 41:08.509
Never say never.

41:11.512 --> 41:15.123
You know this mission
ain't over, right?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.344
Shall we?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.789
â™ª I see skies of blue

41:28.833 --> 41:32.489
â™ª And clouds of white

41:33.969 --> 41:35.623
Grandmother Ella,

41:35.666 --> 41:38.320
we have something to show you.

41:40.148 --> 41:42.978
â™ª And the dark, sacred night

41:44.675 --> 41:48.896
â™ª And I think to myself

41:52.465 --> 41:53.858
Mama.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.905
â™ª What a wonderful world

42:01.083 --> 42:04.434
Grandmother, look.

42:13.661 --> 42:17.012
â™ª What a wonderful world

42:19.101 --> 42:23.061
â™ª What a wonderful world.
