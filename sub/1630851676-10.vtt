they couldn't find it.

how to hide their assets.

all inherited from his family.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.591
And all stolen
from someone else's.

leaves a legacy.

06:59.896 --> 07:01.202
Just like wealth.

07:01.245 --> 07:03.031
Gets passed down
through the generations.

07:12.213 --> 07:14.216
Cops may have tipped him
before the search

07:14.259 --> 07:15.608
so he could hide the painting.

07:15.651 --> 07:17.437
It's been long enough,
maybe he put it back.

break into his house?

07:19.569 --> 07:22.658

Not as impressive
as your art collection.

quite the eclectic taste.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.593
At least, to my untrained eye.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.725
It's true. My taste
spans the globe,

07:45.769 --> 07:46.944

out of Taiwan?

07:48.336 --> 07:49.817

07:49.860 --> 07:52.341

had a contract with Maersk.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.778
We do. And we're not happy.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.040
But we want

08:10.793 --> 08:12.927
1916? Really?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.449
The colors are vibrant.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.582
No cracking at all.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.499
It almost looks new.

08:20.324 --> 08:23.327
Well, like you said,
your eye is untrained.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.894
A-About your order.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.853
What kind of time frame
are you thinking about?

08:26.896 --> 08:29.596
As soon as possible
once we see numbers

08:29.639 --> 08:30.858

08:30.901 --> 08:33.163
Mr. Toshigi
would like bids by Friday.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.297
And if word leaks,

08:35.340 --> 08:36.645
you're out.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.386
But don't worry.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.692
From what I've seen,

08:39.735 --> 08:41.738
I have a feeling
we'll be talking again soon.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.219
It's the same frame,
but the painting is new.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.394
Designed to match
what's in the magazine.

08:46.437 --> 08:47.657
And when I asked Nardoni

08:47.701 --> 08:49.441
about it, his face lit up
with micro-tells.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.921
MEL:
He must've gotten spooked

08:50.965 --> 08:52.226
by the Watkins family inquiry.

08:52.269 --> 08:53.923
Swapped it out
to maintain deniability.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.447
He has it.

08:55.490 --> 08:57.927
Or he had it.
Question is where is it now?

08:57.971 --> 09:01.062
I think I might know.
Ever heard of The Vault?

09:01.105 --> 09:02.323
The warehouse in Brooklyn?

09:02.366 --> 09:04.152
That's a free port, right?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.023
A free port?It's a free trade zone.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.328
Mostly used to store goods

09:07.371 --> 09:08.591
in transit to avoid customs,

09:08.634 --> 09:10.461
but billionaires like to keep

09:10.505 --> 09:12.333
their art there because,
technically, it's considered

09:12.376 --> 09:13.769
outside the country,
so, you know,

09:13.813 --> 09:15.597
they don't have
to pay duties and taxes on it.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.338
And that's legal?HARRY:
It's one of a thousand loopholes

09:17.381 --> 09:18.948
these guys like to exploit.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.081
The day before the cops

09:20.124 --> 09:21.604
raided Nardoni's place, right,

09:21.648 --> 09:24.563
he moved a bunch of items
from his place to the free port.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.349
And I think the Watkins family
portrait might be one of them.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.307
So, how do I get in?You don't.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.491
Got it.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.755
Oh! I'm so sorry.[chuckles]

18:24.798 --> 18:27.845
Are you okay, miss?Yeah. It's totally my fault.

18:27.888 --> 18:29.499
My mother always said
I was clumsy.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.153
DECKER:
You make clumsy look good.

18:31.196 --> 18:34.113
[gasps]
Wow. That is a nice watch.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.679
DECKER:
Ah, thank you.

18:35.722 --> 18:36.767
It's a classic.Oh.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.682
1917 caged trench watch from...

18:39.727 --> 18:40.944
World War I?

18:40.989 --> 18:43.164
It's exquisite.Ah. Fellow horophile?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.905
Sure. Yeah.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.864
Then you'll appreciate
that I'm the second person

18:46.907 --> 18:48.344
to own this piece.[Mel gasps]

18:48.387 --> 18:50.302
Okay, great. You're doing great,
honey. I just need

18:50.346 --> 18:52.347
an "ow" and a "zzz."

18:52.392 --> 18:54.262
Is that right?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.786
Yes. The original owner

18:55.829 --> 18:58.441
was a quirky Brit.
A military man.

18:58.484 --> 18:59.528
Hmm.HARRY: Mention

18:59.573 --> 19:01.704
the Anglo-Zanzibar War.

19:01.749 --> 19:05.230
He must have fought
in the Anglo-Manzibar War.[chuckles]

19:05.273 --> 19:10.060
You mean the Anglo-Zanzibar War.MEL:
Yes.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.366
DECKER:
Did you know that was actually

19:11.411 --> 19:13.152
the shortest recorded
war in history?

19:13.194 --> 19:14.457
Really?Good, good, good.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.806
I still just need an "ow."

19:15.849 --> 19:17.634
Um, "cow,"

19:17.678 --> 19:19.722
"thou," "plow."Hmm.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.071
[stomps]Ow!

19:21.115 --> 19:23.074
MEL:
I am so sorry.That'll do.

19:23.117 --> 19:25.032
I told you, I'm clumsy.
[chuckles]

19:25.076 --> 19:26.903
You know what,
I'm gonna give you some space.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.124
Okay. Did you get that?

19:29.167 --> 19:32.126
Loud and clear. Just gonna
put it together. Meanwhile...

19:32.171 --> 19:34.738
I know. I better get changed.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.056
Delivery for Roger Nardoni.

19:48.098 --> 19:51.538
Nothing's scheduled for today.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.931
Seriously? They said that
they were gonna call you.

19:53.974 --> 19:57.500
Can you please check?[phone ringing]

19:57.544 --> 19:58.980
Hold on a sec.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.115
[ringing continues]Yep?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.465
DECKER'S VOICE:
This is James Decker

20:06.509 --> 20:09.469
calling in a delivery
for Roger Nardoni.

20:09.511 --> 20:11.992
Single crate. A sculpture.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.998
Thank you, Mr. Decker.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.306
You're clear.Thanks.

20:30.184 --> 20:33.188
Hey, hold on a sec. Stop.[brakes screech]

20:37.018 --> 20:38.714
You're riding low
on your left rear.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.368
You might want to
get some air.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.067
Will do.
Appreciate it.

20:51.858 --> 20:53.861
[wood creaking]

21:02.042 --> 21:03.913
I can't believe
you brought snacks.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.699
You don't want to know me
when I'm hungry.

21:05.741 --> 21:07.221
I'm not sure I want to
know you now.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.484
Don't forget,
I'm doing youa favor.

21:09.528 --> 21:11.226
Bishop should have
never recruited you

21:11.269 --> 21:12.705
from that prison in Marseille.

21:12.749 --> 21:16.012
I would have escaped anyway.
Ooh.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.189
Just so you know,
this ain't Nardoni's vault.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.671
Harry, where the hell are we?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.325
Remember that path

21:23.368 --> 21:26.109
we meticulously planned from
Nardoni's vault to the exit?

21:26.153 --> 21:27.328
You're nowhere near it.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.416
Looks like you're in
some sort of

21:28.461 --> 21:29.722
secure holding room

21:29.766 --> 21:30.854
on the opposite side
of the facility

21:30.897 --> 21:31.898
with God knows what in between.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.727
In other words, we're screwed.

21:33.769 --> 21:35.468
That's about right.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.955
Harry?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.219
Harry, can you hear me?

21:48.262 --> 21:50.787
Concrete's blocking
the signal.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.484
Let's go.
No.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.009
We don't know if he has
control of the cameras yet.

21:55.051 --> 21:57.403
There's only one way
to find out.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.144
[whispering]:
What are you doing?

22:05.888 --> 22:08.718
You hear any sirens? No.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.329
We're fine.No, we're not fine.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.505
He has the map.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.983
We don't know where we're going.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.160
I learned early in this world

22:16.203 --> 22:18.162
you can only depend on yourself.

22:18.205 --> 22:21.470
I memorized those blueprints.
It's this way.

22:23.906 --> 22:25.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.609
Actually, it's this way.

22:30.653 --> 22:34.221
I'm thinking about the-the
blueprints upside down.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.009
Wait, wait, wait!
What?

22:40.054 --> 22:42.185
You see those sconces?

22:42.230 --> 22:44.840
They are next-gen
motion detectors.

22:44.884 --> 22:45.885
Had 'em in the Louvre.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.539
You so much as bat an eyelash

22:47.583 --> 22:49.063
and you set them off.

22:49.105 --> 22:51.152
How do we get past them?

22:51.194 --> 22:54.721
Well, it just depends if they
updated the software.

22:54.763 --> 22:57.157
If it's new firmware, we won't.

22:57.201 --> 23:00.422
But if the firmware is old...

23:01.989 --> 23:03.990
What are you doing?

23:07.385 --> 23:11.040
Too many data points overwhelmed
the old software.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.565
It's logged in as an error.

23:12.607 --> 23:14.305
And then the system
just reboots itself.

23:14.348 --> 23:16.568
Wait for it.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.614
Five, four,

23:18.657 --> 23:21.311
three, two...

23:21.355 --> 23:22.575
Yes!

23:22.617 --> 23:24.315
The system just rebooted itself.

23:24.358 --> 23:27.275
We got 15 seconds.
Race you.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.632
Damn, Robbie,
you getting slow.

23:36.675 --> 23:39.329
Keep it up, you gonna
get us caught.What the hell, Jess?

23:39.374 --> 23:41.723
Next time, tell me
before you take off.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.422
Oh, here you go.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.901
You know, it's just like China.

23:44.944 --> 23:47.034
It's not you, it's me.
You know what?

23:47.076 --> 23:48.775
It's not my fault
if you can't keep up.

23:48.817 --> 23:50.124
Girl, I'm gonna hurt you.

23:50.166 --> 23:52.125
Did I not just
get us to the door

23:52.169 --> 23:53.605
of the stairwell?

23:53.648 --> 23:57.131
Is Nardoni's unit not upstairs
and down the hall?

23:57.173 --> 23:59.480
I would think you would
stop criticizing me

23:59.525 --> 24:02.657
and just be a little bit
more impressed.

24:02.701 --> 24:05.182
Just open the door.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.142
What?

24:10.536 --> 24:11.450
I need a key card.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.321
No. You cannot need
a key card.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.105
Because you said you would
get a key card.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.499
You said it'd be easy to get.

24:17.542 --> 24:18.979
Okay, so my source
didn't come through.

24:19.021 --> 24:20.414
So I'm gonna improv.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.721
I'm gonna improv!Improv? No, no, no, no.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.505
I hate your improv.

24:33.732 --> 24:36.561
Yeah, except now we have
an unconscious guard.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.652
It's cool. Just tie his ass up
and throw him in there.

24:39.694 --> 24:42.132
If you would have gotten
a card beforehand,

24:42.175 --> 24:43.612
we could have been
in and out of here

24:43.655 --> 24:44.874
without anyone ever knowing.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.528
Every good plan needs
a little improv.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.269
You know, like jazz.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.707
Jazz my ass.
Now we're on the clock.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.143
What if he wakes up?

24:53.186 --> 24:55.144
What if he manages to get help?

24:55.189 --> 24:57.670
Well, we can always kill him.

24:57.712 --> 25:00.063
We don't have to worry
about him waking up then.

25:00.106 --> 25:01.238
Would that make you happy?

25:01.281 --> 25:04.372
No. But shooting you would.

25:04.414 --> 25:06.895
I said I would get a card,

25:06.940 --> 25:08.855
and I got a card.

25:08.897 --> 25:11.683
Show a little gratitude.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.685
Just a teeny, teeny bit.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.557
[lock beeps]

25:16.731 --> 25:18.211
All right.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.257
This is the floor
I was talking about.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.954
Random pressure plates.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.391
Now, all the tiles
look the same,

25:23.433 --> 25:25.914
but if you step on the
wrong one, party over.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.875
And you memorized it?Yes.

25:28.917 --> 25:32.226
From a guy you were
drinking with.Yes.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.880
How many years ago?Three.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.230
How much ouzo?

25:36.272 --> 25:40.407
Now, why would I do anything
to jeopardize me?

25:41.278 --> 25:45.239
Just take every step
that I take.

25:50.896 --> 25:53.115
Whoa!

25:54.290 --> 25:57.032
Is it here, or is it there?
[chuckles]

25:57.076 --> 25:59.122
Relax. Have some fun.

25:59.165 --> 26:01.211
Remember that night in Macao

26:01.255 --> 26:02.385
with the tiger
and the motorcycle?

26:02.430 --> 26:05.432

That was fun.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.740
Yeah. And we got the
access codes, right?

26:07.782 --> 26:09.523
So just chill, I got you.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.657

right down there.

What?

26:17.750 --> 26:18.968
Wait. Wait.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.143
I didn't see
where you stepped.

26:20.186 --> 26:22.667
I know.What are you doing?

26:24.365 --> 26:27.367
You know I didn't just
come here for that painting.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.760
This'll only take a minute.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.285
No. Get back here.
This is not our mission.

Back soon. Don't move.

I could have

Sells this other piece over here

a well-thought-out plan, too.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.748
I guess.[laughs]

40:47.922 --> 40:50.490
Well, all that matters

40:50.534 --> 40:53.798
is we got that painting back.

40:54.929 --> 40:59.326
Which means this little
joint venture of ours

40:59.369 --> 41:00.719
is officially over,

41:00.762 --> 41:04.766
and we never have to
work with each other again.

41:04.809 --> 41:06.724
[laughs]

41:06.768 --> 41:08.509
Never say never.

41:11.512 --> 41:15.123
You know this mission
ain't over, right?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.344
Shall we?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.789
♪ I see skies of blue

41:28.833 --> 41:32.489
♪ And clouds of white

41:33.969 --> 41:35.623
Grandmother Ella,

41:35.666 --> 41:38.320
we have something to show you.

41:40.148 --> 41:42.978
♪ And the dark, sacred night

41:44.675 --> 41:48.896
♪ And I think to myself

41:52.465 --> 41:53.858
Mama.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.905
♪ What a wonderful world

42:01.083 --> 42:04.434
Grandmother, look.

42:13.661 --> 42:17.012
♪ What a wonderful world

42:19.101 --> 42:23.061
♪ What a wonderful world.
