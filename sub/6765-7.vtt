WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:08.299
{\an3}Oh, man, can you believe
this turnout tonight?

00:08.383 --> 00:09.426
Of course I can.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.637
{\an1}This is my dream,
my vision, my party!

00:12.721 --> 00:15.056
{\an5}Well, I thought
Dylan was supposed
to be on duty.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.267
{\an4}Well, he is, but
he probably got some
hot date or something.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.269
{\an1}Probably with
a bottle of tequila.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.272
{\an1}It's okay, the way
I've got this place wired,

00:22.355 --> 00:23.940
{\an1}it'll practically
run itself. Hey, man.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.150
{\an3}Yeah, well, I got
to hand it to you, Steve.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.111
I didn't think you
could pull it off.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.780
{\an4}Everybody doubted me.
Everybody except Valerie.
Hey, baby.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.615
{\an3}Hey!

00:32.698 --> 00:34.242
{\an3}Yeah, she's
a good one.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.577
{\an1}I'll say.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.620
I'm taking it real slow.
Playing it real low-key.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.413
Well, it seems
to be working.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.957
{\an1}Yeah, everything's
working for me.

00:41.040 --> 00:41.791
I'm hot, hot-hot-hot!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.251
{\an1}Don't touch me,
you'll burn yourself.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.461
{\an3}Come on.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.296
{\an1}All right, yeah, hey,
have a great time.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.298
Howdy.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.799
{\an1}Howdy.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.176
I'd like to speak
to the owners, please.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.302
{\an1}I'm sorry,
they're not around.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.303
Is there something
I can do for you?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.304
Are you in charge?

00:54.387 --> 00:55.305
Absolutely.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.308
Then this is for you.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.726
What's this?

00:59.809 --> 01:00.602
Fire Marshal.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.854
{\an3}You'll have to shut down
and move out.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.522
{\an1}What?!

01:05.607 --> 01:08.818
Maximum capacity's
150 people.

01:08.902 --> 01:13.031
{\an3}We got these laws
for a reason, fella.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.325
I heard about these laws.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.327
I'm sure you're not trying
to bribe a County official.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.288
No.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.499
I hoped you'd say that.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.502
All right, kiddies,

01:25.585 --> 01:26.586
the party's over!

01:29.756 --> 01:31.049
{\an3}Already?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.283
{\an5}STEVE:
<i>Come on, Bussichio. I told you</i>
<i>I'd pay the fine.</i>

02:38.366 --> 02:39.450
That's not the point, Steve.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.369
Having an after-hours club
is a good idea,

02:41.452 --> 02:42.412
but it's not right
for the Peach Pit.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.248
{\an1}Not right?
Do you have any idea

02:45.331 --> 02:46.583
how much money we cleared

02:46.666 --> 02:48.459
before Fire Marshal Bill
decided to fill his quota?

02:48.543 --> 02:49.586
Quota, shmota.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.421
I can't afford
to shut down again.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.090
And we can't afford to walk away
from the Peach Pit After Dark.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.300
I'm telling you, not with the
word of mouth we have going!

02:55.383 --> 02:57.468
{\an3}Guys,

02:57.552 --> 02:58.928
why don't we charge
twice as much

02:59.012 --> 03:00.096
and let in half as many people?

03:00.179 --> 03:01.306
Or better yet,

03:01.389 --> 03:02.432
why don't you just get
a bigger place?

03:02.515 --> 03:03.808
Then we could have live music.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.101
Wait a minute.
Are you saying

03:05.184 --> 03:06.394
{\an1}move the Peach Pit?
Are you out of your minds?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.937
Well, you don't
have to move it.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.231
{\an3}The rug store next door
is going out of business.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.941
Nakoom? Hah! He's been
going out of business

03:12.025 --> 03:12.942
the last five years.

03:13.026 --> 03:13.943
I bet we can

03:14.027 --> 03:14.986
get a lease dirt cheap.

03:15.069 --> 03:15.862
Who can afford the lease

03:15.945 --> 03:17.780
when I can't even afford
to pay the fine?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.115
Well, what about
your silent partner?

03:19.198 --> 03:20.533
What about him?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.994
Well, all I keep hearing is
what a moneybags Dylan McKay is.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.621
And Steve says

03:24.704 --> 03:27.206
he never refuses you anything.

04:29.936 --> 04:30.853
Ray, hi.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.063
{\an3}Hi.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.399
I, uh, I just came by
to bring you something.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.359
Oh, it's so cute!

04:36.442 --> 04:37.652
A baby pumpkin!

04:37.735 --> 04:40.238
{\an3}And...

04:40.321 --> 04:43.408
Oh, my God! It's huge!

04:43.491 --> 04:44.534
{\an3}This is the biggest one
of the season

04:44.617 --> 04:46.369
and that's the smallest.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.537
{\an3}So, it's kind
of an unmatched set.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.415
Well, thank you.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.208
That was very nice of you.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.335
So, uh, if you're not busy
tonight,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.671
maybe we could hang out and
decorate 'em or something.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.380
Okay, great.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.924
{\an1}Donna,
you're not gonna

05:00.008 --> 05:02.218
believe this.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.886
{\an1}Hello, Ray.
Hi.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.346
Look what Ray brought us.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.431
The tiniest pumpkin
on the lot, and...

05:06.514 --> 05:08.850
{\an1}the pumpkin that ate
Santa Monica.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.560
How big of him.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.068
So, uh, I'm gonna go.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.570
Okay, well, uh, about tonight?
What time?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.697
Um, I don't know.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
I might have to work,
so I'll call you later.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.367
Okay.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.452
{\an3}See ya.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.245
Bye. Thank you.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.205
Listen, if Andrea calls,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.207
{\an3}tell her there's
been a change of plans

05:33.291 --> 05:35.168
{\an3}and she should meet me
here in an hour.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.377
Bring the baby.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.129
Okay, but if she's coming here,
why are you leaving?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.213
I have to pick up Erin.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.381
Jackie had some
scheduling problems,

05:40.465 --> 05:42.592
which is short for saying
"quality time with Mommy has

05:42.675 --> 05:43.551
to wait till Mommy's had
her manicure."

05:43.634 --> 05:46.095
{\an1}Wait!

05:46.179 --> 05:47.555
{\an1}Are Mr. and Mrs. Walsh still
going to Palm Springs tonight?

05:47.638 --> 05:50.516
Yes, they are, and I'm going
to be staying there

05:50.600 --> 05:52.602
so you can tell Mr. Ray
that I won't be bothering you.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.271
{\an3}Although, what you
see in him...

05:55.354 --> 05:55.772
{\an1}You were just leaving,
weren't you?

05:55.855 --> 05:56.564
{\an3}(chuckles):
Yes.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.400
Thought so.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.240
{\an1}(Middle-Eastern accent):
Right this way, my friend.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.408
{\an1}I'm about to blow
your mind.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.285
{\an3}A little early for that,
isn't it, Steve?

06:09.368 --> 06:09.994
{\an1}Come on. Come on.
It's over here.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.163
Can we get a cup
of coffee first?

06:12.246 --> 06:14.332
First things first.
You gotta check this place out.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.917
{\an1}I'm telling you
it couldn't be more perfect.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.542
{\an1}Habib, how are the women
treating you?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.296
<i>Al Nakoom,</i>

06:20.379 --> 06:22.131
this is Dylan McKay.

06:22.215 --> 06:22.632
{\an3}It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.926
The pleasure's ours.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.137
Uh, Mr. Nakoom, could I have a
second with these guys, please?

06:28.221 --> 06:28.679
{\an3}Certainly.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.641
Nat, what's going on?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.684
The Fire Marshal shut down
our after-hours club last night

06:33.768 --> 06:35.520
for exceeding
our capacity.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.272
Penalized for being
popular, huh?

06:38.356 --> 06:41.109
Exactly!
The club is a cash cow, man.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.318
{\an1}But instead
of selling the farm,

06:42.401 --> 06:44.612
{\an6}we're gonna milk it
for all it's worth
and expand here.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.489
{\an3}We don't even have
to knock down any walls.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.282
Well, no major walls.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.618
You guys want to buy
Nakoom's rug store?

06:50.701 --> 06:51.744
Not buy it, lease it.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.538
For three one-year options.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.498
{\an1}Four months, we'll make
our investment back.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.500
The rest is gravy.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.709
It could be
a gold mine.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.877
People need a place to go.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.170
It'd fill a void.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.130
It's money in the bank.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.174
{\an1}What are you two,
surround sound?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
{\an1}D, I don't wanna
pressure you.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.137
{\an1}Take your time
and think about it.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.847
{\an3}But don't think about it
too long, please.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.141
I absolutely need a tenant.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.684
This time, we are really going

07:14.767 --> 07:16.394
out of business.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.020
I don't need to think about it.

07:18.104 --> 07:18.688
{\an3}These guys say
it's a gold mine.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.524
I said that.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.650
Mm.

07:22.733 --> 07:23.901
NAT:
I think it's a good idea, Dylan.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.945
{\an1}This may finally get
the Peach Pit out of the red.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.488
How much?

07:27.572 --> 07:30.074
{\an3}The whole shebang:
remodeling,

07:30.158 --> 07:33.411
closing costs, permits,
a measly 150,000 bucks.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.038
$150,000, Steve?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.165
More or less.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.249
Possibly more.

07:38.332 --> 07:38.666
Probably less.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.006
It's a deal...

07:45.089 --> 07:47.717
on one condition:
I gotta have a cup of coffee.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.718
{\an1}(laughs)

07:48.801 --> 07:50.636
Coffee, please.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.388
I'm buying for everybody.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.764
Okay, Mel is going
to pick Erin up

07:53.848 --> 07:56.058
at your place right after lunch.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.226
{\an3}He better be
on time for once.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.062
{\an5}Well, I could drop her
back by if you want.
No-no-no.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.106
He has specific instructions
about her nap and everything.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.900
Where are my shoes?!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.735
Mom, what's your
portfolio doing out?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.528
Do you see my eyelash curler?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.738
Would you stop for one second
and talk to me, please?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.199
Honey, I am just so crazed.

08:11.282 --> 08:11.616
About a manicure?

08:11.699 --> 08:14.911
No, I'm working.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.330
Beekman Mills is doing
a "Fabulous at Forty" campaign

08:17.413 --> 08:18.623
to promote their new
cosmetic line, and they want me.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.083
{\an3}And Claude is
doing the shoot,

08:21.167 --> 08:22.752
but he has to leave town Monday,
so it has to be tonight.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.921
I can't believe
you're modeling again.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.006
Kelly, do not start.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.007
Only if you promise me

08:28.090 --> 08:29.592
that this isn't going to
be a regular occurrence.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.719
Are you willing to pay my bills?
Because they

08:31.802 --> 08:33.261
{\an1}are a very regular
occurrence.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.931
Mom, you know how
bad it is for you.

08:35.014 --> 08:35.890
It's not worth it
in the long run.

08:35.972 --> 08:38.976
Please, I may truly be
"Fabulous at Forty,"

08:39.059 --> 08:40.895
but I am only a novelty act.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.938
{\an1}If there is ever a big
demand for my age bracket,

08:43.022 --> 08:44.065
then we can discuss this.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.983
But for now,
it's a one-shot deal.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.110
And I, for one,
would really like to feel

08:48.194 --> 08:49.904
like I'm not completely
over the hill. Okay?

08:49.987 --> 08:51.697
Okay.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.243
Good-bye, baby.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.998
Oh, good-bye, baby.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.672
JIM (a la Ricky Ricardo):
<i>Lucy, I'm home!</i>

09:07.755 --> 09:09.632
Good timing.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.425
{\an3}I just got back
from Dr. Tisherman's.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.927
{\an3}And?
(liquid pouring)

09:13.010 --> 09:14.136
{\an3}He gave us
the green light.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.471
Which means?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.849
It means we go
"have fun the old-fashioned way"

09:18.933 --> 09:21.102
and, uh, we go back
in six months

09:21.185 --> 09:22.520
if we have nothing
to show for it.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.689
Well, Mrs. Walsh,
I can't think of anyone else

09:24.772 --> 09:26.315
I'd rather make a baby with.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.820
(clears throat)

09:30.903 --> 09:33.447
Hey! Oh, hi guys.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.824
{\an5}(chuckles):
Didn't see you
making out over there.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.659
Don't stop on our account.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.868
We wouldn't want you
to beat the traffic

09:37.952 --> 09:40.830
{\an3}to Palm Springs or
anything silly like that.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.039
Brandon, relax.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.166
Uh, maybe we better
put the bags in the car?

09:44.250 --> 09:44.834
Yeah, I just have
to wait for one fax.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.461
(groans):
You see?

09:47.545 --> 09:48.337
I told you it was a mistake

09:48.421 --> 09:50.172
to bring that machine
into our home.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.009
I just have to sign it
and send it right back.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.136
(fax beeping)

10:04.687 --> 10:05.896
BRANDON:
<i>I don't get it, Dad.</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:06.897
I thought you stopped handling

10:06.981 --> 10:07.898
Dylan's finances
a long time ago.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.901
I did, but until Dylan
completes the paperwork,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.654
I still have to sign off on any
transaction involving his house.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.823
So if this is just a formality,
why don't you sign

10:15.906 --> 10:17.742
the piece of paper
and let us get on the road?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.535
Because it's bugging me.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.911
I mean, with all his assets,

10:20.995 --> 10:23.247
why would Dylan take an equity
line out on his house?

10:23.331 --> 10:24.498
{\an1}BRANDON:
Maybe because he's spending

10:24.582 --> 10:25.750
{\an1}his money like
there's no tomorrow.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.043
Is he still bitter
about you and Kelly?

10:27.126 --> 10:29.503
It wouldn't surprise me.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.589
But I hear he's
with a different girl

10:31.672 --> 10:34.050
pretty much
every night.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.718
It just doesn't make any sense.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.761
I mean, you don't
want to take out a mortgage

10:36.844 --> 10:39.221
on your home
unless you really have to.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.890
Then obviously he has to.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.851
Valerie, Dylan's a millionaire.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.895
No, he's not.

10:45.978 --> 10:46.896
Not anymore.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.022
How do you know?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.775
I just know, okay?

10:50.858 --> 10:54.695
The truth is, Dylan's broke.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.954
(doorbell rings)

11:06.040 --> 11:09.043
{\an3}Erin, ask who it is first.
(door opens)

11:09.126 --> 11:10.002
MEL:
Hi, darlin'!

11:10.086 --> 11:12.713
{\an1}Hi!
Hi, darlin'!

11:12.797 --> 11:13.506
{\an1}Come here.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.760
{\an1}Erin, you must never
do that again.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.762
Don't worry, Kelly.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.764
She knows me by my scent.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.932
(giggling)

11:23.015 --> 11:24.809
How's it going?

11:24.892 --> 11:27.520
{\an1}Erin's fine;
Jackie's another story.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.064
Go ahead.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.819
Here I was hoping you would
tell me not to be concerned.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.779
{\an1}Why would you
be concerned, Mel?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.656
{\an3}(chuckles softly):
Didn't you once tell me

11:38.739 --> 11:41.784
that you felt that all the
modeling you did as a kid

11:41.867 --> 11:45.788
{\an3}warped your... body image
and damaged your self-esteem?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.958
{\an1}Since when are you so worried
about Jackie's self-esteem?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.836
I was talking about Erin.

11:51.919 --> 11:52.962
Why?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.130
Erin, Jackie,

11:54.213 --> 11:55.464
Claude...

11:55.548 --> 11:57.341
the mother-daughter photo shoot?

11:57.425 --> 11:57.842
Mother-daughter photo shoot?

11:57.925 --> 11:58.843
You didn't know?

11:58.926 --> 12:01.971
No, can't say that I did.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.101
{\an5}CINDY:
<i>I am sorry,</i>
<i>but that little girl</i>

12:07.184 --> 12:08.936
who idolized Dylan
and loved him like a brother

12:09.019 --> 12:11.313
was not a con artist.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.314
No, maybe not Erica,
but I wouldn't

12:12.398 --> 12:14.275
{\an6}put it past her mother.
Neither
would I.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.985
{\an6}JIM:
Remember when I
found 20 grand

12:16.068 --> 12:17.153
in Suzanne's
bank account

12:17.236 --> 12:17.987
after she'd told Dylan
she was broke?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.114
That's right,
she said it was from

12:20.197 --> 12:21.115
some insurance
settlement, right?

12:21.198 --> 12:22.658
Yeah, and Dylan bought it,

12:22.741 --> 12:23.993
hook, line and sinker--
with Erica as the bait.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.995
I still can't believe it.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.956
It certainly fits with the way
Dylan's been acting lately.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.958
{\an6}JIM:
I feel really
terrible about this.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.001
To think we came this close

12:32.084 --> 12:35.463
to putting our own money
in the deal.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.132
I better get back
to the office.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.469
Should I call the resort
and say we need a late check-in?

12:41.552 --> 12:44.305
{\an6}I don't think this is
the day to be going
out of town, honey.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.015
Great timing, Val.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.434
I'm sorry, you guys.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.480
{\an5}What were you doing
with Dylan McKay?
Jim.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.815
{\an6}JIM:
We explicitly told you to
stay away from that guy.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.734
I know. I'm sorry.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.402
I shouldn't have said anything.

12:59.778 --> 13:00.738
That's not the point.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.406
Well, why didn't you
say something sooner?

13:02.490 --> 13:02.990
Does anyone else
know about this?

13:03.073 --> 13:04.909
No, I don't think so.

13:04.992 --> 13:08.078
And please,
don't tell him I told you.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.709
We were at the Peach Pit
one night, and Dylan was drunk.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.212
He needed somebody to talk to.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.881
I was there. That's all.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.216
That's all?

13:20.299 --> 13:20.883
Well...

13:20.966 --> 13:23.385
he wanted to kiss me.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.720
{\an1}I told him

13:24.803 --> 13:26.764
that's not what I had in mind.

13:26.847 --> 13:27.765
But he was so drunk,

13:27.848 --> 13:28.933
I don't think
he remembered in the morning.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.773
Please, you have to believe me.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.691
Of course we believe you,
Valerie.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.026
This news is just such a shock.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.071
{\an3}JIM:
I'm sorry, honey.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.865
I'll try not to be
home too late.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.086
(doorbell rings)

13:57.169 --> 13:59.922
Griffin. Hi.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.091
What are you doing here?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.926
Delivering these.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.303
And this.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.975
And hopefully,
sweeping you off your feet.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.393
Metaphorically speaking.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.185
Shall we? Or...

14:13.269 --> 14:15.145
{\an3}perhaps you should
get your wrap.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.398
Uh...

14:17.481 --> 14:21.569
Uh, Donna, uh, sorry,
Griffin called

14:21.652 --> 14:22.611
early this morning--
I forgot to tell you.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.029
He wanted to know what
you were doing tonight.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.114
{\an1}I told him that you were
just gonna hang out

14:25.197 --> 14:26.115
{\an1}and help me put up pictures
and stuff.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.325
Hope that was okay.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.118
Hi, Griffin. How's it going?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.077
Hi.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.789
Oh, my gosh, uh,

14:33.872 --> 14:36.667
you-you want me
to go out with you right now?

14:36.750 --> 14:37.918
What, you don't like
the flowers?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.128
No, no. (laughs)

14:39.211 --> 14:42.298
It's just I...
I sort of made plans.

14:42.381 --> 14:42.965
Cancel them.

14:43.048 --> 14:43.966
Um...

14:44.049 --> 14:45.634
{\an3}You won't regret
it, I swear.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.969
I have the entire
evening planned.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.012
Reservations confirmed--
I have my father's keys,

14:48.095 --> 14:51.432
so we're gonna
be going in style.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.141
{\an3}And the fact is,
I simply

14:52.224 --> 14:54.893
will not take no for an answer.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.147
Have I ever told you
how beautiful you are?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.778
No, but you...
can tell me on the way.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.448
I just... I got to go change.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.790
I've got to remember that "won't
take no for an answer" line.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.001
That was smooth.
Mm, believe me.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.587
{\an3}She is not going
to forget this evening.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.630
(line ringing)

15:22.713 --> 15:24.214
Come on, Ray.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.892
Clare, listen, if Ray calls,
tell him I need

15:34.975 --> 15:35.517
{\an3}to take a rain check, okay?
Mm-hmm.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.436
Don't forget this time.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.646
I'll be gentle.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.147
Okay.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.024
Ready?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.903
{\an1}Do not-- I repeat--
do not wait up.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.154
We'll see you tomorrow.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.703
(line ringing)

15:54.787 --> 15:55.871
Mommy!

15:55.954 --> 15:58.248
Hi, baby cakes!

15:58.332 --> 16:00.542
{\an3}I was beginning
to wonder where you were.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.919
Where's your daddy?

16:02.002 --> 16:03.879
I don't know.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.339
Her father sent me instead.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.215
Kelly, what are
you doing here?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.550
I should ask you the same thing.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.343
Didn't we go through this?

16:09.426 --> 16:12.221
{\an1}No. You left out
the part where Erin

16:12.304 --> 16:14.056
{\an1}gets to follow
in my illustrious footsteps.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.892
Honey, I was in a hurry.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.018
Why are you bringing

16:18.102 --> 16:19.561
a three-year-old
to a night shoot?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.480
I mean, you're messing up her
entire routine, and for what?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.857
How about for a down payment
on her college fund?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.775
{\an3}Or her
orthodontia,

16:24.858 --> 16:26.735
her teen tours,
her car phone...

16:26.819 --> 16:28.862
Why don't you just sell her

16:28.946 --> 16:30.072
into indentured servitude
while you're at it?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.574
Okay, let's just take it
down a notch, here.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.160
I honestly do not see
what you are so upset about.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.245
{\an3}I told you,

16:36.328 --> 16:37.496
{\an3}this is a one-shot deal;
they asked me

16:37.579 --> 16:39.957
to do them a favor at the last
minute, and I feel honored.

16:40.040 --> 16:40.874
It's as simple as that.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.085
{\an3}Now if you are so
afraid that Erin is

16:43.168 --> 16:44.920
{\an3}going to be traumatized
by this experience,

16:45.003 --> 16:47.214
why don't you stick around
and make sure she's okay?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.721
{\an3}All right, I think I will.
Okay.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.597
Fine.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.015
That'll be helpful, actually.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.309
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.271
Oh, come here, you.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.653
And come here, you.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.662
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Griffin, when you said your</i>
<i>father gave you his keys,</i>

17:18.746 --> 17:19.246
<i>I thought you meant to his car.</i>

17:21.540 --> 17:22.790
Just tell me one thing.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.792
{\an1}We're not gonna
parachute down, right?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.296
No, no, we're gonna
land and everything.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.798
{\an3}I just, uh, thought it
might be a little difficult

17:29.882 --> 17:31.508
{\an3}to drive to
Catalina Island.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.302
Oh, don't get me wrong,

17:33.385 --> 17:34.636
I'm not complaining.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.638
This is terrific.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.307
You know, I've always wanted
to do something like this.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.852
I just never met
the right girl to do it with.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.938
So how do you know
I'm the right girl?

17:46.273 --> 17:48.692
{\an3}Because you have the
perfect body temperature

17:48.776 --> 17:50.736
at any elevation.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.035
(doorbell rings)

18:01.538 --> 18:02.372
{\an1}Hi.
Hey.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.666
I bet you're looking for Donna.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.834
Yeah, is she around?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.878
Something came up.
She said she'll call you.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.380
Maybe I could hang around
for a while and wait for her.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.965
No, I don't think so.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.175
I kind of have
a guest myself, so...

18:13.258 --> 18:15.219
No sweat.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.637
I'll just, I'll wait outside.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.847
Ray, babe...

18:18.931 --> 18:20.349
{\an1}listen up.
I hate

18:20.432 --> 18:21.850
to break this to you,
but she's out on a date

18:21.934 --> 18:22.392
so you're going to have
to take a rain check.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.146
You know how it is:

18:26.230 --> 18:28.357
so many men, so little time.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.442
Yeah, thanks a lot, "babe."

18:32.694 --> 18:34.321
Hey. Don't go away mad.

Must you always start
by stating the obvious?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.756
{\an3}Okay, I guess
it's best that, uh,

19:34.840 --> 19:37.551
we cut to the chase.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.638
Look, I've been made aware
of your monetary situation.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.431
What "situation"?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.976
Come on, I just want to talk.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.978
Yeah, but I don't want to talk
to you, and I certainly

19:48.061 --> 19:49.396
don't want to discuss
my monetary situation.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.274
{\an1}You fired me as your
client, remember?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.943
You're not my financial
advisor anymore.

19:55.027 --> 19:55.944
You aren't anything.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.322
Come on, don't be this way.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.406
{\an3}I might be
able to help.

19:59.489 --> 20:00.782
I don't want your help.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.825
Dylan.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.119
{\an3}Look...

20:04.202 --> 20:05.913
when you applied for that
line of credit,

20:05.996 --> 20:09.708
the bank contacted me
and I did some investigating.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.461
{\an3}I'm sorry.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.465
I've been racking my brain

20:16.548 --> 20:17.674
trying to come up
with a solution.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.508
Yeah, well, rest your brains,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.969
'cause there is no solution.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.096
Okay, the money's gone;
it's over.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.306
{\an1}You don't
have any leads

20:24.389 --> 20:25.474
as to where Kevin and Suzanne
might be hiding?

20:25.557 --> 20:28.143
I don't have any leads

20:28.226 --> 20:29.853
as to where Kevin
and Suzanne are hiding.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.146
There, I said it.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.773
{\an3}You happy now?
Dylan,

20:32.856 --> 20:34.816
this doesn't make me happy.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.486
I think it does.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.487
{\an1}I think you
just can't wait

20:38.570 --> 20:40.447
to tell me that
I got everything

20:40.530 --> 20:42.366
I deserved, everything
that was coming to me,

20:42.449 --> 20:43.492
so why don't you
just skip everything else

20:43.575 --> 20:46.870
and say it
and get out of my face.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.498
I'm so glad I canceled a trip

20:49.581 --> 20:52.584
with my wife for this.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.544
Jim...
Talk to you later, Nat.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.256
(door closes)

21:00.884 --> 21:03.178
{\an3}(laughs):
Oh, God...

21:03.261 --> 21:05.013
Your new mission,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.807
if you decide
to accept it,

21:06.890 --> 21:09.226
{\an3}is to stick this entire
piece of watermelon

21:09.309 --> 21:11.478
Not a chance. No, no-no.
in your mouth at one time.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.689
{\an3}Oh...
(giggles)

21:13.772 --> 21:14.523
Please, commander,
no more, please.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.192
I'm not the commander.

21:17.275 --> 21:17.818
I'm the all-knowing
watermelon guru.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.320
Thanks to you, I'm a mess.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.030
Yeah, you are.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.532
Take off your shirt.
I'll throw it in the wash.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.369
{\an3}There's T-shirts
in the bottom drawer

21:27.452 --> 21:29.204
if you're freezing.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.541
Oh, that's disgusting.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.251
{\an3}Can you open the door
for me, please?

21:34.334 --> 21:34.793
Yeah.
Thank you.

21:36.753 --> 21:37.754
I can't believe you.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.630
Bye. (giggles)

22:03.822 --> 22:06.867
{\an1}Now I know why
we get along so well.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.203
That is something
I would have done.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.497
{\an1}In fact, that's
something I <i> have</i> done.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.420
{\an3}Mmm! I hope you don't mind
that I borrowed these.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.422
What do you mean?

22:20.505 --> 22:24.217
{\an3}Well, you said,
"Make yourself at home."

22:24.301 --> 22:27.429
{\an1}David, those
are <i> my</i> handcuffs?

22:27.512 --> 22:28.555
Uh-huh.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.433
I don't have the key.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.935
Yes, you do.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.562
{\an1}This is for
my jewelry box.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.482
{\an1}I lost the handcuff
key when I was...

22:38.565 --> 22:42.110
{\an1}That's
a different story.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.112
Oh, my God!

22:44.196 --> 22:44.780
Oh, great.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.157
{\an3}We better call
a locksmith.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.452
Uh-uh. Not so fast.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.621
{\an1}First, I get
to have my way with you.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.464
(doorbell rings)

23:02.547 --> 23:05.425
Who could that be?

23:05.509 --> 23:06.635
I don't know.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.636
{\an1}It better not
be that Ray guy again.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.138
Don't you move, now.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.431
Very funny.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.648
Man!

23:21.525 --> 23:22.442
Surprise!

23:22.526 --> 23:24.152
Daddy!

23:24.236 --> 23:25.195
{\an1}My dinner
got canceled

23:25.278 --> 23:26.488
at the last minute.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.489
I suddenly realized
I've been so busy

23:27.572 --> 23:29.074
I haven't even seen where
my daughter is living.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.494
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

23:32.577 --> 23:34.538
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.957
Come in. Come in.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.301
{\an6}Oh. Why don't we
go grab a bite?
I'm starved.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.220
{\an1}Great. Just show me
your room, and we'll go.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.888
{\an3}Oh, there's really
nothing to see, Dad.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.681
It's a total mess.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.850
{\an1}Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.687
{\an3}Uh... Let me straighten
up first, okay?

23:58.770 --> 23:59.813
{\an3}The view. Why don't
you look at the view?

23:59.896 --> 24:03.066
{\an6}It's... it's
really beautiful.
It's really special.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.818
Clare, it's dark out.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.529
{\an3}I'm going to go call
the restaurant.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.029
Okay, Dad? Um...

24:08.113 --> 24:09.698
I'll be right back.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.074
Just going to make
some reservations, okay?

24:11.158 --> 24:12.200
Just one second.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.537
What took you so long?

24:15.620 --> 24:16.538
My father is here,
and he's not leaving.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.665
You're kidding. Your father?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.250
I'm going to get expelled!

24:20.333 --> 24:21.751
Hi. Hello.
Is this Marina Lock &amp; Key?

24:21.835 --> 24:22.627
You got it.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.754
Yeah, we have a bit
of an emergency.

24:24.838 --> 24:25.755
Could you come over right away?

24:25.839 --> 24:27.591
{\an1}The address is
1610 Lighthouse Road,

24:27.674 --> 24:30.135
apartment four. Okay?

24:30.218 --> 24:32.679
1610 Lighthouse Road,
apartment four.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.764
{\an1}Yeah. Okay.
Thank you. Bye.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.224
{\an6}Clare, you can't
let him see me.
Lie down.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.393
{\an4}Why?
Shut up
and lie down, okay?

24:38.476 --> 24:38.977
{\an3}Clare, what good is
this going to do?

24:39.060 --> 24:39.728
David, unless you lie

24:39.811 --> 24:42.898
perfectly still,
this may become

24:42.981 --> 24:45.066
a very, very weird scene here.

24:45.150 --> 24:45.650
{\an1}Okay?
But...

24:45.734 --> 24:48.236
{\an1}Shh!

24:48.320 --> 24:49.821
(sighs)

24:52.616 --> 24:53.742
(sighs)

24:53.825 --> 24:56.786
Okay, Dad, come on in.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.748
Okay.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.832
Hi.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.709
Told you it was a mess.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.630
{\an1}At least you've got
some pictures up.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.215
{\an1}(chuckles)

25:11.343 --> 25:12.594
Hey.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.263
{\an3}That was Sun
Valley, wasn't it?

25:15.347 --> 25:18.058
{\an1}Yep, it was,
actually.

25:18.141 --> 25:18.725
Boy, I'm starved, Dad.

25:18.808 --> 25:19.726
{\an1}Let's go
to get something.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.645
Did you get a reservation?

25:21.728 --> 25:24.064
{\an1}Uh... no, I didn't,
but they said

25:24.147 --> 25:25.941
{\an1}we wouldn't need one,
but we've got to go right now.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.275
Okay?

25:27.359 --> 25:27.734
Okay, let's do it.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.909
{\an4}CLARE:
Oh, forgot my sweater,
one sec.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.412
The locksmith'll be here
in a half hour, okay?

25:39.496 --> 25:40.789
{\an1}Clare, wait.
Shh.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.625
Wait, Clare.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.835
Who's going to open the door?

25:49.506 --> 25:51.508
Ah, man.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.476
{\an1}Um... vanilla ice cream,
please.

26:01.559 --> 26:02.644
{\an3}No, no,
n-n-no.

26:02.727 --> 26:06.273
{\an3}She'll have
the tiramisu.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.816
{\an3}You can have ice
cream anytime.

26:07.899 --> 26:12.279
{\an1}Well, okay, but you have
to eat most of it.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.824
{\an3}I can't believe this is your
first time on the island.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.618
{\an1}So when do we have
to leave?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.120
{\an3}Uh, depends on what
time we get up.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.288
Excuse me?

26:21.371 --> 26:22.664
{\an3}We don't have to go
to sleep at all.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.458
I mean, we can watch
the sun come up together.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.836
Um, you wa--
you want to spend the night?

26:30.255 --> 26:33.258
Well, I,
I didn't bring any clothes.

26:33.341 --> 26:33.883
Well, you can wear
that again tomorrow.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.469
I won't mind.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.515
And we can always pick up
a toothbrush at the hotel.

26:40.598 --> 26:41.766
{\an3}You booked a hotel?
Well, I,

26:41.850 --> 26:45.520
I did call ahead and
their best room is available.

26:45.603 --> 26:48.648
Yeah, I bet it has
a king-size bed, right?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.483
{\an3}One big ol' bed, huh?
Oh,

26:50.567 --> 26:52.027
and wait
till you catch the view.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.154
(scoffs)

26:54.237 --> 26:56.823
You did say you wanted to see
this place during the day?

26:56.906 --> 26:58.158
(sighs)

26:58.241 --> 27:00.160
Griffin,
I meant some other time.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.703
{\an3}You knew that.
Well, I won't touch you.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.372
How about that?

27:04.456 --> 27:05.832
I'll be the...
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.376
Yeah, well,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.253
a perfect gentleman wouldn't
have put me in this position

27:10.337 --> 27:11.379
in the first place.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.922
{\an1}And a perfect gentleman
wouldn't have orchestrated

27:13.006 --> 27:15.842
this little overnight excursion
without asking me.

27:15.925 --> 27:18.345
{\an3}Don't get so
upset, all right?

27:18.428 --> 27:20.263
You don't want to stay over.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.389
I got the message.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.099
Good.
Waiter.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.726
(sighs)

27:24.809 --> 27:25.393
{\an1}This...

27:25.477 --> 27:28.521
gentleman needs his check.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.736
(Valerie sighs)

27:34.819 --> 27:37.072
Steve, I-I'm sorry.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.865
{\an1}I-I'm really tired
tonight.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.825
Maybe tomorrow?

27:40.909 --> 27:41.826
{\an1}I will.

27:41.910 --> 27:42.911
{\an1}Okay, bye.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.790
{\an3}It's okay
to come in?

27:46.873 --> 27:48.750
Sure.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.835
{\an3}(clearing throat):
Listen, Val,

27:50.919 --> 27:53.088
{\an3}if you're interested
in Dylan,

27:53.171 --> 27:54.881
{\an3}why don't you just
cut Steve loose?

27:54.964 --> 27:57.592
I told you, Brandon, there's
nothing between me and Dylan.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.593
Steve's a good friend of mine

27:58.676 --> 27:59.886
{\an3}and I don't want to
see him getting hung up

27:59.969 --> 28:00.887
{\an3}on someone who doesn't
appreciate him.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.931
I appreciate Steve.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.600
He's a great guy.

28:05.683 --> 28:08.436
{\an1}He's, he's fun,
he's very outgoing.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.772
{\an3}Whereas Dylan is a loner with
a big chip on his shoulder

28:10.855 --> 28:11.940
{\an3}and absolutely no
sense of humor.

28:12.023 --> 28:17.153
Well, maybe you just
don't understand him.

28:18.154 --> 28:19.781
{\an3}And you do, huh?
All I know is

28:19.864 --> 28:21.449
it's really hard
to keep a sense of humor

28:21.533 --> 28:23.243
about the way
the universe operates

28:23.326 --> 28:24.494
when you feel
like the joke's on you.

28:24.577 --> 28:28.540
Well, you wouldn't be the first
girl I shared a bathroom with

28:28.623 --> 28:31.793
who thought she could heal
his wounded psyche.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.128
And how would
your psyche hold up

28:33.211 --> 28:35.463
if your dad blew up in a car
right in front of your eyes?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.382
{\an3}I don't think
you'd be

28:37.465 --> 28:38.883
Mr. Congeniality either.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.970
{\an1}(scraping)

28:42.053 --> 28:43.805
Going somewhere?

28:44.889 --> 28:46.766
Yeah, I could use
some fresh air.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.308
Is that okay with you?

28:47.392 --> 28:50.437
Just be careful, Val.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.030
(door opens)

29:01.114 --> 29:03.032
Finally.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.493
Clare.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.163
Clare, get in here.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.290
Clare.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.374
Kelly?

29:17.088 --> 29:18.882
There's a very good explanation
for this.

29:21.050 --> 29:25.305
There, see,
don't you look pretty?

29:25.388 --> 29:27.307
Yes.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.893
Sure you don't want a little
weave, honey, just for fun?

29:29.976 --> 29:31.561
I'm sure.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.688
{\an1}I cannot get over
how gorgeous you turned out.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.523
{\an1}Of course, I don't know
why I'm so surprised.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.025
{\an1}You were
such a stunning child.

29:37.108 --> 29:41.196
{\an3}Thanks, Doreen, but I'm
not model beautiful.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.780
{\an1}Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.741
{\an1}You should be doing
this shoot.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.034
{\an1}No doubt
about that.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.202
Well, I wasn't asked.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.204
{\an1}Well, probably your mom
didn't want the competition.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.079
{\an1}With your looks,
you'd leave her in the dust.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.080
(chuckles)

29:51.164 --> 29:54.375
{\an1}And Jackie never
could stand sharing

29:54.459 --> 29:55.376
{\an1}that spotlight
with you.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.377
Now, could she?

29:56.461 --> 29:57.086
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

29:58.963 --> 30:02.217
Jackie, hi, you look great.

30:03.968 --> 30:08.097
How you doing, pumpkin?

30:08.181 --> 30:09.557
Mom, what's taking them so long?

30:09.641 --> 30:09.933
Patience, patience.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.059
We're up next.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.228
Well, you should have been
up first.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.395
You have a toddler here.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.063
Claude.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.065
How's it going?

30:17.148 --> 30:18.399
Good, good,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.194
uh, but Teresa has a plane
to catch, so I'm bumping her up.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.238
{\an3}You just relax,
hang out.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.322
{\an3}Do you want
something to eat?

30:24.405 --> 30:25.031
Um, a Calistoga?

30:25.114 --> 30:27.075
Claude,

30:27.158 --> 30:29.118
Erin's falling asleep.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.578
{\an3}She really needs
to go next.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.913
We'll wake her up.
It's not a problem.

30:31.996 --> 30:32.914
No, she's exhausted.

30:32.997 --> 30:33.915
Look at her.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.083
{\an1}CLAUDE:
What can I do?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.084
Take her home, then.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.043
We'll, uh, try to reschedule.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.044
Kelly.

30:38.127 --> 30:40.129
{\an1}What the hell
are you...

30:40.213 --> 30:41.756
You told me to look out
for her best interests.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.424
{\an1}She's not complaining,
she's fine.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.385
{\an1}I'm sorry, but...
I cannot believe you.

30:45.468 --> 30:46.177
{\an1}You didn't want me to do this
in the first place.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.263
{\an3}I should say the
same thing to you.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.764
{\an1}What's that supposed
to mean?

30:49.847 --> 30:50.932
Why didn't you ask me
to be in the shoot?

30:51.015 --> 30:53.101
Because you would have said no.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.435
{\an1}How do you know?
You have been nothing

30:54.519 --> 30:56.271
but negative since the beginning
of this thing.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.314
{\an1}If it's so bad for Erin
and so bad for me,

30:58.398 --> 31:00.108
{\an1}then why in the world
would <i> you</i> want to do it?

31:00.191 --> 31:01.109
Maybe I wouldn't have,

31:01.192 --> 31:02.068
{\an3}but you could
have asked.

31:02.151 --> 31:04.279
You could have shown me
that you thought of me

31:04.362 --> 31:06.906
as something more
than your on-call babysitter.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.741
Don't do me any favors.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.452
{\an1}I'm sorry if I imposed
on your time, Kelly.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.788
{\an1}Come on, sweetie, maybe
they can fit us in tomorrow.

31:13.871 --> 31:15.415
{\an1}Or maybe I'll just
go shoot myself.

31:18.209 --> 31:23.339
{\an1}How do we get ourselves
into these things, David?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.092
"Into" is not the question.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.803
{\an3}How we're going to get out
is what I want to know.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.138
Well, you'll be
a free man soon.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.433
{\an1}Good thing
the locksmith's open 24 hours.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.143
Yeah, well, hopefully it
won't take him 24 hours

31:35.226 --> 31:37.186
to get here this time.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.189
Oh, by the way, Ray
stopped by earlier.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.942
Oh, no, what'd he say?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.153
Well, I guess he was
pretty bummed you stood him up.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.821
{\an3}Clare said it seemed
like he was about ready

31:46.904 --> 31:48.323
to take his pumpkins
and go home.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.033
(clicks tongue)

31:50.116 --> 31:52.118
(sighs)

31:52.201 --> 31:53.536
He's a pretty intense guy,
isn't he?

31:53.620 --> 31:54.162
(door closes)

32:01.252 --> 32:03.838
(door closes)

32:03.921 --> 32:05.381
David, I've got to go find Ray.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.216
{\an1}Now?
Yes.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.217
He smashed the pumpkins.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.011
I've got to talk to him.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.055
Donna, you're kidding.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.097
Donna, don't leave.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.682
(door opens)

32:14.766 --> 32:16.142
Who's going to open the door
when the locksmith...

32:16.225 --> 32:18.519
(door closes)

32:18.603 --> 32:19.979
No!

32:20.063 --> 32:20.521
(groans loudly)

32:20.605 --> 32:22.899
(knocking)
Dylan.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.275
Hello?

32:26.235 --> 32:29.197
It's me.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.369
I've got to remember
to lock that door.

32:34.452 --> 32:35.912
Are you alone?

32:35.995 --> 32:37.163
{\an3}'Cause if
not, I'll go.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.206
And what if I am?

32:38.289 --> 32:40.083
Will you still go?

32:40.166 --> 32:42.585
Look, I just want
to talk to you.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.380
I think you've done
enough talking lately.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.381
{\an1}I don't know what you mean.
I mean I got

32:46.464 --> 32:49.300
a visit from Jim Walsh
I could live without.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.719
Can I help it
if he got a fax about you

32:51.803 --> 32:52.637
and started nosing around?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.305
You don't gotta give me
crap about a fax.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.683
I know you told him
that I'm broke.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.602
You don't lie very well.
I hate a liar.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.312
Well, you've been lying
to everybody for months.

33:01.396 --> 33:05.191
Pretending you're
still Richie Rich.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.109
Why were you trying
to hide it anyway?

33:06.192 --> 33:07.735
It was only a matter of time.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.529
So, what-- you did me
a big favor

33:09.612 --> 33:10.655
by expediting the inevitable?

33:10.738 --> 33:12.115
{\an1}I don't think
so, I think

33:12.198 --> 33:13.074
you're mad
'cause you came in here

33:13.157 --> 33:13.825
and caught me
with a girl the other night.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.702
{\an3}You don't know
how intimidating

33:15.785 --> 33:16.494
Jim Walsh can be.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.371
Oh, I know exactly
how intimidating

33:18.454 --> 33:19.372
Jim Walsh can be.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.707
What did he do, bully you?

33:20.790 --> 33:21.749
What am I supposed to do?

33:21.833 --> 33:22.250
I'm living in his house.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.252
Hey, stand up to him.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.753
I mean, Bren did.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.587
In fact she got pretty good
there in the old end,

33:26.671 --> 33:28.548
you know, standing up
to Big Jim.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.091
You know the Walshes were
really concerned about you.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.426
{\an3}Yeah,

33:31.509 --> 33:33.261
well, if they cared so much,
tell me this,

33:33.344 --> 33:35.096
why was I never good enough
for their daughter, huh?

33:35.179 --> 33:37.056
{\an3}At least Brenda
had the guts

33:37.140 --> 33:37.682
{\an3}to call 'em
on it.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.101
You know, I am not Brenda!

33:40.184 --> 33:41.769
I will never be Brenda!

33:41.853 --> 33:43.730
Don't talk to me about Brenda!

33:43.813 --> 33:45.106
No, you're not Brenda.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.232
{\an3}You're just pretending to be
and I think you like it.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.943
I think, I think you like
living in Brenda's house,

33:49.026 --> 33:49.610
you like sleeping
in Brenda's bed,

33:49.694 --> 33:51.112
{\an3}you got
Brenda's brother

33:51.195 --> 33:52.155
{\an3}and Brenda's
parents all there

33:52.238 --> 33:54.615
{\an3}in that nice cozy
little package,

33:54.699 --> 33:56.993
instant family!

33:57.076 --> 33:59.328
What's wrong with that?

34:05.251 --> 34:07.295
{\an3}Nothin'.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.274
(doorbell ringing)

34:30.359 --> 34:32.277
{\an1}Oh, hi.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.781
You just missed Brandon.

34:34.864 --> 34:35.531
{\an1}He-he should be back
soon though.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.492
{\an3}What're you still
doing here?

34:37.574 --> 34:39.327
I mean, I, uh,

34:39.409 --> 34:41.329
{\an5}thought you'd be gone
by now and...
It's all right.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.331
{\an1}Uh, Brandon tried
to call you.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.502
{\an1}We had a, um,
a change in plans.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.295
Ah.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.838
Well, so did I.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.547
Is everything all right?

34:51.630 --> 34:54.300
{\an3}Do you have any
ice cream?

34:54.382 --> 34:56.302
Oh, absolutely.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.387
{\an1}(chuckles)

35:00.723 --> 35:02.350
{\an3}My mom was constantly
reminding me

35:02.433 --> 35:05.812
that the camera
adds ten pounds.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.981
{\an3}So by the time
I was seven,

35:09.065 --> 35:09.941
I was so brainwashed

35:10.024 --> 35:13.236
{\an3}I wouldn't even eat
birthday cake anymore.

35:13.319 --> 35:16.239
Finally, I just got
sick of the pressure

35:16.322 --> 35:19.242
and I got fat.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.202
To spite her I think.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.996
{\an3}But I stayed that
way for awhile,

35:24.080 --> 35:25.414
till high school.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.709
{\an1}I just can't see your mother
putting Erin

35:28.793 --> 35:29.544
through the same turmoil.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.420
{\an1}I'm sure she is really
looking at this

35:31.504 --> 35:33.548
as just a one time thing.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.216
It just felt like she was

35:35.299 --> 35:37.343
{\an3}trying to sneak
something past me.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.346
So what's bothering you more...

35:40.429 --> 35:42.849
that she put Erin to work,

35:42.932 --> 35:44.892
or that she didn't tell you
she was doing it?

35:44.976 --> 35:48.187
I don't know.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.065
Maybe it was
that she didn't ask me

35:51.148 --> 35:52.275
to be in the shoot with her.

35:52.358 --> 35:56.070
She claimed I would've just
turned her down.

35:56.153 --> 35:58.072
{\an1}You know,
that sounds exactly

35:58.155 --> 36:00.074
like the excuse
Brenda gave me

36:00.157 --> 36:00.867
{\an1}when she didn't
ask me to be

36:00.950 --> 36:03.035
{\an1}in that mother-daughter
fashion show

36:03.119 --> 36:04.745
at the high school.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.873
{\an3}The fashion show
from hell?

36:06.956 --> 36:07.748
{\an1}Yeah.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.334
{\an1}That was the first time
I met your mother.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.588
I'm sure she made a great
first impression on you.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.256
{\an3}Only Jackie would think
that she could

36:15.339 --> 36:18.968
MC the show high
and nobody would notice.

36:19.051 --> 36:23.139
You know, your mother has come
a long way since then.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.349
{\an1}I mean, think about
what she's been through.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.351
She got married, she had a baby,

36:27.435 --> 36:29.312
she got divorced,

36:29.395 --> 36:33.107
and through it all
she stayed clean and sober.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.359
And she still manages
to look fabulous at 40.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.445
{\an1}Boy,

36:37.528 --> 36:41.282
{\an1}if someone asked me to be
in an ad campaign like that,

36:41.365 --> 36:43.659
ooh, I'd jump
at the chance.

36:43.743 --> 36:47.663
{\an1}Like to try some
chocolate chip mint?

36:47.747 --> 36:50.958
No, thanks.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.461
Will you just, uh,

36:53.544 --> 36:55.504
tell Brandon that I'll
talk to him tomorrow?

36:55.588 --> 36:58.090
Yeah.

37:02.219 --> 37:04.305
(crickets chirping)

37:32.500 --> 37:34.460
{\an3}(footsteps)

37:34.543 --> 37:35.503
Who's there?

37:35.586 --> 37:37.797
Donna?

37:37.880 --> 37:38.965
You scared me!

37:39.048 --> 37:41.509
You shouldn't be walking around
out here alone at night.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.053
Well, I'm not alone.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.013
You're with me.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.015
You have a point.

37:48.099 --> 37:48.516
So, how was your date?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.435
Ray, I'm so sorry.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.688
You said you'd call me,

37:53.771 --> 37:55.815
and then when I called you,
you weren't there and...

37:58.401 --> 38:01.320
...And it was terrible.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.363
I would've rather have been
with you.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.032
Yeah? So why'd you go?

38:05.116 --> 38:08.369
Look, he wouldn't take no
for an answer.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.079
So he put the moves on you?

38:10.162 --> 38:12.748
Ray...

38:12.832 --> 38:15.209
Hey, none of my business.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.838
{\an1}(sighs)

38:18.921 --> 38:20.840
{\an1}Look, I...

38:20.923 --> 38:23.926
{\an1}I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I was.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.472
{\an6}You came all the way
out here to tell me
you were sorry?

38:31.308 --> 38:32.476
You're crazy.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.690
{\an1}So, does that mean
you forgive me?

38:37.773 --> 38:39.567
I trashed your pumpkins

38:39.650 --> 38:41.360
{\an3}and you're asking me
to forgive you?

38:41.444 --> 38:43.863
Well, about that, you,

38:43.946 --> 38:45.990
{\an1}you know, you could've
just left me a note.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.868
{\an3}I guess it's my turn
to apologize.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.746
No, you don't have to.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.749
{\an3}I don't know what came
over me, Donna.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.376
{\an3}It's only 'cause I
care about you.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.420
Maybe a little too much.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.882
{\an1}I don't think
that's possible.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.307
I would never push you

39:11.390 --> 39:14.268
{\an3}to do anything you didn't
want to do, Donna.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.271
I'd never pressure
you into anything.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.232
Well, that's
good to know.

39:20.316 --> 39:23.319
{\an3}I just want to
be with you.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.503
If you're going
to bawl me out again,

39:40.586 --> 39:42.254
can it wait until tomorrow?

39:42.338 --> 39:44.799
I'm not going to bawl you out.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.843
{\an3}'Cause Claude
promised

39:47.927 --> 39:49.095
{\an3}he would squeeze
me in tomorrow

39:49.178 --> 39:52.098
{\an6}and I have to look
like I got a few
hours sleep.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.682
{\an1}Well, maybe
you'll sleep better

39:53.766 --> 39:56.143
{\an1}after I say
what I have to say.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.437
{\an3}Okay, on one
condition.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.439
{\an3}You can't make me cry.
I'll be too puffy.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.608
I can't promise that.

40:02.691 --> 40:03.818
Uh-oh.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.319
Just listen.

40:05.402 --> 40:08.656
{\an1}I realized that I've been
too hard on you.

40:08.739 --> 40:13.828
I mean, even though
the modeling thing

40:13.911 --> 40:16.831
{\an1}didn't turn out so well
for us in the past,

40:16.914 --> 40:19.458
{\an1}you're a much stronger
person now

40:19.542 --> 40:21.460
and a much better mother.

40:21.544 --> 40:24.296
{\an3}My eyes are gonna
be little pits.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.216
I just wanted to say

40:27.299 --> 40:30.219
{\an1}that I'm not gonna put
my two cents in anymore,

40:30.302 --> 40:33.347
not unless you ask.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.474
But I wish you'd ask.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.436
Well,

40:39.520 --> 40:40.604
{\an3}I have a confession
to make.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.192
The real reason

40:45.276 --> 40:48.195
{\an3}I didn't want you
in the shoot

40:48.279 --> 40:50.239
was a very selfish one,

40:50.322 --> 40:51.699
{\an3}because they asked for both
you and Erin, you know.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.576
They did?

40:54.827 --> 40:57.788
But then I pictured the ad,

40:57.872 --> 41:01.584
and I thought
if anyone saw a toddler

41:01.667 --> 41:02.668
{\an3}and a young
woman,

41:02.751 --> 41:04.670
and an older women,

41:04.753 --> 41:06.714
they wouldn't think
the older woman

41:06.797 --> 41:08.966
was the mother of the other two.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.718
They would think
you were Erin's mother,

41:10.801 --> 41:13.387
which leaves me as...
the grandma.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.475
I can't even say the word
without shivering.

41:18.559 --> 41:19.727
Mother...

41:19.810 --> 41:21.729
I just wasn't ready
to be the "older generation".

41:21.812 --> 41:23.731
{\an3}Can you understand
that at all?

41:23.814 --> 41:26.400
Come on, don't they say
"Life begins at 40"?

41:26.483 --> 41:29.653
The slogan I remember is
"Don't trust anyone over 30."

41:29.737 --> 41:31.655
It's funny.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.616
Because I thought the reason

41:33.699 --> 41:36.869
that you didn't want me
to be in the shoot with you

41:36.952 --> 41:39.079
was because you didn't think
I was pretty enough.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.291
Oh, no, was that
what you really thought?

41:42.374 --> 41:45.753
{\an3}Because you are a very
beautiful girl,

41:45.836 --> 41:49.673
and I would be proud to show
you off as my daughter.

42:00.809 --> 42:02.770
{\an1}Fess up, Silver.
Come on,

42:02.853 --> 42:04.772
in the beginning, in
the very beginning,

42:04.855 --> 42:06.899
{\an3}before Clare's
father got there,

42:06.982 --> 42:08.901
{\an3}when you were a captive
in handcuffs

42:08.984 --> 42:10.611
and at her mercy--

42:10.694 --> 42:12.738
{\an6}don't even tell me you
weren't a little
bit turned on?

42:12.821 --> 42:14.949
Steve, I can't even believe
you're asking me about this,

42:15.032 --> 42:16.492
{\an1}all right,
it was a nightmare.

42:16.575 --> 42:16.992
{\an3}I live for stuff
like this.

42:17.076 --> 42:17.785
Imagine if she...

42:17.868 --> 42:19.995
{\an1}I don't need to imagine
anything.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.121
I was there!

42:21.205 --> 42:21.830
{\an1}All right,
my wrist still hurts.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.250
{\an3}(laughs)

42:24.333 --> 42:24.750
{\an3}Was she pissed you
broke her bed?

42:24.833 --> 42:26.752
{\an1}Excuse me,

42:26.835 --> 42:28.796
{\an1}but anyone who drives
all the way to Monterey Park

42:28.879 --> 42:30.089
{\an1}to go to her favorite
Chinese restaurant,

42:30.172 --> 42:32.800
then talks her dad into seeing
a double feature at the Nuart,

42:32.883 --> 42:34.760
has no right to be pissed.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.470
I mean, I could've died
waiting there for her.

42:36.553 --> 42:36.762
You could've
chewed your arm off.

42:36.845 --> 42:39.598
Shut up.

42:39.682 --> 42:40.849
{\an3}Hey man, you couldn't
have died.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.310
{\an1}Steve, I don't want to argue
about this anymore, all right.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.270
I could have died,
and that's final!

42:44.353 --> 42:45.854
{\an3}All right, whatever
you say, bondage boy.

42:45.938 --> 42:49.733
{\an1}That's very funny,
just drive.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.820
(horn honking)

42:52.903 --> 42:53.821
(knocking on door)

42:53.904 --> 42:54.822
McKay!

42:54.905 --> 42:56.824
{\an3}(sighs)

42:56.907 --> 42:59.326
{\an3}Guys, it's a little
early, isn't it?

42:59.410 --> 43:00.244
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

43:00.327 --> 43:01.662
but you'll never guess
what I have here.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.539
I've got
the preliminary sketches

43:03.622 --> 43:05.332
to the new and improved
Peach Pit After Dark.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.667
{\an1}Great. Steve,
I'll tell you what.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.377
{\an1}I'll look at 'em later,
but thanks for stopping by.

43:08.460 --> 43:08.836
{\an3}Well, wait, can't
you look at 'em now?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.671
Come on, pal,

43:10.754 --> 43:11.672
I can't get any bids
without these plans.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.466
We gotta strike
while the iron is hot.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.676
{\an1}Steve, we'll strike
while the iron is warm,

43:15.759 --> 43:16.719
{\an5}okay?
Look, we're at a critical stage,
right here.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.138
I don't want to waste any time.
That's why

43:19.221 --> 43:19.930
I had to light a fire
underneath the designer's butt.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.765
{\an3}The guy was up
all night, Dylan.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.809
{\an1}He's not the only one,
Steve.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.853
This'll just
take a minute.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.354
{\an3}Look, uh,

43:27.438 --> 43:28.272
{\an3}maybe we should do this
another time, Steve.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.232
There's no time
like the present, David.

43:30.316 --> 43:31.650
{\an3}Yeah, well, maybe
we should, uh,

43:31.734 --> 43:33.027
{\an3}let Dylan look at these
when he's had time

43:33.110 --> 43:35.029
{\an3}to wake up.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.532
Feast your eyes on this!

43:38.615 --> 43:40.492
Steve,

43:40.576 --> 43:42.494
{\an3}don't get the wrong
idea or anything.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.371
{\an1}Yeah, Val, I think
he already got the idea.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.414
Oh, I get it,

43:45.497 --> 43:46.915
joke's on me, huh?

43:49.293 --> 43:51.211
On second thought,

43:51.295 --> 43:53.422
why don't we just, uh...

43:53.505 --> 43:55.549
cut our losses here, okay?

43:56.800 --> 43:59.636
{\an1}You know, I've got something
else for you, McKay...
