too young for this.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.408
I absolutely am, yep.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.619
We had a six-year drought
in California.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.122
BILLY: Yeah,
they told us to take a shower

40:57.164 --> 40:59.291
- with a friend. Remember that?
- Come on.

40:59.332 --> 41:00.876
- And we did.
- Why?

41:00.917 --> 41:02.335
Because it was fun.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.837
It was... fun.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.672
Anyway, because of the drought,

41:05.714 --> 41:08.216
the Department
of Water Resources decided

41:08.258 --> 41:11.094
to cut back...
on the ranchers' water,

41:11.136 --> 41:13.138
giving preference
to the residential use.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.264
PATTY: That makes sense.

41:14.306 --> 41:15.473
Yeah.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.058
Only when it happened again,

41:17.100 --> 41:19.186
the ranchers threatened
to sue the state.

41:19.227 --> 41:22.564
Only instead of going to court,

41:22.606 --> 41:26.026
they arranged for a secret,
closed-door meeting

41:26.067 --> 41:27.819
with the Department
of Water Resources

41:27.861 --> 41:31.573
and L.A.'s Metropolitan
Water District...

41:31.615 --> 41:33.575
- in Big Sur.
- BILLY: Big Sur.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.076
Yes, sir.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.578
Yes, sir. Big Sur.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.831
Because of this secret
Big Sur agreement, in exchange

41:39.873 --> 41:42.751
for cutting the ranchers' water
during the drought,

41:42.792 --> 41:45.253
these sneaky shits,

41:45.295 --> 41:48.215
these little douchebag ranchers
managed

41:48.256 --> 41:50.508
to get the state
to give them total control

41:50.550 --> 41:52.928
of the state's water bank.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.512
What's a water bank?

41:54.554 --> 41:56.097
BILLY: It's an underground reservoir.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.934
The state uses it
to store surplus water

41:58.975 --> 42:01.311
when it actually fucking rains.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.521
- How do you know that?
- I read Delores's pamphlet.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.273
Very cool.

42:05.315 --> 42:08.526
Delores. Delores.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.529
She's a really sweet lady.

42:12.781 --> 42:15.116
Billy,
I promised to protect her.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.744

42:19.955 --> 42:21.748
Yeah.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.084
So you're the lawyers
who are gonna help us,

42:24.125 --> 42:25.669
uh, with this water situation.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.295

42:27.337 --> 42:29.631
Oh. Violet mentioned you.

42:29.673 --> 42:32.759
I'm, uh, Gloria, her girlfriend.

42:32.801 --> 42:36.721

42:41.017 --> 42:43.311
That's nice.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.105
(SIGHS)
So, essentially,

42:45.146 --> 42:48.566
this Big Sur agreement just
gives the ranchers the ability

42:48.608 --> 42:51.069
to use a public resource
to fill their own pockets.

42:51.111 --> 42:53.613
While everyone in town
doesn't have water.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.949
- Yeah.
- Well, if we can prove that

42:55.991 --> 42:57.867
they're distributing water
unfairly,

42:57.909 --> 43:00.370
we can turn Gene's case
into a class action suit.

43:00.412 --> 43:01.913
Yeah.

43:01.955 --> 43:06.459
Well, I got to get these papers
back to Delores, but, uh...

I'll-I'll put together a list

43:08.503 --> 43:10.255

are getting the water.

we take your case,

and we roll it
into a class action lawsuit.

we can get you compensation,
