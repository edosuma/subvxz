he told me... told me,
"This isn't over."

This is our winery, too.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.965
My family has been
working this land

11:05.065 --> 11:06.900
three generations.
We don't run.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.902
Especially with
this company

11:09.002 --> 11:12.139
the boss hired running things.
They lit that blaze.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.373
Where's the head Nozzle?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.476
Head Nozzle--
that's a first.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.045
Faye Stone.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.613
I sent a chopper
to your train fire. Oh.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.482
You're the one responsible
for this mess.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.986
You know that backfire you lit,
technically illegal,

11:26.086 --> 11:27.921
not to mention
extremely reckless.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.456
Okay, we're trying to protect

11:29.556 --> 11:31.524
our client's assets.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.094
As opposed to theirs?

11:34.194 --> 11:37.264
It's not my choice.
It's my client's.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.599
Glad you got your
priorities straight.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.834
Okay, Vince.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.369
Faye, you're gonna
take your crew

11:42.469 --> 11:44.204
and you're gonna put them
on your client's assets

11:44.304 --> 11:46.706
and we will handle
the larger vegetation fire

11:46.807 --> 11:47.975
before it overruns
the property.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.277
I'm glad we could be in sync.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.313
You know, Bode will be
well set up for his future.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.547
I'm thrilled

11:54.647 --> 11:55.648
that your son is
coming aboard Nozzle

11:55.749 --> 11:56.784
when he paroles.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.186
What?
No. No, he's not.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.089
Wait, Manny didn't loop you in?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.024
He's gonna bring him over
with him.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.196
Manny's coming to work for... Me.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.731
Head Nozzle.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.001
I'll get my crew
on the vineyard.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.806
That doesn't sound right.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.373
I mean...
Bode wouldn't do that, right?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.242
I mean, what... I mean,
why wouldn't Manny tell us?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.711
You know what,
I'm in as much shock as you are,

12:24.812 --> 12:26.413
and right now we have to pick
our battles, so

12:26.513 --> 12:29.016
we're gonna pick that fire. Yeah.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.995
Yo, this would have been
a lovely spot

12:42.095 --> 12:44.364
for a destination wedding, huh?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.666
Still can be.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.336
We, uh, we get
this thing put out,

12:49.436 --> 12:52.572
I'm sure they'd give you
one hell of a discount.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.842
All right, gentlemen,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.676
eyes up and watch
each other's six.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.914
Here's to one of our last fires
together in orange, Goat.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.183
Yes, sir. Let's go
big and go home.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.118
Let's go, fellas.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.560
Hey, Chiefs,
what's the situation?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.495
You tell us.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.597
Thanks to your future boss
there, Nozzle,

13:17.697 --> 13:19.833
got a hell of a mess
on our hands.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.401
I was gonna tell you guys.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.903
When?
Yeah.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.038
When our son's under
your command lighting

13:25.138 --> 13:28.108
unauthorized backfires
for kajillionaires?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.443
Come on, Bode. This is who
you want to work for?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.980
Dad, nothing's been decided yet.
Three Rock,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.448
go cut line
at the head of the right flank.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.917
Copy that, Chief.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.385
Vince, it's a good gig,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.787
and I only have his
best interests at heart.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.656
His or yours?

13:43.756 --> 13:45.893
Ours.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.760
Let's go, fellas. Dad...

13:47.861 --> 13:50.463
Come on. I got to be realistic
about my future.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.532
Yeah.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.301
Guess I do, too.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.776
Great work, Three Rock.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.879
How we do it.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.555
Hey, I'll be right back.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.024
Bode, you got this?

14:17.124 --> 14:19.059
We all got this, Cap.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.597
So, that's what your
big pep talk was about?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.399
You got yourself
a job at Nozzle

14:26.499 --> 14:30.170
and now you want our help
to impress your new boss?
No.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.704
He's playing us.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.206
This dude's
out for himself.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.508
And we need to be out
for ourselves.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.477
There ain't no fences
out here either, boys.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.613
You keep talking all this trash
about a... about a jailbreak.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.715
And what? What?

14:42.815 --> 14:46.686
You worried you and Cap won't
get your cush, sellout jobs?

14:46.786 --> 14:49.822
No.
I'm worried that these folks

14:49.923 --> 14:51.758
will lose all they've
sacrificed for.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.194
All this stuff right here, this
is how they feed their families.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.329
We don't cut this line,
they lose it all.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.931
Look, man, you-you don't want
to show up for me,

14:58.031 --> 14:59.266
for this crew,
for yourself,

14:59.366 --> 15:00.833
show up for them.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.908
I know you want to clean up
Three Rock before you parole,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.077
but trust me, B,

15:10.177 --> 15:12.479
these dudes are not worth it.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.218
Same could have
been said for me.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.622
So, your version is we had
a fling and that was it?

15:22.722 --> 15:23.957
Yeah.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.260
Maybe if things after
had gone differently...

15:27.360 --> 15:28.795
What things?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.965
Kyle, you winning
gold medals and

15:32.065 --> 15:34.201
not returning my texts
for weeks.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.337
I was an idiot,
swept up in-in all of the...

15:37.437 --> 15:38.738
Magazine covers

15:38.838 --> 15:41.708
and TV shows. I saw you.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.576
Everywhere.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.913
Meanwhile, my career was over.

15:47.714 --> 15:48.881
Are you happy?

15:48.982 --> 15:51.051
I'm genuinely asking.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.753
This three restaurant,

15:53.853 --> 15:56.056
more stop signs
than stoplights town,

15:56.156 --> 15:57.890
and the inmate
that comes with it.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.626
He's getting out in two days.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.761
So, the ex-con, then.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.296
When he's out
and being with him

16:03.396 --> 16:06.666
and living here is as real
as a straitjacket,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.968
will you be happy?

16:09.069 --> 16:12.339
Because you deserve
happiness, Gabs,

16:12.439 --> 16:14.507
more than anyone I know.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.809
Hi.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.645
I, uh...

16:18.745 --> 16:20.080
I was supposed to

16:20.180 --> 16:22.949
meet an old girlfriend
from high school here.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.817
I want to take
her fishing,

16:24.917 --> 16:27.754
but, uh, I was stashing

16:27.854 --> 16:30.190
my gear in the trunk,

16:30.290 --> 16:33.760
and a car hit me from
behind, just out there

16:33.860 --> 16:37.464
in the parking lot, and threw me
into the, into the trunk,

16:37.564 --> 16:39.499
and...

16:39.599 --> 16:41.068
guy drove away.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.770
Just right now?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.373
H-How are you feeling?
Uh...

16:48.075 --> 16:51.010
It-it doesn't
really even hurt.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.614
My fishing knife
was just...

16:56.483 --> 16:57.717
If I just...
No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.018
Don't do that!

16:59.119 --> 17:01.088
Okay, we're gonna sit you down.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.356
Sir, we're gonna lay you down.
What do I do?

17:03.456 --> 17:06.093
Call 911.
Get me a first aid kit

17:06.193 --> 17:07.594
and all the clean towels
you have.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.430
Coming, right now!
Okay, breathe, breathe.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.031
Breathe.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.433
Where are my towels?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.442
Watch out for
that spot fire.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.843
Right.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.578
Nice work, y'all.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.815
Hey, Eve.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.084
Did Bode tell you the big news?

17:31.184 --> 17:32.785
What?
Cookie's driving up.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.721
We making it legal.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.923
Oh, wow, Freddy,
congrats, man.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.358
I thought it'd be cool
if, in my vows,

17:38.458 --> 17:40.293
I could spring
a date on her, like,

17:40.393 --> 17:43.896
"You believed in me, bae,
I'll see you in May."

17:43.996 --> 17:45.298
You know what?
That's corny.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.500
You know what?
That sounds great. I'll see

17:47.600 --> 17:49.569
what I can find out. Yeah.
Okay, cool.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.106
Well...

17:53.206 --> 17:55.575
what rhymes
with "two years"?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.876
It's not funny.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.580
I'm not laughing, Eve.
It's awful.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.550
But it's only getting
worse the longer you take

18:03.650 --> 18:05.585
to tell him the truth.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.289
You know he deserves that much.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.262
You told my chiefs,

18:15.362 --> 18:17.697
Bode's parents,
that we're coming to Nozzle?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.133
Damn it, Faye.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.101
I wanted to do this
the right way.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.137
Manny, I made a mistake.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.473
I slipped and they
were caught off guard.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.243
I am doing their son and the
rest of these guys a solid.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.611
And now I need one, too.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.013
We need to create
more defensive space

18:34.113 --> 18:35.648
so we can protect the
vineyard's main house.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.151
Faye...
I-Isn't Bode first saw?
Come on.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.886
Sharon's division leader here.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.521
Everything has to
go through her first.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.791
Well, she told me to put my guys
on the vines and the tree lines.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.293
I'm following
her command.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.660
And Bode's following mine.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.129
He's cutting line, not trees,

18:50.230 --> 18:52.165
with the rest of Three Rock.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.568
I got to go back to them.
I'm sorry.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.575
<i>The vineyard fire's
mostly contained.</i>

19:02.675 --> 19:04.377
We're gonna have to
help Nozzle now

19:04.477 --> 19:06.513
to protect the winery's
main house.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.847
Best way to do that?

19:07.947 --> 19:09.782
Kick them out of here
for starting that backfire.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.851
They could not have known
the wind was gonna shift.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.520
Wh-Why are you
defending them?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.255
I don't know,
it's complicated.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.557
Cal Fire's in charge but
this is private property

19:17.657 --> 19:20.493
that the owners hired
Nozzle to protect

19:20.593 --> 19:23.196
and if Manny and Bode
go to work for them...

19:23.296 --> 19:25.532
Manny can do whatever the hell
he wants, but Bode...

19:25.632 --> 19:28.235
Bode is a 30-year-old man who
has to make his own decisions.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.669
Since when?
I don't know.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.004
It's called growth.
I'm trying this out.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.676
Hey, Chief,
who's running the saw?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.478
Who do you think?

19:44.251 --> 19:46.653
Chief, that's a power line.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.155
Nozzle, halt all work.

19:49.256 --> 19:52.091
Hey, stop cutting. Stop cutting!
Power line!

19:54.461 --> 19:55.595
Wait, are those...

19:55.695 --> 19:58.698
Fuel tanks!
Get down, everyone!

20:03.236 --> 20:05.272
My parents.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.085
Mom! Dad!

20:19.185 --> 20:21.153
Everybody okay?

20:21.254 --> 20:22.555
This fuel fire's not.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.223
Water's not gonna
put this out.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.358
We need foam.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.826
That or a Co2 extinguisher.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.296
We have a few on
the truck. Let's go. Right.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.965
First the backfire, now this.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.501
You trying to burn
this place down?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.669
Do you have class B foam or Co2?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.905
Not enough.
Wait a minute.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.508
Don't winery's use Co2
in manufacturing?

20:41.608 --> 20:42.809
Right?
He'd be the guy to ask.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.544
We have Co2 canisters
in the plant.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.579
Okay, Three Rock,
you go with Santino.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.581
42, get that

20:48.681 --> 20:50.517
on these trees right now!

20:51.451 --> 20:54.253
Nozzle, get whatever foam you
have and get it on that fire.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.590
Hey, are you seriously
keeping them on this incident?

20:57.690 --> 21:00.192
I need the manpower. We will
put this fire out together.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.128
Come on!

21:06.699 --> 21:08.167
I need a tourniquet.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.036
911 says they're
five minutes out.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.405
His femoral artery's pumping
like it's completely severed.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.973
If we wait five minutes,

21:14.073 --> 21:16.042
it's gonna be way too much blood
that he loses.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.577
Uh...

21:17.677 --> 21:20.380
C-Come put pressure
on this side. Okay.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.283
Okay, ready?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.353
Get it. Okay.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.789
Are you that swimmer?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.724
Diver.
Huh.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.260
And yes, that's him.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.129
Can I get a picture with you?

21:37.229 --> 21:39.031
Totally.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.967
I even have my medal
in my backpack.

21:41.067 --> 21:45.137
You can wear it, okay?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.275
Pulse is racing.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.344
He's losing too much blood,
even with the tourniquet,

21:51.444 --> 21:52.912
which means I...

21:54.581 --> 21:57.216
Okay. Hey, Oscar.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.486
Huh?
I'm gonna need to reach

21:59.586 --> 22:00.987
in your wound with my hands

22:01.087 --> 22:03.523
and pinch it
with my fingers, okay?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.191
It's going to hurt.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.629
Ah... Oh!

22:09.729 --> 22:11.364
It's okay, just breathe.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.434
Breathe. Hey, hey, here,
hold my hand.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.570
Why don't you talk to me about
your high school sweetheart?

22:17.670 --> 22:18.971
Tell me about her. Rosanna.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.373
Mm-hmm.
Rosanna.

22:20.473 --> 22:23.443
I planned something
more romantic than...

22:23.543 --> 22:25.378
than this is

22:25.478 --> 22:29.782
for the first time she's
seeing me in 50 years.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.987
Well, you're gonna have one
hell of a story to tell her.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.424
This way, guys! This way!
Go!

22:37.524 --> 22:38.858
It's right on this corner.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.760
Right there.
All right, Three Rocks,

22:40.860 --> 22:42.562
get this Co2 out there.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.365
Dad, the flames are getting
closer to our trailer.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.235
We... we need line cut,
we need water. We ne...

22:49.335 --> 22:50.803
We can't worry about
that right now.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.539
We got a bigger fuel fire.
Dad!

22:52.639 --> 22:55.007
Sir, sir, please, go protect
your place and your family.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.476
We got this.
That's what I'm trying to do!

22:56.576 --> 22:58.978
This winery, these vines,
this is our legacy.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.280
Dad, we don't own this place.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.716
Everything we own will be gone.
Stop!

23:03.816 --> 23:05.017
Cap, can't we
split the crew in half?

23:05.117 --> 23:06.318
Half of us move the Co2,
the other half

23:06.419 --> 23:07.954
go with Santino
to help his family.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.657
All right, Lonnegan, Beck
and Troy go cut line.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.224
Prove Bode's right about you.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.761
You got to go.
Let's get it.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.328
Hey, hey.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.831
This is your shot to show Cap
what you're all about.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.535
Not just him.
Gonna show you, too.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.710
Thanks, Freddy.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.878
I got your back
like you got mine.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.914
Freddy, I, um...
About your case.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.716
I heard from the lawyer.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.985
Ooh, who I can't wait
to thank in person.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.587
Cookie and I are driving
straight to their offices.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.288
No, Freddy, I...

23:43.089 --> 23:45.224
I'm not sure we're gonna
be able to get you out.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.259
What do you mean?
It...

23:48.027 --> 23:49.462
Your-your alibi is sticking,

23:49.562 --> 23:51.731
it's just
the p-the processing time,

23:51.831 --> 23:53.199
it's gonna take... Eve.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.901
How long?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.338
The rest of your sentence.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.576
Look, I wanted this so badly
for you, you know I did.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.111
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
And I didn't mean...

24:05.211 --> 24:07.780
Don't beat yourself up.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.149
You did everything you could.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.819
It's the system that failed.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.489
It always is.
We good.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.962
We good.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.051
What's wrong?

24:47.754 --> 24:50.590
I, uh...

24:50.690 --> 24:52.391
I'm-I'm not getting out.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.562
What?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.964
No, that-that can't be.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.899
Hey, you know what, um,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.301
I'm still getting married.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.637
And, um...

25:04.737 --> 25:06.505
you-you... you

25:06.606 --> 25:08.541
just got to promise me
you'll live your best life

25:08.641 --> 25:11.611
when you're on parole.
All right, man?

25:14.647 --> 25:16.448
My best life's gonna
be devoting every day

25:16.549 --> 25:17.984
to getting you out.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.889
Hey.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.991
Let's go put this
fire out, all right?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.593
All right. Let's go.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.766
We still got a few more
cannisters left.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.401
You're a little too late.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.404
All this fuel's on a direct path
to that manufacturing plant.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.206
We got pesticides, fertilizer.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.641
And my guys cutting line.

25:41.741 --> 25:45.645
Hey, y'all, nobody's
cutting line down there.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.416
Where's Lonnegan
and the guys?

26:03.996 --> 26:05.197
Boys.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.633
Troy!
Beck!

26:13.139 --> 26:15.274
Where the hell'd they go?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.309
Bode, you have to tell him.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.012
Tell me what?

26:21.881 --> 26:23.449
Earlier at camp,

26:23.549 --> 26:25.985
Lonnegan was talking about
trying to escape.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.229
Captain Manny Perez
reporting three MIA inmates:

26:37.329 --> 26:38.998
Troy Elliot, Norm Beck,
Felix Lonnegan.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.734
Last known location:
Last Blush Winery.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.602
Copy that.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.071
Hey, Captain.
Look, Cap.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.839
You know these guys
talk a good game,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.607
but they're not... they're no
fugitives, Cap. You know that.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.576
I don't know that, Bode,
and neither do you.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.244
And they left their
damn packs there.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.646
Stop vouching for them.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.347
You're right, yeah, it's on me.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.083
It's on me, Bode.

26:57.183 --> 27:01.087
Because I listened to you,
and I'm done with that.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.556
Three Rock!

27:04.657 --> 27:06.926
Get your hook line
and hit the buggy now.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.627
Wait, we're just leaving?
No, Goat.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.162
We're doing unit accountability
right now.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.632
Can't afford to misplace
any more firefighters today.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.538
I told you those guys
were not worth it.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.774
I still don't believe that.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.209
And I don't believe
they tried to escape.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.844
Bode, come on.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.278
No, last thing Lonnegan
said to me was

27:26.378 --> 27:28.047
he was gonna show me
what he was about.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.516
He's a firefighter.
Hey, hey.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.084
He left us at that fire.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.020
Maybe to go fight another one.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.026
Santino and his kids.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.263
Hey, hey, dude...

27:46.198 --> 27:48.367
Really?

27:55.775 --> 27:59.545
Hey. This is Oscar,
68 years old.

27:59.645 --> 28:01.247
Knife wound to
the femoral artery.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.449
I have it pinched.
He has a weak pulse

28:03.549 --> 28:05.952
but he keeps coming
in and out of consciousness.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.354
Just keep holding on
until I get the clamp on.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.690
Okay.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.927
Great. You can let go.

28:21.768 --> 28:26.505
Oscar, these people are gonna
take you to the hospital.

28:26.605 --> 28:27.840
Can I call someone?

28:27.940 --> 28:30.743
My brother Bruce.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.946
Here, take my phone.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.819
Password, uh, Rosanna1972.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.687
A woman you haven't seen

28:41.788 --> 28:43.756
in over 50 years
is your password?

28:43.856 --> 28:46.158
Just wait till you see her.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.660
She's gonna think
I stood her up.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.732
Hold here.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.673
Hey, I'm gonna go with Oscar
to the hospital.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.543
Stay here and wait for Rosanna
and meet us over there, okay?

29:04.643 --> 29:05.945
Wind's picking up.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
I don't know how much longer
we can hold this off.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.415
The direction
is shifting, too.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.184
The head of the vegetation
fire is beelining it north.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.054
Right toward
Santino's trailer.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.590
They're the ones
we should be protecting.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.893
All engine teams

29:20.993 --> 29:23.295
relocate to
the southwest corridor.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.265
Hold the line at the road.
D.C. Leone.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.468
This is a $50 million property. Yeah,

29:29.568 --> 29:31.871
that your crew
lit on fire.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.940
Okay, please, I have
a contract to honor.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.808
Yeah, and I have
a community to serve,

29:35.908 --> 29:37.476
so unless you want
law enforcement

29:37.576 --> 29:38.878
to walk you off this property,

29:38.978 --> 29:40.379
I suggest you get moving.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.515
This feels personal.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.651
Yeah, it is personal,
but not as a mother,

29:45.751 --> 29:47.553
As a Cal Fire chief.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.388
Okay, come on.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.990
That's my girl.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.424
All right, you all
heard D.C. Leone.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.260
We're moving, let's go.
Hey, Chiefs.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.562
Bode and Freddy,
are they here?

29:56.662 --> 29:57.897
No. Why?

29:57.997 --> 29:59.899
'Cause I'm missing
three firefighters,

29:59.999 --> 30:01.400
and I think they
went in to find 'em

30:01.500 --> 30:02.801
over by Santino's trailer.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.104
My son is supposed to parole
in two days!

30:05.204 --> 30:06.738
I know that, Chief. I know.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.375
Even with hoses
that's a death trap.

30:11.243 --> 30:15.347
All units be advised
I have five unaccounted for

30:15.447 --> 30:17.083
Three Rock firefighters.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.052
One of them is my son.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.470
Hey.
Hi.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.606
This is Rosanna.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.141
Where's Oscar?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.976
Uh...
Is he in surgery?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.345
No, he-he's in the ER.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.115
Oh. Can I see him?
Is that allowed?

30:49.215 --> 30:51.951
I mean, well, I'm not family,

30:52.051 --> 30:54.353
but I'm an old flame.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.988
Well, actually,

30:56.088 --> 30:58.757
I'm a new love.
I mean...

30:59.558 --> 31:03.029
I'm a grandma
with an ex-husband and...

31:03.129 --> 31:05.597
and my own business,
and yet, you know,

31:05.697 --> 31:09.101
this morning I changed
my clothes three times

31:09.201 --> 31:10.636
before I ended up with this.

31:10.736 --> 31:11.737
I mean, I was just like

31:11.837 --> 31:14.840
a breathless teenager.

31:15.841 --> 31:18.344
Um, Rosanna,

31:18.444 --> 31:21.047
Oscar, he...

31:22.548 --> 31:24.783
In the ambulance,

31:24.883 --> 31:26.752
he went into cardiac arrest,

31:26.852 --> 31:28.420
and they-they...

31:28.520 --> 31:32.291
they worked on him
for 45 minutes,

31:32.391 --> 31:34.060
but he...

31:35.794 --> 31:37.496
I'm so sorry.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.165
Oscar died.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.732
Oscar.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.135
My Oscar died?

31:46.238 --> 31:47.639
We were going to go fishing.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.075
I... Oh, no.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.577
I'm so sorry.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.152
I'm so sorry.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.429
Lonnegan! Troy!
Beck!

32:10.529 --> 32:11.964
Beck!
Hey!

32:12.064 --> 32:13.665
Beck!
Man, Cap thought you escaped.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.434
We were trying to help
Santino and his family!

32:15.534 --> 32:17.769
Where's Lonnegan?
Where's Santino?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.638
Over there!
They're in there!

32:19.738 --> 32:22.674
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Oh, man.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.313
He's in there!
Hey!

32:27.413 --> 32:29.381
My son! My son!
Hey, what's...

32:29.481 --> 32:30.482
Let me go!

32:30.582 --> 32:31.783
You have to save my son.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.419
Where? Where?
The bedroom.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.854
Get him...
Lonnegan, get him back!
Hey!

32:35.954 --> 32:37.356
We can't get to him
through that hallway.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.790
We're not going
through the hallway.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.192
Man, I really don't want to die

32:40.292 --> 32:41.460
two days before my wedding.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.696
Like you said earlier,
go big and go home.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.851
Yeah!

33:05.951 --> 33:08.520
Come on, B,
get it!

33:11.890 --> 33:14.026
You got him, B?
Come on. Come on, let's go.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.761
We got to go, come on.
Yeah, come on, let's go.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.430
Here we go, here we go.
Head down, head down.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.731
Here's your dad.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.200

Move quick, now.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.838
Aw, Bode.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.640
That fire doesn't have
any walls to bust down.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.008
We're trapped.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.378
We may not have water,
but we have wine.
