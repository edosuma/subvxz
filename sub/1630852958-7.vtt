WEBVTT

00:05.959 --> 00:06.959
[beeping]

00:06.959 --> 00:13.167
Thirty-one knots.

00:13.167 --> 00:15.375
Tom dropped the ball big time.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.792
This is why I'm not into,
like, guys my age.

00:17.792 --> 00:19.250
I just wish I hadn't,
like, slept with him,

00:19.250 --> 00:20.918
because now I feel weird.

00:20.918 --> 00:22.250
You've got a boyfriend.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.876
I ----ed up and I'm gonna admit
I ----ed up.

00:23.876 --> 00:28.000
Is this the biggest [bleep] you
to my sh--ty day?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.959
You're a ----ing sket...

00:31.959 --> 00:33.375
You're looking very pretty.

00:33.375 --> 00:34.250
I know.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.626
I'm going to bed.

00:35.626 --> 00:36.959
It's my bed now.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.959
-Good night.
-Okay, wow.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.209
Ugh!

00:41.209 --> 00:45.626
Are you coming to sleep
in here or not?

00:45.626 --> 00:47.792
Primary charter guest,
Jim Blumenthal.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.959
Cannot wait to
experience sailing in Menorca

00:49.959 --> 00:51.667
with his girlfriend
and close friends.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.876
And the guests are requesting
a night in Spain dinner party

00:54.876 --> 00:56.709
with traditional local dishes.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.501
-We're on a roll.
-We are on a roll.

00:58.501 --> 01:00.834
I mean, except
for yesterday morning.

01:00.834 --> 01:04.042
I wanna prove to you on
this charter that I should stay.

01:04.042 --> 01:06.626
I need people that I can trust,
whatever it is.

01:06.626 --> 01:07.959
Yeah.

01:07.959 --> 01:09.959
If I put him back on
anchor watch

01:09.959 --> 01:36.959
and it happens again,
I'm ----ed.

01:36.959 --> 01:40.417
I feel stress that this boat's
not gonna look perfect.

01:40.417 --> 01:41.959
Looks good.

01:41.959 --> 01:45.584
All done.

01:45.584 --> 01:46.959
Perfect.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.417
I'm looking forward to
this charter.

01:48.417 --> 01:49.292
I was excited.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.334
I'm a bit nervous now.

01:51.334 --> 01:54.334
I thought the anchor
situation was, like,

01:54.334 --> 01:57.709
wrapped up by having the meeting
and the chat, and what...

01:57.709 --> 01:59.125
I don't know,
it doesn't sound like.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.709
In what sense?

02:01.709 --> 02:09.459
Kind of brought it back up
again and just said...

02:09.459 --> 02:11.834
Mm-hmm.

02:11.834 --> 02:13.501
Look, I've been going
through, like, a lot,

02:13.501 --> 02:15.292
but I've never had
to deal with this before,

02:15.292 --> 02:22.167
so I'm just learning.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.584
All crew, all crew, everyone
in the cockpit, please.

02:25.584 --> 02:29.334
-Can you pour champagne, please?
-Yeah.

02:29.334 --> 02:31.167
-Here they come.
-I
'm excited.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.250
That is a big boat.
My God, that thing is beautiful.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.959
Eyes on the prize, guys.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.417
-Well, hello!
-Hello!

02:36.417 --> 02:38.959
-Hi.
-Imagine meeting you here.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.250
-Are you Jim?
-I'm Jim.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.751
I'm Captain Glenn,
nice to meet you.

02:41.751 --> 02:43.125
-Nice to meet you, Glenn.
-Welcome to Menorca.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.584
-This is Daisy.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

02:44.584 --> 02:45.959
My hands are sweaty.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.584
-You ready to sail?
-Absolutely.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.334
-Tom, nice to meet you.
-Hi. Ashley.

02:49.334 --> 02:50.918
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

02:50.918 --> 02:52.667
Marco, Ken.

02:52.667 --> 02:55.417
Well, welcome. I'd like
to welcome you all to Menorca.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.250
Hang on, that's my line,
that's my line.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.167
Yeah, I wanna formally
welcome you guys all on board.

02:59.167 --> 03:00.751
I'm just gonna hand
you over to Daisy.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.959
She's gonna take you for
a little tour of the boat.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.292
-Outstanding.
-All right?

03:04.292 --> 03:05.542
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

03:05.542 --> 03:06.542
-Cheers.
-Salud!

03:06.542 --> 03:07.459
Nice.

03:07.459 --> 03:09.000
-Do you wanna follow me?
-We would love to.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.959
So, up here we
have the sun deck,

03:10.959 --> 03:12.626
the bunny pad,
the Jacuzzi.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.792
It's like a little area
for lounging.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.292
Topless only.

03:16.292 --> 03:18.584
-I said "topless," not "tapas."
-Tapas!

03:18.584 --> 03:20.334
Then you obviously have
the main saloon here.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.709
This is a nice area to cool down
in, have pre-dinner drinks.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.626
-You got it?
-Ooh, baby, she's a heavy one.

03:26.626 --> 03:28.542
This is the master cabin.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.959
This is nice and big
and nice and cool.

03:30.959 --> 03:32.584
I think we're all sharing.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.000
I think it's probably big enough
for all of these people.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.375
-Yeah, it is, right?
-To be fair.

03:35.375 --> 03:38.792
Okay, that's creepy,
but all right.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.375
And then we have
two twin cabins.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.584
-Wanna take this one?
-Yeah, we'll take that one.

03:42.584 --> 03:43.375
All good.

03:43.375 --> 03:44.709
We're moving shortly.

03:44.709 --> 03:46.876
-Are we gonna sail?
-No, not enough breeze.

03:46.876 --> 03:48.125
All right.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.792
-Dinner, will we say 9:00?
-Perfect.

03:49.792 --> 03:54.375
And then tomorrow night you guys
are having a seafood-palooza,

03:54.375 --> 03:55.959
followed by a talent show.

03:55.959 --> 04:00.167
Guests request a talent show,
put on by the yacht crew.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.584
But I can tell you in advance...

04:02.584 --> 04:03.375
Woo!

04:03.375 --> 04:05.167
We are a pretty
talentless bunch.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.834
It's frustrating
when we're asked requests

04:06.834 --> 04:09.042
like a talent show, because
I don't have ----ing time

04:09.042 --> 04:10.459
to think of a bloody talent.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.042
Pretty much the only thing
I'm good at is

04:12.042 --> 04:13.626
getting tan and
drinking margaritas.

04:13.626 --> 04:15.292
Let's get this party
on the road.

04:15.292 --> 04:17.751
And so we'll do stern, bow,
operating spring,

04:17.751 --> 04:23.250
-which is loose.
-Perfect.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.292
That is the most
sophisticated sail control

04:26.292 --> 04:29.000
I've ever seen, I mean...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.417
Every... he has...

04:30.417 --> 04:31.626
[laughing]

04:31.626 --> 04:34.459
That's all lines clear.

04:34.459 --> 04:37.334
There you go, turn it up.
Turn it up, love.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.375
Ken, find some wind, let's go.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.417
All right!

04:40.417 --> 04:42.334
I almost patted your butt,
I thought it was her.

04:42.334 --> 04:43.792
So, you got really lucky.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.167
Or unlucky, depending
on how you look at it.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.876
Unlucky.
Come on, Monica.

04:46.876 --> 04:48.375
There ya go.
There ya go.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.584
Aw!

04:49.584 --> 04:51.375
I spoke to her.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.584
I mean, I've kind of felt
like when I apologized to her,

04:53.584 --> 04:55.834
maybe she was gonna give
a small apology to me.

04:55.834 --> 04:59.125
But she likes to be
the victim of things, so...

04:59.125 --> 05:00.459
We're working on
the same boat together.

05:00.459 --> 05:07.459
-It's a small ----ing space.
-It is.

05:07.459 --> 05:08.334
[bleep]

05:08.334 --> 05:10.042
-Tom?
-Yes?

05:10.042 --> 05:13.417
Can you go out and
look at the port side?

05:13.417 --> 05:15.959
Port side of the house,
the railing, the windows.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.292
Yeah, I have done, Gary said.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.792
Have you...
is it done?

05:19.792 --> 05:20.792
No, no, no.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.167
Do you want me to go now, yeah?

05:22.167 --> 05:25.959
Go out and look at it.

05:25.959 --> 05:30.209
Ah.

05:30.209 --> 05:31.501
Hey, Kel, so
you're gonna go down?

05:31.501 --> 05:32.792
-Yeah.
-And I'll see you at 10:00.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.667
10:00 p.m.?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.959
Are we on lates together?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.959
Yay!

05:37.959 --> 05:39.542
You cool up here
for another 30 minutes?

05:39.542 --> 05:40.626
Yeah, man.

05:40.626 --> 05:41.584
You're so annoying.

05:41.584 --> 05:43.375
You and Gabriela are,
like, a thing now.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.042
I offered you a threesome.
You said no.

05:45.042 --> 05:47.667
I will not be having
any threesomes with her.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.375
Oh, is that jealousy
I hear in your voice?

05:49.375 --> 05:51.250
No, I'm not gonna get...
I don't get jealous.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.292
I thought you guys
sorted your stuff out.

05:53.292 --> 05:53.959
We have.

05:53.959 --> 05:57.918
So, are you girls friends now?

05:57.918 --> 06:03.876
[laughing]

06:03.876 --> 06:11.751
Oh, shut up.

06:11.751 --> 06:13.959
...and it wasn't until
about an hour after that.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.792
I don't get it.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.959
If I were Tom, I would
be working my ass off.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.792
He doesn't even seem fazed.

06:20.792 --> 06:24.792
Like, pick up a chamois,
get to work, do something.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.584
Prove your value.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.125
Kind of tipping in.

06:28.125 --> 06:32.459
Your knees were kinda like...

06:32.459 --> 06:33.459
Yep.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.042
Oh, he wanna sh--
up my life.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.417
Ah!

06:37.417 --> 06:39.083
Dead ahead looks all clear.

06:39.083 --> 06:42.501
Let her go now,
you can let her go.

06:42.501 --> 06:43.667
You're welcome.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.125
Girls, do you mind changing
into your blacks, please?

06:46.125 --> 06:49.042
-Copy.
-We need a wardrobe change.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.292
That's two shots
at the waterline.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.375
-I'm coming.
-[laughing]

06:53.375 --> 06:55.125
Colin, that looked
like a really good bite.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.584
-We're done, thanks, mate.
-Copy that.

06:58.584 --> 07:02.083
I'm gonna go start pulling
a few things for the table.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.834
Yeah, I think the flybridge
might be nice.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.667
Yeah, and then I'll pull
all the table stuff.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.125
And I think it'll
be a bit cooler,

07:07.125 --> 07:09.834
because dinner's
gonna be at 9:00.

07:09.834 --> 07:17.542
Ah.

07:17.542 --> 07:18.584
I'm struggling.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.459
You're not struggling,
this looks beautiful.

07:20.459 --> 07:21.834
I don't wanna put too
much stuff on the table.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.501
This looks great.

07:23.501 --> 07:27.834
I'm just really having,
like, horny problems.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.000
-Well, that's easy...
-And they're not gonna go away.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.042
That's easily solved, I think.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.626
No, it's not.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.792
All of these forks are
different sizes, by the way.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.584
-Do you need a hand up here?
-I don't really know.

07:37.584 --> 07:38.751
Should I just provide your
entertainment for the evening?

07:38.751 --> 07:40.209
Yeah.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.792
Just because I've got
such a nice personality,

07:41.792 --> 07:44.584
you guys are, like...
I'm like a magnet to you.

07:44.584 --> 07:47.459
No, I'm... no.

07:47.459 --> 07:49.876
I know you are,
so don't kiss me again.

07:49.876 --> 07:51.083
So, now we've all kissed you?

07:51.083 --> 07:52.959
-No.
-Except Kelsie.

07:52.959 --> 07:54.501
Yeah, yes...
wait, say that again.

07:54.501 --> 07:55.209
Jesus Christ!

07:55.209 --> 07:56.876
You've all kissed me... exactly.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.375
-Exactly.
-Yeah!

07:58.375 --> 08:00.626
This whole
Gabriela-Gary situation

08:00.626 --> 08:02.375
is ----ing frustrating.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.542
Like, I could have
----ed Gary already.

08:03.542 --> 08:04.959
I could have done it already.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.584
-No one ever saw that for sure.
-----ed.

08:06.584 --> 08:07.334
No, me neither.

08:07.334 --> 08:08.667
Whatever, Gabriela.

08:08.667 --> 08:12.542
I don't usually lose,
so good luck.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.459
There's something
in the water on this boat.

08:14.459 --> 08:17.083
-Yeah.
-[phone rings]

08:17.083 --> 08:18.334
Yeah, my name is Glenn.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.000
I'm calling from
the Parsifal III.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.918
I'm looking for a deckhand, and
I need somebody pretty soon.

08:22.918 --> 08:24.501
Okay, I'll see what we can do.

08:24.501 --> 08:26.167
-Thank you very much.
-Bye-bye.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.667
I've given it a couple days,

08:28.667 --> 08:32.042
and what's happened since
hasn't convinced me

08:32.042 --> 08:37.626
that it was a one-off
[bleep] up.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.626
Mm-mm.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.167
No, don't get me wrong,
I like the guy.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.626
But what else is
he gonna do wrong

08:42.626 --> 08:45.959
if that was his
judgment on that?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.667
It's a good point.

08:47.667 --> 08:51.042
He's still distracted,
and on top of that,

08:51.042 --> 08:53.792
it hasn't really sunk in

08:53.792 --> 09:02.417
how serious that was,
and that's scary.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.250
Coming up...

09:03.250 --> 09:05.000
It took us quite
a long time to drag.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.542
That is not myself.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.918
I've been going through
some things, as you know.

09:08.918 --> 09:10.959
The whole point of
anchor watch

09:10.959 --> 09:13.834
is precisely to make sure
that doesn't happen.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.501
And later...

09:15.501 --> 09:19.167
Ladies and gentlemen, our very
own Gary "The Ladykiller" King!

09:19.167 --> 09:20.542
-Yeah!
-Ah!

09:20.542 --> 09:29.375
Oh, my God!

09:29.375 --> 09:31.000
They're not seated yet, right?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.834
No, they're not.

09:32.834 --> 09:33.959
Get yourself ready.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.167
You look beautiful.

09:35.167 --> 09:40.709
Thanks, baby.

09:40.709 --> 09:45.042
Damn, I wish I could
take my photos.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.375
-Beautiful.
-Oh, my God, look at this.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.375
Marvelous, look at that,
look at that.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.709
Ah, the matador is here.

09:50.709 --> 09:51.959
[trill tongue]

09:51.959 --> 09:53.209
Ha!

09:53.209 --> 09:57.167
Juan Carlos España,
at your service.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.042
Dear baby Jesus.

09:59.042 --> 10:00.792
Somebody said it
was Spanish night.

10:00.792 --> 10:01.959
It is, I love it.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.667
Tony, you went all out.

10:03.667 --> 10:10.834
I expect you to wear that the
rest of the trip, I'm impressed.

10:10.834 --> 10:11.959
I mean, that is...

10:11.959 --> 10:13.834
-This is real polyester.
-I have respect.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.667
[laughing]

10:15.667 --> 10:17.959
That sunset is so amazing.

10:17.959 --> 10:20.250
Guests are seated and
wine service is done.

10:20.250 --> 10:24.417
-Okay, Marcos, we're ready.
-Una momenta.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.292
I think you can go to bed, brü.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.584
-Are you coming up, Marcos?
-Yeah.

10:27.584 --> 10:28.918
Okay, vamos.

10:28.918 --> 10:30.292
Keep it together.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.292
You just go to the far, far end;
I'll go middle.

10:32.292 --> 10:33.417
Okay.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.125
To a wonderful Spanish evening.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.125
-Look at this.
-Oh, yeah.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.459
-Olé!
-Olé, olé!

10:39.459 --> 10:41.459
We have traditional octopus,

10:41.459 --> 10:44.000
and I did a twist, with
a spicy aioli.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.167
Enjoy, guys.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.959
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

10:46.959 --> 10:48.459
That is delicious.

10:48.459 --> 10:50.709
It is so spicy,
but it's...

10:50.709 --> 10:52.000
In a fantastic way.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.042
Can we get him
to come home with us?

10:54.042 --> 10:55.042
Okay.

10:55.042 --> 11:03.751
Thank you so much.

11:03.751 --> 11:05.459
All eaten.

11:05.459 --> 11:06.751
They said it was delicious.

11:06.751 --> 11:12.959
Thank you.

11:12.959 --> 11:14.250
No, never would she do that.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.292
Gabriela, the service
is excellent.

11:15.292 --> 11:17.292
-Thank you!
-So good.

11:17.292 --> 11:18.584
-Hello!
-Hey, how are you?

11:18.584 --> 11:19.584
Good, how are you?

11:19.584 --> 11:20.709
Did you get some sleep?

11:20.709 --> 11:22.209
-I did.
-Good for you.

11:22.209 --> 11:23.792
I'm feeling ready for the night.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.209
Good.

11:25.209 --> 11:28.584
-Vamanos!
-Come on, let's go, let's go.

11:28.584 --> 11:29.542
Wow, I love lamb.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.751
So, for you guys we have,
like, lamb stew.

11:31.751 --> 11:35.042
It has some mushrooms,
white wine vinegar,

11:35.042 --> 11:36.292
cooked for four hours.

11:36.292 --> 11:38.959
All right, guys, enjoy it.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.918
I think he's got some skills.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pervert.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.125
Will you just do laundry
for 15 minutes,

11:46.125 --> 11:47.792
and then you can go to bed.

11:47.792 --> 12:13.959
You just wake up at half-six.

12:13.959 --> 12:18.709
Okay, let's go.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.167
That is beautiful as well.

12:20.167 --> 12:23.459
We have a butternut squash
tart, super famous here.

12:23.459 --> 12:25.709
-It's amazing.
-Gracias!

12:25.709 --> 12:30.167
Mm! Mm!

12:30.167 --> 12:35.375
Do you mind, I'm trying
to do dishes here.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.834
-Hooters!
-Guess... no.

12:36.834 --> 12:37.959
Give a real guess.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.125
Definitely not, Jim.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.626
Give a real...
do you guys know?

12:40.626 --> 12:41.626
Wait, wait...

12:41.626 --> 12:44.959
Chris has the answer.

12:44.959 --> 12:47.792
He gave you the shocker
at the gym?

12:47.792 --> 12:49.667
I'm so sorry.

12:49.667 --> 12:55.125
You're stuck with me, and you
should be compensated fairly.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.792
The only thing
that's gonna stretch

12:56.792 --> 12:58.209
that out is a stronger wind.

12:58.209 --> 12:59.584
-Strong wind, yeah.
-So, she should come and get us.

12:59.584 --> 13:01.751
-Exactly.
-So, let's explain this to her.

13:01.751 --> 13:03.125
Yeah.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.125
I don't know if this
----ing anchor watch

13:04.125 --> 13:05.125
is gonna do anything.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.000
The meal was unbelievable.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.292
Is it time for bed?

13:08.292 --> 13:11.918
-Kelsie, do you wanna come up?
-Yep.

13:11.918 --> 13:15.167
What happened the other day
has never happened to me before.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.334
And I know you've got
jobs to do tonight,

13:17.334 --> 13:20.709
but your most important
job is this.

13:20.709 --> 13:22.000
Critical...

13:22.000 --> 13:24.167
Any question, like should
I get them up,

13:24.167 --> 13:26.250
the moment you think that,
come and get us up.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.959
If we get anywhere near
the lines

13:27.959 --> 13:29.209
that I've drawn you, that...

13:29.209 --> 13:30.626
Yeah, like... exactly.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.000
Everyone, I think, is
still a little shook

13:33.000 --> 13:34.626
from running aground,

13:34.626 --> 13:38.584
so I was totally expecting
a very thorough walkthrough.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.751
But I know my duties
on night watch...

13:40.751 --> 13:43.584
me and the stars,
and the sunrises.

13:43.584 --> 13:45.125
I'm nervous because
of what's happened.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.626
-Of what happened, yeah.
-Eh?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.626
-Well, you can count on me.
-That cannot happen.

13:48.626 --> 13:50.375
Glenn, I got it...

13:50.375 --> 13:52.167
wake you up if
I'm unsure about anything.

13:52.167 --> 13:54.042
Roger, copy.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.125
-Okay.
-Nope, it won't.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.334
Good.

13:56.334 --> 13:57.375
All right,
see you guys tomorrow.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.459
We're gonna go to bed, too.

13:58.459 --> 14:00.167
Good night.
Sleep well.

14:00.167 --> 14:09.751
-Cheers, thank you.
-Good night.

14:09.751 --> 14:11.751
No, not mine.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.167
Mm!

14:13.167 --> 14:27.125
[laughing]

14:27.125 --> 14:29.292
There's five knots of wind,

14:29.292 --> 14:38.292
so there are some rocks
that come within the line.

14:38.292 --> 14:39.501
I'll be up now.

14:39.501 --> 14:41.667
It's not fun to
wake the boss up,

14:41.667 --> 14:50.501
but I'd rather wake the boss up
than disobey the boss.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.792
Thank God nothing's
happening, the boat's fine.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.167
I'm happy Kelsie,

14:54.167 --> 14:55.459
she's got the confidence
to come and wake me up.

14:55.459 --> 15:03.876
She understands
what's required of her.

They're not seated yet, right?

Okay, Tom, you know,
I've had a little bit of time

18:19.584 --> 18:23.167
to think about this,
and it's quite clear

18:23.167 --> 18:27.459
that it took us quite
a long time to drag.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.918

To me, it's impossible, it's...

18:34.250 --> 18:37.959
The whole point of anchor
watch is precisely

18:37.959 --> 18:39.584
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

18:39.584 --> 18:41.876
And I feel bad, and I
have no pleasure in this,

18:41.876 --> 18:44.250
but you know, the more
I think about it...

18:44.250 --> 18:45.918
It's okay, don't worry
about it, Glenn.

18:45.918 --> 18:49.792
Yeah, I have to let you go.
I got no choice.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.751
Just let me say it while
I'm here in front of you.

18:51.751 --> 18:52.959
That is not myself.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.751

things, as you know, that...

18:55.751 --> 18:56.876
I know that.

18:56.876 --> 18:59.375
And that really did affect me
in what's going on.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.167
I understand that.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.209
It's really clear to me that
Tom's mind is in another place.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.584
So, it's not like we can
just let him stay

19:05.584 --> 19:07.292
because he can't do any harm.

19:07.292 --> 19:10.250
He can still do harm
in that mindset.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.584
We're not here
to provide a job for Tom.

19:12.584 --> 19:16.125

have worked out better.

an hour, hour and a half.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.501
Yeah, you have to,
yeah, yeah.

20:00.501 --> 20:10.876
Yeah.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.501
Gary, Daisy, and Colin,

20:13.501 --> 20:15.751
can you guys meet me up
in the wheelhouse?

20:15.751 --> 20:17.751
Copy that, on my way.

20:17.751 --> 20:19.542
-Hi, Tom.
-H
i, Mum.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.959
-How are you?
-B
een better.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.375
I have to leave, basically.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.876
I'm not allowed to stay.

20:23.876 --> 20:26.209
It's too big of an incident
to sort of ignore.

20:26.209 --> 20:29.918
-It was, you know...
-Oh.

20:29.918 --> 20:33.083
Yeah, I'm...

20:33.083 --> 20:35.417
Yeah.

20:35.417 --> 20:38.167
I just wanted to have a quick
word with you guys about Tom.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.417
If there was a way I could
keep him I would have,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.959
but I can't trust him,
and we just can't afford

20:42.959 --> 20:46.334
to have somebody on board
that we can't trust.

20:46.334 --> 20:49.167
We are gonna be
a little bit short.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.834
Now, I hope to
get his replacement

20:50.834 --> 20:52.167
on before the next charter.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.584
In the meantime, Colin,
if I could ask you

20:54.584 --> 20:56.375
to help out a little
bit more on deck,

20:56.375 --> 20:58.751
and then you can take up
some of Tom's slack.

20:58.751 --> 20:59.959
Okay, we can make it work.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.959
Yeah, we're all just gonna
have to chip in, all righty?

21:01.959 --> 21:03.334
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

21:03.334 --> 21:08.709
Cool

21:08.709 --> 21:11.375
Let's get ready
to rumble on the watersports

21:11.375 --> 21:20.000
I wanna do that.
They have, like, a float.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.375
-Hello.
-Hi.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.000
I hope you don't hold
any hard feelings.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.167
No, we're good.

21:27.167 --> 21:29.000
I know. I know.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.375
We've literally loved and hated
each other this whole trip.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.209
I hope that we can be
friends one day properly.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.292
You know, I hope
we can look back at this

21:35.292 --> 21:36.792
and just laugh at it.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.709
I am gonna miss you,
but it's just, like,

21:38.709 --> 21:41.834
I feel like this is probably,
like, the best thing.

21:41.834 --> 21:45.501
I have learned to never
have sex with a woman

21:45.501 --> 21:48.667
who wants to have sex
with your boss.

21:48.667 --> 21:52.167
-All right, thanks, Ashley.
-Bye, hon.

21:52.167 --> 21:59.417
This could be
Tom's ride coming now.

21:59.417 --> 22:02.918
No!

22:02.918 --> 22:04.000
-Love you, man.
-Love you.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.918
Take it easy.

22:06.918 --> 22:08.959
I didn't wanna let anyone
down on the crew,

22:08.959 --> 22:12.167
but I've just been up and down
like a yo-yo, like, constantly.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.792
I'm actually leaving the boat,

22:13.792 --> 22:15.125
just for some stuff
going on back home.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.083
-Oh, that makes us sad.
-Oh!

22:17.083 --> 22:18.167
-Boom.
-Take care of you.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.876
-Yeah.
-You take care of you.

22:19.876 --> 22:21.375
Good luck with everything.

22:21.375 --> 22:24.792
But definitely need to listen
to people more and to...

22:24.792 --> 22:27.125
not to act on my emotions.

22:27.125 --> 22:28.125
-It's been real, bro.
-Take care, man.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.375
I will.

22:29.375 --> 22:30.667
Look after yourself,
keep in touch.

22:30.667 --> 22:35.876
But it's time for me
to say goodbye.

22:35.876 --> 22:39.167
Well, that was unexpected.
That's sad.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.876
Really good life lesson for him.

22:40.876 --> 22:46.417
Big time.

22:46.417 --> 22:48.501
What do I do, what did I miss,
what's happening?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.501
-Feel so out of the loop.
-Jesus...

22:50.501 --> 22:51.918
All right, so, Tom's left.

22:51.918 --> 22:53.375
Yeah, just learned that.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.375
You can go down, if you want.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.918
Come up at 11:00.

22:56.918 --> 23:03.042
Aw, bye, Tom.

23:03.042 --> 23:04.751
We should have somebody by...

23:04.751 --> 23:08.542
by next charter, we should
have the full replacement.

23:08.542 --> 23:11.167
-Are you sad?
-Sad?

23:11.167 --> 23:12.417
I mean, I got a little,
like, teary-eyed.

23:12.417 --> 23:14.334
I mean, I don't, like...

23:14.334 --> 23:15.792
Yeah, we don't want
nobody to go.

23:15.792 --> 23:18.584
Well, let's see
how's the new boy.

23:18.584 --> 23:21.167
I ----ing hope it's someone
that Kelsie likes,

23:21.167 --> 23:23.542
someone that Gabriela likes.

23:23.542 --> 23:29.334
I'm done.

23:29.334 --> 23:30.542
We gotta work together
on this, then.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.542
Yeah, I know.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.000
I can jump in wherever.
What about the watches?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.209
Kelsie's on nights now anyway,

23:35.209 --> 23:36.667
so if you help me out
in the day,

23:36.667 --> 23:39.792
Even if I can make you have
a break during the day,

23:39.792 --> 23:48.083
put a chamois in my hand.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.542
Gary, we're gonna fire up.

23:49.542 --> 23:50.959
I'm gonna go change my shirt.

23:50.959 --> 23:58.000
You can start picking up.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.501
Anchor's home, anchor's home.

23:59.501 --> 24:01.125
Copy, anchor home, thanks.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.501
This is a good breeze, eh?

24:03.501 --> 24:06.375
Now that Tom's off the boat,
I really wanna get things

24:06.375 --> 24:08.167
back to normal as quickly
as possible

24:08.167 --> 24:10.292
to lighten the mood and
focus on making sure

24:10.292 --> 24:12.209
the guests have
the best experience possible.

24:12.209 --> 24:15.584
Gary, can you pitch up?
I'm gonna do the mizzen.

24:15.584 --> 24:16.709
Copy.

24:16.709 --> 24:17.584
Can I do it?

24:17.584 --> 24:19.375
I'm gonna try to
get everything away,

24:19.375 --> 24:22.959
because I'm worried we're
gonna heel hard.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.792
I feel like I kinda
know what I'm doing,

24:24.792 --> 24:25.959
but you make this look good.

24:25.959 --> 24:27.292
-Do I?
-Yeah, yeah.

24:27.292 --> 24:28.375
Well, thank you, thank you.

24:28.375 --> 24:29.959
To the deck, everyone.

24:29.959 --> 24:33.000
Let's go see what's happening
up there, I guess.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
How's that?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.167
Boom, you're there.

24:36.167 --> 24:39.375
Okay, main.

24:39.375 --> 24:40.751
Sorry it's so windy.

24:40.751 --> 24:42.000
I just moussed my hair,
I don't know

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
what you're talking about, pal.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.792
That's it, yep.

24:44.792 --> 24:47.501
-It's getting serious now.
-Let's haul out the genoas.

24:47.501 --> 24:53.083
I don't like these cabinets.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.834
And you're good.

24:54.834 --> 24:58.876
Oh!

24:58.876 --> 25:02.542
We are moving!

25:02.542 --> 25:05.584
Holy cow!

25:05.584 --> 25:07.918
Ah!

25:07.918 --> 25:09.834
Nice, I like excitement.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.167
Yeah, nice job, Colin.

25:11.167 --> 25:12.959
Dear baby Jesus.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.083
Coming up...

25:14.083 --> 25:15.584
-Ready whenever you are.
-Oh, yeah?

25:15.584 --> 25:17.209
-Yeah.
-When you told me that?

25:17.209 --> 25:19.125
I thought Gabriela
came down and told you?

25:19.125 --> 25:20.876
Where's our food?

25:20.876 --> 25:20.876
Oh, ----ing..

25:20.876 --> 25:29.417
Okay, Tom, you know,
I've had a little bit of time

25:29.417 --> 25:36.501
Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.876
[bleep] me!

25:38.876 --> 25:40.375
That's what we
should be doing, is, like,

25:40.375 --> 25:42.042
a pots-and-pans band
for our talent show.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.375
I can do that.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.709
Yeah, but that's
what we should be doing.

25:45.709 --> 25:48.709
See, that would be fun.

25:48.709 --> 25:50.584
Gary, if you want, we'll put
that lazy sheet away now.

25:50.584 --> 25:51.584
Okay, copy.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.959
Well, Ken, I guess you
could call the mizzen.

25:53.959 --> 25:59.667
Yes, sir.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.083
Good.

26:01.083 --> 26:05.459
We're gonna go to four.

26:05.459 --> 26:07.375
That's four shots, four shots.

26:07.375 --> 26:11.167
-Copy, thanks, mate.
-Whew, okay.

26:11.167 --> 26:12.709
Dinner is at 9:00.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.167
You're on dinner
service tonight.

26:14.167 --> 26:15.918
Cool.

26:15.918 --> 26:18.375
I don't know what to do about
this ----ing talent show.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.959
You know I used to be a
professional dancer, right?

26:20.959 --> 26:22.209
What kind of dancing did you do?

26:22.209 --> 26:23.751
-Samba and salsa.
-Oh, cool.

26:23.751 --> 26:25.125
That would be good.

26:25.125 --> 26:28.042
I grew up dancing salsa
since I was, like, five,

26:28.042 --> 26:29.626
so I was born for this.

26:29.626 --> 26:32.334
When I first moved to L.A.,
I ended up getting picked up

26:32.334 --> 26:34.209
on a professional samba team,

26:34.209 --> 26:35.834
and my instructor asked me
to assist him

26:35.834 --> 26:38.792
on his private salsa
lessons with celebrities.

26:38.792 --> 26:40.083
So, I got this.

26:40.083 --> 26:43.292
Ahh... yeah.

26:43.292 --> 26:44.334
I think they would love that.

26:44.334 --> 26:45.501
Yeah, they would.

26:45.501 --> 26:47.417
You wanna brainstorm ideas?

26:47.417 --> 26:51.000
Does any of us have
any talent? You.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.209
Zero.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.125
You do play guitar.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.876
So, Daisy and
the girls dance.

26:55.876 --> 26:57.959
You're the headlining act,
with a...

26:57.959 --> 26:59.751
-Yeah, I'm...
-He's gonna tell a joke.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.584
-That's gonna be the highlight.
-Highlight.

27:02.584 --> 27:05.167
Say, hey, guys, we're all
gonna do a 20-second slot.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.834
So, this is all you get.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.459
Everyone can laugh and applaud,
then we move to the next one.

27:08.459 --> 27:10.792
That's it, done.
Easy-peasy.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.709
Okay, the tender's good.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.459
That's about it,
isn't it?

27:14.459 --> 27:15.834
All right, what do
you kids wanna do?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.584
-Let's pull out the...
-Water stuff?

27:17.584 --> 27:20.792
-Yeah, let's go, water toys.
-Water stuff? Okay.

27:20.792 --> 27:24.167
All right.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.209
Okay, are we gonna
blow up some stuff?

27:25.209 --> 27:26.542
Yeah, you are.

27:26.542 --> 27:27.751
Yeah, we need to blow
up a sailboat.

27:27.751 --> 27:28.959
I don't know where
everybody went.

27:28.959 --> 27:31.000
Whew, okay.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Half an hour nap.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.792
They should never leave us
in charge, because...

27:35.792 --> 27:37.375
I know.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.292
we're just gonna come down
and screw some sh-- up.

27:39.292 --> 27:42.584
I bet this is their,
like, worst nightmare.

27:42.584 --> 27:45.375
[snoring]

27:45.375 --> 27:46.751
-Oh!
-Can I get anyone anything?

27:46.751 --> 27:48.000
Can I jump off the side here?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.834
-Is Gary there?
-No, nobody's there.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.334
-Oh, okay, you guys are just...
-Should I wait?

27:51.334 --> 27:55.250
No... no, you can go,
I'll stay here.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.959
Gary, Gary, Daisy.

27:58.959 --> 28:01.250
Yeah, Dais, go ahead.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.375
Hey, I'm just on
the swim platform.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.834
The guests are about
to go swimming.

28:04.834 --> 28:08.250
I can wait here until
you're ready.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.792
On my way.

28:09.792 --> 28:10.959
So, you promise Gary
and Colin will not get mad

28:10.959 --> 28:12.417
at me if I jump?

28:12.417 --> 28:14.167
I promise you, I will take
full responsibility.

28:14.167 --> 28:15.959
You can see all the witnesses.

28:15.959 --> 28:20.083
I mean, there are ----ing
how many other people up?

28:20.083 --> 28:22.584
I hate my life.

28:22.584 --> 28:25.584
Whew!

28:25.584 --> 28:26.667
Good job.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.417
Whew, [bleep].
We need a deckie.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.834
You guys are jumping
over the side.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.417
They were like, "Are you
sure I can jump off?"

28:33.417 --> 28:34.792
I'm like, "You are allowed
to jump off."

28:34.792 --> 28:36.918
Daisy said...
Daisy said I could do it!

28:36.918 --> 28:38.083
Oh, you're in big trouble, mate!

28:38.083 --> 28:39.209
You're such a rat!

28:39.209 --> 28:40.375
You're in big trouble!

28:40.375 --> 28:41.918
We do have kayaks also,

28:41.918 --> 28:43.709
and there's some nice caves
to look at in there.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.042
I don't know if that's
your guys' fancy.

28:45.042 --> 28:51.959
-Ooh, yeah.
-Yeah!

28:51.959 --> 28:53.542
[bleep] really?

28:53.542 --> 28:54.959
I mean, I'm used to hard work,

28:54.959 --> 28:57.375
don't get me wrong,
but being a man down

28:57.375 --> 28:58.959
----ing sucks, you know?

28:58.959 --> 29:01.000
Kelsie's working at night,
so she's sleeping.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.459
It's like, [bleep] you need
that extra crewmember there

29:03.459 --> 29:05.125
just to take a bit of load off.

29:05.125 --> 29:06.417
All right, we going
on the kayak?

29:06.417 --> 29:09.375
You guys are ready to go.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.626
This is the best.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.918
What's up?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.250
That is cool.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.834
I mean, how often do
you get to sit in a cave

29:15.834 --> 29:19.083
and look at that view?

29:19.083 --> 29:20.501
-Is that dirty?
-Yeah.

29:20.501 --> 29:22.542
-Wait, fishy dirty?
-Fresh fishy.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.167
-Mm, then we'll put it in there.
-Ehh, ehh, ehh.

29:24.167 --> 29:25.792
-I smell it.
-Ehh, ehh.

29:25.792 --> 29:28.334
All crew, all crew, the guests
are on the way back.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.459
Girls, change into
your blacks, please.

29:31.459 --> 29:34.000
Ah.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.375
I've got the kayak.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.083
How were the caves, nice?

29:39.083 --> 29:43.083
-Really fun.
-Ah!

29:43.083 --> 29:44.584
Rehydration is key.

29:44.584 --> 29:48.584
I'm gonna pound a
grapefruit martini tomorrow.

29:48.584 --> 29:50.918
We still have St. Germaine
left, right?

29:50.918 --> 29:52.209
I'm doing wine tomorrow.

29:52.209 --> 29:55.167
Permission to invade.

29:55.167 --> 29:56.417
What's for dinner tonight,
my friend?

29:56.417 --> 29:58.918
We have lobster,
clams, mussels...

29:58.918 --> 30:00.292
-Oh!
-Scallops, calamari.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.876
Tonight, timing's very
important because

30:02.876 --> 30:05.334
there's gonna be a lot
of dishes, family-style.

30:05.334 --> 30:06.584
All right,
we'll see you tonight.

30:06.584 --> 30:08.375
So, we need to keep
the freshness.

30:08.375 --> 30:12.542
The mussels, clams,
lobster, scallops...

30:12.542 --> 30:15.542
there's a lot of things going
on in my galley right now.

30:15.542 --> 30:16.751
Are you okay for your music?

30:16.751 --> 30:18.000
Yeah, I'm the emcee.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.959
Sweet. Excellent.
What time we doing this?

30:19.959 --> 30:27.250
After din-din.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.584
Stunning.
Rawr.

30:29.584 --> 30:31.626
Oh, wow.

30:31.626 --> 30:33.792
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
No, get with your wife.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.459
Make sure and get the sunset.

30:35.459 --> 30:40.083
Daisy's upstairs with them.
What do you need?

30:40.083 --> 30:42.334
You have to wait until
they sit down?

30:42.334 --> 30:46.959
I don't want it to be
overcooked, you know?

30:46.959 --> 30:50.959
Are you gonna try and
kiss me again tomorrow night?

30:50.959 --> 30:52.626
And Daisy's job.

30:52.626 --> 30:56.000
You're gonna do water,
or you want me to?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.375
Okay.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.751
Isn't "Kevin" the male version
of "Karen?"

31:00.751 --> 31:02.417
No, it's actually "Chad,"
I think.

31:02.417 --> 31:10.000
Daisy's doing wine
and everyone's seated.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.667
Okay.

31:11.667 --> 31:14.584
To a great trip, to great
friends, and to our next trip.

31:14.584 --> 31:15.959
-Oh!
-Yeah!

31:15.959 --> 31:17.292
-Ooh!
-I like that.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.334
[speaking Spanish]

31:21.334 --> 31:23.209
-Ready whenever you are.
-Huh?

31:23.209 --> 31:25.167
-Ready.
-Oh, yeah?

31:25.167 --> 31:27.042
-Yeah.
-When you told me that?

31:27.042 --> 31:30.209
I thought Gabriela came down
and told you.

31:30.209 --> 31:31.584
You told me go ahead?

31:31.584 --> 31:33.375
Really, are you serious
right now?

31:33.375 --> 31:36.584
Daisy's doing wine
and everyone's seated.

31:36.584 --> 31:38.000
That's why I was standing
here staring at you.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.167
All right, all right, all right.

31:39.167 --> 31:40.667
I thought...
okay, misunderstanding.

31:40.667 --> 31:44.334
Loco, how dare you throw me
under the bus like that?

31:44.334 --> 31:47.167
I have to try to send everything
at the same time.

31:47.167 --> 31:48.667
You can ask me for,
"Oh, I need now."

31:48.667 --> 31:52.250
It's not gonna happen.
Where's our food?

31:52.250 --> 31:55.834
Raw, raw, raw, raw, raw.

31:55.834 --> 31:57.375
What the [bleep], Gabby?

31:57.375 --> 31:59.000
Bad.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.834
Ai sh--.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.584
Where's our food?

32:05.584 --> 32:07.083
I'm actually really hungry.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.459
Ai sh--.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.375
So, this is Marcos'
homemade bread.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.959
Next time, would you
like me to say "Fire?"

32:13.959 --> 32:15.584
Okay.

32:15.584 --> 32:17.959
I'm caught off-guard when
Marcos throws me under the bus

32:17.959 --> 32:21.626
right in front of
my ----ing face.

32:21.626 --> 32:23.125
Who does that?

32:23.125 --> 32:24.709
This is not my first
dinner service.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.709
Like [bleep] man.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.876
You can go with that so they can
start picking.

32:27.876 --> 32:36.083
-Shrimp tartare?
-Yeah.

32:36.083 --> 32:39.000
So, we have local
shrimp tartare.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.584
Oh, yay.

32:43.584 --> 32:45.959
-I've never had shrimp tartare.
-Neither have I.

32:45.959 --> 32:47.792
But it's really delicious.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.167
-Can I take this?
-Go.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.959
Calamari ala plancha and
scallops beurre blanc.

32:51.959 --> 32:53.000
Beurre blanc,
beurre blanc.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.626
Whatever.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.250
[trills]

32:56.250 --> 32:59.083
Scallops with beurre
blanc sauce.

32:59.083 --> 33:05.959
Yes, that is Marty's favorite.

33:05.959 --> 33:07.375
That is delicious.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.083
Keep it together.
Okay.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.792
Oh, my gosh,
this is heaven on Earth.

33:10.792 --> 33:11.584
Oh, my God, look at that.

33:11.584 --> 33:13.751
-Marcos, this is...
-Oh, my God.

33:13.751 --> 33:15.042
The paella, baby.

33:15.042 --> 33:16.834
This is calamari
and chorizo rice.

33:16.834 --> 33:18.667
Ooh!

33:18.667 --> 33:19.751
I love you, Marcos.

33:19.751 --> 33:21.083
Have you tried the
scallops yet?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.459
Yeah, the scallops
are amazing.

33:22.459 --> 33:27.417
Ah, okay,
so, I'm gonna tell some jokes.

33:27.417 --> 33:28.417
What?

33:28.417 --> 33:33.375
I'm used to hearing,
like, "fire," go ahead.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.751
Oh, they're sitting,
drinking wine.

33:35.751 --> 33:38.667
She just keep talking,
and I didn't get it.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.417
Okay.

33:41.417 --> 33:42.918
This food is ----ing phenomenal.

33:42.918 --> 33:44.375
Thanks, bro.

33:44.375 --> 33:47.042
All crew, all crew, can everyone
come to the crew mess?

33:47.042 --> 33:51.959
Oh sh--.

33:51.959 --> 33:53.918
[bleep] this is embarrassing.

33:53.918 --> 33:55.459
Oh, my Lord.

33:55.459 --> 33:56.792
This talent show
better be amazing.

33:56.792 --> 33:59.959
But white could be cute, too,
if we do white.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.918
I don't like singing and
dancing in front of people.

34:01.918 --> 34:03.709
The last time I did that,

34:03.709 --> 34:06.375
I was in elementary school
and we sang

34:06.375 --> 34:07.792
"Were All in This Together,"

34:07.792 --> 34:09.542
and of course they clapped
for us at the end,

34:09.542 --> 34:11.375
because we're ----ing
six years old.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.459
Okay, let's go.

34:13.459 --> 34:14.792
Woo!

34:14.792 --> 34:16.792
[cheering]

34:16.792 --> 34:18.459
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:18.459 --> 34:21.292
welcome to tonight's
Parsifal III talent show.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.667
Believe it or not, we all
have full-time jobs,

34:23.667 --> 34:27.250
so it was a really tall order
to put this together.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.167
But we have some amazing
acts for you tonight.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.792
And our opening act,
we have

34:30.792 --> 34:34.375
the Parsifal Bombshells
performing a sexy salsa.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.792
-Yeah!
-Woo!

34:36.792 --> 34:39.375
The last time I did a
memorized dance routine

34:39.375 --> 34:42.000
was probably when the Macarena
came out in the '90s.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.334
-Hey, hey, hey!
-[clapping]

34:47.334 --> 34:48.792
I'm, like, sweating.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.751
Woo, nice!

34:50.751 --> 34:54.542
Woo!

34:54.542 --> 34:56.959
Okay, now you have to get up.

34:56.959 --> 34:58.667
It's horrible.

34:58.667 --> 35:03.167
Oh, my God!

35:03.167 --> 35:05.375
Whoa, I'd hate to go second.

35:05.375 --> 35:07.375
-Ah!
-Woo!

35:07.375 --> 35:09.083
-Vaya!
-Hey!

35:09.083 --> 35:10.792
Oh, wow.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.959
Holy catfish!

35:12.959 --> 35:13.959
Hey!

35:13.959 --> 35:21.083
[cheering]

35:21.083 --> 35:23.959
Yeah!

35:23.959 --> 35:25.584
Woo!

35:25.584 --> 35:27.375
[cheering]

35:27.375 --> 35:29.751
I just wanna talk a little bit
about my wife.

35:29.751 --> 35:30.667
Oh!

35:30.667 --> 35:32.501
I went to the doctor,
she came with me.

35:32.501 --> 35:34.501
I had a little exam, and
at the end of the exam

35:34.501 --> 35:37.292
the doctor told me
that I could touch myself

35:37.292 --> 35:39.083
whenever I feel like it.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.667
And I'm like, "Fantastic."

35:40.667 --> 35:42.375
She said, "No, that's
not what he said.

35:42.375 --> 35:44.042
"He said, 'You could have
a stroke at any time.'"

35:44.042 --> 35:45.042
Oh!

35:45.042 --> 35:47.042
[laughing]

35:47.042 --> 35:48.751
Woo!

35:48.751 --> 35:49.918
I'm not married.

36:22.250 --> 36:25.292
Okay, Jim,
you're gonna come with me.

36:25.292 --> 36:26.375
Jim, you brought
this on yourself.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.792
Yeah, he sure did.

36:28.792 --> 36:36.792

Woo-hoo!

36:53.709 --> 36:57.959
[cheering]

36:57.959 --> 37:02.959
That was unbelievable.

37:02.959 --> 37:05.292
Everyone's a winner.

37:05.292 --> 37:07.375
I'm very proud of the crew.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.626
I'm amazed.
I'm impressed, actually.

37:09.626 --> 37:09.626
I think it's way better
than I was expecting.

37:09.626 --> 37:19.334
Where's our food?

37:19.334 --> 37:21.292
That was so dang funny.

37:21.292 --> 37:23.083
Except for Gary,
that was scary.

37:23.083 --> 37:24.584
I love how we both
forgot the choreography.

37:24.584 --> 37:25.792
I know.

37:25.792 --> 37:27.584
Good night, good night,
we'll see you in the morning.

37:27.584 --> 37:31.459
Gabriela, you can go to bed
and get up for 7:00.

37:31.459 --> 37:33.000
-Be on deck at 7:00.
-Yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.417
-Okay.
-I'm exhausted.

37:34.417 --> 37:35.959
Here's your night duties.

37:35.959 --> 37:38.959
Wind picks up to 15 knots,
wake me up, or any alarm.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.083
-You dig?
-Mm-hmm.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.459
Sweet.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.584
And I'm gonna go to bed.
Are you all good?

37:43.584 --> 37:50.250
Mm-hmm.

37:50.250 --> 37:55.542
Yeah, sh--. Hell.

37:55.542 --> 37:57.000
Literally, that's why
I was, like...

37:57.000 --> 38:02.459
I was like, Gabriela needs...

38:02.459 --> 38:03.959
No, I just kissed her.

38:03.959 --> 38:08.125
You've kissed three out of
four girls on this boat,

38:08.125 --> 38:09.125
you realize that?

38:09.125 --> 38:16.459
They kissed me.

38:16.459 --> 38:28.167
Yeah.

38:28.167 --> 38:38.584
[laughing]

38:38.584 --> 38:41.584
-You're up early.
-Are you an early riser?

38:41.584 --> 38:44.209
I think you'll be just in
time to watch the sunrise.

38:44.209 --> 39:02.375
You want a coffee or anything?

39:02.375 --> 39:04.959
I hope it's as good
as how the girls make it.

39:04.959 --> 39:19.459
-Well, I guess I am a girl.
-It is perfect.

39:19.459 --> 39:20.834
Oh, if you end
up that direction,

39:20.834 --> 39:24.167
I'd take another coffee.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.167
How is this not uncovered,
it's 7:00?

39:26.167 --> 39:28.209
Kels, can I meet you
in the cockpit?

39:28.209 --> 39:29.834
Why is this not uncovered?

39:29.834 --> 39:32.375
Sh--, hell.

39:32.375 --> 39:48.626
This is annoying.

39:48.626 --> 39:49.751
Okay.

39:49.751 --> 39:51.584
What are we doing?

39:51.584 --> 39:53.667
You've been up for an hour, Jim?
Should have knocked on my door.

39:53.667 --> 39:55.501
Oh!

39:55.501 --> 39:57.918
[snoring]

39:57.918 --> 39:59.584
Good morning, sunshine.

39:59.584 --> 40:01.876
It's gonna be a better morning
when I get a coffee.

40:01.876 --> 40:05.417
Hey, Gary, I know you are
super busy,

40:05.417 --> 40:07.250
but who would I talk to
about getting a coffee?

40:07.250 --> 40:09.125
-Just black coffee?
-Yeah, just black.

40:09.125 --> 40:12.042
I couldn't find a stew anywhere.

40:12.042 --> 40:15.375
Yeah, and I'll be up.

40:15.375 --> 40:16.876
-Gabriela?
-Yes, love?

40:16.876 --> 40:18.751
Can we get a black coffee
for Rick also, please?

40:18.751 --> 40:29.375
-Yes.
-Thanks.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.584
-Morning, Rick.
-Hey, Gabriela.

40:31.584 --> 40:33.000
Hey. How we doing?

40:33.000 --> 40:34.459
One question...

40:34.459 --> 40:35.918
what time are the girls supposed
to be up in the morning?

40:35.918 --> 40:38.584
She was...

40:38.584 --> 40:53.918
Oh, really?

40:53.918 --> 40:55.626
I know, but we've got
two deck crew members

40:55.626 --> 40:56.751
up before any girls.

40:56.751 --> 40:57.959
Okay, okay.

40:57.959 --> 40:59.334
Just trying to work this out.

40:59.334 --> 41:00.959
I'm not trying to cause a fight.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.083
I mean, I'm waking up before
the stew, it's, like...

41:03.083 --> 41:06.626
it's weird.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.792
I don't know.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.959
Okay [bleep] Gary, I'm not gonna
get into an argument with this.

41:12.959 --> 41:14.250
No, because you're
defending yourself...

41:14.250 --> 41:16.042
I'm not arguing at all.

41:16.042 --> 41:17.959
I'm not getting defensive,
I'm saying that's fine, and...

41:17.959 --> 41:19.667
Yeah, but everything I'm just
saying let's work it out,

41:19.667 --> 41:21.876
you just say... and putting
words into my mouth.

41:21.876 --> 41:23.459
-No.
-You are.

41:23.459 --> 41:24.834
You're attacking me and
you're attacking my department.

41:24.834 --> 41:26.417
You're making it sound
like we're lazy.

41:26.417 --> 41:27.959
There's two of us
out on deck, Dais.

41:27.959 --> 41:30.083
There's three of you girls
inside for this charter.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.959
What I'm trying
to say, Gary, is

41:32.959 --> 41:35.209
"I got talking to the guests,
I didn't do my job"

41:35.209 --> 41:36.959
isn't an excuse.

41:36.959 --> 41:38.292
-No, she didn't say that.
-That's what I'm trying to say.

41:38.292 --> 41:40.042
I never said she said that.

41:40.042 --> 41:41.918
But you just came to me saying
that Kelsie didn't do her work

41:41.918 --> 41:43.626
because she was doing coffees
and talking to the guests.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.250
That's what I said
I imagine was happening.

41:45.250 --> 41:48.042
I'm actually ----ing
pissed off right now.

41:48.042 --> 41:49.876
How hard is it for Daisy
to acknowledge

41:49.876 --> 41:51.501
we're picking up her slack?

41:51.501 --> 41:53.250
We're a man down,
for [bleep]'s sake.

41:53.250 --> 41:54.501
Throw us a fricking bone here.

41:54.501 --> 41:55.626
Fine.

41:55.626 --> 41:57.417
We're here for the guests,
at the end of the day.

41:57.417 --> 42:00.751
Gary, making a coffee
is a crazy request.

42:00.751 --> 42:02.292
Now you're putting words
into my mouth again.

42:02.292 --> 42:05.417
Well, you just said
the problem was the coffees.

42:05.417 --> 42:07.375
Did I say that?
I never said that.

42:07.375 --> 42:08.584
I said the problem is
Kelsie's obviously

42:08.584 --> 42:10.042
had something else to do
but the guests,

42:10.042 --> 42:12.375
and sh-- wasn't done.
That was the problem.

42:12.375 --> 42:15.250
Gary is frustrated,
taking it out on me,

42:15.250 --> 42:17.834
and history's repeating itself.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.083
This is your department.

42:19.083 --> 42:21.125
I don't want that
to happen again.

42:21.125 --> 42:23.209
Ugh!

42:23.209 --> 42:24.584
Next on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht"...

42:24.584 --> 42:26.042
You're a very insightful person,

42:26.042 --> 42:28.626
but sometimes you make a
lot of things about you.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.667
You're being a ----ing idiot,
so you better stop it.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.334
No, I'm not being an idiot.
I'm just, like, you...

42:32.334 --> 42:33.709
Yeah, you know what [bleep] off.

42:33.709 --> 42:35.584
Are you girls gonna
fight over Gary tonight?

42:35.584 --> 42:39.584
-No.
-No.

42:39.584 --> 42:45.459
Someone's gonna get hurt,
or someone's gonna get fired.

42:45.459 --> 42:48.959
This storm last night brought
a lot of swell with it.

42:48.959 --> 42:50.667
These are not small swells.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.292
Oh, Jesus Christ.

42:52.292 --> 42:53.709
They're gonna break!

42:53.709 --> 42:55.375
Dog those doors,
please, dog those doors.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.167
Hold, they're gonna break.

42:57.167 --> 43:00.042
Ah, mother----er!
[bleep]

43:00.042 --> 43:04.042
[Gary shouts]
