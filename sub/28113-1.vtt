WEBVTT

00:28.854 --> 00:31.095
Oh, man, I love the smell
of Korean barbecue.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.662
Yeah, it's considered one
of the hottest spots in town.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.622
We might lose some customers
because of the recent incident,

00:36.645 --> 00:38.951
but not enough to
make a big difference.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.801
This was the table.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.368
I'm not an idiot, I can see
the fucking duct tape.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.152
I'm sorry, Tony.

00:45.175 --> 00:48.068
Jesus, God, in their own
place of business. That is...

00:48.091 --> 00:50.853
God, it takes some balls, huh?

00:50.876 --> 00:52.725
What about the trigger man?

00:52.748 --> 00:55.945
His back was to the security
camera, and he wore a mask.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.904
God. Sounds professional.

00:57.927 --> 01:00.211
Yeah.
Got any footage?

01:00.234 --> 01:01.800
Yeah.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.566
Holy shit.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.264
Hey, have you ever seen
somebody move that fast, Slim?

01:10.287 --> 01:11.854
I've seen better.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.226
Was there business
done with Jiho?

01:15.249 --> 01:18.490
As far as I know, yeah.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.492
Is anybody responding
on a meeting tonight?

01:20.515 --> 01:23.495
None yet, but it's only
been a few hours.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.974
We gotta make sure that everyone

01:24.997 --> 01:27.455
is cool with this move.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.196
My God.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.893
What about the chef?

01:30.916 --> 01:33.113
Oh, he's an asset.
He won a culinary TV show.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.810
Oh, yeah? Which one?
I don't know.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.899
Where do you think
we can find him?

01:36.922 --> 01:39.076
I'm already in touch with him.
The Korean's hit-man?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.079
No, the chef.
All right, well...

01:42.102 --> 01:45.038
Drop down his salary, and give him
a piece of our back-end business.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.605
How do I find him?

01:46.628 --> 01:48.563
You said you already
knew how to find him.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.435
Who, the trigger man?
No, the fucking chef!

01:50.458 --> 01:52.959
Yeah, yeah, he's young, so...

01:52.982 --> 01:55.266
I'm pretty sure we could
persuade him to stick around.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.681
Okay, great.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.618
These pricks, man.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.663
They are not gonna be
satisfied with my move in.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.057
We're gonna need this guy.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.059
The trigger man.

02:06.082 --> 02:09.801
Yes, the fucking trigger man.
What is wrong with you, Slim?

02:09.824 --> 02:12.567
That wouldn't...
I got it right, Tony.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.919
Wonder if he's got
a signature dish.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.207
The chef.
Yes, the chef...

02:23.230 --> 02:24.860
Jesus, God.

02:24.883 --> 02:28.516

04:51.682 --> 04:54.575
I know for a fact...

04:54.598 --> 04:56.621
that it's my favorite record.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.754
I just don't know why, exactly.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.582
Or I can't put
my finger on it, but I think

05:01.605 --> 05:03.541
part of it is, like,

05:03.564 --> 05:06.674
it's not just one thing. It's
a whole experience, you know,

05:06.697 --> 05:09.721
It's got peaks, it's got
valleys it's happy, it's sad,

05:09.744 --> 05:13.507
it's mad, it's all of that,
it ping-pongs back and forth,

05:13.530 --> 05:15.509
and if you can just sit back

05:15.532 --> 05:16.989
if you can let it wash over you,

05:17.012 --> 05:19.252
if you can let that happen,

05:19.275 --> 05:21.428
I mean, it's...

05:21.451 --> 05:24.039
it's the best record
there is, you know?

05:24.062 --> 05:27.370
It's my favorite record, so...

05:28.415 --> 05:29.523
If you ever wanna, like,

05:29.546 --> 05:31.786
come over to the house, and

05:31.809 --> 05:34.311
listen to music
and have a food or some...

05:34.334 --> 05:37.815

12:46.287 --> 12:48.135
Um, you know,
the guy from the train?

12:48.158 --> 12:49.876
Hi.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.313
I was just actually
calling to see if you...

12:52.336 --> 12:54.272
wanna get together tonight?

12:54.295 --> 12:57.536
Yeah, sure, I'd love that.
Cool. Cool.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.495
Um, you wanna meet up
in, like, an hour? I just...

13:00.518 --> 13:03.783
have to... stop by
my work really quick.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.693
How are you, Max?

13:24.716 --> 13:26.260
You look hungry.

13:26.283 --> 13:29.176
I'll have them bring
you some Bibimbap.

13:29.199 --> 13:32.745
No, I just, I had a big
bowl of Pho, so...

13:32.768 --> 13:34.486
I'm good.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.270
That's a Vietnamese dish.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.057

What's the deal? Why do you
got all these people in here?

13:41.951 --> 13:43.669
You're doing something
different, or?

13:43.692 --> 13:46.150
We hired a young chef
from one of those shows

13:46.173 --> 13:50.371
Elite Chef, uh, Ninja Chef,
or Whatever the Fuck Chef.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.720

14:00.100 --> 14:03.428
All right, I'll try
the fucking Bibimbap.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.822
We didn't have this
meeting on the books.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.041
Is there something in
particular you wanted

14:08.064 --> 14:09.674
to discuss with us?

14:11.502 --> 14:14.526
That's kinda hard to explain.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.397
What's the matter?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.843
Hi.
Hey.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.932

the best selection.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.672

This is, like, my favorite
place in the world, so...

14:33.481 --> 14:36.353
I try to spend as much
time as possible here.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.595
So good.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.859
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.773
Do you have this?

14:44.796 --> 14:47.776
I used to, um...

14:47.799 --> 14:50.431

actually, which...

14:50.454 --> 14:51.955
Oh, I'll get it for you.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.261
What? No.
Yeah, please, let me.

14:54.284 --> 14:57.830
Yeah, it's the least
I can do, please.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.746
That's sweet of you.
What's up, Max?

15:00.769 --> 15:03.749
You all set?
Yeah, that's it.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.751
$20 for you.
Oh, great.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.144
I don't have a bag, I'm sorry.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.667
That's okay, we're
gonna wear it out.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.234
Out of 20? Great.
Yeah.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.410
Thank you very much.
You're doing great.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.586
Nice to see you.
All right.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.893
Can I, um...

15:16.916 --> 15:18.982
buy you ice cream?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.722
Can I buy you an ice cream cone?

15:20.745 --> 15:22.246
Okay.
Or something.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.769
Thank you. I thought you were
just gonna propose to me

15:23.792 --> 15:25.075
or something.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.425
Maybe ice cream first.
Yeah.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.036
The other night, when you
walked into the karaoke bar?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.168
Yeah.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.866
Was that random, or...

15:33.889 --> 15:37.217
Uh, yeah, that was just like,
uh, one of those kismet

15:37.240 --> 15:39.329
kind of, um...

15:40.852 --> 15:42.092
Um...

15:42.115 --> 15:43.615
Can I start over?

15:43.638 --> 15:45.965
I just don't wanna start
by lying to you.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.663
If you have an issue,
then speak up.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.317
There's no need to be coy.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.015
I'm, uh...

15:52.038 --> 15:53.930
Can we get some Soju?
How about that?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.780
Let's get some Soju, please.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.130
Why do you have this?

16:20.153 --> 16:23.895
Uh, it was given to me
by the people who hired me.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.074
Hired you for what?

16:31.468 --> 16:33.143
What if I don't take the job?

16:33.166 --> 16:36.102
We would have to hire
an outside contractor.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.670
Why the hell wouldn't you do it?

16:38.693 --> 16:40.324
It's a woman.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.610
We're not asking
you to kill a kid.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.205
Guess I'm just curious.
Why her?

16:52.228 --> 16:53.795
Just do it.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.712
Did you put the contract on her?

17:00.106 --> 17:04.478
Ten fucking years, and
I don't know how many hits.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.502
What's different about this one?

17:12.944 --> 17:15.098
Ooh, motherfucker.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.925
That actually kinda smells good.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.212
Try it.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.539
Oh, fuck.

17:21.561 --> 17:23.976
What did I tell you?
It's fantastic.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.653
It's authentic.

17:27.523 --> 17:30.722
The chef grew up in Calabasas.

17:30.745 --> 17:34.030
This is your idea of some sick
joke? That's not funny.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.509
I know this sound crazy.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.250
You don't have to stay here,

17:37.273 --> 17:41.950
I just thought I could
help if you'd let me, and...

17:41.973 --> 17:43.584
I didn't want you to get hurt.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.694
What about the girl?

17:46.717 --> 17:48.827
We can't pretend we didn't
have this conversation.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.785
Well, here's what I'm
thinking about that.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.874
You want to get
your outside contractor?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.354
Go ahead.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.878
Maybe he'll be better.
I doubt it.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.359
Maybe he won't
ask fucking questions.

17:59.382 --> 18:03.102
But the point here, gentlemen
is I know too much.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.582
So...

18:04.605 --> 18:07.106
You can't get rid
of me at this point.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.674
You don't talk to us like that.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.068
We're done here.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
I guess there's, um...

18:15.050 --> 18:16.225
nothing left to say, then.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.138
Oh, that was...

18:39.161 --> 18:41.294
That was a great job
with the Bibimbap.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.801
I don't need this shit.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.131
Karen, hold on. Karen!

18:54.394 --> 18:55.612
Fuck.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.539
Fuck.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.708
Is this real?

20:10.731 --> 20:13.299
Don't have any idea
who would want you dead?

20:15.301 --> 20:18.716
You said you could help me.
How?

20:18.739 --> 20:21.936
Listen, if we can just go
back to my place, like,

20:21.959 --> 20:24.243
No funny business implied,
I'm just saying.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.550
We use it as home base,
and we can figure out

20:26.573 --> 20:29.683
whatever the hell to do next.
I think that's our best shot

20:29.706 --> 20:30.771
right now, I really do.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.883
Yeah, okay.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.277
Okay.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.502
I could use a drink, uh...

20:44.460 --> 20:45.679
Yeah, me too.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.316
Should we put something on?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.840
Yeah, sure.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.217
It's the Turner Brothers.

21:15.186 --> 21:18.146
Um, do you wanna,
like, come inside?

21:19.103 --> 21:20.279
Cool.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.588
Wow.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.089
What?

21:28.112 --> 21:30.918
Um... I, uh...

21:30.941 --> 21:33.704
just wasn't really
expecting this.

21:33.727 --> 21:37.360
Oh, what were you
expecting, then?

21:37.383 --> 21:38.970
Oh, my God.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.015
Oh, this?
Whoa.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.669
Yeah, it's...
So many!

21:42.692 --> 21:46.456
Just a little, you know,
hobby of mine.

21:46.479 --> 21:49.894
Can I take your,
um, coat for you?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.809
Sure.
Cool.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.811
Thank you.
Of course.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.489
It's a wonderful coat.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.886
Uh, would you like a drink?
Can I make you a drink?

22:08.196 --> 22:10.262
It's really smooth.
Mmm.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.960
It's nice.
Yeah.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.614
Uh, should I put, um...

22:14.637 --> 22:17.791
like, some music on?
Should I put a record on?

22:17.814 --> 22:20.272
Sure, okay.
Okay, cool.

22:20.295 --> 22:23.167
Oh, vinyl mix-tapes!
Hm?

22:24.908 --> 22:26.234
You're gonna love it.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.758
All right,

22:27.781 --> 22:29.368
picture this with me,
if you will.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.675
Short guy, Pershing Square stop.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.416
Uh-huh?

22:33.439 --> 22:36.114
He's wearing a Shriners' cap,
three-legged poodle,

22:36.137 --> 22:39.204
You give him 25 bucks,
and this guy...

22:39.227 --> 22:42.468
will make you a vinyl mix-tape.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.252
Uh-huh?
And, um,

22:44.275 --> 22:47.081
yeah, you might dig
this one here.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.653
This is my favorite song!
It's from...

22:53.676 --> 22:56.439
I mean, you don't have
to be that nice about it.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.745
I mean, literally...

22:58.768 --> 23:00.312
It's from my favorite movie.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.032
Really?
Yeah.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.449

23:57.523 --> 24:00.067
the dancing, and...

24:00.090 --> 24:03.027
and, um...

24:03.050 --> 24:05.159
I don't know what to say,
I don't know what to tell you.

24:05.182 --> 24:08.380
Anything I say I feel like
is gonna sound stupid, but

24:08.403 --> 24:10.338
I just feel like

24:10.361 --> 24:14.908
I met you, and it
was like getting shot.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.215
It was like getting shot
in the stomach, and now,

24:17.238 --> 24:20.174
I got this heaviness there,
and it...

24:20.197 --> 24:24.724
just won't go away, and
I don't want it to go away.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.776
That's... Um...

24:37.737 --> 24:39.237
That's sweet.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.740

Uh, it's just a bad dream.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.472
Did you actually
kill me this time?

26:04.084 --> 26:05.738
You ever have nightmares?

26:07.566 --> 26:08.805
Mm...

26:08.828 --> 26:11.024
Not really nightmares, but...

26:11.047 --> 26:13.853
Or, like, reoccurring dreams?

26:13.876 --> 26:15.855
I dream about flying.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.640
Really?
Mm-hmm.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.642
Like with a jet pack, or wings?

26:19.665 --> 26:22.253
No, I, um...

26:22.276 --> 26:24.647
I jump from
building to building,

26:24.670 --> 26:26.649
usually, um...

26:26.672 --> 26:29.196
try to get away from
something or someone.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.722
I never get to fly in my dreams.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.992
Can I see this?

26:43.906 --> 26:45.429
Um...

26:47.780 --> 26:50.934
Yeah. Here. Here you go.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.437
Wow, it's heavy.
Right?

26:58.747 --> 27:01.402
Okay, let's just...

27:03.273 --> 27:04.579
What?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.692
Nothing, just safety,
that's all. Just, here.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.543
We're gonna put it right here,
nice and safe.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.874
Holy shit.
What?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.658
Don't move. Don't.
What?

27:19.681 --> 27:21.727
Shh. Hold your breath.
This is life or death.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.643
Got it.

27:25.426 --> 27:26.709
Make a wish.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.603
No, you go. It's you.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.571
What'd you wish for?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.987
I'm not gonna tell you.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.815
Why not?
Because it won't come true!

27:45.838 --> 27:48.861
That's not a real thing,
that's an old wives' tale!

27:48.884 --> 27:50.297
Come on.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.603
No.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.039
Really?
Not gonna tell you.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.345
Oh, is this how
we're gonna play it?

27:54.368 --> 27:57.110
Honeymoon is over,
I can see, huh?

28:07.076 --> 28:10.535
Hey, do you have
something I can wear?

28:10.558 --> 28:12.972
Oh, yeah,
if you wanna, like, um...

28:12.995 --> 28:15.627
grab, like, jeans and
a t-shirt, or something,

28:15.650 --> 28:19.065
or whatever you find in the
dresser, just help yourself.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.611
Make yourself at home.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.797
This works.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.676
I like you, Daniel, I really do.

28:46.594 --> 28:49.530
Hey, you gotta
tell me how that is.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.968
Trying to decide if I wanna
keep the chef or not.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.341
Go ahead. Give it a whirl.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.844
Mmm.

28:58.867 --> 29:02.065
That's fantastic.
Settled!

29:02.088 --> 29:04.003
We keep the fucking chef!

29:09.356 --> 29:11.074
You ever play Dreidel?

29:11.097 --> 29:14.207
Uh, no.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.209
When are the others
supposed to arrive?

29:16.232 --> 29:18.516
It's funny...

29:18.539 --> 29:20.213
They teach you how to gamble
about the same time

29:20.236 --> 29:22.172
your dick gets hard.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.869
No wonder we got a fucking
gambling problem

29:23.892 --> 29:25.807
in this country.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.115
Are they even coming?

29:30.507 --> 29:32.486
Come on.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.294
Let's play Dreidel.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.756
Look, I don't have
a lot of time, Tony.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.693
No, of course you don't.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.849
It seems your associates
decided not to show up.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.981
Now, I think

29:49.004 --> 29:52.007
they're trying to make
statement with their absence.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.814
I'll get to the point.

29:55.837 --> 29:59.992
I want the cash and your games
to move through here.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.408
What about the girls?

30:03.192 --> 30:05.432
I'll let them go, I don't give
a shit about prostitutes.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.173
It's a dirty business.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.306
The chase of the fuck
is half the fun anyway

30:09.329 --> 30:11.656
Don't you think?

30:11.679 --> 30:13.310
Well, they're not
gonna like that.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.400
I don't give a flying fuck
what they don't like.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.794
Don't you see? It'll look like
we're cleaning up the place.

30:18.817 --> 30:23.276
No one will be looking for
a cash laundry business.

30:23.299 --> 30:27.280
Why are you guys so resistant
to having your money cleaned?

30:27.303 --> 30:29.326
Well, cleaned by a Jew.

30:29.349 --> 30:33.330
And, prey-tell, Daniel,
what the fuck are you?

30:33.353 --> 30:35.506
Agnostic.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.487
Were you "bar mitzvah" -ed?

30:39.185 --> 30:40.380
Come on.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.275
Let me see your dick.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.630
I'm joking.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.742
One spin.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.180
Let's play Dreidel, shall we?

30:57.203 --> 31:00.531
If it lands on the Gimel,
you join me in the new venture,

31:00.554 --> 31:02.272
lands on the Hei, then

31:02.295 --> 31:04.796
I keep the whores, and
everything stays the same.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.929
Lands on the Shin,

31:06.952 --> 31:09.540
and I take the games from you.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.282
Lands on the Nun,

31:12.305 --> 31:14.284
then...

31:14.307 --> 31:15.786
Nothing.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.378
Oh, too bad.

31:44.554 --> 31:45.991
Goodbye, Daniel.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.803
Sloppy.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.219
Very sloppy.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.115
Make sure you clean
this place up,

32:03.138 --> 32:04.987
cause we got the health
inspector coming tomorrow.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.902
Okay?
Yeah.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.555
Can we please

32:08.578 --> 32:12.298
get a professional
to do this next time?

32:12.321 --> 32:14.213
Yeah, get the fucking chef.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.955
How about that?
Don't get smart with me.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.522
I'm sorry, Tony.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.698
Clean the Dreidel,
it's an heirloom.

32:37.433 --> 32:40.587
<i>♪ If you'd only
talk to me now ♪</i>

32:40.610 --> 32:44.026

<i>♪ I'll be so happy</i>

32:50.664 --> 32:52.991
Can we just stop for
one second? Hold on.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.732
What?
Just, I, okay.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.473
Let's just get this out
on the table, all right?

32:56.496 --> 32:57.909
I don't want to do this either,

32:57.932 --> 32:59.258
so let's just get it over with

32:59.281 --> 33:02.174
and just rip the fucking
band-aid, okay?

33:02.197 --> 33:04.069
Why do they want
you dead, Karen?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.095
I don't know.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.532
I don't know who they are.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.273
Wow.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.275
Um, Kar,

33:16.298 --> 33:19.104
we should probably figure out
who wants you dead, then, okay?

33:19.127 --> 33:20.236
Jiho didn't order the contract,

33:20.259 --> 33:22.020
so it wasn't the Koreans.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.785
I'm at a loss.
I got nothing, you know?

33:25.960 --> 33:28.200
Why don't we just leave town?

33:28.223 --> 33:30.312
And do what, Karen?

33:32.706 --> 33:35.425
I don't know,
something different?

33:35.448 --> 33:37.296
Maybe go north.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.863
To a small town.

33:38.886 --> 33:42.084
Find jobs at a local bar, and...

33:42.107 --> 33:43.824
listen to good music all day.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.784
Honey, and start a karaoke
night, or what?

33:46.807 --> 33:48.829
You wanna be a lounge duo now?

33:48.852 --> 33:50.396
I don't know fucking show tunes.

33:50.419 --> 33:51.986
What are we talking about here?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.621
This is risky business, A,

33:57.644 --> 34:00.951
and two, we can't just
pick up and fucking leave!

34:02.257 --> 34:05.411

You don't gotta be sorry,
you didn't... It's my fault.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.735
You're not responsible for me.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.565
Listen.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.025
We don't know
who tried this, okay?

34:55.049 --> 34:57.072
And they could easily
just try it again.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.966
And I don't want that to happen.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.189
I mean...

35:06.408 --> 35:09.019
What did you do for a living?

35:12.632 --> 35:15.438
I used to sing professionally.

35:15.461 --> 35:16.679
Hm.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.442
There was this company

35:19.465 --> 35:21.139
that hired us

35:21.162 --> 35:24.403
to sing karaoke
for business men.

35:24.426 --> 35:29.147
Oh, like you were,
um, you're a domey?

35:29.170 --> 35:31.062
I didn't sleep with any of them.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.544
I, it doesn't, what do I...

35:34.567 --> 35:36.067
But some domeys
do, though, right?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.590
Yeah, I know.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.897
Okay, well, more power
to you, I don't...

35:39.920 --> 35:41.638
You know, like...

35:41.661 --> 35:44.380
Did you ever have trouble
with any of the guys, or...

35:44.403 --> 35:47.101
No, no, I got along
great with all those guys.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.889
I don't know, Karen.

35:55.588 --> 35:56.937
Wanna get out of here?

35:58.373 --> 36:01.397
Like, you really want
to get out of here?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.486
Yeah.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.662
All right, then...

36:05.685 --> 36:07.403
I just...

36:07.426 --> 36:09.361
need money, and I just
need to pick up another gig.

36:09.384 --> 36:10.864
That's all.

36:13.258 --> 36:16.238
But you killed your boss.

36:16.261 --> 36:19.284
Yeah, but sadly, darling,
there are...

36:19.307 --> 36:21.417
plenty of contracts
left in the city.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.563
There's this girl.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.305
We don't know much, but
we know she likes karaoke.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.394
No, no, no.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.091
It's better if I don't, okay?

37:27.114 --> 37:29.833
Try to make it
as public as possible.

37:29.856 --> 37:32.227
Our third party wants
a statement made.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.340
No, no, no, no, no.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.539
You'll deliver the girl.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.542
I'm, I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.109
Try the Bibimbap.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.482
Bibimbap. Bibimbap.

40:55.670 --> 40:59.085
Jesus, Slimy.

40:59.108 --> 41:02.611
What the hell are you
doing over here?

41:02.634 --> 41:06.049
All right, I'm late for a
meeting, but let's do lunch.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.746
I don't need lunch.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.356
I had fro-yo.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.097
Okay.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.709
Tony did not see you
at last night's meeting.

41:13.732 --> 41:16.625
Yeah, I couldn't make it.
Give him my apologies.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.388
Quite disrespectful.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.630
Look, we want
a smooth transition

41:21.653 --> 41:24.067
with Tony moving
into Jiho's spot.

41:24.090 --> 41:25.808
Yeah, I know, but

41:25.831 --> 41:27.876
that doesn't mean
I need to be involved.

How'd it go?

42:40.558 --> 42:43.648
Well, I got a job.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.932
Really? How?

42:46.955 --> 42:49.784
Tony, please try these chips.

42:51.133 --> 42:53.266
Can't eat that shit, it's treif.

42:54.006 --> 42:55.506
And treifs...

42:55.529 --> 42:57.052
Not kosher.

42:59.141 --> 43:00.795
What's kosher, again?

43:03.319 --> 43:04.756
Hey, how you doing?

43:09.412 --> 43:11.174
What the fuck is this?

43:11.197 --> 43:12.958
I don't know.
Uh, sure you do.

43:12.981 --> 43:15.375
I've been tailing you
all day, remember?

43:16.768 --> 43:18.160
Here to see about a job?

43:20.206 --> 43:21.555
Are you an idiot?

43:25.472 --> 43:26.821
Yeah, okay.

43:29.258 --> 43:30.759
Close the door.

43:30.782 --> 43:32.717
I just like went back by
the old stomping grounds

43:32.740 --> 43:35.372
around the restaurant,
just to kind of, vibe it out,

43:35.395 --> 43:36.939
see what's going on.
Yeah.

43:36.962 --> 43:40.682
And it turns out, there's
this older Jewish hood

43:40.705 --> 43:42.727
who's coming down
from the valley,

43:42.750 --> 43:44.424
and he thinks he's
gonna come in and

43:44.447 --> 43:46.688
scoop up all Jiho's
business, so...

43:46.711 --> 43:48.864
So...

43:48.887 --> 43:50.779
What can I do for you?

43:50.802 --> 43:53.259
Well, I heard you ran
into a little resistance

43:53.282 --> 43:55.610
trying to move in here,
so I just wanted to

43:55.633 --> 43:58.569
offer my service to you
gentlemen, and see if, uh,

43:58.592 --> 43:59.918
I could help clean up.

43:59.941 --> 44:01.746
I think we got it under control.

44:01.769 --> 44:05.315
Mm, I think your guy's
a little sloppy, to be honest.

44:05.338 --> 44:07.035
That very well may be.

44:11.344 --> 44:15.194
So, how do you see yourself
improving upon the situation?

44:15.217 --> 44:17.022
Well, I know these guys.

44:17.045 --> 44:18.720
I've worked with them for
years, so I know their habits,

44:18.743 --> 44:21.244
I know their patterns,
I know their haunts, and

44:21.267 --> 44:23.072
most importantly, I know the
ones that are gonna give you

44:23.095 --> 44:26.249
a hard time cause they have
a relationship with Jiho.

44:26.272 --> 44:27.859
Are you Jiho's guy?

44:27.882 --> 44:30.668
Oh, you know,
don't kiss and tell.

44:34.715 --> 44:36.021
Naturally.

44:38.458 --> 44:41.612
Are you able to handle
all of this fairly quickly?

44:41.635 --> 44:44.159
For the right amount of money,
anything can be quick.

44:54.604 --> 44:56.496
Lay it out.

44:56.519 --> 44:58.629
All right, well, your boy
kinda botched the jump there,

44:58.652 --> 45:00.370
so now, they know you're coming.

45:00.393 --> 45:02.807
He could've planned it out,
but it is what it is.

45:02.830 --> 45:05.114
We'll let bygones be bygones.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.769
Give me about a week,
and I'll clean it up for you.

45:07.792 --> 45:11.163
It's all said and done.
And then, I just gotta...

45:11.186 --> 45:13.513
You know, you gotta
pay me 50, so...

45:13.536 --> 45:15.951
My, my, sir,
you are a professional.

45:15.974 --> 45:17.996
What's to stop him from
taking a contract on you

45:18.019 --> 45:19.519
after he's done?

45:19.542 --> 45:21.608
Cause I'm retired
after I'm done.

45:21.631 --> 45:24.307
That's why I need
the money upfront, too.

45:24.330 --> 45:26.178
Come again?

45:26.201 --> 45:28.224
Well, you know, I do my job
right, what's left for me?

45:28.247 --> 45:30.530
All the work's gone, so...

45:30.553 --> 45:32.141
Let me just clean up
and get out of your way.

45:32.164 --> 45:34.796
I take a little
indefinite vacation.

45:34.819 --> 45:36.928
A Romantic Ronan.

45:36.951 --> 45:38.451
How sweet.

45:38.474 --> 45:41.106
Well, you know,
Lone Ronan plus one.

45:41.129 --> 45:43.935
Got a... young lady
in the side-car there.

45:43.958 --> 45:45.676
What's his name?

45:45.699 --> 45:47.199
Tony Kaufman.

45:47.222 --> 45:50.312
Really funny guy.
Total mench. Love him.

45:53.533 --> 45:56.731
Don't you think
that's a little risky?

45:56.754 --> 45:58.384
Not really, I mean...

45:58.407 --> 46:00.256
The thing is none of
these people know me,

46:00.279 --> 46:02.475
so I got the anonymity
thing going for me.

46:02.498 --> 46:05.783
And I'm not attached, so if we
gotta cut and run at any point,

46:05.806 --> 46:07.503
we can just get out of here.

46:09.810 --> 46:11.658
Well, if that didn't
work out for you,

46:11.681 --> 46:13.573
I'm sure we can find you
a lot of work around here.

46:13.596 --> 46:15.837
I greatly appreciate
that, sir, but

46:15.860 --> 46:17.839
I think I got my future set.

46:17.862 --> 46:19.057
What is this?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.276
Chips.

46:20.299 --> 46:22.669
What kind of...
They're Tony's.

46:22.692 --> 46:24.410
Pork chips. They're shit.

46:24.433 --> 46:26.282
Yeah, I'm kosher,
I don't do that.

46:26.305 --> 46:27.785
So we got a deal here?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.921
Tell you what, Tommy Bahama,

46:35.314 --> 46:36.968
Buy yourself a new shirt.

46:39.884 --> 46:41.776
What's your name?

46:41.799 --> 46:43.104
Max.

46:45.933 --> 46:49.000
Don't worry. It's gonna
work out, just trust me.

46:49.023 --> 46:50.959
I promise.

47:22.970 --> 47:25.233
Your birth mark
is really amazing.

47:26.321 --> 47:27.757
Thank you.

47:29.803 --> 47:32.652
I was self-conscious
about it when I was little.

47:32.675 --> 47:36.395
Then I... grew up to accept it.

47:36.418 --> 47:39.160
Yeah, I think
it's really beautiful.

47:40.770 --> 47:43.228
You know what they say
about birthmarks, right?

47:43.251 --> 47:44.926
No, what?

47:44.949 --> 47:48.909
Uh, that they're remnants
from your past life.

47:50.737 --> 47:52.324
Whoa.

47:52.347 --> 47:54.544
Huh.

47:54.567 --> 47:57.483
So, then, what's this, then?

47:58.614 --> 48:01.313
I was told that, um...

48:02.140 --> 48:04.533
I was mauled by a tiger.

48:05.839 --> 48:07.600
Hm.
Mm-hmm.

48:07.623 --> 48:08.929
Who told you that?

48:10.757 --> 48:13.151
Some fortune-teller.

48:14.021 --> 48:15.196
Yeah.

48:17.372 --> 48:19.569
Do you have any birth marks?

48:19.592 --> 48:21.266
Yeah, I just got a little one.

48:21.289 --> 48:23.921
Like, it's right about
here on the other side.

48:23.944 --> 48:26.924
Oh.
I'll show you sometime.

48:26.947 --> 48:28.862
You know what that could be?

48:32.213 --> 48:33.844
I think you were probably shot.

48:33.867 --> 48:36.261
Mm.
Yeah.

48:39.003 --> 48:42.180
Both died morbid deaths
in our past lives.

48:43.572 --> 48:45.400
Well, we got that going for us.

48:49.578 --> 48:51.102
I'm hungry.

48:52.016 --> 48:53.385
You got anything in the fridge?

48:53.408 --> 48:55.910
Yeah, I got something
to snack on.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.737
Wanna give it a look?
Yeah.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.153
Go for it.
Yeah.

It's like, my secret
zone to just...

51:09.544 --> 51:12.524
get away from everybody, and...

51:12.547 --> 51:14.593
clear out my head or whatever.

51:22.253 --> 51:24.145
You know, Karen,

51:24.168 --> 51:26.930
you can go out if you want to.

51:26.953 --> 51:30.064
I haven't heard anything
new about your contract,

51:30.087 --> 51:33.545
and I know everyone else is
tied up in this Tony bullshit,

51:33.568 --> 51:35.286
and, to be honest,

51:35.309 --> 51:37.114
all I've ever tried to do
here is keep you safe.

51:37.137 --> 51:38.834
It's all I'm doing.

51:40.314 --> 51:42.708
I know, and I appreciate it.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.168
It's just... been a lot.

51:47.191 --> 51:49.518
I know, I know. It's...

51:49.541 --> 51:52.956
This isn't an easy situation.

51:52.979 --> 51:55.132
But I think we can
get through this.

52:02.641 --> 52:03.946
Cheers.

52:06.210 --> 52:08.276
This looks great, baby.
Thank you.

52:08.299 --> 52:09.822
You're welcome.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.541
Mmm.

52:12.564 --> 52:14.957
The pesto is killing
it right now.

52:19.223 --> 52:21.138
So, um...

52:22.617 --> 52:24.967
How long is it gonna
take to do the job?

52:26.186 --> 52:27.947
I don't know, really.

52:27.970 --> 52:31.299
I mean, it's gonna take
whatever it takes, so...

52:31.322 --> 52:36.173
A week, two weeks,
three, four, five, whatever.

52:36.196 --> 52:38.480
Can't we just leave town?

52:38.503 --> 52:40.917
Like, now.

52:40.940 --> 52:42.571
No, Karen.

52:42.594 --> 52:44.877
Uh, gas costs money.

52:44.900 --> 52:46.183
Food costs money.

52:46.206 --> 52:48.229
A place to stay costs money.

52:48.252 --> 52:49.882
You don't have any cash

52:49.905 --> 52:52.363
stashed away from previous jobs?

52:52.386 --> 52:54.931
No, why do you think
I'm taking this fucking job?

52:54.954 --> 52:56.976
I mean...

52:56.999 --> 53:00.328
Can you really trust
this Tony guy?

53:00.351 --> 53:02.939
I don't know, darling.
I do know that he's hiring.

53:02.962 --> 53:05.202
And I do know that
he's paying well.

53:05.225 --> 53:07.248
And I do know that
he wants me around.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.598
So I don't know why you gotta
ask me these fucking questions

53:09.621 --> 53:11.579
right now, if I'm being honest.

53:13.059 --> 53:15.125
What, Kar, come on.

53:15.148 --> 53:18.824
What is this, a gesture now?
You're pissed at me, come on.

53:18.847 --> 53:20.980
God dammit.

53:22.851 --> 53:25.004
Come on, hold on, wait.
Just talk to me.

53:25.027 --> 53:27.291
What's going on?
What is this about?

53:31.686 --> 53:33.361
I can take care of myself, Max.

53:33.384 --> 53:36.364
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

53:36.387 --> 53:37.649
Karen, come on.

53:38.867 --> 53:41.456
Karen, will you please
come back here?

53:41.479 --> 53:43.829
Karen? Karen!

53:45.004 --> 53:46.962
This is...

54:09.333 --> 54:11.030
Fuck!

54:26.350 --> 54:27.742
You look good.

54:30.571 --> 54:32.269
So, how've you been?

54:34.314 --> 54:36.250
Not great.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.035
You tried to have me killed?
Never.

54:39.058 --> 54:43.541
I love you. I would never
do anything to harm you.

54:46.152 --> 54:47.870
Despite everything that
you've done to me,

54:47.893 --> 54:51.569
I am still crazy
about you, Karen.

54:51.592 --> 54:54.093
You're not going
slutting in some karaoke bar.

54:54.116 --> 54:57.836
You're not a fucking
domey girl anymore, Karen.

54:57.859 --> 55:00.839
Why don't you show me
one ounce of respect?

55:00.862 --> 55:03.778
Just one ounce!
That's all I need.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.306
Get out of that shit.

55:40.424 --> 55:42.054
Watch it, fucker.

55:42.077 --> 55:43.839
Can you give me a
fucking beer? Thank you.

55:43.862 --> 55:45.580
Please, thank you very much,
you're so great,

55:45.603 --> 55:47.344
I love your work. Thank you.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.565
I'll tip you next time.

56:02.402 --> 56:03.902
What the fuck is this?

56:03.925 --> 56:06.188
That should cover
what I took from you.

56:08.539 --> 56:11.127
What about my heart, Karen?

56:11.150 --> 56:13.695
What about the agony and
pain you've caused my heart?

56:13.718 --> 56:17.351
I don't think there's enough
fucking money here for that!

56:17.374 --> 56:20.354
I'm sorry, Tony.

56:20.377 --> 56:23.357
I realized there are some
things I thought I can change,

56:23.380 --> 56:25.228
and I can't.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.969
Where the fuck did you
read that? Cosmopolitan?

56:26.992 --> 56:28.884
You know what?

56:28.907 --> 56:30.755
I regret ever having
given you my love.

56:30.778 --> 56:33.236
I don't wanna see your face,
I don't wanna hear your name

56:33.259 --> 56:34.826
ever again!

56:38.351 --> 56:40.243
I understand.

56:40.266 --> 56:41.636
You won't have to, I...

56:41.659 --> 56:43.899
I'm gone.

56:43.922 --> 56:45.706
Get the fuck outta here.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.104
Just go.

56:57.892 --> 56:59.480
Wow!

56:59.503 --> 57:01.418
What a fucking coat!

57:03.289 --> 57:05.160
Thanks, man.
It's great.

57:06.248 --> 57:08.250

57:29.663 --> 57:32.338

57:32.361 --> 57:35.582

57:36.844 --> 57:38.933
The fuck's going on here?

57:40.195 --> 57:42.676
Karen! Don't...

58:02.217 --> 58:04.002
Have some orange.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.550
I like the office a lot.

58:09.573 --> 58:11.662
I decorated it.

58:39.298 --> 58:41.474
You know what comes
next, don't you?

58:49.047 --> 58:50.309
Vinyl.

58:51.963 --> 58:53.507
You like vinyl?

58:53.530 --> 58:55.900
I love vinyl, yeah.

58:55.923 --> 58:58.120
I knew I liked you.

58:58.143 --> 58:59.884
I love vinyl.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.604
I think it's...

59:03.627 --> 59:05.475
so all...

59:05.498 --> 59:07.999
encompassing, so entirely...

59:08.022 --> 59:10.828
It's an experience.
It's an experience, yes!

59:10.851 --> 59:13.178
You have to commit to it.

59:13.201 --> 59:16.007
People nowadays...

59:16.030 --> 59:19.358
They don't any patience,
man, you know?

59:19.381 --> 59:21.665
Don't listen to the song, only!

59:21.688 --> 59:24.842
Listen to the whole album,
listen to the story!

59:24.865 --> 59:27.564
Listen to the whole side.

59:28.347 --> 59:30.413
What a concept.

59:30.436 --> 59:33.982
This shit just doesn't fall
from the trees, you know?

59:34.005 --> 59:36.811
People plan their shit.

59:36.834 --> 59:38.705
They write it.

59:40.794 --> 59:41.969
Oh, man.

59:44.145 --> 59:45.689
You know,

59:45.712 --> 59:49.586
I've been feeling
so nostalgic lately.

59:53.633 --> 59:54.698
I love this song.

59:54.721 --> 59:56.636
Me too, I love it.

59:57.898 --> 01:00:00.182
Brings back memories, right?

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:01.946
I knew I liked you.

01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.491
But...

01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:08.582
what the fuck is
going on out there?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.148
I'm sorry, Tony, I didn't...

01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:13.238
Why are you coming in here
creating a fucking scene

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:14.805
like a six year-old

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:16.633
who's crying in his
fucking high-chair?

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:19.485
You think I don't have
emotional issues going on?

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:24.293
Fucking bitch left me too, man.

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:27.296
I get it, I understand.

01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:28.863
She just came by.

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.604
Right?

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:34.303
Spike the final nail
in the coffin.

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:36.720
Remember that girl
I was telling you about?

01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:39.700
Yeah.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:42.093
She, uh...

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.205
She fucking ripped me off.

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:47.098
She broke into my house,

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:49.840
and she took my fucking money,

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.712
and she ran off,

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.366
and I don't know
where the fuck she is.

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:55.739
But you know what, Tony?

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.524
She gave me my fucking records.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.374
That's beautiful!

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:06.227
That's, they cannot take
away that from you, man.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:10.188
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.320
Fuck 'em.

01:01:15.497 --> 01:01:16.673
Thank you.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.175
Who fucking needs 'em, right?

01:01:20.198 --> 01:01:22.046
Yeah.
Who needs 'em?

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:24.135
That's what my Eve
fucking did to me. My Eve.

01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:26.204
My fucking lady Eve.

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.185
When it starts off,

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.187
you got it all
figured out, right?

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.579
And you know what you're doing,

01:01:33.602 --> 01:01:35.016
and you're doing
the right thing,

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.845
and then, inevitably,
it's just, it's fucked.

01:01:37.868 --> 01:01:40.761
You know what? I knew it
was gonna end like this.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.111
What are we talking about?
Can we blame 'em, though?

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:44.634
They're all making it up, too!

01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:46.201
It's bullshit!
That's right!

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:47.942
They just pull the rug
out from under you,

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:49.813
they rip your fucking
heart out, they step on it,

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.772
they chew it up, and then,
they spit it in your face.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:53.817
It's a fucking magic trick.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.277
Fucking bitches, unbelievable!

01:01:57.844 --> 01:02:00.084
Oh, Christ.

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.652
I thought mine was dead, right?

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:04.480
She comes traipsing in here,

01:02:04.503 --> 01:02:07.657
and tries to pay me off
with my own fucking money.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.180
Can you believe that?

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.205
Tony, I mean...

01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:14.142
Just tell me where to find her,

01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:15.993
and you never gotta
think about it again.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:43.258
My guess is she's
trying to split town.

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:45.196
I'd check Union Station.

01:02:58.035 --> 01:02:59.993
Studying her face?

01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:05.216
She really is quite
beautiful, isn't she?

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.025
Are you laughing?
No, I'm not, I'm sorry.

01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.635
No, you are laughing.
You're fucking laughing.

01:03:12.658 --> 01:03:14.028
What the fuck are
you laughing at?

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:15.769
Tony, she reminds me
of someone, that's all.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.336
No, she does not. You are
fucking bullshitting me.

01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:19.990
What, you fucking bigot?

01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:21.600
You think she's some sort
of fucking ethnic joke?

01:03:21.623 --> 01:03:23.428
I don't like bigots, Max!

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:26.759
She looks like the girl that
left me, that's all I'm saying!

01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:32.263
Of course, she looks like
the broad that left you,

01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:34.985
because they all
fucking look the same.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.142
Man, our connection...

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:42.993
It's out of control.

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:57.201
I think...

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:59.705
this will be cathartic
for both of us.

Yo, Karen.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:13.887
When you take someone's
fucking money,

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.933
you should probably leave town.

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:19.437
I didn't want to leave
before talking to you.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.985
You should've told
me about Tony.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:27.552
You should've told
me about the money.

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:29.990
Why didn't we just leave?

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:31.774
Cause I had to find out

01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:33.297
who was trying to fucking
kill you, you know?

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.821
You can't just, like,
pick-up ad run off

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.606
every time...

01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:40.870
My whole life is here, Karen.
My whole life.

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.350
What life?

01:05:42.373 --> 01:05:44.352
You collect records,
and you kill people.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.310
Maybe you should've just
thought this through

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.834
before you decided to
flip this entire situation

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:50.662
upside down.

01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:52.142
Did you really think that
we were meant for each other

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:54.797
just because we like
the same music?

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.842
What did you think this was?

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:58.453
I thought I was saving
your fucking life.

01:05:58.476 --> 01:06:00.063
I know,

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:02.567
but did I have a say
in any of this?

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:06.266
Why are you holding
that gun, Max?

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.508
No, no.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.336
Do not touch that
fucking knife, Karen.

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:13.665
Don't you do it.

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:19.604
I'm sorry that I
took your money.

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:21.302
But I paid him off.

01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:23.086
And it's done with, now.

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:25.088
It's not done, Karen.

01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:28.048
It is so fucking far from done.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:31.790
He just paid me all that money
back to fucking kill you.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:33.314
Did you take the job?

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:35.055
I'll give you one
fucking guess, Kar.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:38.058
Okay. Fuck this.

01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:41.800
I'm sick of playing roles
in other people's lives.

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.846
For you, for Tony,

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.240
for those men in
those karaoke bars.

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:48.242
You know what? Just shoot me.

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:50.331
Do what you were hired to do.

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:52.289
Or, you can come with me,

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:55.379
but if you come with me,
we are partners.

01:06:55.402 --> 01:06:56.946
You don't get to call
the shots anymore.

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.971
Because look where it got us.

01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:01.626
Please.

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:07.110
Fuck Tony, and fuck K-Town.

01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.657
You're really thinking
about this?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.919
No, baby, no.

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:15.399
It's just, if we do this,

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:16.966
then we have nothing left.

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:18.663
We are back to square one.

01:07:18.686 --> 01:07:21.623
What are we gonna do
about money, I mean...

01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:23.755
Enough about the money!

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.280
We'll figure it out as we go!

01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:28.760
Are you sure you want
me to go with you?

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:31.177
About as sure as you are.

01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:34.050
Hey, Max.

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:36.791
Shit.

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:40.294
Oh, fuck, Slim!

01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:42.232
You asshole.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:45.713
Oh...

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:49.390
Let's go!
Let's fucking go!

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:50.892
God.

01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:56.310
What the fuck?

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:59.945
I'm sorry, he startled me, Tony.
I didn't see him there.

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.490
Jesus, God.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.405
You know, we just came up

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:06.798
to ask you if we could,
you know,

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.931
like, follow you.

01:08:08.954 --> 01:08:10.367
You know, shadow.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.717
Looks like we came
to the right place.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.372
But it seems like you're in
the middle of something here.

01:08:16.395 --> 01:08:18.158
Yeah, well, I'm a
fucking professional.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.594
Yeah, you are.

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:21.595
And a good one.

01:08:21.618 --> 01:08:23.837
And such a character.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.819
Go ahead.

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:32.934
We're never gonna let her do
this to anyone else ever again.

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.671
I know you fucked her.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:56.393
I can smell it on you,
I can smell it on both of you.

01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.416
Let me tell you something, pal.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.202
I just wanted to see you
pull the fucking trigger.

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:04.813
Because I know you loved her.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:07.055
Drop the gun. Drop it!

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:10.819
I want to kill you
so fucking bad,

01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:12.255
but what difference
would it make, huh?

01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:14.301
Just let me go, Tony.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:16.433
And you never gotta
fucking see me again.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.218
It don't work that way.

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:20.330
I'm the last person you're
ever gonna fucking see.

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:23.787
Ah!

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:31.470
Can we go now?

01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:37.106
Yeah, let's go.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.850
You meant to graze me, right?

01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:45.462
Yeah, of course, I did!

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:48.029
We need to work on
our communication.

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:50.728
Okay, I'm gonna
work on that, I promise.

01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:52.404
Jesus.

01:09:57.889 --> 01:09:59.476
Ow!

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:01.240
What the fuck?

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.959
We're even now.
Ah!

01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:05.917
Fuck you!

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.464
I love you.
