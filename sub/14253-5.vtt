WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.402
All right, all right, hold on.

00:08.475 --> 00:11.273
lf you were married in 2304,

00:11.344 --> 00:14.108
and your daughter was conceived
during your 1 1th Pon farr,

00:14.180 --> 00:17.616
that would make you...
162 years old.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.616
lncorrect.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.414
Come on, Tom.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.114
The man's not a day over 140.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.621
We know you were
at least a hundred

00:23.690 --> 00:25.624
when you joined Starfleet
the second time,

00:25.692 --> 00:29.128
so l'm guessing
you're around 133?

00:29.195 --> 00:30.457
Also incorrect.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.794
l'm afraid you both lack
sufficient data

00:32.866 --> 00:35.164
to reach a logical conclusion.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.963
Come on, Tuvok, tell us.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.935
l see no reason
to enlighten you.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.063
Don't tell me Vulcans

00:40.173 --> 00:42.004
are embarrassed about their age.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.669
On the contrary,
we value the wisdom

00:44.744 --> 00:46.609
that comes with advancing years.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.512
ln that case, how wise are you?

00:49.582 --> 00:52.016
Wise enough to end this inquiry.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.318
Saved by the bell.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.357
l've got a fleet of ships
200,000 kilometers dead ahead.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.722
Can you identify them?

00:59.793 --> 01:00.782
Negative.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.885
l'm reading multiple
hull configurations.

01:02.996 --> 01:03.894
Raise shields.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.897
Red Alert.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.557
Report.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.898
We've detected a large group
of vessels directly ahead.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.231
- Hostile?
- Possibly.

01:11.337 --> 01:12.395
l'm charging weapons.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.336
On screen.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.274
l'm counting 62 ships

01:19.345 --> 01:21.108
and a few hundred
pieces of ships

01:21.181 --> 01:22.773
all dead in space.

01:22.849 --> 01:23.941
lt's a junkyard.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.450
Congratulations, Tuvok.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.610
You just saved us

01:26.686 --> 01:28.950
from a flotilla
of hostile trash.

01:30.023 --> 01:30.955
We're being hailed.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.321
Let's see what they want.

01:32.392 --> 01:36.726
Welcome to Abaddon's Repository
of Lost Treasures.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.458
Whether you're in the mood
to buy or simply browse,

01:39.532 --> 01:40.692
we're always open.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.962
Take a look.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.436
You may find something
you never knew you wanted.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.524 --> 03:45.957
Mr. Abaddon.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.788
The name was passed down
from my father

03:47.860 --> 03:49.122
and his father before him.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.628
Not a very imaginative lot,

03:50.697 --> 03:52.460
but l'll answer to it
just the same.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.625
l'm Commander Chakotay.
This is Mr. Neelix.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.632
Welcome to Voyager.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.667
Neelix, is it?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.795
You wouldn't be
a fellow trader, would you?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.270
What makes you say that?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.035
Cheerful demeanor, furtive eyes.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.871
lt's obvious
you're a man of commerce.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.877
You're very perceptive,
Mr. Abaddon.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.708
A useful skill
in my line of work.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.544
Oh, l'll admit there was a time
when l dabbled in commerce,

04:10.617 --> 04:12.380
but these days,
l focus my efforts

04:12.452 --> 04:14.044
on food and diplomacy.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.884
Well, whether you're interested
in a new iso- convective oven

04:16.956 --> 04:19.048
or a slightly dated
translation matrix,

04:19.125 --> 04:20.558
you've come to the right place.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.720
My inventory,
give or take a few items.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.559
After 20 years,
it's hard to keep up.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.065
Looks like you have
an item or two

04:27.133 --> 04:28.395
we might be interested in.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.729
Uh, the question is

04:29.836 --> 04:32.566
what are you looking
for in return?

04:32.672 --> 04:34.230
Artificial gravity plating.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.104
Plasma- based power induction.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.108
lmpressive.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.610
Those are integrated systems.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.613
Unfortunately, we couldn't
trade them to you

04:41.681 --> 04:43.546
without dismantling
our whole ship.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.709
Commander, don't
we have some spare

04:45.785 --> 04:47.776
duranium sheeting
in Cargo Bay 1?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.788
With a few modifications, uh,

04:49.856 --> 04:51.619
it could be converted
into gravity plating.

04:51.691 --> 04:55.457
Good idea. Why don't you show
Mr. Abaddon our inventory?

04:55.528 --> 04:56.790
Report back when you're done.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.991
Yes, sir. Mr. Abaddon,
follow me, please.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.492
This guy's collected more
technology than the Borg.

05:04.604 --> 05:07.164
And almost all of it
is useless.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.537
Wait. What's that?

05:09.609 --> 05:10.871
Ensign?

05:10.943 --> 05:13.070
Grid 49- Alpha.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.883
Oh, she's beautiful.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.213
lt's just an old rust bucket.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.117
What, are you kidding?
Look at those lines.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.884
lt's a work of art.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.222
That ship wasn't assembled;
it was sculpted.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.421
l think l'm in love.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.589
That makes 15 power regulators
in fair condition

05:35.668 --> 05:38.728
and three more we could salvage
with a little work.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.773
Seven has some doubts
about the ion exchange rods...

05:41.841 --> 05:42.899
We'll take a chance.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.270
Add them to the list.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.437
What about these
cultural artifacts?

05:46.512 --> 05:47.638
Oh, just a few items

05:47.714 --> 05:50.444
l thought might have
some historical value.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.778
They don't cost much.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.115
Looks like a good haul.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.211
lf that's it...

05:55.288 --> 05:58.280
Oh, uh, yes, there is
one other item:

05:58.358 --> 06:02.124
uh, a small vessel
that could be an asset.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.992
We've already got
a full complement of shuttles,

06:04.063 --> 06:05.655
not to mention the Delta Flyer.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.064
What do we need
with this derelict ship?

06:08.167 --> 06:11.159
Chakotay, this ship
is a diamond in the rough.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.534
Sure, it's got
some scrapes and scratches,

06:13.606 --> 06:16.871
but, here, take a look
at these systems.

06:16.943 --> 06:22.040
lt has a neurogenic interface
that allows it to react

06:22.115 --> 06:23.878
directly
to the pilot's thoughts.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.041
That gives it the potential
of being quicker

06:26.119 --> 06:27.746
and more maneuverable
than anything we've got,

06:27.820 --> 06:29.219
including the Delta Flyer.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.483
Add to that
an optronic weapons array...

06:31.557 --> 06:33.548
l get the picture.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.856
Are you sure you're not just
looking for a new toy?

06:35.928 --> 06:38.226
No. Absolutely not.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.390
Even B'Elanna thinks
restoring this ship

06:40.466 --> 06:42.434
is worthwhile.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.197
Maybe, if we had the manpower
to restore it.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.897
No, l'll do all the work
myself on my own time...

06:47.006 --> 06:50.601
and if l need a hand,
Harry's offered to help.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.940
l have?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.912
What will it cost us?

06:55.982 --> 06:58.109
Abaddon's agreed to give it
to us for three used power cells

06:58.184 --> 07:00.209
and Tom's interactive
record collection.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.719
My jukebox.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.490
All right.

07:05.558 --> 07:09.654
One slightly used alien ship.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.458
Don't make me regret this.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.123
You won't.

07:15.468 --> 07:16.992
Remember, just one seat.
Not much storage.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.536
She was designed for
speed, not hauling.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.536
Understood.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.867
Make sure you go easy
on the thrusters.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.202
She doesn't like
being manhandled.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.537
- Temperamental?
- Sensitive.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.541
She demands respect,

07:24.610 --> 07:26.202
like any fine piece
of machinery.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.871
Sounds like you're sorry
to let her go.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.380
Well, in some ways,
she's like the daughter

07:29.449 --> 07:31.041
that l couldn't marry off,
but that doesn't mean

07:31.117 --> 07:32.550
l'd trade her to just anyone.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.212
l've got a feeling you're the
kind of pilot that she needs,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.882
someone that'll give her the
proper care and attention.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.049
l'm your man.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.217
Don't worry, Mr. Abaddon.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.726
She's in good hands.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.888
Well, this has been
a very productive exchange.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.727
Oh, just one more thing...

07:46.799 --> 07:47.891
Uh, let me guess.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.865
All trades are final.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.639
l still can't get
an active readout.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.444
Here's the reason.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.644
Another damaged power cell.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.949
Come on, Alice, how 'bout it?

08:09.021 --> 08:09.953
Give us a break.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.183
Alice?

08:12.258 --> 08:14.385
Well, l've got
to call her something.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.395
How about the Lost Cause?

08:17.463 --> 08:20.830
Alice Battisti was
''the lost cause.''

08:20.900 --> 08:22.492
l knew her back at the Academy.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.036
She was smart, sexy...

08:25.104 --> 08:27.402
but she wouldn't give me
the time of day.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.874
All right, Alice it is.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.342
Try it again.

08:34.614 --> 08:37.845
l've got a pulse!

08:40.620 --> 08:41.881
A little snug.

08:41.953 --> 08:45.048
As Seven would say,
an efficient design.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.888
The main computer's
coming on line.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.860
There's not much in it.

08:49.929 --> 08:50.896
Just a few schematics.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.227
Looks like somebody tried
to wipe the database.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.893
Probably rolled
the odometer back, too.

08:56.002 --> 09:00.063
Let's see what this
neurogenic interface can do.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.474
Whoa.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.309
What's it like?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.645
lt's kind of hard to describe.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.980
l'm tapped into all
the primary systems:

09:13.052 --> 09:16.419
ops, tactical, sensors...

09:18.224 --> 09:19.486
What happened?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.652
We just blew out
two more power cells.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.832
See if you can reconfigure
the power distribution grid.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.059
Look, we're both tired.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.830
Why don't we call it a night,
come back fresh tomorrow?

09:30.937 --> 09:33.667
Oh, come on, we can still get
a couple more hours in.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.331
You can get
a couple more hours in.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.238
l'm going to bed.

09:38.611 --> 09:42.741
All right. You win.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.224
Good night, Alice.

09:53.292 --> 09:56.090
See you in the morning.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.941
Good night, Alice.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.281
See you in the morning.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.821
See you in the morning.

10:22.888 --> 10:27.621
See you in the morning.
See you in the morning.

10:27.693 --> 10:30.787
See you in the morning.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.191
Tom...

10:40.072 --> 10:42.040
B'Elanna?

11:04.463 --> 11:06.761
Tom?

11:17.543 --> 11:19.443
Who are you?

11:19.512 --> 11:23.642
lt's me, Alice.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.664
Good morning, Alice.

12:28.013 --> 12:32.109
l'm sorry, but you're going
to have to trust me on this.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.950
You'll be a lot happier
if we can bypass the EPS relays.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.784
- Tom.
- Yeah?

12:37.857 --> 12:39.449
Who are you talking to?

12:39.525 --> 12:42.961
Alice. She's being
very stubborn today.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.962
No matter what l do,
l can't get her

12:45.030 --> 12:47.294
to bring her propulsion
systems on line.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.300
Next question:
What are you wearing?

12:49.401 --> 12:54.338
Oh, this is a flight suit design
l found in Alice's database,

12:54.406 --> 12:56.966
something her last
pilot used to wear.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.169
For a minute, l thought

12:59.245 --> 13:02.214
you were changing
Captain Proton's look.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.873
Chapter 37?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.382
Oh, ''The Web of Pain.''

13:05.451 --> 13:06.713
l completely forgot.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.745
Oh, no problem- - l've got
another hour on the holodeck.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.056
You know, now is
not a great time.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.719
How 'bout tomorrow?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.388
That's what you said yesterday.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.557
Sorry, Harry.
Alice needs me.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.725
So does Arachnia.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.565
Give the queen my regards.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.974
Okay...

13:35.347 --> 13:37.281
Seven, can l get you something?

13:37.349 --> 13:38.475
A refund.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.179
The star charts we obtained
from Abaddon are inaccurate.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.413
Really?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.116
The computations are
based on obsolete data.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.455
lt's not the only item
that didn't live up

13:47.526 --> 13:49.619
to its advertising.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.629
Cultural artifacts?

13:51.697 --> 13:53.130
According to Abaddon,

13:53.199 --> 13:55.463
they're lost treasures
of the Delta Quadrant.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.128
lf you ask me,
they're worthless trinkets.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.603
Perhaps not.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.664
This crystal is beryllium.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.299
Valuable?

14:04.410 --> 14:06.378
Beryllium is the
standard currency

14:06.445 --> 14:08.208
in Spatial Grid 539.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.713
There are species
that would trade

14:09.782 --> 14:12.717
an entire fleet of starships
for this ''trinket.''

14:12.785 --> 14:14.719
lf Abaddon knew about this,

14:14.787 --> 14:17.551
he'd never have traded it
for a few plasma couplings.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.057
Well, maybe l should return it.

14:20.125 --> 14:24.255
Need l remind you?
All trades are final.

14:25.297 --> 14:28.391
Neelix, l need one
bottle of champagne,

14:28.467 --> 14:29.399
if you don't mind.

14:29.501 --> 14:30.559
Another anniversary?

14:30.669 --> 14:32.864
No. l'm christening Alice.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.564
Congratulations.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.937
l'll whip up some hors d'oeuvres
for the crew.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.772
Oh, no, don't bother.

14:38.844 --> 14:42.439
This is a private ceremony.
Just me and B'Elanna.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.776
And Alice, of course.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.111
Oh, yes, of course.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.618
There's nothing like having
your own ship.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.620
l remember
when l first laid eyes

14:49.688 --> 14:51.747
on my little freighter, Baxial.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.951
No, don't tell me- - 
love at first sight?

14:54.026 --> 14:56.620
Actually, l thought she was
the ugliest thing l ever saw.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.459
But she grew on me.

14:59.531 --> 15:02.329
Eventually, l- l couldn't
imagine being without her.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.425
You know, she's still down
in the Shuttle Bay.

15:04.536 --> 15:05.867
Why don't we get her
and Alice together

15:05.938 --> 15:06.870
and go on a double date?

15:06.939 --> 15:08.372
You pack the picnic basket.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.907
l'll bring the deuterium.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.201
So, l finally get
to meet the other woman.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.212
Well, don't be too critical.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.714
She's a long way from finished.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.215
When have you ever known me
to be critical?

15:18.284 --> 15:20.878
ls that a trick question?

15:20.953 --> 15:23.922
Okay, ready?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.661
Well?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.066
lt's beautiful.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.138
l can hardly believe
it's the same ship.

15:40.205 --> 15:42.105
Yeah. Most of it isn't.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.438
l've replaced
the impulse reactor,

15:44.510 --> 15:47.604
navigational array,
uh, plasma manifolds...

15:47.680 --> 15:49.944
The list goes on and on.

15:50.015 --> 15:53.109
Just a few more repairs,
and she'll be spaceworthy.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.779
Care to do the honors?

15:55.854 --> 15:59.950
lt's almost a shame
to break this over the hull.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.652
You have a point.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.161
Oh, oh, be careful- - 
the upholstery.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.826
l'll send an Engineering team
down to clean it up.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.905
- To Alice.
- To Alice.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.205
So, when's her first flight?

16:18.277 --> 16:19.710
Well, a couple of days,

16:19.778 --> 16:22.372
if l can round up
all the parts l need.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.541
You want to come with me?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.379
Sure there's room?

16:26.452 --> 16:28.044
lt'll be a tight squeeze.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.554
We'll manage.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.556
Hold on.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.217
Something wrong?

16:35.294 --> 16:38.889
lt's these
environmental controls.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.226
They need recalibrating.

16:40.299 --> 16:41.891
lt is kind of warm
in here, isn't it?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.561
Alice, lower
the ambient temperature.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.604
Please specify, Tom.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.606
Five degrees should do it.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.938
Temperature modification
complete.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.944
That's some voice.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.277
lt came with the ship.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.940
You jealous?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.212
Maybe l should be.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.310
l hear you've been
sleeping here.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.321
When Alice lets me sleep.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.188
Sounds like a real slave driver.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.491
Well, if you're trying
to make improvements,

17:14.566 --> 17:15.498
you might want to start

17:15.601 --> 17:16.659
with these
reactant injectors.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.327
The deuterium mix is too high.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.531
Well, that's
how Alice likes it.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.201
No, don't touch that.

17:25.277 --> 17:26.868
l was just trying to help.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.539
Well, thanks, but we're fine.

17:29.615 --> 17:33.551
''We''? lt's a ship, Tom.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.883
Yeah, but she's my ship.

17:35.954 --> 17:38.548
Well, then, maybe l'll leave
the two of you alone.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.216
Okay.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.055
l'll see you later.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.220
Thanks for the champagne.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.231
Oh, sorry.

17:49.334 --> 17:52.599
l need to fix that.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.643
30 meters of EPS conduit,

18:05.717 --> 18:07.309
a broadband sensor matrix,

18:07.386 --> 18:08.978
a tactical data module.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.988
Tom, l appreciate
your enthusiasm,

18:11.056 --> 18:12.489
but l can't spare
these parts right now.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.458
But they're just lying
around Cargo Bay 2.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.461
Those are emergency supplies,
and this isn't an emergency.

18:17.529 --> 18:21.158
Okay, what if l just
replicated some?

18:21.233 --> 18:22.666
That takes energy,

18:22.768 --> 18:25.498
which isn't exactly in
abundance at the moment.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.162
Maybe in a few weeks,

18:27.272 --> 18:29.035
if we can replenish
our power reserve.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.542
A few weeks?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.703
What am l supposed to do
until then?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.874
Your duties,
which you've been neglecting.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.475
You've been late
for two shifts in Sick Bay.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.349
You've been distracted
on the Bridge.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.651
Maybe it's time you
gave this project a rest.

18:45.757 --> 18:49.249
You're right.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.262
l guess l have been
overdoing it.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.230
You look run- down.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.732
Maybe you should
stop by Sick Bay

18:55.801 --> 18:57.063
and have the Doctor
take a look at you.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.193
No. l'm fine.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.567
l- l just haven't been
getting enough sleep.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.766
Well, your next shift
isn't till 0700.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.708
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and turn in early?

19:06.778 --> 19:08.837
Yeah. Good idea.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.410
One more thing.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.815
l'd appreciate it if you'd shave

19:13.886 --> 19:15.820
and change back
into your uniform.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.049
We do have protocols.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.784
Yes, sir.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.158
We'll get your Alice flying.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.196
Just give it some time.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.500
Sorry, Alice, we'll have to put
the test flight on hold.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.041
All we need
is a few lousy spare parts,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.374
but to listen to Chakotay,
you'd think Voyager

19:40.445 --> 19:41.878
would grind to a halt
without them.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.209
But we're so close.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.546
Well, he gave me a direct order.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.211
Since when do you care
so much about orders?

19:48.287 --> 19:50.380
l'm already an Ensign.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.047
You want to see me
busted down to Cadet?

19:52.124 --> 19:53.386
Don't take that off.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.892
Well, l'm afraid l have
to get back into uniform.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.394
Protocol.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.896
Forget about protocol.

19:59.965 --> 20:04.425
Once my repairs are complete,
we can go somewhere together.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.731
Leave Voyager?

20:05.837 --> 20:07.566
lt's been a long time
since l met a pilot

20:07.673 --> 20:09.607
l've been compatible with.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.644
We can go anywhere you want.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.613
lt's very tempting, Alice,

20:15.681 --> 20:17.774
but l can't just take off.

20:17.849 --> 20:19.111
What's holding you back?

20:19.184 --> 20:21.277
My job, for one thing.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.947
My friends...

20:24.022 --> 20:25.614
B'Elanna.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.626
She doesn't understand you
the way l do.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.993
None of them do.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.625
Look, maybe we can
make the test flight

20:35.734 --> 20:37.292
in a few weeks,
and if it goes well,

20:37.402 --> 20:38.835
l'm sure the Captain
will assign us

20:38.904 --> 20:40.963
on missions together,
but l can't leave Voyager.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.008
All right.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.671
l'm sure you know
what's best for us.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.681
Yeah, l think l do.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.344
You look a little tired.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.877
How about some rest?

20:57.956 --> 21:01.483
Sit back. Relax.

21:03.462 --> 21:06.431
Let me help you with this.

21:09.334 --> 21:10.733
What are these?

21:10.836 --> 21:13.566
Just some modifications
l made to your flight suit.

21:13.672 --> 21:17.108
They'll help us
work together more closely.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.609
l'll show you.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.442
Activate the interface.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.948
Just for a minute.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.986
You won't regret it.

21:37.029 --> 21:41.989
What do you say we continue
with those repairs?

21:55.914 --> 21:57.677
How's it coming?

21:57.749 --> 22:00.274
This is the last power cell.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.582
Then we'll just need
the data module

22:02.654 --> 22:05.248
from Section Beta- 12.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.225
What's wrong?

22:08.293 --> 22:10.727
Well, these relays
are just tricky.

22:10.796 --> 22:11.888
That's all.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.555
You're not being honest with me.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.931
l thought we agreed to tell
each other everything.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.063
Well, it's just...

22:21.173 --> 22:23.607
we're compromising
vital systems.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.267
Backup systems.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.608
lf there's an emergency,
Voyager's going to need them.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.271
lf your friends had
been more understanding,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.441
we wouldn't have to be
sneaking around like this.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.952
l've spent the last six years
with these people.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.954
They're like my family.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.287
Sometimes you have to
leave your family behind.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.793
They're not like us.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.955
They're trapped by
rules and regulations.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.125
Velocity, freedom...

22:49.234 --> 22:53.671
they'll never understand
these things the way we do.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.173
Yeah, maybe you're right.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.835
Of course l am.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.435
You don't belong here.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.947
You belong with me.

23:06.451 --> 23:10.217
You're thinking about
your first flight, aren't you?

23:10.288 --> 23:12.916
Tell me.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.426
Dad took me up
in an old S- class shuttle.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.562
Two seats, no warp drive,

23:22.634 --> 23:25.228
manual helm controls.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.897
l was eight years old

23:28.006 --> 23:30.065
and l was scared out of my wits.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.938
You couldn't keep
the ship level.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.274
No, not at first...

23:34.346 --> 23:38.783
but then... came
this moment of clarity,

23:38.850 --> 23:41.614
when suddenly,
everything made sense.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.620
The clouds parted.

23:43.688 --> 23:46.316
l was flying.

23:49.194 --> 23:52.129
No matter how many starships
l've piloted since then,

23:52.197 --> 23:54.961
l'm still chasing that feeling.

23:55.033 --> 23:58.002
Tomorrow, you'll catch it...

23:58.069 --> 23:59.627
only this time, there won't be

23:59.738 --> 24:02.866
any clumsy controls
to get in the way.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.067
Just you...

24:05.110 --> 24:07.044
me...

24:07.112 --> 24:09.979
and the stars.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.882
Hey.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.889
l wasn't aware you were
assigned to Astrometrics.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.552
l was just, uh, passing by.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.221
l guess curiosity
got the best of me.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.889
Are you planning
an away mission?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.058
You were charting a course.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.566
Oh, that.

24:30.669 --> 24:34.935
Uh, no, l was just taking a peek
at what's ahead of us.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.201
All yours.

24:37.275 --> 24:38.936
You've modified your garment.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.604
Uh, adapted, actually.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.942
l made a few tweaks

24:43.014 --> 24:45.278
to enhance Alice's
neurogenic interface.

24:45.350 --> 24:49.446
You know, the ''merging
of man and machine''?

24:49.521 --> 24:52.285
Perhaps you should learn
more about this interface

24:52.357 --> 24:53.619
before you attempt to use it.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.126
Convince her it's safe.

24:56.194 --> 24:58.458
l ran diagnostics
of every system

24:58.530 --> 25:00.054
onboard that ship.

25:00.131 --> 25:01.894
There's nothing to worry about.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.662
Perhaps l should examine it.

25:03.768 --> 25:07.033
Make an excuse and leave.

25:07.105 --> 25:12.202
lt's nice of you to offer,
but it's really not necessary.

25:12.277 --> 25:14.507
l have to get back to work.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.546
Power fluctuation's
down to 4.7 percent.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.887
Looks like Abaddon's regulators
might work out after all.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.721
Keep at it- - 
the last thing we need

25:28.793 --> 25:30.226
is a temperamental power supply.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.229
Bad day at the office?

25:32.297 --> 25:36.563
Bad night with Tom Paris.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.602
You're his best friend, right?

25:38.670 --> 25:39.898
So he tells me.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.769
So, maybe you can explain why
every time he finds a new hobby,

25:42.841 --> 25:44.900
l go right out the airlock.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.272
l wouldn't take it personally.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.438
The Ferengi call it the
Five Stages of Acquisition:

25:49.514 --> 25:52.278
lnfatuation, Justification,
Appropriation,

25:52.350 --> 25:55.285
Obsession and Resale.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.116
Seems like you've only
got one stage left

25:57.188 --> 25:58.780
before he loses
interest in that ship.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.051
Then he's all yours again.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.183
Until the next infatuation.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.490
We've got a .003 drop
in the warp field output.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.999
That's within parameters.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.125
Not on my watch.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.966
Somebody's removed
four power cells

26:14.072 --> 26:15.869
from the secondary
warp assembly

26:15.941 --> 26:18.205
without authorization.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.210
Whoever it was tried
to cover his tracks

26:20.278 --> 26:22.371
by rerouting power
from adjacent cells.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.379
Should we tell Tuvok?

26:23.448 --> 26:24.710
Don't bother.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.774
This is an open- and- shut case.

26:31.289 --> 26:34.087
Tom Paris!

26:44.502 --> 26:46.436
Well, Alice...

26:46.504 --> 26:50.634
looks like you've been borrowing
my things without permission.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.692
Hey!

27:11.730 --> 27:13.994
Computer, open the hatch.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.033
Unable to comply.

27:17.602 --> 27:20.901
Warning. Life support failure.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.570
Torres to the Bridge.

27:28.613 --> 27:31.241
Torres to Chakotay!

27:32.784 --> 27:34.149
Anybody!

27:49.501 --> 27:51.935
B'Elanna, what are
you doing here?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.096
Let me out of here!

27:59.310 --> 28:01.175
What the hell happened in there?

28:01.279 --> 28:03.372
Your ship tried to kill me.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.507
That's ridiculous.

28:04.582 --> 28:07.517
lt sealed the... the hatch,
vented the atmosphere.

28:07.585 --> 28:08.984
You must have
accidentally tripped

28:09.054 --> 28:10.112
the environmental controls.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.122
Don't you try to tell me
this was an accident.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.384
What else could it have been?

28:13.458 --> 28:15.153
How about ''pilot error''?

28:16.227 --> 28:18.388
Are you saying
that this was my fault?

28:18.463 --> 28:20.829
What's gotten into you?

28:20.899 --> 28:23.163
You've been stealing
components, Tom.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.292
Oh...

28:24.402 --> 28:25.869
l found the power cells.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.562
A few spare parts?

28:27.672 --> 28:29.037
You're overreacting.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.165
Am l?

28:30.275 --> 28:31.333
Where are you going?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.035
- To talk to the Captain.
- Wait.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.203
There's something
wrong with you.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.042
- Listen to me!
- Are you out of your mind?

28:36.114 --> 28:37.547
Stay out of this, B'Elanna!

28:37.615 --> 28:41.073
Or what? You'll sic Alice
on me again?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.588
Let her go.

28:45.623 --> 28:47.056
What were you thinking?!

28:47.125 --> 28:49.059
You could've killed her!

28:49.127 --> 28:50.389
She broke into my database.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.056
She was going to discover
our flight plan.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.723
Not that it matters now.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.733
What is that supposed to mean?

28:56.835 --> 28:59.998
Keep your voice down.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.968
Once your girlfriend
talks to the Captain,

29:04.042 --> 29:05.475
they'll drag you
straight to Sick Bay.

29:05.543 --> 29:08.979
One neural scan,
and they'll know all about us.

29:09.047 --> 29:11.811
Well, maybe it's time they did.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.646
Think you can just walk away?

29:13.718 --> 29:14.810
Watch me.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.320
So, l guess this is
the real Tom Paris.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.980
Life throws up a few roadblocks,

29:19.057 --> 29:20.319
and he heads
for the nearest exit.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.120
Get away from me!

29:22.193 --> 29:23.455
l need you.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.620
You should've thought of that

29:24.696 --> 29:25.958
before you tried
to kill B'Elanna.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.497
Sick Bay.

29:27.565 --> 29:30.159
Remember how you felt
when you first saw me?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.997
You knew we were
meant to be together.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.162
- l was wrong.
- Think of how it feels

29:34.272 --> 29:35.364
when you're sitting at the helm

29:35.473 --> 29:37.873
- and the interface is active.
- lt's over, Alice!

29:37.942 --> 29:40.638
One way or the other, l'm
getting the hell away from you.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.146
l'm sorry you feel that way.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.043
What are you doing to me?!

29:48.119 --> 29:50.212
Convincing you to
do the right thing.

29:50.288 --> 29:53.052
Take us to the Shuttle Bay.
We're leaving Voyager.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.557
No!

29:55.627 --> 29:56.719
Please, Tom.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.387
l don't want to hurt you.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.055
The Shuttle Bay, now.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.732
Deck 10. Shuttle Bay.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.935
This isn't the first time
you and Tom have had an argument

30:13.011 --> 30:14.774
about how he spends
his free time.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.609
This wasn't a lovers' quarrel.

30:16.681 --> 30:19.275
Captain, he practically
assaulted me.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.443
Well, that doesn't sound
like Tom.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.384
lt wasn't Tom.
lt was Alice.

30:23.454 --> 30:25.445
Now you've lost me.

30:25.523 --> 30:28.117
That's the name
that he's calling this new ship.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.787
Ever since he started working
on it, he hasn't slept.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.955
He's become irritable,
irrational...

30:33.031 --> 30:35.226
lt's not just me;
Chakotay and Harry

30:35.300 --> 30:37.131
have noticed the same thing.

30:37.235 --> 30:41.695
This new ship- - it has some kind
of neurogenic interface.

30:41.806 --> 30:45.298
Exactly. lt must be having
some kind of an effect on him.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.345
All right, l'll have the Doctor
take a look at him,

30:48.413 --> 30:49.880
but in the meantime,
l want you...

30:49.948 --> 30:51.973
Captain, we have an unauthorized
launch in progress.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.510
Seal the Shuttle Bay doors.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.489
Too late. He's out.

31:03.494 --> 31:04.426
His shields are up.

31:04.495 --> 31:05.894
l can't get a transporter lock.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.363
Tractor beam.

31:07.432 --> 31:10.060
They're trying to tractor us.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.601
- Stop them.
- l can't.

31:11.669 --> 31:12.897
You'll be able
to maneuver much better

31:13.004 --> 31:15.768
if you complete the interface.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.102
How?

31:17.175 --> 31:20.144
Activate
the connector sequence.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.114
We're one now, Tom.

31:30.188 --> 31:34.784
Think of what you want me
to do, and l'll do it.

31:34.859 --> 31:39.125
We can disrupt
their tractor beam...

31:39.197 --> 31:40.960
with an optronic pulse.

31:41.032 --> 31:44.627
Good. You have access
to our weapons.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.203
Use them.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.598
He's charging weapons.

31:50.708 --> 31:53.006
Full power to the shields.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.011
He's disrupting
our tractor beam.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.341
lncrease power to the emitters.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.814
We'll drag him in by his heels
if we have to.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.783
He's broken free, Captain.

32:01.886 --> 32:03.410
Janeway to Paris.

32:03.454 --> 32:06.082
Stand down and return
to Voyager immediately.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.988
l'm with Alice now, Captain.

32:08.059 --> 32:08.991
Let us go.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.857
You know l can't do that, Tom.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.726
She'll do anything
to get you back.

32:12.797 --> 32:15.231
l don't blame her for that,
but we have to stop her.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.562
How?

32:16.668 --> 32:19.330
You know.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.904
He's coming about.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.267
He's charging weapons again.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.501
Direct hit.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.304
Return fire.

32:26.377 --> 32:27.742
He's gone to warp.

32:27.812 --> 32:28.744
Track him.

32:28.813 --> 32:30.940
He masked his warp signature.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.141
He's gone.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.796
''And Daedalus fashioned wings
from wax and feathers

32:45.863 --> 32:48.798
and used them
to escape his prison.''

32:48.866 --> 32:51.300
That's one of my favorite myths.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.336
l know.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.736
But you left out
the part where lcarus

32:55.807 --> 32:58.708
flew too close to the
sun and his wings melted.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.636
Poetic license.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.181
Besides, if we get
too close to a star,

33:04.248 --> 33:07.183
we have multiphasic
shielding to protect us.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.154
What is it?

33:11.222 --> 33:12.883
My arms.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.186
They feel numb.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.352
Who needs arms
when you have wings?

33:17.428 --> 33:19.521
You're becoming
a part of me now.

33:19.597 --> 33:21.690
Our potential is unlimited.

33:21.766 --> 33:25.759
Forget the old Tom Paris.
He doesn't exist anymore.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.542
You know my policy.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.808
We're not looking for a refund- - 
just some information.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.611
That's one commodity
l don't keep in stock.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.549
l suggest you look elsewhere.

33:41.619 --> 33:43.519
Not until we get some answers.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.456
You'll find l'm prepared to
deal with disgruntled customers.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.459
Captain, l'm reading
active weapons signatures

33:49.527 --> 33:51.290
on three of the derelict ships.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.954
They are targeting Voyager.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.465
Before we take actions
we both might regret,

33:55.533 --> 33:58.297
Mr. Neelix has
something to show you.

33:58.403 --> 34:05.332
l wanted to say, uh... thank you
for this... lost treasure.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.707
A beryllium crystal.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.543
l'm surprised
a trader of your distinction

34:10.614 --> 34:13.379
would let this slip
through this fingers.

34:13.451 --> 34:16.318
l could say
all trades are final,

34:16.387 --> 34:19.413
but we'd be willing
to give it back

34:19.489 --> 34:22.050
in exchange
for some cooperation.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.393
Haunted?

34:25.463 --> 34:27.054
That's what
the Haakonian told me

34:27.130 --> 34:28.223
when he traded her.

34:28.299 --> 34:31.063
l blamed his wild stories
on isolation sickness

34:31.168 --> 34:33.228
and then took
the ship off his hands.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.601
Did you ever notice
anything odd about the ship?

34:35.672 --> 34:37.402
Odd? You could say that.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.443
l tried turning her
into a towing vessel.

34:39.510 --> 34:40.601
She was cooperative at first,

34:40.678 --> 34:42.202
but then she began
to require constant...

34:43.281 --> 34:44.942
l hope you haven't forgotten me.

34:48.351 --> 34:49.909
Mr. Abaddon?

34:49.987 --> 34:52.455
Wh- where was l?

34:52.523 --> 34:53.581
Constant repairs.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.649
Right. Please...

34:55.726 --> 34:57.626
l wasn't going
to tell them anything.

34:57.695 --> 34:59.094
Who are you speaking to?

34:59.163 --> 35:01.393
No one. l- l- l have to leave now.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.262
l'll return the items
you traded for the ship.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.166
Leave me alone.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.203
l did what you told me.
l found you a pilot.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.431
What is it- - 
what are you seeing?

35:08.539 --> 35:09.471
lt's her.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.666
She's right in front of me.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.833
There's no one there.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.376
Transport me back now.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.649
Janeway to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.550
He suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.885
Fortunately, l was able
to repair the damage in time.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.219
What caused it?

35:27.291 --> 35:29.725
lt appears his neural pathways
were recently restructured.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.729
l detected
a neurogenic signature.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.391
Looks like Alice
got to him, too.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.457
Wake him.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.768
Oh. She was here.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.308
The woman you saw
was an hallucination

35:45.376 --> 35:47.936
created by the derelict ship's
neurogenic interface.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.946
l've given you
a cortical suppressant.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.948
She won't be
bothering you anymore.

35:52.016 --> 35:55.782
Tell me, what does this ship
want with our crewman?

35:55.853 --> 35:57.286
She can't fly herself.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.619
She needs a pilot- - 
a biological entity

35:59.690 --> 36:01.885
to work in tandem
with her programming.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.358
Well, if all she
needed was a pilot,

36:03.394 --> 36:05.294
why didn't she just recruit you?

36:07.231 --> 36:09.165
l wasn't compatible.

36:09.233 --> 36:12.498
She... said my reflexes
were too slow,

36:12.603 --> 36:16.369
that l was as useless
as the junk that l traded,

36:16.440 --> 36:19.534
that l couldn't get her
to where she needed to go.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.669
Don't ask me
for the coordinates.

36:21.746 --> 36:22.678
She never told me.

36:22.747 --> 36:26.376
Just insisted that l get her
a real pilot.

36:26.450 --> 36:30.887
l'm sorry l didn't
warn you before.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.185
l couldn't resist her.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.191
Seven of Nine
to Captain Janeway.

36:35.259 --> 36:37.921
Please report to Astrometrics.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.729
l've managed
to reconstruct the data

36:44.835 --> 36:46.393
Ensign Paris was working on.

36:46.504 --> 36:47.732
My suspicion was correct.

36:47.838 --> 36:48.770
lt is a course trajectory.

36:48.839 --> 36:50.704
Let's see it.

36:50.775 --> 36:53.437
lt terminates
in Spatial Grid 867.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.069
Looks uninhabited.

36:55.146 --> 36:59.082
lt's empty space with the
exception of a small anomaly.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.017
A particle fountain.

37:02.119 --> 37:04.679
The Federation lost
more than a dozen ships

37:04.722 --> 37:07.987
examining a similar phenomenon
in the Alpha Quadrant.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.994
Relay the coordinates
to the Bridge.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.030
Take us out of warp.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.162
Can you see it now?

37:17.268 --> 37:19.702
Yes.

37:25.142 --> 37:27.235
What is it?

37:29.447 --> 37:31.745
Home.

37:40.958 --> 37:41.890
Distance?

37:41.959 --> 37:43.051
Six million kilometers.

37:43.127 --> 37:45.061
Decrease speed
to one- quarter impulse.

37:45.129 --> 37:46.221
Full power to shields.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.891
l'm detecting a vessel
off our starboard bow.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.227
lt's Tom.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.892
He's headed
right for the anomaly.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.561
Can you get a transporter lock?

37:53.671 --> 37:54.660
No, ma'am,

37:54.772 --> 37:56.740
not with those multiphasic
shields in place.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.103
Are we in hailing range?

37:58.175 --> 37:59.870
Opening a channel.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.036
He's responding.

38:01.145 --> 38:04.046
Keep your distance, Captain,
or we'll open fire.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.139
Tom, listen to me.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.650
The neurogenic interface
is affecting your judgment.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.312
Drop your shields
and let us beam you aboard.

38:10.388 --> 38:12.356
lgnore them.
Keep going.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.257
He's not responding.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.352
Target his propulsion systems

38:18.429 --> 38:19.862
and fire.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.623
Direct hit.

38:23.734 --> 38:24.996
The vessel's shields
are holding.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.296
Doctor to the Bridge.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.496
Cease fire.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.368
Ensign Paris' neural readings
are fluctuating.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.375
His synaptic functions
have become linked to the ship.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.879
lf we keep firing,
we could injure him severely.

38:35.946 --> 38:37.038
Acknowledged.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.046
Tuvok, stand down.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.707
We've got ten minutes
until he reaches

38:39.784 --> 38:40.876
the particle fountain.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.384
ls there any way
to disable their shields

38:42.453 --> 38:43.750
without firing weapons?

38:43.821 --> 38:45.880
lf l could access
their main computer

38:45.956 --> 38:47.685
and transmit
a shutdown sequence...

38:47.758 --> 38:49.726
Problem is,
Tom and Alice would detect it.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.557
They'd compensate.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.563
Unless we find a way
to distract them.

38:53.631 --> 38:54.893
Bridge to the Doctor.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.227
Go ahead.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.768
Any progress on your analysis
of the neurogenic interface?

38:58.836 --> 39:00.201
Not yet, Captain.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.362
Would it be possible to tap

39:01.439 --> 39:03.168
into the interface
using a com signal?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.969
l believe so,

39:05.042 --> 39:07.203
but l don't know
what that would accomplish.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.007
You've got five minutes; do it.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.480
And tell B'Elanna to prepare
for an away mission.

39:11.549 --> 39:14.017
Captain?

39:19.090 --> 39:20.148
We're four minutes away.

39:20.224 --> 39:21.213
Bridge to Sick Bay.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.657
- Status?
- Stand by, Captain.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.490
l'm making
the final adjustments.

39:24.562 --> 39:27.497
l'm not sure how l feel
about getting inside Tom's head.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.328
Maybe you'll be able
to explain a few things

39:29.400 --> 39:31.129
when you get back.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.260
l knew you were the one.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.330
No one's ever gotten me
this close before.

39:37.441 --> 39:40.035
l'll have you home
in just a few minutes.

39:40.111 --> 39:43.547
l promise you won't
be disappointed.

39:43.614 --> 39:44.945
Don't believe her.

39:46.016 --> 39:47.881
Where's Alice?

39:48.018 --> 39:49.713
There is no Alice.

39:49.787 --> 39:52.278
She's a pile of circuits
in this ship's computer core.

39:52.356 --> 39:55.519
You're letting
a program delude you.

39:55.593 --> 39:58.892
Doctor to Bridge.
She's in.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.553
Now.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.156
Accessing their main computer.

40:03.267 --> 40:04.564
You don't understand.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.397
This is what l've
always dreamed of.

40:06.504 --> 40:08.938
You're still dreaming,
and when you wake up,

40:09.006 --> 40:10.064
you're in for a big surprise.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.106
Alice needs me.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.267
So do l.

40:12.343 --> 40:13.571
Nice sentiment, but it's a lie.

40:13.644 --> 40:16.112
Your family will do anything
to keep us apart.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.442
Don't listen to them.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.107
Tom, it's me, B'Elanna.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.946
Alice is an illusion.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.610
l'm giving you
what you always wanted- -

40:22.686 --> 40:24.119
something they could never do.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.179
Does that sound
like an illusion?

40:26.257 --> 40:28.782
l can't... think.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.089
Leave me alone, both of you.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.460
They've accessed our systems.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.328
They're trying
to disable my shields.

40:35.399 --> 40:36.331
Stop them.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.426
Focus on me.
Listen to me.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.004
My shields are failing.
Do something!

40:41.138 --> 40:43.572
lt's time to come home.

40:43.641 --> 40:44.608
Tom.

40:44.675 --> 40:45.607
No!

40:45.676 --> 40:48.270
Hang on. We're going
to get you out of here.

40:48.345 --> 40:49.243
Tom!

40:49.313 --> 40:50.905
No!

40:52.483 --> 40:53.415
l've got it, Captain.

40:53.484 --> 40:54.416
Their shields are down.

40:54.485 --> 40:56.009
Beam him to Sick Bay.

40:56.086 --> 40:58.680
There's too much interference
from the particle fountain.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.621
l'm boosting
the confinement beam.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.248
Try it now.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.022
We've got him!

41:05.095 --> 41:08.258
Alice is losing helm control.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.302
Resume course
to the Alpha Quadrant.

41:26.517 --> 41:28.781
You'll need a few days
to fully recover.

41:28.853 --> 41:29.945
Think you can manage

41:30.020 --> 41:31.612
to stay off your feet
for that long?

41:31.689 --> 41:33.623
lf he doesn't,
l'll break his legs.

41:33.691 --> 41:37.991
Well, then, l'll leave you
to B'Elanna's tender mercies.

41:39.363 --> 41:42.628
l've got something for you.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.794
lt's a get well card
from Naomi Wildman.

41:45.903 --> 41:47.131
lt's a pretty good
likeness of you,

41:47.238 --> 41:51.174
but l don't think
she quite captured my eyes.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.015
l'm sorry...

41:59.083 --> 42:00.948
for everything.

42:01.051 --> 42:03.611
lt wasn't your fault.

42:06.290 --> 42:09.726
But l remember all of it...

42:09.793 --> 42:14.253
everything l said,
everything l did...

42:15.633 --> 42:19.228
lt was like l was sleepwalking.

42:19.336 --> 42:22.931
The important thing
is you woke up.

42:24.174 --> 42:26.301
Yeah.

42:28.012 --> 42:31.470
Thanks for being my alarm clock.

42:35.352 --> 42:38.150
Anytime.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.784
From now on...

42:42.860 --> 42:45.954
l promise no more affairs
with strange ships.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.965
What about the Delta Flyer?

42:52.236 --> 42:55.330
We're just friends.
