34:46.650 --> 34:51.883
CLEAN THIS UP. WHAT IN THE HELL

34:51.890 --> 34:53.710

34:55.390 --> 34:58.427
CUT WITH THE 11 BLADE. BUT WHEN

34:58.430 --> 34:59.749
I REACHED FOR THE OSTEOTOME AND

34:59.760 --> 35:05.369
SET UP TO BREAK THE BRIDGE,

35:05.370 --> 35:07.224

35:08.400 --> 35:09.560
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS YOU WERE

35:09.570 --> 35:13.438
BEING?

35:13.440 --> 35:14.429
Christian: MY HANDS STARTED TO

35:14.440 --> 35:19.571
SHAKE. I WAS STARING AT MYSELF

35:19.580 --> 35:23.346
IN THE MIRROR, AND I REALIZE I'M

35:23.350 --> 35:27.241
ALONE. MY NOSE WAS BLEEDING, AND

35:27.250 --> 35:29.684
THE ONLY PERSON I TRUSTED WAS

35:29.690 --> 35:35.196
