WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.553
Wonderful, Orko, just wonderful.

01:29.762 --> 01:32.322
I must say,
you're getting rather good, Orko.

01:32.531 --> 01:33.706
And I can see there's been a

01:33.731 --> 01:35.115
definite change for the better.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.234
Yeah, you're even cleaning
up after yourself now.

01:38.337 --> 01:39.495
And that's a real change.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.838
What do you mean, change?

01:40.839 --> 01:42.573
I'm the same as I've always

01:42.574 --> 01:44.353
been. You just never appreciated

01:44.378 --> 01:45.743
me, and besides, people

01:45.744 --> 01:47.939
don't change.
The weather changes, not people.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.318
Well, I don't know that I agree with that,

01:50.343 --> 01:51.833
old buddy. People can change.

01:52.084 --> 01:54.886
I hate to tell a prince he's
wrong, but Adam...

01:54.887 --> 01:56.425
You couldn't be wronger!

01:56.450 --> 01:58.156
People are what they are.

01:58.157 --> 01:59.194
The good stay good,

01:59.219 --> 02:00.911
and the evil are always evil,

02:01.327 --> 02:03.852
and I'd like to see
somebody prove me wrong!

02:04.063 --> 02:04.764
You're wrong,

02:04.789 --> 02:06.351
absolutely wrong, Sibyline.

02:06.598 --> 02:10.158
Not this time,
it's not too late for me to change.

02:10.369 --> 02:11.734
I've had enough, Gorgon.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.416
You've had me destroy
everything, that was good and

02:14.441 --> 02:16.182
beautiful here on the Isle of Tears...

02:16.208 --> 02:17.482
and I will do no more.

02:17.507 --> 02:19.360
What's that? You'll do as...

02:19.445 --> 02:20.685
I say and that's final.

02:20.710 --> 02:22.597
I give the orders on this island.

02:22.815 --> 02:25.047
No, no more spells,

02:25.072 --> 02:27.799
no more floods, no more fiery monsters.

02:28.287 --> 02:31.356
I was once a good sorceress,
and like a fool...

02:31.357 --> 02:33.624
I let you turn me into an evil one.

02:33.625 --> 02:37.117
You're still, a good sorceress.
Good and Evil.

02:39.031 --> 02:42.728
Oh, to think I helped you,
overthrow King Danton.

02:43.068 --> 02:45.108
You can always join him in the dungeon.

02:45.337 --> 02:47.635
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Gorgon.

02:48.073 --> 02:49.597
We'll see about that.

02:52.277 --> 02:54.979
Your sorcery is better
spent on our enemies.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.017
You are the enemy,

02:56.042 --> 02:58.462
and I'll see no more of your evil reign.

02:58.784 --> 03:00.081
Guards, guards!

03:01.587 --> 03:03.287
Throw her in with Danton.

03:03.288 --> 03:05.186
If you feel so sorry for the king,

03:05.211 --> 03:07.271
I'll let you join him in the dungeon.

03:12.498 --> 03:14.180
So, now the great Gorgon,

03:14.205 --> 03:16.534
is even jailing his evil friends.

03:16.535 --> 03:18.503
He's no friend, King Danton,

03:18.504 --> 03:21.473
and I realize now, you were never my enemy.

03:21.707 --> 03:23.405
A little late for that, Sibyline.

03:23.430 --> 03:24.928
We're both his prisoner now.

03:25.244 --> 03:27.804
Maybe, it's not too late.

03:28.013 --> 03:31.382
I think, I have enough magic
to leave this dungeon...

03:31.383 --> 03:32.783
But where could I go?

03:32.808 --> 03:34.740
Who could I get to help us?

03:34.987 --> 03:37.489
Well, if you really changed your
ways, Sibyline,

03:37.514 --> 03:39.505
there's always King Randor and He-Man.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.559
They'd help.
-Of course.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.118
I will go to Eternia.

03:43.295 --> 03:45.219
I must convince them that I want to

03:45.244 --> 03:47.380
make up for what I've done in the past.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.001
That may be difficult,

03:49.026 --> 03:50.787
there is much to forgive.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.099
I must try.

03:53.372 --> 03:56.500
Oh, I wish I had enough
magic to set you free.

03:56.742 --> 03:59.066
I've waited years for something like this,

03:59.091 --> 04:01.226
I can wait a little longer.

04:01.447 --> 04:04.382
Let's just hope, they believe you.

04:04.450 --> 04:06.145
Now go. Quickly.

04:06.351 --> 04:09.752
I'll return, Majesty,
to see you back on the throne.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.223
See, I told ya people don't change.

04:20.432 --> 04:21.660
Adam's right again.

04:29.408 --> 04:31.409
Sorry I'm late. I guess I overslept.

04:31.410 --> 04:34.402
I've received a message from
Sibyline the Sorceress, today.

04:34.713 --> 04:36.772
Sibyline? What does she want?

04:37.015 --> 04:39.347
She asked for our help against Gorgon.

04:39.551 --> 04:42.042
She says she's changed.
- Changed?

04:42.254 --> 04:45.189
Sibyline's been one of
Eternia's most evil creatures.

04:45.524 --> 04:47.107
But if she's asking for our help,

04:47.132 --> 04:48.574
how can we refuse her request?

04:48.760 --> 04:51.991
Easy, we say no. Hey, she's bad. I've...

04:52.231 --> 04:53.729
heard about her: She once turned a

04:53.754 --> 04:55.399
whole army into little fish with feet...

04:55.400 --> 04:57.067
Yech! It took the Sorceress of

04:57.092 --> 04:58.757
Grayskull to turn them back.

04:58.937 --> 05:01.006
Orko, we must listen to all

05:01.031 --> 05:03.074
who ask for help. Anyone.

05:03.075 --> 05:04.695
I have asked her to come here.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.933
She is to be treated with all courtesy.

05:07.446 --> 05:10.142
I have a bad feeling about her.

05:10.482 --> 05:11.818
Don't worry little buddy,

05:11.843 --> 05:13.339
you'd look good as a fish.

05:13.585 --> 05:15.143
Heh, especially with feet.

05:19.825 --> 05:23.522
Your Majesties,
I thank you both for seeing me.

05:23.695 --> 05:25.349
You've shown great trust in opening your

05:25.374 --> 05:27.211
doors to one who once opposed you.

05:27.533 --> 05:30.900
Our goal is for a united
and peaceful universe.

05:31.103 --> 05:33.298
We first must start with Eternia,

05:33.639 --> 05:35.436
and you are welcome here.

05:35.741 --> 05:37.971
I think I'd better keep an eye on her.

05:43.115 --> 05:46.183
King Danton was loved by his people...

05:46.184 --> 05:48.010
but Gorgon has made the people his

05:48.035 --> 05:50.042
slaves and I've helped him.

05:50.289 --> 05:51.355
I was wrong.

05:51.356 --> 05:53.722
Slavery is a terrible thing.

05:53.926 --> 05:55.426
It is, indeed.

05:55.427 --> 05:58.521
But I have changed and things can change.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.433
King Danton is still alive,

06:00.458 --> 06:02.349
but he is Gorgon's prisoner.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.012
Together, we could free him.

06:04.037 --> 06:05.356
Then we will do that.

06:05.504 --> 06:07.802
Looks like our work is cut out for us.

06:08.006 --> 06:09.519
If she can be trusted...

06:09.544 --> 06:11.056
and even if she can't.

06:12.878 --> 06:14.645
I've asked you here, Evil-Lyn...

06:14.646 --> 06:15.645
because there is no

06:15.670 --> 06:17.298
sorceress more evil than you.

06:17.482 --> 06:18.881
Thank you, Gorgon,

06:19.084 --> 06:20.779
but, to your problem.

06:20.986 --> 06:22.600
Who would have thought Sibyline

06:22.625 --> 06:24.343
would go off to the other side?

06:24.523 --> 06:27.117
Let's see what she's up to, shall we.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.041
What could we possibly

06:42.066 --> 06:43.107
do to make them think...

06:43.108 --> 06:44.397
Sibyline is still evil?

06:44.422 --> 06:46.158
That should be easy enough.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.964
It appears that the little
one doesn't trust her.

06:49.281 --> 06:52.682
We'll double that feeling with
a little flying dragon action.

06:54.886 --> 06:55.915
Great, great, great.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.174
I love flying dragons.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.015
You saved our lives, Sibyline.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.311
I am your humble servant.

07:31.423 --> 07:33.557
...and she zapped the
dragon right into a cage.

07:33.558 --> 07:36.425
I tell you. She knew it was coming.
She set this...

07:36.662 --> 07:38.040
all up. Where could a dragon

07:38.065 --> 07:39.246
come from around here?

07:39.564 --> 07:42.533
I'll tell you. I just checked.

07:42.968 --> 07:44.959
A dragon escaped from the royal zoo,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.400
and if it hadn't been for...

07:46.405 --> 07:47.627
Sibyline, there's no telling

07:47.652 --> 07:48.829
what might have happened.

07:49.408 --> 07:51.442
Well, little buddy, maybe you're wrong.

07:51.443 --> 07:54.207
No, I'm right. I still think she did it.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.886
Guess who's up to something now?

08:01.911 --> 08:03.109
Sibyline, that's who.

08:03.355 --> 08:05.414
I had better check the guards.

08:06.425 --> 08:09.155
I think it's time to visit our Sorceress...

08:12.064 --> 08:14.362
and time for me, to check on Sibyline.

08:20.906 --> 08:23.466
Sibyline is a powerful sorceress...

08:23.742 --> 08:25.502
and I'd rather have her as a friend,

08:25.527 --> 08:27.011
than an enemy.

08:27.012 --> 08:28.570
But, is she a friend?

08:28.814 --> 08:31.374
She is Gorgon's enemy now...

08:31.650 --> 08:34.585
and with her help, he can be defeated.

08:34.852 --> 08:36.582
Then, she has our trust.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.246
We must give her the chance
to prove she has changed,

08:39.857 --> 08:42.025
and that even, within evil...

08:42.027 --> 08:43.765
Lies the possibility for good.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.817
We'll give Sibyline her chance.

08:58.076 --> 09:00.943
I've never seen such a storm.

09:04.483 --> 09:05.609
Quick, it's a flood!

09:07.552 --> 09:10.544
Help! Help!

09:10.822 --> 09:13.017
Hold on, Orko. I'm on my way!

09:13.225 --> 09:15.557
By the power of Grayskull!

09:21.933 --> 09:26.097
I have the power!

09:27.139 --> 09:29.505
Help! Help!

09:35.213 --> 09:36.680
Stay afloat, Orko!

10:16.922 --> 10:18.549
What were you doing down here?

10:20.525 --> 10:22.026
I was following Sibyline...

10:22.027 --> 10:24.996
but she disappeared just before the flood.

10:27.866 --> 10:30.801
It's over, Orko. The storm is over.

10:34.239 --> 10:35.390
I don't believe it.

10:35.415 --> 10:37.875
The storm is gone as fast as it came...

10:37.876 --> 10:39.867
as if by magic.

10:40.078 --> 10:41.622
She did it, She caused it.

10:41.647 --> 10:43.902
I'm a magician and I can feel magic.

10:44.082 --> 10:45.549
Bad magic.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.693
You have no proof, Orko.

10:56.962 --> 10:58.434
But Your Majesty, you've seen

10:58.459 --> 11:00.183
what happens since she got here.

11:00.365 --> 11:02.526
It certainly seems like sorcery to me.

11:02.734 --> 11:05.396
There's still no proof
and until there is some...

11:05.604 --> 11:08.573
We must work for peace at all costs.

11:12.510 --> 11:14.368
Your concern is real, Orko.

11:14.393 --> 11:16.732
These events are indeed magical.

11:17.215 --> 11:19.012
But not by my magic.

11:19.317 --> 11:21.719
Who's then?
I don't know...

11:21.720 --> 11:22.970
but my guess,

11:22.995 --> 11:25.397
is it comes from
the Isle of Tears.

11:25.624 --> 11:28.459
You must go with Sibyline
to the Isle of Tears...

11:28.460 --> 11:30.659
and help break the rule
of the tyrant Gorgon.

11:30.684 --> 11:33.114
Then return Danton to his throne.

11:33.365 --> 11:35.557
Ah! just what everybody needs,

11:35.582 --> 11:37.553
A magical island holiday.

11:48.813 --> 11:51.782
Your plan is working perfectly, Evil-Lyn.

11:52.017 --> 11:53.956
Haha, yes.
Not only will

11:53.981 --> 11:56.253
we bring Sibyline to her knees...

11:56.254 --> 11:57.949
but we'll get He-Man too.

11:59.324 --> 12:00.740
And I'll make Sibyline

12:00.765 --> 12:02.374
beg me for forgiveness.

12:11.102 --> 12:12.900
I'm sorry I came along.

12:12.925 --> 12:14.721
This place is creepy.

12:23.848 --> 12:25.382
Follow me, this is the

12:25.407 --> 12:27.706
entrance to my secret workshop.

12:35.093 --> 12:36.938
I think your secret workshop

12:36.963 --> 12:38.609
isn't a secret anymore.

12:40.932 --> 12:42.566
It doesn't matter.

12:42.567 --> 12:45.235
What does matter is freeing King Danton...

12:45.236 --> 12:48.296
and ridding this island of Gorgon's rule.

12:51.910 --> 12:54.845
This will take us to Danton's dungeon.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.342
Bet this is a trap.
I can feel it

12:58.550 --> 13:00.279
Oh hush, Orko.

13:07.592 --> 13:08.498
Step softly.

13:08.523 --> 13:10.710
The guards have sharp ears.

13:11.162 --> 13:12.998
Don't have to worry about me.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.555
I'm not even touching the ground.
See.

13:18.837 --> 13:20.236
Oops.

13:20.438 --> 13:22.702
King Danton should be nearby.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.275
There's, his cell.

13:25.477 --> 13:26.705
This sure feels funny.

13:26.811 --> 13:28.779
Alright, ready yourselves.

13:33.918 --> 13:37.319
He's in there
and unguarded too.

13:40.725 --> 13:43.592
Ah Sibyline, I'd hope you'd come back.

13:43.795 --> 13:45.319
You brought He-Man.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.308
I never thought I'd see the

13:47.333 --> 13:48.755
day when I'd be rescued.

13:48.933 --> 13:51.401
That's why Sibyline brought us.

13:51.503 --> 13:53.155
Now we'll remove Gorgon from the throne

13:53.180 --> 13:54.926
and free the Isle of Tears.

13:55.073 --> 13:57.148
And return King Danton,

13:57.173 --> 13:59.329
to his rule of the kingdom.

14:02.247 --> 14:04.214
That was a trick, I told you.

14:04.215 --> 14:05.541
Welcome home, Sibyline.

14:05.566 --> 14:07.640
You've played your part perfectly.

14:07.986 --> 14:10.216
Just as you and I planned.

14:10.488 --> 14:11.970
So, Orko was right.

14:11.995 --> 14:13.709
Sibyline tricked us.

14:13.958 --> 14:16.722
Wait. Let's hear Sibyline's side.

14:16.995 --> 14:19.182
I have been honest with you.

14:19.207 --> 14:21.080
I had not tricked you.

14:21.332 --> 14:22.765
Gorgon is lying.

14:23.034 --> 14:25.628
He wants you to think I'm still evil.

14:25.870 --> 14:27.667
I know it's hard to believe...

14:27.872 --> 14:30.170
but I want to right the wrongs I've done.

14:30.442 --> 14:32.593
Gorgon, I have come back to

14:32.618 --> 14:34.835
help replace you with the real king.

14:35.513 --> 14:37.174
Replace me? Well then...

14:37.415 --> 14:38.918
I'm afraid you'll have to spend

14:38.943 --> 14:40.517
the rest of your days in the...

14:40.518 --> 14:41.951
dungeon with your new friends.

14:42.153 --> 14:44.417
Because I no longer need your aid.

14:44.756 --> 14:46.348
Isn't that right, Evil-Lyn?

14:46.558 --> 14:48.048
That's right, Sibyline.

14:48.293 --> 14:52.286
Even He-Man can't break
through 2 ft of solid steel.

14:52.464 --> 14:53.583
Evil-Lyn!

14:53.608 --> 14:56.618
Oh, then that explains all the magic.

14:56.868 --> 14:58.364
You must believe me, He-Man.

14:58.389 --> 14:59.884
This has been their doing.

15:00.071 --> 15:02.301
They wanted you to mistrust me.

15:02.507 --> 15:04.975
They didn't think I
would get another chance.

15:05.243 --> 15:06.477
I believe you.

15:06.478 --> 15:08.345
They were wrong about our not giving

15:08.346 --> 15:10.041
you a chance to change,

15:10.281 --> 15:12.772
and they were wrong about something else.

15:13.017 --> 15:16.111
2 ft of solid steel, you say?

15:26.197 --> 15:27.858
Ladies first.

15:31.236 --> 15:32.897
Guards! Guards!

15:47.051 --> 15:49.212
Now don't go away.

15:59.097 --> 16:01.065
I'll use my lasso line.

16:01.432 --> 16:02.831
Good idea.

16:08.673 --> 16:10.300
That about ties it up, Father.

16:18.816 --> 16:20.076
Thanks, Sibyline.

16:20.101 --> 16:21.138
Anytime.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.404
Thank you, Orko.

16:33.429 --> 16:34.384
Anytime.

16:38.369 --> 16:39.916
Well, that should take care

16:39.941 --> 16:41.590
of those guards for the time being.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.899
And now, let's find Gorgon.

16:45.076 --> 16:46.373
This way.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.018
What now, Evil-Lyn? What now?

16:55.019 --> 16:58.188
Do something.
They'll be here any second.

16:58.189 --> 17:00.561
They'll never get
through that door.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.445
My magic will keep them out.

17:04.229 --> 17:07.221
But you've locked up my guards too.

17:07.632 --> 17:10.467
You fool, I'm here.

17:10.492 --> 17:12.583
We don't need any guards.

17:15.506 --> 17:17.497
The others are at the front door.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.108
I thought we'd use the back way.

17:20.345 --> 17:21.675
Guards, guards!

17:25.049 --> 17:26.641
I'll get Gorgon.

18:01.886 --> 18:03.746
You'll have to hold your breath and swim

18:03.771 --> 18:05.869
to catch me now, He-Man.

18:07.925 --> 18:09.119
Quick, take it down.

18:26.210 --> 18:27.575
Look what I caught.

18:29.013 --> 18:32.312
Your magic is no match for mine, Sibyline.

18:32.517 --> 18:35.953
Give up now and return to your
master, Gorgon.

18:36.154 --> 18:38.850
Not to Gorgon and never to you.

18:39.157 --> 18:41.717
Then you leave me no choice.

18:44.228 --> 18:46.125
I was afraid of your magic

18:46.150 --> 18:48.484
once, Evil-Lyn, but no longer.

18:48.733 --> 18:52.336
I have the strength of
the truth behind me now.

18:52.337 --> 18:54.703
We'll see about that.

18:57.608 --> 19:01.567
Now, Sibyline, we shouldn't be fighting.

19:01.779 --> 19:04.213
We've always been such good friends.

19:04.482 --> 19:06.850
I'd rather be changed into a bug...

19:06.851 --> 19:09.086
than call myself your friend.

19:09.087 --> 19:10.554
Well...

19:11.489 --> 19:13.423
if that's what you want...

19:14.926 --> 19:17.227
They just don't make doors...

19:17.228 --> 19:18.327
like they used to.

19:18.352 --> 19:20.097
Evil-Lyn, do something!

19:20.098 --> 19:22.999
I'm about to, but not for you.

19:26.738 --> 19:28.865
Can't we talk this over?

19:31.609 --> 19:34.411
With Gorgon now answering for his crimes...

19:34.412 --> 19:37.540
the Isle of Tears sheds only tears of joy.

19:37.782 --> 19:39.750
Thanks to He-Man and all of you.

19:39.951 --> 19:42.476
Especially you, Sibyline.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.055
I hereby, pardon your past misdeeds...

19:45.056 --> 19:48.583
and welcome you to our new future.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.839
I could never have accomplished

19:50.864 --> 19:52.986
all of this without my new friends,

19:53.297 --> 19:55.536
and I hope I can count on you,

19:55.561 --> 19:57.724
Orko, among my new friends.

19:57.902 --> 20:00.063
I'd like that.

20:03.674 --> 20:04.760
You see, Orko?

20:04.785 --> 20:07.498
All people are
capable of change.

20:07.979 --> 20:10.053
And we must always be open and willing

20:10.078 --> 20:11.939
to give them the chance to change.

20:12.116 --> 20:13.534
'Course as I've always said,

20:13.559 --> 20:15.234
people can change.

20:15.553 --> 20:17.111
You what?

20:17.355 --> 20:20.085
Hey, anyone want to see some magic?

20:20.258 --> 20:21.655
Yeah, I think you better do your

20:21.680 --> 20:23.251
disappearing act.

20:23.461 --> 20:26.259
Sometimes I feel that I am not appreciated.

20:26.764 --> 20:28.129
See ya later, folks.

20:30.401 --> 20:32.130
See you later, little buddy.

20:36.908 --> 20:40.277
As you saw in today's
story, people can change.

20:40.278 --> 20:41.045
Right, Teela.

20:41.046 --> 20:43.513
Sibyline had always been an evil sorceress.

20:43.514 --> 20:46.074
But she was able to change
her ways for the better.

20:46.818 --> 20:49.519
Maybe there's something about
yourself that you don't like,

20:49.520 --> 20:53.123
a bad habit maybe.
It's easy to say, 'I can't change'.

20:53.124 --> 20:55.158
But the truth is, you can change

20:55.159 --> 20:58.128
almost any behavior if you really want to.

20:58.329 --> 21:01.765
And the first step is
saying to yourself 'I can'.
