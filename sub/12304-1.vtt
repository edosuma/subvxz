WEBVTT

00:21.955 --> 00:24.572
I'll keep taking
everything you love.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.266
What are you talking about ?

01:13.275 --> 01:15.725
We're returning Riaz
to stand trial in Brazil.

01:17.555 --> 01:18.522
H...

01:19.055 --> 01:20.408
it's our move.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.687
We're going to Brazil.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.227
I know you thought we'd be turning
Antonio Riaz over to you.

02:17.575 --> 02:19.448
- I still do.
- Unfortunately,

02:19.455 --> 02:21.368
Mr. Riaz is about to become
a free man.

02:21.386 --> 02:23.313
You can't free that man.
He murdered my sister.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.019
To charge Mr. Riaz, we require

02:25.018 --> 02:27.484
a list of all witnesses
and contact information.

02:27.493 --> 02:29.324
Which we gave to you
six weeks ago.

02:29.337 --> 02:31.740
We gave you the police reports,
the witness statements,

02:31.755 --> 02:34.331
even the crime scene photos.
Everything you needed to go to trial.

02:34.345 --> 02:36.873
Because of his Mala Noche
affiliations, names were omitted.

02:37.048 --> 02:39.382
Your prosecutor sanitized them.

02:44.886 --> 02:47.991
- We believe in witness protection.
- And we believe in full disclosure.

02:47.995 --> 02:50.091
And without that information,
my hands are tied.

02:50.326 --> 02:52.840
Now, you understand
the importance of paperwork.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.602
That man commissioned
the murder of my sister.

02:56.415 --> 02:58.111
You're making a huge mistake.

02:59.037 --> 03:00.142
I am sorry.

03:00.156 --> 03:02.212
Not as sorry
as you're going to be.

03:30.885 --> 03:33.191
I don't think you know how
this is going to end, Caine.

03:33.206 --> 03:35.292
I know exactly how
it's going to end.

03:35.597 --> 03:36.752
Go home.

03:36.775 --> 03:38.161
I will, Antonio,

03:38.626 --> 03:39.881
when this is over.

04:04.867 --> 04:08.251
CSI MIAMI Season 5 Episode 1
"Rio"

05:03.647 --> 05:05.021
Where's Riaz headed ?

05:05.545 --> 05:07.661
My guess is one of the favelas.

05:07.677 --> 05:09.421
The most dangerous
parts of town.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.742
The shanties are built
onto the hillsides.

05:12.107 --> 05:14.533
Cops say rumor is that Riaz
is something like

05:14.557 --> 05:16.563
- the mayor of one of those.
- I have no doubt.

05:17.176 --> 05:19.261
- Which way do you think he's headed ?
- I don't know,

05:19.275 --> 05:21.783
but, Eric...
I know someone who does.

06:05.216 --> 06:06.903
I heard about your wife.

06:09.948 --> 06:11.362
I'm very sorry, Horatio.

06:11.376 --> 06:14.471
Then you know why I'm here :
I'm after a man named Riaz.

06:14.688 --> 06:16.943
I think Raymond
can help me find him.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.752
What makes you think that Ray
has anything to do with that world ?

06:20.757 --> 06:22.751
Because I know Raymond,
Yelina.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.822
A leopard doesn't change
its spots.

06:30.726 --> 06:33.231
I didn't want you to know.
I'm sorry, I...

06:34.267 --> 06:36.842
- You sent us here for a clean start.
- It's not your fault.

06:37.176 --> 06:38.612
Could we go inside, please ?

06:46.018 --> 06:47.673
I'm scared,
Horatio.

06:49.296 --> 06:52.171
- I think he's gone over completely.
- Does he go to the favelas ?

06:52.196 --> 06:53.260
Drugs.

06:54.977 --> 06:56.941
He says he only collects
payment, but...

06:57.806 --> 06:59.540
I don't believe him.
He comes home,

06:59.556 --> 07:01.293
changes clothes,
disappears again.

07:01.307 --> 07:03.400
I think he deals with
people at high levels.

07:03.666 --> 07:04.952
Is he with Riaz ?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.810
With Riaz ?
Against Riaz ?

07:07.466 --> 07:08.383
I don't know.

07:08.968 --> 07:10.650
He says he does
it for us.

07:10.817 --> 07:12.282
That's a lie.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.290
The only person
Ray Caine cares about

07:14.708 --> 07:15.791
is Ray Caine.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.520
Don't listen to her,
Uncle Horatio.

07:18.067 --> 07:19.103
She has no idea.

07:19.158 --> 07:20.691
Ray... please.

07:20.716 --> 07:22.343
You're always talking
trash about him.

07:22.928 --> 07:25.190
My dad puts his life on the line
every day for us.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.813
If Dad's with Riaz,
it's because he wants to help us.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.990
Get to school.

07:30.048 --> 07:32.002
Raymond,
do what your mother says.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.011
Go ahead, son.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.053
He idolizes his father.

07:40.598 --> 07:42.723
I'm afraid he's going
to become just like him.

07:42.905 --> 07:43.920
Yelina,

07:44.248 --> 07:45.781
are those Raymond's shoes ?

07:46.017 --> 07:46.613
Yes.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.473
Let me see those,
please.

07:55.186 --> 07:57.110
Could you hold that up, please ?

07:57.468 --> 07:58.842
Just like that.

08:03.888 --> 08:05.120
What are you going to do ?

08:05.688 --> 08:07.440
I'm going to get this
to the lab.

08:20.765 --> 08:21.773
Got it.

08:23.176 --> 08:24.781
You think they'll manage
to find Ray ?

08:24.928 --> 08:27.300
This vegetation will help us
find where he hangs out.

08:28.547 --> 08:29.713
You know,
it suits you.

08:29.856 --> 08:30.730
What ?

08:31.235 --> 08:32.361
Being boss.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.711
It's temporary.

08:33.895 --> 08:36.312
Okay, Lieutenant Duquesne.

08:36.626 --> 08:38.220
Pay scale would be nice, though.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.482
- Find me.
- All right.

08:41.905 --> 08:43.460
Calleigh Duquesne.

08:43.477 --> 08:45.162
Large and in charge.

08:46.208 --> 08:49.061
By large, you know I mean
in terms of your reputation and...

08:49.248 --> 08:50.962
responsibility, and...

08:51.357 --> 08:53.270
You look very beautiful today.

08:53.365 --> 08:55.523
Well, that's a...
that's a nice save.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.903
Let me ask you something.

08:57.027 --> 08:59.521
You  gonna make any changes
while they're gone ? Because...

09:00.176 --> 09:02.062
- you can, you know.
- Like what ?

09:02.287 --> 09:03.682
Like, I don't know...

09:04.898 --> 09:05.720
Like her...

09:05.798 --> 09:08.012
I can't believe
she's a CSI now.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.260
She's worked hard for it, and
history aside, she'll make a good one.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.743
Hey. Just got a call out
on a female vic in Coral Gables.

09:17.086 --> 09:18.570
What are you waiting for ?

09:18.905 --> 09:19.610
N o.

09:19.987 --> 09:22.373
There's nothing that says
I got to take a trainee with me.

09:22.385 --> 09:23.833
Okay ?
I mean, I can...

09:23.848 --> 09:25.922
I can process a crime scene
myself, thank you.

09:25.938 --> 09:27.832
That's true, but you won't.

09:28.158 --> 09:30.590
Are you sure you want this
to be your first act as...

09:30.605 --> 09:32.671
- boss for the day ?
- It's my fifth.

09:32.685 --> 09:33.763
Get  going.

09:41.006 --> 09:43.540
- How's Brazil ?
- Ah, the leaf.

09:44.557 --> 09:47.891
The petioles are hidden and
the lamina are ten centimeters.

09:47.936 --> 09:49.732
It's a Drosera villosa.

09:49.746 --> 09:51.750
This thing's carnivorous, so

09:51.918 --> 09:53.933
we are looking at
the face of a killer.

09:54.337 --> 09:56.653
That's interesting.
Can it be found in Rio ?

09:56.668 --> 09:58.873
I doubt it. It's indigenous
to the rain forest.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.693
Their job just got a lot harder.

10:02.775 --> 10:03.883
Calleigh.
Hey.

10:03.887 --> 10:05.600
Hey, how's it going ?

10:05.628 --> 10:08.200
<i>- It's been tough.
- Is everything okay ?</i>

10:08.235 --> 10:10.283
No. They released Riaz.

10:10.297 --> 10:12.282
I heard.
What's it like down there ?

10:12.295 --> 10:15.450
It's beautiful. It couldn't be farther
from Miami other than the weather.

10:15.465 --> 10:18.041
Everywhere you turn,
there's a skyscraper or mountain.

10:18.286 --> 10:19.970
Shantytowns here,
they wield all the power.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.853
They've already had two
police actions today.

10:21.857 --> 10:24.020
And what about the people ?
The people are great.

10:24.025 --> 10:25.361
Are they
just everywhere ?

10:25.377 --> 10:27.372
No, that's the thing :
11 million and,

10:27.386 --> 10:29.180
it feels less crowded
than Miami.

10:29.185 --> 10:31.111
- It's like they're waiting for something.
- For what ?

10:31.387 --> 10:33.733
I don't know. I don't know
if I want to find out.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.813
Look, what have you got
on Ray's location ?

10:36.065 --> 10:38.293
<i>I am confused but
why are you looking for Ray ?</i>

10:39.146 --> 10:41.150
<i>Because we hear
he's with Riaz.</i>

10:41.438 --> 10:43.523
<i>Bad news.
The leaf, it's a...</i>

10:43.780 --> 10:45.559
Drosera villosa.

10:45.558 --> 10:47.724
It's indigenous to the rain forest,
which means

10:47.733 --> 10:49.344
he's working outside the city.

10:49.356 --> 10:51.832
I forgot to tell you.
Rio has an inner-city rain forest.

10:51.837 --> 10:53.683
It's right next to one favella.

10:53.765 --> 10:56.643
Oh, well, in that case,
I'm glad we could help you.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.621
A forest in the middle
of Rio, Eric ?

11:08.625 --> 11:11.090
Yeah. Favella starts
right up here.

11:12.768 --> 11:13.960
Hold a second !

11:15.608 --> 11:17.522
- You hear that ?
- I do hear that.

11:18.505 --> 11:19.493
Come on.

11:41.228 --> 11:42.543
He's alive.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.283
H...

11:47.268 --> 11:48.630
it's your brother.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.550
Get help, Eric.

11:53.918 --> 11:56.321
Easy, easy.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.153
All right.

12:02.035 --> 12:03.871
- Big brother ?
- Yeah.

12:04.096 --> 12:05.081
Ray.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.593
Ray, who did this to you ?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.001
Riaz.

12:15.098 --> 12:17.043
I just wanted
to help my family.

12:17.078 --> 12:19.543
Right now,
let me help you, okay ?

12:20.438 --> 12:21.342
Not me...

12:21.927 --> 12:24.423
- He doesn't understand.
- Ray...

12:24.427 --> 12:27.023
- He's just a kid.
- I know. I want you to let me worry

12:27.036 --> 12:29.112
- about Ray Jr.
- You have to help him.

12:29.188 --> 12:31.310
Riaz has got
his hooks in him.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.491
He's in danger.

12:32.516 --> 12:35.222
I want you to listen to me,
I'm going to take care of that boy.

12:35.456 --> 12:37.281
Ray, okay ?

12:50.496 --> 12:51.881
I'm going to take care of him.

13:00.495 --> 13:01.961
I love you.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.352
The authorities
have his body.

13:40.105 --> 13:42.172
I'm making the arrangements
right now.

13:44.015 --> 13:46.231
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:48.006 --> 13:50.900
Somehow, I always knew
he would end up like this.

13:51.878 --> 13:53.463
Yelina, there's
one other thing.

13:55.706 --> 13:57.302
Ray Jr.
Is he okay ?

13:57.307 --> 13:59.641
- Where is he ?
- I can find him.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.801
You gave him a GPS watch.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.840
When he started hanging around
with those favella boys,

14:09.855 --> 14:12.011
I was scared something
like this would happen.

14:15.628 --> 14:17.013
BONDE.

14:17.245 --> 14:18.812
That's the elevated rail.

14:19.188 --> 14:21.731
- By the aqueduct.
- That's Riaz country.

14:49.918 --> 14:52.610
This is my new man in town.
I want you to remember him, okay ?

14:53.865 --> 14:54.783
Hey, Ray.

14:56.445 --> 14:57.282
Ray.

14:58.175 --> 14:59.903
Ray, this is not a good idea.

15:00.037 --> 15:01.903
I think he's doing fine, Caine.

15:01.905 --> 15:03.003
So are you.

15:03.398 --> 15:04.580
You found me.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.771
Ray, I want you to come
with me.

15:06.787 --> 15:07.940
Stay out of this.

15:08.186 --> 15:09.870
- You don't understand.
- I do understand,

15:09.887 --> 15:12.043
and that's why I want you
to come with me.

15:15.718 --> 15:17.102
I told you, Caine.

15:17.497 --> 15:20.063
I was going to take
everything you loved.

15:22.776 --> 15:23.900
Ray !

15:25.577 --> 15:27.281
Ray !

16:04.397 --> 16:06.750
That trolley heads
into the heart of the favellas

16:06.917 --> 16:09.433
- most dangerous part of the town.
- Then you know what Eric ?

16:09.768 --> 16:11.313
that's where we are gonna go.

16:25.168 --> 16:27.540
All we have is Ray Jr.'s watch

16:27.557 --> 16:29.632
- to go on, huh ?
- That's it.

16:33.935 --> 16:36.100
There's a blue substance
smeared on here.

16:38.637 --> 16:41.382
Pepper. It smells like pepper spray
but that doesn't explain the color.

16:41.385 --> 16:44.161
Not true, Eric.
They use it to stop riots.

16:50.768 --> 16:53.311
That's right, the bullet fires
a combination of the two.

16:53.328 --> 16:55.012
The dye identifies
the agitators.

16:55.028 --> 16:57.290
We find this morning's
police action,

16:57.576 --> 17:00.040
we find that favella and Riaz.

17:30.605 --> 17:32.983
This beauty is Pamela Silvers.

17:33.295 --> 17:36.371
First responders say
her husband Carl found her.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.463
It's a botched robbery ?

17:39.535 --> 17:40.973
That's what he's saying.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.620
She's beaten pretty bad.

17:42.638 --> 17:44.650
- Yeah.
- C. O. D's head trauma, right ?

17:44.888 --> 17:46.080
See these ?

17:46.115 --> 17:48.340
Thin rings of blood on her lips ?

17:48.365 --> 17:49.751
That's expiration.

17:50.747 --> 17:52.923
Now, I think
her lungs collapsed...

17:53.245 --> 17:55.503
sending blood
into her esophagus.

17:55.578 --> 17:57.593
Her saliva mixed with the blood,

17:57.605 --> 17:59.421
creating these droplets,

18:00.017 --> 18:01.872
eventually leading to full

18:01.875 --> 18:03.911
esophogeal blockage.

18:04.046 --> 18:05.900
She drowned
in her own blood.

18:07.047 --> 18:08.252
Okay, I'll start collection.

18:08.267 --> 18:10.122
You start over there
with the murder weapon.

18:10.147 --> 18:12.561
You photo, you sketch, you measure
before you collect anything,

18:12.575 --> 18:14.373
- you got that ?
- Got it, check.

18:32.475 --> 18:34.253
Do you recognize this,
Mr. Silvers ?

18:34.926 --> 18:37.642
That's the shirt you made me
take off at my house.

18:39.158 --> 18:41.002
And you see the tiny bubbles
in the blood ?

18:41.018 --> 18:42.402
That's your wife's saliva,

18:42.528 --> 18:43.930
which can only be there

18:44.015 --> 18:45.763
if you were there
while she was alive.

18:46.275 --> 18:47.092
All right ?

18:47.467 --> 18:49.650
You told me she was dead
when you got home.

18:50.795 --> 18:51.560
Okay.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.843
Okay, okay, she was flailing.

18:55.456 --> 18:57.663
But I tried.
Okay, I tried to save her.

18:58.866 --> 19:01.160
Hang on, Honey. Hang on.
I've called an ambulance.

19:03.426 --> 19:05.731
And you...
didn't tell us this why ?

19:05.756 --> 19:07.741
Because I thought
it would make me look guilty.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.713
Mr. Wolfe, let's tell
the man what he won.

19:09.927 --> 19:12.611
I swear...
All right. I-I gave her CPR

19:12.616 --> 19:15.313
until the paramedics arrived,
but it was too late.

19:16.867 --> 19:18.243
It's never too late.

19:19.887 --> 19:21.873
Okay. Let's start
from when you got home.

19:25.747 --> 19:26.951
Can I help you ?

19:28.127 --> 19:29.492
That man killed
my mother.

19:30.656 --> 19:32.392
Carl Silvers is your father ?

19:32.608 --> 19:33.730
Stepfather.

19:34.395 --> 19:35.631
He killed her,
didn't he ?

19:36.235 --> 19:38.202
Well, I assure you
that we're on top of it.

19:38.687 --> 19:40.251
And those guys in there,
they're very good.

19:40.456 --> 19:41.620
They'll get him.

19:41.827 --> 19:43.070
- Okay ?
- Okay.

19:43.088 --> 19:45.502
But you really shouldn't be
in here right now, all right ?

19:52.606 --> 19:54.442
How'd  it go in interrogation ?

19:54.765 --> 19:57.433
Husband's sticking to his story
and I can't budge him.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.341
Well, he may just
have a good reason.

19:59.357 --> 20:01.151
All physical evidence
is equivocal.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.483
So if the evidence isn't
telling us anything,

20:04.555 --> 20:06.202
- what do you got ?
- Meet air DNA.

20:06.218 --> 20:08.223
It captures and analyses
the signatures

20:08.236 --> 20:11.582
- of any volatile organic compounds.
- So anything airborne.

20:12.116 --> 20:14.462
- Basically any invisible evidence.
- So the killer...?

20:14.478 --> 20:17.292
Could have left behind some evidence
he didn't even know existed.

20:17.307 --> 20:19.791
Such as cologne
or aftershave.

20:19.797 --> 20:21.503
You already processed
her clothes ?

20:21.518 --> 20:22.450
Yeah.

20:28.178 --> 20:30.870
There's benzene,
octyl acetate...

20:31.268 --> 20:32.432
Let me guess,

20:32.916 --> 20:35.181
there's Texanol,
because it's house paint.

20:35.516 --> 20:36.412
Yeah.

20:36.576 --> 20:39.010
I'm such an idiot.
One of the guys we interviewed

20:39.696 --> 20:41.651
was  a painter doing the siding.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.281
Why are you
beating yourself up ?

20:43.305 --> 20:44.870
You just broke the case.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.783
I gave you guys a statement.

20:51.256 --> 20:53.501
We found traces
of the exact paint you used

20:53.516 --> 20:54.990
on the victim's body.

20:55.028 --> 20:57.960
The Z-nose indicates you were
in close proximity to Mrs. Silvers.

20:59.438 --> 21:00.711
Please !

21:04.878 --> 21:07.270
We're executing a search warrant
for your vehicle as we speak.

21:07.285 --> 21:09.661
Do you want to tell me anything
that may help you ?

21:10.938 --> 21:12.653
Yeah. So,

21:12.955 --> 21:15.953
okay. She did come out
and talk to me,

21:16.125 --> 21:18.970
and neighbor ladies only
do that for one reason.

21:19.895 --> 21:21.530
So I went in there at lunch.

21:23.806 --> 21:25.710
Get out of my house.

21:25.746 --> 21:26.982
Come on.

21:32.528 --> 21:34.393
I just want to have
a little fun.

21:34.406 --> 21:36.543
Please, please !

21:38.435 --> 21:40.781
Nothing gets me angrier...

21:41.966 --> 21:43.442
than a tease.

21:44.825 --> 21:45.900
Sue me.

21:47.146 --> 21:48.830
I will do more than that.

22:00.616 --> 22:02.700
I'm going to go and
bury my wife now.

22:02.715 --> 22:04.711
I'm really sorry,
Mr. Silvers.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.062
But you understand,
we have to follow protocol,

22:07.088 --> 22:08.420
- procedures.
- No.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.033
No, I don't
have to understand.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.292
"We are so sorry."
Did you just apologize to him ?

22:19.815 --> 22:21.071
Yeah, I...

22:21.138 --> 22:23.690
okay... I know, I know. I'm supposed
to leave the emotion

22:23.705 --> 22:26.493
- out of it.
- If you knew, you wouldn't do it.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.700
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm new.

22:42.346 --> 22:44.340
Let's go.

22:44.495 --> 22:45.202
Come on

22:46.118 --> 22:47.140
Hold still.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.291
Scott ?!

22:49.746 --> 22:50.802
You said they'd get him.

22:51.276 --> 22:52.900
- You promised.
- Come on move.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.542
Did you tell him his
stepfather did this ?

22:54.545 --> 22:56.553
No, I didn't !
I don't...

22:56.566 --> 22:57.972
I don't know, I don't know...

22:58.037 --> 22:59.580
- I don't think so.
- You don't know

22:59.585 --> 23:00.611
You don't think so ?
What is it ?

23:00.628 --> 23:02.270
The kid thought
that the husband did it.

23:02.287 --> 23:04.511
Just because your
husband was a bastard

23:04.525 --> 23:06.291
doesn't mean that they all are.

23:07.695 --> 23:09.271
That's low, Ryan.

23:09.285 --> 23:10.773
No, Natalia, that's low.

23:41.168 --> 23:42.973
Chief Braga said that
this was the location

23:42.988 --> 23:45.500
of the police action this
morning after Riaz's release.

23:45.518 --> 23:47.592
Than  Ray Jr. can't be far.

24:09.338 --> 24:10.650
They know you are cops.

24:11.585 --> 24:13.211
You better go.
There's danger.

24:13.446 --> 24:14.550
Where's Riaz ?

24:15.015 --> 24:16.243
He is usually there.

24:17.217 --> 24:19.631
Not now.
He's waiting for collections.

24:19.647 --> 24:20.471
Where ?

24:20.987 --> 24:23.020
We light bottle rockets off

24:23.035 --> 24:24.811
in different city areas.

24:25.467 --> 24:27.800
He sees, and others collect.

24:27.806 --> 24:29.880
For the heroin that you
package and sell.

24:39.696 --> 24:41.592
Only one place you can see
the whole city from

24:41.605 --> 24:43.021
that's the hill of Corcovado.

24:43.038 --> 24:44.443
Was he with a boy ?

24:46.468 --> 24:47.720
I'm going to ask you again.

24:47.735 --> 24:48.792
Where's the boy ?

24:51.015 --> 24:53.883
He got into an auto...
with a lady.

24:53.966 --> 24:54.923
What lady ?

24:55.248 --> 24:56.290
A pretty lady.

24:56.885 --> 24:58.762
And other boys, like me.

24:58.825 --> 25:00.011
Where were they heading ?

25:05.556 --> 25:06.791
- Ciao.
- Hey,

25:06.835 --> 25:07.453
Hey !

25:13.277 --> 25:14.673
I got to find that boy.

25:25.997 --> 25:28.312
- Have you found him ?
- He got into a car with a woman.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.890
Did he say anything
to you about it ?

25:29.928 --> 25:32.172
No. But he left his
backpack behind,

25:32.195 --> 25:34.010
and he never leaves
the house without it.

25:34.026 --> 25:35.053
Scotch tape,

25:35.468 --> 25:37.043
carbon paper and...

25:37.168 --> 25:39.763
Why would anyone cut off
the tips of latex gloves ?

25:39.776 --> 25:41.472
To make heroin pellets.

25:47.635 --> 25:50.300
Are you saying my son
is muling drugs ?

25:55.456 --> 25:56.480
Excuse me.

25:57.245 --> 25:58.193
Horatio.

25:58.995 --> 26:00.460
I've been better.

26:00.878 --> 26:01.941
Is Delko with you ?

26:01.955 --> 26:03.150
No, he's not.
Why ?

26:03.408 --> 26:04.622
<i>His signal just died.</i>

26:04.637 --> 26:06.171
I've been monitoring you guys.

26:06.187 --> 26:06.840
<i>Okay,</i>

26:06.888 --> 26:08.083
I know where to find him.

26:08.105 --> 26:09.060
I got to go.

27:17.395 --> 27:18.801
Antonio,

27:18.835 --> 27:20.931
I unwisely showed you compassion

27:20.947 --> 27:22.511
the last time we met.

27:22.827 --> 27:24.783
This time,
you won't be so lucky.

27:24.808 --> 27:26.500
Where is my nephew ?

27:26.516 --> 27:28.340
You'll never find
your nephew.

27:32.856 --> 27:34.203
Easy, Eric.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.430
Easy.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.480
Now, Antonio,

27:37.587 --> 27:39.371
this is your last chance.

27:39.677 --> 27:41.001
Where's my nephew ?

27:41.295 --> 27:43.570
You still don't
understand, huh, Caine ?

27:49.336 --> 27:50.262
Don't I ?

27:51.148 --> 27:52.612
Don't I, Antonio ?

28:15.478 --> 28:16.483
Scribble.

28:17.266 --> 28:18.401
"Flag L."

28:19.617 --> 28:21.181
That's Flagler, Eric.

28:21.636 --> 28:23.820
It's got to be
where he sent Ray Jr.

28:23.837 --> 28:25.392
I'd bet money on it.

28:25.617 --> 28:26.920
We headed home ?

28:27.195 --> 28:28.671
We are going home.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.121
I didn't tell
Scott Satlin anything.

28:42.707 --> 28:45.641
Did he or did he not see
his stepfather in interrogation ?

28:45.656 --> 28:48.151
He did. But I didn't know
it was his son until he told me.

28:48.175 --> 28:50.973
But the second you found out,
you should have taken him outside.

28:51.788 --> 28:53.121
I know that now.

28:53.267 --> 28:56.051
His attorney is pleading
the insanity defense.

28:56.066 --> 28:58.011
He claims you put him
in a murderous state.

28:58.017 --> 28:59.472
Okay, so think.

28:59.528 --> 29:01.073
What exactly did
you say to him ?

29:01.465 --> 29:03.743
I told him that
Tripp and Ryan were good

29:03.957 --> 29:04.931
and that we'd get him.

29:04.946 --> 29:07.292
- "Him" as in the stepfather ?
- "Him" as in the killer.

29:07.388 --> 29:08.311
Are you sure ?

29:10.756 --> 29:11.961
I don't... I don't know.

29:12.235 --> 29:14.881
Okay, look, Boa Vista, your career
isn't over because of this,

29:14.917 --> 29:16.731
but you see how
hard things can be

29:16.745 --> 29:19.243
when people take what
you say out of context.

29:19.335 --> 29:20.952
That's a mole dig, isn't it ?

29:21.028 --> 29:23.122
No. No, it absolutely isn't.

29:23.188 --> 29:24.451
It's a reality.

29:25.306 --> 29:26.731
We're on the
same team now.

29:26.805 --> 29:28.643
We present a unified
front to the world,

29:28.667 --> 29:31.421
regardless of how we're
feeling at the moment, okay ?

29:31.528 --> 29:34.781
I-I never... explicitly said

29:34.828 --> 29:36.040
the stepfather did it.

29:37.288 --> 29:39.233
we've got one question
left to answer.

29:39.518 --> 29:40.182
What ?

29:40.605 --> 29:41.993
Where'd Scott get the firearm ?

29:44.086 --> 29:44.892
Hey.

29:45.507 --> 29:47.561
I heard you were here.
Welcome back.

29:47.858 --> 29:48.623
Thanks.

29:48.986 --> 29:52.223
So, I heard it didn't go down
like it was supposed to.

29:52.846 --> 29:55.242
Courts dropped the ball,
let Riaz out ?

29:56.408 --> 29:57.082
Yeah.

29:57.728 --> 30:00.122
But, uh, we took
care of it.

30:02.225 --> 30:03.111
You okay ?

30:07.197 --> 30:08.832
It doesn't bring Marisol back.

30:09.206 --> 30:10.392
I know, Eric.

30:10.618 --> 30:13.022
Look, if there's anything
I can do, anything at all...

30:13.285 --> 30:14.852
There isn't, but thanks, Alexx.

30:16.365 --> 30:18.981
I got to get to Questioned
Documents, okay ?

30:19.035 --> 30:20.123
See you later.

30:24.018 --> 30:24.763
Calleigh.

30:25.377 --> 30:27.272
Hey. Got anything
on the Satlin case ?

30:27.285 --> 30:28.531
Found a theft report.

30:28.566 --> 30:30.951
The guy's condo was
broken into four days ago.

30:31.927 --> 30:34.023
Only item missing
is a nine-mil.

30:34.067 --> 30:35.863
Yeah, and take a look
at that address.

30:35.928 --> 30:37.721
Gun owner resides
in the Keys.

30:38.528 --> 30:41.481
Looks like I need to have another
conversation with Scott Satlin.

30:43.736 --> 30:45.663
Do you remember anything
about the shooting ?

30:45.698 --> 30:46.440
Barely.

30:47.127 --> 30:48.361
I saw him, and then...

30:50.135 --> 30:51.211
just black.

30:52.745 --> 30:53.960
Then I was cuffed.

30:54.077 --> 30:55.863
Do you remember
stealing the gun ?

30:57.218 --> 30:57.892
What ?

30:58.196 --> 31:00.460
The gun you used,
you stole it four days ago.

31:02.656 --> 31:03.430
Scott.

31:05.016 --> 31:05.743
What ?

31:06.067 --> 31:08.081
You told Homicide
that you had been in the Keys.

31:08.097 --> 31:09.642
That's where
the gun was stolen.

31:09.675 --> 31:12.053
It was reported three days ago
when you were down there.

31:13.715 --> 31:16.023
I stole the gun from the
neighbor at the beach house

31:16.035 --> 31:18.351
for protection,
from my step-dad.

31:20.818 --> 31:22.112
Let me tell you something.

31:23.246 --> 31:25.492
People who fail
an insanity defense

31:25.496 --> 31:27.922
are five times more likely
to get a life sentence

31:27.937 --> 31:30.221
than those who just simply
admit they're guilty.

31:35.075 --> 31:36.391
I hated that man.

31:37.188 --> 31:39.541
He made my mother
so unhappy.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.213
She called me
while I was on vacation.

31:42.468 --> 31:43.933
Said he threatened to hit her.

31:44.198 --> 31:47.351
And when you saw Boa Vista, you found
a chance to hide behind insanity.

31:51.937 --> 31:54.021
It was wrong, I know.

31:55.495 --> 31:57.820
Incidentally,
so are my statistics.

31:57.955 --> 32:01.011
Frankly, I haven't a clue
which way the jury will rule.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.420
Get him out of here.

32:21.186 --> 32:22.123
Hey. Anything ?

32:22.135 --> 32:24.132
It's just going to
take one minute, Eric.

32:24.316 --> 32:26.071
These kids are like
a ticking time bomb.

32:26.098 --> 32:29.191
I know. Just give me one second here.
How much you figure they're carrying ?

32:29.205 --> 32:31.310
25 pellets per of
compressed powder heroin.

32:31.328 --> 32:33.632
It's a million dollars a kid,
provided they don't burst.

32:33.636 --> 32:35.552
Right from their
stomach acid.

32:35.937 --> 32:38.701
Once heroin enters the system,
it shuts everything down.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.833
Blood stops flowing,
lungs stop breathing,

32:42.905 --> 32:43.981
kid stops living.

32:44.017 --> 32:46.131
Which is exactly why
I need this to go faster.

32:46.147 --> 32:48.122
One of those kids is
Horatio's nephew.

32:48.228 --> 32:50.792
2-0-2-8-1 Flagler.

32:50.806 --> 32:52.531
Does that address
mean anything to you ?

32:53.795 --> 32:55.371
That's where
they're hiding the kids.

33:03.388 --> 33:04.101
Ma'am.

33:04.865 --> 33:05.682
Ma'am ?

33:07.058 --> 33:08.532
Stand back, please.

33:10.046 --> 33:11.330
I didn't do this.

33:22.895 --> 33:24.003
It's not Ray.

33:25.966 --> 33:27.470
Well, it's somebody's son.

33:31.137 --> 33:33.191
All right, tell us again
how it all happened.

33:33.518 --> 33:35.322
I escort these boys for Riaz.

33:35.326 --> 33:37.121
I drop them off,
and then I return home.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.831
I only come up here
for my family.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.983
- The money is very good.
- And illegal.

33:53.397 --> 33:55.251
I know.
I'm so ashamed.

33:55.558 --> 33:56.831
How did you get up here ?

33:57.047 --> 33:58.161
Charter flight.

33:58.888 --> 34:00.092
Private airfield.

34:00.976 --> 34:02.450
I drove the boys here,

34:04.077 --> 34:06.983
and then this one boy
he started to sweat.

34:07.418 --> 34:09.013
He looked so sick.

34:09.337 --> 34:11.011
There is a number
that I'm told to call.

34:11.027 --> 34:12.152
Then what happened ?

34:12.188 --> 34:13.232
A man came...

34:14.978 --> 34:16.681
and he did that to the boy.

34:20.496 --> 34:22.489
He cut open the boy
to get the pellets.

34:22.505 --> 34:24.572
All he cared about
were the drugs.

34:27.947 --> 34:29.572
What about the other two boys ?

34:29.576 --> 34:30.513
They ran.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.933
I didn't stop them.
I was afraid for their lives.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.920
How do you get in
contact this man ?

34:35.527 --> 34:37.172
With this cell phone.

34:37.288 --> 34:38.702
Redial it, Eric.

34:47.427 --> 34:48.402
Eric ?

35:01.777 --> 35:04.240
See this little tiny bit
of circuitry right there ?

35:05.566 --> 35:08.650
That is like a teeny, tiny
cheese grater for epithelials.

35:17.688 --> 35:19.192
Well, let's hope it pans out.

35:44.236 --> 35:47.022
Angel Demorte.
Works with Tiago Matos.

35:47.366 --> 35:48.961
He's a big-time Miami mover.

35:49.017 --> 35:50.253
Not Mala Noche, though ?

35:50.318 --> 35:52.600
Means Riaz was dealing
outside of his gang.

35:54.167 --> 35:56.522
If you bring in Angel,
maybe you can get to Matos.

35:57.667 --> 35:58.293
H,

35:58.905 --> 35:59.851
we got a lead.

36:01.737 --> 36:03.413
You guys got nothing.

36:03.437 --> 36:04.411
<i>Cabron</i>

36:04.845 --> 36:06.831
We found the murder
weapon on you, Angel.

36:06.847 --> 36:08.980
Keep telling you to help yourself out
and give us something

36:08.998 --> 36:11.000
to charge Tiago Matos with.

36:11.538 --> 36:13.940
I do that,
I sign my death warrant.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.702
Well, it's you or the state.
Doesn't matter to me.

36:19.717 --> 36:21.521
Man, you got
the wrong guy.

36:21.555 --> 36:22.472
<i>Me entiende</i>

36:24.028 --> 36:25.222
Lieutenant Caine ?

36:25.228 --> 36:27.212
Tiago Matos.

36:27.216 --> 36:30.351
- Where are you taking my driver ?
- I'm taking him to prison.

36:30.705 --> 36:33.301
He murdered a young
boy over your drugs.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.530
If you know so much,
why am I still a free man ?

36:35.546 --> 36:37.033
Because I want it that way.

36:37.045 --> 36:39.702
- Now where are the other two kids ?
- There's two others ?

36:39.726 --> 36:40.942
I don't know...

36:41.468 --> 36:43.052
If they're full of
packets as you say,

36:43.136 --> 36:44.552
the morgue will get them soon.

36:44.567 --> 36:47.683
I sincerely hope for your sake
that doesn't happen, Tiago.

36:47.796 --> 36:49.180
Tell you what, Lieutenant.

36:49.305 --> 36:51.760
I'll do better than that.
I help you look.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.910
When I find them, I'll make
sure to give you a call.

36:54.918 --> 36:58.440
Are you sure you wanna waste
that call on me, Tiago ?

37:11.015 --> 37:11.871
Hello.

37:11.987 --> 37:12.692
<i>Mom ?</i>

37:12.746 --> 37:14.242
Ray ! Oh, my God,
where are you ?

37:14.257 --> 37:15.283
I'm okay, Mom.

37:15.447 --> 37:18.011
<i>Ray, honey, I'm in Miami.
I've been looking for you.</i>

37:18.078 --> 37:18.973
You're what ?!

37:19.076 --> 37:21.942
Listen to me. I know what you're doing,
and you're in real danger.

37:21.965 --> 37:23.900
I am if you're here,
Mom. Go home.

37:23.916 --> 37:25.500
Ray, please
listen to me.

37:25.515 --> 37:26.760
I have to do this,

37:26.798 --> 37:27.840
to save Dad.

37:28.218 --> 37:30.012
And if you try to stop me,
they'll kill him.

37:31.306 --> 37:32.672
About your father, I...

37:32.927 --> 37:34.223
There's something
I have to tell you.

37:34.226 --> 37:35.323
<i>I don't want to hear it.</i>

37:35.337 --> 37:38.001
And don't try to trace this call,'cause
I'm throwing this phone away.

37:38.016 --> 37:39.943
Ray, please. Ray !

37:44.607 --> 37:46.082
What else did he say ?

37:46.287 --> 37:47.680
Nothing, unfortunately.

37:47.687 --> 37:49.522
Just said he was trying
to save his father.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.981
- At least we know he's still alive.
- There's more.

37:52.458 --> 37:55.012
I got in touch with one
of his friends, Dominic.

37:55.096 --> 37:56.510
Dominic. Okay.

37:56.706 --> 37:58.931
Dominic gave Ray Jr. a gun.

37:59.528 --> 38:00.793
And there's one more thing.

38:01.118 --> 38:01.932
Pablo,

38:02.098 --> 38:04.871
one of the boys Ray traveled
from Brazil with, got sick.

38:10.808 --> 38:12.960
- He's in a hospital.
- What do you mean sick ?

38:13.128 --> 38:14.333
He's in surgery.

38:14.455 --> 38:16.561
They're removing
their heroin pellets.

38:34.047 --> 38:35.380
We'll talk later.

38:41.065 --> 38:42.972
Is this what H got
at the hospital ?

38:43.295 --> 38:45.450
Yeah, from the
third kid, Pablo.

38:45.488 --> 38:47.222
Okay, so what exactly
are we looking for ?

38:47.235 --> 38:50.411
If we can find a byproduct in these
things, we can target it on the street.

38:50.688 --> 38:53.000
Okay.
So what's all this ?

38:53.235 --> 38:55.331
It's the wax,
it's the tape.

38:55.336 --> 38:56.773
and there's a carbon layer.

38:56.777 --> 38:59.640
And there's the tip of the latex glove
it was originally packed in.

39:00.445 --> 39:01.601
Hang on a second.

39:18.976 --> 39:19.891
You got a print.

39:19.906 --> 39:23.001
That was packed in Brazil, so I'm not
sure how a print's going to help us.

39:23.508 --> 39:25.062
Has a print ever hurt us ?

39:27.697 --> 39:29.203
You lied to us, Ana.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.223
About what ?

39:30.228 --> 39:32.440
An innocent chaperone
to these kids ?

39:32.748 --> 39:34.791
You packed those pills
down in Brazil.

39:34.837 --> 39:36.243
I did nothing of the sort.

39:36.568 --> 39:38.813
That's funny because
we found your print

39:39.308 --> 39:41.202
packed inside one
of these heroin pellets.

39:50.287 --> 39:51.551
If I pack them,

39:52.176 --> 39:53.490
they pay me triple.

39:54.296 --> 39:56.010
The money is too good to say no.

39:56.015 --> 39:57.651
So you put these
kids'lives at risk.

39:57.667 --> 39:58.833
They're no angels,

39:58.855 --> 40:01.623
- believe me.
- One of these kids was killed, Ana.

40:03.347 --> 40:05.761
- That never happened before.
- And it's not going to happen again,

40:05.777 --> 40:07.341
I can assure you.

40:12.807 --> 40:13.960
It's Delko.

40:15.865 --> 40:16.970
All right. Thanks.

40:18.358 --> 40:20.421
H, the kid in the hospital
he's conscious.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.610
He knows where Ray is meeting
Matos to give him the drugs.

40:55.916 --> 40:57.182
I want my dad.

40:57.486 --> 40:59.462
After you give me
what I came for.

41:00.658 --> 41:01.702
Gentlemen,

41:01.827 --> 41:03.161
put your weapons down.

41:03.178 --> 41:04.203
I want my dad.

41:04.216 --> 41:06.063
Matos, put it down.
You too, Ray.

41:06.078 --> 41:07.401
Let me speak to my dad.

41:07.415 --> 41:09.490
Ray.
Ray, your dad is gone.

41:10.615 --> 41:12.020
He's gone, son.

41:12.778 --> 41:14.472
- You killed him ?!
- Ray.

41:15.048 --> 41:16.632
- Ray, don't do it.
- No.

41:16.647 --> 41:18.912
- He deserves to die.
- If you cross this line,

41:18.928 --> 41:20.803
you can't come back, son.

41:21.527 --> 41:22.561
Shoot me.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.363
- Shoot me, or I'll shoot you.
- Ray,

41:25.385 --> 41:28.352
this is the last thing that your dad
would want you to do.

41:28.595 --> 41:29.953
You got to believe me.

41:30.047 --> 41:31.483
I want you to put it down.

41:32.936 --> 41:33.982
Put it down !

41:36.038 --> 41:36.900
Put it down.

41:38.936 --> 41:40.170
Very good.

41:42.175 --> 41:43.112
Hey !

42:11.618 --> 42:12.852
You okay, son ?

42:16.045 --> 42:17.162
Are you okay ?

42:21.746 --> 42:22.982
I'm okay.

42:24.797 --> 42:26.020
I'm okay.

42:34.067 --> 42:36.533
Why don't you...
catch the car ?

42:40.628 --> 42:42.690
- Bye, Uncle Horatio.
- See you soon.

42:48.737 --> 42:49.481
Raymond ?

42:49.496 --> 42:51.890
His body is being
transported as we speak.

42:53.268 --> 42:54.802
There's a Brazilian term.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.312
<i>Saudade.</i>

42:57.588 --> 43:00.232
It's the sadness we feel
for happy memories.

43:01.685 --> 43:04.310
Like I have for Ray and
you have for Marisol.

43:05.615 --> 43:06.823
What are you going to do ?

43:08.205 --> 43:11.103
Brazil is saudade now, too.

43:12.415 --> 43:14.511
Although I'm not really sure
what there is here for us.

43:14.517 --> 43:15.442
I do.

43:15.906 --> 43:16.570
What ?

43:17.007 --> 43:18.041
Family.
