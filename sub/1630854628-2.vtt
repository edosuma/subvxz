MADISON: Apart from having
'Keeks' as a nickname,

00:23.175 --> 00:24.555
she doesn't seem too suss.

00:24.655 --> 00:26.235
I said I don't care.

00:26.335 --> 00:28.755
You don't care if someone
hanging out with your kid

00:28.855 --> 00:30.855
is suss or not?

00:35.415 --> 00:38.395
(EXHALES) How did it go down
when you met your stepkids?

00:38.495 --> 00:41.395
(LAUGHS) No, it didn't go down.

00:41.495 --> 00:42.955
The mum wanted to meet me first,

00:43.055 --> 00:45.195
make sure I wasn't a murderer
or whatever.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.795
So we met at this pub,

00:46.895 --> 00:49.995
things got tense between them
and she left.

00:50.095 --> 00:52.035
And I was walking across
the car park

00:52.135 --> 00:53.835
and she hit me with her car.

00:53.935 --> 00:56.355
What?!

00:56.455 --> 00:58.115
It was intense.

00:58.215 --> 01:01.075
And she said she didn't see me
but, like, really?

01:01.175 --> 01:04.075
Was that supposed
to make me feel better?

01:04.175 --> 01:06.175
Oh, hey, look at this.

01:07.015 --> 01:08.195
OK.

01:08.295 --> 01:10.755
Stop making me desperate
by association, please.

01:10.855 --> 01:12.675
Any day now, J might be

01:12.775 --> 01:14.995
accidentally calling
this Keeks bitch Mama.

01:15.095 --> 01:17.175
So, Oly, you ARE desperate.

01:19.735 --> 01:23.435
And she is selling such
a cute vase on Marketplace.

01:23.535 --> 01:25.475
-I hate vases.
-No way.

01:25.575 --> 01:28.675
No, no, today we love vases.

01:28.775 --> 01:30.875
No.

01:30.975 --> 01:34.655
Oh, Oly, you're not even
a tiny bit curious?

01:39.775 --> 01:41.775
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:46.255 --> 01:47.755
Hey there.

01:47.855 --> 01:49.755
Oh, this must be the vase.

01:49.855 --> 01:51.235
Yes, ma'am.

01:51.335 --> 01:53.935
You're not old enough to be
a ma'am. That's embarrassing.

01:55.295 --> 01:56.995
Where did you even
get this thing?

01:57.095 --> 02:00.595
It just, you know...
Things appear.

02:00.695 --> 02:02.635
Is it stolen or something?

02:02.735 --> 02:05.835
No, prob...probably not.

02:05.935 --> 02:07.675
No, it really isn't.

02:07.775 --> 02:09.235
MADISON: OK, spill.

02:09.335 --> 02:12.195
Well, so, last year I had
a big night with my cousins,

02:12.295 --> 02:14.195
and I woke up
and this was in my bed.

02:14.295 --> 02:17.315
-(MADISON LAUGHS) What?
-Yeah, like, I woke up and bam!

02:17.415 --> 02:19.115
There it is on the pillow
next to me.

02:19.215 --> 02:21.115
And I asked
the house party people

02:21.215 --> 02:23.115
and this bar we went to
if it was theirs

02:23.215 --> 02:24.795
and literally put up signs,

02:24.895 --> 02:26.995
and nobody owns it
or knows where it came from.

02:27.095 --> 02:29.195
MADISON: Oh, my God,
I love that.

02:29.295 --> 02:31.715
It's basically how I met
my last boyfriend.

02:31.815 --> 02:34.875
(CHUCKLES) Honestly, like,
I don't hate it. I just...

02:34.975 --> 02:37.475
I tried living with it, and it
just freaks me out too much.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.595
Like, where did it come from?

02:39.695 --> 02:42.075
-I do feel conflicted, though.
-Don't. Don't.

02:42.175 --> 02:43.915
Oh, but seriously, though,

02:44.015 --> 02:46.155
I don't have any money
on me for this.

02:46.255 --> 02:48.275
Oh. You can transfer me.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.875
Oh, my phone's bung.

02:50.975 --> 02:52.675
Is there an ATM nearby?

02:52.775 --> 02:55.355
Oh, good idea. You could stay
here and I'll go get it.

02:55.455 --> 02:57.735
KEEKS: Oh, no, that's OK.
I can come with you.

03:00.775 --> 03:04.415

right...right here.

I better be off.

Yeah, thanks.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.875
-Nice to chat.
-See ya.

without warning,

04:01.855 --> 04:04.635
asked my dad if he'd like
to donate his sperm to her.

-To us.
-Yeah.

she was gonna ask.

04:19.415 --> 04:20.555
No, we talked about it.

remembered that.

forgot about that too.

what I did with Rosa."

it's a coincidence

doing all that

Hmm. Might have
just been the chemo.

always work, though.

that gives you the cancer.

if it's the right kind of thing.

Hello, darling. Can we not do
this on public display, please?

25:12.371 --> 25:13.751
Let me in.

25:13.851 --> 25:15.951
Just because I had cancer

25:16.051 --> 25:18.751
doesn't mean
I stopped needing you.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.551
(STAMMERS)
I drove you everywhere,

25:21.651 --> 25:24.391
and I was at
every single appointment.

25:24.491 --> 25:26.991
You weren't with me.
You weren't with me.

25:27.091 --> 25:32.631
You acted like you were ferrying
around an alien made of glass.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.271
What are you talking about?

25:34.371 --> 25:36.671
Am I seriously
getting into trouble

25:36.771 --> 25:39.631
because I didn't try
to get my rocks off with you

25:39.731 --> 25:41.671
whilst you were sick?

25:41.771 --> 25:43.671
See, that's the problem, Dom.

25:43.771 --> 25:45.911
You wouldn't even consider

25:46.011 --> 25:49.391
that I might have got
some much-needed pleasure too.

25:49.491 --> 25:51.751
-Yep.
-You decided for me.

25:51.851 --> 25:55.951
Or you were worried
you'd catch cancer.

25:56.051 --> 25:58.551
Yeah! Yeah! That's what it was.
That's bullshit!

25:58.651 --> 26:00.951
-Well, how would I know?
-That's not why I was angry.

26:01.051 --> 26:02.271
You wouldn't even talk about it.

26:02.371 --> 26:04.911
I was upset that you were
gonna die, darling!

26:05.011 --> 26:07.011
So was I!

26:08.451 --> 26:10.151
Which is why I don't understand

26:10.251 --> 26:11.831
why you wouldn't do me
the dignity

26:11.931 --> 26:15.111
of admitting
that you found me disgusting

26:15.211 --> 26:16.951
and diseased.

26:17.051 --> 26:19.511
I knew it
but you wouldn't say it.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.271
There was a reason

26:21.371 --> 26:23.711
why I was attracted
to the way he looked at me

26:23.811 --> 26:25.831
and talked to me
and listened to me.

26:25.931 --> 26:29.631
What, like a patient, huh?

26:29.731 --> 26:32.791
No. Like a woman, Dom.

26:32.891 --> 26:36.431
Like a whole woman
right there in front of him.

26:36.531 --> 26:38.951
Yeah, with a few crappy cells,

26:39.051 --> 26:41.691

still be desirable.

27:09.651 --> 27:11.651

around her.

27:12.891 --> 27:14.891
Are you kidding?

27:16.251 --> 27:20.211
You have literally zero respect
for what it's like to be a mum.

27:21.211 --> 27:23.831
I'm pretty sure she was
including you in the rant.

27:23.931 --> 27:27.111
Yeah. Well, at least
I can acknowledge it.

27:27.211 --> 27:29.591
Oh, look at that.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.191
We need her to not see
this kind of thing.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.411
Yeah, I know. I don't want it
to be like this either.

27:46.371 --> 27:48.871
So I think that we should just
use this as a drop-off point

27:48.971 --> 27:51.871
and we can coordinate so that
we don't have to cross paths.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.111
And that way, J doesn't
have to see anything bad

27:54.211 --> 27:56.251
and we can just move on
with our lives.

27:58.131 --> 28:00.671

Is that what you want?

Yeah.
