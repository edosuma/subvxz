00:02.440 --> 00:04.032
I know you. Oliver Trask.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.349
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:08.193
Next time you wanna be alone
with my girlfriend, I can stay home. 

00:08.360 --> 00:11.716
Everybody who knows me
for more than five minutes hates my guts.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.757
- I'm so stupid!
- Take it easy.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.878
So in theory, Julie Cooper
could become your stepmother.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.314
Don't even say it.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.198
I can start over, have a new life.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.272
I never really wanted to be
a financial planner. Or a thief.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.670
I think Jimmy and I might've
gone into business together.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.991
- You are drunk.
- You guys are like brother and sister.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.434
You guys could be related.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.875
- What's wrong?
- I just took a whole bunch of pills.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.838
- We're leaving. See you soon.
- What if he didn't try to kill himself?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.070
- What?
- He wouldn't go to the hospital.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.878
I can't leave him alone tonight.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.156
Just go home,
and I'll see you in the morning.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.835
You did accuse the guy
of faking a suicide attempt.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.309
- No, I didn't. I just didn't believe him.
- Oh, okay.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.710
Hard to believe such blind compassion
upset Marissa.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.029
You should work for UNICEF.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.475
I don't trust him.
Something about Oliver is off.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.790
Yeah. He tried to kill himself.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.554
Or he faked it, man.
Either way, it's pretty off.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.439
Every day it seems Marissa and I
are fighting about this guy.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.510
- I don't even know why.
- Ryan, I'm no girl...

01:04.680 --> 01:08.309
Although I did spend several summers
at Camp Takaho being called such.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.070
- Maybe your jealousy's getting in the way.
- Yeah, except I'm not jealous.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.878
Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

01:14.040 --> 01:17.555
Because Oliver is insanely wealthy
and well-traveled. He's a Dapper Don.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.478
- And I'm not.
- But on the other hand...

01:19.640 --> 01:22.916
...he's also clinically depressed
and chemically dependent. So you know...

01:23.080 --> 01:25.036
...it all comes out in the wash, really.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.910
You want my advice?
Just embrace the friend, man.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.833
- You should make peace with this guy.
- Maybe you're right.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.436
Or, I don't know, you could enjoy
the arguing with Marissa.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.830
Sparks flying. Her yin to your yang.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.351
Could be nice for your relationship.
I'd imagine.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.989
- Why, you and Anna don't fight?
- We're all yang, Ryan.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.516
What would we fight about? We like
the same things, have the same interests.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.636
- It's ridiculous.
- That sounds terrible.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.030
- We're sharing the same brain.
- Not me and Marissa.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.909
Let me ask you something. Am I dating
the female me? Like me, but as a girl?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.672
I don't know. That's disgusting.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.513
True.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.230
- I gotta go.
- Catch you later, Marissa.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.318
- Go what?
- Gotta go embrace the friend.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.277
Hi. Hey.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.191
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.550
- How's Oliver?
- You really want to know?

02:17.960 --> 02:19.473
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.598
He feels bad. He doesn't understand
why he took a bunch of pills...

02:22.760 --> 02:26.116
...and you and I got in a fight over it.
By the way, I don't get it, either.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.713
Right. I know.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.078
And I know I've been
a little weird about everything.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.033
But he's your friend. So he's my friend.

02:35.720 --> 02:40.236
I know. I'm not saying I might not
get weird about it again...

02:40.680 --> 02:41.954
...but I wanna try.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.554
You wanna hang out with him,
you want me to, it's okay.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.871
It's better than okay. It's... It's great.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.878
- Great?
- Yeah, well...

02:50.040 --> 02:52.713
"Great" is probably pushing it a little.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.635
- But definitely good.
- Thanks.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.516
Ryan. Marissa. I want you to meet
our new transfer student.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.398
He says you're all friends.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:47.520 --> 03:48.999
Hey. So I was thinking...

03:49.160 --> 03:52.357
...maybe after school we could
go play a little bit of Jenga. Yeah?

03:52.640 --> 03:54.119
No.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.955
Or we could go get some comics.
We haven't done that in a while.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.678
Okay. We could go to South Coast Plaza
and quietly mock people.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.274
Or why don't we try
and do something different?

04:04.440 --> 04:07.034
Like... Check it out. I got some ideas.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.952
- Muscle-car racing.
- What?

04:09.120 --> 04:12.874
Or we could learn Israeli self-defense.
They call it <i>Krav Maga</i>.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.598
- Seth. Come on.
- <i>Krav Maga</i>.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.829
- What?
- Why don't we go to the IMAX theatre...

04:17.000 --> 04:20.470
...and see the movie on migrating birds?
- IMAX, Anna? We're cooler than that.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.871
I think we're past that. Why don't we
take Luke's Sea-Doo out for a spin?

04:24.040 --> 04:26.508
I'm looking to
branch out into different water sports.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.558
- Okay. I'll support that.
- Good. If not, we can argue about it.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.473
No, I think it's good.
It's important that we change things up.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.359
- We don't want to get boring.
- Good. I think it's important...

04:35.520 --> 04:39.798
...for us to not always do the same stuff
or dress the same, or whatever.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.877
- Damn it.
- Wow.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.199
You take Israeli self-defense.
I'll take muscle cars.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.311
- Got yourself a little deal there.
- Partner.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.359
- Hey.
- Hey. Oliver, what's up, man?

04:53.520 --> 04:55.909
- You visiting Harbor?
- Actually, Oliver goes here now.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.433
Never too late for a new start.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.318
What a surprise.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.830
- You didn't tell anyone?
- I didn't think you meant it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.992
Of course. I have more friends here
than I did at my last school.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.674
Anyways, I'm gonna go wash up.
It's tuna-melt Monday.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.432
- And we love tuna melts.
- Yes, we do.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.158
I was looking forward, though...

05:11.320 --> 05:13.754
...to sampling some of the other items
on the menu.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.349
- Good. That's good. That's great.
- Bye-bye.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.074
I was gonna take Oliver to the bookstore,
since we both have free periods now.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.834
Marissa and I have, like,
the exact same schedule.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.228
- What are the odds?
- Crazy.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.794
Have fun.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.154
Okay. Come on.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.639
Later on.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.196
There it is, man. Tuna melts, Ryan.
What am I gonna have to give up next?

05:37.360 --> 05:38.429
Oliver goes here.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.114
I was trying to talk about myself,
but I did notice.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.477
- You don't find that completely...?
- Embrace the friend, okay?

05:44.640 --> 05:48.792
- I'm sure there's a good explanation.
- Seth. Come on.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.038
I gotta go.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.799
And my 12:00? Right.
The 16-year-old with his third DUI.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.356
What do I have at 6?
The travel agent who falsely advertised...

06:00.520 --> 06:04.433
...the Bahamian beach house. What a day.
All right. Thanks, Cory. Bye.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.995
Four years at Berkeley Law,
15 as a public defender...

06:07.160 --> 06:11.312
...so I could become Judge Judy.
- I like her. She's tough, but fair.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.074
I watch a lot of daytime TV.
What's going on?

06:14.240 --> 06:17.755
- Tomorrow, we're going to lunch.
- You couldn't have told me on the phone?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.029
At the Lighthouse.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.077
Yeah, except for
the Lighthouse is closed.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.356
- Forever.
- Well, I got them to open it up again.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.590
So we could take a look,
make sure we wanna buy it.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.399
- Are you serious?
- I sure am. You can thank me later.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.792
We were five martinis deep, we were
joking. There was singing involved.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.996
I remember.
You alienated several waitresses.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.237
- Well, that one liked me.
- You were drunk.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.960
That's my point.
We cannot open a restaurant.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.509
- That's crazy.
- Why? Why is that so crazy?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.477
We don't know anything
about running one.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.551
You managed the Lighthouse
for two years.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.994
Two summers.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.470
And I was stoned and drunk, in college.
It was the '80s.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.596
You might wanna keep that
from the investors.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.558
- Restaurants fail.
- Not all of them.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.790
- I don't have the capital.
- I'm working on that.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.873
- Look, it's not a good time for me.
- That's exactly my point.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.998
If you don't find something soon,
the next stop for you is Phoenix.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.469
The way I look at it,
you got nothing to lose.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.232
And we both have everything to gain.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.472
So, come on.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

07:14.840 --> 07:18.150
- I'm sorry. I can't do lunch today.
- But what about tomorrow?

07:18.320 --> 07:19.719
It's a little hectic right now.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.111
The Fred Segal sale is happening.
I was thinking maybe Nobu. A road trip.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.918
That's even less likely than lunch.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.399
- Movie?
- No.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.999
Coffee?

07:29.600 --> 07:32.637
Julie, I really appreciate your desire
to be such good friends...

07:32.800 --> 07:36.270
...but the thing about good friends
is that when they want something...

07:36.440 --> 07:37.953
...they just ask.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.594
The interior design job.
I know it's available. I want it.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.351
I thought you wanted me
to water your plants or babysit Kaitlin.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.830
Because you don't take me seriously
as a working woman, as a designer.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.230
You're not really experienced, qualified.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.231
Before I had Marissa,
I did lots of design work.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.709
You had Marissa when you were 18.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.520
I know your usual home designer
fell out at the last minute.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.272
I know you have no one.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.112
Caleb. Pillow talk.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.590
- He thought the idea was inspired.
- Well, it's thinking outside the box.

08:08.760 --> 08:12.070
He told me he's staying out of it, though.
That it's up to you.

08:12.240 --> 08:16.870
Look. One house, one shot. If I screw up,
you can fire me yourself. It's a win-win.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.157
Hi.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.517
- What's so funny?
- Danny. He's, like, the funniest guy ever.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.752
Yeah? Hey, man. I'm Seth.
Good to meet you.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.116
Your yellowtail is not as fresh as mine.
Dare to taste my albacore?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.476
He's, like, straight out
of a Bruce Lee movie.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.478
Hey, who took the jelly
out of your doughnut?

08:50.640 --> 08:52.995
Somebody call <i>CSI</i>,
we got ourselves a cold one here.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.794
- <i>CSI</i>!
- Hey, tag that toe.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.038
All right, well, somebody call <i>ER</i>.
I think Luke's gonna bust a gut.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.954
- I don't get it.
- Hey. Looks like we both got tuna.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.277
Mine's just raw and missing cheese.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.109
Time for class.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.078
Hey, don't fall in.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.714
Hey.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.634
Is this seat available?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.753
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wow.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.559
- I'm so behind already.
- I know the feeling.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.235
Does junior year ever get easier?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.634
I thought you were a senior.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.198
Not a good one. And Harbor,
being as competitive as it is...

10:03.360 --> 10:05.476
...not all my credits transferred.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.513
- But you still wanted to come here?
- Wasn't up to me.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.275
My parents insisted.
Put the paperwork in a while ago.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.353
Why transfer at all,
a little over a semester from graduating?

10:16.800 --> 10:19.633
It just wasn't working for me at Pacific.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.599
Because?

10:21.800 --> 10:26.430
Because there was an incident.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.033
What kind of incident?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.311
Look, I've made some mistakes in my life.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.835
I don't think that's a surprise.
Or a secret.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.390
But if you could just
give me a chance, Ryan.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.393
Just let me in,
like I know people let you in.

10:47.080 --> 10:51.153
I could finally start over.
That's really all I want.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.518
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.874
Hey.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.395
I thought maybe we could
go to Oliver's after school.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.199
- Order in some room service.
- Yeah. You wanna come?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.954
- I was gonna help him with his French.
- French?

11:06.440 --> 11:09.955
- Didn't you live in Paris a couple years?
- A year. When I was 13.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.678
And you need Marissa to help you?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.632
Well, sweet-talking my way
into a club...

11:13.800 --> 11:16.792
...isn't the same
as conjugating the infinitive.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.796
Right. You guys go ahead.
I told Seth I'd meet him back home.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.515
- You sure you don't wanna come?
- Yeah. I trust you.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.918
You should.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.359
- I don't trust him.
- Trust who?

11:53.600 --> 11:56.160
Summer's new boyfriend or whatever.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.118
- Something sort of seems off about him.
- Off how?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.748
I don't know. He's just not funny.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.832
You know what I'm talking about.
He's big.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.833
But big isn't necessarily funny. It's cheap.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.872
He said there was an incident.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.237
- Big funny guy did?
- No. Oliver.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.520
Can we forget Oliver for five seconds
and talk about me?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.830
It's the reason he left Pacific.
What if he's violent?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.433
New guy shows up. Violent. Angry.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.192
Prone to punching people.
That'd be weird.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.669
He needs help with his French?
He lived in France.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.832
We should call the cops.
Oliver lost his grasp on the subjunctive.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.638
Fajitas are served.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.675
Nothing adds up.
And if I try to say anything to Marissa...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.556
- Maybe there's somebody I can talk to.
- Yeah.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.474
Or you could break into the file room and
steal his bio. Or you can be a grownup...

12:40.640 --> 12:44.394
...forget about it and move on. Okay?
Like I am. To the fajitas.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.951
Hey, can I help you?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.397
I forgot a book in my locker.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.190
All right. It's open. Make it quick.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.118
Hey, what are you doing?

14:15.200 --> 14:18.431
I don't think I need to explain
what a serious offense this is.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.751
We understand, and believe me
when I tell you, Ryan will be punished.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.239
I'm afraid it won't end there.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.039
This matter will be presented
to the disciplinary committee.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.272
Suspension, even expulsion,
are not out of the question.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.510
The school must do
what it deems appropriate.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.240
But understand that this
is very uncharacteristic of Ryan.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.996
Indeed. Mr. Atwood and Harbor
seem like a remarkably good fit.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.470
Which leads me to wonder,
why would you do this?

14:43.640 --> 14:48.873
I just... I don't trust this kid.
Oliver. He seems suspicious.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.996
- Suddenly he's going here now.
- I assure you...

14:51.160 --> 14:53.879
...Oliver went through the same
screening process as any student.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.395
He has a history of instability.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.913
I was concerned.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.270
- For Marissa.
- Has he made any threats to her?

15:01.440 --> 15:02.873
Anything to warrant your suspicions?

15:03.040 --> 15:05.508
No, but he's been spending
a lot of time with her.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.318
And there's this letter in his file...

15:09.480 --> 15:11.516
- A confidential letter.
- Says they found him...

15:11.680 --> 15:14.956
...in the men's bathroom at Pacific,
having cut his wrists...

15:15.320 --> 15:17.117
...over a girl.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.595
She filed a restraining order.
That's why he left.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.512
- Is this true?
- Two years ago.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.750
Since then he's been institutionalized.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.753
And everyone involved
in Mr. Trask's rehabilitation...

15:27.920 --> 15:30.753
...believed his best chance
was a change in his environment.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.434
And the school was receptive to him
despite his history?

15:33.880 --> 15:37.589
Harbor is known to make exceptions
for students with troubled backgrounds...

15:37.800 --> 15:41.236
...but who show extraordinary promise.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.470
- I'm sorry.
- We are too.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.479
We will see you at 3 p.m.
For detention...

15:47.640 --> 15:51.599
...which you will attend every day
until the committee reaches its verdict.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.998
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.868
Thank you.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.916
- Seth. Hey.
- Hey.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.638
- I have a surprise for you.
- Really?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.872
Two tickets to see Bright Eyes.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.679
We've never seen them before.
I thought it'd be different.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.956
- Bright Eyes, really?
- Yes.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.230
- Summer, you got... Right there.
- Where?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.038
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.111
- Hey, Summer. Hi, Danny.
- Hey. Oh, Seth.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.794
You got a little nasty there.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.359
- Okay.
- No, seriously.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.556
You got a tuna stain or something.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.235
- Well, I'll be sure and get it washed.
- Seth, seriously. All kidding aside...

16:31.400 --> 16:34.676
...you've got something there, and
I think you're gonna wanna clean it up.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.231
- Seth, you do have something there.
- What?

16:42.760 --> 16:46.275
- You got me.
- God, isn't he, like, the funniest guy ever?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.158
- Yes.
- Hey.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.072
You wanna come over later?
I TiVo-ed Leno.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.878
Sure.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.915
God. Who watches Leno?
That explains everything.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.355
- Explains what?
- Why that Danny guy is so not funny.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.351
- He's funny.
- No, he's not funny, okay?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.715
- He's big. Big is not funny.
- Whatever.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.667
- Seth. Friday night. Bright Eyes?
- Anyone can be big. That's my point.

17:07.839 --> 17:10.637
Right? Being obvious,
there's no accomplishment in that.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.037
- What?
- You're jealous.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.873
Of Danny's comedy?
No, sweetie, I'm not.

17:16.040 --> 17:19.635
No, of Danny. If you weren't,
you'd be happy for Summer.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.597
You'd embrace the friend.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.674
I love this place. All it needs
is a little nip and a tuck.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.671
But are we the right doctors for the job?

17:34.840 --> 17:37.832
Hands of a surgeon. Come on, Coop.
Get excited. Get involved.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.116
We'll blow this wall out,
make it all one room.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.510
Big leather booths.
Keep it dark, but not too dark.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.875
You know, just like it was
for Bogie and Bacall.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.873
- You're serious about this, aren't you?
- Yeah. What do you got?

17:48.480 --> 17:51.438
- They used to have great live music here.
- I like it. Cabaret?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.397
- Actually, jazz.
- Jazz works. That's good.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.478
- How about a raw bar?
- Okay.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.437
- As long as it feels timeless.
- It will.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.354
Gary Cooper was a big oyster man.
And a big drinker.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.476
Okay, so no frou-frou drinks.
No umbrellas.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.835
No fruit wedges.
Nothing Gary wouldn't approve of.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.709
- Only one kind of martini.
- Thank you. And only the finest Scotch.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.190
Now, we're gonna have
to have meat loaf on the menu.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.032
My mother makes
the greatest meat loaf.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.236
- I can get the recipe.
- No, my mother makes...

18:16.400 --> 18:18.709
...the greatest meat loaf,
and I have the recipe.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.752
There can be two meat loafs
on the menu.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.558
We'll make restaurant history.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.553
Hello, Lighthouse. Your ship has come in.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.069
Now, you know where you're going
for the slate, yes?

18:29.240 --> 18:32.915
Brenda Antin has the seagrass mats, and
Betsie von Toff is going to do the flowers.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.310
Hydrangeas only, people. Okay.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.232
We have 72 hours
to make this open house.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.311
I want a full progress report
and POs today.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.550
Let's get it done. Go.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.279
Hey. Sorry about your office, Kiki.
I needed a base camp...

18:47.480 --> 18:49.357
...for Operation Model Home.
- Okay, Julie.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.433
I think maybe a little bit
you've lost your mind. This is a disaster.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.068
Kirsten, if you stopped open-heart
surgery halfway through...

18:56.240 --> 18:57.514
...it would look like murder.

18:57.680 --> 19:02.037
You have 72 hours.
I gave you a list of the usual vendors.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.111
See, there's that word, "usual."

19:04.280 --> 19:07.829
What I'm doing is special. It's inspired.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.709
- You're never gonna get done in time.
- Good attitude.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.757
Thanks for putting that out
in the universe.

19:13.920 --> 19:18.391
All you need is a few accent rugs,
a couch, maybe a potted plant.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.393
- We're selling a space.
- Well, I'm selling a lifestyle.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.916
Kirsten, the Newport Group
should be an aspirational brand.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.196
"Aspirational"? Is that even a word?

19:27.360 --> 19:30.909
I know it seems ambitious.
And it'll be expensive, but sometimes...

19:31.080 --> 19:33.469
...you gotta spend money to make money.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.389
Hey, are you hungry? I'm starved.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.357
Why'd you do it? If they vote to expel
you, there's nothing we can do.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.035
You will have taken this opportunity
and tanked it. And why?

20:30.280 --> 20:33.716
- Are you jealous of this Oliver kid?
- No. No, I'm not jealous.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.839
Look, you guys may not believe me.
No one may believe me.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.754
The first time I met the kid, he was in jail.
He has a medical history. You're right.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.798
Okay. He's trouble. Now you're
the one who might be expelled.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.952
- Lf only you had come to us.
- I wanted to deal with it myself.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.792
- Well done.
- Do you know how hard we...?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.633
- You worked to get into that school?
- You can't help Marissa.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.156
- You can't even help yourself.
- Okay. I screwed up, yet again.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.038
So now what?

20:58.680 --> 20:59.874
You gonna kick me out?

21:02.480 --> 21:05.552
You think you can mess up so bad
we'll just give up on you? You can't.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.349
You are part of this family now, and
you're gonna feel the full weight of that.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.909
You're gonna wish we threw you out.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.159
Hey, man.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.152
I couldn't help but overhear.
Actually, I was eavesdropping.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.072
They're pretty pissed, huh?

21:37.240 --> 21:40.118
- Yeah, well, I deserved it.
- Yeah?

21:40.600 --> 21:44.309
Well, good. So this is over then, though?
I mean, lesson learned and all that?

21:51.000 --> 21:54.788
Today I saw Oliver give Marissa a letter...

21:54.960 --> 21:56.791
...which she put in her locker.

22:01.240 --> 22:06.189
And seeing Oliver do this inspired you
to write a letter of your own?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.990
So this is Oliver's letter.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.716
That Marissa asked you to mail?

22:13.480 --> 22:16.040
- I took it from her locker.
- Dude, what is wrong with you?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.713
- You haven't read it?
- No, not yet.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.348
Not ever. You can't read it.
You have to put it back.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.670
What if he's after her? He's a sick kid.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.229
Oliver has not done anything to Marissa
except be her friend.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.795
Okay, stop it.
You're in enough trouble already.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.753
And honestly, you're starting
to freak me out a little bit.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.950
Just... Will you promise me
that you will put it back?

22:37.400 --> 22:39.994
Will you promise me
that you will put it back?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.951
- Put it back.
- I will.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.314
Put it back.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.359
Come in.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.399
Hey, man.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.197
Okay, I know everything you said
last night, but I need to talk to you.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.191
- You read it?
- It's worse than I imagined.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.828
- No, please don't.
- He says he can't live without her...

23:45.000 --> 23:47.230
I don't wanna hear it.
That letter's like <i>The Ring</i>.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.198
Anyone who reads it is gonna die.
Plus, it's a federal offense.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.749
- Okay. I'm being serious.
- So am I. Okay?

23:52.920 --> 23:56.390
That is Marissa's letter
that you stole from her locker and read?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.471
- Lf she finds out, you guys are done.
- Okay.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.596
- I get that. Oliver...
- Oliver might be crazy.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.036
You might be right. But right now,
you're giving him a run for his money.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.479
Hey, Seth. Is Ryan in there?

24:07.920 --> 24:09.433
Yeah. Hey.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.997
Hey. What are you guys doing?

24:14.160 --> 24:16.310
Ryan was waxing my back.
Could you give us a sec?

24:16.520 --> 24:18.909
Sure. I just wanted to know
if after school today...

24:19.080 --> 24:21.548
...you wanted to take
that cooking lesson with Oliver?

24:22.760 --> 24:27.151
I can't. I'm helping Kirsten move furniture
in the new model home.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.594
Julie?

24:45.880 --> 24:47.154
It's a disaster.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.072
What was all that
about open-heart surgery?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.514
I lost the patient.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.557
- What happened?
- It's what didn't happen.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.028
No slate. No bubbling fountains.
No seagrass.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.433
Hydrangeas are out of season.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.478
We have 48 hours until the open house,
and we have nothing.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.312
- We can fix this.
- No, we can't.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.438
Way to put that into the universe.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.270
I'll call my vendors.
It may not be anything special.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.158
It may not be "aspirational."

25:17.320 --> 25:20.437
God, I don't give a rat's ass.
If Caleb sees that house empty...

25:20.600 --> 25:24.195
He won't. But you gotta be ready
to work. Get your hands dirty.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.959
Manicure's not till Friday.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.952
Can I have an orange-peel smoothie
with a splash of pineapple, please?

25:36.120 --> 25:37.872
I'll have the same.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.231
Except with some strawberry and banana.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.036
Mr. Palmer totally looks like a pterodactyl.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.958
God, he does impersonations?

25:53.680 --> 25:56.592
Hey, why you all up in my Kool-Aid
not even knowing the flavor?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.074
- Hey, Summer.
- What?

25:59.240 --> 26:00.832
- You know who wants a smoothie?
- Who?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.276
- Mr. Chuckle!
- No! Oh, my God.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.951
Danny. Hey, what are you
doing after school?

26:10.120 --> 26:12.350
You wanna maybe come over
and hang out at my house?

26:12.520 --> 26:14.909
I've TiVo-ed some Leno.
Seann William Scott's on.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.356
Oh, Leno. Sean William Scott. Nice.
Double the comedy.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.873
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.992
Hey, man. I thought you were in court.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.720
No, it's a settlement.
I almost never go to court anymore.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.759
So order up some martinis and meat loaf.
We got ourselves a restaurant.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.160
Well, I thought you'd be
a little more excited.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.231
- What'd you do?
- I put a down payment on it.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.833
Tomorrow we go sign the title.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.719
I haven't had a chance to come up
with my share of the money.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.917
No, I covered it. We can work out
a get-even scheme once we're afloat.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.117
- So, what? I work for you?
- Jimmy, come on.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.635
You were one click away
from manning the mechanical bull...

26:54.800 --> 26:55.835
...at the new cowboy bar.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.151
I wanna pull my own weight. You've
already done enough for me as it is.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.753
I'm not doing it just for you.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.230
This could mean freedom for both of us.
You could stay at a job you like...

27:04.400 --> 27:08.029
...and it'd give me a break from all
my rich clients and the office politics.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.668
- We could work for ourselves.
- I don't know, Sandy.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.638
- I think I need more time to...
- How much more time do you need?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.432
It's too fast. It's too soon.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.757
Okay. Great. Great. I got an idea.
Let's wait till we're dead.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.232
I gotta go settle.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.317
That is so cool
that you know Marissa's combo.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.799
Shows a lot of trust.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.273
- Yeah, for emergencies.
- Oh, yeah?

27:50.440 --> 27:55.309
What's the emergency? Ran out
of erasers? No more ink left in your pen?

27:55.480 --> 27:57.994
No, it's a book I forgot.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.628
Just kidding around, man.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.589
Last class of the day
is so tough to get through.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.478
- Feel you on that one.
- What's up?

28:06.840 --> 28:09.400
Hey, Marissa and I were
talking about a camping trip.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.710
Santa Monica mountains?
Bring the whole gang?

28:12.600 --> 28:14.113
- Sure. Yeah.
- Sounds awesome, man.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.430
All right. I'll let her know that you are in.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.879
Long bathroom break.
I should go. See you.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.118
I do not like that kid at all.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.272
Yeah? Don't you think that...?

28:30.520 --> 28:32.829
He's here for Marissa. Hell, yeah.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.039
You gotta let that guy know, "back off."

28:36.400 --> 28:37.799
I'll do it for you, if you want.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.758
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Just give me the word...

28:40.920 --> 28:43.673
...and I will drop the Great Gatsby.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.678
Did your mama teach you
how to play this game?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.070
You didn't think I'd pack the heat,
did you?

28:55.240 --> 28:58.516
Think you can just get me here, huh?
Home court advantage. Guess what.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.353
Who's got the secret codes? Danny does.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.997
Guess what, buddy. You are <i>Punk'd</i>.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.958
There's a camera there, camera there
and a camera right there.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.269
- Who's your daddy?
- Hey, kid.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.954
Settlement happened sooner
than I thought.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.430
- Good. This is my friend Danny.
- Hey. How are you? I'm Sandy.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.279
Why don't you take a shower?

29:18.360 --> 29:21.875
- Pardon me?
- Just kidding. I like you dirty.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.632
Sandy. Dirty. Sandy. Dirty.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.991
- That kid is not funny.
- Thank you. I know.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.749
- He makes Ryan look funny.
- He makes Marissa look funny.

29:34.920 --> 29:40.438
Gentiles. I love your mother
more than words, but not funny.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.989
Get yourself some funnier friends.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.393
- There you are.
- Thanks, man.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.711
- Sure.
- I'm so parched.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.996
Oh, dude. Have you seen
my impression of Mr. Parker?

29:59.160 --> 30:01.310
Yes. Pterodactyl. Seen it. It's good.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.117
- Hey, listen, man. Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.840
Whenever you're around Summer,
could you...?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.675
This is weird, but could you try
and be a little less funny?

30:13.840 --> 30:16.752
Man, all I ever hear from her
is how funny Seth Cohen is.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.480
How he's the funniest guy
she's ever met.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.838
I mean, I like her so much, and I'm just...
I'm killing myself to hang in there.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.076
She said that about me,
that she thinks I'm the funniest guy ever?

30:29.240 --> 30:32.198
Yes. You and some dude
named Captain Oats.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.033
Who the hell is Captain Oats?

30:36.720 --> 30:39.473
Well, chin up, Danny.
Because you know what?

30:39.800 --> 30:43.793
I think you're funny. I just think,
and if you don't mind me saying so...

30:43.960 --> 30:47.999
...that you could go a little bigger
with your comedy. I think you're small...

30:48.160 --> 30:49.912
...a little under the radar.
- Yeah?

30:50.080 --> 30:51.877
- Yeah, big's hilarious.
- Big.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.837
- Yeah.
- All right, man. Thanks.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.718
- I'll give that a shot.
- Give it a shot.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.552
I'll give it a shot!

30:57.800 --> 31:00.268
Thanks for making time for me
after school.

31:00.440 --> 31:04.228
- I know how busy you are.
- Of course. What's going on?

31:04.440 --> 31:06.476
Why don't you have a seat.

31:10.120 --> 31:15.069
So I know this is a little outside
my job description as dean.

31:15.320 --> 31:19.472
I felt I had a responsibility
to have an honest conversation with you.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.831
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you about...

31:22.000 --> 31:25.231
...one of our transfer students, with
whom I know you have a relationship.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.552
- And who I worry might not be so stable.
- I appreciate it, Dr. Kim.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.075
But I'm well aware of Oliver's issues.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.356
It's not Oliver I want to talk about.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.197
Detention's over, gentlemen.
See you tomorrow.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.236
I thought you were helping Kirsten.

32:10.920 --> 32:15.152
- I got detention.
- I see that. What for?

32:16.480 --> 32:19.233
I failed this chemistry quiz,
slacking off on some homework.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.834
That's a lie.

32:22.560 --> 32:26.758
- What are you talking about?
- I heard what happened, your break-in.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.235
- I did it to protect you.
- What? What are you talking about?

32:32.400 --> 32:35.233
I don't trust him. He has a history
of girls he's obsessed with.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.719
He's not obsessed with me.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.913
You know, ever since he showed up,
you never trusted him.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.196
And okay, that's who you are...

32:42.360 --> 32:44.920
...but you have to trust me.
- The kid has serious issues.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.514
- Who doesn't?
- He's in love with you.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.074
We're just friends.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.114
Yeah.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.917
Then what's this?

32:58.360 --> 32:59.793
Where did you get this?

33:02.960 --> 33:04.678
You stole it from my locker?

33:06.760 --> 33:08.591
I've been looking everywhere for this.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.519
So you know what this is?
What this says?

33:10.680 --> 33:11.874
I can't believe you.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.435
I can't believe you stole it. You read it.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.591
How can you say
he's not in love with you?

33:16.760 --> 33:19.957
Because he didn't write it to me.
He wrote it to Natalie.

33:20.120 --> 33:24.272
He wants to get back together with her.
And he just wanted me to read it first.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.952
- Look, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.438
Because now...

33:40.120 --> 33:42.236
...I don't trust you.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.434
- Morning.
- Morning.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.554
You okay?

34:01.720 --> 34:04.518
Well, I'm supposed to sign
the title on the Lighthouse today.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.511
I can't believe
you're buying a restaurant.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.717
Funny. That's what Jimmy said
just before he backed out.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.438
He did?

34:12.120 --> 34:16.476
I know the whole idea seems crazy,
but I thought that was part of the appeal.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.355
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have to buy a little time...

34:20.520 --> 34:21.714
...and not lose the place.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.714
Well, you can always hire Julie
as a partner. I think she'll be available.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.348
I have to show my father
the model home this morning...

34:28.520 --> 34:30.750
...and we had no time to pull it together.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.275
- I believe he will be underwhelmed.
- The Coopers keep things unpredictable.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.590
No. I predicted that Julie would be fired.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.591
Top of the morning to you, son.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.315
- You talk to Ryan last night?
- No, he just came home and went to bed.

34:44.199 --> 34:48.273
Hey. Do you want something to eat?
You missed dinner, you must be hungry.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.873
- I'm okay. Thanks.
- What time's Marissa picking you up?

34:51.040 --> 34:54.157
- I was gonna maybe go early with Anna.
- Marissa's not picking me up.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.678
He hasn't called yet.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.629
- I know.
- Is it bad that he hasn't called yet?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.870
It doesn't mean anything.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.317
Here you go, Mr. Nichol.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.434
- Hello.
- Hi, Cal.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.919
Hey, Dad.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.877
I just got back
from the new development.

35:21.080 --> 35:25.153
Look, it was short notice and
Julie did the best she could, considering.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.838
You're preaching to the converted.
I loved it.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.150
The d Ácor was simple, classic.
The way I like it.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.120
It allows the architecture and views
to sell themselves.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.588
- You're happy?
- You're happy?

35:35.760 --> 35:39.753
Pleased as punch. How Julie here
hit one out of the park on her first swing.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.840
What can I say? It's my true passion.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.238
Well, now your passion's your job.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.233
Kiki, stop looking for a new decorator.
We've found our girl.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.549
- We have?
- We have?

35:51.720 --> 35:54.757
The fact that you two are such close
friends makes the decision easier.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.276
Be fun. You two working together,
side by side.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.229
Have you lost your mind, Kiki?
That thing is unsightly.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.828
Well, who could have predicted this?

36:11.400 --> 36:14.312
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Cohen.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.674
How are you?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.910
- Okay.
- Yeah?

36:18.560 --> 36:22.235
It's just Danny.
I mean, he was, like, really funny, right?

36:22.840 --> 36:25.798
- Yeah.
- And now, all of a sudden, he's gotten...

36:26.600 --> 36:27.828
...big.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.912
Hey, Seth. Check it out!

36:31.360 --> 36:33.237
Get off me!

36:34.720 --> 36:37.757
- Now, that's funny.
- Yeah.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.473
Well, that's the end of him.

36:39.880 --> 36:43.839
I guess I really will end up
bitter and alone.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.793
Hey.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.791
I'm sorry.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.590
And I thought he was a good one.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.877
But I guess people can be
really unpredictable.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.634
You know?

36:59.480 --> 37:02.597
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.751
- Nice scarf.
- You too.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.433
- So it's <i>croque-monsieur</i> Thursday.
- Yes, it is.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.717
- I was thinking fish sticks.
- I was gonna have peanut butter and jelly.

37:11.880 --> 37:15.395
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna just go wash up.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.754
- We'll go eat?
- Okay.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.388
All right. Bye.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.792
- Well, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, well.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.759
I have to go ice Big Funny Guy, so...

37:31.240 --> 37:33.037
Well, if you're ever feeling, you know...

37:33.240 --> 37:35.913
...too bitter and Ionely,
I TiVo-ed some <i>Daily Show</i> s.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.674
I know Jon Stewart's no Leno.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.079
Thanks.

38:24.920 --> 38:28.196
My dad died and left me this place.
I never thought I'd have to sell it.

38:28.360 --> 38:31.272
It was such a magical spot,
when I was a kid.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.954
Don't sell it. Just give me
more time to find a partner.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.317
Sandy, I got two other offers
on the table. I can't wait any longer.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.993
I understand.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.357
I'm not too late, am I?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.158
Who's this?

38:43.320 --> 38:45.117
My partner.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.393
I found him.

38:47.560 --> 38:51.189
That conversation we just had about not
wanting to buy the place? Forget it.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.638
Look, you know, this could fail.
I mean, you know...

38:55.800 --> 38:58.917
...I could fail again. I pretty much
only have a legacy of failure.

38:59.080 --> 39:02.152
I could be responsible for ruining
this place, ruining our friendship.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.992
Jimmy. Just sign it.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.513
Okay.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.309
I heard what happened
between you and Marissa.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.953
Yeah.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.598
I'm sorry.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.274
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.717
I was wrong about you.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.870
Well, I mean, did you think I came here
because of Marissa?

39:44.440 --> 39:46.954
What, because I'm in love with her?

39:47.120 --> 39:48.997
Yeah. No. I...

39:50.440 --> 39:51.998
It was crazy.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.714
Here's the deal, Ryan.
And it's nothing personal.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.798
But Marissa and I, we just connect.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.991
She understands me, gets me.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.549
I don't know if there's only one person
on the planet...

40:12.720 --> 40:14.153
...you're supposed to be with...

40:14.320 --> 40:17.790
...but when she and I are together,
sure feels that way.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.597
I'm sorry, but you and Marissa?
Come on, man.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.194
- You're from different worlds.
- You stay away from her.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.749
You can't fight fate, man.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.156
I didn't even have to lift a finger,
and look what happened to you guys.

40:32.320 --> 40:35.118
Because you're not supposed
to be together.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.595
I'm not saying
you didn't serve your purpose.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.638
If it wasn't for you,
she would've never gone to therapy.

40:40.880 --> 40:44.395
- She never would've met me.
- I am not gonna let this happen.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.393
At this point, who's gonna believe you?

40:48.320 --> 40:49.639
Walk away...

40:49.800 --> 40:52.030
...you have a chance
to make something of yourself.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.869
Don't blow it over some chick
you're not gonna care about in 10 years.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.674
Okay?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.119
I really am sorry.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.876
Hey! Hey! Back off!

41:12.800 --> 41:14.518
Get off me!

41:14.920 --> 41:16.114
Get off me!

41:16.840 --> 41:18.990
Stay away from her! Stay away from her!

41:19.305 --> 41:25.489
