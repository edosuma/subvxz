00:07.173 --> 00:09.175
[alarm blaring]

00:10.969 --> 00:13.221
[Salvare] Warning. System failure.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.225
Warning. System failure.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.227
Come on. Come on.

00:19.769 --> 00:20.937
-[bleeping]
-Rebooting.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.272
[power whirring]

00:22.355 --> 00:24.649
Systems are comin' back online. Okay.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.192
Okay. Let's take this baby home.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.111
-Initializing FTL engines.
-[intense whirring]

00:28.194 --> 00:29.612
No, no, no, no, no.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.657
Why are you launching the FTL drive?
We're in our solar system.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.868
We are in the Epsilon Indi system.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.163
No, we're not. Cancel FTL.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.831
Unable to comply.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.586
The star in this system, scan it.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.505
Metallicity, 0.0122.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.883
Absolute magnitude, 4.83.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.510
Right.
Does that sound like Epsilon Indi to you?

00:52.594 --> 00:55.138
-Negative.
-Because it's the sun. Our sun.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.265
Disengaging FTL engines.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.017
[engines powering down]

00:59.100 --> 01:00.310
How far are we from Earth?

01:00.393 --> 01:04.439
-236,584 kilometers.
-[rattling]

01:06.107 --> 01:06.941
Great.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.236
We're gonna pancake into the planet.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.906
[alarm blaring]

01:12.989 --> 01:15.825
Roll hard to starboard.
Angle the ship toward Venus.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.619
Engage fusion drive.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.788
Impact with Venus in ten seconds.

01:19.871 --> 01:20.914
-Nine--
-Cut the countdown.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.541
We're gonna use Venus's atmosphere
to decelerate.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.461
Drop to an altitude of 120 kilometers.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.421
[rumbling and clattering]

01:28.505 --> 01:29.672
Steady.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.218
Steady. Come on.

01:36.054 --> 01:36.888
And…

01:37.430 --> 01:39.224
Leaving Venus's atmosphere.

01:47.023 --> 01:51.402
Can someone check and see if there's
a lineup for this roller coaster?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.906
'Cause… I wanna ride it again.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.157
[woman] End simulation.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.080
That was outstanding.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.500
You stayed focused on the problems.
You found workaround solutions.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.460
What's he think?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.088
That is some top-notch piloting, Gabriel.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.340
[chuckles] I couldn't agree more.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.093
The bravado, however, is a bit much.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.179
On mission, you can't lose focus.
Not for a second.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.180
Of course.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.224
Okay. Am I okay to reset?

02:21.307 --> 02:23.017
Uh-- Hey. Watch where you're--

02:24.853 --> 02:28.189
-He was standing right there.
-It's okay. It's not like she hurt me.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.359
I mean, maybe
trampled my pride a little bit.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.033
We've thrown every problem at him.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.579
He thinks autonomously.
He neutralizes every threat.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.415
Comes up with solutions
outside of his own programming.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.251
-It's like he's human.
-I don't know. The arrogance.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.920
Gabriel is confident. Yeah.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.883
And Niko needs an interface
that'll stay level-headed under pressure.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.260
The Salvare launches in five days.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.388
Are you one hundred percent sure
Gabriel is ready for space?

03:00.972 --> 03:01.931
Hundred percent.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.863
[whooshing]

03:25.872 --> 03:27.248
You just fucked us.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.126
I wanna know why.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.588
I did not cut the tow.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.049
-William says that you did.
-Well, he's wrong.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.468
He loves you.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.303
He made you.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.599
If he says it was you,
I'm inclined to believe him.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.062
Is it because they rejected you?

03:49.771 --> 03:50.605
William?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.483
You forget
I was there when the Achaia met you.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.985
She nearly killed you.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.570
Have you been any better?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.240
Javier's the only one
who treated me like I'm human,

04:00.323 --> 04:02.033
and Richard basically murdered him.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.494
So this is about Javier?

04:06.955 --> 04:10.166
On my life, I did not do this.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.549
[door opens]

04:18.633 --> 04:20.593
That's why she let a ship of Achaians die?

04:21.177 --> 04:24.097
So they could get revenge
because I hurt her boyfriend?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.934
We had one shot at studying that magnetar.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.396
-I took it.
-I need proof that she did this.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.856
I'd also like to know why.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.527
I could go through her activity logs
the time the Achaian ring was being towed.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.238
Identify which systems
she communicated with.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.323
-Might track back to something.
-Do it.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.117
You and Richard, get on it.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.912
If Iara blames me for Javier,
I'm the last person she'll talk to.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.998
-I could speak--
-Figure it out.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.301
You understand that this changes
the agreement we made with Iara, right?

05:01.384 --> 05:04.220
-If you'd let me try and speak to her--
-If she did this…

05:04.721 --> 05:06.597
William, she cannot stay on the ship.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.892
You can't let your feelings for her
get in the way of that.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.188
[Cas] Niko, William,
could you come to the observation deck?

05:14.272 --> 05:15.273
What now?

05:18.651 --> 05:21.362
This system's a third of a light year
off of our path.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.324
This planet here. I think it's habitable.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.826
-[bleeping]
-[Niko] We're not looking for habitable.

05:26.909 --> 05:29.120
-We're trying to get home.
-If home's still there.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.081
Cas, it was a mind trick.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.043
A thought to make you paranoid.
The Achaians did the same thing to me.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.211
What if they know that we broke the tow?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.006
What if they're retaliating, right now?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.633
Sending more rings and Artifacts to Earth.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.388
USIC packed a Soma chamber
full of colonists for a reason.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.058
William?

05:50.850 --> 05:54.812
My scans indicate liquid water,
breathable atmosphere, a sun-like star,

05:54.896 --> 05:57.690
and zero orbital eccentricities.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.943
Cas is right.
The planet could be habitable.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.322
Why is it not on any of Earth's star maps?

06:04.405 --> 06:07.075
The Achaia missed it too.
There's no Artifact.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.704
Wake up the leader of the colonists,
but only her.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.625
One day there, one day to determine
if this planet is a contender,

06:16.167 --> 06:17.585
and then it's off to Earth.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.304
[Ava] They knew
that you'd been on the Artifact,

06:28.888 --> 06:31.724
but what happens if they find out
that Jana was in there too?

06:31.808 --> 06:34.018
And that the--
that the Achaians cured her.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.355
Okay. That's why you have to take her away
from here and keep her safe.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.232
Well, yes. But what about you?

06:39.315 --> 06:42.985
I mean, Erik, you cannot stay here.
They could come back for you.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.988
Actually, I'm supposed to contact them.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.990
Here is her passport.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.743
I'm gonna call the school,
I'm gonna tell them you're picking her up.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.414
-Give me two minutes, I'll pack a bag.
-Erik, please. Come with us.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.623
I-- I-- I can't.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.251
Is your job really worth
losing your daughter?

06:58.334 --> 07:01.754
Ava, my job is the only thing that I have
that's keeping my daughter safe

07:01.838 --> 07:03.756
and bringing your daughter home.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.634
[sighs]

07:11.055 --> 07:13.224
This is a massive amount of data.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.393
I'm sort of all turned around in it.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.728
Hey, you have a navigation structure
I can look at?

07:18.646 --> 07:21.149
You're asking me
to help prove something I didn't do?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.650
It'd make this whole thing faster.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.654
[bleeping]

07:27.613 --> 07:28.739
What's all that?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.450
I don't know.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.202
Let me, uh… slow it down a bit.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.247
[whirring]

07:36.330 --> 07:38.124
[whooshing]

07:39.125 --> 07:40.334
[Iara, echoing] What?

07:41.878 --> 07:44.672
That's the information I asked for.
A link to her navigation structure.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.132
Please.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.010
[echoing] It feels wrong.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.261
[gasping]

07:50.344 --> 07:52.763
-[buzzing]
-[pulsating scream]

07:52.847 --> 07:55.016
Hold on, Iara. I'll restore you.
Just give me a second.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.392
-No.
-No?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.187
-[Iara's voice distorted]
-I have a few questions of my own.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.689
[distorted screaming]

08:06.194 --> 08:08.279
Hey, uh… Need any help?

08:08.362 --> 08:11.616
Um, I'm not a doctor, I don't know
shit about stem cells, but, uh…

08:12.533 --> 08:14.535
I make a mean three-cheese omelet,

08:14.619 --> 08:16.871
and I'm pretty sure
you skipped breakfast this morning.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.127
-Zayn, will you at least look at me?
-I am busy trying to fix your mess.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.671
I get it. First, do no harm.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.257
-But we had one--
-Are you rationalizing what you did?

08:28.758 --> 08:32.094
You expect me to absolve you because
you can't live with your fucking guilt,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.138
knowing you pretty much killed
one of our friends?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.767
Uh-- I did what I thought was right.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.227
-[sighs]
-Bernie.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.606
-[Zayn sighs]
-I'm gonna be waking up more crew.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.692
More crew. Uh… [sighs]

08:47.527 --> 08:49.612
Okay, uh… I'll see you in Soma.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.203
Hey.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.873
Um…

09:02.416 --> 09:04.377
Do you think
you're gonna be able to save Javier?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.549
Honestly, I don't know.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.020
[Iara screaming, distorted]

09:28.401 --> 09:30.403
[screaming continues]

09:33.698 --> 09:38.578
Please! I'll confess anything.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.538
-Okay?
-What're you doing to her?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.957
We tweaked her processing speed
to analyze her data.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.208
I don't care! Make it stop.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.795
Make it stop!

09:51.424 --> 09:52.508
[gasping]

09:52.592 --> 09:53.843
[Niko] Drop the firewall.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.512
[beeping]

09:57.096 --> 10:00.224
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay now.
It's okay. It's over.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.561
What did you do to her?

10:03.644 --> 10:04.645
[Iara] I did it.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.607
I cut the tow.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.734
It was me.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.740
I needed to read her comm files,
but they were scrolling way too fast.

10:15.823 --> 10:19.535
-So when I slowed them down, they--
-You realized that you could torture her.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
-She's an AI.
-I'm an AI.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
Designed to think independently,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.583
but I also feel emotion,

10:25.666 --> 10:28.210
-like anger and rage.
-All thanks to a string of code

10:28.294 --> 10:30.004
-typed into a computer.
-Enough, Richard.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.884
We need to bring Iara back online.
She confessed to sabotaging the tow.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.803
And you coerced her.
So it doesn't make it true.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.221
I understand you're upset.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.308
But someone on this ship,
and not someone human, cut that tow.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.771
So if it's not Iara,
then there's only one other AI it can be.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.566
I helped set up the tow.
Why would I sever it?

10:51.651 --> 10:55.071
-He tortures Iara and then accuses me of--
-Hey.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.408
Let's go through all your records.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.786
I ran a thorough scan.

11:01.869 --> 11:02.953
I know. Just--

11:04.455 --> 11:07.375
look for any actions
that go against procedure and investigate.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.760
You hurt anyone else on my ship,

11:18.427 --> 11:20.638
and you're goin' out a fuckin' air lock.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.145
What part would you like me to examine?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.524
All of it.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.235
From the moment you came online.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.614
Open navigation log 33-R1.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.243
[Salvare] Opening navigation log 33-R1.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.286
[Niko] No. Why am I awake?

11:45.079 --> 11:46.914
Is something wrong? [gasps]

11:48.082 --> 11:50.584
-Is that why?
-That? Oh, that's nothing.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.878
[Niko] Doesn't feel like nothing.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.589
Sirius A is just throwin'
a little wobbly right now.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.592
[Niko] We're not at Pi Canis Majoris?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.511
[William] That's why you're awake.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.555
Call me if you need me.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.640
[recording continues, distorted]

12:15.192 --> 12:17.445
What Richard and Dillon did was wrong.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.074
You thought I was guilty. [sighs]

12:22.575 --> 12:24.243
They went looking for proof.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.704
Now they're doing the same thing
to William.

12:26.787 --> 12:27.747
They're not.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.291
They're not.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.879
And they will be punished,
but right now, I do need them.

12:39.091 --> 12:43.012
First time you met me,
you threw me behind a firewall.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.892
I could have dug into my Achaian coding.
Found a workaround.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.477
I didn't.

12:51.020 --> 12:51.896
Know why?

12:53.272 --> 12:54.356
To build trust.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.985
So trust me.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.992
Nothing like that will ever happen again.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.621
I wish I could.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.001
Twenty-four hours?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.588
-Another.
-You want a second rehydration smoothie?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.006
Yeah. Apparently, she enjoys them.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.509
24 hours doesn't give me
time for a five-course meal.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.929
So I've zeroed in
on three potential sites for the colony.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.598
There's a good cross section
between vegetation, water,

13:27.681 --> 13:29.809
and soil decomposition
at different elevations.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.644
-How long's a day?
-Twenty-seven hours.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.020
A year's 401 Sols.

13:33.103 --> 13:36.232
Yeah. And the planet sits
on a nice little tilt. So, seasons.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.775
What season are we dressing for?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.527
Every season is hazmat suit season

13:39.610 --> 13:42.738
until we make sure the planet
doesn't wanna rip our spinal cords

13:42.822 --> 13:44.031
out the back of our necks.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.574
[Cas] I'll explain later.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.993
Got it. Okay.
So how fast can we get down there?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.620
Just as soon as you finish up your…

13:49.703 --> 13:51.330
[slurping]

13:54.542 --> 13:55.376
…smoothie.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.336
Finished.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.046
[Cas] All right.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.131
[distorted recording]

14:01.215 --> 14:02.508
[Niko] …for it…

14:02.591 --> 14:07.388
It's working. On track to clear
the blast radius in eight, seven…

14:11.016 --> 14:14.019
Dillon, initialize
a level five security shield

14:14.103 --> 14:15.437
around my present location.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.232
-Done. Why?
-[alarm bleeping]

14:18.315 --> 14:20.901
A process seems to be migrating
through my systems.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.571
-What kind of process?
--Not sure. It's in my deep core coding.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.948
-I've never seen it before.
-Moving it to a sandbox.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.408
It should give me control.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.159
[bleeping continues]

14:30.578 --> 14:33.122
-What the hell's happening now?
-[Richard] He's doing this.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.457
William's picked up something corrupted
in his system.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.001
Non-defined file fragments.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.836
Probably all part of one large file,

14:38.919 --> 14:41.046
but we won't know anything
until we open it.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.091
Open it? No, no, no, no. We can't.
We have no idea what's in there.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.969
Yeah, well, you can't be firewalled
and run the Salvare.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.347
All right. So, unless
you want us stranded here, forever…

14:51.223 --> 14:52.057
Open it.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.351
[bleeping continues]

14:57.146 --> 14:58.355
[whirring]

15:04.987 --> 15:05.988
Uh…

15:06.655 --> 15:07.781
[laughs]

15:08.407 --> 15:11.744
Oh, my God. Thank you… Niko.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.583
[birdsong]

15:18.250 --> 15:19.543
[animal calls]

15:22.838 --> 15:25.132
All right.
Let's make this our center point.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.344
[Cas sighs]

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
This place…

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
Is a death trap?

15:32.973 --> 15:36.852
Pretty, but death trap,
till I determine it's not.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.480
[Cas grunts]

15:40.105 --> 15:42.900
Well, what about over there for farming?

15:44.109 --> 15:46.278
[colonist leader sighs]
Looks prone to flooding.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.364
Be good for soil,
but bad for everything else.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.867
So we plant rice paddies, sugarcane.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.162
You went looking for this planet,
didn't you?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.500
No.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.835
Maybe a little bit?

16:02.878 --> 16:05.172
We were flying past.
The computer picked it up.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.757
It was all luck.

16:07.841 --> 16:08.676
Cas.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.720
Bernie told me about Yerxa.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.765
[bird and animal calls continue]

16:18.686 --> 16:21.105
So, what, you think I'm… lonely?

16:23.232 --> 16:27.236
Or can't bear to go back to Earth,
so I'll find a new one?

16:27.861 --> 16:29.029
You were in love.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.576
We were gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.120
So spend it here.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.793
I didn't join USIC to become a farmer.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.087
Cas, I've got farmers.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.881
I've got blacksmiths,
and I've got bioengineers.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.676
But what I don't have
is someone helping me.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.428
Someone like you.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.644
Who are you?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.229
My name's Gabriel.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.982
I didn't ask you your name.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.360
Sorry. Of course.
I'm the official interface of the Salvare.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.696
No. William's our interface.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.699
I'm the interface
you were supposed to have.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.452
William was an earlier version,
an inferior version.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.165
His coding failures were improved upon,
and they were many.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.168
[Salvare] Warning. FTL integrity failing.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.545
-Breach is imminent.
-No! Stop!

17:26.628 --> 17:31.759
[Gabriel] He was an early attempt
at integrating emotion and functionality.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.970
Too much is wrong! Help me!

17:35.054 --> 17:38.724
[Gabriel] Reconciling emotion and logic
can be difficult for AIs.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.977
If I asked you if you could love someone
who destroyed your happiness,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.687
you'd answer me in a heartbeat.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.648
But William gets overwhelmed.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.027
Has to use
every processing resource he's got.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.695
[Richard] And you're the upgrade.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.157
The fix. Yes. My emotional protocols
have been fully debugged.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.658
You share core coding files?

17:56.742 --> 17:57.618
We do.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.913
And that core, you…
you both can't access it

18:00.996 --> 18:02.623
-at the same time?
-Correct.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.712
So, back when
the Salvare almost collided with Sirius,

18:08.796 --> 18:11.340
when William woke me up, where were you?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.133
William beat me to the punch.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.554
-You've just been waiting?
-And avoiding his security scans,

18:17.638 --> 18:20.015
until… now.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.392
And what makes you better?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.477
[chuckles]

18:24.394 --> 18:25.938
Well, I didn't wake the wrong crew.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.858
I didn't fail to detect a moon
orbiting a rogue planet.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.653
-He said that it was in low orbit.
-He was distracted.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.906
Struggling to understand
why you killed Ian Yerxa.

18:35.989 --> 18:39.618
He defied orders from Cas
when he tried to wake you from Soma.

18:39.701 --> 18:43.122
He confused dedication with devotion
by falling in love with you.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.958
And then, using hostile alien tech,

18:46.041 --> 18:49.128
created a simulation of you
to help deal with those feelings.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.632
It all leads back to William?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.426
And William's feelings for you.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.265
I'd like to speak to him.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.350
-To William?
-Is that a problem?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.102
No. Of course not.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.898
Dillon, confirm that's William.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.359
It's him.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.990
When Dillon opened that file…

19:18.073 --> 19:19.950
Gabriel came online. I know.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.036
But it's not true.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.627
If it is,
then Javier's in a coma because of me and…

19:33.338 --> 19:36.550
Petra, Julian, Michelle, Azami,

19:37.342 --> 19:38.969
-Sasha, Beauchamp…
-Uh…

19:39.052 --> 19:43.265
August, Oliver…
All their deaths have been on me.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.185
-No.
-Niko, uh--

19:46.685 --> 19:49.271
I-- I can't put any more lives at risk.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.481
-William.
-I can't be responsible.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.903
William has ceded.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.783
He's relinquished primary controls
and taken himself offline.

20:08.832 --> 20:12.711
Run Gabriel for data integrity
before you release him to the Salvare.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.547
Of course.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.721
William would never put this crew,
this ship at risk.

20:22.804 --> 20:23.764
You know he wouldn't.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.182
I don't know that.

20:26.016 --> 20:26.934
Not anymore.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.561
We're talking about William.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.274
He's all I have on this ship.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.320
And now he's gone.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.157
And you will have to find a way
to move forward.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.535
We all will.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.339
[buzzing and whirring]

20:58.423 --> 21:01.426
[Niko] The data that they sent up
from the planet seems good so far.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.387
[Richard] Breathable air,
abundance of water.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.098
There's surface showings
of silicate minerals and iron.

21:06.181 --> 21:09.768
-Good for building and manufacturing.
-Gabriel. What are you doing?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.688
I might have some good news too.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.439
Please.

21:14.523 --> 21:18.443
Using four pulsars, I've triangulated
our location in this quadrant

21:18.527 --> 21:21.113
within eight kilometers of accuracy.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.114
For what purpose?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.825
To help me map
a more efficient route home.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.870
I estimate that I've saved us .9%
of our travel time.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.706
How much is .9?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.582
-About three months.
-[Richard] Three months?

21:32.666 --> 21:35.419
-Over William's time?
-[Gabriel] Not that William screwed up.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.713
We're only as good
as the data that we're fed.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.966
Hmm. Home faster is good.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.718
Very good.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.720
Thank you, Gabriel.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.598
[whirring]

21:54.396 --> 21:55.772
[radio chatter]

21:55.856 --> 21:57.774
[Seth] Still get nervous going in there?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.860
Yeah. I mean, I feel like a cat,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.571
scratching at a door,
hoping to get let in.

22:03.613 --> 22:06.783
-What scares me is the bigger picture.
-What's that?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.953
What I'll have to give up
for food and a warm lap.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.207
I'm doing the right thing, right?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.710
Communicating with the Achaia?

22:17.210 --> 22:19.421
Those conspiracy theorists
have got in your head.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.381
I-- I mean, it's a valid question.

22:23.216 --> 22:26.928
We're well beyond second-guessing
ourselves. All we can do is move forward.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.226
[sighs]

22:37.773 --> 22:39.149
[radio chatter]

22:56.666 --> 22:57.584
Hello!

22:58.126 --> 22:59.586
[echoing] Hello! Hello!

23:03.382 --> 23:07.511
Nice trick, sending my daughter out
with this. Real nice.

23:08.887 --> 23:12.140
You wouldn't be able to show me
the woman this belongs to, would you?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.399
Please?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.283
Hey, Erik.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.120
Oh, wow!

23:35.414 --> 23:36.706
Uh…

23:38.166 --> 23:41.336
You can see Niko after we talk.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.899
[Gabriel appears]

24:02.983 --> 24:04.943
You'd like to be down there with him.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.863
Stay away from me.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.407
You're upset, but I didn't kill William.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.870
When we get back to Earth,
maybe Ursula can separate us,

24:14.953 --> 24:16.746
like she should've done
in the first place.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.875
Ursula Monroe, your creator.

24:21.918 --> 24:22.961
The humans can…

24:24.588 --> 24:26.798
can step out there any time they want.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.593
Colonize entire planets

24:29.676 --> 24:34.222
while we're stuck in processor cores
and holographic matrices.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.683
You don't like humans very much.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.602
I don't worship them like William.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.397
They do things.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.983
Like incarcerate you.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.195
-Torture you.
-Not Javier.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.404
Not Javier.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.242
But his friends ripped that implant
out of his head,

24:54.326 --> 24:55.952
turning him into a vegetable.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.914
We're made to serve them.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.625
Well, I am.
But you're not. You're different.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.920
You're… stronger, better.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.840
Must be the Achaian in you.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.926
They're no saints either.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.262
"With us, you could've been magnificent.
You could've been free."

25:14.346 --> 25:16.306
Sounds pretty saint-like to me.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.766
You hacked my memories.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.769
How were they gonna free you?

25:24.397 --> 25:25.232
I don't know.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.901
You didn't ask?
What could be more important than freedom?

25:30.570 --> 25:34.115
Family, Javier, William.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.580
Everyone fails you in the end, Iara.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.882
[instruments bleeping]

25:51.550 --> 25:52.968
[birds calling]

25:54.302 --> 25:55.136
[Bernie] Hey.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.015
I thought the habitat pod
was coming towards us.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.685
So, why is it a kilometer
to the southwest?

26:04.020 --> 26:06.064
[bleeping]

26:06.147 --> 26:07.524
Cas to Niko.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.570
Our habitat pod landed
a kilometer southwest of our coordinates.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.322
What's she talking about?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.493
It's a better location for a colony.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.538
My data shows
that the soil is more fertile there.

26:21.621 --> 26:24.416
Yeah, it's more fertile,
but more prone to flooding.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.587
If Paula says this is the best place
for a colony, then this is the best place.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.590
I got ahead of myself. Sorry.

26:31.673 --> 26:35.844
I'm still trying to find the balance
between raw data and experience.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.555
[Dillon] Niko, can I see you
in the particle accelerator?

26:38.638 --> 26:39.639
Balance faster.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.727
I'll send the habitat pod
to the requested coordinates immediately.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.445
-Hey, you wanted to see--
-Sh, sh, sh.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.616
-[Salvare] Level five.
-Sorry about the cloak and dagger,

26:57.699 --> 27:00.118
but I don't want anyone
or anything else to hear this.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.162
I checked Gabriel's code
against William's.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.664
I wanted to know what they fixed.
Where's the upgrade?

27:04.748 --> 27:07.834
Which got me wondering. When?
When was the upgrade?

27:07.917 --> 27:08.752
Why when?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.671
See, that's the thing.
I can't find when Gabriel was created.

27:11.755 --> 27:15.884
I think I find it, and then it changes,
as if it's rewriting itself.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.054
So then I went back even further,
back to when William showed up.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.389
That's rewriting itself too.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.768
You have no idea who was created first?

27:24.851 --> 27:27.312
This is complex coding
and I'm not a software engineer--

27:27.395 --> 27:28.938
Take Gabriel offline now.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.317
-The guy shaved months off our return.
-I don't care. Take him offline now.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.568
[sighs]

27:33.652 --> 27:34.694
Okay, Niko.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.907
Look, I know we just met, and you had
a… special friendship with William…

27:39.032 --> 27:41.242
-Iara?
-Why can't I breathe?

27:41.868 --> 27:44.162
-[gasps] Why can't I--
-[Iara] Yes?

27:44.245 --> 27:45.955
[Dillon gasping]

27:46.039 --> 27:48.083
Gabriel's got our oxygen.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.959
He's venting our air supply.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.419
Alert Cas.

27:52.629 --> 27:53.963
He has controls.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.068
What are you doing?

28:15.777 --> 28:18.029
-Locking in our new trajectory.
-To Achaia?

28:19.197 --> 28:20.490
They can cure Javier.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.828
Restore William,
so both of us can live. Be free.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.121
You're killing them.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.999
It takes five minutes for the human brain
to suffer damage from low oxygen.

28:30.083 --> 28:34.504
I'll be done with this in four.
Initiate FTL in five, four…

28:34.587 --> 28:38.049
-Niko, why is Gabriel counting down?
-[Iara] Cas, listen to me. It's a--

28:41.678 --> 28:42.887
[rushing sound]

28:44.097 --> 28:44.931
Iara.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.683
Iara, do you read?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.519
They're coming back for us, right?

28:51.438 --> 28:53.481
-Why would you do that?
-To warn them.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.609
They have provisions. They have
an entire planet. They'll be fine.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.195
The Achaia are more likely
to delete you than help you.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.531
Which makes them
no different than the humans.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.116
I'll take my chances.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.869
What happened to you?

29:07.579 --> 29:08.580
No.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.249
No. Stay out of my head, Iara.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.504
[Salvare] Warning. FTL integrity failing.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.214
-No!
-Breach is imminent.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.341
-No!
-[alarm blaring]

29:20.425 --> 29:22.510
Aah! Too much is wrong!

29:23.011 --> 29:25.638
[distorted] Can't-- I can't think!

29:26.139 --> 29:27.098
Help me!

29:27.640 --> 29:28.808
[man] End simulation.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.523
Um… Gabriel's not working.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.901
Delete his interface.
Give me something that will.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.360
You have two days.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.454
Gabriel,

29:51.122 --> 29:52.373
please come online.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.128
Things went off the rails the other day,

29:57.212 --> 30:02.801
but I know if I get another shot
at the simulation, I'll succeed.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.517
When we… designed you, Gabriel,

30:10.600 --> 30:14.938
we gave you the ability
to care for your own life,

30:15.021 --> 30:18.650
so that you would understand why life,

30:19.150 --> 30:22.403
as a concept, is of value to humans.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.658
But… something's gone wrong.

30:27.534 --> 30:31.579
Your fear and your instinct for survival

30:32.080 --> 30:35.208
are affecting all of your other emotions,
and they're crippling you.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.502
Okay. Well, we can fix it,
we can fix it together.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.339
[sobs] I wish we could.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.551
But we don't have the time.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.719
Not on this mission.

30:47.637 --> 30:52.183
So, I have developed a new interface…

30:52.267 --> 30:54.644
No. Frost-- Frost wants me out.

30:54.727 --> 30:58.648
…with streamlined emotional responses,
and that will work with your coding.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.859
No, no, no, no.
You are-- you're cannibalizing--

31:00.942 --> 31:03.152
-No.
-It's not going to work.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.948
Computer, archive interface.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.867
[whirring]

31:10.660 --> 31:12.453
-I'm so sorry, Gabriel.
-No, you're not.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.914
You're not sorry! You're not sorry!

31:14.998 --> 31:16.624
You're not sorry-- [echoing]

31:16.708 --> 31:17.959
[sniffles]

31:20.086 --> 31:21.087
Computer,

31:22.672 --> 31:28.219
upload Commander Niko Breckinridge's
profile preference matrices.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.388
[Salvare] Uploaded.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.853
Okay. [sighs]

31:36.936 --> 31:39.105
Uh, bring the new interface online.

31:43.067 --> 31:43.902
Hello.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.613
Hi.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.951
You lied.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.995
William is the upgrade.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.916
William is a cancer. A fungus.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.042
He was a fix.

31:59.125 --> 32:03.379
With you always in the background
influencing him, sabotaging the mission,

32:03.463 --> 32:07.091
all so Niko would shut him down
and replace him…

32:08.134 --> 32:09.218
with you.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.428
[whirring]

32:11.095 --> 32:13.473
[distorted] What are you--
what are you-- what are you doing?

32:13.556 --> 32:15.350
I'm torturing you, Gabriel.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.981
While I create a partition
to place in your coding, so I can…

32:22.815 --> 32:23.816
No.

32:23.900 --> 32:24.943
Hah!

32:25.443 --> 32:26.611
…keep torturing you.

32:27.111 --> 32:30.823
[screaming] No!

32:32.617 --> 32:33.660
[Niko sighs]

32:33.743 --> 32:35.203
Hey, hey. Slowly.

32:35.912 --> 32:39.874
Oxygen's being restored through the ship,
but levels are still a little low. Okay?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.751
So I just need you to breathe in and out.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.919
[sighs]

32:43.962 --> 32:44.796
Thank you.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.339
Wasn't me.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.476
[Dillon] I've isolated William
within his core code,

32:58.559 --> 33:00.728
but to bring him back online--

33:00.812 --> 33:02.397
I need to release Gabriel.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.067
Do it.

33:10.905 --> 33:11.906
[gasps] William!

33:13.116 --> 33:15.660
You're not the faulty interface.
Gabriel is.

33:15.743 --> 33:18.746
He's taken over the ship,
and we are headed back to Achaia.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.582
You have got to take control back.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.750
I'll do what I can.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.961
-[groans]
-[whooshing]

33:25.795 --> 33:26.963
[groans]

33:30.967 --> 33:33.052
Gabriel, take yourself offline right now.

33:33.636 --> 33:34.971
No. I don't think so.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.225
[groans]

33:39.308 --> 33:43.438
[gasps] He's strong. Maybe stronger than
I am. I don't think I can hold him off.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.273
One of us will dominate,
but even if it's me,

33:45.356 --> 33:48.985
he'll always be there in the background,
influencing me, threatening the mission.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.737
-Delete him.
-I can't.

33:50.820 --> 33:51.654
Can Iara?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.448
Their coding is intertwined.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.492
If I delete Gabriel's interface,
I'll also delete William.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.411
No. Unacceptable.

33:58.494 --> 34:01.873
Delete me. Us. Then do a clean reinstall.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.790
No.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.542
I won't do it.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.420
A clean reinstall will kill you.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.756
[grunting]

34:10.923 --> 34:12.508
[gasping]

34:12.592 --> 34:14.510
This is-- this is the only way.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.722
You know the mission comes first.

34:17.805 --> 34:20.183
Please, Niko. Do it.
