01:38.300 --> 01:41.561
- Come on!
- You can blow better than that!

01:42.716 --> 01:43.796
Blow it!

04:05.774 --> 04:07.716
You all right, miss?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.724
I thought someone was following me.

04:10.894 --> 04:13.228
Would you like me
to walk you home?

04:14.061 --> 04:15.970
I live right there.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.983
Could you watch
to make sure I get in?

04:19.309 --> 04:20.901
Sure.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.098
Hey, Dad.

05:14.824 --> 05:16.547
Is he all right?

05:19.399 --> 05:22.082
Well, I don't know.
He hasn't got a collar.

05:22.247 --> 05:24.418
Looks like he's kind of hungry.

05:24.582 --> 05:26.306
Can we keep him?

05:27.078 --> 05:30.013
I don't know, honey. Maybe we ought
to take him to the pound.

05:30.183 --> 05:32.255
They'll find him a good home.

05:32.998 --> 05:35.419
What happens if they don't?

05:42.533 --> 05:46.395
<i>There's a big turnout for Monday Night
Football at the Superdome. New Orleans...</i>

05:46.564 --> 05:48.953
Hey, you know who should
be quarterbacking tonight?

05:49.125 --> 05:50.434
- Stabler.
- Me.

05:50.597 --> 05:52.866
We'll be ready to go in two minutes.

05:53.796 --> 05:57.592
<i>Stabler, still suffering from bruised
ribs and coming off a big game...</i>

05:57.764 --> 06:01.179
<i>... in a losing effort against
the Buccaneers last week.</i>

06:01.347 --> 06:04.642
<i>The Saints out-gained
Tampa Bay by 100 yards...</i>

06:04.803 --> 06:07.290
Here you are, partner.

06:27.425 --> 06:28.887
Damn it.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.518
Yeah?

06:33.441 --> 06:35.164
Right.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.766
Sorry, girls.

07:24.571 --> 07:27.440
- Any ID?
- A purse.

07:52.056 --> 07:55.252
- What do you think?
- I think she died on the bed.

07:55.993 --> 07:59.254
She couldn't have been killed
in here and dragged in there?

07:59.416 --> 08:01.685
Possible, but not likely.

08:01.911 --> 08:02.860
What time, about?

08:03.031 --> 08:08.148
Well, from the rigor mortis and body
temp, about 18 to 20 hours ago.

08:19.222 --> 08:23.150
<i>Hi, honey. We just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.</i>

08:23.318 --> 08:25.685
<i>Dad yelled
to say he loves you.</i>

08:25.846 --> 08:29.522
<i>We're excited you'll be
home for the weekend. Bye, dear.</i>

08:33.236 --> 08:37.971
He says she died 18 to 20 hours ago. That
would've made it no sooner than midnight.

08:38.131 --> 08:39.179
So what?

08:39.347 --> 08:43.438
That clock looked like it was broke
in the struggle. If it says 9:15...

08:44.532 --> 08:46.801
...why wasn't she killed
until midnight?

08:47.283 --> 08:50.632
Maybe someone wanted
three hours with her first.

08:54.098 --> 08:57.447
I want everybody on this block
interviewed. That's the neighbors...

08:57.619 --> 08:59.724
...mailmen, garbage people.

08:59.890 --> 09:04.592
In fact, I want every garbage can and every
sewer looked into for a five-block radius.

09:14.225 --> 09:16.461
You think it brings the crazies out?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.654
They're always out.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.549
Good evening, Mrs. Holstein.
How are those kids?

09:28.719 --> 09:31.534
Fine, they're asleep.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.321
Jesus.

10:33.162 --> 10:36.129
Death came from strangulation.
Ligature marks on her throat...

10:36.297 --> 10:38.053
...and hemorrhages around her neck.

10:38.217 --> 10:41.217
There are also two parallel, slightly
indented marks on her wrists.

10:41.385 --> 10:43.621
- From what?
- Handcuffs, possibly.

10:43.784 --> 10:47.013
There are bruises on her arms and shoulder
blades from being pinned to the floor.

10:47.176 --> 10:49.542
And what looks
like a knee-bruise on her chest.

10:49.703 --> 10:53.729
Before she died, she was
penetrated both vaginally and anally.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.486
- What time did she die?
- Close to midnight.

10:56.647 --> 11:00.422
- You sure?
- She ate a piece of banana cake at 7:00.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.844
Then, over the next hour and a half,
consumed eight ounces of white wine.

11:04.006 --> 11:05.184
Chardonnay, I believe.

11:05.350 --> 11:09.888
Then finished at 9:00 with a small amount
of Swiss vanilla almond ice cream.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.022
Anything else, detective?

11:16.997 --> 11:18.491
Take a look.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.891
First one is a human scalp hair.

11:21.316 --> 11:25.210
The bulbous portion of the root is still
attached, meaning it was wrenched out.

11:25.380 --> 11:29.122
The next one, the tapered one,
is an eyebrow hair.

11:30.819 --> 11:33.634
And the one
at the bottom is a pubic hair.

11:33.795 --> 11:36.926
- All from the same person?
- Dark-haired Caucasian.

11:37.091 --> 11:41.182
- Probably male, probably in his 40s.
- You're really nailing him down for me.

11:41.347 --> 11:45.208
- What more do you want?
- His phone number and address.

11:45.378 --> 11:47.069
His semen.

11:47.586 --> 11:52.320
- What blood type?
- O. Just like the night before last.

11:52.482 --> 11:56.126
This is a common, everyday rayon
and acetate fiber.

11:56.289 --> 11:59.584
I found it sticking to the back
of Melanie Silber's neck.

11:59.745 --> 12:03.607
And I found this one
under Yvonne Larkin's fingernail.

12:05.761 --> 12:08.826
You know, the killer didn't leave
any prints this time either.

12:08.992 --> 12:13.148
Every print in the bedroom matched Melanie
Silber's. But there's one thing I don't get.

12:13.311 --> 12:14.456
What?

12:14.752 --> 12:17.468
There was a cup on the dresser
with traces of coffee.

12:17.631 --> 12:21.886
- There weren't any prints on it.
- I saw it. So what?

12:22.815 --> 12:25.848
Why would he take the time
to drink a cup of coffee?

12:27.070 --> 12:29.787
He was starting to enjoy himself.

12:33.278 --> 12:38.198
Wes, Beryl Thibodeaux from the rape
something-or-other wants to see you.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.372
- Where is she?
- The reception room.

12:40.541 --> 12:43.257
- Tell her I'm out.
- I did. She said she'd wait.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.809
Good. Tell her I'm out of town.

12:48.412 --> 12:49.819
Welcome back.

12:52.251 --> 12:53.909
Thanks.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.528
I've tried calling you five times.

12:57.852 --> 12:59.477
Sorry.

13:00.507 --> 13:02.449
Look, I'm not particularly eager to...

13:02.619 --> 13:05.269
...talk to women who go around
with chips on their shoulders...

13:05.435 --> 13:09.046
...tell everybody I'm doing a lousy job
and get everybody pissed off at me.

13:09.466 --> 13:12.117
I wouldn't be eager
to talk to them either.

13:12.570 --> 13:16.366
I'm really not eager to talk to cops
who have a chip on their shoulders...

13:16.538 --> 13:20.661
...stereotype women from rape centers
and then go to any length to avoid them.

13:20.825 --> 13:23.760
I'm sure you don't care
for those kinds of cops either.

13:25.881 --> 13:28.401
Another woman was strangled
last night.

13:28.569 --> 13:30.990
Now, we're concerned
it could be the same killer.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.615
- Why?
- Because she was killed in the same way.

13:33.784 --> 13:37.078
And also because we heard a rumor
the murders might be connected.

13:37.496 --> 13:41.554
- Well, you know how it is with rumors.
- But it could be the same person.

13:41.879 --> 13:45.839
- That possibility always exists.
- Do you have any evidence?

13:46.006 --> 13:48.756
I'm not at liberty to discuss evidence
in this case.

13:48.919 --> 13:52.115
Have you been able to establish
a link between the victims?

13:52.598 --> 13:54.802
I can't discuss that either.
I'm sorry.

13:54.966 --> 13:59.602
Look, all I'm asking is to be involved
in the investigation, all right?

13:59.765 --> 14:02.187
Maybe we could put
up some warning posters.

14:02.613 --> 14:06.126
That say what? That some nut's going
around the city strangling women?

14:06.293 --> 14:09.162
- Yeah, why not?
- Because we're not sure it's true.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.049
All it would do is terrify women
all over this city.

14:12.308 --> 14:14.250
Well, maybe it should.

14:48.465 --> 14:50.537
Did you brush your teeth?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.758
Well, you better get going.

14:57.456 --> 14:59.310
Give your dad a smack.

15:00.879 --> 15:02.766
Bye-bye, baby.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.222
Come on, kids.
We got a big day.

15:53.963 --> 15:57.574
- You want some honey?
- I don't eat sweets.

15:58.219 --> 16:01.349
Do you eat drumsticks, mister?

16:06.409 --> 16:09.475
- Need any help?
- Not on this one.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.677
Who is it?

16:39.974 --> 16:41.796
May I come in?

16:48.838 --> 16:52.863
I heard you two worked together.

16:53.733 --> 16:55.675
Doing what?

16:56.228 --> 16:58.497
As a sandwich.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.962
One on the top and the other
on the bottom.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.954
Well, what else did you hear?

17:07.395 --> 17:09.534
That you liked it.

17:09.700 --> 17:13.627
That you liked her,
but she split on you.

17:15.682 --> 17:18.781
She developed a taste for cops.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.915
She get close to any?

17:22.914 --> 17:25.631
Cops don't get close to anybody.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.749
Any of them come on to her?

17:35.424 --> 17:37.399
They kept coming...

17:38.912 --> 17:44.029
...and coming.
That's the funny thing about cops.

17:48.032 --> 17:52.887
You take a cop whose wife splits...

17:58.079 --> 18:00.020
...sooner...

18:01.662 --> 18:03.637
...or later...

18:05.534 --> 18:07.323
...that cop...

18:10.141 --> 18:13.370
...will react like anybody else.

18:17.725 --> 18:20.888
He'll start doing things...

18:22.076 --> 18:25.043
...he wouldn't have done before.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.818
So, Block...

18:40.987 --> 18:44.216
...what happened to the rest
of the sandwich?

18:59.865 --> 19:01.969
Somebody ate it.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.214
You're 10 minutes late.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.164
Yeah. Ten minutes
after he's down there...

19:42.325 --> 19:45.838
...he won't know the difference between
the big hand and the little hand.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.017
Promise?

19:49.076 --> 19:50.669
Trust me.

21:25.291 --> 21:27.080
You're still awake.

21:27.243 --> 21:30.025
- What's the matter?
- Can't sleep.

21:34.441 --> 21:37.987
- Where did you go?
- To his house.

21:38.857 --> 21:41.988
- What's it like?
- Big.

21:42.249 --> 21:47.912
- She ask about me?
- No, but I told her about you anyway.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.713
Where did you go tonight?

21:53.704 --> 21:55.646
Out to look for something.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.570
Did you find it?

21:59.528 --> 22:02.561
I found out one thing.
You know what it is?

22:02.728 --> 22:05.695
That you should be in bed,
getting some sleep.

22:20.806 --> 22:21.754
Hello?

22:37.732 --> 22:39.739
- It looks like the same method.
- Go ahead.

22:39.908 --> 22:41.817
So how old is this one?

22:45.891 --> 22:47.549
He found her.

22:48.163 --> 22:51.064
- Do you filter on that drain?
- Yeah.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.147
Empty it.

22:53.314 --> 22:55.485
How long has she been in here?

22:57.122 --> 22:58.616
About an hour.

23:06.338 --> 23:09.185
- Anybody in here with her?
- Not that I saw.

23:42.365 --> 23:44.504
From the hot tub's drain.

23:45.630 --> 23:49.426
And this is the brownie found
in Melanie Silber's apartment.

23:49.597 --> 23:52.117
This is the mold
I made from her teeth.

23:52.285 --> 23:54.968
The mold doesn't match
the impression.

23:55.133 --> 23:58.994
I'll coat the bite mark pattern
on the brownie and run it under the SEM.

23:59.164 --> 24:02.197
We might get a reading
that'll match the killer's teeth.

24:04.060 --> 24:07.889
Thirty calls already, three from
a Beryl Thibodeaux at the Rape Center.

24:08.059 --> 24:13.144
Check on the specific days of the crimes,
meteorological reports, phases of the moon.

24:13.307 --> 24:18.325
Would you check CID and find out for
similar m.o.'s? And check all 42s in the area.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.239
Get a tail on that hot-tub guy,
would you?

24:21.882 --> 24:24.915
Check out all sexual arrests
in the town for the last two weeks.

24:25.082 --> 24:29.337
That goes for somebody who's been humping
sheep to some guy who's swinging his dick.

24:29.498 --> 24:31.985
- You got it.
- Here's the file.

24:33.177 --> 24:35.032
Here he comes, Tim.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.664
Detective Block,
are the murders connected?

24:40.088 --> 24:44.496
Yes, we believe that the murders
were committed by the same killer.

24:44.663 --> 24:50.359
So far, the victims have all been women
linked to unusual or aberrant sexual activity.

24:50.519 --> 24:54.064
We recommend, however, that all
women exercise extreme caution...

24:54.231 --> 24:56.686
...until this killer is apprehended.

24:57.623 --> 24:58.571
Thank you.

24:58.743 --> 25:01.459
- Do you have any clues?
- I can't talk about it.

25:12.117 --> 25:14.059
What's a hard-on, Daddy?

25:16.021 --> 25:18.770
I heard Amanda say it,
and she won't tell me what it means.

25:24.404 --> 25:26.313
Well, darling, it's...

25:26.484 --> 25:28.044
It's...

25:28.211 --> 25:31.953
When a man is attracted
to a woman...

25:32.115 --> 25:34.254
...he likes her.

25:34.419 --> 25:37.288
- Understand?
- No.

25:39.859 --> 25:42.673
Well, he likes her in a certain way.

25:43.602 --> 25:45.424
Why?

25:45.778 --> 25:50.251
Well, sweetheart, male bears
like female bears and...

25:51.057 --> 25:54.024
...male bees like female bees...

25:54.193 --> 25:56.364
...and occasionally they get together...

25:56.529 --> 25:58.023
Dad...

25:59.249 --> 26:01.071
...forget it.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.421
You recognize this?

26:40.108 --> 26:42.563
- Why should I?
- You drew it.

26:42.828 --> 26:45.894
- So what?
- Well, tell me about it.

26:47.532 --> 26:51.939
Jamie Cory, she come here one day
saying this hot-tub guy beat her up.

26:52.491 --> 26:55.622
She wanted a tattoo,
so I did it.

26:56.523 --> 27:00.134
Well, the hot-tub guy says she came
down here and you beat her up.

27:00.843 --> 27:03.810
Do I look like the kind of guy
who'd do something like that?

27:04.170 --> 27:05.599
Yeah.

27:07.946 --> 27:10.815
You ever heard of a girl
named Melanie Silber?

27:12.745 --> 27:15.560
Yeah, I like to beat her up too.

27:16.201 --> 27:18.852
You know, everybody's looking
to get beat up.

27:24.168 --> 27:27.551
- What's your name?
- Block.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.168
You're hanging out
with the wrong kind of people, Block.

27:31.656 --> 27:34.111
What kind would you suggest
I hang out with?

27:34.536 --> 27:36.608
Someone who's more...

27:37.255 --> 27:38.978
...up your alley.

27:40.199 --> 27:42.403
Maybe I'll take you
up on that sometime.

27:42.759 --> 27:44.417
And do what?

27:45.255 --> 27:47.840
Take you bowling?

27:48.966 --> 27:51.071
I don't like bowling.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.219
Neither do I.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.112
Tequila.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.570
- How you doing, Shorty?
- Hello.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.766
- You know Jamie Cory?
- Sure, she wrestled here last night.

29:40.059 --> 29:42.164
You know much about her?

29:42.715 --> 29:45.399
Not as much as I'd have liked to.

29:45.595 --> 29:49.010
Try the blonde with the big bazookas.

30:26.423 --> 30:29.554
- Ice?
- What for?

30:30.871 --> 30:32.911
You didn't mention you knew her.

30:33.078 --> 30:34.671
You didn't ask.

30:34.838 --> 30:38.515
Besides, I thought you came here...

30:39.094 --> 30:40.916
...to bowl.

30:41.301 --> 30:44.149
You recall seeing her
with anyone last night?

30:44.310 --> 30:47.986
- Yeah. There were a couple of guys.
- Who?

30:48.149 --> 30:51.946
Customers.
You know, guys trying to hit on her.

30:52.245 --> 30:54.285
She let any of them?

30:54.740 --> 30:59.115
- No. She thought they were creeps.
- What about other nights?

30:59.924 --> 31:04.234
If she liked someone,
she might've done something about it.

31:04.403 --> 31:07.884
But by and large, just one-night stands?

31:08.051 --> 31:10.506
Are there any other kind?

31:13.299 --> 31:16.877
And you two knew each other very well?

31:17.970 --> 31:19.758
Well enough.

31:21.778 --> 31:25.706
Did she ever mention anything
about anybody using handcuffs on her?

31:28.465 --> 31:32.011
I think so.
She liked to get pretty kinky.

31:33.232 --> 31:35.785
Remember who it might've been?

31:36.272 --> 31:40.167
I think it was a cop.

31:41.392 --> 31:44.425
Who knows? Maybe it was you.

33:23.238 --> 33:25.377
Can I help with anything?

33:36.581 --> 33:39.810
Dad, how come you have to work
so late every night?

33:43.012 --> 33:45.499
Well, there's been three murders, hon.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.699
Couldn't you just work during the day?

33:51.523 --> 33:54.076
Some people I can only see at night.

33:54.915 --> 33:56.922
What kind of people?

33:58.083 --> 34:00.384
People that don't have day jobs.

34:08.225 --> 34:09.981
Dad?

34:11.713 --> 34:13.688
Could you get hurt?

34:21.824 --> 34:25.053
Tell me, Wes, how's things at home?

34:25.984 --> 34:27.893
What do you mean?

34:28.127 --> 34:31.804
I mean, I'm not sure yet you're ready
to run this task force.

34:31.967 --> 34:35.960
Beryl Thibodeaux talked to the mayor
about you, and he called me.

34:36.127 --> 34:41.145
He said if I don't come up with something
soon, he's gonna start shitting all over me.

34:43.646 --> 34:46.679
Shit runs downhill, Wes.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.976
Yeah.

34:50.973 --> 34:53.340
No! Louder.

34:53.501 --> 34:56.315
No! Again.

34:56.509 --> 34:57.938
No!

34:58.109 --> 34:59.091
Stop!

35:00.060 --> 35:02.515
- Again.
- Stop!

35:02.877 --> 35:04.786
- No!
- One more time.

35:04.957 --> 35:07.346
- Stop!
- All right.

35:07.516 --> 35:13.266
Now, in most of the situations
you'll encounter...

35:14.683 --> 35:19.800
...you will have several options.
Most important, don't stop thinking.

35:20.347 --> 35:25.813
He's counting on you going catatonic and
being petrified with fear and surrendering.

35:25.978 --> 35:27.439
Keep thinking.

35:27.610 --> 35:31.472
First, you could try
and reason with him.

35:31.993 --> 35:35.703
Now, if that doesn't work,
blow your whistle. Start yelling.

35:35.866 --> 35:38.800
The yell we've just learned, yell it out.

35:38.969 --> 35:43.191
I mean, don't forget he's got his adrenaline
going. You make sure you pump up yours.

35:43.416 --> 35:48.751
At this point, our goal
is to disable your attacker.

35:48.920 --> 35:53.011
Now, several ways of sending
him a message are:

35:53.848 --> 35:56.303
Stomping on his toes.

35:57.783 --> 36:00.118
Scratching his eyes.

36:00.311 --> 36:05.362
Hitting this vital point
here in the throat.

36:05.527 --> 36:08.210
Kicking into his kneecaps.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.374
Striking his solar plexus.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.990
And if he still keeps on acting tacky...

36:15.158 --> 36:18.289
...well then, you can always drop back...

36:18.933 --> 36:20.591
...and punt.

36:27.285 --> 36:28.626
Hi.

36:39.476 --> 36:42.443
I'll bet you were just about to knock.

36:42.995 --> 36:46.857
Actually, I was just gonna
hang out here and be tacky.

36:50.418 --> 36:53.647
Tell me, Detective Blot...

36:54.482 --> 36:56.075
Block.

36:56.242 --> 36:57.518
Wes Block.

36:57.681 --> 37:00.714
- How do you like the Rape Center?
- I love it.

37:00.881 --> 37:04.143
Would you care to make
a charitable donation?

37:04.689 --> 37:07.689
- Any reason I should?
- Yeah.

37:07.857 --> 37:09.450
Maybe...

37:09.616 --> 37:11.307
Maybe I'll talk about the mayor.

37:11.824 --> 37:14.125
Yeah, I hear you go out with him.

37:15.344 --> 37:17.002
Once in a while.

37:17.296 --> 37:19.532
I hear he's gay.

37:20.367 --> 37:22.636
You like a date with him?

37:23.087 --> 37:25.192
Well, I would like him off my back.

37:25.359 --> 37:29.635
Oh, don't tell me he's interrupted
your busy schedule.

37:29.903 --> 37:31.496
Awful, ain't it?

37:32.142 --> 37:35.687
Yeah, well maybe you should've told him
you were out of town.

37:39.950 --> 37:43.211
Listen, I called him...

37:43.501 --> 37:48.585
...because I'm playing by your rules.
Now, if you'd help me, I'd like to help you.

37:53.324 --> 37:56.739
The killer's a Caucasian,
blood type o...

37:56.908 --> 38:00.901
...about in his mid-40s. We found traces
of a red fiber on all the victims.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.362
From what?

38:04.939 --> 38:06.662
We don't know.

38:07.339 --> 38:13.252
- Any suspects?
- About 120,000 of them.

38:14.155 --> 38:16.969
Anything you'd like me to tell the mayor?

38:17.674 --> 38:20.707
Yeah. He's one of them.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.175
Daddy!

38:41.032 --> 38:43.007
Hi, pumpkin!

38:43.656 --> 38:45.630
- Am I heavy?
- Not to me, you're not.

38:45.799 --> 38:48.220
I weigh 50 now.

38:49.479 --> 38:52.228
- I missed you.
- Well, I missed you too, sweetheart.

38:52.391 --> 38:56.995
I tried to call a lot, but the phone's been
busy. You and your sister sure are gabby.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.900
Did your mother call?

39:07.941 --> 39:10.396
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.468
Mind if I have one?

39:15.812 --> 39:18.048
I heard you had a phone call.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.025
She's getting married.

39:22.723 --> 39:25.822
She wants us to come to the wedding.

39:26.275 --> 39:30.072
She also said something
about having us come live with her.

39:30.467 --> 39:34.209
- Could she do that?
- I don't know, baby.

39:35.683 --> 39:38.071
I used to make these for her.

39:38.466 --> 39:42.689
- I know.
- But I like making them for you better.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.062
Seen any of these?

40:04.959 --> 40:06.715
No.

40:08.992 --> 40:11.326
No. Too bad.

40:13.342 --> 40:15.895
Yeah. I've seen her in here before.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.683
Anybody ever get violent
with her?

40:19.774 --> 40:22.327
That's part of the turn-on, isn't it?

40:22.558 --> 40:24.565
You know who it was?

40:25.918 --> 40:27.674
No.

40:30.173 --> 40:34.428
Hey, what about you?
You ever see her in here before?

40:35.772 --> 40:37.496
No.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.640
You recognize her?

41:19.832 --> 41:21.621
No.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.032
Why don't you come on in?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.243
Close the door.

44:47.493 --> 44:50.973
- When did they find it?
- About 20 minutes ago.

45:05.891 --> 45:06.839
What's up?

45:07.011 --> 45:09.596
Smudge marks
from Melanie Silber's bedroom.

45:09.762 --> 45:13.340
- Can you tell anything?
- Yeah. It's mostly good old dirt.

45:13.506 --> 45:17.117
- What about this morning?
- There were cuff marks on her wrists.

45:19.586 --> 45:21.789
Anything else?

45:23.041 --> 45:24.470
This.

45:36.352 --> 45:40.126
Struck out with the hot-tub guy.
Wrong blood type.

45:41.216 --> 45:43.103
- Maybe we should...
- What was her name?

45:43.519 --> 45:45.526
Who?

45:46.015 --> 45:48.252
The girl at the river.

45:48.927 --> 45:51.741
Judy Harper, a nurse.

46:00.477 --> 46:02.997
Every mass murderer has a motive, Wes.

46:03.165 --> 46:06.907
It could be as bizarre as voices
commanding him to kill.

46:07.069 --> 46:10.298
The voices could come from God
or from the refrigerator.

46:10.461 --> 46:14.617
Or it could be as simple as anger,
frustration, revenge.

46:14.780 --> 46:18.325
That's why he uses handcuffs
on the women.

46:19.036 --> 46:21.523
- Has he contacted you?
- No.

46:21.692 --> 46:25.107
- I wouldn't be surprised if he did.
- Why?

46:25.628 --> 46:29.457
Once you started going after him,
you became closer to him than anyone else.

46:29.626 --> 46:33.238
Unless there's another psychopath
out doing the same thing.

46:35.354 --> 46:37.940
I'm not sure how close I wanna get.

46:38.330 --> 46:41.199
There's a darkness inside all of us, Wes.

46:41.370 --> 46:44.184
You, me and the man
down the street.

46:44.410 --> 46:47.409
Some have it under control.
Others act it out.

46:47.577 --> 46:51.603
The rest of us try to walk a tightrope
between the two.

48:59.661 --> 49:02.311
Wanna go hoist some oysters?

49:06.828 --> 49:11.683
- I've never seen you work out there before.
- I came there looking for you.

49:12.492 --> 49:15.590
- They found another body.
- I know.

49:15.755 --> 49:19.137
- Sorry about it.
- Well, why tell me?

49:19.307 --> 49:21.762
I didn't know who else to tell.

49:36.969 --> 49:39.489
You didn't have to bring me here
to tell me that.

49:39.657 --> 49:41.282
No.

49:43.176 --> 49:46.340
- Thank you.
- So why did you?

49:47.080 --> 49:49.797
Well, I saw you working out in that gym.

49:49.960 --> 49:52.643
I was wondering what you'd be like.

49:54.471 --> 49:57.602
Why the sudden interest?

50:00.454 --> 50:03.520
I was wondering if you came alone.

50:04.294 --> 50:06.366
What else were you wondering?

50:09.030 --> 50:10.885
You really wanna know?

50:11.206 --> 50:13.061
Yeah.

50:14.501 --> 50:16.705
What it would be like...

50:16.965 --> 50:19.965
...to lick the sweat off your body.

50:27.812 --> 50:29.535
Do you...?

50:29.892 --> 50:32.194
Do you always say
exactly what's on your mind?

50:32.612 --> 50:34.684
You don't like it?

50:35.491 --> 50:37.728
It could be a little more subtle.

50:38.147 --> 50:40.034
What I said?

50:40.419 --> 50:43.233
More the way you said it.

50:43.491 --> 50:45.346
How would you like me to say it?

50:45.698 --> 50:49.113
As if you're not saying it
to somebody every night.

50:49.954 --> 50:52.093
What else would you like?

50:52.258 --> 50:56.218
I'd like to find out what's underneath
the front you put on.

51:00.929 --> 51:05.784
- Maybe you wouldn't like what you'd find.
- Maybe you're scared I would.

51:22.911 --> 51:25.780
- You're not married, are you?
- What makes you say that?

51:25.950 --> 51:27.772
Just a hunch.

51:28.414 --> 51:31.414
You hear the one about the cop
whose wife left him a note...

51:31.582 --> 51:34.615
...saying she'd fallen in love
with anyone else?

51:35.806 --> 51:40.627
- Your wife leave you a note?
- No, she left me two kids.

51:41.949 --> 51:45.396
- Where is she now?
- Still here in New orleans.

51:47.293 --> 51:49.016
You ever thought of moving away?

51:49.180 --> 51:53.686
No. Twenty-eight years ago,
I borrowed $40 from my father...

51:53.852 --> 51:57.397
...packed up an old, beat-up suitcase,
took a bus and came here.

51:57.563 --> 52:00.018
I was 17 at the time.

52:00.315 --> 52:04.592
I walked down through the French quarter,
looked out over the Mississippi...

52:04.763 --> 52:06.356
...and swore I'd never leave.

52:06.523 --> 52:09.392
- Ever come close?
- Only once.

52:09.562 --> 52:12.726
When I looked down
and saw that suitcase missing.

52:13.306 --> 52:15.477
Have you ever been married?

52:15.642 --> 52:18.489
- Nope.
- How come?

52:20.409 --> 52:23.278
I guess I haven't met the right man.

52:25.625 --> 52:27.796
Maybe I scared him away.

52:27.961 --> 52:30.579
Then he definitely wasn't the right man.

52:33.208 --> 52:37.266
- My mother thinks it's my job.
- What do you think?

52:37.496 --> 52:41.903
- Doesn't matter. I like what I do.
- Helping women?

52:42.839 --> 52:44.748
Oh, men too.

52:45.207 --> 52:47.727
What makes you so sure they need it?

52:47.990 --> 52:50.259
We all need it.

52:59.509 --> 53:03.851
Okay, gals, come on. Wake up. Come on.
We're gonna go back to our own beds now.

53:04.021 --> 53:05.908
- Hi, Dad.
- Where you been?

53:06.069 --> 53:08.883
Get Dad. Come on. Get on my back.

53:10.037 --> 53:12.175
Your dad had a date tonight.

53:12.340 --> 53:14.031
Who with?

53:14.740 --> 53:16.267
Somebody he met.

53:16.436 --> 53:18.737
- Where'd you go?
- Out on the river.

53:18.899 --> 53:21.103
- Is she nice?
- Oh, yeah.

53:21.268 --> 53:23.504
- Do you like her?
- Yeah, she's nice.

53:23.667 --> 53:26.962
- Did you kiss her?
- Hey, come on. Give me a break, will you?

53:27.315 --> 53:29.966
I bet that's her right now.

53:30.130 --> 53:35.662
And she wants to see you again. And you
can have a hard-on anytime you want.

53:46.577 --> 53:49.327
"Another one will soon be dead.

53:50.097 --> 53:52.944
You could stop it
if you knew what was ahead."

53:53.264 --> 53:55.271
Think it's from a crank?

53:57.168 --> 53:58.793
No.

54:01.776 --> 54:04.874
Sam's. What's that?

54:10.415 --> 54:12.455
I'm Sam.

54:54.090 --> 54:55.978
You're strong.

54:56.522 --> 54:59.871
I love being punished by a strong man.

55:05.034 --> 55:08.132
He said you'd want this.

55:09.321 --> 55:12.321
- What for?
- Me.

55:12.745 --> 55:14.206
He's wrong.

55:19.016 --> 55:21.220
He said you were just like him.

55:21.384 --> 55:23.239
Who's he?

55:28.359 --> 55:30.247
Use the whip.

55:38.662 --> 55:40.320
You're...

55:40.486 --> 55:43.236
You're to wear this to Praline's.

55:46.822 --> 55:48.927
I don't know who he is.

56:19.362 --> 56:21.085
Dixie.

56:22.850 --> 56:25.053
Looking for something...

56:25.602 --> 56:27.358
...Alice?

57:03.838 --> 57:06.326
He said this was your first time.

57:06.718 --> 57:09.401
- Who?
- You don't know?

57:10.909 --> 57:14.651
- He bought me for you.
- You've seen him?

57:16.125 --> 57:18.100
When was he supposed to pay you?

57:18.269 --> 57:22.360
Right after this at the old warehouse
across the street.

57:25.980 --> 57:30.322
Well, you go on over to that warehouse
and collect your money.

57:31.067 --> 57:33.653
- You don't want it?
- No.

57:33.820 --> 57:36.721
He said you did.
You just don't know it yet.

57:37.307 --> 57:39.412
Well, he's wrong.

57:40.539 --> 57:43.092
How do you know if you haven't tried it?

57:43.675 --> 57:45.431
Maybe I have.

57:50.906 --> 57:54.288
I'm at a warehouse at 1460 Water.

01:01:02.503 --> 01:01:05.350
We searched the whole warehouse.
He's gone.

01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:09.027
- The saliva on the stamps tested...
- Blood type o.

01:01:09.191 --> 01:01:10.173
Right.

01:01:10.374 --> 01:01:12.676
The notes are from...

01:01:13.158 --> 01:01:16.474
...a '72 olivetti. The letters E
and S are worn down.

01:01:16.646 --> 01:01:19.907
The K is misaligned.
That's all I can tell.

01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:23.681
- What about the red ribbon?
- Same as the fibers from the other victims.

01:01:30.276 --> 01:01:32.643
"...if you knew what's ahead."

01:03:00.924 --> 01:03:02.549
Becky?

01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:20.851
Becky?

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:31.156
Becky?

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:01.196
She could still be alive.

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.396
Couldn't she?

01:04:14.485 --> 01:04:16.307
Still no sign?

01:04:16.725 --> 01:04:18.612
It won't be long.

01:04:21.972 --> 01:04:23.565
Any luck with him?

01:04:23.892 --> 01:04:25.266
No.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.827
You're letting him go?

01:04:28.756 --> 01:04:30.185
Yeah.

01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:34.160
I heard you knew her too.

01:04:35.891 --> 01:04:37.036
That's right.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:42.828
Just out of curiosity, Wes, did you happen
to know any of the other victims?

01:04:48.082 --> 01:04:49.772
No.

01:05:08.336 --> 01:05:09.830
Alex?

01:05:10.863 --> 01:05:13.613
Do you have someone
who could drive by my house?

01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:15.342
Your kids?

01:05:16.207 --> 01:05:18.662
- Yeah.
- Sure.

01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:27.806
You remember the smudge marks
in Melanie Silber's bedroom?

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.239
- The killer made them.
- How do you know?

01:07:30.402 --> 01:07:34.296
Because they have the same chemical
composition as particles on that doll.

01:07:34.466 --> 01:07:37.727
- Any idea what they are?
- Some kind of glass fragments...

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.061
...coated with a barley residue.

01:07:40.226 --> 01:07:44.382
- Where could they come from?
- Who knows? Maybe a grain storage bin.

01:07:44.545 --> 01:07:48.122
He must've picked up the fragments
in the treads of his tennis shoes.

01:07:48.288 --> 01:07:50.263
He wore tennis shoes?

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:53.336
By tomorrow,
I might even know the make.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:03.420
- Hello?
- Hi. Can I see you tonight?

01:08:04.415 --> 01:08:07.382
- I've got some work.
- Can it wait?

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.099
Are you okay?

01:08:12.828 --> 01:08:14.486
I don't know.

01:10:14.928 --> 01:10:17.481
They found one of the bodies
near here.

01:10:17.648 --> 01:10:19.240
I know.

01:10:19.696 --> 01:10:23.373
- They're getting closer.
- Closer to what?

01:10:23.536 --> 01:10:25.062
To me.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.820
Boo!

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:36.101
Do you investigate
many sexual crimes?

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:37.797
Why?

01:10:39.213 --> 01:10:41.995
I was wondering
if they've had any effect on you.

01:10:43.502 --> 01:10:47.298
Well, they did make me want
to treat my wife a little more tenderly.

01:10:47.821 --> 01:10:49.512
How did she respond?

01:10:50.957 --> 01:10:54.022
She said she wasn't
interested in tenderness.

01:11:00.748 --> 01:11:02.689
They're nice kids.

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:06.536
Yeah, they're about the only thing
in my life I haven't screwed up.

01:11:06.699 --> 01:11:09.186
Well, some people
don't even have that.

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:18.982
Why didn't your wife take them
when she left?

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.818
Because they're a part
of what she left.

01:11:24.329 --> 01:11:26.336
What did you tell them?

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.974
I didn't tell them anything.
They already knew.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.331
Do they get jealous
when you bring a woman over?

01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:43.591
I don't bring a woman home.

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:46.338
How about that woman
you just bumped into?

01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:50.397
She's just sort of a friend.

01:11:51.527 --> 01:11:56.644
That kind of friend have anything
to do with your wife leaving?

01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:01.060
I made those kind of friends
after she left.

01:12:02.086 --> 01:12:04.573
Can we come back
tomorrow night, Daddy?

01:12:04.934 --> 01:12:07.421
We'll talk about that later.

01:12:11.397 --> 01:12:13.306
I want a balloon.

01:12:13.636 --> 01:12:15.425
Here, I got it.

01:12:16.005 --> 01:12:18.143
Here you are.

01:12:23.076 --> 01:12:24.832
Yeah.

01:12:36.003 --> 01:12:37.279
Come on.

01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:10.100
Dad?

01:13:10.271 --> 01:13:12.954
Beryl's nice.
She's pretty too. Don't you think?

01:13:13.119 --> 01:13:14.679
Yeah.

01:13:14.847 --> 01:13:16.702
I can tell she wants
to see you again.

01:13:16.863 --> 01:13:18.805
You can, can you?

01:13:18.974 --> 01:13:22.007
If I were you, I'd ask her out
this weekend.

01:13:22.174 --> 01:13:24.029
You would, would you?

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.163
Dad...

01:13:26.558 --> 01:13:30.551
...find out if she likes dogs.
- Oh, of course.

01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:36.121
You'll have to excuse the mess.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.275
Well, you should see
my place sometimes.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.718
I don't exactly have
a lot of help around here.

01:13:58.618 --> 01:14:02.774
Now, why do you think
he uses handcuffs?

01:14:03.034 --> 01:14:04.943
Control?

01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:08.879
Do you use them very often?

01:14:11.673 --> 01:14:13.331
Well, that depends.

01:14:14.745 --> 01:14:16.436
On what?

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:18.991
The situation.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.008
When you feel
you are threatened?

01:14:25.624 --> 01:14:27.511
Yeah, you could say that.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:34.415
With these,
no one can get to you.

01:14:35.063 --> 01:14:37.648
They'll stop just about anyone.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.693
From Jamie Cory's clothing.

01:16:32.748 --> 01:16:35.115
We traced the serial numbers.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.184
It is...

01:16:38.475 --> 01:16:43.428
It's payroll money Louisiana Bank sent
to 2401 Tulane Avenue.

01:16:43.595 --> 01:16:46.944
Even if the killer saw her earlier,
who's to say he gave her the money?

01:16:47.114 --> 01:16:48.870
It could've been some drunk.

01:16:49.034 --> 01:16:53.790
Luther said he found minute glass fragments
on them, just like the fragments on the doll.

01:16:53.962 --> 01:16:58.118
He also found a barley residue he says
resembles the smudge marks on the carpet.

01:16:59.689 --> 01:17:01.216
Barley?

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:06.854
- What's at 2401 Tulane?
- Dixie Brewery.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.512
- How many employees?
- Almost 1000.

01:19:16.476 --> 01:19:19.476
- All of them have medical files?
- Sure.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:23.800
Well, start checking the blood type o's,
and then we'll work our way from there.

01:19:23.964 --> 01:19:26.931
Isn't it possible she could have
got them from someone else?

01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:29.008
No.

01:19:32.763 --> 01:19:34.257
Amanda's kitchen.

01:19:34.427 --> 01:19:37.623
- Hi. What's doing?
- Dinner.

01:19:37.786 --> 01:19:39.761
Sorry, I won't be there.
I've gotta work late.

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:42.003
<i>You save some for me.</i>

01:19:46.202 --> 01:19:48.471
There'll be plenty.
Don't worry.

01:19:48.793 --> 01:19:52.916
Tell Mrs. Holstein to lock up.
You look after your sister, will you?

01:19:53.849 --> 01:19:55.507
Got you, Dad.

01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:57.424
Bye.

01:20:00.664 --> 01:20:03.151
You'd like another car
to check on them?

01:20:04.951 --> 01:20:06.380
Yeah.

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:13.830
Ruth?

01:21:17.169 --> 01:21:19.023
Mrs. Holstein?

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.578
Mrs. Holstein?

01:21:54.445 --> 01:21:56.233
- Penny.
- Daddy.

01:21:56.397 --> 01:21:57.924
Wake up.

01:21:58.669 --> 01:22:03.044
I want you to get in the closet. Don't
come out until your dad says so, okay?

01:23:03.398 --> 01:23:05.308
Stay right there.

01:25:22.137 --> 01:25:24.046
Daddy.

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.423
It's all right.

01:25:44.151 --> 01:25:46.060
She's ready, Wes.

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:51.728
We checked everywhere,
no sign of him.

01:25:58.518 --> 01:25:59.925
- Joe?
- Yeah.

01:26:00.086 --> 01:26:02.474
- Was she...?
- No, no, no.

01:26:27.955 --> 01:26:30.191
<i>Squad 15, how do you read?</i>

01:26:30.355 --> 01:26:32.395
<i>Squad 15. You're loud and clear.</i>

01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:40.397
<i>Car 32, 17-50.</i>

01:28:35.622 --> 01:28:37.695
You...

01:28:56.132 --> 01:28:58.303
I'll get you, motherfucker.

01:28:58.468 --> 01:29:01.567
Then I'm going to break
your motherfucking head!

01:29:21.698 --> 01:29:23.356
We talked a bit.

01:29:23.522 --> 01:29:25.377
She felt better.

01:29:26.178 --> 01:29:28.512
She'll be able to rest now.

01:29:35.841 --> 01:29:38.229
It wasn't your fault.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.717
No one could have known
what he'd do.

01:29:53.887 --> 01:29:55.959
No one but me.

01:30:34.267 --> 01:30:38.042
There are 255 male Caucasians
with blood type o at Dixie.

01:30:38.203 --> 01:30:41.519
Fifty of them were working
the night shift during the murders.

01:30:41.691 --> 01:30:44.211
Check and see if any
of the others have records.

01:30:44.379 --> 01:30:47.095
And check the hair colors
of those samples...

01:30:47.258 --> 01:30:50.771
...that we've got, would you?
And the dental records along with...

01:30:56.089 --> 01:31:00.464
- Ask their personnel about a Leander Rolfe.
- Leander Rolfe?

01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:12.020
How is she today?

01:31:12.184 --> 01:31:13.493
Better.

01:31:13.655 --> 01:31:17.365
- Penny would like to spend the night.
- That's all right.

01:31:17.528 --> 01:31:19.632
You wait out here, sweetie.

01:31:56.692 --> 01:31:59.026
My mother used to wear this.

01:32:01.043 --> 01:32:03.246
Maybe you'd like to wear it too.

01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:47.054
Telephone.

01:32:57.998 --> 01:32:59.939
- Yeah?
- Bingo.

01:33:25.835 --> 01:33:29.315
Leander Rolfe just finished doing 11 years
at Angola State Prison...

01:33:29.483 --> 01:33:32.385
...for going nuts one night...
- And raping two teenagers.

01:33:32.554 --> 01:33:34.529
You remember him?

01:33:34.699 --> 01:33:36.771
Yeah. He was a cop.

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:39.171
You knew him?

01:33:40.234 --> 01:33:41.728
I arrested him.

01:33:42.986 --> 01:33:45.407
He just left Dixie Brewery
a half-hour ago.

01:33:45.961 --> 01:33:47.717
- What room is he in?
- 316.

01:33:47.881 --> 01:33:49.375
Let's go.

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.780
You try in there.

01:35:27.264 --> 01:35:31.289
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I could've just blown my stack.

01:36:09.051 --> 01:36:10.676
How long has it been?

01:36:11.035 --> 01:36:12.758
About an hour.

01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:15.098
Do you think he saw us?

01:36:16.219 --> 01:36:18.161
I don't know. Maybe.

01:36:57.623 --> 01:36:58.571
<i>Jake?</i>

01:36:58.743 --> 01:37:01.012
I just called
and no one answers.

01:37:01.398 --> 01:37:05.195
Well, she's in there,
and so is Restic.

01:37:06.678 --> 01:37:08.401
Vic, anything?

01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.619
Vic?

01:37:14.933 --> 01:37:16.755
Jake, Vic's not answering.

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.034
Jake?

01:37:22.132 --> 01:37:23.659
Jake?

01:39:57.829 --> 01:39:59.771
I'm okay.

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.831
Get inside, will you, Joe?

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.187
You all right, Wes?
