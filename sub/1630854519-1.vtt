00:08.252 --> 00:11.312
<i>Alright, sit down, shut up.</i>

00:11.412 --> 00:13.792
<i>Are you ready? Good.</i>

00:13.892 --> 00:16.172
<i>'Cause I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>a story.</i>

00:18.253 --> 00:20.913
<i>It's a modern-day</i>
<i>Christmas epic,</i>

00:21.013 --> 00:23.553
<i>a tale of saviours and scrooges,</i>

00:23.653 --> 00:25.153
<i>family and friends,</i>

00:25.253 --> 00:26.753
<i>heroes and villains</i>

00:26.853 --> 00:28.993
<i>and of Harrington & Sons,</i>

00:29.093 --> 00:31.593
<i>the greatest toy store</i>
<i>in the whole wide world.</i>

00:34.654 --> 00:37.054
<i>Or at least</i>
<i>the greater metropolitan region.</i>

00:38.414 --> 00:41.634
<i>Harrington & Sons was</i>
<i>a magical wonderland,</i>

00:41.734 --> 00:44.734
<i>a toy store that kids</i>
<i>never wanted to leave.</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:52.555
<i>This was a toy store</i>

00:52.655 --> 00:54.155
<i>that was chockablock full</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:56.035
<i>of the best toys ever.</i>

00:56.135 --> 00:59.355
<i>It had steam trains, puppy dogs</i>

00:59.455 --> 01:02.315
<i>and the famous</i>
<i>Harringtons ball pit.</i>

01:02.415 --> 01:04.436
<i>Everything was special,</i>

01:04.536 --> 01:06.756
<i>even that weird</i>
<i>toy soldier thing.</i>

01:13.536 --> 01:15.356
<i>This fine establishment</i>

01:15.456 --> 01:18.516
<i>was owned by a man named</i>
<i>Clarence Harrington,</i>

01:18.616 --> 01:21.037
<i>a real-life Santa Claus.</i>

01:21.137 --> 01:24.117
<i>Clarence was beloved by</i>
<i>every kid who knew him</i>

01:24.217 --> 01:26.677
<i>and people came</i>
<i>from far and wide to meet him</i>

01:26.777 --> 01:28.917
<i>and share in</i>
<i>his Christmas spirit.</i>

01:29.017 --> 01:29.917
<i>He was a good bloke.</i>

01:30.017 --> 01:31.317
Hi, Mr Harrington.

01:31.417 --> 01:34.597
<i>He was the father</i>
<i>of Derrick and Terri,</i>

01:34.697 --> 01:37.938
<i>who both loved the store</i>
<i>with all their hearts.</i>

01:39.418 --> 01:41.678
<i>Derrick wanted to grow up</i>
<i>just like his dad</i>

01:41.778 --> 01:45.078
<i>and run the toy shop</i>
<i>exactly the way he did</i>

01:45.178 --> 01:48.118
<i>and, of course, keep up</i>
<i>their Christmas tradition</i>

01:48.218 --> 01:49.718
<i>of sending letters to Santa</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:52.259
<i>in the pouch of</i>
<i>their giant kangaroo.</i>

01:57.859 --> 02:00.799
<i>Sadly, all this joy</i>
<i>was not to last,</i>

02:00.899 --> 02:04.719
<i>for time has a funny way</i>
<i>of changing things.</i>

02:04.819 --> 02:08.520
<i>But this story actually starts</i>
<i>with a much older Derrick</i>

02:08.620 --> 02:13.360
<i>and Gladys, the best</i>
<i>security guard in the universe.</i>

02:13.460 --> 02:16.200
Careful. She's about to pop.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.120
Gladys, what are you doing here?
I sent you home an hour ago.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.880
Clearly I'm still needed.
Hold this.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.981
I got it.

02:25.421 --> 02:26.601
Greg-Nog?

02:26.701 --> 02:30.441
Another gift from Greg.
By far, the worst.

02:30.541 --> 02:31.641
Hoo.

02:31.741 --> 02:33.881
You still haven't told him?

02:33.981 --> 02:35.981
Told him what, Derrick?

02:36.821 --> 02:38.521
As my employer,

02:38.621 --> 02:41.042
the status of my love-life is
actually none of your business.

02:41.142 --> 02:44.842
-And what about as a friend?
-Mm, would we say we're friends?

02:44.942 --> 02:46.942
How many letters for Santa
have you got?

02:48.662 --> 02:50.282
-Jeez, that's bleak.
-Yeah.

02:50.382 --> 02:52.802
Well, why write to Santa
when you can text him?

02:52.902 --> 02:55.602
Well, with less ballast, maybe
this'll take off this year.

02:55.702 --> 02:57.703
Yeah.

02:58.783 --> 02:59.923
Are you OK?

03:00.023 --> 03:02.963
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

03:03.063 --> 03:05.643
I know Christmas by yourself
can be tough,

03:05.743 --> 03:07.743
especially when
you've done it so many times.

03:08.743 --> 03:12.844
How about I let you win
at giant Jenga?

03:12.944 --> 03:17.684
-Go home, Gladys.
-Alright.

03:17.784 --> 03:19.684
Just let me do
one more sweep of the floor.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.284
Now.

03:21.384 --> 03:23.164
And for Pete's sake,
talk to him!

03:23.264 --> 03:25.884
-Mm.
-You forgot your Greg-Nog.

03:25.984 --> 03:27.284
Keep it.

03:27.384 --> 03:31.285
-Merry Christmas, Gladys.
-Merry Christmas, Derrick.

03:51.546 --> 03:53.246
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>Christmas shoppers.</i>

03:53.346 --> 03:56.046
<i>Just a reminder Harrington &</i>
<i>Sons is closing in 10 minutes,</i>

03:56.146 --> 03:58.166
<i>so feel free to queue up</i>
<i>at the registers now</i>

03:58.266 --> 03:59.847
<i>and beat the Christmas rush.</i>

04:05.147 --> 04:06.407
Cute!

04:06.507 --> 04:10.247
Can we keep him, Mum? Please?

04:10.347 --> 04:12.627
He's not that expensive.

04:14.227 --> 04:17.688
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe
find something a little smaller.

04:17.788 --> 04:19.528
You know, this one
was just telling me

04:19.628 --> 04:20.928
how much he wanted a good home.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.528
Do you promise to walk him
every day?

04:22.628 --> 04:23.568
I promise!

04:23.668 --> 04:24.768
Then he's all yours.

04:24.868 --> 04:28.448
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, it's nothing.

04:28.548 --> 04:30.788
And, look,
you can't break up the litter.

04:32.029 --> 04:33.889
How about your take
his little sister too, hey?

04:33.989 --> 04:36.129
Are you sure?

04:36.229 --> 04:39.489
Yeah, it's my pleasure.
Merry Christmas.

04:39.589 --> 04:41.649
Merry Christmas.

04:46.029 --> 04:47.129
Where are your video games?

04:47.229 --> 04:49.570
Oh, sorry, mate.

04:49.670 --> 04:53.030
We don't actually stock
those here, but...

04:54.990 --> 04:56.090
..have you seen this?

04:56.190 --> 04:58.170
Of course I have.

04:58.270 --> 05:00.750
Well, just wait for it.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.731
Wait for it.

05:06.991 --> 05:09.691
Yeah, look, I just came here
for video games.

05:09.791 --> 05:13.151
Wait for it. Wait for it.

05:16.071 --> 05:19.031
Holy dooley!

05:20.432 --> 05:23.052
This place sucks,
by the way.

05:23.152 --> 05:25.152
Holy dooley.

05:31.312 --> 05:32.892
-Pete!
-Hi.

05:32.992 --> 05:34.772
-Is everything OK?
-Uh, yeah.

05:34.872 --> 05:36.093
-Well, no.
-Ooh!

05:36.193 --> 05:37.853
Someone graffitied all
the Magna Sketches again.

05:37.953 --> 05:40.713
-Yeah, that is very lifelike.
-I know.

05:42.833 --> 05:45.253
I reckon that's us done
for the day, mate.

05:45.353 --> 05:47.693
-I'll close up.
-No, I'll do it.

05:47.793 --> 05:49.813
-I always do it.
-Nah, don't be silly.

05:49.913 --> 05:52.534
-It's Christmas Eve.
-I do still need to find Jesus.

05:52.634 --> 05:56.054
As in 'baby', for the nativity.

05:56.154 --> 05:57.774
At least a substitution.
I could probably...

05:57.874 --> 05:59.494
Ooh!

05:59.594 --> 06:01.174
Good grief. Sorry!

06:01.274 --> 06:03.654
Playlist mix-up.

06:04.994 --> 06:07.855
-Go home to your family, Pete.
-Yeah,

06:07.955 --> 06:10.975
-OK. On.
-I really don't think that's...

06:11.075 --> 06:12.535
Attention, valued customers.

06:12.635 --> 06:14.375
This is Pete
from the front desk.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.015
Harrington & Sons is now closed.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.495
Thank you very much.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.295
There we go. Just in case.

06:20.395 --> 06:21.615
Alright.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.936
Well, merry Christmas,
Mr Harrington.

06:24.036 --> 06:26.496
I'll see you Boxing Day.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.596
Merry Christmas, Pete.

06:55.277 --> 06:57.218
"Thanks, Gregory.

06:57.318 --> 06:58.738
"Also, LOL,

06:58.838 --> 07:02.318
"I forgot to say
I'm...pregnant."

07:10.758 --> 07:13.099
Don't be stupid.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.340
Wombat, confirm
you have eyes on the target.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.860
OK, but I think
we should just wait

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
until they turn the lights
back on.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.580
Oh, my gosh...

07:35.680 --> 07:37.680
Oh, bingo!

07:38.920 --> 07:40.980
Commence
Operation Christmas Star.

07:57.241 --> 07:59.381
Left. Left.

07:59.481 --> 08:02.382
No, <i>your</i> left!

08:02.482 --> 08:03.862
We have the same left.

08:03.962 --> 08:06.162
Oh, right.

08:07.522 --> 08:09.502
Right.

08:09.602 --> 08:11.182
Little more.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.282
A little more.

08:27.283 --> 08:29.923
What have we got here?

08:31.123 --> 08:33.804
Merry Christmas, Gladys.

08:35.884 --> 08:37.104
Yes!

08:43.764 --> 08:45.464
Wombat, look!

08:45.564 --> 08:48.185
I know! It's beautiful!

08:48.285 --> 08:51.365
No. Behind you.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.265
Waah!

08:53.365 --> 08:55.505
Well, well, well,

08:55.605 --> 08:56.945
if it isn't Barbie

08:57.045 --> 08:58.145
and Ken.

08:58.245 --> 09:00.105
-Don't call me Ken!
-I didn't.

09:00.205 --> 09:02.485
Run!

09:03.526 --> 09:07.446
-Brady, save yourself!
-Never leave a man behind.

09:10.446 --> 09:11.426
<i>Attack.</i>

09:16.166 --> 09:17.786
Hey! Urgh!

09:17.886 --> 09:20.867
Get back here,
you little skid marks!

09:23.007 --> 09:25.007
Think quick!

09:25.967 --> 09:27.967
She's like
a pregnant Terminator!

09:28.767 --> 09:30.887
Get back here!

09:32.967 --> 09:34.147
She's unstoppable!

09:34.247 --> 09:36.148
She has the power of two humans!

09:36.248 --> 09:38.228
Run!

09:38.328 --> 09:40.188
-Uh-oh!
-Don't you dare!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.868
I'm sorry.

09:46.328 --> 09:49.528
This is it. This is the end.

09:55.689 --> 09:58.549
Next station, my office.

10:00.569 --> 10:02.649
What did you eat?!

10:04.729 --> 10:07.270
Don't forget, Wombat,
we're pleading the Fifth.

10:07.370 --> 10:09.370
Right.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.310
The fifth what?

10:11.410 --> 10:14.370
Don't say a word.

10:18.450 --> 10:23.271
So, you thought you could fool
old Gladys, huh?

10:23.371 --> 10:25.651
I expected more from you.

10:26.691 --> 10:28.691
Maybe not from you.

10:29.131 --> 10:32.071
Please, drink.

10:32.171 --> 10:34.171
You must be thirsty.

10:36.691 --> 10:40.552
You sure, mate?
Could be a long night.

10:42.692 --> 10:44.632
Have it your way, then.

10:52.012 --> 10:52.912
Ahhh!

10:55.973 --> 10:58.113
Tell me your names now!

10:58.213 --> 11:00.233
-Wombat!
-No. Wombat!

11:00.333 --> 11:02.373
-Sorry, Brady!
-Stop!

11:03.453 --> 11:06.113
I've been after you two
for a very long time,

11:06.213 --> 11:07.873
Wombat and Brady.

11:07.973 --> 11:12.374
No-one steals from Mr Harrington
on my watch.

11:15.134 --> 11:16.954
December 1,

11:17.054 --> 11:21.154
you started off small,
the Good Night Night Light.

11:21.254 --> 11:25.674
December 2,
Outback Olive Sleeping Bag.

11:25.774 --> 11:27.875
Very cosy.

11:27.975 --> 11:31.835
Then, December 15,
for some inexplicable reason,

11:31.935 --> 11:33.995
you steal my lunch
from the office microwave.

11:34.095 --> 11:36.635
-That wasn't us.
-We don't even like risotto.

11:36.735 --> 11:38.115
Who said anything about risotto?

11:38.215 --> 11:40.315
These were all taken
inside the store.

11:40.415 --> 11:42.775
It's not stealing
if it doesn't leave the store.

12:32.979 --> 12:35.959
Enough with the whistling, Shez.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.560
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.660
We're actually closed
for the evening.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.400
But we're open again Boxing Day.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.680
All Christmas trees 50% off.

12:56.780 --> 12:58.780
Hello, Derrick.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.700
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

13:06.661 --> 13:08.161
Hey, Mr Harrington,
I didn't find baby Jesus,

13:08.261 --> 13:10.441
but I did find
a little poopy baby doll.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.101
Pete, get out of here.

13:18.661 --> 13:20.662
Where do you think you're going?

13:24.742 --> 13:26.242
-Where's your mum?
-Dunno.

13:26.342 --> 13:28.242
-Alright. Your dad?
-Dunno.

13:28.342 --> 13:29.682
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

13:29.782 --> 13:31.842
No, but it looks like your baby
should have been.

13:34.622 --> 13:36.623
What baby?

13:36.983 --> 13:41.003
I know kids like you.
I've known them all my life.

13:41.103 --> 13:45.083
Selfish, mean,
sticky little bullies

13:45.183 --> 13:47.183
who get away with everything.

13:48.263 --> 13:50.623
Well, not today.

13:53.904 --> 13:55.764
Who are they?

13:55.864 --> 13:57.864
What time is it?

13:58.584 --> 14:00.724
-7:00.
-Give me that!

14:00.824 --> 14:02.844
What haven't you stolen?!

14:02.944 --> 14:06.244
Alright, you two stay here and
think about what you've done.

14:06.344 --> 14:08.365
Oh, we will.

14:08.465 --> 14:09.965
Hey!

14:10.065 --> 14:12.065
Aw!

14:17.505 --> 14:19.285
Hey, you know...you know,
you know, whatever it is...

14:19.385 --> 14:21.325
Whatever it is, you know,
crime is not the answer.

14:21.425 --> 14:25.206
Is it money? If it's money,
then we are hiring.

14:25.306 --> 14:27.306
We're clear.

14:39.507 --> 14:41.587
What are you looking at?

14:44.787 --> 14:48.247
What are you looking at?

14:48.347 --> 14:50.487
An angel.

14:50.587 --> 14:52.207
What are you lookin' at?

14:52.307 --> 14:53.367
Sorry. So...

14:53.467 --> 14:55.368
You got a bloody lift here
or what?

14:55.468 --> 14:57.848
- No.
- Should be criminal.

14:57.948 --> 15:00.208
-Let him go.
-It's too late for that.

15:00.308 --> 15:02.328
He's just a kid. Please.

15:02.428 --> 15:05.128
We let him go, first thing
he's gonna do is call the cops.

15:05.228 --> 15:07.228
No, he won't. Will you, Pete?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.408
No?

15:09.508 --> 15:11.249
Real believable.

15:11.349 --> 15:15.009
Nothing to be scared of
as long as you do what we say.

15:15.109 --> 15:16.449
Now sit down.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.489
-Hey...
-I said sit down!

15:20.589 --> 15:21.969
Just do what they say, Pete.

15:22.069 --> 15:24.409
Look, look, I know...
I know the holidays are hard.

15:24.509 --> 15:26.369
You'll be hard
if you don't sit down.

15:26.469 --> 15:28.470
What?

15:29.350 --> 15:31.350
You know what I mean!

15:32.470 --> 15:34.470
What?

15:35.030 --> 15:36.690
Don't. No, don't... Ooh!

15:36.790 --> 15:38.790
Oh! Hey!

15:39.630 --> 15:41.690
You got a problem, Harrington?

15:41.790 --> 15:43.791
No.

15:44.631 --> 15:46.631
No problem.

15:47.111 --> 15:49.091
Get up.

15:49.191 --> 15:51.051
They're gonna throw us
in the slammer, Brady!

15:51.151 --> 15:54.151
That's the least of our worries
if we don't get out of here.

15:56.591 --> 15:58.591
Get rid of the photos.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.452
That is so smart!

16:09.552 --> 16:11.572
Way cooler than using
the spare key.

16:12.992 --> 16:15.973
-What?
-The one hanging on the wall.

16:16.073 --> 16:18.073
Oh, my...

16:25.153 --> 16:26.293
Just a double knot?

16:26.393 --> 16:28.393
We're not
tying shoelaces, Sherrin!

16:29.393 --> 16:30.654
What kind of knot is that?

16:36.594 --> 16:37.694
Whoa!

16:47.635 --> 16:49.655
Alright, alright,
keep your knickers on.

16:49.755 --> 16:51.535
My knickers
are in a knot.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.635
Oh.

16:54.075 --> 16:56.375
-You OK, Pete?
-Yep.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.855
Alright, fine. What do you want?

16:59.955 --> 17:02.415
300,000 in cash.

17:02.515 --> 17:05.656
I'm sorry.
We don't have that much.

17:05.756 --> 17:08.836
Oh, I'm sure Mr Harrington
will think of something.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.576
"All Hail the Gaming Queen"?

17:12.676 --> 17:14.456
I'm sorry, who is...
Who is... Who is that?

17:14.556 --> 17:16.456
-That's my sister.
-It's your sister?

17:16.556 --> 17:19.257
Your sister owns
Territron Games?

17:19.357 --> 17:21.457
Oh, my God, Mr Harrington!

17:21.557 --> 17:23.697
I own literally every single one
of her video games.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.797
-Shut it!
-Wh...

17:26.517 --> 17:28.097
Where's your phone?

17:28.197 --> 17:31.897
Hurry up, dimples! You
waste our time, I waste you!

17:33.397 --> 17:34.538
Crap!

17:37.078 --> 17:39.078
Where's my phone?!

17:39.918 --> 17:41.918
Crap!

17:45.358 --> 17:47.358
Crap.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.958
- Oh!
- Head to the roof!

17:51.079 --> 17:53.019
Oi!

17:53.119 --> 17:55.539
<i>- Mama! I need a new nappy!</i>
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!

17:55.639 --> 17:58.959
- Stop it! Stop it.
<i>- Mama! I need a new nappy!</i>

18:02.879 --> 18:04.879
Hey! Get back here!

18:05.879 --> 18:07.580
Wait.
Where did they go?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.420
Did you check upstairs?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.900
You gotta be kidding me.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.220
Of course
I checked upstairs.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.660
- Well, what's with the noises?
- Stop nagging.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.760
I know what I'm doing.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.341
Nan, oh, my God,

18:23.441 --> 18:26.481
can you just shut it
for once in your life?

18:33.601 --> 18:36.261
<i>Mama!</i>
<i>There was tomato in that.</i>

18:36.361 --> 18:38.382
<i>Now my lips are tingly.</i>

18:38.482 --> 18:39.942
What is that?

18:40.042 --> 18:42.382
<i>Don't forget,</i>
<i>I'm gluten-intolerant,</i>

18:42.482 --> 18:45.342
<i>peanut-intolerant,</i>
<i>lactose-intolerant!</i>

18:45.442 --> 18:47.262
They used to
just shit themselves.

18:49.802 --> 18:52.402
<i>I need to poop again.</i>

18:53.402 --> 18:55.403
- Is everything OK?
- It's fine.

18:56.363 --> 18:58.363
Let's make the call.

19:02.243 --> 19:03.623
She'll never fit in here.

19:03.723 --> 19:05.543
Who are you guys talking about?

19:05.643 --> 19:07.143
The fat security gu...

19:07.243 --> 19:09.303
We don't want him to faint.

19:09.403 --> 19:11.264
I said we need them
for this job.

19:11.364 --> 19:12.264
Alright!

19:14.084 --> 19:17.544
I'm not trying to bust ya,
but we are in serious danger,

19:17.644 --> 19:18.944
Look.

19:19.044 --> 19:21.384
Stop it!
You don't need to talk to him!

19:21.484 --> 19:23.424
- He's scared.
- He's fine!

19:23.524 --> 19:24.824
It's ringing.

19:39.725 --> 19:42.386
She's, um, not answering.

19:42.486 --> 19:44.226
Well,
why isn't she answering?

19:44.326 --> 19:45.586
I don't know, OK?

19:45.686 --> 19:48.626
- That's ridiculous!
- It's been a while.

19:48.726 --> 19:49.986
What do we do?

19:50.086 --> 19:53.626
Keep your grubby mouth shut
and follow me.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.106
Where do we go?

19:59.727 --> 20:01.427
It's Christmas Eve.
She's probably...

20:01.527 --> 20:03.267
<i>Hello. Terri speaking.</i>

20:03.367 --> 20:04.667
Terri!

20:04.767 --> 20:06.127
-Goodnight. Merry Christmas.
-See you. Merry Christmas.

20:06.207 --> 20:07.987
Hi. Sorry. Who is this?

20:08.087 --> 20:09.507
<i>It's Derrick.</i>

20:09.607 --> 20:11.987
<i>Derrick...?</i>

20:12.087 --> 20:13.467
Y-your brother.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.708
Oh! Right.

20:15.808 --> 20:18.248
Um, sorry. New phone.

20:20.248 --> 20:23.428
Well, thanks for answering,
I...I guess.

20:23.528 --> 20:25.968
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's a Christmas miracle.</i>

20:31.689 --> 20:33.309
OK, well, great chat.

20:33.409 --> 20:34.949
Give me that!

20:36.769 --> 20:40.009
Teresa Harrington,
we have your brother hostage.

20:41.009 --> 20:46.390
And you've got one hour
to give us $300,000 or else.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.470
I don't know what you're trying
to pull, Derrick,

20:48.570 --> 20:50.510
but this isn't funny.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.070
No, they're serious, Terri.

20:52.170 --> 20:54.310
They came into our
store. They've got us here.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.550
They...they came in with guns.

20:55.650 --> 20:58.190
Oh, my God, OK.
Well, I'll call the police.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.350
You call the cops and you'll
never see your brother again.

21:01.450 --> 21:03.451
They want money.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.331
I need your help, Terri.

21:09.891 --> 21:13.451
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah, yeah, I did.

21:15.091 --> 21:17.271
Listen up, C-E-ho,

21:17.371 --> 21:21.812
we want 300K in one hour
or we start playing hangman.

21:23.012 --> 21:24.192
I already said that.

21:24.292 --> 21:26.552
It's not what you say, Shez,
it's how you say it.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.032
You gotta scare 'em and hang up.

21:28.132 --> 21:30.432
Then they call back
all crying and blubbering

21:30.532 --> 21:33.172
and begging to do
whatever it is you want.

21:55.054 --> 21:57.054
Uh-oh.

21:57.574 --> 21:58.794
What? What's the matter?

21:58.894 --> 22:02.474
Oh, no! Wombat, don't you dare!

22:02.574 --> 22:04.674
-I can't help it!
-Can't help what?

22:04.774 --> 22:07.035
-Hold it in!
-It's coming!

22:07.135 --> 22:08.155
What's the matter?

22:08.255 --> 22:11.115
When Wombat gets nervous, he...

22:28.176 --> 22:29.116
What the hell was that?

22:31.496 --> 22:33.776
It wasn't that bad.

22:35.736 --> 22:38.437
Christ, that's rank!

22:38.537 --> 22:41.917
Oh, oh, it's the mice.

22:42.017 --> 22:44.757
We have big mice in our store.

22:44.857 --> 22:46.197
We don't have mice.

22:46.297 --> 22:47.757
Yes, we do. We do.

22:47.857 --> 22:49.357
Remember I left
the invoice on your desk

22:49.457 --> 22:50.917
for the mouse traps?

22:51.017 --> 22:53.077
Wasn't that for the board game?

22:53.177 --> 22:54.358
No.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.718
Jesus, Pete, you bought
200 actual mouse traps?

22:56.818 --> 23:01.878
Doesn't smell like mice.
Smells like rats.

23:01.978 --> 23:04.278
-She's coming in!
-Where do we go?

23:04.378 --> 23:06.438
Bloody big rats.

23:06.538 --> 23:07.838
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Uh...

23:07.938 --> 23:10.239
-What do we do?!
-Be quiet!

23:10.339 --> 23:12.319
Shh, shh! Just follow me.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.120
Pete, what are you doing?

23:27.220 --> 23:29.560
Oh, come on! Having a bit
of fun. You know the words.

23:37.660 --> 23:40.220
I think they've broken him.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.641
It's a diversion. Let's go!

24:06.982 --> 24:08.982
Uh...

24:15.463 --> 24:18.443
You try that again,
I'll cut your jingle balls off.

24:18.543 --> 24:20.483
At least he'd hit
the high notes.

24:23.743 --> 24:26.043
Right,
Tweedledee and Tweedlebum,

24:26.143 --> 24:27.643
it's time to get you
out of here.

24:27.743 --> 24:29.964
-What? No way!
-Yes way!

24:30.064 --> 24:32.684
It's too dangerous and you two
are gonna cause trouble.

24:32.784 --> 24:33.844
What about Pete?

24:33.944 --> 24:35.724
Pete? Why do you care about him?

24:35.824 --> 24:37.204
He...

24:37.304 --> 24:38.484
..seems to be a nice guy.

24:38.584 --> 24:40.644
Well, I guess nice guys
do finish last. Let's go!

24:40.744 --> 24:43.524
-Pete's our brother!
-Wombat, stop!

24:43.624 --> 24:45.524
Employee-of-the-month Pete?

24:45.624 --> 24:46.725
He's your brother?!

24:46.825 --> 24:48.685
And you never leave
a man behind.

24:50.145 --> 24:52.565
Well, we can't stay here.
Come on.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.125
-Snitch!
-What? You don't!

24:55.225 --> 24:57.605
You don't feed them
to the sharks either.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.045
Shut up! Let's go!

24:59.145 --> 25:00.885
Mr Harrington
doesn't have any sharks.

25:00.985 --> 25:02.846
Shh!

25:11.946 --> 25:13.606
-Mr Harrington...
-Hmm?

25:13.706 --> 25:15.446
..there is something
that I need to tell you.

25:15.546 --> 25:17.967
-Hmm?
-The... My...

25:18.067 --> 25:20.067
So, why hasn't your sister
rung back?

25:21.307 --> 25:23.647
It's been 10 minutes, yeah?
Just give her time.

25:23.747 --> 25:25.847
She was probably just in shock.

25:25.947 --> 25:29.687
I'm no therapist,
but in a ransom,

25:29.787 --> 25:32.567
family members
generally tend to -

25:32.667 --> 25:34.528
I don't know -

25:34.628 --> 25:35.608
care?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.988
I'm telling you it was shock.

25:39.948 --> 25:42.408
Thought you said
this was a done deal, Shez.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.168
I've got this. Trust me.

25:44.268 --> 25:45.968
-Done that once before.
-Nan!

25:46.068 --> 25:47.808
Or have you forgotten
Smith Street?

25:47.908 --> 25:50.929
-I said I've got this!
-Yeah?

25:51.029 --> 25:54.409
'Cause it's looking
a bit like a shitshow, Shez.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.249
Maybe you need to call
for some backup.

25:56.349 --> 26:00.129
We just don't talk much, yeah,
since our dad died.

26:00.229 --> 26:03.009
It's just a little rough patch
we're going through.

26:03.109 --> 26:05.109
Your dad died 10 years ago.

26:05.590 --> 26:08.690
You haven't spoken to her
in 10 years?!

26:08.790 --> 26:11.530
She will call back, OK?
You'll get your money.

26:11.630 --> 26:12.770
Can we all just calm down?

26:12.870 --> 26:15.610
Oh, we're all calm here,
Derrick.

26:15.710 --> 26:17.710
For now.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.891
Hey, Mr Harrington,
what if your...

26:21.991 --> 26:24.491
What if you sister
doesn't help us?

26:24.591 --> 26:26.531
She will.

26:26.631 --> 26:28.211
-She will.
-OK, she will.

26:28.311 --> 26:29.931
Then why hasn't she called back?

26:30.031 --> 26:32.751
Pete, drop it.

26:34.231 --> 26:36.231
I'm sorry.

26:38.832 --> 26:41.352
You know, I know how hard
it can be to lose family.

26:43.832 --> 26:45.832
Yeah, it is.

26:47.352 --> 26:49.092
Mr Harrington, there's something
that I'm gonna tell you

26:49.192 --> 26:51.192
about the mice in the tunnel.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.853
Got about 50 more of them
over there

26:54.953 --> 26:56.953
if you don't shut up.

27:05.393 --> 27:06.533
What are you doing?

27:06.633 --> 27:08.693
Calling the cops,
but it's not going through.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.134
No cops! They'll kill Pete!

27:10.234 --> 27:14.294
OK, traps shut. I think
they've cut off the phone lines.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.394
Where's my phone?!

27:18.594 --> 27:20.694
-It's low.
-Thanks for that, Einstein.

27:20.794 --> 27:22.014
I got that.

27:24.714 --> 27:26.135
Is it happening?

27:26.235 --> 27:27.255
Or Braxton Hicks?

27:27.355 --> 27:30.095
Nothing's happening! Get off!

27:31.195 --> 27:32.575
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

27:32.675 --> 27:34.675
What?

27:35.075 --> 27:37.075
I know who to call.

27:41.796 --> 27:43.796
Oh! Oh, wait.

27:45.036 --> 27:46.496
Who is it? Gladys?

27:46.596 --> 27:47.616
Mate!

27:47.716 --> 27:49.416
You can't let her
do this to you.

27:49.516 --> 27:51.096
Gotta use this
if you wanna protect this.

27:51.196 --> 27:53.856
No, no, she's just calling to
say thank you for the Greg-Nog.

27:53.956 --> 27:55.456
-Gregory, you didn't.
-I did.

27:55.556 --> 27:57.817
It was small and it's for
the 12 days of Christmas.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.337
Oh! Mate!

27:59.437 --> 28:01.137
-No, no, no, no!
-I'm putting my foot down.

28:01.237 --> 28:03.097
-Hey!
-You guys dated for how long?

28:03.197 --> 28:04.337
OK, it was about a year.

28:04.437 --> 28:06.937
-And she broke up with you when?
-Nine months ago.

28:07.037 --> 28:09.037
And when you asked her why,
she...

28:10.797 --> 28:12.457
She vomited on the pavement,
ran away

28:12.557 --> 28:13.898
and then ghosted me ever since.

28:13.998 --> 28:15.538
Exactly.

28:15.638 --> 28:19.258
Nine months. Vomiting.
Uncharacteristic mood swings.

28:19.358 --> 28:20.458
It's not gonna take a genius

28:20.558 --> 28:22.558
to figure out what's
going on here, Greg.

28:23.238 --> 28:24.938
She's a player.

28:26.398 --> 28:29.419
And if you pick up this phone,
you're gonna get played.

28:29.519 --> 28:31.259
But I thought she was the one.

28:34.199 --> 28:36.219
Greg, you're one of the best
blokes that I know,

28:36.319 --> 28:38.859
and one day, you're gonna
make someone very happy.

28:38.959 --> 28:40.659
But until then,

28:40.759 --> 28:42.759
we've got lives to save.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.140
Yeah, you're right. Thanks, Sam.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.660
You're right. Thanks, man.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.660
Alright, firies, we ready?
We good? Let's bring it in.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.460
Yeah, nice. Less shirts,
more skin.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.100
You lot are gonna make
the front cover

28:57.200 --> 28:58.340
of the Christmas calendar.

28:58.440 --> 29:01.100
Mwah!
You put the 'fire' in 'fireman'.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.661
Good. Great, yep.
Oh, that's hot.

29:03.761 --> 29:06.581
This is so hot
I'm gonna have to put you out.

29:06.681 --> 29:07.941
OK, great. That's great.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.981
That's... Something's missing.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.081
-Puppies are ready.
-Oh, yeah. Get 'em in there.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.341
He's rejected me!

29:14.441 --> 29:15.781
Try again!

29:15.881 --> 29:17.342
He's never rejected me before.

29:17.442 --> 29:19.422
Maybe he's busy saving lives.

29:19.522 --> 29:20.902
The puppies are babies.
You've saved them.

29:21.002 --> 29:23.002
You're handing them
back to their mother.

29:25.082 --> 29:28.282
This is September, you know?
Yeah, nice.

29:31.362 --> 29:33.983
- Crap, it died!
- What do we do now?

29:34.083 --> 29:35.943
We could...

29:36.043 --> 29:37.663
..fly a drone outside
with a message?

29:37.763 --> 29:39.143
Guys...

29:39.243 --> 29:40.423
The doors are locked.

29:40.523 --> 29:41.823
Maybe we should reconnect
the phone lines.

29:41.923 --> 29:42.823
They're on the roof!

29:42.923 --> 29:44.463
Guys, I think I've found
something.

29:44.563 --> 29:47.023
-How do you know that?
-Research.

29:47.123 --> 29:48.783
Brady! Gladys!

29:48.883 --> 29:50.264
Will this work?

29:50.364 --> 29:53.124
What are we gonna do,
barbecue our way outta this?

29:57.284 --> 29:59.284
Ah!

30:00.164 --> 30:02.164
Hey, you know I'm, uh...

30:02.564 --> 30:03.664
..pretty handy with a yo-yo.

30:03.764 --> 30:04.944
What?

30:05.044 --> 30:06.665
You know, loop the loop.

30:06.765 --> 30:08.665
Walk the dog, rock the cradle.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.665
You know, the key is
you gotta be...

30:10.765 --> 30:12.425
Ohh!

30:12.525 --> 30:14.625
..gentle.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.945
-You gotta use your wrist.
-I'll break your wrists.

30:17.045 --> 30:19.045
OK.

30:20.765 --> 30:23.426
Hey, Shez, could I have
a glass of water?

30:23.526 --> 30:25.346
-No!
-Please?

30:25.446 --> 30:27.866
It's the middle of summer.
I'm so dry.

30:32.366 --> 30:33.746
What are you doing?

30:33.846 --> 30:35.466
I'm trying to spit.

30:35.566 --> 30:38.107
You're a really weird guy,
you know that?

30:38.207 --> 30:39.267
Thank you.

30:39.367 --> 30:41.367
Not a compliment.

30:42.127 --> 30:44.187
Well, please. Please, Shez.

30:44.287 --> 30:46.667
There's some water behind the
counter. I won't move a muscle.

30:46.767 --> 30:48.847
I swear, I'm not gonna m...

30:56.408 --> 30:58.028
Pete,
what are you doing?!

30:58.128 --> 30:59.908
It's a classic
distraction tactic.

31:00.008 --> 31:01.348
OK, two things.

31:01.448 --> 31:03.828
First, Wombat and Brady are
the mice in the play tunnel.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.148
-Don't know where they've gone.
-What?!

31:05.248 --> 31:08.108
Second, and possibly worse,
I'm in love with Shez.

31:08.208 --> 31:10.549
My God, I'm sweating like
a banana in the sun

31:10.649 --> 31:12.189
and my heart feels like
it's exploding.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.709
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

31:13.809 --> 31:16.309
Because what's a girl like her
gonna want with a guy like me?

31:16.409 --> 31:18.509
No, not that. Why are Wombat
and Brady in the store?

31:18.609 --> 31:20.789
Oh, um, look, they were gonna
meet me after work.

31:20.889 --> 31:23.029
I tried to tell you,
but then Nan came in

31:23.129 --> 31:24.870
and started asking about
your sister and the money.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.550
It's OK. It's OK.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.070
It's all gonna be fine.

31:28.170 --> 31:29.510
I thought maybe
they could help us.

31:29.610 --> 31:30.830
No. I mean, they can't.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.710
They have to stay hidden.
It's safer that way.

31:32.810 --> 31:35.550
Look, if these two get their
money, nobody's gonna get hurt.

31:35.650 --> 31:38.070
OK. Are you sure they're
gonna get their money?

31:38.170 --> 31:39.430
Yes.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.451
Terri might just need
a bit of a push.

31:43.731 --> 31:45.031
Hey!

31:45.131 --> 31:47.511
-Hey...
-Shez, what are you doing?

31:47.611 --> 31:50.431
Hostages don't get water.

31:50.531 --> 31:53.191
- They get hostaged!
- Listen.

31:53.291 --> 31:56.391
Let me call Terri again.
To speed things up.

31:56.491 --> 31:59.292
You let me talk to Terri and I
can get the money here faster.

32:02.852 --> 32:04.852
Do it.

32:10.492 --> 32:12.793
Uh, you said I had an hour.

32:12.893 --> 32:14.673
<i>Terri, it's me, Derrick.</i>

32:14.773 --> 32:17.673
<i>Just checking in about</i>
<i>the money. Are you...</i>

32:17.773 --> 32:18.993
Working on it.

32:19.093 --> 32:22.113
Cool, cool. You might need
to speed things up a bit.

32:22.213 --> 32:25.433
It's just getting a little bit
tense around here.

32:25.533 --> 32:27.533
Yeah, I'm doing my best.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.554
It's a pretty crappy situation
you've thrown at me, you know?

32:30.654 --> 32:32.554
I'm the one being held ransom,

32:32.654 --> 32:34.514
so it's a bit more crappy
for me, yeah?

32:34.614 --> 32:37.234
You obviously have no idea
how hard it is

32:37.334 --> 32:40.234
to withdraw 300K in cash
on Christmas Eve.

32:40.334 --> 32:43.434
Oh, well, sorry we're not
all swimming in millions.

32:43.534 --> 32:45.195
You're the one who got
a business handed to him.

32:45.295 --> 32:47.435
H-handed? Handed?!

32:47.535 --> 32:48.915
Do you know how hard
I've worked?

32:49.015 --> 32:51.075
And by the way, you can't swim
in millions.

32:51.175 --> 32:54.155
I mean, you could probably run a
small bath in millions at best.

32:54.255 --> 32:56.715
The fact that you even know that
says so much.

32:56.815 --> 32:59.555
Oh, my God, you are
so self-righteous.

32:59.655 --> 33:01.356
Well, that's better than
being selfish!

33:01.456 --> 33:02.516
How am I selfish?

33:02.616 --> 33:04.656
You couldn't even make it
to his funeral!

33:09.696 --> 33:12.076
Since you've got it all
figured out, then...

33:12.176 --> 33:13.556
Damn it!

33:13.656 --> 33:15.636
What the bloody hell was that?

33:15.736 --> 33:17.757
Well, I once listened to a
podcast about sibling rivalry...

33:17.857 --> 33:19.157
-Not now, Pete.
-Can it, Pete.

33:19.257 --> 33:20.397
Shut your damn yammer hole,
Pete.

33:20.497 --> 33:22.077
Get her back on the phone,
now.

33:28.697 --> 33:30.717
Yes! Yes!

33:30.817 --> 33:32.818
We did it!

33:35.098 --> 33:37.838
I thought you said
this place was clear!

33:37.938 --> 33:39.838
It is! It...was.

33:39.938 --> 33:43.118
Jesus Christ, it's Smith Street
all over again.

33:43.218 --> 33:44.518
It's nothing like
robbing a servo.

33:44.618 --> 33:46.118
Something must have
set off the alarm.

33:46.218 --> 33:49.619
No, not someTHING, Derrick.

33:54.179 --> 33:55.159
Someone.

33:55.259 --> 33:57.199
-Where's the panel?
-We'll never tell.

33:57.299 --> 33:59.119
Don't! It's behind the counter.

33:59.219 --> 34:01.259
It's behind... It's over there.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.120
It's coming from
the security office.

34:09.220 --> 34:10.600
Oh, no!

34:10.700 --> 34:14.640
If this goes bad,
I'm taking you down with us.

34:14.740 --> 34:16.740
You know that, right?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.040
Guard Pimples and Dimples.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.241
This is my job. I'll go.

34:21.341 --> 34:23.641
That'll take all night!

34:23.741 --> 34:26.041
No, no. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

34:27.781 --> 34:29.681
Pete!

34:29.781 --> 34:31.401
-Oh, help me!
-Pete!

34:31.501 --> 34:32.961
Pete!

34:33.061 --> 34:35.041
Good job, Wombat.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.962
Guess I'm not as smart as
I look.

34:38.062 --> 34:40.622
Um, Gladys...

34:44.262 --> 34:46.522
If she gets this room,
she'll have all the cameras.

34:46.622 --> 34:48.162
There'll be nowhere left
to hide.

34:48.262 --> 34:50.342
She's old! I can take her.

34:52.302 --> 34:53.683
You can take her.

34:53.783 --> 34:55.763
Brady, we have to go
off the grid.

34:55.863 --> 34:58.883
No way! If we show Gladys,
that's it for us.

34:58.983 --> 35:00.083
We haven't got a choice.

35:00.183 --> 35:01.363
Off the grid?

35:01.463 --> 35:03.323
There's one place where
your cameras can't see.

35:03.423 --> 35:06.483
Kid, I've got this place locked
down tighter than a cat's bum.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.443
That's what you think.

35:08.543 --> 35:10.744
And also, gross.

35:13.024 --> 35:14.804
Are we gonna die here,
Mr Harrington?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.324
No.

35:16.424 --> 35:19.604
Just do what they say and we'll
get through this together.

35:20.904 --> 35:23.644
What if she finds
Wombat and Brady?

35:23.744 --> 35:25.745
What if she hurts them?

35:55.866 --> 35:57.867
I'll keep a lookout
for the firetruck.

35:59.187 --> 36:00.447
What is this place?

36:00.547 --> 36:01.647
Wouldn't know.

36:01.747 --> 36:04.367
-Just found it like this.
-Brady!

36:04.467 --> 36:07.507
If we tell her,
she'll kick us out.

36:11.947 --> 36:14.328
-You live here?
-It's just temporary.

36:14.428 --> 36:16.008
Until Pete finds us a new place.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.188
But...where are your parents?

36:21.028 --> 36:23.028
Mum's in heaven.

36:24.068 --> 36:26.068
Oh.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.449
And what about your dad?

36:28.549 --> 36:31.049
-We don't know.
-But he's coming back.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.149
Pete said.

36:33.589 --> 36:34.609
He left his favourite cap.

36:34.709 --> 36:36.329
He always takes it with him

36:36.429 --> 36:38.289
when he's leaving
for a long time.

36:38.389 --> 36:41.629
So he'll definitely be back.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.770
You can't live here.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.410
It's not safe.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.530
Please don't tell anyone.
They'll split us up.

36:50.630 --> 36:52.370
-No, no.
-They've done it before.

36:52.470 --> 36:55.450
But Pete's 18
in two weeks and three days.

36:55.550 --> 36:56.850
And then we can have a place.

36:56.950 --> 37:00.431
And Dad will come home
and it'll all go back to normal.

37:03.511 --> 37:04.451
Hey.

37:04.551 --> 37:06.371
If I've been...

37:06.471 --> 37:08.471
..you know...

37:09.311 --> 37:10.211
..I didn't mean to be.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.371
Apology accepted.

37:12.471 --> 37:15.571
It's just...kids...

37:15.671 --> 37:17.172
..aren't really my thing.

37:17.272 --> 37:19.012
Oh, we know.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.212
We see you some nights,

37:21.312 --> 37:23.532
staying up late,
staring at the baby dolls.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.652
I don't...I don't do that.

37:25.752 --> 37:27.252
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.832
Cup of tea?

37:32.433 --> 37:34.573
Nuh. Nah. I'm right.

37:34.673 --> 37:37.073
-Please?
-We shared our secret.

37:45.673 --> 37:47.673
-Is that lactose-free?
-Mm-hm.

37:52.394 --> 37:54.214
This is the coldest thing
I could find.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.574
Oh!

37:55.674 --> 37:56.854
Thank you.

37:56.954 --> 37:59.974
Shez, it's not too late
to call this off, yeah?

38:00.074 --> 38:02.214
And why the hell
would we do that?

38:02.314 --> 38:04.495
What happened at Smith Street?

38:04.595 --> 38:05.895
Nothing.

38:05.995 --> 38:08.015
I mean, you and Nan don't
exactly seem like a...

38:08.115 --> 38:09.415
..a well-oiled machine.

38:09.515 --> 38:11.135
I just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

38:11.235 --> 38:13.375
Smith Street was a long time ago

38:13.475 --> 38:15.535
and it was my first job.

38:15.635 --> 38:17.175
We're fine now.

38:17.275 --> 38:18.935
Did something go wrong?

38:19.035 --> 38:19.935
No.

38:20.035 --> 38:21.576
Was that how you hurt your leg?

38:21.676 --> 38:23.176
Did you get shot?

38:23.276 --> 38:26.176
I've got cerebral palsy,
you dingo!

38:26.276 --> 38:28.096
Oh. Oh! Sorry.

38:28.196 --> 38:29.616
Oh, well...

38:29.716 --> 38:32.316
Well, pardon my
'terrible callsy'.

38:35.276 --> 38:37.497
Look, Shez, you seem
like a good person.

38:37.597 --> 38:40.617
Yeah? And what makes you
say that?

38:40.717 --> 38:43.997
Because Nan used the cricket bat
and you used the pool noodle.

38:48.637 --> 38:51.097
I guess kids never
really liked me.

38:51.197 --> 38:54.338
I mean, they'd look
at my clean clothes

38:54.438 --> 38:56.498
and respect for the rules and...

38:56.598 --> 38:59.538
..still weren't friendly.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.458
Just last week,

39:01.558 --> 39:03.378
my godson bit me

39:03.478 --> 39:05.758
and I had to throw him
into the baptismal font.

39:09.719 --> 39:11.139
Just made me think.

39:11.239 --> 39:13.359
When I have this baby...

39:15.639 --> 39:17.679
..would they like me?

39:19.639 --> 39:20.779
Well, I like you.

39:20.879 --> 39:22.859
Yeah, me too.

39:22.959 --> 39:24.660
Please!

39:24.760 --> 39:25.820
Yeah, you're funny.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.940
And it's fun when
you try to chase us.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.160
Cheers.

39:45.641 --> 39:47.641
Oi!

39:48.161 --> 39:50.021
Whoever set this off
is still here.

39:50.121 --> 39:53.061
-What?
-They're hiding in the store!

39:53.161 --> 39:54.661
Maybe we left it on earlier.

39:54.761 --> 39:56.222
Maybe we did.

39:56.322 --> 39:58.062
You've had a screw loose
all night.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.182
-You know something!
-I don't.

40:00.282 --> 40:01.742
-No, I don't.
-Leave him alone!

40:01.842 --> 40:03.622
You're gonna blinkin'
tell me now

40:03.722 --> 40:06.822
or I'm gonna file down this toy
spoon and shiv you with it!

40:10.562 --> 40:11.462
F...

40:25.243 --> 40:27.563
It's just like in the movies.

40:28.884 --> 40:30.884
Which one's Greg?

40:31.484 --> 40:33.104
The one with the big hose.

40:33.204 --> 40:35.204
Cool!

40:39.684 --> 40:41.684
Wow!

40:47.365 --> 40:49.425
Nah, it's locked. Get the axe.
Get the axe.

40:49.525 --> 40:52.185
-Mate, what are you doing?
-I'm breaking down the door.

40:52.285 --> 40:54.465
OK, you need to stop, breathe...

40:54.565 --> 40:55.785
There is no time.

40:55.885 --> 40:57.665
Do you smell any smoke?

40:57.765 --> 40:59.145
No, because there isn't any.

40:59.245 --> 41:01.066
Mate, it's Gladys!

41:01.166 --> 41:03.066
-What do you mean?
-Think about it!

41:03.166 --> 41:05.666
The phone call,
now the fire alarm at her work.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.226
Mate, it's a Christmas
booty call.

41:07.326 --> 41:09.026
No, she would not break protocol
like that.

41:09.126 --> 41:11.426
All I'm saying is that there's
no smoke and there's no fire.

41:11.526 --> 41:13.526
Just get the axe!

41:14.846 --> 41:17.147
- Who's in there?
- Hello? Anybody in there?

41:17.247 --> 41:19.347
Everybody needs
to just keep quiet

41:19.447 --> 41:20.827
and stay cool, right?

41:20.927 --> 41:22.667
No, you need to let us go.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.147
What did I just say?

41:24.247 --> 41:26.347
They're about to break down
the door and get us anyway.

41:26.447 --> 41:27.827
-Bring it on!
-Cool it, Nan!

41:27.927 --> 41:29.427
Don't tell me to cool it!

41:29.527 --> 41:31.868
You're the one got us in
this blinkin' mess in the first place!

41:31.968 --> 41:33.948
I didn't know the alarms
would go off!

41:34.048 --> 41:36.148
They didn't go off.
Somebody set them off!

41:36.248 --> 41:38.388
And they were meant to be cut
with the phone lines.

41:38.488 --> 41:40.708
- That wasn't my job.
- Well, it wasn't my job!

41:40.808 --> 41:42.628
OK, stop, alright?
I can fix this.

41:42.728 --> 41:44.508
Hey! You stay put!

41:44.608 --> 41:46.708
Let me talk to them.
I can get them to leave.

41:46.808 --> 41:48.309
No, no, no! Mr Harrington!
No, no, no.

41:48.409 --> 41:50.269
This is the safest thing
for everyone, Pete.

41:50.369 --> 41:51.749
Derrick's right.

41:51.849 --> 41:54.709
So we let the smooth-talker
just 'speed things up' again?

41:54.809 --> 41:57.349
Nan, I'm really sorry

41:57.449 --> 41:59.469
about Smith Street,
but if we get caught,

41:59.569 --> 42:01.769
you're gonna go away for
a lot longer than five years.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.230
Fine!

42:04.330 --> 42:06.330
Let's go, chicken legs.

42:08.370 --> 42:09.910
Right.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.790
Stand back, stand back! OK.

42:11.890 --> 42:13.830
Three, two, one!

42:13.930 --> 42:16.350
Whoa! Ooh!

42:16.450 --> 42:18.670
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

42:18.770 --> 42:19.951
What's up?

42:20.051 --> 42:21.791
Mr Harrington. Uh...

42:21.891 --> 42:24.791
Hey, is...
Is everything alright?

42:24.891 --> 42:28.791
Oh, sorry, fellas.
That was all on me.

42:28.891 --> 42:30.391
I was trying to heat up
my dinner

42:30.491 --> 42:31.871
on one of these
My First Barbecues.

42:31.971 --> 42:35.591
Got distracted and...
whole thing went up in smoke!

42:35.691 --> 42:37.272
Oh.

42:37.372 --> 42:39.372
So there's no fire?

42:41.772 --> 42:43.952
No. No, nothin' to worry about.

42:44.052 --> 42:46.912
Well, look, usually
there is a call-out fee

42:47.012 --> 42:48.392
for this kind of thing, but...

42:48.492 --> 42:51.833
..you did donate all those toys
to the bushfire appeal,

42:51.933 --> 42:52.953
so we'll let it slide.

42:53.053 --> 42:54.553
Ah! Thanks, guys.

42:54.653 --> 42:56.553
Really appreciate it.

42:56.653 --> 42:58.273
Well, have a good night!

42:58.373 --> 43:00.033
OK.

43:00.133 --> 43:03.173
Hey, uh, just...
just one more thing, um...

43:05.653 --> 43:07.073
Is Gladys in tonight?

43:07.173 --> 43:09.174
Just...I got a missed call
from her. I was just...

43:10.534 --> 43:11.634
No.

43:11.734 --> 43:13.234
Sorry, Greg.

43:13.334 --> 43:15.614
I, uh, sent her home early.

43:16.694 --> 43:18.694
OK. Alright.

43:19.814 --> 43:20.794
Have a good night.

43:20.894 --> 43:22.894
Yeah.

43:27.575 --> 43:29.835
-Hey, I'm sorry, man.
-Yeah.

43:29.935 --> 43:31.635
Wasn't a booty call.
It was a butt dial.

43:31.735 --> 43:33.315
What the hell
is he doing?!

43:33.415 --> 43:34.795
Why aren't they coming in?

43:34.895 --> 43:37.715
Greg! Greg!

43:37.815 --> 43:40.316
-Come on, up here!
-Help!

43:40.416 --> 43:42.356
-Help!
-Hello!

43:46.816 --> 43:48.356
Ohh!

43:48.456 --> 43:51.556
Help! Come on, up here!

43:51.656 --> 43:53.316
Help! We're up here!

43:53.416 --> 43:55.276
-Help!
-Gladys?

43:55.376 --> 43:56.277
Greg!

43:56.377 --> 43:58.077
Did she swallow
a basketball?

43:58.177 --> 43:59.557
You're pregnant!

43:59.657 --> 44:02.237
Help! There's someone
in the building!

44:02.337 --> 44:04.337
They're holding us hostage!

44:07.137 --> 44:09.037
Oh! Oh, my bum!

44:09.137 --> 44:10.877
-No!
-Oh, my God!

44:10.977 --> 44:13.358
-Inside. Inside!
-I'm hit! I'm hit!

44:13.458 --> 44:15.838
-They shot him!
-Shut the door!

44:15.938 --> 44:19.518
How about I shoot you in the
butt and see if you like it?!

44:19.618 --> 44:20.758
Snap out of it!

44:20.858 --> 44:22.838
A bullet in the butt
is hardly lethal.

44:22.938 --> 44:25.558
Where do we go?
This map is useless!

44:25.658 --> 44:27.158
Let's head to the roof.

44:27.258 --> 44:29.259
We can hide in the kangaroo.

44:30.899 --> 44:32.199
Ah! Oh!

44:32.299 --> 44:34.839
You saved me. Thank you!

44:34.939 --> 44:36.119
It's OK. It's OK.

44:36.219 --> 44:38.279
Tell...tell Gladys I love her!

44:38.379 --> 44:40.559
No! You tell her yourself.

44:40.659 --> 44:42.279
I'm applying pressure.

44:42.379 --> 44:44.120
Ahhh!

44:44.220 --> 44:46.440
HQ, this is truck 25. We need
immediate police assistance.

44:46.540 --> 44:48.680
Shots fired at
Harringtons toy store.

44:48.780 --> 44:50.240
I repeat, shots fired!

44:52.300 --> 44:54.640
Oh, my God, Nan! You shot him!

44:54.740 --> 44:56.600
-They're gonna call the cops!
-No.

44:56.700 --> 44:59.280
You shot him when you
screwed this thing up!

44:59.380 --> 45:01.041
-We have to go.
-Yeah?

45:01.141 --> 45:03.401
You gonna bail on me? Again?

45:03.501 --> 45:05.601
I told you there were roadworks

45:05.701 --> 45:08.281
and the lollipop lady
wouldn't wave me through.

45:08.381 --> 45:10.201
You went soft on me
in Smith Street

45:10.301 --> 45:12.001
and you're going soft on me now.

45:12.101 --> 45:14.161
I was 14 years old!

45:14.261 --> 45:17.122
Who makes a teenager
their getaway driver?

45:17.222 --> 45:21.242
Listen, I went away for
a long time because of you.

45:21.342 --> 45:24.202
You wanna make it up to me?
Now's your chance.

45:24.302 --> 45:26.302
You in or you out?

45:28.742 --> 45:30.782
-I'm in.
-Good girl.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.923
Watch these two like hawks.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.763
Nana's in the driver's seat now.

45:35.863 --> 45:37.403
Where are you going?

45:37.503 --> 45:38.643
Huntin'!

45:38.743 --> 45:41.403
More hostages, more cash.

45:43.183 --> 45:46.663
Hey. Hey, you OK?
You OK, Mr Harrington?

45:48.184 --> 45:49.564
The guns are real.

45:49.664 --> 45:50.844
What do you mean?

45:50.944 --> 45:53.664
I just... I didn't think
the guns would be real.

45:58.944 --> 46:00.944
Quickly!

46:02.984 --> 46:03.885
Gotcha!

46:05.465 --> 46:07.645
-You're mine.
-Run!

46:07.745 --> 46:10.245
Go, save yourselves! Ahh!

46:10.345 --> 46:12.205
Come on, Gladys! Come on!

46:12.305 --> 46:13.645
What are you doing, you idiots?

46:13.745 --> 46:15.165
Never leave a man behind.

46:15.265 --> 46:16.685
Leavin'?

46:16.785 --> 46:19.726
Who said anything about leavin'?

46:19.826 --> 46:23.986
Out of the fire
and into the frying Nan.

46:24.986 --> 46:26.986
Let's go, little mice.

46:35.787 --> 46:37.607
OK.

46:37.707 --> 46:39.707
OK, be gentle!

46:40.147 --> 46:41.847
Mr Harrington?

46:41.947 --> 46:43.607
If you didn't think
their guns were real,

46:43.707 --> 46:45.707
why did you help them?

46:46.787 --> 46:48.887
I just...couldn't take a chance.

46:50.987 --> 46:53.308
Found your rats.

46:55.108 --> 46:57.008
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

46:57.108 --> 46:58.808
Wombat, Brady. Where were you?
Are you two alright?

46:58.908 --> 47:00.448
- Come here.
- We're fine.

47:00.548 --> 47:01.928
- Gladys helped us.
- Gladys.

47:02.028 --> 47:03.968
What are you doing here?
I sent you home.

47:04.068 --> 47:07.048
I was trying to catch
a couple of crims.

47:07.148 --> 47:09.729
Clearly I was after
the wrong ones!

47:09.829 --> 47:12.849
Two kids
and a knocked-up Girl Scout.

47:12.949 --> 47:14.929
We were sweating our tits off
for nothin'!

47:15.029 --> 47:16.489
Smile!

47:16.589 --> 47:18.609
Are you kidding?

47:18.709 --> 47:20.849
Do you know what kind of
jail time you'll get

47:20.949 --> 47:22.609
if anything happens
to those kids?

47:25.390 --> 47:27.390
That's one way
of looking at it.

47:35.310 --> 47:37.310
Oh!

47:37.950 --> 47:40.751
Showtime!

47:41.871 --> 47:43.691
Hello, yes? Derrick's phone?

47:43.791 --> 47:45.371
<i>Uh, what is going on?</i>

47:45.471 --> 47:46.571
<i>Why are there children there?</i>

47:46.671 --> 47:48.891
And...and who do
you think you are?

47:48.991 --> 47:50.531
Shut it, Richie Bitch.

47:50.631 --> 47:53.091
Payday's just gone up.

47:53.191 --> 47:56.212
We found ourselves
a couple of extra hostages,

47:56.312 --> 47:58.912
so we figure that's
a bit more work for us.

48:00.032 --> 48:01.412
Ransom's gone up.

48:01.512 --> 48:02.972
400K.

48:03.072 --> 48:04.452
Ohhh!

48:04.552 --> 48:07.172
Terri, pay the money
and end this, please!

48:07.272 --> 48:08.652
I ju... I can't!

48:08.752 --> 48:10.532
<i>I...I...</i>

48:13.673 --> 48:15.813
Still can't? Righto!

48:15.913 --> 48:18.213
We'll start with a two-for-one.

48:18.313 --> 48:21.453
-Whoa, whoa! No, let her go!
-Mr Harrington!

48:21.553 --> 48:23.253
You've got three seconds, Terri.

48:23.353 --> 48:25.093
What's going on?
Guys, are you OK?

48:25.193 --> 48:27.174
-Nan, let her go.
-Nan, she's pregnant.

48:27.274 --> 48:29.374
-This has gone far enough!
-Two.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.254
-No! Gladys!
-No, please!

48:31.354 --> 48:34.214
So this is what it means
to die hard.

48:34.314 --> 48:36.414
<i>Derrick! Derrick!</i>

48:36.514 --> 48:38.874
-One.
-Enough!

48:40.474 --> 48:41.534
It's off.

48:41.634 --> 48:43.815
Put the gun down.

48:43.915 --> 48:45.915
That is an order.

48:49.955 --> 48:51.955
What's off?

48:52.355 --> 48:54.355
The ransom.

48:56.155 --> 48:57.295
Y-you set it up?

48:57.395 --> 48:59.336
That's why you sent us home.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.716
That's why you thought
the guns were fake.

49:08.596 --> 49:10.736
I'm sorry.

49:10.836 --> 49:12.836
No, I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

49:14.956 --> 49:16.957
It was not meant
to end like this.

49:17.917 --> 49:19.297
OK?

49:19.397 --> 49:22.517
I tried to keep the place
running. I really did.

49:26.317 --> 49:27.937
I didn't know what to do.

49:31.798 --> 49:34.758
So your solution
was faking a ransom?

49:36.478 --> 49:40.238
Terri, I know you've hated me
since Dad died.

49:42.678 --> 49:45.358
I got scared to ask
for anything.

49:47.999 --> 49:50.159
And then I got desperate.

49:51.599 --> 49:53.179
And it wasn't supposed
to be dangerous.

49:53.279 --> 49:55.679
You weren't even supposed
to be here.

49:56.679 --> 49:59.979
Right? Then you brought
your friggin' Nan.

50:00.079 --> 50:02.279
Derrick.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.420
It's just supposed to be
a win-win.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.280
Shez gets half,
I get the other half.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.020
And then I was gonna
make things right.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.660
Mate, you're about as dense
as a fully packed cone

50:15.760 --> 50:19.381
if you thought we were ever
gonna split halvesies with you.

50:19.481 --> 50:21.821
Well, that was the deal.

50:21.921 --> 50:23.581
We're criminals, Derrick.

50:23.681 --> 50:27.301
And deals, much like
laws and regulations,

50:27.401 --> 50:29.681
don't actually mean
that much to us.

50:31.041 --> 50:32.781
Shez.

50:32.881 --> 50:34.882
Shez!

50:39.162 --> 50:41.302
You were wrong.

50:41.402 --> 50:43.402
I'm not a good person.

50:44.642 --> 50:46.642
Did you get
all that, Terri?

50:49.562 --> 50:51.703
Yeah. You'll get your money.

50:51.803 --> 50:52.783
Ace.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.783
So there's a black ute

50:55.883 --> 50:57.543
parked across the road
from your office

50:57.643 --> 51:01.343
<i>and two rather handsome boys</i>
<i>waiting to escort you here.</i>

51:01.443 --> 51:03.303
A black ute?

51:03.403 --> 51:04.663
Nan, you didn't.

51:04.763 --> 51:06.824
Keep on tying, Sherrin.

51:06.924 --> 51:10.984
I wanna be chuggin' a beer
in Bali on Boxing Day.

51:12.524 --> 51:14.344
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

51:21.764 --> 51:23.785
It's just a scratch.

51:23.885 --> 51:26.225
Gladys is pregnant?
Why didn't she tell me?

51:26.325 --> 51:28.065
I didn't see that comin'.

51:28.165 --> 51:31.305
Look, if she's chosen somebody
else, that's...that's OK.

51:31.405 --> 51:34.165
I just... We just have to
make sure she's safe, OK?

51:35.565 --> 51:36.545
Good evening, boys.

51:36.645 --> 51:37.825
My name's Constable Karen.

51:37.925 --> 51:39.926
I'll be your negotiator
for the evening.

51:40.326 --> 51:42.326
It's time to save
another Christmas.

51:42.646 --> 51:44.426
You work holidays a lot?

51:44.526 --> 51:47.306
Oh! Diwali, Hanukkah,
King's Birthday.

51:47.406 --> 51:48.906
It's all a nightmare.
But you know what?

51:49.006 --> 51:50.386
Christmas is the bloody worst.

51:50.486 --> 51:51.906
What's the sitch?

51:52.006 --> 51:54.506
Uh, the situation is
at least one armed bandit.

51:54.606 --> 51:55.867
He's only got one arm?

51:55.967 --> 51:56.867
No, she's got two.

51:56.967 --> 51:59.227
Oh! Slay, queen! Yes.

51:59.327 --> 52:01.227
She's holding at least
four hostages.

52:01.327 --> 52:02.947
Two kids, one man...

52:03.047 --> 52:04.787
..and a pregnant woman.

52:04.887 --> 52:07.507
Wow! Got ourselves a full house,
don't we?

52:07.607 --> 52:10.007
Alright, I'm gonna go warm up.
Thank you very much.

52:11.208 --> 52:12.468
The personable police officer

52:12.568 --> 52:13.908
patrolled the public park
personally.

52:14.008 --> 52:15.508
The personable police officer

52:15.608 --> 52:17.608
patrolled the public park
personally.

52:18.688 --> 52:20.588
Hey, I don't wanna
scare you, but...

52:20.688 --> 52:22.228
..they're screwed.

52:30.449 --> 52:31.749
Here. Shez.

52:31.849 --> 52:34.129
Empty the cash registers.

52:38.889 --> 52:40.889
Is everybody OK?

52:42.810 --> 52:45.030
You know, if we just...
do what they say...

52:45.130 --> 52:47.350
Shut up, Derrick!
What were you thinking?

52:47.450 --> 52:49.470
Risking our lives,

52:49.570 --> 52:51.270
bringing those two in here!

52:51.370 --> 52:53.030
Dinosaurs! Yeah!

52:53.130 --> 52:54.510
It's OK, Mr Harrington.

52:54.610 --> 52:56.270
No, it's not, Wombat.

52:56.370 --> 52:58.370
Don't talk to him.

53:01.771 --> 53:03.871
The debt collectors are gonna
take over this place,

53:03.971 --> 53:05.971
leaving you all high and dry.

53:07.331 --> 53:09.231
At least this way
I could pay off the debts,

53:09.331 --> 53:11.331
I could pay you off.

53:11.651 --> 53:13.651
And I could close it down.

53:14.131 --> 53:15.472
You're gonna close down
the store?

53:15.572 --> 53:18.072
Today was our last day.

53:18.172 --> 53:20.072
What?

53:20.172 --> 53:22.272
You're giving up?

53:22.372 --> 53:24.372
Giving up?

53:24.892 --> 53:26.632
I've tried everything, Gladys.

53:26.732 --> 53:30.252
I just can't run this place
as good as my dad could.

53:31.373 --> 53:32.833
I mortgaged my house,

53:32.933 --> 53:34.713
I worked 24/7,

53:34.813 --> 53:37.753
I've taken out every loan
imaginable.

53:37.853 --> 53:40.293
And I still can't get it right.

53:42.253 --> 53:44.773
And what's worse is
I failed you too.

53:48.774 --> 53:50.774
So, yeah.

53:51.174 --> 53:52.394
I've given up.

53:54.294 --> 53:57.474
Hey? Hey. It's OK.

53:57.574 --> 54:00.994
No, it's not.
Where are we gonna live now?

54:01.094 --> 54:04.275
We can find your dad.
We can get him to come back.

54:04.375 --> 54:06.375
No, he's never coming back.

54:07.575 --> 54:09.955
But...but you said...

54:10.055 --> 54:12.655
I know. I...I was wrong.

54:14.935 --> 54:16.935
You're living here?

54:18.295 --> 54:19.876
I had no idea.

54:19.976 --> 54:21.976
Did you know about this?

54:23.056 --> 54:25.696
Do you know what makes this
store so special, Mr Harrington?

54:27.656 --> 54:30.496
It's not the store
or...or the toys. It's...

54:33.736 --> 54:35.197
It's the people. It's...

54:35.297 --> 54:38.297
It's all of us.
It's all of us together.

54:41.537 --> 54:44.177
Harringtons isn't a store.
It's a...it's a family.

54:48.617 --> 54:50.117
And if you're giving up
on the store,

54:50.217 --> 54:52.218
then you're giving up on us.

54:57.778 --> 54:59.078
<i>We have the money.</i>

54:59.178 --> 55:01.038
<i>Bring the hostages</i>
<i>to the front door</i>

55:01.138 --> 55:03.338
<i>so we can facilitate</i>
<i>the handover.</i>

55:04.538 --> 55:07.239
We have the place surrounded,
so don't try anything funny.

55:07.339 --> 55:09.879
Unless that's part of
your negotiations.

55:09.979 --> 55:11.559
Get 'em up.

55:16.219 --> 55:17.239
Oh!

55:33.980 --> 55:35.980
- Come on.
- Get off me!

55:44.341 --> 55:46.501
OK.

55:50.581 --> 55:52.641
Right, here's the deal.

55:52.741 --> 55:55.162
Derrick goes, gets the money,

55:55.262 --> 55:59.042
my accomplices
drive us out of here,

55:59.142 --> 56:01.242
you guys come in
and save the children,

56:01.342 --> 56:02.922
we're all home
for Christmas lunch.

56:03.022 --> 56:04.162
Got it?

56:04.262 --> 56:07.542
Yes, but how do we know
the hostages are safe?

56:08.662 --> 56:10.663
How do I know the money's
in the bag?!

56:12.423 --> 56:14.283
Oh, yeah. Checkmate.

56:14.383 --> 56:16.383
Alright, deal.

56:21.983 --> 56:23.983
Hi.

56:24.383 --> 56:26.384
Hi.

56:27.744 --> 56:29.744
I-I'm sorry.

56:30.544 --> 56:33.804
Look, I don't hate you.

56:33.904 --> 56:36.664
I know you think I just
left when Dad died, but...

56:38.224 --> 56:40.244
..I think I was left out
way before that.

56:40.344 --> 56:42.745
What do you mean?

56:43.785 --> 56:45.945
It's not Harrington & Daughters.

56:51.865 --> 56:54.565
Oh, darling,
did you wet yourself?

56:54.665 --> 56:56.325
Don't worry,
I-I do it all the time.

56:56.425 --> 56:57.965
No, her waters broke!

56:58.065 --> 56:59.566
No, no, no,
I actually wet myself.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.646
It's really embarrassing.

57:01.746 --> 57:03.166
She's got a weapon!

57:03.266 --> 57:05.126
Put your gun down!

57:05.226 --> 57:07.226
Put it down.

57:07.626 --> 57:09.526
Step away from the preggo.

57:09.626 --> 57:11.166
Right, that's it! Deal's off.

57:11.266 --> 57:13.686
Grab 'em! Everyone inside.

57:13.786 --> 57:15.527
Don't do anything stupid, toots.

57:15.627 --> 57:18.887
You don't do anything stupid.
Ransoms are the stupid thing.

57:18.987 --> 57:21.927
No, no, she needs to get
to a hospital!

57:22.027 --> 57:24.047
Don't... I take it back.
I'm sorry.

57:24.147 --> 57:27.247
-Derrick!
-Let her go!

57:28.907 --> 57:30.848
You can stand down.

57:30.948 --> 57:32.948
Gonna be here all night.

57:34.668 --> 57:37.068
Ohhh, my boss is gonna kill me!

57:41.628 --> 57:43.288
Screwed up again, did you, Shez?

57:43.388 --> 57:45.648
Hm! Told you she would.

57:45.748 --> 57:47.889
Hi, Uncle Jacko. Uncle Ricko.

57:47.989 --> 57:49.649
Let her go.

57:49.749 --> 57:52.289
-Wait, what's going on?
-Don't you hurt him!

57:52.389 --> 57:54.089
Hold it open! Help me!

57:54.189 --> 57:55.969
Let go of me! Ow!

57:56.069 --> 57:57.529
Oh, my God, the baby's comin'!

57:57.629 --> 58:00.409
No, no, no, it's just a cramp.
I've been having them all day.

58:00.509 --> 58:01.889
Told you
it was Braxton Hicks.

58:01.989 --> 58:03.570
She needs to go to a hospital.

58:03.670 --> 58:04.850
Shut up!

58:04.950 --> 58:05.970
Let's go.

58:06.070 --> 58:08.250
Where? They've got the place
surrounded.

58:08.350 --> 58:09.450
-To the roof!
-What?!

58:09.550 --> 58:10.730
We're taking the kangaroo.

58:10.830 --> 58:12.890
Always have a backup plan, Shez.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.130
A little trick I learned
after Smith Street.

58:15.230 --> 58:16.970
From you, actually.

58:17.070 --> 58:19.571
Come ba...

58:19.671 --> 58:23.131
..ahhh...

58:23.231 --> 58:25.411
..ack.

58:25.511 --> 58:27.931
Hey, darl, just remember,

58:28.031 --> 58:29.971
if you're not pooing,
you're not pushing.

58:30.071 --> 58:31.451
What?

58:31.551 --> 58:33.551
Let's go!

58:34.032 --> 58:35.492
Shez, now!

58:35.592 --> 58:37.592
Shez!

58:42.352 --> 58:44.532
Gladys, Gladys, are you alright?

58:44.632 --> 58:46.332
Gladys, you need to
take it easy.

58:47.992 --> 58:49.252
What's she doing?

58:49.352 --> 58:53.773
They hurt my Greg!

58:53.873 --> 58:54.773
Oh!

58:54.873 --> 58:56.453
She has the power of two humans!

58:56.553 --> 58:57.893
Shh! Shh!

58:57.993 --> 58:59.693
Yeah, here, here!

58:59.793 --> 59:01.293
Oh!

59:01.393 --> 59:03.393
OK. Here, here.

59:03.993 --> 59:05.253
Wait, where are you going?

59:05.353 --> 59:06.694
I let you down, Terri.

59:06.794 --> 59:08.794
I let everyone down.

59:10.434 --> 59:12.434
And now it's time
to make things right.

59:13.914 --> 59:15.574
You all get out of here.

59:15.674 --> 59:17.534
Derrick, wait!

59:17.634 --> 59:19.814
And you wanted to bail!

59:19.914 --> 59:21.774
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

59:21.874 --> 59:23.535
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

59:23.635 --> 59:25.635
Oi!

59:26.475 --> 59:28.095
That's not your money.

59:28.195 --> 59:30.095
And what are you gonna
do about it, Derrick?

59:30.195 --> 59:32.255
You're all alone.

59:32.355 --> 59:35.255
Hey!

59:35.355 --> 59:38.816
Got about 50 more of these over
here if you don't shut up!

59:41.916 --> 59:43.776
-What are you doing?
-We're family!

59:43.876 --> 59:45.136
Or were you not listening?

59:45.236 --> 59:47.476
Alright, lock and load.

59:49.436 --> 59:51.436
Fire!

59:59.157 --> 1:00:01.217
Shez, gimme your gun!

1:00:01.317 --> 1:00:02.337
Nan!

1:00:02.437 --> 1:00:05.057
Nan, wait!

1:00:07.557 --> 1:00:09.557
Ow!

1:00:10.198 --> 1:00:12.658
He told us
not to bring real guns.

1:00:12.758 --> 1:00:16.958
Oh, my God, are you blinking
kidding me right now?

1:00:25.919 --> 1:00:27.499
Stop!

1:00:27.599 --> 1:00:30.299
We'll take the back stairs.
Gladys, stay where you are.

1:00:30.399 --> 1:00:33.439
Not on your goddamn life! Ohhh!

1:00:34.799 --> 1:00:36.899
Come on, come at me.

1:00:40.799 --> 1:00:42.660
-I can take him.
-Are you kidding me?

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:44.460
You can't bring an arm
to a nunchucka fight.

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.180
-You got a better idea?
-No. But that one stinks.

1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:48.260
You stink.

1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:49.580
-Now!
-What?

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:51.580
Arggh! Come on!

1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.940
What are you gonna do,
hit me with your yo-yo?

1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:59.981
It's like I said,
you gotta be gentle, right?

1:01:00.081 --> 1:01:01.421
Kill him!

1:01:06.081 --> 1:01:07.621
I don't want to fight.

1:01:07.721 --> 1:01:10.241
I'm a lover, not a fighter,
Sherrin.

1:01:30.763 --> 1:01:34.763
Stay down!

1:01:37.763 --> 1:01:38.663
Ready!

1:01:38.763 --> 1:01:40.143
Release!

1:01:40.243 --> 1:01:42.783
-Cheers, Grandma!
-Grab it, grab it!

1:01:42.883 --> 1:01:43.943
Whoa! Whoa-oh!

1:01:44.043 --> 1:01:45.744
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1:01:48.724 --> 1:01:51.624
Terri, stand back, I got this.

1:01:51.724 --> 1:01:52.784
Terri?

1:02:02.045 --> 1:02:04.065
Ugh!

1:02:04.165 --> 1:02:06.165
Ow!

1:02:36.727 --> 1:02:38.847
Arggh!

1:02:40.967 --> 1:02:41.947
Ooh! Ugh!

1:02:42.047 --> 1:02:45.507
Now, stay down, crab boy!

1:02:45.607 --> 1:02:47.607
Hey!
Let go of my brother.

1:02:49.447 --> 1:02:51.508
-I can't get a clean shot.
-Uh-oh!

1:02:51.608 --> 1:02:53.068
Wombat, look at me!

1:02:53.168 --> 1:02:54.228
What?

1:02:54.328 --> 1:02:56.468
Let her rip.

1:02:59.328 --> 1:03:01.588
Ugh!

1:03:01.688 --> 1:03:02.788
Wombat!

1:03:02.888 --> 1:03:04.228
Arggh!

1:03:06.969 --> 1:03:09.349
Run!

1:03:12.089 --> 1:03:13.349
<i>Uh-oh, Mama,</i>

1:03:13.449 --> 1:03:15.449
<i>time for a lie-down.</i>

1:03:16.329 --> 1:03:17.669
Oh!

1:03:23.530 --> 1:03:25.310
Ahhh!

1:03:31.050 --> 1:03:32.950
Nice tactic,
causing that diversion.

1:03:36.090 --> 1:03:38.511
Yeah, diversion.

1:03:40.011 --> 1:03:42.151
Is that coming from in here?

1:03:42.251 --> 1:03:44.251
Is this a ransom or a rave?

1:03:45.211 --> 1:03:48.031
We should probably focus.

1:03:48.131 --> 1:03:50.131
Nuh? OK.

1:03:52.371 --> 1:03:54.672
-Think fast!
-Whoa!

1:03:54.772 --> 1:03:56.772
Give me the money.

1:03:58.372 --> 1:04:00.372
I could have used
the cricket bat.

1:04:02.852 --> 1:04:04.512
Now, get outta here.

1:04:04.612 --> 1:04:05.832
Good girl, Shez!

1:04:05.932 --> 1:04:07.932
How's this for a getaway car?

1:04:18.493 --> 1:04:19.513
Wow!

1:04:22.213 --> 1:04:24.213
Ughhh.

1:04:26.494 --> 1:04:29.254
Oh!

1:04:30.294 --> 1:04:32.294
Sherrin.

1:04:35.134 --> 1:04:37.134
Hey, meathead!

1:04:39.534 --> 1:04:40.834
Ugh!

1:04:45.735 --> 1:04:47.895
Ugh!

1:04:51.055 --> 1:04:54.115
I'm so sorry. Am I fired?

1:04:54.215 --> 1:04:56.215
Come on!

1:04:57.416 --> 1:04:59.416
Good girl!

1:05:01.456 --> 1:05:03.636
Give the bag to Nanna!

1:05:03.736 --> 1:05:04.956
No.

1:05:07.816 --> 1:05:09.816
Shez.

1:05:11.336 --> 1:05:12.596
We're family.

1:05:12.696 --> 1:05:14.237
Yeah.

1:05:14.337 --> 1:05:16.337
But I'm nothing like you.

1:05:18.657 --> 1:05:20.357
I'm out.

1:05:20.457 --> 1:05:23.837
Hey, come here!

1:05:23.937 --> 1:05:25.757
Shez!

1:05:25.857 --> 1:05:27.477
Sweetie!

1:05:29.177 --> 1:05:31.298
You were never really in.

1:05:40.898 --> 1:05:42.898
Shez!

1:05:45.579 --> 1:05:46.519
Oh!

1:05:46.619 --> 1:05:48.619
Hey!

1:05:49.779 --> 1:05:51.779
Nan, she's getting away!

1:05:55.779 --> 1:05:57.839
Would you stop dancing?

1:05:57.939 --> 1:05:58.919
Please?

1:05:59.019 --> 1:06:01.360
Pfff.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:03.480
Boring!

1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:13.720
-Oh!
-I got it!

1:06:13.820 --> 1:06:15.280
-Oh!
-Wait, let me, let me!

1:06:15.380 --> 1:06:17.381
Let me. Let me. Oh!

1:06:18.581 --> 1:06:20.581
Here, here, I got it, here.

1:06:21.261 --> 1:06:23.521
Oh, my God!

1:06:23.621 --> 1:06:24.921
We need more manpower!

1:06:25.021 --> 1:06:27.121
- Oh!
- What are you doing?!

1:06:27.221 --> 1:06:28.441
Let's get a wriggle on!

1:06:28.541 --> 1:06:29.521
Oh!

1:06:29.621 --> 1:06:32.841
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1:06:32.941 --> 1:06:34.722
Hello, Skippy!

1:06:43.862 --> 1:06:45.862
Stop!

1:06:53.063 --> 1:06:54.363
What are you doing?!

1:06:54.463 --> 1:06:56.923
You can't stop me, Derrick!

1:06:57.023 --> 1:06:59.023
Derrick!

1:06:59.383 --> 1:07:01.643
Just leave it!

1:07:01.743 --> 1:07:03.163
I can't!

1:07:03.263 --> 1:07:04.363
Damn it!

1:07:04.463 --> 1:07:07.504
- No! Don't!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1:07:10.584 --> 1:07:13.944
You're running out of room!

1:07:17.744 --> 1:07:19.404
-Oh!
-Come on!

1:07:19.504 --> 1:07:22.205
Hey, let go!

1:07:24.305 --> 1:07:26.665
No!

1:07:28.985 --> 1:07:30.525
OK, on three.

1:07:30.625 --> 1:07:32.645
One, two, three!

1:07:32.745 --> 1:07:35.685
Stop it!

1:07:35.785 --> 1:07:37.086
Keep going, we've got her!

1:07:37.186 --> 1:07:39.786
Arggh!

1:07:40.826 --> 1:07:43.886
No, no. It's OK.
Stop her, please!

1:07:47.026 --> 1:07:50.086
You can't all come to Bali
with me!

1:07:52.226 --> 1:07:53.847
I think she's crowning!

1:07:53.947 --> 1:07:57.407
-I've still got pants on!
-What does crowning even mean?

1:07:57.507 --> 1:07:59.407
I don't know!

1:07:59.507 --> 1:08:01.487
Gladys! Gladys, Gladys, Gladys!

1:08:01.587 --> 1:08:02.487
Go back!

1:08:05.507 --> 1:08:07.047
-Derrick
-What?

1:08:07.147 --> 1:08:09.148
Just let it go.

1:08:16.028 --> 1:08:18.648
Derrick, no!

1:08:18.748 --> 1:08:22.148
Merry Christmas, chumps!

1:08:23.268 --> 1:08:25.209
Oh-ho, we're doing this!

1:08:30.389 --> 1:08:32.489
If that's the bad guys
I'm in a lot of trouble.

1:08:32.589 --> 1:08:34.129
Merry Christmas!

1:08:34.229 --> 1:08:37.169
I'm the Nan of the world!

1:08:41.390 --> 1:08:43.870
I'm sorry, everyone.

1:08:44.990 --> 1:08:46.850
Are you kidding?

1:08:46.950 --> 1:08:49.450
I'm the one
who needs to apologise.

1:08:49.550 --> 1:08:52.150
Also, Gladys...

1:08:53.150 --> 1:08:54.690
..I think you're having a baby.

1:08:54.790 --> 1:08:56.730
Yes.

1:08:56.830 --> 1:08:57.931
Me too.

1:08:59.711 --> 1:09:02.111
Arggh!

1:09:03.511 --> 1:09:05.971
We just need to get to the door.

1:09:06.071 --> 1:09:07.971
-There's an ambulance outside.
-Ow, my hand.

1:09:08.071 --> 1:09:09.851
- No, no. It's coming!
- I'll get the blanket.

1:09:09.951 --> 1:09:12.331
-Wombat, you get all them.
-No, stay up, stay up!

1:09:15.992 --> 1:09:18.252
Pop her down.

1:09:20.592 --> 1:09:23.732
I can't do it.

1:09:23.832 --> 1:09:26.252
-I can't do it!
-Snap out of it!

1:09:26.352 --> 1:09:27.652
The kid's gonna love you.

1:09:29.593 --> 1:09:33.213
Oh! OK, alright, Gladys,
you're gonna need to push.

1:09:33.313 --> 1:09:36.373
Oh, no, somebody call Greg!

1:09:39.433 --> 1:09:41.433
-Glad-wrap!
-Let's go!

1:09:59.634 --> 1:10:02.635
Must be something to eat
in here.

1:10:03.635 --> 1:10:05.535
What's this?

1:10:05.635 --> 1:10:07.635
"Greg-Nog."

1:10:19.116 --> 1:10:21.116
Oh, yuck!

1:10:22.436 --> 1:10:24.956
That was the most beautiful
birth I've ever seen.

1:10:27.036 --> 1:10:30.536
Um, are you OK?

1:10:30.636 --> 1:10:31.976
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

1:10:32.076 --> 1:10:33.937
I'm OK. Are you?

1:10:34.037 --> 1:10:36.457
-You got shot.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1:10:36.557 --> 1:10:40.257
They said it was just a graze,
but the pain, Gladys...

1:10:40.357 --> 1:10:43.077
Oh, I can't describe it.

1:10:44.077 --> 1:10:45.297
I can't imagine.

1:10:45.397 --> 1:10:46.457
Yeah.

1:10:46.557 --> 1:10:47.577
Hey, uh...

1:10:47.677 --> 1:10:50.538
Oh, sh-sh-sh-sh.

1:10:50.638 --> 1:10:52.458
-Shh.
-Congratulations.

1:10:52.558 --> 1:10:55.358
Congratulations to you
and...and...and, um...

1:10:56.998 --> 1:10:59.118
You, you idiot.

1:11:01.038 --> 1:11:03.298
-Me?
-Yeah.

1:11:03.398 --> 1:11:04.739
I'm a...I'm a...I'm a dad?

1:11:04.839 --> 1:11:06.839
Yeah!

1:11:09.039 --> 1:11:12.179
I'm sorry, Greg, I...
I tried to tell you,

1:11:12.279 --> 1:11:14.579
but whenever we went to meet up,

1:11:14.679 --> 1:11:17.499
I'd see you sitting in the cafe
with a babycino

1:11:17.599 --> 1:11:18.659
and I'd just panic.

1:11:18.759 --> 1:11:22.360
-Why?
-I was scared.

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:27.060
But recently, I've been given
some great advice

1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:29.860
from two very wise people.

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.380
I'm...I'm scared too.

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:36.581
-Really?
-Yes, yes.

1:11:36.681 --> 1:11:39.541
Maybe we can be scared together.

1:11:45.041 --> 1:11:46.541
- Oh!
- Yuck!

1:11:46.641 --> 1:11:48.641
Gross!

1:11:49.001 --> 1:11:52.101
I knew it. Christmas booty call.

1:11:52.201 --> 1:11:54.222
Who are you?

1:11:54.322 --> 1:11:56.422
What's a booty call?

1:12:06.922 --> 1:12:08.923
Thank you.

1:12:10.163 --> 1:12:12.103
For...for what?

1:12:12.203 --> 1:12:14.483
We didn't...
we didn't get the money.

1:12:16.003 --> 1:12:19.283
For reminding me who I was
when I'd forgotten.

1:12:20.283 --> 1:12:22.283
I'm really sorry, Pete.
This should never have happened.

1:12:23.883 --> 1:12:25.824
You're an amazing kid.

1:12:25.924 --> 1:12:27.924
And an even better brother.

1:12:28.924 --> 1:12:30.624
Merry Christmas.

1:12:30.724 --> 1:12:32.224
Where are you going?

1:12:32.324 --> 1:12:33.984
Hand myself in.

1:12:34.084 --> 1:12:35.904
-You're what?
-It's the right thing to do.

1:12:36.004 --> 1:12:38.304
No, but no-one knows!
No-one knows anything.

1:12:38.404 --> 1:12:40.945
Mr Harrington, we can pin
this whole thing on Nan.

1:12:41.045 --> 1:12:42.385
-Oh, Pete.
-Please, come on.

1:12:42.485 --> 1:12:44.265
And in the end
she did take the money,

1:12:44.365 --> 1:12:45.905
so it kinda was
a real hostage situation.

1:12:46.005 --> 1:12:48.105
Yeah, that I planned!

1:12:48.205 --> 1:12:49.705
I put us all in danger

1:12:49.805 --> 1:12:51.465
and I stole money
from my sister.

1:12:51.565 --> 1:12:54.005
- Yeah, that was...
- Then give it back.

1:12:55.405 --> 1:12:56.386
Shez.

1:12:56.486 --> 1:12:57.386
What are you doing?

1:12:57.486 --> 1:12:59.486
Hiding from the cops.

1:13:03.966 --> 1:13:05.386
This is for you.

1:13:05.486 --> 1:13:07.106
Wha...

1:13:07.206 --> 1:13:10.026
I switched it before Nan
pushed me into this pit.

1:13:10.126 --> 1:13:12.347
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you keep it?

1:13:12.447 --> 1:13:14.427
I don't know.

1:13:14.527 --> 1:13:15.627
Didn't feel right.

1:13:15.727 --> 1:13:17.727
Never does, actually.

1:13:18.647 --> 1:13:22.187
What do you say? We won't say
anything if you don't.

1:13:22.287 --> 1:13:24.547
Oi, get away
from that woman!

1:13:24.647 --> 1:13:26.907
She's the other one, yeah?

1:13:27.007 --> 1:13:29.228
No, no, this is...

1:13:29.328 --> 1:13:31.148
This is another one
of the hostages.

1:13:31.248 --> 1:13:34.028
No, I saw you. You were pushing
around the pregnant one.

1:13:34.128 --> 1:13:35.188
I saw you outside.

1:13:35.288 --> 1:13:38.548
Yes, she was forced to do that
by Nan.

1:13:38.648 --> 1:13:42.028
-Nan!
-And I have a disability.

1:13:42.128 --> 1:13:44.549
Do you really think I could
pull off a hostage situation?

1:13:44.649 --> 1:13:46.829
Pff! Didn't stop
the Rolling Assassin.

1:13:46.929 --> 1:13:49.269
13 murders
and we still can't find him.

1:13:49.369 --> 1:13:50.549
Or his wheelchair.

1:13:50.649 --> 1:13:53.229
Well, um...well,
she's also my girlfriend.

1:13:53.329 --> 1:13:55.309
Pfff! No.

1:13:55.409 --> 1:13:59.389
I mean, I didn't realise
we were official yet, babe.

1:13:59.489 --> 1:14:02.870
But yeah, I came to surprise him
at work.

1:14:02.970 --> 1:14:04.550
You... Him? You're dating him?

1:14:04.650 --> 1:14:06.670
You bet.

1:14:06.770 --> 1:14:07.950
Him?

1:14:14.330 --> 1:14:17.531
Oh. Alright, get a room.
Jeepers creepers.

1:14:20.771 --> 1:14:22.071
Well, that story checks out.

1:14:22.171 --> 1:14:24.911
Alright, um, we'll get
a statement from you.

1:14:25.011 --> 1:14:27.391
Um, uh...

1:14:27.491 --> 1:14:28.471
Enjoy your evening.

1:14:28.571 --> 1:14:30.571
See you guys later.

1:14:32.372 --> 1:14:33.792
'Bye, Sherrin.

1:14:33.892 --> 1:14:36.432
Oh!

1:14:36.532 --> 1:14:38.312
These two have just told me
that...

1:14:38.412 --> 1:14:40.432
So this is Stockholm syndrome?

1:14:40.532 --> 1:14:42.472
OK, well,
it's my understanding

1:14:42.572 --> 1:14:44.952
that these two have been living
here without a guardian.

1:14:45.052 --> 1:14:45.952
That's not true.

1:14:46.052 --> 1:14:47.792
Yeah, but Pete's our guardian.

1:14:47.892 --> 1:14:49.713
Yes, I'm the guardian.

1:14:49.813 --> 1:14:51.813
You?

1:14:52.413 --> 1:14:54.993
-How old are you, Romeo?
-I'm...nearly...

1:14:55.093 --> 1:14:57.873
Actually, they're staying
with me.

1:14:57.973 --> 1:14:58.993
I'm the guardian.

1:14:59.093 --> 1:15:00.873
Right, OK.

1:15:00.973 --> 1:15:02.073
Well, yep.

1:15:02.173 --> 1:15:03.193
What?

1:15:03.293 --> 1:15:06.074
You know, a brave young man
once told me

1:15:06.174 --> 1:15:08.214
Harringtons isn't just
a toy store...

1:15:09.534 --> 1:15:11.534
..it's a family.

1:15:12.614 --> 1:15:14.234
What do I need to sign?

1:15:14.334 --> 1:15:15.954
What, for three kids?

1:15:16.054 --> 1:15:18.454
A big cheque.

1:15:20.295 --> 1:15:21.915
Honestly, that's not really
my department,

1:15:22.015 --> 1:15:24.475
but I'll make some calls, yeah.

1:15:24.575 --> 1:15:27.475
My God, thank you,
thank you, Mr Harrington.

1:15:27.575 --> 1:15:30.335
Hey, it's the least I can do.

1:15:33.455 --> 1:15:35.555
Oh, come here, you two.

1:15:35.655 --> 1:15:38.616
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, we're great.

1:15:41.736 --> 1:15:43.956
You used to be so cute.

1:15:44.056 --> 1:15:46.056
What happened?

1:15:47.256 --> 1:15:48.876
I inherited a toy store.

1:15:52.096 --> 1:15:53.677
You know,

1:15:53.777 --> 1:15:55.857
Dad always thought you were
the family genius.

1:15:58.217 --> 1:16:01.197
He didn't leave you
out of the store, Terri.

1:16:01.297 --> 1:16:04.177
He freed you to do bigger
and better things.

1:16:06.697 --> 1:16:08.638
I mean, I never thought
you wanted it.

1:16:08.738 --> 1:16:10.858
I wanted what it meant.

1:16:12.858 --> 1:16:15.618
There's a reason my first
video game was about a toy shop.

1:16:16.858 --> 1:16:19.818
You know, Dad would have wanted
you to make this place your own.

1:16:20.858 --> 1:16:22.938
It doesn't have to be
a memorial.

1:16:31.939 --> 1:16:33.199
This is yours.

1:16:33.299 --> 1:16:34.279
What?!

1:16:34.379 --> 1:16:35.399
How?

1:16:35.499 --> 1:16:38.119
And so is the store.

1:16:38.219 --> 1:16:40.220
If you want it.

1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:44.300
Keep it.

1:16:44.660 --> 1:16:47.200
-Consider it my buy-in.
-But...

1:16:47.300 --> 1:16:48.280
You clearly need

1:16:48.380 --> 1:16:49.680
some professional guidance
around here,

1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:52.400
or someone who can negotiate,
at the very least.

1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:54.940
You know, I could be
a silent partner.

1:17:00.501 --> 1:17:01.881
You know what?

1:17:01.981 --> 1:17:03.981
I've got a better idea.

1:17:07.101 --> 1:17:09.601
Ooh-hoo, Skip.

1:17:09.701 --> 1:17:12.682
Look what we've got!

1:17:16.862 --> 1:17:18.862
What's this?

1:17:24.142 --> 1:17:28.283
Oh, Sherrin, what have you done?

1:17:28.383 --> 1:17:30.383
No!

1:17:31.263 --> 1:17:34.563
No!

1:17:38.623 --> 1:17:42.623
This isn't even the right way
to Bali!

1:17:46.224 --> 1:17:49.924
<i>And bob's your uncle -</i>
<i>the toy store was saved.</i>

1:17:50.024 --> 1:17:51.484
Ah!

1:17:51.584 --> 1:17:53.644
<i>And everything worked out well</i>
<i>in the end.</i>

1:17:53.744 --> 1:17:55.744
This one's mine.

1:17:57.384 --> 1:18:00.325
<i>Pete, Brady and Wombat's</i>
<i>off-the-grid storeroom</i>

1:18:00.425 --> 1:18:01.325
<i>got a makeover.</i>

1:18:01.425 --> 1:18:02.565
Merry Christmas!

1:18:02.665 --> 1:18:05.405
<i>And became their very own place</i>
<i>to call home.</i>

1:18:05.505 --> 1:18:07.505
<i>And it was very close</i>
<i>to Pete's work.</i>

1:18:08.985 --> 1:18:12.325
<i>Derrick knew he still had a bit</i>
<i>of making up to do,</i>

1:18:12.425 --> 1:18:16.166
<i>so he gave every member</i>
<i>of the Harrington family</i>

1:18:16.266 --> 1:18:18.266
<i>their own Christmas surprise.</i>

1:18:21.506 --> 1:18:24.926
<i>Pete got a promotion</i>
<i>to assistant store manager</i>

1:18:25.026 --> 1:18:27.886
<i>and Harringtons' resident Santa.</i>

1:18:27.986 --> 1:18:29.986
That's a big one.

1:18:32.147 --> 1:18:35.047
<i>And my girl Terri</i>
<i>became a business partner</i>

1:18:35.147 --> 1:18:37.487
<i>with her video games centrestage</i>

1:18:37.587 --> 1:18:40.287
<i>now that she was finally home.</i>

1:18:40.387 --> 1:18:42.387
..one, go!

1:18:43.027 --> 1:18:45.247
<i>You see, Derrick always thought</i>

1:18:45.347 --> 1:18:47.367
<i>that Harringtons</i>
<i>was a magical wonderland</i>

1:18:47.467 --> 1:18:49.968
<i>because of the toys</i>
<i>in the store.</i>

1:18:50.068 --> 1:18:52.608
<i>But after</i>
<i>that fateful Christmas,</i>

1:18:52.708 --> 1:18:55.088
<i>what he realised</i>
<i>was that the magic</i>

1:18:55.188 --> 1:18:58.088
<i>really came from the people</i>
<i>that he had around him,</i>

1:18:58.188 --> 1:19:01.328
<i>who loved the store</i>
<i>as much as he did.</i>

1:19:12.469 --> 1:19:14.609
<i>Because it wasn't just a store,</i>

1:19:14.709 --> 1:19:17.209
<i>it was a family</i>
<i>and it was home.</i>

1:19:17.309 --> 1:19:21.210
<i>And once he learnt that, the</i>
<i>place was never empty again.</i>

1:19:27.150 --> 1:19:28.890
Look, kid,
it's Christmas Eve.

1:19:28.990 --> 1:19:30.690
I'm feeling generous,

1:19:30.790 --> 1:19:33.290
and that is why I'm gonna let
you off with just a warning.

1:19:33.390 --> 1:19:34.490
I don't get it.

1:19:34.590 --> 1:19:36.491
Kid, we've been here
for an hour and a half.

1:19:36.591 --> 1:19:38.611
-What don't you get?
-I don't know.

1:19:38.711 --> 1:19:39.851
Oh, would you, um...

1:19:39.951 --> 1:19:42.771
would you be interested in
any of the Greg-Nog?

1:19:42.871 --> 1:19:44.251
-He's 10!
-Gross.

1:19:44.351 --> 1:19:46.971
-Oh, maybe his parents?
-Uh, not now.

1:19:47.071 --> 1:19:48.971
-OK, OK, OK. I gotta go.
-'Bye, Greginor.

1:19:49.071 --> 1:19:50.091
'Bye, little Gladdy!

1:19:50.191 --> 1:19:51.251
-Oh, 'bye!
-'Bye!

1:19:51.351 --> 1:19:54.012
-Ahhh!
-Be good for Daddy!

1:19:55.392 --> 1:19:58.092
We all make mistakes.

1:19:58.192 --> 1:20:00.772
True magic comes from people,

1:20:00.872 --> 1:20:03.092
not stealing this stethoscope.

1:20:03.192 --> 1:20:04.812
It was for a medical emergency.

1:20:04.912 --> 1:20:06.172
It's a toy!

1:20:06.272 --> 1:20:10.013
Yo, Gladdo, I caught this kid
stealing a video game.

1:20:10.113 --> 1:20:11.933
Oh! Good on you, Shez.

1:20:12.033 --> 1:20:14.033
Maybe don't pull her
by the hair, though.

1:20:14.713 --> 1:20:16.453
- Can I go now?
- No.

1:20:16.553 --> 1:20:18.253
'Cause you clearly haven't
gotten the message.

1:20:18.353 --> 1:20:21.053
Alright, sit down and shut up.

1:20:21.153 --> 1:20:22.773
Are you ready?

1:20:22.873 --> 1:20:26.914
Good, because I'm about to
tell you a story.

1:20:41.915 --> 1:20:43.295
Pete!

1:20:45.355 --> 1:20:47.855
He never even got to learn
how to stocktake!

1:20:50.075 --> 1:20:51.295
Same thing, but hotter.

1:20:51.395 --> 1:20:53.335
Like, cough sexy.

1:20:56.516 --> 1:20:58.816
Maybe let's not cough at all.
It's a bit COVID vibe.

1:20:58.916 --> 1:20:59.816
Alright.

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:06.016
I need immediate assistance
in locating me a hot chocky.

1:21:09.076 --> 1:21:11.296
Yummy.

1:21:22.837 --> 1:21:24.537
Oh!

1:21:24.637 --> 1:21:25.577
You good?

1:21:25.677 --> 1:21:28.338
Yeah.

1:21:30.398 --> 1:21:33.298
Is this a ransom, or, like,
a blue light disco?

1:21:39.638 --> 1:21:41.418
I don't know the words.

1:21:41.518 --> 1:21:42.418
Sorry.

1:21:44.439 --> 1:21:46.379
- Save yourself!
- Oh, OK. OK.

1:21:46.479 --> 1:21:48.859
Save yourself! Go!

1:21:48.959 --> 1:21:49.899
Go!

1:21:49.999 --> 1:21:51.899
Oh, no, take me too! Come back!

1:21:51.999 --> 1:21:53.179
Arggh!

1:21:53.279 --> 1:21:54.779
Arggh, that hurts so much!

1:21:56.879 --> 1:21:58.379
It's unfair.

1:21:58.479 --> 1:21:59.500
Life's unfair.

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:01.020
Your face is unfair.

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:06.340
That is a banger.

1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:08.100
I'm just sayin'.

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:09.340
-It is pretty catchy.
-It is.

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:11.440
It's a ransom...

1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.661
Let go of her!

1:22:15.761 --> 1:22:17.101
Ohhh!

1:22:35.722 --> 1:22:38.862
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

1:22:42.842 --> 1:22:45.102
Aroo!

1:22:45.202 --> 1:22:47.142
So this is what it means
to die hard.

1:22:47.242 --> 1:22:50.263
So this is what
it means to die hard!

1:22:50.363 --> 1:22:53.223
So this is what it means
to die hard.
