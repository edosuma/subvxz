01:10.271 --> 01:12.172
All right,
everybody listen up!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.641
Everybody knows what time it is!

01:14.642 --> 01:16.509
All the belongings
in the bag.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.145
Good work, Handsome.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.548
Handsome regulates
the neighborhood!

01:21.549 --> 01:24.718
If you want to ride
my train, you pay my toll.

01:24.719 --> 01:27.354
Turn around! Turn around!
Let me get your watch!

01:27.355 --> 01:29.089
Turn around!
Turn around!

01:29.090 --> 01:30.757
(groaning)

(gunshots)

01:51.846 --> 01:54.014
(plastic creaks, cracks)

01:54.615 --> 01:55.849
HENRY:
Don't force it.

01:55.850 --> 01:56.950
I'm not forcing it.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.819
It says a ten-year-old
can assemble this thing.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.855
I bet your wife
could assemble it.

02:01.856 --> 02:04.357
Dad, why don't you give
me hand here, please?

02:04.358 --> 02:07.260
You need a degree in mechanical
engineering for that.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.828
No kidding.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.398
FRANK:
How'd it go?

02:11.399 --> 02:14.267
Aha! My favorite
granddaughter.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.368
Your only granddaughter.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.203
Oh, you still playing
with toys, Danny?

02:17.204 --> 02:19.372
That's cute.
It's for my son's birthday.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.674
Well, if Mom were still
alive, she'd tell you

02:21.675 --> 02:23.076
that was beyond your skill set.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.377
DANNY: That's funny.
Ha, ha, ha.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.512
Wanna help?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.281
Hey, the whole
gang's here.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.149
Hey, Jamie.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.150
Hey, will you help me

02:30.151 --> 02:31.051
out here, college boy?

02:31.052 --> 02:32.218
You're pathetic.

02:32.219 --> 02:35.388
It says it's supposed
to lock in.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.257
Let me see this.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.164
Glad you came over.
You okay?

02:44.165 --> 02:45.131
Yeah. Fine.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.299
Boy, that's a relief.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.934
'Cause if I were
going through a divorce

02:47.935 --> 02:50.003
and my kid went on a
long trip with her father,

02:50.004 --> 02:51.237
and I had
to say goodbye,

02:51.238 --> 02:53.373
I wouldn't be fine.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.308
I'll have a scotch.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.980
She's just so happy about it.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.183
Is it a nice trip?

03:03.184 --> 03:04.651
Yeah. He's taking her
to San Francisco.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.152
But he doesn't even
like San Francisco.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.454
Sounds like a nice trip.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.589
(phone rings)

03:12.660 --> 03:14.227
Hold that thought.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.962
Yeah?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.131
What, when, and where?

03:18.132 --> 03:19.666
(phone buzzing)

03:19.667 --> 03:21.067
Oh, those damn things.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.102
Reagan.

03:22.103 --> 03:23.303
JAMIE: This is starting
to hurt my head.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.237
Yeah. Hey, you're gonna have

03:24.238 --> 03:25.438
to finish that on your own.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.907
Hey, I gotta work--
I gotta work at midnight.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.042
I'm supposed to leave
five minutes ago.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.211
See you Sunday, Grandpa.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.413
First platoon.
A rookie's lot.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.715
Yeah, I understand.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.585
I want regular updates, I want a
breakdown of all the injuries,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.320
and I want to know
who's assigned...

03:40.321 --> 03:42.555
Hey.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.791
Hey, a little
help here!

03:47.361 --> 03:49.596
(distant sirens wailing,
indistinct chatter)

03:52.766 --> 03:54.134
Hey.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.039
What do we got?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.609
Six perps, box cutters
and knives, one gun, one camera.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.978
We're still sorting out
the specifics of the mayhem.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.079
What's with the camera?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.747
They were recording
everything.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.048
It's a good
conversation piece.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.217
Break out the wilding video
at your dinner party.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.452
Who pulled the cord?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.653
Passengers
in the next car.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.588
They heard the gunshots,
saw what was happening

04:15.589 --> 04:17.724
through the storm windows,
did the right thing.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.125
Everybody scrambles
to the platform.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.861
Looks like from the blood,
they might have, uh, fled down

04:21.862 --> 04:23.196
to the tracks.
Yeah, I know.

04:23.197 --> 04:24.864
Clerks didn't see 'em
go out either exit.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.200
Got uniforms covering
two stations-- north and south.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.802
ESU and Canine are en route
to sweep the tunnels.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.438
A lot of blood.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.241
AVA: Yeah. We still don't
know why the shooting started

04:35.242 --> 04:36.509
or where the
bullets went.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.911
Recovered two
casings from a nine,

04:37.912 --> 04:40.146
and I got anti-crime
canvassing the hospitals.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.882
No passengers were shot,
as far as we know.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.951
Hey, where you going?

04:44.952 --> 04:48.254
I'm gonna go make myself useful.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.322
(sirens wailing)

04:49.323 --> 04:52.292
JAMIE:
Hey, Danny!

04:52.293 --> 04:54.060
Hey! Little brother!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.395
What are you
doing here?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.564
We got a prisoner
drop-off at the six-five.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.899
Yeah, thought I'd show the
rookie what a caper looks like.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.068
Bunch of cops rubbernecking,
looking to poach a collar, huh?

05:02.069 --> 05:04.304
Nah. Hey, my partner's gonna
be down there for a while.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.573
She's got the car keys.
You guys mind giving me a ride?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.374
Yeah, where to?
To the two train.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.742
It's got an emergency
exit over there,

05:09.743 --> 05:11.211
near the playground
between Beverly and Church.

05:11.212 --> 05:12.345
Just gonna make sure
it's not popped.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.713
JAMIE:
You think that's how

05:13.714 --> 05:15.081
they got out of the tunnel?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.449
Uh-huh.
All right, come on.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.117
Get in.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.988
So, Sarge, you taking good care
of my little brother?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.557
Yup. First thing I told him was
to imagine what you'd do,

05:24.558 --> 05:25.692
and then do the opposite.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.726
Wow. That's good advice.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.894
Now, if you just go straight

05:27.895 --> 05:28.928
on Nostrand,
we'll get there quicker.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.163
Hey, college boy,

05:30.164 --> 05:32.398
tell your brother the first rule
of riding in my car.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.167
Jamie, tell your boss
I know Brooklyn

05:34.168 --> 05:35.568
better than a Manhattan cop.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.470
This is me, keeping
my mouth shut.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.972
See? He's already
doing the opposite.

05:38.973 --> 05:40.873
That a boy, kid.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.175
He's learning quick.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.444
Son of a bitch!

05:44.445 --> 05:48.281
DANNY: <i>Looks like they popped</i>
<i>the subway hatch. Stop the car.</i>

05:52.353 --> 05:53.853
They're already
out of the tunnel.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.655
Hey, I got blood.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.023
DANNY:
It's not footprints, either.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.258
Somebody must be hurt.

05:58.259 --> 05:59.659
Hey, slow down, kid.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.028
12 sergeant, need
a 10-85 forthwith

06:02.029 --> 06:03.229
at Nostrand
and Tilden.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.198
Hey, kid.
I'm the lead.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.733
Hey!

06:06.734 --> 06:09.002
Police! Let me see your hands.

06:09.003 --> 06:11.704
Let me see
your hands!

06:11.705 --> 06:13.873
Put your hands in front!

06:16.744 --> 06:19.345
Hands up!

06:19.346 --> 06:21.147
Hey.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.691
RENZULLI: This guy's gone.
Looks like he bled out

06:31.692 --> 06:33.026
from under the stomach.
Yeah.

06:33.027 --> 06:34.827
RENZULLI:
Buddies left him behind.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.995
They left him to die.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.698
Says a lot about who
we're dealing with.

Chief Jeffords
from Brooklyn South

07:21.725 --> 07:23.437
is waiting for you in
the conference room.

07:23.438 --> 07:26.373
Bronx Homicide made two arrests
in last week's club shooting.

07:26.374 --> 07:28.142
Report's on your desk.
Report's on my desk?

07:28.143 --> 07:29.843
There was another
home invasion in Woodside.

07:29.844 --> 07:32.279
Have the precinct commander
here by noon to explain why.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.315
Will do, Commissioner.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.051
Train robbery?

07:37.052 --> 07:41.040
Six perps-- male white,
black and Hispanic.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.442
Multiethnic gang.

07:42.443 --> 07:43.397
Ages 16 to 20.

07:43.398 --> 07:45.413
The leader had a 9mm pistol.

07:45.414 --> 07:47.548
Witnesses have
conflicting stories.

07:47.549 --> 07:50.751
No one is sure why
he opened fire, or at who.

07:50.752 --> 07:52.119
But you have a dead perp.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.289
Lee Cranston-- no arrests,
no gang affiliations.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.524
We're waiting on ballistics.

07:56.525 --> 07:59.594
Our one theory is, uh,
he was being tried out,

07:59.595 --> 08:01.462
did something wrong,
they shot him.

08:01.463 --> 08:03.864
But you have a better
theory, Mike. (chuckles)

08:03.865 --> 08:05.132
An accident.

08:05.133 --> 08:08.536
The leader got excited,
popped off a few shots,

08:08.537 --> 08:09.937
did us a favor.

08:12.307 --> 08:15.276
Two witnesses I.D.'d
the leader as Steven Jackson.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.844
Street name: Handsome.

08:16.845 --> 08:18.079
He's still at large.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.048
Transit detectives like him
for three other robberies

08:21.049 --> 08:24.518
on the number two line
in Flatbush in the last month.

08:24.519 --> 08:27.288
Not just robbery.
Rape, aggravated assault...

08:27.289 --> 08:29.290
It isn't just about the money
with this kid.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.359
He gets off
on the violence.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.427
I mean, controlling
a trainload of people.

08:33.428 --> 08:35.529
He's got the whole
neighborhood terrorized.

08:35.530 --> 08:39.000
Oh-- the camera
is a new twist.

08:39.001 --> 08:41.469
And the gun, an escalation.

08:41.470 --> 08:44.538
Why the hell has he
had time to escalate?

08:44.539 --> 08:48.476
We're staked out on his mom's
apartment; his girlfriend;

08:48.477 --> 08:52.580
we even reached out to Newark PD
to sit on his cousin's house.

08:52.581 --> 08:54.849
The last four weeks,

08:54.850 --> 08:56.684
he's been a ghost.

08:56.685 --> 08:58.686
And the perps?
No I.D.s yet.

08:58.687 --> 09:01.622
We've arrested 12 of his crew
off of the previous complaints.

09:01.623 --> 09:03.357
But we take two
off the street,

09:03.358 --> 09:05.192
Handsome recruits two more.

09:05.193 --> 09:07.762
Transit Bureau triples coverage
on every two line station

09:07.763 --> 09:09.730
from Atlantic to Flatbush,

09:09.731 --> 09:12.967
cop on every train, extra
patrol coverage in Flatbush.

09:12.968 --> 09:14.935
I want the community to know
we're there for them.

09:14.936 --> 09:16.604
Mm-hmm. Okay.

09:21.643 --> 09:23.077
(clears throat)

09:23.078 --> 09:25.079
AVA: Okay, after they
started robbing people,

09:25.080 --> 09:26.414
what happened next?

09:26.415 --> 09:27.848
MAN: I don't know.
One of the guys--

09:27.849 --> 09:29.684
he had his knee on my
head the whole time.

09:29.685 --> 09:31.686
There was yelling.

09:31.687 --> 09:33.020
Then I heard shots.

09:33.021 --> 09:36.357
When he took his knee
off of your head,

09:36.358 --> 09:38.459
did you see any faces?
No, no.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.960
I didn't get up
for a while,

09:39.961 --> 09:41.462
and then when I did,
they were gone.

09:41.463 --> 09:43.964
And when you got up,
did you see anyone hurt,

09:43.965 --> 09:45.232
anyone running?

09:45.233 --> 09:47.468
MAN: Yeah, I mean, a few of us
were pretty scared...

09:47.469 --> 09:49.236
Excuse me, miss.
You being helped?

09:49.237 --> 09:51.172
They said to wait
for Detective Hutchins.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.807
Hotchkiss.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.642
You related to
Lee Cranston?

09:54.643 --> 09:55.943
He was my cousin.

09:55.944 --> 09:57.645
How'd you know?

09:57.646 --> 09:59.747
I know what family looks like.

10:01.149 --> 10:03.484
Why don't you
come on with me?

10:06.054 --> 10:07.588
Right in here.

10:07.589 --> 10:10.257
It's okay.
You can sit right there.

10:13.895 --> 10:16.263
So, you saw the news
last night?

10:17.232 --> 10:19.500
You know Lee was
robbing people.

10:21.470 --> 10:24.171
People on the train said
Handsome fired some shots.

10:24.172 --> 10:25.473
Do you know Handsome?

10:25.474 --> 10:27.041
Everybody knows
who he is.

10:27.042 --> 10:29.877
Well, from what I hear,
Lee was a good kid.

10:29.878 --> 10:31.846
Never got in trouble
with the cops.

10:31.847 --> 10:33.514
Yeah.

10:33.515 --> 10:35.883
So how he ends up
robbing a train last night,

10:35.884 --> 10:38.285
I have no idea. Do you?

10:40.322 --> 10:44.558
Do you know any of the other
boys on the train, Denise?

10:44.559 --> 10:46.293
No.

10:46.294 --> 10:48.229
Denise, what
I'm getting at is,

10:48.230 --> 10:51.098
that it was probably Handsome
who shot Lee.

10:51.099 --> 10:53.067
And even if Handsome
didn't shoot him,

10:53.068 --> 10:55.102
he left him on a park bench
to bleed to death.

10:55.103 --> 10:56.437
Are you okay with that?

10:57.305 --> 10:59.940
Handsome and his boys...

10:59.941 --> 11:02.243
You don't know
what it's like.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.979
He owns Flatbush.

11:04.980 --> 11:08.716
People are scared to ride
on the train at night

11:08.717 --> 11:12.586
and nobody knows where he's
going to show up and...

11:12.587 --> 11:16.157
everybody knows you
can't catch him.

11:16.158 --> 11:20.394
Yeah, that's why we need
help, Denise.

11:21.296 --> 11:23.364
So here's the thing.

11:23.365 --> 11:25.900
The way I knew
you were here for Lee--

11:25.901 --> 11:29.103
you looked like someone
who was feeling real loss.

11:34.142 --> 11:36.277
(sniffling)

11:36.278 --> 11:38.445
Can I go?

11:41.750 --> 11:43.751
Tell you what.

11:43.752 --> 11:46.387
When you think about it
and you decide

11:46.388 --> 11:50.491
that Lee deserves
what you can do for him...

11:50.492 --> 11:52.693
I'll be on the other end
of the phone.

12:00.969 --> 12:02.870
(sighs)

12:02.871 --> 12:06.574
When you said you were
buying breakfast-- thanks.

12:06.575 --> 12:07.575
You're welcome.
Rookie salary.

12:07.576 --> 12:10.611
Plus, I got grand jury
in 20 minutes.

12:10.612 --> 12:13.247
So how you liking
the other side?

12:13.248 --> 12:15.716
I didn't realize cops and
D.A.s were on opposite sides.

12:15.717 --> 12:18.052
Oh, wait until I tell you
your collar won't hold up

12:18.053 --> 12:19.887
and decline prosecution.

12:19.888 --> 12:21.922
You'd do that to me?
My own sister.

12:21.923 --> 12:24.024
Opposite sides.

12:24.025 --> 12:25.926
Any good
war stories?

12:25.927 --> 12:28.262
Renzulli says
I can't tell war stories

12:28.263 --> 12:30.331
till my second partner.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.499
Saw my first dead body
last night.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.436
And, of course, Danny had to be
the one to show it to me.

12:35.437 --> 12:36.871
He found it, in fact.

12:36.872 --> 12:39.607
If you were 12, he would
have made you kiss it.

12:40.876 --> 12:43.544
Are you okay?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.646
Yeah. Why?

12:45.647 --> 12:48.682
Because everything's
not okay.

12:48.683 --> 12:50.117
Problems with Sydney?

12:50.118 --> 12:52.453
It's an adjustment.

12:52.454 --> 12:54.688
We're... adjusting.

12:54.689 --> 12:57.691
I threw her
a big curveball.

12:57.692 --> 12:58.792
Get engaged to a lawyer,

12:58.793 --> 13:00.461
suddenly you're looking
at marrying a cop.

13:00.462 --> 13:01.896
In spite of what
the priests say,

13:01.897 --> 13:02.997
marriage isn't
a contract,

13:02.998 --> 13:06.200
it's an ongoing
negotiation.

13:06.201 --> 13:07.868
Yeah.

13:07.869 --> 13:11.705
Not that I know anything
about marriage, right?

13:11.706 --> 13:14.141
John had everyone fooled,

13:14.142 --> 13:17.745
except for maybe
Dad... and Danny.

13:17.746 --> 13:18.846
And Grandpa.

13:18.847 --> 13:20.414
Okay, so he had me fooled.

13:20.415 --> 13:21.515
(laughs)

13:21.516 --> 13:23.250
Yeah.

13:27.622 --> 13:29.356
M.E. pulled a .38
out of Lee Cranston.

13:29.357 --> 13:30.791
Handsome was shooting
a nine.

13:30.792 --> 13:31.725
There was a second gun?

13:31.726 --> 13:32.860
We're waiting
on ballistics.

13:32.861 --> 13:34.028
It was a stomach wound.

13:34.029 --> 13:36.096
Could be that Lee had a
gun, was pulling it out,

13:36.097 --> 13:37.264
accidentally
shot himself.

13:37.265 --> 13:39.199
Then Handsome reacts
to the gunfire.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.701
We recovered two of his
nine-millimeter slugs

13:40.702 --> 13:41.869
from one of
the seats.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.504
Lee Cranston shoots himself
and no one sees?

13:43.505 --> 13:45.773
Half the vics are
on the ground,

13:45.774 --> 13:47.308
the other half are getting
roughed up and robbed.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.143
It's their instinct to try
not to make eye contact.

13:49.144 --> 13:50.311
Or could be maybe

13:50.312 --> 13:52.479
one of the other perps had
a reason to shoot Lee

13:52.480 --> 13:54.114
or maybe one of the vics
had a gun, too.

13:54.115 --> 13:55.649
Lot of maybes.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.451
I still have two
vics to interview.

13:57.452 --> 13:58.519
Patrol got their
information,

13:58.520 --> 13:59.954
but they left the scene
before we got there.

13:59.955 --> 14:01.922
What about the
other four perps?

14:01.923 --> 14:03.390
No I.D.s, no
known associates?

14:03.391 --> 14:04.491
The 6-5 picked up
every kid

14:04.492 --> 14:07.027
involved
in the previous robberies.

14:07.028 --> 14:09.263
I think Handsome just crewed up
with all new mopes.

14:09.264 --> 14:11.832
Explains what a marshmallow like
Lee Cranston was doing with him.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.500
AVA: Handsome is out there
somewhere, boss.

14:13.501 --> 14:15.035
I could use some more bodies.
You've got Reagan.

14:15.036 --> 14:16.637
He's worth four
of us mere mortals.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.939
Three.
Three, anyway, Sarge.

14:20.075 --> 14:22.876
(indistinct shouting
and yelling on video)

14:24.312 --> 14:26.246
Intel came across this

14:26.247 --> 14:28.015
doing one of their
periodic data mines

14:28.016 --> 14:30.150
at one of the known
gang Web sites.

14:30.151 --> 14:33.387
Mostly it's disses
of other gangs and bad poetry.

14:33.388 --> 14:35.689
You get some special mentions.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.191
Must be doing
my job right.

14:37.192 --> 14:38.892
Who put this
up, Jennings?

14:38.893 --> 14:40.627
It's an anonymous
Internet tag.

14:40.628 --> 14:43.530
I want you to say hello
to all the folks at home.

14:43.531 --> 14:45.466
Wave, say hi.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.500
Hi.

14:46.501 --> 14:48.102
Kid likes to see
himself on camera.

14:48.103 --> 14:51.472
If they were smarter, it would
take us longer to catch them.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.640
This is how I manage it.

14:54.809 --> 14:56.677
It's like my old man
always says:

14:56.678 --> 14:58.345
if they were smart,
we'd never catch them.

14:58.346 --> 15:01.582
Pull some stills of the video
and start canvassing Flatbush.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.350
Put together some
photo arrays.

15:03.351 --> 15:06.820
And then the Spanish one took
my purse and the, uh,

15:06.821 --> 15:09.089
one in the red shirt
with the knife--

15:09.090 --> 15:10.624
he said they should rape me.

15:10.625 --> 15:11.525
That's what he said?
Yeah.

15:11.526 --> 15:12.559
Maybe it was
the Spanish one.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.795
I was scared, but then
another one said no

15:14.796 --> 15:16.463
and then one of them
grabbed my arm.

15:16.464 --> 15:18.799
That's when the man sitting
next to me shot them.

15:21.536 --> 15:22.603
You saw the shooting?

15:22.604 --> 15:24.972
Yeah, well, he put
his hands in his pockets

15:24.973 --> 15:27.474
and I heard gunshots
and saw smoke.

15:27.475 --> 15:28.876
Can you tell me what
this guy looks like?

15:28.877 --> 15:30.144
You know what?
I think she should

15:30.145 --> 15:31.445
take a look at this over here.

15:31.446 --> 15:33.213
All right, let's go.

15:35.050 --> 15:37.284
Okay, I'm gonna play
this video quarter speed.

15:37.285 --> 15:39.486
You tell me
if you recognize anyone.

15:41.289 --> 15:43.624
WOMAN: Yeah, right
there-- stop, stop.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.592
This guy?
You sure that's him?

15:45.593 --> 15:46.660
Yeah.
Do you know

15:46.661 --> 15:47.861
when he got on?
Yeah, 42nd,

15:47.862 --> 15:48.896
same as me.

15:48.897 --> 15:50.030
Did he say anything to you?

15:50.031 --> 15:51.532
Did he know the guys
who attacked you?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.867
He was as scared
as the rest of us.

15:53.868 --> 15:55.969
A Good Samaritan
shooter.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.771
Imagine that.

15:57.772 --> 16:00.340
WOMAN: Yeah, well, I wish
he'd shot all of 'em.

16:05.970 --> 16:08.505
JEFFORDS: We've reinterviewed
the passengers.

16:08.506 --> 16:11.775
A few remember seeing him, but
none of them know who he is.

16:11.776 --> 16:14.077
FRANK: And the squads?
Nothing.

16:17.315 --> 16:19.216
Work boots are scuffed,

16:19.217 --> 16:21.351
gloves in his
pants pockets.

16:21.352 --> 16:22.886
Jacket's worn,
couple years old.

16:22.887 --> 16:24.554
JEFFORDS:
Construction maybe?

16:24.555 --> 16:27.958
FRANK: <i>Daily News</i> turned to the
sports section, wedding ring.

16:30.795 --> 16:33.496
He doesn't look down or away.

16:33.497 --> 16:35.365
He slides forward
in his seat.

16:35.366 --> 16:38.969
His instincts are to protect
the woman sitting next to him.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.770
This man has a family and a job.

16:40.771 --> 16:42.706
People know him,
people like him.

16:42.707 --> 16:43.940
Give his picture
to the press.

16:43.941 --> 16:45.442
Somebody
will recognize him.

16:45.443 --> 16:49.112
Great! Then we get to lock
him up for stopping a rape.

16:50.681 --> 16:54.217
See if you can shut
down this Web site.

16:54.218 --> 16:55.986
Handsome put himself
on the Internet

16:55.987 --> 16:57.487
to get attention.

16:57.488 --> 16:59.322
Let's make sure we don't give
him any more than we have to.

16:59.323 --> 17:00.690
Well, the reporters are
going to want to know

17:00.691 --> 17:01.758
where the picture
came from,

17:01.759 --> 17:03.059
and even if we
don't tell them,

17:03.060 --> 17:04.961
they're gonna find the
video sooner or later.

17:04.962 --> 17:07.998
I'm all right with later.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.599
DANNY: These are the best
stills from the robbery video.

17:14.105 --> 17:15.472
Not much
on the other perps, huh?

17:15.473 --> 17:18.407
No, Handsome made sure the
camera was on Handsome.

17:18.409 --> 17:19.910
Meanwhile, 15 people
on the train,

17:19.911 --> 17:22.012
and only one sees the
Samaritan shoot Lee Cranston.

17:22.012 --> 17:26.049
Reagan, Hotchkiss,
check this out.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.218
REPORTER:
It was a stunning scene

17:28.219 --> 17:31.121
just 20 minutes ago
at the 65th Precinct,

17:31.122 --> 17:33.556
as Oliver Young,
known only to the police

17:33.557 --> 17:34.724
as the Subway Samaritan,

17:34.725 --> 17:36.960
surrendered himself
to reporter Kelly Davidson.

17:36.961 --> 17:38.461
You'll hear Kelly's account

17:38.462 --> 17:42.699
and an exclusive interview
with the Samaritan here.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.769
What kind of guy surrenders
to a TV reporter?

17:45.770 --> 17:47.203
The 21st century kind.

17:47.204 --> 17:48.438
Get him out
of the 65

17:48.439 --> 17:50.573
before the whole damn
neighborhood shows up

17:50.574 --> 17:51.708
to coronate him.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.243
(OLIVER over TV)
I'm convinced that,

17:53.244 --> 17:54.945
that somebody was going
to get killed.

17:54.946 --> 17:57.113
I just hope
that everyone understands that

17:57.114 --> 17:59.416
I did what I felt was,
was right.

17:59.417 --> 18:01.785
Well, I-I can't say
that anyone in your position

18:01.786 --> 18:02.919
would have done that,

18:02.920 --> 18:05.655
but we are very, very thankful
that Oliver did.

18:05.656 --> 18:08.959
Thank you so much
for sharing this with us.

18:08.960 --> 18:12.495
I'm Kelly Davidson,
Channel 10 News.

18:12.496 --> 18:14.998
(TV ANCHOR) And that was
exclusive coverage...

18:17.635 --> 18:19.703
(WOMAN over phone)
Hey.

18:19.704 --> 18:21.371
I just saw you on TV.

18:21.372 --> 18:22.405
Aw.

18:22.406 --> 18:23.707
Was I squinting?

18:23.708 --> 18:25.308
'Cause I had to look
into the sun.

18:25.309 --> 18:27.677
Your eyes were crystal clear.

18:27.678 --> 18:29.546
I want to see you.

18:29.547 --> 18:32.048
Yeah, I can move things around.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.085
Me, too.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.655
(sighs)

18:38.656 --> 18:42.225
I was doing drywall work
in Queens--

18:42.226 --> 18:46.629
a restaurant-- after hours
mostly, off the books.

18:46.630 --> 18:48.999
I've been held up twice
on my way home.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.368
I can't afford to lose the cash
I've been making.

18:51.369 --> 18:53.269
The gun was for protection.
Yeah.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.304
Where'd you get it?

18:54.305 --> 18:56.506
I'd rather not say.

18:56.507 --> 18:57.741
DANNY:
Come on, Oliver, you got

18:57.742 --> 18:59.576
to give us something more
than half of New York

18:59.577 --> 19:00.810
already heard from you
and Kelly Davidson.

19:00.811 --> 19:02.112
LAWYER:
Mr. Young is talking

19:02.113 --> 19:05.382
to you voluntarily and against
the advice of counsel.

19:05.383 --> 19:07.283
I'd recommend you
not press him.

19:07.284 --> 19:08.585
I'm not pressing
him, Counselor.

19:08.586 --> 19:10.020
You were on the train...

19:10.021 --> 19:11.654
I wasn't going
to do anything.

19:11.655 --> 19:14.691
That one had a gun, and I knew
it was going to get bad,

19:14.692 --> 19:18.094
but then they started
getting mean, hurting people,

19:18.095 --> 19:21.898
laughing about it, and they were
serious about hurting that girl.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.501
That's when you shot him.
Someone had to stop it,

19:24.502 --> 19:27.504
and then everyone started
running, and I...

19:29.373 --> 19:33.309
I've got a robbery arrest
from when I was 18,

19:33.310 --> 19:35.912
so I know what it means
that I was carrying that gun.

19:35.913 --> 19:39.983
But I haven't done a wrong
thing since that arrest.

19:39.984 --> 19:43.319
I've got a life, a family.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.423
And then I heard
that boy I shot died and...

19:46.424 --> 19:49.325
Oliver, I'm going to tell
you one more time: stop.

19:49.326 --> 19:51.628
I wasn't...
I was already thinking

19:51.629 --> 19:53.196
about turning
myself in,

19:53.197 --> 19:55.398
and then I saw
that picture in the paper.

19:55.399 --> 19:57.967
My wife saw it, too.

19:57.968 --> 20:01.137
I didn't want you people
kicking in my door,

20:01.138 --> 20:02.772
dragging me away
in front of my son.

20:02.773 --> 20:03.807
AVA:
So you called the news?

20:03.808 --> 20:05.608
Kelly Davidson
seems good on TV.

20:05.609 --> 20:08.845
I figured that way at least I'd
get my side of the story out.

20:08.846 --> 20:10.146
DANNY:
Wait a minute.

20:10.147 --> 20:11.081
You didn't think
we would listen

20:11.082 --> 20:12.615
to your side
of the story?

20:16.987 --> 20:19.089
How'd you do?

20:19.090 --> 20:20.657
AVA: Nothing he didn't
say on Channel 10.

20:20.658 --> 20:22.325
Well, except for the part

20:22.326 --> 20:23.593
about him not
trusting the cops

20:23.594 --> 20:24.861
to give him a
fair listen.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.096
AVA: He says
he tossed the gun,

20:26.097 --> 20:27.797
but between the confession
and the video,

20:27.798 --> 20:29.132
we got our case.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.402
Reagan processes the Samaritan,
you get back to the robbery.

20:32.403 --> 20:33.436
Sure thing, Sarge.

20:33.437 --> 20:34.804
(clears throat)

20:34.805 --> 20:37.540
Reagan.

20:37.541 --> 20:39.476
Let's get this punk
Handsome by the book, huh?

20:45.149 --> 20:46.983
That's Young's wife--
she's been waiting out there

20:46.984 --> 20:49.486
for hours to
talk to him.

20:49.487 --> 20:52.055
Poor bastard is going to do
time for doing the right thing

20:52.056 --> 20:54.491
with the wrong gun.

20:54.492 --> 20:57.527
Detective, some kid outside
wants to talk to you.

20:57.528 --> 20:59.496
Yeah. Said she doesn't want
to come in again.

20:59.497 --> 21:01.431
Again?

21:02.266 --> 21:04.701
I saw that guy
on the news,

21:04.702 --> 21:06.236
talking
about shooting Lee.

21:06.237 --> 21:08.938
Yeah, Denise, you know...
No, no, look,

21:08.939 --> 21:11.174
I don't blame him
for what happened.

21:11.175 --> 21:14.410
He was standing up to Handsome
even though he was afraid.

21:14.411 --> 21:17.614
I thought about that and
I thought about what you said.

21:17.615 --> 21:20.517
Lee didn't even want
to run with them.

21:20.518 --> 21:21.651
Why did he?

21:21.652 --> 21:23.887
Bunch of Handsome's crew
got locked up,

21:23.888 --> 21:26.256
so he started jumping in
new blood.

21:26.257 --> 21:27.790
Right.
Why Lee, though?

21:27.791 --> 21:32.362
Denise, come on,
why'd they pick on Lee?

21:32.363 --> 21:35.698
Lee's friend Dante
started up with them.

21:35.699 --> 21:37.634
Lee was afraid to say no.

21:37.635 --> 21:38.868
You know, another boy said no

21:38.869 --> 21:40.537
and they put him
in the hospital.

21:40.538 --> 21:42.839
Lee went up to the Bronx
to stay with our aunt,

21:42.840 --> 21:45.008
but they found him.

21:45.009 --> 21:47.944
Said he had to join up since
he knew that Dante was in it.

21:47.945 --> 21:49.445
Okay, who is this Dante guy?

21:49.446 --> 21:50.780
Dante Vandos.

21:50.781 --> 21:53.983
I used to go with him
before he got all crazy.

21:53.984 --> 21:55.418
It wasn't right.

21:55.419 --> 21:57.720
They could've taken him
to a hospital.

21:57.721 --> 21:59.689
Denise, do you know
where we can find Dante

21:59.690 --> 22:01.824
and Handsome
and his crew?

22:01.825 --> 22:05.361
I know where
all those boys stay.

22:14.205 --> 22:17.473
(hip-hop music
playing in distance)

22:29.820 --> 22:32.255
(hip-hop music playing)

22:33.257 --> 22:34.824
(indistinct chatter)

22:42.833 --> 22:45.368
(hip-hop music continues)

22:48.806 --> 22:50.240
Get down!
Get on the ground!

22:50.241 --> 22:51.774
Down on
your knees!

22:51.775 --> 22:53.243
Hands up!

22:53.244 --> 22:54.777
Hands on
your head!

22:57.114 --> 22:58.248
AVA:
Police! Freeze!

22:58.249 --> 23:00.116
Hold it, punk!

23:03.387 --> 23:05.288
AVA:
Freeze! Right there!

23:05.289 --> 23:07.223
(grunting)
Get on your face!

23:07.224 --> 23:08.758
Turn around! Turn around!
Get on your face!

23:08.759 --> 23:10.226
Hands!

23:10.227 --> 23:11.961
Don't even think about moving!
Hey, hey! Shut up!

23:11.962 --> 23:13.563
Don't move.

23:13.564 --> 23:15.832
Please tell me you got
Handsome down there.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.500
He's not down there.

23:17.501 --> 23:18.801
(sighs)

23:18.802 --> 23:20.403
Great.

23:25.584 --> 23:28.019
DANNY: <i>Come on, Dante,</i>
<i>do yourself a favor here.</i>

23:28.020 --> 23:30.688
Even if I knew where he was...

23:30.689 --> 23:32.390
I still wouldn't tell you.

23:32.391 --> 23:34.392
AVA: You figure Handsome's
gonna take care of you?

23:34.393 --> 23:35.593
His last crew
is sitting

23:35.594 --> 23:37.328
in Rikers
thinking the same thing.

23:37.329 --> 23:39.630
You don't rat on a man
with Handsome's stature.

23:39.631 --> 23:41.499
Stature.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.302
Handsome has profile
with half the gangs in the city.

23:44.303 --> 23:46.437
This is not someone
you want after you.

23:46.438 --> 23:49.140
Matter of fact,
can I have my lawyer now?

23:51.743 --> 23:54.111
(church bells tolling)

23:54.112 --> 23:57.548
I'm just saying that if people
were allowed to carry guns,

23:57.549 --> 24:00.051
maybe these animals would
give it a second thought

24:00.052 --> 24:01.185
before they
robbed a train.

24:01.186 --> 24:03.020
If everyone on the train
had a gun,

24:03.021 --> 24:05.456
then maybe more people
would have gotten killed.

24:05.457 --> 24:07.224
I don't mean
<i>everyone</i> has a gun.

24:07.225 --> 24:08.426
You have guns,
right, Grandpa?

24:08.427 --> 24:09.360
I'm a cop, Jack.

24:09.361 --> 24:10.361
DANNY:
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

24:10.362 --> 24:12.129
Hi, babe.
Hi.

24:12.130 --> 24:14.065
Had to finish up a collar.
Here's my backup.

24:14.066 --> 24:15.766
Plate's in
the kitchen.

24:15.767 --> 24:17.601
No shoptalk
while he eats.

24:17.602 --> 24:19.070
Erin, what do
you hear from Nicky?

24:19.071 --> 24:19.971
Bad question.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.139
ERIN:
Having the time of her life.

24:22.140 --> 24:24.508
Suddenly her dad's
all pony rides and presents.

24:24.509 --> 24:25.910
Son of a you know what.

24:25.911 --> 24:28.846
I know what.
Well, you better not say it.

24:28.847 --> 24:31.048
(whispers): Sorry.
DANNY: Well, he is her dad.

24:31.049 --> 24:33.317
He's not gonna stop loving her.
Whose side are you on?

24:33.318 --> 24:34.471
I offered to punch
the guy out, remember?

24:34.472 --> 24:37.073
If anyone's gonna punch
my ex out, it's gonna be me.

24:37.089 --> 24:38.823
Wouldn't mind being
there to see that.

24:38.824 --> 24:40.758
HENRY: I mean, the law's
coming after this guy

24:40.759 --> 24:41.993
because he's carrying a gun.

24:41.994 --> 24:43.728
And the only reason
we know he had a gun

24:43.729 --> 24:45.463
is because he used it
to stop a robbery.

24:45.464 --> 24:47.765
We can't choose which laws
we enforce, Pop, you know that.

24:47.766 --> 24:49.100
So let's concentrate
on robbery

24:49.101 --> 24:52.003
and murder and rape, and we'll
get to the Good Samaritans

24:52.004 --> 24:54.038
after we're done
with the jaywalkers.

24:54.039 --> 24:56.540
DANNY: Erin, what do you
know about this guy,

24:56.541 --> 24:57.441
Blake Phelps?

24:57.442 --> 24:58.542
Good lawyer.

24:58.543 --> 24:59.944
Yeah? He tough?

24:59.945 --> 25:01.445
Not as tough as me.

25:01.446 --> 25:02.246
Who is?

25:02.247 --> 25:03.748
But no pushover. Why?

25:03.749 --> 25:05.716
Did he pick up the Samaritan case?
Yeah. I'm just wondering

25:05.717 --> 25:07.852
if he's someone I could
talk to like a human being,

25:07.853 --> 25:09.420
or if it's just
another notch for him.

25:09.421 --> 25:10.721
Well, it's a
press case, Danny.

25:10.722 --> 25:11.856
It's anyone's notch.

25:11.857 --> 25:14.191
Oliver Young has
a felony record,

25:14.192 --> 25:15.326
and he bought
a gun illegally.

25:15.327 --> 25:16.660
Well, he bought it

25:16.661 --> 25:17.928
for self-defense.

25:19.498 --> 25:20.965
I'm not defending him;
I'm just saying.

25:20.966 --> 25:22.199
It sounds kind of like you are.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.834
FRANK: New York does have
a zero-tolerance policy

25:23.835 --> 25:25.536
for gun crimes.

25:25.537 --> 25:26.537
Hey, whose side are you on?

25:26.538 --> 25:28.072
Yeah, Dad,
whose side are you on?

25:30.709 --> 25:33.911
(sighs) I think Oliver's
got a big problem,

25:33.912 --> 25:35.379
and his situation deserves

25:35.380 --> 25:37.114
a little more
careful consideration

25:37.115 --> 25:39.050
and a little less taking sides.

25:39.051 --> 25:40.584
HENRY:
Ooh-hoo.

25:40.585 --> 25:42.119
That sounds like <i>my</i> side.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.789
(chuckling)

25:47.526 --> 25:49.760
(chuckles)

25:54.933 --> 25:57.134
So, hypothetically,
what kind of mistakes

25:57.135 --> 26:00.838
might hurt the prosecution
in the Samaritan case?

26:00.839 --> 26:02.440
I mean,
it was very chaotic

26:02.441 --> 26:03.674
the night
we brought him in.

26:03.675 --> 26:05.543
Uh, maybe we forgot
to Mirandize him or something?

26:05.544 --> 26:08.312
Are you asking me advice
on dumping a case?

26:08.313 --> 26:10.247
That's collusion, Danny.
No, it's mercy, okay/

26:10.248 --> 26:13.484
It's mercy for a guy who stood
up to those guys on the train.

26:13.485 --> 26:15.186
You have 15 years
on the job.

26:15.187 --> 26:17.088
You've seen good guys
get jammed up before.

26:17.089 --> 26:19.056
What's...
Yeah, okay, and so, maybe this time

26:19.057 --> 26:20.891
I can do
something about it.

26:20.892 --> 26:23.160
Come on. I mean, this
guy trusted his story

26:23.161 --> 26:26.797
to a hairdo on TV, because he
thinks all the cops want to do

26:26.798 --> 26:28.099
is make another arrest.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.600
I don't work that way.

26:29.601 --> 26:32.736
So who you proving
this to, him or yourself?

26:35.440 --> 26:38.209
(sighs)
Doesn't matter.

26:38.210 --> 26:41.178
ERIN: He broke
the law, Danny.

26:41.179 --> 26:45.149
Sometimes the law actually works
these things out for the best.

26:45.150 --> 26:47.351
That's what
it's there for.

26:57.829 --> 26:59.964
I agree with your sister.

26:59.965 --> 27:02.500
Especially with
an un-apprehended perp

27:02.501 --> 27:03.968
to worry about.
Yeah.

27:03.969 --> 27:06.470
Well... Major Case
is on it now, boss,

27:06.471 --> 27:09.206
and, uh, I'm back
to work as of now.

27:09.207 --> 27:10.774
So, how is
the new assignment?

27:10.775 --> 27:12.676
You wondering how
you ended up there?

27:12.677 --> 27:14.712
Yeah.

27:14.713 --> 27:16.413
I mean, with
the Campos case

27:16.414 --> 27:19.049
and the Internal Affairs
investigation after it,

27:19.050 --> 27:20.818
maybe it might've been
better if I got reassigned

27:20.819 --> 27:22.219
to the motor pool,
Dad, you know?

27:22.220 --> 27:23.921
Major Case is a
bit of a stretch.

27:23.922 --> 27:25.322
Looks like favoritism.
Yeah, it does.

27:25.323 --> 27:26.957
I know you
always taught us

27:26.958 --> 27:28.292
not to care what
anyone thinks...

27:28.293 --> 27:29.593
And I don't care.

27:29.594 --> 27:31.195
You know how this looks, Dad.

27:31.196 --> 27:32.663
I think you're stuck
with that, Danny.

27:32.664 --> 27:33.864
And so am I.

27:33.865 --> 27:35.466
But just to
clear things up,

27:35.467 --> 27:37.601
I wanted you in motor pool,

27:37.602 --> 27:40.704
but I defer to my chief of
detectives on those decisions.

27:40.705 --> 27:44.408
Apparently, he thinks you
have something to contribute.

27:47.045 --> 27:48.879
(door swings open)

27:48.880 --> 27:50.581
(door swings closed)

27:50.582 --> 27:52.983
Hey, Kelly Davidson,

27:52.984 --> 27:55.920
tell me how it is
you giving all this time

27:55.921 --> 27:58.022
to this shoot-and-run punk

27:58.023 --> 28:00.124
and you missing the real story.

28:00.125 --> 28:03.961
Handsome is
public enemy number one.

28:03.962 --> 28:07.932
And the NYPD can't touch
my beautiful ass.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.633
Tomorrow I'm gonna
rob another train,

28:09.634 --> 28:12.736
and this time it ain't
gonna be one of my boys

28:12.737 --> 28:14.138
that's gonna get killed.

28:14.139 --> 28:17.808
And I'm gonna give you
exclusive footage

28:17.809 --> 28:21.111
to some real six o'clock news.

28:23.915 --> 28:26.383
E-mailed to me
this morning.

28:26.384 --> 28:27.651
Anonymously.

28:27.652 --> 28:29.753
We'd like a copy of the e-mail.
Of course.

28:29.754 --> 28:31.655
Channel 10 is proud
of our long history

28:31.656 --> 28:33.824
as a friend to the NYPD.
FRANK: Except when

28:33.825 --> 28:35.025
you're not.

28:35.026 --> 28:37.428
It would be better if
this did not get broadcast.

28:37.429 --> 28:41.465
Well, that would be quite
a concession on our part.

28:42.434 --> 28:44.235
There was a lot
of public sympathy

28:44.236 --> 28:45.536
for Oliver's interview.

28:45.537 --> 28:47.838
And there's a lot of
interest in seeing Handsome

28:47.839 --> 28:50.841
taken off the street.
I share your interest.

28:50.842 --> 28:54.778
I'd like to be there
when you make the arrest.

28:54.779 --> 28:56.080
You give me that,

28:56.081 --> 28:58.048
and I will hold back
for 24 hours,

28:58.049 --> 28:59.316
or until the
robbery happens.

28:59.317 --> 29:01.685
(deep sigh)

29:01.686 --> 29:03.487
Not much of a deal.

29:03.488 --> 29:05.789
Obviously, I disagree.

29:07.425 --> 29:09.393
It is the policy
of this department

29:09.394 --> 29:11.595
not to jeopardize
police officers' safety

29:11.596 --> 29:13.631
with the presence of reporters

29:13.632 --> 29:15.933
during an arrest.
Is that a no?

29:15.934 --> 29:17.067
That's a no.

29:18.169 --> 29:21.005
Then it's a good thing
that I already taped

29:21.006 --> 29:23.374
my exclusive
for tonight.

29:24.776 --> 29:26.277
Take a look--

29:26.278 --> 29:28.512
this might change
your mind.

29:28.513 --> 29:29.980
Have a good day.

29:34.819 --> 29:38.455
Extend our coverage all the way
into southern Manhattan.

29:38.456 --> 29:42.793
A cop on every number two train
and every platform, 24/7,

29:42.794 --> 29:44.561
until further notice.
Do you know

29:44.562 --> 29:46.196
how many bodies that'll take?

29:47.565 --> 29:49.066
Yes.

29:53.605 --> 29:55.239
All right.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.674
Let's go.

29:56.675 --> 29:58.809
Where? We're supposed
to be watching the station.

29:58.810 --> 30:01.378
Yeah, we'll watch it
on our feet.

30:04.582 --> 30:07.418
Put your hat
on, kid.

30:07.419 --> 30:10.721
You don't learn about the street
behind 2,000 pounds of steel

30:10.722 --> 30:11.889
and a rolled-up window.

30:11.890 --> 30:13.190
Look around.
Pay attention.

30:13.191 --> 30:15.526
Let people come up to you
and talk to you,

30:15.527 --> 30:16.760
tell you what's going on.

30:16.761 --> 30:17.661
What do you see?

30:17.662 --> 30:18.962
Broken glass.

30:18.963 --> 30:20.564
Someone broke into a car.

30:20.565 --> 30:21.665
Street-cleaning's
on Thursday,

30:21.666 --> 30:23.400
so it happened
over the weekend.

30:23.401 --> 30:25.302
Okay, Harvard, maybe
you <i>are</i> a Reagan.

30:25.303 --> 30:26.704
Hope you're more
your old man

30:26.705 --> 30:28.372
than Danny, though.
No, offense, Sarge,

30:28.373 --> 30:30.441
what the hell's your
problem with my brother?

30:30.442 --> 30:33.744
My problem is making sure you don't
get the wrong stars in your eyes.

30:33.745 --> 30:35.746
He looked like an ace detective
finding that body, right?

30:35.747 --> 30:38.215
He didn't look like a screw-up.
Off the top of my head,

30:38.216 --> 30:40.284
he did three things
you better never do:

30:40.285 --> 30:41.251
leave his partner;

30:41.252 --> 30:42.920
not tell anyone
where he was going;

30:42.921 --> 30:45.622
not call in the open
subway hatch or the blood.

30:45.623 --> 30:46.824
Danny's got skills,

30:46.825 --> 30:48.459
but he's got
a lot of bad habits.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.061
All right, kid?
Yeah.

30:51.062 --> 30:52.463
Come on.

31:07.679 --> 31:10.214
Dress code seems to have
relaxed around here.

31:10.215 --> 31:12.049
Actually, I'm going
out for drinks

31:12.050 --> 31:14.017
with some people, so...

31:14.018 --> 31:15.919
Drinks with
some people.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.721
Work people. You know,

31:17.722 --> 31:19.957
do a little networking.

31:19.958 --> 31:23.026
Better than going home
to an empty apartment, I guess.

31:23.027 --> 31:25.229
Didn't realize
how much I was gonna miss

31:25.230 --> 31:27.431
that nightly dose of teen angst.

31:28.433 --> 31:32.936
I was going through, uh,
some stuff a while ago.

31:32.937 --> 31:37.307
I... was down the street
at a dedication, so...

31:38.176 --> 31:39.777
I found this.

31:45.116 --> 31:49.086
"Dear Mom, you don't understand
what I'm going through."

31:51.823 --> 31:54.625
I was 11.
Ran away to Grandpa's house.

31:54.626 --> 31:57.194
Took me two days
to come home.

31:57.195 --> 31:59.196
Kept thinking you
were gonna come get me,

31:59.197 --> 32:01.765
and you never did.
Your mom wouldn't let me.

32:01.766 --> 32:06.103
I always felt she understood
you better than I did.

32:06.104 --> 32:07.971
Even when you
two were fighting.

32:07.972 --> 32:10.207
Nicky could have written
this to me last week.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.676
<i>We</i> weathered
the storm.

32:12.677 --> 32:17.347
I see no reason to believe
that you won't, too.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.622
I think you understand me
pretty well, Dad.

32:26.591 --> 32:27.891
Thanks.

32:31.796 --> 32:35.032
(indistinct police radio
communication)

32:40.538 --> 32:42.139
Hello.

32:44.909 --> 32:46.510
Ah, Oliver Young.

32:46.511 --> 32:48.178
The Subway
Samaritan, huh?

32:48.179 --> 32:49.847
Mm-hmm.
Well, you're just in time.

32:49.848 --> 32:52.150
We're about to move him from
general holding into the dorms.

32:52.151 --> 32:54.537
Great. I need to show him
a few photo arrays.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.588
(alarm blaring)

32:57.589 --> 32:59.957
(groans) Another
day in the pens.

32:59.958 --> 33:03.193
(men clamoring,
alarm blaring)

33:11.970 --> 33:14.538
(alarm continues)
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Go, go!

33:14.539 --> 33:16.807
GUARD:
Call the bus!

33:20.845 --> 33:22.513
Call the bus!

33:22.514 --> 33:23.647
He's been stabbed!
Oliver!

33:23.648 --> 33:25.115
In the hall!
Clear it!

33:40.165 --> 33:42.299
OLIVER:
They were moving a bunch of us.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.968
Kid came out of the pack.

33:43.969 --> 33:45.803
I saw him out of the corner
of my eye,

33:45.804 --> 33:47.338
or else he would've gotten
more than one in.

33:47.339 --> 33:49.273
You recognize him, from the
neighborhood, maybe? Anything?

33:49.274 --> 33:50.808
Nah, man.

33:50.809 --> 33:52.676
I was getting looks.

33:52.677 --> 33:55.546
I know when something's up,
so I asked around.

33:55.547 --> 33:58.482
Found out Handsome put five Gs
on my head because...

33:58.483 --> 34:00.651
because I shot
his boy, I guess.

34:00.652 --> 34:03.187
No, no, no, no, Handsome put
five Gs on your head

34:03.188 --> 34:04.722
because you stood up
to him.

34:04.723 --> 34:06.590
I don't want to be
anyone's hero.

34:06.591 --> 34:09.626
I just want
my life back.

34:10.527 --> 34:12.129
We've got a cop outside,

34:12.130 --> 34:13.797
and we'll arrange
for protective detention.

34:13.797 --> 34:15.498
(OLIVER scoffs)
Protective detention?

34:15.500 --> 34:16.900
For how many years?

34:16.900 --> 34:19.737
Oliver, look,
we want to get this kid.

34:19.737 --> 34:21.739
Okay? So I know we've
been over this already,

34:21.739 --> 34:23.072
but is there anything
you can remember,

34:23.074 --> 34:25.208
anything they said, or did,
when they got on the train?

34:25.210 --> 34:26.409
Handsome didn't get on.

34:26.411 --> 34:28.512
What do you mean?

34:28.513 --> 34:30.748
I saw him in the last
car at 42nd Street,

34:30.748 --> 34:32.850
he jumped off one car
and got in another,

34:32.851 --> 34:34.618
clocking the platform for cops.

34:34.619 --> 34:35.886
I knew he was trouble,

34:35.887 --> 34:38.088
so I went up to the front
of the train to avoid him.

34:38.089 --> 34:39.188
He was alone?

34:39.190 --> 34:40.424
You know what's
messed up?

34:40.425 --> 34:42.126
I play it over
in my head.

34:42.127 --> 34:43.827
I think if I'd
just sat tight,

34:43.828 --> 34:47.331
let it all happen...

34:47.331 --> 34:49.533
I'd be home right now.

34:52.570 --> 34:55.973
Handsome rides the train,
alone, into Brooklyn.

34:55.974 --> 34:57.474
Yeah. He calls up
his crew,

34:57.475 --> 34:58.809
tells them which station
to wait at.

34:58.810 --> 35:01.145
They meet up, do the robbery,

35:01.146 --> 35:02.579
and Handsome fades away again.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.114
We've been hunting him
all over Flatbush

35:04.115 --> 35:05.215
'cause that's where he hits,

35:05.216 --> 35:06.617
that's where his boys
keep getting collared,

35:06.618 --> 35:08.719
but he could be
anywhere in the city.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.654
Anywhere north
of 42nd Street, anyway.

35:10.655 --> 35:12.489
After that video, he's got to know
we got the two train covered.

35:12.490 --> 35:14.958
I mean, there's no way he's going
to hit there tonight, is there?

35:14.959 --> 35:16.593
Yeah, but there's no way
he's not going to hit somewhere.

35:16.594 --> 35:17.861
(sighs)

35:17.862 --> 35:21.432
26 lines,
468 subway stations.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.368
I read it somewhere;
it stuck.

35:25.403 --> 35:28.405
Let's attack this
from a different angle.

35:29.941 --> 35:31.975
DANNY: Handsome's also got
a farebeat arrest in April

35:31.976 --> 35:35.079
on West 4th Street
and a DisCon summons in June

35:35.080 --> 35:37.514
at 31st Street
and Northern Boulevard.

35:37.515 --> 35:39.783
Is that all?
That's it.

35:39.784 --> 35:41.652
Every police contact,
every known associate

35:41.653 --> 35:43.554
and relative home
and work address

35:43.555 --> 35:45.389
for Handsome
for the past six months.

35:45.390 --> 35:47.524
Now we have to find a
pattern to his movements.

35:47.525 --> 35:48.992
So, what do we got?

35:48.993 --> 35:52.930
Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn--
he's all over the place.

35:52.931 --> 35:56.567
Looks like someone fired
a 12-gauge shotgun at the map.

35:57.435 --> 36:00.304
Yeah, but they missed the Bronx.

36:01.272 --> 36:02.973
You know, Lee Cranston's
cousin Denise

36:02.974 --> 36:04.575
said that that's where
Lee went to hide,

36:04.576 --> 36:05.943
right on the two line,

36:05.944 --> 36:07.511
and Handsome
found him there.

36:07.512 --> 36:08.846
Think it's a coincidence
that's the one place

36:08.847 --> 36:10.147
Handsome's never
been in trouble?

36:10.148 --> 36:11.281
What about Staten Island?

36:11.282 --> 36:12.716
There's no subway
in Staten Island.

36:12.717 --> 36:14.718
See if you can find anything
on the other perps in the Bronx.

36:14.719 --> 36:16.320
Hey, Denise.
This is Detective Reagan.

36:16.321 --> 36:20.224
Yeah. Where did your
cousin Lee hide in the Bronx?

36:20.225 --> 36:22.759
He was at a bar
at 147th and Willis.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.129
Thank you.
Dante Vandos, Lee's friend.

36:25.130 --> 36:26.730
And Denise's boyfriend.

36:26.731 --> 36:28.599
He wasn't as careful
when he went to the Bronx.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.834
A farebeat summons from 149th
and Third on the number two,

36:30.835 --> 36:33.437
and a stop and frisk
from Westchester and Courtland.

36:34.205 --> 36:36.073
Looks like
we just made the choke

36:36.074 --> 36:37.774
on the shotgun
a little bit smaller.

36:37.775 --> 36:39.243
Still doesn't tell us
where he's gonna hit, though.

36:39.244 --> 36:41.111
Yeah, but we don't need to know
where he's going to hit

36:41.112 --> 36:42.880
if we know where he's
getting on the train.

36:42.881 --> 36:44.448
Call the 51,
have them assign uniforms

36:44.449 --> 36:47.784
to every station,
north and south,

36:47.785 --> 36:49.620
That's where he's getting
on the train.

37:01.934 --> 37:04.135
(train approaching)

37:09.808 --> 37:11.976
(brakes squeak)

37:15.948 --> 37:17.753
Hey...

37:17.756 --> 37:19.290
Haven't I seen you
in the movies?

37:20.359 --> 37:22.760
Come here!

37:22.761 --> 37:24.328
Hey!

37:28.166 --> 37:29.433
Hey!

37:33.705 --> 37:35.740
Hey!

37:41.580 --> 37:43.314
Come here!

37:43.315 --> 37:44.382
Put your hands up!

37:44.383 --> 37:46.417
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands!

37:46.418 --> 37:47.685
(handcuffs clicking)

37:47.686 --> 37:50.321
You really are
a good-looking kid.

37:50.322 --> 37:52.223
Come on.

37:52.224 --> 37:54.392
(liquid pouring)

37:55.794 --> 37:57.962
(phone ringing)

37:59.264 --> 38:01.432
(sighs)

38:06.905 --> 38:08.806
Anything I should
know about?

38:08.807 --> 38:10.341
(phone buzzing)

38:12.678 --> 38:13.878
You have to go?

38:13.879 --> 38:15.212
No.

38:15.213 --> 38:16.380
You?

38:16.381 --> 38:18.516
No.

38:18.517 --> 38:22.720
So... what are we going
to do about a meeting place

38:22.721 --> 38:24.221
when my girlfriend
gets back?

38:24.222 --> 38:26.590
Find someplace closer
than New Jersey.

38:26.591 --> 38:28.159
I don't know.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.528
There's something about
the long drive out here,

38:30.529 --> 38:31.862
the anticipation.

38:31.863 --> 38:34.432
Hmm?

38:35.300 --> 38:36.967
You're mad at me.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.269
I'm not mad at you.

38:40.138 --> 38:44.775
We've never brought our work
with us when we see each other.

38:44.776 --> 38:48.546
I'm not sure that didn't change
when you walked into my office.

38:48.547 --> 38:50.548
We can't change
who we are, Frank.

38:50.549 --> 38:53.050
I mean, we can
turn it off, sure.

38:53.051 --> 38:54.385
Well...

38:56.221 --> 38:59.390
It's on my mind.

38:59.391 --> 39:02.259
I don't want
to cost you your job.

39:03.095 --> 39:04.895
I have a different theory.

39:04.896 --> 39:07.398
Do you?
Mm-hmm.

39:07.399 --> 39:08.699
So, this morning,

39:08.700 --> 39:10.968
sitting across the table
from each other,

39:10.969 --> 39:14.205
the two of us knowing
what no one else knows...

39:14.940 --> 39:18.676
(quietly):
...it was dangerous.

39:20.579 --> 39:22.546
Then there's that.

39:39.998 --> 39:42.199
ANDERSON:
Didn't know if you'd show.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.468
JAMIE:
Don't know why I did.

39:44.469 --> 39:47.204
Maybe you want to find out
how your brother died.

39:47.205 --> 39:50.741
Joe died being
a good cop.

39:50.742 --> 39:52.943
And your story about
the Blue Templar...

39:52.944 --> 39:54.111
It's not a story.

39:54.112 --> 39:55.646
You heard the recording.

39:55.647 --> 39:58.749
Joe was working
with the FBI.

40:00.752 --> 40:03.120
This is his pin.

40:03.121 --> 40:04.588
Joe was a Blue Templar,

40:04.589 --> 40:06.257
but he learned
that some of the Templars

40:06.258 --> 40:08.459
were doing
very illegal things.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.295
We need you
to help us catch them.

40:13.999 --> 40:16.433
I'm a rookie.

40:16.434 --> 40:19.637
I'm just figuring out
how to be a cop.

40:19.638 --> 40:22.606
You want me to go under,
against other cops,

40:22.607 --> 40:25.042
take out some kind
of conspiracy?

40:25.043 --> 40:28.145
I'm asking you to help us
find Joe's real killers.

40:29.548 --> 40:31.482
I can't push you
off the fence.

40:31.483 --> 40:33.517
I know we're throwing
a lot at you,

40:33.518 --> 40:34.819
and it must be overwhelming,

40:34.820 --> 40:37.922
but I know what my decision
would be, if it were my brother.

40:45.397 --> 40:48.265
(distant siren wails)

40:48.266 --> 40:50.467
ERIN: The sergeant said
I'd find you back here.

40:50.468 --> 40:53.537
What, no six-pack?

40:53.538 --> 40:55.940
DANNY:
Nah.

40:55.941 --> 40:58.976
Trying to make the right
impression on my new partner.

40:58.977 --> 41:00.511
Right impression or
good impression?

41:00.512 --> 41:03.047
Eh, neither.

41:03.048 --> 41:05.182
You caught the
bad guys, right?

41:05.183 --> 41:06.984
Yeah.
That's usually good for a smile.

41:06.985 --> 41:09.753
Somehow it just doesn't
feel like much of a win.

41:09.754 --> 41:12.523
Because of Oliver Young?

41:12.524 --> 41:14.024
Yep.

41:14.025 --> 41:15.626
Think about it.

41:15.627 --> 41:17.394
Make one choice...

41:17.395 --> 41:20.064
change your whole
life forever.

41:20.065 --> 41:21.966
Well, there are
some that think

41:21.967 --> 41:25.436
that's true of
every decision.

41:25.437 --> 41:30.007
Not really the metaphysical
brother, you know.

41:30.008 --> 41:31.742
Metaphysical?

41:31.743 --> 41:33.911
Philosophical...

41:33.912 --> 41:36.580
Okay. Anyhow, the reason why
I detoured down here is

41:36.581 --> 41:39.283
because I had a conversation
with Blake Phelps.

41:39.284 --> 41:41.452
Oliver Young is
already a local hero

41:41.453 --> 41:42.953
for standing up
to Handsome,

41:42.954 --> 41:44.989
and getting stabbed is
turning him into a martyr,

41:44.990 --> 41:47.391
so Blake doesn't think
this as a career maker.

41:47.392 --> 41:49.026
Oh, "Blake."

41:49.027 --> 41:50.895
And I guess the
D.A. agrees,

41:50.896 --> 41:52.696
so your guy is
looking at probably

41:52.697 --> 41:54.398
a long probation
on the gun charge.

41:54.399 --> 41:56.367
Really. Hmm.

41:56.368 --> 41:58.168
Like I told you--

41:58.169 --> 41:59.904
the law sometimes
works these things out.

41:59.905 --> 42:01.372
Yeah.

42:02.774 --> 42:06.644
And so what favor
do you owe to who?

42:06.645 --> 42:08.245
And please tell me
it has nothing to do

42:08.246 --> 42:09.513
with the silk blouse
you're wearing.

42:09.514 --> 42:11.215
Right. I go out there for
you, and this is the crap

42:11.216 --> 42:12.416
that comes out
of your mouth?

42:12.417 --> 42:13.317
I'm kidding.

42:13.318 --> 42:15.319
Thank you.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.588
How did it feel? Hmm?

42:17.589 --> 42:19.356
Doing something
for that guy?

42:19.357 --> 42:21.125
Good.

42:22.861 --> 42:25.296
Good doing something
for you.

42:29.067 --> 42:31.568
Let's go have a beer.
