27:00.744 --> 27:02.537
Why are you staring at me?

27:02.621 --> 27:03.872
Huh? I am asking you!

27:03.955 --> 27:05.123
Move, bastard!

27:28.605 --> 27:30.607
Crazy American.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.827
Hey! Get back! Get back!

27:42.911 --> 27:43.953
Get back!

27:45.330 --> 27:46.581
Broken…

27:49.376 --> 27:50.418
Cannot work.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.795
Cannot work.

27:51.878 --> 27:52.712
Stay there.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.859
Where is the American?!

28:39.050 --> 28:41.094
Watch your back, American...

28:50.228 --> 28:52.147
Where do you think you're going, American?

28:52.689 --> 28:53.648
Stand.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.194
Stand up!

29:02.323 --> 29:03.324
Hands.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.326
Hands!

30:07.514 --> 30:09.641
Tool shed!
It came from the tool shed!

30:10.934 --> 30:12.101
Open up!

30:12.185 --> 30:13.520
Open the door!

30:13.603 --> 30:14.896
Open the door!

30:14.979 --> 30:16.981
Keep pushing! Hurry!

30:28.743 --> 30:29.577
RUN!

30:37.460 --> 30:38.628
There!

30:38.711 --> 30:39.796
There!

30:44.717 --> 30:46.469
We can't let him get to the tree line!

45:41.488 --> 45:44.742
Antonov, phone for you.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.869
You realize we just had an escape?

45:46.952 --> 45:48.370
They say it's urgent.

45:54.501 --> 45:55.335
Hello?

45:55.419 --> 45:57.838
Enzo. It is Yuri.

46:01.800 --> 46:05.637
Why are you calling me here? Are you mad?

46:05.721 --> 46:10.184
I know. I am very sorry. I just felt
you should know that there has been...

46:11.351 --> 46:15.773
...a slight change in plans.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.316
What? What has happened?

46:24.782 --> 46:27.534
I just got off the phone

46:27.618 --> 46:28.911
with your warden.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.330
A very productive call.

46:31.914 --> 46:35.918
It turns out, escaped prisoners
are worth quite a bit of money.

46:40.923 --> 46:47.262
So Yuri thinks, why not keep
the forty grand and make extra money?

46:47.346 --> 46:49.181
That wasn't the deal.

46:49.264 --> 46:53.018
But it is
a better deal for Yuri, yes?

46:53.101 --> 46:57.773
And you know what is worth
even more than escaped prisoner?

46:57.856 --> 47:00.067
Corrupt guards.

47:00.150 --> 47:01.944
What have you done?!

47:06.281 --> 47:08.408
And worth most of all...

47:09.910 --> 47:11.286
Americans...

47:11.370 --> 47:14.206
...wanted by the KGB.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.239
Goodbye, Enzo.
