01:29.965 --> 01:36.221
Adam, I will honor and cherish you
through all life's adventures.

01:36.805 --> 01:41.393
Wherever we go, we'll go together.

01:45.063 --> 01:49.860
Two cosmic voyagers bound together
by a transcendent love.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.946
All my life, all your life,

01:53.030 --> 01:57.701
and all our past lives
have led us to this moment.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.595
Without you, I am nothing.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.976
Mazel tov!

02:24.686 --> 02:25.687
Yay!

02:27.105 --> 02:28.106
Whoo!

02:28.190 --> 02:29.566
Yay! Yay!

02:44.498 --> 02:46.250
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.086
And the purple. Are you effing kidding me?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.546
Only Rebekah.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.005
A $15 million investment?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.633
On a $45 million valuation.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.511
But we're just getting started.
Just getting started.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.346
Hey. Is Gwyneth coming?

02:59.930 --> 03:02.474
Oh, no, she couldn't.
She's busy shooting Country Strong.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.226
That's the business we're in.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.020
You're acting again?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.146
Yeah.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.606
Great.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.733
James, my brother. Come. Come, come, come.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.861
Tequila shots. Make them doubles.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.615
Okay, a toast. Lehayim!

03:20.450 --> 03:23.662
What happened to teaching yoga?
That seemed like such a good fit.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.332
Well, acting has always been my calling.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.419
But I had to abandon it
in order to return to it,

03:30.502 --> 03:31.795
if that makes any sense?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.338
40,000 square feet?

03:33.422 --> 03:35.674
Forty. Just signed the lease.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.927
Best views of the Empire State Building
in all of Manhattan.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.388
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.473
Is Gwyneth Paltrow coming?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.475
No.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.270
- Do you mind if I tell you a quick tip?
- Of course.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.315
The first rule
of commercial real estate is,

03:51.398 --> 03:53.609
"It's not what you can see.
It's who can see you."

03:53.692 --> 03:56.778
And the second rule is, you know,
"You gotta find the right banker."

03:56.862 --> 03:59.698
You're gonna need one of the big boys.
Goldman or J.P. Morgan.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.908
Who's yours?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.452
Risakov and Associates.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.370
Hi.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.705
Do you mind if I steal him?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.165
- No, no, no. Go ahead.
- All right.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.667
- Hey, is Gwyneth coming?
- No.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.132
This is for you. A gift.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.387
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.520
Daddy, it's too much.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.522
- It's for a home.
- No, it's too much.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.148
Daddy.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.528
It's a dad's job
to take care of his little girl.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.071
Thank you so much.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.823
It's my job now, Bob. My job.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.325
- But just in case.
- Adam.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.413
- Daddy, you--
- Enjoy.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.706
Thank you so much.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.042
- Do you have a tissue?
- I do.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.752
- I'll get you some tissue.
- Thank you so--

04:55.462 --> 04:57.214
One million dollars?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.299
- What are you talking about?
- He--

04:59.383 --> 05:02.135
- You need to slow down.
- Just what kind of a check is that?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.096
He gave the same to my sisters.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.306
- I--
- I mean, that was a long time ago.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.350
I don't know where he got this from.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.187
You okay?

05:12.271 --> 05:13.939
- No, no, no.
- I just-- I wasn't expecting it.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.732
This is a-- We're gonna have a home.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.109
All right.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.027
- I'm so happy.
- You should be.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.405
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.474
- What are you drinking?
- Tequila.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.978
- What kind?
- Whatever they're serving.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.647
I think we can do a little better
on your wedding day.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.108
- Two 1942s.
- Coming up.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
We got off on the wrong foot.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.367
I can provide for her, Bob.

06:07.451 --> 06:11.705
Okay? My company was just valued
at 45 million.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.042
Okay, you never congratulated me on that,
by the way.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.171
Can't buy a home with a valuation.

06:19.254 --> 06:23.008
Well, you can buy a home with the money
that comes along with a valuation.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.093
Did you get it? The money?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.429
It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.974
You know, she was so excited
when she told me about it.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.644
My cousin Ron,

06:33.727 --> 06:36.980
on the board of directors
of the New York Real Estate Association.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.942
- You met him.
- Yes, Yoda.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.028
Taught me a big lesson today.
"It's not what you can see.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.364
- It's who can see you."
- See you.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.323
That's right.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.118
Ron, why don't you tell Adam
about Yevgeny Risakov's investments.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.539
Yeah, did he do the thing
about the 18 cents?

06:53.622 --> 06:56.291
Yeah-- It's a lucky number.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.253
Lucky? Yeah, you will be lucky
if you get the 18 cents.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.011
If you're gonna take care of her,
take care of her.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.985
Oh, my God!

07:24.027 --> 07:25.237
Okay, okay, okay.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.661
Adam!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.247
Yeah!

07:49.344 --> 07:50.888
Whoo!

07:50.971 --> 07:52.723
Adam!

07:53.640 --> 07:55.350
Whoo-hoo!

07:57.019 --> 07:58.020
Adam.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.731
Adam.

08:01.857 --> 08:02.858
Miguel.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.528
Okay. We talk to a lawyer,

08:06.612 --> 08:08.864
- and we get out of the lease.
- No, no, no.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.992
We're not talking to a lawyer,
and we're not getting out of the lease.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.120
Okay, we'll sublease then
and just cut our losses.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.206
No, we're not subleasing either, Miguel.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.374
Okay, then we'll call Randall,
and we'll convince him

08:19.458 --> 08:21.293
- to set up a Greendesk here.
- We're not calling Randall.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.212
This isn't Greendesk. This is WeWork.

08:23.295 --> 08:26.048
- This is nothing, Adam.
- This is everything!

08:29.593 --> 08:31.261
We might still get the money.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.181
Yeah. You can't pay the rent with "might."

08:35.224 --> 08:36.225
Miguel.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.188
We use the Greendesk money.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.318
I mean, that's everything I have.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.447
That's my kids' education. That's my--

08:51.657 --> 08:54.117
It's my first house. It's my retirement.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.744
Miguel, you don't have a mortgage.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.538
You don't have a wife.
You don't have kids.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.707
All you have is me! You understand? Me.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.586
Listen.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.922
You bet on me once.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
I'm asking you to bet on me again.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.181
The Greendesk money,
it keeps the lights on.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.392
Light.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.318
Okay, all right, so how do we--

09:29.570 --> 09:31.864
How do we pay for the renovations
of this shithole?

09:33.282 --> 09:37.452
God made the world in seven days.
I'll get the money before then.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.288
I promise.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.791
You know you're not God, right?

09:44.543 --> 09:47.838
You have to admit,
I do look a bit like him.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.925
The kitchen and bathrooms
are completely redone,

09:52.009 --> 09:55.762
but they managed to maintain
all the pre-war charm.

09:55.846 --> 09:56.930
Does it have a key?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.099
To the park? Of course.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.395
Units in this building
don't come on the market very often.

10:05.689 --> 10:06.690
I love it.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.817
I… I don't know.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.029
Wha--

10:12.571 --> 10:15.157
I'm sorry.
Can we just have a moment, please?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.408
- Of course.
- Thank you.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.832
Adam, come on.

10:25.584 --> 10:28.837
I don't know. I just think
there's something better we can do

10:28.921 --> 10:31.006
- with your father's money. Yes.
- Better how?

10:31.089 --> 10:34.176
Better than… an apartment
with a key to Gramercy Park?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.553
Yes. We can invest in our future.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.723
I don't even know what I would tell him.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.519
I mean, do you-- I don't think
you fully appreciate what he--

10:43.602 --> 10:45.187
what he went through to-- It's--

10:45.270 --> 10:47.272
Tell him you believe in your husband.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.697
This is for us.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.335
Get out of it.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.297
Rivka, it's not gonna happen.
Not gonna happen.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.309
This looks like
more than a million dollars to fix.

11:24.393 --> 11:30.440
Well… $1.5 million. We think.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.277
Where are you going
to make up the difference?

11:35.237 --> 11:36.280
The Greendesk money.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.284
So everything?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.369
Well, yes.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.918
Adam, tell me you've got this.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.596
Adam, tell me you've got this.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.658
Tell me you've got this.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.702
I…

12:28.790 --> 12:30.042
Tell me you've got this.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.711
Tell me you've got this.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.671
Tell me you've got this.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.132
Tell me you've got this.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.967
Tell me you've got this.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.678
Tell me you've got this.
Tell me you've got this.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.348
- I…
- Say it.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.807
Say it. Adam.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.226
I've got it. I've got it.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.477
I've got it.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.645
I got it.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.773
Okay.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.028
I mean, it says
there's another 500 square feet in here.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.532
Okay, come on.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.999
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.502
- What the hell?
- Wow.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.797
Keep the swing. Lose the dildos.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.717
Hey, wasn't Rebekah supposed to come here?

13:20.801 --> 13:22.135
Rebekah.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.347
Wasn't Rebekah supposed to
light some sage?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.140
You know, the ceremony?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.725
She's not answering her phone.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.861
How many more hookers
gotta fall out windows

13:38.944 --> 13:41.029
before the mayor admits
we got a killer on the loose?

13:41.113 --> 13:43.699
They're called streetwalkers, ignoramus.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.783
And cut.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.995
- What? No "ignoramus"?
- No…

13:48.537 --> 13:50.789
And we're moving on. Next setup.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.005
Okay, got it.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.967
Can you go and play back
the scene from before this?

14:03.635 --> 14:04.928
Yeah. They should check it.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.764
And we're gonna move on from this.
But I think it's the take before.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.516
- Monica.
- Yes.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.643
I just had to say thank you
for the opportunity.

14:11.727 --> 14:15.314
Please. You know,
I was a big admirer of your uncle.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.524
Could we have playback again please?

14:22.321 --> 14:23.947
Did I give you everything you needed?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.532
Or-- Yes.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.120
I loved your Cherry Orchard
at Lincoln Center. I just--

14:30.204 --> 14:32.206
- It blew my mind.
- Well, thank you.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.457
So inspiring.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.042
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.294
I miss the theater.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.756
I mean, not that I'm not grateful.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.466
Oh, no. Hey,
you gotta pay the bills, right?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.717
- Yeah.
- Speaking of which,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.594
if you ever need me to come back, I'd be…

14:47.763 --> 14:50.057
Well, honey, your character just died, so…

14:51.683 --> 14:53.435
- Okay, well, maybe, like, for a flashback?
- Okay.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.645
You know, I love to play.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.274
We cannot put the bathrooms there.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.235
- Why?
- 'Cause there's--

15:01.318 --> 15:04.196
- You're right in front of the windows.
- That's the point.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.491
Listen.
Do you have a degree in architecture?

15:07.574 --> 15:08.909
A degree?

15:08.992 --> 15:13.163
I don't need a degree
to understand where the bathroom goes.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.207
But you don't understand
where the bathroom goes.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.960
Would you trust a doctor
who didn't have a degree

15:18.043 --> 15:19.878
to slice your stomach open?

15:19.962 --> 15:25.300
- Doctor? You're not a doctor.
- I'm a doctor. Would you just let--

15:25.384 --> 15:27.886
Let me choose where the bathrooms go.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.805
- They go, I go. See?
- Come on.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.266
If people are coming in, okay?

15:32.349 --> 15:35.769
They go over here. I need them
to keep the whole thing to the side.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.271
- Hi, guys.
- No, no, no. Not there.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.981
- Guys! Guys.
- I don't need a degree--

15:39.064 --> 15:40.899
Don't you have 40,000 square feet
to work in?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.901
Yeah, there's mold.

15:42.985 --> 15:47.030
No. We don't know
if it's the good mold or the bad mold.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.490
So-- Just to be clear.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.951
There is no good mold. It's the bad mold.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.954
Do you mind if we
do a few interviews here?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.956
For the flow, you know.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.207
I don't know.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.960
Can I come into your space
and do my work there?

16:00.043 --> 16:02.004
Yes. Yes!

16:02.087 --> 16:05.716
- Come, come! Anytime. Come. Come anytime.
- Fine.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.011
- Soon as we figure out what the mold is.
- There is no good mold.

16:09.094 --> 16:13.390
So, my husband is leasing this building,
and he said that I could use this floor.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.934
Now, I know it's rough and industrial,

16:16.018 --> 16:20.397
but I'm thinking we could be, like,
an American Donmar Warehouse.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.900
I-- It's--

16:23.817 --> 16:28.864
This space. I haven't seen walls
this far apart since I left Texas.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.742
Can you imagine
how long you would have to wait

16:31.825 --> 16:36.914
before some establishment male
artistic director gave you free space

16:36.997 --> 16:39.333
to do what you wanted to do with the show?

16:39.416 --> 16:42.920
Can you imagine what we could do
if we didn't ask permission?

16:44.505 --> 16:46.507
What would you do with this space?
Rent free?

16:49.593 --> 16:52.721
I'd do Chekhov. I'd do The Seagull.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.683
- Or Three Sisters?
- Yeah.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.520
Oh, my God. This is incredible.

16:59.603 --> 17:03.023
I mean, can you feel it? Can you feel
the energy that we're creating here?

17:04.483 --> 17:05.317
Yeah.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.569
So… yes?

17:09.404 --> 17:11.156
- That's a yes.
- Yes!

17:12.031 --> 17:14.451
I have always wanted to play Masha.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.541
I think you'll make a wonderful Masha.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.417
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.883
What do you think when I say "workspace"?

17:31.426 --> 17:32.636
Productivity.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.555
Quiet.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.225
Just a few more questions on my end.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.978
Do you match 401(k) contributions?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.020
No.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.731
So, IT is central
to the office environment,

17:44.815 --> 17:48.026
so the hours are sort of
"whatever it takes."

17:48.110 --> 17:49.236
Best quality?

17:49.319 --> 17:50.571
I'm always on time.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.322
- You have a dental plan?
- No.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.074
- Do you have a stand-up desk?
- No.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.578
Well, if IT is central to your mission,
why are you paying so little?

17:57.661 --> 18:00.581
Mom, I can ask my own questions.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.207
- Casual Fridays?
- No.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.959
- Private restroom?
- No.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.795
I want the experience for my résumé.
I don't care about the money.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.131
- Hey!
- Shouldn't say that in a job interview.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.507
Welcome. Welcome.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.342
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.302
He's a man.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.721
Okay. I'm in.

18:15.804 --> 18:20.893
Jacob, what do you think when I say
"workplace"?

18:23.187 --> 18:24.855
Cubicles,

18:24.938 --> 18:28.609
ugly furniture, bad fluorescent lighting…

18:29.902 --> 18:30.903
death.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.156
Exactly.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.618
Look, I get it.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.120
It's a good concept.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.164
"Good"? It's "good"?

18:42.247 --> 18:43.540
- It's a great concept.
- It's great.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.000
- All right.
- It's great.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.545
It's a great concept. It's very cool.
It's very progressive. I'm into that.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.673
The thing is… I--

18:51.757 --> 18:55.802
I have an offer for 10K more
from another company.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.597
- 10K more.
- Hey, can you watch my laptop?

18:58.680 --> 18:59.723
Yeah, sure.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.807
Thanks.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.104
So I'm--

19:07.064 --> 19:09.775
She just asked me to watch it. I don't--

19:09.858 --> 19:11.652
Did you just take-- Do you know her?

19:11.735 --> 19:15.864
Jacob, listen to me.
People deserve better than this.

19:15.948 --> 19:19.159
Better than tiny tables,
spilling coffee on your laptop.

19:19.243 --> 19:22.663
Better than hunting for an outlet
like a truffle pig

19:22.746 --> 19:25.666
or waiting in line for half an hour
for a bathroom key

19:25.749 --> 19:27.292
to see only God knows what.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.710
- Right.
- Okay?

19:28.794 --> 19:32.506
Better than hoping a complete stranger

19:33.215 --> 19:35.717
will keep an eye on your $2,000 laptop.

19:37.094 --> 19:40.681
But don't believe me.
Believe our investors.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.350
We're three months old, Jacob.

19:43.433 --> 19:48.981
And we have a valuation of $45 million.

19:49.731 --> 19:54.236
So my question for you is,
would you rather have $10,000--

19:54.319 --> 19:59.491
$10,000 or 10,000 shares of Facebook?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.286
- Sorry, can I just take a couple days…
- Sure.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.663
- …just to sort of go over--
- No, no, no.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.833
No. We want bold, decisive people
at WeWork.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.169
Right now, in or out?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.046
In or out?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.423
- I don't know, but--
- Ya'aqov.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.508
- Yeah?
- Don't let me down. In or out?

20:18.427 --> 20:19.428
In.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.556
- I'm in.
- Welcome.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.141
- You're in!
- I'm fucking in.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.726
Welcome, my brother. Welcome to WeWork.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.769
- Yeah, let's do it.
- We'll see you Sunday.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.646
- I'm in. I'm in.
- Yes. Welcome.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.231
Are you serious?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.817
I was just demonstrating a point.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.070
Got to be a better alternative to this.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.156
Do you even know what this is?

20:39.239 --> 20:41.742
- A shit place to work.
- With bad coffee.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.995
This is community.
That's why people are here.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.080
I've listened to your sales pitch
all afternoon.

20:47.164 --> 20:49.166
And people don't care
about the tiny tables.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.294
They don't care about power outlets
or the line for the bathroom.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.505
They just don't wanna be alone.

20:56.215 --> 20:59.551
Congratulations. You're hired.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.887
Thank you. I have a job.

21:02.387 --> 21:03.597
No, you don't.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.184
You're sitting at the coffee shop
at 2:00 p.m. on a Thursday.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.604
Okay, I don't.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.399
Do you really think
you're the next Facebook?

21:14.483 --> 21:16.318
No, I don't think it.

21:17.986 --> 21:18.987
I know it.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.371
Come build tomorrow with us.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.831
We're going to change the world.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.584
I know it's still under construction,

21:32.668 --> 21:36.046
but if you follow me, I have some layouts
and some mood boards I can show you.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.757
No, no, no, no. Kombucha.

21:38.841 --> 21:42.261
It's like magical tea, but with a mother.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.063
We think it can be like
an American Donmar Warehouse.

21:53.146 --> 21:53.981
A what?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.232
Dad. Dad!

21:55.941 --> 21:58.110
- Are you kidding me with this?
- We're gonna fix that.

22:02.865 --> 22:04.032
My eyes!

22:04.116 --> 22:06.201
- No, no, no. Miguel?
- My fucking eyes!

22:06.285 --> 22:08.161
- Call 911!
- Adam?

22:10.664 --> 22:12.457
- Adam!
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.542
Adam, are you okay?

22:13.625 --> 22:14.751
We're fine. He's okay.

22:14.835 --> 22:17.004
- It's fine. I'm okay.
- I am not okay.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.589
- I've been sandblasted!
- It's okay.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.216
- Run it under some cold water.
- God.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.968
So, this is where my money went?

22:25.554 --> 22:27.681
It's gonna look amazing
once construction's done.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.100
- Sure, sure. Looks great.
- It's-- It really--

22:30.184 --> 22:31.810
Dad, stop it. Stop.

23:03.759 --> 23:08.263
It's funny. People think
New York real estate is about views.

23:08.347 --> 23:11.767
It's not. As you know,
it's not about what you can see.

23:12.643 --> 23:15.812
It's about who can see you. Right?

23:16.313 --> 23:17.814
That's our superpower.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.945
People like you and me, immigrants,
sons of immigrants,

23:23.028 --> 23:25.739
we see things that other people can't.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.284
Well, bro, I love the coworking model.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.954
- Good. Good. I love it too.
- I do.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.957
But Bear Stearns was a tenant of ours,
for Chrissake.

23:35.707 --> 23:39.503
I mean, my parents, Georgina…
they're old-school.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.840
Any company less than 200 years old
seems risky to them.

23:43.507 --> 23:45.592
A coworking start-up,
they'll never go for it.

23:47.219 --> 23:49.680
But, hey, you keep in touch, okay?

23:49.763 --> 23:52.641
You come back to me when you have
more of a track record. Okay?

23:53.141 --> 23:55.310
I'll give you a call in 200 years.

23:55.394 --> 23:56.895
- 200 years.
- 200 years.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.438
- Okay.
- Don't forget.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.942
Is this Georgina?

24:02.025 --> 24:04.194
That's Georgina with George.

24:04.278 --> 24:05.571
Georgina and George.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.322
And the fraternity?

24:08.365 --> 24:09.783
That's Sigma Tau.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.952
- Sigma Tau?
- SoCo was my pledge name.

24:12.035 --> 24:16.081
- Sigma Tau, wow.
- Dude, I don't remember half of it.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.543
That's how good it was.
Some of the best years of my life.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.880
- You never remember a thing.
- I choose not to remember.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.965
- Yeah, well…
- Otherwise, my wife would kill me.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.800
- It's another story right there.
- Yeah, right?

24:27.551 --> 24:29.761
Hey, do you want to have a drink?

24:31.847 --> 24:34.057
I would love to,
but I gotta catch a train.

24:34.141 --> 24:36.810
Stavros, I just lost the perfect building,

24:36.894 --> 24:40.314
and you just lost the perfect tenant,
okay?

24:40.397 --> 24:42.107
I think we both deserve a drink.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.317
Honestly, I can't.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.403
SoCo would have had that drink.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.239
Yeah, well, SoCo didn't have a newborn.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.658
You have to get home to breastfeed?

24:52.659 --> 24:53.869
Bro, that's low.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.876
I'll walk you to the train.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.253
It's a work drinks, Mama, okay?

25:03.337 --> 25:06.340
Just stop worrying. It's one drink.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.133
No, no, no, Mama. It's not--

25:08.217 --> 25:09.384
No.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.220
- Four drinks. Maybe five.
- I know him, okay?

25:11.303 --> 25:13.931
- No. Stop.
- Mama, it might be six.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.641
No, I'll be home soon, okay?

25:15.724 --> 25:17.935
He's never coming home, Mama!

25:22.564 --> 25:24.733
- Poor SoCo. Poor SoCo.
- Dude.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.277
He must be hanging his head
in shame, my friend.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.529
What's that supposed to mean?

25:28.612 --> 25:32.282
Here you are, a grown man
having to ask your parents' permission

25:32.366 --> 25:34.868
to stay out late on a school night.

25:34.952 --> 25:36.245
Do you have to tinkle?

25:36.328 --> 25:37.996
- I can take you to the restroom.
- No, no.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.249
We do family dinners
every Tuesday and Thursday.

25:40.332 --> 25:43.544
Only Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's it?

25:43.627 --> 25:45.337
Why not the whole week?

25:45.420 --> 25:47.172
- It's normal.
- Make everyone happy.

25:47.256 --> 25:48.966
At least we know who wears the panties.

25:49.049 --> 25:51.051
It's not your mother.
It's not your father.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.595
- I think it's you, all right? What's that?
- Hey, no. Hey.

25:53.679 --> 25:54.805
No, no, no. You're wrong.

25:54.888 --> 25:57.057
- Am I wrong? Am I wrong?
- It's--

25:57.140 --> 25:59.309
Am I wrong,
or you just don't like to hear it?

26:01.603 --> 26:02.437
Check.

26:02.521 --> 26:05.899
No, no, you're wrong.
They gave me everything.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.569
Except the power to be your own man.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.162
Listen.

26:21.582 --> 26:24.251
I understand. I do.

26:24.334 --> 26:29.339
My parents, they sacrificed for me.
They gave me everything as well.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.176
But we owe it to them

26:33.468 --> 26:38.223
to make bold, brave decisions.

26:39.224 --> 26:40.100
You understand?

26:40.934 --> 26:41.935
Yeah.

26:42.895 --> 26:45.022
Stavros, take out the lease.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.608
Go ahead, take it out.

26:47.691 --> 26:50.360
Take it out, take it out.
Give me the lease. Come on, come on.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.453
You say your parents gave you everything.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.540
Pay them back by making a great deal.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.004
You'll thank me.

27:18.013 --> 27:19.389
Yeah. Fuck it.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.058
- Yeah. Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.936
- Fuck it. Fuck it.
- Fuck it!

27:24.478 --> 27:26.104
- Fuck it. Fuck it!
- Fuck it!

27:26.188 --> 27:27.731
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it!

27:27.814 --> 27:30.234
- Fuck it, huh? Yeah.
- That's it, my man.

27:30.317 --> 27:33.278
You see? The Greek Gods,
they didn't strike us down.

27:33.362 --> 27:35.822
- No.
- Bartender! Bring another one.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.367
My new landlord is paying.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.326
Am I?

27:39.409 --> 27:43.914
"They fly and will continue to fly,
however philosophic they may become.

27:43.997 --> 27:48.085
And it doesn't matter how philosophical
they are, so long as they go on flying."

27:48.168 --> 27:51.296
- "But still, isn't there a meaning?"
- "Meaning?"

27:51.880 --> 27:54.633
"Here, it's snowing.
Where's the meaning in that?"

27:54.716 --> 27:59.429
"I think man ought to have faith
or ought to seek a faith

27:59.513 --> 28:02.432
or else his life is empty. Empty."

28:02.516 --> 28:05.894
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna--
Let's stop for a minute here.

28:05.978 --> 28:07.646
Just everybody, take a second.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.108
Rebekah, come here.
Let's just have a little powwow.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.028
You're holding that skirt
like it's gonna get away from you.

28:15.112 --> 28:17.948
- Just a little-- You know, it's been--
- I know. You need to let that go.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.783
- You need to let that go.
- Okay.

28:19.867 --> 28:22.661
Because Masha is a woman like you,

28:22.744 --> 28:24.580
- no different from you.
- Okay, she's like me.

28:24.663 --> 28:25.956
She's in a different place

28:26.039 --> 28:27.916
- in Russia in 1901.
- She's in Russia.

28:28.417 --> 28:32.421
She's trapped in a dying society.
She's desperate to break free.

28:32.504 --> 28:38.927
But she is as smart, as passionate,
as bold as you are.

28:39.011 --> 28:42.431
You need to put yourself into this.

28:43.223 --> 28:47.477
- Be bold. Be brave. Let it out.
- Okay. Okay.

28:48.187 --> 28:49.938
Okay. Let's take it again.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.107
"One of them is gone forever,

28:52.191 --> 28:55.152
and we are left behind
to try and begin our life anew."

28:57.988 --> 29:01.283
- "Calm down, Masha."
- No, sweetie, that's not the right line.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.577
- No, it's the right one.
- No, it's not the right line.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.205
- I can see it's here. I can see.
- I was rehearsing all day.

29:06.288 --> 29:07.664
- It's not the right line.
- I'm reading it.

29:07.748 --> 29:08.749
Look again.

29:10.918 --> 29:11.919
It's fine.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.462
Oopsie.

29:13.545 --> 29:17.257
- I had the two big speeches mixed a bit.
- I know. I know. It's--

29:17.341 --> 29:18.800
Well, you do from left to right…

29:18.884 --> 29:20.219
- Honey.
- …we do from right to left.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.055
And with my head,
I might as well read it upside down.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.516
Honey, you're doing great.
Just cue me back in, please.

29:25.599 --> 29:30.437
You want me to read the line by
Chebuttkin, right?

29:30.521 --> 29:32.648
Chebutykin, yes, please.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.776
- Che-booty-kin? Che-booty-kin?
- Don't. This is serious.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.153
- Adam, don't. No, don't.
- Did you say Che-booty-kin?

29:38.237 --> 29:40.739
- No, no, no. I like him even more.
- Adam. Adam.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.659
- Please, this is serious. Please.
- Chebutykin. Okay, okay.

29:43.742 --> 29:47.162
Look, I don't understand
why you need to practice so much

29:47.246 --> 29:48.539
over and over and over again.

29:48.622 --> 29:50.415
You're a great actress. You're a natural.

29:50.499 --> 29:53.669
Well, Monica's friend
is Dana Brunetti's CE, so--

29:53.752 --> 29:56.088
- A CE?
- It's a creative executive.

29:56.171 --> 29:59.049
And she knows all of these agents
and casting directors and--

29:59.132 --> 30:00.467
I don't even know if they're gonna come.

30:00.551 --> 30:02.261
Of course they'll come.

30:02.344 --> 30:04.847
They'll come and they'll see what I see.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.223
That you're a star.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.060
A galaxy.

30:11.937 --> 30:14.690
The universe. Okay.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.484
The big bang.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.987
A good bang. No, no.

30:20.737 --> 30:21.738
A great bang.

30:21.822 --> 30:23.115
Okay, from the top.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.576
We don't just want you to work here.

30:25.659 --> 30:27.369
We want you to find
your business partner here.

30:27.452 --> 30:30.539
We want you to find
your life partner here.

30:31.915 --> 30:34.668
The only problem
with all this incredible progress

30:34.751 --> 30:37.838
is I won't be able to ride my bike
in here anymore.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.923
No, Adam, go around, go around.
That's my wall…

30:41.383 --> 30:42.384
paper.

30:46.388 --> 30:49.266
Stavros, my brother, I'll be right there.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.060
Well, it's green.

30:52.144 --> 30:53.687
- Yes.
- Matches your shirt.

30:53.770 --> 30:54.771
Who is that?

30:58.692 --> 31:02.905
Our new landlord for our Midtown location.

31:04.114 --> 31:07.659
- We don't have a Midtown location.
- Yeah, well, we do now.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.038
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:11.121 --> 31:13.290
Look, I know you would have tried
to talk me out of it.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.459
Yeah,
because we can barely keep this going!

31:15.542 --> 31:17.503
The lease terms, perfect--

31:17.586 --> 31:22.257
Enough! Adam, stop it!
Stop doing this for once!

31:26.386 --> 31:27.429
Just get out of it.

31:28.263 --> 31:32.684
Miguel, hang some wallpaper,
change your diaper.

31:32.768 --> 31:33.644
I'll be over there

31:33.727 --> 31:36.605
- making our dreams come true.
- Yeah, if you go through with this lease,

31:37.105 --> 31:38.732
- I walk.
- No. No, you won't.

31:43.153 --> 31:44.154
Fuck you.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.203
Everything okay?

31:52.454 --> 31:54.831
No, it's just a lovers' quarrel.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.961
Could I talk to you for a sec?

31:59.044 --> 32:03.924
What a night. What a night.
My God, I was feeling it the next day.

32:04.007 --> 32:07.094
God, my brain… was gone.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.971
Yeah, totally. But…

32:09.054 --> 32:12.808
Look, bro… this is a little embarrassing.

32:12.891 --> 32:15.143
No, no, no, no. What do you--

32:15.227 --> 32:20.649
But about the other night,
I got a little more drunk than I meant to.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.150
I think we both did.

32:22.234 --> 32:23.652
Yeah, right.

32:23.735 --> 32:27.698
And I heard what you were saying,
and that's shit that I gotta deal with.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.824
Yeah. Hey, well…

32:30.325 --> 32:33.453
But I came here
to ask you to do me a solid

32:33.537 --> 32:35.330
and rip up that lease.

32:41.003 --> 32:42.212
Rip up the lease?

32:42.880 --> 32:43.881
Yeah.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.094
Okay.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.180
- Okay?
- Okay.

32:51.263 --> 32:52.973
- Really?
- Really.

32:53.056 --> 32:56.185
Oh, God. Thank God.

32:56.268 --> 32:57.603
And we're cool?

32:57.686 --> 32:58.937
We're cool.

33:03.442 --> 33:05.152
- You're a good dude.
- Well…

33:05.235 --> 33:07.029
You're a good dude.

33:07.112 --> 33:11.533
You know, when I told my parents
who I'd leased to, they shit a brick.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.202
Can you imagine?

33:14.995 --> 33:16.663
What is that supposed to mean?

33:16.747 --> 33:20.000
I mean, you guys aren't even
a real company yet, so, you know?

33:20.083 --> 33:21.376
"Not a real company."

33:25.422 --> 33:26.548
- No--
- Stavros,

33:26.632 --> 33:28.842
what happens when this gets out there?

33:30.219 --> 33:31.261
What do you mean?

33:31.345 --> 33:34.473
That when Stavros Gatakis makes a deal,
it means nothing.

33:34.556 --> 33:40.437
Your business card might say president,
but we both know it's all pretend.

33:40.521 --> 33:44.441
Mama and Dada, they run the show.

33:45.692 --> 33:50.364
Stavros, New York City real estate is a--
It's a very small pond.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.449
If this were to get out there…

33:55.911 --> 33:58.121
Good to see you, my new landlord.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.543
Stavros!

34:13.136 --> 34:14.137
Miguel.

34:21.311 --> 34:22.646
I know I'm not God.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.235
Because I can't do it without you.

34:32.406 --> 34:35.534
You know that. I'll see you inside, okay?

34:36.201 --> 34:37.202
See you in there!

34:47.379 --> 34:49.797
Shit.

35:02.644 --> 35:04.354
You gotta line up the pattern.

35:04.438 --> 35:08.233
I know you have to line up the pattern.
That's what I was trying to do.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.653
Father died one year ago today.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.406
Your saint's day, Irina.

35:14.990 --> 35:19.703
It was very cold, snowing, in fact,
and I never thought I'd live through it.

35:20.871 --> 35:22.414
But now, a year has gone by,

35:22.497 --> 35:25.667
we don't mind thinking about it,
and you're back to wearing white.

35:25.751 --> 35:27.377
Why remember?

35:33.509 --> 35:37.221
On the curved seashore,
a green oak stands.

35:39.681 --> 35:43.435
Around that oak is a golden chain.
A golden chain.

35:45.896 --> 35:46.939
What the fuck?

35:47.022 --> 35:51.026
You're in a funny mood today.
Where are you going?

35:51.109 --> 35:53.278
- Home.
- That's odd.

35:53.946 --> 35:55.322
Are we doing accents?

35:55.405 --> 35:57.282
Never mind.
I'm coming back in the evening.

35:57.366 --> 35:58.659
Goodbye, my darling.

35:59.159 --> 36:02.287
Once again, I wish you well and happy.

36:07.042 --> 36:11.380
In old days, when Father was alive,
we always had 30 or four--

36:11.463 --> 36:13.966
or 40 officers.

36:24.268 --> 36:25.352
Amazing.

36:25.853 --> 36:27.938
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

36:28.021 --> 36:30.774
I closed my eyes.
I thought I was in Moscow.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.109
Thank you.

36:32.901 --> 36:34.695
I couldn't keep my eyes off of you.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.697
Thank you, my love.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.700
Little more rehearsal next time.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.828
It was really something.
Yeah, it was great.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.204
You made the space alive.

36:44.288 --> 36:45.789
- You gave it something special.
- It was.

36:45.873 --> 36:47.624
- Thank you for all of this.
- Worth it.

36:47.708 --> 36:50.377
- Honey.
- Hey. Hey.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.129
- Hey, we did it.
- Yes.

36:52.212 --> 36:56.884
That was-- You know, you gotta start
somewhere, and you were very good.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.845
It's only gonna get better and easier.

37:00.596 --> 37:02.222
- Really great.
- Thank you.

37:03.432 --> 37:05.934
Okay, I'm gonna head back up.
I'll meet you at home, okay?

37:06.018 --> 37:07.227
Okay, thanks for coming.

37:07.311 --> 37:08.687
- Okay. Of course.
- Love you.

37:08.770 --> 37:09.771
Wouldn't miss it.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.356
- Love you. Love you more.
- Love you.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.192
- Love you. Okay, bye.
- Love you. Okay.

37:51.021 --> 37:54.775
We have Four Loko, we have tequila,
we have a Fruit Roll-Up.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.318
I know who that goes to.

37:57.444 --> 38:00.989
Listen to me. Twelve hours till showtime.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.117
And we can do a lot in 12 hours.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.536
- Are you with me?
- Fuck yes.

38:05.619 --> 38:07.829
- I said are you with me?
- Yes!

38:07.913 --> 38:09.248
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

38:09.331 --> 38:10.707
Are you with me?

38:10.791 --> 38:12.376
Are you with me?

38:13.460 --> 38:14.503
Let's go, baby!

38:33.814 --> 38:34.815
Adam!

38:36.817 --> 38:38.026
I don't know. Here we go.

38:38.110 --> 38:38.944
Adam!

38:48.287 --> 38:49.872
Here we go. Pull that.

38:54.626 --> 38:58.130
Pull out these couches, then kind of
have them facing where the sun sets, but--

39:01.967 --> 39:02.968
Yeah. Here it comes.

39:04.303 --> 39:05.637
Wait. Winner.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.264
- You get a rematch.
- You know what, I--

39:07.347 --> 39:08.682
…go and have their coffee.

39:12.186 --> 39:13.645
I'm telling you,
I've been around the block.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.606
You can never go wrong…

39:16.190 --> 39:18.483
Okay, okay,
I'll show you where the light is.

39:22.696 --> 39:25.157
- Why didn't you answer your phone?
- Give me five minutes and I'll be down.

39:25.240 --> 39:29.077
- Now. Let's go! Come on. No!
- Okay, it's expensive. Be careful! Mom!

39:33.415 --> 39:34.625
Cheers.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.627
- Come on, we're late!
- I'm coming!

39:36.710 --> 39:39.379
- Come!
- I told you, I have a calc midterm today.

39:39.463 --> 39:40.797
Now, do you see the yellow wire?

39:40.881 --> 39:43.467
The blue one is plugged in the trunk.

39:43.550 --> 39:44.718
The double-banded green wire.

39:44.801 --> 39:48.013
Okay, that's it. I can't do this.
I'm calling you an Uber.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.139
Mom, can you turn it down?

39:49.223 --> 39:51.433
- No, it's her favorite song!
- Turn it down!

39:53.769 --> 39:54.895
It's pink.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.399
It's beautiful.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.153
Yeah.

40:03.237 --> 40:04.446
Look at what we did.

40:06.615 --> 40:07.824
What you did.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.959
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You're not getting away with that.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.836
We've been working too hard.

40:20.337 --> 40:22.047
Yes. Okay--

40:22.798 --> 40:25.425
- Yeah-- Yeah, okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay.

40:26.009 --> 40:27.678
Now we're ready.

40:32.182 --> 40:36.728
In two minutes, everything changes.

40:38.105 --> 40:41.316
This isn't a place for people
to punch in and out.

40:42.067 --> 40:45.529
It's a place for people to connect.

40:53.745 --> 40:54.830
To belong.

40:56.790 --> 40:59.793
And when people feel that here,
when they feel that energy,

40:59.877 --> 41:01.628
they'll tell their friends.

41:02.171 --> 41:04.965
And their friends will tell their friends.

41:05.549 --> 41:09.344
And their friends will tell the world.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.264
- Yes.
- The swing.

41:12.347 --> 41:13.891
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah.

41:28.864 --> 41:32.242
And pretty soon, pretty soon,

41:32.951 --> 41:38.332
two locations will seem
like a distant memory.

41:43.378 --> 41:44.588
To the future.

41:46.215 --> 41:47.132
Lehayim.

41:47.216 --> 41:48.425
- Lehayim.
- Lehayim.

41:48.509 --> 41:49.384
WeWork!

41:49.468 --> 41:51.678
WeWork! WeWork!

41:51.762 --> 41:56.099
WeWork! WeWork! WeWork! WeWork! WeWork!

41:56.183 --> 41:57.184
- WeWork!
- Whoo!

41:58.685 --> 42:00.437
- Okay.
- Whoo!

42:14.117 --> 42:16.870
Lesley, did we unlock the doors?

42:17.746 --> 42:18.580
Yeah.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.541
It's unlocked?
Because sometimes it sticks.

42:20.624 --> 42:21.625
Yeah.

42:21.708 --> 42:22.876
It's open.

42:23.752 --> 42:24.753
You sure?

42:25.629 --> 42:26.797
Yeah.

42:28.423 --> 42:32.302
It was like this revelation.

42:33.428 --> 42:35.305
I was never meant to be an actor.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.600
Actors are selfish.

42:38.684 --> 42:43.564
And, "It's all about me. Look at me,
clap for me, pay attention to me."

42:44.398 --> 42:46.149
Anyway…

42:47.401 --> 42:50.028
these are for you.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.490
Give them to a worthy student.

42:54.241 --> 42:55.701
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you.

42:55.784 --> 42:57.911
It's such a shame
we're gonna lose the space.

42:57.995 --> 43:01.707
What? We're losing the space? Why?

43:01.790 --> 43:03.125
Didn't someone--

43:03.208 --> 43:06.044
Yeah,
WeWork has to start rehabbing this floor.

43:07.004 --> 43:10.340
But we've committed to artists
that are already rehearsing.

43:10.424 --> 43:12.426
Can they at least keep their dates?

43:14.178 --> 43:15.179
Probably.

43:15.721 --> 43:17.097
Probably?

43:19.808 --> 43:20.976
Fuck me.

43:36.909 --> 43:39.328
- Next time, next time.
- Okay, okay. Fine.

43:47.002 --> 43:48.253
Hello.

43:50.714 --> 43:52.382
- How's your day?
- It was good.

43:52.466 --> 43:53.342
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:53.425 --> 43:55.594
- You almost done with your meeting?
- No.

43:55.677 --> 43:59.014
It's just one meeting after another
and another and another.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.015
Yeah.

44:01.517 --> 44:02.809
Yeah, it's beautiful.

44:04.144 --> 44:05.479
And special…

44:07.981 --> 44:09.107
You're beautiful.

44:09.858 --> 44:10.859
Thank you.

44:11.568 --> 44:13.195
Here it is. Here it is.

44:14.696 --> 44:15.781
Here?

44:15.864 --> 44:16.865
Here.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.285
Adam, you didn't say the dinner was here.

44:20.369 --> 44:22.204
Oh, right!

44:22.287 --> 44:24.831
- This is the apartment that you loved.
- This is the apartment.

44:24.915 --> 44:26.625
- The one with…
- …the view of Gramercy Park.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.377
Yes, all right.
Now we're gonna have dinner here.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.797
- I didn't remember the address.
- I'm so glad that now I found out.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.844
- Should we just…
- Okay. Yeah.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.268
Honey. This isn't the right apartment.

44:44.351 --> 44:47.229
- No, no, no. It's the right one.
- Honey, there's nobody here.

44:47.312 --> 44:48.313
What are--

44:48.897 --> 44:53.110
I said dinner,
but it's more of a housewarming.

45:09.710 --> 45:11.336
Oh, my God.

45:12.546 --> 45:14.715
Oh, my-- Can we afford this?

45:14.798 --> 45:17.342
No, but we will. We will.

45:18.635 --> 45:21.889
It's five bedrooms, but--

45:25.559 --> 45:26.602
Rivka.

45:28.437 --> 45:29.730
Thank you. Thank you.

45:29.813 --> 45:31.356
No, no, no, thank you.

45:32.149 --> 45:33.358
There's five bedrooms.

45:33.442 --> 45:35.444
- Five bedrooms?
- Yes, one's a bit small,

45:35.527 --> 45:37.821
- so I thought maybe a meditation--
- Nursery?

46:00.636 --> 46:03.472
And when the heel finally snapped shut,

46:03.555 --> 46:07.476
it almost cut off the tip of her finger.
Blood was spurting everywhere.

46:07.559 --> 46:09.811
The look on the buyer's face was--

46:09.895 --> 46:12.397
It was a disaster, a complete disaster.

46:12.481 --> 46:14.066
What-- So, did you make the sale?

46:14.149 --> 46:15.317
Of course I made the sale.

46:19.988 --> 46:22.324
You know, I'm sitting here,
and I'm listening to you,

46:22.407 --> 46:24.535
and all I can do is think three things.

46:24.618 --> 46:27.496
First, "God, he's got great hair."

46:29.289 --> 46:33.335
Second, "I'm looking at a WeWork sign."

46:33.919 --> 46:35.671
Now, that's your second location, right?

46:35.754 --> 46:38.799
Second location. Very proud.
Second location.

46:38.882 --> 46:44.596
Yeah, it kinda feels a little like
you're targeting potential investors here.

46:46.849 --> 46:48.976
And what is the third thing?

46:52.479 --> 46:53.772
"Aren't his feet cold?"

46:56.400 --> 46:58.068
No, seriously, you chose a location

46:58.151 --> 47:01.321
across from one of
the world's biggest investment banks.

47:02.364 --> 47:03.740
Am I onto something here?

47:03.824 --> 47:08.328
It's not what you can see.
It's who can see you.

47:08.412 --> 47:11.540
So, how many locations is WeWork
hoping to open in New York?

47:11.623 --> 47:16.336
Who leases the most amount of space
in New York City right now?

47:16.420 --> 47:18.964
Well,
I think that would have to be J.P. Morgan.

47:19.047 --> 47:20.966
Say hi, Mr. Dimon.

47:23.468 --> 47:27.931
Mr. Dimon, we'll overtake you
in three years. Three years.

47:29.474 --> 47:31.894
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No disrespect.

47:32.561 --> 47:34.980
But I am completely serious.

47:35.606 --> 47:39.693
The future of work, it looks different.

47:40.611 --> 47:45.240
There's a new generation out there,
and it's big. You understand?

47:46.158 --> 47:49.369
And they don't think like their parents,
they don't dress like their parents,

47:49.453 --> 47:50.954
they don't work like their parents.

47:51.038 --> 47:53.457
Why would they want
their parents' offices?

47:54.374 --> 47:55.375
Right?

47:56.585 --> 48:02.633
Young people want it to be fun,
exciting, inspired.

48:02.716 --> 48:04.676
And fortunately for us,

48:04.760 --> 48:08.805
our landlords immediately,
in every location,

48:08.889 --> 48:10.682
immediately shared that vision.

48:11.600 --> 48:14.770
WeWork is not just a company.

48:16.146 --> 48:17.439
It's a movement.

48:19.399 --> 48:22.736
It's millions and millions
of people saying,

48:22.819 --> 48:25.614
"I don't just want to make a living."

48:27.783 --> 48:29.284
They want to make a life.

48:37.334 --> 48:40.295
Well, I definitely want to come back
as you in my next life.

48:40.379 --> 48:41.797
Scott.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.383
Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Neumann.

48:48.428 --> 48:49.429
Thank you.

48:51.181 --> 48:53.642
I don't think I understood
a word that you said,

48:53.725 --> 48:55.936
but I really wish I'd said it first.

48:57.396 --> 48:59.064
- I'll take it as a compliment.
- Do.

49:09.032 --> 49:10.951
- Thank you.
- Adam.

49:11.034 --> 49:13.078
Bruce Dunlevie, Benchmark Capital.

49:13.161 --> 49:14.204
Bruce.

49:16.456 --> 49:17.457
I want a tour.

49:18.292 --> 49:19.293
Absolutely.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.380
Some people just have it.

49:24.840 --> 49:25.883
He's a star.
