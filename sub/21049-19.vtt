WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:11.219
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, Maggie.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.221
Hey, Abby. Is your father okay?

00:13.305 --> 00:16.724
Yeah, yeah. No, he had some,
uh, shortness of breath and chest pain

00:16.808 --> 00:18.435
but he's doing a lot better now.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.688
You know, it's funny. Dad always says
that me and Colt raise his heart rate.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.399
It was actually pretty cool to see it
on the screen when we walked in.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.567
[Maggie scoffs]

00:26.234 --> 00:27.277
-Where's Colt?
-[Rooster sighs]

00:27.360 --> 00:28.653
Oh, he's back with Mr. Bennett.

00:28.736 --> 00:31.364
Rooster got us kicked out
for flirtin' with the nurse.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.449
I wasn't flirtin'.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.742
You said, "Girl, you must be stitches,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.578
'cause I wanna take you out
in a couple days."

00:36.661 --> 00:38.121
-[chuckles]
-Tsk.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.582
You guys doing all right with this?

00:40.665 --> 00:42.792
[sighs] I mean, I guess.
I'm just redoing Dad's paperwork.

00:42.875 --> 00:45.337
Check it out.
Under "Social," he wrote "Nope."

00:45.420 --> 00:48.423
And under "Emergency Contact,"
he wrote "My gun."

00:50.383 --> 00:54.221
Under "Any Allergies," he wrote,
"Yeah, to stupid fucking questions."

00:56.806 --> 00:58.766
Mr. Bennett, how are you doing?

00:58.850 --> 01:01.269
Hey, Dad. Well, I can see
that you're frowning there,

01:01.353 --> 01:03.355
so I assume everything is gonna be okay.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.482
I told you not to tell anyone.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.734
Yeah, why would you want
your family to know?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.277
What did they say?

01:09.361 --> 01:12.364
They said I'm fine
and I should go on home.

01:12.447 --> 01:16.409
No, they said you need to see
a cardiologist in Grand Junction.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.078
That your EKG is irregular.

01:18.703 --> 01:19.829
Jesus, Beau.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.707
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going home.

01:22.790 --> 01:27.003
Dad, the doctor said there's a good chance
you got a block in one of your arteries.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.130
You might have to have surgery.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.133
Mr. Bennett, that's not something
you want to ignore.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.720
Okay, well,
I guess we're gonna ignore that too.

01:35.803 --> 01:36.846
Come on, Dad.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.474
-[Abby sighs]
-Don't worry. I got the keys to his truck.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.728
Oh, shit. He took them from me
when he hugged me.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.062
I knew that hug wasn't real.

01:47.064 --> 01:49.066
[theme song playing]

02:52.214 --> 02:53.465
Are you insane?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.926
I had a little chest pain
and a shortness of breath.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.513
Same thing happens
when I put Tabasco on my eggs.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.098
[Maggie clicks tongue]

03:02.932 --> 03:04.517
You know what else you put on your eggs?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.811
Half a stick of butter
and a block of cheese.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.733
It's probably why you had a heart attack!

03:11.816 --> 03:14.486
They called it a cardiac episode.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.988
Yeah. That's just a nice way
of saying it, Dad. All right?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.323
It's, like, the same reason

03:18.406 --> 03:22.118
we call Jim and Don down
at the framing store "roommates."

03:23.745 --> 03:25.538
Yeah, my Uncle Pete was healthy,

03:25.622 --> 03:27.582
until he had his heart attack
driving his tractor.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.418
You know, he had a blockage
they call the "widow-maker."

03:30.502 --> 03:32.504
He was dead before his head hit the horn.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.172
You know, in cartoons,
when they drive through the barn

03:35.257 --> 03:37.174
and then there's a hole
in the shape of the character?

03:37.259 --> 03:40.387
Well, that didn't happen.
It was a closed casket.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.767
Dad... come on.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.436
Well, this is stupid, all right?

03:48.520 --> 03:49.937
You walked away from this one,

03:50.021 --> 03:51.939
but the next one,
you might not be so lucky.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.692
Let's... let's just go to the hospital.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.528
Hospitals are where you go to die.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.242
When James Cobb went in for his appendix,
he ended up in a two-year coma.

04:03.285 --> 04:07.038
Imagine that. You boys coming in
to read to me every day...

04:07.121 --> 04:09.749
me not being able
to tell you to shut the fuck up.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.878
Come on, Dad.
Don't talk like that, all right?

04:13.961 --> 04:17.131
You're going to be able to tell us
to shut the fuck up for years to come.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.759
I'm gonna go to bed.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.887
If you all are still here when I wake up,

04:22.970 --> 04:25.265
I'll know I didn't die and go to Heaven.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.437
[Colt] Dad. Dad, come on.
This ain't funny.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.064
Dad, you gotta go see the cardiologist!

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
Fuck!

04:40.405 --> 04:43.283
You know, it's a miracle
your father's lasted this long

04:43.366 --> 04:45.535
after all the steak, the whiskey,

04:45.618 --> 04:48.120
and his insistence
that salt is a vegetable.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.751
Yeah, plus, certain people have been
giving him a lot of stress lately.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.796
What do you mean, "certain people"?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.969
Someone decided to go behind his back
and protest the pipeline...

05:04.220 --> 05:05.805
then came over here
and picked a fight with him

05:05.888 --> 05:07.181
right before he had a heart attack.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.684
All right.
You know what, Colt? That's enough.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.479
Mom, you want me
to grab your hittin' spoon?

05:16.148 --> 05:18.776
Are you saying
that I caused his heart attack?

05:19.361 --> 05:23.490
[scoffs] 'Cause everything I've ever done
is in the best interest of this family,

05:23.573 --> 05:25.367
but it's good to know how you really feel.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.577
[chuckles]

05:27.660 --> 05:29.120
Wanna know how I really feel?

05:32.374 --> 05:34.291
You haven't cared about Dad for years.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.421
First you moved out,
then you divorced him,

05:38.505 --> 05:41.841
then you ran off with some musician
and threw that in his face.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.595
Every time you talk to him, you upset him,

05:45.678 --> 05:48.598
and this time
you gave him a fuckin' heart attack!

05:48.681 --> 05:49.974
Are you serious?

05:50.057 --> 05:52.852
Look, I get that you are trying
to find someone to blame,

05:52.935 --> 05:54.479
but you are way out of line.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.939
-Am I?
-All right, Colt. Shut up, all right?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.108
Look...

05:59.191 --> 06:01.986
the only thing we should be doing here
is looking how to help Dad. All right?

06:02.069 --> 06:03.738
Yeah, you wanna know how to help Dad?
I'll tell you how--

06:03.821 --> 06:04.822
Ow!

06:11.413 --> 06:13.831
Now, the doctor said
Dad's gotta eat better,

06:13.915 --> 06:16.626
gotta quit drinking,
cut down on stress, okay?

06:17.334 --> 06:19.754
So I'm gonna start by helping right now.
You know what I'm gonna do?

06:20.422 --> 06:22.131
Take all these
whiskey bottles right here...

06:24.216 --> 06:26.260
I'm gonna bring 'em on down to my cabin.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.556
You know, to help Dad.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.977
Rooster's right.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.396
He's an alcoholic, but he's right.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.401
Take care of your father. Goodbye, Colt.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.864
[door closes]

06:51.786 --> 06:53.204
I mean, I just... [sighs]

06:53.287 --> 06:57.249
Look, I can't get the image
of Dad going down out of my head.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.546
-Rooster, it was like a tree falling.
-[Rooster sighs]

07:02.630 --> 07:04.256
Like, what if I wasn't with him?

07:04.340 --> 07:06.008
[sighs]

07:06.092 --> 07:07.343
What if I wasn't so handsome?

07:09.386 --> 07:10.888
These things are unanswerable.

07:12.932 --> 07:16.018
Look, man, he's gonna be fine. All right?
We just gotta stay positive.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.815
How are we gonna get him
to go to the hospital?

07:22.525 --> 07:25.319
[inhales deeply] Well, we can drive him
while he's asleep,

07:25.402 --> 07:28.322
and then we could decorate the hospital
room to look like his bedroom.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.620
Nah. No, then he'll end up just
shooting the cardiologist for trespassing.

07:35.162 --> 07:38.708
We could tell him there's a porterhouse
at the other end of that CAT scan tube.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.252
Wait a second.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.714
I just realized.
If we're trying to get the Peterson ranch,

07:44.797 --> 07:47.216
we gotta get Dad
to sign all those papers by Friday.

07:47.299 --> 07:48.300
Yeah...

07:49.552 --> 07:50.928
I know, we will.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.473
We just gotta make sure
he's still alive on Friday.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.057
Well, what we should do is

07:55.141 --> 07:57.810
tell him we're gonna start bombin'
North Korea on Saturday. [clicks tongue]

07:57.894 --> 07:59.103
-Give him something to live for.
-[chuckles]

07:59.979 --> 08:00.980
[knocking on door]

08:01.939 --> 08:02.940
Come in.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.154
-Ooh. What's going on there, Engineer Jen?
-[door closes]

08:08.237 --> 08:10.156
You know you don't have to call me that.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.242
Yeah, we don't have to call
Meth-Head Randy "Meth-Head Randy,"

08:13.325 --> 08:15.369
but it helps to know
which Randy you're talking about.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.622
[clicks tongue] Hey...

08:18.414 --> 08:20.041
Dipshit Colt.
Why don't you get outta here, huh?

08:21.042 --> 08:23.878
Yeah. [grunting]

08:25.547 --> 08:29.634
-Uh, see ya, Engineer Jen. Herpes Rooster.
-[snorts]

08:32.053 --> 08:33.470
[grunts] So,

08:33.555 --> 08:36.265
I didn't expect to see you again tonight.
What's going down?

08:36.348 --> 08:39.060
Uh, an alarm went off
in one of our storage sheds over here.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.477
I came over to check it out.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.896
Did you happen to see anything?

08:42.479 --> 08:46.192
Wait a sec. So every time I steal a saw,
a hot chick appears?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.486
That is too much power for one redneck.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.949
You know that shed has cameras.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.034
Not no more, it don't.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.121
Is it all right if my guys
park a backhoe on your property?

08:59.789 --> 09:03.334
Yeah, sure. You're probably
gonna wanna leave me the keys,

09:03.417 --> 09:05.712
-you know, in case they gotta--
-You can't play with the backhoe.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.964
All right, fine, Buzzkill Jen.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.716
Sorry.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.384
I just had a shitty night.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.136
I went back to my hotel,

09:14.220 --> 09:16.723
where they were having
a wine and cheese party in the lobby

09:16.806 --> 09:19.601
-and all they had was Chablis.
-Ooh.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.937
When no one was looking,
I stole all their cheese. [chuckles]

09:23.020 --> 09:24.521
-Manchego?
-[cheese clattering]

09:25.940 --> 09:29.986
-Oh. Pocket cheese. Nice.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.238
[chuckles] How was your day?

09:34.365 --> 09:38.953
-Pretty shitty. My dad had a heart attack.
-Oh, my God.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.664
I'm so sorry. Is he okay?

09:42.498 --> 09:43.583
I guess.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.169
It's weird though, you know?
I've always seen my dad as invincible.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.759
You know, one time, he...
shot himself in the foot with a nail gun,

09:52.842 --> 09:56.095
pulled the nail out with the pliers
and then filled the hole with superglue.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.225
-Went bowling that night. Rolled a 217.
-[chuckles]

10:02.434 --> 10:04.854
[groans] My dad was the same way.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.856
I think he would have
gotten along with your dad

10:06.939 --> 10:08.524
if he hadn't died of a heart attack...

10:09.150 --> 10:12.361
You're, like, varsity-level awkward,
you know that?

10:13.445 --> 10:15.447
I don't... I don't know if I'm, like...

10:15.531 --> 10:18.242
Yeah, it's just, sometimes,
I can get a little... It's...

10:18.325 --> 10:19.201
Yeah.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.998
Well, I'm glad you're here.
You want another drink?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.249
I don't know.

10:25.332 --> 10:28.044
I think maybe I've been
drinking too much lately.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.128
[Rooster] Mmm.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.382
The housekeeper at the hotel
seems worried about me.

10:33.465 --> 10:38.429
She stopped restocking the mini-bar,
and she keeps leaving the Bible on my bed.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.097
[chuckles] Yeah, maybe one drink.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.351
[chuckling] Man, you sit all alone
in a little, tiny room

10:44.435 --> 10:46.478
drinking yourself to sleep every night?

10:46.562 --> 10:48.981
-That's pretty fuckin' lame.
-[chuckles]

10:55.780 --> 10:58.532
-[Beau mutters]
-[Colt] Hey! Jeez. Whoa!

11:00.117 --> 11:02.704
-What the hell are you doing out here?
-Uh...

11:03.454 --> 11:07.875
Oh, I was, uh, walking by your room,
and I heard you coughing.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.795
So I went in to check on you,

11:10.878 --> 11:12.714
then I thought if you woke up
and saw me standing there,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.048
you might have a heart attack.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.221
[stutters] So then I came out here,

11:20.304 --> 11:22.932
and then you almost
gave me a heart attack. [chuckles]

11:24.600 --> 11:27.686
Now that's pretty crazy, right? [chuckles]

11:28.479 --> 11:30.397
Are you laughing? It's...

11:34.861 --> 11:36.195
Nope. [sighs]

11:37.864 --> 11:40.491
Why in the hell is there a bag
laying on the floor?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.118
Oh, um...

11:43.077 --> 11:45.872
Actually, uh, it's for you.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.249
It's an overnight bag.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.960
Uh, they're opening up
a Bass Pro Shop in Grand Junction.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.169
So I was gonna take you.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.049
You buyin' that?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.597
Nope. [sighs]

12:05.724 --> 12:08.727
-Get some breakfast. We're going to work.
-No.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.524
Dad, you're coming with me.
I ain't taking "no" for an answer.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.027
That's fair. How about this?

12:16.110 --> 12:17.694
Not a fuckin' chance.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.739
Dad...

12:22.199 --> 12:23.534
I'm trying to help you.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.870
Don't you wanna live?

12:26.453 --> 12:29.623
What I want is for you
to get off my fuckin' back!

12:30.499 --> 12:31.876
-I told you I'm fine.
-Okay.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.295
-Now just fucking leave it alone!
-Okay. Just take it easy, all right?

12:34.378 --> 12:35.421
Look, I'm sorry.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.464
Uh, how 'bout this?

12:37.548 --> 12:40.968
[stutters] Rooster and I will handle
everything here today and you...

12:41.052 --> 12:43.304
Well, the important thing for you
is just to not stress.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.014
Well, which is it?

12:45.097 --> 12:47.599
Do you want to handle it
or do you want me not to stress?

12:47.683 --> 12:48.725
Dad...

12:50.602 --> 12:52.771
This isn't up for debate, okay?

12:52.855 --> 12:55.524
If you're not gonna go
to the hospital, you're not going to work.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.609
Is that so?

12:57.693 --> 13:00.029
Yeah, that's so.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.906
What you're gonna do is,
you're gonna sit down,

13:01.989 --> 13:03.699
and I'm gonna put on  Band of Brothers,

13:03.782 --> 13:06.035
and you're gonna spend
ten hours sitting on your ass,

13:06.118 --> 13:08.787
watching Nazis die,
and you're gonna fuckin' like it.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.004
[softly] Please.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.219
Okay. Start with the second episode.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.305
I like it when they get to Normandy.

13:27.681 --> 13:31.268
Come on. Good. Good.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.230
All right. Hey, I, uh...
If you wanna reach me,

13:34.313 --> 13:37.524
to make it easier, I put my number
in your phone under "Shithead."

13:39.693 --> 13:41.403
I already got you in there...

13:41.487 --> 13:42.738
under "Dipshit."

13:43.447 --> 13:45.782
[chuckles]

13:45.867 --> 13:48.410
That's a good one. Yeah.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.371
Oh, there I am.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.838
[clattering]

14:04.260 --> 14:05.802
What the hell?

14:08.639 --> 14:09.974
Really, Rooster?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.976
[chuckles] Hey.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.227
Yep.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.562
I found that thing
in the dollar bin at Walmart.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.440
-Do you believe that?
-Yes. Yes, I do.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.154
[sighs] Thanks for letting me crash here.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.573
I drank way too much last night.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.452
Did we ride a backhoe to Jack in the Box?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.498
Don't worry about it.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.752
I just remember yelling...

14:38.835 --> 14:40.880
"Put the fries in the bucket!"

14:40.963 --> 14:44.466
[chuckles] You know,
when Colt passes out here,

14:44.550 --> 14:47.803
he wakes up on that couch
in the middle of the field.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.888
[chuckles]

14:49.555 --> 14:52.766
But how do you move
a passed-out guy on a couch?

14:52.849 --> 14:55.311
Oh, well, you see,
that's the genius of it.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.355
Colt doesn't know it,
but there's a second couch.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.149
[both chuckle]

15:00.232 --> 15:02.776
-Last night was fun.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:02.859 --> 15:04.736
You can be quite the gentleman
when you try.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.490
Even this breakfast
that I'm too hungover to eat.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.825
[chuckles]

15:09.909 --> 15:11.577
Well, I disagree.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.704
Every time you blink,
I check out your boobs.

15:14.871 --> 15:15.872
Right now.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.624
Did it again.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.128
-You should get that mole checked.
-[chuckles]

15:21.212 --> 15:23.297
-Oh, I have to get to work.
-All right.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.383
But if you don't need
to be with your dad...

15:27.301 --> 15:28.970
maybe we could hang out tomorrow night.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.679
Oh, shit, like, on a date?

15:30.762 --> 15:33.474
Please don't make a big deal of this
and make me regret it.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.518
All right. Let's do it. Whatcha thinking?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.312
Hit up a DQ and a monster truck rally?

15:38.395 --> 15:40.564
Okay, already regretting it.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.070
I am taking this with me.
It is degrading to women.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.447
It's also super cozy.

15:53.285 --> 15:57.164
-Hey, Maggie.
-Hi, sweetie. Hey, how's Beau doing?

15:57.248 --> 15:59.583
Oh, still refusing
to go in for more tests.

15:59.666 --> 16:01.127
But he was in good spirits, though.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.255
When I left, he was watching
paratroopers jump into Normandy.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.800
He said that World War II is the only
excuse for an American to go to France.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.140
Colt put on  Band of Brothers.  Smart.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.226
For Beau, it's like one of those machines
that makes the ocean sounds.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.105
Things got a little heated
the other night.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.483
Look, if anyone is to blame
for Mr. Bennett's heart attack,

16:24.566 --> 16:27.944
it's the chef at Charlie's Steakhouse,
who put an item on the dessert menu

16:28.029 --> 16:30.156
-that just says, "More Steak."
-[Maggie chuckles]

16:31.240 --> 16:33.825
Yeah, they have three pictures up
on the wall there.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.913
The governor of Colorado,
John Elway and Beau's mustache.

16:37.997 --> 16:38.998
[chuckles]

16:40.541 --> 16:45.004
I know it wasn't my fault.
And Colt's just upset about his father.

16:45.087 --> 16:50.009
And when the Bennett men get upset,
they lash out. Or shut down. Or drink.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.178
Are you sure
you wanna marry into this family?

16:53.845 --> 16:56.348
I have a nephew who owns a fan boat.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.644
I'll let you two talk.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.023
Trust me, I get it.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.566
I mean, I have to talk to Colt
about something

17:05.649 --> 17:07.609
and I think he's going to have
a tough time understanding.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.112
Oh, why? Does it involve math?

17:12.489 --> 17:15.242
No, I got offered
a teaching job in Denver.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.369
Wow, congratulations.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.914
-Oh, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

17:20.997 --> 17:22.958
I mean, he freaked out
when it was just the interview.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.001
Look, I'm not saying
it's going to be easy,

17:25.086 --> 17:27.338
but it's better to have
a difficult conversation

17:27.421 --> 17:28.755
than not have one at all.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.549
I know. I just...

17:31.633 --> 17:34.010
I have to pick the best time. [sighs]

17:34.095 --> 17:37.013
I think it's somewhere between
when  SportsCenter  ends

17:37.098 --> 17:40.434
and  SportsCenter  starts back up again.
[chuckles softly]

17:40.517 --> 17:43.354
When I had to give bad news
to Colt when he was a kid,

17:43.437 --> 17:46.148
I'd always buy him
a pack of Big League Chew first.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.525
"You like that gum, buddy?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.027
Dad ran over your cat
with the riding mower."

17:55.031 --> 17:58.952
Last night, Charlene and I watched
that movie,  The Sixth Sense.

17:59.035 --> 18:01.580
You know, the one where at the end,

18:01.663 --> 18:05.167
it turns out Bruce Willis
was dead the whole time. [chuckles]

18:05.917 --> 18:06.960
Never seen it.

18:07.043 --> 18:10.046
Oh, you ought to watch it.
It's got a hell of a surprise ending.

18:12.466 --> 18:18.264
You know, a lot of people hate him,
but I just love that M. Night Shyamalan.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.309
I often wonder what that "M" stands for.

18:22.393 --> 18:27.606
As far as I'm concerned,
it means "motherfucking good filmmaker."

18:31.193 --> 18:33.069
You know what, Dale? New rule.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.822
If I can't drink, you can't talk.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
Well, I thought
it was a great story, Dale,

18:40.452 --> 18:41.953
but it didn't answer my question.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.457
I'm sorry, Joanne, what question was that?

18:45.541 --> 18:48.084
Don't you think
Beau should go to the hospital?

18:49.753 --> 18:53.257
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
They probably just wanna do an angiogram.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.802
Yeah, they stick a camera in your heart.
That's real natural.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.764
Plus, I'm sure
the fucking CIA is watching.

19:00.847 --> 19:02.433
-[Joanne scoffs]
-[Dale chuckles]

19:02.516 --> 19:04.268
It's no big deal.

19:04.351 --> 19:09.190
I've had a camera shoved up
every hole in my body. [chuckles]

19:09.273 --> 19:13.109
My insides have been photographed
more often than the Kardashians.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.196
[all chuckle]

19:15.279 --> 19:17.198
Well, I reckon I better go.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.325
-Well, it's good to see you, Dale.
-You, too.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.910
Go to the hospital.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.414
Otherwise, I'm gonna examine you.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.335
I've got a lot of experience
looking at a horse's ass.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.672
Bye, Dale.

19:33.755 --> 19:37.384
Maybe on your way home, you can stop off
and pick up some new jokes.

19:39.135 --> 19:41.722
Everybody's just looking out for you.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.351
Why do I have the feeling
I'm about to hear another speech?

19:45.434 --> 19:49.104
No speech. You're a grown man.
You can make your own decisions.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.189
Thank you.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.566
Of course, I don't mean that.
Do what I fucking tell you.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.862
I'm serious.

19:58.154 --> 20:00.741
The longer we're together,
the more it would hurt to lose you.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.330
And if you have a heart attack around me,

20:06.413 --> 20:09.625
I'm driving your ass
to the hospital in my Chevy.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.168
Good.

20:12.253 --> 20:16.673
Maybe they can use the defibrillator
to jump-start me and your truck.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.758
[chuckles]

20:21.512 --> 20:23.722
After work, I, uh, swung by the bar...

20:24.473 --> 20:26.267
and talked to your mom.

20:28.184 --> 20:29.185
Why?

20:30.562 --> 20:33.023
Uh, 'cause what you said really hurt her.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.901
Whatever.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.530
Whatever? Really?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.533
Your mom has always been there for you.

20:42.616 --> 20:46.453
Come on. Who was there when you got busted
for streaking at the rodeo?

20:48.789 --> 20:52.584
Or when you crashed that kiddie train
at the mall into the Sunglass Hut?

20:54.628 --> 20:57.256
How about that time
you got so drunk in the IKEA

20:57.339 --> 20:58.965
and you threw up in the Edeboviken?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.344
Why can't you just call it a sink?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.347
Why would I call it a sink,
when I can call it an Edeboviken?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.058
Look... [sighs]

21:08.141 --> 21:11.603
when you came back to the family,
you were basically dead to your dad.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.857
But your mom,
she welcomed you back with open arms.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.360
There is nothing that you could do

21:18.444 --> 21:20.529
that would ever make her
turn her back on you.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.865
Maybe she's just
a better person than I am.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.951
Oh, she's definitely
a better person than you.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.331
But that doesn't mean you're so bad

21:30.414 --> 21:32.248
that you can't at least
talk to her and try and fix it.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.003
All right.
Maybe I came across a little harsh.

21:38.254 --> 21:41.592
Okay, so I'm right? 'Cause I am.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.803
You know you can say it.
"Abby, you're right."

21:44.886 --> 21:46.763
We're gonna get married,
so it's a phrase you should learn.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.479
All right, how do you say
"you're right" in IKEA?

21:55.146 --> 21:56.565
[chuckles] Swedish.

22:00.026 --> 22:03.029
Okay. Swedish, Abby. Swedish.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.912
You know, there's something else
I, uh, want to talk to you about.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.414
Oh, actually, hang on.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.084
-[Colt] Mmm.
-[chuckles]

22:16.167 --> 22:17.711
-That Big League Chew?
-Yep.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.922
[chuckles] I used to love this stuff
when I was a kid.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
[both chuckle]

22:22.298 --> 22:23.675
-[sighs]
-Oh. Mr. Bennett.

22:23.759 --> 22:24.760
Hey.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.095
[softly] There he is.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.017
How you doin', big guy?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.688
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.276
Nothing.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.904
[smacks lips]
And there is nothing wrong with you.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.661
Can I get you anything?
You want a little Big League Chew?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.246
[chuckles] I'll give it to you
if you go to the hospital.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.000
God, if you're gonna take me, do it now.

22:58.209 --> 23:02.297
Don't worry, Mr. Bennett,
I'll get Colt to stop talking like that.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.800
I'll miss you the most, Abby.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.809
Thank you, for all your help with my dad.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.103
And my mom. [sighs]

23:17.187 --> 23:19.606
Oh, and thank you for
killing that spider this morning.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.194
It wasn't a spider.
It was a piece of thread.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.073
-[chuckles] Whatever.
-[laughs]

23:28.156 --> 23:29.908
I don't know what I'd do
if you weren't here, babe.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.702
Mmm.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.872
All right,
what did you wanna talk to me about?

23:35.956 --> 23:40.043
Oh. Yeah, it's nothing.
It's not important.

23:40.126 --> 23:41.252
[softly] Okay.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.506
How do you say "I love you" in IKEA?

23:46.467 --> 23:47.718
It's Swedish.

23:50.261 --> 23:51.888
What? So it's the same as "you're right"?

23:53.682 --> 23:56.810
Oh, it's like,  aloha.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.061
[chuckles]

23:58.729 --> 23:59.605
No.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.529
-Hey.
-Hey. What are you doing here?

24:14.828 --> 24:17.498
You're a protestor. That's cute.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.878
I'm sorry.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.883
It wasn't your fault
Dad had a heart attack.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.260
And it wasn't yours either.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.805
Yeah. Well, I guess that just leaves...

24:33.889 --> 24:35.265
[both] Rooster.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.776
I'm also sorry about
all that other stuff I said.

24:47.152 --> 24:51.948
You're right. I was out of line.
I didn't mean it, is all.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.786
You sure?
'Cause it came pretty easy to you.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.080
You shouldn't have left, Mom.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.875
And I shouldn't have left either.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.712
Colt... [sighs]
that's not right.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.464
I had to live my life,
and you had to live your life,

25:08.549 --> 25:11.718
and none of that had anything
to do with what happened to Dad.

25:11.802 --> 25:16.306
I mean, it's okay to be upset,
but don't blame yourself.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.022
I was convinced he was gonna die.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.151
And I just...

25:30.904 --> 25:33.031
I kept thinking about
all them fights we had...

25:34.282 --> 25:36.076
and how stupid that was.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.414
I get it. I mean,
I know he's going to die someday, but...

25:44.417 --> 25:46.044
I'm not ready for it to be this soon.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.132
I mean, he's gotta meet his grandkids

25:51.216 --> 25:54.010
so they believe me when I tell 'em
what a son of a bitch he was.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.556
It must've been pretty scary
to see your dad like that.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.104
[inhales sharply]

26:04.938 --> 26:08.609
I just... I wasted so much time that,
like, I could have been with him.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.402
Look, he's gonna be okay.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.698
I mean, look at the good news.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.408
They found out
that your father actually has a heart.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.452
[chuckles]

26:26.001 --> 26:28.253
You've gotta get him
to go to the hospital, Mom.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.757
You know, at this point,
I think it's probably more Joanne's place.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.885
Yeah, well, she tried. It didn't work.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.470
Mom...

26:38.639 --> 26:39.765
It's you.

26:41.307 --> 26:44.019
You got this way of saying things
to people that they don't want to hear,

26:44.102 --> 26:46.730
and then, somehow, it still sinks in.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.357
It's like... it's like when
you told me that my cut-off jeans

26:49.440 --> 26:50.566
made me look like a girl.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.114
That wasn't me.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.077
Who put that note on my windshield?

27:03.163 --> 27:04.330
That was your father.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.544
But I'll talk to him.

27:10.461 --> 27:11.462
Yeah?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.591
Thanks, Mom.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.262
-[Maggie sniffles]
-Hey...

27:19.345 --> 27:20.346
Swedish.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.728
It's IKEA for "I love you."

27:31.524 --> 27:35.070
All right... I'm gonna head out.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.657
-You coming?
-Is that Big League Chew?

27:39.741 --> 27:42.118
Hmm. Yeah. Abby gave it to me.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.412
Yeah. She talked to you?

27:44.495 --> 27:47.540
Yeah, she's pretty much
the reason I'm here.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.919
I hope you told her
to take that job in Denver.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.380
Job in Denver?

27:55.298 --> 27:56.299
What are you talking about?

27:57.383 --> 27:58.634
Oh, shit.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.473
Oh...

28:05.350 --> 28:08.061
Mom... what are you talking about?

28:08.144 --> 28:09.395
Uh...

28:10.605 --> 28:12.565
How's that gum taste, buddy?

28:17.821 --> 28:18.822
[grunts]

28:23.368 --> 28:25.453
Now that is how you shotgun a beer.

28:25.536 --> 28:29.290
[chuckles] What's up, Mary?
Whatcha doin' out here?

28:29.374 --> 28:30.583
I brought some food for your dad.

28:30.666 --> 28:33.461
It's, uh, stir-fried vegetables
with curried tofu.

28:33.544 --> 28:35.588
Oh. Well, that's really sweet.

28:35.671 --> 28:37.715
You wanna throw it out here,
or watch him do it in front of you?

28:39.217 --> 28:40.551
[chuckles] I don't care.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.721
Darlene made this shit.
I just wanna get it out of my fridge.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.891
-[laughs]
-[grunts] You doing okay?

28:45.974 --> 28:48.977
[inhales sharply] Yeah, I'm all right.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.562
It's weird working without Dad.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.982
You know how they say, uh,

28:54.065 --> 28:55.817
when you lose a limb,
you can still feel it?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.361
Well, even though he wasn't there today,

28:58.444 --> 29:00.446
I could still hear him
calling me a fucking idiot.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.868
You are a fucking idiot.

29:06.702 --> 29:08.747
-What's new with you?
-[slurps]

29:08.830 --> 29:10.123
I am actually getting my degree

29:10.206 --> 29:12.708
in hospitality management
at the junior college.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.086
-Oh.
-Yeah, I got the management part down.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.799
The hospitality part, though,
makes me want to fucking kill everybody.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.466
[Rooster laughs]

29:21.676 --> 29:24.304
So, I'm, uh...
I'm all out of cooler beers.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.806
You wanna come inside for a fridge beer?

29:28.266 --> 29:31.978
Uh, no. I can't keep drinking.
I gotta go do my homework.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.231
Shit. Imagine where I'd be now
if I'd said that in high school, huh?

29:35.315 --> 29:37.358
[both chuckle]

29:37.442 --> 29:38.443
Well...

29:39.820 --> 29:42.113
-Nice to see you, Mary.
-You, too.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.284
Hey, listen, you, uh...
You wanna go do something tomorrow night?

29:46.367 --> 29:48.411
Just get your mind off all this dad stuff?

29:48.494 --> 29:52.165
We could go down to the DQ or hit up
the monster truck rally or something?

29:53.416 --> 29:55.376
God, you are like a girl version of me.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.672
Yeah, but with a bigger dick.

30:00.841 --> 30:04.260
[chuckles] That is exactly
what I would say to me.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.720
[Mary chuckles]

30:05.804 --> 30:09.557
Look, I'd love to but, uh,
actually, I got a date tomorrow night.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.184
College-educated girl.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.061
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.645
You got a college girl?

30:14.729 --> 30:15.981
-Yeah.
-What's her name?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.233
-Jen.
-All right, that was quick enough.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.443
-What's her last name?
-I don't know.

30:20.526 --> 30:24.155
Damn. That checks out, too. All right.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.840
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.550
Band of Brothers,  huh?

30:45.551 --> 30:48.721
Yeah, it's better than the show.

30:48.804 --> 30:53.726
In my head, it's all in black and white,
except for the Nazis' blood.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.313
Look, I know you said
I wasn't welcome here,

30:57.397 --> 31:00.066
but I figured you were too weak
to do anything about it.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.653
I never should've said that.

31:05.571 --> 31:07.157
This is your home, too.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.284
Thank you.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.164
[Maggie exhales deeply]

31:21.546 --> 31:24.632
So, you know you gotta go to the hospital
for those tests, right?

31:25.800 --> 31:26.801
I know.

31:27.593 --> 31:30.138
So that means
you gotta get your ass to Grand Junction.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.098
I know.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.228
What's the problem, Beau?

31:40.606 --> 31:42.150
I'm scared, Mags.

31:44.652 --> 31:49.699
You know, I'd rather die checking my cows
than laying in a hospital

31:49.782 --> 31:53.161
with some doctor telling me
to count backwards from ten,

31:53.244 --> 31:55.413
with my ass flapping in the breeze.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.542
I mean, they're operating on my heart.

31:59.625 --> 32:02.170
Why do I have to
take my fucking pants off?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.047
[chuckles]

32:05.548 --> 32:10.011
Well, it's okay to be scared.
I mean, we all are.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.223
Why don't you think of your family?

32:13.306 --> 32:16.267
Your father died right here
of a heart attack, on this ranch.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.352
How was that for you?

32:19.479 --> 32:22.273
Don't you wish he would have done
something to stick around a little longer?

32:22.898 --> 32:26.611
-Of course I do.
-So do it for Colt and Rooster.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.614
Do it for your grandkids,
who are gonna want to meet you.

32:30.156 --> 32:34.077
Yeah, the way Colt and Rooster turned out,
I wouldn't mind a do-over.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.414
None of us are ready to lose you yet.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.209
So, what do you say?

32:42.418 --> 32:44.004
Will you go to the hospital?

32:50.051 --> 32:51.636
Will you go with me?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.097
Of course.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.182
Thank you.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.186
Obviously, I'll drive.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.650
