<b><i>This little light I've found</i></b>

00:08.750 --> 00:12.800
<b><i>Take it in,
breathe it out</i></b>

00:15.220 --> 00:19.220
<b><i>A little drum
that's beating loud</i></b>

00:21.640 --> 00:25.750
<b><i>In my chest,
I hear the sound</i></b>

00:31.320 --> 00:33.120
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:33.750 --> 00:35.680
<b><i>Feel you now</i></b>

00:36.150 --> 00:39.080
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

00:39.080 --> 00:41.140
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:41.900 --> 00:45.140
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

01:02.350 --> 01:04.010
<b>I did what you asked.</b>

01:04.360 --> 01:05.990
<b>Are we still not done ?</b>

01:06.560 --> 01:08.730
<b><i>I've only just begun.</i></b>

01:09.370 --> 01:12.410
<b><i>Now is the time to reset.</i></b>

01:14.150 --> 01:15.540
<b>What do you mean?</b>

01:16.500 --> 01:18.970
<b><i>Retire the Black Lotus.</i></b>

01:19.750 --> 01:23.440
<b><i>Everything has come to 
pass as I envisioned it.</i></b>

01:24.390 --> 01:27.250
<b><i>My father may have lacked vision,</i></b>

01:27.770 --> 01:32.350
<b><i>but I see a world ripe for a new start.</i></b>

01:33.950 --> 01:36.080
<b>Leave me out of it, Wallace.</b>

01:40.080 --> 01:43.480
<b>I'll handle Black Lotus. Myself.</b>

02:05.210 --> 02:06.770
<b>Do you know him?</b>

02:09.510 --> 02:10.520
<b>No.</b>

02:11.630 --> 02:13.530
<b>I just don't like his face.</b>

02:26.940 --> 02:31.960
<b><i>The entire world mourns the tragic 
death of a man taken too soon.</i></b>

02:32.650 --> 02:38.420
<b><i>He was not merely a man, for 
Mr. Wallace was so much more.</i></b>

02:39.260 --> 02:42.320
<b><i>He saved humanity by helping 
to solve the food crisis</i></b>

02:42.320 --> 02:44.030
<b><i>that threatened us all.</i></b>

02:45.010 --> 02:47.030
<b><i>And our modern world has been built</i></b>

02:47.030 --> 02:50.770
<b><i>on the cornerstones laid 
by the Wallace Corporation.</i></b>

02:51.490 --> 02:54.780
<b><i>That is why his son, Niander Wallace,</i></b>

02:54.780 --> 02:58.260
<b><i>has been declared the new CEO 
of the Wallace Corporation.</i></b>

02:59.500 --> 03:03.310
<b><i>Niander Wallace mourns this 
loss more than any of us,</i></b>

03:03.310 --> 03:06.280
<b><i>but will take the reigns of the legacy left to him.</i></b>

03:06.540 --> 03:09.940
<b><i>For that is what his father would have...</i></b>

03:08.520 --> 03:09.750
<b>My father's death...</b>

03:10.830 --> 03:13.110
<b>It was the spectacle of the absurd.</b>

03:15.220 --> 03:18.270
<b>And at long last, I feel unshackled.</b>

03:18.870 --> 03:21.160
<b>Free to explore.</b>

03:21.950 --> 03:25.780
<b>Free to dream of art,</b>

03:26.230 --> 03:27.790
<b>of science,</b>

03:28.980 --> 03:32.470
<b>of a world filled with replicants.</b>

03:34.310 --> 03:37.670
<b>Perfect in every way.</b>

03:40.080 --> 03:41.850
<b>What must be...</b>

03:43.310 --> 03:44.720
<b>Will be.</b>

03:46.040 --> 03:49.580
<b>The old world as we know it is flawed.</b>

03:50.090 --> 03:52.360
<b>I refuse to accept that.</b>

03:53.300 --> 04:00.230
<b>I will give birth to a perfect world 
inhabited by my own creations.</b>

04:02.670 --> 04:05.770
<b>We have woven a complex fabric</b>

04:05.770 --> 04:07.560
<b>of many colors,</b>

04:08.100 --> 04:10.260
<b>many designs.</b>

04:11.770 --> 04:15.420
<b>It's nearly complete.
But there remain hanging threads...</b>

04:22.810 --> 04:24.370
<b>That must be cut.</b>

04:34.060 --> 04:36.540
<b>How do I get us out of here?</b>

05:23.880 --> 05:24.820
<b>J.</b>

05:26.190 --> 05:28.430
<b>The memory maker I told you about--</b>

05:28.430 --> 05:30.290
<b>the one working for Dr. M.</b>

05:31.390 --> 05:33.260
<b>The one you let live.</b>

05:33.260 --> 05:35.370
<b>He knew about my memories--</b>

05:35.370 --> 05:37.200
<b>and was able to navigate them.</b>

05:37.830 --> 05:40.470
<b>Maybe he can help me remember who this is.</b>

05:44.270 --> 05:48.280
<b>You think he can rewrite old memories?</b>

05:50.460 --> 05:51.990
<b>Maybe.</b>

05:52.420 --> 05:53.480
<b>Why?</b>

05:56.750 --> 05:58.390
<b>Can we trust him?</b>

06:00.060 --> 06:01.340
<b>I don't know,</b>

06:02.060 --> 06:04.330
<b>but he didn't seem like a bad person.</b>

06:06.540 --> 06:07.770
<b>Listen, Elle.</b>

06:08.250 --> 06:10.370
<b>Why not have him purge your memories?</b>

06:11.110 --> 06:12.290
<b>What do you mean?</b>

06:12.680 --> 06:15.150
<b>You've taken care of 
everyone who's wronged you.</b>

06:15.920 --> 06:19.210
<b>Erase your bad memories and 
leave this city behind for good.</b>

06:21.100 --> 06:23.540
<b>But I might forget about him too.</b>

06:23.540 --> 06:26.230
<b>Why would I do that? 
He's the only memory that isn't a nightmare.</b>

06:26.770 --> 06:28.750
<b>Forget about him.</b>

06:29.760 --> 06:30.690
<b>But...</b>

06:32.300 --> 06:34.590
<b>Don't chain yourself to a memory.</b>

06:35.050 --> 06:37.620
<b>Replicant memories never fade.</b>

06:37.620 --> 06:39.960
<b>This could be your only chance to forget.</b>

06:41.380 --> 06:43.630
<b>If I erase my memories...</b>

06:44.610 --> 06:46.250
<b>Will you still be there for me?</b>

06:51.160 --> 06:53.170
<b>I was a blade runner.</b>

06:54.200 --> 06:57.180
<b>But you've already saved me. More than once.</b>

06:59.440 --> 07:01.780
<b>I'm just trying to balance the scales.</b>

07:02.340 --> 07:04.210
<b>But it doesn't change what I've done.</b>

07:08.650 --> 07:10.680
<b>It's your choice to make.</b>

07:11.450 --> 07:12.830
<b>What's more important?</b>

07:40.670 --> 07:41.810
<b>Hey.</b>

07:44.910 --> 07:46.310
<b>You really came.</b>

07:52.020 --> 07:54.060
<b>No need to worry about them,</b>

07:54.660 --> 07:56.310
<b>not that you need to.</b>

07:58.760 --> 08:01.580
<b>Uh, they're here for our protection.</b>

08:05.250 --> 08:08.710
<b>My situation has changed since last time.</b>

08:09.260 --> 08:13.210
<b>Now I have various clients, uh, 
competing to fund my research.</b>

08:20.780 --> 08:22.330
<b>This is my lab, now.</b>

08:29.420 --> 08:32.780
<b>I admit, I was a little 
surprised to hear from you.</b>

08:32.780 --> 08:34.500
<b>I mean, come to think of it,</b>

08:34.500 --> 08:37.240
<b>I don't think I've ever 
had a replicant call me.</b>

08:37.700 --> 08:40.340
<b>I suppose it's only 
natural to have questions.</b>

08:46.460 --> 08:49.600
<b>Permanently erasing replicant 
memories can be done.</b>

08:49.600 --> 08:51.310
<b>It's difficult but safe.</b>

08:52.560 --> 08:56.050
<b>What if I want to keep the good memories?</b>

08:57.060 --> 08:59.530
<b>It's not possible to pick and choose.</b>

08:59.530 --> 09:01.960
<b>Altered memory states 
can cause fragmentation,</b>

09:01.960 --> 09:05.090
<b>cortex failure, aneurysms, death.</b>

09:05.420 --> 09:09.590
<b>The only way the emotional cushion still 
hold is to wipe all memories clean.</b>

09:09.590 --> 09:10.760
<b>The whole set.</b>

09:13.670 --> 09:16.970
<b>Without her memories, will 
she still be herself?</b>

09:18.840 --> 09:21.410
<b>Her psyche is ingrained.</b>

09:21.410 --> 09:24.050
<b>Her memories would be gone,</b>

09:24.050 --> 09:26.590
<b>but her essence would remain the same.</b>

09:29.310 --> 09:30.540
<b>I've heard enough.</b>

09:31.310 --> 09:32.880
<b>I want to do it.</b>

09:44.380 --> 09:46.170
<b>Simply close your eyes,</b>

09:46.560 --> 09:50.390
<b>and you'll feel like you've 
woken up from a long dream.</b>

09:52.830 --> 09:54.210
<b>It sounds nice.</b>

10:11.800 --> 10:14.650
<b>Stay there until I wake up?</b>

10:17.080 --> 10:18.140
<b>Okay.</b>

10:43.450 --> 10:47.760
<b>The man in your memories 
is Niander Wallace Jr.</b>

10:50.840 --> 10:53.580
<b>He created you to kill his father,</b>

10:53.580 --> 10:56.200
<b>and he hired me to make sure it happened.</b>

10:57.580 --> 10:59.060
<b>All this time,</b>

10:59.670 --> 11:01.680
<b>I've been lying to you.</b>

11:04.640 --> 11:05.750
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

11:07.710 --> 11:09.710
<b>I'm a replicant killer.</b>

11:11.260 --> 11:12.260
<b>Elle...</b>

11:14.280 --> 11:16.160
<b>It would be better if you forget me.</b>

11:19.950 --> 11:23.070
<b>So are you sure this is all right?</b>

11:27.250 --> 11:29.120
<b>This is the best way.</b>

11:49.700 --> 11:51.550
<b><i>Let's go to the colonies.</i></b>

11:51.550 --> 11:56.070
<b><i>This announcement has been brought to 
you by Shimago-Dom√≠nguez Corporation:</i></b>

11:56.070 --> 11:58.050
<b><i>helping America into the new world.</i></b>

11:58.560 --> 12:02.770
<b><i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i></b>

12:02.770 --> 12:07.000
<b><i>The chance to begin again in a golden 
land of opportunity and adventure.</i></b>

12:20.460 --> 12:22.690
<b>I retired Black Lotus.</b>

12:24.640 --> 12:27.040
<b><i>I didn't think you had it in you.</i></b>

12:28.470 --> 12:30.380
<b>And what's that supposed to mean?</b>

12:32.630 --> 12:35.440
<b><i>Pardon, it seems I've offended you.</i></b>

12:36.530 --> 12:38.780
<b>I said I would handle it.</b>

12:41.590 --> 12:43.380
<b><i>That you did.</i></b>

12:44.540 --> 12:49.250
<b><i>Consider your off-world 
arrangements complete, Joseph.</i></b>

12:57.560 --> 12:59.750
<b>Human to a fault</b>

13:00.610 --> 13:02.480
<b>and untrustworthy as a result.</b>

13:03.780 --> 13:06.450
<b>I will deal with him later.</b>

13:07.280 --> 13:10.540
<b>But first, my angel.</b>

13:14.770 --> 13:17.630
<b>I love all my creations,</b>

13:18.440 --> 13:20.860
<b>even the disobedient ones.</b>

13:24.780 --> 13:32.310
<b>But I cannot have a creation lift 
up its head in its own glory.</b>

13:39.610 --> 13:43.940
<b>Like a game of go, the line is in our favor.</b>

13:46.140 --> 13:48.600
<b>Remove Black Lotus from the board.</b>

14:28.570 --> 14:29.930
<b>This is Davis.</b>

14:31.510 --> 14:34.270
<b><i>You'll find Black Lotus at Dr. M's lab.</i></b>

14:35.340 --> 14:36.460
<b><i>Arrest her.</i></b>

14:37.390 --> 14:38.900
<b><i>But don't hurt her.</i></b>

14:40.010 --> 14:41.030
<b><i>You understand me?</i></b>

14:41.640 --> 14:42.650
<b>Who is this?</b>

14:43.970 --> 14:44.950
<b>Joseph?</b>

14:47.800 --> 14:50.100
<b>I can't protect her anymore.</b>

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
<b>I'm trusting you to keep her safe.</b>

14:55.010 --> 14:56.770
<b>Safe from what?</b>

16:50.650 --> 16:51.700
<b>Don't move!</b>

17:58.770 --> 17:59.830
<b>An alarm?</b>

18:01.000 --> 18:02.170
<b>What is that?</b>

18:11.240 --> 18:12.660
<b>Memory maker.</b>

18:46.660 --> 18:48.970
<b>Don't...</b>

20:37.400 --> 20:40.320
<b><i>Had a feeling I'd be hearing from you.</i></b>

20:40.940 --> 20:41.950
<b>Marlowe.</b>

20:42.800 --> 20:45.770
<b>I wanna talk to you about Black Lotus.</b>

21:18.340 --> 21:19.730
<b>Who are you?</b>

21:27.250 --> 21:30.320
<b><i>Someone's chased you to 
the edges of the Earth</i></b>

21:30.320 --> 21:33.380
<b><i>So this place feeling like 
a never-ending search</i></b>

21:33.380 --> 21:35.990
<b><i>Before it's over, I expect this to get worse</i></b>

21:35.990 --> 21:37.220
<b><i>I guess I should've known</i></b>

21:37.220 --> 21:40.200
<b><i>I'd be the one to get this curse, uh</i></b>

21:40.200 --> 21:42.200
<b><i>Need them to quench his thirst</i></b>

21:42.200 --> 21:45.320
<b><i>'Cause I will hunt down 
whoever gets to you first</i></b>

21:45.320 --> 21:46.830
<b><i>Sometimes I wish I could let go</i></b>

21:46.830 --> 21:47.730
<b><i>And press a verse</i></b>

21:47.730 --> 21:51.300
<b><i>But sometimes you have to go 
and learn your lesson first</i></b>

21:51.300 --> 21:54.290
<b><i>Praising the Lord before 
we ever get to church</i></b>

21:54.290 --> 21:57.310
<b><i>Sooner or later, she gonna 
get what she deserves</i></b>

21:57.310 --> 22:00.170
<b><i>I was convinced why I never pressure hers</i></b>

22:00.170 --> 22:01.280
<b><i>Take all of the shots</i></b>

22:01.280 --> 22:04.040
<b><i>Until eventually, you're merc'd, uh</i></b>

22:04.040 --> 22:06.480
<b><i>'Cause karma comes back around for those</i></b>

22:06.480 --> 22:07.680
<b><i>We have to stay on our toes</i></b>

22:07.680 --> 22:09.690
<b><i>The hardest where your power shows</i></b>

22:09.690 --> 22:12.470
<b><i>I left up in concrete, a flower grows</i></b>

22:12.470 --> 22:15.640
<b><i>High up, high up, this Eiffel Tower grows</i></b>

22:18.310 --> 22:21.370
<b><i>High up, high up, this Eiffel Tower grows</i></b>
