30:12.044 --> 30:13.913
[Sighs]

30:13.946 --> 30:17.616
Oh, you know you'd
be doing me a big
personal favor, Butchie,

30:17.649 --> 30:20.219
if you would, uh,
take this rattrap down.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.354
You have any idea
how much money

30:22.388 --> 30:25.024
I'm spending trying
to bring this town
back to where it was?

30:25.057 --> 30:26.025
Not a clue.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.626
Well, it's a lot.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.628
And it's things
just like this

30:29.661 --> 30:33.199
that just keep this town
drying out day after day.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.902
The Lord
mocks proud mockers,

30:35.935 --> 30:38.270
but gives grace
to the humble,
Mr. Morgan.

30:38.304 --> 30:42.108
Well, aren't you
the precocious little critter?

30:47.113 --> 30:51.183
What are you doing
hanging out with this
washed-up has-been?

30:51.217 --> 30:53.085
Hi, Mr. Morgan.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.491
Well, Jackson told me
that you was come back.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.929
Sorry about
what happened to Lois.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.563
[Sighs]

31:04.596 --> 31:07.233
Take her down, Butch.
It's an eyesore.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.102
No... No permit.
No little lemonade stand.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.603
Do it.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.414
Wow.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.583
He hasn't
changed a bit.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.057
He's all talk.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.962
I have an idea.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.298
You up
for an adventure?

31:55.681 --> 31:59.085
Oh, my God, I haven't
been here in forever.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.188
A pool?
Ho ho ho.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.356
Look at this.
Are you kidding me?

32:04.390 --> 32:05.457
Oh, my God.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.194
Oh, wow.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.430
How'd I not know
about this place?

32:11.463 --> 32:14.533
Think we've been
hanging out with
the wrong people.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.169
1, 2, 3!

32:17.203 --> 32:18.470
BUTCH: Be careful.
[shrieks]

32:23.275 --> 32:25.411
How's the water?

32:25.444 --> 32:27.213
Perfect.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.015
Oh, yeah?

32:29.015 --> 32:30.549
What do you think?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.218
I think I'm gonna
splash you back.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.319
That's what I think.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.254
[Squeals]

32:39.391 --> 32:41.027
Mmm.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.763
I used to...

32:44.796 --> 32:48.134
I used to come up here
with... with Jackson

32:48.167 --> 32:50.136
after his dad
had these parties,

32:50.169 --> 32:52.704
and we'd steal
all of his liquor

32:52.738 --> 32:56.308
and just get wasted.

32:56.342 --> 32:57.543
[Chuckles]

32:57.576 --> 32:58.610
Sounds fun.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.412
It was fun.

33:05.317 --> 33:09.255
I would talk about
how I was gonna
take over the world

33:09.288 --> 33:12.458
and kick ass,
take names, you know,

33:12.491 --> 33:14.460
stupid stuff.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.765
It's not stupid
to dream.

33:19.798 --> 33:20.766
Well...

33:24.836 --> 33:27.139
You know,
I think everyone

33:27.173 --> 33:31.077
used to have a place
something like this.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.511
You have one?

33:34.080 --> 33:36.648
Anywhere I could score
a six-pack, park my car

33:36.682 --> 33:39.318
and find a good song
on the radio.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.788
Are you guys
gonna keep talking,

33:42.821 --> 33:44.356
or you coming in?

33:44.390 --> 33:45.724
[Squeals]

33:45.757 --> 33:48.094
[Cotton laughs]

33:48.094 --> 33:48.827
Oh, no!

33:51.763 --> 33:54.433
What are you doing?
No, no, no! Oh!

33:55.534 --> 33:57.569
[Squeals]

33:57.603 --> 33:59.571
All right, that's it!

33:59.605 --> 34:01.673
You, you...

34:01.707 --> 34:04.143
[shrieks]

34:04.176 --> 34:05.644
Well,
that could actually...

34:05.677 --> 34:06.678
Ballast?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.480
Perez!
Ballast?

34:08.514 --> 34:11.150
You keep hanging out
with these warts
on a donkey's dick,

34:11.183 --> 34:13.585
I'm gonna have to have
the county dock your wages.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.719
It's my lunch hour,
Mr. Morgan.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.222
There something
I can do for you?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.556
Yeah.
Serve an eviction notice.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.858
To who?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.261
You're four months
behind, Ledball.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.462
I heard.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.297
[Spits]
Several times now.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.467
So what are you gonna do?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.668
Rob my bank?
That should be
easy enough.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.737
You know where
the Sheriff is
all the time.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.141
I get an hour,
Mr. Morgan.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.574
I can eat
where I choose.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.210
You know,
I got some ideas
for this property.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.280
You know,
beef's making a comeback.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.282
I might just turn it
into a meatpacking plant.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.851
I could even
give you jag-offs
a job killing cattle.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.554
Heh. That means
you're gonna have
to get off your asses,

34:48.587 --> 34:51.157
and I don't think
you're capable of that.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.824
Aw, come on. Somebody's
got to do something
about this little town.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.262
It's gonna end up nothing
but spit in the footnotes.

34:56.295 --> 34:59.631
Y'all sit around here
wallowing in the past,

34:59.665 --> 35:02.868
and blinds you
to the future.

35:02.901 --> 35:06.605
Well, unlike you boys,
I've got things to do,

35:06.638 --> 35:09.441
so I will bid
you gentlemen adios,

35:09.475 --> 35:12.744
and I do use the term
"gentlemen" loosely.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.516
All right, I can't be
killing anything.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.718
I've been studying
the Buddhist culture,

35:19.751 --> 35:22.688
and I've taken me
a vow of passivism.

35:22.721 --> 35:26.492
Should have taken
a vow of silence.

35:26.525 --> 35:30.329
I'll do what I can
to slow down the process.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.699
There anything you can do
to pick things up?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.934
Not yet.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.238
I have an idea.
How 'bout a happy hour?

35:39.271 --> 35:42.708
And since when
hasn't it been
happy hour for you?

35:42.741 --> 35:45.777
Well, you know,
just a suggestion.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.813
Oh, you gotta shut up,
Cricket.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.381
It's imperative.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.253
* So sad

35:54.286 --> 35:58.524
* To be alone

35:58.557 --> 36:04.896
* Help me make it
through the night *

36:06.932 --> 36:08.700
Nice.

36:08.734 --> 36:09.968
Did you
ever try singing

36:10.001 --> 36:11.837
while you were doing
the acting thing?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.940
Oh, not really.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.642
Hmm.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.377
That's too bad.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.913
How'd you know
about the acting thing?

36:21.947 --> 36:24.683
Ah, the walls are thin,
and Jackson is loud.

36:29.321 --> 36:32.258
Cotton, we gotta go.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.259
What?

36:33.292 --> 36:34.526
We have to go.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.794
Do we have to?

36:35.827 --> 36:37.496
Yeah.
Come on. Get out.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.400
I'm hungry.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.369
Well, listen.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.736
I'm barbecuing
tonight,

36:44.770 --> 36:47.539
so, um,
if y'all would
like to come over,

36:47.573 --> 36:48.740
you know,
you're more
than welcome.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.808
Yeah.

36:49.841 --> 36:50.809
Can we, Sunny?

36:50.842 --> 36:51.810
Maybe.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.279
Oh, what am I saying?

36:53.312 --> 36:55.347
I'm not your mom.
Do what you want.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.986
I'm sorry. Come on.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.654
Grab your boots.
We'll go.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.774
Are you mad at me?

37:22.808 --> 37:24.042
What do you mean?

37:24.075 --> 37:26.912
You seemed mad when
I got out of the pool.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.514
[Sighs] No.

37:28.547 --> 37:32.318
I... I was mad at myself.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.919
Why?

37:33.952 --> 37:36.455
It's hard to explain.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.626
You like Butch,
don't you?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.894
Well, h-he's different,

37:42.928 --> 37:44.863
that's for sure.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.598
I think you like him.

37:46.632 --> 37:47.833
I didn't say that!

37:47.866 --> 37:49.801
Don't tell him
I said that.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.036
Why not?

37:51.069 --> 37:53.872
It's already
complicated enough.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.875
Does that mean
it's too hard
to explain, too?

37:56.908 --> 37:58.009
Definitely.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.945
Yeah.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.347
You know,
for a grown-up,

38:01.347 --> 38:02.781
you sure
can't explain much.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.983
You got that right.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.791
You know, Cotton,
I'm, um...

38:12.824 --> 38:15.927
I'm sorry about
what I said at the pool

38:15.961 --> 38:19.365
about not being your mother
and everything.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.566
It wasn't
very thoughtful.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.670
It's okay.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.872
I know you
didn't mean it.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.378
Looks pretty.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.079
Thanks.

38:34.112 --> 38:36.382
[Wind chimes tinkling]

38:39.785 --> 38:42.954
Cotton,
you have a bedtime?

38:42.988 --> 38:45.090
Uh-uh.

38:45.123 --> 38:48.059
But I'll go if you
sing me a lullaby.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.398
Please.

38:52.398 --> 38:53.399
[Sighs]

38:53.399 --> 38:54.400
Okay.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.801
Come here.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.540
Oh, shh.

39:04.576 --> 39:09.080
* Maybe I'll catch
that shooting star *

39:09.114 --> 39:13.819
* Just like
a firefly in a jar *

39:13.852 --> 39:16.422
* Close your eyes

39:16.422 --> 39:21.727
* Your dreams are
not that far away *

39:23.529 --> 39:25.831
Mommy used
to sing that me.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.566
Did she sing
to you, too?

39:27.599 --> 39:29.435
Mm-hmm.

39:29.468 --> 39:34.440
[Together]
* Maybe I'll meet
that cow on the moon *

39:34.440 --> 39:38.444
* Up in the clouds
there singing a tune *

39:38.477 --> 39:41.447
* The rest of the world
can sleep *

39:41.480 --> 39:43.515
* But, darling, you

39:43.549 --> 39:44.683
[laughs]

39:44.716 --> 39:48.754
* Were meant to dream.

39:56.027 --> 39:58.196
You okay?

39:58.229 --> 40:01.166
I got allergies.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.635
Come on.
I'll tuck you in bed.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.671
No. It's okay.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.540
I can
tuck myself in.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.675
Sure.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.642
Yeah. Night.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.915
Good night, honey.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.855
She blows me away.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.993
I had no idea.

40:34.700 --> 40:38.103
You have no idea how happy
she is that you're here.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.843
Can I ask you
a question?

40:44.876 --> 40:45.811
Sure.

40:48.514 --> 40:51.650
What did Morgan mean
by a washed-up has-been?

40:53.552 --> 40:56.221
I used to play
some football.

40:56.254 --> 40:57.923
Why'd you quit?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.729
This what you wanted?

41:03.762 --> 41:04.730
[Chuckles]

41:04.763 --> 41:05.897
This is what I needed.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.936
So what are you doing
for the Fourth?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.538
Oh, I don't know.

41:13.539 --> 41:14.840
Well, Joe Boy and I

41:14.873 --> 41:16.708
would consider it
a real honor

41:16.742 --> 41:20.211
if you'd like to join us
for the Fourth of July picnic.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.080
Um...

41:22.113 --> 41:24.950
if I'm still here,
I'll think about it.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.785
Still here?

41:26.818 --> 41:28.019
[Sighs]

41:28.053 --> 41:29.287
We'll see.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.656
Okay.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.192
Thanks for tonight.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.795
Sure. Anytime.

41:39.931 --> 41:40.866
Good night.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.647
You know, you could brush
your teeth once in a while.

41:55.681 --> 41:56.815
What?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.884
Ah, you don't
have to tell me.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.219
She doesn't know
if she's coming or going.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.754
And what does that say?

42:02.788 --> 42:05.323
[Snorts]

42:05.356 --> 42:07.793
I'm telling you
straight up.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.628
This one is dangerous.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.262
[Snorts]

42:11.296 --> 42:13.732
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're probably right.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.101
She'll do
the right thing, but...

42:16.134 --> 42:17.769
[snorts]

42:17.803 --> 42:21.306
All right, well, as long
as you're with me on this.

42:21.339 --> 42:24.209
Are you with me on this?

42:24.242 --> 42:27.278
I'm gonna take you
to the dentist.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.285
Early bird
getting the worm, huh?

42:34.319 --> 42:36.922
I just wanted to talk
to you before things
got set in your mind.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.323
About what?

42:38.356 --> 42:39.858
Sunny.

42:39.891 --> 42:40.859
What about her?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.260
You like her, don't you?

42:42.293 --> 42:44.329
Yeah, sure.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.131
I saw the way
you were looking at her

42:46.164 --> 42:47.633
at the pool
when she was singing.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.034
Well, she's a good singer.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.637
Oh, don't you lie to me.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.872
You like her,
and she likes you.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.974
Did she say that?

42:56.007 --> 42:57.909
No, but I know.

42:57.943 --> 42:58.977
Do you?

42:59.010 --> 43:01.012
Well, first off,

43:01.046 --> 43:02.914
I think y'all should
just tell each other

43:02.948 --> 43:04.215
instead of playing
those stupid games.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.752
Well, maybe we will
if we figure out we do.

43:06.785 --> 43:09.087
All I know is
Heather in my class

43:09.120 --> 43:10.756
liked this
boy named Connor,

43:10.789 --> 43:12.057
and she used
to whisper and giggle

43:12.090 --> 43:13.759
and do stupid stuff
with her friends,

43:13.792 --> 43:16.394
and he used to ignore her,

43:16.427 --> 43:18.664
and they never spoke
to each other.

43:18.697 --> 43:21.099
Well, what happened
to Heather and Connor?

43:22.868 --> 43:24.035
Connor moved.

43:24.069 --> 43:25.937
Tragedy
in the fourth grade.

43:25.971 --> 43:26.938
Yes.

43:26.972 --> 43:28.106
[Chuckles]

43:28.139 --> 43:30.776
I tell people
straight out how I feel.

43:30.809 --> 43:31.743
[Siren bloops]

43:33.178 --> 43:34.880
I know you do.

43:38.383 --> 43:41.152
Hi, Butch.
How's it going?

43:42.954 --> 43:43.955
It's going.

43:43.989 --> 43:47.358
Butch, I got a problem.

43:47.392 --> 43:50.696
Morgan's making me move
your postcard stand.

43:50.729 --> 43:53.965
Yeah, he came by here
the other day and
threw a hissy fit.

43:53.999 --> 43:58.336
Yeah. You're gonna
have to move it outside
of city limits.

43:58.369 --> 44:00.872
There's isn't
any traffic out there.

44:00.906 --> 44:04.042
Well, Butch,
there's no traffic
anywhere around here.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.044
BUTCH: Yeah,
you got a point.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.880
Shoot, I don't know
why you sit out here

44:08.914 --> 44:11.249
in the wind and
the sun for, anyway.

44:11.282 --> 44:14.352
You know,
people think you're crazy.

44:14.385 --> 44:16.387
I got my reasons.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.256
Well, they must be
some good ones.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.958
Morgan's a bully.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.727
Yeah, Morgan's a bully.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.795
Sorry, Butch.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.197
It's not your problem.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.108
Well, that sucks.

44:37.142 --> 44:39.110
Yeah, don't it?

44:39.144 --> 44:43.782
[Joe Boy neighs]

44:43.815 --> 44:46.785
Well, we both
see bright things
in your future.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.453
Oh, yeah?
What do you see?

44:48.486 --> 44:51.289
I'm not telling you.

44:51.322 --> 44:52.357
See you later.

44:52.390 --> 44:53.925
I gotta go.

44:53.959 --> 44:55.260
Where you going?

45:04.169 --> 45:06.004
What just happened?

45:07.472 --> 45:10.341
CRICKET: How much
you reckon is up there?

45:10.375 --> 45:11.943
Oh, I don't know.

45:11.977 --> 45:13.344
Maybe a grand or two.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.046
That ain't
gonna be enough.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.381
No. Really?

45:16.414 --> 45:18.049
So what's the point?

45:18.083 --> 45:19.985
Yeah, what's
the point, Ledball?

45:20.018 --> 45:22.187
You're just getting
dust in my beer.

45:22.220 --> 45:25.791
How much you reckon
I'd get for a dollar bill
signed by Janis Joplin?

45:25.791 --> 45:29.227
Whoa. You got a bill
signed by Janis Joplin?

45:29.260 --> 45:31.797
Well, one night,
she and I

45:31.830 --> 45:33.498
were running
around here in our
birthday suits,

45:33.531 --> 45:35.066
and she stuck it
up here.

45:35.100 --> 45:37.235
There was
a lot of Southern
Comfort involved,

45:37.268 --> 45:40.071
so I'm
not sure of exactly
where she put it.

45:40.105 --> 45:44.375
Lord, that's
near 40 years ago.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.112
Are you saying
that you and her...

45:49.147 --> 45:51.950
Eww.

45:51.983 --> 45:53.384
I ain't saying
nothing about no one,

45:53.418 --> 45:54.820
especially to you.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.022
Well, if it was
so damn important to you,

45:57.055 --> 45:58.489
why'd you
leave it up there?

45:58.523 --> 45:59.958
'Cause that's the deal.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.827
Well, it's stupid.
What's stupid?

46:01.860 --> 46:05.496
Ledball's looking
for a dollar bill
signed by Janis Joplin.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.198
Well, why is
that stupid?

46:07.232 --> 46:09.300
Well, because he's late
on his lease,

46:09.334 --> 46:12.237
and Morgan wants
to make us a bunch
of meatpackers.

46:13.504 --> 46:14.840
[Chuckles]

46:14.873 --> 46:15.907
Cricket,

46:15.941 --> 46:18.176
next time
you have a brain fart,

46:18.209 --> 46:19.444
seriously think
to yourself,

46:19.477 --> 46:22.047
"Do I really want
to say that?"

46:22.080 --> 46:25.150
And if you decide you do,
shut up anyway.

46:25.183 --> 46:27.853
Yeah,
he shut me down, too.

46:27.886 --> 46:30.221
Ah, bastard.

46:30.255 --> 46:31.890
What are you
gonna do?

46:33.324 --> 46:35.293
Well, I was
thinking about
setting up in here,

46:35.326 --> 46:37.362
but obviously that
ain't gonna work either.

46:37.395 --> 46:40.131
Paradise fading
by the dashboard
light.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.132
Who said that?

46:41.166 --> 46:42.400
How 'bout who cares?

46:42.433 --> 46:44.469
Nope. Wrong.

46:44.502 --> 46:47.172
Well, bitching ain't
gonna get the potato peeled
one way or the other.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.475
Yeah, but if this town
is truly gonna flourish,

46:50.508 --> 46:51.910
then we have to criticize,

46:51.943 --> 46:54.345
and if it's gonna
function as a whole,

46:54.379 --> 46:56.547
then we
have to have dissent.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.050
You want me
to cut you off?

46:59.084 --> 47:01.019
I'm just saying.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.923
Oh, my.

47:04.956 --> 47:06.424
[laughs]

47:06.457 --> 47:10.228
And here it is.

47:10.261 --> 47:12.263
What are you gonna
do with that now?

47:12.297 --> 47:14.966
I don't know.
I thought I'd
put it on eBay.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.902
There must be
some rich old boy

47:16.935 --> 47:18.436
who was
a Joplin fan.

47:18.469 --> 47:22.507
Keep Morgan
off my back
for a while.

47:22.540 --> 47:23.942
Sounds like a plan.

47:23.975 --> 47:24.943
Theoretically, yeah.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.445
Realistically,
probably not.

47:27.478 --> 47:30.982
And that's it.
You're done.

47:49.267 --> 47:50.501
Can I help you?

47:50.535 --> 47:52.603
Oh, hi.
I'm looking for Jackson.

47:53.972 --> 47:56.474
Hey, Jackson.

47:56.507 --> 47:59.044
You didn't have
to come all this
way to see me.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.578
I know you
ain't got a car.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.513
You could have
just called.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.950
There's a bar
around the corner.

48:04.950 --> 48:07.352
Um, that's
not why I'm here.

48:07.385 --> 48:10.121
[Cellphone rings]
No? Why are you here?

48:11.656 --> 48:13.524
I need a job.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.560
Excuse me?

48:15.593 --> 48:17.595
I need a job.

48:17.628 --> 48:20.231
Seems like money
puts food on the table.

48:20.265 --> 48:22.300
After everything that's
gone down between us,

48:22.333 --> 48:23.668
that's what
you're here for?

48:23.701 --> 48:25.136
Oh, this was a mistake.

48:25.170 --> 48:26.204
No, wait.

48:32.343 --> 48:35.646
Well, we don't need
any more salesmen or
assistants, and...

48:35.680 --> 48:39.417
I don't suppose you
know your way around
an engine, do you?

48:39.450 --> 48:40.718
No.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.687
Guess that
leaves janitor

48:42.720 --> 48:45.456
unless your hands
are too precious
for a mop.

48:45.490 --> 48:49.127
Nope. It's kind of
what I expected.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.996
Bucket's in the back.

48:56.201 --> 48:57.702
Who's that?

48:57.735 --> 48:59.370
Nobody.

48:59.404 --> 49:01.172
Uh-huh.

49:01.206 --> 49:03.374
Is nobody
working here now?

49:03.408 --> 49:04.609
Yep.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.477
Tammy ain't
gonna like that.

kiss my ass.

* They ring like stones
thrown into a canyon *

of each one slowly landing *

You didn't taste it.

I've ever heard the day

like that before.

Well, I'm gonna
go watch some TV

before I go to bed.

51:19.877 --> 51:21.312
I'll see you tomorrow.

in a little bit.

So, um, you want
to sit outside?

51:36.294 --> 51:38.796
I can grab some beers.
Great.

51:38.829 --> 51:41.166
Uh, I'll be right there.
I'm gonna turn
the stove off.

51:41.199 --> 51:42.833

as the eye can see."

to a new song.

52:17.835 --> 52:19.604

Yeah?

finish it.

52:29.880 --> 52:33.584
I should go.
I gotta take a shower.

go for a swim.

ever been married?

Really?

52:48.566 --> 52:49.600
Yeah.

52:49.634 --> 52:51.469
What happened?

52:51.502 --> 52:54.439
Guess we just kind of
grew out of each other.

52:54.472 --> 52:56.541
We met when
I was playing ball,

52:56.574 --> 53:00.411
and when I got out,
she wanted out.

53:00.445 --> 53:03.481
She left you
just because
you quit football?

53:05.416 --> 53:09.520
Well, to be fair, it wasn't
the program she bought into.

53:11.422 --> 53:13.758
What was
that program?

53:13.791 --> 53:16.827
The guy who
paints postcards
and plays guitar?

53:16.861 --> 53:18.363
Yeah, that one.

53:19.830 --> 53:21.599
Do you like
this program?

53:21.632 --> 53:23.601
More than I liked that one.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.570
What was wrong
with that one?

53:30.375 --> 53:31.809
There was this one game.

53:31.842 --> 53:34.712
It was the fourth quarter,
and the game was on the line.

yelling, fighting.

the line at the guy
I was playing against,

53:46.591 --> 53:48.659
and he had saliva
foaming at the mouth

53:48.693 --> 53:50.495
and blood
all over his uniform,

53:50.528 --> 53:52.029
and looked down
at my hands,

53:52.062 --> 53:55.300
and they're
bloody and broken.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.936
I start thinking,
"This is crazy."

53:58.969 --> 54:02.440
But my whole life had
been geared to this moment,

54:02.473 --> 54:06.311
just go down the field and
score the winning touchdown.

54:06.344 --> 54:07.745
I had this epiphany.

54:07.778 --> 54:09.614
What does it mean...

54:11.015 --> 54:14.319
a grown man trying to move
this piece of pigskin

54:14.352 --> 54:15.986
up and down
these white lines?

54:18.889 --> 54:22.327
It was over,
and I knew at that moment

54:22.360 --> 54:24.729
I was not
a football player anymore.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.341
SUNNY: Come on.
Be here. Be here.

54:36.341 --> 54:38.042
BUTCH:
What are you
looking for?

54:38.075 --> 54:39.844
Oh, yes. Still here.

54:39.877 --> 54:41.078
Tequila.
Oh, my God.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.480
I can't believe
it's still here.

54:42.513 --> 54:43.481
How... How old is it?

54:43.514 --> 54:44.849
Mmm. Really old,

54:44.882 --> 54:45.850
and it's good.

54:45.883 --> 54:46.917
[laughs]

54:46.951 --> 54:47.885
All right.

54:50.555 --> 54:51.489
Oh!

54:53.691 --> 54:55.025
Okay.

54:55.059 --> 54:57.462
Guess we're
dipping more
than our toes.

55:03.534 --> 55:04.602
Naked?

55:04.635 --> 55:05.670
Okay, I'm down.

55:12.109 --> 55:13.544
Come on!
I'm coming.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.616
[Squeals]

55:22.587 --> 55:23.921
Don't forget the tequila!

55:23.954 --> 55:25.956
Okay.
[laughs]

55:25.990 --> 55:27.592
Never leave
the bottle behind.

55:32.797 --> 55:34.432
Where...

55:34.465 --> 55:35.500
You gotta get
the tequila.

55:35.533 --> 55:36.467
I'll get it.

55:38.035 --> 55:40.405
How good does this feel?

55:40.405 --> 55:41.672
Hey, well,

55:41.706 --> 55:42.940
give me that thing.

55:42.973 --> 55:44.041
Here you go.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.576
[Chuckles]

55:47.712 --> 55:51.582
So, why haven't you
hooked up with anybody
since wifey?

55:51.616 --> 55:55.620
'Cause I haven't met anyone
since wifey. You?

55:55.653 --> 55:57.422
Mm...

55:57.455 --> 55:59.690
emotionally
unavailable.

55:59.724 --> 56:01.859
Heh. Perfect.

56:03.461 --> 56:04.729
[Sighs]

56:04.762 --> 56:07.565
So if we're gonna bare
our souls tonight,

56:07.598 --> 56:09.600
what happened
between you and Jackson?

56:09.634 --> 56:13.604
[Sighs]

56:13.638 --> 56:17.742
Well, um, one night,

56:17.775 --> 56:20.845
he was driving
after we'd been drinking,

56:20.878 --> 56:24.114
and he passed out
and hit a tree,

56:24.148 --> 56:27.485
and, um, I cracked
a vertebra.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.520
Oh.
Yeah.

56:29.554 --> 56:32.457
And found out
that at the time,

56:32.490 --> 56:34.625
I'd been pregnant.

56:34.659 --> 56:38.195
And Jackson called that
a cheap abortion.

56:38.228 --> 56:39.464
Oh, nice.

56:39.497 --> 56:40.498
Mm.

56:40.531 --> 56:42.199
And about the same time,

56:42.232 --> 56:45.803
Cotton's dad, my stepdad,

56:45.836 --> 56:47.505
dumped my mom,

56:47.538 --> 56:48.906
and, um...

56:48.939 --> 56:51.208
And I... I don't know.

56:51.241 --> 56:57.081
I just... I guess I realized
that I was gonna have a life

56:57.114 --> 57:01.486
just like my mom
if I didn't get out of here,

57:01.486 --> 57:04.889
and so I got on a bus
and went to L.A.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.592
So why did you
come back?

57:07.625 --> 57:09.727
Well...

57:09.760 --> 57:11.896
I got...

57:11.929 --> 57:14.965
I got Cotton's
last postcard.

57:14.999 --> 57:17.635
I think it was
the 17th postcard,

57:17.668 --> 57:22.039
and, um... and she said

57:22.072 --> 57:25.743
that Lois didn't have
many days left

57:25.776 --> 57:29.046
and maybe I could come home
and stay with her,

57:29.079 --> 57:31.048
and...

57:32.917 --> 57:35.620
I realized that...

57:37.755 --> 57:43.528
I needed to come back
and... and face my mom.

57:43.528 --> 57:45.563
[Crying]
Yeah.

57:48.265 --> 57:50.835
And I missed her by a day.

57:50.868 --> 57:52.837
I'm so sorry.

58:12.256 --> 58:14.124
Maybe we should go.

58:24.802 --> 58:26.571
Think she's
still asleep?

58:26.571 --> 58:27.738
I hope so.

58:32.710 --> 58:34.912
Sorry I'm so crazy.

58:36.647 --> 58:38.215
There's nothing crazy
about you.

58:41.118 --> 58:42.987
Night.

58:43.020 --> 58:44.589
Night.

58:58.368 --> 59:00.270
Sunny, don't do it.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.943
[Music playing]

59:05.976 --> 59:08.112
[Overlapping chatter]

59:16.386 --> 59:18.789
[Cheering]

59:23.227 --> 59:26.096
* When you touched
a friend of mine *

59:28.032 --> 59:30.034
* I thought
I would lose my mind... *

59:30.067 --> 59:31.368
BUTCH: Hey, how 'bout
right here, y'all?

59:31.401 --> 59:32.837
Oh, perfect.
Yeah?

59:32.870 --> 59:34.104
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

59:34.138 --> 59:36.674
Hey, Judy, would you
watch Joe Boy?

59:36.707 --> 59:38.175
Oh, sure.
I'm gonna go play.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.309
Okay.
Okay.

59:39.343 --> 59:40.811
I'll see you later.

59:46.684 --> 59:47.652
Hey, Bubba!

59:47.685 --> 59:49.186
Hey, Sunny!

59:49.219 --> 59:51.388
How 'bout we set up
with y'all here?

59:51.421 --> 59:52.790
That's fine with me.

59:52.823 --> 59:54.925
BUTCH: Here, let me
help you with that.

59:54.959 --> 59:58.228
[Groans]

59:58.262 --> 59:59.830
Ow. My...

59:59.864 --> 01:00:01.666
Did you sell
that dollar?

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:05.369
Oh, Bubba,
you know, some old boy
came in for a beer.

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:08.639
I wasn't paying attention.
I give it away in change.

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.942
Don't get very high marks
for my handling of money.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:15.079
[Chuckles]

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.882
And, Merlin,
what'd you bring?

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.349
Nothing.
There's always enough.

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:21.185
Sandbagging?
Tree shading?

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.352
Not even a beer?

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:23.353
Well,
what'd you bring?

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.689
Two cases.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:25.990
And that's not
gonna be enough.

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:27.291
Listen,
all I know is

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.159
the day's over
when the beer
runs out.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:30.427
Can I have one?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.863
Thank you, señor.
Thank you.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.365
Ledball.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:36.767
Hey, sweetheart.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.769
You gotta hear
my sister sing.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:39.770
Really, sweetheart?

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:41.071
Yep.
Yeah?

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.908
And you'll know
what I mean when you hear.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.309
[Chuckles]
Come on.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.376
Butch.
Yeah?

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.913
Play something
so Sunny can sing.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:51.816
Uh, why don't
we just sit down
and eat something

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.250
and relax a little bit
first, huh?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.251
You hungry, Cotton?

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.086
No. I want to
hear you sing.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.421
Well, I'd like
to hear you sing.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:58.789
You want
to hear her sing?

01:00:58.823 --> 01:00:59.790
Yes.
Can't wait.

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.358
CRICKET:
Yes, I do.

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:03.828
I don't want
to sing right now.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:04.862
Will you later?

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:05.830
Please?

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:10.034
Maybe.

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.269
Promise.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:13.738
We'll see.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.906
Sit down,
and get some food.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.943
Here. Eat some
of your salty slaw
you made last night.

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:19.910
[Chuckles]

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:24.348
Here. I got
a fork for you.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.852
* Ohh, yes

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:30.254
* I'm not ready

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:32.757
* I'm not ready

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.259
* I'm not ready

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.862
* Oh, yes

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:39.897
* I'm not ready

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.166
* I'm not ready

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:47.237
* Oh, ready...

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:50.107
You.
Watch it, missy.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.475
What?

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.509
Don't "what" me!

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.944
I know
what you're up to.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:55.946
And what is that?

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.382
Jackson told me
how you came
to beg him for a job.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:01:59.850
And don't think
that you're

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.351
gonna weasel your way
back into his life.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:02.352
He's with me now.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:04.889
Uh, I'm sorry, Tammy, but...

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:07.357
And if I catch you
trying something,

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:08.392
I'll kill you.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.330
Now get out of my way.
I have to piss.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:22.807
[Sighs]

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.376
What ya doing?

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.378
Nice girlfriend.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.848
Ah, she's harmless.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:34.318
Harmless
in a homicidal way.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.954
What you doing
with Butch?

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:38.823
Enjoying the day.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.193
You and I,
we've got

01:02:43.227 --> 01:02:44.461
some unfinished
business.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:47.264
[Sighs]
Get your hands off me.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.333
Be happy
with what you got.

01:02:57.407 --> 01:03:00.845
You could have
brought at least
a twelver.

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:02.479
Enough, Cricket.

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.215
Where's Sunny?

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:07.451
Oh, she'll be back
in a minute.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:13.590
What's wrong?

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.426
Nothing.
Are we leaving?

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.962
I guess.

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:20.530
Well, aren't you guys
gonna play a song now?

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:21.866
I think we're leaving.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.268
No.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.036
No, no, no, no, no. Now.

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:28.172
Now is the time.
Now is the time.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.474
Come on. Come on here,
because Sunny's gonna sing!

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.476
Why are you
acting like this?

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:34.144
Because of my dream.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.013
I saw you guys
playing last night,

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:37.514
and you have
to play now!

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:41.151
I... I really don't
feel like singing.

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:44.454
Maybe another time,
okay?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.156
You can't go now.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.993
Aw, sweet pea,
it's getting late.

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:51.395
But you haven't
heard them sing,

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.230
and there's
gonna be fireworks.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.965
Beer's all gone,
little sister.

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:56.433
That means
the party's over.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.602
You could at least
bring a sixer.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.470
Cricket, you might
have a problem.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.506
Yeah, you drank
all my beer.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:05.910
Hey, maybe we do it
another time, all right?

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.914
Why is it so important
that we play right now?

01:04:09.914 --> 01:04:12.082
It just is.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.120
You'll see.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:18.088
I don't know.

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:20.090
But I know.

01:04:20.124 --> 01:04:22.459
Come on, you can
just sing that song

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.528
that you were singing
in the shower.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.430
They'll love it.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.367
Whatever you
want to do.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.038
Okay.

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:35.305
Okay?

I want, like,
six million more

01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:49.705
That's all?

01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:58.514
All right.

01:26:58.547 --> 01:26:59.582

See you later.

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:14.297

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:18.734

to ask first.

Do you want to?

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:25.308
I do.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.314
When I get married,

01:27:31.314 --> 01:27:33.449
I'm gonna have
eight kids,

01:27:33.482 --> 01:27:35.384
eight cats
and eight dogs...

01:27:35.418 --> 01:27:36.752

01:27:46.028 --> 01:27:48.897
Well, you already take care
of a lot of people.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.933
You know that?

01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:52.034
Really?

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:53.035
Oh, yeah.

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.604

01:27:57.873 --> 01:27:59.408
You know, I...

01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:03.879
I never told you thank you
for saving my life.

Thank you.

Butch says hard times
teach us things

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:10.919
we need to know
about ourselves.

01:28:12.821 --> 01:28:14.723
Yeah.

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:18.394
Still, I'm sorry...

01:28:19.895 --> 01:28:23.366
sorry about all the hard stuff
you have to go through.

01:28:28.604 --> 01:28:31.674
You know, I thought
about you all the time
when I was in L.A.

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:35.711
I wondered if you did.

01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:37.613
Well, I did.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:40.549
You know we... we have
different fathers, right?

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:42.985
Yeah. Mama told me.

01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:45.921
That doesn't mean
you're less of a sister.

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:47.623
You either.

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.394

I'll never
leave you again.

we've been looking for. Yeah.

This is
a special circumstance,

01:32:51.634 --> 01:32:54.202
and we'll be bending
some rules here tonight.

01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:57.973
Do you understand
how serious the
situation is here?

01:32:59.141 --> 01:33:02.144
Yeah. I think
we all do.

01:33:02.177 --> 01:33:04.246

Are you his wife?

Hi.

Dr. Enzler.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.218
I'm Dr. Enzler.

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:11.787
Sunny,
as you know,

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.989
he's had
a very serious
brain injury.

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:16.825
Now, we've done
a procedure to relieve
some of the pressure,

01:33:16.859 --> 01:33:18.727
but when
the brain's injured,
it swells,

01:33:18.761 --> 01:33:20.696
and the swelling causes
additional damage.

01:33:20.729 --> 01:33:24.032
How much,
we don't know yet.

01:33:24.066 --> 01:33:25.968
We tried
to stabilize him,

01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:28.704
but the next 12 hours
are gonna be critical.

01:33:28.737 --> 01:33:30.873
Meaning?

01:33:30.906 --> 01:33:34.109
Meaning we're
doing everything
we can for him.

01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:35.778
I think it's all right
if they stay.

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.687
Hey, Sunny...

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:48.223
you need anything,

01:33:48.256 --> 01:33:49.391
anything at all,

01:33:49.424 --> 01:33:51.727

right outside, okay?

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:55.698
I need him.

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:05.040

in the ice cream

be okay?

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:18.086
What's the ballpark
for how long
he's gonna be...

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.187
What did they say?

01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.756

any word from...

01:54:55.522 --> 01:54:58.692
* The rest of the way

01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:01.195
* With my imperfections

01:55:01.228 --> 01:55:04.966
* And the stupid things I say

01:55:06.167 --> 01:55:08.569
* Look for me

01:55:10.371 --> 01:55:13.107
* Look for me

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.676
* Sometime tomorrow

01:55:17.244 --> 01:55:19.313
* Look for me

01:55:19.346 --> 01:55:22.449
* Oh, I know it's hard

01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:26.553
* Look for me

01:55:26.587 --> 01:55:29.623
* Coming down your road

01:55:31.225 --> 01:55:33.494
* Look at me

01:55:33.527 --> 01:55:37.331
* I'm growing old

01:55:37.364 --> 01:55:40.401
* I love you so

01:55:41.305 --> 01:55:47.872
