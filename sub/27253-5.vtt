01:22.960 --> 01:26.600
Cousin! I did not expect to see you here.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.040
I've just come from Florence.
The Signoria have banished me.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.280
They've thrown out all our brokers too.
Everyone who worked for us.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.920
I'm sorry to hear that.
We will find you a new position.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.120
Albizzi has the government
in a stranglehold.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.800
Mercenaries terrorize the streets.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.760
What is Albizzi doing hiring mercenaries?

01:44.840 --> 01:46.600
Strengthening his position.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.920
You must persuade His Serenity to act.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.040
Or soon there will be nothing left
of our city.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.840
I know what I must do, brother.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.760
The Council of Venice has been called

02:16.840 --> 02:19.280
to confirm the presence
of Cosimo de' Medici,

02:19.360 --> 02:21.600
exile of the State of Florence.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.680
The Florentine Signoria
have rejected your demand

02:24.760 --> 02:27.680
to return to the city of Florence.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.240
Furthermore, they have extended
your exile from five to ten years.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.800
The court will see you again in one month.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.800
Thank you, Messer Medici. You may go.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.360
The Council calls Paolo De Sabbata,
exile of the Papal States--

02:41.440 --> 02:44.640
If I may, I have a question.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.560
Did they provide a reason
for this inhumanity?

02:49.640 --> 02:52.080
Ten more days is unacceptable,
let alone ten years.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.080
Sanuto.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.480
The Signoria doubt
your character and intention.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.080
The Signoria? Or Rinaldo degli Albizzi?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.800
Messer Medici...

03:07.920 --> 03:12.760
We wish we could do more to repay
the kindness you have shown our city.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.000
It is a great injustice,
and we are sorry for it.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.920
Of course.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.920
Florence is an ally to Venice,
you are bound by the rules of diplomacy,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.560
but what good is an ally
weakened by a despot?

03:28.960 --> 03:32.040
Our ambassadors will represent you
as best we can,

03:32.120 --> 03:34.520
but more than that is beyond us.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.080
You may go.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.040
Medici is used to getting
whatever he wants.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.320
- He won't let this matter lie.
- Don't worry, Your Serenity.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.920
It is all in hand.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.320
-Madonna Medici.
-I gather you don't have good news.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.000
Fifty more mercenaries
are coming from Livorno.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.480
Someone must stand up to him!

04:27.560 --> 04:31.680
Albizzi punishes anyone who speaks out
with levies and confiscation.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.000
--You! All of you!

04:35.080 --> 04:36.680
Come on!

04:40.480 --> 04:44.840
Madonna, you should leave the city.
It's not safe.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.360
Let me petition your husband.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.080
If he could see what Florence has become,
he wouldn't leave you here.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.800
I appreciate the thought, Ricciardo,
but that is not your concern.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.280
Come, Emilia.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.680
Your Serenity.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.400
Thank you for your invitation.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.920
Your naughty wife
stole ten ducats from me last night.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.080
Oh, please, Jacopo. I won them fairly.
Then you fell asleep in your soup.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.200
You see, she admits it.
Stolen from an unconscious man.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.440
You should have been with us,
then she might have behaved herself.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.160
I have no skill at cards.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.840
Lack of skill has never stopped me
from doing anything.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.480
There's a ball tomorrow night.
You must come.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.680
Come. We have wine and music for you.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.280
I envy you.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.480
Your son is a testament to you.
Mine, on the other hand is--

05:52.560 --> 05:55.360
- A lively young man.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.760
No matter how much wealth
or power one accumulates,

05:58.840 --> 06:01.720
there comes a time when it must pass
to the next generation.

06:01.800 --> 06:06.360
I see only folly and ruin in his future.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.600
Come.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.760
I hope you understand about the Council.
There are limits, even to our power.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.880
Mm.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.720
Isn't she exquisite?
My latest acquisition.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.680
A cynic might argue the Council is happy
its ambassadors failed.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.080
The wealth of my family enriches Venice.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.080
I understand your frustration.
Florence is like a mother to you.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.280
You long to return to her.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.680
But you should...
you should look around you.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.960
Venice is the most elegant city in Europe.
Enjoy it.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.680
Now, I know you love art.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.600
My great passion is music!

07:16.160 --> 07:19.040
She likes you, my friend. I'm jealous.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.840
You again?

07:44.920 --> 07:47.920
Visconti's Milanese spies are everywhere.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.760
I've been ordered to report
on all comings and goings.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.000
We both know you won't.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.520
Open.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.400
- Marco Bello.
- Madonna.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.080
-Emilia, fetch him some wine.
-Of course.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.280
-How are my family?
-In good health.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.840
-And my husband?
-The same.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.600
If you're here, that means the Council
have denied his demand

08:25.680 --> 08:26.840
to appeal in person.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.160
The Doge pretends to help the Medici
while doing nothing to lift the exile.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.200
Does my husband realize
what's happening here?

08:34.320 --> 08:37.440
The damage Albizzi is doing
will not be easily undone.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.040
He needs information.

08:40.560 --> 08:43.200
- Something to use against Albizzi.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.480
How am I to do that
when I am shunned by all my acquaintance?

08:48.560 --> 08:51.240
No one will speak to me.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.760
Surely you understand my position.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.760
He shows faith in you
to make such a request.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.120
He's counting on you.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.400
I must return to Venice
as soon as possible.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.360
Of course.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.400
Before you leave,
I have some things I want you to take.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.720
What is this?

09:29.120 --> 09:32.160
Plans for a vast new library
for the monks at San Giorgio.

09:34.160 --> 09:38.480
Michelozzo wants to emulate
the ancients, in proportion and symmetry.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.320
It will be the finest in Europe.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.040
My gift to Venice.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.560
I'm overwhelmed.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.280
I trust you on your word
that you are working on my behalf,

09:51.360 --> 09:55.160
and I am very grateful.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.320
He doesn't deserve a single brick.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.640
He has no intention of helping us.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.520
But he wants us to believe
he's our friend.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.400
Then why not challenge the hypocrite

10:02.480 --> 10:05.280
to match his words of friendship
with actual deeds?

10:05.360 --> 10:07.600
This gift of yours
is going to cost us a fortune.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.480
Are you giving me a lecture
on the evils of extravagance?

10:10.560 --> 10:11.720
News travels fast.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.760
While Florence suffers under Albizzi,
let her see your philanthropy.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.640
But how many years will it take to build?
We cannot wait that long, Cosimo.

10:18.720 --> 10:22.160
Cousin. What's the matter?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.400
What I'm about to tell you
can't leave this room.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.600
We're listening.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.320
I have been approached
by Duke Visconti's envoy.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.800
He wished me to convey
a secret offer to you.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.400
The use of his army.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.000
His army?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.360
-Whatever for?
-To retake Florence, of course.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.760
[You'd need to flee the city
to meet the army

10:54.840 --> 10:56.360
beyond the Venitian territories.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.000
From there, you'd march on Florence.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.760
Take the city by force--

11:00.840 --> 11:02.800
And become puppets
under Visconti's authority,

11:02.880 --> 11:05.040
hated by our own people
for siding with their enemy?

11:05.120 --> 11:08.760
No, Visconti's intentions are to destroy
the alliance between Venice and Florence.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.960
-He would leave Florence to us?
-Yes.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.960
But would he?

11:13.040 --> 11:16.560
There is something to be said
for direct action.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.480
Brother, diplomacy has failed.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.000
We cannot buy our way to freedom.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.360
Visconti has Sforza as his general.
They're a mighty force.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.240
If we are discovered
at any point by Venice,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.120
we will be executed
for colluding with Milan.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.160
If we do manage to escape
the city somehow and join the forces,

11:32.240 --> 11:35.640
there's a chance we'd be defeated,
then killed by our own people.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.280
And if we do not act now,
we may never get another chance.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.880
Contessina?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.320
Contessina de' Bardi?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.320
It's de' Medici now.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.960
You are exactly the same.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.080
I doubt that. It's been many years.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.480
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
I heard you were in Venice.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.360
-I'm sorry for your misfortune.
-Thank you.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.160
My family are in Venice.
As you see, I remain here.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.480
-And you? Are you still in Mantua?
-For my sins.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.680
-What brings you here?
-My family.

12:42.920 --> 12:43.920
You're married.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.280
My brother's family.
I am as I ever was, unmarried.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.480
I'd like to see you while I'm here.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.000
I'm afraid that's unlikely.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.320
It's nice to see you
looking so well, Ezio.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.760
After all these years.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.120
The mistress was afraid of looting.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.040
I think Lucrezia will have more use
for these than I.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.000
-What is it?
-Your wife sends you all her belongings

13:44.080 --> 13:45.360
for safekeeping.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.680
Florence is a rough place
for a woman on her own.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.800
Surely she has suffered enough.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.840
We are all suffering, Marco.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.640
Does she have everything she needs?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.080
Yes.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.240
Madonna, Signor Contarini.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.560
Surely you have servants
to do this for you.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.000
I like doing it.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.400
What are you doing here, Ezio?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.160
As blunt as ever, I see.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.760
I come with an invitation for supper.

14:41.840 --> 14:46.800
-I'm afraid that's not possible.
-Oh, no? Many previous engagements?

14:47.880 --> 14:51.320
-I'm a married woman.
-Even married women must eat.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.320
There's a supper hosted by the Pazzi.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.640
You must know the Pazzi
have no love for my family.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.280
Well, they may not like your husband

14:59.360 --> 15:03.120
but how can they hold anything
against you?

15:03.200 --> 15:06.640
And besides, you will be my guest.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.920
It will be a small affair,
a number of families.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.440
Guadagni, the Albizzi...

15:11.520 --> 15:13.280
-The Albizzi?
-Yes.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.880
-What's the occasion?
-Albizzi is quite close to my brother.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.080
Come. I hate to think of you alone here.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.840
-Very well.
-You will?

15:28.920 --> 15:31.320
I thought I'd have to do much more
to convince you.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.600
You've mellowed.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.000
I can still change my mind.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.040
Then I'll take my leave before you do.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.320
Look what your mother has sent me.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.960
Aren't they beautiful?

15:52.040 --> 15:55.240
Surely it's a sign
that she'll soon be with us.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.560
-What's the matter?
-Ten years.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.680
How can we possibly stay here
for ten years?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.640
She's not coming.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.320
Father wants her to stay in Florence.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.960
I don't know when we'll next see her.

16:33.440 --> 16:37.560
-Then I can't possibly wear any of this.
-Of course you can.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.720
That's what she'd want.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.600
And you once told me...

16:45.680 --> 16:47.800
"Pearls must be worn
or they loose their luster."

16:48.840 --> 16:50.160
That's true.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.160
I'll wear them for the ball tonight.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.400
You will come, won't you?

17:00.160 --> 17:02.280
-Go without me.
-Oh, please, come.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.960
Perhaps you'll feel better
once you're in company.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.080
No, I have correspondence
from Florence to answer.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.920
My father's relying on me.

17:34.360 --> 17:38.760
I believe you all know my guest.
Contessina de' Medici.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.320
Come. Join us.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.120
Messer Contarini, I believe you're
acquainted with Contessina de' Medici.

17:59.200 --> 18:04.240
Of course. Though when I knew her,
she was Contessina de' Bardi.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.240
You and my brother
were always thick as thieves.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.760
-My daughter, Isabella.
-Madonna.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.360
-Signor Guadagni.
-Contessina.

18:22.200 --> 18:26.520
I've always admired the Bardi.
A noble family.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.000
Your father was a true gentleman.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.520
How would he have felt about you
being abandoned by your husband?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.200
No one has been abandoned.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.600
Besides, my father always encouraged me
to count my blessings.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.080
- Many suffer in this city right now.
- It's unfortunate.

18:49.160 --> 18:54.720
-But reform begins with upheaval.
-Reform suggests progress.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.360
Surely you strive for a return
to the old order.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.600
That's why I like you, Contessina.
You have a shrewd mind.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.560
But as you will come to realize,
society functions best

19:12.640 --> 19:15.600
when everyone knows their place.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.040
If your husband knew that,
perhaps he'd still be here.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.840
Instead, he misses out on your beauty.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.520
Don't you agree with me, Contarini?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.160
What a splendid occasion.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.880
You know, at this very moment,
the Guilds are meeting.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.160
There is great dissatisfaction
among their ranks.

19:55.280 --> 20:00.120
Signor Guadagni...
this is a social gathering in my home.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.760
-No politics, please.
-As you wish.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.240
But it's best
that you are informed of this.

20:08.360 --> 20:12.240
While we dine in luxury,
the common man is suffering.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.240
You may want to reconsider
your allegiances.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.320
My niece and Ormanno
appear inseparable.

20:25.040 --> 20:30.000
Look at them. And it seems like yesterday
that we were that age.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.040
I remember thinking myself
something of a poet.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.920
I wrote you several heartfelt verses,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I went to your window to read them,
and how was I repaid in my efforts?

20:40.080 --> 20:42.080
- With a bucket of slops.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.000
No mercy, still.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.600
- Your rhymes were terrible.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.400
They remind me of us.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.120
I almost won you over, though. Didn't I?

21:00.680 --> 21:01.840
Almost.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.720
Cover yourself.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.400
It's impolite to refuse a gift.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.800
A gift? From whom?

21:51.880 --> 21:53.480
His Serenity, the Doge.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.040
I'm married. Get dressed and leave.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.200
-What are these?
-Plans.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.360
-For what?
-The library I'm building.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.640
It's beautiful.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.520
How much would you pay
for something like this?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.680
Around 15,000 ducats.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.520
For that, you could buy 15 of me.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.920
-I'd rather have the gold.
-What would you spend the money on?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.080
Food.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.760
What good are books and the art
to the hungry?

22:56.880 --> 23:01.120
-What is it?
-You just reminded me of someone.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.000
What will they do
if I return you to the palace?

23:15.040 --> 23:19.160
-Will they beat you?
-They won't be happy.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.160
You stay here tonight.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.800
I'll find another room.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.800
-What are you looking for?
-Architectural plans for a large dome.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.840
For the Cathedral in Florence.
I need it for reference.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.560
Is this it?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.360
Yes.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.000
It looks so real!

24:33.080 --> 24:35.520
It's a trick. Magic.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.600
Not magic, no.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.960
An illusion of sorts. Perspective.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.640
This is what you call the vanishing point.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.480
All the lines in the drawing
radiate from it.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.080
Pick any object, this pillar, for example.

25:00.160 --> 25:04.320
See all the horizontal lines
relate to that one single point.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.160
That's how the illusion is... created.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.000
Our cousin is here.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.280
She is a present of the Doge.
We were discussing perspective.

25:23.360 --> 25:28.160
You know, I don't quite think that's what
the Doge intended with his "gift."

25:32.440 --> 25:35.440
- Mario.
- I've had word from Milan.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.960
Duke Visconti needs your answer urgently.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.480
Then we must confirm our intent.

25:40.560 --> 25:44.000
-And how much time do we have?
-His envoy said two days.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.880
What would you do?
If you were in my position.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.800
I would trust my instincts.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.080
-And what if they have fallen silent?
-Surely that in itself is telling.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.280
"A good decision
is based on knowledge."

26:04.040 --> 26:05.240
Plato.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.520
I need you to deliver this
into the hands of Duke Visconti.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.920
You want me to go to Milan.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.760
Speak your mind. You have a talent for it.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.320
The Doge's spies are watching me.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.720
If they know that you are communicating
with the Duke of Milan,

26:23.800 --> 26:26.960
you'll be strung up in the square
as a traitor.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.240
And so will I.

26:29.320 --> 26:34.240
Then since we both value our necks,
ensure you are not seen.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.840
Plato. Wasn't he put to death for treason?

26:39.920 --> 26:42.960
-No, that was Socrates.
-Ah.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.560
Speak with no one but the Duke.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.880
I promise I haven't brought you poetry.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.840
Though your maid looks as if she'd be
happy to pelt me with slops.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.160
Emilia doesn't trust strangers.
She's protective of me.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.640
You don't need protecting.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.240
I've witnessed the way
you're treated in this city.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.560
You're the strongest woman I know.

27:17.640 --> 27:21.120
-I have little choice.
-You could indulge in self-pity.

27:21.200 --> 27:25.200
But you've always been selfless.
Even as a little girl.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.000
-I was headstrong.
-Hmm.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.880
You know I caused my father
no end of worry.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.840
But you obeyed him when it came to us.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.600
Against my wishes.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.840
I was sure you'd come that night.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.680
I waited for you
outside your father's house.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.240
I'm sorry. I shouldn't speak of it.
I don't mean to upset you.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.560
I wanted to go with you.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.240
-I waited all night.
-I had everything packed.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.200
Then my father told me
I was to marry Cosimo.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.760
If I'd gone, it would have destroyed him.
I couldn't do it.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.160
-I understand if you hate me for it.
-Hate you?

28:14.760 --> 28:19.600
Perhaps I hate what's become of you,
but I could never hate you.

28:22.920 --> 28:28.000
In truth, since I saw you
at the church that morning,

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
I realized I've never stopped loving you.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.440
Ezio, we can't.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.760
Fate wasn't kind to us before,
but it's different now.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.160
I'm not the man I was.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.480
I have the means to take you
anywhere you want to go.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.000
I'll be leaving here soon,
once the engagement has been arranged.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.120
-Come with me.
-The engagement?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.000
My niece to the Albizzi boy.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.640
Will you come with me?

29:28.280 --> 29:31.000
What's going on?

29:31.080 --> 29:33.120
I received this from Contessina.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.600
Can you leave us, please?

29:57.960 --> 30:01.440
Albizzi is marrying off his son
to Isabella Contarini in secret.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.200
Contessina has done well
to get us this information.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.000
The Contarini's bank with us in Mantua.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.440
They've grown wealthy on the profits
from their leather business.

30:09.520 --> 30:14.120
That wealth will soon be Albizzi's
and he will spend it on more mercenaries.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.960
-He must be stopped.
-Hmm.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.360
-Then it will take a war.
-Not necessarily.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.120
Well?

30:34.880 --> 30:37.720
I've never known a man
to resist your charms.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.840
He's being very careful.

30:43.360 --> 30:47.080
You've been within his household
for days. You must have heard something.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.560
We know he's scheming.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.720
You must give me more time.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.200
I have nothing of substance for you yet.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.760
You are rapidly losing your value,
Maddalena.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.240
It would be a shame
to have to ruin your beauty as well.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.080
Medici.

31:33.160 --> 31:36.120
You look tired.
I trust you enjoyed my gift.

31:36.200 --> 31:40.760
-Ah, I thank you.
-She's a favorite of mine.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.480
Your Serenity, I might have a solution
for the conundrum with your son.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.960
A banker doesn't make an offer
without the chance of a good return.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.000
What is your price for this?

31:52.080 --> 31:55.760
Your continued support
for my return to Florence.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.400
Go on.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.840
Massimo Contarini is about to make
a bad match for his daughter.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.680
If you were to offer
your son's hand instead,

32:05.760 --> 32:08.680
it could be of some benefit to us all.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.040
The Contarini of Mantua?

32:18.080 --> 32:21.000
He has made a fortune from leather goods.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.720
Imagine the profit that you could make,

32:22.800 --> 32:26.720
with your influence and importers here
and his factories in Mantua.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.960
Such a fortune
would keep your family comfortable

32:30.040 --> 32:32.400
within these walls for quite some time,
I would imagine.

32:32.480 --> 32:38.000
-To whom is the Contarini girl betrothed?
-Hmm. Ormanno degli Albizzi.

32:48.560 --> 32:53.640
You are foolish in coming here.
Right outside the Doge's palace.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.040
I'm very sorry, Cosimo.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.520
Do you have an answer for the Duke?
His messenger grows impatient.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.560
He must have word by tomorrow
or it will be too late.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.040
He will have word tomorrow.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.880
You won't believe what just happened.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.040
So, we decided to go to San Marco
to see the fireworks.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.080
You must've heard them.
There was an awful crowd.

33:23.520 --> 33:27.400
Well, one moment we are on the Rialto,
the next, Jacopo is in the canal!

33:27.480 --> 33:31.400
I thought I'd die. I lost a shoe.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.160
-He's a drunkard.
-He's been very kind to me.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.480
Are you jealous?

33:44.200 --> 33:46.480
Do you really doubt me?

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
No.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.360
But how can you enjoy yourself here?

33:54.560 --> 33:59.000
In this place we don't belong?
It seems heartless.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.400
This is our home now.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.800
And it will be,
at least for a decade more.

34:07.360 --> 34:12.160
As hard as it is, that's the reality.
And we must learn to fit in.

34:12.240 --> 34:15.160
I don't want to fit in!

34:15.240 --> 34:16.640
I want to go back too.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.520
But, my love, how are we going to do that?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.920
I don't know.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.200
But my father's working on it.
I'm working on it.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.480
-How?
-I'm petitioning members of the Signoria.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.000
Don't you understand?

34:34.080 --> 34:37.160
Albizzi holds the Signoria
in an iron grip.

34:37.240 --> 34:40.200
-It is of no use.
-I've got to do something!

34:40.280 --> 34:42.160
It's better than giving up.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.640
When my family were exiled,

34:51.800 --> 34:54.920
my father was consumed by grief.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.160
He grew obsessed with returning.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.680
And he died before we were allowed to.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.400
I watched him waste away in false hope.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.800
I can't do that again, Piero.

35:14.600 --> 35:15.880
And I won't.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.360
Massimo!

35:30.440 --> 35:34.080
-Uncle, tell him to let me stay.
-Brother, where are you going?

35:34.160 --> 35:36.600
We've had an offer
from the Doge of Venice.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.760
I have rescinded
our agreement with Albizzi.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.120
And I fear for Isabella's safety.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.600
In you get, my dear.

35:45.680 --> 35:49.600
-Will you join us?
-I have some business to attend to.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.720
Your brother leaves
when we had an agreement.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.400
How does the Doge know of the match?

35:58.480 --> 36:02.920
Someone betrayed my confidence,
someone got word to Medici.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.480
He has the ear of the Doge.

36:12.360 --> 36:16.840
When I find out who broke my trust,
there will be consequences.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.560
The Duke's messenger awaits our response.
We cannot delay it any longer.

36:46.640 --> 36:51.640
I'm sorry. I tried to reason with him.
But the army needs its orders.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.920
He will have his answer.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.200
Once we have presented
to the Doge and his Council.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.520
Where is Marco Bello?
Why hasn't he returned?

37:00.600 --> 37:04.480
We must go in.
We've kept the Doge waiting long enough.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.280
Cosimo!

37:37.520 --> 37:40.000
- Visconti knew nothing of the scheme.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.520
You have been tricked.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.040
The Council has been called to confirm
the presence of Cosimo de' Medici,

37:50.120 --> 37:52.600
exile of the State of Florence.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.640
I am your humble servant.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.240
Your presence has been confirmed.
You may depart.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.840
If I may,
I have a few words for the Council.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.720
Proceed, my friend.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.600
Since I have been a guest
of this republic,

38:19.680 --> 38:23.280
I have only known
your generosity and kindness.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.320
Which makes what I am about to say
all the more troubling.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.880
Days ago, I was made an offer
by an agent of your enemy, Milan.

38:32.960 --> 38:36.160
It was put to me that I might flee
the city to join Visconti's army,

38:36.240 --> 38:38.960
and from there
we might take the city of Florence.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.160
I feel it is my duty
as a loyal citizen of Florence

38:42.240 --> 38:45.040
and a grateful guest of this republic
that I relay this to you...

38:45.120 --> 38:47.080
Why did you hesitate?

38:47.160 --> 38:49.560
Surely Medici
should have confessed sooner.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.720
Days ago, you said.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.640
I beg your mercy.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.640
And mercy for the agent
that contacted me, he...

39:05.320 --> 39:07.520
He stands beside me.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.760
My cousin... Mario de' Medici.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.360
Arrest him!

39:24.200 --> 39:25.480
Cosimo!

39:28.240 --> 39:29.320
Cosimo!

39:33.320 --> 39:34.560
Cosimo!

39:47.640 --> 39:51.080
-I hope you confessed your sins.
-I'm sorry?

39:56.920 --> 39:59.640
My niece is being forced
against her wishes

39:59.720 --> 40:03.040
to break her engagement.
I know you told your husband.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.120
I trusted you with my feelings

40:07.200 --> 40:10.560
and all the while, you were just feeding
information to Venice.

40:12.560 --> 40:16.800
Admit it.
You told Cosimo about the engagement.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.520
I've been a fool.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.840
What do you think
put your cousin up to such a ploy?

40:37.920 --> 40:40.200
I'm well aware who it was.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.120
-The Albizzi?
-Not this time.

40:42.200 --> 40:46.080
Mario would not collude with them.
No, for my knowledge of my cousin's debts.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.600
I believe it was someone in Venice.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.560
You can't think that someone here
would want you executed as a traitor?

40:53.640 --> 40:55.720
Not when you've done
so much for this city.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.960
True, not executed.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.960
No, I believe they intended
to blackmail me into remaining here.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.760
Who would benefit most
from my indefinite stay here?

41:07.880 --> 41:10.120
If you're right,
and I have my doubts that you are,

41:10.200 --> 41:14.840
whomever it was, perhaps
doubted your allegiance to Venice.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.240
Careful though,

41:16.320 --> 41:20.480
to falsely accuse any member
of the Council is high treason.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.920
I have no intention
of making any accusations.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.080
I've made it clear
that my allegiance never faltered.

41:27.160 --> 41:31.800
All I point out is that...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.960
We have an arrangement.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.280
I've bestowed a number of gifts upon you,
including a new daughter.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.880
So all I ask of you,

41:39.960 --> 41:44.120
is that you ensure word
of this failed plot reaches Florence.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.840
They must have no doubt of my loyalty.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.360
No, no! No!

41:54.440 --> 41:57.640
You little gutter whore.
Don't tell me you didn't know about this.

41:57.720 --> 42:01.960
It's been happening right under
your pretty little nose. Hasn't it?

42:02.040 --> 42:04.680
We should start here. Hmm?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.560
No!

42:14.440 --> 42:16.320
She is not your property.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.160
-She belongs to the Doge!
-I was a gift! He's my master now!

42:20.240 --> 42:23.360
How much?
I'll pay whatever the Doge requires!

42:25.280 --> 42:26.480
How much?

42:30.200 --> 42:33.920
You can keep her. She's not worth it.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.080
It's just a scratch. It will heal.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.200
I'm sorry.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.240
You have nothing to be sorry for.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.280
I knew why you were sent here.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.720
It wasn't your choice.
What else could you do?

43:10.280 --> 43:13.480
How did you know
that I wouldn't betray you?

43:15.200 --> 43:17.080
I didn't.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.840
Medici! Medici! Medici!

44:47.920 --> 44:53.720
Medici! Medici! Medici! Medici! Medici!

45:13.120 --> 45:16.720
- Bring back Medici!
- You're going to ruin the Florence!

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
Bring back Medici!

45:23.000 --> 45:27.320
Those vermin need to be dealt with.
I mean, why do they even gather?

45:27.400 --> 45:29.040
We should turn the guards on them.

45:30.120 --> 45:33.760
Signor Pazzi. There is news from Venice.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.960
Medici has uncovered a Milanese plot.

45:37.040 --> 45:40.760
He acted out of loyalty to Florence.
It's all over the city.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.920
The people are rising up.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.960
We're expecting greater numbers
from the countryside.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.600
The noble families of the Republic
shall join us,

45:54.680 --> 45:57.840
and then we march on the Signoria
and secure our position once and for all.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.600
-Won't we be called traitors?
-We are defenders of the Republic.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.040
We cannot let
the Medici pestilence take hold again.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.760
All those who are loyal to the city
shall join us.

46:22.520 --> 46:25.440
My dear. Your husband finally let you out.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.200
Congratulations on your engagement,
Messer Foscari.

46:29.640 --> 46:34.920
No talk of that tonight. Here.
Now you can be anything you desire.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.440
You can lose yourself to pleasure. Come.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.280
Get... get off me!

46:52.360 --> 46:55.720
Come on. You're not the prim
little Florentine you pretend to be.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.680
You're in Venice now.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.120
Stop it, stop it!

47:00.200 --> 47:01.720
Don't...

47:01.800 --> 47:04.560
Don't tell me you're faithful
to that bore of a husband?

47:04.640 --> 47:07.000
Piero is the best man you'll ever meet.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.560
He's a fool. Pining away for Florence.

47:09.640 --> 47:13.760
You do realize my father has no intention
of ever letting you back there.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.880
Don't be so naïve.

47:18.720 --> 47:23.360
We will return to Florence.
With or without your help.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.680
Enjoy your evening, Messer Foscari.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.240
-What are you doing here?
-I came to find you.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.960
Can't have you going to every party alone.

47:44.080 --> 47:48.040
-You're trembling.
-It's just the heat.

47:48.120 --> 47:51.000
-Will you please take me home?
-Of course.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.160
You were right. We don't belong here.
These aren't our people.

47:57.240 --> 48:00.280
There's no harm
in enjoying different society.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.000
I was wrong to make you feel guilty.
I'm sorry.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.000
You're all the society I require.

48:20.520 --> 48:24.880
Time has come for action.
How many men do you have at your disposal?

48:24.960 --> 48:28.400
Take a seat, my friend. Have some wine.

48:33.440 --> 48:34.600
As you choose.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.360
There are crowds of Medici supporters
gathering outside.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.600
We must act now,
or he will use this opportunity to return.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.720
The others may not see it, but I do!

48:42.800 --> 48:45.280
-And they must be made to!
-Rinaldo.

48:46.920 --> 48:49.480
I beg you. Stop.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.400
I've told the men I have here
to be ready for my signal.

48:51.480 --> 48:55.000
Fewer than I'd hoped, but reinforcements
are coming from the countryside.

48:55.080 --> 48:57.520
You and I must be prepared
to take the Signoria by force!

49:02.560 --> 49:06.720
This is no time for cowardice, Pazzi.
Don't you see?

49:06.800 --> 49:09.040
While we have the power to act, we must.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.800
You have no power, my friend.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.160
Out of your own mouth,

49:29.720 --> 49:32.920
you have condemned yourself.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.680
I am a loyal citizen of the Republic.

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
Stop them!

49:54.920 --> 49:58.200
It is you who are traitors!

50:18.640 --> 50:19.880
Ezio?

50:21.760 --> 50:24.360
-What are you doing here?
-I heard you were leaving.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.720
That's right. There's nothing for me here.

50:26.800 --> 50:30.320
It looks like fortune
favors your husband again.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.240
From what I hear, he will return.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.960
It looks that way.

50:37.520 --> 50:39.320
I owe you an apology.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.080
There's no need for that.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.800
Your loyalty, as ever, does you credit.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.880
I hope he learns to honor you
as you deserve.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.760
Come with me.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.400
I know I can make you happy.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.120
I can't leave.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.600
There are greater causes
than our happiness.

51:37.880 --> 51:41.600
Medici! Medici! Medici!
