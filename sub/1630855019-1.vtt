WEBVTT

00:26.159 --> 00:32.632
A long time ago...

00:45.278 --> 00:49.282
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:04.964 --> 01:06.199
Hyah! Hyah!

01:14.607 --> 01:16.142
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:57.149 --> 02:02.488
<i> Egypt. A land of mystery,
intrigue and rich history.</i>

02:02.554 --> 02:06.359
<i> Today I, the world-renowned
archeologist,</i>

02:06.425 --> 02:08.427
<i> Lord Sylvester Carnaby,</i>

02:08.494 --> 02:10.563
<i> present to you...</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:11.664
<i> Hold on.</i>

02:11.731 --> 02:13.432
-Mummy, I'm--
-<i> Sylvester!</i>

02:13.499 --> 02:14.734
-I can't talk.
-<i> Where have you been?</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:16.569
<i> I haven't heard
a peep from you.</i>

02:16.635 --> 02:19.005
Listen, I can't talk right now,
I have a date with--

02:19.071 --> 02:20.373
<i> A date? Oh, my God.</i>

02:20.439 --> 02:21.974
-No, a date with history!
-<i> At last!</i>

02:22.040 --> 02:24.110
<i> I bet she's pretty.</i>

02:24.177 --> 02:25.278
Oh, I'm losing you--

02:25.344 --> 02:30.783
Oh, terrible signal...

02:30.850 --> 02:32.852
<i> On the other side
of this door,</i>

02:32.919 --> 02:36.556
<i> lies the tomb
of Princess Nefer.</i>

03:07.053 --> 03:08.955
No, it can't be.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.356
Wow!

03:10.422 --> 03:12.258
"Wow"?

03:12.325 --> 03:14.360
It's empty!

03:14.426 --> 03:16.162
The Mummy isn't here.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.396
-Let me see!
-No!

03:17.463 --> 03:18.630
-Get back.
-I got next!

03:18.697 --> 03:21.634
-You're always like this.
-No, you!

03:21.701 --> 03:23.002
You and your grasping arms...

03:23.069 --> 03:25.137
-What's this? Look.
-Stop it!

03:25.204 --> 03:26.238
-Look at this.
-Ha-hah!

03:26.305 --> 03:27.540
Oh! Lord Carnaby.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.976
It seems to speak of...

03:30.043 --> 03:33.512
-Hello?
-A bridge...

03:33.579 --> 03:38.117
From the world of the living
to the afterlife.

03:38.184 --> 03:41.354
A doorway of sorts to...
a city!

03:41.420 --> 03:44.156
A city where the mummies reside
in the afterlife.

03:44.223 --> 03:48.394
A world of mummies...
under the earth.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.064
What...

03:52.131 --> 03:53.967
You two. Get the equipment.

03:56.268 --> 03:58.905
Oh!

04:01.073 --> 04:02.675
I've found something!

04:03.676 --> 04:04.944
Huh?

05:00.032 --> 05:02.035
MUMMIES

05:21.253 --> 05:22.588
THUT SIGNING SESSION

05:27.660 --> 05:31.263
With love...
Thut the Charioteer.

05:34.734 --> 05:35.835
Can I?

05:41.774 --> 05:44.910
Why did you stop racing?
You're so young.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.813
Oh, you know, I just want
to give others a chance to win.

05:48.948 --> 05:50.849
Why haven't you found
that special girl

05:50.916 --> 05:53.185
to settle down with? Hmm?

05:53.252 --> 05:57.490
Well, marriage is forever
and us mummies live forever,

05:57.556 --> 06:00.193
so I think... not for me.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.662
-You rock!
-Whoo-hoo!

06:03.729 --> 06:06.065
-Hey, Thut!
-We love you, Thut!

06:16.842 --> 06:18.644
What you doing, little brother?

06:21.147 --> 06:23.616
Thut's big return!

06:23.682 --> 06:26.919
You saw all the fans you
still have at the papyrus shop.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.496
No! I can't.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.797
Yes, you can. You're the champ!

06:38.864 --> 06:41.801
I was the champ. Not anymore.

06:42.501 --> 06:45.904
I can't go back.

06:45.971 --> 06:48.775
Just go home, Sekhem.
I'll get us some food.

06:53.812 --> 06:57.683
Oh! There you go, my friend.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.685
-See you next week.
-Yeah, see you next week.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.055
Huh?

07:07.726 --> 07:09.895
-Stop, madam!
-Oh!

07:09.962 --> 07:11.130
Oh!

07:14.699 --> 07:17.537
Oh, you're very kind.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.240
My basket!

07:21.306 --> 07:22.575
No worries! I got it.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.886
Don't you know to look first,
before crossing the street?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.587
Don't you see people crossing?

07:35.654 --> 07:36.989
You had to stop! I was first.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.560
I was the one crossing first!
You had to stop.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.596
Next time, look first!

07:45.331 --> 07:49.935
Hyah!

07:50.002 --> 07:51.471
Mm?

07:57.142 --> 07:59.478
Here we are.
Don't forget your basket.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.548
Oh, thank you very much.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.945

09:41.847 --> 09:44.283
Oh, Ra be merciful!

09:44.349 --> 09:47.820
Usi, this place hasn't changed
in thousands of years.

09:47.886 --> 09:49.521
We need change.

09:49.588 --> 09:53.425
What would your father
say if he hears you singing?

09:53.491 --> 09:54.760
You will soon be named

09:54.827 --> 09:56.695
the official successor
of the Pharaoh.

09:56.761 --> 10:00.632
Singing is for entertainers,
not for the rulers
of our world.

10:00.699 --> 10:03.803
-Shh! You can't tell him!
-Mm...

10:04.736 --> 10:06.472
All right.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.075
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

10:10.142 --> 10:13.411
Suspicious of what?

10:13.478 --> 10:15.814
Dad! Of, um... Well, uh...

10:15.881 --> 10:18.650
Her new suitor.

10:18.717 --> 10:20.385
My... new suitor?

10:20.452 --> 10:21.721
Mm. Did you forget?

10:23.255 --> 10:24.756
Um...

10:24.823 --> 10:27.526
Today, my daughter,
the Phoenix Bird,

10:27.593 --> 10:29.962
guided by Hathor,
the Goddess of Love,

10:30.029 --> 10:32.398
will choose
your future husband.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.270
That was not in my schedule.
Where is my schedule, please?

10:38.336 --> 10:41.574
Dad! Sorry, sorry, I mean,
Great Pharaoh.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.943
I need at least
a hundred more years

10:44.009 --> 10:45.510
before I get engaged!

10:45.577 --> 10:47.746
What if--
What if I don't like him?

10:47.813 --> 10:55.788
What if we don't get along?
What if--

10:55.855 --> 10:59.658
You know what?
I don't want to get married!

11:02.861 --> 11:06.231
It isn't just any bird!
It's a Phoenix Bird.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.934
Sent by the Goddess
of Love herself!

11:09.000 --> 11:11.137
Dad, come on.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.739
The two thousands
are the new one thousands.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.307
So, I'm still pretty young.

11:15.374 --> 11:18.177
I have other priorities
in my life.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.177
Priorities?

11:19.244 --> 11:21.880
Being a princess,
that is your duty!

11:21.947 --> 11:23.816
And that includes marriage.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.520
I know you are nervous,
but you will see,

11:28.587 --> 11:32.825
the Goddess has
someone handsome
and exciting in mind for you.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.569
The Goddess Hathor

11:44.636 --> 11:49.041
shall guide
the majestic Phoenix
through our kingdom.

11:49.108 --> 11:54.180
Let us open the Stargate
for the Phoenix!

12:21.940 --> 12:24.109
Aww!

12:24.176 --> 12:25.577
Oh! Uh...

12:25.644 --> 12:27.646
Sorry. Wrong recipe.

12:40.825 --> 12:42.861
Now, glorious Phoenix!

12:42.928 --> 12:45.097
Take flight!

12:46.664 --> 12:49.101
We await your destiny.

13:02.514 --> 13:04.216
-Watch out!
-Hey!

13:11.490 --> 13:14.793
The Great Sekhem,
the undefeated boomer...

13:14.860 --> 13:16.194
Uh...

13:16.261 --> 13:19.731
Boomerang, uh...
boomerang guy!

13:19.798 --> 13:23.669
Mm...

13:27.072 --> 13:29.241
Huh?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.943
Oh, false alarm.

13:38.917 --> 13:41.020
Oh, no.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.257
-The Phoenix bird has chosen!
-Are you sure?

13:46.324 --> 13:50.062
It swooped down
towards a house.

13:54.399 --> 13:55.901
Ow!

13:59.538 --> 14:00.539
Huh!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.142
Hmm...

14:05.644 --> 14:08.547
Sorry, signing was
from five to seven.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.887
Do you... Do you know who I am?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.923
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to myself here?

14:17.990 --> 14:20.726
Could you please put me down?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.528
What is it the--

14:23.595 --> 14:26.031
but could somebody
please tell me--

14:28.367 --> 14:29.535
Rise, young man.

14:30.469 --> 14:34.606
I know you.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.841
Ex-charioteer, Your Majesty.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.277
An ex-charioteer?

14:38.344 --> 14:40.279
I have to marry a guy
whose only talent

14:40.346 --> 14:43.482
is riding around in a circle?

14:43.549 --> 14:48.787
Young Thut.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.692
Thanks. Cheers. Thank you.

14:53.759 --> 14:58.230
In seven days, you shall
wed the Princess Nefer!

14:59.498 --> 15:02.868
Wed?
Hold on. As in marry?

15:02.934 --> 15:04.536
We've never even met.

15:06.004 --> 15:07.940
The crazy driver!

15:08.007 --> 15:10.909
Sorry. This is crazy.
Marry the princess?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.177
This is a lot.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.778
I mean, so many things
to consider.

15:13.845 --> 15:15.079
Like, are we compatible?

15:15.146 --> 15:16.815
And that I'm allergic
to marriage.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.585
Diagnosed, in fact.
Ah-choo! Ah-choo!

15:19.652 --> 15:21.119
He's right, Dad, he's right!

15:21.186 --> 15:24.289
Sorry, I mean, um,
Great Pharaoh.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.825
If you go against
the Goddess' wishes,

15:26.892 --> 15:29.628
they will cut out your tongue
and pluck out your eyes.

15:29.694 --> 15:33.565
Both eyes?

15:34.900 --> 15:37.435
Oh, who doesn't love marriage?

15:37.502 --> 15:39.204
Nefer, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!

15:39.271 --> 15:41.607
Where were we
honeymooning again?

15:41.673 --> 15:44.309
Could you do the pluck out
of the eyes to me

15:44.375 --> 15:46.745
so that I don't
have to see this?

15:49.014 --> 15:50.582
Enough!

15:52.084 --> 15:54.720
It is now your duty
to safeguard this ring

15:54.787 --> 15:58.357
until the day of the wedding.
If anything happens to it...

16:00.258 --> 16:03.128
Eyes and tongue
punishment thing.

16:03.195 --> 16:06.865
Destiny has been written.

16:06.932 --> 16:09.067
Let us leave
the bride and groom

16:09.134 --> 16:11.236
to get to know each other.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.083
What did you say
your name was?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.419
Uh, Thut the Charioteer.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.721
Whatever. Let's just get
something straight, okay?

16:29.788 --> 16:31.856
Don't go getting
emotionally involved because--

16:31.923 --> 16:35.861
Hey, stop, Princess.
Honestly, you're not my type.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.595
Oh, what a relief.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.097
Because I wouldn't
go out with you

16:39.164 --> 16:41.400
if you were the last mummy
on earth.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.701
So thanks for saving me
the trouble.

16:45.670 --> 16:49.408
Well, you make an eternity
feel like... uh, an eternity.

16:49.474 --> 16:51.342
Why am I even wasting my time
talking to you?

16:51.409 --> 16:53.645
The woman who needs
a deranged pigeon

16:53.711 --> 16:55.080
to find her a husband.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.383
Oh, it is not a pigeon.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.886
It's a Phoenix bird!

17:00.953 --> 17:03.756
Sent by the Goddess
of Love herself!

17:05.657 --> 17:07.626
Oh. You... you smile.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.297
there has been some kind
of mistake. Oh!

17:12.364 --> 17:16.568
Mm.

17:16.635 --> 17:17.969
He... can be.

17:18.036 --> 17:20.005
Look, why don't you
just back out?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.373
They'd only scoop out your eyes
and cut out your tongue,

17:22.440 --> 17:24.776
and then you'd talk less!
So, win-win.

17:24.842 --> 17:26.645
Ah, this is getting dark.

17:31.249 --> 17:34.218
Oh, you're right! Usi!

17:35.988 --> 17:38.356
Y-yes?

17:38.423 --> 17:40.959
Operator, it should be
night time.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.560
Eh?

17:42.627 --> 17:44.396
Quickly, quickly!

17:45.597 --> 17:47.199
Night!

18:30.742 --> 18:31.877
Shooting star, please.

18:37.248 --> 18:39.250
I think I could
get used to this.

18:39.317 --> 18:41.487
Well, you won't have to. So...

18:43.588 --> 18:46.625
Thanks for coming by, though.
A shame you have to go.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.828
So, I'll...
see you at the wedding?

18:50.895 --> 18:53.297
Oh, I can't wait.

18:53.364 --> 18:54.700
Uh, well, neither can I.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.903
Oh, yeah? Well, I really
can't wait to marry you.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.539
I'm just so excited
to marry a charioteer!

19:01.606 --> 19:03.975
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can't wait
to marry you

19:04.042 --> 19:07.679
and love you forever
and cherish you
for all eternity!

19:07.746 --> 19:09.080
-Fine!
-Fine!

19:12.117 --> 19:14.753
The shooting star
was a bit much,
don't you think?

19:15.820 --> 19:17.989
Oh, he seemed nice.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.825
Nice? Please...

19:20.892 --> 19:22.227
Mm.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.841
Well? What did they want?

19:35.907 --> 19:38.310
I was afraid
they were going
to execute you.

19:38.376 --> 19:41.079
No. It's worse than that.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.147
They want me to get married.

19:43.214 --> 19:44.883
Married? You?

19:50.121 --> 19:53.191
I would lose
all my freedom.
I'm pro-single!

19:53.258 --> 19:56.460
How can I be pro-single
and married at the same time?

19:56.527 --> 19:58.830
It's impossible!

19:58.897 --> 20:01.366
Listen, brother.
Let's keep
the Thut myth alive.

20:04.235 --> 20:06.104
Not even the princess.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.141
Wait.
Did you say "the princess"?

20:09.207 --> 20:10.575
That's awesome!

20:10.642 --> 20:13.244
We're gonna be rich!
Like, forever!

20:13.311 --> 20:17.816
And live in the palace!

20:17.882 --> 20:20.318
Princess or not,
I don't want to get married.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.921
No matter how many people
might clean for me.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.690
Whoa, is that the wedding ring?
It's huge!

20:25.757 --> 20:27.993
-Here, let me have it.
-No.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.399
-It's heavy!
-Yeah, like a ball and chain.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.601
Sekhem, do you take
this Croc

20:36.668 --> 20:39.438
to be your
lawfully wedded crocodile?

20:39.504 --> 20:42.574
Would you give that back?
My life depends on this ring.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.476
I'm not even gonna keep it
at home.

20:44.542 --> 20:47.746
This ring is going where
nobody else can get to it.

20:59.457 --> 21:01.726
Wow! Your trophies!

21:01.793 --> 21:04.162
Don't touch anything.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.397
Understood?

21:11.035 --> 21:12.371
It will be safe here.

21:13.971 --> 21:15.574
Okay, let's go.

21:35.393 --> 21:38.296
Would you look at that?

21:38.362 --> 21:41.366
It is full
of wonderful things!

21:41.432 --> 21:44.602
-Um, is it my turn now?
-No, I go next.

21:44.669 --> 21:46.438
-No, 'cause it's mine.
-You're always like this.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.973
-I... go... next!
-Stop it!

21:48.040 --> 21:49.574
This is serious archaeology.

21:52.543 --> 21:54.779
Mother!
You'll never guess what...

21:57.115 --> 21:58.383
Ow!

22:04.389 --> 22:05.991
You!

22:11.496 --> 22:13.598
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

22:13.665 --> 22:14.866
Huh?

22:19.137 --> 22:20.639
and not touch anything.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.574
I gave you one job!

22:27.713 --> 22:29.781
You great big nincom--

22:29.848 --> 22:31.950
-Wait. What's that?
-Huh?

22:32.016 --> 22:33.585
Oh, go on then.

22:35.553 --> 22:39.725
Oh! A royal wedding ring.

22:49.133 --> 22:50.635
Oh, yes!

22:52.536 --> 22:54.438
What the--

22:54.505 --> 22:58.009
Mm!

23:01.879 --> 23:02.781
Aah!

23:06.084 --> 23:07.251
The charioteer?

23:07.318 --> 23:09.755
No, no. What happened?

23:13.491 --> 23:16.995
The ring. Where's the ring?
It's gone!

23:18.329 --> 23:19.697
It's disappeared!

23:19.764 --> 23:21.099
Gah!

23:23.535 --> 23:27.572
By the God Ra, this could
only be the work of...

23:27.639 --> 23:30.041
Livings!

23:34.045 --> 23:37.949
This will be the jewel
of my new exhibition.

23:39.717 --> 23:43.555
Call the royal guard!

23:43.622 --> 23:45.656
It's just a ring.
Buy another one.

23:45.723 --> 23:48.126
It's the ring.
Don't you get it?

23:48.192 --> 23:50.261
If I don't find it
they'll cut out my tongue

23:50.327 --> 23:52.664
and scoop out my eyes.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.732
The only way to get it back
is to go to...

23:54.799 --> 23:56.401
the world of the living.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.170
Really? Great!
What an adventure!

23:59.237 --> 24:01.539
Adventure? It's dangerous!

24:01.606 --> 24:04.609
Ahem! You're not alone.
You have a team.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.277
There is no way
you are coming.

24:06.344 --> 24:10.982
They are mummy robbers.

24:11.049 --> 24:16.321
Listen, brother.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.224
May the Gods protect us.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.067
Sekhem!

25:03.134 --> 25:06.037
It would reveal
our true nature
to the living.

25:30.662 --> 25:31.963
-Look out!
-Whoa!

25:32.763 --> 25:34.632
What was that?

25:34.699 --> 25:37.535
A giant chariot.
But where are the horses?

25:37.602 --> 25:38.803
Thut!

25:46.544 --> 25:48.346
There! They've got the ring!

25:48.413 --> 25:52.483
-Whoa!
-Nice one, Lord--

25:55.653 --> 25:58.623
The ring! This will be easier
than I thought. Wait here.

26:04.495 --> 26:06.864
Right now,
get that thing over there,

26:06.931 --> 26:08.667
and shove it over there.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.270
Right,
there's no space over there.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.044
Sekhem!
What are you doing here?

26:19.110 --> 26:21.012
Look! The ring is
in that other steel beast!

26:21.079 --> 26:22.947
What do you mean?
Which other one?

26:23.014 --> 26:25.650
Quickly!
The beasts are migrating!

26:31.089 --> 26:35.126
Thut, come on!
Thut! Pull yourself up!

26:37.528 --> 26:40.298
-What's
happened to you?
-Uh, this is going too fast.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.935
No. Focus on your mission.

26:44.001 --> 26:46.637
That's it,
thinking about the ring.

26:46.704 --> 26:51.075
Should be nice and easy.

26:51.142 --> 26:54.312
Hmm... This could
take a while.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.485
Nothing.
It must be in
one of the other--

27:04.589 --> 27:06.891
Someone's coming!
Quick, hide!

27:15.633 --> 27:17.836
CARNABY CORP

27:20.338 --> 27:22.707
THIS SIDE UP

27:25.276 --> 27:27.779
WARNING - THIS DOOR IS
BLOCKED FROM THE INSIDE

27:32.483 --> 27:34.319
-Go!
-Where are we?

27:34.385 --> 27:36.353
Don't worry. Everything is
gonna be all right.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.590
The sooner we find the ring,
the sooner we're home.

27:38.656 --> 27:39.991
Quickly! No time to lose.

27:40.058 --> 27:44.229
Shh! We're not alone.

27:57.909 --> 27:59.577
Oh, what? You?

27:59.643 --> 28:01.579
Ha-ha!

28:01.646 --> 28:04.115
Whoa! Uh-oh!

28:05.483 --> 28:07.351
-Princess!
-Help.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.091
Huh?

28:14.158 --> 28:16.261
Oh. Princess Nefer's here.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.263
Wait a minute!
Princess Nefer?
Why are you here?

28:18.329 --> 28:21.332
Uh, the question...
is why are you here?

28:21.399 --> 28:24.902
Running away?

28:24.969 --> 28:28.105
Thut runs from nobody!
He's the bravest.

28:28.172 --> 28:30.375
Although, he did
lose the ring.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.876
-Sekhem!
-Lost the ring?

28:31.942 --> 28:33.811
No, but that's great!

28:33.878 --> 28:37.882
Then we don't have to
get married!

28:37.948 --> 28:40.417
-They're gonna take my eyes!
-But think:

28:40.484 --> 28:43.921
Eyes... eternal marriage.
Eyes... eternal marriage.

28:43.988 --> 28:45.189
Come on!
They're not that nice.

28:45.256 --> 28:46.858
You still got
four other senses.

28:46.924 --> 28:48.893
They take my tongue, too.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.795
Then you still have
three other senses.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.730
Enough.
I don't wanna talk about it.

28:52.796 --> 28:54.565
Let's get out of here.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.604
Mm-mm.
It's locked from the outside.

28:59.670 --> 29:01.205
We are stuck in here.

29:01.272 --> 29:04.509
Oh, yeah?
That's what you think.
Watch and learn.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.049
And I pass
into the afterlife!

29:12.116 --> 29:14.752
-I win!
-Congrats, you beat a kid.

29:14.818 --> 29:16.353
Nah, nah, nah-nah, nah!

29:20.758 --> 29:22.259
Should I tell him?
Or you?

29:22.326 --> 29:24.695
-You! You're his brother.
-You're the princess.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.364
-So?
-And his fiancee.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.465
Oh, come on,
that doesn't count!

29:28.532 --> 29:29.834
Um, I'm not--

29:29.901 --> 29:31.903
Agh! Hey!

29:34.472 --> 29:37.709
Oh, sweet Mother of Horus.
That's the sea!

29:37.775 --> 29:39.410
Oh,
well done, genius.

29:39.477 --> 29:41.245
Well, excuse me, Princess.

29:41.311 --> 29:43.081
Maybe we wouldn't be here
if you hadn't hit me with a--

29:43.147 --> 29:44.449
Oh, come on,
would you relax?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.417
If we escape now,
we'll be lost at sea.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.254
We have to wait
until we get to land.

30:00.464 --> 30:02.667
Croc. Shut up.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.068
Croc!

30:10.407 --> 30:11.475
Gah!

30:14.077 --> 30:15.946
A princess who snores?

30:16.013 --> 30:17.982
And I bet she farts.

30:46.343 --> 30:49.047
That's it. Lower, lower.

30:55.252 --> 30:57.956
Come on! Let's go.
We have to find the ring.

31:05.062 --> 31:06.631
Uh!

31:12.636 --> 31:14.672
Whoa-ho-ho!

31:14.738 --> 31:16.107
-Ha-ha!
-Sekhem!

31:18.542 --> 31:21.712
Oh, my Osiris.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.281
What place is this?

31:23.348 --> 31:26.183
Amun, I've never seen
anything like it.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.186
-Babylon!
-No, this is way bigger.

31:29.253 --> 31:31.789
There's only one power
that could surpass Egypt.

31:31.855 --> 31:33.791
The Roman Empire!

31:33.857 --> 31:37.594
Exactly. Guys,
we are in Rome.

31:38.962 --> 31:39.998
TRADITIONAL
FISH & CHIPS

31:42.233 --> 31:45.637
Hey, look at that!

31:45.703 --> 31:47.204
-Give it here. Give it!
-No, I go next!

31:47.271 --> 31:51.208
-You shut your cake hole!
-Careful!

31:51.275 --> 31:54.111
Be quiet!
Just put it down. Now.

31:55.879 --> 31:57.014
You stupid...

32:00.551 --> 32:03.287
Mother!

32:03.354 --> 32:05.222
Of course, Mother,
how could I forget?

32:05.289 --> 32:07.225
Why didn't you idiots
remind me

32:07.292 --> 32:09.560
I had tickets
to the theater today?

32:09.626 --> 32:11.462
I'm on my way, Mummy.

32:12.196 --> 32:13.598
To the theater.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.981
Quick! Hide!

32:33.784 --> 32:35.619
Uh...

32:35.686 --> 32:37.188
Huh?

32:38.422 --> 32:40.191
Yeah.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.360
Oh, I love Romans!

32:56.707 --> 32:58.375
What are those
light rays?

32:58.442 --> 33:01.980
They're stealing our souls!

33:17.728 --> 33:19.130
Me, too.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.932
Ahem!

33:21.999 --> 33:25.203
Ah! The Gods
are protecting us!
We're saved!

33:25.269 --> 33:27.505
Look! They left
their weapons!

33:27.571 --> 33:30.141
Come on.
Nothing can stop us.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.578
Hm!

33:34.345 --> 33:36.313
Sylvester! You're late.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.250
But I don't mind
because you'll always be
my little one!

33:39.317 --> 33:40.685
Oh, Mummy, please.

33:42.586 --> 33:45.923
Not in public.
No. Mummy don't, please.

33:45.990 --> 33:51.729
There. That's better.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.466
Hey, what are you
doing here?

33:55.533 --> 33:58.536
Ha-hah!
Step back, Roman!

33:59.703 --> 34:02.473
Uh... Wha...
These weapons are useless!

34:02.540 --> 34:04.608
Okay, okay.
Your Instagram stuff
is done.

34:04.675 --> 34:06.476
The front door is
for the audience, honey.

34:06.543 --> 34:08.179
Come on, here we go.
Stage door.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.780
-Spit spot!
-Excuse me. Hey!

34:09.847 --> 34:11.649
AIDA
A NEW MUSICAL

34:13.150 --> 34:14.818
-What?
-Oh!

34:14.885 --> 34:17.021
Whoa!

34:17.088 --> 34:19.356
This is a strange
Egyptian colony.

34:19.423 --> 34:21.358
Stay with me.
I'll protect you.

34:21.425 --> 34:23.494
Hey, dears, hurry up!

34:23.561 --> 34:26.096
No! Wait. We're looking
for Hathor's ring!

34:26.163 --> 34:28.199
I demand that you tell me
where it is!

34:28.266 --> 34:31.134
You're in character.
I like it.

34:31.201 --> 34:33.404
Approved. Now go
and wait for your cue!

34:33.470 --> 34:36.074
Oh! Uh... Hey.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.644
-That one is such a diva.
-Oh, yes.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.013
Um, does this colony
have a Pharaoh?

34:43.080 --> 34:45.049
You're talking to him, honey.

34:45.115 --> 34:46.818

36:42.333 --> 36:43.834
But she's not
in the program at all.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.303
What a bungle.
Do you know her, Sylvester?

36:46.370 --> 36:47.805
-Oh! Wake up!
-Huh?

36:47.872 --> 36:51.342
What are you doing?
Asleep all the way through!

36:51.408 --> 36:52.476

38:09.686 --> 38:13.557
That is the best staging
I have ever seen!

38:13.624 --> 38:15.893
This isn't staged.

38:26.069 --> 38:28.305
Aw, you like her.

38:28.372 --> 38:32.242
I don't like her.

38:34.110 --> 38:36.847
Did you see?
They gave me
a standing ovation!

38:36.914 --> 38:39.249
Super! You got an ovation.
I got the ring.

38:39.316 --> 38:41.852
Now, back to the After World.

38:41.919 --> 38:44.689
Oh! Oh, look!
We can use
a human chariot.

38:45.122 --> 38:50.460
Hmm.

38:50.527 --> 38:51.895
Why isn't it moving?

38:51.962 --> 38:53.430
Huh?

38:53.497 --> 38:55.800
Look! The chariot's tied up!

38:55.866 --> 38:58.135
Hey, guys!

38:58.202 --> 39:01.572
Hi! I was looking for you.
I need to talk to her.
She's--

39:01.638 --> 39:05.275
Thanks, but no thanks.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.911
I heard you sing in there--

39:07.978 --> 39:10.347
And how many does this have?

39:10.414 --> 39:13.516
I don't really
do cars, but--

39:13.583 --> 39:15.452
We have to run!
He wants the ring!

39:15.519 --> 39:17.788
I'm here to help.
Get in!

39:22.126 --> 39:24.461
What?

39:26.697 --> 39:28.265
<i> Sylvester!</i>

39:28.332 --> 39:31.802
Yes, Mother?

39:31.869 --> 39:34.671
Please, excuse Thut.
He's just very, well...

39:34.738 --> 39:38.775
Who are you?

39:38.842 --> 39:41.712
I heard you sing in there
and I absolutely
loved your voice.

39:41.778 --> 39:43.614
Uh, well,
the joke's on you, pal,

39:43.681 --> 39:44.882
because I didn't even sing,

39:44.949 --> 39:47.083
so, I don't know
what you were watching.

39:47.150 --> 39:49.053
Not you, mate. Her.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.754
Me? Yeah?

39:50.821 --> 39:53.490
So I've got a song
I've wrote

39:53.557 --> 39:54.592
Would you like
to sing it for me?

39:54.658 --> 39:58.128
-Uh... Wow. I...
-Thanks, Ed.

39:58.195 --> 40:01.999
She would love to,

40:02.066 --> 40:03.868
Could you stop? Please?

40:11.374 --> 40:12.676
Hey, hey, think about it,

40:12.743 --> 40:14.444
and get me through Insta
or Facebook.

40:14.511 --> 40:16.513
-Uh, where?
-Thanks! Bye!

40:16.580 --> 40:19.183
Now, can we please focus
on returning home?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.521
Uh...

40:23.587 --> 40:26.657
I'm sorry about him.
Thank you for saving us.

40:26.723 --> 40:29.159
Hey, if you need me,
you'll find me here.

40:29.226 --> 40:30.994
Sure. Will do.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.096
Ha!

40:44.708 --> 40:46.176
Why don't you
give me a choice?

40:46.243 --> 40:48.578
He has seen something
special in me, Thut.

40:48.645 --> 40:50.648
A choice?
None of us have a choice.

40:50.714 --> 40:53.850
We belong in the After World.
You are the Princess.

40:53.917 --> 40:55.786
I have been dreaming
all my life

40:55.852 --> 40:58.021
about what I want to do,
and that is singing.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.790
I don't know
if I want to go back

40:59.857 --> 41:01.959
and spend an eternity
bound to a...

41:02.793 --> 41:05.863
To have my dreams dismissed.

41:12.570 --> 41:16.006
-Um... technically, he didn't.
-What?

41:16.073 --> 41:20.544
What do you mean,
"technically"?

41:20.611 --> 41:24.648
It's not like he saw you
and chose you
or anything. Sorry...

41:24.715 --> 41:26.950
Sekhem! You...

41:27.017 --> 41:29.253
Beautiful boy!

41:29.319 --> 41:30.587
Do you know
what this means?

41:30.654 --> 41:32.323
I get to remain single!

41:32.389 --> 41:36.359
And I don't have to
marry you!

41:36.426 --> 41:37.327
Me, too!

41:40.531 --> 41:41.899
Ugh!

41:44.201 --> 41:46.136
Okay, let's find a boat
to go home.

41:46.203 --> 41:48.238
We're running out of time.

41:48.305 --> 41:51.075
Wow! It's a magic Stargate.

41:51.141 --> 41:52.642
Maybe we can enter there.

41:52.709 --> 41:55.012
And then home.
Sekhem, you're a genius.

41:55.078 --> 41:56.079
I love it.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.948
Oh, by the way.
This is for you.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.115
Uh, hey, guys?

41:59.182 --> 42:01.051
-This isn't the ring.
-Isn't the ring?

42:01.117 --> 42:03.887
What do you mean
it isn't the ring?

42:03.954 --> 42:06.757
Oh, my tongue and eyes
are still on the line here.

42:06.824 --> 42:09.793
Look, I may not want
to spend eternity with you,

42:09.860 --> 42:12.897
but even an ex-charioteer
doesn't deserve that.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.365
Thank you, Princess.
That's very kind of you.

42:15.432 --> 42:17.868
But we have to start again,
and time is running out.

42:17.934 --> 42:21.171
We can't do anything now.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.473
Ed's a nice guy.
He offered
to take us home.

42:23.540 --> 42:27.311
Ed?

42:27.377 --> 42:28.478
I'd rather sleep here.

42:30.346 --> 42:33.250
Uh, hair? Wet? No way.

42:39.656 --> 42:44.394
-Hey!
-Hi, Ed.

42:44.461 --> 42:47.197
Uh, sure!
Yeah. Come on in.

42:47.264 --> 42:48.665
-Thank you.
-Ooh!

42:48.732 --> 42:50.634
Oh, nice... dog.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.236
Ah!

42:57.374 --> 42:59.509
-Hey, hey...
-Whoa!

43:07.484 --> 43:11.254
So, would you sing
the song for me?

43:11.321 --> 43:13.791
-Uh, yes.
-Yes!

43:13.857 --> 43:16.126
You won't be sorry.
It's gonna be a hit!

43:16.193 --> 43:20.097
Ooh, hear that?
It's gonna be a hit.

43:20.831 --> 43:21.999
Ed, what's a hit?

43:24.767 --> 43:27.671
Yes! Funny and beautiful.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.340
Let's go to the studio.

43:34.444 --> 43:36.546
Ooh! You look great, bro.

43:36.613 --> 43:38.816
Whoo!

44:03.073 --> 44:06.176
Yeah.

44:06.242 --> 44:09.846
Don't get me wrong,
she has some
positive qualities.

44:09.913 --> 44:14.084
She's determined,
strong, intelligent.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.919
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

44:17.053 --> 44:20.124
But, you know. She snores.

44:26.896 --> 44:28.698
Uh, what's going on?

44:28.765 --> 44:30.934
The singer
that ruined the play.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.936
She was wearing a symbol.

44:33.003 --> 44:36.039
-The same symbol
that is in the ring.
-So?

44:36.106 --> 44:39.243
So the legend
behind the ring is true.

44:41.912 --> 44:43.113
Oh!

44:43.180 --> 44:45.615
She has come back
to get her ring.

44:45.682 --> 44:47.451
And I have it.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.757
What could be a more
amazing discovery

44:53.823 --> 44:57.294
than an undiscovered
royal Egyptian ring?

44:57.361 --> 45:00.697
Uh, two undiscovered
royal Egyptian rings!

45:00.764 --> 45:02.799
Two? There are two? Amazing.

45:02.865 --> 45:03.967
No, you morons!

45:04.033 --> 45:06.002
I'm talking about
a living mummy!

45:06.069 --> 45:07.670

45:09.406 --> 45:10.908

45:11.808 --> 45:13.376

45:13.443 --> 45:14.844
Mummy? I can't talk now.

45:14.911 --> 45:17.380
<i> What? Don't you want to talk
to your mother?</i>

45:17.447 --> 45:20.083
Oh, no, no.
No, Mummy, it's not that.

45:20.150 --> 45:22.619
We don't need the phone
because...

45:22.685 --> 45:24.354
I'm right beside you!

45:29.092 --> 45:30.327
I have made
the most important

45:30.394 --> 45:32.462
archaeological discovery
of all time.

45:32.529 --> 45:33.963
-Mm...
-I guarantee you,

45:34.030 --> 45:37.100
the whole world
will now know the name

45:37.167 --> 45:39.903

dog and... you, too.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.387
Listen, big day ahead of us.

45:57.454 --> 46:02.459
I want to stream a video
of Nefer's performance.

46:02.526 --> 46:05.395
Thoughts,
feelings and thoughts.
What say you guys?

46:05.462 --> 46:09.499
Oh, yeah, great.
But we have things to do.

46:09.566 --> 46:13.369
-Oh, come on.
-Cool.

46:13.436 --> 46:17.307
Uh, well, we, uh...
lost our baggage.

46:17.373 --> 46:19.709
Jeez, that happens to me
all the time when I fly.

46:19.776 --> 46:23.580
You fly?

46:23.646 --> 46:25.114
'Cause vintage is out,

46:25.181 --> 46:28.185
and my star needs a new look.

46:29.419 --> 46:32.021
Don't worry.
That means he likes you.

46:32.088 --> 46:34.458
I don't know what's worse.
Freaky dog.

46:34.525 --> 46:36.460
You need to feed that thing.

46:37.227 --> 46:38.528
PARROTS

46:38.595 --> 46:40.831
Whoa! Look!

46:41.531 --> 46:43.533
PARROTS

46:43.600 --> 46:46.102
Okay. Follow me!

46:46.169 --> 46:47.303
-Thut!
-Thut!

46:47.370 --> 46:48.872
-Look out, Thut! Over there!
-Mm?

46:48.939 --> 46:50.841
-Look out!
-Thut!

46:53.710 --> 46:55.579
Whoa! Whoa!

47:02.519 --> 47:04.788
There! I don't think
anybody noticed us, do you?

47:04.855 --> 47:06.423
Uh...

47:06.489 --> 47:09.359
At least there won't be
any wedding night surprises.

47:10.394 --> 47:11.528
Huh?

47:12.763 --> 47:14.431
A little help here, please.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.099
Ooh! There!

47:18.568 --> 47:21.004
Hmm. Thanks!

47:21.071 --> 47:23.607
No time to waste. Let's go.

48:11.754 --> 48:13.156
Thut

48:15.391 --> 48:19.262
<i> Attention.</i>

48:19.329 --> 48:22.098

48:22.165 --> 48:23.933
From the sky!

48:24.000 --> 48:27.571
It's Ra!
The voice of the Sun God.

48:27.637 --> 48:33.276
Oh, Ra, God of the Sun,
God of Life, light our path!

48:33.343 --> 48:35.144
What should we do, oh, Ra?

48:35.211 --> 48:37.681
<i> Please, kindly
finish your shopping...</i>

48:37.747 --> 48:41.050
-We have.

48:41.117 --> 48:43.754

48:43.820 --> 48:48.692
-Oh! That way!
-Oh, thank you, magnificent Ra!

48:54.630 --> 48:57.134
Yeah! Lookin'... uh--

48:58.635 --> 48:59.536
Yeah!

49:01.304 --> 49:03.106
Listen, I've got the song
loaded up.

49:03.173 --> 49:04.774
We're ready to stream
a live performance!

49:04.840 --> 49:07.110
I've been promoting
through my Insta all afternoon.

49:07.176 --> 49:08.945
Ed, we don't speak Latin.

49:09.012 --> 49:10.346
They won't just hear you,

49:10.413 --> 49:12.082
they're gonna see you as well.

49:12.148 --> 49:14.851
-They'll see me?
-Of course, on the computer.

49:14.918 --> 49:18.321
Will I fit in there?

49:18.388 --> 49:20.557
No, not you!
It is a "streaming."

49:20.623 --> 49:24.127
"Live Internet"?
You don't get it, dude.

49:25.161 --> 49:28.031
You are going to slay.

49:28.098 --> 49:29.365
Slay?

49:29.432 --> 49:32.301
It means do a good job,
right bro?

49:32.368 --> 49:34.404
I don't think
this is a good idea.

49:34.471 --> 49:37.941
It's the first time someone
has ever asked me to sing.

49:38.008 --> 49:39.041
-But, Nefer...
-Thut!

49:39.108 --> 49:41.244
Time is running out.

49:53.056 --> 49:56.026
Then make this decision.
I'll support you.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.595
Wow. Thanks, Thut.

49:59.662 --> 50:01.631
That means a lot.

50:03.132 --> 50:08.905
Well, do your thing.

50:08.972 --> 50:12.009
Gimme five! Up top! Hah!

50:14.711 --> 50:15.745
Yeah!

50:15.811 --> 50:18.148
Yeah!

51:39.496 --> 51:41.864

51:41.931 --> 51:43.500

52:00.282 --> 52:03.186
You know what?

52:03.252 --> 52:05.288
Perhaps this is my place.

52:05.355 --> 52:07.356
I've only been here a few days

52:07.423 --> 52:09.659
and already my dreams
are coming true.

52:11.260 --> 52:14.498
That's... really good...
for you.

52:16.099 --> 52:17.767
Oh, come on, you'll be fine.

52:17.834 --> 52:20.770
I gave you my word

52:20.837 --> 52:22.305
We'll find it.

52:34.384 --> 52:36.252
He's not like the rest.

52:36.319 --> 52:38.053
Maybe we...

52:38.120 --> 52:40.390
Come on, what am I saying?

52:40.456 --> 52:42.459
I know, I know.

52:42.526 --> 52:44.127
We're from two
different worlds, anyway.

52:52.001 --> 52:53.570
Croc! It's Croc!

52:53.637 --> 52:55.605
Something's wrong with him!

52:58.742 --> 52:59.676
Nefer!

53:01.944 --> 53:03.480
Nefer! No!

53:20.764 --> 53:21.765
Nefer!

53:22.598 --> 53:24.067
Where are they taking her?

53:24.133 --> 53:26.703
I recognize those men.

53:26.769 --> 53:28.471
We need to follow that chariot.

53:28.538 --> 53:30.373
It belongs
to the Carnaby Museum.

53:30.440 --> 53:31.874
How do you know that?
Are you in on this?

53:31.941 --> 53:34.577
-Was this your plan all along?
-What? In on this?

53:34.644 --> 53:36.546
The van belongs
to the Carnaby Museum.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.415
It said it on the side!

53:38.481 --> 53:42.552
I blame you for this, Ed.
So stay out of my way, got it?

53:42.619 --> 53:46.188
I'll get to that museum.
I've got a princess to save.

53:46.255 --> 53:47.857
You're crazy.
You'll never get in.

53:47.923 --> 53:50.660
Their security is mental!

53:52.228 --> 53:55.231
No. You stay here.
It's dangerous.

53:55.298 --> 53:58.301
I'm your brother
and you will obey me.

54:26.129 --> 54:27.631
Princess...

54:35.604 --> 54:37.207
Princess...

54:37.273 --> 54:39.241
Princess Nefer.

54:39.308 --> 54:41.811
So delightful to meet you.

54:41.878 --> 54:45.115
Let me...
Let me go.

54:45.181 --> 54:47.951
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

54:48.018 --> 54:51.688
This morning is the opening
of my greatest exhibition yet.

54:56.326 --> 55:00.930
Originally, the centerpiece
was going to be your ring.

55:00.996 --> 55:03.299
But now... you.

55:03.366 --> 55:06.536
You are my greatest discovery.

55:06.603 --> 55:08.738
And when I reveal you
to the world,

55:08.805 --> 55:13.076
yours won't be the only name
that goes down in history.

55:13.142 --> 55:16.780
And if you thought your
little song made you famous,

55:16.846 --> 55:20.483
wait until they find out
what you really are!

55:20.550 --> 55:22.685
You can't do this.

55:22.751 --> 55:25.355
-Thut will...
-I can see you!

55:25.422 --> 55:27.791
He will come for me.

55:29.458 --> 55:34.197
There you are!

55:34.264 --> 55:36.399
Now... if you'll excuse me,

55:36.466 --> 55:39.035
I've an exhibition to prepare.

55:43.006 --> 55:45.008
THE CARNABY MUSEUM

56:13.837 --> 56:16.505
Wait, this is all my stuff!

56:16.572 --> 56:19.475
Wow, an entire section
dedicated to me.

56:19.542 --> 56:21.477
"The treasures
of Thut the Fleet of Foot."

56:21.544 --> 56:23.346
What a nickname!
Hmm?

56:23.413 --> 56:25.281
One hundred-time
chariot racing champion?

56:25.348 --> 56:27.950
What? It's 112 plus one.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.152
Idiots.

56:31.821 --> 56:32.789
Nefer?

56:34.390 --> 56:36.392
Nefer!

56:36.459 --> 56:38.561
Oh, no.
What have they done to you?

56:38.627 --> 56:41.464
You look like humans,
but you're really

56:41.530 --> 56:43.633
ancient Egyptian mummies.

56:44.667 --> 56:48.637
-You!
-Welcome to your new home.

56:48.704 --> 56:51.206
Not so fast!

56:51.273 --> 56:52.142
Huh?

57:36.352 --> 57:41.057
Look, bro. I can help.
Let's rescue the grumpy guy.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.160
Ha...

57:45.327 --> 57:47.463
I can't.

57:47.530 --> 57:49.532
Oh, jeez. I'm in bad shape.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.968
Don't worry.
You stay here, watching.

57:52.734 --> 57:55.071
Hold it. I see a hawk.

58:05.514 --> 58:06.616
Shh!

58:09.485 --> 58:10.953
You sure this is okay, Danny?

58:11.020 --> 58:13.957
Lord Carnaby said not to leave
the princess unattended.

58:14.023 --> 58:16.059
We're the only ones
in the building.

58:16.125 --> 58:18.394
Besides, how can we
protect the princess

58:18.461 --> 58:19.862
on an empty stomach?

58:19.929 --> 58:22.165
Uh, all right. Makes sense.

58:24.366 --> 58:25.869
SNACKERS

58:32.174 --> 58:33.877
Uh-oh. What have we done?

58:34.343 --> 58:35.245
Hmm.

58:37.646 --> 58:39.249
Umm... Ah-ha!

58:40.015 --> 58:41.150
Perfect.

58:55.698 --> 58:58.101
Thut?

58:59.369 --> 59:02.738
You know what?
I think you're cute.

59:02.805 --> 59:05.041
Thanks. You're pretty.

59:05.107 --> 59:06.876
We've got
to get them out, quick!

59:06.943 --> 59:09.211
I told you to keep watch
over the princess.

59:09.278 --> 59:12.681
Sorry, Mr. Carnaby.

59:12.748 --> 59:16.219
Then we got stuck
in the vending machine.

59:18.421 --> 59:20.623
Mm-hmm.

59:22.324 --> 59:25.328
Mm.

59:25.394 --> 59:27.163
It's coming
from the exhibition.

59:27.229 --> 59:29.098
It's the princess!

59:29.164 --> 59:31.534
Don't just stand there,
you blithering idiots!

59:31.600 --> 59:33.669
My... my chocky bar is...

59:33.736 --> 59:36.005
Get the princess!

59:37.506 --> 59:38.741
Are you okay?

59:38.808 --> 59:39.809
Hey, Thut...

59:39.876 --> 59:44.012
Sekhem is so... so hero-ish.

59:44.079 --> 59:47.150
Thanks.
He learned it all from me.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.156
Someone's been here.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.957
Keep your eyes peeled.

59:55.024 --> 59:58.328
It's them!
Quick, hide!

1:00:04.033 --> 1:00:07.536
and I can stand
on my own two feet.

1:00:07.603 --> 1:00:09.371
Huh?

1:00:09.438 --> 1:00:10.773
What was that?

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:13.909
-Wha...
-Hm.

1:00:13.976 --> 1:00:16.312
Did I tell you
that you're cute?

1:00:16.379 --> 1:00:19.649
Yeah, I...
I feel very strongly that you--

1:00:20.550 --> 1:00:22.885
Ew! They're kissing! Blech!

1:00:29.625 --> 1:00:31.060
The ring!

1:00:31.827 --> 1:00:34.197
No. She's escaped!

1:00:34.263 --> 1:00:36.465
You fools! You imbeciles!

1:00:36.531 --> 1:00:38.401
I give you one job...

1:00:42.071 --> 1:00:43.705
Guys?

1:00:43.772 --> 1:00:45.508
-Ha-ha!
-Hoo-hoo!

1:00:45.575 --> 1:00:47.342
We escaped your little trap!

1:00:47.409 --> 1:00:51.847
Now, we'll ruin
your special little
opening day.

1:00:51.914 --> 1:00:54.083
Stop!

1:01:00.756 --> 1:01:04.327
Ha!

1:01:04.393 --> 1:01:06.996
-Go!
-Get them.

1:01:18.307 --> 1:01:19.842
Hey!

1:01:23.545 --> 1:01:24.547
Hah!

1:01:30.052 --> 1:01:31.220
Come on!

1:01:33.355 --> 1:01:34.257
Ha-hah!

1:01:39.027 --> 1:01:40.963
Hey, look! Let's get that!

1:01:43.865 --> 1:01:45.667
There they go! Quick!

1:01:45.734 --> 1:01:47.570
Chariot driver,
drive the chariot!

1:01:47.636 --> 1:01:50.339
Well, I've... never driven
a chariot like this.

1:01:50.406 --> 1:01:52.308
I did! I can do it!

1:01:52.374 --> 1:01:54.776
-Please!
-What, seriously, the kid?

1:01:56.378 --> 1:01:59.949
-Go!
-Croc, buddy, get the pedals.

1:02:06.255 --> 1:02:08.291
Ugh! Get the van! Get the van!

1:02:13.629 --> 1:02:16.398
Where do I go?

1:02:16.465 --> 1:02:18.300
Yeah! Ra is with us!

1:02:18.367 --> 1:02:20.903
-Ra is a woman?
-Got a problem with that?

1:02:23.706 --> 1:02:25.007
I'm obeying the rules
of the road.

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:27.443
-The speed limit is--
-Forget the speed limit.

1:02:27.510 --> 1:02:29.478
Get out of the way. Let me.

1:02:29.545 --> 1:02:31.180
Right. Here we go.

1:02:34.516 --> 1:02:35.818
Croc, come on!

1:02:40.890 --> 1:02:42.658
Slow down, slow down,
slow down, slow down!

1:02:42.724 --> 1:02:44.126
You don't slow down in a chase!

1:02:44.193 --> 1:02:46.496
Not slowing down
is the whole point!

1:02:48.364 --> 1:02:50.899
<i> Next stop,
Russell Square Station.</i>

1:02:50.966 --> 1:02:53.368
<i>Final destination, South Bank.</i>

1:02:53.435 --> 1:02:55.738
Ra says to stop next!
Do what Ra says!

1:02:55.805 --> 1:02:57.440
No, he says to stop
at the pier!

1:02:57.506 --> 1:03:00.042
Don't worry, big brother.
He who dares wins!

1:03:00.108 --> 1:03:03.813
Dies! We're gonna die!

1:03:03.879 --> 1:03:06.849
They won't get away from me.
I want my mummy!

1:03:06.916 --> 1:03:08.984
-<i> Calling Mommy.</i>
-I meant that mummy!

1:03:09.051 --> 1:03:10.486
-<i> Calling Mommy.</i>
-No, I know...

1:03:10.553 --> 1:03:12.521
<i> Sylvester?
What are you doing?</i>

1:03:12.588 --> 1:03:14.256
Not now, Mother! I'm driving!

1:03:14.322 --> 1:03:16.893
<i> It's not safe to drive
and talk on the phone.</i>

1:03:22.398 --> 1:03:24.133
Croc!

1:03:25.601 --> 1:03:27.503
Whoa!

1:03:41.850 --> 1:03:43.952
I'll show you!

1:03:44.019 --> 1:03:46.489
I can't shake him.
What do I do?

1:03:47.423 --> 1:03:48.424
Thut!

1:03:55.230 --> 1:03:57.800
See that ramp up ahead?
Drive right for it.

1:03:57.867 --> 1:03:59.535
But that boat,
it's already leaving.

1:03:59.602 --> 1:04:02.038
Then we'd better go faster.

1:04:15.384 --> 1:04:17.220
Now! Turn and slam the brakes!

1:04:35.671 --> 1:04:38.774
You made it! Way to go, boss!

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.276
Yeah, but the people
we were chasing are back there.

1:04:41.343 --> 1:04:43.312
-Guess we can't get 'em now.
-Shut up, would you?

1:04:43.379 --> 1:04:47.083
I will chase them to the end
of the world if necessary.

1:04:48.050 --> 1:04:50.686
You haven't seen
the last of me!

1:04:50.753 --> 1:04:52.154
Bye.

1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:54.290
Yeah!

1:04:54.356 --> 1:04:56.259
-We're safe!
-Well done!

1:05:02.298 --> 1:05:04.500
You were great, Sekhem.

1:05:04.567 --> 1:05:05.968
Thanks, big bro.

1:05:11.206 --> 1:05:13.776
So, fancy explaining

1:05:13.843 --> 1:05:16.679
why a chariot racer
is frightened of going fast?

1:05:16.745 --> 1:05:18.480
Oh, that. Oh, well...

1:05:18.547 --> 1:05:21.383
It's just that
I don't feel comfortable

1:05:21.449 --> 1:05:23.119
driving a chariot
with no horses.

1:05:23.185 --> 1:05:25.321
I don't trust what I can't see.

1:05:29.558 --> 1:05:31.093
kissing you at the museum,
I just--

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:32.561
-Oh, yeah. I--
-I just wasn't think--

1:05:32.628 --> 1:05:34.397
-And this dart--
-No, I'm sorry for that.

1:05:34.463 --> 1:05:36.732
I mean, I'm also sorry
about the kissing.

1:05:36.799 --> 1:05:38.500
Yeah, well, good, good, good,

1:05:38.567 --> 1:05:40.069
that we can be honest
with each other.

1:05:41.370 --> 1:05:43.204
Okay, mummies,
back to the After World.

1:05:43.271 --> 1:05:45.674
Let's walk like Egyptians!

1:05:45.741 --> 1:05:48.076
Yeah. We've only got two suns
before the curse falls,

1:05:48.143 --> 1:05:49.211
and I lose my eyes and tongue.

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:51.380
I mean, you know, the usual.

1:05:51.447 --> 1:05:52.748
Well, let's just
use the Stargate.

1:05:52.815 --> 1:05:56.519
It's over there.

1:05:56.585 --> 1:05:57.820
That's a Ferris Wheel.

1:05:57.886 --> 1:06:00.289
Oh, so no time travel?

1:06:00.356 --> 1:06:03.592
Just all the time...
at the same place.

1:06:03.659 --> 1:06:05.694
Oh, Ra.
Unless flying like a falcon

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:08.965
is a thing in the human world,
we're finished.

1:06:12.167 --> 1:06:14.103
Uh, yeah, wow!

1:06:14.170 --> 1:06:16.204
-Um, she's gorgeous.
-Let me--

1:06:16.271 --> 1:06:18.640
-Is that relevant?
-No. Wait.

1:06:18.707 --> 1:06:20.742
Wait for it...

1:06:20.809 --> 1:06:21.810
Yes!

1:06:21.877 --> 1:06:22.745
Huh.

1:06:28.950 --> 1:06:30.986
The God Horus?

1:06:31.053 --> 1:06:33.822
Horus himself is gonna take us?
Wow!

1:06:33.889 --> 1:06:37.059
Fly to Egypt
EGYPTAIR

1:06:37.126 --> 1:06:38.527
Hours! Five hours!

1:06:38.594 --> 1:06:39.795
-Perfect.
-Yes!

1:06:39.862 --> 1:06:41.530
Whoo!

1:06:47.736 --> 1:06:52.375
Well, I think it's time
for you to choose, Princess.

1:08:07.416 --> 1:08:09.184
So...

1:08:09.251 --> 1:08:11.220
Can you imagine
if we'd had to marry?

1:08:11.286 --> 1:08:14.189
You and me? Huh!
We'd be like oil and water.

1:08:14.255 --> 1:08:15.758
Totally.

1:08:22.297 --> 1:08:25.734
But you know, I...
should probably thank you.

1:08:25.801 --> 1:08:28.404
You were very brave,
charioteer.

1:08:28.470 --> 1:08:31.874
Uh... No. Not at all.

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:35.544
In fact, I'm not actually
who you think I am.

1:08:37.012 --> 1:08:39.582
<i>I retired because I got scared.</i>

1:08:42.451 --> 1:08:45.654
<i> And since then,
speed makes me panic.</i>

1:08:46.889 --> 1:08:49.090
So... no.

1:08:49.157 --> 1:08:51.894
I'm not brave. Not at all.

1:08:59.267 --> 1:09:00.869
If you weren't brave,

1:09:00.936 --> 1:09:03.572
you wouldn't have
risked your life to rescue me.

1:09:09.445 --> 1:09:11.680
You're braver
than you think, Thut.

1:09:12.948 --> 1:09:16.552
Yeah, well... I don't know.

1:09:28.130 --> 1:09:29.798
Give it here! Give it!

1:09:34.169 --> 1:09:38.206
Look, just 'cause you
went to the posh school--

1:10:43.004 --> 1:10:44.205
-So...
-You, uh...

1:10:44.272 --> 1:10:46.408
Oh. Sorry. No, you...

1:10:46.474 --> 1:10:50.345
Uh, well, I suppose...

1:10:50.412 --> 1:10:53.314
it's goodbye, Princess.

1:10:53.381 --> 1:10:55.718
Goodbye, charioteer.

1:11:12.567 --> 1:11:14.336
Turn around.

1:11:24.713 --> 1:11:26.548
Turn around, please.

1:12:04.486 --> 1:12:07.455
I'm sorry, Father.
I was afraid that--

1:12:07.522 --> 1:12:10.459
You can't imagine
how worried I have been.

1:13:30.505 --> 1:13:33.075
A city of living mummies.

1:13:34.142 --> 1:13:36.445
The legend lives.

1:13:36.512 --> 1:13:38.547
Whoa!
It wasn't a legend after all.

1:13:38.614 --> 1:13:41.383
Not after today, Danny.
Not after today.

1:13:41.450 --> 1:13:43.585
He's Danny, I'm Dennys.

1:13:43.652 --> 1:13:45.720
Do not ruin the moment.

1:13:45.787 --> 1:13:48.456
Uh... where is the princess?

1:13:48.523 --> 1:13:50.025
Princess? Heh!

1:13:50.092 --> 1:13:53.529
Who needs a princess
when you can have a pharaoh?

1:13:56.164 --> 1:13:58.767
Sire, they've managed
to infiltrate the city

1:13:58.834 --> 1:14:00.769
using the metal beasts.

1:14:01.836 --> 1:14:03.705
Take everybody to the shelter.

1:14:03.772 --> 1:14:05.540
I'll deploy
the city's defenses.

1:14:05.607 --> 1:14:06.942
Go with them.

1:14:20.321 --> 1:14:24.626
Lord Carnaby requests
an audience with the Pharaoh.

1:14:28.997 --> 1:14:31.066
They took away my exhibition.

1:14:31.132 --> 1:14:33.067
They scoff at my name.

1:14:33.134 --> 1:14:36.772
But I will show them
a living pharaoh.

1:14:43.311 --> 1:14:44.646
Nefer, stay back!

1:14:44.713 --> 1:14:46.314
This is my fault.

1:14:46.381 --> 1:14:48.183
He followed me here.

1:14:48.249 --> 1:14:50.085
This is my fight, too.

1:15:01.696 --> 1:15:03.799
Thut! Thut!

1:15:03.865 --> 1:15:05.868
He's here!

1:15:07.502 --> 1:15:09.303
The one from the museum,
he's come!

1:15:09.370 --> 1:15:11.038
We're under attack!

1:15:11.105 --> 1:15:12.874
If he wants to come,
let him come.

1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:16.478
It's that or an eternity
signing autographs. Alone.

1:15:16.545 --> 1:15:18.780
Oh, come on!
The princess needs you!

1:15:18.846 --> 1:15:20.782
She's got guards.

1:15:22.617 --> 1:15:24.686
She needs the bravest
among us.

1:15:24.752 --> 1:15:26.788
The supreme champion.

1:15:26.854 --> 1:15:30.224
And that's you. "He who dares."

1:15:30.291 --> 1:15:31.827
That's my older brother.

1:15:31.894 --> 1:15:33.928
That's who I look up to
and idolize.

1:15:33.995 --> 1:15:36.932
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and go help her.

1:16:00.288 --> 1:16:02.490
Father!

1:16:02.557 --> 1:16:05.594
No... Father!

1:16:27.515 --> 1:16:29.084
I don't believe it!

1:16:34.255 --> 1:16:36.491
-You're not going anywhere.
-Whoa! Whoa!

1:16:36.558 --> 1:16:38.359
Foolish child!

1:16:38.426 --> 1:16:40.128
You won't get away with this!

1:16:40.195 --> 1:16:43.632
You want to come too?
Pesky spoiled brat!

1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:13.461
No.

1:17:13.528 --> 1:17:16.163
-Thut!
-The Charioteer!

1:17:17.699 --> 1:17:19.134
He's getting away!

1:17:19.201 --> 1:17:20.268
Hyah!

1:17:21.736 --> 1:17:24.339
Go, go, go!

1:17:25.107 --> 1:17:26.775
Croc!

1:17:46.494 --> 1:17:47.663
No!

1:17:48.230 --> 1:17:49.131
Hyah!

1:18:00.175 --> 1:18:01.209
Here we go.

1:18:09.050 --> 1:18:11.186
Thut, what are you doing?

1:18:11.253 --> 1:18:12.287
Thut!

1:18:13.655 --> 1:18:14.890
Look out!

1:18:17.325 --> 1:18:19.594
Thut, come on!
You can't let him get away!

1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:21.730
You are not alone.
You have a team.

1:18:21.796 --> 1:18:24.366
Thut! Not now, come on!

1:18:24.432 --> 1:18:25.801
Snap out of it!

1:18:26.568 --> 1:18:28.737
Thut! Wake up!

1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:35.043
Thut! Wake up, I need you!

1:18:37.712 --> 1:18:39.381
It's time to take the reins!

1:19:03.872 --> 1:19:06.174
Get off me, boy!
I've got you now.

1:19:06.241 --> 1:19:07.776
Thut!

1:19:13.481 --> 1:19:14.915
No!

1:19:14.982 --> 1:19:18.320
Now, you'll be my new trophy.

1:19:18.386 --> 1:19:19.721
-Nefer!
-Thut!

1:19:19.787 --> 1:19:22.124
I'll show you, mummy!

1:19:30.531 --> 1:19:32.200
No, no, no, no, no!

1:19:33.501 --> 1:19:34.770
I love you.

1:19:50.685 --> 1:19:52.921
No, no. Thut!

1:19:59.594 --> 1:20:01.296
Thut!

1:20:05.934 --> 1:20:07.102
Nefer!

1:20:07.702 --> 1:20:09.004
Father!

1:20:11.773 --> 1:20:13.341
That's my older brother.

1:20:20.448 --> 1:20:24.052
Young charioteer,
you saved my life.

1:20:24.119 --> 1:20:26.921
You did it!
You overcame your fear, Thut!

1:20:26.987 --> 1:20:29.825
No, it was you.

1:20:29.891 --> 1:20:32.059
I've been running from fear
this whole time.

1:20:32.126 --> 1:20:33.661
Whether it was fear
to race again

1:20:33.727 --> 1:20:36.064
or fear to love somebody.

1:20:41.669 --> 1:20:43.004
But instead...

1:20:44.906 --> 1:20:47.642
Will you marry me?

1:20:47.709 --> 1:20:50.578
Well, the Phoenix chose you,

1:20:50.645 --> 1:20:54.082
so technically,
I'm duty-bound to marry you.

1:20:56.551 --> 1:20:57.719
Yes, I will!

1:21:18.273 --> 1:21:22.343
By the power vested
in me by the Goddess of love,

1:21:22.409 --> 1:21:27.215
I pronounce you
wife and husband.

1:21:55.644 --> 1:21:58.280
<i> All the school kids
so sick of books</i>

1:21:58.346 --> 1:22:00.148
<i> They like the punk
and the metal band</i>

1:22:00.215 --> 1:22:02.951
<i> When the buzzer rings
Oh way oh</i>

1:22:03.018 --> 1:22:04.852
<i> They're walking like
an Egyptian</i>

1:22:04.919 --> 1:22:06.955
<i> All the kids
in the marketplace say</i>

1:22:07.021 --> 1:22:09.624
<i> Way oh way oh</i>

1:22:09.690 --> 1:22:12.694
<i> Way oh way oh</i>

1:22:14.128 --> 1:22:16.665
<i> Walk like an Egyptian</i>

1:22:18.032 --> 1:22:20.335
It's about time
things changed...

1:22:20.401 --> 1:22:21.135
I suppose.
