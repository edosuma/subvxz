<i>Since its debut,
true TV has brought you...</i>

01:01.762 --> 01:05.298
<i>The finest in documentary
and informational programming.</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:07.266
<i>You've counted on us,
and we've taken you there.</i>

01:07.267 --> 01:10.603
<i>From the edge of the world
to the edge of your seat,</i>

01:10.604 --> 01:13.439
<i>from the streets of L.A.
to the serengeti plain,</i>

01:13.440 --> 01:16.075
<i>from inner peace to outer space,</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:19.211
<i>your funniest moments
and most tragic times.</i>

01:19.212 --> 01:22.682
<i>You've laughed, you've cried,
you've almost died.</i>

01:22.683 --> 01:25.518
<i>But now we'll take you
where you've never been before.</i>

01:25.519 --> 01:29.388
<i>No script, no actors,
no editing.</i>

01:29.389 --> 01:29.999
<i>All day, all night, all true.</i>

01:30.000 --> 01:31.991
<i>All day, all night, all true.</i>

01:31.992 --> 01:35.394
<i>Every second is true
on true TV...</i>

01:35.395 --> 01:37.531
<i>This spring.</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:42.702
So, any questions?

01:42.703 --> 01:45.204
Yes?

01:45.205 --> 01:48.741
Okay, I think we get that
it's true, but what is it?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.510
Cynthia, why don't you come up here?
This is your moment.

01:51.511 --> 01:54.680
Folks, this is Cynthia topping. She's
the program director at true TV.

01:54.681 --> 01:59.385
She's the one that's gonna be strapped to
a scud missile if this idea doesn't work.

01:59.386 --> 01:59.999
Th-thank you, Mr. Whitaker.
I've always wanted to travel.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.656
Th-thank you, Mr. Whitaker.
I've always wanted to travel.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.524
The... missile. Yes?

02:05.525 --> 02:09.996
Isn't this show similar to a
show pbs had on in the '70s?

02:09.997 --> 02:13.332
- The loud family?
- No, no, this is completely different.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.335
We are gonna--
We're gonna pick one person,

02:16.336 --> 02:18.170
one--
All right.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.106
One normal person.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.209
Not like you folks.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.645
And we're gonna put that
person's life on television...

02:25.646 --> 02:28.714
All day long, uh, live.

02:28.715 --> 02:29.999
<i>It's not pbs.</i>
<i>It's not</i> real world.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.450
<i>It's not pbs.</i>
<i>It's not</i> real world.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.019
<i>We're not gonna film it
and then edit it later.</i>

02:33.020 --> 02:36.055
Is that how I sound? I don't
sound like that, do I?

02:36.056 --> 02:37.723
More or less. On a good day.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.026
You never said anything?

02:40.027 --> 02:43.295
I don't mean to be negative here.
Ooh!

02:43.296 --> 02:45.631
Hey!

02:45.632 --> 02:50.236
I know this was your idea, but doesn't
this have, like, a great chance of being--

02:50.237 --> 02:52.471
A big, smelly bomb?
Oh, you betcha! Yeah.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.509
And wouldn't that be,
you know, a bad thing?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.999
Keith, we're getting our butts
kicked by the gardening channel.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.313
Keith, we're getting our butts
kicked by the gardening channel.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.214
People would rather watch soil.

03:02.215 --> 03:07.319
We are this close to having chalk
outlines around our careers.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.189
I love that we're doing this,
and I <i>love</i> that it's risky.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.159
All anyone ever does in this
business is follow the pack.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.730
Hell, if people tune in to this twice
a day for five minutes, we're a hit.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.332
You know what finally convinced
me that this could work?

03:20.333 --> 03:23.536
Half a dozen wine coolers?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.471
When I realized that
the person we pick,

03:25.472 --> 03:28.607
the guy that's on TV all day
long, doesn't have to be good.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.999
- If he's good, great, but if he's bad, even better.
- Bad is better?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.112
- If he's good, great, but if he's bad, even better.
- Bad is better?

03:33.113 --> 03:35.581
People can't turn away
from an accident.

03:35.582 --> 03:40.086
You drive by and say, "ooh, I hope there's
not a head in the road. That would be--"

03:40.087 --> 03:42.521
but then you look.
You don't wanna miss it.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.357
So we put a guy on TV, and we
just sit and wait and see...

03:45.358 --> 03:48.394
If that head starts rollin'
down the highway.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.629
Now that's fun
for the whole family.

03:50.630 --> 03:56.336
- So, what's our next step?
- We find ourselves a big, fat rolling head.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.999
Are you seeing this?
Are you looking around you?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.307
Are you seeing this?
Are you looking around you?

04:01.308 --> 04:04.376
Are you--
God, you know what this is?

04:04.377 --> 04:06.979
This is a horror show.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.249
- What are you going off about now, John boy?
- This doesn't bug you?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.185
All our friends and
everybody getting married,

04:13.186 --> 04:15.521
and they're having kids
and, uh, careers.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.524
And their kids are having careers.
It's a mess. Why would that bug me?

04:19.526 --> 04:22.528
Look at us, right?
We are doin' fine.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.663
Oh. Okay.

04:24.664 --> 04:27.733
You have a beer around your neck.
Okay?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.401
- That's my point!
- Hey, there's ray!

04:29.402 --> 04:29.999
Your brother's here.
Hey, go long, man.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.520
Your brother's here.
Hey, go long, man.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.641
I'm gonna go over
and say hi to Kim.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.978
Yeah. Listen, that was great tonight.
I loved it.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.346
Oh, man!

04:40.347 --> 04:42.381
Insane, ray. What's
goin' on, man?

04:42.382 --> 04:44.583
I'm tellin' you, it's weird.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.252
We meet,
we go out a couple times,

04:46.253 --> 04:49.021
and then bing-bang-boom, she's
got me meetin' her parents.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.257
What do you mean,
bing-bang-boom, buddy?

04:51.258 --> 04:54.193
You've been goin' out with her
for six months.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.295
Yeah? Yeah.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.165
It suddenly feels like the walls
are closing in on me.

04:59.166 --> 04:59.999
You know? The father
is sitting there,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.735
you know? The father
is sitting there,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.670
asking me about
my career prospects.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.405
Can you believe that?

05:06.406 --> 05:09.008
And, oh, at dinner...

05:09.009 --> 05:11.443
The-- the dog
is sniffing my balls.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.412
At least I hope it was the dog,

05:13.413 --> 05:16.016
because her mother
disappeared for a while.

05:19.519 --> 05:24.456
- What's goin' on over there?
- They're doin' audition tapes for that true TV thing.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.226
People are sendin' 'em in
from all over the place.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.999
- Oh, yeah? That's cool!
- What's cool?

05:30.000 --> 05:30.629
- Oh, yeah? That's cool!
- What's cool?

05:30.630 --> 05:34.333
To be that guy, that guy they
watch all day. Get outta here.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.170
I'm telling you, mark my words.
That guy is gonna be famous.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.540
He'll be able to get whatever
he wants, whoever he wa--

05:41.541 --> 05:44.043
Hey, trust me.
This is my business.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.679
Wh-wh-what is? Show business.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.282
Oh, you in show business now?
Yeah, I service video equipment.

05:50.283 --> 05:56.156
That's like saying those people stitchin'
nikes in Panama are in the n.B.A.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.991
Hello?

05:58.992 --> 05:59.999
Bed-wetter. Thumb-sucker.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.194
Bed-wetter. Thumb-sucker.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.730
You know what? I'm gonna go make a tape.
You know what?

06:04.731 --> 06:07.499
I'm excited.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.402
All right, so-- I-I know
that I can do this.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.305
It's my turn.
I'm next. I'm next.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.040
Hey, buzz, can I get one more?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.609
You got it.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.245
Hello there.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.347
So ray met the family, huh?

06:21.348 --> 06:23.983
Oh, yeah.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.151
I heard the dog
really liked him.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.355
Yeah. The whole family
loved him.

06:29.356 --> 06:29.999
But of course, my whole family really
loved the last guy I went out with,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.259
but of course, my whole family really
loved the last guy I went out with,

06:33.260 --> 06:36.061
and he strung me along for
a year and then dumped me.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.064
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

06:40.433 --> 06:45.537
And, you know, every guy
I ever broke up with,

06:45.538 --> 06:49.008
the minute it's over, I could
tell you what went wrong.

06:49.009 --> 06:53.078
How it went wrong.
Why it <i>had</i> to go wrong.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.282
But when I'm in it--

06:55.749 --> 06:57.449
Lost.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.999
I'm like a love coroner.
You know?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.986
I'm like a love coroner.
You know?

07:00.987 --> 07:03.656
Bring me the corpse, I'll
tell you what killed it.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.526
But how to prevent it? Lost.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.995
Yeah!

07:09.996 --> 07:13.032
I'm ray pekurny!

07:13.033 --> 07:19.138
I'm from right here in San Francisco,
the greatest city in the world.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.473
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

07:21.474 --> 07:23.542
Go, niners!

07:23.543 --> 07:25.077
Yeah!

07:25.078 --> 07:26.512
How are things goin'?

07:26.513 --> 07:29.748
Okay, I want to introduce
you to my girlfriend.

07:29.749 --> 07:30.000
She's, uh-- she's really
cute, she's really cool,

07:30.001 --> 07:33.452
she's, uh-- she's really
cute, she's really cool,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.120
and she's...

07:35.121 --> 07:36.689
Really strong.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.425
She's a ups person.
She lifts packages.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.994
Not beefy or anything.
She told me this joke.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.064
What do you get when you
cross ups with fed ex?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.199
Fed up!

07:47.200 --> 07:48.500
It's her joke.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.638
Oh, my brother, my brother.
Ed, yeah, come on.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.508
Come on. Say somethin'.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.110
You're an asshole, man.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.999
No, come on, man. Say somethin'.
All right.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.013
No, come on, man. Say somethin'.
All right.

08:01.014 --> 08:05.684
Um, I don't know about this whole
24-hour TV thing y'all got goin',

08:05.685 --> 08:09.621
but if you are gonna go forward with
it, this is your man. Smart guy.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.157
The ray-man here.
This guy's got stories.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.060
This guy has lived. I've got stories.
I've lived!

08:15.061 --> 08:17.663
Tell 'em about that dog grooming
businessou started. No, not that story.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.566
<i>You gotta tell 'em about that.
No, I don't really wanna--</i>

08:20.567 --> 08:23.502
<i>Come on, ray! All right, I'm telling.
Here we go.</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:25.571
- This guy?
- Yeah, take a look at this kid.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.173
<i>He was gonna start up
a mobile dog groomin' business.</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:29.675
He's cute. Really?

08:29.676 --> 08:30.000
Yeah! Yeah!

08:30.001 --> 08:31.310
Yeah! Yeah!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.312
<i>He doesn't wanna be like
everybody else. No.</i>

08:33.313 --> 08:37.482
<i>He doesn't start it in a van or a
pickup truck or something like that.</i>

08:37.484 --> 08:42.321
<i>No, the ray-man, he starts
it in the... camry!</i>

08:42.322 --> 08:44.590
<i>- Camry!
- Camry! Camry!</i>

08:44.591 --> 08:45.691
<i>Two-door.</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:49.161
<i>So he gets a tub,
and he puts it in the trunk.</i>

08:49.162 --> 08:51.730
<i>He throws the dogs in the tub, slams
the trunk, starts drivin' around.</i>

08:51.731 --> 08:56.969
<i>Speeds up, stops real quick, turns left hard,
turns right to get the dogs all sudded up.</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.999
<i>Pretty smart, right? Now, guess
how he dries 'em off. Guess.</i>

09:00.000 --> 09:01.407
<i>Pretty smart, right? Now, guess
how he dries 'em off. Guess.</i>

09:01.408 --> 09:04.476
<i>With the exhaust!</i>

09:04.477 --> 09:08.347
What do you say? We bring him in.
Can't hurt. Just talk to him?

09:08.348 --> 09:12.985
Well, I'm from east Texas. Yep.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.687
And when I was like 13,

09:15.688 --> 09:20.359
my mom got remarried to my stepfather
who was a traveling salesman.

09:20.360 --> 09:25.130
He got transferred up here to San
Francisco, so we all came along.

09:25.131 --> 09:29.435
- Here we are. Here I am.
- Mm-hmm. Terrific.

09:29.436 --> 09:29.999
Did you go to college or-- I
had a year of junior college.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.371
Did you go to college or-- I
had a year of junior college.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.741
Home of the bear cats.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.343
Oh, scary.

09:38.344 --> 09:41.113
- What did you study?
- Studyin'?

09:41.114 --> 09:45.317
Um, geez, that'd have been a big help.
Where were you then?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.586
That's cute.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.989
Straight ahead. What?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.626
And as you see, I can get rid of
the Texas accent whenever I want.

09:54.627 --> 09:58.430
Or I can just slide...

09:58.431 --> 09:59.999
Real deep on into it like this.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.733
Real deep on into it like this.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.336
How do you decide?

10:04.671 --> 10:09.475
To tell you the truth, I find that, uh...
This accent here...

10:09.476 --> 10:12.212
don't do me no harm
with the ladies.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.283
Know what I mean, darlin'?

10:19.986 --> 10:22.222
Yeah.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.723
No, never been married.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.426
Um,

10:27.427 --> 10:29.999
I've been burned
a couple times, though.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.163
I've been burned
a couple times, though.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.698
My father?

10:34.534 --> 10:37.436
Um... well, let's see.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.671
When I was 12,
my mom got a hysterectomy.

10:39.672 --> 10:43.308
He ran off with her nurse,
and I haven't seen him since.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.546
That's my dad, Hank pekurny.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.149
Next question?

10:50.150 --> 10:54.653
Like, one time I was-- I was playing
peewee football back in Texas, right?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.421
And I dislocated my finger.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.725
Mom comes rolling out of the bleachers,
busts through this little group of kids,

10:59.726 --> 11:00.000
grabs my finger-- whack!

11:00.001 --> 11:01.760
Grabs my finger-- whack!

11:01.761 --> 11:04.730
Pops it back into place, runs up, slaps
the coach upside the head and says,

11:04.731 --> 11:06.366
"let's get the game on!"

11:08.401 --> 11:10.702
That's mom.

11:10.703 --> 11:15.542
I-I... still can't really
bend this finger though.

11:19.979 --> 11:23.248
<i>Uh, a dream? Oh, yeah,
man, I got a dream.</i>

11:23.249 --> 11:25.551
<i>I, uh--</i>

11:25.552 --> 11:28.555
<i>I just don't know
what it is yet, you know?</i>

11:45.738 --> 11:49.142
Did you test him?
Did you do any research?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.077
Research?

11:52.078 --> 11:55.180
We don't even have money in our
budget for coffee filters.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.482
We're using a yarmulke.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.619
But this is who you want?

12:01.621 --> 12:05.357
I'm going based on something you
once said at a broadcasters' dinner.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.359
Ha! I love it.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.728
I love it.
You see what she does?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.396
See what she does?

12:11.397 --> 12:14.032
She attaches me to her choice,

12:14.033 --> 12:17.636
thereby fueling my massive ego
and forcing me to like it.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.573
You're great! How come you
never doodle my name?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.475
I-I do. I--
I'm joking.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.277
I'm joking.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.613
Once again.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.999
This is the guy
you want to go with?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.400
This is the guy
you want to go with?

12:35.388 --> 12:36.990
Yes.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.329
What happens when you go to the bathroom?
Do they go in with ya?

12:44.330 --> 12:47.366
No, al! I mean, the
bathroom's out of bounds.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.101
Dinner's gettin' cold!

12:49.102 --> 12:52.204
My life is not so great that I
want it shown on television.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.139
And neither is yours, ed.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.508
That's the whole point.
This could change all that.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.043
How?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.999
I'm glad you asked.
I want to open a gym.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.247
I'm glad you asked.
I want to open a gym.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.216
- A gymnasium?
- No, no, a gym.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.619
A gymnasium is an old, white guy
shootin' free throws like this.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.721
I'm talkin' a modern-day
fitness center.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.657
What does this have
to do with ed?

13:11.658 --> 13:15.260
If ed is on TV for a month,
he gets a balloon payment.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.195
That's big money.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.532
I'd borrow against that right now
at the bank, I'd buy the gym,

13:20.533 --> 13:26.138
I make ed a silent partner, and I cut all you
in for a slice because you signed the releases.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.999
- This is gonna cost us.
- - It's not gonna c-- hey, look.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.043
- This is gonna cost us.
- - It's not gonna c-- hey, look.

13:30.044 --> 13:33.545
Open your eyes instead of your mouth
for once. This is a no-brainer.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.683
The whole time I'm gonna
be promoting the gym on TV.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.618
It's free advertising.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.388
I mean--
Does anyone else see this?

13:43.556 --> 13:44.757
How 'bout sex?

13:46.759 --> 13:49.728
I'm sorry, al, but I'm
gonna have to pass.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.031
And it's not an age thing, 'cause
you are still a handsome man.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.702
No! Do they show you having sex?

13:56.703 --> 13:59.999
No, al.
Look, kissin' and huggin'.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.639
No, al.
Look, kissin' and huggin'.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.008
- Nudity?
- Ed, you're not gonna be nude.

14:03.009 --> 14:07.112
- Why would I be nude, ma?
- What kind of a show is this? It's a filthy show!

14:07.113 --> 14:10.248
It is not a filthy show. Have you
even read the whole contract?

14:10.249 --> 14:13.585
- Do you even know what's in it?
- Oh, little miss cautious.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.254
She meets a guy in a bar,
she's married an hour later.

14:16.255 --> 14:20.692
- We didn't get married, we just thought we were married.
- Marcia, calm down, honey.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.762
He's pickin' at me, and he's
bringin' up all kinds of issues.

14:23.763 --> 14:28.100
Married is married is married.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.999
What isn't? All of it.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.036
What isn't? All of it.

14:30.037 --> 14:34.373
The whole thing. You know? Maybe I'll just
get out now before it gets complicated.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.610
No harm, no foul. Great. They had
to pick you. They couldn't pick me.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.012
If he doesn't want to do it--

14:41.013 --> 14:45.617
If he doesn't want to do it? He's 31
years old! He's a video store clerk!

14:45.618 --> 14:48.153
What is his
grand master plan here?

14:48.154 --> 14:50.655
What, is he gonna spend
the rest of his life...

14:50.656 --> 14:52.724
Rearranging <i>Ernest</i> movies?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.761
Everyone who works there
is 12 years old.

14:55.762 --> 14:59.498
They go through college, they graduate,
and then they stop working there.

14:59.499 --> 14:59.999
Except for him! He stays to welcome
the next batch of 12-year-olds.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.468
Except for him! He stays to welcome
the next batch of 12-year-olds.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.737

it's a job for retards!

15:05.738 --> 15:08.040
Ray, stop that!

15:09.308 --> 15:10.742

15:10.743 --> 15:12.377
Uh-huh.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.745
Yeah, kinda.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.149

I mean, a fella can't--

15:17.150 --> 15:20.386

15:22.155 --> 15:24.656

I'm not scared.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.658

15:26.659 --> 15:29.361
You're scared, man. You're scared.
I'm not scared.

15:29.362 --> 15:29.999
I am not scared, ray. I know you got
that Doe-in-the-headlights look.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.331
I am not scared, ray. I know you got
that Doe-in-the-headlights look.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.635
You're mixing your proteins
and starches, and you can't--

15:36.636 --> 15:41.206
I'll tell you what. You don't have to
worry about anything. You know why? Huh?

15:41.207 --> 15:45.377
No. Why? Because big brother's
riding shotgun, man.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.179
I've got your back.

15:47.180 --> 15:51.650
Now, did anything ever happen to you when
you were a kid? Anyone ever bother you?

15:51.651 --> 15:55.287
Just you. Just-- just me.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.223
You bring those cameras over to
big brother, and I promise you...

15:58.224 --> 15:59.999

22:39.558 --> 22:41.593
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:41.594 --> 22:44.996
If this guy collects his toe
cheese, I'm outta here.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.600
<i>Some guys start here, then down
to the little toe. That ain't me.</i>

22:48.601 --> 22:50.536
<i>I save the big one...</i>

22:53.005 --> 22:55.173
<i>For last.</i>

22:55.174 --> 22:59.478
<i>'Cause it's bigger. You gotta do some work.
You gotta be an artiste.</i>

23:00.579 --> 23:02.615
<i>Look at that.</i>

23:04.083 --> 23:06.351
<i>Oh!</i>

23:06.352 --> 23:09.754
No. No, I haven't seen
the spot ratings.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.391
<i>You know how you're watching the big
game and you gotta do your business?</i>

23:13.392 --> 23:15.526
<i>Right? The worst time to do it.</i>

23:15.527 --> 23:20.765
Yeah. That's a number that, you know,
hopefully we can obvi-- we'll build from.

23:20.766 --> 23:25.303
<i>I don't have to anymore. Check that out.
I designed this.</i>

23:25.304 --> 23:29.999
No, I disagree. I don't think
it's time to pull the plug.

23:30.000 --> 23:30.276
No, I disagree. I don't think
it's time to pull the plug.

23:30.277 --> 23:33.144
Yes, Mr. Whitaker,
I know they shoot horses.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.580
<i>What do you see? What is that?</i>

23:35.581 --> 23:38.983
<i>That is the TV. And where am I?</i>

23:38.984 --> 23:40.618
<i>I am on the can.</i>

23:40.619 --> 23:44.555
<i>At the same time I am on the
can, but yet I am still a fan.</i>

23:44.556 --> 23:47.058
You know, it's been one day.

23:47.059 --> 23:51.763
Can you give me a week with this guy,
and then you fly up my nose? Hello?

23:51.764 --> 23:56.534
<i>Somebody smart said,
"practicality wins out."</i>

23:56.535 --> 23:59.999
<i>So, in this bathroom
I'm a... winner.</i>

24:00.000 --> 24:01.440
<i>So, in this bathroom
I'm a... winner.</i>

24:02.074 --> 24:04.342
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:04.343 --> 24:07.045
Five.

24:07.046 --> 24:11.349
Six. Seven.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.719
Eight. Nine!

24:14.720 --> 24:17.990
Come on, ray,
she's not that heavy.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.028
Yeah! Yeah!

24:24.163 --> 24:26.297
You shifted your weight.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.200
I'm not hurt. I'm not hurt.
I'm okay.

24:29.201 --> 24:29.999
Ray's gym!
Now accepting applications!

24:30.000 --> 24:32.603
Ray's gym!
Now accepting applications!

24:32.604 --> 24:36.541
We want your body! Ray's! Look
what he did for me. Huh? Huh?

24:36.542 --> 24:39.377
All right! Oh, god!

24:39.378 --> 24:41.446
Hey, John boy!

24:41.447 --> 24:45.283
What do you like about it?
I don't understand.

24:45.284 --> 24:50.288
I don't know. It's just that--
Well-- just let me watch.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.657
<i>You're gonna love this.
This is a great story.</i>

24:52.658 --> 24:56.995
<i>I got a great story. You remember marcia?
Of course. She's our sister.</i>

24:56.996 --> 24:59.999
<i>You know she's goin' out
with this new guy.</i>

25:00.000 --> 25:00.765
<i>You know she's goin' out
with this new guy.</i>

25:00.766 --> 25:04.569
<i>- They're livin' together.
- You want to save this till later?</i>

25:04.570 --> 25:06.671
<i>No, no, now's the perfect time.</i>

25:06.672 --> 25:11.042
He's a singer in a piano bar. Sings, plays
the piano. And that's how they met.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.612
- He sang to her and they fell in love.
- - Not even, buzz.

25:14.613 --> 25:19.283
No. Get this. Some drunk hit him
in the head with a snifter.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.519
<i>One of those things you
keep on the bar for tips?</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:23.654
<i>You don't know, buzz,
'cause you never get tips.</i>

25:23.655 --> 25:26.724
<i>He hit him over the head 'cause he's
terrible. He's wretched. He's awful.</i>

25:26.725 --> 25:29.999
<i>He's dreadful. He sucks.
I'm tellin' ya, right?</i>

25:30.000 --> 25:30.062
<i>He's dreadful. He sucks.
I'm tellin' ya, right?</i>

25:30.063 --> 25:34.332
That's what happened. She's pullin'
a chunk of glass out of his skull,

25:34.333 --> 25:37.235
and he bleeds on her,
and that's all she needs!

25:37.236 --> 25:39.504
Bing! It's <i>amore,</i> right?

25:39.505 --> 25:45.343
The question I'm askin' is, what's she
doin' in a bar in the first place?

25:45.344 --> 25:47.045
She's an alcoholic,
for Christ's sakes!

25:47.046 --> 25:50.481
No, ray, buddy, not here.

25:50.482 --> 25:53.585
Come on, now. I gotta pee.
I gotta pee.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.123
Hey, what, are you hidin'
from the police or somethin'?

25:59.124 --> 25:59.999
Come on, show yourself.
Look, is she beautiful?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.660
Come on, show yourself.
Look, is she beautiful?

26:02.661 --> 26:05.229
She's beautiful, right?
That's my girl.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.966
While I'm gone, Edward, tell 'em
about that time we lied to mom...

26:08.967 --> 26:11.270
<i>And then went to Tijuana
to find the donkey show.</i>

26:14.073 --> 26:16.742
I got her. I got her.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.579
You are though.

26:21.713 --> 26:23.148
What?

26:24.049 --> 26:25.984
Beautiful.

26:31.457 --> 26:34.692
Thank you. You're welcome.
Yeah, bud?

26:34.693 --> 26:40.098
I'm taking a poll on whether
or not I should shave my head.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.633
<i>I've had about 19 beers,
so take that into account.</i>

26:42.634 --> 26:45.403
Barry, did you see that? What?

26:45.404 --> 26:48.739
The girl. The look. Yeah.

26:48.740 --> 26:52.243
She likes the ed guy better
than she likes the brother.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.679
I don't think I like it.
I don't think it's nice.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.014
It's a good set of hair
you got on your head now.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.999
I've had about enough of this.
Give me the remote.

27:00.000 --> 27:00.352
I've had about enough of this.
Give me the remote.

27:00.353 --> 27:03.122
Just a few more minutes.

Hey, ed, you want my autograph?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.748
Okeydokey.

Ten dollars?

little eight-year-old bastard.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.669

Keep the dog.

Ed? Just kiddin'. How you doin'?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.215
Good. You ready to
watch the game?

29:11.216 --> 29:15.119
Actually, no. I'm a little bit sleepy.
I'm tired, I'm exhausted--

29:15.120 --> 29:17.421
What are you talkin' about being sleepy?
Five minutes to tip-off.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.690
It's time for rocket ball!

29:19.691 --> 29:22.059
<i>Ray, where do you keep
the glasses?</i>

29:22.060 --> 29:27.732
Oh, shari's here. Why didn't

Who's that?

29:36.108 --> 29:38.009
Okay. Oh, god, oh, god.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.711
Want me to get that? No, I got it.
Ed, don't go, I--

29:40.712 --> 29:44.115
Whoa, whoa! Look at that!
Get in on that!

29:44.116 --> 29:46.317
Oh, man!

29:46.318 --> 29:49.020
<i>I'm being misled by a manipulating
medium called television.</i>

29:49.021 --> 29:53.424
- Let's get out.
- No, she's a homeless girl. Ed, don't leave.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.559
She was out on the street,
so I--

29:55.560 --> 29:59.999
She didn't have any clothes or a place
to stay, and I-- honey? Oh, shit! Ed?

30:00.000 --> 30:00.531
She didn't have any clothes or a place
to stay, and I-- honey? Oh, shit! Ed?

30:00.532 --> 30:03.701
What do you mean homeless? My
place is better than this dump.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.536
Dump?

30:05.537 --> 30:09.106
What? That was shari on the phone.
She saw the whole thing on TV.

30:09.107 --> 30:13.244
I gotta tell ya, she's pissed.
No shit, ray. Who's the girl?

30:13.245 --> 30:17.281
The--
<i>Come here a second.</i>

30:17.282 --> 30:20.284
<i>She's the receptionist at the place
where I buy all that gym equipment.</i>

30:20.285 --> 30:24.155
And she's a real knockout and a redhead
to boot, which I've never had.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.290
And she's never given me
the time of day.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.999
Suddenly, today she's all, "hey, I
saw you on TV, and you were great."

30:30.000 --> 30:30.195
Suddenly, today she's all, "hey, I
saw you on TV, and you were great."

30:30.196 --> 30:34.565
And I'm all, "you know, I just made some
ginger root gazpacho. Come on over."

30:34.566 --> 30:36.701
The next thing you know,
ba-da-bing!

30:36.702 --> 30:40.104
I mean, I'm human. What do you mean?
Why didn't you stop?

30:40.105 --> 30:41.572
Stop?

30:41.573 --> 30:45.443
Why didn't you stop? I'm the guy.
I don't stop!

30:45.444 --> 30:48.413
That's the woman's job. We're the gas.
They're the brakes.

30:51.316 --> 30:56.354
<i>Go talk to shari. Honey, let him
come talk to you. Why? Why me?</i>

30:56.355 --> 30:59.999
Because you brought the cameras here.
You brought the girl.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.359
Because you brought the cameras here.
You brought the girl.

31:00.360 --> 31:06.030
Oh! Is that the way it is? You can't do
me that one little, simple favor? Great.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.432
Okay, I don't need
any favors from you!

31:08.433 --> 31:11.136
Matter of fact,
p.S., go to hell!

31:14.172 --> 31:16.307
Friggin' out of his gourd, man.

31:16.308 --> 31:20.144
Ed, man, come on, you know I
really need this. I need this!

31:20.145 --> 31:22.313
If I go over there, you know
they're coming with me.

31:22.314 --> 31:26.450
If I go over, she's gonna put my balls
in a blender. You know you would, honey.

31:26.451 --> 31:29.999
All I'm askin' is just go talk to her
and beg her. Beg her if you have--

31:30.000 --> 31:30.422
All I'm askin' is just go talk to her
and beg her. Beg her if you have--

31:30.423 --> 31:36.227
Actually, honey, just let him come beg you.
And you owe me.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.129
I owe you? You know you owe me.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.297
<i>I owe you. I owe you?
You owe me.</i>

31:40.298 --> 31:43.334
Yes, go! Come--

31:43.335 --> 31:47.471
I can't go on about this.
"I owe you, you owe me."

31:47.472 --> 31:52.476
Look, I have a guest. I'm bein'
rude, all right? I'll talk to you.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.312
Thanks, honey. Okay.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.487
Yeah, yeah, Phil,
are you watchin' this?

32:03.488 --> 32:06.624
<i>- Friggin' out of his gourd.</i>
- You might wanna take a look.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.460
Jack, let's go. We're gonna be late.
Shush.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.564
Don't shush me. Oh, shush.
Shush! Shush!

32:17.068 --> 32:19.403
Hi!

32:19.404 --> 32:22.239
Hi, I'm Rita.
I'm shari's roommate.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.241
Hey, Rita, I'm ed.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.678
- Shari knew you were coming over because she saw.
- The cameras, yeah.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.999
She really doesn't want you and
the cameras up here right now.

32:30.000 --> 32:30.714
She really doesn't want you and
the cameras up here right now.

32:30.715 --> 32:35.454
Right. Um, well, at least--
How is she doin'?

32:36.321 --> 32:38.189
I--

32:38.190 --> 32:40.524
I gave her a drink. I thought--

32:40.525 --> 32:43.461
But she's not much of a drinker,
so it's made her a little--

32:43.462 --> 32:46.297
What do you want? Belligerent.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.098
Hey, shari.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.601
Listen,
I'm real sorry about all this.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.237
Can I--
Can I come up?

32:53.238 --> 32:55.573
Come on, shari.

32:55.574 --> 32:59.999
I know it's real awkward with the cameras,
but let me come say two words, would ya?

33:00.000 --> 33:00.544
I know it's real awkward with the cameras,
but let me come say two words, would ya?

33:00.545 --> 33:03.147
Shari, come on, would ya?

33:03.148 --> 33:05.650
I'm gettin' really wet down here.
Can I come up?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.287
All right, here we go, Carlos.

33:10.288 --> 33:12.424
Just stay with him.
Stay with him.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.759
- Hang on, Mike.
<i>- Ken, am I set?</i>

33:15.760 --> 33:17.662
You're hard-wired, Mike.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.435
Hi. Hey.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.438
Thanks for lettin' me up. Sure.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.374
Hey, shari.

33:31.309 --> 33:34.044
<i>I'm gonna go to bed. Good night.
</i> Did I miss anything?

33:34.045 --> 33:36.280
Good night.

33:36.281 --> 33:37.582
Hi, mom.

33:44.689 --> 33:49.226
Ray feels-- - oh, don't
defend that horse's ass to me!

33:49.227 --> 33:53.030
I'm not. I'm not-- I'm not
defending him, shari. I--

33:53.031 --> 33:56.634
I'm just sayin',
maybe this is a good thing.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.303
He got it out of his system,
right?

33:59.304 --> 33:59.999
He knows it's not worth it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.438
He knows it's not worth it.

34:01.439 --> 34:05.709
<i>So one day if you two
decide to get married-- ha!</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:08.712
<i>I've got news for you.</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:13.150
<i>I never intended to marry him.</i>

34:13.150 --> 34:15.219
<i>Why?</i>

34:16.288 --> 34:18.156
Well, for one thing,

34:19.456 --> 34:21.493
he's a bad lay.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.199
<i>I mean bad!</i>

34:31.136 --> 34:32.603
Oh!

34:32.603 --> 34:35.039
You tell him, sister!
You tell him!

34:35.040 --> 34:38.676
Ah, you know, that's terrible.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.079
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

34:42.213 --> 34:44.415
<i>Hey, shari--</i>

34:44.416 --> 34:46.483
<i>You happy now, ray?</i>

34:46.484 --> 34:49.520
<i>Listen, I think you're pissed
off at him, and you're hurt.</i>

34:49.521 --> 34:52.089
And you're trying
to get back at ray.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.123
Don't you think?

34:54.125 --> 34:58.596
Yep, you're right. It's me.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.999
It's me! It's always me!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.600
It's me! It's always me!

35:03.234 --> 35:07.471
I-I-- I go out with
all different kinds of guys,

35:07.472 --> 35:10.674
and the same thing
keeps happening!

35:10.675 --> 35:12.710
Look. You know what?
See these magazines?

35:12.711 --> 35:16.581
I take these quizzes. "How
are you at relationships?"

35:20.085 --> 35:24.388
I cheat, okay? I look in
the back for the answers.

35:24.389 --> 35:27.591
<i>I mean, Rita says men suck
and they should all die.</i>

35:27.592 --> 35:29.999
<i>Then she eats a pound cake. She's
crazy, but she's not confused.</i>

35:30.000 --> 35:32.520
<i>Then she eats a pound cake. She's
crazy, but she's not confused.</i>

35:36.001 --> 35:38.669
Me, I examine
every little thing.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.539
You know? I'm just like this.

35:44.009 --> 35:46.377
<i>- Shari.
- What?</i>

35:46.378 --> 35:51.282
You're way too terrific of a person to
be doin' this to yourself. You are.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.621
I mean, hey, I've told ray
a couple of times...

35:57.622 --> 35:59.999
I think you are one
of the best and smartest...

36:00.000 --> 36:02.026
I think you are one
of the best and smartest...

36:02.027 --> 36:05.062
And most attractive women
that I have ever met.

36:05.063 --> 36:07.165
I mean that.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.039
Really? Yeah, really.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.207
<i>I mean,</i>

36:17.208 --> 36:21.112
<i>there is nothin' wrong with you.</i>

36:22.414 --> 36:24.149
Uh-oh.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.459
Kiss him. Kiss him!

36:35.460 --> 36:37.429
Don't do it, ed.

36:40.098 --> 36:42.067
Don't you kiss her.
Don't you kiss her.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.440
God!

36:49.708 --> 36:52.976
I'm nuts, huh? Hah! I told him.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.611
Yes! Yes, I win!

36:54.612 --> 36:58.750
Oh, Whitaker, you schmuck, I am
the golden goddess of television!

37:07.459 --> 37:10.028
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

37:14.532 --> 37:17.702
Yes, yes, you're on television.
You're on television!

37:18.603 --> 37:21.004
Oh, my god.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.675
Oh, god.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.710
Oh, wow.

37:26.711 --> 37:29.613
Listen, shari? It's okay.

37:29.614 --> 37:30.000
I just kissed my boyfriend's brother
on television! How is that okay?

37:30.001 --> 37:33.650
I just kissed my boyfriend's brother
on television! How is that okay?

37:33.651 --> 37:36.120
When you put it that way,
no, it's not ideal.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.122
Please go. Go! Let's talk.

37:38.123 --> 37:41.325
All right. We're outta here, guys.
Come on, she's right.

37:41.326 --> 37:45.129
Son of a bitch.
What the hell just happened?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.530
Hey, hey!

37:46.531 --> 37:50.702
- Come on, ed! You can't do this to me!
- We're locked out!

37:58.042 --> 37:59.999
No, Carlos, you're killing me! Just shoot
the door. I got Mike up on the roof.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.745
No, Carlos, you're killing me! Just shoot
the door. I got Mike up on the roof.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.715
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

38:06.384 --> 38:08.653
What are we doing?

38:10.655 --> 38:14.526
I've got to tell you
something, shari. What?

38:15.727 --> 38:18.562
I've had a big thing for
you for months. Really?

38:18.563 --> 38:22.699
I've been seeing you going out with
ray and you bein' his girlfriend,

38:22.700 --> 38:25.569
and the whole time I was wishing
you were <i>my</i> girlfriend.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.105
See, me too!

38:28.106 --> 38:29.999
I am going out with ray, and
all I can think about is you.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.678
I am going out with ray, and
all I can think about is you.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.521
I treated you like a princess!

38:44.522 --> 38:47.991
<i>This is so weird.
Yeah, it is weird.</i>

38:47.992 --> 38:49.527
<i>Okay.</i>

38:52.463 --> 38:54.299
Oh, I gotta go.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.419
<i>¿Uno más?</i>

39:33.705 --> 39:36.173
Ray? Oh, hey, al. You seen ray?

39:36.174 --> 39:37.207
Is he around?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.643
- Hey! I'm on television!
- Yeah.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.512
Ray was here, but he left when
he saw you were comin' over.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.215
Shit. That was some night
last night, huh, kiddo?

39:45.216 --> 39:48.252
Yeah, it damn sure was, al.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.287
All right, how about mom?
Is she around?

39:50.288 --> 39:54.591
She's here in the bedroom. I'd
yell for her, but I'd die.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.094
Don't do that. Mom!

39:57.095 --> 39:59.999
I'm right here, darlin'. No need to shout.
That's not how you were brought up.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.766
I'm right here, darlin'. No need to shout.
That's not how you were brought up.

40:02.767 --> 40:05.402
Mom, what are you doin'?

40:05.403 --> 40:09.072
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to my home.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.275
- Blanche Dubois lives.
<i>- Mom. Mom.</i>

40:11.276 --> 40:15.178
<i>I'm looking for ray. I've been calling him.
He won't call me back.</i>

40:15.179 --> 40:17.714
How could you do something like that?
Your own brother's girlfriend.

40:17.715 --> 40:20.250
It's not all my fault.
He cheated on her.

40:20.251 --> 40:24.655
<i>It was a mistake. Yes, it was a mistake.
Do you know where he is?</i>

40:24.656 --> 40:27.591
No. Maybe he's watching.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.999
Tell him you're sorry. Tell him that
you will stay away from that girl.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.661
Tell him you're sorry. Tell him that
you will stay away from that girl.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.730
No, ma! And that girl
has a name, okay?

40:33.731 --> 40:37.467
What, do you love her
or something?

40:37.468 --> 40:39.970
- Come on, al.
- Look at that red face.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.972
I had a car that color. A buick!

40:41.973 --> 40:43.573
Aren't you excited?

40:43.574 --> 40:47.010
He practically said he loved
you on television! I know.

40:47.011 --> 40:50.348
<i>Hi, girls. Hi.</i>

40:54.085 --> 40:56.586
<i>Oh, look at the little girls.</i>

40:56.587 --> 40:59.156
<i>Take my picture.
Here, take my picture.</i>

40:59.157 --> 40:59.999
<i>I gotta go to work.</i>

41:00.000 --> 41:01.258
<i>I gotta go to work.</i>

41:01.259 --> 41:03.560
<i>I gotta go to work.
You understand that?</i>

41:03.561 --> 41:08.732
I am really gonna get hurt
this time.

41:08.733 --> 41:12.569
<i>Here we go, girls.
I'm goin' to work. Bye.</i>

41:12.570 --> 41:15.706
Yeah, doc,
I stopped payment on the plugs.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.675
You gave me doll hair!

41:18.676 --> 41:20.244
I'll hold.

41:24.282 --> 41:27.150
Okay, now I'll tell you
something else. Yeah.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.999
The old guy in the wheelchair,
the stepfather? Yeah.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.355
The old guy in the wheelchair,
the stepfather? Yeah.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.058
They're gonna have him die.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.495
That was Whitaker on the phone.

41:38.496 --> 41:43.167
I'm gonna have to scrub my ass because
he's on his way over to kiss it.

41:44.402 --> 41:47.372
Hey, bring it on in, buddy.
Bring it on in.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.441
That's right. Come on.

41:51.542 --> 41:55.146
A little further up. Come on.
All right, perfect, man.

41:56.447 --> 41:59.583
I got my own parking spot now?
It's all for you, ed.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.000
How's it going, man? Good, Marcus.
How are you?

42:00.001 --> 42:02.719
How's it going, man? Good, Marcus.
How are you?

42:02.720 --> 42:06.123
Thanks, man.
Ed, you're the best, man.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.025
Hi, mom. Saw you last night.
Lookin' good, man.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.493
Hey, ed.

42:09.494 --> 42:13.196
Oh, ray! Man, I've been
lookin' all over for you.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.166
Listen, man, I know I got
some explaining to do.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.668
Just let me do
what I came here to do.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.571
What, do you want to fight?

42:22.673 --> 42:25.542
Cassie. Cassie, come on.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.245
This is really hard.
You promised.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.999
What are--
What are you doing, ray?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.014
What are--
What are you doing, ray?

42:31.015 --> 42:32.483
Go ahead.

42:33.618 --> 42:37.287
I went out with ray
a few years ago...

42:37.288 --> 42:39.222
For a couple of months,

42:39.223 --> 42:41.492
and we were intimate.

42:43.161 --> 42:48.432
An.. He's really not as bad
as that girl said he was.

42:48.433 --> 42:51.635
I mean, I've definitely had worse.
That enough.

42:51.636 --> 42:54.671
I think we did
what we came here for.

42:54.672 --> 42:58.208
- Good-bye, brother.
- No, no, come on, ray!

42:58.209 --> 42:59.999
- Vindicated!
- Whoo! Yeah!

43:00.000 --> 43:01.211
- Vindicated!
- Whoo! Yeah!

43:01.212 --> 43:03.480
Ray, what are you--

43:03.481 --> 43:05.415
<i>I'm in the bathroom. Go ahead.</i>

43:05.416 --> 43:07.584
Sorry we're calling so late.

43:07.585 --> 43:11.655
This is the only time we get to talk to you
off camera. <i>It's cool, Cynthia. I was up.</i>

43:11.656 --> 43:14.157
Ed, why didn't you go
see shari today, man?

43:14.158 --> 43:18.195
That's what everybody was hoping you'd do.
<i>I wanted to, but I--</i>

43:18.196 --> 43:22.666
Is it about ray? Because ray is not
a problem. He cheated on shari.

43:22.667 --> 43:26.436
That's right, ed. Viewers don't like ray.
The research says females--

43:26.437 --> 43:29.999
No, hey, guys,
it's not ray. Okay?

43:30.000 --> 43:30.108
No, hey, guys,
it's not ray. Okay?

43:30.109 --> 43:33.510
<i>Hey, Cynthia?</i> Yes, ed?

43:33.511 --> 43:36.713
<i>Do you got a second? Can I talk
to you alone for a second?</i>

43:36.714 --> 43:41.084
Absolutely, yeah. Why don't you guys
take off? I'll see you in the morning.

43:41.085 --> 43:44.221
Okay, see you later. All
right, I'll see you later.

43:44.222 --> 43:47.125
Good-bye. All right.
See you later.

43:48.526 --> 43:50.560
Ed, how's it goin'?

43:50.561 --> 43:55.599
I'm good, you know. I'm-- I'm good.
Everything's-- everything's cool.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.568
Did you decide you don't
really like shari that much?

43:58.569 --> 43:59.999
No! N-n-n-no!
Listen, that's not it at all.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.139
No! N-n-n-no!
Listen, that's not it at all.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.976
<i>I like shari plenty.
Shari is-- oh, man.</i>

44:05.977 --> 44:09.147
<i>Shari's great.</i> Yeah?

44:11.549 --> 44:14.317
Lookit, Cynthia,
how's this gonna work?

44:14.318 --> 44:17.587
What, are we gonna date on TV?
She's not gonna like that.

44:17.588 --> 44:22.492
If you don't call her, you're not
really giving her a choice. <i>-Okay.</i>

44:22.493 --> 44:24.661
- Ed?
- What?

44:24.662 --> 44:29.366
Can I give you some
advice about women? <i>Sure.</i>

44:29.367 --> 44:29.999
Women want to be pursued.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.670
Women want to be pursued.

44:33.704 --> 44:35.205
Yes, but--

44:35.206 --> 44:37.175
<i>Ed?</i> Huh?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.677
What would Burt do?

44:53.991 --> 44:58.228
This is so exciting. A real
celebrity delivering my figs.

44:58.229 --> 44:59.999
Yeah. Okay, if you would
just sign right here, please.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.097
Yeah. Okay, if you would
just sign right here, please.

45:01.098 --> 45:05.402
Ray's a pig. That ed is a doll.
Latch onto him, honey.

45:05.403 --> 45:08.038
Okay. Just sign right there
in the black area, please.

45:08.039 --> 45:12.609
It wouldn't kill you to use more makeup
on television. You look washed out.

45:12.610 --> 45:16.012
What would I actually have to do
to get you to sign this? Uh-huh.

45:16.013 --> 45:19.617
On television a minute, and
already you got an attitude.

45:21.285 --> 45:22.753
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

45:26.023 --> 45:27.425
Hi.

45:29.193 --> 45:29.999
What are you doing?
I missed you.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.761
What are you doing?
I missed you.

45:31.762 --> 45:33.764
Really?

45:34.765 --> 45:36.467
I--

45:42.406 --> 45:45.242
Wow. I've never seen you
in uniform before.

45:45.243 --> 45:47.143
Yeah, well--

45:47.144 --> 45:51.014
It's really quite a turnoff.

45:51.015 --> 45:52.617
Thank you.

45:53.718 --> 45:56.553
Listen, Sunday night
at the sharks game,

45:56.554 --> 45:58.755
I'm gonna be driving
the zamboni.

45:58.756 --> 45:59.999
The what? That big machine
that cleans the ice, you know?

46:00.000 --> 46:01.391
The what? That big machine
that cleans the ice, you know?

46:01.392 --> 46:03.527
It's quite an honor.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.464
Will you go with me?

46:13.738 --> 46:16.339
See, look, I know
this is weird, shari,

46:16.340 --> 46:18.642
but--

46:18.643 --> 46:22.245
I don't want to wait. I don't.

46:22.246 --> 46:25.249
I really think we might
have something here.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.252
Don't you?

46:34.659 --> 46:37.995
Oh, these are for you.
Thank you.

46:40.164 --> 46:42.165
So will you be my zamboni date?

46:42.166 --> 46:44.335
Huh?

46:45.236 --> 46:47.672
Yes. All right.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.542
Yes!

46:53.210 --> 46:58.148
Cynthia, this is great. This is
exploitable! This is perfect.

46:58.149 --> 46:59.999
Yeah, well.

47:00.000 --> 47:00.500

58:11.455 --> 58:15.292
<i>Ed pekurny! We'll be
right back after this.</i>

58:18.161 --> 58:21.197
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Hey,
can I have another hat for my dad?

58:21.198 --> 58:23.566
Ed, I got your car ready right here.
Cool.

58:23.567 --> 58:26.669
Can you get us sodas for the ride to
the airport? Yeah. Coke or Pepsi?

58:26.670 --> 58:29.999
Uh, Pepsi. Can I talk to
you for a second, man?

58:30.000 --> 58:30.040
Uh, Pepsi. Can I talk to
you for a second, man?

58:30.041 --> 58:32.475
Yeah. What's up?
My name is Shane.

58:32.476 --> 58:35.411
Hey, Shane. How you doin'? What's
this, man? This is a tape of my band.

58:35.412 --> 58:39.682
I thought maybe you could
play it on your show.

58:39.683 --> 58:42.986
Oh, man, come on. One
of the guys is blind.

58:45.122 --> 58:48.324
All right,
I'll give it a listen.

58:48.325 --> 58:51.027
The name of the band is
"not all of us can see."

58:51.028 --> 58:53.029
Really terrific name.
"Not all of us can see."

58:53.030 --> 58:56.465
"Not all of you can see."
What the hell is that?

58:56.466 --> 58:59.999
For the love of
sweet Jesus Christ.

59:00.000 --> 59:00.703
For the love of
sweet Jesus Christ.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.305
Really.

59:08.345 --> 59:10.246
Hi. Hi.

59:10.247 --> 59:13.349
Um, I wanted to say
I really love your show.

59:13.350 --> 59:15.418
I think you're great.
Oh, wow. Thank you.

59:15.419 --> 59:18.254
That's a really cool thing
to say. I'm ed.

59:18.255 --> 59:20.724
And you must be... John?

59:22.359 --> 59:25.161

59:25.162 --> 59:29.999
Oh, yes. Well, I'm Jill. I'm
from San Francisco too.

59:30.000 --> 59:30.033
Oh, yes. Well, I'm Jill. I'm
from San Francisco too.

59:30.034 --> 59:34.404
Right. The bay area, yeah?
I can tell by the accent.

59:37.507 --> 59:40.609
Ta, ta, ta, ta. Ya, ya, ya.

59:40.610 --> 59:44.080
Ya, ya, ya. Uh,

59:44.081 --> 59:46.182
So, wh-- what are you
doing here?

59:46.183 --> 59:49.585
I just flew down
to audition for a skit.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.354
<i>All right.</i>

59:52.355 --> 59:56.258
<i>I'm a model and sort of
an actress, so, um--</i>

<i>Um, oh-- so really,
it was nice meeting you.</i>

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.633
Oh, yeah. No, you too.
Um-- yeah.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:09.238
They were supposed to send a car to
take me to the airport, but, um--

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.607
<i>I'll tell you what. We gotta--</i>

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.343
We're going to the airport right now.
We got a limo outside.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.378
Why don't you just ride with us?

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:18.981
Oh. Yeah. That'd be great.

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:21.217
Thanks. You're welcome.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:24.020

Hey, ed, this guy
says he knows you.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.538
Hey. Hey.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:18.375
How you doin'?

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.714
You don't recognize me?

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.349
Dad?

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.999
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.500
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.458
Did you do this? Did you find
him and tell him-- no. No way.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.228
Hey, come on--
Come on in.

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.497
Well, yeah, okay.

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.132
- Goddamn.
<i>- Everybody, this is Hank.</i>

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:47.136
<i>He's, uh, my dad.</i> Oh, this just
keeps getting better, doesn't it?

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:50.706
What you're sayin', ma, is that everything
he told me yesterday was a lie.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.510
Yes... practically.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.414
What do you mean,
"practically," ma?

01:01:58.415 --> 01:01:59.999
Either you threw him out or he ran away.
Which one is it?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.350
Either you threw him out or he ran away.
Which one is it?

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.285
I need to replace the coil.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:06.021
He ran away
after I threw him out.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:08.691
How much is one of those new coils?
150 bucks.

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:11.193
So he was telling the truth.
Should I go ahead?

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:14.196
- Yes.
- Yes to me, or yes to the coil, mom?

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:17.399
Both. Oh, shit.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.368
Eddie, look, he had girlfriends.

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.303
He told me he had this one girl.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:25.207
I don't care what he told you. I really do not
need to relive this on national television.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.476
- I am your mother.
- Yes, you are my mother.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.999
You do not have to humiliate me like this!
I'm not trying to humiliate you.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.146
You do not have to humiliate me like this!
I'm not trying to humiliate you.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:32.514
I don't need this! Go away!

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.049
Eddie?

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.418
Make this one out
to Dr. rumpley.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.221
Maybe the son of a bitch won't
keep me waiting for an hour.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.590
Damn urologists think
they run the world.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.560
She does this every time.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:48.130
- All right, do you want to know the truth?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:52.501
I took you, ray and marcia to my
sister's on the train for the weekend.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:56.672
You all came down with chicken pox,
so I took you home a day early.

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:59.999
And I walked in,
and there was your father...

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.277
And I walked in,
and there was your father...

01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:03.078
With another woman
in our bed, okay?

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:06.682
Chicken pox. Ma, I was six
when I had chicken pox.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:09.752
And dad didn't leave
until I was 12.

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:13.188
- Well, he apologized.
- - <i>what do you mean, he apologized, mom?</i>

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:16.659
<i>He begged me. He got down on
his knees and he begged me.</i>

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.561
<i>But, mom, you told me
that you had a hysterectomy...</i>

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:22.165
<i>And that he ran off
with your nurse.</i>

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.267
She could've been a nurse.

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:28.437
- What do you mean, could've been a nurse?
- She had white shoes.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.999
So does grandma!
So does Shaquille O'neal!

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.108
So does grandma!
So does Shaquille O'neal!

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.277
- That's good.
<i>- What's the difference?</i>

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.414
Mom, the difference is that for 20
years I've been thinking one thing,

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:41.550
and now it's turned out
to be a whole different thing!

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.352
Eddie.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:46.622
He was no good to me. Don't
you remember the way it was?

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:50.059
Don't you remember the way
he used to scream at me?

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.695
And then no job was ever
good enough for him.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:56.633
"Small potatoes." Small potatoes!
You remember, al?

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:01.671
Al?

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:09.578
Mom,

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:13.717
you told me you didn't know al
until after dad left.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:19.756
Holy shit.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.027
You and al were--

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:29.365
And that's why you threw dad out.
There it is!

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:29.999
Finally the truth after
20 goddamn years, mom?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.434
Finally the truth after
20 goddamn years, mom?

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:35.304
He had another woman
in my bed, Eddie!

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:38.707
And how dare you call him
"dad" in front of al.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.342
Al is your father.

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:43.445
This is the one who was there for
you when you really needed someone.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:47.049
Ow! You're hurting me.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.151
Oh, Jeanette.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:51.354
Oh, mom.

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:56.226
Don't blame your mother.
I was irresistible.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.205
Well, come on in.

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.307
How are you doin'?

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:15.711
All right. All right. Well--

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:19.482
You? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm-- I'm doing fine.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:23.185
<i>I guess you came up here...</i>

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:25.355
To check on
your inheritance, did ya?

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.999
Come right over here.
You sit right down there.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.527
Come right over here.
You sit right down there.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.395
There you go.

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:35.331
Thank you. Yeah.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:40.737
This is, uh, quite
a shithole, ain't it?

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.974
Well, it could be...
If you fixed it up.

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:50.179
Jeanette, you better take
a look at this. Coming.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.014
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:56.285
<i>You know, it is really nice
of you to come up here.</i>

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.999
<i>A million times I wanted to
see you kids, but, uh, well--</i>

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:00.290
<i>A million times I wanted to
see you kids, but, uh, well--</i>

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:04.593
<i>I mean, your mom,
she told me to stay away.</i>

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.497
<i>And I had to respect her wishes.</i>

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:13.169
Can I ask you somethin'?
Anything.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.275
What happened, pop? I mean--

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.745
How'd you end up like this?

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.148
You know, life is funny.
That's all.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.084
I can't tell you
how many times if...

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:29.999
Just one little thing that I
needed would've happened,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.020
just one little thing that I
needed would've happened,

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.555
why, everything
would've changed,

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.424
I'll tell you that.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:38.227
But I don't make excuses.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.028
And I don't hold grudges.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.699
You and me, we had some good
times together, didn't we? Huh?

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:49.638
Remember the time we drove down
to Houston for the weekend,

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:52.374
<i>and we saw the astros
and the Dodgers play?</i>

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.677
We stayed in a motel.
It was just you and me.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.114
You hopped from bed to bed.

01:06:59.115 --> 01:06:59.999
Hell, I remember that
just like it was yesterday.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.417
Hell, I remember that
just like it was yesterday.

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:06.422
I remember everything you
said and everything you did.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.426
- That was ray, pop.
- Hmm?

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.630
<i>You took ray to Houston.
That wasn't me.</i>

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:17.333
<i>I had to stay home...
With mom and marcia.</i>

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.238
<i>That's right. Ray.</i>

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.507
Ray was the older one.

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:27.677
Still is.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.981
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:38.120
Well, isn't that something?

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.422
<i>Damn the mind!</i>

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.257
You know, I gotta go, pop.

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:46.095
I got a thing across town I gotta get to.
Sure, son, sure. Sure.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.135
You know what? All right.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.704
Listen up. This is my pop.
All right?

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:58.307
<i>If there's anybody out there
that can help him out--</i>

01:07:58.308 --> 01:07:59.999
<i>Get him a job or something--</i>

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.609
<i>Get him a job or something--</i>

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.277
<i>I drove a limo for a while.</i>

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:05.113
I'll help you out. I'll mention
your business on the air--

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.982
I don't have a valid
license right now.

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:10.353
<i>We'll figure something out,
all right?</i>

- She really scored.

What are we cocking around here for?
Cynthia, do something.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.318

01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:17.519
I don't understand it.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.021
Remember when you were
interviewin' me...

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:22.324
And you asked me
if I had a dream?

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:26.428
And I said, "sure, I got a dream. I
just don't know what it is yet."

01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:29.999
Yeah. Yeah, great line.
Try to work that into the show.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.136
Wh-- what if shari's the dream?

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:39.741
Oh, come on, ed. You're beating yourself
up for nothing. You knew her history.

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:44.145
When the going gets tough,
shari gets going...

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.714
As far away as possible.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:50.118
She's one of those, "I'll dump
you before you dump me" chicks.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:53.755
Yeah. But what if we could get ups to
tell us where they sent her, you know?

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:58.159
Then I could go visit her, and hell, we
could even move the show there for a while.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.999
Ed, if you want this thing

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.563
ed, if you want this thing
to work with her,

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:06.434

now is to give her some space.

They hit a little rough spot, started seeing
other people. They got back together.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:47.309

child, for what it's worth.

You know, common sense.</i>

<i>You know?</i>

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:41.328

<i>But al is your husband now.</i>

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:46.100

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:07.521

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.463
<i>That everybody's got a
skeleton in their closet?</i>

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.099
<i>But how many skeletons
can one family have?</i>

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.435
<i>No, I think the country's saying
we've had enough of this.</i>

01:32:21.436 --> 01:32:24.406
<i>Let's get back to the way
TV used to be.</i>

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:49.197
We are gathered today--

01:32:59.240 --> 01:32:59.999
How ya doin', boy?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.476
How ya doin', boy?

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:07.481
How was the service?
It was all right.

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:09.650
His parole officer said
some lovely words,

01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:14.089
and once again I was
reminded the end is near.

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:17.291
Sorry you couldn't
come in, kiddo,

01:33:17.292 --> 01:33:22.730
but for some reason, the family feels
they're not comin' off so well on TV.

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:28.102
Well...

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:29.999
You and mom are gonna
work things out, aren't ya?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.271
You and mom are gonna
work things out, aren't ya?

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.973
I'm movin' out.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.309
No, al. What do you mean,
you're moving out?

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:37.111
I'm gonna be living
with my brother.

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:39.113
He's not in such
good shape as me,

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:41.549
but I'm looking forward
to the pillow fights.

01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:45.752
Hank.

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:48.322
Hank was always good
with the ladies.

01:33:48.323 --> 01:33:50.524
Always good-lookin'.

01:33:50.525 --> 01:33:54.195
Hell, he's been dead for two days,
he still looks better than me.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:57.132
I gotta tell you something, al.

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.036
You know, Hank, he--

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:11.312
You're my father, al.

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.507
<i>Take care of yourself, huh?</i>

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:42.510
<i>You know I will.</i>

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:55.156
I guess it's when... You
know the head, it's, uh,

01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:57.659
different.

01:35:02.597 --> 01:35:05.032
<i>You have done it! I've had it!</i>

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.167
<i>Hey, Crockett. Ease up, man.</i>

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:10.170
<i>Ease up? He just devoured my
entire buddy holly collection!</i>

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:12.339
<i>What is it with you?</i>

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:16.476
<i>How would you like it if somebody
chewed up your personal belongings?</i>

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:19.046
<i>See this blanket? You see this?</i>

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:21.767
<i>Elvis loves this blanket. It's his
most favorite thing in the whole--</i>

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.999
- Three more months?
<i>- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:30.091
- Three more months?
<i>- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

01:35:30.092 --> 01:35:34.361
Ed TV's <i>more popular than ever. The
resurgence in interest is astounding.</i>

01:35:34.362 --> 01:35:37.364
Of course, this means another
big bonus payment for you.

01:35:37.365 --> 01:35:39.601
Yea! Whoo-hoo!

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:44.071
Ed, have you thought about
moving in with your mother?

01:35:44.072 --> 01:35:48.476
I mean, she's all alone now. I'm
sure she could use your support.

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:59.621
You know, we're not as dumb
as you people think we are.

01:36:08.296 --> 01:36:11.266
I'm takin' what little
dignity there is left,

01:36:13.034 --> 01:36:15.103
and I quit.

01:36:17.205 --> 01:36:20.507
Yeah. Can somebody
validate my parking?

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:23.343
Ed, I'm afraid that--
That's not possible.

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:26.113
Okay, Mr. big network. I'll
pay for it myself. No.

01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:28.116
I mean, you can't quit.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.999
The hell I can't.
Lookit, I just did.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.019
The hell I can't.
Lookit, I just did.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:35.422
I know, ed, but, you see,

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:38.392
you agreed to stay on the air
as long as we asked you to.

01:36:38.393 --> 01:36:41.428
The station entered into this
with that understanding.

01:36:41.429 --> 01:36:45.432
Now, if you had refused
up front,

01:36:45.433 --> 01:36:48.169
well, we would have done
this with somebody else.

01:36:49.604 --> 01:36:53.173
You can't just change the rules
in the middle of the game, son.

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.441
It's just not fair.

01:36:54.442 --> 01:36:57.711
Listen, if you don't
let me out of this now,

01:36:57.712 --> 01:36:59.999
I-I-I'm gonna go home,
stick my thumb up my butt,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.548
I-I-I'm gonna go home,
stick my thumb up my butt,

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.284
sit on my ass
and not do a damn thing.

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:06.553
I won't go anywhere.

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:09.589
What kind of show does that sound like?
Uh, not too good.

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.191
No, not too good.

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:14.661
That's why it states very
specifically in your contract...

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:18.365
That if you don't continue
to live a normal life,

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:22.436
well, then,
you're in breach, see?

01:37:22.437 --> 01:37:27.408
And you're liable for <i>all</i> the
station's financial losses.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.510
I'll get this.

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:18.359
Autograph, please?

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:55.663

Just give it to me.

Everyone knows why, ed.
I told you why.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:30.251
Everyone knows why, ed.
I told you why.

01:41:30.252 --> 01:41:34.254
No, you said it was because of the
TV, but I don't believe that.

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.122
I mean, l-look at us.

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:40.160
We've been with people before,
and it didn't work out.

01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:43.663
And none of it was on TV, shari.

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:45.266
None of it.

01:41:47.335 --> 01:41:50.270
You and me,

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:52.439
we've been burned.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.409
And we're scared.

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:59.280
That's why you left.

01:42:01.349 --> 01:42:03.718
And that's why...

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:08.055
I didn't do a damn thing

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:16.130
Shari?

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.208

01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:04.111

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:34.574
All right, listen.
You stay here.

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:37.077
I'm leaving. These guys
are coming with me.

01:43:37.078 --> 01:43:40.346
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I'm gonna
figure something out so we can be together.

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.749
Okay? Okay.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.161
Let's go, guys.

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:57.631
No, Mike. Follow shari.

<i>Mike, shecky, come on.</i>

01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:01.102
<i>Mike, shecky, come on.</i>

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:07.141
Mike, shecky, I'm leaving. You're
supposed to follow me. Let's go.

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:20.087
Give him room, people.
Give him room.

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:25.658
Hi, ed. Why the hell are
they still followin' shari?

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:29.095
It's their new concept. Since--

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:29.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:34.434
What's going on here?
Why is my family on TV?

01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:37.170
Like I was saying,
it's a new concept.

01:44:37.171 --> 01:44:40.173
Since shari and your family
all signed releases,

01:44:40.174 --> 01:44:43.009
we're allowed to follow them on camera
even though you're not with them.

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:47.647
So we go with whoever's the most exciting.
And right now, look.

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:52.519
See, it's you and--
Oh, me.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:55.321
- You can't do this.
- I'm not a lawyer.

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:58.124
I'm just a guy who eats
three meals a day in this truck.

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.999
We gotta get them off the air.
This is not part of the deal.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.161
We gotta get them off the air.
This is not part of the deal.

01:45:01.162 --> 01:45:04.164
I don't give a goddamn.
Make the call, man.

01:45:04.165 --> 01:45:06.699
Make the call. Get 'em off.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.701
Look, ed, this is--

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:12.138
I'll get 'em off. Hey, hey, hey!

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:16.209
Ed! Ed, come on!
Ed, if you break the truck--

01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:18.745
If you break the truck,
they'll charge you for it.

01:45:18.746 --> 01:45:20.547
<i>They'll have a new one here
in 15 minutes.</i>

01:45:20.548 --> 01:45:23.483
Ten.

01:45:23.484 --> 01:45:26.619
Come on, ed. This is crazy.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.999
Hey, hey. They got you, man.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.491
Hey, hey. They got you, man.

01:45:30.492 --> 01:45:33.127
Just... go home.

01:45:34.028 --> 01:45:35.496
Go home, gomer.

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.567
<i>Ed, this is crazy. Come on.</i>

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:53.614
You know what?

01:45:57.585 --> 01:45:59.153
They're right.

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:03.323
This is a great idea.

01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:06.192
My family is interesting.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:08.229
Hell, look at 'em.

01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:12.032
But everybody's interesting,
right?

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:18.338
I bet you that wacky little
group that owns this network...

01:46:18.339 --> 01:46:20.406
That I had the meeting with,

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:23.611
I bet they're pretty goddamn
interesting too, don't you think?

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:27.680
<i>Huh? I'll bet they are.</i>

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:29.999
<i>Yeah. I'll bet you...
$10,000 they are.</i>

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.286
<i>Yeah. I'll bet you...
$10,000 they are.</i>

01:46:35.356 --> 01:46:37.423
Yeah.

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:41.027
I oughta loosen up
a little bit, shouldn't I?

01:46:41.028 --> 01:46:43.096
Let's have a little fun
with this thing.

01:46:43.097 --> 01:46:47.967
Let's really blow it out. Let's--
Let's have-- let's have a contest.

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:50.470
Who can dig up...

01:46:50.471 --> 01:46:53.606
The most embarrassing and humiliating
information on any of the executives...

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:58.211
Of the northwest broadcast company,
which owns this station, true TV?

01:46:58.212 --> 01:46:59.999
<i>'Cause, after all,
why should anyone...</i>

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:00.980
<i>'Cause, after all,
why should anyone...</i>

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.082
<i>Have any privacy, right?</i>

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:05.351
So I want anything, anything...

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:08.254
From their past, their present,
business, personal, you name it.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.290
If it's dirty and it's
true, we want it.

01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.727
Whoever brings the sleaziest and
most degrading material to me,

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:17.297
I'm gonna pay you...

01:47:17.298 --> 01:47:20.066
$10,000.

01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:22.502
Yeah, Eddie! I love this guy!

01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:25.038
<i>And tonight at 9:00,
I'll announce...</i>

01:47:25.039 --> 01:47:27.173
<i>The big winner, all right?</i>

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:29.442
Now, you're gonna need
my home number.

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:29.999
All right? Call me any time.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.545
All right? Call me any time.

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:35.515
And if you get in right now,
I'm gonna throw in a bonus.

01:47:35.516 --> 01:47:38.184
You're gonna get a free book
by author ray pekurny...

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:41.387
Titled <i>my brother pissed on me.</i>

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:44.223
All right, America. Come on, baby.
Let's start diggin'.

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:47.527
This is ridiculous.
How can this be legal?

01:47:47.528 --> 01:47:49.295
It's defamation. It's slander.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:51.731
Not technically,
because he is not showing...

01:47:51.732 --> 01:47:54.067
A reckless disregard
for the truth.

01:47:54.068 --> 01:47:56.002
Oh, come on!
What are you saying?

01:47:56.003 --> 01:47:59.072
At 9:00 he can say whatever he wants
about us? That is ridiculous.

01:47:59.073 --> 01:47:59.999
There has got to be some way
we can shut this hillbilly up.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.674
There has got to be some way
we can shut this hillbilly up.

01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:04.477
- Hey, I've got an idea.
- What?

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:06.579
Let's not shut him up.

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:09.682
Let's get him to push it to Sunday
when the audience is bigger,

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.751
promote it
for the next five days,

01:48:11.752 --> 01:48:13.686
really hype it because
it's a ratings grabber,

01:48:13.687 --> 01:48:16.489
which is all that counts,
so run with it.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:19.192
You were right. I was wrong.

01:48:19.193 --> 01:48:21.694
See, <i>ed TV</i> is going
to be bigger than ever.

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:25.031
Cynthia, another word and you
may consider yourself fired.

01:48:25.032 --> 01:48:28.101
Uh-oh. Can you give me a hint?

01:48:28.102 --> 01:48:29.999
What word? Um, "asshole"?

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000
What word? Um, "asshole"?

01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:35.708
"Shithead"? I bet that--
Is that one word or two though?

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:38.344
I never can remember that.

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:40.279
"Shithead." Anyway, listen.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.051
It has been a real pleasure workin' for ya.
I have loved it.

01:48:45.052 --> 01:48:47.754
Loved it, loved it, loved it,
loved it, loved it, loved it.

01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:49.589
Loved it!

01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:54.060
So you're saying he didn't tip you?
Maybe you're not hot.

01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:56.329
Yeah. Uh--

01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:59.199
Look, I gotta go.
My brother's here.

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:13.213
Look, we gotta settle this.

01:49:18.352 --> 01:49:19.753
Well, all right, man.

01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:27.094
- They're gonna fight.
- Maybe they'll kill each other. That's at least an ending.

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:40.340
Okay, settled. Yeah, great.

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:44.177
Oh, that's it? What was that?

01:49:44.178 --> 01:49:48.748
Some kind of brotherly--
Southern brotherly thing.

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:52.118
Here you go. You weren't gonna swing,
were ya? Were you ready to swing?

01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:54.053
I was ready to throw down.

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:56.989
Hey, you know,
good thing I was here.

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:59.193
You got all kinds of calls.

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.533
This is not good.
This is not a good thing.

01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:09.403
Would 40 of these kill me?

01:50:12.139 --> 01:50:14.140
What if we compromised?

01:50:14.141 --> 01:50:18.344
Ask him to stay on two more
weeks, and then take him off.

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.546
Ah, phone.

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.116
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:50:23.584 --> 01:50:25.384
- Hello.
- Is this ed?

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.019
<i>Yes, it is. Who's this?</i>

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.999
I've got some information for you.
Better than anything you've got.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:30.390
I've got some information for you.
Better than anything you've got.

01:50:30.391 --> 01:50:32.125
Okay, I'm here. I'm here.

01:50:32.126 --> 01:50:36.729
I got this from one of the secretaries
that works at the network.

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:39.665
Got a little blitzed
at the Christmas party.

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:41.334
Listen carefully.

01:50:41.335 --> 01:50:43.402
I'm only gonna say this once...

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:46.473
'Cause talking this way
is really hurting my throat.

01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:50.010
Can anyone see
what he's writing?

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:55.548
"Duck"? Did anybody do
anything with a duck?

01:50:55.549 --> 01:50:59.018
Jesus! I'd hate to be stuck
in a foxhole with this group.

01:50:59.019 --> 01:50:59.999
- There's not a full-grown pair of testicles among you.
- Uh, sir, I--

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.655
- There's not a full-grown pair of testicles among you.
- Uh, sir, I--

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:06.425
Whatever little embarrassments
he comes up with, we'll spin it.

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:10.397
This guy is gonna stay on TV
until he dies.

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.233
Relax!

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:19.740
<i>Okay. Yes, I got it. Thank you.</i>

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:25.077
Well? I think we've
got a winner.

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:27.180
<i>- Uh, rayford?
- Ho!</i>

01:51:27.181 --> 01:51:29.715
<i>- Well, 9:00 yet?
- 9:01.</i>

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:30.000
<i>9:01. Got it. Okay.</i>

01:51:30.001 --> 01:51:32.685
<i>9:01. Got it. Okay.</i>

01:51:32.686 --> 01:51:36.355
<i>I don't know how many of you out there
are paying attention right now,</i>

01:51:36.356 --> 01:51:38.457
<i>but for those of you who are,</i>

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:40.593
<i>I think we just got the winner.</i>

01:51:40.594 --> 01:51:42.663
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:47.701
<i>How many of you know...</i>

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.705
What a penile implant is?

01:51:59.313 --> 01:51:59.999
<i>As it's explained to me, what
happens is you got One, two.</i>

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.982
<i>As it's explained to me, what
happens is you got One, two.</i>

01:52:02.983 --> 01:52:06.752
<i>And they are inserted
into the shaft.</i>

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:08.088
Oh!

01:52:09.356 --> 01:52:11.257
<i>Now, to get an erection,</i>

01:52:11.258 --> 01:52:12.758
<i>what this man does is...</i>

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.227
<i>He squeezes his pump,</i>

01:52:14.228 --> 01:52:16.262
<i>and it forces a fluid...</i>

01:52:16.263 --> 01:52:19.032
<i>That goes in the cylinders
into the shaft.</i>

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:23.570
Voilà, <i>you've got your stiffie.</i>

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:28.608
<i>You're good to go.
So, who's this lucky guy?</i>

01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:29.999
<i>I mean, who is this true TV executive who
can now get his Johnson to head north...</i>

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.511
<i>I mean, who is this true TV executive who
can now get his Johnson to head north...</i>

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:34.413
<i>Anytime he wants?</i>

01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:36.415
<i>I'm gonna tell you who the
lucky man is right now.</i>

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:38.452
- Tell us, brother!
<i>- All right then.</i>

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:41.420
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:43.624
<i>The man of the hour is Mr.--</i>

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:48.094
Whoo!

01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:51.030
<i>True TV regrets
to inform our audience...</i>

01:52:51.031 --> 01:52:53.399
<i>That due to circumstances
beyond our control--</i>

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.568
Ed TV <i>will no longer</i>
<i>be presented.</i>

01:52:55.569 --> 01:52:58.005
Whoo!

01:53:00.207 --> 01:53:02.708
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:06.980
Who's the guy with the phony-- -
what do they expect us to do now?

01:53:11.418 --> 01:53:14.654
Look, I don't know
who he was talkin' about.

01:53:14.655 --> 01:53:17.390
I don't even know
whether or not it was true.

01:53:17.391 --> 01:53:20.393
But he was about
to name one of you,

01:53:20.394 --> 01:53:25.298
and I'll be damned if I'll have one
of my people humiliated on public--

01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:29.402
I mean, not that there's anything to
be embarrassed about, if it's true.

01:53:29.403 --> 01:53:29.999
The point is,
it's a normal medical--

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.637
The point is,
it's a normal medical--

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:34.708
What the hell are you lookin'
at, you redheaded putz?

01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:41.515
Pack it up and go on home now.
Leave me in peace.

01:53:43.617 --> 01:53:44.984
Don't come back now, you hear?

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:47.687
Well...

01:53:47.688 --> 01:53:50.157
Back to infomercials.

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.093
Hey, I'm on TV! Look at me! Hi!

01:53:54.528 --> 01:53:57.364
Hi, mom!

01:54:02.703 --> 01:54:06.706
<i>So ed is no longer on TV.
Sam, how did he make out?</i>

01:54:06.707 --> 01:54:09.175
<i>Ed made out like a bandit.</i>

01:54:09.176 --> 01:54:12.178
<i>A spokesperson for true TV announced
that ed received a check...</i>

01:54:12.179 --> 01:54:14.413
<i>Covering his four months
on the air,</i>

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:17.550
<i>his balloon payment
and an additional bonus...</i>

01:54:17.551 --> 01:54:20.052
<i>To show the network's
appreciation...</i>

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:25.157
<i>For all his, quote, "hard
work and loyalty," unquote.</i>

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:29.061
<i>When asked exactly what happened,
a true TV spokesperson said...</i>

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:29.999
<i>They had no official comment,</i>

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.397
<i>they had no official comment,</i>

01:54:31.398 --> 01:54:34.501
<i>but that things
had been worked out.</i>

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.489
<i>Okay, let's do a final, uh--</i>

01:54:56.490 --> 01:54:59.091
<i>Perhaps say good-bye</i>
<i>here to</i> ed TV.

01:54:59.092 --> 01:54:59.999

01:55:02.162 --> 01:55:04.230

01:55:04.231 --> 01:55:06.632
