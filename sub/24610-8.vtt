WEBVTT

00:02.942 --> 00:04.152
Oh, for the...

00:04.220 --> 00:05.920
That's disgusting!

00:06.002 --> 00:08.496
Me? You're the one
that's covered in farts.

00:08.564 --> 00:10.629
And why couldn't you
put on some clothes

00:10.697 --> 00:12.197
before we left
the village?

00:12.275 --> 00:13.296
What, seriously?

00:13.363 --> 00:15.520
You think I'd be caught dead
dressed like a Nazi?

00:15.588 --> 00:17.246
Those old cannibal women

00:17.314 --> 00:19.775
had washed and folded
your regular clothes!

00:19.950 --> 00:21.684
Well, it's also hard
to go back

00:21.752 --> 00:23.762
after you taste
the freedom of the coconut.

00:23.846 --> 00:25.040
Master Coconut!

00:25.108 --> 00:26.332
Nobody gets that!

00:26.423 --> 00:27.689
You know what I don't get?

00:27.757 --> 00:29.559
The fact you're not
really a Goddess?

00:29.627 --> 00:30.994
I was gonna say
fractions.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.822
<i>I</i> was gonna say fractions!

00:32.890 --> 00:34.790
I don't get why
she's even with us.

00:34.893 --> 00:37.012
- I'm here because...
- Because I say so,

00:37.080 --> 00:38.916
so end of story!

00:39.222 --> 00:40.699
In return for which...

00:40.767 --> 00:43.340
I split
the idol with you 50-50.

00:43.408 --> 00:46.932
I... Wait, no,
I'd split it with you 50-50.

00:47.002 --> 00:48.017
It comes out the same.

00:48.095 --> 00:49.712
Yeah, but...
W-Wait, what?

00:49.780 --> 00:52.166
You, me, and the idol
makes three.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.302
What do you say?

00:53.370 --> 00:55.335
Wait, what are they saying?

00:55.405 --> 00:56.727
- Nothing.
- No,

00:56.795 --> 00:58.107
what are you
talking about?

00:58.174 --> 01:00.162
- Nothing!
- Okay! God!

01:00.230 --> 01:01.310
There are no Gods!

01:01.377 --> 01:03.131
Will you idiots hold it down?

01:03.246 --> 01:05.538
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

01:05.730 --> 01:07.360
Jesus, loud much?

01:07.428 --> 01:09.626
Are you trying to attract
apex predators?

01:09.694 --> 01:10.780
Oh, please.

01:10.848 --> 01:12.670
I just wiped out
a literal Goddamn boatload

01:12.738 --> 01:14.163
of Nazi stormtroopers.

01:14.269 --> 01:16.514
Doesn't get much more
apex than that.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.012
All right, Mr. Tough Guy,

01:23.080 --> 01:24.991
you don't have
to chuckle menacingly.

01:25.061 --> 01:26.133
What? I wasn't!

01:26.201 --> 01:27.733
Holy shit, look!

01:27.808 --> 01:29.217
There it is!

01:32.881 --> 01:35.624
Okay, so just so we're all
on the same page...

01:35.787 --> 01:38.405
we're walking into
an active volcano.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.124
Well, that's where
the idol is, so...

01:42.192 --> 01:44.420
I was double-checking,
Noah!

01:46.311 --> 01:48.483
I don't know why
you make me so furious.

01:48.631 --> 01:51.125
For me,
it's his face.

02:37.563 --> 02:39.307
Put your backs into it!

02:39.375 --> 02:41.409
If I put my back in
any more,

02:41.477 --> 02:43.580
it's gonna come gooshin'
out my front.

02:43.648 --> 02:46.315
<i>Oui, c'est impossible.</i>
I give up.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.159
- How French.
- You know...

02:48.226 --> 02:49.495
So, what,
we just sit here

02:49.563 --> 02:51.641
and wait for a clue
from a Goddamn thrush?

02:51.726 --> 02:53.125
Pff, thrushes.

02:53.193 --> 02:54.578
Uh, What are you
talking about?

02:54.646 --> 02:56.924
Like at the portal
of Erebor?

02:56.990 --> 02:58.016
Uh...

02:58.086 --> 02:59.916
Jesus, dummy,
in "The Hobbit"!

02:59.984 --> 03:01.237
- The what?
- Wait, what?

03:01.305 --> 03:02.846
- Seriously?
- Holy shit, that's right!

03:02.914 --> 03:04.815
He's been on this crummy island
four years,

03:04.883 --> 03:06.291
so he's never heard
of "The Hobbit."

03:06.359 --> 03:08.112
Which, as we all know,
was published

03:08.180 --> 03:10.760
just last year, in 1937!

03:10.828 --> 03:14.188
So what is it,
a motion picture or...

03:14.375 --> 03:15.448
Damn it, bird!

03:15.516 --> 03:17.398
- It's a book!
- It's <i> the</i> book!

03:17.526 --> 03:19.448
It's got dwarves.
It's got goblins.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.432
It's got wizards.
It's got, um...

03:21.500 --> 03:23.093
- Hobbits?
- Hobbits!

03:23.195 --> 03:24.502
Huh.
You guys don't really

03:24.570 --> 03:27.197
strike me as readers,
especially of fantasy.

03:27.299 --> 03:28.745
That's because
you're an asshole.

03:28.813 --> 03:30.495
Might I make
a suggestion?

03:30.563 --> 03:32.057
I know what you're
gonna say, Mother,

03:32.125 --> 03:33.557
but even if we had
enough people

03:33.625 --> 03:35.870
to act out the book,
we don't have time.

03:35.938 --> 03:37.620
Yeah,
it's long as shit.

03:37.688 --> 03:38.984
I don't see that
as a negative.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.659
I don't know,
all those songs?

03:40.727 --> 03:42.737
- Eh.
- Well, as stupid as this is,

03:42.805 --> 03:46.172
I was going to suggest
pulling on the door?

03:46.926 --> 03:48.539
God damn it.

03:53.219 --> 03:55.984
Lucky guess.
Okay, let's see here.

03:57.462 --> 03:59.094
Um...

04:03.129 --> 04:05.351
- Noah!
- Y-Yeah?

04:05.789 --> 04:07.438
You're on point, buddy.

04:10.672 --> 04:11.914
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

04:11.982 --> 04:13.713
Those damn fools
are going to lead me

04:13.781 --> 04:15.391
straight to the idol...

04:16.380 --> 04:18.789
And themselves
straight to hell!

04:27.727 --> 04:29.258
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

04:29.523 --> 04:31.242
It's pitch-black down there!

04:31.310 --> 04:33.510
Noah, if I have
to ask you again,

04:33.578 --> 04:35.165
it's gonna be
in the form of a shove.

04:35.266 --> 04:36.533
But...

04:36.874 --> 04:38.141
What the...

04:39.337 --> 04:41.109
No, no, no, no, no, no!

04:43.070 --> 04:45.148
Noah, go open the door.

04:45.216 --> 04:47.674
How? I can't even see
my hand in front of my face!

04:47.757 --> 04:49.234
Well,
then I guess you can't...

04:49.302 --> 04:50.502
See my fists

04:50.570 --> 04:52.727
swinging around
like a Goddamn windmill

04:52.836 --> 04:54.830
as I walk toward you, so...

04:54.898 --> 04:56.254
Ow!

04:56.321 --> 04:58.586
- Oh.
- God damn it!

04:58.875 --> 05:00.612
- Did I get you?
- What do you think?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.078
- Seriously?
- Moron.

05:02.161 --> 05:03.705
Oh, come on,
I was trying to hit Noah!

05:03.773 --> 05:05.284
For the love of God, will...

05:05.352 --> 05:06.893
- There is no...
- Ow!

05:06.961 --> 05:09.674
Now will someone...
open... the door?

05:09.742 --> 05:12.016
Okay, God!

05:16.945 --> 05:19.124
Ooh!

05:19.522 --> 05:21.538
I think the floor did that.

05:21.648 --> 05:24.271
Well, it should make this
a lot easier.

05:24.339 --> 05:26.306
What, a floor
that when you step on it,

05:26.374 --> 05:27.799
random shit happens?

05:27.867 --> 05:30.049
Yeah, so I guess everybody
watch your step.

05:30.117 --> 05:31.315
Uh, that's it?

05:31.383 --> 05:32.388
Um...

05:32.482 --> 05:34.343
watch your step and shut up?

05:35.208 --> 05:38.317
Oh, and I guess
try not to bunch up.

05:38.430 --> 05:41.599
<i>Sauf toi, Doudou.
Reste à côté de moi!</i>

05:42.435 --> 05:43.646
Doudou?

05:44.214 --> 05:45.716
- Doudou!
- Where'd he go?

05:45.784 --> 05:46.990
Oh, it's just like
the ponies.

05:47.058 --> 05:48.792
Ah, ho, hoh!
Oh, man.

05:48.860 --> 05:51.433
That's Hobbit
as balls!

05:55.152 --> 05:56.362
<i>We must go back!</i>

05:56.439 --> 05:57.951
<i>We cannot just leave Doudou!</i>

05:58.019 --> 05:59.443
<i>Well, not to split hairs,</i>

05:59.511 --> 06:01.308
<i>but he left us, so...</i>

06:01.410 --> 06:03.370
- Jesus Christ!
- Now what?

06:03.847 --> 06:05.427
Noah, what the shit
was that?

06:05.495 --> 06:07.956
Well, I'm not
a volcanologist...

06:08.024 --> 06:10.204
And glad of it, am I right?

06:10.272 --> 06:12.904
But the Mua Mua were always
talking about how Tarako

06:12.972 --> 06:14.421
was way overdue to erupt.

06:14.522 --> 06:16.144
- Bad news.
- Great.

06:16.212 --> 06:18.300
Oh, how would
a bunch of cannibals know?

06:18.368 --> 06:19.379
Oral tradition?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.732
And, you know,
technically,

06:20.800 --> 06:22.198
now you're all
cannibals, so...

06:22.266 --> 06:24.166
I had one little kebab!

06:24.234 --> 06:25.943
What were we supposed
to do, insult them?

06:26.011 --> 06:27.369
Plus, I was
pretty hungry.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.706
Can we just
pick a direction?

06:33.459 --> 06:36.151
Well, they're both
pretty well lit...

06:36.230 --> 06:38.269
- I say we turn back.
- <i>Quel choc.</i>

06:38.347 --> 06:40.348
Then go!
Nobody's stopping you!

06:40.416 --> 06:41.548
Fine!

06:42.888 --> 06:43.926
<i>Quoi?</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:50.683
<i>Merde.</i>

06:50.751 --> 06:52.715
So... left?

06:52.783 --> 06:54.262
- I don't care.
- Lefty loosey.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.597
Okay, and was it just me,

06:55.665 --> 06:57.137
or when that big rumble
happened,

06:57.205 --> 07:00.468
was everybody for a second
like, "Oh, my God, Smaug"?

07:00.536 --> 07:01.663
Yes! Right?

07:01.731 --> 07:03.370
- Who?
- Oh, my God!

07:03.472 --> 07:04.571
It's like...

07:04.674 --> 07:06.342
He's got
no frame of reference.

07:06.409 --> 07:07.512
Smaug, dickhead!

07:07.580 --> 07:10.247
The fire-breathing dragon
who lives under the mountain!

07:28.368 --> 07:29.436
Whoa.

07:29.504 --> 07:30.725
- God damn it.
- Um...

07:30.793 --> 07:33.655
So when you say
"way overdue"...

07:33.723 --> 07:36.616
I don't know, 10 years?
10,000?

07:36.684 --> 07:38.989
So either way,
probably not great.

07:39.057 --> 07:40.778
Ugh!
Look.

07:41.301 --> 07:42.509
It's a dead end!

07:42.611 --> 07:44.600
Damn it, I said
we should go right!

07:44.668 --> 07:45.723
No, you didn't!

07:45.791 --> 07:46.823
Well?

07:46.895 --> 07:49.092
Okay, so let's double back.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.464
No, look, I think
there's a door here!

07:51.532 --> 07:53.303
- Where?
- And-And some crazy

07:53.371 --> 07:55.136
cannibal cartoons...

07:55.253 --> 07:56.605
Petroglyphs!

07:56.675 --> 07:57.685
What do they say?

07:57.753 --> 08:00.394
Um... uh...

08:00.495 --> 08:01.925
- Noah!
- Okay.

08:02.088 --> 08:06.011
It says this is the temple
of the fire God Tarako,

08:06.136 --> 08:07.842
guarded by the <i> tupua.</i>

08:07.910 --> 08:09.600
There's a powerful curse...

08:09.668 --> 08:13.374
Which the Mua Mua already
told me about, so, uh...

08:14.871 --> 08:15.990
That's pretty good.

08:16.058 --> 08:17.479
- What?
- What does it say?

08:17.546 --> 08:18.550
Well, it's a pun.

08:18.617 --> 08:20.351
It makes a play
on the word for "curse"

08:20.419 --> 08:22.592
but also the word
for "soup,"

08:22.660 --> 08:25.191
but it's more like a stew,
I guess, like, um...

08:25.259 --> 08:28.194
Oh, we don't really have
a word for it in Engl... ow!

08:28.389 --> 08:30.631
We do have a word
for it! "Stew"!

08:30.699 --> 08:32.076
Does it say
how to open the door?

08:32.144 --> 08:35.089
- Yeah, it says "push."
- Idiot.

08:36.269 --> 08:39.355
Wait, so do we want to talk
about this curse or...

08:39.423 --> 08:40.621
What?

08:40.803 --> 08:43.604
- Ooh!  - Ooh!  - Ooh!
- Ooh!  - Ooh!

08:44.073 --> 08:45.231
Huh.

08:45.299 --> 08:47.526
Well?
Where's the damn idol?

08:47.594 --> 08:49.761
Um... Noah?

08:49.948 --> 08:51.221
- I don't kn...
- Ow!

08:51.289 --> 08:52.748
Then what the hell good
are you?

08:52.816 --> 08:54.550
I got us in the door,
didn't I?

08:54.617 --> 08:56.006
I think it's safe to assume

08:56.074 --> 08:57.443
we would've tried
pushing on it.

08:57.511 --> 08:59.387
Maybe eventually, but...

08:59.455 --> 09:01.607
No, no, it's gotta be here!

09:01.675 --> 09:02.932
- Come on, help me look.
- Okay.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.552
- Looking. I'm looking.
- All right.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.777
Well, if you find a bar,

09:05.867 --> 09:08.339
I'll take a mai tai,
hold the fruit juice.

09:08.407 --> 09:10.170
- What the...
- Uh...

09:10.238 --> 09:13.128
Whoa! Look!
Check it out!

09:13.196 --> 09:15.068
- Is it a bar?
- Why...

09:15.136 --> 09:16.787
- would it be a bar?
- Why wouldn't it?

09:16.855 --> 09:19.740
This whole place is like
a prehistoric Trader Vic's.

09:19.808 --> 09:22.100
Ooh, I think
her totem pole did it!

09:22.168 --> 09:24.722
Uh, actually, totem poles
are indigen... ow!

09:24.800 --> 09:27.675
Holy shit!
Pam, sit on that one.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.144
Reynaud, sit on yours!

09:32.668 --> 09:34.818
Okay, uh,
lady whose life I ruined!

09:34.886 --> 09:37.316
Oh, my God,
I forgot about that.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.572
- It's working!
- Look at that.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.060
- <i>Voilà!</i>
- Noah! Princess!

09:41.128 --> 09:42.563
Come on, go, go, go!

09:45.768 --> 09:49.394
Holy shit!
It's a giant emerald!

09:49.550 --> 09:52.011
- That is awesome.
- <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>

09:52.104 --> 09:54.776
Wait a minute.
Do emeralds glow in the dark?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.553
No...
but uranium does.

09:57.621 --> 09:58.680
- Uranium?
- What?

09:58.748 --> 10:00.717
Seriously?
I bet uranium's worth

10:00.785 --> 10:02.941
a jillion times more
than emeralds!

10:03.113 --> 10:05.193
- Sterling, wait!
- What?

10:05.261 --> 10:08.904
- It's radioactive!
- Oh, of course.

10:08.972 --> 10:11.492
That's what the whole
"death soup" thing was about.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.943
God damn it, Noah!

10:13.011 --> 10:14.725
The Mua Mua legend
says anybody

10:14.793 --> 10:16.295
who touches the idol
starts puking

10:16.363 --> 10:18.599
and shitting blood
and then, uh, melts.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.178
Now you tell us?

10:20.246 --> 10:21.480
Also, ew?

10:21.548 --> 10:22.980
Come to think of it,

10:23.128 --> 10:25.447
I don't know how anybody
could've carved it.

10:25.515 --> 10:28.609
Why would those cannibals
let us come all this way

10:28.677 --> 10:30.990
to find the damn thing
if they knew it would kill us?

10:31.058 --> 10:32.488
I really can't stress

10:32.556 --> 10:34.350
how much they hate
white people.

10:34.418 --> 10:36.300
Even after
we ate Nazis together?

10:36.368 --> 10:37.584
Oh, yeah. I bet

10:37.652 --> 10:40.097
they're laughing
their well-toned asses off.

10:46.011 --> 10:48.629
Well, then they're not
really our friends.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.162
- Wow.
- Had to be said.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.271
Okay, so how do we
get it out of here

10:52.339 --> 10:53.959
without shitting ourselves
to death?

10:54.027 --> 10:55.503
- How can we do this?
- Um... - I don't know.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.574
Lead!

10:56.642 --> 10:58.204
- Um...
- So stupid.

10:58.298 --> 10:59.540
Like when you get an X-ray!

10:59.608 --> 11:02.123
Hey, that's right!
Lead's a natural radiation shield!

11:02.191 --> 11:03.310
Hey, he's right!

11:03.378 --> 11:04.386
<i>He's</i> right?

11:04.454 --> 11:06.374
- Yeah, you heard the man.
- Ugh!

11:06.442 --> 11:07.644
So where are we
going to find

11:07.721 --> 11:10.535
enough lead in this place
to wrap it up?

11:11.386 --> 11:14.003
Perhaps I can help.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.972
No, thank you!

11:23.916 --> 11:25.682
<i>Merde!</i>

11:27.653 --> 11:28.987
Ugh!

11:31.957 --> 11:33.823
We got company!

11:33.971 --> 11:35.871
Late. Stupid.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.696
Hey, Fritz!
You got company!

11:40.939 --> 11:41.972
God damn it.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.537
You are powerless
against ueber-Fuchs!

11:48.807 --> 11:51.541
So hey, after we
get outta here...

11:51.643 --> 11:53.334
You think we're gonna
live through this?

11:53.402 --> 11:54.820
Why wouldn't we?

11:56.733 --> 11:59.281
- Reloading!
- Firing!

11:59.427 --> 12:02.038
What the...

12:07.274 --> 12:09.174
God... damn it!

12:09.242 --> 12:11.431
It's not often
you find a primitive people

12:11.499 --> 12:13.025
who understand
the callback.

12:13.093 --> 12:14.631
Oh! Aw, crap.

12:14.804 --> 12:16.328
I gotta rewrite
my thesis.

12:16.399 --> 12:18.166
Son of a...

12:22.429 --> 12:23.573
Ha-ha!

12:23.675 --> 12:25.515
How do you like them apples?

12:32.751 --> 12:33.885
Ow!

12:34.046 --> 12:35.687
I don't like
those apples at all!

12:35.754 --> 12:38.007
Right? Could things
get any worse?

12:39.921 --> 12:41.859
Maybe I <i> am</i> a Goddess!

12:41.989 --> 12:43.140
Ow!

12:43.208 --> 12:44.429
Thank you!

12:44.997 --> 12:46.531
<i>Was ist los?</i>

12:46.617 --> 12:49.069
Holy shit, look!

12:52.738 --> 12:54.773
- Shit!
- Well, shit.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.741
Check it out! Lava!

12:57.843 --> 13:00.335
Oh, I wonder if that's
what the petroglyphs meant

13:00.403 --> 13:01.793
by "death soup."

13:01.895 --> 13:04.225
Oh, yeah, kinda makes sense.

13:04.293 --> 13:05.999
I mean, if you think abo... ow!

13:06.067 --> 13:08.184
Guys, come on,
that's dangerous.

13:09.926 --> 13:11.499
Yes, fools!

13:11.567 --> 13:13.657
Cower before me!

13:13.778 --> 13:17.882
Just like the world will cower
before the German Reich

13:17.950 --> 13:19.700
once we have the idol!

13:19.770 --> 13:20.831
Says who?

13:20.899 --> 13:23.633
Says <i> mein Fuehrer,</i>
Adolf Hitler!

13:23.701 --> 13:26.491
The idol is pure uranium!

13:26.559 --> 13:29.421
And with it, we will construct
a <i> Wunderwaffe</i>

13:29.489 --> 13:32.694
with the power to destroy
entire cities!

13:32.762 --> 13:33.770
Typical.

13:33.838 --> 13:36.090
- Of what?
- I don't know, Nazis?

13:36.158 --> 13:37.989
Oh, for the...
Will you do something?

13:38.057 --> 13:40.536
Like what,
play "Dem Bones" at him?

13:40.604 --> 13:43.809
Oh, great,
now that's stuck in my head.

13:49.889 --> 13:50.947
Look! He's empty too!

13:51.015 --> 13:52.854
Well, yeah, but...

13:57.087 --> 13:58.126
Damn!

13:58.194 --> 14:00.479
He's still a giant robot.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.494
- Seriously?
- Yeah, look at him.

14:02.562 --> 14:04.080
So you're not
gonna do anything?

14:04.148 --> 14:05.838
Well, I'm no good
to us dead.

14:05.906 --> 14:07.580
What good are you alive?

14:22.654 --> 14:24.307
And what do you think
you're doing?

14:24.471 --> 14:26.994
I... have company.

14:27.227 --> 14:28.744
God damn it.

14:28.813 --> 14:29.946
Well...

14:33.586 --> 14:34.794
Pam!

14:38.094 --> 14:40.195
- No! - No! - No!
- No! - No!

14:40.263 --> 14:41.974
Sterling!

14:51.517 --> 14:54.317
That... was your plan?

14:54.552 --> 14:55.585
It worked, didn't it?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.434
- I mean...
- Get off me, you fool!

14:57.540 --> 14:59.028
Shut up!

14:59.096 --> 15:01.754
Somebody do something!

15:02.074 --> 15:03.754
I will go for help!

15:05.593 --> 15:07.393
<i>Merci,</i> asshole!

15:07.461 --> 15:08.711
Not a problem!

15:09.305 --> 15:11.289
Archer, it's too heavy!

15:11.357 --> 15:13.133
I can't hang on!

15:13.527 --> 15:14.554
Hang on!

15:14.622 --> 15:16.672
No, that's what I'm saying.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.687
I'm saying it like
"give me a second."

15:18.755 --> 15:19.896
Yeah, I get that,

15:19.964 --> 15:21.898
-  but...
- Jesus Christ, will you shut up?

15:21.966 --> 15:24.161
<i>Nein, nein, nein!</i>
What are you doing?

15:24.308 --> 15:25.844
Sending you...

15:26.183 --> 15:27.875
Sterling!

15:27.966 --> 15:30.484
To hell!

15:30.552 --> 15:31.552
<i>Nein!</i>

15:31.923 --> 15:33.656
- No!
- Sterling!

15:34.771 --> 15:37.508
Oh, for the love of God!

15:38.659 --> 15:41.593
This actually...
weighs the same.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.561
I realize that, idiot!

15:43.629 --> 15:45.598
Oh,<i> I'm</i> the idiot?

15:45.807 --> 15:46.807
I mean...

15:46.893 --> 15:48.761
What! Wait!
No, no, no!

15:48.829 --> 15:50.695
Archer, no! Hang on!

15:50.763 --> 15:52.312
Oh, hey, Princess!

15:52.380 --> 15:54.947
Listen... listen,
if we ever meet again...

15:55.015 --> 15:56.945
- Sterling, no!
- Don't let go!

15:57.013 --> 15:58.879
Just remember this...

15:59.218 --> 16:02.319
we were this close to banging.

16:04.871 --> 16:06.062
No, we weren't.

16:06.197 --> 16:08.753
Yes, we...
were!

16:10.487 --> 16:12.011
Sterling!

16:13.760 --> 16:15.972
<i>Nein!</i>

16:19.141 --> 16:21.464
This close.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.192
Oh.

18:46.406 --> 18:48.215
Oh, oh.

18:49.278 --> 18:52.212
Oh, for the...
Come on, seriously?

18:52.291 --> 18:54.340
What, you couldn't find
a snow globe?

18:54.893 --> 18:56.567
Oh, quit your bitching.

18:56.715 --> 18:59.364
Good morning... Mother!

18:59.846 --> 19:01.612
Shut up.
