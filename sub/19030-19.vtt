00:01.634 --> 00:03.295
<i>J.D.: Previously on</i> Scrubs...

00:03.336 --> 00:05.736
- How'd you sleep?
- Really well, actually.

00:05.772 --> 00:08.002
I knew it. You want to know why?
This is my bed.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.066
I had it brought here
because it's so comfortable.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.408
So we live together.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.211
Kind of, I guess.

00:14.647 --> 00:16.615
You are sneak-moving-in!

00:16.649 --> 00:17.946
Your ears are playing tricks.

00:17.984 --> 00:20.885
And, J.D., people should make a big
deal about you leaving Sacred Heart.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.285
But don't be disappointed

00:22.322 --> 00:25.257
if it doesn't live up to the expectations
you have in your head, okay?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.796
It's also the penny that
you put in the door eight years ago.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.594
For the last time,
I did not put a penny in the door.

00:33.633 --> 00:34.691
Admit it!

00:34.868 --> 00:37.894
Huntington's is caused by
a faulty gene.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.303
And since your mother has it,

00:40.340 --> 00:43.070
you have a 50-50 chance
of having it, too.

00:43.443 --> 00:47.345
Newbie, I know that you want this to be
a very special day for the both of us.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.177
I get that. I truly do.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.275
You want feelings to be shared
and you want hugs to flow.

00:52.318 --> 00:56.618
But that is not now, nor has it ever been
who I am, and you know that.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.692
How could Dan not want to know
if he has Huntington's disease?

01:07.734 --> 01:11.727
Maybe he's in denial.
I mean, if it were me, I'd be going crazy.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.500
I'm going to go talk to him.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.734
I implore you,

01:14.774 --> 01:17.902
please do the one thing
that I am beyond confident

01:17.944 --> 01:20.310
that you know how to do. Nothing.
Do nothing.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.871
It is the patient's decision.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.077
Has Perry told you
how he feels about you yet?

01:25.118 --> 01:27.052
No, and he says he's not going to.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.385
Well, just wait him out.
You'll beat him in the end.

01:29.422 --> 01:34.416
Un... Let it arrive. Acceptable.
Unacceptable.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.695
- You love torturing him, don't you?
- I do.

01:39.666 --> 01:43.898
How come you never tortured me,
you know, like, when I first started?

01:43.937 --> 01:47.737
You were Bambi. Somebody had
to teach you how to walk.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.138
Thank you for that.

01:52.545 --> 01:54.410
For being my teacher.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.114
No problem.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.953
Is there anything I can do
to repay the favor?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.754
Tell me my husband loves me
more than he loves you.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.624
It's about the same.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.453
I'll take it.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.498
I'm going to miss you, Bambi.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.062
I'm going to miss you, too.

- Why are you stopping?
- Why are you stopping?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.885
- I don't want to say.
- Just say.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.585
Let's face it.
We said goodbye too early.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.389
I don't think I've got another hug in me.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.759
Honest to God, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

02:43.796 --> 02:47.061
How could I ever not want to hug you?
Has the world gone mad?

02:47.100 --> 02:49.330
This is crazy. We can do this.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.202
You're absolutely right, buddy.
Come here.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.644
- Nope. Not feeling it.
- You smell like regret. Let it go.

03:03.883 --> 03:07.216
Young lady, are you responsible
for jamming those elevator doors?

03:07.253 --> 03:10.381
- No, good sir, I am not.
- Tell the truth.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.921
Okay, I did it, but it was an accident.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.754
That's okay, because you came clean.

03:17.096 --> 03:20.088
And here's $ 10 to buy some ice cream.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.364
This is stupid.
He blackmailed me into doing this.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.530
No improv-ing.
Give me the money back.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.973
No. My script says to rip it up
and walk away dramatically.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.742
She was supposed to be
my long-Iost sister.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.379
- Were you getting that?
- Look, it's been a very long day.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.446
Well, long days are like pancakes...
Admit it!

03:43.489 --> 03:46.481
Fine! I put a penny in the door!
It was eight years ago.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.222
- What do you know? It finally worked.
- It was an accident.

03:49.262 --> 03:52.288
It fell out of my pocket
and rolled into the door.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.062
It was my first day.
I didn't want you to be mad.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.763
- Do you believe me?
- Yeah. I saw it happen.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.637
If you saw it happen,
then why did you ask me back then

04:00.673 --> 04:03.608
- if I put a penny in the door?
- It was a test of character.

04:03.643 --> 04:07.135
You failed, and you lost out
on a wonderful friendship.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.308
We could still be friends.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.623
<i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

04:19.659 --> 04:21.286
<i>No, I know</i>

04:21.327 --> 04:23.625
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:26.499 --> 04:28.194
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:30.503 --> 04:33.597
So you're actually going to
stop working around here?

04:33.640 --> 04:34.732
That's right, Ted.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.937
So you're actually going to
stop working around...

04:38.811 --> 04:40.335
- Thanks.
- No worries.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.211
Did you know it's Dr. Dorian's last day?

04:42.248 --> 04:45.274
You should give him a hug
and share your feelings about him.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.446
- Do you think you're funny?
- Funny-Iooking! Pow!

04:52.191 --> 04:56.855
Hey, you. I'm trying to develop
a sentimental side,

04:56.896 --> 05:00.764
you know, for my stupid kids,
and you and I did it once, so...

05:04.871 --> 05:07.203
- Take care.
- Thanks, Jordan.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.141
So you're actually going to
stop working around here?

05:14.747 --> 05:17.614
Ted, come here.
I need to be horrible to someone.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.251
Well, that's weird, that you came.

05:20.286 --> 05:21.981
Ah, you seem like you need it.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.182
I'm super-sensitive
about my skin today.

05:24.223 --> 05:25.383
Focus on that.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.985
- It looks really blotchy.
- Yeah, and check this thing out.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.621
- Did you pick that?
- No, it did it by itself!

05:30.663 --> 05:33.029
I want to touch it, but I don't!

05:34.767 --> 05:36.792
Did you just page me to ask me

05:36.836 --> 05:39.396
how much ibuprofen to give
Mrs. Lenzner here?

05:39.439 --> 05:41.270
Well, I was worried
it would exacerbate the patient's...

05:41.307 --> 05:43.673
It's ibuprofen! Here's what you do.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.611
When she wakes up, get her
to open her mouth nice and wide,

05:46.646 --> 05:50.844
then get some of those ibuprofen pills
in your hands and throw them at her.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.943
Whatever sticks in there,
that's the correct dosage.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.217
- And the cycle repeats, huh?
- Beg your pardon?

05:57.256 --> 06:00.623
You yelled at me for the very
same thing when I was an intern.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.059
I'm going to go ahead and jot that down

06:02.095 --> 06:04.996
as one of the most fascinating
tidbits of the day.

06:06.065 --> 06:09.193
<i>J.D.: So maybe that's</i>
<i>who Perry Ulysses Cox is.</i>

06:09.235 --> 06:11.465
<i>A gruff, insensitive teacher.</i>

06:11.871 --> 06:16.001
<i>And after everything we went through,</i>
<i>if I'm still just another student to him,</i>

06:16.042 --> 06:18.135
<i>it doesn't mean I should be</i>
<i>any less grateful.</i>

06:18.177 --> 06:20.145
Thank you for everything, Dr. Cox.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.612
Keep moving.

06:24.951 --> 06:29.479
<i>J.D.: I expected that.</i>
<i>I didn't expect this.</i>

06:30.523 --> 06:31.581
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

06:31.624 --> 06:32.716
About what?

06:32.759 --> 06:33.919
- I blew my goodbye.
- The whole moving-in thing.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.656
- I did it too early, and now I can't hug...
- I totally blew it, because...

06:36.696 --> 06:38.561
Guys, can you not talk simultaneously?

06:38.598 --> 06:41.123
- I can, but I'm not sure she can.
- I can, but I'm not sure he can.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.692
- That was awesome!
- That was awesome!

06:43.736 --> 06:45.670
Turk, your goodbye was great.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.265
And Elliot, I told you to move stuff in

06:48.307 --> 06:51.003
because I want you to be there
all the time.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.977
I subletted my house.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.640
- That's aggressive.
- I can't help it, I lost my mind.

06:55.681 --> 06:59.412
Still, guys, I want you to know,
we're all good, okay?

07:00.219 --> 07:01.709
- Thanks.
- Okay.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.689
<i>J.D.: I understood their neediness,</i>
<i>because I'm feeling it myself.</i>

07:05.725 --> 07:08.523
<i>And I know what's causing it.</i>
<i>The future.</i>

07:09.162 --> 07:11.756
<i>I wanted to know what was next.</i>

07:11.798 --> 07:13.322
<i>Whether we would make it</i>
<i>as a couple.</i>

07:14.467 --> 07:17.061
<i>Whether I would stay tight</i>
<i>with my friend.</i>

07:17.103 --> 07:19.867
<i>Whether he'll even miss me</i>
<i>when I'm gone.</i>

07:21.974 --> 07:23.066
Hey.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.076
Hey. Where's your mom?

07:28.915 --> 07:32.783
They wheeled her out in her bed
to get some kind of scan.

07:33.853 --> 07:37.880
- I should probably go check on her.
- Before you go, I gotta ask,

07:38.658 --> 07:41.183
why aren't you gonna get that test?

07:43.696 --> 07:45.186
I don't know.

07:45.965 --> 07:51.267
I still might, you know,
in the next few years or days.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.134
But right now, if I found out

07:55.174 --> 07:58.041
that I was eventually going to die
from something...

08:01.347 --> 08:04.805
Once you learn that information,
you can't unlearn it.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.446
And this way, my future's still mine.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.247
It can be whatever I want it to be.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.955
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.663
Thanks.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.296
You're welcome.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.649
<i>J.D.: My last chart.</i>

08:44.690 --> 08:48.023
So your shift is officially over,
and that'll do it.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.924
Nice knowing you, John Dorian.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.124
It was nice knowing you, too...

08:54.267 --> 08:57.498
- What is your name?
- Glen Matthews.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.028
- Well, that was easy.
- Yeah, it's easy now.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.869
When I was a kid,
I had a horrible impediment.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.001
I'd say "Gen Maffewf."

09:04.710 --> 09:07.076
I'm glad I wasn't there
during those times.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.206
Yeah, I would've torn you to "pieffeff."

09:09.248 --> 09:12.240
- Why would you tell me now?
- It's the first time you've asked.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.185
- No, it's not.
- Pretty sure it is.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.347
I've been here for eight years,
and I don't know your name.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.620
I call you "The Janitor." I'm sure
I have asked you what your name is.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.593
- I don't think so.
- Really?

09:21.627 --> 09:23.857
People don't want to know
a janitor's name.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.729
You've probably forgotten
my name already.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.364
- Glen.
- Glen.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.629
Maffewf.

09:29.669 --> 09:33.765
Well, then, so long, Glen Matthews.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.137
So long.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.112
- Hey, Tommy.
- What's up?

09:43.783 --> 09:45.648
- <i>Adiós.</i>
- See you.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.346
<i>J.D.: Things rarely go exactly</i>
<i>the way you want them to,</i>

09:49.388 --> 09:52.653
<i>so sometimes you make do</i>
<i>with whatever you can get.</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:54.683
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:00.766 --> 10:05.669
Ah, he's finally gone. Talk about making
a big deal over nothing, you know?

10:07.239 --> 10:11.676
I mean, Dr. Dorian was fine, but he was
no better than any other doctor.

10:11.711 --> 10:15.738
For the record, he was the best
that ever came through this dump.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.546
John Dorian was the first
and only doctor I ever met

10:19.585 --> 10:21.576
who cared as much as I do,

10:21.621 --> 10:25.682
and you can forget about him
being just an exceptional physician.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.519
Because the fact of the matter is,
he was...

10:29.562 --> 10:32.087
He's a damn exceptional person.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.464
That's why people gravitated to him.
It's why I did.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.966
He was my friend.

10:42.074 --> 10:46.374
Thank you, God. That was beautiful.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.612
Oh, God, no.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.046
It's okay, Perry.
You just said how you feel.

10:52.084 --> 10:55.110
Honestly, I am so full
of your love right now,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.918
I literally could not take another drop.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.357
Brace yourself. I'm coming in.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.892
You smell like a father figure.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.023
Oh! Please stop.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.727
J.D.: Mmm.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.996
Great job, Sunny.
You said your line perfectly.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.167
Ah, thanks. I worked on it.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.176
I knew it would set you off.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.675
Good night, best friend.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.809
He thinks I'm an exceptional...

11:25.918 --> 11:26.976
...person!

11:27.820 --> 11:31.813
You realize that even though
he gets to leave, you have to stay?

11:32.258 --> 11:36.092
- I didn't think that out.
- No. You didn't.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.766
<i>J.D.: Endings are never easy.</i>

11:40.800 --> 11:42.665
<i>I always build them up</i>
<i>so much in my head,</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:45.068
<i>they can't possibly live up</i>
<i>to my expectations,</i>

11:45.104 --> 11:47.572
<i>and I just end up disappointed.</i>

11:47.606 --> 11:51.804
<i>I'm not even sure why it matters to me</i>
<i>so much how things end here.</i>

11:54.780 --> 11:56.577
<i>I guess it's because</i>
<i>we all want to believe</i>

11:56.615 --> 11:59.243
<i>that what we do is very important,</i>

11:59.285 --> 12:03.449
<i>that people hang on to our every word,</i>
<i>that they care what we think.</i>

12:04.090 --> 12:07.253
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>you should consider yourself lucky</i>

12:07.293 --> 12:12.788
<i>if you even occasionally get to make</i>
<i>someone, anyone, feel a little better.</i>

12:13.232 --> 12:16.201
<i>After that, it's all about the people</i>
<i>that you let into your life,</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:19.295
<i>and as my mind drifted to faces</i>
<i>I've seen here before,</i>

12:19.338 --> 12:21.272
<i>I was taken to memories of family...</i>

12:21.307 --> 12:23.138
Hey, little brother.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.905
<i>Of coworkers...</i>

12:26.946 --> 12:29.608
Goodbye five from the Big Dog.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.076
<i>Of lost loves...</i>

12:33.119 --> 12:34.643
You never called.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.320
I miss you.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.257
<i>Even of those who've left us.</i>

12:40.292 --> 12:41.987
There you are!

12:43.329 --> 12:44.660
Hi, tiger.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.359
<i>And as I rounded that corner,</i>
<i>they all came at me</i>

12:47.399 --> 12:49.765
<i>in a wave of shared experience.</i>

12:55.107 --> 12:56.938
Keep it holy, Q-tip.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.311
<i>Boing, fwap</i>

13:05.251 --> 13:08.482
I broke my penis again,
but this time it was fun.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.452
Take care, bra. Take real good care.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.593
I didn't kill her.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.567
Way to leave a cherry gig, bra.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.472
I got me some white meat.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.716
Key party later.
There will be prostitutes.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.117
Did you ever go on that picnic?
Make sure you do.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.887
I hate you so much, J.D.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.865
It's like a baguette.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.862
Hooch is crazy.

14:01.941 --> 14:06.969
<i>J.D.: And even though it felt warm</i>
<i>and safe, I knew it had to end.</i>

14:12.051 --> 14:14.952
<i>It's never good</i>
<i>to live in the past too long.</i>

14:15.588 --> 14:20.082
<i>As for the future, thanks to Dan,</i>
<i>it didn't seem so scary anymore.</i>

14:20.726 --> 14:23.354
<i>It could be whatever I want it to be.</i>

14:38.978 --> 14:42.937
<i>The book of love</i>
<i>is long and boring</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:47.811
<i>No one can lift the damn thing</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:53.681
<i>It's full of charts and facts and figures</i>

14:55.427 --> 14:58.954
<i>and instructions for dancing</i>

14:59.865 --> 15:05.132
<i>But I</i>

15:06.005 --> 15:09.702
<i>I love it when you read to me</i>

15:10.776 --> 15:15.907
<i>And you</i>

15:17.149 --> 15:20.846
<i>You can read me anything</i>

15:22.254 --> 15:26.350
<i>The book of love has music in it</i>

15:27.793 --> 15:31.786
<i>In fact that's where music comes from</i>

15:33.365 --> 15:37.631
<i>Some of it is just transcendental</i>

15:38.737 --> 15:42.730
<i>Some of it is just really dumb</i>

15:43.208 --> 15:48.236
<i>But I</i>

15:49.248 --> 15:53.116
<i>I love it when you sing to me</i>

15:53.886 --> 15:58.983
<i>And you</i>

16:00.426 --> 16:04.123
<i>You can sing me anything</i>

16:27.886 --> 16:32.152
<i>The book of love is long and boring</i>

16:33.325 --> 16:36.920
<i>And written very long ago</i>

16:38.931 --> 16:43.425
<i>It's full of flowers</i>
<i>and heart-shaped boxes</i>

16:44.603 --> 16:48.835
<i>And things we're all too young to know</i>

16:49.475 --> 16:54.674
<i>But I</i>

16:55.748 --> 16:59.844
<i>I love it when you give me things</i>

17:00.452 --> 17:05.388
<i>And you</i>

17:06.525 --> 17:11.019
<i>You ought to give me wedding rings</i>

17:11.563 --> 17:16.500
<i>And I</i>

17:17.336 --> 17:21.704
<i>I love it when you give me things</i>

17:22.207 --> 17:27.338
<i>And you</i>

17:28.781 --> 17:33.081
<i>You ought to give me wedding rings</i>

17:40.125 --> 17:45.461
<i>You ought to give me wedding rings</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:52.769
<i>J.D.: And who's to say</i>
<i>this isn't what happens?</i>

17:52.805 --> 17:58.641
<i>Who can tell me that my fantasies</i>
<i>won't come true, just this once?</i>

18:01.146 --> 18:02.545
Good night.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.647
Good night.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.515
<i>Out the door just in time</i>

18:47.559 --> 18:50.926
- Hey! Say "Action."
- Action.

18:51.163 --> 18:54.724
<i>Gotta meet the new boss by 8 a.m.</i>

18:56.502 --> 18:59.027
<i>The phone rings in the car</i>

18:59.071 --> 19:01.699
<i>The wife is workin' hard</i>

19:01.740 --> 19:05.301
<i>She's running late tonight again</i>

19:05.878 --> 19:08.642
<i>Well, I know what I've been told</i>

19:08.680 --> 19:10.375
Whoa!

19:10.849 --> 19:13.215
I want to touch it, but I don't!

19:16.455 --> 19:18.753
Eighteen hos, take one. Mark.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.553
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

19:20.592 --> 19:22.958
<i>You've got your love online</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:24.758
Oh, that's funny, because
we were bowling the other night,

19:24.796 --> 19:27.788
and he says, "Man, no one ever
says my name right,"

19:27.833 --> 19:30.996
and I says to him, I says, "Muh,
you got two bigger problems than that.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.698
"One of them is that seven-ten split
that you left for yourself,

19:33.739 --> 19:35.673
"and another one is,
how about trying to write a movie

19:35.707 --> 19:37.504
"without a big twist ending?"

19:37.543 --> 19:39.511
He says, "What's with the accent?"

19:39.545 --> 19:41.877
I said, "What d'you mean?
This is just how I grew up."

19:41.914 --> 19:43.472
He says,
"I'm going to put you in a movie."

19:43.549 --> 19:44.811
I said, "Okay."

19:44.850 --> 19:47.648
Then we're on a hayride later,
and he makes a monkey face.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.813
I said, "What in the world is this?"

19:49.855 --> 19:52.085
He says,
"Hey, man, welcome to the big time,"

19:52.124 --> 19:54.388
and he slaps me across the face.

19:54.426 --> 19:58.362
Why, I didn't know whether to .
Or write a screenplay.

20:00.799 --> 20:05.327
Zach, just hit him.
Zach, hit him. Hit him. Good God.

20:05.370 --> 20:09.204
Just hit him. Come on.
Come on. Hit him.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.334
You got me, you got me!

20:12.311 --> 20:15.803
J.D. AND ELLIOT:
<i>Gabby only listen on Fridays</i>

20:15.847 --> 20:17.712
<i>She doesn't really</i>

20:17.749 --> 20:19.614
Oh, my God, you're listening.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.211
That's a wrap
for Donald and Sarah.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.090
<i>You've crossed the finish line</i>

20:27.125 --> 20:29.958
<i>Won the race but lost your mind</i>

20:29.995 --> 20:31.257
<i>Was it worth it...</i>

20:31.296 --> 20:33.196
I'm going to miss you.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.029
Cut, check.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.062
That's a season wrap on Judy Reyes.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.003
Oh. Mmm.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.403
- I'm going to miss you so much.
- Yeah, well, you...

20:49.881 --> 20:52.611
- Yeah?
- Mmm. Let me get one of these.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.619
Oh, yeah, one of those?
Is that what you need?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.655
All right, Donald.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.253
- Camera set?
- Yeah.

21:10.869 --> 21:11.961
Cut. Check it.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.064
Hey, that's a season wrap on Zach Braff.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.674
Blanks, we're going hugs.
