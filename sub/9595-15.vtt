Okay, son, so when cody
confronts you,

You got a couple of different
techniques that you can use.

First up is
the throat chop, okay?

He can't talk.

I'd give him
a potato-chip wedgie.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.038
Hey, cody, I'm here
to finish what we started.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.105
All of a sudden you think
you're the man?

17:21.107 --> 17:22.273
'cause you got jokes?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.410
I don't have any jokes today,
just facts.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.178
[ crowd murmuring ]

17:27.180 --> 17:30.081
Guess who I found

17:31.083 --> 17:33.351
Please.
Please don't do this, okay?

18:00.246 --> 18:03.714
And why would they be
with these, uh...

18:03.716 --> 18:07.285
These, uh,
linguine arms?

18:07.287 --> 18:11.122
What do you cook these for?
Two, three minutes?

18:11.124 --> 18:14.292
I look like I should be
standing in front of a --

18:14.294 --> 18:16.594
In front of
an auto dealership.

18:16.596 --> 18:21.099

If you love mommy,

18:39.319 --> 18:43.121
You will go to sleep tonight
without the night-light.

18:43.123 --> 18:47.191
Actually, it's okay
if we use the night-light.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.826
Wait, really?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.762
Yeah, can we also leave
the lamp on and the door open?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.631
Hold on a second.
What's happening here?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.633
Does god listen to me?
Can you hear me, god?

18:55.635 --> 18:59.770
I may have tricked him
into watching "the shining."

19:01.406 --> 19:03.141
Aaaaah!

19:03.143 --> 19:05.576
Your sister dared you
to watch "the shining"?

You and daddy give
a lot of mixed messages.

I'm not proud
that you got molly-whopped,

But it's very cool how you
turned the roast on yourself.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.950
About only roasting people
who could handle it.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.351
Mm-hmm.
And I knew I could.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.554
From all the years
of you dumping on me
