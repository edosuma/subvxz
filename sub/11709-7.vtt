{\an8}AND ALL OF A SUDDEN--
- SWITCHED IT UP A LITTLE?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.709
{\an8}- SHE SWITCHED THE GAME UP
ON ME.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.335
{\an8}LIKE, ALMOST
LIKE YOU GET THE TITLE--

02:49.419 --> 02:50.503

02:50.587 --> 02:52.046
{\an8}"TIME FOR THE SEX
ON THE REGULAR, SON.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.673
{\an8}WHAT UP, THOUGH?"
AND I WAS LIKE--

02:53.756 --> 02:54.841
{\an8}SHE DIDN'T SAY,
"WHAT UP, THOUGH?"

02:54.924 --> 02:55.884
{\an8}BUT THAT'S, LIKE--
- YOU READY?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.595
{\an8}- OH, SO YOU GOT TURNED ON?
- I JUST--

02:58.678 --> 02:59.596
{\an8}IT WAS A LITTLE BIT,

02:59.679 --> 03:01.931
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNEW HER
FOR FOUR SUMMERS,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.266
{\an8}AND IT JUST CAUGHT ME
OFF GUARD.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.767
{\an8}- IT'S ONLY DAY ONE.
- I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.019
{\an8}- IT'S ONLY DAY ONE.
- I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.437
{\an8}I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT.
- IT'S ONLY DAY ONE.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.981
{\an8}- ALREADY YOU'RE FUCKING READY
TO JUMP SHIP?

03:10.064 --> 03:11.024
{\an8}YOU'RE PULLING 'CHUTE
ALREADY?

03:11.107 --> 03:12.108
{\an8}WOW.
- ARE YOU REALLY?

03:12.191 --> 03:14.652
{\an8}- NO! I SAID
I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.945
{\an8}I JUST WAS UNPREPARED.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.280
{\an8}SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT
MORE OUTGOING THAN NORMAL,

03:17.363 --> 03:18.448
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

03:18.531 --> 03:19.949
{\an8}SHE JUST--
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

03:20.033 --> 03:20.491
{\an8}- SHE WAS BEING A GIRLFRIEND.
- YEAH.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.493
{\an8}[laughing]

03:22.577 --> 03:23.786
{\an8}THE FOUR SUMMERS
THAT I KNOWN HER,

03:23.870 --> 03:24.954
{\an8}SHE WOULD SPEAK
WHEN SPOKEN TO, AND--

03:25.038 --> 03:26.331
{\an8}- SHE WOULD OBEY
IS WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.459
{\an8}- [laughing]
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.710
{\an8}I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.795
{\an8}- BRO, I'VE HAD SEX
THAT'S GONNA LAST LONGER

03:32.879 --> 03:35.924
{\an8}THAN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.258
{\an8}THE FACT THAT MIKE'S SAYING THAT
HE'S TRYING TO STICK IT OUT,

03:37.342 --> 03:41.304
{\an8}IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE DAY,
I'M JUST LIKE...

03:41.387 --> 03:42.513
{\an8}BRO, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH REHAB.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.891
{\an8}I MEAN, I THINK YOU CAN GET
THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.393
{\an8}- HI.
- WHAT UP?

03:47.477 --> 03:48.686
{\an8}- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- HELLO.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.104
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT UP? WHAT UP?

03:50.188 --> 03:52.315
{\an8}- DANNY, I HEARD
YOU HAVE A PRESENT FOR ME.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.150
{\an8}- SO I GOT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING DIFFERENT

03:54.233 --> 03:56.653
{\an8}FOR TODAY'S UNIFORM
FOR YOU TO WEAR.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.031
{\an8}- THIS IS AWESOME.
- WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

04:00.114 --> 04:02.867
{\an8}- YES!
- I GOT YOU A JUMPSUIT.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.328
{\an8}- REALLY?
- YES.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.996
{\an8}- REALLY, DANNY?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.708
{\an8}IT'S A LITTLE TOO SOON TO BE
MAKING JOKES ABOUT MY ARREST.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.336
{\an8}THIS IS TOO BIG ON ME.
DID YOU GET A MEN'S ONE?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.338
{\an8}BUT I LIKE TO HAVE FUN.
I LIKE DRESS-UP.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.257
{\an8}SO I ROCKED IT WITH PRIDE.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.843
{\an8}DOES THIS EVEN LOOK
FASHIONABLE?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.096
{\an8}- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
PULL 'CHUTE, BRO?

04:23.179 --> 04:27.016
{\an8}- I WILL SAY
THAT I DON'T LIKE TO BE CAGED

04:27.100 --> 04:28.101
{\an8}OR CONFINED.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.769
{\an8}- MOST--MOST DOGS DON'T.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.062
{\an8}- BUT I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS WORK.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.232
{\an8}ALL IT IS,
IS A FUCKING TITLE NOW.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.109
{\an8}AND SHE'S CHECKING UP ON ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE--THAT'S ALL.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.735
{\an8}NORMALLY, I'D PULL THE 'CHUTE
IMMEDIATELY.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.780
{\an8}BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE DAY
THAT ME AND PAULA ARE GOING OUT,

04:40.863 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}SO I'M TRYING HERE.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.157
{\an8}THERE IS, LIKE,
ONE OR TWO THINGS

04:43.241 --> 04:43.866
{\an8}THAT BOTHER ME ABOUT HER
A LITTLE BIT,

04:43.950 --> 04:45.368
{\an8}BUT I CAN FIX THAT.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.495
{\an8}IT'S LIKE THESE LITTLE,
LITTLE THINGS, YOU KNOW.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.539
{\an8}- WHAT?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.541
{\an8}- WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
IS EASILY FIXED.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.042
{\an8}YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO THE DENTIST
OR WHATEVER.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.753
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
HE FIXES THINGS.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.296
{\an8}IT CAN BE EASILY FIXED.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
{\an8}- WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE
HER TEETH?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.175
{\an8}- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST SAID THAT, LIKE--

05:01.259 --> 05:02.635
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:02.719 --> 05:03.970
{\an8}- HE'S SAYING,

05:04.053 --> 05:05.680
{\an8}"I'M GONNA GET HER
AN APPOINTMENT TO THE DENTIST."

05:05.763 --> 05:09.350
{\an8}- NO, I'M JUST SAYING I CAN
SPRUCE HER UP A LITTLE BIT.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.685
{\an8}PAULA IS A NATURAL 8.2.

05:10.768 --> 05:14.230
{\an8}LIKE, SHE'S GOT A PRETTY FACE.
SHE LOOKS GOOD NAKED.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.691
{\an8}ALL SHE NEEDS
IS A LITTLE FIXING UP.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.901
{\an8}- YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST
PUT A BAG OVER HER HEAD, MIKE.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.486
{\an8}- NO!
FUCK, BRO.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.239
{\an8}YOU KNOW, A GIRL SHOULD BE
SPOILED AND HAVE NICE THINGS.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.324
{\an8}I HAVE NO PROBLEM
SENDING HER TO THE STORE

05:25.408 --> 05:27.201
{\an8}WITH SOME--FOR SOME CLOTHES.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.495
{\an8}- MIKE JUST THINKS
HE JUST BOUGHT HIMSELF A DOLL.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.081
{\an8}I DON'T THINK TREATING
A GIRL LIKE A PRINCESS

05:32.165 --> 05:35.752
{\an8}MEANS MAKING HER
INTO YOUR LIFE-SIZE BARBIE DOLL.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.337
{\an8}YOU TAKE THEM
FOR WHATEVER THEY HAVE.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.090
{\an8}- I GUARANTEE YOU,
ONCE I SPRUCE HER UP,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.051
{\an8}SHE'S GONNA BOUNCE ON ME.
[laughter]

05:43.134 --> 05:44.218
{\an8}ONCE I SPRUCE HER UP
A LITTLE BIT.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.636
{\an8}- OH, SHIT, SHH.
HERE SHE COMES.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.222
{\an8}- WHAT THE...?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.141
{\an8}- FUCK.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.934
{\an8}- OH, SHIT.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.186
{\an8}WHAT'S THE ODDS
OF THAT HAPPENING?

05:53.269 --> 05:55.146
{\an8}SHE'S NEVER COME BY
THE SHORE STORE.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.355
{\an8}- OH, HEY!
- HI!

05:56.439 --> 05:57.231
{\an8}- WHAT UP, GIRL?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.775
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU?
- LOOK AT YOU.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.985
{\an8}- WHAT UP?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.653
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA BE FREAKED OUT
SHE CAME HERE.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.030
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

06:04.113 --> 06:05.281
{\an8}- WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE GIRLS' DAY.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.491
{\an8}- FOR REAL?
OH, OKAY.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.076
{\an8}GO DO THAT, THEN.
ALL RIGHT.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.118
{\an8}OKAY, COOL.
GO DO YOUR THING.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.870
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA JUMP SHIP.
- YEAH, HE IS.

06:10.953 --> 06:11.704
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA PULL 'CHUTE.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.456
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT?
- ALL RIGHTY.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.165
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
- WELL, HAVE FUN AT WORK.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.459
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.711
{\an8}- BYE.
- BYE.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.840
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE PAULA
IS A LITTLE TOO COMFORTABLE.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.425
{\an8}AND WHEN YOU'RE
A LITTLE TOO COMFORTABLE

06:24.509 --> 06:26.219
{\an8}IN A RELATIONSHIP,

06:26.302 --> 06:28.721
{\an8}SOONER THAN LATER,
YOU DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.223
{\an8}- YOU GOT A CALENDAR?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.433
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA HAVE A POOL
IN THE STORE.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.518
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE CALLED
THE PAULA POOL

06:33.601 --> 06:35.770
{\an8}TO SEE
WHEN YOU'RE PULLING 'CHUTE.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.146
{\an8}WHO'S GOT A BLANK PIECE
OF PAPER?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.314
{\an8}- YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.816
{\an8}- I GOT TEN DAYS.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.775

{\an8}POOR GIRL.

06:45.863 --> 06:46.989

WHAT SHE WAS IN FOR.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.075
{\an8}- WHO WANTS IN ON THIS?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.243
{\an8}BIG MONEY, BIG MONEY.

{\an8}- OKAY, BYE, BABE.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.455
{\an8}THAT IS A SUCCESS
IN THE SITUATION'S BOOK.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.256
{\an8}- OH, HEY, DEENA.

24:26.339 --> 24:31.636
{\an8}- WHAT UP, DEENA?

24:33.263 --> 24:34.514
{\an8}- I WAKE UP THIS MORNING,

{\an8}- I GOT TO EAT.
YOU GUYS READY TO GO?

24:40.854 --> 24:43.231
{\an8}WE'RE LEAVING.

{\an8}- UP IN HERE?
- YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.578
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GET
A COFFEE.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.663
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN GRIND ON CHICKS

24:58.747 --> 25:00.582

{\an8}YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.098
{\an8}- FUCK,
SHE STAYS ON YOUR EYES

25:17.182 --> 25:18.934
{\an8}UNTIL YOU CATCH HER.
- YEAH.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.938
{\an8}- THAT'S VERY FUCKED UP.
- THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.024
{\an8}I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT IN MY LIFE,

25:26.107 --> 25:27.359
{\an8}BUT SHE GIVES YOU
THIS BLANK STARE,

25:27.442 --> 25:29.152
{\an8}TILTS HER HEAD,
AND JUST STARES AT YOU.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.112
{\an8}I CAN'T LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION
WITHOUT HER LOOKING

25:31.196 --> 25:31.821

25:31.905 --> 25:33.490

AS SHE SEES YOU LOOK UP,

{\an8}LIKE, IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S LOOKING AWAY.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.204
{\an8}- IT'S JUST FUCKING AWKWARD.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.290
{\an8}SHE'S JUST LIKE THIS.
SHE'S GOT THIS, THOUGH.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.585
{\an8}- HER EYES
ARE PIERCING ME, SON.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.175
{\an8}- COULD I HAVE A HEMORRHOID?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.970
{\an8}I HAVE, LIKE, A SWOLLEN BUTTHOLE
FROM POOPING SO MUCH.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.305
{\an8}- IS IT BLEEDING?
- BLECH!

25:57.389 --> 26:00.850
{\an8}- NO. SORRY.
I HAD TO TELL SOMEBODY.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.811
{\an8}I WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.396
{\an8}- I'M READY TO GO.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.731
{\an8}- TODAY THE GUYS WANT
TO GO GTL.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.566
{\an8}I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TO GTL.
I WANT TO DO MY OWN THING.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.527

- EJ'S...

26:20.328 --> 26:22.163
{\an8}THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENS.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.332
{\an8}AND I CAN RUN WILD THERE,
AND NO ONE EVEN CARES.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.669
{\an8}- CAN I BUY YOU A SHOT?
- SURE.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.047

{\an8}I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO COOK FOR JIONNI,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.357
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE I WANT
TO IMPRESS HIM.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.650
{\an8}IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.361
{\an8}THIS IS SERIOUS. LIKE, THIS
IS GONNA BE MY HUSBAND.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.654
{\an8}I ACTUALLY WANT TO DO
A GOOD JOB.

26:57.615 --> 27:00.744
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.

27:00.827 --> 27:05.040
{\an8}OH, NO.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.751
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE BAD.

27:07.834 --> 27:11.087

IN THE OIL,

{\an8}AND THEN YOU PUT
THE TOMATO SAUCE OVER IT?
