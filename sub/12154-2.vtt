01:18.812 --> 01:21.288
You still smell like you.

01:28.352 --> 01:30.439
- Take it.
- Okay.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.572
I saw your ad on Craigslist.

01:35.697 --> 01:37.547
I need a private detective.

01:38.381 --> 01:39.631
Yes, of course.

01:40.253 --> 01:41.600
Thank you for calling.

01:42.471 --> 01:44.295
{\pos(110,260)}Can I get back to you
in a little while?

01:44.420 --> 01:46.334
{\pos(110,260)}I'm... I'm with another client.

01:46.459 --> 01:48.190
{\pos(110,260)}<i>But you'll definitely call back?</i>

01:48.358 --> 01:50.752
I need your help.
I think my boyfriend is cheating on me.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.529
<i>Yes, I promise I will
definitely call back.</i>

01:53.697 --> 01:55.725
Okay, goodbye now.
I'm sorry about that.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.892
It's all right.
A new girlfriend?

01:58.017 --> 01:59.594
No, of course not.
I don't have...

01:59.719 --> 02:01.676
Wait a second.
Are you seeing someone?

02:01.801 --> 02:03.470
{\pos(270,260)}Let's not talk about it.

02:03.595 --> 02:04.921
{\pos(270,260)}You just asked me.

02:05.046 --> 02:07.419
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.716
No, I'm not seeing anyone,

02:09.841 --> 02:12.711
but we shouldn't talk
about that kind of stuff.

02:12.836 --> 02:14.492
{\pos(110,260)}We should really only discuss

02:14.617 --> 02:16.719
{\pos(110,260)}neutral, non-painful topics.

02:17.069 --> 02:19.748
But all topics with you
feel painful.

02:20.295 --> 02:22.834
{\pos(110,260)}Let's just start over, okay?

02:24.332 --> 02:26.937
- So how are you?
- I'm in pain.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.026
I need you.
I miss you.

02:29.151 --> 02:30.816
I'm living like an animal.

02:31.106 --> 02:34.449
I have no toilet paper, no food,
no toothpaste. I miss you.

02:34.574 --> 02:36.903
You miss me shopping for us.
That's great.

02:37.028 --> 02:38.892
{\pos(110,260)}No, I miss more than that...

02:42.595 --> 02:44.695
you forgot my box of love notes.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.584
I brought it for you.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.278
"I love you more than you know.

02:50.403 --> 02:51.403
"Jonathan."

02:52.496 --> 02:54.046
{\pos(110,260)}That was a nice note.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.785
But you don't have to read the name{\ at the end}.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.410
{\pos(110,260)}I'm very literal-minded.
You know that.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.546
Is that Ray?

03:02.305 --> 03:03.724
Is he coming in here?

03:04.083 --> 03:06.261
I thought I might need
to see him after seeing you.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.263
I didn't think you'd overlap.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.940
Jonathan, I don't like
to see your friends.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.601
This is really hard
for me too, you know.

03:14.625 --> 03:15.725
How are you?

03:16.247 --> 03:18.306
Okay.
I was just going.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.809
It's okay. I can sit
right over there.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.577
I really need to go.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.186
- Say hi to Leah for me, though.
- Okay.

03:34.664 --> 03:37.975
I can't believe it.
She forgot my box of love notes.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.194
Tell me about it, man.
Women are tough.

03:40.319 --> 03:42.221
Leah's making me get
a colonic tomorrow.

03:43.052 --> 03:43.931
What?

03:44.148 --> 03:45.726
She wants me to get a colonic...

03:45.851 --> 03:47.869
something about me being
in a bad mood all the time

03:47.994 --> 03:49.709
because I'm leaking toxins.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.439
- Leaking toxins from where?
- You gotta go with me.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.759
I have a real phobia around my ass.

03:54.884 --> 03:56.384
Yeah, sure, I'll go.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.647
{\I guess }It's a good thing
that you're willing to change for Leah.

03:59.772 --> 04:02.383
If I had changed for Suzanne
she wouldn't have moved out.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.342
I'm not gonna change.
I'm gonna pretend{\ to change}.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.203
I can't change.
That's impossible.

04:06.959 --> 04:09.209
"You're my best friend.
Jonathan."

04:09.577 --> 04:11.442
You're my best friend too, Ray.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.669
- No, I'm just reading this thing.
- Come on{\, come on}.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.380
These are my love notes.
Don't read these. Give me these.

04:23.985 --> 04:25.035
I'm just...

04:33.482 --> 04:36.842
- What are you doing?
- Hey, I'm just practicing the speech

04:36.967 --> 04:38.903
I have to give tomorrow in my mind.

04:39.173 --> 04:40.502
I need an audience.

04:40.627 --> 04:41.906
All of manhattan?

04:42.255 --> 04:43.605
I love this city.

04:43.804 --> 04:46.351
I was walking around this morning
and I saw this woman

04:46.476 --> 04:48.885
who looked exactly like...

04:49.215 --> 04:51.456
you know, that actress
in the Almodovar film.

04:51.581 --> 04:53.299
- With the big nose?
- Yes.

04:53.655 --> 04:55.755
I would love one night with her.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.822
She might be completely boring,

04:57.947 --> 05:00.708
but the nose would be
so distracting,

05:00.833 --> 05:02.483
you couldn't get bored.

05:02.787 --> 05:05.079
Men must chase after her like crazy.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.931
Yeah, but she probably never knows

05:07.099 --> 05:09.815
if someone wants her
for her nose or for herself.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.887
That's true.
That's true.

05:13.524 --> 05:16.373
But then nobody's really loved
for themselves, are they?

05:16.498 --> 05:18.148
All love is projection.

05:18.614 --> 05:19.443
Really?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.179
Come on, think about it.

05:21.304 --> 05:24.490
You know, I'm in your movie
and you're in mine...

05:24.841 --> 05:26.700
two different films really.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.937
We don't really know each other.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.887
We're{\ just} making guesses
at knowing each other, right?

05:32.013 --> 05:33.908
I think the same is true about love.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.450
You purposely try to depress me
every time we see each other.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.747
Yes, I do.

05:39.872 --> 05:42.166
Now why are you here, young'un?

05:43.063 --> 05:44.424
Right right.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.763
The green issue
is coming around again.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.900
Now I want you
to go out and ask people

05:51.025 --> 05:53.404
what's most upsetting to them
about the environment...

05:53.529 --> 05:55.896
you know, man-on-the-street...

05:57.052 --> 05:58.232
please. Right.

05:58.728 --> 05:59.728
Why not?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.128
Is it a woman?

06:03.763 --> 06:04.763
Sort of.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.774
Jennifer Gladwell?

06:16.213 --> 06:19.192
- Jonathan, the private detective?
- That's right.

06:22.546 --> 06:24.368
Can I just have a white wine?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.694
I thought you'd be older.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.026
Yeah, well,
I got into the business at a young age.

06:30.151 --> 06:31.995
I was drawn to it.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.885
Would you like a drink drink?

06:34.010 --> 06:36.168
No, I'm on the water wagon tonight.

06:36.293 --> 06:37.443
I understand.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.537
I avoid the wagon
by drinking white wine.

06:39.704 --> 06:41.234
It has a very low alcohol content.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.819
That's really smart.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.570
I love white wine,

06:45.907 --> 06:46.807
and red,

06:47.781 --> 06:48.681
and rum.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.203
So tell me what's going on.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.830
{\You think }Your boyfriend's cheating{\ on you}?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.475
I'm not 100% sure,

06:56.600 --> 06:57.980
but I'm, like, 95% sure.

06:58.105 --> 07:00.544
I did try to access his email,
but he changed his password.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.879
You had his password?

07:02.432 --> 07:04.577
Well, yeah.
Just like a year ago

07:05.013 --> 07:06.717
I went through a jealous phase.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.416
- But this time it's real.
- {\Are you }Sure?

07:08.541 --> 07:12.014
That's what one of my therapists said.
"Are you sure?" Yes, I'm sure.

07:12.311 --> 07:14.641
God, it's like I'm surrounded
by holocaust deniers.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.353
It happened.

07:16.638 --> 07:17.588
I'm sure.

07:17.863 --> 07:19.730
{\You know, }My therapists
aren't helping me at all,

07:19.898 --> 07:21.523
{\which is why I contacted you.}But if you can't help me

07:21.791 --> 07:24.469
then maybe I should go back
and find someone else who can help me.

07:24.594 --> 07:26.195
{\I'm sorry.}I do want to help you.

07:27.483 --> 07:29.907
Has your boyfriend been
acting differently in any way?

07:31.553 --> 07:33.122
We don't live together,

07:33.536 --> 07:34.909
so when I call him at night

07:35.034 --> 07:37.748
his phone goes straight to voicemail,
which it never used to.

07:38.978 --> 07:41.464
And he's always been
very available to me,

07:41.589 --> 07:43.139
which is what I need.

07:45.091 --> 07:47.037
So you'd like me to follow him...

07:47.162 --> 07:48.212
A tail job?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.737
A tail job, yeah.

07:52.262 --> 07:53.762
I brought a picture.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.023
- He's a good-looking guy.
- Yeah.

08:02.212 --> 08:03.662
All women want him.

08:05.515 --> 08:09.404
Have you{\ and your boyfriend} been having specific problems
other than the voicemail issue?

08:09.952 --> 08:11.632
He thinks I drink too much,

08:11.757 --> 08:13.246
which is why i'm quitting.

08:13.371 --> 08:15.786
Really? My girlfriend left me
for the same reason.

08:16.069 --> 08:17.371
But it's all projection.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.241
It's her father who's the alcoholic.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.636
I just have, like...

08:20.761 --> 08:22.461
two white wines a night.

08:23.171 --> 08:24.795
Yeah, I do drink more than that.

08:25.647 --> 08:28.522
But you're right.
Gary's mother is an alcoholic.

08:28.647 --> 08:32.385
That makes sense,{\because} in every relationship
we're either with our mother or father.

08:32.647 --> 08:34.826
I think Gary is my father.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.768
My girlfriend Suzanne
was my father... as a woman, you know.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.345
And nothing I did was right{\ in her eyes}.

08:41.470 --> 08:43.496
And that's{\ exactly} what it was
like growing up with my dad.

08:43.621 --> 08:46.191
I'm sorry, I don't care
about your girlfriend or your dad.

08:46.407 --> 08:50.115
I really just need you to find
out if Gary is cheating on me.

08:50.521 --> 08:52.171
I can't sleep at night.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.764
I would like a white wine, please.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.452
I would like a vodka martini, dry,
with an olive.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.393
Are you sure you don't want
to have the white wine...

09:06.444 --> 09:08.028
Thanks again for being here, man.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.047
No, I like being here.

09:10.643 --> 09:13.260
This pamphlet has a lot
of good information in it.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.443
You know, we really should
all be vegans.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.866
I'm kind of a non-practicing vegan.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.637
That's the other thing...
Leah wants me to change my diet.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.721
So when I'm with her
I'm gonna eat healthy,

09:23.846 --> 09:26.023
and when I'm not{\ with her}
I'm gonna eat like an American.

09:26.687 --> 09:27.900
Can you pull that off?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.621
Yeah. It's just a double life,

09:29.746 --> 09:31.403
but we all lead double lives.

09:33.937 --> 09:36.799
Ray, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.720
Oh, shit.
I hate when people say that. What?

09:40.220 --> 09:42.422
Three weeks ago
when Suzanne moved out

09:42.698 --> 09:44.541
I put up an ad on Craigslist.

09:44.783 --> 09:47.587
So? Everybody does that.
I bought Birkenstocks on Craigslist.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.879
This is different.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.793
I put up a listing advertising myself
as a private detective.

09:54.013 --> 09:54.885
A what?

09:55.053 --> 09:58.388
I've been moonlighting
as a private detective on the side.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.766
- You can't do that. That's illegal.
- Why?

10:00.934 --> 10:04.323
I say that I'm not licensed.
And that makes it more legalish.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.105
You have to take that down.
You can't just do that.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.717
No, I've already had a client.
I found the missing girl.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.820
It was like
an out-of-body experience.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.571
I wasn't me.
I was... heroic.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.800
Are you delusional?

10:15.925 --> 10:17.916
No, I keep getting calls.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.534
I just got my second case.

10:19.892 --> 10:22.613
I have been reading
so many of these detective novels

10:22.738 --> 10:24.790
that I know what to do.

10:25.274 --> 10:26.596
I can help people.

10:26.721 --> 10:29.450
Jonathan, I consider myself
a very open-minded friend.

10:29.575 --> 10:31.822
Half the people I know
are disturbed.

10:32.238 --> 10:34.659
But you cannot just go around

10:35.027 --> 10:36.827
and say that you're a detective.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.013
You can't mess with people's lives{\ like that}.
You can barely lead your own life.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.884
Which one of you is Ray Houston?

10:43.209 --> 10:45.060
- That's me.
- I am happy to meet you.

10:45.286 --> 10:46.286
I'm Yusef.

10:47.157 --> 10:49.314
And who is this?
Your partner?

10:51.541 --> 10:53.728
He's my friend.
He's here to support me.

10:54.228 --> 10:55.195
That's nice.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.431
Have you been to other
colon hygienists

10:57.556 --> 10:59.366
or is this your first colonic?

10:59.534 --> 11:02.160
- This is my first.
- Well, don't be scared.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.041
It will be a good experience for you,
I promise.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.028
I am going to find
all your treasures.

11:20.343 --> 11:21.926
The world is completely melting,

11:22.051 --> 11:24.454
and yet beautiful women
are still being produced.

11:25.996 --> 11:28.466
It's the one positive
in these preapocalyptic times.

11:28.591 --> 11:30.391
I need to find a bathroom.

11:31.118 --> 11:34.769
{\I think }Some of that water that he pumped
inside me needs to get out.

11:35.388 --> 11:37.853
Don't you feel any relief,
any sense of lightness?

11:37.978 --> 11:39.561
No, I feel worse.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.491
I'm probably a hard case...

11:41.981 --> 11:45.162
all those gyros
rotting in my intestines.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.167
I'd love to detoxify.

11:47.447 --> 11:49.902
I think I'll use the money
from my new case for a colonic.

11:50.027 --> 11:52.082
I don't want to hear
about the detective stuff{\ right now}.

11:52.207 --> 11:54.207
I just want to find a commode.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.132
Do you want me
to rub your shoulders or something?

11:58.489 --> 12:00.795
Not on the subway.
Jesus.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.889
It's bad enough that yusef
thought you were my partner.

12:08.529 --> 12:11.679
If we were lovers
who do you think would be the top?

12:14.073 --> 12:16.401
I'm bigger than you,
so clearly I'm the top.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.129
I don't want to talk about this{\ right now, though}.

12:18.254 --> 12:20.564
Yeah, but sometimes
the little guy could be the top...

12:20.689 --> 12:22.458
like a dog that herds cattle.

12:22.869 --> 12:24.598
You would be the cow

12:25.267 --> 12:28.455
and I would be that little dog
just barking at you...

12:31.417 --> 12:33.578
Did you get stoned while
I was getting my colonic?

12:35.481 --> 12:37.005
- A little.
- Oh, God,

12:37.173 --> 12:38.223
here we go.

12:38.796 --> 12:39.996
You all right?

12:40.540 --> 12:41.540
It's okay.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.703
We're almost home.

12:44.465 --> 12:45.972
We're almost home.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.637
<i>This is Suzanne.
Please leave a message.</i>

13:34.862 --> 13:37.391
Hi, I just want to let you
know that I'm shopping.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.301
{\I don't know, }Maybe I'm changing.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.767
Buddhism says that if a man
walks across a room

13:41.892 --> 13:44.014
he comes back a different person.

13:44.139 --> 13:46.399
So anyways, I'm sorry
to bring this up,

13:47.047 --> 13:50.120
but you forgot the box of love notes
and I had a couple of new ones.

13:50.479 --> 13:51.300
So...

13:51.664 --> 13:53.811
I don't know, maybe I could...

13:54.843 --> 13:56.043
bring them by?

13:56.484 --> 13:57.384
Anyways,

13:59.199 --> 14:00.399
I do Miss you.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.615
This is Jonathan.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.797
Can I exercise just for tonight,

14:49.922 --> 14:51.451
like a day pass?

15:15.829 --> 15:17.129
Damn, she's hot.

15:18.764 --> 15:19.587
What?

15:19.863 --> 15:22.045
Did you see that redhead,
that little friend in the pink?

15:23.175 --> 15:24.175
No, sorry.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.969
Oh my god.
Hey, man, look at that stretching area.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.971
I can almost understand the muslims

15:31.139 --> 15:32.825
wanting to keep women separate.

15:34.774 --> 15:37.070
I'm not really following you.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.478
It's like a Lamaze class over there.

15:39.603 --> 15:42.482
Are we supposed to just sit here
like a couple of eunuchs and watch?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.900
It's unnatural.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.569
Listen, I'm trying to exercise.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.988
- I don't have that much time.
- Sorry.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.991
You're a really good biker.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.911
Can I ask you a quick question?

15:57.106 --> 16:00.282
I'm writing an article...
a man-on-the-street sort of thing.

16:01.081 --> 16:03.753
What upsets you most about what's
happening with the environment?

16:05.316 --> 16:07.416
That's actually a good question.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.688
When I was a kid I grew up on a pond

16:10.813 --> 16:13.253
and we used to ice-skate
every winter.

16:13.378 --> 16:15.015
And now the pond never freezes over.

16:16.304 --> 16:17.304
I'm sorry.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.122
Sorry to keep bothering you, but is this
a good place to pick up women?

16:22.247 --> 16:24.594
It's kind of what I look for
in a gym.

16:24.885 --> 16:27.155
{\I don't know, }Have you ever picked up anyone here?

16:27.280 --> 16:28.777
- Nope.
- Really?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.265
Listen, I just want to ride my bike.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.408
If you could pick up
someone here, would you?

16:34.070 --> 16:35.994
I have a girlfriend,
so I don't think about it.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.756
{\Really?}You don't even think about it?

16:37.881 --> 16:39.848
Does that mean you haven't
cheated on her,

16:39.973 --> 16:42.626
like not just once you had
sex with another woman

16:42.794 --> 16:45.297
- and maybe used a condom...?
- Nice talking to you.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.488
Thank you.
Goodbye.

16:50.822 --> 16:52.427
- See you in the showers.
- Yeah.

17:11.553 --> 17:14.415
Excuse me, do you know
what's going on inside there?

17:14.540 --> 17:16.300
Is it like a church singles group?

17:16.425 --> 17:18.372
- It's an al-anon meeting.
- Al-anon?

17:18.497 --> 17:20.497
Right.
That's for relatives of alcoholics?

17:20.665 --> 17:22.221
Yeah, or friends of alcoholics.

17:22.346 --> 17:24.836
{\Okay, great. }Thank you very much.
You've been very helpful.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.354
I don't mean to be insensitive,

17:27.479 --> 17:30.131
but do you know a good bar around
here I could kill some time?

17:31.238 --> 17:32.700
Excuse me one second.

17:35.726 --> 17:37.698
- Hello, George.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

17:37.823 --> 17:41.397
- I'm about to get a drink.
- <i>I need you to come over right now.</i>

17:41.992 --> 17:44.875
- You know, I really can't right now.
- You can have the drink here.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.777
I'm having a crisis.

17:51.059 --> 17:53.310
Oh my God, what the hell
happened to your lip?

17:53.435 --> 17:54.535
Just get in.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.685
Were you stung by a bee?

18:00.165 --> 18:02.080
Yes, a bee with herpes.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.291
That's herpes?
But yesterday you were fine.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.733
I know.
I don't know what happened.

18:07.858 --> 18:10.731
I was with you
and then I went and got a massage

18:11.215 --> 18:14.752
and I felt this kind of insane
gratitude for everything.

18:14.877 --> 18:17.137
It was practically religious.

18:17.412 --> 18:20.056
And then half an hour later
my lip exploded.

18:20.594 --> 18:22.395
I got tested spiritually...

18:23.005 --> 18:24.096
and I failed.

18:24.532 --> 18:27.063
That's the biggest herpes blister
I've ever seen in my life.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.940
Thank you.
We're very proud of it.

18:29.162 --> 18:31.067
I kind of wish that thing
was a bee sting.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.068
God.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.237
You know all the bees
are dying, right?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.973
It's one of the depressing things
somebody told me for this article,

18:37.098 --> 18:38.450
- thank you{\ very much}.
- Listen.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.620
I don't care about the environment.
Right now my entire focus is on my lip.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.609
I cannot go out into the world

18:44.734 --> 18:47.798
and I have to give a speech
at the public theater in two hours.

18:47.923 --> 18:50.253
- Is there any medication that helps?
- No, not really.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.713
That's why I called you{\ over here}.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.077
Now I want you to hit me
in the mouth and the face.

18:56.949 --> 18:59.804
That's crazy. How will my hitting you
heal your blister?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.633
No, it won't heal it,
but the herpes will be obscured

19:02.758 --> 19:05.737
and I can claim
that I was sparring at the gym

19:05.862 --> 19:07.520
and things got out of control.

19:07.913 --> 19:08.759
Right?

19:09.275 --> 19:11.897
I was watching TV and I got the idea.
<i>Fight club</i> was on.

19:12.022 --> 19:13.568
I don't think I can hit you.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.270
Yes, you can.
{\Come on, }What are you...?

19:15.395 --> 19:17.197
Yes, you can.
Just get angry with me.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.784
I'm not good with anger.
I go straight to depression.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.014
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'll be Brad Pitt

19:23.139 --> 19:24.579
and you can be Edward Norton.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.134
You said yesterday
that we were in two different movies.

19:27.259 --> 19:29.662
Don't be a wiseass, will you?
This is an emergency.

19:29.787 --> 19:31.968
Now stand up
and smack me like a man.

19:34.365 --> 19:36.573
Thank you.
For crying out loud.

19:37.924 --> 19:39.124
Wait a minute.

19:42.189 --> 19:43.991
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

19:44.116 --> 19:47.493
but is it possible that if I hit you
I might get a herpes on my hand?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.295
Man, I never considered that.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.720
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
I shouldn't...

19:57.738 --> 19:58.609
here.

19:58.914 --> 20:00.826
The maid uses these to clean.

20:02.178 --> 20:04.300
Here you go.
Now you know how to hit somebody?

20:04.425 --> 20:07.009
You gotta put your hip into it.
Let me show you.

20:07.134 --> 20:10.208
{\You }Spin the right foot like you're putting
out a cigarette butt or something,

20:10.422 --> 20:12.870
like that, right?
You just... there, see?

20:13.371 --> 20:15.380
Now don't... don't look...

20:15.548 --> 20:17.825
all right, never mind.
Just hit me.

20:19.949 --> 20:22.362
This is {\kind of }an intimate moment.
I've never hit anybody before.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.806
Stop talking and hit me{\,will you, please?}.
Get it over with.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.224
- {\Are you }Ready?
- I said stop...

20:34.406 --> 20:35.801
I'm sorry, man.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.597
I took that israeli army
defense class once.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.143
I guess the old muscle memory
clicked in.

20:43.785 --> 20:47.036
- I think you crushed one.
- Now you have a hell of a right.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.914
- You should hit people more often.
- Thank you.

20:50.448 --> 20:52.394
Do you think
you got one more in you?

20:53.201 --> 20:54.752
Yeah, I can do one more.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.130
Hello, Ray. I'm freaking out.
I am freaking out right now.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.340
What's going on?

21:40.610 --> 21:43.259
I'm in Manhattan
and I'm following Suzanne

21:43.427 --> 21:45.219
and she's with the{\ really handsome} guy from my case.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.431
- {\What, }Are you stalking Suzanne?{\You can't do that.}
- <i>I'm not stalking her.</i>

21:48.599 --> 21:50.314
I'm on my case,
but the guy I'm following

21:50.439 --> 21:52.199
met up with Suzanne
at an al-anon meeting.

21:52.324 --> 21:53.978
{\I didn't even see her go in, but }They've left together.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.272
What the hell are you talking about?

21:56.440 --> 21:58.603
Suzanne is with another man.

21:58.893 --> 22:00.026
Do I confront her?

22:00.194 --> 22:03.696
Listen to me. Do not confront.
Repeat: do not confront.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.170
<i>Get back to Brooklyn.
Get on a train, get back.</i>

22:07.085 --> 22:08.826
God, they're going into a diner.

22:21.034 --> 22:22.981
Don't touch my girlfriend's hand.

22:25.016 --> 22:28.262
What are you doing here? I'm not
your girlfriend anymore, by the way.

22:28.613 --> 22:30.086
Wait, are you stalking me?

22:30.704 --> 22:33.709
You're still my girlfriend in my heart.
And I'm not stalking.

22:33.834 --> 22:37.355
I was walking by this place.
I look inside and I see {\the two of }you making out.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.389
What?

22:38.514 --> 22:40.900
- You reek of pot.
- I don't reek of pot.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.603
I was walking by these kids
and their pot got on me.

22:43.728 --> 22:44.821
You know it wafts.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.532
- You followed me, right?
- Why are you making out with this guy?

22:48.081 --> 22:50.811
Making out with him?
I wasn't making out with him.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.204
He was consoling me about you.

22:53.522 --> 22:55.122
We're al-anon friends.

22:55.247 --> 22:56.874
Why are you going to al-anon?

22:57.192 --> 22:59.377
- Because of you.
- You followed me.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.198
But I'm not an alcoholic.
Your father's an alcoholic.

23:02.323 --> 23:05.425
- Don't bring my father into this.
- Let's get out of here. He's nuts.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.058
What? Excuse me,
there's no hand holding here.

23:08.183 --> 23:09.804
You don't want to go out with him.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.056
I know he's well-endowed,
but he's a metamucil addict.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.367
- What?
- Yeah, he's a metamucil addict.

23:14.492 --> 23:16.436
What the hell are you talking about?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.730
You are a freak.
You followed me into the gym.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.466
I thought you were a nice guy.
I liked your story about the pond,

23:21.591 --> 23:24.777
- but I'm not gonna use it now.
- You're stalking both of us?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.608
And how do you know
he's well-endowed?

23:26.733 --> 23:29.333
Because... forget that I said that.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.390
I am not stalking anyone.

23:31.515 --> 23:33.186
I am in love with you.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.417
Leave now or I'm calling the cops.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.082
Listen, you leave now,
Mr. Constipated,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.217
so I can please sit
and talk to my girlfriend.

23:40.342 --> 23:43.153
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Get out of here.

23:45.907 --> 23:47.701
Okay, now we're even, even Steven.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.460
Suzanne, listen to me...

23:56.668 --> 23:57.924
You know what?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.120
Let's just get out of here.

24:02.218 --> 24:03.518
No hand holding!

24:07.263 --> 24:08.789
He has a girlfriend!

24:17.022 --> 24:18.498
What happened?

24:19.041 --> 24:21.060
Another domestic case,

24:21.392 --> 24:23.336
troubles of my business,
no big deal.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.701
- Are you sure? Do you want some ice?
- It's fine.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.341
It's fine.
So I have your report for you.

24:33.086 --> 24:35.433
I don't think your boyfriend
is cheating on you.

24:35.621 --> 24:38.474
He goes to the gym
and he hardly looks at other women.

24:38.599 --> 24:41.729
And then after the gym
he's going to al-anon meetings.

24:42.220 --> 24:44.732
So that's what your boyfriend
is doing at night...

24:45.252 --> 24:47.352
he's going to a 12-step program.

24:47.634 --> 24:48.569
Al-anon?

24:50.285 --> 24:53.427
- {\I guess }It's better than another woman, right?
- Yeah, I guess it's better.

24:53.552 --> 24:56.244
I mean, if he's going to al-anon,
that means he really loves me.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.372
A club soda, please.

25:01.444 --> 25:02.844
What do I owe you?

25:03.877 --> 25:05.510
You know, you don't have to...

25:06.018 --> 25:07.964
100 bucks, no expenses.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.717
I have to just say this...

25:12.426 --> 25:14.846
I really hope things work out
with you and your boyfriend,

25:15.213 --> 25:17.932
but if they don't,
you can always call me,

25:18.300 --> 25:19.400
'cause, hey,

25:20.806 --> 25:22.549
I don't mind a woman who drinks.

25:27.703 --> 25:28.776
You're sweet.

25:32.848 --> 25:34.315
- It's Gary.
- Gary?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.927
- I should {\probably }get this.
- Are you sure you want to take it?

25:37.052 --> 25:39.196
Maybe you shouldn't talk tonight.
{\Maybe }Wait till tomorrow.

25:39.321 --> 25:41.640
- Maybe he spotted me following him.
- Hi, Gary.

25:56.773 --> 25:58.865
... and then I asked her
for 100 bucks.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.785
At least I'll get a colonic
out of this whole mess.

26:02.437 --> 26:03.889
Do you think {\the guy told his girlfriend}he told her,

26:04.014 --> 26:05.972
then they{\ got into a} fight
and she put two and two together?

26:06.097 --> 26:07.047
Probably.

26:08.614 --> 26:11.098
Look, I'm sorry
that you got hit in the face

26:11.223 --> 26:13.466
and I'm sorry that Suzanne
thinks that you're insane,

26:13.591 --> 26:16.445
but I told you that this was gonna
blow up in your face, did I not?

26:17.490 --> 26:20.661
- Remember that?
- {\Hold on. }I gotta take this. It's George.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.956
Have you seen <i>The New York Post</i> ?

26:25.002 --> 26:27.429
Nobody believed
that I had a fat lip.

26:27.554 --> 26:29.295
They all knew it was herpes.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.011
<i>You shouldn't have hit me.</i>

26:31.136 --> 26:32.840
- But that was your idea.
- <i>Well,</i>

26:33.008 --> 26:34.842
you need to know
when to give me good advice,

26:34.967 --> 26:36.177
and that was bad advice.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.804
You need to be sane when I'm insane.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.774
- But I didn't know you were insane.
- Well, you should have.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.602
Please, no cell phones in my office.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.231
I have to go.
I'm about to get a colonic.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.399
What?
I want a colonic.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.974
So I have both of you today.
I'm glad.

26:54.352 --> 26:56.072
Early-morning colonics are the best.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.823
They're most cleansing.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.090
A lovers' quarrel?

27:06.421 --> 27:07.571
More or less.

27:08.305 --> 27:14.207
