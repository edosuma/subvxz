07:23.292 --> 07:26.291
It felt so familiar.

07:26.292 --> 07:28.083
- Yeah.
- It was the first time

07:28.125 --> 07:29.542
in a long time

07:29.583 --> 07:32.124
that Mike and Jessica were

07:32.125 --> 07:34.583
in the same group as we were

07:34.625 --> 07:37.083
and they didn't look angry

07:37.125 --> 07:38.457
and upset.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.688
- Mm-hmm.

07:39.689 --> 07:40.917
- And it was really nice.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.291
Come in.

07:43.292 --> 07:44.457
- Did you say "come in?"

07:44.458 --> 07:46.000
- Hi.
- Mm-hmm.

07:46.003 --> 07:47.333
- First of all, that's for him.
- What up, girl?

07:47.336 --> 07:48.833
- And then this is because
- you're gonna feed me

07:48.875 --> 07:50.750
- and I...
- Merce, are you crazy?

07:50.792 --> 07:52.042
- I hand-picked.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.000
- I love you,
- you look beautiful.

07:55.003 --> 07:56.500
[Speaking Farsi]

07:56.542 --> 07:58.250
- You look amazing,
- I love your shoes.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.750
- Okay, raise a glass.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.021
What's everybody else having?

08:02.022 --> 08:03.250
- Cheers, my love.

08:03.292 --> 08:04.583
- You guys, I don't even know

08:04.625 --> 08:05.999
if I'm sober from last night

08:06.000 --> 08:07.499
but let's turn up.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.625
- Let's have a drink.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
- So, mj.

08:12.001 --> 08:13.000
- Yes, darling?

08:13.001 --> 08:14.667
- I have to share
- with you something

08:14.670 --> 08:16.125
that I've been saving

08:16.126 --> 08:17.583
for a moment

08:17.625 --> 08:19.500
when I have you both with me.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.000
The other day,

08:21.042 --> 08:22.332
I mentioned to Asa

08:22.333 --> 08:24.167
that I would love for her

08:24.208 --> 08:26.167
to be ordained,

08:27.375 --> 08:29.707
so she could officiate

08:29.708 --> 08:31.000
at my wedding.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.208
This is what I had envisioned,

08:34.250 --> 08:36.207
not everyone has seen my house

08:36.208 --> 08:37.208
in palm Springs.

08:37.209 --> 08:38.209
- Okay.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.792
- So, I was thinking of planning

08:40.833 --> 08:42.958
a little palm Springs weekend,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.374
me, you,

08:44.375 --> 08:46.458
Asa, Adam.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.875
Go for lunch.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.667
- Listening.
- Okay.

08:50.708 --> 08:51.771
- Glowing.

08:51.772 --> 08:52.833
- And out of the blue,

08:52.875 --> 08:54.021
flash mob style...

08:54.022 --> 08:55.167
- Okay.

08:55.208 --> 08:58.042
- Our little impromptu meal

08:58.083 --> 08:59.792
turns into a wedding

08:59.833 --> 09:02.207
because Asa's now ordained,

09:02.208 --> 09:04.042
we have the ceremony

09:04.083 --> 09:05.458
and we go out

09:05.459 --> 09:06.833
and have a great night.

09:08.750 --> 09:09.875
- No.

09:12.625 --> 09:13.833
I'm like macaulay culkin

09:13.875 --> 09:15.042
in home alone.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.750
Like, I am so not

09:18.792 --> 09:20.042
into this plan.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.667
No, it's his thing, too, dude.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.333
- I don't think
- Adam's gonna be mad.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.979
- No, babe.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.583
He wants a marriage. Rez?

09:28.625 --> 09:30.021
- I think it's romantic.

09:30.022 --> 09:31.416
- It's not, it's a mutual thing,

09:31.417 --> 09:32.563
you know.

09:32.564 --> 09:33.708
Adam is the bride.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.583
- And he's the man
- of the f... ing household,

09:35.586 --> 09:36.813
Reza is.

09:36.814 --> 09:38.042
- He should not be excluded

09:38.083 --> 09:39.250
from the process.

09:39.292 --> 09:40.833
Now that you feel ready,

09:40.875 --> 09:43.167
it shouldn't be just your thing.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.833
He's wanted

09:44.875 --> 09:47.083
for it to be a... an us thing.

09:47.125 --> 09:48.938
I think

09:48.939 --> 09:50.750
it's an underwhelming solution

09:50.792 --> 09:53.124
for standing somebody up

09:53.125 --> 09:55.625
a year ago, I'm sorry.

09:55.667 --> 09:56.957
- I appreciate the fact

09:56.958 --> 09:58.875
- that you're looking out for Adam
- and you want him

09:58.917 --> 09:59.958
- to have a voice.
- And you.

09:59.961 --> 10:01.458
- But you also have
- to understand

10:01.500 --> 10:02.583
that there's certain things

10:02.625 --> 10:04.457
that he and I have discussed

10:04.458 --> 10:05.958
and things that we want

10:06.000 --> 10:07.958
for our life together

10:08.000 --> 10:09.750
that you don't know about.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.792
- The wounds
- between Reza and Adam

10:14.833 --> 10:16.458
have not yet healed

10:16.500 --> 10:17.791
and I really want them

10:17.792 --> 10:19.624
to feel healed

10:19.625 --> 10:20.625
from the wedding

10:20.626 --> 10:21.625
that was called off,

10:21.626 --> 10:23.292
before the next wedding.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.417
- This is a beautiful,
- happy occasion the two of them

10:25.458 --> 10:26.458
- have been waiting for.
- Yeah.

10:26.461 --> 10:28.291
- They're finally there.

10:28.292 --> 10:29.709
Let's rejoice,

10:29.710 --> 10:31.125
let's have a little toast to it.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.166
Okay, let's have a drink.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.667
- Yeah.
- Our boy's ready.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.625
- Coming up...
- Sometimes, I just have

10:38.667 --> 10:40.125
to second guess what's going on

10:40.167 --> 10:41.333
- and I don't wanna have
- to second guess.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.917
- Adam talks
- about getting married

10:42.958 --> 10:43.999
all the time

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
and now he's done a 180.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.666
- Ziggs,

10:59.667 --> 11:01.500
how excited are we?

11:01.542 --> 11:02.832
Come here, gorgeous.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.125
Come here, little one.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.583
Come here, little one.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.792
Come on, ziggs.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.499
Come on in, don't be shy. Hi.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.333
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- I'm mj, nice to meet you.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.167
- Alicia.
- This is Ziggy.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.542
- Hi, Ziggy.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.708
- Ziggy needs a summer cut

11:16.750 --> 11:17.813
and color.

11:17.814 --> 11:18.874
- Okay, how...

11:18.875 --> 11:20.792
- But we want something
- really outrageous.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.667
Ziggy is my mom's dog.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.207
When my mom summers

11:24.208 --> 11:25.542
in Europe,

11:25.583 --> 11:26.707
Ziggy stays with me.

11:26.708 --> 11:27.875
She's very delicate

11:27.917 --> 11:29.167
and there we go.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.208
As my mom says,

11:30.250 --> 11:31.707
Ziggy's my sister.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.125
She's a little bit nervous.

11:33.167 --> 11:34.874
But I get the critical side,

11:34.875 --> 11:37.374
Ziggy gets the stays at home

11:37.375 --> 11:40.167
and bakes cookies for her dog.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.958
- I brought a little bit
- of an inspiration

11:42.000 --> 11:43.167
for the color

11:43.208 --> 11:44.625
- because I think
- that maybe we could do

11:44.667 --> 11:46.333
- like, a little leopard.
- Okay.

11:46.375 --> 11:47.834
- If these are all

11:47.835 --> 11:49.292
of Ziggy's paws,

11:49.333 --> 11:50.771
then maybe

11:50.772 --> 11:52.208
that can be splash of color.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.375
- Okay.
- Okay,

11:53.378 --> 11:54.896
it's gonna have

11:54.897 --> 11:56.417
to be hot pink and black.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.583
You know,

11:57.584 --> 11:58.708
those shades of a cheetah.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.167
- Yeah.
- Which, my mom

12:00.208 --> 12:01.917
has always wanted a pet cheetah.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.000
I mean, we're doing her right,

12:05.042 --> 12:06.583
- I think she's...
- Wants to be different

12:06.586 --> 12:07.896
and honestly,

12:07.897 --> 12:09.208
pink is her favorite color.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.917
I know that about you, I do.

12:11.958 --> 12:13.250
Your mommy's

12:13.251 --> 12:14.542
gonna be really excited.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.583
- Come on, baby.
- Here you go, here you go.

12:15.586 --> 12:16.750
- Hi, sweetheart.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.542
- The last thing
- is just to make sure

12:19.583 --> 12:21.229
that the part

12:21.230 --> 12:22.875
around her poop hole.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.250
- Okay, yeah, I'll do...

12:24.251 --> 12:25.583
- My mom is also, she says

12:25.625 --> 12:28.417
you have to protect her pussy.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.916
When Ziggy walks away from you,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.417
her labia majora

12:32.458 --> 12:34.167
will fully show and be exposed

12:34.208 --> 12:36.875
if they cut her around there.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.021
So, my mom instructed me

12:38.022 --> 12:39.125
to make sure

12:39.167 --> 12:42.457
we do not trim her pussy hair.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.208
Full Bush for modesty

12:44.250 --> 12:45.875
and fully shaven anus

12:45.917 --> 12:47.958
for sanitary reasons.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.250
Thank you, I'm so excited.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.583
- Alright.
- I'll see you in a little.

12:50.625 --> 12:51.917
- Okay, bye.

12:51.918 --> 12:53.208
Holy crap, oh my god.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.750
[Music playing]

13:11.458 --> 13:13.125
- [Speaking Farsi]

13:13.167 --> 13:14.583
- Hello.
- Salam.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.959
- Salam.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.292
- [Speaking Farsi]

13:17.333 --> 13:19.000
- What's that?
- Hey.

13:19.042 --> 13:20.271
- Hey.

13:20.272 --> 13:21.500
- It's a new shipment.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.000
- The dresses?
- Yeah.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.417
- [Inaudible] Kaftans are here.
- The smell, what is that?

13:24.458 --> 13:26.000
- Mashti, we can't go
- through this every day.

13:26.042 --> 13:27.666
- What smell again?

13:27.667 --> 13:29.167
- It's so funky...

13:29.208 --> 13:30.583
- Hey.
- It's not funky,

13:30.625 --> 13:32.625
- it's beautiful frankincense.
- Let's make some money.

13:32.667 --> 13:33.750
- Good morning to you, too.

13:33.751 --> 13:34.832
Let's do it.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.750
Asa kaftans has been exploding,

13:36.792 --> 13:38.292
I've had to hire more people

13:38.333 --> 13:39.833
- and obviously,
- my dad and my brother

13:39.875 --> 13:41.125
were my first choices.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.333
- They're in
- the shipping department

13:42.336 --> 13:44.167
- and they kind of like,
- run the warehouse.

13:44.170 --> 13:45.458
- No room here.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.832
- I know, you guys.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.583
- It's...
- It's getting too crowded here.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.250
- We need storage.

13:50.292 --> 13:51.438
- Well, right now,

13:51.439 --> 13:52.583
this fridge is your storage.

13:52.625 --> 13:53.792
- Yeah.

13:53.793 --> 13:54.958
- It's like, the freezer.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.750
It's terrible.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.958
- No room.

13:59.375 --> 14:01.292
- But you know what?
- It's never been this bad

14:01.333 --> 14:02.354
because we just received

14:02.355 --> 14:03.375
all the inventory

14:03.417 --> 14:04.521
and we've never put

14:04.522 --> 14:05.625
in such a big order.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.208
- Notice, every time
- we put an order,

14:07.211 --> 14:08.958
- it's been like triple,
- triple, triple?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.375
- Yeah.
- So, now we're...

14:10.378 --> 14:12.541
- Everything is experience.

14:12.542 --> 14:13.542
We can calculate

14:13.583 --> 14:15.541
and find out what we need.

14:15.542 --> 14:17.000
- This business basically

14:17.001 --> 14:18.458
bankrolls all of our lives.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.875
- How many orders
- did we have today?

14:19.917 --> 14:22.542
- It's 30, 32 or 33.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.958
- And also, my dad doesn't have

14:23.959 --> 14:25.333
a retirement plan.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.542
When you're an immigrant,

14:26.543 --> 14:27.707
you don't have the same

14:27.708 --> 14:30.000
kind of like, 401k type stuff,

14:30.042 --> 14:31.417
so I have to set up

14:31.418 --> 14:32.792
the future for my family.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.042
- That puts like, the extra layer
- of pressure on it.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.458
- Do you wanna sit down
- for a second?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.458
- We have to talk
- about the shipping.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.542
- With the jewelry,
- there's mistakes in shipping.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.417
- Yeah.
- If it's wrong,

14:42.420 --> 14:44.667
we have to send them a label,

14:44.708 --> 14:46.417
that's another $8.00,

14:46.458 --> 14:47.542
right?

14:47.583 --> 14:48.583
And they have to send it back,

14:48.625 --> 14:50.083
that's another $8.00.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.208
So...

14:52.750 --> 14:55.167
- The thought
- of a family business is amazing

14:55.208 --> 14:56.292
but literally,

15:28.189 --> 15:29.375
so much riding on this thing

18:58.667 --> 18:59.667

19:00.875 --> 19:03.000
- of the same sort of argument,
- a dialogue.

- spent time...

19:14.670 --> 19:16.083
that's a huge bug.

- Mj's my girl and I don't
- really know her man that well,

19:19.708 --> 19:21.667
- so I thought it would be cute
- to have them over.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.167
- Plus, I'm gonna get
- a cake for mj

19:23.170 --> 19:24.667
- because her birthday
- was last week,

19:24.708 --> 19:25.999
which she ignores.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.167
- Do you feel like
- you protect Reza

19:27.208 --> 19:29.083
- or he protects you,
- or you protect each other?

19:29.125 --> 19:30.625
- He would put me
- in harm's way

19:30.667 --> 19:31.833
- to get himself
- out of harm's way.

19:31.836 --> 19:32.958
- No, he wouldn't.
- He's like,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.167
"i gotta protect the gold.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.707
Sorry, honey."

19:35.708 --> 19:37.333

- how's everything?

19:37.375 --> 19:39.042
- I do want he and i
- to move forward together

19:39.045 --> 19:40.188
but it's like,

19:40.189 --> 19:41.333
just because he's ready now

19:41.375 --> 19:43.041
doesn't mean that I'm ready to...

19:43.042 --> 19:44.667
To go forward.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.874
- But isn't that what you want?

19:45.875 --> 19:47.042
- It is what I want

19:47.083 --> 19:48.875
but last year,

19:48.917 --> 19:50.500
I also wanted something,

19:51.875 --> 19:53.125
and because of his actions,

19:53.167 --> 19:54.250
that kind of messed me up

19:54.251 --> 19:55.333
in the head.

How do I know if one morning,

19:56.417 --> 19:57.792
he's just gonna call it quits?

19:58.875 --> 20:00.250
it's super valid

- wedding being called last year,

I feel like

20:09.272 --> 20:10.667

20:12.043 --> 20:13.375

20:19.875 --> 20:21.749
what happened last year.

and communicate, you know?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.167

- like he always wants
- what he wants.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.375
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.208
- what do I want?
- Mm-hmm.

In a perfect world,

20:35.250 --> 20:37.582

He makes me very hesitant

20:49.208 --> 20:51.249
and nervous to move forward,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.375
so...

20:52.417 --> 20:55.708
- So, what do you want from him?

20:55.750 --> 20:58.291

20:58.292 --> 20:59.957
move to the next level,

21:57.667 --> 21:59.500
that we are just friends.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.167
- Like "three's company,"
- I understand.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.417
- Persian daughters

22:02.418 --> 22:03.625
are taught early on

22:03.667 --> 22:05.250
that when you meet a guy,

22:05.292 --> 22:06.917
- you don't run
- and tell your parents

22:06.958 --> 22:08.313
that you've met a guy

22:08.314 --> 22:09.666
and that you're dating.

22:09.667 --> 22:10.999
You're so bad.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.063
Now that I know

22:12.064 --> 22:13.125
I'm serious with Tommy,

22:13.167 --> 22:14.666
it's time to tell my mom.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.833
- Did you guys
- get a chance to...

22:15.875 --> 22:17.333
- No, [Inaudible]
- Pick out a wine?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.999
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.792
- I think that I can order
- some apps.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.771
For sure, crab cakes,

22:22.772 --> 22:24.707
baked brie sounds amazing

22:24.708 --> 22:26.458
and the calamari.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.667
- Sure, you got it.

22:28.833 --> 22:29.938
- Is she here?

22:29.939 --> 22:31.041
- Yes, she is.

22:31.042 --> 22:32.250
- Mommy.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.833
You look so beautiful.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.042
Hi, mommy-joon.

22:37.043 --> 22:38.207
- How are you?

22:38.208 --> 22:39.375
- Hi, tom, how are you?
- Hi, vida, how are you,

22:39.417 --> 22:40.792
how was your trip?

22:40.833 --> 22:42.500
- Fine, thank you.

22:42.542 --> 22:43.833
[Speaking Farsi]

22:43.875 --> 22:45.667
- What do you think about Ziggy?

22:46.875 --> 22:48.374
- She doesn't like dress,

22:48.375 --> 22:49.854
she doesn't even need...

22:49.855 --> 22:51.333
Oh my god.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.375
- Oh my god.
- She didn't see it at first.

22:53.417 --> 22:54.542
- Oh my god.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.875
Oh my god.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.958
Oh my god, the tail.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.167
Oh my god.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.707
How could you do such a thing?

23:02.708 --> 23:04.916
- Mommy.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.542
- In persian culture,

23:06.583 --> 23:08.583
if somebody lend you something,

23:08.625 --> 23:10.000
you take good care of it

23:10.042 --> 23:11.125
and give it back

23:11.126 --> 23:12.208
exactly same way.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.750
I don't give you

23:13.751 --> 23:15.249
a beautiful white dog

23:15.250 --> 23:16.584
and you turn

23:16.585 --> 23:17.916
into the purple tiger

23:17.917 --> 23:19.500
and give it back to me.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.542
Tommy, she is like my baby,

23:21.583 --> 23:23.750
she's not supposed to be funny.

23:23.792 --> 23:24.834
- She's a lady,

23:24.835 --> 23:25.875
ladies love attention.

23:25.917 --> 23:27.416
- I think you should see her

23:27.417 --> 23:28.833
and be happy to see her.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.667
- It's hair, it grows.
- She loves it.

23:30.708 --> 23:33.708
- [Speaking Farsi]

23:37.583 --> 23:39.500
- Oh my gosh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.083
- Do you guys need
- anything else right now?

23:41.125 --> 23:42.542
- No, no, my dear.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.916
- Alright, enjoy.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.500
- Oh my gosh.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.624
You're looking at me thinking

23:52.625 --> 23:54.624
that I'm chaagh.

23:54.625 --> 23:56.250
- [Speaking Farsi]

23:59.125 --> 24:00.208
- No.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.250
- [Speaking Farsi]

24:05.125 --> 24:06.875
- The biggest enigma about vida

24:06.917 --> 24:09.124
is that her intentions are good.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.458
She wants the best for me,

24:10.500 --> 24:12.708
even while she's churning

24:12.750 --> 24:14.791
and destroying my soul.

24:14.792 --> 24:16.250
- Tommy, you like to eat

24:16.292 --> 24:17.457
and then...

24:17.458 --> 24:20.291
You are a bad example for her.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.292
- But your daughter

24:21.293 --> 24:22.292
looks fantastic.

24:22.293 --> 24:23.957
Believe me, I... I'm fine

24:23.958 --> 24:25.208
with how she looks.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.499
- I'm not fine

24:26.500 --> 24:28.458
and it's not about you, Tommy.

24:30.167 --> 24:31.958
What are you, I mean.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.792
- You know,
- when I first met Tommy,

24:33.833 --> 24:35.250
I thought that it was a fling

24:35.292 --> 24:36.521
and then after

24:36.522 --> 24:37.750
a couple of months,

24:37.792 --> 24:39.146
I realized that it was more than

24:39.147 --> 24:40.500
just as a friend

24:40.542 --> 24:42.000
and I think that,

24:42.001 --> 24:43.458
hopefully, he's worth it.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.167
- I don't see

24:47.168 --> 24:48.542
a very positive thing.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.146
Any mother who wants the best

24:51.147 --> 24:52.500
for her daughter

24:52.542 --> 24:54.999
has to guide her.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.209
American culture

24:56.210 --> 24:57.417
and persian culture

24:57.458 --> 24:59.166
are very different.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.500
If you're a persian mother,

25:00.542 --> 25:03.750
your job is everyday going on.

25:03.792 --> 25:05.000
- Yeah but vida, in my defense,

25:05.042 --> 25:06.355
you have a very pessimistic

25:06.356 --> 25:07.667
outlook on love.

25:07.708 --> 25:09.833
- You're her mother,
- you're not gonna marry her.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.959
- I am so proud of Tommy

25:12.960 --> 25:14.874
for having this strength

25:14.875 --> 25:16.875
- and spirit
- and being able to stand up

25:16.878 --> 25:18.207
to vida, even.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.167
- If I had the money,
- I'd marry her,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.167
- there would already be a ring
- on her finger.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.958
I love your daughter to death.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.250
I hope to one day

25:25.251 --> 25:26.500
prove enough to you

25:26.542 --> 25:28.708
- that you know that she's made
- the right decision

25:28.711 --> 25:30.541
but I encourage you to hold me

25:30.542 --> 25:32.333
- to a higher standard.
- Give him a chance.

25:32.375 --> 25:33.542
- It keeps me
- on my toes, baby.

25:33.545 --> 25:35.208
- Give him a chance.
- It keeps me on my toes,

25:35.250 --> 25:36.375
- that's all I care about.
- Yeah, your toes.

25:36.417 --> 25:37.958
- You deserve
- to have the best, you do.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.042
- Right.
- He's not,

25:39.045 --> 25:40.541
he's not a good match for you.

25:40.542 --> 25:42.375
- You haven't gotten a chance
- to get to know him.

25:42.378 --> 25:45.207
- But I can tell that he's not,

25:45.208 --> 25:46.541
I can tell.

25:46.542 --> 25:48.041
This is a gift I have,

25:48.042 --> 25:49.375
I can tell right away.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.375
- Mom, that's not fair.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.582
- That's not fair?

25:52.583 --> 25:54.042
Fair, what fair has to do

25:54.083 --> 25:55.749
with the reality?

25:55.750 --> 25:57.082
- I'm in love,

25:57.083 --> 25:58.749
vida can deal with it.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.167
Let's go somewhere else.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.582
If she needs a map,

26:01.583 --> 26:03.417
Tommy and I can make her one

26:03.458 --> 26:05.208
- and at the end
- of the treasure map

26:05.250 --> 26:06.667
will be me and Tommy

26:06.668 --> 26:08.083
living happily ever after.

26:08.125 --> 26:11.167
- [Speaking Farsi]

26:16.875 --> 26:18.208
- Coming up...
- You and I

26:18.250 --> 26:19.917
are horrible with money.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.250
- What's gonna happen
- when I'm pregnant

26:21.253 --> 26:22.875
and have a baby?

26:22.917 --> 26:24.542
Am I gonna be going to work?

26:36.292 --> 26:37.542
- Are you tired of juice yet?

26:37.583 --> 26:39.958
- F..., I hate juice.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.917
- It's so good for you, babe.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.583
Hi, what do you have

26:43.625 --> 26:45.125
- that will help fill him up
- a little bit,

26:45.167 --> 26:46.292
but is still good for you?

26:46.333 --> 26:47.958
- The vegan protein smoothie
- or power bar.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.624
- Okay, I'm gonna get iv-cado.

26:50.625 --> 26:51.958
- Anything else for you?
- That's it.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.750
- So your total
- is $27.50 please.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.083
- Thank you.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.333
- Look what I took.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.438
- Jerk.

27:00.439 --> 27:02.250
- Hey, a $27.50

27:02.292 --> 27:03.458
for f... ing juice,

27:03.500 --> 27:05.125
- I wanna go back
- and take 10 more.

27:05.128 --> 27:06.625
- You're really stealing straws,

27:06.667 --> 27:08.458
- babe?
- Yes, straws are expensive.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.542
- You're crazy.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.500
- Thank you.
- That's what $11.00 juice

27:13.542 --> 27:14.667
- looks like, huh?
- That's it.

27:14.670 --> 27:15.750
- I like it.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.999
- Speaking of $11.00 juice...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.250
- You bought another juicer?

27:19.292 --> 27:20.542
- No, I have realized

27:20.543 --> 27:21.792
since we've been married,

27:21.833 --> 27:23.500
you and I are horrible

27:23.501 --> 27:25.167
with money, horrible.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.438
We go to get a house

27:26.439 --> 27:27.666
and we can't get approved.

27:27.667 --> 27:28.792
In the next six months,

27:28.793 --> 27:29.917
we are buying a home

27:29.958 --> 27:31.166
or at least in the process

27:31.167 --> 27:33.250
- of buying a home.
- Six months, huh, okay, yes.

27:33.292 --> 27:34.832
- If that can happen,

27:34.833 --> 27:36.667
- everything else
- will fall into place.

27:36.670 --> 27:37.730
- I'm still paying

27:37.731 --> 27:38.792
for the repercussions

27:38.833 --> 27:40.332
of the housing bubble

27:40.333 --> 27:41.666
and when I was flipping homes.

27:41.667 --> 27:42.917
I got caught

27:42.918 --> 27:44.166
with multiple properties

27:44.167 --> 27:45.250
when the economy

27:45.251 --> 27:46.333
took a downturn.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.521
Now I'm getting f... ed out

27:47.522 --> 27:48.666
of loans

27:48.667 --> 27:50.167
because that sh... takes forever

27:50.208 --> 27:51.500
to come off your credit.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.167
- Right now, I'm also working,

27:53.208 --> 27:54.542
so we're bringing in...

27:54.543 --> 27:55.874
It's a double income home

27:55.875 --> 27:57.542
- but what's gonna happen
- when I'm pregnant

27:57.545 --> 27:59.207
and have a baby?

27:59.208 --> 28:00.874
Am I gonna be going to work?

28:00.875 --> 28:02.207
- I don't want you to.

28:02.208 --> 28:03.542
Finances for newlyweds

28:03.583 --> 28:06.458
is f... ing hell.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.667
- It's just our spending habits
- are f... ing insane.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.667
- We're spending
- a few hundred dollars a week

28:10.708 --> 28:12.541
just on target.

28:12.542 --> 28:13.792
Target.

28:13.833 --> 28:14.833
These are the things

28:14.834 --> 28:15.834
that are bleeding us dry.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.542
- Like buying stuff,
- not wearing it

28:17.545 --> 28:18.625
and not returning it

28:18.626 --> 28:19.708
or not shopping

28:19.750 --> 28:21.207
for the best dry cleaner

28:21.208 --> 28:22.771
but finding one that...

28:22.772 --> 28:24.333
That is a little less expensive.

28:24.375 --> 28:25.459
Just got done paying

28:25.460 --> 28:26.542
for a f... ing huge wedding,

28:26.583 --> 28:28.542
- you're still paying
- that sh... off.

28:28.545 --> 28:30.042
You're trying to get ahead,

28:30.083 --> 28:31.458
hopefully wanna buy a house.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.667
You're talking about children,

28:32.708 --> 28:34.542
- all the sh...
- Costs a lot of money.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.733
- So, what's been happening
- with the new business

28:35.775 --> 28:36.900
with Eddie?

28:36.942 --> 28:38.275
- It has to work

28:38.276 --> 28:39.608
because if it works

28:40.817 --> 28:42.067
and we create

28:42.068 --> 28:43.317
a dope shoe line together

28:43.358 --> 28:44.483
and who better than me?

28:44.525 --> 28:45.983
- I mean, how many pairs
- of shoes do I have?

28:45.986 --> 28:48.900
I'm a shoe f... ing freak.

28:48.942 --> 28:50.317
- Are you sure
- that it's gonna be something

28:50.320 --> 28:52.650
- that's worth it though,
- we're investing this much money?

28:52.692 --> 28:54.442
- At the end of the day,
- I'm a hustler

28:55.817 --> 28:57.149
and I'm a deal-maker

28:57.150 --> 28:58.817
and if I don't take this risk,

28:58.858 --> 29:00.088
we're gonna be stagnant

29:00.089 --> 29:01.316
in our lives.

29:01.317 --> 29:03.650
If it hits, this shoe company,

29:03.692 --> 29:06.649
whew, it's gonna be big money.

29:06.650 --> 29:08.982
Jessica just has to sit back,

29:08.983 --> 29:10.982
enjoy the ride, be my support

29:10.983 --> 29:13.150
- and together,
- we're gonna build an empire.

29:13.192 --> 29:15.150
- I need to know that you're gonna
- f... ing ride with me

29:15.192 --> 29:16.755
and be there

29:16.756 --> 29:18.317
in case it's either,

29:18.358 --> 29:20.191
you know,

29:20.192 --> 29:22.817
