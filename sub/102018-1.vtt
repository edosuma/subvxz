WEBVTT

00:33.843 --> 00:35.645
Here we go.

00:36.579 --> 00:37.880
Right.

00:46.656 --> 00:49.659
You guys know
where I was this afternoon?

00:49.692 --> 00:52.795
Did I tell you?
The proctologist.

00:52.829 --> 00:55.898
My doctor sent me to have
a proctologist examination.

00:57.366 --> 00:58.735
They got an inverted chair

00:58.768 --> 01:02.571
that tilts up,
with stirrups, right,

01:02.605 --> 01:04.874
gives them a better
look at your asshole.

01:04.907 --> 01:07.275
So while I'm sitting there,
looking at this thing,

01:07.309 --> 01:08.611
right, this nurse comes in.

01:08.645 --> 01:12.481
She pulls out
a tube of lubricant,

01:12.514 --> 01:14.651
right, out of her uniform.

01:14.684 --> 01:15.852
She takes it out,

01:15.885 --> 01:17.920
she squirts a little bit
on her finger,

01:17.954 --> 01:19.454
make sure
it's coming out all right,

01:19.488 --> 01:20.690
and she lays that
on the table,

01:20.723 --> 01:22.892
right next
to the shiny instruments.

01:22.925 --> 01:25.193
Starting to get nervous.

01:25.227 --> 01:27.329
So she comes over to me...

01:27.362 --> 01:29.932
and she says, "If you go ahead
and slip out of your trousers

01:29.966 --> 01:31.668
"and your fucking underwear,

01:31.701 --> 01:33.535
"the doctor will be
with you in a minute."

01:35.938 --> 01:37.874
So she goes and walks
towards the door,

01:37.907 --> 01:39.876
she stops all of a sudden,
she looks me in the eye,

01:39.909 --> 01:42.511
and she says,
"Relaxation is the key."

01:42.544 --> 01:43.412
And I'm like, "What?"

01:43.445 --> 01:45.748
She's like,
"The more relaxed you are,

01:45.782 --> 01:47.617
"the quicker
we'll be out of here."

01:47.650 --> 01:49.317
So she fucking leaves.

01:49.351 --> 01:51.688
I'm looking at
this upside-down chair

01:51.721 --> 01:53.823
and these shiny
fucking instruments

01:53.856 --> 01:56.626
and this tube of lubricant,
and I'm like, "How the fuck

01:56.659 --> 01:58.895
"am I supposed to
relax myself in here, right?

01:58.928 --> 02:00.195
"What can I do?"

02:01.097 --> 02:03.231
You jerked off
in the doctor's office?

02:03.265 --> 02:05.635
You're goddamn...
I jerked the fuck off

02:05.668 --> 02:08.638
and put that shit in the
trash can under the desk.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.807
I did. I fucking did too.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.409
What if the nurse forgot one
of the instruments and came back in?

02:14.443 --> 02:17.714
Maybe she'd stick her pinky
up my butt, help me finish up.

02:17.747 --> 02:19.716
You're a dirty little
fuck, ain't ya?

02:20.917 --> 02:22.551
So, like, um...

02:22.585 --> 02:23.786
Like, how much money

02:23.820 --> 02:25.621
do you make
on a site like this?

02:25.655 --> 02:27.690
I've got 20 roofers
working up here.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.560
How many of 'em
really work up here?

02:33.562 --> 02:35.031
Maybe three?

02:36.498 --> 02:38.300
That shit is
easy money, right?

02:38.333 --> 02:40.335
Ain't no such thing
as easy money.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.337
You have no idea
what I had to do to get this.

02:43.806 --> 02:44.907
Hey, Peter!
What are you doing?

02:44.941 --> 02:46.676
You wanna piss
over the side?

02:50.412 --> 02:51.714
What the fuck?

02:54.717 --> 02:56.052
What the fuck?

02:56.085 --> 02:58.353
Holy fucking shit!

03:03.926 --> 03:05.460
Peter! Peter!

03:05.494 --> 03:07.429
What the fuck, man?
Are you all right?

03:08.197 --> 03:10.833
Don't worry,
not the first time.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.702
You could have
fucking killed yourself.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.307
Come on.

03:21.543 --> 03:23.579
What the fuck
did you do that for?

05:16.759 --> 05:17.994
Thanks for coming by.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.095
I appreciate it.

05:19.128 --> 05:21.931
It's those journalists that
I was telling you about.

05:21.964 --> 05:23.699
They found out that
the city employed

05:23.733 --> 05:25.968
some of my family members,

05:26.002 --> 05:28.671
and pretty soon those people
are all gonna be without a job.

05:28.704 --> 05:29.739
How many?

05:30.572 --> 05:31.707
Six.

05:34.143 --> 05:35.912
- He's gonna win.
- Who? Cruz?

05:35.945 --> 05:37.046
No, Trump.

05:38.981 --> 05:40.016
I'm serious.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.050
I'll vote for him.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.787
He made billions,
he can run this fucking country.

05:46.222 --> 05:48.224
Gentlemen, um...

05:48.257 --> 05:50.793
It'll be extremely helpful
to me if those people

05:50.826 --> 05:53.896
that I just mentioned
are viewed as, um,

05:53.930 --> 05:58.601
immediately employable
in some other avenues of life.

05:58.634 --> 06:01.436
Please tell me you ain't asking
me to make your mother a roofer?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.572
No, that's not
what I'm asking.

06:04.607 --> 06:06.474
Then what are you
asking me exactly?

06:06.508 --> 06:07.977
I don't know, um...

06:08.010 --> 06:09.477
Maybe you need
a new secretary.

06:12.248 --> 06:15.017
You give all the work
around here to companies

06:15.051 --> 06:16.752
employing roofers
that ain't union,

06:16.786 --> 06:19.055
but you're asking me
to help you?

06:26.295 --> 06:28.563
I want the pier at the
Delaware River waterfront.

06:30.299 --> 06:31.767
I can't do that.

06:31.801 --> 06:34.170
That's... That's impossible.

06:34.203 --> 06:36.205
Why?

06:39.742 --> 06:40.977
I think you know why.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.817
Go ask your Italian friends
to help your mama.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.618
Yeah?

06:55.257 --> 06:56.258
Where?

06:59.628 --> 07:00.963
What's going on?

07:04.767 --> 07:06.736
O'Meara is dead.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.823
What happened?

07:31.794 --> 07:33.229
Michael, what happened?

07:34.330 --> 07:36.732
Apparently some guys just
picked him up on the street.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.235
They what?

07:39.268 --> 07:40.703
These guys just picked him up
on the street,

07:40.736 --> 07:42.038
and he just gets
in the car with them.

07:42.071 --> 07:43.973
He don't even try
to run or anything.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.077
What the hell
is wrong with people?

07:49.745 --> 07:50.946
It's like they want to die.

07:51.914 --> 07:54.884
- He had kids, right?
- Yeah, three of them.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.819
His wife, she divorced him?

07:56.852 --> 07:58.621
Yeah, she left.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.090
We ought to take care of the kids for him.
But none for her.

08:02.224 --> 08:03.759
Not a fuckin' cent.

08:04.827 --> 08:06.796
We'll pay for the funeral.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.023
That kid is really good, man.

08:37.827 --> 08:39.695
Did you talk to his dad?

08:39.728 --> 08:41.130
He's a crackhead.

08:41.163 --> 08:42.998
The kid's stayin'
at my place.

09:11.193 --> 09:13.262
The question is,
who put him in the car?

09:17.066 --> 09:18.968
I don't fucking
know who did it.

09:19.001 --> 09:20.803
The guy just got killed.

09:25.975 --> 09:29.311
Well... I know we got to
respond to this in a way

09:29.345 --> 09:32.281
that it ain't gonna happen again.
I mean, that I can tell you.

09:32.314 --> 09:34.283
You don't know who,
you don't know why,

09:34.316 --> 09:35.951
and you want to go to war?

09:41.957 --> 09:45.227
Do you remember when
O'Meara got me my first lay?

09:45.261 --> 09:46.962
No.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.432
Day I turned 12,

09:50.466 --> 09:52.301
he let me baby-dick

09:52.334 --> 09:54.203
that hooker in the backseat
of his Caddy.

09:59.275 --> 10:04.013
Ahh, ahh, ahh!
You guys,

10:04.046 --> 10:06.849
look at what we've done
to this fucking place.

10:06.882 --> 10:08.484
Hey, I just
hired a new cook.

10:08.517 --> 10:10.986
Do you where he's from?
Paris, France.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.254
They eat fucking frogs
over there.

10:12.288 --> 10:16.025
No. Jesus Christ,
it's not that we're serving French food.

10:16.058 --> 10:18.194
Like I said, it's just that
the chef comes from France.

10:18.227 --> 10:20.996
- Fuck France.
- He says fuck France.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.266
Hey, look, you guys
remember Grace?

10:24.733 --> 10:26.869
What, your sister?

10:26.902 --> 10:28.270
- Grace.
- Yes.

10:28.304 --> 10:31.106
- Holy shit. Grace?
- Mmm-hmm. Yep.

10:32.441 --> 10:34.376
No fucking way.

10:34.410 --> 10:36.378
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you!

10:36.412 --> 10:38.347
Look at you! Shit!

10:38.380 --> 10:40.883
I thought you were...

10:40.916 --> 10:42.952
I thought you were living
down in Florida with your mom?

10:42.985 --> 10:45.154
Um, I was,
but I am going to Jefferson now.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.522
- Ah.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:46.555 --> 10:47.790
Grace is gonna
work at the bar

10:47.823 --> 10:49.325
and stay at my place
for a while.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.026
- Fantastic!
- Mmm-hmm.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.861
Look at you,
look how beautiful she is.

10:52.895 --> 10:55.130
Like no fucking way
she's your sister.

10:55.164 --> 10:57.266
Let's get some fucking
champagne or something...

10:57.299 --> 10:59.101
- Yeah!
- Let's celebrate.

10:59.134 --> 11:00.903
- Yes.
- Good job, Jimmy.

11:00.936 --> 11:02.404
Okay.
Know what I'm saying?

11:02.438 --> 11:04.807
Excited? Yeah,
I definitely am.

11:08.510 --> 11:11.113
That was really fucking good.
That was excellent.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.481
- Pretty good one, right?
- Yeah.

11:47.149 --> 11:49.985
Okay? Huh?

11:50.019 --> 11:51.920
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right, man.

11:51.954 --> 11:53.155
You good?

12:07.503 --> 12:08.937
Are you all right?

12:08.971 --> 12:10.406
Yeah, perfect

12:20.049 --> 12:22.619
Here. Let's go home.

12:22.652 --> 12:25.154
- One more drink.
- No, come on.

12:25.187 --> 12:26.522
It's late, let's...

12:26.555 --> 12:29.325
- Nah, I gotta have one more drink, Peter.
- Let's go home.

12:29.358 --> 12:32.261
You're a good guy,
just...

12:32.294 --> 12:34.229
You're a good guy,
your cousin too.

12:34.263 --> 12:36.532
He helped me out with the
restaurant and everything...

12:36.565 --> 12:39.068
- What do you mean?
- What?

12:39.101 --> 12:41.937
- What do you mean?
- Just trying to say thank you,

12:41.970 --> 12:43.640
that you helped me out
with the restaurant

12:43.673 --> 12:45.908
- and everything...
- No, no, no, no. Did you...

12:45.941 --> 12:49.311
Did you borrow money
from Michael? Did you?

12:51.180 --> 12:52.582
Because if you did,
don't sit around thinking

12:52.615 --> 12:54.450
it's gonna take care
of itself. It's not.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.518
It's not a friendly thing,
do you understand that?

12:56.552 --> 12:58.053
Hey, hold on a second,

12:58.087 --> 13:00.389
hold on a second,
we grew up together, right?

13:00.422 --> 13:02.558
What the fuck do you mean?
He's your cousin, man.

13:02.592 --> 13:04.326
Yeah, he's my...
Exactly, you said it.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.495
He's my cousin,
not yours.

13:08.197 --> 13:09.632
How much?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.168
I don't know.
I don't remember.

13:13.202 --> 13:16.238
You don't remember?
Well, he remembers everything.

13:16.271 --> 13:18.374
Don't get in too deep,
I'm telling you.

13:18.407 --> 13:19.975
Don't fuck with him.

13:22.144 --> 13:23.613
I only borrowed a little money
for the restaurant.

13:23.646 --> 13:25.114
I'm gonna pay him back soon.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.585
I am.

13:30.119 --> 13:32.287
It's not gonna be a problem.

13:32.321 --> 13:34.089
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

13:36.258 --> 13:39.361
Don't forget what I said.

13:39.395 --> 13:40.996
No, no, no, no.

13:42.431 --> 13:43.600
No, I know.

14:28.544 --> 14:30.045
Stop!

15:03.680 --> 15:05.314
The fuck...

15:07.817 --> 15:10.552
- Hello.
- <i>Peter, it's me.</i>

15:10.587 --> 15:12.689
Jimmy, I'm sleeping.

15:12.722 --> 15:14.423
<i>It's Michael. He got shot.</i>

15:14.456 --> 15:16.091
What?

15:16.124 --> 15:18.393
<i>They were waiting for him
in front of the restaurant.</i>

15:18.427 --> 15:20.429
<i>I wasn't there.
But Grace was, and she said...</i>

15:20.462 --> 15:22.231
Is he dead?

15:39.448 --> 15:42.017
- Where is he?
- In there.

15:43.452 --> 15:45.087
Go on in.

16:05.107 --> 16:07.577
Remember when we
got our first paychecks?

16:09.311 --> 16:11.547
And we got wasted
up on that roof?

16:14.784 --> 16:16.552
You jumped.

16:17.587 --> 16:19.555
Busted your tailbone.

16:21.156 --> 16:24.426
I thought you did it
to pick up a disability check,

16:24.459 --> 16:28.463
but you never missed
a day's work.

16:35.872 --> 16:37.607
Who did this?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.210
Michael?

16:46.749 --> 16:49.351
Bono's men.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.089
- Why?
- What don't you understand?

16:54.924 --> 16:57.392
The Italians killed O'Meara,

16:59.361 --> 17:00.897
and now
they're trying to do me.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.497
Why did they kill him?

17:02.531 --> 17:05.133
They want what we got.

17:06.468 --> 17:08.136
I need your help, Peter.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.475
If I'm gonna hold on to this,

17:15.712 --> 17:17.647
I gotta have somebody
I can trust.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.684
What, they want it all,
or they want a share?

17:21.718 --> 17:23.786
What's the fucking difference?

17:25.487 --> 17:27.255
Now it's a share,

17:27.289 --> 17:29.759
but tomorrow they'll take
everything from us.

17:30.693 --> 17:32.762
You know
we can't fight them.

17:32.795 --> 17:35.865
They want a share?
Just give it to them.

17:35.898 --> 17:38.433
We don't have to do
what they say anymore.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.772
- The streets belong to me.
- Michael listen to me.

17:44.674 --> 17:47.309
Your father made a deal
a long time ago.

17:48.778 --> 17:51.914
It's lasted so long that
everyone who made it is dead.

17:51.948 --> 17:54.416
And before him,
they killed McCullough,

17:54.449 --> 17:56.919
because he was fucking with
the Italians in Atlantic City.

17:59.589 --> 18:01.691
They realized that the jobs
are still a source of money

18:01.724 --> 18:03.826
and power in the city,

18:03.860 --> 18:06.328
and that you still control it.

18:06.361 --> 18:07.897
If you don't give them
what they want,

18:07.930 --> 18:10.667
- you know what's gonna happen.
- You have to be on my side.

18:12.534 --> 18:14.369
You're my brother.

18:15.504 --> 18:17.439
You're the only one
I can trust.

18:37.259 --> 18:38.527
What's going on?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.903
Come sit down.

18:46.936 --> 18:49.371
What the fuck is going on?

18:49.404 --> 18:51.573
- What are you all doing here?
- It's the baby.

18:53.542 --> 18:54.744
She...

18:57.980 --> 18:59.582
She got hit by a car.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.686
Look, it was nobody's fault.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.922
- The fucking guy's car slid...
- What guy?

19:07.790 --> 19:08.825
The neighbor.

19:10.425 --> 19:12.494
You mean Victor Kopec?
The cop?

19:14.931 --> 19:16.833
Charley! Charley, stop!
Charley!

19:16.866 --> 19:18.433
- Get off of me!
- No, no.

19:18.467 --> 19:19.869
Get the fuck off of me.
Let me go!

19:19.902 --> 19:22.404
Let me fucking go!
Get off!

19:30.545 --> 19:32.547
Now that's an excellent horse.

19:32.582 --> 19:34.449
There ain't nothing
wrong with her.

19:36.753 --> 19:39.354
It's got fucking
spaghetti legs.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.690
She's come from a long line

19:40.723 --> 19:41.791
of champions,
the bloodline...

19:41.824 --> 19:44.459
I don't give a fuck
where she comes from.

19:44.493 --> 19:45.895
Fuck that horse.

19:45.928 --> 19:47.764
- Mr. Flood...
- Fuck you!

19:53.401 --> 19:54.503
Can you believe
this motherfucker

19:54.536 --> 19:56.005
trying to sell me
a horse like that?

19:56.038 --> 19:57.774
Tell him I want a big horse.

19:57.807 --> 20:00.575
- That horse look big to you?
- Yeah, it's a racehorse.

20:02.912 --> 20:04.847
- That's a shit horse.
- No, it's a racehorse.

20:04.881 --> 20:07.482
That's a shit horse.
I can spot a champion when I see one,

20:07.516 --> 20:08.851
and that's a fucking
shit horse.

20:08.885 --> 20:10.485
What do you know
about horses?

20:10.519 --> 20:13.656
You like boxing?
I like horses.

20:16.525 --> 20:17.927
Whatever, man.

20:20.096 --> 20:22.899
Hey, that kid
Carlos is training...

20:22.932 --> 20:24.499
Jimmy tells me he's special.

20:26.468 --> 20:28.537
Jimmy doesn't know shit
about fighting.

20:28.570 --> 20:30.305
So is the kid good or not?

20:31.908 --> 20:33.810
Yeah, he's good enough.

20:33.843 --> 20:35.812
Maybe you talk to him,

20:35.845 --> 20:37.046
maybe we get him somewhere.

20:37.079 --> 20:39.514
- Get him somewhere?
- Hmm.

20:39.548 --> 20:40.616
He is good where he is.

20:40.650 --> 20:41.884
The kid could make
some money now,

20:41.918 --> 20:42.885
that ain't going
to last forever.

20:42.919 --> 20:44.821
That's all I'm saying.
Maybe you talk to him,

20:44.854 --> 20:45.988
let him know we help him.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.557
They don't need us
to make money.

20:48.591 --> 20:50.525
I told you,
he's good where he is.

20:53.763 --> 20:56.065
Relax.

20:56.098 --> 20:58.701
You talk about these guys like
they're family or something.

21:04.941 --> 21:07.009
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:08.778 --> 21:10.713
Can I get a beer?

21:14.016 --> 21:15.017
Yep.

21:19.421 --> 21:20.923
How's, uh...

21:20.957 --> 21:22.959
- How's Michael doing?
- He's all right.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.928
What about you?
Sounds like you were pretty close.

21:25.962 --> 21:27.630
I was still inside
closing up.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.001
I didn't hear the gunshot,
just heard people screaming.

21:38.540 --> 21:40.710
Jimmy told me you're working
for Michael now.

21:44.013 --> 21:46.849
- No, I'm just helping out.
- Doing what?

21:49.919 --> 21:51.721
Don't tell me
you're a roofer.

21:53.956 --> 21:56.491
You know what we do.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.427
Jimmy grew up with us.
It's not a secret.

21:59.461 --> 22:01.631
Taking over
the family business?

22:02.131 --> 22:03.633
Yeah, kind of.

22:03.666 --> 22:05.935
You know, when we were kids,

22:05.968 --> 22:08.170
I always thought that you were
different than your cousin.

23:04.226 --> 23:05.795
Oh, look at him go.

23:07.096 --> 23:10.733
Look, I know that in his mind,
he thinks he's a real boxer.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.601
He thinks that he can be
a world champion one day.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.073
Fucking give it up, Peter.
You look like dog shit.

23:19.241 --> 23:21.043
- How you are doing, Carlos?
- I'm okay.

23:25.114 --> 23:26.115
I was...

23:28.084 --> 23:29.785
I was wondering
if the kid was around.

23:29.819 --> 23:32.520
Maybe he could give my man
Lenny here a couple of rounds.

23:32.554 --> 23:34.256
He's run to Jersey
for some parts.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.992
He works for me now,
at the garage.

23:36.025 --> 23:37.994
Oh, to Jersey?

23:38.027 --> 23:39.862
He gonna come back,
or what, eh?

23:42.331 --> 23:43.833
Don't worry about him.

23:43.866 --> 23:46.035
He just wants to move
a few rounds with the kid.

23:48.671 --> 23:49.772
Just taking it real easy.

23:50.773 --> 23:52.041
What do you say, Carlos?

23:52.074 --> 23:53.275
I told you, he's in Jersey.

23:54.610 --> 23:55.945
Oh, shit, look at that.

23:56.912 --> 23:57.913
There he is.

23:59.181 --> 24:00.182
How you doing, Ryan?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.084
How was Jersey?

24:02.952 --> 24:04.253
What's the weather like
over there?

24:08.157 --> 24:09.825
How are you doing?
I've been hearing good things about you.

24:10.659 --> 24:11.660
You look strong.

24:12.628 --> 24:14.296
- What's your weight?
- 125.

24:14.330 --> 24:16.032
A buck twenty-five?

24:16.065 --> 24:19.235
What do you say you give my man
Lenny here a couple of rounds?

24:19.268 --> 24:20.603
I wanna see you guys move.

24:22.038 --> 24:23.239
Three rounds?

24:25.274 --> 24:27.977
Three, four, five.
Whatever you want.

24:28.878 --> 24:30.179
He said...

24:30.212 --> 24:32.948
He thinks
he can kick your ass.

24:32.982 --> 24:34.984
I don't think so.
I wanna see you work, kid.

24:35.017 --> 24:36.018
Come on. Let's go.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.087
Man, it's gonna be fun.

24:40.289 --> 24:42.058
Let's go.

24:45.061 --> 24:46.962
There's no
reason to do this, man.

24:48.931 --> 24:50.866
I wanna see the kid work,
that's the reason.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.234
You keep saying
how fucking good he is.

24:52.268 --> 24:53.669
I wanna see if he can fight.

24:54.804 --> 24:56.272
So why don't you come by
next week,

24:56.305 --> 24:57.572
and you can see him work?

24:57.606 --> 25:00.042
You don't have to bring in a
fucking monkey. It's insulting.

25:00.076 --> 25:03.045
So somebody's insulted.
So the fuck what?

25:05.381 --> 25:07.249
Hey, by the way,
where were you last night?

25:08.851 --> 25:09.885
At the restaurant.

25:10.419 --> 25:11.620
Oh, yeah?

25:13.022 --> 25:14.023
With Jimmy?

25:18.928 --> 25:20.229
Yo, check it out.
A fight.

25:20.262 --> 25:21.263
Yo, we gonna do this?

25:23.566 --> 25:25.367
All right.
Let's see what my monkey can do.

26:03.205 --> 26:04.673
Hey, he's
a buck twenty-five, Lenny.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.108
Touch him.

26:06.842 --> 26:08.744
Yeah. There it is.

26:17.987 --> 26:18.988
The fuck?

26:19.889 --> 26:21.223
What the fuck?

26:21.257 --> 26:22.892
What the fuck are you doing?

26:23.292 --> 26:24.827
Get the fuck up.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.328
Get... Wake the fuck up.

26:28.264 --> 26:29.431
He's, like, half your size.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.902
You let him knock you out
like that?

26:32.935 --> 26:34.436
You're right,
he's a fucking monkey.

26:34.470 --> 26:35.938
Get the fuck up.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.173
Get the fuck out of there.

26:37.206 --> 26:38.440
Get the fuck out of the ring.

26:40.409 --> 26:42.011
Get the fuck up, Lenny.
Get out of here.

26:42.545 --> 26:43.746
Don't bleed in my car.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.015
Be in touch, Ryan.

26:46.682 --> 26:48.851
Very nice. Very, very nice.

27:09.338 --> 27:10.339
Your dad here?

27:12.007 --> 27:13.008
Go get him.

27:26.855 --> 27:27.990
I told you
not to come in here.

27:29.091 --> 27:30.092
What do you want?

27:31.293 --> 27:32.294
Uncle Phil's here.

27:40.402 --> 27:41.971
So what are you doing here?

27:42.004 --> 27:44.173
The guy's
calling Constantine

27:44.206 --> 27:46.041
eleven times a day,
sayin' you're gonna do him.

27:46.075 --> 27:47.476
All right,
don't tell me you're comin' in here,

27:47.509 --> 27:48.578
telling me what I'm gonna do.

27:48.612 --> 27:50.012
No, I came to tell you
what you ain't going to do.

27:51.013 --> 27:54.216
He's helpin'
the Italians on some...

27:54.250 --> 27:55.384
On some things, Charley.

27:56.085 --> 27:58.554
Constantine don't want him hurt.

27:58.588 --> 28:01.790
There's lots of cops
helpin' him on some things.

28:01.824 --> 28:04.393
How come this one's
got to move in next door,

28:04.426 --> 28:07.229
in an Irish neighborhood,
the place where we grew up,

28:07.263 --> 28:08.364
and drive his
big old convertible

28:08.397 --> 28:11.233
up and down the street
like some Center City pimp?

28:13.302 --> 28:15.037
The guy took my baby, Phil!

28:17.439 --> 28:18.874
He took my baby.

28:20.175 --> 28:22.044
It was an accident.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.846
Constantine don't want
the guy touched.

28:23.879 --> 28:25.481
Yeah, well, fuck Constantine!

28:25.514 --> 28:28.050
And fuck the Italians.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.119
First they're in our business,
now they're in my house?

28:30.152 --> 28:31.220
The man skidded.

28:32.388 --> 28:34.390
If it was something else,

28:34.423 --> 28:36.593
I'd have taken care of him myself,
right there, that afternoon.

28:36.626 --> 28:38.861
You know what? You can get
the fuck out of here!

28:59.616 --> 29:00.816
Dad?

29:02.885 --> 29:03.886
Go to bed.

29:17.667 --> 29:20.603
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Peter, it's Bono.</i>

29:20.637 --> 29:23.439
<i>I understand you've got medical
problems in the family...</i>

29:23.472 --> 29:27.276
- Yeah, what do you want?
- <i>Maybe we should talk about it.</i>

29:27.309 --> 29:29.545
<i>Or you might be thinking of
takin' over the business.</i>

29:31.280 --> 29:32.881
<i>So maybe we can
work something out.</i>

29:34.450 --> 29:35.951
<i>Think about it and call me.</i>

29:58.407 --> 29:59.408
Who's this guy?

30:20.597 --> 30:21.598
I gotta talk to you.

30:36.445 --> 30:38.547
Sometimes I wonder what the
fuck I need you for in the first place.

30:39.515 --> 30:41.016
I get shot, you're not around.

30:42.184 --> 30:44.353
I come up to Carlos',
and you act like

30:44.386 --> 30:45.921
you're ashamed we're cousins.

30:47.423 --> 30:49.158
What are all these knuckleheads
doing out here?

30:51.761 --> 30:53.663
- We're making a move.
- You're making a move?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.365
Well, they tried to do me.

30:56.398 --> 30:57.667
We're not just gonna do
one of them.

30:57.700 --> 31:00.102
We're going to end this fuckin'
thing, that's what's next.

31:00.135 --> 31:02.705
But the Italians have been around
for, like, what, a hundred years?

31:02.739 --> 31:04.239
And you're gonna end it?

31:04.273 --> 31:06.609
This is Philly, everything
in this fuckin' city's

31:06.643 --> 31:08.043
been around for a hundred years.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.278
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

31:11.246 --> 31:13.282
I'm turning them loose.

31:13.315 --> 31:14.684
Turn them loose? These guys?

31:14.717 --> 31:15.718
Mmm-hmm.

31:17.486 --> 31:19.388
The only way to do that

31:19.421 --> 31:22.357
is when you tell them exactly
what it is you want them to do.

31:22.391 --> 31:24.761
And then you promise them
that you'll cut off their hand

31:24.794 --> 31:27.262
if they do it in any other way.
You hear me?

31:27.296 --> 31:30.065
And maybe,
maybe if you're lucky,

31:31.634 --> 31:34.069
you'll only get jammed up
half of the time.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.370
But we ain't jammed up.

31:35.404 --> 31:36.405
You're not?

31:38.340 --> 31:39.508
We know who did O'Meara.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.449
I'm telling you...

31:48.685 --> 31:50.419
You put these guys
on the street,

31:50.452 --> 31:52.187
I'm out. I'm going to Hawaii.

31:54.624 --> 31:56.058
You want them off the street?

31:57.594 --> 31:59.328
Then you take care of business
with me.

32:03.165 --> 32:04.333
Or go to fucking Hawaii,

32:05.768 --> 32:06.769
and don't come back.

33:00.522 --> 33:01.658
Pour that one out, please.

33:03.225 --> 33:04.226
Why?

33:05.394 --> 33:07.129
Somebody died.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.531
Pour it.

33:33.422 --> 33:34.624
So, what happened to
your mother...

33:37.292 --> 33:39.161
She got scared of things
that wasn't there.

33:42.264 --> 33:44.132
First, she wouldn't go out
by herself,

33:45.802 --> 33:47.569
then she wouldn't go out
even if I was with her.

33:49.438 --> 33:52.207
Then, finally, it scared her
so bad that

33:52.240 --> 33:54.142
she's afraid to even move
her little finger.

33:56.545 --> 33:58.447
She thinks if she moves
her little finger,

34:00.750 --> 34:01.818
it wakes up,

34:03.385 --> 34:05.387
and remembers
what happened to your sister.

34:06.656 --> 34:09.157
She thinks if she just keeps
everything still,

34:09.892 --> 34:11.126
it don't hurt.

34:13.395 --> 34:14.396
I wanna see her.

34:18.601 --> 34:20.637
It ain't the kind of hospital
you can visit her.

35:15.792 --> 35:16.859
They, uh...

35:18.995 --> 35:20.930
They wouldn't let me
get my dogs.

35:25.968 --> 35:28.671
Who'd... Who would want to
burn up a couple little dogs?

35:54.831 --> 35:56.833
- Let's take your shoes off.
- Okay.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.835
Okay.

36:15.918 --> 36:16.919
He was there.

36:20.322 --> 36:21.591
He was there when it happened.

36:32.602 --> 36:34.604
Listen, they're not
looking for Jimmy.

36:37.974 --> 36:39.274
You're safe, don't worry.

36:40.109 --> 36:41.309
Don't worry.

36:45.047 --> 36:46.381
Peter, what's going on?

36:47.817 --> 36:50.987
Oh...

36:57.927 --> 36:59.494
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,
what are you doing?

36:59.528 --> 37:01.631
Come on, get up. Get up.

37:01.664 --> 37:03.065
Get up.

37:03.099 --> 37:04.867
Get up.

37:04.901 --> 37:06.769
Come on.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.771
They wouldn't let me
get the dogs.

37:08.805 --> 37:10.907
I told them,

37:10.940 --> 37:13.542
"I don't care
what you do,

37:13.575 --> 37:16.344
"just let me get my dogs
out of your way."

37:19.548 --> 37:21.416
I asked him,
the guy at the door.

37:23.552 --> 37:25.988
I said,
"Could I please have the dog?"

37:26.022 --> 37:27.723
And he wouldn't
answer me.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.460
And I can hear 'em
in the back,

37:32.494 --> 37:33.461
barking at the one
in the basement,

37:33.495 --> 37:35.530
but the guy at the door
wouldn't let me in.

37:46.809 --> 37:49.444
Here you go.

37:49.477 --> 37:52.480
Here you go.

38:04.559 --> 38:05.595
Tell me what happened.

38:06.162 --> 38:07.529
I told them,

38:07.562 --> 38:10.166
"it's none of my business
what you're doing,

38:10.199 --> 38:12.702
"just let get my dogs
out of there first."

38:12.735 --> 38:16.404
And he wouldn't answer me.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.407
And then...

38:19.441 --> 38:22.444
Only, I didn't want to
go in there.

38:22.477 --> 38:24.914
'Cause if I walk in there,
I'm dead, and...

38:27.016 --> 38:28.851
I ain't even got nothing
to do with this.

38:32.021 --> 38:34.556
And then, the one at the door

38:34.590 --> 38:37.994
said that I better, uh,
go call Michael,

38:38.027 --> 38:39.929
and tell him what's happening
to his place.

38:42.497 --> 38:44.166
I said, "It's my place.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.002
"It isn't Michael's."

38:46.035 --> 38:47.970
But he just says

38:48.004 --> 38:49.739
I better go back
across the street.

38:49.772 --> 38:52.975
So, I go call Michael,

38:54.542 --> 38:55.945
but then Leonard says
he's asleep.

38:57.013 --> 38:59.649
And then,
while I'm on the phone,

39:01.584 --> 39:03.119
I hear a noise.

39:03.152 --> 39:05.688
It sounds like somebody
blowing out a candle.

39:09.158 --> 39:10.626
And it shakes the house.

39:13.663 --> 39:15.463
And then,
when I looked out the window,

39:17.066 --> 39:19.101
the inside of the place
is already orange.

39:58.975 --> 40:00.643
The fuck you doing here, huh?

40:02.111 --> 40:03.679
I want to talk to Bono.

40:03.713 --> 40:05.547
I told you to call me,
not to come.

40:08.617 --> 40:09.685
Yeah, it's right here.

40:15.124 --> 40:16.125
Let's go.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.635
- Michael send you?
- No.

40:26.669 --> 40:28.738
What are you doing here?

40:28.771 --> 40:30.606
Shit's getting out of hand.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.540
Yeah, well,
he started it, not me.

40:33.275 --> 40:34.677
That's not what he said.

40:38.748 --> 40:39.782
Oh, yeah?

40:41.217 --> 40:43.819
O'Meara tried to extort my guys.

40:43.853 --> 40:45.221
I asked Michael
if he can fix it.

40:45.254 --> 40:47.089
Michael says sure,
he can fix it,

40:47.123 --> 40:49.025
but he don't do it.

40:49.058 --> 40:51.961
So I do a little investigation,
and guess what?

40:51.994 --> 40:53.662
Him and O'Meara are
working together.

40:55.664 --> 40:58.300
Trying to take
construction sites from us.

41:01.070 --> 41:03.205
So, you know, there's
three sides to every story,

41:03.239 --> 41:05.107
yours, mine, and the truth.

41:05.141 --> 41:07.143
And the truth is he's done,
he's gotta go.

41:09.879 --> 41:11.013
Is there any way

41:12.882 --> 41:13.983
We can just, you know...

41:16.152 --> 41:17.920
I mean, forget about all this?

41:17.953 --> 41:18.954
No.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.291
But you stand to make out.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.227
I'm gonna need somebody.

41:26.195 --> 41:27.830
You understand?

41:27.863 --> 41:29.765
I mean, I can't just
walk into the unions

41:29.799 --> 41:31.167
and announce they're under
new management.

41:32.935 --> 41:34.203
It's kind of hard for me to...

41:36.105 --> 41:37.706
For me to trust you,
you know that?

41:40.042 --> 41:42.645
Oh, no, Peter,
I liked your father.

41:42.678 --> 41:44.346
And Constantine
liked your father.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.148
Your father was a fuck-up.

41:50.019 --> 41:51.854
The real question here...

41:54.690 --> 41:56.659
Are you just another
stupid Irish fuck?

42:02.998 --> 42:04.100
You want a beer?

42:06.702 --> 42:07.736
Yeah.

42:13.375 --> 42:15.077
First thing about
drinking beer...

42:16.946 --> 42:19.682
Never take the cap off
with your teeth.

42:19.715 --> 42:21.417
It doesn't matter if all
your friends use their teeth.

42:21.450 --> 42:22.952
In the end,
they're gonna break one off.

42:24.019 --> 42:25.054
Wait and see.

42:28.991 --> 42:30.659
It's the same thing
as hittin' walls.

42:32.128 --> 42:35.297
Every Irish wedding
you go to,

42:35.331 --> 42:37.133
there's always gotta be
some guy hitting a wall.

42:42.872 --> 42:44.640
Your Uncle Phil was
a good wall puncher.

42:51.013 --> 42:54.083
The thing about that,
besides it's stupid,

42:54.116 --> 42:56.085
is you can't always tell
where the studs are.

42:58.721 --> 43:01.724
And, man, it's one thing to put
your fist through drywall,

43:03.959 --> 43:05.828
it's something else
when you hit the studs.

43:13.102 --> 43:15.671
There's no excuse for
hurting yourself on purpose.

43:18.941 --> 43:19.975
The Italians know that.

43:21.844 --> 43:22.845
Irish don't.

43:25.915 --> 43:27.149
It's why they run things,

43:28.918 --> 43:29.952
and why we don't.

43:34.757 --> 43:36.392
You like it?

43:36.425 --> 43:38.327
- No.
- Then don't drink it.

43:51.140 --> 43:52.141
Uncle Phil...

43:54.243 --> 43:55.344
I don't really like him.

43:57.313 --> 43:59.748
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.452
He's...

44:05.921 --> 44:07.423
He's fucked up.

44:15.564 --> 44:17.499
Jesus, that's too good.

44:23.472 --> 44:26.208
We take him down to the gallops this morning,

44:26.242 --> 44:27.876
trying to keep everybody happy,

44:27.910 --> 44:29.979
get him into shape
so he can race, like you said.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.215
I get the vet to take a picture.

44:34.049 --> 44:35.251
He broke a bone.

44:36.151 --> 44:38.354
It's not a bad break,
it's just that...

44:41.056 --> 44:44.493
The truth is,
it's not a very a sound horse.

44:44.526 --> 44:48.497
And sometimes it happens.

44:48.530 --> 44:51.567
What you're saying is this horse
that I bought for $80,000

44:51.601 --> 44:53.369
ain't really a racehorse.

44:53.402 --> 44:54.403
It's just...

44:55.204 --> 44:58.140
Horses' legs
are delicate things,

44:58.173 --> 45:00.142
and something happened.

45:00.175 --> 45:04.179
Maybe his breeding was bad,
maybe...

45:04.213 --> 45:06.382
I don't know, he's just
too fucking big.

45:07.216 --> 45:08.951
You think this is funny?

45:08.984 --> 45:10.552
It's too fucking big?

45:10.587 --> 45:13.889
It could be that, it could be
his father, his mother.

45:13.922 --> 45:15.524
You're supposed to shoot those fuckin' things, right?

45:15.557 --> 45:16.925
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

45:16.959 --> 45:18.327
Put that gun away.
Put that gun away.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.962
Get out of the way.

45:19.995 --> 45:21.430
- You're not...
- I own the fucking thing.

45:21.463 --> 45:22.766
You can't shoot the horse.

45:23.866 --> 45:26.535
As long as you have been
around here,

45:26.568 --> 45:27.704
have you ever seen somebody else
shoot their horse?

45:27.737 --> 45:29.538
You ever seen anyone else around
here that's got a horse

45:29.571 --> 45:31.340
that ain't a fucking horse?

45:31.373 --> 45:33.242
Lots of broken down
horses, Mr...

45:33.275 --> 45:36.845
You already talked, telling me
the horse is too big.

45:36.879 --> 45:38.080
My cousin's talking now,
telling me

45:38.113 --> 45:39.348
I can't shoot the motherfucker.

45:39.381 --> 45:41.283
When he's through telling me
what I can do,

45:41.317 --> 45:42.985
then it's your turn again.

45:43.620 --> 45:45.187
Put that gun away.

45:47.990 --> 45:49.558
Normally, they inject them.

45:50.893 --> 45:52.961
- With a needle?
- Yeah, nice and easy.

45:54.897 --> 45:56.298
Hmm.

45:57.900 --> 45:59.868
A needle. Go get it.

46:03.072 --> 46:04.907
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:08.911 --> 46:10.112
It's my horse.

46:23.459 --> 46:24.526
You the owner?

46:26.596 --> 46:27.930
Owner's signature.

46:42.712 --> 46:44.480
Come on, let's go.

46:44.513 --> 46:45.514
Hold him.

47:28.323 --> 47:34.196
That's... $240, please.

47:53.583 --> 47:56.485
You, uh, want me to have
somebody come get this?

48:00.690 --> 48:02.124
You want me to take care of it,

48:02.157 --> 48:03.660
or you want to have it
done yourself?

48:05.194 --> 48:06.395
I changed my mind.

48:13.469 --> 48:14.737
You hear what I said?

48:14.771 --> 48:17.039
- You said you...
- Michael...

48:18.273 --> 48:20.409
The horse is dead. Let's go.

48:20.743 --> 48:21.744
Come on.

48:22.579 --> 48:23.746
He's a big shot.

48:23.780 --> 48:26.114
You wanted him to put the horse
down, that's what he did.

48:26.148 --> 48:28.383
Come on, let's go, come on.
Hey.

48:28.417 --> 48:30.687
Hey, Leonard, gimme that bag.

48:34.389 --> 48:35.758
Since when do you decide?

48:36.759 --> 48:38.393
Ain't your horse.

48:42.064 --> 48:43.298
Ain't your business.

48:46.335 --> 48:48.403
Be careful
with that shit, Mr. Flood.

48:48.437 --> 48:50.807
If you got a cut or something
and that gets in,

48:50.840 --> 48:52.274
it doesn't take much.

48:52.307 --> 48:53.408
Like one drop of this...

48:53.442 --> 48:55.043
It gets in your bloodstream,
yeah.

48:56.278 --> 48:57.279
And if you put this
into a person...

48:57.312 --> 48:59.548
They'd be dead before
you could get it half in.

49:02.317 --> 49:03.653
So how much of this you got?

49:03.686 --> 49:04.754
How much you need?

49:06.522 --> 49:08.591
See, I like this guy better
already.

49:08.625 --> 49:09.692
Let's go.

49:09.726 --> 49:11.794
Come here. Let's... Let's go.

49:13.228 --> 49:14.463
I can have this one here?

49:14.496 --> 49:15.698
All you want.

49:15.732 --> 49:17.700
You don't, you don't mind if I take it?

49:17.734 --> 49:18.735
No, sir.

49:21.704 --> 49:22.739
Thank you.

49:25.207 --> 49:27.509
Sorry, you wanted to
ask me something, right?

49:27.543 --> 49:29.646
Uh, just about taking care
of your horse.

49:29.679 --> 49:31.648
If you wanted me to take care
of him for you.

49:33.282 --> 49:35.785
Yeah, I would appreciate
that very much.

49:35.818 --> 49:37.486
No problem,
I'll do it right now.

49:37.519 --> 49:39.488
But first...

49:39.521 --> 49:41.691
I want you to get
on your fucking knees

49:42.625 --> 49:44.059
and kiss him goodbye.

50:30.305 --> 50:31.440
Morning, Peter.

50:32.107 --> 50:34.109
Want to get in so we could talk?

50:35.945 --> 50:37.446
What do you want to talk about?

50:40.182 --> 50:42.685
Well, we heard a story.

50:42.719 --> 50:45.354
A veterinarian filed a complaint
against Michael.

50:45.387 --> 50:48.357
The vet said Michael made him
kiss a dead horse.

50:48.390 --> 50:50.325
Yeah, so what?

50:50.359 --> 50:52.394
Yeah, I can squash
the complaint.

50:52.427 --> 50:55.263
I'll even have my lawyer
draw up the papers,

50:55.297 --> 50:57.232
but what does that say
about your business?

50:57.265 --> 50:58.467
How much longer you think
before someone

50:58.500 --> 51:00.135
pulls it out from under you?

51:01.804 --> 51:05.207
You need help,
we could save it for you.

51:05.240 --> 51:07.175
It's gonna cost you though.

51:07.209 --> 51:08.645
You're gonna kill your brother.

51:12.247 --> 51:15.283
Well, he's not my brother,
he's my cousin.

51:15.317 --> 51:17.654
Oh, well, that makes it a lot
easier then, don't it?

51:19.254 --> 51:21.456
Either way, he's not where
he's at for long.

51:23.492 --> 51:25.695
Don't... I don't hear nothing.
Are you thinking about this?

51:25.728 --> 51:26.929
No, I'm not.

51:31.266 --> 51:32.367
Let me approach this
another way.

51:32.401 --> 51:34.871
Who do you think set up
your father to Constantine?

51:36.606 --> 51:39.776
Somebody wanted what he had,
someone wanted to be like him,

51:39.809 --> 51:41.611
wasn't tough enough
or respected enough

51:41.644 --> 51:42.712
and never would be.

51:43.146 --> 51:44.346
You got no clue?

51:45.748 --> 51:46.816
Your uncle.

51:49.919 --> 51:50.953
No way.

51:50.987 --> 51:52.889
I watched your uncle
bury your dad.

51:52.922 --> 51:55.290
See, I worked for Constantine
back in the day.

51:56.626 --> 51:58.795
I watched your uncle bash
your father's face in,

51:58.828 --> 51:59.862
over and over with the shovel,

51:59.896 --> 52:01.764
so he wouldn't be recognized
when they found him.

52:01.798 --> 52:03.298
Why are you telling me all this?

52:03.331 --> 52:04.867
Oh, so you'd realize
what Michael would do

52:04.901 --> 52:08.236
if he was standing right here
and I made him the same offer.

52:08.270 --> 52:10.272
You see, because
at the end of the day,

52:10.305 --> 52:11.808
he's still his father's son.

52:13.910 --> 52:15.812
You hear what I'm saying
to you, Petey?

52:15.845 --> 52:16.946
It's your move.

52:55.517 --> 52:56.786
What's going on?

53:03.593 --> 53:05.995
How long until Jimmy's
got a problem with Michael?

53:07.663 --> 53:09.431
What do you mean, a problem?

53:14.569 --> 53:16.371
For the money he owes him.

53:19.474 --> 53:20.810
Stay out of it.

53:20.843 --> 53:24.881
Don't you dare tell me
to stay out of it.

53:26.048 --> 53:28.316
Your cousin came
over here yesterday,

53:28.350 --> 53:30.452
put a fucking needle
to my brother's neck,

53:30.485 --> 53:34.456
and told him this is what
they use to fucking kill horses.

53:34.489 --> 53:38.393
Jimmy's restaurant burned down
because of Michael.

53:38.426 --> 53:39.929
First, Michael says
it's not his problem,

53:39.962 --> 53:43.065
now he's threatening
to kill him for $95,000.

53:43.099 --> 53:45.668
- There's nothing I can do.
- Of course you can,

53:45.701 --> 53:47.502
he's your cousin.

53:47.536 --> 53:48.805
Doesn't work like that.

53:49.872 --> 53:51.107
I told Jimmy, you know,

53:51.140 --> 53:53.709
not to get involved
with Michael.

53:53.743 --> 53:55.845
And now he owes him.
There's nothing I can do.

53:55.878 --> 53:56.879
Okay then.

53:58.446 --> 54:00.616
If you're not gonna do anything,

54:00.650 --> 54:01.818
I'll take care of it.

54:06.122 --> 54:07.455
What are you gonna do?

54:11.727 --> 54:13.328
You're gonna go to the cops?

54:16.464 --> 54:19.334
Just think about
what will happen.

54:25.775 --> 54:27.576
Exactly.

54:27.610 --> 54:29.145
Stay out of this.

54:29.178 --> 54:30.646
It's not your world.

54:36.118 --> 54:37.820
You're just like Michael,

54:39.822 --> 54:41.389
but I think you're worse.

54:42.792 --> 54:44.927
Because you're a fucking coward.

55:53.162 --> 55:54.964
The man that killed
your sister...

55:57.532 --> 55:58.834
I took care of him.

56:02.038 --> 56:04.539
It's gonna be all right now.
Come here.

56:17.687 --> 56:19.755
He came over in the
afternoon when I was out.

56:19.789 --> 56:22.959
Leonard and the kids just beat
the fucking shit out of him.

56:22.992 --> 56:24.126
Michael, what the fuck?

56:24.160 --> 56:26.262
I can't believe this happened.

56:27.562 --> 56:29.231
I told you
they were fucking idiots.

56:29.265 --> 56:30.833
Look at the guy.
Come on, look at him.

56:30.866 --> 56:32.001
He looks like a lawyer.

56:32.034 --> 56:33.501
Eh...

56:33.535 --> 56:35.738
How can they not spot
the difference? Come on.

56:37.039 --> 56:38.607
Why do you think they sent him?

56:40.810 --> 56:43.545
To fix your fuck-up with the
vet, like I told you.

56:44.747 --> 56:45.982
- I know.
- Look at this mess.

56:46.015 --> 56:47.049
I know.

56:47.083 --> 56:48.250
Fucking idiots!

56:53.756 --> 56:55.191
Call the fucking doctor.
Come on.

56:55.224 --> 56:56.759
- I mean, I...
- No, call him right now.

56:56.792 --> 56:58.060
I can't let the guy out of here.

56:58.094 --> 56:59.729
I mean, I got
no choice about that.

56:59.762 --> 57:02.231
The way they did him,
I mean, he's crippled.

57:05.835 --> 57:07.236
Maybe the guy just disappears.

57:08.104 --> 57:09.205
Oh, yeah.

57:10.606 --> 57:12.641
So you think
they don't know they sent him?

57:13.776 --> 57:15.277
We say he never got here.

57:17.847 --> 57:18.914
No.

57:18.948 --> 57:20.116
You know what you're gonna do?

57:20.149 --> 57:22.651
You're gonna pick up the phone
and you're gonna call them

57:22.685 --> 57:26.322
and tell them exactly
what the fuck happened.

57:26.355 --> 57:28.290
And you tell them that
your guys got too excited

57:28.324 --> 57:29.792
when he showed up at the door,

57:29.825 --> 57:31.260
and they beat him up.
They'll get it.

57:32.294 --> 57:33.662
They'll understand.

57:35.097 --> 57:36.298
And then you'll tell them

57:36.332 --> 57:38.934
that if they want the guys
who did it,

57:38.968 --> 57:41.904
that you will, you know?
You will give it to them.

57:41.937 --> 57:43.639
And they can do whatever
the fuck it is they want.

57:43.672 --> 57:45.741
They can break them,
they can burn them, whatever.

57:47.209 --> 57:48.911
Yeah.

57:48.944 --> 57:50.613
It's the only choice you got.

57:51.180 --> 57:52.715
Look at this mess.

57:56.719 --> 57:58.054
I'll help you with it.

57:58.421 --> 57:59.722
All right?

57:59.755 --> 58:01.057
I'll help you with it.

58:01.090 --> 58:02.591
I need a favor in return.

58:05.027 --> 58:06.295
Oh, yeah? What's that?

58:06.328 --> 58:08.597
Go easy on Jimmy
about the money.

58:08.631 --> 58:10.332
Jimmy, hmm?

58:10.366 --> 58:12.668
You've seen Jimmy
walk the streets, right?

58:13.769 --> 58:15.838
That means I went easy on him.

58:17.339 --> 58:19.008
Now he's got to come up with it.

58:19.041 --> 58:20.309
Man, come on.

58:20.342 --> 58:22.978
What happened to the restaurant
is not his fault.

58:23.012 --> 58:24.113
Fuck does that mean?
"His fault."

58:24.146 --> 58:25.247
You know what that means.
Come on, man,

58:25.281 --> 58:26.315
cut him some slack.

58:26.348 --> 58:27.683
He owes me money.

58:28.417 --> 58:29.618
I'll pay it.

58:30.019 --> 58:32.988
No. No.

58:33.022 --> 58:35.825
He needs to pay me back,

58:35.858 --> 58:37.893
and you need to mind
your own fucking business.

58:37.927 --> 58:39.795
All right, fine.

58:39.829 --> 58:41.664
You deal with this shit
all by yourself.

58:48.904 --> 58:50.139
All right.

58:53.042 --> 58:54.977
Just tell Jimmy to relax.

59:21.237 --> 59:22.271
Jimmy!

1:00:03.412 --> 1:00:04.413
Jimmy.

1:00:05.814 --> 1:00:07.016
Jimmy?

1:01:08.010 --> 1:01:09.011
He ain't here?

1:01:12.181 --> 1:01:14.350
How come you got it so dark?

1:01:14.383 --> 1:01:15.918
It doesn't matter to me.

1:01:15.951 --> 1:01:18.287
I think you spend
too much time alone.

1:01:24.460 --> 1:01:25.861
You come sit down?

1:01:57.226 --> 1:01:59.795
They said his head
was cut halfway off.

1:02:04.566 --> 1:02:06.502
They found him in the trunk
of his car.

1:02:07.637 --> 1:02:09.838
You can't tell
your old man nothing.

1:02:11.140 --> 1:02:13.909
Never could.

1:02:13.942 --> 1:02:16.445
He'll sit there, just like you,
listening to somebody

1:02:16.478 --> 1:02:17.980
as long as they want to talk,

1:02:18.013 --> 1:02:20.215
then go do exactly what
he was gonna do anyway.

1:02:24.019 --> 1:02:25.454
You supposed to be up?

1:02:26.455 --> 1:02:29.124
It's 9:30. You supposed
to stay up till 9:30?

1:02:29.992 --> 1:02:32.561
You're lucky.

1:02:32.595 --> 1:02:35.632
Your Aunt Theresa don't let
Michael stay up at all.

1:02:35.665 --> 1:02:37.900
Right after he has done
his schoolwork,

1:02:37.933 --> 1:02:39.201
he's up to his room.

1:02:46.375 --> 1:02:48.877
Your father's got
a nice house here.

1:02:51.547 --> 1:02:54.216
Nice park across the street.

1:02:54.249 --> 1:02:56.352
Dentists live in houses
like this.

1:02:58.655 --> 1:03:00.222
Hey, hey,
where are you going?

1:03:00.255 --> 1:03:01.890
It's him.

1:03:01.924 --> 1:03:04.259
He don't want you running
outside this time of the night.

1:03:04.493 --> 1:03:06.161
Hmm?

1:03:09.699 --> 1:03:11.467
Yo. Where you been?

1:03:13.202 --> 1:03:15.404
Did you get something to eat?

1:03:15.437 --> 1:03:17.973
All right, go on upstairs
and let me talk to your uncle.

1:03:19.141 --> 1:03:21.176
You didn't hear me or what?

1:03:21.210 --> 1:03:22.378
He's just like you.

1:03:23.212 --> 1:03:24.413
Doesn't listen.

1:03:25.682 --> 1:03:27.349
Go on.

1:03:27.383 --> 1:03:29.952
Don't let me catch you
sitting on the stairs listening.

1:03:40.630 --> 1:03:41.997
Go on.

1:03:50.305 --> 1:03:51.641
One, two.

1:03:51.674 --> 1:03:53.175
Jab.

1:03:53.208 --> 1:03:54.243
Jab.

1:03:54.276 --> 1:03:55.577
One, two.

1:04:02.151 --> 1:04:04.052
Work, Ryan, move, move.

1:04:34.116 --> 1:04:36.084
- Get in.
- What's going on?

1:04:39.689 --> 1:04:41.156
Come on, open the trunk.

1:04:41.190 --> 1:04:42.291
The trunk is full.

1:04:43.425 --> 1:04:44.993
What, you pop the lawyer?

1:04:45.027 --> 1:04:46.028
Get in.

1:05:05.214 --> 1:05:07.617
He was getting infected,
he was going delirious.

1:05:07.650 --> 1:05:09.786
He made so much noise I couldn't
even hang out in my own place.

1:05:09.819 --> 1:05:11.286
What am I supposed to do?

1:05:14.423 --> 1:05:17.359
There's no reason for us
to do this by ourselves, you know.

1:05:17.392 --> 1:05:19.629
The reason is, I want
to make sure it's done right.

1:05:21.163 --> 1:05:22.397
I know the place to do this.

1:05:22.431 --> 1:05:23.733
Oh, you know a place.

1:05:24.834 --> 1:05:26.034
What place?

1:05:28.303 --> 1:05:29.739
A place my father showed me.

1:05:39.481 --> 1:05:41.517
So what we're saying,
if it comes up...

1:05:43.285 --> 1:05:45.220
The guy was fine
when he left the house.

1:05:45.254 --> 1:05:46.421
That's it.

1:05:47.489 --> 1:05:48.457
See, there was a problem
with the way

1:05:48.490 --> 1:05:50.660
you wanted us to explain
to them what happened.

1:05:51.828 --> 1:05:53.529
The time.

1:05:53.562 --> 1:05:55.598
The longer it goes,
the worse it gets.

1:05:56.799 --> 1:05:57.767
The afternoon
when you came over,

1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:00.135
there's already been a day,
a day and a half.

1:06:00.168 --> 1:06:02.404
If I turn him over then,

1:06:02.437 --> 1:06:06.208
it looks like I decided
to do one thing and got scared,

1:06:06.241 --> 1:06:07.576
tried to do something else.

1:06:08.443 --> 1:06:10.078
It makes us look weak.

1:07:43.405 --> 1:07:45.742
I think you've
used this hole before.

1:07:45.775 --> 1:07:48.645
All of a sudden, I'm digging up
bones and shit like that.

1:07:58.353 --> 1:07:59.521
That's deep enough.

1:08:00.690 --> 1:08:01.824
Get out of there.

1:08:08.965 --> 1:08:10.399
It's deep enough.

1:08:12.735 --> 1:08:14.536
You know what
I was thinking?

1:08:15.605 --> 1:08:19.241
Maybe we give that kid
at the gym to the Italians.

1:08:19.274 --> 1:08:21.576
I'm sure they could make
a shit-ton of money with him.

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:26.348
Maybe it'll make them
forget about all this.

1:08:28.918 --> 1:08:30.820
Peter? What do you think?

1:08:58.313 --> 1:08:59.649
You're on your own now.

1:09:40.056 --> 1:09:43.926
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

1:10:04.013 --> 1:10:05.380
Thanks.

1:10:09.417 --> 1:10:10.452
Hey!

1:10:14.056 --> 1:10:15.725
I wanted to thank you

1:10:17.827 --> 1:10:19.461
for taking care for everything.

1:10:19.494 --> 1:10:20.797
Yeah, don't say that.

1:10:26.969 --> 1:10:28.604
Since you've called,

1:10:31.140 --> 1:10:32.608
nothing feels real.

1:10:38.748 --> 1:10:40.315
So what are you gonna do?

1:10:43.418 --> 1:10:45.755
I don't really know, I...

1:10:45.788 --> 1:10:47.522
I don't think
I want to stay here.

1:10:47.556 --> 1:10:49.826
It's his city, you know.

1:10:49.859 --> 1:10:51.326
I see him everywhere.

1:10:52.962 --> 1:10:54.429
Maybe Florida.

1:11:01.536 --> 1:11:03.405
All right then. Take care.

1:11:05.675 --> 1:11:07.043
Are you going somewhere?

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.148
<i>What are you gonna do now?</i>

1:11:12.181 --> 1:11:13.950
I don't know.

1:11:16.886 --> 1:11:18.054
I don't know.

1:11:27.462 --> 1:11:29.364
You should come visit me
in Florida.

1:11:40.009 --> 1:11:41.911
Yeah, I can do that.

1:11:44.981 --> 1:11:46.582
I can do that.

1:11:52.688 --> 1:11:54.489
So this is your parents' place?

1:11:55.825 --> 1:11:56.993
Yeah.

1:12:00.897 --> 1:12:03.799
I used to live here till my...
Till my sister died.

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:05.668
Then I moved to Michael's place.

1:12:08.671 --> 1:12:10.106
What about your parents?

1:12:16.646 --> 1:12:20.182
My mom had a breakdown,
and my dad was killed.

1:12:29.491 --> 1:12:32.895
Jimmy told me about your sister
but not about your parents.

1:12:40.703 --> 1:12:42.605
If it's so painful,
why did you come back?

1:12:45.675 --> 1:12:48.543
Well, it's my home, you know.

1:12:49.111 --> 1:12:50.578
I belong here.

1:12:55.251 --> 1:12:58.120
When my parents died,
I tried to live in their house,

1:12:59.889 --> 1:13:01.057
but I couldn't.

1:13:04.126 --> 1:13:05.962
That's why I came here.

1:13:07.196 --> 1:13:08.698
For a fresh start.

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.101
Go back to school,

1:13:16.872 --> 1:13:18.573
and be close to my brother.

1:13:21.043 --> 1:13:22.510
And take care of him.

1:13:31.887 --> 1:13:33.488
When you found him,

1:13:34.957 --> 1:13:36.524
what did you think?

1:13:48.904 --> 1:13:50.239
I thought...

1:13:54.310 --> 1:13:56.578
I thought, "Fuck, I'm late.

1:14:00.216 --> 1:14:02.084
"I'm too fucking late."

1:16:05.908 --> 1:16:07.209
See you, guys.

1:16:30.833 --> 1:16:32.101
What are you doing here?

1:16:33.936 --> 1:16:35.070
Carlos!

1:16:35.104 --> 1:16:36.972
Michael, what are
you doing here?

1:16:37.006 --> 1:16:38.274
Carlos.

1:16:41.076 --> 1:16:42.411
Carlos.

1:16:43.512 --> 1:16:44.947
No sparring today.

1:16:45.881 --> 1:16:48.884
I brought this guy over here.
Get ready.

1:16:48.918 --> 1:16:51.020
He actually used
to be a real fighter.

1:16:51.053 --> 1:16:54.256
And I want to see him
move around with your kid.

1:16:54.290 --> 1:16:56.258
This ain't the place
for somebody like that.

1:16:56.292 --> 1:16:58.194
Listen to me, Carlos.

1:16:58.227 --> 1:16:59.895
I saw your kid move around
the other day,

1:16:59.929 --> 1:17:01.063
and I thought it
was really impressive.

1:17:01.096 --> 1:17:03.199
Now I want to see him move
around with a real fighter.

1:17:03.232 --> 1:17:04.500
That's why I brought
this guy in here.

1:17:04.533 --> 1:17:06.670
- Michael, stop it.
- Am I talking to you?

1:17:09.071 --> 1:17:10.239
I didn't think so.

1:17:12.007 --> 1:17:13.209
This is my gym.

1:17:13.242 --> 1:17:14.944
I know it's your fucking gym.

1:17:14.977 --> 1:17:16.245
And that's why I brought
a fighter in here

1:17:16.278 --> 1:17:18.047
so he can move around
with your kid.

1:17:19.215 --> 1:17:21.217
Carlos look at me.
Look at me!

1:17:22.551 --> 1:17:26.055
I'm asking you for
a favor here. You understand?

1:17:26.088 --> 1:17:28.290
And I think you want
to fucking give me that favor,

1:17:28.324 --> 1:17:29.858
- do you understand?
- You fuck!

1:17:29.892 --> 1:17:32.061
Carlos, come on!
Stop it! Stop it!

1:17:32.094 --> 1:17:33.128
Stop it!

1:17:33.462 --> 1:17:34.496
Stop it!

1:17:34.530 --> 1:17:36.398
- Hey, Lenny... Lenny.
- Stop it!

1:17:36.432 --> 1:17:38.300
Put the fucking gun down!

1:17:44.406 --> 1:17:45.841
Hey, Carlos...

1:17:48.110 --> 1:17:49.311
I'll see you around.

1:17:51.146 --> 1:17:52.381
And, Ryan...

1:17:54.450 --> 1:17:55.951
I'll see you around, too.

1:18:00.556 --> 1:18:01.957
Peter, you comin'?

1:18:09.098 --> 1:18:10.432
Get out of my gym!

1:18:37.893 --> 1:18:39.028
Hey.

1:18:41.063 --> 1:18:42.097
Uh...

1:18:47.069 --> 1:18:48.103
Look, uh...

1:18:49.305 --> 1:18:51.840
It's not gonna be easy, I know.

1:18:53.309 --> 1:18:55.144
Something bad
happened to your father.

1:19:00.983 --> 1:19:02.051
Don't worry.

1:19:03.919 --> 1:19:05.087
We're family.

1:19:06.322 --> 1:19:07.523
You're gonna move with us.

1:19:08.991 --> 1:19:12.094
With Aunt Theresa,
Cousin Michael...

1:19:16.666 --> 1:19:19.368
Uh...

1:19:20.903 --> 1:19:22.371
You won't be alone anymore.

1:19:24.173 --> 1:19:25.240
I'll look after you.

1:19:28.944 --> 1:19:30.245
You're like my own son now.

1:19:35.050 --> 1:19:38.354
Get your stuff.
I'll wait for you downstairs.

1:20:28.570 --> 1:20:30.139
We do them in the morning.

1:20:34.410 --> 1:20:36.613
See, you know what I wish?
I wish there was a moment

1:20:36.646 --> 1:20:40.983
where what's gonna happen

1:20:41.016 --> 1:20:42.985
is right there with
what already happened.

1:20:43.018 --> 1:20:46.088
So Carlos can see it,
the cause and the effect.

1:20:47.757 --> 1:20:49.057
How do I do that?

1:20:50.993 --> 1:20:53.663
What I really want is

1:20:53.696 --> 1:20:55.698
that we kill him
more than once, but...

1:21:01.069 --> 1:21:03.105
We park a car in front of
his garage door in the morning,

1:21:03.138 --> 1:21:05.407
so when the kid gets out
of the car to open the door,

1:21:05.441 --> 1:21:08.076
then bam, bam, we do him
right there on the sidewalk,

1:21:08.110 --> 1:21:10.312
in front of Carlos.

1:21:10.345 --> 1:21:13.616
You got to make sure that
he sees it before you do him.

1:21:13.650 --> 1:21:16.151
I don't really care who does who.

1:21:16.185 --> 1:21:18.353
But you got to do the kid first.

1:21:18.387 --> 1:21:19.521
So Carlos sees it.

1:21:36.205 --> 1:21:38.106
Are you gonna try
and talk me out of this?

1:21:39.609 --> 1:21:41.443
Hmm?

1:21:41.477 --> 1:21:43.545
No, there's not much more
to talk about, right?

1:21:48.751 --> 1:21:51.053
Hey, you know,
I was just thinking

1:21:51.086 --> 1:21:53.021
maybe it's better
if you do Carlos yourself,

1:21:53.055 --> 1:21:55.123
you know,
just to keep it in the family.
