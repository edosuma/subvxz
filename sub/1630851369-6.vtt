- Just forwarded
your mom's labs.

09:58.641 --> 10:02.166
- Yeah, it's about
what I expected.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.821
- Are you sure you don't want
an attending instead of me?

10:04.865 --> 10:07.345
- This way I can stay
on top of her case.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.174
- Okay, well,
how do you wanna handle this?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.873
- You take the lead.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.963
She's more likely
to listen to you anyway.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.662
- Terri, you definitely have
an infection in your arm

10:19.706 --> 10:21.316
that has spread
to your bloodstream.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.274
We have to treat it like MRSA
until your cultures come back.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.189
- We already knew
it was infected.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.148
- Yes, Mom,
but this particular type

10:27.191 --> 10:30.151
of infection is resistant
to most forms of antibiotics.

10:30.194 --> 10:33.328
- I thought she was my doctor.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.677
- We can still treat it, Terri.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.896
We'd like
to put in a PICC line.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.680
- It's a catheter
we'll leave in your arm.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
- Because if you do have MRSA--

10:39.334 --> 10:41.902
- It's a minimum of six weeks
of intravenous antibiotics.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.165
- Out of the question.
- It's not really optional.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.820
- You can't force me to take
some medicine I don't want.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.691
- We have no intention
of forcing anything.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.172
- But if the infection goes
untreated, then it could spread

10:51.215 --> 10:53.696
to your heart valves
and turn into endocarditis.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.219
Which could kill you.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.308
- Six weeks I have to keep
coming back to the hospital?

10:57.352 --> 10:58.701
No.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.270
- We could also make
arrangements

11:02.313 --> 11:03.967
for a home health nurse
to come to your house.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.666
- Or wherever you're staying.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.972
- She's ashamed of me
because I live in a van.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.757
- Once the infection
is cleared, then we can--

11:10.800 --> 11:13.803
- No, no, I'm not letting you
put some thing in my arm

11:13.847 --> 11:16.284

like a fish whenever you want.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.599

- A week.

11:29.558 --> 11:32.082
- Marielle's been nagging me
to get this looked at,

11:32.126 --> 11:35.564
but sure it's just a cold.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.262
- What kind of cold
makes it hard to breathe?

11:38.306 --> 11:40.482
- It's called a chest cold,
hon.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.527
- COVID PCR test
came back negative.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.486

11:44.529 --> 11:46.357

and chest X-ray.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.750

11:47.794 --> 11:48.751
- We're gonna get to the bottom
of this, Gordon.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.013
You sit tight.

11:50.057 --> 11:53.451
- Don't worry.
I won't let him go anywhere.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.540
- She's a tyrant, doc.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.369
Wouldn't even let me
get a motorcycle.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.894

he still talks about that.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.286

listening to her.

What's going on?

my mom came in earlier.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.702

- Yeah, I did.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.922
- Yeah, I was hoping
that you might talk to her.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.575
She has a MRSA infection,

12:30.619 --> 12:32.360

12:33.709 --> 12:35.450

been this way.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.799
I can't even get her to commit

12:36.843 --> 12:38.714
to taking her
blood pressure medication,

12:38.758 --> 12:42.500

intravenous antibiotics.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.806

She and I kinda speak
a different language.

I could even remember.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.951

13:43.910 --> 13:45.694
She'd mouth off to a boss,
get fired.
