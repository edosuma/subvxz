00:25.926 --> 00:29.096
I'll...

00:29.097 --> 00:30.457
I'll start by saying

00:30.464 --> 00:33.034
that all charges
against Pernell Harris

00:33.035 --> 00:35.735
regarding the murder
of Shane Caldwell

00:35.736 --> 00:37.036
have been dropped.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.237
It has come to light that the...

00:39.240 --> 00:41.378
That the case against Mr. Harris

00:41.379 --> 00:43.535
was predicated
on false evidence.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.279
Our internal investigation
indicates

00:46.280 --> 00:48.220
that this was not a case
of human error

00:48.221 --> 00:49.876
or negligence,

00:49.883 --> 00:53.453
but rather a result
of criminal misconduct

00:53.454 --> 00:55.094
within the police department.

00:57.225 --> 01:02.125
A group of at least four
San Vicente police officers

01:02.130 --> 01:05.998
participated in dozens
of serious crimes.

01:05.999 --> 01:10.999
They were responsible for
the attempt to frame Mr. Harris.

01:11.004 --> 01:14.674
DNA evidence was planted
on Shane Caldwell's body.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.405
We have also confirmed
that threats and intimidation

01:19.413 --> 01:21.814
were used to coerce
the statement

01:21.815 --> 01:23.175
of an alleged eyewitness,

01:23.184 --> 01:25.552
Mr. Michael Alcala.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.688
Though the investigation
is ongoing,

01:28.689 --> 01:31.958
we are confident
that we have identified

01:31.959 --> 01:34.729
the ringleader,
a Sergeant Scott Kessler.

01:34.730 --> 01:39.498
Now, this morning,
an arrest warrant was issued

01:39.500 --> 01:41.170
was issued for Sergeant Kessler.

01:41.171 --> 01:42.599
Scott Kessler! Hands up!

01:42.603 --> 01:44.273
- Back away from the car!
- Let me see your hands!

01:44.274 --> 01:45.572
- Do it! Now!
- Put 'em up!

01:47.308 --> 01:50.477
- The fuck is this?
- I said put your hands up!

01:50.478 --> 01:53.178
- Scott!
- Get in the house, Camila.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.821
Get inside now!

01:58.619 --> 02:00.349
- Gun!
- Drop your weapon!

02:00.354 --> 02:01.694
- No...
- Put it down now!

02:05.726 --> 02:11.496
He resisted and was shot
by police at the scene.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.066
- He did not survive.
- No!

02:14.067 --> 02:17.204
Let me just say the prosecution

02:17.205 --> 02:19.965
and the SFPD are committed
to justice.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.843
My God! No!

02:24.278 --> 02:27.314
As a sworn officer of the court,

02:27.315 --> 02:29.445
I am determined
to ferret out anyone

02:29.450 --> 02:31.450
involved in this corruption.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.786
And to Mr. Harris
and Mrs. Harris,

02:33.787 --> 02:36.787
on behalf of the city
of San Vicente,

02:36.790 --> 02:40.830
I extend our deepest apologies.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.030
We will not be taking
questions at this time.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.904
Ma'am.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.409
- I've been calling.
- I've been busy.

02:53.410 --> 02:55.607
- Does he know?
- About what?

02:55.609 --> 02:56.939
"About what?"
Are you kidding me?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.314
About the tape. Does he know?

02:58.315 --> 03:01.248
- No, sir.
- I want the recording back.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.449
You'll have it.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.415
I knew you'd find
a way to pull it out.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.956
- You always do.
- Thank you, Bobo.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.324
Yeah.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.785
Couldn't have done it
without you.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.265
No comment. No comment.
Thank you.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.527
No comment.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.706
Let's make this look good
for the cameras?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.079
Mr. Harris! This way!

03:37.851 --> 03:39.986
Kessler?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.287
Had to be someone.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.164
What are you doing here?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.465
I wanted to say hi...

05:00.468 --> 05:02.198
and that I'm sorry.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.270
Why are you so hard headed,

05:04.271 --> 05:07.206
I don't have many friends,
Tessie.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.837
You think we're friends?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.882
I want us to be.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.447
I see the "for sale"
sign's gone.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.384
You sold the house already?

05:17.385 --> 05:19.385
No. I'm moving in.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.917
You liked it that much?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.287
It's not that.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.394
I can't sell it.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.395
This house is all I have left.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.996
Why? What happened?

05:29.997 --> 05:33.797
Well, someone else decided
to betray me.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.839
But this someone happened
to be managing all my money.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.667
You should call Judge Harris.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.008
How many times do I have
to tell you no?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.876
I'll figure it out.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.146
He cares about you. Cares about this baby.
He's the father.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.217
Pernell doesn't care about
people. He uses them.

05:49.218 --> 05:53.046
- That is not true.
- Is this really why you came here?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.463
Are you here for him?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.060
- Get out of this house.
- No...

05:58.061 --> 05:59.488
Right now.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.027
It doesn't matter who sent me.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.558
I'm saying things that
you should think about

06:02.563 --> 06:04.200
for yourself and the baby.

06:04.201 --> 06:07.437
Things I've already thought
about a thousand times.

06:07.438 --> 06:10.465
Every version from every angle.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.271
I don't want his money.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.441
I want my baby to be happy.

06:14.442 --> 06:17.610
You want to be my friend, K.D.?

06:17.611 --> 06:19.649
You go and you talk to Pernell

06:19.650 --> 06:22.077
and you convince him
to leave me alone.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.069
- Did you get my message?
- No. I saw you called.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.910
I figured you could tell me
when I got here.

06:44.911 --> 06:47.835
Right. Well, you have a visitor.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.849
What's going on?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.651
You know, I was waiting

06:59.653 --> 07:01.393
in the parking lot
for almost an hour

07:01.394 --> 07:03.818
trying to talk myself
out of this.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.962
You were right
about P.J.'s suicide note.

07:05.963 --> 07:09.159
There's a message. I just
can't figure out what it is.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.772
I mean, maybe he was trying
to tell me who killed him?

07:11.773 --> 07:14.325
No, no, don't. Not here.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.968
Crystal, I saw the...

07:15.969 --> 07:18.869
Jocelyn.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.008
- How've you been?
- Good.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.079
Better.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.376
What can I do for you Nathan?

07:27.380 --> 07:30.020
Well, I just came by
to congratulate you and Pernell.

07:30.021 --> 07:31.517
Thank you.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.019
Good to see you, Jocelyn.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.661
Always a pleasure.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.599
Congratulate you for what?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.882
Let's go! Get it out!

08:02.883 --> 08:05.153
- Right back there.
- Thank you.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.661
- Kessler's dead.
- What?

08:14.662 --> 08:17.229
They blamed him for everything.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.300
Murdered him in front
of his own family.

08:19.301 --> 08:20.729
They will answer for their sins.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.444
Well, you're damn right
they will.

08:22.445 --> 08:26.065
'Cause you and me,
we're the answer.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.013
These are the cops that helped
Toby and Shane kill P.J.

08:29.014 --> 08:31.578
I want everybody
on that video dead.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.909
Except for Chief Clay.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.246
- I said everybody.
- No, you can't.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.248
You have a deal.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.585
Fuck the deal.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.686
Come here.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.087
Kessler's wife is arranging
his funeral.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.989
All my so-called friends
have toasted my freedom.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.226
P.J.'s killers
are walking around free.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.857
If we go after Chief Clay,

08:48.862 --> 08:50.202
he sends that confession out,

08:50.203 --> 08:51.397
you go to jail.

08:51.398 --> 08:55.798
You're right.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.737
Worry about Toby later.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.268
- But these guys.
- Yeah. I'm with you.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.646
We're the answer.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.347
Keith?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.684
What about Tessie?

09:11.685 --> 09:15.085
I talked to her. She's still...

09:15.088 --> 09:17.728
Maybe you should just
leave it alone for a while.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.189
Shit.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.765
No, she'll come around.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.336
She's too smart to think
she can get custody.

09:28.337 --> 09:31.095
Plus her being broke.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.439
She'll come around.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.078
How do you know she's broke?

09:35.079 --> 09:37.335
The guy that manages
her money owed me favor.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.084
Keith, come on.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.015
This isn't 'cause
I wanna hurt Tessie.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.356
This is about the son
that God gave me.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.757
Now, if you can't get
somebody to trust you,

09:52.760 --> 09:54.730
you gotta get 'em to need you.

09:54.731 --> 09:55.898
You understand?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.298
I guess so.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.829
Good.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.244
'Cause we got shit to do.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.510
That motherfucker.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.024
Well, if we know
that Toby killed him,

10:17.025 --> 10:20.047
then why don't we
just turn him in?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.523
Have you two ladies had time
to look at the menu?

10:22.524 --> 10:24.222
We're not eating, Manny.

10:24.224 --> 10:29.195
Could we just get a bottle
of Sequoia Grove Cambium 2007?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.596
Thank you.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.227
Thank you.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.736
Toby knows we know.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.040
But if we expose him,
we put ourselves in danger.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.577
Fuck.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.617
No, it doesn't make this make any
more sense than it did before.

10:48.618 --> 10:50.215
I don't know that
I know any word here

10:50.217 --> 10:51.747
that could mean the word "cop."

10:51.752 --> 10:53.990
What makes you think
there is a message?

10:53.991 --> 10:57.156
Because there's all
these altered memories here.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.857
P.J. makes references
to things in our past,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.189
but every time
I get into a story,

11:00.193 --> 11:03.262
he changes one detail,
like right here.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.164
The Dominican music
coming from our neighbors.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.395
It wasn't Dominican music.
It was Dominican cigar smoke.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.900
And the reason I know that
is 'cause I used to tell him

11:09.903 --> 11:11.841
his room smells like
a "Soprano's" episode.

11:11.842 --> 11:14.639
Is there some memory
where he substitutes

11:14.641 --> 11:16.081
one person for another?

11:16.082 --> 11:18.306
No. No, just little...

11:18.311 --> 11:22.181
What if it's not a person
that he's leading you to?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.092
Holy shit.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.761
"Where I stole back
the first kiss I took.

11:31.762 --> 11:33.959
Where all the
milestones started."

11:33.961 --> 11:35.361
See, that part stood out to me,

11:35.362 --> 11:37.129
because he didn't make
the first move.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.130
I did.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.198
That's what he meant
by "milestones."

11:43.203 --> 11:44.973
Our first kiss was
at the First Mile Rock.

11:44.974 --> 11:47.272
- Where is that?
- In Big Sur.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.276
Mrs. Harris?

11:50.277 --> 11:54.777
Great. Could you
just put that on my tab?

11:54.782 --> 11:55.982
We have to go.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.993
- Thank you.
- Okay.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.190
Keep it down out here!

12:09.496 --> 12:11.396
Fucking delinquents.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.699
Kastelein's done.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.039
They're gonna know
something's wrong

12:50.040 --> 12:51.637
when he doesn't show
up for work tomorrow.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.307
We need to get
Warren before then.

12:53.308 --> 12:56.075
He jogs Guadalupe Park
every morning around dawn.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.736
That's too public, man.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.114
No, not at that time of day...

12:59.115 --> 13:01.612
You just can't shoot this time.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.124
You can take him without a gun?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.525
What's wrong?

13:13.526 --> 13:15.956
Look, Dad. Look.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.313
Judge Harris, we gotta go.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.529
Wow.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.698
Beautiful.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.299
How'd you find this spot?

13:55.302 --> 13:59.005
You don't remember this place?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.966
I've been here?

14:00.974 --> 14:05.284
You, me, P.J.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.981
Shit.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.762
The night he snuck out
for the meteor thing, the...

14:15.763 --> 14:18.455
The Leonid meteor shower.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.227
Every cop in San Vicente
was looking for him.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.797
And they found him right here.

14:22.798 --> 14:25.264
With his telescope,
refusing to go home

14:25.265 --> 14:27.065
until it was all over.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.597
Stubborn as shit.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.636
He loved magic.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.937
As long as it was real.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.484
Pernell?

14:40.813 --> 14:45.384
I think I know where the
encryption key to Bathwater is.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.054
- What?
- I'm going to Big Sur tomorrow to get it

14:48.055 --> 14:50.955
with Jocelyn.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.228
Wanna come?

14:54.727 --> 14:58.327
- I can't.
- Why?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.404
I'm working on something.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.571
What do you mean?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.811
This is what undoes you:

15:12.812 --> 15:15.082
Your lying, the secrecy.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.186
Right.

15:25.558 --> 15:29.628
Remember I told you there were
four cops on that video

15:29.629 --> 15:31.159
where P.J. was...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.470
Well, as of today,
only two of them are alive.

15:37.204 --> 15:41.414
Now, I gotta move fast,
before Toby gets me back.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.684
I know.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.650
I must sound like a monster.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.052
The fuck, maybe I am.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.590
And if I'm happy to hear it?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.367
What does that make me?

16:08.935 --> 16:11.035
Frankenstein's bride?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.461
- What he fuck happened?
- He was ready for me.

18:13.462 --> 18:15.200
What do you mean,
he was ready for you?

18:15.201 --> 18:17.725
He knew I was coming! Fuck!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.165
He shot you?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.266
Yeah. It's through the calf.
No bone.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.698
Shit. Shit!

18:30.810 --> 18:32.380
Anybody here?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.181
My God. K.D., what happened?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.952
- He got shot.
- You have to take him to a hospital.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.789
- He doesn't wanna go.
- It's not up to him.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.817
He knows somebody
who can patch him up.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.422
- We just need someplace to do it.
- It can't be here.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.392
Please. I just need
a little help.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.933
Hand of God's the only
place I can do it.

18:47.934 --> 18:50.527
- He's been shot!
- Fine. We'll take him in.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.200
But not you. You, you get out.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.700
Thank you.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.673
- All right. Here we go.
- Let's go in the kitchen.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.332
Time to find out where
the path has been leading.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.253
Hey, K.D.?

19:47.254 --> 19:50.922
I gotta ask.
What kind of church is this?

19:50.923 --> 19:54.092
You get shot,
and they let you come here?

19:54.093 --> 19:55.903
The kind that doesn't judge.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.255
You almost done?

19:57.264 --> 20:00.432
Easy. Easy.
You'll rip the stitches.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.668
Yeah. Done.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.799
Thank you.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.577
Here.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.854
These will take the edge off.

20:12.855 --> 20:17.145
No, thanks.
I'll just deal with the pain.

20:17.149 --> 20:21.149
Well, your friend already paid
for them, so do what you want.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.963
Shit. You can get 40 a pop
for those on the street.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.731
- Patterson?
- Yeah.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.102
If I want to go somewhere else,

20:37.103 --> 20:39.305
be somebody else,

20:39.306 --> 20:40.636
who would I talk to?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.911
I may know some names.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.345
Who you trying to get away from?

21:00.259 --> 21:03.899
- Doctor says he's fine.
- Thank God.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.335
Seems like you dodged
a bullet of your own.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.036
You're a lucky man.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.205
Not luck, Paul. Providence.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.477
It's God's hand
that delivered me.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.182
You don't believe that.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.785
Let's just say I doubt it.

21:26.786 --> 21:31.116
Two days ago, I was looking
for this witness they have.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.191
Guy was gonna testify against
me. I thought stopping him

21:33.192 --> 21:35.192
was the only thing that
could keep me out of prison.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.734
Yeah. Whatever you did to him,
I don't wanna know.

21:36.735 --> 21:38.099
Well, it didn't come to that.

21:38.100 --> 21:41.097
God sent me visions through P.J.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.940
Took me down a whole other path.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.811
Let me show you something.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.807
Get in.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.382
I want you to see
how this works.

21:54.383 --> 21:55.981
How God is using me.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.898
I got visions of letters
and numbers.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.069
Didn't make sense to me at
first, and then it hit me.

22:16.070 --> 22:17.598
It was a license plate.

22:17.604 --> 22:21.044
Took me to a trailer park
in the middle of nowhere.

22:21.045 --> 22:22.940
It's where I found this.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.886
There's a video on there.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.254
P.J.'s murder.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.815
What?

22:37.824 --> 22:43.294
He didn't commit suicide.
He was killed by cops.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.465
Shane Caldwell
secretly recorded that.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.635
- Dear Lord.
- Do you see now?

22:49.636 --> 22:52.296
That video is what set me free.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.673
And I would never have found it

22:54.674 --> 22:57.242
if God wasn't directing me.

22:57.243 --> 23:00.111
How could this exonerate you?

23:00.112 --> 23:04.916
'Cause one of the cops
on that video is Toby Clay.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.847
He was gonna have to get
the murder charges dropped

23:06.853 --> 23:10.823
or he was burn
right alongside me.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.230
I want you to keep that for me.

23:14.231 --> 23:15.726
No, I'm not getting involved.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.829
You're already involved, Paul.

23:18.831 --> 23:22.468
God involved you
the day you baptized me.

23:22.469 --> 23:26.104
You thought you were using me...

23:26.105 --> 23:28.805
but God was using you...

23:28.808 --> 23:32.078
despite your selfish intentions.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.485
It's true.

23:39.486 --> 23:42.086
I wanted your money.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.318
But I was trying to lead you
to the scripture.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.493
To bring me to him.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.627
It's like Balen.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.129
How he went from a curse
to a blessing.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.131
It's exactly like that.

23:57.537 --> 24:01.167
Anything happens to me, I want you
to share this with the world.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.704
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24:23.705 --> 24:25.126
Thank you.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.335
I'm starving.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.236
Want one? They're fresh?

24:34.340 --> 24:36.040
Fresh from Washington.

24:39.278 --> 24:42.378
That's a lazy fucking scam.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.616
But delicious.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.747
It's weird being here
without P.J.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.135
I think I know where
to look for it.

25:04.136 --> 25:08.906
There is a line here that says,
"red flowers born in the sand."

25:08.908 --> 25:11.208
We were leaving here one night,

25:11.210 --> 25:13.579
and my car got a flat,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.150
and instead of calling AAA,

25:15.151 --> 25:18.647
we decided to camp
under a lifeguard tower.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.421
Then P.J. started
a fire using road flares,

25:21.422 --> 25:23.960
and he said it looked like
roses growing out of the sand.

25:23.961 --> 25:25.786
I think that's where it is.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.599
- Let's go.
- We have to wait till morning.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.495
We can't go there
until the tide is low.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.826
There's a place that rents
cabins not too far from there.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.816
- Thanks.
- Seat taken, Gil?

25:57.456 --> 26:00.086
Get cancer.

26:00.092 --> 26:04.495
I remember
the first case I lost.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.626
It was a golf buddy
of my dad's, right?

26:06.633 --> 26:07.999
Rich fucker.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Never did get the hang
of paying taxes.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.812
I know how this works.
The uprising failed,

26:12.813 --> 26:15.705
so now heads have to be placed

26:15.708 --> 26:17.778
on pikes to deter others.

26:19.846 --> 26:23.376
- Fonseca Porto '08, please.
- Separate checks.

26:23.382 --> 26:27.352
Anyway, I spent...
I spent weeks coaching this guy.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.054
Researching, right?

26:29.055 --> 26:31.855
Prepping as if we were going
before the Supreme Court.

26:31.858 --> 26:35.226
I had this fucking case
in the bag.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.297
Then the night before the trial,

26:37.298 --> 26:39.965
this asshole gets fucking caught

26:39.966 --> 26:42.796
banging a teenager
at the Four Seasons.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.670
His wife finds out.

26:44.671 --> 26:47.911
She blows the whistle on a secret
bank account he's got offshore.

26:47.912 --> 26:51.707
Basically giftwraps
the case for the prosecution.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.945
I'll pack up my office today

26:53.946 --> 26:55.546
if it means
you'll leave me alone.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.877
But despite
all the time I wasted

26:57.884 --> 26:59.694
and the blemish against
my record,

26:59.695 --> 27:02.086
it didn't really matter to me.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.318
- Wanna know why?
- Actually, stay right there.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.793
Try and get one
right in your mouth.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.961
Because in my heart of hearts,

27:09.962 --> 27:12.802
I knew this piece of shit
shouldn't have got off.

27:12.803 --> 27:15.399
See, guys like you and me,

27:15.401 --> 27:16.901
we only care about failure.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.343
We're trying to do
the right thing.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.376
There really are
no hard feelings, Gil.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.077
You were just trying to do
what you thought was right.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.920
And with all the corruption
out there,

27:31.921 --> 27:34.848
we need more people like
you in this fuckin' city.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.770
- You need some help?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

27:46.771 --> 27:48.496
No, please,
let me give you a hand.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.770
And then you can help me by
telling me where the woodpile is.

27:51.771 --> 27:55.409
I've been wandering around
hopelessly for the last 20 minutes.

27:55.410 --> 27:56.775
- Deal.
- All right.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.806
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.578
- Where are we...
- Right there.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.879
- There.
- The one on the left.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.987
So you here for business
or pleasure?

28:06.988 --> 28:09.554
Um, a little bit of a getaway.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.755
- Nice.
- You?

28:12.759 --> 28:15.259
Business disguised as pleasure,

28:15.261 --> 28:18.401
company retreat,
and some team building.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.932
I'm sorry, I hate those things.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.102
It's too touchy-feely for me.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.805
- No offense.
- None taken.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.436
I feel the same way.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.640
I don't care how many
trust circles we have to do.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.849
I do not believe that the
process is more important

28:32.850 --> 28:34.345
than the results or some...

28:34.346 --> 28:35.916
I don't know
what I'm fucking saying...

28:35.917 --> 28:37.215
I know what you mean.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.486
- Here we go.
- And here's your map.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.518
Thank you.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.424
Do you need anything else?

28:46.425 --> 28:47.855
Maybe do you wanna...

28:47.860 --> 28:50.260
Do you wanna have a drink?

28:50.262 --> 28:51.862
Really?

28:51.864 --> 28:55.433
Yeah. Man, what am I, stupid?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.803
No, I...

28:57.804 --> 28:59.337
- Um...
- So...

28:59.338 --> 29:03.574
It's really sweet of you,
but, um...

29:03.575 --> 29:04.905
No thanks.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.211
- You sure?
- Yeah.

29:06.212 --> 29:10.222
All right. I'll see you around.

29:27.166 --> 29:31.666
A little tight.
Have you been guilt eating?

29:31.670 --> 29:33.970
Fuck you, Randy.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.706
What did Perez say?

29:35.707 --> 29:37.007
We back in the rotation?

29:37.009 --> 29:39.849
Full calendar starting
on Monday.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.547
This a good time?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.418
Come on in.

29:48.287 --> 29:52.187
After our conversation,
I thought you should have this.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.760
Toby asked me to hold on
to it just in case.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.861
I didn't look.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.334
Thank you, Gilbert.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.244
You're gonna make a great mayor.

30:22.889 --> 30:26.159
- How you doing, Tim?
- Just fine, Judge. How are you?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.230
There he is.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.934
How does it feel to be free?

30:35.935 --> 30:37.735
Like I'm walking on air.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.565
Still can't believe it.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.012
It's good to see you
and Crystal together.

30:44.013 --> 30:45.240
It's nice. How's she doing?

30:48.780 --> 30:50.720
Still can't believe this either.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.652
Bobo, wait. Just wait.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.888
Hear me out.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.857
I didn't kill him.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.358
But I ordered it done,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.560
instead of watching him go free.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.971
Given the circumstances,
I'm sure you'll understand

31:09.972 --> 31:12.269
if I don't show up
to that little soiree

31:12.271 --> 31:18.276
where you announce you're
running for reelection.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.407
Yeah.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.212
Well...

31:22.214 --> 31:24.752
maybe you should have skipped
my birthday party, too.

31:24.753 --> 31:27.288
Life after Pernell began the
second that recording started.

31:27.289 --> 31:28.986
That's all you have to say?

31:31.157 --> 31:32.617
You here for an apology?

31:34.994 --> 31:37.728
I don't know.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.064
Maybe I am.

31:39.065 --> 31:42.325
Maybe... Maybe there's
a little part of me

31:42.334 --> 31:45.236
that thinks that
if you say I'm sorry,

31:45.237 --> 31:48.977
that we could get
past this maybe.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.411
Okay, I'm sorry.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.746
I'm sorry it came down to this.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.517
And I'm not sorry I did it.

31:57.518 --> 31:59.346
You broke my fucking heart,
Pernell.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.687
I trusted you.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.655
Well, I guess that's it then.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.166
You should have
known better, Bobo.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.565
That sounds like a threat.

32:22.508 --> 32:26.444
You don't ever want
to take sides against me.

32:26.445 --> 32:32.115
Now, either you blend
into the background,

32:32.118 --> 32:34.548
or I'm gonna fucking
destroy you.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.622
"Blend." I like that.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.764
You should take stock
before you start making threats.

32:40.765 --> 32:42.327
Times have changed.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.628
You survived.
That's good for you.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.265
But the ground has shifted.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.196
San Vicente is no longer

32:49.201 --> 32:52.037
a Harris family fiefdom.

32:52.038 --> 32:55.368
I'm being backed by something way more
powerful than money and connections.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.675
Because you're anointed.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.306
Yeah, it must be real hard
for someone like you

33:00.312 --> 33:03.481
to understand...
Taking what you want,

33:03.482 --> 33:05.422
no matter how it fucks things
for everyone else,

33:05.423 --> 33:07.387
especially the ones
you say you love.

33:07.388 --> 33:09.916
In your world, everything and
everyone is here to serve you.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.221
See what I mean?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.392
Come on, you always had
a God complex.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.503
The only difference now is
you're saying it out loud.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.472
You know what I hated most
about this?

33:27.473 --> 33:30.713
When I realized
I lost my best friend.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.378
I wasn't your best friend.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.391
I was your favorite slave.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.297
I gave you a warning.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.018
Shh!

34:15.020 --> 34:18.255
You scream, and I'll kill you.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.757
Shh! Do you understand?

34:22.128 --> 34:23.928
Nod.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.929
- Where is your boyfriend?
- Visiting the sick.

34:26.931 --> 34:30.502
Well, I'm sick.
He's got something I want.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.708
Call him. Now.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.713
Let go, you fuck.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.623
The most dangerous creation
in any society

34:43.623 --> 34:46.784
is the man who has nothing
to lose.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.485
Yes. I like that.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.188
- Kugler.
- Sir.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.590
I'm gonna start
with the Baldwin quote.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.629
- I love it.
- What do you think, Pop?

34:54.630 --> 34:57.195
Re-elect Mayor Boston
or Robert Boston?

34:57.196 --> 35:00.365
Mayor or Robert.

35:00.366 --> 35:04.034
Mayor or Robert.
What do you say, Cam?

35:04.035 --> 35:06.804
I like Robert. You know,
it just sounds dignified to me.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.165
Yeah, let's go with Mayor.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.184
Half the people
in this city don't even know

35:09.185 --> 35:10.605
my first name is Robert.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.039
When are you gonna call Pernell?

35:12.043 --> 35:13.878
I don't know.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.579
- I don't know.
- Look, Pop.

35:15.581 --> 35:19.184
I know you still sour
about the name change.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.045
But Pernell did apologize,
and he owes you now.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.621
Just saying.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.191
I got the Brooks machine
working for me now.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.462
I don't need Pernell.

35:29.928 --> 35:33.498
I could never be a preacher.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.267
I get stage fright.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.668
Like crippling.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.838
When I was a kid, it was so bad,

35:41.840 --> 35:47.077
I had to use a puppet to do
oral presentations in class.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.908
His name was Lucky.

35:48.914 --> 35:52.384
When I pulled his strings,
I felt no fear.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.792
In here, preacher boy.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.495
What the fuck
are you doing here?

36:06.498 --> 36:08.998
I'm the one
who brought you here.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.270
I realized the only way
Detective Warren would know

36:12.271 --> 36:15.506
we were coming for him
is if he bugged my car.

36:15.507 --> 36:20.044
So I just dropped
a few breadcrumbs.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.745
And here you are.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.547
Here we are...

36:24.550 --> 36:26.284
wasting each other's time.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.355
Speak for yourself.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.758
Come here! Come on!

36:33.759 --> 36:36.794
Shit!
What the hell are you doing?

36:36.795 --> 36:41.265
I turn up in they're morgue,
and you go down, you dumb shit!

36:51.142 --> 36:54.745
Relax, Toby.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.746
You think I'm gonna
let you die like this?

37:02.554 --> 37:05.956
You're gut shot and...

37:05.957 --> 37:07.857
since I'm kind of new at this...

37:11.062 --> 37:14.102
How long do we have before
I gotta call an ambulance?

37:14.103 --> 37:17.599
You're fucking crazy.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.335
That's what they say.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.569
- Call now.
- Hang on.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.343
I'm gonna have to ask you
some questions first.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.313
Is that what this is about?
Fuck you!

37:28.314 --> 37:30.424
Are you gonna answer
the questions or not?

37:33.218 --> 37:34.518
Okay, hurry up.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.860
Why'd you kill my son?

37:39.658 --> 37:41.326
It was Anne Wu and Kelly.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.027
They said he had to go.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.558
You never had to do anything
in your fucking life.

37:45.564 --> 37:49.374
Now, the longer you lie to me, the longer
it's gonna take for me to make that call.

37:49.375 --> 37:50.768
Okay, okay!

37:54.005 --> 37:55.465
We knew he was a risk.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.714
He knew the cops
were part of it.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.346
Please. Please call.

38:02.348 --> 38:04.778
Did my daughter-in-law
say please

38:04.783 --> 38:06.853
while you were having her raped?

38:06.854 --> 38:08.792
That was Anne's call, not mine.

38:08.793 --> 38:11.187
I told her it was too messy.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.729
But you just couldn't say no.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.134
In for a penny,
in for a pound, you know?

38:18.135 --> 38:22.429
For Christ sake, call 9-1-1.

38:22.434 --> 38:24.134
Hang on, hang on.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.265
Ray Kelly, where is he?

38:26.271 --> 38:28.406
I don't fucking know.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.607
I swear I don't fucking know!

38:30.609 --> 38:31.909
I'm bleeding out here.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.645
Make the call, God damn it.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.376
Make the fucking call.

38:38.183 --> 38:42.086
You're not gonna need
an ambulance, Toby.

38:42.087 --> 38:45.487
I did what you told me to do.
I got the case dropped.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.928
I answered your fucking
questions.

38:46.929 --> 38:49.955
Yeah, but everybody on
that video's gotta pay.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.162
If I die, you're fucked.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.732
That tape goes out.

38:54.733 --> 38:58.503
You know that.
I'm not fucking bluffing.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.444
I'll take my chances.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.455
How can you not see
the real danger?

40:23.822 --> 40:27.091
Jesus. You scared
the shit out of me.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.092
Sorry.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.859
The encryption key.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.802
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

40:34.803 --> 40:37.400
And I found myself
by the lifeguard tower.

40:37.402 --> 40:39.537
And the tide hadn't receded yet,

40:39.538 --> 40:42.138
so I waited in there,
and there it was.

40:42.140 --> 40:47.150
It was in a cigar box
sealed with candle wax.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.821
Let me get dressed.
We'll go home.

40:56.888 --> 41:02.728
I'm... I'm not going back
to San Vicente, Crystal.

41:04.596 --> 41:09.196
I don't know if I did this for you
or for P.J., but it wasn't for me.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.036
I don't want it.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.211
You take it.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.546
- Okay.
- Jocelyn.

41:25.250 --> 41:29.887
If you ever need anything,
Pernell and I...

41:29.888 --> 41:31.088
I won't.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.458
Buy thank you.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.229
Wait.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.569
Thank you for loving my son.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.182
I'll take 40 on...

43:04.883 --> 43:08.452
I'm really proud of you.

43:08.453 --> 43:10.655
What do you want?

43:10.656 --> 43:14.324
The Bathwater encryption key.

43:14.325 --> 43:15.855
You found it, didn't you?

43:25.436 --> 43:26.966
Here.

43:35.681 --> 43:37.181
All right. All right, all right.

43:37.182 --> 43:40.052
I know. I know.
It's difficult. It's tough.

43:40.053 --> 43:42.221
It's tough.
I considered killing you quick,

43:42.222 --> 43:44.120
so you could die
thinking you'd won.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.256
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

43:46.257 --> 43:47.327
Fuck you.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.769
Who's paying you?
I could pay you more.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.538
Denial, anger, now...

44:01.539 --> 44:03.874
bargaining.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.875
Too bad we don't have time
for acceptance.

44:22.961 --> 44:25.831
- Mrs. Harris!
- I'm here!

44:37.743 --> 44:39.844
Are you okay?

44:39.845 --> 44:42.345
Stay there till I say.

45:03.468 --> 45:04.768
Fucker!

45:15.781 --> 45:16.881
Fuck.

45:18.183 --> 45:21.993
Yeah, I guess
that's all we got then!

46:09.167 --> 46:12.267
No!

46:12.270 --> 46:16.240
No! No, Mrs. Harris.
Mrs. Harris!

46:18.576 --> 46:20.244
Stop.

46:20.245 --> 46:21.245
Stop him.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.615
Hey, beautiful.

46:58.616 --> 47:00.586
Should you be up?

47:02.653 --> 47:04.889
It's gone. It's...

47:04.890 --> 47:06.390
I... I had it.

47:06.391 --> 47:07.491
Shh.

47:09.627 --> 47:11.957
The only thing that matters
is that you are here.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.530
Don't. Don't do that.

47:13.531 --> 47:16.031
Don't give me that...

47:16.034 --> 47:18.304
Hallmark sympathy bullshit.

47:25.110 --> 47:27.050
You found me again.

47:28.146 --> 47:30.016
It keeps happening.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.250
How?

47:41.592 --> 47:42.992
Truth?

47:44.495 --> 47:46.255
You gonna say God?

47:49.935 --> 47:51.995
Then no.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.575
That's a lot of chocolate.

47:58.576 --> 48:01.045
Nathan sent those.

48:01.046 --> 48:03.506
When it comes to employees
who've been stabbed,

48:03.514 --> 48:05.554
he doesn't skimp.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.345
Hey.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.849
I'm sorry I made you
come all this way.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.819
Did you talk to him?

48:42.820 --> 48:44.989
No. He didn't send me.

48:44.990 --> 48:46.990
Then why am I here, Keith?

48:49.494 --> 48:51.104
Here.

48:52.797 --> 48:54.797
There's a phone number in there.

48:54.799 --> 48:59.499
You follow those instructions,
you can disappear.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.010
Start brand new.

49:33.138 --> 49:35.468
Judge Harris. Welcome, welcome.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.041
Hello, Nathan.

49:40.045 --> 49:42.575
Have a seat. Please.

49:57.062 --> 50:00.430
So tell me.
How's our girl doing?

50:00.431 --> 50:03.100
Well, she won't be wearing
a bikini anytime soon,

50:03.101 --> 50:06.070
but you know Crystal.

50:06.071 --> 50:07.371
Nothing can keep her down.

50:07.372 --> 50:10.607
Still, what a relief.

50:10.608 --> 50:13.238
You must feel like
God's favorite nephew.

50:13.244 --> 50:17.614
Jealous?

50:17.615 --> 50:21.845
Yeah, it's nice to have Him
part of the family.

50:21.852 --> 50:25.059
- Amen.
- Hey, I wanted to thank you for that...

50:25.060 --> 50:26.716
That gift you gave my wife.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.058
Please.

50:28.059 --> 50:29.759
Women and chocolate?

50:29.760 --> 50:31.760
Chimpanzee would have done
the same thing.

50:31.762 --> 50:35.401
No, seriously, you helped me understand
the kind of man you really are.

50:35.402 --> 50:37.069
Well, before you canonize me,

50:37.070 --> 50:40.204
be aware that I want Crystal
back on the job by yesterday.

50:40.205 --> 50:42.005
I'm... I'm not talking
about the kindness of it.

50:42.006 --> 50:43.366
I'm talking about the logo.

50:44.842 --> 50:48.478
What's it called? Hexagram?

50:48.479 --> 50:51.014
- Hexagon.
- I'm curious.

50:51.015 --> 50:52.915
What inspired you
to go with that shape?

50:52.917 --> 50:54.287
Bees.

50:55.653 --> 50:59.163
Each cell in a honeycomb
is a perfect hexagon.

51:01.326 --> 51:05.595
'Cause you know what I see?

51:05.596 --> 51:10.366
I see three six-sided figures.
Six, six, six.

51:12.203 --> 51:14.571
What you should see is
our desire

51:14.572 --> 51:16.842
to be an efficient community
working as one

51:16.843 --> 51:18.481
for a fruitful result.

51:19.977 --> 51:21.907
Like a beehive.

51:21.912 --> 51:26.015
I know who you are, Lucifer.

51:26.016 --> 51:27.384
Excuse me?

51:27.385 --> 51:30.754
I am calling you by your name...

51:30.755 --> 51:31.915
Lucifer.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.191
I know who you are,

51:34.192 --> 51:35.762
and I know what you've done.

51:35.763 --> 51:40.060
You came to my city
in the guise of an innovator,

51:40.064 --> 51:43.400
bringing light,
the path to the future.

51:43.401 --> 51:46.035
But you're a venomous snake.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.166
You despise the truth.

51:48.173 --> 51:49.906
My.

51:49.907 --> 51:52.207
I mean, this is something.

51:54.512 --> 51:57.722
I mean, I've heard the stories
about how crazy you are,

51:57.723 --> 52:01.045
but actually seeing it?

52:01.051 --> 52:03.651
Seeing it firsthand?

52:03.654 --> 52:07.191
I mean, it's truly astonishing.

52:07.192 --> 52:08.792
So...

52:11.896 --> 52:15.196
I'm gonna give you back

52:15.200 --> 52:18.700
that fancy tear catcher
you gave me,

52:18.703 --> 52:21.273
'cause you're gonna need it
more than me.

52:21.274 --> 52:22.872
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

52:22.873 --> 52:24.343
Because you're responsible

52:24.344 --> 52:26.912
for the knife wounds
in my wife's chest.

52:26.913 --> 52:28.711
Because you are the architect

52:28.713 --> 52:30.883
behind the rape
of my daughter-in-law.

52:36.454 --> 52:39.823
And because you are the man
behind the murder of my son.

52:39.824 --> 52:44.561
Am I that much of a threat to your
hold on San Vicente, Pernell?

52:44.562 --> 52:48.532
I mean,
that you have manufactured

52:48.533 --> 52:50.843
this ridiculous
Da Vinci Code conspiracy?

52:50.844 --> 52:54.465
Just to make me
the root of all evil?

53:08.319 --> 53:10.589
You took your best shot.

53:13.624 --> 53:15.534
Now I'm gonna take mine.

54:29.834 --> 54:32.344
How you doing?

55:09.206 --> 55:10.876
No.

55:18.449 --> 55:19.619
No. Raymond.

55:25.289 --> 55:26.789
Raymond.

55:28.793 --> 55:30.403
It's empty.

55:38.002 --> 55:41.137
Hi. Anything
I can help you with?

55:41.138 --> 55:43.838
Yeah. Um, do you sell cigars?

55:43.841 --> 55:45.675
No. No, I'm sorry.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.646
Um, we have some
cigarette lighters.

55:47.647 --> 55:50.475
There's a very, very nice
sterling silver one in there.

55:50.481 --> 55:53.681
No, um, for some reason,

55:53.684 --> 55:55.894
I thought that you would have
Dominican cigars.

56:04.562 --> 56:06.432
You his wife?

56:07.305 --> 56:13.810
