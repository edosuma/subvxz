NARRATOR: Four weeks ago,
an invisible dome crashed down

00:05.005 --> 00:06.290
on Chesterâ€™s Mill,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.372
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.423
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.470 --> 00:14.052
forcing each of us
to confront our own personal demons.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.841
Rage,

00:17.142 --> 00:18.643
grief,

00:19.645 --> 00:21.601
- fear.
- My God.

00:23.273 --> 00:27.482
Now, in order to survive, we must
battle our most dangerous adversary,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.064
the enemy within.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.607
You saved me

00:31.823 --> 00:34.656
- from becoming one of them.
- I knew the real you was still in there.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.574
CHRISTINE:
The dome's surface is calcifying.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.573
Unless I can bring it down
with Joe's help--

00:38.747 --> 00:41.159
l have to stay and build this device.
It's the only way out.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.240
CHRISTINE:
Everything has a cycle,

00:43.460 --> 00:46.076
- and mine is coming to an end.
- Who the hell are you?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.877
- Hektor Martin.
- He runs Aktaion.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.797
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
this dome never comes down.

[SILENCED GUNSHOT]

01:07.776 --> 01:09.937
No one saw us, right?

01:10.153 --> 01:11.814
I don't think so.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.948
Easy.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.951
What were you thinking,
sneaking off like that?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.703
You're not my dad.
I can do what I want.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.329
Oh, sass? Now we get sass?

01:27.546 --> 01:31.209
Look, your actions affect all of us.
You could've led those freaks here to us.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.132
But she didn't, okay?
She saved my life, so take it easy.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.131
- We've got bigger problems anyway.
- Oh, you mean Barbie?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.963
Did his little side piece
lure him back to alien town?

01:40.183 --> 01:43.050
No, but their baby is gonna be here
sooner than we thought.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.433
Norrie and I just saw her.
She looks almost full-term.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.937
And I'm pretty sure 12 girls just died
to make it the shortest pregnancy.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.149
Well, then we gotta kill her.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.861
Put her down
before that thing comes out.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.693
Why is that your solution
to everything, killing the problem?

02:01.913 --> 02:06.623
- I'm sure you like stepping on spiders.
- Ifthe spider has a queen baby inside

02:06.835 --> 02:09.247
that's gonna wipe out
the entire human race,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.670
that kind of spider?
Yeah, I think I'd kill it.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.874
This cure of yours,
you really think it'll work?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.668
You said you didn't need it.
You said love was the answer.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.387
And now I'm admitting
that might not be enough.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.679
Glad to hear it.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.595
Dr. Bloom has already synthesized
a base formula.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.224
All we need now is a specimen
of Christine Price's DNA.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.476
You'll need a test subject to try it on,
right?

02:30.859 --> 02:31.974
I can be your lab monkey.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.692
Well, that's very generous of you,

02:34.905 --> 02:38.147
but it's necessary to have a subject
in whom the infection is full-blown.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.652
NORRIE:
I have a question.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.200
Joe, he's working on this thing
to bring the dome down.

02:42.412 --> 02:46.872
What if he finishes it
before you can get this cure to work?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.706
What if they get out?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.955
Well, then we have a bunch
of creepy crawlies

02:51.171 --> 02:54.880
that can have babies in three days
going forth and prospering.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.332
That's not gonna happen.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.839
I told you I'd get Christine Price's DNA.
I'll get it.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.093
Christine was at the barn with Eva.
Better to go there than Town Hall.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.424
- I'll go with you.
- Jim.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.431

HEKTOR: It's our last chance.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.359
All right, nice and easy.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.072
- Lay down, rest.
- Ah. Heh.

- For what?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.586
How is Joe's work progressing?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.919
He was initially resistant,
but he's come around.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.801
We moved him to a larger room
and he's made a few breakthroughs.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.474
But he's still in the planning stage.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.260
We're running out of time.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.563
The dome is dying.
If we don't get out before it does...

04:34.775 --> 04:35.855
I can make him work faster.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.227
No.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.444
No violence. He's too valuable.

- Have you seen Junior?
- I haven't.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.282
But anything you need,
I can take care of.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.576
Joe will need our last remaining
amethyst to continue his work.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.657
I'll find a way
to get it up to him safely.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.661
You've come a long way, Sam.

She's resting. Comfortably.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.595
Good.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.056
The baby should be here
within the day.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.561
I'd like to go after what's left
of the Resistance.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.949
No need.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.242
Our primary concerns right now
are here, under this roof.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.072
The birth of the new queen
and the building of the device.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.122
They still pose a threat.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.955
Are you worried about your daughter,
Barbie?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.581
No.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.372
Only the Kinship.

05:43.218 --> 05:47.882
Inside Eva is the queen who'll lead
our Kinship out of the dome.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.009
Nothing is more important than that.

05:52.143 --> 05:56.603
Your priority is to be by Eva's side
until that baby is born.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.856
I understand.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.648
There's aliens
outside the dome now too.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.106
Not aliens plural
like the James Cameron sequel.

like the Ridley Scott original.

She thinks he's dead, but he's not.

in Zenith.

- We should tell her.
- Wait, wait, wait.

it could mess her up, and Hektor, |--

The original plan
was to have the amethyst

11:19.971 --> 11:21.882
conduct the tones into the egg,

which would act as a key,
signaling the dome to unlock.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.149
- I just told you I was tired.
- No.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.072
I mean about the girls in the barn.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.117
And the sacrifice that they made.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.987
They did their duty.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.745
Just like I'm doing mine
being a vessel for the new queen.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.508
You remember how badly you wanted
to have a baby?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.468
How affected you were

12:44.681 --> 12:47.093
when you found out
you weren't pregnant?

12:50.603 --> 12:51.763
I remember.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.894
But that Eva's gone.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.481
Doesn't matter what I want.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.528
All that matters is what's best
for the group.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.451
This isn't our child.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.528
This child belongs to the Kinship.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.459
JULIA:
This was Patrick four days ago?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.665
HUNTER:
According to the time stamp, yeah.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.796
So he's lying.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.845
[DOOR OPENS]

13:25.471 --> 13:27.928
- It's ready to go.
- You are not using this.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.594
- What's going on?
- I was about to ask the same thing.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.176
What aren't you telling us
about Patrick Walters?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.140
About my father?

13:38.735 --> 13:39.941
He's still alive.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.322
No. That's not possible.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.699
He's dead.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.947
You told me he's dead.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.448
He's not dead, sweetheart,
but he is gone.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.703
What does that even mean?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.502
I think you should have Hunter
show you the video.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.132
I'd like to know
what video you're referring to.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.677
I'm sure you would,
but I'm asking the questions now.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.971
So before you stick this in Junior,

14:10.183 --> 14:12.890
why don't you tell us what happened
to your good friend Patrick?

14:13.102 --> 14:16.094
The only reason I kept Patrick's
condition a secret was for Lily's sake.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.680
- I didn't wanna hurt her.
- Condition?

14:20.860 --> 14:24.068
He turned into something else,
something other.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.110
A kind of energy infused
with a consciousness,

14:28.326 --> 14:29.816
but it wasn't his.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.572
It was their consciousness.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.824
JIM:
So your main man Marston,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.531
he was working on a cure
to save your friend.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.786
But it didn't work?

14:41.672 --> 14:45.585
Well, so who's to say this stuff
won't do the same thing to my son?

14:47.011 --> 14:50.048
HEKTOR:
I'll be honest, Jim. It could.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.463
But I believe it will work.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.969
The advances we've made
since Patrick was lost,

14:55.186 --> 14:58.428
the opportunities we had to derive
a pure strain from Christine,

14:58.648 --> 15:01.230
this is the best shot at treatment
that we've ever had.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.104
We have the briefest of windows
to save this town.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.812
Like you said, Julia, to get the infection
out of Hunter, Norrie, Barbie,

15:08.533 --> 15:11.070
if the cure succeeds,
out of my friend as well.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.992
It's up to you, Jim.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.824
He's your son, not mine.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.963
- It could kill him.
- There's a risk, of course,

15:25.174 --> 15:27.335
but if we don't try?

15:27.552 --> 15:30.168
There certainly won't be a reward.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.386
Do it.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.359
JOE:
Where are we going?

15:51.826 --> 15:55.944
Look, if this is about the dome
calcifying, I already know.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.029
I need your cooperation.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.455
Cooperation?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.909
Seems to me you've only asked
for my submission.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.294
Oh, I see.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.964
You still think we wanna be here.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.384
That we wanted to travel
hundreds of thousands

16:11.596 --> 16:13.837
of light-years
through a cold, harsh vacuum,

16:14.056 --> 16:18.971
that we wanted to leave our home,
our history, behind.

16:20.521 --> 16:24.560
Earth is a wonderful place,
but it's not that great.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.399
Why are you here?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.353
Because we had no choice.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.029
And now neither do you.

16:32.492 --> 16:37.532
Right now, somewhere up in the sky,
they're coming.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.700
Who?

16:47.924 --> 16:50.506
CHRISTINE: Listen to me, Joe.
Listen very carefully.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.711
They destroyed our world,
and they'll destroy yours.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.677
This isn't just about the survival
of the Kinship.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.471
It's about humanity's survival too.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.182
Whether you want to recognize it
or not,

17:04.649 --> 17:07.516
our fates are tied together.

17:08.486 --> 17:12.104
And the only way we stand a chance

17:12.323 --> 17:14.154
is for us to get out of this dome.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.737
That rests entirely in your hands.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.330
LILY:
My poor father.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.424
I failed him.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.175
I never should have given up.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.506
No, Lily, this is not your fault.

17:39.934 --> 17:44.348
- Okay? This one's on Hektor.
- He's been like a second father to me.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.055
How am I supposed
to trust him now?

17:47.358 --> 17:49.189
Look, I don't know him,

17:49.402 --> 17:51.939
and I'm not usually the type
to make excuses

17:52.154 --> 17:56.363
for corporate billionaire overlords,
but maybe he had good intentions.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.031
I'm just saying Hektor
can't be all bad.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.987
He came in here to help us, right?

18:03.207 --> 18:05.789
Get us secure
and get this dome down.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.500
Right, Lily?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.503
Of course.
Of course that's what he's doing.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.126
I'm sorry.
I just need time to process all this.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.422
[GRUNTING]

18:21.601 --> 18:22.886
Come on, kiddo.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.467
You gotta fight through this.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.518
- This cure of yours is burning him up.
- Be patient, Jim. It's a good sign.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.857
JIM: A hundred-and-six-degree
fever's good?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.690
You think brain damage is
a good thing too?

18:34.864 --> 18:38.106
The fact that he's running a fever means
that his body's responding to the virus.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.032
Just give it time, okay?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.577
- Excuse me.
- I don't know what to do.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.787
[SIGHS]

18:49.003 --> 18:50.334
HEKTOR:
Lily.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.164
- I was just trying to protect you.
- From my father?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.715
Not from him,
from what he became.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.669
I didn't want your memory of Patrick
to be corrupted.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.171
That wasn't your decision to make.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.847
I know it wasn't.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.641
And I'm sorry.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.557
Ijust thought if I could find a cure,

19:08.773 --> 19:11.059
I could return him whole to you,
the man you knew.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.984
Everything that I've done since
it happened has been toward that end.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.402
I didn't tell you he was alive,

19:16.572 --> 19:18.984
because I didn't wanna give you
false hope.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.903
I've gotta ask.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.454
How did they get the video?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.705
- I sent the files through.
- Oh...

19:31.921 --> 19:34.207
- I told you to destroy them.
- I know.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.914
The reason why the government
wants us dead is in those files.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.754
If the truth got out
about what's under this dome,

19:40.096 --> 19:41.927
there'd be a situation
that it couldn't control.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.471
Easier to bury the evidence
and hide the bodies.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.800
- That's why we can't ever leave, Lily.
- No.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.977
This information about my father,
it changes everything.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.474
Especially if the cure works.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.023
- No, Lily--
- No, shut up and listen to me.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.568
Say it works
and you save all these people.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.396
And say what Jim told you is true,

20:00.616 --> 20:03.028
that there is a way out of the dome.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.991
You could walk out of here a hero.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.283
The government couldn't touch you.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.539
And those files?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.038
Just an insurance policy.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.629
I need to see my father again.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.045
You owe that to me.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.219
All right, Lily.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.849
If the cure works, I'll get us out.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.147
Eva?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.237
- What's wrong, you in pain?
- No, no pain at all.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.193
Good. Here you go.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.539
- What?
- Nothing.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.250
Eva, what is it?

21:00.468 --> 21:01.799
Talk to me.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.759
It's just all of this is happening
so fast.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.431
I'm not sure I'm ready.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.181
I mean, what ifl let the Kinship
or you down?

21:13.397 --> 21:14.807
Well, why would you think that?

21:16.484 --> 21:19.521
Hey, there is nothing
you can't tell me.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.911
My earliest memory--

21:29.789 --> 21:32.371
I couldn't have been more than 4.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.202
--is of blood.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.707
A drop of blood on a shattered piece
of my mother's family china.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.414
She'd thrown it at my dad.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.543
I don't even know
what they were arguing about.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.505
But I'll never forget
that drop of blood.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.643
Broken piece of him
on a broken piece of her.

21:59.193 --> 22:03.061
Not long after that, my parents and I,
we spent a summer

22:03.280 --> 22:06.943
in a mountain cabin
outside of Salt Lake City.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.905
And it was just the three of us

22:11.413 --> 22:14.450
and the woods and the birds.

22:21.507 --> 22:25.091
And it was the happiest time
of my life.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.753
And then we came back
to the real world.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.214
My parents were divorced
within a year.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.352
I don't want that for our baby.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.310
I want the cabin,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.934
and I want the three of us
to be together forever.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.814
You can have that, Eva.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.648
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about getting out of here,

22:48.868 --> 22:50.950
about running away.
I don't know how.

22:51.161 --> 22:55.825
We'll figure that out,
butjust you and me, our baby.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.869
I knew it.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.912
I knew you weren't one of us.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.457
Julia's still alive, isn't she?

23:08.262 --> 23:09.923
I bet she's...

23:17.646 --> 23:19.102
What did you put in the tea?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.896
I had to, Eva.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.671
Have you made up your mind?

23:53.891 --> 23:55.927
Are you going to help us
take down the dome?

23:56.143 --> 23:58.725
I don't really have a choice, do I?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.269
Neither of us do.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.437
The trick will be doing
the calculations necessary

24:02.650 --> 24:04.686
to split the amethyst
into seven pieces.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.523
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?

24:08.697 --> 24:12.281
In truth, I'm dying.

24:13.661 --> 24:18.451
My cycle's coming to an end,
just as it must.

24:19.541 --> 24:23.284
My work's almost done,
as soon as the dome comes down.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.540
Well, I'll work as fast as I can.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.586
JIM: How's it looking?
BLOOM: Promising.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.512
Very promising.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.476
Dad?

24:45.693 --> 24:48.605
- Where are we?
- You're in a safe place.

24:49.863 --> 24:54.232
- How you feel?
- Like I'm on fire, but I'm awake.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.407
What do you remember?

24:57.705 --> 24:59.036
All of it.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.615
Thanks for not giving up on me.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.077
JIM:
You went through the wringer, kid.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.082
A lot tougher
than I gave you credit for.

25:13.012 --> 25:17.005
Hey, I'm gonna promise you something
right now.

25:17.224 --> 25:21.638
When this dome comes down,
and it will come down,

25:23.564 --> 25:25.725
everything's gonna be different.

25:27.943 --> 25:32.733
You and me, we're gonna start over,
just the two of us.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.028
Maybe we can work together
at the lot.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.364
Rennie and Son.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.696
How's that sound?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.911
Sounds good.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.167
Except for the used-cars part.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.711
Will it have to be used cars?

25:49.923 --> 25:52.790
No, it can be whatever you like.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.877
Important thing

25:57.097 --> 25:58.758
is that it's you and me.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.180
- These restraints too tight?
- No, it's okay.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.850
I get why they're there.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.690
All right.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.190
See if I can wrangle up some pop.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.037
Wanted to give this back.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.252
Was wondering where that went.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.332
No, keep it. I got plenty.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.294
There something else?

26:41.350 --> 26:45.343
What did it feel like
when you first killed somebody?

26:49.817 --> 26:52.058
It gets easier the more you do it.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.735
As far as I recall,
I never bagged anyone

26:54.947 --> 26:57.359
who didn't bear responsibility
for the getting-killed part.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.614
Why? You feeling guilty?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.735
