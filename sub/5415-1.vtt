15:15.214 --> 15:17.149
Hey, silverbird,
I'm talkin' to you.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.284
Huh?

15:18.284 --> 15:21.094
Listen, you wanna be president
of the Texaco Oil?

15:21.687 --> 15:22.922
Sure.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.026
Then clean up the sink
in there.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.897
Then I'll be
president of Texaco Oil?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.897
Whatever happened
to workin' your way up?

15:31.897 --> 15:33.799
He starts workin' for me
10 minutes

15:33.799 --> 15:35.869
and already
he wants to be president.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.170
Get to work in there.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.411
But, sir, I don't work here.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.877
Not even for $1. 10 an hour?

16:08.667 --> 16:11.971
(Navin)
"Dear Folks, I got this
great job in a gas station.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.239
"I don't wanna say
how much I'm getting,

16:14.239 --> 16:16.575
but let's just say
it's a lot."

16:16.575 --> 16:18.844
"I'm enclosing $2."

16:18.844 --> 16:20.948
That's a good boy.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.984
"It's a lot of fun working and
Mr. Hartounian is really nice.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.419
He's teaching me
how to be impatient."

16:27.419 --> 16:28.687
Navin!

16:28.687 --> 16:30.389
"Well, I gotta go now.

16:30.389 --> 16:33.233
What do you think I do,
write letters all day?"

16:35.661 --> 16:37.096
You actually
sleep here?

16:37.096 --> 16:38.506
Yes, is that okay?

16:39.698 --> 16:40.833
Come with me.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.335
I got a beautiful little place
for you to stay.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.247
Put the light on.
You're gonna like it here.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.008
Like it?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.478
I love it!
This is fabulous!

16:52.478 --> 16:55.288
I mean,
you got the toilet here.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.923
This must be
the kitchen. No.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.253
You know, what I could do

17:01.253 --> 17:04.189
is take this wall
and just turn it this way

17:04.189 --> 17:06.191
so I've got
a much larger living space,

17:06.191 --> 17:08.827
plus it'll create a flow
into the main living area.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.295
It'll be incredible.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.798
No, no, I'll just
elevate this about 6 inches.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.500
Create the illusion
of two rooms

17:14.500 --> 17:16.702
and yet still have that flow.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.605
Then I can take bookshelves
and put them here.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.107
No, I'll put the books
right over here.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.942
That way
I can be relaxed over here.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.011
The customers come in
and use the urinal.
Navin.

17:26.011 --> 17:28.079
I won't disturb them,
they won't disturb me.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.783
Take it easy, it's not here.
It's in here.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.784
Oh!

17:33.352 --> 17:35.422
I couldn't afford this,
anyway.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.459
Well, this is it.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.459
It's perfect.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.594
I won't have to
change this at all.

17:42.594 --> 17:43.970
Take a look.

17:44.129 --> 17:47.299
No kitchen, no windows,
no chairs, no tables.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.234
It's a masterpiece
of understatement.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.237
I'll put a bed down here,
get a bigger bulb.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.373
I'll bring some sheets
from the house.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.108
You'll be set for life.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.643
Gosh!

17:58.110 --> 18:00.089
How much is this
gonna cost me?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.880
Nothin'.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.690
When you're rich and famous,
you'll send me a postcard.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.089
A postcard, huh?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.462
Okay. It's a deal.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.139
It's a deal.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.468

Step outside
for a second, darlin'.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.605
Navin,
this is my wife, Lenore.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.240
Lenore, this is Navin.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.575
Pleased to meet you.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.677
Navin, do you know why
a woman of such pulchritude

18:31.677 --> 18:33.312
is married to a man
like me?

18:33.312 --> 18:35.347
'Cause I make
a very comfortable living.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.150
And this is the first time
I'm leaving you alone
on a Sunday.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.052
If anything should happen
to this station,

18:40.052 --> 18:42.293
this woman would leave me
like a...

18:44.089 --> 18:46.758
In other words,
there would be no more, uh...

18:46.758 --> 18:48.494
Do you know what
I'm talkin' about?

18:48.494 --> 18:50.098
Yes, sir. No more...

18:52.397 --> 18:55.467
So remember, guard
this station with your life.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.803
Because my sex life
is in your hands.

muchacho.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.923

We got to have a credit card.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.197
[Exclaiming]

19:19.358 --> 19:21.226
Then all the cash
is locked up?

19:21.226 --> 19:22.828
Oh, no, not locked up.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.196
We got a lot of cash.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.797
It's just that
the banks are closed,

19:25.797 --> 19:28.500
and I'm not allowed to have
cash coming in or going out

19:28.500 --> 19:30.335
'cause I'm here alone
for the first time.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.070
I don't want
anything to happen.

And you know,
you flash this kind of wad
in front of some people,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.275
they'll kill you for it.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.910
So we got to
have a credit card.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.946
Hey, Trin, have you got
a credit card in there?

I don't smoke.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.625

is that?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.693
A joint.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.880

I fixed them.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.438

27:20.438 --> 27:23.375
"What causes glasses
to slip on and off?"

27:23.375 --> 27:26.311
And it's because when
you take them on and off,

27:26.311 --> 27:28.980
you're always putting pressure
on the frames like this.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.348
It causes 'em to spread.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.451

right here in the center,

27:33.451 --> 27:36.087

the bridge where it belongs,

27:36.087 --> 27:38.523
just like the tie rods
on a '72 Buick.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.759
Plus, I put a little
nose break on them here

27:40.759 --> 27:42.704
to prevent slippage. Try it.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.529
Use the handle.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.536
Well, I'll be...

27:50.902 --> 27:51.971
It works.

27:52.971 --> 27:56.174
You know, I make a pretty good
living selling shit like this.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.475
I'll tell you what,

27:57.475 --> 27:58.910
if I can develop this gizmo,

27:58.910 --> 28:00.412
I'll split it with you 50/50.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.614
Okay, how much do I owe you
for the gas?

28:02.614 --> 28:04.215
I got a trunk load of shit
to sell.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.583
$26.41.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.218
Here's $30.
Keep the change.

28:07.218 --> 28:08.492
Wow! Thanks.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.533
(madman)
Dead center!
Say your prayers, half-breed!

28:15.660 --> 28:17.434
[Bullet whizzing]

28:25.570 --> 28:28.050
Hey, Harry.
Look at this.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.052
What's the matter
with these cans?

28:32.043 --> 28:33.749
Die, Milk Face!

28:35.880 --> 28:37.282
[Chuckling]

28:37.282 --> 28:38.917
These cans are defective.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.518
They're springing leaks.

28:40.518 --> 28:41.928
Come over here
and look at this.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.823
Listen,
you better run for cover

28:44.823 --> 28:46.291
or you're gonna spring a leak.
Uh?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.792
We don't have
defective cans.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.532
We have a defective person
out there.

28:50.795 --> 28:52.069
[Gun fires]

28:52.564 --> 28:54.304
He hates these cans.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.469
Stay away from the cans!

28:57.969 --> 28:59.709
Die, gas pumper.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.741
I got to get away
from those cans.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.875
[Gun firing]

29:03.875 --> 29:05.752
There's cans in there, too.

29:07.011 --> 29:08.956
[Glass shattering]

29:09.848 --> 29:11.190
More cans.

29:12.317 --> 29:13.955
Die, you bastard.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.354
[Screaming]

29:16.354 --> 29:18.189
He doesn't want to put holes
in the cans.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.891
He wants to put holes in you.

29:19.891 --> 29:20.960
What?

29:22.193 --> 29:23.535
[Panting]

29:24.629 --> 29:26.665
Milk face bastard!

29:27.465 --> 29:30.101
Oh, my God.
I'm endangering your life.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.903
Cover me.
You're covered.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.939
Suck my toes!

29:39.244 --> 29:41.485
You stay here.
I'll distract him.

29:51.556 --> 29:52.898
[Gun firing]

29:56.761 --> 29:58.535
Shithead! Come on!

30:01.132 --> 30:03.805
Come on, boy. Good boy.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.369
"Carnival personnel only."
Damn.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.682
Shithead, come on!

30:43.441 --> 30:45.352
You're not carnival personnel!

30:48.813 --> 30:50.415
Come on, boy, come on.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.951
Hey, he ain't
no carnival personnel.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.252
[Trigger clicking]

30:54.252 --> 30:55.954
Okay, you move it out.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.364
[Engine starting]

31:02.794 --> 31:05.897
(Navin)
So, Mom, when I told
Mr. Hartounian I'd come back,

31:05.897 --> 31:08.766
he said "Don't be a putz.
See the world.

31:08.766 --> 31:10.472
Me, you've seen already."

31:10.735 --> 31:13.905
I took his advice and got
a job with SJM Fiesta Shows

31:13.905 --> 31:15.206
as a weight guesser.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.708
Frosty, my boss, told me

31:16.708 --> 31:19.344
there's a big future
in weight guessing.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.848
Enclosed is $4.75
for my loving family.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.258
P.S. Is Grandma still fartin'?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.253
(Navin)
For $1,

31:28.253 --> 31:31.359
I'll guess your weight,
your height, or your sex.

31:31.789 --> 31:34.492
The most exciting thing
on the midway.

31:34.492 --> 31:35.827
Imagine the thrill

31:35.827 --> 31:39.163
of getting your weight guessed
by a professional.

31:39.163 --> 31:42.200
You can blow up your cheeks,
you can stick out your chest,

31:42.200 --> 31:45.003
but you're not going
to fool the guesser.

31:45.003 --> 31:47.205
How about you, sir?
Step right up.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.240
Honey, let's see
how good this guy is.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.980
Now, what do I win?

31:52.076 --> 31:55.853
Uh, anything in this
general area, right in here.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.982
Anything below the stereo,

31:57.982 --> 32:00.351
and on this side
of the bicentennial glasses.

32:00.351 --> 32:04.230
Anything between
the ashtrays and the thimble.

32:04.522 --> 32:07.091
Anything in these
three inches.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.826
Right in here, in this area,

32:08.826 --> 32:11.596
that includes the Chiclets
but not the erasers.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.531
No, sir. Come on, honey.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.635
He thought
he had himself a rube.

32:18.569 --> 32:21.139
Frosty, I am just
no good at this.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.207
Oh, come on, Navin,
you're doing fine.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.476
No, I've already given away
eight pencils,

32:25.476 --> 32:27.145
two hula dolls,
and an ashtray,

32:27.145 --> 32:29.386
and I've only taken in $15.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.483
Navin, you have taken in $15

32:32.483 --> 32:35.259
and given away 50 cents'
worth of crap.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.857
Which gives us
a net profit of $14.50.

32:40.491 --> 32:41.992
Ah!

32:44.963 --> 32:47.102
It's a profit deal.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.272
[Chuckles]

32:50.101 --> 32:52.240
That takes the pressure off.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.839
Get your weight guessed
right here.

32:54.839 --> 32:56.307
Only $1.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.009
Actual live weight guessing.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.244
Take a chance
and win some crap.

33:00.244 --> 33:01.612

33:01.612 --> 33:06.017
(male announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,
I draw your attention now

33:06.017 --> 33:08.920
to the left side
of our midway,

33:08.920 --> 33:13.095
presenting the amazing
Patty Bernstein

33:14.625 --> 33:19.230
doing her special ride through
the Flaming Wall of Death.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.004
[People cheering]

33:50.595 --> 33:52.005
[Crowd whistling]

33:53.531 --> 33:54.771
[Belching]

34:25.263 --> 34:27.504
Wanna guess my weight,
greenie?

34:27.799 --> 34:30.134
I saw you last night.
You were great.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.536
Yeah, right.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.706
Turn around.

34:33.638 --> 34:34.809
What?

34:34.972 --> 34:36.382
Turn around.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.455
Go like this.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.324
You're okay.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.661
Give me a bite
of that corn dog.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.623
What about germs?

34:50.288 --> 34:52.027
Put a rubber on it.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.465
Get on.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.702
(Frosty)
Don't you wear him out.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.203
He's got to work tonight.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.415
What a great place.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.154
[Burping]

35:17.715 --> 35:20.118
You know, you can tell
so much about a person

35:20.118 --> 35:21.552
from the way they live.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.987
Just looking around here,

35:22.987 --> 35:26.024
I can tell you're
a genuinely dirty person.

35:30.528 --> 35:32.371
What do I do with this?

35:35.399 --> 35:37.276
Oh, you keep it there.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.276
[Sighing]

35:41.372 --> 35:43.181
Where's your garbage?

35:51.582 --> 35:53.417
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

35:53.417 --> 35:54.520
What?

35:55.686 --> 35:57.221
Guess your weight.

35:57.221 --> 35:59.223
Hey, that would be
interesting for me.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.559
No one has tried
to guess my weight.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.628
You see, I guess
their weights. It'd be sort...

36:03.628 --> 36:04.834
Put your arms up.

36:07.231 --> 36:10.769
This will give me
a whole different
perspective on this.

36:15.072 --> 36:17.814
(Navin)
Hey, you're really
trying to be accurate.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.517
Is it getting hot in here?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.118
[Gasping]

36:27.118 --> 36:28.920
Wait a minute!

36:28.920 --> 36:31.022
What's happening
to my special purpose?

36:31.022 --> 36:32.390
What's your
"special purpose"?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.691
Well, when I was a kid,

36:33.691 --> 36:36.227
my mom told me
that was my special purpose

36:36.227 --> 36:39.130
and someday I'd find out
what that special purpose was.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.798
Today's the day!

[Navin panting]

like a... a ride.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.408

36:50.408 --> 36:53.878
"My Dear Family, guess what?

my special purpose is for.

"Gosh,
what a great time I had.

could have been here with me.

And he's got the kisses here.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.589
That Patty
must be a sweet girl.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.090
God bless her.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.987
(Navin)
Do you ever think
we'll get to know each other

38:09.987 --> 38:11.889
well enough to kiss?

38:11.889 --> 38:14.369
(Patty)
We don't have to.
You're my man.

38:14.525 --> 38:17.096
It's like we're married.
Look at my ass.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.570
Gosh!

38:19.697 --> 38:23.303
You have my last name tattooed
right there under the "J's."

38:24.402 --> 38:26.470
First I get my name
in the phone book,

38:26.470 --> 38:28.540
and now I'm on your ass.

38:28.873 --> 38:32.411
You know, I'll bet more people
see that than the phone book.

Billy.

Billy.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.074
Woo-woo!

39:03.074 --> 39:05.509
Have you seen
a 5-year-old boy, blond hair,

39:05.509 --> 39:08.145
and he's wearing a T-shirt
that says "Bullshit" on it?

39:08.145 --> 39:10.314
No. There was
just one kid earlier,

39:10.314 --> 39:12.750
had a T-shirt that said
"Life sucks" on it.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.418
We got off the roundup
and he said

39:14.418 --> 39:16.020
he wanted to go on the trains.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.189
Well, I don't think...
There he is. Billy!

39:18.189 --> 39:19.557
(Navin)
Hey, come back here!

39:19.557 --> 39:21.092
Billy,
come on off that train!

39:21.092 --> 39:23.561
Pull that lever!
Pull the lever!
Here, hold that.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.995
And these.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.098
Billy!

39:26.731 --> 39:29.473
And take my keys.
And hold my wallet.

39:30.234 --> 39:31.302
Okay.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.304
Don't touch the Johnson bar.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.872
You'll explode
the fuel casing.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.541
And if the Wilson-Smith
indicator gets above 160,

39:37.541 --> 39:38.809
just turn that little...

39:38.809 --> 39:41.178
Billy, I can't take you
anywhere anymore!

39:41.178 --> 39:42.713
There's a little
screwdriver there.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.715
Just put it in,
turn it one-quarter.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.317
We're going
into the tunnel.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.186
Don't stand up
because the clearance
is only four foot...

39:49.186 --> 39:50.528
Oh, no!

39:50.654 --> 39:53.657
I'm okay.
I was protected by the bill
of my Engineer Fred cap.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.611
[Panting]

40:09.840 --> 40:11.979
Thanks for
pulling my cap down.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.250
Oh, Billy.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.215
Billy, you scared me
half to death.

40:18.215 --> 40:19.884
Thank you so much.

40:19.884 --> 40:23.220
It would have been
so embarrassing to go home
without Billy.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.891
Oh, here's your gloves
and your oil can

40:26.891 --> 40:30.031
and your wallet.
Oh, and this fell out.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.538
[Exclaiming]

40:33.564 --> 40:35.134
Those guys.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.770
Listen, what you did just now
was very brave.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.141
Is there some way
I could repay you?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.041
Repay me?

40:44.041 --> 40:46.110
I could never accept
anything from you

40:46.110 --> 40:47.511
for saving your child.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.388
Oh, he's not my child.

40:49.647 --> 40:51.717
I'm just babysitting
for a friend.

40:52.049 --> 40:54.756
Oh! Would it be too much
if I asked for a kiss?

40:54.952 --> 40:55.987
No.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.460
He's a real little dickens.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.003
Thank you.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.246
Oh, Miss?

41:18.576 --> 41:21.181
I was... I was just
standing here right now and

41:21.412 --> 41:24.825
I was wondering if you weren't
doing anything tomorrow

41:27.451 --> 41:30.727
that maybe you might wanna
go out or...

41:32.223 --> 41:33.326
What?

41:34.925 --> 41:39.339
[Babbling]
I thought maybe you might
wanna go out with me.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.608
Are you trying to ask me
for a date?

41:43.634 --> 41:44.874
Well...

41:45.703 --> 41:48.809
Once for no, twice for yes.

41:52.309 --> 41:53.310
Okay.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.753
Um, you're so cute.

41:57.281 --> 42:00.751
How about 3:30 tomorrow
at the roundup?

42:00.751 --> 42:02.059
Okay.

42:05.122 --> 42:06.965
Do you have
any boyfriends?

42:08.926 --> 42:10.060
Not really.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.562
Are they crazy?

42:11.562 --> 42:14.231
If I was a fella,
I'd be around all the time.

42:14.231 --> 42:16.404
Well, see if you can
work it out.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.336
We have a date tomorrow.

42:20.504 --> 42:21.983
What's your name?

42:23.240 --> 42:24.377
Marie.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.111
What's yours?

42:27.111 --> 42:28.812
I'll tell you tomorrow.

42:28.812 --> 42:31.792
It'll give us something
interesting to talk about.

42:49.133 --> 42:50.407
Hi.

42:50.534 --> 42:52.274
What's up, hubby?

42:54.238 --> 42:56.012
I got these for you.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.218
Thanks.

43:00.878 --> 43:04.281
Navin, you know the other day
when I showed you the tattoo?

43:04.281 --> 43:05.521
Yeah. Yeah.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.218
Well, I forgot
to tell you somethin'.

43:08.218 --> 43:09.787
Oh, really? What?

43:09.787 --> 43:11.129
This.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.763
And that's
what's gonna happen to you

43:19.763 --> 43:22.266
if I ever catch you looking
at another broad.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.867
I'm glad you told me.

43:23.867 --> 43:27.712
And remember,
I did this without anger.

43:28.539 --> 43:30.780
And I stayed away
from your crotch.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.214
Bye, sweetie.

43:36.680 --> 43:37.886
Hi.

43:38.148 --> 43:39.422
What happened?

43:39.717 --> 43:42.886
Oh, it was unbelievable.
These guys jumped me.

43:42.886 --> 43:44.521
Tried to get these flowers.

43:44.521 --> 43:45.990
I got 'em for you.

43:45.990 --> 43:48.470
It's kind of
a traditional date deal.

43:48.959 --> 43:51.996
Yeah, I've heard of that.
What were they?

43:52.696 --> 43:54.971
Uh, couple of dozen roses.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.735
Look like daisy stems.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.169
What?

43:59.169 --> 44:01.205
That guy gypped me.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.907
He put... put daisy stems
on my roses.

44:03.907 --> 44:05.242
[Laughing]

44:05.242 --> 44:07.478
Hey, look,
these hoodlums are dangerous.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.981
I think we ought to get out
of here before she sees us.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.082
She?

44:12.082 --> 44:13.150
What?

44:13.150 --> 44:14.551
You said "she."

44:14.551 --> 44:17.588
No. No.
I always call a gang "she."

44:17.788 --> 44:19.857
It's like
when you call a boat "she,"

44:19.857 --> 44:21.659
or... or a hurricane "she."

44:21.659 --> 44:23.001
Or a girl?

44:23.360 --> 44:25.195
A girl.
You can call a girl "she."

44:25.195 --> 44:28.039
That's just one of the many
things you can call "she."

44:29.233 --> 44:30.834
[Men chattering]

44:30.834 --> 44:32.608
(Marie)
Why are you smiling?

44:33.404 --> 44:36.384
(Navin)
You're the first person
I've ever had in my place.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.376
Do you live here?
Oh, it's nice.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.178
So, did you decorate it?

44:41.178 --> 44:43.313
I got all this stuff from
the old Cup O' Pizza place

44:43.313 --> 44:45.156
before they tore it down.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.754
That was really good pizza.

44:50.754 --> 44:52.756
Oh, this is the best
pizza in a cup ever.

44:52.756 --> 44:54.358
This guy's unbelievable.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.560
He ran the old Cup O' Pizza
guy out of business.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.661
Really?

44:57.661 --> 45:00.107
People come from all over
to get this. Uh-huh.

45:02.332 --> 45:03.333
[Sighing]

45:13.143 --> 45:16.055
You know,
you have beautiful skin.

45:19.249 --> 45:20.523
May I?

45:21.318 --> 45:22.387
Yes.

45:27.091 --> 45:29.366
So smooth and flexible.

45:30.494 --> 45:33.397
I take after my mother's side
of the family.

45:33.397 --> 45:37.345
It's amazing the way it just
snaps back like that. Amazing.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.404
Are you a model?

45:40.404 --> 45:41.439
No.

45:43.774 --> 45:45.548
I'm a cosmetologist.

45:46.143 --> 45:48.680
Really? A cosmetologist?

45:49.813 --> 45:53.351
That's unbelievable.
That's impressive.

45:54.418 --> 45:57.023
It must be tough to handle
the weightlessness.

45:59.022 --> 46:01.434
Can I ask you
a personal question?

46:02.593 --> 46:03.969
What is it?

46:05.863 --> 46:07.740
Now be totally honest.

46:09.066 --> 46:11.045
You do have a boyfriend,
don't you?

46:11.668 --> 46:13.044
Kind of.

46:15.038 --> 46:17.245
I know this is our first date

46:19.343 --> 46:20.981
but do you think

46:21.211 --> 46:24.157
the next time you make love
to your boyfriend,

46:25.282 --> 46:26.886
you could think of me?

46:27.351 --> 46:29.421
Well, I haven't
made love to him yet.

46:29.953 --> 46:31.295
That's too bad.

46:32.256 --> 46:35.259
Do you think
it's possible that some day

46:37.127 --> 46:39.830
you could make love with me
and think of him?

46:39.830 --> 46:41.172
Who knows?

46:41.331 --> 46:44.471
Maybe you and he can make love
and you could think of me.

46:46.270 --> 46:48.943
I'd just be happy
to be in there somewhere.

47:05.556 --> 47:07.224
Do you have a girlfriend?

47:07.224 --> 47:08.525
Does it matter?

47:08.525 --> 47:11.028
Well, I'd like to think
you were available.

47:11.361 --> 47:12.965
Oh, I'm available.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.009
Did you forget
about my ass?

47:26.009 --> 47:28.545
No! No, I've been
thinking about it.

47:28.545 --> 47:30.814
She tattooed my name
on her ass.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.953
Not just my name,
a lot of names.

47:33.217 --> 47:34.818
And funny sayings, too.

47:34.818 --> 47:37.588
She's got one up there that
says, "Slippery when wet."

47:37.588 --> 47:38.889
How do you know that?

47:38.889 --> 47:40.891
What is she?
Some great piece of ass?

47:40.891 --> 47:42.700
She's no great piece of ass.

47:43.594 --> 47:44.862
I mean, uh...

47:44.862 --> 47:47.231
Hey, wait... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

47:47.231 --> 47:50.100
We're all adults here.
Let's reason this out.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.836
Now Marie is the type
of person that if you gotta...

47:52.836 --> 47:55.339
If this gash doesn't
get her buns out of here,

47:55.339 --> 47:57.741
I am gonna drive this bike
up her butt!

47:57.741 --> 47:59.720
While Patty
tends to be more direct.

47:59.843 --> 48:01.311
As for you, farm boy,

48:01.311 --> 48:02.579
[grunts]

48:02.579 --> 48:03.750
We're married!

48:04.147 --> 48:06.092
And as for you,
kewpie doll...

48:09.519 --> 48:10.888
You protected me!

48:10.888 --> 48:12.867
You must really like me.

48:18.362 --> 48:22.969
(Navin and Marie)
I know, I know, you belong

48:23.533 --> 48:28.209
To somebody new

48:29.006 --> 48:31.375
But tonight

48:31.375 --> 48:35.721
You belong to me

48:39.616 --> 48:44.531
Although,
although we're apart

48:44.855 --> 48:49.770
You're a part of my heart

48:50.260 --> 48:52.603
And tonight

48:52.996 --> 48:57.137
You belong to me

49:00.904 --> 49:03.281
Way down

49:03.674 --> 49:05.619
By the stream

49:06.276 --> 49:08.551
How sweet

49:08.879 --> 49:10.983
It will seem

49:11.548 --> 49:16.155
Once more, just to dream

49:16.853 --> 49:19.356
In the moonlight

49:20.757 --> 49:24.828
My Honey, I know, I know

49:24.828 --> 49:27.240
With the dawn

49:27.497 --> 49:30.133
That you

49:30.133 --> 49:32.306
Will be gone

49:32.569 --> 49:34.878
But tonight

49:35.339 --> 49:39.287
You belong to me

49:39.509 --> 49:42.012
Just to little old me

49:43.313 --> 49:44.621
[playing]

50:13.477 --> 50:14.853
You know,

50:16.179 --> 50:18.281
while you were
playing that just now,

50:18.281 --> 50:19.916
[waves breaking]

50:19.916 --> 50:22.419
I had the craziest
fantasy that I could

50:23.620 --> 50:24.655
rise up.

50:25.655 --> 50:29.000
Float right down
the end of this cornet.

50:30.127 --> 50:31.662
Right through here.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.537
Through these valves,

50:34.498 --> 50:36.409
right along this tube,

50:37.434 --> 50:39.573
come right up
against your lips,

50:40.504 --> 50:41.880
and give you a kiss.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.649
Why didn't you?

50:47.744 --> 50:49.951
I didn't want to get
spit on me.

51:23.580 --> 51:34.695
[Grunting]

51:36.793 --> 51:39.170
[Both panting]

51:42.599 --> 51:44.442
Was it good for you, too?

51:48.405 --> 51:50.077
I really do want to kiss you.

51:52.742 --> 51:54.016
But I'm afraid.

51:55.078 --> 51:56.813
I would've kept
my tongue in.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.257
No, I mean,

52:01.051 --> 52:03.030
I'm afraid if I kiss you,

52:05.055 --> 52:06.829
I'll fall in love with you.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.428
You will?

52:10.460 --> 52:12.269
And I don't want to.

52:13.530 --> 52:14.667
You don't?

52:16.666 --> 52:18.435
My mother
sacrificed everything

52:18.435 --> 52:20.812
to send me through
cosmetology school.

52:21.271 --> 52:22.340
She did?

52:24.007 --> 52:26.646
She has this dream
for me to be something.

52:27.544 --> 52:28.579
She does?

52:30.347 --> 52:33.191
To marry someone with power,

52:34.217 --> 52:35.889
money, vision.

52:37.787 --> 52:40.199
Someone with
a special purpose.

52:43.493 --> 52:44.937
I've got one!

52:45.996 --> 52:48.131
I've got a special purpose!

52:48.131 --> 52:49.432
You do?

52:49.432 --> 52:51.601
[Exclaiming]
Yes, it's fantastic!

52:51.601 --> 52:54.479
It's great!
It's unbelievable!

52:54.971 --> 52:56.940
And I was afraid
to tell you about it!

52:56.940 --> 52:58.817
Your mother's gonna love me!

53:01.845 --> 53:03.949
Marie, are you awake?

53:06.082 --> 53:07.151
Good.

53:09.352 --> 53:11.525
You look so beautiful
and peaceful,

53:11.721 --> 53:13.598
you almost look dead.

53:16.526 --> 53:18.061
And I'm glad because

53:18.428 --> 53:21.097
there's something
I wanna say that's
always been very difficult

53:21.097 --> 53:22.803
for me to say.

53:24.234 --> 53:25.936
I slit the sheet,
the sheet I slit,

53:25.936 --> 53:27.676
and on the slitted sheet
I sit.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.008
I've never been
relaxed enough

53:32.008 --> 53:34.249
around anyone
to be able to say that.

53:35.345 --> 53:37.415
You give me confidence
in myself.

53:39.149 --> 53:41.117
I know we've only known
each other

53:41.117 --> 53:43.096
for four weeks
and three days,

53:43.553 --> 53:44.793
but to me

53:45.188 --> 53:47.634
it seems like
nine weeks and five days.

53:49.626 --> 53:51.765
The first day
seemed like a week.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.842
And the second day
seemed like five days.

53:56.967 --> 53:59.140
And the third day
seemed like a week again.

53:59.803 --> 54:02.749
And the fourth day
seemed like eight days.

54:03.773 --> 54:06.549
But the fifth day,
you went to see your mother.

54:07.210 --> 54:09.121
And that seemed
just like a day.

54:10.146 --> 54:12.819
But then you
came back and later

54:13.717 --> 54:16.629
on the sixth day,
in the evening,
when we saw each other,

54:16.987 --> 54:20.332
that started seeming
like two days.

54:21.191 --> 54:22.692
So in the evening,
it seemed like

54:22.692 --> 54:24.995
two days spilling over
into the next day.

54:24.995 --> 54:27.163
And that started
seeming like four days.

54:27.163 --> 54:29.404
So at the end
of the sixth day,

54:29.766 --> 54:33.213
on into the seventh day,
it seemed like
a total of five days.

54:34.337 --> 54:37.545
And the sixth day
seemed like

54:38.174 --> 54:39.812
a week and a half.

54:41.177 --> 54:42.412
I have it written down

54:42.412 --> 54:45.654
but I can... I can show it
to you tomorrow
if you wanna see it.

54:46.716 --> 54:50.459
Anyway,
I've decided that tomorrow,

54:51.388 --> 54:52.958
when the time is right,

54:54.357 --> 54:55.995
I'm gonna ask
you to marry me.

54:58.795 --> 55:00.501
If that's okay with you.

55:01.031 --> 55:03.010
Just don't say anything.

55:07.437 --> 55:09.507
You've made me very happy.

55:18.114 --> 55:22.419
Oh, I'll see you again

55:22.419 --> 55:26.662
Whenever spring
breaks through again

55:27.724 --> 55:29.294
(Navin)
Honey, sing!

55:31.594 --> 55:35.098
Time may lie heavy between

55:35.098 --> 55:36.804
But what has been

55:37.467 --> 55:40.880
Is past forgetting

55:41.571 --> 55:45.608
This sweet memory

55:45.608 --> 55:48.278
Across the years,
will come

55:48.278 --> 55:50.146
[Marie playing cornet]

55:50.146 --> 55:51.886
To me

55:52.115 --> 55:54.150
Though my world

55:54.150 --> 55:56.892
May go awry

55:57.153 --> 56:00.056
In my heart

56:00.056 --> 56:02.331
Will ever lie

56:02.926 --> 56:06.805
Just the echo of a sigh

56:11.334 --> 56:12.642
Goodbye

56:13.737 --> 56:17.116
(Navin)
Honey, who's the happiest guy
in the world?

56:18.842 --> 56:20.048
You are.

56:20.443 --> 56:22.011
That's right.

56:22.011 --> 56:24.388
And who's the happiest gal?

56:25.248 --> 56:26.658
[Shithead yelping]

56:26.950 --> 56:28.451
That's right.

56:28.818 --> 56:30.053
(Navin)
Honey, guess what?

56:30.053 --> 56:32.089
I wrote a song
for you this morning.

56:32.522 --> 56:36.299
Oh, I'm picking out
a thermos for you

56:37.193 --> 56:40.731
Not an ordinary
thermos for you

56:41.197 --> 56:44.872
But the extra-best thermos
you can buy

56:45.034 --> 56:48.413
With vinyl and stripes
and a cup built right in

56:48.705 --> 56:52.311
I'm picking out a thermos
for you

56:52.776 --> 56:55.813
And maybe a barometer, too

56:56.146 --> 57:00.025
And what else can I buy
so on me you'll rely

57:00.283 --> 57:02.660
A rear-end
thermometer, too

57:02.886 --> 57:04.194
(Navin)
Honey?

57:04.354 --> 57:06.857
There's a question
I've been wanting to pop,

57:07.123 --> 57:09.227
but I've been
afraid you'd say no.

57:09.793 --> 57:12.695
But this seems like
the right time and place.

57:12.695 --> 57:14.037
So here goes.

57:15.432 --> 57:18.037
Honey, will you marry me?

57:18.268 --> 57:19.610
[Barking]

57:19.903 --> 57:21.838
Yahoo!

57:21.838 --> 57:24.113
Come on,
let's seal it with a kiss!

57:24.340 --> 57:26.012
Get in the tub with me!

57:27.544 --> 57:30.081
Not you, Shithead!
Where's Marie?

57:30.313 --> 57:31.514
[Shithead barking]

57:31.514 --> 57:33.015
What letter?

57:40.890 --> 57:42.562
"Dear Navin."

57:42.926 --> 57:44.405
[Gibbering]

57:48.498 --> 57:49.874

57:52.302 --> 57:53.644
...to be...

57:59.642 --> 58:01.911
Marie! Marie!

58:01.911 --> 58:04.214
[Shithead barking]
(Navin)
Shithead, come here.

58:04.214 --> 58:05.615
Good idea.

58:05.615 --> 58:08.618
Marie! Marie,
why did you leave me?

58:08.618 --> 58:11.155
I couldn't read the letter.
It was too blurry.

58:11.421 --> 58:13.594
Marie! Marie!

58:13.990 --> 58:15.458
[Growling]
Here, boy.

58:15.458 --> 58:21.297
Marie! Marie!

58:21.931 --> 58:23.501
Where are you, Marie?

58:27.403 --> 58:30.440
Marie! Marie!

58:40.650 --> 58:42.595
This is not gonna be easy,
Shithead.

58:43.987 --> 58:46.228
We've been together
a long time.

58:46.956 --> 58:49.026
But I gotta head down
that road.

58:50.593 --> 58:52.395
And there'll be times
out there

58:52.395 --> 58:54.875
when there won't be
enough food for two.

58:55.064 --> 58:56.733
And I won't be able to...

58:56.733 --> 58:58.635
Hey, wait a minute!

58:58.635 --> 59:00.336
I-I'm not done yet!

59:00.336 --> 59:02.305
Come back.
I'm not finished.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.250
I have some more
to tell you.

59:07.076 --> 59:09.679
You'll find a family
who can give you a real home,

59:09.679 --> 59:12.659
with loving kids
and a warm fireplace.

59:13.349 --> 59:15.385
I never liked you, anyway.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.262
Now get out of here!

59:18.388 --> 59:21.164
Okay! Okay!
You win. You can go with me.

59:25.495 --> 59:26.629
(Navin)
So, Mom,

59:26.629 --> 59:29.006
with my faithful dog
leading the way,

59:29.499 --> 59:31.740
I'm out to win
the hand of Marie.

59:32.335 --> 59:35.077
You'd love her, Ma.
She looks just like you.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.346
Except she's white and blond.

59:38.107 --> 59:41.711
So, to win her back,
I vowed to make
something of myself.

59:41.711 --> 59:44.614
I settled in Los Angeles
and took the money I saved

59:44.614 --> 59:46.749
and rented my
first apartment.

59:46.749 --> 59:48.451
"I haven't heard from Marie.

59:48.451 --> 59:49.719
[Hen clucking]

59:49.719 --> 59:51.020
"Things couldn't be worse.

59:51.020 --> 59:53.556
I can only send you
49 cents this week..."

59:53.556 --> 59:55.124
Oh, bless his heart.

59:55.124 --> 59:56.659
That's a good boy.

59:56.659 --> 59:58.763
"...as I've lost all my jobs.

59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.230

eating well, though.

is give them a pint of blood.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.707
I ate there all week.
Three times a day."

A pint of blood?

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.476
"I decided to quit

It's him.

Him?

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.477

to sign for this.

I have to sign
before you shoot me?

I'm not gonna shoot you.

Why not?

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.132
That was the old me.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.631
I was a little mixed-up
at that time.

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:14.235
Had a bad marriage
and I just gave up smoking.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.501
I'm okay now.

Mmm-hmm.

There. Now, we are complete.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:25.041
Putting on Mask-O Derm
just took a few short minutes

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.843

he will look 20 years younger.

Yes, exactly.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:32.648
Now we'll let this dry.

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.717
In the meantime,
we can go pick out

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.719
an eye shadow
and lip tint for him.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.788

follow me this way

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:41.090
because this is
a very interesting line.

With your husband's coloring,

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:47.329
a deep tone would
bring out his lips.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:51.572
And this Nature Beige
will feature his eyes
just wonderfully.

Let's try everything.

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:57.574

to peel off our Mask-O Derm.

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.689
Irving's skin will
be tighter, firmer,

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.054
and he'll look like
a different man.

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.430
You'll be amazed.

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:33.716
Jeez! This shit
really worked.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.314
Navin.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.585
Oh, my sweetheart.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.685
[All gasping]

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:47.022
What are you doing
to my husband,
you Miss Blondie? Irving!

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.890
Irving, are you crazy?

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.359
(Navin)
"Dear Mom.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.294
"The big news is,
Marie and I were married.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.500
"We couldn't wait.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.999
"Luckily, we found someone at
the Hollywood View Apartments,

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.001
"who could marry us
immediately.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.537
"He was a certified priest.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.380
[Exclaims]

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:06.845
"We were both glad
we had a religious wedding.

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.515
"Money hasn't changed
our lives that much.

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.779
"Our one little
extravagance is

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.883
a live-in butler
and housekeeper."

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.117
Another check!

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.218
[Chuckles]

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.663
Just as I thought.
Look at that.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.162
Nearly $750,000.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.660
Sir, it would seem
with this kind of income,
you could buy a larger house

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.332
with proper
servants' quarters.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.031
(Navin)
"Mom, remember my dream
of owning

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.698
"a big house on a hill?

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:32.939
"How I used to
wish for a living room

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:35.343
"with a plaster lion
in it from Mexico?

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:39.241
"And how I always wanted
a large 24-seat dining table?

"In a dining room
with original oil paintings

"by Michelangelo
and Rembrandt?

"And remember how
I always wanted a rotating bed

"with pink chiffon
and zebra stripes?

"And remember how
I used to chitchat with Dad

"about always wanting
a bathtub shaped like a clam?

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:59.966
"And an office with orange
and white stripes?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.764
"And remember
how much I wanted

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:04.676
"an all-red billiard room

"And how I wanted
a disco room
with my own disco dancers?

with fancy friends?

"And remember
how much I wanted

"a big back yard

a substantial penalty

"for early withdrawal.

Enclosed is
this week's check.
Love, Navin."

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.388
Sorry about
your wife, Hobart.

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.692
Federal regulations, sir.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.890
Oh, dear me.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.562
Your wife has given you

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.434
another gold chain.

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:04.734
I'd nearly forgotten.

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:09.164
[Sighing]
I suppose, I'm still not quite
over Hester's death.

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:10.833
Well, these things take time.

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:11.967
Yes.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.913
So I'm told.
Oh, here's your drink, sir.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.208
Like the one you
saw in the magazine.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:20.317
You got the bamboo umbrella
and everything.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:26.289
See that? Be somebody.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:31.790
Very good, sir.
Very good.

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.757
Oh, uh,

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.396
there are some charity people
here to see you, sir.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.003
No! Send them away!

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:43.032
There's a lot of people
more deserving than me.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:45.637
Ah, but these people
want you to give.

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:48.771
Oh.

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:51.708
Okay.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.977
My name is
Father Carlos Las
Vegas De Cordoba.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.284
Father, you seem
like a religious man.

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.422
How can I help you?

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.890
By giving me three minutes
of your time

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.820
so that you can see some film

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.596
of a great ugliness
that is spreading
in my country.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.400
Oh, God.
I'll bet it's disgusting.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:13.762
Hobart?

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:14.863
Yes, sir?

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.099
Are you over your grief
enough yet to dim the lights?

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:18.701
[Chuckling]
Of course, sir.

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.737
Well, one can't mourn forever.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:24.077
You will not believe
what you are about to see.

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:27.512
That human beings
could have sunk so low

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.778
that they can take
pleasure to do this

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.714
to another
of God's creatures.

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.853
I hope you have
a strong stomach, senor.

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:35.893
Roll the ugliness.

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:16.525
Good Lord.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.971
I've heard about
this cat juggling.

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.071
[Men hooting]

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:41.092
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.053
Good.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:49.295
Father, could there be a God
that would let this happen?

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.296
How much do you want?

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.173
(man)
If your initial investment
is $500,000,

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.771
and your apartments
are up in March,

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.570
you should have
"X" amount of dollars

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.806
rolling in
by the end of this year.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:06.875
(Navin)
Ah! "X" amount.
That's very good, isn't it?

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.811
(Man #2)
Not only that,
you can depreciate

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.746
the entire building
for the full amount.

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:13.351
(Navin)
Depreciate? Very good.
Hmm. I like that.

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.685
We found a way
to get around
this Fair Housing crap.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:19.529
Ah! Good.
Getting around the crap.
That's good.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.959
By keeping the rents high,
we're going to appeal to
a select class of people.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.961
Select class.
Very, very good.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.064
We'll keep the eggplants out.

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.767
Ah, good.
We don't want any vegetables.

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.136
No, no.
The jungle bunnies.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.240
Of course.
They'll eat the vegetables.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.312
Boss?
Can I... can I talk to him?

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.078
We're gonna keep out
the niggers.

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.079
The what?

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:46.281
The niggers.
We'll keep 'em out.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.382
Yeah.

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:51.330
Sir, you are talking
to a nigger!

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.300
[Screaming]

01:14:56.859 --> 01:15:03.573

(Marie)
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:43.879
How could you know
that was Iron Balls McGinty?

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.575
Your escargots. Salad.

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:48.213
[People chattering]

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:51.380
Would monsieur care
for another bottle
of the Chateau Latour?

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.850
Ah, yes, but no more 1966.
Let's splurge.

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.852
Bring us some fresh wine.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.186
The freshest you've got.

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.791
This year's.
No more of this old stuff.

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.265
Oui, monsieur.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:06.963
He doesn't realize
he's dealing with
sophisticated people here.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.232
Marie, now just stay calm.
Stay calm.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.533
(Navin)
Just don't look down.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:13.268
Don't look down!
Look up!

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:16.112
Just keep your eyes up
and keep them that way, okay?
Waiter!

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:21.743
There are snails
on her plate.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.313
[Squealing]

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.715
Now get them out of here
before she sees them.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:29.525
Look away! Just look away!
And keep your eyes that way!

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:32.854
You'd think at
a fancy restaurant like this,
at these prices,

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:35.698
you would be able
to keep the snails
off the food!

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:39.027
There're so many snails
in there, you can't even
see the food!

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.429
Now take them away
and bring me

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.332
those melted cheese
sandwich appetizers
you talked me out of!

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.776
Oui, monsieur.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.436
Do you believe this?

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.838
First, they didn't have
the bamboo umbrellas
for the wine

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.473
and now snails
on the food.

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:54.351
(Navin)
Two boobs!
That's what he takes us for!

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.117
[Honking]

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.123
Hi, honey.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.423
Hi, doll face.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:09.858
Everything okay?

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:13.669
Remember how you told me
to take unnecessary lessons?

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.198
Well, I just took
a lesson.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.799
And a very
good student, too.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.701
Adios, senora.
Adios.

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.339
You took bullfighting?

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.413
No. Knife-throwing.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.486
(Navin)
Knife-throwing is great!

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.087
I can almost do it.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.012
Well, let me
see your stuff.

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.547
Okay.

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.716
This is very good
for a beginner.

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.729
This is exciting.
I love this!

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.592
Come on.

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:45.594
(Marie)
Turn sideways.
Okay.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:48.074
And put a balloon
in your mouth.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.169
Do you have a balloon?

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.777
Uh, no.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.711
Oh, wait. Yes.

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:56.109
(Marie)
Okay.

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.674
Is it in your mouth?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:17:59.775
Uh-huh!

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:02.346
Throw 'em good
and hard so they'll stick.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:04.319
Okay.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:08.651
One,

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.654
two,

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.189
three!

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.325
Four, five, six!

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.661
Oh!

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:21.669
I missed.

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.665
Honey, you did good.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.674
I can't do anything right.

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:30.276
Honey, you worry too much.

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:35.179
Come on. Let's flop this over
and look at it another way.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:38.513
Why, do you realize
in the past two short months,

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:41.049
we have acquired
the sophistication

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:43.927
it takes some people
a lifetime to acquire?

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.528
Come on!

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.361
Let's toast!

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:49.056
(woman)
Everybody, Navin's on TV.
Marie, it's Navin!

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:52.454
Oh, honey, here's that
interview you did on TV.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.423
Shut off the music!
Shut it off!
Shut off the music!

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:58.293
Everyone,
we're going to watch Navin
on the TV.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:01.239
Now, sit down.
Just sit on the floor.
Sit around.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.799
(Clete Roberts)
American Time Newsmagazine,

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.903
turns its probing eye
on Navin Johnson,

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.808
inventor of the Opti-Grab.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.238
That little glasses handle
that sold

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.877
10 million units in
a few short months.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.785
(Clete Roberts)
Mr. Johnson, you've become
a millionaire overnight.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.319
Who are you?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.254
Who is Navin Johnson?

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.886
Navin is
a complex personality,

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:27.389
as are most of
the small breed

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.835
of modern-day
Renaissance millionaires.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.795
(Clete Roberts)
We had planned to show you
the entire Johnson interview.

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:35.764
However, when we
returned to our studio,

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.666
our news department
informed us

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.840
of a sensational development
in the Johnson story.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.772
It seems that
an irate group of citizens

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:46.808
led by the celebrity
Mr. Carl Reiner,

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:49.945
has filed a class-action suit
against Mr. Johnson

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:51.413
and his Opti-Grab.

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:54.482
Here's what Mr. Reiner had
to say at a press conference.

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:57.719
When Opti-Grab came out,
I thought it was
the greatest thing ever.

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:58.959
And I bought a pair.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:01.093
And this is the result.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.460
[All gasping]

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.960
(Carl)
This little handle is
like a magnet.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.067
Your eyes are
constantly drawn to it
and you end up cockeyed.

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:12.904
Now, as a director,
I am constantly using my eyes.

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.103
And this Opti-Grab
device has caused

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.014
irreparable harm to my career.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:19.814
Let me show you
a clip from my latest film,

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:22.216
where my faulty
depth perception kept me

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.619
from yelling "cut"
at the proper time.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:28.920
(Carl)
Cut!

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:40.162
(Carl)
If I had yelled "cut" on time,

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.741
those actors
would be alive today.

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:47.442
That's why I'm spearheading
the $10-million
class-action suit

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:51.377
against Mr. Johnson
and his irresponsible
selling of a product,

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:54.177
he didn't even test
on prisoners.

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.011
Thank you.

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:58.380
(woman)
The party's over.
Nouveau riche.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.282
You know what I mean?

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:02.918
What is this?
Hey, wait a second.
Where are you going?

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.552
(man)
This guy's something else.

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:06.759
I'm gonna get in touch
with that Reiner guy.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.091
I got some... I got some
change upstairs.

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.197
We'll get some, uh,
potato chips and
there's some beer up there.

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:15.670
We'll make it
a less formal thing.

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.198
[Crowd chattering]

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.041
(man)
Let's find another party.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:25.115
Honey!
Why the gloom?

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.509
It's not the end
of the rainbow.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.579
I'm Navin Johnson,
inventor!

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:34.525
This is no big deal.
It's a parking ticket to me.

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:37.827
Only instead of $5,
it's $10,000,000.

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.861
I don't care about
losing all the money.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.234
It's losing all the stuff.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.565
We're not gonna
lose the stuff.

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.031
[Chuckling]

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.733
This is America!

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:55.703
We're gonna receive
a fair trial from
an impartial jury.

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.339
[Mallet pounding]

01:22:57.339 --> 01:23:00.513
Your Honor, we, the jury,
find for the plaintiff.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.217
[People applauding]

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.718
I award, to Mr. Reiner

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.586
and the other nine million

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:14.255
nine hundred and 87 thousand

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.826
six hundred
and 52 plaintiffs,

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.402
the full amount of the suit.

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.375
Court is adjourned!

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.734
[People applauding]

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:30.910
Navin.

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:32.882
Honey, can't you see
I'm drinking?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.918
Pay to the order of

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.188
Mrs. Wilbur Stark

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:49.200
$1.09!

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.546
Pay to the order of

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.654
Iron Balls McGinty

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:15.625
$1.09!

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:18.953
Why are you crying?

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:21.156
And why are you
wearing that old dress?

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:23.324
Because I just heard
a song on the radio

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.394
that reminded me
of the way we were.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.128
What was it?

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:28.504
The Way We Were.

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:31.474
[Sniffling]
Look at us.
We've hit bottom.

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:35.770
No! Maybe you've hit bottom,
but I haven't hit bottom yet!

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.282
I've got a ways to go!

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.744
And I'm gonna bounce back!

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.285
And when I do,

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.922
I'm gonna buy you
a diamond so big

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:48.251
it's gonna make you puke.

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.252
I don't wanna puke!

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.026
I don't want wealth!

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.659
I just want you
like you used to be.

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.993
What happened to that man?

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.437
Me?

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:03.271
What happened to
the girl I believed in?

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.008
The girl I fell in love with.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:08.170
The girl that believed in me.

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.273
There's plenty of places
I can go,

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.242
where people
believe in me.

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.577
Well, go!

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:17.645
The sooner
you're out of my life,

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.848
the sooner I can go back
to being the girl

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.749
in this little flowered dress

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:25.788
that you sang
the thermos song to.

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.996
Well, I'm gonna go, then!

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:32.026
And I don't need any of this!
I don't need this stuff!

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.297
And I don't need you!
I don't need anything!

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.202
Except this.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.010
This ashtray.
The only thing I need is this!

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:47.182
I don't need this or this.
Just this ashtray!

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.287
And this paddle game.

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:54.453
The ashtray
and the paddle game.
And that's all I need!

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.419
And this remote control.

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.955
The ashtray, the paddle game,
and the remote control.

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.593
And that's all I need!

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.438
And these matches.

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:10.098
The ashtray and these matches

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:12.771
and the remote control
and the paddle ball.

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:15.939
This lamp.

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:19.546
The ashtray,

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:24.453
this paddle game
and the remote control,

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.986
and the lamp.
And that's all I need.

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.024
[Crying]

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:33.089
And that's all I need, too.

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:36.358
I don't need one other thing!

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:38.570
Not one...
I need this.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.731
The paddle game and the chair,

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:47.405
and the remote control
and the matches, for sure!

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.512
(Navin)
Wh-what are you looking at?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.243
What do you think I am?
Some kind of
a jerk or something?

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:57.551
[Sobbing]

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.519
And this.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.088
That's all I need.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.565
The ashtray,

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:12.763
the remote control
and this paddle game,

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.231
and this magazine
and the chair.

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.973
[Sobbing]

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:24.706
And I don't need
one other thing.

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.608
Except my dog.

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:27.916
[Growling]

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.980
I don't need my dog.

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.890
(Navin)
So, that's it.

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.327
It's an old story.

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:47.022
One you've probably
heard before.

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.194
[Cars honking]

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.904
But I never thought
it would happen to me.

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.472
[Sighing]

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.044
[Car honking]

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:08.753
(Taj)
Hey! Any of you bums ever
heard of Navin R. Johnson?

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:12.923
I've heard of him.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.491
Born in Mississippi?

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:16.851
Uh-huh!

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.762
Inventor of the Opti-Grab?

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.356
I was just
telling these guys.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.459
Son!

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:27.265
Daddy!

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.198
Navin.

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.299
Mom!

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:32.402
My baby!

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.303
Navin.
Elvira!

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.975
I knew we'd find you.

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:39.682
Taj!
Don't kiss me.

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:41.809
[All laughing]

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.049
I called them
the night you left.

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.084
How did you find me?

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.319
I don't know.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.987
This is the first
place we looked.

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.289
We're takin' you home
and you're gonna live with us.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.928
Turns out,
Dad's a financial genius.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:01.095
All I did was
take the money you sent home

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:03.632
and embarked on
a periodic investment,

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:05.733
in a no-load mutual fund.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:09.442
He leveraged his ass deep
into soy beans
and cocoa futures.

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:10.773
Right on!

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.413
I picked out
this thermos for you.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.020
I'd kiss you,
but I'm so dirty.

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.923
Dirt doesn't bother me.

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.787
But the smell does.

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.129
Oh, Navin.

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:28.596
[Exclaims]

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.394
Son, you'd better
get in the back
with the dog

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:36.136
until we can get you
hosed down.

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.839
[Shithead barking]

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.249
I love you, Navin.

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:47.784
I love you, too.

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.581
(Taj)
Somebody open a window!

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.992
(Father)
Open all the windows.

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:58.587
(Navin)
I was so glad
to be going home.

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.322
I remembered the days
when I sang and danced

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:03.734
with my family on the porch
of the old house.

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:07.973
But things change,
and with all the additions
to the family,

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:11.199
we had to tear down
the old house,
even though we loved it.
