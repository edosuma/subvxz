WEBVTT

00:03.013 --> 00:05.247
Over 68 million Americans

00:05.281 --> 00:07.883
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:07.917 --> 00:09.384
If danger strikes,

00:09.418 --> 00:11.620
the FBI's international response team

00:11.654 --> 00:15.023
is called into action.

Drop the bass

00:44.820 --> 00:46.588
Whoo!

00:46.622 --> 00:47.956
Dude, there must've been

00:47.990 --> 00:49.824
hundreds of thousands of people there.

00:49.859 --> 00:50.926
That was crazy.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.327
- Man, it was epic.
- Mm-hmm.

00:52.361 --> 00:53.261
The word is epic.

00:53.296 --> 00:55.330
Dude, they host this
festival every year.

00:55.364 --> 00:57.098
The next one is in Buenos Aires.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.000
I'm... I'm in. Like, a
hundred thousand percent.

00:59.035 --> 01:01.836
We got to go every year.

01:01.871 --> 01:04.673
Yo, have you seen the girls here?

01:04.706 --> 01:07.742
They'll never go for us.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.010
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmhmm.

01:09.045 --> 01:10.612
Here.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.914
This'll help loosen you up.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.482
Meow meow. It's like ecstasy.

01:14.517 --> 01:16.451
Oh, no. I don't know.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.287
Dude, that whole party was
rollin'... live a little.

01:19.322 --> 01:21.122
No, but how do you even know
that's what they say it is?

01:21.157 --> 01:23.191
'Cause the guy spoke English.

01:23.225 --> 01:24.960
Will, we're in India.

01:24.994 --> 01:27.629
Cut loose, have some fun.

01:27.663 --> 01:29.497
What do you think?

01:29.532 --> 01:31.032
Her friend's cute.

01:31.067 --> 01:32.500
Come on!

01:32.535 --> 01:34.769
You are such an idiot.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.371
All right.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.643
You only yolo once.

01:41.677 --> 01:44.546
That's what I'm talkin' about. Whoo!

01:44.580 --> 01:47.382
Ow!

02:29.959 --> 02:32.527
Excuse me, how do...

02:41.737 --> 02:43.838
Excuse me, is... is any...

02:47.543 --> 02:48.576
Agh!

02:51.447 --> 02:54.883
I need help!

02:54.917 --> 02:58.453
Someone help me, please.

02:58.487 --> 02:59.888
Help me, please.

03:11.767 --> 03:14.035
Uh, this is backed
by cold, hard science.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.771
India has one of the most
specialized flavor profiles

03:16.806 --> 03:19.741
of any cuisine in the world.

03:19.775 --> 03:21.142
You don't like Indian food?

03:21.177 --> 03:22.711
I don't think it likes me.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.480
Well, it's an acquired taste, like you.

03:25.514 --> 03:28.616
You just don't know where
to eat... I will take you.

03:28.651 --> 03:30.585
Okay. Let's go.

03:30.619 --> 03:32.320
Monty, what've you got?

03:32.354 --> 03:33.722
Namaste.

03:33.756 --> 03:37.459
Americans Will Duncan and Tommy Moses

03:37.493 --> 03:39.260
were having the time
of their lives in Mumbai

03:39.295 --> 03:41.229
until 24 hours ago, when
they fell off the grid.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.665
No cell phone, no credit card charges,

03:43.699 --> 03:46.468
but I found this video on social media.

03:46.502 --> 03:47.402
Early this morning, Will Duncan

03:47.436 --> 03:50.004
was found face down
in an alley in Dharavi.

03:50.039 --> 03:51.673
It's one of the largest slums in India.

03:51.707 --> 03:54.476
He was attacked, and
his kidney was removed.

03:54.510 --> 03:56.778
He's currently in the
hospital fighting for his life.

03:56.812 --> 03:58.580
His friend Tommy Moses is still missing.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.981
Both were college students

04:00.015 --> 04:02.584
in Mumbai for the holy
shake EDM festival.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.186
The bizarre nature of the
attack has the U.S. consulate

04:05.221 --> 04:08.623
terrified at the prospect of
more Americans being targeted.

04:08.657 --> 04:10.458
It says here they
processed thousands of visas

04:10.493 --> 04:12.460
in the last month, all in
connection with the festival.

04:12.495 --> 04:14.829
With Tommy missing and
Will's attackers at large,

04:14.864 --> 04:16.798
they've asked us to investigate

04:16.832 --> 04:18.800
and prepare a threat assessment.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.636
You know, Mumbai is known
for transplant tourism,

04:21.670 --> 04:24.539
where rich foreigners come to
buy organs from India's poor.

04:24.573 --> 04:26.641
Sounds like an urban
legend, but it's not.

04:26.675 --> 04:29.511
It's actually an elaborate
market that involves brokers,

04:29.545 --> 04:32.781
forgers, and human
trafficking of live donors.

04:32.815 --> 04:35.049
Hotch's team was involved in a sting

04:35.084 --> 04:36.851
in New York City in 2009.

04:36.886 --> 04:38.520
I think they arrested an organ broker.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.054
Yeah, he was selling organs

04:40.089 --> 04:41.623
to Americans for upwards of 100 grand.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.658
And we have no question of demand.

04:43.692 --> 04:44.626
In most countries, an organ

04:44.660 --> 04:47.195
can only be donated
between family members

04:47.229 --> 04:49.631
or received via the transplant registry.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.999
Is it possible that Will

04:51.033 --> 04:53.168
voluntarily sold his
kidney to make some cash?

04:53.202 --> 04:54.469
It seems unlikely.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.405
He paid for the festival passes
and the plane tickets himself.

04:57.439 --> 04:59.707
By all accounts, these
were two kids just

04:59.742 --> 05:01.142
looking to have a good time.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.710
Because of the removal of the kidney,

05:02.745 --> 05:04.712
we have to operate under the assumption

05:04.747 --> 05:05.914
that both Will and Tommy

05:05.948 --> 05:09.584
were targeted and drawn into
the black market organ trade.

05:09.618 --> 05:12.720
When we land, I want us
running this from all angles,

05:12.755 --> 05:13.922
how they were taken...

05:13.956 --> 05:15.490
Who performed the surgery...

05:15.524 --> 05:17.258
The organ broker who sold Will's kidney.

05:17.293 --> 05:18.493
Good.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.395
We need to hit the ground running.

05:20.429 --> 05:22.397
Tommy's life depends on it.

Let me not beg for the
stilling of my pain,

R. Tagore.

06:27.984 --> 06:30.519
Okay. Some things to keep in mind...

06:30.553 --> 06:32.554
Politeness is politic.

06:32.588 --> 06:35.123
Never use someone's first
name without their consent,

06:35.158 --> 06:36.792
never refuse hospitality,

06:36.826 --> 06:38.960
and never initiate physical
contact with someone

06:38.995 --> 06:39.928
of the opposite sex.

06:39.962 --> 06:42.130
Even something as
innocuous as a handshake

06:42.165 --> 06:44.032
can be looked upon as a sexual advance.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.300
Hey, I can only control myself,

06:45.334 --> 06:47.302
not how others respond to me.

06:47.336 --> 06:50.272
Mr. Singh, good to see you.

06:50.306 --> 06:52.140
Ah, Deepak, please.

06:52.175 --> 06:55.377
Ahh! Welcome.

06:55.411 --> 06:56.945
- You remember agents Simmons...
- Welcome.

06:56.979 --> 07:00.148
And Jarvis, and, uh, SSA Clara Seger,

07:00.183 --> 07:02.117
who's rejoined us after a short absence.

07:02.151 --> 07:03.485
Wonderful to see you.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.086
Our apologies for pulling you

07:05.121 --> 07:06.988
away from your family's
wedding preparations.

07:07.023 --> 07:08.824
Anything for an old friend.

07:08.858 --> 07:11.159
Now, for convenience's
sake, I have arranged for us

07:11.194 --> 07:13.161
to work with the Mumbai police on site.

07:13.196 --> 07:14.896
They have a security tent

07:14.931 --> 07:16.798
set up near the
entrance to the festival.

07:16.833 --> 07:20.135
So we'll start there, pick up
your honor guard and weapons.

07:20.169 --> 07:22.137
What do you make of the case?

07:22.171 --> 07:25.106
I think we are looking for
some very dangerous men.

07:25.141 --> 07:26.141
These organ traders

07:26.175 --> 07:29.077
have become particularly
brazen in recent years.

07:29.111 --> 07:31.980
They pose as aid workers
and prey on communities

07:32.014 --> 07:35.016
that have been devastated
by natural disasters.

07:35.051 --> 07:36.818
People who've lost everything? Mm.

07:36.853 --> 07:39.187
These brokers promise them
riches to rebuild their lives,

07:39.222 --> 07:40.956
but it never turns out that way.

07:42.859 --> 07:43.992
Shall we?

07:54.203 --> 07:56.771
Don't be afraid to let your
neighbor know you are here.

07:59.742 --> 08:02.510
Remind me again, how did you two meet?

08:02.545 --> 08:04.279
2008, here in Mumbai.

08:04.313 --> 08:06.781
Later, I attended the
FBI national academy

08:06.816 --> 08:07.682
at Jack's invitation.

08:07.717 --> 08:10.518
The courses at Quantico were invaluable.

08:10.553 --> 08:13.154
I got Monty on speaker.
What do you got, Monty?

08:13.189 --> 08:15.056
According to cell phone tower records,

08:15.091 --> 08:18.159
Will and Tommy's last known
location was Shivaji Park.

08:18.194 --> 08:20.328
The site of the festival.
We are headed there now.

08:20.363 --> 08:22.330
Neither cell phone is currently active.

08:22.365 --> 08:23.531
Thanks, Monty.

08:23.566 --> 08:26.201
You know, out of 1,000 possible
victims in the vicinity,

08:26.235 --> 08:28.236
why take two Americans
like Will and Tommy?

08:28.271 --> 08:30.338
Availability and opportunity.

08:30.373 --> 08:33.140
In India, all organs are not equal.

08:33.174 --> 08:34.876
It's a question of blood type.

08:34.910 --> 08:37.511
Most of the Indian
subcontinent is b-positive,

08:37.546 --> 08:41.249
so finding a local match that
is o-negative is more difficult.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.183
Hospital records show
no evidence of abuse

08:43.219 --> 08:44.219
or sexual assault,

08:44.253 --> 08:47.088
though Will had drugs
and alcohol in his system.

08:47.123 --> 08:49.024
Well, let's assume Tommy did, as well.

08:49.058 --> 08:51.526
The drugs could've incapacitated them.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.062
Could've also compromised their organs.

08:54.096 --> 08:55.864
Could imply an urgency or inexperience

08:55.898 --> 08:57.232
on the part of their attackers.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.267
Why take only one organ?

08:59.302 --> 09:01.703
It'd be more profitable to take more.

09:01.737 --> 09:03.104
Yeah, but more to the point,

09:03.139 --> 09:05.273
why even stitch Will
up and dump him at all?

09:05.308 --> 09:06.708
So where's Tommy?

09:19.388 --> 09:21.923
Can I help you, young sir?

09:21.958 --> 09:26.127
You have the most best
beautiful eyes, little lad.

09:26.162 --> 09:28.930
Blue, like gods.

09:28.965 --> 09:30.632
You want to see a rickshaw?

09:30.666 --> 09:31.967
Yeah, sure.

09:32.001 --> 09:34.102
Vroom, vroom. Come.

09:37.306 --> 09:39.107
You want to sit inside? Go.

09:45.181 --> 09:46.648
This is how you start it.

09:46.682 --> 09:47.882
Aiden?

09:47.917 --> 09:49.317
See?

09:49.352 --> 09:52.120
- Right here.
- Aiden!

09:52.154 --> 09:53.555
Aiden!

09:59.362 --> 10:01.830
What the hell are you doing?

10:01.856 --> 10:03.274
_

10:04.266 --> 10:06.234
Come on.

10:15.444 --> 10:18.313
Inspector Shah is one of
our very best officers.

10:18.347 --> 10:20.281
I'm sure you will work well together.

10:20.316 --> 10:23.184
And Constable Irfan is
as sharp as they come.

10:23.219 --> 10:24.853
Mae, head to the hospital.

10:24.887 --> 10:28.289
Talk to Will and his doctors.
Find out what he remembers.

10:28.324 --> 10:30.425
Simmons, talk to the
festival organizers.

10:30.459 --> 10:33.428
This site was Will and
Tommy's last known location.

10:33.462 --> 10:35.130
See what you can learn about the moments

10:35.164 --> 10:36.431
leading up to their abduction.

10:36.465 --> 10:37.599
You got it.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.467
Monty, you with us?

10:39.502 --> 10:41.002
Always.

10:41.037 --> 10:43.304
Any updates on prior attacks or crimes

10:43.339 --> 10:45.273
in the region that fit
this level of brutality?

10:45.307 --> 10:46.808
Uh, still working on it,

10:46.842 --> 10:48.676
but I have been searching hashtags,

10:48.711 --> 10:51.479
blog posts, and news feeds
surrounding the festival.

10:51.514 --> 10:53.314
It's day 3 of 4.

10:53.349 --> 10:55.116
If anyone's seen anything out
of the ordinary and tweeted

10:55.151 --> 10:56.518
about it, I'll find it.

10:56.552 --> 10:57.852
Great.

10:57.887 --> 11:00.055
Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and I

11:00.089 --> 11:02.190
to the neighborhood
where Will was found.

11:02.224 --> 11:04.225
Yes. They call it Kidneyville.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.627
Kidneyville?

11:05.661 --> 11:07.228
Yes, that's the name
the locals have given it.

11:07.263 --> 11:10.799
But I must warn you, it's not safe.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.467
If you could spare a few more men,

11:12.501 --> 11:13.968
I'd like to canvass

11:14.003 --> 11:16.304
and interview possible witnesses.

11:16.338 --> 11:18.273
Okay.

11:22.078 --> 11:24.679
That was a 6-hour flight
on a moment's notice.

11:24.713 --> 11:26.381
I told him India was a mistake.

11:26.415 --> 11:28.249
Okay. What happened? On the phone,

11:28.284 --> 11:31.319
they would only tell us
that Will was in trouble.

11:31.353 --> 11:33.822
There was an incident.

11:33.856 --> 11:36.224
Will is in surgery now.

11:36.258 --> 11:39.260
He was attacked in Mumbai.
He's in serious condition.

11:39.295 --> 11:41.229
Oh, no.

11:41.263 --> 11:44.933
Oh...

11:44.967 --> 11:46.334
- Oh, my...
- Janice, oh, my god.

11:47.403 --> 11:49.337
I want you to know that
our team is there now,

11:49.371 --> 11:51.206
and they are going to
do everything they can

11:51.240 --> 11:53.508
to get the boys home.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.877
I need to ask you a few
questions about Will and Tommy.

11:55.911 --> 11:58.580
Would that be all right?

11:58.614 --> 12:01.416
I'm the festival organizer,
and I'm telling you,

12:01.450 --> 12:03.751
this is a party, not a police state.

12:03.786 --> 12:05.954
We're not here to surveil
the attendees' every move.

12:05.988 --> 12:08.056
But the bar-coded security
braces, they are able

12:08.090 --> 12:10.258
to track all movement in
and out of the festival?

12:10.292 --> 12:11.004
Yes, yes.

12:12.755 --> 12:15.056
So we need you to provide
us with any information

12:15.091 --> 12:17.025
you can regarding Will
and Tommy's movement.

12:17.059 --> 12:18.226
When was the last time their bracelets

12:18.261 --> 12:19.861
were scanned for entry and exit,

12:19.896 --> 12:22.297
are they still active,
that kind of a thing.

12:22.331 --> 12:24.432
I'll see what I can do.

12:30.406 --> 12:33.241
You know, this park is
the largest in Mumbai.

12:33.276 --> 12:35.977
It's a cradle of Indian cricket.

12:36.012 --> 12:38.146
Now, it's just being trampled on.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.315
All the greats have trained right here.

12:40.349 --> 12:42.918
Like Sachin Tendulkar?

12:42.952 --> 12:45.153
You know cricket, sir?

12:52.461 --> 12:53.929
Here in Kidneyville,

12:53.963 --> 12:56.431
entire families are coerced
into selling their kidneys.

12:56.465 --> 12:58.199
Most suffer from complications

12:58.234 --> 12:59.768
that render them unable to work

12:59.802 --> 13:01.937
and in more debt than before.

13:01.971 --> 13:03.338
How much does one go for?

13:03.372 --> 13:05.106
Maybe $6,000 U.S.

13:05.141 --> 13:08.109
That could feed an
entire family for years.

13:08.144 --> 13:09.711
If they get the money.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.047
Most only ever receive a portion.

13:12.081 --> 13:13.315
This place is like a maze.

13:13.349 --> 13:15.850
There's no clear path in or out,
very little room for a vehicle,

13:15.885 --> 13:17.218
much less foot traffic.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.287
Will's attackers would've
had to move quickly

13:19.322 --> 13:20.956
to avoid being caught.

13:20.990 --> 13:24.392
Which means Will and possibly
Tommy were being held here.

13:24.427 --> 13:26.094
Our unsub is a local.

13:26.128 --> 13:28.697
Well, with 1 million
people per one square mile,

13:28.731 --> 13:31.299
it'd be like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

13:31.334 --> 13:33.563
Hey, hey!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.318
_

13:36.739 --> 13:39.207
Modern India loves to
pretend this doesn't exist,

13:39.241 --> 13:41.343
but this is our surviving legacy.

13:41.343 --> 13:43.444
The poorest of the poor, the
Dalits, as they are known,

13:43.478 --> 13:46.280
still face ostracism and
violence almost daily.

13:46.315 --> 13:50.451
Many in India see them as
something less than human.

13:50.485 --> 13:52.086
Change is not easy.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.622
It takes good leadership.

13:57.693 --> 14:00.261
The longer we stay here, the
more attention we will draw.

14:00.295 --> 14:01.996
Things could go badly.

14:10.672 --> 14:12.039
Having given the volume
of people and the fact

14:12.074 --> 14:14.141
there are multiple full
entry and exit gates,

14:14.176 --> 14:16.010
this is the perfect hunting ground.

14:16.044 --> 14:17.612
According to our records, Will and Tommy

14:17.646 --> 14:20.681
left the festival at 2:17
A.M. the previous night,

14:20.716 --> 14:22.516
and both bracelets were scanned
within seconds of each other.

14:22.551 --> 14:24.118
Well, if they left
together, it could mean

14:24.152 --> 14:25.519
they were abducted at the same.

14:29.258 --> 14:31.058
Tommy's bracelet was
just scanned for entry

14:31.093 --> 14:33.027
into the VIP lounge.

14:33.061 --> 14:35.529
Whoever has the badge could be our guy.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.498
- Your men armed?
- Yeah.

14:37.532 --> 14:40.067
Let's go.

14:44.172 --> 14:45.373
Yeah?

14:47.409 --> 14:49.076
Okay.

14:49.111 --> 14:52.213
We'll be right up.

14:52.247 --> 14:53.514
Will's dead.

14:55.217 --> 14:58.352
They want us to come claim the body.

15:15.137 --> 15:17.138
The guy in the hoodie.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.708
Police.

15:26.248 --> 15:28.082
Tommy?

15:32.554 --> 15:34.121
Surgeons often have signatures,

15:34.156 --> 15:36.958
how they cut, ligate, suture, etc...

15:36.992 --> 15:39.460
So it might be possible
to tell who performed

15:39.494 --> 15:41.195
Will's surgery by looking...

15:46.935 --> 15:50.271
These cuts are crude, ragged, unskilled.

15:50.305 --> 15:53.774
There's no way that they were
done by a medical professional.

15:53.809 --> 15:55.977
Based on how poorly excised the side is,

15:56.011 --> 15:58.612
I would doubt that the organ
is even viable for transplant.

15:58.647 --> 16:00.982
I mean, it's a $1.2 billion industry.

16:01.016 --> 16:02.883
No doctor is ever gonna be this sloppy.

16:02.918 --> 16:06.654
Yes, but most people would
not know where to even begin.

16:06.688 --> 16:09.256
Oh, looks like a needle prick,
perhaps an injection site.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.758
He could be drugging them.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.593
If this attempt is so badly
botched, it pretty much

16:12.627 --> 16:16.197
guarantees that the attacker's
gonna find another victim.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.301
All right. Thanks, Simmons.

16:24.006 --> 16:24.839
What's that?

16:24.873 --> 16:27.975
It's a flier looking for kidney donors.

16:28.010 --> 16:31.645
The symbols for the different
blood types caught my eye.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.281
They don't even try to
hide the exploitation.

16:34.316 --> 16:35.816
You know, I've been all over the world,

16:35.851 --> 16:37.151
and places like this, they just...

16:37.185 --> 16:40.254
Never gets easier.

16:40.288 --> 16:42.189
So what's the latest?

16:42.224 --> 16:43.824
Good news and bad news.

16:43.859 --> 16:45.192
Tommy's alive.

16:45.227 --> 16:47.094
Simmons found him at the festival.

16:47.129 --> 16:49.330
Turns out that he and Will
went their separate ways

16:49.364 --> 16:51.265
after leaving the party that night.

16:51.299 --> 16:53.300
Let me guess, he met a girl.

16:53.335 --> 16:55.269
Earlier in the day, his
cell phone and wallet

16:55.303 --> 16:56.937
were stolen by a pickpocket.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.440
So Tommy spent the
last 24 hours partying

16:59.474 --> 17:01.842
and had no idea if Will
was in trouble or missing?

17:01.877 --> 17:04.345
Which brings me to the bad news.

17:04.378 --> 17:06.347
Will's dead.

17:06.381 --> 17:08.348
His heart failed during surgery.

17:08.383 --> 17:10.317
Mae doesn't think we're
looking for a doctor.

17:10.352 --> 17:12.286
Someone with medical knowledge,

17:12.319 --> 17:13.220
but not a professional.

17:13.255 --> 17:15.388
Maybe someone looking
to get into the trade.

17:15.424 --> 17:18.992
We've got to find that organ broker.

17:24.532 --> 17:28.335
Deepak, who's the guy
watching us from the car?

17:28.369 --> 17:31.205
The mafia, just like the godfather.

17:31.239 --> 17:32.840
They practically run the slums.

17:32.874 --> 17:35.342
They tolerate law
enforcement, but only just.

17:35.377 --> 17:37.711
They're the ones that most
likely put up the fliers.

17:37.746 --> 17:41.215
If we're gonna find this
broker, we have to do it soon.

17:41.249 --> 17:43.117
What are you thinking?

17:46.521 --> 17:49.323
Jack, what are you doing?

17:51.259 --> 17:53.227
Jack, this is very unsafe.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.436
I want to talk to your boss.

18:02.471 --> 18:03.804
Jack, I cannot allow this.

18:19.287 --> 18:21.422
I'm unarmed.

18:21.456 --> 18:23.090
The last thing you want me to do

18:23.125 --> 18:25.726
is bring the full force of
the U.S. government down here.

18:29.397 --> 18:30.464
Just you.

18:30.499 --> 18:31.899
Jack, listen...

18:31.933 --> 18:34.435
Just me. I'm fine.

18:36.438 --> 18:37.905
I'll see you back at the tent.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.583
Get in.

19:08.846 --> 19:12.048
You asked to speak with me?

19:12.082 --> 19:14.250
No, I asked to speak with the boss.

19:16.737 --> 19:20.439
_

19:24.428 --> 19:26.029
Not who you imagined?

19:32.436 --> 19:36.472
I've seen you and your woman
walking the streets of Dharavi.

19:36.507 --> 19:40.209
What is it you hope to find?

19:40.244 --> 19:41.411
Justice.

19:41.445 --> 19:45.048
A young American man is dead,
abducted from your streets,

19:45.082 --> 19:48.051
pulled into the black
market organ trade.

19:48.085 --> 19:49.919
I want to know who's responsible.

19:49.954 --> 19:52.322
I am a businesswoman.

19:52.356 --> 19:54.223
Street crime is not my concern.

19:54.258 --> 19:56.592
The boy's kidney was harvested.

19:56.627 --> 19:58.828
I think you know who's responsible.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.263
I think there's very little

20:00.297 --> 20:02.031
that happens here that you don't know.

20:02.066 --> 20:05.001
Nothing happens in Dharavi
without my knowledge.

20:05.035 --> 20:06.035
Then you've got a problem.

20:06.070 --> 20:09.272
One of your men is
striking out on their own,

20:09.306 --> 20:10.406
only their carelessness

20:10.441 --> 20:13.943
and lack of skill has
already left one person dead.

20:13.978 --> 20:15.778
Mm.

20:15.813 --> 20:18.281
I would never do business
with someone so sloppy.

20:18.315 --> 20:21.250
- No?
- No.

20:21.285 --> 20:24.187
My greatest commodity is my people.

20:24.221 --> 20:28.958
So the services you provide,
the transplants you negotiate,

20:28.993 --> 20:30.860
they're all done by professionals?

20:30.894 --> 20:32.261
Mm.

20:32.296 --> 20:35.098
The buyers are arranged
months in advance.

20:35.132 --> 20:36.265
Not only would such a man

20:36.300 --> 20:40.236
not be able to sell a kidney
stolen in such a hasty manner,

20:40.270 --> 20:42.105
but he'd face my wrath.

20:42.139 --> 20:45.375
And people here are
not afraid of the law.

20:45.409 --> 20:48.778
They are afraid of me.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.949
So it sounds like we
both want this guy caught.

20:52.983 --> 20:54.817
I am sorry.

20:54.852 --> 20:57.186
I do not have anything more to offer.

20:59.356 --> 21:01.157
It's not just bad business

21:01.191 --> 21:04.394
that you need to be worried about.

21:04.428 --> 21:07.263
If I have to come back here,

21:07.297 --> 21:11.601
if another American
dies, I won't be alone.

21:11.635 --> 21:15.438
Ah.

21:15.472 --> 21:19.475
And here I thought the enemy
of my enemy was my friend.

21:50.574 --> 21:53.643
Could you take a photo of me?

21:53.677 --> 21:56.312
S-sure.

22:02.519 --> 22:05.321
Come closer, closer.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.095
Come see. There's too much light.

22:16.266 --> 22:17.500
What the hell?

22:39.256 --> 22:41.958
What are you doing?

22:46.630 --> 22:48.498
You want money?

22:48.532 --> 22:49.932
My family is rich.

22:49.967 --> 22:53.336
We have more money than
you could ever dream of.

22:57.407 --> 23:01.244
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no! No, no, no, no!

23:01.278 --> 23:04.247
Please!

23:04.281 --> 23:06.849
There's no way that Hasina's involved.

23:06.884 --> 23:09.085
She wouldn't risk tainting
her own supply lines.

23:09.119 --> 23:10.253
All right. So we're lookin' for someone

23:10.287 --> 23:11.621
who's workin' on the fringes,

23:11.655 --> 23:13.222
doing so with great risk to themselves.

23:13.257 --> 23:14.857
Speaks to their desperation.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.026
So if we're not looking
to organized crime,

23:17.060 --> 23:20.029
and we've ruled out a
corrupt doctor or surgeon...

23:20.063 --> 23:22.064
Then we're looking for an individual.

23:22.099 --> 23:24.534
Jack, there's another victim.

23:28.172 --> 23:30.773
The EMT said he's heavily
sedated but stable,

23:30.807 --> 23:33.643
so they should be good to move
him as soon as the road clears.

23:33.677 --> 23:35.444
- He was at the festival.
- Yeah.

23:35.479 --> 23:37.413
Both of his eyes were removed,

23:37.447 --> 23:40.082
and there are signs that
his wrists were restrained.

23:42.419 --> 23:44.453
Well, he didn't take the kidney.

23:47.357 --> 23:49.992
Look here.

23:50.027 --> 23:51.928
- That's a puncture mark.
- Yeah.

23:51.962 --> 23:53.729
That's the same as Will.

23:53.764 --> 23:55.498
I think it's an injection site.

23:55.532 --> 23:57.433
Ah, if he's using drugs to subdue them,

23:57.467 --> 23:59.335
that mean's he's able to lure
them into his playing field

23:59.369 --> 24:00.937
with some kind of a ruse.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.308
Hmm.

24:10.547 --> 24:12.682
Well, whatever he used to
remove them was crude and blunt.

24:12.716 --> 24:16.419
There's significant damage
to the ocular cavities.

24:16.453 --> 24:17.887
Yeah. This is an ugly escalation.

24:17.921 --> 24:20.590
I mean, his eyes have been removed
even more crudely than Will's kidney.

24:20.624 --> 24:22.358
Yeah. And also, there is no such thing

24:22.392 --> 24:23.826
as a whole-eye transplant.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.027
Just the cornea.

24:25.062 --> 24:26.529
Yeah. And given that the unsub

24:26.563 --> 24:28.764
didn't even attempt
to take Zak's kidney,

24:28.799 --> 24:30.533
I mean, maybe he's trying
to make a statement.

24:30.567 --> 24:33.803
Something about the influx
of foreigners at the festival?

24:33.837 --> 24:35.338
Oh, maybe. But what worries me

24:35.372 --> 24:37.974
is the timetable, a lack
of a cooling-off period

24:38.008 --> 24:39.675
and the fact that the
festival is in full swing

24:39.710 --> 24:41.644
for another night.

24:41.678 --> 24:44.180
It all but guarantees
he will strike again.

24:44.214 --> 24:46.515
We are looking for a man
from Dharavi between the ages

24:46.550 --> 24:49.952
of 25 to 45 whom we'd
most likely consider to be

24:49.987 --> 24:51.654
a power reassurance offender.

24:51.688 --> 24:54.056
Which means his intention
is to harm but not kill.

24:54.091 --> 24:56.125
This man will have low self-esteem

24:56.159 --> 24:57.627
and a low social standing.

24:57.661 --> 24:59.996
We think that the unsub
wants his victims to live.

25:00.030 --> 25:02.031
He took the time to
suture Will's incision

25:02.065 --> 25:03.566
and to bandage Zak's eyes,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.868
and these are acts of remorse and guilt.

25:05.902 --> 25:09.805
He dumped both victims in
locations where they would be

25:09.840 --> 25:12.842
found so that the damage he
inflicted might be rectified.

25:12.876 --> 25:15.011
However, the brutality on
display in his latest attack

25:15.045 --> 25:16.579
points toward a looming
devolution that will only

25:16.613 --> 25:17.913
make him more dangerous.

25:17.948 --> 25:19.882
And he is fixated on the festival.

25:19.916 --> 25:21.550
Yes. It provides anonymity.

25:21.585 --> 25:23.386
As a local, he can move to and from

25:23.420 --> 25:24.420
without drawing attention.

25:24.454 --> 25:27.490
And the festival may be
the source of his rage.

25:27.524 --> 25:28.691
Based on the organs he took,

25:28.725 --> 25:30.726
we believe the unsub may be
trying to make a statement.

25:30.761 --> 25:32.261
And based on the function

25:32.296 --> 25:34.530
of the kidneys and the eyes in the body,

25:34.564 --> 25:36.532
perhaps he's lashing out at the toxicity

25:36.566 --> 25:39.502
and blindness of the tourists
here at the EDM festival.

25:41.038 --> 25:42.905
Our unsub is familiar with the area

25:42.939 --> 25:45.508
and confident to dump his
bodies right in the open.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.576
Our local P.D. should review
all complaints or threats

25:47.611 --> 25:49.412
they've received leading
up to the festival.

25:49.446 --> 25:52.281
It's crucial that we keep
up the canvassing of Dharavi.

25:52.316 --> 25:53.549
Lean on any sources you have.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.117
Our unsub has medical knowledge

25:55.152 --> 25:57.586
and access to medical
equipment like the syringe

25:57.621 --> 25:59.689
and the drugs that he
uses to subdue his victims,

25:59.723 --> 26:01.457
so let's look at males
in the medical field

26:01.491 --> 26:03.059
who have a criminal record.

26:03.093 --> 26:05.528
We need to narrow in
on his abduction ruse.

26:05.562 --> 26:07.063
He's not done killing,

26:07.097 --> 26:09.231
and we have to find a way to stop him.

26:26.812 --> 26:28.880
Why is it so hot here?

26:28.914 --> 26:30.615
All this walking is killing my feet.

26:30.627 --> 26:33.229
And seriously, can a
girl get a cheeseburger?

26:33.263 --> 26:35.798
Like, a turkey burger?

26:35.833 --> 26:39.035
Oh, I got it.

26:39.069 --> 26:41.537
I'm complaining,

26:41.572 --> 26:43.372
and you're literally helping old ladies.

26:43.407 --> 26:45.541
Look, I'll go get us a taxi.

26:45.576 --> 26:48.411
No more walking.

26:48.445 --> 26:49.712
Thank you.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.314
I don't know why you put up with me.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.584
I'll be right back.

27:09.032 --> 27:10.900
Need taxi? Sir, right here.

27:10.934 --> 27:12.768
- Yeah.
- Going to holy shake, huh?

27:12.803 --> 27:13.936
- Mm-hmm. 
- Let me take you.

27:13.971 --> 27:15.037
Thanks.

27:27.818 --> 27:30.586
Oh, hey.

27:30.621 --> 27:31.988
Hey, Monty. What's up?

27:32.022 --> 27:33.823
I just got a hit on social media.

27:33.857 --> 27:36.325
A girl named Irene from Abilene, Texas,

27:36.360 --> 27:38.594
tweeted an hour ago that
her boyfriend went missing.

27:38.629 --> 27:40.463
What do you think? Too
early to sound the alarm?

27:40.497 --> 27:42.965
No, I don't think we can
dismiss anything at this point.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.534
I'll contact her and send you the info.

27:44.568 --> 27:45.735
Okay, great.

27:48.005 --> 27:50.139
So you were in Mumbai for the festival

27:50.174 --> 27:52.108
and then planned on traveling
around India for a month?

27:52.142 --> 27:54.977
Yeah. Travis is a volunteer.

27:55.012 --> 27:57.647
He helps provide free medical care.

27:57.681 --> 28:02.718
His shift was about to start,
so he went to get us a taxi

28:02.753 --> 28:04.854
because my feet hurt.

28:04.888 --> 28:08.991
He texted me to meet him at the...

28:09.026 --> 28:11.894
What do you call those weird
little cars with three wheels?

28:11.929 --> 28:13.396
An auto rickshaw.

28:13.430 --> 28:16.799
But when I went over there, he was gone.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.868
Did you actually see
him get inside a vehicle.

28:18.902 --> 28:21.304
No. But he would never just leave.

28:21.338 --> 28:23.005
It's totally out of character.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.308
I'm a mess.

28:25.342 --> 28:27.143
He always takes care of me.

28:31.915 --> 28:35.017
The place was packed with
festival-goers and tourists.

28:35.052 --> 28:37.186
It's about halfway between the
slums and the festival itself.

28:37.221 --> 28:40.056
There was hostels, shops, bars.

28:40.090 --> 28:41.591
And what do you want to
bet that Zak was registered

28:41.625 --> 28:42.658
at a hostel nearby?

28:42.693 --> 28:44.927
And he's using an auto
rickshaw to abduct them.

28:44.962 --> 28:46.896
Well, taking into account the festival,

28:46.930 --> 28:49.031
the point of abduction
outside the hostel,

28:49.066 --> 28:52.101
and the two dump sites,
our unsub's comfort zone

28:52.135 --> 28:53.769
stretches less than
a half a square mile.

28:53.804 --> 28:56.539
It's not marked, but there's
a hospital right here.

28:56.573 --> 28:57.573
Maahir Care.

28:57.608 --> 28:59.942
I could get my men to
pull the personnel records,

28:59.977 --> 29:02.712
but, uh, in Mumbai, so
much is still done by hand.

29:02.746 --> 29:05.047
It would be faster to send someone.

29:05.082 --> 29:06.682
We're on it.

29:06.717 --> 29:09.385
Mae, go through the department's
motor vehicle records.

29:09.419 --> 29:11.587
The auto rickshaw is
central to his ruse.

29:11.622 --> 29:12.955
Let's see if we can
find him through that.

29:12.990 --> 29:14.290
Okay. Monty, can you help us

29:14.324 --> 29:16.392
by pulling some plates
from the traffic cameras?

29:16.426 --> 29:17.593
Sure can.

29:17.628 --> 29:19.929
And we need to focus our
search in the southernmost zone,

29:19.963 --> 29:21.097
keep up the canvassing.

29:21.131 --> 29:24.133
There are over 60,000
interlocking structures.

29:24.167 --> 29:25.768
Something's bothering me.

29:25.802 --> 29:28.638
Why isn't the unsub dumping
the bodies near the festival?

29:28.672 --> 29:30.039
It seems like a contradiction.

29:30.073 --> 29:32.308
I-if it's about making a
statement, who's it for?

29:34.409 --> 29:35.644
_

29:35.966 --> 29:38.735
_

29:41.694 --> 29:44.834
_

29:46.527 --> 29:49.282
_

29:50.668 --> 29:51.605
_

29:54.790 --> 29:55.790
_

29:58.669 --> 30:01.270
So you're saying, why leave
the victims in Kidneyville?

30:01.305 --> 30:03.739
I'm saying, why not just kill them?

30:03.774 --> 30:05.241
Why take the organs at all?

30:05.275 --> 30:07.076
Mm, maybe it's about the body
parts and not the victims.

30:07.110 --> 30:08.144
Maybe he's building

30:08.178 --> 30:10.613
his own twisted version
of Frankenstein's monster.

30:10.647 --> 30:15.184
What if this isn't
about making a statement?

30:15.218 --> 30:16.986
The damage done to Zak was aggressive,

30:17.020 --> 30:18.487
up close and personal.

30:18.522 --> 30:19.822
If I didn't know any better,

30:19.856 --> 30:21.324
I would've thought he knew his victims.

30:21.358 --> 30:22.825
Yeah. Making the choice

30:22.859 --> 30:25.127
to cut someone up like
this is so intimate,

30:25.162 --> 30:26.095
so specific.

30:26.129 --> 30:28.597
This could be personal
in a different way.

30:28.632 --> 30:30.633
He could be trying to shine a spotlight

30:30.667 --> 30:33.002
on some personal loss he's suffered.

30:33.036 --> 30:35.104
Maybe it's about revenge,
an eye for an eye.

30:35.138 --> 30:37.039
Literally. Kidney and
corneal transplants

30:37.074 --> 30:39.375
are two of the top organs
transplanted worldwide,

30:39.409 --> 30:42.511
so even if they're not being
taken for transplant purposes,

30:42.546 --> 30:44.947
maybe there is something
to the organ trade

30:44.981 --> 30:46.349
being at the center of all this.

30:46.383 --> 30:48.384
You know I don't
believe in coincidences.

30:48.418 --> 30:49.251
Well, some Hindus

30:49.286 --> 30:51.187
reject the concept of organ donation

30:51.221 --> 30:53.522
because they don't believe
a body should move on

30:53.557 --> 30:55.624
to the next life incomplete.

30:55.659 --> 30:59.328
Maybe the unsub is rushing to
complete or make someone whole

30:59.363 --> 31:01.030
before he cremates them.

31:01.064 --> 31:04.033
It's the responsibility
of the eldest son.

31:04.067 --> 31:06.369
The hospital releases
the body to the families

31:06.403 --> 31:09.205
so that they can wash and
prepare the body for cremation.

31:09.239 --> 31:10.906
That's it.

31:10.941 --> 31:12.908
We thought the festival was the trigger.

31:12.943 --> 31:15.878
It wasn't. It was an opportunity.

31:15.912 --> 31:17.546
Based on his victim selection,

31:17.581 --> 31:20.149
we're looking for someone
who's lost a male figure.

31:20.183 --> 31:22.184
Potentially a brother or a father.

31:22.219 --> 31:24.253
Monty, can you access hospital records

31:24.287 --> 31:28.157
for recent transplants
or deaths involving locals

31:28.191 --> 31:29.825
within the unsub's comfort zone?

31:29.860 --> 31:31.127
Uh, how recent?

31:31.161 --> 31:34.263
Traditionally, Hindu funeral
rites take place within 48 hours.

31:34.297 --> 31:35.030
It's already been 2 days.

31:35.065 --> 31:36.866
He's running out of time. Monty?

31:36.900 --> 31:39.068
I'm working my magic here,
but I'm coming up empty.

31:39.102 --> 31:41.036
These records simply aren't online.

31:41.071 --> 31:42.705
So why wouldn't he take

31:42.739 --> 31:44.440
all the organs from the first victim?

31:44.474 --> 31:46.075
Well, if it's a question of karma,

31:46.109 --> 31:47.943
perhaps he's
cherry-picking the victims,

31:47.978 --> 31:50.179
hoping to give them a better
chance in the next life.

31:50.213 --> 31:52.948
Will wore glasses. He had poor eyesight.

31:52.983 --> 31:55.217
Zak had blue eyes, fair skin.

31:55.252 --> 31:57.119
In India, this is most desirable,

31:57.154 --> 31:59.221
a lineage of colonialism.

31:59.256 --> 32:01.223
It's an indication of status.

32:01.258 --> 32:03.192
The unsub would want
the healthiest kidneys,

32:03.226 --> 32:04.326
the best eyes.

32:04.361 --> 32:06.929
So in his mind, when this
loved one is reincarnated,

32:06.963 --> 32:08.731
he will come back in a higher caste.

32:08.765 --> 32:10.232
I'm sorry, Jack,

32:10.267 --> 32:12.101
but I cannot access these patient files.

32:12.135 --> 32:14.770
But I can tell you,
via pharmacy records,

32:14.805 --> 32:17.106
that immunosuppressants were prescribed.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.208
The transplants took
place at Maahir Care,

32:19.242 --> 32:21.277
the hospital within the
unsub's comfort zone,

32:21.311 --> 32:23.612
but I cannot tell you
who the donors were.

32:23.647 --> 32:26.882
There's only one person
who can get us that answer.

32:26.917 --> 32:28.217
Turns out that there are

32:28.251 --> 32:31.153
over 300,000 auto
rickshaws in this city.

32:31.188 --> 32:34.223
Monty helped us pull some
plates from a traffic camera

32:34.257 --> 32:36.459
in the area to help narrow the search.

32:36.493 --> 32:39.228
Now, most drivers can't
afford to purchase a vehicle.

32:39.262 --> 32:40.463
They rent them at a day rate.

32:40.497 --> 32:42.331
So we reached out to the rental agencies

32:42.365 --> 32:44.266
to see if we could find a match,

32:44.301 --> 32:47.603
and we got a hit... um,
a driver, Mahal Sabah.

32:47.637 --> 32:49.171
He missed his payment the last 2 days,

32:49.206 --> 32:50.840
and he hasn't returned the vehicle.

32:50.874 --> 32:52.408
The owner said, until 2 days ago,

32:52.442 --> 32:54.243
he had not missed a payment in 20 years.

32:54.277 --> 32:55.411
I mean, what are the odds?

32:55.445 --> 32:56.745
Do you have an address?

32:56.780 --> 32:58.514
Inspector Shah and I
are looking for it now.

32:58.548 --> 33:00.316
The rental agencies didn't have it,

33:00.350 --> 33:02.651
and most of the P.D.'s
files are not online,

33:02.686 --> 33:04.820
so we are searching for it manually.

33:04.855 --> 33:07.323
So I know the rickshaw
is part of his ruse,

33:07.357 --> 33:09.358
but what if this guy's an EMT?

33:09.392 --> 33:12.361
Ambulance drivers here are
employed by private firms,

33:12.395 --> 33:13.863
and they have regular
access to the hospital

33:13.897 --> 33:15.698
and the festival site, or vice versa.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.766
That would explain the
access to medical equipment.

33:17.801 --> 33:19.335
Follow up on the private firm

33:19.369 --> 33:21.136
and run down their personal records.

33:21.171 --> 33:22.404
You got it.

33:25.575 --> 33:27.643
I did not expect to see you again,

33:27.677 --> 33:31.847
certainly not without
your big American cavalry.

33:31.882 --> 33:33.482
I thought about what you said.

33:33.517 --> 33:35.384
Perhaps we can work together.

33:35.418 --> 33:38.687
After all, my unfinished
business is also yours.

33:38.722 --> 33:41.457
You told me nothing happens

33:41.491 --> 33:43.125
in this slum without your knowledge,

33:43.159 --> 33:45.027
and that people are
your greatest commodity.

33:45.061 --> 33:47.396
You work with what you
have, and so do they.

33:47.430 --> 33:49.164
I give them a chance at a future.

33:49.199 --> 33:52.201
And that's why you
handle things yourself.

33:52.235 --> 33:53.502
You're protective of them.

33:56.606 --> 34:00.209
Two days ago, you brokered
a transplant at Maahir Care,

34:00.243 --> 34:02.211
two corneas and a kidney.

34:02.245 --> 34:04.413
Where did the organs come from?

34:04.447 --> 34:05.848
Where?

34:05.882 --> 34:08.117
From no one, a Dalit.

34:09.286 --> 34:12.321
Well, that man is the one
who is making a fool of you.

34:12.355 --> 34:14.255
Someone in his family

34:14.291 --> 34:16.824
is responsible for the death
of an innocent American.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.393
I want a name

34:18.428 --> 34:22.364
so that my team can stop
him before he kills again.

34:30.407 --> 34:31.674
Oh!

35:00.234 --> 35:02.369
Two days ago, Hasina brokered a series

35:02.403 --> 35:05.472
of last-minute transplants
a kidney, two corneas...

35:05.506 --> 35:06.873
And a heart.

35:06.908 --> 35:08.408
Yes. How'd you know?

35:08.442 --> 35:10.877
Travis is a volunteer, he
takes care of his girlfriend.

35:10.912 --> 35:12.579
He's kind, has a good soul.

35:12.613 --> 35:15.415
The organs came from the
same man, Mahal Sabah.

35:15.449 --> 35:16.850
That's the missing rickshaw driver.

35:16.884 --> 35:19.152
He was brought into the
hospital for dehydration

35:19.186 --> 35:21.254
and pronounced dead a short time later.

35:21.289 --> 35:22.923
There have been reports of this.

35:22.957 --> 35:25.258
A Dalit goes into a hospital
with a curable illness

35:25.293 --> 35:26.593
but ends up dead.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.395
The doctors take
advantage of the situation

35:28.429 --> 35:30.897
and sell the organs
to the highest bidder.

35:30.932 --> 35:32.399
Taking advantage is too kind.

35:32.433 --> 35:34.267
Mahal's son is an ambulance driver,

35:34.302 --> 35:36.536
and he's the one who brought him in.

35:36.571 --> 35:39.439
Samraj Sabah. That's our guy.

35:39.473 --> 35:40.740
He must've been using
his father's vehicle

35:40.775 --> 35:42.375
for the abductions.

35:42.410 --> 35:46.046
Okay, I've got him. No
address, just a postal code,

35:46.080 --> 35:49.182
400017.

35:49.216 --> 35:50.884
That's Dharavi.

35:50.918 --> 35:52.852
There are no formal street
addresses in Dharavi,

35:52.887 --> 35:53.954
but the slums

35:53.988 --> 35:56.957
have organized an informal
community mail service.

35:56.991 --> 35:58.992
They've been mapping the area
for the past couple years.

35:59.076 --> 36:00.868
_

36:00.995 --> 36:02.362
We've worked out a deal

36:02.396 --> 36:05.031
so that they share their records
in exchange for police protection.

36:05.066 --> 36:06.566
All right. Monty, we're gonna need

36:06.601 --> 36:07.901
the most recent satellite imagery.

36:07.935 --> 36:09.903
If we can compare that
with these local maps,

36:09.937 --> 36:11.972
it should give us a pretty good
idea of what we're walking into.

36:12.006 --> 36:14.140
We need to go in strategically.

36:14.175 --> 36:16.876
Travis' safety is our
number-one concern.

36:51.178 --> 36:53.980
Gasoline. Everyone get back.

36:54.015 --> 36:55.148
Don't move!

36:58.285 --> 36:59.853
If he takes that shot,
it could ignite that room.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.688
We need to get fire
trucks here immediately.

37:01.722 --> 37:03.323
There's a unit in Dharavi.

37:03.357 --> 37:05.025
This whole block will go up.

37:05.059 --> 37:06.926
I just wanted to give him better life.

37:06.961 --> 37:07.994
He has suffered enough.

37:08.029 --> 37:09.262
You don't want to do this.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.034
This doesn't have to be the end.

37:14.068 --> 37:16.803
I could not let him
go without good heart.

37:16.837 --> 37:18.505
- He deserves that.
- He does.

37:18.539 --> 37:21.808
He deserved kindness,

37:21.842 --> 37:24.110
but so does he.

37:24.145 --> 37:28.314
They treated my father
like he was nothing,

37:28.349 --> 37:32.619
worth more dead than alive.

37:32.653 --> 37:35.689
They cut him up like
he was not even man,

37:35.723 --> 37:39.359
just spare parts,

37:39.393 --> 37:42.295
spare parts for the rich.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.834
In death,

37:47.868 --> 37:49.836
he shall live again.

38:08.789 --> 38:11.825
Travis, you'll be okay.

38:11.859 --> 38:13.960
Jack.

38:57.772 --> 38:59.372
It's a most important test match.

38:59.406 --> 39:00.774
All right. I'll watch it.

39:00.808 --> 39:02.142
You better.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.544
Later.

39:04.578 --> 39:05.645
It was a pleasure.

39:05.679 --> 39:07.046
It was indeed. Take care.

39:09.183 --> 39:12.118
Jack, you must come as my special guest.

39:12.153 --> 39:14.454
Indian wedding is a
most auspicious occasion.

39:14.488 --> 39:15.989
I'm sure the team won't mind the delay.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.757
There's going to be food and dancing.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.760
I'd love to, but, uh, next time.

39:20.795 --> 39:23.096
Please, give this to your cousin.

39:23.130 --> 39:25.131
Wish him the best in his marriage.

39:28.002 --> 39:29.469
We'll see you soon

39:29.503 --> 39:32.105
under better circumstances, I hope.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.664
Hey.

39:57.698 --> 40:00.867
Did you know Dharavi
is completely green?

40:00.901 --> 40:03.469
The slums recycle the
plastics they scavenge.

40:03.504 --> 40:06.439
They melt them down into
different figurines and toys.

40:06.473 --> 40:08.041
It's pretty amazing

40:08.075 --> 40:10.877
to see all they do with
what little they have.

40:10.911 --> 40:15.582
Uh, this is Vishnu, the
Hindu god of protection.

40:17.985 --> 40:19.519
It suits you.

40:27.261 --> 40:29.162
It suits all of us.
