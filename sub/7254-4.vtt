00:00.335 --> 00:01.805
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

00:01.815 --> 00:03.665
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing ?

00:03.675 --> 00:05.185
I had a really great
time last night.

00:05.195 --> 00:08.526
Let's not make more
out of it than it was.

00:08.536 --> 00:09.597
You slept with dad?

00:09.607 --> 00:11.345
Yeah, I did.

00:11.355 --> 00:13.893
Is that why you and Luke broke up,
because you slept with dad?

00:13.903 --> 00:15.595
You don't belong with me.

00:15.605 --> 00:17.646
You belong with someone
like Christopher.

00:17.656 --> 00:19.322
You can go back to
being Lorelai Gilmore,

00:19.333 --> 00:21.861
and I'll go back to being the guy
in the diner who pours your coffee.

00:21.897 --> 00:22.703
I love you.

00:22.719 --> 00:25.282
I know the other night didn't
mean for you what it did for me.

00:25.298 --> 00:27.321
But I don't regret it and haven't
stopped thinking about it.

00:27.358 --> 00:30.010
And if I have to wait until we're
both 80 years old for you to see it,

00:30.045 --> 00:32.061
then I'll wait.

00:32.077 --> 00:34.572
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

00:34.587 --> 00:36.373
- I already got you a ticket.
- You're kidding.

00:36.408 --> 00:39.213
I got it right here. I was gonna fedex
it to you. You'll have it by tomorrow.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.160
Tell your mom you're not
gonna be home for Christmas.

00:41.195 --> 00:42.582
Christmas?

00:42.947 --> 00:44.542
Hi, Chris.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.581
Let me bottom-line it for you.

00:48.596 --> 00:50.932
Snakes are gross.
Snakes are scary and slithery,

00:50.945 --> 00:52.951
and do you know where
snakes do not belong?

00:52.966 --> 00:54.641
- On a plane?
- They do not belong on a plane.

00:54.676 --> 00:55.953
It's not an ideal situation.

00:55.966 --> 00:58.230
They do not belong
anywhere except in cages

00:58.246 --> 01:00.423
stuck in safes buried deep,
deep underground.

01:00.436 --> 01:02.030
- I hate snakes!
- So I'm gathering.

01:02.048 --> 01:05.010
With their gross, no-legged bodies,
and their scaly, scaly skin,

01:05.036 --> 01:07.021
and their wiggling,
and their hissing.

01:07.035 --> 01:09.952
Okay, Lor. I respect your very
valid feelings about snakes.

01:09.966 --> 01:10.590
Thank you.

01:10.608 --> 01:12.891
But I have to say we
were fairly warned.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.120
No! No!

01:14.135 --> 01:16.171
A movie should not
just be its title.

01:16.188 --> 01:18.470
"Driving miss daisy" didn't
all take place in the car,

01:18.486 --> 01:21.062
"Dances with wolves" wasn't
one long wolf dance.

01:21.078 --> 01:23.272
But this was nothing
but snakes, snakes,

01:23.286 --> 01:25.283
relentless snakes,
snakes on a plane.

01:25.296 --> 01:27.021
Snakes, snakes,
snakes on a plane!

01:27.036 --> 01:28.950
This was our fifth
bad movie in a row.

01:28.966 --> 01:30.191
It's got to be some
kind of a record.

01:30.225 --> 01:32.663
We got to face facts--
movies have gotten bad.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.791
Unless it's our fault.

01:33.806 --> 01:35.580
What? No,
we didn't make the bad movies.

01:35.597 --> 01:37.443
No, we made the movies bad.
Think about it.

01:37.456 --> 01:39.110
We are the common factor.

01:39.125 --> 01:39.932
Ohh.

01:39.946 --> 01:41.433
All the movies --
very different.

01:41.446 --> 01:43.543
Different genres --
different languages, even.

01:43.555 --> 01:46.083
We saw them in different
theaters at different times.

01:46.098 --> 01:47.241
What do they all
have in common?

01:47.277 --> 01:48.702
They were all seen by us.

01:48.715 --> 01:50.181
- Wow!
- Huh?

01:50.196 --> 01:51.951
We can never see
"Casablanca" together.

01:51.965 --> 01:53.860
I mean, I'm very sorry.
I don't care how much I love it,

01:53.895 --> 01:57.412
but I will not be responsible
for ruining "Casablanca."

02:00.718 --> 02:02.131
So...

02:03.817 --> 02:07.833
So... we should
divvy up the candy.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.479
- Divvy...
- The candy.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:12.515 --> 02:15.130
Got half the Milk Duds.

02:15.146 --> 02:18.102
Sour Patch Kids --
hmm, a third.

02:18.116 --> 02:22.102
Twizzlers -- you got about 5 --
4 3/4 -- you pick.

02:22.116 --> 02:23.360
Yeah, I'll take the Twizzlers.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.260
No, I meant besides
the Twizzlers.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.612
I tell you what --
you can have it all.

02:27.936 --> 02:29.872
Such a gentleman.

02:49.675 --> 02:51.042
We should...

02:51.058 --> 02:53.243
- Yeah, I should, uh...
- I should...

02:53.797 --> 02:55.232
Okay.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.880
Yeah.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.030
Okay.

02:59.927 --> 03:02.490
- Good night, Lor.
- Good night, Chris.

03:15.926 --> 03:16.920
Hi.

03:16.938 --> 03:20.052
Well, well, someone is cutting
it pretty close to curfew.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.032
Did  you guys have a good time?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.062
Yeah, really good.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.512
Ooh, is it weird that
he didn't come in?

03:23.545 --> 03:24.611
- Weird for me?
- Yeah.

03:24.627 --> 03:27.182
Oh, I saw the guy two days ago.
I'm sick of him.

03:27.197 --> 03:28.783
- Is it weird for you?
- No. No.

03:28.796 --> 03:31.311
Okay. He could come in
if you wanted him to.

03:31.325 --> 03:32.572
I mean,
I could make myself scarce.

03:32.608 --> 03:34.752
Oh, no, you wouldn't have
to make yourself scarce.

03:34.766 --> 03:38.041
Oh, then I could be un-scarce. I could
be here in all my plentiful glory.

03:38.055 --> 03:38.932
That's more normal.

03:38.948 --> 03:41.361
God, I forget what the protocol is
when your mom is dating your dad.

03:41.398 --> 03:43.702
Yeah, me too.
We'll have to consult Emily Post again.

03:43.716 --> 03:44.770
Yeah.

03:44.786 --> 03:47.043
But I really don't
think it would be weird.

03:47.057 --> 03:48.952
- It wouldn't?
- No. I mean, if it was,

03:48.968 --> 03:51.801
it wouldn't be weird in a bad way.
I mean, if that's what you want.

03:51.818 --> 03:52.641
Okay.

03:52.657 --> 03:53.900
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

03:53.936 --> 03:56.353
No. Not now. Maybe...

03:56.365 --> 03:58.741
I want it.
I don't know. Twizzler?

03:58.758 --> 04:00.382
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:03.266 --> 04:05.060
It's good, though. You know?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.622
He and I, between us --
it's -- it's going good.

04:08.635 --> 04:09.901
Well, good.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.450
Yeah, when I had lunch with him the other 
day, he said things were really good.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.483
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.497 --> 04:14.723
What'd he say?

04:14.738 --> 04:16.130
Um, nice things.

04:16.146 --> 04:17.291
Oh, yeah?

04:17.305 --> 04:19.151
- Yep.
- Like what?

04:19.418 --> 04:20.743
Nice things.

04:20.755 --> 04:23.270
Did he talk about my sparkling
eyes and my glossy, raven hair?

04:23.285 --> 04:25.200
Look, I'm not gonna pass
notes between you guys.

04:25.218 --> 04:27.513
What if Emily Post says that's
part of the appropriate protocol?

04:27.548 --> 04:29.873
If you can get it in writing
from the ghost of Emily Post,

04:29.885 --> 04:32.801
then I will pass as
many notes as you want.

04:33.245 --> 04:35.852
- But, mom...
- Yeah?

04:35.866 --> 04:38.362
I'm really glad things
are good between you.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.560
- Me too.
- I'm just...

04:40.768 --> 04:42.051
Yeah?

04:42.065 --> 04:43.981
I just want you to be careful.

04:43.997 --> 04:45.343
Is this the safe-sex talk?

04:45.356 --> 04:47.481
Because even if the ghost of
Emily Post says it's okay,

04:47.515 --> 04:48.761
it is just plain weird.

04:48.778 --> 04:51.742
No. Mom, I want you to be
careful with you, with him.

04:51.755 --> 04:55.091
I just...
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

04:55.105 --> 04:57.431
I am. I am being careful.

04:57.448 --> 04:59.972
Okay.  Good.

05:00.385 --> 05:03.673
Oh, my gosh.
Am I coming with you to college?

05:03.685 --> 05:04.492
Excuse me?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.891
You totally want me to come
to Yale with you, don't you?

05:06.907 --> 05:07.910
What?  No.

05:07.927 --> 05:10.960
Then why are you packing all of
my clothes -- my pink t-shirt?!

05:10.978 --> 05:13.161
- Where'd that come from?
- Oh, my goodness.

05:13.175 --> 05:16.851
That is so nice of you to
think of me in school --

05:16.867 --> 05:18.691
My sweet skirt!

05:18.707 --> 05:20.051
I hope you brought a toothbrush

05:20.066 --> 05:23.122
'cause, boy, oh, boy,
are we gonna have fun!

05:23.137 --> 05:24.752
My cozy sweater...

06:21.187 --> 06:24.632
Okay, two eggs over-easy,
hash browns cooked well,

06:24.647 --> 06:26.640
whole-wheat toast buttered, and

06:26.657 --> 06:29.212
with a side of marmalade.

06:29.686 --> 06:31.583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:31.596 --> 06:33.621
All right, what can I get you?

06:34.543 --> 06:38.531
Kirk, you're scaring
away the customers.

06:39.047 --> 06:42.143
I am not gonna ask you what's wrong.
Either eat or go.

06:42.159 --> 06:44.852
Women troubles, Luke.
Haven't slept in days.

06:44.866 --> 06:47.512
See the bags under my eyes?
See the glazed look?

06:47.528 --> 06:48.222
Women.

06:48.235 --> 06:50.341
See this glazed look?
Don't care.

06:50.357 --> 06:53.461
Mom's been incredibly possessive lately,
as has Lulu,

06:53.477 --> 06:54.892
and it's very tense.

06:54.906 --> 06:56.770
I noticed they were beginning
to snipe at each other,

06:56.807 --> 06:58.790
but I figured it was
a friendly competition

06:58.806 --> 07:00.602
I could work to my advantage,
you know?

07:00.617 --> 07:02.720
When you've got two women
making you sherry cobbler,

07:02.737 --> 07:04.572
you're likely to end up with
some pretty good cobbler.

07:04.607 --> 07:05.802
Basic capitalism.

07:05.815 --> 07:07.172
That's not how they see it.

07:07.185 --> 07:10.821
Oh, no. Apparently,
it's mom's cobbler or Lulu's cobbler.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.993
- I've got to choose.
- Are you gonna order something?

07:13.008 --> 07:14.892
I'd love to order something.
I'm starving.

07:14.908 --> 07:16.192
But what should I get?

07:16.206 --> 07:18.681
Lulu would want me to get something hip,
like a bagel.

07:18.695 --> 07:19.362
Hip?

07:19.377 --> 07:21.990
But mom would say a growing boy
needs something more substantial,

07:22.005 --> 07:22.901
like pancakes.

07:22.918 --> 07:25.203
Well, neither of them are here,
so what do you want?

07:25.215 --> 07:29.230
I don't know!
Bagel, pancakes, bagel, pancakes...

07:29.246 --> 07:31.672
It's like their voices
are blocking out my voice,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.521
and I don't know what
I think anymore.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.683
I'll have a bagel and pancakes,
I guess.

07:36.695 --> 07:39.281
Yeah, what kind of bagel?

07:39.296 --> 07:41.503
Lulu would kill me if I got the onion,
you know,

07:41.526 --> 07:43.052
'cause of all the kissing --

07:43.067 --> 07:45.383
and mom would freak
over the poppy seed

07:45.398 --> 07:48.011
'cause she thinks poppies
are a gateway drug.

07:48.028 --> 07:50.932
What about... egg?

07:50.946 --> 07:52.923
Egg, it is.

07:53.797 --> 07:54.862
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.321
I didn't expect you till later.

07:56.335 --> 07:58.152
I know, but I wanted 
to go over April's schedule

07:58.188 --> 07:59.592
before I brought her by.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.130
- Is this a good time?
- Sure, let's sit.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.471
Great.

08:03.576 --> 08:06.502
So, this is her schedule.

08:06.515 --> 08:08.971
I think I erred on the
side of too many details.

08:08.986 --> 08:10.391
I like details.

08:10.408 --> 08:12.232
These are some of the phone
numbers you might need --

08:12.266 --> 08:15.610
pediatrician, dentist, orthodontist --
if her retainer breaks --

08:15.627 --> 08:17.701
- optometrist...
- If her glasses break.

08:17.717 --> 08:20.483
So, my mom has her back
surgery on monday,

08:20.495 --> 08:22.782
but, apparently,
the recovery process is really slow,

08:22.796 --> 08:24.952
so I'm gonna be in New
Mexico at least two weeks.

08:24.967 --> 08:28.502
It's fine. April can stay with
me as long as you need her to.

08:28.516 --> 08:31.460
Thanks. I really
appreciate this.

08:31.948 --> 08:34.841
- All right, so what's this packet?
- Right.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.530
Registration forms,
some waivers --

08:36.547 --> 08:38.821
April will need to have this when
she goes to school tomorrow.

08:38.855 --> 08:41.429
And she will tell you she
needs to be there at 7:30,

08:41.446 --> 08:43.931
but she really doesn't need
to be there until 8:00.

08:43.946 --> 08:45.683
Anyway, it's all in the notes.

08:45.698 --> 08:48.132
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

08:49.557 --> 08:51.691
Okay, maybe a little.

08:51.706 --> 08:52.890
It'll be fine?

08:52.907 --> 08:55.742
It will be fine. I promise.

08:57.216 --> 08:59.992
Wow! Today's secret
ingredient is gourds!

09:00.008 --> 09:01.403
Aren't they beautiful?

09:01.418 --> 09:03.453
I  guess that depends
on the beholder's eye.

09:03.468 --> 09:05.831
Jackson's whole squash
crop went crazy this year.

09:05.847 --> 09:07.071
We had such a hot summer,

09:07.085 --> 09:09.140
and these babies love the sun.

09:09.156 --> 09:10.463
You've got to try this soup.

09:10.475 --> 09:11.842
Wait, is that gourd soup?

09:11.856 --> 09:14.192
It's so good.
It's sweet and rich.

09:14.207 --> 09:15.893
It's like pie, only it's soup.

09:15.907 --> 09:17.141
It's like pie soup!

09:17.155 --> 09:18.563
No, I don't eat orange food,

09:18.577 --> 09:20.400
- except for candy corn.
- You eat cheetos.

09:20.418 --> 09:21.800
I don't eat food that's
naturally orange.

09:21.835 --> 09:22.673
You eat oranges.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.150
I eat food that's naturally orange,
but I don't eat gourds.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.230
Fine.

09:26.246 --> 09:27.630
What else is going on at home?

09:27.645 --> 09:31.203
Ooh! Martha is so close to walking.
She's right on the verge.

09:31.217 --> 09:33.523
Why don't you come over
tomorrow night for dinner?

09:33.537 --> 09:35.761
Maybe you'll see
the inaugural steps.

09:35.797 --> 09:37.932
Um, I'd love to, but...

09:37.948 --> 09:41.400
But you want to wait to see if 
Christopher calls and asks youout first,

09:41.417 --> 09:43.240
and then if he doesn't,
you'll come over.

09:43.258 --> 09:44.770
Something like that, yes.

09:44.786 --> 09:47.021
You two have been seeing quite
a bit of each other lately.

09:47.057 --> 09:48.420
Yeah, we're just dating.

09:48.436 --> 09:51.913
Right, 'cause you can just
date the father of your child.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.970
Turns out you can.

09:53.987 --> 09:56.792
It's been a fun six weeks.
We're taking things slowly

09:56.806 --> 09:58.993
And just getting to
know each other again.

09:59.008 --> 10:02.323
Except for the fact that you've known
each other for more than 30 years.

10:02.336 --> 10:06.433
Okay, I get it. Please get off my back,
and stop talking like this.

10:06.445 --> 10:10.680
Okay, it's just that you and Luke
haven't been broken up all that long.

10:10.695 --> 10:14.102
I know. I remember.
I was there.

10:14.555 --> 10:19.503
Okay. It's -- you know, after
breaking up out of a big relationship

10:19.517 --> 10:21.593
it's normal to have
a rebound thing.

10:21.607 --> 10:25.062
You know, a big, bouncy,
rubber ball of a rebound thing.

10:25.078 --> 10:27.022
- It's... good.
- But?

10:27.038 --> 10:29.812
But a rubber ball is
a 28-year-old surfer

10:29.826 --> 10:33.023
or a jazz saxophonist
who drives a V.W. bus

10:33.038 --> 10:34.993
or a really cute guy that
can't even spell his last name.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.063
It's not the father
of your only child.

10:37.078 --> 10:39.931
Christopher is not
your rubber ball.

10:39.945 --> 10:40.750
Okay.

10:40.768 --> 10:43.120
He's a big, heavy bowling ball.

10:43.135 --> 10:44.573
I'm gonna tell
him you said that.

10:44.585 --> 10:45.842
I just want you to be careful.

10:45.858 --> 10:48.680
Okay, God, I feel like I should
set up traffic cones around me

10:48.698 --> 10:51.333
for all the people
worrying about my safety.

10:51.348 --> 10:53.580
I am being careful, okay?

10:53.597 --> 10:54.431
That's all I want.

10:54.447 --> 10:55.833
- All right.
- Great.

10:55.848 --> 10:56.742
- Fine.
- Good.

10:56.755 --> 10:58.013
- Good.
- Better.

10:58.026 --> 10:59.401
Hi, Chris.

10:59.418 --> 11:01.263
So Lor, what's your life
looking like tomorrow night?

11:01.296 --> 11:02.230
You available?

11:02.245 --> 11:03.682
Well, I don't know,
is there some particular reason

11:03.718 --> 11:05.710
you're checking
my availability?

11:07.268 --> 11:09.691
Well, I have an idea
for a really fun date,

11:09.706 --> 11:11.512
and if, in fact,
you are available,

11:11.526 --> 11:13.521
I will put thought into action.

11:13.535 --> 11:15.411
I thought our last
date was pretty fun.

11:15.426 --> 11:16.791
Well, this will
be even more fun.

11:16.807 --> 11:18.731
"Snakes on a boat"?!

11:18.937 --> 11:20.823
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

11:20.838 --> 11:23.243
Okay,  I'll be there at
6:00 to be picked up.

11:24.158 --> 11:28.013
Sorry. These gourd
rinds are really thick.

11:28.027 --> 11:29.721
What is the, uh, fun date?

11:29.735 --> 11:30.862
No hints.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.293
I hate not knowing things.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.270
I know. I'll see you tomorrow.

11:34.286 --> 11:36.013
Okay. Bye.

11:36.027 --> 11:38.170
Sounds like somebody's
got a date.

11:38.188 --> 11:40.002
- Sookie.
- Sorry.

11:40.017 --> 11:41.950
- Sounds like somebody's got a date.
- Nice.

12:12.777 --> 12:15.142
Hey, this is Logan Huntzberger.
Leave a message.

12:15.158 --> 12:17.050
Hey, it's me.

12:17.065 --> 12:19.060
I just got back to Yale.

12:19.075 --> 12:21.950
I thought I would try you
and see if you're there,

12:21.968 --> 12:23.511
but you're not.

12:23.528 --> 12:26.753
I thought you would be,
but you're not.

12:26.766 --> 12:29.153
Fascinating, my thought process,
isn't it?

12:29.166 --> 12:31.752
Okay, I'll talk to
you later. Bye.

12:36.427 --> 12:37.450
Hey!

12:37.467 --> 12:40.042
Well, hello, Rory.
You sound chipper.

12:40.065 --> 12:41.710
Oh, hi, grandpa.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.101
You're back at Yale?

12:43.116 --> 12:45.140
Yep. Back at Yale.

12:45.156 --> 12:46.480
Tell her the good
news, Richard!

12:46.495 --> 12:47.631
I'm coming to that.

12:47.648 --> 12:50.580
- It's very exciting!
- What's exciting?

12:50.595 --> 12:52.851
Well, when I was at my
Yale class reunion,

12:52.865 --> 12:56.991
I had a chance to meet one of my
former classmates, Harold Laken.

12:57.006 --> 12:59.851
You know him as the dean of
undergraduate education.

12:59.868 --> 13:01.650
Harold was also a
fellow Whiffenpoof.

13:01.665 --> 13:04.690
- The news, Richard!
- Yes, right. Well...

13:04.706 --> 13:08.703
It seems there was a sudden vacancy
in the economics department,

13:08.718 --> 13:11.351
and they need someone to
teach a course this semester,

13:11.366 --> 13:13.951
and Harold immediately
thought of me.

13:13.968 --> 13:16.642
Can you believe it?
Your grandfather, a professor!

13:16.657 --> 13:18.531
I'm just a visiting lecturer.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.592
Too starchy. Too starchy?

13:20.606 --> 13:22.893
- No, I like -- I like --
- Too starchy.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.983
What I want to know is whether
you'd be okay with this.

13:25.998 --> 13:27.861
I'm gonna be on the campus
at the same time you are,

13:27.898 --> 13:30.060
and there's a chance we
might run into one another.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.041
I promise,
you will not cramp my style.

13:32.056 --> 13:34.412
Well, that's wonderful,
because I have to admit,

13:34.428 --> 13:36.253
I'm really quite
excited about it.

13:36.268 --> 13:38.191
That's great,
grandpa. Congratulations.

13:38.205 --> 13:40.491
Well, why don't we meet
up after your first class

13:40.506 --> 13:42.563
and grab dinner and celebrate?

13:42.575 --> 13:44.090
Oh, I would love that,

13:44.105 --> 13:46.862
but I've already scheduled
dinner with Harold.

13:46.877 --> 13:49.973
But, Richard, we have dinner
with the Sudburys on thursday.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.490
Remember? We're going
to the Hill House.

13:51.525 --> 13:54.040
Well, I'm sorry, Emily,
but I have dinner with the dean,

13:54.058 --> 13:56.583
and you can't expect me to
include the Sudburys in that.

13:56.597 --> 13:58.070
They are insufferable bores.

13:58.085 --> 13:59.500
No, of course not.

13:59.516 --> 14:02.032
I'll just have to have dinner
with the Sudburys alone.

14:02.047 --> 14:04.600
Oh, the life of
a faculty widow!

14:04.618 --> 14:07.020
Did you hear that, Rory?
She's already turned on me.

14:07.037 --> 14:08.600
I heard it, grandpa.

14:08.615 --> 14:12.362
Razor blades? They've expressly
forbidden razor blades?

14:12.377 --> 14:13.573
That's sound policy.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.820
Are kids at this school
showing up with razor blades?

14:15.838 --> 14:18.132
I mean, listen to this list
of stuff they've had to ban.

14:18.147 --> 14:21.423
Drug use, bullying, graffiti,
theft, spitting, fighting --

14:21.435 --> 14:25.341
including but not limited to punching,
kicking, gouging, and biting.

14:25.356 --> 14:27.280
Seems to me like they're
just giving the kids ideas.

14:27.316 --> 14:29.451
"Gee, I can't think of any
other bad things to do today.

14:29.486 --> 14:32.642
Let me look at the manual.
Hey, gouging sounds fun!"

14:32.657 --> 14:34.941
No one at that school
is gouging anyone.

14:34.955 --> 14:37.660
Well, sure. Why bother with
that when they've got access to

14:37.677 --> 14:40.043
guns, tasers, knives,
and nunchakus?

14:40.057 --> 14:42.663
Nunchakus are cool --
and deadly.

14:42.675 --> 14:45.300
That's ridiculous. Nobody's bringing
nunchakus to April's school.

14:45.316 --> 14:46.673
Of course not.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.322
They're way too bulky
to fit in your sock.

14:48.356 --> 14:49.972
- Now, mace, on the other hand --
- Mace?

14:49.986 --> 14:51.121
Kids are walking
around with mace?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.700
Oh, honey, calm down.
Nothing's gonna happen to April.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.541
They just spell out that stuff
for their legal protection.

14:56.557 --> 14:59.253
Whenever you're taking care of kids,
that's a lot of liability.

14:59.267 --> 15:00.803
It's the same with
my dance school.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.311
And nothing bad ever happens?

15:02.328 --> 15:03.663
Nothing ever happens.

15:03.675 --> 15:05.742
Oh, except for that one time.

15:05.756 --> 15:07.132
What one time?

15:07.147 --> 15:08.722
Well, I took my
senior ballerinas

15:08.738 --> 15:10.912
to try out for a performance
of "The nutcracker,"

15:10.925 --> 15:12.892
and one of the girls
pulled a Tonya Harding

15:12.907 --> 15:15.523
and knocked the front-runner for
Clara out of the competition.

15:15.538 --> 15:17.113
Broke her leg in three places.

15:17.126 --> 15:19.851
That is not nothing.
That is the opposite of nothing.

15:19.867 --> 15:22.951
It's totally different.
That was a much rougher crowd.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.900
Rougher crowd?
They're ballerinas.

15:24.918 --> 15:26.203
Oh, yeah. I know.

15:26.215 --> 15:29.542
Everyone thinks, "ballerinas --
so sweet, so fragile."

15:29.558 --> 15:31.792
Trust me,
they're dancing on stress fractures

15:31.808 --> 15:35.241
and ingrown toenails,
and they haven't eaten in weeks.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.772
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late.

15:36.787 --> 15:38.143
We were half-way here
and April remembered

15:38.175 --> 15:40.860
the avocado pit was still in the
kitchen, so we had to go back.

15:40.878 --> 15:43.080
We had to make to
make a pit stop.

15:43.098 --> 15:44.951
- Hey, honey.
- Hi!

15:44.967 --> 15:46.870
- You remember miss Patty.
- Sure!

15:46.885 --> 15:48.151
- And Kirk.
- Yo.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.293
- And Caesar.
- Hey, April.

15:49.308 --> 15:51.611
I hate to have to rush,
but I actually have to rush.

15:51.628 --> 15:52.983
That's fine. You go.

15:52.997 --> 15:55.331
- Bye, mom.
- Ooh, I love you, sweetie.

15:55.348 --> 15:56.672
- Say hi to grandma.
- I will.

15:56.687 --> 15:58.941
- I'll call you when I get there.
- Okay.

15:58.955 --> 16:00.061
Take care of her.

16:00.076 --> 16:01.192
I will.

16:01.207 --> 16:02.932
Okay, then.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.511
So, is there somewhere
I can put the pit down?

16:08.525 --> 16:12.272
Oh, you know what?
Go on upstairs, and I'll bring the bags.

16:14.927 --> 16:18.051
Look at that turnout.
And the hips of Anna Pavlova.

16:18.065 --> 16:20.443
You must bring her
to my ballet class.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.050
Where ballerinas are maiming each
other to be in "The nutcracker"?

16:23.087 --> 16:25.241
Fat chance of that.

16:28.008 --> 16:30.743
Okay,  here we are.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.531
You remember the place.

16:32.545 --> 16:34.110
All right.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.512
Here's your bed,
and here's the desk.

16:37.526 --> 16:39.053
I thought you could do
your homework on it.

16:39.086 --> 16:41.422
A little chair for reading.
I know how you like reading.

16:41.437 --> 16:43.462
And this is your dresser.

16:43.476 --> 16:45.790
Now, if you have a hanging bag for,
like, dresses,

16:45.807 --> 16:48.811
you can just hang it in my closet,
but I don't seem to remember

16:48.827 --> 16:51.073
- you wearing a lot of dresses.
- Not big on dresses.

16:51.086 --> 16:54.733
All right, what else?
Here's your kitchen, my bed,

16:54.748 --> 16:57.510
bathroom's back there,
and the TV.

16:57.527 --> 16:59.210
I had a remote but I lost it,

16:59.225 --> 17:02.711
so you're gonna have to change the
channel by turning this knob here.

17:02.725 --> 17:04.430
And here's the telephone.

17:04.446 --> 17:07.603
If you're on it and you hear a
beeping sound, that's call-waiting,

17:07.617 --> 17:11.002
So you've got to hit the flash button
to switch over to the other call.

17:11.018 --> 17:12.573
Maybe I should
write all this down.

17:12.587 --> 17:13.560
Oh, sure! Sure!

17:13.577 --> 17:16.080
I was just kidding.
I know how call-waiting works.

17:16.098 --> 17:17.792
Of course you do.

17:17.808 --> 17:21.200
You probably also know how to open up
a refrigerator and turn on a sink.

17:21.217 --> 17:23.403
Okay, well,
I'll get out of your way,

17:23.416 --> 17:25.310
and you let me know if
you need anything. Okay?

17:25.327 --> 17:28.451
Actually, my avocado
pit needs light,

17:28.468 --> 17:31.180
and it's kind of dark in here.

17:31.198 --> 17:33.581
Well, there will be a little
more light in the morning.

17:33.598 --> 17:36.162
Will there be less
brown in the morning?

17:36.176 --> 17:39.412
You know, this place is kind
of depressing, isn't it?

17:39.427 --> 17:41.311
I'd say.

17:41.585 --> 17:43.472
Sorry if that hurt
your feelings.

17:43.488 --> 17:47.470
Mom says bluntness isn't my
most attractive quality.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.583
Well, maybe we can
pick up a few things.

17:49.598 --> 17:51.492
I don't know,
some pillows, a rug.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.190
You know, lamps --
lamps brighten.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.670
Hey, we could go to "targét."

17:54.685 --> 17:56.191
Oh, sounds kind of fancy.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.020
No. No,
that's just how we say "Target."

17:58.037 --> 17:59.793
Oh, never been.

18:00.318 --> 18:02.372
Wow. Um...

18:02.388 --> 18:05.090
I don't think I've ever met a
person who hasn't been to Target.

18:05.108 --> 18:07.620
Well, now you have,
so if you say that's the place to go,

18:07.636 --> 18:09.783
- so that's where we'll go.
- It's the place to go.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.511
Okay, so how about tomorrow,
after I close up?

18:12.527 --> 18:13.572
- Cool.
- Cool!

18:13.587 --> 18:15.361
- I'll let you get settled in.
- Okay.

18:15.377 --> 18:16.731
All right.

18:28.868 --> 18:30.760
Everyone, congratulations.

18:30.778 --> 18:34.051
The first issue of the year
is officially locked down.

18:34.136 --> 18:36.582
And special kudos to Bill
for landing the front page

18:36.595 --> 18:38.683
with his campus housing exposé,

18:38.698 --> 18:40.393
"Dormitory or death trap?"

18:40.408 --> 18:41.400
Nice alliteration.

18:41.415 --> 18:42.703
Slugline's half the battle.

18:42.716 --> 18:45.063
Dormitory renovations --
that's quaint.

18:45.077 --> 18:47.911
I recently had the opportunity to be a
fly on the wall at the Hartford courant

18:47.948 --> 18:49.971
as the editor selected
their lead story.

18:49.988 --> 18:52.473
It was down to the wire,
and I was on the edge of my seat

18:52.488 --> 18:55.161
when at the last second,
a local-corruption story broke.

18:55.178 --> 18:57.603
It was thrilling.
It made this place look like a joke.

18:57.618 --> 18:59.672
- Your point, Paris?
- Oh, I thought I was clear.

18:59.687 --> 19:01.781
Compared to the courant,
this place is a joke.

19:01.796 --> 19:03.273
Okay. Assignments.

19:03.285 --> 19:05.512
Bill, you'll go with part two
of the campus-housing series.

19:05.547 --> 19:06.141
Got it.

19:06.158 --> 19:08.180
We need someone to cover the
board of trustees meeting.

19:08.216 --> 19:09.693
- I'm on that.
- Thanks, Joni.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.882
And I want to do the traditional
freshman class composition article,

19:12.898 --> 19:15.832
but I think we need to go deeper
than just ethnicities and hometowns.

19:15.845 --> 19:18.290
I mean,
what is the class of 2010 really about?

19:18.305 --> 19:19.742
Maybe take a different look.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.951
At the courant, they use indesign to
integrate the words into the photos.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.873
Gee, Paris, do you happen to
have an "in" at the courant?

19:24.908 --> 19:26.640
Like, maybe your
boyfriend, Doyle?

19:26.656 --> 19:27.850
What is he, a fact-checker?

19:27.865 --> 19:30.131
The most requested
fact-checker at the paper.

19:30.148 --> 19:32.303
He works seven days a week just
to keep up with the demand

19:32.337 --> 19:33.440
for his fact-checking.

19:33.455 --> 19:35.640
Maybe he's looking to get
away from a certain lunatic.

19:35.655 --> 19:36.930
Jealous much, Sheila?

19:36.948 --> 19:38.463
Yeah. You got me.

19:38.475 --> 19:41.283
So, the art-show piece.
I've got a problem.

19:41.295 --> 19:42.791
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

19:42.805 --> 19:45.280
I kind of had a thing with one
of the artists in the show.

19:45.295 --> 19:46.342
Okay. Animal.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.483
I just can't do it.

19:47.497 --> 19:48.822
That's fine. I can do it.

19:48.838 --> 19:51.280
That's it. Class dismissed.

19:51.578 --> 19:53.843
So, you want to go to this
art-show thing with me tonight?

19:53.878 --> 19:57.203
Sorry, can't, Doyle's celebrating his
one-month anniversary with the paper.

19:57.215 --> 19:59.430
Having drinks with a bunch of the
staff bigwigs over at Duffy's.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.693
- Cool.
- Yeah.

20:00.706 --> 20:02.791
He's pretty loved.
Actually, we both are.

20:02.805 --> 20:04.681
We're like the Ephron and
Bernstein of the group.

20:04.715 --> 20:06.290
I think it's going
to be quite a fete.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.730
Doyle says the editor of the
metro section might even show.

20:08.747 --> 20:10.492
That's cool.
Well, I can just go by myself.

20:10.505 --> 20:13.282
You know, if you're desperate, you could
force one of these staffers to go with you.

20:13.318 --> 20:14.991
I used to do that all the
time when I was the editor.

20:15.027 --> 20:16.161
I dragged Bill everywhere.

20:16.176 --> 20:18.370
That is, until the time I picked
him up to go to the groundbreaking

20:18.408 --> 20:19.760
for the new chemistry
research building,

20:19.796 --> 20:21.313
and he was wearing
a cable-knit sweater

20:21.347 --> 20:24.102
that had "date" written all over it.
As if.

20:24.117 --> 20:25.503
I'm not desperate.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.942
Look, don't give me those
Rory Gilmore puppy-dog eyes.

20:27.956 --> 20:30.922
Even if I am your best friend,
I have to look out for my career first,

20:30.937 --> 20:32.493
then Doyle's, then you.

20:32.506 --> 20:33.560
Go to your party, Paris.

20:33.575 --> 20:35.550
Be the couple whose
divorce was so painful

20:35.567 --> 20:38.582
that it was memorialized in both
literature and film. I'll be fine.

20:38.596 --> 20:41.322
Oh, yeah. Now it's just sad.

20:50.885 --> 20:52.103
Huh!

20:52.117 --> 20:55.293
Um... kind of, uh, casual,

20:55.308 --> 20:57.513
seemingly routine
dating clothes.

20:57.528 --> 20:59.213
Was that intended
as a compliment?

20:59.228 --> 21:01.211
'Cause it didn't
come out like one.

21:01.297 --> 21:02.530
No, you look good.

21:02.548 --> 21:04.832
But I mean, how hard is it to look
good when you know where you're going?

21:04.868 --> 21:07.090
- Not that hard.
- I could get some points.

21:07.108 --> 21:08.900
I, on the other hand,
had to come up with an outfit

21:08.937 --> 21:11.470
that could easily convert from
totally formal to totally casual

21:11.486 --> 21:13.290
with just a few moves.

21:13.307 --> 21:14.763
Look, here I am, all ready

21:14.777 --> 21:17.440
for an elegant,
New York night on the town,

21:17.456 --> 21:19.312
carriage ride through the park,

21:19.328 --> 21:21.672
dinner at Pastis,
drinks at the Algonquin,

21:21.687 --> 21:25.182
but if I change my shoes
and throw on a cardigan

21:25.195 --> 21:26.570
and add necklace number two,

21:26.586 --> 21:29.151
then I am ready for a concert
at the New Haven Green,

21:29.165 --> 21:31.861
or I could use my cardigan to
cover up the security camera

21:31.878 --> 21:34.392
in case the date turns
into some sort of heist.

21:34.405 --> 21:36.211
I'd prefer the sexy
shoes to the sandals,

21:36.225 --> 21:37.770
but you should be comfortable.

21:37.785 --> 21:39.330
Comfortable?

21:39.346 --> 21:42.242
"Comfortable" like we're gonna
eat moroccan and sit on the floor,

21:42.257 --> 21:44.981
or "comfortable" like
we're gonna go up steps?

21:44.997 --> 21:47.683
Steps? Steps? Steps?
Are we going to the Mets?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.421
No hints.

21:50.385 --> 21:51.891
So, tell me now.

21:51.908 --> 21:53.543
Now! Tell me!

21:53.557 --> 21:56.360
Oh, hello, "Bullitt."
Are you taking me on a car chase

21:56.378 --> 21:57.811
through the streets
of San Francisco?

21:57.848 --> 21:59.150
- It's cool, right?
- It's really cool.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.352
- You like it?
- I love it.

22:00.365 --> 22:02.633
- So is this the thing?
- It's a thing.

22:02.648 --> 22:04.580
But is this the special
thing you planned?

22:04.598 --> 22:06.342
'Cause if it is,
I want to give it its due.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.740
If it's not, I want to have
the proper level of enjoyment

22:08.757 --> 22:11.392
while still reserving myself
for the actual special thing.

22:11.407 --> 22:13.411
The car is part of the thing.
It's not the whole thing.

22:13.447 --> 22:14.590
I don't want to peek too soon.

22:14.626 --> 22:15.602
Yeah, that's never good.

22:15.615 --> 22:17.452
Ooh, you're being a gentleman.
Is that the special thing?

22:17.487 --> 22:19.541
I always open your door.

22:19.558 --> 22:21.783
Bucket seats --
is that the special thing?

22:21.796 --> 22:23.860
No? Take a good,
long look at my hair now

22:23.877 --> 22:26.930
'cause it's not gonna look like
this for the rest of the night.

22:28.517 --> 22:30.753
Rumbly engine --
is that the special thing?

22:30.767 --> 22:31.982
Buckle your seatbelt.

22:31.996 --> 22:34.042
Buckling my seatbelt --
is that the special thing?

22:34.057 --> 22:36.512
Yeah, that's it.
You're all buckled up. Date's over.

22:38.445 --> 22:41.882
Look at this --
12-pack of socks for $6.

22:41.896 --> 22:45.711
24 socks for 6 bucks.
That's only 25 cents a sock..

22:45.725 --> 22:46.931
I knew you'd like it.

22:46.947 --> 22:48.313
Oh, this looks good.

22:48.327 --> 22:50.393
- You picked it out.
- Well, you said tablecloth.

22:50.408 --> 22:51.352
That's true.

22:51.365 --> 22:52.830
And what's the name
of that blue again?

22:52.868 --> 22:55.362
Uh, cerulean.
I'm really into cerulean.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.863
Yeah, I can see why.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.783
I used to be really into olive.
Everything was olive, you know?

23:00.798 --> 23:03.723
It was my backpack, my pants, 
my sneakers. It was all olive.

23:03.736 --> 23:05.913
And then one day, I just --
I woke up,

23:05.927 --> 23:09.383
and I was like, "olive?
I don't like olive.

23:09.396 --> 23:12.713
Not to wear, not to eat.
Olive -- Bleh."

23:12.918 --> 23:15.282
Well, you know what?
I'm really glad we did it.

23:15.296 --> 23:17.570
We had fun,
and the place looks great.

23:17.585 --> 23:19.591
And, you know, now,
anytime you want,

23:19.607 --> 23:22.491
you can have a nice
dinner on this table.

23:22.505 --> 23:23.752
That's true.

23:23.765 --> 23:26.480
You could put
flowers in this vase

23:26.497 --> 23:28.381
- and use it like a centerpiece.
- Uh-huh.

23:28.395 --> 23:32.001
You could dim the lights,
light these candles.

23:32.018 --> 23:34.252
You know,
we can do it tonight if you want.

23:34.268 --> 23:35.393
Yeah.

23:35.407 --> 23:39.443
Or, you know, you could do it
when you have a lady over.

23:39.457 --> 23:40.501
Oh?

23:40.515 --> 23:43.371
It'd be really nice.

23:43.385 --> 23:47.072
And she would be totally
comfortable in here now.

23:47.085 --> 23:48.850
Right. Uh, you know what?

23:48.865 --> 23:50.763
Why don't we, uh,
set up the desk lamp

23:50.777 --> 23:52.343
so you can get at
your homework?

23:52.355 --> 23:54.322
Actually, they don't give homework
on the first day of school.

23:54.356 --> 23:56.070
One teacher said he was
gonna give us homework.

23:56.106 --> 23:58.471
He even wrote it on the board,
but the homework was just,

23:58.487 --> 24:00.932
"cover your books."
How lame is that?

24:00.948 --> 24:02.650
- Very lame.
- I know.

24:02.668 --> 24:05.230
So I'll set it up so you
can get to it tomorrow.

24:05.247 --> 24:07.372
Cool. Um,
I'm gonna start covering my books.

24:07.388 --> 24:08.871
Can I grab some grocery bags?

24:08.885 --> 24:10.881
Yeah, go for it.
It's under the sink.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.300
You know,
you can admit it if you're lost.

24:22.338 --> 24:23.940
I will not lose any
respect for you.

24:23.957 --> 24:25.592
I'm not lost.

24:25.606 --> 24:27.411
Well, then,
are you planning to murder me?

24:27.426 --> 24:29.182
Because people will
notice I'm gone.

24:29.195 --> 24:30.442
They'll look for me.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.161
Paul Anka saw me leave with you.
He'll bark.

24:33.176 --> 24:35.740
He will bark,
and he'll sell you down the river.

24:35.757 --> 24:38.242
Chris! Chris!

24:40.795 --> 24:43.693
Good. Finally asking
for directions.

24:43.705 --> 24:45.461
We're here.

24:45.947 --> 24:48.702
Here, where? Are we at Woodstock?
I think we're late.

24:48.715 --> 24:51.181
Shh! Just give it a minute.

24:51.266 --> 24:54.313
Oh, are we meditating?
I think you need a word to repeat.

24:54.325 --> 24:55.391
I don't have a word.

24:55.408 --> 24:56.431
Stop talking.

24:56.445 --> 24:57.703
That's two words.

24:57.716 --> 24:58.932
Shh.

24:58.948 --> 25:00.092
Oh.

25:00.106 --> 25:01.521
"Shh." I like it.

25:01.537 --> 25:03.130
Shh...

25:03.145 --> 25:05.502
Ooh! What the --

25:26.368 --> 25:28.343
I love this movie.

25:29.156 --> 25:31.351
Check the glove compartment.

25:32.428 --> 25:35.160
Oh, my god.

25:35.175 --> 25:36.911
Hold this.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.783
And...

25:40.226 --> 25:41.953
popcorn.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.630
Oh, my god.
You're unbelievable!

25:44.647 --> 25:48.233
I thought it was time we saw a
movie we wouldn't complain about.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.880
"Good morning, Mr. Ascot."

26:05.285 --> 26:08.280
Mm-hmm.
But I have to tell you, Emily,

26:08.297 --> 26:10.561
it's a whole new world
from the one we remember.

26:10.576 --> 26:12.361
But the jacket was
still appropriate?

26:12.378 --> 26:13.851
Oh, the jacket was fine.

26:13.868 --> 26:16.173
Although I must say,
I felt wildly overdressed.

26:16.187 --> 26:19.612
Boys in undershirts and
filthy baseball caps --

26:19.626 --> 26:21.923
the girls wearing
pajamas and flip-flops.

26:21.938 --> 26:23.822
Well, it's the style, Richard.

26:23.836 --> 26:25.431
Well, it's most peculiar.

26:25.448 --> 26:27.873
And you were firm with them?
That's one thing that never changes.

26:27.908 --> 26:29.923
Young people respond
to discipline.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.522
After all, you don't want your
course to be known as a "gut."

26:32.537 --> 26:33.811
That's an easy class.

26:33.828 --> 26:35.982
I learned that term at
dinner with the Sudburys,

26:35.998 --> 26:37.833
who learned it from
their grandson, Paul.

26:37.845 --> 26:41.630
And how are the Sudburys?
I hope you gave them my regards.

26:41.648 --> 26:44.391
Of course. And they sent you theirs
and then proceeded to bore me

26:44.405 --> 26:47.130
with the details of every
stunning vista they witnessed

26:47.148 --> 26:49.181
on their recent
cruise to Alaska.

26:49.196 --> 26:53.042
If you ask me, they saw more of the
baked Alaska than anything else.

26:53.307 --> 26:56.152
You poor thing.
You have a disappointing evening,

26:56.166 --> 26:57.613
and I have to give
you the bum's rush

26:57.645 --> 27:00.092
to make my dinner with
Harold at the faculty club.

27:00.105 --> 27:01.950
That's all right.
You enjoy yourself.

27:01.967 --> 27:04.273
I probably won't wait up,
so I'll say good night now.

27:04.288 --> 27:06.181
Good night, dear.

27:12.428 --> 27:15.801
Oh, for Pete's sake! What now?

27:27.467 --> 27:29.232
License and
registration, please?

27:29.246 --> 27:31.552
Why do you need to see my license?
I wasn't speeding.

27:31.565 --> 27:33.091
You were on a cellphone, ma'am.

27:33.105 --> 27:34.481
I don't see how
that's your concern.

27:34.515 --> 27:36.260
Do my bills go to your office?

27:36.276 --> 27:38.561
It is illegal in Connecticut
to talk on a cellphone

27:38.575 --> 27:40.132
while operating a vehicle.

27:40.147 --> 27:43.573
Well, that is absurd. I can't talk
on my own phone in my own car?

27:43.586 --> 27:45.772
License and
registration, ma'am.

27:45.785 --> 27:48.823
If I can manage to drink a
cup of hot coffee and drive,

27:48.838 --> 27:50.342
I can talk on a cellphone.

27:50.358 --> 27:51.973
Or is coffee illegal, too?

27:51.986 --> 27:53.270
Can I listen to the radio?

27:53.287 --> 27:54.662
Can I open the
glove compartment?

27:54.675 --> 27:57.110
Perhaps you should outlaw
scratching your nose.

27:57.127 --> 27:59.723
That would certainly
cut down on accidents.

27:59.735 --> 28:01.422
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

28:01.436 --> 28:03.512
What? No!

28:03.526 --> 28:05.053
This is outrageous.

28:05.066 --> 28:07.350
You know, right now,
someone is robbing a kwiki mart,

28:07.367 --> 28:09.730
and you're standing
there harassing me.

28:09.918 --> 28:13.263
I'm going to need you to blow
into this breathalyzer for me.

28:14.706 --> 28:16.602
Young man,
I don't know where that's been,

28:16.618 --> 28:18.380
but I can say with
absolute certainty

28:18.398 --> 28:21.651
it won't be going
anywhere near my mouth.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.723
Excuse me. Do you know what
the light bulbs are all about?

28:44.767 --> 28:46.381
Shock in your system.

28:46.396 --> 28:48.153
Effective.

28:59.725 --> 29:00.913
What are you doing?

29:00.928 --> 29:02.473
Um, me?

29:02.488 --> 29:03.721
She's touching your art.

29:03.738 --> 29:06.763
What are you doing?
Are you actually drinking that water?

29:06.778 --> 29:09.300
Oh, um,
I didn't know that it was art.

29:09.317 --> 29:11.631
I thought it was
just a water cooler.

29:11.647 --> 29:13.101
There's no sign or anything.

29:13.117 --> 29:14.292
"Just a water cooler."

29:14.307 --> 29:16.620
That's her self-portrait.

29:17.696 --> 29:19.883
I'm kidding!
It's just a water cooler.

29:19.898 --> 29:20.903
Oh. Okay.

29:20.915 --> 29:23.013
We were just messing with you.
She is an artist, though.

29:23.026 --> 29:24.062
I made the horse.

29:24.077 --> 29:25.632
Oh, I really like that one.

29:25.646 --> 29:26.721
Well, thanks.

29:26.738 --> 29:29.100
Yes. It looks really big, too.
It looks bigger than the doorway.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.522
Yeah. Well, it turns out it is,

29:30.535 --> 29:32.923
as I found out four hours
before the show gonna start.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.670
I had to detach the head,
then reattach it when I got here.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.073
Does it look crooked?

29:37.085 --> 29:38.142
Um, not to me.

29:38.158 --> 29:39.603
- No, it does.
- If it does look crooked,

29:39.637 --> 29:43.022
which it doesn't, I think it looks
better then it did before -- more jaunty.

29:43.035 --> 29:44.053
What's it made out of?

29:44.065 --> 29:46.332
Cans mostly. Tinfoil.
A couple hubcaps.

29:46.347 --> 29:47.762
I do stuff with found objects.

29:47.778 --> 29:50.163
I mean, you could call it trash,
but that'd be kind of negative.

29:50.196 --> 29:51.781
She once made this
sculpture of an old lady

29:51.817 --> 29:53.602
out of plastic sandwich
bags and milk cartons,

29:53.636 --> 29:55.080
which was so cool.
She's awesome.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.252
Oh, shut up!

29:56.268 --> 29:57.923
So you're Olivia Marquont?

29:57.937 --> 30:00.300
- Impressive.
- What are you, a spy?

30:00.316 --> 30:02.430
Actually, I'm here for the paper.
I'm Rory.

30:02.445 --> 30:04.910
Oh, the press.
So what do you think?

30:04.927 --> 30:07.513
Honestly, I don't know.
I like your piece,

30:07.528 --> 30:09.813
and I think I like the
robot in the underpants.

30:09.827 --> 30:11.093
The robot is genius.

30:11.106 --> 30:12.862
Olivia thinks
everything is genius.

30:12.876 --> 30:13.973
Only genius stuff.

30:13.988 --> 30:15.363
So, you're on the paper?

30:15.378 --> 30:16.820
Oh, my god,
we used to be totally obsessed

30:16.855 --> 30:19.111
with this girl who was on the paper --
Paris Geller.

30:19.127 --> 30:20.580
- Sure.
- You know Paris?

30:20.596 --> 30:22.412
- I know Paris.
- Okay, freshman year,

30:22.426 --> 30:24.512
we were in this moral-reasoning
class with Paris,

30:24.525 --> 30:27.090
and she was the most intense
person we'd ever met.

30:27.105 --> 30:29.252
Um, she's pretty much
like that all the time.

30:29.266 --> 30:30.670
Actually, I went to
high school with Paris.

30:30.708 --> 30:33.153
Paris geller is a genius,
and I will go to the mat on that one.

30:33.186 --> 30:35.312
Okay, you've got to let us
show you the rest of the show.

30:35.347 --> 30:36.133
That's cool.

30:36.145 --> 30:37.542
Come on.
We'll help you with your article,

30:37.578 --> 30:39.662
give you the skinny
on everyone.

30:39.675 --> 30:41.581
Did you see the
light bulb thing?

30:41.597 --> 30:43.522
Um, my retinas
are still ringing.

30:43.538 --> 30:45.860
Our friend Joel did that.
He just transferred from M.I.T.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.490
Dude's wicked smart.
His work is always about technology.

30:48.505 --> 30:49.791
I think Joel's a genius,

30:49.807 --> 30:53.021
but I'll admit, I could be biased
by the fact that he's a total fox.

30:53.035 --> 30:55.152
Is that the guy in
the '70s prom tuxedo?

30:55.168 --> 30:57.791
No, that's Elijah.
He's doing a performance piece, actually.

30:57.808 --> 31:00.570
He's been doing it since we were juniors.
Who knows if it'll ever end?

31:00.588 --> 31:02.692
Okay, you've got to see
our friend Kasha's piece.

31:02.708 --> 31:05.741
It's called "Girl without
clothes," and it's far out.

31:05.955 --> 31:08.012
# You can't blame me #

31:08.028 --> 31:12.432
# For feeling avarice #

31:12.446 --> 31:16.561
# Oh, s'wonderful #

31:16.715 --> 31:20.850
# S'marvelous #

31:21.388 --> 31:25.350
# That you should care #

31:25.367 --> 31:29.853
# For me #

31:48.007 --> 31:51.572
Ooh, it's so good!

31:51.587 --> 31:55.150
It's so chock-full of...
words like "chock-full."

31:55.166 --> 31:56.770
And even if Audrey
Hepburn was 20

31:56.787 --> 31:59.413
- and Fred Astaire was, like, 80 --
- He's still Fred Astaire.

31:59.426 --> 32:02.212
I mean,
he could really tap-dance.

32:02.228 --> 32:04.030
That was so nice, Chris.

32:04.045 --> 32:07.003
That was so romantic
and fun and wonderful.

32:07.018 --> 32:09.202
- S'wonderful?
- S'marvelous.

32:09.217 --> 32:11.782
- I'm glad you liked it.
- I did. I really liked it.

32:11.798 --> 32:13.931
You know,
the evening doesn't have to end here.

32:13.948 --> 32:16.652
Gigi's staying with my mom.
We could go back to my place.

32:16.665 --> 32:19.112
Oh. That's nice.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.420
- Nice?
- No, that's not what I meant. Um...

32:23.437 --> 32:25.041
- We don't have to.
- No, I want to.

32:25.056 --> 32:27.342
- You do?
- I do, but I don't know if...

32:27.358 --> 32:29.020
- ...you want to.
- ...if I should.

32:29.036 --> 32:30.613
Okay.

32:31.928 --> 32:35.443
I mean, everything's good, you know?
It's going really good.

32:35.457 --> 32:38.422
- It's really good.
- Yeah, and I'm feeling good.

32:38.438 --> 32:40.100
But?

32:40.635 --> 32:45.382
I don't, uh...
know if I trust you.

32:46.045 --> 32:47.320
Really?

32:47.338 --> 32:50.761
Not just you. Me too.

32:50.846 --> 32:55.863
I'm not sure if I
trust us yet with this.

32:55.936 --> 32:57.561
Oh.

32:58.836 --> 33:01.040
It's scary.

33:01.056 --> 33:03.333
I'm scared, too.

33:03.346 --> 33:06.343
I just hoped maybe...

33:06.356 --> 33:10.822
we could stay here in this
place for a little while longer.

33:10.835 --> 33:13.043
Well, it's gonna
snow eventually.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.532
Right.

33:14.925 --> 33:17.240
It's fine. We should wait.

33:17.255 --> 33:18.672
I can wait.

33:18.688 --> 33:20.743
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

33:22.575 --> 33:24.290
Thank you.

33:24.975 --> 33:27.563
All this is perfect.

33:32.325 --> 33:34.402
Okay.

33:40.135 --> 33:41.890
Hello?

33:43.518 --> 33:45.320
This is she.

33:45.335 --> 33:46.820
What?

33:46.837 --> 33:48.803
Oh. Yes!

33:48.815 --> 33:50.542
What is it?
Who are you talking to?

33:50.558 --> 33:53.200
Is she okay? What did she --

33:54.247 --> 33:57.280
Okay. Where are you?

33:57.295 --> 33:59.581
Uh-huh. I know where that is.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.642
I'll be right there. Thank you.

34:02.656 --> 34:04.212
Okay, bye-bye.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.281
What?

34:05.295 --> 34:07.952
We have to go.
We have to pick up my mother --

34:07.968 --> 34:09.933
from jail.

34:10.317 --> 34:12.723
Your mother's in jail?

34:12.737 --> 34:15.040
Ooh, this night keeps
getting better and better.

34:15.058 --> 34:16.451
Let's go.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.991
You brush your teeth?

34:30.007 --> 34:31.179
They're brushed.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.663
So, there's a clear
path to the bathroom.

34:33.675 --> 34:35.179
Can I get you a night-light?

34:35.195 --> 34:36.992
I'm 13.

34:37.007 --> 34:38.530
I'll take that as a "no."

34:38.545 --> 34:39.870
I thought you didn't
have any homework.

34:39.905 --> 34:41.620
I don't.
This is more for pleasure.

34:41.637 --> 34:44.483
Sure. Sure,
a little light reading before bed.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.483
I love my biology teacher.

34:46.496 --> 34:49.112
She is so smart,
and she's really pretty.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.210
She has this long, brown hair

34:51.225 --> 34:53.342
that she kind of just
whooshes up into a clip.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.301
She has all these piercings,
but it's just on one ear,

34:55.338 --> 34:57.062
and she likes to fish.

34:57.076 --> 34:59.932
No kidding?
A pretty fisher/scientist woman.

34:59.948 --> 35:01.382
And I know she's single

35:01.398 --> 35:03.412
because last year her
name was Mrs. Johnson,

35:03.426 --> 35:06.150
and this year it's Ms.
Kaplan, so I was thinking,

35:06.166 --> 35:09.153
one day, I could conveniently
forget my biology book,

35:09.167 --> 35:10.831
and you could
bring it by for me,

35:10.846 --> 35:13.703
and then maybe you could...

35:13.717 --> 35:16.341
Have dinner at the candlestick
table with Ms. Kaplan?

35:16.355 --> 35:18.182
Exactly.

35:18.738 --> 35:20.310
Look...

35:20.658 --> 35:22.210
April...

35:23.106 --> 35:25.852
I guess you know
Lorelai and I broke up.

35:25.865 --> 35:28.380
Yeah, my mom sort of told me.

35:28.395 --> 35:30.631
Okay, well,
sometimes that happens, you know?

35:30.647 --> 35:33.420
Sometimes it doesn't
work out between people,

35:33.438 --> 35:35.121
and it's nobody's fault.

35:35.138 --> 35:37.093
It's all about pheromone.

35:37.108 --> 35:38.563
Right.

35:38.735 --> 35:41.412
But I want you to
know I'm okay,

35:41.427 --> 35:43.342
and you don't have
to take care of me.

35:43.356 --> 35:45.532
I'm here to take care of you.

35:45.545 --> 35:47.072
Okay?

35:47.388 --> 35:48.971
Okay.

35:50.608 --> 35:52.831
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:52.845 --> 35:55.773
Is it okay if I read a little
more before I turn out the light?

35:55.787 --> 35:57.310
- Real page-turner, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

35:57.328 --> 35:59.291
Mitosis is insane.

35:59.308 --> 36:01.302
Knock yourself out.

36:03.648 --> 36:07.212
Oh... got it! Thank you!

36:07.585 --> 36:09.492
- Am I smiling too much?
- You're smiling a lot.

36:09.505 --> 36:11.072
All right,
I'll try to bring it down a notch.

36:11.108 --> 36:12.840
Well, it's about time.
Oh, good.

36:12.858 --> 36:14.452
I get to walk this
filthy floor again.

36:14.466 --> 36:17.053
I don't need any help walking.
Thank you!

36:17.065 --> 36:20.320
Oh, thank you for giving me
things that already belong to me.

36:20.336 --> 36:23.012
Well, you can all be very
proud of yourselves.

36:23.027 --> 36:24.380
You're doing a crack job.

36:24.397 --> 36:27.220
You finally got menace-to-society
Emily Gilmore off the streets.

36:27.236 --> 36:29.012
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

36:29.028 --> 36:31.302
Come on. Put that thing away.

36:31.317 --> 36:33.051
One, two, three! Ah!

36:33.067 --> 36:34.851
Smile! Cheese!

36:34.865 --> 36:38.310
Oh, I got you already. I'll get --
Okay, later. Bye!

36:41.297 --> 36:43.252
Do you mind if I turn
on the music, mom?

36:43.266 --> 36:44.470
That's fine.

36:44.486 --> 36:46.663
Whatcha in the mood for?
"Jailhouse rock"?

36:46.677 --> 36:47.870
"Folsom prison blues"?

36:47.888 --> 36:49.253
You're very funny, Lorelai.

36:49.267 --> 36:52.071
No, no, no. I know, I know.
"Working on the chain gang."

36:52.087 --> 36:54.133
Yes, it's all quite amusing,
isn't it?

36:54.147 --> 36:56.382
My being arrested,
held behind bars,

36:56.398 --> 36:58.931
manhandled, and patted down?
Hardee-har.

36:58.948 --> 37:01.311
Aw. I just have one
question for you, mom.

37:01.328 --> 37:03.050
Why on earth did you call me?

37:03.067 --> 37:05.451
I mean, thank you very much
from the bottom of my heart

37:05.466 --> 37:06.870
for that incredible gift.

37:06.887 --> 37:08.990
You don't need to get me anything
for the next five Christmases.

37:09.028 --> 37:10.972
But why did you call me,
not dad?

37:10.987 --> 37:13.003
It was his first night
teaching at Yale.

37:13.017 --> 37:14.310
He was having dinner
with the dean.

37:14.346 --> 37:16.373
I'm not about to call him
so he can excuse himself

37:16.387 --> 37:18.901
to come bail his
wife out of jail.

37:18.916 --> 37:22.292
I can't begin to tell you how
incompetent our police department is.

37:22.306 --> 37:24.252
That officer Peters
who pulled me over --

37:24.267 --> 37:26.663
he's going to be receiving a big,
fat subpoena,

37:26.675 --> 37:29.000
and I'm not stopping there.

37:29.426 --> 37:31.021
Wait.

37:31.035 --> 37:33.960
What is this? What's this car?

37:33.978 --> 37:36.320
What's going on here?

37:36.626 --> 37:38.580
Are you two on a date?

37:38.598 --> 37:40.601
No way.
You are not changing the subject.

37:40.615 --> 37:42.941
We're not talking about anything
else except you in the clink.

37:42.976 --> 37:45.803
Now, come on. Spill.
What was it like on the inside, huh?

37:45.815 --> 37:48.131
Did you try to tunnel your
way out with a spoon?

37:48.145 --> 37:50.342
You know ? Did they try to make
you join a gang?

37:50.355 --> 37:52.310
And, mom,
now that you're on the outside

37:52.327 --> 37:53.512
and they're still
on the inside,

37:53.546 --> 37:55.861
are they gonna try to use you
as some kind of prison mule?

37:55.875 --> 37:59.440
I just --
so much I need to know!

38:01.028 --> 38:03.862
So, after my third callback,
he says to me,

38:03.877 --> 38:07.520
"a girl can't play Oscar Wilde. I want
people to take this production seriously,"

38:07.536 --> 38:09.293
like he's Peter
Brook or something

38:09.308 --> 38:11.772
And not some goateed
sophomore from Arkansas.

38:11.788 --> 38:13.673
So I give him my most
foppish stare and say,

38:13.686 --> 38:15.811
"life is too important
to be taken seriously."

38:15.825 --> 38:16.521
Nice.

38:16.538 --> 38:18.873
But on the way out,
as I'm making my dramatic exit,

38:18.885 --> 38:21.241
I walk right into the glass door,
like smack.

38:21.256 --> 38:22.343
No. Ouch!

38:22.355 --> 38:25.451
So the next semester, he keeps
hounding me about how I'd be perfect

38:25.466 --> 38:27.063
for his production of
"California suite"

38:27.068 --> 38:30.262
because I have such a
gift for physical comedy.

38:30.905 --> 38:34.110
Holy crap!
Your boyfriend is rich.

38:34.125 --> 38:36.732
And he's got some wild stuff.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.092
I mean, what's this about?

38:39.106 --> 38:42.193
Well, I must eat.
I'm positively famished.

38:42.207 --> 38:44.451
Nice sound system.

38:45.107 --> 38:46.690
Do you have popcorn?

38:46.708 --> 38:49.440
Um, yeah,
there should be some in there.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.892
You have a hell of a lot
of rice in here, Rory.

38:51.908 --> 38:54.332
White rice, brown rice,
long-stem rice.

38:54.346 --> 38:55.932
You are simply crazy for rice.

38:55.948 --> 38:57.490
Who doesn't like rice?

38:57.505 --> 39:00.402
Look who found an air popper!

39:00.415 --> 39:01.650
Genius.

39:01.668 --> 39:03.032
Now we just need some popcorn.

39:03.048 --> 39:04.963
Or something else that
could be cooked in here.

39:04.977 --> 39:08.771
Rice. Who's up for a late-night
snack of air-popped rice?

39:08.787 --> 39:10.722
Oh, wow,
that must be my Logan call.

39:10.736 --> 39:12.670
I didn't realize it
was so late already.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.640
Time flies when you're
partying with an artist.

39:14.658 --> 39:15.522
Hey!

39:15.538 --> 39:17.033
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:17.048 --> 39:18.871
What's going on?
You having a party there, Ace?

39:18.908 --> 39:20.761
Oh, no, I'm just hanging out 
with a few friends.

39:20.797 --> 39:22.281
- Just friends, huh?
- Yeah.

39:22.295 --> 39:23.613
Anybody I know, or...?

39:23.625 --> 39:25.283
No. Just some girls I met.

39:25.298 --> 39:27.481
- Hi, Logan!
- Hi, Logan!

39:27.498 --> 39:29.712
Just girls, huh?
Your new boyfriend's not over.

39:29.727 --> 39:31.883
Nope. Just us girls hanging
out in our underwear,

39:31.898 --> 39:34.213
throwing pillows at each other --
you know, girl stuff.

39:34.228 --> 39:36.312
Sounds very wholesome and loud.

39:36.325 --> 39:38.313
- Yeah, we're --
- Hey, Rory!

39:38.326 --> 39:40.190
Hold on just a sec. Yeah?

39:40.205 --> 39:42.852
This says it's popcorn,
but it looks so fancy.

39:42.868 --> 39:45.793
Can I open it, or are you saving it
for a special occasion or something?

39:45.806 --> 39:47.302
Go ahead.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.821
Hey, uh, sorry.

39:48.838 --> 39:50.863
Is it okay if I call
you back later?

39:50.876 --> 39:52.373
Sure, no problem. Have fun.

39:52.385 --> 39:54.453
I will. Love you. Bye.

39:56.867 --> 39:58.293
Is that too much popcorn?

39:58.307 --> 40:00.811
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm really hungry.

40:01.978 --> 40:05.590
Okay. Someone's got
some explaining to do.

40:07.758 --> 40:10.271
I mean, they escorted her
out in her stocking feet.

40:10.288 --> 40:11.382
Her shoes in a bag.

40:11.396 --> 40:12.953
Somewhere in my
youth or childhood...

40:12.968 --> 40:14.671
...you must have
done something good.

40:14.687 --> 40:16.261
The universe owed me this one.

40:16.277 --> 40:18.430
- I'm glad you had fun.
- I did. Didn't you have fun?

40:18.445 --> 40:20.111
Yeah, I did. It was great.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.253
It was one of the
"great" greats. What?

40:22.268 --> 40:25.093
Nothing. I feel I may have
gotten overshadowed a bit.

40:25.108 --> 40:27.021
I mean, how's my little barn
movie supposed to compare

40:27.058 --> 40:28.411
with your mom in jail?

40:28.428 --> 40:30.580
Chris, no!

40:30.597 --> 40:32.473
It was just the cherry on top,

40:32.488 --> 40:35.910
the mint on the pillow of what
was already a perfect night.

40:35.925 --> 40:38.743
No, I loved our date.
It was amazing.

40:38.757 --> 40:39.992
I loved the movie.

40:40.007 --> 40:42.903
I'll never forget the movie I saw the
night I picked my mother up from jail.

40:42.935 --> 40:44.642
You're never gonna get tired
of saying that, are you?

40:44.675 --> 40:47.493
"Picked up my mom from jail"?
No, I don't think I ever will.

40:47.507 --> 40:50.003
I'm just so glad you
were with me tonight.

40:50.018 --> 40:53.903
I mean, anybody else who
would have seen me laughing

40:53.917 --> 40:55.460
as I bailed my
mother out of jail

40:55.477 --> 40:57.213
would have just thought I
was completely deranged.

40:57.245 --> 41:01.202
Well, I know you're deranged but
for completely different reasons.

41:01.216 --> 41:03.601
I mean, you just get it,

41:03.617 --> 41:06.120
and you make everything fun,

41:06.136 --> 41:09.252
and it's so nice to be with
someone who understands you

41:09.268 --> 41:11.312
and makes you...

41:19.815 --> 41:21.763
I'll call you tomorrow.

41:23.045 --> 41:26.000
- Gigi's with her grandmother?
- She is.

41:27.497 --> 41:29.402
You want to come in?

41:29.567 --> 41:31.431
Yeah?

41:35.087 --> 41:36.833
Yeah.
