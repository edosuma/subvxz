00:24.880 --> 00:26.211
Don't worry about it.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.802
On-- on my first day, I forgot everything
that they taught me in those classes.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.603
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.046
I mean, day one's always
a little tough.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.889
It's like, you know, no matter
how the training goes,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.447
there's-- there's always room for something
that's just totally unpredictable.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.123
Oh, I--

00:41.240 --> 00:43.728
I've got a pretty good story for
you if you're ready for it.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.006
- OK.
- Hey, what's up?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.411
- Hey.
- Did you guys meet?

00:48.520 --> 00:49.969
No.
Nate.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.002
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.486
- Jessica.
- OK, listen up.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.768
So it's like my first week on the
job, and I'm at gate duty, right?

00:58.880 --> 00:59.961
What's that?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.724
If a kid wants to leave,
legally we can't stop them, so

01:01.840 --> 01:03.808
we put someone at the gate to
try and talk them out of it.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.243
Whoa, you got here quick.
I did.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.163
Good morning.
Hi.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.928
Nate, this is Grace.
She's your new boss.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.203
Hello.
Hey.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.042
Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.446
I would lose the tie
if I were you.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.289
And if you're listening to a
story of Mason's, understand

01:16.400 --> 01:17.686
that there's very little
reality in it.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.168
Hey, don't piss in the water
before we put our toes in.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.486
It actually feels
pretty mellow.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.722
OK, so Grace,
my wonderful new boss

01:24.840 --> 01:28.811
at the time, she leaves me at
my gate duty for like three

01:28.920 --> 01:30.081
hours without a
bathroom break.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.010
And I'm dying because I ate
the tacos that they serve

01:33.120 --> 01:36.088
here, and she failed to tell me
that they're a known laxative.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.768
So this kid, 16 years old, this
big fuckin' intimidating

01:40.880 --> 01:42.450
dude, he's like a foot
taller than me.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.769
He walks up and he just
cruises out the gate.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.808
It's my second day, so I don't
know what the hell is going on.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.527
But Grace, she's standing right
there, and she just lets it happen.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.323
Whatever.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.805
What I saw was Mason just
sitting there and Wesley

01:54.920 --> 01:56.445
smiling at me from the opposite
side of the gate

01:56.560 --> 01:59.086
because he knows that
we can't touch him.

01:59.200 --> 01:59.723
Why not?

01:59.840 --> 02:01.490
Once they're a foot outside the
gate, we can't touch them.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.123
So Grace tells me to follow
him, so I do for hours, just

02:06.240 --> 02:07.685
walking eight feet behind him.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.723
Eventually he gets on this bus,
so I get on the bus too.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.764
And at this point I can't think
of anything but whatever

02:13.880 --> 02:16.850
the hell these tacos are
doing to my bowels.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.371
Sol make up my mind,
fuck this.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.642
I've got to get off at the next
stop or I'm going to lose

02:20.760 --> 02:22.171
it in my shorts in front
of all these people.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.409
And exactly as I make this
decision, Wesley leans his

02:25.520 --> 02:28.205
big-ass head over to me from
across the aisle, and he says,

02:28.320 --> 02:31.722
really calm, I'm getting off at
the next stop, and if you

02:31.880 --> 02:36.688
do too, I'm going to rip your fuckin'
balls off and feed them to you.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.722
Holy shit.
Remember what I said.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.168
Hey now, this part is true.
I was there.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.802
- Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.607
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.129
So the bus stops.
He gets off.

02:46.240 --> 02:46.809
I wait a second.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.570
I go over to the door, but he's
just standing there on

02:48.680 --> 02:52.082
the sidewalk like 10 feet away,
staring at me, waiting.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.807
What can I do?
I have no other choice.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.921
So I step off the bus.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.089
And the second that my feet
touch the ground, it is like a

02:58.200 --> 03:03.491
knot in my asshole untied, and
the fiesta in my stomach just

03:03.600 --> 03:05.648
comes pouring down my legs.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.444
So I'm just standing there,
shit gushing down my thighs.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.767
I ruined my fuckin'
favorite Nikes.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.561
And Wesley is just there,
doubled over, losing it.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.126
And he's fuckin' laughing so hard.
I've never seen anything--

03:22.760 --> 03:24.921
Here we go, Nate.
Wait, what?

03:25.040 --> 03:28.206
Come on, Nate!
Go.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.367
Sammy!

03:30.520 --> 03:33.165
Sammy!

03:33.280 --> 03:35.089
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.005
Whoa, I got him.
Let go, you fucking perverts!

03:38.120 --> 03:40.051
OK.
Nate, grab his feet, please.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.628
Just going to sit down here in the
grass for a while until you de-escalate.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.085
De-escalate my asshole,
you duck fuckers!

03:45.240 --> 03:47.527
I'm not quite sure what
you mean by that.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.484
You know the drill, Sammy.
Just let it pass.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.969
You all right, buddy?

04:00.080 --> 04:04.529
Whoa, he got pretty far that time.
I think it's a new record.

04:04.680 --> 04:09.402
So anyway, after all that he
ends up coming back with me,

04:09.560 --> 04:13.889
but only because he's so excited to tell
everyone in our unit that I pooped my pants.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.763
And he does.
He tells everyone.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.724
Somehow it even got
back to my mom.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.969
You heard that story,
right Sammy?

04:22.079 --> 04:22.603
Yeah.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.329
How are you guys doing over there?
Fantastic.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.602
How are you feeling, Sammy?
You got it all out?

04:28.720 --> 04:32.006
You want to go take a nap?
All right, let's get you up.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.849
Up we go, bud.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.446
All right, I'll see you
back at the office.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.322
, man.
All right.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.411
This guy's been eating his
Wheaties in the morning.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.286
Have you ever thought about
the Olympics, Sammy?

04:49.400 --> 04:53.403
Running track?

06:19.720 --> 06:21.961
These are the files on our
kids, if you want to see what

06:22.080 --> 06:25.847
kind of crap they've been through.
How long do they stay here?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.486
Supposedly less than a year,
but we have a few that have

06:28.600 --> 06:29.601
been here a little over three.

06:29.720 --> 06:34.965
We just keep them until the county figures
out where they're going to go next.

06:35.120 --> 06:35.803
Tom!

06:35.920 --> 06:38.127
Go brush your teeth!

06:38.240 --> 06:40.083
Mmm.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.487
Remember, you are not their parent.
You are not their therapist.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.410
You are here to create a safe
environment, and that's it.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.043
Got it.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.929
And since you're new, they're
going to try and test you, see

06:48.040 --> 06:51.964
what they can get away with.
So just say no for a while.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.963
No.
OK.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.289
Kind of got to be an asshole
before you can be their friend.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.685
You're going to be fine.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.451
Community meeting is
in five minutes!

07:03.560 --> 07:07.564
- Luis, you better be up.
- Ugh, I don't want to be.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.008
So this is how it's
going to be?

07:15.160 --> 07:18.369
You've got five seconds.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.049
Fuck!

07:25.160 --> 07:27.970
Aah!

07:27.980 --> 07:28.669
Luis!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.844
I love you too.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.281
That's not cool.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.685
Kendra, will you be secretary
for us today?

07:55.800 --> 07:56.528
Sure, I guess.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.290
OK, thank you.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.724
Community meeting is
now in session.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.366
Community announcements?

08:07.280 --> 08:08.441
No announcements?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.289
What's going on, you guys?

08:10.400 --> 08:13.643
You look a little dead.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.769
What did you do to them?
I don't know.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.843
I farted when I was outside.
Maybe some of it followed me in.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.961
Did you shart yourself again?

08:21.080 --> 08:24.368
No, Luis, I did not shart,
thank you very much.

08:24.520 --> 08:29.086
And that happened one time, and
you weren't even here yet, so.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.327
It's still funny.
OK, are we done?

08:31.440 --> 08:33.530
I've-- I've heard that story
like three times today.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.607
Yeah, but it's a good story.
It is a good story.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.326
OK, if no one has any non-poop
related announcements, I have one.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.490
As most of you are already
aware, Marcus is turning 18

08:43.600 --> 08:46.082
and will be leaving us.
Can I have his room?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.325
We are going to be
throwing him a little party next week.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.807
Marcus, any requests?

08:54.800 --> 08:59.121
Can I shave my head?
I was talking about food for the party.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.042
No, I don't.
I don't want food.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.686
I want to shave my head.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.006
OK.
As long as I hold the razor.

09:14.120 --> 09:14.643
Cool.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.245
OK, everyone
else, thoughts?

09:16.360 --> 09:19.204
Food for Marcus' party, what
are we going to do?

09:19.320 --> 09:22.679
OK, OK.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.011
Everyone, one at
a time, please.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.009
Luis, thank you for raising your hand.
Who's the weird guy over there?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.566
Oh, that is Nate.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.807
Please do not be jerks to him.
It is his first day.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.723
Do you want to introduce yourself?
Um, sure.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.126
Great.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.359
Yeah.
Hey.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.761
Uh, as you know,
my name's Nate.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.642
And, uh, I just--

09:43.760 --> 09:46.047
I took a year off of school
because, you know, I just

09:46.160 --> 09:47.764
wanted to get some
life experience.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.850
And I always wanted to work
with underprivileged kids.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.530
Hey, what the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.051
Marcus,
settle down.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.906
No, I want to know what you
mean by that, "underprivileged."

09:59.320 --> 10:00.048
That's not what I meant.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.931
Then think about your fucking
words before you speak!

10:03.080 --> 10:04.161
Hey!

10:04.280 --> 10:05.682
Newbie!
That's a level drop.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.484
Go to your room.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.361
Go to your room.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.963
Sorry, man.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.809
Sorry.

10:22.240 --> 10:27.724
Um, levels and feelings,
you know the drill.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.968
Let's start with you,
Luis.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.963
Green.
Fine.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.848
Silver.
Whatever.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.286
Yellow.
I feel funny.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.048
Green.
All right.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.770
Yellow.
Annoyed.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.530
Short Term 12,
this is Grace.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.289
Right now?

10:52.400 --> 10:55.688
So what do you think?

10:55.840 --> 10:58.044
Hmm?
The new lamp.

10:58.160 --> 10:58.968
It's really a trip.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.004
You can turn it on and off by
touching the metal part.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.361
Try it.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.843
Cool, huh?
Hmm.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.167
Look, I'm supposed to be in a
group session like right now.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.691
You mind if we walk
and talk?

11:16.800 --> 11:19.729
No.
This is Jayden.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.207
She just got appointed
to us this morning.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.724
Her father's a friend of a friend,
real nice guy, very cultured.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.444
Why isn't she with him?

11:28.560 --> 11:32.042
Oh, he lost his wife
a few years back.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.491
Jayden hasn't made life
very easy on him.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.331
For the past couple of years,
she's been in and out of group

11:36.440 --> 11:39.125
homes for dangerous behavior.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.961
Last week she bit her
therapist's nose.

11:43.080 --> 11:43.569
Great.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.011
Yeah, so we'll have her during the
week, but she gets weekend home visits.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.443
All right.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.841
I told her father we'd
take good care of her.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.648
I take good care of everyone.
I know you do.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.560
That's why I'm trusting you to
do the same with Jayden.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.922
When does she get here?
She might be here already.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.087
I like your name, Jayden.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.929
It's a boy's name.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.769
Really?

12:21.880 --> 12:25.362
I don't think so.
Will Smith did.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.889
OK, well, these things you
can't keep in your room, but

12:29.000 --> 12:31.241
we'll keep them in the closet
out here, and you can check

12:31.360 --> 12:32.930
them out whenever
you want them.

12:33.040 --> 12:33.848
Yep, I know the rules.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.045
No belts, no razors, no
scissors, no fuckin' freedom.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.570
No cussing.
Shit, I forgot about that one.

12:42.920 --> 12:47.721
I'm going to let that one slip
because it was clever.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.364
All right.
Let's go see your room.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.690
Here it is.
Wow, it's so inviting.

12:55.800 --> 13:00.082
You can put whatever you want on the
walls as long as it's appropriate.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.043
So no pictures of penises?

13:02.160 --> 13:07.121
Not unless it's very
scientific.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.001
Oh, wow.
This is really cool.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.363
No, that's crap.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.967
If you call that crap,
I'm jealous.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.409
If you put your clothes
outside the door before

13:22.520 --> 13:26.366
bedtime, the overnighters
will wash them.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.929
And, um, you can't keep
your door closest.

13:31.080 --> 13:31.888
I don't do that anymore.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.525
I'm not
saying that you do.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.165
I mean, even if I ever did want
to cut myself, keeping

13:35.280 --> 13:36.725
the fuckin' door cracked
isn't going to stop me.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.205
I already warned you
about cussing.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.004
That one's going to
be a level drop.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.606
Oh no, a level drop.
What am I going to do?

13:43.720 --> 13:48.044
Your attitude is not helping
either one of us.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.003
Hey, what happened to that guy?
What guy?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.964
The big kid that made
you poop your pants.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.369
Wesley.
Yeah.

14:29.480 --> 14:34.402
He ran away again, and then two days later
someone found him dead in the bushes.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.049
What?

14:35.160 --> 14:37.288
That is the real ending
to the story.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.802
I don't like that part.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.007
Sugar, coming with me?
I'm going to clear my head.

14:43.120 --> 14:47.084
That was a good first day, Nate.
Thank you.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.449
See ya.
All right, man.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.003
Yeah, take it easy.
All right.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.049
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.966
Grace?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.162
Come on in, Hon.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.250
So the test did come
back positive.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.088
Lovely.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.771
How are you feeling?

15:30.720 --> 15:34.603
I already did, like, seven of
those tests at home,

15:34.620 --> 15:36.463
so I'm not really surprised.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.682
OK, well, you have a few
options to explore.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.767
And we can go over it for--

15:41.880 --> 15:44.486
We can just make an appointment
for Saturday.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.968
You don't want to hear
the other options?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.601
Uh-uh.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.963
OK.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.766
Have you ever been
pregnant before?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.731
One time.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.127
OK.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.208
Hey, stinker, what
took you so long?

16:30.320 --> 16:30.838
Oh, no.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.763
I didn't know you still
had that stupid hat.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.162
I will always have this stupid hat.
What's going on in here?

16:36.280 --> 16:38.487
Well, since you were out
cheating on me with your bike,

16:38.640 --> 16:41.689
I decided I'd make myself some
chiles rellenos, homemade

16:41.800 --> 16:44.724
tortillas, and my mom's
famous salsa.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.329
Mmm.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.249
Looks like there's
enough for two.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.929
All right.
I doubt it.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.011
Mase, you don't have to
be jealous of Floyd.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.847
Floyd?
Your bike has a name now?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.847
Of course he does.
We're very close.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.406
I don't know what
you see in him.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.929
Mmm.
Nice grip.

17:01.080 --> 17:01.763
Comfy seat.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.851
There is no way his seat
is as comfy as mine.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.728
You're right.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.161
I think I'm going to
go take a shower.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.645
Floyd got me all sweaty.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.287
I hate that bike!

17:14.400 --> 17:16.482
Fuck you, Floyd.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.171
OK, I'm done with mine.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.247
On, yeah.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.405
OK, yep.
Almost there.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.009
Um.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.569
Those are some crazy last-minute
changes you're making.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.604
Yeah, well, I really
suck at noses.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.087
OK, you go first.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.851
Aw, damn it.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.247
Yours are always so good.

17:54.360 --> 17:54.878
Thanks.

17:54.879 --> 17:58.123
I look like a homeless guy, though.
You do kind of look like a homeless guy.

17:58.240 --> 18:02.043
Oh yeah, thank you.
What's that on my face there?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.723
Oh, that?
Yep.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.409
Mmm.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.881
Well, that's the piece of
avocado that's in your beard.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.129
No.
Yes.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.643
Oh, fuck.
Yes.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.649
It's been there the whole time.
Ooh, yeah.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.000
So now you're all
nicely painted.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.969
Thank you for saying
something-- sooner

18:15.040 --> 18:17.324
I did.
I just--

18:17.440 --> 18:18.922
OK.
Um, all right, here we go.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.323
Just take it easy, OK, because you're
going to freak out when you see this.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.681
I think it might be
my best one yet.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.451
OK.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.726
Hmm?
Come on.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.561
Oh, wow.
You can't fuck with that.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.127
I can't fuck with that.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.683
That nose is amazing.
Yeah.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.963
And I was going for kind of a
mushroomy thing in there.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.445
Is that a beard?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.571
No.
I was, uh--

18:46.680 --> 18:49.087
I was trying to shade. I
think it looks pretty cool.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.009
Yeah, it looks very cool.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.929
What's growing out of my head?

18:53.040 --> 18:54.929
Oh, these?
Flowers.

18:55.000 --> 18:55.523
Mmm.

18:55.640 --> 19:00.408
They represent the peculiar thoughts
that grow out of your gorgeous mind.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.730
Why are you so nice to me?

19:09.560 --> 19:13.451
You being serious now?

19:13.560 --> 19:15.363
Mm-hmm.
Well, it's easy.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.485
It's because you are the
weirdest, most beautiful

19:19.600 --> 19:24.367
person that I've ever met
in my whole entire life.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.521
Whoa.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.562
Hmm?

19:43.680 --> 19:45.689
Um. Nothing.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.560
It's just been a long time since
you kissed me like that.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.841
That's not true.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.645
Well, we haven't had sex
in 9 days and 13 hours.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.288
Down to the hour, huh?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.687
Did I do something?

20:07.720 --> 20:08.846
No.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.167
You're wonderful.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.521
What is it, then?

20:17.440 --> 20:19.525
Hey.
Hey, hey.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.166
Please, you have to let me in
your head once in a while or

20:22.320 --> 20:24.129
I'm just going to go nuts, OK?

20:24.280 --> 20:26.248
Shh.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.124
Are you doing this
just for me?

20:48.080 --> 20:48.967
You OK?

20:49.080 --> 20:49.603
Yes.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.563
Yeah?

20:55.600 --> 20:57.967
You don't want me to stop?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.489
Stop.
Why?

21:14.600 --> 21:17.068
Stop!
Ow!

21:17.480 --> 21:19.448
Shit.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.487
What the hell, Grace?

22:13.920 --> 22:14.648
OK, everyone.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.650
I think most of you have already
met her, but we have a

22:17.760 --> 22:18.886
new member of our community.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.721
Jayden, would you introduce
yourself?

22:23.360 --> 22:26.489
Please don't be offended if I'm
not very friendly, but I'm

22:26.600 --> 22:29.729
going to be living with my dad
soon, and I don't really like

22:29.840 --> 22:31.888
wasting time on short-term
relationships.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.403
So, you know, it's
nothing personal.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.043
Wow.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.366
She seems like a really
nice girl.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.721
Hey, I think
we all can respect her space, OK?

22:41.880 --> 22:44.645
OK, what do we want to
play for rec today?

22:44.800 --> 22:45.642
Wiffle ball, dude!

22:45.800 --> 22:47.569
OK.
No, man.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.045
You're always playing
that stupid game.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.366
Because you always
suck at it.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.963
Until you get good at it, maybe
we could stop playing it.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.570
- Watch your mouth, bro.
- Both of you, cut it out.

22:55.680 --> 23:00.449
Any other suggestions?
Yes, Sammy?

23:00.560 --> 23:01.800
Can we play Big and Small?

23:01.920 --> 23:05.322
Is that a real game, or is that
a game you just made up?

23:05.440 --> 23:08.091
It's a real game that
I just made up.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.723
OK.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.923
Well, maybe you can explain
that to me later.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.362
Straight line, guys.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.882
I'm going to do room checks,
so I'll meet you.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.650
Oh, OK.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.809
Hi, Nas.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.284
Come on, guys.
Let's go, Shawnta, let's go!

24:52.400 --> 24:55.324
All right, we got
a baseball game.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.922
There you go.
You got this.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.688
Sammy.
Hey, yo, Sammy.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.281
Get-- get the ball!
Run, girl, run!

25:05.440 --> 25:08.284
Come on, Sammy!

25:09.800 --> 25:14.282
You too good for this game?
What?

25:14.400 --> 25:17.643
Too good for wiffle ball?

25:17.760 --> 25:20.366
I don't like sweat.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.051
Hey, you know what, Connor?
Just come-- just come closer.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.728
It's Marcus.
He ain't going to hit it.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.808
You sure you don't want
to get the fat bat?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.610
No?

25:29.800 --> 25:31.165
Strike one, everybody.

25:31.280 --> 25:31.849
Strike one.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.200
That wasn't no strike.
That was right down the middle.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.084
This is the big leagues, boy.
You can't handle it?

25:37.200 --> 25:40.761
Better keep flapping
them gums.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.721
Hey.
You want to jump rope with us?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.161
Um.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.487
No?

25:49.400 --> 25:50.731
Sorry.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.888
We're not supposed to.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.161
That's not what we meant.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.641
Can I hear?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.923
Strike three.
Change it up.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.681
Bet your ma is real excited
to see you next week, huh?

26:30.480 --> 26:32.043
Marcus!
What the fuck?

26:32.160 --> 26:33.047
Hey!

26:33.160 --> 26:35.003
What the fuck did you about
my mama, you little bitch?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.283
Hey!
Hey!

26:36.360 --> 26:37.247
What are you doing?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.566
Get your ass over
to the bench.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.047
Come on, come on.
Guys, get Luis out of here.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.009
Is Marcus OK?
You good?

26:43.160 --> 26:44.528
Yeah, I got it.
Luis, come on.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.163
Come on.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.730
OK, where-- where where--
where does it hurt?

26:46.840 --> 26:48.767
Come on.
Come on, sit over here.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.450
We're going to sit down for
a little while, OK?

26:50.560 --> 26:51.969
You OK, man?
How do you feel?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.921
Not good.
I mean, that-- that was crazy.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.122
They just fight like that?

26:56.240 --> 27:02.122
Nate, I'm not asking you
how you're feeling.

27:02.240 --> 27:02.809
Right.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.081
I'm sorry.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.567
How are you?

27:11.320 --> 27:14.802
You need to tell me what
the hell is going on.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.769
<i> Assault and drug possession.</i>

27:35.920 --> 27:38.764
You realize that's enough to get
your ass thrown in juvie.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.008
Do you think I give a fuck?

27:41.120 --> 27:44.329
You're out of here in
less than a week.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.883
You're so much smarter
than this.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.401
I know it's scary out there.
I ain't scared of shit.

27:55.520 --> 28:01.846
All I'm saying is, getting
thrown in jail is not what you

28:01.960 --> 28:03.803
want to do.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.922
My dad has been in there
for 10 years.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.930
I don't want that for you.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.125
- Straight to your room.
- No free time until all

28:40.280 --> 28:42.248
your chores are done.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.928
What's going on with him?

28:47.040 --> 28:49.691
He doesn't want to leave.

28:51.240 --> 28:54.210
Should I go talk to him?

28:54.320 --> 28:55.242
Yeah.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.762
All right, I'll just be inside
letting Marcus kick the

28:58.920 --> 29:02.968
shit out of me.
Have fun.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.766
You got some new lyrics you
want to try out on me?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.565
There's a lot of fucks in it.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.808
I won't tell.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.646
Mm-hmm.
Those are pretty much it.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.608
It's slow.
All right, let's see.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.882
Let's see here.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.126
Like that?

29:41.240 --> 29:46.009
Yeah.
All right.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.407
It don't matter
now, damn near 18.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.603
All the pretty pictures in
my fuckin' head is faded.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.963
And when I think about that
trick that raised me, I think

29:55.080 --> 29:57.606
about sick, because the
bitch is crazy.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.802
Fuck that bitch, nigga,
fuck that pain.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.082
Your body's in a ditch inside
this turned up brain.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.170
I mean, I can't see how you
claim it, you being ma?

30:05.320 --> 30:08.128
Doctors snatched me out the snatch
of pure evil with eagle claws.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.362
Ho, ho, ho, slut, fuck
the way you want it.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.245
Got your young, dumb son
pitching pigeons for money.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.886
I mean, it's colder than the
bitch when it's sunny.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.371
Blows raining down
on the glow.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.801
Got the nerve to tell
me you love me?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.529
I said, again?
Again?

30:21.640 --> 30:23.123
Sell it again?
Bitch, I'm 10.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.004
Let me go outside and function
with friends.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.849
You say you ma?
You mother?

30:26.960 --> 30:27.882
You the father-fucking queen?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.764
I say, all right, I love
her so I flip it again.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.884
No, not this time, bitch,
because I'm stronger than you.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.002
Not this time, bitch, swinging
harder than you.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.805
No, not this time, bitch, you
ain't leave me a choice.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.083
You just a body in a ditch
in the brain of a boy.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.123
All fucked up now,
damn near 18.

30:43.240 --> 30:46.528
All the pictures in my past
ain't never fading.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.120
I'm always wishing for something
amazing, but when

30:49.280 --> 30:51.408
your life is shit then
it ain't no trading.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.524
So put me in your book so you
know what it's like to live a

30:54.640 --> 30:56.802
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.003
Put a label on my head so you
know what it's like to live a

31:00.120 --> 31:02.885
life not knowing what a
normal life's like.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.767
Look into my eyes so you
know what it's like.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.168
Look into my eyes so you know
what it's like to live a life

31:11.280 --> 31:15.080
not knowing what a normal
life's like.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.240
Yeah, I--
I don't--

31:31.360 --> 31:33.966
I don't know what to say, man.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.282
It's cool, man.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.366
I just need to shave my head.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.327
You think Grace will
still shave it?

31:50.080 --> 31:52.481
I like the new wall decor.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.447
Thanks.
They're actually very informative.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.926
Can I draw with you?

32:18.360 --> 32:25.369
When I was 9 or 10, I used to
draw portraits of all my mom's

32:25.480 --> 32:26.561
boyfriends.

32:26.680 --> 32:30.526
And then I'd sell them to
her for $10 apiece.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.890
How many boyfriends
did she have?

32:35.000 --> 32:38.402
Enough that I was able to save
up and buy one of those

32:38.520 --> 32:44.129
portable CD players with
anti-shock protection.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.329
You're old.
Whatever.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.289
Those things were cool.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.281
You know what's weird?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.769
Whenever I was drawing portraits
of, you know, those

32:58.880 --> 33:03.329
guys, I would always
take forever.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.365
30, 40 minutes just stringing them
along, saying, oh, I've

33:07.480 --> 33:12.088
just got to do a couple
more shadows, or, I'm

33:12.200 --> 33:14.487
just fixing the nose.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.889
I don't know why I did that.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.925
I hated every single
one of them.

33:23.280 --> 33:27.410
Maybe you were just trying to
keep them away from your mom.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.168
Yeah.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.368
Maybe.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.523
Are you done?
Almost.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.202
I've just got to add a few shadows
and fix the nose a little.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.164
You are such a smartass.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.691
That's a level drop.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.889
Oh no, not a level drop.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.207
I wanted to play
foosball later.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.810
Hmm.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.605
Too bad.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.571
OK.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.808
Finished.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.161
You want to take a look?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.125
Looks great, Marcus.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.368
Check it out.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.848
Is it lumpy?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.806
What do you mean?

34:58.280 --> 35:00.726
I usually keep my hair long.

35:00.840 --> 35:04.481
It's where she used
to hit me at.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.807
Is it still lumpy?

35:09.320 --> 35:12.005
No way, man.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.929
Not at all.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.168
See for yourself.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.522
Pretty smooth.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.763
What about the back? No scars?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.405
No--

35:41.520 --> 35:43.649
no nothing?
Uh-uh.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.081
It looks really great.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.890
Mason.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.968
Hmm?

37:08.240 --> 37:10.891
I have something to tell you.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.804
Yeah?

37:14.960 --> 37:17.008
What's up?

37:24.640 --> 37:28.884
We're going to have a baby.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.805
What?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.491
We're going to have a baby.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.009
We are?

37:52.120 --> 37:54.043
Mm-hmm.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.201
Whoa.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.288
Whoa.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.810
Whoa.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.968
OK.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.969
Um.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.923
Um.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.566
Um.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.967
Uh, give me a minute.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.843
Oh. boy!

38:28.880 --> 38:30.325
Holy shit.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.329
Whoa!

38:32.440 --> 38:35.364
OK.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.522
Hey.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.925
You know we can do
this, right?

38:53.880 --> 38:58.807
Because we are going to be
some amazing parents.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.843
OK?

39:02.640 --> 39:05.246
I love you so much, Grace.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.446
So much it's insane.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.802
Let me see.
Hmm?

39:29.920 --> 39:32.048
You can't tell yet.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.367
Come on.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.808
That is so crazy.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.843
Hmm.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.409
Did you hear about Sammy?
What?

40:48.520 --> 40:50.727
Last night they took
all his dolls away.

40:50.880 --> 40:56.250
His therapist is calling it
a lesson in letting go.

40:56.360 --> 40:56.883
Bullshit.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.800
Those are all his
sisters, right?

41:00.920 --> 41:03.491
He's not ready for that.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.567
It's time for your
meds, Sammy.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.641
I'm sorry, bud.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.849
Jayden, meds.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.049
How'd you sleep?
Like crap.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.323
Can you tell the doctor I need
a higher dosage of Trazodone?

41:44.480 --> 41:47.370
Mm-hmm, I will tell him.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.526
Happy birthday.

41:53.720 --> 41:59.170
And it comes with this.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.601
Mason made that.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.969
Thanks.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.845
I heard your dad's
picking you up.

42:11.160 --> 42:15.447
Yep.
You excited?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.287
Whatever.

42:54.880 --> 42:58.443
Dan, you
have a visitor at the front gate.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.447
Dan to the front gate.

42:59.560 --> 43:04.168
The barber of Seville!

43:17.000 --> 43:18.331
Bye, Shawnta.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.327
Bye.
Bye, Shawnta.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.647
Bye-bye.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.800
To encounter
so many sharks can be--

44:47.200 --> 44:49.282
The fact that
this occurs on the eve of

44:49.400 --> 44:53.200
the summer solstice
left me wondering.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.564
Damn it.
Will you watch the kids?

44:56.680 --> 44:57.203
Sure.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.800
Nate.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.526
Jayden.

45:08.680 --> 45:13.288
Come on, you know you can't
keep the door closed.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.129
Stop pushing on the door.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.889
Hey.
Hey, Jade.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.604
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.689
Why can't she close her door?
She's a cutter.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.325
I can fucking hear you, dick!

45:22.440 --> 45:24.922
Maybe I'll just cut myself right now,
and you'll all lose your fucking jobs!

45:25.040 --> 45:25.768
Come on, Jade.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.168
Don't fucking
call me Jade, you bitch!

45:33.200 --> 45:35.047
Jayden, come on.
Please, just open the door.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.965
If you just open the door, then
we won't bother you anymore.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.088
If you're not going to open the
door, then we're going to

45:41.200 --> 45:41.883
have to force it.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.122
Can you help me?

45:44.240 --> 45:44.889
Yeah, yeah.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.047
Yeah.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.810
OK.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:49.760 --> 45:53.401
Get the fuck out of my
room, you fucking--

45:53.560 --> 45:54.288
stop touching me!

45:54.400 --> 45:55.970
All right, easy, easy, easy.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.809
One, two, three, down.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.729
Ah, fuck you!

46:01.240 --> 46:02.844
Luis, sit down.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.928
You're fucking squishing
me, you fatass!

46:08.040 --> 46:09.963
Sorry, how's that?

46:10.120 --> 46:10.723
Let me go!

46:10.840 --> 46:13.522
You shouldn't be here, Grace.
What's wrong, Mason?

46:13.640 --> 46:15.688
Can't handle me for yourself,
you weak-ass fuck?

46:15.800 --> 46:18.007
Need the bitch to
do it for you?

46:18.120 --> 46:19.281
Hold her good, Nate.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.051
Yeah, hold me good, Nate.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.049
Sorry, man.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.291
You're going to be OK, Jayden.
It's going to be OK.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.129
I hate you.

46:33.240 --> 46:37.643
I hate you.
That's fine.

46:37.760 --> 46:40.240
You don't have to like
me right now.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.767
Just let it pass.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.248
How we doing, Nate?

46:46.360 --> 46:50.043
Not so good.
You're doing good.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.726
You're doing really good.

46:59.280 --> 47:03.767
Grace,
how's my cupcake?

47:06.560 --> 47:09.689
The ancient islands are cold.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.522
How is she?
I guess she's in the cool-down room now.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.762
I need that.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.528
Common gray seals
can be found here in abundance.

47:18.640 --> 47:24.170
In fact, Scotland is home to 40%
of the world's gray seal

47:24.280 --> 47:26.647
population.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.842
Everybody grab one.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.602
Come on.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.811
You want to see mine?

48:06.760 --> 48:08.205
Shit.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.045
That one's from a sneeze.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.845
Slipped and cut too deep.

48:13.960 --> 48:16.850
Almost cut my achilles.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.242
Why?

48:21.360 --> 48:23.328
Hmm.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.601
My mom died.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.127
I went to live with
my dad and--

48:34.400 --> 48:37.927
it's impossible to worry about
anything else when there's

48:38.040 --> 48:40.281
blood coming out of you.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.247
God, I hate that thing.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.003
Me too.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.611
Take as much time
as you need.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.847
Happy birthday to you!

50:05.880 --> 50:09.002
Blow them out!
Blow them out!

50:09.120 --> 50:10.360
Go!

50:10.480 --> 50:12.445
Jayden!

50:12.560 --> 50:16.286
Jayden!

50:24.920 --> 50:30.563
Ah, big booty, big
booty, big booty!

50:30.680 --> 50:32.011
Big booty number four.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.571
- Number four, number five.
- Number five, number six.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.005
- Number six, number five.
- Number 5, number 10.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.201
Number seven, big booty.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.368
Big booty, number 10.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.925
Aw!

50:42.040 --> 50:44.964
Come on, she works here.

50:45.080 --> 50:46.206
She should be embarrassed.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.049
I am embarrassed.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.282
Hey, it's OK.
It happens to all of us.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.010
Let's go for another
round Ready?

50:52.120 --> 50:58.082
Ah, big booty,
big booty--

51:28.280 --> 51:29.805
Hmm, slow this down
a little bit.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.002
Yo, y'all ain't got
no rhythm, man.

51:32.120 --> 51:32.882
Tell me about it.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.206
I'm trying to keep
them in line.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.521
It's just so hard.

51:35.640 --> 51:37.529
Mase, I love you
like a brother but I got to

51:37.640 --> 51:40.962
say that when it come to being
discreet, you're a disgrace.

51:41.080 --> 51:44.448
I mean, he think we all don't
know about him and Grace on

51:44.560 --> 51:47.564
the low undercover
trying to date.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.130
I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.766
Uh, I'm out
the gate, right?

51:54.920 --> 51:55.443
My name is Nate.

51:55.560 --> 51:59.884
When I came here, y'all
tried to player-hate.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.321
Everyone sit down, please.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.568
We have an AWOL.

52:14.920 --> 52:16.206
Jayden!

52:16.360 --> 52:18.725
Grace!
Stay with the kids!

52:18.840 --> 52:20.968
I'll call you when I get her.

52:26.680 --> 52:30.167
This happens.
It's fine.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.681
Jayden!

52:32.800 --> 52:34.723
Jayden, can you slow
down, please?

52:34.880 --> 52:36.120
I feel like I'm going to barf.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.083
Keep-- keep the same distance.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.087
Stop!

52:39.200 --> 52:41.843
OK.
OK.

52:43.840 --> 52:47.242
You can't touch me
outside of the grounds.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.651
Well, can I walk with you?

52:51.760 --> 52:55.401
Walk all you want, but I'm
not going back there.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.401
Let's walk, then.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.680
Jayden, you know you're not
supposed to be here.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.561
Hey.
Um, we're at her dad's house.

54:26.680 --> 54:31.447
I don't think that anyone's
here, but she went in anyway.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.642
OK, thanks.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.642
He's not home?

55:03.160 --> 55:05.447
Do you want to go back?

55:12.120 --> 55:14.009
OK.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.442
You OK?

55:39.520 --> 55:41.807
I'll see you tomorrow.

55:43.680 --> 55:48.208
You want to hear a story
I've been working on?

55:48.360 --> 55:50.442
Of course.

55:57.760 --> 56:03.164
Well, it's a kid's story, so
there aren't any big words.

56:03.280 --> 56:05.282
OK.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.926
Once upon a time, somewhere
miles and miles beneath the

56:08.040 --> 56:11.567
surface of the ocean,
there lived a young

56:11.720 --> 56:13.802
octopus named Nina.

56:13.920 --> 56:18.130
Nina spent most of her time
alone making strange creations

56:18.240 --> 56:22.645
out of rocks and shells.
And she was very happy.

56:22.760 --> 56:26.731
But then on Monday the
shark showed up.

56:26.840 --> 56:29.650
"What's your name?"
said the shark.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.000
"Nina," she replied.

56:31.120 --> 56:34.886
"Do you want to be my friend?"
he asked.

56:35.000 --> 56:35.523
"OK.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.649
What do I have to
do?" said Nina.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.091
"Not much,"
said the shark.

56:40.200 --> 56:43.727
"Just let me eat one
of your arms."

56:43.840 --> 56:46.923
Nina had never had a friend
before, so she wondered if

56:47.040 --> 56:49.725
this was what you had
to do to get one.

56:49.880 --> 56:53.441
She looked down at her eight
arms and decided it wouldn't

56:53.560 --> 56:54.686
be so bad to give up one.

56:54.800 --> 56:59.442
So she donated an arm to her
wonderful new friend.

57:02.160 --> 57:02.683
Wow.

57:02.800 --> 57:05.565
Every day that week, Nina and
the shark would play together.

57:05.680 --> 57:10.049
They explored caves, built
castles of sand, and swam

57:10.160 --> 57:11.605
really, really fast.

57:11.720 --> 57:14.929
And every night the shark would
be hungry, and Nina

57:15.040 --> 57:18.681
would give him another one
of her arms to eat.

57:20.800 --> 57:26.648
On Sunday, after playing all
day, the shark told Nina that

57:26.760 --> 57:28.524
he was very hungry.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.005
"I don't understand,"
she said.

57:30.120 --> 57:33.310
"I've already given you six of
my arms, and now you want one more?"

57:33.420 --> 57:37.728
The shark looked at her
with a friendly smile and

57:37.840 --> 57:39.763
said, "I don't want one.

57:39.880 --> 57:46.570
This time I want them all."
"But why?" Nina asked.

57:46.680 --> 57:51.568
And the shark replied, "because
that's what friends are for."

57:54.680 --> 57:59.322
When the shark finished
his meal, he felt

57:59.440 --> 58:00.885
very sad and lonely.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.085
He missed having someone to
explore caves, build castles,

58:05.200 --> 58:08.522
and swim really, really
fast with.

58:10.680 --> 58:14.890
He missed Nina very much.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.366
So he-- he swam away to
find another friend.

58:32.760 --> 58:35.411
Jayden?

58:37.680 --> 58:40.411
Did your dad ever hurt you?

58:49.160 --> 58:51.561
Does he still hurt you?

59:30.800 --> 59:34.361
We can't let her
go back there.

59:38.920 --> 59:41.571
That's not going to happen.

59:45.920 --> 59:49.720
You were pretty amazing today.

59:49.840 --> 59:50.841
Thank you.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.964
Hmm?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.925
More, please.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.728
More for everyone.
More of everything.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.842
Anyone, dessert first?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.131
Dessert?
Dessert first?

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.884
Excuse me,
excuse me.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.047
Hello, hello.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.763
Hi.
Um.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.403
Ahem.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.244
But I'm going to say it in
English so I don't embarrass

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.647
myself any more than
I need to.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.765
Uh, I just want to take
a moment to say

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.531
thank you, Mama, Pops.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:10.130
I don't think anyone here thinks
of you as just our

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.571
foster parents.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.809
I don't even know what that
term means because to me,

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.810
you're just Ma and Pa.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.721
And I think I speak for everyone
here when I say,

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.081
thank you for taking us in.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.245
For taking me in when I was just
a punk kid who was scared

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.727
of everything.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.925
When I had no one else, you
accepted me and you showed me

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.008
what it was like--

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.686
um, what it was like
to be loved.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.170
And none of us would be here
if it weren't for you.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.365
Just look at this beautiful
family you made.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.242
So let's all lift our glasses
to our king and queen.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.811
Happy 30th, you guys.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.606
Everything good in my life
is because of you.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.243
Salud.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.885
Salud!

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.766
Will you marry me?

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.049
You're serious?
Yeah.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.322
I'm dead serious.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.408
Mmm.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.966
Who the hell is calling
on the land line?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.202
Hello?

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:24.603
Yeah.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.041
This is, uh, actually
her, uh, fiance.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.767
And if this is about her dad,
it'd probably be best if you

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.565
just let me relay the message.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.082
Mm-hmm.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.968
Oh, shit.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.686
Who was it?

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.722
Um.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.970
That was someone from the
probation department.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.125
They said that your dad's
probably going to get released

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.322
next month.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.309
Hey.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.084
I really think we need to talk
through some of this stuff.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.328
Not right now, Mason.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.003
I'll be fine.
I just--

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.646
I just need to work.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.969
Hey.
Hi.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.163
Marcus' fish died last night.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.406
What?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.447
He thinks Luis had something
to do with it.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.483
Did he?

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.406
Tell me you didn't do something
to Marcus' fish.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.968
What?
Luis, tell me.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.845
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.683
I swear!

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.561
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.886
It wasn't Luis.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.162
It don't matter.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.881
I'd like to be left alone,
if that's cool with you.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.923
OK.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.889
Just let me know if
you need anything.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.002
Have you guys seen Jayden?

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.122
Uh-uh.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.528
Jess?
Where's Jayden?

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.610
Oh, her dad showed up last night and
took her on pass for the weekend.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.805
What?
Jack signed off on it.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.611
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.641
How could you let her go?

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.203
Uh, Jan, let me call
you right back, OK?

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.249
The man called.
He apologized.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.850
He had a personal emergency.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.087
That's not even the point, Jack.
Did you read my report?

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.964
Of course I
did, and I was very concerned.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.004
But when Jayden's social worker
asked her about it, she

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.328
said her father had never
been abusive in any way.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.566
Of course she said that.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.567
She's fucking scared!

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.490
What the fuck did they teach
you guys in grad school?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.880
Jack, in her mind he is always
right behind her, watching her.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.886
When she is sleeping.
When she is taking a shit.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.930
When she is alone with her
therapist, he is right there

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.121
watching her, ready to pounce.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.050
And you just expect her to
just come out and say it?

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.082
Are you guys fucking stupid?

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.805
Because she was here asking for
help, and you just send

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.410
her back to the fucking shark.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.488
I realize you're upset, Grace.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.564
But yelling at me isn't
an effective form of

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.808
communication.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.121
OK.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.082
OK, Jack.
Jack, I'm sorry.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.443
Please cancel the pass until we
figure this out, because I

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.564
know her and I know that things
are not good at home.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.702
And how do you know that?

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.563
Because she read you
a children's story?

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
Don't fuck with me, Jack.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.529
I am on the floor every
day with those kids.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.723
And last night, that girl sat
next to me and she cried, and

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.049
she tried to tell me the only
way that she knew how.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.050
Grace, you are a line staff.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.401
It's not your job to
interpret tears.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.045
That's what our trained
therapists are here for.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.685
Then your trained therapists
don't know shit.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.327
Did she tell you that she was
being abused by her father?

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:32.348
She didn't have to.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:35.170
If I'm going to take that child
away from her biological

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.410
parent, yes, she does.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.247
This is bullshit.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:45.048
Grace, I have been working with these
kids longer than you've been alive.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.761
And there's not one of them
that I wouldn't die for.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.881
I look into those broken eyes.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.924
I want to go out and find the
asshole who did that to them

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.081
and beat the shit out of them.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.205
But although I feel that way
every single day, I know I

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.163
can't track down everyone
who's hurt them.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.090
I know I can't heal all their
wounds, and I can't start

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.445
accusing all their parents of
being sexual offenders.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.782
Especially when they're friends
of friends, right, Jack?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.085
We're finished here, Grace.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.808
Jan--

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.968
Sam.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.367
Marcus?

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.842
Marcus?

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.449
Marcus?

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.722
What are you doing
in Luis' room?

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.762
Oh, no.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.769
Luis?

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.968
Luis!

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.963
What?
No.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.209
Shit.
Shit!

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.843
Mason!
Somebody, anybody come!

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.643
Help me!
Luis!

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.770
Luis, I need your pillowcase right now.
Give it to me.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.247
Quicker, please.
Marcus?

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.962
Marcus.
Marcus, please look at me.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.842
Marcus, look at me.
You're going to be OK.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.611
I just need you to look at me.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.724
Marcus, look at me.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.684
What the fuck is
taking so long?

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.406
Now I
have a real friend.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.209
I'm going to call
you, uh, Dudley.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.571
Dr. Stone--

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.842
Blake
Johnson, dial 93, please.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.566
Blake Johnson, dial 93.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.524
They still don't
know anything.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.086
I can't do this.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.369
Grace.
Hey.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.521
Grace, where are you going?

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.722
I can't do this.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.843
OK, let's go.
Let's go.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.007
I'll drive us home.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.360
Don't want to go home.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.882
That's not what I'm
talking about.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.764
I know it's been a really
fucked up day, OK?

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.125
Mason, you have no idea what
I'm going through right now.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.482
Then tell me.
That's how this works.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.921
You talk to me about it so that
I can take your hand and

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.168
fucking walk through
this shit with you.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.009
That is what I signed
up for, OK?

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.967
But I cannot do that if
you won't let me in.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.367
I can't.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.287
I'm sorry.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.603
You're sorry?

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.882
Grace, are you serious?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.731
I've been waiting for you for
a really long time, and I

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.049
wouldn't take a second of it
back because I love you so

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.406
goddamn much, OK?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.842
But I have been waiting for
three years for you to tell me

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.968
why you still don't trust me.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.481
I've been waiting for three
years for you to just once

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.001
take the advice that you give
your kids every fuckin' five

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.044
minutes and learn to talk
about what's going

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.367
on inside your head.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.801
You can't do that for me?

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.724
Whatever it is, OK,
just talk to me.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.800
But I can't do this.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.048
I can't--

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.646
I can't marry you.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.000
I can't have your baby.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.731
I can't have any of it.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.647
I can't do it.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.606
So what do you want to do?

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.403
Hmm?

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:41.728
Do you want to get
an abortion?

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.764
I already made the
appointment.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.761
Do whatever you want, OK?

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.769
Because I'm done.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.802
Kids don't
care nothing about it.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.163
Ed, do you
want some vittles today?

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.611
I do, Granny.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.688
I worked up a right smart appetite
fetching sticks for old Duke.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.962
Yes, that's
the trouble around here.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.525
The critters are taking over.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.369
Billie Mae has done made pets out of
everything but my pickled turnips.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.164
What are we going to
do for vittles?

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.010
Wait, I remember
someplace to drive near--

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.210
What are you doing?

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.643
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.886
Are you going crazy?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.727
Probably.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.727
When I was your age, I had to
stand in a courtroom with a

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.084
bunch of strangers and tell
them all the ways

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.441
that he abused me.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.646
What he hit me with.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.008
How he got drunk.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.881
How he forced me to take
a shower with him.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.202
Got me pregnant.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.367
I sent him to prison.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.885
I didn't talk about it.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.480
I didn't think about it.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.082
Until I met you.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.929
And I don't know.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.930
I have a baby inside of
me, and I don't know.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.805
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.403
I was just trying to help you.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.971
Oh my god.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.004
He loves the belt.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.485
It's such a cliche.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.490
Jayden, we have to do
something about this.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.171
Should go bash his face
in with a baseball

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.521
bat while he's sleeping?

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.129
Uh, we should get
out of here.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.925
He'll sleep through anything.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.600
OK.
Now we should get out of here.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.128
They're going to ask you
a lot of questions.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.720
It's going to be hard.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.842
I'll try to leave out the part
about you breaking into

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.884
that house with a
baseball bat.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.289
Thanks.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.008
You're going to be
a really good mom.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.601
I told him this was going to be
the last time I came home.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.769
Because I'm not going to
take his shit anymore.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.128
And that set him
off, of course.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.641
But I didn't care.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.322
I'm sorry.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.328
I didn't mean what
I said earlier.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.882
I'm just really messed
up right now.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.851
Marcus is going
to get better.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.527
I think I am too.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.242
Grace, I know talking like
this is really hard.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.651
But this is our fourth session
together, and I'd really like

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.922
you to try, OK?

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.289
I don't really know
what to say.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.882
Your dad's getting out
of prison in a week.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.328
Do you want to talk
about that?

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.442
OK.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.929
Are you OK?

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.003
Mm-hmm.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.403
Watch that monitor
over my shoulder.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.127
I think he's-- there we go.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.322
There he is.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.768
Stay with it.
Hang on a second.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.809
Hang on.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.447
That's-- that's the baby's
heartbeat, man.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.483
Oh, man.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.328
So you need to get ready for
this because it's so fucking

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.009
unbelievable.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.282
It's going to seem fake, but
I promise you it's not.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.726
Grace will vouch for it.
It depends if you tell it right.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.490
There is no way not
to tell this right.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.602
It is a storyteller's
wet dream.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.647
What?
Get ready for this.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.485
OK, just in time.
I'm going to start at the beginning, OK.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.169
OK.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.648
So three years ago, right, we have
this girl here named Liza Green.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.849
She's 17, older than everybody
else on the unit at the time.

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.203
And I don't mean this in a pervy
way or anything, but

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.321
she's real pretty.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.202
She was gorgeous.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.561
All the guys on the unit want
her, but she won't give any of

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.648
them the time of day because
she was busy.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.761
She was always studying.
She was very smart.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.208
Mm-hmm.
Really smart.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.928
So two weeks before she turns 18 and
leaves, we get this new intake.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.802
It's a 15-year-old guy.
He's really tough.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.563
He's really quiet.
But he's cool.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.569
He's just kind of like kicking
back, checking out the scene.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.523
And I swear I didn't hear him say a
word the whole first week he was here.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.602
But then one day we were doing community
meeting, and we ask for announcements.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.846
And this guy raises his hand.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.327
And he looks directly at Liza Green and
he says, I know you don't know me.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.009
I just got here.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.770
But I just want to say that
I've been watching you.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.803
I think you're the most
interesting thing about this

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:21.563
place, and I'm really sad I'm not going
to get to know you before you leave.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.125
I just wanted to
tell you that.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.969
What a pimp!

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.168
What did she say?
Nothing.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.207
Nothing?
It was so awkward.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.885
Yeah, so fuckin' awkward
I couldn't stand it.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.162
And then she left, and
never talked to him.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.561
The kids teased him
for like a year.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.449
Aw.
Oh, that blows.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.008
No, he didn't give a shit.
No, didn't even faze him.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.881
It was like he knew something
everybody else didn't.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.287
Who is this guy?
That was Marcus.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.167
What?
I never heard this story.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.762
Oh, wait.
It gets so much better.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.602
Yeah.
Yeah, so check this out.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.289
Grace and I are getting coffee at
Ronnie's this morning, and we walk in.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.846
And who do we see sitting
there alone at a table?

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.291
Marcus.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.878
How's he doing?
Oh!

01:30:59.879 --> 01:31:01.923
He looks great.
He's so good.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:02.802
Buttoned-up shirt.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.763
He's sippin' on a cappuccino.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.289
Marcus drinks cappuccino?
Yeah.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.288
Apparently.
Yeah, I guess so.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.851
Apparently
now he does.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.243
So we're talking
to him and we're catching up.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.943
And he's telling us about
his new job at the

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.511
aquarium and how much
he takes home in tips.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.922
And now he's going to start
applying for classes next semester.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.849
Oh my god!
Yeah.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.247
And it's weird because I'm like,
I have not heard Marcus

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.601
talk this much ever,
since I met him.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.642
Like, what is the deal?
Is he excited to see us?

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.807
Is he nervous about something?

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.521
And that's when I notice there's
another cappuccino on

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.041
the table and an empty
chair next to him.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.768
And then just like in the
fucking movies, bathroom door

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:45.204
