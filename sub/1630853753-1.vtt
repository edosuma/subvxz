Really glad you could come

on such short notice,
by the way.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.370
-No problem.
I'm excited to see it.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.024
-Yeah.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.809
So, we don't know how long
she's been exposed

11:19.853 --> 11:21.985
to the outside air--
-Okay.

11:22.029 --> 11:26.294
-But locals found her
about four days ago.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.645
They thought it was recent
'cause it's so well preserved.

Oh, watch your step here.

Oh, I believe
you know Lennard.

Good to see you again.

what an honor it is--

11:41.483 --> 11:43.528
-What is going on with that?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.313
I saw it on the way in.

11:45.356 --> 11:48.229
[Sonja] Unfortunately, they
found the man who was digging

11:48.272 --> 11:50.535
in his own pit this morning.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.015
-Dead?
-[Sonja] Hm-mm.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.539
Yeah, they say he died
of hypothermia.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.629
A heart attack,
resulting from hypothermia.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.935
[Jonas]
That's terrible.

11:58.979 --> 12:02.199
And the pit?

12:02.243 --> 12:04.419
-Well, we're not allowed
to check it out yet.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.943
-Oh, of course.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.947
-Shall we?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.906
So, we've tried to protect
the site from the elements

12:12.949 --> 12:14.995
as well as we could.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.300
I hope it's satisfactory.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.520
-Yeah, okay.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.565
Okay.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.995
-We had someone walking around
the house

15:53.039 --> 15:55.215
this morning.
-One of ours?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.790
-What he's trying to say is that

16:05.834 --> 16:08.663
[clears throat] the next time
something like this happens,

16:08.706 --> 16:12.188
this person will probably not
receive a very warm welcome.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.366
-Ah, okay.
So that's what he's saying?

16:17.150 --> 16:19.195
-Something like that.

16:21.719 --> 16:22.982
-Mooi.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.203
[Jonas] So...listen.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.205
I'm sorry that this happened.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.120
I will make sure to tell my crew

16:31.164 --> 16:34.384
not to go exploring
on their own. Okay?

16:34.428 --> 16:36.517
-Are you guys
digging for treasure?

16:40.651 --> 16:42.262

19:19.245 --> 19:21.116
[Jonas] Okay.
I have another one.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.813
When, after the plane is landed,

19:22.857 --> 19:24.424
and people jump out
of their seats,

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
grabbing their luggage,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.819
like they're
in a terrible hurry.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.213
But then, of course,
the doors don't open

19:31.257 --> 19:33.041
until 15 minutes later.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.303
And they all stand there,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.131
just cramped together
in the aisle

19:36.175 --> 19:38.089
like a bunch of idiots.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.180
I fucking hate that.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.674
-Nah, we're doing fine.

19:57.718 --> 20:02.288
I could just sit here
and exude authority.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.855
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
-Yeah.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.685
Oh, what about people
who take everything

20:08.729 --> 20:10.513
that's even remotely
considered free?

20:10.557 --> 20:12.211
-Okay.

20:12.254 --> 20:16.215
-You know, like, um...
ah, like those bags of sugar.

20:16.258 --> 20:20.175
They-they don't need them,
but they take them anyway.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.873
-[laughs]
Is this about your mother again?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.832
-Oh, my God.
She is terrible!

20:24.875 --> 20:27.661
She collects those things
like a hamster.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.880
Yeah, and when we have guests,
she presents them

20:29.924 --> 20:32.231
with this whole array
of sugar bags

20:32.274 --> 20:33.884
which she stole.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.669
-[laughs]

20:35.712 --> 20:36.974
Wow.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.629
-Yeah, she gets under my skin.
-Uh-huh.

20:42.458 --> 20:47.376
-As your local guide,
I would advise you to try the...

20:47.420 --> 20:51.380
Witte Koppenjenever next.
It's absolutely delicious.

20:51.424 --> 20:54.296
-Oh, um, I'm pretty sure
I had several of those already

20:54.340 --> 20:58.822
and I'm not sure that I can
sit here and exude authority...

21:02.435 --> 21:05.829
I think I'm getting
a bit too relaxed...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.051

their socks on in bed.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.575

Bloody philistines.

You know what?
I think I have to call it a day.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.768
-Don't fight it.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.207
Lovely.

21:37.557 --> 21:41.256
Yeah, we would just drive
and play gigs everywhere.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.521
Sometimes for like five people,
but that was fine too, you know?

21:46.653 --> 21:48.785
[Jonas] Does your daughter
remember it?

21:49.612 --> 21:53.094
[Betriek]
No, but she likes his voice.

21:55.009 --> 21:57.794
I played her some songs
of us in the car.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.362
He had a very beautiful
singing voice.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.191
So does she, actually.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.890
-No chest pains,
no fatigue, no nothing?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.152
-No.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.633
-His heart just said fuck it.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.419
No more oxygen for this asshole.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.987
[inhales deeply]

22:17.031 --> 22:18.728
How's the head?

22:20.164 --> 22:22.645
-Trying to avoid
sudden movements.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.387
[laughs]

22:25.431 --> 22:28.651
You know, I am usually better
at handling hard liquor.

22:28.695 --> 22:29.826
-[Betriek] Yeah.
-I'm Danish and all.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.654
-Of course.
Of course.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.354
-[laughs]

22:38.574 --> 22:42.056
There must be like
a million guys out there

waiting for a chance
to make you happy.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.190
-[laughs]

22:46.234 --> 22:48.497
Well, I'm sorry to inform you
that I'm not really considered

22:48.541 --> 22:50.020
relationship material
around here.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.152
-Come on.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.632
-No, seriously.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.330
They're all afraid.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.072
Family curse.

-[scoffs] Family curse?
-Yeah.

-'Cause your husband died?

23:03.207 --> 23:07.168
-Yeah, that...
and some other stuff.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.170
It's a boring story.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.389
-Nutshell.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.700
-Well, my grandmother
was murdered when I was a kid

23:17.744 --> 23:19.310
and they never found out
who did it.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.703
[Jonas] Wow.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.792
-My dad went a bit crazy
after that,

23:22.836 --> 23:24.925
started drinking, lost his job.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.536
My mum became
emotionally unavailable.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.540
And nowadays, she's suffering
from this mysterious illness

23:31.584 --> 23:33.803
nobody really seems to know
how to deal with.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.242
I escaped it all for a while
when I went to New York.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.201
But then Neil died,

23:40.244 --> 23:43.073
leaving me with this little
firecracker called Hanna.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.164
-Jesus.

23:47.208 --> 23:50.341
That sounds
like a...a proper curse.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.346
-Yeah. Doesn't it?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.134
-This is me.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.010
Well, thank you
for telling me all of this

24:07.054 --> 24:09.012
before we spend
a whole evening together.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.798
-[chuckles] Well, usually,
it takes a little bit longer

24:11.841 --> 24:16.106
for disaster to strike, so...
I'll stay out of your way.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.108

[Jonas] No.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.192

54:59.121 --> 55:02.473
-Here it is.
The legend of Feike.

55:04.170 --> 55:07.434
Many centuries ago,
there was an evil lord, Walter,

55:07.478 --> 55:09.349
and his bitter wife, Helen,

55:09.393 --> 55:13.048
who treated their people poorly
and lived in tremendous wealth

55:13.092 --> 55:16.182
whilst others
were left to struggle.

55:16.878 --> 55:18.750
Together, they commanded
a household

55:18.793 --> 55:21.230
with dozens of servants.

55:21.274 --> 55:24.059
One of them was a young girl
called Feike.

55:25.583 --> 55:28.237
[applause]

55:41.207 --> 55:44.297
[♪♪]

55:48.954 --> 55:51.565
[Sonja] It wasn't long before
Walter started developing

55:51.609 --> 55:53.480
lustful feelings for the girl.

55:57.484 --> 55:59.791
Eventually, the worst happened.

56:00.792 --> 56:02.576
Feike got pregnant.

56:03.882 --> 56:06.972
[♪♪]

56:21.203 --> 56:23.292
[child screams]

56:23.336 --> 56:25.033
[Sonja]
When Helen found out,

56:25.077 --> 56:27.079
there was no shelter
from her fury.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.430
"It wasn't him!" she screamed.

56:30.474 --> 56:34.739
"He was under a spell,
taken over by her heathen mind."

56:36.915 --> 56:39.961
And so Feike was named
a sorceress.

56:41.093 --> 56:42.964
A witch.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.271
Awaiting her fate
in the dungeon,

56:45.314 --> 56:47.142
she prayed to God for help.

56:47.186 --> 56:48.883
-[Feike chanting prayers]

56:48.927 --> 56:51.538
[Sonja] But it was
a different god who listened,

56:51.582 --> 56:54.411
a heathen god, Moloch.

56:55.368 --> 56:58.937
The god of child sacrifice.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.419
"I will help you escape a fate
unworthy of a soul

57:02.462 --> 57:05.334
so beautiful, my child,"
the god whispered.

57:06.292 --> 57:10.122
"But beware, this vengeance
will become a cage of its own

57:10.165 --> 57:13.560
and I will claim what's mine --

57:13.604 --> 57:17.477
your offspring,
even those yet unborn."

57:19.305 --> 57:22.003
And thus, a deal was made
and sealed

57:22.047 --> 57:26.747
with the mark of Moloch burned
into the girl's forehead.

57:27.748 --> 57:32.144
The next day,
Feike stood at the stake.

57:32.187 --> 57:35.495
"Repent!"
the mistress shrieked.

57:35.539 --> 57:38.280
"Confess your guilt
and repent," she insisted.

57:38.324 --> 57:40.805
"Repent!" she repeated
for the third time.

57:42.154 --> 57:45.244
[♪♪]

57:51.511 --> 57:54.949
But Feike courageously
answered, "No.

57:54.993 --> 57:57.604
It is you who shall repent."

57:57.648 --> 58:00.868
She freed her hand, and before
anyone could act...

58:00.912 --> 58:02.566
[audience gasps]

58:02.609 --> 58:04.611
[Sonja]
...she cut her own throat.

58:11.183 --> 58:14.316
As Feike's last breath
left her body,

58:14.360 --> 58:17.406
Helen's wretched soul
was evicted from hers.

58:22.411 --> 58:24.370
From that moment on,

58:24.413 --> 58:29.201
Helen's living and breathing
flesh would belong to Feike.

58:31.029 --> 58:32.465
As the lord's wife,

58:32.509 --> 58:36.164
she exercised her influence
over his rulings.

58:36.208 --> 58:39.994
Before long, happiness
and prosperity had returned.

58:40.038 --> 58:42.344
To this day,
Feike is celebrated

58:42.388 --> 58:44.738
as a true heroine
and a beacon of light.

58:48.481 --> 58:50.352

I'm only in Holland for a day,
so...

Yeah, it's been crazy.

-What is it?

-It's the guesthouse.

1:28:54.024 --> 1:28:55.721

so...

it's not getting much use.

I can imagine the both of you
could use some time

Uh...maybe record
an album or two.

1:29:17.221 --> 1:29:18.309
Thank you.

-Yeah.

1:29:27.405 --> 1:29:31.366
I think it's best to have
some stability now, you know?

1:29:31.409 --> 1:29:33.672
Stick to the familiar
with Hanna.

1:29:33.716 --> 1:29:36.327
-Yeah, yeah.
Of course. I understand.

are coping so well.

1:29:48.861 --> 1:29:50.254
-Yeah.

1:29:50.297 --> 1:29:54.345
You probably should talk
to someone as well.

1:29:54.389 --> 1:29:56.086
I mean, professional.

1:29:56.129 --> 1:30:01.221
-Well, I have my mantra,
and it seems to work.

I don't know how to translate.

1:30:05.138 --> 1:30:07.227
It's, uh, something like...

1:30:08.185 --> 1:30:09.752
..."Just keep going."

a good mantra.

-Yeah, works for me.

1:30:23.243 --> 1:30:24.462
What's yours?

1:30:25.637 --> 1:30:27.247
-Uh, I don't know.

1:30:30.207 --> 1:30:33.819
I'm having trouble focusing
lately, if I'm being honest.

1:30:33.863 --> 1:30:35.560
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1:30:35.604 --> 1:30:41.261

a lecture for me in Paris, so...

1:30:41.305 --> 1:30:43.525

Yeah.

If you reconsider,
please call me, huh?

1:31:12.467 --> 1:31:14.817
I think it would be good
for the both of you.

1:31:14.860 --> 1:31:17.297

the company.

-We'll be fine.
