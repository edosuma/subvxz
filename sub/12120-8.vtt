WEBVTT

00:51.880 --> 00:54.340
We'll play in here, Frankie, OK?

00:54.430 --> 00:56.640
I'll be there in a second, Grace.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.430
Bud, I can't talk right now.

00:58.510 --> 01:02.140
Uh, I understand you want to vent
about your father, but I'm not your man.

01:02.220 --> 01:03.680
Call Aunt Irma.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.940
Grace! Grace, I got a package.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.820
It might be a gift. It's really heavy.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.030
It could be cheese. It could be cheese!

01:16.110 --> 01:17.910
I don't think we have room
for any more cheese.

01:17.990 --> 01:21.120
-I will make room for cheese.
-I'm putting that on your tombstone.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.080
Oh.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.870
And don't try to make a wig
out of that stuff,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.370
'cause I'm not gonna wear it.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.080
I'm not even be insulted by that.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.000
Oh, sweet Saint Gary.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.300
-The prototypes for my lube!
-Let me see.

01:33.710 --> 01:38.010
Brianna needs my input on packaging,
bottling, marketing, packaging.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.430
-You said packaging.
-Oh, packaging too.

01:40.510 --> 01:44.680
Oh, this is a big moment
in the history of the vagina.

01:44.770 --> 01:48.060
And the dry silent majority everywhere.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.650
Oh, I can't even remember
the last time I was this excited.

01:51.730 --> 01:54.440
Oh, that's not true,
I've been this excited a lot.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.570
But I am really excited.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.950
They're gonna put me on the cover
of <i> Lube Magazine!</i>

02:01.030 --> 02:02.660
That's not a thing.

02:02.740 --> 02:06.040
So, you want to know which one I'd pick?

02:06.120 --> 02:07.670
Nah.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.500
I'm just kidding. Which one?

02:10.539 --> 02:12.050
This one.

02:13.710 --> 02:17.220
Nah. It's so much fun.

02:20.430 --> 02:24.810
Frankie, you want every aspect of
your packaging to tell the narrative.

02:24.890 --> 02:28.140
You know,
you have to establish a memorable visual.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.480
Huh?

02:30.810 --> 02:35.400
Oh, my God. Shut up.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.530
You shut up.

02:36.610 --> 02:38.280
No, look.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.160
Farther.

02:41.910 --> 02:42.910
Farther.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.790
I think
we may have to let this one go, pal.

02:46.870 --> 02:49.420
It's a text from Phil.
He wants to have lunch with me tomorrow.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.420
Oh, that's exciting.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.960
Lunch with the Phil
I-Forget-His-Last-Name,

02:54.050 --> 02:56.170
-Alexopoulos?
-You remembered.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.590
Where's lunch? Someplace romantic?

02:58.670 --> 03:02.010
In a way.
We're meeting at The Anchor Bar.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.470
It's where I... It's where we...

03:05.470 --> 03:08.480
Oh, wait! Don't walk away
in the middle of the story.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.350
What did you do? Kiss?
Grope? Fondle? What?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.980
It's where I first knew
that he felt what I felt.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.450
Oh. Well, tell me anyway.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.200
Well...

03:26.290 --> 03:30.160
when Robert and Sol would be away
on their gay sex business trips...

03:30.250 --> 03:33.210
-Mm.
-...I didn't like the idea of coming back

03:33.290 --> 03:35.420
to an empty house after work.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.880
So I would treat myself to a drink or two,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.300
or one time, four,

03:42.380 --> 03:44.640
at The Anchor
across the street from the office.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.430
You know, it's been there for ages.

03:46.510 --> 03:47.970
Yeah, it and me both.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.430
No, no, it gets better.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.560
One night, it was about, um,

03:52.650 --> 03:55.900
three months after Phil
stopped working on our house,

03:55.980 --> 03:58.690
and I walked in and there he was.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.490
Just by chance.

04:01.570 --> 04:05.280
He bought me a drink and we talked.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.370
And we laughed.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.830
We really laughed.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.830
And at the end of the night,
he put his hand on my back...

04:15.840 --> 04:17.459
and I felt something

04:17.540 --> 04:22.930
that I had never felt
in 40 years with Robert.

04:24.590 --> 04:25.930
Mm.

04:26.010 --> 04:29.850
Oh, sister, you said the story
would get better and damn it, it did.

04:29.930 --> 04:33.020
So I started seeing him
when Robert was away.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.560
And sometimes when he wasn't away.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.610
All those years, I thought
you were stuck-up and boring as shit.

04:39.690 --> 04:44.360
But it turns out you were stuck-up
and interesting as shit.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.910
Thanks.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.540
-OK.
-Mm.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.960
I don't know how to play chess.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.660
- This is not my lube!
<i>-  Excuse me?</i>

05:33.750 --> 05:37.290
Mr. Brajaja-hadad,
I'm going to call you right back.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.500
His name is Craig, he said call him Craig,

05:39.590 --> 05:40.880
you should probably just call him Craig.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.460
Not my lube. Not my lube.

05:43.550 --> 05:46.800
-Frankie. Hello.
-Oh, don't try to sweet-talk me,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.760
Miss Peed-in-her-pants-
at-her-tenth-birthday-party.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.470
I had a medical condition. That's--

05:51.560 --> 05:55.020
This is not my recipe.
And yes, my vagina can tell.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.520
OK. Adam, can you please give us a second?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.270
-Oh, absolutely not. No.
-What are you doing?

05:59.350 --> 06:01.480
Oh, I have a few friends
that don't believe Frankie's real.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.570
So, just go on.

06:04.150 --> 06:07.700
-It's not my recipe.
-Look, we need--

06:07.780 --> 06:11.200
We needed to add a few ingredients
for mass production.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.700
Didn't you read the packet I gave you
along with those samples?

06:13.790 --> 06:17.460
Of course. I skimmed them. Parts of them.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.130
-No. What?
-It's nothing.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.920
It's a little citrus seed, some palm oil--

06:22.000 --> 06:24.130
Palm oil? Are you insane?

06:24.210 --> 06:25.800
Palm oil?

06:25.880 --> 06:28.880
Palm oil extraction
destroys the rain forest.

06:28.970 --> 06:31.010
And do you know who lives
in the rain forest?

06:31.100 --> 06:33.470
Oh, I don't know. Only our cousins.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.230
-The Fleigelmans?
-The orangutans!

06:37.310 --> 06:39.520
Oh, damn it! "Storage space full."

06:39.600 --> 06:41.730
Do you want us to wait
while you delete some pictures?

06:41.810 --> 06:44.650
-Would you?
-What is this face telling you?

06:45.650 --> 06:46.860
Bye.

06:47.950 --> 06:51.740
OK. Frankie, I can tell you're very upset.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.290
So, let's just take a breath.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.660
Let's sit down. Let's talk about this.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.170
Great.

07:01.130 --> 07:06.340
Now you want your lube in every
grocery store in America, right?

07:06.420 --> 07:09.010
And some of the more
progressive car washes, yes.

07:09.970 --> 07:10.840
OK.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.760
Well, products like this can end up
sitting on a shelf for a year.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.100
And they need a little help
to keep from spoiling.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.230
Do you know how fast yams go bad?

07:19.310 --> 07:22.940
-Yes, six months.
-No.

07:23.690 --> 07:24.690
Then, no.

07:26.150 --> 07:29.530
Do you want to explain
to the Good Stuff people

07:29.610 --> 07:33.070
why your lube has a shelf life
of three to five weeks?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.200
In a darkened room?

07:34.280 --> 07:37.040
My lube is gonna be
in the Good Stuff stores?

07:37.120 --> 07:39.710
That's the plan. Also in the packet.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.500
-I read the packet.
-You just admitted you didn't.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.340
-Well, then why keep bringing it up?
-Oh, to shame you.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.090
I can't be a party to palm oil!

07:50.380 --> 07:52.050
Is it in all your products?

07:52.130 --> 07:55.550
No... palm oil is in every product.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.520
It's in the shampoo you use, it's in
the Cheez-Its you're never not eating.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.100
I bet I could open up your purse right now

08:00.180 --> 08:01.940
and find three things
that have palm oil in them.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.690
The joke's on you. I can't find my purse.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.650
The joke is absolutely on me.

08:07.730 --> 08:11.950
Frankie,
even if I wanted to get rid of palm oil,

08:12.030 --> 08:14.990
which I totally do, I do...

08:15.070 --> 08:19.250
this is how we've always done things,
since before I worked here.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.210
-This is Grace's doing?
-That's not what I meant.

08:22.290 --> 08:26.420
It makes so much sense. The enemy's
been right under my nose the whole time.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.710
What? No. No.
I'm not saying that it's her fault.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.590
What I'm saying
is that palm oil is ubiquitous.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.549
Don't you try to hypnotize me
with your corporate power jargon.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.890
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
Frankie Bergstein, out.

08:46.190 --> 08:49.360
Well, that was fucking art.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.700
This is really great, isn't it?

08:56.910 --> 09:00.620
Way better than my
beige-on-beige-on-beige hotel room.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.620
I loved doing this
when you boys were little.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.500
You mean the four nights a year
when you and Mom

09:06.580 --> 09:09.040
would let us run the AC
and we'd all sleep huddled around it?

09:09.130 --> 09:11.670
Yeah, we'd play Bergstein Foot Jenga.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.760
And tell Jewish ghost stories.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.720
Is that what got you into Kabbalah?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.680
That was college. I was trying things.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.520
It was a girl. It was Mom.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.940
You know who'd hate this right now?
Robert.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.200
So...

09:40.200 --> 09:42.450
What's the plan for getting him back?

09:42.540 --> 09:45.080
Well, I'm giving him some time.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.000
Which is a non-plan.

09:47.080 --> 09:52.000
But I know he won't have the answer
I'm hoping for right now, so...

09:52.090 --> 09:55.920
maybe if I let him thaw,
he'll be able to hear me.

09:56.010 --> 09:58.180
-Good plan.
-Nah, I don't see it.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.590
No, no, no, Dad's right.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.560
You can't talk rationally to Robert
when he's angry.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.100
Which is why I've been working
from my neutral-toned hotel room.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.150
He's angry even though
you're not at the office.

10:08.230 --> 10:11.650
We all hide until he calms down
or until he eats a tea bag,

10:11.730 --> 10:14.280
which, by the way,
he's been doing a lot these days.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.110
Grace was very clear
I should leave him alone.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.200
Yeah, the problem is Grace
still has her dignity and ego intact.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.580
Take it from someone that has neither:

10:23.660 --> 10:27.000
You need to show Robert your heart.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.000
That way he knows exactly what to stomp on
before he takes you back.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.170
I don't know.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.340
No, believe me, Dad. It works.
It's how I got Bud back.

10:36.420 --> 10:39.550
Uh, full disclosure,
I'm still not totally back.

10:39.630 --> 10:45.180
He needs to know that you love him
and you're not giving up.

10:45.970 --> 10:47.930
I'm not giving up.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.320
<i> You have 12 new messages.</i>

11:00.410 --> 11:04.240
<i> Hello, Robert. It's me.</i>

11:05.450 --> 11:07.330
<i>Wait, no.</i>

11:07.410 --> 11:10.830
<i>It's not "me." I mean, it is me,</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:14.630
<i>but I guess I don't have the right</i>
<i>to say "it's me" anymore.</i>

11:15.800 --> 11:18.420
<i>I'm no longer your "it's me."</i>

11:20.130 --> 11:21.260
<i>So, anyway...</i>

11:22.220 --> 11:23.510
<i>it's Sol...</i>

11:25.430 --> 11:27.100
<i>Bergstein.</i>

11:36.020 --> 11:37.360
<i>J'accuse!</i>

11:39.690 --> 11:40.740
Which means--

11:40.820 --> 11:43.780
I know what it means.
It means you got too stoned again

11:43.870 --> 11:46.120
and tried to even out
drinking too much coffee.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.500
Green tea, but this isn't about that.

11:48.580 --> 11:51.710
I know it was all you, Grace.
Oh, yes. I talked to Brianna.

11:51.790 --> 11:55.670
-I know all about the palm oil.
-Oh. You do, do you?

11:55.750 --> 11:58.380
I know it's in
all of Say Grace's products.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.010
I thought this might come up.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.470
Do you know what used to be
in all of Say Grace's products?

12:02.550 --> 12:06.310
-Parabens.
-Ha, parabens, even worse.

12:06.390 --> 12:09.770
I should do my one-woman show
on parabens for you some time,

12:09.850 --> 12:11.770
"Para-Been To Hell And Back."

12:11.850 --> 12:14.520
You have. Twice. Two times.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.690
Don't change the subject, Grace.

12:16.770 --> 12:20.440
I didn't. Look, just so you know,

12:20.530 --> 12:24.030
we thought palm oil would be
a better alternative for women's health.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.950
It wasn't until just a few years ago

12:26.030 --> 12:28.080
we knew how terrible it was
for the environment.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.910
I've known forever.
What would Frances Mengela say?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.170
She wouldn't even recognize me.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.960
She used to bare her breasts at
the Republican National Convention,

12:38.040 --> 12:41.970
she would throw stink bombs at
the Republican National Convention.

12:42.050 --> 12:47.100
And now I've turned into a--
an orangutan-genocide profiteer.

12:48.390 --> 12:51.180
No, you mean a profiteer
of orangutan genocide.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.480
'Cause the way you said it, it sounds like
you're a morally bankrupt orangutan.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.110
Not the time, Grace.
I can't lube a vagina with one hand

12:58.190 --> 13:00.480
and smack an orangutan with the other.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.030
As an outside contractor,
you don't have a say in this.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.740
But what you can do
is make a passionate argument.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.580
And if you make a compelling enough case,
they might listen to you.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.960
You think a song would work?
'Cause I think I've got one.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.040
<i>♪ Blood on your hands</i>
<i>Blood on your hands ♪</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:19.130
<i>♪ Blood on my hands ♪</i>

13:19.210 --> 13:20.840

<i>What have you done? ♪</i>

<i>Blood on my hands ♪</i>

13:22.960 --> 13:25.130
Oh, yeah, exactly.
No, I--

13:25.220 --> 13:27.050
I think you've got this covered.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.850
Uh, w-wait. Grace?

13:44.150 --> 13:49.160
Hey. Morning. Did you hear
those crows? They were all like...

13:51.280 --> 13:53.290
That's not right. No, it was more like...

13:54.750 --> 13:56.500
Damn it.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.710
What are you doing? Being weird?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.290
It's soothing.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.550
I needed something to do
before I see Phil.

14:03.630 --> 14:07.800
I was gonna clean your hairbrush,
but I thought it would take too long.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.850
-You guys having breakfast?
-Lunch.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.890
Well, you look fantastic.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.350
Even if there's Mumbai-scale traffic,

14:16.440 --> 14:18.440
you've still got three hours
to get there.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.230
What if I'm not the person
he thought I was?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.900
You know,
what if we finally start this

14:23.980 --> 14:27.900
and he finds he doesn't like
who I actually am?

14:27.990 --> 14:30.660
But he does like who you actually are.

14:30.740 --> 14:33.080
Well, he doesn't really know
who I am anymore.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.540
You may not know this, Frankie,
but I'm a flawed person.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.290
I do know that.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.790
You know who else knows it?

14:39.870 --> 14:43.500
My daughters, my grandkids, my friends,

14:43.590 --> 14:46.720
every customer service representative
I ever interacted with.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.550
Aren't you jumping to the end
of the story a little too soon?

14:49.640 --> 14:53.220
I spent 40 years with a man
who didn't love me.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.600
Maybe I'm the problem.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.190
You know, maybe I'm unlovable.

14:59.270 --> 15:02.110
-You're not unlovable.
-Are you sure?

15:02.190 --> 15:05.570
Now you're fishing.
Guess what? You caught one.

15:05.650 --> 15:07.860
I love you. You happy?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.990
-What do I do?
-This is what you do.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.200
You stand up.

15:16.910 --> 15:19.910
You put your damn purse
on your arm the way you like it.

15:25.210 --> 15:28.760
And then you do exactly
what you told me to do with Jacob.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.720
What did I tell you to do with Jacob?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.340
"Don't be an idiot."

15:32.430 --> 15:35.310
-That does sound like me.
-Oh.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.820
Ma'am? Are you sure
I can't get you anything?

15:47.900 --> 15:50.110
No, thank you, Gretchen. I'm fine.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.410
It's just, you've been here a half hour.

15:52.490 --> 15:56.950
Please walk away.
See, it has to look like I just got here.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.330
Off you go. Go.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.540
Is somebody watching us?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.380
If you're in some kind of trouble,

16:03.460 --> 16:06.380
take your spoon and slide it
to the other side of the table.

16:06.460 --> 16:10.970
Look... I got here very early for a date
because I was nervous

16:11.050 --> 16:14.760
and now I don't want
to look desperate or insane.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.470
So please do me a kindness and leave.

16:27.190 --> 16:28.650
Phil.

16:29.690 --> 16:30.990
Phil.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.200
Oh, good Lord.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.070
Phil!

16:40.790 --> 16:43.420
I thought I heard my name
a bunch of times.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.130
-You look lovely.
-Thank you. So do you.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.930
Well, I don't mean lovely.

16:54.010 --> 16:55.890
You know what I mean.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.440
Wow.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.319
Actually, I think that's my water.

17:14.109 --> 17:16.240
I'm... I'm sorry.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.069
It's OK.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.369
Tell you what, we'll just switch.

17:24.579 --> 17:28.130
Where is that waitress?
I keep trying to get her attention.

17:28.210 --> 17:31.050
Um... Oh, there you are.

17:31.130 --> 17:34.420
-Hello, sir. Ma'am.
-Hello.

17:34.510 --> 17:35.970
Welcome to The Anchor.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.260
I'm Gretchen and I will be your server.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.430
Can I get you something to drink?

17:42.520 --> 17:46.060
Let me take a crack at it,
for old time's sake.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.900
Oh, OK. Crack away.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.190
She'll have a vodka martini.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.030
Straight up. Very dry.

17:55.070 --> 17:55.950
Two olives.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.370
And he'll have a rye Manhattan

18:00.450 --> 18:02.950
served up in a rocks glass,

18:03.040 --> 18:06.080
with an orange peel instead of a cherry.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.420
Be right back.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.250
You're doing great.

18:14.380 --> 18:17.840
<i> And when you look at my chart,</i>
<i>not actually my zodiac chart,</i>

18:17.930 --> 18:20.550
<i>but the moon chart</i>
<i>from the year I was born,</i>

18:20.640 --> 18:22.680
<i>and compare that to your chart,</i>

18:22.760 --> 18:26.180
<i>you'll see it was literally written</i>
<i>in the stars for us to have this fight--</i>

18:28.770 --> 18:32.230
<i>Of course, if you did look</i>
<i>at my zodiac chart,</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:35.070
<i>you'd see that I'm cosmically doomed--</i>

18:36.650 --> 18:40.950
<i>I guess I'm saying that it was so hard</i>
<i>for us to get to where we were.</i>

18:41.030 --> 18:42.330
<i>Are we really going to let one--</i>

18:44.490 --> 18:46.710
<i>I believe it was a young Mickey Rourke</i>
<i>who once said--</i>

18:47.790 --> 18:50.580
<i>Actually, "hakuna matata" literally means</i>

18:50.670 --> 18:53.670
<i>"there is no problem here" in Swahili.</i>

18:53.750 --> 18:56.840
<i>I interpret that to mean</i>
<i>"there's no problem that's unsolvable"--</i>

18:58.010 --> 19:01.720
<i> Message skipped.</i>
<i>To delete this message, press one.</i>

19:01.800 --> 19:04.760
<i>To continue listening</i>
<i>to this message, press two.</i>

19:16.440 --> 19:20.110
<i> I'm sorry for the long,</i>
<i>meandering messages.</i>

19:20.200 --> 19:24.990
<i>The truth is, this was all</i>
<i>way too many words just to say...</i>

19:27.910 --> 19:29.660
<i>I miss you like crazy.</i>

19:31.120 --> 19:33.670
<i>My heart hurts not being with you.</i>

19:35.550 --> 19:39.470
<i>You're my person.</i>
<i>I need you.</i>

19:43.140 --> 19:47.390
<i>It's Sol. Sol Bergstein.</i>

19:59.320 --> 20:03.030
<i> Frankie, we have a little saying</i>
<i>here at Good Stuff when we like a product.</i>

20:03.120 --> 20:05.370
-"This is Good Stuff."
<i>-This is good--</i>

20:05.450 --> 20:08.410
<i>-Dan, I was gonna say it.</i>
-Sorry, Ger. Jumped the gun.

20:08.490 --> 20:12.460
Well, gentlemen, it sounds like our lube
is going to be in your stores.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.330
Yeah. And we could not be more thrilled.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.170
I've got to say,
I'm excited to be involved

20:17.250 --> 20:19.010
with such an eco-friendly company.

20:19.090 --> 20:20.800
<i>Well, we really pride ourselves on that.</i>

20:20.880 --> 20:25.180
You should. You are one of the
first companies to ban all those foods

20:25.260 --> 20:27.680
which contain
genetically-modified ingredients.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.600
Oh, you've done your research.

20:29.680 --> 20:34.810
Thank you, Dan. That means so much
coming from a fellow <i> hermano del mundo.</i>

20:37.940 --> 20:40.360
OK. I like you. Huh?

20:40.440 --> 20:45.490
I like you, too. And I'm sure something
like palm oil must really upset you.

20:45.570 --> 20:48.200
Oh, well, of course it upsets me,
but we have to--

20:48.280 --> 20:49.740
You know what, let's just stay focused,

20:49.830 --> 20:52.540
because I know that Stephen and Erica
had some shelf schematics

20:52.620 --> 20:56.210
-they wanted to pitch you guys.
-Yeah, we call them "shelf stories."

20:56.290 --> 20:59.130
Oh, we agreed "no" to "shelf stories."

20:59.210 --> 21:01.420
Yes, and then we agreed
to let me try it.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.630
Would anyone like
some Say Grace hand lotion?

21:04.720 --> 21:08.050
It's so good.
It moisturizes as it protects.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.850
Let's just let Stephen and Erica
do their thing.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.640
Sorry, I'll put it on quietly.

21:13.730 --> 21:17.480
Gerald, if you could just refer
to page five in your packet.

21:17.560 --> 21:21.320
<i>I got nothing here.</i>
<i>Stacey, did I get a packet?</i>

21:22.360 --> 21:25.110
<i>Right. From Say Grace. No?</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:26.410
That's on you.

21:26.490 --> 21:29.660
Ah, I'm so dry. Let's get it all over.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.540
Frankie? What the hell?

21:36.620 --> 21:38.710
-Oh, my God.
-Is that real blood?

21:39.500 --> 21:42.340
Sure is.
It's from the orangutans we kill

21:42.420 --> 21:44.880
so that we can put palm oil
in all our products.

21:44.970 --> 21:49.260
You know, apparently here at Say Grace
we think that's "good stuff."

21:49.350 --> 21:52.850
Oh, I've got so much extra.
Here you go, Dan.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.600
-Oh, no. No! No!
-Dan, it's ketchup.

21:55.690 --> 21:59.060
It's a goof.
It's gonna be funny. Soon.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.570
<i>Dan, I'm in the dark here.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

22:00.650 --> 22:03.530
-Uh, meeting's gone south, Ger.
-I'll go grab some towels.

22:03.610 --> 22:06.740
-Gerry, I'm so sorry.
-No, no, we're gonna change it!

22:06.820 --> 22:09.370
We don't have to have
blood on our hands.

22:09.450 --> 22:11.120
This is a $3,000 suit.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.830
Please take Dan across the street
to get him a sweatshirt

22:12.910 --> 22:14.290
-and to get his suit cleaned.
-Yeah.

22:14.370 --> 22:17.670
Uh, so wait,
just like any sweatshirt, or...

22:17.750 --> 22:20.250
Do you remember that talk we had
about being more of a self-starter?

22:20.330 --> 22:21.880
Today's the day, Stephen.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.630
I don't want a sweatshirt.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.300
Dan, let's go.

22:26.260 --> 22:28.010
Good to meet you, Dan!

22:30.640 --> 22:34.020
-What the fuck?
-I'm effecting change, baby.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.430
And let's be clear,

22:35.520 --> 22:39.020
there is no way in hell that
that is a $3,000 suit.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.020
This is not how you effect change.
This is how you destroy

22:42.110 --> 22:44.650
a business relationship
I've spent years building.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.360
Did you honestly think
you could come in here

22:46.440 --> 22:48.740
with your bloody performance art
and it would work?

22:48.820 --> 22:52.280
Absolutely, yes. That's why I did it.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.990
And I thought Adam would be here
so he could film it.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.120
-Is he sick?
-No, don't sit down!

22:57.210 --> 22:58.710
God damn it, Frankie.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.710
I mean, I only included you
in this process as a favor

23:01.790 --> 23:03.460
because you asked
to be taken seriously.

23:03.540 --> 23:07.800
But in order to be taken seriously,
you have to be serious.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.430
I am very serious.

23:09.510 --> 23:11.550
Well, I'd invite you
to take a look at your hands

23:11.640 --> 23:12.800
and reevaluate that statement.

23:12.890 --> 23:15.180
I'm not gonna stand by
and have my lube--

23:15.270 --> 23:18.140
No, my lube. You signed a contract.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.900
And you've made it perfectly clear
that you don't respect that,

23:20.980 --> 23:23.900
or me, or the business
that my mother built.

23:23.980 --> 23:26.900
And so now I'm telling you
I have received the message.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.690
-Thank you.
-And you're out.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.780
What do you mean out?

23:30.860 --> 23:34.620
I mean out the door,
out of luck, out to lunch.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.120
Just as long as it's out.

23:39.410 --> 23:42.710
Go home, Frankie. And if you haven't
already ruined everything,

23:42.790 --> 23:44.630
maybe you'll get a check
a few times a year.

23:53.010 --> 23:54.180
Out.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.650
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.070
What was your friend's name
we ran into that one time?

24:12.160 --> 24:15.950
Her name was Joan
and she was made of cigarettes.

24:16.030 --> 24:18.660
I thought she'd caught us.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.080
We were holding hands.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.460
Thank God she died
before she spilled the beans.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.130
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:24.210 --> 24:28.250
Kidding. She just moved
to Fort Lauderdale.

24:28.340 --> 24:29.630
She did die, though.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.510
To Joan.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.930
You know why I picked this place?

24:38.970 --> 24:40.890
Yes. Of course.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.690
That was a special night.

24:42.770 --> 24:45.060
Yes, it was.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.810
It was lucky I ran into you.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.320
Well, I may have known this was
your regular Friday night spot,

24:50.400 --> 24:54.160
and I may have come here
intending to run into you.

24:54.240 --> 24:58.490
Well, I maybe made up excuses
to see you, too.

24:58.580 --> 25:02.120
Remember when I hired you
to put in the skylight?

25:02.210 --> 25:05.420
-Yeah.
-I hate skylights.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.810
What?

25:24.690 --> 25:25.850
What is it?

25:47.580 --> 25:50.040
What are you doing here?

25:50.130 --> 25:51.500
I needed to get some things.

25:51.590 --> 25:53.420
You nearly gave me
a second heart attack.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.970
I'm sorry,
I didn't think you'd be home.

25:57.050 --> 26:00.260
I took the day off, if you must know.
Which you mustn't.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.770
You should have told me you were coming
so I could have told you not to.

26:03.850 --> 26:04.850
You shouldn't be here.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.150
What were you gonna do with that?

26:08.810 --> 26:11.150
Bludgeon.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.780
I thought it was a break-in.

26:13.860 --> 26:17.950
I did tell you I was coming.
Didn't you get my messages?

26:18.030 --> 26:21.160
Yes, Sol. I did.
All 18,000 of them.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.910
But since the answering machine
is in the kitchen

26:24.000 --> 26:26.160
and I did have to go to bed
at some point,

26:26.250 --> 26:27.960
I could not listen to all of them.

26:28.040 --> 26:32.880
I'm sorry. You have everything I own.

26:32.960 --> 26:36.720
Except my rain sticks,
which were in my car.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.510
There were actually some extra
rain sticks at the beach house.

26:39.590 --> 26:42.100
Are you deliberately
trying to antagonize me?

26:43.010 --> 26:44.100
No.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.940
No.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.770
I'll be out of your hair
in five minutes.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.730
I just need to get a few--
Whoa.

26:59.030 --> 27:02.990
Yeah. Sorry.

27:06.290 --> 27:08.080
What can I do to help us
get through this?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.580
Tell me what it's going to take,
and I'll do it.

27:10.670 --> 27:11.960
Anything. Name it.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.550
I'm not sure
there's anything you can do.

27:15.460 --> 27:18.170
Are you telling me
you can't get past this?

27:22.510 --> 27:24.010
I don't know.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.810
Do you want to get past it?

27:32.440 --> 27:33.940
I don't know.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.770
What?

28:13.850 --> 28:16.440
-I have to tell you something.
-OK.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.360
-But you need to let me explain.
-OK.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.530
I'm still married to Elaine.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.240
Oh.

28:28.330 --> 28:30.370
This is where
you need to let me explain.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.330
Oh, God, I can't believe
I got it so wrong.

28:34.420 --> 28:37.250
-Grace, just let me--
-No. I have to go.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.470
-Grace!
-Sir, you need to pay your bill.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.970
I haven't brought it yet,
but I was going to.

28:44.050 --> 28:46.180
I will pay my bill. I just need to--

28:50.480 --> 28:52.270
Fuck.

28:57.690 --> 28:59.650
Hey.

28:59.730 --> 29:00.860
Hey.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.660
How was Phil?

29:03.740 --> 29:05.070
I don't want to talk about it.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.910
I don't want to talk about my day,
either.

29:07.990 --> 29:10.660
Well, I think the person
with blood all over their arms

29:10.740 --> 29:12.580
is gonna have to say something.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.750
Brianna fired me.
From my own lube.

29:16.830 --> 29:19.380
-I'm out.
-What happened?

29:19.460 --> 29:21.380
Art happened.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.470
-Oh, dear.
-Performance art.

29:24.550 --> 29:28.220
All over her office and this guy, Dan.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.140
I'm not sure it was the best way
to get what I wanted.

29:31.220 --> 29:33.930
Mostly because I didn't get what I wanted.

29:35.770 --> 29:39.650
You know, the lube was one of
the coolest things I've ever created.

29:39.730 --> 29:42.820
Oh... and I fucked it all up.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.410
Frankie, in business,
when you want to change people's minds,

29:46.490 --> 29:49.330
you have to do it
the way businesspeople do it.

29:49.410 --> 29:51.700
You think I should have worn a suit?

29:51.790 --> 29:56.370
No, you... you do some research,
you commission a study, talk to experts.

29:56.460 --> 29:58.710
And mostly, you show them
how it can make them money.

29:58.790 --> 30:01.460
Jesus, you're good at this.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.380
Well, I used to be.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.890
Oh, there's my order from China Bucket.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.930
Uh, Grace?

30:21.730 --> 30:23.820
You didn't let me finish.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.950
He's way more handsome up close.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.830
Thanks for letting me in.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.090
Well, you got about five minutes
before <i> Jeopardy</i> comes on

30:42.170 --> 30:45.170
and Frankie starts yelling
wrong answers to the screen.

30:47.010 --> 30:50.890
My situation is... complicated.

30:50.970 --> 30:53.010
So enlighten me.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.140
After that night
we were supposed to meet in the hotel,

30:58.230 --> 31:00.020
I told Elaine everything.

31:02.570 --> 31:06.440
Even though I knew
it was over for you and me.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.660
We decided to get divorced.
I even got an apartment.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.910
Then she got sick.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.700
And I just couldn't leave her.

31:20.580 --> 31:23.420
Elaine has Alzheimer's.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.420
Advanced now.

31:28.510 --> 31:30.380
God, Phil. I'm s--

31:30.470 --> 31:34.310
So, yes... I am married.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.100
But the Elaine I knew is gone.

31:39.770 --> 31:43.270
She hasn't been that Elaine
for a very long time.

31:45.110 --> 31:46.820
I'm so sorry.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.950
I can't imagine.

31:51.860 --> 31:54.370
Why didn't you tell me this before?

31:54.450 --> 31:56.910
I don't know. Really.

31:57.790 --> 32:01.290
That day you came to my house,
seeing you...

32:02.460 --> 32:05.170
I just wanted everything
to be like it was again.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.760
Even if it was just for a drink.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.760
I thought that would be enough.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.430
It's not.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.020
So...

32:25.610 --> 32:26.820
what now?

32:28.530 --> 32:30.030
That's up to you.

32:34.990 --> 32:37.450
What is Machu Picchu?

32:38.620 --> 32:40.330
Oh, shit!
