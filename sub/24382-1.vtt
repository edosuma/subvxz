It's okay. I could use
a research assistant.

That analyzes soil samples

in the ground that might be
poisoning the animals.

and she was down.

- Ash.

03:54.307 --> 03:55.675
She's breathing steady now.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.913
From what you said on the phone,
I'd say this is hypercapnia.

Well, I've got family

Back in the '80s,
thousands of villagers

08:38.561 --> 08:40.196
near Lake Nyos were asphyxiated,

08:40.596 --> 08:41.697
just like Barnes's sheep.

08:42.432 --> 08:43.866
It was carbon dioxide, it...

08:44.133 --> 08:46.166
hovers off the ground no more
than three or four feet,

08:46.168 --> 08:48.804
which is why
Ashley was affected, but not us.

08:49.538 --> 08:50.407
What's causing it?

08:53.175 --> 08:55.978
Lake Nyos is in the crater
of a dormant volcano.

08:56.213 --> 08:58.315
- We don't have a volcano.
- DAVIS: That's not true.

08:58.948 --> 09:00.816
Yellowstone is 90 miles
from here.

09:01.650 --> 09:02.852
All those hot springs?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.855
I mean, that place
is one giant volcano.

You think Yellowstone's
a threat? Now?

to piece together

09:11.560 --> 09:13.061

to Ashley, the sheep,

09:13.063 --> 09:14.264

How does a tsunami
have anything to do

09:16.899 --> 09:18.567
with a volcano and dead sheep?

09:20.836 --> 09:24.506
The news report... that was on
before the TV went out.

09:24.508 --> 09:27.110
It said that there was
a massive underwater earthquake,

09:27.411 --> 09:29.112
which would explain the tsunami.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.047
The weight of that much water
shifting on tectonic plates

09:32.049 --> 09:34.349
could strain Yellowstone
to the breaking point.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.251
Okay, but you don't know this
for sure.

Even if it's not
a full-blown eruption,

If the wind's blowing
in the wrong direction,
