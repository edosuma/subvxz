WEBVTT

00:12.721 --> 00:15.890
-We had this conversation.
-Why are you speaking--

00:23.898 --> 00:25.316
You're the one saying--

00:30.655 --> 00:34.701


00:34.784 --> 00:36.161
Oh!

00:39.873 --> 00:42.250
Who was yelling?
What was the beef?

00:42.333 --> 00:46.796
It was just Mia screaming, saying how
other people weren't giving content

00:46.880 --> 00:49.716
because they were in their trailers,
and she pointed at Larray,

00:49.799 --> 00:51.801
Larray got mad and they started screaming.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.512
Because we went in the trailers?

00:55.680 --> 00:59.392
-I'm watching <i>Ratatouille</i>.
-'Cause we're not filming enough content.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.686
What content does she want us to film?

01:04.981 --> 01:06.983
We just have very different energy.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.319
It's like having fun.
They're more like parents.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.031
We're still so young,
and, like, we're in this life

01:13.114 --> 01:18.745
and we're making money that a 21-year-old,
or whatever age, should not be making.

01:18.828 --> 01:23.708
I found you… in your trailer…
watching <i>Ratatouille!</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:26.419
-Eating pizza.
-Eating pizza!

01:26.503 --> 01:28.129
-That's the thing…

01:28.213 --> 01:29.672
…we're so consistent.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.009
They know what they're gonna get
out of us three.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.726
What's wrong?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.396
I'm overworked…

01:46.356 --> 01:47.565
and I'm tired…

01:48.233 --> 01:51.945
and I don't have anything
that makes me happy besides you.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.490


01:55.573 --> 01:57.283
All I do is help people.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.329
I'm just such a giver.
I've done it since I was a kid.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.957
I did it with my mom,
I did it with my dad,

02:04.040 --> 02:06.251
I did it with my siblings
and my grandparents.

02:07.252 --> 02:13.133
The arguing, the fighting, the yelling,
it brought me back to when I was young

02:13.216 --> 02:16.761
and I try my hardest
to not think about those things.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.057
I've also spent my life
trying to get somewhere

02:21.141 --> 02:25.228
and now that I'm here
I'm trying to protect it at all costs.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.814
I don't wanna go back
to where I came from.

02:28.731 --> 02:33.069
I think the biggest struggle
I went through growing up was abandonment

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
and that was from everyone around me.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.576
When my parents got divorced
I was maybe five or six.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.744
Their marriage didn't end well.

02:41.828 --> 02:46.207
And then my mom spent more time
with this guy than she did with us

02:46.291 --> 02:49.919
and my dad was focused
on his wife and his new kid

02:50.003 --> 02:51.337
and I got kicked out.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.549
So I lived with my cousin.
I lived in the living room.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.551
I felt very alone my whole life

02:56.634 --> 03:00.430
and I never felt like
I had anyone there for me.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.432
I felt like
I had to be there for everyone.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.894
You do whatever you can
for people and you keep giving

03:08.354 --> 03:10.190
No one helps you.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.610
I think,
because of the way I grew up,

03:13.693 --> 03:17.363
it hurts when I feel the same thing
from the people around me.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.158
I've been through a lot.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.161
I've pushed it off
instead of addressing it

03:23.244 --> 03:25.955
'cause I said I was gonna
deal with it when I'm successful.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.627
And now that I'm successful,
I am just stuck.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.256
I don't know what to do anymore,
because you're gonna have more breakdowns.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.967
It's just only gonna get worse.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.553
I give you advice and stuff but,

03:41.512 --> 03:45.600
it can only go so far
until you actually want to help yourself.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.604
-Is Tom okay?
-Who are you talking about?

03:49.687 --> 03:51.898
Thomas started crying
and went that way.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.152
Thomas has built something amazing
and brought so many people up with it.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.657
It's sad he doesn't get the friendship
and recognition he deserves. Genuinely.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.868
He's treated everyone like family
and he's confused.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.789
He's confused why people
don't treat him the way he treats them.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.873
He's over there.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.754
Should we go out there
and join the screams?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.422
I wanna know what happened.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.392
What's going on?

04:28.768 --> 04:31.604
I'm just tired, dude.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.439
I've never seen Thomas like that.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.655
That kid kicked me-- Didn't let me move
into the house but it doesn't matter,

04:40.738 --> 04:44.409
if I see anyone down, I'll approach them
and tell them what's good.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.703
I'll never bring anything bad
up against them.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.205
You're carrying
a lot of weight on your shoulders.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.040
Like, I try so hard.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.793
But it's killing me.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.838
Thomas, you just need to chill, bro.

04:57.547 --> 05:01.509
The way that he started to try
and make people succeed was healthy

05:01.592 --> 05:04.721
and we wanted to get there together
and now you feel pressured

05:08.057 --> 05:12.729
I feel like everyone's in this industry
because they weren't good with authority,

05:12.812 --> 05:16.607
that's why they didn't go the school route
and wanted to be their own bosses.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.694
I shut down, a lot of us do,
when you have pressure.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.279
But he is a hustler.

05:21.362 --> 05:25.283
I hate him for that fact,
but I respect him for that fact too.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.204
And regardless of what I've said
and any way I've felt,

05:30.288 --> 05:34.250
I always know deep down that you always
just want the best for people.

05:38.338 --> 05:43.801
When I went off on Mia, that was very
out of pocket, drunk-- Horrible situation.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.844
So out of pocket.

05:44.927 --> 05:49.140
No matter what we've had,
I care about you, I want you to do well.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.476
I want all you guys to do well, like--

05:51.559 --> 05:54.896
All of the people
that you brought in have done well.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.690
Chase is something
I never thought he could get to.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.275
I'm proud of that kid.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.029
Look at Larray,
Charli, Dixie, Addison, Avani.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.658
I just wish that they… ever talked to me.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.967
I'm just so scared of…
having to go back where I came from.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.469
And you're never gonna.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.222
If you went bankrupt tomorrow,
I'd be like, "Hey."

06:29.305 --> 06:33.184
-Okay.
-"Dad, Thomas is staying on the couch."

06:33.768 --> 06:36.437
At the end of the day
we're gonna sit there.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.358
-Be there for each other when we need it.
-100%

06:43.403 --> 06:46.781
-Look at how big my s'more is.
-Get your stick out of there.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.084
Like, why am I being yelled at?
Why am I being cussed out at?

06:58.167 --> 07:02.213
I'd rather talk to you and get through it
rather than you have this built-up anger

07:02.296 --> 07:05.883
and then blow up and have me
feeling like you're coming at me.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.554
I'm genuinely afraid of Mia.
She's like a pit bull in a girl's body.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.723
Like, I don't wanna be on her bad side
and today I was.

07:12.807 --> 07:17.186
And I was firing back.
You want war? Let me call my troops.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.856
We need to have that moment

07:19.939 --> 07:22.733
where we all come together
and be like, "Yo, look."

07:22.817 --> 07:24.819
-Should I talk to her?
-I think you should.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.238
Actually, no, I know you should. Go on.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.868
Well, call her over, I'm not--
I don't wanna-- Just, she's right there.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.578
Do you wanna have it off camera?

07:33.661 --> 07:39.333
They'll record us no matter what,
and I know there's a camera right there.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.005
Damn, I do play peacemaker a lot, huh?

07:44.088 --> 07:47.425
I hope you guys aren't recording.
That's so against my brand. Gross!

07:47.508 --> 07:49.218
Ew! Jesus.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.638
-Okay, sit.

07:53.389 --> 07:57.685
Okay, Mia, she's a Leo,
she needs to be understood.

07:57.768 --> 08:01.147
There's a need to realize her wrong
for her to realize your wrong.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.025
I'm scared 'cause I hate confrontation.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.903
Just be professional,
don't add any emotion, 'cause you do.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.988
'Cause I'm a sensitive-ass little bitch.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.617
Y'all can't fight fire with fire.
Y'all need to treat it like--

08:12.700 --> 08:14.660
Oh, she's coming.
You guys should leave.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.663
-We love you, darling.
-Please go, this is gonna be so awkward.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.042
-Leave, she's coming. I'm so scared.
-I have to pee.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.712
Wait, I kind of regret this.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.297
I'll be watching.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.135


08:38.017 --> 08:40.353
Hi. I'm sorry.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.439
I'm sorry if I was rude to you.
I just say things.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.149
I already knew how you are.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.653
I seen how you talk to people
when you get upset. I just knew.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.988
-You act the same way I do.
-Yeah.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.283
I offended you, so you got defensive,
but I'm the same way.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.118
Afterwards I was like, "I get it."

08:56.202 --> 08:59.413
You're literally one of the most
honest bitches out there

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
and I don't wanna get in a bad term with.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.460
-I'm very blunt.
-You're just blunt and to the point.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.837
Some people can take it
and some people can't.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.509
So, bitch, I couldn't take it.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.595
My loud ass, even I stayed quiet.
When Mia talks, I stop.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.516
Honesty is the best thing,
even if it hurts someone.

09:20.142 --> 09:25.690
Like, honesty gets you everywhere,
and I watched, like, my dad lie

09:25.773 --> 09:30.236
endless amounts of years
about everything that ever happened to us

09:35.408 --> 09:37.827
That's why honesty is so important to me.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.455
But I don't do it right sometimes,
'cause I'm really aggressive.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.541
I didn't realize how hard your life was.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.294
I thought you were
a white picket fence bitch.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.011
It's a little frustrating

09:55.094 --> 09:58.848
that people think everybody comes
from a good place and a good home.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.809
I did have an abusive father growing up.

10:01.892 --> 10:07.189
I've dealt with my dad stalking me
and I had to go to court against him

10:07.273 --> 10:08.941
to get a restraining order.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.613
And so I definitely am very blunt
and harsh, but I don't mean it.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.156
I realize we don't talk.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.576
We're like bystander friends
and all our friends know each other--

10:18.659 --> 10:21.537
They know you and she knows me
but we don't know each other.

10:21.621 --> 10:26.917
And I feel like we honestly have a similar
story due to your father and my father.

10:27.501 --> 10:32.006
It's really hard seeing Mia like this.
Not everyone knows what she's gone through

10:32.089 --> 10:35.426
so I think seeing her at face value,
you might not understand

10:35.509 --> 10:38.304
and I relate so much,
because, just like myself,

10:38.387 --> 10:42.224
a lot of people perceive
the outside to be the inside.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.936
And everyone in the Hype House,
we have scars and traumas.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.897
We've been through it.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.649
We are… human.

10:49.732 --> 10:53.277
We just need to, like,
not hang out more because of the fight

10:53.361 --> 10:56.781
but get to know each other,
because you're gonna be in my life,

11:02.244 --> 11:04.538
-There's no point for us to fight.
-I know.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.250
Oh, my God, I love my besties
being besties, being friends.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.129
Come on, friends.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.339
Amen, bitch.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.593
Oh, Nikita, you did it again.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.973
-Do you have makeup remover wipes?
-Yeah.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.310
Don't whack me with that.
I'll pour beer on your bed.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.775
The princess says goodnight
to her subjects.

11:41.992 --> 11:45.413
Hey, so my trailer's,
like, really, really scary.

11:47.248 --> 11:52.628
It's 2:30 a.m. and I see
a full shadow figure outside of my window.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.466
I can't stay here,
I'm getting an Airbnb, for sure.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.095
I got a text from Mia, she says,

12:01.178 --> 12:05.474
"We're hearing
a female's voice saying, 'Hello.'"

12:09.311 --> 12:12.690
This is why I don't do this.
This is why I stay my ass at home.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.527
-It was like, 2-3:00 a.m.
-Connor was scared to leave his room.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.196
It was weird.
I stayed up the entire night.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.325
I thought I was gonna, like, die
or get possessed or, like, I don't know.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.411
I've been watching
too much <i>Ghost Adventures</i>.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.080
-What is up with this place?
-It's so haunted.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.375
I love things that are haunted,
it's super cool.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.004
I watch horror movies all the time.
Nothing scares me anymore.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.089
Like, screamo.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.174
How'd that go again?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.341
-What?
-That sound.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.265
How'd you sleep?

12:46.348 --> 12:47.516
-Terrifyingly.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.939
-Her and Thomas woke up to the same thing.
-Mumbling.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.859
I thought it was Kouvr,
but it sounded nothing like her.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.819
And then I hear, "Hello?"

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
Like, "Please, God, no."

13:03.449 --> 13:05.451
She said, "You hear that?"
I said, "Uh-huh."

13:10.164 --> 13:13.417
So we turned on the lights
and then we're just sitting there.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.880
This trip was my last hope at trying
to rekindle friendship between the houses

13:17.963 --> 13:19.298
but last night sucked.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.675
This place is also creepy.

13:23.093 --> 13:27.223
After last night's ghost UFO encounter,
I'm good. It's time to go.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.434
I would stay for longer
but we don't have those types of drugs.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.937
So we need to go,
immediately if not sooner.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.617
Since we're all together,
at the next stop

13:46.700 --> 13:49.161
I think we should do
a TikTok-y for Hype House.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.581
All of us are together.
Whatever we do will be a trend, you know?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.876
You know Atlas?
The Greek god that's holding up the world?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.795
That's is literally Thomas embodied.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.422
He wants the betterment
of everyone but himself.

14:00.506 --> 14:05.469
He's going through a crazy time and I want
to create content with the house.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.930
Have you seen the one
where the person will be

14:08.013 --> 14:09.640
in the middle of the group
doing the dance

14:09.723 --> 14:11.433
and everyone's trying to be serious?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.935
Yeah, I know.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.436
We're doing that

14:14.520 --> 14:17.606
but Michael's in the middle,
and everyone try not to laugh.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.108
That's gonna be hard.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.156
All right, guys,
we're here, we made it.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.620
Ladies and gentlemen, her.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.163
Hold it, bitch.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.792
Giving it, girls. Big titty, big purr!
Am I right, girls?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.502
Look, there's chickens.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.004
Hello.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.172
-Come get some.
-They're so cute!

14:47.011 --> 14:49.805
-Hello!
-They're so cute!

14:49.889 --> 14:52.433
-You are adorable!
-I would support the purchase of a goat.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.814
-I just felt something wet.
-Probably bird poop.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.441
That's not very nice.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.406
And I still can't walk perfectly.
I hate how hot it is.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.741
How humid everything is.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.911
And with my luck I can still
maybe get bit by a rattlesnake.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.914
Hello… okay.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.750
That was-- Good talk.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.835
All right, round up, troops!

15:19.919 --> 15:22.212
Good talk!

15:22.296 --> 15:24.214
Michael, you got it.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.636
I didn't think I was gonna have a crowd.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.804
God! No, no, no.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.474
Dude, it's so cringe, bro, I'm sorry.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.143
-Stop being a bitch, bro.
-Dude, it's so cringe.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.479
-It's so cringe.
-Michael's a little baby.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.898
"It's too many people,
I can't, it's cringey."

15:40.981 --> 15:43.025
"No, I don't wanna do a dance!"

15:44.109 --> 15:46.528
That's my Michael voice.

16:01.877 --> 16:06.632


16:14.264 --> 16:16.058
Bye, Joshua Tree!

16:16.141 --> 16:19.853
Thank you, no one died.
We don't hate each other.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.944
Creating content when we stopped
in Pioneertown was awesome

16:27.027 --> 16:28.862
but it's a little bit too late.

16:28.946 --> 16:33.993
I feel like we've already separated
and we're moving in different directions.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.414
Hey, "21st Century Vampire,"
10 million streams on Spotify.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.167
-Yay!
-Let's go!

16:43.544 --> 16:47.506
My first song was "21st Century Vampire,"
a song more so about being yourself

16:47.589 --> 16:49.591
and kind of owning who you are, you know?

16:49.675 --> 16:53.095
I've had these fangs
since I was, like six years old.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.638
Ha-ha-ha.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.932
That's actually crazy. On Spotify?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.100
-Yeah.
-That's fire.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.395
I have been in this long enough
to know who has it.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.230
Chase is a rock star.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.863
Congratulations, bro,
that's crazy.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.244
That's crazy.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.288
I'm not pregnant!

17:19.371 --> 17:21.331
Yay!

17:21.415 --> 17:24.835
I don't have STDs!

17:24.918 --> 17:26.712
That sounded like a lie.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.715
I don't think I have STDs.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.759
Yay.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.558


17:40.059 --> 17:41.518
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.395
-Oh, you have a chair?
-Yeah.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.023
-What are you doing?
-Tattoo show.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.608
You should have a backdrop.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.485
I wanna get this show set up

17:49.568 --> 17:53.906
but I keep forgetting I have,
like, brand deals to do, YouTube to do.

17:53.989 --> 17:58.660
I'm behind on, like, eight things,
eight things that are, like, big money.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.204
Brand deals?

18:00.287 --> 18:03.749
I have so much to do
but I've been taking care of Alex.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.710
-Yeah.
-I feel bad because he's been really sad.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.337
He hasn't figured anything out.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.589
-Like YouTube-wise?
-Like YouTube-wise.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.633
And he's been, like, stressed.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.678
Between filming his vlogs, keeping up
with YouTube, doing the Triller lives

18:16.762 --> 18:21.100
and helping everyone else with everything,
he just runs himself into a ditch.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.604
-Even though it screws him over.
-Part of the life of making money.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.690
He's also so scared,
which is why he works himself to death.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.693
-He's so scared of being…
-All this going away?

18:31.777 --> 18:34.988
And going back
to where we were two years ago.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.116
I mean, I think all of us are.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.367
Yeah.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.536
We don't really have a back-up plan.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.413
Like this-- It's either this or nothing.

18:43.497 --> 18:47.251
That's the part
that keeps us driven and working so hard.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.669
A lot of people can be like,

18:48.752 --> 18:52.339
"I'm gonna move back with my family
if life doesn't work out in L.A."

18:52.422 --> 18:55.884
If you don't have that, you're a lot more
like, "I'm gonna make this work."

18:56.510 --> 19:00.389
I also feel bad 'cause with his dad,
I don't think he got to cope with that.

19:01.181 --> 19:04.101
He just had to, like,
learn how to grow up.

19:04.184 --> 19:09.523
I think he has a lot of stuff to work
through with his mom and his dad passing.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.525
-Like, just 'cause…
-Yeah.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.444
It hits him harder
than he wants to let on.

19:14.528 --> 19:20.492
I've always been a fixer and a helper.
It's hard that I don't know how to help.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.745
It just makes me sad seeing him sad,
and even hurt.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.663
Yeah.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.860
-Is Chase and them coming?
-It's just us.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.408
My little wiener.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.829
-What? Quit looking at my wiener.
-I wasn't but now I am.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.040
You know they get
20 times smaller in the water?

20:08.123 --> 20:10.083
Mine's gonna be in my stomach.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.010
Oh, bro, the sand!

20:20.594 --> 20:21.887
It's been so long.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.098
So the beach is nice.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.851
-Did you have fun in Joshua Tree?
-Yeah.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.311
Yeah, it was good, I mean…

20:29.394 --> 20:30.979
The place was terrifying.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.732
…am I ever going back willingly?
No. But it was fun.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.859
How's your ankle? Better?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.070
I'm able to walk, so that's better.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.865
I'm dodging the question but how are you?

20:41.949 --> 20:45.827
'Cause I saw you crying at Joshua Tree
and I've only seen you cry three times.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.081
I think everything hit me all at once.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.584
I mean, you've been having
the same problem for the last two years.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.544
Yeah.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.924
I think I've just pushed
everything aside my whole life.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.425
-Mentally?
-Yeah.

21:00.509 --> 21:06.390
My problem is I've never talked to people
about how they've hurt me.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.392
I've never talked to my mom.

21:08.475 --> 21:13.105
I've never talked to my dad, my siblings.
I've never gotten anything off my chest.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.524
Right. You kind of bottle things up.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.610
-I know.
-You've gotta figure that out.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.695
I know.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.323
You know what you need? Closure.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.742
-You need closure.
-Yeah.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.413
After Hicksville,
I've started to pay attention

21:29.496 --> 21:32.833
to how this business is affecting me
and these people are affecting me,

21:32.916 --> 21:38.463
and taken a strong mental toll on me
and I think I might need a break soon.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.217
Things just add up and I think
I'm putting too much stress on myself.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.511
I mean, I completely get it.

21:44.594 --> 21:47.973
No one would know anything
about me if I didn't joke about it.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.393
I feel like we're both mentally unstable
in our own little ways.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.317
I think it's funny
we have different experiences

21:58.400 --> 22:00.569
but same reactions to how we act.

22:00.652 --> 22:01.486
Yeah.

22:02.446 --> 22:06.116
Just make sure to deal with
what's going on before it get too late.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.826
Don't want it to blow up.

22:07.909 --> 22:08.744
Yeah.

22:09.661 --> 22:14.207
Especially Kouvr has been telling me
for a long time to face my past.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.544
It really just comes down to if I'm ready.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.629
I'm emotionally numb from it

22:19.713 --> 22:22.799
and I've learned
that nothing worse can happen to me.

22:22.883 --> 22:26.845
I've been homeless, I lost my dad,
I was abused by my alcoholic mother.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.430
Life has happened.

22:28.513 --> 22:33.393
If I face it and I go for closure,
it's like, is it gonna help me?

22:34.561 --> 22:36.813
Or is it gonna ruin me?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.829
You ready? All right, hop up.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.336
Do I scare you when I drive?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.004
Only when you drive fast.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.047
Oh, like this?

23:02.130 --> 23:03.548
-Dog in the back.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.594
How are you feeling about today?

23:08.303 --> 23:09.179
I don't know.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.808
I'm excited because I haven't
seen my dad's grave in two years.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.852
I'm also kind of nervous 'cause…

23:17.354 --> 23:21.108
I don't see it enough, I feel bad,
I make a lot of jokes and…

23:21.191 --> 23:24.027
I don't know, I feel like
I'm letting him down by making jokes.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.029
But I feel it's the only way to cope.

23:26.113 --> 23:32.369
I feel like he knows
that it was probably hard on you.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.456
-And understands, you know?
-Yeah.

23:37.040 --> 23:37.874
Yeah.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.627
Everything I've gone through as a kid

23:40.710 --> 23:43.422
is the reason why
I result to comedy as a way of coping.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.924
I feel like over the years
I've cried myself away.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.426
I haven't cried in years.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.471
And I don't think I'm capable.
I think I'm out of tears.

23:51.555 --> 23:55.058
It's sad but laughing is kind of like…

23:56.226 --> 23:58.728
my way of crying?

24:02.732 --> 24:04.276
It's been a while.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.821
Cemeteries are the most
depressing places in the world.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.084
Ah…

24:21.585 --> 24:24.171
-I don't know how to feel.
-Yeah?

24:24.254 --> 24:25.088
Yeah.

24:26.214 --> 24:29.968
'Cause I thought for sure I'd come here
and make a bunch of jokes

24:30.051 --> 24:33.346
and kind of, like,
wipe it off, like it was just…

24:34.639 --> 24:36.183
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.352
I don't know.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.816
It's crazy that he's been right here
for 11 years-- 12 years.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.486
I hate this.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.529
I really don't like it.

24:49.613 --> 24:53.158
The fact that there's no flowers,
and it's dirty, it's like…

24:54.659 --> 24:56.995
He wouldn't do that if I was dead.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.455
-Yeah.
-You know?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.542
He'd be here… all the time.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.797
It's just crazy, all I have
is the videos and the photos that he made.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.009
There he is, he's snoozing.

25:11.092 --> 25:15.055
Oh, he's gonna cry. Goodness, don't cry.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.891
My dad was sick my entire life.

25:17.974 --> 25:20.018
Before I was born,
he was diagnosed with cancer.

25:20.101 --> 25:24.940
All the videos he left my family
were for us to really learn about him.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.860
Alex got his new gangster hat.
Can you put it straight, though?

25:28.944 --> 25:30.487
-Fifteen.
-I guess not.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.990
Be careful, Alex,
you are such a daredevil.

25:34.074 --> 25:37.869
There is a part of me that, non-believing
as I am, he's looking down on me.

25:37.953 --> 25:42.249
Alex, what are you trying to do?
Besides break all the rules.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.542
Whoopie!

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
Geez!

25:46.294 --> 25:48.755
Like, he spent years…

25:50.382 --> 25:52.175
wanting to make sure we were okay.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.344
-Mm-hmm.
-While he was dying.

25:57.138 --> 26:00.642
And… I just wanna do something right.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.643
You are.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.605
-Sure hope so.
-I'm sure he'd be very proud of you.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.569
Yeah, maybe he would be.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.825
It's okay.

26:42.976 --> 26:43.810
Yeah.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.273
And I try to forget all the time.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.233
-Mh-hmm.

26:51.985 --> 26:55.822
I spent so much time trying to forget
a lot of stuff that happened.

26:57.032 --> 27:01.953
And I didn't want to cry, I wanted to act
like this little careless guy.

27:02.037 --> 27:06.291
And, you know, it just came out,
I couldn't stop it.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.835
And I realized that that's better.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.891
I might be more
like my dad than I thought.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.100
You definitely are.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.479
The whole goal when I started this vlog

27:27.562 --> 27:29.814
was to film every crazy thing
and show our kids,

27:29.898 --> 27:32.359
which is obviously
inspiration from my dad.

27:32.984 --> 27:33.818
All right.

27:33.902 --> 27:39.157
<i></i>

27:39.240 --> 27:43.244
An elf named Grant?
I think you're running out of material.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.455
My dad was--
He would be filming everything.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.671
This is awesome, huh?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.048
Look at you guys!

27:56.049 --> 27:58.468
I want to do the same exact thing.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.513
I wanna give my kids
a better childhood than I had.

28:01.596 --> 28:05.100
And the fact that
I make videos the same way he did,

28:06.434 --> 28:07.936
I think he'd be proud.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.739
I feel like I need to wipe it
with holy water. We're at a church.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.368
What is holy water,
what is it made out of?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.079
I think it's just blessed.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.997
Really? Is it, like, tap?

28:28.873 --> 28:32.502
Fiji? Voss?
What do they do? What is holy water?

28:32.585 --> 28:35.463
-Probably the sink.
-No way holy water's from the sink.

28:35.547 --> 28:40.927
I bet they have-- Order it in from
The Glacier of Jerusalem or something.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.865
-Hi, baby.
-Hello.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.992
-How are you?
-I'm okay.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.036
How you doing?

29:07.787 --> 29:09.789
A little frustrated.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.792
A little frustrated with Hicksville
and how it went.

29:13.376 --> 29:17.505
The trip didn't really go as planned
but I kind of figured that would happen.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.341
Yeah, I didn't expect anything else.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.093
Yeah.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.139
Sometimes I just get over it.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.935
The time in Hicksville really showed me
how far apart our two houses have grown.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.355
It reminded me
that we can't go back to what was,

29:34.439 --> 29:35.982
we need to focus on the future.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.443
I've worked so hard to build this brand up

29:38.526 --> 29:42.322
and I tried to keep everyone together
but it never worked.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.075
I mean,
plenty of content houses haven't worked.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.578
Maybe it just doesn't work.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.705
I think I've lost hope…

29:51.456 --> 29:53.249
a little bit in this business.

29:55.668 --> 29:59.380
I feel like the business model behind
content houses gets really complicated

29:59.464 --> 30:03.551
and I feel like it's kind of
setting yourself up for failure.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.054
People are separating
into their own avenues,

30:06.137 --> 30:08.890
and growing into future careers

30:08.973 --> 30:11.434
and I think that was
the whole goal of the house,

30:11.518 --> 30:13.186
and maybe it's time to…

30:13.895 --> 30:15.814
Maybe it's time for me
to focus on that too.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.983
Through all the negatives,
which are understandable,

30:19.067 --> 30:23.780
you can't forget about
the positive things that you've made.

30:23.863 --> 30:28.243
Just the fact that, like, you were living
in your cousin's living room.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.662
I think the hard part is that

30:30.745 --> 30:35.333
the reason that made this so special
was that TikTok was very new.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.794
So these kids didn't feel
like they were famous yet,

30:37.877 --> 30:41.840
even though they had five,
10, 20 million followers when we started.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.925
They all felt like normal kids.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.886
And I think that kept us
all so humble in the beginning,

30:46.970 --> 30:49.639
we were like,
"We're just kids messing around,

30:49.722 --> 30:52.016
hanging out, filming the content."

30:52.100 --> 30:56.145
It wasn't about numbers or followers,
we were just growing and having fun.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.648
But it just doesn't work anymore.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.197
And I think
it's just time to shut it down.
