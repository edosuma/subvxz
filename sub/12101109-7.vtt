WEBVTT

00:11.873 --> 00:13.289
My mum was Tommy's sister.

00:14.531 --> 00:17.741
My dad was... been...
a police officer.

00:18.984 --> 00:21.297
By the time of our inquiry
in 2015,

00:21.400 --> 00:23.368
Thurwell had taken
early retirement,

00:23.471 --> 00:25.197
believed to be
living in Spain.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.029
Two dead, sir.

00:29.132 --> 00:31.755
<i>Marcus Thurwell,
Senora Thurwell.</i>

00:37.451 --> 00:39.694
You want to talk about rats,
ask your boss.

00:39.798 --> 00:41.041
Superintendent Hastings?

00:41.144 --> 00:43.284
He told me there was a rat
in our crew.

00:43.388 --> 00:46.770
That rat turned out to be
an undercover copper,

00:46.874 --> 00:48.255
John Corbett.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.776
I think I've found the real
reason the Gaffer gave

00:52.880 --> 00:54.226
50 grand to Steph Corbett.

00:58.403 --> 00:59.611
Superintendent Hastings

00:59.714 --> 01:02.441
has been informed
of his impending retirement.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.756
We have identified

01:06.859 --> 01:08.171
a number of
high-ranking figures

01:08.275 --> 01:10.553
in a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

01:10.656 --> 01:12.141
This force has detected
no evidence of

01:12.244 --> 01:13.728
institutionalised corruption.

01:16.248 --> 01:19.424
We are so close to breaking
open Operation Lighthouse

01:19.527 --> 01:22.530
and OCG involvement
in Gail Vella's murder!

01:25.154 --> 01:26.431
The case Gail Vella
was researching

01:26.534 --> 01:27.846
at the time of her death
was the murder

01:27.949 --> 01:29.054
of Lawrence Christopher.

01:29.158 --> 01:30.538
That was, what, 20 years ago?

01:31.884 --> 01:34.508
I've been looking into
all the officers that were

01:34.611 --> 01:36.337
involved in the Lawrence
Christopher murder inquiry.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.271
Detective Constable
Ian Buckells,

01:40.790 --> 01:42.205
Inspector Philip Osborne.

01:47.935 --> 01:49.730
Sorry, wrong way.

01:54.424 --> 01:57.703
<i>Not only does this
force face enemies without,</i>

01:57.807 --> 02:00.120
<i>there are enemies within.</i>

02:00.223 --> 02:03.640
<i>I will personally see to it
those enemies within</i>

02:03.744 --> 02:06.609
<i>are made to suffer
the consequences.</i>

02:09.612 --> 02:10.854
<i>And later that same day</i>

02:10.958 --> 02:12.270
<i>you visited Lee Banks,
an OCG member</i>

02:12.373 --> 02:13.685
<i>on remand
in Blackthorn prison.</i>

02:13.788 --> 02:16.205
<i>Yes. To harvest
information on the OCG.</i>

02:16.308 --> 02:17.585
<i>When DS Arnott quite rightly</i>

02:17.689 --> 02:19.277
<i>did not deploy lethal force
against John Corbett,</i>

02:19.380 --> 02:21.071
<i>did you take matters
into your own hands</i>

02:21.175 --> 02:22.866
<i>and disclose to Lee Banks</i>

02:22.970 --> 02:25.179
<i>that John Corbett was an
undercover police officer...</i>

02:25.283 --> 02:27.250
<i>-No, I did not.
-disclosing this information</i>

02:27.354 --> 02:28.424
<i>with the expectation</i>

02:28.527 --> 02:29.804
<i>that it would be passed on
to the OCG?</i>

02:29.908 --> 02:31.461
<i>-No.</i>

02:36.017 --> 02:37.985
<i>The stuff
he's hiding,</i>

02:38.088 --> 02:40.436
I never thought I'd look
at the Gaffer like this.

02:40.539 --> 02:42.472
He knows his time's nearly up.

02:42.576 --> 02:44.060
He's been slated
for retirement.

02:45.303 --> 02:46.545
Shit.

02:46.649 --> 02:48.927
I've been waiting for
the right time to tell you.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.618
Maybe we should let
sleeping dogs lie.

02:52.137 --> 02:53.311
Come off it, Steve.

02:53.414 --> 02:55.071
How many times have
we criticised coppers

02:55.175 --> 02:57.556
that took retirement
to dodge disciplinary action?

03:00.421 --> 03:02.630
You got anything more
from Steph Corbett?

03:02.734 --> 03:04.253
No, I think about asking her.

03:04.356 --> 03:06.186
She's got a right to know
what happened to her husband.

03:06.289 --> 03:08.188
Maybe she already does?

03:08.291 --> 03:10.017
She might be blackmailing
the Gaffer.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.743
Steph? No.

03:11.846 --> 03:13.193
You seem pretty sure.

03:16.334 --> 03:18.128
What?

03:18.232 --> 03:20.510
-We've become...
-Oh, for Christ's sake, Steve!

03:20.614 --> 03:21.477
It's not like that, mate.

03:21.580 --> 03:22.892
-It's different.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.446
She's a Person of Interest.

03:25.895 --> 03:27.137
Chris.

03:28.829 --> 03:30.348
Yeah, we'll be right there.

03:35.456 --> 03:38.252
GPR detected a strong
subsurface diffractor

03:38.356 --> 03:40.289
and I gave a go-ahead
for a dig

03:40.392 --> 03:42.187
which revealed a strong box
of the type

03:42.291 --> 03:44.672
detected at the abandoned
printshop.

03:44.776 --> 03:47.261
Nice one, Chris.
-Thanks, Ma'am.

03:47.365 --> 03:49.332
Let's get EOD
to rule out booby traps,

03:49.436 --> 03:51.507
then proceed to
forensic recovery.

03:51.610 --> 03:52.853
Sir.

03:52.956 --> 03:54.510
Let's find out
what's in there.

04:06.004 --> 04:07.592
Alright if I call you Steve?

04:07.695 --> 04:08.731
Fine.

04:10.491 --> 04:13.149
It's taken a while
to organise his consultation.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.600
Are you able to tell me
why that might be, Steve?

04:15.703 --> 04:17.843
Just work, sorry.

04:20.329 --> 04:24.194
In the medical declaration
form that you submitted

04:24.298 --> 04:27.094
at the time of your
urine sampling, you listed

04:27.197 --> 04:29.510
a number of
over-the-counter painkillers.

04:29.614 --> 04:30.787
Uh, for what condition?

04:31.685 --> 04:33.134
Hurt my knee at five-a-side.

04:33.238 --> 04:35.067
My shoulder was squash.

04:35.171 --> 04:39.624
SMTU detected levels of
metabolites in your urine,

04:39.727 --> 04:41.004
consistent with the ingestion

04:41.108 --> 04:43.283
of very high doses
of analgesics.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.290
In April 2017,

04:50.393 --> 04:53.189
you suffered a serious assault
whilst on duty.

04:54.052 --> 04:55.295
I'm fully recovered.

05:05.063 --> 05:07.376
Recently been involved
in an operation

05:07.479 --> 05:10.137
in which a number of suspects
have been killed.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.278
One having been shot dead
by you

05:13.382 --> 05:14.900
and one of your colleagues,

05:15.004 --> 05:17.247
PS Ruby Jones,
lost her life.

05:19.698 --> 05:21.182
Yeah.

05:23.978 --> 05:25.808
That's not the first time
you've witnessed

05:25.911 --> 05:27.810
a colleague's violent death.

05:27.913 --> 05:31.641
DCI Tony Gates was killed
in a road traffic collision.

05:32.539 --> 05:34.334
DC Georgia Trotman,
your partner

05:34.437 --> 05:35.438
was thrown from a window...

05:35.542 --> 05:38.338
-Where you going with this?
-Steve...

05:38.441 --> 05:41.064
I'm satisfied that
none of the substances

05:41.168 --> 05:42.997
you've been taking
are illegal.

05:43.101 --> 05:45.241
This is purely about
your welfare.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.726
I'm here to help, not judge.

05:49.038 --> 05:51.247
You might benefit from
some time off work.

05:51.489 --> 05:52.904
No.

05:53.007 --> 05:55.078
No way. I'm in the middle
of a massive case.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.049
Do your duties routinely
involved firearms

06:00.152 --> 06:01.809
or high-speed pursuit driving?

06:03.846 --> 06:05.399
Sometimes.

06:05.503 --> 06:08.471
Normally, in this situation,
we suggest that the officer

06:08.575 --> 06:11.543
voluntarily surrenders
their blue ticket.

06:11.647 --> 06:15.375
Otherwise, I'm obliged to
report you to Head of Firearms

06:15.478 --> 06:18.274
who will then remove
your firearms license.

06:21.622 --> 06:24.625
-Okay.
-Thank you.

06:26.075 --> 06:28.008
So I'd like you to have some
medical investigations

06:28.111 --> 06:30.217
and then review you
with the results.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.701
Can we agree on that?

06:32.322 --> 06:34.048
Fine.

06:34.152 --> 06:37.638
I'm also obliged to inform
your commanding officer.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.333
Yeah.

06:47.372 --> 06:48.511
Steve?

06:52.170 --> 06:54.379
I want you to hear it
from me first, sir.

06:55.069 --> 06:56.830
I'm under medical review.

06:56.933 --> 06:59.488
The drugs testing found
high doses of painkillers.

07:02.076 --> 07:03.353
Yeah, well...

07:03.457 --> 07:05.528
I'm just glad you're getting
some help with it, son.

07:07.668 --> 07:10.050
If there's anything I can do
just let me know.

07:15.296 --> 07:16.643
Thank you very much, Sir.

07:18.610 --> 07:19.818
Yeah.

07:25.548 --> 07:27.343
<i>Take your time,
take your time.</i>

07:28.068 --> 07:30.070
<i>You're doing well, Jo.</i>

07:32.866 --> 07:35.420
<i>So, Tommy hid from you
he was your real father?</i>

07:37.905 --> 07:38.975
<i>Yes.</i>

07:39.079 --> 07:40.805
<i>Who did you believe
was your father?</i>

07:43.842 --> 07:45.430
<i>This person,</i>

07:45.534 --> 07:47.708
<i>did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?</i>

07:52.299 --> 07:54.197
<i>-This person,</i>

07:54.301 --> 07:56.406
<i>Did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?</i>

08:04.311 --> 08:06.589
<i>You have
one new message.</i>

08:07.797 --> 08:09.316
<i>Steve, it's Steph.</i>

08:09.419 --> 08:11.594
<i>God, I hate these
message thingy's.</i>

08:11.698 --> 08:14.321
<i>It's just I ain't
heard from you in a while.</i>

08:14.424 --> 08:15.495
<i>I hope you're alright.</i>

08:15.598 --> 08:18.118
<i>Coppers wife me,
I can't help but worry.</i>

08:19.050 --> 08:21.086
<i>That's it really, bye.</i>

08:52.462 --> 08:54.292
Thanks, guys.
Sure, Sarge.

08:56.190 --> 08:59.124
So the excavation detected
a strongbox.

08:59.228 --> 09:01.610
The contents of the box are
itemised as follows.

09:02.472 --> 09:05.165
KL-2.
A non-standard pistol,

09:05.268 --> 09:08.375
believed to be workshopped
from a decommissioned firearm.

09:08.478 --> 09:09.825
NABIS have matched
the pistol

09:09.928 --> 09:11.412
to the tailored cartridge
and bullet

09:11.516 --> 09:13.760
recovered from the scene
of Gail Vella's murder.

09:13.863 --> 09:14.933
Almost certainly,

09:15.037 --> 09:17.280
this is the weapon
that fired the fatal shot.

09:17.384 --> 09:19.697
-Fingerprints? DNA?
-No. It was clean.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.078
Almost certainly
the gunman was wearing gloves.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.356
KL-4, KL-5,

09:24.460 --> 09:26.566
gloves and
a black bomber jacket.

09:26.669 --> 09:30.052
Both items bear blood spatter
and gunshot residue.

09:30.155 --> 09:31.294
The blood is Gail Vella's.

09:31.398 --> 09:33.814
-DNA inside the gloves?
-Yes, Ma'am.

09:33.918 --> 09:35.160
Sweat deposits
inside the gloves

09:35.264 --> 09:37.577
matched DNA
belonging to Carl Banks.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.751
-Got the bastard.
-Yes sir.

09:39.855 --> 09:41.063
We can match Banks
to the gloves

09:41.166 --> 09:42.823
and the gloves
to Gail Vella's murder.

09:42.927 --> 09:44.376
He's the shooter.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.033
Any of it related
to Terry Boyle?

09:46.137 --> 09:47.345
No Sir, nothing.

09:47.897 --> 09:49.554
Great. Next.

09:51.349 --> 09:52.384
GN-1.

09:53.731 --> 09:56.734
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of distressing news.

09:56.837 --> 09:59.495
This knife is stained with
the blood of an AC-12 officer,

10:00.116 --> 10:02.291
PC Maneet Bindra.

10:03.533 --> 10:08.193
Fingerprints on the handle
match Ryan Pilkington.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.785
GN-2.

10:13.889 --> 10:17.030
This knife is stained with
the blood of DS John Corbett.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.653
Fingerprints on the handle
match Ryan Pilkington.

10:21.551 --> 10:22.898
GN-3.

10:23.001 --> 10:25.625
This knife is stained with
the blood of Jackie Laverty.

10:25.728 --> 10:26.902
Fingerprints on the handle

10:27.005 --> 10:28.593
match a deceased
police officer,

10:28.697 --> 10:30.422
DCI Tony Gates.

10:30.526 --> 10:33.046
Gates told me the OCG
slit Jackie's throat

10:33.149 --> 10:34.150
and while he was incapacitated

10:34.254 --> 10:35.738
they put his hand
on the knife.

10:35.842 --> 10:37.429
They blackmailed him
with the threat of releasing

10:37.533 --> 10:39.259
Jackie's body and
the murder weapon.

10:39.362 --> 10:41.330
That's why all these items
were retained.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.607
They're leverage,
going back years,

10:42.711 --> 10:45.058
right up to it being a threat
to Ryan Pilkington.

10:45.541 --> 10:46.715
Anything else?

10:46.818 --> 10:49.683
Any items related to one
or more of the following?

10:49.787 --> 10:52.582
Marcus Thurwell, Ian Buckells.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.825
No, nothing.

10:55.482 --> 10:57.139
Philip Osborne.

10:57.933 --> 10:59.659
The Chief Constable?

11:01.074 --> 11:02.282
What?

11:14.743 --> 11:16.779
Great work, you two.
Great work.

11:16.883 --> 11:18.091
Cast-iron proof

11:18.194 --> 11:20.507
that Carl Banks murdered
Gail Vella.

11:20.610 --> 11:23.096
I've got a call later
with the Crown Prosecutor.

11:23.199 --> 11:24.960
I'm sure we can persuade them
to withdraw proceedings

11:25.063 --> 11:26.168
against Terry Boyle.

11:26.271 --> 11:27.687
Great.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.689
Well, that's the least
we can do for the wee fella.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.725
Any updates from Spain?

11:31.829 --> 11:34.555
They formally identified
the bodies found at the villa.

11:34.659 --> 11:36.592
They are Marcus Thurwell
and his wife.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.558
Both have been strangled.

11:37.662 --> 11:38.870
And from the extent
of decomposition,

11:38.974 --> 11:40.907
they'd been dead a few weeks.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.047
A search of the property
detected equipment

11:43.150 --> 11:45.497
used for routing
digital communications

11:45.601 --> 11:46.429
with an IP address

11:46.533 --> 11:48.362
matching the ones
detected on devices

11:48.466 --> 11:51.262
belonging to Jo Davidson
and Lisa McQueen.

11:51.365 --> 11:53.920
From the evidence gathered
by Spanish authorities,

11:54.023 --> 11:55.680
Cybercrime are still
trying to trace

11:55.784 --> 11:57.475
all end-user IP addresses

11:57.578 --> 12:00.512
but initial work suggests
they're located in the UK.

12:01.444 --> 12:03.032
Oh, so the communication
originated here?

12:03.136 --> 12:04.275
Exactly.

12:05.241 --> 12:07.071
So, Spain is a decoy.

12:07.692 --> 12:09.142
Thurwell's a stooge.

12:10.453 --> 12:11.972
Jesus!

12:12.076 --> 12:13.871
Have you seen
Superintendent Hastings?

12:13.974 --> 12:15.079
Yes, he's just
through there.

12:15.182 --> 12:16.563
-Sir.
Huh?

12:24.019 --> 12:25.917
-Sorry to barge in.
-What have we got?

12:26.021 --> 12:27.781
I knew you'd want to
see this straight away.

12:27.885 --> 12:30.335
We've been monitoring messages
being routed via Spain.

12:30.439 --> 12:32.199
This is a screenshot
of a text exchange

12:32.303 --> 12:33.753
we intercepted
a few minutes ago.

12:33.856 --> 12:36.100
We're working on identifying
the IP addresses.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.309
JD. Jo Davidson.

12:39.310 --> 12:40.656
BP. Brentiss prison.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.833
I thought you put Davidson
on elevated monitoring.

12:44.936 --> 12:46.006
Yeah, but we can't take
the chance

12:46.110 --> 12:47.249
that that's gonna work out.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.251
Look at the spelling
of "definitely."

12:49.354 --> 12:52.254
This is the Fourth Man. Chloe,

12:52.357 --> 12:54.049
all these new files
have come in,

12:54.152 --> 12:55.844
Operation Lighthouse,
Lawrence Christopher...

12:55.947 --> 12:57.155
I want you to carry out
a search

12:57.259 --> 12:59.054
on this spelling
against anybody

12:59.157 --> 13:01.159
that we haven't
previously investigated.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.333
But good work.

13:02.436 --> 13:04.473
-Steve, Kate, with me.
Sir.

13:15.553 --> 13:17.175
Stand away
from the door.

13:21.076 --> 13:22.525
Production Order.

13:22.629 --> 13:25.459
Post-charge interview.
Hillside Lane.

13:59.977 --> 14:01.323
What's going on?

14:25.554 --> 14:28.212
Alpha Charlie One Zero,
en route to Brentiss,

14:28.315 --> 14:30.386

14:38.981 --> 14:40.120

the Governor at Brentiss
has approved

14:41.397 --> 14:42.882
a Production Order
for Davidson.

14:42.985 --> 14:45.160
She's State Nine

14:48.508 --> 14:50.165
Three seven,
first I've heard of it.

14:50.268 --> 14:51.649
Who's the requesting officer?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.136
DS Lomax.

14:57.966 --> 14:59.243
And the supporting officer?

15:03.764 --> 15:05.835
That's you, Ma'am.
DI Fleming.

15:07.423 --> 15:08.321
Shit!

15:08.424 --> 15:10.737
One Zero, we are
diverting to the Hill.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.497

15:12.601 --> 15:14.292
Driver, put your foot
flat on the floor.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.039
What is this interview about?

15:37.143 --> 15:38.730
Who's the requesting officer?

15:38.834 --> 15:40.353
How should I know?

15:40.456 --> 15:41.768
Our job is just to
get you there.

15:43.425 --> 15:45.737
Are there any new developments
in the inquiry?

15:45.841 --> 15:47.429
Stop with the earache.

-Great work.

to illicit communications

18:03.806 --> 18:05.601
between OCG members.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.844
Fortunately, we were able to

18:06.947 --> 18:08.397
intercept your
Prison Transport

18:08.501 --> 18:10.330
<i>and replace
two of the prison officers</i>

18:14.196 --> 18:15.922

<i>Enabling corrupt prison

18:18.304 --> 18:20.099

<i>They're all under arrest.</i>

18:22.687 --> 18:24.241
You're safe now, Jo.

18:27.036 --> 18:28.555
Thank you.

18:28.659 --> 18:30.212
I mean, you're really safe

18:31.075 --> 18:33.215
to apply for
witness protection.

18:33.319 --> 18:35.562
All my notes, all my records
will show that

18:35.666 --> 18:38.393
you acted under control
and coercion of others.

18:39.532 --> 18:41.396
You can live the life
you should have lived.

18:41.499 --> 18:44.192
Be free to be the person
that you really are

18:44.295 --> 18:46.332
if you tell us
who the top man is.

18:53.304 --> 18:55.272
<i>We know from
the illicit communications,</i>

18:55.375 --> 18:58.309
<i>you were taken out
of Brentiss to be killed.</i>

18:58.413 --> 19:00.449
We strongly believe the order
came from the same person

19:00.553 --> 19:01.795
who's been communicating
with you

19:01.899 --> 19:04.212
throughout Operation Lighthouse.

19:04.315 --> 19:06.455
This person you're protecting
doesn't care for you.

19:07.215 --> 19:08.733
You mean nothing to him.

19:10.218 --> 19:12.392
This man you believe
to be your father.

19:12.496 --> 19:13.566
Is he the one?

19:18.157 --> 19:21.677
Tommy told me
after my mom died.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.648
I had no reason to doubt him.

19:29.029 --> 19:33.655
He made me obey
this police officer.

19:35.795 --> 19:37.486
He made me fear him.

19:38.487 --> 19:39.661
Yeah.

19:39.764 --> 19:41.697
It was all a cruel lie

19:42.802 --> 19:45.322
to manipulate you,
to control you.

19:45.425 --> 19:47.393
You know what
you were born into.

19:47.910 --> 19:49.326
You're not bent.

19:50.637 --> 19:53.122
Be free of him, Jo.
Give him up.

19:54.779 --> 19:56.195
Give us his name.

20:18.562 --> 20:20.943
Prison officers
are isolating the suspect.

20:21.047 --> 20:23.705
AFOs will
secure the suspect.

20:23.808 --> 20:27.053
Advise when unarmed officers
are clear to proceed.

20:27.156 --> 20:28.917
Sir!

20:29.020 --> 20:30.401
When clear
to proceed,

20:30.505 --> 20:34.302
FIs will deploy to
the suspect's cell.

21:02.916 --> 21:04.124
Sir.
Nothing.

21:04.228 --> 21:06.265
-Not so much as a post-it.
-Shit.

21:06.368 --> 21:07.714
Has he said anything yet?

21:07.818 --> 21:09.544
-Not yet, Sir.
-Let's go.

21:22.971 --> 21:24.006
Resuming interview.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.077
Superintendent Hastings
has joined.

21:26.181 --> 21:27.562
You remain under caution.

21:30.392 --> 21:32.152
So, where have you
hidden it all?

21:33.982 --> 21:36.364
The computer,
the burner phones.

21:38.435 --> 21:41.403
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.406
I get mixed up.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.512
You packed Thurwell off
to Spain, didn't you,

21:46.615 --> 21:47.478
to be your go-between?

21:47.582 --> 21:49.963
-Images 76 and 77.
Spain?

21:50.067 --> 21:51.724
What would I
have to do with Spain?

21:51.827 --> 21:53.208
Thurwell could
point the finger.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.451
So you had him killed.

21:54.554 --> 21:57.592
Like Dot Cottan and
ACC Hilton, right?

21:57.695 --> 22:00.388
All these names,
my head's spinning now.

22:00.491 --> 22:03.770
And Gail Vella. Did you order
her murder too?

22:03.874 --> 22:07.256
I haven't the faintest idea
who you're talking about.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.087
Joanne Davidson. What's your
relationship to her?

22:11.053 --> 22:13.090
-Joanne who?
-Davidson!

22:13.193 --> 22:15.299
We know about her relationship
to Tommy Hunter

22:15.403 --> 22:17.819
and to a police officer
purported to be her father.

22:17.922 --> 22:19.510
Are you the officer?

22:19.614 --> 22:22.202
Did you have a relationship
with Joanne Davidson's mother,

22:22.306 --> 22:23.514
Samantha Davidson?

22:28.692 --> 22:32.281
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interviewee image 17,

22:32.385 --> 22:33.421
a copy of a photograph

22:33.524 --> 22:35.112
captured during
a lawful search

22:35.215 --> 22:37.390
of apartment G,
9 Croxford Street

22:37.494 --> 22:40.117
on the 24th of November 2020.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.430
Who can you see in image 17?

22:47.469 --> 22:48.988
Sorry.

22:49.091 --> 22:50.783
The woman is
Samantha Davidson,

22:50.886 --> 22:52.647
also known as Samantha Hunter.

22:53.199 --> 22:55.097
Tommy Hunter's sister.

22:55.201 --> 22:56.236
And the girl in the photo.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.824
I have not the foggiest.

22:57.928 --> 22:59.101
It's
Joanne Davidson.

22:59.205 --> 23:00.758
Okay, let me ask you this,

23:00.862 --> 23:02.864
did you and Tommy Hunter
convince her

23:02.967 --> 23:04.417
that you were her father?

23:16.429 --> 23:19.777
You, you, you.
You're going back years.

23:19.881 --> 23:22.021
I don't remember any of this.

23:22.124 --> 23:23.919
I'm not as sharp
as I used to be.

23:24.023 --> 23:25.162
Christ sake!

23:34.102 --> 23:35.759
Superintendent Hastings
has left the room.

23:50.601 --> 23:51.671
Yes, we're going back years.

23:51.775 --> 23:53.673
He's bloody right.
We've been going back years.

23:53.777 --> 23:55.710
This thing has been
driving me mad for years.

23:55.813 --> 23:58.229
Cybercrime aren't finished
tracing IP addresses, Sir.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.921
There's still a possibility
they'll detect evidence

24:00.024 --> 24:01.060
pointing at Fairbank

24:01.163 --> 24:04.063
Look, he's been in that prison
since 2015.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.479
Our search should've
shown up something.

24:09.896 --> 24:11.242
It's Chloe.

24:11.346 --> 24:12.761
So answer it, answer it!

24:13.452 --> 24:14.522
DI Arnott.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.249
She's found something

24:18.353 --> 24:19.803
in the Lawrence Christopher
records.

24:19.906 --> 24:21.390
Well let's go.

24:28.708 --> 24:31.400
Cybercrime have been examining
all the devices seized

24:31.504 --> 24:34.058
from Davidson, Buckells,
Lisa McQueen

24:34.162 --> 24:37.303
and the OCG men who attempted
to abduct Davidson.

24:37.406 --> 24:39.478
As suggested by
Superintendent Hastings,

24:39.581 --> 24:41.790
they carried out a search
for idiosyncrasies

24:41.894 --> 24:44.586
in grammar,
punctuation and spelling.

24:44.690 --> 24:45.898
You'll recall this is

24:46.001 --> 24:48.659
the last communication
we intercepted.

24:48.763 --> 24:51.213
And this is the last exchange

24:51.317 --> 24:53.319
between Jo Davidson and
the user she believed

24:53.422 --> 24:54.734
was Patrick Fairbank.

24:55.908 --> 24:57.392
Cybercrime told me
they picked up

24:57.496 --> 24:58.635
on the mis-spelling
of "definitely"

24:58.738 --> 25:02.224
going back to exchanges
with Lisa McQueen in 2019.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.575
We've been able to
extend the search

25:07.678 --> 25:09.818
into files that
we didn't have back then.

25:10.785 --> 25:12.303
This is a handwritten report

25:12.407 --> 25:15.099
from the Lawrence Christopher
inquiry in 2003.

25:21.589 --> 25:24.833
And this is from Operation
Lighthouse in 2019.

25:28.941 --> 25:30.529
Christ!
Shit!

25:31.737 --> 25:34.463
This is the officer's
signature on both reports,

25:34.567 --> 25:36.569
2003 and 2019.

25:38.191 --> 25:40.124
Come off it. No way.

25:40.228 --> 25:41.505
This can't be right.

25:46.061 --> 25:47.580
Are you sure, Chloe?

25:47.684 --> 25:49.962
Cybercrime are attempting
to trace IP addresses

25:50.065 --> 25:51.791
that correspond
to this suspect.

25:51.895 --> 25:53.137
Then we'll know for sure.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.486
Right. Well,
they better crack on.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.041
Outstanding work, Chloe,
outstanding work.

26:00.386 --> 26:01.560
Sir.

26:06.426 --> 26:08.601
All this time we've been
chasing shadows.

26:08.705 --> 26:10.189
If this is right, he's been
under our noses

26:10.292 --> 26:11.431
from the very beginning.

26:11.535 --> 26:13.330
For God sake, what does this
make us look like?

26:13.433 --> 26:15.470
Yes, but you heard Chloe.
We didn't have this before.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.368
It's one thing getting
your man, it's another thing

26:17.472 --> 26:18.749
getting the evidence
to nail him,

26:18.853 --> 26:21.165
I mean, that's the battle.
And battle we shall.

26:21.269 --> 26:24.479
Let's see what Carmichael's
got to say for herself now.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.343
Sir, wait.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.591
You two look like you've lost
a shilling and found a penny.

26:34.316 --> 26:36.802
Sir, we need to be cautious
about disclosing this finding.

26:37.803 --> 26:39.598
AC-12's being disbanded,

26:39.701 --> 26:42.393
DCS Carmichael put in charge
of downgrading Anticorruption.

26:42.497 --> 26:44.223
Yes. But after what
we've achieved here,

26:44.326 --> 26:45.949
I have got a sneaking
suspicion that

26:46.052 --> 26:48.537
AC-12's gonna be around
for a while yet.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.609
And, believe me Kate,
if you want it,

26:50.712 --> 26:51.851
there is a job here for you.

26:51.955 --> 26:53.128
Thank you, sir,

26:53.232 --> 26:54.543
but the point
Steve's making is

26:54.647 --> 26:56.166
this finding is gonna
throw our inquiry

26:56.269 --> 26:58.340
into the spotlight.

26:58.444 --> 27:01.654
Anything that might discredit
AC-12 will be held against us.

27:02.586 --> 27:04.830
What are you
talking about?

27:06.452 --> 27:08.005
Sir, in the course
of our inquiry

27:08.109 --> 27:09.628
into Operation Lighthouse,

27:09.731 --> 27:13.183
certain findings came to light
which relate to you.

27:13.286 --> 27:15.288
DI Arnott's been in contact
with Steph Corbett,

27:15.392 --> 27:17.083
John Corbett's widow.

27:17.187 --> 27:19.189
Yes.

27:20.017 --> 27:21.985
Well, look. I know about that.

27:22.088 --> 27:23.331
She told me.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.022
To be honest, I didn't know
what to make of it,

27:25.126 --> 27:26.714
so I just let it lie.

27:26.817 --> 27:31.132
She also told me about
your painkiller misuse, Steve.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.861
And I saw to it that
you got help

27:35.964 --> 27:37.621
rather than
disciplinary action.

27:38.173 --> 27:39.485
It's called loyalty.

27:40.589 --> 27:43.938
Sir, during
an unlawful search,

27:44.041 --> 27:45.491
an item was found
which relates to

27:45.594 --> 27:47.320
the missing sum
of fifty thousand pounds.

27:48.356 --> 27:50.254
You're not under caution
so anything you say to us

27:50.358 --> 27:51.946
at this time can't be
used in evidence.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.706
That's loyalty right there.

27:59.643 --> 28:00.782
Take a seat.

28:08.756 --> 28:09.791
The money...

28:12.138 --> 28:16.798
I swear to God,
I was tricked.

28:16.902 --> 28:20.215
I was handed an envelope,
I was told it was one thing,

28:20.319 --> 28:22.597
I threw it to one side.
Thought nothing more about it.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.600
It turned out to be
a big bundle of cash.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.292
I tried to return it,
I was blocked at every turn,

28:28.396 --> 28:31.571
before I could hand it in
as evidence, it was found.

28:32.193 --> 28:34.091
That was only half of it.

28:34.195 --> 28:36.818
You must've hidden
the other fifty thousand.

28:36.922 --> 28:39.545
Yes. Well of course I realised

28:39.648 --> 28:41.616
it could be a bribe
that might turn nasty.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.791
So I split it in half,
put one half safe.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.448
In case the OCG came looking.

28:46.552 --> 28:48.450
You know, it was my insurance
against them.

28:48.554 --> 28:50.487
But unfortunately for me,
before I could use it

28:50.590 --> 28:52.731
as leverage against them
or hand it in as evidence

28:52.834 --> 28:54.042
the other half was found.

28:54.146 --> 28:56.217
Instead you gave it
to Steph Corbett.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.253
Officially that money
didn't exist.

28:58.806 --> 29:00.014
I mean, yes.

29:00.117 --> 29:01.878
Yes, I could've handed it in.

29:01.981 --> 29:03.914
But instead I give it
to a young woman

29:04.018 --> 29:05.398
with two wee girls

29:06.123 --> 29:07.366
who'd've been left destitute

29:07.469 --> 29:10.403
because her husband was killed
in the line of duty.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.028
Are we done?

29:14.856 --> 29:16.099
No, sir.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.931
As part of AC-12's inquiry
into Operation Lighthouse

29:21.035 --> 29:23.278
DI Arnott interviewed
Lee Banks,

29:24.314 --> 29:26.212
who disclosed
the source of information

29:26.316 --> 29:29.146
regarding John Corbett being
an undercover police officer.

29:33.012 --> 29:34.738
I swear to God.

29:35.877 --> 29:39.674
I did not disclose
John Corbett as a UCO.

29:40.986 --> 29:42.263
I told Lee Banks

29:42.366 --> 29:44.575
that there was
an informant in the OCG.

29:44.679 --> 29:46.094
No more than that.

29:46.198 --> 29:47.716
I thought that Corbett
when he heard about it,

29:47.820 --> 29:49.477
he would go to ground,
he'd hand himself in

29:49.580 --> 29:50.892
at the nearest
police station.

29:50.996 --> 29:52.929
It was by way
of bringing him in.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.827
I swear to God.

29:54.931 --> 29:56.208
You must have understood
there was a risk

29:56.311 --> 29:57.554
of Corbett
coming to harm.

29:59.107 --> 30:00.660
Well, that is
the worst part of it.

30:00.764 --> 30:02.145
Yes. Yes.

30:04.112 --> 30:06.080
John Corbett
had been involved

30:06.183 --> 30:08.323
in the death
of four police officers,

30:08.427 --> 30:10.360
our Maneet being one of them.

30:10.463 --> 30:13.052
He had beaten
and tortured my own wife.

30:13.156 --> 30:16.607
So I thought he had it
coming to him in spades.

30:18.989 --> 30:20.473
But what I didn't know

30:22.303 --> 30:24.408
was that he was the son
of a woman

30:24.512 --> 30:28.619
I cared
deeply about...

30:30.932 --> 30:32.727
...many years ago.

30:34.902 --> 30:37.076
If there is one thing
I could take back

30:38.906 --> 30:40.286
it would be that.

30:41.943 --> 30:43.600
What a terrible
thing I did.

30:46.361 --> 30:47.846
What a terrible
thing I did.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.024
Giving that money to that
young woman was,

30:55.232 --> 30:57.407
you know,
by way of atonement,

30:58.960 --> 31:00.548
what little there was of it.

31:04.069 --> 31:05.725
Does Steph know
the real reason?

31:06.209 --> 31:07.244
No.

31:09.557 --> 31:11.697
And if she did,
what would she make of it?

31:16.081 --> 31:17.772
Who's gonna judge what I did?

31:19.878 --> 31:23.226
Her? The law?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.163
My colleagues?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.202
God?

33:22.069 --> 33:23.242
Sit down.

33:39.258 --> 33:41.881
AC-12 Interview by
Superintendent Hastings,

33:41.985 --> 33:43.642
DI Fleming, DI Arnott.

33:46.852 --> 33:47.991
Ian Buckells,

33:48.095 --> 33:49.234
you do not have to
say anything,

33:49.337 --> 33:50.338
but it may harm
your defence

33:50.442 --> 33:51.512
if you do not mention
when questioned

33:51.615 --> 33:53.928
something you later
rely on in court.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.068
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

33:57.483 --> 34:00.107
Image 124 on screen.

34:00.210 --> 34:03.282
Image 124 shows
Item Reference GGM-13

34:03.386 --> 34:06.285
recovered from your cell
at Blackthorn prison.

34:06.389 --> 34:08.839
Interception of communications
routed via Spain

34:08.943 --> 34:10.600
detected an Internet
Protocol address

34:10.703 --> 34:12.567
matching GGM-13.

34:12.671 --> 34:15.191
Analysis of GGM-13's
hard drive detected

34:15.294 --> 34:18.125
the communication
shown in Image 126.

34:23.509 --> 34:25.718
Analysis of GGM-13's
hard drive

34:25.822 --> 34:27.203
also detected
the communication

34:27.306 --> 34:29.170
shown in Image 129.

34:30.171 --> 34:32.070
Note the misspelling
of "definitely".

is a summary of analysis

34:41.458 --> 34:44.220
carried out by
a forensic linguist.

34:44.323 --> 34:47.464
All digital communications
on the hard drive of GGM-13

34:47.568 --> 34:49.259
where examined
using methodologies

34:49.363 --> 34:52.297
based on examples of your
spelling and syntax.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.817
Now, the report concludes,
there is a 95% probability

34:55.921 --> 34:59.373
the messages detected on
GGM-13 were written by you.

35:07.346 --> 35:09.935
of forensic examination
of GGM-13

35:10.038 --> 35:13.214
to detect fingerprints
and DNA deposits.

35:13.318 --> 35:16.528
Fingerprints and DNA
detected on GGM-13

35:16.631 --> 35:19.186
are a match to your
fingerprints and DNA

35:19.289 --> 35:22.775
with a probability
greater than 99.9%.

35:22.879 --> 35:23.845
Ian Buckells,

35:24.984 --> 35:27.263
did you order
the abduction

35:27.366 --> 35:30.197
of Detective Superintendent
Joanne Davidson

35:30.921 --> 35:32.233
and the attempted murder

35:32.337 --> 35:34.753
of Detective Inspector
Kate Fleming?

35:40.828 --> 35:42.036
No comment.

35:43.313 --> 35:45.246
Did you order
the murder of Gail Vella

35:45.350 --> 35:47.490
and/or James Lakewell?

35:51.390 --> 35:52.426
No comment.

35:53.427 --> 35:55.394
Further examination
of communications

35:55.498 --> 35:57.293
routed via Spain
harvested a number

35:57.396 --> 35:58.535
of Internet Protocol addresses

35:58.639 --> 36:01.435
previously unknown
to this inquiry.

36:01.538 --> 36:04.127
One such address relates
to a property in Edge Park,

36:04.231 --> 36:05.680
17 Maychurch Road.

36:05.784 --> 36:07.751
On screen Image 135.

36:09.305 --> 36:10.789
Recognise this property?

36:37.298 --> 36:40.681
with an estimated total value
of three million pounds.

36:40.784 --> 36:41.820
What's your relationship

36:41.923 --> 36:43.201
to Holte End Holdings?

36:44.512 --> 36:45.548
No comment.

36:47.343 --> 36:50.000
I've worked with you
three times now.

36:50.104 --> 36:53.107
Undercover in 2012
with Tony Gates' team.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.765
Undercover in 2017
with Roz Huntley's team.

36:55.868 --> 36:57.456
And this year
at Hillside Lane.

36:59.286 --> 37:03.048
Always the same
crap suits. Dad cars.

37:03.151 --> 37:04.567
I mean, you never put
your hand in your pocket

37:04.670 --> 37:05.671
when it's your round.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.156
You certainly did a grand job
at hiding all this,

37:08.260 --> 37:09.434
I'll give you that.

37:10.918 --> 37:13.058
But you are leading
a double life.

37:14.128 --> 37:15.302
No comment.

37:18.201 --> 37:20.859
Image 138 on screen.

is a summary

37:43.951 --> 37:46.333
of forensic examination
of HS-6

37:46.436 --> 37:49.888
to detect fingerprints
and DNA deposits.

37:49.991 --> 37:53.132
Fingerprints and DNA
detected on HS-6

37:53.236 --> 37:55.549
are a match
to your fingerprints and DNA

37:55.652 --> 37:59.277
with a probability
greater than 99.9%.

37:59.380 --> 38:02.280
Ian Buckells, did you order
organised criminal activities

38:02.383 --> 38:04.351
such as the raid
on Eastfield Depot

38:04.454 --> 38:06.836
on February the 15th, 2019?

38:08.665 --> 38:09.804
No comment.

38:09.908 --> 38:14.050
These messages originated
from a device operated by you.

38:14.153 --> 38:15.189
There's no point denying it.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.673
We've shown you
the evidence.

38:16.777 --> 38:19.814
We know from an undercover
officer embedded in the OCG,

38:19.918 --> 38:21.229
DS John Corbett,

38:21.333 --> 38:24.543
from a former member
of the same OCG, Lisa McQueen,

38:24.647 --> 38:26.511
that they sought approval
for the Eastfield robbery.

38:26.614 --> 38:30.584
Yeah, and they got it.
From you, fella.

38:33.034 --> 38:34.553
No comment.

38:34.657 --> 38:38.730
We know from testimony
given to us by Joanne Davidson

38:38.833 --> 38:40.352
that after
Tommy Hunter's death

38:40.835 --> 38:42.837
desperate OCG's

38:42.941 --> 38:44.805
retained clandestine
relationships

38:44.908 --> 38:46.358
with corrupt police officers.

38:46.462 --> 38:49.637
We also know from intercepted
text communications

38:49.741 --> 38:51.915
that these relationships
were orchestrated

38:52.019 --> 38:54.711
by one officer in particular,

38:54.815 --> 38:58.336
once wrongly codenamed "H.",

38:58.439 --> 39:00.614
now referred to
as the Fourth Man.

39:00.717 --> 39:03.789
Ian Buckells,
are you the Fourth Man?

39:05.860 --> 39:07.068
No comment.

39:07.897 --> 39:09.208
The secret life.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.764
The big house. The fast cars.
The bits on the side.

39:12.867 --> 39:15.456
Deborah Devereux. Is that
what turned your head?

39:15.939 --> 39:17.596
No comment.

39:17.700 --> 39:20.047
You know, over the years,
we have investigated

39:20.150 --> 39:21.497
all manner of motives.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.947
but the most mundane
basest motive of them all,

39:24.051 --> 39:26.502
plain simple greed.

39:27.572 --> 39:29.090
You were a DC

39:29.712 --> 39:32.335
on a bent team, Thurwell's,

39:32.439 --> 39:35.373
and as you made your way
up through the ranks,

39:35.476 --> 39:37.961
there wasn't anything that
you wouldn't turn your hand to

39:38.065 --> 39:39.549
as long as
the price was right.

39:39.653 --> 39:42.000
That's the top and bottom
of it, isn't it, fella?

39:42.103 --> 39:43.242
No comment.

39:43.346 --> 39:45.900
Oh, yeah. You rose
through the ranks, all right?

39:46.004 --> 39:47.764
Leaving a trail
of blunders behind you.

39:47.868 --> 39:50.215
How some people
can fail upwards.

39:50.318 --> 39:51.492
Beggars belief.

39:51.596 --> 39:54.633
And all the time we were here
thinking we were chasing

39:54.737 --> 39:55.841
some criminal mastermind.

39:55.945 --> 39:59.258
But no, just like
your old boss, Thurwell,

39:59.362 --> 40:02.365
who botched the Lawrence
Christopher murder enquiry,

40:02.469 --> 40:06.196
your corruption was mistaken
for incompetence.

40:08.026 --> 40:09.096
No comment.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.511
Your cover was so convincing

40:10.615 --> 40:12.444
that even your DCI,
Jo Davidson,

40:12.548 --> 40:14.515
didn't realise that
the blundering fool

40:14.619 --> 40:17.138
she was framing
was actually the person

40:17.242 --> 40:19.417
who was pulling her
strings all along.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.531
Yeah, right.
I'm a blundering fool.

40:30.635 --> 40:33.154
I'm only the one who's made
total mugs out of you lot.

40:50.033 --> 40:51.794
Ian Buckells, do you have
anything to say?

40:55.763 --> 40:57.178
Yeah, you see,
the thing is,

40:57.282 --> 41:00.250
DCS Carmichael is meant to be
taking over, ain't she?

41:01.528 --> 41:02.529
But she ain't in here.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.290
So that makes me wonder

41:05.393 --> 41:06.705
whether she doesn't want
to be associated

41:06.809 --> 41:09.363
with detecting
institutionalised corruption.

41:10.571 --> 41:13.781
Because officially,
institutionalised corruption

41:13.885 --> 41:15.093
don't exist, does it?

41:16.163 --> 41:19.477
Officially, "H"
or "The Fourth Man",

41:19.580 --> 41:21.064
or whatever
you want to call him,

41:21.651 --> 41:23.239
he don't exist neither.

41:27.036 --> 41:29.417
So that makes me realise
that everyone

41:29.521 --> 41:32.110
would be much happier
if this all just went away.

41:33.732 --> 41:35.803
So, I'll take immunity
and witness protection.

41:35.907 --> 41:37.702
-Thank you very much.
-Jesus Christ.

41:44.053 --> 41:45.503
So, give us something.

41:46.262 --> 41:47.505
Who's the top man?

41:48.402 --> 41:49.437
You?

41:56.790 --> 41:58.239
Tommy Hunter was the top man.

41:59.447 --> 42:02.105
After he went they all split
into different OCG's.

42:02.209 --> 42:03.624
I just passed on
the orders.

42:04.867 --> 42:06.351
It used to be
Fairbank and Thurwell,

42:06.454 --> 42:07.939
then it was Hilton
and Cottan,

42:08.042 --> 42:09.147
and now
they've gone,

42:09.250 --> 42:10.528
-it's just...
-You?

42:11.736 --> 42:13.531
The last man standing.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.502
So you did order
the Eastfield robbery?

42:19.606 --> 42:21.573
Well, a haul that size
was bigger than one gang.

42:22.712 --> 42:25.612
The goods needed storing,
fencing, you name it.

42:26.682 --> 42:28.822
Other OCGs wanted in on it.

42:28.925 --> 42:30.686
And you just
put the pieces together?

42:31.203 --> 42:33.412
Yeah, if you like.

42:33.516 --> 42:34.690
And you also put
the pieces together

42:34.793 --> 42:35.829
for Lakewell's murder?

42:36.623 --> 42:39.177
Thurwell's? Gail Vella's?

42:39.280 --> 42:41.351
How many times
do I have to explain to you?

42:42.456 --> 42:45.045
That's the OCGs,
that's their doing.

42:45.735 --> 42:47.634
I just passed things on.

42:47.737 --> 42:49.256
Have you no remorse

42:50.395 --> 42:52.052
for all the suffering
you've caused?

42:52.155 --> 42:53.881
Have you no conscience?

42:53.985 --> 42:55.573
I didn't plan it
or nothing, did I?

42:56.988 --> 42:58.230
They just kept asking me

42:58.334 --> 42:59.922
to sort bigger
and bigger stuff.

43:00.025 --> 43:02.476
Jesus Christ. You're sitting
the other side of this table

43:02.580 --> 43:04.098
asking us
for witness protection.

43:04.202 --> 43:07.343
It's me you're gonna need
protection from.

43:08.724 --> 43:10.449
Would you like
a glass of water?

43:21.702 --> 43:23.117
Image 145.

43:25.361 --> 43:28.778
Now, the murders of Thurwell,
Hilton, Cottan and Lakewell,

43:28.882 --> 43:31.470
I get why the OCG's
were the ones to order those.

43:32.575 --> 43:34.612
Like Tommy Hunter,
their loyalty was in question

43:34.715 --> 43:35.820
and they knew too much.

43:37.028 --> 43:38.857
Gail Vella was different.

43:38.961 --> 43:41.377
We know the last thing
she uncovered before Lee Banks

43:41.480 --> 43:43.413
passed the word on her
to his brother Carl.

43:43.931 --> 43:45.001
It was the corruption

43:45.105 --> 43:46.934
inside the Lawrence
Christopher inquiry.

43:47.038 --> 43:48.315
Tommy Hunter was dead.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.144
His son Darren's a nobody.

43:50.248 --> 43:51.559
The OCG had no good reason

43:51.663 --> 43:54.286
to order such
a high-profile assassination.

43:54.390 --> 43:55.460
But two police officers

43:55.563 --> 43:57.013
involved in that
original corruption

43:57.117 --> 43:58.359
are now high ranking.

43:59.084 --> 44:01.811
You and
Chief Constable Osborne.

44:02.950 --> 44:05.194
And both of you
had a hell of a lot to lose.

44:06.782 --> 44:08.128
Ian Buckells,

44:09.336 --> 44:12.650
did you and/or
Chief Constable Osborne

44:12.753 --> 44:16.619
collude in a conspiracy
to murder Gail Vella?

44:26.491 --> 44:28.355
Take your time, Ian.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.805
It's a simple enough question.

44:31.116 --> 44:32.255
But naturally you're aware

44:32.359 --> 44:33.981
failing to cooperate
with this inquiry

44:34.085 --> 44:36.156
would make you ineligible
for witness protection.

44:39.297 --> 44:41.195
And you're also aware
that confessing

44:41.299 --> 44:43.335
to conspiracy to murder
would make you ineligible

44:43.439 --> 44:45.510
for immunity from prosecution.

44:51.930 --> 44:56.141
No one makes mugs of AC-12.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.189
Interview terminated.

45:40.703 --> 45:42.498
-Nice one, mate.
-Nice one, mate.

45:47.883 --> 45:50.471
Well this is weird, ain't it,
wrapping everything up?

45:51.334 --> 45:52.784
Do you think
Buckells will talk?

45:52.888 --> 45:53.958
I hope so.

45:54.061 --> 45:56.063
The Gaffer wants him
protected round the clock

45:56.167 --> 45:57.582
in case the OCG
come after him.

45:59.170 --> 46:00.758
What we gonna do
about the Gaffer?

46:02.725 --> 46:04.037
I believe him.

46:04.140 --> 46:05.348
Yeah, me too.

46:05.452 --> 46:07.730
But if Carmichael takes over,
that's him out anyway.

46:07.834 --> 46:10.181
Yeah, probably me too.

46:10.284 --> 46:12.114
And me,
if I decide to come back.

46:13.736 --> 46:14.772
Will you?

46:14.875 --> 46:16.670
Someone's got to keep
you lot in line.

46:20.122 --> 46:22.124
You don't realise what
you've got until it's gone.

46:23.608 --> 46:24.643
Likewise.

46:30.822 --> 46:34.584
So, do you want to
talk about stuff?

46:37.691 --> 46:39.451
You don't have to,
just when you're ready.

46:42.627 --> 46:43.766
I've been
seeing the MO.

46:45.147 --> 46:46.458
About the painkillers.

46:47.494 --> 46:48.529
Yeah.

46:49.254 --> 46:50.704
I had no idea, mate.

46:51.291 --> 46:52.913
I should have told you.

46:53.017 --> 46:54.087
But, if people knew
I might have been

46:54.190 --> 46:55.398
taken off active duty.

46:56.917 --> 46:58.125
Still might.

46:59.609 --> 47:00.645
I'm sorry.

47:03.544 --> 47:05.408
You just gonna stick
to the one drink?

47:07.031 --> 47:08.239
Why d'you ask?

47:09.999 --> 47:12.070
Still early enough
to drive up to Liverpool.

47:13.658 --> 47:16.109
I'm not sure it's a good idea
to keep seeing Steph.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.870
But, you want to?

47:18.974 --> 47:21.804
Yeah. But what chance
has it got?

47:23.633 --> 47:24.531
You wanna be careful, mate.

47:24.634 --> 47:26.015
You're gonna end up
on your own.

47:26.705 --> 47:27.741
I'm not on my own.

47:28.984 --> 47:30.192
I've got you, mate.

47:32.366 --> 47:34.852
We recognise
police officers experience

47:34.955 --> 47:36.715
stress and pain
in their work.

47:38.131 --> 47:42.204
They can take many forms,
particularly when an officer's

47:42.307 --> 47:45.448
witnessed lethal violence
or taken part in it.

47:46.656 --> 47:48.520
Now that's when
the support of friends,

47:48.624 --> 47:51.351
family, colleagues
can make all the difference.

47:54.388 --> 47:57.012
Me and my partner
are separated.

47:57.115 --> 48:00.360
I've got a son, Josh.
He keeps me going.

48:00.981 --> 48:02.258
And colleagues?

48:04.053 --> 48:05.952
Yeah, I'm lucky.

48:06.055 --> 48:07.436
Working with one of the best.

48:09.817 --> 48:11.854
To be honest, I don't know
what I'd do without him.

48:19.310 --> 48:20.414
Darren Hunter's involvement

48:20.518 --> 48:22.140
in Lawrence Christopher's
murder

48:22.244 --> 48:23.797
was deliberately
suppressed at the time

48:23.901 --> 48:25.937
due to Hunter
being Tommy's son.

48:26.041 --> 48:28.181
I've asked MIT to open
a cold-case inquiry.

48:28.284 --> 48:30.252
Try and get
a conviction this time.

48:30.355 --> 48:32.633
Hmm. Oh, good luck
with that.

48:32.737 --> 48:35.843
Ma'am, I'd like us to consider
opening a parallel inquiry.

48:35.947 --> 48:36.948
Thurwell gave the orders,

48:37.052 --> 48:38.536
no doubt at the behest
of Tommy Hunter,

48:38.639 --> 48:39.847
but it can't only
have been Thurwell

48:39.951 --> 48:42.229
who realised the investigation
was being sabotaged.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.506
Some of Thurwell's
subordinates

48:43.610 --> 48:45.129
are still serving
police officers.

48:45.232 --> 48:48.477
Historic corruption cases
aren't a priority.

49:10.533 --> 49:11.810
Come in. Thank you.

49:13.088 --> 49:15.124
-Steve, Kate.
Sir.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.024
Ted.
-Ma'am.

49:19.853 --> 49:23.270
I thought I should inform you
that I have lodged an appeal

49:23.374 --> 49:25.583
against my
enforced retirement.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.586
The Chief Constable's
about to make a statement.

49:28.689 --> 49:29.932
You mind?

49:30.036 --> 49:31.727
No. Go ahead.

49:32.831 --> 49:34.972
...a <i>tribute
to the tireless dedication</i>

49:35.075 --> 49:38.596
<i>of my officers
who have gained justice</i>

49:39.079 --> 49:40.632
<i>for Gail Vella.</i>

49:41.668 --> 49:44.188
<i>I give you my
personal assurance that</i>

49:44.291 --> 49:46.604
<i>any failings
in the original inquiry</i>

49:46.707 --> 49:49.365
<i>will be thoroughly
investigated.</i>

49:49.987 --> 49:51.816
<i>Lessons will be learned.</i>

49:52.920 --> 49:54.439
<i>Throughout my career</i>

49:54.543 --> 49:58.202
<i>whenever I've encountered
wrongdoing, I've acted.</i>

49:59.203 --> 50:00.480
<i>But, let me be clear.</i>

50:01.757 --> 50:04.932
<i>These are the misdeeds
of a few rotten apples.</i>

50:05.036 --> 50:07.176
<i>And to invoke
institutionalised</i>

50:07.280 --> 50:10.352
<i>police corruption
is an outrageous lie,</i>

50:11.077 --> 50:13.182
<i>and an insult to my officers.</i>

50:14.149 --> 50:16.254
<i>The public don't want
police officers</i>

50:16.358 --> 50:18.222
<i>to be held to account

50:18.325 --> 50:20.224
<i>they're meant to have done.</i>

50:20.327 --> 50:22.536
<i>They want us
to get on with the job.</i>

50:22.640 --> 50:24.918
<i>And that's what we will do.
Thank you.</i>

50:26.161 --> 50:29.060
AC-12. My team.

50:29.164 --> 50:31.338
My officers have just closed

50:31.442 --> 50:33.168
the biggest
anti-corruption operation

50:33.271 --> 50:34.997
that this force has ever seen.

50:35.101 --> 50:37.103
Just caught
the last ring leader

50:37.206 --> 50:38.759
in a clandestine network

50:38.863 --> 50:41.797
of corrupt police officers
and the Chief Constable

50:41.900 --> 50:43.592
hasn't a blind word
to say about it.

50:43.695 --> 50:45.801
Look, proceedings
against Ian Buckells

50:45.904 --> 50:47.285
are now
with the Crown Prosecutor.

50:47.389 --> 50:49.425
It would be premature
to draw conclusions

50:49.529 --> 50:51.565
about how much
was institutionalised

50:51.669 --> 50:54.603
and how much was Ian Buckells
working alone.

50:54.706 --> 50:56.432
Oh, if I may, Ma'am.

50:57.606 --> 51:00.609
Ian Buckells was
an incompetent officer

51:00.712 --> 51:03.819
who was repeatedly promoted
through the ranks.

51:03.922 --> 51:07.064
The more influence that he
gained over police operations,

51:07.167 --> 51:09.549
the more valuable
he became to the OCGs.

51:09.652 --> 51:13.070
Till eventually
this incompetent officer

51:13.173 --> 51:16.280
became the linchpin
in sinister enterprises.

51:16.383 --> 51:18.144
However, none of this,

51:18.247 --> 51:20.215
none of this
could've happened

51:20.318 --> 51:22.665
without the wilful blindness
of those in power.

51:22.769 --> 51:26.117
And those in power
should be held to account.

51:26.221 --> 51:27.463
It devastates me
that we've stopped

51:27.567 --> 51:29.327
standing up
for accountability,

51:29.431 --> 51:33.090
and we've stopped caring
about truth and integrity.

51:33.193 --> 51:36.679
Because it is these
institutional failures

51:36.783 --> 51:40.235
that enable the likes
of Ian Buckells to be corrupt.

51:43.272 --> 51:44.308
Ma'am.

51:49.796 --> 51:51.315
-Thanks, Chloe.
Ma'am.

51:52.281 --> 51:53.800
I'll let you out, sir.

52:23.623 --> 52:24.624
Ma'am.

52:30.768 --> 52:33.150
I'd like to make a statement
about my involvement

52:33.253 --> 52:34.944
in the leak
of information

52:35.048 --> 52:36.705
that led
to the unlawful killing

52:39.121 --> 52:40.743
of a serving
police officer,

52:40.847 --> 52:42.400
Detective Sergeant
John Corbett.

52:43.539 --> 52:45.541
In an interview
conducted by me

52:46.749 --> 52:48.199
on a convicted OCG member,

52:48.303 --> 52:49.856
Lee Banks,
in Blackthorn prison

52:49.959 --> 52:51.616
on the 12th of March, 2019...

52:53.756 --> 52:57.346
...I disclosed that there was
an informant in the OCG.

52:57.450 --> 53:00.107
I believe that this
information was passed on.

53:01.005 --> 53:02.593
And whether
or not it was deduced

53:02.696 --> 53:03.973
that Corbett was a UCO,

53:04.077 --> 53:05.389
he was murdered

53:07.114 --> 53:09.427
because of the consequences
of my actions.

53:14.121 --> 53:16.572
What do you expect me to do
with that information?

53:20.749 --> 53:22.440
That's entirely
up to you, Ma'am.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.719
But whatever you do,

53:27.859 --> 53:30.483
you do it because you care
about truth

53:32.036 --> 53:33.555
and accountability.

53:35.039 --> 53:38.456
You do it because
you carry the fire.
