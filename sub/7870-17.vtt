Think he's okay?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.110
Eh...

01:09.194 --> 01:10.570
(raspy)
Thank you.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.072
Just drink some water,
you're all right.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.948
Oh, yeah, you don't
want to go to the hospital

01:14.032 --> 01:14.991

01:41.392 --> 01:43.144
Some casual Friday this is.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.146
You're outta here, drug-o.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.773
And don't forget,
federal law mandates

01:46.856 --> 01:48.983
that we consider alcohol a drug.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.070

D'oh...!

01:54.072 --> 01:55.365

02:18.680 --> 02:21.182
Homie!
You're home early!

02:21.266 --> 02:23.476
Well, I didn't feel like
going to Moe's today.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.437
Thought I might hang out here
for as long as I could take it.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.273
Company physical coming up,
huh?

02:28.356 --> 02:30.733
Yeah, but a weekend without
drinking is no big deal.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.112
I did it when I was in
that alcohol-induced coma.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.740
So, what's on the agenda?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.325
Well, we're having brunch
with my sisters.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.368
(moans)

02:40.451 --> 02:41.661
You're hosting my
Preteen Braves meeting.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.745
(moans louder)

02:42.829 --> 02:43.913
And we're gonna make
dreamcatchers

02:43.997 --> 02:45.915
-out of litter we pick up.
-(moans loudly)

02:45.999 --> 02:47.750
You promised
to help me write a haiku.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.669
Why did I do that?

02:49.752 --> 02:51.754
It sounds so dull and boring.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.256
What was I thinking?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.759
-Thank you!
-Huh?!

02:56.843 --> 02:58.803
And you and I
were going to study

02:58.887 --> 03:00.263
the municipal voter's guide.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.598

03:01.681 --> 03:04.350
Section 1 of Article 21
of the State Constitution

03:04.434 --> 03:06.144

In the year following the year
in which the national census

03:09.063 --> 03:10.523
is taken under
the direction of Congress

03:10.607 --> 03:13.526
at the beginning of each decade,
the Legislature shall adjust

03:13.610 --> 03:15.862
the boundary lines
of Congressional, State Senate

03:15.945 --> 03:16.988
and Assembly districts--

03:17.071 --> 03:19.741
(wailing)

03:19.824 --> 03:22.452
Liquor,
mustn't think of liquor...

GRAMPA'S VOICE: Hey, there!
What's cookin'?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.665
Come on, boy, crack my seal

03:27.749 --> 03:29.083

03:29.167 --> 03:31.502
(screaming)
Owwww!

03:31.586 --> 03:32.837
(stammering)

03:32.921 --> 03:34.672
Wait a minute--
that feels good.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.798
Mm!

03:39.302 --> 03:41.804
So, a sober weekend
hasn't been that hard.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.432
Let me just take a few
antidepressants here.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.769
(gulping)

03:47.852 --> 03:50.480
I feel sorry for people
without willpower.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.649
I truly do.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.900
Homie,
what are you drinking?

03:53.983 --> 03:58.404
A surprisingly not-horrible
fruit drink called a mimosa.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.074
There's champagne in those!

04:01.157 --> 04:03.326
(shrieks)
Then there's champagne in me!

04:03.409 --> 04:05.036
Oh, what am I gonna do?

04:05.119 --> 04:07.288
It's less than 24 hours
till my drug test!

04:07.372 --> 04:08.831
Maybe I can sweat it out.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.251
(grunting, panting)

04:11.334 --> 04:14.254
Oh, man, I'd better have
some coffee and iced tea.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.090
No!
Irish and Long Island!

04:17.173 --> 04:18.049
What about this lemonade?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.425
Mike's Hard!

04:19.509 --> 04:22.095
Then I better soak up
the alcohol with some food!

04:22.178 --> 04:23.263
-Whoo! Cake!
-Rum cake!

04:23.346 --> 04:24.639
-Crepes!
-Suzette!

04:24.722 --> 04:26.099
Cherries!

04:26.182 --> 04:28.309
Whoo! Jubilee!

04:34.774 --> 04:35.692

04:38.903 --> 04:40.947
Wow,
passed with flying colors!

04:41.030 --> 04:42.532
I've sure earned this!

04:51.457 --> 04:54.836
O, Lord,
I have once again besotted

04:54.919 --> 04:56.587
my liver with
Thy fermented gifts.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.923
If You can weasel me out
of this physical,

04:59.007 --> 05:01.050
I will blow Your mind
by doing something

05:01.134 --> 05:04.053
incredibly holy,
at some point. Amen.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.555
Now to mumble
in a religious fashion.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.099
Dear God, O, Lord,
O, God, O, Lord...

05:08.182 --> 05:10.518
O, Lord, O, God,
O, Lord Almighty.

Hm...

05:14.897 --> 05:17.900
your cells have been
overexposed to gamma radiation.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.027
Like the Hulk?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.695
Well,
sort of like the Hulk.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.988
But instead of getting powerful,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.032
you're going to get
very, very sick.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.700
(moans)

05:25.783 --> 05:27.035
Hulk smash...

05:27.118 --> 05:31.247
Yes, Hulk smash.
(chuckles)

05:31.331 --> 05:32.915
Mr. Burns, you are liable

05:32.999 --> 05:35.168
for thousands
of dollars per employee,

05:35.251 --> 05:38.087
not to mention
my extensive fees which...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.589
(screams)

05:39.672 --> 05:41.174
This trapdoor app
works like a charm.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.925
Excellent.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.677
LAWYER:
You'll still have to pay!

05:44.761 --> 05:46.012
(sighs)

05:46.095 --> 05:47.805
This is the last time
I pay the price

05:47.889 --> 05:50.266
for the irritating mortality
of the human worker.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.226
Smithers,
it's time to re-staff with

05:52.310 --> 05:54.687
the super-intelligent
kangaroos we've been breeding!

05:54.771 --> 05:56.439
I'm sorry, sir, but they
just filled their pouches

05:56.522 --> 05:58.274
with office supplies
and hopped away.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.692
Even the joeys?

05:59.776 --> 06:02.153
You know, sir, there is
a more high-tech solution.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.280
More high-tech
than kangaroos?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.783
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:06.866 --> 06:09.202
meet the future masters
of the human race.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.454
(<i>Night on Bald Mountain</i> playing)

06:15.041 --> 06:16.709
(shrieks)
Comicon nerds!

06:16.793 --> 06:18.753
You fool!
These are robots!

06:18.836 --> 06:20.213
You will train them

06:20.296 --> 06:22.715
and they will replace you.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.220
I give you permission to shake
your fists in anger twice.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.971
(employees growl twice)

06:29.055 --> 06:30.765
I didn't say, Monty Says.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.141
Now I have cause
to terminate.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.351
-(angry muttering)
-LENNY: This is crap.

06:33.434 --> 06:36.187
-Now get out.
-You didn't say Monty Says.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.438
This is no game!

06:44.237 --> 06:45.321
Excellent.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.533
Sir, I'm afraid we do need
to keep one human worker--

06:48.616 --> 06:51.077
to sign for packages,
a scapegoat for meltdowns,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.162
things that would be
a waste of the robots' time.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.916
(groans) So we need one
meat sock on the payroll.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.877
-But who?
-Mr. Burns, before I leave,

06:59.961 --> 07:02.672
I got a few things
to get off my chest.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.675
One, I like the new microwave
in the break room.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.844
Just push "popcorn," you don't
have to know how long.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.848
Two, replacing us with robots
is heartless and despicable.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.809
Three, how about a farewell
party with a caricature artist?

07:14.892 --> 07:17.770
You know, it's something both
kids and adults can enjoy.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.856
So, to sum up:
nicely done,

07:19.939 --> 07:22.275
we hate you,
and food for thought.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.193
Simpson, wait!

07:24.277 --> 07:26.362
As it turns out,
there is one job available.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.865
But be forewarned,
it promises naught

07:28.948 --> 07:31.117
but soul-crushing boredom.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.327
Does the chair go back
like this?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.872
-Yes.
-Whoo-hoo!

07:36.873 --> 07:39.292
(groans)

07:40.626 --> 07:43.004
Well, looks like
we've found this plant's

07:43.087 --> 07:45.006
one remaining worker
of bone and sinew.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.676
(chuckles) Sir, I believe there
are two, including yours truly.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.387
It's one, excluding
mine falsely!

07:51.471 --> 07:54.891
Well, surely no robot
can replace me.

07:54.974 --> 07:55.975
Oh!

07:57.101 --> 07:58.436
Mmm!

08:01.564 --> 08:03.024
(whirring)

08:03.107 --> 08:04.484
I can do that.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.903
(imitates whirring)

08:06.986 --> 08:08.988
What about this?

08:09.071 --> 08:12.575
(jaunty 1920s music playing)

08:12.658 --> 08:14.827
(groans)

08:17.580 --> 08:19.916
(tires screeching)

08:19.999 --> 08:22.793
(scoffs)
Nice parking, idiot.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.177
So, uh, you guys
are my new coworkers.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.721
So, workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.348
(chuckles)

08:35.431 --> 08:38.559
I said, workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

08:38.643 --> 08:42.230
Workin' hard
or hardly working?!

08:42.313 --> 08:46.692
Working hard or
hardly working?!

08:46.776 --> 08:48.736
It's a simple question!

08:48.819 --> 08:51.822
Are you A) working hard

08:51.906 --> 08:54.075
or B)-- Ow!

08:54.158 --> 08:56.410
(giddy laughter)

08:56.494 --> 08:58.746
I guess I just met
the joker of the group.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.250
Better watch out for you
on April Fool's, am I right?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.627
I said, am I right?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.504
Am I... (yells)

09:06.587 --> 09:09.090
So, you guys have any luck
finding a new job?

09:09.173 --> 09:10.925
Does it look like
I've got a job?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.009
No, I didn't.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.970
Homer,
show a little more sensitivity

09:14.053 --> 09:15.596
around these
jobless washouts, eh?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.224
Hey, I gotta tell ya,
I'm miserable there.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.851
I'm all alone,
and when there's some problem

09:20.935 --> 09:23.771
due to human error,
guess who gets blamed?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.940
Hey, Homer, you know what
I'm playing for ya?

09:26.023 --> 09:27.608
The world's smallest violin.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.194
And now I got to sell it,
just to make my rent!

09:31.696 --> 09:33.197
Oh, my God!
Where's the bow?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.782
I can't sell it
without the bow!

09:34.865 --> 09:36.200
Easy, easy there, Lenny.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.286
You can always
play it pizzicato.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.289
The buyer clearly specified
violin and bow!

09:41.372 --> 09:42.498
(Lenny crying)

09:42.582 --> 09:44.000
Um, maybe I should be
heading home.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.042
-(crunch)
-Oh, no!

09:45.126 --> 09:46.711
He stepped on the bow!

09:46.794 --> 09:48.838
Boy, this place
has gotten so grim.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.172
I'm gonna do something
I've never done:

09:50.256 --> 09:52.258
Make myself a drink.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.512
Ugh!
You call this beer?

09:56.596 --> 09:57.847
It's watered-down swill!

09:57.930 --> 09:59.015
Oh, you got a problem?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.559
Well, here's
the complaint department.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.353
MOE: You know what I think, Moe?
I think you ain't got the guts!

10:04.437 --> 10:06.731

to the man on my pizza box.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.077
Mr. Burns seemed

13:00.237 --> 13:01.822
Do a lot of people pay?

13:01.906 --> 13:05.409
No, but I can also play

13:05.493 --> 13:07.828

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330
Follow the hats, where's
the wiener?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.998
Now you see it,
now you don't.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.628
So, Bart, the little dickens,
is going through that phase
