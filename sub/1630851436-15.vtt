00:49.716 --> 00:51.951
- Uh, principal?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.920
They told me you wanna see me

00:54.020 --> 00:57.624
and that you're-you're furious.
Principal, you there?

00:57.724 --> 01:00.126
- Gotcha.
- Wait, what?

01:00.226 --> 01:01.428
- The principal's at lunch.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.962
- That's not funny
at all, Brenda.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.697
I gotta question
your sense of humor.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.466
- It's super funny, trust me.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.234
- Since when do you have
a good personality?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.036
I thought you were the boring
lady who sits in the hall.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.472
- When the principal is here,
I'm buttoned-up Brenda.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.308
But once he leaves, man,
I let lose.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.943
- Let's get
buttoned-up Brenda back.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.079
This is not working.
- Here's why I called you in.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.980
- Okay.
- The principal's 20th

01:21.081 --> 01:22.715
anniversary at school
is coming up.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.318
So we're throwing him a roast.
- A roast?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.821
- Where you make fun of people,
but you do it in a fun way.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.590
And we want you
to be the roast master.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.492
- Roast master?
That sounds like a lot of work.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.294
I'm-I'm gonna pass.
- There's no passing.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.662
No, no. No passing.
- Eh.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.097
Count me out.
- It's been decided.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.331
We already went
to the print shop.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.833
We made a cardboard cutout.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.334
- I didn't approve that.
That's not sanctioned.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.069
- It's not up to you
to approve anything.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.405
Once you're on school grounds,
pfft with your rights.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.841
- I'm a minor, so you can
force me to be a roast master?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.076
- Yes. We'll force you to sit
in a room as long as we want,

01:50.143 --> 01:52.178
and we can force you
to make jokes.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.680
- I know we friends
and everything

01:53.780 --> 01:55.315
but this is a travesty.
- I know.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.617
- I got passed over
for roast master, for you.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.452
- I agree, you would have
been better, but hey,

01:59.519 --> 02:01.321
don't let it ruin
the sleepover.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.089
Do you mind if I run
some of my jokes by ya?

02:03.156 --> 02:04.624
- What you got?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.526
- I think I'm gonna open with,
"Greetings.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.927
"The principal is very excited

02:07.994 --> 02:09.529
"when he heard
we're having a roast.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.197
"But I think the guy
was--I think

02:11.297 --> 02:12.866
"he might have
thought we were

02:12.966 --> 02:14.634
talking about roast beef."

02:14.701 --> 02:17.370
- Oh, no.
- I gotta work on the phrasing

02:17.470 --> 02:18.771
but that's the gist
of the joke.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.206
- Yeah, we get it.
What else you got?

02:20.306 --> 02:22.375
- The principal drives
a Ford Fiesta,

02:22.475 --> 02:23.810
which is Spanish for "party."

02:23.877 --> 02:25.445
But the last time I checked
this guy's a real

02:25.512 --> 02:27.046
party pooper.
Am I right, people?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.715
- Man, this is gonna be
terrible, man.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.116
You gonna bomb.
- You're right, actually.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.451
This is not funny.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.819
- We got one night
to make you funny.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.053
- All right, what do I do?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.355
- Come with me, Tom.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.623
- Wait, where are we going?

02:36.689 --> 02:37.824
- Shh. My dad's asleep.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.659
I don't wanna wake him.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.495
- What is this weird room?
- This is a man cave.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.165
- Are we allowed to be in here?
- We not men.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.866
So technically
we breaking and entering.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.835
- Oh, my God,
what an incredible room.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.237
Wesley Snipes,
grown lady's boobs,

02:51.337 --> 02:53.239
couple of weird hats.
This is incredible.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.974
What do we do now?
- Oh, man, we are about

02:55.041 --> 02:56.409
to watch some roast.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.511
- Oh, he's got
a collection of roasts.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.181
This is perfect.
Learn from the professionals.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.216
<i>- Ryan is so unattractive.</i>

03:03.316 --> 03:06.186
<i>When he smiles at me,
I take an immediate shit.</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:09.923
- Huh, kind of
an off-color joke.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.525
<i>- Oh, Brian, look at the nose
on that guy.</i>

03:12.592 --> 03:13.927
<i>If you can find it.</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:15.662
<i>It looks like
a pig's butthole.</i>

03:15.728 --> 03:18.765
-
I love this dude, man.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.333
- Is that funny
or very hurtful?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.602
- At a roast you say things
that are hurtful.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.939
But then you laugh and say,
"Just kidding. Love you buddy."

03:26.039 --> 03:27.240
- Why not just say
the last part?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.741
- Oh, that's not a joke really.

03:28.841 --> 03:30.543
<i>- What a dog-shit career
this guy has.</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:32.345
<i>I mean, if I woke up
with that career</i>

03:32.412 --> 03:34.280
<i>I'd put a shotgun in my mouth
and pull the trigger.</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:35.949
Oh, Brian,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.284
<i>you pig nose son of a bitch.
Love you buddy.</i>

03:38.384 --> 03:39.886
<i>Oh, you're the man.
You're the man.</i>

03:39.953 --> 03:41.721
- Ah, you see people
are having a ball.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.623
Look at that.
- Right, but I can't say

03:43.723 --> 03:45.124
any of these things.
I'm a kid.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.960
- Like my dad says,
nothing more adorable

03:47.060 --> 03:49.729
than a curse word coming out
of a young child's mouth.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.564
- I don't think my mom
would agree,

03:51.631 --> 03:53.967
but you guys seem to know what
you're talking about over here.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.103
<i>- Uh, hi, gang.</i>

03:57.203 --> 03:59.038
I can't believe
you guys did this for me.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.475
It's--after 20 years,
I love you people like family.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.876
And as the saying goes,

04:03.943 --> 04:06.412
you can't spell "principal"
without pal.

04:06.479 --> 04:10.316
And that's--that's how you kids
make me feel.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.152
Not like I'm your principal
or an authoritative figure,

04:13.253 --> 04:17.390
just feel like I'm your pal.
And I--and I do appreciate it.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.160
- Wow, so emotional.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.129
All right,
I'm your roast master.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.831
If you need anything,
just holler.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.267
Uh, why don't we start
with Dakota.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.304
- Hi.

04:31.404 --> 04:36.776
The Principal is a real bozo,
like, bozo the clown.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.079
- Aw, so precious.
- Oh.

04:40.146 --> 04:41.681
Oh, she got me good.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.952
- The principal is here
and he's really silly.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.520
Am I right, guys?

04:47.620 --> 04:50.290
- Oh, man, I'm questioning
the material, I really am.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.159
- But we do love you and we're
so happy that you're here.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.461
Thank you.
You've been roasted.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.530
- Aw, this is adorable.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.199
Oh, I hope someone's
filming this stuff.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.304
- Um...all right.
Number one.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.706
The principal's glasses
are always dirty.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.641
- That is true.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.710
- The only thing filthier
than his glasses is his ex-wife

05:10.810 --> 05:13.780
Shannon who was
caught sucking off the UPS guy.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.848
- What?
- Language. Tom.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.116
Okay. Wow. Tom.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.551
- I got--I got more.
I got more.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.186
I shouldn't have
opened with that.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.355
The principal dreamed
of playing for the Yankees.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.857
Right, Principal?
- Eh, it is true.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.493
- But the last time I checked
there's no position in baseball

05:27.560 --> 05:29.062
called fat piece of shit.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.165
- Oh, this is horrible.
What the hell is going on?

05:32.231 --> 05:34.233
- Do you just maybe have
some normal jokes?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.569
- I was told foul language
is encouraged.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.538
- Who told you that?
- You know what?

05:38.638 --> 05:40.873
I-I know I had
some disappointments in my life

05:40.973 --> 05:42.575
but I didn't know--I mean,

05:42.675 --> 05:46.979
I'm gonna go drink myself
to sleep and cry into a sock.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.248
- I should have stopped
with the roast beef joke.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.918
- Hey, kids. Get back in class.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.686
Just because the principal
is out

05:53.753 --> 05:55.388
does not mean
it's a free for all.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.423
- Hey, go suck off the UPS guy!

05:57.523 --> 06:00.093
Bam, you've been roasted,
Tom style, baby!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.195
- They really latched on
to that phrase, didn't they?

06:02.261 --> 06:04.397
- Well, well.
- I came to apologize.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.766
- Sorry, Tom.
Principal called in sick.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.768
- Oh, no.
- He's very depressed.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.703
- I gotta say, I think maybe
Hector shouldn't have

06:10.770 --> 06:13.039
called him a dumb-dumb.
That was in poor taste.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.941
- Are you kidding, Tom?
Do you realize

06:15.041 --> 06:17.543
that all the teachers
are calling you Asshole Tom?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.379
- Now, that's
crossing the line.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.947
- Oh, that's crossing the line?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.782
Now you're deciding
what's in good taste.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.283
- Well, just tell him
I'm sorry.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.718
If you talk to him,
just tell him I'm sorry.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.387
- No, there's no
I'm telling him anything.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.622
You need to talk to him
and make this right.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.391
- All right,
I'll go pop in and say hi.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.693
I'm sure he's fine, though.
I mean, he's the principal.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.401
<i>-</i>

06:41.467 --> 06:43.703
- What's going on in there?
- Principal, are you in there?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.138
<i>-</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:47.106
- Principal, are you okay?
- We gotta get in there.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.609
- All right, you know what?
We're coming in.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.211
Principal?
- Oh. Hey, guys.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.147
Come on in. Grab a slice.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.449
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.985
- Are you sure? You really
look like a train wreck.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.320
- Tom, your insults
were a real wake-up call.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.989
And I've decided to quit my job

07:03.089 --> 07:05.491
and become an assistant bookie
with my friend, Lu.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.894
- Oh, no, don't do that.
Nah. Those were jokes.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.729
- I'm sorry,
which part was untrue?

07:09.796 --> 07:11.264
Do I not have a weight problem?

07:11.330 --> 07:12.665
- Yes.
It's not an ideal physique.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.067
- Did my wife not blow
the UPS driver?

07:15.134 --> 07:17.003
- She did.
That's a well-documented story.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.639
- Have I not failed at pursuing
all my childhood dreams?

07:19.739 --> 07:21.474
- You've clearly failed
at many things.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.476
But we can--you can laugh
about it now, right?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.111
- Nah, you just don't laugh.
It's tragic.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.612
Look at my bucket list.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.514
I've crossed
not one thing off of it!

07:28.614 --> 07:29.982
- Huh, let's see
what you got here.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.818
Sit on a hammock?
That's pretty easy to do.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.086
- Well, I literally sat
on a hammock an hour ago.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.688
- Eat a steak?
- Yeah.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.457
- You've never eaten a steak?
- I've come close but,

07:37.523 --> 07:39.258
you know, something always
goes wrong.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.194
- These seem like very easy
dreams to achieve.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.929
- Yeah, well, that's what
makes it so pathetic.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.430
- Oh, how does this sound?
Look.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.799
If we help you check
everything off your list,

07:46.866 --> 07:48.367
you come back
to school on Monday.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.303
- How are you gonna help me
check every single thing

07:50.369 --> 07:51.971
off this bucket list?
Take another look at it.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.306
- Principal, we're gonna do it.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.674
We're not taking no
for an answer.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.209
- Deal.
- That's great. All right.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.710
Let's shake.
Oh, wow. That's disgusting.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.312
That's a very greasy hand.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.815
- Number ten on the list.
Sit on a hammock.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.383
- I did it.
Check it off the list.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.052
I sat in a hammock.
Yes!

08:06.152 --> 08:08.120
- Okay. You sat in a hammock.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.157
- Oh, my God, I ate a steak!
After all these years.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.860
Check another one
off the list, baby!

08:13.960 --> 08:15.795
- Number three on the list,
believe it or not,

08:15.862 --> 08:20.399
is slide down a bowling alley
like a human bowling ball.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.171
- Wow, that's top five?

08:25.238 --> 08:28.140
- Oh, my God,
I'm riding in a Buick.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.809
Check it off the list.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.511
- Did number two on the list
really say "ride in Buick"?

08:32.578 --> 08:35.081
- Says it right here.
"Ride in a late model Buick."

08:36.515 --> 08:38.718
- Okay, one last thing
on the list.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.755
See Glenn Hubert the comedian.
Who's Glenn Hubert by the way?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.557
- He's only my favorite
comedian.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.193
He does a clean act, just like
a ton of observational humor

08:47.260 --> 08:50.930
about church and pudding
and cookies and picnics.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.331
- Sounds like he sucks.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.667
- Wait. Wait, what's this?
Sold out. Oh, no.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.436
- This is just...
just the story of my life.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.239
I'm, like, so close
and then I blow it.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.675
My neighbor's right.
I don't deserve to be happy.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.076
- C'mon, don't give up.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.945
We promised we would get
you to return to school.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.080
Let me--let me see
what I can do.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.715
- Go ahead.
- Hey.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.217
Can I have a quick chat?
- Mm-hmm.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.219
- Can we--can we talk,
comedian to comedian?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.921
- I'm a doorman.
I'm not a comedian.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.522
I'm not funny.
- Seem pretty funny.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.924
- No, I'm not funny.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.458
- Is there any way
you could sneak us in

09:19.559 --> 09:21.427
to see Glenn Hubert?
It's for my pal.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.930
He's not doing so well.
He's seen better days.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.865
- What, your pal? Which one?

09:25.932 --> 09:27.366
- Over there, over my shoulder.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.101
- That's so sad.
- It is sad.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.870
The number one thing
on his bucket list,

09:30.937 --> 09:32.071
you ready for this?

09:32.138 --> 09:34.073
See Glenn Hubert
live in concert.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.541
- I'll talk to Glenn.
- That's amazing.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.976
- Maybe he'll even give him
a shout out.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.811
He loves doing
good deeds like this.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.580
- That's a very good deed.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.481
Listen, if I can ever repay
the favor, just say the word.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.150
- Okay. What is it he can do?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.152
- Anything, as long as, like,
it's related to the bassoon

09:46.252 --> 09:48.154
or Wiffle ball
or basic things like that.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.956
If you need a back--you wanna
borrow a backpack?

09:50.056 --> 09:51.490
- Why would I want a backpack?
- I don't know.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.793
I can't repay the favor.
This is a one way street.

09:53.893 --> 09:55.261
All right, guys,
I pulled some strings.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.929
I told him I'm a roast master.
We're in.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.097
- What?
Oh, you're the best.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.398
- We're seeing the whole act.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.467
Glenn Hubert, Todd Glass
and free nachos.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.836
- Wow.
Maybe he is the roast master.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.138
- Yeah, in the comedy circles,
I get a lot of respect.

10:06.238 --> 10:09.175
- You guys ready
for some wholesome comedy? Huh?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.611
- Yes. What a night.
- Incredible.

10:11.677 --> 10:14.480
- Yeah. Yeah.
How 'bout some clean jokes?

10:14.580 --> 10:16.983
Well, here's your guy.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.618
The sweetest, cleanest,

10:18.684 --> 10:21.187
nicest guy in the game,
here he comes.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.824
Give it up for Glenn Hubert.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.863
-
Hi. Hi, everyone.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.633
I went to church this morning.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.102
What's up with these pews?

10:36.168 --> 10:39.672
Why are they always
made of wood?

10:39.772 --> 10:42.141
Eh?
Ever hear of cushions?

10:42.208 --> 10:43.876
C'mon.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.812
- So him just saying the word
"cushions" is the punchline?

10:46.879 --> 10:48.881
- Look at the principal.
He really loves this guy.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.049
- Look at his eyes.
I've never seen him

10:50.149 --> 10:51.450
light up like that before.

10:51.517 --> 10:52.985
- I've never seen a guy
laugh like this.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.321
- You know what ruffles
my feathers?

10:55.388 --> 10:56.722
Pudding.

10:56.822 --> 11:00.893
It's not quite ice cream
but not quite custard.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.530
C'mon, pudding.
Make a decision.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.400
- Not a great joke.
- Look, I like to tease.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.468
But let's take it down a notch.

11:09.535 --> 11:14.040
I understand we have a special
guest in the audience.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.742
He's always wanted
to see me live,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.711
and tonight he gets his wish.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.913
Where is the little guy?
Don't be shy.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.415
- Right here.
- Oh.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.883
This is the guy.
- Right here, right here. Look.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.718
- Wait. This is him?

11:25.818 --> 11:28.254
I was told this is
the Make-A-Wish thing

11:28.354 --> 11:31.023
for a little kid.
- Oh, no, I never said that.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.592
- You clearly said my pal.
I thought it was him.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.761
- If I said my pal,
I meant princi-pal.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.496
- Princi what?
- You can't spell principal

11:37.563 --> 11:39.065
without pal.
- What the hell does that mean?

11:39.165 --> 11:40.933
- He's not a kid.
He's, like, in his early 50s.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.601
- 46.
- Folks,

11:42.702 --> 11:46.906
there's always
one asshole in the crowd,

11:47.006 --> 11:48.441
and here he is.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.010
- Wait. I'm actually, like,
your biggest fan.

11:51.077 --> 11:55.347
- I tried to do a clean act,
folks, but fuck this guy.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.283
- Glenn, please,
this is a special night.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.784
- Oh, it's a special night?

11:58.884 --> 12:02.088
In that case,
have a drink on me, asshole!

12:02.188 --> 12:04.457
- C'mon, that was uncalled for.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.126
-
- Oh, no, not the crotch.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.427
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.196
- Hey, don't touch me.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.698
I still need to cross this
off my list.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.100
- Look, if we need
a replacement,

12:14.200 --> 12:15.768
I was on the shortlist
for roast master.

12:15.868 --> 12:19.138
See what you think of this.
What's up with Tom's mom?

12:19.238 --> 12:21.574
- Nelson, no.
- Always with the flip flops.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.410
You live in New Jersey, biatch.
Buy some shoes.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.479
Am I right?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.913
- Wow, he is good.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.281
If he'd have been
the roast master,

12:29.381 --> 12:32.551
we would have avoided
so many problems.
