01:42.870 --> 01:44.672
- THE TIME OF PRANKS IS UPON US.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.840
- AND AS LAST YEAR'S VICTOR,

01:46.874 --> 01:49.377
I MUST NOW LET
ALL YEE COMPETITORS

01:49.410 --> 01:51.379
CHALLENGE ME FOR YONDER CROWN.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.681
- AHH, IT SEEMS LIKE
IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY

01:53.714 --> 01:55.649
THAT WE MADE THAT CROWN
IN ART CLASS.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.286
- THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.454
"IF YE IS PRANKED,
YE IS OUT."

02:00.488 --> 02:03.657
THE LAST MAN TO GO UNPRANKED
BECOMES LORD HIGH KING

02:03.691 --> 02:06.160
AND WINS THE CROWN.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.396
- AND THIS YEAR,
I AM PLAYING.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.530
- PLAYING?

02:09.563 --> 02:12.200
KATIE,
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.701
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG AND TOO GIRL.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.870
- AND NO GIRL SHALL PLAY,

02:16.904 --> 02:22.310
SO SAYETH
LORD PRANKERTON'S BOOK OF RULE.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.478
- YOU GUYS MADE THIS
WHOLE THING UP IN MIDDLE SCHOOL,

02:24.512 --> 02:26.847
AND THAT IS A PICTURE
OF SIR WALTER RALEIGH.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.349
[together]
BLASPHEMY!

02:28.382 --> 02:31.419
- KATIE, THIS COMPETITION
CAN GET VERY UGLY,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.721
AND IF YOU GET HURT,
MOM WILL KILL ME.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.659
- THIS IS NOT OVER.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.261
- VERY WELL.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.196
EACH COMPETITOR GETS TWO HOURS
TO PREPARE

02:42.230 --> 02:47.435
FOR THE PRANKING COMMENCES
AT...NOON.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.637
- WHOA.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.638
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.839
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.840
I'VE GOT TO CALL MY GRANDMA.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.377
- YOUR LOSS.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.945
- AND BY "GRANDMA,"
I MEAN,

02:57.978 --> 03:01.582
"I WILL BE LORD OF THE PRANKS."

03:01.615 --> 03:03.284
- THE GUYS ARE LATE,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.885
AND THEY'RE NOT PICKING UP
THEIR CELL PHONES.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.954
- OH, THAT'S 'CAUSE I GAVE THEM
THE DAY OFF FOR PRANKING.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.222
- WHAT?

03:08.256 --> 03:09.723
WE'VE GOT A TON OF WORK TO DO.

03:09.757 --> 03:13.827
- KELLY, PRANKS ARE A RITE
OF PASSAGE FOR THE YOUNG MALE.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.363
- REALLY?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.631
I CAN'T WAIT TO NOT HEAR ANYMORE
OF THIS STORY.

03:17.665 --> 03:22.670
- FINE, NOW PLEASE BE USEFUL
AND GET ME SOME SUGAR

03:22.703 --> 03:24.872
FOR MY COFFEE.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.841
THANK YOU.

03:32.346 --> 03:37.518
THE SUGAR PACKET PILE-ON,
A GUSTAVO ROCQUE CLASSIC.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.688
YOU GOT PRANKED.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.924
- WHEN THE GUYS RETURN AT NOON,
THEY'LL SEEK REFRESHMENT.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.726
THEY'LL SEE MY FREE SMOOTHIES,

03:45.759 --> 03:47.861
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW
IS IN EACH SMOOTHIE

03:47.895 --> 03:51.432
IS A HIDDEN BALLOON FILLED
WITH 120 POUNDS

03:51.465 --> 03:56.003
OF PURE NITROUS OXIDE PRESSURE.

03:56.036 --> 04:00.040
THEN THEY'LL PICK UP
THE NEEDLE-SHARPENED STRAW,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.377
PUSH THE STRAW DOWN
INTO THE SMOOTHIE, THEN BOOM,

04:03.411 --> 04:06.013
THE CROWN WILL BE MINE.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.014
AHH!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.316
AHHH!

04:08.349 --> 04:10.284
AHHH! AHH!

04:10.318 --> 04:12.420
- IS THIS ABOUT
THAT STUPID CROWN

04:12.453 --> 04:13.554
YOU GUYS MADE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.289
- I CAN'T SEE!

04:15.323 --> 04:16.357
I CAN'T SEE.
I CAN'T SEE.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.891
- COME ON.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.893
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE DOCTOR.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.695
- BEAR SUIT,
INTERESTING.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.531
- THE CROWN WILL BE MINE.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.500
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT GIRLS
NOT BEING GOOD AT PRANKS?

04:26.534 --> 04:27.935
- NEVER SAID THAT.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.871
I JUST SAID IT COULD GET UGLY,
AND GIRLS COULD GET HURT.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.574
- SO YOU'RE SAYING GIRLS
ARE NOT AS TOUGH AS GUYS.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.644
- HEH, HAVE YOU SEEN THE BEAR
STANDING NEXT TO ME?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.946
THIS COMPETITION GETS SCARY.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.983
- [growling]

04:43.016 --> 04:44.885
- SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE SCARED

04:44.918 --> 04:47.655
OF GETTING YOUR BUTTS BEAT
BY A BUNCH OF GIRLS.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.894
- WHAT,
TEN AGAINST FOUR?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.063
YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.800
[together]
WE'RE IN.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.635
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN...

05:01.669 --> 05:02.903
HEY, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE STILL ONE SHORT.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.374
- I'M IN TOO.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.975
WHAT?

05:08.008 --> 05:11.579
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
BUT I WILL DEFEND MY GENDER.

05:11.612 --> 05:17.084
- SO BE IT AS REIGNING SIR
HIGH KING LORD OF THE PRANKS,

05:17.117 --> 05:21.455
I NOW DECLARE THIS
A MEGAPRANKETITION.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.657
[cheers and applause]

05:23.691 --> 05:26.360
[clock chiming]

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
BUG OUT.

05:27.961 --> 05:32.633
- WHOO!

05:32.666 --> 05:35.369
- LACES TIED TOGETHER,
CLASSIC.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.138
- SO THAT'S THREE BOYS DOWN...

05:38.171 --> 05:40.641
- AND THREE TO GO.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.642
[together]
BOO.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.976
- OHH!
- AHH!

05:47.648 --> 05:50.851
- OKAY, NEW PLAN:
WE LAY OFF EACH OTHER

05:50.884 --> 05:53.053
UNTIL WE PRANK ALL THE GIRLS.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.455
- YES,
AN ALLIANCE.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.723
- SO IT'S AGREED.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.426
WE ELIMINATED THE GIRLS,
THEN THE OTHER GUYS,

05:58.459 --> 06:01.762
UNTIL IT'S JUST THE FOUR OF US.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.497
- MAKE THAT THREE.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.666
- LOOKS LIKE LOGAN
PRANKED HIMSELF AGAIN THIS YEAR.

06:05.699 --> 06:10.003
[together]
YEP.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.507
- THERE,
ALL BETTER.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.508
- AHH!

06:14.542 --> 06:15.709
EVERYTHING LOOKS PINK.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.977
- I'M A DOCTOR.

06:17.010 --> 06:21.649
I CAN FIX THIS.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.750
- [groans]

06:22.783 --> 06:24.051
NOW EVERYTHING LOOKS BLUE.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.554
- WELL,
WHAT COLOR DO YOU WANT?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.188
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
ALL OF THEM?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.958
- [sighs]

06:35.929 --> 06:36.930
- HUH?
- OH, THERE WE GO.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.466
THAT'S BETTER.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.535
- OKAY, BYE.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.671
- AREN'T YOU GONNA PRESCRIBE ME
SOME SALINE DROPS

06:43.704 --> 06:45.639
TO SOOTHE MY ITCHY
AND IRRITATED EYES?

06:45.673 --> 06:48.476
- LOGAN, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
OF BECOMING A DOCTOR,

06:48.509 --> 06:50.944
BECAUSE YOU LOOK AND TALK
LIKE A DOCTOR.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.213
- OH, HE'S ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR,

06:53.246 --> 06:54.848
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.617
DID YOU KNOW
THAT A DAILY 20-MINUTE WALK

06:56.650 --> 06:59.453
INCREASES WEIGHT LOSS,
EYESIGHT, AND MUTANT POWERS?

06:59.487 --> 07:03.090
- HUH.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.959
[together]
WE HAVE FIRST-DEGREE RUG BURNS.

07:05.993 --> 07:09.162
- OOH,
I'VE GOT JUST THE THING.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.465
[electric saw whirring]

07:11.499 --> 07:15.168
- OHH,
SHOULDN'T WE JUST UNTIE THEM

07:15.202 --> 07:17.170
AND GIVE THEM SOME TOPICAL CREAM
FOR THE ABRASIONS?

07:17.204 --> 07:21.041
- YEAH,
THAT WILL WORK TOO.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.612
- KELLY, GRIFFIN IS COMING
TO GET THESE CONTRACTS.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.013
WHERE IS MY PEN?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.981
- CHECK THE UPPER
RIGHT HAND DRAWER.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.121
- WELL-PLAYED.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.224
LET'S END IT NOW
WHILE IT'S EVEN.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.027
- AGREED.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.500
- HERE AT
RCM/CBT GLOBALNET/SANYOID,

07:46.534 --> 07:49.202
WE HAVE S STRICT
NO PRANKING POLICY.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.072
- [mumbling]

07:52.105 --> 07:53.774
- I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU,
GUSTAVO,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.143
BECAUSE YOUR MOUTH
IS TAPED SHUT,

07:56.176 --> 07:58.011
WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING
TO STAY HERE

07:58.045 --> 07:59.947
AND HELP YOU STOP
YOUR PRANKING WAYS.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.984
- [grumbling]

08:04.017 --> 08:05.619
- LIP BALM.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.187
FREE LIPTASTIC SAMPLES?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.090
[together]
FREE SAMPLES.

08:10.123 --> 08:15.228
I LOVE LIPTASTIC.
IT'S SO GOOD.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.230
- MM.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.032
MM-MM.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.102
- OHH, DID SOMEONE
PUT FAKE LABELS ON GLUE STICKS?

08:22.135 --> 08:25.305
- YEAH, NONTOXIC, OF COURSE.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.075
- [laughs]

08:31.845 --> 08:33.814
WE WARNED YOU
THIS WOULD GET UGLY.

08:33.847 --> 08:39.019
[together]
MMPH.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.289
- WHY IS THE THIRD FLOOR
COVERED IN TOILET PAPER

08:42.322 --> 08:46.159
AND MY BUTT COVERED IN EGGS?

08:46.193 --> 08:49.329
- WE HAVE NO IDEA,
MR. BITTERS, SIR.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.331
- BYE.
- CATCH YA.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.066
- I KNOW YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.768
[all mumbling]

08:54.802 --> 08:56.269
- OHH...

08:56.303 --> 08:58.305
* YOU GOT PRANKED
YOU GOT PRANKED *

08:58.338 --> 09:01.742
* YOU GOT P-R-A-N-K

09:01.775 --> 09:06.346
- I THINK I CAN SOLVE
THIS PROBLEM.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.347
PERFECTLY TUNED.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.283
- AHHH.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.820
- UH, DON'T YOU THINK
WE SHOULD UNWIND THE STRINGS

09:12.853 --> 09:14.655
AND REMOVE THE GUITAR
FROM HIS HEAD?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.289
- LOGAN,
YOU HAVE A GIFT.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.091
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY
AND BE MY ASSISTANT?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.860
- BUT I DON'T HAVE
A MEDICAL LICENSE.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.296
- THEN I'LL DEPUTIZE YOU.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.966
YOU ARE NOW A DEPUTY DOCTOR.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.104
[electric saw whirring]

09:31.138 --> 09:33.006
- HEY, MRS. KNIGHT,
DO YOU MIND STAYING A WHILE?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.074
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.809
I AM IN MAGAZINE HEAVEN.

09:35.843 --> 09:39.279
I JUST LEARNED HOW
TO GIVE MY FEET A FACIAL.

09:39.312 --> 09:44.151
- HMM.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.219
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR EACH OTHER'S JOBS,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.656
I'M RECOMMENDING
THE ROLE REVERSAL METHOD,

09:48.689 --> 09:52.960
THE CLASSIC CORPORATE EXERCISE
THAT TEACHES MUTUAL RESPECT.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.862
- SO ALL I HAVE TO DO ALL DAY
IS WRITE SONGS

09:54.895 --> 09:56.730
WITH THE WORD "GIRL" IN IT
AND SCREAM A LOT?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.632
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE DOES.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.033
- I DO THIS.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.034
- OHH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.169
- MANDATORY.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.305
THE ROLE REVERSAL
IS NOW MANDATORY.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.874
- FINE.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.911
OH, GUSTAVO,
GRIFFIN WANTS HIS DEMOS NOW,

10:10.944 --> 10:14.014
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.883
- KELLY,
GO GET THE DOGS.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.817
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.118
AHHHHH.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.721
- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

10:20.754 --> 10:24.424
- SEE?
ISN'T THIS BETTER?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.893
- THE PIE-A-PULT.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.928
THE GUYS GET OFF THE ELEVATOR

10:27.961 --> 10:29.429
TO RUSH THE APARTMENT
FOR SHELTER...

10:29.462 --> 10:32.065
- THEY'LL TRIP ON THE WIRE
AND GET A FACE FULL

10:32.099 --> 10:35.202
OF CREAMY DEFEAT.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.370
- BOYS ARE STUPID.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.438
- THE PIE-A-PULT?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.907
THAT IS STUPID.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.274
- BRILLIANT.
- I KNOW.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.111
- OKAY, BUT NOW WE TURN
THE TABLES ON THEM,

10:44.144 --> 10:46.814
AND THEN THE PRANKERS
BECOME THE PRANKIES.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.883
LET'S GO.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.787
- NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HIDE
AND WATCH THE SHOW.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.122
[together]
BOO.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.692
- [screams]

10:58.726 --> 11:00.994
- OH, SWEET.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.229
GOTCHA.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.998
- [sobbing]

11:08.401 --> 11:11.171
- HEY, WE TOLD YOU
THAT PRANKING WAS DANGEROUS.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.340
- WELL,
DOES YOUR LORD PRANKERTON

11:13.373 --> 11:15.809
SAY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE IS OKAY?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.711
- NO, HE DOES.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.112
IT'S CALLED THE LOGAN AMENDMENT.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.214
- LET'S GO.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.716
- [sobbing]

11:22.750 --> 11:26.053
- CAMILLE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:26.086 --> 11:27.187
- [laughing]

11:27.220 --> 11:31.058
- SHE STOPPED CRYING.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.127
- IT WAS MY IDEA
TO SACRIFICE ONE OF US

11:34.161 --> 11:36.897
SO WE COULD TAKE OUT
ALL OF YOU.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.271
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

11:44.304 --> 11:45.773
- YEP...
[together] WE'RE DOOMED.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.081
- THEY LOOK SO CUTE
WHEN ALL HOPE IS LOST.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.250
- READY, AIM...

11:57.284 --> 12:02.055
- DOGS, I AM KELLY TODAY--
LONG STORY--

12:02.089 --> 12:05.092
SO...STUDIO, NOW.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.894
[together]
HUMAN SHIELD.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.495
- AHH, AHH!

12:08.528 --> 12:10.397
AHH! UGH!

12:15.102 --> 12:16.536
AHH!

12:16.569 --> 12:19.406
AUUUGH.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.142
- HEY, THANKS AGAIN FOR THE
DAY OFF FOR PRANKING, GUSTAVO.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.912
- I'M KELLY.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.549
[together]
SO CLOSE.

12:29.582 --> 12:34.421
- [growling]

12:34.454 --> 12:39.192
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
A TOTAL LOSS.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.562
- EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE PIE.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.097
- I CAN FIX THIS,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.834
BUT YOU MAY FEEL
A SMALL PINCH.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.035
[electric saw whirring]

12:48.068 --> 12:49.002
- NO.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.571
OKAY,
NO SURGICAL SAW.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.440
- LOGAN,
I GOT THAT THING TWO DAY AGO,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.242
AND I'D LIKE TO USE IT.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.912
- JUST CLEAN YOUR EAR
WITH SOME MOIST COTTON SWABS,

12:58.946 --> 13:00.380
AND SLEEP
ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE TONIGHT

13:00.413 --> 13:01.949
TO DRAIN ANY EXCESS FLUID,
OKAY?

13:01.982 --> 13:05.853
- THANK YOU.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.555
- LOGAN,
I'M WRITING YOU A PRESCRIPTION

13:08.588 --> 13:12.359
FOR 100 CCs OF "YOU NEED TO
FOCUS ON BECOMING A DOCTOR..."

13:12.392 --> 13:14.061
NOW.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.528
- BUT I'M KIND OF
IN A BAND NOW.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.865
- BEING A DOCTOR
IS JUST LIKE BEING IN A BAND.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.334
THERE'S COOL CARS, HOT CHICKS,
BUT INSTEAD OF A MICROPHONE,

13:21.368 --> 13:25.472
YOU'RE HOLDING LIFE AND DEATH
IN YOUR HANDS.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.308
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.843
OKAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH THINKING.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.844
BRING ME THE NEXT PATIENT.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.046
- OKAY.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.485
- OKAY,
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,

13:38.518 --> 13:41.121
THERE ARE SIX GIRLS
AND FIVE GUYS LEFT,

13:41.154 --> 13:43.490
US, JETT, AND THAT KID
WHO SMELLS LIKE CORN CHIPS.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.560
- YEAAAHH!

13:47.594 --> 13:49.596
- OKAY,
JUST US AND JETT.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.131
- I'M FREAKING OUT.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.332
THESE GIRLS
ARE WAY TOO POWERFUL.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.201
- LOOK,
WE'VE GOT TO SPLIT UP.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.469
WE ARE TOO BIG
OF A TARGET TOGETHER.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.138
AFTER WE TAKE OUT THE GIRLS,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.540
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR MANLY BATTLE TOGETHER.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.077
GOOD LUCK,
KNIGHTS OF PRANKDOM.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.980
- MOVE OUT.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.053
- OR WE LET KENDALL PRANK
ALL THE GIRLS HIMSELF

14:13.086 --> 14:15.422
WHILE WE LAY LOW
AND STAY UNPRANKED.

14:15.455 --> 14:19.392
- THAT'S JUST WHAT I
WAS THINKING.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.429
- BUT YOU FORGOT ONE THING.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.998
I TAKE YOU OUT NOW
AND BATTLE KENDALL LATER,

14:25.032 --> 14:28.535
'CAUSE YOU JUST FELL
INTO MY SELTZER TRAP.

14:28.568 --> 14:32.572
- YOU MEAN, YOU JUST FELL
RIGHT INTO MY ROPE SNARE.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.109
- TOUCHE, OLD FRIEND.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.544
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU,
BUDDY.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.446
- AHH...OOH.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.916
[together]
AHH, OOH, OOH, COME ON.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.317
- AHH!

14:44.351 --> 14:45.318
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:45.352 --> 14:46.987
I WANT ANSWERS NOW.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.421
- I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.257
I'M BOUND BY LORD PRANKERTON'S
CODE OF SILENCE.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.959
- [sighs]

14:51.992 --> 14:54.227
I'LL GIVE YOU PRIORITY COMMANDER
RESERVATIONS AND VIP PARKING.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.395
- IT WAS ALL KENDALL'S FAULT.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.529
HE'S THE LORD HIGH KING,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.265
AND HE FORCED US ALL
INTO A PRANK WAR,

14:58.298 --> 15:01.468
AND THEY'LL KEEP PRANKING
UNTIL ONLY ONE IS LEFT.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.237
[farting noise]

15:06.706 --> 15:09.009
YOU PRANKED ME.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.543
I'M OUT.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.081
- NOBODY MESSES UP MY PALMWOODS,
AND NOBODY MESSES WITH ME.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.118
- * GIRL

15:18.151 --> 15:22.055
* OHH-OHH-OHH GIRL

15:22.089 --> 15:24.424
- YEAH, SO THE DOGS
AREN'T AVAILABLE TODAY.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.227
- SEE HOW HARD MY JOB IS,
UNLIKE YOURS...

15:27.260 --> 15:29.562
* WHICH IS SO EASY

15:29.596 --> 15:32.699
WHERE'S MY COFFEE?

15:32.732 --> 15:36.603
THIS IS THE WORST COFFEE EVER.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.272
- YES, IT IS,

15:39.306 --> 15:42.642
BUT NOW IT'S SONG TIME.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.412
- YEAH,
LET'S HEAR YOUR ROCKIN' SONG,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.380
WHICH IS SO EASY TO DO.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.082
[knuckle cracking]

15:49.116 --> 15:53.720
- * GIRL IF I HAD YOU GIRL

15:53.753 --> 15:57.090
* THEN WE WOULD BE MY GIRL

15:57.124 --> 15:59.759
* AND WE'D GO ON A DATE

15:59.792 --> 16:03.530
* OOH-OOH-OOH GIRL

16:03.563 --> 16:06.533
- [laughs]

16:06.566 --> 16:10.370
THAT IS THE WORST SONG
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.505
[laughs]

16:12.539 --> 16:14.474
OHH.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.544
- AND YOU CAN'T PUNCH BACK,
BECAUSE I'M A GIRL.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.179
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.780
YOU'RE GUSTAVO.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.183
- RIGHT.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.118
AHH!
JUSTIN BIEBER!

16:25.152 --> 16:27.587
- HUH?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.557
BIEBER.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.063
- HA.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.138
[loud explosion
and girls screaming]

16:45.172 --> 16:47.707
- [clucking]

16:47.740 --> 16:51.511
- FOUR DOWN,
TWO TO GO.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.747
- LOOKING FOR ME?

16:54.781 --> 16:58.418
- IF THE PRANK BATTLE LASTS
BEYOND 6:00 P.M...

16:58.451 --> 17:02.089
- ANY DEVICE CAPABLE
OF DIRECTLY APPLYING MESS,

17:02.122 --> 17:05.692
SLAP,
OR PAIN COUNTS AS A PRANK.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.094
- THE CARLOS CLAUSE.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.196
HE REFUSED TO SKIP DINNER
TO PLAY.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.664
- AND YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
EMPTY-HANDED.

17:11.698 --> 17:16.103
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.304
IT'S ROTTEN MILK.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.106
- ME TOO.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.207
[sniffs]

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
IT'S KIND OF GROSSING ME OUT.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.043
- I TOLD YOU THIS BATTLE
WOULD GET NASTY.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.683
NOOOO.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.356
- IF THE ONLY WAY OF ENDING
THIS PRANK WAR

17:36.389 --> 17:40.427
IS BY PRANKING ALL OF YOU OUT,
THEN SO BE IT.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.095
WHAT'S THE MATTER, KENDALL?

17:42.129 --> 17:45.798
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN...
A JAM.

17:55.342 --> 17:58.478
DARN IT.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.314
- JO.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.550
- IS IT...BAD?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.352
- IT'S GONNA LEAVE
A NASTY STAIN.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.187
- UGH.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.588
BLECH.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.191
IF I DON'T PRETREAT THIS,
I'LL NEVER GET IT OUT.

18:11.224 --> 18:15.662
GOOD LUCK.

18:15.695 --> 18:19.432
- [cackling]

18:19.466 --> 18:20.433
[electric saw whirring]

18:20.467 --> 18:23.303
- OKAY,
ENOUGH WITH THE SAW.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.273
- LOGAN,
I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THAT,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.141
AND I LOST THE RECEIPT,
SO I CAN'T RETURN IT.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.442
- WELL, I MEAN,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.711
THEY'RE HAVING A REACTION
TO THE FEATHERS.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.413
A SHOW
WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP

18:33.446 --> 18:35.782
AND ANY ANTIHISTAMINE
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.184
[together]
THANKS, LOGAN.

18:37.217 --> 18:41.721
- OF COURSE.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.624
- THIS WAS, LIKE,
THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.893
I HELPED PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.396
- LOGAN,
I'M CALLING UP MY ALMA MATER,

18:49.429 --> 18:51.398
THE DOOGIE HOWSER
JUNIOR MEDICAL PROGRAM,

18:51.431 --> 18:53.466
AND I'M RECOMMENDING YOU
FOR IMMEDIATE ADMISSION.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.535
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BAND?

18:55.568 --> 18:56.703
- YOU'LL HAVE TO QUIT THE BAND,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.271
BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU,

18:58.305 --> 19:02.909
TOE-TAPPING POP MUSIC...

19:02.942 --> 19:05.878
OR SAVING LIVES?

19:11.751 --> 19:14.254
- WHOA,
NOT SO FAST.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.888
- I'M JUST GONNA REACH
FOR A TISSUE,

19:15.922 --> 19:20.327
SO I CAN BLOW MY NOSE.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.328
- WHOA!

19:21.361 --> 19:24.531
[loud rumbling]

19:26.866 --> 19:28.935
[together]
THE CROWN WILL BE MINE.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.245
- SORRY, BOYS,
BUT THAT CROWN WILL BE MINE.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.679
HEY,
CAN I BORROW THAT SELTZER?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.581
- TAKE IT.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.452
- GOOD LUCK.
- THANKS.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.886
- ARGH.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.521
- AHHH!

19:48.555 --> 19:52.925
[both yelling]

19:52.959 --> 19:55.495
- [laughs]

19:55.528 --> 19:56.963
[together]
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.365
- OH,
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING

19:58.398 --> 19:59.832
AS THE ROLE REVERSAL METHOD.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.434
I MADE IT UP.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.436
YOU GOT PRANKED.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.239
- YOU MEAN NONE OF THIS
WAS REAL?

20:06.273 --> 20:09.376
- OH, IT WAS REAL...
REAL FUNNY.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.411
BUT I'M SURE THERE'S A LESSON
IN THEIR SOMEWHERE.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.246
NOW,
ON TO MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.981
WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE SUGAR?

20:15.014 --> 20:15.982
- IN THE CABINET.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.950
- AH.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.661
- WELL,
IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OUR PATIENTS

20:28.695 --> 20:29.762
HAVE BEEN TREATED.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.598
- AND MADE HOMEMADE ICE POPS.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.868
I GOT THE MONEY-SAVING RECIPE
FROM A MAGAZINE.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.737
- REMEMBER WHAT I SAID,
LOGAN,

20:37.770 --> 20:39.439
WHEN YOU JOIN OUR SIDE.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.678
- WHAT'S THAT FACE FOR?

20:45.712 --> 20:48.281
- I HAD A GREAT TIME TODAY
HELPING PEOPLE,

20:48.315 --> 20:50.383
BUT I ALSO HAVE
A GREAT TIME SINGING,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.684
SO WHAT DO I DO?

20:51.718 --> 20:54.987
DO I STAY WITH THE BAND,
OR DO I BECOME A DOCTOR?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.923
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
SWEETHEART?

20:56.956 --> 20:59.359
THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT BEING A TEENAGER.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.361
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.962
- THANKS,
MRS. KNIGHT.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.798
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
JUST WHAT TO SAY.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.534
- [sighs]

21:07.567 --> 21:09.802
I DO NOW.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.575
- WHO GOT YOU?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.311
[together]
WHO DO YOU THINK?

21:18.345 --> 21:22.682
