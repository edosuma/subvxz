WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:05.305
The president has had a stroke.
What happens now? Do I take the oath?

00:05.372 --> 00:07.374
We need you to resign.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.310
If you can't deliver,
then maybe you should step aside.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.646
This is what we do.
We do the right thing.

00:12.712 --> 00:15.048
You want to be president
because you want power.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.317
- That's not me.
- Well, that's the problem!

00:17.384 --> 00:20.320
I am gonna go out there
and take the oath of office.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.023
The president of the United States!

00:27.694 --> 00:29.830
I want you to be my chief of staff.

00:29.896 --> 00:32.833
They don't see me as a spouse.
They see me as an advisor.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.335
Do yourself a favor, Rod.
Stay in your lane.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.637
Templeton is not
choosing my vice president.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.339
Mackenzie needs to show respect.

00:39.406 --> 00:40.841
She's picked somebody.

00:40.907 --> 00:42.909
Warren Keaton. He won't be confirmed.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.778
Not a chance.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.008
[man] Good morning, ma'am.
Good workout?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.109
The best.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.478
You have a meeting
with the chair of AIPAC in 45.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.514
- What should I know?
- He's a hugger.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.184
Anything in the NSC brief about San
Pasquale? It's been a couple days now.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.587
- That's above my security clearance.
- Joan, tell me everything.

01:27.654 --> 01:30.156
Command post's in place,
surveillance installed,

01:30.223 --> 01:33.693
prelim background checks on
all faculty and student body completed.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.496
Big change.
Maybe I should take them myself?

01:36.563 --> 01:38.932
With all due respect,
ma'am, there's no time...

01:38.999 --> 01:42.536
It's not necessary. It's not as simple
as you just wanting to take them.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.604
I'm trusting you with my kids here.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.441
[Nate] Corky!

01:48.508 --> 01:50.210
Corky! [laughs]

01:50.277 --> 01:51.945
- [Jayne] Hey, boss.
- Hey.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.247
- [Nate] Hey, Willy.
- Nate.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.249
That is a magnificent beast.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.085
The congressman flew in
from Missouri to meet.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.022
- I thought a face-to-face.
- It's about Warren Keaton.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.658
I hope you're with me on this, Nate.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.593
I think Keaton's dangerous.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.130
That seeing the horror of the
battlefield actually softened him,

02:10.196 --> 02:13.567
makes him weak on security.
He shouldn't be vice president.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.436
If you're trying to get
on the confirmation committee,

02:16.503 --> 02:18.838
that's a matter of seniority.
I can't help you.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.640
Hey, that's not why I'm here, Nate.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.910
Congressman served with
General Keaton in the Gulf. Strat-ops.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.146
He was in a unique position
to hear things.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.749
More than hear.
We became friends. He confided in me.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.452
So, you want to be a patriot,

02:32.519 --> 02:36.489
make sure the committee is fully
informed on who Keaton really is.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.426
Stevenson's not running for re-election.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.461
You want in on Appropriations?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.129
Patriots should be rewarded.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.665
Congressman, it's not that simple.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.801
There have been deals
in place for a while.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.302
He was your friend.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.004
He stumped for you.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.274
He promised me he'd
enter politics as a Republican.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.978
I vouched for him. I promised
the party. And he turncoated.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.946
He made an ass out of me.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.949
He won't be confirmed.
Not with what I know.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.651
Revenge, Jayne.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.988
That's the only motivator
I have any real faith in.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.159
I can't talk deals with you, Willy.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.830
Not personally.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.400
Thank you for coming by.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.138
[Rebecca] Oh, really?

03:25.205 --> 03:28.742
Oh, I missed that part.
Yeah, I fell asleep.

03:28.808 --> 03:32.078
- [laughing] I know.
- [girl on phone] Wanna come over?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.582
Oh, yeah. OK. Let me ask my mom.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.651
All right. Great.

03:39.486 --> 03:43.356
Stacy, um, can I call you back?

03:43.423 --> 03:46.359
Bye, Stacy. Are you hungry?

03:46.426 --> 03:50.230
Um, Mom, could I spend
the night at Stacy's tonight?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.565
Oh, I thought it was a school night.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.402
Yeah, it's just, I haven't
seen her since we moved here.

03:55.468 --> 03:58.304
- We're in different schools, Mom.
- Maybe on the weekend.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.473
- OK, I found her.
- [Rod] Hey.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.742
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning, sunshine.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.912
- Ready for your first day at school?
- Uh-uh.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.048
- Mmm. Dibs on driving.
- Not gonna happen.

04:08.114 --> 04:11.184
From now on, Secret Service
takes you wherever you need to go.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.553
So we're never gonna
be able to drive again?

04:13.620 --> 04:14.721
Maybe at Camp David.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.726
- Amy, what are you eating?
- Chocolate-chip pancakes.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.062
Uh-huh.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.497
[Mac] There you go.

04:24.564 --> 04:27.734
Listen guys, I just want
you all to be prepared for today.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.071
There's gonna be a larger
Secret Service detail covering you.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.373
You'll be paid
more attention by onlookers.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.609
Mom, we've been going to the same
stupid school for two years now.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.879
- Yeah, no one's gonna care.
- That was before Mom became president.

04:39.946 --> 04:44.117
There's a difference. The country
has a fascination with the presidency...

04:44.184 --> 04:46.419
- Madam President. Sorry to interrupt.
- Jim.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.254
- Morning, Jim.
- Hi, Mr. Gardner.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.124
Morning, sweetie.
We're needed in the Situation Room.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.094
Because of that, we're gonna
have to push our prep sessions

04:54.160 --> 04:56.062
for Keaton's confirmation hearings.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.764
I can start those up for you.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.434
Vetted a fair amount
of candidates in my time.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.602
That be helpful, Jim?

05:03.603 --> 05:04.604
Sure.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.440
- We're in the same class.
- Guys. I'll see you later.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.775
- Later.
- [Rod] Good luck.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.346
- This about the agents in San Pasquale.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.914
OK.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.953
Room, attention.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.988
- Madam President.
- What do you have?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.424
I'm afraid, ma'am,
we've had some bad news.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.660
Our nine agents were found
along the San Pasquale border. Dead.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.162
Shot in the back of the head.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.465
We have agents on the ground
with eavesdrop capabilities.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.567
They're working the case.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.441
I'm sorry, everyone, please sit down.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.212
- Are these the agents?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.683
Does anyone know their names?

05:51.484 --> 05:54.154
Ma'am, that's Raymond Carvelli.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.657
- And where is he from?
- [man] Carvelli's from Omaha.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.561
Jeff Reich from Austin.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.964
Martin Hemstead from Naples, Florida.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.635
Samuel Mitroka
from Bridgeport, Connecticut.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.304
James Kaczmarek from Minneapolis.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.406
Paul Wright from Appleton, Wisconsin...

06:24.117 --> 06:26.986
[man] The agents managed
to shut down the Martinez cartel.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.323
They were beginning to make
headway into the Bevaro organization.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.591
How much are we talking?

06:31.658 --> 06:34.194
Two billion a year.
The big drug money's elsewhere.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.162
The government of San Pasquale.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.098
Drug trade doesn't flourish
in a vacuum. We have no proof

06:39.165 --> 06:40.667
and no diplomatic relations.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.369
Not since General Sanchez
initiated a coup a year ago.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.138
There have been almost 200 juntas

06:45.205 --> 06:48.675
since San Pasquale was founded,
borders on a national pastime.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.276
Sanchez toppled Juan Duran,

06:50.343 --> 06:53.680
the first democratically
elected president in years.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.815
[exhales]

06:55.882 --> 06:57.617
I want to talk to General Sanchez.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.320
- Call him directly?
- [Roman] Ma'am.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.889
The leader of the free world
does not give audience

07:02.956 --> 07:04.958
to the unelected head of a thugocracy.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.693
He has to hear it from me directly.

07:06.759 --> 07:11.364
I want him to turn over the person
or people who killed our men.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.801
To us. He needs to hear that from
the president of the United States.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.404
His ego's not gonna
let him do it otherwise.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.840
- Make the call happen.
- [Roman] Yes, ma'am.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.442
[police siren wails]

07:22.508 --> 07:25.278
Basically, you're taking over
the faculty parking.

07:25.345 --> 07:28.648
A portion of it, due to its proximity
to our on-campus command post.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.950
Look, I know you guys
have a job to do...

07:31.017 --> 07:34.854
Sir, our responsibility is to protect
the first family of the United States.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.824
I understand that,
but it's hard enough on my teachers...

07:37.841 --> 07:40.643
Some of whom were found
to have police records.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.564
We've slated those faculty members
for a more exhaustive background check.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.166
Is that...?
Is that always gonna be here?

07:47.233 --> 07:50.670
We anticipate some level
of media exposure today.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.439
Ma'am, I must repeat
my concerns about this call.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.807
You have, thank you.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.257
[beeps]

07:56.542 --> 08:00.580
General Sanchez, this is the
president of the United States.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.981
[speaking Spanish]

08:02.048 --> 08:03.516
[Sanchez] My English is good.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.986
General, I am sure you're aware
that nine American citizens

08:07.053 --> 08:10.023
were found assassinated
on your country's border.

08:10.089 --> 08:14.283
A tragedy. Although we can not confirm
the murders took place in San Pasquale,

08:14.494 --> 08:17.330
I assure you we will
investigate this crime.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.715
Tell me, madam,
these Americans, they were tourists?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.369
This is Jim Gardner, chief of staff.

08:23.436 --> 08:27.206
They were independent contractors
working on the pipeline efforts there.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.976
I'm relieved,
for if these men were spies,

08:30.043 --> 08:32.178
well, that would complicate matters.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.515
But if the president of the
United States assures me otherwise...

08:35.581 --> 08:37.582
General Sanchez, we are very grateful

08:37.650 --> 08:40.186
for your willingness
to investigate this matter.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.621
We would like to send
a team there to assist you.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.357
Mmm, I am confident in my own men.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.127
[speaking Spanish]

09:00.640 --> 09:02.342
Thank you. Thank you, general.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.410
And you, Madam President.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.245
[beeps]

09:06.312 --> 09:08.304
[Rod] I need two boxes from storage,

09:08.481 --> 09:11.050
- both labeled vetting books.
- [Nora] I'll send Louis.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.819
We start the prep at 1:30.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.621
I also need the video
of the vice-presidential debate.

09:15.688 --> 09:19.058
- But the FAPE event is at two.
- FAPE?

09:19.125 --> 09:22.095
- Friends of Art and Preservation...
- In Embassies, right.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.163
We're going to need to reschedule that.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.999
That's been on the books for months.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.602
The Keaton hearing. That's our priority.

09:29.669 --> 09:33.339
Sir, I just don't think that falls
within the purview of what we do.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.775
It does now. You said it yourself,

09:35.842 --> 09:38.978
I am the first first gentleman,
so it's a whole new ball game.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.980
- We get to make up the rules.
- Yes, sir.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.730
- [Grace] Hey, guys.
- Mrs. Bridges.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.284
Hi, Nora, Rod. How are things going?

09:45.351 --> 09:48.488
Well, I'm being run around by Nora here.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.457
Well, we accomplished
a lot together, didn't we Nora?

09:51.524 --> 09:52.692
That we did, ma'am.

09:54.652 --> 09:57.321
I'm just going
to go grab a little breakfast.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.364
OK.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.301
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks, Grace.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.303
I feel so sorry for her.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.873
She was so happy being the first lady.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.812
Uh, Grace, I could use
your help on something, actually.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.781
[Grace] What can I do?

10:14.847 --> 10:17.550
- [Jim] What are you thinking?
- Sanchez did it.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.319
I feel it in my gut.
He had our guys killed.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.523
Where is President Duran
living now? In the States, right?

10:23.564 --> 10:26.267
He fled to D.C.,
to Georgetown, right after the coup.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.760
Good.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.996
Jim, I want to meet with Duran.
Face-to-face.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.399
- What would the agenda be?
- I need his advice.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.003
The people elected him. He knows
the people. And he knows Sanchez.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.171
Done.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.074
[police siren wails]

10:41.140 --> 10:43.342
[telephone rings]

10:44.310 --> 10:47.313
Special Agent Dulcer. Yes, ma'am.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.816
[Dulcer] It's the president.

10:50.850 --> 10:51.851
Hi, Mom.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.820
Oh, hey. How's it going?

10:53.886 --> 10:54.921
We're almost there.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.522
- How's your sister?
- Stuck up.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.091
- Same as always.
- Be nice.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.427
- Pass me over, will you?
- She wants to talk to you.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.834
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.236
I just wanted to tell you
have a really great day.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.871
Thanks. You too.

11:11.938 --> 11:12.939
Listen, uh...

11:13.873 --> 11:16.275
...I was thinking that maybe later we...

11:16.342 --> 11:17.877
Intercepts from San Pasquale.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.179
Um, hey, Mom. Look, we gotta go.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.682
OK, bye. Bye honey.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.183
[Rebecca sighs]

11:24.250 --> 11:28.521
- I'm so not doing this.
- It'll be fine.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.890
- [police siren wails]
- OK, we have a landing.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.625
[indistinct yelling]

11:34.527 --> 11:36.395
Rebecca, let's go. Let's go!

11:36.462 --> 11:38.464
Horace. Come on. Come on. Horace.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.133
[people shouting]

11:40.199 --> 11:41.968
[man] Horace, right here.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.571
[man] Horace, over here! Horace,
what's it like going to public school?

11:45.638 --> 11:49.375
[woman] What's it like in the White
House? How do you like public school?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.245
- Come on, Becca.
- I don't want to go.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.248
It's all right. I'm right here.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.386
I got you.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.695
Do you get along with your mother?

12:09.762 --> 12:12.832
What's it like in the White House?
Do you have a boyfriend?

12:19.038 --> 12:23.309
Sanchez implicates himself
all over these transcripts.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.546
"They keep sending them,
they'll keep dying," quote-unquote.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.281
He knows we're listening.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.550
- He's taunting us.
- He's sending a message.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.819
He's saying, "You work your end
of the street and I'll work mine.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.655
Get your agents out of my country."

12:35.721 --> 12:38.891
We know he's responsible
for the murders. What are my options?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.961
- Sanctions, embargos...
- No, that takes to long.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.964
Those are public options.
Non-public, that's different.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.066
We've used private contractors before.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.135
- Mercenaries.
- Won't work.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.872
One thing Sanchez knows
how to do is protect himself.

12:52.939 --> 12:57.376
So... citizens of our country
were brutally murdered,

12:57.443 --> 13:00.980
and you're telling me
there's nothing I can do about it.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.648
Right?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.785
I want a plan to arrest Sanchez.

13:05.851 --> 13:09.488
To get him into an American court.
And I want it within the hour.

13:09.555 --> 13:10.890
Yes, ma'am.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.192
Morning. Morning.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.662
Morning, general.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.730
Morning.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.434
- You moving in?
- Just set it right there. Thanks.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.502
Our research on you from the campaign.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.439
You can imagine what Templeton
and his committee will have,

13:26.505 --> 13:29.375
given that they've got 300
FBI agents researching you too.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.645
Doesn't bother me. I've taken
a lot of hills on the battlefield.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.747
These hearings
may last maybe four days.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.416
And for that we gonna need
four weeks to prepare you.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.620
Forget it. I'm not sitting
on my ass for a month

13:40.686 --> 13:42.855
practicing what I already
know I'm gonna say.

13:42.922 --> 13:46.259
- And what's that?
- The truth. Just like in the campaign.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.360
Which you lost.

13:47.426 --> 13:50.696
Speaking of the truth, we'll need
to discuss exactly how to deal

13:50.763 --> 13:54.767
with the verbal assaults you made
on the president during the campaign.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.669
Is that what this is gonna be about?

13:56.736 --> 13:59.372
Getting even with me
over what I said about your wife?

13:59.438 --> 14:00.606
Thank you, guys.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.043
- You can close the door.
- [man] Yes, sir.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.878
[door shuts]

14:05.945 --> 14:10.116
General Keaton... you wouldn't have
been my choice for vice president.

14:10.182 --> 14:14.620
But the president selected you and I've
been tasked with getting you confirmed.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.457
That is what I am going to do,
whether you like it or not.

14:18.524 --> 14:23.129
You may know how to take a hill, but
you don't know how to take Capitol Hill.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.965
You have to understand,
Madam President,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.234
Washington is a sensitive place,

14:28.301 --> 14:33.005
populated by sensitive people, vain
people, people who are easily insulted.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.642
I should have been more inclusive
in my vice-presidential search?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.145
Some feathers have been ruffled.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.414
- Yours?
- Me? No.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.016
Not me. No, I gave Jim five names.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.319
I'm sure you gave them
a thorough going over.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.156
But some of my colleagues,
several of them, in fact,

14:50.222 --> 14:52.191
they... [sighs]

14:52.258 --> 14:54.260
They may want to make a show of things.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.594
Ah.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.797
A little bit of,
"Next time she'll remember

14:57.863 --> 14:59.799
which side her bread is buttered on,"

14:59.865 --> 15:01.934
that sort of thing.
You know what I mean.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.836
Not really.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.208
You don't even look tired.
That's great.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.279
You look great. Keaton has problems.

15:13.346 --> 15:17.350
More personal than political,
but problems nonetheless.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.952
- Like what?
- No.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.621
No, I can't. That would
mean breaking a confidence.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.691
But I just wanted to advise you.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.893
Then I am so advised.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.029
Good.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.233
- [Nate] Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.970
Oh, I am correct, Madam President,

15:38.037 --> 15:39.572
am I not, in presuming

15:39.638 --> 15:43.209
that you will meet with the
Gang of Eight over San Pasquale?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.811
San Pasquale?
What are you talking about?

15:45.878 --> 15:48.247
Oh, bloody hell, Jim.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.583
Mr. I Can Neither Confirm Nor Deny.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.551
- I'm aware of my obligations.
- Good.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.654
Because everybody's still a little edgy

15:55.721 --> 15:58.924
after the Nigerian action.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.228
See you all. Thank you.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.397
[door opens]

16:09.668 --> 16:11.771
[door shuts]

16:26.252 --> 16:28.587
- [man] Yes, sir.
- Yeah, yeah, Nate. Come on in.

16:31.757 --> 16:36.362
Oh, boy, oh boy,
was that something, I'm telling you.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.232
I swear, we're gonna pick up three
additional seats in Southern California.

16:40.299 --> 16:44.103
It's a helluva lot more fun campaigning
when you're not doing it for yourself.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.772
You were great out there,
Mr. President, brilliant.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.474
You wanted to see me, sir?

16:50.509 --> 16:54.647
Ah, Nate. I gotta get rid of her.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.716
She's taking meetings
on the Capitol Hill, with congressmen

16:57.783 --> 16:59.785
and cabinet members and governors.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.588
- She's spouting her own agenda.
- That was inevitable.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.623
Stevie Wonder could see that coming.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.723
Well, I...

17:05.790 --> 17:08.093
She's not a lap dog.
She's a Doberman pinscher.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.396
She doesn't like
the leash you got on her.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.064
The stuff you've given her to do

17:12.131 --> 17:16.635
would make Walter Mondale's
vice-presidency look activist.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.439
You need to give her something
she can get her teeth into

17:20.506 --> 17:22.974
without... without making you bleed.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.978
You gotta recognize
something useful in her.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.279
She's a woman.

17:27.445 --> 17:31.517
It's so easy to deal with women
if you just remember they're not men.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.086
I've made up my mind.
I want her out and I want you in.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.492
She-she got you elected.

17:39.558 --> 17:43.329
She's bizarrely popular.
You can't fire her.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.598
It'd be a shock to the system.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.200
I'm not gonna be the fall guy in that.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.135
That's not gonna happen.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.537
Not with my plan.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.108
Oh, you son of a...

17:56.809 --> 17:59.178
You want her to fill
the Talmadge vacancy.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.214
It's what she wanted
in the first place, anyway.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.719
Are you sleeping with her?
That's what it's gonna look like.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.688
I mean, why else would you
put her in the Supreme Court.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.358
It's four to four.
She'd be the swing vote.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.627
You can't do that. She's a loose cannon.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.029
- It's the only way to replace her.
- Well, hell.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.366
I can't be a part of that plan.
No, I'm sorry.

18:21.066 --> 18:24.470
Come on, Nate. It's the vice-presidency.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.907
- It's a demotion.
- Not with you in it.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.110
Just...

18:31.176 --> 18:33.045
Just tell me you'll think about it.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.548
Sure. You're my friend.
You're my president.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.383
[telephone rings]

18:37.449 --> 18:39.652
[man] Mr. Speaker,
may I help you in some way?

18:39.718 --> 18:41.720
No. I'm fine, thank you. Excuse me.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.890
So, what, are we supposed
to ask for your autograph now?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.760
- No, but feel free to buy me lunch.
- Yeah, right.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.762
- You're the one with all the cash.
- Not.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.064
- So, what's it like?
- What?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.866
Living there. Being you.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.768
Not that different really.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.336
- Bull.
- I mean, you know,

18:57.403 --> 18:58.804
other than the help.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.674
[girl] So, like, how many
butlers and stuff do you have?

19:03.409 --> 19:05.177
Six. Plus maids, cooks.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.780
What about a masseuse?
Some presidential...?

19:07.846 --> 19:11.250
- It's not Vegas. Relax.
- When do we get to come over?

19:13.752 --> 19:15.754
Uh, I gotta go, guys.

19:20.459 --> 19:24.697
- Hey, Bec. Want some company?
- Not really.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.616
- [yelling on TV]
- [Mac] They can't do this.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.118
Ma'am, do you want me
to see if I can maybe...?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.927
Well, who's on the desk?
Let me talk to 'em.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.796
Oh, geez. I gotta go.
Hey. Heads up, boys and girls.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.165
- Gather round, folks.
- Madam President.

20:00.232 --> 20:03.402
- We're OTR, OK?
- Ma'am, we're hearing some reports

20:03.469 --> 20:07.072
about some Drug Enforcement agents
who may be missing in San Pasquale...

20:07.139 --> 20:09.141
Guys, this is not a press conference.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.845
Look, I get the appeal of covering
the children of the president.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.748
It's fun. It's, uh, endearing.
It's marketable.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.983
The one thing it's not is news.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.320
Don't you think the press should
determine what is and isn't news?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.223
Yes. I do.
Still, some of you are parents.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.292
And I assume you have
the same rule number one that I do.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.663
And, by the way,
this is not Mac the president talking.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.331
This is Mac the mother.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.502
Don't mess with my kids.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.337
OK, ma'am,

20:38.404 --> 20:40.706
- I think we should...
- Thank you, everyone.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.708
Thank you, ma'am.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.582
[Kelly] I can't be in the
press room and suddenly be hit

20:50.649 --> 20:55.087
with kidnapped Drug Enforcement agents.
I have no idea what's going on.

20:55.154 --> 20:58.190
These people think
I'm hopelessly out of the loop.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.093
- It's classified.
- It's obviously not that classified.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.430
I'm sorry. I should have
known there would be a leak.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.999
I have to be able to do my job.
Part of that is knowing

21:07.066 --> 21:08.600
when to keep her from the press.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.936
[Grace] ...United States
is represented...

21:11.003 --> 21:12.905
What's going on there?

21:12.971 --> 21:16.575
I don't know. She's definitely
raised the bar on squatting.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.643
[whispering] Nora.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.280
- I'll into it with the president.
- Thank you.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.183
- Mr. Gardner...
- What is Grace doing?

21:24.249 --> 21:27.419
This is a Friends of Art
and Preservation in Embassies event.

21:28.087 --> 21:31.423
The first gentleman
asked Mrs. Bridges to cover for him.

21:32.491 --> 21:35.127
You have to help me,
I don't know what to do with him.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.298
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, Amy.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.835
- What's this room called?
- The East Room.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.637
- They do all the fancy events here.
- Like what?

21:45.704 --> 21:49.608
I don't know.
Never got to go to any. Who's that?

21:49.675 --> 21:51.677
That's my nanny. Who's that?

21:51.744 --> 21:55.180
My nanny. My mom's kinda busy today.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.784
- Want to see something cool?
- Sure.

21:58.851 --> 22:03.455
This is wrong. See? It says
"United Sates," not "United States."

22:03.522 --> 22:06.291
My mom will fix that.
She's the president now.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.962
You know,
you're never gonna see her again.

22:10.028 --> 22:13.098
- Huh?
- You just won't.

22:18.937 --> 22:21.440
[Mac] This is the only time Grace
has done anything.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.675
The task may have been
given out of kindness,

22:23.742 --> 22:27.045
but we can't un-ring a bell.
With her showing no signs of leaving...

22:27.112 --> 22:28.180
I'll talk to her.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.315
She's not the one
who needs to be talked to.

22:30.382 --> 22:34.286
- I'll take care of it.
- [telephone rings]

22:34.353 --> 22:35.854
Gardner.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.925
- OK. President Duran is here.
- Good.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.060
Where is he?

22:42.127 --> 22:44.897
- Thanks. He's in the residence.
- [Mac] OK.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.199
Ma'am, Mr. Gardner,
NSC needs you in the Oval.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.268
- Thanks, Vince.
- My pleasure, sir.

22:49.334 --> 22:52.704
Let's see what staff has to say.
Then we'll deal with Duran.

22:52.771 --> 22:55.707
We can find no legal remedy
to justify the seizure

22:55.774 --> 22:58.076
and forced extradition
of President Sanchez.

22:58.143 --> 23:01.380
We have Sanchez bragging about
the murders. What else do you need?

23:01.446 --> 23:03.749
An indictment, which takes time.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.084
It took two years after the grand jury

23:06.151 --> 23:08.554
in Miami for us
to be able to pick up Noriega.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.557
There is little legal precedent for us
going after Sanchez

23:11.623 --> 23:13.592
or any other head of state.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.695
Qaddafi bombed Pan Am
and we didn't try to arrest him.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.230
And that makes you proud?

23:18.297 --> 23:22.434
I'm the attorney general, Jim.
I'm being asked for my legal opinion.

23:22.501 --> 23:26.071
We cannot go down there
and arrest him. End of story.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.908
- Can we block his assets?
- You have the authority under IEEPA.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.711
Sanchez has no assets
to block under U.S. jurisdiction.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.947
Everything he has
is in offshore trust funds

23:35.013 --> 23:38.016
and various front companies
that only Treasury can go after.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.751
- Let's do that.
- That takes time.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.920
Eventually,
the OFAC is gonna go to CIA

23:41.987 --> 23:45.424
and require open records
on intelligence sources and methods,

23:45.490 --> 23:49.428
including illegal wiretaps, and that is
something we cannot and will not do.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.630
We're going
to end up dropping this case.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.900
Are you telling me,
are you seriously telling me

23:54.967 --> 23:56.969
that all my options are exhausted?

24:03.542 --> 24:04.776
There are more options.

24:06.511 --> 24:07.946
Give us a few hours.

24:11.942 --> 24:13.744
I always hoped that my first visit

24:13.785 --> 24:16.989
with the American president
would take place in the Oval Office.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.157
We felt it best to meet privately.

24:19.224 --> 24:21.293
We have reason
to believe General Sanchez

24:21.360 --> 24:23.595
murdered American
Drug Enforcement agents.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.797
My sources tell me this as well.

24:25.864 --> 24:28.901
My team is preparing options
for me as to how to arrest him.

24:28.967 --> 24:32.404
Mr. President,
when this happens, are you prepared

24:32.471 --> 24:35.974
to reassume the office to which
you were democratically chosen?

24:39.378 --> 24:43.015
Madam President, are you planning
on invading my country?

24:43.081 --> 24:44.917
That is not my desire at all.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.120
But somehow, Sanchez
will be brought to justice, so,

24:48.186 --> 24:51.189
again, do your countrymen have a leader?

24:52.157 --> 24:54.526
That depends on your conditions.

24:57.729 --> 25:00.299
Jim, would you give us a minute alone?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.502
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Duran privately,

25:03.568 --> 25:05.203
president to president.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.372
I am available if you need me.

25:13.946 --> 25:17.783
There are no conditions, Mr. President.
This is your country,

25:17.849 --> 25:21.353
whose citizens were deprived
of the leadership they chose.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.990
I only ask that you turn over
to the United States these killers.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.527
They are enemies
of San Pasquale as well.

25:28.593 --> 25:31.196
This all may happen rather quickly.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.298
I would stay in D.C. if I were you.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.200
I understand.

25:38.337 --> 25:43.208
War isn't pretty. And sometimes innocent
civilians get caught in the middle.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.677
That's the sound bite
that will lead the news.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.346
You never served, did you?

25:47.412 --> 25:50.515
That's a great way to endear
yourself to the committee.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.651
Call them cowards and desk jockeys.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.854
You told The New York Times
that then candidate Mackenzie Allen

25:55.921 --> 25:58.690
was dead wrong on her support
of the wall on the West Bank.

25:58.757 --> 26:00.625
- That it...
- Was a form of repression.

26:00.692 --> 26:04.029
Are you about to explain how
you're right and the president is wrong?

26:04.096 --> 26:06.565
I'm about to show how I'm my own man.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.633
That's exactly what they want you to do.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.370
Show that you're not
a part of the president's team.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.005
Finances.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.407
Since you've retired,
you have joined the board

26:15.474 --> 26:17.576
of two companies
that do business with...

26:17.642 --> 26:19.011
That is it!

26:19.077 --> 26:22.647
Everything is an open game here
but my integrity! That is the limit!

26:22.714 --> 26:24.683
The committee could care less.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.153
Believe me, Nathan Templeton
and his bulldogs are just salivating

26:28.220 --> 26:30.989
over the thought of you
blowing your top on national TV.

26:31.056 --> 26:34.226
Which is why I'm gonna let
you take it all out on me now.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.560
Get it out of your system.

26:36.695 --> 26:41.199
Every penny I make from those
boards goes directly to charity.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.968
I know.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.770
But let's talk about your medals.

26:45.670 --> 26:49.307
There are allegations
that some of your citations...

26:49.374 --> 26:51.043
...may have been exaggerated.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.578
Oh, come on.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.415
- Sir. Mr. Calloway.
- [speaks Arabic]

26:57.582 --> 26:59.751
The president wants
a minute of your time, sir.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.189
To be continued, I suppose.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.159
Push up the meetings
with Labor and Transportation.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.960
And the secretary general of NATO?

27:09.027 --> 27:12.330
The only man I know
who can beg in 19 languages.

27:12.397 --> 27:15.734
- Do yourself a favor. Cancel.
- Laura, would you excuse us a minute?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.436
- Of course.
- Laura.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.605
As much as I enjoy the sound
of my own voice, ma'am,

27:20.672 --> 27:22.474
- I do appreciate the break.
- Mmm.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.609
Confirmation prep going that well?

27:24.676 --> 27:28.447
- Your husband likes to kick ant hills.
- He's good. Been through it myself.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.581
[exhales]

27:29.648 --> 27:31.917
So Templeton came to see me

27:31.983 --> 27:36.121
and he insists he has something on
you when your confirmation comes up.

27:36.188 --> 27:40.592
- Did he say what?
- That would spoil the drama of it.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.929
There is nothing in my background
that'd embarrass you, ma'am.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.630
Good.

27:45.697 --> 27:47.199
Templeton.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.337
I'd like to kick his ass.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.808
- Do you have top-secret clearance?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.511
Good. Then I would like
your help with something.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.813
Right here. Right here. Pass.

28:03.448 --> 28:04.683
[cheering]

28:04.749 --> 28:07.986
Stacy, it wasn't fun.
It just really freaked me out.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.856
Really? She transferred to Sidwell?

28:12.424 --> 28:14.159
- Oh.
- [Stacy] Hey, I've gotta go.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.329
OK. All right, yeah.
I gotta go too, actually.

28:17.395 --> 28:19.831
- I'll talk to you later, Stace. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.175
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.543
So, you ever play?

28:31.610 --> 28:33.512
- What, sports?
- Mm-hm.

28:33.578 --> 28:36.548
I was on the swim team in Richmond.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.150
That was a few years ago.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.686
- You don't like it here, do you?
- My friends go to private school.

28:41.753 --> 28:46.525
Probably be a lot easier on you. It's
hard for us to control the press here.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.693
Is that why there's
so many of you guys now?

28:48.760 --> 28:51.029
Yeah. That's why there's so many of us.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.068
Your brother doesn't seem
to mind the attention.

28:57.135 --> 28:58.870
He just gets along better.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.707
Maybe you should talk to her about it.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.211
She's still your mom.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.083
[Jim] The door was open.

29:12.150 --> 29:17.055
Hey, Jim. Boy, uh, he's had
a big life, our General Keaton has.

29:17.122 --> 29:18.557
Find any scandals yet?

29:18.623 --> 29:22.294
No, but we haven't gotten to medals yet.
That's where these guys take a hit.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.995
Right.

29:24.062 --> 29:27.566
Look, uh, things seem to be
coming together in the Sit Room.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.968
- Great.
- I'm gonna take this off your hands.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.437
You can get back
to your first gentleman duties.

29:34.072 --> 29:36.608
What? Come on.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.377
I don't believe this. You're firing me?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.414
- This was just a temporary...
- Does the president know?

29:42.480 --> 29:46.751
The president doesn't need to involve
herself with this kind of minutia.

29:46.818 --> 29:47.919
[phone rings]

29:47.986 --> 29:50.222
- Yeah.
- [man] Sit Room needs chief of staff.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.924
Yeah. He's here.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.393
You're wanted in the Sit Room.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.336
Hello, pumpkin. What brings you here?

30:04.402 --> 30:07.606
I want to show Regal where
my mommy works. Could I see her?

30:07.672 --> 30:10.909
Well, I don't know.
Do you have an appointment?

30:12.677 --> 30:13.745
No.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.115
I'm sorry, honey,
but your mommy's in a meeting.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.417
You're not going
to be able to see her now.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.586
But I'll let her know you came by.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.457
[man] Room, attention!

30:25.523 --> 30:28.293
Everyone, General Keaton
will be joining us today.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.295
- Al.
- Warren.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.766
- Do you have some options for me?
- Yes, ma'am. Colonel Wesley?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.802
Ma'am, we'll run two
sections of F-15E's,

30:37.869 --> 30:40.605
eight aircraft in all,
out of Rosie Roads, Puerto Rico

30:40.672 --> 30:42.774
with a big-wing
strategic tanker en route.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.510
We'll go after the specific
region of San Pasquale

30:45.577 --> 30:47.979
where the DEA agents were held captive.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.614
- Turn out the lights?
- Exactly.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.518
We'll use all tactical capacity of the
8th Air Force, directed by SOUTHCOM,

30:53.585 --> 30:56.087
and shut down every
communication and power grid.

30:56.154 --> 30:59.190
- How does this get me Sanchez?
- It weakens him. His military.

30:59.257 --> 31:02.327
Weakens him? You think the military
is his source of power?

31:02.394 --> 31:04.796
You're aiming at the
wrong munitions plant, Al.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.698
What was it you said
on the campaign?

31:06.765 --> 31:08.800
"A war on drugs is a war on drugs..."

31:08.867 --> 31:10.635
"Is a war on drugs."

31:10.702 --> 31:13.905
If I can't bring Sanchez in,
I will make him irrelevant.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.074
I will take away
what makes him powerful,

31:16.141 --> 31:18.209
what makes the military support him.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.982
Talk to me about eradication.
Massive coca crop eradication.

31:24.049 --> 31:28.353
Talk to me about destroying
all of the drug agriculture, period.

31:30.088 --> 31:32.657
We use several dozen dusters
out of Putumayo.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.226
Hit the country
in a massive coordinated strike.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.395
And we take out
the hidden cocaine labs.

31:37.462 --> 31:41.066
The ones the DEA agents discovered.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.705
It's bold, decisive. You're going
after the drugs. Not the citizens.

31:46.771 --> 31:48.206
I like it.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.577
Get me airtime at 9pm.
I'm going to address...

31:52.644 --> 31:56.881
The Intelligence Oversight Act requires
that you confer with the Gang of Eight.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.552
Then get Templeton and the rest
of them in here. Let's get this done.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.694
We're anticipating the strike
will take about two hours.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.831
And how certain are we
of the location of these cocaine labs?

32:12.897 --> 32:15.066
Very. The DEA team did their job.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.235
- Air defenses?
- [Roman] Minimal.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.871
Suppressive fire
from the A10's will protect us.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.607
Madam President, I have sat here

32:22.674 --> 32:25.577
and listened to five presidents

32:25.643 --> 32:28.580
say that the stakes
were worth American blood.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.115
Is this?

32:31.383 --> 32:34.085
American blood has already been shed.

32:34.152 --> 32:37.088
Some might say a new president,
our first female president,

32:37.155 --> 32:38.423
was sending a signal.

32:38.490 --> 32:43.428
What I'm sending, Alison,
is Strike Force Alpha.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.130
Madam President, it sounds to me

32:45.196 --> 32:48.600
as if your staff has not
made you aware that, one,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.771
all of the farmers in San Pasquale
are coca farmers.

32:52.837 --> 32:56.841
Two, most of the country's
coca crop production

32:56.908 --> 32:59.110
is used for legitimate purposes.

32:59.177 --> 33:02.814
And three, if this attack goes forward,

33:02.881 --> 33:05.817
you will trigger an economic
depression in that country.

33:05.884 --> 33:09.621
And will incur the world's
condemnation for this unilateral action.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.122
Again.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.261
All options have been considered.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.130
I'll be sending all of you
an advanced copy of my address.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.937
Madam President,
I can ask for nothing more.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.906
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:27.972 --> 33:29.808
[Warren] Mr. Calloway.

33:29.874 --> 33:31.543
Ah, general.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.347
- Boy, you've been gone for a while.
- Situation Room.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.950
- Is everything OK?
- It's going to be. Yeah.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.353
I saw something in that Situation Room.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.824
It's not often that I find
somebody I'm willing to follow.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.894
Look, I know I blew it in the campaign.

33:49.961 --> 33:53.298
I didn't listen to people
who knew what they were doing.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.600
I don't want to blow it again.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.937
This is a team
that I want to be a part of.

33:59.003 --> 34:03.808
So I need you to tell me
what I have to do to get confirmed.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.844
And I'm gonna listen.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.346
Mr. Gardner is gonna
be finishing up your prep.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.349
OK. As long as I still have your ear.

34:11.416 --> 34:12.851
'Course you do.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.654
I did serve, you know.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.190
Three years in the Army. Air Defense.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.125
Yeah.

34:21.192 --> 34:24.795
I kind of smelled it on you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.864
OK.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.367
The two of them together
are going to be amazing.

34:29.434 --> 34:30.869
Yes, they will.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.204
Hey, Mom.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.472
Hey, honey.

34:34.539 --> 34:36.040
Um, what's going on?

34:36.107 --> 34:38.543
Uh, I'm getting ready
to address the nation.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.078
Oh.

34:40.143 --> 34:43.748
Hey. Are you OK? I heard
it was kinda rough at school today.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.818
Um, yeah, that's kinda what
I wanted to talk to you about.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.187
Yeah, well,
I've already talked to the press.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.255
Mom, they can't do anything about it.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.757
- Who?
- Secret Service.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.559
- It's public property.
- Rebecca.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.729
Mom, you have no idea
what it was like. I mean,

34:57.795 --> 35:01.599
there were agents everywhere and
people taking pictures and screaming...

35:01.666 --> 35:04.903
I know. I know. But it's not
gonna always be like that.

35:04.969 --> 35:08.540
I hate it there, OK?
I mean, I... I always have.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.744
I just... I want to go
to school with Stacy.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.512
You know, people like us.

35:14.579 --> 35:15.947
People like who?

35:16.014 --> 35:20.084
- Senators' kids, congressmen's kids...
- This is why I can't let that happen.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.753
Mom, please.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.722
I went to public school.
Your father went to public school.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.291
So I have to go to public school,

35:26.357 --> 35:28.426
so you can make
some political statement?

35:29.561 --> 35:30.595
I just...

35:31.362 --> 35:32.764
I have no friends there.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.500
Jenny? What about Mimi?

35:35.567 --> 35:38.136
Mom, don't you care
what I'm going through?

35:38.202 --> 35:39.837
Of course, I care.

35:39.904 --> 35:44.342
Look, it's hard to live
under a microscope. I get that.

35:44.409 --> 35:47.445
And this is not what you signed up for.

35:48.212 --> 35:50.815
I have to get ready for this speech, OK?

35:50.882 --> 35:53.618
Let's talk later. But I promise you,

35:53.685 --> 35:56.821
I will do everything I can
to protect you and your privacy.

35:58.089 --> 36:02.493
Right. I guess you've done such
a great job of that so far, right, Mom?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.898
Madam President, everything OK?

36:06.965 --> 36:10.635
Yeah. Yes. Listen,
thank you for writing this so fast.

36:11.235 --> 36:14.305
Suppose one of these days
I'll have to hire a new speechwriter.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.807
Or press secretary.

36:15.873 --> 36:18.142
Yeah, look,
I know you have to be pissed.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.145
I really have not let you
do your job and I'm sorry.

36:21.212 --> 36:24.515
You are a senior staff member now
and I need to respect you as such.

36:24.582 --> 36:27.018
From now on you will be
included on every meeting.

36:29.053 --> 36:31.356
OK, at some point tonight,

36:31.422 --> 36:32.824
I'm going to go off text

36:32.890 --> 36:35.426
and I want to tell you why
and what I'm thinking,

36:35.493 --> 36:38.730
so when the press freaks out later
you'll know what to say to them.

36:38.796 --> 36:39.964
OK.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.167
- Good evening. Where's...?
- Furniture's in the hallway.

36:43.234 --> 36:46.270
[Kelly] We had to make room
for the camera and teleprompter.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.674
- [man] Thirty-second warning.
- Thank you.

36:49.741 --> 36:53.511
The networks are all in.
They're not pleased, sweeps and all.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.747
Let's give the
president the room, please.

36:55.813 --> 36:58.149
If you do not play a role...

37:00.284 --> 37:02.186
Ten seconds, ma'am.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.322
Nine...

37:05.390 --> 37:06.724
You're good? Text OK?

37:06.791 --> 37:09.794
- Yeah. That's gonna work?
- We'll soon know.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.563
Three... two... You're on, ma'am.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.499
Good evening.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.835
This morning
I was informed that nine agents

37:17.902 --> 37:20.371
working for the
Drug Enforcement Administration

37:20.438 --> 37:23.141
were murdered in San Pasquale.

37:23.207 --> 37:27.078
We have accumulated compelling
evidence that San Pasquale's dictator,

37:27.145 --> 37:31.315
General Joseph Sanchez,
personally ordered the executions.

37:31.382 --> 37:34.419
Using information
provided by the DEA agents,

37:34.485 --> 37:36.554
I have ordered our armed forces,

37:36.621 --> 37:41.526
in conjunction with the DEA,
to destroy coca fields in San Pasquale

37:41.592 --> 37:45.063
and all known
cocaine labs in the country.

37:45.129 --> 37:48.533
This will happen in the next few hours.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.903
Our fight is not
with the people of San Pasquale.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.872
It is not my desire
to destroy an agriculture

37:54.939 --> 37:56.908
that has many positive purposes.

37:58.009 --> 38:02.113
So we will destroy
25 percent of the fields...

38:02.180 --> 38:04.415
- She listened to you.
- ...for the time being.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.718
We will not tolerate a government

38:06.784 --> 38:09.487
in our hemisphere
that is complicit with drug lords...

38:09.554 --> 38:10.888
That's not in there.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.258
...a government killing our agents
and killing our children

38:14.325 --> 38:16.461
with their poisonous drug trafficking.

38:16.527 --> 38:19.464
Until there is a new
government in San Pasquale

38:19.530 --> 38:23.434
which fights drug lords
instead of conspiring with them,

38:23.501 --> 38:27.438
we will continue to act
to protect our children.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.943
In a week, we'll destroy
another 25 percent of the coca.

38:32.009 --> 38:35.279
And then another 25 and then another.

38:35.346 --> 38:40.118
Shortly, the democratically-elected
president of San Pasquale, Juan Duran,

38:40.184 --> 38:41.786
will be in the region.

38:41.853 --> 38:45.156
I encourage the people
of San Pasquale,

38:45.223 --> 38:49.160
seize your right to be governed
by the leader you have already chosen.

38:49.227 --> 38:50.628
- [Jayne] God.
- Bloody hell.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.931
She just called for a coup.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.066
Thank you.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.135
God bless the United States of America

38:57.201 --> 38:59.504
and the citizens of San Pasquale.

38:59.570 --> 39:00.605
We're clear, ma'am.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.278
Thank you, everyone.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.313
[hushed conversation]

39:11.983 --> 39:13.317
OK.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.520
Let me know when
the planes are in the air.

39:15.586 --> 39:16.654
Yes, ma'am.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.029
[reporters murmuring]

39:25.096 --> 39:27.398
[clamoring] Kelly!

39:27.465 --> 39:30.868
OK, OK, obviously,
the president went off text

39:30.935 --> 39:32.804
so we're passing out an addendum.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.673
Did the president call
for an overthrow in San Pasquale?

39:35.740 --> 39:38.042
This president is and will always be

39:38.109 --> 39:42.280
committed to protecting the sovereignty
of democratically-elected governments.

39:42.346 --> 39:45.149
However, the country
of San Pasquale is run by a dictator

39:45.216 --> 39:48.853
who ordered the execution of American
citizens and that will not stand.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.488
Did she call for an overthrow?

39:50.555 --> 39:53.524
President Allen would welcome
the return of Juan Duran

39:53.591 --> 39:56.160
to his elected post
as president of San Pasquale.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.462
[clamoring]

39:58.529 --> 40:01.232
OK. Yes. Thank you.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.036
[Wesley] Sir, the planes
are an hour from target.

40:05.102 --> 40:07.705
And our intercepts
and ground teams are suggesting

40:07.772 --> 40:10.741
that protestors are moving
into the capital city.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.343
[Mac] Hey.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.112
Somebody couldn't sleep.

40:15.179 --> 40:18.282
I told her maybe she could read
down here until she got sleepy.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.318
Of course. What are you reading?

40:20.384 --> 40:23.087
- Robinson Crusoe.
- Uh-huh.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.256
- Did you ever read it?
- Yeah, I did.

40:25.323 --> 40:28.226
But I had to wait till I was 12.

40:28.292 --> 40:30.761
- Anything?
- Not yet.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.098
Kelly, the wires are reporting

40:34.165 --> 40:38.135
that mobs descended on the
presidential palace in San Pasquale.

40:38.202 --> 40:41.639
We need to get the press back.
I'll get a statement from the president.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.375
[man] You are watching
live footage from San Pasquale,

40:44.442 --> 40:47.278
where citizens have gathered
at the presidential palace

40:47.345 --> 40:51.082
demanding the arrest of General Sanchez
before American warplanes arrive

40:51.148 --> 40:54.085
with the mission of destroying
coca fields in the country.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.754
- You're certain of this?
- Yes.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.056
[knocking on door]

40:59.123 --> 41:01.893
- Madam President...
- Shh.

41:05.029 --> 41:06.597
It happened.

41:06.664 --> 41:09.333
The military turned on Sanchez.
They arrested him.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.036
[exhales] Duran?

41:12.103 --> 41:14.705
- He's ready.
- Let's get him in the air.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.742
Already on his way to Andrews.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.344
- Turn the crop dusters around.
- Yes, ma'am.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.246
Oh, Jim.

41:22.313 --> 41:26.083
The F-15s are still authorized
to go after the cocaine labs.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.953
Very good.
