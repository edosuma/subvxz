WEBVTT

00:34.617 --> 00:36.035
Hey, slow down!

00:39.080 --> 00:40.330
That is not cool!

00:55.847 --> 00:57.765
Thank you for coming tonight, Darwin.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.351
This room is secure,
so we can speak freely.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.520
Why the secrecy?

01:03.605 --> 01:07.107
Because the Feds are coming
tomorrow... to shut us down.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.739
Shut us down?
Without even giving us a chance?

01:13.823 --> 01:14.823
Yes.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.993
And there's only one way
we can save this department,

01:18.078 --> 01:20.829
and that's prove ourselves,
in the field.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.719
Our target is Leonard Saber.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.808
As you know, he is a former arms dealer
and current CEO of Saberling Industries.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.437
The Bureau's intel shows Saber
has developed a new microchip

01:45.522 --> 01:48.440
with possible military applications.

01:48.525 --> 01:53.737
They suspect he has sold his technology
to the Far East under the code name...

01:53.822 --> 01:55.072
...Clusterstorm.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.951
Now, Darwin, we need to find out
how Saber plans to use this technology.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.411
Your mission is to download
the Clusterstorm files

02:01.496 --> 02:05.415
from Saber's personal computer
located in his library, right here.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.967
Ben, we're gonna get you that evidence.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.427
We'll prove, once and for all,
what we can do.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.138
We'll give 'em no choice.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.182
They'll have to keep the program
and make us special agents.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.853
Look, I believe in you,
but ifwe fail...

02:25.937 --> 02:28.689
...we blow a case they've been
trying to crack for two years.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.568
Hey, I'm nine inches tall.
I only see the upside.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.088
Right this way, sir.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.090
Thank you.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.191
Tick tock, we're on the clock.
Speckles, do you copy?

03:15.320 --> 03:18.614
Ten-four. I read you, Darwin.
Five-by-five.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.199
All communication systems are online.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.328
Status report.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.126
I have a visual on Saber.

03:31.210 --> 03:34.588
He's wearing a $6,000 suit,
$50,000 watch,

03:34.672 --> 03:38.592
and, according to my infrared scope,
Hanes size 36 tighty whiteys.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.804
Saber's about to start his speech.
Remember, the clock is ticking, dude.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.141
Blaster, Juarez, what's your twenty?

03:46.225 --> 03:48.894
Juarez here.
Approaching first objective.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.522
We're ten seconds ahead of schedule
because Blaster is a little hyped-up.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.776
Of course I am.
This is what I live for.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.153
Time to get this party started.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.076
- Talk to me, do we have any activity?
- Southbound is secure.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.036
OK, we're clear.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.748
Darwin, you're behind schedule.
You all right?

04:09.832 --> 04:13.335
- First mission jitters, I guess.
- Do you want to abort?

04:13.878 --> 04:16.254
No, no, it's OK.
I've been trained to do this.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.925
I'd follow you
into a snarling pack of Dobermans!

04:20.009 --> 04:22.219
Oh, wait. I already have.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.388
Now, get your fuzzy hind end moving.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.099
Hold on. There's a civilian
passing through the perimeter.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.227
What are you looking at?
Move along, pal.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.231
Don't worry. I just spotted my way in.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.879
Juarez...

04:59.632 --> 05:02.884
- Blaster, don't drop a pellet.
- Too late.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.477
I'm cool.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.813
Speckles to Mooch. Getting no visual.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.897
Over.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.535
The fly is in the ointment.
Darwin, do you copy?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.912
Yeah, you're right.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.041
Holy foxes.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.877
- What's your twenty?
- I'm in the morgue.

05:49.932 --> 05:53.393
Don't you wish your blowtorch
was hot like mine

05:56.272 --> 05:57.814
Good thing I took shop.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.614
Welcome to my home.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.034
I want you to know how grateful I am
to all of you for, once again, making us

06:09.118 --> 06:12.788
the number one consumer
electronics brand in the world!

06:13.790 --> 06:15.207
Yeah, yeah.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.503
These things are so popular,
I can't get one.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.091
Mooch, focus. Come on, honey.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.135
You're not here for the sweets.
Get back on mission.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.472
For years,
we've been putting a secret...

06:31.224 --> 06:34.976
...into the heart of every member
of the Saberling family,

06:35.061 --> 06:40.440
be it the cryogenic refrigerator or
the new microwave-heated coffeemaker.

06:40.525 --> 06:46.321
A secret which is at the core of
any successful family: communication.

06:52.662 --> 06:58.083
- Hey, Juarez. Race you to the top!
- OK. On your mark, get set, go!

06:58.167 --> 06:59.584
That's cold.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.463
Darwin, the table's set. You are clear
to infiltrate Saber's study.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.091
OK, I'm in.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.056
Clearing exfil route.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.934
- Hey, it worked!
- Of course it worked.

07:16.018 --> 07:20.021
Nothing happens in this house
that I don't know about. Trust me.

07:21.357 --> 07:25.110
In 48 hours, when I press this button,

07:25.194 --> 07:29.865
it will activate a wireless system
we call "Sabersense,"

07:29.949 --> 07:32.868
which will awaken the chips
already in the logic boards

07:32.952 --> 07:34.995
of all Saberling appliances

07:35.079 --> 07:38.707
allowing this coffee machine
to know how much coffee's been used,

07:38.791 --> 07:43.837
communicate with your home computer,
and add coffee to your shopping list.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.593
Now, in addition, Sabersense will link

07:49.677 --> 07:53.638
every old and new Saberling
appliance in existence,

07:53.723 --> 07:59.352
and create one big family!
And nothing will be the same.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.275
Why did they put the Q
so far away from the O?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.906
- OK, I'm in.
- Roger. I'm tracking it.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.160
So what about it, Juarez?
You and me, I mean, you know...

08:15.244 --> 08:18.622
Sorry, Blaster. You know
I've got my eye on someone else.

08:18.706 --> 08:22.667
- No. In fact, I didn't know. Who?
- Darwin.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.752
Why Darwin?

08:23.836 --> 08:27.505
Because he's so...
so not interested in me.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.924
Copy that, Juarez.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.052
- Oh, shoot!
- Keep the comm line clear, please.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.683
- OK, Speckles, I think I found it.
- Thank you, and good night.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.562
Saber wrapped his speech.
Mooch, give me an eyeball.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.901
Christa, I'm going upstairs for a drink.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.694
Darwin, Saber's heading up.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.364
ETA: about 50 seconds.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.116
Copy that.
I'm into the Clusterstorm file.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.040
- Speckles, are you seeing this?
- I see it.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.128
This isn't about selling weapons.
It's about global extermination.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.380
I'm downloading now.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.216
Whatjust happened?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.510
Encryption. Hands off the keys.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.887
- I'm setting up a worm to decipher.
- Mooch.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.766
You have to stop Saber.
Execute delay strategy B.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.119
I'm back in. Commencing download.

09:41.038 --> 09:45.000
- Speckles, you're a genius!
- I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.048
Switching to wireless download.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.218
Come on. Come on!

10:08.691 --> 10:11.067
Darwin. Get out of there, now!

10:11.152 --> 10:13.111
I can't.
The chimney will block the signal.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.196
Come on, baby, come on.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.657
If he doesn't make it,
are you free Thursday night?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.075
He'll make it.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.919
- OK, drop the line.
- Here we go.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.306
Now, Blaster!

10:50.483 --> 10:51.483
Ouch!

10:53.819 --> 10:56.112
Darwin! Your butt's on fire!

10:57.198 --> 10:58.281
Stop, drop and roll!

11:01.660 --> 11:05.830
- We got it. Speckles, exfil.
- Way ahead of you.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.918
I'll be waiting at the entrance
of the... Oh, no!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.337
Oh, my God!

11:13.005 --> 11:15.256
Speckles reports
a large canine at exfil.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.051
No escape. Repeat: no escape.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.970
Hang on, Speckles.
We leave no rodent behind.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.397
- I'm going after the dog!
- Wait, Blaster! Think it through!

11:30.481 --> 11:32.482
There's no time for thinking.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.818
Juarez, Blaster's gonna need backup.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.820
- Got it.
- I'll rescue Speckles.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.282
Hey, meathead!

11:42.451 --> 11:44.119
Oh, did you see that?

11:50.751 --> 11:52.085
Let's go, old buddy.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.966
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Heads up, boys!

12:00.261 --> 12:02.053
Yeah, Juarez! You get him, girl!

12:04.473 --> 12:05.932
We're out of here. Let's go.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.893
Something spooked the dog.
Let's check it out.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.645
Blaster, Juarez, exfil.

12:10.729 --> 12:15.024
By the way, in case you missed it,
I just saved your fuzzy behind.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.068
We should celebrate over dinner.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.821
Hang on, Speckles.
We're going off-road.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.999
Gas!

12:40.342 --> 12:42.260
OK. We're clear.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.180
That was a little heavy
on the smoke, Ben.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.102
Yo, Juarez, did you catch the little
leg twitch at the end of my "death?"

12:52.146 --> 12:54.522
That was acting, baby. I was feeling it!

12:54.607 --> 12:57.817
Yes, amazing.
Tell me you are not part possum.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.738
OK, you can laugh now, but some of
those people back there were crying.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.615
It was like the end of Old Yeller.

13:04.992 --> 13:08.286
Mooch! You made it. Good.
How'd it go in there, guys?

13:08.370 --> 13:12.123
The game's over for Saber. It's all
there. Clusterstorm, everything.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.083
Our training finally paid off.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.878
I knew you could do this.
This is great.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.214
- G-Force!
- G-Force?

13:19.298 --> 13:23.092
I figured we need a name. Like,
you know, Green Berets or Navy SEALs.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.178
Come on. G-Force!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.223
- No.
- The pose is cute.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.270
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah, it's getting there.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.814
Good. Feds won't be able to
shut us down with this evidence.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.902
Does this make me look fatter?

13:42.404 --> 13:45.599
- No. I think you look nice.
- How much longer, Speckles?

13:45.683 --> 13:48.685
Just a few more touches to decode
Saber's crypto-system.

13:48.769 --> 13:51.062
To access the information
on Darwin's PDA,

13:51.147 --> 13:55.275
I have to factor a univariate
polynomial over a finite field.

13:55.359 --> 13:58.987
OK. Hey, do I look fat in this?
I haven't worn a jacket since the prom.

14:00.656 --> 14:03.325
You look very... sharp.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.001
"Because he's so not interested. "

14:13.878 --> 14:18.757
- What does that mean?
- Men are like government bonds.

14:18.841 --> 14:21.426
They take way too long to mature.

14:21.511 --> 14:24.763
But if you're a woman
trying to make it in a man's world,

14:24.847 --> 14:29.309
you have to learn to think
like they do and keep them guessing.

14:30.019 --> 14:31.353
Candygram.

14:32.438 --> 14:33.563
Juarez?

14:36.025 --> 14:38.777
I heard over the wire
that you're interested.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.779
I'm not interested.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.614
That's not what you told Blaster.

14:42.698 --> 14:45.784
Don't you get it?
I want him interested in me.

14:45.868 --> 14:48.620
And he'll only be interested
if he thinks I'm not.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.872
But you are interested?

14:50.957 --> 14:53.124
- Of course.
- But not in me.

14:53.209 --> 14:55.877
No, no, no. Because you know
you could have me,

14:55.962 --> 14:57.796
which makes you not interested,

14:57.880 --> 15:02.008
and that means I wouldn't be
interested in you even if I were.

15:07.723 --> 15:09.599
OK, everybody, they're here.

15:10.226 --> 15:13.853
G-Force, in your positions.
It's showtime.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.314
Hello.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.358
Director Killian?

15:20.278 --> 15:21.403
I'm Ben.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.906
Congratulations on becoming the
new task force director. That's neat.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.408
Let's save the chitchat.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.743
Time is money.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.826
OK.

15:29.910 --> 15:32.370
Many people don't know
that since the Civil War

15:32.454 --> 15:34.705
animals have been used
to gather strategic intelligence.

15:34.790 --> 15:37.291
Now, our work focuses on
developing communication

15:37.376 --> 15:41.254
between humans and animals. Now, these
cockroaches right here have been trained

15:41.338 --> 15:43.965
to carry microcameras
into surveillance zones,

15:44.049 --> 15:47.510
which is, I think, really kind of neat.

15:47.594 --> 15:51.681
Congratulations. Dr. Kendall, do you
mean to tell me that Homeland Security

15:51.765 --> 15:54.684
is financing a roach motel?

15:58.105 --> 15:59.605
This is a rodent.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.651
Guinea pig, sir. Don't say that.
They get highly offended.

16:03.735 --> 16:06.696
You know their DNA is 98.7 percent
identical to humans, right?

16:07.990 --> 16:09.490
No. How would I know that?

16:09.700 --> 16:13.369
So you'll notice the extremely developed
sense of motor skills.

16:13.453 --> 16:16.372
That's because their brains
have close to a billion neurons,

16:16.456 --> 16:17.623
and a trillion synapses.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.459
That's a thousand times stronger
than any supercomputer.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.129
It gives them exceptional, like,
eye-hand reflexes.

16:23.213 --> 16:24.338
It's a video game.

16:24.423 --> 16:28.217
Yeah. And there's something over here...
OK, we'll go over here.

16:28.302 --> 16:30.553
You're really gonna be amazed by this.

16:32.139 --> 16:33.472
It's a language decoder.

16:34.558 --> 16:37.643
It enables animals to talk to humans.

16:37.728 --> 16:41.439
Without it, they sound like
normal animals. Go ahead, take a look.

16:44.151 --> 16:47.028
You're Doctor Dolittle.
You talk to animals.

16:47.112 --> 16:48.529
Talking to animals is the easy part.

16:48.614 --> 16:50.698
Getting them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

16:50.782 --> 16:55.828
- Darwin! Juarez! Blaster!
- So these guys are special agents?

16:56.455 --> 16:58.331
Yeah, just like we're gonna be.

16:59.124 --> 17:03.210
- Hey, how you doing?
- That's impossible.

17:03.295 --> 17:07.757
No, no, no. Finding something that
fits me off the rack, that's impossible.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.093
Think that's something? Check out
Speckles. He's been decrypting the file.

17:11.178 --> 17:13.721
- Who's Speckles?
- Our mole.

17:13.805 --> 17:15.765
Star-nosed breed. Blind as a bat.

17:15.848 --> 17:18.184
IQ off the charts.
He's lucky I found him.

17:18.268 --> 17:21.020
- His family was exterminated.
- We're ready.

17:21.104 --> 17:22.688
Last night, G-Force was able to get

17:22.772 --> 17:25.023
some intelligence regarding
Project Clusterstorm.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.108
You ran a mission
without my authorization?

17:27.194 --> 17:29.779
Yes. We went to Saber's mansion and...

17:29.863 --> 17:32.281
Wait a second, you broke into
Leonard Saber's house?

17:32.366 --> 17:35.576
We accomplished in one night what
you guys couldn't do in two years.

17:35.661 --> 17:37.912
And without a warrant. Holla.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.081
Blaster, cool it.

17:43.669 --> 17:46.545
I knew we were up for review, and I
wanted to show you what we could do.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.756
All right, then show me.
What'd you get?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.299
Speckles, you're on.

17:50.384 --> 17:53.010
- Darwin's PDA contains classified...
- Just open it.

17:57.015 --> 17:58.265
What is it?

18:01.186 --> 18:04.313
- A cappuccino machine?
- What? That's not right.

18:04.398 --> 18:08.317
I downloaded the Clusterstorm file,
not plans for a coffee machine.

18:09.695 --> 18:13.322
- Right computer, wrong file.
- Darwin, what happened?

18:13.407 --> 18:15.574
Specks, show them the Clusterstorm file.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.285
Well, this is all we have. I'm sorry.

18:18.370 --> 18:22.623
No, that's not it! It's about
global extermination. I saw it.

18:22.708 --> 18:27.003
That's it, Kendall. Outside... now.

18:33.468 --> 18:36.512
What a surprise.
The guinea pig mission didn't work out.

18:36.596 --> 18:38.014
I'm shutting you down.

18:38.098 --> 18:40.683
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, I can.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.019
You performed an unauthorized infil,

18:43.103 --> 18:45.646
compromised a two-year
undercover FBI operation,

18:45.731 --> 18:48.024
and came out with the crucial intel
that Leonard Saber,

18:48.108 --> 18:52.069
and stand by for this,
makes coffee machines.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.156
This means we're in big trouble now.

18:55.449 --> 18:56.949
¡Cállate ya!

18:57.034 --> 18:58.909
You have to admit,
I've done some amazing things

18:58.994 --> 19:00.870
as far as animal intelligence in there.

19:00.954 --> 19:05.166
Thanks to you, those rodents can speak.
But sadly that means they're now capable

19:05.250 --> 19:08.127
of exposing the derelict activities
committed on my watch.

19:08.211 --> 19:09.211
- Yeah, but I...
- No!

19:09.296 --> 19:11.047
I'm not gonna take the heat
for this, Kendall.

19:11.131 --> 19:13.716
I'm not going down in Washington
as the crazy gopher guy.

19:15.635 --> 19:18.387
Dr. Kendall's coming with me.
Cage anything that moves.

19:18.472 --> 19:22.349
- Cage? Oh, no!
- What about my team here?

19:23.393 --> 19:24.518
Here's an idea.

19:24.603 --> 19:27.146
Since they're guinea pigs,
why don't we use them as guinea pigs?

19:27.230 --> 19:29.148
- What?
- Oh, no.

19:30.609 --> 19:31.984
Guys, we've got company.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.173
We've got to get out of here.
The document capsules. Let's move.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.009
- Vamos.
- Leave the gear behind.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.344
All right, we're going native.
Lock and load.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.804
I always wanted to say that.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.014
Let's go.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.351
Sorry, Speckles.
Talking animal, dead giveaway.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.022
- No! No, not my glasses.
- In you go. Let's go.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.982
No. No.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.860
It's OK. I'll be right behind you.
Now, Marcie.

19:55.944 --> 19:56.986
Good luck, team.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.406
I love my job!

20:08.749 --> 20:10.458
No! No!

20:11.001 --> 20:14.712
Marcie, you tell Ben
the Clusterstorm file is on that PDA.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.048
- And you tell him this isn't over.
- OK.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.050
What we have here
is your classic case...

20:19.134 --> 20:21.886
- Be quiet. I'll distract them.
- ... and overspending.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.222
- Bye, guys. Have fun in the lab.
- Hey, hey!

20:25.307 --> 20:28.142
- Would you put that down, please?
- Put it down.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.563
It's not working. Come on. Come on.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.693
- It's empty.
- Stealth hamsters.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.320
A special coating on the fur.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.906
Light bends around them.
Renders them invisible.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.574
That is ridiculous.

20:44.951 --> 20:46.327
We did see hamsters talk.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.289
- Now, let me see now.
- Step aside.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.042
What are you doing?
Why are you letting them out?

20:53.126 --> 20:55.002
- What?
- Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.087
I don't see anything.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.339
On the floor...
Be careful not to step on them.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.264
- What was that?
- What was what?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.850
There's no such thing
as a stealth hamster.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.186
Be cool if there were, though.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.029
Juarez, what's the situation?

21:22.948 --> 21:23.948
FBI.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.284
They got the whole lab surrounded.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.538
I'll need to inspect your goods.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.206
Let's go.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.459
Yeah, 20 bags of Falfa Cravins.
Yes, I know.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.132
- We can hide in here. Go, go, go!
- No, not the cage!

21:41.216 --> 21:44.301
This facility's closed.
Get this delivery truck out of here.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.555
- I don't do cages!
- Speckles, let go!

21:50.058 --> 21:52.226
Great. Now we are locked in.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.530
What do you think?
Is this the frying pan or the fire?

22:04.614 --> 22:08.325
Let's all agree right now.
None of this goes on our résumé.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.328
This is Killian.

22:11.413 --> 22:15.666
We're locking the building down, sir,
but the animals have all bolted.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.252
If those animals bolted,
then I got a problem.

22:18.336 --> 22:22.173
I want them all back,
dead or alive, zero exposure.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.092
- Three guinea pigs and a mole. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.148
I've never seen
such fat animals in my life.

22:39.232 --> 22:43.611
Don't they have a gym around here?
A Jamba Juice or something?

22:43.695 --> 22:45.279
Lay off the nuggets, man.

22:46.364 --> 22:49.784
All right, my furry little friends.
Welcome to your new home.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.329
Good luck getting out.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.793
- G-Force!
- Why did you just do that?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.878
I thought it might cheer us up.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.215
You can'tjust blurt it out anytime.
It ruins the effect.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.842
Guys, guys. Cool it.
The world's at stake.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.344
We got to get out of here.

23:08.428 --> 23:11.555
Then what? The Feds want to
turn us into guinea pigs.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.557
They'll never take us seriously.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.893
Well, we did get the wrong file.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.021
No, I downloaded the right file,
and we're gonna prove it

23:19.105 --> 23:20.731
as soon as we find a way out of here.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.068
Well, let's ask that guy.
He looks cute and friendly.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.654
Excuse me,
my incarcerated little friend.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.656
- May I ask you a question?
- Don't move!

23:29.449 --> 23:33.869
All I'm saying is, know your place,
behind this line. That's all I'm saying.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.246
Is he talking to us?

23:35.330 --> 23:38.874
Did someone order a knuckle sandwich?
Because I'm about to make a delivery.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.044
Wow. You talk a lot of smack
for a little guy, buddy.

23:42.128 --> 23:45.089
"Buddy?" No.
For your information, it's "Bucky. "

23:45.173 --> 23:48.617
And if you want to stay alive,
do not cross that line!

23:51.246 --> 23:52.538
Take cover!

23:54.541 --> 23:56.250
The horror! The horror!

23:57.919 --> 24:01.088
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning!

24:01.173 --> 24:03.674
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a quarter ferret.

24:03.758 --> 24:07.094
I have no ferret in me, Hurley.
That has never been proven.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.387
Then why are you marked down?

24:08.472 --> 24:11.765
I'm on sale!
Everyone goes on sale eventually.

24:11.850 --> 24:15.686
This should come as no surprise, but
he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.

24:15.770 --> 24:19.315
- Mice are on sale. Everybody's on sale.
- Enough with the line already.

24:19.399 --> 24:21.859
We agreed this was my zone.
We all agreed that, right?

24:21.943 --> 24:24.904
- Right.
- The mice will agree to anything.

24:24.988 --> 24:27.281
- You guys are all idiots, right?
- Right!

24:27.365 --> 24:29.366
Oh, yeah? Fine!

24:30.869 --> 24:34.455
- Yeah, he's very sensitive.
- Not a ferret!

24:35.123 --> 24:39.335
- Welcome, my friends, to the family.
- Where is the bathroom?

24:39.419 --> 24:41.337
Well, for me, this morning,

24:41.421 --> 24:44.048
the sports page, which is
pretty much where you're standing.

24:44.132 --> 24:46.383
- Nasty!
- Look, don't worry.

24:46.468 --> 24:49.220
They put down newspaper every day,
there's plenty to read.

24:50.096 --> 24:51.388
We don't have time for this.

24:51.473 --> 24:55.726
- Locate escape options.
- OK, here we go. Stand back!

24:55.810 --> 24:59.855
- I'm gonna break the glass.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.735
This might be a good time for a nap.

25:05.403 --> 25:08.864
OK. The truth is my grandmother met
a ferret at the San Diego petting zoo,

25:08.949 --> 25:11.075
but nothing happened.
They simply dated.

25:11.159 --> 25:13.410
My papers say hamster, end of story.

25:13.495 --> 25:15.412
Now stop looking at the line!

25:15.497 --> 25:17.581
Darwin, please let me
pull his tongue out.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.917
Negative. Nobody touches the ferret.

25:20.001 --> 25:21.043
I am not a ferret!

25:21.127 --> 25:24.296
You try to pull my tongue out,
you'll see what happens...

25:24.381 --> 25:25.756
Let's check that lock.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.716
G-Force, Delta formation.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.412
You guys from the circus or something?

25:41.039 --> 25:43.165
- The circus!
- I hate the circus.

25:43.249 --> 25:44.833
No, we're not from the circus.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.543
We're specially bred,
genetically altered,

25:46.628 --> 25:50.214
- and highly trained secret agents.
- Known as G-Force!

25:50.298 --> 25:53.717
I get it. You guys are transfers
from the Hollywood store.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.052
Darwin, it's locked.

25:57.347 --> 25:58.931
We need another way out.

26:00.475 --> 26:04.186
Mooch!
Go find Ben and report our location.

26:04.270 --> 26:07.356
Clusterstorm launch is in... 29 hours.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.899
Wait. Who's Mooch?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.986
- The fly.
- Oh, man. Talking to the flies.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.196
And I thought the ferret was crazy.

26:34.741 --> 26:36.950
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:37.035 --> 26:38.494
What happened in there?

26:38.578 --> 26:40.996
Well, I told them
we shouldn't be shut down.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.457
And then I got to the bit
where I talk to guinea pigs,

26:43.625 --> 26:46.627
- and then that's where I lost 'em.
- Darwin told me, before he left,

26:46.711 --> 26:48.837
that he was positive
he downloaded the right file.

26:48.922 --> 26:50.339
Where is the PDA?

26:50.423 --> 26:53.383
- It's still back at the warehouse.
- Well, we gotta go get it.

26:53.468 --> 26:55.886
Security's probably
crawling all over the place.

26:55.970 --> 26:59.431
- That's all right. I've got an idea.
- OK, what do we do about the G-Force?

26:59.516 --> 27:02.768
They're highly professional. They're
probably halfway back to my house.

27:03.603 --> 27:04.645
Now, Hurley.

27:08.858 --> 27:11.693
Blaster, why don't you
leave the tactics to me?

27:11.778 --> 27:16.990
- OK. No problem.
- So, Farty, how do you get adopted?

27:17.078 --> 27:20.955
It's pretty simple. Act cute,
kid picks you out, takes you home,

27:21.040 --> 27:23.166
and bingo, you're part of the family.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.794
Except that, well, they never pick me.

27:27.004 --> 27:28.296
Incoming.

27:32.802 --> 27:34.886
Huddle up. OK, bring it in.

27:34.970 --> 27:36.763
First, we get adopted. Then we escape.

27:36.847 --> 27:40.475
Ben's house is the rendezvous point.
Now, go act cute.

27:42.561 --> 27:43.895
Who's acting?

27:44.105 --> 27:48.191
Check it out. I'm chasing my butt.
How cute is that?

27:48.275 --> 27:52.862
- Come on, Specks. You, too. Act cute.
- I don't have that kind of range.

27:53.656 --> 27:56.741
Grandpa, what is that?

27:56.826 --> 27:59.327
That's a hideous crime
against nature, I'd say.

28:00.454 --> 28:01.830
I'm outta here.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.708
- What can I help you with, young lady?
- I want a hamster.

28:06.502 --> 28:11.589
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

28:11.674 --> 28:15.677
- Her. With the big cheeks.
- What?

28:15.761 --> 28:18.680
- I could put bows in her hair.
- What?

28:18.764 --> 28:21.474
I'm the hamster. They're guinea pigs!

28:21.809 --> 28:26.438
- Watch the hands, buddy.
- One oversized hamster. There you go.

28:27.148 --> 28:30.275
You try to put a bow on me,
you're gonna lose a finger.

28:30.359 --> 28:33.111
That little girl
has no idea what she's in for!

28:33.195 --> 28:38.283
I'm gonna put nail polish
and lipstick on her and a dress.

28:38.367 --> 28:41.119
A dress?
You're going to lose your whole hand.

28:41.203 --> 28:42.620
Juarez, remember.

28:42.705 --> 28:46.207
I know. Maintain my cover
until I have a chance to escape.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.627
What about that little fur ball there?
He looks like he's full of life.

28:49.712 --> 28:53.839
- No, no. Give me the fat one.
- I'm not fat. I'm fluffy.

28:53.924 --> 28:56.800
Even if you forget to feed this guy
every now and then,

28:56.885 --> 28:58.093
it wouldn't bother him.

28:58.178 --> 29:01.722
- He's a little plump as it is.
- That's probably a good thing.

29:01.806 --> 29:05.935
Oh, mama! This is it. This is it!

29:06.019 --> 29:08.437
- What do these fellas eat?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

29:08.521 --> 29:11.148
- Come on, Penny.
- See you on the outside!

29:11.233 --> 29:15.861
Hey, guys, I can see my future!
It's all cakes and cuddles!

29:19.491 --> 29:21.450
I think he's gonna
throw him in with the snake.

29:37.259 --> 29:40.094
Make way. Hamster coming through.

29:49.229 --> 29:51.230
You're lucky I'm not in there,
snake boy,

29:51.314 --> 29:53.440
because it would've been
lights out for you!

29:53.525 --> 29:56.527
I would've hit you so hard
you would have shed yourself.

29:56.611 --> 30:00.281
Then I would have turned you
into a nice pair of snakeskin boots.

30:00.365 --> 30:03.242
That kid's a monster.
He just lifted him up and...

30:04.536 --> 30:07.538
- Come on, kid.
- Blaster, do something.

30:07.622 --> 30:11.041
- What do you suggest I do?
- Poop in his hand. Poop in his hand.

30:11.126 --> 30:13.294
Hey, Grandpa, changed my mind.

30:13.378 --> 30:17.172
Oh, no, no, not upside down,
not upside down. Hold him like this.

30:17.590 --> 30:19.717
Where did...
Where did the chubby one go?

30:19.801 --> 30:20.884
I don't know.

30:22.637 --> 30:25.389
All right, Specks. We have to think
of a way out of here.

30:26.433 --> 30:27.933
There you are.

30:29.978 --> 30:33.605
I knew you were trouble.
I can see it in your eyes.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.400
At 0920 local time,

30:36.484 --> 30:39.903
Saber initiated a call to the usual
recipient, Mr. Yanshu, in Beijing.

30:39.988 --> 30:43.365
He left a message saying the launch
was on track for Project Clusterstorm.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.575
Since then, nothing.

30:44.659 --> 30:46.577
Kip, our FISA tap just isn't cutting it.

30:46.661 --> 30:49.663
Sir, with respect, if you were
to authorize a search warrant...

30:49.748 --> 30:50.873
On what grounds?

30:50.957 --> 30:54.251
I can't authorize a search warrant
without probable cause, and he knows it.

30:54.336 --> 30:56.086
Saber comes from
the defence supply industry.

30:56.171 --> 30:58.130
- He knows how to cover his tracks.
- Sir...

30:58.214 --> 31:02.426
Just give me cause,
and I can authorize. Keep listening.

31:02.552 --> 31:06.346
- We are listening, sir.
- Son, listen harder.

31:11.185 --> 31:12.436
Careful.

31:14.022 --> 31:16.481
- Come here.
- No, porfavor.

31:16.566 --> 31:20.027
No, not pink. And it stinks!

31:20.653 --> 31:22.946
This has to be against
the Geneva Convention.

31:24.657 --> 31:27.451
Where is Blaster?
We have to get out of here.

31:27.535 --> 31:30.078
I think you need lipstick, too.

31:32.332 --> 31:33.332
The tiara.

31:34.250 --> 31:37.002
Enough already.
This is the tenth outfit.

31:37.086 --> 31:39.004
Don't you look pretty?

31:39.881 --> 31:44.384
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

31:47.722 --> 31:50.265
Let me do this, Specks.
I'll come back and get you.

31:50.350 --> 31:52.934
Relax. They told me
one of the mice died last week,

31:53.019 --> 31:54.644
and was buried in the backyard.

31:54.729 --> 31:58.106
Once I'm in the ground,
I can tunnel to freedom and rescue you.

32:01.569 --> 32:04.571
Terrell! Oh, man.

32:08.868 --> 32:11.870
- Terrell!
- Mamacita, relax.

32:12.372 --> 32:14.289
Está muerto.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.832
It's dead.

32:17.877 --> 32:20.629
- Yeah, you're right. It is.
- Do something.

32:20.713 --> 32:23.006
Wow. This woman's really abrasive.

32:23.091 --> 32:27.344
You get it out of here before
it starts to smell up my shop. Hurry up.

32:28.221 --> 32:31.306
- Just run, take it out back right now.
- I am. It's squishy.

32:33.935 --> 32:37.562
Trash truck.
Let's just get it on out of here pronto.

32:37.647 --> 32:40.941
That's not the plan.
No, no, no. Speckles, no!

32:41.025 --> 32:44.236
Hold it.
Good luck, rest in peace and all that.

32:46.155 --> 32:47.155
Oh, no!

32:48.950 --> 32:50.325
Oh, my God!

32:51.411 --> 32:54.204
No, no, no.

32:59.127 --> 33:01.711
- Is this OK?
- Yeah, this is good.

33:03.172 --> 33:04.297
OK, Harry.

33:08.094 --> 33:09.219
You know what to do.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.502
- She was way cuter than the other one.
- Definitely.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.199
OK, he's got it. He's got the PDA.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.121
What the hell was that?!

34:03.958 --> 34:05.333
OK, I got him. I got him.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.128
- Let's go. Just stay calm, OK?
- I got him. Here he is.

34:09.338 --> 34:12.632
Look on the bright side: at least
you haven't been marked down yet.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.092
What's that on your butt?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.679
It's a birthmark.
Never seen a birthmark?

34:17.763 --> 34:21.558
I have seen that birthmark.
Look at this. I got the same one.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.726
Don't point that thing at me.
It might go off.

34:23.811 --> 34:29.065
Seriously, just look at my butt.
You see? You see? We must be related.

34:29.150 --> 34:33.069
No. I am a genetically
engineered super spy.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.947
Ben spent years training us. We do
things that people only dream of doing.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.493
Yeah. That's what they want you
to think. So you'll do tricks for them.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.913
But you, my friend,
are a common, everyday

34:42.996 --> 34:47.083
pet shop guinea pig just like me.
We must have been separated at birth.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.920
But fate has brought us back together,
my brother.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.672
- Don't say that.
- I have a brother.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.675
- Don't say that word.
- I have a brother! Come here, brother.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.052
Come here, brother.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.389
All right. My brother doesn't like hugs.
I'm good with that.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.475
I am not your brother.

35:03.559 --> 35:06.436
Listen. Darwin,
I'm not gonna dress it up, OK?

35:06.520 --> 35:10.523
I sit here every day
hoping to get adopted, to find family.

35:10.608 --> 35:15.403
And now, because of you,
family has found me.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.823
Hurley, there is no way
that we are related,

35:18.908 --> 35:21.368
so just get that
through your head, OK?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.876
OK. Here we go.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.507
Darwin was right.
The file was marked "Clusterstorm. "

35:36.342 --> 35:38.093
- Can you open this?
- I don't know.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.222
OK, well, we've already seen that.

35:43.849 --> 35:46.768
OK, just unplug the computer.
Unplug. Go, go, go.

35:49.855 --> 35:51.648
- Was that a worm?
- Nope.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.901
This PDA is infected
with an extermination virus.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.196
Yes!

35:59.532 --> 36:01.241
What is going on in there?

36:02.952 --> 36:06.496
No, no, no! Not the line, not the line.
Don't cross the line.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.086
Busted.

36:14.213 --> 36:18.174
Can I offer you something?
A macadamia nut perhaps?

36:19.677 --> 36:23.722
So, this is why I never saw you eat.
Not once in all these years.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.932
All these treats and you never shared?

36:26.684 --> 36:29.436
You think I wanted to spend my nights
sneaking out to feed myself?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.521
Starving by day and
praying for night to come

36:31.605 --> 36:34.607
so I could take a bite without the
threat of you eating everything I have?

36:34.692 --> 36:36.359
You drove me to this!

36:43.325 --> 36:46.244
My friend Speckles
got crushed in a garbage truck,

36:46.328 --> 36:48.413
and you said nothing about this.

36:54.628 --> 36:55.628
I'm outta here.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.339
- Darwin? I want you to go.
- I am going.

36:58.424 --> 37:02.510
You can't worry about me. You got a job
to do. You can'tjeopardize it for me.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.637
- I wasn't going to.
- You're only saying that

37:04.722 --> 37:07.223
so I won't have to feel the pain so bad
when you leave.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.058
Keep believing that.
Whatever works for you.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.894
Oh, what a guy. What a guy!

37:11.312 --> 37:13.646
- OK, OK. Listen, Hurley.
- You got to go, man.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.815
- I got to go. You got to let go.
- You got to go.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.692
- I've got to let go.
- Let go of me.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.152
- OK.
- OK.

37:19.779 --> 37:20.904
Don't give up the dream.

37:20.988 --> 37:24.157
You're gonna find the family
you're looking for someday.

37:24.241 --> 37:25.492
So long.

37:30.247 --> 37:31.748
So long, brother!

37:33.167 --> 37:34.626
I miss him already.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.260
Good luck with the climb back up,
Hurley! The cage is mine!

37:44.345 --> 37:47.347
And it's all true.
My grandfather was a ferret!

37:48.474 --> 37:51.017
Now who's been marked down?

37:55.439 --> 37:58.942
So, there's the North Star,
which means Ben's is east.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.820
OK, I need to head that way.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.864
Go back, Hurley.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.953
Fine!
You think I can't make it out here?

38:10.037 --> 38:12.914
You think you're the only one
who can survive in the big bad world?

38:12.998 --> 38:17.460
Well, the truth is, Hurley is out of
his cage, and it's time to hit the town!

38:17.545 --> 38:19.712
Guinea pigs gone wild!

38:20.589 --> 38:21.589
Yeah!

38:24.385 --> 38:26.177
Darwin!

38:27.054 --> 38:29.973
Darwin? I saw a cat.

38:30.057 --> 38:33.476
OK, you can come with me
until we find another pet shop.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.521
Thanks, bro. Did I mention
I'm also afraid of the dark?

38:52.121 --> 38:56.082
Greetings, Mr. Saber.
I have a status report.

38:56.166 --> 38:59.502
You are a brilliant business partner,
Mr. Yanshu.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.756
But remind me why we call these things
video conferences.

39:03.841 --> 39:09.345
As we've discussed, it's in everyone's
best interest my identity remain hidden.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.349
Project Clusterstorm
is perfectly on course, sir.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.811
Sabersense will activate
in about 19 hours.

39:16.896 --> 39:21.107
Why are we spending a large amount
of money tracking space junk?

39:21.191 --> 39:23.568
Old satellites. Booster rockets.

39:23.652 --> 39:27.113
Four million pounds of debris.
And why do we care?

39:27.197 --> 39:30.533
The satellites, sir.
Communication systems.

39:30.618 --> 39:35.163
We have to protect them. Integral aspect
of the Sabersense network.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.999
We've got a lot riding on this, Yanshu.

39:38.083 --> 39:42.211
I've put my trust
in your engineering skills.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.775
- Mooch, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah!

40:04.985 --> 40:06.569
Are the others OK?

40:06.654 --> 40:08.821
- You know where they are?
- Yeah!

40:12.660 --> 40:13.785
You want help with that?

40:14.745 --> 40:20.500
E... I... i...

40:20.584 --> 40:21.834
...a...

40:23.796 --> 40:25.129
Oh, yeah.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.260
Oh, Mooch... You're a genius.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.931
I was so worried about you.
I don't like when my fly is down.

40:36.850 --> 40:40.019
Hey, Marcie?
Yeah, it's Ben. I found them.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.563
I'll be by in ten minutes
to pick you up.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.194
There's the delivery truck from the lab.

40:48.862 --> 40:50.571
¿Cómo estás, gentlemen?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.074
We're looking for some rodents.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.413
Si, for you or for your children?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.456
For the government.

41:00.874 --> 41:03.376
- We're special agents.
- What? Yeah, right.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.837
Are they fugitives
or terrorists or something?

41:05.921 --> 41:07.547
Just answer the question.

41:13.137 --> 41:17.390
OK, sorry. I'm just saying, you look
like a regular guinea pig to me.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.436
Listen, I told you, I'm a commando
who just happens to be a guinea pig.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.813
Oh, yeah?
So where's all your fancy spy gear?

41:25.149 --> 41:26.315
Back at the lab.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.569
Same lab where I keep
my hot Canadian guinea pig girlfriend?

41:30.070 --> 41:31.487
That's where my stuff is, too.

41:31.572 --> 41:34.157
I have a unicorn back there
and a dragon that I ride around.

41:34.241 --> 41:37.785
Look, if you want to stick with me,
stop with the yapping and keep up.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.413
No can do, bro.
I'm calling a hunger strike.

41:41.331 --> 41:43.958
And I am not moving an inch.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.636
Civilians. Come on, soggy.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.734
I'm hungry, I'm wet, I'm hungry...

42:12.154 --> 42:13.404
Dogs!

42:18.452 --> 42:21.454
Dogs. Why does it always
have to be dogs?

42:22.331 --> 42:24.874
All right, MacGyver,
you got any brilliant ideas?

42:28.087 --> 42:29.629
Yeah, I got an idea.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.724
- I think we made it.
- Great. How do we stop it?

42:41.809 --> 42:42.892
Just keep running.

42:42.976 --> 42:45.436
That's not how you stop it!
That's how you make it go!

42:53.070 --> 42:57.073
- Hurley, get your butt outta my face.
- Get your face outta my butt!

43:06.250 --> 43:08.000
So this is what spies do.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.674
¿Cómo estás, chica?

43:14.758 --> 43:16.843
We're looking for
three guinea pigs and a mole.

43:16.927 --> 43:20.680
Same one as the Feds,
or are yours from a rival militia?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.098
Wait, what Feds?

43:22.182 --> 43:24.600
Men in Black were here
looking for the same thing.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.477
Wanted to know who had bought them.

43:27.437 --> 43:28.729
And did you tell them?

43:28.814 --> 43:31.858
No, I refused and we shot it out.
What do you think? It's the Feds!

43:34.945 --> 43:36.028
Thank you.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.825
Mine! The cage is mine!

43:51.879 --> 43:53.546
This is gonna be awesome.

43:54.590 --> 43:58.217
I'm pretty sure this is
animal cruelty, but I love it!

43:58.802 --> 44:03.222
Yeah!

44:05.851 --> 44:07.059
This wheel doesn't work!

44:08.854 --> 44:10.229
Strike!

44:14.735 --> 44:17.737
- Is that all you got?
- Ready to go for the record?

44:20.240 --> 44:23.618
Maybe this would be a good time
for you to take your medication!

44:24.578 --> 44:28.289
I feel the need... the need for speed!

44:34.213 --> 44:35.755
Say cheese!

44:40.177 --> 44:44.138
Excuse me! Coming through!

44:47.267 --> 44:49.769
- Yeah!
- Yes!

44:50.729 --> 44:54.190
- That was off the hizz-ook!
- Connor! Take out the trash.

44:54.274 --> 44:55.942
OK.

44:56.735 --> 44:58.361
- Now!
- I'm coming!

45:00.239 --> 45:02.323
What do we have here?

45:04.284 --> 45:06.285
You, my friend, suck.

45:08.705 --> 45:10.831
I'm coming for you, Juarez.

45:20.259 --> 45:21.884
That's what I'm talking about!

45:23.303 --> 45:24.595
Time for a joyride.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.430
Yeah!

45:27.224 --> 45:28.683
Get out the road, fool!

45:28.767 --> 45:30.893
- Hey!
- Don't become roadkill!

45:30.978 --> 45:32.478
I ain't used to driving stick!

45:36.441 --> 45:39.151
- Not this time!
- Stop it. Stop it! Come back!

45:39.236 --> 45:41.988
I'll come back when you're older
and put you in prison!

45:42.072 --> 45:43.906
- Get over here!
- Don't go anywhere.

45:43.991 --> 45:46.075
- I'll be right back.
- Finally!

45:49.121 --> 45:52.540
- Juarez, Juarez! Where are you?
- Connor, get him!

45:52.624 --> 45:54.500
I have to save his fur again?

45:59.923 --> 46:01.173
Juarez?

46:03.927 --> 46:05.803
Juarez!

46:07.389 --> 46:08.973
Yeah!

46:15.731 --> 46:17.064
I got you!

46:17.149 --> 46:19.442
Why are you dressed like
"Guinea Pig Barbie?"

46:19.526 --> 46:22.111
One more word and I'll turn you
into a small side of bacon.

46:22.195 --> 46:23.779
Well, you are sizzling hot!

46:25.032 --> 46:26.032
Connor!

46:26.116 --> 46:28.159
Get this off of me!

46:34.207 --> 46:37.543
Don't need that, or that, or that!

46:38.420 --> 46:43.090
- Although, maybe this can stay.
- Juarez, you are fine china!

46:49.723 --> 46:51.474
What exactly are we doing, anyway?

46:51.558 --> 46:56.604
Two days ago, my team embarked on a
mission. Today, I'm gonna finish it.

46:57.606 --> 47:00.649
My brother's a loon!
I love him, but he's...

47:00.734 --> 47:05.112
Cake! Did I tell you I love cake?
I've heard of places like this!

47:05.197 --> 47:07.573
They sell something called "layer cake!"

47:07.657 --> 47:10.493
It's notjust one cake,
it's many, in layers!

47:10.577 --> 47:15.122
Often up to six!
It is the Holy Grail of human food!

47:15.207 --> 47:19.126
I can't believe you're getting
so excited about cake. Coffeemaker!

47:24.925 --> 47:28.052
That's the same coffeemaker
that was on the Clusterstorm file.

47:28.345 --> 47:31.389
Hurley, I got to check out
that coffeemaker. Stay close.

47:33.475 --> 47:36.685
Fifty billion rodents in the world,
and I get stuck with this guy.

47:45.195 --> 47:47.530
I hope you're keeping track
of all these parts.

47:47.614 --> 47:49.156
Don't watch me. Watch my back.

47:49.241 --> 47:53.160
Right now, you're my eyes and ears.
Just act natural.

47:53.245 --> 47:55.830
- OK. Sure.
- Look, Daddy!

47:59.876 --> 48:02.211
Hi, there. Hi.

48:02.295 --> 48:06.132
- That wasn't very convincing.
- Hurley, do you know what this is?

48:06.216 --> 48:08.217
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's called vandalism.

48:08.301 --> 48:10.845
This is a military grade,
multiple array transceiver

48:10.929 --> 48:13.514
developed for the military's
Unmanned Weapons Program.

48:13.598 --> 48:15.850
Sorry, I tuned out there.
What were you saying?

48:15.934 --> 48:17.935
I gotta get this chip back to Ben's.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.524
OK, that's weird.

48:28.238 --> 48:29.363
Hurley, duck!

48:30.782 --> 48:32.283
Stay down!

48:40.167 --> 48:43.085
I've heard coffee's bad for you,
but this is ridiculous!

48:43.170 --> 48:44.462
Come on, move it!

48:48.592 --> 48:50.843
- Why are we stopping?
- We're gonna fight it.

48:50.927 --> 48:52.428
We're gonna do what?

48:53.513 --> 48:55.389
We have to get that chip.

48:59.019 --> 49:00.436
Good luck with that!

49:10.113 --> 49:12.406
- Suck in your gut!
- I am!

49:16.286 --> 49:17.286
Darwin!

49:17.621 --> 49:18.621
Hang on, Hurley!

49:20.248 --> 49:22.082
Yippee-ki-yay, coffeemaker!

49:26.880 --> 49:28.506
Watch out, bro!

49:37.682 --> 49:40.476
You want some of this,
you overgrown can opener?

49:45.065 --> 49:47.316
Don't think the warranty
is gonna cover that.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.611
Oh, brother. I thought I lost you there.

49:50.695 --> 49:52.821
OK, thanks Hurley! Boundaries!

49:52.906 --> 49:56.492
Talk about a killer cappuccino.
What is this thing?

49:56.576 --> 49:58.702
This is Clusterstorm.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.831
Saber must be weaponizing
his entire line of appliances.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.542
We have to get this back to Ben's.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.752
How are we gonna do that?

50:15.136 --> 50:18.597
Hey, bro? You have to admit,
we make a pretty sweet team.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.517
I could get used to all this
secret agent stuff

50:21.601 --> 50:23.644
if you're ever looking
for a new recruit.

50:24.312 --> 50:27.022
Hurley, just be quiet and lean right.

50:28.608 --> 50:29.942
Look who I found out back.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.862
- Blaster! Juarez!
- Darwin! You made it.

50:33.947 --> 50:36.907
- Hurley, what are you doing here?
- Hey, guys!

50:36.992 --> 50:40.995
Hurley, up high. Down low. Too slow.

50:41.079 --> 50:43.163
Wait a minute. Where's Speckles?

50:46.126 --> 50:48.168
Speckles didn't make it.

50:48.253 --> 50:51.130
- What do you mean, he didn't make it?
- He was gonna break out

50:51.214 --> 50:54.133
and engineer our escape,
but then the mission went bad.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.304
He got crushed in a garbage truck.

50:59.639 --> 51:03.350
- Speckles. Jeez.
- He sacrificed himself for us.

51:04.227 --> 51:05.603
This is all my fault.

51:06.271 --> 51:08.480
Ben, there's nothing you could've done.

51:10.692 --> 51:13.986
No, I could've told you the truth
ofwho you really are.

51:16.156 --> 51:18.198
Darwin, I misled you.

51:19.451 --> 51:22.411
The truth is,
you're not genetically engineered.

51:22.996 --> 51:24.371
Any of you.

51:24.456 --> 51:28.125
I should've never... should've never
sent you out into the field. It's...

51:29.461 --> 51:33.422
So we are not special at all?

51:33.506 --> 51:36.884
No engineering? No enhancements?

51:36.968 --> 51:41.013
We're just common, ordinary rodents?

51:41.097 --> 51:44.099
I wanted you guys to think of yourselves
as more than just balls of fur

51:44.184 --> 51:45.643
waiting for your next pellet.

51:46.269 --> 51:49.021
Well, maybe you can
explain that to Speckles.

51:50.857 --> 51:54.526
Ben, we need to know.
Tell us who we are.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.779
OK, you guys want to know?

51:56.863 --> 52:01.867
Juarez, we rescued you at a
roadside tapas stand in the Pyrenees.

52:01.951 --> 52:04.912
I guess there you're some kind of,
you know, delicacy.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.666
Blaster, we found you
at a cosmetics company.

52:08.750 --> 52:12.961
They were testing, you know, some kind
of hair gel for allergic reactions.

52:14.381 --> 52:15.589
And Speckles we found...

52:16.383 --> 52:19.677
...you know, right before his
home was dug out to build a golf course.

52:21.388 --> 52:22.388
And, Darwin, I...

52:24.557 --> 52:26.642
I purchased you at a pet store.

52:26.726 --> 52:31.563
Your parents abandoned you
because you were the runt of the litter.

52:31.648 --> 52:35.359
I was a runt? What do you mean?

52:38.238 --> 52:40.572
I never even had a chance.

52:46.228 --> 52:47.311
This is Carter.

52:49.231 --> 52:50.523
OK, we're on it.

52:50.607 --> 52:54.985
Dispatch just got a report of two giant
hamsters riding a skateboard on Pacific.

52:55.570 --> 52:56.987
Let's finish this.

53:01.034 --> 53:05.788
You were right all along. I am just an
average, everyday pet store guinea pig.

53:06.832 --> 53:09.583
Since when did you
start listening to me?

53:10.001 --> 53:12.253
My parents didn't even want me.

53:13.421 --> 53:17.258
Look, Darwin, you saved us from
the dogs, you defeated the Terminator,

53:17.342 --> 53:19.760
read the stars like a map
and got us here.

53:19.845 --> 53:21.720
I couldn't have done any of that.

53:21.805 --> 53:25.683
Do you have any idea how many guinea
pigs could've done all those things?

53:25.767 --> 53:29.603
I mean, literally, like three.
And they're all in this room.

53:34.985 --> 53:36.443
Yeah, you're right.

53:36.528 --> 53:40.447
I may not be genetically engineered,
but I'm no house pet, either.

53:41.074 --> 53:45.119
Hey team, come over here. Listen up.
What Ben did was right.

53:45.203 --> 53:49.248
He wanted us to believe in ourselves.
And we did believe.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.002
We still have our training,
our abilities.

53:53.086 --> 53:55.880
Blaster, you're a graduate
of West Point.

53:56.548 --> 53:58.966
Yeah, correspondence course.

53:59.050 --> 54:02.761
Yeah, whatever. And Juarez, how many
hours have you put in on that simulator?

54:03.388 --> 54:05.723
Two hundred... thousand.

54:06.766 --> 54:08.267
I helped with the tire!

54:08.894 --> 54:14.148
We may be guinea pigs,
but we're not ordinary. We're special.

54:14.232 --> 54:18.319
I still believe in us,
even if nobody else does.

54:20.071 --> 54:24.283
I believe.

54:29.414 --> 54:30.831
I've always believed.

54:32.042 --> 54:35.419
Ben, we don't have much time.
That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.

54:38.924 --> 54:43.010
When I tried to disconnect this chip,
it came alive and it attacked us.

54:44.054 --> 54:46.138
It was so gnarly!

54:46.222 --> 54:49.308
If I hadn't been there to take
cover fire for Darwin, who knows...

54:50.769 --> 54:53.437
The Sabersense microchip
caused it to transform.

54:53.521 --> 54:56.982
Ben, Sabersense and Clusterstorm
are the same thing.

54:57.067 --> 54:59.902
And if every Saber product
in the world has that chip,

54:59.986 --> 55:03.530
that means that every appliance on Earth
is gonna be a killing machine.

55:04.074 --> 55:05.199
Guys...

55:06.618 --> 55:10.537
Sabersense launches in... 30 minutes.

55:10.622 --> 55:13.123
I tried to access the
Clusterstorm file on your PDA,

55:13.208 --> 55:15.542
but Saber, he protected it
with some nasty virus.

55:15.627 --> 55:17.795
I mean, I'm a little bit at a loss.

55:20.674 --> 55:22.549
Sorry to interrupt. Quick question.

55:22.634 --> 55:25.552
If that little thingamabob
is all that, like you say it is,

55:25.637 --> 55:28.180
why don't you just use that
to destroy Saber's mainframe?

55:31.059 --> 55:34.061
I'll go back in the box. Oh, pepperoni!

55:34.145 --> 55:37.606
- That could work. That could work!
- OK, let's do this!

55:37.691 --> 55:40.526
Wait a second.
We don't have our equipment.

55:40.610 --> 55:43.153
Well, that's not entirely true.

55:49.577 --> 55:51.996
This is a little prototype
I've been working on

55:52.080 --> 55:54.707
called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle.

55:54.791 --> 55:57.376
She'll do 65
with the throttle wide open.

55:58.670 --> 56:02.965
And, Blaster, it has a rocking stereo.

56:04.134 --> 56:07.886
That's what's up! Pimp my ride!

56:07.971 --> 56:10.931
All right, we got gear.
And we know our mission.

56:11.016 --> 56:14.560
Infiltrate Saber's mansion,
locate the main network core

56:14.644 --> 56:16.603
and dock this infected PDA.

56:16.688 --> 56:20.024
Bring down big mama with baby disease.

56:20.108 --> 56:22.985
I don't know what that means.
But, yeah, that's good.

56:24.362 --> 56:25.696
Here are the keys.

56:27.866 --> 56:32.494
- Don't scratch it.
- All right. This is for Speckles.

56:35.915 --> 56:38.961
Dr. Kendall, we know you're in there!
Open the door!

56:39.046 --> 56:42.089
Everybody, into the RDV!
You, too, Hurley. Move it!

56:42.174 --> 56:43.174
Shotgun!

56:45.511 --> 56:48.262
Open the door, or we'll open it for you!

56:55.896 --> 56:57.063
Hold on.

56:57.147 --> 56:59.482
Don't these fools
know we're on the same team?

56:59.566 --> 57:02.360
- Juarez, plot us a course to Saber's.
- I'm on it.

57:05.864 --> 57:08.991
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

57:09.076 --> 57:11.160
Mooch, we need eyes in the sky.

57:16.041 --> 57:17.333
Call for backup.

57:17.417 --> 57:20.711
Tell them we're in pursuit of three
guinea pigs driving mobile spheres.

57:20.796 --> 57:21.796
OK!

57:23.006 --> 57:25.550
Actually, could you make that call?

57:27.261 --> 57:29.846
My stomach doesn't do well
with action-adventure.

57:29.930 --> 57:31.681
Hurley, don't you dare.

57:33.475 --> 57:35.142
Yuck, Hurley. That's disgusting.

57:35.227 --> 57:37.270
- I can't breathe.
- Roll down the window.

57:37.354 --> 57:41.482
- These things don't have windows!
- That's real professional, guys.

57:44.903 --> 57:46.654
Mooch, where's that recon?

57:50.784 --> 57:54.036
- OK, here come the bad guys.
- Better have their "A" game.

57:57.624 --> 58:00.376
- Yeah!
- Mommy!

58:00.460 --> 58:02.378
Where's that backup?

58:05.757 --> 58:09.552
- May I ask why we're chasing rodents?
- No, you may not.

58:12.472 --> 58:14.849
OK, you can just
let me out at the next corner.

58:18.312 --> 58:20.646
We got three party crashers on our tail.

58:22.399 --> 58:25.067
- Hurry up! You're losing them!
- They're boxing us in!

58:25.152 --> 58:28.362
- Yeah, I got 'em, I got 'em.
- Maybe they want to adopt us!

58:28.447 --> 58:31.240
Not likely, Hurley. Hold on, guys!

58:31.325 --> 58:34.076
- Let's just crush 'em!
- Unlock it and rock it. Now!

58:36.163 --> 58:38.915
- Time to divide and conquer.
- See ya!

58:43.670 --> 58:48.382
- Oh, yeah! Come and get me!
- Where'd he go?

58:48.467 --> 58:51.302
- How low can you go?
- There he goes! Under the trailer!

58:51.386 --> 58:52.678
Little is the new big!

58:56.600 --> 58:59.393
Bye-bye, bipeds! Smell you later!

58:59.478 --> 59:02.480
- I want to go back to the pet store!
- You might want to buckle up.

59:08.737 --> 59:11.364
He paid for undercoating.
What a sucker!

59:11.990 --> 59:14.033
Let's see if it protects him from this.

59:15.202 --> 59:18.329
- Hey, what's that?
- This is my little friend.

59:20.207 --> 59:22.667
- Say hello.
- Hello!

59:23.210 --> 59:24.669
And goodbye!

59:26.463 --> 59:28.047
Better hang on to your lunch!

59:44.147 --> 59:45.439
Did we win?

59:46.733 --> 59:49.986
This is Unit Two. We lost them.

59:50.070 --> 59:53.948
How? You're driving a V-8. They're
rolling around in little plastic balls.

59:54.032 --> 59:56.075
This one's not getting away from me!

59:58.245 --> 01:00:00.204
Darwin, I need some help here.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.707
Mooch, I need a visual on Juarez.

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:09.338
- I can't get these guys off my tail.
- We don't have tails.

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:14.301
Hang on, Juarez. Hurley, we're
going to the fair. Blaster, hard right.

01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:17.096
All right, Juarez.
Let's take it to the house!

01:00:22.769 --> 01:00:24.270
OK, I'm taking the lead.

01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:31.360
- You're scaring me!
- Shut it, Carter!

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:34.864
Here's that box of M-80s.
Careful with these.

01:00:34.948 --> 01:00:37.783
- You're driving angry!
- Yes, I am!

01:00:41.288 --> 01:00:42.872
Come here, you little rodent.

01:00:43.749 --> 01:00:45.541
Carl, look out! Look out!

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:48.294
Let's let 'em go,
let's let 'em go! Look out!

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:59.555
- This is so festive!
- This is crazy. This is crazy!

01:00:59.639 --> 01:01:01.223
These are good seats!

01:01:01.308 --> 01:01:03.392
I'm gonna flatten this little varmint!

01:01:03.477 --> 01:01:06.228
Mess with the bull, you get the horns.

01:01:07.147 --> 01:01:09.315
Look out! Look out!

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.249
How you doing?

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:31.504
Don't try this at home, kids!

01:01:34.007 --> 01:01:37.510
That was great! Let's do it again.

01:01:40.472 --> 01:01:45.517
Face it, Trigstad.
You just got out-driven by gophers.

01:01:54.903 --> 01:01:58.280
- Guys, I'm going in.
- Hurley, suck in your gut.

01:01:58.365 --> 01:02:00.783
Blaster, I need to
tell you something about Juarez.

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:03.452
You have nothing to worry about.
She's not interested in me.

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:06.247
- She told you that?
- Yeah. She really wants you...

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:09.625
She's trying to make you more interested
in her by acting disinterested.

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:11.961
Yeah, well maybe
she told you she wants me

01:02:12.045 --> 01:02:16.298
in order to look not interested in you,
which makes you more interested in her.

01:02:16.383 --> 01:02:17.675
Interesting.

01:02:21.054 --> 01:02:25.724
Members of the Saberling inner sanctum,
my co-conspirators in this endeavour,

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.602
are we ready to dominate?

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:33.065
Are we ready to change the world?

01:02:35.944 --> 01:02:38.487
- Go, go, go, go!
- Geronimo!

01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:45.160
Hurley, this is our exfil. It's very
important that you stand guard.

01:02:45.245 --> 01:02:48.372
Whatever you do, don't leave this spot.
We're counting on you.

01:02:48.456 --> 01:02:50.207
OK, OK. Got it.

01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:52.459
Hey, does this mean
I'm part of the team?

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.755
There's the network core.
Behind the glass.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.301
Look! We can gain access
through that panel.

01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:02.428
OK, follow me.

01:03:04.597 --> 01:03:06.056
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

01:03:06.141 --> 01:03:07.516
It's a tripwire.

01:03:08.268 --> 01:03:11.437
It's a booby trap.
Don't touch it, or this place'll blow.

01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:14.565
Tick, tick, boom.

01:03:27.662 --> 01:03:30.331
I don't think anybody'll mind
if I check the perimeter.

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:34.376
As I press this button,

01:03:34.461 --> 01:03:37.963
we move forward
to a brave new world order

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.550
owned and operated by Saberling.

01:03:59.319 --> 01:04:00.569
We're too late.

01:04:00.653 --> 01:04:04.365
We can still stop it ifwe download the
virus into Saber's computer. Let's go.

01:04:06.826 --> 01:04:07.993
Cherries.

01:04:17.879 --> 01:04:20.839
Cake! Oh, you're so beautiful!

01:04:22.717 --> 01:04:24.927
Oh, come to Papa!

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:52.554
It's all Saber, sir.
Is this enough probable cause?

01:04:55.432 --> 01:04:57.934
Eyewitnesses report
common household appliances

01:04:58.018 --> 01:05:01.729
- coming to life and chasing people...
- Those are Saberling appliances!

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:04.774
But they're just supposed to
communicate with each other.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:17.036
- Bravo, Echo! Go! Go!
- Spread out!

01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:20.540
What is that thing?

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:24.127
It's heading for the tripwire.

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:29.549
- It's got Hurley!
- Oh, hey guys!

01:05:29.633 --> 01:05:33.178
- What's it doing?
- Peppers. Casserole.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.305
It's trying to figure out
how long to cook him.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:37.807
Cook me? Get me out of here!

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:42.562
- Move it, Blaster!
- I don't want to be an appetizer!

01:05:42.646 --> 01:05:44.689
- We got to save him!
- Get me out!

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.233
Let's go to Plan B!

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.569
- Blaster, immobilize that thing!
- I'm on it!

01:05:49.653 --> 01:05:52.697
- Don't let it hit the tripwire!
- I want to go home!

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:58.745
Soup. Eggs. Beef.

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:02.582
- Oh, man! It's packing a toaster!
- Broccoli.

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:06.002
All teams, go, go!

01:06:09.381 --> 01:06:11.216
Why is this happening?

01:06:12.384 --> 01:06:14.135
This wasn't the plan!

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.846
- Saber, what's going on?
- Get us out of here!

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:19.974
Take Saber down to the command truck!

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:23.811
Bacon. Carrot. Soup.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:26.814
- Hurley, don't be scared.
- I'm not a chicken.

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:28.650
Chicken. Match.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:33.071
Not even close!

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:40.036
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a little piece of cake!

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.833
- Didn't drop the cake.
- Hurley, let's go!

01:06:47.753 --> 01:06:49.295
Hunk ofjunk!

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.257
It's gonna hit the tripwire!

01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:00.932
- Run for cover!
- Darwin, jump!

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.142
No!

01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:30.837
Are you OK? We can't get through.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.880
I'm all right. I'm gonna keep going.

01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:35.008
Not without us. No way.

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:38.094
There's no time.
I've got to take down the network core.

01:07:40.764 --> 01:07:43.349
Hurley, I told you
stay put and guard the exfil.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.477
Didn't I tell you that?
I thought I could depend on you.

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.441
All right. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

01:07:57.531 --> 01:08:01.492
Good luck, Darwin.
We'll find another way through.

01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:09.500
OK, this is good. Over there.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:13.880
Marcie, let's go.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.426
I find it hard to believe
you've got nothing to do with this.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.011
You have to believe me.
I don't know what's going on.

01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:24.557
I only wanted to be the biggest
appliance manufacturer in the world.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.853
What do you want?
I got major problems here.

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:32.106
There's your problem. The transmission's
coming off the core of his computer.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.359
- G-Force went in to shut it down.
- G-Force?

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:37.028
You sent those gophers in
without my authorization?

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:40.281
Sir, I'm picking up a video feed.
It's one of ours.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.616
Let's see it.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.826
- What in the heck is that?
- That's Darwin.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.453
You say that like it's a good thing.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.205
What's he gonna do,
gnaw his way out of there?

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:50.375
He's gonna insert a virus into
the core and take down the network.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:03.388
- Hello, Darwin.
- Speckles, you're alive.

01:09:03.846 --> 01:09:07.809
You infiltrated the bad guy's lair.
Where is he?

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:10.478
I am the bad guy.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.607
What? You really think I let myself
get killed in a garbage truck?

01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:18.986
Well, I hid in a soup can.
Rode it all the way to the city dump.

01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:20.654
And it was stinky.

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:24.450
- Speckles?
- I can't believe the mole was the mole.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.037
Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:32.067
- No.
- Business associate of Leonard Saber.

01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:35.569
You tricked Saber
into helping you build Clusterstorm?

01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:37.531
How could you do this to us?

01:09:37.615 --> 01:09:40.867
I thought we were friends.
I put my life on the line for you.

01:09:40.952 --> 01:09:44.705
Yanshu was in my basement
this whole time?

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:46.497
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:49.251
"Yanshu" is the Chinese word for mole.

01:09:49.335 --> 01:09:50.836
Sabersense was just a cover.

01:09:53.006 --> 01:09:55.549
I created an army of robotic appliances,

01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:59.428
and they created an array of
giant electromagnetic nodes...

01:09:59.512 --> 01:10:02.597
Nodes capable of pulling down all

01:10:02.682 --> 01:10:08.186
the space junk orbiting the planet,
and driving every human underground.

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:13.942
- So, what do you think?
- You've betrayed us. You!

01:10:14.027 --> 01:10:19.406
- You sabotaged our presentation.
- Extermination virus. Nasty stuff.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.241
Speckles, why?

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:27.289
You ever Google the word "mole", Darwin?
Three million entries.

01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:31.418
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

01:10:31.502 --> 01:10:34.379
Three million entries
on how to exterminate them!

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:39.342
The humans came and destroyed
our home... destroyed our home.

01:10:39.427 --> 01:10:41.845
Son, if you ever get the chance

01:10:41.929 --> 01:10:45.515
to bring mankind to its knees... do it.

01:10:49.687 --> 01:10:51.772
They showed us no mercy, Darwin.

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:54.900
Well, now it's my turn
to do a little pest control.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:58.361
If you'll excuse me... it's showtime.

01:10:59.697 --> 01:11:02.574
Going up!

01:11:11.584 --> 01:11:13.835
He's created some kind of monster.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.463
I think I'll stay here
and guard the exfil.

01:11:16.714 --> 01:11:20.967
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

01:11:21.052 --> 01:11:23.595
That's more of a goal than a plan.

01:11:31.703 --> 01:11:35.873
It's working! Look out!
I'm feeling ten feet tall.

01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:48.094
No place like home.
There's no place like home.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.845
That'll leave a mark.

01:11:50.722 --> 01:11:53.474
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.768
How big is this thing going to get?

01:11:57.854 --> 01:12:01.941
You humans stole my home!
Now I will steal yours.

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:04.819
Look out!

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:09.907
Something is missing. Oh, I know!

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.087
Incoming!

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:28.092
Just like humans.
Bringing guns to a space junk fight.

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:32.763
- Darwin!
- Speckles, shut this down, now!

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.850
- No.
- Then I'll shut you down.

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:39.937
I have no quarrel with you, Darwin,
but mankind must pay.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.315
You know I can't let you do that.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:44.650
Then you leave me no choice, my friend.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.159
My parachute.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.167
The PDA!

01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:04.170
Go get it, girl.

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:10.676
No!

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:38.954
Hurley, what are you doing?

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.582
I gotta get you back up there.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:46.504
- No, Hurley! Don't do it.
- Go get him, bro! It's the only way!

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.390
Coming, Hurley!

01:14:01.853 --> 01:14:05.690
Take that! And that!
It's no fun being the little guy, is it?

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.484
Everybody, hold on!

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.529
Fall back!

01:14:19.287 --> 01:14:21.038
Speckles, if you keep doing this

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:25.459
then you're no better than the humans
who destroyed your home and your family.

01:14:25.585 --> 01:14:29.531
Well, that's kind of the point here.
I lost my family.

01:14:29.615 --> 01:14:32.283
No, you're wrong. We're your family.

01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:35.912
Me and Blaster
and Juarez and Ben and Marcie.

01:14:37.456 --> 01:14:41.543
Speckles, Ben took us in
when nobody else wanted us.

01:14:41.627 --> 01:14:43.753
And he made us a family.

01:14:47.508 --> 01:14:49.634
We're a family.

01:14:53.639 --> 01:14:56.975
Oh, no! No! What have I done?
What have I done?

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:02.230
It's too late, Darwin! I can't stop it!

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.816
But we can.

01:15:16.954 --> 01:15:19.747
It's working! Darwin, it's working!

01:15:21.625 --> 01:15:23.293
Speckles, come with me.

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:31.551
I got you!

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.615
We've gotta find Hurley.

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.081
- Hold it right there.
- We'll take him from here.

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:03.875
Relax, guys. He's code four.

01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:07.545
- What a mess.
- There you go. Easy.

01:16:10.507 --> 01:16:13.134
- Darwin, over here!
- Hang on!

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.180
- I got him. I got him.
- I can't hold it much longer.

01:16:20.684 --> 01:16:22.268
No, Hurley.

01:16:22.895 --> 01:16:25.021
No, not you, Hurley.

01:16:25.105 --> 01:16:27.899
Look, he landed next to his cake.

01:16:28.943 --> 01:16:29.943
No.

01:16:31.862 --> 01:16:32.987
Oh, man, Hurley.

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:36.407
- Hurley.
- Oh, no.

01:16:37.576 --> 01:16:41.079
No. No. This is all my fault.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.665
He was my man.

01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:46.251
Hurley, wake up, pal.

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.295
Listen, I just...

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:53.675
I just wanted you to know you
were as good as anyone out there today.

01:16:54.593 --> 01:16:57.011
I don't know what they call it
back in the pet shop,

01:16:57.096 --> 01:17:00.682
but out here we...
well, we call it being a hero.

01:17:01.558 --> 01:17:04.352
All you ever wanted was a family.

01:17:04.436 --> 01:17:06.271
I never got to tell you this, but...

01:17:06.939 --> 01:17:10.858
I'd be proud...
proud to call you my brother.

01:17:17.783 --> 01:17:19.200
Hurley.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.247
Hey, I think I saw his nose twitch.

01:17:29.962 --> 01:17:30.962
Hurley?

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:35.341
Did you mean it
when you called me "brother?"

01:17:35.426 --> 01:17:38.136
Not exactly. I was just...
That was like a figurative...

01:17:40.306 --> 01:17:45.476
- You bet I did.
- Brother. I have a brother!

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.228
This is great!

01:17:47.313 --> 01:17:49.105
We can spend every
Thanksgiving together,

01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:52.066
take road trips to Vegas,
have tickle fights!

01:17:52.151 --> 01:17:55.069
Oh, come here. Give me a hug, bro.

01:17:59.783 --> 01:18:01.451
Oh, this is great!

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:10.835
So, Hurley.
You still want to be a part of the team?

01:18:15.341 --> 01:18:16.674
Two...

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:18.634
Three...

01:18:19.303 --> 01:18:20.553
Twenty-seven!

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:23.848
- Hurley. I'm right here watching you.
- Thirty-two.

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:26.768
OK, that's it.
I don't want to get too buff.

01:18:26.852 --> 01:18:28.353
Not to worry.

01:18:30.564 --> 01:18:34.108
Alrighty, guys.
Welcome to your new home.

01:18:34.526 --> 01:18:37.779
OK, but I'm telling you now,
I don't do well with roommates.

01:18:37.863 --> 01:18:41.282
- Easy there, tiger.
- Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

01:18:41.367 --> 01:18:43.117
Jail break! Jail break!

01:18:45.245 --> 01:18:49.791
Look, Juarez, I gotta know.
Which one of us are you interested in?

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:53.461
No, no, Blaster! You've gotta ask her
who she's not interested in.

01:18:53.545 --> 01:18:55.296
Thirty, 42, 83.

01:18:55.381 --> 01:18:58.633
As far as I can tell,
you're not interested in either of us,

01:18:58.717 --> 01:19:02.136
which means either
you want both of us or neither of us,

01:19:02.221 --> 01:19:05.932
which leaves us desperate
even though we don't have a clue!

01:19:06.016 --> 01:19:08.226
And that's just how I like it.

01:19:09.728 --> 01:19:12.730
Hey, guys? It's the Director of the FBI.

01:19:13.899 --> 01:19:17.276
G-Force. I want you to know
that Leonard Saber

01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:21.823
has been forced to undertake the largest
recall of consumer products in history.

01:19:21.907 --> 01:19:25.535
And he's getting help from somebody
quite knowledgeable about the defects.

01:19:27.246 --> 01:19:30.540
Three down, 178,000 to go.

01:19:31.458 --> 01:19:33.584
I think I'm gonna be here awhile.

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:37.797
But I'm gonna rejoin the team
when I'm done. If they'll have me.

01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:42.093
Your friend, Agent Killian, has been
reassigned. He has a few words for you.

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.388
Hello, G-Force.

01:19:45.889 --> 01:19:48.599
Look! A frozen FBI-cicle.

01:19:50.936 --> 01:19:52.812
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:57.150
How long do I have to stay down here?
It's really cold!

01:19:57.776 --> 01:20:00.361
Team. As the full details
of your valour come to light,

01:20:00.446 --> 01:20:05.783
it is an honour and a privilege to say
"thank you" on behalf of this country.

01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:09.996
You guinea pigs pack more courage and
heart into those teensy little frames

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.081
than any agents I've ever seen.

01:20:12.499 --> 01:20:17.670
G-Force, your funding has been restored.
Welcome to the FBI.

01:20:18.505 --> 01:20:21.215
Guys... we got our badges.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:26.345
- Yeah, boy! We're official-tishal now!
- Finally!

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.478
Not bad for a runt.

01:20:34.313 --> 01:20:36.481
Thanks for believing in me, Ben.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.029
Hurley, I've been thinking...

01:20:43.113 --> 01:20:46.407
If you're gonna be out there
helping us save the world,

01:20:46.492 --> 01:20:49.660
you're gonna need this.
You're one of us now.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:53.831
My very own badge
and a new name! Rookie!

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:59.003
- So we're finally agents.
- No, special agents.

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:11.682
Let's get this party started right!

01:21:11.683 --> 01:21:15.520
Get him on the good foot!
All right, Hurley!

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:22.985
G-Force in the house!

01:21:40.546 --> 01:21:41.963
My turn! My turn!

01:21:55.435 --> 01:21:59.480
Hey, boys!
This ferret can dance, right? Right?

01:21:59.565 --> 01:22:00.731
Wrong!

01:22:01.567 --> 01:22:02.650
Oh, Bucky!

01:22:02.734 --> 01:22:04.986
Oh, yeah!

01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.166
I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.589
Good thing I took shop.

01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:53.342
Cherries.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:58.972
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:04.311
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:09.066
I'm Jeff Gordon! With fur!
