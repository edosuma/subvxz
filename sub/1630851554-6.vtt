WEBVTT

00:06.339 --> 00:08.258
[upbeat music playing]

00:13.054 --> 00:14.222
Come on! Come on!

00:14.889 --> 00:16.433
Okay.

00:16.516 --> 00:20.645
So, we've got four teams left on this.
We've made it this far.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.063
Amazing. Let's go.

00:22.147 --> 00:22.981
Mission Six.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.315
Skyscraper, okay.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.483
I like skyscrapers.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.028
-[Taylor] One edible city block.
-[Steve] Five-foot gingerbread.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.863
-[Sara] Two cake structures.
-[Cindy] Seismic?

00:29.946 --> 00:32.991
-[Menuka] It's a shake table.
-[Brandi] For earthquake simulation.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.994
Oh, my gosh, five feet?
That's as tall as me.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.206
Hey, friends.
So, these bakineers are about to find out

00:40.290 --> 00:44.669
that hard hats will be required
in this cake construction zone,

00:44.753 --> 00:49.799
because, today, the bakineers are
baking and building edible skyscrapers.

00:49.883 --> 00:54.262
Which I guess makes them skybakers.
Makes me a piescraper. I don't know.

00:54.345 --> 00:58.266
The point is, they're gigantic, edible,
and we might just shake 'em to the ground,

00:58.349 --> 01:01.603
'cause this is Baking Impossible.
We do crazy stuff with cake!

01:07.859 --> 01:10.278
I love any kind of artistic thing.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.281
Yeah. Let's do art.
Let's get centralized on art.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.159
Cities that--
Barcelona is an amazing city of art.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.995
Let's make it a futuristic city
that appreciates art, right?

01:19.079 --> 01:19.913
Uh-huh.

01:19.996 --> 01:20.955
This is a challenge.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.917
Buildings don't withstand earthquakes.
This is a tough one.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.545
This is the biggest mission
we've had the bakineers undertake to date.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.340
These bakineers have
a load of work ahead of them.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.425
Since we don't want
our bakineers collapsing,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.719
this'll be our very first
two-day challenge,

01:34.803 --> 01:37.764
broken up into two seven-hour days.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.599
In terms of the spec for this mission,

01:39.682 --> 01:42.811
we're requiring that they make
a five-foot tall skyscraper,

01:42.894 --> 01:45.063
but it's gotta be on a city block,
so we expect

01:45.146 --> 01:48.358
two other structural elements
to make up that city block.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.485
I spent three months in Japan.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.655
We can add mountain in the back.
Maybe Mount Fuji.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.406
Do you wanna say Pittsburgh in fall?

01:55.490 --> 01:58.535
-Beautiful autumn Midwest cityscape?
-Yes.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.453
If we do Venice, we could--

02:00.537 --> 02:03.957
-That sounds good. Absolutely.
-That's like a water city. Right? Okay.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.752
Their buildings are going to be facing
the ultimate structural stress test,

02:07.836 --> 02:11.422
a little something
I like to call The Bake Quake.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.344
We're gonna take their whole cityscape
and then put it on a seismic shake table

02:16.427 --> 02:20.807
engineered specifically to mimic
three distinct levels of seismic activity.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.977
In timed increments,
we'll slowly increase the shaking until…

02:24.561 --> 02:26.563
Until it all comes tumbling down.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.356
[laughing evilly] Yes!

02:28.439 --> 02:31.484
The goal is to reduce
the effect of the vibration

02:31.568 --> 02:32.944
as it travels up the building.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.989
It's kind of like cakes
when we put straws or dowels

02:36.072 --> 02:38.283
and put another cake circle.
That's how you stack

02:38.366 --> 02:39.826
a wedding or a two-tiered cake.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.328
-Absolutely that concept.
-That's cool. That's cool.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.040
We need something to be flexible
but not too rigid.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.377
But we also need rigid.
But again, not too flexible.

02:49.460 --> 02:53.798
When I build wedding cakes,
I use a tiered effect

02:53.882 --> 02:55.592
so it goes from a larger to smaller.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.760
If you could give me
the mathematical equations

02:57.844 --> 03:01.389
on how wide the base needs to be
to go up five feet,

03:01.472 --> 03:03.474
and I think we could start from there.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.061
The physics of earthquakes is amazing.
What these buildings have to survive.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.440
They're gonna have to think
about a lot of their structural choices.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.900
What materials they use,

03:11.983 --> 03:14.694
what is the weight distribution
of those materials,

03:14.777 --> 03:16.905
what is the shape of the building?

03:16.988 --> 03:18.448
What is the best shape for a--?

03:18.531 --> 03:22.243
Triangles. I'm thinking triangles.
We'll do a big tower of triangles.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.495
Like, central column,
that's the most strong one

03:24.579 --> 03:29.042
and then these will be supporting it.
Thick at the bottom, thinner as we go up.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.253
So, normally,
we let them choose their edible materials.

03:32.337 --> 03:36.799
But when it comes to skyscrapers,
we're requiring them to use gingerbread.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.177
So, they can do things
in addition to gingerbread.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.846
-But gingerbread is the steel.
-Yes. That's the structure.

03:41.930 --> 03:46.017
-If you're building a house it's the wood.
-It's the skeleton of the building.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.478
Structure-wise,
we can have a reinforcement

03:48.561 --> 03:50.188
with the gingerbread.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.316
Also, we have our cool, edible,
secret glue too. I think this is--

03:53.399 --> 03:56.611
That's true. That'd be good
to absorb the vibration.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.821
-That's-- Exactly.
-[Steve] Gelatin.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.822
-Gelatin?
-Yeah.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.033
-For the center? Yeah.
-To actually smash it?

04:02.116 --> 04:05.161
I'm thinking of a center core
running up through the building

04:05.245 --> 04:07.330
with gelatin,
because you've got the wobble

04:07.413 --> 04:09.749
in the gelatin,
but it would also hold the building?

04:09.832 --> 04:12.252
So, the whole tube
has a slight wobble to it.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.965
The bakineers also have to build us
an entirely edible city block.

04:17.590 --> 04:21.427
And the flavor profile of the cake?
It has to match the city theme.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.429
I hope you like the smell of gingerbread.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.432
-I love gingerbread. Let's do it.
-That's what I'll start doing.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.518
[clock ticking]

04:28.601 --> 04:30.853
[upbeat music playing]

04:37.485 --> 04:40.989
So, I'm thinking, Rodolfo,
it really is gonna come down to the joints

04:41.072 --> 04:43.032
and how we hold things together.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.160
-So, this glue could be the golden ticket.
-That's the secret?

04:46.244 --> 04:49.622
Our edible skyscraper
is primarily gingerbread.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.749
That's what the big
structural panels will be,

04:51.833 --> 04:53.918
but inside, I'm gonna use pretzel rods

04:54.002 --> 04:56.462
as sort of columns encased
in our candy epoxy

04:56.546 --> 04:59.507
so we can wedge the corners
and make sure they're gonna stay

04:59.590 --> 05:00.883
exactly where they need to.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.094
-How many bears will you kill?
-There's so many.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.680
-[Rodolfo] How many gummy bears?
-[Sara] Gummy bear graveyard.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.391
We decided that we're gonna
go with this candy epoxy,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.978
because we know
that it's gonna be really, really strong.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.940
And hopefully, the combination of caramel
with a little bit of the gummy bear

05:16.024 --> 05:18.776
and marshmallow is
also gonna give a little elasticity

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
so when it comes time
for that shaking to occur,

05:21.279 --> 05:25.116
it's not gonna be brittle and snap apart,
it'll hold its shape and take that load.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.659
Okay.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.745
So, I'm a lighting designer now,

05:28.828 --> 05:31.080
but my background
is in architectural engineering.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.083
So, I took a few structural courses
way back when

05:34.167 --> 05:37.879
and I work with structural engineers
every day, so it's a part of my life now,

05:37.962 --> 05:41.174
so I'm pretty excited that this mission
actually dips into that part.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.926
-Hello, Sara.
-Hello, guys.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.762
-Hi, Rodolfo.
-Get your game face on.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.973
So, Sara, Rodolfo,
talk to us about your edible cityscape.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.309
We are starting
with the idea of Barcelona,

05:51.392 --> 05:53.770
as it's already a city
that embraces and loves art.

05:53.853 --> 05:58.483
So, our futuristic Barcelona
centers around a giant skyscraper.

05:58.566 --> 06:02.945
Surrounding the skyscraper is
a park that's made mostly out of cake.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.406
We've got two buildings as well
in the park.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.534
We have our Tree of Ténéré,
which is this modeling chocolate,

06:08.618 --> 06:10.578
and we've also got this gingerbread house

06:10.661 --> 06:13.122
which is gonna house our tasting element.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.209
For the tasting portion,
I'm baking a carrot cake

06:16.292 --> 06:18.002
with a cream cheese frosting.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.672
So, tell me
why you used a triangular shape.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.675
I've used a triangular shape
because triangles are very strong.

06:24.759 --> 06:29.389
-And if you see, the base is very steady.
-[Sara] Hey, feel free to give it a shake.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.474
Maybe we will.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.726
I'm sure
you're gonna give it quite a shake.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.686
-[Joanne] Best of luck.
-Thank you.

06:35.770 --> 06:36.687
[Dr. O] Good luck.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.688
[clock ticking]

06:38.398 --> 06:40.233
-Those colors are gorgeous.
-Thanks.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.068
-[Taylor] Is that for leaves?
-[Cindy] Yes.

06:42.151 --> 06:45.571
I lived in Pittsburgh for quite a while,
which is where I went to school

06:45.655 --> 06:47.031
at Carnegie Mellon.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.866
I love California and Los Angeles,

06:48.950 --> 06:51.869
but Pittsburgh is the city
where I became an adult,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.871
is what made me me.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.998
-Oh, wow.
-It's like fall.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.083
That's so cool.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.835
-And this is wafer paper?
-Yeah.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.504
We're gonna build
a Pittsburgh-inspired cityscape

07:01.587 --> 07:03.714
where the Allegheny river hits
the Monongahela

07:03.798 --> 07:07.093
and you see this gorgeous,
triangular downtown area.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.555
We have an isomalt suspension bridge
we're gonna build in bright yellow,

07:10.638 --> 07:12.473
two edible buildings made of cake,

07:12.557 --> 07:15.393
and we've got all these details
that make it feel like a city.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.187
We'll have our skyscraper,
which is gonna be five feet tall,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.690
steel-inspired with exposed structure.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.859
The framing is exposed on the outside

07:22.942 --> 07:26.070
and is made up of individual bricks
with crossbars to add stability.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.864
Cindy and Taylor.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.449
-[Cindy] Hi!
-Hello there.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.617
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

07:31.701 --> 07:35.079
That's a pretty interesting module
in your hand there.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.083
Given that it has to be gingerbread
and that gingerbread is flat,

07:39.167 --> 07:44.046
I was thinking what shapes I can make
that are 3D out of a 2D shape.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.632
So, I settled
for this almost truss-like shape,

07:46.716 --> 07:49.427
where it's just a rectangle
with a crossbar.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.805
And then I alternate on each story
which side the crossbar's on.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.601
So, overall,
almost all the force should be going

07:56.684 --> 07:59.479
through these
really structurally-sound corners.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.816
-You made gingerbread bricks, looks like.
-Yes! Like gingerbread bricks.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.610
Have you made some sort of epoxy

08:05.693 --> 08:07.820
or are you using
any sort of mechanical joints?

08:07.904 --> 08:10.615
Yeah, so these are
gonna be extremely rigid,

08:10.698 --> 08:12.867
but then we'll use gelatin between layers

08:12.950 --> 08:16.245
and that'll provide
the stability for the actual shake.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.665
Cindy, what are you making
for a cake for us to try?

08:19.749 --> 08:23.127
So, I'm gonna go out my realm.
I'm going with a dark chocolate cake

08:23.211 --> 08:26.005
and a peanut butter,
Swiss meringue buttercream.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.966
Buttercream, not whip.
I'm gonna add a pretzel crunch,

08:29.050 --> 08:32.220
so it's gonna be a nice contrast.
A little salty, a little sweet.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.097
That sounds amazing.
And how does that tie in to Pittsburgh?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.432
[Cindy] Um, black and gold.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.809
Every sports team Pittsburgh has
is black and gold.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.727
It's kind of cool.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.146
-We will let you get back to work.
-Thanks, guys.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.398
Brandi, what's your theme?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.776
Our theme is a Japanese pagoda.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.194
Ooh!

08:48.277 --> 08:51.489
I wanted to do Kentucky,
but Menuka is over it.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.658
[both laughing]

08:53.741 --> 08:55.201
No, I didn't say that.

08:55.284 --> 08:59.038
We're going to build the pagoda
entirely out of gingerbread.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.958
And we're going to build it
like a pyramid shape

09:02.041 --> 09:03.876
with the five different levels.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.505
[Brandi] The landscape portion
will have Mount Fuji in the back

09:07.588 --> 09:08.756
created out of cake,

09:08.839 --> 09:11.842
a sake fountain in the front,
also created out of cake,

09:11.926 --> 09:15.012
some cherry blossom trees
using modeling chocolate

09:15.721 --> 09:19.141
and marshmallows rolled in tinted coconut.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.019
The dessert will be
an almond and fig cake.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.106
I had the idea of cutting the figs open
and baking them face up

09:25.189 --> 09:30.236
so it'll look like a cobblestone effect
to surround the base of the sake fountain.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.738
Get those pieces laid out
and ready to go.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.866
That way whenever the glue is ready
we can just slap 'em together.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.035
[clock ticking]

09:40.413 --> 09:41.539
[Renee] Is the gelatin ready?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.833
[Steve] This can go underneath the base.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.419
-That looks awesome.
-Yeah, so it's strong.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.632
[exclaims] It looks
like an octopus or something.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.635
Yeah. Hopefully, that'll take
the bouncing up and down pressure

09:54.719 --> 09:55.761
a little bit out of it.

09:55.845 --> 10:00.725
I'm excited for this mission
just on the structural aspects alone

10:00.808 --> 10:04.395
of creating a building
that's gonna withstand an earthquake.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.105
Try and move that.

10:08.024 --> 10:08.858
[Renee] Okay.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.820
So, that's gonna put the stability
between the shaker and your base

10:12.903 --> 10:15.323
so that does the shaking,
but this is the cushion.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.866
Mmm, mmm. I like it. Okay.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.577
We can cut pieces, like,
four and stack them up like this

10:19.660 --> 10:20.911
and put 'em in each corner.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.081
-Okay. Sweet.
-And then that's your rubberized base.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.002
-Steve, Renee.
-Hello there.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.211
How are you guys doin'?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.963
We're doing great, thank you.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.298
I'm curious, why Venice?

10:32.381 --> 10:34.467
We thought Venice because gondolas,

10:34.550 --> 10:37.053
the ocean,
more elements to throw in there…

10:37.136 --> 10:39.722
So, Steve and I are
building Futuristic Venice.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.266
We wanna stand out from the other teams,

10:42.350 --> 10:45.311
so we're going with
a all-green energy building

10:45.394 --> 10:47.980
powered by solar panels and wind energy.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.442
Our side buildings are
going to be an edible dessert

10:51.525 --> 10:53.319
that the judges are just going to love.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.782
It's gonna be a cannoli cake
laced with rum and chocolate chips.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.952
Is this going to sit on your platform?
So, is this the upper layer?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.288
So, this is gonna be the bottom layer.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.375
There's an identical piece
that's gonna sit on top of this.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.460
And there's gonna be oil in between.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.711
I see.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.798
That's the premises behind it.
If it'll work or not, I don't know.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.466
But oil creates less friction,

11:15.549 --> 11:17.593
which will give me
a sliding element going on.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.805
-Neat. You want it to slide.
-I want it to slide, correct, yes.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.308
So, hopefully, my building will do this
and the core will do that.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.186
-You're making a shimmying skyscraper.
-Exactly.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.979
[clock ticking]

11:31.399 --> 11:35.194
Teams, three hours
'til the end of day one.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.112
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.824
-How many of these do we have to build?
-We have to build 34 boxes.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.284
There's nothing
our magic glue won't stick to.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.162
We can hit it with a freeze spray,
it sets up really quickly.

11:45.246 --> 11:50.000
Royal icing's what you'd normally attach
gingerbread with, but it has a dry time.

11:50.084 --> 11:54.380
We also contemplated using chocolate,
however, chocolate cracks.

11:54.463 --> 11:58.384
And Menuka's very adamant
he wants it to have a shiftability.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.012
We can just take white chocolate
and pipe in strips like that down it.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.014
-Okay. Okay.
-That'll add reinforcement.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.602
[Steve] So, I'm putting the gelatin core
inside right now

12:08.686 --> 12:11.480
on a smaller version
of what would be the larger version.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.650
Let me let this set for a moment
and then I'm gonna go stand on it

12:14.734 --> 12:17.361
and see if we can take
200 pounds on top of this.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.365
As much as I have
from an engineering perspective, like,

12:21.449 --> 12:25.578
it sounds like you're really knowledgeable
in the structural building.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.538
It's almost like building a wedding cake.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.708
It's the same principles
that you have to have structural support.

12:30.791 --> 12:35.004
The pieces have to be machined
to a 90-degree angle on the corner

12:35.087 --> 12:36.714
so they come together properly.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.717
The supports inside have to be
exactly machined

12:39.800 --> 12:42.344
so you can build the next cube,
and the next cube.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.638
That is really my world right there.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.724
So, 200-pound stress test, okay?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.768
One, two, three.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.774
So, there's 200 pounds
on top of a two-inch by two-inch cube.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.525
That's awesome, Steve.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.069
[clock ticking]

12:59.153 --> 13:00.488
[upbeat music playing]

13:06.410 --> 13:09.497
[Taylor] So, what's your vision
for this tree during the stress test?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.916
I really hope that some fall off.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.919
-So that it's, like, legit fall, yeah.
-Fall? Yeah.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.546
Put a couple of loose ones in there,
in case they don't.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.798
[Taylor] It's so beautiful.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.966
Thank you. You're beautiful.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.177
-You're beautiful.
-You're beautiful.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.680
Hey, Brandi and Menuka!

13:26.764 --> 13:29.141
So, you guys won
the last mission. Congrats again.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.312
By doing that, you've won
an enormous advantage in this mission.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.439
I'm curious if you wanna hear what it is.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.440
-Yes!
-Yes!

13:36.524 --> 13:37.608
Yeah? Okay.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.153
So, let's just say
that all of your buildings are gonna face

13:41.237 --> 13:44.406
some seriously devastating shaking.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.659
However, Brandi and Menuka,

13:46.742 --> 13:52.373
you guys get to have your building shake
for half as long as your competitors.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.999
That's an advantage, for sure.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.254
It's gonna save us. This is gonna save us,
because we really need this one.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.508
Everyone else, stop shaking in your boots,
get back to work. Good luck.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.594
[clock ticking]

14:05.678 --> 14:06.720
Check this out.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.931
Oh my God, so cool. Love.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.936
I am not happy with this.
This is not working.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.940
We're gonna switch it up. I don't know
if we wanna keep going with the gelatin.

14:18.023 --> 14:22.862
I wonder if it's just too humid here
with, you know, these structures.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.073
The building is actually
held together with a gelatin mix.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.742
But some of the panels were sticking
with the gelatin

14:28.826 --> 14:32.037
and holding together very well
as a structure. I mean, they were sound.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.665
And then others were falling apart.

14:34.748 --> 14:38.294
And I'm realizing something's gone wrong
with the gingerbread

14:38.377 --> 14:40.796
and it's starting to
draw humidity from the gelatin.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.300
I don't think we have much time left
today. Let me clean these panels off.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.177
This one's not going together properly.
It's warped.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.139
Three minutes, teams. Three minutes.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.474
[tense music playing]

14:58.063 --> 15:00.274
[Steve] It's gonna take
every single second we have

15:00.357 --> 15:01.191
to pull this off.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.822
Ten. Nine. Eight.

15:06.906 --> 15:13.787
[Justin and judges] Seven. Six. Five.
Four. Three. Two. One.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.540
All right, bakineers,
that's the end of day one!

15:16.624 --> 15:18.459
You get to go get some sleep.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.711
So, wrap up your work
and we'll see you tomorrow

15:20.794 --> 15:23.339
for a rich, full day
of baking and building. Well done.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.925
[Steve] So, it's the end of the day
on the first build

15:26.008 --> 15:29.053
and we're not in a good place.
We're not feeling good about this,

15:29.136 --> 15:32.222
we're running out of time,
we don't have a structure.

15:32.306 --> 15:36.018
So, it's very worrying at this point.
We gotta figure this out.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.770
[tense music playing]

15:49.365 --> 15:52.534
[Justin] Good morning, bakineers.
You've got seven hours left.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.666
[Brandi] We got
most of the boxes built yesterday.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.169
Once we get those finished, you can
start constructing the gingerbread house

16:02.252 --> 16:04.213
while I work on our two cake pieces.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.172
Sounds like a plan.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.383
Ten minutes already passed.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.842
Goes fast.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.221
If it works, I'll feel pretty smart.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.099
If it doesn't work,
I'll still feel pretty smart, honestly.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.558
[Cindy laughing]

16:16.642 --> 16:20.062
For this skyscraper, we're gonna
be using primarily gingerbread,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.815
but, as an adhesive agent,
we'll be using isomalt.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.443
And as a shock absorber in the base,
we'll be using gelatin.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.197
From an engineering perspective,
the biggest principle I'm highlighting

16:30.280 --> 16:31.532
is base isolation.

16:31.615 --> 16:35.077
And I think that using a thick layer
of really, really rubbery gelatin

16:35.160 --> 16:37.413
will prevent the shock
from going like this

16:37.496 --> 16:40.958
all the way up the structure
and really keep it low in that base layer.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.960
You can do it.
If anyone can do it, you can do it.

16:43.043 --> 16:43.877
Aww…

16:43.961 --> 16:47.381
We can leave these together.
We're gonna use chocolate on the corners--

16:47.464 --> 16:50.050
Okay. Do you want me
to come over and help you?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.677
-Just get the chocolate hot.
-Okay.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.345
-Get rid of this gelatin.
-Okay.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.848
So, we're not using the gelatin anymore.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.933
The gelatin's not working at this point.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.061
So, we're switching it up
and we're going to use baker's chocolate

17:01.145 --> 17:03.439
as the structural glue.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.858
[clock ticking]

17:06.483 --> 17:07.818
That's really cute.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.279
It's my small cake.

17:11.655 --> 17:15.284
My hands are gettin' a little figgy.
That's so pretty.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.829
Carrot cake. It's my favorite dessert.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.748
-It's your favorite dessert?
-Yeah.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.333
Do you smell that?

17:24.918 --> 17:25.753
Victory.

17:26.837 --> 17:27.755
[chuckles]

17:29.923 --> 17:35.929
So, the pagoda, the way they work is
each level is separated from each other.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.849
So, when they moving,
they call it "dancing floors."

17:38.932 --> 17:41.268
So, I'm actually going
through the same process.

17:41.351 --> 17:45.272
So, I want to have each level
is not really attached permanently

17:45.355 --> 17:49.693
and have a flex, so they each can move
in a separate direction.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.781
I know this is gonna take more
gingerbread and more time to prep,

17:53.864 --> 17:56.408
but, in my head, this is a safe approach.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.452
Because, as you know,
in the ancient world,

17:58.535 --> 18:01.330
the only thing that survives
is a pyramid-shaped building,

18:01.413 --> 18:05.375
so I want to make a nice pyramid shape
and disguised as a pagoda.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.003
Five hours left!

18:08.087 --> 18:09.755
-[Menuka] Oh, my God.
-Five hours.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.091
[dramatic music playing]

18:15.552 --> 18:16.637
Gettin' tall.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.481
When we get this mission,
I realize we have an opportunity

18:27.564 --> 18:31.777
to use the rest of the city
as a dampening force for the tower itself,

18:31.860 --> 18:33.987
and the main goal is
to keep the tower upright.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.117
But what I'd like to do is to try
to get the park encasing the tower

18:38.200 --> 18:39.952
at least on two of the three corners

18:40.035 --> 18:43.622
so that extra cake
will absorb some of the shock

18:43.705 --> 18:46.291
and save a little bit more
of the base of the tower.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.753
All right, can I hand this back?
Okay. Thanks. Good.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.382
[electropop music playing]

18:53.465 --> 18:55.008
[clock ticking]

19:15.112 --> 19:16.530
[Steve] You see the white chocolate?

19:16.613 --> 19:18.615
-White chocolate?
-I saw it right here.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.713
Bakineers,
the quake is coming in one hour.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.259
[Steve] Coming over with the cake.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.017
You think we could make
a couple more gondolas?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.227
I'm gonna work on something
for the piazza.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.314
Judges, why don't you guys head off
and get ready?

19:50.397 --> 19:53.483
-Let's do it.
-Make sure to have a broom handy, I think.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.401
[Andrew chuckles]

19:54.985 --> 19:59.865
Bakineers, the judges are off
to construct a truly seismic stress test.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.366
Jesus.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.247
-[Rodolfo] Go easy.
-Okay.

20:15.005 --> 20:15.923
[Steve] I'll hold that.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.549
-That's in?
-[Renee] Press down.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.805
[Justin] You have five minutes left!

20:23.889 --> 20:26.016
[tense music playing]

20:28.477 --> 20:30.229
[Steve] Move on. Move on. How many?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.688
[Renee] I need one battery.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.111
You're doing great. You're doing great.

20:43.116 --> 20:48.413
[Justin] Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

20:48.497 --> 20:53.085
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.086
[klaxon wailing]

20:54.169 --> 20:57.214
Bolts and buttercream down.
Your time is up!

20:57.297 --> 20:59.049
-[applause]
-Oh, my gosh.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.760
-[sighing] Oh, my God.
-Oh!

21:01.843 --> 21:04.596
Bakineers, come with me.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.521
You know,
since it's our sixth stress test,

21:12.604 --> 21:15.148
we thought,
"Let's shake it up a little bit."

21:16.483 --> 21:17.776
[contestants exclaim]

21:17.859 --> 21:19.403
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

21:19.486 --> 21:20.696
What?

21:25.951 --> 21:29.538
-Wait, is that smoke or-- What was that?
-[Taylor] That smoke is wonderful.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.584
-[Justin] It's getting warmed up.
-[Taylor] Yes.

21:35.877 --> 21:40.716
Well, bakineers, what you're
about to face will be earth-shattering.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.427
[laughing evilly]

21:45.095 --> 21:49.433
The one key engineering requirement
of all buildings is they cannot fall.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.393
In this stress test, we'll be challenging

21:51.476 --> 21:54.021
the structural integrity
of your edible constructions.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.025
[Justin] That is
an earthquake simulation table.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.819
We call it The Bake Quake.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.779
Trademark pending.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.366
Now, each of your buildings
will have to withstand shaking

22:06.450 --> 22:07.868
in three incremental levels,

22:07.951 --> 22:12.205
for 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and
one minute without falling off the table,

22:12.289 --> 22:15.500
which I control
with this detonation system right here.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.422
Are the buttons isomalt
so you can push the edible?

22:20.505 --> 22:21.506
[all exclaim, laugh]

22:23.050 --> 22:26.553
-Oh, Brandi, that's a good point.
-Brandi, Brandi, Brandi.

22:26.636 --> 22:31.183
We'll start with a gentle shimmy
and go all the way up to the big one.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.769
Can you show us
what a gentle shimmy looks like, Andrew?

22:34.561 --> 22:35.854
[all laughing]

22:38.023 --> 22:40.150
We did have you put aside some cake,

22:40.233 --> 22:42.527
so, just in case
your buildings come tumbling down,

22:42.611 --> 22:44.446
we will have something to taste.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.698
I'll look at the integrity
of your structures.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.534
I mean,
this is Structural Engineering 101.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.330
So, I'm gonna be looking to see
how well your buildings survive

22:53.413 --> 22:55.540
our bake and shake test.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.084
[Justin] All right.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.586
Who's ready to shake and bake?

22:59.669 --> 23:00.670
Let's do it.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.301
First up, Cindy and Taylor.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.637
-Yeah!
-Give it up.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.724
Pittsburgh is a place with four seasons.
We wanted to highlight that

23:12.808 --> 23:16.061
in this build. In the far corner,
you'll see the entrance to the city.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.105
You go across our isomalt bridge.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.690
We have these awesome
modeling chocolate trees.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.901
[Cindy] The leaves
are made out of wafer paper.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.319
There's hundreds on there.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.321
The cake on the right is--

23:26.405 --> 23:30.033
The tasting portion's on the top layer,
but that's a chocolate cake

23:30.117 --> 23:32.661
and also the building on the back
is chocolate as well.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.373
For our skyscraper,
it is just about 100% gingerbread,

23:36.456 --> 23:39.668
with the primary exception
of gelatin on the bottom,

23:39.751 --> 23:41.795
hopefully dampening
a lot of the vibrations.

23:41.878 --> 23:45.590
All right! It is about time
to launch some destruction.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.884
Andrew, fire up level one

23:47.968 --> 23:51.179
in three, two, one.

23:55.350 --> 23:58.687
-Yep. Yeah.
-[Brandi] Yeah!

23:59.187 --> 24:00.522
[contestants applauding]

24:00.856 --> 24:01.690
[Joanne] Wow.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.942
-[Bake Quake powers down]
-[Justin] That's level one!

24:06.153 --> 24:10.157
You made it through all of ten seconds
of level one. Are you ready for level two?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.575
-Yeah.
-Yes.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.828
[Taylor] Oh, God.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.037
Oh!

24:17.456 --> 24:19.040
[contestants exclaim]

24:20.208 --> 24:21.209
Oh, my.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.253
[murmurs]

24:25.213 --> 24:26.965
[Taylor] Cake's gonna waddle off the back.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.677
-[Joanne] Oh, boy.
-Oh!

24:31.094 --> 24:32.345
[all] Oh!

24:34.556 --> 24:35.932
[contestants laughing]

24:36.933 --> 24:38.852
[Joanne] But the building didn't fall!

24:40.353 --> 24:43.398
Have you ever seen a cake walk like that?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.649
Wow.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.985
Not a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.154
[Cindy] It's not.
It's no longer beautiful.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.199
All right, well, Cindy, Taylor,
let's do level three, shall we?

24:52.282 --> 24:54.284
Which is the big one. Andrew?

24:56.369 --> 24:57.746
[Renee] Oh! The cake's walking.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.081
-Oh, no. There it goes.
-The cake!

25:00.707 --> 25:01.791
Oh, no!

25:01.875 --> 25:02.918
[all] Oh!

25:03.502 --> 25:04.336
[Brandi] Suicide.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.047
It's comin' out.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.382
Oh, God.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.592
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

25:13.094 --> 25:14.054
Okay. Okay.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.138
Go!

25:16.598 --> 25:18.099
[all exclaiming]

25:19.392 --> 25:21.853
[applause]

25:23.230 --> 25:26.233
Cindy and Taylor,
you ultimately did fail the stress test,

25:26.316 --> 25:29.736
but you made it 23 seconds
into level three.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.987
-Well done!
-[Renee] Good job.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.239
[Joanne] That's impressive.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.366
Let's taste your creations.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.910
[Cindy] I made
a dark chocolate cake

25:36.993 --> 25:39.412
with a peanut butter
Swiss meringue buttercream

25:39.496 --> 25:40.789
and a pretzel crunch.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.332
It is fantastic.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.961
-Thank you.
-The cake is rich, moist,

25:46.545 --> 25:49.464
light, but still very flavorful.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.926
The peanut butter Swiss meringue
I think is really well-balanced.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.637
But the fact that it's covered
in modeling chocolate,

25:55.720 --> 25:58.598
I'm definitely gonna leave
the modeling chocolate to the side.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.142
You did a great job
on the design today, visually.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.769
I love the isomalt bridge.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.689
I would say
the level of finish at ground level,

26:05.772 --> 26:09.818
then as you go up
was slightly stark in contrast,

26:09.901 --> 26:12.779
I think it'd be fair to say.
But overall, it's very striking.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.157
Your building lasted a bit longer
than I predicted,

26:16.241 --> 26:19.411
but, ultimately,
I think there was some really ingenious

26:19.494 --> 26:21.288
engineering elements that you included.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.291
I always thought the gel
at the bottom was a very good idea.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.459
-I'm really proud of you.
-Thank you.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.878
Cindy, Taylor,
thank you for the trip to Pittsburgh.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.088
-Thank you.
-Well done.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.675
Up next, Rodolfo and Sara.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.427
-Please carefully…
-[Brandi] Good luck!

26:37.387 --> 26:39.723
Rodolfo and I
were thinking futuristic cities,

26:39.806 --> 26:41.141
what do we want to be seeing?

26:41.224 --> 26:43.435
Immediately Barcelona came to my mind.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.604
Gaudí's crazy architecture everywhere.

26:46.187 --> 26:49.232
[Rodolfo] For the park,
we have a vanilla cake base

26:49.316 --> 26:53.570
and for the tree,
modeling chocolate and sugar leaves.

26:54.070 --> 26:57.866
We did two cakes
with gingerbread around.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.576
Coconut for the grass

26:59.659 --> 27:03.121
and a little pasta on the top
just to get a little higher. [laughs]

27:04.664 --> 27:06.708
-Rodolfo, Sara, you ready?
-Ready.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.044
Andrew? It's time for level one.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.090
[tense music playing]

27:21.890 --> 27:23.391
[cheering]

27:23.475 --> 27:26.061
-You think your skyscraper will survive?
-I hope so.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
-I think so.
-Let's activate level two.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.443
Oh, my gosh!

27:35.612 --> 27:36.655
[gasps] Oh!

27:37.405 --> 27:39.574
The house is falling apart.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.497
Oh, gosh!

27:48.792 --> 27:50.043
[Justin] It stayed up!

27:50.126 --> 27:51.503
[Brandi] Yeah!

27:51.586 --> 27:53.296
[Justin] We saw a little damage there.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.174
-Are you ready for level three?
-Let's do it.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.482
Solid.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.196
-Solid.
-[Joanne] It isn't going anywhere.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.989
Solid as a rock.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.283
Oh!

28:25.245 --> 28:26.454
Whoa!

28:31.042 --> 28:32.502
[cheering]

28:35.130 --> 28:36.464
-[Joanne] Oh, my God!
-Wow!

28:36.548 --> 28:38.550
-[Brandi] Good job, guys!
-Good job!

28:39.342 --> 28:43.596
Sara, Rodolfo, you have survived
everything we could throw at it.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.681
-Well done!
-Yeah!

28:45.557 --> 28:47.976
Now Andrew's just gonna
come kick it over.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.272
Congratulations.
Brilliant engineering, Sara.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.899
You had this internal reinforcement,

28:54.983 --> 28:58.486
you engineered your own epoxy,
wonderful job all around.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.657
Well, Rodolfo, Sara,
it is time to taste

29:02.741 --> 29:06.286
the cake construction that survived,
so let's cut it up.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.544
[Rodolfo] We did a cake inspired by Gaudí.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.297
He used a lot of vegetable and fruits,

29:17.380 --> 29:19.758
so I did a carrot cake with pecans

29:19.841 --> 29:22.343
and a traditional cream cheese.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.389
The carrot cake is really well-prepared.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.392
It is light, it's not overly-spiced.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.437
I might add
either a little bit more carrot,

29:32.520 --> 29:34.522
something to give it
kind of that juiciness

29:34.606 --> 29:36.232
I expect when I eat a carrot cake,

29:36.316 --> 29:38.485
something that's
just a little bit more moist.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.237
But again,
that's a very minor, minor point.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.655
Thank you.

29:42.739 --> 29:46.201
Rodolfo and Sara, I think this is iconic.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.496
It's colorful, it's bright.

29:49.579 --> 29:52.832
It grabbed my attention
when I saw it in its completed form.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.459
It really did take my breath away.

29:54.542 --> 29:58.588
Your… your candypoxy
clearly worked really well today.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.883
I think it's also
a testament to your design as well.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.803
Just putting two pieces end to end
with a good epoxy

30:04.886 --> 30:07.680
isn't gonna make a strong joint,
but you've thought about that

30:07.764 --> 30:10.391
and you built the internal structure.
It's very impressive.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.768
-Well done.
-[Sara] Thank you.

30:11.851 --> 30:12.685
[Taylor] Guys!

30:15.146 --> 30:16.773
[Justin] Up next, Brandi and Menuka!

30:16.856 --> 30:17.732
-Nice!
-Yeah!

30:17.816 --> 30:20.318
-Please carefully bring us that pagoda.
-Go, Brandi!

30:20.860 --> 30:23.571
[Menuka] So,
when we received this mission,

30:23.655 --> 30:27.408
my mind straight went
to the Japanese pagoda.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.745
[Brandi] In the front of the pagoda,
you have little shrubbery

30:30.829 --> 30:32.997
that's made out of the giant marshmallows,

30:33.081 --> 30:37.043
and then you have the sake fountain,
which is cake.

30:37.126 --> 30:40.171
I took pearl sugar and colored it.

30:40.255 --> 30:44.467
Then we also have
the cherry blossom trees, which I love.

30:44.551 --> 30:48.012
I made those with melted marshmallows
using shredded coconut.

30:48.096 --> 30:52.267
And then off in the landscape behind,
you can see Mount Fuji.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.687
And that is cake
with buttercream and snow sugar on top.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.481
The structure
entirely made of gingerbread.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.609
Now, let's remember,
because of the advantage you earned,

31:01.693 --> 31:05.238
you'll only be shaking,
rattling and rolling for half the time.

31:05.321 --> 31:08.074
Andrew, we'll begin
with five seconds at level one.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.454
[Joanne] Oh!

31:15.206 --> 31:18.501
Lost a few shrubs,
but structure's holdin' firm.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.461
Andrew, cue level two.

31:27.427 --> 31:30.179
-It's starting to weaken.
-[Brandi] Jeez.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.849
[Joanne]
It's going to separate.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.188
-[Brandi] Oh, my goodness!
-[Joanne] Wow!

31:42.191 --> 31:44.068
-Solid.
-Well done. Prepare level three.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.280
You have to withstand 30 seconds,
which is half the amount of time

31:47.363 --> 31:49.240
as your competitor. You ready?

31:49.324 --> 31:52.243
Yes, we're ready.
Go easy, Andrew. Go easy.

31:56.789 --> 31:57.624
[Justin] Oh!

31:58.207 --> 31:59.042
[Brandi] Aww!

32:00.293 --> 32:01.252
Oh! Oh!

32:07.884 --> 32:11.137
[Andrew] Oh, oh, oh! [groans]

32:16.851 --> 32:19.437
-[Justin] Yeah!
-[all cheering]

32:22.065 --> 32:26.486
You have successfully survived 30
seconds. Congrats, how do you feel?

32:27.028 --> 32:29.989
Like I wanna puke, maybe. Excited…

32:32.116 --> 32:35.036
Time to give the judges
a taste of Japan.

32:36.996 --> 32:40.708
So, I decided to bake
an almond and honey cake

32:40.792 --> 32:42.251
with upside-down figs.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.379
-Is it glazed with honey as well?
-No, it's--

32:44.462 --> 32:46.756
-There's just some sugar sprinkled on top.
-Got it.

32:46.839 --> 32:49.008
The cake is well-flavored.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.469
There's little bits of almond,
which I like.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.264
I wish that this had been
a little bit more adventurous.

32:55.848 --> 32:59.686
Maybe putting it in a tart shell
and then putting a little bit of cake,

32:59.769 --> 33:03.064
and then some of the fig might have
just elevated the dessert

33:03.147 --> 33:06.693
so it just showed off a little bit more
of all of the talents I know you have.

33:07.860 --> 33:11.781
I think you picked the most
ambitious design, architecturally.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.325
Most impressive to me is
how you bakineered this.

33:14.409 --> 33:19.455
So, you used your patented epoxy,
Menuka, which has worked a treat here.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.583
It's got elasticity so it's able
to absorb some of that vibration.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.753
That thick layer at the bottom
clearly did its job really well.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.297
If I was to give
some constructive feedback,

33:28.381 --> 33:31.843
if I put my hand there,
from the first three layers,

33:31.926 --> 33:34.762
I'm in Japan.
Oh, it's clearly gingerbread.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.015
Well done for completing
what you did in time.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.058
Perfect. A little bit unfinished.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.353
So, Menuka, I think
it was a brilliant technique.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.022
Your step pyramid design,

33:44.105 --> 33:47.025
it gave you sort of like
a dampening of energy as you go up

33:47.108 --> 33:49.235
and I saw that every single level

33:49.318 --> 33:51.029
was as solid as a rock,

33:51.112 --> 33:53.698
but they were moving separately.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.659
So, I love what you did
from an engineering perspective.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.119
Congratulations. Great job.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.912
-Appreciate it. Thank you.
-Thank you.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.831
Thank you guys very much. Well done.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.793
Up next, Steve, Renee.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.087
-[Taylor] Yay!
-[Rodolfo] Go get it, guys!

34:09.630 --> 34:12.717
[Renee] Welcome
to Futuristic Venice, Italy.

34:13.718 --> 34:16.179
In order to combat
the impacts of climate change,

34:16.262 --> 34:21.809
Venice has to go 100%
no carbon emissions energy.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.311
Such as the solar panels

34:23.394 --> 34:27.065
that are powering the inside
of the skyscraper itself

34:27.148 --> 34:28.608
and the windmills.

34:28.691 --> 34:31.569
Tower is gingerbread
with a support system inside,

34:31.652 --> 34:34.614
which is a crisscross system
between the layers.

34:34.697 --> 34:38.826
The two buildings are cake on the inside,
buttercream on the outside.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.662
The surrounding area
to the building itself is

34:41.746 --> 34:44.957
Rice Krispie cereals
covered with coconut flakes.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.210
The trees are made from chocolate,

34:47.293 --> 34:49.837
and the gondolas are
modeling chocolate made by Renee.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.507
-Steve, Renee, ready for level one?
-I'm ready.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.925
-[Renee] Ready.
-[Justin] Andrew?

35:05.019 --> 35:05.895
[Dr. O, Joanne] Wow.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.899
Let's take it to level two.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.696
-[Joanne] Got some movement.
-Here we go.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.208
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

35:34.632 --> 35:35.883
[applause]

35:35.967 --> 35:37.385
It's not gonna make it.

35:37.468 --> 35:42.056
A slight redesign has happened,
but you survived. How you feeling?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.684
A lot of that's held together
with gelatin.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.227
I had to switch up a little bit,

35:46.310 --> 35:48.813
because the gingerbread
was getting too soft.

35:48.896 --> 35:51.232
So, I switched up to some chocolate base.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.777
And I knew there was gonna be
a weak spot right there, and I was right.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.572
Maybe it'll take it right back
where it's supposed to be.

35:57.655 --> 36:00.116
-[Steve] It may do that.
-You ready for level three?

36:00.199 --> 36:01.033
Yep.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.415
Oh, gosh.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.504
Oh!

36:17.383 --> 36:18.342
[softly] Stay. Stay.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.891
[Renee] I just wanna catch it.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.976
[all] Oh!

36:29.770 --> 36:31.564
-[Steve] That one place.
-Wow.

36:31.647 --> 36:32.732
Oh, man.

36:33.691 --> 36:37.862
Steve, Renee,
your building withstood 38 seconds.

36:38.446 --> 36:41.532
You failed the stress test,
but we're excited to taste your cakes.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.583
[Steve] So, I made today,
to tie in with the theme of Italy,

36:50.666 --> 36:52.001
a cannoli rum cake

36:52.084 --> 36:54.587
with a European buttercream
on the outside.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.339
And what is the filling?

36:56.422 --> 37:00.301
It's a combination
of ricotta and mascarpone.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
A hint of rum and vanilla.

37:03.512 --> 37:07.058
-What's crunchy inside? Chocolate chips.
-Sorry, the chocolate chips. I forget.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.435
So, Steve,
I wanna start off by thanking you

37:09.518 --> 37:12.897
for covering it in something
other than modeling chocolate or fondant.

37:12.980 --> 37:17.109
Because if I'm gonna eat a slice of cake,
I want to be able to eat the whole thing.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.695
And in this case, I can and I want to.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.991
The sponge cake is really light,
I mean, it's almost like flying away.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.912
The ricotta and mascarpone
are really rich and creamy.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.748
I love the addition
of the chocolate chips,

37:30.831 --> 37:34.961
which gives it a little texture,
a little crunch as you're eating it.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.714
But, unfortunately,
the rest of the cake is a little bit dry.

37:38.798 --> 37:42.176
-Okay.
-It's so light, and, as a sponge cake,

37:42.260 --> 37:45.388
it really is meant
to soak up whatever liquid,

37:45.471 --> 37:48.057
so I think
if you were to make this cake again,

37:48.140 --> 37:50.559
just making a simple syrup with some rum

37:50.643 --> 37:53.229
would really not only
highlight the rum flavor,

37:53.312 --> 37:55.773
but also give the cake more moisture.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.735
Steve, this is like being in Italy.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.195
I love that ricotta filling,

38:01.279 --> 38:04.198
the chocolate chips give
a beautiful crunch. I'm an Irishman,

38:04.282 --> 38:06.367
so I could've taken more rum,
to be honest.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.326
-Okay.
-[Joanne laughs]

38:08.119 --> 38:11.163
Steve, I know there was some issues
with the material choice.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.373
You've said it yourself,

38:12.456 --> 38:15.543
where it split was where you had to make
that switch to chocolate.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.296
I think with a slightly
different ballistic gel composition

38:18.379 --> 38:21.215
it might've been
a little more humidity-resistant.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.383
Maybe a bit of glycerin.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.136
But all in all,
I think you've got a really nice design.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.263
You can tell
those units were well-designed.

38:27.346 --> 38:30.266
Even that one on the floor there,
it's still holding together.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.977
It was just those interfaces
which started to give way.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.938
Hey, that's what brings buildings down.
One flaw.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.064
[Dr. O] Steve and Renee,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.608
your building did not survive
our stress test,

38:39.692 --> 38:44.405
but I was immediately reminded
of how buildings in California are made,

38:44.488 --> 38:46.490
where you have a subterranean

38:47.074 --> 38:50.161
rollers that allow the building
to slide back and forth,

38:50.244 --> 38:51.162
and I looked at it

38:51.245 --> 38:53.998
at the very lowest levels
of our earthquake settings

38:54.081 --> 38:58.169
and I could see the base sliding around,
so I thought, "Yeah, that's really good."

38:58.252 --> 39:01.172
So, great job.
You didn't make it all the way through,

39:01.255 --> 39:05.343
but part of your building
is still standing, so, way to go.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.596
Steve, Renee, well done.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.513
Thank you.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.140
Thank you for Venice.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.351
Congrats. Awesome job.

39:13.976 --> 39:16.729
Our judges have
a very tough decision to make.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.565
Want me to take care
of your controller while you're gone?

39:19.648 --> 39:22.943
-I'll keep ahold of it, thank you.
-Okay. Why don't you guys go discuss?

39:23.778 --> 39:25.321
We'll sit tight.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.115
[tense music playing]

39:30.117 --> 39:32.286
[softly] At this point,
it's our sixth mission,

39:32.370 --> 39:35.289
and, like the skyscrapers,
our expectations are sky high.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.291
This one's really, really hard.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.294
They're obviously
both such talented bakineers.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.463
It's a really difficult decision.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.257
-I don't know what we're gonna do.
-Shall we flip a coin?

39:46.133 --> 39:47.176
Dr. O!

39:49.595 --> 39:51.347
I know we're in the bottom two.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.225
So, it-- Just--
How are they gonna judge this now?

39:54.308 --> 39:57.395
That's our main concern.
How is this gonna go?

39:57.478 --> 39:58.437
Judges.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.815
Are you ready for us?

40:00.898 --> 40:01.857
-Yes, we are.
-We are.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.652
Bakineers, follow me.

40:13.035 --> 40:13.869
Right.

40:17.289 --> 40:21.877
Bakineers. We like to call this process
"creative destruction,"

40:22.420 --> 40:26.424
and, from where I stand, at least,
you all were up to the challenge.

40:27.007 --> 40:29.844
A spot in the semi-finals
is on the line, everyone.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.848
And we're so sad to see
one of your amazing teams leave

40:33.931 --> 40:35.474
right before we get there.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.395
Four teams are left,
but only three teams will be moving on

40:39.478 --> 40:43.149
and one step closer
to winning the $100,000.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.820
Sara and Rodolfo, Brandi and Menuka.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.115
Congratulations.

40:51.198 --> 40:53.742
You will both be moving
into the semi-finals,

40:54.326 --> 40:59.832
but only one of you will be earning
a colossal boost in the next mission.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.501
To find out who that is,

41:02.585 --> 41:05.212
we're gonna shake things up
just a little bit more.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.298
[Bake Quake powering up]

41:12.553 --> 41:13.512
[contestants] Yay!

41:15.681 --> 41:18.100
[Sara] Seeing our name in lights
feels awesome.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.978
And it took a minute
for me to recognize my own name.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.481
I'm reading and going,
"Yes, that's actually us!"

41:23.564 --> 41:26.400
I honestly can't believe
we're in this mission at this point.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.569
And then we're in the semifinals! Ah!

41:28.652 --> 41:30.613
[Justin] Congratulations,
Rodolfo and Sara.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.366
You will now earn an incredible advantage
in the next mission.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.327
And that mission is pivotal,

41:36.410 --> 41:39.955
as it will decide
who makes it into the finale.

41:40.039 --> 41:43.542
Rodolfo and Sara,
I loved your use of edible materials.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.252
You had your own edible epoxy,

41:45.336 --> 41:47.963
you cleverly designed
a building with good joints

41:48.047 --> 41:50.966
and you used the cake at
the bottom to act as a bit of dampening.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.301
It worked flawlessly.

41:53.010 --> 41:53.844
[Justin] All right.

41:54.428 --> 41:58.098
We have two teams guaranteed
spots in our next mission.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.435
So, Brandi, Menuka, Rodolfo and Sara,

42:01.519 --> 42:03.437
why don't you guys go take a seat?

42:06.315 --> 42:10.528
Now, the question is who will be
joining them in the semifinals.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.155
Cindy and Taylor or Steve and Renee?

42:13.239 --> 42:15.282
[tense music playing]

42:15.366 --> 42:18.953
It was so hard
for the judges to come to a conclusion…

42:22.289 --> 42:24.750
…that they did not come to a conclusion.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.130
Neither of you are going home quite yet.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.927
The judges came up with another solution.

42:35.010 --> 42:38.347
You both have to face one more mission

42:38.847 --> 42:42.059
in order to earn
that coveted spot in our semifinal.

42:42.142 --> 42:45.312
Using everything you've learned
from the skyscraper mission,

42:45.396 --> 42:47.773
you have just two hours to build a house

42:47.856 --> 42:51.026
using your leftover gingerbread
from your skyscraper

42:51.110 --> 42:53.112
that is at least two feet tall.

42:54.363 --> 42:57.116
Then, we're gonna shake them side by side

42:57.199 --> 42:59.827
at the same time on The Bake Quake.

42:59.910 --> 43:04.790
The team whose house survives the longest
will earn a place in our top three.

43:05.916 --> 43:08.127
And, in the event of a tie,

43:08.210 --> 43:10.879
we will be determining who moves on

43:10.963 --> 43:12.590
based on your home design.

43:13.090 --> 43:13.924
[Rodolfo] Gee.

43:15.551 --> 43:19.847
Your final shakedown starts right now.

43:19.930 --> 43:24.852
[woman] Mission launch.
In three, two, one, go.

43:25.394 --> 43:26.395
Ooh! Watch out for that.

43:32.109 --> 43:35.529
Honestly, I can't believe
we're going up against Steve and Renee

43:35.613 --> 43:36.447
on a shakeoff.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.324
[Renee] My thin compartment?

43:38.407 --> 43:41.785
Steve is fast, and that's my biggest
concern going up against them.

43:41.869 --> 43:46.332
I mean, he can pull things out of nowhere
faster than we can even think of them.

43:46.415 --> 43:49.960
I wanna line these up
and make sure they all tie in properly.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.338
Okay. Yeah, I can cut these
on the band saw, no problem.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.089
We just finished a 15-hour build.

43:54.173 --> 43:58.010
We're tired, exhausted, and we don't know
what it's gonna be at this point.

43:58.093 --> 43:59.762
Stand back. Hot, hot, hot.

43:59.845 --> 44:03.015
But I know we can get it up
in two hours with the isomalt,

44:03.098 --> 44:05.851
and I'm pretty sure
the isomalt's gonna hold together

44:05.934 --> 44:08.646
and withstand the stress test
on the shaker.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.731
[Renee] We can always reinforce
on the outside,

44:10.814 --> 44:12.232
especially the bottom pieces.

44:12.316 --> 44:15.986
The bottoms should be reinforced first
and then the outside second,

44:16.070 --> 44:18.572
and then we should be good
from a structural standpoint.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.742
[Cindy] I'm making all the decor
out of modeling chocolate.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.036
-[Taylor] That's perfect in my mind.
-Okay.

44:24.119 --> 44:25.788
[Taylor] We're going for a simple shape

44:25.871 --> 44:29.375
and we're theming it
as King Neptune's vacation home.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.544
Do you think if I make seaweed
out of this we can attach it?

44:32.628 --> 44:33.462
-Onto--?
-Yes.

44:33.545 --> 44:34.588
I feel confident

44:34.672 --> 44:37.633
that both buildings are gonna last
for the whole Bake Quake,

44:37.716 --> 44:40.552
so it's important to make it gorgeous
in addition to strong.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.555
Fifty-eight minutes.

44:46.558 --> 44:49.645
There's no time for base isolation systems
and stuff like that.

44:49.728 --> 44:52.856
I just have to secure this thing
to the board the best way I can

44:52.940 --> 44:55.275
with the amount of isomalt
I've got left in the pot.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.902
That should hold it to the board.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.029
I'm pouring it down inside the building

44:59.113 --> 45:02.449
so it would run into the corners
and hold the building in place.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.701
[Brandi] Yeah, Steve.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.452
-Yeah!
-[Brandi] Put that roof on there!

45:05.536 --> 45:06.578
It's a rocket ship.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.789
-It looks like it.
-Yes.

45:08.872 --> 45:12.209
Oh! 'Cause you're an aerospace engineer!

45:12.292 --> 45:13.752
[Steve] When I hold it up,
push it on.

45:13.836 --> 45:14.795
[Renee] Okay.

45:15.379 --> 45:19.133
-And I'll border around it.
-Steve, Renee, how you feelin'?

45:19.216 --> 45:21.135
-Looking good.
-Oh, never better!

45:21.218 --> 45:23.178
-I think they're lying.
-That was sarcasm.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.264
[clock ticking]

45:27.683 --> 45:30.102
That looks right. My grandma's recipe.

45:30.185 --> 45:33.689
On the fly, I need a way
to attach our structure to the base.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.650
In order to succeed in this Bake Quake
against Steve and Renee,

45:36.734 --> 45:39.611
I need to make sure our building
is attached to the base strong,

45:39.695 --> 45:44.491
and isomalt is gonna be way too brittle,
so, I'm making a edible epoxy situation

45:44.575 --> 45:48.203
that's based on marshmallows.
Marshmallows are very, very springy,

45:48.287 --> 45:50.998
so hopefully they can
absorb vibration just like gelatin.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.625
Then I'm adding in some gummy bears
and coating chocolate

45:53.709 --> 45:55.586
to really adhere to the gingerbread.

45:55.669 --> 45:57.296
I'm gonna tilt this towards you.

45:57.379 --> 45:58.756
-Can you support it?
-[Cindy] Yep.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.716
This is on-the-fly engineering.

46:00.799 --> 46:02.801
I'm pretty sure this is gonna work,

46:02.885 --> 46:06.388
but I'm basically taking sticky things
and just putting them in the microwave.

46:06.472 --> 46:07.598
Thirty seconds!

46:09.349 --> 46:11.685
-Come on!
-Last touches.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.729
[Sara] Killin' it, Cindy!

46:13.812 --> 46:15.272
-Come on, guys!
-Come on!

46:15.355 --> 46:20.152
Five, four, three, two, one!

46:21.361 --> 46:25.491
[Justin] Time is up!
Chocolate and chisels down!

46:25.991 --> 46:26.825
[Renee] Wow.

46:28.368 --> 46:30.412
[Taylor] This is
the most emotionally, physically,

46:30.496 --> 46:33.332
and mentally exhausted we've been
this whole competition.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.376
I mean, we put in 100%
and then a couple hours later,

46:36.460 --> 46:38.337
we put in 100% again.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.924
And I'm just hoping that we are able
to stay to create for another day.

46:43.509 --> 46:47.763
So, bakineers, you already know
what it is you're about to face.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.390
It is sitting right here in front of you.

46:50.891 --> 46:54.770
The house that stands up the longest
earns a spot in the top three.

46:54.853 --> 46:57.773
If it comes down to a tie or the same
number of pieces are lost,

46:57.856 --> 46:59.274
we'll be judging you on design.

46:59.358 --> 47:04.071
A spot in the top three
is literally on the table.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.991
Cindy and Taylor,
Steve and Renee, are you ready?

47:08.075 --> 47:08.992
Let's do it.

47:09.076 --> 47:12.371
This is for a spot in the semifinals.

47:12.454 --> 47:14.957
-Andrew, you ready?
-Yes, I am.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.751
In three, two, one.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.694
[Justin] We started with nine teams.

47:44.278 --> 47:47.364
Only one can walk away with $100,000.

47:47.447 --> 47:49.950
I'm sorry to say,
this was your final mission.

47:50.450 --> 47:51.410
Phew!

47:52.828 --> 47:53.871
We have to build a car.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.960
The champions of Baking Impossible are…

48:04.381 --> 48:06.383
