00:13.488 --> 00:40.212
 UK as we look at the outlook for  Tonight, Richard tries to start

00:40.252 --> 00:44.492
 Your applause is very kind  because since we were last here,

00:44.532 --> 00:47.120
 In order to reflect that doom and despondency, 

00:47.160 --> 00:50.232
 we obviously had to make some changes in this series. 

00:50.272 --> 00:53.840
 So coming up now, what we have is a- taster of what you can expect, 

00:53.880 --> 01:05.324
 some of the down-to-earth real-world stuff, over the next seven weeks. 

01:05.364 --> 01:11.356
 Get out of my way, Frenchists! 

01:11.396 --> 01:16.416
 How is that happening?! 

01:16.456 --> 01:21.948
They're hot for James May right now. 

01:21.988 --> 01:28.384
 What do we want? Aston Martin! 

01:28.424 --> 01:40.260
 Dear God! 

01:40.300 --> 01:43.168
 Do you actually do anything to your hair? 

01:43.208 --> 01:46.200
 Well, I wash it. 

01:46.240 --> 01:52.232
 They're turning my car into a colander. 

01:52.272 --> 01:54.260
 What a pillock. 

01:54.300 --> 01:57.104
 Sand! 

01:57.144 --> 02:02.232
 I mended something! 

02:02.272 --> 02:08.039
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

02:08.080 --> 02:12.040
 Yeah, we messed that up, yeah...

02:12.080 --> 02:16.136
 Yeah, OK, we got... We got that a bit wrong, 

02:16.176 --> 02:18.512
 cos basically we drew up a list of all the things 

02:18.552 --> 02:23.512
 we're not supposed to do and then we just did that list of things. 

02:23.552 --> 02:27.120
 Yeah, but why not? We don't to doom and gloom, we do fun and games.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.572
 That's exactly right. So let's get on with this letter, which we have received. 

02:31.612 --> 02:34.416
 It says, &quot;Dear Top Gear, what would- your programme have been like 

02:34.456 --> 02:38.136
 &quot;if you were making it 60 years ago?&quot; 

02:38.176 --> 02:39.280
 Simple. 

02:39.320 --> 02:46.448
 Exactly the same. 

02:46.488 --> 02:53.888
 You join us in 1949 for a race. 

02:53.928 --> 02:59.356
 It's between the fastest car in the world, the Jaguar XK120, 

02:59.396 --> 03:03.356
 the fastest bike in the world, the Vincent Black Shadow, 

03:03.396 --> 03:09.056
 and this. 

03:09.096 --> 03:15.448
 This Peppercorn A1 Pacific Class steam locomotive is not the fastest train in the world. 

03:15.488 --> 03:18.824
 But because it was completed only three years ago, weirdly, 

03:18.864 --> 03:27.448
 it is the most modern train working in Britain today. 

03:27.488 --> 03:30.888
 So, the race. We would start at King's Cross in London 

03:30.928 --> 03:33.104
 and finish 400 miles away 

03:33.144 --> 03:37.480
 at the bar of the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh. 

03:37.520 --> 03:39.792
 The train would go on LNER's East Coast line, 

03:39.832 --> 03:43.696
 while the car and bike would go up the Great North Road, 

03:43.736 --> 03:49.076
 because it's 1949 and motorways haven't been invented yet. 

03:49.116 --> 03:54.668
 So all we had to do now was decide who'd go in what. 

03:54.708 --> 03:56.544
 Is this one of your special hats? 

03:56.584 --> 03:58.572
 No. Do you wear just this hat and nothing else sometimes? 

03:58.612 --> 04:03.200
 Just pick a piece of paper. Come on, Hammond, you go first. OK. 

04:03.240 --> 04:08.212
 That's the label. Oh God, yes. Arseholes. 

04:08.252 --> 04:11.280
 And? I've got... 

04:11.320 --> 04:13.932
 I've got the bike! 

04:13.972 --> 04:16.851
 There is a God. There is a God! 

04:16.892 --> 04:19.232
 That wouldn't really have worked. No, it wouldn't. Ready? 

04:19.272 --> 04:22.572
 May I? 

04:22.612 --> 04:25.684
 Aww... What do you mean, &quot;Aww&quot;? I'm on the train. 

04:25.724 --> 04:29.668
 I wanted to go on the train. 

04:29.708 --> 04:31.920
 I certainly didn't want to go on the train, 

04:31.960 --> 04:35.696
 because the Black Shadow was my boyhood dream bike. 

04:35.736 --> 04:39.604
I mean, as any biker will tell you, this thing is an icon. 

04:39.644 --> 04:42.948
 Just as all heavy-metal can trace its roots back to Led Zeppelin, 

04:42.988 --> 04:46.588
 all modern superbikes can trace their roots back to this. 

04:46.628 --> 04:48.448
 This is Genesis. 

04:48.488 --> 04:52.448
 It really is that important. It's going to be an honour to ride it. 

04:52.488 --> 04:55.244
 If I'm honest, I'm absolutely chuffed to bits to be going 

04:55.284 --> 05:00.620
 in the car, especially an XK120, because this is the car that made Jaguar. 

05:00.660 --> 05:04.920
 When it was launched, it was the fastest car in the world - it did 126! 

05:04.960 --> 05:08.512
 And yet, it was incredibly good value because it was £1,200, 

05:08.552 --> 05:12.244
 which in today's money, is about 35 grand. 

05:12.284 --> 05:14.104
 So you got a Bugatti Veyron 

05:14.144 --> 05:16.808
 for the price of a middling 5 Series. 

05:16.848 --> 05:19.640
 It's magnificent. 

05:19.680 --> 05:24.260
 As the others drooled, I was in for a shock. 

05:24.300 --> 05:27.368
 Hi there, how are you? Hi there, how are you. Nice to see you. 

05:27.408 --> 05:30.872
 So, is that where I'm driving it? 

05:30.912 --> 05:33.056
 Unfortunately, no. 

05:33.096 --> 05:34.776
 You're the other side. 

05:34.816 --> 05:36.528
 You've got the fire. 

05:36.568 --> 05:38.120
 What, I'm shovelling the coal? 

05:38.160 --> 05:48.056
 'I'd be shovelling a lot of coal -

05:48.096 --> 05:49.760
 'eight tonnes of it.' 

05:49.800 --> 05:51.840
 But even so, at exactly 7.23 and a bit, the race began. 

05:51.880 --> 05:53.872
 Go! 

05:53.912 --> 05:55.640
STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS 

05:55.680 --> 06:02.684
 I've got to get changed! I'll do that now. 

06:02.724 --> 06:06.776
IGNITION FIRES 

06:06.816 --> 06:09.588
 Jesus! 

06:09.628 --> 06:18.480
 Absolute piece of cake. 

06:18.520 --> 06:22.760
 Obviously, Hammond has to go and put his leather romper suit on. 

06:22.800 --> 06:26.964
 I've had to turn a key and press a button and I'm off. 

06:27.004 --> 06:31.996
 What a great idea the car was. 

06:32.036 --> 06:34.648
 What's the top speed of an A1? 

06:34.688 --> 06:37.996
 75. Is that all?! 

06:38.036 --> 06:41.244
 We're limited to 75. 

06:41.284 --> 06:45.308
 Why don't we do 100? They'll never know. Are there speed cameras? 

06:45.348 --> 06:48.852
 Yes. Yes. 

06:48.892 --> 06:52.040
 Finally, I was in my leathers and ready to go. 

06:52.080 --> 06:57.996
However, starting a Vincent is quite-tricky if you're a bit...erm, small. 

06:58.036 --> 07:06.604
IGNITION SPLUTTERS 

07:06.644 --> 07:11.776
 Listen to that. It's a straight six, beautifully balanced... 

07:11.816 --> 07:14.668
ENGINE SPLUTTERS 

07:14.708 --> 07:17.136
 This engine in one form or another remained in production 

07:17.176 --> 07:23.492
 until the mid-80s, that's how good it was. 

07:23.532 --> 07:28.288
All Vincent Black Shadows came with a bloke in a black leather jacket to start it, 

07:28.328 --> 07:31.560
 rather than just press a button, which is so ordinary. 

07:31.600 --> 07:33.184
 There's no sense of occasion. 

07:33.224 --> 07:37.888
ENGINE STARTS 

07:37.928 --> 07:42.528
 At race speed, the train needed 33lbs of coal every mile. 

07:42.568 --> 07:45.824
 Feeding it was a massive job. 

07:45.864 --> 07:54.668
 Oh no, I'm rubbish, I'm worse than rubbish! 

07:54.708 --> 07:59.888
 The fact is that Jeremy Clarkson, on this journey, is a stoker. 

07:59.928 --> 08:04.336
 I should think he'll be dead by the end of the platform. 

08:04.376 --> 08:06.212
 It's so hot! 

08:06.252 --> 08:09.824
 So noisy! 

08:09.864 --> 08:13.604
 If you want to know what it's like in here, get under your stairs 

08:13.644 --> 08:17.232
 at home during an earthquake and spend eight hours 

08:17.272 --> 08:25.040
 looking at your central heating system. 

08:25.080 --> 08:29.648
 Come on, coming through. Black Shadow coming through... 

08:29.688 --> 08:32.400
 'At last, I was on the move.' 

08:32.440 --> 08:34.491
 When this thing was born... 

08:34.532 --> 08:35.744
ENGINE SLOWS 

08:35.784 --> 08:39.996
 Oh no! Oh, oh God. 

08:40.035 --> 08:48.640
 A temporary glitch. 

08:48.680 --> 08:51.904
 I, meanwhile, was praying for a breakdown. 

08:51.944 --> 08:55.948
 But this was unlikely. 

08:55.988 --> 09:03.696
 The A1s, in the 1940s, could do 250 miles a day, every day. 

09:03.736 --> 09:08.684
 They can do 150,000 miles between services. 

09:08.724 --> 09:13.980
 They were phenomenally reliable.

09:14.020 --> 09:25.464
 That's just enough steam to get us about another five miles. 

09:25.504 --> 09:28.744
 Oh, you BLEEP! 

09:28.784 --> 09:30.560
 Yeah, yeah, thank you! 

09:30.600 --> 09:33.528
At last, again, I was on the move. 

09:33.568 --> 09:36.104
 OK, a few things to get used to -

09:36.144 --> 09:39.640
the gear lever is on the other side of the bike. 

09:39.680 --> 09:43.448
So at the moment, every time I wantto break, I'm changing gear instead 

09:43.488 --> 09:48.512
 and if I want to change gear, I'm breaking. It's not ideal. 

09:48.552 --> 09:52.200
 The brakes are the originals and surprisingly good. 

09:52.240 --> 09:58.572
 The only trouble is they're full of asbestos. 

09:58.612 --> 10:03.028
 Already, viewers, I'm at the beginning of the A1. 

10:03.068 --> 10:05.560
 Lovely, lovely, lovely. 

10:05.600 --> 10:10.324
 Everything's lovely in Jagworld.

10:10.364 --> 10:13.076
 The train, however, was doing even better. 

10:13.116 --> 10:17.512
 Where are we? Just gone through Potters Bar, so the M25. 

10:17.552 --> 10:21.136
 We've been under way 13 minutes and already we're at where the M25 

10:21.176 --> 10:26.244
 would be if it had been built, which it hasn't. 

10:26.284 --> 10:31.964
 Though the train had opened up a big lead, it would need to stop four times on the journey for water.

10:32.004 --> 10:35.980
 That would take time. 

10:36.020 --> 10:39.544
 Steam engines. They're beautiful things, 

10:39.584 --> 10:42.136
 they're romantic, the technology is fascinating, 

10:42.176 --> 10:45.808
 but they were already 20, 30 years out of date by 1949. 

10:45.848 --> 10:49.492
 It's all doomed. 

10:49.532 --> 10:51.308
 The car is the future. 

10:51.348 --> 10:53.280
 People can see it already. 

10:53.320 --> 10:55.200
 We've got a problem. 

10:55.240 --> 10:59.104
 We've got a problem! With what? We have a problem. 

10:59.144 --> 11:06.792
 We've got a steam leak somewhere, we don't know where. A leak? 

11:06.832 --> 11:10.260
 If the car had any problems, they weren't from 1949 - 

11:10.300 --> 11:13.040
 they were from 2009. 

11:13.080 --> 11:19.056
 Temporary 40mph speed limit enforced by average speed cameras. 

11:19.096 --> 11:23.104
 No-one working! 

11:23.144 --> 11:28.200
Finally, on the A1, the Vincent wasunleashed and hunting down the Jag. 

11:28.240 --> 11:32.464
I am now straddling my boyhood hero.- No, no, wait. That's not right. 

11:32.504 --> 11:34.920
 Between my legs... No. 

11:34.960 --> 11:38.904
 No, my point is, think what this was like 50 years ago! 

11:38.944 --> 11:43.480
There was everybody else, tootling around in Austins and Fords and God knows whatever 

11:43.520 --> 11:48.588
 dreary nonsense, and you comeharing along on a 125mph superbike. 

11:48.628 --> 11:51.588
This was so far beyond anything else.

11:51.628 --> 12:00.008
In fact, the Black Shadow remained the fastest production bike in the world until 1973. 

12:00.048 --> 12:02.932
 To fix our steam leak, we needed to get to our water stop 

12:02.972 --> 12:05.008
 in Grantham ahead of schedule. 

12:05.048 --> 12:08.716
 We had to fly and that wasn't going to be easy. 

12:08.756 --> 12:11.464
 You are now climbing to 25 miles. 

12:11.504 --> 12:12.920
 What, climbing? 

12:12.960 --> 12:16.808
 Yeah, it's uphill for the next 25 miles. 

12:16.848 --> 12:26.120
 Keeping this thing at top speed while going uphill meant the shovelling would be torture. 

12:26.160 --> 12:28.640
 Black Shadow, coming through. 

12:28.680 --> 12:33.212
 Traffic jams. Bad for the Jag, great for the bike. 

12:33.252 --> 12:41.152
 Where are you, May? 

12:41.192 --> 12:44.288
 My legs are like jelly! 

12:44.328 --> 12:48.716
 Eight hours of shovelling and plumbing. 

12:48.756 --> 13:01.104
 'If the shovelling didn't get me, the back draft of soot in the tunnels would.' 

13:01.144 --> 13:06.932
 Seat's nice, smells nice, view's nice, noise is nice. 

13:06.972 --> 13:08.716
 Morning, moderners. 

13:08.756 --> 13:15.604
 Meanwhile, far behind... 

13:15.644 --> 13:19.040
 This is what the Black Shadow was built to deal with. 

13:19.080 --> 13:24.336
 Continual, heavy drizzle. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 

13:24.376 --> 13:27.744
I love the bike, it's still my hero. 

13:27.784 --> 13:31.448
 Steve McQueen had one, you know. 

13:31.488 --> 13:36.416
 On the train, my furious shovelling- up the hill had produced results. 

13:36.456 --> 13:41.648
 Here's the deal. We're due into Grantham at 9.07 - 

13:41.688 --> 13:44.260
 It's actually 9 o'clock on the dot. 

13:44.300 --> 13:48.168
 We've got to be out of this station- by 9.20. 

13:48.208 --> 13:51.152
 So we've got 17 minutes to refill it with water. 

13:51.192 --> 13:53.008
 4,000 gallons? 

13:53.048 --> 13:55.528
 We need 4,000 gallons. 4,000 gallons. 

13:55.568 --> 13:58.980
 And fix that pipe. Yes. 

13:59.020 --> 14:01.088
 And, of course, while we were stationary, 

14:01.128 --> 14:04.980
 the others would be catching up.

14:05.020 --> 14:09.056
 Come on. We are in the world's fastest car. 

14:09.096 --> 14:11.792
 Peasant! 

14:11.832 --> 14:17.308
 I still ride bikes because it's a bit naughty. 

14:17.348 --> 14:20.512
 And this, the Vincent Black Shadow,

14:20.552 --> 14:23.336
 come on, it's the naughtiest of them all. 

14:23.376 --> 14:25.888
It is just a comic book character. 

14:25.928 --> 14:37.400
 Raif Montague-Smythe had a deadlysecret. For he was the Black Shadow. 

14:37.440 --> 14:39.604
 That's funny(!) 

14:39.644 --> 14:44.920
 'As the water flooded in, I took some time to inspect this incredible machine, 

14:44.960 --> 14:51.668
 'which has been made because no-one ever thought to preserve one of the original Peppercorns.' 

14:51.708 --> 14:56.480
 Then, one day, someone found the original designs in a skip 

14:56.520 --> 15:01.184
 in York. £3 million was raised and this is the result. 

15:01.224 --> 15:04.244
 It took them 19 years to build it.

15:04.284 --> 15:07.260
 19 years. 

15:07.300 --> 15:12.152
 And every single piece had to be made by hand. 

15:12.192 --> 15:18.104
 I mean, look at this beautiful RSJ. 

15:18.144 --> 15:22.384
 You know, if somebody rang me up and said, &quot;Can you make a spring that goes in there 

15:22.424 --> 15:28.964
 &quot;that's exactly the same as the one- that was fitted in the '40s, by hand, and for next to nothing.&quot; 

15:29.004 --> 15:44.120
 It's an exquisite thing. 

15:44.160 --> 15:45.260
 And another six hours running. 

15:45.300 --> 15:46.760
 I tell you what, I'll be fitter when I get there. 

15:46.800 --> 15:49.040
 I'm sure you will be. Fitter than I've ever been in my life. Or you'll be dead. 

15:49.080 --> 15:51.852
 Well, if I do, listen, fling me on the fire. 

15:51.892 --> 15:56.920
 Use me as fuel to beat Hammond and May. 

15:56.960 --> 16:00.280
 With the water loaded and the leak fixed, I rang James. 

16:00.320 --> 16:03.184
 May, how you doing? 

16:03.224 --> 16:06.356
 I'm about 30 miles from Grantham. 

16:06.396 --> 16:10.852
 30 miles south of Grantham? James, you're not even in the same century.

16:10.892 --> 16:13.728
 You are history, May. You are history. 

16:13.768 --> 16:15.792
 You're in the lead but not for long, mate. 

16:15.832 --> 16:22.384
 Trouble is, I'd have to stop for fuel, only I didn't know when. 

16:22.424 --> 16:25.920
 Now, this is worrying. The owner of this car has told me 

16:25.960 --> 16:28.920
 that when the petrol gauge reads a quarter full, 

16:28.960 --> 16:31.232
 it's actually empty and it's going to stop. 

16:31.272 --> 16:33.760
 And I've suddenly noticed that it's taken a bit of a dive 

16:33.800 --> 16:37.980
 and it's about that much above quarter. 

16:38.020 --> 16:43.888
 At the next service station, I chickened out and pulled in. 

16:43.928 --> 16:47.824
 That's already up to £13, 10 shillings and sixpence. 

16:47.864 --> 16:50.792
 In 1949, you could buy a house for that. 

16:50.832 --> 16:54.716
 'Inflation wasn't my biggest problem, though.' 

16:54.756 --> 16:59.368
Ha! I do believe I'm now in the lead.

16:59.408 --> 17:01.684
 Ha-ha, ha-ha! 

17:01.724 --> 17:05.243
 Because the Jag drinks fuel. 

17:05.284 --> 17:07.184
 That was a disaster. 

17:07.223 --> 17:09.136
 Come on, come on, come on. 

17:09.175 --> 17:15.288
 The game of leapfrog between the car and the bike was now on. 

17:15.328 --> 17:19.932
 But could either of us bring down the mighty Tornado? 

17:19.972 --> 17:21.964
 250 miles to Edinburgh. 

17:22.003 --> 17:27.280
 We just saw a sign. 250. 

17:27.319 --> 17:34.436
 We've got this one in the bag. 

17:34.476 --> 17:39.904
APPLAUSE 

17:39.944 --> 17:42.980
 Like I said... 

17:43.020 --> 17:47.696
 Exactly the same. 1949, exactly the same. 

17:47.736 --> 17:50.964
 Same old, same old. And we shall pick that up later on, 

17:51.004 --> 17:54.640
but now it is time to do the news. 

17:54.680 --> 17:58.824
 As we know, to try and shore up the car industry, the Government announced that if you scrap 

17:58.864 --> 18:05.464
 your old Singer Gazelle, you get £2,000 off the price of a new car. Why is it just cars? 

18:05.504 --> 18:07.076
 What are you suggesting? 

18:07.116 --> 18:10.260
 &quot;Dear Government, I've just found some rancid bacon in my fridge. 

18:10.300 --> 18:14.528
 &quot;Can I have a big pile of money to buy a shiny new lobster?&quot; 

18:14.568 --> 18:16.324
 Would it work for dogs? 

18:16.364 --> 18:19.888
 Cos when your dog's getting oldand incontinent and you have to... 

18:19.928 --> 18:23.888
 Peter Mandelson's going to come round and put your dog to sleep? 

18:23.928 --> 18:26.852
 He's not going to put it to sleep, he's going to kill it. 

18:26.892 --> 18:29.964
 Technically, yeah, that's what it...yeah. Any vets here? 

18:30.004 --> 18:32.904
 Cos, you know... You are a vet? 

18:32.944 --> 18:34.948
 No, a vet student. A vet student? 

18:34.988 --> 18:37.356
 Well, be careful because I found out the other day 

18:37.396 --> 18:40.384
 vets have one of the highest suicide rates in the world. 

18:40.424 --> 18:43.948
 And I know why. It's because, when you have children who love animals, 

18:43.988 --> 18:46.728
 they always say, &quot;I want to be a vet when I grow older,&quot; OK? 

18:46.768 --> 18:48.948
 Then they discover when they become a vet all they do is drive 

18:48.988 --> 18:54.668
 around the countryside all day, executing puppies. That's all you'll do. 

18:54.708 --> 18:57.572
 So, in fact, according to that theory, the only people who should be 

18:57.612 --> 19:01.356
 allowed to be vets are children who hate animals. Yes. 

19:01.396 --> 19:05.260
 You like animals? You're going to spend your life just boof. 

19:05.300 --> 19:10.416
 &quot;Here little girl. Is this your puppy?&quot; Boof. There it is. 

19:10.456 --> 19:13.244
 Have you chosen your weapon yet? What are you going to use? 

19:13.284 --> 19:16.056
 I'd have two in holsters. Yeah! 

19:16.096 --> 19:19.932
 Or a croquet mallet for somebody's tortoise that's not well. 

19:19.972 --> 19:21.888
LAUGHTER 

19:21.928 --> 19:24.588
 Sorry. We're going to put her off. Work hard and become a vet. 

19:24.628 --> 19:26.852
 Just don't kill yourself. 

19:26.892 --> 19:28.888
 I thought vets had the highest suicide rate 

19:28.928 --> 19:31.560
 because they're the only people allowed to have pistols. 

19:31.600 --> 19:34.852
 What's pistols got to do with it? Cos it's easier. 

19:34.892 --> 19:38.260
 Than what? I've only got a shotgun and it's quite long. 

19:38.300 --> 19:39.792
 You know, you've got to get your toe in it. 

19:39.832 --> 19:41.904
 If you had a pistol, you'd have shot yourself by now? 

19:41.944 --> 19:45.008
 Oh, years ago. Vet! 

19:45.048 --> 19:49.416
 I'm sorry but we have gone off topic slightly. Back to Top Gear. 

19:49.456 --> 19:51.184
 Can I talk about a car again? Yes, go. 

19:51.224 --> 19:53.824
 News of a new Skoda. Here it is. 

19:53.864 --> 19:57.288
 A version of the Fabia. They've called it the Scout, 

19:57.328 --> 20:00.076
 so presumably it comes with a 10p piece, a bit of string in the glove box, 

20:00.116 --> 20:04.920
and pitches up on your doorstep once- a year to ask for a pound to clean itself. 

20:04.960 --> 20:07.416
 I suppose every summer it goes off and stays in the countryside 

20:07.456 --> 20:12.212
 somewhere and is touched inappropriately? 

20:12.252 --> 20:14.588
 No, no, James... No, no, James... 

20:14.628 --> 20:18.464
 That's the Skoda Catholic Church. 

20:18.504 --> 20:21.056
 Now, we've gone off topic again, haven't we? Quite badly, yes. 

20:21.096 --> 20:23.088
 Now, we have some bad news. 

20:23.128 --> 20:25.088
 Dacia Sandero? 

20:25.128 --> 20:27.620
 Not the Dacia Sandero. Worse news.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.464
 The Peel P50 is no longer the smallest car in the world. 

20:32.504 --> 20:36.888
 Oh, no(!) How will that affect us all, in any way at all? 

20:36.928 --> 20:42.184
 You know those little kiddy cars that do that in motorway service stations if you put 10p in them? 

20:42.224 --> 20:46.776
 A man has taken one of those, put an engine in it and created this. 

20:46.816 --> 20:49.244
 Wow! 

20:49.284 --> 20:50.368
LAUGHTER 

20:50.408 --> 20:53.200
 I presume you mean the one on the right, not the Honda! 

20:53.240 --> 20:58.464
 Now, the only problem is he hasn't really left enough space in it for him. 

20:58.504 --> 21:02.152
 He's trapped himself, 

21:02.192 --> 21:03.964
 Locked in a tomb! It must be scary driving along, 

21:04.004 --> 21:09.996
 only knowing where you are by things that have gone past. And slightly to the side. 

21:10.036 --> 21:12.872
 I heard that. I can't even be bothered to look. 

21:12.912 --> 21:14.808
 I can't even be bothered to look.

21:14.848 --> 21:18.776
 We didn't say anything about, &quot;Richard Hammond's ideal car.&quot; 

21:18.816 --> 21:20.560
 Who said that? Now somebody back there has. 

21:20.600 --> 21:23.260
 Big fella here with the tattoos.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.948
 Getting off topic, just for a moment. I was driving here this morning 

21:25.988 --> 21:31.492
 and I noticed that my Mercedes said on the dashboard. &quot;Your service is due.&quot; 

21:31.532 --> 21:37.056
 I just thought, how Germanic and boring is that? It's very precise. 

21:37.096 --> 21:39.028
 Then I was thinking, what's going to happen on the 27th day 

21:39.068 --> 21:43.212
 when, inevitably, I still haven't had it serviced? 

21:43.252 --> 21:45.280
 MOCK GERMAN ACCENT: &quot;Cooler, three veeks.&quot; 

21:45.320 --> 21:49.544
LAUGHTER 

21:49.584 --> 21:53.436
 It's funny you should say this, because my little Fiat's overdue for a service. 

21:53.476 --> 21:54.840
 I was driving along and all of a sudden 

21:54.880 --> 21:58.648
 this picture of a spanner appeared on the dashboard. 

21:58.688 --> 22:02.184
 That's what it's calling you. &quot;You are a spanner.&quot; 

22:02.224 --> 22:04.288
 Is that what it is? 

22:04.328 --> 22:05.824
 So if I continue to ignore it like I am doing, 

22:05.864 --> 22:10.308
 it turns into a picture of the end of a bell or what? 

22:10.348 --> 22:14.572
 A map of Tasmania. A big picture of a male chicken. 

22:14.612 --> 22:18.684
 Now, last of all, I want to mention this. 

22:18.724 --> 22:23.104
 Land Rover has launched a mobile phone which they say is as tough as their vehicles. 

22:23.144 --> 22:26.604
 I've got a picture of it here. 

22:26.644 --> 22:30.200
 There you go. What I want to know is why is it covered in diarrhoea?

22:30.240 --> 22:32.104
LAUGHTER 

22:32.144 --> 22:35.668
 It is. Look at it. That is unquestionably excrement. 

22:35.708 --> 22:37.400
 Maybe they're trying to say it's tough enough 

22:37.440 --> 22:42.168
 to survive a trip through your digestive system and still be... Oh, my God. 

22:42.208 --> 22:44.572
 Look who's digestive system. 

22:44.612 --> 22:47.792
 Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Can we get this on here? 

22:47.832 --> 22:51.696
 It's actually Ranulph Fiennes' diarrhoea. It's been through him. 

22:51.736 --> 22:54.168
 What he's actually saying is, &quot;I was all bunged up 

22:54.208 --> 22:56.776
&quot;until the phone came out, and thatwas it, it opened the floodgates.&quot; 

22:56.816 --> 22:57.948
 Look at all this! 

22:57.988 --> 23:00.028
 You can see he's just come back from Nepal. 

23:00.068 --> 23:03.668
 He's in a lake of poo! That explains his pained expression. Look at that. 

23:03.708 --> 23:06.572
 Oh, dear. Do you think he passed the Land Rover as well? 

23:06.612 --> 23:11.560
 Oh my giddy aunt, he did, he ate his Land Rover. Anyway, that is it. 

23:11.600 --> 23:14.684
 Let's get a picture of Ranulph Fiennes' excrement off the screen 

23:14.724 --> 23:16.288
 because I want to move on. 

23:16.328 --> 23:20.640
 See, the thing is, when you're eight, everybody wants a supercar. 

23:20.680 --> 23:23.888
 But you can never really afford one- until you are 58, 

23:23.928 --> 23:27.168
 by which time your skeleton is too old and too creaky to get inside. 

23:27.208 --> 23:30.920
 There has never been a comfortable supercar. 

23:30.960 --> 23:33.120
 Bit like a comfortable guided missile. 

23:33.160 --> 23:39.280
 Until now. 

23:39.320 --> 23:43.904
 This is a new Lotus. 

23:43.944 --> 23:48.260
 It's called the Evora. 

23:48.300 --> 23:53.448
 While that makes it sound like a ladies dress shop in Harrogate, 

23:53.488 --> 23:59.212
 it presses all the right supercar buttons. 

23:59.252 --> 24:02.840
 The engine is in the middle... 

24:02.880 --> 24:04.492
 It's low... 

24:04.532 --> 24:06.356
 It's swoopy... 

24:06.396 --> 24:13.028
 and it's as agile as a water boatman in a kettle. 

24:13.068 --> 24:16.808
 Woo-hoo! 

24:16.848 --> 24:20.008
 Ha-ha-ha! 

24:20.048 --> 24:29.728
 What a car! 

24:29.768 --> 24:34.996
 Even by supercar standards, this is fantastic. 

24:35.036 --> 24:39.492
 Properly, properly fantastic. 

24:39.532 --> 24:43.544
 Right, I want to go in that direction, now I want to go in that direction, 

24:43.584 --> 24:50.184
 now I want to go there. This is amazing. 

24:50.224 --> 24:53.480
 This is handling by telepathy. 

24:53.520 --> 25:00.184
 I'm not steering now, I'm simply using the power of suggestion. 

25:00.224 --> 25:05.888
 There we go... 

25:05.928 --> 25:08.716
 Where this differs from a normal supercar, though, 

25:08.756 --> 25:12.212
 is what happens when you crash. 

25:12.252 --> 25:14.464
 O-o-oh, no! 

25:14.504 --> 25:15.560
 A-a-argh... 

25:15.600 --> 25:16.620
 Oh... 

25:16.660 --> 25:24.448
 This is not so bad. 

25:24.488 --> 25:28.620
 This car is so comfortable, that when you crash off the road 

25:28.660 --> 25:33.232
 and end up in a field full of buttercups, it doesn't really matter. 

25:33.272 --> 25:36.760
 You barely notice. If I were in a Ferrari now, driving off-road, 

25:36.800 --> 25:39.948
 my skeleton would be disintegrating. 

25:39.988 --> 25:44.604
 My torso, well, it would just become a big bag of mush. 

25:44.644 --> 25:53.088
 But in this, the suspension is absorbing the knocks, not me. 

25:53.128 --> 25:55.920
 Where is the track? 

25:55.960 --> 26:02.368
 It is extraordinary that a car which is soft enough to do this... 

26:02.408 --> 26:08.528
 ..is hard enough to do this. 

26:08.568 --> 26:10.980
 It's unbelievably good. 

26:11.020 --> 26:15.152
 It's the only car I've ever driven,- ever, which is a killer attack dog 

26:15.192 --> 26:18.888
 and an old sofa. 

26:18.928 --> 26:24.492
 That makes it perfect for the Saga-lout. 

26:24.532 --> 26:37.288
 And there's more good news. 

26:37.328 --> 26:40.980
 There are seats in the back for your grandchildren. 

26:41.020 --> 26:44.480
 Although they'll have to adopt the lotus position to get in. 

26:44.520 --> 26:47.980
 We have a boot which is big enough for all your cat food requirements, 

26:48.020 --> 26:50.872
 even if your cat is a tiger. I know what you're thinking now, 

26:50.912 --> 26:53.824
 you're thinking, &quot;Hang on a minute. 

26:53.864 --> 26:57.824
 &quot;If the seats are here and the boot's here and the front 

26:57.864 --> 27:01.088
 &quot;is all full of mechanical witchcraft, 

27:01.128 --> 27:03.560
 &quot;where have they put the engine?&quot; 

27:03.600 --> 27:05.464
 Well, I'll tell you. 

27:05.504 --> 27:11.648
 It's about here. 

27:11.688 --> 27:16.368
 The average supercar has a massive V1,000,000 engine that takes up all the space, 

27:16.408 --> 27:22.932
 but the ladies' dress shop uses a small V6 from the car you used to have - 

27:22.972 --> 27:26.760
 A Toyota Camry. 

27:26.800 --> 27:29.696
 So it's not the most powerful car in the world 

27:29.736 --> 27:33.200
 and its not, surprisingly, the lightest. 

27:33.240 --> 27:37.492
 Which means, of course, it isn't the fastest either. 

27:37.532 --> 27:43.088
 0-60 takes 5.1 seconds and you'd need an awful long runway 

27:43.128 --> 27:51.512
 to reach the top speed, which apparently is 163. 

27:51.552 --> 27:58.696
 Talk among yourselves. 

27:58.736 --> 28:02.260
 That's 140 and it's time to brake.

28:02.300 --> 28:07.792
 They're good. They're very good.

28:07.832 --> 28:13.996
 The thing is, though, it's a good engine. It sounds meaty- without being deafening. 

28:14.036 --> 28:18.184
 It's torquey too, and it's very economical. 

28:18.224 --> 28:22.212
 You should get 30 miles to the gallon. 

28:22.252 --> 28:24.932
 There are some drawbacks, though. 

28:24.972 --> 28:28.212
 The interior may be spacious and light but it appears to have been 

28:28.252 --> 28:37.088
 put together by someone who thinks a Porsche is the bit that sticks out from the front of your house.

28:37.128 --> 28:42.212
 Everything sounds and feels... 

28:42.252 --> 28:45.416
 a bit tinny. And there's more. 

28:45.456 --> 28:48.384
 All you can see in the dials is a reflection of whatever weather 

28:48.424 --> 28:50.588
 happens to be prevailing at the time. 

28:50.628 --> 28:52.416
 The buttons appear to be the result 

28:52.456 --> 28:57.356
 of some primary school painting competition and the sat nav system 

28:57.396 --> 29:00.640
 is so un-understandable, I'd simply remove it 

29:00.680 --> 29:06.560
 and use the space to store my Werther's Originals. 

29:06.600 --> 29:14.324
 As a result of this, some say you're better off spending your £50,000 on a Porsche Coxter instead.

29:14.364 --> 29:30.716
 Trust me on this one, though - you aren't. 

29:30.756 --> 29:34.260
APPLAUSE 

29:34.300 --> 29:38.336
 Nothing like an Elise. It's unbelievable. 

29:38.376 --> 29:42.244
 Very, very good. But... 

29:42.284 --> 29:44.200
 What? 50 grand. 

29:44.240 --> 29:49.904
 50,000? £50,000. It's a lot. I admit, 50,000 is a lot, 

29:49.944 --> 29:55.120
 OK, for a car made by turnip farmers out of melted down toilet seats.

29:55.160 --> 30:00.852
 But if you compare that to a Ferrari 430, and you can, it's the bargain of the century. 

30:00.892 --> 30:06.168
Yeah, but it's not as fast as a 430.- No, Ferrari 430 is here. 1.22.9. 

30:06.208 --> 30:11.008
 Now, we put that around earlier today and it did a 1.25.7. 

30:11.048 --> 30:14.512
 But look at that. Oh, we'll ignore that... 

30:14.552 --> 30:16.008
 Oh, that's awkward. The Exige was quicker. 

30:16.048 --> 30:17.840
 But it's the same as a five-litre Gallardo Spyder. 

30:17.880 --> 30:20.008
 A tremendous achievement. 

30:20.048 --> 30:22.480
 But we're not going to show you that lap, because instead, 

30:22.520 --> 30:26.840
 we've got something much, much more expensive. 

30:26.880 --> 30:28.308
 Yes we have and here it is. 

30:28.348 --> 30:30.668
 It's the Ferrari FXX. 

30:30.708 --> 30:35.212
 It's a bit like an Enzo except it has 860 horse power. 

30:35.252 --> 30:41.744
 Even though it costs £1 million, none of the 30 people who have bought one have ever taken delivery.

30:41.784 --> 30:45.668
 Seriously, OK, you buy this car and then Ferrari keep it at the factory. 

30:45.708 --> 30:47.920
 Yeah, they will take it to a race track so you can borrow 

30:47.960 --> 30:51.184
 your car for the day, then they take it away again. 

30:51.224 --> 30:55.448
 The point is, OK, since it's here and since we believe it could go very near to the top 

30:55.488 --> 30:58.728
 of our leader board, we thought that you would prefer to see 

30:58.768 --> 31:02.980
 this do a lap in the hands of our tame racing driver. 

31:03.020 --> 31:08.288
 Some say that he invented the curtain and that he recently 

31:08.328 --> 31:14.852
 submitted a £20,000 expenses claim for some gravel... 

31:14.892 --> 31:17.244
 for his moat. 

31:17.284 --> 31:21.544
 All we know is, he's called the Stig. 

31:21.584 --> 31:22.904
 And he's off! 

31:22.944 --> 31:25.492
 Lots of wheel-spin off the line but this car has lots of power. 

31:25.532 --> 31:28.464
 Almost as much, in fact, as an F1 car. 

31:28.504 --> 31:30.744
 First corner comes in fast, as it needs to, 

31:30.784 --> 31:35.964
 to keep the massive wing-generated down-force. Stig, working hard. 

31:36.004 --> 31:40.244
 No music, thankfully, because the FXX doesn't have a stereo. 

31:40.284 --> 31:42.244
 Just look at the way it glides round Chicago. 

31:42.284 --> 31:45.980
 It's like Batman on a track day. Hammerhead, now. How will it cope? 

31:46.020 --> 31:48.212
 I'm guessing well. 

31:48.252 --> 31:50.744
 But look how it reacted to that bump! 

31:50.784 --> 31:52.416
 I've never seen a car do that before. 

31:52.456 --> 31:55.480
 Is the Stig phased? Hard to tell. 

31:55.520 --> 31:57.336
 But let's assume not. 

31:57.376 --> 31:59.744
 Follow Through...surely, even with down-force, the mighty power 

31:59.784 --> 32:02.840
 of the 6.3 litre V12 means he'll have to lift off. 

32:02.880 --> 32:05.640
 I don't think he did! I don't think he did! 

32:05.680 --> 32:08.280
 So, just two corners left. 

32:08.320 --> 32:12.904
 Here we go. And look now, look at the brake discs glowing red hot. 

32:12.944 --> 32:16.572
 This is like a Formula One car. But with a windscreen wiper. 

32:16.612 --> 32:18.368
 Just Gambon left. 

32:18.408 --> 32:21.696
 Here he comes. Just flies through there, and across the line. 

32:21.736 --> 32:26.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

32:26.960 --> 32:32.668
 So the Gumpert, 1.17.1. 

32:32.708 --> 32:34.384
 Ready? 

32:34.424 --> 32:38.040
 1.17.1 to beat. 

32:38.080 --> 32:41.696
 The FXX did it 1.10.7! 

32:41.736 --> 32:46.212
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

32:46.252 --> 32:51.200
 What?! Blitzed it. Unbelievable, unbelievable! 

32:51.240 --> 32:52.436
 Staggering! 

32:52.476 --> 32:55.512
 Can we keep the doors closed? Why's the door open? 

32:55.552 --> 32:58.448
 Who opened the door? 

32:58.488 --> 33:02.448
 You can't come in. It's engaged. 

33:02.488 --> 33:04.604
 Is that the Stig? 

33:04.644 --> 33:08.544
 Why would he come in here? The Stig has come among us. I know what this is. 

33:08.584 --> 33:11.560
 I know exactly what this is. 

33:11.600 --> 33:14.088
 He was telling me the other day he's been fed up with newspapers, 

33:14.128 --> 33:15.776
 and I suppose internet geeks as well, 

33:15.816 --> 33:19.560
 speculating that he's a photocopier salesman from Bolton 

33:19.600 --> 33:22.212
 or that he lives in a pebble-dashed house in Bristol. 

33:22.252 --> 33:23.840
 There has been a lot of that going on. 

33:23.880 --> 33:26.996
 So he said, &quot;First programme when we're back on air, 

33:27.036 --> 33:32.416
 &quot;I'll come into the studio and I'll show everyone my head.&quot; 

33:32.456 --> 33:35.136
He said that? You don't think he's...

33:35.176 --> 33:39.572
 You think he's actually...? Who here wants to see that? Do you want to see that? 

33:39.612 --> 33:42.684
CHEERING 

33:42.724 --> 33:45.356
 They're not that bothered. Who wants to see the Stig's head?! 

33:45.396 --> 33:47.840
LOUD CHEERING 

33:47.880 --> 33:53.728
 So, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, the Stig! 

33:53.768 --> 33:55.668
CHEERING 

33:55.708 --> 33:57.544
 He's moving towards us. 

33:57.584 --> 33:59.416
 He's coming on the stage. 

33:59.456 --> 34:02.544
 Here he comes. 

34:02.584 --> 34:04.872
 Stand well back. 

34:04.912 --> 34:09.356
 If you'd just like to take a seat here please. 

34:09.396 --> 34:17.888
 The Stig, everybody! 

34:17.928 --> 34:23.512
 First of all, massive congratulations on that phenomenal Ferrari lap. 

34:23.552 --> 34:25.603
 We've never seen anything like that.

34:25.643 --> 34:30.368
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

34:30.408 --> 34:34.492
 I'm buying time here. Because this obviously is... 

34:34.532 --> 34:38.184
 it's a big moment. My heart's fluttering. 

34:38.224 --> 34:42.288
 If you want to do it, on your head be it. 

34:42.328 --> 34:46.027
 Remove your helmet. 

34:46.068 --> 34:49.232
 He's changed his mind. I knew he would. 

34:49.272 --> 34:51.840
 Go on. Be brave. 

34:51.880 --> 34:56.260
 Show the ladies and gentlemen that you're not a photocopier's... 

34:56.300 --> 35:03.728
 AUDIENCE: Off, off, off! 

35:03.768 --> 35:05.640
 They want to see. 

35:05.680 --> 35:07.384
 It's coming. Is it Susan Boyle? 

35:07.424 --> 35:12.512
 Is it Susan Boyle? 

35:12.552 --> 35:15.200
 Oh, my God! 

35:15.240 --> 35:20.076
 Stand up, stand up! Look who it is! 

35:20.116 --> 35:23.728
 The Daily Mail was wrong. 

35:23.768 --> 35:27.776
 Oh, my God. 

35:27.816 --> 35:32.776
 Oh, you've got a head, ears, you've everything. 

35:32.816 --> 35:38.668
 Have a seat, cos there's so much I want to ask. 

35:38.708 --> 35:40.852
 Where do we start? 

35:40.892 --> 35:47.980
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

35:48.020 --> 35:52.308
 Honestly, where do we start? 

35:52.348 --> 35:55.852
 First of all, did you really once punch a horse to the ground? 

35:55.892 --> 35:58.640
AUDIENCE LAUGHS 

35:58.680 --> 36:00.492
 Well, I did think about it, 

36:00.532 --> 36:03.368
 but I have a wife, she loves horses. I ended up on the ground. 

36:03.408 --> 36:05.948
 The Stig is married to a horse lover. 

36:05.988 --> 36:08.244
 We've established something. 

36:08.284 --> 36:12.588
 Whatever can I ask? Are you illegal in 17 US states? 

36:12.628 --> 36:18.416
 No, that's much too exaggerated. It's only nine, if I... 

36:18.456 --> 36:20.824
 Nine, illegal in nine US states.

36:20.864 --> 36:22.464
 I just can't believe it. 

36:22.504 --> 36:24.464
 Some people have told us that you only know two facts 

36:24.504 --> 36:28.980
 about ducks and both of them are wrong. Is that true? 

36:29.020 --> 36:32.152
 Well, obviously they don't fly. 

36:32.192 --> 36:35.932
 Yeah, they're right, you don't know anything about ducks.

36:35.972 --> 36:38.244
 I can't believe it. The other thing, of course, I've got to ask you, 

36:38.284 --> 36:40.668
 before you pulled on the white suit, before you were famous, 

36:40.708 --> 36:43.076
 what's your real name? 

36:43.116 --> 36:45.492
THEY LAUGH 

36:45.532 --> 36:53.716
 Come on, tell us. What is it? It's too amazing for words, all this. 

36:53.756 --> 36:57.760
 Well, you have to keep up some secrets. 

36:57.800 --> 36:59.356
 Come on, everyone, who is he? 

36:59.396 --> 37:01.384
 It's Michael Schumacher! 

37:01.424 --> 37:05.232
THEY CHEER 

37:05.272 --> 37:09.996
 And that's brilliant, because...

37:10.036 --> 37:12.808
 We've got to ask something about Formula One, while you're here. 

37:12.848 --> 37:17.356
 The question I want to ask first of all is, why is Lewis Hamilton all of a sudden coming last? 

37:17.396 --> 37:19.604
HE LAUGHS 

37:19.644 --> 37:22.056
 He was winning and now he isn't.

37:22.096 --> 37:25.824
 Do you know the answer? Well, it is- very difficult, occasionally, 

37:25.864 --> 37:27.904
 when the car doesn't work out. 

37:27.944 --> 37:34.840
And it's very obvious. Both of those-silver cars are not doing very well.- No, they don't work at all. 

37:34.880 --> 37:39.288
 This brings me on to an interesting- point about this year's F1 World Championship. 

37:39.328 --> 37:42.948
 Mainly, a big friend of yours, obviously, Ross Brawn. 

37:42.988 --> 37:45.368
 Because when he was at Benetton,

37:45.408 --> 37:48.480
 Benetton won. Then he went to Ferrari, Ferrari won. 

37:48.520 --> 37:52.336
 And now he's got his own team and Brawn are winning. 

37:52.376 --> 37:56.356
 So I don't want to be impolite with- this question, but was it the car? 

37:56.396 --> 38:00.028
THEY LAUGH 

38:00.068 --> 38:02.232
 Do you know what I mean? It's just,- when he was running the team... 

38:02.272 --> 38:04.872
 You're absolutely right. It is. 

38:04.912 --> 38:07.760
 The secret is what you do with you guys together. 

38:07.800 --> 38:10.088
 You're a team and it's always teamwork. 

38:10.128 --> 38:15.436
 If you squeeze out every little bit, that's whereyou're proved better than the others.

38:15.476 --> 38:19.888
 Is it true you had blood tests taken on yourself, obviously not during the race. 

38:19.928 --> 38:22.280
 It'd be impossible for a doctor to run alongside. 

38:22.320 --> 38:26.904
 But in the pit stops...? It's true. We did before the race, after the race, 

38:26.944 --> 38:28.308
 But in the pit stops...? It's true. We did before the race, after the race, 

38:28.348 --> 38:30.028
 in order to seethe development through a weekend. 

38:30.068 --> 38:34.008
 And then adjust the food and all of your supplements that you may have to take. 

38:34.048 --> 38:38.280
 Cut out the curries. I guess, cut out the curries. Hmm...yeah. 

38:38.320 --> 38:43.808
 Yeah, exactly. So when you look back, what for you- were the sort of great races? 

38:43.848 --> 38:47.212
 You know, I'm getting old.To remember back, all these races. 

38:47.252 --> 38:51.076
 I remember the Hungary one, when you had to do 25 effective qualifying laps. 

38:51.116 --> 38:53.528
 That was a great conversation with Ross. 

38:53.568 --> 38:56.640
 Ross coming on the radio saying,&quot;Listen, we are in this trouble now 

38:56.680 --> 39:01.136
 &quot;and we need, kind of,20 laps in these kind of lap times.&quot; 

39:01.176 --> 39:04.920
 And that sounded like qualifying.I said, OK, let's go, let's try it. 

39:04.960 --> 39:07.448
 20 qualifying laps, one after the other? 

39:07.488 --> 39:11.648
 I don't know, the combinationof Hungary was a special combination.

39:11.688 --> 39:16.888
 Track, car, everything just got together and we were able to do those times 

39:16.928 --> 39:18.244
 and it worked out. 

39:18.284 --> 39:21.932
 But we had many of those great events together in all these years.

39:21.972 --> 39:24.200
 Are you watching this year or have you sort of...? 

39:24.240 --> 39:26.668
 No, certainly, I'm watching. 

39:26.708 --> 39:28.728
I'm travelling to some of the races. 

39:28.768 --> 39:30.996
I see them live. And others on TV. 

39:31.036 --> 39:34.572
 And are you finding it a bit boring- when one person just endlessly wins? 

39:34.612 --> 39:37.200
THEY LAUGH 

39:37.240 --> 39:45.572
APPLAUSE 

39:45.612 --> 39:49.948
 When you were racing, were there any guys out there who you thought, 

39:49.988 --> 39:54.684
 &quot;This guy's pretty damn quick&quot;? 

39:54.724 --> 39:58.384
 Absolutely.I mean, I think my best time I had with Hakkinen, quite honestly. 

39:58.424 --> 40:02.964
 That was a period that I really like looking back to, 

40:03.004 --> 40:07.168
 because we had fighting up, really to the limit,to the maximum. And great situations.

40:07.208 --> 40:10.744
 And basically have a beer afterwards without problems. 

40:10.784 --> 40:15.008
 Who was rubbish? Hmm? Who was rubbish? 

40:15.048 --> 40:17.640
 You know, my English isn't so good, so... 

40:17.680 --> 40:20.980
THEY LAUGH AND APPLAUD 

40:21.020 --> 40:25.920
 Who was garbage? That's very good.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.088
 Have you got any regrets? 

40:28.128 --> 40:31.308
 When you look back, do you think, &quot;I wish I hadn't done that&quot;? 

40:31.348 --> 40:34.448
 I mean, in life, you always have regrets. You always do certain things 

40:34.488 --> 40:38.056
 that you think afterwards you could have done differently. 

40:38.096 --> 40:42.480
 And I'm sure you have someexamples for me. Yep. Three a minute.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.232
 No, it's just, I mean, let's be honest, you have a desire to win. 

40:46.272 --> 40:49.448
 That's my nature, yeah. 

40:49.488 --> 40:51.400
 I'm with you on that one. I play my son at chess. 

40:51.440 --> 40:55.824
 If it looks like he's going to beat me, I wait for him not to be looking and nick his queen. 

40:55.864 --> 40:58.008
 Which is the same as running into Damon. 

40:58.048 --> 41:00.448
THEY LAUGH 

41:00.488 --> 41:03.492
 You know, it's the sort of... You know what I'm saying. 

41:03.532 --> 41:08.728
 It's that kind of, &quot;I'm not going to let you beat me because I'm just better than you.&quot; 

41:08.768 --> 41:11.104
 Can I just ask finally before we move off Formula One, 

41:11.144 --> 41:14.088
 why did you stop? Because you were still winning at the end. 

41:14.128 --> 41:18.696
 What made you wake up one day and say, &quot;You know, I've had enough of racing in F1&quot;? 

41:18.736 --> 41:20.948
 Well, you know, 

41:20.988 --> 41:22.824
 curry was so attractive to me. 

41:22.864 --> 41:26.232
THEY LAUGH 

41:26.272 --> 41:32.400
 It's very nice, it is. It is. 

41:32.440 --> 41:37.368
 Nowadays, obviously the Stig duties- keep you busy, what, one day a week, I guess? 

41:37.408 --> 41:40.852
 What do you do in the rest of your time? How do you fill your days? 

41:40.892 --> 41:45.480
 Well, I have several areas that I fill up my time with. 

41:45.520 --> 41:49.572
 Being, obviously, a Ferrari adviser is one part. 

41:49.612 --> 41:52.212
And being a Bacardi ambassador for...

41:52.252 --> 41:57.088
 That's an interesting one. I heard about this. You're an ambassador for Bacardi. Yeah. 

41:57.128 --> 42:01.696
 A lot of girls here, yeah, a lot of ambassadors for Bacardi. They're nodding. 

42:01.736 --> 42:04.920
 I see lots of potential here. Exactly. 

42:04.960 --> 42:07.604
 The Breezers will sail through here.

42:07.644 --> 42:09.184
 Now, I think it's a great job. 

42:09.224 --> 42:16.200
 The thing is though, Bacardi have actually asked us to show a clip, OK, of you and not a drink. 

42:16.240 --> 42:20.544
 But here it is. This is the clip we've been asked to show. 

42:20.584 --> 42:27.668
 Opera singers. 

42:27.708 --> 42:31.492
 And then there's a man here with mud. 

42:31.532 --> 42:34.572
THEY SING 

42:34.612 --> 42:37.668
 That's wide. 

42:37.708 --> 42:42.480
 And then you get into another car and then crash into a cone. 

42:42.520 --> 42:45.604
 There. Now, there we are. 

42:45.644 --> 42:48.008
 Forget me on this, forgive me...

42:48.048 --> 42:50.948
APPLAUSE 

42:50.988 --> 42:54.728
 I have, quite literally, no idea what that's all about. 

42:54.768 --> 42:57.948
 Are they saying don't drive with mud on the window? 

42:57.988 --> 42:59.792
 Or don't drive with people singing? 

42:59.832 --> 43:03.324
 I mean, basically, we tried to put out a message, 

43:03.364 --> 43:06.384
 kind of almost the opposite of what you did on the North Pole. 

43:06.424 --> 43:10.168
 Don't drive with James May? I'll support that message. 

43:10.208 --> 43:12.324
 Leave the gin and tonic, I heard something. 

43:12.364 --> 43:15.648
 Is this a drink-drive...? We weren't driving! 

43:15.688 --> 43:19.728
 We were sailing. It was frozen oceans so we were allowed. So it's a drink-drive thing? 

43:19.768 --> 43:22.604
 What we're trying to get over is to the young generation, 

43:22.644 --> 43:26.668
 alcohol and driving is not really something that you should mix. 

43:26.708 --> 43:29.728
 And the campaign is drinking and driving don't mix. 

43:29.768 --> 43:32.620
 I mean, we don't want to stop people from drinking. 

43:32.660 --> 43:38.200
I have had lots of fun after racing in whatever championships with my mechanics and engineers. 

43:38.240 --> 43:40.620
 Who'd like to see some photographs of Michael? 

43:40.660 --> 43:43.336
 AUDIENCE: Yes! 

43:43.376 --> 43:49.168
 We may have a photograph here of a man who's entirely sober. There we go. 

43:49.208 --> 43:51.948
 There's another picture I'd like to show. 

43:51.988 --> 43:56.356
 Who was sick on this man? 

43:56.396 --> 44:01.776
 And what's that? A fridge. Yes, it's a fridge. You pushed it over. 

44:01.816 --> 44:04.288
 No, it must have been my brother.

44:04.328 --> 44:06.696
 So here's a clear message, everybody. 

44:06.736 --> 44:10.560
 Drink responsibly or you'll wind up looking like that. 

44:10.600 --> 44:14.324
 In a room with a fridge on its side.

44:14.364 --> 44:17.872
 Can we just talk about cars if, I may? What are you running now? 

44:17.912 --> 44:20.168
 I have a nice 500 Fiat. 

44:20.208 --> 44:22.948
 Is it the Abarth? Yeah. That's a fantastic car. 

44:22.988 --> 44:25.492
 It is. And you, actually, what do you drive most of the time? 

44:25.532 --> 44:27.872
 Family car, like a Croma. 

44:27.912 --> 44:30.336
 Fiat Croma? Yeah. 

44:30.376 --> 44:33.324
THEY LAUGH 

44:33.364 --> 44:36.840
 That's a fantastic bombshell on which to end this interview. 

44:36.880 --> 44:40.996
 Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Schumacher drives a Fiat Croma. 

44:41.036 --> 44:42.728
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING 

44:42.768 --> 44:44.696
 So there you are everybody, The Stig! 

44:44.736 --> 44:51.640
 The Stig, everybody! Thank you very much. The Stig. 

44:51.680 --> 44:57.288
 It was him, always. I can't believe- it. That was just a weekend gag. 

44:57.328 --> 45:04.512
 Anyway, fantastic, but tonight we are in 1949. 

45:04.552 --> 45:06.888
 Yeah, well, you're always in 1949.

45:06.928 --> 45:10.136
 Yeah, whatever. We're in 1949 and we are having a race. 

45:10.176 --> 45:14.400
 I'm in a Jaguar XK 120, which is the fastest car in the world. 

45:14.440 --> 45:22.168
 Richard Hammond is on the Vincent Black Shadow, which is the fastest motorcycle in the world.

45:22.208 --> 45:24.400
 And Jeremy Clarkson is on a steam train. 

45:24.440 --> 45:26.464
 Yes. Now the start line was here in London and the finish line would be up here in Edinburgh. 

45:26.504 --> 45:28.760
 And we have left the action, 

45:28.800 --> 45:31.152
 Jeremy was in the lead, just approaching Doncaster. 

45:31.192 --> 45:38.560
 I was in second place and as you would expect, captain slow was bringing up the rear. Steady. 

45:38.600 --> 45:40.744
 Hoping to take me from behind. 

45:40.784 --> 45:44.696
 Yeah, alright. 

45:44.736 --> 45:47.260
 And then press home his advantage and take Jeremy in the tunnel. 

45:47.300 --> 45:58.088
 Stop saying things like that. You know what I mean. 

45:58.128 --> 45:59.948
 Come on, come on. 

45:59.988 --> 46:02.852
 'To try and stay ahead of James, who was being cautious 

46:02.892 --> 46:05.464
 'with his petrol gauge, I was stretching my fuel stops 

46:05.504 --> 46:08.356
 'to the last possible moment.' 

46:08.396 --> 46:11.104
 Any minute now, this bike is going to start stuttering 

46:11.144 --> 46:12.776
 and I'm gonna have to pull... There's a lever down here 

46:12.816 --> 46:15.448
 to switch it to the reserve tank

46:15.488 --> 46:23.008
 and then I have to really panic about getting some more petrol. 

46:23.048 --> 46:28.088
 This is it! Doncaster, my home town, the home town of the original A1. 

46:28.128 --> 46:30.232
 The home town of the Mallard, 

46:30.272 --> 46:33.212
 the fastest stream train of them all, the Flying Scotsman. 

46:33.252 --> 46:37.872
 The greatest steam train of all.

46:37.912 --> 46:41.604
 That's my old girlfriend's house. 

46:41.644 --> 46:44.244
 I might have had sex in... or is that it? 

46:44.284 --> 46:48.604
 No, I think that's it there. 

46:48.644 --> 46:52.244
 Here I am. Grim-faced at the wheel of my Jag. 

46:52.284 --> 46:58.008
 Time for some overtaking. Tally Ho. 

46:58.048 --> 47:01.136
 I had no choice but to stop for fuel. 

47:01.176 --> 47:04.620
 As a result, James is going to overtake me. 

47:04.660 --> 47:06.212
 There's nothing I can do. 

47:06.252 --> 47:08.336
 'And sure enough...' 

47:08.376 --> 47:11.368
 Oh my word, it's Richard Hammond. 

47:11.408 --> 47:14.760
HE LAUGHS 

47:14.800 --> 47:19.888
 'Several miles ahead, I too was stationary, taking on more water.' 

47:19.928 --> 47:23.560
 Hammond, where are you? I'm about 30 miles south of Doncaster. 

47:23.600 --> 47:26.840
 Oh dear. We're in York. 

47:26.880 --> 47:31.728
 What? Where's James? He's just overtaken me but his Jag is drinking fuel, 

47:31.768 --> 47:34.996
 so with a bit of luck, he'll have to stop for fuel before I do. 

47:35.036 --> 47:36.872
 Or he'll catch fire? 

47:36.912 --> 47:39.120
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT 

47:39.160 --> 47:43.384
 What's that noise? It's me being told off not use a mobile phone by the man. 

47:43.424 --> 47:49.920
 Go and tell him it's 1949. So we can't have mobile phones? 

47:49.960 --> 47:53.932
 Yes! That was wheel spin on a 96-tonne train. 

47:53.972 --> 47:55.512
 That is a steam train, isn't it?

47:55.552 --> 48:02.028
 It's not got some nuclear device on board as well? 

48:02.068 --> 48:10.008
 'No. What it had on board was a fresh crew and that meant a fresh set of muscles.' 

48:10.048 --> 48:15.076
 Holy cow. The whole train is now really zigzagging. 

48:15.116 --> 48:21.904
 I got a tank slapper in a train at 75mph. 

48:21.944 --> 48:28.996
HIS BIKE CHOKES 

48:29.036 --> 48:32.168
 Three minutes early. We're early.

48:32.208 --> 48:35.996
 Three minutes? Yeah. You're doing a good job. 

48:36.036 --> 48:41.244
 'James was now in front of me, but my bold fuel strategy would keep me in the game.' 

48:41.284 --> 48:44.964
 OK. Settling into the cruise now. 

48:45.004 --> 48:48.512
 Looking good and going well. 

48:48.552 --> 48:54.716
 The bike running absolutely like a metronome. 

48:54.756 --> 49:01.436
 'Meanwhile, on the train, I'd been told I could cook lunch in the world's most fearsome Aga.' 

49:01.476 --> 49:04.028
 Who is on for a bacon sandwich? 

49:04.068 --> 49:07.280
 'It didn't go well.' 

49:07.320 --> 49:09.184
 Oh, no! 

49:09.224 --> 49:11.040
 Right up the chimney! 

49:11.080 --> 49:14.840
 So bacon just flew out of the top of our train? Yeah. 

49:14.880 --> 49:17.464
 Shove over, you dozy cow. 

49:17.504 --> 49:23.904
 'In a bid to close the gap on the Pacific Class Aga, James had become captain road rage.' 

49:23.944 --> 49:26.260
 Get in the left-hand lane! 

49:26.300 --> 49:30.904
 I'm trying to beat the train, you imbecile! 

49:30.944 --> 49:35.696
 Yay, look at that. That's good! 

49:35.736 --> 49:39.840
 'They told me that coal-fired eggs would be delicious. 

49:39.880 --> 49:43.588
 'They were lying.' 

49:43.628 --> 49:48.808
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT 

49:48.848 --> 49:54.668
 'Still, could be worse.' 

49:54.708 --> 49:58.168
 Quick summary of the turn my life has taken. 

49:58.208 --> 50:01.808
 I'm 20 miles south, not north, of Doncaster. 

50:01.848 --> 50:05.104
 I'm by the side of the A1. 

50:05.144 --> 50:09.604
 In the rain. The motorcycle is slightly broken. 

50:09.644 --> 50:11.448
 What I did was leave the fuel tap on, 

50:11.488 --> 50:15.028
 the reserve tap on, so the bike pulled a lot of slugs through 

50:15.068 --> 50:19.996
 from the bottom of the fuel tank, clogged up the left-hand carburettor and now has stopped. 

50:20.036 --> 50:22.648
 That's the situation. 

50:22.688 --> 50:25.728
 It is, however, a very manly pursuits, motorcycling, I'm enjoying it. 

50:25.768 --> 50:28.824
 Testosterone surging around my system. 

50:28.864 --> 50:32.308
 Or it could be rain, actually. It's getting in. It's rain. 

50:32.348 --> 50:36.168
 Surging around my system. 

50:36.208 --> 50:39.760
 'James was overflowing with Top Gear sympathy.' 

50:39.800 --> 50:42.280
 So, you're fine, but the bike is in bits. 

50:42.320 --> 50:44.920
 A bit. What a rotten bit of luck. 

50:44.960 --> 50:48.716
 If you don't mind taking your head and boiling it, 

50:48.756 --> 50:50.028
 that would be wonderful. 

50:50.068 --> 51:03.544
 He's had it. It's me and Jezza. 

51:03.584 --> 51:08.260
 'But this crew, with me shovelling,- were a match for anyone.' 

51:08.300 --> 51:13.588
 Hold tight. It's a little rough through Durham and the cathedral. 

51:13.628 --> 51:17.824
 Durham Cathedral. We're in Durham.

51:17.864 --> 51:23.920
 We're doing 75mph through the city centre. Oh, yes.

51:23.960 --> 51:28.744
 Don't know if I'm gaining. Keep calm and carry on. 

51:28.784 --> 51:31.400
 Ah, we're motoring now 

51:31.440 --> 51:33.492
 Wo-ho! 

51:33.532 --> 51:39.684
HORN SOUNDS 

51:39.724 --> 51:41.448
 'Ahead lay our biggest stop. 

51:41.488 --> 51:44.640
 'Half-an-hour in Newcastle to take on water and more coal. 

51:44.680 --> 51:48.008
 'But despite this, I was still confident.' 

51:48.048 --> 51:52.760
 We are so far ahead, it's embarrassing. 

51:52.800 --> 51:58.368
 'However, there was a surprise in store.' 

51:58.408 --> 52:01.776
 Now Black Shadow rides again! 

52:01.816 --> 52:04.544
HE SINGS A THEME TUNE FOR HIMSELF 

52:04.584 --> 52:08.808
 We could just throw in the towel. That's not the Black Shadow's way. 

52:08.848 --> 52:11.640
HE CACKLES 

52:11.680 --> 52:13.728
 'Then, as the train slowed for Newcastle, 

52:13.768 --> 52:16.136
 'there was another surprise in store.' 

52:16.176 --> 52:21.212
 Where are you now? We are you? about 20 miles south of Newcastle. 

52:21.252 --> 52:23.840
 20 miles south of Newcastle? Yeah.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.904
 You're going to go in the... 

52:25.944 --> 52:27.648
 Only 20 miles? 

52:27.688 --> 52:31.076
 Yeah. I'm gaining on you. 

52:31.116 --> 52:35.436
 The car's only 20 miles south of Newcastle. 

52:35.476 --> 52:39.744
 Bingo, bingo, here we go. 

52:39.784 --> 52:42.728
 So, we're stationary for 34 minutes? That's correct, yes. 

52:42.768 --> 52:48.184
 He's going to come past. He's ten miles ahead of us went we set off? 

52:48.224 --> 52:50.120
 We've some work to do, then. 

52:50.160 --> 52:52.964
 'Still, could be worse.' 

52:53.004 --> 52:55.416
 This, I think, is still that rain 

52:55.456 --> 52:58.604
 that we had left behind but I got caught up in it again 

52:58.644 --> 53:02.620
 because I was delayed having to rebuild my carburettor. 

53:02.660 --> 53:05.932
 As a result, getting quite wet. 

53:05.972 --> 53:07.776
 Very wet. So... 

53:07.816 --> 53:11.308
HE SINGS HIS THEME SONG AGAIN 

53:11.348 --> 53:12.668
 It's Saturday morning 

53:12.708 --> 53:19.056
 and the continuing adventures of the Black Shadow continue. 

53:19.096 --> 53:20.808
 'As I was loading the coal...' 

53:20.848 --> 53:22.560
PHONE RINGS 

53:22.600 --> 53:23.648
 Sorry! 

53:23.688 --> 53:25.308
 '..the phone rang.' 

53:25.348 --> 53:27.324
 James, what's happening? 

53:27.364 --> 53:30.964
 I'm terribly sorry, old chap, but I've just gone past you. 

53:31.004 --> 53:33.824
 You're in the lead? I am. 

53:33.864 --> 53:37.104
 Quickly, made millions of coals go in there. 

53:37.144 --> 53:41.560
 Enjoy your time in the lead because it will be short lived. 

53:41.600 --> 53:44.588
 What an appalling optimist. 

53:44.628 --> 53:50.232
 114 miles to Edinburgh. 

53:50.272 --> 53:52.544
 Both the train and the car had to do another stop. 

53:52.584 --> 53:56.288
 And from here on, big chunks of the A1 were single carriageway, 

53:56.328 --> 54:00.512
 so I wasn't popping the cork just yet. 

54:00.552 --> 54:02.852
 'However, in this stunning part of the world 

54:02.892 --> 54:08.416
 'and with the sun coming out, I was falling in love with the XK.' 

54:08.456 --> 54:11.168
 I'll be honest. When I first fired the old girl up 

54:11.208 --> 54:13.852
 I thought well, that's lovely, it's only a matter of time 

54:13.892 --> 54:17.040
 before there is an ignition issue, a carburettor issue, 

54:17.080 --> 54:21.324
 a bearing issue, but no, it's wonderful. 

54:21.364 --> 54:24.808
 The engine was designed in the evenings during the war, 

54:24.848 --> 54:27.260
 during the blackout, usually. 

54:27.300 --> 54:29.792
 The body was shaped by the boss of the company. 

54:29.832 --> 54:32.776
 The whole thing was completed in a matter of months. 

54:32.816 --> 54:36.280
 And look at it. I love it. 

54:36.320 --> 54:38.512
 And I will win. 

54:38.552 --> 54:43.416
 'Not if we had anything to do with it.' 

54:43.456 --> 54:49.288
 Come on! Ten miles! Ten miles! That's all we've got to make up. 

54:49.328 --> 54:54.964
 Dual-carriageway. Oh, God, this engine's good. 

54:55.004 --> 55:00.620
 Come on! Oh, yeah, we are working.

55:00.660 --> 55:09.008
 Oh, just give me a chance, just a chance. I'm in the fastest car in the world.

55:09.048 --> 55:13.744
 I'm doing this to beat a car. Why am I doing it? 

55:13.784 --> 55:16.588
 'Still, could be worse.' 

55:16.628 --> 55:24.244
HE SHOUTS IN PAIN 

55:24.284 --> 55:26.792
 Oh, the pain. 

55:26.832 --> 55:32.904
 South of Berwick, it was still neck- and neck. But James had a problem. 

55:32.944 --> 55:36.356
 Come on! 

55:36.396 --> 55:42.948
 Nobody coming out of this thing owns that Fiesta. 

55:42.988 --> 55:45.716
 This is what happens when you make petrol stations 

55:45.756 --> 55:47.384
 into supermarkets as well. 

55:47.424 --> 55:51.288
 People spend hours in buying bloody bananas and croissants 

55:51.328 --> 55:58.920
 and other things that you don't need. 

55:58.960 --> 56:05.572
 Yes, yes, in the car, in the car. Don't worry about the handbag. 

56:05.612 --> 56:09.996
 James's lengthy fuel stop was just what we needed to close the gap. 

56:10.036 --> 56:12.824
 But then... 

56:12.864 --> 56:18.480
 Where's the BLEEP water gone? What? Where's the water gone? 

56:18.520 --> 56:20.512
 There's no water getting to the boiler? 

56:20.552 --> 56:23.400
 We need to get water in the boiler now. 

56:23.440 --> 56:24.964
 It's not going to blow up, is it? 

56:25.004 --> 56:28.920
 Not yet. This is a worry, now. 

56:28.960 --> 56:31.888
 These are supposed to be full of water, 

56:31.928 --> 56:35.168
 but as you can see, there's just a tiny little dribble. 

56:35.208 --> 56:36.760
 There's water, but nothing's coming out! 

56:36.800 --> 56:39.212
 If we lose all the water, the fire has to come out. 

56:39.252 --> 56:42.888
 Otherwise we've got a disaster. 

56:42.928 --> 56:45.168
 I'm now about 65 miles away from Edinburgh. 

56:45.208 --> 56:48.076
 I can't get hold of Jeremy, he's obviously on the move. 

56:48.116 --> 56:50.648
 Too much noise for him to hear the phone. 

56:50.688 --> 56:53.696
 Now try it. Just lever in water. 

56:53.736 --> 56:55.620
 One of the water injectors that feeds the boiler 

56:55.660 --> 56:58.416
 had stopped working. 

56:58.456 --> 57:01.492
 We've got to ease up now,purely because we are losing steam. 

57:01.532 --> 57:03.728
 I need to shovel. Sorry? 

57:03.768 --> 57:13.464
 You want me shovelling?No, I need to shovel. I understand. 

57:13.504 --> 57:16.464
 The speed is right down. The water is right down. 

57:16.504 --> 57:18.872
 He's shovelling madly. 

57:18.912 --> 57:21.760
 And that means only 50mph. 

57:21.800 --> 57:28.448
 Should be 55, 60mph, until we can get it back. 

57:28.488 --> 57:31.152
 Temperature, oil, everything. No, it's fine, it's fine. 

57:31.192 --> 57:34.308
 Everything's fine. 

57:34.348 --> 57:38.088
 'After several tense moments, relief.' 

57:38.128 --> 57:41.056
It's coming back. It just came back? 

57:41.096 --> 57:43.288
 Cooled down and came back. 

57:43.328 --> 57:46.996
 You know how they say steam engines have moods? 

57:47.036 --> 57:50.368
 It was its time of the month for about ten minutes. 

57:50.408 --> 57:58.120
 The sea, we're going along the sea. 

57:58.160 --> 58:01.436
 'This was turning into a great race.

58:01.476 --> 58:05.212
 'For two of us.' 

58:05.252 --> 58:06.872
 OK. 

58:06.912 --> 58:08.308
 Time to get back on. 

58:08.348 --> 58:09.996
 My hero. That's a good thing. 

58:10.036 --> 58:12.448
 Um, just past Scott's Corner now. 

58:12.488 --> 58:17.308
 About 150, 160 miles yet to run. I can't feel my right hand at all. 

58:17.348 --> 58:19.056
 But this, you know, this is, 

58:19.096 --> 58:24.588
 this is a marathon, not a sprint. 

58:24.628 --> 58:26.620
 As we left Berwick for the final charge, 

58:26.660 --> 58:32.280
 the question was, had our injector problem given James back the lead? 

58:32.320 --> 58:37.120
 Hello. Hey, Clarkson, are you north or south of Berwick? 

58:37.160 --> 58:39.184
 North. North? 

58:39.224 --> 58:41.368
 Yes. You're joking. 

58:41.408 --> 58:44.120
 Yeah, but not by much. 

58:44.160 --> 58:45.964
 How far north of Berwick are you? 

58:46.004 --> 58:48.212
 Less than 10 miles. How far? 

58:48.252 --> 58:51.152
 Less than 10 miles. 

58:51.192 --> 58:55.904
 17? No, less than 10. 

58:55.944 --> 58:57.872
 30? 

58:57.912 --> 58:59.588
 Less than 10! 

58:59.628 --> 59:03.492
HE LAUGHS 

59:03.532 --> 59:09.336
 What a cock end, honestly. 

59:09.376 --> 59:16.744
Come on, Mr Clarkson, get shovelling. What? Keep shovelling! Sorry! 

59:16.784 --> 59:19.244
 Oh, God, the road narrows down to one lane. 

59:19.284 --> 59:22.716
 That's going to slow me down. 

59:22.756 --> 59:26.400
 Come on! Get more in it! 

59:26.440 --> 59:34.212
 I really want to win. 

59:34.252 --> 59:36.728
 Oh, God above. 

59:36.768 --> 59:40.308
 One of the farm lorries is overtaking the other one on the only dual carriageway bit. 

59:40.348 --> 59:51.684
 You selfish turd! 

59:51.724 --> 59:52.840
 What the hell was that? That's a wheel-spin. 

59:52.880 --> 59:55.056
 You've got wheel spin at 70mph? 

59:55.096 --> 59:58.492
 At 70mph! Yes! 

59:58.532 --> 01:00:02.840
 Where the hell's Jezza? I wish I knew. 

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.648
 We are now coming alongside the A1.- It's just here. 

01:00:06.688 --> 01:00:10.512
 Where is he? Where is he? 

01:00:10.552 --> 01:00:16.716
 This is as close as it's ever been.- If I see that green monster appear on the right... 

01:00:16.756 --> 01:00:21.212
 20 minutes, not even 20. 

01:00:21.252 --> 01:00:24.528
 Edinburgh. 116 miles, that just said. 

01:00:24.568 --> 01:00:28.716
 So it's still very much a three-way race. 

01:00:28.756 --> 01:00:32.280
 There can't be more than about seven or eight miles between us. 

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.076
 Oh, God. 

01:00:34.116 --> 01:00:38.056
 We've got a red. 

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:42.384
 No, it's not. It's two yellows, it's two yellows. 

01:00:42.424 --> 01:00:46.744
 What's happening is, we're following a stupid commuter train into Edinburgh. 

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:48.996
 He's stopping at every station. 

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:52.512
 He's stopping at every station, which is causing us to slow down. 

01:00:52.552 --> 01:00:58.104
 Less than ten miles to go. 

01:00:58.144 --> 01:01:02.464
 We'll ram it. Ram the stopper train.

01:01:02.504 --> 01:01:12.492
 He could have gone past. 

01:01:12.532 --> 01:01:16.416
 That's green, green. Go, go, go, go, go! 

01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:17.200
 We need acceleration out of this thing. These lights have really put us behind now. 

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:17.280
 Go, 

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:17.480
 Go, Go, 

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.776
 Go, Go, Go! 

01:01:22.816 --> 01:01:27.244
 Go, Go, Go! We need acceleration  It's a few miles,

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:49.776
 out of this thing. It is a few  miles following the city-centre

01:01:49.816 --> 01:02:14.168
 signs. Cole, fire, fire, steam,  I'm going to have to seriously run.-

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:46.588
 How do I get to the Balmoral Hotel?  Unlike James May, I will only run

01:02:46.628 --> 01:03:01.716
 You have permission to say a cock.  You should not laugh! Jeremy, speak

01:03:01.756 --> 01:03:09.448
 I never want to see another steam  train. Well done, mate, you did

01:03:09.488 --> 01:03:20.824
 very well, because that was man  contact. Have you heard from

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:30.932
 Hammond? Oh, God! The feeling is  coming back. God, that is worse! It

01:03:30.972 --> 01:03:37.696
 just hurts! What's that shows is  that even 60 years ago cars were

01:03:37.736 --> 01:03:41.728
 better than trains. That is not  really a bombshell, is it? I know

01:03:41.768 --> 01:03:48.056
 what is a bombshell. You will  probably wondering why Michael

01:03:48.096 --> 01:04:00.136
 Schumacher never did a lap in the  Suzuki. Well, don't worry, he did.

01:04:00.176 --> 01:04:08.872
 He has stalled! Oh, my God. Michael  Schumacher has stalled. He is off

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:13.336
 now. That is not good! He is  obviously not used to a manual. Oh,

01:04:13.376 --> 01:04:18.744
 no, here we go, first corner. That  is not the right line! That is

01:04:18.784 --> 01:04:26.964
 badly wrong. Look at the way he  holds that rien de as he heads

01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:33.620
 towards Chicago. He is not going to  make it, he is going off. Oh, no!

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:41.588
 He got the camera! It is OK! He has  smashed the windscreen. His E-flat

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:51.544
 have? No, I do not think he is!  Coming up to the tyres. He is going

01:04:51.584 --> 01:04:58.744
 the wrong way! Going the wrong way!  Here he is, final corner. Michael

01:04:59.305 --> 01:05:05.151
