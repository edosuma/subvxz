WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.587
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:03.587 --> 00:05.589
BILLY: I HOPE Y'ALL GOT LOSING
OUT YOUR SYSTEMS.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.841
COMING FROM THE COACH
WHO WALKED OUT ON US.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.218
KID: HEY, SNITCH.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.802
I KNEW SOME PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU

00:10.802 --> 00:12.638
HELPING THE COPS TAKE DOWN
TYRONE, BUT COME ON.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.057
SPENCER: WHO'S THIS?
GRACE: THIS IS MICAH.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.768
MICAH: I'M A TEACHING ASSISTANT.
YOUR MOM IS ONE OF OUR
BEST STUDENTS.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.061
YOU DATE ALL
YOUR STUDENTS?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.437
COREY: I'VE ASKED SPENCER
TO COME PLAY

00:20.437 --> 00:22.856
FOR ME AT SOUTH CRENSHAW.
GRACE: YOU WHAT?

00:22.856 --> 00:25.567
THIS NEW KID COACH COREY
BROUGHT IN FROM NEVADA
AIN'T NO JOKE.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.612
MAYBE CHRIS AIN'T
THE ONLY ONE ABOUT
TO BE REPLACED.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.031
COREY: YOU MY SON.
THAT AIN'T CHANGED.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.326
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
YOU NEVER CAME HOME.
NOW I KNOW.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.872
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
YOU NEVER CAME HOME,

00:38.872 --> 00:41.583
WHY YOU AIN'T MISSED
YOUR FAMILY.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.085
NOW I KNOW.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.170
YOU DIDN'T MISS US...
BILLY: SPENCE.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.840
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
'CAUSE YOU REPLACED US.
BILLY: EARTH TO SPENCER.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.634
COME ON, NOW.
YOU WITH US?

00:50.634 --> 00:52.302
SPENCER: YES, SIR.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.888
CHECK THIS OUT, Y'ALL.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:54.888 --> 00:56.890
WHATEVER HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY IN THAT

00:56.890 --> 00:58.892
7-ON-7 OPENER
NEVER HAPPENED.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.602
ALL RIGHT,
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.604
FLUSH IT.
MATTER OF FACT,

01:02.604 --> 01:05.107
FLUSH THE MEMORY OF Y'ALL
BEING STATE CHAMPIONS

01:05.107 --> 01:07.818
BECAUSE TODAY
WE START OVER.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.238
TODAY WE START ANEW.
TODAY WE HAVE A CLEAN SLATE.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.739
COREY: NO CLEAN SLATE!

01:12.739 --> 01:15.242
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO EVER FORGET

01:15.242 --> 01:18.578
THE WAY YOU FELT THE DAY
YOU LOST THAT STATE TITLE,

01:18.578 --> 01:21.456
WATCHING BEVERLY
CELEBRATE ON YOUR FIELD!

01:21.456 --> 01:25.002
NOW YOU TAKE ALL THOSE MOMENTS
AND LET THAT BE THE FUEL

01:25.002 --> 01:28.839
TO STEER YOU BACK
TO RECLAIMING THAT STATE TITLE!

01:28.839 --> 01:30.549
ASHER: COACH.
BILLY: SURE?

01:30.549 --> 01:31.758
WHAT ABOUT CAPTAINS?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.385
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
TRADITION

01:33.385 --> 01:34.803
TO NAME THEM BEFORE
SPRING LEAGUE.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.305
NOT THIS YEAR.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.308
NOT UNTIL I SEE
A FEW OF Y'ALL STEP UP

01:39.308 --> 01:42.728
AND HOLD YOUR TEAMMATES
ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISSING
PRACTICES.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.771
NOW BRING IT IN SO WE
CAN GET BACK TO WORK.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.566
NEW CHANT ON 3.
1, 2, 3.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.276
COREY: NEVER LOSE, NEVER AGAIN!
TEAM: NEVER LOSE, NEVER AGAIN!

01:49.276 --> 01:51.028
COREY: FROM HERE ON OUT!
TEAM: FROM HERE ON OUT!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.863
COREY: LET'S GET THAT WIN!
TEAM: LET'S GET THAT WIN!

01:52.863 --> 01:55.073
COREY: WHOSE HOUSE?
TEAM: SOUTH CRENSHAW!

01:55.073 --> 01:57.909
COREY: LET'S GO, BABY.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.287
BILLY: FASTER. FASTER.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.788
COREY: COME ON NOW!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.124
BRING IT TO ME.
GO! GO NOW. GOOD WORK.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.169
BILLY: THAT'S BAD.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.837
COREY: COME ON NOW.
BILLY: GET IT, GET IT, GET IT.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.714

03:18.657 --> 03:20.033
I THREW 4 TOUCHDOWNS

03:20.033 --> 03:21.493
THAT'S PRETTY STRONG

03:21.493 --> 03:22.702

03:41.138 --> 03:43.390
THIS IS MY DAD,

03:48.812 --> 03:50.313
MOSELY CAPITAL, RIGHT?

03:50.313 --> 03:52.232
OH, SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH MY WORK.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.568
MY MOM'S TAKING A COURSE
ON URBAN PLANNING.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.486
SHE LISTENS TO ALL
YOUR PODCASTS.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.989
"FIND OUT WHERE PEOPLE
ARE GOING AND BUY THE LAND
BEFORE THEY GET THERE"--

03:58.989 --> 04:00.740
ONE OF HER
FAVORITE QUOTES.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.910
YEAH, MINE, TOO.
NICE JOB OUT THERE
TODAY, SPENCER.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.662
SPENCER: THANK YOU.
CLIFF: WE GOT TO GET THAT DINNER

04:05.662 --> 04:07.539

OF THESE NIGHTS.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.541
CLIFF: UM, EXCUSE ME.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.917
YES, SIR.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.336
AS IF MY DAD
COULD NOT BE
MORE IMPRESSED.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.714
ALL HE TALKS
ABOUT IS HOW YOU
SINGLEHANDEDLY

04:15.714 --> 04:17.424
CHANGED THE CULTURE
AT BEVERLY.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.134
NO. WE ALL DID.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.094
JUST A SMALL PART
OF THE WAVE.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.346
SURE ABOUT THAT?
'CAUSE AFTER WHAT I
JUST SAW TODAY

04:23.346 --> 04:25.932
AT PRACTICE, BEVERLY
SHOULD BE THANKING
THEIR LUCKY STARS

04:25.932 --> 04:29.102
YOU'RE NOT AT
SOUTH CRENSHAW ANYMORE.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.825
COACH BAKER.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.619
CLIFF. MY MAN.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.828
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.830
OOH. SPENCER JAMES.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.624
WHOO! HE'S BETTER
THAN ADVERTISED.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.293
I HATE THAT I WAS AWAY
ON BUSINESS MOST OF
THE SEASON.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.671
WATCHING A STREAMED
FEED OF THE GAME DOES
HIS TALENT NO JUSTICE.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.465
YEAH. EVERY DAY,
I'M AMAZED.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.676
SO, UH, HOW LONG
ARE YOU HERE FOR
THIS TIME?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.470
A WHILE. YOU KNOW,
IT GIVES ME A CHANCE

05:03.470 --> 05:05.639
TO GET MORE INVOLVED
IN OUR FOOTBALL PROGRAM.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.183
BILLY: OH, OK.
CLIFF: I'M STILL IN
THE SHADOWS, FOR THE MOST PART,

05:08.183 --> 05:11.186
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT I WAS SEEN

05:11.186 --> 05:13.939
AS SOMETHING MORE
THAN JUST A CHECKBOOK.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.024
BILLY: OK.
CLIFF: HEY, UH,

05:16.024 --> 05:17.943
YOU EXCITED
ABOUT 7-ON-7?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.819
YEAH, MAN, YEAH.
I AM.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.112
WE NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE WORK,

05:21.112 --> 05:22.822
BUT I THINK OUR BOYS
ARE GONNA BE OK.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.324
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
OFFENSE WILL BE FINE,
RUNNING ON ALL CYLINDERS

05:26.326 --> 05:27.994
AS SOON AS JORDAN
KNOCKS OFF THE RUST.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.080
SURE, YEAH, AND, UH,
AS SOON AS HE GETS

05:30.080 --> 05:31.873
THE EXTRA HELP HE
NEEDS FROM THOSE
OTHER RECEIVERS.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.334
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU GOT A FEW WEEKS
TILL THE NEXT GAME.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.002
BILLY: YES.
CLIFF: MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME

05:36.002 --> 05:38.338
TO GET THINGS CLEANED UP
WITH THOSE RECEIVERS.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.506
YUP.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.715
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.384
OK. GOOD TO
SEE YOU, MAN.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.677
CLIFF: ALL RIGHT, YOU, TOO.
BILLY: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.804
HA HA!
COACH BAKER!

05:51.184 --> 05:53.853
OLIVIA: WAIT,
JORDAN ENDED PRACTICE?

05:53.853 --> 05:57.732
YEP. THE VIBE BETWEEN HIM
AND YOUR POPS ON THAT FIELD
RIGHT NOW IS BANANAS.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.068
OBVIOUSLY, COACH BAKER
GOING EASY ON HIM
OUT OF GUILT.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.613
AND JORDAN'S TESTING
THE BOUNDARIES, SEEING HOW
MUCH HE CAN GET AWAY WITH.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.156
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.117
THE MORE HE ALLOWS JORDAN
TO QUESTION HIS AUTHORITY,

06:07.117 --> 06:08.910
THE MORE EVERYBODY ELSE
GONNA DO THE SAME.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.913
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
IT'S OVER. OUR TEAM IS
AS GOOD AS DONE.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.834
GREAT. YET ANOTHER REASON
PUSHING YOU TOWARDS CHOOSING
SOUTH CRENSHAW.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.795
I AIN'T EXACTLY
FEELIN' THEM, EITHER.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.131
OH, YEAH,
'CAUSE OF DARNELL.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.717
ARE YOU READY TO TALK
TO YOUR DAD YET?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
AND SAY WHAT?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.221
I'M SORRY. I JUST--

06:28.221 --> 06:30.390
I KNOW THE WHOLE
DARNELL THING SUCKS.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.560
LOOK, 7 YEARS RAISING
ANOTHER MAN'S CHILD IS
A LONG TIME.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.232
OLIVIA: WHAT IS IT?
SPENCER: IT'S CHRIS.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.735
HIS DOCTOR CLEARED HIM
TO RUN AGAIN.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.988
BARRING ANY SETBACKS,
HE SHOULD BE GOOD FOR THE
SEASON OPENER THIS FALL.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.991
I MEAN, THAT'S AMAZING.
GOOD FOR HIM.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.076
AND BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
HIM BREAKING UP WITH YOU

06:50.076 --> 06:52.412
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIS PROGRESS, A'IGHT?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.206
WAIT. BUT WITH DARNELL
ON THE TEAM, WILL CHRIS

06:55.206 --> 06:58.001
EVEN HAVE A QB1 SPOT
TO GO BACK TO?

06:58.001 --> 07:01.421
LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.923
DISTANT BOY: HEY, YO!

07:09.262 --> 07:12.182
GUESS WHO I JUST
EXCHANGED NUMBERS WITH.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.683

07:13.683 --> 07:15.268

07:15.268 --> 07:17.437

07:17.437 --> 07:19.147

07:19.147 --> 07:22.442
GOT THROUGH TO YOUR MOM,
SO...AT LEAST SHE'S TRYING.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.778
GOOD TO SEE ONE OF US

FOR DARNELL?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.754
HOW DO WE KNOW
IT AIN'T SOME OLD
CRAZY SITUATION?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.557
MY POPS HOME?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.392
NAH, HE STEPPED OUT
FOR A LITTLE,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.269
BUT YOU CAN WAIT
IN HERE IF YOU WANT.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.062
NO, I'M GOOD.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.148
YOU LEAVING?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.276
YEAH, WELL, LOOK, MAN,
THE ONLY REASON

17:48.276 --> 17:50.403
WHY I CAME OUT HERE WAS
TO PLAY BALL FOR COREY.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.614
THE LAST THING
I WANTED TO DO WAS
DRIVE Y'ALL APART.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.743
CATCHING THE BUS BACK
TO NEVADA TOMORROW.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.037
WHAT? YOU AIN'T GOT
NOTHING TO SAY?

18:00.037 --> 18:02.999
I MEAN, 'CAUSE THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

18:17.263 --> 18:20.599
HEY, YOU REMEMBER
THAT RECEIVER
FROM PORTER RANCH

18:20.599 --> 18:23.269
WHO SHREDDED US
FOR 3 TOUCHDOWNS
LAST SEASON?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.980
BILLY: UH, TONY WRIGHT?
CLIFF: YEAH.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.191
A.D. HART JUST
PUT IN A REQUEST
FOR HIS TRANSFER.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.694
HEY, HOLD UP.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.946
MY ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
PUT IN A REQUEST?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948
AT MY STRONG
SUGGESTION, YEAH.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.159
WRIGHT WILL BE HERE
ON MONDAY.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.411
AND NOBODY THOUGHT TO CHECK
WITH ME ABOUT THIS?

18:40.411 --> 18:42.455
WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE
ECSTATIC; YOU WERE
THE ONE THROWING

18:42.455 --> 18:45.541
EVERY RECEIVER NOT NAMED
SPENCER JAMES UNDER
THE BUS THE OTHER DAY.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.044
NO, THAT WAS ME
COMMENTING ON PRACTICE.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.046
LOOK, LOOK,
THIS IS MY TEAM.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.797
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
A LEAK IN THE SHIP,

18:51.797 --> 18:53.841
THEN I'MA BE THE ONE
TO PATCH IT UP.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.844
LOOK, HERE'S
THE HARD REALITY, BILLY.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.014
COACHES COME AND GO, OK?
THIS ISN'T YOUR TEAM.

19:00.014 --> 19:03.184
THIS IS BEVERLY'S TEAM,
WHICH EFFECTIVELY
MAKES IT MY TEAM,

19:03.184 --> 19:05.227
GIVEN MY POSITION
AS LEAD BOOSTER.

19:05.227 --> 19:09.148
NOW I WARNED YOU,
MORE THAN A CHECKBOOK,
REMEMBER?

19:09.148 --> 19:12.818
UH, DO YOU STAB
ALL YOUR FRIENDS IN
THE BACK LIKE THIS?

19:12.818 --> 19:15.821
BECAUSE YOU WERE ON
THE HIRING COMMITTEE.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.824
YOU PICKED ME
TO LEAD THIS TEAM,

19:18.824 --> 19:21.160
SO WHEN--WHEN DID I
LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.371
YOU HAVEN'T,
AND AS LONG
AS YOU'RE OK

19:23.371 --> 19:25.873
WITH THIS BUDDING
PARTNERSHIP,

19:25.873 --> 19:28.084
YOU'RE STILL
IN GOOD STANDING.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.919
MONDAY.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.964
CLIFF: IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY GOOD DAY
ON MONDAY.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.010
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED TO TALK.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.513
SPENCER: HEY, MY BAD, MAN.
JORDAN: YO, FOR WHAT?

19:40.513 --> 19:43.224
FOR TURNING YOUR
WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
WHEN I MOVED HERE.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.226
I DON'T THINK I
EVER REALLY
APOLOGIZED FOR THAT.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.561
WHAT? WHO CARES?
THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.772
I MEAN, YEAH,
WE HAD SOME DRAMA
IN THE BEGINNING,

19:49.772 --> 19:51.774
BUT WE FOUND
A WAY PAST IT.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.610
LOOK, YOU'RE--YOU'RE
FAMILY NOW, SPENCE.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.988
HOW EXACTLY DID YOU
GET PAST IT?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.490
DUDE, SERIOUSLY?
WHY YOU ALL UP IN

19:59.490 --> 20:01.367
YOUR FEELINGS RIGHT NOW?
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF--

20:01.367 --> 20:03.035
JORDAN.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.206
MY--MY BAD. OK. UM,

20:07.206 --> 20:10.209
LOOK, I GUESS
I JUST GOT TO KNOW YOU

20:10.209 --> 20:12.920
FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE,
YOU KNOW, AND EVENTUALLY

20:12.920 --> 20:15.923
IT CLICKED THAT MY BEEF
WAS NEVER REALLY WITH YOU.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.467
IT WAS ABOUT ME
AND MY DAD AND OUR ISSUES.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.303
WELL, PLUS--HEH!--
EVERY SINGLE TIME ASH AND I

20:21.303 --> 20:23.889
TRIED TO BLOW UP
YOUR SPOT AND GET YOU
SENT BACK TO CRENSHAW,

20:23.889 --> 20:25.891
IT JUST KEPT BITING US
IN THE ASS.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.518
YEAH. YEAH, Y'ALL
REALLY GOT ME DRUNK

20:27.518 --> 20:29.562
BEFORE I HAD
TO SHOW OFF
FOR THOSE BOOSTERS.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.397
WE DID, DIDN'T WE?
YEAH.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.773
Y'ALL CRAZY, MAN.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.984
FUN TIMES.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.571
HEY, WHAT--YOU OUT
OF HERE ALREADY?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.239
YEAH, MAN.
I'LL BE BACK.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.283
I GOT TO HANDLE
SOMETHING THAT AIN'T
SITTIN' RIGHT.

20:42.283 --> 20:46.245
OK. HEY, REAL QUICK,
DO YOU THINK I'M BEING
A DISTRACTION TO THE TEAM?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.538
100%,

20:47.538 --> 20:49.081
BUT I GET IT.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.624
YOU AND COACH STILL
WORKING THROUGH
YOUR ISSUES.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.543
NO DIFFERENT THAN ME
AND MY POPS.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.886
IT'S KIND OF CUTE
IN HERE. OK.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.554
WE'RE OFF TO A DECENT START.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.972
NICE.

21:08.142 --> 21:12.229
OK. I TAKE THAT BACK.
THEY ARE ALL DRESSED IN WHITE.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.858
WHAT IN "THE STEPFORD WIVES"
IS GOING ON?

21:15.858 --> 21:18.652
PLEASE GIVE ME A REASON
TO BACK OUT.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.865
I WILL SWING BY AND HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.283
NICE TRY.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.202
NOW'S NOT
REALLY A GOOD TIME.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.329
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
SOME ERRANDS TO RUN.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.955
WELL, IF YOU DON'T HEAR
FROM ME IN A FEW HOURS,

21:29.955 --> 21:31.832
SEND A SEARCH PARTY.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.466
WE JUST GO RIGHT
IN THERE.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.634
OH. SORRY.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.885
-HEY.
-OH.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.470
YOU OUT ALREADY?

21:44.470 --> 21:47.431
YEAH. WAIT. I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE SPENCER'S EX.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.767
I WOULD LOVE TO BE KNOWN
AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN THAT.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.894
I'M SORRY. UM, OLIVIA.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.729
WE MET AT
THE PARK CLEANUP.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.773
YEAH, I REMEMBER.
YOU GOING IN?

21:55.773 --> 22:01.111
UH, NOT ANYMORE.
KIND OF NOT DRESSED
FOR THE OCCASION.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.155
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR NOT READING
THE BROCHURE.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.075
NOT HAVING DRESSED
APPROPRIATELY THESE
WOMEN CAN FORGIVE.

22:06.075 --> 22:10.246
STANDING THEM UP?
NOT SO MUCH. COME ON.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

22:10.246 --> 22:14.458
FULL DISCLOSURE:
I'M ONLY DOING
THIS FOR MY MOM.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.503
I GET THE SENSE THAT
THIS IS HER WAY
OF PROVING

22:17.503 --> 22:19.964
SHE CAN RAISE ME
ANCHORED TO MY
BLACK CULTURE

22:19.964 --> 22:21.632
WITHOUT MY DAD AROUND.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.884
OK. MRS. BAKER.
I HEAR THAT.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.805
ME, ON THE OTHER HAND,
I HAD NO CHOICE.
I'M THIRD GENERATION.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.724
BOTH MY MOM AND GRANNY
WERE COTILLIONAIRES.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.101
OUR FAMILY'S BIG
ON TRADITION.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.186
THAT'S AWESOME.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.355
GOOD EVENING, COTILLIONAIRES.
WELCOME TO SOLA MUSE.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.108
JUST STOPPING BY TO GIVE YOU
YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE PACKETS.

22:39.108 --> 22:43.362
SO FEEL FREE TO FILL IT OUT
HERE OR WHEN YOU GET HOME.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.823
THANK YOU.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.743
THANKS.

22:49.743 --> 22:55.291
FIRST QUESTION UP,
WHO ARE YOU?

22:55.291 --> 22:57.710
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
I ANSWERED THIS

22:57.710 --> 22:59.712
SHORT ESSAY QUESTION
IN THIRD GRADE.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.382
HA HA! AND WHAT DO YOU SEE
AS YOUR CONTRIBUTION
TO THE WORLD?

23:03.382 --> 23:06.385
THAT'S EASY. PROGRESS
FOR OUR PEOPLE.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.444
-DARNELL JUST LEFT?
-YUP.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.280
INSISTED ON GETTING
HISSELF TO
THE BUS STATION.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.659
FOR THE RECORD, I
DIDN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN
EITHER OF YOU.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.330
IT WAS DARNELL'S DECISION
TO GO BACK HOME.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.664
WHY?

23:35.664 --> 23:38.500
SEEING THE STRAIN HIM
BEING HERE WAS CAUSING

23:38.500 --> 23:42.755
OUR RELATIONSHIP, HE
FELT HE SHOULD LEAVE.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.965
I COULDN'T TALK
HIM OUT OF IT.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.384
SO HE JUST BACK
WITH HIS MOM?

23:47.384 --> 23:48.927
YOU REALLY CARE?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.763
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

23:50.763 --> 23:56.101
HIS MOTHER, RENEE, SHE
DOING A TOUR OVERSEAS.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.938
GOOD WOMAN. MEANS WELL.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.523
BUT SHE JUST LOVES
BEING A SOLDIER

24:01.523 --> 24:03.651
MORE THAN SHE LOVES
BEING A MOTHER--

24:03.651 --> 24:05.861
HER WORDS.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.781
SO DARNELL GOES
BACK HOME

24:08.781 --> 24:11.075
TO HIS MOTHER'S
HOUSE ALONE.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.452
GETTING BY THE BEST
WAY HE KNOWS HOW.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.204
I'M SORRY, DAD.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.960
I WAS HURT,
AND I WAS ANGRY, AND...

24:21.960 --> 24:24.880
IT WAS JUST EASIER
TO BLAME DARNELL.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.590
I KNOW, SON.

24:41.105 --> 24:44.108
I HAD A FEELING YOU'D
COME HERE FIRST.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.903
I DID THE SAME THING
THE NIGHT BEFORE

24:47.903 --> 24:49.279
I ENROLLED AT BEVERLY.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.864
AT LEAST YOU GOT
A CHANCE TO PLAY.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.783
I WAS JUST GETTING
WARMED UP.

24:52.783 --> 24:58.038
HEY, LOOK, BRO,
I WASN'T TRYING TO
MESS UP Y'ALL's LIFE.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.165
YOU GOT TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.919
YOUR POPS, MAN. HE
CHANGED THE GAME FOR ME.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.756
NOT HAVING A FATHER
AROUND FOR THE FIRST
9 YEARS OF MY LIFE

25:07.756 --> 25:09.258
FORCED ME TO GROW UP.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.385
IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET
COREY THAT I LEARNED

25:11.385 --> 25:13.303
HOW TO BE A SON FOR
THE FIRST TIME.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.264
HE GAVE ME SOMEONE
I COULD COUNT ON.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.142
KIND OF LIKE MY COACH AT
BEVERLY DID FOR ME.

25:18.142 --> 25:22.062
LOOK, MAN, YOUR HOME
IS CLEARLY WITH COREY,

25:22.062 --> 25:25.482
WHICH MAKES CRENSHAW
YOUR HOME NOW, TOO.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.568
YOU SHOULD STAY.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.320
HEH. NOW, YOU--
YOU SURE?

25:30.320 --> 25:34.116
MY BEEF AIN'T WITH YOU.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.892

32:31.616 --> 32:35.453
JUST KEEP IT MOVING,
PREACH.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.039
HEY, HIP HOP'S A DIRTY GAME.

32:38.039 --> 32:41.626
I SAW A LOT OF HOMIES
GET LOST IN THE SAUCE
CHASING THAT FAME.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.461
THERE WAS ONE HOMIE
IN PARTICULAR

32:43.461 --> 32:44.921
WHO HAD WHAT IT TOOK,

32:44.921 --> 32:47.424
BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR
HIM TO GET ON THAT STAGE

32:47.424 --> 32:50.802
AND PERFORM FOR
THE FIRST TIME, HE FROZE.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.306
I SAW THAT SAME LOOK
ON YOUR FACE TONIGHT

32:54.306 --> 32:56.016
WHEN HOMEBOY WENT IN ON YOU.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.476
SO WHAT YOU TRYING
TO SAY?

32:58.476 --> 33:00.312
MAYBE THIS MUSIC THING
AIN'T FOR YOU.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.814
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, PREACH,
WHY YOU EVEN CARE?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.566
I THOUGHT WE
WASN'T FAMILY NO MORE.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.026
WE AIN'T.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.528
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MAYBE
NEEDED A LITTLE GAME.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.863
BY TELLING ME TO QUIT?

33:09.863 --> 33:11.698
BY TELLING YOU TO KEEP
YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.326
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT
LIKE ME, COOP.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.869
YOU GOT SOME HUSTLE
IN YOUR BLOOD.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.495
JUST SEE WHAT ELSE
IS OUT THERE.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.664
READY TO BOUNCE?

33:23.668 --> 33:25.128
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU RIGHT.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.464
I DO GOT A LOT OF
HUSTLE IN MY BLOOD,

33:27.464 --> 33:29.507
AND I AIN'T NEVER
GONNA GIVE UP
ON MY DREAM.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.718
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE
THAN TONIGHT
TO BREAK ME.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.930
AND YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.894
SPENCER: HEY.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.812
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.
I HAVE MIDTERMS
NEXT WEEK.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.564
WOULD YOU MIND BEING
MY STUDY BUDDY
AGAIN TONIGHT?

33:44.564 --> 33:46.650
YOU KNOW I GOT YOU, MOM.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.945
HERE YOU GO.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.951
UH, YEAH. THIS--THIS IS
LIKE JAPANESE TO ME.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.536
YOU SURE YOU
WOULDN'T BE BETTER
OFF WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

33:58.536 --> 34:01.331
LIKE--I DON'T KNOW--
MICAH?

34:01.331 --> 34:04.542
MM-HMM. NOT SUBTLE.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.127
I JUST AIN'T SEEN HIM
IN A MINUTE.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.379
WHY'D HE DISAPPEAR?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.880
OH, THINGS GOT COMPLICATED

34:08.880 --> 34:10.590
THE MINUTE HURRICANE
COREY BLEW INTO TOWN.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.550
SO YOU AND MICAH
BROKE UP.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.762
NOT FOR SURE WE WERE
EVER AT THAT POINT.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.681
LOOK, I KNOW
WHEN DAD LEFT,

34:17.681 --> 34:19.933
YOU MADE A CHOICE TO PUT
ME AND DILLON FIRST,
AND WE LOVE YOU FOR THAT.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.060
BUT IT'S TIME TO PUT
YOURSELF FIRST FOR A CHANGE.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.770
I'VE DONE IT.
DILLON'S DONE IT.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.730
EVEN DAD HAS DONE IT.
IT'S YOUR TURN, MA.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.488
HEY, MAN.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.739
HEY, WHAT'S UP, COACH?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.658
MY BAD FOR SHOWING UP
UNANNOUNCED.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.660
YOU GOT A FEW SECONDS?

34:38.660 --> 34:40.078
YEAH.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.204
HEY, GRACIE.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.914
HEY, BILLY.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.543
UH, LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO PUT ANY MORE PRESSURE,

34:46.543 --> 34:48.461
PUT ANY MORE--

34:48.461 --> 34:50.463
YOU NEED TO KNOW
IF I'M TRANSFERRING
BACK TO SOUTH CRENSHAW.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.924
YEAH. I MEAN,
I'M JUST PUTTING
MY TEAM BACK TOGETHER.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.051
SO I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT PIECES I'M GONNA USE.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.887
LOOK, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU GOT BIGGER
PROBLEMS THAN ME, MAN.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.348
YOU CANNOT KEEP LETTING
JORDAN SLIDE.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.434
OH. RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S COMPLICATED.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.227
NOT REALLY.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.021
YOU WANT YOUR SON
BACK, SO YOU'RE
GOING EASY ON HIM.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.731
I GET IT, BUT I KNOW
FOR A FACT

35:07.731 --> 35:09.607
THAT JORDAN MISSES
HIS COACH,

35:09.607 --> 35:12.110
THE TOUGH, DEMANDING
COACH THAT PUSHED HIM TO
BECOME A STATE CHAMPION.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.487
HE NEEDS THAT GUY
ON THE FIELD.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.699
ONCE YOU GET THAT BACK,
YOU CAN FOCUS ON BECOMING
FATHER AND SON AGAIN

35:17.699 --> 35:20.285
BUT OFF THE FIELD,
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.662
OK. BUT I, UH--

35:22.662 --> 35:24.497
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.750
HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.422
ACTUALLY, I HAVE.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.799
OK.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.638
GOOD MORNING,
SWEETIE.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.599
HOW WAS THE SOCIAL?

35:42.599 --> 35:44.893
AND, LISTEN,
IF YOU HATE IT,

35:44.893 --> 35:46.561
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.397
I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU TRYING.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.316
NO. ACTUALLY, IT
WASN'T THAT BAD.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.859
OH!

35:52.859 --> 35:56.196
IT ACTUALLY MADE ME
REALIZE SOMETHING.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.989
WHAT?

35:57.989 --> 36:01.451
THE OTHER DAY I WAS
ASKED A VERY SIMPLE
QUESTION:

36:01.451 --> 36:03.161
WHO AM I,

36:03.161 --> 36:07.665
AND WHAT HAS BEEN
MY CONTRIBUTION
TO THE WORLD?

36:07.665 --> 36:09.167
AND I REALIZED
I HAD NO CLUE.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.835
MY WHOLE LIFE
HAS BEEN DEFINED

36:10.835 --> 36:12.170
BY BEING TETHERED

36:12.170 --> 36:15.423
TO SOMETHING
OR SOMEONE ELSE--

36:15.423 --> 36:17.342
ADDICTION,

36:17.342 --> 36:21.012
BEING EX-NFL STAR
BILLY BAKER'S DAUGHTER,

36:21.012 --> 36:22.472
BEING ONE-HALF OF
A TWIN.

36:22.472 --> 36:27.185
WELL, SWEETIE, THAT'S
NOT ALL THAT DEFINES YOU.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.895
IT FEELS THAT WAY.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.772
I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH
TIME CONSUMED

36:30.772 --> 36:32.857
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
IDENTITIES THAT I'VE

36:32.857 --> 36:35.527
NEVER TAKEN THE TIME
TO CARVE OUT MY OWN.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.863
WELL, THEN START TODAY.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.241
FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE

36:41.241 --> 36:44.702
AND JUST KNOW THAT
WHATEVER YOU DISCOVER,

36:44.702 --> 36:48.206
I WILL BE EQUALLY AS
PROUD OF THAT OLIVIA

36:48.206 --> 36:54.212
AS I AM OF THE ONE
SITTING IN FRONT
OF ME RIGHT NOW.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.925
HEY. JUST IN TIME
FOR BREAKFAST.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.260
LET ME FIX YOU A PLATE.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.886
NAH, I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.558
I CAN'T EAT RIGHT NOW.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.059
YOU OK?

37:08.059 --> 37:10.812
UH, I'VE FINALLY DECIDED

37:10.812 --> 37:12.772
WHERE I'M GONNA PLAY
THIS FALL.

37:14.274 --> 37:20.405
I'M CHOOSING YOU TO BE
MY FATHER, NOT MY COACH.

37:20.405 --> 37:24.909
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.413
I--I JUST WANT TO BE
YOUR SON.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.207
AND I DON'T WANT FOOTBALL
GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.501
SO I'M GONNA STAY
AT BEVERLY.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.796
LOOK, I SEEN
WHAT THIS HAS DONE

37:36.796 --> 37:39.090
TO COACH BAKER AND JORDAN,
AND I DON'T WANT--

37:57.358 --> 37:58.818
YOU NEEDED TO SEE ME?

37:58.818 --> 38:02.781
YEAH. I, UH, I JUST
BLOCKED TONY WRIGHT

38:02.781 --> 38:04.282
FROM COMING TO BEVERLY.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.534
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE
YOU A HEADS-UP

38:06.534 --> 38:08.453
FACE TO FACE.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.623
YOU KNOW, ABOVE BOARD,
PROFESSIONAL WAY
OF HANDLING THINGS.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.958
WELL, 5-STAR RECEIVERS ARE
IN ABUNDANCE AROUND HERE.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.794
I'LL JUST SHAKE A TREE
AND FIND ANOTHER ONE.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.754
-OK, I'LL BLOCK THEM, TOO.
-OH.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.715
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU
MAY BELIEVE, THIS IS
STILL MY TEAM, CLIFF.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.342
AND LAST TIME THAT
I CHECKED,

38:22.342 --> 38:25.053
I GOT US ALL A STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.180
SPENCER JAMES LED THEM
TO A CHAMPIONSHIP.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.766
WHO DO YOU THINK
BROUGHT HIM HERE?

38:29.766 --> 38:32.143
ME. I DID THAT.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.687
BUT AT THE END OF
THE DAY,

38:34.687 --> 38:37.565
YOUR FELLOW BOOSTERS,
ALL OF WHOM HAVE VOICED
THEIR SUPPORT IN ME,

38:37.565 --> 38:40.527
THEY KNOW WHAT IT
TAKES TO RUN THIS TEAM,

38:40.527 --> 38:43.154
AND IT AIN'T
A CHECKBOOK.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.907
SO YOU CAN SEE
YOUR WAY OUT.

38:49.911 --> 38:55.250
FOR THE RECORD, BILLY,
YOU WERE NEVER MY CHOICE
TO BE HEAD COACH.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.550
SINGER: ♪ WEST SIDE,
GET MONEY, MAKE MONEY ♪

39:03.550 --> 39:04.926
♪ MAKE MONEY... ♪

39:04.926 --> 39:07.512
YO, I'VE BEEN
THINKING.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.014
DON'T YOU SEE ME EATING?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.350
LISTEN, YOU NEED LEGIT
SOURCES FOR MONEY,

39:12.350 --> 39:14.352
AND I COULD REALLY
USE SOME HELP.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.271
SO I'M THINKING MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST WORK
TOGETHER.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.398
-DOING WHAT?
-SELLING MY MUSIC.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.024
I WANT TO DO IT
INDIE-STYLE.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.234
YOU KNOW, MIXTAPES,

39:21.234 --> 39:23.069
JUST LIKE
NEIGHBORHOOD NIP DID IT.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.029
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.532
MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU
DAMN SURE KNOW HOW
TO MOVE SOME PRODUCT,

39:27.532 --> 39:30.368
ONE THAT AIN'T GONNA
LAND YOUR ASS BACK
IN JAIL EITHER.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.704
WHERE'S YOUR MUSIC?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.913
I'M WORKING ON IT.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.707
SHOOT IT TO ME WHEN
YOU'RE READY.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.376
IF I LIKE WHAT I HEAR, THEN
MAYBE I'LL ROCK WITH YOU.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.211
OK.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.214
BILLY: ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
GATHER ROUND REAL QUICK.

39:43.214 --> 39:48.177
I'VE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.
RARE OCCURRENCE. YES, I KNOW.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.972
BUT I'VE MADE A DECISION ON WHO
I WANT TO LEAD AS CAPTAINS

39:50.972 --> 39:53.558
FOR THIS
SPRING'S 7-ON-7 LEAGUE,

39:53.558 --> 39:57.186
SPENCER AND ASHER.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.855
I'LL GO OVER WITH YOU TWO
WHAT I EXPECT

39:58.855 --> 40:00.607
FROM THE FIELD OF 30.

40:00.607 --> 40:04.027
YOU'RE EXCUSED.
CONGRATULATIONS, BOYS.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.740
WELL DONE.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.577
JORDAN, CAN I TALK WITH
YOU FOR A SECOND?

40:12.577 --> 40:14.912
YEAH.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.374
SO, LOOK, I HOPE YOU KNOW

40:18.374 --> 40:21.169
THAT I WENT IN A DIFFERENT
DIRECTION BECAUSE--

40:21.169 --> 40:22.754
YOU DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN, ALL RIGHT?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.506
I HAVEN'T BEEN ACTING
VERY CAPTAIN-LIKE LATELY.

40:25.506 --> 40:26.883
SO I GET IT.

40:26.883 --> 40:30.053
JUST KNOW I'M GONNA
EARN IT BACK.

40:36.059 --> 40:40.980
SO I WANTED YOU TO HEAR
THIS FROM ME FIRST.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.982
I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.192
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME
AT BEVERLY

40:44.192 --> 40:45.985
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.029
NICE.

40:48.029 --> 40:52.617
"NICE." YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TURN YOUR EXCITEMENT
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

40:52.617 --> 40:56.454
I MEAN, YEAH, I'M
THRILLED YOU'RE STAYING,

40:56.454 --> 41:00.124
BUT I HONESTLY WOULD'VE
BEEN THRILLED EITHER WAY.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.127
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.630
THERE SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

41:05.630 --> 41:07.674
NOT REALLY.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.218
OK. LAYLA,
THINGS HAVE BEEN

41:10.218 --> 41:13.012
KIND OF DIFFERENT
WITH YOU LATELY.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.806
AND, MY BAD, I'VE BEEN
CAUGHT UP WITH MY OWN STUFF,

41:14.806 --> 41:16.599
BUT I'M FOCUSED NOW.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.810
YOU KNOW, I'M
TRYING TO HELP YOU.
JUST TALK TO ME.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.771
I DON'T OWE YOU EVERY
THOUGHT IN MY HEAD,
SPENCER.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.065
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DO, BUT
I'M CONCERNED, THAT'S ALL.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.400
OK, I'M FINE.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.444
I JUST--LOOK,
I NEED TO GO.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.905
I WANT TO BE ALONE
TONIGHT, OK? GOOD NIGHT.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.156
LAYLA--

41:32.156 --> 41:33.574
DAMN IT, SPENCER.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.202
JUST GET OUT OF
MY CAR, PLEASE.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.413
GET OUT. I'M SERIOUS.
