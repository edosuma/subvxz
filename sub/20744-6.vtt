- What's the name of the act?

11:00.760 --> 11:03.596
- We are Just Us.
- "Just Us." Just you guys.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.098
- Just Us.
- What are you gonna do?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.900
- We're gonna sing.
- We're gonna sing.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.971
- We like to take people
on a rollercoaster ride

11:07.971 --> 11:09.068
- We like to take people
on a rollercoaster ride

11:09.068 --> 11:10.603
when we do our shows.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.071
Make them laugh.
Make them cry.

11:12.071 --> 11:16.142
Make them giggle, and basically
just touch their hearts.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.178
- I've been watching "AGT"
for the past ten years,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.113
and I've never seen anything
like us on stage.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.915
- Just Us, go get them.

11:37.971 --> 11:39.232
- Okay, and what is Just Us?

11:39.232 --> 11:42.101
- We are a jazzy swinging
vocal quartet

11:42.101 --> 11:43.736
from the Antelope Valley.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.538
- Okay.
Tell me what the big dream is.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.473
- To win this and get to Vegas,

11:47.473 --> 11:50.343
and we think we're
a consummate Vegas act.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.578
- Oh, wow.
- You've got ambition.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.812
I like that.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.914

so we'll just go straight
for a vote--Howie?

12:25.111 --> 12:26.879

12:26.879 --> 12:28.281

12:28.281 --> 12:30.583

- We should practice.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.599

12:46.599 --> 12:48.334
- What's paying the bills
right now, guys?

12:48.334 --> 12:50.603
- I'm a student, so loans.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.473
- Loans?
- I'm a consultant.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.309
- Yeah, I'm really scared,
especially for Simon.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.312
The biggest judge I performed
in front of is my mom, I guess.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.414

You don't have to use that yet.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.815

13:02.815 --> 13:03.983

- Yeah.

13:03.983 --> 13:04.984

13:04.984 --> 13:06.352

- And we're Ilan and Josh.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.866
- They're cute.
- And how did you two meet?

13:19.866 --> 13:21.501
- We were both in Israel
at the same time,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.770
and we met at the Western Wall

13:23.770 --> 13:26.039
which is the holiest place
in the Jewish tradition.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.440
- So how long ago was that?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.941
- That was, like,
three years ago.

quite like you guys.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.229
It was cute.
- "Cute"?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.998
How can you call
beatboxing "cute?"

14:58.998 --> 15:01.968

15:03.436 --> 15:05.004
- Okay. Heidi?

15:05.004 --> 15:07.240
- I mean, it sounded
so unique and different.

15:07.240 --> 15:07.971
I was very impressed.

15:07.971 --> 15:09.075

15:13.780 --> 15:16.082
both of you, up there.
You were giving it some.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.550

15:17.550 --> 15:18.584

15:30.196 --> 15:32.832

16:20.980 --> 16:23.182
- And I didn't feel
much personality.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.686
I was watching
sort of eight mad robots.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.624
- Every one has too much
of a personality.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.326
I feel like when you dance
as a group,

16:33.326 --> 16:35.328
you all have to be the same.

16:57.783 --> 16:57.890
For me, that wasn't
a good audition.

16:57.890 --> 17:00.520
For me, that wasn't
a good audition.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.655
I didn't buy into
the group, I'm afraid.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.258
- I thought it was amazing.
- Well, to be fair,

17:05.258 --> 17:09.161
we are seeing things
slightly different today, Heidi.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.835

17:27.890 --> 17:28.614
- We are--
The Outlaws.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.083
- We're five passionate dancers.
- We were just, like,

17:31.083 --> 17:33.119
friends who wanted to do it,

17:33.119 --> 17:36.122
but we weren't, like,
trained dancers.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.224
We kind of had to learn
everything on our own.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.193
- Five, six, se...
Five, six, seven, eight.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.329
- Make sure it's up, and--
- Yeah.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.363
I can only do it to music.
It's weird.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.498
- Yeah.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.667
We're just not
very experienced.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.806
- These are our Outlaw hats,

17:53.806 --> 17:56.108
and they can be a pain
to dance with sometimes,

17:56.108 --> 17:57.890
but it helps complete
the overall picture.

17:57.890 --> 17:59.312
but it helps complete
the overall picture.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.649
- I think people would--
would appreciate that.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.051
This is a really big deal
for us,

18:05.051 --> 18:07.520
so we would definitely like
to think that we could win this.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.655
- We'd definitely
like to do so.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.657
- All right, man,
well, go represent.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.166
- Hi, guys.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.634
What is the name of your group?

18:21.634 --> 18:25.871
- We are the Outlaws.
- Outlaws. Nice.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.306
And how did you all meet?

18:27.306 --> 18:27.890
- We're just good friends
before we started dancing,

18:27.890 --> 18:29.375
- We're just good friends
before we started dancing,

18:29.375 --> 18:31.877
and we just wanted to see
what we could do.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.079
- And what's the dream,

18:33.079 --> 18:34.947
and what's
the point of entering this show?

18:34.947 --> 18:37.450
- Our dream is to be
the first dance crew

18:37.450 --> 18:39.151
to win "America's Got Talent."

18:39.151 --> 18:41.454
- Ah, there you go.

18:43.422 --> 18:44.757
- And why do you think

18:44.757 --> 18:47.660
a dance crew
has not won this show before?

18:47.660 --> 18:51.530
- Well, I think that dance crews

18:51.530 --> 18:52.832
just kind of play it safe

18:52.832 --> 18:56.535
with their dancing,
but I think we have ideas

18:56.535 --> 18:57.890
to try to make it

18:57.890 --> 18:57.970
to try to make it

18:57.970 --> 18:59.238
a little bit
more than just dancing

18:59.238 --> 19:01.207
and just entertainment
in general.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.109
- Okay, Outlaws, good luck.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.510

20:49.048 --> 20:50.282
What did you think, Heidi?

20:50.282 --> 20:51.450
- I'm just--I'm just saying
to Simon,

20:51.450 --> 20:53.018
"Why do I not feel
the same way?"

20:53.018 --> 20:55.955
I want to be jumping out
of my seat and screaming too,

20:55.955 --> 20:57.890
and I'm not.

20:57.890 --> 20:57.990
and I'm not.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.263
I'm just not.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.466
- I think that it was really
strong and very unique,

21:07.466 --> 21:08.734
and I also like the look.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.371
It's kind of like
an Amish hip-hop dance crew.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.144
- You see, I'm kind
of really split down the middle.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.678
I have to be honest.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.148
Half of me--

21:22.148 --> 21:23.849
hold on a second.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.890
Half of me absolutely loved you
and the originality.

21:27.890 --> 21:28.587
Half of me absolutely loved you
and the originality.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.590
But then I have to say,
the other half of me

21:31.590 --> 21:33.359
got not a little bit bored,

21:33.359 --> 21:35.060
but I was like--'cause
there's only so much popping

21:35.060 --> 21:36.862
and locking that you can do.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.231
Change it up.
Change the style up.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.500
- Let me tell you why I
liked you:

21:41.500 --> 21:43.836
because I've seen
a lot of dance groups

21:43.836 --> 21:46.005
on these shows every year.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.606
The ones that have done well,

21:47.606 --> 21:51.043
they tell a story, add humor,

21:51.043 --> 21:55.181
and most importantly show
individual personality,

21:55.181 --> 21:57.890
and it was like,
"Why shouldn't you be in dance

21:57.890 --> 21:58.350
and it was like,
"Why shouldn't you be in dance

21:58.350 --> 22:00.386
"what you are in music
when you're in a group,

22:00.386 --> 22:02.188
five different personalities?"

22:02.188 --> 22:04.190
I loved it.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.430
I think we should vote. Howie?

22:11.430 --> 22:15.301
- Oh, yeah, I liked it.
That's a yes.

22:17.069 --> 22:21.006
- I'm gonna say yes.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.341
Heidi?

22:22.341 --> 22:26.111
- I was not blown away,

that was beautiful.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.568
I was a little worried
in the beginning

28:56.568 --> 28:58.270
because you seemed
a little stiff

28:58.270 --> 28:59.471
and a little nervous.
Sorry.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.639
- A little.
- A little, right?

29:00.639 --> 29:01.773
- A little.
- Just a tad.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.175
- A little.
- But then, wow,

29:03.175 --> 29:06.211
when you started singing,
you felt right at home.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.747
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- It was beautiful.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.319

a really good voice.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.356
But you know what?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.758
I found you a little bit stiff.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.294
You know, when you sing,
let loose a little bit.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.597
I feel like you've kind of
put yourself in a bit of a box.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.532

29:48.186 --> 29:51.156

29:51.156 --> 29:52.824

29:55.694 --> 29:58.063

if you don't mind me asking?

29:58.063 --> 29:59.631

29:59.631 --> 30:00.632

Daniel, is we love your voice.

30:08.951 --> 30:10.342
It's all a little bit

30:10.342 --> 30:13.845
My advice is if you make it
forward to the next round,

30:13.845 --> 30:17.382
is that you've now got to get
outside your comfort zone.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.017
But having said that,

30:19.017 --> 30:21.987
your voice

33:11.389 --> 33:13.325
These days I have

33:13.325 --> 33:14.693

a lot of my time,

33:14.693 --> 33:16.528

a little bit better than that.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.518
- So who are you?
- My name's Jon Bernhardt.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.187
- Nice to meet you, Jon.
What do you do for a living?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.289
- My day job is as an actuary.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.291
- Like an accountant?
- We're the folks

33:46.291 --> 33:49.995
who didn't have the personality
to be an accountant.

33:49.995 --> 33:53.098
- So while you're working,

33:53.098 --> 33:54.733
what's really going on
in your head is

33:54.733 --> 33:57.369
is that "I want to be
doing this full-time," yeah?

33:57.369 --> 33:58.987
- It would be
a great dream, yeah.

33:58.987 --> 33:59.170
- It would be
a great dream, yeah.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.772
- All right, best of luck.
I hope it goes well.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.308
- Thank you.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.452
- Cool sound.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.204
- That is horrible.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.281
- ♪ Should I stay,
or should I go ♪

34:59.264 --> 35:00.599
- Wow.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.482
- Whoo!

35:21.419 --> 35:22.687
- Wow.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.122
Well, I've just got to say,

35:24.122 --> 35:26.858
there's something
fantastically nuts

35:26.858 --> 35:28.393
and weird about you, Jon.

35:28.393 --> 35:28.987
- That's what I'm going for.
- And when you went crazy

35:28.987 --> 35:31.296
- That's what I'm going for.
- And when you went crazy

35:31.296 --> 35:32.530
in the middle,

35:32.530 --> 35:34.399
it was like--you know,

35:34.399 --> 35:36.668
you stand up for every nerd

35:36.668 --> 35:38.536
who's ever wanted to be
a rock star.

35:38.536 --> 35:41.239
- Wow.
- Nerds rule!

35:41.239 --> 35:44.275
- I love that. Howie?

35:44.275 --> 35:46.144
- Just the joy in your face

35:46.144 --> 35:48.947
while you're playing
is so magnetic

35:48.947 --> 35:52.584
that I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.786
- Heidi?
- I love that song,

35:54.786 --> 35:57.522
and you butchered it to death.

35:57.522 --> 35:58.987
- Heidi!
- You don't understand.

35:58.987 --> 36:00.091
- Heidi!
- You don't understand.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.994
- I don't.

36:02.994 --> 36:07.265
- Okay, so when you first
started, it was awful.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.501
But then something changed--

36:09.501 --> 36:11.169
- Right.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.606
- And it was almost like you
had an invisible person there,

36:14.606 --> 36:16.441
and you were just
strangling them

36:16.441 --> 36:18.309
just like...

36:18.309 --> 36:19.844
And I thought,

36:19.844 --> 36:21.579
"I've never seen this before."

36:21.579 --> 36:23.048
I wanted to take back my "X."

36:23.048 --> 36:26.017
- Well, thank you.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.987
- We can take it back.

36:28.987 --> 36:29.554
- We can take it back.

36:29.554 --> 36:32.090
This is an important decision
we've got to make now.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.658
Let me start with Howie.

36:33.658 --> 36:36.561
- I'll say it with the same
kind of electrical magnetism

36:36.561 --> 36:38.229
that you gave us.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.565
Yes.

36:40.565 --> 36:43.835
- Thank you.
- Heidi?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.503
- Sorry, I'm gonna give you
a no.

36:45.503 --> 36:48.106
I didn't like it.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.242
- Heidi doesn't get it.

36:51.242 --> 36:54.879
- Mel?
- I'm gonna give you a yes.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.748
- Thanks.

36:56.748 --> 36:57.949
- Look, part of me thought

36:57.949 --> 36:58.987
it was one of the worst things

36:58.987 --> 36:59.317
it was one of the worst things

36:59.317 --> 37:01.119
I've ever seen
and heard in my life,

37:01.119 --> 37:03.655
and the other half of me
was so desperate

37:03.655 --> 37:07.025
to see what you
would do next, so...

37:12.263 --> 37:14.165
Okay, okay, okay.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.737
That's three yeses.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.607
- I'm stunned.
Thank you very much.

37:23.808 --> 37:26.411
- My man, Jon.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.987
You got to teach me
how to do this.

37:28.987 --> 37:29.414
You got to teach me
how to do this.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.159
- Do the dance!
Show me!

37:49.601 --> 37:52.504
Yeah! Keep it going for Jon,
y'all!

37:55.507 --> 37:58.987
Come on over here,
you rock star.

37:58.987 --> 37:59.277
Come on over here,
you rock star.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.380
This guy's a rock star
if I've ever seen one.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.449
- If someone had said,
"Well, describe today,"

38:04.449 --> 38:06.985
where do you start?

38:06.985 --> 38:08.887
- Rock on.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.822
- Thank you.
- You kicked actuary.

38:10.822 --> 38:15.260
- ♪ Should I stay
or should I go ♪

38:15.260 --> 38:19.063
- That looks amazing.
- I find you fascinating.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.633
- Oh, yeah.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.803
- This is the real thing,
500,000 volts.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.604
Hold still, Howie.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.987
- I don't want to do this.
- Ah!

38:28.987 --> 38:30.642
- I don't want to do this.
- Ah!

38:37.348 --> 38:39.517
- All right, guys, listen up.
We've worked hard,

38:39.517 --> 38:42.453
and it's now finally come,
so are you all ready?

38:42.453 --> 38:44.322
- Yes.
- Are you really ready?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.992
- Yes!
- It's our time.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.761
- Keep low on this.
Stay on center.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.830
- Stay on center.
Try to go together.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.498
- So we need to find
the timing of that.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.966
- I'm so proud of you guys,

38:54.966 --> 38:58.803
and just keep it tight,
keep it clean, but have fun.

38:58.803 --> 38:59.904
- I'm so excited for you.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.373
You guys are gonna
kill it out there.

39:02.373 --> 39:03.945
I love you so much, okay?

39:03.945 --> 39:03.975
I love you so much, okay?

39:03.975 --> 39:06.144
- I'm Ariel.
- I'm Derrick.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.879
- And we're part of Sila Sveta.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.181
- Sila Sveta?
- Yeah, it's Russian name.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.016
- Oh, what does
"Sila Sveta" mean?

39:12.016 --> 39:14.586
- "Power of light."
- I'm Alex.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.422
I am the creative director
of Sila Sveta.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.890
Growing up in Russia,

39:18.890 --> 39:21.860
I loved graffiti to bring colors

39:21.860 --> 39:25.196
to neighborhoods,
to gray buildings,

39:25.196 --> 39:27.799
and then I discovered
slide projectors.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.635
I am from Russia actually.
That couple is from America.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.270
- Oh, you guys are from here?
- Yes.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.945
- How'd you guys get together?
- Oh, it's Internet, you know?

39:33.945 --> 39:34.973
- How'd you guys get together?
- Oh, it's Internet, you know?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.507
- Alex really is a genius.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.910
He's ridiculously creative.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.479
We absolutely enjoy working
with him.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.348
- Let's make some fun.
- Let's do it.

39:43.348 --> 39:45.550
- Let's do it.
- Ah!

39:45.550 --> 39:48.219
- I have a wild imagination
inside of me,

39:48.219 --> 39:49.888
so I want to share,

39:49.888 --> 39:51.756
not everything,

39:51.756 --> 39:53.858
but the best part.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.668
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:03.668 --> 40:03.945
- Welcome, and you are?
- Sila Sveta.

40:03.945 --> 40:07.238
- Welcome, and you are?
- Sila Sveta.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.740
- In Russian, that means
"power of light."

40:08.740 --> 40:09.741
- Yeah?
- Yes.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.209
- I thought so. Okay.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.911
Now, tell me about
what we're gonna see.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.679
Did you guys create this?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.648
- Yeah, so it's
classical fairytale

40:16.648 --> 40:18.283
called "Sleeping Beauty,"

40:18.283 --> 40:22.820
and we upgraded to a modern way
with digital stuff.

40:22.820 --> 40:26.724
- Okay, and when did you come up
with this idea and this concept?

40:26.724 --> 40:29.260
- When I fixing my chandelier

40:29.260 --> 40:30.929
and I was standing on the top,

40:30.929 --> 40:33.945
I saw my daughter on the carpet,
and I saw that--

40:33.945 --> 40:34.365
I saw my daughter on the carpet,
and I saw that--

40:34.365 --> 40:36.834
"Wow. It's so amazing."

40:36.834 --> 40:38.536
- Okay, well, best of luck.

40:38.536 --> 40:39.637
Thank you.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.339
- Bye.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.704
- Very good.

42:53.704 --> 42:56.374
Thank you very much, guys.

42:56.374 --> 42:58.676
Okay, uh, Mel?

42:58.676 --> 43:02.680
- I have to say, visually,
that was absolutely stunning

43:02.680 --> 43:03.945
and so magical.

43:03.945 --> 43:05.249
and so magical.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.684
It really was.
I loved it.

43:06.684 --> 43:08.152
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

43:08.152 --> 43:10.822
- Howie, standing ovation?
- It was.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.390
Yeah, I couldn't
stand up high enough

43:12.390 --> 43:15.359
to tell you
how wonderful I think that was.

43:15.359 --> 43:18.863
- Thank you.
- This is truly the best year,

43:18.863 --> 43:22.600
and I'm witnessing the best acts
I have ever witnessed.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.904
One of the main reasons
I say that is exactly

43:26.904 --> 43:28.940
what I just watched
right now coming from you.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.241
- Thank you.

43:30.241 --> 43:31.976
- It was beautiful to watch

43:31.976 --> 43:33.144
the two of you.

43:33.144 --> 43:33.945
Really, really cool,
very modern, very new.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.246
Really, really cool,
very modern, very new.

43:35.246 --> 43:37.281
I've never seen anything
like this before.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.483
It was incredible.

43:38.483 --> 43:39.817
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.452
- Thank you.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.554
- I thought visually
it was fantastic,

43:43.554 --> 43:45.990
and the exciting thing
is it means in the future,

43:45.990 --> 43:49.127
we can sort of go anywhere
we want in any place, can't we?

43:49.127 --> 43:51.195
- Of course.
- Love that idea.

43:51.195 --> 43:53.131
Okay, we're gonna vote. Howie?

43:53.131 --> 43:55.233
- As you said, we can go
any place we want,

43:55.233 --> 43:56.701
so I'd love
to see you come back.

43:56.701 --> 43:58.402
It's a yes.
- Yes.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.471
Yeah. Thank you.
- Mel?

44:00.471 --> 44:02.907
- I have to say yes.
I loved it.

44:02.907 --> 44:03.945
- Definite yes from me.
- Yes!

44:03.945 --> 44:05.243
- Definite yes from me.
- Yes!

44:05.243 --> 44:07.845
- Thank you.
- You have four yeses.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.614
Congratulations.

44:09.614 --> 44:11.015
Thank you.

44:11.015 --> 44:15.386

- Amazing. Relief!

44:27.365 --> 44:30.434
- We did it. We did it.
- Yo, what's up, guys?

44:30.434 --> 44:31.769
It's Nick Cannon here

44:31.769 --> 44:33.437
just hanging backstage
at "America's Got Talent."

44:33.437 --> 44:33.945
Let's chat with some
of the contestants.

44:33.945 --> 44:34.972
Let's chat with some
of the contestants.

44:34.972 --> 44:36.040
Let's do this.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.308
- We're gonna teach you
how to juggle.

44:37.308 --> 44:38.743
All right,
so you're gonna have--whoop.

44:38.743 --> 44:40.244
- Oh, you're a great juggler.
- That's a good start..

44:40.244 --> 44:43.481
- You. Me. You. Me.
- You're juggling.

44:43.481 --> 44:45.483
- You want to juggle with Trish?
- Whoa.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.518
I wish I could grow
my mustache like that.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.086
What do you do
to get it like that?

44:49.086 --> 44:53.057
- You got to get the wax.
- Now, that's talent.

44:58.262 --> 44:59.363
Ahh!

44:59.363 --> 45:01.532
I ain't did that in 25 years.

45:04.602 --> 45:06.370
I think I could do that.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.806
Nah, it's not gonna happen.

45:08.806 --> 45:10.575
She dropped the phone.
She dropped his phone!

45:16.180 --> 45:18.950
- If someone's here today,
it's because they love

45:18.950 --> 45:22.720
what they do enough
to take it to the next level.

45:22.720 --> 45:27.058
- This is my dream
for all my life.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.125
- I still have a dream.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.560
- Yeah.
- Okay?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.629
My dream never stop.

45:31.629 --> 45:32.730
- Hello.
- Hi.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.465
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

45:34.465 --> 45:35.866
- I'm well. My name is Nick.
What's your name?

45:35.866 --> 45:37.735
- I'm Moya Angela.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.805
Since I was a little girl,
I've always loved to sing.

45:40.805 --> 45:43.010
I was in the youth choir
at my church.

45:43.010 --> 45:43.441
I was in the youth choir
at my church.

45:43.441 --> 45:46.277
I would say I was about five
or six years old,

45:46.277 --> 45:47.712
and they asked me to sing

45:47.712 --> 45:49.647
"The Greatest Love of All,"
Whitney Houston.

45:49.647 --> 45:52.750
I was so nervous, but I sang it.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.486
That was the most
amazing experience

45:55.486 --> 45:57.488
I ever had in my life.

45:57.488 --> 46:00.324
- ♪ Got to let it out ♪

46:00.324 --> 46:02.560
- I think the toughest part
about following this dream

46:02.560 --> 46:06.230
is to continue
to believe in yourself.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.967
I very often have self-doubt,

46:09.967 --> 46:13.010
or "Am I good enough?
Is my voice good enough?"

46:13.010 --> 46:14.372
or "Am I good enough?
Is my voice good enough?"

46:14.372 --> 46:16.407
Right now, I live in Las Vegas,

46:16.407 --> 46:20.311
and I'm a teacher to very
underprivileged students,

46:20.311 --> 46:22.580
actually,
and I absolutely love it,

46:22.580 --> 46:25.349
but I'm now at the point
in my life

46:25.349 --> 46:26.684
where I want to be me,

46:26.684 --> 46:29.620
and that's why I'm here
at "AGT."

46:29.620 --> 46:31.689
I'm really nervous though.
- I know.

46:31.689 --> 46:33.324
I can feel you just shaking.

46:33.324 --> 46:36.727
- My family,
their support is ridiculous.

46:36.727 --> 46:39.096
I just want to make them proud.

46:39.096 --> 46:41.532
I really do. Yeah.

46:41.532 --> 46:43.010
- Go out there
and give it to 'em.

46:43.010 --> 46:43.134
- Go out there
and give it to 'em.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.302
- Right now? All right!
- Right now.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.570
It's your moment.
Have fun out there.

46:46.570 --> 46:50.041

47:00.985 --> 47:02.920

47:02.920 --> 47:05.056
- If you don't mind me asking,
Moya, how old are you?

47:05.056 --> 47:06.891
- I am 32 years old.

47:06.891 --> 47:09.126
- And do you have, like,
a normal job, Moya?

47:09.126 --> 47:12.263
- I do. I'm a teacher.
- Aw.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.010
- So why, now, at the age of 32,

47:13.010 --> 47:15.533
- So why, now, at the age of 32,

47:15.533 --> 47:18.235
have you decided you're gonna
come on a show like this?

47:18.235 --> 47:19.503
- It's time for me to stand

47:19.503 --> 47:21.472
on my own two feet
as Moya Angela

47:21.472 --> 47:23.207

Amen!

I can do that here.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.740
Yes!

49:41.512 --> 49:43.010
- Oh!

49:43.010 --> 49:43.180
- Oh!

49:49.820 --> 49:52.490
- Okay, Moya.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.325
Howie?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.393
- You seem like you were born
to be on that stage.

49:56.393 --> 49:57.862
You were born to be
in this moment.

49:57.862 --> 49:59.663
You were born to be
doing nothing

49:59.663 --> 50:01.599
but what you're doing right now,

50:01.599 --> 50:03.033
and I think that's what

50:03.033 --> 50:06.537
you're gonna be doing
from this day forward.

50:06.537 --> 50:07.805
- Mel?

50:07.805 --> 50:10.140
- That has to be
one of my favorite

50:10.140 --> 50:13.010
Celine Dion songs of all time,

50:13.010 --> 50:13.277
Celine Dion songs of all time,

50:13.277 --> 50:17.615
so I was praying that
you wasn't gonna crucify it.

50:17.615 --> 50:19.350
But you made it your own,

50:19.350 --> 50:22.753
and that was just
so special, my God.

50:22.753 --> 50:25.623
- Thank you so much.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.559
- You sold it, and I bought it.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.661
- Yay.
- I did.

50:30.661 --> 50:33.297
- Moya, that's what
we call a singer.

50:33.297 --> 50:35.666
- Whoo!
- Yay!

50:38.702 --> 50:41.839
- That final note, Moya,
you nailed it.

50:41.839 --> 50:43.010
- Thank you so much, Simon.

50:43.010 --> 50:44.074
- Thank you so much, Simon.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.277
- And you know what I love
about you, Moya,

50:46.277 --> 50:48.879
is that you took
your two minutes,

50:48.879 --> 50:50.581
and you made the most of it.

50:50.581 --> 50:52.449
You know, you really made
an impression,

50:52.449 --> 50:54.818
and I'm gonna remember this
for a long time to come.

50:54.818 --> 50:56.053
- Thank you so much, Simon.
- Love you.

50:56.053 --> 50:59.123
- Thank you.

50:59.123 --> 51:00.324
- Howie, yes or no?

51:00.324 --> 51:04.895
- It's a yes for me.
- Mel?

51:04.895 --> 51:07.464
- Definite, definite
yes from me.

51:07.464 --> 51:09.066
- Heidi?
- Definite yes.

51:09.066 --> 51:11.001
Of course it is.

51:11.001 --> 51:13.010
- Moya, you got four yeses.

51:13.010 --> 51:13.304
- Moya, you got four yeses.

51:13.304 --> 51:14.905
Congratulations.

51:17.775 --> 51:18.809
Well done.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.377
- Yes!

51:25.015 --> 51:26.417
- Wow.

51:26.417 --> 51:27.985
- That was amazing.
- It was good.

51:27.985 --> 51:29.320
- And--and she went up,

51:29.320 --> 51:31.589
and then she went even more up.

51:31.589 --> 51:35.459
- Oh, my gosh!

51:35.459 --> 51:37.328
- We are so proud of you.
- Thank you.

51:37.328 --> 51:40.598
- Oh! Moya! That was so good!

51:49.006 --> 51:50.307
- Do you know if you win
the show,

51:50.307 --> 51:51.208
you'll win a million dollars?

51:51.208 --> 51:52.610
- Ah ha!

51:52.610 --> 51:54.178
- ♪ Money, money,
money, money ♪

51:54.178 --> 51:55.446
- What would you do
with a million dollars?

51:55.446 --> 51:58.582
- I would buy a wig, girl.
- Okay!

51:58.582 --> 52:00.317
- I'm gonna rent a plane.

52:00.317 --> 52:01.986
I'm going to south of France.

52:01.986 --> 52:03.754
- South of France?
- I'm gonna be on the beach.

52:03.754 --> 52:04.888
You can be over there naked.

52:04.888 --> 52:06.957
You can be as fat
as you want to be,

52:06.957 --> 52:08.592
if you got some money.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.260
- I mean, if we win
"America's Got Talent"--

52:10.260 --> 52:12.329
- Well--
- And we get a million dollars--

52:12.329 --> 52:14.531
- I'm not sure it's gonna go
quite that way.

52:14.531 --> 52:16.070
- I'm Owen. I'm 49 years old.

52:16.070 --> 52:16.367
- I'm Owen. I'm 49 years old.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.268
- I'm Jon, also 49.

52:18.268 --> 52:19.770
- We are called
The Passing Zone,

52:19.770 --> 52:21.438
and we're based
in Southern California.

52:21.438 --> 52:24.441
- So what do y'all do?
- We do a juggling act.

52:24.441 --> 52:26.944
We actually met
at a juggling convention,

52:26.944 --> 52:28.579
and we got to be friends,
and we figured

52:28.579 --> 52:29.880
we'd try this for a while

52:29.880 --> 52:31.782
until we got real jobs later.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.951
- Yeah, still looking
for the real job though.

52:33.951 --> 52:35.185
- Yeah.

52:35.185 --> 52:36.687
What do you think, top button,
no top button?

52:36.687 --> 52:38.756
- No, I think top button.
- That's the key.

52:38.756 --> 52:40.157
We don't have
accidents very often.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.159
- Right, no.
- Every time we go out on stage,

52:42.159 --> 52:44.128
there are a thousand things
that can go wrong.

52:44.128 --> 52:45.696
Less dropping, more catching.

52:45.696 --> 52:46.070
- Okay.
- We're here to win all the way.

52:46.070 --> 52:47.765
- Okay.
- We're here to win all the way.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.033
- All the way.
- We have to win it.

52:49.033 --> 52:51.301
- Going for the gold.
- We're here to win.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.539
- Hello.
- Hi there.

52:55.539 --> 52:56.640
- Hey.
- Good evening.

52:56.640 --> 52:57.841
What's your names?

52:57.841 --> 52:59.543
- My name is Jon.
- Yeah, and I'm Owen.

52:59.543 --> 53:01.645
We are called,
The Passing Zone.

53:01.645 --> 53:02.980
- We're a juggling duo.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.715
- How long have you
been doing this?

53:04.715 --> 53:07.584
- We've been working together
for 28 years now.

53:07.584 --> 53:08.619
- Wow.
- Yeah.

53:08.619 --> 53:09.887
- So you make
a living doing this?

53:09.887 --> 53:10.988
- Well--
- We do.

53:10.988 --> 53:12.322
That's the hardest
juggling trick

53:12.322 --> 53:15.893
we do is making a living at it.

53:15.893 --> 53:16.070
- Well, go ahead.
Solve the problem.

53:16.070 --> 53:17.394
- Well, go ahead.
Solve the problem.

53:17.394 --> 53:20.030
- We have something we think
you're going to enjoy--well,

53:20.030 --> 53:21.265
three of you will--
- Yes.

53:21.265 --> 53:24.001
- Because we need
Howie to help us.

53:24.001 --> 53:25.402
- Good man.
- That's right.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.671
- Howie, would you--
- Let's give Howie a big hand.

53:27.671 --> 53:29.306
- Yes, let's hear it for him.

53:29.306 --> 53:30.874
- Come on up.
- Join us.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.076
- Here he comes.
- All right.

53:32.076 --> 53:35.379
- Okay.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.581
- Where do I go?
- Right here in between us.

53:37.581 --> 53:38.949
Right there.
- Hi. Hi.

53:38.949 --> 53:40.617
- Well, Howie, you are about

53:40.617 --> 53:43.187
to help us with a very exciting
and dangerous stunt.

53:43.187 --> 53:45.055
Why don't you grab
the first item, John.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.070
Oh, yeah.

53:46.070 --> 53:48.058
Oh, yeah.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.693
Yes, it just got real.

53:49.693 --> 53:51.428
- Uh-huh.

53:51.428 --> 53:54.565
This is the real thing,
500,000 volts.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.266
Don't touch this end.
- Exactly.

53:56.266 --> 53:58.535
- So here are the
three danger items.

53:58.535 --> 53:59.870
- Right.
- Now we're gonna tell you

53:59.870 --> 54:01.105
what we need you to do.

54:01.105 --> 54:03.774
Howie, just take a couple steps
back if you would.

54:03.774 --> 54:06.243
We just need you to lie down.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.479
Lie down on the yoga mat
on your back

54:08.479 --> 54:09.813
with your feet toward me, okay?

54:09.813 --> 54:10.948
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

54:10.948 --> 54:12.216
- Yeah, yeah.
This is gonna happen.

54:12.216 --> 54:13.350
- You'll be just fine.
You'll be fine.

54:13.350 --> 54:14.485
- Yeah.
- Right there on your back.

54:14.485 --> 54:15.919
- Just sort of lie down.
- Feet toward me.

54:15.919 --> 54:16.070
Okay.

54:16.070 --> 54:18.856
Okay.

54:18.856 --> 54:20.057
- Oh.
- Al right, Howie,

54:20.057 --> 54:21.592
this is what's gonna happen now.

54:21.592 --> 54:25.596
I'm gonna straddle your body
right like this.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.232
Then I'm gonna start
juggling these items

54:28.232 --> 54:30.934
right over your general face
and nipple region.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.237
- Move it away!
- Jon is gonna come running

54:33.237 --> 54:34.772
and jump over both of us

54:34.772 --> 54:37.241
and land on the other side
of your head.

54:37.241 --> 54:39.910
- What could possibly
go wrong, huh?

54:39.910 --> 54:42.112
- Exactly. Okay, Howie,

54:42.112 --> 54:43.747
if you could just grab my ankles

54:43.747 --> 54:45.549
on either side of your body,
hang on there.

54:45.549 --> 54:46.070
- There you go. Yeah.
- Really?

54:46.070 --> 54:46.583
- There you go. Yeah.
- Really?

54:46.583 --> 54:47.985
- Just hold on tight.
- Very nice.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.720
- Right there.
- I just sterilized them.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.221
They're fine.

54:51.221 --> 54:53.791
- Now, Howie--Howie, you're
not gonna like this next part.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.058
- I don't like this part.

54:55.058 --> 54:56.460
- I don't think he'll like
any of this.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.428
- Okay, that's fine.
I'm sorry to ask you this,

54:58.428 --> 55:00.564
but I need you to spread
your legs apart.

55:00.564 --> 55:02.366
- Yeah.
- I know.

55:02.366 --> 55:04.835
I do 'cause
it's the only way it works.

55:04.835 --> 55:06.603
- This is--
Just spread.

55:06.603 --> 55:08.639
There you go.
That's nice.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.073
- Nice. Nice. Just like that.

55:10.073 --> 55:11.141
- Beautiful.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.543
- Glad he didn't ask me
to do that.

55:12.543 --> 55:16.070
- Oh, my gosh, Howie, we almost
safety goggles.

55:16.070 --> 55:16.113
- Oh, my gosh, Howie, we almost
safety goggles.

55:16.113 --> 55:17.514
- Ooh, that's right.
- Folks, I got to tell you,

55:17.514 --> 55:19.249
this is a very dangerous stunt.

55:19.249 --> 55:22.052
- We wouldn't do it without
the proper safety equipment.

55:22.052 --> 55:23.954
- Jon, for Howie.
- Oh, for Howie.

55:23.954 --> 55:25.289
For Howie? Okay. That's good.

55:25.289 --> 55:26.657
- Come on. What are you doing?
- Howie, right there.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.959
- Very nice, Howie.
- Okay, good. Here we go.

55:28.959 --> 55:30.627
- Are you ready back there?
- Howie, keep your head down.

55:30.627 --> 55:32.830
- Keep your head down.
- Keep your head down, Howie.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.265
- I don't want to do this. What?
- Head back, Howie.

55:35.265 --> 55:36.900
- Head down!
- You're gonna be fine.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.168
- All right, right there.

55:38.168 --> 55:41.839
Do not move. Let's do it.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.407
- Here we go, Howie.

55:43.407 --> 55:44.808
- Hold still, Howie.

55:47.311 --> 55:48.946
- This is for real, my friend.

55:48.946 --> 55:50.347
- This is gonna happen.

55:54.618 --> 55:57.054
- Ah!

56:01.158 --> 56:03.927
- Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

56:06.196 --> 56:08.265
It's Howie Mandel!

56:08.265 --> 56:10.367
There he is!

56:10.367 --> 56:11.735
He's done it!

56:11.735 --> 56:15.572
Oh, my God!
There he goes! Howie!

56:15.572 --> 56:16.070
- Might want to check
your pants, Howie.

56:16.070 --> 56:17.407
- Might want to check
your pants, Howie.

56:17.407 --> 56:20.277
- That was it!
You did it.

56:20.277 --> 56:21.778
- Oh, my God.
- That was so awesome.

56:21.778 --> 56:23.847
- That was scary.
- It was so good.

56:23.847 --> 56:26.049
- Yeah.
- So good.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.851
- Oh!

56:32.556 --> 56:33.824
You guys lied to me.

56:33.824 --> 56:36.426
You said you were gonna do
something dangerous.

56:36.426 --> 56:38.195
I did something dangerous.

56:38.195 --> 56:39.863
- Good point. Yes.

56:39.863 --> 56:41.832
- I always love a trick
that involves Howie

56:41.832 --> 56:43.333
and makes him feel
super uncomfortable,

56:43.333 --> 56:44.468
so thank you for doing that.

56:44.468 --> 56:46.070
- Yes.
- Our little gift to you.

56:46.070 --> 56:46.803
- Yes.
- Our little gift to you.

56:46.803 --> 56:48.538
- I like your guys' shtick.

56:48.538 --> 56:50.941
From start to end, you had me.
I loved it.

56:50.941 --> 56:52.709
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Mel B.

56:52.709 --> 56:54.344
- I was really entertained.

56:54.344 --> 56:55.679
I was laughing the whole time.

56:55.679 --> 56:57.381
I can't wait to see
what you do next.

56:57.381 --> 56:58.649
- Thank you.
- With Howie.

56:58.649 --> 57:01.051
- With Howie, yeah.
- Why do I have to be involved?

57:01.051 --> 57:03.053
- Yeah, you do.
- Yeah, it was good,

57:03.053 --> 57:05.255
and it actually--
if it had gone wrong,

57:05.255 --> 57:08.659
that would've been
an absolute nightmare.

57:08.659 --> 57:11.194
- I'm just loving this combo
of you three.

57:11.194 --> 57:13.263
It's a definite yes.

57:13.263 --> 57:15.565
- Absolutely. Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

57:15.565 --> 57:16.070
- We are agreed, Jon and Owen,

57:16.070 --> 57:17.367
- We are agreed, Jon and Owen,

57:17.367 --> 57:19.803
that it does involve Howie
the next round, doesn't it?

57:19.803 --> 57:21.838
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- So we have an agreement.

57:21.838 --> 57:23.240
- We have an agreement.
- Good you--

57:26.710 --> 57:29.713
You have three yeses.

57:35.852 --> 57:38.522
- That was so scary!

57:38.522 --> 57:41.124
- You might get hurt.
- You might get--

57:41.124 --> 57:42.993
- That stuff was real.
There was no joke there.

57:42.993 --> 57:44.728
- I know. I know. I know.

57:44.728 --> 57:45.963
- There we go.
- Look at that!

57:45.963 --> 57:46.070
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Oh, my goodness.

57:46.070 --> 57:48.098
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Oh, my goodness.

57:48.098 --> 57:49.399
- Howie's a rock star.
- Oh, my God.

57:49.399 --> 57:51.868
- You were so cute laying there
all scared and stuff.

57:51.868 --> 57:55.238
- You looked really--yeah,
you did look cute all scared.

57:55.238 --> 57:57.874
You did.

57:59.843 --> 58:01.845
Are you kidding me?

58:01.845 --> 58:04.247
Ah!

58:04.247 --> 58:07.918
- ♪ Just let me entertain you ♪

58:09.386 --> 58:11.388
- You are funny.

58:11.388 --> 58:12.556
- ♪ Yes, yes, sir ♪

58:12.556 --> 58:14.458
- 11-year-olds are
taking over the world.

58:14.458 --> 58:16.070
- I'm gonna break the rules.
- Oh, my God!

58:16.070 --> 58:17.561
- I'm gonna break the rules.
- Oh, my God!

58:22.766 --> 58:25.035
- The last day.
- It's the last day.

58:25.035 --> 58:26.336
- What are you doing?

58:26.336 --> 58:28.305
- I'm doing yoga and magic
at the same time.

58:28.305 --> 58:30.374
- To me, this is always
the most fun.

58:30.374 --> 58:32.476
- There's so many
different types of people.

58:32.476 --> 58:33.810
- You never know
what you're gonna see.

58:33.810 --> 58:36.380
- This is Warrior Two.
- Okay.

58:36.380 --> 58:37.948
Pick a card.

58:37.948 --> 58:40.017
- Because you see these people
come up with that crazy stuff,

58:40.017 --> 58:41.218
where you're like, "Really?"

58:41.218 --> 58:43.587
There is no talent here.

58:43.587 --> 58:44.821
- I mean, this is "AGT."

58:44.821 --> 58:47.524
Like, where else can you
get this shot, right?

58:47.524 --> 58:51.028
- Okay, tell us about yourself.
Go ahead.

58:51.028 --> 58:51.031
- My name is Steven Brundage.
I'm 25, and I'm from New York.

58:51.031 --> 58:54.598
- My name is Steven Brundage.
I'm 25, and I'm from New York.

58:57.267 --> 58:59.736
At 13, my cousin showed me
the Rubik's Cube.

58:59.736 --> 59:01.271
I was hooked right away.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.640
In, like, two days,
I learned how to solve it.

59:03.640 --> 59:06.610
My mom bought me a book,
and it just slowly took over.

59:06.610 --> 59:09.646
In high school, I was never
the most popular kid.

59:09.646 --> 59:11.014
During study hall...

59:11.014 --> 59:14.551
I would solve my Rubik's Cube.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.854
I've probably solved it
over...

59:17.854 --> 59:19.489
70,000 times.

59:21.391 --> 59:22.592
I'm currently single now.

59:22.592 --> 59:23.927
I did date a girl once,

59:23.927 --> 59:26.696
but we broke up
due to the Rubik's Cube.

59:26.696 --> 59:29.833
I would practice around six
to eight hours a day nonstop.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.139
So it didn't help.

59:36.139 --> 59:38.375
- Get out there
and twist it all up.

59:38.375 --> 59:39.376
- Thank you, man.

59:39.376 --> 59:40.544
- Have fun.
- Awesome.

59:40.544 --> 59:41.812
But when I think back
on high school,

59:41.812 --> 59:45.348
I think I was once voted
least likely to succeed,

59:45.348 --> 59:47.684
so it's kind of fun
being on "America's Got Talent"

59:47.684 --> 59:50.353
and hopefully doing
something big here.

59:50.353 --> 59:51.031
Cool.

59:51.031 --> 59:52.689
Cool.

59:55.125 --> 59:57.394
- Hi. Who are you?

59:57.394 --> 59:58.995
- My name is Steven Brundage.

59:58.995 --> 1:00:01.164
- What are you doing for us
today with those bags?

1:00:01.164 --> 1:00:03.733
- I am going to do
Rubik's Cube magic today.

1:00:03.733 --> 1:00:05.302
- Rubik's Cube magic?

1:00:05.302 --> 1:00:06.670
- The act that I do--

1:00:06.670 --> 1:00:09.473
I'm the only person in the world
that actually does it.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.008
- I can't wait to see it.

1:00:12.008 --> 1:00:13.610
- Awesome.
Can I step down towards you?

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:15.045
- All right.

1:00:20.851 --> 1:00:21.031
- Awesome. So we're gonna try
something with the Rubik's Cube.

1:00:21.031 --> 1:00:23.587
- Awesome. So we're gonna try
something with the Rubik's Cube.

1:00:23.587 --> 1:00:25.522
We're gonna mix it up
on all six sides.

1:00:25.522 --> 1:00:27.190
Now, there's 43 quintillion
different ways

1:00:27.190 --> 1:00:29.526
you can mix it up,
so watch that close.

1:00:29.526 --> 1:00:30.760
Completely mix it up.

1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:34.030
One-handed,
in the bag as fully as possible.

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:39.736
Back to solved.

1:00:39.736 --> 1:00:41.138
I think you have a guess
on how I do that, right?

1:00:41.138 --> 1:00:42.939
Some people guess there's
a second cube in the bag.

1:00:42.939 --> 1:00:44.141
I will prove the bag is empty.

1:00:44.141 --> 1:00:46.843
Look, I'll check.
Completely empty.

1:00:48.411 --> 1:00:51.031
Completely empty.

1:00:51.031 --> 1:00:51.047
Completely empty.

1:00:51.047 --> 1:00:53.517
- Can I look in it?
- Absolutely.

1:00:54.751 --> 1:00:56.520
- Very good.

1:00:58.822 --> 1:01:01.091
- How did he do that?

1:01:01.091 --> 1:01:04.761
- I'm gonna do something that's
never been done before on TV

1:01:04.761 --> 1:01:06.296
Simon, can you actually mix up
that Rubik's Cube?

1:01:06.296 --> 1:01:07.664
Turn it as much as you want.

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:09.132
Now, every time you turn it,

1:01:09.132 --> 1:01:11.034
that's a different one of those
43 quintillion permutations.

1:01:11.034 --> 1:01:12.903
Simon, whenever you're happy,
I will take the cube

1:01:12.903 --> 1:01:14.871
that you just mixed up
and put it back in the bag.

1:01:14.871 --> 1:01:16.373
Watch that close.

1:01:16.373 --> 1:01:18.308
Simon's mixed-up Rubik's Cube.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:21.031
- Well, that's incredible.

1:01:21.031 --> 1:01:22.946
- Well, that's incredible.

1:01:22.946 --> 1:01:24.881
- That would be
an amazing trick

1:01:24.881 --> 1:01:28.018
if there was not a second
Rubik's Cube in the bag.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.553
But that's not the trick.

1:01:29.553 --> 1:01:31.021
I'm making sure
you're still paying attention.

1:01:31.021 --> 1:01:32.522
Simon, can you actually
cover it up on all six sides,

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:34.991
but don't turn it like that.
Cover it up.

1:01:34.991 --> 1:01:36.459
Perfect.
Like that, yeah.

1:01:36.459 --> 1:01:37.794
Now, when you think
of a solved Rubik's Cube,

1:01:37.794 --> 1:01:39.629
what do you actually picture?

1:01:39.629 --> 1:01:41.031
- Solids.
- Colors, right?

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:43.333
What if I told you that I found
a different solution

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:44.868
to the Rubik's Cube?

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:46.036
Watch close.

1:01:48.905 --> 1:01:51.031
Right about...

1:01:51.031 --> 1:01:52.409
Right about...

1:01:52.409 --> 1:01:53.910
right about there.

1:01:53.910 --> 1:01:56.613
See, the different solution
was to match the Rubik's Cube

1:01:56.613 --> 1:01:59.983
that Simon
mixed up 30 seconds ago.

1:01:59.983 --> 1:02:01.952
- You have.
- No.

1:02:01.952 --> 1:02:04.254
- So, if I did match it, you're
gonna notice we have one side

1:02:04.254 --> 1:02:08.058
that's gonna be
a completely...

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:09.793
Perfect match.

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:13.196
- Magic is real!

1:02:13.196 --> 1:02:16.032
- Better
than one side, though,

1:02:16.032 --> 1:02:18.235
that's gonna be
side number two.

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:19.836
That is three.

1:02:19.836 --> 1:02:21.031
That is four.
That is five.

1:02:21.031 --> 1:02:21.338
That is four.
That is five.

1:02:21.338 --> 1:02:23.974
That is all six sides
are completely perfect matches.

1:02:27.143 --> 1:02:29.045
- How the hell'd you do that?

1:02:35.385 --> 1:02:38.255
- That's amazing.

1:02:40.056 --> 1:02:42.425
- Steven, I have to say,
I'm blown away.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.660
- Thank you.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:46.696
- How did you do that?
- Magic. It's magic.

1:02:46.696 --> 1:02:48.064
- No, he's a wizard.

1:02:48.064 --> 1:02:49.566
- No, you are a wizard.
- Wow.

1:02:49.566 --> 1:02:50.734
- Thank you.

1:02:50.734 --> 1:02:51.031
- There is no other
explanation for that.

1:02:51.031 --> 1:02:53.270
- There is no other
explanation for that.

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:54.671
There isn't.

1:02:54.671 --> 1:02:57.607
So that has to be magic.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:59.276
- That was incredible.
- Thank you.

1:02:59.276 --> 1:03:02.145
- It really was,
and we do see a lot of magic,

1:03:02.145 --> 1:03:04.914
and especially up close,
I'm always like Hawkeye.

1:03:04.914 --> 1:03:06.850
I'm, like,
right in that business,

1:03:06.850 --> 1:03:08.551
and I couldn't see anything.

1:03:08.551 --> 1:03:10.687
- That was unbelievable.
- Mm-hmm.

1:03:10.687 --> 1:03:12.489
- I don't know how you did it.
- Thank you.

1:03:16.026 --> 1:03:19.229
- Mel, what did you think?
- Well, I love magic.

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:21.031
And you just made me fall
in love with magic even more.

1:03:21.031 --> 1:03:22.666
And you just made me fall
in love with magic even more.

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:25.135
- Thank you.
- That's it.

1:03:25.135 --> 1:03:27.737

1:03:27.737 --> 1:03:30.907
- I agree
with my fellow judges.

1:03:30.907 --> 1:03:32.509
It was fantastic.

1:03:41.184 --> 1:03:42.519
- Simon?

1:03:42.519 --> 1:03:45.021
- And I'm gonna give you
a fourth yes.

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:50.527
- Wow.
- I don't know how he did that.

1:03:50.527 --> 1:03:51.031
- But even
the very first thing,

1:03:51.031 --> 1:03:52.062
- But even
the very first thing,

1:03:52.062 --> 1:03:53.897
when he put the mixed one in

1:03:53.897 --> 1:03:55.965
and then it came out
all perfect?

1:03:55.965 --> 1:03:57.567
- Wow.
- Awesome.

1:03:57.567 --> 1:03:59.169
- I don't think we've ever seen
anything like that, man.

1:03:59.169 --> 1:04:01.771
- Oh, it was fun.
- This has been good.

1:04:01.771 --> 1:04:03.139
Good acts.

1:04:04.140 --> 1:04:05.141

1:04:10.213 --> 1:04:11.281
What is your name?

1:04:11.281 --> 1:04:14.451
- I'm Karoly Zeman.
- Ana Zeman.

1:04:14.451 --> 1:04:16.753
- And we are the Zeman Duo.

1:04:16.753 --> 1:04:19.022
- Well, I wish you guys
good luck.

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:24.361
- Oh!

1:04:34.804 --> 1:04:36.740
- Are you kidding me?

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:40.076
Aah!

1:04:40.076 --> 1:04:41.611
- Whoa!

1:04:47.217 --> 1:04:49.285
- I'm gonna give you
your fourth yes.

1:04:49.285 --> 1:04:50.954
Congratulations,
in the next round.

1:04:50.954 --> 1:04:51.031
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1:04:53.590 --> 1:04:54.991

1:04:54.991 --> 1:04:56.025
- Yeah.
- Huh, guys?

1:04:56.025 --> 1:04:57.494
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

1:04:57.494 --> 1:04:59.429
- All right, what's your name?
- Adam Grabowski.

1:04:59.429 --> 1:05:01.197
- And you're gonna do what?
- Stand-up.

1:05:01.197 --> 1:05:03.333
- All right.
- Can I start by saying

1:05:03.333 --> 1:05:05.802
I love Disney movies?
Okay, I--Yes.

1:05:05.802 --> 1:05:06.970
- Me too.
- I just don't know

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:10.273
how we get away
with showing them to children.

1:05:10.273 --> 1:05:12.308
Do you guys remember
"The Little Mermaid,"

1:05:12.308 --> 1:05:14.677
the one where Ariel trades
her voice for legs,

1:05:14.677 --> 1:05:16.613
and the prince
finds her naked on a beach,

1:05:16.613 --> 1:05:19.616
and she can't talk,
and he falls in love with her?

1:05:22.585 --> 1:05:24.821
Is that how love works?

1:05:24.821 --> 1:05:26.389
Pretty sure he doesn't know
anything about her.

1:05:26.389 --> 1:05:27.724
All he knows
is she's got who's-its

1:05:27.724 --> 1:05:30.160
and what's-its galore.

1:05:31.961 --> 1:05:36.633
He wants thingamabobs,
and she's got 20, okay?

1:05:36.633 --> 1:05:39.702
- Very funny.
- I thoroughly belly-laughed.

1:05:39.702 --> 1:05:41.037
You are funny.

1:05:41.037 --> 1:05:42.472
- You're really funny.
You should be very proud.

1:05:42.472 --> 1:05:43.540
- Thank you, Howie.
That means a lot.

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:44.841
- You've got four yeses, Adam.

1:05:44.841 --> 1:05:46.843
Well done.
- Thank you.

1:05:46.843 --> 1:05:48.945
- He was the funniest one.
- Yeah, he was.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:50.914
- Skylar.
- Nick.

1:05:50.914 --> 1:05:51.031

- R & B singing?
- That's what it is.

1:08:02.378 --> 1:08:03.846
- For the ladies?
- That's it.

1:08:03.846 --> 1:08:05.381
So I'm an ex bodybuilder.

1:08:05.381 --> 1:08:08.017

to see me flexing,

1:08:08.017 --> 1:08:09.485
I hear them scream,

1:08:09.485 --> 1:08:11.854
just like when I'm hitting
those high notes in my singing.

1:08:11.854 --> 1:08:12.922
You got a good look too.

1:08:12.922 --> 1:08:13.923

want to come over

all the time.

1:08:21.264 --> 1:08:23.032
Even in the mall,
I'm going shopping,

1:08:23.032 --> 1:08:24.100
and I have a tank top on,

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:26.970
they want to just
touch the muscles.

1:08:26.970 --> 1:08:28.972
Women love my hair.

1:08:28.972 --> 1:08:31.274
They always want to know
if it's real or not,

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:33.376
but, you know, they're always
shocked when it is.

1:08:33.376 --> 1:08:34.711
You're a very
attractive lady.

1:08:34.711 --> 1:08:36.546
- Thank you.

1:08:36.546 --> 1:08:37.714
to be on the show as well.

1:08:37.714 --> 1:08:39.616
I mean, do you sing or anything?
- I don't.

1:08:39.616 --> 1:08:43.519

RL Bell, go get 'em, player.

1:08:43.519 --> 1:08:45.121

1:09:26.763 --> 1:09:28.765
- Do you ever combine the two?
Do you ever sing when you're--

1:09:28.765 --> 1:09:30.700
- Well, you know what?
I have, and they say,

1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:33.670
"Do you mind singing to me
while you massage?"

1:09:33.670 --> 1:09:35.972
And, Howie,
that's kind of hard to do

1:09:35.972 --> 1:09:37.407
'cause I'm trying to focus
on my hands,

1:09:37.407 --> 1:09:39.075
but then I'm trying to focus
with the voice too.

1:09:39.075 --> 1:09:40.343
- Right.
- So what I did,

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:42.045
I just put in a CD of mine

1:09:42.045 --> 1:09:45.314

- Thank you.

1:12:14.096 --> 1:12:16.032
- Okay. Heidi?

1:12:16.032 --> 1:12:16.365
- Okay. Heidi?

1:12:16.365 --> 1:12:19.135
- I thought
it was quite a journey.

1:12:19.135 --> 1:12:21.003
Wow. And the coat came off,

1:12:21.003 --> 1:12:23.105
and the voice went up
and down and everywhere.

1:12:23.105 --> 1:12:25.942
And the muscles were going.

1:12:25.942 --> 1:12:27.710
I mean,
it was very entertaining,

1:12:27.710 --> 1:12:29.245
and you do have a great voice.

1:12:29.245 --> 1:12:32.215
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Simon?

1:12:32.215 --> 1:12:35.051
- RL, I like a little bit
of sugar in my tea,

1:12:35.051 --> 1:12:37.286
but I like one teaspoon.

1:12:37.286 --> 1:12:41.157
That was like
a whole bag of sugar

1:12:41.157 --> 1:12:44.994
because it was getting
so corny.

1:12:44.994 --> 1:12:46.032
Practically turned into

1:12:46.032 --> 1:12:46.696
Practically turned into

1:12:46.696 --> 1:12:49.565
a striptease halfway through.

1:12:49.565 --> 1:12:52.835
We kind of got to de-corny you

1:12:52.835 --> 1:12:55.304
and make it
all about your voice,

1:12:55.304 --> 1:12:57.740
not the silly outfits,
taking your clothes off,

1:12:57.740 --> 1:13:00.109
because that
won't get you anywhere,

1:13:00.109 --> 1:13:01.777
but you do have a great voice.

1:13:01.777 --> 1:13:03.312
- You know the reason
why I did it, though?

1:13:03.312 --> 1:13:04.614
- Tell me.

1:13:04.614 --> 1:13:06.315
- The reason why I did it was
because I really wanted

1:13:06.315 --> 1:13:08.217
Mrs. Jones to know
what I was talking about.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:11.854
- Oh, of course.

1:13:11.854 --> 1:13:15.124
- Well, unlike Simon, I actually
liked the whole showmanship.

1:13:15.124 --> 1:13:16.032
I think you've got
a bit of a chance at this

1:13:16.032 --> 1:13:17.126
I think you've got
a bit of a chance at this

1:13:17.126 --> 1:13:20.897
because you do have
a really good voice.

1:13:20.897 --> 1:13:22.365
- You know, to me,
I agree with Simon.

1:13:22.365 --> 1:13:23.699
You took away from your voice.

1:13:23.699 --> 1:13:25.368
It was kind of like Rick James,

1:13:25.368 --> 1:13:28.237
Sammy Davis Jr.,
and Hulk Hogan had a child.

1:13:29.538 --> 1:13:32.308
- I think the boys are just
jealous of the muscles.

1:13:32.308 --> 1:13:35.745
- I think the girls liked it.
- Let's face it.

1:13:35.745 --> 1:13:37.680
- All right, so let's vote.

1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:40.082
I agree with Simon 100%,

1:13:40.082 --> 1:13:42.985
but I don't think when he's
talking to you that you get it,

1:13:42.985 --> 1:13:45.087
so I'm giving you a no.

1:13:46.322 --> 1:13:48.524
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1:13:48.524 --> 1:13:50.893
- That's wrong.
- Heidi?

1:13:50.893 --> 1:13:52.395
- See, I totally disagree.

1:13:52.395 --> 1:13:55.498
I think that you should amp up
even more what you were doing.

1:13:55.498 --> 1:13:58.134
- What?
- I do. I'm giving you a yes.

1:13:58.134 --> 1:14:00.970
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Mel?

1:14:00.970 --> 1:14:03.439
- Yes, I'd like
to see you again.

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:05.274
- Thank you, dear. Thank you.

1:14:05.274 --> 1:14:08.411
- What do you say, Simon?
- I don't know.

1:14:08.411 --> 1:14:11.480
Put him through.
Put him through.

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:14.317

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:20.423
- Okay, okay.
RL, okay, based on the audition,

1:14:20.423 --> 1:14:23.292
it would've been
a million percent no.

1:14:23.292 --> 1:14:27.296
Based on where I think
you could go possibly,

1:14:27.296 --> 1:14:29.565
I'm gonna take a shot
and say yes.

1:14:29.565 --> 1:14:31.701
- Thank you, sir.

1:14:31.701 --> 1:14:33.302
Thank you all so much.

1:14:33.302 --> 1:14:34.704

1:14:37.239 --> 1:14:39.275

1:14:39.275 --> 1:14:42.144
I liked it.

- RL Bell!

1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.032
Ow!

1:14:46.032 --> 1:14:47.383
Ow!

1:14:47.383 --> 1:14:49.218
You going through, man.
How's it feel?

1:14:49.218 --> 1:14:50.886
- Hey, wonderful.

1:14:53.155 --> 1:14:54.523
- And, Dorothy,
how old are you, darling?

1:14:54.523 --> 1:14:56.492
- I'm 90 years old.
- Wow.

1:14:56.492 --> 1:14:57.626
- Wow.
- What?

1:14:57.626 --> 1:14:59.428
- So what are you gonna do
for us today?

1:14:59.428 --> 1:15:00.963
- Well, I'm going to dance.

1:15:00.963 --> 1:15:02.865
- Oh!

1:15:05.034 --> 1:15:07.770
- Oh, my God.

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:15.978
- Is that it?
- No.

1:15:15.978 --> 1:15:17.346
- Are we good?
- No.

1:15:17.346 --> 1:15:19.448
- We're done.
- No, we're not.

1:15:19.448 --> 1:15:21.384
- No. One act left.

1:15:21.384 --> 1:15:22.985
- Hello.
- Aloha.

1:15:22.985 --> 1:15:24.987
- Aloha. How are you?
- I'm fine.

1:15:24.987 --> 1:15:26.822
- My name is Nick.

1:15:26.822 --> 1:15:28.057
and I'm from Hilo, Hawaii.

1:15:28.057 --> 1:15:29.225
- All right, Miss Dorothy,

1:15:29.225 --> 1:15:30.893
what are you gonna do
for us today?

1:15:30.893 --> 1:15:32.194
- I'm gonna dance.

1:15:32.194 --> 1:15:36.365
I was born in Chicago, Illinois,
in 1926.

1:15:36.365 --> 1:15:39.769

- When I was 17,
I learned how to dance.

1:15:43.139 --> 1:15:44.473
I joined a chorus line.

1:15:44.473 --> 1:15:46.242
We traveled
around the United States,

1:15:46.242 --> 1:15:48.244
six nights
and three shows a night,

1:15:48.244 --> 1:15:51.947
and that's when it became like,
"I'm somebody."

1:15:51.947 --> 1:15:54.283
- If you don't mind me asking,
how young are you?

1:15:54.283 --> 1:15:55.618
- 90.

1:15:55.618 --> 1:15:57.853
- Wow, why did you take
this moment at 90 years old

1:15:57.853 --> 1:15:59.855
to come and perform
on "America's Got Talent"?

1:15:59.855 --> 1:16:02.825
- Because I started
in show business when I was 17.

1:16:02.825 --> 1:16:04.727
- Okay.
- I never got to be a star.

1:16:06.495 --> 1:16:08.697
When I got to be 23
and realized

1:16:08.697 --> 1:16:11.500
I hadn't gotten to be a star,

1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:12.041
I didn't know what I wanted
to do with my life.

1:16:12.041 --> 1:16:14.103

- So, for the next 25 years,
I worked for the supermarket.

1:16:20.242 --> 1:16:23.012
After I retired, my husband
and I moved to Hawaii.

1:16:23.012 --> 1:16:26.115
In Hawaii, I'm a president
of a senior center,

1:16:26.115 --> 1:16:30.152
and I teach the hula class,

1:16:30.152 --> 1:16:33.656
but I never forgot
my passion for dancing.

1:16:33.656 --> 1:16:35.391
- You are a star.
- I hope so.

1:16:35.391 --> 1:16:37.126
- I deem you a star.
- All right.

1:16:37.126 --> 1:16:39.462
- It's happening right now.
- If you say it, it'll be so.

1:16:39.462 --> 1:16:40.763
- It's already happening.

bit more on the tassels.

- No, I get that.
I get that, but you know what?

1:20:42.938 --> 1:20:44.907
I kind of wanted
a longer song

1:20:44.907 --> 1:20:47.776

is gonna end up.

1:20:47.776 --> 1:20:50.346

1:21:07.763 --> 1:21:09.298
Oh, what's Nick gonna do?

1:21:09.298 --> 1:21:12.041
- Audience, we had
a conversation backstage,

1:21:12.041 --> 1:21:12.501
- Audience, we had
a conversation backstage,

1:21:12.501 --> 1:21:14.436
and Ms. Dorothy told me

1:21:14.436 --> 1:21:16.739
that all she dreamed
about all her life

1:21:16.739 --> 1:21:19.575
was being a star
in a moment like this.

1:21:19.575 --> 1:21:21.810
I told her,
"A star is born tonight."

1:21:21.810 --> 1:21:23.846
- I agree.
- I predicted it.

1:21:27.015 --> 1:21:30.386
Now, it's kind of unfortunate,
because on this show,

1:21:30.386 --> 1:21:34.156

once a season

1:21:34.156 --> 1:21:35.591
to hit the golden buzzer,

1:21:35.591 --> 1:21:38.394
and the act gets to go straight
through to the live shows,

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:41.830
but all of our judges
already hit their golden buzzer.

1:21:41.830 --> 1:21:42.041
But you know what? I don't care.
I'm gonna break the rules.

1:21:42.041 --> 1:21:45.167
But you know what? I don't care.
I'm gonna break the rules.

- How's it feel?

1:22:30.446 --> 1:22:31.847
You're going straight through
to the live shows.

1:22:31.847 --> 1:22:32.848
One more big performance.

1:22:32.848 --> 1:22:34.082
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

1:22:34.082 --> 1:22:35.551
- I hope I live that long.
- That was--

1:22:35.551 --> 1:22:37.386
- How cool was that,
the golden buzzer?

1:22:37.386 --> 1:22:38.520

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:52.901
and hit the golden buzzer.

1:22:52.901 --> 1:22:55.437
Ms. Dorothy,
sexiest lady alive.

1:22:55.437 --> 1:22:57.439
- Season 11, baby.

1:22:57.439 --> 1:23:00.275
- I think more names
from this season

1:23:00.275 --> 1:23:03.712
will become household names
than any season in the past.

1:23:03.712 --> 1:23:06.315
- I'm really, really impressed
with who we found.

1:23:06.315 --> 1:23:07.616
I'm excited.

1:23:07.616 --> 1:23:11.053

- You just never know
what happens on Judge Cuts.

1:23:24.233 --> 1:23:26.268
- It is make or break.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:29.471
- This is the time where
it has to be stepped up.

1:23:29.471 --> 1:23:32.808
- Our special guest judge
tonight--

1:23:32.808 --> 1:23:37.012
country legend Reba McEntire!

1:23:37.012 --> 1:23:38.747
- That was
the most depressing song

1:23:38.747 --> 1:23:40.983
I've ever heard in my life.

1:23:40.983 --> 1:23:42.041
- My man Ne-Yo!

1:23:42.041 --> 1:23:43.085

in Vegas right now.

1:23:46.421 --> 1:23:49.925
- Comedy legend George Lopez!

1:23:49.925 --> 1:23:52.060
- I've never seen
anything quite like it.

1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:54.563
It's hard to get swagger
in a sweater.

1:23:54.563 --> 1:23:58.000
- From One Direction,
it's Louis Tomlinson!

1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:02.604
- You are the coolest
six-year-old I have ever met.

1:24:02.604 --> 1:24:07.276
- I am nervous
as nervous could be.

1:24:08.744 --> 1:24:10.879
- You know that only seven
acts are gonna go through.

1:24:10.879 --> 1:24:12.041
There's a million dollars
at stake.

1:24:12.041 --> 1:24:14.783
There's a million dollars
at stake.

1:24:14.783 --> 1:24:16.385
- Oh!

1:24:16.385 --> 1:24:18.554
- Everything that we've done
in our life...

1:24:18.554 --> 1:24:19.555
- Wow!

1:24:19.555 --> 1:24:22.090
- Has come down
to this moment.

1:24:22.090 --> 1:24:23.592
Oh!

1:24:25.394 --> 1:24:30.432
- I am losing the will to live.

1:24:30.432 --> 1:24:32.834
- He threw a person
at the judges.

1:24:32.834 --> 1:24:35.537
- But I really liked it.

1:24:35.537 --> 1:24:37.472
- You can push that
golden buzzer

1:24:37.472 --> 1:24:39.274
and send them
to the live shows.

1:24:39.274 --> 1:24:42.041
- I think actions
speak louder than words.

1:24:42.041 --> 1:24:43.812
- I think actions
speak louder than words.

1:24:43.812 --> 1:24:45.380
- Aah!
