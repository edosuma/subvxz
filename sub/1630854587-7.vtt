00:12.458 --> 00:14.416
<i>Previously on </i>Paradise PD<i>…</i>

00:16.708 --> 00:20.625
<i>Sorry, wrong clip.</i>
<i>Uh, previously on </i>Paradise PD<i>…</i>

00:20.708 --> 00:23.625
I'm Splooge McDuck!

00:23.708 --> 00:25.708
Whee!

00:25.791 --> 00:28.250
<i>Oh, goddamn it!</i>
<i>Who the hell picked these clips?</i>

00:28.333 --> 00:31.333
All right, fuck it.
I'll just tell you what happened.

00:31.416 --> 00:35.208
Charles Lovely bought the town,
walled it off, and banished my son.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.958
AFKAK, not the cool baby.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.166
Roll the episode.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.083
Ain't I a stinker?

00:54.416 --> 00:56.708
Hey! I need to get in there.

00:56.791 --> 01:01.750
It's important. I need to warn my friends
about Charles Lovely's evil plans!

01:01.833 --> 01:05.583
Lord Lovely has decreed
that you shall not pass!

01:05.666 --> 01:08.541
Oh, cut the shit, Brad.
You work at Target.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.458
And you have a pollen allergy.

01:10.541 --> 01:14.458
I call it the Curse of Histamenia,

01:14.541 --> 01:17.416
placed upon me by the wizard Zyrtec.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.041
You asked for it.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.958
You dare attack me, scoundrel?

01:23.041 --> 01:27.458
Prepare thyself
to taste the pain of a thousand blows.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.250
It appears we're evenly matched.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.541
<i>Oh no, Mom.</i>
<i>You're stuck in the dryer again.</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:45.833
<i>It's these damn giant titties.</i>

01:45.916 --> 01:47.500
Good morning, everyone.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.166
What the hell's Gollum doing here?

01:51.250 --> 01:54.333
Due to the purchase
and takeover of Paradise--

01:54.416 --> 01:57.083
We don't have your ring!

01:57.166 --> 02:00.666
Please, don't sodomize us
next to a riverbank.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.708
That was <i>Deliverance</i>, Hopson.

02:02.791 --> 02:06.750
Just go with it. For once he said
he didn't want to be sodomized.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.541
Charles Lovely has taken pity
on you unemployed bums

02:10.625 --> 02:12.083
and given you all jobs.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.791
You will all be selling
Lovely products door-to-door.

02:15.875 --> 02:19.250
Except for you.
Your job's to let me smell your head.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.750
Ah! That's good shit!

02:24.541 --> 02:27.750
Now, let's go around the room
and introduce ourselves.

02:27.833 --> 02:31.125
I'll start. I'm Thester Carbomb IV.

02:31.208 --> 02:34.875
I'm a bit of an idiot,
and I like to raise and smother lemurs.

02:34.958 --> 02:35.916
Who's next?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.875
Howdy. Uh, I'm Bullet,
and I'm a talking dog.

02:38.958 --> 02:42.708
"A small Armenian man
who thinks he's a dog."

02:42.791 --> 02:44.208
I'm Dusty Marlow.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.875
I was a sweetheart
before I went to ladies' prison,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.041
and now I don't give a fuck.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.666
My friends call me Dr. Bro-Down McCools.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.791
We don't call you that.

02:52.875 --> 02:55.041
Who says you're my friends, assholes?

02:55.125 --> 02:57.000
What up, McCools?

02:57.083 --> 03:01.083
See you tonight, Blood Knife!
We gonna fuck up them Mayans!

03:02.708 --> 03:04.500
You, uh, care to elaborate, Dusty?

03:04.583 --> 03:06.833
I'm sorry, I don't speak Armenian.

03:07.541 --> 03:11.458
"Pretend to write
since I never learned how."

03:11.958 --> 03:12.916
Who's next?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.041
I'm Stanley Hopson,
and I like historical tidbits.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.875
Would you mind sharing one with us?

03:18.958 --> 03:22.250
You know our 32nd president, FDR?

03:22.333 --> 03:26.166
Well, he was just FR
before I slipped him the D.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.541
"Hopson. The smart one."

03:28.625 --> 03:30.291
You next. Who are you?

03:30.375 --> 03:31.875
Are you fucking serious?

03:31.958 --> 03:35.125
You don't remember me?
We turned the town into a pizza together!

03:35.208 --> 03:36.916
I see.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.958
"I wonder if they know

03:39.041 --> 03:43.291
that I am just drawing
an iguana with sunglasses

03:43.375 --> 03:46.666
since I am illiterate."

03:46.750 --> 03:47.833
Thester, listen!

03:47.916 --> 03:52.041
I'm gonna say what we're all thinking.
We don't wanna sell products door-to-door.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.250
And now I'm gonna say what I'm thinking.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.791
Why did Popeye always wait
so long to eat the spinach?

03:57.875 --> 04:00.916
Also, why didn't Bluto eat the spinach?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.916
Olive Oyl's the one who should be eating
the spinach. She looks bulimic.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.458
And also, why didn't Popeye
ever work out his upper arms?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.416
What the fuck's this gotta do with us?

04:11.500 --> 04:16.083
Right. Did I mention
that you'll be working on a point system

04:16.166 --> 04:18.916
and the top seller wins this prize?

04:20.583 --> 04:23.041
A six-slice toaster!

04:24.250 --> 04:26.333
Six slices! Is it from the future?

04:26.416 --> 04:28.166
Oh joy!

04:28.250 --> 04:31.125
Me and five other friends can fuck it.

04:31.208 --> 04:34.458
Ooh! Y'all are gonna be, dare I say…

04:35.083 --> 04:36.875
toast? You get it?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.541
You guys suck.

04:39.625 --> 04:43.208
I guess next time I'll just eat
my own asshole to get a laugh.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.750
I think that's the only thing
you haven't eaten today.

04:54.166 --> 04:55.625
Fuck all y'all!

04:56.291 --> 04:58.875
It's the Cadillac of toasters.

04:58.958 --> 05:02.916
Ever since I was a kid,
I've dreamt of owning a six-slice toaster.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.708
Yeah, baby! I'm making it grain!

05:26.833 --> 05:30.291
Wow, six slices of toast. Thanks, Karen.

05:30.375 --> 05:34.041
Yeah. It took me all morning
to make these with my four-slice toaster.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.125
Plus I had to throw away two slices.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.000
There's gotta be a better way.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.083
Anyway.

05:39.166 --> 05:43.875
Can you believe Charles Lovely paid
$10 million to buy this shithole town?

05:43.958 --> 05:45.916
What are we going to do
with all our new money?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.916
You don't have to worry about that, baby.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.666
I already invested it in a secure,
low-risk, recession-proof…

05:52.750 --> 05:54.208
Boat!

05:54.291 --> 05:57.625
So you spent $10 million on this?!

05:57.708 --> 05:59.291
No, I'm not stupid.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.250
Most of the money went to dig the canals.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.166
Randall, this is--

06:05.250 --> 06:06.125
Boat!

06:13.708 --> 06:15.750
Ahoy! You guys need some help?

06:15.833 --> 06:18.166
Oh, you betcha.
We could-- we could sure use some--

06:18.250 --> 06:19.083
Boat!

06:22.416 --> 06:26.083
Robby, know how we've been getting a check
from the government to homeschool Dobby?

06:26.166 --> 06:29.166
Yep. I've been teaching him
the big philosophical questions.

06:29.250 --> 06:32.166
Like why the fuck does Popeye
wait so long to eat the spinach?

06:32.250 --> 06:34.833
Also, if he can open that can
with his bare hands,

06:34.916 --> 06:37.458
why the fuck
don't he just crush Bluto's windpipe?

06:37.541 --> 06:40.958
Well, this letter here says
Dobby has to pass a standardized test

06:41.041 --> 06:41.916
or we're cut off.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh, shit.

06:43.083 --> 06:47.125
Okay, listen Dobby. I'm gonna teach you
how to pass that sand-or-rice test.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.791
They gonna give you
a bowl of sand and a bowl of rice.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.458
Eat the rice. Do not eat the sand.

06:52.541 --> 06:56.250
Not a sand-or-rice test.
A standardized test.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.125
Good. That sand-or-rice test is tough.

06:59.208 --> 07:03.875
This is serious. Dobby needs to learn
all his school subjects in one day.

07:03.958 --> 07:06.458
I can teach him everything
he needs to know.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.375
Just hand me my brain boost juice.

07:11.541 --> 07:13.000
You feeling smarter, Flobby?

07:13.083 --> 07:15.625
No, I don't think
this shit's working, Belzert.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.375
Hello. We're from Lovely Corp, and--

07:21.083 --> 07:23.625
Hi. We're from Lovely Corp.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.125
-Hello, we're from--
-We don't want none!

07:27.750 --> 07:29.541
This is my apartment, bitch!

07:29.625 --> 07:32.208
Hi! We're from Lovely Corp, and--

07:32.291 --> 07:37.000
Sorry, friendlies. I'm gonna have
to slam the door in your face, baby.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.750
What the fuck? Vlad?

08:03.833 --> 08:07.875
Hey! Bitch man!
Where you get that sissy boat?

08:07.958 --> 08:09.833
Sissy boat?!

08:09.916 --> 08:16.250
Real boat have disco ball,
kegerator, and Casio keyboard, bro!

08:16.333 --> 08:18.541
Just ask dead-eyed bikini girls

08:18.625 --> 08:22.916
or second richest man
in town, Camaro the Bob!

08:23.458 --> 08:27.666
What's the name of your boat, baby?
The SS Cock Chugger?

08:27.750 --> 08:28.583
No!

08:31.208 --> 08:33.625
Vlad even wrote boat song.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.375
Your boat song sucks,
and everyone's gonna hate it!

08:44.458 --> 08:48.500
<i>Now, the number one hit</i>
<i>in the country. Vlad with "Fuck Boat."</i>

08:54.333 --> 08:57.041
Goddamn it. That shit slaps.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.666
Dobby, to prepare for your test,

09:00.750 --> 09:03.250
we're gonna teach you
all about American history.

09:05.375 --> 09:08.333
Son, America was discovered in 1492

09:08.416 --> 09:11.750
by a historic figure
named Christopher Cum-Bus.

09:13.083 --> 09:17.083
I'm gonna call this America.

09:17.166 --> 09:22.000
What a great discovery
for a jizz-filled bus.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.083
<i>Christopher Cum-Bus</i>
<i>became our first president,</i>

09:25.166 --> 09:26.375
<i>wrote the Ten Commandments,</i>

09:26.458 --> 09:30.166
<i>fought alongside General David E. Lee Roth</i>
<i>in the battle of Van Halen,</i>

09:30.250 --> 09:35.000
<i>and invented electricity, before he died</i>
<i>fighting the Dinobots on 9/11.</i>

09:35.083 --> 09:36.583
Never forget.

09:36.666 --> 09:39.625
That huffing gas is eating a lot of holes
in your daddy's brain.

09:41.708 --> 09:45.375
You didn't sell a single thing!

09:45.458 --> 09:48.416
You all suck
and are terrible at your jobs!

09:48.500 --> 09:49.458
Except for you.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.625
You keep smelling like that,
you'll be management soon.

09:55.250 --> 10:01.041
As for the rest of you, at Lovely Corp,
non-performance gets punished.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.708
HR said I can't do this to you,

10:04.791 --> 10:07.750
but I can make you
watch me do it to myself.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.958
This motherfucker is crazy.

10:12.041 --> 10:15.083
The lust for the one ring
made him this way.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.041
-What's that ringing?

10:19.125 --> 10:22.416
Oh, it's the old 911 line.
We just let it ring.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.666
Well, answer it!

10:23.750 --> 10:27.916
Oh, yeah, right. And do what? Go help 'em?
We didn't do that shit when we were cops.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.291
No! Go sell them crap!

10:31.375 --> 10:34.000
It's the perfect way
to get your foot in the door.

10:34.083 --> 10:38.750
If you need motivation, remember
what our first president once said.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.500
"I'm a bus full of jizz."

10:43.541 --> 10:46.500
Your first president? Christopher Cum-Bus?

10:46.583 --> 10:51.291
Hmm. Perhaps I shouldn't have paid a man
in a TITS hat for citizenship classes.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.791
Somebody call 911?

10:53.875 --> 10:56.500
My wife shot me.
I need to get to a hospital.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.125
I think what you need more

10:58.208 --> 11:01.625
is the Lovely Corp
Super-Sucker Wet-Dry Vac.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.541
Oh, look at it suck your little blood
right out the carpet.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.458
It's cleaning it up faster
than you're bleeding it out.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.708
Wow. My normal leading brand
vacuum cleaner can't do that.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.125
Act now and get
this brain splatter attachment,

11:14.208 --> 11:16.208
in case your wife
gets a headshot next time.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.208
I'd recommend that. I'm reloadin'!

11:19.958 --> 11:21.208
Dear God!

11:24.333 --> 11:25.250
Hold it right there!

11:26.583 --> 11:28.125
You don't wanna do this.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.416
With a regular, dull kitchen knife.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.250
Introducing the Lovely Ever-Sharp Knife.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.375
Buy now and get a free roll of happy tape.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.041
Isn't that better?

11:44.125 --> 11:47.000
Wow. I was looking
for something to take the edge off

11:47.083 --> 11:49.041
when I have sex with their dead bodies.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.291
Thanks, Lovely Corp.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.791
Submission is inevitable.

11:58.458 --> 12:03.166
That post on Nextdoor was true!
My dolphin queen has returned!

12:06.250 --> 12:10.333
Oh, yeah, baby. Let me rim that blowhole.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.791
Fitz, it's me, Kevin!

12:15.875 --> 12:18.708
I-I-I know. I-I-I'm very lonely.

12:18.791 --> 12:21.041
I'm sorry I tricked you,
but it's important.

12:21.125 --> 12:24.000
Lovely Corp is planning
something really terrible.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.000
I don't wanna hear you
shit-talking Lovely Corp.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.958
Thanks to them,
I could own a six-slice toaster.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.041
Then I'll be able
to fuck any dolphin I want.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.208
-Oh my God!

12:33.291 --> 12:34.291
Boat!

12:38.541 --> 12:40.416
Who's got the coolest boat now?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.708
My kegerator's powered by plutonium.

12:42.791 --> 12:44.708
You never had a beer this cold.

12:53.166 --> 12:57.083
Ha ha! I'm on a boat
in a boat. Double boat, bitch!

12:57.166 --> 13:01.291
That SS Cock Chugger
is looking a lot cooler now, baby.

13:04.416 --> 13:05.708
Oh yeah?

13:05.791 --> 13:10.458
Well, I apply sticker
of the Calvin making piss on your boat.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.583
Calvin would never do that!

13:18.666 --> 13:20.291
See? Not pissing.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.500
Look at all these points.
You're all neck and neck.

13:26.583 --> 13:27.958
Have you been up all night?

13:31.625 --> 13:33.041
Mine! Mine!

13:36.958 --> 13:40.250
Ooh! This is so hot!

13:40.333 --> 13:42.291
-Turns out I enjoy this.

13:42.375 --> 13:45.000
I need this toaster
to make my dreams come true.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.291
You're all mine. The four-slice toaster
just doesn't get the job done.

13:52.375 --> 13:55.125
See? I told you
I wouldn't die from an overdose.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.083
You win. Here's your five dollars.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.666
Damn. I didn't think this out.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.333
Ooh! Five dollars.

14:07.791 --> 14:09.500
I don't know why we wasted all that time

14:09.583 --> 14:11.833
trying to fill up that model
of Christopher Cum-Bus.

14:11.916 --> 14:14.750
Man, you told me
Dobby was a jizz-jual learner.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.208
I think you need hearing aids.

14:16.291 --> 14:19.583
Did you just say penis ass?
Why do you say shit like that?

14:19.666 --> 14:23.000
Anyway. We better finish the rest
of these subjects in a lightning round.

14:23.083 --> 14:23.916
Economics.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.291
Give me your goddamn wallet!

14:25.375 --> 14:26.833
Home Economics.

14:26.916 --> 14:29.000
Give me your goddamn wallet
and make me an omelet!

14:29.083 --> 14:30.458
Women's Studies.

14:33.375 --> 14:37.250
See, she's reclaiming her sexuality.
That's the third-wave feminism.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.708
Civics.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.375
And that's how you hotwire Honda Civics.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.791
Biology.

14:43.875 --> 14:44.750
Horse.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.750
Fat horse.

14:45.833 --> 14:46.833
Water horse.

14:46.916 --> 14:47.958
Pointy horse.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.375
Potassium horse.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.875
And last but not least, geography.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.250
This is the Earth.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.625
Wait a minute. That's the Earth?

14:54.708 --> 14:56.958
How the fuck can that be the Earth
when we on the Earth?

14:57.041 --> 14:58.125
Robby, this is just a--

14:58.208 --> 14:59.958
No, no, no. I understand science.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.833
Fuck you, tiny us!

15:07.416 --> 15:09.708
This is some party, baby.

15:10.583 --> 15:14.750
Hey. You're not Camaro the Bob.
He's Camaro the Bob.

15:15.458 --> 15:18.541
I'm starting to question everything, baby.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.375
Okay, you got me. Your boat <i>is</i> cooler.

15:23.458 --> 15:26.458
But my boat is faster!
I challenge you to a race.

15:26.541 --> 15:28.291
Winner gets the bikini girls.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.208
We choose to be okay
with being gambled off.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.666
Fourth-wave feminism. Mmm!

15:33.750 --> 15:35.125
You're on.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.041
Who the hell is this guy?

15:38.125 --> 15:39.250
Okay, you got me.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.333
A-pew-pew!

16:19.833 --> 16:20.750
I won!

16:22.750 --> 16:27.375
Oh shit! I guess it just ain't safe
to go from 200 to zero instantly.

16:27.958 --> 16:29.541
I called 911.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.375
They sold me this happy tape, baby.

16:33.625 --> 16:37.166
Them dead bodies look so happy,
I don't have to feel guilty.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.583
Thanks, Lovely Corp.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.541
There is nothing after death but darkness.

16:46.000 --> 16:46.958
Are you ready, son?

16:47.541 --> 16:50.458
You have four hours
to complete your sand-or-rice test.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.625
I told you.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.000
That's right.
I forgot we live in a cartoon.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.833
-Yeah!
-Huzzah.

17:06.916 --> 17:10.083
Your son is a genius.
Nobody's ever solved it that fast.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.916
Robby, turns out you were right
about that sand-or-rice test.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.958
I've never been right
about something before.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.291
I wonder what else I might be right about.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.000
Fuck you, tiny us!

17:21.083 --> 17:24.625
You've got one more chance
to let me in, or else!

17:24.708 --> 17:26.625
Or else what, peasant?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.166
No! Mine allergies!

17:40.083 --> 17:43.791
I, Zyrtec, have finally defeated you.
Zibble-bibble!

17:43.875 --> 17:47.000
Fuck you, Neil. Aren't you supposed
to be stocking at Target right now?

17:47.083 --> 17:50.958
No! They fired me
for masturbating! Zibble-bibble!

17:52.041 --> 17:54.000
You wanted to see me?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.083
Gotta impress the boss.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.083
Psst. Kevin.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.333
AFKAK. I thought you got banned from town.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.416
Yes. That's why
I'm dressed as this water horse.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.416
Listen. Lovely Corp is dangerous.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.125
Charles Lovely is planning something
called The Eternal Reckoning.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.458
I don't know exactly what it is,

18:13.541 --> 18:15.958
but I know it's bad,
and we have to stop him.

18:16.041 --> 18:19.125
Holy shit. I better go tell someone, then.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.125
AFKAK's in the bushes outside.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.791
Mr. Lovely wouldn't like that.

18:22.875 --> 18:27.833
All right. One million points
to the person who brings him to me!

18:30.083 --> 18:31.708
Hold on! Hold on!

18:31.791 --> 18:34.000
You are all pathetic.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.708
You can't sell out your friend
for a toaster.

18:37.791 --> 18:39.666
Because I'm doing it first, cock chuggers.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.375
Yeah, I heard that one earlier. I like it.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.500
Now, what kind of a sack
is that for a AFKAK?

18:48.583 --> 18:51.708
What you need is a Lovely Corp Nerd Net,

18:51.791 --> 18:56.583
made from breathable steel micromesh
so your nerds don't get all sweaty inside.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.541
Only 29.99.

18:58.625 --> 18:59.458
Sold!

19:02.583 --> 19:04.375
Man, these pockets is tight.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.041
Got a fat ass
and can't fit cash in your pockets?

19:07.125 --> 19:11.375
Looks like you need
a Lovely Corp Pocket Genie. Only 29.99.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.291
Sold!

19:14.125 --> 19:16.291
Aw. Now I ain't got no money.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.833
What am I supposed
to do with this pocket genie?

19:18.916 --> 19:21.083
Oh. I know.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.958
Why are you doing this?!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.750
For a six-slice toaster.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.791
They're, like, 50 bucks!

19:31.875 --> 19:33.958
I'll buy you all one right now!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.750
He's lying. This is a seven-slice toaster.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.875
He's trying to make us choose
between wasting bread or electricity.

19:39.958 --> 19:40.791
Kill him!

19:45.041 --> 19:47.375
We've been searching high and low.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.333
Yeah, I've been looking
everywhere for you, AFKAK.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.583
Uh-huh, the only man, the one and only man

19:53.666 --> 19:56.833
who hates Lovely Corp
as much as we do, yeah.

19:56.916 --> 20:00.416
Hate is a strong word,
but it's perfect when you mean it.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.791
Now, welcome to the resistance. Oh yeah.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.125
Who is that guy?

20:13.208 --> 20:15.333
He's just here to wear me.

20:15.416 --> 20:19.125
See, there was a problem reversing
the experimental procedure at the FBI.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.833
Wait a minute.
They let you back into the FBI?

20:21.916 --> 20:25.750
Why is that everyone's first question?
I'm pants, goddamn it!

20:29.000 --> 20:32.083
Everyone, it looks like our point leader

20:32.166 --> 20:36.791
and new owner
of his very own six-slice toaster

20:36.875 --> 20:38.750
is Gerald Fitz.

20:38.833 --> 20:40.458
I've caught AFKAK.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.291
What the fuck is this?

20:44.375 --> 20:45.708
That's Tilda Swinton.

20:45.791 --> 20:48.041
We have a new winner!

20:48.791 --> 20:50.000
I didn't even want this.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.666
Remember that toast joke I told?
Next time, laugh.
