<i> It's Marlon with the</i>
<i> American Cornhole League.</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:05.270
- They invited BDS
to the championships

00:05.339 --> 00:06.638
in South Carolina.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.873
- Can I have the roster

00:07.942 --> 00:09.408
of the [bleep] [bleep] that are
coming?

00:09.477 --> 00:10.976
'Cause I want to [bleep]
sabotage these people.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.278
- Talking trash with the
enemy--it's a distraction.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.247
You're DM'ing the whole ACL.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.348
- But I'm helping
you out, though.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.251
- No one told her
to DM the whole ACL.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.120
You're embarrassing me.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.722
[laughter]

00:23.791 --> 00:25.391
- Vinny, just please
make out with her.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.060
- I would date Vinny
full-blown.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.128
- Wow.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.663
- Do some marshmallows.
Where did Angeliners go?

01:04.732 --> 01:05.798
- Do you like him?

01:05.866 --> 01:09.568
- If Vinny was
full-blown all-in,

01:09.637 --> 01:12.371
I would date Vinny full-blown.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.206
- Wow.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.707
I am speechless.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.209
- Yo, look at that, man.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.111
- He made fire.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.046
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.414
- Get some sleep.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.450
<i> Angelina confided in me</i>
<i> in the confessional</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:26.885
that she has a crush
on Vinny,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.420
<i> and I'm here for it.</i>

01:28.489 --> 01:29.855
I love you guys.
I'm going to bed.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.356
- I love you.
Good night.

01:31.425 --> 01:35.527
- But I think Angelina is
just hard in the friend zone.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.962
- Want me to open it?

01:37.031 --> 01:39.164
- Angelina, you don't
have to serve me.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.767
- I'll just do it for you.
What the [bleep]?

01:41.836 --> 01:43.802
- Earlier, Angelina was
giving Vinny a lap dance.

01:43.871 --> 01:44.803
- [grunts]

01:44.872 --> 01:46.004
- Oh, my God.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.974
- Want me to put
my ass in your face?

01:49.043 --> 01:51.510
- And then Angelina pulled me
aside to ask about Vinny.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.712
- What do I do...

01:53.781 --> 01:56.715
to make him not think,
like, I'm a joke?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.217
- Um...

01:58.285 --> 01:59.318
Awkward.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.120
- Pauly, truth or dare?
- Truth.

02:01.188 --> 02:04.156
- Do you see yourself
having a baby with Nikki?

02:04.225 --> 02:06.158
- Ooh.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.894
- That's a good one.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.762
- Maybe.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.231
- She's got to get off
that birth control.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.134
- It's a lot.
[laughter]

02:15.202 --> 02:17.936
- Nicole, truth or dare?
- Truth.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.138
No, dare.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.874
- I dare you to get
motorboated by Angelina.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.042
- Yes.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.577
- Come on, bitch.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.112
I feel like
I never turn down a dare

02:27.181 --> 02:28.247
unless it's, like, crazy.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.915
- You got to go like the--
- Go.

02:29.984 --> 02:30.949
- You know we've done this
before.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.050
- Do it.
- Oh, my goodness.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.152
- You got to motorboat her.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.319
- You have to motorboat me.
- Oh.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.155
- No, no, no!
- No!

02:36.223 --> 02:38.223
- What?
- You got to motorboat her.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.125
- I was gonna say that.
- Here, do it to me.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.760
No!

02:41.829 --> 02:44.596
To my boobies or her boobies?
- Her boobies, your face.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.332
- Oh, you asshole.
Let's go.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.868
[spluttering]
[laughter]

02:52.473 --> 02:53.872
- It was the sound effects
for me.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.274
- Oh, my God.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.742
[laughter]

02:56.810 --> 02:59.878
- I'm gonna pee.
I'm gonna pee myself.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.213
- That was good.
- That was fun.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.415
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.852
- Is the guy, Vinny,
your boyfriend?

03:06.921 --> 03:09.755
- Hi, are you in my garage?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.190
- Wait, time-out!

03:11.258 --> 03:14.526
She's FaceTiming a guy
at her house in the garage.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.094
- No.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.297
No.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.965
<i> Vinny is prying</i>
<i> in my love life,</i>

03:20.034 --> 03:22.401
which is very flattering,
and it's cute.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.402
He likes me.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.736
Why do you care?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.772
- 'Cause we're playing
Truth or Dare?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.407
- It's a game.
- Okay.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.276
Truth or dare. Go.
- Truth.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.345
- So...

03:33.414 --> 03:35.547
what's your boundaries?

03:35.616 --> 03:37.549
- That's a broad question.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.819
- I don't think Angelina knows
how to play Truth or Dare.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.322
- Does that make sense to you?
- What do you want me to do?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.890
- Be more specific.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.793
- Angelina doesn't even know
what planet she's on right now.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.661
- Can I--
all right, go.

03:51.932 --> 03:55.000
- It's the day before the
Cornhole World Championships.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.268
<i> We're gonna light</i>
<i> some candles,</i>

03:56.337 --> 03:58.937
<i> and we're going</i>
<i> to envision victory.</i>

03:59.006 --> 04:00.839
This is what I like
to call manifestation.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.741
I am blessed.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.843
I am healthy.
I am strong.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.180
I need to sort of focus
and sort of de-stress

04:08.249 --> 04:10.215
and get in my zone.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.418
Ohm.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.191
- Angelina, truth or dare?
- Dare.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.027
- I dare you to give
Vinny a kiss on the cheek.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.463
- On the lips.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.431
Oh, my God.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.499
Lips.
- She said "cheek."

04:27.568 --> 04:28.767
- Lips.
We're adults here.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.936
- I said "lips."
- We're all adults here.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.504
- Guys, stop making it weird.
- All right.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.273
- Lips.
- Lips or cheek?

04:34.341 --> 04:35.540
Go.
- Lips, we're adults.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.575

Fine.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.609
- Lips.
Fine, lips.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.111

- Stop.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.553
Why do you have
to be violent?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.988
- I didn't touch you.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.957
All right, cheek.
- Yep.

04:52.026 --> 04:54.226
- The lips.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.667
- So cute.
- You smell like wine.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.101
- I'm drinking wine.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.171
- I dare you to drop it hot
like you wanted to

05:06.240 --> 05:08.173
on Vinny real quick.
- Mm.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.042
- Here's your second chance
to be sexy.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.110
<i> Her lap dance sucked.</i>

05:12.179 --> 05:13.245
- My God.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.080
Now, that's
how you get pink eye.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.182
- Girl, I know
you can do better.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.583

05:18.652 --> 05:21.687
- Oh, you're stepping
on my [bleep], bro.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.122
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Ow, Angeline--

05:24.191 --> 05:25.290
- Drop it like it's hot.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.658
- Drop it like it's hot.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.860
- Angelina stepped
on my [bleep] again.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.529
Oh!
- Not drop it like it's a fart.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.698
- Literally stepping
on my balls.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.266
- Do you know what
"drop it like it's hot" means?

05:34.335 --> 05:36.835
Just go, boom.
- Are you guys assholes?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.003
I know what the [bleep] it is.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.940

05:42.009 --> 05:43.709

<i> - Angelina is not good</i>
<i> at dropping it like it's hot.</i>

05:52.486 --> 05:54.653
I am holding

- [laughing] That's his hand.
- Like it's hot.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.257
- He's [bleep].
- Whoa, stop.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.792
- Look it,
she's doing the reverse.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.094
- But why does she
have to [bleep]...

06:02.162 --> 06:03.795
- No, she's not
being aggressive.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.797
- Physically assault first.
- I'm not beating him up.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.199
- That's her love language.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.734
- All right, I won't step
on your [bleep], I promise.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.335
- I have no protection.
- All right, ready?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.070
- Don't put your [bleep] ass

06:12.139 --> 06:13.538
<i> - She's standing up on him</i>

06:13.607 --> 06:16.074

- All right, we're nervous.
- There you go.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.311
- Make out.
- What are you doing?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.079
- I'm just sitting on you.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.882
- And does nothing--
craziest thing.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.552
- All right, if I put a [bleep]
marshmallow in your mouth,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.688
would you care?
- Yes.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.323
- Why?
- 'Cause it's sugar, man.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.724
- Oh.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.594
- Bitch, you're [bleep] weird.

06:35.662 --> 06:36.928
- Nicole.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.030
- I understand, but I--

06:39.099 --> 06:40.332
let's just--

06:40.401 --> 06:41.700
- I'm going to bed.
Good night, guys.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.001
- No.
- Good night.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.970
- We're all having fun.
- We're not, though.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.438
- No, we are.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.207
- I'm like the emoji
where your mind blows.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.575
What just happened?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.644
- I don't care, Nicole.
I don't give a [bleep].

06:52.713 --> 06:54.780
How about that?
I don't give a [bleep].

06:54.848 --> 06:56.081
- Angelina went through,

06:56.150 --> 06:58.450
like, an entire toxic
relationship tonight.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.385
- Yes.
She fed you ice cream.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.521
- [speaking Italian]

07:02.589 --> 07:04.122
[laughter]

07:04.191 --> 07:05.257
- I got a lap dance.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.359
- Oh, my God.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.494
She went full frontal.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.296
Second lap dance.
- She beat me up.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.766
Oh, you're stepping
on my [bleep], bro.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.501
- No, that's not what I meant.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.936
- She had a fight with herself.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.071
- [muffled] Come on.
This is so stupid.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.773
- Mm-hmm.
- And then she...

07:21.842 --> 07:23.842
- Stormed off
and beefed with Nicole.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.410
- She's crazy.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.546
- You're just as crazy as me.
Stop talking [bleep] about me.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.449
- I am,
but you're going wild now.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.516
- Good night.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.684
- I am nice.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.785
I'm the nicest person
in the house.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.053
- I said good night.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.588
I didn't say that.
I said good night.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.689
- Okay.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.324
- [bleep] out of here.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.259
- She's toxic as [bleep].

07:44.431 --> 07:47.532
- Are you ready?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.601
- BDS is
a professional athlete.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.603
<i> I'm in the locker room.</i>
<i> It's happening.</i>

07:51.672 --> 07:53.171
- Do you know where he is?
- You know where Mike is?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.506
- I mean, listen,
if you're feeling good,

07:54.575 --> 07:55.740
you're looking good.
And if you're looking good,

07:55.809 --> 07:56.741
you're getting good results.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.043
- That's Jay Cutler.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.214
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.815
Did he wave back?
- No.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.317
- Did he see you wave?
- Yes.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.252
[laughter]

08:12.159 --> 08:13.758
- Good night, guys.
- No.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.894
- Good night
Good night, bitches.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.929
- Tonight was a...

08:17.998 --> 08:19.764
interesting night
at the strip club.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.999
- The thing that's funny
is she talked

08:21.068 --> 08:22.300
herself out of the lap dance.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.668
Like, it was all--
you said, yes, let's do it.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.769
- Yeah, let's do it.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.071
You know, I'm trying
to play along.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.306
I am single,
trying to be friendly.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.941
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.944
- But Angelina--
there's a lot of friction.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.913
It's very tense.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.182
- Come on, bitch.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.050
Angelina.
<i> - No.</i>

08:39.119 --> 08:41.353
- Can we not be four?

08:41.455 --> 08:42.654
- I'm naked.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.289
See me?

08:44.358 --> 08:47.225
Look at my ass.
- Okay, get some clothes on.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.061
Everything that's happening
right now is [bleep] bizarre.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.531
You're a very stressful
meatball, I'll say that.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.500
I feel like Angelina really
wants to be with Vinny,

08:55.569 --> 08:57.068
<i> and, like, you know,</i>
<i> have sex with him,</i>

08:57.137 --> 08:58.503
but she's ruining everything.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.938
- It's not about you.
You understand that, right?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.973
- I know.
- It's about Vinny.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.341
'Cause, like--
- He was willing

09:03.443 --> 09:05.176
to take your lap dance twice.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.912
- Who the [bleep] is he?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.313
"Take my lap dance."

09:08.382 --> 09:10.382
- We were playing
Truth or Dare, you [bleep].

09:10.484 --> 09:12.584
- [spluttering]

09:12.653 --> 09:13.818
Don't sign up for it, then.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.754
- I'm sorry, but you
sound [bleep] stupid.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.489
- What was that, dude?
- [exhales deeply]

09:17.558 --> 09:18.590
I don't even know.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.925
I'm sore.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.560
I feel like
I've been manhandled

09:21.628 --> 09:22.928
by a [bleep] grizzly bear.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.329
- It was a roller coaster.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.931
- I don't understand
why you're so upset.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.099
- It's been like this
for a long time, Nicole.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.668
It has nothing to do
with right now.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.470
It's been a thing between us.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.406
- You [bleep] like him.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.575
- I would like for him
to be nice to me.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.109
- You like him,
and you're hurt.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.311
- I will always like him.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.279
<i> - Holy [bleep], this is huge,</i>

09:41.348 --> 09:43.148
<i> 'cause she</i>
<i> actually likes Vinny.</i>

09:43.216 --> 09:44.849
See?
It's true.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.952
You wouldn't be
so dramatic and upset

09:47.020 --> 09:49.521
if you didn't really like him.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.623
- I almost feel like--
- You like him.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.891
Just say it.
You like Vinny.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.626
- I've known Vinny
for a long time.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.028
I've always liked
him like that.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.030
- But, yo, she pulled me aside.
- What'd she say?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.098
- And that's
when you walked in.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.666
It was all awkward.
- Oh, yeah.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.834
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

10:02.903 --> 10:03.835
- Yeah.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.971
- What do I do...

10:06.039 --> 10:08.873
to make him not think,
like, I'm a joke?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.241
- Um...

10:10.310 --> 10:11.476
- Like, we're just,
like, friends,

10:11.545 --> 10:13.144
and, like, I'm down
to have fun and all that.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.446
- Yeah.
- She's obviously crazy,

10:14.548 --> 10:17.382
out of her mind,
so it's hard not

10:17.451 --> 10:19.417
to make jokes about...
- Yeah.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.219
- Her kneeing me
in the balls and [bleep].

10:21.288 --> 10:22.654
You know what I mean?

10:22.723 --> 10:23.788
- I do think
she overthinks it, though.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.223
Just chill.
Just have fun, whatever.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.093
- Her personality is just,
like, very abrasive.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.395
Oh, you're stepping
on my [bleep].

10:30.464 --> 10:32.163
But if Angelina ever,
like, you know,

10:32.232 --> 10:34.232
kind of, like,
softened up a little bit,

10:34.301 --> 10:35.467
anything is possible.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.968
- If that happens
down the line, it happens.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.470
You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, you know.

10:38.538 --> 10:39.971
If that ever happens one day...
- 400 bottles of tequila--

10:40.040 --> 10:42.207
I mean, whatever.
- That could happen one day.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.975
- I think tomorrow morning--
I got to tell you right now.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.910
After this, I think
I'm gonna go rogue.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.579
- No, you can't go rogue
tomorrow.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.980
We are cheerleading
for Mike tomorrow.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.281
- After that.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.916
- Oh, after that,
do your [bleep] thing.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.885
Go get arrested.
I don't care.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.221
But for tomorrow,
we're cheering for Mike.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.622
And the fact
that Deena's not here

10:57.691 --> 10:59.624
and she's the only one
that does the cheers with me,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.726
you have to step up.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.294
Can we go over the cheers?
- Okay.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.597
- I'm down a meatball.
Jenni hates cheering.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.966
So, Angelina, I need you.

but that's his problem
that he won't do it.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.449

saw the sexy side of you,

have a sexy body.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.219

You've changed.

You're not a baby anymore.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.896
