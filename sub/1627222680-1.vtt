WEBVTT

00:05.768 --> 00:09.268
- [Alex] Abdicate.

00:09.268 --> 00:13.200
Abdicate.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.140
I'll use it in a sentence.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.720
Geraldine is abdicating her responsibility

00:17.720 --> 00:21.163
to study for her SATs which are in a week.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.453
- To neglect or abandon
a responsibility or duty.

00:26.390 --> 00:29.030
- Or?
- To renounce one's throne,

00:29.030 --> 00:31.530
for instance, despite the
urgings of other members

00:31.530 --> 00:33.650
of the royal family,
General Douglas MacArthur

00:33.650 --> 00:36.980
pressed Emperor Hirohito
to refrain from abdicating

00:36.980 --> 00:39.630
the Japanese throne in the
aftermath of World War II.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.523
- Showoff.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.880
- How many more of these
do we have to do today?

00:44.880 --> 00:45.810
- Why?

00:45.810 --> 00:48.513
Practicing SAT words with
your cousin isn't exciting?

00:49.510 --> 00:51.100
- No, I'm just tired.

00:51.100 --> 00:56.100
- Fair enough, since you got
the last 65 questions right,

00:56.430 --> 01:01.223
I guess I can let you
go after this last one.

01:02.071 --> 01:02.904
Disencumber.

01:02.904 --> 01:04.620
- To free oneself of an encumbrance.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.550
- And what's-
- An encumbrance is a burden,

01:09.550 --> 01:10.820
an albatross, an obligation.

01:10.820 --> 01:11.940
For example, you might think

01:11.940 --> 01:14.100
that the end of this tutoring
session disencumbers me

01:14.100 --> 01:15.710
from everything that I have to do tonight.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.020
However, little do you know

01:17.020 --> 01:19.650
that now I've got to
go to soccer practice.

01:19.650 --> 01:20.600
- [Alex] The test's in a week.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.340
Your folks are still making you play?

01:22.340 --> 01:24.360
- Yep, hedging their...

01:24.360 --> 01:27.783
My bets. Got to get recruited, too.

01:28.785 --> 01:30.780
- I forgot how insane
college admissions is.

01:30.780 --> 01:34.510
- Can't be too bad compared
to grad school. Speaking of.

01:34.510 --> 01:35.950
- I find out in...

01:37.860 --> 01:40.670
23 minutes.
- Good luck.

01:40.670 --> 01:41.503
- Hopefully.

01:42.390 --> 01:45.550
Then I'll never have to tutor
another high schooler again.

01:45.550 --> 01:47.240
- Tutoring us isn't exciting?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.880
- You see, the thing
with college students is

01:48.880 --> 01:50.963
they actually choose to be there,

01:51.840 --> 01:53.800
so it's a bit less like pulling teeth.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.301
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:55.301 --> 01:56.530
This is exactly what I want to be doing

01:56.530 --> 01:58.050
after eight hours of school

01:58.050 --> 02:01.590
and before two hours of
getting kicked in the shins.

02:01.590 --> 02:04.540
- Go play video games or snort some glue

02:04.540 --> 02:06.180
or whatever teenagers do.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.300
- Seriously? You're, like, 24.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.470
- 25. I'm geriatric.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.377
- Okay.
- Don't you have to get going?

02:13.377 --> 02:15.703
- Yes, yes. Good luck.
- Thank you.

03:21.519 --> 03:24.436
(optimistic music)

03:53.762 --> 03:56.345
(Darren sighs)

03:58.946 --> 04:02.196
(Darren clears throat)

04:06.450 --> 04:07.800
- Good evening, Mr. Tanaka.

04:09.380 --> 04:10.880
You too, a pleasure as always.

04:14.660 --> 04:15.493
Uh-huh.

04:21.910 --> 04:23.840
Uh-huh, wait, wait, no no no, Mr. Tanaka,

04:23.840 --> 04:24.790
you have to understand

04:24.790 --> 04:26.740
that great films require great capital.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.500
Okay, look, I can guarantee you 15 1/2.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.530
You know what, 17 1/2 percent.

04:37.829 --> 04:41.550
Okay, but we've been talking
about this for months.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.620
I understand, yeah.

04:54.150 --> 04:57.490
Look, Mr. Tanaka, you
are making a big mistake

04:57.490 --> 04:59.990
and passing up on one hell
of an opportunity here.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.253
I know you'll reconsider.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.940
My regards to you as well, sir.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.713
- Shit, man, I'm sorry.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.550
- It's fine, it's fine, honestly.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.040
I've got plenty of other
investors lined up,

05:23.040 --> 05:25.380
so if the guy can't appreciate
my vision, fuck him, right?

05:25.380 --> 05:26.213
Fuck him.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.330
Wait, today's the 14th, right?

05:35.910 --> 05:36.743
- Yeah.

05:38.010 --> 05:41.340
- Oh, shit. And...

05:43.360 --> 05:44.193
- I got in.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.810
Sorry about the phone call.
- Dude, dude dude dude dude!

05:48.810 --> 05:51.340
I'm so happy for you, that's amazing.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.383
I mean, now we have something
to celebrate, right?

05:54.339 --> 05:56.710
Come on, let's not fucking sulk, come on.

05:56.710 --> 05:58.833
Seriously, seriously, come on.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.070
No, it's a big deal. It's a big deal.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.450
You're taking a big step here, right?

06:05.450 --> 06:06.800
I'm proud of you, honestly.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.640
- I mean, it's a big decision.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.250
The next five years of my life-

06:13.250 --> 06:15.430
- Shut up, shut up. It's awesome.

06:15.430 --> 06:17.193
It's awesome, that's what it is.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.721
Now, let's do some fucking drugs, right?

06:20.721 --> 06:23.804
(upbeat dance music)

06:50.999 --> 06:53.749
(shower running)

07:01.176 --> 07:03.926
(birds tweeting)

07:23.343 --> 07:25.760
(Alex sighs)

07:34.984 --> 07:37.817
(water splashing)

07:54.807 --> 07:56.720
Good morning, Mr. Howard.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.250
Yesterday I spoke to Mr.
Tanaka and he informed me

07:59.250 --> 08:00.600
that he was unable to meet

08:00.600 --> 08:03.940
his financial obligations as a producer,

08:03.940 --> 08:08.791
so I am prepared to offer you-
- Yes, mom, I'll find out

08:08.791 --> 08:10.002
about financial aid later this week.

08:10.002 --> 08:11.552
- An extraordinary opportunity.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.350
- So what if I got things
in a couple weeks late?

08:15.350 --> 08:19.950
It's not gonna be a huge deal.
They have a huge endowment.

08:19.950 --> 08:22.700
- But Mr. Howard, this is an
opportunity of a lifetime.

08:30.220 --> 08:33.623
I regret that you feel this
way. I know you'll reconsider.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.573
- Yes, I love you too.

08:52.713 --> 08:53.546
Bye.

09:13.830 --> 09:16.413
(door opening)

09:34.610 --> 09:37.620
- Uh, catching up on required reading?

09:37.620 --> 09:38.453
- Trying to.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.750
- Oh yeah, I think I know, um,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.760
about three words on that page.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.080
- Yeah, if I know 10 of
them by the time I'm done

09:47.080 --> 09:49.960
with my Phd, that'll
be 10 new words for me.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.990
- Ah, 10 words for $250,000.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.210
What does that come to, $25,000 per word?

09:56.210 --> 09:58.943
Wow, expensive words.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.560
Yeah, that's nice, that's good, keep it.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.823
Hold that, hold that.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.033
Hold it, hold it.

10:09.070 --> 10:10.863
Cut, shit. Cut.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.023
Hello?

10:20.330 --> 10:21.940
What, um...

10:21.940 --> 10:24.890
No, it's Saturday. No, you said I...

10:25.730 --> 10:28.197
You said I didn't have to
work this Saturday, so.

10:28.197 --> 10:30.697
(tense music)

10:50.820 --> 10:52.930
You're tying your tie wrong.

10:52.930 --> 10:55.630
Your belt and shoes clearly don't match.

10:55.630 --> 10:58.093
When was the last time that
you dressed up like this?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.800
- [Alex] Your grandfather's funeral.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.560
- Damn, that was like
freshman year of college.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.393
- Shit.

11:07.540 --> 11:10.810
I'm going to this alumni networking event.

11:10.810 --> 11:12.510
Do you want to come?

11:12.510 --> 11:13.343
- Gross.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.003
The only people that are there

11:16.003 --> 11:18.950
want to give life advice
or get life advice.

11:18.950 --> 11:21.350
You're already going to grad
school, why do you want to go?

11:21.350 --> 11:22.250
- It's free booze.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.113
- Tempting.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.523
Here, let me fix it.
- No!

11:30.523 --> 11:31.870
- Come on, stop, stop, stop.

11:49.686 --> 11:51.436
- Well, you're early.

11:52.330 --> 11:56.040
Things aren't gonna get hopping
here for another half hour.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.730
- Sorry, I didn't have
anywhere else to be.

11:57.730 --> 12:00.820
- It's all right. What,
you get out of work early?

12:00.820 --> 12:03.600
- I don't work.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.020
- No? What do you do?

12:06.020 --> 12:07.442
- I'm going to grad school.

12:07.442 --> 12:09.483
- (gasps) You gonna get an MBA?

12:10.870 --> 12:11.703
What, a JD?

12:11.703 --> 12:13.840
- [Alex] A PhD in literature.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.480
- Ooh, you're gonna be a writer.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.760
- [Alex] Well, I'm going to be teaching

12:17.760 --> 12:20.329
the promising minds of
the next generation.

12:20.329 --> 12:21.220
- Uh-huh.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.180
- [Alex] Keeping the dying
art of literature alive.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.235
- Uh-huh.

12:24.235 --> 12:25.068
- [Alex] You know, we live in a world

12:25.068 --> 12:28.370
that's so over-inundated with
all this mediocre content

12:28.370 --> 12:30.710
designed for a generation
with attention spans

12:30.710 --> 12:33.320
really only of about five seconds.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.130
- There's gonna be plenty of
people for you to network with

12:36.130 --> 12:37.610
any minute now.

12:37.610 --> 12:39.510
Right now, why don't you have a drink?

12:40.830 --> 12:42.323
Go on, it's good for you.

13:10.437 --> 13:13.437
(crickets chirping)

13:25.832 --> 13:27.082
- Um, so I, um.

13:29.410 --> 13:34.040
I am a little tight on cash at the moment.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.390
I was wondering

13:36.770 --> 13:37.790
if you

13:40.610 --> 13:42.583
might be able to,

13:44.780 --> 13:47.423
you know, um... (laughs)

13:54.609 --> 13:56.423
Um.
- If I could spot you?

13:57.500 --> 14:02.500
- Yeah, yeah, if I could dip
a little bit into Darren debt.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.310
- You mean deeper into Darren debt.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.380
What if I were to say no?

14:13.450 --> 14:16.340
- I'm gonna get cash later
this week from my mom.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.283
- From your mommy.

14:23.470 --> 14:25.887
(Alex sighs)

14:44.198 --> 14:46.865
(bag crinkling)

14:53.848 --> 14:56.515
(door knocking)

15:12.408 --> 15:15.158
(relaxing music)

15:21.566 --> 15:22.399
- Got it.

15:25.830 --> 15:27.883
- [Kyle] Hey, eyes over there, guys.

15:32.527 --> 15:35.194
(safe clicking)

15:43.540 --> 15:46.240
Well, now that business is concluded,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.163
I believe that congrats are in order.

15:49.050 --> 15:50.980
- He filled out an application.

15:50.980 --> 15:54.120
- Yeah, but it's not like
they accept everyone.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.550
- [Darren] I'm sure a pulse is required.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.610
- Well, you know, it's actually

15:57.610 --> 16:00.530
some really very high level
stuff, you know, I don't know

16:00.530 --> 16:03.289
if you guys would quite
meet the qualifications.

16:03.289 --> 16:04.122
- And why?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.843
'Cause I deal drugs?

16:08.133 --> 16:08.983
- And I'm a suit?

16:14.180 --> 16:16.340
- I didn't mean to...

16:20.850 --> 16:23.600
No, you-
- I'm fucking with you, man.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.457
It's not like that, I'm fine.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.320
Well, that book-ology degree

16:28.320 --> 16:30.890
has got to be mad expensive, right?

16:30.890 --> 16:35.233
- Yeah, well, a couple
alums endowed a scholarship.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.720
I mean literally, like,
$20 million in donations.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.553
- Donations.

16:41.650 --> 16:43.523
You subsist on goodwill, Alex.

16:44.830 --> 16:48.303
- Better than bad will, am I right?

16:50.090 --> 16:51.840
- Some of us work for what we have.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.003
- Some of us.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.573
- You subsist off of my donations, right?

16:59.650 --> 17:02.803
I mean, in theory, I could
just steal your weed and leave.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.370
What would you do, call the cops?

17:11.565 --> 17:15.982
- You wouldn't do that. I'd
stop donating drugs, man.

17:17.350 --> 17:18.573
Now, who wants to smoke?

17:26.261 --> 17:29.261
(crickets chirping)

17:38.237 --> 17:40.062
- That was fun.

17:40.062 --> 17:41.012
- The weed was fun.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.130
- Kyle's a fun guy.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.433
- Kyle's a source of weed and weed is fun.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.780
- You know, maybe you'd
have a little more fun

17:51.780 --> 17:53.350
if you weren't such a dick to him.

17:53.350 --> 17:54.343
- He's a fuck up.

18:06.220 --> 18:10.810
- I feel like shit, okay? Is
that what you want me to say?

18:10.810 --> 18:13.020
I feel like shit about the whole

18:13.020 --> 18:15.363
accidentally making you spotting me thing.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.003
- It's not a thing. It's not an accident.

18:22.540 --> 18:23.940
You just fucking stiffed me.

18:25.150 --> 18:27.860
- I'll pay you back. It's like 40 bucks.

18:27.860 --> 18:28.980
Don't you make that in an hour?

18:28.980 --> 18:32.080
- I make that in 45 minutes,
but it's about the principle.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.010
- The principle.
- Yeah.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.530
Do you know what's fun? 14 hour work days.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.453
- Okay, I get it, I get it.

18:42.563 --> 18:44.894
(stammering) I fucked up.

18:44.894 --> 18:47.500
- (stammering mockingly) You did, yeah.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.390
I work to make money.

18:49.390 --> 18:52.860
I save to make films,
so paying for your drugs

18:52.860 --> 18:55.340
means I have less money to make films.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.430
- I told you, I will pay you back.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.860
- It's not about that.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.010
- Then what's it about?

19:06.180 --> 19:09.740
- You get to pursue your
educational aspirations.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.130
You don't even want to cure cancer,

19:11.130 --> 19:14.430
you want to lord over young
minds from some ivory tower

19:14.430 --> 19:16.190
and watch them suffer
through student loans

19:16.190 --> 19:18.840
while you get to slither on
through the tenure track.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.980
(Alex scoffs)

19:22.980 --> 19:26.763
- That's minimizing it.
- No, no, it's not.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.190
You literally want to get paid to read.

19:30.190 --> 19:32.610
Kyle gets to chill and smoke all day,

19:32.610 --> 19:33.700
even though the guy's got to be old enough

19:33.700 --> 19:35.070
to have three fucking kids.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.587
If I had a tenth of the
opportunities that you had-

19:36.587 --> 19:39.070
- Oh, no no no, do not
pull that shit on me, man.

19:39.070 --> 19:40.370
No way, mm-mm, no.

19:40.370 --> 19:43.040
I begged my ass off for those
scholarships, you know that,

19:43.040 --> 19:44.950
and it's not like I live
in a fucking castle.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.920
- Yeah, but you have had opportunities.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.060
You have had a future shoved
down your goddamn throat

19:49.060 --> 19:50.670
by a fucking family that supports you,

19:50.670 --> 19:53.120
and that is way more than
anything I've ever had.

19:54.010 --> 19:57.440
- So you resent the fact that
I didn't grow up in a trailer?

19:57.440 --> 20:00.630
- No, I resent the fact
that if I had what you had,

20:00.630 --> 20:03.393
I would have already
made five fucking films.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.943
- Well, you've got the
savings. What's stopping you?

20:25.800 --> 20:27.198
Look, I obviously didn't-

20:27.198 --> 20:30.115
(Darren screaming)

20:40.200 --> 20:41.033
- Why does it just seem

20:41.033 --> 20:43.180
like everyone gets
whatever they want but me?

20:51.260 --> 20:52.710
- What do you want me to say?

20:56.900 --> 20:57.733
- Nothing.

21:01.050 --> 21:02.177
Just learn to listen.

21:11.466 --> 21:14.133
(door clunking)

21:21.557 --> 21:24.140
(door opening)

21:29.950 --> 21:32.617
(keys jingling)

22:02.191 --> 22:05.774
(Darren breathing heavily)

22:39.743 --> 22:42.493
(birds tweeting)

22:56.200 --> 22:57.033
You know I didn't mean any of it.

22:57.033 --> 22:59.263
- Yeah, I know, you were just frustrated.

23:01.070 --> 23:04.463
I could stand to learn how to
read the room once in a while.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.833
- Shit. Thanks, man.

23:15.958 --> 23:19.541
(door opening and closing)

23:34.587 --> 23:37.254
(phone ringing)

23:43.120 --> 23:45.900
- [Janice] Hi, Alex, this is Janice Brown,

23:45.900 --> 23:47.590
acting assistant junior dean

23:47.590 --> 23:49.403
for admissions and financial aid.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.793
I wanted to extend my sincerest
congratulations to you.

23:59.210 --> 24:02.270
Well, unfortunately we cannot
offer you financial aid

24:02.270 --> 24:03.650
at this juncture.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.440
You are more than welcome
to appeal this decision

24:06.440 --> 24:09.623
as per the processes
listed on our website.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.823
Alex, are you still there?

24:17.280 --> 24:18.783
- Yes, hello, yes.

24:19.620 --> 24:20.453
Sorry.

24:22.203 --> 24:23.853
I'm just a little bit shocked.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.753
Tuition is a huge expense
for me and my family.

24:27.753 --> 24:29.470
- [Janice] Tuition is a huge investment

24:29.470 --> 24:30.960
for all of our students.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.310
I regret to inform you that
several important documents

24:34.310 --> 24:36.000
were not submitted in a timely manner.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.587
- Yes, but what about the-

24:37.587 --> 24:39.987
- Our Witzelberg Kennedy
fund has been depleted.

24:45.290 --> 24:47.020
Well, congratulations again,

24:47.020 --> 24:49.320
and we look forward to
seeing you in the fall.

25:01.028 --> 25:03.778
(pages flipping)

25:14.940 --> 25:15.990
- You all right, man?

25:17.550 --> 25:18.690
I threw in a bit extra for you there.

25:18.690 --> 25:19.840
I figure you needed it.

25:21.490 --> 25:24.100
- Thanks. I could use it.

25:24.100 --> 25:24.933
- Yeah, man.

25:25.990 --> 25:30.160
Listen, don't let this scholarship
thing get you too down.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.760
- I almost wish I didn't get in.

25:33.012 --> 25:34.400
- Yeah, but you did,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.050
and that's something in
and of itself, right?

25:37.050 --> 25:40.930
- It's them saying, we like
you, but not that much.

25:40.930 --> 25:44.060
It's like your parents telling you

25:44.060 --> 25:45.790
you're their second favorite child,

25:45.790 --> 25:49.783
or finding out you're like
a third string boyfriend.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.360
I should really just
focus on something else

25:53.360 --> 25:56.583
and get my mind off of it.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.483
God, I'm such a little bitch.

26:12.413 --> 26:14.413
- [Kyle] Check this out.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.400
- U Chicago Law?

26:26.400 --> 26:28.523
- [Kyle] It's the fourth
best in the country.

26:31.110 --> 26:34.550
- So why do you deal? If
you don't mind me asking.

26:34.550 --> 26:35.820
- [Kyle] I object to the question.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.933
I don't object to you asking it.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.950
- So you'd be upset if
someone else asked it.

26:42.950 --> 26:44.780
- [Kyle] Well, I should
mind, because it insinuates

26:44.780 --> 26:47.330
that I must've shat the proverbial bed.

26:47.330 --> 26:48.390
On the other hand, I don't mind

26:48.390 --> 26:50.423
because it is a valid fucking question.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.943
- Okay then, so tell me, why do you deal?

26:57.550 --> 26:58.640
- I like to exist

26:58.640 --> 27:02.300
outside the sphere of
conventional commerce.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.620
You know, away from all
this arbitrary bullshit.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.973
Like rules, laws, et goddamn cetera.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.233
- So what's your endgame?

27:13.930 --> 27:14.843
- I'm living it.

27:15.770 --> 27:18.323
I have no endgame, and
that's the way I like it.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.200
- Well that's great for you, but I do,

27:23.200 --> 27:24.513
so how does that help me?

27:25.640 --> 27:27.050
- Have you thought about
how you're gonna deal

27:27.050 --> 27:28.450
with this scholarship thing?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.850
- I have not been able to think about it.

27:40.010 --> 27:42.743
The whole thing just hit me like a truck.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.410
- Yeah, but you're an intelligent person.

27:45.410 --> 27:48.080
You must have some kind of hustle, right?

27:48.080 --> 27:48.913
- What do you mean?

27:48.913 --> 27:50.220
- I mean something that makes you money,

27:50.220 --> 27:51.993
like stocks or a side job.

27:56.370 --> 28:01.320
- No, not really. Except
I have a tutoring gig.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.790
- [Kyle] Yeah, but tutoring
can make you good money, right?

28:03.790 --> 28:05.710
- Yeah, if I had more than one client

28:06.590 --> 28:07.790
who I wasn't related to.

28:09.450 --> 28:12.588
- You have something else, right, Alex?

28:12.588 --> 28:15.433
'Cause I mean otherwise,
you're just a bum.

28:15.433 --> 28:18.350
(melancholy music)

29:19.600 --> 29:22.540
- That's ridiculous. Kyle's my friend.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.440
- You pay him, and he gives you weed.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.570
That's the extent of your relationship.

29:26.570 --> 29:29.360
- He's an honest guy. He gave
me a bit extra on the eighth.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.040
- He gives everybody a bit extra.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.160
Nobody actually weighs
their shit, come on.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.270
- So even if that's true,

29:34.270 --> 29:35.307
then he's stealing from you as well.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.110
- Yeah, but everybody steals
from everybody, right?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.550
Everyone fucks everyone else over, dude.

29:39.550 --> 29:42.220
Kyle stiffs us, we stiff
the waiter, the waiter-

29:42.220 --> 29:44.113
- We're not robbing Kyle!

29:47.020 --> 29:47.853
- Okay.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.570
That eighth that you just bought,

29:50.570 --> 29:52.510
did you smoke any of it?

29:52.510 --> 29:53.343
- Not yet.

29:55.780 --> 29:58.890
- How much do you think it
weighs? Come on, tell me.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.750
- Um, let's see, so an
eighth is 3.5 grams,

30:01.750 --> 30:04.313
so with a bit extra, that's 3.8.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.700
- I bet you if you weigh
that, you'll come around.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.403
- Mom.

30:44.292 --> 30:47.750
I didn't want to have to
have this conversation,

30:47.750 --> 30:50.477
and it's probably gonna
get fixed on appeal, but...

30:55.809 --> 30:56.759
- [Alex's Mom] But?

31:10.810 --> 31:12.560
- Everything from the structure

31:12.560 --> 31:17.040
to the precision of the
language, fucking phenomenal.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.393
- Oh, come on. Maybe I'm
good for a high schooler.

31:21.910 --> 31:24.860
And you're probably not supposed
to curse at your students.

31:25.980 --> 31:26.863
- Well, shit.

31:27.730 --> 31:28.990
I don't see any way you're not gonna get

31:28.990 --> 31:30.780
a perfect score on the essay section.

31:30.780 --> 31:33.883
- Thanks. I don't need any
more compliments, though.

31:34.850 --> 31:38.510
- Why, all this flattery making
you uncomfortable, Ger-bear?

31:38.510 --> 31:41.450
- Ugh, only my mom can call
me that, and I hate it.

31:41.450 --> 31:43.556
I get enough compliments.

31:43.556 --> 31:44.440
- Well, aren't you special.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.950
- I don't think so, but
apparently I'm a pro grade goalie,

31:47.950 --> 31:52.010
according to my coach, and I'm
a guaranteed valedictorian.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.900
- God, if I had that
coming out of high school.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.150
- It's a lot of pressure.

31:56.150 --> 31:58.993
All these people with all
of these expectations.

32:00.270 --> 32:02.350
- Well, a little pressure's a good thing.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.210
It keeps us accountable.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.700
- I think it's good to
fail every now and again.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.653
Gives us a chance to reevaluate.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.290
- Have you ever failed at anything before?

32:21.370 --> 32:24.870
- No, not in any meaningful way, no.

32:24.870 --> 32:27.420
My parents or my coach is
always there to catch me.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.610
It'd be interesting to see what it's like

32:30.610 --> 32:31.773
to actually fuck up.

32:33.850 --> 32:36.200
- It's a lot less
interesting than you'd think.

32:38.530 --> 32:41.143
But anyway, if you do
feel the need to fuck up,

32:42.220 --> 32:43.943
please don't do it tomorrow.

33:00.842 --> 33:03.342
(lamp clicks)

33:52.273 --> 33:54.856
(bag rustling)

34:09.658 --> 34:12.575
(depressing music)

34:22.020 --> 34:23.550
- [Kyle] That's solid work, you know.

34:23.550 --> 34:27.133
You're a great aspiring
filmmaker, you are.

34:32.030 --> 34:32.943
- Aspiring, huh?

34:34.380 --> 34:37.560
Yeah, I've worked too
hard to just be aspiring.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.500
- Well, have you made a movie yet?

34:39.500 --> 34:42.790
- Some shorts, but I busted my ass

34:43.920 --> 34:48.040
on this film, and I think
it's actually gonna be good.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.290
- You ever thought about
not working so hard?

34:51.460 --> 34:52.563
- Sounds lazy to me.

34:53.430 --> 34:55.680
- Yeah, but laziness
is good sometimes, man.

34:55.680 --> 34:56.803
It keeps us sane.

34:57.730 --> 34:59.523
It gives us time to reflect, man.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.460
- You spend too much time reflecting

35:03.460 --> 35:06.560
and you waste all the energy
that you could be using

35:06.560 --> 35:07.713
to actually do shit.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.640
- [Kyle] Fair point.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.260
Answer this, though. Why
do you do what you do?

35:15.730 --> 35:17.130
- Why do you do what you do?

35:18.500 --> 35:19.513
- I love what I do.

35:20.940 --> 35:23.063
Why do you do what you do?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.993
- I work to make money
so I can make films.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.970
- You didn't answer my question, though.

35:29.970 --> 35:32.343
Why do you make films?

35:34.270 --> 35:35.923
Why do you want to make films?

35:45.990 --> 35:48.660
Look at you, man, you're gonna explode.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.110
I feel like your brain's
gonna, like, just, pshh.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.133
You really need to learn
how to relax a little.

35:54.133 --> 35:55.950
- Why the fuck do you think I smoke?

35:55.950 --> 35:57.800
- Still, you're gonna burn out, man.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.010
You're gonna blow a gasket.

35:59.010 --> 36:01.890
- Yeah, but if I don't burn
out, I'm gonna succeed.

36:01.890 --> 36:02.790
- Succeed at what?

36:03.710 --> 36:07.040
- Succeed at being a success.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.370
Look, I will blow my fucking brains out

36:09.370 --> 36:12.853
if I end up being a corporate
stooge or a broke loser.

36:14.930 --> 36:17.393
What, what is your definition of success?

36:18.440 --> 36:20.793
- Easy, man. Being happy.

36:21.990 --> 36:23.720
- And are you happy?

36:23.720 --> 36:27.403
- Hell yeah. I wouldn't be
doing what I do if I wasn't.

36:29.090 --> 36:31.423
And how about you? Think
about it, for real.

36:32.610 --> 36:33.473
Are you happy?

36:41.021 --> 36:43.438
(door shuts)

36:47.055 --> 36:49.972
(elevator beeping)

37:17.155 --> 37:19.655
(tense music)

38:35.858 --> 38:38.858
(crickets chirping)

38:46.373 --> 38:47.530
I think your best bet is to write it

38:47.530 --> 38:49.400
like an appellate brief,
show that you have

38:49.400 --> 38:51.450
a practical understanding of writing,

38:51.450 --> 38:52.640
also that you're savvy enough

38:52.640 --> 38:55.180
that they want to make sure
they're one your good side.

38:55.180 --> 38:56.750
- That sounds intimidating.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.083
- Perks of a legal career.

38:59.340 --> 39:01.160
- [Alex] Why don't you wear
it on your sleeve more?

39:01.160 --> 39:03.163
- Because it is intimidating, you know?

39:04.170 --> 39:06.440
It's great for big
dicking cable companies,

39:06.440 --> 39:08.190
but it doesn't make me any friends.

39:09.223 --> 39:11.623
- [Alex] I guess I don't
like being intimidated.

39:12.470 --> 39:15.080
- Listen, I'm a drug dealer.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.450
I sell people distractions, anesthetics.

39:18.450 --> 39:20.210
People deal with me because
they don't want to deal

39:20.210 --> 39:21.100
with their own bullshit.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.350
- And what's my bullshit?

39:23.210 --> 39:25.563
- [Kyle] Come on, Alex,
you really want to do this?

39:26.470 --> 39:27.303
- Fuck yeah.

39:27.303 --> 39:28.140
- Convince me you're actually passionate

39:28.140 --> 39:29.890
about being a literature professor.

39:37.010 --> 39:39.950
- Call it narcissism or a power trip,

39:39.950 --> 39:44.340
but I feel happiest when I am teaching,

39:44.340 --> 39:47.980
when I am helping someone get better.

39:47.980 --> 39:51.120
I enjoy teaching driven people.

39:51.120 --> 39:54.290
Kids in college, by virtue
of having chosen to be there,

39:54.290 --> 39:57.850
are more likely to give a shit
about what they are learning.

39:57.850 --> 39:58.740
- That's wishful thinking.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.420
Is that what you were like in college?

40:00.420 --> 40:01.330
- You're not convinced.

40:01.330 --> 40:02.163
- I don't know, man,

40:02.163 --> 40:03.940
it sounds a bit like an essay, you know?

40:03.940 --> 40:05.600
You're telling me why
people go into teaching,

40:05.600 --> 40:08.520
but you're not telling me why
you want to go into teaching.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.130
- Well, I've worked my ass off for this.

40:10.130 --> 40:11.190
Does that not convince you?

40:11.190 --> 40:13.350
- That's working off sunken cost theory.

40:13.350 --> 40:15.980
You know, I dumped so much
time, money, and effort,

40:15.980 --> 40:18.250
and fuck, my identity into lawyering

40:18.250 --> 40:19.780
that quitting would've
meant putting my tail

40:19.780 --> 40:21.940
between my legs and
admitting that I fucked up,

40:21.940 --> 40:23.360
so I didn't abandon my investment.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.590
Instead, I worked my ass off to maintain

40:25.590 --> 40:27.523
the shitty fucking status quo.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.660
- So why'd you quit?

40:31.660 --> 40:32.623
- I got fired.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.233
- Why?

40:37.030 --> 40:38.033
- I got cocky.

40:40.270 --> 40:43.070
I started taking on cases
that I wasn't ready to handle.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.833
- Did you ever try looking for other work?

40:50.303 --> 40:52.853
- The day I got fired was
the worst day of my life.

40:55.690 --> 40:58.223
Pretty sure I cried when
I cleaned out my office.

41:00.710 --> 41:04.383
I woke up the next day around noon,

41:06.180 --> 41:07.190
and I realized

41:08.950 --> 41:10.850
I didn't have anywhere I needed to be,

41:12.220 --> 41:14.170
didn't have anyone I needed to impress,

41:15.660 --> 41:16.493
and that...

41:19.000 --> 41:20.650
That was the best day of my life.

41:27.230 --> 41:28.240
- So you think...

41:29.570 --> 41:32.333
So you think I should give
up on being a professor?

41:33.190 --> 41:36.093
- It's up to you whether or
not you want to be a professor.

41:39.170 --> 41:41.753
Now, do you want to write this
financial aid appeal letter?

41:44.118 --> 41:47.035
(optimistic music)

45:25.900 --> 45:28.567
(bag crinkling)

46:18.009 --> 46:19.990
- 2.7.
- 2.73 grams.

46:19.990 --> 46:21.590
Apparently that's an eighth now.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.620
- I told you.

46:23.620 --> 46:27.630
What, do you want to go shake
him down now for your...

46:27.630 --> 46:29.250
Actually, for my 40 bucks back,

46:29.250 --> 46:31.840
considering that you're
still in Darren debt?

46:31.840 --> 46:34.493
- No, I want to empty his fucking safe.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.410
I don't see anything wrong with
stealing from a drug dealer.

46:37.410 --> 46:40.140
Everybody fucks over everybody, right?

46:40.140 --> 46:42.553
- You know I was basically
kidding about that, right?

46:43.550 --> 46:44.383
- Basically.

46:47.870 --> 46:49.560
- Got to applaud you for the-
- He fucked us!

46:49.560 --> 46:50.953
Now we need to fuck him back!

46:50.953 --> 46:53.663
- Hey, hey, sh, easy
there girl, easy there.

46:55.170 --> 46:56.320
What's this really about?

46:56.320 --> 46:59.150
- It's about me getting
my money for grad school.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.620
What is he gonna do with all that cash?

47:01.620 --> 47:04.500
- I don't know, like,
maybe move to the beach,

47:04.500 --> 47:06.380
retire, take some lovers.

47:06.380 --> 47:09.330
- Retire off of money
he made by scamming us!

47:09.330 --> 47:12.010
- Didn't seem to bother you before.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.360
- I wouldn't be mad if he had just been

47:13.360 --> 47:14.630
fucking honest with us

47:14.630 --> 47:18.313
or if his advice had fucking
helped with my appeal letter.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.180
- So you trusted him to write an essay,

47:22.180 --> 47:25.760
he does a shitty job,
now you want to rob him.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.570
- Okay, okay, sure, sure.

47:27.570 --> 47:29.940
When you put it like that it
sounds kind of terrible, sure.

47:29.940 --> 47:31.603
Sure, but the fact is,

47:32.840 --> 47:36.423
I want to go to grad school,
and you want to make a movie.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.640
- I do want to make a movie.

47:44.505 --> 47:47.338
(Darren slurping)

47:58.610 --> 48:01.360
- Okay, I think we need to approach this

48:01.360 --> 48:04.890
in an orderly fashion, create an outline.

48:04.890 --> 48:05.960
- Step by step guide.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.310
- Go about it like a lawyer would.

48:07.310 --> 48:09.240
- So then what's step one?

48:09.240 --> 48:13.520
- Well, we need to figure out
how to get into his apartment.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.270
- Step two is restraining him.

48:15.270 --> 48:17.080
- Right, we don't want him fighting back.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.410
- How's your knot tying ability?

48:19.410 --> 48:20.243
- I'm okay.

48:22.090 --> 48:23.670
- Right.

48:23.670 --> 48:25.080
- What if he screams?

48:25.080 --> 48:26.633
- Stuff a towel in his mouth.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.520
- What if he does fight back?

48:30.520 --> 48:31.970
- We're fine, I know tai chi.

48:40.130 --> 48:41.373
- Darren knows tai chi.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.970
- Look, we've got to be
professionals about this, right?

48:43.970 --> 48:44.803
We can't have him thinking

48:44.803 --> 48:46.580
that we're a couple of fucking kids.

48:46.580 --> 48:49.880
Every morning I get
dressed up so people see me

48:49.880 --> 48:53.400
and assume that I know what
I'm doing, like a real adult.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.680
- Yeah, but there's a bit of a disconnect

48:54.680 --> 48:57.330
between being a real
adult and a real criminal.

48:57.330 --> 48:59.050
- It's the same idea, though, right?

48:59.050 --> 49:01.021
Why do you think gangsters
wear all that bling

49:01.021 --> 49:03.253
or, like, professors wear tweed, right?

49:05.030 --> 49:06.123
- It's a camouflage.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.740
Like a reptile pretending to be venomous

49:09.740 --> 49:10.920
so that it can ward of predators.

49:10.920 --> 49:14.060
- Yes, in the wild, animals
do what they need to do

49:14.060 --> 49:15.850
in order to survive.

49:15.850 --> 49:17.700
You've read "Crime and Punishment", right?

49:17.700 --> 49:19.773
- Yeah, I know my way around a Tolstoy.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.723
- Dostoevsky, dipshit.

49:23.446 --> 49:24.360
- Yeah, I know, it's a joke.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.500
I know my way around
bleak Russian literature.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.050
- Okay, so Raskolnikov's compelled

49:28.050 --> 49:28.940
to kill his landlord, right?

49:28.940 --> 49:30.850
He has to do it in order to survive,

49:30.850 --> 49:33.510
and he actually gets away
with it until, you know,

49:33.510 --> 49:35.713
his guilt comes in and fucks things up.

49:36.688 --> 49:38.506
- I need to do this.

49:38.506 --> 49:42.010
I need to earn something
for once in my life.

49:42.010 --> 49:45.110
I've never had to kill, but I
eat. I'm a fucking parasite.

49:45.110 --> 49:48.150
Do you know why I didn't
get the financial aid?

49:48.150 --> 49:50.363
- Weren't poor enough?
- No.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.440
I didn't submit the documents on time.

49:55.610 --> 49:59.293
I didn't do what I
needed to do to survive.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.460
- Wow, I mean, why didn't-
- I don't know.

50:03.460 --> 50:07.270
I don't know why I do or don't do.

50:07.270 --> 50:08.243
- [Darren] What the fuck
does that even mean?

50:08.243 --> 50:10.760
- I just keep thinking
about things and planning

50:10.760 --> 50:15.730
about things when I need
to be doing about things.

50:15.730 --> 50:16.563
- [Darren] Yeah, well,

50:16.563 --> 50:18.463
we know why we're doing this, you know?

50:20.540 --> 50:21.373
- Yeah.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.393
Net good, yeah, net good.

50:27.563 --> 50:30.163
If Kyle has all that
money, one person is happy.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.983
If we take that money,
two people are happy.

50:36.060 --> 50:38.610
- Besides, you know, once I make it big,

50:38.610 --> 50:40.630
he can get a cut of my
film or something, right?

50:40.630 --> 50:42.570
You know, pay off the debt.

50:42.570 --> 50:46.400
- So really, the only thing
that makes every person happy

50:46.400 --> 50:47.403
is us robbing him.

50:51.050 --> 50:52.880
- [Darren] I mean, we could
rationalize this all day,

50:52.880 --> 50:53.713
you know?

50:55.400 --> 50:56.253
So, yeah.

50:59.070 --> 51:00.513
You want to go do some drugs?

51:02.430 --> 51:04.483
Yeah, let's do some drugs.

51:07.097 --> 51:10.014
(optimistic music)

52:06.700 --> 52:07.643
Mr. Tanaka.

52:08.936 --> 52:12.103
(distant party music)

52:15.150 --> 52:18.283
Yeah, I'm so glad you came around.

52:22.740 --> 52:26.993
Oh yes, of course I could do
the film for under 200,000.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.863
Yeah, and the 15% we
agreed upon, absolutely.

52:35.950 --> 52:39.363
I assume that your lawyer will
send over the contract, then?

52:48.720 --> 52:49.643
Always a pleasure.

52:58.021 --> 53:00.688
(Darren laughs)

53:01.762 --> 53:04.345
(Alex panting)

53:08.490 --> 53:10.440
- Yeah, I know, I'm a bit out of shape.

53:12.290 --> 53:15.243
- It's not that. (clears throat)

53:16.280 --> 53:17.443
- [Alex] What is it, then?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.763
- Nothing, just some film shit.

53:26.220 --> 53:27.693
- [Alex] Do you want to talk about it?

53:31.070 --> 53:32.823
- Nah, it's fine.

53:34.302 --> 53:35.802
- [Alex] You sure?

53:39.070 --> 53:39.903
- It's fine.

53:48.757 --> 53:51.674
(melancholy music)

54:05.101 --> 54:07.851
(shower running)

54:52.342 --> 54:55.342
(crickets chirping)

55:04.700 --> 55:06.050
I got funding for the film.

55:09.315 --> 55:11.015
One of the producers came through.

55:13.090 --> 55:15.893
- Wow. Wow!

55:32.210 --> 55:33.910
- What the fuck would you do, huh?

55:36.254 --> 55:39.340
- I wouldn't just hang
me out to dry like this.

55:39.340 --> 55:40.923
- You think that's what I'm doing?

55:43.090 --> 55:44.440
Where were you when I
was trying to get funding

55:44.440 --> 55:45.940
for this film this whole time?

55:51.110 --> 55:52.090
- Why does everybody-

55:52.090 --> 55:54.623
- Why does everybody seem to
get what they want but you?

56:02.840 --> 56:05.880
- You know, I am, I am happy for you.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.053
I am happy for you.

56:08.520 --> 56:11.113
I'm just frustrated.

56:16.350 --> 56:17.650
- You're not happy for me.

56:19.930 --> 56:21.133
You're sad for yourself.

56:22.530 --> 56:24.743
- Like you were when I got into the PhD?

56:26.250 --> 56:27.083
- Yeah.

56:30.769 --> 56:32.069
Do you want a swig?
- No.

56:34.720 --> 56:35.910
I think I want

56:39.620 --> 56:40.537
to go home now.

57:08.250 --> 57:11.667
(Alex breathing heavily)

57:57.673 --> 58:00.590
(melancholy music)

58:38.256 --> 58:41.256
(crickets chirping)

59:31.063 --> 59:33.980
(elevator beeping)

59:48.581 --> 59:51.498
(fingers drumming)

1:00:11.777 --> 1:00:14.527
(metal clinking)

1:00:35.364 --> 1:00:38.781
(Alex breathing heavily)

1:00:51.211 --> 1:00:53.961
(metal clinking)

1:01:10.269 --> 1:01:12.769
(lock clicks)

1:01:20.770 --> 1:01:23.687
(optimistic music)

1:01:34.068 --> 1:01:36.818
(birds tweeting)

1:01:45.619 --> 1:01:49.036
(Alex breathing heavily)

1:02:25.068 --> 1:02:27.818
(train rumbling)

1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:01.943
- You just-
- Yeah.

1:04:15.749 --> 1:04:16.582
- Hey.

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:34.370
- I don't get it.

1:04:38.380 --> 1:04:41.880
I mean, these aren't bad
scores, per se, but...

1:04:44.550 --> 1:04:45.793
- I guess I just choked.

1:04:47.450 --> 1:04:50.590
- No, no, no, it's not that, no.

1:04:50.590 --> 1:04:54.153
Even if you choked, you
knew all of these answers.

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:56.753
What is it?

1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:03.403
- Fine, I bombed it.

1:05:04.820 --> 1:05:07.710
- Why? Why would you-

1:05:07.710 --> 1:05:10.120
- So that I would have a choice.

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.670
- If you don't get into these schools,

1:05:11.670 --> 1:05:12.730
you don't have a choice.

1:05:12.730 --> 1:05:16.483
- No, if I get into these
schools, I don't have a choice.

1:05:18.110 --> 1:05:20.090
- Have you ever tried
saying no to your parents?

1:05:20.090 --> 1:05:23.840
- That's not it, I've
got to say no to myself.

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:26.180
Every time that I want
to try something new,

1:05:26.180 --> 1:05:29.800
I get a fancy internship or
an award shoved in my face

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.523
and I always take the bait.

1:05:33.830 --> 1:05:36.740
- Have you tried studying
something you're passionate about?

1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:39.680
- I don't know what I'm interested in.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:41.863
I just want to take some time off,

1:05:43.220 --> 1:05:45.553
maybe work, travel.

1:05:48.820 --> 1:05:53.810
- So you're afraid of getting
pushed into something?

1:05:53.810 --> 1:05:55.260
- Yeah.

1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:58.053
If I keep on succeeding,
I'll get too comfy to say no,

1:05:58.940 --> 1:06:00.293
so I failed.

1:06:04.134 --> 1:06:05.284
- And how does it feel?

1:06:09.097 --> 1:06:10.692
- Disencumbering.

1:06:10.692 --> 1:06:13.609
(melancholy music)

1:07:22.311 --> 1:07:25.042
(crickets chirping)

1:07:25.042 --> 1:07:27.875
(water splashing)

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:42.150
- Have you paid tuition for school yet?

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:46.363
- Thanks for reminding
me. Got to get on that.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:51.463
- What are you telling
your mom about the money?

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:55.203
- Haven't really figured that part out.

1:08:02.310 --> 1:08:03.760
- You don't seem too excited.

1:08:06.980 --> 1:08:09.830
- Yeah, well, you don't seem
too excited about the movie.

1:08:12.950 --> 1:08:15.313
- I guess getting what
you want is overrated.

1:08:16.427 --> 1:08:21.427
- Yeah.

1:08:21.896 --> 1:08:24.813
(melancholy music)

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.950
- Hey, Alex, it's Kyle.

1:08:30.950 --> 1:08:35.200
I haven't talked to you in a
while and I just wanted to see

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:38.930
how you were doing and was
interested in, you know,

1:08:38.930 --> 1:08:41.543
knowing how that appeal
went, if it went through.

1:08:43.410 --> 1:08:45.010
I know you're busy and
everything like that,

1:08:45.010 --> 1:08:46.937
but I think we should hang out, you know?

1:08:46.937 --> 1:08:51.930
It was a good time hanging
out, and I kind of, well,

1:08:51.930 --> 1:08:54.230
anyways, if you could give me a call back,

1:08:54.230 --> 1:08:56.100
let me know, and maybe, you know,

1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:57.993
maybe we can hang one of these days.

1:08:59.010 --> 1:09:01.830
All right, appreciate it. Take care, Alex.

1:09:02.879 --> 1:09:06.629
(melancholy music continues)
