04:36.830 --> 04:38.002
Go in

04:44.838 --> 04:45.873
Move it

04:57.918 --> 04:58.828
Sit

04:59.720 --> 05:00.460
Sit down

05:00.888 --> 05:01.923
After you

05:05.959 --> 05:08.735
Careful with my jacket
It's expensive

05:11.131 --> 05:12.576
Get me a cushion

05:14.134 --> 05:16.273
Where is... the... money?

05:17.004 --> 05:18.574
I only talk to the boss

05:18.872 --> 05:21.546
Fine

05:28.816 --> 05:29.726
Here's the boss

05:35.255 --> 05:36.996
Who do you work for?

05:37.357 --> 05:38.301
I only talk...

05:39.560 --> 05:40.937
Where's the money?

05:42.029 --> 05:43.167
What?

05:43.931 --> 05:44.500
What?

05:44.832 --> 05:46.743
He wants to talk

05:57.277 --> 05:59.018
Was he with anyone?

05:59.246 --> 06:00.224
<i>No</i>

06:09.756 --> 06:10.996
His jaw is dislocated

06:11.492 --> 06:12.698
Put it back

06:23.837 --> 06:24.941
You'd planned...

06:25.272 --> 06:27.946
to rob us all along

06:28.675 --> 06:30.177
That's what you think

06:30.644 --> 06:32.248
Why would I do that?

06:32.613 --> 06:34.615
I sell insurance

06:35.983 --> 06:37.826
- Give me the water
- Yes

06:49.363 --> 06:51.900
There was a bozo, who wouldn't
pay protection money

06:52.399 --> 06:54.902
We went to his grocery store

06:55.335 --> 06:56.211
many times

06:56.436 --> 06:59.849
So I decided to meet him myself

07:08.682 --> 07:10.457
This clown was tough as nails

07:10.851 --> 07:11.955
just like you

07:12.786 --> 07:15.460
He played punching bag
for a while

07:15.789 --> 07:17.166
then his wife came back

07:17.958 --> 07:20.370
I said to him

07:20.527 --> 07:23.838
It's fine if you don't pay your wife
will see you in the morgue next

07:35.776 --> 07:36.584
Here

07:37.344 --> 07:38.482
Open your mouth

07:47.354 --> 07:49.891
The clown still refused

07:50.157 --> 07:52.967
His wife was looking at him

07:53.393 --> 07:55.771
as if saying "Are you crazy?"

07:57.564 --> 07:59.202
I put a knife to his wife

08:00.534 --> 08:01.945
and he caved right away

08:02.369 --> 08:03.211
Then...

08:03.904 --> 08:06.145
He took out all his money

08:07.007 --> 08:08.782
But as I was leaving

08:14.715 --> 08:15.523
Chop it off

08:23.490 --> 08:24.969
Guess what happened next?

08:27.427 --> 08:31.569
I... wanted him to eat
his wife's finger

08:32.566 --> 08:33.635
I told him

08:34.268 --> 08:36.270
If he didn't eat her finger

08:36.703 --> 08:40.674
Eat it or...
I'll chop off all her fingers

08:41.775 --> 08:43.379
He couldn't just swallow it

08:43.809 --> 08:45.653
He had to eat it
like a chicken wing

08:45.846 --> 08:46.916
Slowly...

08:47.447 --> 08:49.893
Suck it clean

08:59.359 --> 09:00.736
I didn't take your money

09:01.395 --> 09:03.500
Bullshit, tell me

09:04.564 --> 09:07.545
- I'll tell you if you're the boss
- I am the boss

09:08.235 --> 09:09.680
You are Tiger?

09:10.370 --> 09:13.044
The sign outside says
â€œTiger Import and Exportâ€œ

09:13.440 --> 09:15.750
I will only talk to Tiger

09:34.594 --> 09:35.937
Speak of the devil

09:36.330 --> 09:37.206
Has he talked?

09:37.798 --> 09:38.538
- Tiger
- Tiger

09:38.865 --> 09:41.402
He's slippery
Going in circles

09:42.703 --> 09:43.841
Where's my money?

09:50.877 --> 09:52.049
Don't waste my time

09:52.446 --> 09:55.256
Tell me
Where's my money?

09:55.549 --> 09:57.756
- I thought it was his money
- Who?

09:58.885 --> 10:01.627
Him
He said he was the boss

10:07.094 --> 10:08.903
Boss

10:15.635 --> 10:16.739
Boss

10:19.773 --> 10:21.878
We've been together thirty years

10:22.242 --> 10:23.619
See what I did
to my own right hand man

10:23.844 --> 10:27.053
Think what I'd do to you

10:37.290 --> 10:38.894
You think you're scary?

10:39.526 --> 10:40.869
Actually

10:42.929 --> 10:44.738
I'd rather be here with you

10:45.766 --> 10:47.803
You're all protecting me

10:52.105 --> 10:53.641
Compared to him

10:55.208 --> 10:56.881
you're the good guys

11:00.280 --> 11:01.315
What are you talking about?

11:02.549 --> 11:04.825
He's a thousand times
more vicious

11:05.719 --> 11:06.561
Tiger

11:06.753 --> 11:08.858
I'm just a poor
insurance salesman

11:09.823 --> 11:12.360
How could a guy like me
steal your money?

11:13.827 --> 11:15.465
Someone is messing with you

11:17.764 --> 11:19.209
Someone is messing with me?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.144
Someone is messing with me?

11:21.435 --> 11:23.847
You're nobody unless
someone messes with you

11:28.008 --> 11:29.009
Chair

11:31.278 --> 11:32.916
Get Tiger a chair

11:37.117 --> 11:38.858
Who's messing with me?

11:39.186 --> 11:40.256
And how?

11:42.355 --> 11:43.732
Tell me

11:48.829 --> 11:50.433
It all started...

11:52.232 --> 11:54.109
with a nursery rhyme

11:57.804 --> 12:00.842
One, two...
buckle my shoe

12:01.274 --> 12:04.448
Three, four, open the door...

12:04.845 --> 12:06.449
I won't like you

12:07.147 --> 12:09.718
He has a crush on me
Really

12:11.551 --> 12:14.327
One, two...
buckle my shoe,

12:14.788 --> 12:17.268
- Three...
- Mom, Happy Birthday

12:17.791 --> 12:19.793
Watch the crumbs

12:20.727 --> 12:21.865
My birthday?

12:22.295 --> 12:22.796
Yeah

12:23.730 --> 12:25.141
I like my husband

12:25.398 --> 12:28.379
One, two, buckle my shoe...

12:28.869 --> 12:30.871
My mother has schizophrenia

12:31.638 --> 12:33.584
and needs constant attention

12:35.609 --> 12:37.088
All these years

12:38.278 --> 12:40.918
I can only afford to put her
in places like this

12:42.282 --> 12:43.158
Mom

12:43.650 --> 12:45.755
Please lie down first

12:46.753 --> 12:50.599
- you can dance in bed
- Dance in bed?

12:52.926 --> 12:53.927
Okay

12:54.928 --> 12:55.872
Lie down

12:56.196 --> 12:57.334
Relax

12:58.565 --> 12:59.771
breathe

13:00.267 --> 13:01.041
Yes

13:01.468 --> 13:02.538
out...

13:04.104 --> 13:05.879
and in...yes...

13:06.306 --> 13:07.751
out...

13:13.813 --> 13:14.985
It's raining

13:18.752 --> 13:21.232
The ceiling leaks water
I want to change beds

13:23.990 --> 13:25.298
How about now?

13:32.332 --> 13:33.936
There are no empty beds

13:34.801 --> 13:36.439
I already told you

14:06.366 --> 14:08.312
I'm an insurance salesman
with a modest income

14:08.401 --> 14:10.472
I'm determined to earn more

14:11.504 --> 14:13.814
Because I've decided to...

14:14.007 --> 14:16.578
put my mother in the best home
even if I had to starve

14:31.124 --> 14:33.764
The day finally came,
I saved up enough money

14:34.694 --> 14:36.935
to take my mother away
from this filthy place

14:37.831 --> 14:40.004
and into a paradise

14:47.807 --> 14:48.285
- Hi
- Hi

14:48.675 --> 14:52.418
- Welcome to Greenwood...
- I am here to pay the deposit...

14:52.912 --> 14:54.858
- Jen Ma
- It's for Ms. Ma

15:00.353 --> 15:04.529
However
For her to be in paradise

15:05.525 --> 15:08.199
I had to return
to the concrete jungle

15:08.795 --> 15:09.830
back to the grind

15:10.063 --> 15:11.736
- Hi, beautiful
- Morning, Mark!

15:36.756 --> 15:38.702
You know the story of
"the tortoise and the hare"?

15:39.693 --> 15:40.967
You are the hare now

15:41.127 --> 15:43.971
- but the month is only half over
- I like being the bunny

15:44.597 --> 15:47.043
Unlike you content
to be just crawling

15:47.600 --> 15:49.204
I'll show you men can sell too

15:49.536 --> 15:53.006
Fine, then you can afford
to marry me

15:55.909 --> 15:58.116
- I want to talk to you about something
- Should I be worried?

15:59.679 --> 16:01.852
After I move my mother
to Greenwood

16:02.115 --> 16:03.890
Move in with me?

16:06.486 --> 16:07.829
I'll wait for your call

16:32.846 --> 16:35.884
It was this document
an insurance policy

16:36.349 --> 16:39.523
that changed everything

16:40.987 --> 16:43.160
Had I known this existed

16:43.523 --> 16:44.866
I would have recommended
settling immediately

16:45.358 --> 16:47.668
Can't we settle now?

16:47.961 --> 16:50.032
First of all,
they will not believe us

16:50.363 --> 16:51.740
Secondly,
we were in the wrong

16:52.132 --> 16:54.339
but we can't "settle"
at this point

16:54.734 --> 16:57.044
The point is... If this document
appeared in court

16:57.270 --> 16:58.408
then we are doomed

16:58.905 --> 17:01.852
Has anyone else seen
this certificate?

17:02.909 --> 17:03.853
<i>No</i>

17:13.787 --> 17:16.563
The plaintiff does not have it

17:16.923 --> 17:19.130
that's why we're at a stalemate

17:19.526 --> 17:22.200
Without new evidence,
the decision will go our way

17:22.628 --> 17:25.803
- I'm going on the stand tomorrow
- Suppose this document did not exist

17:26.065 --> 17:27.009
Never did

17:28.568 --> 17:32.015
You did not see the contents
of that envelope

17:33.072 --> 17:36.019
If you were asked
about that document

17:36.176 --> 17:38.213
It wouldn't be perjury,
if you said you didn't know

17:38.845 --> 17:39.585
But I know it exists

17:39.846 --> 17:42.827
You signed a confidentiality agreement
when you joined the company

17:44.384 --> 17:45.328
I see

17:45.552 --> 17:49.056
Connie, can you give us
a moment?

17:49.355 --> 17:50.197
Ok

17:53.159 --> 17:54.763
If I lie for the company

17:54.928 --> 17:57.841
a poor sucker will be screwed out
of his insurance money

17:58.431 --> 18:00.741
What do you want
the most right now?

18:01.334 --> 18:03.109
I want my mother to live well

18:03.436 --> 18:05.746
We are looking to hire
an assistant manager

18:06.206 --> 18:08.152
It is just a little lie

18:08.441 --> 18:10.216
I'm reviewing candidates

18:10.810 --> 18:12.585
Think carefully

18:17.050 --> 18:19.860
You have not given me
a direct answer, Mr. Ma

18:20.053 --> 18:21.964
Objection, asked and answered

18:22.689 --> 18:24.726
Mr. Ma, please answer

18:24.891 --> 18:29.601
Mr. Ma, in your opinion,
was Mr. Wu fraudulent in his claim?

18:30.396 --> 18:32.774
This old man is obviously
on his last legs

18:33.266 --> 18:34.745
I felt a bit guilty

18:35.835 --> 18:36.973
Mr. Ma

18:37.804 --> 18:41.547
Yes I believe he was fraudulent

18:44.744 --> 18:47.054
Attaboy

18:47.747 --> 18:50.751
Being a good son is admirable
Where's our money?

18:56.890 --> 18:59.598
Lying made me sick

19:00.159 --> 19:01.934
but it was worth it for my mom

19:03.563 --> 19:06.305
A few days later
everything changed

19:18.845 --> 19:19.915
What?

19:22.248 --> 19:25.286
The money I saved
for my mom disappeared

19:52.545 --> 19:54.525
First of all,
they will not believe us

19:54.847 --> 19:58.852
- Secondly, we were in the wrong
- Can't we settle now?

19:59.319 --> 20:01.026
It wouldn't be perjury,
if you said you didn't know

20:01.321 --> 20:04.097
But I know it exists
I believe he was fraudulent

20:12.065 --> 20:12.406
Hello

20:12.665 --> 20:15.908
Mimi just delivered a duplicate
set of the transcript you're holding...

20:15.969 --> 20:18.176
to Louis Zhang,
your opposing lawyer

20:18.671 --> 20:21.242
This is direct evidence
of your perjury

20:21.607 --> 20:24.713
If you don't want to go to jail
then get the document back

20:24.844 --> 20:26.448
Who is this?

20:27.847 --> 20:28.917
Who are you?

20:40.426 --> 20:41.962
- Mark
- Mimi

20:42.528 --> 20:43.268
I'm here

20:43.563 --> 20:46.442
and your envelope is almost there

20:46.966 --> 20:48.912
What's in it?

20:49.802 --> 20:51.247
Bring it back

20:51.771 --> 20:54.775
- Mimi, who told you to do it?
- You texted me

20:55.108 --> 20:57.179
- You asked me to...
- Hello?

20:57.810 --> 20:59.118
Hello?

21:04.083 --> 21:05.084
Who is this?

21:05.351 --> 21:09.766
Zhang will see the document
in ten minutes

21:09.956 --> 21:10.696
What do you want?

21:10.823 --> 21:15.329
In nine minutes
your life will be over

21:24.871 --> 21:27.408
- You took my money too?
- Universe Building

21:28.274 --> 21:28.979
Do I know you?

21:29.108 --> 21:30.985
- Floor MD
- Why me?

21:33.079 --> 21:35.855
Louis Zhang law office
Keep your head down

21:36.949 --> 21:39.657
- Hey, buddy, don't push
- I'm sorry, man

21:39.752 --> 21:42.460
So rude
Who are you?

21:43.723 --> 21:45.566
The envelope just left
the receptionist

21:46.159 --> 21:47.893
I need to see
Mr. Louis Zhang

21:47.894 --> 21:48.895
I'm sorry,sir,he...

21:49.128 --> 21:50.937
My colleague left
an envelope for him

21:51.330 --> 21:53.241
She made a mistake,
I have to get it back

21:53.533 --> 21:55.706
Where is his office?

21:56.335 --> 21:57.678
Sir, you can't go in,

21:57.870 --> 21:58.871
- Sir, sir!
- Which side?

21:59.238 --> 22:00.148
Right

22:01.808 --> 22:03.810
Sir, sir! Security.

22:05.645 --> 22:06.885
Left

22:09.649 --> 22:10.559
<i>Hum!</i>

22:11.884 --> 22:12.726
Sir

22:13.753 --> 22:14.754
Right

22:21.160 --> 22:22.969
I'm just here to...

22:23.663 --> 22:25.301
I can explain

22:27.333 --> 22:28.744
I want to speak to you

22:28.935 --> 22:30.471
about the case

22:32.805 --> 22:33.977
Let him go

22:34.273 --> 22:35.684
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes

22:38.077 --> 22:39.420
I want to ask you

22:39.745 --> 22:42.089
if you've checked the original
insurance certificate?

22:42.815 --> 22:43.816
The original insurance certificate?

22:45.184 --> 22:46.754
Just asking

22:48.588 --> 22:49.828
Let's talk in my office

22:51.491 --> 22:54.870
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. Let me help you.

22:59.799 --> 23:03.337
Mr. Zhang you're a smart man,
you'll figure it out

23:03.636 --> 23:05.877
I'm not that smart
Explain yourself

23:06.072 --> 23:07.551
Just think about it

23:21.721 --> 23:23.928
Get to Charity Road
in fifteen minutes

23:24.223 --> 23:25.327
Return my money

23:26.125 --> 23:27.900
When you're done,
I'll return your money

23:28.227 --> 23:31.037
- plus give you a $500,000 bonus
- I don't believe you

23:31.864 --> 23:34.367
Corner of Charity and Justice

23:34.767 --> 23:37.680
Have I offended you before?
If so, I apologize

23:38.905 --> 23:42.011
Who'd take care your mom
if you went to jail?

23:43.176 --> 23:45.178
Don't worry
Do as I say

23:45.745 --> 23:47.122
and you will be fine

23:47.446 --> 23:49.517
Keep your phone on

23:56.355 --> 23:58.392
Mimi, from now on,
unless you hear from me

23:58.558 --> 24:00.936
don't follow any orders

24:01.127 --> 24:03.573
Someone is out to get me

24:17.210 --> 24:18.883
Okay, I'm here
What do I do?

24:19.212 --> 24:21.453
There is a bag in the garbage
can up ahead

24:22.114 --> 24:23.889
Take it out

24:31.023 --> 24:33.367
Open it, put on the headset

24:38.197 --> 24:40.905
Put on the gloves
before you touch the gun

24:42.735 --> 24:44.578
I'm not touching any guns

24:44.904 --> 24:48.249
I have audio evidence
of your perjury

24:48.608 --> 24:53.057
Do you have a choice?
Think about your loved ones

24:53.746 --> 24:56.522
do you want them
to mourn for you?

25:04.890 --> 25:06.995
Now put on the mask
and the gloves

25:07.393 --> 25:11.102
From now on
do exactly as I say

25:12.865 --> 25:16.244
When you enter the restaurant
make them hit the floor

25:23.643 --> 25:26.453
Get on the floor. Please!

25:28.914 --> 25:30.052
Get down

25:31.884 --> 25:33.261
You punk! Get out of here!

25:34.754 --> 25:35.960
Use the gun

25:36.989 --> 25:38.161
Use the gun

25:42.762 --> 25:43.934
The gun, now

25:45.064 --> 25:48.238
Get back... Get back...

25:48.934 --> 25:50.242
Stand back

25:52.405 --> 25:53.475
Get down

25:53.706 --> 25:54.411
On the floor

25:54.707 --> 25:58.655
Tell them to empty their pockets

26:00.746 --> 26:03.522
Empty your pockets,
put everything in here

26:04.116 --> 26:05.720
In the bag

26:06.452 --> 26:07.453
Thank you

26:11.924 --> 26:13.460
Everything

26:17.229 --> 26:19.209
Everything in the bag, let's go

26:20.566 --> 26:24.275
Hey...Think about this
Don't be foolish

26:25.171 --> 26:27.583
He's stalling, hurry up

26:30.676 --> 26:33.213
Everyone... I'm really sorry

26:44.123 --> 26:46.569
Cross the street to the Cadillac

27:12.351 --> 27:13.921
Are you waiting for the police?

27:14.053 --> 27:15.691
I want the transcript destroyed

27:15.955 --> 27:17.263
and all my money back

27:17.590 --> 27:19.968
You'll get it back
when the job is done

27:20.893 --> 27:22.770
- Follow the directions on the GPS
- Where am I going?

27:23.329 --> 27:26.173
You need to be at the bank by 5

27:46.719 --> 27:48.562
Why the bank?

27:49.288 --> 27:51.165
Relax It's not a robbery,

27:51.757 --> 27:53.100
you don't have what it takes

27:53.492 --> 27:56.132
Find the keychain
with the peace sign

27:58.164 --> 28:01.407
Eight minutes left

28:02.768 --> 28:04.179
- Found it
- Put on the hat

28:04.870 --> 28:06.679
Go make a withdrawal

28:15.448 --> 28:16.927
Act natural

28:20.920 --> 28:24.527
She's the manager
at the second window

28:24.790 --> 28:27.737
Go up to her
and give her the envelope

28:35.434 --> 28:37.243
Not her, bend down

28:40.773 --> 28:42.411
Get up

28:44.743 --> 28:45.653
That's her

28:46.445 --> 28:47.446
Jessica?

28:50.916 --> 28:52.224
Mark?

28:53.486 --> 28:55.227
What are you doing here?

28:55.855 --> 28:58.802
I work here
What are you doing here?

28:59.024 --> 29:00.697
Find a room
and give her the envelope

29:00.793 --> 29:01.737
What is this?

29:01.794 --> 29:04.104
- A nice surprise for you
- Who are you talking to?

29:04.797 --> 29:07.539
Do as I say or I'll get her too

29:07.833 --> 29:09.744
- Can we talk in private?
- I'm working,

29:10.035 --> 29:12.538
- I can't talk now
- We must talk in private. Now!

29:18.444 --> 29:20.856
Before you open this
I want to tell you

29:21.080 --> 29:22.457
I don't know what's inside

29:37.029 --> 29:37.905
Help!

29:38.264 --> 29:39.208
Stop screaming

29:39.865 --> 29:40.935
I'm being blackmailed, too

29:41.066 --> 29:43.205
I didn't know you had a son
Really

29:45.571 --> 29:46.845
Who's blackmailing you?

29:47.273 --> 29:48.149
I don't know

29:48.707 --> 29:51.711
You don't know?
What have you done with Billy?

29:51.911 --> 29:55.688
Don't worry
he's in Mrs. Huang's piano class

29:56.115 --> 29:58.652
Your son is in Mrs. Huang's
piano class, right?

29:58.851 --> 30:00.524
Call his teacher

30:07.026 --> 30:08.004
Hello, Mrs Huang

30:08.360 --> 30:10.636
Can I speak to Billy please?

30:11.730 --> 30:12.606
Billy

30:13.465 --> 30:14.808
I'll come and pick you up
after work

30:15.234 --> 30:16.907
Stay with the teacher

30:17.236 --> 30:18.442
don't go anywhere

30:18.904 --> 30:20.247
I love you, sweetie

30:21.173 --> 30:23.779
For your son's safety
you've got to help me

30:24.743 --> 30:26.017
Help you with what?

30:33.519 --> 30:36.693
She was my high school
sweetheart

30:38.123 --> 30:39.261
First love

30:40.893 --> 30:43.806
I don't know how the asshole
found out about her

31:30.876 --> 31:32.617
- Got it
- Go

31:34.713 --> 31:37.819
Hey what are you going
to do with my son?

31:38.484 --> 31:41.055
Take your son
and move as far as possible

31:44.890 --> 31:46.665
It's good to see you again

31:46.892 --> 31:49.099
Don't tell anyone what
we did and we'll both be okay

32:01.874 --> 32:03.182
Sir? Please wait

32:06.712 --> 32:08.783
Sir, your hat

32:09.415 --> 32:10.894
Oh, thank you

32:31.570 --> 32:33.208
Nice little reunion

32:34.106 --> 32:35.380
What's in the bag?

32:35.874 --> 32:36.908
Eight million dollars

32:36.909 --> 32:37.887
Whose money is it?

32:38.277 --> 32:40.689
The police chief
you robbed earlier

32:41.146 --> 32:42.784
Police? There wasn't one

32:42.848 --> 32:46.295
The last guy you robbed
in the Italian restaurant

32:46.652 --> 32:48.427
was the Chief of Police

32:56.562 --> 32:59.406
The police chief just happens
to have...

32:59.631 --> 33:01.838
- eight million dollars?
- It's not his money

33:02.601 --> 33:04.842
It's there in case of a hostage crisis

33:05.771 --> 33:07.808
I've done everything you asked
when will you let me go?

33:08.240 --> 33:09.981
It's not over yet,

33:10.509 --> 33:11.579
keep driving

33:18.383 --> 33:19.555
Turn and stop

33:23.522 --> 33:26.662
There's a tracking device woven
into the duffel bag

33:27.192 --> 33:29.297
Transfer the money
to the other bag

33:35.768 --> 33:37.543
There's a knife
in the glove compartment

33:40.706 --> 33:44.017
Cut open the side of the bag
There may be a dye pack

33:44.209 --> 33:45.813
- A what?
- You might trigger...

33:46.311 --> 33:47.881
a paint explosion from the top

33:48.080 --> 33:50.856
Then you'd have paint all over you

33:59.992 --> 34:01.801
Don't get any ideas
about the money

34:11.270 --> 34:12.408
Now what?

34:14.606 --> 34:15.777
Now wait

34:40.599 --> 34:42.943
I can't waste any more time
with you, I must go

34:43.268 --> 34:45.612
You will go only when I tell you to

34:45.904 --> 34:48.350
You seem Omnipotent,
everything's on your radar

34:48.706 --> 34:51.244
Everything's under your control,
why do you need me?

34:51.543 --> 34:55.889
One, I needed a puppet
to make the bank withdrawal

34:56.315 --> 34:59.489
Two, I enjoy this feeling

34:59.685 --> 35:02.529
Don't push me
I'm not a bad guy

35:02.888 --> 35:04.890
You are not a bad guy

35:06.091 --> 35:09.868
If you weren't bad, I wouldn't
be able to control you

35:09.995 --> 35:12.236
I'm just an ordinary.
Insurance salesman

35:12.331 --> 35:14.572
You feel it's unfair that

35:15.000 --> 35:18.743
Out of the millions of people,
why were you picked?

35:18.904 --> 35:23.751
I didn't pick you
you picked me

35:24.509 --> 35:28.252
I... I don't understand

35:28.747 --> 35:31.694
If you didn't commit perjury

35:32.117 --> 35:34.859
I wouldn't be able
to blackmail you

35:35.287 --> 35:39.258
Therefore
You did this to yourself

35:59.211 --> 36:00.918
Want to know who I am?

36:01.947 --> 36:04.928
Take the bag and get in the jeep

36:54.933 --> 36:59.075
Bastard If you think I'm gonna
let you fuck with my family

37:00.305 --> 37:02.251
Come on. I'm going to kill you

37:06.912 --> 37:09.051
- I'm not him
- The fuck you're not

37:09.514 --> 37:10.891
I'm being blackmailed too

37:11.149 --> 37:12.150
It's true

37:27.466 --> 37:28.774
Where are we going?

37:29.634 --> 37:31.443
How the hell do I know?

37:36.675 --> 37:37.813
It's him

37:39.211 --> 37:40.212
Yea?

37:40.679 --> 37:41.783
Pass him the phone

37:42.914 --> 37:43.858
He wants to talk to you

37:45.784 --> 37:48.321
- Hello
- If we met like that

37:48.720 --> 37:50.290
that would be very rude

37:51.156 --> 37:54.296
Now you've got a hapless friend
To keep you company

37:54.593 --> 37:55.571
What now?

37:55.827 --> 37:58.740
You go shopping
with all this cash, of course

38:04.803 --> 38:06.680
How long has he been
controlling you?

38:06.905 --> 38:09.442
Too long, I'm about to break

38:09.908 --> 38:11.581
What's he got on you?

38:12.444 --> 38:15.391
Dog fighting
Just a small time dealer

38:15.847 --> 38:19.818
to feed the family. The guy
threatens to send me to jail

38:20.352 --> 38:23.026
He's got me in the palm
of his hands

38:23.955 --> 38:25.059
What do you do?

38:25.824 --> 38:27.804
- I sell insurance
- What?

38:27.926 --> 38:30.873
If you're not insured
I have just the policy for you

38:30.996 --> 38:33.977
It's not for you
it's for your family

38:35.200 --> 38:36.543
You mean

38:36.968 --> 38:40.643
I'd make more money
for my family after I'm dead?

38:44.409 --> 38:45.786
So who the fuck is this guy?

38:46.745 --> 38:49.123
I hired a private detective
to find out

38:49.481 --> 38:52.360
- And?
- He's a hard motherfucker to trace

38:53.051 --> 38:53.825
Came up empty

38:53.952 --> 38:57.297
The way I see it
If you can't fight him, avoid him

38:57.589 --> 38:59.262
If I had the money

38:59.758 --> 39:02.739
I'd disappear forever

39:18.110 --> 39:20.386
Are we here to buy garbage?

39:21.046 --> 39:24.892
- What's in the bag?
- Money

39:25.283 --> 39:26.284
How much?

39:26.518 --> 39:29.658
- Eight Million Dollars
- Eight Million Dollars

39:44.269 --> 39:46.772
Listen
Pack up everything tonight

39:47.172 --> 39:51.416
Keep the phone close to you
wait for my call

39:51.543 --> 39:55.013
Wait for my call and get
our daughter ready Okay?

39:58.683 --> 40:00.890
Sweetie, you're still up?

40:01.586 --> 40:03.964
You sleep tight,
When you wake up

40:04.289 --> 40:06.769
Daddy will be there holding
a big teddy bear

40:11.129 --> 40:13.905
I melt every time
I hear her voice

40:24.910 --> 40:26.821
- Let's go
- And do what?

40:28.880 --> 40:31.451
I'm just the driver
you're the one making the trade

40:31.650 --> 40:32.822
There's no one here

40:34.853 --> 40:36.855
Don't move, you got the money?

40:37.889 --> 40:38.924
It's right here

40:44.863 --> 40:46.900
That's it... That's it...

40:46.965 --> 40:48.308
I'm not taking anymore of this shit

40:48.667 --> 40:51.273
This is bullshit

40:52.771 --> 40:55.581
It's now or never
let's do it together

40:55.840 --> 40:57.251
- Are you in?
- In for what?

40:57.375 --> 40:59.082
What else?

40:59.411 --> 41:00.822
We take the money
and the goods

41:01.146 --> 41:03.319
- Split it 50-50
- It's too risky

41:03.682 --> 41:05.855
You like being controlled?

41:10.722 --> 41:13.760
We have one enemy now
if you mess up, there'll be more

41:14.125 --> 41:15.263
Listen

41:15.560 --> 41:16.538
You won't do it?

41:16.828 --> 41:18.808
I'll do it myself

41:31.910 --> 41:33.821
I should have turned
around and left

41:34.012 --> 41:36.458
but I didn't have the head
to leave him

41:36.748 --> 41:39.752
This guy Sam may
look like an animal

41:39.884 --> 41:43.422
but he's just like me
doing his best for his family

41:43.955 --> 41:46.765
Me for my mother
and he, for his daughter and wife

42:01.172 --> 42:02.480
I don't know what to do

42:02.874 --> 42:05.821
I only knew that...
if I didn't help him

42:06.444 --> 42:07.821
he'd die

42:28.133 --> 42:29.237
Serves you right

42:30.669 --> 42:33.479
I take a leak
and you piss everyone off

42:36.207 --> 42:37.208
Who are you?

42:37.676 --> 42:39.849
We're here for the candy

42:40.912 --> 42:42.323
You know you screwed up, right?

42:45.350 --> 42:46.624
I know

42:47.052 --> 42:48.463
Who's in charge here?

42:53.825 --> 42:54.997
What happened to Rat?

42:55.427 --> 42:58.965
Who is Rat?
We didn't see anyone

42:59.264 --> 43:00.902
We thought it was
the wrong place

43:02.467 --> 43:03.810
Hey! On your feet

43:07.405 --> 43:09.783
Fishhead... go find Rat

43:13.945 --> 43:16.186
Let's look at the candy
while we wait for Gnat?

43:17.615 --> 43:19.026
It's Rat

43:26.157 --> 43:29.400
Look at you
Can't even walk straight

43:31.796 --> 43:32.934
You dumb-ass

43:36.568 --> 43:37.546
Move it

43:51.549 --> 43:52.619
Thanks

43:54.319 --> 43:55.923
We do the deal and leave

43:57.055 --> 43:58.363
I can't find Rat

43:58.923 --> 44:02.302
Hey we don't have all day
and we can't wait

44:02.694 --> 44:03.764
let's do the deal

44:16.841 --> 44:17.785
Painkillers?

44:21.513 --> 44:23.925
Guys.
What the hell is this?

44:24.282 --> 44:25.625
Didn't your boss tell you?

44:25.917 --> 44:26.827
Prescription drugs

44:27.252 --> 44:28.856
I showed you my honey
show me your money

44:29.254 --> 44:30.733
- It's...
- in the car

44:32.223 --> 44:33.759
I'll get it

44:42.834 --> 44:43.904
Here's the money

44:50.175 --> 44:52.519
This will be all over soon

44:52.811 --> 44:54.484
Easy easy...

45:10.128 --> 45:11.971
I'll take care of them

45:13.832 --> 45:15.436
Let's just leave, okay?

45:20.104 --> 45:21.139
Well?

45:23.908 --> 45:27.685
Don't move.
Drop your weapons.

45:29.147 --> 45:32.060
- You're dead meat
- Who wants to go first

45:32.383 --> 45:35.023
- Get the bag
- Fishhead, pop his head

45:35.353 --> 45:37.424
Stay back. Release him

45:37.755 --> 45:38.733
Shoot his face

45:38.890 --> 45:40.335
Get in the fucking car

45:40.825 --> 45:42.361
Shoot him

45:44.496 --> 45:45.440
Go.

46:04.215 --> 46:07.094
Hey, what is it?
Get in the car

46:08.720 --> 46:09.425
Where it is...?

46:09.854 --> 46:11.333
What are you doing?

46:14.893 --> 46:16.531
- Found it
- Found what?

46:17.161 --> 46:18.071
Let's go

46:27.372 --> 46:30.785
My daughter gave this to me

46:31.643 --> 46:34.852
She'd be upset if I lost it

46:37.515 --> 46:41.691
- Take the money and the goods
- It's ours

46:42.887 --> 46:44.764
Your insurance policy
If I had listened to you

46:45.823 --> 46:50.135
and bought one

46:51.029 --> 46:53.600
My daughter would
have some money...

46:58.236 --> 46:59.943
Hey... Hey

47:08.479 --> 47:10.516
- Hello
- You must answer my calls

47:10.848 --> 47:12.555
See what happens
when you don't listen

47:13.051 --> 47:15.622
- Leave with the money and the goods
- And him?

47:15.887 --> 47:17.457
You want to keep him company?

47:17.855 --> 47:19.698
Drop off the goods
at a location I specify

47:19.791 --> 47:22.465
wait for further instructions

48:31.396 --> 48:32.739
That was you?

48:33.531 --> 48:35.772
Impressive.
It made the headlines

48:36.968 --> 48:38.811
That's why you had no leads

48:39.070 --> 48:41.072
Who'd have thought it
was an insurance guy

48:43.274 --> 48:45.720
<i>The assholes you killed
worked for us</i>

48:45.843 --> 48:47.845
I didn't kill them or know
who they worked for

48:48.079 --> 48:49.786
I was pressured into it

48:50.281 --> 48:52.318
Maybe he's your enemy

48:52.717 --> 48:53.821
Who's got the balls?

48:55.653 --> 48:56.461
Mac the Knife?

48:56.888 --> 48:57.764
Westie Sword?

48:58.356 --> 48:59.266
Dance Peak Stick?

49:00.391 --> 49:02.564
Those guys are... stupid as shit

49:02.960 --> 49:04.769
They don't have the brains

49:05.163 --> 49:07.973
So who is it?

49:14.172 --> 49:16.209
I bet you're dying to pee

49:17.208 --> 49:19.210
Okay, okay, I'll continue

49:28.786 --> 49:30.891
For all the shit I went through

49:31.089 --> 49:33.091
the only silver lining was...

49:34.425 --> 49:36.063
seeing Jessica again

49:39.430 --> 49:41.171
I didn't contact her again

49:41.866 --> 49:46.212
only occasionally reminisced...

49:49.407 --> 49:52.820
about our days together
I was stressed and afraid

49:53.544 --> 49:56.923
to keep the money at home
so I had it with me at all times

50:25.309 --> 50:27.687
We want to be in control
of our own life

50:28.045 --> 50:29.319
Sometimes it works

50:30.481 --> 50:31.892
But we are mere mortals

50:33.284 --> 50:35.059
some things
are beyond our control

50:49.934 --> 50:50.969
Jessica

50:53.838 --> 50:55.146
You said you were blackmailed

50:55.573 --> 50:58.383
- What's the money doing here?
- I can explain...

50:59.510 --> 51:01.683
Don't take the money
We'll be dead

51:01.946 --> 51:03.186
ls Billy okay?

51:06.884 --> 51:08.022
You bastard

51:08.920 --> 51:10.456
leave my son alone

51:10.888 --> 51:12.993
- What the hell do you want?
- What is it?

51:13.291 --> 51:15.862
Billy is your son

51:17.728 --> 51:19.605
He's your son

51:47.959 --> 51:49.700
Why didn't you tell me?

51:52.230 --> 51:53.573
Tell you?

51:57.602 --> 51:59.206
HOW?

52:01.672 --> 52:03.618
You moved, cut off your phone

52:04.175 --> 52:05.813
Even your mom couldn't find you

52:06.110 --> 52:07.885
I thought you'd died

52:11.515 --> 52:12.653
I'm sorry

52:17.588 --> 52:19.397
The only thing I was thankful for

52:19.790 --> 52:21.667
was that you gave me a son

52:23.794 --> 52:25.831
I live for him

52:30.601 --> 52:32.444
he's my everything

53:28.993 --> 53:32.304
the new office is posh

53:33.597 --> 53:36.771
What happened?
The turtle slept his way to the top?

53:37.268 --> 53:38.110
Don't be silly

53:39.637 --> 53:40.809
What's going on?

53:42.807 --> 53:43.877
Hmm...

53:44.308 --> 53:45.150
Mimi

53:45.743 --> 53:47.188
I need to apologize

53:48.479 --> 53:50.049
I think we should be apart
for a while

53:51.315 --> 53:54.228
- What do you mean?
- Do you feel you know me?

53:58.289 --> 53:59.359
Everything okay?

54:02.493 --> 54:04.905
Come upstairs with me
I'll introduce you to the team

54:06.464 --> 54:09.536
After that
the phone stopped ringing

54:12.236 --> 54:14.273
- until one day...
- The Voice is back?

54:14.839 --> 54:15.749
<i>No</i>

54:30.654 --> 54:31.894
- Hello?
- Hello?

54:32.156 --> 54:34.466
- I found the fucker
- What?

54:35.226 --> 54:38.833
I was able to trace his phone
and monitor his calls

54:39.196 --> 54:39.833
Who is this?

54:40.231 --> 54:43.735
- I am... Who are you?
- You're looking for Sam?

54:44.001 --> 54:44.979
Where's Sam?

54:45.870 --> 54:46.848
Who are you?

54:47.505 --> 54:49.781
My name is Moon,
Sam's private detective

54:49.974 --> 54:52.250
Tell him, I found the guy
he was looking for

54:53.878 --> 54:56.620
2pm tomorrow,
corner of Peace Avenue

54:56.847 --> 54:57.791
I have to work

54:58.215 --> 55:01.719
Don't forget what I have
on you, I can ruin you

55:02.086 --> 55:03.759
What do want me to do?

55:05.823 --> 55:09.771
You can be certain...
you are not the only victim

55:10.428 --> 55:11.805
there are at least three more

55:12.229 --> 55:14.937
I intercepted this today

55:17.334 --> 55:19.041
Who is this asshole?

55:19.503 --> 55:20.880
You can find out

55:21.439 --> 55:22.281
HOW?

55:24.008 --> 55:26.818
Help me get him
then you will know

55:28.879 --> 55:31.689
- I can't help you
- Sam was my best friend

55:33.317 --> 55:37.697
My new kidney was from Sam
I owe him my life

55:41.358 --> 55:45.807
I can't bring him back
but I can avenge his death

55:46.030 --> 55:47.008
Thank you for your trust

55:47.264 --> 55:48.937
but that's your fight, I'm out

55:49.400 --> 55:50.174
Wait

55:50.568 --> 55:53.276
Get this right
your buddy played with fire

55:53.704 --> 55:56.014
and lost his life
I'm outta here

56:13.724 --> 56:16.705
Be at the corner of Peace Avenue
at 2pm tomorrow

56:16.894 --> 56:20.341
I've had enough
Take your money back

56:20.931 --> 56:21.909
I'm done with you

56:22.199 --> 56:25.180
Let's try a different scenario
Old lovers reunite

56:25.469 --> 56:27.540
They have a son
but if one goes missing...

56:27.805 --> 56:29.478
Enough, Fuck you

56:35.880 --> 56:38.861
Help me get him

56:44.922 --> 56:47.368
Then you will know

56:54.365 --> 56:55.935
- Excuse me
- It's alright

56:58.269 --> 57:02.274
Mark, we can't
just pack up and leave. We can't

57:02.907 --> 57:05.080
Mark.
Who is that guy anyway?

57:05.309 --> 57:06.811
What's going on?

57:07.211 --> 57:09.213
Go hide out for a while

57:09.480 --> 57:10.322
Billy

57:11.348 --> 57:12.656
take care of your mother

57:27.965 --> 57:29.740
- Name?
- Mark

57:30.067 --> 57:31.705
Get in

57:44.315 --> 57:45.726
Give me the bag

57:45.883 --> 57:46.759
Wait

57:50.588 --> 57:51.931
What was that?

57:52.489 --> 57:54.594
He said to throw it into
an on-coming white car

57:54.825 --> 57:55.997
You sure it was that one?

57:56.493 --> 57:58.131
Nope

57:59.763 --> 58:01.367
How much farther?

58:02.333 --> 58:04.904
- Don't you know?
- Of course not

58:05.269 --> 58:06.805
He gave me a general direction

58:07.771 --> 58:09.648
It's okay, he'll call

58:10.774 --> 58:12.720
This guy he dumped me with...

58:12.843 --> 58:14.720
was either an idiot-savant
or just an idiot

58:18.315 --> 58:19.692
No, thanks. You go ahead

58:22.853 --> 58:25.231
I always bring food
when I do this shit

58:25.623 --> 58:28.160
you never know where
that jerk is sending you

58:28.492 --> 58:30.335
how far or how long it takes

58:31.595 --> 58:35.702
I must say this shit is way more
exciting than what I normally do

58:37.534 --> 58:38.945
What do you do?

58:39.303 --> 58:40.941
Toll church bells? Dig graves?

58:41.639 --> 58:42.674
Make nails?

58:43.507 --> 58:45.919
Very funny,
who does those things?

58:50.347 --> 58:51.655
Yeah

58:54.051 --> 58:55.291
Okay

58:55.552 --> 58:57.031
Pull over after that light

59:01.759 --> 59:03.295
- What's your name?
- Larry

59:04.194 --> 59:05.468
Get in

59:07.398 --> 59:09.400
The bastard said to pick up Larry

59:10.801 --> 59:12.610
Hello... It's me

59:13.570 --> 59:14.378
Yeah

59:16.840 --> 59:18.046
We're all here

59:21.145 --> 59:21.850
What did he say?

59:22.046 --> 59:24.822
Said to go to
â€œTiger Import and Exportâ€œ

59:29.953 --> 59:31.159
You sure this will work?

59:31.955 --> 59:33.195
Relax

59:36.360 --> 59:37.566
Trust me

59:38.429 --> 59:39.772
Keep cool

59:47.438 --> 59:48.815
Search them

59:58.615 --> 59:59.685
Let's check the merchandise

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.024
Yo, Dogshit

01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:04.965
My name is not Dogshit,
it's...

01:00:07.591 --> 01:00:08.797
Get on it

01:00:30.347 --> 01:00:31.724
Sweet

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:43.260
Of course
Top of the line

01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:46.632
Want to give it a try?
Try it?

01:00:47.598 --> 01:00:48.576
What the fuck?

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.440
Just kidding

01:00:51.068 --> 01:00:53.412
- I got it
- No bullets

01:00:55.973 --> 01:00:56.678
Are you nuts?

01:00:56.874 --> 01:00:59.821
The crates aren't full,
only tomato cans underneath

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:02.315
Just follow my lead

01:01:02.846 --> 01:01:05.588
It's nothing, he was
only kidding with you

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.758
You're dead

01:01:10.053 --> 01:01:10.895
Hello?

01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:15.735
- Hey, no phones
- It's my boss

01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:18.302
We are making the delivery

01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:22.038
- Get the money and go
- A scam from the get-go

01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:25.380
Something for nothing
No risk to him

01:01:25.836 --> 01:01:29.374
He used suckers like us
to steal for him

01:01:30.007 --> 01:01:31.486
Go, get in the truck

01:01:33.243 --> 01:01:34.847
You heard him

01:01:35.045 --> 01:01:37.321
he doesn't want
to see your face!

01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:39.158
Alright

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:44.163
You got the cash?
We have to get going

01:02:17.554 --> 01:02:19.158
- Goods checked out?
- All good

01:02:23.961 --> 01:02:25.736
- Pay them
- Got it

01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:49.221
Looks good

01:02:49.453 --> 01:02:52.923
- Count it
- Shut up, get back in the truck

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:54.525
I'm sick of you

01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:56.799
Scram

01:02:58.896 --> 01:02:59.840
That's it

01:03:00.163 --> 01:03:01.767
Good doing business with you

01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:15.851
Go... go...

01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:22.125
What happened?

01:03:22.486 --> 01:03:24.932
Only the top layer had guns
Only tomato cans underneath

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:27.865
- You set us up
- Go ahead

01:03:30.027 --> 01:03:30.971
Hold on

01:03:35.065 --> 01:03:37.511
Keep going
to the next destination

01:03:38.035 --> 01:03:39.241
Fuck you

01:03:43.106 --> 01:03:44.016
Come on

01:03:44.508 --> 01:03:45.418
Get in

01:03:46.476 --> 01:03:47.079
Get in

01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:48.255
Go to the back

01:03:49.212 --> 01:03:50.850
Let me drive

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.287
Go

01:03:57.888 --> 01:04:01.700
Dogshit, you'll live well
with this money

01:04:26.717 --> 01:04:28.094
Moon and I

01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:30.762
deviced a plan

01:04:31.688 --> 01:04:33.190
Jessica joined us

01:04:33.924 --> 01:04:36.461
Things were going
according to plan

01:04:36.994 --> 01:04:38.200
We did it

01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:56.186
To reach our final goal
there was one step left

01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:00.427
- Let's split the loot
- split the loot

01:05:03.453 --> 01:05:05.330
- Mister put the money back
- Stop it

01:05:05.856 --> 01:05:08.496
He would hunt us down

01:05:08.759 --> 01:05:10.466
You're no match...
for that asshole

01:05:10.827 --> 01:05:14.001
- But we have his money
- I don't care, step away from the car

01:05:14.865 --> 01:05:17.368
Fine, you keep all the money

01:05:17.768 --> 01:05:19.839
Are you crazy?
You can't just give it to him

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:22.941
No way
I risked my life for Sam

01:05:23.407 --> 01:05:25.785
- Like hell he's taking it all
- Both of you, shut up

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.857
Jeff Take... all the money

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.886
But don't give it to him,
don't let him win

01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:37.459
Answer it

01:05:41.558 --> 01:05:42.798
Where's my money?

01:05:44.394 --> 01:05:45.998
We made off with it

01:05:46.863 --> 01:05:49.537
You're not going anywhere
Jeff knows whom to listen to

01:05:49.933 --> 01:05:51.810
There's three of us
and only one of him

01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:53.842
I have faith in Jeff

01:05:54.004 --> 01:05:56.848
Whoever has the gun
is the boss

01:05:57.441 --> 01:06:00.854
I've revealed your identity
to Tiger's men

01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:04.015
Mark, see you in hell

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:10.322
Alright you win again

01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:11.524
the money is yours

01:06:11.788 --> 01:06:13.734
He won, we're going with you

01:06:13.924 --> 01:06:16.734
- What? I'm not buying it, get back
- What are you afraid of?

01:06:16.927 --> 01:06:17.735
Don't move

01:06:17.961 --> 01:06:19.599
He said you knew where to go

01:06:19.963 --> 01:06:22.500
- Yes I do
- Jeff, we're on the same side again

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:42.352
We knew Jeff would do this

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:50.460
As long as we follow the money
we'd catch that bastard

01:07:06.143 --> 01:07:07.383
I'll go take a look

01:07:24.094 --> 01:07:25.164
He's gone,

01:07:25.529 --> 01:07:26.564
the bag is still there

01:09:10.533 --> 01:09:12.341
Don't move or you die

01:09:14.203 --> 01:09:15.841
We meet at last

01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:18.849
I did what you asked
I got the money

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:21.783
What? Bullshit.

01:09:24.848 --> 01:09:27.294
Mark. We got conned

01:09:29.051 --> 01:09:30.895
You'll get her killed

01:09:31.388 --> 01:09:32.298
What are you talking about?

01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:37.095
He has my wife if I don't deliver
the money he's going to kill her

01:09:39.496 --> 01:09:41.203
The guy is an animal

01:09:41.464 --> 01:09:45.037
He forced me to... he forced me to eat my wife's finger

01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:56.048
After all the pain we went through
In the end The Voice won

01:09:59.883 --> 01:10:01.760
We went our separate ways

01:10:01.952 --> 01:10:04.125
and then your guys
brought me here

01:10:07.757 --> 01:10:10.795
What was that...
about his wife again?

01:10:11.761 --> 01:10:15.299
He said...
"He forced me to eat my wife's finger"

01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:21.005
You've got some nerve Tiger

01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:24.378
He's full of shit,
don't listen to him

01:10:24.908 --> 01:10:26.785
What about the finger?

01:10:27.744 --> 01:10:29.587
I told him the story myself

01:10:29.879 --> 01:10:34.225
- just before you arrived to get him talking
- That's right, It's true

01:10:36.686 --> 01:10:39.257
Okay, okay...
Let me get this straight

01:10:45.195 --> 01:10:46.435
You're telling me

01:10:47.564 --> 01:10:50.807
it was The Voice...
who screwed you out of my money

01:10:54.437 --> 01:10:54.812
Yes

01:10:55.105 --> 01:10:57.745
And he made that man
eat his wife's finger

01:10:58.108 --> 01:10:58.848
Yeah

01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:02.088
I'm just a pawn in his con game

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:07.123
Quite an actor. And the Oscar
goes to fuckhead over here

01:11:07.183 --> 01:11:09.459
Devil, you stole from me?

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:16.769
Yeah, I'm a mastermind

01:11:16.926 --> 01:11:20.169
I'm so smart, I planned it all, right?

01:11:20.563 --> 01:11:22.736
- You're The Voice
- Yes

01:11:22.866 --> 01:11:24.038
You were watching me?

01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:26.770
Not only do I monitor you,
I can control you

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:29.878
I can tell you when to take a leak

01:11:30.173 --> 01:11:32.050
Go to the corner
of Peace Avenue now

01:11:36.913 --> 01:11:37.857
Yes, sir

01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:46.766
Shit, I laughed so hard
I have to pee

01:11:47.357 --> 01:11:48.927
I'll be right back

01:11:51.194 --> 01:11:54.767
You're a good storyteller

01:11:55.532 --> 01:11:57.341
You almost got us to turn
on each other

01:11:57.801 --> 01:12:00.543
Let me tell you, there's
a problem with your story

01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:03.818
Throughout the transaction,
devil was with you the whole time

01:12:04.307 --> 01:12:07.447
How could The Voice
have called you?

01:12:09.245 --> 01:12:10.519
He wasn't there
the whole time

01:12:10.814 --> 01:12:14.455
Fucking liar, I was here all the way

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:15.957
You were there
the whole time, right?

01:12:16.186 --> 01:12:16.857
- Yes
- No,

01:12:17.087 --> 01:12:18.828
ask the guys who were there

01:12:23.359 --> 01:12:25.669
I did step away to pee
for a little while

01:12:25.829 --> 01:12:30.835
then I came right back
to inspect the merchandise

01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:34.471
He went to pee doesn't
make him The Voice

01:12:35.505 --> 01:12:37.951
I'll prove he isn't The voice

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:40.582
Devil, give me your phone

01:12:52.889 --> 01:12:53.867
What's your number?

01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:56.334
1597...

01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:57.502
1656...

01:13:02.866 --> 01:13:03.810
Where's your phone?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.001
In my jacket

01:13:34.964 --> 01:13:36.170
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:13:43.907 --> 01:13:46.888
Everyone has their hobby,
I have mine

01:13:47.143 --> 01:13:48.451
You're sick

01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:51.655
I like to study human nature

01:13:51.814 --> 01:13:55.057
I watch the worst
of humanity everyday

01:13:55.451 --> 01:13:57.624
why not put them to use?

01:13:58.054 --> 01:14:00.591
They want to be controlled

01:14:00.823 --> 01:14:03.269
Yes, I am The Voice

01:14:03.693 --> 01:14:06.299
- And the money?
- I don't have it, they took it

01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:08.768
You don't have it?
Bullshit

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:12.204
I was onto you

01:14:13.469 --> 01:14:15.710
since the drug deal,
we lost money and goods

01:14:15.805 --> 01:14:17.906
I knew something was not right

01:14:17.907 --> 01:14:18.942
Tiger

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.053
He fooled you

01:16:18.695 --> 01:16:19.901
I know who he is

01:16:20.029 --> 01:16:22.407
- Don't change the subject
- He's behind it all

01:16:22.765 --> 01:16:25.143
I know you're smart

01:16:25.635 --> 01:16:27.080
you think you're better than me

01:16:27.437 --> 01:16:28.848
and want my seat

01:16:28.971 --> 01:16:31.645
Come get it now

01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:34.082
If you dare

01:16:35.211 --> 01:16:36.884
Give it your best shot

01:16:37.146 --> 01:16:39.183
He's playing Us

01:16:39.882 --> 01:16:41.225
Are you monitoring me?

01:16:41.718 --> 01:16:43.561
- No, I would never do that
- I don't believe you

01:16:43.786 --> 01:16:45.925
This is all pan of his plan

01:16:46.789 --> 01:16:48.564
to come between our brotherhood

01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:49.766
Brotherhood?

01:16:50.426 --> 01:16:53.202
Don't be an idiot, use your head

01:16:54.364 --> 01:16:58.574
I didn't pick him
He picked me

01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:02.080
You are their son

01:17:08.277 --> 01:17:10.223
Where is my money?

01:17:14.684 --> 01:17:16.027
It's him

01:17:26.863 --> 01:17:28.137
Are you that smart?

01:17:29.966 --> 01:17:32.947
Tiger... We are no match for him

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.281
He will beat us all

01:17:36.806 --> 01:17:41.653
Tiger Don't hesitate
Let's kill him

01:17:48.985 --> 01:17:50.931
One last time

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.685
One, two...

01:18:49.846 --> 01:18:51.223
buckle my shoe

01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:54.890
Three, four, open the door

01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:58.855
Five, six, pick up sticks

01:20:05.588 --> 01:20:07.067
Mom, Uncle Jeff

01:20:09.225 --> 01:20:10.727
We did as you said

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.636
Thank you, Chief
for looking after him

01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:15.408
- Where's the money?
- Here

01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:19.745
It's all there

01:20:19.969 --> 01:20:21.573
How's Mark?

01:20:21.971 --> 01:20:22.949
Yea

01:20:23.172 --> 01:20:24.207
We traced his...

01:20:24.707 --> 01:20:26.414
phone signals fifteen minutes ago

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:28.217
SWAT is on its way

01:20:36.052 --> 01:20:37.886
Help, help

01:20:37.887 --> 01:20:40.925
- Okay
- Mom. Don't touch her

01:20:43.292 --> 01:20:46.000
- Billy, say Hi to grandma
- Grandma

01:20:55.204 --> 01:20:56.774
He was right

01:20:58.708 --> 01:21:02.246
It was me who chose you

01:21:03.746 --> 01:21:06.522
I waited many years
for this chance

01:21:07.183 --> 01:21:08.890
to seek revenge for my mother

01:21:09.852 --> 01:21:12.059
When I found out Devil
was Mimi's client

01:21:12.989 --> 01:21:14.593
I saw an opening

01:21:18.094 --> 01:21:20.836
You two weren't as tight
as you looked

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.410
Devil was harboring ambitions

01:21:26.469 --> 01:21:28.779
I got all your financial
records from Mimi

01:21:30.006 --> 01:21:34.079
and found the share Devil got
would not satisfy him

01:21:35.811 --> 01:21:37.722
So I set my plan in motion

01:21:38.848 --> 01:21:41.351
and took advantage
of Devil's favorite pastime

01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:43.528
and fed him
erroneous information

01:21:44.654 --> 01:21:46.224
The document he found

01:21:46.889 --> 01:21:48.891
was planted by me

01:21:58.467 --> 01:22:00.413
Had I known this existed

01:22:00.803 --> 01:22:02.043
I would have recommended
settling immediately

01:22:02.705 --> 01:22:05.345
The point is... If this document
appeared in court

01:22:05.675 --> 01:22:06.813
then we are doomed

01:22:07.243 --> 01:22:09.587
Can't we "settle" now?

01:22:12.815 --> 01:22:16.888
Mr. Ma, in your opinion,
was Mr. Wu fraudulent in his claim?

01:22:17.253 --> 01:22:20.791
The lawsuit was real
my promotion was real

01:22:21.223 --> 01:22:23.499
but I didn't commit perjury
for the company

01:22:23.726 --> 01:22:26.297
Mr. Wu did file a fraudulent claim

01:22:27.163 --> 01:22:28.733
the recording was fake

01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:33.209
Devil took the bait
and started to control me

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:38.243
Mimi just delivered a duplicate set
of the transcript you're holding...

01:22:38.774 --> 01:22:40.879
to Louis Zhang,
your opposing lawyer

01:22:43.846 --> 01:22:45.917
Now it's time for Moon
to make his entrance

01:22:47.016 --> 01:22:48.495
He was protecting me
all the way

01:22:49.151 --> 01:22:51.153
to ensure our plan succeeds

01:22:52.555 --> 01:22:55.866
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Let me help

01:22:57.927 --> 01:22:59.531
Excuse me

01:23:00.129 --> 01:23:01.199
I'm sorry

01:23:15.811 --> 01:23:16.915
I led Devil to believe

01:23:17.713 --> 01:23:20.193
I was his puppet

01:23:24.787 --> 01:23:27.563
My plan needed support
from the police

01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.600
The police chief
showed his acting chops

01:23:31.127 --> 01:23:34.700
and planted
an irresistible bait for Devil

01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:37.706
The money is already
in a safe deposit box

01:23:46.408 --> 01:23:48.911
Devil played right into our hands

01:23:49.145 --> 01:23:51.091
and became greedier
and greedier

01:23:53.883 --> 01:23:56.762
Tiger, the deal is on tomorrow

01:23:57.086 --> 01:23:58.929
I need 20 million in cash

01:23:59.488 --> 01:24:03.300
He wasn't content
with chump change

01:24:03.526 --> 01:24:06.336
2pm tomorrow,
corner of Peace Avenue

01:24:09.765 --> 01:24:14.544
Actually,
it was you who chose me

01:24:17.239 --> 01:24:21.881
I don't know what you're saying

01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:25.055
If you didn't commit perjury

01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:27.683
I wouldn't be able to blackmail you

01:24:28.651 --> 01:24:32.497
You reap what you sow

01:24:34.924 --> 01:24:36.926
He thought he could
control everyone

01:24:37.827 --> 01:24:39.773
that we were all his pawns

01:24:41.197 --> 01:24:43.609
But in fact he was
under our control

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:49.549
and so were you

01:24:50.239 --> 01:24:52.150
The four of us finally
got our chance

01:24:52.608 --> 01:24:54.986
to use you to get Devil

01:25:03.886 --> 01:25:06.059
Who the hell are you guys?

01:25:06.789 --> 01:25:08.496
We grew up together

01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:12.503
They came to play in our store

01:25:12.962 --> 01:25:14.737
just like my mom's own children

01:25:18.868 --> 01:25:22.577
That day Jessica and I
were hiding in the attic

01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:09.829
Afterwords...

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.699
my mother suffered a breakdown,
and my father killed himself

01:27:16.185 --> 01:27:17.493
We did it

01:27:17.886 --> 01:27:19.866
Really? It worked?

01:27:21.123 --> 01:27:22.295
Finally

01:27:31.433 --> 01:27:32.741
I love you

01:27:36.238 --> 01:27:37.376
I love you too

01:27:38.907 --> 01:27:40.181
and you

01:27:41.276 --> 01:27:42.721
Please... don't... Please...

01:27:42.878 --> 01:27:44.721
- Please...
- Mom... It's alright...

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:45.524
- It's alright Mom...
- It's alright...

01:27:46.215 --> 01:27:47.888
- It's alright...
- It's alright...

01:27:48.384 --> 01:27:50.830
- It's alright...
- Mom... It's over

01:27:51.787 --> 01:27:53.460
They are never coming back

01:27:53.956 --> 01:27:56.197
They will never hurt you again

01:27:56.325 --> 01:27:58.271
Mark got rid of all of them, Mom

01:28:05.167 --> 01:28:06.305
Son

01:28:10.406 --> 01:28:11.612
One

01:28:11.907 --> 01:28:12.942
Two

01:28:13.242 --> 01:28:13.879
buckle

01:28:14.843 --> 01:28:16.686
my shoe

01:28:17.112 --> 01:28:22.289
Four, open the door

01:28:22.684 --> 01:28:26.757
Five, Six
Pick up sticks

01:28:27.156 --> 01:28:30.933
Seven, Eight,
lay them straight...

01:28:31.827 --> 01:28:32.737
One, Two

01:28:32.928 --> 01:28:34.032
buckle my shoe

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:38.305
Three, Four, open the door

01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:15.671
Hello?

01:29:16.038 --> 01:29:17.039
Mark

01:29:17.306 --> 01:29:18.376
Who are You?

01:29:19.305 --> 01:29:25.636
