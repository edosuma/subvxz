45:53.480 --> 45:55.482
I never lied to you.

45:57.710 --> 46:00.611
Of all the things
I thought you was,

46:00.670 --> 46:03.309
a liar was never
one of them.

46:05.710 --> 46:07.109
Maybe...

46:10.070 --> 46:13.028
Maybe you'll see
things differently
if you hear me out.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.028
I'm listening.

46:17.070 --> 46:19.152
I was home
for the weekend.

46:19.210 --> 46:21.337
In DC.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.519
And I was using.

46:27.430 --> 46:31.082
And there was a party
with some boys--

46:31.130 --> 46:33.178
I ain't trying to hear about
who you did what with.

46:36.660 --> 46:39.788
Iwanna know _
why you carried a lie

46:39.840 --> 46:41.444
for the last seven years.

46:44.140 --> 46:47.359
Why you looked me
in my face

46:47.410 --> 46:49.014
and told me
you loved me?

46:49.060 --> 46:51.620
- Because I do.
- And told me you was clean

46:51.670 --> 46:54.230
and sober
and working your steps.

46:54.280 --> 46:58.319
You told me that
all that matters to you
is me and Blue.

46:58.380 --> 47:03.022
- All that is true.
- Then you turn around
and keep a lie like this?

47:04.730 --> 47:07.244
A poison like this?

47:09.910 --> 47:12.037
I wanna know why.

47:17.260 --> 47:20.263
There's no excuse.
Wsumm

47:24.270 --> 47:25.874
It's unacceptable.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.704
But here you are...

47:29.280 --> 47:31.054
asking me to accept it.

47:31.100 --> 47:32.795
I'm asking you
to try and understand.

47:32.850 --> 47:36.229
So tell me something
I need to understand!

47:36.280 --> 47:38.840
You talking,

47:38.890 --> 47:40.846
but you ain't saying nothing
that mean nothing yet.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.585
I was scared!

47:43.640 --> 47:46.541
I was scared
for my life, okay?

47:52.040 --> 47:55.680
That I couldn't remember
what happened with those guys.

47:59.390 --> 48:02.348
That I ended up pregnant.

48:02.400 --> 48:06.962
And I didn't know
if it happened that night

48:07.010 --> 48:09.649
or with the man
that I was in love with.

48:13.620 --> 48:17.533
That if I had a baby,
I couldn't use.

48:26.380 --> 48:27.859
[ sighs ]

48:27.900 --> 48:29.800

fell apart.

to say?

to say to you?

48:51.840 --> 48:55.879
You say, "I'm pregnant.

48:57.320 --> 49:00.278
And I don't know
if it's yours."

49:01.670 --> 49:04.719
Just like that,
from the jump.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.765
I remember the day
you told me.

49:13.770 --> 49:16.989
Been over it again
and again in my head.

49:19.860 --> 49:25.082
You told me
that he was mine.

49:27.570 --> 49:29.561
You let me celebrate.

49:31.920 --> 49:33.524
You let me be proud.

49:37.060 --> 49:40.575
And then you took--
took it all away from me.

49:42.890 --> 49:45.586

my family did.

You ain't have
to do it this way.

49:52.770 --> 49:54.067

49:54.120 --> 49:57.021
It ain't true!

49:57.080 --> 50:00.982
You lied that day
and every goddamned day since.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.122
You...

50:03.170 --> 50:07.288

50:11.350 --> 50:13.568
Blue...

50:13.610 --> 50:16.135
Darla, come on.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.738
How could you?

50:20.660 --> 50:22.571
I betrayed you.

50:26.630 --> 50:31.067
And I deserve
whatever you decide.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.196
But I need you
to know...

50:40.250 --> 50:43.299
that every part
of me...

50:45.910 --> 50:47.901
I am so sorry.

50:53.740 --> 50:56.265
And I hope someday
you can forgive me.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.528
I'll never look at you
the same.

51:09.890 --> 51:12.882
I'll never _
trust you again.

We're over?

51:42.660 --> 51:44.389

How I'm gonna be
with you if I--

51:49.580 --> 51:51.184
if I can't trust you?

51:53.280 --> 51:55.532
I-- I can't do it.

51:55.590 --> 51:57.273
What about Blue?

52:02.680 --> 52:04.728
You can leave me...

52:06.860 --> 52:08.634
you can turn away
from me...

52:11.250 --> 52:13.639

in my veins...

ain't in his.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.202
You'll take him
for a while?

53:00.740 --> 53:02.128
I got him.

53:09.270 --> 53:10.999
So what you gonna do?

53:13.010 --> 53:17.049
I'll go home
to my parents and...

53:26.630 --> 53:28.495
try to continue.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.810
Tell him I got
a little sick.

53:39.860 --> 53:41.464
And, um...

53:42.870 --> 53:44.644
I went to get better.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.605
And that I'll be back
to take him swimming.

I didn't expect
to see you for a while.

That makes two of us.

54:47.670 --> 54:50.230
What changed?

54:50.280 --> 54:55.320
I want to apologize
for being abrupt

54:55.370 --> 54:56.928
the other day.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.322
You were trying
to make an offer

54:58.380 --> 55:00.940
and I was
caught up in...

55:02.730 --> 55:03.594

55:05.560 --> 55:07.596
My eyes are open now.

Tell me what you want.

55:12.870 --> 55:15.304
You.

55:15.350 --> 55:18.399
The mill is just
a place to begin.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.998
You and me,

55:20.050 --> 55:24.612

don't know we're a team.

Let's take everything
up a notch.

55:35.630 --> 55:38.019
No partnership.

55:38.070 --> 55:40.106
You're buying it outright.

[ chuckles ]

55:43.030 --> 55:44.895
You fought
all these months

55:44.950 --> 55:47.077
to get your mill
up and running,

55:47.120 --> 55:50.908
stole our farmers away,
and now you want to sell?

55:52.170 --> 55:55.424
I'm tired of fighting.

55:57.700 --> 56:00.089
Truth is,
I've lost a lot.

56:03.050 --> 56:05.746
I was so focused
on Winning...

56:08.100 --> 56:10.261
I wasn't there
for my son,

56:10.320 --> 56:15.189
I alienated
my whole family,

56:15.240 --> 56:16.582
and, um...

56:16.630 --> 56:21.101
it cost me a very...

56:26.160 --> 56:30.119
important relationship.

56:36.480 --> 56:40.439
My daddy,
he used to say,

56:40.480 --> 56:43.608
"If you set after
doing something

56:43.660 --> 56:47.619
and learn a lesson
on the way...

56:51.490 --> 56:53.264
even if you lose...

56:55.360 --> 56:56.884
it's still a victory."

56:59.800 --> 57:02.883
Selling the mill is far

57:02.940 --> 57:06.103
from the hopes and dreams
I had when I had bought it.

57:10.250 --> 57:12.286
But I find that...

57:13.950 --> 57:16.032
dreams are funny things.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.679
They, uh--
they morph...

57:24.040 --> 57:25.473
and reshape...

57:27.260 --> 57:28.955
in an instant.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.223
So here's the deal.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.401

the day-to-day operations,

57:44.460 --> 57:46.587

57:46.630 --> 57:49.497
I remain the face
and driving force.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.337
and they'll mill
with me.

And you and I arrange
a refinery percentage.

58:01.820 --> 58:03.469

another arrangement?

I wanted to name you
Andrew or Brian.

to honor him with the name,

Something that nobody
in the family ever had before.

I should give you
a rare name.

not a lot of people have
in the whole wide world.

on a crayon

her name could make

1:02:27.130 --> 1:02:29.303
the color violet.

about that.

that was... perfect.
