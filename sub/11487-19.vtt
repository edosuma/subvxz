00:02.800 --> 00:03.789
You're up early.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.474
Well, it's a beautiful day,
shame to waste it sleeping.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.154
-Must've got to bed early then.
-l guess.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.390
Well, you know what they say.

00:11.560 --> 00:16.236
Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy and can't get laid, huh?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.639
Maybe l'm not trying.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.837
Yeah. And look for me next month
on the cover of Maxim.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.754
l'll have nothing on but the vacuum.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.796
-Hey, you're up early.
-Yes, Alan, l'm up early.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.475
l went to bed early and l slept alone.
Anything else you wanna know?

00:34.840 --> 00:36.796
Was l this cranky
when l wasn't having sex?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.595
No,
you were more of a sullen whiner.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.190
-Okay, Huggy Bear, l gotta go.
-Oh, all right, Kandi, have a good day.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.635
Yo, Daisy Mae.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.636
Just out of curiosity, when you
leave here, where is it you go?

00:50.800 --> 00:54.952
To the gym. l have to take care
of my body because it's my instrument.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.716
Mine too.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.555
Three beers and a bratwurst
and my ass turns into a French horn.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.075
Really? Whenever l have beer
and bratwurst l just fart a lot.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.199
Okay. Okay, Kandi, well,
l'll see you tonight.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.793
Bye, everybody.

01:12.960 --> 01:13.949
Congratulations, Alan.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.078
lt looks like you've officially
boinked her brains out.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.835
Okay, so she's not
overly sophisticated.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.549
Sophisticated? She's two marbles
rolling around in a tin can.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.474
Hey, hey, she's got a great heart,
she's warm and loving.

01:28.640 --> 01:32.155
-And she genuinely cares for me.
-l stand corrected.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.072
One marble.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.752
Look, buddy, l'm happy
you finally found an instrument to play. . .

01:38.920 --> 01:41.354
. . .that isn't in your own pants.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.996
But she's been spending
a lot of time here.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.515
lf you're not careful,
she's gonna wanna move in.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.548
Would that be so bad?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.630
Hey, l don't have a lot of rules
around here. . .

01:51.800 --> 01:54.633
. . .but nine of the top ten
are just different ways of saying:

01:54.800 --> 01:57.030
''Women are not allowed
to live here. ''

01:57.200 --> 01:58.872
They come and they go.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.999
Often they do one of those multiple
times, but in the end they always go.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.316
But why is that so important?

02:05.480 --> 02:09.553
Alan, there's a natural balance
in this house, which must not be upset.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.358
lt's like the Amazon rain forest.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.476
You bring in one too many
spider monkeys. . .

02:13.640 --> 02:15.676
. . .you're up to your ass in tree frogs.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.474
Oh tree frogs.
That clears up everything.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.393
Don't patronize me,
you hump-happy simpleton.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.835
-You know what l'm saying.
-l do.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.310
lf Kandi were to move in here,
it would be an environmental disaster. . .

02:27.480 --> 02:29.232
-. . .of epic proportions.
-Exactly.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.631
She's been living here
the past three weeks.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.477
-What?
-Who's the simpleton now?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.670
Kandi got evicted from her apartment
three weeks ago and she moved in here.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.355
Oh, please, if a woman was living
in my own house for that long. . .

02:44.520 --> 02:45.953
. . .l think l'd notice.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.193
Oh, really? Really?
Well, let's try a little experiment.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.635
What color is the couch
in the living room?

02:54.280 --> 02:57.875
-The couch?
-No peeking. What color is it?

02:58.880 --> 03:02.031
Well, it's kind of a--

03:02.200 --> 03:05.158
Beige-ish--

03:09.240 --> 03:10.673
Tan.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.111
-You sure?
-Yeah, l'm sure.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.916
-Go look.
-Fine.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.710
What the hell is that?

03:25.040 --> 03:26.029
Your couch.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.270
Jake spilled grape juice on it
last summer.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.709
l had it reupholstered.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.474
-Last summer?
-Yeah, it was gone almost a month.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.279
Berta and l bet
on how long it would take you to notice.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.034
l had 50 bucks on never.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.794
All right, all right this is unacceptable.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.350
This is my house and if furniture's
gonna get reupholstered or moved. . .

03:44.520 --> 03:47.717
. . .or changed in any way whatsoever,
l demand to be consulted.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.599
-Okay, from now on. l promise.
-Thank you.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.389
l bought the damn thing.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.439
Think l'd have a vote,
maybe show me a swatch.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.234
Hey, wait a minute,
did somebody say Kandi's living here?

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:33.320 --> 04:34.753
Boy, am l thirsty.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.434
That's because you sweat so much
during sex.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.270
l may not have the biggest boat
in the marina.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.715
But nobody rows harder than me.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.349
You have a boat?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.715
-No, sweetie, what l meant was--
-Hey, hey, hey.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.997
Some of us don't wanna hear
about your little dinghy.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.793
-Oh, hi, Charlie.
-What're you doing here?

04:55.960 --> 04:57.678
l was asking myself the same thing. . .

04:57.840 --> 05:01.355
. . .so l did a little research
and it turns out it's my house.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.397
Yeah, but l thought
you were going out.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.757
-l did go out. And then l came back.
-Alone?

05:07.920 --> 05:10.559
No, Alan, l brought home
an invisible cocktail waitress.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.712
She's doing me even as we speak.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.919
You're right. There's no way
you could've been that cranky.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.873
You want some company, Charlie?

05:21.040 --> 05:23.315
Alan can't have sex again
for at least 30 minutes.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.989
That's a rough estimate.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.390
Thanks, but l'd really rather be alone.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.189
Okey-doke. Come on,
l think he wants to masturbate.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.028
Not for at least 30 minutes.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.916
Okay, l haven't sampled anything
from the other side of the buffet. . .

05:54.080 --> 05:56.514
. . .since l traveled
with the Grateful Dead.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.194
But golly Moses, she's a muffin.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.238
lnteresting turn of events, huh?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.150
Your brother hitting
one of your hand-me-downs.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.949
And you couldn't get laid if you
painted your penis to look like money.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.791
Don't think l haven't tried.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.470
l'm reminded of the tale
of the tortoise and the hare.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.631
lsn't there something
you could be doing?

06:19.160 --> 06:22.835
Well, l could go rub some oil on her,
but l don't trust myself.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.670
Berta, please don't take this
the wrong way. . .

06:26.840 --> 06:30.879
. . .but it's been a long time for me
and you're starting to turn me on.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.675
l'm out of here.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.759
-Hi, Berta.
-Hey, baby.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.754
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.033
-Boy, this is weird, huh?
-ln so many ways.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.992
But which one caught your attention?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.750
Well, l've never slept
with brothers before.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.717
l mean at different times.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.997
And one can't help
but make comparisons.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.158
No kidding.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.756
So how big a difference
are we talking about?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.275
lt's huge.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.996
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.628
With you, sex is kind of
like going on Space Mountain.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.031
lt's a good ride,
but there's never any real danger.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.200
With Alan, it's like being
in the back seat of a car. . .

07:16.360 --> 07:19.477
. . .driven by a really smart kangaroo.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.758
He may go up on the curb
a couple times, but he'll get you there.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.032
Okay.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.270
Thanks for clearing that up.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.272
l'll get it.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.436
There's a two hour wait
for Space Mountain.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.519
-Hi, Mrs. Harper.
-Oh, dear lord.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.432
Hey, Kandi,
l got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.999
Sweet.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.072
Kandi, maybe you'd like to go
put some clothes on.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.596
-Why?
-Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.917
l just don't think that outfit
is appropriate for Jake.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.278
Oh, l agree.
He would look ridiculous in this.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.468
Can you get Alan for me?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.756
-He's not back from work yet.
-He's not?

08:08.920 --> 08:12.629
-Then what are you doing here?
-l live here now. Didn't Alan tell you?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.756
No, he did not.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.878
-Charlie, l wanna talk to you.
-Good to know.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.519
Charlie, get over here.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.510
lt was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.112
What in God's name
does she see in him?

08:29.600 --> 08:33.229
Well, l don't have all the details,
Mrs. Harper.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.630
But apparently
when he's not being emasculated. . .

08:35.799 --> 08:38.597
. . .and demoralized on a daily basis,
he's quite the lover.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.354
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what they say.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.431
Your average man's
like a good field mule.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.194
lf you don't beat him,
he'll keep plowing all day long.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.109
-Nobody says that.
-You're hard to fool.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.632
Look, l don't mean to be rude,
but l'm tired of talking to you.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.470
Had an interesting chat
with your ex-wife.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.949
Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner?

09:08.160 --> 09:11.470
-l like her.
-Why?

09:12.520 --> 09:14.033
Why?

09:15.360 --> 09:17.316
Well, unlike most ex-wives
l've known. . .

09:17.480 --> 09:20.392
. . .she's never tried to run me over
with her car.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.634
Okay, new dinner conversation.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.074
Jake, how was school?

09:26.240 --> 09:29.391
l don't think this conversation'll
make you any happier, Dad.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.599
-What now?
-We had a surprise test today.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.311
-And?
-l was really surprised.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.397
So, in other words,
you weren't prepared.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.994
You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.838
New conversation?

09:45.160 --> 09:48.357
Jake, what are we gonna do?
You've really fallen behind this year.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.796
l know. l think it's a delayed reaction
to your divorce.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.594
-Oh?
-Yeah.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.594
lt took a while, but my teachers have
finally stopped feeling sorry for me.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.389
You know, l'm a child of divorce too,
Jake.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.120
Really? How old were you
when your parents split up?

10:04.280 --> 10:06.748
-Twenty-two.
-But you're 22 now.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.717
Twenty-two and a half.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.440
Boy, what l'd give to be 22 again.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.469
New subject?

10:15.640 --> 10:19.713
No, no, no more conversation. Jake,
if you're finished, go do your homework.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.995
l'm gonna need help.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.879
-You don't need help, you need to focus.
-l'll help you.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.712
Do you know anything
about geometry?

10:25.880 --> 10:29.953
Well, l know it's what you say
when you turn into a tree.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.918
Get it? Gee, l'm a tree.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.309
Good one.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.359
Thanks.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.231
Boy, l hope when they get to Oz
the wizard has two brains to give out.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.910
And speaking of out,
when's Kandi leaving?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.430
-You don't have to worry.
-Because?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.113
l have a plan.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.596
Alan, if history has taught
us anything. . .

10:51.760 --> 10:54.513
. . .it's that both those statements
cannot be true.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.079
lt's very simple.
You give a man a fish, he eats for a day.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.231
You teach him to fish,
he eats forever.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.029
Okay, okay, in that example
is Kandi the man or the fish?

11:04.920 --> 11:06.035
l found her a job.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.875
She'll be able to afford her own place
and she won't depend on me anymore.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.234
Where is she working?

11:11.840 --> 11:15.071
-She's gonna be my receptionist.
-That's your plan?

11:15.240 --> 11:19.279
Why it's brilliant.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.150
What, what?
She's attractive, she's friendly. . .

11:22.320 --> 11:24.834
. . .and she's more than capable
of answering the phones.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.434
You hear the expression
''don't crap where you eat''?

11:27.600 --> 11:31.388
Well, you, my friend, are dropping
plunkies all over the dessert cart.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.310
-Okay, you have a better solution?
-No, no, no.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.710
No, it's your girlfriend,
your office, your life.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.871
Screw it up however you think best.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.432
l'll get it. l'm expecting a call.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.079
Hello?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.109
Kandi, that's the TV remote.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.311
Hello?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.199
Hello?

12:02.360 --> 12:05.033
Have you thought of teaching
a fish to answer your phones?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.359
Hello?

12:13.880 --> 12:15.472
-Staying in tonight?
-Yep.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.232
-Giving up on the ladies, huh?
-Yep.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.675
-Not even gonna try?
-Nope.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.076
You know, l got a niece in the joint.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.516
She doesn't look like much,
but she does get conjugal visits.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.629
l don't think so.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.236
Hold on, l might have a copy
of her mug shot. Here.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.033
She looks a little wall-eyed. . .

12:33.200 --> 12:36.795
. . .but that's because they had to
use a Taser to get her out of the shed.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.478
-The shed?
-She was running a meth lab.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.074
But you gotta admit,
she is nice and slender.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.078
-Thanks, but pass.
-Think about it.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.196
Visiting days
are Wednesdays and Fridays.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.874
But if you decide to go,
be a sport, take her a pie.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.470
-Right.
-Make it something chewy.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.349
The prison dentist set her up
with some real nice teeth.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.439
Okay.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.795
Now this isn't my lamp.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.071
What happened to my lamp?

13:26.880 --> 13:29.075
Unless this is my lamp.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.712
Yeah, this is my lamp.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.713
l bought this lamp to go
with my couch.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.553
My tan couch.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.628
Worst day of my life.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.836
Yeah, well, it was no picnic
for me either.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.753
-l don't know who you are anymore.
-You wanna know who l am?

13:45.920 --> 13:49.515
l'm the idiot paying you $ 1 0 an hour to
miss phone calls. Nap in the bathroom.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.477
Use my x-ray machine
on Mexican food.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.473
Well, l wanted to know
what's inside a chimichanga.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.949
lf you didn't know,
why'd you order it?

13:57.120 --> 13:58.872
Because it's fun to say chimichanga.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.790
Chimichanga. See?

14:03.960 --> 14:07.077
So, how was work?

14:07.240 --> 14:09.356
Horrible.
All he did was boss me around:

14:09.520 --> 14:12.353
''Do this, do that, wake up. ''

14:13.360 --> 14:15.635
Maybe that's because l'm your boss.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.995
A stupid, stinky boss.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.555
Anybody wanna know
about my problems?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.991
lt was supposed
to be Sloppy Joes for lunch.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.469
But instead they had fish sticks.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.839
Well, it ruined my day.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.150
No, no, no, l'll get it.
That's what l do.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.675
That's all l'm good for.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.718
Hello? Oh, fudge.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.350
Picture an entire day of this.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.632
With six lines.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.835
Hello?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.991
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.674
Oh, great. Kandi, Kandi,
give me the phone, give me--

14:55.840 --> 14:57.273
Back off buck-o.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.629
Was your ex-husband
always such a control freak?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.870
She says you were.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.554
You know what he did today?

15:05.720 --> 15:07.950
Kandi, you don't have
to get into that with her.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.680
She says she wants to know.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.474
Well, first of all at the office he tried
to make me call him Dr. Harper all day.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.473
And when l forgot he yelled at me.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.908
What?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.071
Chiropractors aren't really doctors.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.916
You liar.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.076
l so get why you dumped him.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.592
-Hey, Alan?
-What?

15:34.760 --> 15:37.035
ls this a new lamp?

15:37.240 --> 15:40.516
l would like that so much,
Mrs. Harper.

15:40.680 --> 15:44.116
Okay, l will call you Judith.
Great, l'll see you there.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.708
See her where?

15:46.880 --> 15:49.235
We're going out for a drink
and a little girl talk.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.992
Girl talk with my ex-wife?

15:51.160 --> 15:54.789
Her name is Judith,
Mr. ''l'm not a doctor'' Harper.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.113
Don't wait up.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.078
You just crapped
where you used to eat.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.118
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.510
-What are you doing up so late?
-What time is it?

16:17.160 --> 16:18.229
lt's 3 a.m.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.518
Oh, well then, l got my eight hours.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.555
What are you doing,
waiting up for Kandi?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.358
Oh, no, no, no. l couldn't sleep.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.750
So l thought l'd read a little.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.239
A furniture catalog?

16:34.480 --> 16:35.754
l like furniture.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.357
-Just looking at the pictures, huh?
-What are you getting at, Charlie?

16:40.520 --> 16:41.839
l think you buy things.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.310
l think you bought this lamp.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.472
-That lamp was here when l moved in.
-Oh, really?

16:50.640 --> 16:54.428
Charlie, l'm afraid that this dry streak
is starting to affect your mind.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.996
Maybe you're right.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.833
Sure, this is my lamp.
l've had it for years.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.151
-The table it's on is new.
-l knew it.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.915
We don't wanna wake up
Mr. Alan Hitler.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.230
No, no, Osama bin Alan.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.237
-Busted.
-What the hell is going on here?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.078
The hell what is going on here. . .

17:22.240 --> 17:25.073
. . .is that l need an advance
on my ''amilony. ''

17:26.200 --> 17:29.590
-Why?
-To pay Estefan, our limo driver.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.193
You took a limo?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.634
We couldn't find our cars. . .

17:32.800 --> 17:36.759
. . .and we spent all our money
on JELL-O shots, and chimichangas.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.279
All right, all right.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.318
Kandi, you need to go to bed.
We have to get up early for work.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.630
No, we don't. Because l quit.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.910
Why don't we talk
about this in the morning?

17:48.960 --> 17:51.474
All right, Judith,
here is you're ''amilony. ''

17:52.200 --> 17:54.077
-Thank you.
-Go home.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.434
And Kandi, go to bed.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.515
l do not wish to live with you
any furthermore.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.359
-What?
-l have been invited. . .

18:00.520 --> 18:03.432
. . .to stay with my good friend Judith.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.676
Come on, l'll help you
pack your things.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.434
Did you ever notice how much
he sweats during sex?

18:12.960 --> 18:14.552
Well, good for you.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.631
Good for me?
How is this good for me?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.598
-You got Kandi out of the house.
-l didn't want Kandi out.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.990
And l didn't want her
moving in with my ex-wife.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.469
Oh, right.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.755
Okay then, good for me.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.750
-Harper?
-Here.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.318
l'm gonna have to check your pie.

18:48.880 --> 18:49.995
Rhubarb.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.628
Oh, my girls like rhubarb.

18:56.280 --> 19:00.671
Okay, inmate 37059.
Down the hall, third door on the left.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.037
There's a button by the bed.
Push it if she gets violent.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.398
Thank you.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.238
-lt won't open.
-Try it again.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.235
Boy, you really are
having a dry streak, aren't you?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.157
Oh, God.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.589
l can't even get laid
in a women's prison.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.236
-Hi, are you Alan?
-No, l'm his brother, Charlie.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.391
Oh, well, l'm looking for Kandi.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.153
She told me she was living here.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.199
Actually, she moved.
lt's a very funny story.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.635
-Are you a friend?
-l'm her mother.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.837
Come on in and l'll see if l can find
a forwarding address.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.114
Thank you.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.195
Chimichanga.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.873
-Beautiful place.
-Thank you.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.076
l see where Kandi
gets her good looks.

20:07.240 --> 20:11.153
Thanks, unfortunately she gets
her brains from her moron father.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.273
Oh, right, you're recently divorced.
Would you like a drink?

20:16.880 --> 20:18.074
l would love one.

20:19.560 --> 20:24.998
Great. Why don't you step out
on to the deck, and l'll be right there.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.875
Good news,
it's raining out on my deck.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.632
Say what?

20:31.800 --> 20:33.711
The dry streak is over.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.078
So, what am l supposed to do
with this pie?
