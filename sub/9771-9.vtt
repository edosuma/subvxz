09:50.006 --> 09:51.173
- Yeah!

09:51.257 --> 09:52.883
- You got it!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.385
[cheering]

09:54.468 --> 09:56.262
- I'm gonna get out!

09:56.345 --> 09:57.722
I got it!

09:58.431 --> 10:01.934
You just wait and see!

10:02.018 --> 10:03.561
I'm gonna get out of this!

10:18.576 --> 10:19.035
[cheering]

10:19.118 --> 10:21.495
- Thank you.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.458
- You see?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.710
ALL: Whoa!

10:27.793 --> 10:30.838
[cheering]

10:30.921 --> 10:32.923
- Thanks.
Tell your friends.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.843
- He's letting kids
throw tomatoes at him?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.261
- For a dollar apiece.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.264
- That's horrible.
Can I borrow a dollar?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.684
STUDENTS: Ohh!

10:43.768 --> 10:45.186
- I've never seen anyone
so desperate for money.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.688
- It's 'cause he doesn't know
how to do anything

10:47.772 --> 10:49.023
without money.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.399
He's never had to do
anything for himself.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.026
- Hey, c'mon,
please don't aim for the face.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.653
STUDENTS: Whoo!

10:54.737 --> 10:55.905
- Yeah!

10:55.988 --> 10:57.865
- Okay, we have to help him.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.158
- Why should we help him?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.409
- He wouldn't help us.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.078
- Yeah, but we're good people.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.914
- Yeah, I am a good person.

11:04.997 --> 11:05.414
- Hey, hey, one at a time!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.750
C'mon!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.835
[cheering]

11:17.134 --> 11:19.053
- One, two, three!

11:19.136 --> 11:21.555
[grunting]

11:25.518 --> 11:28.604
[laughing]

11:28.687 --> 11:29.146
I'm out and about!

11:29.230 --> 11:33.734
[applause]

11:33.818 --> 11:35.111
- You cheated.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.320
- How'd I cheat?

11:36.404 --> 11:37.279
- You just smashed the chair!

11:37.363 --> 11:39.698
- Am I out of the ropes,

11:39.782 --> 11:41.158
or am I out of the ropes?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.743
- Did he cheat?

11:42.827 --> 11:43.744
- I feel yes.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.121
- All right, look,

11:45.204 --> 11:46.956
if you still don't believe
I can free myself

11:47.039 --> 11:49.083
from any ropes,
any knots you got,

11:49.166 --> 11:52.086
then let's go again.
Any time.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.379
- Okay. We will go again.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.047
- You know my digits.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.800
[laughing]

11:57.883 --> 12:01.303
- You want I should get
a book on knots?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.848
- No. I have a better idea.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.266
Come with me.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.145
- Oh, look, a rock.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.479
- You have enough rocks!

12:10.563 --> 12:12.106
- Ohh!

12:12.940 --> 12:14.400
- Okay, first you're gonna

12:14.483 --> 12:15.943
wash your whites in hot water,

12:16.026 --> 12:17.611
then your colors in warm water.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.654
- Colors in hot...

12:18.737 --> 12:19.697
- Colors in warm.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.531
- Warm, right.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.033
- Okay, now fill this cup up

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
to the little mark here
with detergent.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.328
- Which one, safe or best?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.205
- Either, doesn't matter.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.136
- Now what?

12:42.219 --> 12:43.971
- Go listen to music.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.097
I'll do your laundry.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.849
- Right.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.572
- Ugh!
Ugh!

13:01.655 --> 13:02.781
- There.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.866
- All right, now...

13:03.949 --> 13:05.367
hair dryer in your left hand,

13:05.451 --> 13:06.911
brush in your right.

13:06.994 --> 13:07.328
- Got it.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.163
- Cool.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.331
Now just brush and blow.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.208
I'll be back in ten.
- Okay.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.017
- You done?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.310
- Somethin' went wrong.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.853
- Well, how'd you--

13:32.937 --> 13:33.479
you don't--

13:33.562 --> 13:35.898
just let me do it.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.414
- Just put your fingers on the
home keys like I showed you.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.585
- Okay. Now what?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.255
- Now type, "The tiger chased

13:59.338 --> 14:01.215
the bunny into its hole."

14:01.298 --> 14:04.218
- Okay, um...

14:04.301 --> 14:07.513
"T"..."T"...is there a "T"?

14:07.596 --> 14:08.973
- Yes, there's a "T."

14:09.056 --> 14:11.100
why would they make
a keyboard without a "T"?

14:11.183 --> 14:11.934
Look, it's right there

14:12.017 --> 14:13.727
between the "R" and the "Y."

14:13.811 --> 14:14.979
- "R"...

14:15.062 --> 14:16.146
- Just move.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.064
I'll type the paper for you.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.361
- Hurry, okay?

14:28.951 --> 14:32.454
- You're a little late.
- Sorry.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.539
- I thought maybe
you weren't gonna show

14:33.622 --> 14:35.040
'cause you realized I can

14:35.124 --> 14:37.251
escape from any knots you got.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.961
- We'll see. Mark?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.219
Hello, Mr. Billiam.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.262
- It's not "Bill-ee-um".

14:48.345 --> 14:49.513
It is "Billyum."

14:49.597 --> 14:51.974
Two syllables. Thank you.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.310
- Isn't he the lower school
history teacher?

14:54.393 --> 14:57.146
- On weekdays. On weekends,

14:57.229 --> 14:59.315
I'm troop master Kenny.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.274
- He's the wilderness troop's

15:00.357 --> 15:02.818
number one expert
on tying knots.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.154
- Thank you
for recognizing that.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.989
- So, you're pretty good

15:07.072 --> 15:08.282
with the knot-tying, huh?

15:08.365 --> 15:10.159
- Oh, I can tie
over 350 unique knots,

15:10.242 --> 15:15.289
including the everlasting
German pretzel-twist.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.542
- Still feeling confident,
Michael?

15:19.835 --> 15:21.337
- Sit.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.174
- Let's get it on!

15:36.810 --> 15:37.936
- Logan's laundry.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.439
- I can't believe
I'm transporting

15:40.522 --> 15:41.940
Logan Reese's underpants.

15:42.024 --> 15:42.858
Ugh!

15:42.941 --> 15:44.360
- Yeah, well if you're really

15:44.443 --> 15:46.236
in the mood for fun,
try typing up his

15:46.320 --> 15:47.363
26-page history report.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.198
- Why'd he have to buy
that stupid car

15:49.281 --> 15:50.324
and lose all his money?

15:50.407 --> 15:51.325
I liked him so much better

15:51.408 --> 15:52.284
when he was rich and obnoxious.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.827
[sighs]

15:53.911 --> 15:55.371
- Oh, here.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.789
- Whose wallet?

15:56.872 --> 15:57.873
- Logan's.

15:57.956 --> 15:58.374
He left it in his pants.

15:58.457 --> 16:02.044
- Oh.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.004
Well, this is weird.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.966
He's got over 200 bucks
in here.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.429
And his United Express
credit card.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.850
- I thought his dad
took that away.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.108
[groaning]

16:24.191 --> 16:25.734
- Yes. Struggle,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.987
though it will do you no good.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.281
- Let us know when
you're ready to give up.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.741
- Oh, don't you worry about me.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.202
I'll get outta this so fast,

16:35.285 --> 16:36.620
it'll make your mama spin.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.205
- Enjoy.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.623
- Okay.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.627
- Ooh, Michael!

16:43.711 --> 16:44.670
Have you heard the song I wrote?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.964
I can sing it for you.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.090
- No, please!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.425
What did I ever do to you?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.427
- ♪ You can sip it

16:51.510 --> 16:53.595

17:01.520 --> 17:05.441

17:05.523 --> 17:06.608

17:06.692 --> 17:08.152
to read another person's email.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.278
- You want me to stop?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.279
- No, read it!

17:10.362 --> 17:12.364
- Okay. Um...

17:12.448 --> 17:14.282
ooh, here's the last e-mail

17:14.366 --> 17:15.534
to Logan from his father.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.286
- What's it say?
- Hurry, read it!

17:17.368 --> 17:18.454
- I'm clicking.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.913
Okay, it says, um...

17:19.997 --> 17:23.375
"Logan, I know the last few days

17:23.459 --> 17:25.377
"without money have been
difficult for you.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.753
"After we talked on the phone

17:26.837 --> 17:29.757
"last night, I decided
you've learned your lesson,

17:29.840 --> 17:31.258
"so I'm going to send your ATM

17:31.341 --> 17:34.094
and credit cards back tomorrow."

17:34.178 --> 17:35.262
- What?

17:35.345 --> 17:37.389
- When did he get that email?

17:37.473 --> 17:38.223
- Over a week ago.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.350
- He's had his money back

17:40.434 --> 17:41.810
for over a week?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.854
And he's been letting me
blow-dry his stupid hair

17:43.937 --> 17:44.772
every day?

17:44.855 --> 17:46.231
- And letting me
do his laundry?

17:46.315 --> 17:48.400
- Do you know how many words
I typed for the guy?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.485
- I am gonna kill him!

17:49.568 --> 17:51.320
I am gonna kill that boy!

17:51.403 --> 17:52.654
- This does call for revenge.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.655
- What are we gonna do?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.784
We need to do
bad things to him.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.081
- I don't feel good about this.

18:03.165 --> 18:03.999
I've been collecting

18:04.082 --> 18:05.417
these coins since I was five.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.543
- You'll get
your collection back.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.419
We promise.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.796
- I better.
- You will.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.005
- Just do exactly

18:10.088 --> 18:12.382
what we told you,
and don't let--

18:12.466 --> 18:14.218
- Hey, shh, shh!

18:14.301 --> 18:16.887
Oh, c'mon, man. Please?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.555
- Sorry, Chase, I can't do it.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.348
- He said he'd get you

18:19.431 --> 18:21.308
the money in a couple of weeks.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.684
- I thought we were friends.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.186
- This is business.
- What's business?

18:24.269 --> 18:27.189
- Firewire wants to sell
his coin collection...

18:27.272 --> 18:28.482
- And Chase's uncle wants
to buy it...

18:28.565 --> 18:30.234
- But he's in Amsterdam
till the end of the month.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.320
You can have the money
in two weeks.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.363
- What's the big deal

18:34.446 --> 18:35.155
about a box of nerd coins?

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
- Uh, this is the big deal.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.621
A double eagle gold dollar...

18:42.704 --> 18:44.540
- From 1933.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.583
- So?

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
- So it's super-rare

18:47.793 --> 18:49.419
and worth like
over 100,000--

18:49.503 --> 18:51.672
- $150,000.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.923
- Yeah, but I'll sell it
for 80,000

18:53.006 --> 18:54.716
'cause my parents need
the money, like now.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.386
- They can wait two weeks.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.679
C'mon.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.181
- You swear your uncle's
gonna give me a check

19:01.265 --> 19:02.933
for 80,000 in two weeks?

19:03.016 --> 19:05.477
- Yep, as soon as
he's back in the states.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.229
- I'll give you 100,000

19:07.312 --> 19:09.064
for it right now.

19:09.147 --> 19:09.940
- What?

19:10.023 --> 19:10.941
- You don't have any money!

19:11.024 --> 19:12.276
- Yeah, don't listen to him.

19:12.359 --> 19:12.693
His daddy cut him off.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.653
- Yep...

19:14.736 --> 19:18.532
and then he cut me back on.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.867
100 grand
for the coin collection.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.327
I can get a cash advance,
and you can have the money

19:22.411 --> 19:23.245
in an hour.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.501
- You what?
- Don't be grumpy.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.502
This is great news!

19:30.586 --> 19:33.547
- You spend $100,000
of my money

19:33.630 --> 19:35.048
without my permission?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.717
- The coins are worth
at least that.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.510
Probably a lot more.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.554
- What do you know
about coins?

19:40.637 --> 19:42.764
- Sir, I know a great deal

19:42.848 --> 19:45.225
about coins and stamps and such.

19:45.309 --> 19:45.934
- Get the car.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.603
Logan, I will see you

19:47.686 --> 19:51.940
in 90 minutes!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.275
[dial tone]

19:56.528 --> 19:59.239
- Aww, why did I do this?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.409
Hey...hey...

20:02.492 --> 20:05.120
I been out here all night,
and I'm starving.

20:05.203 --> 20:07.581
Are you
gonna finish that corn dog?

20:07.664 --> 20:08.248
- No.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.584
- Really? Can I have it?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.669
- No.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.921
- [splutters]

20:14.004 --> 20:16.632
What would you do that for?

20:16.715 --> 20:20.260
Why? Why?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.268
- Hey, pop.
- Give it to me.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.061
- There's no reason
to be all mad.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.562
- We'll see. Chauncey.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.106
Which one?

20:37.402 --> 20:39.988
- What's it worth?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.449
- Well, that's difficult

20:42.532 --> 20:43.283
to determine, exactly.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.660
I'd say somewhere between

20:44.743 --> 20:48.664
50 and 75 cents.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.083
- You see?

20:51.166 --> 20:52.167
What?

20:52.250 --> 20:54.336
- This is a replica.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.213
- It's a fake?

20:56.296 --> 20:57.798
- Yes. Congratulations.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.634
You're a dip-wad.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.469
- Dad, listen, I --

21:02.552 --> 21:03.220
- Give me your credit card.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.806
- But, Dad!
- Now!

21:17.526 --> 21:19.611
Let's go, Chauncey.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.364
- Dip-wad.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.573
- But, Dad!

21:23.657 --> 21:24.366
I can't live without money!

21:24.449 --> 21:26.201
I--I was born to be rich!

21:26.284 --> 21:28.870
Please! I can't be
like other kids!

21:28.954 --> 21:31.081
It's disgusting!
Dad...

21:33.750 --> 21:36.336
[laughing]

21:43.385 --> 21:45.470
- We're gonna send his dad
all the money back, right?

21:45.554 --> 21:47.389
- 'Course we are.
- Yep.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.182
The whole 90,000.

21:49.266 --> 21:49.641
- It's 100,000.

21:49.725 --> 21:50.892

22:01.653 --> 22:03.780
Quinn?

22:05.532 --> 22:06.908
Del Figs?

22:06.992 --> 22:09.911
Troop master Kenny?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.539
Aww! This is bad!

22:14.499 --> 22:17.085
Help! I'm in a predicament!

22:17.169 --> 22:18.086
- Boo.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.838
- Oh! [panting]

22:19.921 --> 22:22.424
Listen, Mr. Billiam,

22:22.507 --> 22:24.801
I give. I'm done.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.344

22:26.428 --> 22:27.721
- Yeah. Please.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.097

22:31.850 --> 22:34.436
"you are the best knot-tyer

22:36.021 --> 22:38.690
- Troop master Kenny,

22:38.774 --> 22:41.777
you are the best knot-tyer

22:41.860 --> 22:43.528
