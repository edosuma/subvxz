00:05.986 --> 00:08.386
<i>The system lords are no longer.</i>

00:08.455 --> 00:11.322
You have become
a meaningless coalition...

00:11.391 --> 00:16.021
that cannot resist the power
of my master, Lord Ba'al.

00:23.670 --> 00:27.003
Your master has no honor.

00:27.074 --> 00:29.565
The system lords have
not weakened in their resolve.

00:29.643 --> 00:32.874
The Jaffa are weak-willed
and fallible.

00:32.946 --> 00:36.438
Is it any wonder they've begun
to doubt their faith in the gods?

00:36.516 --> 00:38.074
So many Goa'uld have fallen.

00:38.151 --> 00:41.746
Ba'al was wise
to send a representative.

00:41.822 --> 00:43.915
I would have killed him
with my own hands!

00:43.990 --> 00:46.481
Despite your ill will...

00:46.560 --> 00:50.462
Lord Ba'al wishes to extend
a most generous offer.

00:50.530 --> 00:52.088
In exchange
for your surrender...

00:52.165 --> 00:54.497
Ba'al will allow you
to keep your armies...

00:54.568 --> 00:58.060
and continue to administrate
your territories under his authority.

00:59.172 --> 01:01.402
You will be
permitted to live...

01:01.475 --> 01:04.535
so long as you bow before him
as the supreme commander...

01:04.611 --> 01:07.739
of the entire Goa'uld domain.

01:08.648 --> 01:11.776
Refusal to accept
the terms of this offer...

01:11.852 --> 01:14.218
will result in the resumption
of hostilities...

01:14.287 --> 01:17.415
and, ultimately, your death.

01:22.262 --> 01:23.923
Bring her.

01:24.998 --> 01:29.025
- What is the meaning of this?
- I should ask you the same thing.

01:38.378 --> 01:41.074
Major Samantha Carter.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.412
Actually, I'm a colonel now.

01:51.258 --> 01:53.886
Her cargo ship was intercepted
by my sentries...

01:53.960 --> 01:57.657
when it violated the proximity zone
around this station.

01:57.731 --> 02:02.293
I am well aware of your past relationship
with SG-1 and the Tauri.

02:02.369 --> 02:04.496
Would you have me believe that
her sudden appearance here...

02:04.571 --> 02:06.505
is nothing more
than mere coincidence?

02:12.512 --> 02:14.707
What are you doing here?

03:48.608 --> 03:51.634
- They are late.
- Or they're not coming.

03:51.711 --> 03:53.645
Were that the case,
Rak'nor would have sent word.

03:53.713 --> 03:55.112
If he were able to do so.

03:55.181 --> 03:57.775
Maybe we should reconsider
the mission.

03:57.851 --> 04:01.912
This is not an SGC mission.
Reconsidering is not an option.

04:03.356 --> 04:06.621
Look, I know the timing of these first
few surprise attacks is crucial, but-

04:06.693 --> 04:10.220
And we're just here as observers,
but right now...

04:10.297 --> 04:13.562
I'm observing the fact that if you take on
one of Amaterasu's mother ships...

04:13.633 --> 04:16.261
without proper backup,
you could get yourself killed.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.065
Us observers too.

04:18.138 --> 04:22.165
Many such attacks have been coordinated
simultaneously across the galaxy...

04:22.242 --> 04:24.574
each one designed to create
a strategic weakness...

04:24.644 --> 04:26.578
in the forces of the system lords.

04:26.646 --> 04:28.273
And if even one fails, I know-

04:28.348 --> 04:30.282
The rebelJaffa
have gone to great lengths...

04:30.350 --> 04:33.285
to acquire the security codes
currently being used by the system lords.

04:33.353 --> 04:36.584
If all goes according to plan, they will
believe we are allies, lower the shields.

04:36.656 --> 04:38.317
If all goes according to plan.

04:38.391 --> 04:41.292
Once the shields are lowered,
the Jaffa contingent aboard this vessel...

04:41.361 --> 04:45.491
should be sufficient to overwhelm
any initial resistance we may encounter.

04:45.565 --> 04:48.056
We have allies within the ranks
of Amaterasu's Jaffa...

04:48.134 --> 04:50.329
who will also help
facilitate our attacks.

04:50.403 --> 04:53.736
Once the others witness
the death of their false god...

04:53.807 --> 04:56.901
they will realize the truth
and join our ranks.

04:56.977 --> 05:00.413
Isn't the fact that we haven't heard
from Rak'nor kind of a bad sign?

05:07.187 --> 05:08.449
What is it?

05:08.521 --> 05:11.581
The ship's sensors have detected
a vessel closing in on our position.

05:12.492 --> 05:13.789
Ha'tak class.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.487
- Rak'nor?
- Unlikely.

05:15.562 --> 05:18.030
Rak'nor would have hailed
long before his approach.

05:18.098 --> 05:22.159
Then it has to be Amaterasu.
Shouldn't we get out of here?

05:25.438 --> 05:28.498
Teal'c, the odds are not in our favor.

05:28.575 --> 05:30.008
They never are.

05:34.781 --> 05:38.410
I am hailing them and transmitting
the security codes.

05:40.654 --> 05:42.019
They fired on us.

05:44.791 --> 05:47.817
- Shield strength is down 60%.
- How is that possible?

05:47.894 --> 05:49.156
What the hell did they hit us with?

05:52.165 --> 05:53.826
Returning fire.

06:00.874 --> 06:02.808
Our weapons are ineffective.

06:03.977 --> 06:06.070
We have lost shields.

06:06.146 --> 06:09.377
- Now can we get out of here?
- Navigational controls are not responding.

06:11.084 --> 06:14.349
- We must evacuate.
- Glider bay?

06:14.421 --> 06:16.355
We can use the rings
to the planet transport below...

06:16.423 --> 06:18.414
and escape through the Stargate.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.197
What is it?

06:36.309 --> 06:38.243
- That's not good.
- This way.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.628
Colonel Carter.

07:14.881 --> 07:17.850
Jack, we got a problem.
We need to talk.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.283
Hi. Hello. How are you?

07:20.353 --> 07:22.947
Long time no see.
What's doin'? What's up? Hey, buddy.

07:23.022 --> 07:25.456
I'm sorry, Jack.
It's good to see you again.

07:25.525 --> 07:27.117
Congratulations on your promotion.

07:28.561 --> 07:30.495
- Thanks.
- You deserve it.

07:30.563 --> 07:33.157
Yes, well-What's up?

07:33.233 --> 07:37.533
The Replicators. They've launched
an all-out attack on the Goa'uld.

07:37.604 --> 07:39.697
If the Goa'uld can't
find a way to stop them...

07:39.773 --> 07:43.334
the Replicators will easily
overrun our galaxy in a matter of weeks.

07:43.409 --> 07:45.809
Why didn't you say so?

07:48.314 --> 07:54.150
I'm sorry. You said we had a problem,
not a big galactic emergency.

08:02.962 --> 08:05.157
Our operatives have spent
the past several years...

08:05.231 --> 08:07.495
tagging as many Goa'uld ships
as possible...

08:07.567 --> 08:09.797
in an effort
to track their movements.

08:09.869 --> 08:13.100
Today, we have beacons
on more than a hundred mother ships...

08:13.173 --> 08:18.611
transmitting their location via subspace
to an encoded Tok'ra network.

08:18.678 --> 08:20.475
And this?

08:20.547 --> 08:24.074
It's a receiver that will allow me
to tap into the subspace network.

08:24.150 --> 08:26.277
We can keep tabs on Ba'al's fleet...

08:26.352 --> 08:29.116
see how their battle
with the Replicators is faring.

08:29.189 --> 08:32.784
We can also get up-to-the-minute Tok'ra
intelligence reports from our agents.

08:32.859 --> 08:35.794
You know, we could've used something
like this a long time ago.

08:35.862 --> 08:39.354
The high council never thought
they could trust you with it.

08:39.432 --> 08:41.525
What changed their mind?

08:41.601 --> 08:43.728
Nothing.
They don't know I took it.

08:45.805 --> 08:48.831
My relationship with the council
is still a little strained.

08:48.908 --> 08:51.672
It's not gonna get any better
if you keep stealing stuff.

08:52.979 --> 08:54.947
No complaints.
I'll take anything I can get-

08:55.014 --> 08:57.881
weapons, receivers, silverware.

09:03.456 --> 09:05.856
Each dot represents a Goa'uld ship.

09:05.925 --> 09:07.756
That's a lot of dots.

09:07.827 --> 09:11.661
That's just one small quadrant
of the galaxy. Watch.

09:29.115 --> 09:30.412
What just happened?

09:30.483 --> 09:33.077
The beacons stopped
transmitting their signals...

09:33.152 --> 09:35.143
likely meaning those ships
were either destroyed...

09:35.221 --> 09:37.348
or taken over by the Replicators.

09:37.423 --> 09:41.757
Battles like the one you just witnessed
are taking place across the galaxy.

09:41.828 --> 09:44.854
Several Goa'uld territories
are now entirely in Replicator hands.

09:50.603 --> 09:54.004
As I said, given the progress
of these battles...

09:54.073 --> 09:56.303
the Goa'uld will be wiped out
in a matter of weeks.

09:59.812 --> 10:04.272
You know, I have to admit-
I have some mixed feelings about this.

10:04.350 --> 10:08.912
Well, we all want to see the Goa'uld
stranglehold on the galaxy broken...

10:08.988 --> 10:12.151
but not if they're just gonna
be replaced by something worse.

10:12.225 --> 10:14.284
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

10:28.841 --> 10:30.866
Dad.

10:30.944 --> 10:33.435
Hey, kiddo.

10:33.513 --> 10:38.974
So, what the heck happened?
Didn't you guys have a ship?

10:44.624 --> 10:47.684
And by the way, where's Daniel?

10:50.396 --> 10:53.160
He was beamed away
before our very eyes.

10:53.232 --> 10:56.360
- By Replicators.
- Just Daniel?

10:56.436 --> 11:00.463
There's only one reason
I can think of- my duplicate.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.838
She knows the greatest threat
the Replicators have ever known...

11:02.909 --> 11:05.605
is the disrupter technology
that you built using Ancient knowledge.

11:05.678 --> 11:08.374
So? She's immune to that now.

11:08.448 --> 11:12.111
Yes, but Replicators always seek out
the most advanced technology.

11:12.185 --> 11:15.120
She may be worried that there's
other Ancient technology out there...

11:15.188 --> 11:17.383
that could be a threat to her
and the rest of the Replicators.

11:17.457 --> 11:20.984
Daniel Jackson had access to the knowledge
of the Ancients when he was ascended.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.994
I thought he didn't retain those memories.

11:23.062 --> 11:25.257
We don't know that for sure.
Daniel has remembered...

11:25.331 --> 11:27.595
certain things
from when he was ascended.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.192
She may think that everything
she needs to know about the Ancients...

11:30.269 --> 11:32.237
is buried in his subconscious.

11:32.305 --> 11:35.832
- If it is, she'll find it.
- Oy.

11:43.383 --> 11:46.375
The Tok'ra have operatives
in Ba'al's inner circle...

11:46.452 --> 11:49.182
including one of
his high-ranking lieutenants.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.382
According to the latest intelligence...

11:51.457 --> 11:53.425
the ranks of the Jaffa rebellion...

11:53.493 --> 11:56.894
are repledging their loyalty
to the Goa'uld by the thousands.

11:56.963 --> 11:58.897
But the Goa'uld are losing the war.

11:58.965 --> 12:01.763
Yeah. You'd think
that'd make them look weaker.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.997
The Jaffa have never seen
the likes of such creatures.

12:05.071 --> 12:08.268
Many could see these Replicators
as a plague...

12:08.341 --> 12:10.275
an evil punishment brought upon all...

12:10.343 --> 12:13.210
for daring to stray in their beliefs
and betray their gods.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.976
This situation has dealt
the Jaffa rebellion a serious blow.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.041
Even if we were to somehow
defeat the Replicators...

12:19.118 --> 12:21.416
the Goa'uld would
undoubtedly take credit...

12:21.487 --> 12:25.423
thereby solidifying Jaffa loyalty as well
as their belief in the Goa'uld as gods.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.956
I think the key phrase in there
was "somehow defeat the Replicators."

12:32.031 --> 12:34.158
We haven't had much luck, sir.

12:34.233 --> 12:37.566
The inert Replicator cells left behind by
my duplicate haven't given us any clues...

12:37.637 --> 12:39.764
as to how to fight
the immunity she's developed.

12:39.839 --> 12:42.034
As far as I know,
Thor hasn't made much progress...

12:42.108 --> 12:44.269
in modifying
the disrupter technology either.

12:46.012 --> 12:48.640
Well, let him know what's going on.

12:48.714 --> 12:50.648
And don't be afraid
to remind him that...

12:50.716 --> 12:53.742
we've saved his cute,
little gray bum several times.

12:59.725 --> 13:04.992
Years of effort all but undone
in a matter of days.

13:05.064 --> 13:09.125
It will now be almost impossible to turn
so many of our brothers back to our cause.

13:09.202 --> 13:11.397
Perhaps.
Yet there may be a way.

13:11.471 --> 13:16.738
Even if we can, I wonder,
will it make a difference?

13:16.809 --> 13:19.107
These machines are unlike
anything I have seen.

13:19.178 --> 13:21.806
We must proceed on the belief
that Colonel Carter and Thor...

13:21.881 --> 13:24.816
will devise a means
to destroy the Replicators.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.546
How, then, can we prevent
the Goa'uld from taking credit...

13:27.620 --> 13:30.783
and solidifying their position
as gods in the eyes of allJaffa?

13:30.857 --> 13:35.590
We must act now before
this conflict is resolved...

13:35.661 --> 13:39.427
win back the hearts and minds of those
who waver before they are lost to us.

13:39.499 --> 13:42.866
We must once and for all destroy
the Goa'uld image as gods forever.

13:42.935 --> 13:44.197
How?

13:45.705 --> 13:47.935
By capturing the temple at Dakara.

13:51.777 --> 13:54.177
Everything we have fought for
hangs in the balance.

13:55.882 --> 13:58.680
Yes, but Dakara-

13:58.751 --> 14:04.053
Capture it, and never again
will a Jaffa worship a false god.

14:07.894 --> 14:12.194
Sir. I'm sorry to bother you, but-

14:12.265 --> 14:14.699
I'm only gonna say this once, Carter.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.826
What happened to Daniel
was not your fault.

14:17.837 --> 14:21.295
She knows he may hold
key Ancient knowledge because of me.

14:21.374 --> 14:23.865
She's out there because of me.

14:23.943 --> 14:27.242
I gave her the means to counter the
only effective weapon we have against her.

14:27.313 --> 14:32.148
I also gave you permission to work
with her. It's not gonna change anything.

14:37.323 --> 14:41.919
Unless you're suggesting we use
that time machine to go back and fix it.

14:44.797 --> 14:47.527
No, sir. We all agreed
we would never do that.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.534
I mean, for all we know,
it could just make things worse.

14:51.504 --> 14:53.938
Sir, we're receiving
a message from Thor.

14:54.006 --> 14:56.873
He said he's ready to transport-

14:59.579 --> 15:00.841
You were saying?

15:02.615 --> 15:04.242
Never mind.

15:11.457 --> 15:13.186
Hello again, Samantha Carter.

15:13.259 --> 15:15.227
Hi, Thor.

15:15.294 --> 15:17.660
I have already transported
your research...

15:17.730 --> 15:21.188
and the remains of
the human-form Replicator to this lab.

15:21.267 --> 15:24.498
We may continue our work from here.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.970
Any progress on your end?

15:27.039 --> 15:30.270
I have yet to isolate the cipher
the human-form Replicator introduced...

15:30.343 --> 15:32.743
to render the disrupter
weapon ineffective.

15:32.812 --> 15:36.407
Well, given the situation, I think
it's time to take more drastic steps.

15:36.482 --> 15:40.680
You are suggesting we attempt
to trigger a subspace connection...

15:40.753 --> 15:44.018
between the remains of the arm
and the rest of the Replicators...

15:44.090 --> 15:47.457
so that we may search for the cipher
among their communications data.

15:47.526 --> 15:49.084
Too wild and crazy?

15:49.161 --> 15:52.221
In order to do that,
we must reactivate the cells.

15:53.299 --> 15:54.596
I know.

15:58.337 --> 16:00.567
What makes this place so special?

16:00.640 --> 16:03.837
The temple at Dakara
is sacred to allJaffa.

16:03.909 --> 16:05.774
It is rich in historical significance.

16:05.845 --> 16:09.042
Legend tells it is the place
where Anubis rose from the dead.

16:09.115 --> 16:11.242
<i>It is also the site
of the first prim'ta ritual.</i>

16:11.317 --> 16:15.811
It is that rite of passage that
has bonded us in servitude ever since.

16:15.888 --> 16:20.382
For thousands of years, the Jaffa have
viewed Dakara as the holiest of sites...

16:20.459 --> 16:22.723
the very cradle of our existence.

16:22.795 --> 16:27.630
It is the place where the Goa'uld first
gave Jaffa their strength and longevity.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.498
And you really think this place
is gonna make a difference?

16:30.569 --> 16:34.266
Seizing control of the temple there
would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt...

16:34.340 --> 16:37.138
the Goa'uld do not possess
the power of the gods.

16:37.209 --> 16:41.612
Even the most stubborn Jaffa would have
to question his loyalty to the Goa'uld.

16:43.215 --> 16:45.149
There has to be a catch...

16:45.217 --> 16:48.550
or you guys would've
done this a long time ago.

16:48.621 --> 16:51.351
Dakara is deep within
Ba'al's territory...

16:51.424 --> 16:54.291
and under normal circumstances,
it is heavily guarded.

16:54.360 --> 16:59.195
With Ba'al's forces deployed throughout
the galaxy battling the Replicators...

16:59.265 --> 17:02.393
the temple is more vulnerable now
than it has ever been.

17:02.468 --> 17:04.663
Still, our success depends
on the element of surprise...

17:04.737 --> 17:06.671
and the use of
the entire rebel fleet.

17:07.740 --> 17:09.298
Listen to me, O'Neill.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.003
This war must be fought
on two fronts.

17:12.078 --> 17:15.673
We will reignite the uprising
and conquer our oppressors...

17:15.748 --> 17:19.479
while you find the means
to stop these Replicators.

17:19.552 --> 17:23.318
Let us each fight the enemy
we know best.

17:51.217 --> 17:52.684
Hello, Daniel.

17:55.688 --> 17:57.815
What the hell do you want?

17:57.890 --> 18:00.154
You have information that I need.

18:05.498 --> 18:07.864
Okay, what do you wanna know?

18:07.933 --> 18:09.924
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

18:10.002 --> 18:12.061
Oh, no, it is that simple.

18:12.138 --> 18:14.072
You know,
if it's all the same with you...

18:14.140 --> 18:16.074
I'd rather not do
the hand-on-the-head things.

18:18.377 --> 18:20.072
Honestly, I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

18:20.146 --> 18:21.875
Honesty is not the problem.

18:27.386 --> 18:30.822
Unfortunately, to get what I need...

18:30.890 --> 18:32.824
we're going to have to dig
a little deeper.

18:38.297 --> 18:39.958
Shall we begin?

18:49.575 --> 18:51.941
What you are proposing is madness.

18:52.011 --> 18:54.502
Dakara cannot be taken.

19:01.554 --> 19:04.455
Tolok, you have not spoken.

19:09.562 --> 19:11.757
Aron is right.

19:11.831 --> 19:14.459
We would be sacrificing
countless men and ships...

19:14.533 --> 19:16.967
on a fruitless mission.

19:17.036 --> 19:19.527
We should be concentrating
on the greater threat...

19:19.605 --> 19:22.836
the Replicators,
before they destroy us all.

19:22.908 --> 19:25.468
Jaffa, hear me.

19:26.879 --> 19:30.042
I have engaged the Replicators
in battle many times.

19:30.115 --> 19:34.017
Believe me when I say they cannot
be defeated by conventional means.

19:34.086 --> 19:38.318
You have faced them in the past
and won.

19:38.390 --> 19:43.259
Indeed.
Yet never in such numbers.

19:43.329 --> 19:47.823
Those of you who choose to engage the
Replicators in battle will not survive.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.959
Teal'c is right.

19:50.035 --> 19:52.595
We must fight only those battles
we know we can win.

19:52.671 --> 19:55.868
Yet you propose
an equally impossible task.

19:55.941 --> 20:00.173
With Ba'al otherwise occupied,
now is the time to strike.

20:00.246 --> 20:04.376
No free Jaffa has ever set foot
in the temple and lived.

20:04.450 --> 20:07.817
And that is precisely why
we must go there.

20:07.887 --> 20:11.379
If we succeed,
many will rejoin our cause.

20:11.457 --> 20:12.719
If we succeed.

20:12.791 --> 20:17.819
Were the circumstances different,
I may feel the same as you, brother.

20:17.897 --> 20:21.628
But the situation has changed.
We must act now...

20:21.700 --> 20:26.797
or our children will know no future,
let alone the taste of freedom.

20:27.806 --> 20:31.003
I believe there is wisdom
in these words.

20:31.076 --> 20:35.843
However, you are aware
that if we fail...

20:35.915 --> 20:39.578
it will effectively mean
the end of the rebellion.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.552
Are you prepared...

20:41.620 --> 20:46.887
to risk our entire cause
on this one action?

20:50.129 --> 20:51.357
Indeed I am.

20:56.635 --> 21:00.571
So, what say you?

21:04.343 --> 21:06.709
I say we take Dakara.

21:10.349 --> 21:11.816
So be it.

21:16.789 --> 21:20.816
<i>Five more regions belonging to Ba'al
have fallen in the past 2 4 hours.</i>

21:20.893 --> 21:23.123
He's not putting up
much of a fight, is he?

21:23.195 --> 21:25.390
He's making a typical
Goa'uld mistake.

21:25.464 --> 21:28.729
He's defending territory
at the expense of resources.

21:31.403 --> 21:35.271
We can send him a message through
the undercover Tok'ra in his midst.

21:35.341 --> 21:37.309
We could suggest
a change in strategy.

21:38.811 --> 21:41.006
- Like what?
- Typically...

21:41.080 --> 21:44.481
the Replicators are patient and
slow-moving when not being engaged.

21:44.550 --> 21:48.418
If Ba'al stops aggressively
fighting them and pulls back...

21:48.487 --> 21:50.921
it may give Sam more time
to come up with a solution.

21:50.990 --> 21:53.788
- Forget that.
- Look.

21:53.859 --> 21:57.522
There goes another one.

21:57.596 --> 22:01.999
Jack, he's thinking like a system lord
defending himself against another Goa'uld.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.001
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.

22:04.069 --> 22:06.936
And if he retreats, where do you think
he's gonna fall back to?

22:07.006 --> 22:09.031
You're worried about Teal'c
and the rebelJaffa.

22:09.108 --> 22:12.703
They're counting on Ba'al's fleet being
too busy to even care about anything else.

22:12.778 --> 22:15.941
The Jaffa rebellion
has already failed.

22:16.015 --> 22:18.848
We can't risk the fate
of the galaxy...

22:18.917 --> 22:21.511
on one long-shot chance
to revive it.

22:23.055 --> 22:25.956
Is that Jacob talking
or is that Selmak?

22:26.025 --> 22:28.585
Jack, I'm sorry...

22:28.661 --> 22:31.357
but the more ships
Ba'al sends out to fight...

22:31.430 --> 22:35.025
the faster the Replicators assimilate them
into their own armada.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.796
Their numbers are growing
exponentially.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.804
If we don't do something about it...

22:39.872 --> 22:43.808
by the time we do come up with a weapon
to use against them, it may be too late.

22:44.977 --> 22:48.208
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

22:56.288 --> 22:59.553
- Now what have you got, Walter?
- Some kind of-

23:05.497 --> 23:07.158
Stand down, boys.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.730
Ba'al, buddy.
We were just talking about you.

23:11.804 --> 23:14.068
All good.

23:14.139 --> 23:17.404
By now, you are aware
of the Replicator threat in our galaxy...

23:17.476 --> 23:19.410
and that my fleet
has engaged them in battle.

23:19.478 --> 23:23.539
There's been a little
chit and chat...

23:23.615 --> 23:26.015
around the watercooler.

23:26.085 --> 23:27.347
How's that going?

23:27.419 --> 23:28.943
We're holding them at bay
for the moment.

23:29.021 --> 23:33.754
However, they are a more formidable force
than I first anticipated.

23:33.826 --> 23:36.761
Yeah. Pesky little buggers,
aren't they?

23:36.829 --> 23:40.390
I am aware that the Asgard have previously
fought the Replicators effectively.

23:41.834 --> 23:44.769
More or less.
I don't like to toot my own horn, but-

23:44.837 --> 23:48.500
I am aware that
you assisted the Asgard.

23:52.811 --> 23:54.108
Yes?

23:54.179 --> 23:57.979
I wish to know what means
you possess to fight this scourge.

24:01.253 --> 24:05.952
I'm sorry. We must have had
a bad connection there for a second.

24:06.024 --> 24:09.824
It almost sounded like
you were asking me for help.

24:10.996 --> 24:14.295
The Replicators are
a threat to everyone...

24:14.366 --> 24:18.700
including the countless humans who
populate worlds throughout this galaxy.

24:18.771 --> 24:23.731
Now I propose that we work together
to defeat our common enemy.

24:23.809 --> 24:28.269
My. This is an occasion.

24:30.015 --> 24:32.745
You know that bitter taste
in your throat...

24:32.818 --> 24:36.652
that's kind of
wrapped around your uvula?

24:36.722 --> 24:38.656
That's what's left of your pride.

24:38.724 --> 24:41.852
Perhaps you could curb
your amusement for a moment.

24:41.927 --> 24:47.263
If we're going to work together, the
first thing we should discuss is strategy.

24:47.332 --> 24:50.460
Now your attempts at meeting
the Replicators head-on...

24:50.536 --> 24:52.470
are only going to result-

24:52.538 --> 24:56.304
- What?
- I got it.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.309
I've got a better idea.

24:58.377 --> 25:01.005
Instead of helping you...

25:01.079 --> 25:05.573
why don't we sit back
and watch you get your ass kicked?

25:05.651 --> 25:08.677
That way, you'll be dead,
and we'll be glad.

25:08.754 --> 25:11.086
You cannot be serious.

25:11.156 --> 25:14.489
Yes, I can.
I just choose not to...

25:14.560 --> 25:16.790
some of the time.

25:16.862 --> 25:18.853
With your insolence,
you are dooming not just your world...

25:18.931 --> 25:20.956
but all of humanity.

25:21.033 --> 25:22.557
I think big.

25:31.643 --> 25:33.372
What the hell was that?

25:34.446 --> 25:36.107
I'm sorry, Jacob...

25:37.716 --> 25:41.049
but I'm just not quite ready
to sacrifice Teal'c.

25:55.567 --> 25:57.501
The process is complete.

25:57.569 --> 26:00.333
Now we must reestablish
the subspace link...

26:00.405 --> 26:04.068
between these cells
and the rest of the Replicators.

26:04.142 --> 26:07.009
What if they receive instructions?

26:07.079 --> 26:09.411
It is a risk we will have to take.

26:10.816 --> 26:13.683
I will only maintain the link
for microseconds at a time.

26:13.752 --> 26:17.916
It will slow the process,
but I do not believe we have a choice.

26:30.168 --> 26:31.931
What did we get?

26:32.004 --> 26:34.996
I am processing the data now.

26:41.213 --> 26:46.241
I believe we have pinpointed the location
of the Replicators within this galaxy.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.381
They're everywhere.

27:01.700 --> 27:04.897
We are approaching Dakara.
Defenses?

27:04.970 --> 27:09.737
I am reading only a single Ha'tak-class
vessel in orbit around the planet.

27:11.109 --> 27:13.373
Ba'al must indeed be desperate.

27:13.445 --> 27:16.744
There are normally a dozen ships
patrolling this system.

27:16.815 --> 27:19.443
Then we may yet succeed.

27:30.095 --> 27:32.996
We are in position.

27:33.065 --> 27:35.260
Gliders are ready for launch.

27:36.268 --> 27:38.259
We are being hailed.

27:40.272 --> 27:42.763
<i>You have encroached
on the domain of Lord Ba'al.</i>

27:42.841 --> 27:44.866
<i>Identify yourselves immediately.</i>

27:47.980 --> 27:50.710
You are greatly outnumbered.

27:50.782 --> 27:53.046
Surrender now or be destroyed.

28:16.575 --> 28:19.043
They called you "Arrom,"
did they not?

28:20.679 --> 28:23.375
After you returned to
your plane of existence.

28:28.387 --> 28:30.548
Daniel. It is good to see you again.

28:30.622 --> 28:32.852
I don't understand.
The last thing I remember-

28:32.924 --> 28:34.858
You are still on the ship.

28:34.926 --> 28:39.386
A human-form Replicator is attempting
to probe your mind as we speak.

28:40.465 --> 28:41.989
So why are you here?

28:42.067 --> 28:45.594
Because when she is done,
she will destroy you.

28:45.670 --> 28:48.833
And when that time comes,
you will be faced with a choice.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.589
I have received word
from the battle.

29:05.657 --> 29:09.388
The bulk of the fleet continues to engage
the Replicators, as you have ordered.

29:09.461 --> 29:11.691
However...

29:12.697 --> 29:15.928
I believe it would be wise
to pull our forces back.

29:16.001 --> 29:20.734
If we stop confronting the enemy on so
wide a front, it may slow their advance...

29:20.806 --> 29:23.536
and allow us a chance
to mount a proper defense.

29:23.608 --> 29:25.303
You doubt my power.

29:25.377 --> 29:29.939
Of course not. But your fleet
is falling into their hands rapidly.

29:30.015 --> 29:33.280
- Not even the Kull warriors-
- Do not concern yourself.

29:37.489 --> 29:39.787
When the time is right...

29:39.858 --> 29:44.955
I promise you,
this nuisance will be dealt with.

29:45.030 --> 29:47.794
Trust in me.

29:50.402 --> 29:52.393
As always.

29:59.678 --> 30:03.170
<i>It took several hundred microsecond-long
connections and hours...</i>

30:03.248 --> 30:06.115
<i>to go through each
subsequent burst of data...</i>

30:06.184 --> 30:08.118
<i>but eventually,
we managed to isolate the cipher...</i>

30:08.186 --> 30:10.120
<i>that makes the Replicators
immune to the disrupter...</i>

30:10.188 --> 30:12.622
<i>and we've adjusted it accordingly.</i>

30:14.860 --> 30:16.885
The weapon works again.

30:18.864 --> 30:19.990
Good job.

30:20.065 --> 30:22.556
<i>It was an incredibly risky thing
to do, sir.</i>

30:22.634 --> 30:25.432
<i>And as it stands,
we still don't know if we were detected...</i>

30:25.504 --> 30:27.438
<i>and, of course,
the altered disrupter...</i>

30:27.506 --> 30:29.440
<i>still needs to be tested
under battle conditions.</i>

30:29.508 --> 30:31.533
<i>- Got a plan?
- Thor was able to ascertain...</i>

30:31.610 --> 30:35.410
<i>the various positions of the fleet
now controlled by the Replicators.</i>

30:35.480 --> 30:37.880
<i>We're going to engage
a few isolated ships.</i>

30:37.949 --> 30:40.383
- Be careful, Sam.
- Good luck.

30:40.452 --> 30:43.285
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

30:45.056 --> 30:47.547
Never a dull moment.

30:47.626 --> 30:51.494
So you're here to offer me
the opportunity to ascend again.

30:51.563 --> 30:53.155
If that is what you wish.

30:53.231 --> 30:55.495
What I wish? What are my options?

30:55.567 --> 31:01.096
Personally, I would choose eternal
enlightenment rather than the alternative.

31:01.173 --> 31:03.038
If it were only that simple.

31:04.176 --> 31:08.545
I admit. The decision
is not as easy as it appears.

31:08.613 --> 31:14.449
The last time for you, the experience
was challenging at the best of times.

31:14.519 --> 31:18.285
Unfortunately, I don't have any
memories of the last time I was ascended.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.086
How can I make an informed decision
if I don't remember what it was like?

31:21.159 --> 31:24.094
Daniel, I did not take
your memories from you.

31:25.397 --> 31:29.493
You think I haven't
tried to remember?

31:29.568 --> 31:31.900
- Tell me how.
- I can't.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.870
Then tell me what
I need to know.

31:33.939 --> 31:38.205
If you are seeking an absolute truth,
you will not find it.

31:38.276 --> 31:40.540
Only truth that applies to you.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.908
That is so extremely unhelpful.

31:44.983 --> 31:47.577
When the time comes,
you will know.

31:49.654 --> 31:53.021
What if Replicator Carter finds
what it is she's looking for?

31:54.426 --> 31:55.916
There is that possibility.

31:55.994 --> 31:57.928
- You have to stop her.
- I can't.

31:57.996 --> 32:00.294
Why not?
Offer me ascension now.

32:00.365 --> 32:03.926
You're not dead yet.
All I can do is prepare you...

32:04.002 --> 32:07.699
help you to find your path
to enlightenment when that time comes...

32:07.772 --> 32:10.297
if that is what you decide
you want.

32:12.944 --> 32:16.402
There's a way to defeat the Replicators
hidden within my memories, isn't there?

32:16.481 --> 32:18.881
You need only to open your mind to it.

32:26.658 --> 32:27.989
<i>Brothers...</i>

32:28.059 --> 32:31.551
all of you will be detained.

32:31.630 --> 32:34.394
Have patience...

32:37.569 --> 32:40.800
for all of you who renounce
the Goa'uld as false gods...

32:40.872 --> 32:44.171
will one day be free.

32:44.242 --> 32:48.679
Take them. Go.
You will not be harmed.

33:10.402 --> 33:14.771
The last of the garrison have surrendered.
The temple is secure.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.501
Many lives were spared today.

33:20.612 --> 33:21.840
Well done.

33:31.890 --> 33:34.017
Firing weapon.

33:43.101 --> 33:45.399
The ship's systems have shut down.

33:45.470 --> 33:50.032
- Well that worked well.
- The weapon appears to be effective.

33:52.310 --> 33:53.800
Another ship.

33:56.648 --> 33:58.741
They are firing on us.

34:00.285 --> 34:02.082
Targeting the second ship.

34:11.396 --> 34:12.363
It's still coming.

34:12.430 --> 34:15.297
They have adapted themselves
to our modifications.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.392
- That was fast.
- Yes.

34:19.070 --> 34:20.901
Initiating evasive action.

34:32.450 --> 34:35.851
Excuse the intrusion.
I will return.

34:36.755 --> 34:37.949
Stay.

35:10.655 --> 35:13.146
Speak.

35:13.224 --> 35:16.819
A force of rebelJaffa have managed
to take control of the temple at Dakara.

35:18.062 --> 35:20.360
As I had hoped.

35:20.432 --> 35:23.890
They have no doubt
gathered their full force...

35:23.968 --> 35:26.129
and presented us with
the perfect opportunity...

35:26.204 --> 35:28.229
to annihilate them once and for all.

35:28.306 --> 35:32.367
Have the fleet disengage
their battle with the Replicators...

35:32.444 --> 35:34.503
and move on Dakara.

35:34.579 --> 35:36.513
Take it back at all costs.

35:37.749 --> 35:40.115
Leave no survivors.

35:41.986 --> 35:43.647
As you wish.

35:52.430 --> 35:57.333
You control the barrier between
your consciousness and what you seek.

35:57.402 --> 36:00.428
You merely need to open your mind.

36:00.505 --> 36:02.370
The truth is...

36:02.440 --> 36:04.135
all knowledge...

36:04.209 --> 36:08.475
everything that is
and was and will be...

36:08.546 --> 36:10.036
is everywhere-

36:10.114 --> 36:13.242
out there and in all of us.

36:14.519 --> 36:16.646
If you immediately know
the candlelight is fire...

36:16.721 --> 36:19.485
then the meal was cooked
a long time ago.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.188
Yes.

36:23.261 --> 36:26.992
No. You're trying
to understand it, aren't you?

36:27.065 --> 36:29.397
It means what
you want it to mean.

36:29.467 --> 36:33.699
No, it doesn't,
and you're not Oma.

36:39.177 --> 36:40.735
No, I'm not.

36:41.813 --> 36:43.747
But it doesn't matter.

36:43.815 --> 36:47.148
Thanks to you,
I found what I was looking for.

36:53.324 --> 36:56.589
We are approaching Earth.
We will be there shortly.

36:56.661 --> 36:58.856
What's wrong?

36:58.930 --> 37:02.229
Several of my key systems
are no longer responding.

37:06.237 --> 37:09.206
We have been boarded.

37:15.613 --> 37:18.446
See if you can modify the disrupter
wave again. I'll go buy us some time.

37:18.516 --> 37:22.748
I have no way of knowing
how many Replicators you will face.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.788
Well, what choice do we have?

37:24.856 --> 37:27.154
I must return you
to Stargate Command...

37:27.225 --> 37:29.386
before my transporter
systems are affected.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.018
And what about you?

37:31.095 --> 37:34.656
I will attempt to fly this ship
as far away from Earth as possible...

37:34.732 --> 37:36.893
before it is
completely compromised.

37:36.968 --> 37:38.799
No way.
I'm not gonna let you...

37:38.870 --> 37:41.703
yourself.

37:41.773 --> 37:43.035
Damn it.

37:48.646 --> 37:51.774
The weapon worked at first,
but the Replicators adapted themselves.

37:51.849 --> 37:54.909
- They're immune again.
- No chance you guys could fix this thing?

37:54.986 --> 37:58.046
- Get it to work?
- Sir, Thor's ship was boarded.

37:58.122 --> 38:00.955
He beamed me down here
before all his systems were compromised.

38:01.025 --> 38:03.619
He's trying to get his ship
as far away from Earth as possible.

38:03.695 --> 38:05.560
I'll take that as a "No"?

38:23.648 --> 38:25.582
Never in my dreams
could I have imagined...

38:25.650 --> 38:28.312
I would one day stand
beneath these great columns.

38:28.386 --> 38:31.082
Think of it.

38:31.155 --> 38:34.249
This is the very spot in which
our enslavement began.

38:34.325 --> 38:39.661
Then this sacred temple is an appropriate
place for our enslavement to end.

38:39.731 --> 38:43.030
We have won a great victory
here today, old friend.

38:43.101 --> 38:46.002
We have won a battle, Teal'c.
Nothing more.

38:46.070 --> 38:48.004
Our victory is far from assured.

38:48.072 --> 38:52.236
Many of Ba'al's Jaffa have already
pledged their allegiance to our cause.

38:52.310 --> 38:55.768
When word spreads of what we have
accomplished, many more will follow.

38:55.847 --> 38:57.781
And their hearts
will turn cold again...

38:57.849 --> 39:00.283
if they hear our accomplishment
lasted mere hours.

39:05.723 --> 39:09.625
- What news?
- We have received word.

39:09.694 --> 39:14.461
Ba'al has broken off
his battle with the Replicators.

39:14.532 --> 39:16.022
He is coming.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.091
As we expected.

39:19.337 --> 39:23.671
You see? Taking the temple
was not our greatest challenge.

39:23.741 --> 39:26.403
Holding it will be.

39:32.717 --> 39:36.585
This Oma character-
Why do you have such reverence for her?

39:36.654 --> 39:40.920
- Those sayings are just nonsense.
- To you, maybe.

39:40.992 --> 39:45.361
If she really has as much power as you
think she does, why doesn't she help you?

39:46.631 --> 39:48.724
She merely stands by
and does nothing.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.327
You mean while you destroy
entire civilizations?

39:52.403 --> 39:55.338
That's a matter of perspective.

39:55.406 --> 39:58.842
You call it destruction.
We call it creation.

39:58.910 --> 40:01.401
You're not really trying
to justify your actions, are you?

40:01.479 --> 40:04.744
No. I have no need
for you to understand us.

40:04.816 --> 40:07.080
Why the elaborate ruse?

40:07.151 --> 40:10.609
I mean, you can probe my mind at will.
I obviously can't stop you.

40:10.688 --> 40:13.521
You could have resisted.

40:13.591 --> 40:15.786
I needed you to open up
to the possibility...

40:15.860 --> 40:19.318
of remembering the knowledge
in your subconscious.

40:19.397 --> 40:22.230
It made it much easier for me
to find what I was looking for.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.564
And what'd you find?

40:32.143 --> 40:34.134
Pretty. What is it?

40:34.212 --> 40:38.740
The ruins of an Ancient monument
on a planet now called Dakara.

40:38.816 --> 40:43.583
Within it is the one weapon
in this galaxy capable of destroying me.

40:48.559 --> 40:52.393
Thanks to you,
it will soon be no more.

41:05.810 --> 41:07.744
I'm sure he'll be here
any second now.

41:11.849 --> 41:16.081
- So-
- I am so sorry.

41:16.154 --> 41:19.180
I was just finishing up
a lovely brunch.

41:19.257 --> 41:21.350
Impudence.

41:21.425 --> 41:23.916
No. Tuna.

41:23.995 --> 41:27.522
So, I hear your fleet is
retreating from the Replicators.

41:27.598 --> 41:29.930
How could you know that?

41:30.001 --> 41:32.799
I have my sources.

41:32.870 --> 41:34.929
My fleet is on its way
to recapture Dakara...

41:35.006 --> 41:38.100
and destroy the Jaffa who have
dishonored their true god.

41:38.176 --> 41:41.270
Will you stop
with the "true god" crap?

41:41.345 --> 41:43.142
I mean, seriously,
what difference will it make?

41:43.214 --> 41:46.149
You're just delaying the inevitable.

41:46.217 --> 41:49.880
The Replicators are
a formidable enemy...

41:49.954 --> 41:54.687
but I have learned of a weapon hidden
on Dakara capable of destroying them.

41:54.759 --> 42:00.197
Really? And you're
telling me this why?

42:00.264 --> 42:04.200
Because you must destroy it
before my fleet arrives to claim it.

42:05.269 --> 42:08.534
All right.
You got me.

42:08.606 --> 42:11.370
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

42:11.442 --> 42:14.468
The weapon on Dakara
was built by the Ancients.

42:14.545 --> 42:19.141
It is not only capable of destroying the
Replicators, but all life in the galaxy.

42:19.217 --> 42:21.981
And your own
sweet self included?

42:23.054 --> 42:24.248
Yes.

42:24.322 --> 42:27.348
- So why would you use it?
- I would not.

42:27.425 --> 42:30.087
But there is one who would...

42:30.161 --> 42:33.324
one who can survive
such pervasive devastation.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.434
Please don't tell me.

42:44.308 --> 42:45.900
I asked you not to tell me.
