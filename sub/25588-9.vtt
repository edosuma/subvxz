00:28.194 --> 00:30.363
Oh, that's sweet! And well-deserved.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.575
We just realized you've always been right
and we've always been wrong.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.701
As an apology,

00:34.784 --> 00:37.454
here are a couple of anti-gravity boards
we made for you.

You don't have an appointment.
Mr. Krupp, escort them out.

Yeah, they're exactly like our friends,

05:30.079 --> 05:32.206
So that's why it's called Herome Jorwitz.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.418
[narrator] <i>Actually, it's because we got
too lazy to draw an entire new school</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:38.212

would never say.

anything trivial that shrinks the brain.

Oh, splinter. But that's good.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.040
It's a teachable moment.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.292

08:21.375 --> 08:23.669
the Grow-it-alter 3000,

08:26.839 --> 08:28.549

08:29.383 --> 08:31.427
Oof! And then we can study finger anatomy.

Uh, whatchamacallit? Oh, yeah, finger?

- And bizarro Melvin isn't smart?
- [Werica] I know you're new,

08:44.899 --> 08:46.442
but we do things differently here.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.071
We work hard, we cherish knowledge,
and we respect the teachers.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.532
If you can do that,
this school will give you back ten times

08:52.615 --> 08:53.658
what you put into it.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.827
Okay, it's a little boring,
but everything works.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.912
The teachers teach,

08:57.995 --> 09:00.831
the food is actually made from food,
and Krupp's not yelling at us.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.960
- Maybe we should give it a shot.
<i>- ♪ Giving it all they got ♪</i>

09:04.043 --> 09:06.087
I can't see a thing in these glasses!

09:06.170 --> 09:10.174
Probably a good thing, because this place
looks like a mortuary for childhood.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.885
- Can't do it!
- Too boring! True, this school is great,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.679
but it's missing one thing. Fun.

09:14.762 --> 09:18.057
Yeah. I thought I could live without it,
but I can't. So, what do we do?

09:18.266 --> 09:19.308
I'll tell you what we do.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.396
We make candy rain from the sky.
We put rubber dart guns in every hand.

09:23.854 --> 09:28.276
We tear down this school and replace it
with the biggest bouncy house ever made!

09:29.610 --> 09:33.072
Okay, maybe not that last one.
But let's put the fun in functional.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.700
Yeah, let's teach these kids
how to live a little.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.827
Ah! How do people see in those things?

09:38.244 --> 09:41.706
"You can't succeed every time,
but you can try all the time."

09:41.789 --> 09:43.666
Now those are words to live by.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.334
Sure, but now let's have some fun.

09:48.462 --> 09:49.462
Move the letters around.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.225
[Harold] "Try every time
and you can succeed."

09:54.510 --> 09:58.097
Really? I mean, with those letters
you can make "butt," "turd," "snot."

09:58.180 --> 10:00.224
Yeah, but this is good advice.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.894
[sighs] Gonna be an uphill battle.
Time to get real.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.021
You mean make a comic?

10:05.104 --> 10:07.982
I was gonna say transfer
to another school.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.108
But sure. Comic.

<i>"I'm doing everything right,"</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
<i>except they weren't
'cause they had no fun.</i>

10:21.537 --> 10:22.848
<i>They were all, "More math, please"</i>

10:22.872 --> 10:25.499
<i>and "Yes, I'll vacuum the driveway,
thank you!"</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:27.084
[imitates whirring] <i>Fun, not.</i>

10:27.168 --> 10:29.754
<i>This one kid had a birthday party
and hired an accountant</i>

10:29.837 --> 10:32.006
<i>to write numbers on a whiteboard.</i>

10:32.089 --> 10:35.426
<i>But nobody smiled or giggled
or said the word "pickle" at all!</i>

10:35.509 --> 10:36.969
<i>I mean, come on. Pickle!</i>

10:37.053 --> 10:38.530
<i>Then these aliens came down and said,</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:42.141
<i>"What is the sound of human laughter,
or we will mess up your planet!"</i>

10:42.224 --> 10:43.452
<i>The kids didn't know what to do.</i>

10:43.476 --> 10:47.855
<i>They tried cleaning the silverware drawer
and ironing a skirt, but it was no fun.</i>

10:47.938 --> 10:51.359
<i>The aliens were gonna blast the planet
to bits with their blast ray.</i>

10:51.442 --> 10:54.195

10:54.278 --> 10:56.197
<i>But then Captain Underpants
came swooping in</i>

10:56.280 --> 10:58.115
<i>like Captain Underpants swooping in.</i>

10:58.199 --> 11:00.910
<i>"I'll save Earth and junk
with entertainment!"</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:05.623
<i>Then he flew into a haystack and popped up
with hay in his ears and said, "pickle!"</i>

11:05.706 --> 11:07.625
<i>The aliens were like, "What?"
But in alien...</i>

11:07.708 --> 11:10.002
[speaking gibberish]

11:10.086 --> 11:12.671
<i>Then Captain Underpants did all
his best basketball tricks.</i>

11:12.755 --> 11:14.590
<i>The Fibbidy Flop, the Aqua Duck,</i>

11:14.673 --> 11:17.176
<i>and big finish,
the Diggidy, Diggidy, Diggidy, Doop!</i>

11:17.259 --> 11:19.136
<i>That's like with nine balls.</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:20.888
<i>The aliens didn't get it, but the kids!</i>

11:20.971 --> 11:22.571
<i>They had never seen anything so amazing.</i>

11:22.640 --> 11:24.683
<i>They started smiling
and their faces cracked</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:27.186
<i>and their dumb old frowns
fell right off their faces!</i>

11:27.269 --> 11:29.021
<i>Clank, clank,
clankety-clank, clank, crack!</i>

11:29.105 --> 11:32.274
<i>But the unhappy aliens knocked
Captain Underpants far away and said,</i>

11:32.358 --> 11:35.903
<i>"We will blast your planet and junk!
What do you say about that?"</i>

11:35.986 --> 11:38.155
<i>And then the birthday party kid said,
"Pickle!"</i>

11:38.239 --> 11:41.784
<i>And all the kids laughed really,
really hard, like for the first time!</i>

11:41.867 --> 11:44.620
<i>But the sound... </i> [laughing]

11:44.703 --> 11:47.581
<i>Giggle, ha! But the sound
was super painful to the aliens</i>

11:47.665 --> 11:48.850
<i>and they covered their one ear.</i>

11:48.874 --> 11:51.377
<i>"Ow, that human laughing!
Stop your noising!"</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:54.022
<i>And the kids all said, "Pickle, pickle,
pickle, pickle!" And laughed, like, a lot.</i>

11:54.046 --> 11:54.922
[laughing]

11:55.005 --> 11:58.384
<i>And the aliens said, "Enough!
We cannot survive your secret weapon!"</i>

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
<i>And they flew away. Yay!</i>

11:59.844 --> 12:03.097
<i>Then Captain Underpants flew back in.
"Tra-la... Where'd they go?" The end.</i>

12:05.724 --> 12:07.810
You look like a guy
who likes reading, huh?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.271
Almost as much
as I like paying attention in class.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.438
Then try this!

12:12.898 --> 12:16.694
It's like you gave me something
I didn't know I wanted my whole life.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.821
This is a game changer!

12:18.904 --> 12:20.906
Time to have some fun.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.093
[narrator] <i>And in less time

Laughter? In this school? Strange.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.211
Say there, you children,
what's all this giggle-gaggle about?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.132
Oh, no. Not here. Not now!

12:38.841 --> 12:41.302
[groans, screams]

12:41.427 --> 12:43.387
[Harold] Are you gonna yell at us
or scream at us?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.389
- Because I vote yell.
- Your yell is pretty good.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.517
[laughs]

12:48.601 --> 12:53.022
I told you, I'm a new man,
thanks to this perfect school.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.316
No more yelling, no more detention.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.278
I'm finally able to be the principal
I was meant to be.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.072
Now grab some bean bag and let's rap.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.575
I need a favor. [grunts]

13:04.658 --> 13:07.703
I need you not to ruin this school... Whoa!

13:08.078 --> 13:10.348
Because it's the only thing
that has ever brought joy to my life,

13:10.372 --> 13:13.417
aside from the hand-me-down wooden toys
Uncle Grover gave me,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.377
which were actually riddled
with rusty nails

13:15.461 --> 13:17.379
which ultimately gave me tetanus.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.965
But still, no comics, no pranks.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.884
- No fun?
- Correct. [grunts]

13:21.967 --> 13:22.967
What's in it for us?

13:23.010 --> 13:25.304
I won't send you to prison. [chuckles]

13:25.387 --> 13:29.475
I mean, a good education. Right?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.061
You got yourself a deal.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.397
- We're doing a prank, right?
- Yep, and it's gonna be huge.

Whoo-hoo! Pickle!

13:45.866 --> 13:48.452
Yeah. Water balloon, Choog,
but nice attitude.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.497
Thanks to George and Harold,
we could lose this school.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.250
That's why I need the brightest mind here
to help me save it.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.043
I'm just surprised it's a gym teacher.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.419
General Moon Shu once said,

13:57.503 --> 14:00.339
"If you know your enemy,
you've already won the battle."

14:00.422 --> 14:02.675
Sure, Moon Shu lost every battle,

14:02.758 --> 14:04.927
but the point is,
George and Harold are the enemy.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.346
- So we're gonna lose?
- No! Because we have me!

14:07.429 --> 14:10.057
The most brilliant man
ever to organize a dodgeball game.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.517
Not sure that's saying much.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.102
I'll make the school perfect again.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.562
- For all of us.
- Works for me.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.856
Ooh! By the way, did you see
the latest <i>Road Trash </i> video?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.483
Why, what happened? No, don't tell me!

<i>Yeah!</i>

14:30.119 --> 14:31.954
I told you not to tell me!

14:32.037 --> 14:34.290
How's that little balloon epic?

14:34.373 --> 14:39.086
It's not. Until we make it giant
with this baby! The Grow-it-alter 3000.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.505
Does Mr. Neamer know
you stole his invention,

14:41.589 --> 14:44.049
which is theft
and makes us all complicit in a crime?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.968
Borrowed, and no.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.845
That's why it's a prank!

14:47.928 --> 14:50.764
Now, Werica, just read what's on the card
into the mic.

I mean, free laptops? So good.

[Captain] I've seen bigger.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.726
And as the Roman historian
Portus Trovius once said,

18:22.810 --> 18:26.855
"Big is good. Bigger is better.
But the biggest? Forget about it."

- And I don't wear shoes!
- What does that mean?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.863
It means your brain
is no match for his brawn!

18:34.947 --> 18:35.948
No, it doesn't.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.326
Careful, I'm armed.
With my arms, not weapons.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.870
Unless you count my arms as weapons,
which they are.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.165
Not compared to my brain,

A, dodge the telephone pole</i>

19:14.736 --> 19:17.865
<i>or B, take it in the face? "B" again.</i>

19:17.948 --> 19:18.782
<i>Final question.</i>

19:18.866 --> 19:22.202
<i>Will Captain Underpants,
A, dodge the flying yacht</i>

19:22.286 --> 19:24.872
<i>or B, go on a bruise cruise?</i>

19:24.955 --> 19:26.955
- [boat horn blares]
<i>- You're right. Dumb question.</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:28.625
Ahoy, matey!

19:28.709 --> 19:31.170
Welcome aboard the S.S... [slurring]

19:31.837 --> 19:34.256
- Dude went nautical!
- Where'd he even get a yacht in Piqua?

19:34.339 --> 19:37.801
Do you believe your brawn
is superior to my brains now?

19:37.885 --> 19:40.429
I will levitate you two into outer space!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.639
Or at least several blocks away,

19:42.723 --> 19:45.058
restoring this school
to its former perfection!

19:45.142 --> 19:48.020
But you can't do that! Without a permit!

19:48.604 --> 19:50.397
[Neamer] My power is growing!

19:51.940 --> 19:55.235
Look! I can shoot
colored lights out of my eyes!

19:56.612 --> 19:58.363
- [both scream]
- Let's get outta here.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.908
[both] Whoa!

20:00.991 --> 20:01.991
You two are next.

20:02.659 --> 20:06.455
How do we downsize his brain
before he squeezes all the fun outta ours?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.874
Sorry, guys. Watching <i>Road Trash.</i>

20:08.957 --> 20:12.794
He just found a plastic bag.
A plastic bag!

20:12.878 --> 20:16.381
[man] <i>I just found a plastic bag!
Uh-huh! Yeah!</i>

20:16.465 --> 20:19.259
I avoid anything trivial
that shrinks the brain

20:19.343 --> 20:23.055
like those silly videos on the internet
where a guy finds trash on roads.

20:23.138 --> 20:26.350
I got it. We're gonna dumb him down
with <i>Road Trash.</i>

20:26.433 --> 20:27.517
Hey. My phone.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.937
- But how's he gonna see it?
- Look! The Grow-it-alter!

20:30.771 --> 20:32.189
- Look out, Harold!
- [gasps]

20:35.525 --> 20:36.360
Hey! Brainy!

20:36.485 --> 20:40.030
Ha, ha! You two are making this
awfully easy!

20:40.364 --> 20:41.698
Get ready to...

20:42.616 --> 20:44.493
Is that <i>Road Trash?</i>

20:44.576 --> 20:47.204
Road Trash,<i> yeah!</i>

20:47.287 --> 20:49.539
<i>Another trash bag? What're the odds?</i>

20:49.623 --> 20:51.250
<i>- Uh-huh. Yeah!</i> [screams]
- [horn honks]

20:51.416 --> 20:53.293
<i>That one almost got me! Whoo!</i>

20:53.377 --> 20:54.753
It's beautiful.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.356
Who would've thought Neamer's
Grow-it-alter would come in handy?

20:57.381 --> 20:59.466
[narrator] <i>Everyone. Literally, everyone.</i>

20:59.549 --> 21:01.510
Whoa! Still got my sea legs.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.970
[yelling]

21:03.053 --> 21:04.680
[man] <i>No way! I just found a...</i>

21:04.763 --> 21:07.099
Wait, is this the one
where the guy finds the garbage?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.475
I love that one.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.686
Oh, no. Can't stop watching.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.939
Trash fun to watch. Me lose think good.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.233
[groaning]

21:16.316 --> 21:18.860
It's working!
<i>Road Trash</i> is shrinking his brain!

21:22.281 --> 21:23.281
Whoa.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.576
What are these? Hey! I can see!

21:26.785 --> 21:28.078
<i>Jurisprudence.</i>

21:28.161 --> 21:30.789
And read! This book is interesting!

21:30.872 --> 21:34.167
- Whoa. [chuckles] Whoa!
<i>- Oh, a cassette tape! Wow!</i>

21:35.210 --> 21:37.671
Sorry, still getting my land legs.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.590
Hey, is that the remote?
I wanna hear what the garbage is saying!

21:41.466 --> 21:43.593
- [both] No!
- Whoa!

21:46.221 --> 21:49.224
Whoa. That bird should lay off the carbs.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.976
[grunting]

21:51.059 --> 21:52.059
What! Huh?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.896
My perfect school is a pigeon!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.524
And where are my clothes?

21:57.607 --> 22:00.277
[narrator] <i>Chapter 8, Home is Where
The Heartburn is.</i>

22:00.360 --> 22:02.237
[Krupp] That school was so nice.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.657
The teachers knew how to read,
the kids didn't make fun of me,

22:05.741 --> 22:07.784
and... [sighs] Those omelets.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.996
But I gotta admit,
I was bored out of my skull!

22:11.079 --> 22:12.414
- So were we.
- Me, too.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.310
It'll be nice to pull pranks in a place
where they're appreciated again.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.628
And to yell at kids again.
Starting with you two!

22:18.712 --> 22:21.048
Let the good times ro... Oh! Oh! Oh!

22:21.465 --> 22:24.051
Hey, George, how come there weren't
bizarro versions of us?

22:24.134 --> 22:26.762
- 'Cause we're one of a kind, buddy.
- Two of a kind.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.305
- [both chuckling]
- Yeah!

22:32.976 --> 22:37.022
Look! I just found a perfectly good guy!
Who would throw this away?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.273
- [horn honks]
- Whoa!

22:38.356 --> 22:41.276
That one almost got both of us. Whoo!

22:41.359 --> 22:42.694
[theme music playing]
