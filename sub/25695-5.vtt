00:21.522 --> 00:23.732
Do not talk about
what you're about to see.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.734
Understand?

00:27.528 --> 00:28.362
Yes.

01:00.102 --> 01:00.936
May I?

01:04.438 --> 01:05.899
Just do what you need to do.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.493
Was this the first time?

01:19.621 --> 01:20.455
No.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.751
I've been having them for years.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.089
Though they are becoming more frequent.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.383
How have you been sleeping?

01:31.800 --> 01:32.634
Fine.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.054
Though I have been having headaches.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.309
I see.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.231
Drink tea with fennel and juniper.

01:46.565 --> 01:47.774
It will help the headaches.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.069
And what about the fits?

01:52.738 --> 01:54.948
Hopefully they will lessen over time.

01:55.115 --> 01:55.949
Hopefully?

01:57.701 --> 02:00.370
I'm afraid there's not much I can do.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.957
This illness...

02:06.043 --> 02:07.336
is of the gods.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.933
And this just started now?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.645
He's been having them for years.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.813
- You knew?
- No.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.233
Will this kill him?

02:32.819 --> 02:33.654
I don't know...

02:34.112 --> 02:35.030
no one does.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.117
I suppose it doesn't matter.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.286
Either way...

02:42.037 --> 02:42.913
he's finished.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.416
How's that?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.337
The Senate will tear him apart.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.798
How will they know?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.594
You're not going to tell them.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.555
Why wouldn't I?

03:01.973 --> 03:04.976
Because right now he's vulnerable.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.732
You should be looking for ways
to take advantage.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.504
<i>Julius Caesar
has appointed himself dictator of Rome,</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:59.591
<i>giving him authority to pass any law
he sees fit.</i>

05:06.181 --> 05:09.142
<i>But in the midst of achieving
this unprecedented power,</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:14.314
<i>he faces a mysterious illness
that has no apparent cure.</i>

05:16.817 --> 05:19.236
The ancient sources
described him as having

05:19.319 --> 05:23.532
a kind of falling sickness,
what we might describe as epilepsy.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.745
All of which, I suspect,
showed the kind of ongoing stresses

05:28.829 --> 05:31.164
involved in the job that he was doing.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.505
<i>Despite his health problems,</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:43.343
<i>Caesar focuses on making a stronger,
more unified Rome.</i>

05:47.347 --> 05:49.099
<i>Since returning from Egypt,</i>

05:49.933 --> 05:52.227
<i>he's fed a starving population</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:55.438
<i>and restored order to the Senate.</i>

06:00.068 --> 06:02.612
<i>Now, with the city under control,</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:08.243
<i>Caesar wants to fix a Republic
that he believes is broken.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:24.676
<i>For decades,</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:30.307
<i>Caesar has watched an inefficient Senate
grow increasingly powerful.</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:34.853
<i>But he knows the future of Rome's success</i>

06:35.854 --> 06:37.397
<i>lies with the people.</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:44.529
A consistent problem in the Roman state
had been the issue of the Roman economy.

06:45.614 --> 06:50.952
You had a number of poor Romans who filled
the city of Rome looking for work,

06:51.786 --> 06:53.038
and being unable to find jobs.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.415
So Caesar sought to reform this.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.212
<i>To get the Roman citizens
back to work,</i>

07:02.339 --> 07:04.883
<i>Caesar begins a massive
construction program.</i>

07:09.471 --> 07:10.680
<i>Building temples,</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:12.140
<i>libraries,</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:14.309
<i>and a new harbor,</i>

07:15.393 --> 07:17.562
<i>providing jobs for thousands of Romans.</i>

07:21.650 --> 07:23.902
Caesar was a paradox
as a politician.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.820
On the one hand,
his priority was always Caesar.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.864
He wanted to advance himself.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.950
But on the other hand,

07:31.493 --> 07:35.413
instead of always supporting the side
of wealth and power,

07:36.706 --> 07:40.627
he would try to extend more benefits
to ordinary people.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.470
<i>While his construction projects
help the people,</i>

07:51.930 --> 07:54.933
<i>his most innovative
and long-lasting reform</i>

07:55.809 --> 07:58.186
<i>is the introduction of a new calendar.</i>

08:00.939 --> 08:02.357
When Caesar returns to Rome,

08:02.440 --> 08:05.735
he finds that the calendar is off
by at least 40 days.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.365
The Roman government
had become so corrupt,

08:10.448 --> 08:13.743
so inept,
that they had literally lost track

08:13.827 --> 08:15.912
of the days, the months, the seasons.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.710
<i>Caesar bases the new calendar
on a solar year,</i>

08:22.711 --> 08:26.297
<i>putting the entire Republic
on a universal timetable,</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:29.134
<i>one that is still used today.</i>

08:34.304 --> 08:37.100
<i>While Caesar's reforms are popular
with the people,</i>

08:38.393 --> 08:39.811
<i>he's acting on his own.</i>

08:40.895 --> 08:42.938
<i>Without the support of the Senate.</i>

08:45.817 --> 08:46.985
Over the past hundred years,

08:48.945 --> 08:52.157
Rome has experienced a time
of unprecedented growth.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.368
We've expanded our borders
north into Gaul,

08:55.785 --> 08:58.580
east into Macedonia,
and west into Hispania.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.750
Growth is good.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.710
It fuels the economy.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.754
It makes us stronger,

09:06.588 --> 09:07.714
more powerful.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.971
But in order to preserve that power,
we must consolidate it.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.474
Beginning...

09:18.725 --> 09:20.518
by granting full citizenship

09:21.269 --> 09:23.813
to those living in the conquered provinces
of Gaul.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.692
If we neglect them

09:28.651 --> 09:31.154
and continue to treat them
as prisoners of war,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.323
there will be another rebellion.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.451
If we acknowledge the Gauls
as Roman citizens,

09:36.534 --> 09:39.913
they will behave as Roman citizens.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.999
This is the cost

09:43.583 --> 09:45.293
of maintaining the peace.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.922
There will be no debate.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.050
This legislation

09:53.384 --> 09:54.969
takes effect immediately.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.398
Caesar wants to acquire
all the power that he can,

10:08.817 --> 10:10.568
but he's also trying to create

10:10.652 --> 10:14.405
a bigger, more impressive system
of Roman government

10:14.656 --> 10:20.578
that is fit for purpose when it comes
to ruling what is now a global empire

10:20.662 --> 10:23.248
stretching across the whole
Mediterranean world.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.921
And now Caesar can push through his own
legislative agenda,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.422
do whatever he wants,

10:31.506 --> 10:34.592
without having to worry
about getting the Senate's support.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.185
He's stripped us of all authority.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.771
We have no power whatsoever.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.565
It's only temporary.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.859
I wouldn't be so sure.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.655
As soon as he's accomplished
his political goals, he will step down.

10:55.905 --> 11:00.118
Once you have power,
it's very hard to let it go.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.001
<i>While Brutus disagrees
with Caesar's methods,</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:10.461
<i>he works closely with him,</i>

11:11.462 --> 11:13.590
<i>helping Caesar write legislation.</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:19.888
<i>And Caesar begins considering Brutus
as a possible heir.</i>

11:21.306 --> 11:23.057
Caesar was concerned with his legacy,

11:23.600 --> 11:26.436
because he did not have a male son
of his own.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.273
He was just taking thought
for the future success of his name.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.066
We need a census.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.612
- A proper census of the city.
- We've had surveys done in the past.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.071
But they weren't done properly.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.618
Brutus had long been considered by Caesar
something of a surrogate son.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.539
He wanted Brutus to recognize
that there was something

11:46.623 --> 11:49.042
maybe greater that they could do together.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.421
<i>For Brutus,
everything is about to change,</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:56.341
<i>with the arrival of a foreign ally</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:59.302
<i>with news that will shock the Republic.</i>

12:13.024 --> 12:16.402
Cleopatra, within a year
of after Caesar leaves Egypt,

12:16.653 --> 12:17.820
follows him to Rome.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.909
Most Romans knew Caesar's reputation
as a bit of a playboy.

12:23.159 --> 12:28.248
Most Romans also understood
that commanders and leaders abroad

12:28.456 --> 12:29.958
tended to have flings.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.090
What was unusual

12:37.173 --> 12:39.425
was that person going to Rome,

12:41.261 --> 12:45.265
particularly if they had the reputation
of somebody like Cleopatra.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.703
This was not only a foreigner

13:06.786 --> 13:09.330
but a queen in her own right.

13:26.431 --> 13:30.685
She was so far outside the mold
of how Romans saw their women,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.146
it must have been
a bit of a shock to them.

13:40.778 --> 13:41.612
So...

13:42.655 --> 13:43.823
how was your journey?

13:44.991 --> 13:45.825
Long.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.161
But I hope worthwhile.

14:00.798 --> 14:01.841
What is this?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.474
His name is Cesarion.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.185
Your son.

14:19.108 --> 14:24.072
One of the most shocking features
of Caesar's return for Rome

14:24.155 --> 14:26.699
was the arrival in Rome of Cleopatra...

14:27.825 --> 14:28.785
with a son.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.289
For the <i>de facto</i> head of the Roman state

14:33.373 --> 14:36.042
to have a romantic relationship
and then a child

14:36.125 --> 14:40.004
with the queen of an autonomous
Mediterranean power,

14:40.505 --> 14:44.050
that sent shockwaves reverberating
around the world.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.639
She has him wrapped around her finger.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.059
- He barely said a word.
- He didn't have to. It was obvious.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.979
- We don't know if it's even his child.
- You think that makes any difference?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.273
Now he has a son.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.984
- To the Queen of Egypt.
- It doesn't change anything.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.071
- It changes everything.
- For Rome or for you?

15:07.031 --> 15:07.865
Excuse me?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.078
- I just meant...
- This isn't about me.

15:13.162 --> 15:13.996
Or Rome.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.624
This is about you.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.794
Whether or not you realize it,

15:20.711 --> 15:22.130
you've just been replaced.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.594
As long as Cleopatra's in power
and their son is alive,

15:29.220 --> 15:30.346
you don't matter.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.391
Let's not overreact.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.645
Whatever position of power you think
you've secured for yourself,

15:38.020 --> 15:39.063
it's temporary.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.691
So what do you want me to do?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.655
Make friends with the Senate,
you'll need them.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.742
Is that all?

15:53.202 --> 15:54.078
For now.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.498
And keep your eyes open.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.753
People in your position of power
don't last very long.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.760
It's hard to imagine that Servilia
didn't see Cleopatra as a rival,

16:09.927 --> 16:12.430
especially when Cleopatra came to Rome.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.892
Servilia's chief loyalty was to her son,
Brutus.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.643
After all, he was her son

16:17.768 --> 16:20.313
and he did represent the future
of her house

16:20.438 --> 16:22.106
in a way that Caesar never could.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.752
He has your eyes.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.426
One day, he'll be the King of Egypt.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.762
And maybe Rome.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.599
Rome won't accept a king.

16:57.934 --> 16:58.893
It did once.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.396
That was a long time ago.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.652
Then it could again.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.368
I think that Cleopatra plants
the seed of monarchy

17:16.827 --> 17:18.788
and all it can be in Caesar's head.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.084
Does Caesar come away from Cleopatra
thinking, "I want to be a king"?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.920
Perhaps not quite in such bald terms,

17:26.337 --> 17:30.341
but I think he comes away convinced
that there's really no future for Rome

17:30.424 --> 17:34.178
without him being the man who runs it
in one form or another.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.958
<i>By 45 B.C.,</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:09.088
<i>Julius Caesar has conquered
over 200,000 miles of territory,</i>

18:10.089 --> 18:12.133
<i>pulled Rome out of chaos,</i>

18:13.843 --> 18:17.972
<i>and named himself dictator
for the next ten years.</i>

18:19.181 --> 18:20.850
<i>But with the arrival of a son,</i>

18:21.642 --> 18:24.145
<i>Caesar begins thinking about a dynasty.</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:29.066
The conclusion
that Caesar reached

18:29.150 --> 18:31.319
is that Roman politics should be dominated

18:31.402 --> 18:33.362
by just one family,

18:33.946 --> 18:35.406
by his family.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.953
He's feeling his way toward some kind
of monarchy.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.749
<i>To secure his legacy,</i>

18:45.333 --> 18:49.045
<i>Caesar begins a citywide project
celebrating his image</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:53.382
<i>which he puts on display
alongside Roman gods.</i>

18:54.842 --> 18:57.094
<i>Ivory towers are built in his honor,</i>

18:57.720 --> 19:01.766
<i>including the Basilica Julia,
which still exists today.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.852
Caesar was an arrogant man.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.896
He had broken all the rules,

19:06.979 --> 19:10.983
so he felt that he was entitled
to make all the rules.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.237
It's hard to avoid the conclusion
that power had gone to his head.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.325
<i>His birthday is declared
a public holiday,</i>

19:19.909 --> 19:22.286
<i>and he begins wearing a purple robe,</i>

19:22.870 --> 19:25.623
<i>a garment once reserved for Roman kings.</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:30.961
I think everyone saw some form
of autocracy,

19:31.504 --> 19:35.007
but how severe it would be
was anyone's guess.

19:36.050 --> 19:39.011
Whether Caesar viewed himself as a king
or something else,

19:39.095 --> 19:41.681
I think he really did want to be a god.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.060
<i>Caesar believes leading Rome
is his destiny,</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:49.397
<i>so he looks to solidify his power.</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:51.232
<i>Permanently.</i>

20:40.322 --> 20:43.617
Julius Caesar has faithfully served
the Republic of Rome.

20:44.618 --> 20:48.706
Through his dedication and sacrifice,
he has ushered in an unprecedented era

20:48.789 --> 20:50.750
of peace and prosperity.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.003
He's conquered foreign enemies,

20:55.087 --> 20:56.422
expanded our borders

20:57.214 --> 21:00.801
and eased the burden
of our less fortunate citizens.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.015
His astounding achievements deserve honors
of equal merit.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.813
It is with that in mind,
that I hereby name Julius Caesar

21:15.232 --> 21:16.984
Dictator in perpetuity.

21:19.069 --> 21:19.987
On me!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.368
Cover it up!

21:31.415 --> 21:33.501
Julia... has passed.

21:52.895 --> 21:53.729
Stay back.

22:35.729 --> 22:39.233
The man has himself proclaimed
as dictator for life

22:39.608 --> 22:41.861
and then collapses in a convulsive fit.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.947
I don't know where to begin.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.867
He's going to step down.
Isn't that what you told us?

22:48.492 --> 22:49.869
I can't see that happening.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.663
- Did you know he was sick?
- Of course not.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.542
I think you did.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.211
Perhaps that's how you finagled
your position?

22:59.295 --> 23:00.421
I earned my place.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.923
What else aren't you telling us?

23:06.552 --> 23:09.346
Are you questioning my loyalty
to the Republic?

23:12.016 --> 23:14.393
Don't ever question my loyalty.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.188
Then we can count on you
to do whatever's necessary

23:19.356 --> 23:21.984
if and when the time comes?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.111
War is coming.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.780
It's time you picked a side.

23:39.209 --> 23:42.379
Emotionally,
Brutus was conflicted.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.799
On the one hand, Caesar was a great man.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.637
Brutus had known him since he was a boy.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.766
On the other hand,
Caesar was the dictator for life,

23:53.974 --> 23:56.769
the man who posed a threat
to the Roman Republic

23:57.019 --> 23:59.647
and everything that Brutus held dear.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.068
<i>Despite their personal history,</i>

24:04.401 --> 24:07.321
<i>Brutus is forced by his colleagues
to make a choice,</i>

24:09.990 --> 24:12.910
<i>while Caesar looks to distract the Senate
from his illness</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:15.996
<i>with plans of a shocking new conquest.</i>

24:33.055 --> 24:36.058
<i>Knowing his sickness
could make him seem weak to the Senate,</i>

24:36.850 --> 24:39.603
<i>Caesar decides to temporarily leave Rome.</i>

24:42.523 --> 24:45.776
I think Caesar was frustrated
by being in Rome,

24:46.110 --> 24:48.404
dealing with the minutia
of Roman politics,

24:48.821 --> 24:53.742
jousting with Senators,
having to negotiate with people

24:53.826 --> 24:56.078
he no longer considered his equals.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.290
On the battlefield,
everything was simpler and cleaner.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.336
<i>So Caesar declares he'll invade Parthia,</i>

25:05.546 --> 25:08.090
<i>the same empire that defeated Crassus.</i>

25:10.134 --> 25:12.803
Caesar decided to invade Parthia

25:13.178 --> 25:15.264
to keep the Roman people on side.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.394
It may have been a ploy
to distract the people,

25:21.270 --> 25:24.732
but it also shows that he's something
of a conquest junkie.

25:25.065 --> 25:29.069
He's addicted to the thrill
that comes from conquest

25:29.153 --> 25:31.822
and the power and money
that it generates for him.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.410
<i>A victory in Parthia
would bring Caesar not only riches,</i>

25:37.745 --> 25:41.040
<i>it would make him even more popular
with the Roman people.</i>

25:42.291 --> 25:44.084
Caesar's career followed a course

25:44.501 --> 25:48.714
where when he's out on campaign
conquering new territory for Rome,

25:48.797 --> 25:52.009
defeating Rome's enemies,
he's very popular, everything is great.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.137
Once he has to actually come back
and govern,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.598
things get stickier, things get harder.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.017
If we come up through the north,

26:00.225 --> 26:01.727
we can cross the mountains.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.481
The only other option is the desert route,
but we don't want to do that.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.942
- Well, Crassus went through the desert.
- Crassus died in the desert.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.655
All the armies in the world can't save you
from dying of thirst.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.492
Do not underestimate the risk.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.660
He was arrogant.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.039
He listened to the wrong people.
That's what killed him.

26:24.917 --> 26:25.959
You called for me.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.253
Ah, you're here. It's all right.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.549
I want you to call a meeting
with the Senate.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.511
I'm announcing a new campaign.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.223
We're going to conquer Parthia.

26:42.893 --> 26:43.727
Parthia?

26:45.062 --> 26:46.814
That's a bold choice.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.527
I'll arrange a meeting immediately.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.030
Tomorrow will be fine.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.663
Now, where were we?

27:08.836 --> 27:13.340
<i>For Brutus, an invasion
of Parthia shows that Caesar values power</i>

27:13.966 --> 27:15.926
<i>over the welfare of the Republic.</i>

27:17.344 --> 27:21.265
I think Brutus saw
as much as anyone

27:21.348 --> 27:24.852
that Caesar was a threat
to the long-established

27:24.935 --> 27:28.105
constitutional order
of the Roman Republic.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.149
Brutus was a philosopher,

27:30.774 --> 27:34.778
and he saw that Caesar threatened
Roman ideals.

27:35.654 --> 27:41.034
Brutus also felt that as the descendant
of the founder of the Roman Republic,

27:41.118 --> 27:43.579
he had a particular responsibility

27:43.662 --> 27:48.584
to defend the Republic against someone
who was opposing it.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.727
- Thank you for meeting with me.
- Your message was cryptic.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.645
Let him speak.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.067
Caesar is calling an emergency meeting
of the Senate.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.071
He's going to announce his plans
to invade Parthia.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.991
He thinks another conquest will serve
as a distraction.

28:21.074 --> 28:21.909
He's not serious.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.952
Are you really that surprised?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.621
We don't have the funds to finance...

28:25.704 --> 28:27.998
There are far bigger implications
than finances.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.334
The last thing we need is another war.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.335
Then talk to him.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.754
It's too late for that.
He's already made up his mind.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.506
- There's no talking him out of it.
- Then perhaps we should let him go.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.675
When he's gone, we can take back control
of the Senate.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.428
We can't risk him returning more powerful
than he already is.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.513
Well, that's assuming he's successful.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.391
If he fails,
he'll bring the Republic down with him.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.310
How are we supposed to stop him?

28:49.853 --> 28:52.022
I thought you were prepared to do
whatever's necessary?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.241
Inside Rome,

29:02.324 --> 29:05.410
there's a real fear
that's beginning to set in

29:05.494 --> 29:08.997
that what Caesar's gonna do
is make himself king of Rome.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.585
The idea that there would be
a king of Rome

29:13.961 --> 29:17.589
was anathema
to Roman political psychology.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.678
Inside the Senate,

29:23.553 --> 29:27.766
this is really the moment when they say,
"We have to get rid of Caesar."

29:45.659 --> 29:49.162
<i>Three days before Caesar
is scheduled to leave for Parthia,</i>

29:50.789 --> 29:53.000
<i>an emergency Senate meeting is called.</i>

29:55.460 --> 29:58.297
Caesar's planned war
with Parthia

29:58.380 --> 30:00.966
frightened his political opponents,

30:01.049 --> 30:03.218
because they knew that once he left Rome,

30:03.510 --> 30:05.721
and took his position as a general,

30:05.887 --> 30:08.223
he would be defended by a bodyguard.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.893
In Rome, Caesar had no formal bodyguard.

30:12.269 --> 30:17.232
So he would be virtually untouchable
once he was a general in the field.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.449
<i>To guarantee there are no intruders,</i>

30:27.951 --> 30:31.413
<i>the Senate hire guards to stand watch
outside the theater.</i>

30:50.057 --> 30:55.187
I think most of the reason why
Brutus decided to conspire against Caesar

30:55.395 --> 30:56.563
was political.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.109
He could never tolerate a situation

31:01.360 --> 31:05.322
where the Republic had been defeated
by an individual man

31:05.822 --> 31:09.451
who had taken powers to himself
in perpetuity.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.427
May I have a word regarding my brother?
He's in exile.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.262
- After the session
- Please!

32:17.477 --> 32:18.311
Let me through.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.732
- Please. I'm not above begging.
- You can bring it up with the magistrates.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.109
I haven't seen him in a decade.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.528
Then a few more hours won't matter.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.446
Please!

32:27.529 --> 32:28.989
Get off me.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.824
Get him off me!

33:57.202 --> 34:00.163
- <i>And what's your name?
- Brutus.</i>

34:21.810 --> 34:25.230
<i>On the 14th of March, 44 B.C.,</i>

34:26.606 --> 34:30.025
<i>Julius Caesar is stabbed 23 times</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:32.696
<i>by a faction of senators,</i>

34:33.280 --> 34:35.072
<i>led by Brutus.</i>

34:43.998 --> 34:45.625
Caesar knew that he had enemies.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.545
Caesar knew that some of those enemies
would kill him

34:48.628 --> 34:50.255
if they had the opportunity to.

34:50.338 --> 34:55.135
I don't think that Caesar thought
that they had the balls to do it.

35:16.698 --> 35:20.076
<i>The assassination
of Julius Caesar shocks Rome.</i>

35:26.583 --> 35:29.002
<i>Slaves carry his body through the streets</i>

35:30.086 --> 35:31.838
<i>as the city mourns.</i>

35:37.636 --> 35:40.680
<i>Brutus and his conspirators
try to restore order,</i>

35:41.640 --> 35:44.267
<i>but things quickly spiral out of control.</i>

35:45.393 --> 35:48.647
The death of Caesar created
a huge political vacuum

35:48.730 --> 35:50.357
at the top of the processes

35:50.690 --> 35:54.778
and men immediately started to fight
for how to achieve

35:54.861 --> 35:57.113
clarity in the system going forward.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.791
<i>In the months that follow,</i>

36:07.874 --> 36:11.086
<i>Brutus and Mark Antony become
bitter rivals</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:14.381
<i>fighting for power on the battlefield.</i>

36:17.592 --> 36:18.968
<i>Brutus is defeated</i>

36:19.761 --> 36:21.262
<i>and as he's being captured,</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:22.972
<i>takes his own life.</i>

36:30.021 --> 36:33.108
<i>Mark Antony's allies will soon conspire
against him,</i>

36:34.192 --> 36:37.946
<i>and he flees to Egypt,
where he marries Cleopatra.</i>

36:42.242 --> 36:44.953
<i>After war breaks out
between Egypt and Rome,</i>

36:45.954 --> 36:49.290
<i>Antony and Cleopatra die
in a double suicide.</i>

36:55.088 --> 36:59.384
<i>Caesar's child, Caesarion,
rules Egypt for two weeks,</i>

37:00.009 --> 37:02.262
<i>before he's killed at age seventeen.</i>

37:16.192 --> 37:17.610
<i>By assassinating Caesar,</i>

37:18.069 --> 37:21.114
<i>the Roman senators believed
they were saving the Republic.</i>

37:22.657 --> 37:24.159
<i>But the opposite occurs.</i>

37:27.412 --> 37:29.581
<i>And after years of violence and upheaval</i>

37:30.373 --> 37:34.836
<i>the only way to restore peace
is through the leadership of one man.</i>

37:35.837 --> 37:39.632
<i>His name is Octavian,
the nephew of Julius Caesar.</i>

37:41.009 --> 37:44.262
<i>And on the 16th of January 27 B.C.,</i>

37:44.763 --> 37:46.890
<i>he becomes Rome's first emperor,</i>

37:48.057 --> 37:50.310
<i>ruling for the next 40 years.</i>

37:51.728 --> 37:54.981
Caesar, in the end,
destroyed the Republic.

37:55.899 --> 38:00.904
The example that he set,
the wheels that he set in motion.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.949
After Caesar,
nothing could be the way that it was.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.663
<i>Just 20 years
after Caesar's death,</i>

38:11.956 --> 38:13.583
<i>Rome is an empire...</i>

38:16.920 --> 38:20.381
<i>with over 50 million people
living within its borders,</i>

38:21.341 --> 38:24.385
<i>roughly twenty percent
of the world's population.</i>

38:26.346 --> 38:29.349
<i>No man helped shape
that transformation more...</i>

38:29.933 --> 38:31.476
<i>than Julius Caesar.</i>

38:36.064 --> 38:41.778
Caesar has been one
of the most influential figures

38:42.070 --> 38:44.322
in the history of Western civilization.

38:45.198 --> 38:49.285
His assassination directly tied
to the end of the Republic

38:49.702 --> 38:52.956
and the start
of this imperial autocratic rule.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.334
So he's been hugely influential
in that sense.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.592
Caesar certainly stands
as one of the great men of history today.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.012
He did take steps to curb corruption,

39:08.137 --> 39:09.430
to eliminate debt,

39:09.681 --> 39:11.766
to make life a bit better
for the poorer citizens

39:11.850 --> 39:12.934
and they loved him for it.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.605
So, part of his legacy is bound up
with that reputation.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.825
<i>Caesar's legacy goes beyond
the borders of Rome.</i>

39:30.910 --> 39:31.828
<i>Foreign leaders,</i>

39:32.453 --> 39:35.123
<i>including Russian Tsars and German Kaisers</i>

39:35.498 --> 39:37.375
<i>use translations of his name,</i>

39:39.669 --> 39:42.630
<i>and the month of July
is named in his honor.</i>

39:45.758 --> 39:48.344
Caesar's legacy is enormous.

39:49.095 --> 39:54.017
He's one of the two or three most famous
human beings that has ever lived.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.730
Every subsequent leader
for the last 2,000 years,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.858
anybody who's politically ambitious,
militarily ambitious,

40:02.358 --> 40:05.361
knows about Julius Caesar,
and whether consciously or not,

40:05.445 --> 40:07.780
is comparing themselves to Julius Caesar.

40:07.864 --> 40:12.035
He looms enormous
in the political and military history

40:12.368 --> 40:14.662
of the Western world and the whole world.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.415
And of course he stands
at one of the most famous

40:17.540 --> 40:19.459
political transitions in human history,

40:19.542 --> 40:22.420
which is when the Roman Republic
becomes the Roman Empire.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.381
And who's at the very center of that?
It's Julius Caesar.
