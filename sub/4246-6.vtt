Who the hell is David Rosen
and why do we have a problem?

00:02.525 --> 00:03.609
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:03.610 --> 00:04.742
If David Rosen finds

00:04.743 --> 00:06.577
the connection between Cytron
and Doyle Energy,

00:06.595 --> 00:08.245
every one of us here is

00:08.263 --> 00:10.131
spending the rest of
their lives in prison.

00:10.165 --> 00:11.799
I did a little digging, and
it turns out that Cytron...

00:11.850 --> 00:13.885
They weren't just an
Internet security company.

00:13.919 --> 00:15.436
They also developed software.

00:15.470 --> 00:16.938
Officially, it was used
as slot machines.

00:16.972 --> 00:19.089
- And unofficially?
- Voting machines.

No.

(Crow cawing)

00:39.444 --> 00:40.795
Am I too late?

00:40.846 --> 00:42.496
You made it just under the wire.
Here.

00:42.531 --> 00:43.464
Thank you.

00:44.198 --> 00:45.315
No problem.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.654
Okay, the man opened China.

01:25.672 --> 01:27.039
And that negates Watergate.

01:27.091 --> 01:29.542
No. Nothing negates Watergate.
Watergate was a catastrophe.

01:29.593 --> 01:31.878
And yet you believe Nixon
was a great president.

01:31.929 --> 01:34.213
I believe he was good at his job.

01:34.264 --> 01:37.300
You make me sad. I'm gonna
start weeping any minute.

01:37.334 --> 01:38.768
I don't think one act
defines a person,

01:38.802 --> 01:40.836
and I certainly don't think
it defines a presidency.

01:40.854 --> 01:42.305
When it's a republican...

01:42.339 --> 01:43.890
(Elevator bell dings) Okay, fine.
You want a democrat?

01:43.941 --> 01:45.775
- Don't say William Jefferson Clinton.
- William Jefferson Clinton.

01:45.809 --> 01:48.227
And here we go again with
the "one blue dress" speech.

01:48.278 --> 01:50.146
William Jefferson Clinton
was brilliant, scholarly,

01:50.180 --> 01:51.447
and an immaculate politician.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.316
That can't be undone
by one blue dress.

01:53.350 --> 01:54.534
Nixon bugged the campaign offices

01:54.568 --> 01:55.868
of Democratic candidates.

01:55.903 --> 01:58.054
That's not a blue dress.
The man was a criminal.

01:58.088 --> 02:00.406
Who opened China.

02:00.457 --> 02:02.575
(Laughs)

02:02.626 --> 02:05.328
(Laughs)

02:05.362 --> 02:07.046
Thank you for a lovely evening.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.381
- Is it over?
- Edison.

02:08.414 --> 02:10.082
I have several points
I'd like to make about Nixon

02:10.133 --> 02:12.552
- inside your apartment.
- I am not sleeping with you.

02:12.586 --> 02:14.754
I also have some intriguing
thoughts about Reagan.

02:14.805 --> 02:16.973
It's our second date.

02:17.007 --> 02:18.558
We lived together.

02:18.592 --> 02:21.394
I've built you a bookcase. I've
watched you press your hair.

02:21.428 --> 02:24.680
This is not our second date.
It's our 4,000th date.

02:24.714 --> 02:27.016
Good night, Edison.

03:04.771 --> 03:07.223
So it's about a pipeline...

03:07.257 --> 03:09.725
All of this... the voting
machines, the explosion.

03:09.759 --> 03:11.727
Looks like it.

03:11.761 --> 03:12.829
Huh.

03:12.863 --> 03:13.896
What?

03:16.116 --> 03:18.100
I'm just thinking.

03:18.118 --> 03:19.935
Do you want a drawer?

03:19.953 --> 03:21.770
- What?
- I have this drawer,

03:21.788 --> 03:23.372
and it's not really
doing much,

03:23.407 --> 03:24.707
just kinda sitting there
in my dresser

03:24.741 --> 03:26.442
with these socks
I bought for hiking.

03:26.460 --> 03:27.827
But then I never go hiking,

03:27.878 --> 03:30.613
and I just thought that
maybe you would want it.

03:32.132 --> 03:34.800
I mean, this is good, right?

03:34.835 --> 03:36.586
I feel like this is good.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.672
It's good.

03:39.723 --> 03:43.092
So do you want my drawer?

<i>I would love your drawer.</i>

You wrote an article
about Hollis Doyle.

04:48.006 --> 04:49.924
Front page, above the fold.

04:49.958 --> 04:52.276
James, you wrote an article
about Hollis Doyle?

04:52.327 --> 04:53.844
Front page, above the fold.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.364
You wrote an article
about Hollis Doyle?!

04:56.398 --> 04:57.398
Front page, above the fold!

04:57.416 --> 04:58.999
Honey, you should be proud of me.

04:59.017 --> 05:00.151
We were lying in bed.

05:00.185 --> 05:01.586
You had that cold.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.137
I was eating thai noodles.

05:03.171 --> 05:05.489
A commercial for Doyle Energy
came on, and I said something.

05:05.524 --> 05:07.975
- Cyrus. Baby. Hmm. What did I say?
- No, let me refresh your memory

05:08.010 --> 05:10.111
by reading it to you
from this here article

05:10.145 --> 05:12.413
I found on the front page of
the "Times," above the fold,

05:12.447 --> 05:14.682
and I quote, "Hollis Doyle is

05:14.716 --> 05:16.617
"a deep-fried, backwoods,
inbred hillbilly,

05:16.652 --> 05:18.135
"and we'd never let him
inside the white house

05:18.170 --> 05:21.171
if he didn't come with a
blank check", in quote.

05:21.205 --> 05:23.640
I didn't quote you. I quoted
a senior white house official.

05:23.641 --> 05:26.543
Any <i>idiot</i> in this town

05:26.577 --> 05:28.678
knows that I'm your senior
white house official!

05:28.729 --> 05:30.914
In my enthusiasm over
returning to my job,

05:30.965 --> 05:33.066
I stepped over the line.
I apologize. That was wrong.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.085
You apologize. That was wrong.
<i>But?</i>

05:35.119 --> 05:36.469
According to my editor,
it's the best expose

05:36.504 --> 05:38.171
anybody's ever written
about this administration.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.356
They think it's gold.

05:39.390 --> 05:41.491
They want more investigative
pieces about Hollis,

05:41.542 --> 05:42.626
and they want me
to write them.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.110
Nobody else. Me.

05:44.145 --> 05:46.129
Do you know how rare
this air is that I'm breathing?

05:46.163 --> 05:48.265
I'm Woodward.
I'm Bernstein.

05:48.299 --> 05:51.351
I'm back, honey.
I am so back!

05:51.785 --> 05:55.604
James, you <i>cannot</i> write
articles about Hollis Doyle.

05:56.907 --> 05:58.374
Watch me.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.848
You have to trust her.

06:06.482 --> 06:08.333
I trust her. I do. I just...
I want to run her prints

06:08.367 --> 06:09.768
and do a background check.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.820
Maybe a D.N.A. analysis,
add a little surveillance and...

06:11.854 --> 06:14.606
Huck, she's a nice,
normal girl.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.575
Normal feels weird.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.643
Ahem. I need more room
for my law books.

06:18.661 --> 06:20.829
- What law books? - The ones I'd have
in my office if I had more space.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.430
One of us needs
Stephen's office.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.633
- No one is getting that office.
- It can't just sit there empty.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.968
- Like some monument to Stephen
forever. - If you'd rather not

06:27.003 --> 06:28.486
choose between them,
I could always...

06:28.504 --> 06:29.721
- Yeah.
- Nice try.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.323
Why is someone sending
you sheet music?

06:31.357 --> 06:33.375
- And a check for $100,000.
- Who's it from?

06:33.426 --> 06:36.728
Doesn't say. "Don Giovanni"?
We producing operas now?

06:37.162 --> 06:38.646
It's not just Mozart.

06:41.767 --> 06:44.202
Classic spycraft goes all
the way back to the abwehr.

06:44.236 --> 06:45.486
They're Nazi intelligence.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.988
Whoever did this is old-school.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.606
Is that morse code?

06:48.941 --> 06:50.675
It's not that simple,
but it's the same principle.

06:50.709 --> 06:51.926
No matter how high-tech things get,

06:51.960 --> 06:53.761
analog's always
the best way to go.

06:53.795 --> 06:54.897
(Harrison) What's it say?

06:54.898 --> 06:56.347
Well, this right here...
That's "protect them."

06:56.348 --> 06:57.965
- Protect who?
- Well, these are names.

06:58.016 --> 07:00.051
(Olivia) - Names of who?
- Spies, I think.

07:00.085 --> 07:01.435
- Spies?
- How can you tell they're spies?

07:01.470 --> 07:04.188
Because this name here...
That's me.

07:11.701 --> 07:14.003
Postmark on the envelope
reads Ann arbor,

07:14.037 --> 07:14.887
- stamped two days ago.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.120
There's an A.P. story about
a public suicide that day.

07:17.121 --> 07:18.205
A man shot himself in the head,

07:18.239 --> 07:19.222
right out on the street,
broad daylight.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.823
A Robert Brooks.

07:20.875 --> 07:21.774
Ring a bell, Huck?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.826
There's a photo.
(Key clicks)

07:23.861 --> 07:25.495
- That's Crosby.
- Who's Crosby or who <i>was...</i>

07:25.529 --> 07:27.397
He was my case officer in B-613.

07:27.431 --> 07:29.499
- What's B-613?
- Quinn.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.818
This is bad.
This is very bad.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.536
(Harrison) Well, why shoot
himself in public? What is that?

07:33.571 --> 07:35.838
Some kind of way of the samurai,
honor-killing business?

07:35.873 --> 07:38.541
He did it in public so we'd
know, know it wasn't a hit.

07:38.576 --> 07:42.345
Otherwise...
This is very, very bad.

07:43.914 --> 07:45.064
I knew he was a spy, but...

07:45.115 --> 07:46.416
Wait, like a James Bond,

07:46.450 --> 07:47.917
"spy who came in from
the cold" spy-spy?

07:47.952 --> 07:49.669
(Abby) Not like fiction, like reality.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.487
- Huck was a trained killer spy.
- I don't think "was" enters into it.

07:51.521 --> 07:53.289
Once a killer spy, always
a killer spy, right?

07:53.323 --> 07:55.642
So all these other names...
Are they also killer spies?

07:59.045 --> 08:00.679
Huck?

08:00.713 --> 08:01.930
Huck, what are you doing?

08:01.964 --> 08:03.798
I have to go now.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.200
Go?
Go where?

08:05.434 --> 08:07.469
It's safer for you
if you don't know.

08:07.503 --> 08:09.588
- So good-bye.
- Huck, stop.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.440
We are in
my wheelhouse now.

08:11.474 --> 08:14.875
Okay, B-613 was a top-secret,
off-the books program

08:14.893 --> 08:16.444
funded by the C.I.A.

08:16.478 --> 08:17.929
I'm supposed to be a ghost.

08:17.963 --> 08:21.049
If my name... and not my real
name, but Huck, my name,

08:21.083 --> 08:24.151
the alias that goes with this
life at Pope and Associates...

08:24.169 --> 08:26.904
If my name is on the list,
it's time to disappear.

08:26.956 --> 08:29.641
Those are the rules,
so I can't stop.

08:29.692 --> 08:32.493
Crosby sent the list to me.
The check is in my name, too,

08:32.527 --> 08:33.910
so whatever this is,
whatever I'm supposed to

08:33.962 --> 08:36.481
protect you against, it's in
<i>my</i> wheelhouse, not yours,

08:36.532 --> 08:37.849
and that means
we can fix this.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.082
Liv...

08:39.134 --> 08:40.818
Huck, trust me.

08:40.903 --> 08:42.370
Let me take care of this.

08:42.404 --> 08:44.772
Let me take care of you.

08:44.806 --> 08:47.342
Okay?

08:47.376 --> 08:50.111
I can give you 24 hours.

08:50.179 --> 08:51.512
Okay.

08:52.846 --> 08:54.981
Ears to the ground, people.
Let's work our sources.

08:55.016 --> 08:58.101
National security, media, C.I.A.
See if anything's brewing.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.403
See what might have
the spooks spooked.

09:02.806 --> 09:05.308
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:05.342 --> 09:08.144
No one enjoys
a print-licking,

09:08.179 --> 09:11.497
but a tarring rolled out by
what I hear is your boyfriend?

09:11.515 --> 09:12.982
We're married, actually.

09:13.017 --> 09:14.551
Your wife then.

09:14.585 --> 09:15.701
Husband.

09:15.719 --> 09:17.403
Oh. Sorry.
I assumed you were

09:17.438 --> 09:19.439
the, you know,
fella in that deal.

09:19.473 --> 09:21.658
Husband as well.
Two husbands.

09:21.692 --> 09:22.992
Wasn't trying to imply nothing
about what you all get up to.

09:23.043 --> 09:25.945
- None of my... never mind.
- Make your point, Hollis.

09:25.979 --> 09:27.413
Whatever you call him...
Husband.

09:27.447 --> 09:28.865
- I call him my husband.
- You'd best get a handle on the boy

09:28.899 --> 09:30.283
and shut that noise down.

09:31.117 --> 09:33.885
James, my husband,
is a professional journalist,

09:33.919 --> 09:35.237
an excellent one at that.

09:35.271 --> 09:37.089
I can no more dictate
what he reports

09:37.123 --> 09:39.524
than he can tell me what
to advise the president.

09:39.559 --> 09:40.626
Write about how I stroll
around the White House

09:40.660 --> 09:42.293
like I own the damn place?

09:42.312 --> 09:45.163
How's that not true? How are
you right now in my office?

09:45.198 --> 09:46.498
You don't have
an appointment.

09:46.516 --> 09:49.117
How is that <i>not</i> strutting
around like you please?

09:49.168 --> 09:51.219
I take the point.

09:52.838 --> 09:54.906
Now you take mine.

09:54.941 --> 09:56.325
My problems
are your problems,

09:56.359 --> 09:59.311
and if things blow up,
in the end, they'll be his.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.797
You and your husband call
each other whatever you please,

10:01.831 --> 10:04.466
but put your wife on a leash.

10:04.517 --> 10:06.451

10:08.321 --> 10:09.354
(Door closes)

10:09.588 --> 10:11.356
Nigel Sarnoff...

10:11.974 --> 10:14.325
International master hacker.
No one's ever seen his face.

10:14.359 --> 10:16.060
No one knows his real identity.

10:16.094 --> 10:18.646
Responsible for seven major
classified document dumps

10:18.697 --> 10:20.248
as making his cyber
scene debut in 2002.

10:20.299 --> 10:22.099
He exposed thousands
of diplomatic communiques

10:22.134 --> 10:24.118
- going back three decades.
- Did the same thing

10:24.153 --> 10:25.486
to the defense department
two years ago...

10:25.521 --> 10:27.705
Which led to endless hearings,
dishonorable discharges.

10:27.739 --> 10:29.957
Popped champagne at the Pentagon
when he was reported dead.

10:30.008 --> 10:31.608
According to the web,
that was staged.

10:31.643 --> 10:33.110
Sarnoff's been underground
for two years,

10:33.144 --> 10:35.028
and based on all the hacker
chatter, now he's back,

10:35.063 --> 10:37.448
set to release something big,
something imminent.

10:37.482 --> 10:40.250
Sounds like it's the intel community's
turn in the spotlight.

10:40.285 --> 10:44.304
Huck, I need to know if info
on B-613 goes public,

10:44.355 --> 10:45.656
how bad is it?

10:45.690 --> 10:47.291
Let's just say we did things,

10:47.325 --> 10:48.825
things that would
make it hard for you

10:48.860 --> 10:51.428
to sing the national anthem
and mean it.

10:51.462 --> 10:54.231
In the name of national
security, we were the bad guys.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.237
How do we find him... Sarnoff?

11:01.255 --> 11:03.339
He's careful
and he's got an army

11:03.357 --> 11:04.741
of hackers covering his tracks.

11:04.775 --> 11:07.060
Lawyers, too, I bet.
Find out who represents him.

11:07.094 --> 11:08.812
Sarnoff's a big-fish client.
There are only six attorneys

11:08.846 --> 11:10.246
in town he could be
working with.

11:10.281 --> 11:12.248
Find out which one.
Get me a meeting.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.002
Counselor, nice place.

11:16.053 --> 11:17.237
Neutral turf.

11:17.871 --> 11:19.505
Where's Nigel Sarnoff?

11:19.556 --> 11:22.858
He's right here.

11:22.892 --> 11:24.577
<i>(Distorted voice)</i>

In this case,
you're blowing the cover

11:33.102 --> 11:35.621

(Beep)

12:06.451 --> 12:08.903
Who at the agency knew
about B-613?

12:08.937 --> 12:11.289
No one. Crosby ran it
as a separate unit.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.274
We were walled off.

12:12.308 --> 12:14.208
How many names are
on that list besides yours?

12:14.209 --> 12:15.192
Five.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.061
We need to bring them in.

12:17.895 --> 12:19.863
These people...
They all do what I do.

12:19.897 --> 12:22.399
They're professionals.
You understand?

12:22.433 --> 12:23.483
I understand.

12:23.517 --> 12:25.252
You don't want them here.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.538
Sarnoff's bluffing.
He doesn't have the goods yet.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.290
If he did, he would've
released them already,

12:30.324 --> 12:32.492
so if no one else knew
about the program,

12:32.527 --> 12:33.827
one of the names on that list

12:33.861 --> 12:35.278
is someone who's
going to give him

12:35.329 --> 12:37.230
documentation of B-613
in the very near future,

12:37.248 --> 12:39.566
so however it works,
however you call them in,

12:39.584 --> 12:41.251
I need you to do it now.

12:41.285 --> 12:43.503
Because one of those

They give you a frequency,

- That sounds fake.
- It's not fake.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.879

13:38.217 --> 13:39.801
you can't trace

13:39.819 --> 13:41.152
The radio is how we
talk to each other,

13:41.203 --> 13:43.971
how all the spies talk to each
other all around the world.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.074
You listen every day, and every
day, there's no message.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.508

13:47.526 --> 13:49.044

you listen,

- Hollis wasn't happy.

16:39.775 --> 16:41.342
Hollis has been unhappy since...

16:55.423 --> 16:56.690

17:09.369 --> 17:10.854

17:11.189 --> 17:13.289
Apparently, he told her a joke,
and she laughed.

17:13.339 --> 17:15.141

She never laughs.

19:24.901 --> 19:26.602
When I worked with him in the '90s,

19:26.636 --> 19:29.638

19:29.673 --> 19:31.306
<i>(Harrison) Now he's a Professor.</i>
<i>Upstate New York,</i>

19:31.324 --> 19:33.509
<i>divorced... probably from</i>
<i>sleeping with his students.</i>

19:33.543 --> 19:35.527
(Clicking continues)
And the guy with

19:35.578 --> 19:36.628
the prescription pad
in his pocket?

19:36.680 --> 19:37.846
That's Melvin Feen.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.982
<i>He was able to go days</i>
<i>without sleep,</i>

19:40.016 --> 19:41.216
<i>and that wasn't</i>
<i>even his real talent.</i>

19:41.233 --> 19:42.333
<i>(Quinn)</i>
<i>- What was his real talent?</i>

19:42.334 --> 19:44.068
<i>Knowing how much pain</i>
<i>a person could tolerate</i>

19:44.103 --> 19:46.070
<i>- before it killed them.</i>
<i>(Abby) - Sounds like a charmer.</i>

19:46.105 --> 19:47.071

<i>(Abby) Let me guess...</i>
<i>She lit things on fire.</i>

19:54.863 --> 19:56.397
<i>Didn't matter</i>
<i>what the target was.</i>

19:56.415 --> 19:57.465

20:42.727 --> 20:46.045
So we go right back to where we
were ten years ago? On the run?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.614
I have kids.
My oldest is 6,

20:47.648 --> 20:48.615
my youngest is
barely out of diapers.

20:48.649 --> 20:50.200
They're little.
I'm married.

20:50.251 --> 20:51.551
I have arthritis.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.436
I just got tenure,
and I like my life now.

20:53.487 --> 20:55.872
I like who I am.
I like this name, my house,

20:55.906 --> 20:57.723
my friends, my students.

20:58.641 --> 21:00.192
I have arthritis.
I'm not running.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.895
Which is why we all need to work
together to stop this thing.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.496
Me... by working
my high-level contacts,

21:04.531 --> 21:07.449
you... by resisting
whatever urge you may have

21:07.484 --> 21:09.301
to resolve this problem
criminally.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.519
Why?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.320
Because it's not
who you are anymore.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.588
B-613 is over.

21:13.723 --> 21:15.140
You've made progress
in your lives.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.442
You've earned back
a piece of your souls.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.228
And even if you were able
to find Sarnoff and kill him,

21:20.263 --> 21:22.380
he's got an army of hackers
to take his place.

21:22.398 --> 21:24.566
You'd always be hunting
the next target.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.984
Maybe you'd be able
to keep your name,

21:26.018 --> 21:29.004
but otherwise, it'd be
just like being on the run.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.788
Is that understood?

21:35.845 --> 21:37.062
Good.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.434
You'll hear from me when
there's something to report.

21:42.468 --> 21:47.272
Until then,
no one leaves this room.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.657
Who are you calling?

21:48.691 --> 21:50.659
My babysitter.

21:50.693 --> 21:53.111
Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.

21:54.330 --> 21:55.947
<i>Hola,</i> Mariana.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.533
<i>¿Cómo están las niñas?</i>

22:01.587 --> 22:02.587
What?

22:02.622 --> 22:04.205
Nothing.

22:04.257 --> 22:07.542
I'm just thinking about all
that progress we've made.

22:20.805 --> 22:21.938
(Whistles) This is a nice office.
Beautiful office.

22:21.989 --> 22:23.406
Mm. Who wouldn't want
to keep this office?

22:23.441 --> 22:24.641
Since you love it so much...

22:24.675 --> 22:26.093
Look, one of these
people's the leak,

22:26.127 --> 22:27.461
and we have to figure out who.

22:27.495 --> 22:28.762
Huck will be our eyes and
ears inside the room.

22:28.796 --> 22:30.130
Abby and I will be
on background.

22:30.164 --> 22:31.731
Aren't these people
all masters of deception?

22:31.766 --> 22:32.932
But their new lives
might provide clues

22:32.950 --> 22:34.084
as who might be
the source of the leak.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.519
Maybe someone's
in financial trouble,

22:35.553 --> 22:37.237
spending money they don't have,
buying things that might suggest

22:37.271 --> 22:39.556
they're about to skip town.
We'll start with public records.

22:39.590 --> 22:41.007
Good. Quinn, you monitor
outgoing calls.

22:41.025 --> 22:43.460
Huck's set up a surveillance
feed in his office.

(Rufus featuring chaka Khan's

about what we did?

22:51.785 --> 22:53.102
Me? It's funny.

22:53.136 --> 22:54.820
I went back to med school
thinking that, you know,

22:54.854 --> 22:56.255
maybe I would save a few lives

22:56.289 --> 22:57.823
and would make up
for the ones I took.

22:57.857 --> 23:00.309
And then I realized the real
reason I wanted to be a doctor...

23:00.360 --> 23:01.610
To cut people up.

23:01.661 --> 23:03.279
Is that my fault
or the government,

23:03.313 --> 23:05.147
who turned me into a monster?

23:05.181 --> 23:06.582
I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

23:06.616 --> 23:07.967

skip out on the bill

it's Charlie,

Charlie's a believer.

26:58.990 --> 27:00.707

- How about we put the guns down?

27:00.991 --> 27:02.308
(Betsy) - Stay out of this, pretty boy.
- I'm out of it.

27:02.342 --> 27:03.309

solve anything?

- Yes. We all die. There's no leak.
- I'm okay with that.

as long as Charlie goes first.

a very close second.

27:12.318 --> 27:13.385

at what you do.

27:13.419 --> 27:14.736
Sort this out
using interrogation.

27:14.754 --> 27:16.087
And this plan "B" that
you got up and running

27:16.122 --> 27:17.639
is guaranteed
mutual destruction.

27:17.673 --> 27:19.290
But lucky for you,
there's another plan in place,

27:19.325 --> 27:21.292
and her name is Olivia Pope,
and she'll be here any minute.

27:21.327 --> 27:23.545
And here you all thought
you had a problem.

27:23.579 --> 27:24.846
(Chuckles) You don't.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.715
It's being handled by the best.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.652
So let's put 'em down, hmm?

27:34.656 --> 27:35.840
On three.
One...

27:39.762 --> 27:41.730
Huck, be a leader.
Two...

27:47.953 --> 27:50.138
Now everyone.

27:50.172 --> 27:51.606
Three.

27:54.694 --> 27:56.611
Great.

27:57.945 --> 28:00.530
Now, uh, just hand me
your weapons and... okay.

28:01.081 --> 28:03.933
Cool.
You hang on to those

28:03.984 --> 28:06.803
and, uh, just hang tight.

28:06.837 --> 28:08.538
She'll be here any minute.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.409
Oh, my God.
Harrison, that was...

28:13.444 --> 28:14.494
Big office talk is
what that was.

28:14.528 --> 28:15.728
I'll admit,
it was very brave...

28:15.746 --> 28:17.213
Big office, baby.

28:17.264 --> 28:19.766
Liv's coming back soon, right?

28:19.800 --> 28:20.967
I don't know.

28:20.985 --> 28:22.001
She has a plan, though, right?

28:22.036 --> 28:23.820
- I think so.
- You <i>think</i> so?

28:23.854 --> 28:24.938
She's a vague person,
very vague.

28:24.972 --> 28:26.005
Well, whatever it is,
it better work,

28:26.040 --> 28:27.974
'cause this suit is
way too nice

28:28.008 --> 28:30.593
to be marred by holes
and blood.

28:30.628 --> 28:32.045
(Exhales)

28:37.017 --> 28:39.219
(Exhales deeply)

28:39.353 --> 28:41.587
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

28:44.441 --> 28:46.159
Honey.

28:46.193 --> 28:47.677
Come in.

28:47.711 --> 28:48.828
Come in.

28:49.746 --> 28:51.547
I've...
never been in here before.

28:51.581 --> 28:53.565
It's very oval

28:53.600 --> 28:56.118
and smaller than you'd think, right?

28:56.169 --> 28:58.971
(Chuckles)
Will... will you sit?

28:59.005 --> 29:01.440
If you're trying to intimidate
me with the oval office...

29:01.474 --> 29:03.942
I know you've always
wanted to come in here.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.943
That's all.

29:05.361 --> 29:06.328
You're buttering me up.

29:06.379 --> 29:07.595
I'm buttering you up.

29:07.647 --> 29:08.913
Yeah. Why?

29:08.948 --> 29:10.982
I wanted to thank you
for writing that article.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.584
I'm serious.
You did me a big favor.

29:13.618 --> 29:14.852
Because now I have an excuse

29:14.887 --> 29:17.588
to ban that racist, sexist,
homophobic son of a bitch

29:17.623 --> 29:19.173
from the White House
on the basis of optics

29:19.207 --> 29:20.958
and not just
personal distaste.

29:20.992 --> 29:22.343
But?

29:22.394 --> 29:23.427
I'm going to lose my job.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.829
The president is
going to fire me

29:24.863 --> 29:26.514
if the articles on
Hollis Doyle continue...

29:26.548 --> 29:28.316
Not tomorrow, but soon.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.601
Because I'm making him look bad,

29:30.636 --> 29:33.654
and I can't be trusted not
to leak quotes to my husband.

29:33.689 --> 29:37.742
- Cyrus, I did not know...
- I don't... want to ask you

29:37.776 --> 29:39.543
to stop writing
about Hollis Doyle.

29:39.578 --> 29:43.247
I wouldn't do that.
I love you and I am...

29:43.282 --> 29:44.498
proud of you.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.988
(Voice breaking)
But I need you to know

29:51.022 --> 29:55.710
how you writing about
Hollis Doyle affects me.

30:00.497 --> 30:01.631
I will not write about him
anymore.

30:01.665 --> 30:03.883
I won't. Okay?
I won't.

30:03.918 --> 30:05.418
I don't mean to cry.

30:05.469 --> 30:07.637
No, it's okay. I understand.
I'm sorry. I won't.

30:07.655 --> 30:09.339
(Exhales)

30:09.373 --> 30:11.307
Oh. Okay. I have a briefing.
Yeah, of course you do.

30:11.342 --> 30:12.558
I have...
Yeah.

30:12.593 --> 30:13.660
- I'll... I'll see you...
- At home.

30:13.711 --> 30:14.928
Uh, yes. I love you.

30:14.962 --> 30:17.530
I love you, too.

30:17.564 --> 30:18.715
(Door opens)

30:18.749 --> 30:20.916
(Door closes)

30:22.269 --> 30:24.453
(Normal voice)
The things I have to do.

30:26.857 --> 30:29.025
(Grunts)

30:40.554 --> 30:41.571
(Mouse clicks)

30:42.606 --> 30:44.023
(Keys clicking)

30:47.626 --> 30:50.361
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

30:50.395 --> 30:52.864
If you release this,
your lawyer is dead.

30:52.915 --> 30:54.215
- What?
- If this comes out,

30:54.249 --> 30:55.983
there'll be a half a dozen
highly trained assassins

30:56.018 --> 30:58.569
who'll want revenge,
and Barry here is perhaps

30:58.604 --> 31:00.705
the only person in the world
who knows where you are.

31:00.789 --> 31:02.007
I don't know where he is.

31:02.040 --> 31:02.740
<i>(Distorted voice)</i>
<i>Let me explain</i>

31:02.841 --> 31:03.875
<i>something to you, Ms. Pope.</i>

31:03.926 --> 31:05.976
<i>Your job is to spin</i>
<i>and gloss over...</i>

31:06.011 --> 31:06.994
Stop!

31:07.028 --> 31:09.280
I am trying to save your life!

31:09.331 --> 31:10.965
I do not know
where Sarnoff is.

31:10.999 --> 31:14.134
Barry, they will find you,
they will torture you,

31:14.169 --> 31:15.785
they'll get what they need from you,

31:15.820 --> 31:17.070
and then they will kill you.

31:17.104 --> 31:19.423
All I know is I released the
money two hours ago.

31:19.424 --> 31:20.056
- To who?

31:20.057 --> 31:21.608
- A bank account.
- Whose account?!

31:21.642 --> 31:25.178
I don't know. All I know is
the bank account number.

31:25.212 --> 31:26.229
Write it down.

31:26.263 --> 31:28.114
I...
(Rustling)

31:30.351 --> 31:32.518
(Olivia)
I got a bank routing number.

31:32.536 --> 31:36.122
C-H-0-0-2-3-0-1-1-5...

31:36.157 --> 31:41.845
1-1-9-8-2-2-3-5-0.

31:43.047 --> 31:45.032
(Lowered voice)
Those first two letters?

31:45.966 --> 31:46.966
That means it's Swiss.

31:46.984 --> 31:48.000
Which means?

31:48.035 --> 31:49.619
I can't hack a Swiss bank account,

31:49.670 --> 31:52.188
especially not in the two hours
we have left.

31:52.239 --> 31:53.606
We can do a lot in two hours, Huck.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.925
No, we can't.
Game over.

31:55.976 --> 31:57.610
Go home, Liv.

31:57.644 --> 31:59.144
I am not...

31:59.162 --> 32:00.496
You can't just leave.

32:00.530 --> 32:02.798
You can't just disappear forever
without saying good-bye.

32:02.883 --> 32:05.818
(Voice breaking) I can't just
never see you again.

32:05.852 --> 32:07.536
- Huck.
- I won't

32:07.587 --> 32:09.455
leave without saying good-bye...
I won't.

32:09.489 --> 32:11.324
But go home.

32:11.358 --> 32:14.043
Please. Don't come back
to the office.

32:14.077 --> 32:15.544
Go home.

32:15.579 --> 32:17.913
We're in my wheelhouse now.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.500
(Beep)

32:22.935 --> 32:25.620
(Huck) This is
the Swiss bank account

32:25.654 --> 32:27.438
that Sarnoff paid money to.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.477
That prescription
you called in, doc?

32:34.514 --> 32:35.915
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

32:37.149 --> 32:38.449
Your RX number.

32:38.484 --> 32:40.201
<i>Uh, yes, I have</i>
<i>the prescription right here.</i>

32:40.236 --> 32:41.619
<i>Yes it's RX number...</i>

32:41.654 --> 32:43.705
0-0-2-3-0...
<i>0-0-2-3-0-1</i>

32:43.739 --> 32:45.039
1-1-5...

32:45.074 --> 32:46.291
1-1-9-8.

32:46.325 --> 32:49.994
22 tablets of phozerol.

32:50.028 --> 32:51.880
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>350 milligrams each.</i>

32:55.551 --> 32:57.868
350 milligrams each.

33:13.126 --> 33:16.178
(Elevator bell dings)

33:16.212 --> 33:17.763
In the storage locker,
just like you said.

33:17.814 --> 33:19.848
Good.
You need to go home.

33:19.882 --> 33:20.949
What about...

33:20.984 --> 33:22.150
Abby, Quinn, Olivia...
They're home.

33:22.185 --> 33:23.819
My friends and I need
some alone time.

33:27.874 --> 33:29.274
Hmm.

33:30.910 --> 33:32.127
(Button clicks)

33:37.366 --> 33:38.367
He got there in time?

33:38.401 --> 33:39.868
He got there in time.

33:41.002 --> 33:42.770
Oh, thank God.
Hallelujah.

33:42.804 --> 33:44.205
Terrific.

33:44.239 --> 33:48.175
So... now it's just a matter
of tying up loose ends.

33:48.209 --> 33:49.143
No.

33:49.177 --> 33:50.761
All right, if you won't, I will.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.147
No, Charlie, you won't.

33:53.181 --> 33:56.384
Uh, there's this girl I like.
Her name is...

33:56.385 --> 33:58.786
You know what? I'm not gonna
tell you what her name is

33:58.820 --> 34:00.638
because you're all like me.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.523
We shouldn't know
each other's weaknesses,

34:02.541 --> 34:05.759
but I like her,

34:05.793 --> 34:07.494
and she's good.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.512
She doesn't ask
a lot of questions,

34:09.547 --> 34:12.665
but I know her really well,
'cause she's normal.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.819
But she will never know me.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.038
I'm a soldier.

34:18.072 --> 34:20.690
Technically, we are soldiers.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.442
We served our country,

34:23.275 --> 34:24.543
but nobody gets to know that.

34:24.578 --> 34:26.946
There's no parade.
There are no medals.

34:27.181 --> 34:30.666
So we come home and we try
to have normal lives,

34:30.699 --> 34:32.467
but what is normal?

34:32.502 --> 34:35.004
I really, really like...

34:35.054 --> 34:36.621
Killing people.

34:36.656 --> 34:38.090
It's...

34:38.125 --> 34:39.809
beautiful.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.127
Right?

34:41.561 --> 34:43.328
They taught us to love it,

34:43.362 --> 34:45.731
and then they took it away
and they left us with...

34:45.764 --> 34:47.666
Melvin just wanted someone to know.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.319
He wanted to stop pretending
to be something he wasn't.

34:50.353 --> 34:54.739
He just wanted to feel free,
to feel normal.

34:54.774 --> 35:00.596
And wouldn't we all give
anything to feel normal?

35:04.751 --> 35:07.586
Melvin's just...

35:07.604 --> 35:09.738
He's one of us.

35:13.293 --> 35:14.943
(Sighs)

35:16.178 --> 35:18.863
Mm. Hippie-dippie huck.

35:18.897 --> 35:20.464
Who knew?

35:20.498 --> 35:22.483
(Grunts) I'd wished
you'd gone all Oprah

35:22.517 --> 35:25.019
before you whipped out
that drill last...

35:25.253 --> 35:26.870
(Gunshot)

35:28.323 --> 35:29.973
It was a nice speech, Spin.

35:30.008 --> 35:31.842
Really.

35:35.112 --> 35:36.697
We better start
cleaning up.

35:36.731 --> 35:38.365
(Paul) I got some plastic
bags in the car.

35:38.416 --> 35:39.433
I'll see if I can find some rags.

35:39.467 --> 35:41.184
(Charlie)
I'll get the oil drum.

36:15.285 --> 36:17.453
You're still here.

36:17.487 --> 36:18.854
(Sighs deeply)

36:19.589 --> 36:21.523
I don't want to know what
happened. Don't tell me.

36:21.557 --> 36:23.525
I just care that you're still here.

36:23.559 --> 36:25.627
I couldn't handle it if...

36:31.384 --> 36:34.552
You're important to me.

36:34.887 --> 36:37.105
It's short for "spinster."

36:37.139 --> 36:38.673
What is?

36:38.707 --> 36:39.824
"Spin."

36:39.858 --> 36:43.010
That's where the nickname came from.

36:43.045 --> 36:45.913
They never thought
I'd meet somebody.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.734
(Exhales)

36:52.068 --> 36:53.252
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

36:53.253 --> 36:54.955
(Rustling)

36:57.158 --> 36:59.759
Abby. I waited up for you,
but you never...

36:59.793 --> 37:01.411
Abby?

37:02.696 --> 37:04.764
Abby, what are you...

37:04.798 --> 37:06.233
Pretty sure it's here.
I just have to find it.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.118
Find what, Abby?

37:09.569 --> 37:11.487
Abby, talk to me.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.122
Got it.

37:13.156 --> 37:15.040
Abby?

37:15.058 --> 37:17.793
Okay, yeah, let's talk.

37:17.828 --> 37:20.563
Teresa Dunn... 37 years old...

37:20.614 --> 37:23.466
Although when you met her,
she was much younger.

37:23.517 --> 37:24.967
She worked at
the Georgetown tavern

37:25.002 --> 37:26.736
when you were in law school.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.654
You asked her out
on several occasions.

37:28.672 --> 37:31.958
Finally, she said yes.
You dated for three months.

37:31.992 --> 37:34.260
What does my ex from
20 years ago have to do with...

37:34.294 --> 37:36.946
Hospital photos of
Teresa Dunn's injuries.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.047
(Clicking)

37:38.098 --> 37:39.565
Where did you get those?

37:39.599 --> 37:40.816
Hard to find,
what with you being

37:40.868 --> 37:43.169
a powerful A.U.S.A. and all
and the son of a judge.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.170
What, did daddy clear your record

37:45.205 --> 37:46.305
so you could pass the bar?

37:46.339 --> 37:48.540
She fell down
a flight of stairs.

37:48.575 --> 37:50.609
(Sighs) She fell.
She fell?

37:50.643 --> 37:51.777
We were having an argument,
yes, but she took off

37:51.811 --> 37:53.595
and fell down those stairs.
She fell.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.563
I didn't touch her.

37:54.614 --> 37:56.331
Hmm. Where have
I heard that before?

37:56.366 --> 37:59.518
(Pounds table)
Oh, yes, I "fell," too.

37:59.552 --> 38:00.552
(Clicking)

38:01.670 --> 38:03.571
- Oh, Abby.
(Crying) - Best part of this

38:03.605 --> 38:06.007
is that <i>this</i> photo of me...

38:06.041 --> 38:09.360
I found it here in your pile
of investigative crap!

38:09.394 --> 38:11.712
Did you investigate me before
you slept with me or after?

38:11.763 --> 38:13.347
Before.
Before we ever met at that bar.

38:13.382 --> 38:15.499
I was investigating everyone
at Pope and Associates.

38:15.533 --> 38:16.617
You know that.

38:16.652 --> 38:19.503
But you only slept with one...
The stupid one,

38:19.538 --> 38:21.772
the vulnerable one who wouldn't
know she was being used,

38:21.790 --> 38:23.641
because she has
terrible taste in men.

38:24.775 --> 38:26.476
You realize you're
talking crazy right now.

38:26.510 --> 38:27.861
I never touched Teresa Dunn.

38:27.912 --> 38:29.663
Ask her.
Find her and ask her.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.532
I met her for coffee last night!

38:32.584 --> 38:36.687
She was telling me stuff...
Stuff I wouldn't have believed.

38:36.721 --> 38:38.805
But I was looking
right in her eyes,

38:38.840 --> 38:41.208
and she was crying,

38:41.242 --> 38:42.893
and I felt it in my gut.

38:42.927 --> 38:45.829
Like Olivia says,

38:45.863 --> 38:48.665
- your gut tells you everything
you need to know. - Yeah.

38:49.699 --> 38:52.418
Abby, Teresa Dunn is lying,

38:52.452 --> 38:55.071
and I don't know why,
but that's not what upsets me.

38:55.105 --> 38:57.757
What upsets me is that you
haven't even given me a chance.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.174
It hasn't even occurred to you

38:59.192 --> 39:00.793
that I might be worth
the benefit of the doubt?

39:00.844 --> 39:02.912
You're a bad guy.

39:02.946 --> 39:05.748
You look like a good guy,
but you're not!

39:05.782 --> 39:07.099
I gave you a drawer.

39:07.134 --> 39:08.584
Oh!

39:08.602 --> 39:11.871
If you touch me again, I will
kill you, and I mean that.
