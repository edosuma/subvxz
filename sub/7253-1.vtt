For the meeting

13:14.502 --> 13:16.879

13:16.879 --> 13:19.840

13:16.879 --> 13:19.840
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.676

13:46.493 --> 13:48.869
NOW THAT YOU'RE STAYING HERE,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.869

14:42.674 --> 14:44.425
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,

14:44.425 --> 14:46.260
DON'T TELL THE MAID.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.260
THEY TELL THEIR CHILDREN,

14:46.260 --> 14:48.388
THEN THEIR CHILDREN GROW UP

14:46.260 --> 14:48.388
AND ROB YOU.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.807
NOW, IS THIS ALL YOUR THINGS, OR

14:48.388 --> 14:50.807
IS THERE MORE STILL AT SCHOOL?

14:50.807 --> 14:55.520
UH, NO, I HAVE

14:50.807 --> 14:55.520

14:59.566 --> 15:02.276
I BOUGHT IT

14:59.566 --> 15:02.276
AT AN ORGANIC BAKERY.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.362
SO HOW'D IT GO

15:02.276 --> 15:04.362
LAST NIGHT?

15:04.362 --> 15:07.156
HMM?

15:04.362 --> 15:07.156
WITH MOM. WAS SHE MAD?

15:07.156 --> 15:10.951
I MEAN, OF COURSE SHE WAS MAD,

15:07.156 --> 15:10.951
BUT WAS IT A BAD MAD?

WE BETTER GET YOU

15:44.944 --> 15:46.279
IN THAT BATH.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.655

15:46.279 --> 15:47.655
THERE WAS AN INTERCOM.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.198
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.811

THE FIRST THING

16:59.811 --> 17:01.312
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

17:01.312 --> 17:03.105
IS I'M GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE

I NEED TO TALK TO LORELAI.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.697
WHERE IS SHE?

24:08.697 --> 24:11.158
LORELAI, WHERE ARE YOU?!

24:08.697 --> 24:11.158
Lorelai: WHO'S THAT?

24:11.158 --> 24:13.286
IT'S PARIS, AND I NEED TO TALK

24:11.158 --> 24:13.286
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.954
WHO ARE YOU?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.954
I TRIED TO TELL YOU --

24:14.954 --> 24:17.415
PARIS! HEY.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.415
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:17.415 --> 24:18.874
ARE YOU BUSY?

24:17.415 --> 24:18.874
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.500
NO, WE'RE JUST GETTING READY

24:18.874 --> 24:20.500
TO GO OUT.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.420
IT'S FINE.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.420
HAVE YOU MET LUKE?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.420
NO.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.297
I'M LUKE.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.297
PARIS.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.464
NICE TO --

24:24.297 --> 24:26.464
RORY'S QUITTING YALE.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.464
I JUST WENT TO SEE HER,

24:26.464 --> 24:27.841
AND SHE TOLD ME

24:26.464 --> 24:27.841
SHE'S QUITTING YALE.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.385
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.385
YES, I DID.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.553
IT'S LOGAN.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.553
THAT CHRISTOPHER ATKINS WANNABE

24:31.553 --> 24:33.806
IS THE REASON THAT SHE'S

24:31.553 --> 24:33.806
SUDDENLY BLUE-LAGOONING IT

24:31.553 --> 24:33.806
RIGHT OUT OF SCHOOL.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.474
PARIS --

24:33.806 --> 24:36.474
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.474
WHY ARE YOU LETTING HER DO IT?

24:36.474 --> 24:38.227
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.227
YES, YOU DO.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.478
YOU CAN STOP HER. YOU CAN PULL

24:38.227 --> 24:40.478
SOME OF THAT SUPERMOM CRAP

24:40.478 --> 24:42.356
THAT YOU ALWAYS DO

24:40.478 --> 24:42.356
AND GET HER TO CHANGE HER MIND.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.774
YUP.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.774
RORY CAN'T QUIT YALE.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.359
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.359
I AGREE.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.361
I MEAN, WE SHOULD KIDNAP HER,

24:45.359 --> 24:47.361
DRAG HER BACK HERE,

24:47.361 --> 24:49.863
AND TIE HER UP,

24:47.361 --> 24:49.863
AND NOT LET HER LOOSE

24:47.361 --> 24:49.863
UNTIL SHE LISTENS TO REASON.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.990
YES.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.990
LUKE.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.490
HEY, MY SUGGESTION FIRST.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.368
I NEED HER TO BE

24:52.490 --> 24:54.368
AT YALE.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.078
RORY'S BEEN MY ONLY

24:54.368 --> 24:56.078
REAL COMPETITION

24:56.078 --> 24:57.663
SINCE SHE SHOWED UP

24:56.078 --> 24:57.663
AT CHILTON.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.457
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

24:57.663 --> 24:59.457
WHO'S EVER CHALLENGED ME.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.834
SHE'S MY PACE CAR.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.834
SHE'S MY BJORN BORG.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.502
WITHOUT HER, I'LL GET LAZY.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.502
I'LL FALL APART.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.464
I'LL HAVE FROSTED HAIR

25:04.502 --> 25:06.464
AND DRAGON-LADY NAILS.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.466
I'LL ACHIEVE NOTHING.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.466
I'LL BECOME MY MOTHER.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.800
PARIS, LISTEN TO ME.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.719
YOU ARE A VERY SMART, DRIVEN

25:09.800 --> 25:12.719
YOUNG LADY.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.972
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT,

25:12.719 --> 25:14.972
EXCEPT A DIPLOMAT.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.514
YOU DON'T NEED RORY

25:14.972 --> 25:16.514
TO PUSH YOU.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.851
RORY'S MY ONLY FRIEND.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.851
SHE STAYS IN THE ROOM

25:18.851 --> 25:20.602
UNTIL I'M COMPLETELY DONE

25:18.851 --> 25:20.602
SAYING SOMETHING.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.521
I NEED THAT.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.521
LISTEN, I KNOW I'M NOT RORY,

25:23.521 --> 25:26.733
BUT IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO

25:23.521 --> 25:26.733
SOMEONE, YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME.

25:26.733 --> 25:27.943
REALLY?

25:26.733 --> 25:27.943
YEAH.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.611
I'LL GIVE YOU

25:27.943 --> 25:29.611
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.240
IT'S BASICALLY MY LIFELINE.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.240
YOU TAKE IT, AND YOU USE IT.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.408
I CAN REALLY CALL YOU?

25:34.408 --> 25:36.410
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.953
I'M GONNA HOLD YOU TO THAT.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.288
OKAY.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.288
IT'S NOT A THREAT, SWEETIE,

25:39.288 --> 25:40.831
IF SOMEBODY MAKES

25:39.288 --> 25:40.831
THE OFFER WILLINGLY.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.375
OKAY.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.375
THANKS.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.252
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.252
BYE, LUKE.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.671
NICE TO M--

25:47.671 --> 25:50.132
THAT CONCLUDES THE FLOOR-SHOW

25:47.671 --> 25:50.132
PORTION OF THE EVENING.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.051
I'LL GET MY PURSE,

25:50.132 --> 25:52.051
AND WE'LL GO.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.388
[ SIGHS DEEPLY ]

25:55.388 --> 25:57.056
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

25:55.388 --> 25:57.056
ABOUT WHAT?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.224
YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.224
NOTHING.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.475
COME ON.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.475
COME ON. LET'S JUST GO.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.893
NO. WE HAVEN'T TALKED

25:59.475 --> 26:00.893
ABOUT THIS.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.186
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING

26:00.893 --> 26:02.186
TO TALK ABOUT.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.770
YES, THERE IS.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.770
LUKE.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.689
THIS IS RORY'S DECISION,

26:03.770 --> 26:05.689
OKAY?

26:05.689 --> 26:08.025
SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW I FELT

26:05.689 --> 26:08.025
ABOUT THE SITUATION,

26:08.025 --> 26:10.110
AND SHE CHOSE TO IGNORE ME,

26:08.025 --> 26:10.110
SHE CHOSE TO MOVE IN WITH

26:08.025 --> 26:10.110
MY PARENTS.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.320
SHE CHOSE NOT TO TELL ME

26:10.110 --> 26:11.320
ABOUT IT.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.946
SHE'S A KID.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.946
SHE'S NOT A KID.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.199
SHE'S 20. SHE'S GONNA BE 21

26:12.946 --> 26:15.199
IN OCTOBER.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.117
SHE'S BEEN LIVING ON HER OWN

26:15.199 --> 26:17.117
FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.203
SHE'S NOT A KID.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.203
OKAY, FINE, BUT SHE'S YOUNG.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.664
AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TO BE

26:19.203 --> 26:22.664
ALLOWED TO MAKE MISTAKES.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.166
I MADE A MUCH BIGGER MISTAKE

26:22.664 --> 26:24.166
THAN THIS

26:24.166 --> 26:26.544
WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.544
OH, SO WHAT?

26:26.544 --> 26:28.628
JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE IT

26:26.544 --> 26:28.628
ON YOUR OWN, RORY HAS TO, ALSO?

26:28.628 --> 26:30.297
THAT'S NOT MY POINT.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.297
WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

26:30.297 --> 26:32.758
MY POINT IS THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE

26:30.297 --> 26:32.758
LISTENED TO ANYONE

26:32.758 --> 26:35.428
IN THAT SITUATION, EVEN IF THERE

26:32.758 --> 26:35.428
WAS SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.389
I HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT,

26:35.428 --> 26:38.389
AND RORY HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.015
NOW, SHE'S SMART,

26:38.389 --> 26:40.015
AND SHE'S STRONG,

26:40.015 --> 26:41.892
AND HOPEFULLY

26:40.015 --> 26:41.892
SHE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.561
BUT I AM NOT GONNA FORCE

26:41.892 --> 26:43.561
MY WAY IN.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.312
IF SHE WANTS TO BE ON HER OWN,

26:43.561 --> 26:45.312
FINE. SHE'S ON HER OWN.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.646
REALLY?

26:45.312 --> 26:46.646
TOUGH LOVE, BABY.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.191
SO, THAT'S IT?

26:46.646 --> 26:49.191
THAT'S IT.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.359
AND YOU'RE OKAY

26:49.191 --> 26:50.359
WITH THIS?

26:50.359 --> 26:53.195
I'M TOTALLY OKAY

26:50.359 --> 26:53.195
WITH THIS.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.573
COME ON, LET'S GO.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.573
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STARVING.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.660
DID YOU GIVE PARIS

26:57.866 --> 27:00.660
YOUR REAL CELL NUMBER?

27:00.660 --> 27:03.997
MY BEST SLOTH YEAR, I BELIEVE,

27:00.660 --> 27:03.997
WAS SOPHOMORE YEAR.

27:03.997 --> 27:07.209
I WENT TO SPAIN FOR A WEEK

27:03.997 --> 27:07.209
TO IMMERSE MYSELF IN CERVANTES.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.586
WOUND UP STAYING FOR TWO MONTHS

27:08.586 --> 27:10.588
AND ALMOST JOINED

27:08.586 --> 27:10.588
THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.466
BUT YOU WERE IN SPAIN.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.466
YES, BUT SINATRA DIDN'T SING

27:13.466 --> 27:14.967
ABOUT THE SPANISH

27:13.466 --> 27:14.967
FOREIGN LEGION.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.802
COULD YOU PASS ME

27:14.967 --> 27:16.802
THREE PEANUTS?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.053
TWO MONTHS IS NOTHING.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.637
OH, SO YOU THINK

27:18.053 --> 27:19.637
YOU CAN OUTDO ME?

27:19.637 --> 27:22.766
FRESHMAN YEAR -- 4 1/2-MONTH

27:19.637 --> 27:22.766
CROSS-COUNTRY ROAD TRIP.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.642
THIS WAS "PRE" NAVIGATIONAL

27:22.766 --> 27:24.642
ASSISTANCE, PEOPLE.

27:24.642 --> 27:27.104
JUNIOR YEAR, I DROPPED MY THINGS

27:24.642 --> 27:27.104
OFF AT MY DORM ROOM,

27:27.104 --> 27:29.398
JUMPED ON A PLANE TO AUSTRALIA,

27:27.104 --> 27:29.398
AND SURFED UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.941
YOU DID NOT.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.941
I DID.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.776
WHERE WAS I?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.776
IN CLASS,

27:30.941 --> 27:32.776
LIKE A GOOD LITTLE BOY.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.070
AMAZING. THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVING

27:32.776 --> 27:35.070
A LOSER-OFF.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.573
OH, LOOK HOW SHE MOCKS -- THE

27:35.070 --> 27:37.573
GIRL WHO STAYED HOME FOR A MONTH

27:37.573 --> 27:39.366
AFTER SHE HAD

27:37.573 --> 27:39.366
A TRAGIC HAIRCUT.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.328
IT WASN'T A TRAGIC HAIRCUT.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.328
IT WAS APOCALYPTIC HIGHLIGHTS.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.537
I LOOKED LIKE

27:42.328 --> 27:43.537
A TIM BURTON CHARACTER.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.289
TWO MORE PEANUTS --

27:43.537 --> 27:45.289
LITTLE ONES.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.249
HEY, LOGAN, DO YOU REMEMBER

27:45.289 --> 27:47.249
THAT TIME YOU LEFT THE CLASSROOM

27:47.249 --> 27:49.126
TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE

27:47.249 --> 27:49.126
FOR THAT MOCK DEBATE,

27:49.126 --> 27:50.503
AND YOU ENDED UP

27:49.126 --> 27:50.503
IN ATLANTIC CITY?

27:50.503 --> 27:53.046
VAGUELY.

27:50.503 --> 27:53.046
NOW, THIS MAN HERE, MY DARLING,

27:53.046 --> 27:55.591
IS LONG-REIGNING KING

27:53.046 --> 27:55.591
OF THE SLOTHS.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.843
THAT'S RIGHT. NO ONE CAN

27:55.591 --> 27:57.843
WASTE TIME LIKE THIS MAN HERE.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.719
REALLY?

27:57.843 --> 27:59.719
NO. NOW, WHO WANTS A DRINK?

27:59.719 --> 28:01.805
OH, HE'S

27:59.719 --> 28:01.805
JUST BEING MODEST.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.307
LOGAN HAS THE TALENT

28:01.805 --> 28:03.307
FOR DOING NOTHING

28:03.307 --> 28:05.809
THAT'S YET TO BE MATCHED

28:03.307 --> 28:05.809
BY MAN OR ACTUAL SLOTH.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.770
OKAY, I FEEL A LIPSTICK CRISIS

28:05.809 --> 28:08.770
COMING ON. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.272
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.441
KING OF THE SLOTHS, HUH?

28:12.441 --> 28:15.027
I DON'T KNOW. THIS YEAR I MIGHT

28:12.441 --> 28:15.027
GIVE YOU A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.445
OH, REALLY?

28:16.445 --> 28:19.156
YES. ALL KINGS

28:16.445 --> 28:19.156
MUST BE DETHRONED EVENTUALLY,

28:19.156 --> 28:21.575
AND THIS YEAR

28:19.156 --> 28:21.575
THAT CROWN WILL BE MINE.

28:21.575 --> 28:25.204
ALL HAIL RORY GILMORE,

28:21.575 --> 28:25.204
FUTURE QUEEN OF THE SLOTHS.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.413
ALL HAIL.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.705
ALL RIGHT,

28:26.413 --> 28:27.705
TIME TO MAKE THE ROUNDS

28:27.705 --> 28:30.000
TO SEE WHICH ONE

28:27.705 --> 28:30.000
OF THESE LOVELY FEMALES

28:30.000 --> 28:32.336
IS SOUSED ENOUGH

28:30.000 --> 28:32.336
TO FIND MY ARROGANCE CHARMING.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.838
FINN, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

28:32.336 --> 28:34.838
ABOUT JUST WOOING A WOMAN --

28:34.838 --> 28:37.841
FLOWERS, CHOCOLATES, A LITTLE

28:34.838 --> 28:37.841
SLOW JAM IN THE BACKGROUND?

28:37.841 --> 28:40.177
SLOW JAMS

28:37.841 --> 28:40.177
ARE FOR THE SUBTLE, RORY.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.680
ONE TOO MANY

28:40.177 --> 28:42.680
HAS A DELIGHTFUL IMMEDIACY.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.224
YOU COMING, COLIN?

28:42.680 --> 28:45.224
ABSOLUTELY.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.229
I WONDER HOW BEER TASTES

28:47.976 --> 28:50.229
WITH ICE CREAM IN IT.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.315
I GIVE YOU ONE MONTH.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.315
TO DO WHAT?

28:53.315 --> 28:56.360
BEFORE YOU'RE BACK IN SCHOOL --

28:53.315 --> 28:56.360
ONE MONTH.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.695
YOU ARE WRONG.

28:57.695 --> 28:58.987
NOPE.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.989
OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE

29:00.989 --> 29:02.908
HOW LITTLE FAITH

29:00.989 --> 29:02.908
YOU HAVE IN ME.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.702
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF MATCH

29:02.908 --> 29:04.702
WOULD I BE FOR YOU

29:04.702 --> 29:08.955
IF I JUST WENT RUNNING RIGHT

29:04.702 --> 29:08.955
BACK TO A LIFE OF RESPECTABILITY

29:08.955 --> 29:11.958
WITHOUT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO JOIN

29:08.955 --> 29:11.958
THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION?

29:11.958 --> 29:13.627
YOU LOVE SCHOOL.

29:13.627 --> 29:14.545
NOT ANYMORE.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.505
NO!

29:14.545 --> 29:16.505
YOU LOVE SCHOOL.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.382
I SAW IT.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.382
THAT DOESN'T JUST GO AWAY.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.634
WELL, I HAVE REFORMED,

29:18.382 --> 29:20.634
ALL RIGHT?

29:20.634 --> 29:23.970
FROM NOW ON, NO MORE SCHEDULING,

29:20.634 --> 29:23.970
NO MORE PLANNING.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.558
I AM JUST GOING TO SPEND MY DAYS

29:23.970 --> 29:27.558
MAKING ICE-CREAM BEER FLOATS,

29:27.558 --> 29:29.226
AND JUST TAKING LIFE

29:27.558 --> 29:29.226
AS IT COMES.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.603
YOU'LL SEE -- NEW ME.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.563
IF YOU SAY SO.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.563
I DO SAY SO.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.481
COME ON, COME ON.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.481
I LOVE THIS SONG.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.525
WE NEED TO DANCE THE BOOZE OFF

29:34.481 --> 29:36.525
AND SOBER UP A LITTLE.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.611
OTHERWISE, ONE OF US

29:36.525 --> 29:38.611
IS GOING HOME WITH FINN.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.613
OH, THIS IS

29:38.611 --> 29:40.613
FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.615
TAKE HER.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.615
OKAY, SAVE MY SEAT

29:42.615 --> 29:45.158
AND ORDER ME

29:42.615 --> 29:45.158

29:45.158 --> 29:47.536
[ DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ]

29:50.872 --> 29:52.708
YOU HAVE A REALLY

29:50.872 --> 29:52.708
NICE PLACE HERE. REALLY.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.961
I SLEPT INCREDIBLE LAST NIGHT.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.961
I WOKE UP TO BIRDS SINGING.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.755
SERIOUSLY,

29:55.961 --> 29:57.755
THIS TOWN IS SO GREAT.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.715
I JUST HAD TO TAKE

29:57.755 --> 29:59.715
ONE LAST EARLY-MORNING RIDE

29:59.715 --> 30:01.258
AROUND THE TOWN

29:59.715 --> 30:01.258
BEFORE I CHECKED OUT.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.009
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL PEOPLE

30:01.258 --> 30:03.009
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.471
HMM. COULD YOU MOVE

30:03.009 --> 30:05.471

30:05.471 --> 30:07.973
HUH?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.973

30:07.973 --> 30:10.058
OKAY.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.935
UH, HI.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.270
SO HOW'S YOUR BILL LOOKING?

30:13.270 --> 30:15.522

30:15.522 --> 30:17.983

30:17.983 --> 30:20.569
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE

30:17.983 --> 30:20.569
HAVING YOU STAY WITH US.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.279
HAND ME AN ENVELOPE,

30:20.569 --> 30:22.279
AND DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.739
HE WAS SWEATING

30:22.279 --> 30:23.739
ALL OVER THE DESK.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.824
HE'S ALSO PAYING

30:23.739 --> 30:25.824
A $600 HOTEL BILL.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.577
I DON'T CARE.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.577
HE SMELLS. THEY ALL SMELL.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.497
THE WHOLE INN SMELLS LIKE SWEAT

30:28.577 --> 30:31.497
SOCKS AND DAMP NYLON SHORTS.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.206
IT'S MAKING ME SICK.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.959
I HAVE TO WORK AT THAT DESK,

30:33.206 --> 30:35.959
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION

30:35.959 --> 30:38.337
OF CATCHING JOCK ITCH

30:35.959 --> 30:38.337
ON MY FOREARM

30:38.337 --> 30:40.130
BECAUSE MR. "BREAKING AWAY"

30:40.130 --> 30:42.549
CAN'T SHOWER

30:40.130 --> 30:42.549
BEFORE HE INVADES MY SPACE.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.883
MICHEL, JUST CHILL OUT

30:47.179 --> 30:49.264
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO PICK UP

31:34.893 --> 31:37.771
LIKE A SERVANT.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.565
WHAT?

31:37.771 --> 31:39.565

31:42.609 --> 31:45.153
SHE'S NOT HERE?

31:42.609 --> 31:45.153

31:45.153 --> 31:47.781
I AM HERE AND NOT

31:45.153 --> 31:47.781

31:49.742 --> 31:52.285
WHEN I'M NOT BUSY

31:49.742 --> 31:52.285
ANSWERING DOORS LIKE BENSON.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.037
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.037
YOU GAVE HER MY MESSAGE?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.497
I GAVE HER YOUR MESSAGE,

31:55.497 --> 31:57.499

31:55.497 --> 31:57.499
OVER HERE AND LET YOU IN,

31:57.499 --> 31:59.251

31:59.251 --> 32:01.420
AND GIVING MY PAW

31:59.251 --> 32:01.420
FOR A LIVER TREAT.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.464

32:08.886 --> 32:10.888
WELL, THIS

32:08.886 --> 32:10.888
IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

32:10.888 --> 32:13.348
DOES SHE THINK

32:10.888 --> 32:13.348
THIS IS A FUNNY THING TO DO?

32:13.348 --> 32:16.518
I DRIVE ALL THE WAY

32:13.348 --> 32:16.518
FROM HARTFORD.

32:16.518 --> 32:17.895
SHE DID NOTHING.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.813
NOTHING'S PACKED.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.813
NOTHING'S READY TO GO.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.523
WHERE ARE

ARE YOU JUST GOING

32:25.402 --> 32:26.945

32:26.945 --> 32:30.156

32:30.156 --> 32:32.367
LIKE I NEED TO BE WATCHED,

32:30.156 --> 32:32.367
LIKE I'M A METH HEAD

32:32.367 --> 32:35.036

32:32.367 --> 32:35.036

32:35.036 --> 32:36.455
WELL, THIS IS

32:35.036 --> 32:36.455
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!

33:03.523 --> 33:04.942
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.942
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.192
IT'LL BE OVER

33:04.942 --> 33:06.192
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.193
THE COURT CALLS THE STATE

33:07.193 --> 33:08.904

34:27.733 --> 34:30.027
MISS GILMORE,

34:30.027 --> 34:32.195
THERE MUST BE

34:30.027 --> 34:32.195
CONSEQUENCES -- PERIOD.

34:32.195 --> 34:35.323
20 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

34:32.195 --> 34:35.323
WON'T DO IT.

34:35.323 --> 34:38.117
I'M ORDERING 300 HOURS

34:35.323 --> 34:38.117
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

34:38.117 --> 34:40.829
TO BE COMPLETED

34:38.117 --> 34:40.829
IN NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS

34:40.829 --> 34:42.539
AND ONE YEAR'S PROBATION.

34:42.539 --> 34:45.751
BUT I CAN'T DO 300 HOURS.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.460
I-I HAVE TO GET A JOB.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.546
WELL, ADD THAT

34:47.460 --> 34:49.546
TO YOUR LIST OF THINGS

34:49.546 --> 34:51.965
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

34:49.546 --> 34:51.965
BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO JOYRIDE

34:51.965 --> 34:53.759
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S BOAT.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.094
300 HOURS -- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.094
CHARLIE?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.973
NOW, ASSUMING THIS IS INDEED

34:56.094 --> 34:59.973
A ONE-TIME OCCURRENCE,

34:59.973 --> 35:01.767
AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS' TIME,

34:59.973 --> 35:01.767
MISS GILMORE

35:01.767 --> 35:04.310
CAN PETITION THE COURT TO HAVE

35:01.767 --> 35:04.310
THIS EXPUNGED FROM HER RECORD.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.354
RECORD?! SHE'S GOING TO HAVE

35:04.310 --> 35:06.354
A RECORD? OH, MY GOD!

35:06.354 --> 35:08.732
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING

35:06.354 --> 35:08.732
ABOUT A RECORD.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.732
RICHARD, PLEASE.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.401
DON'T "RICHARD, PLEASE," ME,

35:08.732 --> 35:11.401
YOU TWO-BIT DOUBLE-TALKER.

35:11.401 --> 35:12.611
WHO ARE YOU?

35:11.401 --> 35:12.611
SIT DOWN.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.904
I AM HER GRANDFATHER,

35:13.904 --> 35:15.989
RICHARD GILMORE,

35:13.904 --> 35:15.989
AND THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

35:15.989 --> 35:17.741
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HER GO

35:15.989 --> 35:17.741
WITH A PONYTAIL.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.201
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

35:17.741 --> 35:20.201
TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF, SIR.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.995
I WILL NOT

35:20.201 --> 35:21.995
RESTRAIN MYSELF.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.247
I WILL NOT STAND BY

35:21.995 --> 35:24.247
AND LET THIS GIRL WALK AROUND

35:24.247 --> 35:25.624
WITH A RECORD

35:24.247 --> 35:25.624
FOR FIVE YEARS.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.959
RICHARD, YOU'RE STANDING

35:25.624 --> 35:26.959
ON MY FOOT!

35:26.959 --> 35:28.627
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LISTENED

35:26.959 --> 35:28.627
TO YOU --

35:28.627 --> 35:31.254
MAKING DEALS WITH A 20-YEAR-OLD

35:28.627 --> 35:31.254
CHILD IN A CHEAP SUIT.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.214
HEY!

35:31.254 --> 35:33.214
I'M NOT DUTY-BOUND TO DO SO,

35:33.214 --> 35:35.216
BUT I'M HAPPY

35:33.214 --> 35:35.216
TO GIVE MISS GILMORE

35:35.216 --> 35:38.303
THE OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW

35:35.216 --> 35:38.303
HER PLEA AND GO TO TRIAL.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.640
IF SHE DOES SO, SHE'LL FACE

35:38.303 --> 35:41.640
ADDITIONAL FELONY CHARGES.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.182
GIVEN THE UNDISPUTED FACTS,

35:43.182 --> 35:46.019
I'D THINK VERY HARD

35:43.182 --> 35:46.019
ABOUT THAT COURSE OF ACTION.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.646
WELL, I THINK

35:46.019 --> 35:47.646
IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.397
GRANDPA, NO.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.397
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO TRIAL.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.650
I'LL DO THE COMMUNITY SERVICE.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.650
PLEASE, JUST SIT DOWN.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.110
RICHARD, SIT DOWN!

35:53.110 --> 35:54.987
I DO NOT WANT TO WITHDRAW

35:53.110 --> 35:54.987
MY PLEA, YOUR HONOR.

35:54.987 --> 35:59.116
ALL RIGHT. I WILL CONSIDER

35:54.987 --> 35:59.116
THIS MATTER SETTLED.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.743
COURT WILL RECESS

35:59.116 --> 36:01.743
FOR 20 MINUTES.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.997
Bailiff: ALL RISE.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.997
THIS IS NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.248
WE GOT A LITTLE MORE COMMUNITY

36:04.997 --> 36:07.248
SERVICE THAN WE WANTED.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.250
YOU'RE A LOUSY DUCK HUNTER,

36:07.248 --> 36:09.250
CHARLIE.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.670
IT WASN'T THE WEATHER,

36:09.250 --> 36:11.670
AND IT WASN'T THE DUCK CALL.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.796
IT WAS YOU.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.965
I WAS DOING YOU

36:12.796 --> 36:14.965
A FAVOR, RICHARD.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.258
WELL, DO ME

36:14.965 --> 36:17.258
SOME MORE FAVORS, CHARLIE.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.719
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THE GIRL

36:17.258 --> 36:19.719
20-TO-LIFE AT SING SING.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.179
THAT IS IT!

36:19.719 --> 36:21.179
GRANDPA --

36:21.179 --> 36:23.140
I'M HIRING A LAWYER

36:21.179 --> 36:23.140
TO SUE THAT MAN.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.391
GRANDPA, DID YOU TELL MOM

36:23.140 --> 36:25.391
ABOUT THE COURT DATE?

36:25.391 --> 36:27.769
OF COURSE I DID.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.769
YOU DID?

36:25.391 --> 36:27.769
YOU TOLD HER THE TIME

36:27.769 --> 36:30.229
AND WHERE IT WAS AND EVERYTHING?

36:27.769 --> 36:30.229
SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT, RORY.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.732
SHE SIMPLY SHOWED NO INTEREST

36:30.229 --> 36:32.732
IN THE MATTER.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.567
ABE ROSENSTEIN!

36:32.732 --> 36:34.567
WHO?

36:34.567 --> 36:36.778
THAT'S WHO I'M GONNA GET

36:34.567 --> 36:36.778
TO SUE CHARLIE.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.655
GOODBYE, EMILY.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.782
GO TO HELL, RICHARD.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.826
I'M NOT THROUGH

36:40.782 --> 36:42.826
WITH YOU YET.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.327
RICHARD,

36:42.826 --> 36:44.327
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM HERE.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.996
WE'RE IN A COURTHOUSE.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.429
[ SIGHS ]

37:06.224 --> 37:08.185
<i>LORELAI, IT'S YOUR MOTHER.</i>

37:06.224 --> 37:08.185

<i>BRAGGING ABOUT,</i>

37:14.816 --> 37:17.485
<i>THEIR DAUGHTERS DID THIS</i>

37:14.816 --> 37:17.485

37:17.485 --> 37:20.405
<i>WELL, FINALLY I GET TO GO</i>

37:17.485 --> 37:20.405
<i>IN THERE AND SAY, "OH, REALLY?</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:23.408
<i>"TODAY MY DAUGHTER INVITED ME</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:23.408
<i>OVER AND THEN DIDN'T SHOW UP.</i>

37:23.408 --> 37:26.536
<i>"AND THEN SHE HAD ME WATCHED</i>

37:23.408 --> 37:26.536

37:27.913 --> 37:29.414
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU OVER,

37:29.414 --> 37:30.665
<i>"TOP THAT, LADIES."</i>

<i>DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR,</i>

37:32.458 --> 37:35.170

37:35.170 --> 37:37.797

37:37.797 --> 37:39.174
<i>I WILL READ THEM TO YOU.</i>

37:39.174 --> 37:40.967
<i>I MADE COPIES.</i>

37:40.967 --> 37:44.512
<i>"DEAR LORELAI, I WAS SHOCKED</i>

37:50.852 --> 37:52.311
MY GOD!

37:52.311 --> 37:55.398
THERE. THAT'S ALL OF HER STUFF.

37:52.311 --> 37:55.398
YOU HAPPY?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.442
LORELAI, YOU SCARED ME HALF

37:55.398 --> 37:57.442
TO DEATH.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.402
YEAH, WELL, FOLLOW-THROUGH --

37:57.442 --> 37:59.402
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY PROBLEM.

37:59.402 --> 38:04.241
OH, WELL. UM, SO WE'VE GOT

37:59.402 --> 38:04.241
CLOTHES, BOOKS, STUFFED ANIMALS.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.952
I EVEN CHECKED THE LAUNDRY

38:04.241 --> 38:06.952
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS WAITING

38:04.241 --> 38:06.952
TO BE WASHED.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.746
OKAY? WE GOOD?

38:06.952 --> 38:09.746
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BARGING IN HERE

38:06.952 --> 38:09.746
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

38:09.746 --> 38:11.790
ARE YOU CRAZY?

38:09.746 --> 38:11.790
MOM JUST SEEMED

38:09.746 --> 38:11.790
EXTREMELY CONCERNED

38:11.790 --> 38:13.208
ABOUT GETTING THE REST

38:11.790 --> 38:13.208
OF RORY'S THINGS.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.043
SHE NEEDED SOMETHING

38:13.208 --> 38:15.043
TO WEAR TO COURT.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.212
YEAH, SO I FIGURED I'D BETTER

38:15.043 --> 38:17.212
BRING THEM RIGHT OVER HERE.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.380
AND NOW I DID, SO I'M DONE.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.380
LORELAI, STOP THIS.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.591
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.591
I KNOW YOU HATE US, BUT --

38:21.591 --> 38:23.260
I DON'T HATE YOU.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.260
WHY WOULD I HATE YOU?

38:23.260 --> 38:26.930
WELL, BECAUSE WE --

38:23.260 --> 38:26.930
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT WE --

38:26.930 --> 38:29.266
YOU WERE JUST BEING YOU.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.266
YOU COULDN'T HELP IT.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.433
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:30.433 --> 38:32.018
THE SCORPION AND THE FROG --

38:32.018 --> 38:34.437
IT'S AN OLD STORY.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.437
THE SCORPION SAYS TO THE FROG,

38:34.437 --> 38:37.107
"HEY, FROG, GIVE ME A LIFT

38:34.437 --> 38:37.107
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POND."

38:37.107 --> 38:39.567
THE FROG SAYS, "NO WAY.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.567
YOU'LL STING ME, AND I'LL DIE."

38:39.567 --> 38:41.694
THE SCORPION SAYS, "WILL NOT,

38:39.567 --> 38:41.694
'CAUSE THEN WE'D BOTH DROWN."

38:41.694 --> 38:43.071
THE FROG SAYS, "COOL."

38:43.071 --> 38:44.781
SO THE SCORPION GETS

38:43.071 --> 38:44.781
ON THE FROG'S BACK,

38:44.781 --> 38:46.616
AND THE FROG MAKES IT

38:44.781 --> 38:46.616
TO THE MIDDLE OF THE POND,

38:46.616 --> 38:47.867
AND THE SCORPION

38:46.616 --> 38:47.867
STINGS HIM.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.452
AS THE FROG IS GOING DOWN,

38:47.867 --> 38:49.452
HE SAYS,

38:49.452 --> 38:51.746
"WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.746
NOW WE'LL BOTH DIE."

38:51.746 --> 38:54.540
THE SCORPION SAYS,

38:51.746 --> 38:54.540
"SORRY. IT'S JUST MY NATURE."

38:54.540 --> 38:55.834
FROG. SCORPION.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.586
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

38:57.210 --> 38:58.586
IT WAS A TURTLE.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.088
WHATEVER IT WAS.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.088
YOU GUYS COULDN'T HELP IT.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.215
LORELAI, WHY DON'T YOU SIT

39:00.088 --> 39:02.215
AND CALM DOWN?

39:02.215 --> 39:03.716
I AM CALM.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.716
I'M FINE.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.343
YOU GUYS MUST BE

39:03.716 --> 39:05.343
PRETTY JAZZED, THOUGH, HUH?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.262
I MEAN, YOU FINALLY DID IT.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.262
YOU FINALLY GOT A SHOT

39:07.262 --> 39:09.181
AT GETTING THE DAUGHTER

39:07.262 --> 39:09.181
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.183
I'M TOO TIRED

39:09.181 --> 39:11.183
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.392
RORY -- HERE, RIGHT UNDER

39:11.183 --> 39:13.392
YOUR ROOF -- EXCELLENT.

39:13.392 --> 39:15.061
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

39:15.061 --> 39:18.815
NOW YOU GET YOUR DO-OVER --

39:15.061 --> 39:18.815
A NEW-AND-IMPROVED LORELAI.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.192
CONGRATS.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.192
VERY WELL-PLAYED.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.986
LORELAI, LISTEN TO ME.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.238
I KNOW YOU THINK

39:22.986 --> 39:25.238
THAT SOME SORT OF CON

39:25.238 --> 39:26.364
HAS BEEN PERPETRATED ON YOU.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.991
HEY, IT'S ONLY

39:26.364 --> 39:27.991
A PAPER MOON, DAD.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.951
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

39:27.991 --> 39:29.951
YOUR MOTHER AND I WERE JUST

39:29.951 --> 39:31.577
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.579
WE'RE ALL STRIVING

39:31.577 --> 39:33.579
FOR THE SAME GOAL.

39:33.579 --> 39:35.748
WE WANT RORY HAPPY

39:33.579 --> 39:35.748
AND HEALTHY.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.417
SHE'S TAKEN A BIT OF A STUMBLE,

39:35.748 --> 39:38.417
BUT WE CAN GET HER BACK

39:38.417 --> 39:41.004
ON THE RIGHT TRACK --

39:38.417 --> 39:41.004
ALL OF US, TOGETHER.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.672
AND WE'RE GOING

39:41.004 --> 39:42.672
TO NEED YOUR INPUT

39:42.672 --> 39:45.258
AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT

39:42.672 --> 39:45.258
TO ACHIEVE THAT.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.969
MY INVOLVEMENT ENDS HERE

39:45.258 --> 39:47.969
WITH THE LAUNDRY BASKET.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.637
WHAT IS THAT FLIP REMARK
