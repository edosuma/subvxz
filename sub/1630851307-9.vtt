WEBVTT

00:00.174 --> 00:02.219
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:02.263 --> 00:03.220
-Hi, Captain Sandy.
-Hi!

00:03.264 --> 00:04.787
Welcome back.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.571
Jennifer and Patrick hope
the crew can transform the boat

00:06.615 --> 00:08.399
into their own
Oktoberfest celebration.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.922
-Yes!
-Yeah!

00:09.966 --> 00:11.707
There's our costumes.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.578
What I'd like to do
when we get to dinner,

00:13.622 --> 00:16.712
drop the German flair and just
make a ----ing awesome dinner.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.193
So, my schnitzel
and chill is gone.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.679
Okay, I...

00:27.723 --> 00:30.552
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the down!

00:30.595 --> 00:32.902
-I will you up.
-Go to bed!

00:32.945 --> 00:35.818
I'm just gonna ask you
to give her another chance.

00:35.861 --> 00:38.647
Invest in her, and if
it doesn't work for you,

00:38.690 --> 00:40.301
I will let her go.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.650
This trip I'm gonna
have you on breakfasts,

00:41.693 --> 00:43.521
and you're on lates.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.437
I don't want Katie to, like,
give Courtney more second stew

00:46.481 --> 00:48.700
duties just because
she doesn't like me.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.528
I'm not gonna punish Courtney
by taking her off service

00:50.572 --> 00:53.488
to keep Lexi happy,
because this is how it works...

00:53.531 --> 00:54.619
we rotate.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.273
Let's do this.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.841
It looks like you're
at a silent disco.

00:58.884 --> 01:02.236
I feel comfortable about being
100 percent myself on this boat.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.934
You're definitely out
of booze, so that's a problem.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.327
I don't like that noise.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.850
We're missing plates.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.330
Can we get some plates?

01:09.373 --> 01:10.505
Are they not on the table?

01:10.548 --> 01:11.593
Negative, there's nothing there.

01:11.636 --> 01:12.637
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.686
Oh, I wasn't done.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.340
When I was trying to finish,
I was doing juicing,

01:19.383 --> 01:20.689
I was doing, like,
20 different things,

01:20.732 --> 01:21.907
so I didn't finish it.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.477
I forgot to put the plates
and cutlery down, so that sucks.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.566
Lexi was
starting our room earlier,

01:28.610 --> 01:29.828
when I went to change into
my suit this morning...

01:29.872 --> 01:31.395
-Okay.
-And she never came back.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.484
I can't be having
my second stewardess

01:33.528 --> 01:35.704
failing at
the most simplest task.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.532
How is it?

01:37.575 --> 01:39.011
I will take responsibility and
I will take the brunt of it.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.796
-Just don't give up.
-We'll get there.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.842
I have to rely on Katie to
be able to navigate her stews.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.584
Now, if she can't, then
that's when I have to step in.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.737
This dock is crazy.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.868
Hey.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.392
I'll have a Corona with lime.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.393
-That's easy.
-Yeah, sure.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.698
That'd be great, thanks.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.483
Also, Lexi was starting
our room earlier,

02:15.526 --> 02:16.701
when I went to change into
my suit this morning...

02:16.745 --> 02:17.702
-Okay.
-And she never came back.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.313
Okay.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.705
So it's, like, the cleaners
and everything

02:20.749 --> 02:21.924
are still in there, and
there's no towels.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
There isn't?
Okay, no worries.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.797
-Yeah. I'll send her in.
-Okay, thanks.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.626
Go ahead.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.020
Can you just check that there's
towels in the twin cabin?

02:31.063 --> 02:32.456
All right, I'll check and see.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.457
Thank you.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.460
[bleep]'s sakes.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.766
-Diane.
-Yeah?

02:37.809 --> 02:38.941
-How's the water?
-It's nice.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.421
It's really nice.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.423
All crew, all crew,
lunch is ready.

02:42.466 --> 02:46.470
Let's get all this sh--
put away, and then...

02:47.906 --> 02:49.386
Breakfast go good?

02:49.430 --> 02:51.345
They loved it,
so that's a great...

02:51.388 --> 02:52.389
that's the start I wanted.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.826
That gives me more confidence.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.959
That gives me
more confidence.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.917
I thought yesterday
was the best day ever,

02:58.961 --> 03:00.876
but it's actually today.

03:00.919 --> 03:05.576
This is my first charter where
I didn't leave the boat or quit.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.318
I feel like
I'm finally getting my footing.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.667
Oh, this quiche is good.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.162
What?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.642
It's my mom's birthday.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.947
Holy sh--.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.299
Don't even know
what date it is.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.605
I've gone through
this whole day being so consumed

03:34.649 --> 03:37.434
about the charter guests
and Lexi not pulling her weight

03:37.478 --> 03:41.351
that I nearly forgot
my own mother's birthday.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.310
I'm, like,
nearly 30 years old,

03:43.353 --> 03:45.703
and she'll call me
her sugarplum fairy.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.879
When I do go home,
she'll always be like,

03:47.923 --> 03:49.141
"This is your birthday
present

03:49.185 --> 03:50.795
and this is
your Christmas present,"

03:50.839 --> 03:52.319
because I'm born
on Christmas day.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.799
But she still tries to
separate it because

03:54.843 --> 03:56.497
she ----ed up and got pregnant,

03:56.540 --> 03:58.368
and then I was born
on Christmas day.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.891
So, maybe she still feels bad
about that, I don't know.

04:02.677 --> 04:03.634
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

04:03.678 --> 04:04.809
Thanks so much.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.811
If you bring that bucket
of champagne

04:06.855 --> 04:09.423
in to Maureen for
those ladies, they'll love it.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.388
Anyone wanna try
anything else... hydrofoil?

04:23.175 --> 04:24.351
We could do it on the sundeck.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.395
That's what I was thinking.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.483
We've got pretzel things.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.876
Cute.

04:27.919 --> 04:28.964
We'll set up, like,
the snacks on the table.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.792
Yeah.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.402
So, I would cruise around and
get used to the throttle first.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.970
There you go, yes.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.495
Is this empty?
Yes, it is.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.062
So, what are we supposed
to be doing after this?

04:40.105 --> 04:41.368
Well, we're gonna
get suited up...

04:41.411 --> 04:42.412
-Lederhosen and...
-Right.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.892
Oktoberfest.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.939
Have you ever been?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.680
Yes, I backpacked
through Germany

04:49.724 --> 04:51.987
and we started at Oktoberfest
to kick it off, yeah.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.467
-There you go.
-It was epic.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.643
I honestly blacked out,
so I don't really

04:55.686 --> 04:58.341
remember the whole night,
but huge beers,

04:58.385 --> 05:01.866
like, big pretzels,
everyone's screaming or puking,

05:01.910 --> 05:03.564
like, falling asleep
in the street...

05:03.607 --> 05:04.695
it was epic.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.480
-So, you know.
-Yeah.

05:07.742 --> 05:08.830
Hey, those are fun.

05:09.961 --> 05:10.919
Where are the girls?

05:10.962 --> 05:12.399
So, that one...

05:12.442 --> 05:13.443
So, we've got these,
and then...

05:13.487 --> 05:14.618
-Very nice.
-Yeah.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.054
Are you going to the room?

05:16.098 --> 05:17.055
Yeah, I'm gonna take
a shower really quick...

05:17.099 --> 05:18.709
Okay.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.058
And then I'll meet you
guys back out here.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.147
They want all of us to
join in for Oktoberfest.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.888
Yeah, I'll join in
from 10:00 till...

05:23.932 --> 05:27.414
Sober Oktoberfest.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.545
I'm trying to think...
maybe like a Corona.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.764
Yeah, of course.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.461
Can I get something
for you also?

05:31.505 --> 05:32.462
-Yeah, of course.
-Can I get a Tito's and tea?

05:32.506 --> 05:34.595
-Yeah.
-Mimosas?

05:34.638 --> 05:37.206
Will you please get a couple of
Coronas to the swim platform?

05:37.249 --> 05:39.382
And can we add
two glasses of champagne

05:39.426 --> 05:40.557
to that drinks order
as well, please?

05:49.000 --> 05:49.958
Sure.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.612
Z, be gentle.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.744
I thought that was your lady?

05:53.788 --> 05:55.267
We can call her Courtney
if you want.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.184
I don't like these
people anymore,

05:59.228 --> 06:01.099
because they just keep
asking me for sh--.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.884
Just remember, we're never
gonna see these people again.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.930
No, I know, but I think,
like, I just hate when you feel

06:05.974 --> 06:07.236
like you've failed at your job.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.803
I know, and I...

06:08.846 --> 06:10.195
That's exactly how I feel today.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.110
Honestly, I completely get it.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.461
It's hard, because
it falls on me, you know?

06:14.504 --> 06:15.940
Yeah, for sure.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.246
I'm doing my job.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.943
Yeah, it makes you feel
like sh--.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.603
-Oh!
-Oh, my God, sorry!

06:27.604 --> 06:28.692
Oh sh--.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.088
Coming up, a sneak peek at
what's ahead this season.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.916
Do I wanna spend an
extra five minutes,

06:34.959 --> 06:36.613
and the fish getting cold
and overcooked?

06:36.657 --> 06:37.919
I'm not that guy.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.269
I'm, um, backup chef
for you guys.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.017
Oh!

06:49.060 --> 06:50.235
Oh, my God, sorry!

06:57.025 --> 06:58.853
Oh, okay, yeah.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.514
Okay, that's ----ed.

07:08.863 --> 07:09.994
-Champagne?
-Mm-hmm, thank you.

07:10.038 --> 07:13.258
You're welcome.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.522
Malia, Mzi.
Shall I deflate the slide?

07:15.565 --> 07:17.785
-Yeah, good initiative. <i>
-Copy that.</i>

07:19.351 --> 07:21.223
When I was down
there to shower,

07:21.266 --> 07:23.312
there were no towels,
so then I didn't have a robe

07:23.355 --> 07:24.748
-so I came out in your room.
-Mm-hmm.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.054
Lexi walked in when
I was naked...

07:26.097 --> 07:27.708
-Yeah?
-And then walked back out.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.884
So, hopefully we'll have towels.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.320
Okay, German food.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.887
There will be
a little Oktoberfest.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.280
We're gonna do brats
and pretzels,

07:35.324 --> 07:38.066
and then a fancy dinner...
lamb on a puree.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.024
Dessert is crème brûlée.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.113
Mm, how did you get
so good at everything?

07:42.157 --> 07:44.855
I worked for this really
rich, powerful man,

07:44.899 --> 07:47.554
and he had a team of chefs
in his corporate kitchen,

07:47.597 --> 07:49.251
and I learned a lot
from those guys.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.861
Were they from all
over the world?

07:50.905 --> 07:52.036
Yeah.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.298
From a young age,
I hated school,

07:53.342 --> 07:55.083
and the vice principal
said to me,

07:55.126 --> 07:56.780
"Maybe it's best
if you just drop out."

07:56.824 --> 07:58.608
That's when my mom said,
"You know, as long as

07:58.652 --> 08:00.567
you make the world
your classroom."

08:00.610 --> 08:02.873
So, I dropped out of school
when I was 16,

08:02.917 --> 08:06.224
studied in Mexico learning
traditional Mexican cooking.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.922
I took pastry courses in France.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.576
I went to Thailand

08:09.619 --> 08:11.708
and studied with the top chef
there for a month.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.275
I took courses in Vietnam,

08:13.318 --> 08:16.104
and I really just pursued
my craft my own way.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.975
You're giving me a big ego now.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.803
You deserve it.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.806
Lloyd, the guests wanna do
this Oktoberfest thing, right?

08:22.850 --> 08:25.766
But I feel like we need
someone to, like, hype it,

08:25.809 --> 08:27.158
and I think you would be
the perfect person for that.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.159
Oh!

08:28.203 --> 08:29.813
This is awesome.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.076
I get to use some of
my skills of guiding people

08:32.120 --> 08:34.252
around Europe and
showing them a great time.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.645
I've been to Oktoberfest twice.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.255
I know exactly
the party they want.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.910
Get some chants going.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.132
Just being your normal self.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.743
It's what you're born to do.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.962
All right, let's go.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.267
Katie, do you take breaks?

08:49.311 --> 08:50.878
Like, why are we...
we only see you.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.183
Sometimes.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.750
Not sometimes, I just said
we only see you.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.099
She's like, "I work my ass off."

08:55.143 --> 08:56.666
I wanna look after my girls.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.841
-You deserve a break.
-Good Lord.

08:57.885 --> 08:58.929
-It's, like...
-Thank you.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.801
I'm... I'm honestly fine.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.324
Okay.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.934
Sometimes it's just better
to power on through,

09:03.978 --> 09:05.327
because if you stop
then you're like, mm.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.111
So, it kinda works.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.287
I'll have some more champagne
when you get a sec.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.288
-Yeah, of course.
-And a Tito's and tea for me.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.725
Sure.

09:11.768 --> 09:12.987
I don't know if
Lloyd mentioned it.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.815
When this charter's over...

09:20.342 --> 09:21.343
Okay.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.661
If you really hate something,

09:34.704 --> 09:37.011
you tend to, like,
I guess not give it your all.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.801
Let's get this
stuff packed away,

09:44.845 --> 09:46.368
and then once they're ready,
we'll see...

09:46.411 --> 09:47.891
We're gonna get suited up.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.415
-All right.
-Lederhosen and beerfesting.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.939
Heh.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.337
What time is the Oktoberfest?

09:59.381 --> 10:00.817
Maybe like an hour?

10:00.861 --> 10:02.819
Courtney is setting up upstairs.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.342
Mm, meh.

10:04.386 --> 10:07.041
All right, sweet, guys.
Let's close this transom.

10:07.084 --> 10:10.174
I don't know if it's too
tall or not,

10:10.218 --> 10:11.828
NautiBuoy presents.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.351
Too bad it's not NautiGirl.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.005
-Just kidding.
-Girl!

10:17.747 --> 10:19.183
I'm sorry for being grumpy.

10:19.227 --> 10:21.838
You're not grumpy,
you're ----ing amazing.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.101
Don't worry, every
trip's gonna be hard.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.325
All crew, can everyone
be ready in their outfits

10:30.368 --> 10:31.892
for a quarter past 5:00?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.807
Okay, copy.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.417
I'm headed down, and then
yeah, you're good to change.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.376
Cute!

10:38.420 --> 10:40.509
Oh, God, it's so see-through I
have to wear hot pants under it.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.729
Oh, my gosh, I love it.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.818
I don't know any German words...
danke.

10:44.861 --> 10:45.862
Sheisse...
yeah, sheissen.

10:45.906 --> 10:46.863
Sheissen... sheissen

10:46.907 --> 10:50.258
-Sh--.
-Yeah.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.390
Ooh, is that sauerkraut?

10:52.434 --> 10:53.565
Yep...

10:53.609 --> 10:54.566
Damn, girl.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.090
All right...

10:56.133 --> 10:57.352
I'm waiting for someone
to sauer my kraut.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.527
That doesn't even
sound appealing.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.182
Courtney's gonna be so sexy.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.056
Katie, can I get
a dirty vodka martini?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.841
Sure, sorry about your room
this morning as well.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.277
Oh, no, it's okay, don't worry.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.192
And you guys have towels
and everything now, right?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.715
-Yes, yes.
-Lexi went in just before.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.325
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.981
Oh, goodness gracious.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.251
It feels great to be a real boy.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.426
Goodness gracious me.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.427
-Hello!
-Yes!

11:29.471 --> 11:31.908
-Hi!
-You look so cute!

11:31.952 --> 11:33.301
Oh, danke schoen.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.131
I look like an elf.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.093
Thank you so much.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.269
You're welcome.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.097
Thank you so much,
appreciate it.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.098
Do you guys wanna run this up?

11:48.142 --> 11:50.100
It looks so good.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.493
Should I put this on?

11:55.932 --> 11:59.936
You guys look adorable,
oh, my God, I love it.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.590
You having fun?

12:01.633 --> 12:03.461
Not not having fun,
I'm just not having fun-fun.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.898
Hey, how's it going with Lexi?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.377
Ugh, not good.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.075
It's in the wrong way.
Who did this cabin?

12:08.118 --> 12:09.554
Lexi.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
-Can we get some plates?
-Are they not on the table?

12:11.426 --> 12:12.383
Negative, there's nothing there.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.820
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.865
Lexi was starting
our room earlier,

12:15.909 --> 12:17.084
when I went to change into
my suit this morning...

12:17.127 --> 12:18.650
-Okay.
-And she never came back.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.131
I can't be in a million places
at once, you know?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.394
I'm trying, and it's failing me.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.136
Need some help in the interior?

12:26.180 --> 12:27.616
Is that a possibility?

12:27.659 --> 12:29.313
Like, I got
this girl in quarantine,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
we have an extra bed.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.882
I mean...

12:32.926 --> 12:34.144
Because you know, the deck
team are getting

12:34.188 --> 12:35.276
their 12 hours of rest,
I'm just saying.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.843
That's not happening on my team.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.149
-Can I think about it?
-Sure.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.936
Coming up...

12:42.979 --> 12:44.328
Anyone order a beer?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.463
Yes!

12:48.506 --> 12:50.334
Woo!

12:54.251 --> 12:56.906
because when the first thing
happened with the chef,

12:56.950 --> 12:58.386
I got backup.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.301
She's already getting paid.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.477
She's just sitting in a hotel
when we could put her to work,

13:02.520 --> 13:04.087
and we have an extra bunk.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.915
And it helps you,
because you know,

13:05.959 --> 13:07.264
the deck team are getting
their 12 hours of rest.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.005
That's not happening on my team.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.833
Wanna bring her on?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.443
-Can I think about it?
-Absolutely.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.445
I mean, let me run
it past the girls

13:14.489 --> 13:15.838
to get their thoughts on it.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.145
-Sure.
-I appreciate that.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.450
I don't know how
I feel about this.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.104
I will talk to you soon,
Captain Sandy.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.410
Okay.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.933
Lexi is not really
pulling her weight,

13:23.977 --> 13:25.979
so we can use the
extra hands for sure.

13:26.022 --> 13:29.896
But I don't want to say
anything to her to hurt her,

13:29.939 --> 13:31.811
because from what I've seen,

13:31.854 --> 13:34.074
I don't think Lexi deals
with things in a good way.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.466
I don't want her to rebel.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.338
I just want us to get
through this charter,

13:37.381 --> 13:39.427
which is proving to be the
hardest charter we've been on

13:39.470 --> 13:41.559
so far because
of all this sh--.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.998
It's just... I feel like
it's gonna be a messy road.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.521
-Hello?

13:46.564 --> 13:47.914
Hi.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.480
Hi, do you wanna jump
into the master?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.048
Thank you.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.485
It's my time to shine.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.313
Well, have a nice evening.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.839
-Do you wanna head upstairs?
-Yeah.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.144
-All right.
-Cool, let's go.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.277
Oh, yeah!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.453
Woo!

14:05.496 --> 14:06.541
Look honey, he's got the white
sausage.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.542
That's my favorite!

14:07.585 --> 14:10.980
-Woo!
-Yeah!

14:11.024 --> 14:13.113
Yes, Mzi!

14:13.156 --> 14:14.288
Did anyone order a beer?

14:14.331 --> 14:16.507
-Oh, yeah!
-Yay!

14:16.551 --> 14:18.858
Hey!

14:25.952 --> 14:27.475
It's so much more fun.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.956
Can you, like, surprise me
with a yummy vodka cocktail?

14:29.999 --> 14:32.001
Of course.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.047
Oh, my God, it's so good up
there, they love it.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.875
I have to surprise her with
a yummy vodka cocktail.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.093
Quick, make her a cosmopolitan.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.312
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.227
-Do you know how to make one?
-No.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.319
Yeah.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.538
Triple sec, cranberry juice,
vodka, lime,

14:47.582 --> 14:50.150
and just shake it and serve
it in a martini glass.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.542
Does anyone else need a beer?

14:54.284 --> 14:55.329
I love it.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.463
-Cheers, bitches!
-Oh!

15:01.074 --> 15:03.032
Thank you, you are the best.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.513
How's it going?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.167
Yeah, good, good.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.603
All the decorations have stayed,
which is plus.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.607
Okay, but then I have
to come back down.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.176
-I didn't get an outfit.
-What?

15:16.219 --> 15:17.525
Oh, Captain Sandy!

15:17.568 --> 15:18.918
I love your outfits!

15:18.961 --> 15:20.354
-Woo!
-Captain, my captain!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.358
Yeah, of course.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.370
Yeah, but we... she wants
you up there for a bit.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.415
It's fun.
Honestly, go, it's nice.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.203
I wanna be a part
of the festivities,

15:43.246 --> 15:44.682
but it's an unfair tradeoff.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.380
I did all the cabins' laundry,

15:46.423 --> 15:48.730
and then if I go up there
for Oktoberfest,

15:48.773 --> 15:50.384
now I'm stuck cleaning
up after you guys,

15:50.427 --> 15:52.255
after you've had fun
with the guests.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.388
I'd rather be in cabins,
finish it off.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.606
Thank you.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.566
-Hey!
-Yes!

15:58.609 --> 16:00.002
Look at you!

16:00.046 --> 16:01.264
-Oh, my God.
-Loving it?

16:01.308 --> 16:02.396
Yes.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.356
I'm definitely at a point
where I would prefer

16:06.400 --> 16:08.097
a steady and
healthy relationship,

16:08.141 --> 16:09.881
and obviously with Malia,
it's not gonna happen.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.539
And it's fine, like,
I can live with that,

16:15.583 --> 16:18.107
but the realization that
I am just spooning a pillow,

16:18.151 --> 16:19.979
just feeling sorry for myself

16:20.022 --> 16:21.632
because it's not a human being,

16:21.676 --> 16:23.721
it is what it is, isn't it?

16:23.765 --> 16:26.420
I will see you in a few hours.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.726
-All righty.
-Somebody hold my beer.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.513
We need more people!

16:32.556 --> 16:33.557
Oh, my God.

16:34.689 --> 16:35.646
...but she said no.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.605
Okay.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.781
Everyone's having fun upstairs,
and she's isolating herself.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.652
I don't want her
to feel isolated.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.741
Like, what else can I do?
I'm trying.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.048
-Drink!
-Hey!

16:46.092 --> 16:50.139
Woo!

16:50.183 --> 16:53.751
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

16:53.795 --> 16:57.146
Attaboy, Mzi!
That's my boy!

16:57.190 --> 17:00.062
I do have some experience in
the beer-drinking department.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.109
We used to host an
annual beer Olympics

17:03.152 --> 17:05.633
at the digs that I used
to live at in Cape Town.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.027
I feel like I'm quite shy
and reserved,

17:08.070 --> 17:12.553
and alcohol can definitely
change that up a little bit.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.729
My friends at home would
be extremely disappointed

17:14.772 --> 17:16.339
in me right now.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.430
Yeah.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.176
How are you feeling after
everything that's happened?

17:27.220 --> 17:28.612
I'm feeling better.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.354
I'm just, like, taking
my time, you know?

17:31.398 --> 17:33.008
You're very quiet,
so I just wanna make sure...

17:33.052 --> 17:34.444
-Oh, yeah, I feel good.
-That you're still...

17:34.488 --> 17:36.011
-I'm good, I'm getting back.
-Okay.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.752
Tomorrow, breakfast will
be set first thing.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.059
Yeah, it just
can't happen again.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.756
There's one other thing.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.063
We had another girl
that quarantined.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.586
Uh-huh?

17:45.629 --> 17:46.804
Basically she's just sitting
there doing nothing.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.111
Okay.

17:49.155 --> 17:52.680
I'm feeling very anxious about
bringing in another person.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.683
Okay.
What's her position?

17:55.726 --> 17:59.165
I don't know her experience,
but I just want you to know

17:59.208 --> 18:00.818
this is not me trying
to replace you...

18:00.862 --> 18:02.168
-Okay.
-After everything.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.386
Because I know how
it can seem...

18:03.430 --> 18:04.561
-Right.
-And how it can look.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.302
And I genuinely mean it,
Lexi, like,

18:06.346 --> 18:07.782
please believe me
when I say that.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.740
-Okay. No, I understand.
-We do have an extra bunk.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.046
We have an extra bed?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.656
In the boys' cabin.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.310
They've got three beds.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.095
Well, I appreciate it.
I'm not offended at all.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.705
Okay, I just...

18:19.185 --> 18:21.143
I think it will help us,

18:21.187 --> 18:22.753
but I am concerned
about the dynamic.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.103
All righty.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.249
-Okay.
-All righty.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.729
-Thank you.
-No problem.

18:41.772 --> 18:42.817
-I'm gonna finish putting up...
-Yeah, yeah.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.123
Crew stuff.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.343
Oh ----ing Chad.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.389
-Yes!
-Woo!

18:51.130 --> 18:52.653
I have the best deck crew.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.176
They're dancing around,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.352
just making absolute
fools of themselves.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.137
Woo!

18:58.180 --> 19:00.269
There's no egos here,
there's no cockiness.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.706
Willkommen zum Oktoberfest!

19:02.750 --> 19:05.405
Best night ever.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.754
Lloyd!

19:09.757 --> 19:12.455
Apparently we had a girl
on standby,

19:12.499 --> 19:15.284
so, that's quarantined,
so because she's sitting

19:15.328 --> 19:17.852
in quarantine doing nothing,
I think we can use the help.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.506
What's she's coming as?

19:19.549 --> 19:20.724
I mean, I don't know,
but I wanna keep her,

19:20.768 --> 19:23.379
like, more down.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.380
I'm not going down to fourth.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.729
You're not, no, no.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.430
Well, that's another thing,
is cabin arrangements.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.563
No, I don't know.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.869
Obviously we need the help,
but we need the help

19:34.912 --> 19:36.697
because Lexi isn't
doing her job.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.569
So, really, she should just
be coming on to replace Lexi.

19:39.613 --> 19:40.788
This is ----ing annoying.

19:43.573 --> 19:44.922
Coming up...

19:44.966 --> 19:46.446
Being business owners,
I just figure, like,

19:46.489 --> 19:50.232
you would want to know
experiences that we had.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.626
We felt like there was
a little lack of attention.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.719
We had a girl on standby.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.112
I think we can use the help.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.679
What is she coming on as?

20:02.723 --> 20:04.290
I mean, I don't know,
but I wanna keep her, like,

20:04.333 --> 20:07.075
more down.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.555
Well, that's another thing,
is cabin arrangements.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.512
You guys missed the dance-off.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.471
Oh, what's going on?

20:11.514 --> 20:16.432
We got a girl in quarantine,
and the boat's paying for her,

20:16.476 --> 20:19.392
so she might come on for
next trip, I don't know.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.263
I think maybe
it's time to go to dinner.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.438
Do you know what time
we're having dinner?

20:22.482 --> 20:23.439
We're actually eating dinner.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.006
I will double-check for you now.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.964
-Should we do beer?
-Sleeping arrangements?

20:27.008 --> 20:29.750
David goes in with the boys, and
then someone goes in with Mat.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.273
Someone goes in with Mat.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.188
Lexi should have to go with Mat.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.407
Just kidding...
don't do that.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.669
No, they do not...

20:35.712 --> 20:37.279
I'm just joking, don't do that.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.324
We'll be back
to three stews and no chef.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.673
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.631
Katie, what time are
they eating dinner?

20:41.675 --> 20:44.330
Well, apparently 9:00ish, but
I don't know, are they hungry?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.679
They would like to know.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.376
He's not gonna be...

20:50.161 --> 20:51.075
<i>Galley.</i>

20:51.119 --> 20:52.947
How long do you need for dinner?

20:52.990 --> 20:53.948
<i>-Twenty minutes.</i>
-Okay.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.428
<i>You want me to go in 20,</i>

20:55.471 --> 20:57.212
<i>or are you gonna call me
when the guests--</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:58.561
No, they were just asking
so I'm just making sure.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.259
<i>-Katie, I love you.</i>
-Bye.

21:04.437 --> 21:05.786
You guys are hungry?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.309
We're ready whenever
you guys are.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.137
So, Cheffy needs 20 minutes.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.444
If he's good at, like, 8:35?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.489
8:35 is good for everybody?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.665
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.191
I will say this...
smells like God is cooking.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.457
-Galley.
-Hello, Galley.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.155
-What up, baby?
-Be ready for 8:35?

21:27.198 --> 21:28.199
-Cool, bye.
-Bye.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.463
The plans are always changing.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
You just gotta roll with it.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.597
When we get to dinner, have it
be, like, a real badass dinner.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.685
Okay.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.470
-Instead of German food.
-Yes!

21:37.513 --> 21:39.298
It's a huge compliment
when someone loves your food

21:39.341 --> 21:41.038
so much that they want you
to keep doing your thing.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.301
When people give
me that feedback,

21:42.344 --> 21:44.085
I really wanna crush it.

21:44.128 --> 21:48.045
Potato gratin, Matatouille,
and rack of lamb persillade.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.265
Mzi, if you want to,
you can go down now.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.224
-Ooh!
-Thank you.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.487
Ooh, lamb lollipops.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.576
So, for your main course tonight

21:56.619 --> 22:00.188
you have a potato gratin
with ratatouille

22:00.231 --> 22:01.407
and a New Zealand rack of lamb.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.408
Ooh, thank you.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.366
Looks amazing.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.150
I think that's how you have
to eat it, it's a lollipop.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.369
Oh, my God.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.501
You're supposed
to hold the bone.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.545
This is so good.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.679
Thanks.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.507
If you wanna get some
extra sleep, you can.

22:14.550 --> 22:15.638
Oh, my God, yeah.

22:15.682 --> 22:16.726
Are those scalloped potatoes?

22:16.770 --> 22:18.337
That's crazy good.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.471
-All right, bye.
-Bye.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.343
Great, okay, wait till
you see my tattoo.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.650
-Oh, God.
-What... I know!

22:27.694 --> 22:29.478
She just scared herself.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.567
Apparently we had sex in
our bathroom that night.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.439
Oh!

22:37.399 --> 22:39.053
That might be a win
for the boys.

22:42.491 --> 22:45.102
-Ah!
-Oh.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.629
-Can I start brûléeing?
-You may.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.326
You're coming up
with the last two.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.501
Why?
Do I make them horny?

22:52.545 --> 22:54.242
You do.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.548
You know we might be getting
a fourth stew, right?

22:55.591 --> 22:57.114
Yeah?

22:57.158 --> 23:00.204
-She might be your cabin mate.
yeah.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.685
Oh, great ----ing timing!

23:02.729 --> 23:04.383
-Yes, sir!
-My man! Woo!

23:04.426 --> 23:06.385
That's vanilla crème brûlée.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.516
We all wanna take you home.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.691
I'm ready to go.

23:08.735 --> 23:09.866
Mat, you've been spot-on.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.607
-Okay.
-Thank you very much.

23:11.651 --> 23:12.608
This is the best crème
brûlée I've ever had.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.218
-Yes.
-Oh, awesome.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.219
-Crème brûlée is my favorite.
-Ooh!

23:15.263 --> 23:16.220
Oh, my gosh.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.221
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.310
Oh... huh, "is it good."

23:19.354 --> 23:21.138
What's going down?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.194
I don't wanna go to bed.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.630
We'll sleep when we're dead.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.547
-All right. Let's go.
-Perfect.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.506
This is a lot of stairs.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.464
I'm not gonna lie, babe, I'm not
gonna last too much longer.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.639
Okay, good night.

23:48.905 --> 23:49.863
-You good?
-Yeah.

23:49.906 --> 23:50.907
-Cool.
-Thank you.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.300
Thanks, chica.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.271
Good morning.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.272
Morning.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.273
How was your night?

24:09.317 --> 24:10.318
Yeah, good.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.234
Oh, my God.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.671
Hey, Lloyd, we're gonna
need the fenders,

24:15.715 --> 24:18.152
because I'm gonna get ready
to go into the marina.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.809
We're gonna need everybody.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.767
We're gonna need
all hands on deck.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.553
We have to haul anchor and
head right back to the dock.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.303
Wind's picking up already, huh?

24:39.347 --> 24:41.175
Oh, hell, yeah.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.306
I had the guys prep everything
last night, so we're ready.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.656
-Oh.
-On top of it.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.660
Captain Sandy, good morning,
we are hauling.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.534
-Anchor in the pocket.
-Thank you.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.493
What height do you
want the fenders?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.668
Just at the red rail.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.321
Red rail, yeah.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.323
Please just double-check
all your heaving lines.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.804
that's hot,
Jesus.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.154
All right, we can
throw fenders over.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.681
Laundry, great.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.690
Okay, all clear
to start swinging.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.343
Hundred feet to dolphin.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.431
Holy sh--.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.520
Dang.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.912
The current's wicked.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.960
----ing currents.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.396
Incredible.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.398
Port dolphin
approaching midships.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.357
<i>Dave, hurry?</i>

25:33.401 --> 25:34.794
<i>All port lines running now.</i>

25:34.837 --> 25:38.275
Okay, Captain Sandy,
we have 25 feet to the dock.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.278
Oops.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.325
We have tension in port dolphin.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.370
Okay, lock it off there.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.329
<i>-Nice work, everyone.</i>
-Yah.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.374
That was not easy.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.811
-Nice docking.
-Thank you.

25:51.854 --> 25:52.899
It's getting easier, isn't it?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.596
-Yeah, it is.
-Killing it.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.557
I guess.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.999
So, two more minutes.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.261
Is this empty?

26:09.524 --> 26:10.743
Hello?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.702
Do you want anything?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.704
-Well, since you're doing it...
-Yeah?

26:15.748 --> 26:17.619
Here we go, wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.579
Can I get you anything else?

26:20.622 --> 26:21.710
I'm good for the moment.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.494
-Hello.
-Hi.

26:23.538 --> 26:24.713
No guests are up.

26:24.757 --> 26:25.758
There's so much pulp.
Look at that...

26:25.801 --> 26:26.759
it's, like, not moving.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.803
It's like a lava lamp.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.589
I know, right?

26:34.462 --> 26:35.637
Good morning, sunshine.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.552
Oh, good morning, everybody.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.901
Don't be mad at me,
but I made my own drink.

26:38.945 --> 26:39.989
That's fine.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.687
Sorry, I couldn't find you.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.906
Joke's on me, because I
got the very pulpy OJ, so...

26:43.950 --> 26:45.604
There you go,
you should have waited.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.605
I should have.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.955
Or yelled louder.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.740
One thing after another
at this point.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.307
It's obviously clear
to the guests

26:53.350 --> 26:54.438
that we're failing in our job.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.962
Would anyone like a coffee?

26:56.005 --> 26:56.963
You have my tea-maker
back there, right?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.747
Yes, we do, yes.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.836
I go upstairs, and the primary's
pouring his own drink...

27:00.880 --> 27:03.491
super ----ing unacceptable.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.449
Because you were downstairs when
you should have been upstairs,

27:05.493 --> 27:07.930
yet you told me that there
were no guests upstairs,

27:07.974 --> 27:10.454
and that's why you
were downstairs.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.455
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.456
You're welcome.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.893
Would anyone else like a coffee?

27:13.936 --> 27:15.677
No.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.681
-How you doing?
-Good, how are you?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.640
<i>-Galley.</i>

27:21.683 --> 27:23.424
All right, thank you.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.339
Okay, I'm gonna finish
this scone I was nibbling on.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.908
Oh, something smells
so good in there.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.083
It's my swagger.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.650
Are you doing lobster bennie?

27:31.693 --> 27:32.651
Yeah, two ways.

27:32.694 --> 27:33.956
That looks phenomenal.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.131
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.655
Did you guys have
fun last night?

27:36.698 --> 27:38.482
-Yeah.
-We had a lot of fun.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.483
From what we remember.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.789
Yeah, the crew was awesome.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.095
How was the chef?
Like, how was his food?

27:42.138 --> 27:43.618
-Oh, my gosh. Unreal.
-Oh, my God.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.706
I know why he's smiling
all the time.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.665
-He's incredible.
-Yeah.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.362
If I was that good of a chef,
I'd smile all the time, too.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.668
-There wasn't one bad thing.
-He has one meal left.

27:49.711 --> 27:50.756
I wonder if he can
blow it with eggs?

27:52.583 --> 27:54.498
Just say "corner" when
you're walking up the stairs,

27:54.542 --> 27:55.978
to make sure no one hits you
and drops that, all right?

27:56.022 --> 27:57.023
-Yeah.
-Corner.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.677
Is this the lobster Benedict?

28:00.853 --> 28:02.028
Thank you.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.378
Lobster Benedict.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.640
-Ooh!
-Oh, wow.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.946
-Oh, my gosh.
-Yeah, that'll do.

28:06.989 --> 28:07.947
-That's a go.
-Yeah.

28:07.990 --> 28:08.948
Appreciate it.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.123
Corner!

28:10.166 --> 28:11.341
And we have a ham Benedict
as well.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.473
-Mathew?
-Yes?

28:12.516 --> 28:13.604
They were singing your praise.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.519
Were they?
That's good.

28:15.563 --> 28:18.871
I guess I can't say I don't
like eggs Benedict anymore.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.829
Should I butter the toast, or
do you have it on the table?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.613
-It's on the table.
-Of course it is, Katie.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.093
Perfection's her charm.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.573
-Are we doing a shot, or what?
-Yeah, ready?

28:25.616 --> 28:26.879
-Cheers to a good week.
-Cheers!

28:26.922 --> 28:28.141
-Yes, cheers.
-And friends.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.533
I feel like I gotta go pack.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.752
Has everyone else
already started?

28:30.796 --> 28:31.753
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna head down.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.059
Lexi, Lexi, Katie.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.061
Do you wanna come help me
clear breakfast?

28:35.104 --> 28:36.715
Copy.

28:38.891 --> 28:41.154
Ugh!
It's so heavy.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.373
Vacation over.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.853
They already finished
eating everything.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.812
All crew, all crew,
please get into your whites

28:46.855 --> 28:49.510
and let's meet on the dock
in five minutes.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.077
Lloyd, let's do this.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.387
Get in there, Mzi.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.434
Just four Chads, hanging out.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.522
Hey, you.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.003
Come on, come on, boy.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.047
On the line.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.833
I meant to say "on the wall."

29:07.876 --> 29:09.095
Thank you.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.532
Oh, wait... reposition.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.707
Wait, I gotta be
able to, like...

29:12.751 --> 29:13.752
Can I hug you?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
Yeah, of course you can.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.842
-So fun.
-Lovely to meet you too.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.408
Aw, thank you.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.717
Bye!
Thank you.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.414
I'm so glad you guys
could party with us.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.807
-Thanks for everything.
-You're welcome.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.069
-Appreciate it.
-Thanks for chartering.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.855
Yes, thanks again
for an amazing trip.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.857
This was our second time
doing something like this

29:31.900 --> 29:33.119
with you, Sandy, and
it turned out great.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.861
But being business owners,

29:35.904 --> 29:39.560
I just figured, like, you would
want to know experiences

29:39.603 --> 29:43.825
that we had that we think we
could maybe improve on a little.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.784
We felt like there was a little
lack of attention for us.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.655
I actually had to make
my own drink this morning.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.745
They're not wrong.
There were ups.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.660
I'm livid right now.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.535
I felt like there was
a little lack of attention.

29:58.579 --> 29:59.798
I actually had to make my
own drink this morning.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.103
I don't wanna be negative...

30:01.147 --> 30:02.801
Oh, no, you're...
honestly, thank you.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.804
Your saving grace
is right there.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.022
Mat's food was ridiculous.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.023
We're gonna kidnap him.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.720
It was amazing.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.592
Deck crew, you guys are badass.
You took care of us.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.680
There were just those
moments where it felt

30:12.723 --> 30:13.724
like I couldn't find anybody.

30:13.768 --> 30:14.813
Thanks for the feedback.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.031
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.032
-Yeah.
-Here's for the best part.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.033
Awesome, awesome.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.513
There you go.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.688
Ugh, it's so heavy...
thank you.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.689
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.125
Bye.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.127
Let's get out of our whites,
into our reds,

30:25.171 --> 30:26.650
and meet in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.130
-Woo!
-Cool.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.045
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

30:32.613 --> 30:33.701
No, you know what...

30:35.834 --> 30:38.097
Katie, what did he mean that he
had no one to mix him a drink?

30:38.140 --> 30:40.708
This morning when I came up,
they were all up.

30:40.751 --> 30:41.970
Oh.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.977
To be pinpointed
out of the whole crew

30:49.021 --> 30:50.849
that your department is failing,

30:50.892 --> 30:53.329
and it really comes
down to one person.

30:53.373 --> 30:56.680
If one of my stews up,
it comes to me.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.247
Oh, my God.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.249
Captain Sandy's gonna think
I'm a ----ing idiot

31:00.293 --> 31:02.251
if I don't accept
the extra help.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.905
I feel like
my hands are tied.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.167
Shall we talk a second?

31:05.211 --> 31:08.867
Okay... uh-oh.

31:08.910 --> 31:13.001
Um, my gut's telling me no,
but she's here.

31:13.045 --> 31:16.700
We've been paying her,
I can use the help.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.964
I don't want another complaint
like I had last charter.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.009
We might as well try,
and if it doesn't work,

31:21.053 --> 31:22.010
it doesn't work.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.142
Great.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.143
-Four days to...
-Yeah.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.536
-...have a shot.
-Okay.

31:26.580 --> 31:30.192
-If there's anything...
-Then whatever you need.

31:30.236 --> 31:31.977
Allowing Katie to
make that decision

31:32.020 --> 31:35.197
is about her seeing
that I believe in her.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.025
She's been a chief stew
for a long time.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.897
She's had eight girls under her.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.724
Like, she's got this.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.770
-Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.731
<i>All crew, all crew,
meet in the main salon</i>

31:47.775 --> 31:49.081
<i>for our tip meeting.</i>

31:49.124 --> 31:51.213
Opa!

31:51.257 --> 31:52.911
Thank you, darling.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.914
So, I mean,
we're mid-charter season,

31:55.957 --> 31:58.133
we had our first complaint.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.875
I like to call this
constructive criticism.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.746
As a business owner,

32:02.790 --> 32:05.706
he highlighted the things that
we really need to improve on.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.013
So, we wanna bring
that energy back up.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.928
I'm adding someone.

32:09.971 --> 32:13.235
She is a deck stew, but she's
coming out to help interior.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.803
This is not a person
to replace anybody,

32:15.846 --> 32:17.109
this is someone to support us.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.937
I ----ing hate this.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.079
Who's she rooming with?

32:31.123 --> 32:32.428
I think she should
go in with Mat.

32:32.472 --> 32:33.952
Dave, come in with us.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.257
Yeah, is that okay
with you guys?

32:35.301 --> 32:36.955
-Yeah.
-Thank you for that.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.392
I'm excited, because
it might be quite nice

32:39.435 --> 32:42.221
to kind of have a bit more
conversation with the lads.

32:42.264 --> 32:45.659
But at the same time, it's
three bodies in a small room.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.139
There's not a lot of space,

32:47.182 --> 32:50.142
and I try to keep things
as clean as I possibly can.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.754
It might jib on me a little bit
if it's ----ing chaos in there.

32:53.797 --> 32:59.238
Mat, I've never heard one
complaint about your food, ever.

32:59.281 --> 33:00.369
Thank you for that.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.936
You're welcome, thank you.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.026
Even though we had our
constructive criticism,

33:05.070 --> 33:06.941
it's the biggest tip
this season.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.073
Woo!

33:08.116 --> 33:12.120
So, we got $23,585,

33:12.164 --> 33:15.819
and it's $1,965 per person,

33:15.863 --> 33:17.821
1,658 euros per person.

33:17.865 --> 33:18.997
Woo!

33:19.040 --> 33:20.781
Yo, my food
was great this charter.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.870
I was the saving grace, biggest
tip of the season so far,

33:22.913 --> 33:24.350
and I hope they all
keep getting bigger.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.961
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna wash dishes.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.702
We've all got beds to make too.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.878
Katie, watch the crack.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.314
Dave, come in with us.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.099
So, I was...
yeah, I think that's the best.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.404
I think it works, Mat and her.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.797
Yeah, it makes more sense.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.320
As long as... yeah.

33:38.364 --> 33:41.019
You just have to tell her,
like, we only have a coed cabin.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.977
Yeah.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.980
Plus, there's a lot of room in
that cabin as well, with Mat.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.416
Plus, she hasn't met Mat yet,
so she'll be fine with it.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.157
Oh, Jesus.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.294
No, Katie's just
doing the pantries.

33:55.337 --> 33:58.079
Okay, I'll start in the master.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.212
What do we think about
having another stew?

34:00.255 --> 34:02.910
It could be quite interesting
to see if the dynamic changes.

34:02.953 --> 34:03.911
Thanks for being the best.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.175
Sweet, I'd better clean
up my sh--.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.829
You better.

34:08.872 --> 34:11.136
Mathew, Katie, Malia,
meet me in the crew mess

34:11.179 --> 34:13.138
for charter number five
preference sheet meeting.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.791
Roger-dodger.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.319
Oh sh--.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.407
-Ooh!
-Mm-hmm.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.408
-Oh!
-All lay-days!

34:22.451 --> 34:24.192
Ladies.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.195
Best friends Niki and Halie
are true Southern belles.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.720
Niki is a well-known realtor and
Halie owns a clothing boutique.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.896
Joining Niki and Halie are
their friends

34:32.940 --> 34:34.898
Krystal, Sarah, Ashley,

34:34.942 --> 34:36.335
Andrea, realtor,

34:36.378 --> 34:39.120
Bailey, an influencer,
and Danielle, a housewife.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.950
"Niki Wiley eats like a
five-year-old," that's so cute.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.126
She likes bacon, bacon,
and more bacon,

34:45.170 --> 34:46.954
French toast or pancakes.

34:46.997 --> 34:48.216
Sushi!

34:48.260 --> 34:50.044
Halie does not eat like
a five-year-old.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.872
Dairy allergy, don't eat corn,

34:51.915 --> 34:54.875
gluten-free or high-carb,
eat dairy-free keto.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.355
What the is that?

34:56.398 --> 35:00.359
Wow, this might be our
most dietary restrictions...

35:00.402 --> 35:02.883
not my favorite.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.537
At least one of them eats
like a five-year-old,

35:04.580 --> 35:05.538
so that will be easy.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.105
But this is ----ing intense.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.194
There's all sorts
of dietary restrictions,

35:09.237 --> 35:10.891
it's all girls.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.501
You know they're gonna
be high maintenance.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.460
All of the guests
would like a beach picnic.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.897
-Ugh.
-Lovely.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.072
Thank you, everybody.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.292
You guys enjoy your evening.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.294
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

35:27.473 --> 35:28.778
-Okay, shots?
-Yeah.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.128
Let's get it.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.434
What would you girls like?

35:32.478 --> 35:35.394
So, now you wanna be
a bartender?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.396
Lexi, less sass. Just...

35:37.439 --> 35:39.833
Okay.
Okay.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.055
I feel like once
you've had a shot,

35:45.099 --> 35:47.797
you'll be, like, less sass queen
and more yas queen.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.277
Okay, or it could
turn it up a notch.

35:49.321 --> 35:52.237
You want sassy queen
or chill queen?

35:52.280 --> 35:54.804
Sass!

36:06.990 --> 36:08.383
Are you gonna come now?

36:08.427 --> 36:10.124
Yeah, I was just gonna
stretch for a little bit.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.216
Yeah.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.131
-Hello.
-Hello.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.439
How are you feeling
on the interior?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.452
-Was that this morning?
-Yeah.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.149
That sucks, because
then it reflects on,

36:35.193 --> 36:37.586
-like, the whole team.
-Yeah.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.284
And that reflects on
Katie, when Katie's been,

36:39.327 --> 36:40.589
like, busting her ass.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.462
Hopefully good for you guys.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.290
It depends on her personality,
I think, because

36:45.333 --> 36:47.466
there's some people that can
rock in mid-charter season

36:47.509 --> 36:49.032
and, like, kill it.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.867
I haven't done much
stretching, though.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.831
I'm going straight to bed.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.491
Top of the morning to you.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.101
Top of the morning to you, bro.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.494
Hi, boys.

37:15.537 --> 37:16.669
Hey, you wanna join us?

37:16.712 --> 37:17.670
I'm bored.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.498
You hot-tubbing?

37:19.541 --> 37:21.543
I feel a bit of trauma as
Lexi's walking up the stairs.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.032
I feel like Lexi is just
sort of just a bit

37:32.075 --> 37:33.163
of a ticking time bomb,

37:33.207 --> 37:34.904
waiting for it to
happen again.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.297
I'm just watching you guys.

37:38.038 --> 37:41.041
Coming up, a sneak peek
at what's ahead this season.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.564
Yeah.

37:42.608 --> 37:45.654
His blood pressure is
really high, he has chest pains.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.221
-It was my responsibility.
-I don't trust you.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.353
I don't trust you.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.358
Hi, boys.

37:53.401 --> 37:54.533
Hey, you wanna join us?
Hot-tubbing?

37:54.576 --> 37:55.621
We're having a grand old time.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.057
Come and join us in the pool.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.928
Okay, I'm coming back, boys.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.110
Everyone's asleep,
they're boring.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.592
-Hello? <i>
-Hi. Did you ring?</i>

38:10.636 --> 38:13.987
I've been trying to call
you to say happy birthday.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.249
<i>That's all right,
love, don't worry.</i>

38:15.293 --> 38:17.425
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

38:23.475 --> 38:24.650
-Why?
-You haven't?

38:24.693 --> 38:25.694
Well, I wasn't allowed as a kid.

38:25.738 --> 38:26.695
-Oh, really?
-Oh.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.088
Okay.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.263
Yeah, my mom was
one of those moms.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.308
-Yeah.
-I'm going to ask...

38:30.351 --> 38:31.700
On what grounds is it banned?

38:31.744 --> 38:32.701
Because it's witchcraft,
so it's, like,

38:32.745 --> 38:34.747
it was against my religion.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.489
Both of my parents were
super religious, and so, like,

38:37.532 --> 38:40.970
when I got to college,
I did everything I couldn't do.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.668
There's no curfew,
you're not around to watch me.

38:42.711 --> 38:45.279
I can live with being
vilified for

38:45.323 --> 38:47.716
a little alcohol or
curse words, I'm fine with that.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.416
Okay.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.767
Oh!

38:59.162 --> 39:01.469
Yeah, it's been testing,
it's been testing.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.166
-Yeah...
-Okay, it's bedtime.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.344
Okay, I'll call you
in a few days.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.000
I had fun.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.611
I know, I...
oh, I'm chill.

39:12.654 --> 39:13.786
Am I allowed in the boys' club?

39:13.829 --> 39:15.614
-Yeah, of course.
-Okay, good.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.051
She obviously wants to try and
be more of a part of everything.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.792
I think my thing is that
I've been at a point

39:19.835 --> 39:22.229
where I felt so
----ing worthless.

39:22.272 --> 39:26.625
When I was 17 I'd just lost
two friends in a car accident,

39:26.668 --> 39:29.149
and I had, like, real
bad survivor's guilt,

39:29.192 --> 39:31.064
because I was meant
to be with them that night,

39:31.107 --> 39:33.501
and that kind of just sent me
in a bit of a plummet.

39:33.545 --> 39:36.025
But when I see
anyone that's hurting,

39:36.069 --> 39:40.465
every ounce of me wants
to be there for them,

39:40.508 --> 39:42.467
because being there
for them heals me just,

39:42.510 --> 39:44.077
like, a little bit.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.258
-Ow!

39:54.740 --> 39:56.481
Dude, how clean is it in here?

39:56.524 --> 39:59.179
I've really condensed.
She gets this whole closet.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.398
[bleep], good job.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.357
Cabin, cabin bridge,
tidy sky lounge.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.750
When this girl comes,
I might get you

40:04.793 --> 40:06.229
to spend a bit of time
with her in here...

40:06.273 --> 40:08.275
-Yeah.
-Just to show her everything.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.276
Okay, have you ever
worn a harness before?

40:09.319 --> 40:10.843
No, no.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.454
It's easiest to step into it,
hold it up to here,

40:13.498 --> 40:15.064
and then work it over the top.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.068
This is hooked onto you.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.679
-Yeah.
-This clipped to the top.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.682
But at the same time, I've been
scared of heights my whole life.

40:23.725 --> 40:24.813
And you'll get
an awkward feeling.

40:24.857 --> 40:26.206
Yeah, oh, my God.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.208
My dad taught me
to face my fears.

40:28.251 --> 40:31.516
When I was quite young, I was
scared of birds and feathers.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.518
So my dad used to make me
go to the garden

40:33.561 --> 40:35.084
and bring him back a feather,

40:35.128 --> 40:37.478
and then he'd give
me money for that.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.785
So, that taught me to
overcome the fear of birds.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.264
-Okay.
-Feel okay?

40:41.308 --> 40:42.614
Yeah.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.529
Luckily, I've come
past that now.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.401
This might have a safety lock,
so what you'll have to do is...

40:47.445 --> 40:48.402
-there you go.
-Whew!

40:48.446 --> 40:49.751
Oh!

40:55.453 --> 40:59.108
Hey, Norma, could you bring
her out of quarantine?

40:59.152 --> 41:00.588
Thank you so much.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.198
Lexi, do you wanna come
with me for a second?

41:02.242 --> 41:03.199
Yeah.

41:03.243 --> 41:04.679
You've got this.

41:04.723 --> 41:06.376
Mzi is terrified,
but I'm very proud of him.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.727
Like, I remember
my first time in a harness.

41:11.294 --> 41:12.600
Yes, Mzi!

41:14.297 --> 41:15.298
It is scary.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.605
-Are you scared?
-Yeah.

41:17.649 --> 41:18.737
It's his first time.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.565
So our last charter...

41:20.608 --> 41:22.610
I mean, you know the guests
said the comments about it.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.264
Yes.

41:24.307 --> 41:26.309
It really annoy...
it really, like...

41:26.353 --> 41:27.397
I mean, I told you it annoys me.

41:27.441 --> 41:28.573
Yeah.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.357
So, when I spoke to
you that night,

41:30.400 --> 41:33.447
for it to happen again the
following morning, you know?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.580
It's just...
to me, it seems a bit like...

41:35.623 --> 41:37.799
more like laziness
than anything.

41:37.843 --> 41:39.845
Whether it is or not, that's
just how it comes across to me.

41:39.888 --> 41:42.543
Yeah.

41:42.587 --> 41:45.111
You've been a stewardess
for how long, so it's just...

41:45.154 --> 41:47.548
-it's not acceptable.
-Yeah, definitely.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.549
And, like, I just
feel like you aren't up

41:48.593 --> 41:50.551
to a second stew standard.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.292
Things need to be done properly,

41:52.335 --> 41:54.468
and now that we do
have an extra hand...

41:54.512 --> 41:55.469
-Right.
-There is no excuse.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.862
Excuse.

41:56.905 --> 41:59.604
So, I don't wanna
have ranks anymore.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.388
Okay.

42:03.912 --> 42:09.309
And yeah, I don't know how
this is gonna go down, but...

42:09.352 --> 42:10.702
I understand.

42:13.835 --> 42:17.491
Hi!

42:17.535 --> 42:19.493
Later this season on
"Below Deck Med"...

42:19.537 --> 42:21.800
Have you been banging any
of the crew?

42:21.843 --> 42:25.325
You don't screw the crew.

42:25.368 --> 42:26.848
I mean, you could
screw the crew.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.459
Look how cool this is.

42:29.503 --> 42:31.549
Cheers.

42:31.592 --> 42:34.290
This is actually pretty
----ing amazing.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.770
Yeah.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.816
Come on, now, Katie,
we got that confidence in you.

42:37.859 --> 42:39.687
You sound like you weren't sure.

42:39.731 --> 42:43.299
----ing hell, you try
working 19-hour days.

42:43.343 --> 42:44.518
-Ooh!

42:44.562 --> 42:46.346
Holy sh--.

42:48.522 --> 42:50.829
I'm sure it begins
with an "A" or an "E."

42:50.872 --> 42:52.526
Delaney, meet me on
the bridge, please.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.659
Wow, I was so wrong on Andrea.

42:54.702 --> 42:56.225
Woo!

43:00.490 --> 43:02.797
Whatever.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.625
Lloyd?

43:04.669 --> 43:05.974
You dropped so quickly
I couldn't read it from there.

43:06.018 --> 43:07.367
I really need you to pick up
your game, okay?

43:07.410 --> 43:10.631
Yeah.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.199
His blood pressure's really
high, he has chest pains.

43:13.242 --> 43:14.374
We've come this far
with the three of us,

43:14.417 --> 43:15.941
we can finish it
the three of us.

43:15.984 --> 43:18.944
Woman up, make a decision,
and go have a conversation.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.685
Do I wanna spend
an extra five minutes

43:20.728 --> 43:22.512
and the fish getting cold
and overcooked?

43:22.556 --> 43:23.818
I'm not that guy.

43:23.862 --> 43:26.604
I'm, um, backup chef
for you guys.

43:26.647 --> 43:27.866
Oh, okay.

43:27.909 --> 43:29.345
Throwing stern lines.

43:29.389 --> 43:31.565
[bleep]'s sake.

43:34.046 --> 43:35.830
I don't...
I don't trust you.

43:35.874 --> 43:36.831
-It was my responsibility.
-I don't trust you.

43:36.875 --> 43:38.485
No one here likes you.

43:38.528 --> 43:39.573
You're a dick,
you're ugly as

43:39.617 --> 43:41.401
Oh!

43:41.444 --> 43:42.532
If this wasn't on camera,
I would have smacked your ass.

43:43.969 --> 43:45.405
Dave!

43:45.448 --> 43:46.711
He needs to see a doctor.

43:46.754 --> 43:47.668
Oh.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.670
Burned my finger pretty bad.

43:49.714 --> 43:51.411
Holy God!
