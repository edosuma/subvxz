01:04.673 --> 01:07.209
I don't know, George.

01:07.309 --> 01:10.321
Is it too windy for flying a kite?

01:11.113 --> 01:13.674
Thinking that's a yes.

01:14.427 --> 01:15.978
George?

01:18.986 --> 01:20.521
George!

01:26.227 --> 01:27.129
Hi.

01:30.198 --> 01:34.101
You're right, George. It's awesome.

01:38.373 --> 01:40.241
You want to fly it yourself?

01:42.811 --> 01:48.149
And regretting this in three, two, one.

01:50.518 --> 01:52.254
George!

01:53.770 --> 01:54.723
Hey.

01:56.490 --> 01:57.559
Hi.

02:00.462 --> 02:03.632
<i>You feel safe with your feet
on the ground</i>

02:03.732 --> 02:08.303
- <i>Where everything's predictable</i>
- George, come down from there!

02:08.402 --> 02:13.675
<i>So many possibilities passing you by</i>

02:16.411 --> 02:19.047
<i>Well, drop your things
And look up to the sky</i>

02:19.147 --> 02:22.817
Sorry about that.
My monkey got carried away.

02:23.418 --> 02:26.296
- <i>'Cause when you're up for anything</i>
- George!

02:26.396 --> 02:27.922
- That's not safe!
- <i>You reach higher</i>

02:28.022 --> 02:31.660
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

02:31.760 --> 02:34.442
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

02:34.542 --> 02:37.832
- <i>You live open and free</i>
- Sorry about that.

02:37.932 --> 02:40.569
<i>So come on, come on with me</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:51.580
- <i>I guess you never heard it before</i>
- Hi.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.318
- George!
- <i>But nothing is impossible</i>

02:56.418 --> 03:01.859
<i>Sometimes you got to give it another try</i>

03:04.459 --> 03:09.497
<i>But dig deep and put your fears aside</i>

03:11.433 --> 03:15.083
<i>'Cause when you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

03:15.183 --> 03:19.576
- Begging your pardon. Have a nice day!
- <i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

03:19.676 --> 03:22.444
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

03:22.544 --> 03:25.881
<i>You live open and free</i>

03:25.981 --> 03:31.018
<i>So come on, come on with me, yeah</i>

03:32.654 --> 03:36.141
<i>You can wait for life to bring you</i>

03:36.241 --> 03:38.386
- <i>All your hopes and dreams</i>
- Bye.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.578
- <i>Wrapped in a bow</i>
- Yikes!

03:41.228 --> 03:45.545
<i>I won't tell you what to do</i>

03:45.988 --> 03:47.769
<i>No</i>

03:48.938 --> 03:51.873
- <i>But happiness is out there</i>
- My bad.

03:51.973 --> 03:56.644
<i>And how much you can grab is up to you</i>

03:58.715 --> 04:01.215
<i>It's up to you</i>

04:01.315 --> 04:03.518
George, the park is no place
to fly a kite.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.922
<i>'Cause when you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

04:08.022 --> 04:11.693
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:14.429
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

04:14.529 --> 04:17.865
<i>You live open and free</i>

04:17.964 --> 04:19.733
<i>So come on, come on</i>

04:19.834 --> 04:23.838
<i>When you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

04:23.938 --> 04:27.594
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

04:27.694 --> 04:32.580
<i>When you're up for anything
you live open and free...</i>

04:32.680 --> 04:34.522
Okay, now you gotta go
a little to the left.

04:35.617 --> 04:37.152
Now to the right. No!

04:44.426 --> 04:49.096
George, that was very, very, very...

04:51.098 --> 04:52.934
not good.

04:54.135 --> 04:56.805
When will you learn caution, George?

04:56.905 --> 04:59.774
Forget about "no"
and "yes" and "banana."

04:59.874 --> 05:02.510
You need to learn the word "caution."

05:02.610 --> 05:05.680
How about the word "lawsuit?"

05:07.882 --> 05:11.019
I'm so sorry.
Here's my contact information.

05:11.119 --> 05:14.755
My insurance company
and dry cleaner are on the back. I...

05:17.041 --> 05:21.246
There you go. Yes, one for you, too.
It'll come out. I promise.

05:21.496 --> 05:23.498
Come along, George.

05:24.265 --> 05:26.301
Bye!

05:38.946 --> 05:44.018
Okay, George. I need you
to wait here while I get cleaned up.

05:45.119 --> 05:46.588
And please...

05:47.922 --> 05:50.157
no more surprises.

05:54.195 --> 05:57.165
The time for adventure is over.

06:19.954 --> 06:21.789
George?

06:22.490 --> 06:24.492
I'll be right there.

06:34.135 --> 06:35.670
Hi.

06:39.257 --> 06:41.059
George?

06:41.159 --> 06:43.144
Come down from there.

06:43.244 --> 06:45.547
But he's havin' so much fun.

06:45.647 --> 06:48.149
Yes, but he shouldn't be...

06:48.655 --> 06:49.951
Who are you?

06:50.151 --> 06:53.154
I've come to see a man about a monkey.

06:53.254 --> 06:55.623
Let me guess. Yellow hat,

06:55.723 --> 06:58.721
yellow suit, look of deep distress.

06:58.821 --> 07:02.714
You must be Ted,
which means that must be...

07:02.814 --> 07:03.982
Hello.

07:04.332 --> 07:07.068
Hello, George.
It's an honor to meet you.

07:09.203 --> 07:12.740
Hal Houston from GSA,
the Global Space Agency.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.810
And this is my tactical assistant,
Andrew.

07:16.277 --> 07:19.047
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi.

07:19.347 --> 07:22.184
We've had our eye on George
for some time.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.323
- Look, if we owe you for any damage...
- Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.

07:29.423 --> 07:33.695
We want George
for a very important mission.

07:39.601 --> 07:42.003
A space mission.

07:43.805 --> 07:46.540
Yes, you! Hop aboard.

07:53.281 --> 07:56.751
Did you know the first astronauts
were monkeys?

07:57.251 --> 08:00.688
They went boldly
where no man has gone before.

08:01.623 --> 08:03.658
They were heroes.

08:04.058 --> 08:06.895
How would you like to be one of them?

08:09.130 --> 08:11.999
So, what is this mission?

08:12.099 --> 08:15.269
I'm glad you asked. Andrew?

08:23.177 --> 08:28.182
Welcome to majestic Central Africa.

08:31.285 --> 08:32.554
Oops.

08:35.222 --> 08:39.592
As I was saying,
majestic Central Africa!

08:40.761 --> 08:43.496
This is where you came from, George.

08:48.436 --> 08:52.240
Lately it's been getting a lot of rain,
causing rivers to overflow.

08:52.340 --> 08:55.277
And do you know what that means? Andrew.

08:58.946 --> 09:00.849
That's right, flooding.

09:07.925 --> 09:12.126
To help control the flooding, we created
a device about as big as your hand,

09:12.226 --> 09:17.131
which we call the Regional
Dam Synchronizer. RDS.

09:17.231 --> 09:19.408
<i>We put it in our satellite,</i>

09:19.508 --> 09:21.711
<i>and with the satellite...</i>

09:22.603 --> 09:25.673
<i>we can control
the distribution of water.</i>

09:27.675 --> 09:30.612
<i>We call it Project Stop Flooding.</i>

09:33.314 --> 09:36.851
The problem is...
and this is the embarrassing part.

09:36.951 --> 09:41.789
<i>Our satellite containing the RDS
has failed and can't be fixed.</i>

09:41.956 --> 09:44.926
And without it... Andrew.

09:45.192 --> 09:46.928
Oh, boy.

09:48.396 --> 09:49.931
More flooding.

09:55.436 --> 10:00.575
Yes, George. The flooding is very bad
for the animals and the land.

10:00.675 --> 10:04.278
That's why we need a brave monkey
to go up in space

10:04.378 --> 10:08.682
and get that RDS,
so we can install it...

10:09.350 --> 10:13.287
Here in our new Ground
Communications Tower in Africa.

10:13.387 --> 10:15.424
Right on the Louis Leakey Dam.

10:16.224 --> 10:20.662
We're not taking a chance on putting it
directly in a space satellite again.

10:21.162 --> 10:25.266
Why can't you just put another RDS
in that tower and not go to space?

10:25.366 --> 10:29.471
It's custom-built! It would take
forever to create a new one.

10:29.871 --> 10:32.841
So what do you say, George?
Can we count on ya?

10:35.543 --> 10:37.708
No! No! I mean...

10:37.808 --> 10:42.817
No kidding, that's a valuable mission,
but why not send a human?

10:42.917 --> 10:46.120
The human-size rockets
have all been moved to museums.

10:46.220 --> 10:51.025
But I tracked down a monkey capsule
in mint condition.

10:56.147 --> 10:58.883
Thanks for the offer, Mr. Houston,

10:58.983 --> 11:01.119
but I don't think it's a good idea.

11:06.941 --> 11:08.643
I'm sorry, George.

11:09.143 --> 11:12.013
Not everyone loves adventure like we do.

11:13.114 --> 11:14.382
Let's go, Andrew.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.132
Hey. Wait.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.135
I didn't say no, exactly.

11:36.137 --> 11:38.112
Are you sure this is safe?

11:38.572 --> 11:43.944
Why, it's as safe as flying a kite!

11:49.817 --> 11:51.485
Okay, George.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.923
But only if you complete
the training without a hitch.

11:59.226 --> 12:01.963
Let's get you in training!

12:08.836 --> 12:10.796
<i>Let's go</i>

12:12.339 --> 12:14.293
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

12:16.610 --> 12:19.914
<i>Well, let's say
you're caught up in a bind</i>

12:20.014 --> 12:23.340
<i>Well, I've got the perfect guy in mind</i>

12:23.440 --> 12:25.954
<i>He sees things a different way</i>

12:26.222 --> 12:30.458
<i>A stumble here and there,
but things are okay</i>

12:30.558 --> 12:33.694
<i>At first glance
you just might have your doubts</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:37.175
<i>But this guy he always works it out</i>

12:37.275 --> 12:39.801
<i>Stays tough and saves the day</i>

12:39.901 --> 12:44.221
<i>'Cause giving up ain't in his DNA</i>

12:44.321 --> 12:46.574
<i>Yeah, he might be a little strange</i>

12:46.674 --> 12:49.911
<i>But he'll help you, yes, he can</i>

12:50.011 --> 12:53.915
<i>Yeah, he's only just
your ordinary superman</i>

12:54.015 --> 12:58.519
- <i>He can help you, yes he can</i>
- <i>Yes, he can</i>

12:58.619 --> 13:01.122
<i>He's your ordinary superman</i>

13:01.222 --> 13:04.692
<i>He's so cool you wanna be like him</i>

13:04.792 --> 13:08.096
<i>Nonstop and never givin' in</i>

13:08.196 --> 13:10.698
<i>Head first and steely-eyed</i>

13:10.798 --> 13:14.802
<i>When things are down
he's always lookin' upside</i>

13:14.902 --> 13:18.222
<i>He might take a different route than you</i>

13:18.322 --> 13:21.842
<i>But he's got a different point of view</i>

13:21.942 --> 13:24.445
<i>Leaves most folks scratchin' their heads</i>

13:24.545 --> 13:28.666
<i>If only they would listen to what I said</i>

13:28.766 --> 13:31.102
<i>That he might be a little strange</i>

13:31.202 --> 13:33.988
<i>But he'll help you, yes, he can</i>

13:34.588 --> 13:38.492
<i>Yeah, he's only just
your ordinary superman</i>

13:38.592 --> 13:41.095
<i>He can help you, yes, he can</i>

13:41.195 --> 13:45.333
<i>Yes, he can, he's your ordinary superman</i>

13:45.433 --> 13:49.204
- <i>He can help you, yes, he can</i>
- <i>Baby, yes, he can</i>

13:50.037 --> 13:53.007
<i>He's your ordinary superman</i>

13:53.407 --> 13:56.977
- Yeah! Yeah!
- <i>He's just a superman...</i>

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
George!

14:05.953 --> 14:10.758
George, I now certify you space-ready.

14:14.995 --> 14:17.264
What do you say, Ted?

14:20.768 --> 14:22.703
I say...

14:25.439 --> 14:27.575
Congratulations, George.

14:28.275 --> 14:31.078
You've got the right stuff.

14:59.306 --> 15:03.277
I'm gonna miss you, George.
Be careful up there.

15:07.581 --> 15:09.917
I can't go with you, George,

15:10.017 --> 15:13.086
but I brought you something
to keep you company.

15:24.431 --> 15:26.700
I love you, too.

15:27.835 --> 15:30.815
And I'll be right here waiting for you.

15:31.605 --> 15:35.175
Good luck on your mission,
Space Monkey George.

16:02.035 --> 16:05.038
Relax, Ted. Everything's gonna be fine.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.640
Are you sure?

16:07.140 --> 16:08.309
Yes!

16:08.409 --> 16:13.047
I personally reviewed and accounted for
all aspects of this mission.

16:13.147 --> 16:15.649
Trust me, nothing will go wrong.

16:16.050 --> 16:19.253
Andrew, let's get the party started.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.557
Space Monkey George,
are you ready for launch?

16:24.992 --> 16:26.961
<i>T minus five...</i>

16:27.061 --> 16:31.132
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

16:33.367 --> 16:34.802
<i>Liftoff!</i>

17:14.974 --> 17:18.579
<i>The capsule will auto dock
with the satellite in five...</i>

17:19.377 --> 17:21.749
<i>four... three...</i>

17:22.449 --> 17:24.585
two... one.

17:24.785 --> 17:27.721
<i>Capsule has successfully
docked with the satellite.</i>

17:27.820 --> 17:29.690
Yeah!

17:31.492 --> 17:33.961
Space Monkey George, proceed.

17:36.563 --> 17:37.932
Good luck, George.

17:56.850 --> 18:00.688
Okay, George.
Now just the way you practiced.

18:16.414 --> 18:19.240
- Yeah!
- He has the RDS in his possession!

18:23.777 --> 18:25.346
Hug it up, Teddy boy!

18:29.016 --> 18:30.951
People...

18:33.753 --> 18:35.456
Andrew, do something!

18:36.290 --> 18:37.875
George, the RDS!

18:37.975 --> 18:40.974
<i>You've lost the RDS!</i>

18:46.450 --> 18:48.079
Go get it, George!

18:53.590 --> 18:55.659
He did it!

18:56.977 --> 18:58.779
That's my George.

19:15.496 --> 19:19.500
Nice work, Space Monkey George.
We're bringing you home.

19:22.503 --> 19:24.871
Activating capsule return.

19:36.783 --> 19:38.786
And that's lunch.

19:42.589 --> 19:46.093
We're celebrating. Come on, George.
You can join us.

19:48.095 --> 19:51.631
We call it celestial slime.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.617
Astronauts love it.

19:56.503 --> 19:59.873
Or you can check the bag
I hid behind your seat.

20:05.422 --> 20:09.650
Peanut butter and banana, his favorite.
I hope you don't mind.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.754
No problem. It's my favorite, too.

20:13.854 --> 20:17.090
<i>Take five, George. You deserve it.</i>

20:44.701 --> 20:46.954
Should George be doing that?

20:47.054 --> 20:50.424
Ted, stop worrying and relax.

20:50.524 --> 20:54.261
The mission's accomplished.
What could happen now?

21:01.113 --> 21:02.903
I've lost control.

21:03.003 --> 21:05.832
- Houston, we have a problem!
- What?

21:09.843 --> 21:12.045
<i>Capsule is in freefall.</i>

21:12.145 --> 21:14.948
Freefall? That's not good! Right?

21:15.048 --> 21:17.385
Technically, that's not good.

21:25.192 --> 21:26.527
Yahoo!

21:34.134 --> 21:35.769
Save my monkey!

21:35.869 --> 21:38.572
Eject, George! Hit the red button!

21:48.381 --> 21:50.984
George? The red button!

21:51.084 --> 21:54.254
<i>Eject! Hit the red button!</i>

21:59.192 --> 22:02.229
<i>Emergency ejection enabled.</i>

22:02.973 --> 22:04.157
<i>Ejection.</i>

22:25.669 --> 22:28.722
- He ejected!
- That's great! Now what?

22:28.822 --> 22:30.124
Now we go get him.

22:35.262 --> 22:36.630
Where are we going?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.234
Central Africa.

22:40.434 --> 22:44.421
Of course! Don't worry, Ted.
I'll find our monkey.

22:44.521 --> 22:47.558
I'm not worried. I'm coming with you.

22:49.109 --> 22:51.111
Hello?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.116
Hello?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.530
So what's the plan?

23:43.630 --> 23:47.167
Let's take a look
at the surrounding area. Andrew.

23:48.201 --> 23:53.307
- Welcome to majestic Central...
- Let's not. Where's George?

23:53.907 --> 23:57.010
Last report had George
over the Lotta Watta Falls.

23:57.110 --> 24:00.414
We're pretty sure
he's within a 500-mile radius.

24:00.714 --> 24:03.951
- 500-mile radius?
- You mean circumference.

24:04.051 --> 24:07.337
I'm pretty sure it's radius.
Circumference goes around the circle.

24:07.437 --> 24:08.739
- Definitely circumference.
- Hold on.

24:08.839 --> 24:11.625
Five hundred miles of anything
is really big.

24:11.725 --> 24:14.061
Have you ever found an astronaut before?

24:14.161 --> 24:18.532
We've never lost one before.
But we have five teams out looking.

24:18.632 --> 24:20.922
Now you've got six.

24:21.022 --> 24:21.969
Ted?

24:22.669 --> 24:26.440
- Where are you going?
- To find my monkey.

24:27.908 --> 24:29.810
Circumference?

24:29.910 --> 24:31.745
Radius.

24:41.588 --> 24:42.599
Yeah.

24:45.158 --> 24:47.761
Excuse me. I need a pilot and a plane.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.197
No tours today. Pilot out sick.

24:52.232 --> 24:54.268
There must be someone who can fly.

24:54.768 --> 24:59.039
Listen, friend. I told you.
We don't have any pilots available. Hey.

25:02.242 --> 25:04.211
Global Space Agency?

25:04.811 --> 25:06.813
Are you an astronaut?

25:06.913 --> 25:10.300
Oh, that. It's a long story.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.737
You guys know more
about piloting than anyone.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.072
You can take the plane yourself.

25:16.172 --> 25:19.159
- No, you don't understand.
- And if you want to get into the air today,

25:19.259 --> 25:21.694
you'll need to fly it.

25:25.866 --> 25:29.169
Flying an airplane...
how hard can it be?

25:31.238 --> 25:35.175
It's like a car, except you drive
in the air where you can fall and...

25:37.314 --> 25:39.846
What am I thinking? I can't do this!

25:44.451 --> 25:46.653
That wasn't so hard.

25:57.297 --> 25:59.344
I'm in the air.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.769
And I'm heading for a tree!

26:56.690 --> 26:59.225
Trees all look alike.

26:59.325 --> 27:01.528
Except for that one
with the parachute on it.

27:01.628 --> 27:04.014
Parachute? Yes!

27:09.136 --> 27:13.473
"Reduce throttle.
Gently touch the water."

27:14.107 --> 27:15.942
Simple.

27:26.252 --> 27:27.938
Oh, no.

27:28.038 --> 27:29.600
Look out!

27:40.901 --> 27:43.904
Come in, Mr. Plane Rental Man.

27:44.004 --> 27:47.741
I have the funniest story to tell ya.

27:48.274 --> 27:50.610
Or not.

27:52.378 --> 27:54.230
Okay.

27:54.630 --> 27:56.649
Got map.

27:57.751 --> 28:01.287
And subway tokens.

28:01.954 --> 28:03.523
All right.

28:03.623 --> 28:07.193
Everything's under control. Here I go.

28:11.798 --> 28:16.984
I've got to find George.
The jungle is no place for a monkey.

28:26.980 --> 28:31.033
<i>Everything's so different
How'd you end up here</i>

28:31.884 --> 28:35.822
<i>Reach out and grab it
Let your worries disappear</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:39.609
<i>'Cause it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity</i>

28:39.709 --> 28:41.978
<i>Is waitin' straight ahead</i>

28:43.163 --> 28:45.337
<i>That's what I said</i>

28:45.682 --> 28:50.971
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

28:51.638 --> 28:55.476
<i>Roll with the changes
Take a few chances now and then</i>

28:56.609 --> 28:58.278
<i>Make every moment count</i>

28:58.378 --> 29:02.982
<i>And you just might have
the time of your life</i>

29:04.050 --> 29:07.620
<i>Welcome to paradise</i>

29:11.458 --> 29:15.662
<i>Hey, you, you're missing out
on all the fun</i>

29:16.389 --> 29:20.200
<i>Just take it easy
seems you're always on the run</i>

29:20.300 --> 29:21.287
<i>Slow it down</i>

29:21.387 --> 29:27.040
<i>Take in the scenery
and give into the magic of the day</i>

29:27.707 --> 29:29.942
<i>That's what I say</i>

29:31.277 --> 29:36.049
<i>Woke up to sunshine
Now it's pouring rain</i>

29:36.149 --> 29:39.953
<i>No guarantees, enjoy it all the same</i>

29:40.053 --> 29:42.505
<i>I'm telling you,
it's all how you take it</i>

29:42.605 --> 29:47.108
<i>Grab those lemons
and you make some lemonade</i>

29:47.460 --> 29:49.545
<i>You got it made</i>

29:49.829 --> 29:55.719
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

29:55.819 --> 30:00.006
<i>Roll with the changes
Take a few chances now and then</i>

30:00.954 --> 30:02.608
<i>Make every moment count</i>

30:02.708 --> 30:07.112
<i>And you just might have
the time of your life</i>

30:08.348 --> 30:10.932
<i>Welcome to paradise</i>

30:15.922 --> 30:18.825
<i>Everything's so different</i>

30:18.925 --> 30:22.428
<i>It's all so strange</i>

30:25.765 --> 30:28.636
<i>Reach out and grab it</i>

30:28.736 --> 30:32.005
<i>Roll with the change</i>

30:32.105 --> 30:37.277
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

30:38.044 --> 30:42.482
<i>Roll with the changes
Take a few chances now and then</i>

30:42.984 --> 30:44.662
<i>Make every moment count</i>

30:44.762 --> 30:49.522
<i>And you just might have
the time of your life</i>

30:50.456 --> 30:54.193
<i>Welcome to paradise</i>

30:55.962 --> 30:58.532
<i>To paradise</i>

31:01.103 --> 31:05.211
<i>To paradise</i>

31:27.227 --> 31:31.431
Goodnight, George, wherever you are.

31:43.176 --> 31:46.146
Team 5. Come in, Team 5.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.814
- Sir.
- Not now, Andrew.

31:47.914 --> 31:49.516
I'm trying to contact Team 5.

31:50.350 --> 31:53.219
You're speaking into your hot dog.

31:53.853 --> 31:55.889
They're very good, by the way.

31:57.690 --> 31:59.359
Team 5, anything yet?

31:59.859 --> 32:02.829
<i>No sign of the monkey or the capsule.</i>

32:03.329 --> 32:06.266
I'm tired of waiting around, Andrew.
There's an old saying...

32:06.366 --> 32:09.936
"If you want something done right,
do it yourself."

32:11.537 --> 32:15.909
This is Search Command One.
We're heading out.

32:16.009 --> 32:17.910
Hot dog.

32:40.733 --> 32:43.302
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.190
I can't take this!

34:11.291 --> 34:15.661
I just want my monkey so I can go home!

34:19.899 --> 34:20.867
George?

34:23.603 --> 34:26.572
Thank goodness I've found you!

34:26.873 --> 34:30.783
I was so worried about you.

34:31.311 --> 34:35.047
That is the last time you go into
outer space and crash-land on Earth,

34:35.147 --> 34:36.949
you hear me?

34:38.685 --> 34:41.655
I missed you so much, George.

34:43.856 --> 34:46.659
Now, let's go home.

35:20.626 --> 35:22.795
You know the problem with maps?

35:22.895 --> 35:25.631
They only work if you know
where you are.

35:25.731 --> 35:28.668
They should invent a map to help you know
where you are on the map.

35:28.768 --> 35:34.110
Okay, I'm thinking the river is here.
What do you think, George?

35:39.745 --> 35:41.047
George?

35:44.250 --> 35:48.815
We're lost in Central Africa.
We need to work on getting home.

35:56.062 --> 35:57.964
Ta-da!

35:59.432 --> 36:01.668
Things around here
could be dangerous, George.

36:01.768 --> 36:03.670
You need to exercise a little caution.

36:06.672 --> 36:10.076
What I mean is that you need
to be more careful.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.713
You're a curious little monkey,
and I know you like to play,

36:20.813 --> 36:24.857
but from now on
I want you to stick by me, okay?

36:26.659 --> 36:28.361
George?

36:29.128 --> 36:30.963
George!

36:31.664 --> 36:33.066
George!

36:39.872 --> 36:42.658
George? What did I say about caution?

36:42.758 --> 36:45.094
Those are wild elephants.

36:47.863 --> 36:49.782
I'm sure they are nice,

36:49.882 --> 36:52.819
but so's a city bus
until it runs over you.

36:54.887 --> 36:57.940
This is my serious voice now...

36:58.040 --> 37:00.993
I want you to come down this minute.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.830
I am not getting
on that big smelly thing!

37:14.707 --> 37:16.555
Bye.

37:17.510 --> 37:21.514
Now I want you to promise me, George,
no more adventures.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.549
You got it?

37:25.685 --> 37:30.756
You can't just go around wherever you like
in a jungle. You need to watch yourself.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.930
Now I'm pretty sure if we go
this way, we'll reach the river.

37:38.030 --> 37:40.733
And when we get to a village,
they'll call Mr. Houston for us.

37:40.833 --> 37:44.770
We'll be home before you can say
"banana." Right, George?

37:44.870 --> 37:46.772
George?

37:48.574 --> 37:52.145
Oh, no. Remember? Caution?

37:59.952 --> 38:02.188
George! Where are you?

38:14.834 --> 38:19.605
What did I just say?
No! No, no! Bad George!

38:21.641 --> 38:23.643
Now, let's go.

38:27.146 --> 38:29.932
You need to learn that I'm the grown-up
and you're the monkey.

38:30.032 --> 38:34.987
Monkeys do what grown-ups say.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.

38:35.455 --> 38:38.491
No more Mr. Nice Man
With The Yellow Hat.

38:38.591 --> 38:41.160
I'm putting my foot down!

38:49.502 --> 38:51.570
Oh, boy.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.514
What's all that growling?

39:01.947 --> 39:05.752
Help! Please! Get me down.
That gorilla wants to eat me for dinner!

39:08.421 --> 39:12.158
Don't be a worrywart. He's a vegetarian.

39:12.258 --> 39:16.229
Well, except for a bug or two.
Right, Seymour?

39:16.962 --> 39:20.700
- You... You know him?
- I rescued him.

39:20.800 --> 39:26.138
I run this animal preserve.
Kulinda, Naja P. Doctor.

39:26.238 --> 39:29.427
He helps me catch poachers like you.

39:29.809 --> 39:34.314
Animal preserve? Poachers?
No, this is a terrible mistake.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.083
I'm not a poacher.
I'm a museum director.

39:37.383 --> 39:40.086
Right. And that's your city monkey?

39:40.820 --> 39:44.656
It's true! Tell her, George.

39:49.161 --> 39:52.114
This... this is just
a big misunderstanding.

39:52.214 --> 39:54.650
It's really quite funny.

39:55.668 --> 39:58.036
Come on, little fellow.

39:59.338 --> 40:01.507
Let's get you home.

40:02.241 --> 40:04.276
You like the hat?

40:06.312 --> 40:09.381
Seymour, bring him.

40:14.687 --> 40:18.924
Tree branch ahead. I wonder
if you could watch the head.

40:19.024 --> 40:20.860
Okay, we'll work on that.

40:40.139 --> 40:44.150
Have some fruit, little monkey.
I'll be down in a minute.

41:03.349 --> 41:04.330
George.

41:10.643 --> 41:13.713
George, I shouldn't have blown my top.

41:13.813 --> 41:16.916
I guess even big people
can be wrong sometimes.

41:21.754 --> 41:23.989
You know what I was really wrong about?

41:24.089 --> 41:26.225
You're not bad, George.

41:26.325 --> 41:28.962
You're the best George
in the whole world.

41:31.997 --> 41:34.967
I'm so sorry.

41:35.434 --> 41:36.736
Forgive me?

41:43.842 --> 41:45.278
Buddy.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.919
What's gotten into you two?

41:56.889 --> 41:59.291
Come here, little monkey.

42:02.494 --> 42:03.929
Look, Dr. Kulinda...

42:04.029 --> 42:07.533
Don't try to form a bond with me
by using my name.

42:07.633 --> 42:09.506
Call me...

42:09.935 --> 42:15.240
Dr. African Scientist Worker Lady.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.977
Okay, Dr. Worker...

42:18.327 --> 42:20.763
African Scientist.

42:23.282 --> 42:26.919
African Scientist Doctor Lady.

42:27.019 --> 42:30.423
This can all be cleared up.
I just need one phone call.

42:31.392 --> 42:35.295
Gonna lawyer up? Well, forget it, pal.
The phones are out.

43:01.687 --> 43:04.356
I see you've met Strich.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.536
She likes bananas.

43:07.636 --> 43:11.497
Is there any way of communicating
with the outside world?

43:11.597 --> 43:15.117
'Fraid not. Unless you poached
some pigeons, too.

43:15.217 --> 43:19.672
All the phones went out the day they shot up
that rocket for the Project Stop Flooding.

43:21.057 --> 43:25.477
Hey. You know about that?
That was George's mission.

43:26.912 --> 43:28.814
Wait a minute.

43:28.914 --> 43:32.151
You're the monkey astronaut
we've been hearing about?

43:38.290 --> 43:40.593
That's right. And I'm with George.

43:41.193 --> 43:44.018
I did hear that astronaut was friends

43:44.118 --> 43:47.912
with some big city bozo
with a yellow hat.

43:50.586 --> 43:51.654
That's me!

43:53.789 --> 43:55.441
I should have figured it out.

43:55.541 --> 43:58.778
How many ridiculous hats like yours
are there in the world?

43:58.878 --> 44:01.764
I know, exactly! What?

44:01.864 --> 44:06.151
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Seymour, untie him.

44:08.620 --> 44:12.725
No! Okay, Seymour, remember that...
Watch the head thing!

44:14.994 --> 44:17.396
Okay. Gettin' a little better.

44:20.466 --> 44:22.735
Anything, Andrew?

44:23.502 --> 44:25.187
Not yet, sir.

44:25.287 --> 44:28.141
The map shows Kulinda
Animal Preserve is within range.

44:29.241 --> 44:31.344
Maybe it's worth a flyover.

44:31.744 --> 44:35.881
I think it's highly unlikely that George
would have gotten that far.

44:35.981 --> 44:40.386
Well, it's just...
Well, you never know and...

44:40.486 --> 44:45.758
Well, I've heard Doctor Kulinda's
tree house is so cool and awesome.

44:45.858 --> 44:49.261
Well, if George made it to this area,
I'd bet he'd go there.

44:49.561 --> 44:51.997
All right, fan-boy.
We'll give it a flyby.

44:52.864 --> 44:54.633
Yes!

45:03.642 --> 45:05.711
Sorry about the mix-up, Ted.

45:05.911 --> 45:08.981
We appreciate what you are trying to do.

45:09.081 --> 45:12.885
The river flooding
seems worse each year.

45:16.889 --> 45:20.358
Hey, buddy. You did your best.

45:21.010 --> 45:24.330
Dr. Lady Scientist?

45:24.430 --> 45:27.666
Now that I know you're not
completely despicable,

45:27.766 --> 45:30.469
you can call me Naja.

45:31.236 --> 45:32.272
Okay.

45:33.372 --> 45:37.810
Naja. So, there's nothing we can do
to fix the communications?

45:37.910 --> 45:38.978
Nothing.

45:46.552 --> 45:49.287
What? What is it, George?

45:50.956 --> 45:53.092
I do hear something.

45:53.192 --> 45:55.894
Like a helicopter?

46:08.808 --> 46:12.244
<i>Mr. Houston, come in.
Come in, Mister Houston.</i>

46:12.344 --> 46:15.280
<i>We've had a sighting
of a monkey in a spacesuit.</i>

46:15.380 --> 46:16.383
Where is he?

46:16.483 --> 46:19.318
<i>A small village 30 miles east
of the Big River.</i>

46:19.418 --> 46:21.286
I'm on my way!

46:21.386 --> 46:25.358
What did I tell ya, Andrew?
I knew I'd find our monkey.

46:25.858 --> 46:28.093
Good job, sir.

46:35.134 --> 46:36.902
It's turned around.

46:37.002 --> 46:39.538
Wait! Wait!

46:40.339 --> 46:43.075
It's gone.

46:49.314 --> 46:51.316
We're stranded.

46:51.583 --> 46:55.254
I want to go home to my city,
where it's nice and safe,

46:55.354 --> 46:58.824
and my dry cleaner
expects me every Monday.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.561
Get your hat on.

47:05.064 --> 47:08.634
Before you get all misty-eye
about your dry cleaned life,

47:08.734 --> 47:11.337
you should see something first.

47:23.782 --> 47:27.419
Looks like you made
a new friend, George.

47:30.923 --> 47:34.700
<i>There's a place where the air is clean</i>

47:35.260 --> 47:40.883
<i>The trees are towering,
the grass is green</i>

47:40.983 --> 47:45.270
<i>And the sun smiles down</i>

47:49.341 --> 47:53.679
<i>Feel the power and embrace the call</i>

47:53.779 --> 47:58.484
<i>Take it in before it's all gone</i>

47:59.251 --> 48:01.453
- <i>Here's your chance</i>
- Hi.

48:01.553 --> 48:03.956
<i>Grab it now</i>

48:06.091 --> 48:08.911
<i>And the dreams you long for</i>

48:09.011 --> 48:12.869
<i>Can all be found right here</i>

48:15.234 --> 48:19.822
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

48:20.022 --> 48:24.443
<i>So full of strength and majesty</i>

48:24.543 --> 48:28.280
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

48:29.281 --> 48:32.017
<i>Lift up your heart</i>

48:32.117 --> 48:36.254
<i>Open your eyes and see</i>

48:44.096 --> 48:47.398
<i>Every inch out here is so alive</i>

48:48.634 --> 48:54.006
<i>Where the hidden and the strong survive</i>

48:54.106 --> 48:58.810
<i>It's the way it's always been</i>

49:00.946 --> 49:02.347
<i>Yeah</i>

49:02.447 --> 49:06.818
<i>New experiences everywhere</i>

49:06.918 --> 49:12.324
<i>Just look closer, can you see it there?</i>

49:12.424 --> 49:17.395
<i>The surprises never end</i>

49:19.131 --> 49:21.433
<i>And the more you see</i>

49:21.533 --> 49:27.206
<i>The more you're left in awe</i>

49:27.306 --> 49:28.346
<i>Yeah!</i>

49:28.446 --> 49:33.045
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

49:33.145 --> 49:35.948
<i>Lift up your heart</i>

49:36.048 --> 49:41.086
<i>Open your eyes and see</i>

49:42.387 --> 49:44.756
This does kind of grow on you.

49:44.856 --> 49:46.659
- Ya think?
- Yeah.

49:47.559 --> 49:50.495
That was fun. Kind of...

49:52.531 --> 49:55.834
Exciting, yeah. Yes, I guess so.

50:01.040 --> 50:05.277
Well, that explains why
our communications are out.

50:05.377 --> 50:08.180
The antenna on the dam
has been knocked down.

50:10.515 --> 50:15.020
But they'll fix it soon.
Can't live without our cell phones.

50:18.657 --> 50:20.876
I wonder how that could have happened.

50:21.526 --> 50:25.197
Hey, is there any chance that's the tower
where the RDS is supposed to go?

50:26.865 --> 50:28.334
It sure is.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.286
What is it, George?

50:51.757 --> 50:55.426
- The space capsule!
- Let me see.

50:57.896 --> 51:00.265
Oh, not good.

51:00.365 --> 51:03.352
It's across the Forsaken Ravine.

51:07.772 --> 51:11.276
You think the RDS
is still on board the capsule?

51:14.813 --> 51:17.031
You want us to go get it?

51:19.818 --> 51:23.555
I don't know, George.
You heard what Dr. Kulinda said earlier.

51:23.655 --> 51:28.093
She used words like "ravine"
and "forsaken."

51:29.728 --> 51:33.198
He's right. I don't think
you can get across.

51:36.635 --> 51:39.138
George, you heard the doctor.

51:39.238 --> 51:41.507
They'll fix the cell tower,
we'll call Houston,

51:41.607 --> 51:43.776
and then you'll finish the mission.

51:59.090 --> 52:00.692
Good day.

52:00.792 --> 52:04.329
Andrew, tell 'em we're looking
for a monkey in a spacesuit.

52:04.429 --> 52:09.334
We are looking for a monkey
in a spacesuit.

52:09.434 --> 52:11.270
Not in English.

52:11.970 --> 52:14.339
We speak English.

52:15.240 --> 52:18.677
Well done, Andrew.
Have you seen the monkey?

52:27.552 --> 52:29.087
You're not my monkey!

52:29.187 --> 52:33.258
And I don't suppose you're going to be able
to tell me where you found that suit?

52:36.461 --> 52:39.198
Well, Andrew, back to our search.

52:39.298 --> 52:41.367
Sir, you better take a look at this.

52:41.967 --> 52:44.536
There's a category 5 storm approaching.

52:45.136 --> 52:48.473
One, two, three, four, five.
That's a lot of categories.

52:48.573 --> 52:51.910
Better have the search team
return to base. Us, too.

52:52.010 --> 52:54.479
What about Ted and George?

52:54.579 --> 52:56.882
Oh, this is not good.

52:56.982 --> 53:01.720
I did not need a storm now, Andrew.
I did not need this storm.

53:10.662 --> 53:13.098
George, what's going on?

53:19.674 --> 53:24.043
- That's some storm.
- Rain's coming. Better get prepared.

53:24.676 --> 53:28.614
- I see. Is it gonna flood?
- I hope not.

53:30.682 --> 53:34.586
Gee, I wish we could let Mr. Houston
know about the capsule right now.

53:34.686 --> 53:40.157
I do, too. There's a good chance
the rain will wash it away.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.996
But then the RDS could get destroyed.

53:44.096 --> 53:46.632
That could be the end
of Project Stop Flooding.

53:47.298 --> 53:49.134
I'm afraid so, Ted.

53:49.534 --> 53:51.336
No.

53:53.872 --> 53:55.440
Now, I'm sorry, George.

53:55.540 --> 54:00.045
I know you want to get the RDS,
but you know it's impossible.

54:01.646 --> 54:04.516
Well, it's very dangerous.

54:05.283 --> 54:07.269
But maybe not impossible.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.391
No, it's not a good idea.

54:15.627 --> 54:18.096
No, we're not going.

54:24.002 --> 54:26.471
You agree with me, right?

54:27.072 --> 54:31.076
Don't ask my opinion.
You don't want to hear it.

54:39.584 --> 54:42.487
Okay. Let's give it a shot.

54:47.092 --> 54:49.261
Good luck. I wish I could go with you,

54:49.361 --> 54:52.063
but I have to stay here
and take care of the animals.

54:52.163 --> 54:57.436
Hopefully, the old bridge is still there.
And hopefully, it's still passable.

54:59.438 --> 55:01.840
Almost got it.

55:03.108 --> 55:05.844
Here we go. Bye!

55:14.786 --> 55:16.221
Careful with that map, George.

55:16.321 --> 55:20.625
That's what's keeping this adventure
from becoming a bad-venture.

55:20.972 --> 55:23.060
I just thought of that.

55:33.404 --> 55:36.603
Strich? What are you doing here?

55:56.394 --> 55:57.462
Well...

55:58.163 --> 56:00.598
guess this is where we get out.

56:04.169 --> 56:06.404
Oh, no.

56:09.841 --> 56:13.111
Come on. Come on, everyone.

56:21.686 --> 56:25.890
I don't believe it.
We made it to the capsule.

56:28.993 --> 56:33.397
We almost made it to the capsule.

56:37.536 --> 56:42.240
Sorry, George. I know
you really wanted to get there.

56:48.713 --> 56:50.582
George...

56:53.952 --> 56:56.789
I don't think that bridge is safe.

56:58.790 --> 57:01.993
I don't think it's on the same
continent as safe.

57:08.233 --> 57:10.301
Oh, boy.

57:19.878 --> 57:22.314
George, this is nuts!

57:25.717 --> 57:29.588
Don't look down, Ted.
In fact, don't look anywhere.

57:41.933 --> 57:43.768
Sweet.

57:49.808 --> 57:52.477
I got the hang of this adventure thing.

57:52.577 --> 57:54.579
Follow me, George.

58:01.319 --> 58:03.187
Crocodile!

58:18.469 --> 58:22.190
Perhaps you haven't noticed!
I'm not a monkey!

58:26.010 --> 58:28.212
Oh, boy.

58:29.681 --> 58:31.750
Monkey see, monkey do!

58:37.288 --> 58:39.057
Yes!

59:03.915 --> 59:05.930
Looks good as new.

59:10.255 --> 59:14.726
The radio still works?
This is our ticket home, George!

59:14.926 --> 59:17.629
Let's see. There must be a switch.

59:27.972 --> 59:31.175
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

59:32.176 --> 59:34.546
Other than those lion cubs?

59:35.246 --> 59:40.785
George, don't you know if there's cubs,
that probably means there's a mama?

59:43.354 --> 59:45.323
Or papa?

59:56.801 --> 59:59.003
Let's get out of here.

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:56.962
What are you doing, George?
We don't want him to follow us.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.533
Oh, you're saving the lion.

01:01:02.133 --> 01:01:04.335
Hang on, lion!

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:23.588
Nice job, George.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.730
Now I think it's our turn
to get rescued.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:38.437
All this waiting, Andrew.
I want an ETA and I want it now!

01:01:39.137 --> 01:01:41.673
Sir, the hot chocolate
will be ready in five minutes.

01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:43.141
I can live with that.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.978
<i>This is Ted calling for Mr. Houston.
Please, come in.</i>

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.847
Ted, Hal Houston here!

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.017
He's there! Mr. Houston. I found George.

01:01:53.217 --> 01:01:56.810
We got him! That's astonishing, Ted!

01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:59.958
And we retrieved the RDS
from the capsule.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.927
Holy Canaveral! You're heroes.

01:02:03.127 --> 01:02:04.429
Can you come get us?

01:02:05.897 --> 01:02:09.467
You'll have to sit tight. We can't
get to you until after the storm.

01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:11.136
There may be flooding.

01:02:11.736 --> 01:02:13.838
Oh, no.

01:02:16.207 --> 01:02:17.809
- Sir?
- Not now, Andrew.

01:02:17.909 --> 01:02:21.179
But, sir, if Ted and George
could get to the satellite tower

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.916
and install the RDS,
that could stop the flooding.

01:02:25.016 --> 01:02:28.787
Andrew, that's the most
ridiculous thing I...

01:02:28.887 --> 01:02:32.323
Actually, it would.

01:02:33.024 --> 01:02:36.628
Well, that's a tall order.
What do you say, boys?

01:02:37.028 --> 01:02:39.597
Quite an ambitious plan.

01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:46.371
But I've already crossed half a jungle,

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:49.974
swung on a vine
and faced down a lion, so...

01:02:50.074 --> 01:02:54.345
What's another many-mile jaunt
through wild animals and hostile terrain?

01:02:56.331 --> 01:03:00.485
We picked the right crew for this job.
Bring 'em home, Andrew.

01:03:00.785 --> 01:03:02.854
I've locked on your signal
and I know where you are.

01:03:02.954 --> 01:03:07.158
<i>Go down the ravine to the Big River.
Go up the river to Louis Leakey Dam.</i>

01:03:07.258 --> 01:03:11.028
<i>The satellite tower is on top.
You can't miss it.</i>

01:03:12.563 --> 01:03:15.667
Ravine, Big River, tower. Got it!

01:03:15.767 --> 01:03:17.702
<i>I'll tell the dam you're on your way.</i>

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:20.955
Good luck. And take care of that RDS.

01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:24.141
Team 6 is on it.

01:03:38.556 --> 01:03:40.791
The RDS!

01:03:41.492 --> 01:03:42.994
Oh, George, wait!

01:03:43.494 --> 01:03:46.631
I'm a vine-swinging rookie, remember?

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.101
You mean me? Up there?

01:03:51.502 --> 01:03:53.537
Oh, boy.

01:04:31.509 --> 01:04:34.044
We've got him now.

01:04:38.783 --> 01:04:43.087
I read somewhere that animals
are as afraid of us as we are of them.

01:04:44.655 --> 01:04:49.026
Which means he's very, very afraid.

01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:53.376
No, George.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:13.318
You just sent him packing.

01:05:14.919 --> 01:05:16.654
Oh, hi!

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:27.399
You make the best friends, George.

01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.304
Well, the good news is
we have the RDS back.

01:05:34.672 --> 01:05:38.376
The bad news is I have
no idea where we are.

01:05:44.715 --> 01:05:47.118
Looks like an old log flume.

01:05:50.721 --> 01:05:52.773
What? The log flume?

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:56.694
Good idea, George.
It should lead us to the river.

01:06:03.067 --> 01:06:06.304
We'll be okay, Strich.
You can go on home.

01:06:09.557 --> 01:06:13.127
- Thanks for your help!
- Bye!

01:06:26.624 --> 01:06:29.427
- We have to be getting close.
- Hey!

01:06:34.364 --> 01:06:36.200
Thanks.

01:06:36.552 --> 01:06:39.304
I think... Yes! Look!

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.456
The Big River!

01:06:46.344 --> 01:06:48.446
Oh, no!

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.765
Does this thing come with brakes?

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:04.195
Oh, no! We're going the wrong way!

01:07:07.665 --> 01:07:10.601
Oh, boy. What are we gonna do?

01:07:16.274 --> 01:07:19.209
Hey, George, that's my plane.

01:07:30.771 --> 01:07:32.706
We got this.

01:08:55.805 --> 01:08:57.375
Oh, yeah!

01:09:01.578 --> 01:09:02.981
Bye!

01:09:19.964 --> 01:09:22.667
Oh, no. The pontoon is loose!

01:09:23.968 --> 01:09:27.237
George, you're gonna have
to take the control.

01:09:28.471 --> 01:09:32.142
Sure, if I can fly a plane, you can.

01:09:38.314 --> 01:09:43.620
Just go straight, and when I say to,
pull back on that steering wheel thing.

01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:55.636
Better pull up, George.

01:10:02.606 --> 01:10:04.908
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up!

01:10:17.021 --> 01:10:18.556
Oh, no.

01:10:19.056 --> 01:10:22.927
Well, nothing we can do now.
Nice work, pilot.

01:10:24.028 --> 01:10:26.063
I'll take it from here.

01:10:41.045 --> 01:10:43.914
There's Leakey Dam and the tower.

01:10:52.923 --> 01:10:55.192
Right, George. The dock.

01:10:55.993 --> 01:10:58.529
We just have to set down...

01:10:58.929 --> 01:11:01.431
with only one pontoon.

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:09.240
Okay, lean left.

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:33.196
All right, George!

01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:39.137
Hey! We were expecting you!

01:11:40.871 --> 01:11:44.909
- We need to get to your satellite tower.
- There's no way up in this rain.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:48.094
Not a problem. We've got George.

01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:08.031
Oh, this doesn't look good.

01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:28.385
It was a good try.

01:12:29.086 --> 01:12:31.655
After all this.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.994
Let's go inside.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.355
You know something, George?

01:12:44.455 --> 01:12:48.572
I think this may be one of those times
we throw caution to the wind.

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:55.712
What is he doing?

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.315
George?

01:12:58.215 --> 01:13:00.036
You ready to go fly a kite?

01:13:06.574 --> 01:13:09.576
Good luck, Space Monkey George.

01:13:57.941 --> 01:13:59.477
Yeah!

01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:02.296
George!

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:05.015
That's some monkey.

01:14:10.254 --> 01:14:12.773
Is that what I think it is?

01:14:13.023 --> 01:14:16.827
<i>Project Stop Flooding activated.</i>

01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:33.094
The water's receding!

01:14:44.454 --> 01:14:48.025
That was amazing, George.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.331
I'll go on an adventure
with you any time.

01:15:19.089 --> 01:15:25.028
Space Monkey George,
I present you with this hero's medal.

01:15:27.164 --> 01:15:29.517
- Don't think we forgot you, Ted.
- For me?

01:15:29.617 --> 01:15:31.885
- Yup.
- Really?

01:15:41.178 --> 01:15:43.713
Congratulations!

01:15:49.386 --> 01:15:52.490
Ted, George, a gift.
Next time you won't need a kite.

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:54.925
Oh, my.

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.745
Yeah!

01:16:09.305 --> 01:16:15.427
