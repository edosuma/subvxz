The Amazing Race...

00:03.655 --> 00:06.413
Ten teams began a Mega Leg

00:06.517 --> 00:07.724
-in Bologna, Italy.

two Roadblocks, two cities.

00:10.724 --> 00:11.965

00:12.068 --> 00:14.103

how this tool works.

any science background

couldn't get it into gear.

00:21.965 --> 00:25.310

What am I doing wrong?

00:25.413 --> 00:28.000
But Emily's Roadblock skills
revved them up.

00:28.103 --> 00:30.517

00:42.965 --> 00:45.862
-LUMUMBA: Still with me, babe?
-GLENDA: I'm still
with you, babe.

00:45.965 --> 00:47.344
Even though we were
so far behind everybody,

00:47.448 --> 00:50.793
I was confident
in my husband's skills.

00:50.896 --> 00:53.000
-Do it right, then do it fast.
-Check.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.551

We are heading
to the Villa Bardini.

01:18.655 --> 01:21.448
Should be a pretty long ride.

01:21.551 --> 01:25.000
Everyone always has a leg
where they struggle,

01:25.103 --> 01:27.620
and nothing is gonna help
but getting to that task

01:27.724 --> 01:28.862
-Yeah.
-and knocking it out
to the best of our ability.

01:28.965 --> 01:31.172
We're hungry.
We don't want to go home.

01:31.275 --> 01:33.068

01:41.172 --> 01:42.241
MARCUS:
Okay.

01:42.344 --> 01:44.827
We are in the middle
of the Mega Leg.

01:44.931 --> 01:47.137
Essentially, the Mega Leg
is double everything.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.586
We left the first Roadblock
in first.

01:49.689 --> 01:51.793
We've done a leg, but, you know,
we're here for the race,

01:51.896 --> 01:54.068
and so I can do
two more legs right now.

01:54.172 --> 01:55.378
It's all good.

01:56.482 --> 01:58.413
EMILY: What a morning.

01:58.517 --> 02:02.448
MOLLY: We jumped from,
I think, eighth to second,

02:02.551 --> 02:04.827
because my sister killed it.

02:04.931 --> 02:06.689
So far, the only contestants

02:06.793 --> 02:09.205
we've been worried about
are the brothers.

02:09.310 --> 02:10.620
This is nuts.

02:10.723 --> 02:13.551
They're accustomed
to driving internationally,

02:13.655 --> 02:16.206
so they're getting
to these challenges quicker.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.862
If we can get them out
of their comfort zone,

02:17.965 --> 02:20.379
maybe we'll have
an equal chance with them.

02:20.482 --> 02:23.068
EMILY:
Well, at least
we have teams behind us.

02:24.724 --> 02:26.793
We're going to Firenze.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.689
-We're going to Florence, Italy.
-Florence.

02:29.724 --> 02:32.206
Honestly, I don't know
anything about Florence.

02:33.241 --> 02:36.862
Florence, Italy or,
as the Italians say, Firenze.

02:36.965 --> 02:39.448
MATTIE:
Now we just have to
mentally reset,

02:39.551 --> 02:41.448
'cause it's a Mega Leg.

02:42.482 --> 02:45.103
WILL:
Round two, we're still alive.
I'm feeling a little tired.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.413
It took me a while to finish up
building the Ducati.

02:48.517 --> 02:51.103
As long as we're not eliminated,
I'm happy. [chuckles]

02:51.206 --> 02:54.793
Our confidence has
taken a hit during the Mega Leg,

02:54.896 --> 02:57.241
but I feel confident in Derek,
and I feel confident

02:57.344 --> 02:59.793
in our partnership
and navigation.

02:59.896 --> 03:02.724
So that's what
I'm gonna rely on.

03:05.275 --> 03:06.586
SHARIK:
I think our Roadblock strategy

03:06.689 --> 03:08.793
has actually
been pretty good so far.

03:08.896 --> 03:12.137
My dad has now done three,
and I've done zero.

03:12.241 --> 03:16.137
The reason for that
is because I have anxiety.

03:16.241 --> 03:17.793
Just in general,
I'm an anxious person.

03:17.896 --> 03:20.758
So I was a little hesitant
to just even get started.

03:20.862 --> 03:22.793
But since it's a Mega Leg,

03:22.896 --> 03:24.448
I'll more than likely
do the next one.

03:24.551 --> 03:26.655
And then hopefully we're
headed to see Phil on the mat,

03:26.758 --> 03:27.862
because I...

03:27.965 --> 03:29.620
I'm tired.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.137
Let's set the intention to

03:33.241 --> 03:36.241
move up in ranking
to group one or group two.

Yeah, he's got his camera.

19:05.620 --> 19:08.379

-Okay.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.034

We had to look
at all of the details.

Tan, black leather vest.
He's holding a purple flower.

19:14.793 --> 19:18.793
I was looking at color,
jewelry, accessories, shoes.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.758
Got crazy necklace and something
wrapped around his ear.

19:20.862 --> 19:23.034
I have a pretty
good photographic memory,

19:23.137 --> 19:24.896
so I was just taking a snapshot.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.068
-Okay. Left here. Right.
-Make a right. Okay.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.689
So now we're gonna
go to della Repubblica.

Oh.

19:47.793 --> 19:50.000
When I reread the clue,

19:50.103 --> 19:53.103
I realized it was to chisel out

19:53.206 --> 19:55.448
what was already there,
which makes complete sense.

all in, like we were.

It's right in front of you.

I'll take the left.

22:41.241 --> 22:44.068
So once we saw
three photography sets,

we had to run
to put in the sketchbooks

22:48.517 --> 22:50.896

of the models that we saw.
-The models.

All right, you got it, Sharik.

23:30.965 --> 23:32.000
No.

23:33.689 --> 23:34.965
I...

23:35.068 --> 23:37.000
Those aren't holes, though.
Okay, just...

23:37.103 --> 23:38.655
Okay, I'll clean it up.
All right.

You got it.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.137

I'm over it.

Stay focused.
You got it. You got it.

23:45.827 --> 23:47.896
-I am focused, Dad.
I am focused.
-Stay focused. You got it.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.655

-I'm... Dad.

23:49.758 --> 23:51.655
LINTON:
You got it.

23:52.689 --> 23:54.931
-ABBY: Okay, where are we going?
-Across the Ponte Vecchio,
Abby.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.137
ABBY:
Ooh!

23:56.241 --> 23:58.310
WILL:
This is Piazza de' Rucellai,

23:58.413 --> 24:00.344
-which is what we needed.
-ABBY: Oh, look.

24:00.448 --> 24:02.000
Red and yellow flowers.

24:02.103 --> 24:04.000
-The window's right there.
-Okay.

24:04.103 --> 24:05.862
Grazie.

24:05.965 --> 24:07.172
Each restaurant we went to
to pick up food

24:07.275 --> 24:08.931
had a-a cool
kind of little window,

24:09.034 --> 24:10.931
very small, that went
into the restaurant,

24:11.034 --> 24:12.724
and we had
to go through the window,

24:12.827 --> 24:14.586
and then grab
whatever they gave us.

24:14.689 --> 24:18.586
We got... looks like a
risotto-type thing. Looks tasty.
-Something. Yeah.

24:18.689 --> 24:20.379
-Okay. Where are we going?
-Off to the next one.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.344
So it's right here somewhere.

24:23.448 --> 24:25.931
-Do you see a sign? Okay.
-It's right here.

24:26.034 --> 24:27.379
-She's wearing black and blue.
Black and gold.

24:27.482 --> 24:28.862
DAVID:
Blue, black. Oh, bandana.

24:28.965 --> 24:30.965
He's wearing the bandana print.

24:31.068 --> 24:33.448
-That's it. I can remember that.
-All right, let's go.

24:33.551 --> 24:35.000
DAVID:
And then now
we got to work our way up.

24:36.793 --> 24:38.931
I have no idea what technique
the other people are using.

24:39.034 --> 24:43.413
I'm using my years of not
doing this to invent something.

24:43.517 --> 24:44.724
[chuckles]

24:48.172 --> 24:50.448
Can I get a check, please?

24:50.551 --> 24:52.241
It's got to be it.
This is it.

24:54.379 --> 24:57.241
-Fantastic. [chuckles]
-Good? Oh, thank God.

24:57.344 --> 24:59.586
-Yes!
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

24:59.689 --> 25:01.724
-LINTON: That's it.
-SHARIK: Sure, yay,

25:01.827 --> 25:04.827
got the clue, but at what cost?

25:04.931 --> 25:07.275
-I feel like crying,
and I don't want to cry.
-No, you did a great job.

25:07.379 --> 25:08.344
SHARIK:
You know, I was

25:08.448 --> 25:09.758
here chiseling away for, like,

25:09.862 --> 25:12.379
an hour and a half,
and my-my hands hurt.

25:12.482 --> 25:14.068
I can barely open the clue.

25:14.172 --> 25:15.517
-Window of Opportunity.
-Window of Opportunity?

25:15.620 --> 25:17.206
-Sure.
-LINTON: It was difficult.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.034
Yes, Dad, it was difficult.

25:19.137 --> 25:20.793
And you pulled through.

25:21.862 --> 25:23.448
SHARIK:
You definitely
should have done that one.

25:23.551 --> 25:25.172
-That was physical, for sure.
-But you did it, though.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.586
I'm proud of you.

25:26.689 --> 25:29.931
I know my dad was excited,
and I really wanted

25:30.034 --> 25:32.344
to be able to show up for him,
but, like,

25:32.448 --> 25:34.034
I could barely show up
for myself.

25:34.137 --> 25:36.000
I, like, don't even want to do
this anymore. This is terrible.

25:36.103 --> 25:37.275
Sharik, you got it.

25:37.379 --> 25:39.551
I set very strong
boundaries with myself,

25:39.655 --> 25:42.379
and once I feel
a boundary is going over,

25:42.482 --> 25:43.965
then I literally will be like,

25:44.068 --> 25:45.275
-"I'm not doing that."
-You got this, Sharik.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.000
-You did it. Sharik...
-I want to go home.

25:47.103 --> 25:49.448
No, I honestly do.
I'm not lying.

25:54.793 --> 25:57.000
-I want to go home.
-Sharik, stop.

25:57.103 --> 25:58.724
You got this. Come on. Stop.

25:58.827 --> 26:00.275
When it comes
to making decisions,

26:00.379 --> 26:02.965
I am strongheaded
about what I want to do.

26:03.068 --> 26:05.896
And then she might have another
opinion about what we should do.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.689
We're not quitters.

26:09.103 --> 26:11.689
-Michael. Right here.
-What?

26:11.793 --> 26:13.172
EMILY:
Oh, it's right here.

26:13.275 --> 26:14.586
Okay.

26:14.689 --> 26:17.206
All right. [mutters]

Oh...

26:23.068 --> 26:24.551
We went to

26:24.655 --> 26:25.620
take the exam,

26:25.724 --> 26:27.517
and it was a picture

26:27.620 --> 26:29.517
of the background at a piazza.

26:29.620 --> 26:32.862
Damn, 'cause I didn't
really look at the background.

26:32.965 --> 26:34.103
Okay.

26:34.206 --> 26:35.620
MOLLY:
All right, let's do one more.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.241
-That's the fir--
the last one, right?
-Last one.

26:37.344 --> 26:39.482
Thankfully,
she was keeping track

26:39.586 --> 26:43.862
of the images of the piazzas,
because I was thinking of names.

26:43.965 --> 26:45.344
Oh, wait, there's multiples.

26:45.448 --> 26:46.896
-EMILY: Don't talk too loud,
though.
-Okay.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.379
Check this out.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.517
-Signoria is the first one.
-That's the Signoria?

26:50.620 --> 26:51.586
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

26:51.689 --> 26:53.206
This is the right girl.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.034
-Is this one?
-This is different.

26:55.137 --> 26:56.517
And that's correct.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.482
Yeah, that's correct.
Can we get a check, please?

27:13.655 --> 27:15.689
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

27:15.793 --> 27:17.620
Do we have the places for stuff?

27:22.379 --> 27:23.379
You got this, sweetie.
