WEBVTT

05:27.928 --> 05:29.161
Hey stranger.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.763
How's it feel to be back?

05:31.765 --> 05:32.964
Where's your boy?

05:32.966 --> 05:33.832
He's inside.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.611
You okay?

05:46.613 --> 05:47.679
Yeah.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.483
Are you sure?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.551
Yeah.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.230
Are you almost done? I need to
rinse my hair in a sec.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.947
Why are you being so quiet?

06:21.949 --> 06:23.148
I'm just thinking.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.216
'bout what?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.753
We'll talk about
it when we get back.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.741
It was the limoncello year -

06:49.743 --> 06:53.412
It was. And she was like,
"girls, it's dessert."

06:54.581 --> 06:57.582
She used to get wasted on her
own.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.353
And she was, like, laughing hysterically,
and then she whipped off her pants -

07:01.355 --> 07:03.722
Oh my god, in the living room
when we were playing a game -

07:03.724 --> 07:05.891
It was so weird. Wait, pull it
back.

07:05.893 --> 07:11.863
She was just wearing this, like,
onesie. shirt-dress onesie

07:11.865 --> 07:17.169
And then she was laughing
hysterically, remember? She would laugh -

07:17.171 --> 07:22.107
And then she would
laugh and make herself fart -

07:22.843 --> 07:25.977
I haven't inherited that.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.213
That's really scary.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.248
I've been touching them all
summer.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.351
Well, you'd know if you
touched one of those. Trust me.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.421
Yeah, Dylan got one the other
day.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.723
What,
do they just latch into your skin?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.459
Well he just
kept itching his eyes.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.361
Yeah, we always had good
holidays.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.998
Remember that holiday in the south of France
- the one where it rained all the time?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.135
And I had to save you from those
BMX-er's in the park.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.538
That's when dad started calling
you my White Knight.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.906
Was it?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.008
He, uh,
sounds like a white supremacist.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.143
It's Arthurian.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.579
I know.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.947
No, that was when I used to pretend to
take you to those swimming lessons you hated.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.449
No, no, it was before that I'm
sure -

08:04.451 --> 08:09.020
Yeah, no, we used to play knock out ginger remember?
Then I'd wet your hair with the hose outside -

08:09.022 --> 08:11.923
No, no, no - it was when mum
grabbed my arm remember?

08:11.925 --> 08:15.694
She chased me down the hall and then you just
jumped out - out of nowhere - and were like:

08:15.696 --> 08:19.898
"I'll fucking kill you, I'll rip off
your head and shit down your neck!"

08:19.900 --> 08:20.799
Jesus. How old were you?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.167
She was ten!

08:22.169 --> 08:23.969
Ten years old and
already bustin' balls.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.614
♪ "When the boat comes in." ♪

08:38.352 --> 08:40.085
This game is fucking
pretentious.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.386
It's the oldest game in the
world.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.160
Oh, fuck you.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.430
Don't rage-quit just 'cause I'm
winning.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.566
Oh, like that time you threw a
strop at Orhan's

08:54.568 --> 08:56.268
because I invaded Enclave of the
Bear?

08:56.270 --> 08:58.470
We had an alliance, actually.

08:58.472 --> 09:01.106
Orhan still asks about you all
the time.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.674
Oh does he?

09:02.676 --> 09:05.010
Sexy Greta. Where is she?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.711
My sexy kebab woman, where is
she?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.246
Who, uh, who the fuck -

09:08.248 --> 09:09.080
Oh no.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.215
Who the fuck is...

09:11.018 --> 09:12.484
Who the fuck is Orhan?

09:12.486 --> 09:13.485
No one.

09:13.487 --> 09:14.853
Just an old mate from uni.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.822
Oh, just an old mate from uni is
he?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.357
Hitting on me wife?

09:20.427 --> 09:21.793
What the fuck kind of name is
Orhan?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.095
No one Bubba.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.864
Later Bubba.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.332
Hey!

09:27.334 --> 09:28.266
Wanna fly?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.167
Yeah.

09:31.004 --> 09:31.636
Ready?

09:31.638 --> 09:33.271
One, two, three -

09:46.820 --> 09:47.485
Kill it.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.687
No.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.955
It's only gonna bite you later
on, just -

09:49.957 --> 09:51.289
Just leave it.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.191
Too many legs.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.127
Shall we play one?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.462
Yeah, let's play one.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.131
Boom.

10:29.229 --> 10:29.928
AAAHH!

10:30.430 --> 10:32.697
Oh my God, you fuck!

10:32.699 --> 10:34.833
Seriously, who the fuck is
Orhan?

10:34.835 --> 10:36.735
Oh my god you're so jealous -

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
Yeah no, I'm not - I don't get
jealous.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.105
Yeah, right, right.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.072
I've never gotten jealous -

10:41.074 --> 10:42.674
Sarah Ashdown?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.443
Sarah Ashdown is not a name that
I even recall.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.513
You would, like, follow her. You
stalked her.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.881
I didn't stalk her.

10:49.883 --> 10:50.849
You totally stalked -

10:50.851 --> 10:53.451
I followed her -

10:53.453 --> 10:57.889
Yeah, that's not - it's
not stalking if there's two of you.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.960
Your freckles have
really gotten intense this year.

11:01.962 --> 11:02.894
Have they?

11:02.896 --> 11:05.397
They get more intense every
year.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.400
Freckles - it's like - y'know
- It's like a fine wine thing.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.836
They really - they mature, they
age, they enrich.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.007
You really bulked out.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.842
You're not a little twinkie
anymore.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.277
- I bulked out?
- Yeah.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.379
It took a while.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.620
You guys should stay the whole
week.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.423
I feel like we might have to go
back early.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.592
Does he just really not like it
here?

11:34.594 --> 11:35.627
No.

11:35.629 --> 11:39.164
I can tell you're lying because
your eyes do this thing.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.565
No they don't. What thing?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.367
They do this thing where they go
up to the corner.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.935
That just means I'm thinking.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.204
Yeah, thinking about the next
lie you're gonna tell.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.639
Okay.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.344
You should just talk to her
about it.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.547
Might make you feel better.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.515
That's not a good idea.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.017
No?

11:59.586 --> 12:00.885
Why not?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.654
- Because, she's just gonna try
to give me advice

12:02.656 --> 12:04.856
and then she'll get all annoyed
if I don't take it.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.725
She might do that.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.160
But, she might not do that also.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.197
- You can't even keep
a straight face and say that.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.599
She's not worse at that.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.600
Right.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.336
Come back more often.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.604
That's not fair.

12:19.606 --> 12:23.141
You know how busy I am - I've offered to
pay for her ticket, like, a million times.

12:23.143 --> 12:27.445
I think she sometimes feels like you're
trying to prove how much better your life is.

12:33.653 --> 12:38.189
If she'd have visited you more often I'm sure you
would have found her a much more appropriate husband.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.725
Yeah, she really did scrape the
barrel.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.095
She was. And there I was.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.267
Just you at the bottom?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.236
"I'm here."

12:51.238 --> 12:54.072
You know that feeling
when you scratch your armpit

12:54.074 --> 12:58.576
and then you're like... and you sniff
it, and then you take a sneaky lick?

12:58.578 --> 13:02.113
I was with you
right up until the end.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.385
I don't get hunting.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.020
Why?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.755
What do you get out of all this?
Of hurting animals?

13:10.757 --> 13:13.591
Joy. Deep pleasure.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.227
You're not gonna let it go if you catch
it, are you? You're gonna kill it.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.763
Yeah, only because this area is
overpopulated.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.733
I'm keeping the balance.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.034
Okay.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.736
I'm singlehandedly saving -

13:24.738 --> 13:27.272
- 'cause I can see all
of these rabbits - these rabid -

13:27.274 --> 13:29.040
- They're coming
after you - you gotta -

13:29.042 --> 13:30.842
running around the forest -

13:30.844 --> 13:32.977
- creating
ecological imbalance.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.847
Besides, you eat meat.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.848
I eat fish.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.316
That's, that's meat.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.185
No, fish don't feel pain in the
same way.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.719
Lobsters feel tons of pain.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.221
I don't know that you know that.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.322
I do know that.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.694
Those all dry?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.162
Yeah.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.178
I can't believe you convinced
her to start eating meat.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.848
You've brainwashed her.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.917
She just doesn't do everything
you say anymore.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.192
What you gonna do
when your contract ends?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.594
I was thinking of
getting a place near you guys.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.528
What just you?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.763
I meant "we."

14:58.765 --> 15:00.965
Not gonna go back to London?

15:01.601 --> 15:02.600
I miss you.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.701
Do you?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.703
Yeah,
I miss what we used to be like.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.672
You guys probably
wouldn't fit in here.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.642
I mean, who knows,
maybe it will just be me.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.712
What's going on with you two
anyway?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.347
I dunno.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.682
You seem really distant from
each other.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.350
Yeah, the move's been really
stressful.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.752
Well, how often do you guys
fuck?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.354
What?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.490
Fucking keeps you close to the person so
you're not just buddies who live together.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.625
That's your problem -

15:27.627 --> 15:31.029
If you're not having sex you start to look at
other people, and then you start to think:

15:31.031 --> 15:34.132
"maybe with that person the sexual
attraction will last forever."

15:34.134 --> 15:36.367
Sometimes you need to force yourself
to fuck the person you're with.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.370
Then sex just becomes a way to avoid
dealing with all your other problems -

15:39.372 --> 15:43.274
Otherwise things will fizzle out because you think you've lost
your attraction to them and your relationship becomes retarded.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.342
Don't use that word.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.577
Retarded: Held back. Restricted.

15:46.579 --> 15:50.548
So you force yourself to have sex with
Dylan, even though you don't want to?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.917
I'm just saying, you don't
exactly try that hard.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.486
You're a fucking exhibitionist.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.755
Sex is good for you.

15:57.757 --> 16:02.460
You need to show Caleb you love him. Maybe he's
getting out now before you can really hurt him.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.997
Relationships take work.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.801
It's not that they're shit all the time, and you're
compromising yourself. But you should try hard.

16:09.803 --> 16:14.572
Y'know, if you really love the person you wanna
do the work 'cause it doesn't feel like work.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.177
Not everyone has what you and
Dylan have.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.583
Yeah, that looks like plenty.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.719
You know how fast it burns?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.420
I do.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.489
'cause I'm a woodsman.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.791
There we go baby!

16:33.793 --> 16:36.928
You know when you chop wood you
look just like dad.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.697
That's not an insult. You have
his exact stance.

16:39.699 --> 16:45.436
I know, it's like... he did it
in such a... such a dainty way.

16:45.438 --> 16:50.508
He could do it really well,
but it was just like, so... fluid. Y'know?

16:50.510 --> 16:54.679
- It's like he was, like,
following the axe, follow the axe.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.316
It became like an extension of
his limbs.

16:58.318 --> 17:02.353
It was so - it was just like - all
his movements were so flopsy mopsy.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.857
He was really flopsy. Like,
so...

18:04.384 --> 18:06.284
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

18:24.003 --> 18:24.836
Night night.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.270
Goodnight.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.511
What?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.268
You look like shit.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.509
I was thinking on the drive over here
about this awful dream that I had.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.912
You were in the next room from
me...

20:14.914 --> 20:17.181
and I could hear you coughing
and breathing all weird -

20:17.183 --> 20:19.650
but I didn't think anything of it.
I thought maybe you just had...

20:19.652 --> 20:22.787
I don't know, the flu or
something, and...

20:22.789 --> 20:26.257
Finally I knew that something was
wrong so I went into the next room...

20:26.259 --> 20:29.860
And you were hanging from a belt
by your neck.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.999
and... I felt this horrible
sense of dread.

20:35.001 --> 20:40.471
Like, this whole time I'd just been sitting in
the next room while you were hanging yourself.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.707
What is wrong with you?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.276
You're so fucked up and twisted.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.545
I don't give a fuck about your
dream.

20:49.148 --> 20:52.183
I asked him to fucking do this.
I mean...

20:53.219 --> 20:55.086
I mean what the fuck is he
playing at?

20:55.521 --> 20:56.921
It's his family.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.191
Watch he's gonna turn up now and
act like nothing's happened

21:00.193 --> 21:03.527
and then I'm gonna look like a
bitch for being in a bad mood.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.863
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.499
You don't have to worry.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.035
There's like, fifty fucking people coming to this thing,
and I still haven't made the fucking ice cream.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.603
Well, I can do that.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.105
Yeah.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.373
What? I can.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.440
Fuck!

21:23.449 --> 21:29.253
Listen I don't wanna do this right now. If you can't
help me without starting a fight then just go inside.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.990
I'm not starting a fight. Greta.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.526
He insisted on hosting this year.
Motherfucker.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.094
He's taking advantage of you.

21:37.096 --> 21:37.828
Don't.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.163
They're not even your family.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.332
I know what you're doing.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.333
Stop.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.200
He's not good for you.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.403
Oh, 'cause you know what is?

21:47.340 --> 21:50.308
Y'know, I didn't even want you
guys coming here this year.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.844
It was Dylan's idea. He thought I
should give you a second chance.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.114
Look, I don't know what he told
you -

21:57.116 --> 22:00.518
You can't stand me being happy,
can you?

22:02.622 --> 22:04.422
I just want you to see him for
who he really is.

22:04.424 --> 22:08.626
You are so full of shit. It
blows my fucking mind.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.363
Can we just be honest for one
second?

22:13.066 --> 22:14.999
Honest?

22:16.903 --> 22:19.837
You know when Sheldon Val called
me a slut?

22:19.839 --> 22:23.841
You went to his house and you poured
bleach on his mum's flowerbeds.

22:25.244 --> 22:28.412
I begged you not to and you, you
did it anyway.

22:28.414 --> 22:31.215
And his family hated me then,
for years.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.018
And you went around feeling so
good.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.422
You landed this left hook on my behalf.
Everyone called you my White Knight.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.990
But you're not.

22:39.992 --> 22:46.097
It was more important for you to be my crusader
than to actually give a fuck about my feelings.

22:55.908 --> 22:59.377
Look. Greta, I understand how
hard this must be for you.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.681
Let's just pretend none of this
ever happened.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.516
Let's just...

23:05.518 --> 23:07.485
Reset.

23:07.487 --> 23:11.889
You've created a reality that is
completely different from everyone else's.

23:11.891 --> 23:16.761
Where you're this saint who gets
tricked into doing bad things.

23:16.763 --> 23:20.030
The truth is you never once
thought of me.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.099
I always thought of you.

23:22.101 --> 23:26.570
Maybe when we were kids you'd tell
yourself you were protecting me. But...

23:27.140 --> 23:29.106
you can't now, can you?

23:32.044 --> 23:37.181
So you wanna believe your version of
things Miriam. Go ahead. Believe in them.

23:37.183 --> 23:40.017
I bet it makes you feel fucking
righteous. But...

23:40.019 --> 23:43.220
don't for a minute pretend that
you're doing any of this shit for me.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.392
Are we done?

26:22.448 --> 26:24.415
Thought maybe you weren't
coming.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.251
Told her I was heading to the
farm a day early to help my parents.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.457
What if she calls the house?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.225
She won't.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.460
If she does?

26:38.264 --> 26:41.799
She leaves a message. I was cleaning the
barbecue, didn't hear the phone ring.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.968
What if she calls your mobile?

26:43.970 --> 26:45.369
I'll fake that I'm there.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.837
You fake that you're there?

26:46.839 --> 26:48.639
Yeah. What are you doing right
now?

26:49.241 --> 26:50.741
I don't know.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.277
I need a drink.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.913
I thought about
this all fucking day.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.050
In the shower.

27:33.052 --> 27:33.684
At work.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.020
On the drive over.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.958
Even fucking jerked off to you.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.361
Thanks for making me feel so
special.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.606
You know what I was thinking
about all day?

27:55.908 --> 27:57.007
What?

27:57.009 --> 28:01.979
I was thinking about that night
by the fire.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.982
I thought we were past that.

28:04.984 --> 28:09.153
I never heard how you felt.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.722
What it meant to you.

28:11.724 --> 28:12.723
Yeah?

28:12.725 --> 28:13.590
Yeah.

28:18.364 --> 28:22.032
It meant a lot. I have a vivid
memory of it.

28:23.602 --> 28:24.468
Vivid?

28:24.470 --> 28:25.569
I think about it all the time.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.207
So do I.

28:37.650 --> 28:38.816
You go.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.181
Tell me what you were thinking
about when you jerked off?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.451
You know what I was thinking
about.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.332
Tell me.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.423
We were by the fire.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.995
You were telling
me how mean I was.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.864
Don't go so far back.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.344
I ran my hand along your
thighs...

30:16.248 --> 30:18.015
along your back.

30:18.017 --> 30:22.119
You still had your swimsuit on,
which was sexy as fuck.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.158
And it was dark outside.

30:38.804 --> 30:39.770
Don't move.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.805
What are you doing?

31:06.265 --> 31:07.497
And?

31:15.774 --> 31:18.709
I pulled down your pants
and ran my hand along your ass.

31:21.814 --> 31:24.348
I found my way under your
swimsuit.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.218
How did I feel?

31:28.621 --> 31:29.853
Soft.

31:33.859 --> 31:35.125
Then what?

31:37.363 --> 31:38.962
My dick started to get hard.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.080
What was I doing?

32:00.986 --> 32:03.153
You were lying
there with your back to me.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.392
You pushed up against me.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.803
I started kissing your neck and
you let out this... moan.

32:19.805 --> 32:22.940
This soft, real sexy moan.

32:28.881 --> 32:29.947
Then what?

32:37.589 --> 32:41.959
I pulled over your swimsuit and took out my hard
cock and slowly slid it into your wet pussy.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.660
Was I wet?

32:43.662 --> 32:45.762
You were so wet. You wanted it
so fucking bad.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.698
Did I like it?

32:49.234 --> 32:51.635
You pressed your tight little
ass right into me.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.838
Did I say anything to you?

32:55.908 --> 32:57.674
You said "don't stop."

32:58.777 --> 32:59.443
Did you?

32:59.445 --> 33:00.610
No.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.079
No?

33:22.434 --> 33:24.368
Tell me what
you want me to do to you.

33:29.975 --> 33:36.046
I want you to grab my hard cock
and rub it all over your wet lips.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.715
And then what?

33:43.322 --> 33:45.856
I want you to tease me with the
tip of your tongue.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.826
Playing with the edge of my
cock.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.173
Then I want you to taste me.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.080
Yeah?

34:11.850 --> 34:12.916
Yeah.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.689
I have this dream

35:25.691 --> 35:31.561
this recurring dream where I go into
this tree, and there's a door in the tree

35:31.563 --> 35:37.267
and I go down this really long staircase and at the bottom there's
this old couple that lives there, and it's a house inside the tree.

35:37.269 --> 35:45.108
In the kitchen they have all of these boxes on the windowsill, and
in each one of the boxes is one of my cats that's passed away.

35:45.110 --> 35:51.014
But they're alive, they're not, like, skeletons of cats, they're
alive. So they open the box and the cat's there and it comes out.

35:51.016 --> 35:54.184
And, I can play with all of my
dead cats.

35:54.186 --> 35:59.389
And I just go into this tree and hang out
with this old couple and all of my cats.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.624
Aw.

36:02.895 --> 36:08.231
What happened to that chemistry
teacher that always used to say "top banana"?

36:08.233 --> 36:10.133
Yeah, remember Mr. Pink?

36:10.135 --> 36:11.101
Who's Mr. Pink?

36:11.103 --> 36:12.235
Chemistry.

36:12.237 --> 36:13.136
Mr. Bevan?

36:13.138 --> 36:15.539
Yes! Oh my God, he was so hot.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.174
No. You were the only one who
thought that.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.109
You could always see his nipples
through his shirt.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.378
Ew. Ew.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.812
His round little nips.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.247
He got fired.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.248
Why?

36:25.250 --> 36:27.918
He went on this big bender
and...

36:27.920 --> 36:30.387
like, fucked a bunch of
prostitutes in his office.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.689
How do you know all these
juicies?

36:32.691 --> 36:35.725
You're out of the loop. This is
common knowledge.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.994
What about that anorexic biology
teacher?

36:37.996 --> 36:40.197
Ms. Phelps?

36:40.966 --> 36:42.032
She died.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.602
Yeah, heart attack or stroke or
something.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.503
Shit.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.337
Remember Mr. Bergman?

36:47.339 --> 36:49.673
Oh my God yes! I loved him.

36:49.675 --> 36:53.043
They found a bunch of Nazi
peraphernalia in his basement.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.111
What?

36:55.113 --> 36:59.149
Yeah, like, medals and flags
and this giant swastika dildo -

36:59.151 --> 37:01.017
You shithead!

37:02.421 --> 37:03.787
Did Ms. Phelps actually die?

37:03.789 --> 37:04.888
Uh, no.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.556
You fucker!

37:06.558 --> 37:08.325
She's still there.

37:12.431 --> 37:16.066
I fully believed you. You total
fucker.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.436
How fucking drunk are you?

37:19.438 --> 37:22.272
You are so mean.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.307
You bought it.

37:38.390 --> 37:42.525
Oh, my God. Oh my God. I'm -
I'm so sorry.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.794
I'm so sorry.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.197
It's okay.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.032
My God, I'm so shitty.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.569
- It meant nothing.
It didn't mean anything.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.437
Everybody's shitty.

37:54.439 --> 37:58.708
Everybody's at least medium
shitty. It's okay.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.044
I do really selfish things.

38:01.046 --> 38:04.180
What - why? Why do you think
that?

38:04.182 --> 38:06.249
I kissed my sister's husband!

38:06.251 --> 38:09.085
Okay, you - okay. Okay.

38:10.689 --> 38:15.392
Sometimes I pretend to be really sick,
so that Caleb will look after me all day.

38:15.394 --> 38:19.996
I pretend I only get one week of vacation
so I don't have to see my mum as much.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.665
I love your mum.

38:22.267 --> 38:26.803
Yeah, I know that you do.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.272
Why would you do that?

38:29.274 --> 38:32.409
I don't know. I wanna do it.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.683
I guess we're just both awful
fucking people.

38:43.221 --> 38:50.026
And Caleb's always trying so hard and I'm always
in this horrid position of having to reject him.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.530
You're too hard on yourself.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.838
We haven't had sex in almost a
year.

39:04.376 --> 39:05.442
Why?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.177
I don't know.

39:07.179 --> 39:08.912
Does he have an anteater penis?

39:08.914 --> 39:10.113
What?

39:10.115 --> 39:14.050
Like, a long, like, foreskin...

39:14.920 --> 39:17.020
What is that?

39:17.689 --> 39:18.955
Tell me.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.794
I only wanna fuck him when I'm
drunk.

39:24.796 --> 39:28.031
I know that sounds weird.

39:29.901 --> 39:34.971
And I want to be attracted to him again.
I just... don't know how.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.577
You can't force yourself to be
attracted to someone.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.246
Maybe I'm just not trying hard
enough.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.749
Or maybe he's not right for you.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.817
I want him to be right for me.

39:51.790 --> 39:55.358
It's not like you have a choice
in it.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.360
Free will is an illusion.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.397
You sound like Sam Harris.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.564
What's wrong with Sammy?

40:01.967 --> 40:03.099
Sammy?

40:03.101 --> 40:05.835
He's not Sammy Davis Jr.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.539
- I don't think
Sammy's a name that he has.

40:09.541 --> 40:13.943
But think about it - do you
choose your feelings?

40:14.446 --> 40:16.613
That's different.

40:16.615 --> 40:20.850
Okay, what about your thoughts? Right now
are you in control of what thoughts appear?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.152
Yeah, actually.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.219
Really?

40:23.221 --> 40:29.426
Like, right now I'm choosing to
think that you're being a cunt.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.064
Cock face.

40:39.204 --> 40:43.940
Is that your cock face? It's
like Sean Connery.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.543
Why does your cock look like
Sean Connery?

40:46.545 --> 40:51.281
I think that question answers itself.
Why does my cock look like Sean Connery?

40:51.283 --> 40:54.684
What cock doesn't look like Sean Connery?
It's a compliment.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.920
Mine looks like De Niro.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.455
Your cock looks like De Niro?

41:01.326 --> 41:06.262
Like that. It's the face of a
cock.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.768
Why is one eye all swollen?

41:16.241 --> 41:17.307
Stop it!

41:17.309 --> 41:21.411
It's the one eye more closed
than the other.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.292
Do you think I'm a good person?

41:37.963 --> 41:39.162
No.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.663
Seriously though.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.803
I think it's like what Lennon
said:

41:46.805 --> 41:53.843
"We're all Hitler, we're all Christ, and we
just have to work on the good parts of us."

41:54.880 --> 41:56.980
And then he beat his wife.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.651
Doesn't make it not true.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.486
That was the Hitler part.

42:03.488 --> 42:06.089
That was, that was the Hitler
part.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.691
The Christ past
was singing "Imagine."

42:09.761 --> 42:14.130
Y'know we're complicated people.
Nobody's simple.

42:24.509 --> 42:27.210
But how much of me is Hitler?

42:27.212 --> 42:28.745
I don't know.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.682
Probably more than most people.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.384
Definitely the moustache.

42:34.386 --> 42:39.889
For you? I think it's more the
hating the Jews...

42:39.891 --> 42:44.794
than the moustache. But the
moustache also doesn't help.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.607
I think you're a good person.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.414
I like that you think that. It's
nice.

43:06.318 --> 43:09.018
If it helps I'm sure Greta
doesn't think I'm good.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.353
She does.

43:17.996 --> 43:19.562
I like talking to you.

43:19.564 --> 43:21.731
I like talking to you. You
weirdo.

45:56.621 --> 45:58.921
I've wanted you for years.

46:49.908 --> 46:50.940
Don't.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.310
Stop.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.342
Ah!

58:37.982 --> 58:39.414
Ah!

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:12.267
Your heart's racing.

1:06:13.870 --> 1:06:15.670
You're so warm.

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:18.606
You're freezing.

1:06:22.946 --> 1:06:24.346
You still drunk?

1:06:24.348 --> 1:06:25.747
Do I smell?

1:06:26.650 --> 1:06:28.116
I don't mind.

1:06:28.118 --> 1:06:29.517
Liar.

1:06:31.722 --> 1:06:34.656
I don't understand why you have
to get so shit-faced.

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:52.340
What time is it?

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:54.509
I dunno. It's early.

1:06:55.479 --> 1:06:57.178
Try and get some sleep.

1:06:57.180 --> 1:06:58.913
I wanna fuck.

1:06:58.915 --> 1:07:01.649
No, that's not a good idea.

1:07:01.651 --> 1:07:03.051
Not like this.

1:07:04.421 --> 1:07:05.920
But you're hard.

1:07:16.967 --> 1:07:18.666
Come on. What are you doing?

1:07:28.445 --> 1:07:29.778
What is this?

1:07:31.715 --> 1:07:35.150
Why do you have to be such a girl about it?
Why can't we just fuck?

1:07:35.152 --> 1:07:37.118
I'm not gonna fuck you if you
insult me.

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:38.853
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:07:38.855 --> 1:07:41.022
Don't.

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:45.960
Miriam, you're drunk.

1:07:45.962 --> 1:07:47.562
I wanna be close to you.

1:07:48.765 --> 1:07:50.165
What, do I repulse you sober?

1:07:50.167 --> 1:07:52.067
No. I wanna make you feel good.

1:08:58.435 --> 1:09:00.468
Ow. Fuck.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:04.506
Hey!

1:09:07.277 --> 1:09:08.810
You alright?

1:09:11.081 --> 1:09:12.580
Don't touch me.

1:09:19.956 --> 1:09:21.022
C'mon.

1:09:34.437 --> 1:09:37.805
Look, I'm feeling fucking guilty.
You're feeling guilty.

1:09:37.807 --> 1:09:39.474
- Why would
I be feeling guilty?

1:09:39.476 --> 1:09:41.276
- and it never
should've happened.

1:09:41.278 --> 1:09:42.410
we fucked up.

1:09:42.412 --> 1:09:44.179
You fucked up.

1:09:46.016 --> 1:09:47.615
Don't do that.

1:09:47.617 --> 1:09:49.984
I was asleep and you fucked me.

1:09:57.827 --> 1:10:00.228
You think that I...

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:05.066
Really?

1:10:07.938 --> 1:10:09.237
Come on.

1:10:13.743 --> 1:10:15.176
Look, I'm -

1:10:18.481 --> 1:10:25.420
- I'm not gonna talk to Greta.
I just wanna sort this out between us -

1:10:25.422 --> 1:10:29.090
- That you kissed me?
That you made a choice to kiss me?

1:10:29.092 --> 1:10:30.792
No,
I told you that didn't mean anything.

1:10:30.794 --> 1:10:33.628
Yeah, yeah.
You were pressing up against me -

1:10:33.630 --> 1:10:37.665
No I wasn't! I didn't -

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:40.501
We had a lot to drink.

1:10:40.503 --> 1:10:44.839
don't rewrite what happened.

1:10:44.841 --> 1:10:48.276
- No, you did
things, you said things.

1:10:48.278 --> 1:10:50.945
- and you stayed - we both
said it was a mistake and we both stayed.

1:10:50.947 --> 1:10:53.881
Why did you tell me about your
fucking, your sex life with Caleb?

1:10:53.883 --> 1:10:56.184
- I was just trying
to work out what I was -

1:10:56.186 --> 1:10:58.353
- what so now
you're accusing me of -

1:10:58.355 --> 1:10:59.821
You said that actually -

1:10:59.823 --> 1:11:01.256
- Let's not fucking
fight over who said what.

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:03.024
None of it fucking matters.
I didn't want it.

1:11:03.026 --> 1:11:07.161
That - that,
that is a fucking lie and you know it!

1:11:09.566 --> 1:11:12.700
I thought you
were better than that.

1:11:22.012 --> 1:11:26.514
I'm sorry. We're gonna work this
out.

1:11:26.516 --> 1:11:27.882
It's gonna be okay.

1:11:27.884 --> 1:11:29.617
No, it's not.

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:33.388
I didn't mean to blame you, I
know that I'm half to blame.

1:11:33.390 --> 1:11:34.389
I don't know you.

1:11:34.391 --> 1:11:35.857
You know me.

1:11:37.861 --> 1:11:38.993
Don't say that.

1:11:46.936 --> 1:11:49.137
I know we fucked up. Okay?

1:11:50.507 --> 1:11:54.942
You're right. But the truth is

1:11:54.944 --> 1:11:59.547
I'm glad we got it out of our system.
I know that's a fucked up thing to say

1:11:59.549 --> 1:12:04.619
but look at me and say you haven't thought about it before
'cause I know you have or you woundn't have kissed me.

1:12:04.621 --> 1:12:07.088
What is it that you're doing
right now?

1:12:07.090 --> 1:12:10.925
You told me last night
that you do selfish things -

1:12:10.927 --> 1:12:14.362
and I should have realized that when you
kissed me, I should have stopped things but -

1:12:14.364 --> 1:12:15.897
I did stop things.

1:12:15.899 --> 1:12:19.267
- You were emotionally
vulnerable. Touching -

1:12:19.269 --> 1:12:25.106
In confidence, I opened up to you about things I
was really ashamed of, 'cause I wanted your help.

1:12:27.644 --> 1:12:30.611
I don't mean you're a bad
person.

1:12:33.350 --> 1:12:35.883
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

1:12:38.154 --> 1:12:46.160
You guys have always had this fucked
up sister thing. You're resentful.

1:12:49.299 --> 1:12:55.570
All I'm saying is, you and me,
we're in this together.

1:12:55.572 --> 1:13:01.743
And we've hurt each other
but we care about each other.

1:13:04.114 --> 1:13:05.380
Okay.

1:19:15.218 --> 1:19:19.453
♪ Call us back,
do doot do do, call us back... ♪

1:19:23.926 --> 1:19:27.394
Hey. It's me. Um...

1:19:28.498 --> 1:19:31.565
You're not picking up so...

1:19:31.567 --> 1:19:36.270
Look, I don't wanna fight, okay? I don't wanna go
to your parents' thing without sorting things out.

1:19:36.272 --> 1:19:40.307
I'm ready to talk when you are.
Just call me back.

1:25:42.204 --> 1:25:43.170
Oi!

1:25:43.772 --> 1:25:44.805
Hey!

1:25:45.374 --> 1:25:46.673
Hey.

1:25:46.675 --> 1:25:48.675
Give those back to her. Give
those back to her.

1:25:49.278 --> 1:25:50.277
Who the fuck are you?

1:25:50.279 --> 1:25:51.678
Give them back right now.

1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:53.614
HUH?

1:25:53.616 --> 1:25:55.048
I fucking saw you. Okay,
I have it on my phone, I fucking saw you.

1:25:55.050 --> 1:25:56.383
You saw me?

1:25:56.385 --> 1:25:57.651
Are you okay?

1:25:57.653 --> 1:25:58.685
- It's okay.
Don't worry, I'm fine.

1:25:58.687 --> 1:26:00.254
Go back in my car?

1:26:00.256 --> 1:26:01.922
Or what?
Or fucking what mate? Or what?

1:26:01.924 --> 1:26:03.123
Did he hurt you?

1:26:03.125 --> 1:26:05.092
You stop!

1:26:05.094 --> 1:26:06.593
- Are you gonna fucking let
her speak? Or are you just gonna speak?

1:26:06.595 --> 1:26:08.829
Are you just gonna get up -

1:26:08.831 --> 1:26:11.465
You think you scare me?

1:26:11.467 --> 1:26:14.268
- Or what,
or fucking what mate?

1:26:14.270 --> 1:26:16.737
You think you scare me? You
fucking don't. Yeah, I know men like you -

1:26:16.739 --> 1:26:19.239
Don't fucking touch me mate.
Don't fucking touch me.

1:26:19.241 --> 1:26:20.707
Go back in your
car, do you understand?

1:26:20.709 --> 1:26:24.745
Or what? Or fucking what mate?
Or fucking what?

1:26:24.747 --> 1:26:26.713
Please,
don't speak to him like that.

1:26:26.715 --> 1:26:29.116
Stop, stop, stop.

1:26:29.118 --> 1:26:32.186
It's okay. It's nothing.

1:30:57.419 --> 1:30:59.386
I can't believe you
convinced me to do this.

1:31:01.690 --> 1:31:04.324
I promise you
it's - it's good for you.

1:31:04.326 --> 1:31:05.725
Are we going all the way around?

1:31:05.727 --> 1:31:07.494
Just to the island and back.

1:31:07.496 --> 1:31:08.895
At least I'm
starting to feel warm.

1:31:08.897 --> 1:31:10.030
Me too.

1:31:13.035 --> 1:31:15.869
Have you ever thought about what it
would've been like if you'd stayed in London?

1:31:15.871 --> 1:31:17.404
Yeah, all the time.

1:31:18.607 --> 1:31:20.106
Why don't you come back with me?

1:31:20.108 --> 1:31:21.775
My life's here.

1:31:22.978 --> 1:31:25.345
What if I moved here and we got
a place together?

1:31:26.281 --> 1:31:27.280
What? You and me?

1:31:27.282 --> 1:31:28.582
Yeah, like an investment.

1:31:28.584 --> 1:31:30.350
Where am I gonna get all this
money?

1:31:30.352 --> 1:31:32.285
I'm talking about us starting
over.

1:31:32.287 --> 1:31:34.020
I don't need to start over.

1:31:34.756 --> 1:31:36.456
Why are you being weird?

1:31:40.028 --> 1:31:42.596
I have to tell you something and
I don't want you to freak out.

1:31:42.598 --> 1:31:43.897
Why would I freak out?

1:31:43.899 --> 1:31:44.865
It's about Dylan.

1:31:44.867 --> 1:31:45.932
Okay.

1:31:45.934 --> 1:31:47.534
Don't get angry.

1:31:47.536 --> 1:31:48.802
I'm not angry.

1:31:51.106 --> 1:31:53.673
It's gonna make you really
upset.

1:32:07.823 --> 1:32:11.191
I know how much you love
him, and how much he means to you.

1:32:11.193 --> 1:32:13.527
I admire how loyal you are to
him.

1:32:17.833 --> 1:32:21.735
He seems like he's really sweet
and compassionate.

1:32:21.737 --> 1:32:26.673
Like, he's got all of these
emotions that he just can't control.

1:32:26.675 --> 1:32:29.009
What are you doing right now?

1:32:29.011 --> 1:32:33.513
Did you know that when we were kids
he used to pull the wings off flies?

1:32:33.515 --> 1:32:35.515
That's a stupid thing to say.

1:32:35.517 --> 1:32:36.683
It's the truth.

1:32:36.685 --> 1:32:38.051
What's your point?

1:32:40.656 --> 1:32:42.489
I'm trying to tell you something-

1:32:43.258 --> 1:32:45.091
Tell me what?

1:32:47.296 --> 1:32:50.764
Last night, by the fire, at some
point I fell asleep.

1:32:50.766 --> 1:32:53.667
And when I woke up -

1:32:56.004 --> 1:32:57.637
I didn't know what was
happening.

1:32:57.639 --> 1:32:59.406
What did you do?

1:33:00.709 --> 1:33:02.108
I didn't do anything.

1:33:02.644 --> 1:33:04.177
Don't do this.

1:33:05.681 --> 1:33:07.447
I was unconscious.

1:33:08.350 --> 1:33:09.849
He was on top of me -

1:33:09.851 --> 1:33:11.051
Don't.

1:33:11.053 --> 1:33:13.053
I didn't realize what was
happening -

1:33:13.055 --> 1:33:14.054
Stop.

1:33:14.056 --> 1:33:15.555
He wouldn't listen to me Greta-

1:33:15.557 --> 1:33:16.556
Don't.

1:33:16.558 --> 1:33:18.124
Miriam stop.

1:33:29.871 --> 1:33:31.905
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1:33:34.843 --> 1:33:38.211
Please listen to me -

1:33:38.213 --> 1:33:42.782
He's been nothing but kind to
you, and whatever happened it wasn't this.

1:33:45.821 --> 1:33:47.387
You fucked up.

1:33:47.389 --> 1:33:49.556
And you can't even own up to it.

1:33:51.426 --> 1:33:53.994
It's pathetic, and fucking
disgusting.

1:34:03.505 --> 1:34:05.639
Miriam! Miriam!

1:34:07.309 --> 1:34:08.775
Miriam!

1:34:14.182 --> 1:34:15.649
Miriam!

1:34:54.923 --> 1:34:57.424
And it doesn't put
you guys off your appetite?

1:34:57.426 --> 1:34:59.659
No I think it's good to know the whole
process, otherwise you take this stuff for granted.

1:34:59.661 --> 1:35:04.397
There was this point where I thought, if I eat meat
I should be able to do the whole thing, y'know?

1:35:04.399 --> 1:35:06.366
I don't think
I could stomach it.

1:35:07.803 --> 1:35:09.436
There you are.

1:35:10.972 --> 1:35:13.006
I didn't know your sister was
such a badass with a knife.

1:35:13.008 --> 1:35:14.541
Oh, she's just trying to impress
you.

1:35:14.543 --> 1:35:18.545
I think it's cool. What chick
knows how to skin a rabbit?

1:35:18.547 --> 1:35:21.548
I actually find
it incredibly rewarding.

1:35:21.550 --> 1:35:23.850
It's helped me develop as a
person actually.

1:35:23.852 --> 1:35:25.485
Has it, actually?

1:35:26.254 --> 1:35:27.353
Yeah.

1:35:27.355 --> 1:35:28.888
Keep the little shoes.

1:35:32.728 --> 1:35:35.361
Your breath smells like a
raccoon shat in your mouth.

1:35:35.964 --> 1:35:37.230
That's so cold.

1:35:37.232 --> 1:35:38.531
Haven't showered yet.

1:35:38.533 --> 1:35:40.633
Did you sleep by the fire?

1:35:40.635 --> 1:35:42.702
No. Crashed on the couch.

1:35:44.339 --> 1:35:46.206
Next time wake me.

1:35:50.979 --> 1:35:52.579
So what have you learned?

1:35:52.581 --> 1:35:53.613
What?

1:35:53.615 --> 1:35:56.716
You said that it's helped you
develop as a person.

1:35:56.718 --> 1:35:59.652
Yeah. I think it builds
character.

1:35:59.654 --> 1:36:01.321
What have you learned about your
character?

1:36:01.323 --> 1:36:02.288
That I'm capable.

1:36:02.290 --> 1:36:04.624
Of cruelty?

1:36:04.626 --> 1:36:09.329
The first time I did this I was only half
way through when I thought I was gonna throw up -

1:36:09.331 --> 1:36:12.732
but I forced myself to keep
going.

1:36:12.734 --> 1:36:15.869
'Cause I've always relied on other
people for this kind of thing, y'know,

1:36:15.871 --> 1:36:17.704
the stuff I didn't wanna do.

1:36:17.706 --> 1:36:22.408
And then something happened midway
through, and, I had to face myself.

1:36:22.410 --> 1:36:24.744
And you realized how much of a
fucking coward you were?

1:36:24.746 --> 1:36:25.879
Hey!

1:36:25.881 --> 1:36:27.080
What?

1:36:29.117 --> 1:36:31.851
It's empowering knowing you don't
need anyone to look after you.

1:36:32.621 --> 1:36:33.720
I'm proud of you.

1:36:33.722 --> 1:36:35.221
Thanks Binky.

1:36:37.325 --> 1:36:39.225
Have you guys read that
book, um, "My Side of the Mountain?"

1:36:39.227 --> 1:36:42.529
Why are you being
such a fake fuck right now?

1:36:42.531 --> 1:36:44.497
You're acting like she's your
best friend.

1:36:44.499 --> 1:36:45.765
We're just trying
to have a good time, Miriam.

1:36:45.767 --> 1:36:47.567
You don't even like them.

1:36:47.569 --> 1:36:49.435
Don't be a dick, okay,
I know you're in a mood right now -

1:36:49.437 --> 1:36:50.870
What was it
that you said in the car?

1:36:50.872 --> 1:36:53.039
- This is embarassing.
You know that, right?

1:36:53.041 --> 1:36:55.341
that she's a self-centred little brat
who always has to have things her own way.

1:36:55.343 --> 1:36:56.976
You took what
I said out of context.

1:36:56.978 --> 1:36:59.612
No, no, no I wanna hear
you defend yourself - go on.

1:36:59.614 --> 1:37:06.019
I'm not doing this with you.
I'm not doing this.

1:37:20.902 --> 1:37:22.302
Do you wanna do the honours?

1:37:23.205 --> 1:37:24.270
Yeah.

1:40:56.651 --> 1:40:57.817
So, did I live?

1:40:57.819 --> 1:40:58.885
What?

1:41:00.889 --> 1:41:02.855
In your dream

1:41:04.292 --> 1:41:05.958
did I survive?

1:41:11.866 --> 1:41:15.368
You were coughing and I was in
the next room

1:41:15.370 --> 1:41:18.571
and for a while I didn't do
anything.

1:41:18.573 --> 1:41:22.809
And I realized something must be
wrong so...

1:41:22.811 --> 1:41:25.745
I walked into the room where you
were hanging yourself

1:41:27.615 --> 1:41:29.615
and I saw you.

1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:34.020
And I felt like...

1:41:37.358 --> 1:41:41.427
Why didn't I come in earlier,
why did I just sit in the other room?

1:41:41.429 --> 1:41:44.297
When those moments could have
made the difference.

1:41:46.134 --> 1:41:48.534
And your face was all red but...

1:41:48.536 --> 1:41:51.838
you were still breathing, and I
ran over to you

1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.275
and tried to get you down. But I couldn't lift
you and take the belt off at the same time.

1:41:57.011 --> 1:41:59.245
so I just tried to hold you up.

1:42:00.982 --> 1:42:03.950
I couldn't stop thinking how

1:42:03.952 --> 1:42:09.255
I didn't want your last thing that you
experienced in the world to be me panicking.

1:42:11.126 --> 1:42:14.594
I wanted it to be of someone
that really loved you.

1:42:22.804 --> 1:42:27.807
And I kept just saying "it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay"

1:42:31.913 --> 1:42:36.182
and I was holding you,
and just saying that it's gonna be okay,

1:42:36.184 --> 1:42:38.518
and I knew it wasn't gonna be
okay.

1:42:43.291 --> 1:42:45.091
Then I woke up.

1:42:49.297 --> 1:42:51.130
I love you.
