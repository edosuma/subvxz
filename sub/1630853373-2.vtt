38:24.603 --> 38:26.036
[rip on intercom]
<i> let's just start setting.</i>

38:26.104 --> 38:27.404
[deckhand] roger.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.709
[narrator] <i> with atka a no-go</i>
<i> rip turns his bow</i>

38:32.711 --> 38:35.512
<i> for the 260 mile steam</i>
<i> to dutch harbor,</i>

38:35.514 --> 38:39.115
<i> still 16 hours out</i>
<i> from a coast guard</i>
<i> rescue chopper,</i>

38:39.117 --> 38:41.718
<i> if they're able to fly</i>
<i> in the storm.</i>

38:42.721 --> 38:45.955
All right, francis.
We gotta go set.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.991
You take this one off, buddy.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.026
We'll put a sad face next
to your name.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.363
[rip] <i> I talked</i>
<i> to the coast guard.</i>

38:54.333 --> 38:56.333
Now we're making our speed
to dutch harbor.

38:56.401 --> 39:00.303
We're clearing the deck
so we can get
within 100 miles.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.205
<i> They're gonna bring</i>
<i> a halo out.</i>

39:04.943 --> 39:06.109
[radio static]

39:06.111 --> 39:07.310
go ahead, if you're ready.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.048
[indistinct shouting]

39:12.050 --> 39:14.417
come on, everybody, let's go!
Let's go!

39:20.525 --> 39:23.526
[rip] <i> we're all still</i>
<i> a bit in shock.</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:25.962
I mean, if I thought there
was any chance

39:26.031 --> 39:29.032
of anybody getting hurt,
I wouldn't have sat.

39:29.034 --> 39:33.336
<i> But I'm the captain</i>
<i> and it falls on me.</i>

39:33.405 --> 39:37.440
[johnathan on intercom]
<i> okay, guys,</i>
<i> flood the deck out.</i>

39:37.509 --> 39:39.609
I'm not the kind of guy
that runs and hides

39:39.611 --> 39:42.112
but the island's
right there, so...

39:43.115 --> 39:44.948
<i> That's what we gotta do.</i>

39:46.318 --> 39:49.219
[sig] <i> any captain</i>
<i> of any fishing boat</i>
<i> will tell you,</i>

39:49.221 --> 39:52.822
<i> we'll do whatever it takes</i>
<i> to keep going.</i>

39:52.824 --> 39:54.324
<i> Whatever it takes.</i>

39:56.862 --> 39:59.062
[phone ringing]

39:59.965 --> 40:01.331
[bill] hello.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.333
[sig on phone]

40:03.402 --> 40:05.301
sig, what's going on?

40:05.303 --> 40:08.705
I gotta tell you,
there might be
some opportunity my way.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.108
[rip] <i> you gotta</i>
<i> do the best job you can.</i>

40:12.110 --> 40:15.311
My best job is to get
this boat to a safe spot

40:15.313 --> 40:17.313
for the coast guard
to get francis off,

40:18.517 --> 40:20.617
<i> which is not gonna be easy.</i>

40:21.787 --> 40:24.053
[coast guard on radio]

40:34.566 --> 40:40.537
all right, believe me.
There is no quit in this crew,
or this boat, or in me.

[coast guard on radio]

40:53.418 --> 40:56.219

40:56.221 --> 40:58.922
[coast guard on radio]
<i> there's just a lot of water</i>
<i> on the deck.</i>

40:58.924 --> 41:00.557
Whoo!

41:00.658 --> 41:02.325
Wow, this is crazy.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.060
<i> Whoa.</i>

41:04.129 --> 41:06.329
-[johnathan]
watch your fingers!
-Head's up, heads up!

41:06.331 --> 41:08.531
You can't throw
the anchor like that!

41:08.533 --> 41:09.699
[deckhand] watch out!

41:11.002 --> 41:12.602
[sig] oh, my god.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.937
Galley's full of water.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.807
[coast guard on radio]

41:18.610 --> 41:20.643
they left.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.512
I don't know
if they're gonna be able
to save him.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.447
