WEBVTT

00:01.587 --> 00:03.072
<i>Previously on "The Company You Keep..."</i>

00:03.210 --> 00:04.383
How long have you been sober?

00:04.521 --> 00:07.973
Two years,
three weeks, one day.

00:08.111 --> 00:10.217
Why did you leave
the way you did?

00:10.355 --> 00:12.081
Maybe you should ask
your father about that.

00:15.325 --> 00:17.741
Connor's in the air in two
hours, which is why I figured

00:17.879 --> 00:19.260
we'd follow him to the airport.

00:19.398 --> 00:23.437
If I feel any hint of your
investigation continuing,

00:23.575 --> 00:26.785
I will expose your family
for the frauds you really are.

00:26.923 --> 00:28.580
If you come work
for me as my asset,

00:28.718 --> 00:31.065
I'll protect your family while
you help me protect mine.

00:31.203 --> 00:33.481
This Aaron Blenner painting
was recently purchased

00:33.619 --> 00:36.139
<i>by a man named
Grigory Abramoff.</i>

00:36.277 --> 00:38.107
<i>I want it.</i>

00:38.245 --> 00:39.556
Painting's in the truck.

00:39.694 --> 00:42.904
That is the location
of $2 million

00:43.043 --> 00:45.252
worth of unregistered firearms.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.150
This guy right here
is Brad Wilford.

00:47.288 --> 00:49.221
Daphne wants in
on the gun trade.

00:49.359 --> 00:51.223
You want the Maguire throne.

00:51.361 --> 00:54.985
I help you get it,
you and I are truly square.

01:01.026 --> 01:02.269
A little to the left.

01:02.407 --> 01:04.650
No, Seamus, your left.

01:04.788 --> 01:06.445
You're doing great work, Seamus.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.206
You called?

01:08.344 --> 01:11.657
I want your help delivering
that painting to Brad Wilford.

01:14.695 --> 01:17.629
You want me to return the
painting that we just stole?

01:17.767 --> 01:20.977
Well, you said you wanted
to prove your worth, Charlie.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.152
Call UPS.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.015
Or better yet,
have Seamus do it.

01:25.154 --> 01:26.465
Ouch.

01:26.603 --> 01:28.157
It's above his pay grade.

01:30.055 --> 01:33.300
What I need is an invitation
to Pine Grove.

01:34.577 --> 01:36.165
What's Pine Grove?

01:36.303 --> 01:38.546
The Davos
of the defense industry,

01:38.684 --> 01:41.998
an ultra-exclusive conference
where the 1% of the 1%

01:42.136 --> 01:45.001
set the national security
agenda behind closed doors.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.107
Jesus, can't rich
people get normal hobbies

01:47.245 --> 01:48.832
like the rest of us?

01:48.970 --> 01:51.283
Why does Daphne
want to go to Pine Grove?

01:51.421 --> 01:54.286
Brad Wilford will be
a featured speaker there.

01:54.424 --> 01:57.151
I want to convince him
to sell his weapons to me.

01:57.289 --> 01:59.049
But I need Brad to see me
as a businesswoman,

01:59.188 --> 02:00.706
not just another criminal.

02:00.844 --> 02:02.881
I need to get my asset
into Pine Grove.

02:03.019 --> 02:03.882
You turned an asset?

02:04.020 --> 02:05.228
Who?

02:05.366 --> 02:07.334
For their safety,
it's need-to-know.

02:07.472 --> 02:09.543
Now, this requires
a light touch.

02:09.681 --> 02:12.166
If Daphne suspects anything,
she'll cut them out.

02:12.304 --> 02:14.168
This guest list
is a who's who of D.C.

02:14.306 --> 02:15.756
They're all on
a first-name basis.

02:15.894 --> 02:18.724
How do you plan to
infiltrate a place like that?

02:18.862 --> 02:20.657
With a cover you can't vet.

02:20.795 --> 02:22.349
Your name is Brook Stern Jr.

02:22.487 --> 02:24.213
You're retired from
the government and now

02:24.351 --> 02:26.076
consult for a weapons manufacturer,

02:26.215 --> 02:29.045
which is
a universal code for ex-CIA.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.496
You realize you're asking
me to help a drug cartel

02:31.634 --> 02:33.049
get into weapons trafficking?

02:33.187 --> 02:34.671
The ends justify the means.

02:34.809 --> 02:37.605
Is that how the CIA justifies
the secret assassinations

02:37.743 --> 02:38.848
and regime changes?

02:39.883 --> 02:41.609
Let's run it back.

02:41.747 --> 02:43.853
Half the attendees
will be from the intelligence

02:43.991 --> 02:46.925
community, so your asset better
have their cover down pat.

02:47.063 --> 02:51.412
Brook Stern Jr.,
Yale, class of 2003.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.517
I was in Panama.

02:52.655 --> 02:53.863
<i>Cómo estás usted?</i>

02:54.001 --> 02:55.451
<i>Soy Brook Stern.</i>

02:55.589 --> 02:56.866
<i>Bien.</i>

02:57.004 --> 02:58.764
Hey, you ever seen
a Moldovan catfish?

02:58.902 --> 03:00.145
I pulled one out of the Prut.

03:00.283 --> 03:02.975
It was the size
of a golden retriever.

03:03.113 --> 03:04.874
- Favorite restaurant?
- La Sarkis.

03:05.012 --> 03:05.944
Everyone gets the scallops.

03:06.082 --> 03:07.704
both: It's a thing.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.811
Skeleton Key,
Yale's infamous secret society.

03:10.949 --> 03:13.434
Any member will recognize it.

03:13.572 --> 03:18.301
Your objective is to figure out
the details of Daphne's plan--

03:18.439 --> 03:19.785
her arrangement
with Brad Wilford,

03:19.923 --> 03:21.994
and how and where
she's moving arms.

03:22.132 --> 03:24.204
Security at Pine Grove
is intense.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.240
Anti-surveillance measures
in place.

03:26.378 --> 03:29.070
I want you to wear these
at all times.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.106
I'll be listening in.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.592
So that's it?

03:33.730 --> 03:36.008
Meaning what?

03:36.146 --> 03:38.977
Well, last week,
you said you loved me.

03:39.115 --> 03:40.289
Last week,
you were a bartender.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.946
I'm still a bartender.

04:01.137 --> 04:05.348
<i>♪ Give me shelter
from the rain ♪</i>

04:06.798 --> 04:08.109
Nice to see you all.

04:09.628 --> 04:11.251

04:13.770 --> 04:15.289

04:15.427 --> 04:16.877
Hey, don't make this
harder than it is.

04:17.015 --> 04:19.224
We're CIA informants, son.

04:19.362 --> 04:21.640
You know what the CIA did
to Lydia's husband?

04:21.778 --> 04:23.193
It was the cops, Mom.

04:23.332 --> 04:24.367
He was an arsonist.

04:24.505 --> 04:26.714
You should have
asked us first.

04:26.852 --> 04:29.372
Look, obviously this
situation is not ideal,

04:29.510 --> 04:31.443
but big picture--
for once, Charlie's love life

04:31.581 --> 04:32.996
may solve our problems.

04:33.134 --> 04:34.481
Thank you.

04:34.619 --> 04:36.655

04:36.793 --> 04:38.485

04:38.623 --> 04:40.487
Sure, Pop.

- Yeah.

04:42.627 --> 04:44.939
See you guys
in a couple days.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.458
So what?

04:46.596 --> 04:48.460
So I'm the bad guy now?

04:48.598 --> 04:50.186
I'm on your side, babe.

04:59.816 --> 05:00.886
You OK?

05:04.027 --> 05:05.063
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:08.860 --> 05:11.897
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

05:17.386 --> 05:19.767
I asked Simon about
the night he left,

05:19.905 --> 05:22.667
and I mean,
it's probably BS, but--

05:24.116 --> 05:25.670
What did he tell you?

05:25.808 --> 05:26.843
Nothing.

05:26.981 --> 05:28.397
He said I should talk to you.

05:31.089 --> 05:32.608
Pop, what don't I know?

05:37.751 --> 05:40.132
I was in town
visiting that weekend.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.619
You were working late
that night bartending

05:43.757 --> 05:46.069
at that place down in Soho.

05:46.207 --> 05:48.417
And, uh, when I got home.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.180
I found Simon passed out,

05:53.318 --> 05:55.251
high out of his mind.

05:59.082 --> 06:00.808
And that's when I heard her.

06:02.603 --> 06:03.604
Ollie.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.643
I found her in the bathtub.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.818
The water was freezing.

06:13.580 --> 06:16.479
Her lips, they--
they were blue.

06:18.239 --> 06:19.655
I got her out of the tub.

06:19.793 --> 06:22.002
I-- I warmed her up.
I put her to bed.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.076
When Simon woke up,
I told him that you'd given him

06:27.214 --> 06:30.182
enough chances and that he
could screw up his own life,

06:30.320 --> 06:32.046
but there was no way that I
was going to let him put you

06:32.184 --> 06:33.807
and Ollie in danger.

06:40.365 --> 06:41.608
She could have drowned.

06:41.746 --> 06:44.093
I know.

06:44.231 --> 06:47.337
So I gave him an ultimatum
to get clean or else.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.339
Or else what?

06:49.478 --> 06:50.651
Or else I'd kill him.

06:52.135 --> 06:55.311
And what, he believed you?

06:55.449 --> 06:56.968
I put a loaded pistol
to his temple,

06:57.106 --> 06:59.488
so yeah, he did.

07:02.698 --> 07:04.009
You should have told me.

07:04.147 --> 07:05.701
Why didn't you tell me?

07:05.839 --> 07:07.427
You would have called him,
and then he would have talked

07:07.565 --> 07:09.152
his way back into your life--

07:09.290 --> 07:11.154
But if I'd known, I wouldn't
have spent the last ten years

07:11.292 --> 07:14.503
wondering why he gave
up on us, on me,

07:14.641 --> 07:16.643
after I gave him chance
after chance.

07:16.781 --> 07:17.989
That's why I did it.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.991
I did what you couldn't.

08:01.653 --> 08:03.931
If someone told me a month
ago that we'd be heading

08:04.069 --> 08:06.278
to a West Virginia
resort together,

08:06.416 --> 08:08.004
I would have said
they're insane.

08:08.142 --> 08:10.282
You're telling me.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.492
I've got to admit,
I'm impressed, Charlie.

08:12.630 --> 08:14.114
Sorry, Brook.

08:15.356 --> 08:16.944
Why don't I have a cover?

08:17.082 --> 08:18.739
You've got two
Ivy League degrees.

08:18.877 --> 08:21.397
You do not need a cover.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.503
And we're business partners?

08:24.365 --> 08:25.297
Yeah.

08:26.229 --> 08:28.059
I'll play along.

08:31.062 --> 08:32.442
<i>♪ Squeaky clean ♪</i>

09:05.855 --> 09:07.098
<i>It's a really nice room.</i>

09:07.236 --> 09:08.927
You guys are living

09:09.065 --> 09:10.411
<i>Speak for yourself.</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:12.344
<i>Since I have to stay
out of Daphne's sight,</i>

09:12.482 --> 09:14.001
<i>my accommodations
are a little more rustic.</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:19.386
So Daphne's meeting
Wilford in 15 minutes.

09:19.524 --> 09:21.250
Stick to her like a shadow.

09:21.388 --> 09:22.665
Aye-aye, captain.

09:30.293 --> 09:31.847
Does Brad know where to meet?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.229
<i>He knows.</i>

09:39.475 --> 09:41.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:41.235 --> 09:42.789
Where do you think
you're going?

09:42.927 --> 09:44.618
Being partners is just a cover.

09:57.044 --> 09:58.528
Daphne Finch.

09:58.667 --> 09:59.564
At last, we meet.

10:02.015 --> 10:04.189
Where's Grigory?

10:04.327 --> 10:08.159
Oh, he's enjoying a one-way
red-eye back to Mother Russia.

10:08.297 --> 10:09.850
Turns out illegal arms dealing

10:09.988 --> 10:12.025
was a violation
of his A-1 visa.

10:12.163 --> 10:13.026
Oops.

10:15.718 --> 10:18.790
So what is this,
some kind of shakedown?

10:18.928 --> 10:20.171
Brad, no.

10:20.309 --> 10:22.276
Come on, have a drink.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.451
Yes, ma'am.

10:24.589 --> 10:27.281
Blackmail is so short-term.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.525
I like to work long-term.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.320
OK, I'm listening.

10:31.458 --> 10:35.220
Your company produces
the M2010 sniper rifle.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.498
With my capital
and shipping routes,

10:37.637 --> 10:40.260
we could move ten times what
Grigory was able to handle.

10:41.710 --> 10:45.921
Uh,
let me break this down.

10:48.130 --> 10:52.513
Um, for every 100 rifles
American Armory makes,

10:52.652 --> 10:54.999
maybe 3 can disappear.

10:55.137 --> 10:59.279
Chalk it up to quality control,
or factory rejects, et cetera.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.178
But any more than that
and people way above me

11:02.316 --> 11:03.628
start asking questions.

11:04.905 --> 11:07.701
Now, I-- I like money,

11:07.839 --> 11:09.358
but I prefer staying out
of prison.

11:13.224 --> 11:14.881
Good luck to you, Ms. Finch.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.750
Every year
thousands of weapons

11:21.888 --> 11:24.097
made for and by
the U.S. of A end up

11:24.235 --> 11:25.615
in the hands of our enemies.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.617
But what if we could stop it?

11:27.756 --> 11:30.034
I have three words for you--

11:30.172 --> 11:34.245
end use monitoring.

11:34.383 --> 11:36.868
With just a slight change
to our existing manufacturing,

11:37.006 --> 11:39.388
<i>we can outfit
our military with weapons</i>

11:39.526 --> 11:40.976
<i>that could be deactivated
if they fall</i>

11:41.114 --> 11:42.287
<i>into the wrong hands.</i>

11:42.425 --> 11:43.599
Any updates?

11:43.737 --> 11:44.704
Nope.

11:44.842 --> 11:46.429
She ditched me.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.810
Get her to open up to you.

11:47.948 --> 11:50.123
You're good at getting
women to trust you.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.644
Yeah.

12:01.479 --> 12:02.998
What can I get you, sir?

12:03.136 --> 12:04.724
Two mojitos, please.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.141
<i>I don't actually
like mojitos.</i>

12:08.279 --> 12:09.763
I was just messing
with your sister.

12:11.903 --> 12:15.389
Excuse me, could we swap
those out for two Negronis?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.908
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:17.046 --> 12:18.668
I love Negronis.

12:18.807 --> 12:19.669
I know.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.746
<i>You know, a great Negroni,
it's all in the orange peel.</i>

12:26.884 --> 12:28.230
<i>- Is that right?
- Yeah.</i>

12:28.368 --> 12:29.783
<i>Hmm.</i>

12:29.921 --> 12:32.096
<i>Of all the gin joints
in the world...</i>

12:32.234 --> 12:34.581
What are you doing here, Hill?

12:34.719 --> 12:36.686
I could ask you the same.

12:36.825 --> 12:39.034
I'm running countersurveillance.

12:39.172 --> 12:40.690
There's a lot
of foreign nationals

12:40.829 --> 12:42.416
who'd love to
infiltrate this place.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.866
Saw the guest list.

12:44.004 --> 12:46.386
We were told to give
Daphne Finch a wide berth.

12:46.524 --> 12:48.319
I assume that's your doing?

12:48.457 --> 12:50.597
I can neither
confirm nor deny.

12:50.735 --> 12:51.874
All right.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.151
You should swing by
for a drink later.

13:07.338 --> 13:09.029
You talked to Leo.

13:11.238 --> 13:12.550
You could have killed her.

13:14.759 --> 13:16.796
You could have killed her,
our daughter.

13:18.867 --> 13:19.868
I know.

13:21.870 --> 13:25.977
Once I came to, once--
once your father told me

13:26.115 --> 13:30.706
what had happened,
told me what I did...

13:35.021 --> 13:36.401
Everything changed for me.

13:38.093 --> 13:39.922
So what, you just--

13:40.060 --> 13:44.409
you just walk away
and never look back?

13:44.547 --> 13:47.067
Leaving was the only way
that I could guarantee that I

13:47.205 --> 13:48.413
could never hurt her again.

13:51.037 --> 13:52.107
Your father was right, Bird.

13:52.245 --> 13:54.626
I didn't deserve you.

13:54.764 --> 13:58.251
If it hadn't been for him,
I would have never left.

13:58.389 --> 14:01.392
You and Ollie were
the best parts of my life.

14:08.778 --> 14:11.540
I spent the last ten years
wondering what was wrong

14:11.678 --> 14:15.716
with me, trying to figure out
what was so awful about me

14:15.855 --> 14:18.754
that you could just
leave us like that.

14:20.929 --> 14:22.413
I am so sorry.

14:26.279 --> 14:28.074
I wish I could have
made that call sooner,

14:28.212 --> 14:33.251
but I had to be damn sure
that I was sober for good

14:33.389 --> 14:36.116
before I could ever even
think about reaching out.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.471
But I want to know
our daughter.

14:50.061 --> 14:54.307
I-- I just want to be some
small part of Ollie's life.

15:07.527 --> 15:10.081
So you going to tell me
what happened with Brad?

15:10.219 --> 15:11.945
I mean, we're here.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.258
It's a no-go.

15:14.396 --> 15:17.192
He can only siphon off a small
number of the M2010 rifles

15:17.330 --> 15:18.987
they produce.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.749
OK. So we help Brad
get more rifles.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.544
OK. And how do we do that?

15:29.756 --> 15:33.484
We create the supply, right?

15:33.622 --> 15:36.763
We figure out how to get the
top brass at American Armory

15:36.901 --> 15:39.662
to discontinue the M2010.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.216
Well, that would give
Brad a surplus

15:41.354 --> 15:42.700
he'd be happy to unload.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.634
But what would make
the CEO of a weapons company

15:45.772 --> 15:48.154
want to stop manufacturing
a profitable weapon?

15:49.707 --> 15:52.054
The key to getting
someone to say yes

15:52.192 --> 15:55.540
is to understand
what it is they want.

15:55.678 --> 15:58.233
<i>People want one
of three things--</i>

15:58.371 --> 16:02.064
<i>money, power, or respect.</i>

16:02.202 --> 16:05.757
Henry Scoals,
CEO of American Armory,

16:05.895 --> 16:08.243
grew up the son of a
truck driver and homemaker

16:08.381 --> 16:10.176
in rural Pennsylvania.

16:10.314 --> 16:13.075
We play to his working-class
roots to butter him up.

16:13.213 --> 16:14.421
Is this seat taken?

16:14.559 --> 16:15.664
I can do that.

16:15.802 --> 16:19.081
A 14-karat gold face mask.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.807
Oh, wow.

16:20.945 --> 16:22.015
Excuse me.

16:22.153 --> 16:24.535
Uh, do people still
drink beer here?

16:24.673 --> 16:26.847
We have a Belgian white,
an imperial stout,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.194
and a seasonal--
- You know what?

16:28.332 --> 16:29.402
Whatever is cheapest.

16:30.610 --> 16:32.060
Make it two.

16:32.198 --> 16:33.923
Then once you
got him talking,

16:34.062 --> 16:36.064
you just drop
the lure in the water.

16:36.202 --> 16:38.790
Cheers, Henry.

16:38.928 --> 16:41.828
As a kid, did you always
dream of running the world's

16:41.966 --> 16:43.278
biggest gun manufacturer?

16:43.416 --> 16:45.211
Hell, no.

16:45.349 --> 16:47.592
I wanted to build
colonies on Mars.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.180
All right.

16:49.318 --> 16:50.975
But when you grew up
clipping coupons,

16:51.113 --> 16:53.184
it's hard to say no
to the biggest paycheck.

16:53.322 --> 16:55.152
A science geek at heart.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.257
You ever think of investing
in new gun technology?

16:57.913 --> 16:59.225
No.

16:59.363 --> 17:02.090
As much as I'd love to,
arms manufacturing

17:02.228 --> 17:04.161
is all about risk mitigation.

17:04.299 --> 17:05.955
It's always about
the bottom line, isn't it?

17:06.094 --> 17:07.440
That's the truth.

17:09.235 --> 17:10.960
<i>So it's money
that drives him.</i>

17:20.073 --> 17:22.558
Scoals is open to
pivoting his production line.

17:22.696 --> 17:25.009
He's just not comfortable
taking the financial risk.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.942
So we take the decision
out of his hands,

17:27.080 --> 17:28.323
get someone else
to foot the bill.

17:31.878 --> 17:33.155
We need him.

17:34.984 --> 17:37.297
Congressman Eisenberg, chair
of the defense subcommittee

17:37.435 --> 17:38.747
for appropriations.

17:38.885 --> 17:40.438
They determine
the DOD's budget.

17:40.576 --> 17:42.578
Get the DOD to open
their purse strings.

17:42.716 --> 17:45.133
Yeah, well, good luck
getting five minutes with him.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.996
This is a room full
of defense contractors.

17:47.135 --> 17:48.619
He's basically prom king.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.348
Not him.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.004
The husband.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.456
Come on.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.544
Sorry about that. Sorry.

18:17.682 --> 18:20.478
Hey, you, uh-- you've got
to swing from the shoulder.

18:20.616 --> 18:21.721
Theo's been telling me that
for years.

18:21.859 --> 18:22.825
I've been telling him that
for years.

18:22.963 --> 18:23.964
See?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.483
Tennis?
- Pickleball.

18:25.621 --> 18:26.726
Oh.

18:26.864 --> 18:28.314
Oh, we were just
talking about that.

18:28.452 --> 18:29.936
Doubles?
Tomorrow?

18:30.074 --> 18:31.213
Ah.
Come on.

18:31.351 --> 18:32.490
All right.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.009
Uh, how's 10:00?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.700
- Sounds great.
- See you there.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.670
<i>No one runs for Congress
for the money.</i>

18:39.808 --> 18:41.292
No, he wants respect.

18:43.846 --> 18:46.815
So defense appropriation.

18:46.953 --> 18:47.885
Were you military?

18:48.023 --> 18:49.162
Oh, no.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.474
Don't tell anyone.

18:50.612 --> 18:51.992
He's a pacifist.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.718
I offer a balanced perspective.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.689
It's like, how many
weapons do we need?

18:58.827 --> 19:00.898
The more we make, the more
wars pop up all over the globe.

19:01.036 --> 19:02.348
OK.

19:02.486 --> 19:04.246
So what about end use
monitoring weapons?

19:04.384 --> 19:05.351
Remote control guns?

19:05.489 --> 19:06.697
I've heard of them.

19:08.354 --> 19:09.734
Oh!

19:09.872 --> 19:11.529
I mean, it could
slow down conflicts

19:11.667 --> 19:12.910
armed with illegal weapons.

19:13.048 --> 19:15.361
Well, change doesn't
happen overnight.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.122
No, but it does start
with proper funding.

19:18.260 --> 19:21.021
Even if hypothetically
I support the concept,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.921
I don't have that kind of
political capital to spend.

19:24.059 --> 19:26.406
Well, there's no
oversight on earmarks.

19:26.544 --> 19:27.511
What?

19:27.649 --> 19:28.443
It's true.

19:29.237 --> 19:30.928
10, 5, 2.

19:31.584 --> 19:32.619
Oh!

19:32.757 --> 19:34.207
That's game.

19:34.345 --> 19:35.691
- Nice game.
- Good game.

19:35.829 --> 19:36.865
- Good game.
- Thanks.

19:37.003 --> 19:38.280
- Good job.
- I see it now.

19:38.418 --> 19:40.455
You're going to be the new
face of modern warfare.

19:40.593 --> 19:42.353
You could be the
Jimmy Carter of the

19:42.491 --> 19:43.596
military industrial complex.

19:43.734 --> 19:44.631
Go down in history.

19:44.769 --> 19:46.426
- Indeed.
- Thanks, guys.

19:46.564 --> 19:48.704
- Good game.
- Yeah.

19:48.842 --> 19:50.396
Yeah, so subcommittee
meets next week.

19:50.534 --> 19:51.535
We will see what we can do.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.090
We got him.

19:57.575 --> 20:00.785
So your father told me
about your fight.

20:01.614 --> 20:03.650
Fight?

20:03.788 --> 20:05.790
Pop screwed up,
and I called him on it.

20:05.928 --> 20:07.758
Yeah, that's what your
father calls a fight.

20:10.623 --> 20:12.625
Look, I get that he was
just trying to protect us.

20:12.763 --> 20:15.455
But, you know,
he had no right to keep it

20:15.593 --> 20:16.732
from me all these years.

20:16.870 --> 20:17.975
He should have told me.

20:19.632 --> 20:21.289
Oh, damn it.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.635
Here, let me do that.

20:27.778 --> 20:31.091
You know, when your dad
got back from New York,

20:31.230 --> 20:34.267
we talked a lot about
what to do, OK?

20:34.405 --> 20:37.270
But I got to tell you,
Bird, I was really happy

20:37.408 --> 20:38.823
when he sent Simon packing.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.413
You know, it was a clean break.

20:42.551 --> 20:46.417
And we could spare you the pain
of knowing

20:46.555 --> 20:48.695
what almost happened
that night.

20:48.833 --> 20:53.044
I know,
but sometimes the stories

20:53.182 --> 20:55.357
that we tell ourselves
to fill in the cracks

20:55.495 --> 20:59.085
of what happened are, you know,
they--

20:59.223 --> 21:00.983
they hurt worse than the truth.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.053
Yeah.

21:03.503 --> 21:05.540
We thought we were
protecting you, but--

21:07.990 --> 21:09.785
of course,
you wouldn't know anything

21:09.923 --> 21:11.304
about keeping
your kid in the dark

21:11.442 --> 21:13.548
in order to protect them, right?

21:13.686 --> 21:16.723
So what do you think?

21:18.829 --> 21:21.349
I think you are
conniving and manipulative.

21:21.487 --> 21:22.833
I meant about the nails.

21:29.909 --> 21:31.980
You think it's optimism
or masochism that

21:32.118 --> 21:34.500
led us into this line of work?

21:34.638 --> 21:38.538
Actually, I used to think
that the job found me...

21:38.676 --> 21:43.336
That my particular brand of
idealism, duty, and rebellion

21:43.474 --> 21:46.581
somehow made me
the perfect recruit.

21:46.719 --> 21:48.721
"The Company"
definitely has a type.

21:50.723 --> 21:51.862
Now what do you think?

21:53.967 --> 21:56.418
I think I liked the idea
that there was right and wrong,

21:56.556 --> 21:57.419
good and evil.

21:59.387 --> 22:01.389
It's a comforting idea.

22:01.527 --> 22:03.839
If we're chasing
down the bad guys,

22:03.977 --> 22:05.324
then we must be
the good guys, right?

22:07.912 --> 22:09.604
But what if they're only
the bad guys because

22:09.742 --> 22:10.674
we're chasing them?

22:23.549 --> 22:27.760
So Scoals is ready
to make the weapon.

22:27.898 --> 22:29.486
Congress is going to
show up with the cash.

22:29.624 --> 22:31.729
All we got to do is get
the Department of Defense

22:31.867 --> 22:35.802
to award a contract to American
Armory to produce a rifle,

22:35.940 --> 22:37.528
and we're set.

22:37.666 --> 22:39.081
The under secretary
of defense

22:39.219 --> 22:40.876
was my professor at Columbia.

22:41.014 --> 22:42.153
No kidding.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.604
No kidding.
He loved me.

22:44.742 --> 22:48.539
<i>And he happens to be speaking
tomorrow in the Oak Room.</i>

22:48.677 --> 22:49.920
<i>I'll invite him to dinner,</i>

22:50.058 --> 22:52.336
convince him how necessary

22:52.474 --> 22:55.235
end use tracking weapons
are to the future of

22:55.374 --> 22:56.651
American military supremacy.

22:59.826 --> 23:02.415
To getting you what you want.

23:02.553 --> 23:04.831
I'm just glad somebody
finally gets it.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.319
<i>So how did you get
into our line of work?</i>

23:10.458 --> 23:14.945
Two generations of my family
tailored suits for wiseguys.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.118
Collar Bar.

23:16.256 --> 23:17.292
That's where we got the name.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.052
It was my grandfather's shop.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.157
- OK.
- Yeah.

23:20.295 --> 23:21.676
And your dad?

23:21.814 --> 23:25.334
Steelworker till '95.

23:25.473 --> 23:27.820
The job dried up,
pension along with it.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.856
- Oh, that's rough.
- Yeah.

23:29.994 --> 23:31.133
They needed money.

23:31.271 --> 23:34.205
And grifting
just kind of fit perfect.

23:34.343 --> 23:37.312
I mean, the way he saw it,
so long as the guy above him

23:37.450 --> 23:39.797
was cheating him
out of what was his,

23:39.935 --> 23:41.972
it's only fair to do
the same right back.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.353
<i>I get that.</i>

23:48.979 --> 23:50.636
You know, this is about
the most committed

23:50.774 --> 23:52.189
relationship I've ever had.

23:53.570 --> 23:55.468
No boyfriend?

23:55.606 --> 23:57.401
<i>It's kind of tough
in our line of work, no?</i>

23:58.644 --> 23:59.955
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:00.093 --> 24:02.302
<i>What about you?</i>

24:02.441 --> 24:03.683
Yeah, I was seeing someone.

24:04.891 --> 24:05.823
Got bored?

24:05.961 --> 24:07.307
No.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.033
No, she broke my heart.

24:17.732 --> 24:22.461
So money, power, respect.

24:24.324 --> 24:25.912
Which one are you going for?

24:29.709 --> 24:30.745
Nice try, Charlie.

24:32.781 --> 24:34.127
But I'm not the mark.

25:46.130 --> 25:50.307
The Green Revolution is being
throttled by access to cobalt.

25:50.445 --> 25:53.275
75% of cobalt
is stuck in high-conflict

25:53.413 --> 25:54.967
regions like the Congo.

25:55.105 --> 25:57.417
The future depends
on resolution

25:57.556 --> 26:00.110
and empowering
these individual states.

26:00.248 --> 26:01.974
Thank you,
Under Secretary Bridges.

26:07.945 --> 26:10.154
Mr. Bridges,
so good to see you again.

26:10.983 --> 26:11.949
Do I know you?

26:12.087 --> 26:13.330
Daphne Finch.

26:13.468 --> 26:15.194
I was in your global
collaboration seminar

26:15.332 --> 26:17.127
at Columbia, class of '09.

26:17.265 --> 26:18.507
Lucky you.

26:20.509 --> 26:22.857
Always good to see a Bonesman
who still respects the pin.

26:22.995 --> 26:24.444
Brook Stern.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.514
First time in Pine Grove?

26:25.653 --> 26:27.309
It is.

26:27.447 --> 26:29.173
I'll make sure you get an
invitation to tonight's event.

26:29.311 --> 26:30.796
Great.

26:30.934 --> 26:32.176
Nice to see you again.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.043
I worked my ass off.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.528
Published a paper on
biotech in the Global South

26:39.667 --> 26:41.427
that that man called
game-changing.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.740
But me, he doesn't remember.

26:43.878 --> 26:47.813
It's you, pale, male, and fake
Yale that gets the respect.

26:49.504 --> 26:50.470
Is it fair?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.300
No.

26:52.438 --> 26:55.614
It'd be disappointing if it
wasn't so utterly predictable.

26:56.373 --> 26:57.961
Maybe.

26:58.099 --> 27:01.620
Not feeling like you belong.
I get that.

27:11.284 --> 27:12.596
Growing up, my--

27:12.734 --> 27:17.497
my mom took a second job
as a janitor, night shift.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.500
And when our neighbor
couldn't look after me,

27:20.639 --> 27:23.055
<i>she used to wake me up
and take me with her.</i>

27:23.193 --> 27:26.506
One of my first memories
is lying on this blanket

27:26.645 --> 27:30.027
on the floor of this fancy
office building bathroom

27:30.165 --> 27:32.236
watching my mom scrub toilets.

27:36.862 --> 27:40.728
It's humbling
watching our parents

27:40.866 --> 27:42.833
go through tough moments,
isn't it?

27:46.423 --> 27:48.839
You know,
right now with my dad--

27:48.977 --> 27:50.772
he's got dementia.

27:53.741 --> 27:54.914
I'm sorry.

27:55.052 --> 27:56.019
Mm.

27:58.504 --> 27:59.919
I was finishing
my undergrad when

28:00.057 --> 28:01.265
she told me she had cancer.

28:03.198 --> 28:04.890
I deferred a year.

28:05.028 --> 28:07.962
<i>Doctors had a treatment plan,
and maybe--</i>

28:08.100 --> 28:09.895
<i>maybe it might have worked
if she'd been able to afford</i>

28:10.033 --> 28:11.724
<i>health insurance.</i>

28:11.862 --> 28:14.037
I thought if I was there
I could do something,

28:14.175 --> 28:16.695
but it didn't matter.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.213
I just watched her waste away.

28:21.009 --> 28:22.390
She didn't see me graduate.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.739
I really wish I could
have given her that.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.467
I'm sure she would
have been proud.

28:32.918 --> 28:34.920
Patrick showed up
at the funeral,

28:35.058 --> 28:38.820
<i>told me he was my dad,
offered to pay for my MBA.</i>

28:41.961 --> 28:45.378
I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

28:48.140 --> 28:49.210
Mr. Stern?

28:54.802 --> 28:57.080
You asked me
what I want, Charlie--

28:57.218 --> 29:01.015
money, power, or respect.

29:03.327 --> 29:04.570
I want it all.

29:12.129 --> 29:13.096
Let's go get it.

29:29.491 --> 29:31.355
Meeting with an asset
in the field.

29:31.493 --> 29:33.702
That is a risky move,
Officer Hill.

29:33.841 --> 29:36.050
We need to talk.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.052
The man you're meeting
tonight, Dalton Bridges--

29:39.156 --> 29:40.848
he's ex-CIA.

29:40.986 --> 29:42.677
So if there are any weak
spots in your cover,

29:42.815 --> 29:43.712
he's going to know.

29:45.887 --> 29:47.371
Anything you can tell me
about him?

29:48.441 --> 29:50.029
That he's a Boy Scout?

29:51.686 --> 29:54.758
Look, that's not really
useful information.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.865
You'll figure something out.

30:00.350 --> 30:01.351
OK.

30:01.489 --> 30:02.386
OK.

30:05.044 --> 30:05.907
Hey.

30:07.564 --> 30:11.050
That story you told Daphne
about your parents--

30:11.188 --> 30:15.020
was it true or just a way
to get her to talk?

30:15.158 --> 30:16.159
Both.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.542
You know,
there's a lot of things

30:20.680 --> 30:22.855
I've wanted to tell you too.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.755
Me too.

30:32.037 --> 30:33.314
Hmm.

30:44.704 --> 30:45.878
Ugh.

30:46.016 --> 30:47.638
Guess our comms
got too close.

30:48.812 --> 30:49.744
Yeah.

30:51.504 --> 30:53.127
Be careful, Charlie.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.785
I'll do my best.

31:05.553 --> 31:06.795
Diaz, get in here.

31:11.110 --> 31:12.456
Better be important.

31:12.594 --> 31:13.561
Someone is
running surveillance

31:13.699 --> 31:15.149
at the conference.

31:15.287 --> 31:16.978
We've got to
pinpoint the source.

31:17.116 --> 31:18.462
Come on.

32:16.796 --> 32:19.454
Stern, you made it.

32:19.592 --> 32:20.766
Thank you for the invite.

32:20.904 --> 32:22.354
Skip the formalities.

32:23.251 --> 32:24.977
Where were you stationed?

32:25.115 --> 32:26.772
<i>Here we go.</i>

32:26.910 --> 32:27.946
That obvious?

32:28.084 --> 32:29.775
Must be losing my edge.

32:29.913 --> 32:31.501
Panama.

32:31.639 --> 32:32.951
Then a stretch in Moldova.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.470
Interesting.

32:35.608 --> 32:37.438
You a La Sarkis
or an Il Forno's man?

32:37.576 --> 32:39.474
Oh, Il Forno.

32:39.612 --> 32:41.338
I don't trust the seafood
in a landlocked nation.

32:43.651 --> 32:44.652
Smart.

32:44.790 --> 32:45.998
<i>Good.</i>

32:46.136 --> 32:47.137
<i>I've had my moments.</i>

32:48.380 --> 32:49.243
Hey, it's me.

32:52.211 --> 32:53.385
Be right there.

32:57.492 --> 32:58.459
Hey.

32:58.597 --> 33:00.012
What's up?

33:00.150 --> 33:02.221
We picked up an unauthorized
bug at Pine Grove.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.603
That's ballsy.

33:04.741 --> 33:06.329
We have to check everyone.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.365
Hate to ask, but could we
take a look in your room?

33:08.503 --> 33:09.953
Yeah. Come right in.

33:14.302 --> 33:16.408
So any guesses
who it might be?

33:17.719 --> 33:18.582
It's not you, right?

33:19.928 --> 33:21.827
Vik, come on.

33:31.216 --> 33:33.942
- Good?
- All clear.

33:34.081 --> 33:35.392
I just have to give you
a quick once over.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.428
Protocol.

33:36.566 --> 33:37.429
Of course.

33:37.567 --> 33:39.017
Have at it.

33:42.917 --> 33:44.815
All right.
Wish me luck.

33:44.953 --> 33:47.025
They're just the
leaders of the free world.

33:47.163 --> 33:48.233
How bad could it be?

33:49.406 --> 33:50.511
Let's go.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.968
What brings you
to Pine Grove?

34:00.107 --> 34:02.557
Consulting?

34:02.695 --> 34:06.009
My client has me checking out
end use tracking technology.

34:06.147 --> 34:08.805
You know, keep the guns in
the hands of the good guys.

34:08.943 --> 34:10.151
The end of war.

34:10.289 --> 34:11.946
How noble.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.568
I think Wall Street
just lost a few points

34:13.706 --> 34:15.225
hearing us talk about it.

34:16.537 --> 34:18.401
How many more?

34:18.539 --> 34:19.609
We've located the signal.

34:20.886 --> 34:22.060
It's coming from a lodge deep
on the edge of the property.

34:22.198 --> 34:23.440
Rich people.

34:23.578 --> 34:25.339
Let's hope they've still
got their clothes on.

34:30.999 --> 34:33.278
All of these politicians
wringing their hands

34:33.416 --> 34:37.627
on MSNBC about ending
the civil war in the DRC.

34:37.765 --> 34:39.767
I mean, where do they think
the cobalt that powers

34:39.905 --> 34:41.631
their smartphones comes from?

34:41.769 --> 34:43.805
Without the cover
of conflict,

34:43.943 --> 34:45.531
we'd lose all access
to the mines.

34:47.395 --> 34:48.845
Wait.

34:48.983 --> 34:52.607
What happened to "the future
depends on resolution?"

34:54.057 --> 34:56.508
We all know that's just spin.

34:56.646 --> 34:58.579
This is a safe space, Stern.

35:03.170 --> 35:05.862
I've got some contacts
down there

35:06.000 --> 35:08.347
doing some work
to support the war.

35:08.485 --> 35:10.073
I'm listening.

35:10.211 --> 35:12.972
Got the infrastructure,
short on arms.

35:13.111 --> 35:17.045
Now, if things were
to shift to trackable weapons

35:17.184 --> 35:19.807
in your current contracts,
then maybe

35:19.945 --> 35:21.843
some of the existing supply
could end up

35:21.981 --> 35:25.502
in the right hands,
help ensure that conflict

35:25.640 --> 35:27.228
doesn't end any time soon.

35:29.230 --> 35:31.163
So what do I have to do
to make this happen?

35:33.855 --> 35:36.203
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:36.341 --> 35:37.411
FBI.

35:37.549 --> 35:38.826
Everyone, I need you to relax.

35:38.964 --> 35:41.139
We're just here to check IDs.

35:41.277 --> 35:42.726
Come on. Come on. Come on.

35:42.864 --> 35:44.590
I have to check everyone,
ma'am.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.385
Put your arms out
to the side, please.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.181
Are you carrying any weapons?

35:50.907 --> 35:52.943
Pull that out and put it on
the table, please.

35:53.081 --> 35:55.153
- What's your name?
- Brook Stern Jr.

36:15.725 --> 36:16.760
Clear.

36:19.901 --> 36:21.420
You're a lucky man.

36:37.264 --> 36:38.610
Oh, there you are.

36:40.474 --> 36:43.787
Before we got so rudely
interrupted last night,

36:43.925 --> 36:46.411
there was something
you wanted to ask me for?

36:47.929 --> 36:50.104
A DOD contract
for American Armory.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.384
Done.

36:54.522 --> 36:56.593
Send my assistant the details.

36:56.731 --> 36:58.630
I will.

36:58.768 --> 37:01.149
Some of us have to make
the world go round, right?

37:01.288 --> 37:02.599
That we do.

37:02.737 --> 37:03.807
Safe travels.
- You too.

37:03.945 --> 37:04.912
Mm-hmm.

37:12.644 --> 37:13.783
Won't Brad be pleased?

37:16.786 --> 37:18.408
You know, once Connor's
out of the picture,

37:18.546 --> 37:19.823
I'll need someone I can trust.

37:19.961 --> 37:21.446
Flattered,
but I prefer my own bed

37:21.584 --> 37:23.171
to a federal penitentiary.

37:23.310 --> 37:24.759
We just went legit.

37:24.897 --> 37:25.933
Doesn't make it right.

37:26.071 --> 37:27.693
Oh, I forgot.

37:27.831 --> 37:31.145
Saint Charlie,
the Robin Hood of Baltimore.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.872
You know, considering the hole
you just dug yourself out of,

37:34.010 --> 37:36.012
I thought you'd enjoy
a little profit sharing.

37:38.014 --> 37:40.361
Could help your dad buy
a few more comfortable years.

37:58.241 --> 37:59.691
I'm here to pick up Ollie.

38:08.665 --> 38:12.186
Listen, uh,
I just wanted to thank you.

38:13.843 --> 38:14.740
Thank me?

38:16.535 --> 38:18.641
I'm the one who wanted
to shoot you, remember?

38:18.779 --> 38:20.367
Rings a bell.

38:23.266 --> 38:26.821
I'm sorry for all the pain
that I caused.

38:26.959 --> 38:30.066
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for you, so...

38:36.383 --> 38:38.074
Step nine?

38:38.212 --> 38:39.282
That's the one.

38:44.701 --> 38:45.737
OK, then.

38:45.875 --> 38:46.945
You're welcome.

38:50.293 --> 38:53.123
But when you're down at Lucky's
licking your ice cream cone,

38:53.261 --> 38:56.299
I want you to keep
something in mind.

38:56.437 --> 38:59.716
The owner's a regular here,
and if you

38:59.854 --> 39:02.892
so much as smoke
a candy cigarette,

39:03.030 --> 39:04.411
I'll get a call.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.586
Am I clear?

39:09.864 --> 39:10.762
Yeah.

39:49.525 --> 39:50.629
Thanks, Bird.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.329
Did you tell him?

40:02.779 --> 40:04.988
Every word,
just like you said.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.163
Thanks, Pop.

40:10.891 --> 40:12.030
Yeah, it's open.

40:16.966 --> 40:18.346
Your stuff's on the table.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.596
That was, um,
close out there.

40:26.734 --> 40:27.942
Yeah.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.979
You almost blew
your whole operation.

40:31.739 --> 40:34.052
It's a good thing
you had a friend.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.537
You didn't seem
to mind spending

40:36.675 --> 40:38.021
the weekend with Daphne.

40:39.678 --> 40:41.024
At your request.

40:45.788 --> 40:47.410
Hey, when you were
in the woods,

40:47.548 --> 40:49.688
were you out there to save
your operation or save me?

40:55.004 --> 40:56.557
The operation.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.806
Right.

41:09.052 --> 41:10.468
I'll be in touch

41:10.606 --> 41:11.710
when we know our next move.

41:11.848 --> 41:12.746
Yeah, OK.

41:14.368 --> 41:15.369
Hey, Emma.

41:25.034 --> 41:26.414
Your comms.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.316
Right.

41:41.395 --> 41:42.430
Hello?

41:42.569 --> 41:43.431
<i>It's Singh.</i>

41:44.950 --> 41:46.124
Everything OK?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.541
I just got grilled
for six hours.

41:49.679 --> 41:52.406
<i>A lot of questions about
why we came up empty-handed.</i>

41:53.614 --> 41:54.581
What did you say?

41:56.410 --> 41:59.033
<i>Nothing,
but that's the last time.</i>

41:59.171 --> 42:01.519
Whatever it is you're up to,
you're coloring way

42:01.657 --> 42:02.692
outside the lines.

42:02.830 --> 42:04.038
<i>And I don't like being used.</i>

42:04.176 --> 42:06.144
- Vik, I wasn't using you.
<i>- Save it.</i>

42:06.282 --> 42:09.630
I just hope that asset
of yours is worth it.

42:16.982 --> 42:18.087
Me too.
