00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
Don't you stop, mate.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.000
Gimme.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.400
Gimme.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.920
Whoo-hoo!
Been playing poker?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.000
You Air Force pussy boys
wanna play for cash?

02:32.000 --> 02:32.440
You Air Force pussy boys
wanna play for cash?

02:35.640 --> 02:37.640
Fuck!

02:38.560 --> 02:40.000
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.840
I can't even deal myself
a good hand.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.640
Bets. I don't have any more.
So, check, then.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.000
Check.
OK.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.080
Check.
OK.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.160
I'll check too, then.
Show us your cards, Mikey.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.360
Pair of Queens.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.800
Full house.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.000
Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!

02:56.000 --> 02:58.800
Let's just call me moneybags!
Mullah, man!

02:58.840 --> 03:01.400
Give it back, man. I need it.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.000
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.120
It's not my money. I've gotta pick
my mum's prescription up.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.200
Shouldn't gamble
if he can't afford to lose it.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.960
Don't be a shit. Just give it back.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.440
You know his mum's sick. You've
still got the rest of the money.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.520
OK, I'll give you
your ten bucks back.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.040
If...you jump.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.760
I can't do that, man.
I-I'm afraid of heights.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.000
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.440
And the rocks move. It'll be fine,
bro. Three steps. We checked it out.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.440
Just give me the fucking money, man!
What fucking money?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.840
Any money around here belongs to me.
Cough it up.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.000
What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.120
What are you playing, 52 pick up?
Piss off, Victor.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.120
Paul, tell your brother Jake won
that money fair and square.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.120
Shut your mouth, septic.
I'll bash you just for fun.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.000
You got any money?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.160
You got any money?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.400
We could play a hand.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.560
Two. Two.
Three.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.240
Three.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.000
All right...show you cards.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.560
All right...show you cards.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.160
Pair of Aces.
What've you got?

04:21.760 --> 04:24.000
Three nines. Let's go, boys!

04:24.000 --> 04:24.320
Three nines. Let's go, boys!

04:24.360 --> 04:26.800
Fuck you!

04:31.560 --> 04:32.000
Oh, shit! Fuck!

04:32.000 --> 04:33.880
Oh, shit! Fuck!

04:33.920 --> 04:36.080
Be safe, boys!

04:38.880 --> 04:40.000
Whoo!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.080
Whoo!

04:42.680 --> 04:45.360
Foley! I'll fucking get you!

04:45.400 --> 04:48.000
I will fucking find you! Fuck!

04:48.000 --> 04:48.960
I will fucking find you! Fuck!

04:56.120 --> 04:57.720
Fuck!

04:59.160 --> 05:02.000
Come on!

05:04.120 --> 05:06.880
Hey, Mikey? Yeah.
Here's your tenner. For what?

05:06.920 --> 05:09.920
You jumped! I didn't mean to.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.560
I'm at the gallery.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.760
No, no, just dropped something off.
Excuse me?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.000
OK? Bye.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.960
OK? Bye.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.440
Yeah. Sorry?

07:24.480 --> 07:28.000
No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,

07:28.000 --> 07:28.080
No, I'm sorry.
This is gonna sound really odd,

07:28.120 --> 07:31.960
but I wanna thank you. I took these
shots of you in the gallery.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.760
And I really am sorry.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.000
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.560
I just saw the way
you were looking at the art.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.200
There was just something
in the way you were taking it in.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.000
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.400
Can I buy you a coffee or something?
Can we talk?

07:47.720 --> 07:51.040
I don't want a coffee.
Do you know what the Archibald is?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.000
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.880
It's a portrait prize. Yeah.
Yeah? I wanna paint you for that.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.480
But, technically, we've gotta
spend a bit of time together.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.000
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Thing is, there's a form that needs
to be signed, and I don't have it,

08:02.040 --> 08:05.640
but maybe...you could just say,

08:05.680 --> 08:08.000
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."

08:08.000 --> 08:09.200
"Alira Morley has permission
to paint my portrait."

08:09.240 --> 08:10.960
You just have to say your name.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.280
The competition's not for six
months, so I've got plenty of time.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.840
Alira Morley has permission
to paint my porch.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.040
OK, I'm gonna go that way. No, not
yet. You gotta say your name.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.000
Jake Foley.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.560
Jake Foley.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.320
Could you maybe say your age
and what you do? Is that OK?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.680
I'm 57.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.000
And I'm a gambler.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.680
And I'm a gambler.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.120
Is that for real?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.440
You're a gambler?
Yeah.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.000
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.960
Like on sports, horses, greyhounds,
that kind of thing?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.600
No.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.000
I play poker.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.240
I play poker.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.280
Right on!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.520
Well, thanks.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.000
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?

09:04.000 --> 09:04.760
Maybe if I make the shortlist,
I'll see you at the exhibition?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.760
No, you won't.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.400
An object won't change its motion...

09:18.440 --> 09:20.000
unless a force acts on it.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
unless a force acts on it.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.240
That's one of Newton's laws.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.000
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I

09:28.000 --> 09:29.320
From the time we were teenagers,
Mikey, Alex. Paul, Drew and I

09:29.360 --> 09:31.840
were an inseparable band of pirates

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
But for quite a while now,

09:35.240 --> 09:36.000
life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.880
life and circumstance...
have been pulling us apart.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.880
And time is running out
to apply the force

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
that would bring us back together.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.320
Of all the boys,
my best friend was Drew.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.920
We had a lot in common.
Our dad's were Air Force pilots,

09:51.960 --> 09:52.000
we liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.560
we liked to take risks, and we both
love card games, specifically poker.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.000
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.880
Five card draw, seven card stud,
Texas Hold'em, Omaha,

10:01.920 --> 10:05.680
Razz, Badugi, Chinese,
deuce to seven triple draw,

10:05.720 --> 10:07.720
any kind of poker.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.760
When the first personal computers
came along,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.480
we were all over it, adapting them
to suit us,

10:13.520 --> 10:16.000
writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.040
writing our own programs
for the games we wanted to play.

10:16.080 --> 10:20.080
And in '94, we set up the world's
first online poker system.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.000
When the larger markets
opened to us...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.080
When the larger markets
opened to us...

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
..that was a waterfall.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.000
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.320
More money
than we'd ever dreamed of.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.000
Then Drew hit on something else.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.440
Then Drew hit on something else.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.600
By restructuring the code
from cards to countries,

10:44.640 --> 10:46.520
he retooled the program

10:46.560 --> 10:48.000
into a saleable military grade
surveillance software.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.800
into a saleable military grade
surveillance software.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.160
We called it RIFFLE.
Shit name, I know.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.000
Our customers are governments.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.520
Our customers are governments.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.240
But life's just a game, right?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.000
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.120
It's all in how you read
and respond to your opponents.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.480
You watch how they bet,
how much they bet.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.000
Everything they do informs you more.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.840
Everything they do informs you more.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.080
If luck is leaving you, apply
what you can to change its motion.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.000
Hey, I'm Jake.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.120
Hey, I'm Jake.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.840
Keep walking.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.000
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses...

11:28.000 --> 11:28.080
Maximise your wins,
minimise your losses...

11:28.120 --> 11:31.240
and stay in the game
as long as you can.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.120
I'm Paje.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.000
You can call me Bill. Jake.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.760
You can call me Bill. Jake.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.040
Yeah.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.040
Did you bring something else
to wear? Yeah. Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.320
This is your space.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.360
Join me outside.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.280
The medicine is telling me
you're not ready yet.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.320
So we wait.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.960
We can talk if you want.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.000
I'll talk, then.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.200
I'll talk, then.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.320
Most people come here...
for the shared experience.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.000
Safety in numbers.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.360
Safety in numbers.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.400
A shared journey.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.000
There are only three types of people
who come here

12:40.000 --> 12:42.360
There are only three types of people
who come here

12:42.400 --> 12:44.560
for a private appointment.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.000
There's the morbidly famous
who are afraid of their own shadow.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.320
There's the morbidly famous
who are afraid of their own shadow.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.920
The drug fucked...

12:51.600 --> 12:54.880
..who quite mistakenly think
this is the next great high.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.000
And the incurably curious.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.600
Now, I don't recognise your face.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.000
You don't appear to be in need.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.320
You don't appear to be in need.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.160
But there is a weight on you...

13:09.200 --> 13:12.000
and...it's related
to your mortality.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.080
and...it's related
to your mortality.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.200
How am I doing so far?

13:21.880 --> 13:23.680
100%.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.280
Death is inevitable.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.000
All living things will die.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.560
All living things will die.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.360
You have to recognise that
with relief.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.360
Embrace that knowledge.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
In my entire life...

13:39.680 --> 13:42.880
..the time I've spent
pondering my own mortality

13:42.920 --> 13:44.000
would add up to minutes, if that.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.600
would add up to minutes, if that.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.000
Maybe when my wife Allison died,

13:49.040 --> 13:52.000
I...I did ask the universe a lot
of questions then.

13:52.000 --> 13:52.240
I...I did ask the universe a lot
of questions then.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.480
I never got
any satisfactory answers.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.000
The answers don't always have
the structure we expect.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.680
The answers don't always have
the structure we expect.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.680
Sometimes,
the insistence of the question

14:06.720 --> 14:08.000
can drown out the response.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.920
can drown out the response.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.920
Let's go and untie some knots.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.000
...the next few years.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.960
...the next few years.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.000
Over the next few days, there will
always be someone here with you.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.320
Over the next few days, there will
always be someone here with you.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.000
Sometimes the body wants to merge.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.800
Sometimes the body wants to merge.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.800
..is for
what comes out of your mouth.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.640
You will know
when it's time to drink.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.000
Reject the quest
for your question...

15:28.000 --> 15:29.120
Reject the quest
for your question...

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
..to the front of your mind.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.600
You will know...

15:50.360 --> 15:52.000
..when it's time.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.120
..when it's time.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.000
Opening up to yourself...
is one thing.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
Opening up to yourself...
is one thing.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.840
Opening up to others
may still be hard.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.000
When the time's right...

17:20.000 --> 17:21.880
When the time's right...

17:22.560 --> 17:24.560
..you might be able to use this.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.000
What is it?

17:28.000 --> 17:28.760
What is it?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
Let's just call it a truth serum.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.600
A couple of drops and you'll say
what's on your mind.

17:35.960 --> 17:36.000
Perfectly harmless in small doses.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.520
Perfectly harmless in small doses.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.360
You're sweating.
It can unlock doors.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.000
It would take 10mls or more...

17:44.000 --> 17:47.280
It would take 10mls or more...

17:47.320 --> 17:50.520
directly injected to be lethal.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.000
Some people take comfort

18:00.000 --> 18:00.920
Some people take comfort

18:00.960 --> 18:05.080
in knowing that they have...
some means of control.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.000
Hone that strength.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.960
Go!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.080
Good, girl. Break there.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.000
Ready?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.640
Ready?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.920
Hey, you.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.000
You got in here like a ninja.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
You got in here like a ninja.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.640
I didn't hear one step.
What are you doing?

19:48.680 --> 19:51.400
Just checking out the house,
making sure everything's ready. Oh.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.000
Yes, big poker game.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.440
Yes, big poker game.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.160
You haven't done that in years.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, well, they've been busy,
I've been busy, that's all.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.200
Yeah, well, they've been busy,
I've been busy, that's all.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.880
Anyway, taking a break from old
friends sometimes

20:03.920 --> 20:07.080
just reminds you how much they
mean to you. I love those guys.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.000
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles

20:08.000 --> 20:10.680
They are just as much
my posse of delinquent uncles

20:10.720 --> 20:14.560
as they are your school buddies. I
will make sure they hear that, baby.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.000
I have a more serious question.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.560
I have a more serious question.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.400
Does it involve cash?
Am I your favourite child

20:21.440 --> 20:23.240
and most special daughter?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.000
I can guarantee that,
mainly because you are

20:24.000 --> 20:25.680
I can guarantee that,
mainly because you are

20:25.720 --> 20:27.640
my only child and only daughter.

20:27.680 --> 20:31.120
Hmm. As your favourite child
and most special daughter,

20:31.160 --> 20:32.000
there's the cutest denim jacket
down in the arcade. Mm-hm.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.720
there's the cutest denim jacket
down in the arcade. Mm-hm.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.760
So I was wondering...

20:39.360 --> 20:40.000
Yeah. Yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.360
Yeah. Yeah.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.240
It's cuter than that.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
Hmm.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.520
Look at what you've built.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.840
Mum would have been so proud of you.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.000
Hey, come on...

21:12.000 --> 21:12.200
Hey, come on...

21:12.240 --> 21:14.120
don't get yourself upset.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.320
Your mum...is with us every day.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.000
She sees everything.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.960
She sees everything.

21:21.720 --> 21:26.080
And you know what, she'd much
rather see you laughing than crying.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.440
I just miss her.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.960
I didn't think
I could live...a day without her,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
let alone ten years.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.600
Jake.
Sam.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.920
Let me see.
Fuck!

21:53.800 --> 21:57.800
Now...if you decide
on a testamentary trust,

21:57.840 --> 22:00.000
and we know
that time is of the essence,

22:00.000 --> 22:00.040
and we know
that time is of the essence,

22:00.080 --> 22:02.560
then you will have to nominate
a trustee. That trustee

22:02.600 --> 22:06.440
can be a person or persons,
an organisation or a trust company.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.000
If you still wanna explore the idea
of a charitable trust,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.440
If you still wanna explore the idea
of a charitable trust,

22:09.480 --> 22:13.800
then, in addition, the trustee
will have to nominate...

22:52.240 --> 22:54.920
..the trust administrator
will report back,

22:54.960 --> 22:56.000
and defend the rights
of your beneficiaries.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.800
and defend the rights
of your beneficiaries.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.040
Now, look, I know this is a lot
to take in.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.840
If you do the structure right, I
guarantee it'll be tight as a drum.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.560
And in regards to tonight,
everything's in place.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.000
I'm gonna meet the guys
down in the garage in ten minutes.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.960
I'm gonna meet the guys
down in the garage in ten minutes.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.560
Once I'm done, I'll meet you at
the pad. The pilot's standing by.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.880
Good.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.000
Have you told Drew?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.600
Have you told Drew?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.920
Not all the details, no.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.000
Devil's advocate.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.440
Devil's advocate.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.880
Tonight is all very elaborate, Jake.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.480
You certain
you wanna go through with it?

23:42.520 --> 23:44.000
And this time I'm not asking
as your lawyer.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.080
And this time I'm not asking
as your lawyer.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.920
Plenty of people get by
with flowers and cards.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.920
Well, they might not be the best
decisions I've ever made,

23:54.960 --> 23:57.600
but at least I won't live
to regret them.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.000
See you down there.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.560
See you down there.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.000
""

24:08.000 --> 24:09.840
""

24:11.280 --> 24:13.280
Yes.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.440
Sorry.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.480
What for?

24:26.720 --> 24:28.720
It was necessary.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.000
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today

24:56.000 --> 24:57.040
Minister. Minister. The report
on Family Affairs released today

24:57.080 --> 25:00.200
seems to contradict the stated
intentions of your department

25:00.240 --> 25:03.040
just earlier this year.
Beverly, what you're really saying

25:03.080 --> 25:04.000
is the press contrived
to misunderstand

25:04.000 --> 25:05.600
is the press contrived
to misunderstand

25:05.640 --> 25:07.200
the position we took last year.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.480
My department is putting the needs
of lower-income families first.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.000
And I know you personally support
that, Beverly. No, minister...

25:12.000 --> 25:14.240
And I know you personally support
that, Beverly. No, minister...

25:14.280 --> 25:16.280
Minister!

25:21.000 --> 25:24.920
Did you get the text? What the fuck
are we doing meeting in a car park?

25:24.960 --> 25:27.080
I thought we were
meeting in the penthouse.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.000
Hello, Paul. Good to see you too.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.920
Hello, Paul. Good to see you too.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.000
Maybe the car park's where the
private lift is, Minister? Yeah,

25:36.000 --> 25:36.200
Maybe the car park's where the
private lift is, Minister? Yeah,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.760
course it is. Let's do this.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.600
You wanna wait for Alex? That
arselicker's probably already here.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.000
You look like shit, by the way.
Tremendous.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.320
You look like shit, by the way.
Tremendous.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.000
Beautiful.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.080
Beautiful.

26:07.840 --> 26:08.000
OK?
Yeah.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.360
OK?
Yeah.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.000
You just have to tell him.
Get it done.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.040
Yeah.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.000
It's on tonight, all right.
Just...don't forget the gear.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.640
It's on tonight, all right.
Just...don't forget the gear.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.320
You never know
who you're gonna bump into, Billy.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.240
Some old mate you owe a favour to.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.720
Look, this bloke's different,
he's Polish or something,

26:45.760 --> 26:48.000
but we need him. He's connected
and he knows what's what.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.560
but we need him. He's connected
and he knows what's what.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.280
So just don't use your prison charm,
OK?

26:53.800 --> 26:56.000
That's all I'm asking, mate,
just nice and easy.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.360
That's all I'm asking, mate,
just nice and easy.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.000
Gentlemen.
Alex.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.360
Gentlemen.
Alex.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.560
How are you, mate?
I'm good. You?

27:07.600 --> 27:11.600
The annoying one's
apologised. Nice to meet you.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.000
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought

27:12.000 --> 27:15.160
So, are are we going upstairs or...?
Actually, Jake thought

27:15.200 --> 27:17.720
you might like to meet him down at
Pebble Cove.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.000
So he would like you guys to pick
a car to drive.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.520
So he would like you guys to pick
a car to drive.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.120
Anyone you like.
You're kidding?

27:23.160 --> 27:27.400
Keys are all in 'em. SatNavs are
programmed with the scenic route.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.000
Travel time's about 90 minutes,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.240
Travel time's about 90 minutes,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.760
but Jake would like you to think
of it as a race.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.000
Jakey, Jakey, Jakey!
Where are you going?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.560
Jakey, Jakey, Jakey!
Where are you going?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.800
Mike, I'm Sam.
Hey, Sam.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.400
Cars! You keep away,
that thing's mine.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.000
You keep away.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.160
You keep away.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.480
So, have you caught up with Jake
much lately.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.000
Oh, not much. I've...
I've been travelling.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.560
Oh, not much. I've...
I've been travelling.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.680
A coupla book tours and such.
Yeah.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.080
Yeah, life gets busy, eh?
Yeah, it does.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.000
Mike, I'm afraid,
I'm gonna have to drive you.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.800
Mike, I'm afraid,
I'm gonna have to drive you.

28:03.480 --> 28:07.200
You're kidding me?
It was a fucking sip!

28:07.240 --> 28:08.000
Ahh!

28:08.000 --> 28:09.600
Ahh!

28:11.880 --> 28:14.880
We're taking that one.
Nice choice.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.000
Is anyone gonna say go?

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
Is anyone gonna say go?

28:22.680 --> 28:24.000
"Turn right."

28:24.000 --> 28:25.240
"Turn right."

29:13.200 --> 29:15.160
Hey. You good?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.320
"Yeah, brother. How you all doing?"

29:17.360 --> 29:20.000
You gonna tune in tonight?
"Right on showtime.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.240
You gonna tune in tonight?
"Right on showtime.

29:20.280 --> 29:23.880
Look, Jake, are you really sure you
want it to go down this way, man?"

29:23.920 --> 29:26.120
There needs to be a catalyst.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.000
We haven't had
an honest conversation in years.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.520
We haven't had
an honest conversation in years.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.680
And I don't have time to wait around

29:31.720 --> 29:34.640
for these guys to get comfortable
enough to tell me the truth.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.000
"Yeah...I get it, brother."

29:36.000 --> 29:37.800
"Yeah...I get it, brother."

29:38.920 --> 29:41.120
See you soon.
"Yeah, see you."

29:48.600 --> 29:51.360
Fuck me, mate!

29:51.400 --> 29:52.000
Everything OK? Supercar race
with a soft cock for a chauffeur.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.400
Everything OK? Supercar race
with a soft cock for a chauffeur.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.800
Everything's peachy!

29:58.720 --> 30:00.000
Yeah, all the specs say
we have the fastest car.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.560
Yeah, all the specs say
we have the fastest car.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.680
Mm-hm. It's got a race engine.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
You're in a race.

30:07.960 --> 30:08.000
Maybe put your fucking foot down!

30:08.000 --> 30:10.040
Maybe put your fucking foot down!

30:55.320 --> 30:56.000
There are fresh ingredients
in the fridge if you wanna cook.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.960
There are fresh ingredients
in the fridge if you wanna cook.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.200
Everything you need
for grilled oysters

31:00.240 --> 31:03.040
is in the fridge by the barbecue.
Great. Is Penelope here?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.000
Yes, she is. Downstairs, sir.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.080
Yes, she is. Downstairs, sir.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.480
The guests are gonna be arriving
in three separate cars.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.760
Meet them in the garage, take them
to their rooms down the backstairs.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.000
No problem. After that, you guys
can take the night off.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.120
No problem. After that, you guys
can take the night off.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.160
Put the gate on code only.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Hello, Mr Jake. Everything good?
Everything in place, sir? Great.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.200
Hello, Mr Jake. Everything good?
Everything in place, sir? Great.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.960
I think I might cook tonight.
You sure you wanna do that, Mr Jake?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.920
I'll try not to make a mess.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.920
"Hello."
Thank fuck! Did you get my message?

31:47.960 --> 31:50.640
Don't go to the house tonight.
The plan has changed.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.000
"I'm not changing plans.
Everything's been organised.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.760
"I'm not changing plans.
Everything's been organised.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.760
No, no, you have to change the plan.
I thought the house would be empty.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.000
He'll be there.
"It's going ahead.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.120
He'll be there.
"It's going ahead.

32:00.160 --> 32:04.160
Time to clear your debt."
No, it can't go ahead tonight!

32:04.200 --> 32:05.800
You hear me? He'll be there!

32:05.840 --> 32:08.000
I'll be there.
It's too close! He'll know.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.160
I'll be there.
It's too close! He'll know.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.040
Please, man, just back the fuck off!

32:19.640 --> 32:22.880
Fuck! Fuck!

33:10.680 --> 33:12.000
Having fun, Mr Foley?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.080
Having fun, Mr Foley?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.840
Penelope.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.000
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes

34:00.000 --> 34:02.960
Did Sam tell you what's going on?
Only that it's big stakes

34:03.000 --> 34:06.920
and that I'll probably finish early.
He didn't elaborate.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.960
RFID chips. Live and legal tender.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.400
Cash.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.960
Five equal stacks, Texas Hold'em.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Yes, boss.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.000
Yes, of course.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.120
Yes, of course.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.320
Hey, look...I gotta go.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.040
Bye. Love you.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.000
Mikey! Let's go!

35:20.000 --> 35:21.680
Mikey! Let's go!

35:23.600 --> 35:25.840
You all right?
Yep.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.000
Let's hit it.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.160
Let's hit it.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.000
There he is.
Alex.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.840
There he is.
Alex.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.320
Good to see you, Jake.
Hiya.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.120
Paul.
Jakey boy. Always a pleasure.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.000
Mike.
Jake. Look at this!

35:44.000 --> 35:45.600
Mike.
Jake. Look at this!

35:45.640 --> 35:47.640
OK?

35:49.120 --> 35:51.920
All good, Mr Foley? All good, Chris.
See you tomorrow.

35:51.960 --> 35:52.000
You do know there are other wines
beside Henschke

35:52.000 --> 35:55.800
You do know there are other wines
beside Henschke

35:55.840 --> 35:59.440
Yeah, I have a rule with wine, don't
buy it unless you're gonna drink it.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.000
I knew you would say something like
that, so small vineyard,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.760
I knew you would say something like
that, so small vineyard,

36:02.800 --> 36:05.840
McLaren Vale shiraz. Nice.
A velvet glove.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.000
Hmm. Salute. It's been too long.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.840
Hmm. Salute. It's been too long.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.280
Cheers, lads.
To Drew and to you Jake.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.120
Absent friends.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.000
How is Drew? Good.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.320
How is Drew? Good.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.440
Mmm!
How were the cars?

36:18.480 --> 36:21.720
Oh, that Maybach is amazing!
I put my foot down and I was here.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.000
Yeah, I wouldn't know
how mine was to drive,

36:24.000 --> 36:24.120
Yeah, I wouldn't know
how mine was to drive,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.840
cos you sent the fucking fun police
over there.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.720
Well, I'm glad you liked the cars,
because they're yours.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.000
My gift.
What?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.080
My gift.
What?

36:33.120 --> 36:36.320
I mean, that Maybach
is a million-dollar car, Jake.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.240
Forgive my cynicism, but what's
the catch? There's no catch.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.000
I just thought we'd have a bit
of fun and up the stakes tonight.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.360
I just thought we'd have a bit
of fun and up the stakes tonight.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.320
The cars are yours,
titles signed over to you,

36:46.360 --> 36:48.000
or...you can give up the dream car

36:48.000 --> 36:50.200
or...you can give up the dream car

36:50.240 --> 36:52.240
and exchange it...

36:53.840 --> 36:56.000
..for $5 million in chips each.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.240
..for $5 million in chips each.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.480
Holy shit! $5 million?
Texas Hold'em.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.520
Winner take all.

37:04.120 --> 37:08.760
There's a couple of wrinkles. One,
you have to play, you can't sit out.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.000
Two, if one of you wants to keep
the car, then that's that.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.160
Two, if one of you wants to keep
the car, then that's that.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.880
It's one in, all in, and we'll
just play for our usual stakes.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.000
Fuck! Which car came first?
The Maybach.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.680
Fuck! Which car came first?
The Maybach.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.080
That puts you on the button, Alex.
You just gotta make the decision.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.160
Do you want the car,
or do you want the chips?

37:27.200 --> 37:28.000
I'll leave you to discuss it.
Sam, can answer your questions?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.920
I'll leave you to discuss it.
Sam, can answer your questions?

37:32.560 --> 37:34.720
Just remember, if you do play...

37:36.800 --> 37:39.120
..you have to accept the outcome.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.160
If you don't play...

37:42.040 --> 37:44.000
..you have to accept
that outcome too.

37:44.000 --> 37:44.320
..you have to accept
that outcome too.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.880
W-Wait. Before we start,

37:51.920 --> 37:52.000
we can't do this.
Can't do what?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.640
we can't do this.
Can't do what?

37:54.680 --> 37:58.600
We can't take the cars. You're damn
right we can't take the cars.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.000
It's five million in chips. It's
poker night, let's fucking go!

38:00.000 --> 38:02.080
It's five million in chips. It's
poker night, let's fucking go!

38:02.120 --> 38:04.800
We can't take the cars or the chips.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.840
This is crazy!

38:06.880 --> 38:08.000
I mean, let's just play
for our normal stakes, eh?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.280
I mean, let's just play
for our normal stakes, eh?

38:10.320 --> 38:12.800
I don't wanna feel like
I owe Jake anything.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.640
This is five million in chips each.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.000
Right, Sam?
Mm-hm.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.840
Right, Sam?
Mm-hm.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.880
So, what's it gonna be, gents?

38:21.440 --> 38:23.440
25 million on the table.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.000
Who are these guys?
The guys I grew up with.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.840
Who are these guys?
The guys I grew up with.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.280
I'm giving 'em
a couple of the big experiences,

38:29.320 --> 38:31.360
and fucking with their heads
for old times' sake.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.000
They will probably say stupid shit.
when they drink, OK?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.640
They will probably say stupid shit.
when they drink, OK?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.800
And they'll flirt with the bedposts
if they think they've half a chance.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.000
Mikey, wait. Just...

38:40.000 --> 38:40.920
Mikey, wait. Just...

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
This is too much.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.880
You know, I'm doing OK,
I don't need this.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.000
I'm happy for you, Alex,
that you're doing OK,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.560
I'm happy for you, Alex,
that you're doing OK,

38:50.600 --> 38:53.320
that your books are selling,
that's great.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.000
I'm not doing OK.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.640
I'm not doing OK.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.360
And I wanna play.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.400
Just say yes, Alex.
Fine.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.400
What about you, Paul?

39:09.120 --> 39:12.000
I think we should...just say yes,
Alex.

39:12.000 --> 39:12.640
I think we should...just say yes,
Alex.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.480
Mm-hm.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.240
They're in.
Good.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.000
We're doing this.
Yeah, we're doing this.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.880
We're doing this.
Yeah, we're doing this.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.280
You don't do things by halves, Jake.
Cheers. Cheers.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.000
It's just a game, Alex.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.320
It's just a game, Alex.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.320
This is a beautiful drop.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Sweet Jesus!
Fuck me!

39:44.000 --> 39:45.520
Sweet Jesus!
Fuck me!

39:45.560 --> 39:48.560
Not that I don't appreciate the
wine, Jake, it's fucking lovely,

39:48.600 --> 39:51.480
but I'll grab myself
a poker player's drink.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.000
Take the bottle.
Cheers.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.920
Take the bottle.
Cheers.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
Let's go, eh?

39:58.680 --> 40:00.000
There's a humidor over there
if you like. Don't mind if I do.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.840
There's a humidor over there
if you like. Don't mind if I do.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.000
Hello. I'm Michael.
I'm Penelope.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.120
Hello. I'm Michael.
I'm Penelope.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.080
Are you left or right-handed?
I'm right.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.760
You'll be fine.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.760
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm your dealer for tonight.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.000
My name is Penelope.
Hello, Penelope, I'm Paul.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.240
My name is Penelope.
Hello, Penelope, I'm Paul.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.440
Hi, Paul. Alex.
Alex.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.120
On my right hand here, Michael.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.000
It's a five million buy in.
No rebuys. Texas Hold'em.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.440
It's a five million buy in.
No rebuys. Texas Hold'em.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.080
Winner takes all. We will start
the small blind at 25,000,

40:53.120 --> 40:55.720
the big blind at 50,000.

40:55.760 --> 40:56.000
Good luck to you all.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.400
Good luck to you all.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.880
So, if you love art so much,
then why do you steal it?

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
To possess it.

41:04.560 --> 41:08.600
Even just briefly, to be close
enough to smell the canvas,

41:08.640 --> 41:10.760
to touch the brush strokes,

41:10.800 --> 41:12.000
to have possessed it.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.280
to have possessed it.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.640
Maybe it's just a bit too obtuse

41:16.680 --> 41:18.680
and deep for you, Billy.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.000
Maybe you're just not smart enough
to understand.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.880
Maybe you're just not smart enough
to understand.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.440
I'm smart enough to know
which part of your face

41:26.480 --> 41:28.000
is gonna bleed the most.

41:28.000 --> 41:28.480
is gonna bleed the most.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.600
Fucking ferret!

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Here comes the target.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.000
Call.
Call.

42:08.040 --> 42:10.840
Raise...175.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.800
Raise 175,000.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.000
Out.
Alex is out.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.360
Out.
Alex is out.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.400

42:23.680 --> 42:24.000

42:24.000 --> 42:25.680
Call.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.720
Call.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.000
Check. Check.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.080
Check. Check.

42:35.280 --> 42:39.680
Check. Bet.
Bet 100,000.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.000
Raise 400.
Raise 400.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.400
Raise 400.
Raise 400.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.000
Call.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.040
Call.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.360
Call.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.000
Sam's out.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.160
Sam's out.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.000
Check.
Check.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
700,000.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.280
Michael?

43:11.720 --> 43:12.000
Raise two million.
Raise two million.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.920
Raise two million.
Raise two million.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.000
Paul is out.

43:20.000 --> 43:20.360
Paul is out.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.200
All in.
Jake goes all in.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.720
Michael?

43:33.760 --> 43:36.000
A quick game
is a good game, eh, Jake?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.680
A quick game
is a good game, eh, Jake?

43:39.280 --> 43:42.600
Thanks for the invite.
I call. All in.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.000
First fucking hand.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.520
First fucking hand.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.760
Ten million in the pot.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.000
Oh!
Oh, you both have the same cards.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.680
Oh!
Oh, you both have the same cards.

43:53.720 --> 43:57.280
Jack and ten. Michael has hearts,
Jake has diamonds.

43:57.320 --> 44:00.000
We have a straight
or a possible flush draw on both.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.240
We have a straight
or a possible flush draw on both.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.000
Split pot, gentlemen.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.560
Split pot, gentlemen.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.680
Right down the middle.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.000
Straight down the middle.

44:16.000 --> 44:16.760
Straight down the middle.

44:35.280 --> 44:38.120
..talking about you walking
from Melbourne to Sydney,

44:38.160 --> 44:40.000
for about 25 fucking years.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.120
for about 25 fucking years.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.640
And the bit of the story
I've never figured out,

44:43.680 --> 44:46.520
you didn't actually complete
the journey? Oh, I did, yeah.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.000
I did. I did.

44:48.000 --> 44:48.600
I did. I did.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.440
In a car.
Start telling that story

44:51.480 --> 44:55.640
in the future about the walk you
did from Melbourne to Sydney,

44:55.680 --> 44:56.000
tell the story about the walk from
Melbourne to Orbost. That's right.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.640
tell the story about the walk from
Melbourne to Orbost. That's right.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.640
It is false advertising, mate.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.000
It's a big title, and the story
doesn't live up to the title.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.520
It's a big title, and the story
doesn't live up to the title.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.280
Absolutely false advertising.
A bit like your last book.

45:15.520 --> 45:19.640
And then he proceeded to offer me
this...cigarette.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.000
Did you imbibe? I did.
I thought it would be rude not to.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.080
Did you imbibe? I did.
I thought it would be rude not to.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.920
So, anyway, I don't feel
particularly different,

45:25.960 --> 45:28.000
until later that night, I went
upstairs to the restaurant,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.520
until later that night, I went
upstairs to the restaurant,

45:29.560 --> 45:32.880
and I'm watching this band,
and then I turn around

45:32.920 --> 45:36.000
and look out the window, and I came
back and there's the kitchen.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.160
and look out the window, and I came
back and there's the kitchen.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.520
The band's fucking disappeared!

45:38.560 --> 45:41.840
So I look out the window again,
there's the band again.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.000
And I'm fucking falling over
all the time going,

45:44.000 --> 45:44.840
And I'm fucking falling over
all the time going,

45:44.880 --> 45:47.040
"I must be really
out of my mind here."

45:47.080 --> 45:49.000
It took me about an hour to realise

45:49.040 --> 45:52.000
that it was a revolving rooftop
restaurant.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.120
that it was a revolving rooftop
restaurant.

45:53.160 --> 45:56.120
You fucking idiot! I know.
That's brilliant!

45:56.160 --> 45:58.960
And that was my start in politics.

46:01.800 --> 46:05.040
Oh, fuck off!

46:14.560 --> 46:16.000
Mr Foley
left me a gift in my locker.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.080
Mr Foley
left me a gift in my locker.

46:17.120 --> 46:19.600
No, I'm gonna show you
when I get home.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.000
We can go anywhere you want.
Look, I'm excited.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.160
We can go anywhere you want.
Look, I'm excited.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.560
You've gotta see it to believe it.
Look, I'm on my way home now,

46:28.600 --> 46:30.600
I'll see you soon.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.200
What's going on, man?!

46:56.840 --> 46:59.520
We get to Vegas,
we get to the hotel rooms,

46:59.560 --> 47:03.000
so I start googling...
arse problems.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.000
Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.920
Caution! Caution!
My arse is in danger!

47:06.960 --> 47:09.720
Right. Every time
you flinch your sphincter,

47:09.760 --> 47:11.960
it was like an electric shock
through my body.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
We get to this specialist, and I lay
down, and Alex is there with me.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.440
Thank you, Alex. And I lay down,

47:18.480 --> 47:20.000
and he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!

47:20.000 --> 47:20.960
and he has a look at it.
He's like, "Oh, yep!

47:21.000 --> 47:23.920
Yeah, you've got
a perianal abscess." Ohh!

47:23.960 --> 47:27.680
It was a terrific weekend in Vegas,
wasn't it, Alex?

47:27.720 --> 47:28.000
"Hey, Bec."

47:28.000 --> 47:30.400
"Hey, Bec."

47:31.680 --> 47:33.680
When were you going to tell me?

47:33.720 --> 47:36.000
Er, hey, I'm driving,

47:36.000 --> 47:36.720
Er, hey, I'm driving,

47:36.760 --> 47:38.760
this is some pretty big stuff.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.320
Just let me pull over and we can
talk properly.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.000
I'm a kid, is that it? I can't
handle reality or something?

47:44.000 --> 47:47.080
I'm a kid, is that it? I can't
handle reality or something?

47:47.120 --> 47:50.440
"What's the reason
for keeping me in that dark?"

47:50.480 --> 47:52.000
Listen, kiddo...

47:52.000 --> 47:52.840
Listen, kiddo...

47:55.800 --> 47:57.880
..about five months ago...

48:00.760 --> 48:02.760
This is really hard.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.000
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?

48:08.000 --> 48:08.440
Your dad had a vasectomy. OK?

48:09.360 --> 48:13.280
"He didn't... He just did it,
he didn't discuss it with me.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.000
Now I've always known
that your dad, he...

48:16.000 --> 48:18.560
Now I've always known
that your dad, he...

48:18.600 --> 48:23.240
he loves you so much. And he didn't
wanna complicate your life

48:23.280 --> 48:24.000
with a half-sibling
when you were younger."

48:24.000 --> 48:25.720
with a half-sibling
when you were younger."

48:25.760 --> 48:28.640
But I always thought that...

48:28.680 --> 48:31.720
we would eventually get the chance
to have a baby.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.360
So the vasectomy news...

48:35.400 --> 48:37.560
that was, er...

48:37.600 --> 48:39.960
I've been in his office...

48:41.160 --> 48:43.960
..looking at his medical records.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.000
He was diagnosed in September

48:48.000 --> 48:50.080
He was diagnosed in September

48:50.120 --> 48:51.960
with pancreatic cancer.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.000
"He's dying!

48:56.000 --> 48:56.760
"He's dying!

48:57.760 --> 48:59.800
He's dying!"

48:59.840 --> 49:01.920
He wasn't going to tell me!

49:05.440 --> 49:07.440
It's OK, Bec,

49:07.480 --> 49:09.760
I'm gonna come and get you, OK?
""

49:09.800 --> 49:12.000
Just stay where you are, OK?
It's OK, honey, I'm coming.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.600
Just stay where you are, OK?
It's OK, honey, I'm coming.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.760
I'm gonna come and get you and then

49:15.800 --> 49:18.640
we'll both go and talk to your dad
together, OK?

49:33.680 --> 49:36.000
500.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.400
500.

49:37.720 --> 49:41.120
Hey, Sam,
go and check that out for me.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.000
The door might not be closed,
it's activating the system.

49:44.000 --> 49:44.280
The door might not be closed,
it's activating the system.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.320
Yeah, no problem.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.000
Just two pair.
Didn't actually have the eight.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.360
Just two pair.
Didn't actually have the eight.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.400
Again!

50:11.440 --> 50:13.440
Look at this guy.

50:13.480 --> 50:16.000
I hope he's a better lawyer

50:16.000 --> 50:16.840
I hope he's a better lawyer

50:16.880 --> 50:19.760
than he is a card player.
So do I.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.800
Call.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.520
Anyone of you motherfuckers
gonna deal me in? Drew!

50:36.560 --> 50:39.360
Drew! Hey, Drew!

50:39.400 --> 50:40.000
What's up, brother? How you doing?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.320
What's up, brother? How you doing?

50:42.360 --> 50:45.160
What's up, brother?

50:45.200 --> 50:47.320
Get the man a drink.
What are you having, Drew?

50:47.360 --> 50:48.000
Tequila on ice, slice of pineapple.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.200
Tequila on ice, slice of pineapple.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.480
Alrighty.
He likes his fruit.

50:52.520 --> 50:56.000
Hey. Some things
I need to catch you up on.

50:56.000 --> 50:56.320
Hey. Some things
I need to catch you up on.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.840
Yeah, I'm seeing the big money move.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.320
I know I said I wasn't
gonna make it, but...

51:03.360 --> 51:04.000
Are we gonna keep playing?
No, I don't think so.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.160
Are we gonna keep playing?
No, I don't think so.

51:06.200 --> 51:09.560
Where's she going?
We're still playing, aren't we?

51:12.160 --> 51:14.880
Fuck me!

51:40.640 --> 51:44.000
Jake asked me to turn RIFFLE
on to you guys this week.

51:44.000 --> 51:44.240
Jake asked me to turn RIFFLE
on to you guys this week.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.240
Why would you turn a military grade
surveillance programme on us?

51:47.280 --> 51:49.960
At first it was just for laughs,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
maybe catch you scratching
your balls in your driveway,

51:52.000 --> 51:52.680
maybe catch you scratching
your balls in your driveway,

51:52.720 --> 51:55.560
show it on poker night. But RIFFLE
doesn't stop,

51:55.600 --> 51:59.520
it crisscrosses your cell phones,
home security, computers.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.000
Now, I'm not saying
we know everything,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.120
Now, I'm not saying
we know everything,

52:02.160 --> 52:05.440
but we know enough to get me
on a motherfucking plane.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.480
I feel sick!

52:16.520 --> 52:19.600
I'm not surprised, Alex.
I poisoned you.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.720
On the base
of your toasting glasses.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.000
It would have got on your hands...
your faces.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.080
It would have got on your hands...
your faces.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.560
And now it's in your bloodstream.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
That's not funny.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.000
Are you serious?!

52:40.000 --> 52:40.520
Are you serious?!

52:40.560 --> 52:42.960
Poisoned? Fuck off, he's joking.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.920
Is he?

52:46.600 --> 52:48.000
I'm sweating like a motherfucker.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.960
I'm sweating like a motherfucker.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.960
I don't feel too good.
First signs are sweating...

52:53.960 --> 52:56.000
loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?

52:56.000 --> 52:56.880
loss of balance, nausea, and then...
Then what?

52:56.920 --> 52:58.920
Stop fucking around.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.960
You want us dead?

53:02.840 --> 53:04.000
I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.400
I've been diagnosed with an
inoperable pancreatic cancer.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
It's a death sentence.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.000
So now we're all on the same level.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.320
So now we're all on the same level.

53:16.720 --> 53:19.320
Touchpad. Bring him over.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.240
Beautiful.

53:24.280 --> 53:27.360
You've done the job for me.
Jesus! Fuck!

53:27.400 --> 53:28.000
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.080
What the fuck, Mikey? What was you
gonna do, shoot us? Shoot Jake? Me.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
I was gonna shoot me.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.640
That was the plan.

53:39.840 --> 53:43.560
I was gonna say goodbye to you
all and...shoot myself.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.000
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?

53:44.000 --> 53:47.200
Is this about the business? You
think, we was gonna let you drown?

53:47.240 --> 53:51.520
Why didn't you reach out? Yeah. I
had no idea you were this unhappy.

53:52.840 --> 53:56.040
I put back two bottles of vodka
a day, Alex.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.840
That's not the habit
of a happy person.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.560
I'm all right with death.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.840
I'm not!

54:07.880 --> 54:08.000
I have a wife and kids.
I've got people who depend on me.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.840
I have a wife and kids.
I've got people who depend on me.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.000
What is the code?

54:16.000 --> 54:16.520
What is the code?

54:18.880 --> 54:21.560
I can't tell you.
What's the code?

54:22.320 --> 54:24.000
You want another one?
What is the fucking code?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
You want another one?
What is the fucking code?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Car! Car, car!

54:28.960 --> 54:30.920
Get rid of the van! Come on.

54:37.520 --> 54:40.000
I said get down! Get down!

54:40.000 --> 54:40.280
I said get down! Get down!

54:40.320 --> 54:42.800
Hey...no noise, you hear me?

54:44.640 --> 54:46.680
Right, when the car goes through,

54:46.720 --> 54:48.000
jumped in front of the gates,
stop 'em from closing.

54:48.000 --> 54:48.800
jumped in front of the gates,
stop 'em from closing.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.200
What?

54:51.240 --> 54:53.800
It doesn't work that way,
it keeps going.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.000
The gate can crush the car.
Is that right? Thanks.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.720
The gate can crush the car.
Is that right? Thanks.

55:05.120 --> 55:08.560
You got a bunch of bank accounts,
Paul. Savings, checking,

55:08.600 --> 55:11.720
all on zero. How's that taking care
of your family?

55:16.840 --> 55:18.840
I'm being blackmailed.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.080
They've got video of me with a girl.
If it comes out, I'm...

55:24.120 --> 55:27.880
I gave them all the money I have,
they want more than I have.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.000
Tell me the code.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.520
Tell me the code.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.560
Tell me the code
or you're gonna get crushed!

55:34.600 --> 55:36.000
Fucking hurry up, mates. Tell me the
code or you're gonna get crushed.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.560
Fucking hurry up, mates. Tell me the
code or you're gonna get crushed.

55:37.600 --> 55:41.480
Oi! Code. You're gonna turn into
a puddle in a minute. Code.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.840
Tell him!

55:46.480 --> 55:48.480
1967!

55:59.840 --> 56:00.000
I thought we were just here
to steal, we are murderers now?

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
I thought we were just here
to steal, we are murderers now?

56:03.040 --> 56:05.720
You'll only get manslaughter
at most.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.000
And after you couldn't give the
dude no more money, what did you do?

56:08.000 --> 56:10.560
And after you couldn't give the
dude no more money, what did you do?

56:10.600 --> 56:12.600
What did you give 'em, Paul?

56:18.160 --> 56:20.160
Jake.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.400
Email addresses, phone numbers...

56:24.200 --> 56:26.080
..sensitive information.

56:26.120 --> 56:30.880
I was just trying to buy time.
I promise, Jake. I'm sorry, man.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.920
Who's blackmailing you?

56:38.720 --> 56:40.000
Victor.
Your brother?!

56:40.000 --> 56:41.400
Victor.
Your brother?!

56:42.360 --> 56:44.360
Yeah, my brother.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.480
I'm...

56:51.520 --> 56:53.600
I'm just so fucking ashamed!

56:56.920 --> 56:59.840
Oh, fuck!
What is it?

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
I'm having an affair.

57:08.600 --> 57:12.000
A terribly inexact word.

57:12.000 --> 57:12.560
A terribly inexact word.

57:14.040 --> 57:16.280
Insufficient.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.000
It was never my intention
to deliberately betray anyone.

57:20.000 --> 57:20.680
It was never my intention
to deliberately betray anyone.

57:23.640 --> 57:27.800
What happened to me, Jake,
is that I fell in love.

57:27.840 --> 57:28.000
It just so happens I fell in love
with the woman you're married to.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.160
It just so happens I fell in love
with the woman you're married to.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.640
I can't die.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.000
We're having a baby.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.360
We're having a baby.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.920
I can't die.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.600
You're not gonna fucking die.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.200
Not tonight, anyway.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.000
I just used a couple of drops,
nowhere near enough to kill you.

58:00.000 --> 58:00.280
I just used a couple of drops,
nowhere near enough to kill you.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.280
Just enough to fuck you up
and get you thinking.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.160
It'll wear off soon.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.000
I just wanted you for a moment
to feel where I am.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.920
I just wanted you for a moment
to feel where I am.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.960
To see things through my eyes.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.400
My little girl
is about to be hit by a train.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.000
And there's nothing
I can do about it...

58:24.000 --> 58:24.280
And there's nothing
I can do about it...

58:26.640 --> 58:28.640
..cos I am the train.

58:40.680 --> 58:42.800
So how long have you got, man?

58:44.880 --> 58:47.480
Long enough to finish the game?

58:49.320 --> 58:51.680
Fuck!

58:52.680 --> 58:56.000
Lawyers recommend trust funds so
they can keep charging annual fees.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.440
Lawyers recommend trust funds so
they can keep charging annual fees.

58:57.480 --> 59:00.400
In fact, in most instances, simply
transferring money

59:00.440 --> 59:02.880
is a tax-free gift
to any normal bank account.

59:04.880 --> 59:06.880
That's the better option.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
You fucking guys don't get it.

59:12.000 --> 59:12.960
You fucking guys don't get it.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.840
Jake and I brought you into
the company at the ground level.

59:15.880 --> 59:20.000
Mikey, you sold your shares in a
week. Alex traded his for a Rolex.

59:20.000 --> 59:20.080
Mikey, you sold your shares in a
week. Alex traded his for a Rolex.

59:20.120 --> 59:23.200
And Paul goes to Vegas first class.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.400
Now, if it was up to me,

59:25.440 --> 59:28.000
I would have given you all
that we put aside for you.

59:28.000 --> 59:28.760
I would have given you all
that we put aside for you.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.640
And I told him, "Chill the fuck out,
let's just start them with half."

59:31.680 --> 59:33.720
Because we know you motherfuckers.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.000
What do you mean?
We've still got shares? Yeah.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.200
What do you mean?
We've still got shares? Yeah.

59:38.040 --> 59:40.040
How much?

59:41.160 --> 59:43.800
$25 million in poker chips.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.920
Get fucked!

59:59.880 --> 1:00:00.000
Erm, Jake?

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.840
Erm, Jake?

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:04.960
What the fuck?

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:08.000
I hope this isn't another one
of your surprises, Jake? No.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.200
I hope this isn't another one
of your surprises, Jake? No.

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:13.440
It's Victor. He's here for the art.

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:15.480
Ah, fuck!

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:20.400
When you said then house
was full of Australian art,

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:23.440
did you mean pieces like this?
They don't know where we are,

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:24.000
let's fuck off before they find
the stairs. Through the cellar.

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.560
let's fuck off before they find
the stairs. Through the cellar.

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:30.440
Aboriginal art is not my forte.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:32.000
Are they worth anything?
Well, yes, some of them are.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.920
Are they worth anything?
Well, yes, some of them are.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.440
Very expensive, but...
the market for this art

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:40.000
attracts a certain type of buyer

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:40.480
attracts a certain type of buyer

1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:42.640
who connects with it
on a spiritual plane.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:45.320
It's a big house, find us something
we can sell.

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.000
Do you think the place is empty?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:56.640
Do you think the place is empty?

1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:59.760
Three cars came in, four came out,
all different cars.

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:02.040
Shush!
Don't fucking shush me!

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:08.120
They have guns.

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:16.640
Don't worry about that.

1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:18.680
Warhol.

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:20.000
Well, he's famous, right?
Too famous.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000
Well, he's famous, right?
Too famous.

1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.160
It's a Sunday B Morning print.

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:27.280
A couple of grand retail if that.

1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:28.000
Not for us.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.320
Not for us.

1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:47.720
Not bad.

1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:52.000
Henry James Johnstone.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:52.240
Henry James Johnstone.

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:56.440
Hard to find in this condition.

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:00.000
Look at the way
he painted the light.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:00.600
Look at the way
he painted the light.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:03.720
He came to Australia
to mine for gold,

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:06.320
ironically, became a photographer.

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:08.000
Valuable?
Hmm.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.200
Valuable?
Hmm.

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:11.800
We could probably sell them.

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:14.080
It wouldn't be a big ticket, though.

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.360
Oi!

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:16.000
Stairs down here.

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.560
Stairs down here.

1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:32.000
Shh!

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:32.080
Shh!

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:36.920
"All right, here we go.

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:38.760
You want a drink?

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.000
Somebody already has.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:40.800
Somebody already has.

1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:12.000
Oh.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:12.360
Oh.

1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:14.600
Look at this! Nice!

1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:18.240
And this is a fucking
two storeys underground. Boom!

1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:20.000
Nobody's home.
Yes, there is.

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:20.800
Nobody's home.
Yes, there is.

1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:24.960
This cigar didn't light itself.

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.720
There's a lot of eye candy in here.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000
They're hiding somewhere.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000
They're hiding somewhere.

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:38.960
Billy, check around.

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.720
OK, we got the guns, let's stop
these fuckers. I don't have guns.

1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:44.000
You got a panic room, no firearms?

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:44.320
You got a panic room, no firearms?

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:47.320
I've got a panic room
so I don't need firearms.

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.040
Victor, they probably
just fucked off. Look around!

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:52.000
OK.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.960
OK.

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:58.280
Victor.
Victor, look at this room, man!

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:00.000
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.160
Top dollar!
It's like Ali Baba's cave, man!

1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:08.000
What am I looking at?
1889. Melbourne.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.360
What am I looking at?
1889. Melbourne.

1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:10.840
9x5 Impression exhibition.

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:13.840
182 works painted mainly
on cigar box lids.

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.000
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:16.720
They sold for a guinea each,
a couple of bucks.

1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:20.920
Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton,
Charles Conder.

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.960
You've hit the trifecta!

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.480
Now you are looking at three million
at auction, easy.

1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:29.440
Grey market to us,
high six figures.

1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:31.880
Happy days!

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:40.000
I know you're still here, Jake.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000
I know you're still here, Jake.

1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:46.960
Ha! Yes, you fucking are,
aren't you!

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.720
Hello, Jake. It's been a while.

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.640
Aren't you gonna say
hey to an old mate?

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:56.000
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:56.480
We ain't gonna hurt anyone,
we're just gonna take the art.

1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:00.440
Ask the Minister why it's safer
not to call the cops.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.000
Why the fuck are we on TV?

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:04.440
Why the fuck are we on TV?

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:07.320
Because our host
is still somewhere in the house.

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.000
Check up those stairs.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.440
What else is in here?

1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:19.440
We were just gonna hit this place
in darkness.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:20.000
Nothing personal. Then Paul said

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.040
Nothing personal. Then Paul said

1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:25.480
you were gonna be here
and I thought, "Fuck it!

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:27.400
I wanna make it personal!"

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:28.000
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.360
A panic room? You can't shoot
a motherfucker with it.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:33.880
We've got Mike's gun.
It's only got one bullet.

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:36.000
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.880
I was planning on killing myself,
you only need one bullet for that.

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:42.680
Clarice Beckett. Genius!

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:46.520
We can move these in a heartbeat.

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:49.720
Another Streeton.

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:52.000
William Dobell.
Woman In Restaurant.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:52.680
William Dobell.
Woman In Restaurant.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.920
Last sold for 935,000!

1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:00.000
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000
John Peter Russell! So rare!
He had hardly ever exhibited.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.400
Classmate of Lautrec and Van Gogh.

1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:08.000
He destroyed 400 of his masterworks
in grief when his wife died.

1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:10.960
This is real fucking money!
How much?

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.240
Even at bargain basement,
we are walking away

1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:16.000
with a couple of million.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:16.960
with a couple of million.

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:18.800
You hear that, Jake?

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:21.760
We know what you've got here!

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.000
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:24.360
Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen.
I didn't see anyone there.

1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:27.040
Just like I haven't seen anyone out
here or in the garage.

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:29.960
And you know what that is, Victor?
Cos there's no one fucking here.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.520
Help Styx.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:35.400
Let's go!

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:38.680
Jake, there's six of us and three of
them, we can take 'em.

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:40.000
It's only fucking Victor.

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.160
It's only fucking Victor.

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:44.200
They've got three shotguns
against one bullet.

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.320
Let's just stay down here
until he fucks off, OK?

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:48.000
The more adrenalized he gets,
the harder that drug's gonna hit.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.400
The more adrenalized he gets,
the harder that drug's gonna hit.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:17.200
So, what's this worth?
A couple of hundred K maybe.

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:20.000
He painted a lot Streeton. Even
with a less significant work,

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.360
He painted a lot Streeton. Even
with a less significant work,

1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:24.960
he leaves his mark of genius. Look.

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.000
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:28.280
A lot of people believe that these
marks of reflection

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:32.480
are Streeton painting a portrait of
himself painting the glass.

1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:36.000
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:36.520
You see? It's like a man leaning
over an easel.

1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:41.160
So, our mate had a green head,
did he?

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.000
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:44.400
I tell ya, there's a really good
painting in the kitchen.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:47.160
It's a couple of men playing cards,
one's smoking a pipe,

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:51.120
wearing funny hats. That's the type
of painting I like. You know why?

1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:52.000
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.720
Hmm? Cos it tells a fucking story.

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:56.640
A couple of blokes playing poker,

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.200
they're on the piss,
they're talking shit.

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.000
I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.400
I mean,
that's just a fucking goblet.

1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:04.960
A white pipe?
Yeah.

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.640
A tall hat?
Yeah, a funny hat.

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:40.000
Fuck!

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:40.520
Fuck!

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:42.800
Jesus! What's she doing here?

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:47.040
Billy! Visitors.

1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:48.000
Who's this, Jake?

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.520
Who's this, Jake?

1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:54.560
Plan's changed. Give me the gun.
There's only one bullet in it, man.

1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:56.000
They don't know that. Mikey, we're
gonna go with your plan.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.360
They don't know that. Mikey, we're
gonna go with your plan.

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:02.480
I'll bluff this prick and I'll split
'em up. I'll come with you.

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:04.000
Get the door, Mike.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:04.520
Get the door, Mike.

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:07.600
Dad? Dad?

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:11.000
Hello, ladies.
Oh, hello, ladies!

1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:12.000
Come on, come here.
Come here.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.240
Come on, come here.
Come here.

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.520
Get off!

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.920
Come here. Argh!

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:20.000
Shit!

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.240
Shit!

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:24.400
Come here!

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.960
Come here!

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.560
Come...
Come here you...

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.320
Come here!

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:49.920
Victor. Victor.

1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:52.000
Victor! The painting in the kitchen
is a fucking Cezanne!

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.760
Victor! The painting in the kitchen
is a fucking Cezanne!

1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:58.080
That's a $200 million item!

1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:00.000
Who are we dealing with here?

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:00.120
Who are we dealing with here?

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:04.320
People who own art like that have
got many ways of fucking you up.

1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:07.680
Go...away!

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:16.000
My lucky day after all.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:16.520
My lucky day after all.

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.960
You know, things were looking dull
as shit till you turned up.

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.960
Well, this changes things,
doesn't it, Jake?

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.120
I'm assuming you know these women.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:28.480
Come on in here, you prick!

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:32.000
Do you hear me, Jake?
Get your arse in here!

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:32.840
Do you hear me, Jake?
Get your arse in here!

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:35.160
What the fuck, man?!

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.200
Dad! Shit!

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:40.000
Who the fuck is this?!
Our host.

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:40.120
Who the fuck is this?!
Our host.

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.400
Jake...Fucking...Foley!

1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.000
Lok at you, Big Shot. You come into
the room, gun in your hand,

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.320
Lok at you, Big Shot. You come into
the room, gun in your hand,

1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.400
like a common criminal. Victor.
I see you're the same shit magnet

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.000
who goes around stealing
other people's stuff.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.600
who goes around stealing
other people's stuff.

1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:01.040
Don't get too cocky, Foley, you've
got three shotguns trained on you,

1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:04.000
you can't get all of us!
I'm only aiming at you, Victor.

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.080
you can't get all of us!
I'm only aiming at you, Victor.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.240
Well, I guess we're in
a Mexican stand-off my friend.

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:12.000
You shoot me,

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.800
You shoot me,

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:18.320
I may or may not die, depends if you
can shoot really, doesn't it?

1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:20.000
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.400
And even if you get me, these two
will still shoot you, take your art

1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:25.800
and damage these fine specimens.
No, I won't.

1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:28.000
I'm here to steal,
I'm not damaging anyone.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:28.200
I'm here to steal,
I'm not damaging anyone.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.480
I will. If he kills you, Vic,
I'll defend your honour.

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.960
The art'll just be a bonus. If you
you wanna still art to make money,

1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:36.000
upstairs in the kitchen, that's the
one. I told you.

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.720
upstairs in the kitchen, that's the
one. I told you.

1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:41.720
Cezanne. 200 fucking million!
No, you didn't, I told you that.

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.000
You were going gaga
about the fucking goblet.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:44.160
You were going gaga
about the fucking goblet.

1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:47.840
Just take it and fuck off. You don't
tell me what to fucking do!

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:51.000
Go and get it.

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:52.000
It's a two-man job.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.040
It's a two-man job.

1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:55.800
Then fucking get it, both of you!

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.000
They're going to the kitchen.
Right. Righto. Let's go.

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.960
They're going to the kitchen.
Right. Righto. Let's go.

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.720
Ahh! Don't be a clever Dick, Foley.

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:08.000
These girls'll get the blast
before you do.

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.240
These girls'll get the blast
before you do.

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.360
How do you wanna play this, Jake?

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.000
Dad, I'm scared! It's OK, baby.
It's gonna be OK.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000
Dad, I'm scared! It's OK, baby.
It's gonna be OK.

1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:44.800
What's going on? Who is this guy?

1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:48.000
Where is everyone else?
We are old friends.

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.040
Where is everyone else?
We are old friends.

1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:52.160
Aren't we, Jake?
He's Paul's brother.

1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:55.600
The others are sick. Sick?

1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:56.000
Sick from what? Poison.
Poison?!

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.280
Sick from what? Poison.
Poison?!

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:00.920
Jake, what's going on?!

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:04.000
Have you ever tried to sell
high-end stolen art, Victor?

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:04.600
Have you ever tried to sell
high-end stolen art, Victor?

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.560
Whatever that kid's telling you...

1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:11.360
..art collectors,
they like to show off.

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:12.000
Who you gonna sell it to?

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.720
Who you gonna sell it to?

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:16.200
I'm connected,
I can fence anything.

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.240
Are you feeling OK?

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.720
You don't look so good.

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:27.680
Did you touch that glass?

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:31.640
Yeah, yeah, I touched the glass.
So...so what?

1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:35.280
Well,
you might have a problem with that.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:36.000
That's where the poison was...
on the glass.

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.560
That's where the poison was...
on the glass.

1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:43.920
Bullshit, Foley. Why would there be
poisoned on the glass?

1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:44.000
I'll let you ask my soon-to-be
ex-wife Nicole here.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.960
I'll let you ask my soon-to-be
ex-wife Nicole here.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.920
She's been having an affair.
I decided to poison her lover.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.000
What have you done?

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:52.960
What have you done?

1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:55.680
I don't believe ya.
Ask her.

1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.600
Nicole, have you or have you not
been fucking one of my friends?

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:02.400
Where's Alex?

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:08.000
Where's Alex?! You can feel the
poison taking hold now, can't you?

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.080
Where's Alex?! You can feel the
poison taking hold now, can't you?

1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:14.080
Right there...I've got a safe,

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:16.000
In it is a bunch of cash and what
you'll need to stop the poison.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.680
In it is a bunch of cash and what
you'll need to stop the poison.

1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:24.000
I need it too.

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:24.240
I need it too.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.120
OK...
I'm gonna go and open the safe.

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:45.480
One jumps, we all jump.

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:56.000
Oh, boy!

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.320
Oh, boy!

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.720
Go, go, go!
What's this? Watch out!

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:11.280
Get him! Get him!

1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.200
Slowly. Slowly.

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:28.000
Got him?

Thanks for the money. I win!

So far up your own arse,
aren't you, Foley?

1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:48.000
You always thought you were better
than anyone else!

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:53.880
Well, I'll leave you here
so these women can watch you die!
