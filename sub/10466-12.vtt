09:55.420 --> 09:57.640
SPREADING LIES WITH
MY 12th-GRADE PAPERS.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.599
HA HA HA!

10:01.513 --> 10:04.168
THIS IS FUN...

10:04.168 --> 10:06.997
YOU KNOW, STUDYING
AND WHATEVER.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.609
AS MUCH FUN AS
STUDYING CAN BE.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.828
IT'S FUN FOR ME.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.614
I MEAN, WITH
EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW,

10:14.614 --> 10:17.094
YOU'RE REALLY
MY FRIEND.

10:17.094 --> 10:20.054
WELL, YEAH. OF COURSE.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.404
AND I REALLY
LIKE YOU.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.927
I MEAN...

10:23.927 --> 10:26.103
I DO.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.323
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH...

10:30.368 --> 10:32.675
I THINK IT'S
MORE THAN THAT.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.246
I THINK I LOVE YOU.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.511
REED?

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

10:45.993 --> 10:48.256
YEAH, YEAH.
MM-HMM.

10:52.434 --> 10:56.220
SO, IS IT FAIR TO SAY
THAT SITTING BULL
TRUSTED GRANT?

10:56.220 --> 10:58.353
OR IS THAT
A BIG LIE, TOO?

10:58.353 --> 11:01.486
NO. YOU CAN SAY THAT.

11:01.486 --> 11:05.839
I MEAN, FOR A WHILE
THERE, IT WAS TRUE.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.161
[SIGHS]

11:26.207 --> 11:28.862
OW.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.087
[CLUNK]

11:37.087 --> 11:38.262
UHH!

11:40.221 --> 11:41.831
JULIA! BAILEY!

11:41.831 --> 11:43.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:43.833 --> 11:45.269
I NEEDED THE NAME
FOR THE CHIMNEY GUY.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.010
IT'S 7:00 IN
THE MORNING.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.838
THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE FLUE AT
THE RESTAURANT.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.797
I GOTTA GET SOMEBODY
THERE BEFORE THE
LUNCH SHIFT.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.363
HAVE YOU SEEN
A PRESCRIPTION
ANYWHERE?

11:52.363 --> 11:54.017
WHAT FOR?

11:54.017 --> 11:55.627
WE USED ALL OF CHARLIE'S
ANTI-NAUSEA STUFF.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.847
I SAID I'D PICK
SOME UP FOR HIM.

11:57.847 --> 12:01.198
GEEZ, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
SOMEBODY DID LAUNDRY
AROUND THIS PLACE?

12:01.198 --> 12:03.200
I ASKED CLAUDIA
TO DO A LOAD
LAST NIGHT,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.289
BUT SHE SAID SHE
HAD A STUDY DATE
OR SOMETHING.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.988
DO YOU THINK IF IT'S A REFILL,
THEY'LL HAVE IT IN THE COMPUTER?

12:07.988 --> 12:10.904
THINK HE'D HAVE IT
UNDER "F" FOR FIREPLACE
OR "C" FOR CHIMNEY?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.688
[COINS CLATTERING]FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.255
SORRY, SORRY.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.647
SORRY.
WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO WAKE YOU UP.

12:15.647 --> 12:16.866
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.173
YEAH. WE'LL GET
OUTTA YOUR HAIR.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.871
THE PRESCRIPTION'S
UNDER THE LUNCH BOX MAGNET
ON THE REFRIGERATOR,

12:21.871 --> 12:23.655
AND THE CHIMNEY GUY'S
NAME'S UNDER "O"--

12:23.655 --> 12:25.309
ORSON CHIMNEY REPAIR.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.834
ORSON...OK.
I'M RIGHT ON TOP
OF IT, MAN.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.750
AND YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR PRESCRIPTION RIGHT
AFTER I DROP OWEN OFF.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.056
HEY, YOU WANT ME TO
STOP AT THE VIDEO STORE,
PICK YOU SOMETHING UP?

12:33.056 --> 12:34.928
NO, THANKS, JULIA.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.843
I PICKED UP A COPY
OF THE NEW GREEN DAY
CD FOR YOU,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.670
IF YOU WANNA TAKE
A LISTEN TO IT.

12:38.670 --> 12:39.889
THAT'S OK, BAY.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.238
IF YOU'RE
UP FOR A RIDE,

12:41.238 --> 12:42.718
GRIFFIN'S GOING
OUT TO PIEDMONT

12:42.718 --> 12:43.763
TO PICK UP A PART
THIS AFTERNOON.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.851
I'VE GOT
MY TREATMENT.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.201
WELL, MAYBE
AFTER THAT.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.377
AFTER THAT, I PLAN
ON GETTING THE SLEEP THAT
I'M NOT GETTING RIGHT NOW,

12:49.377 --> 12:50.770
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.121
GOD, WHAT IS
THAT SMELL?

12:54.121 --> 12:56.732
THE BATHROOM'S GROTIE.
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO CLEAN IT YET,

12:56.732 --> 12:58.647
BUT RIGHT AFTER
I COME BACK FROM
THE DRUG STORE.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.127
Claudia:
POPCORN'S READY!

13:00.127 --> 13:02.738
HE'S EATING POPCORN?
FOR BREAKFAST?

13:02.738 --> 13:04.522
HEY, IT'S WHITE.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.573
ANYTIME YOU
WANNA LEAVE, MAN.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.905
HEY.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.821
LISTEN, UH...
DO YOU THINK...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.213
COULD WE TALK?

13:43.213 --> 13:46.260
SURE. SURE.
I'VE BEEN--

13:46.260 --> 13:49.045
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY
ALL DAY.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.048
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S MY FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?

13:52.048 --> 13:55.486
IT'S REALLY BAD
OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.619
REALLY?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.839
IT'S LIKE--

13:59.839 --> 14:04.060
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN'T
GET AWAY FROM THE
CANCER, YOU KNOW?

14:04.060 --> 14:06.889
THE KITCHEN'S
FULL OF FOOD
HE CAN'T EAT.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.848
THE LIVING ROOM'S
WHERE HE SITS DOWN

14:08.848 --> 14:10.850
AND WATCHES TV
ALL DAY.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.895
THE BATHROOM'S WHERE
HE...WELL, YOU KNOW.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.679
MAN.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.899
THAT'S WHY, I MEAN--

14:16.899 --> 14:19.249
HOMEWORK,
DENTAL WORK--

14:19.249 --> 14:21.686
I'D RATHER BE DOING
ANYTHING WITH YOU

14:21.686 --> 14:24.037
THAN BE AT HOME
RIGHT NOW.

14:24.037 --> 14:27.040
YOU'RE LIKE
THE ONE THING I HAVE

14:27.040 --> 14:29.651
THAT FEELS GOOD
RIGHT NOW.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.830
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU
SAYING BEFORE?

14:34.830 --> 14:37.789
WHAT? OH...NOTHING.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.580
HEY, CHARLIE.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.148
SARAH.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.280
HEY, LISTEN, I DON'T
MEAN TO BOTHER YOU--

14:50.280 --> 14:51.716
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR JULIA,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.283
SHE'S OUT RUNNING
ERRANDS.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.503
NO. UM, SEE, I HAVE
TO DO THIS PROJECT

14:55.503 --> 14:57.113
FOR MY THEATER
PRODUCTION CLASS.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.333
I HAVE TO BUILD
A SCALE MODEL
OF A PROSCENIUM.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
BAILEY SAID
YOU HAVE THIS
DRAFTING TABLE,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.119
AND I JUST THOUGHT
IF I COULD FIND IT--

15:03.119 --> 15:05.513
YOU KNOW, I--
I DON'T NEED THIS.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.732
I REALLY
DON'T NEED THIS.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.778
I MEAN, BETWEEN
BAILEY AND JULIA

15:09.778 --> 15:12.128
BUGGING ME
WITH EVERY TINY
LITTLE PROBLEM,

15:12.128 --> 15:14.522
AND CLAUDIA
STINKING UP
THE PLACE

15:14.522 --> 15:16.524
WITH HER
MICROWAVE POPCORN...

15:16.524 --> 15:18.743
AND NOW,
HE'S SENDING
YOU OVER HERE

15:18.743 --> 15:20.441
TO ENTERTAIN ME
OR SOMETHING?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.138
BECAUSE I CAN
ACTUALLY DRAG MYSELF

15:22.138 --> 15:24.140
OVER TO
THE BOOKSHELF
IF I'M BORED.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.751
I DON'T NEED
ANYONE SENDING
YOU OVER HERE

15:26.751 --> 15:30.886
WITH SOME LAME STORY
ABOUT A DESIGN
PROJECT! OK?

15:32.105 --> 15:33.933
UH, I WAS
JUST WONDERING

15:33.933 --> 15:35.804
WHERE YOUR
DRAFTING TABLE WAS.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.983
THAT'S ALL.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.379
EXCUSE ME, SIR...
YES?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.947
I'M SURE THERE'S
A VERY GOOD REASON
FOR THIS,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.905
BUT AREN'T
THOSE TABLES
EMPTY OVER THERE?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.951
YES, THEY ARE,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.996
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE SHORT-STAFFED
AT THE MOMENT...

15:53.996 --> 15:55.780
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.782
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU? YOU ARE
40 MINUTES LATE.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.872
I HAD TO WAIT
HALF AN HOUR FOR
CHARLIE'S PRESCRIPTION--

16:00.872 --> 16:02.613
YEAH? YOU MISSED
THE MEETING
I CALLED,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.180
SO NOW YOU
WON'T KNOW ANY OF
THE NEW CODES.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.052
LOOK, I'M
REALLY SORRY, OK?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.054
I'LL STAY LATE,
AND I'LL DO SETTINGS--

16:08.054 --> 16:09.664
WHY IS MERCY
ON MY STATION?

16:09.664 --> 16:12.101
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT
I THOUGHT TABLE ONE

16:12.101 --> 16:13.407
OUGHT TO HAVE
A LITTLE SERVICE.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.322
WELL, YOU CAN
TAKE HER OFF NOW.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.411
SHE'S BEEN ON THAT TABLE
ALMOST AN HOUR.
IT'S HERS NOW

16:17.411 --> 16:19.717
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO, LEAVE OWEN AT
DAYCARE ALL NIGHT

16:19.717 --> 16:22.155
AND NOT BUY TOILET PAPER
WHEN WE'RE OUT?

16:22.155 --> 16:23.852
NO, BUT YOU
COULD'VE PLANNED
A LITTLE BETTER

16:23.852 --> 16:25.810
SO YOU COULD'VE
BEEN HERE ON TIME.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.944
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MONEY
TO GET GRIFFIN AND I
OUT OF HAWK.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.165
AND IN CASE YOU FORGOT,
THE ONLY REASON YOU GET
TO RUN THIS PLACE

16:32.165 --> 16:36.343
IS BECAUSE I'M TAKING
CARE OF EVERYTHING
AT THAT HOUSE.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.215
OK...OK.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.913
MERCY, I GOTTA
CUT HER SOME SLACK
ON THIS,

16:41.913 --> 16:43.089
SO IF YOU
WOULDN'T MIND--

16:43.089 --> 16:44.525
FINE. GREAT.
THANKS A LOT.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.396
WAIT, MERCY, PLEASE.

16:51.227 --> 16:56.450
NO FAIR. YOU CAN'T
HIDE BEHIND THOSE
ROBOTRON THINGIES.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.930
GO AHEAD.
TAKE YOUR BEST
SHOT, SALINGER.

17:00.497 --> 17:03.065
HA HA! TAKE THAT.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.111
UGH. I CUT YOU
IN HALF.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.504
WOW, ARE THOSE
YOUR INTESTINES?

17:07.504 --> 17:09.593
I AM VERY,
VERY DEAD.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.946
OH, THAT WAS GREAT.
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.037
MAYBE LATER.
MY THUMBS ARE TOAST.

17:19.516 --> 17:24.434
[SIGHS] SO,
WHAT'S UP AT HOME?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.088
ARE THINGS ANY BETTER?

17:26.088 --> 17:30.701
YOU KNOW WHAT?
COULD WE NOT?

17:30.701 --> 17:34.096
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
NICE OF YOU TO ASK
AND EVERYTHING,

17:34.096 --> 17:37.056
BUT LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THAT TONIGHT.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.970
SURE. NO PROBLEM.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.244
I GOT AN IDEA.
SCREW MY THUMBS.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.115
LET'S PLAY ANOTHER GAME.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.814
YES. THIS IS
SALINGER'S,

17:56.814 --> 18:00.122
CALLING TO CONFIRM
YOUR 8:00 RESERVATION
FOR TONIGHT.

18:00.122 --> 18:04.344
YOU'RE NOT?
WELL, I'M GLAD
I CALLED, TOO.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.563
JEFF, THOSE GO
IN THE FRIDGE.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.652
WELL, WE HOPE
TO SEE YOU SOON.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.871
OK, THANKS.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.221
OK, SHRIMP SALAD
FOR THE LADY--

18:12.221 --> 18:14.397
I DIDN'T ORDER
SHRIMP.

18:14.397 --> 18:17.139
OH, YOU DIDN'T?
ARE YOU SURE?

18:17.139 --> 18:20.229
I THINK I'D REMEMBER
IF I ORDERED SOMETHING
I'M ALLERGIC TO.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.231
YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO SHRIMP?
GOD, ME, TOO.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.928
I PUFF UP LIKE
A BEACH BALL.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.582
UH, THAT'S
MY SHRIMP.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.584
I'VE BEEN WAITING
A HALF AN HOUR
FOR IT.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.065
OH...I'M SORRY.

18:30.065 --> 18:33.068
I'LL GET THIS
STRAIGHTENED OUT
RIGHT AWAY.

18:33.068 --> 18:36.593
JULIA, WHY AREN'T YOU
USING THE NEW SYSTEM?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.160
YOU'RE GETTING HALF
YOUR ORDERS WRONG.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.727
I DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE TO
LEARN IT, OK?

18:39.727 --> 18:41.816
I MADE IT
VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.339
I WROTE ALL THE CODES
OUT ON THE BACK
OF YOUR PAD.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.953
LOOK, ALL
THE OTHER WAITERS SAY
THAT IT HELPS THEM.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.955
PEOPLE ARE
STILL GETTING
THEIR FOOD, OK?

18:50.955 --> 18:52.957
YEAH, AT ALL DIFFERENT
TIMES AND PRICES.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.568
I'VE BEEN READING
YOUR CHECKS.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.613
SO, IF YOU WOULD
JUST USE THE CODES--

18:56.613 --> 18:58.963
WHAT IS WITH YOU
AND THESE STUPID
DAMN CODES?

18:58.963 --> 19:01.183
GOD, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS STILL
CHARLIE'S PLACE.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.880
YOU'RE JUST
FILLING IN.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.056
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CHANGE
STUFF AROUND

19:05.056 --> 19:07.494
JUST TO PROVE
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING,

19:07.494 --> 19:09.757
AND IF YOU CAN'T
RUN IT LIKE HE CAN,
NOBODY CARES,

19:09.757 --> 19:11.628
SO JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE!

20:03.027 --> 20:05.029
TV: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO

20:05.029 --> 20:06.901
IF ANYTHING EVER
HAPPENED TO YOU.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.648
SALINGER?

20:17.607 --> 20:19.479
ARE YOU PASSED OUT?

20:22.003 --> 20:24.701
HEY...YOU TOTALLY GONE?

20:29.010 --> 20:31.665
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANNA GO HOME?

21:12.314 --> 21:15.839
OH...HEY...
YOU'RE HOME.

21:17.928 --> 21:21.802
HALLELUJAH.
MY DAY IS OVER.

21:21.802 --> 21:24.761
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THIS SIDE?
IT'S ALREADY WARM.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.981
I'M TOO WARM
ALREADY.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.592
I JUST DID A DAY'S
WORTH OF DISHES.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.986
OH, WELL, WANT ME
TO OPEN A WINDOW?

21:31.986 --> 21:34.989
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE SOME OF THESE
CLOTHES OFF.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.383
OR HOW ABOUT I TAKE
THEM OFF FOR YOU?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.776
WHAT FOR, SO WE
CAN HAVE SEX?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.125
GRIFFIN, GOD...

21:41.125 --> 21:43.606
OK, NEVER MIND.

21:43.606 --> 21:47.175
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T FEEL
VERY SEXY RIGHT NOW.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.090
ALL RIGHT. IT'S OK.
NO PROBLEM.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.397
I KNOW IT HAS
TO BE DONE,

21:51.397 --> 21:56.053
BUT ALL DAY LONG, I'M
TAKING CARE OF CHARLIE
AND CLAUDIA AND OWEN,

21:56.053 --> 22:00.710
AND ALL NIGHT LONG,
I'M SLAVING FOR
SOME LOUSY TIPPERS.

22:00.710 --> 22:05.280
YOU KNOW, NO ONE
EVER ASKS ME
WHAT I WANT.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.979
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
I DO HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.330
[SIGHS]

22:13.723 --> 22:17.118
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
THAT CRAP WORKS
FOR CINDERELLA,

22:17.118 --> 22:21.949
BUT FOR ME, I JUST
WANT TO CRAWL INTO BED
AND NEVER WAKE UP.

22:23.690 --> 22:24.995
[SIGHS]

22:58.507 --> 23:00.030
[FOOTSTEPS]

23:00.030 --> 23:01.945
OH, HELLO.

23:03.947 --> 23:04.905
GOOD MORNING.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.689
MORNING.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.127
HOW'D YOU SLEEP
LAST NIGHT?

23:10.127 --> 23:12.826
A LITTLE.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.958
YOU?

23:14.958 --> 23:17.308
I SLEPT GREAT,
IF YOU WANNA KNOW.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.226
WEREN'T YOU WEARING
THAT YESTERDAY?

23:22.226 --> 23:24.098
YEAH.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.012
SO?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.102
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:28.102 --> 23:31.148
WHY WERE YOU OUT
AT 7:00 IN THE--

23:33.150 --> 23:35.326
WHERE DID YOU SLEEP
LAST NIGHT? DID YOU--

23:35.326 --> 23:36.893
I SLEPT OVER AT REED'S.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.765
YOU WHAT? CLAUDIA--

23:38.765 --> 23:41.985
OK, FINE. IF YOU WANT
TO YELL AT ME, JUST...

23:41.985 --> 23:43.247
JUST--JUST GO AHEAD.

23:43.247 --> 23:46.033
I'VE GOT TO GET
TO MY TREATMENT.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.470
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

23:48.470 --> 23:51.125
LOOK, IT WAS
A STUPID MOVE,
OK, CLAUD,

23:51.125 --> 23:52.996
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

23:55.085 --> 24:00.090
D-DON'T YOU EVEN
WANT TO KNOW IF WE SLEPT
IN SEPARATE BEDS?

24:00.090 --> 24:02.005
OK, I BROKE IT DOWN
INTO CATEGORIES--

24:02.005 --> 24:03.920
ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING,
EMERGENCIES AND
NOT-SO EMERGENCIES.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.619
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO LOOK AT THIS
RIGHT NOW, SARAH.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.055
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT, BAILEY.

24:08.055 --> 24:10.013
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
BURIED RIGHT NOW, BUT--

24:10.013 --> 24:12.146
[TELEPHONE RINGS]DON'T GET THAT.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.843
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
ANOTHER CRISIS.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.845
OK. YESTERDAY WHEN
THE CABLE WENT OUT,

24:15.845 --> 24:17.412
THEY WERE CHANTING
YOUR NAME...

24:17.412 --> 24:19.196
IN A NOT-GOOD WAY.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.938
Answering Machine:
BAILEY, IT'S JULIA.
PICK UP.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.636
PICK IT UP.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.333
HEY.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.161
I JUST CALLED
THE RESTAURANT
FOR MY SCHEDULE.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.858
LOOK, I WAS
GONNA CALL YOU.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.860
YOU TOOK ME OFF
THE BANCROFT TABLES.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.993
I MEAN,
YOU ACTUALLY DID THAT?

24:32.993 --> 24:35.474
THOSE TABLES
ARE WORTH MORE TO US THAN
ANY OTHER TABLES ALL YEAR.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.389
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I'M GONNA PUT
MY NEWEST WAITRESS ON THEM

24:38.389 --> 24:39.782
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S MY SISTER?

24:39.782 --> 24:41.262
BAILEY, ALL YOU
HAVE BEEN DOING

24:41.262 --> 24:42.872
IS JERKING ME AROUND
FROM TABLE TO TABLE.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.570
I'M TRYING TO RUN
THE RESTAURANT, JULIA.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.136
REALLY? OH, REALLY?

24:46.136 --> 24:47.877
WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT
CHARLIE SAYS ABOUT THAT.

24:47.877 --> 24:48.748
JULIA--

24:49.966 --> 24:50.837
HELLO?

24:52.839 --> 24:55.798
ARE YOU STILL
GOING BY THE HOUSE
BEFORE SCHOOL?

24:55.798 --> 24:56.799
YEAH. WHY?

24:56.799 --> 24:57.844
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.511
HOW'D IT GO?
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

25:15.383 --> 25:16.993
NOT GREAT.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.039
LOOK, CHARLIE, I HATE
TO BUG YOU ABOUT THIS

25:19.039 --> 25:20.301
AFTER YOUR TREATMENT,
BUT--

25:20.301 --> 25:21.911
CAN WE PLEASE
DO THIS LATER?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.913
BAILEY TOOK ME OFF
THE BANCROFT TABLES.

25:23.913 --> 25:27.177
HE JUST--HE REARRANGED
THE ENTIRE SHIFT
AT THE VERY LAST SECOND,

25:27.177 --> 25:30.137
LIKE, TOTALLY
ARBITRARILY
AND JUST TO SPITE ME.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.095
Bailey: CHARLIE!
WHERE ARE YOU?!

25:32.095 --> 25:34.010
IN HERE, BAILEY.

25:34.010 --> 25:37.013
COME ON BACK.
I'LL THROW UP
ON BOTH OF YOU.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.712
OK, WHATEVER SHE
TOLD YOU, YOU GOTTA HEAR
MY SIDE OF IT FIRST.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.148
GOOD, I'D LIKE
TO HEAR IT, TOO.

25:41.148 --> 25:42.932
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA...

25:42.932 --> 25:43.933
WHATEVER...

25:43.933 --> 25:45.935
DOWNSTAIRS.

25:45.935 --> 25:49.199
LOOK, YOU KNOW HOW ANAL
THIS BANCROFT GUY IS,
RIGHT?

25:49.199 --> 25:50.636
IT'S JUST
SERVING PLATES,

25:50.636 --> 25:53.116
AND THE MENU IS PRESET.GUYS, PLEASE.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.031
YEAH, WELL, YOU FOUND PLENTY
OF WAYS TO SCREW UP LAST NIGHT.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.337
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.
I MADE LIKE 2 MISTAKES.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.121
WILL YOU JUST--

25:58.121 --> 25:59.775
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU STILL HAVE
A 4-TABLE STATION,

25:59.775 --> 26:01.037
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.299
THAT MAKES ONLY
HALF THE AMOUNT, BAILEY.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.692
SHUT UP!

26:03.692 --> 26:07.174
WILL YOU BOTH
JUST SHUT UP?!

26:07.174 --> 26:09.306
WHY ARE YOU DRAGGING
ME INTO THIS NOW?

26:09.306 --> 26:12.745
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS STUFF.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.921
I FEEL LIKE CRAP,
AND I'M EXHAUSTED.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.705
I KNOW. I KNOW THAT,
CHARLIE,

26:16.705 --> 26:18.968
AND IF YOU WOULD
JUST BACK ME UP
ON THIS ONE THING--

26:18.968 --> 26:21.884
NO. NO. WORK IT OUT
YOURSELVES, BOTH OF YOU.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.973
JUST GROW UP
AND DO YOUR JOBS.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.410
I'M TRYING
TO DO MY JOB, BUT
SHE WON'T LISTEN.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.022
YOU'RE THE MANAGER,
BAILEY. YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING, DO IT.

26:29.022 --> 26:32.068
AND YOU, YOU SHOULD
STOP WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT TABLES YOU'RE GETTING

26:32.068 --> 26:35.419
AND START WORRYING
ABOUT WHY YOUR SISTER
DIDN'T STAY HERE LAST NIGHT.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.160
WHAT? SHE DIDN'T--

26:37.160 --> 26:38.640
SHE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT REED'S.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.120
DID YOU EVEN KNOW THAT?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.165
OH, GOD, CHARLIE.
I DID--I DIDN'T--

26:42.165 --> 26:43.993
JUST SAVE IT, OK?

26:43.993 --> 26:45.604
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.475
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ANOTHER THING.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.615
OH, YOU ALREADY--

26:56.615 --> 26:59.226
YOU CHANGED IT
ALL AROUND.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.228
YEAH, I KNOW.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.317
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I JUST, UM...

27:03.317 --> 27:06.973
I CAME DOWN HERE,
AND I SAW WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, AND...

27:06.973 --> 27:09.018
I KIND OF HAD
A FEW IDEAS.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.281
CHARLIE, YOU CHANGED
THE WHOLE DESIGN.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.501
I KNOW.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.459
BUT SEE...

27:15.459 --> 27:17.418
IT KIND OF WASN'T
WORKING, SARAH.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.462
IT WHAT?

27:18.462 --> 27:20.029
I MEAN, AS A MODEL, YEAH,

27:20.029 --> 27:22.771
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY
TRIED TO BUILD THE THING

27:22.771 --> 27:26.166
WITH ALL THOSE--THOSE
UNBRACED LOAD-BEARING WALLS,

27:26.166 --> 27:29.038
YOU'D--YOU'D
BURY YOUR AUDIENCE
UNDER RUBBLE.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.649
OH.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.087
WELL, THANKS.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.263
BUT I CAN CHANGE IT BACK
IF YOU WANT.

27:36.263 --> 27:38.091
NO. NO,
DON'T DO THAT.

27:38.091 --> 27:41.094
WOULDN'T WANT
TO KILL ANYONE.

27:41.094 --> 27:44.445
SO IS THAT WHY YOU MOVED
THE STAGE BACK HERE,

27:44.445 --> 27:45.576
I MEAN,
TO MAKE IT SAFER?

27:45.576 --> 27:48.536
NO. ACTUALLY...

27:48.536 --> 27:51.191
I DID THAT
FOR SIGHTLINES.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.802
SEE, IF YOU LOOK
AT IT FROM HERE...

27:53.802 --> 27:56.239
OH. SO IF YOU
WIDEN THE WINGS...

27:56.239 --> 27:59.242
EXACTLY. IT
MAKES THE STAGE FEEL
DEEPER THAN IT IS.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.029
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

28:04.944 --> 28:08.730
CLAUD, COULD YOU--
CAN WE TALK
FOR A SECOND?

28:08.730 --> 28:11.559
LOOK, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE KEEPING THINGS

28:11.559 --> 28:14.823
UNDER CONTROL
AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW,
YOU KNOW, AND, UH...

28:14.823 --> 28:18.261
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT
STUFF GOING ON,
I SORT OF CAN'T.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.307
I'M SORT OF DESPERATE.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.526
YEAH?

28:22.526 --> 28:25.138
I NEED YOUR HELP, CLAUD.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.922
LIKE, FOR STARTERS,

28:26.922 --> 28:30.491
I NEED YOU
NOT TO SLEEP OVER
AT A BOY'S HOUSE

28:30.491 --> 28:31.927
WITHOUT TELLING
SOMEONE FIRST.

28:31.927 --> 28:34.277
WHO AM I
SUPPOSED TO TELL?

28:34.277 --> 28:37.324
YOU'RE NEVER AROUND,
AND CHARLIE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE BOTHERED.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.021
WELL, I'M HERE NOW.

28:41.328 --> 28:45.114
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
I'M HAVING COFFEE
WITH REED TONIGHT.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.856
TONIGHT?

28:47.856 --> 28:50.119
TONIGHT? WELL,
THEN WHO'S GONNA
LOOK AFTER OWEN?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.294
HOW AM
I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

28:51.294 --> 28:52.556
CLAUDIA, WOULD
YOU CUT IT OUT?

28:52.556 --> 28:54.254
I JUST FINISHED
TELLING YOU--

28:54.254 --> 28:56.343
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE TROUBLE
HERE, JULIA.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.692
I'M NOT, BUT...

28:57.692 --> 28:59.912
BUT I HAPPEN
TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

28:59.912 --> 29:01.870
AND--AND
WE HAVE A DATE.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.916
IF YOU WANTED SOMEONE
TO WATCH OWEN,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.613
Y-YOU SHOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING SOONER.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.746
I JUST--I CAN'T
HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.

29:18.539 --> 29:19.975
YES, SIR?

29:19.975 --> 29:22.064
I HOPE THIS FISH KNIFE
DOESN'T MEAN

29:22.064 --> 29:23.631
THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
OUR SECOND COURSE.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.938
NO, SIR. THAT SILVER
WILL COME WITH THE MEAL.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.809
YOU HAVEN'T
TRIED THE VEAL?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.811
YOU'RE SERVING FOOD
YOU NEVER TRIED?

29:29.811 --> 29:32.683
IT'S A DAILY
SPECIAL, OK,
AND I'M NEW HERE.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.862
SO DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT?

29:36.862 --> 29:38.994
AND THE PINOT
YOU'RE SERVING,

29:38.994 --> 29:42.084
IT'S CUVEE ISABELLE,
NOT THE SANFORD?

29:42.084 --> 29:44.695
YES, SIR. CHARLIE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.480

AND I HAVE OTHER TABLES.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.485
OH.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.748
WELL, DON'T LET US
GET IN YOUR WAY.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.228
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.970
BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE TO STAY.

29:57.970 --> 30:01.016
THE CHICKEN WILL BE
SAUTEED IN OLIVE OIL,
NOT BUTTER?

30:01.016 --> 30:01.887
THAT'S...

30:04.454 --> 30:05.760
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.460
OK, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KNOW HOW THE VEAL IS?

30:10.460 --> 30:13.724
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GO BACK THERE AND
TASTE IT FOR YOU NOW?

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
YES, I THINK I WOULD.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.757
HAVE YOU CHECKED IN THE FRIDGE?YES.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.759
HAVE YOU CHECKED IN THE OFFICE?UH-HUH.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.326
HAVE YOU CHECKED
IN THE TRUCK?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.937
IN THE BASEMENT?
IN THE LAUNDRY?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.634
HAVE YOU CHECKED
IN THE TRASH?

30:53.634 --> 30:55.636
WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH
FOR 5 MORE DESSERTS.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.203
THAT CAN'T BE.
IT CAN'T BE.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.248
AND THEN NO MORE BANANAS,
NO MORE FOSTER.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.033
BUT WE WERE
DOING SO WELL.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.338
WE WERE ALMOST
HOME FREE.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.210
JUST TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.473
JUST--JUST TELL HIM
TO PICK WHATEVER ELSE
HE WANTS.

31:06.473 --> 31:07.822
HAVE YOU EVEN
MET THIS GUY?

31:07.822 --> 31:08.997
NOTHING
IS WHAT HE WANTS.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.912
NOTHING
MAKES HIM HAPPY.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.828
NOTHING IS WHAT HE--

31:13.828 --> 31:17.310
HEY! YOU, WITH
THE BANANAS, FREEZE!

31:17.310 --> 31:20.922
MR. BANCROFT,
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR JUST A MOMENT?

31:20.922 --> 31:23.098
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
DURING DINNER, SIR,

31:23.098 --> 31:24.708
BUT I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A MOMENT
ABOUT DESSERT.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.101
YES.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.581
YOU ORDERED
THE BANANAS FOSTER,

31:27.581 --> 31:29.191
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A GREAT DESSERT.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.367
IT'S ONE OF OUR BEST.YES.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.892
HOWEVER, THAT'S
WHAT EVERYONE ORDERS.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.637
AH, JUST A SECOND.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.900
WHAT ARE THOSE?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.118
PERFECT.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.554
OH, THOSE.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.034
THOSE ARE CHERIMOYAS

31:46.034 --> 31:47.862
FLOWN IN FRESH
FROM GUADALAJARA.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.385
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THEM BEFORE.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.821
WELL, THEY'RE PRETTY RARE.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.085
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO TRY THEM, I--I...

31:53.085 --> 31:55.391
I MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH
FOR YOU AND YOUR PARTY.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.611
UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE SAFE ROUTE

31:57.611 --> 31:59.047
BACK TO THE BANANAS.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.880
WE'LL HAVE
THE FOREIGN FRUIT.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.751
YES, SIR.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.104
Julia:
WHAT IS THIS, A JOKE?

32:12.104 --> 32:13.714
Diner: NOPE,
NOT AT ALL.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.629
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY TIP?

32:15.629 --> 32:17.457
IT'S WHAT
YOU DESERVE.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.242
FOR SERVING JERKS
LIKE YOU, I DESERVE
A TRIP TO FIJI.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.896
I DESERVE
A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
I DESERVE--

32:21.896 --> 32:24.420
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

32:24.420 --> 32:27.641
THEY GAVE ME
5 BUCKS IN CHANGE
ON A $100 CHECK.

32:27.641 --> 32:31.166
OK. DO YOU THINK
MAYBE WE COULD SETTLE THIS
WITHOUT YELLING?

32:31.166 --> 32:32.646
YOU WANT IT SETTLED?
HERE.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.695
GREAT WORK TONIGHT.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.653
GOOD WORK. THANKS.

32:41.437 --> 32:42.743
GREAT NIGHT.
THANK YOU.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.749
[EXHALES]

32:51.882 --> 32:54.450
NAPPING ON THE JOB,
ARE WE?

32:54.450 --> 32:57.410
MR. BANCROFT, I DIDN'T
SEE YOU COME IN.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.542
UH, WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.630
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.371
LET ME GIVE YOU
A TIP, SALINGER.

33:02.371 --> 33:04.852
LOSE THE BOWING
AND SCRAPING, ALL RIGHT?

33:06.288 --> 33:08.856
LOOK, UH, I'LL ADMIT IT.

33:08.856 --> 33:13.817
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WAS
A CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT,

33:13.817 --> 33:15.254
BUT YOU DID ALL RIGHT.

33:17.212 --> 33:21.782
ANYWAY, BEFORE THOSE LEECHES
RAISE MY BAR TAB ANY HIGHER,

33:21.782 --> 33:24.306
FOR YOU AND THE STAFF.

33:30.834 --> 33:31.748
SIR...

33:34.099 --> 33:35.448
THANK YOU, SIR.

33:35.448 --> 33:38.494
BRACE YOURSELVES
FOR NEXT YEAR.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.025
WOW. IS THAT 500 BUCKS?

33:51.377 --> 33:53.770
YOU GONNA PUT IT
IN THE POOL?

33:53.770 --> 33:57.731
YEAH, COURSE I AM.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.777
SO, YOU MUST
BE HAPPY, HUH?

34:00.777 --> 34:02.344
YOU ACTUALLY
PULLED IT OFF.

34:02.344 --> 34:03.215
YEAH.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.045
[SIGHS]

34:08.916 --> 34:10.135
YOU'RE FIRED, JULE.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.484
WHAT?

34:12.963 --> 34:14.661
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

34:14.661 --> 34:16.750
NO, I'M NOT.

34:16.750 --> 34:20.319
LOOK, I HATE
TO SAY THIS, BUT YOU'RE
NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.711
YOU'RE FORGETFUL.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.322
YOU'RE RUDE.
YOU'RE IMPATIENT.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.932
WHAT, THOSE GUYS
WITH THE TIP?
THEY WERE JERKS.

34:24.932 --> 34:26.455
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
LIKE THAT AROUND HERE.

34:26.455 --> 34:27.717
I DID US A FAVOR.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.849
IT'S NOT JUST
THEM, JULIA.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.503
OK, SO I MAKE
A FEW MISTAKES.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.070
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO LEARN.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.333
YOU DON'T WANT TO LEARN.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.379
FACE IT, JULIA.
YOU--YOU HATE THIS JOB.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.728
PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.513
CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.213
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T LOOK SO SMUG, OK?

34:45.213 --> 34:49.087
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS JOB,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN...

34:49.087 --> 34:51.132
BAILEY, THIS IS
DIFFERENT FOR ME, OK?

34:51.132 --> 34:54.092
'CAUSE IF I--
I HATE IT HERE OR NOT,

34:54.092 --> 34:57.051
IF I'M
GOOD AT IT OR NOT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.967
I HAVE TO BE HERE.
I HAVE TO DO THIS,
BAILEY.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.059
WELL, PLEASE
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG

35:05.059 --> 35:06.800
PUTTING THAT GIANT TIP
IN THE POOL,

35:06.800 --> 35:08.845
BECAUSE WHATEVER
SMALL FRACTION
OF IT IS MINE,

35:08.845 --> 35:09.759
I NEED IT.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.379
DID YOU TELL HIM
EVERYTHING

35:20.379 --> 35:21.771
THAT YOU BEEN
GOING THROUGH
WITH OWEN, HUH,

35:21.771 --> 35:23.425
AND ALL THIS
CHARLIE STUFF

35:23.425 --> 35:25.079
AND THE NIGHTMARE
TREE-BRANCH INSURANCE THING?

35:25.079 --> 35:26.428
HE KNOWS ALL OF THAT,
GRIFFIN.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.821
AND HE FIRED YOU ANYWAY?

35:27.821 --> 35:28.865
UH-HUH.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.129
HOW CAN HE DO THAT?

35:31.129 --> 35:34.175
I MEAN, YOU'RE
COOKING AND CLEANING
FOR THE WHOLE DAMN HOUSE,

35:34.175 --> 35:35.394
AND YOU'RE--
YOU'RE CLEANING UP
YOUR BROTHER'S VOMIT.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.178
GRIFFIN, STOP IT, OK?

35:37.178 --> 35:38.571
YOU'RE
DEPRESSING ME HERE.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.529
IT'S, UH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.096
YEAH. WELL,
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

35:42.096 --> 35:43.358
IT'S DONE.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.794
NO, NO, NO.
NO, IT'S NOT.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.535
NO, HE CAN GIVE YOU
YOUR JOB BACK.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.537
WHAT FOR?
I DON'T WANT IT.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.930
YOU DON'T?

35:49.930 --> 35:51.018
WHAT? BUT I--I THOUGHT--

35:51.018 --> 35:53.194
WHAT IS THE POINT?

35:53.194 --> 35:55.457
BAILEY WAS RIGHT.
I HATED THAT JOB.

35:55.457 --> 35:58.243
AND, I MEAN, YEAH,
THE REST OF WHAT I DO
EVERY DAY

35:58.243 --> 35:59.809
IS JUST AS BAD,

35:59.809 --> 36:02.160
BUT AT LEAST IT'S
ONE LESS THING TO HATE.

36:06.816 --> 36:09.384
NO. TELL THEM SORRY'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.430
EVERY DAY
WE'RE MISSING LINENS,

36:11.430 --> 36:14.215
AND IT'S NOT
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
CHEAPER OPTIONS.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.521
RIGHT.

36:15.521 --> 36:17.392
YEAH. I'LL GET
INTO IT LATER.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.223
OK.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.791
HERE WE ARE.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.140
THIS LOOKS GREAT.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.142
OK, I'M SORRY.
WHERE WERE WE?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.144
UH, YOU WERE TELLING
ME WHAT HAPPENED

36:30.144 --> 36:31.841
WHEN THE SOUS-CHEF
TRIED TO QUIT.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.191
I WAS?

36:33.191 --> 36:34.757
ENOUGH ABOUT
THAT STUPID RESTAURANT.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.368
TELL ME ABOUT
YOU AND NAT.

36:36.368 --> 36:39.066
I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU GUYS FOR DAYS.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.981
NAT'S GREAT.
I HAD SOME INTERVIEWS.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.461
BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.463
I MEAN, NOW FINISH
YOUR STORY.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.899
OK. OK.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.901
IT WASN'T
ANY BIG DEAL, REALLY,

36:47.901 --> 36:49.903
BUT HE THREATENED
TO WALK OUT,

36:49.903 --> 36:52.862
SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE
AND I DIALED 911.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.952
YOU CALLED THE COPS?AMBULANCE. I TOLD THEM

36:55.952 --> 36:58.912
THEY WERE EITHER
GOING TO BE PICKING UP
PHILIP OR ME,

36:58.912 --> 37:01.436
SO HE DECIDED TO STAY
AND FINISH THE CHICKEN.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.438
MAN, BAILEY,
YOU HAVE THE MOVES.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.527
I MEAN, YOU ARE
A TOTAL OPERATOR.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.095
NO, I'M NOT.
I ALMOST GOT KILLED.

37:08.095 --> 37:10.271
YOU SHOULD SEE THAT GUY
WITH A FILLET KNIFE.

37:10.271 --> 37:14.014
WELL, YOU SAID THAT
IT WAS THE HIGHEST
GROSSING NIGHT EVER.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.364
WELL...

37:16.364 --> 37:17.496
THAT'S TRUE.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.544
CHARLIE MUST BE
SO RELIEVED.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.593
I DON'T KNOW.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.552
I HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED TO HIM.

37:30.552 --> 37:33.947
WELL, IT'S JUST,
I MEAN, HE CAN
FINALLY RELAX NOW.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.906
YOU CAN SWING IT
WITHOUT HIM, YOU KNOW?

37:36.906 --> 37:38.734
YEAH.

37:38.734 --> 37:39.909
I GUESS SO.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.573
CHARLIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:51.573 --> 37:53.140
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.838
WE ARE.
WE ARE.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.450
I JUST, UH...
TAKE A LOOK.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.321
I KNOW WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT THIS,

38:00.321 --> 38:02.715
AND THERE'S
NO STRUCTURAL NEED
FOR IT WHATSOEVER,

38:02.715 --> 38:04.760
BUT, UH, ALL MY LIFE

38:04.760 --> 38:07.894
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD
A FLYING BALCONY, SO...

38:07.894 --> 38:09.635
HEH HEH.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.638
YOU MUST GET
PRETTY BORED AROUND HERE
SOMETIMES, HUH?

38:12.638 --> 38:15.815
ACTUALLY...

38:15.815 --> 38:19.297
I REMEMBER THIS
ONE PROJECT IN, UH,
IN DESIGN SCHOOL,

38:19.297 --> 38:23.736
AND MY CLASS
DIVVIED UP THIS--
THIS OFFICE COMPLEX,

38:23.736 --> 38:26.391
AND I PULLED THE--
THE PARKING STRUCTURE.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.870
BUT IT WAS GREAT,

38:27.870 --> 38:31.178
I MEAN, VISUALIZING ALL
THOSE LEVELS AND RAMPS.

38:31.178 --> 38:33.746
I SWEAR I WAS GONNA
REVOLUTIONIZE THE ART

38:33.746 --> 38:35.922
OF PARKING-SPACE
DISTRIBUTION. HEH HEH.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.924
THEN, UH...

38:37.924 --> 38:42.363
JOE CALLED WITH
SOME PERSONAL CRISIS
AT THE RESTAURANT...

38:42.363 --> 38:45.148
AND THAT WAS IT
FOR ME AND THAT CLASS.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.935
WOW. I'M SORRY.

38:50.589 --> 38:51.851
YEAH.

38:51.851 --> 38:52.895
ME, TOO.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.341
HI.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.820
HI.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.822
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

39:06.822 --> 39:10.478
I MEAN, I WENT
TO THE COFFEE HOUSE,
BUT YOU NEVER CAME.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.872
OH. I WAS OUT
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.613
BUT I THOUGHT
WE HAD PLANS.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.832
YOU DID?

39:16.832 --> 39:20.053
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
WE SAID MAYBE WE WOULD
OR MAYBE WE WOULDN'T.

39:20.053 --> 39:21.620
WELL, THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

39:21.620 --> 39:23.143
I DON'T KNOW.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.450
WELL, IT'S--IT'S
NOT LIKE I THINK I--

39:25.450 --> 39:27.669
THINK YOU OWED IT
TO ME OR ANYTHING.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.279
BUT IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN NICE,

39:29.279 --> 39:31.673
YOU KNOW, TO GET A CALL
FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.545
I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND
HERE, OK?

39:33.545 --> 39:35.416
I'M SORRY?

39:35.416 --> 39:38.898
LOOK, I FEEL REALLY BAD
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER
AND EVERYTHING,

39:38.898 --> 39:43.163
AND I WANT TO HELP
YOU OUT WITH, LIKE,
WHATEVER YOU NEED,

39:43.163 --> 39:45.078
BUT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

39:46.949 --> 39:50.953
LOOK, I GOTTA GET
TO GYM CLASS, OK?

39:50.953 --> 39:51.998
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.134
HERE YOU GO.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.789
I WAS READING
THIS ARTICLE
IN THIS MAGAZINE

40:00.789 --> 40:02.835
ABOUT THIS LAKE
IN WINNIPEG.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.924
IT'S AWESOME CAMPING

40:04.924 --> 40:08.493
AND SOME OF
THE BEST BASS FISHING
IN ALL OF CANADA.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.451
FOR SPRINGTIME, WHEN
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.844
THANKS.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.281
AND YOU GOTTA
CHECK OUT THE PIECE

40:14.281 --> 40:16.979
ON THE NEW
PHEROMONE LURES
IN THAT ONE.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.591
THAT'S IT?
NO RESTAURANT STUFF?

40:19.591 --> 40:22.811
I THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT JUNK.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.509
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.467
HOW'D THE, UH,
BANCROFT THING GO?

40:26.467 --> 40:27.816
GOD.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.644
DON'T ASK.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.254
IT WAS A TOTAL
BLOODBATH.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.518
HEH. COME ON, BAILEY.

40:33.518 --> 40:34.910
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.913
THAT RESTAURANT
NEEDS YOU, CHARLIE.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.872
EVERYONE THERE
IS LIKE...

40:39.872 --> 40:41.917
"HOW CAN WE
RADIATE HIM FASTER?

40:41.917 --> 40:45.530
CAN WE, LIKE,
POP HIM IN THE MICROWAVE
OR SOMETHING?"

40:45.530 --> 40:47.836
BAILEY, UH...

40:47.836 --> 40:50.099
I GOT A CALL
FROM BANCROFT
THIS MORNING.

40:50.099 --> 40:52.232
HE WANTED TO BOOK US
FOR NEXT YEAR.

40:52.232 --> 40:54.103
WELL, OF COURSE HE DID.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.845
THAT'S BECAUSE
I PROMISED THE GUY
UP AND DOWN

40:56.845 --> 40:58.543
THAT YOU'D
BE BACK BY THEN.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.414
BAY, IT'S OK.

41:00.414 --> 41:02.851
I'M GLAD IT'S GOING WELL.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.421
ALL I'M SAYING IS

41:07.421 --> 41:10.424
WE'LL BE A LOT
BETTER OFF WHEN
YOU'RE BACK.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.861
BUT THAT MAY NOT BE
FOR A WHILE.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.691
AND UNTIL I AM,

41:16.691 --> 41:19.694
THAT PLACE IS YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.

41:21.522 --> 41:25.004
AND IF YOU WANT IT,

41:25.004 --> 41:26.875
THAT'S GREAT.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.877
THAT'D BE REALLY GREAT.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.237
Claudia: REED.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.937
REED.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.113
HEY, CAN WE TALK
FOR A SECOND?

41:47.113 --> 41:49.985
REED, CAN--CAN WE
JUST TALK FOR A MINUTE?

42:03.433 --> 42:04.870
REED, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

42:04.870 --> 42:07.046
WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING AWAY FROM ME?

42:07.046 --> 42:08.743
REED, PLEASE DON'T
WALK AWAY FROM ME!

42:08.743 --> 42:10.615
LOOK, I GOTTA
BE SOMEPLACE, OK?

42:10.615 --> 42:13.792
YOU CAN'T
JUST DO ALL THAT,
LIKE, BE MY FRIEND

42:13.792 --> 42:15.663
AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY.
YOU CAN'T!

42:15.663 --> 42:17.099
WOULD YOU JUST STOP,
CLAUDIA, PLEASE?

42:17.099 --> 42:18.710
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

42:18.710 --> 42:21.234
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
WHAT DID I DO?

42:23.105 --> 42:25.151
LOOK, IT--IT'S JUST
TOO INTENSE, OK?

42:25.151 --> 42:27.109
BUT, REED, I NEED YOU.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.850
I'M SORRY.

42:28.850 --> 42:29.721
I CAN'T.

42:39.513 --> 42:40.949
OK, THE PARTY'S
NOT HERE YET,

42:40.949 --> 42:42.560
BUT GET A BRUSCHETTA
READY.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.997
KARL SAYS THEY ALWAYS
ORDER AT LEAST ONE, OK?

42:44.997 --> 42:48.783
UH, TABLE 6 IS READY
TO CLEAR, AND 8 NEEDS
SOME MORE WATER.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.393
HOW IS EVERYTHING
HERE, FOLKS?

42:50.393 --> 42:52.831
