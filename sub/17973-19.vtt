Welcome home, baby.
How as your day?

00:36.504 --> 00:38.937
Fine. Found a
dead rat in the truck.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.973
It smelled pretty bad,
but I kind of didn't mind

00:40.975 --> 00:42.708
because it was
so different from

00:42.710 --> 00:45.477
anything else I'd smelled
in a while. You?

00:45.479 --> 00:49.048
Oh, I've just been doing
a few things around the house.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.817
Spiral sliced ham
and green bottled beer?!

00:51.819 --> 00:53.952
Have you been reading
my wish journal?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.821
(laughs)

00:55.823 --> 00:58.624
You crazy, baby.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.959
I've just noticed how hard
my man's been working,

01:00.961 --> 01:02.861
and thought he deserved
some pampering.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.663
Ho-ho, I ain't
wearing no diaper.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.932
And I was thinking,
you know that man-cation

01:06.934 --> 01:09.001
you've been wanting
to take with the guys?

01:09.003 --> 01:11.170
Why don't you do it
this weekend?

01:11.172 --> 01:14.139
Now, sit still
and let me fix you a plate.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.208
(upbeat music plays)

01:23.116 --> 01:25.117
Ham-ham-ham-ham-ham.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.985
ALL:
She's having an aff.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.821
Ham again?
Don't be naive.

01:28.823 --> 01:30.122
When women do nice
things without asking,

01:30.124 --> 01:31.957
they're cheating on you.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.093
While I agree with you
in theory,

01:34.095 --> 01:36.428
I can't believe my Donna
would cheat on me.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.765
Then again, what kind
of man would I be

01:39.767 --> 01:43.202
if I didn't automatically
think the worst about a woman?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.771
Hmm.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.339
REVEREND JENKINS:
...you been lookin' just like

01:47.341 --> 01:48.974
this here wooden boy,

01:48.976 --> 01:53.278
and after all that Geppetto
had done for him!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.781
Why are you sweating like a
whore in church?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.783
Sh. Don't say
"whore" in church.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.018
(sighs) Is he going
to talk all day?

02:00.020 --> 02:01.487
This is why I'm an atheist.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.288
Here come the lightning.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.025
And now, here's some
goody-goody kid.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.194
Good morning.
My name is Hunter,

02:09.196 --> 02:11.196
and I'm a Churchaholic.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.998
Oh, that is clever.
So clever.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.199
(scoffs)

02:14.201 --> 02:16.969
As a member of the church Youth
Choir and Mission Team,

02:16.971 --> 02:20.372
I can tell you it's not always
easy being a Christian teenager.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.641
Just look at our culture.
Lady Gaga?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.110
Where's Lady GodGod?

02:25.112 --> 02:27.946
Justin Bieber?
How about Jesus Believer?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.982
Facebook?
Uh, no, thank you.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.984
I'll take the Good Book.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.086
Is he (bleep)
kidding with this?

02:34.088 --> 02:35.621
(whispers):
Don't say (bleep) in church.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.923
So the next time you
teens want to go

02:37.925 --> 02:40.125

04:49.490 --> 04:50.956
I'm Vanessa.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.924
You've got a
really nice singing voice.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.993
I also do impressions.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.595
Hello, I'm Tilda Swinton.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.263
(laughs)

04:58.265 --> 04:59.698
You're funny.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.768
Hey, you should join
the Mission Team choir.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.770
We're going to spend a week
singing at churches

05:04.772 --> 05:07.472
and building a house for a poor
family in North Carolina.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.374
That's like so poor.

05:09.376 --> 05:13.278
We could use a big, strapping
guy with a voice like yours.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.115
I'll do it!
Because I love Jesus.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.184
(Mexican accent):
It's-a pronounced <i>hay-sus.</i>

05:22.422 --> 05:25.357
Well, Donna,
I'm off to my man-cation

05:25.359 --> 05:29.361
you encouraged so you could be
unattended for three days

05:29.363 --> 05:32.698
in this home we have built
with our love.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.466
Don't you worry
about me, baby.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.802
I'll find somg

05:36.804 --> 05:39.204

That's my scarf!

06:11.971 --> 06:14.339
A letter.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.187
Well, time to start anew.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.989
Hey, sweet cheeks!

06:30.991 --> 06:32.157
You goin' with someone?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.825
WOMAN:
Yeah. Gary.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.160
A'ight, then.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.095
'Bout your fat friend?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.096
MAN:
I'm Gary!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.998
A'ight, I'll catch ya.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.433
(engine starts)

06:44.370 --> 06:47.973
Well, I'm off to sing
about Jesus and crap.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.041
Kids, you're going
to the movies.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.043
No Travolta.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.451
Ah-ha!
(gasps) Cleveland!

06:59.453 --> 07:01.753
Wh-what are you
doing here?!

07:01.755 --> 07:04.456
Well, I'm not cheating
on my husband in the house

07:04.458 --> 07:08.360
where he pays a third of the
mortgage, that's for sure!

07:08.362 --> 07:10.061
Cleveland, I'm not
having an affair.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.498
Before you ever
came back to town,

07:13.500 --> 07:16.001
I dated a guy
named Maurice.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.869
We went out
a couple times and then

07:17.871 --> 07:19.504
he was shipped
off to Iraq.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.506
The war one?
Yes.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.643
He wrote me letters,
and I wrote him back.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.045
You should have heard some of
the things he told me.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.914
I don't care what
they say on the news,

07:28.916 --> 07:30.615
Iraq sounds
really unpleasant.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.983
I don't watch the news.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.819
I haven't heard from him
in a long time,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.921
but then I got a letter
saying he was coming back

07:35.923 --> 07:37.823
and wanted to see me.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.024
He was fighting for our country.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.626
It was the least I could do.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.629
No, the least you could do is
put a yellow ribbon magnet

07:44.631 --> 07:47.098
on the back of your SUV.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.035
You are my wife whether
you like it or not.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.838
So, when this
Maurice person gets here,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.040
I'm going to
tell him the truth!

07:55.042 --> 07:57.442
(doorbell rings)

07:57.444 --> 08:00.178
Hello. I'm Maurice.
Who are you?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.480
I'm... uh,

08:01.482 --> 08:04.649
I'm... Donna's brother,
Cleveson.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.753
And now I'm gonna have
to remember that.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.522
My name is Cleveson.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.591
Hi.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.801
Donna, your friend is
(clears throat)

08:22.803 --> 08:24.436
shorter than I imagined.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.871
I saw that, Cleveland.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.206
That must be why I haven't
heard from him in so long.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.876
Well, the sooner you get in
there and tell him the truth,

08:30.878 --> 08:32.944
the sooner you
can start dinner.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.080
If it's that easy, then why
didn't you tell him,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.948
Cleveson?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.084
I was caught off guard.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.785
At least I had
the presence of mind

08:40.787 --> 08:42.687
not to tack on
an Irish accent,

08:42.689 --> 08:44.789
which you know I could've.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.658
(with Irish accent):

09:14.755 --> 09:17.255

09:30.337 --> 09:33.104
Uh, no. My parents
home-church me.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.108
Well played. Okay then, I guess
I'll just see you tomorrow.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.510
Oh, uh, one more thing.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.912
I checked the roster of the
Stoolbend High Atheist Club

09:40.914 --> 09:44.115
and found out you're the sole
member and vice president.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.618
Well, that wasn't
very Christian of you.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.920
Vanessa's mine!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.822
So stay away from her.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.923
Understand?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.725
Yeah.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.860
Wait, what is that?

09:55.862 --> 09:58.129
A bobby pin?
What?!

09:58.131 --> 09:58.964
That's weird.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.966
It sure is.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.002
I mean, why would
a 15-year-old boy

10:04.004 --> 10:06.371
have a bobby pin
in his thick, curly,

10:06.373 --> 10:09.040
Mark Feuerstein-like hair?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.543
This bobby pin
wouldn't be for a...

10:11.545 --> 10:13.111
"yar-mul-kay"?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.579
It's yarmulke!
Ah-ha!

10:14.581 --> 10:16.081
Okay, fine!
I'm Jewish, so what?!

10:16.083 --> 10:17.182
So what?!

10:17.184 --> 10:19.017
You're dog
the same thin!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.085
Except your family
would definitely

10:20.087 --> 10:21.753
be more upset about it.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.588
Look, Junior. I've been working
this Christian angle

10:23.590 --> 10:25.657
for a year now just to
get close to Vanessa.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.759
I am not about to let you
step in now

10:27.761 --> 10:29.027
and take her away from me!

10:29.029 --> 10:30.662
Maybe I'll tell her
you've been lying.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.963
Maybe I'll tell her
you've been lying!

10:31.965 --> 10:34.032
(gasp)
You're a monster!

10:34.034 --> 10:36.701
Yeah, I just said
what you said!
Fair enough.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.170
You don't destroy me,
I don't destroy you.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.006
But I will defeat you.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.008
And Vanessa will be mine.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.143
I'm gonna need
that bobby pin back.

Junior?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.451
That's true, too.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.754
So, you were both lying
about being Christians

12:02.756 --> 12:04.089
just to be with me?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.323
Yeah.
Sorry.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.324
Wow.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.093
You guys are bad.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.128
Really bad.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.162
That's...

12:11.164 --> 12:13.298
kind of exciting.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.966

When we get to North Carolina,

12:47.167 --> 12:50.201
I'm going to tear you two up.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.603
Tear us up?!

12:51.605 --> 12:52.971
I just wanted to smooch.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.806
Yeah, and I just wanted
to take you

12:54.808 --> 12:56.141
to the soda fountain
for a phosphate.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.877
Ooh, is that like
a Jewish sex thing?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.745
'Cause I heard you
guys are really kinky.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.280
Not true at all.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.982
Get ready, boys,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.117
because when
I'm done with you,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.453
you will both see

13:08.455 --> 13:10.255
God.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.558
(both scream)

13:16.128 --> 13:18.496
Maurice, let me just say
that I appreciate

13:18.498 --> 13:20.098
your service more than
these other guys

13:20.100 --> 13:22.200
because I'm a Republican.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.103
And while cowardice has
prevented me from serving,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.139
I will shamelessly behave
as if your sacrifice is my own.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.542
At ease, Billy Ray.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.478
Cleveson, I know we've only
known each other for a few days,

13:33.480 --> 13:35.513
but I wanted to ask you,
Cleveson,

13:35.515 --> 13:37.448
would you be my best man?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.350
Wh!
Hells!

13:39.352 --> 13:42.120
I'd be honored.
Who you marrying, BTW?

13:42.122 --> 13:42.987
Your sister.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.155
I don't have a sister.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.590
Donna!

13:45.592 --> 13:46.624
Oh.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.959
Oh!

13:47.961 --> 13:49.961
Oh, Cleveson.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.463
Wow, I am so embarrassed.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.633
I've been calling Cleveson,
"Cleveland" for years.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.702
And I didn't know
he was married to his sister.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.170
I approve.

14:00.706 --> 14:03.474
Oh, good. I'm glad
you're both here.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.810
Donna, I need to
ask you something.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.580
Wait! Donna, there's something
I was going to tell you...

14:08.582 --> 14:11.182
but I don't remember
what it was.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.517
Hmm.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.085
Oh, well,
go ahead, Maurice.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.521
Donna Tubbs,
will you marry me?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.423
(yells)
Holy balls!

14:18.425 --> 14:19.924
Oh, right!

14:19.926 --> 14:24.295
Oh, Maurice, there's something
I should have told you long ago,

14:24.297 --> 14:26.064
but I haven't had the strength.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.001
(long sigh)

14:30.003 --> 14:32.036
I'm already married.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.104
To Cleveland.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.205
Who's Cleveland?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.107
Cleveson is Cleveland.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.775
And he's not my brother.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.143
He's my husband.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.479
Hi, Cleveland Brown.
Nice to finally meet you.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.780
You both lied to me?

14:42.782 --> 14:43.781
Well, hers was worse.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.116
You've only known me
two days.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.085
I'm just saying.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.687
We are both
equally at fault.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.522
I am so sorry.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.992
And you can stay here
as long as you need to.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.360
I don't know
what hurts worse,

14:55.362 --> 14:57.762
when I lost my legs
or when you broke my heart.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.631
Well, obviously when
I lost my legs,

14:59.633 --> 15:00.965
but this hurts, too!

15:00.967 --> 15:03.701
I can't even
look at your faces.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.003
(sobs)

15:06.005 --> 15:09.207
(sobbing)

15:14.480 --> 15:16.781
Oh, whoa!

15:16.783 --> 15:18.850
(sobbing)

15:22.321 --> 15:24.856
He would be awful
at Murderball.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.166
I would like to
go on record as saying

15:35.168 --> 15:39.604
you have made every wrong choice
imaginable in this situation.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.140
Maurice,
I've got great news!

15:42.142 --> 15:43.975
You're gonna want to
sit down for this...

15:43.977 --> 15:47.011
sah, sah, sah, sah...
(clears throat nervously)

15:47.013 --> 15:50.481
We have arranged for a
citywide parade

15:50.483 --> 15:53.017
to honor your
military service!

15:53.019 --> 15:57.155
And, you will be presented with
the Stoolbend Medal of Valor

15:57.157 --> 16:00.825
in a ceremony I will later
post on the YouTubes!

16:00.827 --> 16:02.126
You've earned it, soldier.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.328
So, we cool?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.796
No, we not cool!

16:04.798 --> 16:06.931
You think you can just give
me some consolation medal

16:06.933 --> 16:08.199
and kick met
in the str?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.767
You probably want me
homeless, out there

16:09.769 --> 16:10.969
washing windshields
with a squeegee!

16:10.971 --> 16:13.538
Tell you what, I'll wash
your windows right now.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.605
(spitting)

16:15.941 --> 16:18.109
Aw, he's just
making it dirtier.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.345
Of course we won't
kick you out, Maurice.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.780
You can stay here until
you get back on your feet...

16:22.782 --> 16:25.917
tah, tah, tah...
(clears throat nervously)

16:37.463 --> 16:39.130
Hey, guys.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.965
The three of us can
sneak out tonight

16:40.967 --> 16:43.034
and I'll do you both
in the new house!

16:43.036 --> 16:46.104
You guys are sinners.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.173
And I'm going to suck
the Devil out of you.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.011
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.912
I am so not ready
to have sex.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.081
I don't even know
what I'm doing!

16:57.083 --> 16:59.083
I've never even
had a girlfriend.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.020
My mom says she's the only
woman I'll ever need.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.921
God, e
that's .

17:03.923 --> 17:06.824
Want to flip a coin
to see who goes first?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.026
Sure.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.395
Heads you go, tails I go.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.133
(gulps)
Good luck.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.835
I just hope she doesn't
use foul language.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.538
Or hook my nipples up
to a car battery.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.940
MAN (on TV):
<i>That ol' prospector's</i>
<i>hold up in the mine.</i>

17:22.942 --> 17:25.009
(gunshot)
MAN 2: Careful Sheriff.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.078
You hit that dynamite
and we're all goners!
Hey, old-timer,

17:27.080 --> 17:29.414
throw out your guns
and come out peaceful-like.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.349
(gunshots)
Say something to him.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.618
No, you say something.
You're the man--
you say it.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.953
MAN 3: How about I teach
your grandma to suck eggs!
(clears throat)

17:35.955 --> 17:37.655
Sir, do you mind?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.290
This is y
movie night.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.626
It's his movie night hat.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.961
(crickets chirping)

17:43.963 --> 17:46.798
Oh, please be dead.
Please be dead.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.433
Please be dead.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.001
Vanessa?

17:53.872 --> 17:55.873
(gulps)

17:56.975 --> 18:00.411
Get over here, you bad boy.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.981
(whining)

18:03.983 --> 18:05.483
<i>Um, God?</i>

18:05.485 --> 18:07.151
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>I've said for years</i>

18:07.153 --> 18:08.820
<i>that I don't</i>
<i>believe in you,</i>

18:08.822 --> 18:10.855
<i>but if anyone's used to</i>
<i>dealing with hypocrites</i>

18:10.857 --> 18:12.924
<i>it would be you, right?</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

18:12.926 --> 18:15.326
<i>Anyway, if you do exist,</i>

18:15.328 --> 18:19.163
<i>this would be a</i>
<i>really good time to intervene.</i>

18:19.698 --> 18:21.032
(groans)

18:21.034 --> 18:22.567
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

18:29.775 --> 18:31.275
Fire!

18:31.277 --> 18:32.743
The house is on fire!

18:32.745 --> 18:34.879
You guys got to get out
of here right now!

18:36.482 --> 18:38.616
(both grunting and moaning)

18:38.618 --> 18:41.152
(panting)

18:42.921 --> 18:46.090
(indistinct radio transmission)

18:46.092 --> 18:48.092
Thanks, m.
I owe you .

18:48.094 --> 18:50.128
And gas money.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.929
Guys, can you
believe this?

18:51.931 --> 18:54.465
I guess we'll just have
to try again tomorrow.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.634
Damn, Vanessa,
you're like a goat.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.202
Yeah, I think tomorrow
Junior and I

18:58.204 --> 18:59.971
are going to be busy
rebuilding that house.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.506
Rebuild?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.941
I thought you
guys were cool.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.011
Yeah, well, I know another
carpenter who was pretty cool,

19:07.013 --> 19:09.514
who gave of himself
to those in need.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.116
His name was Ty Pennington.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.986
And he's
a virgin, too.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.525
(fanfare playing)

19:20.527 --> 19:23.127
I never understood parades.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.129
It's just a bunch people
standing around

19:25.131 --> 19:26.430
cheering for traffic.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.432
Should I tweet that?
Why not?

19:28.434 --> 19:31.335
You've only got
four followers.
(clicking)

19:31.337 --> 19:32.970
(phone buzzes)

19:32.972 --> 19:36.207
Ha! Parades are dumb.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.708
(dramatic music plays)

19:37.710 --> 19:41.212
(booming shots)

19:42.748 --> 19:46.117
CROWD (chanting):
USA! USA! USA!

19:46.119 --> 19:49.487
USA! USA!

19:49.489 --> 19:51.956
(crowd cheering)

19:51.958 --> 19:54.659
Maurice, we're just trying
to say we're sorry.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.360
Sorry?
We're long past sorry.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.095
What else do you
want us to do?

19:58.097 --> 19:59.497
I want you to suffer.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.965
You're both awful people.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.835
We only lied to spare your
feelings and we apologized.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.637
So, either forgive us or don't

20:06.639 --> 20:08.172
but stop being a dick!

20:08.174 --> 20:09.941
Well, if that's
how you feel then

20:09.943 --> 20:11.475
why don't you
do something about it?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.244
Stop it!
Make me stop!

20:13.246 --> 20:14.345
Come on!
(grunts)

20:14.347 --> 20:16.447
You just gonna stand there
and let me hit you?

20:16.449 --> 20:17.815
Hit me back!
Come on.
(grunts)

20:17.817 --> 20:19.350
You lying pansy!
Hit me!

20:19.352 --> 20:20.651
(growls)

20:22.921 --> 20:24.488
(Donna shrieks)
(crowd gasps)

20:25.791 --> 20:28.192
Oh, my God, I punched
a wheelchair guy!

20:28.194 --> 20:30.595
(crowd booing)

20:32.531 --> 20:34.332
Everybody shut up!

20:34.334 --> 20:36.467
You know, this is
the first time anyone's

20:36.469 --> 20:38.269
treated me like
a man since my injury.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.937
And that's all
I ever wanted, Donna.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.341
Just to be treated with respect,
like any other man.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.444
I am so sorry
I lied to you, Maurice.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.679
I know.
And I forgive you.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.482
Thanks, Cleveland.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.017
