00:58.308 --> 01:00.810
Look who's doing the walk of shame.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.770
Mmh.

01:01.853 --> 01:05.440
Brassiere is unaccounted for,
stilettos in hand.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.941
You work it, girl.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.943
What the hell are you talking about?

01:09.027 --> 01:11.613
I spent the night with my boyfriend,
took a car back here.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.990
Like I said. Walk of shame.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.158
You do you, boo.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.453
Do we have to do this right now?
I got to get to the office, boo.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.539
But you promised me a meeting
for my Vybrant ideas.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.917
Well, I am officially
breaking my promise.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.003
Oh, no fair.
I finished your new to-do list.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.756
I to-do-ed it all,
including getting staples.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.550
"Staples" is the brand name of the pad
I wrote the list on.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.929
-Good, because I forgot to get staples.
-[sighs]

01:37.931 --> 01:41.434
Ever wonder why the donut
has its own national day?

01:41.518 --> 01:44.354
Ever wonder why
spicy mustard has a week?

01:44.437 --> 01:45.772
Not for one second.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.941
Well, wonder no more!

01:49.442 --> 01:51.528
"National Vibrator Day"?

01:51.611 --> 01:55.240
It's like National Donut Day
but for vibrators!

01:55.740 --> 02:00.078
Grace, not only will this
get us tons of great publicity,

02:00.161 --> 02:05.333
it will also reach vaginas
of all socioeconomic classes!

02:05.416 --> 02:06.459
[claps]

02:06.543 --> 02:11.840
I like the enthusiasm,
but vibrators aren't like donuts.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.800
People don't bring a dozen into work.

02:13.883 --> 02:18.304
Because masturbation in the office
isn't socially acceptable...

02:18.388 --> 02:19.222
yet.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.018
Okay, so... great meeting.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.230
That wasn't a meeting.
That wasn't even five minutes.

02:27.313 --> 02:31.359
Frankie, this is a lot of energy
coming at me and I barely slept at Nick's.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.861
"I barely slept at Nick's."

02:33.736 --> 02:37.365
Bragging about your love-making
is not going to stop me.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.533
What will?

02:38.616 --> 02:40.577
Nothing. I'm unstoppable.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.956
Your robe is caught on the cabinet.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.834
Why does this keep happening?

02:48.459 --> 02:49.669
Bye!

02:55.300 --> 02:58.178
Can you believe my monstrous housemate?

02:58.261 --> 03:00.054
I mean, it's our company.

03:00.138 --> 03:04.434
Sol, how do you go about getting
a national day for vibrators?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.854
In Masturbation Month,
which is May, of course.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.939
You'd think it would be a winter month.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.736
But day-making isn't really
my area of expertise.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.906
At least now that we've talked shop,
I can write this brunch off.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.950
You can't write off
a free brunch made by Coyote.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.702
[chuckles] Free?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.245
[both laugh]

03:24.329 --> 03:27.123
At least he cooks us a meal
when he asks for money.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.083
How much is this going to cost?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.960
I mean, what's on the menu?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.712
Brunch is served.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.964
Frittata Coyota.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.301
Italian eggs.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.344
This is gonna hurt.

03:42.180 --> 03:46.017
Oh, honey, you didn't have
to go to all this trouble.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.602
Anything for you two.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.562
Just tell us what you need.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.775
What I need is for you guys
to look under your seats.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.656
Umm.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.742
Oh, sorry, under your plates.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.124
What is this?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.251
I don't get it.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.378
It looks like a check, but it's...

04:13.920 --> 04:15.213
but it's made out to me.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.048
I wanna start paying you guys back

04:17.131 --> 04:19.342
for all the money
you've loaned me over the years.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.386
How can you afford this?

04:21.469 --> 04:24.055
-I'm a teacher.
-Right, how can you afford this?

04:24.138 --> 04:26.182
I'm also an extreme couponer.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.851
Guess how much I paid
for these slightly expired eggs?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.729
-You don't have to pay us back.
-I do.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.564
And I've wanted to for a long time.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.566
That's very sweet.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.735
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.572
-Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.
-[Coyote] Hmm.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.865
[Frankie] Oh.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.492
[both chuckle]

04:45.285 --> 04:48.746
Do you have any idea how to get
a national day for a vibrator?

04:48.830 --> 04:49.914
Oh.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.750
I don't,
but it should definitely be in May.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.669
That's what I thought.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.090
So, Brianna was thinking
we should send gifts to all the execs--

04:59.173 --> 05:00.133
Did it.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.469
Nice bottle of scotch
and tickets to Celine Dion.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.930
-She also wants you--
-Payroll, did it.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.516
Yep. Okay.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.727
Now, we need to chart out
the best locations

05:10.810 --> 05:12.478
-for our products--
-Did it. Sorted by state,

05:12.562 --> 05:15.732
cities, and areas
with the least number of Denny's.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.026
[softly]
Wow.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
You did all that already this morning?

05:20.069 --> 05:20.945
Bingo.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.239
[sighs]
Where do you get the energy?

05:23.323 --> 05:26.159
Life energizes me. The work energizes me.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.244
My boyfriend energizes me.
[chuckles]

05:28.328 --> 05:31.914
-How much coffee you have this morning?
-Zip. Zero.<i> </i>Nada.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.917
-What is going on with you, Mom?
-Zip. Zero.<i> </i>Nada.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.211
This is what focus looks like.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.506
-Grace, I have big news.
-Did it.

05:43.926 --> 05:47.305
Your midterm reviews were stellar.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.765
We have midterm reviews?

05:48.848 --> 05:49.849
-No.
-Yes.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.310
And sorry, Mal, yours are not so great.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.437
But Grace's are excellent,

05:54.520 --> 06:00.693
which is why I am giving you
a promotion to co-CEO!

06:02.070 --> 06:03.780
What the hell are you blabbing about?

06:03.863 --> 06:08.284
See, and there is that co-CEO fire
that served you so well in those reviews.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.410
I have fire.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.953
-Spill it.
-Fine.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.749
<i>Fast Company</i> is doing a story
on "Female CEOs Over 70".

06:14.832 --> 06:16.667
And I think...

06:17.460 --> 06:18.878
with this,

06:19.462 --> 06:20.713
we could get the cover.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.674
So, first you mock me for my age
and now you need me for it?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.134
See, I don't see age.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.844
-Honestly, it's sad you do.
-[scoffs]

06:26.928 --> 06:29.138
So, we're going to lie and say I'm CEO?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.599
Yes. And you are going
to be lying later today,

06:31.682 --> 06:34.268
-so we have a lot of prep work to do.
-This is happening today?

06:34.352 --> 06:37.313
It's called<i> Fast Company</i> for a reason.
They move fast.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.524
Also someone else fell through
so we have a shot.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.650
Okay, I'm in.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.611
But on Monday I want my name
on the office door.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.781
Your name is in gigantic letters
right there.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.032
Not my last name.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.325
Can I get a desk?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.203
You have a desk. You're at it.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.830
Another one? No.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.165
[camera shutter clicks]

06:57.500 --> 06:59.877
Oh, that's so cute, Sol!

06:59.961 --> 07:02.922
Here, let's take a picture
of the two checks together.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.342
I'm not just taking a picture,
I'm actually depositing the check.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.512
-What?
-Through an app on the phone.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.805
It's called mobile banking.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.850
Are you crazy?
You're depositing his check?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
Well... wait--

07:16.644 --> 07:18.438
-Can you do that on your phone?
-Yes.

07:18.521 --> 07:22.733
-What were you gonna do with your check?
-Decoupage it like a normal person!

07:22.817 --> 07:24.986
Children shouldn't have to pay
their parents back.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.947
He's not a child.
He's a man who wants to act like a man.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.991
And I, for one,
am going to encourage that.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.409
By bleeding him dry?

07:31.492 --> 07:33.786
It's called holding him accountable,
Frankie.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.913
It's called being a hard-ass, Sol.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.582
-I'm okay with that.
-I'm not.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.544
Let's get him back here right now.
We need to do a feeling circle about this.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.506
No! No, no, no more feeling circles.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.550
Maybe, when the children were younger,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.844
we should have had
a few less feeling circles

07:49.927 --> 07:51.721
and a few more hard truth circles.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.055
[door closes]

07:53.139 --> 07:55.099
Sorry. Did I come at a bad time?

07:55.183 --> 07:58.060
Yes, if you had come earlier
you would have seen Sol.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.062
I don't recognize this guy.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.939
Oh, I've met this guy.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.858
Another box from Wayfair?

08:03.941 --> 08:06.903
How many dog beds can one dog use?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.321
Shh.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.614
[whispers] It's a surprise.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.199
[Sol] And don't sit down.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.161
Bud and I are going wedding suit shopping.

08:15.244 --> 08:19.290
But Carl needs a nice long walk
and so does your heart.

08:19.707 --> 08:24.879
And Frankie, you can do whatever you want
with our son's gift and so can I.

08:24.962 --> 08:29.383
Have fun spending your son's money
on your other son's suit!

08:29.467 --> 08:31.511
That check won't clear until tomorrow!

08:31.594 --> 08:33.179
-Fine, but--
-[door closes]

08:33.262 --> 08:34.222
What the hell?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.766
I wasn't done yelling at him yet.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.434
Try being married to him.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.895
Oh, right. Can you imagine?

08:41.896 --> 08:42.897
Oh, right.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.565
You just met the new Sol.

08:44.649 --> 08:48.152
The Sol I went to Best Buy with
to buy a new TV.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.822
Well, as I was handing over my Amex card,

08:51.906 --> 08:55.243
he told the sales guy
that we were not ready for an upgrade yet.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.161
Well, I was ready for an upgrade.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.372
The same thing
happened to me with Grace.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.415
But not with a TV, with a chainsaw.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.460
Hey, would you like to have a drink?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.046
-I'll take anything with an umbrella.
-Follow me.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.716
Make it three umbrellas. I'll Uber home.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.218
Oh, God.

09:12.593 --> 09:16.097
"Before you drink, remember
it makes your sleep apnea worse."

09:16.180 --> 09:17.848
Honest to God.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.393
He's like a drill sergeant on my health.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.563
The other night I had a great time
in this wonderful old gay bar.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.523
All I wanted to do is tell him about it.

09:25.606 --> 09:29.151
All he wanted to do was scold me
for having a scotch and a cheeseburger.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.736
What kind of cheese?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.365
Oh, right, right.
Not the point, but I feel you.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.244
I was really excited
to tell Grace my Vybrant idea,

09:38.327 --> 09:42.373
and all she could focus on
was how vibrators aren't like donuts.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.667
Ooh. What kind of donuts?

09:45.876 --> 09:47.211
Oh, right. Not the point.

09:48.129 --> 09:52.300
Has Sol ever told you
that you can't have this?

09:52.383 --> 09:55.303
Candy? Oh, yeah, not allowed.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.931
Oh, my friend,
this is so much more than candy.

10:03.102 --> 10:07.356
So, the article is about older women
who are still dynamic in the workplace.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.527
So, find a way to mention Snapchat
and where you were during Pearl Harbor.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.613
It's a delicate dance.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.908
Grace!

10:18.451 --> 10:19.285
What?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.911
Mom, you fell asleep.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.039
Because you're boring.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.541
I know how to do an interview.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.629
Good, because<i> Fast Company</i>
is going to be here in half an hour

10:29.712 --> 10:32.006
and it needs to be shock and awe,
so pull it together.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.306
[sighs]

10:40.514 --> 10:41.349
[gasps]

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
You need some help?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.446
-I'm fine.
-Mom, I can open it.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.075
-Oh, it's just-- The arthritis is--
-It's okay.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.368
No one can open child-proof caps.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.827
-Wh--
-Except my children. Give it.

11:01.911 --> 11:02.912
[Grace gasps]

11:04.538 --> 11:07.083
-Seriously?
-It's nothing.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.878
It's totally something.
Why are you taking those?

11:10.961 --> 11:14.131
Just two in the morning for a little kick.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.467
You were prescribed two a day?

11:16.550 --> 11:19.470
I don't know the exact dose.
They're Arlene's.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.597
You stole them from Arlene?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.015
She doesn't like them.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.812
Mom, if you took two this morning,
why are you taking more now?

11:27.895 --> 11:31.023
I need a little pick-me-up
if I'm gonna nail this interview.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.068
Like you have a cup of coffee
in the afternoon,

11:34.151 --> 11:35.861
and then you have five more cups.

11:36.278 --> 11:39.949
Except when I order a chai latte,
I don't need a note from my doctor.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.368
Well, if you start to crash, try one.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.453
After about 20 minutes,
you're really poppin'.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.789
I've tried them. I have a kid with ADD.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.708
Right, the boy. I know him.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.253
-Then you know he isn't 80 years old.
-Which is why I need it.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.089
I mean, who can deal
with all this shit at 80?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.967
I am a man.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.011
If I sit on a chair...

12:01.971 --> 12:04.473
I become a chairman.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.642
But of what?

12:06.726 --> 12:10.730
[chuckles] I want to say balloons,
but I know that's not right.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.606
-I love balloons.
-Oh.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.651
-I love red balloons, blue balloons.
-[softly] I...

12:15.735 --> 12:17.069
I'm good on pot.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.113
Oh, you are! Who knew?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.114
[sniffs]

12:20.197 --> 12:21.699
I want to smell balloons.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.618
[both laughing]

12:25.745 --> 12:27.163
I'm so tired.

12:27.246 --> 12:31.000
-Why did I ever wait this long to try it?
-You waited for me.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.003
-This is our time, Robert.
-We are.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.046
[laughs]

12:36.130 --> 12:39.383
Did I tell you that I love your idea?

12:42.344 --> 12:43.387
Which one?

12:44.472 --> 12:48.017
I love your idea
of donut day for vibrators.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.018
Yes.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
Oh, but I can't do it.

12:51.687 --> 12:55.024
-Grace just stands in my way.
-Oh, forget about Grace.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.901
May I ask you,

12:56.984 --> 13:00.821
did Alexander Graham... Cracker

13:00.905 --> 13:04.408
need anyone's permission
to invent the cotton gin?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.579
[chuckles]
He didn't invent the cotton gin.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.874
-Oh.
-But I don't know how to make a day.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.961
Just do an Internet.

13:17.004 --> 13:20.049
Oh, my God.
Have you always been this wise?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.926
-Oh.
-I think I have.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.179
"Tomorrow is National Vibrator Day.

13:25.805 --> 13:31.936
Free vibrators and donuts
to anyone who retweets this!"

13:32.019 --> 13:33.646
-That's the stuff!
-[sighs]

13:33.729 --> 13:36.649
Oh, wait, I just posted that
on Bud's Facebook wall.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.359
Now, I'll tweet it.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.402
Let me help you.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.321
-No.
-[both laugh]

13:44.156 --> 13:48.619
1998, I started this company
in a shoe box on Juniper Street.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.829
We had nothing.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.956
Bootstraps. Concrete walls.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.041
One year later. Boom.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.585
Our face cream had
a two percent market-share. Boom.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.088
Eleven straight quarters of growth.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.130
Boom.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.091
-Impressive.
-Boom.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.717
What made you so successful?

14:03.801 --> 14:06.470
Energy, tenacity, zest, vigor.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.515
-Did I say zest? It's worth saying twice.
-[laughs]

14:09.598 --> 14:13.435
-Wow, you really go a mile a minute.
-I go five miles and I never get tired.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.896
[sighs] Let's have a staring contest.
Don't blink.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.189
Uh... okay.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.404
You're blinking.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.739
A lot.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.076
What the hell?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.580
Oh, I forgot to tell you a little thing.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.707
-Mom's on drugs.
-Well, yeah.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.750
-New drugs.
-[laughs] I won!

14:37.585 --> 14:38.419
[laughs]

14:39.253 --> 14:40.629
-[Grace laughs]
-Hmm.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.050
[Robert] I take the sandwich,

14:45.134 --> 14:49.680
and then I take the tuna
from the other half of the sandwich,

14:50.180 --> 14:54.310
and I take out the two pieces of bread
and throw them away.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.479
That's just a handful of tuna.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.856
Exactly.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.902
What were we talking about?

15:02.985 --> 15:03.944
The leather bar.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.987
No, no, no.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.448
It was leather night in a regular bar.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.158
I can't see you in leather.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.035
[chuckles] I wasn't wearing leather.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.162
Wait. Wait.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.625
Now... you are.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.792
Whoa, Daddy.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.377
Wow.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.172
I feel like the wild one.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.342
I think the look needs a hat.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.803
In fact, we both should be wearing hats.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.013
[whispers]
Yes.

15:31.722 --> 15:36.936
[both] Yes. Yes. Yes.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.520
-[Frankie laughs]
-Yes.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.438
[both laugh]

15:39.521 --> 15:40.731
What do you mean she took a bunch?

15:40.814 --> 15:42.858
Don't know. She took two this morning,
one in front of me,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.568
and she might've taken
another after I left.

15:44.652 --> 15:48.113
You let her take that? What?
Did you open the bottle for her, too?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.659
Uh... Mmh.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.911
Try to knock me down.

15:53.994 --> 15:57.122
-Excuse me?
-Come on. Try to knock me down.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.376
She means,
try to knock her down in this business.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.796
-'Cause no one can, right, Grace?
-I'm sure Elena has to go now.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.465
You've given her so much already.
So, so, so much.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.467
But I have more to say.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.178
Sometimes, in an interview,
it's about what you don't say.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.639
Yeah. So, let's do some don't saying.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.683
We haven't even gotten
to the juicy stuff yet.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.602
-There's juicy stuff?
-Oh, you have no idea.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.605
-Mom. Mommy. Grace.
-I had to come back to save the company

16:21.689 --> 16:23.190
-at 80-years-old.
-Mommy.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.235
-Oh, fun.
-Brianna was running the company.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.278
-I was.
-Into the ground.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.990
We have some financial issues,
but are dealing with them.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.074
This one works for free.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.577
Don't get me wrong,
she doesn't have any experience.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.663
I paid for her degree. She didn't use it.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.751
Anyway, I brokered a deal with Starling
Hotels to save us from Chapter 11.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.169
I did set up that deal.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
You were willing to give up our name.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.716
[chuckles] What's a company
without its name? Nothing!

16:48.799 --> 16:50.884
And she's the smart one.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.013
-[Grace] You got that?
-[interviewer] I did. Yeah.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.597
[doorbell rings]

16:59.351 --> 17:01.311
China Bucket's in the house!

17:02.438 --> 17:04.064
Whoa! That's a lot.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.650
Don't worry, we'll get it down.
Come on in.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.318
Let me give you a tip.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.987
[Frankie] No, no, no, Robert!

17:10.738 --> 17:12.239
This is the new way.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.535
-[phone camera clicks]
-[snickers]

17:16.618 --> 17:19.121
-Now we email him the money shot.
-[laughs]

17:19.204 --> 17:22.207
How about we do it the old way,
just one last time.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.792
Oh.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.837
My husband would kill me if he knew
I was eating all this fried food.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.673
Then he'll kill you
if you eat the Sesame Chicken.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.926
It's technically fried and candied.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.970
Are you lying to me right now?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.264
I never lie about Chinese food.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.767
So it's like a fried candy bar?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.226
But it's chicken.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.481
Shut up.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.149
[chuckles]

17:47.232 --> 17:48.901
[breathing shakily]

17:49.568 --> 17:52.905
Oh, hey!
Where the hell have you two been?

17:52.988 --> 17:55.365
I did it. I got us the cover.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.159
Congratulations.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.662
I'm so happy for you and your company
that you saved single-handedly.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.625
What's with the attitude?
I did exactly what you asked me to.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.793
Huh!

18:05.876 --> 18:08.712
I don't remember asking you
to call me incompetent

18:08.796 --> 18:11.048
and to take all the credit for everything.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.717
Mal, do you remember me doing that?

18:13.801 --> 18:17.554
I wouldn't know.
I'm too dumb to understand anything.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.229
[laughing]

18:27.272 --> 18:28.148
What?

18:28.232 --> 18:31.693
This tableau right here
is Sol's worst nightmare. [laughs]

18:31.777 --> 18:33.570
-Oh, Sol, Shmol.
-[Robert sniffs]

18:33.654 --> 18:35.197
-Let me ask you something.
-Hmm.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.243
If one of your girls wrote you a check
to pay back all the money they owed you,

18:39.326 --> 18:41.078
-would you cash it?
-Sure.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.499
I'd use the money to buy ice skates,
because hell would've frozen over.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.458
[laughs]

18:46.542 --> 18:49.670
-That wasn't even that funny.
-[Robert laughs]

18:49.753 --> 18:51.630
But I'm going to laugh anyway.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.842
-[Robert sniffs, laughs]
-Wait, no, here it comes.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.970
-No, nothing.
-Oh.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.888
[bell chimes]

18:59.972 --> 19:01.890
-What was that?
-Your doorbell.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.059
-Come in!
-[bell chimes]

19:04.143 --> 19:05.310
Oh, that's me.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.315
Hey, 22 retweets!

19:10.774 --> 19:13.861
I actually started a Vibrator Day.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.113
Will children get the day off from school?

19:16.196 --> 19:18.991
[laughs]

19:19.074 --> 19:20.659
No, I'm serious.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.829
No, the hell-frozen-over joke just hit me.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.667
I think all this food
made my high go away.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.005
-Hey, you want to watch<i> Get Smart?</i>
-You're still high.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.842
Oh, careful.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.305
God forbid Carl should eat
any food not prepared by Sol.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.058
Where is Carl?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.396
[Frankie chuckles softly]

19:49.479 --> 19:50.397
Carl!

19:53.859 --> 19:54.943
Carl!

19:55.694 --> 19:57.487
-Carl!
-Here, boy.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.072
Carl!

19:59.156 --> 20:00.324
Carl!

20:00.908 --> 20:03.702
-Does he have a last name?
-I never asked!

20:04.161 --> 20:06.330
Oh, my God, he's not here.
Frankie, he's not here!

20:06.413 --> 20:10.751
Don't worry, if he got out, somebody will
look at the tags on his collar and call.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.631
Carl!

20:15.714 --> 20:17.674
Carl Bergstein!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.384
Carl Bergstein!

20:21.345 --> 20:22.596
[sighs]

20:23.639 --> 20:28.518
Okay, I get it.
I-- I was a little over the top.

20:29.853 --> 20:30.687
[clicks tongue]

20:31.897 --> 20:34.024
You're not actually packing up your desk?

20:34.107 --> 20:35.400
Sure I am.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.737
You saved the company
and I almost destroyed it.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.906
-So, why would I stay?
-Oh, come on.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.576
I told a good story
and now we have the cover.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.411
A good story for who?

20:48.664 --> 20:51.208
All right,
I'm sorry if I stepped on your toes.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.877
You took a pipe to our knees.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.004
-[Grace sighs]
-And that's not even the worst part.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.341
Okay, I also took too many
of those stupid pills.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.717
She's not talking about the pills.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.511
She's talking about why you
came back here.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.846
I came back here
because you needed my help.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.224
That's how you're going to justify this?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.684
-Yeah.
-[Brianna] Really?

21:08.767 --> 21:11.186
So, that first day, when you had
that meeting behind my back,

21:11.270 --> 21:14.856
was that really to get an early start
or was that just to humiliate me?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.568
I was trying to teach you that you have
to work a little harder to be a success.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.821
You weren't trying to teach me
how to be better.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.824
You were trying to teach me you were
better, and you did an excellent job.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.367
You saved your legacy.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.997
It's not that you said
all those terrible things.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.291
It's that you actually believe them.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.296
Wow.

21:37.379 --> 21:41.008
[softly] Yeah... wow for us, too.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.011
[exhales] You're right. I--

21:45.429 --> 21:46.680
[sighs]

21:47.639 --> 21:51.226
I guess I was trying to prove
that even though I'm 80,

21:51.310 --> 21:52.519
I'm better than everyone.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.649
And I guess that included both of you,
and I'm so sorry.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.568
I never should've done that.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.905
-What's happening?
-Don't know.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.199
She said she was sorry,
then I blacked out.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.826
What are you doing?

22:07.909 --> 22:10.787
I am going home
and I don't think I should come back.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.205
Is this a trick?

22:12.622 --> 22:13.623
[chuckles]

22:14.291 --> 22:17.669
No. I mean, look, I'll always be there
if you need me, but...

22:19.129 --> 22:22.215
this is your company
and I'm done telling you what to do.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.842
Okay, now I know this is a trick.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.136
What about your legacy?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.348
I'm looking at it.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.852
Can I give you one last bit of advice?

22:33.935 --> 22:37.522
Start paying your sister
because she works really hard. [inhales]

22:37.898 --> 22:38.774
[exhales]

22:41.568 --> 22:44.488
Mom. Aren't you forgetting something?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.532
Oh, yeah, you want my restroom key.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.867
Mom!

22:48.950 --> 22:50.452

22:52.454 --> 22:54.289

Oh. Carl?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.138
Carl?

23:11.848 --> 23:12.849
Carl.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.435
-Carl.
-[door closes]

23:16.019 --> 23:17.104
Carl?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.105
[sighs]

23:18.563 --> 23:19.981
What are you still doing here?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.608
Uh... We--

23:21.691 --> 23:24.027
[stutters] We didn't finish our fight!

23:24.111 --> 23:27.072
Well, what else
did you want to say about it?

23:27.155 --> 23:29.116
I don't know. I have to look at my notes.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.952
You won't believe
the retorts I've compiled.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.203
Wait a minute. Where's Carl?

23:34.371 --> 23:36.289
Carl wanted to go out.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.835
It seems he wanted some alone time,
but he didn't tell Robert.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.838
He keeps a lot of secrets.
I mean, what is his last name?

23:42.921 --> 23:45.424
Oh, my God. You lost my dog?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.217
He couldn't have gone far.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.219
How could you two let this happen?

23:49.302 --> 23:52.681
And where did all
this Chinese food come from?

23:52.764 --> 23:54.474
These are all good questions.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.644
If I had my list of retorts,
I could start answering them.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.104
-Are you high?
-Yes,

23:59.187 --> 24:01.106
but only 'cause Robert couldn't drink.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.274
Robert's high?

24:02.357 --> 24:04.484
Why do you think
there's so much Chinese food?

24:04.568 --> 24:05.986
Robert ate Chinese food?!

24:06.069 --> 24:08.488
Carl did not.
Robert was adamant about that.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.157
So let me get this straight.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.950
You got my husband high,

24:12.033 --> 24:15.120
you fed him a bunch of fried food,
and then you lost my dog?

24:15.203 --> 24:17.330
I don't know if it was in that order.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.584
I cannot believe
how irresponsible you are.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.546
I never thought I'd see the day
where Coyote is the mature one.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.590
Hey, don't you start ragging on my son.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.133
I'm ragging on you.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.011
And wait until I get a hold of Robert.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.304
Now, excuse me,

24:32.387 --> 24:34.931
-I'm going to look for my dog!

-Hey-hoo. [chuckles]

24:38.935 --> 24:40.020
Did you get a nice suit?

24:40.353 --> 24:41.730
-[Robert chuckles]
-Oh.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.274
-Thank God.
-[Robert chuckles]

24:53.867 --> 24:55.577
Does he seem angry

24:55.660 --> 25:00.457
or am I in that phase of being high
where you're really paranoid?

25:00.540 --> 25:02.459
No. He's super pissed.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.253

25:09.716 --> 25:12.344
[door opens and closes]

25:12.427 --> 25:18.058
Frankie, why do we have thousands
of requests for free vibrators and donuts?

25:18.141 --> 25:21.603
What do you mean? There were just
22 retweets an hour ago.

25:21.686 --> 25:26.858
Oh, yeah, well, Kareena G retweeted it
to her 11.5 million followers.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.194
And 50,000 of them retweeted it!

25:29.277 --> 25:31.655
Oh, wow! That's just great!

25:33.198 --> 25:35.659
How are we going to get the money
to pay for all this?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.037
Did you know...

25:41.164 --> 25:44.084
you can just send this right to the bank?
