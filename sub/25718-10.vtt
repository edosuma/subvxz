00:55.096 --> 00:56.181
Is your stomach okay?

00:58.266 --> 01:01.394
Yes, I think I feel better now.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.233
Don't worry.
You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.986
What are you talking about?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.322
-I heard you carried me home.
-What about it?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.949
I'm sorry for the trouble.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.913
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.790
What?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.419
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.721
<i>What does he mean? I shouldn't let</i>
<i>any other guy carry me home?</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:46.648
Aren't you coming?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.026
Oh, yes. I'm coming.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.548
Hello.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.342
-How have you been?
-Good.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.802
Who is he?

02:15.885 --> 02:18.263
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

02:18.346 --> 02:20.181
I thought Mi-rae was famous
and followed her.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.641
You even remember my name?

02:21.724 --> 02:23.143
Because you're so pretty.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.478
You probably don't remember my name.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.231
-Your name?
-I'm Kim Se-hoon.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.941
Right, Se-hoon.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.237
Are you on Instagram?
Let's follow each other.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.156
I don't do those things.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.409
Remember my name, too.

02:40.952 --> 02:41.786
I'm Do Kyung-seok.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.539
Are you her boyfriend?

02:44.622 --> 02:45.707
-Yes.
-No.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.627
You're her boyfriend?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.545
-No.
-Yes.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.762
This is my stop. Have a good day.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.641
Bye.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.646
Why did you lie to him?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.231
When did I lie?

03:10.607 --> 03:13.067
I am a boy friend, not a girl friend.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.865
It's a good tactic to ward off those
who bug you.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.746
<i>Why is he being like this?</i>
<i>He's leading me on.</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:54.025
Her.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.860
Do you like him?

03:58.154 --> 03:58.988
Do you?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.618
<i>Don't let any other guy carry you home.</i>

04:15.338 --> 04:16.339
<i>Hey.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:19.926
<i>Do you have feelings for me?</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:39.320
Stay focused.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.031
Okay.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.242
This is the last experiment
of the semester.

04:44.325 --> 04:48.204
Stay focused until the end
and submit your report today.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.789
-Got it.
-Okay.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.007
What's wrong?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.759
-I don't have last week's report.
-What?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.346
I'm sure you have it with you.
Try looking again.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.723
It's not here.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.558
What should I do?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.019
What's wrong with you today?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.521
All our grades depend on that report.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.690
And you're saying you lost it?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.608
What are we going to do?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.612
Should we make it up?

05:23.281 --> 05:24.198
I'm sorry.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.951
My gosh.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.122
Let's look for it again.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.742
A) THE RECRYSTALLIZATION OF ACETANILIDE
1) THE HEATING TIME

06:08.785 --> 06:10.870
Yes, it was 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.002
Yes, it was two grams. I remember now.

06:18.711 --> 06:19.879
My goodness.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.133
He's not only good looking,
but he's a genius as well.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.850
This is all we need?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.310
Yes, sir.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.145
Thanks.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.233
Sua, you should treat him to a meal.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.359
Of course.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.955
-I'll go now.
-I'll go with you.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.252
Bye, Kyung-seok.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.633
I was really startled
because of the report.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.677
I'll treat you to a meal later.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.679
No, it's okay.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.100
I'll just get you something
at the school cafeteria.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.769
At least let me buy you that.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.148
We really picked a great team leader.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.066
Well, that's not really true.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.152
He volunteered
because no one wanted to.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.195
Imagine if you were the leader.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.365
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>
<i>Am I jealous right now?</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:30.658
So relieved.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.290
I was really upset
after you left yesterday.

07:37.832 --> 07:42.587
I wanted to help you out because I figured
we have something in common.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.756
Plus, we both are living by ourselves now.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.469
I thought both your parents passed away.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.762
Why bother moving out?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.184
My grandma nags a lot.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.394
Do you feel better?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.147
I know a restaurant
that sells great hangover noodles.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.482
Just a second.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.734
We came to hand in our report.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.236
-Leave it on my desk.
-Okay.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.364
Sorry. They also sell
a lot of other delicious menus as well.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.200
It's on me. Let's go eat there.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.460
Next.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.463
It's really delicious.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.132
I'm glad you like it. Eat up.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.218
Thank you.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.972
How's it going with your candles?

08:36.557 --> 08:38.683
I was planning
on selling fragrant candles,

08:39.227 --> 08:43.022
but it's not as easy as I thought,
so I'm going to get another part-time job.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.362
Cheer up.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.366
Thank you.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.370
You should've added your photo.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.706
They consider applicants' looks a lot.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.792
You saw it at the interview.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.835
Looks don't get the work done.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.840
You guys look great together.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.302
The sight of you two together is
too much...

09:13.386 --> 09:15.513
-Be careful.
-Block your own eyes.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.889
Stop joking around.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.517
-Are you guys finally going out?
-No.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.605
Eat up.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.858
Gosh, I'm so jealous. Enjoy your meal.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.991
-You must be bothered by those comments.
-I don't care.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.659
Really?

09:37.910 --> 09:40.079
I'd love to be so strong-minded like you.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.791
Then I wouldn't care about
what others say.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.260
By the way, are you not interested
in dating anyone?

10:02.727 --> 10:05.229
Do you not want a boyfriend?

10:07.398 --> 10:10.526
I'm not really interested.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.236
Why not? You're probably popular.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.489
I'm not popular. There are so many
pretty girls out there.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.535
You're the prettiest in our department.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.540
Stop joking around.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.834
I'm being serious.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.634
Did I just make you feel uncomfortable?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.012
No, that's not it.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.724
But I'm sure you already know.

10:46.103 --> 10:49.398
I did a lot of plastic surgery.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.444
What's wrong with that?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.866
You did it to become pretty
and now you're pretty.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.120
What's weird about that?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.669
Let's eat.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.297
How weird.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.215
What's weird?

11:15.466 --> 11:19.679
You don't seem weak-minded, seeing
that you moved out to live on your own.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.350
Although I don't know why you had to.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.814
There's no special reason.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.660
That's Mi-rae and Woo-young.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.749
Thank you.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.085
You shouldn't have.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.629
Stop thanking me.
I only bought some noodles.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.588
But still...

11:55.673 --> 11:57.091
I want to treat you again.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.008
Pardon?

11:58.676 --> 11:59.927
I need to get to class.

12:00.010 --> 12:00.928
Okay.

12:01.011 --> 12:01.929
-See you.
-Yes.

12:11.939 --> 12:12.857
Hello?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.900
<i>You applied for a part-time job, right?</i>

12:15.401 --> 12:16.360
Yes.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.238
Yes, I can make it to the interview.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.118
Okay, thank you.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.620
Mi-rae.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.378
Did you eat?

12:35.004 --> 12:35.880
Yes.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.298
With whom?

12:37.757 --> 12:38.758
Woo-young.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.052
You guys must be really close.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.139
Yes, we live in the same neighborhood.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.058
Let's go home together.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.690
Kyung-seok and Woo-young live together.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.779
I need to go somewhere.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.905
Where?

13:00.988 --> 13:03.657
-An interview for a part-time job.
-A part-time job?

13:04.408 --> 13:06.952
-Do they need more workers?
-I'm not sure.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.079
Can you ask them for me?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.916
You can ask yourself.
I'll give you the number.

13:11.999 --> 13:16.337
I've never done anything like that before.
Do me a favor. After all, we're friends.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.093
I'll be off now.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.762
See you guys later.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.932
Kyung-seok, I wish you
good luck this time.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.734
-You think neighbors should be close?
-What?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.612
You said you're close with Woo-young
because you're neighbors.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.492
I just said that because Sua asked me
a question.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.036
Does that mean we're close too?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.454
It's not the same with you.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.206
What?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.123
I mean...

13:53.207 --> 13:57.670
We were already friends
before you moved into my neighborhood.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.215
Then can I go with you?

14:01.298 --> 14:03.133
-Seriously?
-Yes.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.274
Why?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.527
It's so weird.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.321
Why?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.254
Sua.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.257
It's just a snap, but it looks amazing.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.925
Look.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.764
You seemed really startled earlier
because of the report.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.393
I would've been in big trouble
if it weren't for Kyung-seok.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.479
You must've been worried about your grade.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.690
Don't say that.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.861
But I wish you wouldn't take pictures
without asking me like this.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.406
Isn't it a crime to take pictures
without permission?

15:13.662 --> 15:14.622
Sua.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.542
<i>Is this a joke to you?</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:20.586
<i>You can't just bring your friend.</i>

15:21.045 --> 15:22.254
I'm sorry.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.465
Okay

15:24.548 --> 15:26.800
I see. Bye.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.765
What did he say?
Did he tell us not to come?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.600
No, he told us to come for now.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.775
-You haven't done any part-time work?
-No.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.527
You can work only
on holidays and weekends.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.487
That's right.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.284
We'll work hard.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.667
-Fill out the papers.
-Pardon?

16:00.167 --> 16:01.210
Contracts.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.880
You'll get paid by the day.
Write down your bank account carefully.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.093
Thank you.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.013
Get used to the product explanations.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.182
-Okay.
-Look at that guy.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.517
He's too handsome.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.397
The girl's face isn't so realistic either.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.823
-Doesn't it look delicious?
-Yes.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.200
Here.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.128
No one would come at this hour.
They all went home.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.172
I'll just feed myself.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.191
It's delicious!

17:13.866 --> 17:17.911
Look at this lovey-dovey couple!

17:23.000 --> 17:26.002
Since when did you start going out?
Has it been a long time?

17:27.003 --> 17:27.880
That's not it.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.174
Is that right?

17:30.591 --> 17:32.259
Then do you want to feed me too?

17:35.929 --> 17:37.765
Hurry up.
You said you aren't dating.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.524
It's delicious. Keep it up.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.075
-What are you reading?
-I got a part-time job.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.035
I have to learn this.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.621
Can you memorize the details
by reading that fast?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.291
I'm good at memorizing.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.296
I'll go to bed first.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.131
Brush your teeth or they'll rot.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.269
Today's menu is delicious tuna sashimi.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.522
Do you see this?

18:27.689 --> 18:28.565
DOVELY TV

18:28.649 --> 18:30.400
DOVELY HAS TURNED ON HER BROADCAST.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.236
IT LOOKS LIKE TUNA SASHIMI.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.240
I'll take a piece...

18:37.116 --> 18:38.909
and dip it into this soy sauce.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.581
I CAN'T WAIT

18:44.665 --> 18:46.333
I FEEL SATISFIED BY WATCHING YOU EAT

18:46.416 --> 18:47.793
IS THAT EXPENSIVE?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.753
IS THAT A LIMITED EDITION BAG?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.839
AWESOME. HOW DID YOU GET THE BAG?

18:54.091 --> 18:55.509
I got it as a gift.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.636
THE TUNA HAS LOST OUR ATTENTION

18:57.719 --> 18:59.888
WHY DO YOU LOOK UPSET
WITH THE EXPENSIVE BAG?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.307
ARE YOU REALLY A HIGH SCHOOLER?

19:07.688 --> 19:10.107
KYUNG-SEOK

19:11.191 --> 19:12.192
Hold on.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.659
-Hello?
-Have you had dinner?

19:23.036 --> 19:25.205
Who are you? Do you know me?

19:26.915 --> 19:29.543
You sound all right. I'm relieved.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.420
Who says you can feel relieved?

19:32.337 --> 19:33.547
Why did you move out?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.972
Let's meet up and talk tomorrow.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.141
Not tomorrow. I have to go
to my part-time job.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.058
<i>Part-time job?</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:47.811
You're working part-time? Where?

19:50.772 --> 19:53.317
At an interior design store? Where is it?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.652
I'll call you again. Don't skip meals.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.489
Brush your teeth or they'll rot.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.749
What is he saying?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.173
Aren't we going anywhere
during the break, my friend?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.091
It's already late to book a place.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.345
I don't think I can go.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.223
I still have my surgery installments
to pay.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.516
I should at least earn some pocket money.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.727
Let's make it cheap and short.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.896
It's a shame to waste our time like this.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.236
ACTIVITIES

20:37.319 --> 20:40.239
Check everything
you want to do from this list.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.951
VIEWS IN HONG KONG

20:44.034 --> 20:46.119
BEST NATURE IN HONG KONG

20:46.245 --> 20:48.664
Oh, I want to do everything.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.042
I'll earn money and go on a trip
during my winter break.

20:53.001 --> 20:57.589
By the way, why are you putting on
a facial mask for a part-time job?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.261
Is it a blind date?

21:04.513 --> 21:05.389
What?

21:16.525 --> 21:19.152
-Do you have a blind date?
-No, I'm going to work.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.447
Did you sign a contract?
You have to be careful with that.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.033
I did already.
Mi-rae was good at it.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.162
Are you working with her?

21:29.746 --> 21:31.623
Yes, why?

21:35.919 --> 21:36.920
Well...

21:37.796 --> 21:40.882
I think you have to come home early today.

21:41.091 --> 21:45.345
You have to clean the house,
the toilet, and the rooftop.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.222
And laundry, too.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.558
You said the laundry was
once every two days.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.767
Well...

21:51.476 --> 21:54.062
I mean, the blankets.
You have to wash the blankets.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.607
Blanket laundry was in the contract, too?

21:57.691 --> 22:00.652
Of course,
blanket laundry is included in laundry.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.491
-This feels somewhat evil.
-What?

22:07.117 --> 22:08.535
Evil?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.831
You're becoming more rude as days go by.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.464
Oh, hello.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.138
Hi.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.434
You didn't have to bring all these.

22:32.976 --> 22:37.230
I felt sorry for having fun without giving
you any housewarming gifts last time.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.859
I can't eat all of that by myself.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.112
Why would you have to eat it all yourself?

22:44.237 --> 22:45.989
You have to share it with Woo-young.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.619
We're paying for our food separately.
That's written in the contract.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.122
You shouldn't do that with food.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.375
Two guys can finish this much easily.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.292
Right.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.002
That's what the contract says.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.222
We'll take care of this matter.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.894
So do I still have to wash the blankets?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.690
I think you can do it later.

23:39.209 --> 23:42.337
This is grapefruit-scented,
and the other is mandarin-scented.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.048
Which one should I wear?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.343
They're both fruit-scented.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.887
<i>Wear that perfume.</i>

24:11.324 --> 24:12.242
Ms. Na.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.000
Hello.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.669
I heard you have a shift today. Get in.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.337
You don't have to give her a ride.

24:32.095 --> 24:32.929
Get in.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.813
I'm sorry about the other day.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.191
I drank more than I can handle.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.276
Don't worry about it at all.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.738
Even I have passed out and thrown up
when I got very drunk.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.622
Oh, right.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.125
Everyone gave positive feedback
about the candle you sent.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.044
I forgot to tell you.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.712
Oh, really?

25:05.795 --> 25:08.048
Our lab said
that the scent ratio is amazing.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.218
It'd be good for you
to consult them in person.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.928
I'd be so grateful.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.306
When does your lunch break start?
Shall we have lunch together?

25:17.015 --> 25:20.352
Well, I'm not sure
when our lunch break is yet.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.103
Anything you want to eat?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.730
We're on our way to work.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.024
Yes, I know.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.986
I wouldn't bother you guys at work.
I'll just drop you off and leave.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.488
Okay.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.658
When will you be done?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.622
I just wanted to tell you
to get home safely.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.591
Hello.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.928
Our showroom provides you
with a one-stop shopping experience.

25:55.011 --> 25:58.723
From doors to kitchen units,
you'll find all furniture pieces here.

25:58.807 --> 26:02.227
Please browse around and let me know
if you have any questions.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.728
Good. That was great.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.856
Even when a customer asks you
about hings you don't know,

26:06.982 --> 26:09.150
be friendly and keep a smile on your face.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.861
You can just ask me or the team for help.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.989
-Are we all good?
-Yes, sir.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.742
And you two will get the same title
as everyone else here.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.452
You're our interior curators.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.871
Everyone, let's get to work.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.255
Thank you.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.488
What are you doing here?

26:55.572 --> 26:57.616
So you actually got a part-time job.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.422
They want to know more
about Kelun's marketing strategy.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.883
I prepared our answer
with regards to that.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.593
Would you like to take a look?

27:19.346 --> 27:22.265
Reading off this will make me look
less credible.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.226
You guys have been updating me on it,

27:25.310 --> 27:27.020
so I'll just say what I think.

27:27.103 --> 27:27.937
Okay.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.398
Here's our menu.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.483
Thank you.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.276
Whenever you're ready.

27:35.570 --> 27:39.115
Then you'll come up with the answer
yourself...

27:39.199 --> 27:40.742
Would he be around 20?

27:41.159 --> 27:41.993
Pardon me?

27:42.077 --> 27:45.080
He looks young.
He must be a part-timer, right?

27:46.831 --> 27:48.500
He could be a full-time server.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.169
He doesn't look that young.
Why do you ask?

27:53.088 --> 27:54.047
I was just curious.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.185
Can we finish our meeting
by 4:00 p.m. today?

28:07.268 --> 28:08.978
Yes, that's more than enough time.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.480
Another meeting after?

28:11.189 --> 28:12.565
I have to go somewhere.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.363
So she's your little sister.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.407
I've been wondering who she was.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.327
-Do you two live together?
-No.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.747
-Where are you staying?
-I told you. I live with a senior.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.503
I'm not a senior. I'm a freshman as well.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.964
It's nice to meet you.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.426
Likewise, but I probably won't see you
after this.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.593
Sorry?

28:40.677 --> 28:43.179
I'm going abroad to study
after our dad's election,

28:43.304 --> 28:45.223
to escape from my bad grades.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.435
Don't go if you don't want to.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.603
I'll talk to Dad again.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.152
What do you want to eat?

29:02.490 --> 29:04.075
They don't have lunch combo.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.786
I want pork cutlet
as well as hamburger steak.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.457
Then let's get one each and share.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.210
What about you?

29:15.128 --> 29:16.463
I'll get pork cutlet, too.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.470
YOUNGLIM INDUSTRIES

30:22.946 --> 30:23.947
I'll be off, then.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.659
Go in first.
I'm going to see her off.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.162
It's okay. The bus stop is so close.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.372
I'm off.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.373
Kyung-hee.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.958
Bye.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.465
She's very independent.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.259
Shall we?

31:20.003 --> 31:20.879
Kyung-hee.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.191
Pass me the white plates.

31:49.073 --> 31:49.991
Why are you smiling?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.786
You're quite sweet as a big brother.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.459
Then you can call me a sweetheart.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.795
-What?
-Kyung-seok.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.964
Spare me a moment.

32:05.048 --> 32:05.882
Sure.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.053
What was that about?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.889
I had no idea he could be that cheesy.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.477
Have you been well?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.862
You must be surprised.
I know that this is very sudden.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.368
I'm sorry.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.912
The moment I saw you,

32:36.287 --> 32:38.498
all I could think was
that I had to talk to you.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.416
Why are you back?

32:42.919 --> 32:44.671
What did you come here to say?

32:48.716 --> 32:51.219
I want to say that I'm sorry.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.559
I'm sorry about everything.

32:59.769 --> 33:03.106
I should've taken you guys with me
at all costs back then.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.860
Everything I say will sound like
an excuse, but--

33:07.944 --> 33:08.778
"But"?

33:09.153 --> 33:10.071
Ma'am.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.157
Whatever you say now

33:13.241 --> 33:15.451
won't change the fact
that you abandoned us.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.870
Just because of a man.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.667
You had an affair and left your kids
and husband for another man.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.377
That fact won't change.

33:26.963 --> 33:27.839
I had an affair?

33:29.007 --> 33:32.051
-What are you...
-That face can't charm men anymore?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.600
What's with that look on your face?

33:40.643 --> 33:42.645
Why are you acting like a victim?

33:44.105 --> 33:45.314
It is worse for me.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.608
Me...

33:48.359 --> 33:49.819
and Kyung-seok.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.239
I pity our lives.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.545
Crying won't solve anything.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.391
Kyung-seok.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.164
Bye.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.042
Mi-rae, are you getting off work?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.126
Yes.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.920
-How's the work?
-It's okay.

34:50.004 --> 34:50.963
Do you have time?

34:51.589 --> 34:53.966
No, I'm sorry. My friend's waiting for me.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.554
Let's go.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.473
What did he say?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.518
Mr. Park?

35:03.935 --> 35:06.938
He asked if the job's okay
and said that he'd treat me to a meal.

35:07.021 --> 35:07.897
Let's go.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.616
Five days' pay will be enough
to last me a month.

35:18.699 --> 35:19.951
YOUNGLIM DEPOSITED 100,000 WON

35:22.703 --> 35:24.705
-You need to pay rent, right?
-Yes.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.582
-How much is it?
-70,000 won.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.292
-A month?
-Yes.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.921
That's so cheap.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.465
It's not like he's doing charity work.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.593
I do all the housework.

35:37.677 --> 35:41.472
I think he's doing it so that
you won't have to pay that much.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.474
What a nice offer.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.977
He's such a nice senior.

35:54.110 --> 35:54.944
Hello?

35:55.361 --> 35:57.280
-Are you done?
<i>-Yes.</i>

35:57.405 --> 35:59.365
Hurry up.
You have a lot of work to do.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.079
Are you hungry?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.666
Then I'll buy some pork belly on the way.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.503
Do you pay for food?

36:13.087 --> 36:14.630
We share whatever we buy.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.302
By the way,

36:20.261 --> 36:21.888
where can I buy pork belly?

36:22.930 --> 36:23.764
What?

36:30.354 --> 36:33.274
Why is he going to buy pork belly
when we already have beef?

36:34.442 --> 36:36.277
-Pork belly, please.
-Okay.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.782
No, not that one.
We'll take the one behind that.

36:43.951 --> 36:44.785
Thank you.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.414
Thank you.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.877
Why did you choose this one?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.923
It's not good
when the fat color is yellow.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.508
It needs to be light pink like this one.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.011
Where did you learn that?

37:02.762 --> 37:04.138
This is all basic knowledge.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.849
I have gone grocery shopping with my mom
since I was young.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.812
Some vegetables for wraps?

37:11.896 --> 37:12.730
Yes.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.330
Mi-rae gets drunk
on three glasses of soju.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.124
And he gets drunk on two.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.508
Hey.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.852
Did... Did you take Mi-rae home safely?

37:52.603 --> 37:54.772
Yes, I tucked her into bed.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.651
What?

38:13.165 --> 38:15.376
MORNING DEW, PURE WAVE

38:22.591 --> 38:24.552
-You should come, too.
-Go with you?

38:24.635 --> 38:27.555
I got a job thanks to you,
so I should treat you to a meal.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.349
We need more pork.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.978
Hyun-jung will be waiting for me at home.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.314
Then tell her to come as well.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.402
<i>Why is he being so kind?</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:47.158
Do Sang-won will brighten your lives!

38:48.909 --> 38:50.661
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.496
Thank you for your work.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.790
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.012
Can we talk?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.599
You're not as well-mannered as before.

39:11.682 --> 39:15.436
You're the one who's ill-mannered
for lying to our children

39:16.103 --> 39:21.108
that their mother left home
because she had an affair with a guy.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.860
I have people working for me here.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.863
Will you please excuse us?

39:26.572 --> 39:28.657
This won't help with his election.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.203
Please excuse us.

39:33.037 --> 39:33.913
Okay, sir.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.388
You're pretty good now.
Did you practice?

39:51.722 --> 39:52.681
No.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.850
What's so hard about this?

39:55.643 --> 39:57.353
He picked it up quickly
because I taught him.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.188
He just doesn't know a lot.

39:59.688 --> 40:00.815
I'll do it now.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.819
I'm not dumb. I know...

40:05.528 --> 40:10.408
you made up stories about me
to give yourself an advantage.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.244
I held things in...

40:13.786 --> 40:16.288
because I felt sorry for the kids,
not for you.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.749
But this is way out of line.

40:19.708 --> 40:22.128
I don't care what others think about me.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.797
I can't stand my kids getting
the wrong idea.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.342
The wrong idea?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.262
What exactly is wrong?

40:33.097 --> 40:34.181
Seriously?

40:34.265 --> 40:37.810
What's the point of correcting the story?
Do you think anything will change?

40:40.271 --> 40:41.981
This is a fact to them.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.400
For whatever reason,
their mom abandoned them.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.362
And their dad protected them until now.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.322
That will never change.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.038
You're way too brazen.

41:00.207 --> 41:05.212
Do you want me to leave it to the public
to judge what you did to me

41:05.796 --> 41:07.298
by stating the facts?

41:12.136 --> 41:13.179
Are you threatening me?

41:13.262 --> 41:15.764
You feel that way
because you have something to hide.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.100
What do you say?

41:18.184 --> 41:21.479
I'd wreck your entire career
if I could have things my way.

41:22.771 --> 41:23.981
I'm giving you a chance.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.692
Tell our kids...

41:27.610 --> 41:28.694
the truth.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.541
-It's so delicious.
-I know.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.752
How can pork belly taste so good?

41:44.835 --> 41:46.462
It's good, right? Eat up.

41:46.545 --> 41:47.838
Why are you being proud?

41:47.922 --> 41:49.340
I'm grilling it, as you see.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.220
I'm sure it's good-quality meat,

41:54.303 --> 41:57.014
but it tastes even better
because you're grilling it for us.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.766
Yes, you grill meat so well.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.233
Here.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.984
Have a glass of soju.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.403
Mi-rae probably won't drink.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.657
Me neither. I prefer cola when I eat meat.

42:15.824 --> 42:18.077
-You're going to drink, right?
-I don't feel like it.

42:18.827 --> 42:19.662
Why?

42:20.287 --> 42:22.623
Is it because you collapsed
after two shots?

42:24.750 --> 42:27.419
What... What are you talking about?

42:27.503 --> 42:28.671
Me? You?

42:30.130 --> 42:33.425
I... I only fell asleep
because it was time to sleep.

42:35.469 --> 42:36.845
You must have low stamina.

42:37.471 --> 42:39.223
Did you just question my stamina?

42:40.766 --> 42:42.434
My nickname is Yeon Stamina.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.478
-You mean Weak Stamina?
-Is that a joke?

42:44.937 --> 42:47.147
That was really lame.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.148
It wasn't a joke.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.234
I saw you collapse after two shots.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.365
Kyung-seok.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.535
One's ability to drink has nothing to do
with stamina.

42:59.618 --> 43:04.123
There are guys who can drink even though
they're really skinny and weak like you.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.374
What did you just say?

43:11.672 --> 43:12.631
What's going on?

43:15.467 --> 43:17.803
Judging by the conversation,

43:17.886 --> 43:19.972
we should hold a stamina competition.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.642
-What?
-You guys should arm wrestle like a man.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.230
Gosh, come on. His arm will break.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.274
You must be scared.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.822
Gosh, stop running your mouth.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.532
Arm wrestling, it is.

43:41.452 --> 43:42.828
Both are right-handed?

43:42.911 --> 43:44.121
-Yes.
-Yes.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.040
Okay, then that's a fair fight.

43:46.123 --> 43:48.417
I think Woo-young will win.
What about you?

43:49.209 --> 43:50.044
Well...

43:56.550 --> 43:57.843
I'm not sure.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.767
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.770
No important schedule tomorrow?

44:08.520 --> 44:10.356
You'll be in pain for a while.

44:10.439 --> 44:13.150
Kyung-hee, your father is home.

45:07.454 --> 45:09.206
One of them might break his arm.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.041
This is fun.
Should we do it, too?

45:13.460 --> 45:14.461
He is winning.

45:16.380 --> 45:17.923
Gosh, it's so nerve-racking!

45:18.382 --> 45:19.758
-A little more.
-Go for it.

45:19.842 --> 45:20.676
Almost there.

45:30.728 --> 45:34.189
I told you Woo-young would win.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.027
You're stronger than I thought, though.

45:41.196 --> 45:44.658
Don't be so down.
You can beat others later.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.705
Right, Kyung-seok. You did well.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.876
Why would you depress him even more?

46:02.509 --> 46:05.512
Anyway, she was the one
who left you behind.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.475
Still, I wouldn't have had to resent her
that much.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.020
I thought...

46:14.438 --> 46:16.523
she was such a horrible person.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.402
Why did you make me keep that prejudice?

46:21.487 --> 46:25.574
Who are you to turn my mom
into that kind of a person?

46:27.326 --> 46:28.202
Get out.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.746
Get out!

46:35.042 --> 46:36.960
Let's talk later, once you calm down.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.649
We're leaving. Bye.

46:58.732 --> 47:00.359
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

47:01.735 --> 47:03.320
Thank you for the meal. Bye.

47:12.037 --> 47:13.372
Go home safely.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.249
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

47:15.332 --> 47:16.333
Come again.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.424
I can do it today if you want.

47:24.508 --> 47:25.801
It's okay.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.683
Is your arm okay?
If it hurts, go see a doctor.

47:45.404 --> 47:46.280
Here.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.703
Kyung-seok was in a bad mood.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.081
I guess arm-wrestling is a big deal
in the world of men.

47:56.164 --> 47:58.917
If it's in front of someone he likes.

48:00.836 --> 48:03.881
As I see it, he looked like
he had feelings for you.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.886
It's just that he's finally got a friend
after a long time.

48:10.345 --> 48:14.099
Still, what will you do
if he does like you?

48:16.143 --> 48:19.354
No one would dare reject
someone so handsome like him.

48:24.610 --> 48:27.446
Someone so handsome like him isn't
my type of man.

48:29.865 --> 48:31.283
My ideal type of man...

48:32.242 --> 48:37.247
is someone with an average appearance
who is okay with my plastic surgeries.

48:37.831 --> 48:41.793
Someone who isn't so tall, so rich,

48:41.877 --> 48:43.921
or so popular.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.675
That's pretty picky.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.303
Right?

48:52.346 --> 48:53.680
What about you?

48:56.892 --> 48:59.561
Someone who looks neat?

49:01.438 --> 49:02.356
For example?

49:04.191 --> 49:05.233
Well...

49:06.693 --> 49:08.111
Someone like Woo-young.

49:11.949 --> 49:12.908
You're right.

49:14.034 --> 49:17.204
Woo-young fits that criterion.

49:19.998 --> 49:23.126
Don't you think your standard is
a bit too high?

49:23.669 --> 49:24.753
I know.

49:24.836 --> 49:28.215
This must be why neither of us can
date anyone. Don't you think so?

49:29.341 --> 49:30.509
Tell me about it.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.192
Hello?

49:48.026 --> 49:49.319
Hey, this is Sua.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.779
<i>What's up?</i>

49:52.114 --> 49:54.199
I'm calling just because I'm bored.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.623
Have you decided to work part-time
with Kyung-seok?

50:03.500 --> 50:04.459
Yes.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.714
I have something to tell you.

50:08.797 --> 50:10.924
Spare me some time to talk on Monday.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.010
See you at school.

50:23.812 --> 50:24.813
Who was it?

50:25.856 --> 50:27.733
-Hyun Sua.
-That weird girl?

50:27.816 --> 50:29.776
I think she's really weird.

50:29.860 --> 50:33.488
I just can't believe she invited
Yong-cheol over without knowing.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.622
Sir, this is bad!

50:46.418 --> 50:49.504
I think Kyung-hee has run away from home.

50:59.806 --> 51:01.141
Did you have a good night?

51:01.349 --> 51:04.686
Your schedule today is busier
than any other days.

51:05.937 --> 51:07.397
Kyung-hee ran away from home.

51:07.481 --> 51:08.398
What?

51:09.691 --> 51:12.069
Look for her without letting others know.

51:12.652 --> 51:13.487
Yes, sir.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.675
<i>He's so handsome again.</i>

51:37.594 --> 51:40.472
<i>This isn't an ordinary sight of someone</i>
<i>going to work.</i>

51:53.527 --> 51:54.945
Why are you standing there?

52:01.076 --> 52:02.577
Oh, I'm coming.

52:12.879 --> 52:15.048
You seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.508
Are you feeling better now?

52:19.344 --> 52:20.387
The arm wrestling.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.806
I went easy on him.

52:23.723 --> 52:27.102
He gave me a good deal on rent,
so I should do at least do that much.

52:30.188 --> 52:32.440
I see. Okay.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.404
Just a second.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.408
Hi, Mom.

52:41.491 --> 52:42.993
Do you have another shift today?

52:44.244 --> 52:46.413
We're coming to drop off some food.

52:47.122 --> 52:48.165
Working again today?

52:49.124 --> 52:51.126
She probably doesn't make much in a day.

52:51.209 --> 52:52.460
100,000 won a day.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.755
All right, then. Take it easy.

52:58.967 --> 53:00.844
-Shall we visit her at work?
-Gosh.

53:02.220 --> 53:03.263
Do you know where it is?

53:03.972 --> 53:05.056
I sure do.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.816
Feel free to browse around.

53:16.401 --> 53:17.527
Mi-rae.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.531
Mom, what are you doing here?

53:21.781 --> 53:22.908
What do you think?

53:22.991 --> 53:25.327
We wanted to visit you at work.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.747
Act like a customer.
You're making her uncomfortable.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.249
Hello.

53:41.092 --> 53:43.345
Oh, Mom. He's my friend from school.

53:45.347 --> 53:46.723
I'm Do Kyung-seok.

53:48.683 --> 53:49.517
Hello.

53:52.062 --> 53:54.022
What's your relationship with Mi-rae?

53:56.942 --> 53:58.485
She just said they're friends.

53:59.110 --> 54:01.488
Yes, she's my closest friend
in our department.

54:06.743 --> 54:07.577
Excuse me.

54:10.163 --> 54:10.997
Yes, ma'am.

54:17.671 --> 54:20.340
Does this chair come in different colors?

54:26.763 --> 54:28.932
Shouldn't a guy like him become an actor?

54:30.058 --> 54:32.394
How can someone be that handsome?

54:32.894 --> 54:34.312
That is just not fair.

54:35.021 --> 54:35.981
All right.

54:38.191 --> 54:41.111
-I'll call you later.
-All right, go back inside.

54:44.698 --> 54:47.158
See? Don't you think
the surgery was a good idea?

54:48.285 --> 54:51.413
She can be friends with a guy like that
now that she's pretty.

54:51.746 --> 54:54.541
Isn't that girl who just walked by
a Gangnam beauty?

54:54.958 --> 54:57.127
Totally. She's a typical Gangnam beauty.

55:13.393 --> 55:16.646
Not even just a beauty.
They called her a Gangnam beauty.

55:17.105 --> 55:20.775
Everyone's obsessed with Gangnam.
They associate everything nice with it.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.819
-Let's go to a department store.
-What?

55:22.902 --> 55:25.113
Actually, should I go to a hair salon?

55:25.530 --> 55:28.742
I must look good enough
to call myself Mi-rae's mom.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.452
Like those ladies in Gangnam.

55:33.872 --> 55:36.166
I'm due for a haircut, too.

55:38.501 --> 55:39.461
Mi-rae.

55:41.921 --> 55:43.590
Good work today.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.467
-I guess you work out a lot.
-Sorry?

55:45.550 --> 55:47.010
You look very fit.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.731
Did he ask you out for a meal again?

56:00.648 --> 56:02.942
No, he asked me
if I find anything stressful.

56:03.526 --> 56:04.361
Let's go.

56:14.162 --> 56:15.038
Hello?

56:19.918 --> 56:21.002
Did something happen?

56:28.885 --> 56:32.972
You must've resented me to the point
that you can't even talk about it.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.934
Kyung-hee is right.

56:37.143 --> 56:39.187
Regardless of what I say now,

56:39.687 --> 56:40.897
nothing will change.

56:42.607 --> 56:44.067
No matter how much I apologize,

56:45.568 --> 56:47.904
I can't go back and hold you two
in my arms.

56:49.489 --> 56:53.368
I can't turn back the hands of time
and change what happened.

56:54.869 --> 56:55.703
But...

56:57.122 --> 57:00.542
I want you to know that I didn't leave you
for another man.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.753
That is really not true.

57:08.216 --> 57:09.592
I'm sorry.

57:11.094 --> 57:13.179
It must've been much harder for you two.

57:15.140 --> 57:16.516
In all those years...

57:18.101 --> 57:19.477
It must've been so tough.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.610
Yes, it was hard.

57:32.073 --> 57:33.575
And I did resent you a little.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.166
But you see,

57:43.793 --> 57:46.004
I don't want any of us
to be in pain anymore.

57:55.221 --> 57:56.222
Mom.

58:28.254 --> 58:29.339
Thanks.

58:31.758 --> 58:32.967
Thanks so much.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.017
And I'm sorry.

58:43.311 --> 58:44.646
I must look shameless now.

58:47.357 --> 58:49.692
I'm sorry
that I can't hide how happy I am.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.887
Did something happen to Ms. Na?

59:18.763 --> 59:20.473
No, she's fine.

59:22.016 --> 59:24.561
I see. I'm glad she's fine.

59:29.190 --> 59:30.692
By the way,

59:31.734 --> 59:33.570
-do people cry out of joy?
-What?

59:33.987 --> 59:36.030
Have you ever cried tears of joy?

59:39.576 --> 59:42.453
Yes, when I found out
that I got into Hankook University.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.667
Why do you ask?
It's never happened to you?

59:47.959 --> 59:49.085
I'm not sure.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.256
I guess you've never been that happy.

59:53.798 --> 59:54.757
Maybe not.

59:56.718 --> 59:57.552
Shall we go?

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:11.232
I'm not sure if it's enough
to make me cry, but...

1:00:11.316 --> 1:00:12.150
What?

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:15.486
I'm happy that we met again like this.

1:00:18.781 --> 1:00:20.700
<i>Do you really have feelings for me?</i>

1:00:21.659 --> 1:00:24.412
<i>If you keep doing this,</i>
<i>I'll totally fall for you.</i>

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:28.207
Hyun-jung must be waiting for me.

1:00:28.666 --> 1:00:30.001
Let's hurry.

1:00:44.098 --> 1:00:46.809
<i>I'm at school now. Where are you?</i>

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:08.039
How's your part-time job?

1:01:10.541 --> 1:01:11.542
It's been pretty good.

1:01:13.961 --> 1:01:15.838
Will Kyung-seok keep working there?

1:01:16.964 --> 1:01:18.007
I think so.

1:01:20.385 --> 1:01:23.638
Do they need another part-timer
by any chance?

1:01:23.721 --> 1:01:24.555
What?

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:27.684
I think it'll be fun
to work with you and Kyung-seok.

1:01:32.063 --> 1:01:35.775
What's wrong?
Will that make you uncomfortable?

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:39.862
No, it's not that.

1:01:41.572 --> 1:01:42.990
I'll look into it for you.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.329
To tell you the truth,

1:01:50.331 --> 1:01:51.833
I like Kyung-seok.

1:01:58.131 --> 1:01:59.590
Can you help me?

1:02:01.968 --> 1:02:03.219
Well...

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:06.931
I don't think I can help you with that.

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:08.266
Why not?

1:02:08.808 --> 1:02:11.936
I'm asking you
because you're his closest friend.

1:02:14.230 --> 1:02:15.398
Do you...

1:02:16.607 --> 1:02:18.234
have a crush on him, too?

1:02:22.071 --> 1:02:23.156
No way. Do you?

1:02:24.699 --> 1:02:25.783
<i>What's the problem?</i>

1:02:26.367 --> 1:02:28.453
<i>Am I not allowed to like him or what?</i>

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:33.499
You won't need my help.

1:02:34.208 --> 1:02:37.962
You're bright, active, and pretty--

1:02:38.045 --> 1:02:39.088
You're pretty, too.

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:41.007
What?

1:02:41.883 --> 1:02:43.050
Are you guys going out?

1:02:43.134 --> 1:02:44.969
Why do you think so?

1:02:45.052 --> 1:02:47.597
You're popular among guys as well

1:02:48.473 --> 1:02:49.766
because you're pretty.

1:02:53.394 --> 1:02:54.771
I think...

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:58.608
it's a blessing to be pretty,
don't you think?

1:03:01.861 --> 1:03:03.321
People naturally like you.

1:03:04.447 --> 1:03:07.283
That must be why those who aren't blessed

1:03:07.366 --> 1:03:10.745
get plastic surgeries
to enjoy that kind of benefit,

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.541
harming the ones who were born pretty.

1:03:16.584 --> 1:03:17.960
Harm?

1:03:19.587 --> 1:03:20.630
I mean,

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:24.675
pretty faces become less rare
because of plastic surgeries.

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:36.020
I thought I was mistaken...

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:41.359
and that I was at fault
for judging you in a bad way.

1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:43.986
But I wasn't mistaken.

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:49.784
You've hated me...

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:52.036
from the beginning.
