WEBVTT

01:56.226 --> 01:57.271
Elizabeth.

02:02.494 --> 02:03.538
Who are you?

02:04.452 --> 02:05.410
How did you get in?

02:06.715 --> 02:09.109
Do exactly as I say.
Come here.

02:19.989 --> 02:22.296
Unless you want me
to go to Frankie's bedroom.

02:24.951 --> 02:26.213
Did you understand...

02:26.953 --> 02:27.997
what I said?

02:29.521 --> 02:30.565
Put it down.

02:31.653 --> 02:32.654
Now.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.352
There you go.

02:35.396 --> 02:36.397
Adam...

02:50.629 --> 02:52.065
What do you want from us?

02:54.850 --> 02:56.504
Just swallow these.

02:58.811 --> 03:01.378
-Uh-huh.
-No. No.

03:02.075 --> 03:03.729
-Adam.

03:08.690 --> 03:09.952
Are you listening to me?

03:11.127 --> 03:12.607
Are you listening to me?

03:13.608 --> 03:15.610
-Hear this.

03:18.874 --> 03:20.528
You can swallow these...

03:21.486 --> 03:23.183
or I can go down the hall...

03:24.358 --> 03:26.142
and visit your son Frankie.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.017
-Understand?

03:53.735 --> 03:56.999
-You wanna
make this easier, or...

04:03.266 --> 04:04.267
There you go.

04:32.905 --> 04:33.949
Almost through.

04:50.879 --> 04:52.185
I count four more.

04:54.056 --> 04:55.057
One.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.105
Down it goes.

05:00.846 --> 05:01.847
Two.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.200
-Three.

05:30.092 --> 05:31.833
There.

05:31.877 --> 05:33.400
That wasn't too hard,
was it?

06:30.370 --> 06:33.634
Frankie... you lucky boy.

06:37.507 --> 06:38.595
Shh.

07:16.808 --> 07:17.765
Blade.

08:19.479 --> 08:21.002
We shouldn't be here, Jeff.

08:21.046 --> 08:22.787
Jesus, Kelly.
We've been over this
ten times already.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.267
Yeah, I know. But your
theory is holding on
by a fucking thread.

08:25.311 --> 08:27.139
No wonder Captain Martel
ignored your request for...

08:27.182 --> 08:28.793
Captain Martel is gonna
be retired,

08:28.836 --> 08:30.272
so he can't hold out on us
in less than a month.

08:30.316 --> 08:31.360
I'm not gonna
bet our future on him.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.720
MAN: Who is it?

08:43.764 --> 08:46.332
LAPD. Just wanna ask you
a few questions.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.420
Told you he was here.

09:08.484 --> 09:10.008
MAN: What're you doing?
I'll fucking kill you!

09:10.051 --> 09:12.010
-Oh, yeah?

09:19.669 --> 09:20.975
KELLY: All right.
I'll drop you off first,

09:21.019 --> 09:22.411
and then I'll take
this sweetheart in.

09:23.238 --> 09:24.979
Tomorrow's a big day.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.546
You need your beauty sleep.

09:26.589 --> 09:27.982
JEFF: Put your head down.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.418
You sure you don't
want my help?

09:29.462 --> 09:31.638
No, I'm good.
Thank you... Captain.

09:31.681 --> 09:34.075
Hey, don't jinx it.
And listen, do me a favor.

09:34.119 --> 09:36.338
Liz wants me to get home safe
tonight, so I'm gonna drive.

09:37.557 --> 09:39.124
-All right.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.386
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.109
JEFF: Careful.

10:57.071 --> 10:59.726
-Hey, buddy.
-I had a nightmare.

11:01.032 --> 11:02.381
That's no good.
Come here.

11:04.644 --> 11:05.688
You okay?

11:05.732 --> 11:08.561
I dreamt a bad guy
came to my room.

11:09.605 --> 11:10.780
A bad guy?

11:10.824 --> 11:12.434
Okay, well,
I can promise you

11:12.478 --> 11:15.263
that there are no bad guys
in your room, okay?

11:20.399 --> 11:21.617
What do you think that is?

11:21.661 --> 11:23.750
Mommy made you a surprise.

11:23.793 --> 11:25.578
She did?

11:25.621 --> 11:27.493
Well, if it's a surprise,
you're not supposed
to tell me about it.

11:29.451 --> 11:31.366
JEFF: Okay, let's take
a look at this.

11:38.983 --> 11:40.245
"I'm so proud of you."

11:49.558 --> 11:50.559
It's beautiful.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.605
So bright.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.130
Hey.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.480
Let's not tell Mommy
you told me, all right?

11:58.524 --> 12:00.134
-I promise.
-Okay, good.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.049
Now, come here.
Let me get you to bed.

12:02.093 --> 12:03.746
Let's go find Mommy.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.226
Where's Mommy, hmm?

12:05.270 --> 12:07.054
Where'd she go?
Is she hiding on us?

12:07.098 --> 12:09.056
Where is she?

12:09.970 --> 12:12.886
Maybe she's in the living room.

12:15.106 --> 12:16.498
Nope, not in here.

12:16.542 --> 12:17.891
Let's go check the bedroom.

12:24.550 --> 12:27.161
Oh, where could she be?

12:40.479 --> 12:42.220
Is she in here?

12:54.623 --> 12:56.103
Oh, my...

12:56.147 --> 12:57.409
What is it?

13:01.717 --> 13:03.719
Nothing, buddy.
She's not here.

13:06.113 --> 13:08.942
Okay, Frankie.
Listen to me for a second.

13:08.985 --> 13:10.900
I need you to go
to sleep for me.

13:10.944 --> 13:13.077
Right now, okay? Okay.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.085
Liz. Liz.

14:53.002 --> 14:54.482
MAN OVER RADIO:
We have a Code 1056

14:54.526 --> 14:57.311
at 10622 Magnolia Boulevard.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.280
Hey, guys, let me see the body?

15:53.324 --> 15:55.543
-For a second.
-Yeah, sure thing, Detective.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.420
I guess his new tie
didn't fit right?

16:05.074 --> 16:07.599
Come here a second.
I... I don't know
if I heard you right.

16:07.642 --> 16:10.558
Say it again. Huh?
Is this a fucking joke to you?

16:10.602 --> 16:13.126
-Hey, man. I was just...
-Hey, Detective! That's enough!

16:13.169 --> 16:14.780
That's enough!

16:14.823 --> 16:16.390
Okay.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.392
-With all due respect, sir...
-I'm good.

16:20.002 --> 16:21.047
I'm good.

16:26.357 --> 16:28.315
What's his problem?

16:28.359 --> 16:31.013
His wife killed herself
three months ago.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.625
He's been prowling 1056s
ever since.

16:34.408 --> 16:35.714
What's 1056?

16:36.323 --> 16:37.803
Suicide scenes.

16:39.935 --> 16:41.763
Oh, Christ, poor dude.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.199
Yeah, well...

16:43.243 --> 16:44.679
Just take care of the body.

16:59.738 --> 17:01.914
You asked to see me,
Your Highness?

17:01.957 --> 17:04.699
Don't call me that.
I didn't steal your job.

17:04.742 --> 17:06.092
I took the damn job

17:06.135 --> 17:07.528
because you threw it
down the toilet.

17:10.138 --> 17:11.750
Two more men filed
reports against you.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.231
Oh, yeah?

17:15.797 --> 17:17.146
Uh, which two?

17:18.409 --> 17:20.236
They call you
"The Suicide Guy," Jeff.

17:22.455 --> 17:23.588
What do you want me to say?

17:25.023 --> 17:26.286
Look.

17:26.329 --> 17:27.896
All you've been doing
since it happened

17:27.940 --> 17:29.637
is skulk around
suicide scenes.

17:29.681 --> 17:32.901
It doesn't make any sense,
and I won't condone it
any longer.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.600
You've gotta get back
in the saddle.

17:35.643 --> 17:37.384
Let me team you up
with a new partner,

17:37.428 --> 17:39.430
assign you to a homicide case.

17:39.473 --> 17:41.606
You have a gift, Jeff.
Don't waste it.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.826
I am working a homicide case.

17:45.914 --> 17:47.481
-Elizabeth took her own life.
-No.

17:48.308 --> 17:49.962
She didn't.

17:50.005 --> 17:51.398
We've been through this
a hundred times...

17:51.442 --> 17:53.226
She didn't have a single
reason to kill herself.

17:53.269 --> 17:55.271
You know that.
That's not who she was.

17:56.621 --> 17:58.753
With all the respect
I have for her,

17:58.797 --> 18:01.060
her work as an artist
was very tormented.

18:01.103 --> 18:03.236
-We don't know
what was going on...
-No, I know!

18:08.981 --> 18:10.591
She was my wife.

18:11.679 --> 18:13.507
She was my best friend,
so I know.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.990
And what about Frankie, hmm?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.472
I mean, what he said that night,the nightmare he had.

18:21.515 --> 18:24.649
A man in his room.
Do you think he made
that shit up?

18:24.692 --> 18:26.520
And the two guys that I saw
on the way in that night.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.435
I asked everybody
in the fucking building,

18:28.479 --> 18:29.480
nobody knows who they are.

18:31.656 --> 18:32.961
This is shady.

18:34.136 --> 18:35.573
It's not shady...

18:36.400 --> 18:37.662
it's crazy.

18:45.713 --> 18:46.758
Okay.

20:20.982 --> 20:23.071
Freeze! Put your
hands in the air.

20:23.115 --> 20:25.509
You got me, buddy.
Come here.

20:26.379 --> 20:28.207
-Oh...
-I heard the shower

20:28.250 --> 20:30.688
-and knew it was you.
-Oh, you're always right.

20:30.731 --> 20:31.819
Can you come play?

20:33.212 --> 20:35.257
Yeah. Let me just talk
to Grandma first, okay?

20:35.301 --> 20:38.304
-And then we can play.
-Yay!

20:38.347 --> 20:39.566
I'll be right back, all right?

20:49.184 --> 20:50.185
Hey, Mom.

20:51.447 --> 20:52.448
Hi.

20:56.061 --> 20:57.584
We haven't seen you
in a while.

21:06.288 --> 21:07.768
At least you took a shower.

21:10.466 --> 21:12.599
Yeah.

21:12.643 --> 21:14.514
You're still not going back
to that apartment?

21:15.646 --> 21:16.777
No, I can't.

21:18.039 --> 21:20.172
Well, then sell the damn thing
and move on.

21:22.566 --> 21:26.004
This is a terrible example
for your son!

21:26.047 --> 21:28.267
You cannot keep coming
back here like this.

21:28.310 --> 21:29.703
Look, Frankie...

21:29.747 --> 21:32.184
He's a kid, okay? He doesn't
notice stuff like this.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.403
Oh, he doesn't?

21:34.447 --> 21:36.275
That's how little you know
about your son.

21:36.318 --> 21:37.668
He notices everything!

21:39.452 --> 21:40.714
And besides...

21:40.758 --> 21:43.499
-I notice, Jeff.
-Well, you're my mother.

21:43.543 --> 21:45.719
And you understand
what I'm going through, right?

21:45.763 --> 21:47.852
Two months ago, I understood.

21:47.895 --> 21:50.289
Now it is just self-destruction.

21:50.332 --> 21:51.812
I need one thing
from you, Mom.

21:53.292 --> 21:54.598
Be there for Frankie.

21:55.686 --> 21:56.991
I can't be, not yet.

21:58.471 --> 22:00.691
You won't bring her back
by killing yourself.

22:04.346 --> 22:05.478
There.

22:05.521 --> 22:06.610
I said it.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.614
Yeah. You said it.

22:49.304 --> 22:50.610
Are you okay, Dad?

22:52.264 --> 22:53.265
Yeah, buddy.

22:53.744 --> 22:54.745
I'm good.

23:05.233 --> 23:06.539
I love you.
You know that, right?

23:07.279 --> 23:08.672
Give me a hug. Come on.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.151
Yeah.

23:11.283 --> 23:12.676
I gotta go, okay?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.840
-Anderson. -Jeff, it's Capt... It's Kelly.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.189
You gotta get to the hospital.

23:48.755 --> 23:49.713
Now.

23:51.018 --> 23:52.541
Kelly, what's going on?

23:52.585 --> 23:54.456
Get moving. I'll brief you
on the way.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.341
Miss Wilson?

24:56.431 --> 24:58.520
I'm Detective
Jeff Anderson, LAPD.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.916
I know you're going
through something...

25:02.960 --> 25:04.265
unimaginable right now.

25:05.701 --> 25:08.879
I already, uh, told everything
to your colleagues.

25:08.922 --> 25:11.533
But I need to hear firsthand
what happened to you.

25:12.796 --> 25:13.840
In your own words.

25:19.106 --> 25:21.239
Um, my boyfriend, Mike,

25:22.066 --> 25:24.329
had left to go home.

25:26.070 --> 25:29.247
I heard the
apartment door, and...

25:30.683 --> 25:32.163
I thought maybe it was him.

25:32.946 --> 25:34.513
Maybe he forgot something.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.606
But then, two guys...

25:41.694 --> 25:42.782
came in...

25:44.001 --> 25:45.002
Um...

25:46.873 --> 25:48.266
The older one's...

25:48.919 --> 25:50.311
in his 60s.

25:51.922 --> 25:52.966
And...

25:56.187 --> 25:58.450
He looked like
he hated my guts.

26:03.585 --> 26:06.588
The younger guy
was in his 20s...

26:07.154 --> 26:08.416
and he had a gun.

26:11.767 --> 26:12.768
Um...

26:13.639 --> 26:14.770
Older guy...

26:16.903 --> 26:19.340
handed me a bottle
of sleeping pills.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.083
And...

26:24.955 --> 26:25.912
He, uh...

26:27.218 --> 26:28.262
told me, uh...

26:30.003 --> 26:31.048
"Take them."

26:32.876 --> 26:34.790
'Cause he knew where
my mother lived.

26:46.846 --> 26:47.891
And then...

26:49.849 --> 26:51.503
Mike did forget something.

26:59.293 --> 27:00.947
And then, uh,

27:00.991 --> 27:02.427
the next thing I remember is...

27:03.210 --> 27:04.472
waking up in this room.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.348
Where is Mike?

27:12.567 --> 27:13.568
Um...

27:14.743 --> 27:17.007
-This wasn't...
-I'm Jane.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.617
So, call... Call me Jane.

27:19.052 --> 27:20.053
Jane...

27:22.969 --> 27:23.927
No.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.975
No, don't say it. Don't.

27:29.019 --> 27:30.890
-Don't say it.
-They shot him.

27:34.459 --> 27:36.417
-He didn't make it.

27:41.770 --> 27:42.771
I'm sorry.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.364
-Jeff...
-No.

28:10.408 --> 28:12.192
I don't know what
to say. This is...

28:12.236 --> 28:13.846
No, this is exactly
what I've been saying
for the last six months!

28:18.807 --> 28:20.331
Look...

28:20.374 --> 28:23.377
You understand
what I have to do, right?

28:24.639 --> 28:25.945
I do.

28:41.134 --> 28:42.962
-Where's it at?
-Upstairs.

29:16.082 --> 29:17.040
They started here...

29:18.389 --> 29:19.564
and there.

33:46.918 --> 33:48.485
-Yeah.
-FRANKIE: Daddy?

33:48.528 --> 33:51.096
Frankie, hey.

33:51.139 --> 33:53.533
Hey, buddy. What're you doing?
Is Grandma with you?

33:53.577 --> 33:56.580
Are we still going
to Disneyland?

33:56.623 --> 33:57.972
No, buddy. I'm sorry.

33:58.016 --> 34:00.018
I totally forgot about that.

34:00.061 --> 34:01.498
Can we go tomorrow?

34:01.541 --> 34:03.978
No, no, no, no. Daddy's got
a lot of work right now.

34:04.022 --> 34:06.154
Are you looking for a bad guy?

34:07.242 --> 34:09.027
Two of 'em, actually.

34:09.070 --> 34:10.768
What did they do?

34:13.205 --> 34:14.902
They did some bad things.

34:14.946 --> 34:16.382
Did they kill Mom?

34:16.426 --> 34:17.427
GRANDMA: Frankie.

34:18.341 --> 34:19.994
Let Granny have the phone.

34:20.038 --> 34:23.041
I'll talk to Daddy for a minute
and you just go inside, okay?

34:23.650 --> 34:24.824
Good boy.

34:29.308 --> 34:30.570
Are you crazy?

34:30.614 --> 34:32.179
Talking about this
with your son?

34:32.224 --> 34:33.878
Mom, hey.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.837
Look, I didn't check
my caller ID, he surprised me.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.797
Frankie has been looking forwardto going to Disneyland

34:39.840 --> 34:41.842
with you today for weeks.

34:41.886 --> 34:43.366
You promised him, Jeff!

34:43.409 --> 34:45.150
Yeah, I know. Mom, Mom, look.

34:45.193 --> 34:46.804
I'll make it up to him,
I promise.

34:46.847 --> 34:48.239
That's not how
little boys think.

34:48.283 --> 34:50.851
They need a father
who they can trust

34:50.895 --> 34:51.938
and who they can depend on,

34:51.983 --> 34:53.940
not one that makes
empty promises.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.422
I got to go, Mom.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.519
I miss you.

35:16.311 --> 35:17.748
-What have you got?
-I have a theory.

35:17.791 --> 35:19.140
You always do.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.447
I found 19 prominent women
who committed suicide

35:21.491 --> 35:23.623
by slashing their wrists
in their bathtubs,

35:23.667 --> 35:25.843
after ingesting sleeping pills.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.279
All of them
in the Los Angeles area.

35:28.236 --> 35:30.195
And I only went back 10 years.

35:31.979 --> 35:33.241
Guys, give me a second.

35:34.721 --> 35:36.244
What do you mean
by "prominent women"?

35:36.288 --> 35:39.770
Doctors, lawyers, artists,
politicians, you name it.

35:39.813 --> 35:42.468
Now, these women were featured
prominently in the news

35:42.512 --> 35:44.339
in the weeks preceding
their suicides.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.300
Are you saying all these women
were murdered
by our two suspects?

35:48.343 --> 35:49.780
Probably not all of them.

35:49.823 --> 35:51.738
-Okay, which ones then?
-How the fuck should I know?

35:51.782 --> 35:54.132
I mean, there's no crime scene,
there's no evidence, nothing.

35:54.175 --> 35:55.829
These guys are pros.

35:57.004 --> 35:58.658
That's your theory?

35:58.702 --> 36:02.009
Two men are simulatingwomen suicides on a large scale.

36:02.053 --> 36:03.837
Prominent women.

36:03.881 --> 36:05.752
If your theory's correct,
how come no one's ever noticed?

36:05.796 --> 36:07.406
Kelly, I noticed...

36:07.450 --> 36:10.148
and nobody believed me,
but I understand that.

36:10.191 --> 36:11.802
There's no apparent motives.

36:11.845 --> 36:14.805
There's no clues. These are not
even identified as murders.

36:14.848 --> 36:18.373
And there are over
a thousand suicides a year
in this fucking town.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.899
So these are perfect crimes?

36:21.942 --> 36:23.291
As close as they get.

36:25.076 --> 36:26.207
What's their motive?

36:26.251 --> 36:28.471
I don't know yet.
But they hate women,

36:29.907 --> 36:31.125
that's for sure.

36:34.041 --> 36:35.608
Look, I need a team, Kelly.

36:35.652 --> 36:38.350
There's way too much informationto process, I need help.

36:38.393 --> 36:40.526
Jeff, I can't do
that sort of thing anymore.

36:40.570 --> 36:44.312
It's not just you and me
in a car in stakeout mode.

36:44.356 --> 36:45.749
Okay. Right.

37:24.657 --> 37:26.224
I hate you.

37:31.011 --> 37:33.100
I hate you.

37:39.759 --> 37:42.240
I hate you!

39:36.136 --> 39:37.442
I came as soon as I could.

39:37.485 --> 39:38.661
Thanks. Come in.

39:50.977 --> 39:52.109
My God, Jeff.

39:52.892 --> 39:53.893
What have you been doing?

39:53.937 --> 39:56.069
I tried to think like they do,

39:56.113 --> 39:57.984
and now I know
how they operate.

40:26.143 --> 40:28.101
And then they're gone.

40:28.145 --> 40:29.233
Just like that.

40:30.756 --> 40:32.453
Okay.

40:32.497 --> 40:35.021
Let's just say
your theory is accurate.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.109
Mmm-hmm.

40:36.153 --> 40:37.545
What do we do about it?

40:37.589 --> 40:39.373
Okay, look, I made a list

40:39.417 --> 40:41.593
of the women that
I would kill next
if I was them.

40:43.116 --> 40:45.249
-How'd you do all this?
-I told you. Look at this shit!

40:45.292 --> 40:47.033
-Are you kidding me?
-Jeff.

40:47.077 --> 40:48.382
For two weeks,
I've been doing this.

40:48.426 --> 40:49.819
Jeff, you are scaring me.

40:49.862 --> 40:51.472
Look, it's fine. It's okay.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.823
But these women need to be put
into protective custody today.

40:53.866 --> 40:55.346
Okay, well, you're asking
for the impossible.

40:55.389 --> 40:57.565
-Fuck you!
-Do you know how much
this would cost?

40:57.609 --> 40:59.480
-Who cares how much it costs?
-Putting a dozen women under

40:59.524 --> 41:01.352
-constant police surveillance.
-Yeah?

41:01.395 --> 41:03.963
-And for how long?
-Until they attack, Kelly!

41:04.007 --> 41:06.096
Jeff, that could be
a couple of months.

41:06.139 --> 41:08.185
-Yeah.
-If you're right.

41:08.228 --> 41:09.752
No, I'm fucking right.

41:09.795 --> 41:11.275
Look, believe me.

41:11.318 --> 41:13.190
I would love nothing
than to protect these women,

41:13.233 --> 41:14.408
but this?

41:14.452 --> 41:17.063
This represents
thousands of man hours.

41:17.107 --> 41:20.153
So many other cases would never
be solved because of this!

41:20.197 --> 41:22.068
Hey, this is your part
of the fucking job!

41:22.112 --> 41:24.941
-I didn't ask...
-"Captain." No,
you fucking stole it from me!

41:24.984 --> 41:26.333
That's what happened.

41:26.377 --> 41:28.422
-Let's be real for a second.
-Okay, Jeff.

41:29.902 --> 41:32.209
What am I supposed
to tell the Commissioner?

41:32.252 --> 41:35.821
That my former partner,
who's barely showed up
at the precinct

41:35.865 --> 41:37.692
since his wife committed suicide

41:37.736 --> 41:40.260
-six months ago...
- Yeah.

41:40.304 --> 41:42.480
...has developed a theory
about two men

41:42.523 --> 41:44.961
who are suiciding famous women?

41:45.004 --> 41:46.658
That's not exactly
how I would put it, no.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.487
-We need proof.
-Mmm-hmm.

41:49.530 --> 41:50.836
-Jeff.
-Mmm-hmm.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.795
Concrete evidence...

41:52.838 --> 41:55.101
that at least some of this
is true.

41:55.145 --> 41:57.800
These men
don't leave evidence, Kelly!

41:57.843 --> 41:59.192
What do you think
I'm fucking telling you?

41:59.236 --> 42:00.846
You're smarter than this.

42:00.890 --> 42:03.109
They're fucking perfect at this!

42:03.153 --> 42:04.502
Figure it out!

42:48.024 --> 42:50.026
GRANDMA:
Don't let 'em catch you.
Come on.

42:51.984 --> 42:54.900
Get that boy! Get that boy
right there.

42:55.466 --> 42:56.684
Come on, you...

43:05.737 --> 43:06.999
Look what the cat dragged in.

43:08.044 --> 43:09.262
He looks happy.

43:13.179 --> 43:15.965
Well, today is a good day.

43:16.008 --> 43:17.749
You know what I've been saying
for months about Liz?

43:17.792 --> 43:18.924
What, that she didn't
kill herself?

43:18.968 --> 43:20.186
I don't wanna talk about it.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.709
-Mom, Mom, Mom.
-No!

43:22.885 --> 43:23.929
I was right.

43:25.322 --> 43:26.845
And I can prove it now.

43:29.587 --> 43:31.589
Are you serious?

43:31.632 --> 43:35.898
Two men have been
killing women...
for years.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.684
They killed Liz.

43:42.121 --> 43:43.557
Oh, my God.

43:47.431 --> 43:48.911
Are you sure?

43:52.697 --> 43:54.220
How close are you
to catching them?

43:54.264 --> 43:57.049
Mom, I'm so fucking close.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.878
If you really think
that you can catch
these sons of bitches,

43:59.922 --> 44:03.316
you do whatever
you have got
to do to catch them.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.450
If that means that you can't
spend time with Frankie...

44:08.060 --> 44:10.193
I will explain it to him,

44:10.236 --> 44:12.760
and we're gonna wait for you.

44:12.804 --> 44:16.242
This is a defining moment
in your life.

44:16.286 --> 44:18.331
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

44:18.375 --> 44:20.029
Thank you, Mom.

44:21.334 --> 44:23.380
She loved you so much.

44:23.423 --> 44:24.990
Dad!

44:25.034 --> 44:28.080
Hey! Come here, buddy.
Give me a hug.

44:28.124 --> 44:31.083
What're you doing here? Are we
going to Disneyland today?

44:32.302 --> 44:34.130
No, buddy. Not today.

44:34.173 --> 44:35.958
Did you catch
the bad guys already?

44:37.133 --> 44:39.570
No... but I will.

44:39.613 --> 44:42.007
I know, you're Batman.

44:44.270 --> 44:45.619
Go play with your friends, okay?

44:45.663 --> 44:46.664
Okay.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.101
I love you, buddy. Go ahead.

46:33.510 --> 46:35.120
Yeah?

46:35.164 --> 46:37.644
We just received a call
from a woman
named Amanda Tyler.

46:37.688 --> 46:39.690
She claims a man's been
stalking her,

46:39.733 --> 46:41.605
watching her from his car
for days now.

46:41.648 --> 46:43.085
What the fuck does
that have to do with me?

46:43.128 --> 46:44.912
Amanda Tyler is on the list
you gave me.

46:44.956 --> 46:47.045
So what, do you work
in Dispatch now, Captain?

46:47.089 --> 46:48.829
I asked to be informed
of anything

46:48.873 --> 46:50.483
that comes up about the women
on your list.

46:50.527 --> 46:52.616
So you did tell
the Commissioner about this?

46:52.659 --> 46:54.139
Why would I do that?

46:54.183 --> 46:55.619
This is just
between you and me.

46:56.924 --> 46:58.187
You're there right now,
aren't you?

46:58.230 --> 47:00.014
Of course I am.

47:00.058 --> 47:01.929
Are you staking out
all these women?

47:01.973 --> 47:04.323
Well, the best I can
with a one-man army.

47:04.367 --> 47:06.020
Imagine if someone found out

47:06.064 --> 47:07.718
you were doing
illegal police surveillance?

47:07.761 --> 47:10.677
Look, I'm doing this mostly
on my free time, okay?

47:10.721 --> 47:13.854
Yeah, tell that to the jury.
You gotta leave her be, Jeff.

47:13.898 --> 47:15.334
At least for the time being.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.119
Yes, ma'am.

47:19.904 --> 47:21.210
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:24.474 --> 47:26.302
Okay.

47:47.758 --> 47:49.890
Pick up the phone,
pick up the phone.

48:01.902 --> 48:03.208
Jeff, it's no use.

48:03.252 --> 48:05.732
Kelly, listen to me.
Send backup here.

48:05.776 --> 48:07.386
-Right away.
-What are you talking about?

48:07.430 --> 48:08.518
They're here.

48:08.561 --> 48:10.476
-Now?
-Yes, right now. Do it.

48:46.208 --> 48:49.036
Hey! Don't fucking move!

48:54.825 --> 48:56.218
Listen.

49:01.048 --> 49:05.314
Put your hands
behind your head. You too.

49:06.445 --> 49:07.707
Do it!

49:07.751 --> 49:08.969
Who's Elizabeth?

49:10.319 --> 49:11.363
JEFF: Drop the gun.

49:12.538 --> 49:14.758
-I said, drop your gun.
-Do as he says.

49:16.194 --> 49:17.891
You can still save her.

49:21.373 --> 49:22.592
Now.

49:29.425 --> 49:31.078
Turn around.

49:31.122 --> 49:32.558
-On your fucking knees.
-Ow.

49:35.387 --> 49:36.736
You didn't answer my question.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.261
Who's Elizabeth?

49:39.826 --> 49:41.088
My wife.

49:41.132 --> 49:44.091
Detective Jeff Anderson.
LAPD Homicide.

49:45.136 --> 49:46.746
Like Elizabeth Anderson.

49:46.790 --> 49:48.270
Yeah, the painter.

49:48.313 --> 49:50.097
You were so nervous
about that one

49:50.141 --> 49:52.056
-because her husband was a cop.
-Mmm.

49:52.099 --> 49:53.623
Rightfully so.

49:53.666 --> 49:55.102
I remember.

49:55.146 --> 49:57.061
There was a young boy, too.

50:00.412 --> 50:01.848
So we killed your wife.

50:04.198 --> 50:05.765
How'd you know we'd be here?

50:07.158 --> 50:08.986
I tried to think like you.

50:09.029 --> 50:12.859
Well, you're just a
regular Magnum PI,
aren't you, Detective Anderson?

50:12.903 --> 50:14.426
All right, I'm sick
of this shit.

50:14.470 --> 50:15.645
Wait!

50:25.176 --> 50:26.308
They're here!

50:40.670 --> 50:41.888
You need help.

50:43.281 --> 50:44.717
Okay, okay.

50:44.761 --> 50:46.502
You're gonna be okay.

50:48.895 --> 50:50.070
This is the way out of here.

50:53.117 --> 50:54.205
It's all right.

50:57.817 --> 50:59.253
Stop right there!

51:04.520 --> 51:07.784
Don't go back to the house.We go with the contingency plan,take off.

52:05.624 --> 52:08.148
JEFF: Mark Witver , freelance building contractor,

52:08.192 --> 52:10.455
who was married
to Felicia Connor, deceased.

52:11.891 --> 52:13.719
She committed suicide.

52:13.763 --> 52:15.329
Same bathroom setup
as the victims.

52:16.243 --> 52:17.897
And the young one is their son?

52:17.941 --> 52:20.552
KELLY: Adam Witver. He was five when his mother killed herself.

52:21.510 --> 52:22.641
JEFF: Five.

52:39.266 --> 52:41.791
OFFICER: House is clear,
Captain, but you gotta take
a look at the basement.

52:50.364 --> 52:51.757
OFFICER: Watch your step.

54:17.016 --> 54:19.584
KELLY: Jeff... I'm so sorry.

54:20.890 --> 54:22.021
We shouldn't have doubted you.

54:24.415 --> 54:25.503
It's okay.

54:26.852 --> 54:27.984
Your hands were tied.

55:16.293 --> 55:17.947
We need to find your son.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.213
You need to find my son.

55:23.256 --> 55:24.431
Count me out of it.

55:26.564 --> 55:28.305
Family's everything.
Right, Jeff?

55:28.348 --> 55:30.002
Yeah.

55:30.046 --> 55:33.397
So what is it with you?
Why don't you tell me
your story?

55:33.440 --> 55:34.616
I want to hear it.

55:37.967 --> 55:39.969
Well...

55:40.012 --> 55:43.015
Roll out the old family tree,
my father...

55:44.364 --> 55:45.888
Well...

55:45.931 --> 55:47.890
He was long gone
by the time I was born.

55:47.933 --> 55:49.369
My mother raised me alone.

55:49.413 --> 55:50.719
I was a difficult little shit.

55:52.851 --> 55:55.680
I think I resented her
for my father not being around.

55:55.724 --> 55:57.595
But, any case,

55:57.639 --> 56:01.338
raising me alone turned out
to be way too fucking much
for her to handle.

56:03.035 --> 56:04.863
She killed herself...

56:04.907 --> 56:06.038
when I was nine.

56:08.084 --> 56:11.217
Found her in the bath,
drowning in her own blood.

56:11.261 --> 56:14.090
And right next to her,
there was an empty bottle
of sleeping pills.

56:14.133 --> 56:17.876
And I remember reading a notice
again and again...

56:17.920 --> 56:20.662
trying to find an explanation
for what happened to her.

56:23.229 --> 56:27.538
One of my mother's friends
reached out to Child Services

56:27.581 --> 56:29.932
and offered to take care of me.

56:29.975 --> 56:35.720
It turns out,
she thought that I had
driven my mom... crazy.

56:35.764 --> 56:37.940
Crazy enough
to take her own life.

56:40.725 --> 56:44.381
So, she decided that she had to
put me back on the right track,

56:44.424 --> 56:45.774
which included...

56:47.210 --> 56:49.995
beatings and unjust punishments.

56:52.258 --> 56:53.912
Humiliations.

56:53.956 --> 56:55.871
I took things
into my own hands.

56:55.914 --> 56:57.524
MALE OFFICER: Captain?

56:57.568 --> 57:01.790
One morning,
I called the police,
I was 12 or something.

57:01.833 --> 57:03.574
And I told them...

57:04.749 --> 57:06.490
"I found her dead
in the bathtub."

57:10.755 --> 57:13.062
Never felt better
in my whole life.

57:16.152 --> 57:18.502
Why are you telling me all this?

57:18.545 --> 57:20.896
You think that justifies
what you did to these women?

57:22.332 --> 57:23.376
Huh?

57:24.377 --> 57:25.727
To my wife?

57:27.641 --> 57:29.643
I'm telling you this because...

57:29.687 --> 57:32.995
I respect you for being
smart enough to get me here.

57:33.038 --> 57:35.824
I want you
to understand who I am.

57:36.825 --> 57:37.826
And two...

57:40.089 --> 57:41.438
By tomorrow,
I'll be out of here.

57:41.481 --> 57:43.005
-And you'll never
hear from me again.

57:44.136 --> 57:46.443
Wow, is that a fact?

57:46.486 --> 57:50.447
You don't think
we do what we do
without a contingency plan,

57:50.490 --> 57:51.491
do you, Detective Anderson?

57:57.367 --> 57:59.282
Jeff, you need to come with me.

57:59.804 --> 58:01.153
Now.

58:01.197 --> 58:02.328
Here we go.

58:05.027 --> 58:06.158
What?

58:11.598 --> 58:13.383
Jeff...

58:13.426 --> 58:14.601
What are you doing here?

59:16.446 --> 59:17.882
Where are we going?

59:17.926 --> 59:20.145
I told you. Your dad
wanted me to pick you up.

59:20.189 --> 59:21.277
I'm his new partner.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.366
So we're going to see Dad?

59:23.409 --> 59:25.107
-Absolutely.
-Cool.

59:26.238 --> 59:28.458
Why didn't Grandma come with us?

59:28.501 --> 59:31.417
She had to run some errands.
Don't worry.

59:31.461 --> 59:33.767
Meantime, we can have some fun
just the two of us, right?

59:33.811 --> 59:34.812
Come on.

59:37.032 --> 59:38.381
Left.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.039
21.

59:57.748 --> 59:59.750
-We don't have a choice.
-You know how this works.

59:59.793 --> 01:00:01.230
Hey, they have Frankie!

01:00:01.273 --> 01:00:03.536
You're asking me to release
a fucking serial killer!

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.060
-Listen to yourself!
-What is wrong with you?

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.410
We will play him.
Plant a tracker.

01:00:07.453 --> 01:00:09.151
And what if
he gets rid of the bug?

01:00:09.194 --> 01:00:12.241
What if they kill
Frankie anyway?

01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:16.288
Let's just go in there
and get something out of Mark.

01:00:16.332 --> 01:00:19.117
'Cause he will be
over the fucking moon
to help us.

01:00:20.771 --> 01:00:22.773
Where the fuck are they?

01:00:22.816 --> 01:00:25.167
Uh-oh. What has Adam done now?

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.908
-He took my son.
-Frankie?

01:00:26.951 --> 01:00:28.518
Wow, they grow up so fast!

01:00:31.434 --> 01:00:32.870
Stay over there.

01:00:32.914 --> 01:00:35.090
Good. I'm good.

01:00:35.742 --> 01:00:37.179
Mr. Witver.

01:00:38.049 --> 01:00:39.485
Mr. Witver!

01:00:41.487 --> 01:00:43.837
I'm Captain Alderman, and I'm
the officer in charge here.

01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:45.709
What, female police captain?

01:00:45.752 --> 01:00:47.667
Wow.

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:50.888
You don't see that every day.

01:00:50.932 --> 01:00:53.499
Wait a minute.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:57.590
Now, if I remember correctly,
when we got interested

01:00:57.634 --> 01:01:02.204
in your wife, you were studying
for the whole captain thing.

01:01:03.248 --> 01:01:04.510
So that means...

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:07.949
She took your job?

01:01:09.472 --> 01:01:11.082
You better make sure your balls
are still attached.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:15.391
Look, if you cooperate with us,
and help us find his son,

01:01:15.434 --> 01:01:17.349
we'll convince the DA
to take it into account.

01:01:17.393 --> 01:01:21.005
And they'll knock a couple
of hundred years
off my prison term?

01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:24.182
Please, bad Captain.
Let me give you
the lay of the land.

01:01:25.227 --> 01:01:26.750
We'll give him back his son

01:01:26.793 --> 01:01:29.840
in exchange for my immediate
release from this shithole.

01:01:29.883 --> 01:01:31.581
You know perfectly well
that's not gonna happen.

01:01:31.624 --> 01:01:33.975
Well, then you're gonna have to
buy a small wooden box.

01:01:34.018 --> 01:01:35.411
Motherfucker...
You're gonna die.

01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:36.760
-Jeff!
-You know that?

01:01:36.803 --> 01:01:37.891
Jeff...

01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:40.416
All right, Jeff,
what are you gonna do?

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:43.549
You gonna shoot me right here?
That'll be perfect.

01:01:43.593 --> 01:01:45.290
That'll end well for you.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:48.032
Think for one fucking second.
I die, he dies.

01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:49.251
You understand me?

01:01:49.294 --> 01:01:50.730
Jeff...

01:01:51.688 --> 01:01:52.863
Put it down.

01:01:53.951 --> 01:01:56.345
What's gonna happen.

01:01:56.388 --> 01:01:59.826
You're gonna get out of here,
and I'm gonna get my son.

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.959
Back off, Madam Captain,
back off!

01:02:08.009 --> 01:02:10.881
You two are gonna
walk me right out of here.

01:02:10.924 --> 01:02:12.274
You understand?

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:14.363
Let's go.

01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:15.973
I'm sorry.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.675
Go ahead, Jeff.

01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:26.462
Move.

01:02:57.275 --> 01:02:58.711
Car keys, Jeff.

01:02:58.755 --> 01:02:59.930
The car's at the crime scene.

01:02:59.973 --> 01:03:01.062
Madam Captain?

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.286
You know, I feel for you, Jeff.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.854
I took your wife,
this woman took your job.

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:12.812
You got nothing left.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:15.076
The least I could do is
give you back your job.

01:03:17.774 --> 01:03:19.384
- I'm gonna...
-Think about your son!

01:03:21.952 --> 01:03:23.301
-Back off.
-Yeah?

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.868
Fuck you.

01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:57.553
When is my dad coming?

01:03:57.596 --> 01:04:00.599
Soon. He just texted me
to say he's running late.

01:04:00.643 --> 01:04:02.340
He's always late.

01:04:04.429 --> 01:04:06.736
Kind of sucks that your dad is
never there for you, huh?

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.303
I don't know.

01:04:09.173 --> 01:04:11.044
My mom was like that.

01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:12.524
I always hated her for it.

01:04:15.136 --> 01:04:16.398
My mom died.

01:04:18.443 --> 01:04:21.054
Yeah, mine too.

01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:22.839
Kind of seems like
we got a lot in common.

01:04:25.015 --> 01:04:27.452
I think we're gonna be
buddies, you and I.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:30.542
A lot.

01:04:32.544 --> 01:04:33.850
I never had many friends.

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:52.956
Your wife didn't
kill herself, did she?

01:04:52.999 --> 01:04:57.221
When I met Felicia,
I was just doing odd jobs
for a living.

01:04:57.265 --> 01:05:00.050
She, on the other hand,
was finishing law school.

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:04.924
Love at first sight.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:08.319
Didn't think it through
very much.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.626
We married six months
after we met.

01:05:12.497 --> 01:05:15.152
She then got a job
at some fancy law firm,

01:05:15.196 --> 01:05:17.676
and started to change
from day fucking one.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.200
I thought she was
gonna leave me.

01:05:20.288 --> 01:05:21.854
But she got pregnant.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.292
That's right.

01:05:25.336 --> 01:05:27.295
After Adam was born,

01:05:27.338 --> 01:05:31.560
we thought that it would
put some cement into
the cracks of our marriage,

01:05:31.603 --> 01:05:32.996
but instead, it just...

01:05:34.258 --> 01:05:38.131
started some sort of
unhealthy competition

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:41.700
between her career
and our family.

01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:44.355
So you killed her.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.097
I enjoyed every second of it.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:51.057
And that was the start
of a very long series.

01:05:53.364 --> 01:05:54.931
I like to think my mother was.

01:06:02.721 --> 01:06:04.288
MARK: Stop.

01:06:10.163 --> 01:06:11.904
This is where
you get out, buddy.

01:06:12.992 --> 01:06:14.820
Just tell me where my son is.

01:06:14.864 --> 01:06:15.952
How would I know?

01:06:17.562 --> 01:06:19.303
I wanna see him, now.

01:06:19.347 --> 01:06:23.394
Calm down. I'll release him
as soon as I find Adam.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.353
-You have my word.
-That wasn't the fucking deal.

01:06:25.396 --> 01:06:27.137
That was exactly
the fucking deal.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.878
You release me,
I release Frankie.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.184
Call Adam. Do it, now.

01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:34.710
Jeff, you're not putting this
together, see?

01:06:34.753 --> 01:06:36.233
I'm the one calling
the shots here.

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:42.108
Are you kidding me?

01:06:42.152 --> 01:06:44.285
Did you really think
I was gonna let you go?

01:06:48.376 --> 01:06:50.247
Get Adam on the phone.
Do it.

01:06:51.204 --> 01:06:52.205
Now!

01:07:00.605 --> 01:07:03.042
-Dad.
-Adam. It's me.

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:06.872
I'm being, uh, detained...
by our old friend,
Detective Anderson.

01:07:08.221 --> 01:07:10.398
But you stick to the plan.
You keep that boy...

01:07:11.399 --> 01:07:12.661
Adam. Hey.

01:07:13.618 --> 01:07:14.619
Fuck!

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.275
Okay.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.451
Your rules.

01:07:21.191 --> 01:07:22.540
What's going on?

01:07:24.803 --> 01:07:28.372
Your dad called.
Unfortunately,
he can't make it.

01:07:28.416 --> 01:07:30.505
Why did you call him "Dad"?

01:07:32.202 --> 01:07:33.682
Just a little joke...

01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:36.075
that we have
between each other.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.340
-Can I talk to him?
-No, he's busy.

01:07:39.383 --> 01:07:40.645
You know how he gets.

01:07:41.733 --> 01:07:44.127
Can we go back
to Grandma's house?

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.259
-I don't like this place.
-Fuck it, Frankie,

01:07:46.303 --> 01:07:49.350
your grandma asked me to
take care of you
until tomorrow, okay?

01:07:49.393 --> 01:07:50.612
She called you?

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:54.572
Why don't...

01:07:55.747 --> 01:07:58.054
you swallow this?

01:08:00.056 --> 01:08:03.102
Makes you get
a good night's sleep.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:06.758
And then when you wake up
tomorrow, I'll take you
to your father. I promise.

01:08:06.802 --> 01:08:10.414
Grandma told me
never to accept
anything from strangers.

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:13.330
I'm not a stranger.
I'm your dad's partner,
remember?

01:08:13.374 --> 01:08:14.984
Then show me your police badge.

01:08:15.027 --> 01:08:16.506
I don't have it
with me right now.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.987
And I don't believe you.

01:08:20.772 --> 01:08:22.426
This is my gun.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.819
Do you believe me now?

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:34.220
Good boy.

01:09:31.147 --> 01:09:33.453
What now?

01:09:33.497 --> 01:09:35.107
I'm gonna text you an address,
you're gonna come right away
and you're gonna bring my son.

01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:36.892
You know what, you're
getting ahead of yourself.

01:09:40.765 --> 01:09:42.027
You're a cop.

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:49.078
You killed my wife,
and my partner.
You took my son.

01:09:49.121 --> 01:09:52.647
Do you think
I give a fuck, a single fuck,
about being a cop?

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.518
Dad, Dad, what do you
want me to do here?

01:09:54.562 --> 01:09:56.346
No matter how many times
you hit me,

01:09:56.389 --> 01:09:58.087
you're never gonna get us to do

01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:59.958
anything we don't wanna do.

01:10:01.482 --> 01:10:02.700
Really?

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:05.964
Okay. You asked for it.

01:10:06.008 --> 01:10:07.009
No!

01:10:07.575 --> 01:10:09.272
Dad! Dad!

01:10:09.315 --> 01:10:11.143
I'm gonna text you an address,

01:10:11.187 --> 01:10:13.755
and you're gonna be here
in an hour.

01:10:13.798 --> 01:10:17.715
Jesus fucking Christ!
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:10:22.894 --> 01:10:23.895
That looks like
it kinda hurts.

01:10:53.011 --> 01:10:56.014
Doesn't it strike you
that you and I are a lot alike?

01:10:58.364 --> 01:11:00.584
I think you're losing
blood to the brain.

01:11:00.628 --> 01:11:02.760
I killed your wife,
tore your life apart,

01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:05.589
you became obsessed and started
living by that obsession.

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:06.982
I made you, Jeff.

01:11:09.288 --> 01:11:13.554
Just like the women
in my life made me.

01:11:13.597 --> 01:11:15.817
You're not gonna make it
out of here alive.
I want you to know that.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.602
Let's see what Adam
has to say about that.

01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:20.386
Aren't you ashamed
of what you made him?

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:23.389
I'm very proud of him.

01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:25.261
Never forget,
he grew up without a mother.

01:11:48.066 --> 01:11:49.502
Where's Frankie?

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:50.591
You okay, Dad?

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:53.419
I'll live.

01:11:53.463 --> 01:11:55.552
I wanna see my son, now.

01:11:55.596 --> 01:11:57.641
You release my father,
and I release Frankie,

01:11:57.685 --> 01:11:58.860
it's as simple as that.

01:11:58.903 --> 01:11:59.991
Now!

01:12:01.602 --> 01:12:04.953
By the way, we became
good friends, Frankie and I.

01:12:04.996 --> 01:12:07.129
We got a lot in common.

01:12:07.172 --> 01:12:08.304
Don't you think I know
what you're doing?

01:12:08.347 --> 01:12:09.914
I don't buy your
bullshit mind games.

01:12:11.829 --> 01:12:13.309
Get out of here, Adam.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:17.400
Let me tell you
what happens next.

01:12:17.443 --> 01:12:20.969
We part ways,
Adam keeps Frankie...

01:12:21.012 --> 01:12:24.320
you bring me before a jury
and you let
my lawyer go through

01:12:24.363 --> 01:12:26.539
all the irregularities
of my arrest.

01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.847
I take my chances
with the judge,
and you lose your job.

01:12:29.891 --> 01:12:35.679
In the meantime, Frankie
gets to spend some quality time
with Uncle Adam.

01:12:35.723 --> 01:12:37.376
He'll make
an excellent apprentice.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.162
He has the best
possible background.

01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:44.732
No! Stop!

01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:48.431
I'm gonna keep counting,
and each time I reach three,
he loses another limb!

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.128
One!

01:12:50.781 --> 01:12:52.000
Two!

01:12:53.479 --> 01:12:55.307
Three!

01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:57.179
Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

01:13:01.574 --> 01:13:03.402
You just killed your own son.

01:13:16.154 --> 01:13:17.982
Dad! No!

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.071
Dad! You motherfucker,
he was everything to me!

01:13:20.115 --> 01:13:22.204
Tell me! Where's Frankie?

01:13:24.597 --> 01:13:27.600
So you got nothing left
to exchange, and I got
nothing to fucking lose!

01:13:29.124 --> 01:13:30.734
I guess that makes us dead men.

01:13:30.778 --> 01:13:33.432
Daddy! Please help me!

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.440
FRANKIE: Help me!

01:14:08.467 --> 01:14:09.947
Help me!

01:14:37.235 --> 01:14:41.587
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:15:15.317 --> 01:15:16.405
Why?

01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:19.887
Why did you help him
kill all those women?

01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:23.891
My father raised me that way.

01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:28.939
So go ahead, do it.

01:15:30.245 --> 01:15:31.333
Do it!

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:42.692
Daddy?

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.651
ADAM: Do it!

01:15:45.695 --> 01:15:49.830
-What are...
What are you doing?
-Frankie! Frankie, come here!

01:15:51.396 --> 01:15:53.007
Okay. All right.

01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:54.269
It's over. It's over.

01:15:54.747 --> 01:15:56.793
Okay? Okay.

01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:00.188
It's okay, buddy.

01:16:00.231 --> 01:16:02.016
I'm gonna put you
in the car, okay?

01:16:02.059 --> 01:16:04.192
I just need you to
go in the car.

01:16:04.235 --> 01:16:07.630
All right? And put
your seatbelt on for me. Okay?

01:16:07.673 --> 01:16:09.893
Yeah, good boy.
Good boy.

01:16:09.937 --> 01:16:11.764
Just put that on.
All right?

01:16:20.948 --> 01:16:22.253
I'll be right back.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:24.995
Get up. Get up!

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:28.869
Move. Move!

01:16:36.441 --> 01:16:38.530
Your father was everything
to you.

01:16:38.574 --> 01:16:40.489
Let's see how you manage
without him.

01:17:01.205 --> 01:17:03.207
Why are you throwing it away?

01:17:05.427 --> 01:17:07.298
I'm done with it, buddy,
I don't need it anymore.

01:17:12.738 --> 01:17:13.914
Hey, Frankie,
where are you going?

01:17:30.626 --> 01:17:33.368
You catch bad guys, Dad.
That's your job.

01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:35.022
People need you.

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:46.903
Close the door.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.645
Put your seatbelt on.

01:17:55.912 --> 01:17:56.957
You ready?

01:17:58.175 --> 01:17:59.481
Let's go.

01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:18.065
What, are you just
gonna leave me here?

01:18:50.923 --> 01:18:52.273
I love you.
