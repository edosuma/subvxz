<i>El Gato!</i>

00:31.844 --> 00:34.188
<b>2x09- "Sphere"</b>

00:38.511 --> 00:40.179
I have but one calling:

00:40.638 --> 00:43.016
to protect the people of San Lorenzo.

00:44.558 --> 00:46.393
I have but one task:

00:47.436 --> 00:49.438
to find the last missing item

00:49.522 --> 00:51.482
and return it to the treasure house.

00:51.565 --> 00:54.151
And I have...
- But one squire, me!

00:54.234 --> 00:56.111
Ulschalk Sundenbock!

00:56.195 --> 00:59.323
Und your squire has
but two little goaty legs.

00:59.406 --> 01:01.617
Ack!
No. I have broken the pattern.

01:01.701 --> 01:03.828
Uli, what do I keep telling you?

01:03.911 --> 01:06.039
I do not require a squire.

01:09.042 --> 01:11.210
"Require a squire." This is fun to say.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.796
But every hero needs a squire, Herr Boots.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.923
And you are a great hero!

01:16.007 --> 01:17.466
Of course I am. Why?

01:17.550 --> 01:18.926
Is someone saying that I am not?

01:19.010 --> 01:20.011
Bring them to me,

01:20.094 --> 01:23.222
and I will slice them up lengthwise,
like so! Ha-ha!

01:23.305 --> 01:24.139
En garde!

01:24.223 --> 01:28.019
Whoo! Just like how you sliced up
the Swamp Serpent of Salzberg, ja?

01:28.102 --> 01:28.978
Ha-ha!

01:29.062 --> 01:31.605
Anyway, you were saying
you had but one task?

01:31.689 --> 01:32.648
No, no, Uli.

01:32.732 --> 01:35.902
A serpent you must slice crosswise.
Observe.

01:37.444 --> 01:40.823
Now a troll you must first subdue
before you do the slicing.

01:40.907 --> 01:42.491
This technique is more advanced.

01:42.575 --> 01:44.702
And since you insist, I will show you.

01:45.912 --> 01:49.456
The slicing must be done like so, and so.
You see? It is important...

01:49.540 --> 01:51.542
I did once have the assistance
of a small monkey

01:51.625 --> 01:54.503
while battling sea monsters
in the East Indies.

01:54.587 --> 01:55.713
This is a most amusing...

01:55.796 --> 01:58.758
Have I ever told you
of how I wooed the Marquesa de Montemayor

01:58.841 --> 02:00.760
using only some goat cheese
and a tambourine?

02:00.843 --> 02:01.761
And then I said,

02:01.844 --> 02:05.014
"When Puss in Boots says
he is going to slice up a medusa,

02:05.098 --> 02:08.559
this medusa will get sliced up
by Puss in Boots!"

02:09.102 --> 02:11.145
Wait, why are you all here?

02:11.228 --> 02:13.272
Hm? Oh! Ooh!

02:13.355 --> 02:15.900
It's five o'clock.
You said you'd have the final item by now,

02:15.983 --> 02:18.277
and we're all supposed to come watch
the spell get restored.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.238
Oh, yes. Hmm.

02:21.321 --> 02:24.033
Well, do not worry. It will be a snap!

02:25.492 --> 02:28.537
<i>The treasure house inventory list
says the last remaining item</i>

02:28.621 --> 02:32.041
is some kind of silver sphere.
And it is around here somewhere.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.667
But Puss...
- Observe.

02:33.751 --> 02:36.879
The rod is pointing down
into the orphans' garden.

02:36.963 --> 02:40.382
We just have to dig into the ground
to recover this silver sphere.

02:40.466 --> 02:42.259
Once again, but Puss...

02:42.342 --> 02:44.804
And there is nothing down there
but a realm of mole people,

02:44.887 --> 02:49.725
ruled by a king who spends all day
gazing at his prized possession, a...

02:50.267 --> 02:51.685
<i>Silver sphere.</i>

02:51.769 --> 02:55.148
Tat-tat-tat. Don't tell me. It is a, um...

02:55.230 --> 02:57.232
Ha! A silver sphere!

02:58.275 --> 02:59.110
Oh.

02:59.193 --> 03:02.071
The silver sphere is obviously
the Mole King's bally.

03:02.155 --> 03:04.782
You remember what happened last time
it got taken from him.

03:04.865 --> 03:06.408
I... saved the day?

03:06.492 --> 03:08.744
He and his guards came up
and wrecked the town!

03:08.828 --> 03:10.454
And then I saved the day.

03:12.498 --> 03:13.707
Wait, the only reason

03:13.791 --> 03:16.376
the Mole King loves his bally
is that it's shiny.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.504
What if we got
an even bigger, shinier sphere

03:18.587 --> 03:19.546
and offered to trade?

03:19.630 --> 03:20.965
Where would we get such a thing?

03:21.048 --> 03:24.593
I mean, does anyone in town
know how to make a silver sphere?

03:24.718 --> 03:26.470
Behold!

03:26.553 --> 03:29.140
It's an experimental fishbowl I designed.

03:29.223 --> 03:32.267
A perfect globe
so the goldfish can't jump out.

03:32.351 --> 03:35.771
Ooh! And it's shiny
to protect its privacy.

03:35.855 --> 03:37.523
But how would you see the goldfish?

03:37.940 --> 03:40.151
Well, exactly. Not my best invention.

03:40.234 --> 03:42.736
And how would you feed it?
- Not my best invention.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.530
And how would you even
get the fish inside?

03:45.198 --> 03:48.951
Not... my best... invention.

03:50.119 --> 03:50.995
<i>It is decided!</i>

03:51.120 --> 03:54.498
With this silver sphere in trade,
I will dig down below the earth...

03:54.581 --> 03:57.459
...und travel to the kingdom
of the people who are moles,

03:57.584 --> 04:00.546
accompanied as always
by his faithful squire.

04:00.629 --> 04:05.092
No! Uli, I have told you...
- Und as your squire...

04:05.176 --> 04:08.991
hop, I will of course do
all of the diggings mein self.

04:10.223 --> 04:11.473
You have convinced me.

04:12.766 --> 04:13.851
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

04:13.934 --> 04:14.977
<i>♪ I'm a little goaty man ♪</i>

04:15.061 --> 04:16.394

04:21.399 --> 04:23.819
You are an odd fellow, Uli.

04:28.741 --> 04:31.577
<i>Okay, Puss!
Watch out! Be safe!</i>

04:31.660 --> 04:33.495
You know what happened
the last time the Mole King...

04:33.579 --> 04:36.749
Yes, yes, Artephius, I know.
Thank you for reminding me.

04:57.186 --> 04:59.688
Eh, Your Most Esteemed Highness,

04:59.772 --> 05:02.649
I, Puss in Boots, have traveled from...

05:02.733 --> 05:04.443
Quiet! Quiet!

05:04.526 --> 05:07.487
Can't you see
I'm being really sad about stuff?

05:08.530 --> 05:10.283
This was her favorite comb.

05:10.824 --> 05:12.534
She used it for combing!

05:12.618 --> 05:15.121
Who did?
- The Queen of the Megamicres.

05:15.204 --> 05:17.748
The Make-a-mookies?
- The Megamicres!

05:17.831 --> 05:20.500
They live below us.
It's science. Read a book.

05:21.668 --> 05:25.047
Anyway, the queen's my girlfriend,
except she dumped me.

05:25.131 --> 05:27.424
I don't even know what I did wrong!

05:27.507 --> 05:30.427
And this sad show isn't helping me
feel better at all.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.931
Look at that sad king,
sitting there all sad.

05:34.014 --> 05:35.849
It's making me even sadder!

05:39.853 --> 05:43.149
So, what are you here to tell me?
It better not be something sad.

05:43.232 --> 05:44.900
Benevolent Mole King,

05:44.984 --> 05:47.694
I come to you with a business proposition.

05:47.778 --> 05:50.239
Wait, you're that cat.

05:50.572 --> 05:53.326
I'm not a fan of yours,
in case you forgot.

05:54.994 --> 05:57.371
You're that other cat.
You're good, I like you.

05:59.832 --> 06:02.209
I dunno what this guy's doing,
but I'm into it.

06:02.293 --> 06:04.503
Look at his little hoofy foots.
That's so neat.

06:04.586 --> 06:07.422
You honor me with your observation.

06:07.756 --> 06:10.843
Great Mole King, I propose a trade.

06:10.926 --> 06:13.179
In exchange for your bally, we will...

06:13.262 --> 06:17.933
Bally? No! My bally!
You're always trying to take my bally!

06:18.017 --> 06:21.520
In exchange for
your bally, we offer you

06:21.603 --> 06:23.981
this bigger and shinier bally!

06:24.064 --> 06:25.816
Huh? Hm.

06:25.899 --> 06:27.526
Bigger, shinier bally?

06:27.609 --> 06:31.697
Um, does it have the same show?
- Give it a try.

06:33.949 --> 06:36.660
Hm, yeah, looks like that other guy.

06:36.743 --> 06:39.372
Whoa! But the picture's
way better on this one.

06:39.454 --> 06:40.706
It's like wide screen.

06:41.290 --> 06:44.168
But... now he's making me sad again.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.753
I don't even care
about the show right now.

06:46.879 --> 06:48.881
I can't eat, I can't sleep,

06:48.964 --> 06:51.091
and I definitely can't think
about bally trades.

06:51.217 --> 06:54.220
I can't do anything
until I'm back with her.

06:54.303 --> 06:58.432
Good king, if Dulcinea and I
can get the queen to take you back,

06:58.515 --> 07:00.100
will you make the bally trade?

07:00.184 --> 07:02.519
Oh, man, are you serious? Anything!

07:03.270 --> 07:05.480
But how?
- It's really quite simple.

07:05.564 --> 07:08.608
There's just one rule
that you always need to remember.

07:08.692 --> 07:11.362
And that rule is to always focus on...

07:11.445 --> 07:13.113
yourself.
- The other person.

07:13.655 --> 07:14.823
Yourself.
- The other person.

07:14.907 --> 07:15.782
<i>Wait, what?</i>

07:15.866 --> 07:17.492
You must focus on yourself.

07:17.576 --> 07:20.371
You know, the primping, and
the grooming, and the strutting.

07:20.495 --> 07:23.665
Making yourself irresistible to the
ladies is what romance is all about.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.710
No, Puss. You focus on the other person.

07:26.793 --> 07:29.046
Their needs, their desires.

07:29.129 --> 07:32.507
You express your true emotions to them.
That's romance.

07:32.674 --> 07:35.386
I think I know
how to romance a lady, all right?

07:35.469 --> 07:38.638
Have I ever told you of how I wooed
the Marquesa de Montemayor

07:38.722 --> 07:40.807
using only some goat cheese
and a tambourine?

07:40.891 --> 07:42.935
<i>Ooh! Tell us the tale of this.</i>

07:43.018 --> 07:45.438
Hey, none of this is about me!

07:45.520 --> 07:49.608
You two officially have until
sleep time to fix my relationship!

07:49.775 --> 07:51.444
Otherwise the deal's off!

07:51.526 --> 07:54.447
Don't you worry, Your Majesty.
You can count on us.

07:54.529 --> 07:56.782
We will reunite you with the queen.

07:57.116 --> 07:59.368
This I swear!

08:04.331 --> 08:06.125
We will divide and conquer.

08:06.208 --> 08:09.169
The king likes you better than me,
so you stay here and try to teach him

08:09.253 --> 08:10.587
how to be a better boyfriend.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.881
Got it. And you go down to the Megamicres

08:12.965 --> 08:15.509
and convince the queen
to give the king another chance.

08:15.592 --> 08:17.470
Ooh! Und I will flit back and forth

08:17.552 --> 08:20.722
and let you both know
the progress of the other. Whoo!

08:20.806 --> 08:24.226
Just think of all the flittings
I will be doing.

This I like! Very fancy!

09:06.393 --> 09:09.646
And I have always liked fancy places.

09:13.859 --> 09:16.987
Ohh. Hola, seòoritas.

09:17.070 --> 09:18.738
<i>Trespasser!</i>

09:33.712 --> 09:36.840
Mmm!

09:42.846 --> 09:44.056
Nighty-night.

09:46.058 --> 09:48.685
I demand to see your queen.

09:50.563 --> 09:53.232
Perhaps "demand" is too strong a word.

09:59.863 --> 10:02.115
Your Highness, we've captured an intruder.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.086
Throw her in the pit of the fleshworms!

10:16.755 --> 10:18.549
Ay! Yikes!

10:18.673 --> 10:20.634
First off, that is nasty.

10:20.717 --> 10:22.386
And second, I'm not a her.

10:24.179 --> 10:25.264
I am a him!

10:26.306 --> 10:28.141
You're a him?

10:28.225 --> 10:32.854
Oh! I'm sorry. The only males
I've ever seen are mole men,

10:32.938 --> 10:37.443
and you're so... so pretty!

10:38.026 --> 10:40.028
Um, well, sure.

10:40.112 --> 10:41.738
Some say handsome.

10:41.821 --> 10:43.449
Others say rugged or chiseled.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.742
One said "symmetrical", as I recall.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.369
She and I did not work out.

10:47.453 --> 10:50.163
Mm, go on.

10:53.542 --> 10:56.836
Let's start from the beginning.
Do you know why the queen left you?

10:57.003 --> 10:59.798
She said a bunch of stuff,
but I can't remember what

10:59.881 --> 11:02.468
'cause there was
a really good episode of my show on

11:02.551 --> 11:04.803
where the guy just kept nodding
and saying "uh-huh."

11:04.886 --> 11:07.431
I couldn't look away,
it was so good, but...

11:07.514 --> 11:10.976
Oh! She did say she wanted
a grand romantic jester.

11:11.059 --> 11:12.811
So I got her one. See?

11:14.647 --> 11:18.817
I wonder if she might've actually said
a "grand romantic gesture."

11:19.818 --> 11:22.779
Huh. Maybe. Is that something
you can help me with?

11:22.862 --> 11:24.072
Oh, you betcha.

11:24.156 --> 11:25.991
How about we start
by doing a little role-playing?

11:26.074 --> 11:28.368
Okay! I'm awesome at mole-playing.

11:28.452 --> 11:31.497
Role-play...
Oh, y'know, sure, that's fine.

11:32.498 --> 11:35.292
Let's role-play a romantic stroll.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.002
Pretend that I'm the queen.

11:37.085 --> 11:38.962
Okay. I guess I'd just start walking.

11:39.045 --> 11:42.382
And I'd walk next to you, like so.
- No, you stay here, Queen.

11:42.466 --> 11:46.512
I don't want you distracting me.
I take my strolls pretty seriously.

11:49.848 --> 11:52.976
Dancing is very romantic.
We'll start by learning how to waltz.

11:53.059 --> 11:55.770
Oh, no need.
There's a traditional mole dance

11:55.854 --> 11:57.606
that me and the queen do all the time.

11:57.690 --> 11:59.149
She loves it. Watch.

11:59.774 --> 12:00.775
Music!

12:04.237 --> 12:06.490
Oh! Ooh! Um...

12:06.615 --> 12:09.284
Okay. Uh, so what do I do?

12:09.368 --> 12:11.911
For the first hour,
you sit there and watch.

12:11.995 --> 12:15.123
Then, I don't know what you do after that,
because I black out.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.587
A candlelit dinner.
The ultimate romantic gesture.

12:20.671 --> 12:21.630
Waiter!

12:22.422 --> 12:23.965
I'll have the maggot loaf.

12:24.049 --> 12:25.467
That'll be all. Go.

12:26.051 --> 12:28.928
Aren't you forgetting something?

12:29.012 --> 12:33.600
Huh? Oh, snap, yeah. Of course.
For dessert, I'll have the dirt fudge.

12:33.684 --> 12:36.061
Your king has spoken!

12:38.313 --> 12:39.314
What?

12:39.898 --> 12:43.818
Oh! Um, should I, like,
order you some food too?

12:44.403 --> 12:46.572
That would be lovely.
See? Now you're getting it.

12:46.655 --> 12:48.365
Ah, man, how about that?

12:48.448 --> 12:50.534
Maybe love isn't so hard after all.

12:50.617 --> 12:51.577
Hey, waiter!

12:51.660 --> 12:56.873
The lady will have the maggot loaf
and the dirt fudge as well.

12:58.751 --> 13:02.254
As for the fur on my belly,
I just use a mild balm.

13:02.337 --> 13:04.590
You want it to be glossy,
but not too glossy.

13:04.673 --> 13:07.467
Even the words you're saying sound pretty.

13:07.551 --> 13:09.928
Tell me more about yourself.

13:10.011 --> 13:11.471
Oh. Yes.

13:11.555 --> 13:14.558
I suppose I have been talking
mostly about myself.

13:14.641 --> 13:17.477
You see, Your Majesty,
what I came down here to say...

13:17.561 --> 13:19.772
Your Highness!
We've captured another intruder.

13:19.854 --> 13:23.066
Whoo! It's not often I get to have
the upsides down.

13:23.149 --> 13:25.193
What a special treat this is for Uli.

13:25.277 --> 13:27.654
Your Majesty, this is my friend.

13:27.738 --> 13:29.615
Squire!

13:29.698 --> 13:33.452
All the bloods have rushed
to mein little goaty he-e-a-ad.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.203
So, Herr Puss? How do things go?

13:35.287 --> 13:37.706
I will make my report to Dulcinea.

13:38.373 --> 13:42.085
Yes, yes, well, I have not really begun
all that just yet.

13:42.168 --> 13:43.462
You have not told her?

13:43.545 --> 13:47.841
So you have just been wasting the time?
Very good. I will go report this.

13:48.467 --> 13:52.929
He thinks he's my squire,
but I do not require a squire.

13:53.012 --> 13:56.809
Ah, that gets me every time.
- So, you were saying?

13:56.891 --> 14:00.228
Some reason why you came down here?

14:00.312 --> 14:03.398
I suppose it is not fair to suggest
that I require no one, though.

14:03.857 --> 14:06.067
I did once have the assistance
of a small monkey

14:06.151 --> 14:09.321
while battling sea monsters
in the East Indies.

14:18.831 --> 14:19.790
What?

14:20.332 --> 14:23.168
This is, uh... maggot loaf?

14:23.251 --> 14:24.878
Oh, yeah.

14:24.961 --> 14:26.921
It's maggots smushed into a loaf.

14:27.005 --> 14:28.965
But don't worry,
you can still really taste

14:29.048 --> 14:30.717
each and every maggot.

14:30.801 --> 14:33.846
Oh! And be sure to save some room
for that dirt fudge.

14:35.555 --> 14:38.851
That's not just, uh, dirt smushed
into fudge, is it?

14:39.852 --> 14:44.939
"Dirt smushed into fudge"!
That's like...

14:45.357 --> 14:47.484
Oh, man! No! No!

14:47.567 --> 14:51.864
It's dirt that's mixed with water
and smushed into fudge.

14:51.946 --> 14:55.241
Oh, you're so hilarious!

14:55.325 --> 14:58.578
The queen never made me
laugh like this.

15:05.001 --> 15:06.211
Oh, my gosh.

15:09.297 --> 15:10.757
Oh, my gosh.

15:11.508 --> 15:13.176
Do you know what I just realized?

15:14.887 --> 15:16.971
I'm totally in love with you.

15:17.723 --> 15:20.559
What?
- Yeah, I totally am.

15:21.601 --> 15:24.229
Oh, my gosh. You should be my queen!

15:24.312 --> 15:25.522
What a great idea!

15:25.605 --> 15:27.273
People, listen up!

15:27.357 --> 15:29.108
This is your new queen now.

15:29.192 --> 15:31.862
She's the love of my life
since like five seconds ago

15:31.945 --> 15:34.322
and she's gonna live here
and help me boss you guys around

15:34.406 --> 15:35.782
forever and ever!
- Oh!

15:35.866 --> 15:37.868
<i>All hail the queen!</i>

15:37.951 --> 15:40.245
Whoo! This is a fun surprise.

15:40.954 --> 15:43.206
Wait, he has fallen in love with her?

15:43.289 --> 15:45.500
Oh, ja. He asked her to be his queen.

15:45.584 --> 15:47.085
Right in the middle
of the most charming dinner,

15:47.168 --> 15:50.839
mit the table cloths und the candles
und the loves in the air!

15:50.923 --> 15:53.383
This is not going according to plan.

15:53.466 --> 15:56.094
The Megamicre Queen
has fallen in love with me too.

15:57.888 --> 16:00.390
Whoo! A blessing on your households.

16:00.724 --> 16:04.686
Uli, go to Dulcinea at once
and tell her we must both try harder.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.354
We are running out of time.

16:06.438 --> 16:08.899
I will say this thing. Off I clomp.

16:11.025 --> 16:13.194
Your Majesty, as I was saying,

16:13.278 --> 16:15.113
I have come down here because...

16:15.280 --> 16:17.156
Oh, what is the matter?

16:18.575 --> 16:20.744
I... I'm a little sad,

16:20.827 --> 16:22.704
if you want to know the truth.

16:24.873 --> 16:27.459
See, I just broke up with someone and...

16:27.542 --> 16:30.253
I could tell you were sad,
because your ears are drooped over.

16:30.336 --> 16:34.299
Look! Oh, my.
They are really very droopy, are they not?

16:34.382 --> 16:36.593
Kind of uh... tempting.

16:36.676 --> 16:38.136
Hey! Pretty boy!

16:38.219 --> 16:39.972
My eyes are down here.

16:40.806 --> 16:42.599
Right! Yes. Sorry.

16:42.682 --> 16:46.394
As though I would bat at the ear
of a great ruler such as yourself.

16:48.772 --> 16:51.232
As I was saying...

16:51.524 --> 16:53.151
I'm sad because...

16:53.234 --> 16:55.320
Just... Sorry, really quickly.

16:55.403 --> 16:58.031
Would it be okay
if I were to bat at her ear?

16:58.156 --> 17:02.243
Argh! Why? Why can't you focus
on what I'm trying to say to you?

17:02.327 --> 17:04.997
I can! I just...
- You don't care about me!

17:05.079 --> 17:07.205
Guards, seize him!

17:11.127 --> 17:12.086
Ha-ha!

17:21.095 --> 17:22.513
Ha-ha!

17:43.743 --> 17:47.413
Your Majesty,
you have my full, undivided attention.

17:48.999 --> 17:52.836
Thanks for updating me, Uli.
Puss is right. We need to try harder.

17:52.919 --> 17:55.421
Ja, it's almost time for the sleepings.

17:55.588 --> 17:58.466
Also, let us be very careful
not to say anything

17:58.550 --> 18:01.386
about the queen falling in love
with Herr Boots.

18:01.469 --> 18:03.847
Oh! The queen loves the cat?

18:03.930 --> 18:05.139
Schweinhund!

18:05.223 --> 18:07.475
I have made the oopsie-doopsie!

18:07.559 --> 18:10.228
Your Highness!
What were you doing back there?

18:10.311 --> 18:13.940
I was gonna surprise you
with an extra plate of dirt fudge.

18:14.024 --> 18:18.152
I thought it would be grand and romantic.
I even got the jester, see?

18:20.697 --> 18:21.907
I can't believe it.

18:21.990 --> 18:25.785
That sneaky cat stole my girlfriend!
I knew I couldn't trust him!

18:25.869 --> 18:29.622
Your Highness, it's not his fault.
- You're right. It's hers.

18:29.706 --> 18:31.541
How could she do this to me?

18:31.624 --> 18:35.628
Oh, my heart feels like
it got smushed into a loaf.

18:35.921 --> 18:40.008
I hate her!
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her!

18:40.092 --> 18:43.845
Everyone, listen up! We're going to war!

18:44.846 --> 18:46.723
We're gonna storm down there,

18:46.806 --> 18:50.143
and we're gonna go through 'em
like dirt fudge through a maggot!

18:50.226 --> 18:54.439
'Cause the queen's in love with that cat,
and I hate him, and I hate her,

18:54.522 --> 18:56.524
and I hate everything right now!

18:56.608 --> 18:59.736
All right, let's move it out!

19:01.320 --> 19:04.240
Wait up, though, 'cause I want to be
up front. Wait, hang on.

19:04.365 --> 19:06.576
Excuse me. Comin' through.

19:06.659 --> 19:07.535
Oh, my.

19:08.120 --> 19:12.498
<i>I wanted to like you,
Puss, okay? Really, I did.</i>

19:12.582 --> 19:16.669
You're suave, you're charming,
you're very pretty.

19:16.753 --> 19:19.172
Some say handsome.
- But you're the worst!

19:19.255 --> 19:22.216
Are all men this self-involved?

19:22.300 --> 19:24.886
You're just like my ex
with his stupid bally.

19:24.970 --> 19:27.388
Your Majesty, the Mole King has changed.

19:27.472 --> 19:29.557
He does not care about his bally anymore!

19:29.641 --> 19:31.810
Oh, you're lying.
- No, it is true.

19:31.893 --> 19:36.272
He has agreed to give it to me in exchange
for a poorly-designed fishbowl.

19:36.355 --> 19:38.691
Okay, now I know you're lying.

19:38.775 --> 19:42.528
We're done here. Guards, throw him
in the pit of the fleshworms.

19:42.612 --> 19:45.073
So, just for the sake of clarity,

19:45.157 --> 19:46.992
these fleshworms, are they...?

19:47.075 --> 19:50.495
Giant worms that eat your flesh?
Yes, they are.

19:50.578 --> 19:53.247
What the heck?

20:07.804 --> 20:09.139
Whoa!

20:16.229 --> 20:18.397
Move it! One side!

20:18.481 --> 20:20.066
Hello, Queenie.

20:20.150 --> 20:23.319
Moley! What are you doing here?

20:23.402 --> 20:26.990
I hereby declare war on you!
- Your Highness! Don't do this!

20:27.073 --> 20:30.618
Guards! On my command,
start doing war stuff!

20:30.702 --> 20:33.246
Wait! Why are you doing this?

20:33.329 --> 20:36.332
I don't know. Mmm...
because you love the cat, okay?

20:36.415 --> 20:38.835
It's not fair, 'cause I love you!

20:38.918 --> 20:41.587
And you broke up with me,
and I don't know why you did,

20:41.671 --> 20:43.923
so what else am I supposed to do,
you know?

20:44.924 --> 20:47.219
Oh, Moley!

20:48.469 --> 20:51.180
<i>Oh!</i>

20:54.308 --> 20:58.146
I can't believe you went to the trouble
of declaring war on me.

20:58.230 --> 21:01.107
What a grand romantic gesture.

21:01.691 --> 21:02.942
Ooh!

21:04.194 --> 21:06.196
I never knew you cared this much.

21:06.279 --> 21:09.574
If you'd only shown me before,
I never would've left you!

21:09.657 --> 21:11.076
Wait, really?

21:11.159 --> 21:13.661
Well, I'll always declare war on you then.

21:13.745 --> 21:14.913
I swear it!

21:16.664 --> 21:19.500
Poopsie.
- Poopsie.

21:21.711 --> 21:24.040
<i>Ohh.</i>

21:24.380 --> 21:25.339
<i>Aw.</i>

21:28.509 --> 21:30.386
This is so sweet.

21:34.307 --> 21:35.391
Yee!

21:38.853 --> 21:42.774
Just imagine how happy everyone will be
when they find out that we got the sphere.

21:42.857 --> 21:44.776
I told you it would be a snap.

21:44.859 --> 21:47.445
All it took was showing
the Mole King that, in love,

21:47.528 --> 21:50.573
it is important to think
of the other person first.

21:51.324 --> 21:54.535
Why did no one suggest this earlier?

21:54.619 --> 21:59.373
And Uli, you were most helpful today,
keeping me from getting too distracted.

21:59.457 --> 22:00.917
Very helpful indeed.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.669
Um, do you get what I'm telling you?

22:03.753 --> 22:06.005
That... I was very helpful today?

22:06.089 --> 22:09.217
That perhaps I do require a squire.

22:09.301 --> 22:10.760
You mean it, Herr Boots? Truly?

22:10.761 --> 22:14.322
Oh! I am so full of the joy.
I will do such good work for you.

22:14.323 --> 22:17.350
I will not let anyone
do the distractings.

22:17.433 --> 22:21.020
You! Dulcinea!
You are distracting Herr Boots.

22:21.104 --> 22:24.065
Get away from him
with that pretty face of yours!

22:24.482 --> 22:27.401
Ah, but Uli, Puss is
the pretty one, remember?

22:28.111 --> 22:30.613
Handsome. We say handsome.
