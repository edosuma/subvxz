00:39.120 --> 00:40.800
'The religious life

00:40.800 --> 00:43.200
'was not one I could have chosen.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.600
'To nurse is to be drawn into society,

00:46.600 --> 00:50.400
'to interweave one's life with the business of strangers.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.960
'It's about the world and flesh and what some people call the devil.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.160
'To balance that with the setting apart of the heart

01:00.160 --> 01:03.400
'and the quiet, closed existence of the spirit

01:03.400 --> 01:06.160
'would have been beyond me altogether.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.600
'But others saw the joy in that

01:09.600 --> 01:11.880
'and sought to live it out,

01:11.880 --> 01:16.720
'sustained and inspired by those who'd heard the call before them.'

01:33.840 --> 01:36.520
Good morning, Sister.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.040
Did you sleep well?

01:38.040 --> 01:42.360
How am I to wake refreshed when these potions of mould,

01:42.360 --> 01:47.960
and other poisons, pervade my brain and contaminate my dreams?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.560
It's the fever that's causing your nightmares, Sister.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.360
The antibiotics are fighting the infection that's shown up

01:53.360 --> 01:54.880
in your urine.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.840
I tire of this organ mightily.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.600
It is no better than a pig's bladder,

02:01.600 --> 02:04.400
blown up and used as a football.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.840
Come, let's take your temperature

02:06.840 --> 02:09.680
and think about a glass of barley water.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.920
Sister Winifred and Nurse Franklin to take the district round.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.960
And, Nurse Gilbert and Sister Mary Cynthia,

02:17.960 --> 02:21.240
I don't want any shilly-shallying on home visits today.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.720
You've a dozen apiece to get through, and clinic this afternoon.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.280
What time's Sister Evangelina arriving?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.480
Sister Evangelina's schedule is immaterial.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.280
She is to be assigned light duties only.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.240
Good grief, Master Turner. You're shooting up like forced rhubarb!

02:38.240 --> 02:40.560
Sometimes, I'm in agony in the night.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.360
Growing pains are actually a documented phenomenon.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.680
Are they indeed?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.560
My mum sent me to the chemist to fetch the insulin.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.160
Enough to sink a battleship again.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.560
I spend half my district round time with the diabetics,

02:53.560 --> 02:55.080
and it's getting worse!

02:55.080 --> 02:57.640
Mollycoddled, the lot of them.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.000
Pass me the Rolodex, I'm taking this in hand.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.080
SHE SIGHS

03:07.120 --> 03:10.600
GENERAL HUBBUB

03:18.360 --> 03:20.120
Haven't been in there for ages.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.560
How long have the pair of you been twiddling your thumbs?

03:22.560 --> 03:23.800
Oh, I don't know.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.320
I've been putting new tyres on Sister Evangelina's bike.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.120
And I was...checking they were safe.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.960
It's a shame you weren't checking on my hubcaps - they're gone.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.560
- All four of them!
- Really?

03:35.560 --> 03:37.160
Really!

03:37.160 --> 03:40.560
I'll warrant they're down at that gypsy camp on the bomb site,

03:40.560 --> 03:42.760
along with half the lead in Poplar!

03:42.760 --> 03:44.400
See you later, Fred.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.560
Never had you before.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.320
Mrs Roland? I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.000
We expected a nurse on the dot of half past.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.360
I'm here to see your daughter, I believe -

04:05.360 --> 04:09.960
Paulette Roland, Miss, Aged 17, diabetes.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.280
We've had a shocking morning.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.680
Look at her, she's white as a sheet.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.120
I'm sure Paulette can provide me with the details,

04:18.120 --> 04:20.000
while I test her urine.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.960
It's on the sideboard. We always put it there.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.280
We usually get one of the young nurses.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.640
Oh, they make a point of it -

04:26.640 --> 04:30.280
Paulette is the second youngest diabetic on their books.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.760
She was sick last night, her levels are going to be all over the place.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.200
Let's see what the test says, shall we?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
A very reassuring shade of blue.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.600
Which means no sugar in the urine.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.960
I always get very nervy when the nurse comes late.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.720
If I don't get my insulin on time,

04:46.720 --> 04:48.560
it can take all day to get me sorted out.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.840
Well, we have a plan to make sure your insulin is never late again -

04:52.840 --> 04:55.880
I'm going to teach you how to inject yourself.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.040
I don't want to!

04:57.040 --> 05:00.240
We've always had the nurse come and do it, ever since she was diagnosed.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.200
- We're entitled!
- Paulette is entitled to the best of care, Mrs Roland.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.720
And in the case of insulin injections,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.840
the best of care means doing it herself.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.760
Now, young lady, are you decent under that froufrou housecoat?

05:22.240 --> 05:25.760
Remember, calm, courteous, concentrate on getting facts.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.640
Facts? We'll be lucky.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.960
And don't jump to conclusions.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.240
Lousy tinkers.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.480
- Morning, sir.
- I was thinking it was more like afternoon.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.440
- Oh, yeah - it's five past.
- I'll be stopping for me dinner soon.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.080
What've you come looking for?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.920
We just...wanted a bit of a chat.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.720
We're busy. So leg it.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.920
Sarge...

05:51.920 --> 05:53.680
We're sorry to disturb you, sir,

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
but we're on the lookout for some stolen car parts -

05:56.240 --> 05:59.120
hubcaps, emblems - the sort of things kids might nick.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.640
Not my kids.

06:00.640 --> 06:04.400
- It's the school holiday - they can run a bit wild.
- Mine don't.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.000
They don't go to school, so they'd have no holidays to run wild in.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.840
They're workers.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.720
- Ask this one.
- BABY CRIES

06:12.720 --> 06:15.680
Breda!

06:15.680 --> 06:17.560
Me grandson.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.880
Congratulations. How old is he?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.400
- Three days.
- Is he your first?

06:22.400 --> 06:25.360
Yes. I called him John.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.880
Can't resist a newborn, me.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.080
I've got a nipper meself, nearly 18 months old now.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.760
If you've finished your work here, can we get on with ours?

06:34.760 --> 06:38.280
Of course. Keep an eye on the kids, though.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.600
We do.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.600
Hello, Pats!

06:52.600 --> 06:55.000
- What do you think?
- All your own work?

06:56.520 --> 06:58.120
You are a dark horse.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.840
I got Sister Winifred to do it in the end.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.040
She's quite the Picasso with the poster paints.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.320
Have you got one for me to put up at the nurses' home?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.960
I've even supplied the drawing pins!

07:05.960 --> 07:08.080
They're in the envelope with the tickets.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.080
I shall peddle them relentlessly.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.400
We've got to get those cubs to the jamboree.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.600
Norfolk's such a long way!

07:14.600 --> 07:17.160
The train fare alone will be beyond most families,

07:17.160 --> 07:18.680
and then there'll be other costs.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.200
No child should be excluded because they lack the means.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.040
You really care about those little scamps, don't you?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.440
Yes.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.040
(But don't tell anyone.)

07:27.040 --> 07:28.640
Your secret's safe with me.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.720
There's a baby in a pram out there with a pierced ear turning septic!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.640
I want her brought in and shown to Doctor.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.400
Will these mothers never learn?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.560
Welcome back, Sister Evangelina.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.240
Sister Evangelina! Greetings!

07:46.240 --> 07:48.800
We should have guessed you'd come straight here!

07:48.800 --> 07:51.000
It's clinic day, why wouldn't I?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.280
Toy Box Corner was left unsupervised for one minute

07:53.280 --> 07:55.200
and Susan pushed a piece of Lego up her nose.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.480
I can't get it out!

07:56.480 --> 07:59.600
Lego? Used to be dried peas and Meccano screws.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.120
Still, least they're moving with the times!

08:02.120 --> 08:05.120
I recommend a cold compress and digital pressure.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.800
Thank you. I'll try Vaseline and tweezers.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.400
She nearly didn't go out to her friend's -

08:34.400 --> 08:36.240
she thought I was looking peaky.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.240
You don't look peaky to me...

08:38.240 --> 08:40.080
..you look beautiful.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.320
You smell beautiful 'n' all.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.720
What's that?

08:45.720 --> 08:50.120
Tabu by Dana. The "forbidden fragrance."

08:50.120 --> 08:52.880
So forbidden, I had to send off for it mail order.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.120
What did your probation officer say this morning?

08:55.120 --> 08:57.840
Oh, you know, the usual -

08:57.840 --> 09:00.280
"Keep it up, young fellow, wish they were all like you."

09:00.280 --> 09:02.640
He's getting a job interview lined up for me -

09:02.640 --> 09:04.760
apprentice print worker, up Fleet Street.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.280
Almost worth going to borstal for.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.600
That's all done with. I promise you.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.520
Come on, we've got an hour before she's back.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.200
Bless us, O Lord,

09:18.200 --> 09:22.040
and these thy gifts which we receive by thy bounty.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.920
May we be always grateful and ever mindful of those in need.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.560
Amen. ALL: Amen.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.800
What's this?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.960
It's a cheese tart. Nurse Crane suggested it.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.360
You've had major surgery, below the waist,

09:38.360 --> 09:41.360
you don't want to tax your digestion with animal matter.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.520
Cheese IS animal matter.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.800
And this is a quiche. You know my feelings.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.360
Shall I open a tin of salmon?

09:49.360 --> 09:51.520
By all means.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.360
So, Sergeant Noakes,

09:53.360 --> 09:57.160
are there any developments in the case of Nurse Crane's hubcaps?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.520
Not as yet. We made enquiries at that campsite,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.600
but no-one was very forthcoming.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.400
I detect a hint of resignation in your tone.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.160
Well, they close ranks, don't they?

10:06.160 --> 10:08.280
I did see a lovely little baby, though.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.640
Three days old, his mother looked about 14.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.160
One of those gymslip mums, I reckon.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.760
Perhaps you should make contact.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.640
If the girl is as young as Sergeant Noakes says,

10:17.640 --> 10:19.680
she may need our help.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.280
I wouldn't advise sending anyone alone.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.040
METAL CLATTERS

10:25.040 --> 10:28.560
CHILDREN CHEER AND LAUGH

10:28.560 --> 10:31.520
Lenny! Lenny! What do you think you're playing at?

10:31.520 --> 10:33.560
- Where did you get them from?
- Found 'em.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.800
Found 'em attached to someone's car, more like. Dad'll kill you.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.320
No, he won't, he will just laugh.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.560
Yeah, but you listen to me,

10:40.560 --> 10:42.560
Dad's got a funny sense of humour,

10:42.560 --> 10:45.360
and robbing things isn't a joke, Len!

10:45.360 --> 10:46.640
Now give 'em here.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.080
Give 'em.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.640
- CHILDREN LAUGH
- Race you back!

10:55.280 --> 10:58.360
As street leaders in the Civil Defence Corps,

10:58.360 --> 11:02.760
it is your responsibility to commit the layout of the district to memory.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.680
In the event of nuclear warfare,

11:06.680 --> 11:10.920
many of the local landmarks will be reduced to dust.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.240
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr Buckle.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.160
And on my first day, as well!

11:15.160 --> 11:18.320
I had to wait in for a delivery at my shop - name tapes.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.400
Oh, the grammar school mothers would have my guts for garters

11:21.400 --> 11:23.880
if they weren't in the shop tomorrow morning.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.560
Well, we can't have that, can we?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.880
Will we be walking far this evening?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.200
Well, you appear to be wearing stout footwear,

11:30.200 --> 11:31.440
I'm sure it will suffice.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.960
I've walked all over Selsey Bill in these.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.200
They've got a cushioned insole.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.680
Erm, Mr Cowan,

11:37.680 --> 11:41.400
if you would give Mrs Gee an Ordnance Survey map,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
that would be appreciated.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.800
Is it all right if I hold it upside down?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.240
Only I find it easier that way.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.040
If it assists you, that's all that matters.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.040
"Efficiency" is our watchword.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.320
- Ah...
- You need stronger laces for those boots.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.160
Possibly nylon, with a metal aglet.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.040
I'll have to take Angela to the surgery with me today.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.320
Mrs Penny has picked precisely the wrong week to go on holiday.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.720
Your father will have to take you for your haircut

12:15.720 --> 12:19.000
- whilst he has his lunch break.
- He never has a lunch break.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.960
I do now. Your mother insists on it.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.840
Hello, nurse!

12:23.840 --> 12:28.320
We've half a dozen ulcer patients coming in for dressing changes.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.360
Oh, Patrick, you've cut yourself shaving again.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.840
- It's that new safety razor.
- BELL RINGS

12:33.840 --> 12:37.120
That had better be Mrs Gee about the name tapes.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.920
Dad, I want to wear long trousers, not shorts.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.280
Mum's bought me shorts and I don't want to wear them.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.040
And what does your mother say?

12:44.040 --> 12:46.520
That she likes to see young boys in shorts and, anyway,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.160
she's already bought them.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.280
But Nurse Crane says I have legs like rhubarb,

12:50.280 --> 12:52.800
- and she's an old woman.
- Tim...

12:52.800 --> 12:55.440
Imagine what they'll say at grammar school.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.520
Well, other people will be wearing shorts.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.520
Other people have different legs!

13:03.680 --> 13:06.280
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

13:15.360 --> 13:17.920
Nobody enters a caravan without being invited.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.920
We're entirely happy to stand outside and talk.

13:20.920 --> 13:24.800
We're looking for a young lady who had a baby very recently.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.440
That'd be my niece, Breda.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.520
Is Breda's baby in that rather smart pram?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.120
No, he's inside,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.320
out of the wet, where you'd expect him to be.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.400
We don't want to pry,

13:37.400 --> 13:41.600
but we weren't aware of medical help being sent for when Baby arrived,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.040
and we just wanted to make sure both Breda and the little one

13:45.040 --> 13:47.120
were comfortable and well.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.760
We didn't send for any help because none was needed,

13:49.760 --> 13:51.320
any more than it's needed now.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.200
I deliver all the babies in this family,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.680
always have, like my grandmother before me.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.960
We were only concerned,

13:56.960 --> 14:00.480
because we'd heard that Breda was a tiny bit on the young side.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.640
She's 16.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.760
And married, in case you were wanting to ask questions about that.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.720
Aunt Attracta, I want to show him to them.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.800
Will you please come inside?

14:16.080 --> 14:17.680
Wipe your feet.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.040
What a perfectly immaculate umbilical stump.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.720
Yes, it's drying up very nicely.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.120
I like to use fuller's earth myself,

14:29.120 --> 14:31.360
but Breda made me put baby powder on it.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.920
It smells nicer.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.720
We could bring you some of our medicated cord powder,

14:37.720 --> 14:40.920
- if you'd like.
- It's the colour of him that bothers me.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.080
I keep telling her, it's a touch of the jaundice is all.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.640
Your aunt's quite right. It's nothing to worry about

14:46.640 --> 14:47.840
at this stage,

14:47.840 --> 14:50.760
just a sign that Baby's adjusting to being in the outside world.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.680
This yellow tinge should fade in a day or two.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.640
And we can look in again, just to reassure you.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.160
All right.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.600
I'm making tea, for my grandmother.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.960
She didn't eat her dinner, it's all she wants.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.200
Will you take a cup?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.280
Oh, thank you. That's very kind.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.200
I didn't expect glamour when I came into nursing.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.080
But I had hoped for something more than a night in,

15:18.080 --> 15:21.040
discussing square dancing and drinking Horlicks.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.200
- Actually, it's Bournvita.
- Hmm!

15:24.200 --> 15:27.880
- I might faint with excitement(!)
- So what are we going to wear?

15:27.880 --> 15:30.320
Checked shirts are quite popular, and I have plenty.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.960
I was hoping for a poodle skirt,

15:31.960 --> 15:34.760
like the one the Queen wore when she went to Canada.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.440
The trouble with poodle skirts

15:36.440 --> 15:39.280
is they can't be worn with a straight face any more.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.120
You need a dash of irony or you'll simply look naive.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.680
KNOCKING ON DOOR

15:48.120 --> 15:50.680
I believe the tickets are half a crown.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.960
- For the square dance.
- Oh, of course.

15:52.960 --> 15:57.120
My cousin and I decided to have an adventure the year before last.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.200
We indulged in a week in Butlins.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.320
- There was a square dance every night.
- Oh!

16:05.640 --> 16:07.240
Thank you.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.920
THEY LAUGH

16:28.520 --> 16:31.680
What's all this? Woman In A Dressing Gown again?

16:31.680 --> 16:35.240
I can't do a thing with her, Nurse. No breakfast again this morning.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.880
And whose fault is that?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.880
I go off my food when I'm upset and you keep upsetting me!

16:39.880 --> 16:42.200
You know my views on Vaughn Sellars.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.640
And you know your father's views.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.880
- SHE GAGS
- I'm going to be sick.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.320
I'll deal with this.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.680
SHE COUGHS

16:56.760 --> 16:58.960
I'm hardly bringing anything up.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.160
It's just all bile.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.360
Take a sip of water.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.680
SHE COUGHS

17:12.000 --> 17:13.800
Good morning, Mrs Turner.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.440
Have you got room for one more sample in that batch?

17:16.440 --> 17:17.800
Is it ready to go?

17:17.800 --> 17:20.440
I'm about to send them off and I have to leave on time today.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.119
It's all marked up.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.000
If my hunch proves correct, we've got our work cut out -

17:25.000 --> 17:27.920
pregnancy test for Paulette Roland, Miss.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.840
Good luck at the grammar school, Timothy.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.400
I suspect I'm going to need it.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.280
Make sure you work hard, eh?

17:36.280 --> 17:39.200
You heard the lady. And good on you for getting in!

17:42.240 --> 17:43.680
Used to be one of my cubs.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.920
Aw, it's lovely watching them all getting on in life, isn't it?

17:46.920 --> 17:48.160
Not 'arf.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.240
And what can I do for you, Mr Buckle?

17:51.240 --> 17:54.680
I take it you don't need name tapes or a badge for your blazer.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.840
No, I came for some of those shoelaces you mentioned.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.720
Of course. Nylon, with a metal aglet.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.560
That'll be one and four.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.920
Oh, look at these ribbons.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.520
My girls always had new hair ribbons

18:07.520 --> 18:08.720
for going back to school.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.240
I remember.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.280
Did I hear that Marlene went to live in Canada?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.000
She's back in Birmingham now,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.400
Dolly's in Australia

18:16.400 --> 18:18.440
and three nippers between them.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.600
Ah, well, your wife would be very proud.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.280
She was a lovely woman.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.560
Yes, she was.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.840
My Bert thought highly of her, too.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.560
I can still see his face the morning after that air raid.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.360
They had it tough, those ARP wardens.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.440
Mm.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.560
Well, someone had to do it

18:36.560 --> 18:39.840
and someone will have to do it again if they drop that bomb.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.320
Well, we're working on that, aren't we, eh?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.520
SHOP BELL JINGLES

18:50.640 --> 18:52.440
Lads, I'm watching you.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.920
They're not bad boys, just...

18:58.160 --> 18:59.320
..wilful.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.560
I've come to see Breda and baby John.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.280
I brought the cord powder we mentioned.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.160
She's taken him out in his pram, "Get a bit of sun on him", she said.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.840
Probably just wants to show him off.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.880
Yes.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.480
But she shouldn't try to do too much, too soon.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.000
Ah, sure, the young ones,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.200
they're over it in no time.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.920
It's older mothers who feel it a little more.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.240
Will you take a chair and wait for her?

19:20.240 --> 19:21.560
I'll make you some tea.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.920
My grandmother, Pegeen, she's going out with the tide.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.360
Doesn't want food any more.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.320
I give her tea in one of her good cups, make it feel special.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.840
It's a beautiful pattern.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.640
Crown Derby.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.280
It was part of her dowry when she married.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.040
Half the tea goes down her neck, the rim's that wide.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.640
Would you like a doctor to visit,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.920
to see if there's anything he can do?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.400
He might want her moved.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.720
She wouldn't want that.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.600
Morning, Sister.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.080
Oh, hello, Breda.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.280
You sit there and have a rest.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.560
I don't need tea.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.360
Oh, yes.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.000
Hello.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.400
- PHONE RINGS
- I'll get it.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.960
Allow me, I'm waiting for news on a number of cases.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.880
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.480
Evening, Dr Turner.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.000
He wants you.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.120
Speaking.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.600
Nurse Crane,

20:23.600 --> 20:27.240
why did you request a pregnancy test for Paulette Roland?

20:27.240 --> 20:29.480
Because there's a boyfriend on the scene,

20:29.480 --> 20:32.400
and I know the difference between diabetes-related nausea

20:32.400 --> 20:34.200
and morning sickness.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.920
Yes, you do.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.160
The results came back positive.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.720
- Oh, hell's teeth!
- 'Hell's teeth, indeed.'

20:42.720 --> 20:45.440
Diabetes and pregnancy are a very dangerous...

20:45.440 --> 20:46.800
'combination.'

20:50.040 --> 20:52.240
I can't be in the family way!

20:52.240 --> 20:53.440
I can't...

20:53.440 --> 20:54.880
I labelled the sample myself,

20:54.880 --> 20:57.000
and saw it packed up and sent off.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.440
You never told me you were sending it anywhere!

20:59.440 --> 21:02.120
I'm 17! I've a right to know what you're doing with my wee!

21:02.120 --> 21:04.360
Tell her she's made a mistake.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.920
Tell her it isn't possible...

21:08.520 --> 21:10.320
We were trying to be careful...

21:13.160 --> 21:14.520
..but we couldn't manage it.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.160
Stupid...

21:18.160 --> 21:19.400
..little...

21:19.400 --> 21:20.600
..slut!

21:22.200 --> 21:23.880
How am I going to tell your father?

21:23.880 --> 21:27.760
He's halfway to ruddy Rio de Janeiro on an oil tanker!

21:27.760 --> 21:29.600
- Mrs Roland...?
- And you needn't be thinking

21:29.600 --> 21:32.040
there'll be any sort of shotgun wedding.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.800
That Sellars lot are the biggest wrong 'uns in Poplar,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.840
and Vaughn's already been inside!

21:36.840 --> 21:38.640
It was only borstal.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.920
He's put all that behind him.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.720
Besides, I love him and he loves me.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.000
You don't know what love is, Paulette.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.280
Mrs Roland...?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.920
Love is wanting the best for someone, doing without,

21:47.920 --> 21:50.160
to make sure that they get the best!

21:50.160 --> 21:52.520
And don't be trying to tell me that Vaughn Sellars

21:52.520 --> 21:53.960
has done any of those things.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.720
Are you a smoker, Mrs Roland?

21:55.720 --> 21:58.680
You might find you'd benefit from a cigarette?

21:58.680 --> 22:01.000
- THROUGH GRITTED TEETH
- I'm clean out of them.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.720
Perhaps Dr Turner can supply the deficiency?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.280
He said he would wait in his car

22:05.280 --> 22:07.360
till I gave him the nod.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.960
What do you mean, "the nod"?

22:17.240 --> 22:18.720
Sweetheart,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.720
will you sup something off the spoon for me?

22:20.720 --> 22:22.760
SHE GROANS

22:24.400 --> 22:26.000
ATTRACTA SIGHS

22:26.000 --> 22:27.440
Attracta?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.800
I've brought something that I thought might help.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.080
Bless you.

22:40.520 --> 22:44.360
Well, the difficulty isn't that Paulette's unmarried, Mrs Roland.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.440
It's that she's diabetic.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.120
Will it make her worse?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.080
Possibly very much worse.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.120
So, what do we do?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.760
In certain cases,

22:53.760 --> 22:56.320
we advise a medically therapeutic

22:56.320 --> 22:57.960
termination of the pregnancy.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.120
Does that mean an abortion?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.920
Yes, it does, dear.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.760
That's against the law.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.760
Going up some back street, seeing some filthy woman...

23:07.760 --> 23:09.360
This would take place in hospital...

23:10.400 --> 23:11.680
..legally.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.200
Do you understand, Paulette?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.760
I understand you want to get rid of this baby.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.560
It's not a baby, Paulette.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.360
What are you - two months?

23:20.360 --> 23:23.040
By my reckoning, she's a little nearer three.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.360
Well, the solution's obvious, isn't it?

23:31.440 --> 23:33.280
Thank the Lord.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.720
You may find she becomes a little more responsive

23:35.720 --> 23:38.160
once she's taking in more liquid.

23:38.160 --> 23:42.560
Dehydration can worsen confusion when a person's very old...

23:42.560 --> 23:44.120
Or near the end.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
You take such wonderful care of her.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.480
I can hardly remember my own mother.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.200
Pegeen, she looked out for me since I was born.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.720
Found me a husband,

23:58.720 --> 24:00.360
decent lad.

24:00.360 --> 24:04.240
She had me promised to him since I was ten years old.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.200
And she taught me how to birth children,

24:06.200 --> 24:07.560
when the time came for that.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.400
You can't be comfortable kneeling there, Attracta.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.880
Let me take over.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.120
That'll be better for you.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.360
And for Baby.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.720
Yes.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.800
She bought me these gold earrings when I was born.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.280
We always gave gold,

24:42.280 --> 24:45.560
it's there to sell, or to barter if times are hard.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.440
But if I still have mine,

24:48.440 --> 24:51.560
if I've never come upon times as hard as that,

24:51.560 --> 24:54.600
it's because of her and all she taught me.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.960
I can never repay her what I owe.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.360
People go to prison for getting rid of babies.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.880
The mothers and the women who do it.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.720
They keep saying it's allowed,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.320
if you're sick and they do it in a hospital.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.120
Still a crime if you don't want it done,

25:14.120 --> 25:15.720
and we want that baby, don't we?

25:15.720 --> 25:16.920
Do you want it, Vaughn?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.280
I want you.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.760
I just...

25:21.760 --> 25:23.600
I feel like I'm such a liability,

25:23.600 --> 25:26.040
needing needles and wee tests every day,

25:26.040 --> 25:27.080
and now this...

25:28.320 --> 25:31.000
It's like people say when they get married,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.240
"In sickness and in health."

25:33.240 --> 25:34.840
We're not married, Vaughn.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.960
Not yet.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.560
I'm not going to say, "Do you mean that?"

25:40.560 --> 25:41.760
Cos I know you do.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.480
I'm not going to say, "Will you?"

25:47.480 --> 25:48.720
Cos I know the answer.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.560
It's absolutely beautiful.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.360
You say that as if you've never heard it before.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.160
I haven't, for a while.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.280
I've been mainly on district nursing duty.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.760
As this is your 11th pregnancy,

26:12.760 --> 26:15.640
we did wonder whether you should consider giving birth

26:15.640 --> 26:18.240
at the Maternity Home, when the time comes?

26:18.240 --> 26:21.400
We would still deliver Baby...

26:21.400 --> 26:24.360
Attracta, I'm not in the business of forcing you to obey orders,

26:24.360 --> 26:27.160
or to do anything that doesn't feel right.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.320
Whatever you want, I will try to provide for you.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.560
I don't want charity.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.520
It isn't the way we do things.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.120
If you tell me to go, I will,

26:41.120 --> 26:44.160
but Pegeen is too frail to help you,

26:44.160 --> 26:47.600
and I can't believe you really want to give birth on your own?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.600
No...

26:52.280 --> 26:53.400
..I don't.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.320
Now, since his visit yesterday,

26:58.320 --> 27:00.400
Dr Turner has arranged for Paulette

27:00.400 --> 27:03.360
to be referred to Mr Brockway at The London.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.120
His expertise is in the termination of pregnancy,

27:06.120 --> 27:08.560
regardless of the medical reason.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.480
I don't believe there is a medical reason.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.960
I think she's just making you say that there is.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.880
That's not the case at all.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.200
Baby may grow very large,

27:19.200 --> 27:22.080
develop abnormally, or even die.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.640
And I wish I could mince my words, Paulette,

27:24.640 --> 27:28.200
but I can't because your life will be in danger, too.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.880
DOORBELL RINGS

27:32.880 --> 27:35.480
You can at least let me do one thing for myself.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.880
Have you got children, Nurse Crane?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.400
No, Mrs Roland, I am a spinster.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.120
How dare you even come into my house.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.360
- I wanted to speak to you, Mrs Roland.
- Oh, you do, do you?

27:56.360 --> 27:58.960
- Sit down, Vaughn.
- No, I can't, I've not been invited.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.080
Look, you may think I'm no good, but I was brought up proper.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.480
On the fast track to Pentonville, more like.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.240
Mrs Roland. Why not hear the lad out?

28:07.240 --> 28:10.040
Because he's got nothing to say that I'd be interested in hearing.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.960
I want to marry Paulette, Mrs Roland.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.720
There's no need.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.640
There's every need. I love him, Mum. And I'm going to have a baby.

28:17.640 --> 28:22.600
No, you are not. Having this... child will put your life at risk!

28:22.600 --> 28:23.800
Conveniently for you.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.160
Vaughn, that's not the attitude.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
I think you should leave.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.320
I'll leave your house. But I won't leave her!

29:02.040 --> 29:03.840
Oh. Good evening.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.640
Um, I've got something of yours in this bag. And I'm really sorry.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.800
My hubcaps. I see.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.200
Well, very well, young man.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.960
These are no good to me until they are once more properly affixed

29:22.960 --> 29:25.360
to the wheels from which they were purloined.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.240
It wasn't me who did it.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.840
We'll discuss the finer points in due course.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.400
I did a bit of mechanics back in borstal.

29:40.920 --> 29:44.600
My probation officer reckons it'll stand me in good stead.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.800
Has he encouraged you to mention it at your interview?

29:47.800 --> 29:50.160
He's encouraged me to tell the truth.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.440
Prove I'm determined to be honest.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.520
Is that what this is all about?

29:54.520 --> 29:56.920
People think I'm a wrong 'un, Nurse Crane.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.800
But that's my family, not me.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.560
I don't want my baby got rid of,

30:03.560 --> 30:06.440
and I don't want it born a you-know-what either.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.560
You mean born outside of wedlock?

30:10.600 --> 30:13.280
Well, it's no start in life, is it?

30:13.280 --> 30:14.920
No, love. It isn't.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.720
But with diabetes in the picture,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.560
that's the least of everybody's worries.

30:20.360 --> 30:25.000
Look, me and Paulette know there's a chance it might go wrong.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.520
But it might not. And I love her.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.880
Her mum shouldn't be stood in our way.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.120
It's not my place to criticise.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.040
Not even my place to comment.

30:41.040 --> 30:46.760
All I would say is, speaking entirely from my own experience,

30:46.760 --> 30:49.320
is that when somebody thinks the worst of a person because

30:49.320 --> 30:53.880
of their background... such a lot can be lost.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.400
Did you have someone they thought was a wrong'un?

30:59.880 --> 31:01.280
No, kid.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.000
The wrong'un was me.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.440
Or maybe my mother.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.840
I was a you-know-what.

31:13.760 --> 31:17.240
All these years on, there's still no nice way of saying it.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.200
That's not fair.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.240
No.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.640
But it didn't stop me making something of myself.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.480
Anyway, young man, I want my vehicle restored to glory. Chop, chop.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.200
Afternoon, Mrs Gee.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.720
Oh! Mr Buckle!

31:46.440 --> 31:49.560
No need for formalities, I'm here on a personal matter.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.640
Oh. Cos you said Mrs Gee.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.280
I thought you must've come to check up on my map reading.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.720
I am getting better,

31:55.720 --> 31:58.920
but I still find it a bit difficult to tell my left from my right.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.840
- At least, if I have to do it in a hurry.
- Mrs Gee...

32:01.840 --> 32:03.600
- Violet.
- Violet.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.120
I wonder if you you'd do me the kindness of accompanying me

32:06.120 --> 32:08.360
to a function next Saturday night?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.840
Oh. A function...?

32:13.040 --> 32:16.160
It's in aid of the Cubs. Square dance.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.680
Do-si-do and all that.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.960
Perfect.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
Then you'll come?

32:22.960 --> 32:25.960
Yes. I will, Mr Buckle.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.600
Fred. Please.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.200
Thank you, Fred.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.720
SHE GIGGLES

32:40.000 --> 32:41.680
Not exactly a room with a view,

32:41.680 --> 32:44.840
but our residents are promised all the mod cons.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.200
My mum was beaming from ear to ear when you frogmarched me off.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.800
You've got me in your clutches now.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.160
What I didn't say in front of your mother, Paulette,

32:55.160 --> 32:59.120
is that Dr Turner's admitted you as a social case.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.240
Because of your situation at home.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.560
In what way is that supposed to help?

33:03.560 --> 33:05.720
You're as keen for me to get rid of it as she is.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.200
That's not the case at all.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.440
But you're a minor, you're under 21.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.680
And that means you can't make your own decisions.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.840
Would you let me keep it, if you were my mother?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.520
I'm not your mother, kid.

33:25.680 --> 33:30.640
If I were, there might be some things I'd do differently.

33:32.080 --> 33:36.880
But I'd still be worried sick about your health, and your baby's.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.760
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.400
Come on. Nightdress, dressing gown and slippers.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.600
Then you can impress me by doing your own jab.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.880
I thought your solution to the Paulette Roland case was rather clever.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.080
It's only temporary.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.120
I can't admit her as a maternity case,

34:06.120 --> 34:08.760
because the pregnancy isn't advanced enough.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.400
But there is a way around most things if you try.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.280
Wish I could think of a way round these name tapes.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.520
Even the socks have to be labelled individually,

34:17.520 --> 34:19.400
and I haven't even started.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.760
Ask for help.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.520
There's no need.

34:22.520 --> 34:27.040
Ask for help. Say you have too much to do.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.400
BABY CRIES

34:42.239 --> 34:43.560
No-one is invincible.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.120
No. They aren't.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.720
I wish you'd just come and sit down and get cracking.

35:10.040 --> 35:15.040
I think my eyes will not permit it. Indisposition has dimmed them.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.320
You mean disinclination has dimmed them!

35:18.320 --> 35:21.400
You're always harping on about wanting to be needed.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.480
Mrs Turner looked worn out when she brought these round.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.600
This reminds me of when I first came to the Order,

35:27.600 --> 35:31.200
and I had to mark my habit and my veil with my number.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.920
I always liked the idea that a Sister I'd never known had

35:34.920 --> 35:39.120
had my number once, and that one day another girl would get it.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.720
What is your number, child?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.600
I should have it in my mind,

35:43.600 --> 35:47.360
but it is erased by these pettifogging handicrafts.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.800
One-seven-nine.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.600
I think that was Mother Bertram's number.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.080
Oh, I don't think it can be.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.840
Mother Bertram was still alive when I joined.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.920
I shall repair to my room,

36:04.920 --> 36:09.400
and seek out my Latin dictionary to loan to our young student.

36:10.440 --> 36:14.320
That is a far greater service than any stitching on of labels.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.560
I don't mind telling you, my heart sank

36:18.560 --> 36:21.080
when I was told I was nursing her.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.880
Thank goodness I am used to the vow of Obedience.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.400
Did it take a long time?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.520
Years!

36:28.520 --> 36:29.920
SHE LAUGHS

36:29.920 --> 36:32.880
I still have hard days with it even now.

36:32.880 --> 36:36.760
Poverty was never a problem, and chastity - well,

36:36.760 --> 36:40.480
you offer that up, and in the end it's not something you think about.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.520
No.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.600
But not being able to have your head!

36:44.600 --> 36:47.920
Having to go where others feel you are called.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.840
Still.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.400
I've been told I can take the night shift

36:54.400 --> 36:56.720
at the Maternity Home on Saturday.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.440
That's something to cling to.

36:59.840 --> 37:05.120
You mark my words - the joy of midwifery never dims.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.680
Mr Brockway has asked for you to be transferred to The London

37:16.680 --> 37:18.360
this evening, Paulette.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.520
I thought you were going to let me stay here.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.000
There's a bed available now,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.760
and Mr Brockway wants to carry out the procedure within a day or two.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.160
My mum's agreed to this, hasn't she?

37:29.160 --> 37:32.560
We've arranged for an ambulance to pick you up at five.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.440
Your mother will come here and travel with you.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.160
HEATED ARGUING

37:52.880 --> 37:56.360
Sergeant Noakes? Whatever's happening?

37:56.360 --> 37:59.320
They've been served an eviction notice.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.320
There's a new law out. If they don't have a licence to run this

38:02.320 --> 38:04.720
as a campsite, then they have to leave.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.200
Well, can they apply for a licence?

38:07.200 --> 38:09.600
They could, I suppose, but that would take time.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.040
Well, that could be a good thing.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.240
There's a new baby here, another due soon,

38:14.240 --> 38:16.560
and an elderly lady who is dying!

38:19.640 --> 38:21.960
I know you have your work to do. But so do I.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.000
Come on, lads, let the Sister through.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.160
Move aside, please!

38:29.320 --> 38:30.360
Move aside!

38:34.800 --> 38:36.120
WOMAN GRUNTS IN PAIN

38:36.120 --> 38:37.160
Oh, no.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.440
Attracta? Are you in pain?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.240
Her time's come.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.440
Ohh...

38:49.440 --> 38:50.760
Right.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.920
SHE EXHALES

38:56.000 --> 39:00.240
I think I need to get you somewhere where you can lie down, Attracta.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.720
Where I can examine you, if you're agreeable -

39:02.720 --> 39:05.280
and we can decide what to do.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.000
You can let go of her hand, Pegeen.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.040
I'll take care of her. I promise.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.800
Knock, knock.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.840
You can come in.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.960
I told them the sight of all the babies was upsetting me.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.520
Are they letting you go?

39:35.520 --> 39:38.560
No. Tonight I'm being taken to The London.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.840
They want to do the operation as soon as possible.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.040
And it's easier to run away from here than there.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.400
I've got my interview at the print workers...

39:45.400 --> 39:46.840
I want you to come with me!

39:49.360 --> 39:51.440
Even if you won't, I'm going anyway.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.320
SHOUTING

40:03.080 --> 40:07.760
Sergeant Noakes. This has to stop. This lady is in labour.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.520
In labour? Well, can't you take her to hospital?

40:11.880 --> 40:14.920
She wants to give birth in her own home, which is here!

40:16.520 --> 40:20.240
No evictions, and no transfers to hospital are going to take place

40:20.240 --> 40:22.560
until I give my permission.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.680
Do you understand?

40:24.840 --> 40:25.880
Yes, Sister. I do.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.840
Right. All right.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.360
Let's get you through.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.560
Well done.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.920
Move away, please!

40:36.920 --> 40:42.000
All right. I've got you. Well done, Attracta, well done.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.760
There's a cousin of me mum's,

40:43.760 --> 40:46.480
we call her Auntie Flo, lives just outside of town.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.400
If we go there, I can leave you with her and come back for me interview.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.000
All right.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.160
It's a nice house. Not some slummy old place, and she's all right.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.240
She'll have to be, the mess we're in.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.960
But if you get that job, things will soon get better, won't they?

41:12.200 --> 41:14.160
They wouldn't let me in last night.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.720
Said she was tired, and needed to rest.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.840
That is one of the reasons why she's here...

41:21.640 --> 41:22.680
Oh, no..!

41:27.440 --> 41:28.840
Ohhhh....

41:30.000 --> 41:34.760
Push with the pain, Attracta. We want a big, strong, brave push...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.440
I haven't the strength.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.840
Listen to the Sister.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.480
Listen to you. Telling me all about it, now like you're suddenly the expert!

41:42.480 --> 41:45.520
You're the expert in this room, Attracta.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.720
I'm not...

41:46.720 --> 41:51.280
This is a brave, beautiful body that's done this many, many times.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.440
It knows the way. And so do you.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.440
SHE GROANS IN PAIN

41:58.480 --> 42:01.040
That's only the head, Attracta! You remember this!

42:04.240 --> 42:06.080
SHE GROANS IN PAIN

42:11.760 --> 42:14.480
CHEERING

42:20.360 --> 42:22.760
It's a boy, Attracta.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.160
A boy.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.520
A beautiful, beautiful boy.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.760
Oh, thank the Lord!

42:40.760 --> 42:41.840
Yes.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.520
And you, Sister.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.000
Thank you.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.320
Pegeen! What are you doing out of bed?

44:02.520 --> 44:04.760
BABY CRIES SOFTLY

44:06.480 --> 44:07.520
Come in, Pegeen.

44:10.920 --> 44:11.960
All's well.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.520
Another lad...

44:18.360 --> 44:20.440
Would you like to hold baby, Pegeen,

44:20.440 --> 44:23.840
while I help Attracta with the afterbirth?

44:23.840 --> 44:24.880
Sit down, love.

44:35.680 --> 44:39.720
You were there for my first. Now you're here for my last.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.920
No...

44:44.040 --> 44:45.080
I'm done.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.360
We're getting too old, Pegeen. The both of us.

44:57.720 --> 45:01.640
THEY SING A HYMN

45:55.680 --> 45:57.880
The Sisters did everything.

45:57.880 --> 45:58.920
Except these.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.360
Long trousers?

46:03.360 --> 46:06.120
I never had them when I was a kid.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.560
And I wanted them so much.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.560
Come on, let's get ready for the square dance.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.000
I'll get that for you. Hello, Sister.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.760
Oh, no...

47:15.000 --> 47:17.680
Aunt Flo's place is another day away, I reckon.

47:19.720 --> 47:23.480
There are no buses till tomorrow so we'll camp here tonight.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.800
Please, please take my jacket.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.920
You'll be freezing.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.160
You're shaking, Paulette.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.160
It's not the cold. My blood sugar's low.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.800
I need to eat, Vaughn.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.800
There's still apples left.

47:40.800 --> 47:41.960
No good on their own.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.440
MUSIC: Shop Around by The Miracles

47:52.440 --> 47:53.520
I have to say,

47:53.520 --> 47:56.920
I didn't think the circular skirt was a fashion I'd ever revisit.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.520
I'd forgotten how the petticoats scratch one's nylons.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.600
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

48:03.160 --> 48:05.440
I found a straggler, waiting in the hall.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.680
Hello, Deels!

48:06.680 --> 48:10.320
I brought us a bottle of Bourbon. It's a sort of American scotch!

48:10.320 --> 48:12.720
I've already told her I shan't be imbibing.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.960
I'm motorised this evening, in case

48:14.960 --> 48:17.120
we hear anything about young Paulette.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.280
Oh. Is there still no news?

48:19.280 --> 48:24.000
Not as yet. But there's no point in sitting home and moping.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.760
Charity beckons, we must heed the call.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.840
I've got some cream soda, Nurse Crane.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.560
You can have some of that.

48:31.560 --> 48:35.640
Thank you. And do call me Phyllis.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.960
Just for this evening.

48:41.120 --> 48:45.400
So, who's for a quick brightener? Just me, Pats and Trixie?

48:45.400 --> 48:49.040
Of course! Might take my mind off this appalling skirt.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.080
Chin-chin.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.680
You said you need to eat.

49:06.680 --> 49:09.880
The only place I could get tick was in a bakery.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.920
I just...I just feel a bit sick, that's all.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.560
I need another injection, but I've run out.

49:18.160 --> 49:22.760
I don't want anyone knowing where we are. They'd split us up.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.800
And get rid of our baby!

49:25.800 --> 49:28.000
But if that's what's best for you, though...

49:28.000 --> 49:29.520
How can it be best for me?

49:31.160 --> 49:32.440
It's not what I want.

49:37.440 --> 49:43.040
Sometimes, what's best for you isn't always what you want.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.360
Oh, look! It's the Lone Ranger!

50:33.360 --> 50:35.120
That's rather impolite,

50:35.120 --> 50:38.160
when we've come to raise money to send you on holiday.

Do you know your way to the community centre?

52:09.120 --> 52:13.640
- Yes.
- There's a dance on there. I want you to go and fetch Dr Turner.

52:13.640 --> 52:17.240
Now I'm going to rub some glucose powder on the inside of your cheek,

52:17.240 --> 52:19.160
to raise your blood sugar level.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.640
I want to dance with you.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.560
You ARE dancing with me!

52:30.560 --> 52:32.160
Yes - you and half of Poplar!

52:33.200 --> 52:36.680
I mean a foxtrot or a waltz. Even a tango.

52:36.680 --> 52:39.200
There isn't a place on Earth where that would happen.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.480
There must be. Somewhere.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.200
And until we find it, we'll just have to dance together in our heads.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.880
I've come for the doctor.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.680
# The sky has fallen down

53:07.680 --> 53:12.440
# In despair my heart does drown

53:12.440 --> 53:20.040
# I dread each day, the nights are far worse

53:20.040 --> 53:24.840
# From heartache I have no relief

53:24.840 --> 53:30.840
# Until the ground summons me beneath

53:30.840 --> 53:33.920
# This burden I bear

53:33.920 --> 53:40.080
# Each moment is a curse

53:40.080 --> 53:45.360
# From here I'll not wander more

53:45.360 --> 53:52.160
# The girl I left behind me... #

54:10.360 --> 54:11.880
Do you know anything about this?

54:16.520 --> 54:18.480
Open up. Open up!

54:23.280 --> 54:25.560
There's a bucket in the corner.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.960
It's not that. I've got a job interview this morning.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.440
Good luck with that(!)

54:29.440 --> 54:32.280
Look. You can make one phone call. Who do you want? Your brief,

54:32.280 --> 54:34.640
or your probation officer?

54:36.360 --> 54:37.400
Neither of them.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.400
I just got your message, Vaughn.

54:41.400 --> 54:42.520
Is Paulette all right?

54:42.520 --> 54:45.080
She will be. One way or another.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.680
It's not what I wanted. None of that.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.720
None of this.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.840
I know.

54:49.840 --> 54:52.280
But you did the right thing,

54:52.280 --> 54:55.040
and I'll make sure that's said before the court.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.040
Will you tell her I love her?

55:01.040 --> 55:02.160
Consider it done.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.160
Thank you.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.720
They'll bring you something to calm you down now.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.480
You won't have to keep looking at the clock then.

Nurse Crane said you would have been dead already

55:40.000 --> 55:41.400
if it wasn't for Vaughn.

55:45.160 --> 55:50.480
I reckon he must love you as much as I do.

55:56.080 --> 56:00.480
And doctors find new things out all the time.

56:00.480 --> 56:04.480
Who knows? In a year or two, you might have another baby.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.400
Things might be completely different then.

56:11.240 --> 56:14.960
I'll make sure Vaughn gets a message, when you're out of theatre.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.920
I was waiting for ya.

56:45.920 --> 56:47.840
My aunt said I was to give you this.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.960
I shouldn't accept this...

56:55.960 --> 56:58.760
I'm not supposed to have personal possessions.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.640
Well, let's say it's ours, and we're just lending it to you.
