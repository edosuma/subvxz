And since we do have you here,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.018

share an idea with you.

Kind of, um, well,
a business proposition of sorts.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.612

playing gay chicken.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.947
Sometimes when i get drunk,

09:09.015 --> 09:10.148
i go to boston market,
i eat chicken.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.216
We're like the same dudes.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.984

You're sober now.

09:25.464 --> 09:26.765
Why don't we get
to the bottom of this?

09:26.832 --> 09:28.400
Just kiss each other real quick,
you know,

09:28.467 --> 09:30.101
and then you'll
probably hate it,

09:30.169 --> 09:31.670
and we can get to this proposal,
'cause i got some ideas.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.338

09:33.406 --> 09:35.307
One time, little thing,
you'll see it was just a fluke,

09:35.374 --> 09:37.242
and we'll move on with the day.
- Mm-hmm.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.578

Or you can just not do that.
