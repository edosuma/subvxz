<font color="#f0f900">What is a man willing to die?</font>

01:43.729 --> 01:46.699
<font color="#f0f900">What can be more important than your own life?</font>

01:46.857 --> 01:49.610
<font color="#f0f900">It could be that the answers to these questions</font>

01:49.776 --> 01:52.905

01:57.826 --> 02:02.377
<font color="#f0f900">Primarily probably thanks to its creator.</font>

02:03.582 --> 02:08.133
<font color="#f0f900">It is said that "Mafia" is capable</font>

02:08.294 --> 02:11.299
<font color="#f0f900">People to put in extreme anxiety.</font>

02:12.090 --> 02:15.594
<font color="#f0f900">And how exciting it is to see,</font>

02:15.969 --> 02:19.223
<font color="#f0f900">what happens to a man who is not afraid?</font>

02:24.645 --> 02:30.618
<font color="#f0f900">Dear Participants, I am pleased to welcome you to the Mafia show.</font>

02:30.734 --> 02:34.364
<font color="#f0f900">The rules are simple: in our studio are eleven players.</font>

02:34.529 --> 02:37.703
<font color="#f0f900">Nine of them are civilians, and two belong to the Mafia.</font>

02:37.824 --> 02:39.792
<font color="#f0f900">The players do not know who belongs to which group.</font>

02:39.951 --> 02:42.955
<font color="#f0f900">The object of civilians is to find out during the game,</font>

02:43.121 --> 02:45.123
<font color="#f0f900">who heard of the participants to the Mafia.</font>

02:45.248 --> 02:49.503
<font color="#f0f900">However, the Mafia has to pretend that they were civilians, to get to the final.</font>

02:49.628 --> 02:53.349
<font color="#f0f900">Every night killing the Mafia a civilian.</font>

02:53.465 --> 02:56.093
<font color="#f0f900">The faster the civilians find out who belongs to the Mafia,</font>

02:56.259 --> 02:58.478
<font color="#f0f900">the more of them stay alive.</font>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.142
<font color="#f0f900">The prize money for this game is one billion rubles.</font>

03:03.266 --> 03:05.689
<font color="#f0f900">Who will divide the money among themselves?</font>

03:05.811 --> 03:08.234
<font color="#f0f900">The Mafia, or the civilians?</font>

03:08.730 --> 03:11.779
<font color="#f0f900">Are you ready? Then it starts!</font>

03:13.694 --> 03:15.537
<font color="#f0f900">Lift up your right hand.</font>

03:15.696 --> 03:18.666
<font color="#f0f900">The computer is now to the random principle</font>

03:18.740 --> 03:22.165
<font color="#f0f900">divided into mafia and civilians.</font>

03:39.720 --> 03:41.518
<font color="#f0f900">The roles are distributed.</font>

03:41.638 --> 03:44.437
<font color="#f0f900">From now on, just know our computer, who belongs to which group.</font>

03:44.558 --> 03:47.152
<font color="#f0f900">Each participant sees only its own barcode</font>

03:47.269 --> 03:51.149
<font color="#f0f900">and speaks with absolute certainty only for themselves.</font>

03:51.356 --> 03:56.578
<font color="#f0f900">The Mafia members are still unknown and potentially all civilians.</font>

03:56.695 --> 03:59.073
<font color="#f0f900">speak a word of welcome Traditional allowed any with us.</font>

03:59.156 --> 04:02.205
<font color="#f0f900">Participants in chair number 1. If they belong to the Mafia?</font>

04:02.451 --> 04:03.998
<font color="#f0f900">Probably to the players.</font>

04:04.870 --> 04:09.546
<font color="#f0f900">Luka Sergejevich is, with 85 years the oldest participant of the game.</font>

04:09.666 --> 04:13.261
<font color="#f0f900">Modern medicine enables him but to look much younger.</font>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.172
<font color="#f0f900">Luka is a billionaire.</font>

04:15.338 --> 04:19.593
<font color="#f0f900">Out of nowhere, he has built a solid investment companies.</font>

04:19.760 --> 04:23.981
<font color="#f0f900">Luka likes to play for his lifetime. That's his motivation to participate in the game.</font>

04:24.139 --> 04:26.767
<font color="#f0f900">He has often risked his life</font>

04:26.892 --> 04:28.986
<font color="#f0f900">and this seems to be a reason for his fortune.</font>

04:29.394 --> 04:32.147
<font color="#f0f900">His grandchildren are just waiting that her grandfather dies.</font>

04:32.272 --> 04:35.993
<font color="#f0f900">But it hardly employs just over his gambling addiction.</font>

04:36.568 --> 04:40.914
<font color="#f0f900">More than anything, afraid Luka to lose the joy of living.</font>

04:41.031 --> 04:44.877
<font color="#f0f900">The Iistige Luka Sergejevich has devised a Bitch for his relatives:</font>

04:45.118 --> 04:47.917
<font color="#f0f900">According to his New Testament his grandchildren inherit absolutely nothing,</font>

04:48.038 --> 04:50.587
<font color="#f0f900">if he dies during the game.</font>

04:50.707 --> 04:54.302
<font color="#f0f900">That is why they are with their grandpa cheer like never before in her life.</font>

04:54.461 --> 04:59.308
<font color="#f0f900">Unfortunately I have to say no: I did not belong to the Mafia.</font>

04:59.800 --> 05:02.144
<font color="#f0f900">For Player ID. 2</font>

05:02.302 --> 05:04.555
<font color="#f0f900">The only thing I want is to win,</font>

05:05.096 --> 05:07.565
<font color="#f0f900">because I have nothing to lose.</font>

05:07.682 --> 05:10.777
<font color="#f0f900">EII, 38 years old, engineer.</font>

05:11.478 --> 05:15.699
<font color="#f0f900">The doctors have found incurable thyroid cancer in him.</font>

05:16.233 --> 05:19.407
<font color="#f0f900">He has to live much longer than three months.</font>

05:19.611 --> 05:23.741
<font color="#f0f900">More than anything else fears EII that his family is left with no money.</font>

05:23.907 --> 05:26.001
<font color="#f0f900">Win one billion rubles in the Mafia Sho w!</font>

05:26.117 --> 05:29.496
<font color="#f0f900">And, for this opportunity to secure the welfare of his family</font>

05:29.621 --> 05:33.876
<font color="#f0f900">he is ready to die earlier. Although his wife, however, was very.</font>

05:34.084 --> 05:36.837
<font color="#f0f900">They would rather have the three months spent with their loved ones</font>

05:37.003 --> 05:39.426
<font color="#f0f900">and rather accompanies him quietly dying,</font>

05:39.589 --> 05:43.719
<font color="#f0f900">instead of looking at the television, as he dies in agony.</font>

05:44.010 --> 05:47.810
<font color="#f0f900">And moreover, in the knowledge of having to share it with millions of viewers.</font>

05:48.557 --> 05:52.107
<font color="#f0f900">And what do player number 3 and number 4 player?</font>

05:52.227 --> 05:55.151
<font color="#f0f900">They have drawn the Hapless.</font>

05:55.272 --> 06:01.154
<font color="#f0f900">You do not play for the money. For you it's about the "special price".</font>

06:04.322 --> 06:06.950
<font color="#f0f900">The government and the Mafia-Show</font>

06:07.075 --> 06:09.919
<font color="#f0f900">continue with its unprecedented "GIÃ¼ckslos" program.</font>

06:10.078 --> 06:13.082
<font color="#f0f900">Every prisoner of our country can in</font>

06:13.206 --> 06:15.925
<font color="#f0f900">regardless of the severity of his crime</font>

06:16.084 --> 06:18.837
<font color="#f0f900">and the resulting penalty, regain his freedom.</font>

06:18.962 --> 06:21.636
<font color="#f0f900">Has ever a managed?</font>

06:22.299 --> 06:26.020
<font color="#f0f900">He has to win for only the Mafia show.</font>

06:28.471 --> 06:31.771
<font color="#f0f900">I would like to say that my trial was staged.</font>

06:31.975 --> 06:34.774
<font color="#f0f900">My process was also staged. Oh shit.</font>

06:34.853 --> 06:37.823
<font color="#f0f900">Stop crying. Let's go on dear. Come on!</font>

06:37.939 --> 06:40.533
<font color="#f0f900">Player ID 4, you're in the Mafia or not?</font>

06:40.650 --> 06:42.618
<font color="#f0f900">Not with the Mafia.</font>

06:42.736 --> 06:45.990
<font color="#f0f900">Mr. Butcher, you are in the Mafia? - Mr. Butcher ...</font>

06:46.114 --> 06:51.371
<font color="#f0f900">Mr. Butcher is also not in the Mafia. And it's also damn him again matter.</font>

06:51.703 --> 06:54.627
<font color="#f0f900">But true, I want here no money, but to freedom.</font>

06:54.748 --> 06:56.876
<font color="#f0f900">And then I will have my revenge.</font>

06:57.000 --> 07:01.096
<font color="#f0f900">Well, we now provide the next player the word.</font>

07:01.713 --> 07:05.468
<font color="#f0f900">What should I tell you even after this rigmarole?</font>

07:06.051 --> 07:09.396
<font color="#f0f900">I'm not in the Mafia, I give you my word as an officer.</font>

07:13.516 --> 07:16.736
<font color="#f0f900">So'n bullshit! Tell me one time,</font>

07:16.895 --> 07:19.614
<font color="#f0f900">why did you let so many simply die of your people?</font>

07:19.940 --> 07:22.443
<font color="#f0f900">Probably just to sit here to what?</font>

07:23.026 --> 07:27.623
<font color="#f0f900">And now finally our beautiful ladies at the series.</font>

07:28.323 --> 07:31.497
<font color="#f0f900">I'm not in the Mafia and am glad.</font>

07:31.618 --> 07:35.373
<font color="#f0f900">I sit here in order to process my past.</font>

07:36.081 --> 07:38.209
<font color="#f0f900">I'm here to ...</font>

07:39.709 --> 07:43.634
<font color="#f0f900">to my old life to get back. The current ...</font>

07:44.589 --> 07:46.808
<font color="#f0f900">I do not need that.</font>

07:46.967 --> 07:50.312
<font color="#f0f900">And I want to see in this game, what I'm capable.</font>

07:50.720 --> 07:54.315
<font color="#f0f900">My participation in this game you should not lead to false conclusions.</font>

07:54.557 --> 07:57.936
<font color="#f0f900">The game will reveal everything. - I had no choice.</font>

07:59.145 --> 08:02.524
<font color="#f0f900">Let's say this is my fate.</font>

08:03.316 --> 08:05.614
<font color="#f0f900">That's all.</font>

08:06.528 --> 08:10.203
<font color="#f0f900">I'm too 'mafia' came to realize my dream.</font>

08:11.449 --> 08:15.955
<font color="#f0f900">And I will prove to everyone that the impossible is possible.</font>

08:18.081 --> 08:20.925
<font color="#f0f900">Well, now we all a little acquainted.</font>

08:21.042 --> 08:25.639
<font color="#f0f900">We will certainly find out in the course of the game a lot about our players.</font>

08:25.839 --> 08:28.012
<font color="#f0f900">And now I start the countdown of ten minutes.</font>

08:28.133 --> 08:31.603
<font color="#f0f900">The first voting begins. Here we go.</font>

09:03.251 --> 09:06.551
<font color="#f0f900">How is it looking? Has no one have any suggestions?</font>

09:06.713 --> 09:10.058
<font color="#f0f900">So I would suggest we choose this bum because of.</font>

09:10.592 --> 09:13.095
<font color="#f0f900">The has long afterlife.</font>

09:14.929 --> 09:17.148
<font color="#f0f900">Shut up, asshole. I warn you.</font>

09:17.307 --> 09:20.106
<font color="#f0f900">Walter, do not be a on a dispute which does not help.</font>

09:20.810 --> 09:24.189
<font color="#f0f900">I think we should use our time a little more effective.</font>

09:25.690 --> 09:28.569
<font color="#f0f900">Does anyone have an idea for the first choice?</font>

09:29.194 --> 09:32.118
<font color="#f0f900">Konstantin? - No, this round I abstain.</font>

09:33.281 --> 09:37.002
<font color="#f0f900">I want to wait. - If so, then I will</font>

09:37.118 --> 09:42.796
<font color="#f0f900">Suggest someone. My intuition tells me that in the Mafia</font>

09:43.291 --> 09:45.589
<font color="#f0f900">a younger man</font>

09:46.878 --> 09:49.176
<font color="#f0f900">called</font>

09:49.547 --> 09:51.515
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran.</font>

09:55.220 --> 09:57.689
<font color="#f0f900">Why should we lose time?</font>

09:59.099 --> 10:01.147
<font color="#f0f900">Yes well, Kieran.</font>

10:02.018 --> 10:05.022
<font color="#f0f900">Who else is this? - Hey wait times.</font>

10:05.522 --> 10:09.277
<font color="#f0f900">I know this couple. Have times in jail saw a movie about them.</font>

10:09.442 --> 10:11.865
<font color="#f0f900">She is a dancer,</font>

10:12.487 --> 10:14.831
<font color="#f0f900">the so weird rumhampelt. Is it so?</font>

10:15.490 --> 10:19.836
<font color="#f0f900">You animal but have not the slightest idea what you're talking about.</font>

10:20.370 --> 10:24.295
<font color="#f0f900">Marie is 24 years old. She was an outstanding ballerina.</font>

10:24.457 --> 10:26.630
<font color="#f0f900">An extremely talented dancer.</font>

10:27.502 --> 10:31.427
<font color="#f0f900">Until her 21 years to her career developed splendidly.</font>

10:41.391 --> 10:44.986
<font color="#f0f900">But by a terrible accident</font>

10:45.145 --> 10:47.273
<font color="#f0f900">took her career to an abrupt end.</font>

10:51.818 --> 10:56.164
<font color="#f0f900">Although it was made after several months already somewhat again,</font>

10:56.281 --> 10:58.909
<font color="#f0f900">of ballet could be no more talk!</font>

10:59.075 --> 11:02.545
<font color="#f0f900">Marie's return to the stage would be possible only by a synthetic prosthesis,</font>

11:03.037 --> 11:06.541
<font color="#f0f900">by which they could move to 100% their feet again.</font>

11:06.666 --> 11:09.294
<font color="#f0f900">However, the prosthesis and it required major surgery,</font>

11:09.377 --> 11:13.132
<font color="#f0f900">cost an enormous sum that Marie has not.</font>

11:13.506 --> 11:18.228
<font color="#f0f900">A couple of years she went from door to door to raise the money.</font>

11:18.386 --> 11:21.936
<font color="#f0f900">But you did not even get 10 percent of the sum together.</font>

11:22.056 --> 11:24.354
<font color="#f0f900">She is desperate.</font>

11:24.475 --> 11:27.820
<font color="#f0f900">Do you have the courage? Then fill out the questionnaire,</font>

11:27.896 --> 11:31.617
<font color="#f0f900">there the test, and will be invited to the most popular show of the We / t.</font>

11:31.774 --> 11:34.618
<font color="#f0f900">Mafia. This is their last chance</font>

11:34.736 --> 11:38.661
<font color="#f0f900">return to the stage and to give her life meaning again.</font>

11:39.115 --> 11:43.837
<font color="#f0f900">Since this accident Marie has terrified of rain, thunder and lightning.</font>

11:43.995 --> 11:47.215
<font color="#f0f900">This type because that is their Fickfreund,</font>

11:47.373 --> 11:50.047
<font color="#f0f900">I've in urine. With whom do we want to start?</font>

11:50.126 --> 11:53.221
<font color="#f0f900">The Hampel aunt or her little lapdog.</font>

11:53.755 --> 11:57.259
<font color="#f0f900">So, you do not know Marie, right?</font>

12:01.679 --> 12:04.853
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, we know each other for many years,</font>

12:04.933 --> 12:09.063
<font color="#f0f900">I and Marie Vladimirovna.</font>

12:09.479 --> 12:12.323
<font color="#f0f900">Fool! What's that now?</font>

12:12.899 --> 12:15.277
<font color="#f0f900">We have no agreement, really, that's right!</font>

12:17.237 --> 12:20.366
<font color="#f0f900">For many years I have been following her career.</font>

12:20.531 --> 12:26.584
<font color="#f0f900">And when the terrible accident happened, I wanted to help somehow.</font>

12:26.663 --> 12:29.837
<font color="#f0f900">I even sold my apartment, so they ... - I want nothing from you!</font>

12:30.208 --> 12:33.678
<font color="#f0f900">I do not love you, do you hear? I have never loved you!</font>

12:41.052 --> 12:43.396
<font color="#f0f900">Marie Vladimirovna,</font>

12:43.721 --> 12:47.476
<font color="#f0f900">let them not clarify this here. This is not the place for it.</font>

12:47.642 --> 12:50.862
<font color="#f0f900">Why can not you leave me alone?</font>

12:51.020 --> 12:54.069
<font color="#f0f900">Once again you've messed everything!</font>

12:54.232 --> 12:56.701
<font color="#f0f900">Well, nice shit, huh?</font>

12:56.818 --> 13:01.699
<font color="#f0f900">I ask you again: Who we do first flat? - So, I would say</font>

13:01.864 --> 13:04.037
<font color="#f0f900">Marie.</font>

13:27.098 --> 13:30.318
<font color="#f0f900">Stop! Stop. Please wait. You're welcome.</font>

13:37.442 --> 13:42.118
<font color="#f0f900">Now, if only to get a voice</font>

13:42.613 --> 13:45.662
<font color="#f0f900">then that means the majority. I ask you.</font>

13:45.742 --> 13:48.791
<font color="#f0f900">I beg you! Select dear ...</font>

13:50.455 --> 13:54.426
<font color="#f0f900">They prefer to choose me instead. I i...</font>

13:54.625 --> 13:57.674
<font color="#f0f900">I'm in the Mafia! That's the truth.</font>

13:57.795 --> 14:00.423
<font color="#f0f900">One can not see, but I'm really ...</font>

14:00.673 --> 14:05.349
<font color="#f0f900">in the Mafia. Please choose me! - The votes were cast.</font>

14:15.438 --> 14:18.362
<font color="#f0f900">That concludes the vote.</font>

14:24.572 --> 14:28.543
<font color="#f0f900">No, that ... 
can not be.</font>

14:30.620 --> 14:33.123
<font color="#f0f900">I am innocent.</font>

14:34.082 --> 14:36.710
<font color="#f0f900">I'm not in the Mafia.</font>

14:37.085 --> 14:40.806
<font color="#f0f900">The time has come to find out whether the participants</font>

14:40.922 --> 14:43.516
<font color="#f0f900">were wrong with their choice.</font>

14:49.972 --> 14:54.102
<font color="#f0f900">Marie is one of the civilians.</font>

15:05.488 --> 15:07.331
<font color="#f0f900">I have to say goodbye well.</font>

15:11.744 --> 15:14.793
<font color="#f0f900">May the gods be with you.</font>

15:22.588 --> 15:24.761
<font color="#f0f900">Let me out! Immediately!</font>

17:34.762 --> 17:40.144
<font color="#f0f900">I bring you the first death in the 57th season of "Mafia"</font>

17:40.643 --> 17:46.025
<font color="#f0f900">the most popular show in the history of television.</font>

17:46.440 --> 17:52.868
<font color="#f0f900">The game, in which people are willing to risk their lives for the victory.</font>

17:53.030 --> 17:57.001
<font color="#f0f900">The game, in which one really dies.</font>

18:15.386 --> 18:17.605
<font color="#f0f900">HERE LIVES THE MOTHER OF A MURDERER</font>

18:32.903 --> 18:36.123
<font color="#f0f900">Every year the same mistakes. Boring.</font>

18:36.449 --> 18:39.623
<font color="#f0f900">That they know them, does not mean that they are in the mafia.</font>

18:40.369 --> 18:44.419
<font color="#f0f900">The first Night falls on our town in.</font>

18:44.540 --> 18:47.043
<font color="#f0f900">And only the two Mafia members can see</font>

18:47.209 --> 18:49.962
<font color="#f0f900">and have the right to the first train in the dark.</font>

18:50.087 --> 18:55.514
<font color="#f0f900">It's time to fire the first shot, and select his victim.</font>

19:02.099 --> 19:06.149
<font color="#f0f900">The city falls asleep.</font>

19:08.147 --> 19:12.368
<font color="#f0f900">And the Mafia wakes.</font>

19:15.071 --> 19:20.168
<font color="#f0f900">Now every civilian is just a step away from death.</font>

19:27.333 --> 19:29.677
<font color="#f0f900">The selection was made.</font>

19:29.835 --> 19:34.056
<font color="#f0f900">The remarkable thing is that our mafia members were very quick to agree.</font>

19:34.382 --> 19:36.680
<font color="#f0f900">Who will not wake up this morning?</font>

19:36.801 --> 19:39.975
<font color="#f0f900">For whom the game is already over?</font>

19:40.137 --> 19:44.893
<font color="#f0f900">The first victim of the Mafia in this year ...</font>

19:45.476 --> 19:51.074
<font color="#f0f900">Konstantin, you know maybe, who was selected by the Mafia?</font>

19:51.190 --> 19:53.659
<font color="#f0f900">I do.</font>

19:54.610 --> 19:57.454
<font color="#f0f900">So I was not selected.</font>

19:58.656 --> 20:01.910
<font color="#f0f900">And everything else does not interest me.</font>

20:02.076 --> 20:04.829
<font color="#f0f900">Well, then I will no longer suspense you.</font>

20:04.954 --> 20:08.675
<font color="#f0f900">The following person is no longer wakes up after that night ...</font>

20:10.626 --> 20:13.505
<font color="#f0f900">Mr. Butcher.</font>

20:21.387 --> 20:24.391
<font color="#f0f900">Hey, the LÃ¼genschwein.</font>

20:24.765 --> 20:28.815
<font color="#f0f900">What Iaberst there for a shit? What shoud that?</font>

20:29.311 --> 20:33.157
<font color="#f0f900">Are you kidding me? Do not you see that I'm awake?</font>

20:33.733 --> 20:36.111
<font color="#f0f900">Verrecke, you swine.</font>

20:36.444 --> 20:37.991
<font color="#f0f900">Who said that?</font>

20:39.196 --> 20:42.291
<font color="#f0f900">That was me. Verrecke, you swine.</font>

20:42.658 --> 20:46.583
<font color="#f0f900">You idiot. Have sold for nothing your apartment.</font>

20:46.787 --> 20:50.007
<font color="#f0f900">You are all idiots. Your bastards.</font>

20:52.710 --> 20:56.214
<font color="#f0f900">Rejoice not too early. I will come back.</font>

20:56.547 --> 21:00.768
<font color="#f0f900">And then I'm going to slaughter all their bums.</font>

21:09.727 --> 21:13.277
<font color="#f0f900">You will not die on an electric chair.</font>

21:14.356 --> 21:17.360
<font color="#f0f900">For you, we have come up with something special.</font>

21:17.526 --> 21:19.324
<font color="#f0f900">A feast for the eyes!</font>

21:21.113 --> 21:25.118
<font color="#f0f900">Now we come to your phobias. - To what?</font>

21:25.326 --> 21:29.547
<font color="#f0f900">Your fears. Just answer yes or no.</font>

21:31.415 --> 21:32.712
<font color="#f0f900">Then do it.</font>

21:33.334 --> 21:36.383
<font color="#f0f900">So ... Have fear of loneliness?</font>

21:37.755 --> 21:42.602
<font color="#f0f900">Before the single cell I have none. - Against Poverty? Misery?</font>

21:42.968 --> 21:46.063
<font color="#f0f900">Because I showed the rich pigs, where to go?</font>

21:46.680 --> 21:49.980
<font color="#f0f900">They were just jealous on. - You stupid ...</font>

21:50.351 --> 21:53.981
<font color="#f0f900">You stupid bastard. I can not suffer intestinal eaters.</font>

21:54.104 --> 21:56.983
<font color="#f0f900">Who? - I mean greedy fucker.</font>

21:57.483 --> 22:00.487
<font color="#f0f900">I think slowly that you're the loony of us.</font>

22:11.789 --> 22:14.759
<font color="#f0f900">I hope you burn in hell.</font>

22:19.004 --> 22:22.053
<font color="#f0f900">Are you afraid of death?</font>

22:25.594 --> 22:27.938
<font color="#f0f900">I want it this way say you Witzfigur,</font>

22:31.058 --> 22:33.686
<font color="#f0f900">Like a man dying, before that I am not afraid.</font>

22:35.479 --> 22:39.234
<font color="#f0f900">But before such an asshole to die.</font>

26:12.404 --> 26:14.827
<font color="#f0f900">Now I'll finally be free again!</font>

26:27.795 --> 26:31.390
<font color="#f0f900">Dear participants, dear viewers, we have all seen,</font>

26:31.507 --> 26:34.977
<font color="#f0f900">how brave Mr. Butcher has struggled.</font>

26:35.052 --> 26:37.555
<font color="#f0f900">But our game is unpredictable.</font>

26:38.055 --> 26:42.777
<font color="#f0f900">Look at the Mafia show, and I announce a new vote.</font>

26:42.893 --> 26:45.567
<font color="#f0f900">I would like to say that with each additional vote</font>

26:45.687 --> 26:48.236
<font color="#f0f900">, time is shorter.</font>

26:48.357 --> 26:52.863
<font color="#f0f900">I set the clock time on eight minutes.</font>

26:56.615 --> 26:58.663
<font color="#f0f900">That's what he deserves.</font>

26:58.784 --> 27:04.041
<font color="#f0f900">What do you mean by that? - The pig has deserved death.</font>

27:04.665 --> 27:08.795
<font color="#f0f900">I think we should now perhaps say what we really mean.</font>

27:09.586 --> 27:12.180
<font color="#f0f900">I can say exactly who is in the Mafia.</font>

27:12.464 --> 27:16.344
<font color="#f0f900">Konstantin. Even as a child he had clairvoyant abilities.</font>

27:16.468 --> 27:19.142
<font color="#f0f900">In school, he could predict poor grades.</font>

27:19.263 --> 27:22.016
<font color="#f0f900">As a teenager, he predicted the girls that they are cheated.</font>

27:22.182 --> 27:25.152
<font color="#f0f900">People began to call him the "black messenger".</font>

27:25.269 --> 27:30.366
<font color="#f0f900">On participation in parapsychological television shows he always renounced.</font>

27:30.482 --> 27:34.328
<font color="#f0f900">Officially, he works as a consultant in crisis situations.</font>

27:35.237 --> 27:38.958
<font color="#f0f900">His greatest fear is to die of old age.</font>

27:39.491 --> 27:42.620
<font color="#f0f900">In the Mafia is ...</font>

27:45.664 --> 27:46.836
<font color="#f0f900">Peter.</font>

27:50.752 --> 27:54.006
<font color="#f0f900">Nostradamus. Na toll.</font>

27:55.215 --> 28:00.142
<font color="#f0f900">If you knew everything, why did you let her die? Hm?</font>

28:00.262 --> 28:03.482
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, that's all really quite terrible terrible.</font>

28:03.974 --> 28:09.322
<font color="#f0f900">Yes? - I would like all relatives those</font>

28:09.521 --> 28:13.196
<font color="#f0f900">who do not return for this match, say that I really am Ieid.</font>

28:14.401 --> 28:18.122
<font color="#f0f900">Remember, once the two Mafia members are uncovered,</font>

28:18.197 --> 28:21.371
<font color="#f0f900">the prize will be split among the civilians.</font>

28:22.326 --> 28:24.328
<font color="#f0f900">But I do not want that.</font>

28:24.870 --> 28:27.794
<font color="#f0f900">I want to see the Mafia dead</font>

28:28.457 --> 28:31.256
<font color="#f0f900">but too many civilians I do not want too.</font>

28:31.835 --> 28:34.054
<font color="#f0f900">You know what?</font>

28:34.254 --> 28:36.427
<font color="#f0f900">That's disgusting.</font>

28:36.548 --> 28:39.222
<font color="#f0f900">Well. - Dost yourself for a tough-guy thing?</font>

28:40.844 --> 28:45.520
<font color="#f0f900">If you had been in my military unit, I would have you</font>

28:45.974 --> 28:51.196
<font color="#f0f900">hand executed. - We are not in your military unit Fortunately.</font>

28:51.772 --> 28:54.651
<font color="#f0f900">Let us take a decision.</font>

28:55.192 --> 28:58.412
<font color="#f0f900">Whoever believes Konstantin? - I.</font>

29:00.948 --> 29:03.246
<font color="#f0f900">I think Konstantin.</font>

29:03.367 --> 29:06.871
<font color="#f0f900">So I belong to the Mafia. And now I say unto you,</font>

29:06.995 --> 29:11.091
<font color="#f0f900">who is still in the Mafia. - Does this mean we win too fast?</font>

29:13.669 --> 29:18.516
<font color="#f0f900">Then indeed our Constantine would have to share the prize with many.</font>

29:20.676 --> 29:23.020
<font color="#f0f900">Must not he.</font>

29:24.054 --> 29:26.523
<font color="#f0f900">And therefore,</font>

29:27.224 --> 29:30.444
<font color="#f0f900">because our Konstantin in Mafia is.</font>

29:31.812 --> 29:35.066
<font color="#f0f900">Oh, I will not say anything more.</font>

29:36.400 --> 29:39.028
<font color="#f0f900">Then I will be killed first.</font>

29:39.361 --> 29:44.618
<font color="#f0f900">Because then I'll finally learn what it's like to be dead.</font>

29:44.783 --> 29:48.083
<font color="#f0f900">Wait, what meaning results mean?</font>

29:48.245 --> 29:51.294
<font color="#f0f900">If Konstantin is in the Mafia, then why kill his accomplice?</font>

29:51.957 --> 29:55.302
<font color="#f0f900">To the price does not have to share. Is quite logical.</font>

29:56.378 --> 29:58.972
<font color="#f0f900">Who Konstantin is, raise your hand!</font>

30:05.304 --> 30:09.855
<font color="#f0f900">I do not trust these devilish predictions simply do not.</font>

30:10.309 --> 30:15.486
<font color="#f0f900">Forgiveness. - And I think someone who has nothing to lose, just more.</font>

30:16.273 --> 30:19.026
<font color="#f0f900">Three votes for Konstantin are logged.</font>

30:19.359 --> 30:23.284
<font color="#f0f900">Whoever believes in fact that Peter is in the Mafia?</font>

30:50.849 --> 30:54.319
<font color="#f0f900">Six votes for Peter. That concludes the vote.</font>

30:55.103 --> 30:59.404
<font color="#f0f900">Now the question only remains open as to whether the selection of players was right.</font>

31:02.277 --> 31:05.451
<font color="#f0f900">To hell with you, with you all.</font>

31:06.323 --> 31:09.543
<font color="#f0f900">So I come quickly to Marie.</font>

31:13.830 --> 31:17.084
<font color="#f0f900">Peter is a civilian.</font>

31:44.194 --> 31:47.038
<font color="#f0f900">So, there's this woman,</font>

31:47.614 --> 31:51.835
<font color="#f0f900">for whom I have great fear. Huge.</font>

31:53.078 --> 31:57.709
<font color="#f0f900">You love her very much, right? - Yes. - Since you have a reason to.</font>

31:58.417 --> 32:03.765
<font color="#f0f900">Try to remember what it was like before meeting with this woman.</font>

32:04.381 --> 32:06.884
<font color="#f0f900">Earlier, when you were a kid,</font>

32:08.051 --> 32:10.270
<font color="#f0f900">had you as afraid of something?</font>

32:12.180 --> 32:15.650
<font color="#f0f900">And as they got older? - I really had nothing to fear.</font>

32:21.273 --> 32:23.446
<font color="#f0f900">But, I remember.</font>

32:25.444 --> 32:26.912
<font color="#f0f900">When I was little...</font>

32:29.906 --> 32:34.082
<font color="#f0f900">I had extreme fear of water.</font>

36:07.666 --> 36:11.387
<font color="#f0f900">Dear players, my sincere condolences.</font>

36:11.503 --> 36:14.677
<font color="#f0f900">You make a mistake again. And now the other rules:</font>

36:14.839 --> 36:20.096
<font color="#f0f900">after the death of three civilians there is the chance to uncover the mafia members.</font>

36:20.220 --> 36:24.771
<font color="#f0f900">I bring an extra vote. Players will have the opportunity</font>

36:24.933 --> 36:30.360
<font color="#f0f900">a Mafia member to out of the way. You have exactly six minutes.</font>

36:30.563 --> 36:33.612
<font color="#f0f900">Exactly why I love this kind of television show.</font>

36:33.817 --> 36:36.366
<font color="#f0f900">You never know what will happen.</font>

36:38.697 --> 36:43.453
<font color="#f0f900">Let us Iabern stop and send the neighbor to hell.</font>

36:44.703 --> 36:47.502
<font color="#f0f900">Walter, 45 years old.</font>

36:48.289 --> 36:52.544
<font color="#f0f900">Military officer. After several missions in war zones</font>

36:52.669 --> 36:56.219
<font color="#f0f900">has with him a posttraumatic stress disorder develops.</font>

37:00.969 --> 37:05.566
<font color="#f0f900">He applied to find out if he wants to live or not.</font>

37:05.724 --> 37:08.273
<font color="#f0f900">Him plaguing violent guilt over his failure.</font>

37:08.435 --> 37:13.441
<font color="#f0f900">A tactical mistake on his part has many young recruits killed.</font>

37:14.232 --> 37:17.327
<font color="#f0f900">He needs to take strong anti-depressants.</font>

37:17.485 --> 37:22.707
<font color="#f0f900">In sleep he lived through this tactical mistake again and again.</font>

37:33.543 --> 37:36.217
<font color="#f0f900">Walter, why do you speak of "victims"?</font>

37:37.130 --> 37:40.725
<font color="#f0f900">What do you think that? Or you might prefer child murderer?</font>

37:40.842 --> 37:44.016
<font color="#f0f900">I forgot to ask anyone what to call him.</font>

37:44.179 --> 37:48.184
<font color="#f0f900">I've already told you that I am completely innocent in the beginning.</font>

37:48.391 --> 37:52.487
<font color="#f0f900">Of course, of course. In our prisons sit innocent.</font>

37:52.604 --> 37:54.231
<font color="#f0f900">Why do you talk like that?</font>

37:55.440 --> 37:57.693
<font color="#f0f900">You know nothing about him.</font>

37:57.817 --> 38:01.572
<font color="#f0f900">Beat prefer before a candidate.</font>

38:05.909 --> 38:07.832
<font color="#f0f900">I know nothing about him?</font>

38:07.952 --> 38:12.628
<font color="#f0f900">The little girl was drunk and thereby has promoted two people to the afterlife.</font>

38:12.791 --> 38:15.260
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan was an ordinary student,</font>

38:15.418 --> 38:19.889
<font color="#f0f900">which was looking forward to the final exam, to begin his adult life.</font>

38:20.006 --> 38:22.429
<font color="#f0f900">After the official ceremony</font>

38:23.051 --> 38:25.725
<font color="#f0f900">He continues to celebrate with some friends.</font>

38:26.346 --> 38:29.441
<font color="#f0f900">Everything happened quickly.</font>

38:32.560 --> 38:35.279
<font color="#f0f900">Two classmates were killed.</font>

38:35.438 --> 38:38.942
<font color="#f0f900">And to have been about rescued by a woman's pleasure</font>

38:39.025 --> 38:42.655
<font color="#f0f900">was short-lived. The court issued its judgment very quickly.</font>

38:42.779 --> 38:47.626
<font color="#f0f900">And not for the benefit of Ivan, which was as it turned out, drove that night.</font>

38:51.496 --> 38:54.500
<font color="#f0f900">The jury acquitted him on all counts of the indictment guilty.</font>

38:54.707 --> 38:57.005
<font color="#f0f900">Guilty on all counts of the indictment.</font>

38:57.168 --> 38:59.921
<font color="#f0f900">Dual, premeditated murder.</font>

39:00.088 --> 39:03.638
<font color="#f0f900">Most fear Ivan has from dying in prison</font>

39:03.800 --> 39:05.643
<font color="#f0f900">and never to be free again.</font>

39:05.802 --> 39:08.851
<font color="#f0f900">At least it was not intentional, just like you.</font>

39:09.305 --> 39:13.606
<font color="#f0f900">Shut up, you HosenscheiÃŸer. - Laura, please forgive,</font>

39:13.893 --> 39:16.237
<font color="#f0f900">but your face looks familiar.</font>

39:16.479 --> 39:19.278
<font color="#f0f900">Are we ever met somewhere?</font>

39:19.440 --> 39:22.614
<font color="#f0f900">No, where? Of course not, dear.</font>

39:23.069 --> 39:26.664
<font color="#f0f900">Certainly not. I saw you on TV,</font>

39:26.948 --> 39:31.328
<font color="#f0f900">was transferred as the process. Was a great process, what?</font>

39:31.536 --> 39:34.289
<font color="#f0f900">Yes. - Are you ready now?</font>

39:34.789 --> 39:37.383
<font color="#f0f900">Or do you still show each other their birthmarks?</font>

39:37.959 --> 39:40.212
<font color="#f0f900">How about if we go, huh?</font>

39:40.712 --> 39:42.931
<font color="#f0f900">Why are you so rude?</font>

39:43.089 --> 39:45.342
<font color="#f0f900">I did not do anything to you.</font>

39:45.842 --> 39:49.392
<font color="#f0f900">What gnaws so? - You must not worry.</font>

39:50.388 --> 39:52.811
<font color="#f0f900">Think. Dear to the Mafia</font>

39:54.058 --> 39:56.277
<font color="#f0f900">I think you are in the mafia.</font>

40:00.648 --> 40:02.571
<font color="#f0f900">Oh yes? - Yes.</font>

40:03.860 --> 40:07.114
<font color="#f0f900">And I think that you are in the mafia.</font>

40:07.655 --> 40:11.501
<font color="#f0f900">Well, that's interesting. - Let's vote. - What?</font>

40:11.910 --> 40:15.505
<font color="#f0f900">May I remind you of the last vote?</font>

40:15.914 --> 40:18.292
<font color="#f0f900">I voted for Constantine</font>

40:18.541 --> 40:21.420
<font color="#f0f900">and he for Peter.</font>

40:21.753 --> 40:24.597
<font color="#f0f900">Listen to the one on!</font>

40:24.756 --> 40:28.852
<font color="#f0f900">Something like a stupid bitch wants a military officer</font>

40:28.968 --> 40:32.142
<font color="#f0f900">pose as the wicked? - That's enough now!</font>

40:32.639 --> 40:35.688
<font color="#f0f900">Can not you behave? I warn you, Walter.</font>

40:36.351 --> 40:39.355
<font color="#f0f900">You're never been at war, right? Coward.</font>

40:41.856 --> 40:44.200
<font color="#f0f900">I'm a coward? - Yes.</font>

40:45.693 --> 40:48.242
<font color="#f0f900">I was involved in eight appearances.</font>

40:48.446 --> 40:50.995
<font color="#f0f900">On the border with Mongolia</font>

40:51.449 --> 40:53.622
<font color="#f0f900">I was on fire,</font>

40:55.286 --> 41:02.261
<font color="#f0f900">while her here durftet celebrate the millennium of this country.</font>

41:05.088 --> 41:08.183
<font color="#f0f900">It is enough. Your gets on my nerves.</font>

41:09.384 --> 41:11.682
<font color="#f0f900">I agree...</font>

41:12.720 --> 41:15.690
<font color="#f0f900">for Laura. And?</font>

41:16.099 --> 41:17.897
<font color="#f0f900">Who is this?</font>

41:19.852 --> 41:23.573
<font color="#f0f900">A vote for Laura is registered.</font>

41:26.442 --> 41:28.991
<font color="#f0f900">I vote for Walter.</font>

41:39.872 --> 41:43.001
<font color="#f0f900">I'll give my voice Walter.</font>

41:47.422 --> 41:49.925
<font color="#f0f900">I opt for Walter.</font>

41:58.349 --> 42:00.772
<font color="#f0f900">Do you know what you are?</font>

42:02.145 --> 42:06.321
<font color="#f0f900">You are wretches! A pile sad, miserable wretches</font>

42:06.482 --> 42:11.113
<font color="#f0f900">full complexes. For example, this Luka.</font>

42:11.988 --> 42:15.788
<font color="#f0f900">One of Riley, who does not know what to do with the billions.</font>

42:16.159 --> 42:21.086
<font color="#f0f900">And he dragged himself here in order not to die lonely home.</font>

42:21.247 --> 42:26.504
<font color="#f0f900">And then this Ballerina and her mindless worshipers. As one comes even puke!</font>

42:26.711 --> 42:31.091
<font color="#f0f900">About you I have my opinion already made known.</font>

42:31.424 --> 42:34.303
<font color="#f0f900">A great team we've got, what?</font>

42:34.427 --> 42:37.852
<font color="#f0f900">An excellent general mean ye drummed up, people!</font>

42:39.807 --> 42:44.483
<font color="#f0f900">Five votes for Walter. This is the absolute majority.</font>

42:44.771 --> 42:47.274
<font color="#f0f900">That is, the decision is made.</font>

42:47.774 --> 42:49.993
<font color="#f0f900">Walter will leave us.</font>

42:50.109 --> 42:52.908
<font color="#f0f900">I do not understand that. Kieran and I have not been elected.</font>

42:53.071 --> 42:56.120
<font color="#f0f900">Walter is not in the Mafia. Definitely not. - Certainly?</font>

42:58.284 --> 43:01.458
<font color="#f0f900">Does it even matter?</font>

43:02.080 --> 43:05.801
<font color="#f0f900">Open your eyes. Have a look around times?</font>

43:06.542 --> 43:10.592
<font color="#f0f900">Corpses everywhere! Everything full of corpses around you!</font>

43:10.755 --> 43:13.554
<font color="#f0f900">We are even as good as dead!</font>

43:13.800 --> 43:15.894
<font color="#f0f900">Do not you understand?</font>

43:18.304 --> 43:21.399
<font color="#f0f900">I gave my word of honor as an officer.</font>

43:22.558 --> 43:25.858
<font color="#f0f900">Do you even know what that is?</font>

43:26.562 --> 43:29.156
<font color="#f0f900">An officer Very word?</font>

43:35.446 --> 43:38.450
<font color="#f0f900">Walter is a civilian.</font>

43:39.283 --> 43:41.832
<font color="#f0f900">Participants were wrong.</font>

43:41.994 --> 43:44.747
<font color="#f0f900">The Mafia is still among you.</font>

43:44.997 --> 43:47.671
<font color="#f0f900">The game continues.</font>

43:47.834 --> 43:50.132
<font color="#f0f900">Ride all to hell.</font>

44:19.574 --> 44:20.621
<font color="#f0f900">Falke!</font>

44:21.659 --> 44:24.879
<font color="#f0f900">Falke, number one here. Can you hear me?</font>

44:25.037 --> 44:27.381
<font color="#f0f900">Hawk is in position. - Let's go!</font>

44:45.266 --> 44:48.019
<font color="#f0f900">Be it on the hat, Hawk.</font>

44:48.102 --> 44:50.275
<font color="#f0f900">On the roof!</font>

44:52.273 --> 44:54.196
<font color="#f0f900">Take cover!</font>

45:09.415 --> 45:11.588
<font color="#f0f900">We first losses.</font>

45:34.774 --> 45:37.323
<font color="#f0f900">That's an ambush!</font>

45:59.423 --> 46:03.098
<font color="#f0f900">Here Hawk, we have defeated the enemy. We check out the situation. - Roger that.</font>

46:18.526 --> 46:20.620
<font color="#f0f900">Crap! What was that?</font>

46:36.627 --> 46:39.050
<font color="#f0f900">Crap! Hawk!</font>

47:56.999 --> 47:59.798
<font color="#f0f900">That's it, guys. I'm coming.</font>

48:15.434 --> 48:19.610
<font color="#f0f900">It's time to announce the night in our studio.</font>

48:19.814 --> 48:24.615
<font color="#f0f900">The city falls asleep. The Mafia wakes.</font>

48:32.952 --> 48:38.425
<font color="#f0f900">The Mafia replied. The choice is made.</font>

48:54.765 --> 48:58.736
<font color="#f0f900">Leaving us is: Laura.</font>

49:06.277 --> 49:08.371
<font color="#f0f900">Well then.</font>

49:10.281 --> 49:15.287
<font color="#f0f900">My fate is sealed. I get probably what I deserve.</font>

49:16.078 --> 49:21.130
<font color="#f0f900">Once Laura had everything: a house, a family, a good job.</font>

49:22.251 --> 49:25.004
<font color="#f0f900">But she has managed to lose everything.</font>

49:25.171 --> 49:28.471
<font color="#f0f900">First, a glass of wine in the evening to relax.</font>

49:28.632 --> 49:32.057
<font color="#f0f900">Later two, and then a glass of cognac.</font>

49:32.845 --> 49:38.102
<font color="#f0f900">When Laura admitted that she is an alcoholic, it was too late.</font>

49:39.268 --> 49:41.691
<font color="#f0f900">Her husband has long tried to help her.</font>

49:41.854 --> 49:46.280
<font color="#f0f900">But as for Laura drunk her son was killed, he left them.</font>

49:46.609 --> 49:49.488
<font color="#f0f900">Laura remained alone.</font>

49:49.695 --> 49:52.699
<font color="#f0f900">For suicide she lacked the courage.</font>

49:52.823 --> 49:56.703
<font color="#f0f900">It has strong fear of heights, acrophobia.</font>

49:57.036 --> 50:01.542
<font color="#f0f900">For more than eight years she had not left the house until they ...</font>

50:01.707 --> 50:03.709
<font color="#f0f900">Until I was one night on the road.</font>

50:04.001 --> 50:06.754
<font color="#f0f900">Excuse me, you said straight road?</font>

50:10.799 --> 50:13.177
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, John.</font>

50:15.179 --> 50:18.183
<font color="#f0f900">I must confess to you something before I die.</font>

50:19.058 --> 50:23.780
<font color="#f0f900">I hope you can forgive me. Had I known how everything develops,</font>

50:24.438 --> 50:27.282
<font color="#f0f900">I would not be running to the car.</font>

50:27.816 --> 50:30.569
<font color="#f0f900">Does that mean you have saved me?</font>

50:30.903 --> 50:34.828
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, saved ... and destroyed.</font>

50:34.990 --> 50:39.416
<font color="#f0f900">Still on the scene asked me the parents of Grisha for a favor.</font>

50:40.079 --> 50:42.707
<font color="#f0f900">Forgive me, Vanja, forgive me!</font>

50:43.916 --> 50:45.793
<font color="#f0f900">I bring only suffering.</font>

50:46.335 --> 50:53.560
<font color="#f0f900">Your Honour, I can say with certainty that derjunge man named Ivan</font>

50:53.759 --> 50:58.936
<font color="#f0f900">is to blame for this terrible accident. On the front passenger seat of the wrecked car</font>

50:59.098 --> 51:01.977
<font color="#f0f900">sat Grisha, seriously injured.</font>

51:02.101 --> 51:07.528
<font color="#f0f900">For this calamity he is in no way responsible. That's all.</font>

51:11.652 --> 51:15.327
<font color="#f0f900">Laura, you will certainly have acted,</font>

51:16.115 --> 51:20.621
<font color="#f0f900">because you had no choice, so I forgive you hereby.</font>

51:22.121 --> 51:24.249
<font color="#f0f900">Thank you my dear.</font>

51:28.627 --> 51:32.177
<font color="#f0f900">Laura is civilian.</font>

51:35.467 --> 51:38.016
<font color="#f0f900">I'm Ieid.</font>

51:39.263 --> 51:41.436
<font color="#f0f900">I hope you will win.</font>

52:02.786 --> 52:06.711
<font color="#f0f900">Dear passengers, we are approaching a Sch / real weather zone.</font>

52:06.832 --> 52:11.554
<font color="#f0f900">Please stay in their seats and fasten your seatbelt. I / any thanks.</font>

52:13.005 --> 52:15.099
<font color="#f0f900">So.</font>

52:15.633 --> 52:18.386
<font color="#f0f900">It starts.</font>

53:15.192 --> 53:17.911
<font color="#f0f900">Stay calm. Everything will be fine.</font>

54:14.585 --> 54:19.261
<font color="#f0f900">Such shocking confessions no longer existed in our show for a long time.</font>

54:19.423 --> 54:23.929
<font color="#f0f900">Thanks for turning. We continue to do everything possible to amaze.</font>

54:24.052 --> 54:28.683
<font color="#f0f900">We have only six participants. Look at these faces closely.</font>

54:28.807 --> 54:31.310
<font color="#f0f900">Two of them are cold-blooded killer,</font>

54:31.393 --> 54:35.864
<font color="#f0f900">the Laura have catapulted straight into this ill-fated aircraft.</font>

54:35.981 --> 54:40.361
<font color="#f0f900">Who are the two? Find it out, dear participants.</font>

54:40.486 --> 54:43.956
<font color="#f0f900">You have four minutes to vote.</font>

54:44.114 --> 54:47.459
<font color="#f0f900">So my intuition seems to have left me somehow.</font>

54:48.118 --> 54:50.917
<font color="#f0f900">There is only one, which I do not have suspected</font>

54:51.079 --> 54:54.208
<font color="#f0f900">namely me. - I think it's all of us.</font>

54:55.292 --> 54:58.091
<font color="#f0f900">Let us vote for Ivan.</font>

54:58.253 --> 55:00.631
<font color="#f0f900">You think he wanted to Laura's death?</font>

55:01.173 --> 55:05.644
<font color="#f0f900">I did not say that. I'm just saying, let's vote for Ivan.</font>

55:06.261 --> 55:10.983
<font color="#f0f900">And to remember something. Are not you afraid that sounds familiar.</font>

55:12.351 --> 55:14.854
<font color="#f0f900">Are you afraid of clashing ground.</font>

55:17.523 --> 55:20.367
<font color="#f0f900">But when they jump, everything will be fine.</font>

55:20.526 --> 55:23.826
<font color="#f0f900">When the light is a triangle,</font>

55:24.363 --> 55:27.617
<font color="#f0f900">You find the exit, and they may be saved.</font>

55:29.618 --> 55:32.497
<font color="#f0f900">With your prophecies confuse me.</font>

55:32.871 --> 55:35.090
<font color="#f0f900">I do not understand, Konstantin.</font>

55:35.249 --> 55:39.629
<font color="#f0f900">Think they really that Ivan has not forgiven her for her confession?</font>

55:39.795 --> 55:41.763
<font color="#f0f900">The fact that he has only played us?</font>

55:41.839 --> 55:46.561
<font color="#f0f900">That he knew from the beginning about Laura communication and wanted to get back at her?</font>

55:49.012 --> 55:52.937
<font color="#f0f900">You know what, Kieran? Something similar also walked me straight through the head.</font>

55:53.684 --> 55:55.686
<font color="#f0f900">But I ...</font>

55:57.020 --> 56:00.069
<font color="#f0f900">I think Ivan. He has not played for us.</font>

56:00.190 --> 56:03.444
<font color="#f0f900">Something I do not trust him. - Do we agree on.</font>

56:03.861 --> 56:06.580
<font color="#f0f900">Who is Ivan? - All the time you sit there like a mummy!</font>

56:06.697 --> 56:10.292
<font color="#f0f900">Now tell such stuff! Why should we believe you?</font>

56:10.617 --> 56:14.417
<font color="#f0f900">Konstantin has the most of the game said nothing rational.</font>

56:16.164 --> 56:20.010
<font color="#f0f900">I somehow feel that Kate and Kieran cooperate.</font>

56:22.546 --> 56:24.924
<font color="#f0f900">Have you perhaps taken before the game?</font>

56:25.299 --> 56:29.099
<font color="#f0f900">Do not let them distract you! At the moment the most important thing to vote for Ivan.</font>

56:29.261 --> 56:33.516
<font color="#f0f900">And I say: my intuition is back and whispers the name of Constantinople.</font>

56:34.308 --> 56:38.688
<font color="#f0f900">My intuition says otherwise. I vote for EII.</font>

56:39.146 --> 56:42.320
<font color="#f0f900">Anyway, we have to vote at last. Who is Ivan?</font>

56:53.619 --> 56:56.998
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan, I do not, because you suspect me.</font>

56:57.122 --> 57:01.343
<font color="#f0f900">I just play with. It hints at a draw. That gave's never.</font>

57:01.919 --> 57:04.923
<font color="#f0f900">I also agree for Konstantin.</font>

57:10.302 --> 57:13.397
<font color="#f0f900">Me too.</font>

57:14.056 --> 57:16.650
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan, raise your hand.</font>

57:17.476 --> 57:19.899
<font color="#f0f900">I vote for EII.</font>

57:21.772 --> 57:26.744
<font color="#f0f900">Three votes for Ivan, two of Constantine, one for EII.</font>

57:26.944 --> 57:29.367
<font color="#f0f900">According to the rules of the game, the player who is to retire must,</font>

57:29.488 --> 57:32.492
<font color="#f0f900">obtain the absolute majority of votes.</font>

57:32.658 --> 57:36.583
<font color="#f0f900">In this case, four. That concludes the vote is repeated.</font>

57:36.703 --> 57:41.334
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan, EII, and Constantine. The others are not considered this time.</font>

57:41.500 --> 57:44.754
<font color="#f0f900">Hurry up, this time you have only two minutes.</font>

57:45.128 --> 57:50.885
<font color="#f0f900">I think Ivan. I do not want that something happens to him. I do not agree for him.</font>

57:51.468 --> 57:54.438
<font color="#f0f900">I vote for Konstantin.</font>

57:54.721 --> 57:57.816
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, you're stronger than you think.</font>

57:57.933 --> 58:01.062
<font color="#f0f900">I also agree for Konstantin.</font>

58:02.437 --> 58:04.735
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan!</font>

58:06.441 --> 58:10.992
<font color="#f0f900">I do not change my decision also. I trust Constantine. That's the way it is.</font>

58:12.280 --> 58:15.454
<font color="#f0f900">I make it a little dramatic. I choose Konstantin.</font>

58:21.331 --> 58:24.301
<font color="#f0f900">Three votes are not enough. Los, yet.</font>

58:25.419 --> 58:29.299
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan, what's wrong with you? Raise your hand.</font>

58:29.464 --> 58:32.934
<font color="#f0f900">What should be? I just do not think that Constantine belongs to the Mafia.</font>

58:33.051 --> 58:36.271
<font color="#f0f900">I choose EII.</font>

58:42.853 --> 58:46.073
<font color="#f0f900">I vote for Konstantin.</font>

59:05.000 --> 59:08.504
<font color="#f0f900">Is the? Can a player for simply vote for yourself?</font>

59:08.920 --> 59:13.551
<font color="#f0f900">I think that would be the first time in history. Right, Mr. Moderator?</font>

59:13.717 --> 59:19.065
<font color="#f0f900">Absolutely right. - That we have not so agreed.</font>

59:20.265 --> 59:22.438
<font color="#f0f900">Is he in the Mafia?</font>

59:29.816 --> 59:33.366
<font color="#f0f900">Konstantin belongs to the Mafia.</font>

59:42.621 --> 59:44.373
<font color="#f0f900">It's over.</font>

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:11.154
<font color="#f0f900">What is this, Grandpa? I'm in a hurry.</font>

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.905
<font color="#f0f900">Why do you say Grandpa to me, kid?</font>

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.580
<font color="#f0f900">Finally done.</font>

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:50.921
<font color="#f0f900">AII my Vorhersehungen have come true. I cheated on you.</font>

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:55.129
<font color="#f0f900">I have changed the gameplay. Now they can defeat you.</font>

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.257
<font color="#f0f900">Then it's over to the mafia show.</font>

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:04.100
<font color="#f0f900">to die as an old man,</font>

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:09.484
<font color="#f0f900">this is the most beautiful of all deaths.</font>

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.740
<font color="#f0f900">Gone.</font>

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:40.925
<font color="#f0f900">We will see who will change the flow of the game.</font>

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:51.611
<font color="#f0f900">The city goes to sleep again. And the Mafia wakes.</font>

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.368
<font color="#f0f900">Welcome back to Mafia show.</font>

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:10.209
<font color="#f0f900">Playing with the risk of dying. The game that changed her mind.</font>

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:16.461
<font color="#f0f900">It can be requested at the time, who has not awakened this morning.</font>

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:21.181
<font color="#f0f900">It is ... Ivan.</font>

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.266
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan.</font>

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.487
<font color="#f0f900">That can not be true.</font>

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.365
<font color="#f0f900">How so?</font>

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:46.745
<font color="#f0f900">Why Ivan? - That's not profitable.</font>

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:06.177
<font color="#f0f900">Ivan is a civilian.</font>

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.363
<font color="#f0f900">That's so sad. - Do not cry, it's okay.</font>

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:23.611
<font color="#f0f900">In this show I've achieved a lot.</font>

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.113
<font color="#f0f900">Now all know that I am innocent.</font>

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:35.836
<font color="#f0f900">Yeah, right, I admit that I was hoping for a new life in freedom.</font>

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.090
<font color="#f0f900">I'm only 18th</font>

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:45.007
<font color="#f0f900">But I knew the rules.</font>

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.345
<font color="#f0f900">Tut mir Ieid, Mama.</font>

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.228
<font color="#f0f900">I've never been with her at sea.</font>

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.281
<font color="#f0f900">Mummy, Mummy Dearest ...</font>

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.535
<font color="#f0f900">Hold on!</font>

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:11.075
<font color="#f0f900">I really love you very much. Please forgive me.</font>

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.463
<font color="#f0f900">I was not a good son.</font>

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.254
<font color="#f0f900">Mama.</font>

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:20.192
<font color="#f0f900">Forgive me, Mama.</font>

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:40.839
<font color="#f0f900">I welcome our great quartet!</font>

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.999
<font color="#f0f900">Among them, three civilians</font>

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:47.797
<font color="#f0f900">the need to join forces to unmask the last Mafia member.</font>

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:51.342
<font color="#f0f900">But the mafia is smart and stronger than ever.</font>

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:55.058
<font color="#f0f900">If they manage to run the game until the final duel?</font>

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.815
<font color="#f0f900">We learn in two minutes. The time is running.</font>

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:04.234
<font color="#f0f900">That is then probably, if we do not expose him, then we are just the three!</font>

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:09.531
<font color="#f0f900">And the Mafia kills even one of us! - Now you need three votes.</font>

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.575
<font color="#f0f900">That is, we must be unanimous. With whom do we start?</font>

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:16.287
<font color="#f0f900">Do you know the term "fishing with yourself to"? EII,</font>

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.248
<font color="#f0f900">You might belong to the Mafia?</font>

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.413
<font color="#f0f900">It's always the same.</font>

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:24.841
<font color="#f0f900">As long as you do not say anything, all is well, but if they do, you belong to the Mafia.</font>

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:28.588
<font color="#f0f900">Come on, EII, whom do you suggest? - No idea.</font>

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:32.553
<font color="#f0f900">They are a nice couple, you and Kate.</font>

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:37.513
<font color="#f0f900">Why do you think we're a couple?</font>

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:39.477
<font color="#f0f900">I think so long.</font>

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:44.444
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran is a hopeless polemicist. Even the game he came that way.</font>

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.152
<font color="#f0f900">One of his friends has doubts that Kieran has the courage</font>

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.783
<font color="#f0f900">submit the entry form for the mafia show.</font>

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:52.034
<font color="#f0f900">You are mistaken.</font>

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:57.495
<font color="#f0f900">And indeed he had met the day before the game Kate. By chance!</font>

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.285
<font color="#f0f900">Without the whole truth about the new acquaintance to know</font>

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:03.671
<font color="#f0f900">Kate had revealed to him all her fears:</font>

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.504
<font color="#f0f900">front height, snakes, desert.</font>

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.839
<font color="#f0f900">Kate grew up in the orphanage.</font>

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.305
<font color="#f0f900">For this reason she thinks that nobody will protect in this world.</font>

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:15.387
<font color="#f0f900">Neither Kieran even Kate knew</font>

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.019
<font color="#f0f900">that they meet again the next day in Mafia Studio,</font>

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:22.140
<font color="#f0f900">where they will learn what they're really scared.</font>

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.018
<font color="#f0f900">So I then surely located properly.</font>

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.069
<font color="#f0f900">But I do not think that you are in collusion.</font>

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:33.068
<font color="#f0f900">Exactly. We have only met us yesterday.</font>

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.238
<font color="#f0f900">That's the truth.</font>

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.241
<font color="#f0f900">We had no idea that we meet again here.</font>

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:43.124
<font color="#f0f900">That's the way it is. I still have not recovered from this surprise.</font>

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.831
<font color="#f0f900">Yesterday we lost not a word about the game.</font>

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:51.094
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran, you are really sure that Kate does not belong to the Mafia?</font>

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:56.433
<font color="#f0f900">Yes for sure. - And you, Kate? Dare Kieran?</font>

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.968
<font color="#f0f900">Yes I do.</font>

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:03.356
<font color="#f0f900">EII, it looks as if one of us next. - Why then?</font>

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:09.196
<font color="#f0f900">They seem to work together. You decide who goes next.</font>

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.821
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran and I are not trying to protect us.</font>

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.987
<font color="#f0f900">We just want to survive as you all! - We have no time.</font>

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:21.366
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, come on, you now have to decide.</font>

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.710
<font color="#f0f900">Oh no, I do not.</font>

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:28.590
<font color="#f0f900">I do not belong to the mafia and will also anyone Henkerin here are.</font>

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:33.131
<font color="#f0f900">Dear participants, they have only ten seconds to decide.</font>

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.631
<font color="#f0f900">Hurry up please. - Kate, how you choose?</font>

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:40.018
<font color="#f0f900">I do not know how to decide. I'm confused.</font>

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.804
<font color="#f0f900">I do not know what to do.</font>

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.439
<font color="#f0f900">Participants could not decide.</font>

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:51.108
<font color="#f0f900">This means the game will do it themselves.</font>

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:54.733
<font color="#f0f900">The computer will choose who must rely.</font>

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:58.571
<font color="#f0f900">It can happen to anyone, a civilian, or the last Mafia member.</font>

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:02.325
<font color="#f0f900">Who will have better luck? Ten seconds,</font>

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.619
<font color="#f0f900">nine, eight, seven,</font>

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.255
<font color="#f0f900">six, five, four,</font>

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:12.629
<font color="#f0f900">three two one.</font>

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.636
<font color="#f0f900">The choice falls on Kate.</font>

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.969
<font color="#f0f900">No! - So a finals also do not like.</font>

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:22.636
<font color="#f0f900">What are you talking about? They wanted to create in the next round it yet.</font>

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.854
<font color="#f0f900">That you have now. Maybe we still win.</font>

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:32.355
<font color="#f0f900">Kate is one of the civilians.</font>

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:36.942
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran, you forgive me?</font>

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:40.615
<font color="#f0f900">Fate has willed it so.</font>

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.578
<font color="#f0f900">That's ... so it must be.</font>

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.497
<font color="#f0f900">That's why I came here.</font>

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:55.801
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, why are you here?</font>

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.007
<font color="#f0f900">What are you talking?</font>

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:05.686
<font color="#f0f900">What are you doing there? Kieran, stop it.</font>

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.774
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, I'm coming with you.</font>

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:17.824
<font color="#f0f900">This is really very interesting.</font>

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:22.579
<font color="#f0f900">So something has never been offered in this show.</font>

01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:00.366
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, that's just your fear. I can save you!</font>

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.160
<font color="#f0f900">You can not look down, do not forget how that works here.</font>

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:37.771
<font color="#f0f900">We have to jump from this board if we are to live. Trust me.</font>

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.865
<font color="#f0f900">Do you understand? - Yes, but I jump in any case.</font>

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.492
<font color="#f0f900">I'll help you.</font>

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.620
<font color="#f0f900">You have to get up carefully now.</font>

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:59.797
<font color="#f0f900">Okay, on three. One two...</font>

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.375
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, are you okay?</font>

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.008
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, I'm just a little confused.</font>

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.882
<font color="#f0f900">Where are we?</font>

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.885
<font color="#f0f900">Do you have any idea?</font>

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:54.685
<font color="#f0f900">Crap. We need to quickly get out of here.</font>

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.526
<font color="#f0f900">And where? What do you think? - The light in the triangle in front there ...</font>

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:04.487
<font color="#f0f900">What? Just as Constantine said it.</font>

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.198
<font color="#f0f900">How is that possible?</font>

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.411
<font color="#f0f900">By spring he was right.</font>

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:17.454
<font color="#f0f900">Did you also feel that we are expected here long? - Kate.</font>

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.333
<font color="#f0f900">We will now go to the light.</font>

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.532
<font color="#f0f900">What are those noises?</font>

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.953
<font color="#f0f900">I have no Idea.</font>

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:06.881
<font color="#f0f900">Attention!</font>

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.894
<font color="#f0f900">Da lang.</font>

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.114
<font color="#f0f900">What's this?</font>

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.913
<font color="#f0f900">Not only are your fears.</font>

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:45.792
<font color="#f0f900">What's this?</font>

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.220
<font color="#f0f900">What are you afraid of?</font>

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.311
<font color="#f0f900">losing you.</font>

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.310
<font color="#f0f900">Hide yourself.</font>

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:03.564
<font color="#f0f900">Hide yourself!</font>

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.072
<font color="#f0f900">Kieran! The light! He's afraid of the light!</font>

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:53.233
<font color="#f0f900">Where are we? - This place is very familiar to me.</font>

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.326
<font color="#f0f900">This is my orphanage.</font>

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.366
<font color="#f0f900">Why are we here?</font>

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:12.915
<font color="#f0f900">Are you that?</font>

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:17.341
<font color="#f0f900">You know, I always dreamed of, to learn who my parents were.</font>

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.971
<font color="#f0f900">About how I was born.</font>

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:29.561
<font color="#f0f900">But I was also very afraid to know why they left me.</font>

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:38.028
<font color="#f0f900">That is why we are so here. That's here, what are you afraid most.</font>

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:47.834
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, but understand what we see here, nothing has with reality,</font>

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:50.711
<font color="#f0f900">the future or the past to do.</font>

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.214
<font color="#f0f900">You have to solve yourself from your ideas.</font>

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:56.543
<font color="#f0f900">I live for so many years so that, so I went to the game.</font>

01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:02.640
<font color="#f0f900">Kate, you have to understand that this is not showing your real past here</font>

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:08.054
<font color="#f0f900">but the past, before you fear you. You have to change.</font>

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.350
<font color="#f0f900">Just imagine how your parents were there for you and had thee.</font>

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:16.820
<font color="#f0f900">And that something intervened,</font>

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:22.777
<font color="#f0f900">which has brought apart you. Do you try it? - I'll try it.</font>

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:25.537
<font color="#f0f900">You can do it.</font>

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:52.852
<font color="#f0f900">Dear viewers, according to the rules of the show,</font>

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:57.065
<font color="#f0f900">, when only a civilian and a Mafia member remain,</font>

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:01.983
<font color="#f0f900">all prize money automatically paid to the Mafia member.</font>

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:07.280
<font color="#f0f900">And who is part of the mafia, we will know after the advertisement.</font>

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:10.499
<font color="#f0f900">See you soon, in the next round!</font>

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.912
<font color="#f0f900">The madness.</font>

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:23.967
<font color="#f0f900">When I learned of your acquaintance,</font>

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.809
<font color="#f0f900">I could not imagine that the whole thing would develop so me.</font>

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.353
<font color="#f0f900">But Konstantin assured me from the beginning,</font>

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.100
<font color="#f0f900">that ye may be a pair of increase quotas.</font>

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:39.152
<font color="#f0f900">Then Constantine was in the Mafia? - Exactly.</font>

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:43.066
<font color="#f0f900">But many more. He was one of my best editors.</font>

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:46.406
<font color="#f0f900">With your help, he wanted to destroy the game,</font>

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:51.199
<font color="#f0f900">but could not really understand how the game works exactly.</font>

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:58.123
<font color="#f0f900">At that moment you find yourself still in the created world from me.</font>

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.182
<font color="#f0f900">That's impossible.</font>

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.469
<font color="#f0f900">As...? We are still in there?</font>

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:15.560
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, although currently no one but us, the game looks. Funny, is not it?</font>

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:19.185
<font color="#f0f900">Mafia. This is my life's work.</font>

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:24.232
<font color="#f0f900">I'll never give it up. The odds have failed catastrophically.</font>

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:28.407
<font color="#f0f900">The people began to get bored on death on television.</font>

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.823
<font color="#f0f900">So I had to change something. - Wait a moment.</font>

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:36.707
<font color="#f0f900">That's why you have decided to show our love?</font>

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.588
<font color="#f0f900">Therefore Kieran has its place can leave as easy, right?</font>

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:43.796
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, I have instructed the technicians to reprogram its place.</font>

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:48.597
<font color="#f0f900">Good idea, right? - Katja and I have therefore controlled the game!</font>

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.759
<font color="#f0f900">The only one who controls something here I am.</font>

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:57.265
<font color="#f0f900">The game is connected to my consciousness.</font>

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:02.149
<font color="#f0f900">Is not that awesome? So I created a finale,</font>

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:05.941
<font color="#f0f900">the viewers have never seen before.</font>

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:14.452
<font color="#f0f900">This reality is controlled by me, them shall ye never forget her.</font>

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:19.746
<font color="#f0f900">And please do not force me to regret that I have both left you alive.</font>

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:23.917
<font color="#f0f900">Good luck. We'll see you back in the game.</font>

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:41.938
<font color="#f0f900">It is important that we are alive and together, Kate.</font>

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:49.275
<font color="#f0f900">Yes, but when the show is over, and we</font>

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:53.366
<font color="#f0f900">again are in reality, who was then the second Mafia member?</font>

01:24:02.496 --> 01:24:06.251
<font color="#f0f900">Papa! Papa!</font>

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.345
<font color="#f0f900">Hi, how are you?</font>

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:14.266
<font color="#f0f900">Let Mama go, come on.</font>

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.732
<font color="#f0f900">Hello.</font>

01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:27.192
<font color="#f0f900">Forgive me, my dear.</font>

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:31.321
<font color="#f0f900">I just wanted you lack nothing.</font>

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:37.326
<font color="#f0f900">I have won.</font>

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:45.502
<font color="#f0f900">You were the Mafia Member?</font>

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:57.639
<font color="#f0f900">That's fine.</font>

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:02.064
<font color="#f0f900">The important thing is that you finally are back with us.</font>

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:09.196
<font color="#f0f900">And will you stay. No money in the world</font>

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:13.442
<font color="#f0f900">can replace yourself to me, my darling.</font>

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:22.206
<font color="#f0f900">EII lived ten months instead of the three that have been diagnosed him.</font>

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.792
<font color="#f0f900">Luka was lucky.</font>

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:29.959
<font color="#f0f900">He was allowed to leave the game unscathed, albeit without winning.</font>

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.212
<font color="#f0f900">Luka has decided to disinherit his grandchildren</font>

01:25:33.337 --> 01:25:37.934
<font color="#f0f900">and his entire fortune to leave the orphanage, where I grew up.</font>

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:43.018
<font color="#f0f900">The Mother of Ivan gets flowers every day in memory of her son.</font>

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:52.106
<font color="#f0f900">You know what, Kieran, actually Konstantin has proved real hero.</font>

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:56.239
<font color="#f0f900">He has changed the game play, so that we could put an end to evil.</font>

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:00.572
<font color="#f0f900">But we lost.</font>

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.294
<font color="#f0f900">No, Kate.</font>

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:08.125
<font color="#f0f900">It is far from over.</font>

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.671
<font color="#f0f900">The game in which there is hardly any chance of winning.</font>

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.224
<font color="#f0f900">But if evil is not punished,</font>

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:23.770
<font color="#f0f900">there is always one who challenges the system.</font>

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:27.650
<font color="#f0f900">One who believes in the truth and its ideals.</font>

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:31.441
<font color="#f0f900">One who is willing to fight to the end.</font>

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:35.941
<font color="#f0f900">Because if the city falls asleep,</font>

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.494
<font color="#f0f900">awakens the Mafia.</font>
