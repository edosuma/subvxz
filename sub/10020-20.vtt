WEBVTT

00:03.833 --> 00:06.719
ER

00:06.820 --> 00:07.990
Previously on ER...

00:07.991 --> 00:09.771
We do not need
a Pediatric Attending here.

00:09.806 --> 00:11.602
Don't worry. It won't happen.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.422
...think I have what it takes to be
an Attending?

00:13.423 --> 00:14.761
Of course you do.

00:14.762 --> 00:16.891
- You've been a great friend.
- But?

00:17.309 --> 00:19.167
But there's this other guy.

00:19.468 --> 00:24.267
Both adults... we enjoy each other...
Why not?

00:25.248 --> 00:28.075
None of you wants the family
involved in your lives.

00:28.076 --> 00:31.117
- He's not gonna break my heart!
- Men like him don't change!

00:31.118 --> 00:35.062
- Start an epinephrine drip.
- And a heart transplant too?

00:36.058 --> 00:37.507
Pizza?

00:38.012 --> 00:40.809
"Past Regret And Future Fear"

00:47.231 --> 00:50.522
Sleeping Beauty awakes.

00:50.732 --> 00:53.223
Hey. I was just checking my messages.

00:53.443 --> 00:56.894
You didn't even stir when the alarm
went off. Dead to the world.

00:57.114 --> 01:00.196
It's not that often that
I get a chance to sleep in.

01:00.407 --> 01:03.360
Don't rub it in.
Some of us have to work Sundays.

01:03.577 --> 01:05.948
Oh, please.
You know I've had my share.

01:06.454 --> 01:09.868
Well, you're welcome to stay.
No reason to waste a warm bed.

01:10.082 --> 01:13.082
No, no, no.
Actually, I need to get going.

01:13.292 --> 01:16.079
There's tea and toast.
You'll have to boil the kettle.

01:16.253 --> 01:18.079
But I think you can manage that.

01:18.338 --> 01:19.368
No.

01:19.672 --> 01:22.293
I've gotta go somewhere.

01:22.674 --> 01:25.960
Not some other clandestine meeting,
I hope.

01:27.679 --> 01:29.671
Reece is getting baptized today.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.680
Protestant or Catholic?

01:31.974 --> 01:33.766
- Why?
- Just curious.

01:33.933 --> 01:35.178
AME.

01:36.019 --> 01:37.299
I would've invited you-

01:37.520 --> 01:40.141
It's a family thing.
You have time to go and change?

01:40.355 --> 01:43.605
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, have a good time then.

01:43.775 --> 01:45.732
Could you lock the door
on your way out?

01:45.943 --> 01:47.900
- Sure.
- Great.

01:50.531 --> 01:51.941
Hey, Peter.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.821
It was really lovely last night.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.577
- What are you doing?
- I'm hungry.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.532
- You can't start without her.
- Why not?

02:02.957 --> 02:05.115
I knew this brunch was a bad idea.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.789
- She's a little late.
- We should've met on neutral territory.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.874
I told you that deep down,
your mother likes me.

02:13.090 --> 02:14.963
Keep dreaming.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.172
- Finally.
- There you go.

02:20.345 --> 02:21.376
Hi.

02:21.597 --> 02:24.846
Hello. What happened
to your front step?

02:26.225 --> 02:28.798
Did you get a flat tire?
Why are you late?

02:28.978 --> 02:31.219
Javier, this is my daughter Carol.

02:31.438 --> 02:33.679
- And her friend Doug.
- Nice to meet you.

02:33.898 --> 02:36.306
Sorry we're late. I couldn't
get your mother out of the house.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.181
Excuse me?

02:38.402 --> 02:41.817
You know how she is. Has to
be perfect. Allow me, sweet pea.

02:42.030 --> 02:44.188
I'll get this.
Can I get you guys a drink?

02:44.406 --> 02:45.948
- You have orange juice?
- Yes.

02:46.158 --> 02:49.112
- Two mimosas, please.
- You brought champagne.

02:49.327 --> 02:50.525
Aren't we celebrating?

02:50.912 --> 02:52.906
Two happy couples, right?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.929 --> 03:52.922
Did you see how
he kept touching her back?

03:53.138 --> 03:54.514
I wasn't paying attention.

03:54.682 --> 03:58.014
- You were busy laughing at his jokes.
- He was funny.

03:58.185 --> 04:01.519
And "sweet pea"? If he called her
that again, I was gonna barf.

04:01.729 --> 04:04.480
- I thought it was great.
- They met at the racetrack.

04:04.689 --> 04:06.813
Now, that was a senior citizen outing.

04:07.025 --> 04:09.183
So? They let anybody in those groups.

04:09.402 --> 04:10.944
Now, that's not true.

04:11.571 --> 04:15.187
This is the nicest your mother's ever
been. I want to keep it that way.

04:15.365 --> 04:17.522
You don't understand.
My mother hates men.

04:17.699 --> 04:20.190
- "Hate" is a strong word.
- But accurate.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.079
- Maybe she's getting some.
- Don't even go there!

04:23.287 --> 04:24.947
- How was it?
- In like Flint.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.657
- I got it.
- You look like hell.

04:26.873 --> 04:30.040
You gotta love Saturday nights.
ICU's packed.

04:30.211 --> 04:33.328
Two muggings, three bar fights,
four gangbanger drop-offs...

04:33.546 --> 04:36.296
...and a bad stroganoff
from a wedding reception.

04:36.505 --> 04:39.078
And the guy who licked
his girlfriend's shoe.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.960
- Why's that?
- She asked him to.

04:41.177 --> 04:44.461
- Had to do a tongue culture.
- On that note, anybody hungry?

04:44.679 --> 04:47.004
No. Anna actually brought
Sunday doughnuts.

04:47.223 --> 04:49.179
Cake isn't enough?
You have to deep-fry it?

04:49.391 --> 04:50.766
That's the point.

04:50.975 --> 04:52.720
- How long you on?
- Twenty minutes.

04:52.936 --> 04:55.557
Medevac is incoming.
Twenty-nine-year-old.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.721
Chemical accident.
Bad chemical burn.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.053
Terrific.

04:59.858 --> 05:01.482
Hold the elevator.

05:01.651 --> 05:02.682
Going down?

05:02.901 --> 05:04.064
Up, actually.

05:04.278 --> 05:05.392
Up's fine.

05:06.404 --> 05:09.108
I'm surprised to see you
here on a Sunday.

05:09.323 --> 05:12.074
Well, I'm just full of surprises.
Covering the ER?

05:12.659 --> 05:14.568
You've signed up
for a lot of extra coverage.

05:14.743 --> 05:16.202
You know, idle hands...

05:16.412 --> 05:20.243
Lizzie, I think it's time
you and I had a little sit-down.

05:21.208 --> 05:24.208
- Is there a problem?
- No problem. Let me buy you lunch.

05:24.419 --> 05:27.786
- Is it about the HemoAid study?
- That and the future.

05:28.547 --> 05:31.583
- All right.
- Good. Then in about an hour?

05:38.763 --> 05:41.170
- You said hydrofluoric acid?
- Yeah!

05:41.390 --> 05:44.141
- Not hydrochloric?
- I don't think so. Why?

05:44.350 --> 05:46.592
- It's that-
- I heard we had a burn victim.

05:46.852 --> 05:49.093
- Actually, chemical burn!
- How bad?

05:49.645 --> 05:53.179
- What do you got?
- Canterna, 31-year-old security guard.

05:53.399 --> 05:56.517
Chemical burns to the trunk,
right arm and both legs.

05:56.735 --> 05:59.355
- Doused with hydrofluoric acid.
- What happened?

05:59.570 --> 06:01.646
The vat was leaking.
I tightened the valve.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.322
Just lie back and relax.

06:03.699 --> 06:05.358
I tried to rinse it off.

06:05.575 --> 06:08.244
I gave him 5 of morphine,
2 liters normal saline.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.911
You feeling any more pain?

06:10.121 --> 06:12.195
- It's okay now.
- All right, let's move him.

06:22.797 --> 06:23.959
Good morning.

06:26.340 --> 06:29.127
Usually improvement occurs
within the first months.

06:29.343 --> 06:31.466
He's still working
on his motor skills.

06:31.637 --> 06:33.462
Chase's progress has
slowed considerably.

06:33.638 --> 06:35.879
All the more reason
for aggressive therapy.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.213
He can get that at home.

06:37.641 --> 06:39.717
I want what's medically best
for my cousin.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.602
I think this is a big mistake.

06:42.812 --> 06:45.682
John, it's often wise
to listen to the perspective...

06:45.898 --> 06:48.103
...of those not personally involved.

06:48.316 --> 06:52.016
Chase is getting worse. He's lost
all function on his left side.

06:53.028 --> 06:56.313
He just favors his right.
You have to force him to use his left.

06:56.656 --> 06:58.399
I wish it were that simple.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.658
It is. Watch.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.653
John, please.

07:03.327 --> 07:04.655
Hey, Chase.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.319
How you doing?

07:07.538 --> 07:10.742
How you doing? You want to draw?

07:11.669 --> 07:15.285
He was left-handed. He was drawing
last week. Want to draw something?

07:15.545 --> 07:17.004
This isn't necessary.

07:17.588 --> 07:18.668
Okay?

07:19.423 --> 07:21.001
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.332
Go ahead and you take the pencil.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.676
No, no. Other hand.

07:29.598 --> 07:31.969
Come on. He can do this.

07:32.350 --> 07:34.426
It's okay. It's okay.
There you go.

07:35.060 --> 07:38.061
Now you're all set.
What do you want to draw?

07:39.690 --> 07:42.559
- You.
- You want to draw me? Okay, go ahead.

07:44.109 --> 07:45.141
I rushed him.

07:47.195 --> 07:50.314
I rushed him. Can't rush him.
All right?

07:50.531 --> 07:52.653
There you go. Let's try again.

07:55.702 --> 07:59.236
He needs calcium chloride,
10% solution. Start with 5 amps.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.444
Five amps?

08:00.663 --> 08:03.829
Then set up an infusion.
One gram every 15 minutes.

08:04.042 --> 08:06.662
So, Mr. Canterna,
feeling any more pain?

08:06.877 --> 08:08.786
It's getting numb. Is that bad?

08:09.003 --> 08:11.329
Our immediate concern is
the fluoride in the acid.

08:11.547 --> 08:13.041
Like toothpaste?

08:13.256 --> 08:17.301
Not exactly. The calcium can
be drawn out of your cells.

08:17.510 --> 08:18.884
What does that mean?

08:19.053 --> 08:22.089
Well, it depends how much
has penetrated your skin.

08:22.306 --> 08:26.468
We're giving you calcium intravenously
to counteract the effect.

08:26.684 --> 08:30.183
- Is there any family you want to call?
- What are you not telling me?

08:30.394 --> 08:32.720
Hydrofluoric burns can be serious.

08:32.897 --> 08:35.138
Is there any family
you'd like us to call?

08:35.357 --> 08:37.395
No, I don't really
have family in Chicago.

08:37.609 --> 08:40.525
Okay, I'll be right back. Carol?

08:40.818 --> 08:45.112
Keep an eye on him. Make sure he's
comfortable and watch his heart rhythm.

08:45.323 --> 08:49.071
- Tell me if his leg gets worse.
- It's not his leg I'm worried about.

08:55.331 --> 08:57.903
- You look nice.
- Thanks. Hey, is Carla here yet?

08:58.083 --> 08:59.113
Inside.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.827
Hey, Uncle Peter.

09:01.337 --> 09:02.581
Where is she?

09:03.046 --> 09:04.954
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.543
- Steven!
- You said he had a new girlfriend.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.128
Well, I don't.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.714
Dad said Grandma was
turning over in her grave.

09:12.929 --> 09:15.632
That's enough.
Go in there and get a seat.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.017
Oh, come on.

09:23.769 --> 09:26.437
- You remember Roger.
- How are you doing, man?

09:28.356 --> 09:30.148
Carla, can I talk
to you for a minute?

09:30.358 --> 09:31.768
- All set?
- Yes.

09:31.984 --> 09:35.317
We should do a little rehearsal
before everyone arrives.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.322
Mom and Dad-

09:37.530 --> 09:38.810
I'm the father.

09:39.031 --> 09:42.364
- I'm sorry. Who's holding the baby?
- I am.

09:42.576 --> 09:45.778
Can we just step back here?
Yeah, come on.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.705
Everybody move around
and make way. Thank you.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.657
No, no, no.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.248
That's good. That's good.

09:55.085 --> 09:56.994
Here you go, little pickle.

09:57.296 --> 10:00.877
Mom in the middle.
Dad right here on the end.

10:01.090 --> 10:04.423
Right here. That's good there.
Thank you. Okay.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.634
I wasn't even supposed
to go into work today.

10:07.803 --> 10:11.006
I was home restoring my car
and the weekend guy called in sick.

10:11.598 --> 10:13.637
I figured I could use the overtime.

10:13.809 --> 10:16.809
- What kind of car do you have?
- She's a '63 Vette.

10:16.978 --> 10:20.227
She's a nice one.
And she's got matching numbers.

10:20.438 --> 10:22.015
I'll fix her up. She'll be worth-

10:24.441 --> 10:26.184
It's hurting under my skin.

10:26.401 --> 10:28.809
I'll give you something more
for the pain.

10:30.404 --> 10:33.440
- How long will this hang me up for?
- It's hard to say.

10:38.035 --> 10:41.239
He's already severely hypocalcemic
and the leg is necrotic.

10:41.454 --> 10:42.652
Any EKG changes?

10:42.831 --> 10:45.500
Prolonged QT.
He's at risk for an arrhythmia.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.326
What does Toxicology say?

10:47.501 --> 10:50.206
Hydrofluoric burns of this magnitude
are always fatal.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.701
There's no new treatment.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.337
- His family on the way?
- He doesn't have any in town.

10:55.507 --> 10:58.342
You might have time
to fly somebody in.

10:59.468 --> 11:01.211
I guess I'd better go tell him.

11:05.056 --> 11:06.764
This is really starting to hurt.

11:06.975 --> 11:09.382
We can do something about that.
Another 5 of morphine.

11:09.601 --> 11:11.972
Are you okay?
You don't look so good yourself.

11:12.187 --> 11:14.428
Mr. Canterna,
the calcium we're giving you...

11:14.648 --> 11:17.931
...can't reverse
the chemical reaction in your body.

11:18.191 --> 11:20.728
What do you mean, chemical reaction?

11:20.943 --> 11:24.312
The fluoride is binding
to your cellular calcium...

11:24.530 --> 11:26.568
...to form calcium fluoride...

11:26.781 --> 11:29.651
...the crystal salt that
seeps into your body tissues.

11:29.868 --> 11:31.527
So, what does that mean?

11:31.744 --> 11:34.412
We're already seeing changes
in your cardiogram.

11:34.621 --> 11:36.032
So now what?

11:36.372 --> 11:40.369
As the calcium level
in your cardiac cells fall...

11:40.959 --> 11:42.916
...your heart's going
to begin to fail.

11:45.462 --> 11:47.371
Are you saying I'm gonna die?

11:48.757 --> 11:51.164
- We're doing everything we can.
- Is that a yes?

11:53.969 --> 11:55.760
Yes.

11:56.096 --> 11:57.340
How long?

11:59.974 --> 12:01.765
Days?

12:02.851 --> 12:04.677
Maybe 12 hours.

12:12.066 --> 12:14.141
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

12:22.240 --> 12:24.410
Mr. Canterna?

12:29.574 --> 12:31.483
I don't feel that bad.

12:31.701 --> 12:33.527
Let me know if the pain increases.

12:33.703 --> 12:36.454
It hurts. I just
don't feel like I'm dying.

12:36.665 --> 12:39.998
We'll do everything we can
to keep you comfortable.

12:40.210 --> 12:44.208
Maybe he's got it wrong. Shouldn't
he call a specialist or something?

12:44.421 --> 12:46.165
You guys are giving up on me-

12:46.382 --> 12:49.881
We're not giving up on you.
I promise you that.

12:50.094 --> 12:51.670
We'll do everything we can.

12:51.887 --> 12:54.460
Are you sure there isn't someone
we can call for you?

12:54.681 --> 12:56.970
- It's too late.
- How far away are they?

12:57.184 --> 13:00.019
No, I've been gone too long.
She won't come.

13:00.187 --> 13:01.977
Who won't?

13:02.480 --> 13:03.512
My daughter.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.856
-21 years old. Complains of neck-
- We're full here. Next room.

13:08.069 --> 13:11.189
Neck, back and ankle pain following
a 75-foot fall in the river.

13:11.405 --> 13:13.362
- From where?
- From a train bridge.

13:13.574 --> 13:16.741
Sinus rhythm, A and O times 3.
ETOH on breath.

13:16.953 --> 13:18.696
Sensory and motor exam, normal.

13:18.912 --> 13:23.658
Okay, CBC, dip a urine, cross-table
C- spine, chest and pelvic x-rays.

13:23.876 --> 13:25.039
- Does that hurt?
- A little.

13:25.252 --> 13:27.292
Okay, and lift.

13:27.672 --> 13:30.707
- What were you doing on the bridge?
- It's a long story.

13:31.091 --> 13:32.669
- How about here?
- No.

13:32.885 --> 13:36.717
- BP's 120/70. Pulse is 112.
- Is that bad?

13:36.930 --> 13:38.590
We're just checking everything.

13:38.808 --> 13:41.215
Good peripheral pulse.
Normal cap refill.

13:41.393 --> 13:44.394
Follow with bilateral ankle films
and call Psych.

13:44.604 --> 13:47.641
- I don't need a shrink.
- Relax. Everything's fine.

13:47.856 --> 13:49.897
I didn't jump,
if that's what you think.

13:50.109 --> 13:52.352
- I didn't jump.
- Did you take any drugs?

13:52.570 --> 13:55.774
No, I was there with my buddies.
We were just fooling around.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.148
- How much did you drink?
- A couple beers.

13:58.367 --> 14:01.986
Well, you also have a couple
of broken ankles. Throw in a BA.

14:02.205 --> 14:04.032
- Where are you going?
- Just relax.

14:04.207 --> 14:05.237
Everything okay?

14:05.458 --> 14:09.407
Joker jumps off of a bridge and
walks away with ankle fractures.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.165
Called Psych? I'll tell Weaver.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.254
- Surgical consult?
- Trauma 2.

14:13.423 --> 14:16.258
He changed his mind.
He wants to see his daughter.

14:16.427 --> 14:20.293
- I thought he didn't have any family.
- He hasn't seen her in six years.

14:20.513 --> 14:22.553
- How old is she?
- Six and a half.

14:22.766 --> 14:24.260
- Oh, boy!
- I'll take care of it.

14:24.476 --> 14:25.591
- You sure?
- Go home.

14:25.811 --> 14:27.434
I should stick around.

14:27.604 --> 14:31.388
There's nothing else for you to do
except hold his hand, which is my job.

14:31.608 --> 14:34.312
- All right. Thank you.
- And another breath in.

14:34.528 --> 14:37.149
- Got a sec?
- Sure. I'll be right back.

14:37.364 --> 14:40.447
CBC, pulse ox, lytes, ABG
and a chest film.

14:40.617 --> 14:45.528
Still waiting for an ICU bed.
Pulse ox is falling slowly.

14:45.747 --> 14:49.364
I haven't talked to him about a vent
yet. I wanted the news to set in.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.208
Carol is looking for the family.

14:51.418 --> 14:54.455
- All right. Have a good Sunday.
- Thank you.

14:54.671 --> 14:55.752
Sorry.

14:55.923 --> 14:59.458
I know you're busy. I don't
usually come to the ER for the flu.

14:59.635 --> 15:01.545
But I can't seem to beat this cough.

15:01.761 --> 15:04.335
- How long have you felt fatigued?
- About a month.

15:04.557 --> 15:06.098
Any weight loss?

15:06.308 --> 15:08.846
I've been so stressed
planning this wedding.

15:09.060 --> 15:12.809
Congratulations. Is that
a daughter or a granddaughter?

15:12.981 --> 15:14.262
It's my wedding.

15:14.483 --> 15:17.483
After 4 years, I told her
it was time to make a commitment.

15:17.652 --> 15:18.980
Well, good for you.

15:19.195 --> 15:21.022
Gives me a month to get better.

15:21.239 --> 15:24.026
No promises.
You might have pneumonia.

15:24.243 --> 15:26.033
We'll know more
after the chest x-ray.

15:26.244 --> 15:28.569
Didn't you have
that voodoo woman yesterday?

15:28.788 --> 15:29.985
- She's back?
- Yeah.

15:30.164 --> 15:32.869
She says voodoo man
has taken over her body.

15:33.084 --> 15:35.491
This isn't the same one.
Mine was 60.

15:35.711 --> 15:39.330
- I had a voodoo guy last week.
- Oh, no. Voodoo epidemic.

15:39.548 --> 15:40.627
Sorry.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.421
Ma'am, your ex-husband is
in critical condition.

15:43.635 --> 15:46.209
I know you are at work.
He just-

15:46.848 --> 15:50.346
Look, he's going to die tonight.
He just wants to see Molly.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.391
- Anybody home?
- What have you got?

15:52.602 --> 15:53.682
Pedestrian versus auto.

15:53.896 --> 15:57.229
Head contusion, brief LOC,
broken arm, vitals are stable.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.146
- What's open, Chuny?
- Curtain 3.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.435
- Curtain 3.
- Cerebral palsy?

16:02.654 --> 16:05.655
I don't know.
He couldn't tell us if he was hurt.

16:05.866 --> 16:08.701
- No one was with him?
- Nope. Just found him on the street.

16:08.910 --> 16:12.610
- Sir, can you tell me your name?
- No use. You can't understand him.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.666
He might have a subdural.
That could impair his speech.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.663
- We should get a head CT.
- How do you do a neuro exam?

16:18.877 --> 16:21.629
It would help if we knew his baseline.

16:22.883 --> 16:26.166
Sir, can you push
against my hand here?

16:27.011 --> 16:28.967
All right.
Let's start with a C-spine.

16:29.178 --> 16:30.840
- Have you seen Elizabeth?
- No.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.848
- Wasn't she called down?
- I just got here.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.059
- Anna?
- She's right there, actually.

16:38.229 --> 16:39.890
I thought you weren't coming in.

16:40.066 --> 16:43.065
I wasn't, but I decided to come in
and do post-op notes.

16:43.275 --> 16:45.103
- You look dapper.
- Thank you.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.609
- How was the baptism?
- Good. It was good.

16:47.822 --> 16:50.029
- Nothing afterwards?
- Want to go eat?

16:50.242 --> 16:52.733
- I've got this thing with Romano.
- What thing?

16:52.952 --> 16:56.368
Lunch. I think it's about
my fellowship renewal.

16:56.581 --> 16:59.748
- You really came in for post-op notes?
- Yeah. I'll see you later?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.073
Yeah, I hope so.

17:01.294 --> 17:04.709
You should call the military.
They might have an antidote.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.079
My buddy says
they use stuff like this.

17:07.258 --> 17:09.415
Yeah, it's not really the same thing.

17:09.636 --> 17:12.339
- I just wanted you to know.
- I know.

17:13.181 --> 17:16.430
- Did you find her?
- I talked to your ex-wife.

17:16.642 --> 17:17.756
What'd she say?

17:17.976 --> 17:20.762
She said that she's sorry, but...

17:20.979 --> 17:23.102
She's not gonna bring Molly?

17:23.272 --> 17:24.304
No.

17:25.107 --> 17:27.598
She knows what's happening to me?

17:29.612 --> 17:31.107
That's okay.

17:31.782 --> 17:35.280
- Maybe this is for the best, I guess.
- I'm sorry.

17:35.618 --> 17:38.025
I was gonna make it up to her...

17:38.246 --> 17:40.915
...but I guess I ran
out of time, you know?

17:41.375 --> 17:45.502
You'll have to let us know
if you want to be put on a ventilator.

17:45.711 --> 17:48.831
- Dr. Weaver, do you have a minute?
- Yeah. What is it?

17:49.047 --> 17:51.124
Auto vs. pedestrian.
Possible head injury.

17:51.299 --> 17:53.092
- What's the problem?
- Cerebral palsy.

17:53.301 --> 17:55.591
He's tough to assess
and we don't want to hurt him.

17:55.805 --> 17:58.970
All right. Call me at
the first sign of arrhythmia.

17:59.182 --> 18:02.137
- He might be posturing.
- No, he's conscious.

18:02.352 --> 18:03.466
Is he on any meds?

18:03.644 --> 18:05.851
I don't know.
We can't understand him.

18:06.064 --> 18:08.769
- Did you check for Med-Alert?
- Let me grab this.

18:09.025 --> 18:10.982
- I need a C-spine.
- X-ray, Trauma 2.

18:11.152 --> 18:12.183
No, I got him.

18:12.404 --> 18:14.313
- When did you call?
- I didn't, but I need it.

18:14.532 --> 18:16.273
- So do I.
- Well, how bad is yours?

18:16.491 --> 18:18.317
- How bad is yours?
- I need a hand here!

18:18.535 --> 18:21.986
- Grab that gurney.
- I need a C collar and a backboard.

18:22.204 --> 18:24.032
- I got him.
- Conni, get Doug.

18:24.248 --> 18:26.537
- Why didn't you call 911?
- I thought I'd be faster.

18:26.751 --> 18:29.324
- How long has he been unconscious?
- He just stopped crying.

18:29.545 --> 18:31.169
- Pulse is weak.
- What happened?

18:31.380 --> 18:33.538
We were washing the car.
I didn't see him.

18:33.758 --> 18:35.548
- We need that room!
- I backed up a few feet.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.678
Get that guy out of there!
We're gonna roll him.

18:38.888 --> 18:40.132
Hang on. Roll him.

18:40.347 --> 18:42.505
- Did you drive over him?
- I think so.

18:42.725 --> 18:44.847
Get Radiology over here!

18:45.143 --> 18:47.812
- Cap refill is poor.
- What's going on?

18:48.021 --> 18:52.350
I need 2 units of O-negative.
Get me a crit. Type and cross for 6.

18:52.525 --> 18:56.226
Put him on oxygen, 10 liters by mask.
Dip a urine.

18:56.446 --> 18:58.985
Pupils are equal and reactive.

18:59.199 --> 19:00.775
I've got a line in.

19:00.992 --> 19:05.488
Saline, 20 cc's per kilo bolus.

19:05.705 --> 19:08.030
That's 30. That's 600, right?

19:08.249 --> 19:11.084
BP is 70/30. Pulse is 144.

19:11.294 --> 19:13.251
Abdomen is distended.
No bowel sounds.

19:13.462 --> 19:16.417
- Can't wait for a CT.
- Let's prep for a peritoneal lavage.

19:16.631 --> 19:18.839
- I'll get a kit.
- Pulse ox?

19:20.386 --> 19:22.675
- You okay in there?
- Where are the lavage kits?

19:22.888 --> 19:24.216
- Down and right.
- What's that?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.511
- What?
- Lavage.

19:25.724 --> 19:28.216
It's a procedure to check
for internal bleeding.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.969
- That sounds pretty bad.
- Well, you never know.

19:32.522 --> 19:34.396
Is it a boy or a girl?

19:34.608 --> 19:35.854
It's a boy.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.736
You could go in there
if you need to because-

19:38.945 --> 19:40.901
No, no, no. They got it.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.153
Can I ask you
to do something for me, nurse?

19:44.367 --> 19:45.399
Yeah.

19:45.743 --> 19:49.158
I have a couple of thousand dollars
in my savings account.

19:49.372 --> 19:51.032
Can you make sure it gets to Molly?

19:51.248 --> 19:54.914
- Sure. Do you have a will?
- No. I didn't get around to it.

19:55.086 --> 19:57.755
But I want to make sure
I get her the money.

19:57.921 --> 19:59.796
It's not much,
but I want to give it to her.

20:00.008 --> 20:03.043
I can get a public notary in here.
I'll take care of it.

20:03.261 --> 20:05.418
- You promise?
- I promise.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.759
But don't tell her
that it came from me.

20:07.931 --> 20:10.257
I don't want her to think
I'm buying her forgiveness.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.432
Sorry. Hallway's blocked.

20:13.771 --> 20:14.885
5.5 ET tube.

20:15.105 --> 20:17.312
- Got the blood.
- Hang a unit, I'll start a second.

20:17.524 --> 20:21.107
A rapid induction,
0.5 of Pavulon, 75 of sux.

20:21.278 --> 20:22.308
Cut.

20:23.529 --> 20:24.728
Cricoid pressure, please.

20:24.947 --> 20:26.822
I didn't mean to do this to you.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.943
- I didn't mean to do this.
- Crike's 28.

20:29.118 --> 20:30.826
Lavage is positive.

20:31.036 --> 20:33.113
Call the O.R.
Tell them we're on our way.

20:33.289 --> 20:36.077
- Doug, are you done?
- Almost. Hang on, hang on.

20:36.292 --> 20:39.910
- Got it.
- We have to do a laparotomy.

20:40.129 --> 20:41.292
What's wrong with him?

20:41.506 --> 20:43.961
We have to control
the internal bleeding.

20:44.174 --> 20:47.923
- I need you to sign a release form.
- Okay, just don't let him die.

20:48.137 --> 20:50.972
- He has a good chance.
- Hold that elevator!

20:51.181 --> 20:53.850
Conni, you gotta cover
my patient in Trauma 1.

20:54.059 --> 20:56.728
- You're leaving?
- Everything is on the chart.

20:56.937 --> 20:59.143
- Where are you going?
- Can you do it for me?

20:59.313 --> 21:01.307
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:04.361 --> 21:05.476
Don't let him die!

21:05.696 --> 21:07.687
- I need you to sign.
- Don't let him die.

21:07.906 --> 21:11.302
- I understand. I understand.
- Please? Don't let him die.

21:14.931 --> 21:17.469
Turkey burger, please. No onions.

21:17.684 --> 21:20.436
What kind of salad dressings
do you have?

21:20.686 --> 21:23.772
Caesar, ranch, Italian,
blue cheese, honey mustard...

21:23.982 --> 21:26.768
...Catalina, oil and vinegar
and poppy seed vinaigrette.

21:27.901 --> 21:29.360
I'll have the soup.

21:35.868 --> 21:36.898
So...

21:37.577 --> 21:39.866
- So.
- Enjoying your year?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.324
It's been educational.

21:41.539 --> 21:44.908
I bet.
Thoughts of staying, come fall?

21:45.125 --> 21:47.118
I've entertained the idea.

21:47.377 --> 21:48.410
Good.

21:49.421 --> 21:51.378
Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

21:51.756 --> 21:52.837
No, not exactly.

21:54.592 --> 21:55.708
Must I guess?

21:59.806 --> 22:02.973
There's no way to say this
but flat out, so here goes.

22:04.559 --> 22:08.260
Our relationship has not moved
in a direction I would have liked.

22:08.438 --> 22:10.894
I have trouble communicating
these types of feelings.

22:11.107 --> 22:14.192
But the fact is,
I find you very attractive.

22:14.486 --> 22:16.229
- Dr. Romano-
- Let me finish.

22:16.445 --> 22:19.232
I don't know what
your long-term plans are...

22:19.449 --> 22:21.156
...and I'm not foolish enough
to think...

22:21.325 --> 22:24.777
...that colleagues can have an
involvement without entanglements.

22:25.704 --> 22:29.868
But we have a lot of common interests
and we share the same schedule.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.495
And it makes sense.

22:31.709 --> 22:35.327
So I would really like you
to consider a date.

22:35.839 --> 22:38.293
Going out with me, on a date.
What do you say?

22:40.467 --> 22:42.756
I'm flattered and shocked.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.258
Really? I thought
you'd see right through me.

22:45.472 --> 22:47.844
No. No, not at all.

22:48.058 --> 22:49.221
However...

22:50.018 --> 22:52.425
...seeing as I do work for you...

22:52.895 --> 22:55.433
...I don't think
it would be such a good idea.

22:59.026 --> 23:01.102
Not that under
other circumstances...

23:01.361 --> 23:03.437
Oh, I see. You have a policy.

23:03.697 --> 23:06.899
- Yes, I do.
- No fraternizing with people at work.

23:07.117 --> 23:11.861
Okay, I respect that. Just pretend
that I never said anything.

23:13.372 --> 23:14.404
I'm sorry.

23:14.622 --> 23:15.905
No, hey.

23:18.545 --> 23:20.086
I had to give it a shot.

23:23.423 --> 23:27.586
You know what's funny? For a while,
I thought I was competing with Benton.

23:30.638 --> 23:32.180
Can you open your fist?

23:34.724 --> 23:36.967
How about your fingers?
Just do that.

23:39.730 --> 23:41.887
How about just your fingers?

23:42.565 --> 23:43.680
What are you doing?

23:43.899 --> 23:46.141
Weaver said to examine him
like any patient.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.065
- By pinning his arm down?
- I'm isolating finger motion.

23:49.238 --> 23:52.239
- You're not afraid of hurting him?
- Actually, yes.

23:56.452 --> 23:59.026
- He's trying to tell me something.
- Head CT's normal.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.615
No subdural bleeds,
no sign of brain abnormalities.

24:03.709 --> 24:04.908
He opened his hand.

24:06.503 --> 24:07.747
How about that?

24:08.547 --> 24:10.207
He's got a bad lac.

24:11.509 --> 24:12.884
He might've cut a tendon.

24:13.676 --> 24:15.551
They didn't teach
this in med school.

24:15.762 --> 24:18.335
I guess we could call
a hand surgeon down here.

24:18.973 --> 24:20.515
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

24:20.725 --> 24:24.011
- Is he having a seizure or something?
- I don't know.

24:25.604 --> 24:29.436
The x-ray indicates you have
what we call atypical pneumonia.

24:29.649 --> 24:31.855
- What does that mean?
- There are several kinds.

24:32.068 --> 24:35.567
- Do you have any birds in the house?
- How did you know?

24:35.780 --> 24:39.480
Psittacosis pneumonia
is carried by small birds.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.906
What is it?
Is it a parakeet or a dove?

24:42.119 --> 24:44.112
- A falcon.
- A falcon?

24:44.287 --> 24:46.529
Only thing Daniel loves more than me.

24:46.748 --> 24:47.779
That's not true.

24:47.958 --> 24:49.784
I want to go to Italy
for our honeymoon.

24:50.002 --> 24:52.242
He didn't want
to leave Sinbad that long.

24:52.462 --> 24:53.576
Who's gonna feed him?

24:53.796 --> 24:55.956
- What does he eat?
- Partridges.

24:56.214 --> 24:57.247
It's not pretty.

24:57.466 --> 25:00.716
He doesn't eat them alive.
We kill them and clean them first.

25:00.969 --> 25:02.761
That's where I come in.

25:02.972 --> 25:05.925
Well, that's probably how
you contracted the pneumonia.

25:06.140 --> 25:08.597
I'll get a blood test
to see what type.

25:08.810 --> 25:11.383
But we can treat it
with antibiotics.

25:12.814 --> 25:16.228
Funny, I thought
I was covering the ER.

25:16.442 --> 25:18.518
I was there, so I took it.

25:18.735 --> 25:20.608
What happened to your post-op notes?

25:20.820 --> 25:24.070
- I thought we were past these games.
- Excuse me?

25:24.283 --> 25:27.946
The adolescent competition.
He was in bad shape. Give it a rest.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.912
Peter, I was simply commenting
on how strange-

25:31.122 --> 25:32.746
You don't "simply" do anything.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.704
- Something the matter?
- The boy could bleed out.

25:35.918 --> 25:39.037
I mean, with you. Has something
happened since this morning?

25:39.254 --> 25:41.046
No. I'm fine.

25:42.132 --> 25:44.588
Dr. Benton, I didn't know
you were working today.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.924
Yeah. I am now.

25:47.137 --> 25:49.628
I'm glad to hear I'm not
the only one without a life.

25:50.014 --> 25:53.299
6- year-old male,
sustained splenic fracture...

25:53.601 --> 25:55.510
- Bus tour?
- Thank you.

25:58.063 --> 25:59.687
Sandy Madder?

26:00.690 --> 26:04.557
Hi, I'm Carol Hathaway. We spoke
on the phone about your ex-husband.

26:04.777 --> 26:08.692
I'm sorry I can't help you.
Just go right on. I'm working, okay?

26:08.865 --> 26:11.864
Look, I don't pretend
to know the history here.

26:12.075 --> 26:13.238
That's right.

26:13.702 --> 26:17.746
Your ex-husband isn't gonna
make it through the night.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.245
Paul walked out on us.
Here you go. Bus tour.

26:21.459 --> 26:24.708
He just left. He couldn't hold a job,
couldn't handle it.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.755
I feel bad for him,
but he's not a part of our lives.

26:27.965 --> 26:29.922
- Bus tour?
- All he wants to do is see Molly.

26:30.134 --> 26:33.798
He was never there for her,
but now he wants her to watch him die?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.212
You really want him to die alone?

26:36.388 --> 26:37.800
Who are you?

26:39.350 --> 26:42.802
This isn't your business. I'm not
putting my daughter through that.

26:43.021 --> 26:47.065
I understand how you feel.
And you don't know me.

26:48.067 --> 26:50.983
But trust me,
you're making a mistake here.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.488
I was a girl when my father
was dying in the hospital.

26:54.698 --> 26:58.943
And I couldn't see him. I wasn't
given a chance to say goodbye.

26:59.619 --> 27:03.236
You think you're protecting Molly,
but she'll have to live with this.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.786
Did you know him, your father,
before he died?

27:05.958 --> 27:06.989
I remember him.

27:07.168 --> 27:10.416
Molly won't remember Paul.
She has no recollection of him.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.671
Now, I'm sorry,
but he chose this for himself.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.339
Has anyone seen Carol?

27:21.556 --> 27:23.928
She had some
administrative stuff upstairs.

27:24.141 --> 27:26.133
- On Sunday?
- Something about payroll.

27:26.351 --> 27:30.183
Mr. Canterna is asking for her.
He needs 40 Lasix, IV.

27:30.396 --> 27:31.428
I'll get it.

27:31.648 --> 27:36.226
Kerry, your labs came back.
Mrs. Weinbach tested positive for HIV.

27:36.444 --> 27:39.396
No, Mrs. Weinbach is
the older lady with the bird.

27:39.613 --> 27:41.024
Yeah. I made them redo it.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.904
I asked for cold agglutinin
and antibodies, not HIV.

27:45.118 --> 27:47.360
Are you sure?
It was marked on the form.

27:47.578 --> 27:51.659
Oh, my God. It makes total sense.
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

27:51.873 --> 27:53.368
- Want to do another one?
- No.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.076
I can't do an HIV test
without consent.

27:56.294 --> 27:58.086
Now what?

27:58.755 --> 28:01.591
- He's been on methadone since birth?
- Yeah.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.299
- You haven't stopped and started?
- No.

28:05.554 --> 28:09.764
That's a long time. It's tough
on neurological development.

28:09.974 --> 28:12.299
They told me to give him less,
but it doesn't work.

28:12.643 --> 28:13.673
Are you still using?

28:14.144 --> 28:15.307
What does it matter?

28:15.480 --> 28:17.602
- If you're breast-feeding-
- I don't.

28:20.858 --> 28:24.441
Your baby has a high fever.
He's sweating.

28:24.655 --> 28:27.773
His pupils are dilated.
He has an abnormally high heart rate.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.611
All signs of withdrawal.
Now, why would that be?

28:30.826 --> 28:32.866
I don't know. You're the doctor.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.651
When was his last dose? Come here.

28:35.831 --> 28:36.862
Yesterday.

28:37.082 --> 28:40.532
I ran out. My clinic is closed
on Sunday, so I came here.

28:40.793 --> 28:41.824
More methadone?

28:42.211 --> 28:43.456
It's what he needs.

28:43.671 --> 28:44.916
You don't need it?

28:45.547 --> 28:46.627
What?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.757
You're using your baby
to get methadone.

28:49.050 --> 28:50.793
I can get that for free.

28:51.011 --> 28:54.012
I think you come here
when you can't score.

28:54.181 --> 28:56.588
- I don't need this.
- He needs to be admitted.

28:57.350 --> 28:59.841
No way. You'll call the cops.

29:00.019 --> 29:03.269
You come here because no place else
will give you the stuff.

29:03.689 --> 29:05.979
If you leave,
that baby won't get treatment.

29:06.191 --> 29:08.184
Then give me some and let me go!

29:08.360 --> 29:10.269
Until next time?

29:11.155 --> 29:14.404
Vicki, you addicted your son.
You strung him out.

29:15.116 --> 29:17.357
Don't you think it's time
to do something right?

29:21.080 --> 29:23.535
Wait for his family.
Someone will be looking for him.

29:23.708 --> 29:24.869
What if he's homeless?

29:25.083 --> 29:27.621
He couldn't survive
out on the street alone.

29:29.587 --> 29:33.039
The cops are checking the
neighborhood. He can't live that far.

29:34.842 --> 29:37.249
Hey, take it easy. Take it easy.
It's okay.

29:37.470 --> 29:40.719
- Why does he keep banging?
- Maybe he is telling us something.

29:44.142 --> 29:45.721
I don't understand.

29:49.981 --> 29:51.808
What is that, ring? Ring?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.602
- Ring what?
- A phone?

29:53.817 --> 29:55.526
You want us to call somebody?

29:56.570 --> 29:59.488
Lie still if that's
what you want us to do.

30:06.663 --> 30:09.117
- Four?
- Four? Four what?

30:09.624 --> 30:11.782
Are you giving us
your telephone number?

30:12.001 --> 30:14.575
Four is the first number
of your telephone?

30:14.962 --> 30:17.288
- Here. Thanks.
- Four, then what?

30:18.758 --> 30:20.583
Then two.

30:20.759 --> 30:21.790
Two?

30:22.677 --> 30:26.757
I'll tell the father,
and I'll meet you in Recovery.

30:34.730 --> 30:36.770
Your son sustained
irreparable damage...

30:36.940 --> 30:39.098
...to the blood vessels
supplying the spleen.

30:39.276 --> 30:42.026
We had no choice
but to perform a splenectomy.

30:42.945 --> 30:44.606
But he's alive?

30:44.863 --> 30:48.363
Yeah, yeah. No, of course.
I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:48.534 --> 30:49.564
Thank God!

30:49.785 --> 30:53.320
Look, in time
he'll make a full recovery.

30:57.292 --> 31:00.495
Now, listen to me. He's gonna
be prone to certain infections...

31:00.712 --> 31:03.416
...so he'll need
to be vaccinated against-

31:03.631 --> 31:04.911
Thank you.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.424
Thank you so much.

31:08.428 --> 31:11.178
I made a mistake about the birds.

31:11.471 --> 31:14.176
You may have what's called
pneumocystis pneumonia.

31:14.391 --> 31:16.466
- Is that worse?
- We need to get a sample...

31:16.684 --> 31:18.807
...from your bronchial tube
to confirm it.

31:19.020 --> 31:23.101
But since it's the defining illness
of AIDS, we should do an HIV test.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.391
- AIDS?
- That's a good one.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.812
- We need to be sure.
- You don't know Loretta.

31:29.362 --> 31:32.483
- Can I speak with her alone?
- Why?

31:32.657 --> 31:36.239
No, it's all right.
Daniel's practically my husband.

31:37.037 --> 31:40.322
To tell the truth,
we made a mistake.

31:40.705 --> 31:43.742
We need written consent
from our patients to test for HIV.

31:44.168 --> 31:48.331
However, we tested you by accident,
and it was positive.

31:48.755 --> 31:52.456
- I don't understand.
- It was a mistake, a mix-up.

31:52.675 --> 31:54.917
Perhaps another test
would remove any doubt.

31:55.135 --> 31:57.046
I'll take care of this.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.342
Doctor.

32:06.021 --> 32:08.642
Give her something for
the pneumonia and we'll go.

32:08.857 --> 32:10.980
- I can't do that.
- Don't make me report you.

32:11.192 --> 32:13.351
- Excuse me?
- You tested her illegally.

32:13.528 --> 32:16.896
Yes, but it would be unethical
to let her leave untreated.

32:17.114 --> 32:19.521
I don't want to burden her with this.

32:19.699 --> 32:20.945
Have you been tested?

32:22.076 --> 32:24.912
I'm not talking about me, all right?

32:25.372 --> 32:29.499
There are drug programs that would
drastically enhance both your lives.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.707
Can't you say they're...

32:33.880 --> 32:35.290
...for something else?

32:36.174 --> 32:40.550
Either you should find a way
to explain it to her, or I'll have to.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.219
You disappeared on me.

32:52.396 --> 32:54.388
I needed to check on something.

32:54.898 --> 32:56.226
Molly's still not coming?

32:59.277 --> 33:00.818
I'm afraid not.

33:01.988 --> 33:05.155
It's okay. It's better this way,
she doesn't see me.

33:05.741 --> 33:08.279
Want to write her a note?
I could take something down.

33:08.494 --> 33:09.525
Yeah.

33:10.662 --> 33:12.572
No. It's too late.

33:13.748 --> 33:15.408
It wouldn't be fair.

33:15.792 --> 33:19.125
I think she'd really like
to hear something from you.

33:21.298 --> 33:23.207
I was gonna make it up
to her, I swear.

33:26.760 --> 33:30.379
I called her
a couple of times last fall.

33:30.597 --> 33:32.554
You can guess how that went over.

33:38.897 --> 33:41.655
I figured they just needed time.

33:50.133 --> 33:52.458
I'm so glad you called me.
I was going crazy.

33:52.676 --> 33:55.215
I can't believe he was able
to give us your number.

33:55.429 --> 33:59.261
Mr. Lorenzo, I am so sorry.
I lost all track of time.

33:59.433 --> 34:01.092
I got...

34:01.268 --> 34:04.767
...stuck with the rejects.

34:06.732 --> 34:08.808
I'm sorry. John Carter.

34:09.025 --> 34:10.141
You understand?

34:10.360 --> 34:13.728
Katherine Dunlap.
I'm Mr. Lorenzo's personal assistant.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.655
It takes a while to get the accent.

34:15.866 --> 34:16.980
Accent?

34:22.831 --> 34:25.618
He says you're a little slow
but he'll forgive you.

34:25.876 --> 34:30.454
Thanks. Can you tell him that
they need to operate on his hand?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.621
You just did.
He understands English.

34:33.091 --> 34:37.089
It's one of his many languages. He's
a leading expert in hieroglyphics.

34:37.636 --> 34:38.800
That's fascinating.

34:38.973 --> 34:40.514
Liar.

34:41.308 --> 34:42.422
I understood that.

34:47.771 --> 34:49.100
Would you excuse me?

34:49.649 --> 34:51.771
- Thank you.
- You're welcome...

34:53.027 --> 34:54.438
...Mr. Lorenzo.

34:58.115 --> 34:59.229
Gamma?

34:59.616 --> 35:02.821
Oh, John. I'm sorry
to bother you at work.

35:02.995 --> 35:04.026
What's wrong?

35:04.622 --> 35:08.406
I'm not happy the way we left things
earlier. Do you have a moment?

35:09.292 --> 35:10.492
Yeah, sure.

35:13.839 --> 35:16.590
- Do you want to sit down?
- No. Thank you.

35:18.052 --> 35:20.969
John, I respect your opinion.

35:21.263 --> 35:24.798
If you think we should keep Chase
at the institute, I'll support that.

35:26.684 --> 35:29.354
I can't guarantee that
it'll make any difference...

35:29.521 --> 35:30.848
...but I won't give up on him.

35:31.315 --> 35:32.477
I never intend to.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.180
Neither do I.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.768
I'm glad we've got that
straightened out.

35:38.238 --> 35:39.483
Me too.

35:43.284 --> 35:47.033
I understand the freedom that
comes with financial independence.

35:47.788 --> 35:51.787
But money or not,
we're still your family.

35:52.460 --> 35:53.623
I know.

35:54.421 --> 35:56.959
You were always
your grandfather's first choice.

35:57.340 --> 35:59.582
He's much too proud
to come to you now...

35:59.801 --> 36:02.007
...but he'd really like you
to come to him.

36:02.762 --> 36:04.138
What are you asking me?

36:06.515 --> 36:08.555
Finish your residency if you must.

36:08.726 --> 36:11.347
You can always
practice medicine part-time.

36:12.020 --> 36:15.889
But your family needs you, John.
We need you to run the business.

36:17.401 --> 36:18.481
I don't know.

36:18.695 --> 36:19.892
Please.

36:21.322 --> 36:22.566
Think about it.

36:23.115 --> 36:26.484
No, I don't need to think about it.
Gamma, I can't.

36:26.910 --> 36:30.529
I'm a doctor. It's all that
I've ever wanted to be since...

36:30.872 --> 36:32.247
Since your brother died.

36:32.457 --> 36:35.708
Since I was a kid.
And there's nothing else for me.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.836
You really love it that much?

36:40.674 --> 36:43.082
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:45.847 --> 36:49.297
Forgive me for asking.
I had to try.

36:50.768 --> 36:53.175
I'll see you on
your grandfather's birthday?

36:53.396 --> 36:54.557
You will.

36:55.938 --> 36:59.024
I always wondered what
you'd be like when you grew up.

37:03.988 --> 37:06.065
Hey, Conni? Whose patient is this?

37:06.282 --> 37:07.446
I think it's Doug's.

37:07.617 --> 37:09.859
- Where's the mother?
- I don't know.

37:10.577 --> 37:12.286
Yeah, it's Doug's.

37:12.496 --> 37:13.824
Get him, will you?

37:14.123 --> 37:18.072
Hi, sweetheart.
It's okay. It's okay.

37:21.714 --> 37:23.956
- What happened?
- I just found him alone.

37:24.467 --> 37:27.302
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, well, this baby has a fever.

37:27.470 --> 37:31.052
He's in heroin withdrawal.
The mother's stealing his methadone.

37:31.265 --> 37:32.463
So she split?

37:32.640 --> 37:35.595
- I told her to do the right thing.
- Maybe she did.

37:36.478 --> 37:37.937
Unbelievable.

37:39.189 --> 37:40.767
It's okay, buddy.

37:43.485 --> 37:45.774
No, please. Leave it open.

37:48.824 --> 37:50.282
How much longer?

37:52.786 --> 37:54.363
It's hard to tell.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.321
Please.

38:00.336 --> 38:01.534
Not long.

38:04.839 --> 38:06.299
I'm scared.

38:06.924 --> 38:08.503
I won't leave you.

38:13.723 --> 38:16.344
Do you have things
you wish you did different?

38:18.479 --> 38:20.020
Doesn't everybody?

38:22.773 --> 38:24.979
You should fix it if you can.

38:27.278 --> 38:28.440
Maybe.

38:32.283 --> 38:34.525
Want me to read you back the letter?

38:40.458 --> 38:41.833
"Dear Molly:

38:44.629 --> 38:47.714
You don't know me. I'm your father.

38:48.632 --> 38:51.586
I suppose I shouldn't
even call myself that.

38:52.219 --> 38:54.675
You're the best thing
I ever did with my life.

38:56.598 --> 38:58.805
Leaving you was the worst.

39:00.311 --> 39:03.726
God knows I haven't done much
for you while I was alive...

39:03.897 --> 39:06.020
...but if there's a place
called heaven...

39:06.233 --> 39:08.023
...and they let me in...

39:09.153 --> 39:11.608
...I promise to always look over you.

39:13.614 --> 39:17.744
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry I never got to know you. "

39:30.423 --> 39:31.622
Me too.

39:49.316 --> 39:51.808
I'm gonna start to worry about you.

39:52.445 --> 39:54.402
First you work on a holiday...

39:54.614 --> 39:58.825
...and now I find you alone,
standing out here in the dark.

40:01.286 --> 40:04.406
- What are you doing out here?
- Looking for you.

40:05.332 --> 40:06.957
Well, you found me.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.331
That brooding veneer
is part of your appeal...

40:11.546 --> 40:14.215
...but I thought
I'd broken through most of it.

40:18.971 --> 40:22.470
I should be at Carla's restaurant
celebrating my son's baptism.

40:22.641 --> 40:25.677
I see. And you're here because...?

40:28.103 --> 40:29.979
I don't want to feel like an intruder.

40:30.189 --> 40:32.811
Like I have to share my son
with Carla's boyfriend.

40:33.610 --> 40:35.400
Do you?

40:36.280 --> 40:39.979
He spends all the time with him.
How do I compete with that?

40:40.658 --> 40:44.276
You're his father, Peter.
You don't have to compete.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.822
Then I thought I'd come and see you,
but you had that lunch thing.

40:49.501 --> 40:50.663
Are you jealous?

40:53.755 --> 40:55.747
Well, your instincts were right.

40:56.299 --> 41:00.248
- Romano propositioned me.
- Are you serious? What did you say?

41:00.927 --> 41:05.970
I lied. I said I don't date colleagues.
It's cowardly of me, I know.

41:06.392 --> 41:07.933
That's okay. I lied too.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.935
What, about me?

41:10.354 --> 41:14.101
So much for a relationship
without complications.

41:18.487 --> 41:20.147
You know what? Screw it.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.612
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

41:22.825 --> 41:26.607
- To the party. There's still time.
- You don't have to prove anything.

41:26.828 --> 41:29.319
Elizabeth, I know that.
I just want to go.

41:29.539 --> 41:31.697
You should go,
but you should go alone.

41:31.875 --> 41:34.081
For your son. This is his day.

41:37.255 --> 41:38.797
Yeah, you're right.

41:39.799 --> 41:41.376
Hey, thanks.

41:44.011 --> 41:47.215
Listen, if it's not too late...

41:47.641 --> 41:50.048
Listen, I'll be up.
Are you kidding?

41:55.981 --> 41:57.227
Hey, Anna!

41:57.400 --> 41:58.728
Hey, Carter.

41:58.901 --> 42:00.360
Want some cookie?

42:00.570 --> 42:02.313
- You off?
- Yep. You?

42:02.530 --> 42:03.905
- Another six hours.
- Bummer.

42:04.073 --> 42:08.117
- Did you discharge Mr. Lorenzo?
- Yes. He even gave me his web site.

42:08.327 --> 42:10.782
Why? So you could feel like an idiot?

42:13.791 --> 42:14.823
Max!

42:40.066 --> 42:41.940
Oh, sorry.

42:42.945 --> 42:44.189
That's okay.

42:44.404 --> 42:45.733
What time is it?

42:45.947 --> 42:49.363
- Ten to 2. Are you on call?
- I'm waiting for Carol.

42:49.575 --> 42:52.660
She should be ready.
They called it a half-hour ago.

42:52.871 --> 42:53.949
Thanks.

43:07.719 --> 43:11.798
- I'll just be another minute.
- That's all right. Take your time.

43:14.476 --> 43:15.850
Tough one, huh?

43:17.061 --> 43:19.220
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.898
You sure?

43:23.317 --> 43:25.606
He kept asking for his daughter.

43:26.946 --> 43:28.737
I never thought of it like that.

43:31.868 --> 43:34.155
Maybe he was asking for me.

43:35.495 --> 43:38.330
Maybe he wanted to see me
and I never came.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.037
- Your dad was probably in a coma.
- I don't know.

43:46.089 --> 43:49.708
I've lived my mother's version
of it for so long, I don't know...

43:49.926 --> 43:51.338
...what memories are mine.

43:51.762 --> 43:52.792
What's her version?

43:53.012 --> 43:56.761
Everything was all right.
That it was an accident.

44:02.772 --> 44:04.764
He was depressed, Doug.

44:06.234 --> 44:08.726
Maybe it's time
you talked to your mom about it.

44:15.117 --> 44:18.034
After he was gone,
my mom used to go on and on...

44:18.246 --> 44:20.572
...about how you can
never depend on men.

44:21.499 --> 44:24.915
Now she's head over heels
and I'm the one holding back.

44:25.127 --> 44:27.119
How messed up is that?

44:27.422 --> 44:29.331
It keeps me on my toes.

44:34.720 --> 44:37.507
I say I want time,
but the truth is...

44:39.557 --> 44:41.931
...I'm scared to death of losing you.

44:42.645 --> 44:44.269
Well, don't be.

44:46.106 --> 44:48.099
I'm so sorry, Doug.

44:48.817 --> 44:50.193
Don't be.

44:52.279 --> 44:53.737
I love you.

44:54.406 --> 44:57.088
I love you too.
