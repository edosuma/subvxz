00:44.540 --> 00:46.860
- Have you heard from Zoia?
- Still nothing.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.840
Nothing in all these years.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.580
Look what you have!

00:54.780 --> 00:57.090
You think this has cost me nothing?

01:00.560 --> 01:05.800
<i>The sparkling girls phenomenon</i>
<i>has caused chaos in economic markets</i>

01:05.990 --> 01:09.610
<i>and Carpathia is no exception.</i>

01:10.230 --> 01:13.970
<i>President Viktor Moskalev</i>
<i>is not acting fast enough</i>

01:14.170 --> 01:17.030
<i>to deal with the economic pressures</i>
<i>of this chaos.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.870
Fuck you, Moskalev!

01:27.250 --> 01:30.420
THIEF

03:32.080 --> 03:33.460
SPARKLING GIRLS WILL BE DEALT WITH
BY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

04:03.610 --> 04:09.200
You did such a good poo,
such a good poo, my baby!

04:24.840 --> 04:30.520
I have contacts there.
They won't let this go on.

04:35.850 --> 04:38.110
The interview has moved to 4 p.m.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.110
So then we turn up at 5 p.m.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.180
They'll want to talk about the economy.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.060
I would suggest you avoid that
at all costs.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.750
I'll talk about what I like.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.050
We don't know if the banks
will open next week.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.160
The people will turn--

05:02.360 --> 05:03.950
But it could have been much worse
with a different guy in charge,

05:04.150 --> 05:05.700
did you tell them that?

05:05.900 --> 05:07.010
They're lucky I'm here.

05:11.350 --> 05:13.020
People are scared.

05:13.430 --> 05:16.190
I told them women driving was a bad idea.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.520
You give in on one thing,
where does it end?

05:21.900 --> 05:22.840
Prime Minister,

05:23.040 --> 05:24.240
you're late.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.770
The point of the interview
is to show you're still alive--

05:29.970 --> 05:33.200
The point of the interview
is to show you're still here.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.330
And to talk about the first six girls who
used this electricity and how they're--

05:36.790 --> 05:38.250
They're dead, General.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.030
They're dead.

05:40.230 --> 05:42.340
Just as we said would happen.

05:46.260 --> 05:47.180
Right?

05:48.340 --> 05:49.850
Right.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.400
General...

06:01.020 --> 06:02.730
Is there a storm coming?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.160
Yes. I think there is.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.670
It might be closer than you think.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.930
Get out!

06:50.130 --> 06:51.280
Please, no!

06:53.660 --> 06:54.890
Where are you taking us?

06:55.090 --> 06:56.450
Shut up!

06:56.950 --> 06:58.370
Behave or I'll kill you.

07:08.590 --> 07:09.880
Please.

07:12.010 --> 07:14.510
Please let me go!

07:26.570 --> 07:27.730
How old is she?

07:28.110 --> 07:30.070
No, please.

07:32.990 --> 07:33.890
How old is she?

07:34.090 --> 07:34.910
I don't know.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.320
I paid for it,
I gave good money.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.260
I told you...

07:50.590 --> 07:51.880
we don't bring
young girls anymore!

07:53.930 --> 07:55.140
No young girls!

07:55.930 --> 07:56.930
You have it!

07:57.140 --> 07:58.460
No! Please!

07:58.660 --> 07:59.640
I don't have it!

08:00.020 --> 08:01.150
- Move.
- I don't have it!

08:01.350 --> 08:02.270
Move!

08:02.560 --> 08:03.810
Move! Out!

08:12.570 --> 08:14.240
They don't want young ones anymore?

08:14.440 --> 08:15.490
I don't know.

08:26.630 --> 08:27.590
What's your name?

08:35.220 --> 08:36.600
What's your name?

08:49.860 --> 08:50.780
When will they--

10:10.440 --> 10:11.440
It's crap.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.960
In the fucking dressing room.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.100
Stop messing about!

12:01.260 --> 12:04.590
They will definitely take you. You won.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.260
Nothing is certain

12:09.180 --> 12:13.770
My mum says the government men were
watching you all the time at the trials.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.390
Oh, my God, there they are!

12:19.580 --> 12:21.570
Is that them? Oh, my God.

12:29.870 --> 12:30.950
Do that again.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.250
What's wrong?
I'm just appreciating your... skill.

12:42.090 --> 12:43.090
You know who I am?

12:44.590 --> 12:45.970
You're from the government?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.310
I'm the Finance Minister.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.670
Not sport?

12:49.860 --> 12:50.680
No.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.230
I'm the money guy.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.020
Tatiana, I have something to ask you.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.080
You want to go on a date with me?

13:31.060 --> 13:34.500
The president invited
a group of scientists

13:34.700 --> 13:37.060
to come and examine the skein.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.520
They will be with us for a while.

20:39.530 --> 20:44.720
Is your screen frozen?
We are having technical difficulties.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.200
When will this start? What's going on?

20:47.740 --> 20:50.020
I don't know, ask the General.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.940
General, when will this thing start?

20:52.140 --> 20:52.960
Soon.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.680
My baby.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.880
An unprecedented event
that challenges our country--

40:22.870 --> 40:25.000
My bracelet is loose.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.750
Would you mind?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.860
I'm sorry. He will help you.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.720
Go now!

42:03.430 --> 42:06.270
Are you still thinking
about the television in my bathroom?

43:45.540 --> 43:47.410
I want to go to the Olympics.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.660
I can make money and give it to you.

43:50.290 --> 43:53.040
And in a few year's time
when you're too old to tumble?

43:54.460 --> 43:59.260
He's too old.
What if he wants to have sex with me?

44:04.760 --> 44:07.720
Of course you'll have sex with him.

44:09.770 --> 44:15.730
And you'll be warm
and have a full tummy when you do.

44:18.610 --> 44:20.800
Mama please don't make me!

44:21.000 --> 44:23.070
You have to help me.

44:24.820 --> 44:28.330
I have worked my whole life
for you Tatiana Donici.

44:30.290 --> 44:32.370
I wish I had a chance like this.

44:34.670 --> 44:36.210
I wish I'd never been born.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.260
Me too!

45:07.030 --> 45:08.540
No goodbye for me?

46:40.920 --> 46:42.050
What have you got in there?

46:44.510 --> 46:48.540
She's nothing to worry about,
she's not all there.

46:48.730 --> 46:50.330
Go, go now...

46:50.530 --> 46:53.520
...it'll be your turn next.

57:19.890 --> 57:22.350
Sit the fuck down!
