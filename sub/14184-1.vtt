WEBVTT

02:16.346 --> 02:18.056
What have I done?

03:08.606 --> 03:12.902
We've been able to manage
your disease for 10 years.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.570
But now, the
chemotherapy is no longer

03:14.737 --> 03:16.948
controlling the cancer.

03:17.115 --> 03:19.075
The disease has spread
to the lungs and spine,

03:19.242 --> 03:23.079
and two vertebrae have
already been affected.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.082
Now, it's the chemotherapy,

03:26.249 --> 03:28.459
which is making you
weak and feeble.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.962
That's why we have to stop it.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.841
So what do we do?

03:37.301 --> 03:39.178
The best thing
medicine can offer you

03:39.345 --> 03:42.098
is a bone marrow transplant.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.683
We don't do that here yet,

03:43.850 --> 03:47.603
so I want you to go to
America for the procedure.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.275
The risk of fatality
is very high,

03:52.442 --> 03:57.196
but if you don't do this,
everything is gonna be very quick.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.532
I don't want to
die in the hospital.

03:59.699 --> 04:01.451
I want to die at home.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.832
And what if he doesn't
do the transplant,

04:07.999 --> 04:09.333
what happens then?

04:10.710 --> 04:13.963
You've got two or
three months to live.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.339
It's your choice.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.469
What kind of bullshit
medicine do you practice

04:19.635 --> 04:22.054
that you can't even cure me?!

04:46.120 --> 04:49.290
I want you to know that
if one of us had to die,

04:49.457 --> 04:52.043
I'd rather it were me, not you.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.339
Truth is, if one
of us are gonna die,

04:56.506 --> 04:58.633
it's gonna be me, not you.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.723
I'll tell you another
You're lying.

05:07.058 --> 05:11.437
If one of us has to die, I'd
rather it be you, not me.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.983
I want to stay alive.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.221
And who are you?

07:51.806 --> 07:56.185
I've just been told I
have three months to live.

07:56.352 --> 07:59.814
You won't die 'cause
death doesn't exist.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.115
Let's pray together.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.008
I'm here to celebrate

09:51.175 --> 09:54.845
the union in marriage
of Livia and Diego,

09:55.012 --> 09:59.809
that your bodies and hearts be
one until death do you part.

10:01.060 --> 10:04.647
Livia Monteiro Bueno, is
it of your own free will

10:04.814 --> 10:08.234
that you take Diego to be
your legitimate spouse?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.693
Yes.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.572
Diego Fairman,
is it of your own free will

10:13.739 --> 10:17.201
that you take Livia to be
your legitimate spouse?

10:17.368 --> 10:18.368
Yes.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.080
Considering these affirmations

10:21.247 --> 10:25.584
made by each of you before me,
I declare you man and wife.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.297
- Ooh!
- Ah.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.678
I've known this bastard
since he arrived in Brazil,

10:35.845 --> 10:39.098
and some shit illness is
not going to take away

10:39.265 --> 10:41.433
the finest of our generation.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.270
I know he's gonna beat it.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.813
I propose a toast!

10:48.065 --> 10:50.317
To the groom, to the bride,

10:50.484 --> 10:54.029
that at this moment is
shamelessly getting married.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.329
Livia, my dear,
please, say something.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.457
Say what, that during
my rebellious years,

11:05.624 --> 11:07.209
I did everything I wanted to,

11:07.376 --> 11:09.628
and then some?

11:09.795 --> 11:11.797
And I have no regrets.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.009
But I should confess you
that ever since I was a girl,

11:15.176 --> 11:17.636
I've always dreamed
of a white wedding

11:17.803 --> 11:21.390
with a nice dress and
all the trimmings.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.767
I knew the minute I met
this son of a bitch,

11:23.934 --> 11:26.520
now my husband,
that he was sick.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.025
I abandoned a marriage
and brought with me a son,

11:31.192 --> 11:33.402
our Daniel, to live with him.

11:34.612 --> 11:37.364
And today, he has
made me his wife

11:39.283 --> 11:41.368
and the happiest
woman in the world.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.832
I guess this is my turn.

11:48.417 --> 11:52.171
I'd like to toast to
all of you, my friends,

11:53.881 --> 11:58.844
who, in a way, are characters
in the story of my life.

12:00.471 --> 12:03.933
And of course, I want to toast
this unbearably lovely woman,

12:05.976 --> 12:08.854
who I desire so much, and I
want to make the happiest person

12:09.021 --> 12:13.067
in the world and
fulfill all her dreams.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.443
I love you, Livia.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.361
Woo-hoo.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.363
Woo-hoo.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.530
Yeah!

12:20.574 --> 12:21.408
Woo-hoo!

12:21.575 --> 12:22.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

12:22.534 --> 12:23.369
- yeah, yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

12:23.535 --> 12:24.554
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:24.578 --> 12:27.081
A moment of silence, please.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.296
My love, I have a
confession to make:

12:34.463 --> 12:36.715
I've already cheated on you.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.967
Oh, my god.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.760
That's all right,
I cheated on you too.

13:37.693 --> 13:41.071
I'd like to propose a round of
applause for Dona Sebastiana,

13:41.238 --> 13:43.157
who prepared this
magnificent feast.

13:50.914 --> 13:51.582
I love cooking.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.500
I love it, don't I?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.920
And when I asked my mother
for the recipe, she refused.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.548
That way, she said,
when she died,

13:59.715 --> 14:01.508
I'd have something
to remember her by.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.675
Aww.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.637
Try the Brunello, Diego.

14:05.804 --> 14:09.016
You can feel the nice
long finish it has.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.480
Aromas of rancid olives
and sleepy hazelnuts,

14:14.646 --> 14:18.650
lying on a bed of Roman
cow dung in the moonlight.

14:18.817 --> 14:19.651
96 points.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.569
Robert Parker.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.530
It's good.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.366
Hello, everybody.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.534
Oh, hi.

14:27.701 --> 14:28.535
- Hello.
- Hi, hi.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.954
We're so late, I'm sorry.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.374
You know, we were shooting
just down the street,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.626
but I didn't even
have time to change.

14:35.793 --> 14:36.919
You look beautiful.

14:37.086 --> 14:40.881
We simply couldn't
miss your wedding.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.258
Manuela, those
two, who are they?

14:43.425 --> 14:46.637
Oh, they are that couple
from the soap opera.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.430
They are such stars.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.307
Oh, really?

14:50.474 --> 14:52.601
I propose a toast.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.271
To Antonio, who is
helping his brother Diego

14:56.438 --> 14:57.689
in times of need,

14:59.149 --> 15:03.362
to my mother, who raised
three sons in difficult times,

15:04.655 --> 15:08.367
and to you, Diego, I
hope you come home soon.

15:10.035 --> 15:10.786
To family.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.704
To family.

15:12.871 --> 15:17.084
To your family.

15:17.251 --> 15:21.380
I'd like you to all take
a good look at this man

15:22.214 --> 15:24.591
because I'm going on a trip,

15:25.801 --> 15:28.762
and I'm not sure
there's a way back.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.599
And before I forget,
you can all go to hell.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.455
This is Diego's brother,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.958
to whom he hasn't spoken
for over 10 years,

15:58.125 --> 16:00.711
and he's going to be the donor.

16:01.712 --> 16:05.215
Diego blames him for
their father's death.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.384
He was the favorite son.

16:07.551 --> 16:11.430
He lost everything their
father had, gambling.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.890
That's terrible.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.479
You think he's coming back?

16:18.645 --> 16:19.688
Probably not.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.649
I don't know.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.820
And if he does, it's not
going to be easy for him.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.825
That champagne is really good.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.036
Where does it come from?

16:34.203 --> 16:36.622
It was my wedding present.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.749
Oh, not my farewell present?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.251
You decide.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.711
I decide?

16:42.878 --> 16:43.921
That's a good one.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.966
Hey, Gabi, you
remember that night

16:48.133 --> 16:50.719
we were sitting
around the hotel pool,

16:50.886 --> 16:53.096
and you started screaming

16:53.263 --> 16:55.682
because that naked
German guy slapped you

16:55.849 --> 16:57.209
because you wouldn't
suck his cock?

16:59.770 --> 17:02.397
That night, you really
went up in my esteem.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.734
Come on, Diego, how
little you know me.

17:05.901 --> 17:06.735
I know you.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.445
Yeah, you do.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.322
You know why I
didn't suck his cock?

17:10.489 --> 17:11.573
You tell me.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.076
Yeah, because I don't
like soft cocks, baby.

17:14.243 --> 17:15.744
Don't look at me like that!

17:15.911 --> 17:17.704
I only like hard ones, like you.

17:17.871 --> 17:18.872
Oh, me too, me too.

17:19.039 --> 17:19.831
They work better that way.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.291
Can you believe it?

17:21.458 --> 17:23.627
He says I'm jealous of him.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.671
You think a woman like
me needs to be jealous

17:25.837 --> 17:27.297
of a guy like this?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.507
Ouch.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.717
He's the one who
should be jealous of me.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.054
I heard you have the most
gorgeous breasts in the world,

17:34.221 --> 17:35.347
is it true?

17:35.514 --> 17:37.099
I have, do you want to see?

17:37.266 --> 17:38.326
- No, don't do that.
- Shut up.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.410
- Come on.
- Do you want to see?

17:39.434 --> 17:40.811
Yes or no?

17:40.978 --> 17:41.978
- Come on.
- Yes, I do.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.189
Yes!

17:46.942 --> 17:48.110
All right, all right.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.277
Oh!

17:49.945 --> 17:51.863
- Come on, you're drunk.
- Oh!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.615
All right, all right, all right,

17:53.782 --> 17:55.951
all right, all
right, party's over.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.870
I'll let you have that one.

17:59.037 --> 18:03.041
I know you saw my movie and
I know you didn't like it.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.712
That's why you didn't
say anything, right?

18:06.878 --> 18:11.717
So I'll tell you, you didn't
understand a damn thing.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.760
That's why you have
to see it again.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.096
If you really want
to know, I'll tell you.

18:16.263 --> 18:21.184
I did see it again, and that
screenplay you gave me to read

18:22.019 --> 18:23.770
wasn't the film you made.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.480
The movie you made was more like

18:25.647 --> 18:27.774
a feature-length
mayonnaise commercial.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.653
You're just an ad
man who's gotten rich

18:31.820 --> 18:33.822
selling crap to people
who have nothing to eat.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.116
You say one more word,
I will stand up and leave.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.327
All I want to know is
what are you gonna do

18:38.493 --> 18:41.997
with the tux you bought
to go to the Oscars?

18:43.915 --> 18:46.293
The only reason
I don't beat you up

18:46.460 --> 18:49.796
is because I know
you're gonna die soon.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.801
Did I ever tell you the
one about my uncle Samuel

18:54.968 --> 18:58.138
who went in for heart surgery?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.724
Did I ever tell you the
one about my uncle Samuel

19:00.891 --> 19:02.809
going into heart surgery?

19:06.647 --> 19:08.357
- Tell it, Diego.
- He's a drag.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
Hey.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.085
There's nothing we can do.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.252
I'm scared.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.257
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

19:51.608 --> 19:55.320
Won't you ever deign
to make a film with me?

19:55.487 --> 19:58.156
We find a good
story, we'll do it.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.742
It's my greatest dream.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.329
I would do anything
to be directed by you.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.496
Anything?

20:08.542 --> 20:11.962
Go to the bathroom,
I'll meet you there.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.889
Where's Mother?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.934
She already left with Antonio.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.395
She said you didn't thank him.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.940
I don't know what to say.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.569
I hope things work okay for you.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.959
Hey, little fella.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.296
I married your mother.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.839
What do you think about that?

20:56.006 --> 20:57.466
It was about time.

21:01.386 --> 21:05.390
Your mom and I are
going away tomorrow.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.727
Everything will go
on as usual here.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.437
Dona Sebastiana
will look after you,

21:10.604 --> 21:14.941
and you'll continue to go
to school and play soccer.

21:17.152 --> 21:20.572
I have to go away
because I'm very sick.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.577
Are you going to die?

21:25.744 --> 21:26.744
Maybe.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.880
It's for you.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.979
Hello, good morning.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.941
I'm Dr. Mary Flowers,
your oncologist.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.527
From now on, you're
under my care.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.905
I'll try to explain quickly
what we're going to do.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.574
Right now, we're introducing
a catheter into your thorax

22:04.741 --> 22:06.493
to reach your vena cava.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.745
And from now on, all your
medication and blood tests

22:08.912 --> 22:11.498
will be administered
by this means.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.334
We'll start with a
total body irradiation,

22:14.501 --> 22:17.712
and then induce intensive
chemotherapy treatment.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.799
Our objective is to eliminate
your red and white blood cells

22:20.966 --> 22:23.760
and the platelets already
contaminated with the disease.

22:23.927 --> 22:28.849
Only then, we will be able to
perform the transplant itself.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.160
The donor's cells will
enter your blood stream

22:31.184 --> 22:32.978
and start a battle
with the cancer cells

22:33.144 --> 22:35.272
which survived our treatment.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.066
Out of this entire
shock procedure,

22:38.233 --> 22:40.819
we'll start creating
a new immune system.

22:40.986 --> 22:42.195
Any questions?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.196
No.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.115
So that's the transplant?

22:45.282 --> 22:47.158
It's a matter of
creating a new person

22:47.325 --> 22:49.369
in a body which is
currently sick, yes.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.204
And what about me?

22:52.205 --> 22:53.605
'Cause I've been
here for three days

22:53.748 --> 22:56.042
and no one told me anything.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.213
Oh, you like boxing, huh?

23:02.674 --> 23:03.842
Well, now the bell has rung

23:04.009 --> 23:06.720
and they've taken
away your stool.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.764
We'll take good care of you.

23:09.931 --> 23:10.931
Excuse me.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.016
Thank you.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.687
Good morning.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.731
How are you doing?

23:17.898 --> 23:19.149
Good.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.318
Please, sign here,
authorizing us to use drugs

23:21.484 --> 23:24.112
not yet approved by the FDA.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.197
Are you allergic to anything?

23:26.364 --> 23:27.824
- Yes.
- What?

23:27.991 --> 23:29.117
Boring people.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.039
This other one
exempts this institution

23:34.205 --> 23:36.917
from any responsibility
in case of death.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.126
Ah.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.965
If you are incapacitated or
go into a vegetative state,

23:44.132 --> 23:48.053
whom do you nominate to take
responsibility on your behalf?

23:48.219 --> 23:49.054
Okay.

23:49.220 --> 23:49.846
Thank you very much.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.013
Have a good one.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.139
Thank you.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.100
The risks of infection

23:54.267 --> 23:55.912
during a bone marrow
transplant are very high.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.229
And an infection is not
something we'd want just now.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.899
I'm Dr. Isaac, your
infectious disease specialist.

24:01.066 --> 24:01.858
- Okay.
- And I'll be supervising

24:02.025 --> 24:03.234
- your case.
- Yeah.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.051
Mm.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.219
Looks like we have
a Peeping Tom here.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.514
Stop it.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.062
Uh-huh.

26:03.772 --> 26:05.065
Ah.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.233
Yes, we do, yes, we do.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.409
Good morning, I'm Dr. Morris.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.119
This is my assistant, Virginia.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.120
Good morning.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.831
She's going to install this bag

26:21.998 --> 26:24.125
with a morphine-based analgesic,

26:24.292 --> 26:27.629
which regulates the dosage that
will keep you free of pain.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.798
If you feel any pain,
you just use the pump,

26:29.964 --> 26:32.258
and you increase the
amount you receive.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.635
On a scale of one to 10,

26:33.802 --> 26:36.721
how much pain you'd say
you're feeling right now?

26:36.888 --> 26:39.474
I'd say 10 so I
can use the pump.

26:39.641 --> 26:40.841
Yeah, then we have a problem

26:40.934 --> 26:43.061
because the treatment
hasn't even started.

26:43.228 --> 26:46.606
And once it does,
don't get too excited.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.233
Machine is regulated to a limit,

26:48.399 --> 26:51.236
since an overdose might
cause you a heart attack.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.863
If the pain persists, well,
we'll have to give you

26:54.030 --> 26:58.451
something stronger which
will leave you unconscious.

26:58.618 --> 27:02.914
And please, don't hesitate
to send for me anytime.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.333
Dr. Morris, pain and drugs.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.171
We're removing a
sample of your bone marrow

27:10.338 --> 27:14.134
to know whether it is
contaminated with cancerous cells.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.970
I've applied a local anesthesia
that works subcutaneously,

27:17.137 --> 27:19.639
but it doesn't work on the bone.

27:23.184 --> 27:24.394
You'll feel a strong pinch,

27:24.561 --> 27:26.896
so I want you to take
a deep and slow breath.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.063
Okay.

27:28.815 --> 27:29.899
Here we go.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.284
Almost there.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.330
Hold on.

27:44.497 --> 27:49.335
Hold on, second pass.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.730
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

28:55.276 --> 28:56.716
The red and
white blood cell counts

28:56.778 --> 28:58.571
are practically zero.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.365
The donor has reacted very well

29:00.531 --> 29:02.533
to the production
accelerators of cells

29:02.700 --> 29:04.494
that will be used
for his transplant.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.037
Everything's going fine.

29:06.204 --> 29:08.039
What's this
treatment you're giving me?

29:08.206 --> 29:10.750
'Cause all I do is sleep.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.295
Oh, that's perfectly normal.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.590
I see him in
so much pain at night,

29:17.757 --> 29:20.802
and I'm not sure if he
understands what I'm saying.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.971
I think he does.

29:29.269 --> 29:32.063
Mr. Fairman, I'm
Dr. Mary Flowers.

29:35.525 --> 29:36.734
We're here looking after you.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.612
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

29:48.162 --> 29:50.123
See, he does understand.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.127
That's about it.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.421
All we can do now is wait.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.893
I've got to think of my family.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.022
I have children to raise.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.565
So, what if I die?

30:18.651 --> 30:20.987
I am a real estate
agent in the suburbs.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.282
My brother is a
famous movie director.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.575
You're crazy.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.827
You don't know what
you're talking about.

30:27.994 --> 30:31.497
You know he's going to die if
we don't do the transplant.

30:31.664 --> 30:32.707
I don't care.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.835
He doesn't talk to me.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.754
To this day, he blames
for father's death.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.799
Now that he needs me, he
remembers that I exist.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.636
I already told you, I
want a million dollars,

30:45.803 --> 30:48.014
or I'm going home tomorrow.

30:48.181 --> 30:52.226
I want a check of a
million in my wife's hands,

30:52.393 --> 30:53.686
or I'm not doing the transplant.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.733
But you know we don't
have that sort of money.

30:55.772 --> 30:56.606
You know that.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.483
What do you mean?

30:58.649 --> 31:01.652
How much that house
you live in worth?

31:55.957 --> 31:58.251
Who the fuck are you?

31:58.418 --> 31:59.627
Out.

31:59.794 --> 32:00.794
Out, out!

32:33.911 --> 32:35.329
Are you crazy?

32:36.873 --> 32:41.002
I can't understand where all
this hatred is coming from.

32:41.169 --> 32:44.380
We grew up together,
we shared everything.

32:44.547 --> 32:47.467
We're blood brothers
for God's sake.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.512
All that he has, he worked for.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.556
He never stole anything.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.435
We've reduced
the morphine dosage,

32:57.602 --> 32:59.187
which was very high.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.814
He'll feel pain again, but
there's nothing we can do.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.317
At high levels, the
morphine can cause

33:04.484 --> 33:05.776
a lack of oxygen in his blood

33:05.943 --> 33:09.947
and this may lead to a
cardio respiratory arrest.

34:39.662 --> 34:41.080
I got the money.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.585
Tomorrow, it'll be
in your wife's hands.

34:46.919 --> 34:50.798
But think about it, what's
your brother going to think

34:50.965 --> 34:52.125
when he finds out you charged

34:52.258 --> 34:55.094
a million dollars
to save his life?

35:15.615 --> 35:16.991
Mind if I smoke?

35:21.954 --> 35:24.040
First time in the States?

35:27.835 --> 35:28.836
No.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.882
Been here many times.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.928
How'd you find
out you were sick?

35:38.095 --> 35:40.806
I was having dinner
with some friends,

35:40.973 --> 35:42.933
one of their wives was a doctor.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.770
She saw something ugly
on my neck and she said,

35:45.936 --> 35:47.313
"I don't like this.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.359
When they finished
the procedure,

35:51.525 --> 35:54.654
it was much bigger
than they expected.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.908
They put me to sleep
and when I woke up,

36:00.326 --> 36:03.871
there was a doctor there
telling me it was very serious.

36:04.038 --> 36:06.290
It's just like that.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.750
Always the same.

36:09.001 --> 36:12.338
You never know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

36:12.505 --> 36:13.631
Who are you?

36:14.882 --> 36:16.759
I came to take you.

36:17.802 --> 36:19.887
Take me, where?

36:25.935 --> 36:28.562
What if I told you
I don't want to go?

36:28.729 --> 36:29.748
That's what they all say.

36:29.772 --> 36:31.816
What am I supposed to do?

36:38.072 --> 36:40.991
- What I'd like to
know is: Why me?

36:42.368 --> 36:44.078
There's no logic.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.747
Maybe someone denounced you.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.332
I just obey orders.

36:53.337 --> 36:56.632
I'd like to speak
to your supervisor.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.762
Sounds like you want
to complicate things.

37:01.929 --> 37:06.475
But I should tell you, if
you don't come with me now,

37:06.642 --> 37:10.271
old age is pretty
ridiculous and undignified.

37:13.649 --> 37:15.818
Who do you work for?

37:15.985 --> 37:17.611
A multinational enterprise.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.488
We are market leaders.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.492
Market, what market is that?

37:23.659 --> 37:24.659
Market.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.621
The market is the market.

37:27.788 --> 37:31.000
And who invented that market?

37:32.001 --> 37:35.671
The market was created
by the market itself.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.467
Back to the caveman days,

37:39.633 --> 37:42.845
when a man exchanged
something with another man,

37:43.012 --> 37:45.514
they created the market.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.142
And profit drives the market.

37:49.393 --> 37:54.023
And you cannot argue with
that because profit is sacred.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.942
God's behind everything.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.198
I don't get extra money
for philosophy classes.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.364
Shall we?

38:06.118 --> 38:09.705
I'd like to brush my
teeth before leaving.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.082
You mind?

38:38.484 --> 38:39.819
And who is she?

38:41.195 --> 38:43.113
Oh, that's Sissy.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.824
My little girl.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.035
She's been with me
since she was born.

38:48.202 --> 38:50.120
She looks very
much like her mother.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.083
Everyone tells me that.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.334
Same eyes.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.139
August the 6th.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.641
Remember the date well.

39:10.808 --> 39:14.728
From now on, it's going
to be your new birthday.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.566
And now, what do I do?

39:20.234 --> 39:21.986
There's nothing you can do.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.779
Now it's up to him.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.090
This woman, who is she?

39:44.341 --> 39:45.634
I don't know.

39:47.803 --> 39:52.808
It's a woman who follows me
around the whole goddamn time.

39:53.475 --> 39:54.475
She's stuck on me.

39:56.270 --> 39:58.689
I never told her "I love you"

39:58.856 --> 40:02.151
and I never said to
her "I don't love you."

40:02.318 --> 40:05.404
Since we're gonna
be together forever,

40:05.571 --> 40:07.615
could you tell me
where we're heading

40:07.781 --> 40:09.384
- after we leave here?
- Hold on, wait a second.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.826
Who said forever?

40:12.286 --> 40:15.664
Is there something else that
you don't want to tell me?

40:15.831 --> 40:17.374
I just don't know.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.629
They never told me,
and I never asked.

40:23.505 --> 40:27.718
Look, I'm only doing this
because it's steady work, right?

40:27.885 --> 40:30.262
I get my paycheck,
vacation, and, this year,

40:30.429 --> 40:34.099
a bonus trip to
Disneyland for good work.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.060
What does "good work" mean?

40:37.061 --> 40:38.395
Cannot say.

40:38.562 --> 40:39.772
Not authorized.

40:40.940 --> 40:45.027
My contract has a
confidentiality clause.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.362
I just do my job.

40:46.528 --> 40:50.574
I show up, no questions,
don't talk to anyone.

40:50.741 --> 40:51.867
When my boss arrives,

40:52.034 --> 40:53.744
I hide so I don't have
to say good morning.

40:53.911 --> 40:55.829
I'm afraid he'll fire me.

40:57.331 --> 41:01.168
I spend hours staring at
the wall outside my window.

41:01.335 --> 41:04.254
When they remember me, they
ask me to go and fetch someone.

41:04.421 --> 41:07.132
You know, it's a job
I'd rather not do.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.969
Why do you do it, then?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.055
You have a family to support?

41:13.222 --> 41:16.266
I have no family,
no house, no one.

41:20.938 --> 41:25.734
I have a son, but we had a
fight and we don't talk anymore.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.780
I think he's a skydiver.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.996
I just have this
extremely jealous woman

41:37.162 --> 41:39.206
who always wants
to know what I do,

41:39.373 --> 41:40.833
who I talk to, where I go.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.002
You know how women are, right?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.168
I guess so.

41:45.295 --> 41:46.005
I'm a happy man.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.589
What about you?

41:47.756 --> 41:48.756
Me?

41:49.883 --> 41:51.218
Only on Mondays.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.805
What do you do?

41:54.972 --> 41:57.433
I'm a film director.

41:57.599 --> 41:58.599
Wow.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.185
Wow.

42:01.812 --> 42:02.812
Super.

42:04.523 --> 42:05.899
Are you famous?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.027
I used to be.

42:10.070 --> 42:13.741
In my town, there was a
cinema, but I never went.

42:13.907 --> 42:16.410
Now, it's an evangelical church.

42:17.369 --> 42:19.163
Do you play chess?

42:25.294 --> 42:27.713
Doctor, he's back.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.966
Say something, my love.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.181
What's happening?

42:37.347 --> 42:40.559
Does he have a fever,
is he cold, what is it?

42:40.726 --> 42:43.270
Would you get
some warm blankets, please?

42:43.437 --> 42:44.646
What's going on?

42:44.813 --> 42:46.053
We have to stop this infection

42:46.106 --> 42:47.399
as quickly as possible.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.652
So, we'll be starting on a
broad-spectrum antibiotic,

42:50.819 --> 42:53.697
and take him to intensive
care immediately.

43:23.352 --> 43:25.062
His blood pressure's falling.

43:25.229 --> 43:27.940
The oxygen level is very low,
and his heartbeat is weak.

43:28.107 --> 43:30.192
We're unable to
contain the infection,

43:30.359 --> 43:31.735
and we may lose the patient.

44:01.473 --> 44:05.811
I'm Dr. Feffer and I'm
Jewish, as I believe you are.

44:07.980 --> 44:11.400
My whole family died
in the Warsaw ghetto,

44:13.235 --> 44:16.572
and I was brought up in
an orphanage in London,

44:16.738 --> 44:19.241
where I graduated in medicine.

44:20.409 --> 44:22.452
I emigrated to
the United States,

44:22.619 --> 44:26.373
and I'm one of the
founders of this institute.

44:26.540 --> 44:29.501
We've won a Nobel Prize for
our research into blood.

44:29.668 --> 44:32.671
So, here, we believe
only in science.

44:34.423 --> 44:38.760
But my years of experience as
a doctor have also taught me

44:38.927 --> 44:42.931
that those who still
have a dream to fulfill,

44:43.098 --> 44:45.684
have a better
chance of survival.

44:49.104 --> 44:50.439
So dark here.

44:50.606 --> 44:52.399
Can I turn on the light?

45:19.801 --> 45:21.220
You like soccer?

45:26.016 --> 45:27.142
Not really.

45:28.310 --> 45:29.394
And you?

45:29.561 --> 45:32.189
I did when I was a boy.

45:32.356 --> 45:33.982
I was the goalkeeper.

45:35.442 --> 45:37.152
But one day, the ball
hit me in the face,

45:37.319 --> 45:38.070
and I quit that shit.

45:38.237 --> 45:40.030
Never wanted to play again.

45:40.197 --> 45:41.990
That makes two of us.

45:43.533 --> 45:46.453
Tell me, is there
life after death?

45:49.414 --> 45:52.042
As I told you, I know nothing.

46:11.270 --> 46:15.899
I lied to you when I said
I'd never been to the cinema.

46:16.066 --> 46:18.360
I saw a film of yours.

46:18.527 --> 46:20.529
Do you remember which one?

46:20.696 --> 46:23.448
Well, I don't remember the name,

46:23.615 --> 46:27.536
but I never forgot a scene
with a big boy sitting,

46:29.663 --> 46:33.667
fully dressed, in a woman's
arms, being breastfed.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.589
Can I ask you something?

46:41.049 --> 46:44.720
Would it be too much to ask you
to fetch me some other time?

46:44.886 --> 46:48.015
I still want to
make one more film.

46:48.181 --> 46:50.475
What film is that?

46:50.642 --> 46:52.227
Is it a film to badmouth me?

46:52.394 --> 46:54.938
No, I have nothing against you.

46:55.105 --> 46:56.523
I just don't want to die.

46:56.690 --> 46:59.484
I still want to
make another film.

47:02.529 --> 47:04.948
Can't you take someone else?

47:09.036 --> 47:11.288
I've enjoyed meeting you.

47:12.539 --> 47:16.501
Never had a chance to
meet an artist before.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.253
You're real people.

47:20.547 --> 47:22.632
You're someone like us.

47:26.053 --> 47:28.597
I'll say I couldn't find you.

49:32.387 --> 49:34.389
Oh, this waiting is hell.

49:36.308 --> 49:38.518
No, no, we don't know yet.

49:40.770 --> 49:41.770
It's serious.

49:44.191 --> 49:46.067
Yes, that might happen.

49:49.321 --> 49:51.656
You mean 83, 84?

49:51.823 --> 49:52.949
Exactly.

49:53.116 --> 49:54.326
Queen at the Hyde Park?

49:54.493 --> 49:56.369
- Yeah.
- I was there too.

49:56.536 --> 49:58.955
It's an amazing coincidence.

49:59.122 --> 50:01.082
What were you doing
in London back then?

50:01.249 --> 50:04.169
I was studying at the
Royal School of Visual Arts.

50:04.336 --> 50:05.837
That's right, that's right.

50:06.004 --> 50:07.130
You know what?

50:07.297 --> 50:09.883
Maybe you could show
me a photo someday.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.676
Why don't we have some coffee?

50:27.192 --> 50:29.611
Have you spoken to Daniel?

50:42.249 --> 50:44.501
So that Dr. Pain and Drugs,

50:46.545 --> 50:48.713
you find him charming?

50:48.880 --> 50:50.882
Never thought about it.

50:53.218 --> 50:54.511
Would you really fuck a guy

50:54.678 --> 50:57.681
that wears a Donald
Duck pattern tie?

51:01.518 --> 51:06.481
I don't know, but I could
give it a try and let you know.

51:07.816 --> 51:11.111
It's been so long that I've
forgotten what it's like.

51:34.342 --> 51:36.428
No more running for him.

51:36.595 --> 51:37.595
Diego.

52:34.194 --> 52:35.236
Mm, mm, mm.

52:35.403 --> 52:36.404
Mm.

52:37.989 --> 52:38.823
Mm.

52:38.990 --> 52:40.241
Look, look.

52:40.408 --> 52:41.534
Look.

52:41.701 --> 52:42.701
You see?

52:49.292 --> 52:50.292
There.

52:51.419 --> 52:53.296
It doesn't hurt at all.

52:54.631 --> 52:56.007
He's not crying.

52:58.426 --> 52:59.719
Yeah, all done.

53:36.297 --> 53:37.799
What's your name?

54:02.490 --> 54:06.745
This is my town, and I don't
want you sleeping in a hotel.

54:06.911 --> 54:09.372
While you're here, I want
you to be comfortable.

54:09.539 --> 54:13.793
I've made all the arrangements,
you're staying at our place.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.879
You'll have everything you need.

54:16.045 --> 54:19.257
Just wait until you see what
we've done with your bedroom.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.926
I'm so happy you're coming.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.428
You're gonna love it.

54:23.595 --> 54:26.097
On Friday, we're
organizing a charity dinner

54:26.264 --> 54:28.224
for the children of Africa.

54:28.391 --> 54:30.810
Hey, they've just
got outta hospital.

54:30.977 --> 54:32.729
Give them a break.

54:32.896 --> 54:35.398
It's always the same with you.

54:35.565 --> 54:38.943
I can't say a god damn word
without him getting mad at me.

54:39.110 --> 54:43.865
I mean, it's so revolting
that while we have so much,

54:44.032 --> 54:46.034
there are millions
of children in Africa

54:46.201 --> 54:47.619
who haven't enough to eat,

54:47.786 --> 54:50.580
which is why I decided
to have this dinner,

54:50.747 --> 54:53.082
to raise funds to help them.

54:53.249 --> 54:54.876
Leslie, he's an artist.

54:55.043 --> 54:56.878
Stop bugging him with politics.

54:57.045 --> 54:58.963
But it's not about politics.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.841
It's about starving children.

55:02.008 --> 55:05.011
Each guest will pay
$10,000 not to eat.

55:06.930 --> 55:08.932
Five meals will be served,

55:09.098 --> 55:12.268
and each meal you miss,
you pay another 2,000.

55:12.435 --> 55:15.355
My idea is that at
the end of the dinner,

55:15.522 --> 55:17.899
you'll feel so hungry
that you'll actually know

55:18.066 --> 55:20.109
what those kids
are going through.

55:20.276 --> 55:22.111
And that will give you the right

55:22.278 --> 55:25.406
to sponsor a child
who'll then write to you,

55:25.573 --> 55:30.495
and the money will pay for
his basic needs and education.

55:31.162 --> 55:32.455
Just listen to this.

56:02.068 --> 56:03.152
This way.

56:14.122 --> 56:16.833
From now on, this is your home.

56:18.793 --> 56:22.213
Let's go see the room
I got ready for you.

56:32.599 --> 56:34.058
Huh?

56:34.225 --> 56:35.393
How about that?

56:36.269 --> 56:38.479
I bought it in an auction.

56:39.689 --> 56:41.065
It's from the set
of a '30s movie

56:41.232 --> 56:44.027
with Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire.

56:44.193 --> 56:45.403
Hope you like it.

56:47.614 --> 56:51.284
You are one bighearted
son of a bitch.

56:51.451 --> 56:52.451
Thank you.

57:07.926 --> 57:11.846
The first film I ever
saw, I was about your age.

57:12.013 --> 57:14.641
It was a black and white film.

57:14.807 --> 57:17.477
It was night, a frightened girl

57:17.644 --> 57:19.062
was running along
a deserted breach,

57:19.228 --> 57:23.441
and she was looking behind her
like someone was chasing her.

57:23.608 --> 57:25.652
She wore a tight sweater,

57:27.153 --> 57:31.866
a black belt, and a full skirt
which billowed in the wind.

57:33.993 --> 57:36.496
There was a group
of boys in a car.

57:36.663 --> 57:39.707
They were drinking,
laughing, shouting.

57:39.874 --> 57:43.044
She was running
away, scared of them.

57:43.211 --> 57:45.797
Their car got closer and closer,

57:45.964 --> 57:48.174
and then she fell, exhausted.

57:50.343 --> 57:52.095
The car circled around her,

57:52.261 --> 57:55.181
the boys were
laughing and shouting.

57:55.348 --> 57:58.101
And then the car stopped.

57:58.267 --> 58:00.770
And one of the boys went to her.

58:02.271 --> 58:04.899
She started crying, desperately.

58:06.484 --> 58:08.277
Sitting in the sand.

58:13.783 --> 58:16.035
And what happened to her?

58:19.789 --> 58:21.165
You know, I don't remember,

58:21.332 --> 58:25.086
but I do remember that
when she got home,

58:25.253 --> 58:27.255
she went in the backdoor.

58:28.089 --> 58:29.549
She went in and saw her parents

58:29.716 --> 58:31.236
watching television
in the living room,

58:31.342 --> 58:33.177
and then she crept
upstairs to her bedroom

58:33.344 --> 58:35.263
so she wouldn't be seen.

friend of mine had died

59:15.344 --> 59:18.264
and was resuscitated, and
they were just so excited.

59:18.431 --> 59:19.533
They were dying to meet you.

he's the head of the

Judith Salton, Yuri Yernikov,

This is Mitzy who runs

And, of course, here,
this is Jack McDowell,

59:38.409 --> 59:40.995
his grandfather started
the BBA network here,

59:41.162 --> 59:44.040
and his father was
fucking Marilyn Monroe.

59:45.458 --> 59:47.960
Is what Leslie told us true?

59:49.670 --> 59:51.506
I don't know what
you're talking about.

59:51.672 --> 59:53.549
Didn't you go
there and come back?

59:53.716 --> 59:54.759
Go where?

59:54.926 --> 59:57.345
Didn't you die and come back?

59:59.013 --> 1:00:02.100
Yes, I did die, but
only for an instant.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:03.351
What is it like there?

1:00:03.518 --> 1:00:05.311
Anything you can tell us?

1:00:06.979 --> 1:00:08.356
I didn't get to heaven.

1:00:08.523 --> 1:00:11.067
I only got as far as purgatory.

1:00:11.234 --> 1:00:14.320
That's where they judge
what we do on Earth.

1:00:14.487 --> 1:00:18.282
Those who don't help their
neighbors, go to a small room

1:00:18.449 --> 1:00:21.035
with on windows or
air conditioning.

1:00:21.202 --> 1:00:24.122
But those who
helped the starving,

1:00:24.288 --> 1:00:26.874
they get a suite with air
conditioning and a minibar.

1:00:28.209 --> 1:00:30.378
And what's the
weather like up there?

1:00:30.545 --> 1:00:31.879
It's hot.

1:00:32.046 --> 1:00:33.047
But is there a breeze?

1:00:33.214 --> 1:00:34.674
Mm, from time to time.

1:00:34.841 --> 1:00:38.594
Are the Jews mixed
in with everyone else?

1:00:38.761 --> 1:00:41.264
I don't know, I never saw one.

1:00:41.430 --> 1:00:43.015
But if you want to go shopping,

1:00:43.182 --> 1:00:44.600
do they take American Express?

1:00:44.767 --> 1:00:47.228
You're better off taking cash.

1:00:47.395 --> 1:00:49.230
May we take a picture with you?

1:00:49.397 --> 1:00:50.857
Okay, if we can do it quickly.

1:00:51.023 --> 1:00:52.023
Please.

1:00:53.776 --> 1:00:55.695
Get in your spots.

1:00:55.862 --> 1:00:57.446
Okay.

1:00:57.613 --> 1:00:58.698
Smile.

1:00:58.865 --> 1:00:59.865
Cheers.

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:01.701
- Ah!
- Ah!

1:01:01.868 --> 1:01:03.035
Great.

1:01:03.202 --> 1:01:04.453
Fantastic.

1:01:04.620 --> 1:01:05.788
- Leslie.
- Yeah?

1:01:05.955 --> 1:01:07.290
Annie from "Vanity Fair"

1:01:07.456 --> 1:01:08.776
- is looking for you.
- Oh, great.

1:01:08.916 --> 1:01:09.959
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1:01:10.126 --> 1:01:11.126
Come on, everyone.

1:01:11.252 --> 1:01:13.379
- Yes, we're coming.
- Come on.

1:01:13.546 --> 1:01:14.797
Okay.

1:01:16.007 --> 1:01:17.300
- Got her, thank you.
- Oh.

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:18.466
Excuse me.

1:01:18.593 --> 1:01:19.886
Was God there?

1:01:20.052 --> 1:01:22.889
No, he was at his AA meeting.

1:01:23.055 --> 1:01:24.056
Oh.

1:01:24.223 --> 1:01:27.476
♪ Away, away, away ♪

1:01:32.398 --> 1:01:35.234
♪ I want to fly ♪

1:01:36.110 --> 1:01:38.321
We're in Russia.

1:01:38.487 --> 1:01:41.532
Everything is covered with snow.

1:01:41.699 --> 1:01:43.659
There's a strong wind.

1:01:47.455 --> 1:01:51.125
In the distance, we
see a little house

1:01:51.292 --> 1:01:55.254
and there's a bright yellow
light coming from the window.

1:01:55.421 --> 1:01:56.839
A door bangs loudly.

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:03.221
In the bedroom, a baby
sleeps in his crib.

1:02:04.430 --> 1:02:07.266
Nice and warm,
under his blanket,

1:02:07.433 --> 1:02:10.853
he's thinking of his
pony who must be cold.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:14.732
He crawls down the stairs
and he goes outside.

1:02:16.317 --> 1:02:20.863
Crawls through the snow and
all the way to the stable,

1:02:21.030 --> 1:02:25.117
where he sees his pony
lying in the straw,

1:02:25.284 --> 1:02:28.371
looking up at him,
freezing to death.

1:02:28.537 --> 1:02:30.331
He covers him.

1:02:30.498 --> 1:02:34.418
He turns to go back, but
he can't find the house

1:02:35.795 --> 1:02:38.381
because it's covered with snow.

1:02:38.547 --> 1:02:40.591
He has nowhere to go.

1:02:40.758 --> 1:02:41.758
He's lost.

1:02:42.593 --> 1:02:46.472
He finds a path,
starts to crawl on it,

1:02:46.639 --> 1:02:49.809
faster and faster
because it's so cold.

1:02:50.768 --> 1:02:52.520
And then, all of the sudden,

1:02:52.687 --> 1:02:54.605
he sees the light of the sun

1:02:54.772 --> 1:02:57.900
coming up from
behind the village.

1:02:58.067 --> 1:03:02.530
He crawls all the way to
the village, very hungry.

1:03:02.697 --> 1:03:04.615
He crawls down the
deserted main street

1:03:04.782 --> 1:03:07.660
until he gets to the bakery.

1:03:07.827 --> 1:03:10.746
He goes in, and
there, he looks up

1:03:10.913 --> 1:03:15.209
and he sees a frightening
man with a mustache who says,

1:03:15.376 --> 1:03:17.837
"What do you want, little boy?"

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:20.881
"I'm hungry.

1:03:21.048 --> 1:03:24.176
"I'd like a bottle
of hot chocolate."

1:03:24.343 --> 1:03:27.972
"Do you have any
money?" the man says.

1:03:28.139 --> 1:03:28.889
"No."

1:03:29.056 --> 1:03:31.600
"Well, if you have no money,

1:03:31.767 --> 1:03:33.978
"then you must go
someplace else.

1:03:34.145 --> 1:03:37.481
"We have no hot
chocolate for you here."

1:03:40.443 --> 1:03:44.530
And then, all of the
sudden, his father comes in,

1:03:45.406 --> 1:03:47.199
picks his son up in his arms,

1:03:47.366 --> 1:03:51.329
and placing a 10-ruble bill
on the counter, he says,

1:03:51.495 --> 1:03:54.040
"I want you to get a nice bottle

1:03:54.206 --> 1:03:56.709
"of hot chocolate for my son."

1:04:08.095 --> 1:04:10.431
You're being well-looked after.

1:04:10.598 --> 1:04:12.224
Your mother's here,

1:04:12.391 --> 1:04:14.310
your friends are taking
good care of you,

1:04:14.477 --> 1:04:16.979
you don't need me anymore, okay?

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:49.970
We're at war, we're at sea.

1:04:51.639 --> 1:04:52.932
The sea is rough.

1:04:54.475 --> 1:04:56.685
Bombs light up the dark sky.

1:04:58.187 --> 1:05:01.065
One of the German bombs
hits our aircraft carrier.

1:05:05.611 --> 1:05:07.279
Men, in the lifeboats!

1:05:07.446 --> 1:05:08.572
Jump into the lifeboat!

1:05:08.739 --> 1:05:11.867
All right!

1:05:12.034 --> 1:05:15.037
Row, row, row fast!

1:05:15.204 --> 1:05:16.580
But faster!

1:05:16.747 --> 1:05:17.581
Okay!

1:05:17.748 --> 1:05:19.166
Faster, faster.

1:05:19.333 --> 1:05:21.127
I can't row any faster.

1:05:22.670 --> 1:05:25.464
Wake up, you silly old man.

1:05:25.631 --> 1:05:26.631
Okay.

1:05:27.466 --> 1:05:29.885
Oh, look, the bright sunlight.

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:32.179
Look, a big wave.

1:05:32.346 --> 1:05:33.639
Send us to the sea.

1:05:33.806 --> 1:05:35.307
Oh, wonderful.

1:05:35.474 --> 1:05:36.767
To the shore.

1:05:36.934 --> 1:05:38.769
Wade to the beach.

1:05:38.936 --> 1:05:43.566
Put your weapon above your
head, so it doesn't get wet.

1:05:47.528 --> 1:05:48.528
Ho, ho, ho!

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:52.741
Grenade ready?

1:05:54.827 --> 1:05:55.827
Throw it!

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:02.293
Get low, get low!

1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:04.211
All right, let's attack!

1:06:04.378 --> 1:06:05.546
Attack!

1:06:05.713 --> 1:06:06.881
Okay, I'll get you covered!

1:06:07.047 --> 1:06:08.048
Go, go, go!

1:06:08.215 --> 1:06:10.009
Go, go, go, I'll
get you covered!

1:06:16.056 --> 1:06:17.056
We killed them.

1:06:20.644 --> 1:06:21.896
Better them than us, right?

1:06:22.062 --> 1:06:22.688
Yes!

1:06:22.855 --> 1:06:24.356
All right.

1:06:24.523 --> 1:06:26.567
All right there, partner.

1:06:27.776 --> 1:06:29.570
I grew up in Argentina,

1:06:29.737 --> 1:06:32.698
in a seaside town
called Mar Del Plata.

1:06:33.699 --> 1:06:34.909
The town faced the sea

1:06:35.075 --> 1:06:37.495
and filled up with
tourists in the summer.

1:06:37.661 --> 1:06:39.747
In the winter, it was deserted.

1:06:39.914 --> 1:06:41.457
You could walk through
the dark streets

1:06:41.624 --> 1:06:43.876
without seeing a soul.

1:06:44.043 --> 1:06:45.669
It was like a ghost town.

1:06:45.836 --> 1:06:48.339
Look what I made you: strudel.

1:06:49.590 --> 1:06:51.967
I remembered, you
like it with tea.

1:06:52.134 --> 1:06:55.221
Mom, can't you see I'm writing?

1:06:55.387 --> 1:06:56.722
Please, go away.

1:06:59.934 --> 1:07:00.934
Mom.

1:07:01.894 --> 1:07:04.647
I already told you,
leave me alone, please.

1:07:04.813 --> 1:07:05.813
I'm working.

1:07:12.571 --> 1:07:13.811
When I'd get home from school,

1:07:13.906 --> 1:07:16.283
after lunch, I used
to move the hands

1:07:16.450 --> 1:07:18.786
of the kitchen
clock to 3:00 p.m.,

1:07:18.953 --> 1:07:21.664
the time of the first
show at the cinema.

1:07:21.830 --> 1:07:25.793
But when I got there, the
cinema was still closed,

1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:30.881
so I'd look at the movie
posters, imagining their stories.

1:07:31.715 --> 1:07:33.634
One night, returning home,

1:07:33.801 --> 1:07:37.263
I saw a bright light at
the end of the street.

1:07:37.429 --> 1:07:40.683
When I got closer, I saw
a long track on the ground

1:07:40.849 --> 1:07:43.394
with an enormous
camera mounted on top,

1:07:43.561 --> 1:07:45.354
coming in my direction.

1:07:46.814 --> 1:07:49.733
On the far side of the
camera, it was pouring rain,

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:53.070
and there was a man with
a long raincoat and a hat,

1:07:53.237 --> 1:07:55.781
soaking wet, cigarette
in his mouth,

1:07:55.948 --> 1:07:58.951
walking alongside the camera
towards a mysterious woman

1:07:59.118 --> 1:08:01.412
waiting for him in the rain.

1:08:02.830 --> 1:08:07.626
When he reached her, the camera
stopped and moved closer.

1:08:09.003 --> 1:08:12.798
She started crying and then
she kissed him passionately.

1:09:28.499 --> 1:09:31.377
The play's main
character was my age,

1:09:31.543 --> 1:09:33.837
and was saying goodbye
to his mother and sister

1:09:34.004 --> 1:09:37.675
through a window,
without being heard.

1:09:37.841 --> 1:09:41.679
He told them to forgive
him for abandoning them.

1:09:41.845 --> 1:09:46.141
But that he had to leave,
otherwise he'd stay forever.

1:09:48.143 --> 1:09:51.146
The next day, I
took a bus and left,

1:09:52.314 --> 1:09:55.317
and I only came
back 20 years later.

1:11:36.418 --> 1:11:39.713
It's good to have
you back home, sir.

1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:42.216
Good to see you too, Ademir.

1:15:02.874 --> 1:15:07.838
I'm doing research with HIV
prisoners in Carandiru jail.

1:15:09.047 --> 1:15:11.466
One cell, made for
four, there are 17.

1:15:13.135 --> 1:15:15.345
Sex and drugs are nonstop.

1:15:16.388 --> 1:15:18.682
A needle is used on
at least four arms,

1:15:18.849 --> 1:15:22.269
and rates of infection are high.

1:15:22.436 --> 1:15:26.273
They have sex in jail, are
infected, and then on Sundays,

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:31.403
they see their wives for
conjugal visits, and infect them.

1:15:32.237 --> 1:15:34.656
You should write about that.

1:15:40.454 --> 1:15:43.331
Don't you think it's a
supremely insignificant

1:15:43.498 --> 1:15:46.293
in the history of humanity
that you ran eight seconds

1:15:46.460 --> 1:15:49.504
faster than you
did 20 years ago?

1:15:49.671 --> 1:15:53.175
We're never gonna have another
Fellini film, think of that.

1:15:53.341 --> 1:15:55.052
That's what matters.

1:15:58.513 --> 1:16:00.098
Today, I tripped on the street,

1:16:00.265 --> 1:16:01.534
fell down and
couldn't get up again.

1:16:01.558 --> 1:16:03.268
I had to ask for help.

1:16:06.313 --> 1:16:10.192
I never felt so
humiliated in all my life.

1:16:10.358 --> 1:16:12.611
I can't take care
of you the whole time.

1:16:12.778 --> 1:16:15.363
I don't need you
to take care of me.

1:16:15.530 --> 1:16:16.865
Well, that's great to know now

1:16:17.032 --> 1:16:20.035
'cause that's what I've
been doing all these years.

1:16:20.202 --> 1:16:23.121
It was you, your
work, your illness.

1:16:24.289 --> 1:16:27.209
I've always stood beside you.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:31.421
Do you mean you no longer
want to be beside me?

1:16:33.256 --> 1:16:36.051
I'm not answering that question.

1:16:37.886 --> 1:16:42.057
I thought that if I stood
beside you, you'd survive.

1:16:42.224 --> 1:16:44.309
It was at the hospital
that I realized

1:16:44.476 --> 1:16:47.020
that your life didn't
depend on my love.

1:16:47.187 --> 1:16:48.438
And that freed me.

1:16:48.605 --> 1:16:50.398
Your life belongs only to you.

1:16:50.565 --> 1:16:52.317
Now I have to take care of mine.

1:16:52.484 --> 1:16:53.944
You're just saying that

1:16:54.111 --> 1:16:56.363
because we haven't fucked
for five years, aren't you?

1:16:56.530 --> 1:16:57.781
Come on.

1:16:57.948 --> 1:17:01.118
And I thought that
your understanding

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:05.872
was the greatest demonstration
of love you could give me.

1:17:08.333 --> 1:17:09.918
Seeing someone?

1:17:10.085 --> 1:17:11.211
You want to leave me?

1:17:11.378 --> 1:17:12.522
You haven't understood a thing.

1:17:12.546 --> 1:17:13.546
Tell the truth.

1:17:13.672 --> 1:17:14.464
That's what you miss, isn't it?

1:17:14.631 --> 1:17:17.175
It's not cock that I miss.

1:17:17.342 --> 1:17:19.594
It's my turn now to be
the person I left behind

1:17:19.761 --> 1:17:22.514
when I fell in love and
decided to live with you.

1:17:22.681 --> 1:17:24.266
And I won't do
without that anymore,

1:17:24.432 --> 1:17:26.685
even if it means leaving you.

1:17:26.852 --> 1:17:29.187
If that's what
you want, go ahead.

1:17:29.354 --> 1:17:31.273
Make up your mind!

1:17:31.439 --> 1:17:35.861
You know, when I see you
naked, I no longer desire you.

1:17:37.404 --> 1:17:39.685
If I don't turn you on anymore,
then that's your problem.

1:17:39.781 --> 1:17:41.992
Oh, you're just a whore.

1:17:42.159 --> 1:17:45.120
Now that I can barely
walk, you tell me this?!

1:17:45.287 --> 1:17:48.623
I can't stand you asking why
I did this, why I did that!

1:17:48.790 --> 1:17:52.377
I don't want your illness
anymore, your smell of medication.

1:17:52.544 --> 1:17:54.045
I want my life back.

1:17:57.549 --> 1:17:58.758
Get away from me!

1:18:11.563 --> 1:18:12.981
Dona Sebastiana!

1:18:19.321 --> 1:18:19.946
Get out of here!

1:18:20.113 --> 1:18:21.113
Open the door!

1:18:21.198 --> 1:18:23.783
Help me, Dona Sebastiana.

1:18:23.950 --> 1:18:26.453
I don't want to see you anymore!

1:22:03.670 --> 1:22:05.630
I don't want to go out.

1:22:05.797 --> 1:22:07.590
Go and fuck at your place!

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:08.800
You can't come back here!

1:22:08.967 --> 1:22:11.177
You are a real son of a bitch!

1:22:11.344 --> 1:22:12.554
Fuck off.

1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:16.057
You would actually
love to fuck us, right?

1:22:16.224 --> 1:22:19.185
Whatever, bitch.

1:22:19.352 --> 1:22:20.437
Are you okay?

1:22:30.613 --> 1:22:31.613
Hey, you.

1:22:32.949 --> 1:22:34.951
What are you looking at?

1:22:37.704 --> 1:22:39.831
Never saw a woman before?

1:23:41.643 --> 1:23:43.019
Fuck me.

1:23:43.186 --> 1:23:44.186
Fuck me.

1:24:04.457 --> 1:24:05.457
What?

1:24:07.377 --> 1:24:08.836
Do you prefer boys?

1:24:10.004 --> 1:24:11.004
No.

1:25:43.890 --> 1:25:48.353
My Hindu friend,

1:25:56.152 --> 1:25:57.945
tonight, I was driving

1:26:01.699 --> 1:26:03.159
and thought of you.

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:13.961
How are you?

1:26:22.970 --> 1:26:24.180
Are you alive?

1:26:29.102 --> 1:26:30.895
I feel like I'm dying,

1:26:37.485 --> 1:26:39.612
but no one says anything.

1:27:08.433 --> 1:27:09.851
Since the transplant,

1:27:10.017 --> 1:27:12.019
have you felt your life
has gone back to normal?

1:27:12.186 --> 1:27:14.814
Yes, no, or more or less?

1:27:14.981 --> 1:27:16.190
Yes.

1:27:16.357 --> 1:27:18.568
Have you had problems in
your personal relationships?

1:27:18.735 --> 1:27:19.735
No.

1:27:20.903 --> 1:27:22.548
Have you been
able to do the things you did

1:27:22.572 --> 1:27:23.906
before the transplant?

1:27:24.073 --> 1:27:25.283
Yes.

1:27:25.450 --> 1:27:28.035
Do you worry about what
the future will bring?

1:27:28.202 --> 1:27:28.828
Yes.

1:27:28.995 --> 1:27:29.995
Well, no.

1:27:30.747 --> 1:27:31.747
No.

1:27:33.458 --> 1:27:34.476
Do you have thoughts about

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:36.461
the possibility of death?

1:27:36.627 --> 1:27:37.627
No.

1:27:39.464 --> 1:27:41.716
Have you had
problems in your sex life?

1:27:41.883 --> 1:27:42.883
No.

1:27:44.135 --> 1:27:46.846
Are your erections strong
enough to achieve penetration?

1:27:47.013 --> 1:27:48.013
Yes.

1:28:18.127 --> 1:28:20.463
Dear Dr. Ricardo Steen,

1:28:20.630 --> 1:28:23.966
thank you for referring
your patient, Diego Fairman.

1:28:24.133 --> 1:28:26.719
During his treatment, he
underwent a bone marrow transplant

1:28:26.886 --> 1:28:30.097
for an aggressive
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1:28:30.264 --> 1:28:33.226
According to our records,
after five years,

1:28:33.392 --> 1:28:35.812
the patient is
considered in good health

1:28:35.978 --> 1:28:37.480
and free of disease.

1:28:39.315 --> 1:28:40.795
The patient now will
be under the care

1:28:40.942 --> 1:28:42.360
of the doctor of his choice.

1:28:42.527 --> 1:28:44.695
Our recommendations for
the longterm followup

1:28:44.862 --> 1:28:46.280
are attached in this letter.

1:28:46.447 --> 1:28:50.409
Don't hesitate to contact me
if you have any questions.

1:28:50.576 --> 1:28:52.829
Best regards, Mary Flowers.

1:29:22.149 --> 1:29:24.318
Camera rolling.

1:29:24.485 --> 1:29:26.195
Action.

1:29:53.848 --> 1:29:56.809
You're the film director.

1:29:56.976 --> 1:30:00.563
I think you were friends
with my grandfather.

1:30:00.730 --> 1:30:02.565
I don't think so.

1:30:02.732 --> 1:30:04.066
Maybe your father.

1:30:04.233 --> 1:30:05.233
My father?

1:30:05.276 --> 1:30:06.736
I don't think so.

1:30:08.237 --> 1:30:10.656
Got my permit to shoot my film.

1:30:10.823 --> 1:30:11.823
Good luck.

My parents in Warsaw.

That's my mother, my father.

1:32:21.037 --> 1:32:23.289
- Look.
- Happy birthday.

1:32:23.456 --> 1:32:25.041
- Oh, my god.
- Mama!

1:32:25.207 --> 1:32:25.958
Mama!

1:32:26.125 --> 1:32:26.834
Mama!

1:32:27.001 --> 1:32:27.752
Mama!

1:32:27.918 --> 1:32:28.627
Mama!

1:32:28.794 --> 1:32:29.545
Mama!

1:32:29.712 --> 1:32:30.838
Mama!

1:32:31.005 --> 1:32:32.173
Happy birthday, Mama.

1:32:32.339 --> 1:32:35.342
Woo!

1:32:42.183 --> 1:32:43.851
Remember that team?

1:32:46.729 --> 1:32:49.940
It's good to come
back home, isn't it?

1:32:53.944 --> 1:32:57.198
I know you blame me
for Father's death.

1:32:58.449 --> 1:33:00.910
I'm so ashamed of
everything I did.

1:33:02.286 --> 1:33:03.621
I was so naive.

1:33:05.706 --> 1:33:10.586
First, they let me win, and
then they took all the money,

1:33:10.753 --> 1:33:13.589
which wasn't mine,
it was Father's.

1:33:15.341 --> 1:33:16.759
It was all he had.

1:33:19.386 --> 1:33:22.306
I went crazy when
you were dying.

1:33:22.473 --> 1:33:23.974
I tore up the check.

1:33:25.142 --> 1:33:28.312
When I touched it,
it burned it my hand.

1:33:28.479 --> 1:33:31.190
You don't owe me an explanation.

1:33:32.441 --> 1:33:37.196
We've all done things
we'd rather not have done.

1:33:37.363 --> 1:33:40.157
I didn't stay for
Father's funeral.

1:33:40.324 --> 1:33:42.493
I grew up without
knowing where you were

1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:44.453
until Father's death.

1:33:50.292 --> 1:33:52.962
It's me who needs to apologize.

1:33:54.797 --> 1:33:59.009
I abandoned you when
you needed me the most.

1:33:59.176 --> 1:34:01.470
I left Father alone when he
was sick and out of work.

1:34:01.637 --> 1:34:03.639
I only thought of myself.

1:34:10.479 --> 1:34:11.479
Just think,

1:34:15.025 --> 1:34:18.988
all the blood running
through my body is yours.

1:34:20.322 --> 1:34:22.533
Then you're fucked, man.

1:34:26.787 --> 1:34:28.414
I hate you.

1:34:28.581 --> 1:34:31.542
I hate your father, and
you're just like him.

1:34:31.709 --> 1:34:34.295
Everything revolves around you.

1:34:36.422 --> 1:34:39.216
It's been like
that my whole life.

1:34:56.233 --> 1:35:00.654
I remember that day in Seattle
in your friend's house,

1:35:02.531 --> 1:35:05.868
when I brought you
tea, you were so rude.

1:35:08.579 --> 1:35:12.458
You shouted at me, "Go
away, Mother, go away.

1:35:13.959 --> 1:35:16.962
"Can't you see I'm
writing my film?"

1:35:21.508 --> 1:35:24.303
I knew then that you would live.

1:36:06.679 --> 1:36:11.684
Diego is
alone and staring at the walls.

1:36:15.813 --> 1:36:16.814
Empty walls.

1:36:20.526 --> 1:36:22.486
He has hit rock bottom.

1:36:47.928 --> 1:36:49.346
Interior, night.

1:36:50.597 --> 1:36:55.185
Ricardo tells Diego how he
escaped death from yellow fever.

1:36:56.145 --> 1:36:57.938
They toast to death.

1:36:58.105 --> 1:36:59.315
She interrupts.

1:37:00.566 --> 1:37:01.900
I'd like to make a toast.

1:37:02.067 --> 1:37:03.652
Yeah.

1:37:03.819 --> 1:37:06.613
To death, who
hasn't taken us yet.

1:37:06.780 --> 1:37:08.032
Excuse me.

1:37:08.198 --> 1:37:12.661
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I know who you are.

1:37:12.828 --> 1:37:15.414
I wanted to tell you
I've seen all your films.

1:37:15.581 --> 1:37:16.415
I know who you are.

1:37:16.582 --> 1:37:19.043
I saw you on that reality show.

1:37:20.044 --> 1:37:20.878
I can't believe it.

1:37:21.045 --> 1:37:22.463
Did you watch that shitty show?

1:37:22.629 --> 1:37:24.923
Not only did I watch
it, I voted for you.

1:37:25.090 --> 1:37:26.592
Thank you.

1:37:26.759 --> 1:37:31.430
I'm an actress, and I'd like
to invite you to see my play.

1:38:44.044 --> 1:38:45.129
I'm starving.

1:38:46.755 --> 1:38:48.340
Take me to dinner?

1:38:50.300 --> 1:38:53.554
When I was born, my
mother was very sick.

1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:57.224
They told me only one
of us would survive.

1:38:58.434 --> 1:39:02.062
We lived in a very small
city with no hospital.

1:39:02.229 --> 1:39:05.649
An ambulance would come
three times a week,

1:39:05.816 --> 1:39:09.611
and take her for treatment
in a city nearby.

1:39:10.779 --> 1:39:12.114
I remember coming
home from school

1:39:12.281 --> 1:39:14.533
and waiting till night fall

1:39:15.742 --> 1:39:18.954
for the ambulance
to bring her back.

1:39:19.121 --> 1:39:22.624
Never knew if she
would come or not.

1:39:22.791 --> 1:39:24.918
How old were you?

1:39:25.085 --> 1:39:27.713
Six, seven, I don't remember.

1:39:39.224 --> 1:39:41.477
She would say that
when she died,

1:39:41.643 --> 1:39:44.188
she would return as
a flycatcher bird.

1:39:48.275 --> 1:39:52.779
So, one day, the ambulance took
her and she never came back.

1:39:54.031 --> 1:39:56.742
I was by myself at
home for two days.

1:39:56.909 --> 1:39:59.453
No one came to tell me anything.

1:40:00.662 --> 1:40:02.664
I ate all the cookies
in the kitchen pantry,

1:40:02.831 --> 1:40:05.209
packed my bags and left.

1:40:05.375 --> 1:40:06.835
And your father?

1:40:07.002 --> 1:40:09.421
My dad died when I was little.

1:40:09.588 --> 1:40:11.632
They told me he ate
a lot of cucumbers

1:40:11.798 --> 1:40:13.258
before going to
sleep that night.

1:40:14.885 --> 1:40:16.929
When I got to Sao Paulo,
the very next day,

1:40:17.095 --> 1:40:21.225
I got a job as a Barbie
doll on a TV commercial.

1:40:21.391 --> 1:40:23.519
I wanted to be an actress.

1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:28.732
I heard you've been
very ill, is that true?

1:40:28.899 --> 1:40:30.776
Everyone asks that.

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:33.487
It's a long story.

1:42:11.168 --> 1:42:15.631
I was 17 when I left home
on a cargo ship for Europe.

1:42:16.923 --> 1:42:19.885
I wanted to be a film director.

1:42:20.052 --> 1:42:22.679
I worked a lot in
movies as an extra.

1:42:22.846 --> 1:42:24.931
Sometimes, I can see
myself on television

1:42:25.098 --> 1:42:27.768
at 4:00 a.m. on a
spaghetti western.

1:42:29.603 --> 1:42:32.105
I didn't want to come home.

1:42:32.272 --> 1:42:33.732
But, one day, my mother wrote me

1:42:33.899 --> 1:42:35.859
and said I couldn't come home.

1:42:36.026 --> 1:42:40.238
They'd arrest me because I
didn't do my military service.

1:42:40.405 --> 1:42:45.327
So, I came to Brazil because
it was the nearest country.

1:42:46.536 --> 1:42:47.996
I still wanted to
work in the movies.

1:42:48.163 --> 1:42:52.000
So, one day, I was visiting
a production office

1:42:54.252 --> 1:42:56.755
and I went in, and
no one was there.

1:42:56.922 --> 1:42:58.840
They were out making a movie.

1:42:59.007 --> 1:43:00.550
The phone rang, I picked it up.

1:43:00.717 --> 1:43:02.469
It was an advertising agency,

1:43:02.636 --> 1:43:04.012
they wanted to make a commercial

1:43:04.179 --> 1:43:07.641
showing the town lit
up for Christmas.

1:43:07.808 --> 1:43:09.476
That was my first
job as a director.

1:43:12.270 --> 1:43:16.441
Then I met my wife,
and everything changed.

1:43:16.608 --> 1:43:19.528
I started making movies
until an illness stopped me,

1:43:19.695 --> 1:43:22.197
and I spent years doing nothing.

1:43:24.032 --> 1:43:25.659
And when was that?

1:43:26.493 --> 1:43:28.078
It's not over yet.

1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:50.308
Good morning.

1:43:52.686 --> 1:43:54.771
You again?

1:43:54.938 --> 1:43:55.938
Yeah.

1:43:56.857 --> 1:43:59.943
I was passing by and
decided to visit you.

1:44:06.199 --> 1:44:07.993
I have some good news.

1:44:09.786 --> 1:44:13.915
Our company was bought by a
group of Israeli investors.

1:44:14.082 --> 1:44:17.335
They thought I was
too old, and fired me.

1:44:19.838 --> 1:44:21.757
Now, you're a free man.

1:44:24.050 --> 1:44:26.136
What about your wife?

1:44:27.763 --> 1:44:30.724
I took retirement,
and we separated.

1:44:30.891 --> 1:44:32.392
She was too jealous.

1:44:35.270 --> 1:44:38.231
Nowadays, I answer to no one.

1:44:38.398 --> 1:44:39.649
If the weekend comes along

1:44:39.816 --> 1:44:42.652
and I feel like
fishing, I just go.

1:44:47.282 --> 1:44:48.282
So,

1:44:51.870 --> 1:44:54.956
you gonna make that
film you promised?

1:44:55.123 --> 1:44:56.124
I already am.

1:44:57.042 --> 1:44:58.126
Am I in it?

1:44:59.002 --> 1:45:00.337
Yes, you are.

1:45:02.005 --> 1:45:03.965
Who's gonna play me?

1:45:04.132 --> 1:45:05.509
I don't know yet.

1:45:09.387 --> 1:45:12.557
Well, what happens
next in the story

1:45:15.227 --> 1:45:16.311
is up to you.

1:45:21.107 --> 1:45:22.107
I got to go.

1:46:51.781 --> 1:46:56.161
