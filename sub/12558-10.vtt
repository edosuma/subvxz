DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT SOME
THESE SCIENTIFICALLY ADVANCED MONKEYS

03:29.710 --> 03:32.873

SUCH A STEP.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.812

PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES,

15:08.825 --> 15:11.487

TO BE TORPEDOED.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.493

15:21.546 --> 15:24.254
YET YOU GOT
ABOARD. HOW?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.173
THAT DOESN'T MATTER,
I DID GET ABOARD.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.843
BUT I'M NOT SAILING

15:55.788 --> 15:58.496

CAPTAIN, SAY I AM A LUNATIC. SAY
EVERYTHING I'M TELLING YOU NOVV

16:16.476 --> 16:19.810

30:22.362 --> 30:24.478
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE

30:24.573 --> 30:26.985
VVITH VVHAT IT'S LIKE TO
BURY MEN IN THE SAME SOIL.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.989
I'LL NOT SIT HERE AND

VVELL, YOU'RE IN FOR SOME
GRATIFYING TIMES, MR. HANFORD.

30:46.345 --> 30:50.213

YOU CAN SIT ON THE SIDELINES

31:00.025 --> 31:02.062
BECAUSE, ACCORDING

31:02.152 --> 31:05.895
THIS COUNTRY'S GOING TO GET VIRILE AS
THE DEVIL. FROM SAN JUAN TO INCHON.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.573
<i>WE'LL SHOW HOW RED OUR BLOOD

ASPECTS OF THIS.</i>

31:12.704 --> 31:15.913
ONE IS THAT YOU WON'T
HAVE TO SPILL ANY.
