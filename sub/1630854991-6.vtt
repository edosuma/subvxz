00:13.600 --> 00:15.576
Would you like me
to hear your confession, Frank?

00:15.600 --> 00:17.176
I'm not sorry
for any of the things I did.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.200
His heart stopped
for three minutes, Bren.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.400
He was dead.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.936
He'll be dead
a lot longer than that

00:21.960 --> 00:24.040
if he goes telling tales
to some priest.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.840
My family would underwrite
your business.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.440
You already have the Kinsellas.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.040
You'll have our protection.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.896
The Batuks are just
bleeding us dry with this debt.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.320
I'll bet they've chosen who
they want to take over from us.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.216
If it was me,
I'd be going for Wayne Madigan.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.280
This is for you.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.599
You're part of this family.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.800
Stay away from Anna.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.736
Are you gonna kill me, Michael?

00:40.760 --> 00:42.496
- Tell me something about yourself.
- Like what?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.976
Something I don't
already know from Google.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.400
It's not all true.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.880
But some of it is.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.096
Well, when we were going through
Donovan's belongings,

00:49.120 --> 00:50.720
we found this.
The original has

00:50.920 --> 00:52.400
Amanda Kinsella's
fingerprints on it.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.560
I got a heads-up
from the DPP.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.656
They say they need more time
to prepare their case.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.080
Why would they be asking
to postpone at this late date?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.559
Kem's a rat.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.560
This about Eamon?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.679
Amanda knows about it.

01:02.680 --> 01:03.840
She's cool with it.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.440
Anthony and Viking
sorted Kem out.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.040
Hope they were careful,
don't we?

01:09.280 --> 01:11.080
Don't want them
gettin' locked up.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.880
Kem was with
the Kinsellas a long time.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.640
I think there must be
something you know

01:15.720 --> 01:16.920
that'll help us get them.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.560
Nikita Kaye, I'm arresting you

01:18.840 --> 01:21.280
for soliciting another person
or persons to commit murder.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.800
Nikki!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.400
I don't want you here.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.240
You're kicking me out
over what? Over Kem?

01:26.360 --> 01:29.040
I'm kicking you out

01:29.280 --> 01:31.200
because I can't trust you
anymore.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.440
Name.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.240
Your name, please.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.800
Nikita Kaye.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.840
Do you understand
why you're here, Nikita?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.320
I think so.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.280
You've been arrested
under Section 4

01:50.440 --> 01:53.040
of The Offenses Against
the Person Act 1861

01:53.280 --> 01:54.640
on suspicion of soliciting

01:54.880 --> 01:57.520
another person or persons
to commit murder.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.840
Now Garda Foley's gonna
conduct a full body search.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.400
We can wait for your solicitor
to be present at the station.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.760
No.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.416
I'd like you
to take off your clothes

02:09.440 --> 02:10.960
and place them on the table.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.880
H-How much do you want me
to take off?

02:13.120 --> 02:16.600
Everything.
All of your clothes.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.200
Place them on the table.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.120
Can I get
some help, please?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.520
Go ahead.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.600
What the fuck?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.880
Are you fuckin' deaf?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.600
Well?

03:11.840 --> 03:14.280
Donal's down there now.
He hasn't seen her yet.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.200
What did the cunt say exactly?

03:16.400 --> 03:19.920
Just that she was under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.120
- Doesn't make any fuckin' sense.
- I know.

03:22.360 --> 03:26.160
It has to be that job Kem done
for me -- the eyewitness thing.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.440
Nikki was the one
who paid him for it.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.040
Does she know that Anthony
was with you last night?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.400
No. Even if she did, she wouldn't
fucking say anything anyway.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.520
Seeing Nikita
get lifted like that

03:36.760 --> 03:38.720
right after Kem's been plugged,

03:38.920 --> 03:41.240
someone's fuckin' squealin'.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.560
What's the name of your one --
Kem's mot?

03:45.840 --> 03:48.120
Jess. Jess Duggan.
Jess Dugan.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.560
Go get her.
Bring her in here.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.720
Let's see what she got
to say for herself.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.240
What the fuck are you
waiting for? Go on!

04:00.560 --> 04:01.840
Yeah.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.920
Is something wrong?

04:18.080 --> 04:19.120
What happened?

04:19.400 --> 04:21.080
Just get in the car.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
Why did you do it?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.160
What?
Kem.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.000
I've no idea what
you're talking about --

04:28.080 --> 04:31.800
Don't lie to me, Anthony.
Bren told me.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.800
Was it you
who pulled the trigger?

04:35.360 --> 04:37.920
No. Viking did.
I waited by the car.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.200
Okay.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.080
You know, the Guards
have been to Viking's

04:45.200 --> 04:47.880
and arrested Nikita?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.320
Doesn't mean anything.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.120
It means they have her phone

04:51.320 --> 04:53.640
and can check all her texts
and messages with Viking.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.360
I hope you're not mentioned
in any of them.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.920
Just you being there

04:58.160 --> 04:59.880
means you could be
found guilty of murder.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.920
That is life
if you're convicted.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.360
Why would you take
that stupid kind of risk?

05:05.560 --> 05:08.080
I'm not gonna be convicted.
We were careful.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.120
Well, how come Nikki
has been lifted, then?

05:10.280 --> 05:11.600
I don't know.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.840
Where did you meet him?
Kem. Before?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.720
We collected him from his house.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.520
But we stayed in the car
and we kept our hoods up.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.040
Nobody saw us.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.320
What about your phone?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.880
I left it at home.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.400
And the clothes
you were wearing?

05:27.640 --> 05:30.240
Burned them with the car.
And my trainers, too.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.640
I told you, Mam.
We were careful.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.040
Fucking hell, Anthony.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.920
Shut up, Floyd!

06:07.920 --> 06:09.160
Aren't we supposed to wait?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.360
You want someone else
getting them first --

06:11.520 --> 06:12.640
taking our payday?

06:12.880 --> 06:14.920
Which one should we go after?

06:15.120 --> 06:17.000
Michael.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.360
Most money's for him.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.960
Yeah.
What about Viking?

06:20.120 --> 06:22.240
He could do with
a fuckin' bullet in the head.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.000
Any of them will do.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.040
But Michael's the one
they'll pay big for.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.720
He's a cagey fucker, though.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.240
So fuckin' what?

06:30.480 --> 06:31.800
You know where he lives.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.400
You know where
his young one lives.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.920
Just fuckin' find him.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.080
I need to speak to Michael.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.240
Alright, Anthony?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.200
Did you hear that
Nikita was arrested?

07:20.360 --> 07:22.160
No. Why?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.560
Has to be about
Viking shooting Kem.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.400
Bren had Viking take Anthony
along when he was doing it.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.120
You okay?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.880
Yeah. Just...

07:38.080 --> 07:40.040
So did you see Eddie Lucas?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.600
Yeah. So you were right
about Madigan.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.040
He's Batuks' main man.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.160
The orders have just
been paid to back him up.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.280
So they're definitely
planning on making a move?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.920
Yeah. The Batuks have offered
money and weapons.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
We're gonna have to
hit them first.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.920
Well, if they're still
waiting on money and guns,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.040
then we've a little time
to work things out.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.000
Did he say anything else?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.120
That all his dealings
are with the cousin, Hamza.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.120
There was no mention of Nuray.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.720
You think Hamza's
doing a solo run?

08:09.960 --> 08:12.120
I wouldn't be surprised.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.160
And apparently the Batuks had
Beady Donovan in their pocket

08:15.360 --> 08:19.040
the whole time he was
doing business with us.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.760
Beady fuckin' Donovan.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.720
That's what the Guards have.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.960
I need to go.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.880
Anthony!
I'm going out now.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.920
I want you to get
whatever clothes

08:37.160 --> 08:39.296
you were wearing last night
and put them on a hot wash.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.800
If the Guards call, do not
let them in without a warrant.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.720
And don't say a word
if they ask you anything.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.120
Just ring me straight away.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.280
- Where's Dad's stuff gone?
- Huh?

08:49.520 --> 08:51.040
All Dad's stuff
from the bathroom.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.760
It's gone. Where is it?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.160
Your dad and I want to talk
to you about that together.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.280
Is this about Uncle Michael?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.360
What?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.280
No.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.320
I'll just fuckin' ring Dad
and get the truth meself.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
Hey ya.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.400
I have a hypothetical
question for you.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.000
Okay.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.000
If I had given the details of
a bank account I was gonna use

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
to a business associate
that was then killed

10:17.440 --> 10:20.960
and the Guards got hold
of those bank details...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.400
what would they do?

10:22.640 --> 10:24.720
Do they know
the bank account is yours?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.400
Let's say they do.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.840
If they had reason to suspect
the account was being used

10:29.000 --> 10:30.640
for something like
money laundering

10:30.880 --> 10:33.760
or financing terrorism,
they could apply for an order

10:33.960 --> 10:36.960
under the Criminal Justice Act
to compel your bank

10:37.160 --> 10:40.120
to provide them with details
of your transactions.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.200
So they can basically monitor
the bank account

10:42.280 --> 10:43.320
without me knowing?

10:43.520 --> 10:44.840
Absolutely.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.040
Before we begin,
I'd like to read

10:53.240 --> 10:55.880
a prepared statement
on behalf of my client.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.440
Go on.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.720
My client has nothing to say
at this point in time.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.360
She will consider your questions

11:01.600 --> 11:04.720
and respond if she can
at a later date.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.440
Can you please confirm your name
as Nikita Kaye?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.200
No comment.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.560
Nikita...

11:19.800 --> 11:21.480
do you recognize this man?

11:27.640 --> 11:28.800
No comment.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.200
His name is Issac Kemela.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.560
Did you visit Mr. Kemela
in his home

11:33.840 --> 11:36.720
on the evening
of the 21st of October last?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.240
No comment.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.920
We have a witness
who says you did.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.080
Do you remember
the purpose of that visit?

11:45.240 --> 11:46.440
No comment.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.160
On that evening,
did you pay Mr. Kemela

11:49.320 --> 11:51.120
a sum of 12,000 euros

11:51.360 --> 11:54.400
for the purpose of hiring
someone to commit a murder?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.840
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

12:04.320 --> 12:08.240
Ms. Kaye, did you give
Mr. Kemela 12,000 euros

12:08.440 --> 12:11.600
for the purpose of hiring
someone to commit a murder?

12:15.040 --> 12:17.800
My client has nothing to say
at this point in time.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.960
She will consider your questions

12:20.200 --> 12:23.720
and respond if she can
at a later date.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.040
Fuck's sake. Look, man.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.080
Just watch the road.
Don't let them see you staring.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.800
Pull in there.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.096
Maybe they're taking her
to her Mam's or something.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.840
Well, let's see.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.800
If this is Michael...

13:36.520 --> 13:37.720
As soon as you see him,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.336
just shoot straight
through the glass.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.480
Don't even wait for him
to open the door.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.040
I know.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.360
What's your story?

14:17.560 --> 14:19.280
He's not in there.
Let's go.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.000
So...
what's the plan?

14:37.200 --> 14:39.240
I don't know.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.200
What would you normally do
a night like this?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.040
On a night like this,
I might go for something to eat.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.960
Cool.
Let's do that then.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.440
What did your mother say?

14:48.560 --> 14:50.640
She didn't give a reason.
That's why I'm calling.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.536
Your mom wants both of us to talk
to you together about this. That's all.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.080
Just tell me what happened.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.840
Was it Mam who decided all this?

14:57.040 --> 14:58.960
No, it was both of us together.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.360
I don't believe you.
Why are you lying?

15:01.560 --> 15:05.240
Listen, son.
Don't be worrying, please.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.120
Everything's gonna be fine,
I promise you.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.200
Jimmy!
Bren's looking for you.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.560
So I got to go now, buddy.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.640
But everything's
gonna be okay. Yeah?

15:17.880 --> 15:18.880
Yeah.
I love yo--

15:32.560 --> 15:34.080
Frank?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.400
Open the door!
Frank.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.400
Look at the state of you.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.240
This place is an absolute kip.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.840
I'm not in the mood
for a lecture.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.600
You're lucky
that's all you're getting.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.120
I had to talk Bren
out of coming 'round here.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.200
Let him fuckin' come.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.640
Really? Let him come?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.920
I should punch you
in the fuckin' face.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.800
I need you
to be helping me, Frank.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.136
Instead, you're moping around
here feeling sorry for yourself.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.640
What do you have to feel
so sad about, anyway?

16:19.840 --> 16:23.720
I am the one stuck in that
fuckin' house with him, not you.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.080
Geez. Have a shower, will ya?
You stink.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.400
They hook her
to Pearse Street station.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.600
She had her baby and suitcases

16:35.840 --> 16:37.240
and fuckin' everything with her.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.120
After what happened
last time,

16:39.280 --> 16:41.200
they're making sure this witness
is out of reach.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.560
Out of reach where?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.640
Safe house somewhere.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.800
How's Nikki doing?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.440
I won't lie.
Not good.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.520
Can you get me in to see her?

16:54.840 --> 16:56.720
Not a chance at the station.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.640
But if she doesn't get bail,
you can visit her in prison.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.880
It's what happens if
Nikki's convicted of this

17:03.040 --> 17:04.720
that really worries me.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.800
She's not cut out for prison.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.080
And she knows a lot --
about all of you.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.336
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.720
The Gardai look
at someone like Nikita,

17:15.920 --> 17:17.256
who they have
a strong case against.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.840
She's out of her depth,
falling apart.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.360
All they see is weakness
and opportunity.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.360
Nikki's not a fuckin' rat!

17:24.640 --> 17:26.936
Relax, Eric. He's only telling you
how the Guards will see it. That's all.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.136
Well, he should be focused on
trying to get her out instead!

17:29.160 --> 17:30.480
I know. I know.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.080
Eric, go out to the bar

17:33.280 --> 17:36.520
and get Donal a whiskey.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.080
What?
Go on!

17:39.280 --> 17:41.960
Calm the fuck down
while you're at it.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
Go on.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.120
John. Whiskey.
Cheap shit.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.080
If Nikita's convicted,
she's looking at a big number.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.960
Doing time is not
gonna be easy for her.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.120
She's only down the station,
she's already in bits.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.240
This could get messy, Bren.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.520
What did you do
with Kem's SIM card?

18:23.760 --> 18:25.200
Fucked it away.
Like you told me.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.840
Go get it back.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.600
Is that a joke?

18:29.840 --> 18:33.320
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.920
Go get it
and bring it back here.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.080
You two. With me.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.920
Frank?

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
Frank, are you alright?

19:06.080 --> 19:09.920
Yeah. I'll be down
in a second.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.560
Okay.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.560
Yeah.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.400
What?

19:50.600 --> 19:54.880
Suddenly now you don't want
to get out of your fuckin' face?

19:55.040 --> 19:58.000
So why are you here?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.800
I was just checking
You were okay.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.240
Well, I've had a shower
and the place is clean, so...

20:05.400 --> 20:08.040
you can go.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.480
Are you really gonna send me
back to that fuckin' house?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.600
Fuck's sake.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.760
It's just in this way.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.440
Take a seat.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.600
So, how soon can you get
a shipment of fenethylline

21:15.800 --> 21:18.920
into the country?

21:19.120 --> 21:20.720
Depends on the shipment.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.440
If I was interested
in importing...

21:26.680 --> 21:29.600
how exactly would it work?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.160
What do you need to know?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.840
Everything.

22:09.338 --> 22:10.618
You been to this place before?

22:10.818 --> 22:13.298
No. First time.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.898
Saw it on Instagram.

22:15.138 --> 22:16.898
Yeah, it's nice.

22:17.098 --> 22:18.738
So what did you do today?

22:18.938 --> 22:23.298
Just boring work stuff.
You know?

22:23.538 --> 22:25.738
Is this all you've ever wanted?

22:25.938 --> 22:27.578
What do you mean?

22:27.738 --> 22:29.058
What you do.

22:31.738 --> 22:35.258
What exactly
is it you think I do?

22:35.498 --> 22:38.498
Come on. I'm not a Guard.
I'm just... curious.

22:40.978 --> 22:43.938
Honestly, I don't --
I don't know.

22:44.138 --> 22:45.698
Okay.
Is it like the way

22:45.898 --> 22:47.938
doctors' children
become doctors?

22:48.178 --> 22:51.778
Yeah, probably.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.858
So do you ever regret it?

23:01.178 --> 23:02.898
I regret some things.
Yeah.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.858
Like what?

23:05.138 --> 23:07.058
I'm not gonna tell you that.

23:09.818 --> 23:12.658
You're a very closed person.
Do you know that?

23:20.858 --> 23:24.338
What does your mother
think of all this?

23:24.538 --> 23:25.818
My mother?

23:26.018 --> 23:28.178
Yeah.

23:28.338 --> 23:31.338
My mother's gone.

23:31.498 --> 23:32.898
Gone where?

23:33.138 --> 23:35.698
One night when we were kids,

23:35.898 --> 23:38.378
she took my sister and she left.

23:38.578 --> 23:40.458
And you never saw her again?

23:45.498 --> 23:46.538
Why would she do that?

23:46.738 --> 23:48.218
'Cause she had to.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.138
Thank you.

23:56.418 --> 23:57.538
Thanks.

24:11.578 --> 24:14.858
I heated up all the itsy bitsies
in the freezer.

24:16.178 --> 24:18.498
Yes.

24:22.898 --> 24:24.818
You into God now?

24:26.658 --> 24:27.698
No.

24:32.978 --> 24:36.378
Saw the parish newsletters
in the bin.

24:36.618 --> 24:39.618
The pills, I get, Frank.
I get that.

24:39.818 --> 24:41.058
Religion?

24:43.458 --> 24:45.538
You know you can tell God
about all the terrible shit

24:45.778 --> 24:47.098
that you've done...

24:47.298 --> 24:49.578
and be sorry
and he forgives you.

24:49.858 --> 24:52.458
That's a good fucking deal.

24:52.698 --> 24:56.018
You don't believe that shite.

24:59.938 --> 25:01.218
But what if it is true?

25:01.418 --> 25:04.778
It's not true, Frank.
You know it's not true.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.738
And telling people about
the terrible things you've done

25:09.938 --> 25:14.018
makes other people very nervous.

25:14.218 --> 25:15.578
Fuck Bren.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.978
You need to be careful.
You know what he's like.

25:23.218 --> 25:25.138
Well, I will look out for you.

25:39.218 --> 25:41.698
You want to know a secret?

25:41.818 --> 25:43.698
Sure.

25:43.938 --> 25:46.098
I don't give a fuck
about any of this.

25:48.858 --> 25:51.538
There's no place for me here
anymore. I know that. I don't care.

25:51.778 --> 25:53.738
Let Amanda and Bren
tear each other apart.

25:53.978 --> 25:56.618
I couldn't give a shit.
I want out.

25:56.818 --> 25:59.018
Out where?

25:59.218 --> 26:01.378
Doesn't matter.

26:01.578 --> 26:02.738
Just away from here.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.858
You know,
someplace sunny by a beach

26:05.098 --> 26:06.578
where I can just chill all day.

26:06.778 --> 26:10.378
Yeah.

26:10.618 --> 26:12.538
It's just the weed talkin'.

26:12.698 --> 26:14.938
No.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.658
I mean, why the fuck
do we even do this anymore?

26:18.858 --> 26:21.938
What's the point?

26:22.178 --> 26:25.858
You end up dead or in jail.

26:26.058 --> 26:27.098
Not me.

26:29.578 --> 26:31.138
'Cause I've got
enough money put away

26:31.338 --> 26:32.738
that I don't have to work

26:32.938 --> 26:35.738
or worry about
any of that shit ever again.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.618
What about me?

26:39.778 --> 26:41.618
Well, what do you mean?

26:41.818 --> 26:45.778
What am I going to do here
on me fuckin' own?

26:46.018 --> 26:47.298
I always look out
for you, Frank.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.298
You're supposed to
look out for me, too.

26:49.538 --> 26:51.018
Come with me, then.

26:54.018 --> 26:55.538
Really?

26:55.738 --> 26:57.978
Yeah. Sure. Why not?
It'd be fun.

26:58.218 --> 27:00.898
Yeah, it would.
It would be fun.

27:02.818 --> 27:04.218
Don't you remember
when we were kids

27:04.298 --> 27:08.258
and we used to go
to that caravan park?

27:08.418 --> 27:12.218
Yeah.

27:12.418 --> 27:15.978
Well, it would be like that,
only all the time.

27:16.178 --> 27:18.298
And somewhere nicer.
With money.

27:30.938 --> 27:32.458
He'd never let me go.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.738
He'd never let you
go either, Frank.

28:11.658 --> 28:13.338
Wanna go and check
to see if he's home yet?

28:13.458 --> 28:15.818
No. You don't go somewhere
and then go back again later.

28:16.058 --> 28:17.418
That's how you get
fucking spotted.

28:17.538 --> 28:19.178
- We can't just pack it all in now.
- Shh!

28:19.298 --> 28:20.898
I'm on a roll here.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.618
Listen. We have to
get someone -- anyone.

28:53.018 --> 28:54.778
Are you sure it's in here?

28:54.978 --> 28:57.098
Of course I'm fucking sure!

28:59.378 --> 29:01.338
Don't step in any messy shit.

29:01.538 --> 29:03.338
Don't want you
stinking up the car.

29:06.898 --> 29:10.178
Here!
I think I see it.

29:10.338 --> 29:12.058
It's down here.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.818
Is that it?

29:22.018 --> 29:23.418
Let's go.

29:33.098 --> 29:35.378
Seriously? You've never
been on Tinder?

29:35.538 --> 29:36.978
Nope.

29:37.178 --> 29:38.578
Wow.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.018
How do you meet people then?

29:42.218 --> 29:43.218
At the chemists'.

29:45.778 --> 29:48.738
Oh, you're gonna get me sacked.

29:48.938 --> 29:50.378
So you've been on Tinder, then?

29:50.538 --> 29:53.338
Yes. Of course.

29:53.538 --> 29:54.978
I'm a normal person.

29:55.218 --> 29:57.818
What, you just look at some
different photos of people

29:58.058 --> 30:01.098
and click on the ones
you like the look of?

30:03.258 --> 30:04.658
Pretty much.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.778
I think you'd do well on there.

30:07.978 --> 30:09.058
Alright.
Mm-hmm.

30:09.218 --> 30:10.338
Maybe I'll give it a try.

30:10.578 --> 30:12.258
Maybe you should.
Hm.

30:18.418 --> 30:19.818
I'm on early tomorrow,

30:20.018 --> 30:21.698
so I'm not staying
at your house.

30:21.898 --> 30:23.138
Okay.
I mean it.

30:23.298 --> 30:24.458
I know!

30:32.978 --> 30:34.098
Taxi home or...?

30:50.298 --> 30:51.298
Shame.

30:53.738 --> 30:55.458
What is?

30:55.658 --> 30:56.978
Everything.

32:40.898 --> 32:42.298
Hello?

32:44.058 --> 32:46.058
Who is this?

32:46.258 --> 32:48.858
This is the cunt
who's going to cut

32:49.018 --> 32:50.778
the fucking head
off your baby...

32:52.298 --> 32:54.458
if you don't shut
your fucking trap.

32:54.698 --> 32:57.098
'Cause we're
going to find you...

32:57.338 --> 33:00.498
and we're gonna kill you both,
your fucking little bitch.

33:07.898 --> 33:10.938
Get Lee and Dan
to find that bitch.

33:11.138 --> 33:12.578
Get rid of that.

33:52.386 --> 33:54.466
I take it you haven't heard
anything from the Guards?

33:54.626 --> 33:56.026
No.

33:58.266 --> 34:01.226
You and I need to talk about
what happened with Kem.

34:01.346 --> 34:03.346
I've nothing to say.

34:03.586 --> 34:06.426
I don't want you getting
involved with any of that stuff.

34:06.626 --> 34:09.106
It's dangerous. You're
gonna end up in prison.

34:09.306 --> 34:10.786
Doesn't seem to stop you.

34:12.626 --> 34:14.466
I want something better for you.

34:14.666 --> 34:18.266
I decide what I do, not you.

34:18.466 --> 34:19.986
And I'm not like Jamie, either.

34:20.186 --> 34:23.906
So don't think you can bully me
into doing what you want.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.266
So if that's it...

35:25.666 --> 35:28.906
- See you tomorrow, John.
- Night, Bren.

35:29.146 --> 35:30.586
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

35:30.826 --> 35:32.146
You wanna crash at Birdy's?

35:32.346 --> 35:35.266
Nah, Da. I'm gonna go
see me a lady friend.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.946
Good man.

35:51.906 --> 35:53.186
He's on the move.

35:56.146 --> 35:58.626
Alright. See ya...

36:04.706 --> 36:06.306
Birdy?

36:14.226 --> 36:15.786
Birdy!

38:30.706 --> 38:31.866
He's coming.

38:41.906 --> 38:42.986
Now.

38:54.266 --> 38:55.706
Fuck.

40:20.746 --> 40:23.026
Hey.

40:36.866 --> 40:38.706
Are you seeing someone?

40:42.186 --> 40:45.306
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose. Yeah.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.386
Do you know how risky that is?

40:47.626 --> 40:49.626
Bringing someone
into the family right now,

40:49.866 --> 40:52.626
with everything that's going on
with the Batuks?

40:52.786 --> 40:54.506
Is -- Is everything okay?

40:56.986 --> 41:00.066
There's a meeting this morning,
and I-I need you there.

41:00.266 --> 41:01.906
Okay. I'll just
grab me jacket then.

41:02.106 --> 41:03.106
Yeah.
Want to come in?

41:03.226 --> 41:04.506
No.

41:26.466 --> 41:29.906
Hey. How are you doing?
Come in. Come in.

41:33.306 --> 41:35.346
This is nice.

41:35.546 --> 41:37.946
You never been here before now?

41:38.146 --> 41:39.426
No.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.906
Well, make yourself at home.

41:42.106 --> 41:45.586
You are as much a part
of this family as anyone.

41:45.746 --> 41:48.306
I have some pastries
down here for you.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.746
And your present's down here,
as well. Come on.

41:57.866 --> 42:00.186
Just drop your stuff down there.

42:00.386 --> 42:02.026
Take a seat there.

42:06.386 --> 42:09.746
There you are now.
That's for you.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.786
Oh, my God. It's gorgeous.
Thank you.

42:18.986 --> 42:21.786
You like it, yeah?
Put it on.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.826
Hey. Come here.
Can I help you?

42:32.586 --> 42:34.466
We take this off, will we?

42:39.466 --> 42:41.066
Right.

42:43.906 --> 42:46.106
Can you lift your hair
up out of the way for me?

42:49.866 --> 42:52.786
That's it.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.826
There you go.

42:56.066 --> 42:58.466
Take a look in the mirror
and see what you think.

43:07.826 --> 43:08.986
I love it.

43:09.146 --> 43:11.026
Yeah? Come here.
Show it me on you.

43:13.346 --> 43:16.146
Oh, yeah.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.706
That looks really well on you.

43:21.786 --> 43:25.466
Are you peckish?
Here. Help yourself.

43:39.586 --> 43:41.346
I have to go.

43:49.746 --> 43:53.586
You know all that stuff we
were talking about last night?

43:53.786 --> 43:56.146
You won't say it to anyone else,
will you?

43:57.906 --> 43:59.826
Especially not to Bren.

44:03.786 --> 44:06.506
See you later.
See ya.

44:11.626 --> 44:14.106
It's that tasty? Huh?

44:16.506 --> 44:19.146
What's in the bag?

44:19.266 --> 44:21.346
It's my dance gear.

44:21.546 --> 44:23.306
I'm heading straight there
after this.

44:23.506 --> 44:24.586
Oh, you dance?

44:24.746 --> 44:26.026
Yeah.

44:26.186 --> 44:27.626
What, like Irish dancing?

44:27.906 --> 44:30.346
More like
hip-hop and freestyle.

44:30.546 --> 44:33.786
Oh, wow!
That sounds great!

44:34.026 --> 44:35.986
I'd love to see you dance.

44:36.226 --> 44:37.866
Well, we do parent performances.

44:38.026 --> 44:39.786
Maybe you could come
to one of those.

44:40.026 --> 44:42.026
Or maybe you can
show me here. What?

44:42.346 --> 44:43.546
I-I don't know.

44:43.786 --> 44:46.786
Ah. Go on.
I got you a present.

44:47.026 --> 44:49.746
And that could be like
your present to me.

44:49.906 --> 44:51.066
But there's no music.

44:51.266 --> 44:53.586
Birdy has a radio
here someplace.

44:53.826 --> 44:57.186
I'll go find it.
We'll get you some music.

44:57.426 --> 44:58.986
If you can't find it,
it's -- it's okay.

44:59.226 --> 45:00.322
I don't have to do it today.

45:00.346 --> 45:02.546
No, no, it's grand.
I'll find it.

45:08.066 --> 45:10.106
They're manufactured
in factories in Syria

45:10.346 --> 45:12.586
with the support of
the Syrian government.

45:12.826 --> 45:14.066
Fenethylline makes them more

45:14.226 --> 45:16.306
than all their legal exports
put together.

45:16.546 --> 45:20.266
My contact can arrange
transport to Ireland.

45:20.466 --> 45:22.146
How much?
Got them for 3,

45:22.346 --> 45:25.546
and then we can sell them from
anywhere between 10 and 15.

45:27.986 --> 45:31.106
If it's this good a deal,
why do you want me?

45:31.266 --> 45:32.626
Do it yourself. Clean up.

45:32.866 --> 45:34.786
Yeah, we would, but we have
a large debt to pay.

45:34.986 --> 45:37.066
Cash is tight.

45:37.266 --> 45:38.986
No one else
is selling these here.

45:39.186 --> 45:42.266
If we pooled all our resources
together, we could import enough

45:42.506 --> 45:46.866
to supply the entire country
and then split the profits.

45:47.106 --> 45:49.586
We all do good out of this.

45:51.626 --> 45:55.266
I want to meet your contact
before I make any decisions.

45:58.466 --> 46:00.626
Okay.

46:00.786 --> 46:02.586
We can arrange that.

46:13.226 --> 46:14.786
Don't be shy now, okay?

46:15.026 --> 46:18.426
Doesn't have to be perfect.
It's only me.

47:21.186 --> 47:23.666
I didn't know you were
coming over, love.

47:23.866 --> 47:26.306
Yeah, I just came
to collect my present

47:26.466 --> 47:29.946
that Grandad Bren bought for me.

47:30.146 --> 47:31.746
Do you like it?

47:31.946 --> 47:34.146
Yeah, it's --
it's beautiful, isn't it?

47:34.426 --> 47:36.305
Can I get you a drink
or something?

47:36.306 --> 47:37.826
Actually, I should be heading.

47:38.026 --> 47:39.746
I have to get
to dance rehearsals.

47:39.986 --> 47:42.162
Well, I'll give you a lift.
I don't want you to be late.

47:42.186 --> 47:43.866
Yeah, come here
and give your grandad

47:44.026 --> 47:46.706
another hug before you go.

47:46.946 --> 47:50.586
Ohh.
Great to see you, pet.

47:53.226 --> 47:54.362
Thanks again for the present.

47:54.386 --> 47:55.946
No bother.

48:07.146 --> 48:08.906
I'll see you again, love,
alright?

48:16.666 --> 48:19.466
Do you think Madigan
suspects anything?

48:19.706 --> 48:21.386
Nah.
He's just being cautious.

48:21.626 --> 48:25.066
How soon can Zehab meet him?

48:25.226 --> 48:26.866
As soon as we want.

48:32.226 --> 48:35.706
I was meant to say...
Jimmy's moved out.

48:39.546 --> 48:41.866
Why?

48:42.066 --> 48:44.786
Just wasn't really working,
I suppose.

48:51.506 --> 48:53.546
Mikey.

48:58.426 --> 49:01.346
You alright?

49:01.546 --> 49:02.946
It's Bren.

49:07.866 --> 49:10.266
He's doing it again.

49:10.426 --> 49:11.626
This time it's Anna.
