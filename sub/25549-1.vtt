WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.503
It's all arranged.

00:02.536 --> 00:05.239
I've transferred the money
into a new account.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.474
I'm ready to do this.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.110
We just need to wait
a little longer.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.112
He doesn't suspect anything,
does he?

00:11.145 --> 00:14.815
No, he's too busy
with work to notice.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.251
I can't wait for this
to finally be over.

00:17.285 --> 00:21.289
Me too, but I have to
get back to the lab.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.424
And you gotta get outta here.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.794
I'll call you later.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.739 --> 01:12.782
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.586
I- I've changed my mind, I don't
wanna be here anymore.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.887
I just wanna go home.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.589
You know I can't
do that, Stella.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.757
It's gonna okay.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.292
You just have to trust me...

01:31.659 --> 01:32.659
Trust me.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.432
What are you doin' to me?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.834
Don't fight it,
just try to relax...

01:41.535 --> 01:42.703
Relax.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.441
Owen, get up, we
have to get out of here!

01:49.377 --> 01:50.478
Call security!

01:50.511 --> 01:51.579
Don't let them leave!

03:04.685 --> 03:05.219
Help!

03:05.553 --> 03:06.420
Help!

03:06.454 --> 03:07.255
Leave me alone!

03:07.288 --> 03:07.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.989
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.957
Shh-shh.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.501
It's-it's-it's-it's
it's okay, calm down.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.293
Hey, hey, hey.

03:12.326 --> 03:12.860
Shhh.

03:12.893 --> 03:13.627
Stop, please calm-calm-

03:13.661 --> 03:14.428
Where am I?!

03:14.462 --> 03:15.396
Help!!

03:15.429 --> 03:17.398
I have no idea what you're
talking about-stop-

03:17.431 --> 03:18.911
please, please, please
stop screaming.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.609
I'm not gonna
say anything, okay?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.642
Just...

03:29.810 --> 03:30.911
Just let me go.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.513
You think I did this?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.816
Well, I don't remember
how I got here.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.718
You obviously drugged me!

03:37.751 --> 03:38.986
Why are you doing this?!

03:39.019 --> 03:41.822
Look, all I know is
I just woke up in bed

03:41.855 --> 03:44.258
next to a hysterical woman
that I don't recognize

03:44.292 --> 03:46.427
with the worst headache
of my life.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.629
You expect me to believe that?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.934
How do I know you didn't
slip me something last night?

03:55.769 --> 03:56.937
That's...

03:56.970 --> 03:58.238
That's ridiculous.

03:58.739 --> 03:59.739
Why?

04:01.609 --> 04:05.446
Look, I-I-I don't know what
you're trying to pull here,

04:05.479 --> 04:08.649
but I want you to get these
handcuffs off me right now.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.682
Um...

04:10.418 --> 04:11.818
What makes you think
these are mine?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.790
Do you see a key anywhere?

04:25.899 --> 04:26.899
No.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.971
Okay, okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.777
No.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.151
Nothing on my side either.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.982
Okay, umm, well...

04:43.517 --> 04:44.517
Right.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.714
These look like
professional locks.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.822
Umm...

04:50.491 --> 04:51.892
How about a bobby pin
or something?

04:51.925 --> 04:52.925
Maybe I can...

04:53.093 --> 04:54.093
Pick the lock?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.830
You sure know a lot
about handcuffs and locks.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.998
Not really.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.667
I usually just
kick the door down.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.871
Hey, hey look,
you got it wrong, okay?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.005
I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.973
I'm a fireman.

05:08.976 --> 05:09.976
I'm usually a...

05:10.811 --> 05:12.480
Dinner and a movie kind of guy.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.016
Well, I know for a fact
that we did not have dinner.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.050
You remember that?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.353
No, you're just not my type.

05:19.387 --> 05:23.391
Now, if you wouldn't mind just
focusing on getting these off

05:23.424 --> 05:24.492
so I can leave?

05:24.525 --> 05:25.693
Okay, okay.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.726
Umm...

05:28.028 --> 05:29.028
Where are we anyway?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.637
Well, it looks like
you went all out.

05:37.438 --> 05:41.609
A three star hotel called the
Pinewood Park on Aspen Road.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.643
Aspen Road?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.878
Alderville, New York.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.746
Alderville...

05:48.649 --> 05:49.917
Right, right.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.420
Okay, last thing I remember

05:52.453 --> 05:54.688
was leaving my sister
Bethany's house.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.922
And that was what?

05:56.490 --> 05:57.490
Yesterday?

05:57.858 --> 05:58.959
What day is it today?

06:00.561 --> 06:01.561
I've no idea...

06:02.896 --> 06:05.399
Look, that's my
phone over there,

06:05.433 --> 06:06.667
will you let me check?

06:06.967 --> 06:07.967
Yeah, sure.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.170
Okay, well...

06:10.203 --> 06:10.738
Right.

06:10.771 --> 06:11.405
Yeah.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.440
Umm...

06:12.773 --> 06:14.608
Okay, yeah, up on three?

06:14.642 --> 06:14.942
Mhm.

06:14.975 --> 06:15.308
One...

06:15.342 --> 06:16.810
Two, three.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.062
It says it's Thursday.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.033
I remember having breakfast
with my friend Allie

06:40.067 --> 06:43.471
and then everything after
that is just a blank.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.576
Stella.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.929
Stella, you're not
going anywhere!

06:50.377 --> 06:51.144
Let go of me!

06:51.178 --> 06:53.581
You can't keep me here, Larissa!

06:56.116 --> 06:57.116
Okay, what just happened?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.719
I-I-

06:58.752 --> 07:00.754
I just remembered
that there was a woman...

07:00.788 --> 07:02.422
Larissa.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.926
She was grabbing me and-
and keeping me from leaving.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.959
Leaving where?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.161
I'm not sure.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.968
Do you mind if we...?

07:16.003 --> 07:17.004
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.037
Sure.

07:18.138 --> 07:18.772
Umm...

07:18.806 --> 07:19.806
'kay.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.593
And I...

07:40.561 --> 07:41.805
I'm guessing this
belongs to you...

07:41.829 --> 07:42.963
Yes.

07:42.996 --> 07:43.996
Thank you.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.203
Need some help?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.004
No.

07:51.038 --> 07:51.939
I've got it, thanks.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.972
Okay.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.279
I can help you.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.849
Fine.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.116
Okay.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.153
Just get this...

08:08.288 --> 08:09.288
This...

08:10.558 --> 08:11.592
Sorry.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.836
I've been searching for them

08:12.860 --> 08:14.771
since they escaped last
night, they just disappeared.

08:14.795 --> 08:15.829
What about their cells?

08:15.863 --> 08:17.230
It goes directly to voice mail.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.099
They're not gonna
answer my calls.

08:20.067 --> 08:20.934
This is bad.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.135
We need to find them.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.169
Whatever it takes.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.608
Well, still don't see
our shirts anywhere.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.644
Where could we have left them?

08:33.246 --> 08:35.683
Um, why don't we start over.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.116
What's your name?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.086
Well, not that we'll be
together long enough

08:39.119 --> 08:41.688
to be on a first name basis,
but it's Stella.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.623
Owen.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.724
Owen Michaels.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.147
Did you just remember something?

09:07.848 --> 09:08.849
It was-it was nothing.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.617
Are you sure?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.084
'Cause it kinda
looked like you...

09:11.118 --> 09:12.285
No.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.823
Um, why don't we, check
the hallway for our shirts?

09:15.856 --> 09:16.856
'Kay.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.798
Alright.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.274
Wait, who are you calling?

09:34.307 --> 09:35.743
I'm calling my friend Allie

09:35.776 --> 09:37.711
to see if maybe she can help us.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.083
I called Stella's work,
she wasn't there.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.218
Reception's told me
she was fired a month ago.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.987
I don't know where else to look!

09:47.020 --> 09:48.789
What do you want me to do?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.023
I don't know.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.759
Maybe talk to
some of her friends,

09:51.792 --> 09:52.960
see if they know anything.

09:52.993 --> 09:53.993
Yes, ma'am.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.732
Hey, Allie, it's Stella.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.334
Can you call me back
as soon as you get this?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.269
Thanks.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.738
I can't remember
if she's working or not.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.406
She's a flight attendant
for Trans Air.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.976
Didn't you say that-that
you were visiting your sister?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.077
Could she help us?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.912
Yeah, but she's
gonna be at work.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.346
And Bethany's a little uptight.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.248
I'd rather explain
this one to her.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.016
Mhm.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.617
Great, my battery's almost dead.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.688
Wait a second, what is this?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.290
Okay, come on.

10:24.357 --> 10:24.858
Here.

10:24.892 --> 10:25.458
You okay?

10:25.492 --> 10:26.026
You okay?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.327
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.095
Here.

10:28.128 --> 10:28.962
Get over here.

10:28.996 --> 10:29.262
Okay.

10:29.897 --> 10:30.897
Okay.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.833
Whoever-whoever finds this...

10:32.866 --> 10:36.036
My name is Owen Michaels,
this is Stella Williams.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.006
There's woman named Larissa
who is trying to kill us.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.275
If we go missing, please take
that to the authorities.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.777
Tell my mom I love her.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.413
Who is Larissa?

10:46.446 --> 10:48.949
That's-that's the woman
that I remember.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.218
Where's my phone?

10:52.953 --> 10:53.953
Here.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.166
Maybe there's something on here
that'll explain what's going on.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.190
My phone's dead.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.928
We should call the police.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.962
What?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.272
Do you hear the sirens
in that video?

11:03.296 --> 11:03.797
Yeah...

11:03.831 --> 11:04.765
So?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.042
What if for some reason
they're after us?

11:06.066 --> 11:06.867
But...

11:06.900 --> 11:07.968
Why?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.970
I dunno, let's just
take a minute

11:10.003 --> 11:11.104
before we call the police.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.282
Well, what should we do now?

11:13.306 --> 11:16.043
Well, first thing: we need
to get these things off.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.310
Then gotta retrace our steps.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.212
Figure out what happened
last night.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.314
Hang on, I have a missed call.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.082
From who?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.884
I-I-I don't
recognize the number,

11:23.917 --> 11:26.319
but it came in a half hour
before that video

11:26.353 --> 11:28.188
and they didn't leave a message.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.125
Wait.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.160
Use the hotel phone.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.963
That way whoever it is
won't know it's you.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.109
Larissa White.

11:50.043 --> 11:50.510
What?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.543
That was Larissa.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.380
We gotta find this key.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.147
Yes.

11:54.181 --> 11:54.848
Umm...

11:55.182 --> 11:55.916
Okay...

11:56.183 --> 11:57.417
Did you check in here?

11:57.450 --> 12:00.120
Yeah, I looked in there, have
you checked all your pockets?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.153
Yes.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.264
Pinewood Park Hotel,
how may I help you?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.767
Hi, do you have a Stella
Williams staying with you?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.202
Sorry...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.545
Nobody here registered
with that name.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.906
What about an Owen Michaels?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.407
Yes, shall I connect you?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.843
Would you mind telling me
what room he's staying in?

12:24.544 --> 12:25.544
Nothing.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.417
Sorry, sorry.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.485
Umm...

12:32.519 --> 12:33.787
What about the couch?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.522
Do you think we were
on the couch?

12:35.555 --> 12:36.423
I don't know...

12:36.456 --> 12:37.925
You know what I mean, I...

12:59.312 --> 13:00.312
Okay.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.581
You know what?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.983
Who you calling now?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.152
Maintenance, we have to
get these cuffs off.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.225
Hi, could you send somebody
up who can pick a lock?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.228
Perfect and how long
will that be?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.163
Great, thank you.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.867
Sending somebody up right away.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.165
That was fast.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.244
That's Larissa!

14:04.277 --> 14:05.312
Owen, open up.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.546
I know you're in there.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.081
I just wanna talk to you.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.519
Excuse me!

14:14.587 --> 14:16.924
I seem to have locked myself
out of my room could you...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.501
Actually, I probably shouldn't.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.337
You're gonna have to ask
the reception.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.571
I'll do that.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.247
We have to get outta here.

14:40.280 --> 14:40.580
Yeah.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.491
Your phone... it's over there.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.192
Right.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.567
Okay.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.599
I think that's my jacket.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.101
What did she say?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.169
She just completely left me
waiting for it

15:36.203 --> 15:38.505
and I had to stay there
until 5, it's ridic-

15:52.719 --> 15:53.719
What's in here?

15:58.391 --> 15:59.659
What could we do with these?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.729
I got a few ideas...

16:26.986 --> 16:27.986
Is that blood?

16:28.655 --> 16:29.655
Is that blood?

16:31.391 --> 16:31.758
Blood...

16:31.791 --> 16:32.359
Sirens...

16:32.392 --> 16:33.392
Handcuffs?

16:34.227 --> 16:36.129
Actually I-I think
the cuffs were mine.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.330
What?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.375
The guys at the station must
have slipped them into my pocket

16:39.399 --> 16:40.399
as a joke.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.734
Thanks.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.549
I'm just worried that he's
done something to hurt himself,

16:46.573 --> 16:48.175
so-I just...

16:48.808 --> 16:49.442
Appreciate it.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.178
We gotta get out of here.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.146
Can we take a cab to your place?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.714
My keys are in my purse.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.715
Okay.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.085
Go to my sister's,
it's a bit of a ways out.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.420
I'm hoping there's something
in the garage we can use

17:00.453 --> 17:01.821
to get these cuffs off.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.790
I really appreciate it,
I'm just so worried,

17:03.823 --> 17:06.492
he's been acting
really strange lately.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
I just hope we're not too late.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.448
He's not in there...

17:30.283 --> 17:32.119
I guess he must be
okay after all.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.152
Thank you.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.396
Come on.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.698
Over here.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.138
Owen, Stella, wait!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.076
Owen, Stella, wait!

17:59.879 --> 18:00.879
Sorry.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.484
I'm waiting for the Amirs.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.718
Yep that-that's us!

18:08.755 --> 18:09.622
Go.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.361
Dammit!

18:19.932 --> 18:20.967
Hello?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.378
Larissa,
it's Dr.Jamison.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.603
I'm here with
Dr. Cooper.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.271
Is everything okay?

18:25.705 --> 18:26.749
Well, that's what
we wanna know...

18:26.773 --> 18:27.574
Where are you?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.441
I'm...

18:28.475 --> 18:30.410
I had a personal errand
I had to run.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.878
I'm on my way back now.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.846
Please come see us
when you get in.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.454
I hope everything
went okay last night.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.756
We can't afford any surprises
at this stage.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.892
You mean you can't
afford any surprises.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.795
You're as much
a part of this as I am, Mitch.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.763
I hope you don't ever
forget that.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.200
Look, I'm sure everything's
going to be fine, Ben.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.268
You always manage to
get what you want,

18:55.302 --> 18:57.370
I can't see how this
would be any different.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.870
Wow, this is really something.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.288
So this is your-
your sister's place?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.590
We both grew up here.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.526
And Beth decided to keep the
house after my parents died.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.663
There should be something
here I can use to get these off.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.398
So it's just the two of you?

19:59.866 --> 20:00.933
Now yes.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.203
This should work!

20:05.572 --> 20:06.932
You really think
that's gonna work?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.707
Trust me.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.622
So you like to be in control?

20:22.655 --> 20:23.655
Sometimes.

20:25.992 --> 20:26.992
No, no...

20:30.363 --> 20:31.798
Now you're stuck with me.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.700
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.353
There you go.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.522
You're free of me,
you got your wish.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.856
Told you you could trust me.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.426
Well, I'm just not
very good at trusting.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
Why's that?

21:04.864 --> 21:05.864
You okay?

21:06.333 --> 21:07.333
Let me see.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.403
I can put something on that
if you want.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.872
Then I can make you
something to eat.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.707
I don't know about you,
but I'm starvin'.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.442
Come on.

21:26.819 --> 21:27.996
You wanted to
see me, Dr. Jamison?

21:28.020 --> 21:31.023
I was wondering why you didn't
finish your report last night.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.359
It got late...

21:32.392 --> 21:33.960
I thought I'd finish up
this morning,

21:33.993 --> 21:35.003
but everything went well...

21:35.027 --> 21:37.096
I can't afford
any mistakes, Larissa.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.431
There's already been too many.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.465
I understand.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.644
I can assure you that
everything's under control.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.668
Good.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.471
That's all I wanted to hear.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.582
Here you go.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.050
Wow.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.920
A fireman and a chef.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.857
Not just a pretty face.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.993
We take turns cooking
back at the station.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.896
How long have you
been a fireman?

22:10.630 --> 22:11.630
Eleven years.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.434
I started off doing it here
for a year,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.636
and then I transferred
to Boulder after...

22:17.637 --> 22:18.637
After?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.775
Let's just say I needed
a change of scenery.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.010
So what about you?

22:26.145 --> 22:27.145
What's your story?

22:28.881 --> 22:32.485
Umm, well, I was
born and raised here.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.421
Most of my friends
left after college,

22:34.454 --> 22:36.423
but I stayed on to help my mom.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.390
And umm...

22:37.424 --> 22:39.158
It was just us for a long time,

22:39.191 --> 22:42.128
then she moved to Florida to
be closer to my grandmother.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.129
And your father?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.799
He left when I was little.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.871
So, what do you do for work?

22:52.739 --> 22:54.907
Up until a month ago,
I was a claims adjuster

22:54.941 --> 22:56.375
for an insurance company.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.610
Was?

22:57.644 --> 22:58.210
Mhm.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.145
What, did you get bored?

22:59.178 --> 23:00.146
No, no.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.983
I got fired for telling
my boss where to go

23:04.016 --> 23:06.753
when he denied a claim
for a five-year-old boy

23:06.786 --> 23:07.786
who had cancer.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.157
He said it was a
"pre-existing condition".

23:12.191 --> 23:13.191
Wow.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.630
That's Lilly...

23:19.899 --> 23:20.933
That's my younger sister.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.736
That's the, last good
picture we have of her

23:23.770 --> 23:24.770
before she got sick.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.509
She was, diagnosed with leukemia

23:29.542 --> 23:31.978
the summer of her sophomore
year and...

23:33.880 --> 23:35.482
Five months later she was gone.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.149
I'm so sorry.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.787
Looks like we have got
something in common after all.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.456
Owen?

23:43.490 --> 23:44.524
Is that you?

23:45.792 --> 23:46.792
Hey, Beth.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.028
There you are!

23:49.061 --> 23:51.698
I was worried about you when
you didn't come home last night.

23:51.731 --> 23:52.865
Where have you been?

23:52.899 --> 23:54.701
And why isn't
your car out front?

23:54.734 --> 23:56.669
Hi, I'm Bethany, Owen's sister.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.637
Hi, Stella.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.670
Hi.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.740
This is my big sister, Bethany.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.609
Let me get this for ya.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.543
Thank you.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.576
No problem.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.579
I'll see if my phone
is charged yet.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.249
Well, nice to meet you, Stella.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.282
You too.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.508
Yeah, I just reviewed
the security footage.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.943
They broke into
Dr. Cooper's office

24:36.976 --> 24:38.511
and stole some of his files.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.547
I need to get those back.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.262
So, how long
have you known Owen?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.229
Not long.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.098
Where'd you guys meet?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.000
It's kind of a long story.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.168
You know what?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.936
I'm just happy
he's dating again.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.204
Because between you and me...

25:06.205 --> 25:07.974
I was getting a little worried.

25:09.075 --> 25:13.112
Owen doesn't really, let
anyone get too close to him

25:13.145 --> 25:15.114
since our little sister,
Lilly, died.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.251
He was always the protective big
brother and when Lilly got sick,

25:19.285 --> 25:21.988
he did everything
he could to help.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.558
He thinks he failed her, so he
just kinda threw himself

25:25.592 --> 25:26.759
into his work.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.829
How long ago was that?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.800
Well, that would have been
five years ago on Saturday.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.101
Yeah.

25:35.134 --> 25:35.968
Wow.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.037
He comes back every year
at this time

25:38.070 --> 25:40.072
so we can go to
the cemetery together.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.977
So are you from around here?

25:45.011 --> 25:46.579
Yeah, yeah, I'm from Alderville.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.681
You're local!

25:48.715 --> 25:50.850
Wow, that's great, I've been
trying to get Owen

25:50.883 --> 25:52.919
to move back to town
for years, so...

25:52.952 --> 25:54.072
Maybe you'll have more luck.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.223
Listen, I know my brother
can seem

25:57.256 --> 25:59.726
a little rough
around the edges...

26:01.728 --> 26:03.830
He's a really good man.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.200
Anyway, it's really
nice to meet you,

26:08.234 --> 26:11.037
make yourself at home, I'm
just gonna run a few errands.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.171
Okay, thanks.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.204
No problem.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.809
Hey, gonna wanna see this.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.946
I must have put her contact
info in my phone last night.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.114
Didn't you say you had
a friend named Allie

26:22.148 --> 26:23.315
who worked for Trans Air?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.117
Yeah, but how would you
know her?

26:25.151 --> 26:26.151
I don't.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.214
I called her around
midnight last night.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.057
And there's more...

26:35.127 --> 26:36.195
Is he still there?

26:36.228 --> 26:37.363
Go, go, go!

26:40.232 --> 26:42.268
Wh-what is that,
a bowling alley?

26:42.735 --> 26:44.036
Looks like it.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.105
What were we doing there?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.138
I have no idea.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.118
What's going on, Larissa?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.019
What do you mean?

27:00.052 --> 27:02.088
Larissa, we've known
each other for years,

27:02.121 --> 27:03.956
I can tell when
there's something wrong.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.225
Now come on, we've always been
honest with each other

27:06.258 --> 27:08.127
and If you need to talk, or...

27:08.160 --> 27:09.361
If you need some help...

27:09.395 --> 27:11.698
I just want you
to know that I'm here.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.235
I don't understand.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.171
Why would we go to a bowling
alley if someone was chasing us?

27:19.205 --> 27:21.640
I don't know, maybe we were
trying to lose her?

27:24.777 --> 27:25.778
Well, let's go.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.412
Where?

27:52.839 --> 27:55.079
I really hope someone in
there's gonna have some answers.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.107
Yeah.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.285
Hey, hey...

28:06.318 --> 28:07.353
Look...

28:07.386 --> 28:09.188
I don't want any more
trouble here.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.022
I'm sorry?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.124
You have a lot of nerve
coming in here

28:12.158 --> 28:13.960
after what you did last night.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.295
We're just hoping you'll help
us tell us what happened.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.130
Get out, or I'll call the cops!

28:18.164 --> 28:18.931
I don't understand.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.867
Did we do something
to upset you?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.401
Are you kidding me?

28:22.434 --> 28:23.936
Where's security?!

28:30.476 --> 28:32.111
Dr. Cooper...

28:33.412 --> 28:36.849
I'm so sorry, I don't
understand what happened.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.127
One minute everything's going
the way that it usually does

28:39.151 --> 28:40.152
and then the next,

28:40.186 --> 28:42.321
the patients are acting
delusional and paranoid.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.390
I called security, but they
were so agitated

28:44.423 --> 28:45.925
I couldn't stop them
from leaving.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.159
Leaving?

28:47.193 --> 28:49.071
I spent all last night and
this morning looking for them...

28:49.095 --> 28:50.162
But we couldn't find them.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.212
This could jeopardize
everything.

28:55.902 --> 28:56.902
Yes, it could.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.569
Dr. Cooper.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.006
There's something else...

29:02.241 --> 29:03.943
The security footage,
I reviewed it.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.978
It looks like they
broke into your office

29:06.012 --> 29:07.279
and stole some of your files.

29:07.313 --> 29:07.947
My files?

29:07.980 --> 29:08.514
Which files?

29:08.547 --> 29:09.547
I don't know.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.250
I couldn't tell
from the footage.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.384
Larissa.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.412
It-it's Joey, right?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.558
Listen, the truth is we're
both having a little trouble

29:43.582 --> 29:45.885
remembering anything
about last night.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.054
So can you just
tell us what happened?

29:48.087 --> 29:50.389
You mean besides
clearing out my business?

29:50.890 --> 29:51.890
And this?

29:53.359 --> 29:54.359
I did that?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.062
This was the other guy.

29:56.863 --> 29:57.864
What other guy?

29:57.897 --> 30:00.166
The one with the other
girl you came in with...

30:00.199 --> 30:02.401
Do you-do you happen
to remember her name?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.503
I didn't have time
to introduce myself.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.174
The whole place went to hell
when you started screaming.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.143
I shoulda trusted my instinct.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.213
The way your were all acting,
I shoulda kicked you out

30:14.246 --> 30:15.514
when you first came in here!

30:21.587 --> 30:22.955
Nice driving there, brother!

30:29.628 --> 30:31.030
We're not even bowling yet.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.232
Hold on, wait a minute.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.240
You know what you cost me
in lost business?!

30:42.008 --> 30:44.977
Never mind scuffing up my lanes
with your street shoes!

30:46.979 --> 30:48.514
Hey, hey!

30:48.547 --> 30:51.217
You need to wear bowling shoes
if you're gonna play here.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.455
He's so mad!

30:56.488 --> 30:58.958
So mad!

31:03.162 --> 31:04.162
He's got a gun!

31:10.302 --> 31:11.302
Look.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.704
Come on over here.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.246
Yeah, this is, everything I got.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.013
For the damages.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.924
Okay, so we know we were
with an other couple.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.391
An other couple?

31:34.560 --> 31:35.594
You know what I mean.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.670
It's locked!

31:46.305 --> 31:47.173
Come on, Allie!

31:47.206 --> 31:48.206
Come on!

31:49.141 --> 31:50.141
What?

31:51.210 --> 31:52.210
Come on.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.546
We were with Allie...

31:56.615 --> 31:57.483
Your friend Allie?

31:57.516 --> 31:58.584
Yeah.

31:58.617 --> 31:59.285
Yeah!

31:59.318 --> 32:01.320
And-and we were in that car.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.357
And we were being chased
by somebody with a gun.

32:06.692 --> 32:09.095
Do you think that's why
she didn't call me back?

32:10.162 --> 32:10.997
Come on.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.302
It's locked.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.336
That's my purse...

32:18.870 --> 32:20.139
And that's my overnight bag.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.008
Mine's in there too...

32:22.041 --> 32:23.685
Well, why would we
have our overnight bags?

32:28.547 --> 32:29.581
What are you doing?

32:29.615 --> 32:30.615
Gonna look inside.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.421
See if there's something I can
find might give us some answers.

32:37.556 --> 32:38.556
Well...

32:40.526 --> 32:41.727
Here's one mystery solved.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.430
Yeah, but why didn't he
come back for his car?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.137
Maybe he doesn't
remember anything either.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.282
What are those?

33:05.284 --> 33:07.319
I dunno, any idea?

33:07.353 --> 33:09.088
Looks like old medical forms.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.121
Here.

33:14.060 --> 33:18.297
Okay, this says the car's
registered to Tony R. Carter,

33:18.330 --> 33:19.698
387 Palawan Lane.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.467
Do you think he
still lives there?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.169
Only one way to find out.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.558
Allie's my best friend.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.461
I don't know what I would do
if anything happened to her.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.796
Look, I'm sure she's fine.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.833
We made it to the hotel, they
probably just jumped in a taxi

33:54.866 --> 33:57.436
after they realized Tony
left his keys in the car.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.481
Yeah, you're probably right,
she probably just

33:59.505 --> 34:01.573
didn't get my messages
'cause her phone was off.

34:01.607 --> 34:02.607
Yeah.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.480
Have you found them yet?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.083
This needs to be handled now!

34:27.833 --> 34:30.369
Hey, stranger...

34:30.668 --> 34:31.668
Allie.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.145
Ooh, I must have had
too much wine.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.447
My head is throbbing.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.118
Do you have any coffee?

34:48.853 --> 34:51.123
I don't really remember
much from last night.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.161
Here, let me remind you.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.801
That feels amazing...

35:03.469 --> 35:03.835
Tony.

35:03.869 --> 35:04.869
Tony.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.540
Well, has anyone ever told you

35:08.574 --> 35:10.476
that you have magic hands, Tony?

35:13.312 --> 35:14.780
Maybe once or twice.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.309
Stay here, I'll be right back.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.342
Mhm.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
Hello.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.769
Knock, knock.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.840
Emily, what are you doing here?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.576
I heard it's finally done!

36:17.609 --> 36:18.609
You-

36:22.414 --> 36:24.316
God, I need you...

36:25.016 --> 36:26.318
It's been too long.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.319
No, no, no.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.620
Not here, not here.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.391
I'm tired of sneaking around,
when are we gonna tell him?

36:32.424 --> 36:33.792
No.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.745
We need to wait until
after we finish this study.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.497
No, you said it yourself,
that's just paperwork.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.833
Listen, I can't risk anything
interfering with the study.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.801
Okay?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.436
I've worked too hard for this.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.639
I just wanna wait for
the right time to tell him.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.377
When exactly is the "right time"
to tell your partner

36:51.410 --> 36:53.379
that you're sleeping
with his wife?

36:53.945 --> 36:58.450
Emily, we talked about this and
we agreed we need to wait

36:58.484 --> 37:00.952
until after the FDA approval.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.222
You're not going to say
anything to him are ya?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.392
Hey, Emily...

37:06.958 --> 37:07.958
Are you?

37:11.430 --> 37:12.430
Don't worry...

37:13.299 --> 37:14.400
My lips are sealed.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.013
Wait, wait are you sure
we should just go in?

38:02.047 --> 38:03.549
Isn't that breaking
and entering?

38:03.582 --> 38:05.092
Well, technically it's not
breaking and entering

38:05.116 --> 38:06.585
if you have a key.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.354
But what if Tony
doesn't remember us?

38:13.659 --> 38:14.660
It's open.

38:20.899 --> 38:21.899
Hello?

38:22.033 --> 38:23.033
Tony?

38:36.648 --> 38:37.648
Is this seat taken?

38:39.418 --> 38:40.486
No, feel free.

38:46.625 --> 38:47.793
My god.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.629
Tony Carter.

38:51.863 --> 38:52.863
Nice to meet you.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.465
Allie...

38:55.100 --> 38:56.735
Allie Anderson.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.712
What?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.180
I...

39:09.214 --> 39:12.050
I think we met Tony at
some sort of medical office.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.004
Hey...

39:36.207 --> 39:37.843
This is Allie's necklace.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.413
She must have come back here
with Tony last night.

39:51.757 --> 39:52.757
It's still cold.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.027
Where could they have gone?

39:56.495 --> 39:57.496
Well, maybe he remembered

39:57.529 --> 39:59.798
he left his car at
the bowling alley last night.

40:00.866 --> 40:01.467
Let's wait.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.634
Maybe they'll come back.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.138
Well, what do we know so far?

40:08.039 --> 40:11.042
Well, apparently we,
met at a medical facility,

40:11.677 --> 40:14.112
went bowling
with Allie and Tony,

40:14.145 --> 40:15.185
and someone is chasing us.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.150
I just can't figure out
how it all connects, can you?

40:19.184 --> 40:20.552
No.

40:20.586 --> 40:21.987
I can't make sense of it either.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.792
Tony?

40:28.059 --> 40:29.094
Wait.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.228
What if it's not them?

40:35.166 --> 40:36.134
Tony?

40:36.167 --> 40:37.167
Allie?

40:38.036 --> 40:39.036
Is that you?

40:41.940 --> 40:44.476
Tony, it's Owen and Stella,
we wanna talk to you.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.149
That scared the hell out of me.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.917
It's okay, it's just a broom.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.096
Stay here!

41:38.129 --> 41:39.129
Somebody's upstairs!

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
Tony!

41:43.001 --> 41:44.001
Hey!

41:49.207 --> 41:50.008
Who was that?

41:50.041 --> 41:50.909
I don't know.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.010
Whoever it was took off.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.746
Can we get outta
here now, please?

42:03.689 --> 42:04.689
My god.

42:05.824 --> 42:06.958
No, no, no, no.

42:06.992 --> 42:07.992
Allie?

42:08.293 --> 42:09.293
Allie?

42:20.739 --> 42:21.339
I'm so sorry.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.674
What's happened to them?

42:22.708 --> 42:23.675
Colour of the skin,

42:23.709 --> 42:25.243
it looks like
they were poisoned.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.244
I don't understand!

42:26.277 --> 42:28.580
I don't know why somebody
would wanna do this!

42:32.050 --> 42:34.119
We-we need to call the police!

42:39.758 --> 42:40.758
Wait a minute.

42:41.660 --> 42:42.694
What are you doing?

42:42.728 --> 42:44.062
Maybe we can find something.

42:47.733 --> 42:48.733
What is that?

42:49.334 --> 42:50.334
It's a parking ticket.

42:50.836 --> 42:51.836
Dated last night.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.676
I- I recognize this address,
it's not far from here.

42:57.709 --> 42:58.709
Yeah.

43:01.647 --> 43:02.881
Maybe it'll give some answers.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.037
Hey.

43:27.673 --> 43:28.673
What?

43:30.676 --> 43:32.644
What if this has something
to do with

43:32.678 --> 43:34.179
why Tony and Allie
were murdered?

43:37.148 --> 43:38.148
Let's go.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.196
Emily.

43:54.700 --> 43:55.934
Wh-what are you doing here?

43:56.868 --> 43:59.270
I was just asking Ben
where you'd gotten to.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.107
You shoulda told me
you were here,

44:02.140 --> 44:04.710
I would've cancelled my meeting.

44:04.743 --> 44:06.945
Well, can't a wife
surprise her husband?

44:06.978 --> 44:08.980
I feel like I never
see you anymore.

44:09.014 --> 44:10.682
You're always working so late.

44:10.716 --> 44:12.918
Well, the trial's
almost over and...

44:13.885 --> 44:15.987
We'll spend more time then.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.021
I promise.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.926
But we have a lot more
work to do.

44:23.428 --> 44:24.930
Alright, I can take a hint.

44:25.864 --> 44:28.133
I will put a plate
in the fridge for you.

44:28.166 --> 44:28.900
Great.

45:02.067 --> 45:03.067
That's my truck.

45:04.302 --> 45:05.436
Let's grab our stuff.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.238
I don't think it's a good idea

45:07.272 --> 45:09.007
for us to keep driving
Tony's car.

45:19.450 --> 45:21.486
I can't believe you're gonna
spend the 500 bucks

45:21.519 --> 45:22.954
on a pair of boots.

45:22.988 --> 45:24.089
I'm gonna be paying bills,

45:24.122 --> 45:26.858
since they're starting to
pile up since I got fired.

45:26.892 --> 45:28.326
Stella, you did the right thing.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.796
Thanks for doing this with me.

45:30.829 --> 45:31.963
You're such a good friend.

45:32.798 --> 45:34.078
That's what
best friends are for.

45:36.501 --> 45:37.168
What?

45:37.202 --> 45:38.303
Did you remember something?

45:40.872 --> 45:41.940
Came here with Allie...

45:43.909 --> 45:45.189
I just can't believe she's gone.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.379
We're gonna figure out
who did this.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.748
I promise.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.251
Come on.

45:57.488 --> 45:58.488
Here.

46:11.002 --> 46:12.002
Alright, let's go.

46:17.843 --> 46:19.544
Okay, here.

46:19.577 --> 46:21.046
ACPI Labs.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.915
That's the same logo
that was on Tony's files.

46:24.950 --> 46:25.950
Should we go?

46:26.284 --> 46:27.284
Yeah.

46:29.054 --> 46:30.054
But let's be careful.

46:40.031 --> 46:40.398
Yeah.

46:40.431 --> 46:40.832
Yeah, yeah.

46:40.866 --> 46:41.866
We were here...

46:42.834 --> 46:46.437
I was sitting there and-
and you were over there,

46:46.471 --> 46:48.239
and Tony and Allie,
they were right here.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.242
Are they closed, or?

46:54.980 --> 46:57.248
If you're here to sign up
for the sleep study,

46:57.282 --> 46:59.317
I'm afraid we're not taking
any more subjects.

46:59.350 --> 47:00.418
That's too bad.

47:00.451 --> 47:02.553
We, were hoping to participate.

47:03.889 --> 47:06.367
Well, we got a variety of trials
that happen throughout the year.

47:06.391 --> 47:08.559
I could have you fill out
an intake form

47:08.593 --> 47:10.495
and we could keep
your name on file.

47:10.528 --> 47:11.262
Sure, yeah.

47:11.296 --> 47:12.296
That'd be great.

47:14.065 --> 47:15.065
Great.

47:15.967 --> 47:18.503
Just give me a moment,
let me see if I can find them.

47:22.373 --> 47:24.109
You sure this is
the right place?

47:24.142 --> 47:25.243
Yeah.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.577
What, do you think
he recognized us?

47:28.246 --> 47:29.246
Here we go.

47:30.615 --> 47:31.615
Okay.

47:32.918 --> 47:35.887
What was the sleep study
for again...?

47:36.654 --> 47:38.023
Danzoset.

47:38.056 --> 47:39.958
It's a new drug therapy
that we've developed

47:39.991 --> 47:42.593
to help people who suffer
from severe sleep disorders.

47:42.627 --> 47:43.627
Right.

47:44.262 --> 47:46.464
Um, I almost forgot.

47:46.497 --> 47:51.069
My friend, um, she was here last
night for the study and,

47:51.102 --> 47:54.605
she wanted me to ask to see
if she left her cell phone here.

47:54.639 --> 47:56.407
She seems to have
m-misplaced it.

47:58.977 --> 47:59.977
What's her name?

48:01.446 --> 48:02.446
Allie.

48:03.448 --> 48:04.449
Allie Anderson.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.387
Let me check the back, see
if anyone turned in a phone.

48:12.490 --> 48:14.159
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea...

48:15.026 --> 48:16.194
I think we should go.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.244
Just try to relax...

48:23.668 --> 48:25.336
Relax.

48:25.370 --> 48:26.480
Stella, you're not
going anywhere!

48:26.504 --> 48:27.672
Let go of me!

48:27.705 --> 48:29.574
You can't keep me here, Larissa!

48:30.308 --> 48:30.675
That's Larissa.

48:30.708 --> 48:31.676
We have to go.

48:31.709 --> 48:32.709
Right now.

48:33.478 --> 48:34.479
Security!

48:37.348 --> 48:39.050
Don't let them
leave the building.

48:39.084 --> 48:40.151
Larissa?

48:40.185 --> 48:41.152
What's going on?

48:41.186 --> 48:41.953
They're here!

48:52.030 --> 48:53.064
Come on.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.341
You go that way.

49:03.374 --> 49:04.009
Okay.

49:23.594 --> 49:24.594
Go, go, go!

49:48.453 --> 49:50.088
I think they went that way!

50:05.170 --> 50:05.803
Hey!

50:20.785 --> 50:21.785
You.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.198
That security guard,
I remember him,

51:07.232 --> 51:08.232
he was chasing us.

51:10.501 --> 51:13.171
Larissa was injecting us
with some sort of drug,

51:13.204 --> 51:15.204
do you think that's why
we can't remember anything?

51:16.607 --> 51:19.277
I just don't understand
what they want from us!

51:21.279 --> 51:23.714
I feel like I'm going crazy,
I'm so tired.

51:24.449 --> 51:25.769
Look, we gotta
get somewhere safe.

51:26.251 --> 51:27.618
Somewhere we can rest, think.

51:27.652 --> 51:28.652
Your sister's place?

51:29.787 --> 51:31.289
No, I have an other idea.

51:39.764 --> 51:40.831
What is going on?!

51:41.399 --> 51:42.600
I don't understand.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.338
Those were two of the test
subjects from last night's study

51:47.372 --> 51:48.739
who broke into
Dr. Cooper's office

51:48.773 --> 51:50.375
and stole some of his files.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.443
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about it?!

51:52.477 --> 51:53.477
Um...

52:03.188 --> 52:05.556
I just don't know who
I can trust anymore.

52:05.590 --> 52:06.590
You can trust me.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.562
Look, I'm really sorry for what
I said back at the hotel.

52:11.596 --> 52:13.564
I shouldn't have
judged you like that.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.335
It's okay.

52:17.368 --> 52:20.205
Look, it wasn't exactly
a usual situation.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.240
It's not everyday you wake up

52:22.273 --> 52:23.574
handcuffed to
a handsome fireman.

52:43.861 --> 52:45.162
We should be safe here.

52:48.933 --> 52:49.933
You okay?

52:51.402 --> 52:53.271
Come on, let's get inside
where it's warm.

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
Make yourself at home.

53:32.343 --> 53:33.444
I'll get a fire started.

53:36.514 --> 53:37.748
This place is really nice.

53:39.016 --> 53:40.016
Thanks.

53:41.486 --> 53:43.654
Yeah, we came here
a lot when we were kids.

53:44.855 --> 53:45.990
A lot of good memories.

53:47.458 --> 53:48.658
It was Lilly's favorite place.

53:51.296 --> 53:55.266
From what Bethany tells me
you and Lilly were really close.

53:56.301 --> 53:57.301
Yeah.

53:59.670 --> 54:01.372
Yeah, Lilly and I, we were...

54:02.507 --> 54:03.574
We were a lot alike.

54:06.911 --> 54:07.945
She was a funny kid.

54:09.547 --> 54:10.815
She could always make me laugh.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.555
And she looked up to me.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.726
I guess in her mind I was...

54:22.393 --> 54:23.628
Some kind of superhero.

54:29.066 --> 54:30.735
It's taken me a long time

54:30.768 --> 54:32.903
to come to terms
with her not being here.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.506
Is that why you
became a Firefighter?

54:37.908 --> 54:38.908
Maybe.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.448
Trying to live up
to her expectations, I guess.

54:58.863 --> 55:00.965
I'll see if I can
find some food.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.570
And the bathroom's
there if you wanna freshen up.

55:06.404 --> 55:07.404
Thank you.

55:07.872 --> 55:09.006
No problem.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.434
Yes, this is Larissa White
at ACPI Labs.

55:36.467 --> 55:38.803
One of your taxis picked up
two of our patients

55:38.836 --> 55:40.505
at the Pinewood Park Hotel
this morning.

55:41.572 --> 55:43.408
I need to know
where they took them.

55:49.146 --> 55:50.481
Great, thank you.

57:01.151 --> 57:02.520
Dr. Jamison.

57:02.553 --> 57:05.122
Larissa, what do you need?

57:06.524 --> 57:08.084
There's a Detective Harrison
to see you.

57:08.225 --> 57:09.225
A detective?

57:10.895 --> 57:12.863
It seems two of the
test subjects are dead.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.038
It seems two of the
test subjects are dead.

57:35.986 --> 57:38.689
This is Detective Harrison
from Alderville PD.

57:39.023 --> 57:40.925
This is Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Jamison.

57:40.958 --> 57:41.492
Hey.

57:41.526 --> 57:42.359
As I mentioned earlier,

57:42.392 --> 57:44.128
Dr. Jamison is running
the sleep trial.

57:44.862 --> 57:47.498
Ms. White tells me that Allie
Anderson and Tony Carter

57:47.532 --> 57:48.772
were two of your test subjects.

57:49.667 --> 57:51.035
Yes, that's correct.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.971
We found their bodies
at Tony Carter's house

57:54.004 --> 57:56.073
after we received
an anonymous tip.

57:56.106 --> 57:57.141
My god.

58:00.244 --> 58:01.078
What happened?

58:01.111 --> 58:02.212
We don't know yet.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.515
We're expecting some answers
when the autopsy reports

58:04.549 --> 58:06.751
come in, but in the meantime,
we were hoping

58:06.784 --> 58:08.986
that you'd have some information
that might help us.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.591
Larissa, If I'm not mistaken,

58:13.624 --> 58:15.192
weren't those two of
the test subjects

58:15.225 --> 58:17.862
that elected to leave the study
early last night?

58:17.895 --> 58:18.996
Yes, that's right.

58:19.029 --> 58:21.031
Tony and Allie chose
to leave the program.

58:21.065 --> 58:23.668
In fact, they left with two
other participants last night.

58:23.701 --> 58:26.804
Can I get the names of these
other two people they left with?

58:26.837 --> 58:28.673
Owen Michaels
and Stella Williams.

58:30.675 --> 58:33.844
Larissa, didn't you mention
that you had to call security

58:33.878 --> 58:35.746
because of how aggressive
they were acting?

58:37.114 --> 58:39.617
When you say aggressive,
what do you mean exactly?

58:39.650 --> 58:42.086
I mean, they were acting
really strange,

58:42.119 --> 58:43.353
really agitated.

58:43.387 --> 58:46.156
I tried to talk to them to make
sense of what was going on,

58:46.190 --> 58:47.457
but they ran off...

58:47.491 --> 58:50.294
A little bit later that's when
security alerted me to the fact

58:50.327 --> 58:52.162
that they broken into
Dr. Cooper's office.

58:52.196 --> 58:53.931
And that's when Owen
had attacked, Rick,

58:53.964 --> 58:54.964
our security guard.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.835
Why do you think
they would've done that?

59:04.208 --> 59:06.844
I think it could've been
a side effect from the study.

59:06.877 --> 59:07.912
No.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.982
We haven't seen any side effects
in any of our test subjects

59:12.016 --> 59:13.751
from any of our trials
we've conducted.

59:14.919 --> 59:17.655
If there had been side effects,
we would've seen 'em by now.

59:17.688 --> 59:20.991
The only thing I can think of is
that they might have been sent

59:21.025 --> 59:23.694
by a rival pharmaceutical
company.

59:28.365 --> 59:31.736
Do you think I could,
have a look at their files?

59:33.638 --> 59:34.171
Sure.

59:34.639 --> 59:35.706
Yes, of course.

59:35.740 --> 59:37.007
I mean, anything to help.

59:37.407 --> 59:39.844
I noticed you have,
security cameras.

59:39.877 --> 59:42.647
Think you can pull last night's
footage for me as well?

59:42.680 --> 59:43.047
Sure.

59:43.080 --> 59:43.480
Yeah.

59:43.513 --> 59:44.513
Right this way.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:02.900
Should really have
something to eat.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.333
I can't.

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:08.939
I just...

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:11.776
I feel like there's something
that we're missing.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.410
I know.

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.016
But we're gonna
figure this out together.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:22.852
It's just...

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.755
Allie's dead...

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.927
And we can't even remember
anything that could help.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.164
None of this makes any sense.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:38.335
Hey, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.050
God, you're beautiful.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:00.157
I haven't felt this close to
someone in a very long time.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160
Me too.

01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:44.468
I don't understand...

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:47.037
But it looks like some of the
security footage from last night

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:48.071
is missing.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:13.163
I'm telling you, she's lying.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.799
Did you see all those vials?

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:15.532
And the needles?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.234
What kind of
sleep study is this?

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.068
We should leave.

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:18.903
We can't.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.537
We gotta figure out
what's goin' on.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.807
We can't let them do it
to somebody else.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.241
Okay, okay.

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:26.419
Um, you and Tony stand guard
and-and we'll take a look around

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:27.945
and see what we can find.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:28.978
Okay.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.049
There has to be
something in here

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.426
that'll explain
what they're doing.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.419
Did you see the size
of that needle?!

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:36.921
This isn't a sleep study!

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:38.823
Maybe they work
for the government?

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.457
Some sort of
mind control experiment?

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.530
Did you notice that-that
there's cameras everywhere?

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:43.861
We have to be careful.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:47.464
Hey, hey, look at this.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:48.665
What is it?

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.877
It-it's a bank statement for
someone named Emily Cooper.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.970
Looks like she's been
transferring a lot of money

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:54.071
out of this account.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.806
Well, what do you think
it means?

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840
I don't know...

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:58.241
Hey.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.410
Look at this.

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:06.316
Chemical compound for
something called Tryzoban?

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:09.586
This doesn't seem like
a sleep study to me.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:12.298
Hurry up, I think
I hear someone coming!

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.261
Let's go!

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:26.602
What?

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:30.975
I need to see the files
from Tony's car.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:46.923
Hi.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.158
What's wrong?

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:52.529
The police were here.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:54.563
Umm...

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:58.002
Two of our test subjects
were found dead this morning.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:59.169
What are you talking about?

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:00.203
How?

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.541
I don't know, but they've
opened a formal investigation.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:09.956
When word gets out about this,
it'll ruin everything...

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.164
Here...

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.232
This.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:29.366
Look at this.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:32.069
I-I think whoever's after us,
this is what they want.

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:35.539
What is Tryzoban?

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.548
That's where you are...

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:53.023
What did you do?!

01:04:57.261 --> 01:05:00.297
Listen to this: "Tryzoban
was pulled by the FDA

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.332
just days prior to
it's official release

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.101
after the promising new
anti-depressant

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:07.004
was found to cause severe
side-effects including:

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:10.074
mood swings, paranoia,
drastically impaired

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:13.310
impulse control along
with severe memory loss."

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:20.417
"In high dosages the drug also
resulted in psychosis and death.

01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:23.220
In light of this development,
ACPI Labs will now move

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.690
all its resources to Dr.
Jamison's Danzoset sleep study."

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:30.594
When's that article dated?

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.395
A year ago.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.201
This Tryzoban document
is dated last week.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.314
You're gonna be getting
a little drowsy,

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.417
and then you may experience
some side effects,

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.730
but it's nothing to worry about.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:57.254
You'll be safe here.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.391
Memory loss,
lowered inhibitions...

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:03.593
They're still testing Tryzoban.

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:11.735
What?

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:12.808
What're you talking about?

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:15.305
I just talked to Ben, he said
the police were here-

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.141
that two of your
test subjects are dead!

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.743
Yes, terrible isn't it?

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.312
This could shut down
the entire study!

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:22.746
Yeah.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.148
Yeah, it could.

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:29.119
Please tell me you didn't
do anything stupid, Mitch.

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:30.619
What?

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.323
You want him to fail, don't you?

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.159
Because of what he did to you-

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.636
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.761
Don't I?

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:39.629
When I was tidying up at home,

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:43.100
I found a vial of Tryzoban
in with your things.

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:45.802
You said that they
were all destroyed

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.471
when they shut down your study!

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:50.507
Well, I-I-I must have
overlooked a vial.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:53.143
You gave it to them, didn't you?

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.445
This is-this is crazy.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.684
You have always been
jealous of him, but this?

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:02.218
Okay, look.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:06.590
All those years,
our life together,

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.259
you're gonna
give it all up for him?

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.728
I know about
the bank statements.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.231
I know about
the money transfers.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:15.599
How could you do this?

01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:17.734
Why?

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.269
All our years together?!

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.705
Years of me waiting...

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.773
Night after night.

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:24.908
For you to come home.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.777
Fifteen years of me waiting
for you to put me first,

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:28.645
before your work.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:29.113
Never happened!

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:30.347
So you know what?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.282
I finally decided...

01:07:32.316 --> 01:07:33.450
I deserve better.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:35.151
Don't do this.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:38.722
You're absolutely right.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:41.191
No matter what you try,

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.493
you will never be half
the man that Ben is...

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:44.628
No, don't say that...

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:45.661
I'm gonna tell him.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.630
Okay, wait!

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.835
I did it for us, okay?

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:53.770
For us.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.317
I'm gonna tell him to tell the
police exactly what to look for:

01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:58.808
the side effects
of the Tryzoban.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.411
You disgust me!

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.270
Dr. Cooper?

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:04.674
Dr. Cooper?

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.841
Can I talk to you?

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:11.514
What's going on?

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:13.883
I'm not sure,
but the door's locked

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.819
and Dr. Cooper's
not answering.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.389
Doesn't usually lock his door...

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.493
Emily!

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:25.895
Emily!

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:26.929
Emily!

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:28.965
No, no!

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:29.765
My god!

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:30.734
No!

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:31.810
Okay, she still has a pulse.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:32.835
Call an ambulance!

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:34.371
Call an ambulance!!

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.247
I need an ambulance to
the ACPI Laboratory Building.

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:10.206
Yeah.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.575
Rick.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.378
I know where they are.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:10.467
We have to call the police.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:15.371
It's Bethany.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.507
Hello.

01:11:17.541 --> 01:11:19.576
Hey, sorry, I just
wanted to know

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.478
if you were coming home
for dinner.

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:23.913
No, I-I'm going to be staying
at the, cabin tonight.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.315
How romantic.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:26.883
I guess things are
going pretty well.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:29.653
Hang on, someone's at the door.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.053
Bethany?

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:36.460
Hi, can I help you?

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:39.728
I'm looking for Owen Michaels.

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:42.899
Bethany, who's at the door?

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.534
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:45.568
Bethany?

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:46.769
What?

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:48.872
Hey!

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:49.905
Bethany?!

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.674
Beth!

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:53.676
Beth!

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.110
Bethany?!

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.380
Bethany, are you there?

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.048
Bethany?

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:04.388
I don't know where you are,

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:07.691
but you and Stella have one hour
to get me the file.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:09.959
You contact the police

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.861
and your sister ends up
like your friends.

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:20.703
Bethany?

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:21.771
You contact the police

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:24.040
and your sister ends up
like your friends.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:29.712
What?

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.046
They have Bethany.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.918
I have one hour
to get him these files.

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:35.585
No, no.

01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:36.986
We have to call the police.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:37.954
No, I can't.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.723
If I do, he's gonna killer.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.761
You should stay here.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:46.129
No, I'm coming with you!

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.188
You don't have to do this...

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:45.922
She's my sister.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:47.757
Just let me help you, okay?

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.926
We stand a better chance
with two of us.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.661
I don't want you getting hurt.

01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:53.930
I'm not letting you
go in there by yourself.

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.963
Okay.

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:01.737
Ready?

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:24.160
Stay close.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.082
Beth!!

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:21.918
Beth.

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:22.951
Beth?

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:25.954
She's alive.

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.156
Beth.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.964
Now you give me what I want,
and your sister will be fine.

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:39.668
Drop it.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.605
Do it or I shoot her.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:42.639
Okay, okay.

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:46.109
What did you do to my sister?

01:15:47.811 --> 01:15:50.614
I just gave her a little
something to help her sleep.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:51.781
Now give me the files.

01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:53.016
Why are you doing this?

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.383
You shouldn't have
broken into my office.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.922
'Cause I had the whole
thing worked out.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.890
You and your friends
made a real mess.

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.592
You killed Tony and Allie?

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.630
I had no choice...

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.065
They wouldn't tell me
where my files were.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:11.000
So you overdose them
on Tryzoban.

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:12.301
Is that what you gave Bethany?

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:21.911
Hello.

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:24.113
Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper from
the Denzoset sleep study,

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:26.215
I just came by to see
how you're doing.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:27.249
May I come in?

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.689
It'll only take a few minutes.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.258
Sure, I guess it would be okay.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.960
Thank you.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:42.264
Hello?

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:44.332
Allie?

01:16:48.972 --> 01:16:50.039
Tryzoban?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840
No.

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:55.812
You know I begged him
to give me more time

01:16:57.046 --> 01:17:00.283
so I could find out what the
side effects of Tryzoban were.

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:05.321
He wouldn't listen.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:09.192
Dr. Jamison
shut me down.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.295
You know he took
everything from me?

01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:19.335
My study, my reputation,
my wife...

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.809
I just wanted to ruin his study.

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:29.078
And I just wanted him to feel...

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:32.816
The same humiliation
that I felt.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.058
But then you and your friends
took my files

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:44.060
and everything got
outta control.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.231
And I had no choice.

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:54.904
So I OD'd them on Denzoset.

01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:55.938
Jamison's drug.

01:17:57.941 --> 01:17:59.008
Give me the file.

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.042
Now.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:04.914
If you want them so badly,
then take them!

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:27.937
Now look what you made me do!

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.532
You shouldn't have done that!

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.207
Leave her alone.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:41.017
I'm afraid it's
too late for that.

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:51.460
Stella?

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:52.494
Come back!

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:54.930
Stella?

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:10.279
Stella?

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:19.087
Come on.

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:22.792
Don't run away from me.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:31.367
Just let me explain.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:37.873
Stella?

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.446
You Bitch!

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:53.455
My god!

01:19:53.857 --> 01:19:54.857
What happened?

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:56.592
Don't you come near me!

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.560
Larissa...

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:58.127
Larissa...

01:19:58.161 --> 01:19:59.028
Thank God you're here.

01:19:59.062 --> 01:19:59.595
I found them...

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.529
I need you.

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:01.197
Shut up!

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:01.865
Don't move!

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:02.765
Okay, please.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.300
Don't shoot, I just
came to help you!

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.534
What?

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:07.512
No, no, no-I-I I don't believe
you, you're working together.

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.372
You're the one
who was injecting us!

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:10.840
Dr. Cooper switched
the vials.

01:20:10.874 --> 01:20:12.417
He gave you Tryzoban
instead of Danzoset.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:14.310
He wanted there
to be side effects.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:17.180
You need to believe me,
I had nothing to do with that.

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.098
But you-you-
you were chasing us!

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:37.400
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:38.433
I called the police...

01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:40.569
We found Emily.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:41.337
She's still alive.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.438
Emily...

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.173
And I'm sure she'll have
a lot to say

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.447
once she regains consciousness.

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:52.647
Put the gun down!

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:57.153
That's him, right there.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.620
Right there.

01:20:58.654 --> 01:20:59.654
Owen!

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.690
My sister...

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:06.095
Larissa, take care of
my sister, she's...

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:15.504
We need an ambulance.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:16.305
Now.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.344
You okay?

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.155
Yeah, somebody's gonna
be here soon, it's okay.

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:14.597
It's nice to see you again.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:16.565
I wanted to come by
and congratulate you.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.334
I read in the paper
that Danzoset

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:19.702
finally got FDA approval.

01:22:20.203 --> 01:22:21.670
I'm glad something good

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.606
eventually came
out of all of this.

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:25.608
You know, it wasn't your fault...

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:27.575
No...

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:30.312
Not directly.

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:33.415
How's Emily?

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.664
She moved back to Chicago
to be with her family.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:40.355
What about you?

01:22:41.524 --> 01:22:43.059
I applied to med school.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:46.195
I thought I might try and
do some good of my own.

01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:47.229
That's great.

01:22:47.997 --> 01:22:48.731
I'm really happy
for you, Larissa.

01:22:48.764 --> 01:22:49.764
You deserve it.

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:51.599
Thanks.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.105
Take care, Doctor.

01:23:07.383 --> 01:23:09.118
Okay, so what about
all this stuff?

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:11.687
No, gotta keep that.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.356
You can't keep everything.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:14.190
Don't worry.

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:15.703
We'll have enough room
for your stuff.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:17.726
You two almost done?

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.738
I just don't know how
we're gonna fit all this stuff

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:21.064
in a two bedroom apartment.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:25.601
Well this is almost everything
I was storing for you.

01:23:26.369 --> 01:23:29.505
I just wish you'd reconsider
and move back home.

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:32.675
I know, but Stella has a great
job opportunity in Colorado.

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.543
And I've always loved
working with kids,

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:36.445
so I think the school
district's gonna be

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.247
a really good fit for me.

01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:40.049
I'm really happy for you guys.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.551
And I've got more boxes
in the garage,

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:44.153
so I'm gonna grab those...

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:45.187
'Kay.

01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:48.323
Hang on a second...

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:51.159
What are these?

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:54.563
You started young?

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.434
I wonder what we could
do with these...

01:23:58.467 --> 01:23:59.202
No.

01:23:59.235 --> 01:23:59.668
Come on.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:00.769
I don't think so.

01:24:05.308 --> 01:24:06.342
You're stuck with me now.

01:24:07.305 --> 01:24:13.216
