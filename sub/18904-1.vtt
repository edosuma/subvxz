WEBVTT

01:28.839 --> 01:30.007
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:30.174 --> 01:32.593
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

01:32.760 --> 01:33.803
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:33.969 --> 01:36.514
<i>- What?
- I'm with Casimiro!</i>

01:45.189 --> 01:47.108
<i>Lunch is ready!</i>

01:47.900 --> 01:50.069
<i>I'm on the slide!</i>

02:05.584 --> 02:07.503
<i>I like Mathematics.</i>

02:07.670 --> 02:09.255
<i>You'll have to work hard.</i>

02:09.421 --> 02:12.299
<i>If I do it wrong,
PH get a zero.</i>

02:12.466 --> 02:14.677
<i>No, you won't get a zero.</i>

02:17.555 --> 02:18.889
<i>Sweetie, time for bed.</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:21.392
<i>Wait, let me tuck in Casimiro.</i>

02:21.559 --> 02:24.061
<i>Come on, go to bed.
It's late, sweetheart.</i>

03:43.849 --> 03:45.392
Pick up, damn it!

03:47.102 --> 03:50.606
Yes, I'm calling for Casimiro's
test results.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.608
Joaquin.

03:53.609 --> 03:58.197
No, my name is Joaquin.
Casimiro is my dog.

03:59.073 --> 04:02.618
Yeah, he's very old.
He doesn't want to walk anymore.

04:05.329 --> 04:09.208
Well, is there any type
of treatment

04:09.375 --> 04:11.669
or operation that can be done?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.673
But it wouldn't solve anything.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.053
Okay, thank you.
I'm going to think about it.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.061
HOW TO PUT A DOG TO SLEEP
WITHOUT PAIN

05:03.887 --> 05:05.472
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.016
Did you put an ad
renting

05:07.182 --> 05:08.350
a room with a terrace?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.311
Can we see it?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.772
Yes, but you should have called
before coming.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.774
Come on, Betty.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.448
It's up there.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.784
- How cute! What's its name?
- Casimiro.

05:25.951 --> 05:26.660
Don't touch him!

05:26.827 --> 05:29.580
He doesn't like people
he doesn't know.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.623
Do you live alone?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.042
Yes.

05:34.793 --> 05:38.255
I don't think this is what
you're looking for.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.424
It's not the ideal place...

05:40.591 --> 05:42.384
How do you know
what I'm looking for?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.387
- Go up and look at it.
- Okay.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.516
The door to the terrace
is next to the bathroom door.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.226
Okay.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.459
Can we move in today?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.294
What?

06:17.461 --> 06:20.339
My stuff is nearby,
I can bring it right over.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.840
You'd be saving us
if you say yes.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.635
- No, no...
- Here's what we'll do.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.929
Don't say anything.
We'll be back in half an hour.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.681
- Call me first.
- Don't show it to anyone.

06:29.848 --> 06:30.891
Please, call me first.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.434
- Half an hour.
- Thanks.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.395
Thanks!

06:47.282 --> 06:48.826
Come in, come in.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.494
Thanks.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.019
This one?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.148
There.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.776
Shouldn't it go over here?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.154
Just asking.

07:27.406 --> 07:30.409
I don't need company.

07:30.993 --> 07:34.079
That's not why I rented the room,
to have someone organizing

07:34.246 --> 07:35.664
and cleaning the house.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.040
What bullshit.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.012
What are these marks
on the door?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.432
The marks...

07:53.599 --> 07:55.476
When you're growing,
as you get taller...

08:03.734 --> 08:06.653
How many lighters
do you use a day?

08:07.070 --> 08:09.198
I'm only thinking of Betty...

08:11.533 --> 08:14.119
Betty, the little girl
who's always with me.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.458
Since you asked, I'll tell you.
I'm a dancer.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.753
That's what I do.
I dance in a club.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.171
I'm a stripper.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.422
But not the kind you're thinking.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.257
That wouldn't be my problem.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.648
FORECLOSURE
FINAL NOTICE

09:00.582 --> 09:03.669
Can you turn down the music
a little, please?

09:07.422 --> 09:08.298
Excuse me.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.717
Have you seen my daughter?

09:10.884 --> 09:11.843
No.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.471
- Could she have gone back there?
- No.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.223
She couldn't have gone
back there.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.516
Don't go back there.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.310
She could have walked right by you
and you didn't see her.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.603
Damn it. Betty!

09:25.941 --> 09:27.693
Sweetie, are you out here?

09:27.985 --> 09:29.152
Betty!

09:34.825 --> 09:36.159
Betty!

09:40.706 --> 09:42.291
Are you here?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.643
Betty!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.608
Betty!

10:10.027 --> 10:12.154
She likes to hide,
I don't know why.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.864
She suddenly disappears.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.408
That's locked, she couldn't have
gone in there.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.244
- Did you check the bedroom?
- Yes, I did.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.662
Betty!

10:21.872 --> 10:23.081
Betty!

10:30.130 --> 10:31.506
Sweetheart!

10:32.257 --> 10:33.258
Come here.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.261
Hide in easier places to find!

10:36.470 --> 10:38.680
Here, let me see your pockets.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.267
I'll put this back where it goes.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.997
Hey, how long has it been
since you saw the terrace?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.709
You know what's out there?

11:49.334 --> 11:50.877
Obviously not.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.048
I can't describe it.
You have to come up and see it.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.051
Yeah, I'd love to go skating too.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.637
Come on.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.318
In the contract
you made me sign...

12:16.027 --> 12:20.115
I saw that today happens to be
your birthday.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.625
You don't like kids?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.336
You don't talk to her,
you barely look at her...

12:33.503 --> 12:35.046
She doesn't talk to me
either.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.799
She doesn't talk to anyone,
not even me.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.134
She's not mute.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.303
She just stopped talking.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.307
The psychologist said it was better
not to pressure her.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.228
Who do you spend
Christmas and New Year's with?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.313
With Casimiro.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.065
That's great.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.276
There will be 4 of us now.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.614
Were you always like this?

13:01.323 --> 13:03.116
Like what?

13:07.746 --> 13:10.665
Shall I take her to bed
and open another bottle?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.752
Come on, sweetie.

13:13.919 --> 13:14.961
Let's go.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.142
I like to dance, but really dance.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.894
You know?

13:31.102 --> 13:33.021
I studied dance.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.900
After that, I came to Buenos Aires,
and...

13:43.448 --> 13:46.117
My old man's house
was full of books too.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.204
There were books everywhere.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.917
You don't care at all,
do you?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.627
I'm listening.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.339
If all you need is money,
why don't you sell this huge house?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.760
This is my home.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.138
Yeah, but this house
must be worth 600,000 dollars.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.223
At least.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.146
What a shitty birthday.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.024
I wish I could dance, but...

14:23.238 --> 14:24.281
Okay.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.411
What are you doing?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.413
It's what I do best.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.832
Here?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.917
Tomorrow we'll just say
it was the booze.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.752
But no laughing

14:37.919 --> 14:39.504
or teasing me about it.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.671
No, Joaquin said not to!

16:45.130 --> 16:47.424
Betty, that's enough!
I won't say it again!

19:34.174 --> 19:35.925
<i>Tell those two to stop
in there.</i>

19:38.887 --> 19:40.763
<i>I heard something
at the cripple's place.</i>

19:40.930 --> 19:42.265
<i>I didn't hear shit.</i>

19:42.432 --> 19:45.643
<i>I said I heard something,
you dumbshit.</i>

19:47.061 --> 19:48.897
<i>It was the elevator.
Lefty, should I take this?</i>

19:49.480 --> 19:51.399
<i>Let me listen.
Keep quiet.</i>

19:53.151 --> 19:55.445
<i>We should have plastered
on this wall.</i>

20:01.826 --> 20:03.036
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

20:03.995 --> 20:05.496
<i>Tell those two come out.</i>

20:05.663 --> 20:06.998
<i>Stay here and listen.</i>

20:11.169 --> 20:13.004
<i>Let's all go back up.</i>

20:19.385 --> 20:21.221
What are you doing?
Come up here!

20:22.472 --> 20:25.225
Don't miss this!
Your dog mummy woke up!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.518
Don't be so insensitive!

20:27.685 --> 20:29.646
- Come up here!
- I'm coming.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.731
Come up!

21:07.809 --> 21:08.810
He got up.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.603
And he stood there
for a while.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.856
Aren't you happy?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.900
Yeah, can't you tell?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.778
Is something wrong?
You look like shit.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
No, I'm fine.
What is this?

21:22.115 --> 21:25.451
This is that I'm not going
to let you keep working.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.038
We'll cook and eat together
to celebrate Casimiro's revival.

21:29.247 --> 21:34.043
I might not do a striptease
for you tonight...

22:20.840 --> 22:24.886
<i>I heard the cripple's elevator
10 minutes ago.</i>

22:25.053 --> 22:25.887
<i>What do we do?</i>

22:26.054 --> 22:28.973
<i>I checked, we're good.
Let's keep going.</i>

22:39.901 --> 22:41.152
<i>Come on,
we need to hurry up.</i>

22:41.319 --> 22:43.112
<i>How are things going in there,
Puppet?</i>

22:43.279 --> 22:44.864
<i>- Hot but okay.
- Puppet?</i>

22:45.907 --> 22:47.325
PUPPET

22:47.492 --> 22:50.495
<i>- What am I, your servant?
- Why are you asking about the heat?</i>

22:50.661 --> 22:52.455
<i>- Pichi, Pichi.
- What?</i>

22:52.622 --> 22:54.832
<i>- Put that over there.
- Yes, sir, but...</i>

22:54.999 --> 22:56.751
<i>We have to be more careful,
Papito.</i>

22:56.918 --> 22:58.586
<i>Keep going,
quit screwing around.</i>

22:58.753 --> 23:01.547
<i>One... second,
let me... turn on... the light.</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:03.174
<i>How are we for 10 days?</i>

23:03.341 --> 23:04.801
<i>Okay, I think.</i>

23:10.098 --> 23:11.349
SATURDAY DECEMBER 24TH

23:11.516 --> 23:13.184
<i>These beams are no good.</i>

23:13.351 --> 23:14.769
<i>Take them upstairs,
they're in the way.</i>

23:15.478 --> 23:16.687
BEAMS?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.606
<i>Mr. Galereto,
should I take this up too?</i>

23:18.773 --> 23:19.899
<i>No, leave it for now.</i>

23:20.066 --> 23:21.359
<i>I'm going up to sleep
for a while.</i>

23:21.526 --> 23:23.111
<i>I'll tell René to come down.</i>

23:23.277 --> 23:25.446
<i>Canario, I'm taking this
to the table.</i>

23:25.613 --> 23:27.407
<i>Whose glass is this?</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:30.827
<i>Pass it over here.</i>

23:32.078 --> 23:33.371
<i>Should we stop at 6?</i>

23:33.538 --> 23:35.706
<i>Yeah, we'll see how it was.</i>

24:23.713 --> 24:25.798
You can't do this to me now.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.551
We signed a contract,
you asked me a ton of questions.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.094
We did sign a contract.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.180
You don't trust me?
ls there a reason?

24:32.346 --> 24:37.185
It has nothing to do with trust.
I just need a couple of weeks...

24:37.351 --> 24:39.270
Why do we have to find
somewhere else right away?

24:39.437 --> 24:41.647
I can't explain why, okay?

24:41.814 --> 24:44.358
- Just give me a few days...
-l'll explain it.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.820
You're scared because
we're getting closer.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.406
Because the other night...
I danced for you.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.409
That has nothing to do with it.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.786
I saw how you look at me.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.248
And you think less of yourself
because of that wheelchair.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.417
You were comfortable
by yourself

25:01.584 --> 25:03.711
and you're scared of losing that.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.215
You're smart, Joaquin
and good-looking

25:07.381 --> 25:10.718
but your life is awful and you
want to keep it that way.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.431
I know you like me.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.685
And you have no idea what I'm
going through and that scares you.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.024
Think it over.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.818
Tomorrow you can tell me
if you want us to leave.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.613
But give it one more day,
please.

25:41.624 --> 25:46.087
THEY WORK ONLY AT NIGHT

25:52.635 --> 25:55.888
THEY CARRY DIRT UPSTAIRS IN BAGS

26:00.643 --> 26:03.437
WHAT ARE THE BEAMS FOR?

26:18.035 --> 26:19.078
Hi.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.830
Good morning.

26:21.956 --> 26:22.915
Want some coffee?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.083
Yeah.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.922
Thanks.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.635
I'm going downstairs to work.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.639
I thought it over.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.726
And... I don't want you to leave.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.312
That's it.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.486
Come down when you can.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.406
I want to show you something
you won't believe.

27:11.922 --> 27:15.635
<i>Schwarzenegger, Schwarzenegger,
when can we eat something?</i>

27:16.052 --> 27:18.054
<i>You want to stop... and eat?</i>

27:18.220 --> 27:20.514
<i>You're lazy even...
even with millions at stake.</i>

27:21.557 --> 27:24.226
<i>This heat is unbearable.
Can't we do something?</i>

27:24.393 --> 27:29.440
<i>Yeah, right. I'll install
some air conditioning later.</i>

27:45.206 --> 27:48.250
<i>It's not silly, according to
our natal charts, it's better to do it</i>

27:48.417 --> 27:50.086
<i>the 25th than the 24th.
I'm only asking for one more day.</i>

27:50.252 --> 27:53.923
<i>Know what the horoscope said about
1/12th of the passengers on the Titanic?</i>

27:54.090 --> 27:57.051
<i>"ldeal day for a trip."</i>

27:57.218 --> 27:59.053
<i>We should do it on the 25th,
not the 24th.</i>

27:59.261 --> 28:01.347
<i>- Trust me.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

28:02.181 --> 28:04.141
<i>Lefty, show me.</i>

28:06.644 --> 28:08.938
<i>- I'm even trying to help...
- Look.</i>

28:09.146 --> 28:10.898
<i>Will it be strong enough?</i>

28:11.065 --> 28:12.274
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

28:12.441 --> 28:14.902
<i>I don't know how it works in Spain,
but don't say I guess.</i>

28:15.528 --> 28:17.154
<i>Don't worry, it'll be fine.</i>

28:18.906 --> 28:20.908
<i>Did you set the detonator,
Canario?</i>

28:21.075 --> 28:22.076
<i>Almost, almost.</i>

28:22.410 --> 28:24.203
<i>But this is harder
than baptizing a cat.</i>

28:24.370 --> 28:26.956
<i>"Almost, almost."</i>

28:27.123 --> 28:29.208
<i>Galereto, you have a visitor.</i>

28:30.793 --> 28:33.963
<i>- What is she doing here?
- Should we leave you alone?</i>

28:36.549 --> 28:37.925
<i>What happened?</i>

28:38.509 --> 28:40.469
<i>I came over the terrace.</i>

28:40.845 --> 28:42.430
<i>Yeah, but what happened?</i>

28:42.596 --> 28:45.808
<i>He changed his mind.
He said to move out.</i>

28:52.189 --> 28:54.734
<i>- Did he go back down after 8'?
- No.</i>

28:55.025 --> 28:56.610
You're sure he can't hear
anything?

28:56.777 --> 28:59.488
He can't hear anything, Javi.
From anywhere.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.366
Keep stalling.

29:02.533 --> 29:06.120
Tell him you'll look
and can't find anything.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.080
Keep him occupied.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.333
Look what I got you.

29:13.836 --> 29:17.465
- Besides the crap you buy me...
- Crap?

29:17.631 --> 29:19.341
Stop groping me.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.178
You don't give a shit
what happens to me.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.430
You leave me with another guy

29:24.597 --> 29:26.474
-and you don't give a fuck.
- He's a cripple.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.936
<i>Or I wouldn't have gotten you into this.
You know Pm crazy about you.</i>

29:31.103 --> 29:34.315
- I wish I believed you.
- What's wrong, baby?

29:34.815 --> 29:35.900
Of course I am.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.030
<i>You're making me horny.</i>

29:41.197 --> 29:43.699
Go on, I have to keep working.
Listen.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.785
No matter what happens,

29:45.951 --> 29:48.537
don't come back here.
It was dangerous.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.080
Message, nothing else.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.374
I'm serious, baby.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.382
Can I come down?

30:02.092 --> 30:02.968
What?

30:03.219 --> 30:04.220
Can I come down?

30:07.431 --> 30:08.599
<i>I'll</i> be right up.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.560
You weren't going to show me
something?

30:18.692 --> 30:20.027
Is something wrong?

30:25.616 --> 30:27.827
Yeah, I wanted to show you...

30:27.993 --> 30:31.080
something on YouTube.
ls your daughter up there?

30:31.705 --> 30:33.541
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be right up.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.129
Okay.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.614
Sweetie, those felt pens
stain everything.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.492
Look at your hands.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.704
Okay, let's see.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.959
Cream cheese, sweet potato jelly,
toothpaste, wine, soap,

32:40.167 --> 32:42.461
rice, cookies, mayonnaise.
Anything else?

32:42.670 --> 32:43.879
Nothing else.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.758
Don't worry, she won't go anywhere.
I think.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.885
Bye, sweetie!

32:56.141 --> 32:58.644
What you're drawing
is very pretty.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.732
It's beautiful, what is it?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.320
Very pretty.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.533
That's a nice color.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.869
You don't want to tell me
what it is?

33:19.873 --> 33:21.750
Tell me when you finish it.

33:25.254 --> 33:27.047
Bye, Casimiro.

33:57.119 --> 34:00.748
<i>- These pipes move a lot.
- They need a brace.</i>

34:00.914 --> 34:03.500
<i>Maybe we should find something
bigger.</i>

34:03.667 --> 34:05.711
<i>Then we can get more
out of each trip.</i>

34:05.878 --> 34:07.546
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:08.464 --> 34:11.383
<i>Look what I found
in Puppet's things.</i>

34:12.509 --> 34:14.053
<i>Where was it?</i>

34:14.219 --> 34:16.305
<i>In the pocket of his backpack.</i>

34:16.638 --> 34:18.724
<i>He sent the last message</i>

34:18.891 --> 34:21.143
<i>at 11 P.M.
He's asleep now.</i>

34:22.352 --> 34:24.646
<i>Get Puppet over here.</i>

34:25.731 --> 34:28.192
<i>Lefty, where did you find
this guy?</i>

34:28.567 --> 34:30.527
<i>You know where. Why?</i>

34:30.694 --> 34:32.404
<i>He sent the address
of the bank.</i>

35:04.436 --> 35:05.771
Why?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.065
Why the fuck did you hit me?

35:10.567 --> 35:11.860
What is this?

35:16.031 --> 35:19.743
Tell me, I'm listening.
What is this doing here?

35:21.245 --> 35:22.162
I didn't realize.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.206
You didn't realize what?

35:25.457 --> 35:28.710
The cell phone.
I forgot that I had it.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.426
Lay on the table.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.977
No, why?

35:45.602 --> 35:46.979
Lefty, pal, explain it to him.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.691
Lower your voice
and lay on the table.

35:51.275 --> 35:54.194
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to...

35:54.361 --> 35:56.405
You'd better do as I say.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.743
I put it in my bag before...

36:01.910 --> 36:04.997
Stop talking. I'll listen to you
when you lay on the table.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.811
Don't tie me up, guys.
There's no need.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.189
I forgot I had it...

36:30.355 --> 36:32.691
It's okay, we'll let you talk.
It's okay.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.569
We're going to tie you up,
it's not up to you.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.655
I put it in my bag
and I forgot...

36:39.114 --> 36:41.783
I forgot, that's all...

36:42.201 --> 36:44.953
Don't tie me up, guys.
There's no need.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.830
You know what?
Let me talk.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.665
You can talk after.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.877
I asked you, like the others,
if you could disappear.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.713
Yeah, I can, I can...

36:54.880 --> 36:57.841
I also checked to make sure
it was true.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.635
And also we agreed

36:59.801 --> 37:01.595
that anyone who wanted to make

37:01.762 --> 37:05.515
a call or send a message
would do it in front of me, right?

37:05.724 --> 37:08.185
Yes, sir. You're right.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.479
I didn't mean to...

37:10.646 --> 37:12.773
Lower your voice
or I'll have to put a bullet

37:12.940 --> 37:14.191
<i>in your head.</i>

37:14.358 --> 37:15.275
<i>I swear.</i>

37:15.442 --> 37:16.360
<i>I swear...</i>

37:16.526 --> 37:17.861
- I didn't know...
- Open your mouth.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.197
No... No...

37:20.364 --> 37:22.616
I'm going to put this rag
in your mouth.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.785
- No...
- This is going to hurt.

37:24.952 --> 37:27.412
You'll scream. I'm going to stab you
in the leg with this screwdriver.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.581
I'll tell you anything.
Anything.

37:29.748 --> 37:33.043
Who did you send the message to
with the bank address?

37:33.210 --> 37:36.213
A girl named Jessica.
I like her.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.006
I met her before we started.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.050
Why did you send her that?

37:40.384 --> 37:42.636
She was angry because
I hadn't written her.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.263
I thought I could see her

37:44.429 --> 37:45.973
when I went to do
the shopping.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.516
- That's the truth.
-ls it?

37:48.892 --> 37:50.560
That's what her messages said.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.980
It's true!
I'm telling the truth!

37:53.146 --> 37:54.731
What a fucking stupid reason
to die.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.317
Don't kill me.
I don't want to see her.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.403
Now you can't be here
anymore.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.446
Because now the girl knows
you didn't leave town.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.449
He told her he was working
near the bank.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.909
See what I mean?

38:06.076 --> 38:07.452
When she hears about
the robbery,

38:07.619 --> 38:11.206
she may be dumb,
but she'll connect you to this.

38:11.373 --> 38:14.251
What if she knows you've done

38:14.418 --> 38:16.003
other jobs before?

38:16.169 --> 38:17.629
She doesn't know, I swear.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.965
How do I know
if she knows or not?

38:20.132 --> 38:21.967
She must know someone
who knows you

38:22.134 --> 38:25.053
from the neighborhood
or strip club where you met her.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.638
You know why this is happening?

38:26.805 --> 38:29.474
Because you didn't tell her
you were out of town.

38:30.017 --> 38:33.020
What's wrong, you idiot?
You think I'm sadistic?

38:40.193 --> 38:41.820
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

38:41.987 --> 38:44.114
<i>Keep quiet or I'll really kill you.
You got that?</i>

38:48.869 --> 38:50.495
If you're a cop...

38:50.954 --> 38:55.208
and the messages were code,
tell me right now.

38:55.375 --> 38:59.755
Because Guttman is in on this.
You know who he is?

38:59.921 --> 39:00.839
No...

39:01.006 --> 39:02.549
I don't know who he is.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.135
If you're a cop, he's the only one
that can save you.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.137
I'm not a cop...

39:07.304 --> 39:11.933
I just want to keep working...

39:13.393 --> 39:15.103
I want to work!

39:16.480 --> 39:18.190
Let me think it over.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.775
Just shut up and hold still.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.443
That's the best thing
you can do.

39:21.610 --> 39:22.986
Let me go...

39:24.529 --> 39:25.822
Let me go...

39:41.922 --> 39:43.006
Keep the cell phone.

39:43.173 --> 39:45.092
We have to keep texting the girl.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.135
What do we do with him?

39:47.302 --> 39:49.262
Guttman can help us out.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.225
<i>Get some plastic and tape.</i>

39:58.939 --> 40:00.273
Afraid?

40:02.150 --> 40:05.654
I don't know, of normal things,
I guess.

40:07.864 --> 40:11.076
Taxi drivers, police,

40:11.451 --> 40:14.121
talk shows...

40:14.287 --> 40:16.623
Like anybody else.
My turn, right?

40:21.586 --> 40:22.629
Well...

40:29.594 --> 40:31.680
Will you ever walk again?

40:33.598 --> 40:34.641
I'd like to.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.186
Maybe with an operation.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.939
Really?
Why don't you do it?

40:41.523 --> 40:44.985
No, let's not talk about this.
Something else.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.862
Okay, fine.

40:47.654 --> 40:48.572
Something else.

40:48.822 --> 40:51.199
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

40:58.415 --> 40:59.458
Ever been in love?

41:00.625 --> 41:01.751
Yeah.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.378
Once.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.797
My turn. You?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.133
Oh, many times.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.011
It's so easy

41:11.178 --> 41:14.055
to find someone
who doesn't just want to fuck you...

41:14.222 --> 41:16.141
Especially with a daughter...

41:18.602 --> 41:23.607
There are plenty of nice,
sweet guys out there...

41:24.024 --> 41:25.901
What does that mean?

41:26.985 --> 41:29.654
It means exactly what I said.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.657
I'll ask you another way.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.622
Are you seeing anyone?

41:40.832 --> 41:42.375
Why?

41:42.876 --> 41:44.878
Are you going to make
an indecent proposal?

41:45.045 --> 41:50.383
No, I just want to see
if you're telling me the truth.

41:58.308 --> 41:59.809
Tell me something.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.439
When was the last time
someone fell in love with you?

42:06.358 --> 42:09.778
I stopped thinking about that.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.658
Don't be ridiculous.

42:15.784 --> 42:18.954
Any girl could fall for you,
with or without

42:19.120 --> 42:20.455
a wheelchair.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.123
Go ahead,

42:22.290 --> 42:26.836
laugh. You think women
are like men. That we only...

42:28.505 --> 42:29.839
What's wrong?

42:31.466 --> 42:33.176
What are you feeling?

42:34.094 --> 42:38.890
I don't know,
like I just smoked 8 joints.

42:39.516 --> 42:40.850
I don't know.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.438
I don't know what's wrong with me.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.567
Lie down in my bedroom.

42:50.527 --> 42:52.946
I think I can make it upstairs.

42:53.113 --> 42:55.991
No, you're not going to make it.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.159
Lie down here, it's okay.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.706
Oh, no...

43:06.209 --> 43:08.670
I don't know
what happened to me.

43:08.837 --> 43:11.339
I feel so out of it.

43:14.718 --> 43:16.970
What are you doing?
Stop!

43:17.137 --> 43:19.723
This is for the dizziness.

43:19.889 --> 43:22.475
- It will help you sleep.
- But...

43:23.268 --> 43:25.645
You can fuck me
without doing this.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.063
I'm not going to fuck you.

43:27.230 --> 43:30.609
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

43:31.526 --> 43:35.780
Because I know everything.
I know what you're doing.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.407
They'll kill you.

43:37.574 --> 43:39.242
They'll kill you.

43:39.868 --> 43:41.369
They'll kill you.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.080
You're going to sleep
for a while.

43:44.247 --> 43:46.082
What about Betty...?

43:46.625 --> 43:48.793
She has nothing to do with this.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.211
Nothing...

43:50.378 --> 43:53.465
Betty will be fine.

43:57.427 --> 43:58.762
Careful.

43:59.137 --> 44:03.516
Are we ready? Just turn.
Try it.

44:03.683 --> 44:06.519
- Are we on schedule?
- I think so.

44:06.728 --> 44:08.438
Take note.

44:09.064 --> 44:12.567
Boxes 747 and 748 are
connected to the alarm,

44:12.734 --> 44:14.819
-but we can't touch them.
- Why?

44:14.986 --> 44:17.697
Guttman warned me.
They're full of cash

44:17.864 --> 44:21.034
but it's narco money.
If we touch it we're dead.

44:21.201 --> 44:25.205
Fuck, what if the narcos
have more money in there?

44:25.372 --> 44:29.334
Guttman is a schmuck
but he isn't fucking stupid.

44:29.501 --> 44:33.046
<i>Write it down:
do not touch 747 and 748.</i>

44:33.338 --> 44:35.757
<i>Look, Galereto.
This is what will explode.</i>

44:36.466 --> 44:37.717
Are you sure?

44:38.093 --> 44:40.011
I'll have to attach it
to the roof of the tunnel.

44:40.178 --> 44:43.014
It should stay there
a few hours before detonating.

44:46.393 --> 44:50.563
Okay, we'll prepare it
the night before we go in.

44:50.772 --> 44:52.816
Listen, we detonate it

44:53.024 --> 44:55.151
and a chunk of the vault
will collapse.

44:55.318 --> 44:58.613
- We can climb up.
- Excuse me, Princess.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.074
The schmuck calls me Princess.

45:01.241 --> 45:03.993
- You'll have to go in.
- Me?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.204
- What?
- You have to replace Puppet.

45:06.371 --> 45:09.457
Damn it!
Can't somebody else go?

45:09.624 --> 45:12.585
<i>- Listen.
- Spare me your astrology bullshit.</i>

45:16.214 --> 45:18.717
I don't know what you're trying to do,

45:19.008 --> 45:20.885
but it won't work.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.016
What do you see in him?

45:30.103 --> 45:34.232
He would never hurt anyone.
He's not a bad person.

45:34.441 --> 45:36.818
He's been good to me
and Betty.

45:36.985 --> 45:41.531
He's a good father for Betty?
That's what you want?

45:51.875 --> 45:54.043
<i>Or in Corrientes, where you were born.</i>

45:54.210 --> 45:55.336
<i>She doesn't know anything, I swear.</i>

45:55.503 --> 45:58.256
<i>She must know someone
who knows you</i>

45:58.423 --> 46:02.385
<i>from the neighborhood
or strip club where you met her.</i>

46:02.552 --> 46:04.471
<i>You know why this is happening?</i>

46:04.637 --> 46:07.265
<i>Because you didn't tell her
you were out of town.</i>

46:08.141 --> 46:10.602
<i>What's wrong, you idiot?
You think I'm sadistic?</i>

46:16.816 --> 46:18.234
ls it good?

46:18.777 --> 46:20.570
Your mom isn't feeling well.

46:20.904 --> 46:23.323
You can see her
when she wakes up.

46:25.033 --> 46:27.285
Know what I was thinking,
Betty?

46:27.744 --> 46:31.748
I'd like you to bring down
your things from upstairs

46:32.290 --> 46:33.291
and you can sleep

46:33.458 --> 46:35.919
in a room down here,
that one over there.

46:36.085 --> 46:39.422
The one that's locked.
It's a beautiful room.

46:39.798 --> 46:42.217
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

46:43.259 --> 46:45.094
<i>I didn't do anything...</i>

46:55.271 --> 46:57.482
So bring your clothes down,
okay?

46:58.107 --> 47:00.485
You can take Casimiro with you.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.695
Is that okay?

47:14.123 --> 47:16.668
Don't be afraid, Betty.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.338
Don't be afraid of me.

47:21.130 --> 47:23.550
I promise I'll never hurt you.

47:24.425 --> 47:25.718
Ever.

47:27.262 --> 47:30.849
I'll never do anything bad to you.

47:32.141 --> 47:34.394
We need to find Casimiro a...

47:35.061 --> 47:37.105
a blanket or something.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.111
Come on.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.599
You can play with anything
in here.

48:13.766 --> 48:15.560
Anything you want.

49:07.070 --> 49:09.989
How long has it been
since Betty last spoke?

49:10.782 --> 49:13.117
When she was 4 years old.

49:13.326 --> 49:15.495
And one day she just stopped talking.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.504
Nothing I told you was a lie.

49:24.671 --> 49:25.546
Nothing.

49:25.713 --> 49:28.508
I believed everything you told me.

49:33.012 --> 49:34.681
What are you going to do?

49:35.014 --> 49:37.767
Maybe I can help you avoid
them killing you.

49:38.518 --> 49:39.477
They won't kill me.

49:40.561 --> 49:44.565
Be careful when you send
text messages from my phone.

49:44.732 --> 49:45.775
You have to put

49:45.942 --> 49:47.485
a space before the first word.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.153
Repeat some letters

49:49.320 --> 49:51.739
-and always end with a period.
- You think

49:51.906 --> 49:54.617
I can't beat him?
I already noticed.

49:55.952 --> 49:57.578
He's going to realize.

50:00.206 --> 50:02.041
I'm going to steal
part of what they take.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.544
Are you crazy?

50:04.711 --> 50:06.713
Three will be in the bank,
three waiting for the money.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.965
Joaquin, you can't do that.

50:09.132 --> 50:12.552
You haven't seen what
they're capable of.

50:13.302 --> 50:15.096
There's no way they'll notice.

50:15.596 --> 50:18.474
Sell this house if you need money.
Why do that?

50:33.990 --> 50:35.700
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

50:37.744 --> 50:38.536
<i>What's wrong?</i>

50:38.911 --> 50:41.122
There's a pipe
that shouldn't be there.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.708
- A pipe?
- Yeah, a large water pipe.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.793
There can't be a pipe there.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.629
The pipe is right in the middle.
Right in the middle.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.757
Did we turn too soon?

50:51.674 --> 50:55.303
This has to be the pipe,
it's the only one.

50:55.470 --> 50:58.139
Then we must have done this.

50:58.306 --> 51:01.225
They turned 2 meters too soon.
How did you fuck this up?

51:01.392 --> 51:04.062
- Spaniards don't know the metric system?
- Shut up!

51:04.437 --> 51:07.190
We barely touched it.

51:07.482 --> 51:09.150
<i>How much time have we lost?</i>

51:09.317 --> 51:12.653
BUENOS AIRES WATER PIPES

51:12.862 --> 51:14.655
<i>We won't make it
to the day after tomorrow?</i>

51:17.241 --> 51:21.746
We have to correct several meters
and prepare the roof for the charge.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.289
Forget about Saturday.

51:24.123 --> 51:26.167
We wait until Sunday
and go in earlier.

51:28.461 --> 51:32.590
- What's wrong?
- This is much better.

51:32.757 --> 51:36.636
Yeah, Mars and Saturn were out of line.
Working 4 more hours a day we can make it up.

51:36.803 --> 51:38.721
- Seriously?
- We have no choice.

51:38.888 --> 51:40.723
Start correcting.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.852
Look at this.
Am I a genius or what?

51:45.436 --> 51:47.480
What the fuck are you talking about?

51:47.647 --> 51:51.025
Instead of the shitty carts,
we'll use this.

51:51.192 --> 51:53.694
We can fit more.
Less trips, less time.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.239
If it tips over, nothing falls out.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.408
Put wheels on it
and we'll try it out.

55:22.903 --> 55:25.865
That's why I'm saying
we need to be careful.

55:26.615 --> 55:30.036
I know that. You think I'm not
careful enough?

55:33.873 --> 55:35.082
Pass me the tape measure.

55:36.542 --> 55:38.169
We need light.

55:46.594 --> 55:48.220
Come on, bonehead.

55:49.305 --> 55:50.806
You'll get covered in dirt.

55:52.600 --> 55:56.062
Here, put it on the table.
I don't want it to get dirty.

56:12.953 --> 56:14.538
The lights are on.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.999
What dumbshits.

56:20.503 --> 56:22.296
Look, these are burned out.

56:22.463 --> 56:25.966
Leaving them on all day
with the heat down here.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.645
- Come on, go faster.
- Wait, wait...

56:44.527 --> 56:45.277
It looks okay.

56:45.444 --> 56:47.321
It's what they said.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.246
- Did you measure right?
- Yeah.

56:56.664 --> 56:59.583
Lefty's taking everything
to the house in Lomas.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.876
That place is perfect.

57:02.294 --> 57:05.548
You mean he knows about
the house in Lomas?

57:06.549 --> 57:08.676
Him, you and me.
Nobody else.

57:11.554 --> 57:14.765
You might as well put our hideout
in the newspaper.

57:15.433 --> 57:18.602
Did something happen between
you and Lefty?

57:19.520 --> 57:21.689
No, nothing.
You're the boss here.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.357
But did something happen?

57:23.732 --> 57:29.363
I just think you're trusting people
too much who you hardly know.

57:30.239 --> 57:32.032
Don't bust my balls, Pedro.

57:32.199 --> 57:33.993
Lefty's a good guy.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.912
If you know something I don't,
tell me.

57:37.705 --> 57:39.999
Lefty's a good guy.

57:40.166 --> 57:44.628
He won't give us any trouble.
He's great at what he does.

57:46.797 --> 57:49.425
Yeah, he's the one
who brought Puppet.

57:49.884 --> 57:51.886
Stop busting my balls.

57:52.052 --> 57:54.430
You always get like this
with somebody new.

57:54.597 --> 57:56.098
You're my brother, I trust you.

57:56.682 --> 58:00.352
What do you mean, you jerk?
That I'm jealous? Why ask me

58:00.519 --> 58:02.730
if you know him better than me.

58:02.897 --> 58:04.440
Why the hell are you asking me?

58:05.649 --> 58:07.485
This is great, a fucking Spaniard,

58:07.651 --> 58:10.196
a stutterer, a lesbian

58:10.362 --> 58:14.408
and a puppet.
What a melting pot.

58:35.429 --> 58:36.514
Betty.

58:39.141 --> 58:40.476
Betty...

58:48.692 --> 58:50.069
Betty.

58:51.946 --> 58:53.155
Betty!

59:29.608 --> 59:30.985
Betty...

59:33.279 --> 59:34.863
Betty... Betty!

59:49.295 --> 59:51.130
It's an illusion they created

59:51.297 --> 59:53.132
to dominate, so people
won't bother them.

59:53.299 --> 59:54.967
I know, I know.

59:55.134 --> 59:56.468
It's true, you're right.

59:56.635 --> 59:59.805
And they call it "ethics."
Like I read once:

59:59.972 --> 1:00:02.224
"What's robbing a bank
compared to founding one?"

1:00:02.641 --> 1:00:03.892
Where is Guttman?

1:00:17.781 --> 1:00:20.159
Falling a day behind
is not good.

1:00:21.702 --> 1:00:23.370
It's not good.

1:00:23.871 --> 1:00:25.289
Of course it's not good, Guttman.

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:28.334
But sometimes unexpected things
happen.

1:00:31.086 --> 1:00:32.963
We're done with the curve.

1:00:33.339 --> 1:00:36.592
Tonight we'll be under
the safety deposit boxes.

1:00:38.302 --> 1:00:40.471
Then we go in the day
after tomorrow?

1:00:42.973 --> 1:00:46.226
The tunnel will end
10 centimeters under the vault

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:49.229
for a small explosive.
We detonate and go in.

1:00:49.396 --> 1:00:52.066
It's faster and we won't need
so many tools.

1:00:52.399 --> 1:00:53.609
We'll go in at 8.

1:00:53.776 --> 1:00:56.236
But then the partying won't cover
the noise?

1:00:56.403 --> 1:01:00.240
On the 25th people light
firecrackers all day too.

1:01:02.284 --> 1:01:03.327
- Lefty, what's wrong?
- What?

1:01:03.494 --> 1:01:05.621
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1:01:06.705 --> 1:01:10.626
I can't find my watch.
I left it here and it's gone.

1:01:10.793 --> 1:01:12.711
If you need to interrupt
for any other

1:01:12.878 --> 1:01:14.588
important reason,
go ahead.

1:01:15.381 --> 1:01:17.591
The explosion
won't be too big, right?

1:01:17.758 --> 1:01:20.594
We used it on another job.
Nobody will hear it.

1:01:20.761 --> 1:01:21.887
Let's go.

1:01:22.429 --> 1:01:23.722
It's going to rain on Sunday.

1:01:24.890 --> 1:01:26.475
That's good for us.

1:01:26.642 --> 1:01:30.062
Monday is when they'll realize.
After that,

1:01:30.229 --> 1:01:31.939
it's your problem, Guttman.

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:37.403
Yeah, and you guys
will be far away by then.

1:01:37.569 --> 1:01:38.946
What's wrong, Canario?

1:01:39.196 --> 1:01:41.740
The tarp looked funny to me.

1:01:46.078 --> 1:01:48.122
I need to talk to you.

1:01:56.171 --> 1:01:57.339
<i>Look.</i>

1:01:57.881 --> 1:02:01.719
These are the safety deposit boxes
you can't touch

1:02:01.885 --> 1:02:03.637
because they're connected
to the alarm.

1:02:03.804 --> 1:02:05.639
- Got it?
- Got it.

1:02:12.771 --> 1:02:15.107
Is it true you're retiring
after this job?

1:02:16.483 --> 1:02:17.776
That's right.

1:02:18.193 --> 1:02:19.528
That's what they all say.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:22.489
There's a girl.
I'm leaving with her.

1:02:23.073 --> 1:02:26.577
Money and the girl I love,
all at once.

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:32.374
Write down this number:
155.

1:02:34.710 --> 1:02:36.503
155? ls that the one?

1:02:36.754 --> 1:02:38.213
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:02:39.047 --> 1:02:41.425
You'll find an envelope,

1:02:41.592 --> 1:02:44.136
loose papers,
it doesn't matter.

1:02:44.595 --> 1:02:47.806
Anything in there
is what I'm after.

1:02:48.557 --> 1:02:50.559
You're not going to tell me
what it is?

1:02:50.726 --> 1:02:52.686
Trust me, you don't want to know.

1:02:52.853 --> 1:02:54.980
If you're smart,
you won't look either.

1:02:56.315 --> 1:03:00.944
Guttman, I don't give a shit
what they're extorting you with.

1:03:01.111 --> 1:03:04.948
Photos banging your mother
or a 3-month-old baby

1:03:05.115 --> 1:03:08.786
or a government minister,
I don't care.

1:03:10.454 --> 1:03:12.915
Everything will be down
on Sunday.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:15.959
I can send the patrols
somewhere else.

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:19.546
But only until 11,
after that I can't.

1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:22.424
Stay calm and don't make
a mess.

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:41.819
Here, give me your hand.

1:03:42.361 --> 1:03:43.529
Come on.

1:03:48.075 --> 1:03:50.077
It's over, it's over.

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:53.747
It's over, it's over.

1:03:57.793 --> 1:03:59.086
Are you okay?

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:01.922
It's over. It's over.

1:04:09.012 --> 1:04:10.222
What's this?

1:04:10.764 --> 1:04:11.807
What's this?

1:04:11.974 --> 1:04:12.891
What did you do?

1:04:23.318 --> 1:04:25.404
Stop, stop, stop.
Please.

1:04:25.612 --> 1:04:26.780
Stop.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.450
Let me go, please...

1:04:31.493 --> 1:04:34.329
He's calling you.
I need you to answer it.

1:04:34.496 --> 1:04:36.290
Please, I'm asking you.

1:04:36.456 --> 1:04:38.792
- Help me.
- Why should I help you?

1:04:40.043 --> 1:04:42.629
Because I'm asking you to,
damn it!

1:04:45.048 --> 1:04:46.258
Let me go.

1:04:46.425 --> 1:04:47.593
You know Betty talks?

1:04:47.926 --> 1:04:49.887
She talks to Casimiro.

1:04:54.516 --> 1:04:57.936
I put a microphone
on his collar. Listen.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:05.485
<i>Come on, Casimiro.
Pm not going to hurt you.</i>

1:05:06.194 --> 1:05:08.113
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

1:05:09.364 --> 1:05:11.116
<i>Come here, I'll give you a kiss.</i>

1:05:13.911 --> 1:05:15.913
No, please.

1:05:16.079 --> 1:05:18.415
Let me keep listening.
Please.

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:19.917
Please.

1:05:20.584 --> 1:05:23.754
You said she was 4
when she stopped talking.

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:24.755
Yes.

1:05:24.922 --> 1:05:27.007
How old is she now, 6?

1:05:27.674 --> 1:05:28.842
Two years?

1:05:29.009 --> 1:05:31.219
When did this guy
come into your life?

1:05:31.386 --> 1:05:32.512
When did you meet Galereto?

1:05:35.891 --> 1:05:38.560
More or less the same.
A little over two years.

1:05:38.727 --> 1:05:40.854
A little over two years?

1:05:43.231 --> 1:05:46.234
<i>Mommy's boyfriend
wants you to do these things.</i>

1:05:47.235 --> 1:05:49.655
<i>We're going to play a game.</i>

1:05:50.906 --> 1:05:53.533
<i>But we can't tell Mommy.</i>

1:05:54.493 --> 1:05:57.245
<i>Mommy will be jealous
if we tell her.</i>

1:05:58.664 --> 1:06:02.000
<i>Boys and girls always play
like this.</i>

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:05.087
<i>Come here, little one.</i>

1:06:06.505 --> 1:06:08.423
<i>Don't be afraid, Casimiro.</i>

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:09.216
No, no!

1:06:09.383 --> 1:06:10.759
<i>It's okay.</i>

1:06:10.968 --> 1:06:13.845
No,no,no!

1:06:20.185 --> 1:06:22.354
No, please!

1:06:22.688 --> 1:06:24.564
She's okay now, she's okay.

1:06:24.731 --> 1:06:26.942
She's playing with some toys
I gave her.

1:06:27.150 --> 1:06:30.570
That son of a bitch!
That son of a bitch!

1:06:31.196 --> 1:06:34.616
Now that we know,
we can help her.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.788
I'll ruin his life, I swear.

1:06:39.955 --> 1:06:43.000
I don't care about that.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:44.918
I can screw him over.

1:06:45.085 --> 1:06:48.588
I'm going to flood the tunnel.
I'll ruin his whole plan.

1:06:48.755 --> 1:06:51.550
I can ruin his life.

1:06:51.717 --> 1:06:54.553
I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to kill him!

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:58.515
Calm down.
I need you to calm down.

1:07:00.726 --> 1:07:03.979
Think about what's happening.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:06.565
And help me.

1:07:06.732 --> 1:07:08.483
What do you want me to do?

1:07:09.109 --> 1:07:11.069
Call him, talk to him.

1:07:11.236 --> 1:07:13.030
Tell him everything is fine.

1:07:13.196 --> 1:07:16.033
That everything is fine.
Not to worry.

1:07:16.616 --> 1:07:18.869
Tell him everything's fine.

1:07:19.828 --> 1:07:22.414
He's calling you.
Talk to him.

1:07:25.083 --> 1:07:26.501
Hi.

1:07:27.627 --> 1:07:30.380
<i>- How are</i> you?
<i>- Fine. What's happend?</i>

1:07:31.173 --> 1:07:34.384
Yeah, I'm whispering
because he's nearby.

1:07:34.551 --> 1:07:37.596
- Everything <i>is okay?</i>
- I can't talk long.

1:07:38.138 --> 1:07:41.558
Don't worry, he hasn't gone
to the basement.

1:07:43.351 --> 1:07:45.604
Yeah, I miss you too.

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:52.444
Not my baby...

1:07:52.611 --> 1:07:55.197
Son of a bitch!

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:57.574
Son of a bitch...

1:07:57.908 --> 1:08:01.036
No, no!
Don't shoot me up anymore!

1:08:01.203 --> 1:08:04.623
Please! Let me see her!
I need to see her!

1:08:05.123 --> 1:08:07.375
Please, trust me.

1:08:07.542 --> 1:08:09.795
- Please.
- Trust me.

1:08:11.338 --> 1:08:13.256
Everything will be okay.

1:10:14.669 --> 1:10:17.672
What, you still think your watch
is going to show up?

1:10:17.839 --> 1:10:19.299
I left it here.

1:10:19.591 --> 1:10:22.093
We're all decent people here.

1:10:25.972 --> 1:10:28.391
It could be in the bags of dirt.

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:34.606
Finally after 500 years a Spaniard
finally brings something to this land.

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:37.400
What's your fucking problem,
Canario?

1:10:37.567 --> 1:10:40.237
Everything I do bothers you.

1:10:40.570 --> 1:10:43.531
Everything okay?
ls it still intact?

1:10:43.698 --> 1:10:45.075
Yeah. It hasn't moved.

1:10:45.242 --> 1:10:47.535
- Did you check the charge?
- Yeah.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:52.999
Don't worry. A piece of the floor
will fall, not the whole bank.

1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:54.542
Okay...

1:10:54.918 --> 1:10:57.212
We did a good job.

1:10:57.879 --> 1:11:00.674
Clear your minds,
don't say anything.

1:11:02.008 --> 1:11:04.844
- Can we get some rest?
- Yeah.

1:11:05.512 --> 1:11:07.264
We go in at 8.

1:11:25.782 --> 1:11:27.534
I'm going to lock the door, okay?

1:11:27.701 --> 1:11:29.286
I'll be right back.

1:16:19.242 --> 1:16:20.368
Do you need to check it?

1:16:21.869 --> 1:16:22.912
No.

1:16:50.189 --> 1:16:51.816
And René?

1:16:57.697 --> 1:16:58.656
What do we do?

1:16:58.823 --> 1:17:01.367
- Everything's ready.
- Then let's do it.

1:17:01.534 --> 1:17:03.202
- It's stupid to wait.
- Let's go.

1:17:03.369 --> 1:17:04.912
We should wait until the right time.

1:17:05.079 --> 1:17:08.541
No, no, no.
We blow it and go in now.

1:17:08.750 --> 1:17:09.542
Okay.

1:17:10.084 --> 1:17:12.378
Pass me the detonator.

1:17:15.256 --> 1:17:17.133
Turn on the ventilator.

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.845
- Where's the wire?
- Come on.

1:17:21.012 --> 1:17:23.973
- Get out of there.
- Let's go.

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:25.850
Watch your head.

1:17:26.017 --> 1:17:28.061
- Get out of there.
- Come on, you idiot.

1:17:28.227 --> 1:17:29.771
Come on, here we go!
Let's go.

1:17:29.937 --> 1:17:30.897
Here we go!

1:18:10.061 --> 1:18:11.896
- Go on.
- Wait.

1:18:12.313 --> 1:18:13.815
Careful, you'll hit your head.

1:18:13.981 --> 1:18:15.566
Tell me if everything's okay.

1:18:16.359 --> 1:18:18.319
Go ahead.

1:18:20.530 --> 1:18:22.532
Pass me that rope.

1:18:22.699 --> 1:18:24.033
Here.

1:18:40.925 --> 1:18:42.051
Come on.

1:21:07.864 --> 1:21:09.407
Come here.

1:21:10.992 --> 1:21:13.452
Listen.
It sounds like water.

1:21:33.264 --> 1:21:35.433
There's water down there?

1:21:36.309 --> 1:21:39.145
René, can you hear me?
ls there water down there?

1:21:50.573 --> 1:21:51.782
We need to get out!

1:21:52.074 --> 1:21:53.784
Bring everything!
We have to get out!

1:22:22.396 --> 1:22:23.898
What are you doing?

1:22:24.065 --> 1:22:25.274
We're not going to make it.

1:22:25.858 --> 1:22:27.360
We're not going to make it.

1:22:29.236 --> 1:22:32.281
Canario!
I can't make it, Canario!

1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:34.158
I can't see her!

1:22:34.325 --> 1:22:36.285
Don't go down there,
it could collapse.

1:22:36.452 --> 1:22:38.663
We need to get out of here!
Come on!

1:22:48.089 --> 1:22:49.632
Canario!

1:22:50.132 --> 1:22:52.134
Canario, you bastard!

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:09.318
Help me! Help me!

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:12.154
Help me, you bastard!

1:23:15.741 --> 1:23:18.536
There's a guy down here!
Son of a bitch!

1:23:19.203 --> 1:23:20.788
I've got him!

1:23:21.288 --> 1:23:24.291
Help me, you bastard!
There's a guy down here!

1:23:24.458 --> 1:23:26.002
He's down here!

1:23:40.850 --> 1:23:42.893
Open up! Open UP!

1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:46.313
Open up, you son of a bitch!

1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:49.108
Open Up, Open up!

1:23:50.234 --> 1:23:51.777
Help me!

1:23:52.611 --> 1:23:54.030
Open up!

1:25:49.728 --> 1:25:51.564
We have to sound the alarm.

1:26:10.958 --> 1:26:12.459
Berta.

1:26:13.002 --> 1:26:14.295
Berta.

1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:17.965
Berta.

1:26:23.804 --> 1:26:26.849
Berta.
Berta, can you hear me?

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:29.351
It didn't go right.

1:26:30.644 --> 1:26:32.479
I killed someone, Berta.

1:26:41.614 --> 1:26:42.781
Where's my daughter?

1:26:44.033 --> 1:26:45.784
I just saw her, she's fine.

1:26:46.202 --> 1:26:48.120
The money's there.

1:26:48.370 --> 1:26:50.748
In the closet, in the backpack.

1:26:50.915 --> 1:26:52.750
I don't give a shit about the money.

1:26:53.167 --> 1:26:54.460
Tell me what happened.

1:26:54.627 --> 1:26:55.961
They left.

1:26:56.962 --> 1:26:58.797
You idiot!

1:27:00.132 --> 1:27:02.718
They'll come back! And what do you
think will happen to me?

1:27:03.844 --> 1:27:05.095
I couldn't trust you.

1:27:05.262 --> 1:27:06.555
Yes, you could.

1:27:07.056 --> 1:27:08.432
You know you could.

1:27:09.099 --> 1:27:11.352
Now you're on your own.

1:27:12.728 --> 1:27:14.647
I didn't risk you two.

1:27:17.191 --> 1:27:18.776
I didn't...

1:27:23.447 --> 1:27:26.659
You don't know what it means.
I have to take care of her, Joaquin.

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:29.495
I have to go.

1:27:29.954 --> 1:27:31.580
Let me go.

1:27:31.830 --> 1:27:33.832
I have to take care of my daughter.

1:27:36.126 --> 1:27:37.878
I can take care of you both.

1:27:39.797 --> 1:27:41.423
We can leave, the three of us.

1:27:42.675 --> 1:27:44.385
Together.

1:27:50.599 --> 1:27:52.142
I'm sorry.

1:27:54.603 --> 1:27:56.605
I really like you.

1:27:57.940 --> 1:27:58.941
But I can't.

1:28:25.342 --> 1:28:27.678
Here!

1:28:29.013 --> 1:28:31.598
We're trapped in the vault!

1:28:56.832 --> 1:28:59.126
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1:29:09.136 --> 1:29:10.179
Over here, over here.

1:29:18.312 --> 1:29:19.813
Over here, over here.

1:29:21.148 --> 1:29:23.984
Excuse me, sir.
You can't be here.

1:29:24.151 --> 1:29:27.654
I live over there.
My basement is flooded.

1:29:27.821 --> 1:29:29.656
They cut the water and they're
going to pump it out.

1:29:29.823 --> 1:29:33.452
Go back to your home.
You can't be here.

1:29:34.536 --> 1:29:36.288
Okay, thanks.

1:29:41.877 --> 1:29:43.545
- Hello.
- What happened?

1:29:43.712 --> 1:29:45.964
I have no fucking idea
what happened.

1:29:46.131 --> 1:29:48.258
Water started coming
from everywhere.

1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:51.136
<i>Calm down.</i>

1:29:51.303 --> 1:29:54.681
Calm down? I have three people
in the vault!

1:29:54.848 --> 1:29:56.016
Where are you?

1:29:56.266 --> 1:29:58.018
<i>Did you get my things?</i>

1:29:58.185 --> 1:29:59.645
There wasn't time.

1:29:59.812 --> 1:30:02.022
<i>Everything flooded...</i>

1:30:02.564 --> 1:30:04.900
Hello? Hello?

1:30:11.740 --> 1:30:13.158
Who is it?

1:30:13.325 --> 1:30:14.451
Police!

1:30:19.957 --> 1:30:22.918
Good evening, sir.
Officer Cristiani.

1:30:23.085 --> 1:30:24.253
- Are you alone at home?
- No.

1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:25.879
My wife and daughter
are here.

1:30:26.296 --> 1:30:28.757
Would you mind if we came inside?

1:30:28.924 --> 1:30:32.177
Please, I was waiting
for someone to come.

1:30:32.344 --> 1:30:34.471
My whole basement is flooded.
All my work stuff.

1:30:34.638 --> 1:30:38.475
I went outside and they said
to wait here.

1:30:38.642 --> 1:30:41.812
Apparently a pipe burst
under the bank.

1:30:43.147 --> 1:30:47.693
And who's going to pay for
my stuff down there? The bank?

1:30:47.860 --> 1:30:49.736
Where are your wife
and daughter?

1:30:49.903 --> 1:30:52.823
They're asleep. With this mess,
I didn't want to wake them up.

1:30:52.990 --> 1:30:54.575
Please tell them not to worry.

1:30:54.741 --> 1:30:57.202
We have to search the house.

1:30:57.369 --> 1:31:00.581
You have to search my house
because of a broken pipe?

1:31:01.915 --> 1:31:04.251
It looks like someone
tried to rob the bank.

1:31:05.127 --> 1:31:07.463
Please, let's not waste
any more time.

1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:10.132
- Okay.
- Go with him.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.353
They're here to see why
it's flooded. It's okay.

1:31:35.532 --> 1:31:37.868
I'll leave the flashlight there.

1:32:53.944 --> 1:32:58.365
If it was a robbery,
will the bank pay for the damage?

1:32:58.657 --> 1:33:02.828
This is only the beginning.
You'll have to be patient.

1:33:06.873 --> 1:33:07.958
No.

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:09.668
No, no, thanks.

1:33:09.835 --> 1:33:11.837
No, no, really.

1:33:15.632 --> 1:33:17.175
I have to go.

1:33:18.302 --> 1:33:20.887
Come and shut the door.

1:33:30.147 --> 1:33:32.107
Give me your cell phone.

1:33:35.193 --> 1:33:36.945
That one right there.

1:33:53.754 --> 1:33:54.546
Here.

1:33:54.713 --> 1:33:56.923
Now you have my number.

1:33:57.215 --> 1:33:59.134
If you find anything strange

1:33:59.301 --> 1:34:01.261
or you remember anything,

1:34:01.470 --> 1:34:03.096
call me.

1:34:05.557 --> 1:34:06.767
Okay.

1:34:09.394 --> 1:34:12.981
Another team will come tomorrow
to take a closer look.

1:34:13.148 --> 1:34:16.026
Leave everything where it is,
don't touch anything.

1:34:16.610 --> 1:34:19.071
I definitely don't want
to go down there.

1:34:19.946 --> 1:34:21.698
The lights should be back on

1:34:21.865 --> 1:34:23.575
-in a few hours.
- Thank you.

1:34:24.284 --> 1:34:25.786
Chief.

1:35:02.656 --> 1:35:03.865
Who is it?

1:35:04.324 --> 1:35:06.034
Police, sir.

1:35:07.744 --> 1:35:10.038
Do you mind if we come inside?

1:35:11.873 --> 1:35:15.919
The police were just here.
They already searched the house.

1:35:16.128 --> 1:35:19.464
Another brigade.
It will only be a minute.

1:35:21.383 --> 1:35:22.843
Okay.

1:35:23.301 --> 1:35:25.095
Sure, come in.

1:35:33.019 --> 1:35:35.564
That's the basement.

1:35:53.039 --> 1:35:56.209
<i>- Yeah.
- They stole the narcos box, you idiot!</i>

1:35:56.376 --> 1:35:57.753
<i>BOX 748.</i>

1:35:57.919 --> 1:36:00.297
<i>You're dead if you don't
give back that money.</i>

1:36:00.464 --> 1:36:03.300
I know these guys,
I can send them over if you want.

1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:05.427
What you're saying
is impossible.

1:36:05.844 --> 1:36:07.179
I can't talk to you right now.

1:36:07.637 --> 1:36:09.931
Give me time, I'll check it out.

1:36:10.098 --> 1:36:13.059
<i>L know you think I'll kill you
so they can't connect you to me.</i>

1:36:13.351 --> 1:36:16.396
I can't talk right now,
I'll call you back.

1:36:16.563 --> 1:36:17.481
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

1:36:17.647 --> 1:36:19.733
Tell me where you are!

1:36:21.651 --> 1:36:22.944
What's wrong?

1:36:24.404 --> 1:36:27.073
- Nothing, go to sleep.
- You haven't eaten?

1:36:27.824 --> 1:36:30.535
Eat something sweet
or your sugar will be too low.

1:36:30.702 --> 1:36:33.246
Tell me.
What happened down there?

1:36:37.793 --> 1:36:40.629
Water started coming
from everywhere.

1:36:40.796 --> 1:36:42.839
It looks like the floor
caved in

1:36:43.006 --> 1:36:44.716
because they were making
a tunnel

1:36:44.883 --> 1:36:47.177
to rob the bank next door.

1:36:48.178 --> 1:36:51.348
At least that's what
the other policemen said.

1:36:53.725 --> 1:36:56.144
Does anyone else live here?

1:36:56.853 --> 1:36:58.396
No.

1:36:58.814 --> 1:37:00.732
No, not anymore.

1:37:01.316 --> 1:37:04.861
Until yesterday there was a girl
with her daughter,

1:37:06.071 --> 1:37:09.908
they were renting a room
upstairs with a terrace.

1:37:10.367 --> 1:37:11.326
But they left.

1:37:12.619 --> 1:37:13.829
They left?

1:37:13.995 --> 1:37:15.372
Yeah.

1:37:15.622 --> 1:37:16.915
They were...

1:37:18.792 --> 1:37:21.503
They were looking for an apartment.

1:37:22.379 --> 1:37:24.506
She said they found one.

1:37:25.257 --> 1:37:26.591
So...

1:37:32.222 --> 1:37:35.225
- Did they leave an address?
- No.

1:37:35.684 --> 1:37:36.476
No,

1:37:36.643 --> 1:37:38.353
they didn't.

1:37:38.645 --> 1:37:42.148
They said they'd be back
for their stuff.

1:37:42.315 --> 1:37:45.819
So if you need anything...

1:37:47.821 --> 1:37:49.030
Right.

1:37:50.282 --> 1:37:52.951
If I ask you for permission
to search the house,

1:37:53.118 --> 1:37:54.911
would that be okay?

1:37:56.162 --> 1:37:58.331
You're already searching
the basement.

1:37:58.498 --> 1:38:02.168
I just want to make sure
that everything's okay.

1:38:02.335 --> 1:38:03.962
The police

1:38:04.129 --> 1:38:06.548
already searched every room
in the house.

1:38:07.632 --> 1:38:08.884
Look...

1:38:09.426 --> 1:38:11.845
I think you're right,
there's no need.

1:38:14.848 --> 1:38:16.933
So the girl and her daughter
are gone?

1:38:17.100 --> 1:38:18.226
No, no.

1:38:35.368 --> 1:38:36.745
Let's go.

1:38:41.499 --> 1:38:42.667
Berta.

1:38:43.251 --> 1:38:45.295
Can you hear me?
Berta.

1:38:46.087 --> 1:38:47.505
Berta.

1:38:48.632 --> 1:38:49.633
What did you do to her?

1:38:49.799 --> 1:38:52.636
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
What's wrong with her?

1:38:59.184 --> 1:39:01.102
I think you and I need to talk.

1:39:15.492 --> 1:39:16.493
Well?

1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.120
It looks like the water

1:39:19.287 --> 1:39:21.122
made the floor cave in.

1:39:43.895 --> 1:39:46.773
I don't understand what's
happening, officer.

1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:48.858
Can I call you officer?

1:39:52.612 --> 1:39:54.406
Why did you say they had left?

1:39:55.657 --> 1:39:59.411
She told me to say
that they had left.

1:39:59.577 --> 1:40:01.997
And why is she drugged

1:40:02.163 --> 1:40:03.790
with marks from being tied up?

1:40:03.957 --> 1:40:06.459
Marks from being tied up?

1:40:07.335 --> 1:40:09.713
Who would have tied her up?

1:40:09.879 --> 1:40:12.674
- I have no idea.
- That's why I'm asking.

1:40:12.841 --> 1:40:13.591
I don't know.

1:40:14.467 --> 1:40:16.386
Why is she in your bed?

1:40:17.303 --> 1:40:19.222
She wasn't feeling well.

1:40:19.389 --> 1:40:23.018
She took a pill, felt dizzy,
so I said use my bed.

1:40:23.727 --> 1:40:26.354
She couldn't make it upstairs.

1:40:29.691 --> 1:40:31.943
You know this makes no sense.

1:40:32.610 --> 1:40:34.696
But I'm telling you the truth.

1:40:35.780 --> 1:40:37.991
Is the paralysis true
or is that a lie too?

1:40:38.158 --> 1:40:39.451
It's not a lie.

1:40:39.784 --> 1:40:41.828
None of it is a lie.

1:40:43.621 --> 1:40:45.749
When someone tells a lie,

1:40:47.208 --> 1:40:50.086
they have to tell at least
two more to cover it up.

1:40:50.253 --> 1:40:52.839
And then four more
to cover those two.

1:40:53.214 --> 1:40:57.969
You reach a point where
you don't even know how it started.

1:41:06.561 --> 1:41:09.355
Listen to me.

1:41:10.231 --> 1:41:11.483
Please...

1:41:23.203 --> 1:41:24.329
Listen.

1:41:24.996 --> 1:41:27.624
You'd better tell me everything
that happened here.

1:41:30.251 --> 1:41:31.878
I swear I have no idea.

1:41:32.045 --> 1:41:33.296
I have no idea, I swear.

1:41:33.463 --> 1:41:36.174
- Did you see her talk to anyone?
- No.

1:41:50.230 --> 1:41:52.398
It's important for you
to understand something.

1:41:52.565 --> 1:41:53.399
You saw our faces.

1:41:53.566 --> 1:41:55.068
We have to kill you.

1:41:55.235 --> 1:41:57.654
I don't know who you are.

1:41:57.821 --> 1:42:01.157
Right now we are death
personified for you.

1:42:01.366 --> 1:42:02.617
I don't understand.

1:42:02.784 --> 1:42:03.993
I don't understand.

1:42:12.293 --> 1:42:14.170
You only have two options.

1:42:15.380 --> 1:42:18.091
You're in a narrow corridor
with two doors.

1:42:19.008 --> 1:42:21.386
The first door is the one
you've chosen so far:

1:42:21.553 --> 1:42:24.931
Play dumb and stall
to see if that saves you.

1:42:25.431 --> 1:42:28.852
But that door leads to
the worst death

1:42:29.018 --> 1:42:32.105
you can imagine.
Extremely painful.

1:42:32.272 --> 1:42:33.773
You'll watch us hurt you,

1:42:34.315 --> 1:42:35.817
chop you to pieces,

1:42:36.943 --> 1:42:39.529
break your bones,
take out your teeth,

1:42:39.696 --> 1:42:42.991
all very slowly,
with blood everywhere.

1:42:43.700 --> 1:42:45.785
It will surprise you.

1:42:45.952 --> 1:42:50.165
How much your body
can take before you die.

1:42:51.624 --> 1:42:54.502
The second door
is the smart one.

1:42:55.086 --> 1:42:57.088
You talk, tell me
everything you know,

1:42:57.255 --> 1:42:59.465
and you die quickly,
without even realizing.

1:43:00.216 --> 1:43:04.262
It's up to you.
Which door will you choose?

1:43:07.807 --> 1:43:09.517
Put the rag on him.

1:43:09.851 --> 1:43:11.477
No, no...

1:43:11.644 --> 1:43:12.687
So you won't scream.

1:43:12.854 --> 1:43:15.481
Because you're going to,
it's impossible not to.

1:43:27.869 --> 1:43:30.038
Are you sure
you don't want to talk?

1:43:45.428 --> 1:43:46.429
Hello?

1:43:46.596 --> 1:43:49.057
<i>I'm outside your front door.</i>

1:43:53.061 --> 1:43:54.812
Come on in, motherfucker.

1:43:54.979 --> 1:43:57.732
- Help me understand this.
- What's going on?

1:43:57.941 --> 1:44:00.526
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

1:44:00.693 --> 1:44:04.030
- Give me back my gun!
- You've got some explaining to do.

1:44:04.239 --> 1:44:05.615
- What are you doing?
- Walk.

1:44:05.782 --> 1:44:06.824
Walk, walk.

1:44:06.991 --> 1:44:08.409
Walk.

1:44:08.576 --> 1:44:11.120
Explain. Why did you call
that cell phone?

1:44:11.287 --> 1:44:15.500
You explain to me.
I have people on the way.

1:44:15.667 --> 1:44:18.211
Explain everything to me!

1:44:20.546 --> 1:44:22.340
Listen closely.

1:44:22.507 --> 1:44:24.884
Where the hell did you get
that cell number?

1:44:25.093 --> 1:44:29.764
That guy sent me a message
saying to come.

1:44:32.433 --> 1:44:33.184
Tie him up.

1:44:33.351 --> 1:44:35.812
No, I'll stay put.
You don't have to tie me up.

1:44:35.979 --> 1:44:38.356
Listen to me.

1:44:38.523 --> 1:44:40.858
In 5 minutes there will be
cops everywhere.

1:44:41.025 --> 1:44:44.320
Yeah, right. And you come
to ring the doorbell first.

1:44:44.487 --> 1:44:45.989
You think I'm fucking stupid?

1:44:46.155 --> 1:44:50.535
Listen to me!
I don't understand this either!

1:44:50.702 --> 1:44:52.537
Don't worry, we're going
to figure it out.

1:44:52.870 --> 1:44:54.247
Look!

1:44:54.414 --> 1:44:56.791
Listen to me, you bastard.

1:44:56.958 --> 1:45:01.379
I don't understand shit here.
Explain this to me.

1:45:01.546 --> 1:45:02.922
Why did he call you?

1:45:03.089 --> 1:45:05.883
I don't know, I swear.

1:45:07.135 --> 1:45:09.345
Bring Berta out here,
she's in his room.

1:45:09.512 --> 1:45:11.723
They have two minutes to talk
or we're gone.

1:45:11.889 --> 1:45:13.766
Put her in his wheelchair.
Guttman!

1:45:14.517 --> 1:45:17.061
Watch. In one minute
you're next.

1:45:17.228 --> 1:45:18.813
No,no,no!

1:45:18.980 --> 1:45:21.941
Don't kill him!
You'll complicate everything!

1:45:22.108 --> 1:45:23.359
Stop, stop!

1:45:23.526 --> 1:45:25.528
Lefty! Lefty! Please!

1:45:25.695 --> 1:45:27.030
Don't let him kill me, Lefty!

1:45:27.196 --> 1:45:28.406
Tell him!

1:45:33.036 --> 1:45:34.746
How does he know your name?

1:45:34.912 --> 1:45:36.080
How should I know?

1:45:38.041 --> 1:45:39.500
Talk!

1:45:41.377 --> 1:45:43.338
Tell him or I will.

1:45:43.796 --> 1:45:45.465
Tell him.

1:45:46.049 --> 1:45:47.383
Please.

1:45:48.217 --> 1:45:52.722
Talk, motherfucker!
How the hell do you know him?

1:45:52.889 --> 1:45:55.266
Please, Lefty. Tell him.

1:45:55.850 --> 1:45:59.062
I have no fucking idea
what he's talking about.

1:45:59.228 --> 1:46:01.105
I don't know him.

1:46:02.065 --> 1:46:04.817
You have 3 seconds
before I blow your head off.

1:46:08.112 --> 1:46:12.575
In the evening...
he'd sneak up to the terrace.

1:46:13.576 --> 1:46:14.786
To see Berta.

1:46:16.079 --> 1:46:17.288
What?

1:46:17.455 --> 1:46:18.790
He told me about the robbery.

1:46:18.956 --> 1:46:21.376
He's making this up!

1:46:21.542 --> 1:46:23.127
Let him talk!

1:46:23.294 --> 1:46:25.463
He and Berta told me
about the robbery.

1:46:26.172 --> 1:46:28.674
About the tunnel.

1:46:28.883 --> 1:46:32.345
He said to make a hole
in my basement

1:46:32.512 --> 1:46:35.056
to grab the money
from the carts.

1:46:35.765 --> 1:46:38.601
We were going to split it
three ways.

1:46:38.768 --> 1:46:41.979
But then you changed
to cat carriers.

1:46:42.146 --> 1:46:44.023
Son of a bitch!

1:46:44.273 --> 1:46:46.442
I told you he was a son of a bitch!

1:46:46.609 --> 1:46:48.236
He's making it all up, I swear!

1:46:48.403 --> 1:46:50.696
I'm making it up?

1:46:51.239 --> 1:46:55.201
He tied up Berta.
He beat her, I don't know why.

1:46:55.410 --> 1:46:57.453
He wanted to keep her asleep.

1:46:57.620 --> 1:47:01.416
He gave me injections
to keep her drugged.

1:47:01.582 --> 1:47:04.502
He didn't trust her
and he was afraid she'd talk.

1:47:04.669 --> 1:47:07.839
You're doing her, is that it?

1:47:10.675 --> 1:47:11.592
Galereto?

1:47:13.094 --> 1:47:14.137
You're Galereto,

1:47:14.679 --> 1:47:16.139
right?

1:47:16.931 --> 1:47:19.058
And you're Canario, right?

1:47:19.350 --> 1:47:22.145
You three are going to hide
in a house in Lomas?

1:47:25.231 --> 1:47:27.108
Nobody else knew about that.

1:47:27.316 --> 1:47:29.861
I have no fucking idea
how he knows that.

1:47:30.111 --> 1:47:32.447
Shut the fuck up
and let him talk!

1:47:35.408 --> 1:47:37.702
Look, there's a key in that drawer.

1:47:38.327 --> 1:47:39.328
Open the door.

1:47:40.163 --> 1:47:41.581
You'll see I'm not lying.

1:48:08.774 --> 1:48:10.860
He left it here.

1:48:22.788 --> 1:48:23.539
Pedro, no!

1:48:24.874 --> 1:48:27.543
No,no,no!

1:48:27.710 --> 1:48:30.296
Pedro, it's okay.

1:48:30.463 --> 1:48:34.425
No,no,no!
It's okay, bro.

1:48:35.593 --> 1:48:37.720
Don't go...

1:48:39.430 --> 1:48:40.932
Don't go...

1:49:20.388 --> 1:49:21.889
Son of a bitch!

1:49:23.224 --> 1:49:24.600
Son of a bitch...

1:49:24.767 --> 1:49:27.395
Fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch!

1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:45.788
Sweetheart...

1:49:45.955 --> 1:49:49.834
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

1:49:50.001 --> 1:49:52.712
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1:49:55.423 --> 1:49:57.717
That's it, it's over.
That's it.

1:50:12.940 --> 1:50:14.191
You need to go.

1:50:14.775 --> 1:50:17.486
Please, get her out of here.

1:50:18.070 --> 1:50:19.572
She needs to get out of here.

1:50:20.489 --> 1:50:22.575
Stay where you are!

1:50:30.541 --> 1:50:31.876
In the end...

1:50:32.585 --> 1:50:35.713
no matter how organized
your plan is,

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:37.882
it always depends on
either a girl or luck.

1:50:39.300 --> 1:50:41.135
Stop aiming that at me.

1:50:41.302 --> 1:50:44.180
What are you going to do,
bury 4 bodies in the basement?

1:50:46.474 --> 1:50:49.435
So you stole his girlfriend.

1:50:51.145 --> 1:50:53.564
Of course, that's my job,
you know.

1:50:56.484 --> 1:50:58.319
To know everything.

1:51:06.243 --> 1:51:09.205
Scrub the stains
with oxygenated water.

1:51:10.706 --> 1:51:12.917
That's the only thing
that gets the blood out.

1:51:15.503 --> 1:51:16.879
Okay.

1:51:18.464 --> 1:51:21.050
Where's the money you took?

1:51:23.803 --> 1:51:29.058
I take half the money,
and you think about all the things

1:51:29.225 --> 1:51:31.936
I won't do to screw up your life.

1:51:38.192 --> 1:51:39.902
I can screw up your life too.

1:51:49.537 --> 1:51:54.709
<i>These are the safety deposit boxes
you can't touch</i>

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.170
<i>because they're connected
to the alarm.</i>

1:51:58.796 --> 1:52:00.381
<i>It's true that after...</i>

1:52:21.610 --> 1:52:24.989
What you've got there only saves you
for the time being.

1:52:26.490 --> 1:52:28.909
The time being, that's all.

1:52:38.252 --> 1:52:40.463
Pick which one goes first.

1:52:51.724 --> 1:52:54.226
The backpack with the money
is right there.

1:53:04.528 --> 1:53:07.239
Erase what you've got there,
trust me.

1:53:09.909 --> 1:53:12.453
Believe me, you can't afford it.

1:53:21.003 --> 1:53:22.713
In the end...

1:53:23.255 --> 1:53:25.257
Like I said before.

1:53:25.716 --> 1:53:29.887
Everything depends on a girl
or luck.
