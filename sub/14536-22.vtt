WEBVTT

00:06.198 --> 00:07.275
Hey, guys, I'll be right back.

00:07.299 --> 00:10.350
Hey, we're decorating a tree.
It's your favorite thing to do.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.236
Besides not wearing makeup.

00:12.271 --> 00:15.664
Oh, I just have some last-minute
Christmas shopping to do.

00:15.699 --> 00:17.599
KC, the malls are closing.

00:17.634 --> 00:20.735
Then I better get there, huh?

00:20.771 --> 00:22.729
Was she acting a little weird?

00:22.764 --> 00:24.014
No weirder than usual.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.692
MAN: Yes?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.412
Hey, um...

00:39.448 --> 00:40.680
can we talk?

00:40.716 --> 00:42.491
Sure. Come on in.

00:48.098 --> 00:51.474
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

00:51.510 --> 00:54.602
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

00:54.638 --> 00:57.514
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

00:57.549 --> 01:02.661
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:02.696 --> 01:06.398
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:06.433 --> 01:08.525
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:08.560 --> 01:12.537
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:12.573 --> 01:16.541
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:16.577 --> 01:18.577
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

01:18.612 --> 01:20.887
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

01:20.922 --> 01:23.072
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

01:23.108 --> 01:25.183
¶ But I always got your back ¶

01:25.218 --> 01:27.027
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

01:27.062 --> 01:29.271
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

01:29.306 --> 01:31.865
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

01:31.900 --> 01:33.216
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

01:33.251 --> 01:35.585
I keep it undercover.

01:35.621 --> 01:36.621
I keep it undercover.

01:40.768 --> 01:45.387
You don't have to
lie on the couch.

01:45.422 --> 01:47.575
Oh, I know, but that's
how they do it on TV and movies,

01:47.599 --> 01:51.059
plus I'm a little tired,
so two birds, one stone.

01:51.095 --> 01:53.578
Do you always find it necessary

01:53.614 --> 01:55.497
to deflect your feelings
with jokes?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.616
What? No.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.409
Just most of the time.

01:59.444 --> 02:01.436
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

02:01.471 --> 02:03.038
I don't even know why I'm here.

02:03.073 --> 02:05.106
I don't wanna mess up
your Christmas Eve.

02:05.142 --> 02:06.783
My name is Dr. Levinstein.
I'm in no rush.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.088
So, uh, what exactly
is bothering you?

02:12.123 --> 02:14.874
( Sighs ) Nothing.

02:14.910 --> 02:16.518
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.020
( laughs nervously )

02:19.056 --> 02:22.415
It's just that, you know,

02:22.451 --> 02:25.735
being a spy is really
messing with my head.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.746
It's got me feeling like
a total wreck.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.922
Sometimes I can handle it,
but just recently,

02:29.958 --> 02:33.502
with all these missions
and going undercover

02:33.537 --> 02:35.590
as all these different people
I just start feeling like,

02:35.614 --> 02:38.323
who the heck is KC?

02:38.400 --> 02:40.883
You know? And I'm sure
it's not an unusual feeling

02:40.919 --> 02:42.528
for a spy, right?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.362
No, not at all.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.608
Excuse me for just one second.

02:47.643 --> 02:49.534
Yeah, it's me.
I'm going to be late.

02:52.405 --> 02:55.256
KC, maybe these feelings
are exacerbated

02:55.291 --> 02:57.025
because you're so young.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.703
Young? Yeah, well,
today I'm young,

02:59.738 --> 03:02.931
but a lot of the times, I'm not.

03:03.008 --> 03:06.384
( British accent ) Well, hello,
fellow educators.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.947
Substitute teacher
Margaret Cavendish

03:10.982 --> 03:12.515
reporting for duty.

03:16.713 --> 03:19.589
Oh, yes!

03:19.624 --> 03:23.368
Nothing like the smell of
uneducated minds, am I right?

03:23.445 --> 03:26.195
Makes you just want to
fill them up with knowledge.

03:26.231 --> 03:27.511
Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge!

03:30.327 --> 03:34.229
Well, before I start
edificating these young minds,

03:34.264 --> 03:36.181
I'm going to rest
my weary bones.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.499
Excuse me.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.689
Oh, how kind of you
to squeeze me in, buttercup.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.768
You know, back in my day,

03:47.844 --> 03:50.729
we didn't allow students
in the teachers' lounge.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.656
Well, actually, I am a teacher.

03:53.692 --> 03:57.986
Oh, but you are just a pup!

03:58.021 --> 04:00.247
A little bitty puppy.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.065
Thank you.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.870
Oh. Oh, heavens.

04:06.905 --> 04:09.238
I should have never had

04:09.274 --> 04:11.174
those bangers
and mash for lunch.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.868
The gas is starting.

04:12.903 --> 04:13.903
( Passes gas )

04:15.831 --> 04:17.200
Would you be a dear
and get me some tea?

04:17.224 --> 04:18.873
Gladly.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.736
It sounds to me like
you're putting

04:22.771 --> 04:24.863
a little extra pressure
on yourself.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.098
I bet, one day,
when you're a little old lady,

04:27.133 --> 04:29.017
you're gonna look back on this

04:29.052 --> 04:31.444
and remember
these experiences fondly.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.980
Well, hopefully more fondly
than the last time

04:34.015 --> 04:35.015
I was a little old man.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.173
Hey, how you doin'?
Bernie Burns.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.850
Only two things
visible from space.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.969
The Great Wall of China
and that ugly shirt.

04:48.005 --> 04:50.254
Hey oh!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.690
You just got burned
by Bernie Burns.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.176
Oh, man, look at these two.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.612
More wrinkles than
a box of raisins.

04:56.646 --> 04:59.138
Hey oh!

04:59.174 --> 05:02.526
Burned by the Burnster. Hey.

05:02.561 --> 05:05.012
Bernie Burns here. I used
to be a nightclub comedian.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.774
You know what happened
when I played Atlantic City?

05:06.798 --> 05:09.849
Everyone left
and went to Vegas. Hey oh!

05:09.884 --> 05:11.276
I just burned myself.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.594
Nobody's off limits.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.167
Maybe you should dwell
on the positive.

05:19.202 --> 05:20.329
It seems to me that you're
genuinely good at this work,

05:20.353 --> 05:22.286
portraying other people.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.973
Yeah, usually I am,
but not always.

05:26.009 --> 05:28.129
There was this one time
I had to do it on truth serum.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.569
My, my, my.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.074
And a good afternoon to you.

05:35.110 --> 05:36.818
Mr. Tochlin, I presume.

05:36.853 --> 05:38.119
Mrs. DuBois, I presume.

05:38.155 --> 05:40.430
Well, you presume wrong.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.090
Excuse me?

05:42.125 --> 05:45.427
My friends, they call me KC.

05:45.462 --> 05:47.062
I hope you'll call me
KC, too, all right.

05:47.088 --> 05:48.088
Everybody calls me KC.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.076
Okay.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.795
Uh, Mrs. DuBois...

05:55.830 --> 05:57.097
Mm-mm.

05:57.132 --> 05:58.940
KC.

05:58.976 --> 06:00.834
( Chuckles )

06:00.869 --> 06:02.260
It says here that
Marisa worked as

06:02.295 --> 06:03.753
your part-time
personal assistant.

06:03.788 --> 06:07.732
Yes. That is what it says.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.651
Those words are on that paper.

06:12.447 --> 06:15.915
Uh, you know, Marisa,
she is a lovely gal.

06:15.950 --> 06:19.477
She's vivacious, good humored,

06:19.512 --> 06:21.272
sweeter than a sugar cake
on a baby's bottom.

06:22.957 --> 06:25.391
Well, I should go now.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.085
Here is a can of
creamed corn for y'all.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.895
Have a good day, darlin'.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.581
Um, just a few more questions.

06:31.616 --> 06:32.874
Please. Since you're here.

06:32.909 --> 06:34.592
Oh. Goody goody gumdrops.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.259
So how long
have you known Marisa?

06:39.283 --> 06:42.025
Since I was five.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.460
You mean since she was five.

06:44.496 --> 06:48.323
Yes. That is true.

06:48.358 --> 06:51.810
I have known Marisa
since she was five.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.085
We used to take baths together.

06:56.532 --> 06:58.900
Can we wrap this up now?

06:58.935 --> 07:01.628
Uh, we're almost finished.

07:01.705 --> 07:03.545
Would you say that Marisa
is generally on time?

07:03.573 --> 07:05.498
Oh, yes, absolutely.
She is always on time.

07:08.586 --> 07:11.980
For a party or a sale.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.260
Not for anything really important
when you're countin' on her.

07:14.284 --> 07:17.602
Thank you for your candor.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.679
I have just one more question.

07:19.714 --> 07:21.623
If you were me,

07:21.658 --> 07:23.141
would you hire Marisa
for this job?

07:23.176 --> 07:26.535
No!

07:26.571 --> 07:28.897
No, no, no.
No way, absolutely not.

07:28.932 --> 07:31.007
Negatory. Nope.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.818
And if I wasn't
clear before, no!

07:32.853 --> 07:35.578
Wow. Uh, well,

07:35.613 --> 07:37.413
is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

07:37.448 --> 07:38.648
You look like a sleepy turtle.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.495
Where I come from, dear,
that's a compliment.

07:45.490 --> 07:46.956
No, it's not.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.830
Ernie, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:59.763 --> 08:02.105
She must be trying to get me
under the mistletoe.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.099
What the heck? It's Christmas.

08:05.134 --> 08:07.143
Let me go share
the gift that is Ernie.

08:08.997 --> 08:11.064
You might wanna
keep the receipt.

08:14.110 --> 08:16.477
I'm worried about KC.

08:16.513 --> 08:16.894
I don't think she went out
to buy presents.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.554
Why not?

08:18.589 --> 08:20.807
Because she's so organized.

08:20.842 --> 08:23.317
She has her Christmas shopping
done by Easter.

08:23.353 --> 08:25.086
I think she might be upset
about something.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.047
You're being ridiculous.

08:27.082 --> 08:29.607
KC is the most together
person I know.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.002
I just feel like
I'm falling apart.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.219
I think part of the anxiety
you're feeling

08:41.254 --> 08:42.995
stems from the fact
that going undercover

08:43.031 --> 08:45.915
can be lonely work.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.470
Well, I mean, sometimes
I get to go with another agent.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.728
And that's better?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.104
No, it's worse.

08:56.853 --> 08:58.027
Simone, come on.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.778
This is ridiculous.

09:07.814 --> 09:11.432
No one in their right mind
is gonna believe I'm a man.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.751
Not with all this
curvaceousness-ness.

09:16.615 --> 09:19.591
Would you stop whining,
okay, and dude up?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.917
I'm sorry, KC,

09:21.953 --> 09:24.062
but this undercover stuff
is just not my bailiwick.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.647
Rule number one of being a dude.

09:25.682 --> 09:28.257
You don't wanna use words
like bailiwick.

09:28.293 --> 09:30.285
I don't know if
I can do this, all right?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.637
I'm just so nervous.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.083
How many times
do I have to tell you,

09:34.107 --> 09:35.156
I am not a field agent?

09:35.191 --> 09:36.941
I was hoping just 12!

09:38.995 --> 09:40.820
Because if I hear it again,
I swear,

09:40.855 --> 09:42.415
I am sticking this
plunger up your nose.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.231
How dare you speak to
a lady that way?

09:48.472 --> 09:51.030
Look, relax, okay?

09:51.066 --> 09:52.418
If anyone comes,
I will do all the talking.

09:52.442 --> 09:54.267
Got it. Yes.
You do all the talking.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.336
I will keep it quiet.

09:56.371 --> 09:58.671
No matter what happens,
my lips are zip, zip, zip.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.418
We need paper towels
in the men's room.

10:03.453 --> 10:05.520
( Deep voice )
We need paper towels?

10:05.597 --> 10:08.682
You need paper towels?
You always need paper towels.

10:08.717 --> 10:10.803
Everybody need paper towels. Paper
towels, paper towels, paper towels.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.703
When I was in my generation,
back when I was fly,

10:13.739 --> 10:16.222
we used to have paper
and we used to have towels.

10:16.257 --> 10:18.040
We used to have
paper to write with,

10:18.076 --> 10:20.167
and towels to wipe with,
but now you want

10:20.203 --> 10:22.028
all the paper towels
together, don't ya?

10:22.063 --> 10:24.814
Paper towels, paper...
take your paper towels

10:24.849 --> 10:27.107
and get back in that room!

10:27.143 --> 10:28.951
Nobody wants to use you
or your paper towels.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.927
It occurs to me that you need
a creative outlet

10:37.962 --> 10:40.229
to relieve your stress.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.999
Many of my patients
really enjoy art therapy.

10:43.034 --> 10:45.985
Oh, yeah, I've dabbled
in art before.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.020
Not really my thing.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.966
I am Lola Fingers.

10:52.001 --> 10:55.261
Artiste.

10:55.296 --> 10:57.313
And I'm her manager,
Tommy Lasorda.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.351
The artiste manager.

11:01.386 --> 11:03.611
Not the baseball manager.

11:03.646 --> 11:05.772
He's a large white man,
and I'm a short black guy,

11:05.807 --> 11:07.240
with a penchant for turtlenecks.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.821
Your work is genius.
As is your hair.

11:12.856 --> 11:16.224
Yeah, well, my style
is perpetually

11:16.259 --> 11:17.500
caught in a breeze.

11:19.587 --> 11:23.222
To remind me that life
is always moving,

11:23.258 --> 11:25.591
as must art.

11:26.994 --> 11:29.687
Oh, yes.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.156
This space is perfect.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.650
It's bare.

11:34.686 --> 11:36.719
It's naked.

11:36.754 --> 11:38.354
I'll cover your shame,
naked wall.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.393
With art!

11:43.428 --> 11:46.545
She'll need total privacy.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.975
Her most creative hours
are 2:00 to 5:00 a.m.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.540
You've got it, Lola.

11:49.575 --> 11:52.377
But it would be an honor

11:52.412 --> 11:53.532
to come by and see you work.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.073
Why wait?

11:57.108 --> 11:59.450
She can do one right now.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.827
Lola's known for
her spontaneous paintings.

12:01.863 --> 12:05.131
Yes. I'm also known for
firing my manager.

12:05.166 --> 12:08.526
Come on, Lola.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.320
Do the one where
you roll around in...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.381
Why am I explaining
when she can just show you?

12:13.416 --> 12:15.750
Lola.

12:15.785 --> 12:18.352
No, thank you. I'm just
not feeling the muse right now.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.508
Then let me help you feel it.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.670
Oh, yes.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.331
I'm not done, I'm not done.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.351
Oh, lovely.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.371
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm really
starting to feel it

12:36.406 --> 12:37.588
everywhere now.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.499
Yes!

12:44.438 --> 12:46.814
Lola, you've done it again.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.050
Don't hold back.
Rage is your medium.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.263
I love it.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.820
Yes, Lola, you've done it again.

13:00.855 --> 13:03.731
Eh. I wouldn't say
it's your best work.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.620
Oh, really?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.989
Oh, lovely.

13:17.322 --> 13:18.871
Look at that.

13:18.907 --> 13:21.816
Another Lola Fingers original.

13:21.851 --> 13:23.751
Allow me to sign it for you.

13:29.926 --> 13:31.851
Okay, so what I'm hearing is,

13:31.886 --> 13:33.736
you have fun
working with your family.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.955
Oh, yeah.

13:35.991 --> 13:38.483
Yeah, I do. A lot.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.020
So no conflicts come up
because of work.

13:40.044 --> 13:41.969
There's never any fighting.

13:42.005 --> 13:43.813
Fighting? Between people
in my family? No.

13:43.848 --> 13:45.740
Absolutely not.

13:45.775 --> 13:47.942
Unless you count my mom.

13:47.977 --> 13:50.378
You know I love you,
but I gotta mess you up.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.695
Excuse me?

13:51.731 --> 13:53.706
Scar said that I
had to fight you.

13:53.741 --> 13:56.800
Oh. In that case, hit me hard.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.329
What? I don't want to.
You're my mommy.

14:00.365 --> 14:02.899
And your mommy is saying hit me.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.561
Come on. This'll just be
like sparring practice at home.

14:04.585 --> 14:06.768
- Okay.
- All right.

14:06.804 --> 14:07.924
I'm gonna hit you now, okay?

14:12.402 --> 14:14.260
What are you doing?

14:14.296 --> 14:16.496
I'm not gonna make it
easy on you.

14:16.531 --> 14:18.211
Hit me again, delinquent!
See what happens.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.893
INMATES: Fight, fight,
fight, fight!

14:30.861 --> 14:32.995
- Nice kick, Mom.
- Thanks.

14:33.030 --> 14:34.972
Hey, wanna do
that over-the-table thing?

14:35.007 --> 14:36.007
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay.

14:40.663 --> 14:42.671
It seems to me you really
didn't have a choice.

14:42.706 --> 14:44.816
One thing we all know

14:44.851 --> 14:46.571
is that an agent
can never blow their cover.

14:46.603 --> 14:48.336
Yeah. About that.

14:52.942 --> 14:54.909
<i>Intel shows that an enemy spy</i>

14:54.944 --> 14:57.704
is expected to arrive
at any moment.

14:57.739 --> 14:59.867
Your mission is to place
a miniature GPS tracking device

14:59.891 --> 15:01.349
in his food.

15:01.384 --> 15:03.960
Once he eats it,

15:03.995 --> 15:05.114
we'll be able to
track him for up to 12 hours.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.828
Won't he know it's in his food?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.656
Honey, put it in the tempura.

15:08.691 --> 15:10.171
People eat anything
that's deep fried.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.928
<i>I have visual confirmation</i>

15:13.963 --> 15:15.723
that the targets
have entered the restaurant.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.944
Hi, Chef.

15:29.979 --> 15:31.887
What is Marisa doing there?

15:31.922 --> 15:33.605
Apparently disregarding

15:33.641 --> 15:35.983
the "please wait to
be seated" sign.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.111
Ah, Chef,
do you have a best friend?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.930
I have a best friend.
Well, I had a best friend.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.932
Normally, we come here together,

15:43.968 --> 15:44.942
but we had a really big fight.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.961
( Muttering gibberish )

15:46.996 --> 15:49.797
I know these things happen,

15:49.832 --> 15:51.908
but they don't happen
to me and KC.

15:51.943 --> 15:53.884
We used to tell each other
everything,

15:53.920 --> 15:55.236
but she's changed.

15:55.271 --> 15:57.872
( Gibberish )

15:57.907 --> 15:59.707
You're totally right.

15:59.742 --> 16:01.242
I'm being all judge-y judge-y,

16:01.277 --> 16:03.494
but it hurts.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.414
Oh, hey, could you do the big shrimp
flip and egg crack trick for me?

16:06.449 --> 16:08.007
( Gibberish )

16:08.043 --> 16:10.718
Carpal tunnel.

16:10.753 --> 16:12.520
Oh, please.
It would really cheer me up.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.879
( Sighs )

16:32.233 --> 16:34.041
The targets are leaving.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.304
You have to stop them,
even if it means

16:35.328 --> 16:36.328
breaking your cover.

16:56.065 --> 16:57.631
Hey, cool.
They added a floor show.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.111
KC?

17:20.940 --> 17:22.973
Now I get it.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.793
You've been acting all kooky

17:25.870 --> 17:28.278
because you're stressed out
from your secret job.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.173
Pretending to be
a male chef at Benimama's.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.502
Yeah. We need to talk.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.036
KC should be back by now.
I hope she's okay.

17:44.071 --> 17:45.516
Oh, please, we put her in
a lot more dangerous situations

17:45.540 --> 17:47.598
than last-minute
Christmas shopping.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.969
That's what I'm talking about. Maybe
we put too much pressure on her.

17:49.993 --> 17:51.761
Oh, stop. She can handle it.

17:51.796 --> 17:53.057
I'm sure she'll
be home any second.

17:53.081 --> 17:55.130
What are you doing?

17:55.165 --> 17:57.499
Oh, just making
myself comfortable.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.455
I got a feeling we are
gonna be here for a while.

18:04.425 --> 18:10.045
Maybe part of the problem
is that you resent your parents

18:10.080 --> 18:11.847
pushing you into being a spy.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.208
Are you kidding me?

18:14.243 --> 18:16.727
The missions I go on
with my parents are my favorite.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.939
Except sometimes,
I do have to pretend

18:17.963 --> 18:19.296
like I'm not having fun.

18:27.264 --> 18:29.306
We're at an expensive
French restaurant.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.124
What are you doing
on your phone?

18:31.160 --> 18:33.927
Ordering a pizza.

18:33.963 --> 18:35.688
Why do we bother
taking her to nice places?

18:35.723 --> 18:38.699
Here's an idea.

18:38.735 --> 18:40.011
How about I go the mall and you
guys pick me up when you're done?

18:40.035 --> 18:41.360
Or don't.

18:45.149 --> 18:48.125
Okay. Target has entered
the restaurant.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.768
I have facial
recognition confirmation.

18:49.803 --> 18:51.186
Target matches the profile.

18:51.221 --> 18:52.688
Slight limp, broad shoulders,

18:52.723 --> 18:56.108
weak chin,
and a very long eyelash?

18:56.143 --> 19:00.237
Oh, no, that one's mine
actually.

19:00.272 --> 19:03.365
Intel shows he's here
to get the stolen plans

19:03.400 --> 19:04.959
for a new missile
defense system.

19:04.994 --> 19:07.653
Our assignment:
Recover those plans.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.263
- I'll cover the exit.
- I'm going in.

19:13.677 --> 19:14.863
You can't go in the lounge.
It's for adults only.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.146
Not a problem.

19:27.049 --> 19:29.074
My little girl's
grown up so fast.

19:30.645 --> 19:33.996
KIRA: <i>He's on the move,
and he's got a briefcase.</i>

19:38.536 --> 19:40.086
I have a visual on the plans.

19:40.121 --> 19:41.170
Let's do this.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.564
Didn't anyone ever tell you
not to play with matches?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.102
I highly recommend
the filet of sole.

20:39.246 --> 20:40.396
I can't believe you hit me.

20:42.024 --> 20:43.357
I'm just a little girl.

20:49.356 --> 20:52.032
A little girl who just
girl-stomped you, son.

21:06.607 --> 21:09.258
Time for you to chill out.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.598
What? You never heard
of a teenage spy?

21:20.938 --> 21:23.380
KC, I'm not sure what to say.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.891
The work you do
is very important.

21:25.926 --> 21:27.095
You're not only helping people,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.720
you're actually saving lives.

21:29.755 --> 21:33.265
But at any age, there's a
tremendous amount of pressure,

21:33.300 --> 21:35.225
and it is clearly
getting to you.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.077
Maybe it's time
for you to get out.

21:37.113 --> 21:38.353
- Excuse me?
- Quit.

21:38.389 --> 21:40.606
Quit being a spy.

21:40.641 --> 21:43.884
I see what you're
doing here, doc.

21:43.961 --> 21:46.420
I see. You're trying
a little reverse psychology.

21:46.455 --> 21:48.330
Tell her to quit

21:48.366 --> 21:51.525
so that she'll quit
feeling her feelings.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.727
No, I really think
you're not cut out for this,

21:53.762 --> 21:55.779
and you should just walk away.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.132
Walk away?

21:58.167 --> 22:00.617
From the job that I love,

22:00.653 --> 22:03.253
doing it with
the family that I love?

22:03.288 --> 22:05.548
Yeah, no,
that's not gonna happen.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.816
Hey, you're the one with the issues.
You came to me.

22:07.851 --> 22:11.194
The only issue I have
is that it's the holidays, okay,

22:11.230 --> 22:13.080
and I'm feeling a little blue.

22:13.115 --> 22:16.366
It's called seasonal
holiday funkiness,

22:16.401 --> 22:19.694
or something
more professional-sounding.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.689
It's a real thing, okay,
and that is all that I have.

22:22.724 --> 22:24.249
Quit being a spy.
Give me a break.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.602
Hey, honey. How'd your
last-minute shopping go?

22:34.637 --> 22:37.354
Well, it turns out
all the gifts I need

22:37.389 --> 22:38.597
are actually right here.

22:38.632 --> 22:40.090
Oh!

22:40.125 --> 22:41.934
Wait. You mean us, right?

22:41.969 --> 22:43.802
Yes, you guys.

22:43.837 --> 22:45.870
That is so sweet.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.581
But FYI, I am still expecting

22:47.617 --> 22:49.357
that bottle of
Robaire Lattaire perfume.

22:49.393 --> 22:51.318
Guys, the tree
looks really good,

22:51.354 --> 22:52.144
but I'm seeing
a few empty spots.

22:52.179 --> 22:53.737
Let's get to work, people.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.523
CRAIG: Okay, the boss is here.

22:56.558 --> 23:03.004
ERNIE: Pass 'em on down.
