02:00.788 --> 02:03.957
- Well,
I've got a little bit of
not so great news

02:04.024 --> 02:05.493
from your cardiologist.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.161
Oh. We're trading phone calls.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.496
Did you speak to Dr. Levin?

02:08.562 --> 02:09.697
You're trading phone calls.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.830
Yeah, I know what it's about,
 though.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.533
It's my target weight.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.135
I'm-- I don't know.
 I'm a fat, fat fatty.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.705
I love, uh--
 I love pizza.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.440
- And--
 - I think you need to
 connect with her.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.609
Uh, is there something
 the matter?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.577
There's a couple of red flags
 on the echo test.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.613
- We just have--
 - Is there something wrong
 with my heart?

02:25.679 --> 02:28.382
Well, we have
 a couple of things
 going on in your heart

02:28.449 --> 02:30.218
that we want to
 keep an eye on,

02:30.284 --> 02:34.154
and I think Dr. Levin
will recommend going off
of the hormones,

02:34.222 --> 02:37.157
and keeping an eye on this
 for six months or so.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.426
Well, hold on.
 Is this a postponement?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.993
'Cause when I get out
 of surgery,

02:40.060 --> 02:41.262
I'm with this thing
 called Meal Train,

02:41.329 --> 02:42.563
and I already put out
 my emails,

02:42.630 --> 02:44.532
so how long
 are we talking?

02:44.598 --> 02:47.435
Well, look, I, um--
 I'm sorry to say this,

02:47.501 --> 02:50.504
but I don't think
this is a matter
of postponing something.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.540
I think--

02:52.606 --> 02:54.275
I think surgery's
 out of the question.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.979
Maura, I know this
 is disappointing.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.381
What about a waiver?

03:00.448 --> 03:02.550
Please do this.
 I will sign a waiver.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.619
All right?
 And that-- There'll be
 no malpractice. Okay?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.755
- Listen, listen to me,
 will you, please?
 - Please?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.257
- Just listen to me.
 - Please?

03:09.323 --> 03:12.159
Just because you
 can't have this surgery

03:12.226 --> 03:14.395
doesn't mean that
 you can't have a happy life.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.192
C, to the O,
 to the L-T-O-N.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.127
Hey, Josh.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.530
- You ain't gonna
 believe this, dog.
 - What's that?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.932
I am thinkin' about
 making an offer...

03:51.999 --> 03:54.268
on this bad boy.
Check it out.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.503
You feel me?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.771
Make an offer, like--

03:57.838 --> 04:00.674
- Like, buy a house?
 - Buy it, rent it, flip it.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.010
- Live in it.
 - You want to move here
 to Overland Park?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.678
Listen, I've been
 thinking about this.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.847
I don't want to do
 Red Pants anymore.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.384
I could liquidate my stock,
 spend a year writing songs.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.052
We could hang out.
 You and your friends,

04:12.119 --> 04:14.254
you could
come over to the house,
and literally just chill.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.290
- Yeah.
 - This Sunday, there's
 another open house.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.991
You want to come?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.027
Thanks,
 I-- I would love to,
 but I can't,

04:20.093 --> 04:21.595
'cause of the church.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.731
Copy. I read ya.
Okay, no worries.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.065
Aren't you coming with us?

04:25.132 --> 04:27.100
Uh, I w--
 I mean, well--

04:27.167 --> 04:29.303
Um, yeah,
I will be there.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.938
Just gotta squeeze
that house thing in, too.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.749
And then my goddess,
 slash game show host,
 slash dentist,

04:41.815 --> 04:44.718
touched my face,
 and everything was just
 weirdly okay.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.588
That's wacky
 all right.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.423
- That looks good.
 - What do you think?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.392
I don't know,
 are the pinstripes
 too much?

04:51.459 --> 04:53.627
No, I think
 it looks great.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.129
I don't know, I--
 Kinda reads like a--

04:56.196 --> 04:59.166
a sleazy banker to me.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.401
I don't want
 people to think

05:00.468 --> 05:03.337
that this award's
going to my head.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.605
I don't know,
 I kind of like

05:04.672 --> 05:05.506
a sleazy banker
 look on you.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.641
Oh, fuck you.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.677
You know what?
 I'm gonna try that
 tweed number again.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.279
You bring me that?

05:12.346 --> 05:16.350
So anyway,
I am trying to
figure out how to

05:16.417 --> 05:19.086
roll this all together
 into a thesis.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.422
What,
 your nitrous trip?

05:21.489 --> 05:24.257
No, b-- but the trip
 gave me an idea--

05:24.324 --> 05:26.093
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.895
Um, about how to
structure it.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.031
You know? Like--
Like in Hebrew Gematria.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.634
Taking multiples
of the number 18,
like 36,

05:33.701 --> 05:35.168
and using them
 as markers,

05:35.235 --> 05:37.471
and-- and creating
 this sort of...

05:37.538 --> 05:38.906
wheel imagery.

05:38.972 --> 05:42.209
You cannot write
a thesis about

05:42.275 --> 05:44.512
dentists and
 the number 36, Ali.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.647
No, it wouldn't be about
the number 36.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.650
It's basically like
 intersectionality

05:49.717 --> 05:51.385
as the holy other.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.586
Right?

05:52.653 --> 05:57.190
So, female, black, trans,

05:57.257 --> 06:00.894
just any-- any kind of other
 that the patriarchy

06:00.961 --> 06:03.196
would try to
 objectify or silence.

06:03.263 --> 06:07.000
And what if that otherness
 were the Messiah?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.438
You sound nuts.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.776
Oh, yeah.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.279
Oh, yeah,
this is the one.

06:19.346 --> 06:23.216
I just need to find a--
 a classy bolo or something.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.819
Did you figure out what
 you're gonna wear yet?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.655
No. no.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
Well,
 you better look cute.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.959
This is our official
 coming out.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.170
My God, it's Josh.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.139
Finally.
 Where are you?

06:46.206 --> 06:47.808
What?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.143
What?!

06:50.210 --> 06:51.679
Overland Park.
 Really?

06:53.914 --> 06:57.585
Hey, babe.
 Did you talk to the kids
 about coming on the cruise?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.186
I left messages
 for everybody.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.821
I told them it's
 an all expense paid

07:00.888 --> 07:02.590
floating paradise
of adventure.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.324
We needed to
know dates ASAP.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.959
Good.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.361
Ali texted and said
 she's a maybe.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.863
Well, keep n ooging
 the others.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.832
I'm trying, okay?

07:11.899 --> 07:14.167
Yeah. Why don't your kids
 ever return your phone calls?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.103
That's not true,
they do.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.472
Well, we gotta get some
 confirmed "Yes"s and "No"s

07:18.539 --> 07:20.874
so I can start cross checking
 with the black out dates.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.476
Ooh, look at you,
 you're such a producer.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.812
You're producing the cruise,
 you're producing my show,

07:24.878 --> 07:25.979
producing my orgasms.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.481
It's what I do.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.152
Did you ever hear back
 from Maura and Vic?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.354
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.756
They broke up.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.959
No. They seemed like
 such a perfect match.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.461
Yeah, well,
 I don't know what happened.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.464
I'm gonna run to the store.
 We're out of Diet Coke.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.034
- Do you need anything?
 - No. I'm good.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.136
Babe, could you
 spot me a ten?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.907
Um... sure.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.476
So you're going to
 Overland Park today?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.445
Yeah, or tomorrow.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.447
I don't know when I can get
 the flight I can afford.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.449
Can you do standby for cheap?
 Is that a thing?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.518
Hon, he is a big boy,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.353
and if he wants to
 splash around
 in some holy water,

08:06.419 --> 08:07.555
that's his prerogative.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.756
He's not splashing around
in holy water,

08:08.822 --> 08:10.190
he just
 disavowed the devil.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.424
Well, there's nothing wrong
 with that.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.893
Oh, my God.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.096
Except that Jesus is
 his personal something.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.899
- Personal pan pizza?
 - He's buying
 a fucking mansion

08:18.966 --> 08:21.168
in Overland Park.
 Clearly he needs me.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.671
- He's losing it.
- You know what
I think this is?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.206
I think this is you
 trying to break up with me,

08:26.273 --> 08:28.576
because you're afraid
 I might be on to you.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.943
It's not about you.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.881
Anyway, I love hearing about
 how fucked up I am from you.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.515
It makes me feel deeply,
 profoundly attracted to you.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.019
Oh, come on.
To criticize you
is to love you.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.621
To reflect you
 is to love you.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.756
Just sit in
 the discomfort.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.206
Hey, it's Pony,
 leave a message.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.909
Pony, it's-- it's Sarah.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.143
I'm out--
 I'm outside your place.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.578
We have an appointment.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.815
I-- I don't understand.
 Where-- Oh. Whoa.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.217
Who are you?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.652
Who are you?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.821
I'm, uh, Sarah,
Sarah Pfefferman.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.988
I have an appointment
 with Pony.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.556
Okay. Yeah,
 Pony told me about you.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.358
- She did?
 - Yeah, I think you're
 the reason why

09:18.425 --> 09:20.327
- she moved to Boulder.
 - She moved to Boulder?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.295
Yeah. Her brother runs
 this candle shop,

09:22.362 --> 09:24.064
so she wanted to be in
 the family business.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.634
The family business?
 Of candle shops?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.301
She didn't really
elaborate.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.571
Well, what am I
 supposed to do now?

09:31.639 --> 09:34.842
Um, she left
 all her gear behind,
 and I can totally--

09:34.908 --> 09:36.710
You know,
I don't have therapy for,
like, an hour, so--

09:36.777 --> 09:38.111
- What, you?
 - Yeah, sure.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.279
Just tell me
 what kind of slut you are,

09:39.346 --> 09:40.914
and I'll just flog
 the shit out of you.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.050
I also just learned how to use
 the suspension cuffs.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.418
No. No, no, no.
 It has to be a woman.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.055
Oh.
 Well, good luck with that.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.490
Pony is the only
 lady pro dom I know
 that works with chicks.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.126
- Okay, that cannot be true.
 - There's no money in it.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.495
I mean, it's really
not that hard for a woman

09:55.562 --> 09:58.065
to find someone to
 treat her like shit
 for free.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.818
Fuck!

10:59.292 --> 11:00.828
Jesus.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.904
Oh, my God.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.672
Oh, my God.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.778
Zachy! Ella!

11:17.845 --> 11:19.713
Get out here!

11:19.780 --> 11:21.882
- Get them out here now!
 - What are you yelling about?

11:21.949 --> 11:24.684
Just get them out here!
 Zachy and Ella!

11:24.752 --> 11:26.954
Whose is this?
 Do you see this skateboard?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.422
- Who left this here?
 - It's not mine.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.358
Okay, do you see
 what happened here?

11:31.424 --> 11:32.793
Can you see?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.962
You made an exit ramp
 for Nacho.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.463
Nacho is not here.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.831
- Calm down!
 - No!

11:37.898 --> 11:39.532
What would happen
if I was driving

11:39.599 --> 11:40.968
and I just left
 the door open while I drove?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.836
You would fall out,
 and you would be dead!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.772
Hey! Calm down!

11:44.838 --> 11:47.007
Now Nacho is nowhere
 to be found.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.909
- We'll find him.
 - He's probably at
 the neighbor's,

11:48.976 --> 11:50.643
or killed by a coyote.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.345
Stop it! Just stop it!

11:52.412 --> 11:55.482
I'm sorry!
 But that fucking turtle

11:55.548 --> 11:57.684
survived in a fucking wall

11:57.751 --> 11:59.419
for 30 fucking years!

11:59.486 --> 12:01.922
It took you three weeks
 to kill him!

12:03.623 --> 12:06.794
- Guys, he's not dead.
 - Three fucking weeks!

12:06.860 --> 12:07.928
Go inside.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.465
- What are you doing?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.434
Don't do that
 in front of them, okay?

12:14.501 --> 12:17.137
Not ever!
That's not cool!

12:18.939 --> 12:22.375
I don't want rage
in this house!

12:30.383 --> 12:33.453
- Have a good one.
 - Thank you.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.489
- Hey, what's up?
- So this is Kansas, huh?

12:36.556 --> 12:38.225
Yeah. Nice top.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.160
I'm sweating in weird places.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.562
Told you not to come,
 Stalker McStalkerson.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.297
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Let's go.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.498
Let me look at you.
 What's that?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.700
- What?
 - Oh, a little Christ blood?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.202
- Mmm.
 - Shut the fuck up.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.171
By the way, they take
that shit seriously, so--

12:51.238 --> 12:53.273
- Hey, Ali!
 - Hi!

12:53.340 --> 12:56.376
- How are you? How's it going?
 - So nice to see you.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
Thank you. You too. Yeah.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.280
Perfect timing.
 Pappy's throwing
 some meat on the grill.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.282
- Yes! Meat!
 - Come on back.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.286
- And this is--
- Arts and crafts, yeah.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.422
We use the Popsicle sticks
 to make the cross.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.492
- It's really pretty.
 - That's so cool.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.928
- Hey, guys, what's going on?
 - Shuckin'.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.763
Shuckin' and jivin'?

13:16.830 --> 13:19.766
Alexandra, I'm so glad
 you're here with us today.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.904
Oh, it's so nice.
 There's so much sky

13:23.971 --> 13:26.406
- and space everywhere.
 - Yeah.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.409
L.A. is a nightmare.
 I mean, you can't even
 breathe through all the smog.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.311
It's so nasty.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.047
Colton and I have going to
 this really cool park nearby.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.883
Doing some plyometrics.
 Trying to bulk him up.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.717
- He's still
 a little too skinny.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.519
Just tall.

13:39.586 --> 13:43.156
- Becky, sweetie, would
you get the deviled eggs?
- Yeah.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
People just, like, stop and
 just, like, wave you on by.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.929
- I mean, for real.
 - Well, we're very polite
 people around here, I guess.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.331
Sure seems that way.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.201
You know, Alexandra,
 your brother here has come
 to mean a great deal to us.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.270
He's got a much stronger
moral fiber than I gave
him credit for.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.342
Well, I-- I heard about
 the thing that he--

14:02.409 --> 14:03.843
he did at church.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.913
- That's--
 - Beautiful.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.415
No, that was all Colton.
He gave a great speech.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.183
- It was really moving.
 - It's a sermon.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.919
- Sermon.
 - Yeah, sermon.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.221
You got that lump
in your throat,
didn't you?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.856
You know what
 that was, Josh?

14:16.924 --> 14:19.826
- Uh...
- Josh, that was
the Holy Spirit.

14:19.893 --> 14:23.931
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean, oh, my, I felt
his presence myself.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.233
Oh, gosh, so did I.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.735
So did the whole
darn congregation.
Isn't that right, Colton?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.503
Yeah. Yeah.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.538
Wow.

14:35.008 --> 14:39.412
And then that fuckface says
 he wants me off hormones.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.882
I am not going through
 this thing without estrogen.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.754
I'm serious, really.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.856
I'm just so sick of that

14:49.923 --> 14:52.359
- whole bathroom mishigas--
 - Mm-hmm.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.427
...and that stuff
 at the grocery store.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.030
- Can I take your bags, ma'am?
 Sir? Sir?
 - Listen to me.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.466
You're a baby trans.
 You'll get used to it.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.268
- Aww, I'm a baby trans.
 - Really. Isn't that sweet?

15:01.334 --> 15:02.635
I just made that up.
 Do you like it?

15:02.702 --> 15:04.771
- Aww.
- Mm-hmm.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.373
Damn, girl.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.708
All right, well, now that
Vicky and I are through,

15:08.775 --> 15:12.245
this baby trans needs
 to get fucked up

15:12.312 --> 15:15.415
- and smoke 10,000 cigarettes.
 - I like it.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.617
- And I wanna go dancing
at the Oxwood.
- All right.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.752
- Okay.
 - I wanna go dancing,

15:19.819 --> 15:22.055
- and I wanna have some fun.
 - Okay.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.057
I'm gonna change,
 and I'm gonna wear
 something cunt!

15:24.124 --> 15:25.358
Cunt!

15:34.968 --> 15:37.604
You'd have done
 the same thing.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.808
No, I-- I would not convert
 to another religion

15:41.874 --> 15:44.544
because a bunch of people
 were staring at me on a stage.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.147
- It's not a bit.
 - I didn't say I converted.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.053
You're going around
 pretending to be a Christian.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.589
FYI...

15:56.656 --> 15:58.758
half this country
 is pretending to be
 Christian right now.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.460
What does it matter
 what I believe?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.362
I'm happy. Okay?

16:02.429 --> 16:06.033
I mean, also, I cannot
 let Colton down again.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.569
I need to be here for him.

16:14.274 --> 16:18.111
Shell, you gotta look at this.
 These dogs are crazy.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.881
I don't mean
 to be a nag, Buzzy,

16:21.948 --> 16:25.318
but if you have time
 to watch television,

16:25.385 --> 16:28.488
you have time to go to the ATM
 to get that ten you owe me.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.857
Honey-pie, you can't
get a ten out of an ATM.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.226
It's not the ten, Buzzy.

16:33.293 --> 16:37.330
It's the twenty
 from last week

16:37.397 --> 16:39.932
and the fifteen
 from the other day

16:39.999 --> 16:41.468
and the seven from whenever.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.040
First you tell me
you're broke,

16:47.107 --> 16:48.975
because you're in a lawsuit
 about a patent.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.777
That's true.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.048
- And then you say
 it's back taxes.
 - Also true.

16:55.115 --> 16:59.252
Well, I just don't know
 what to believe.

16:59.319 --> 17:03.056
Okay, okay.

17:03.123 --> 17:07.227
So, there is something
that I haven't told you,

17:07.294 --> 17:09.896
because it's kind of
 a sad story.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.266
You know how I said
 I'd never been married before?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.736
That I'd never met the one?
 Well, that wasn't true.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.771
I was married to a--

17:19.839 --> 17:22.709
to a sweet lady named Donna.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.612
And just before
 our 20th anniversary,

17:25.678 --> 17:27.780
she got the diagnosis.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.781
Cancer.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.383
Well--

17:30.450 --> 17:33.820
Why wouldn't you tell me
about a thing like that?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.923
I didn't want you
 to feel sorry for me.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.693
She was so brave with
 the chemo and the hair loss,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.863
and she was so concerned
about how she looked,

17:43.930 --> 17:46.166
but she was always
 beautiful to me.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.268
And I just wanted
the best for her,

17:48.335 --> 17:52.439
so we had the nurse at home
 and experimental medicine,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.707
and I had trouble
 keeping up with the bills.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.811
And then...

17:58.878 --> 18:01.814
four days after
 our 22nd anniversary,

18:01.881 --> 18:03.183
she died.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.790
Just before that,
she said to me

18:10.857 --> 18:13.160
that she wanted me
 to find someone else.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.597
I told her there was
 no way.

18:18.731 --> 18:22.935
I couldn't imagine
 that it was possible...

18:23.002 --> 18:24.837
until I met you.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.885
You didn't have a wife.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.894
You're right.
 I didn't.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.861
But, Shel--

18:55.134 --> 18:57.069
Shel. Shel, I--

18:57.136 --> 18:59.005
I know it wasn't
a whole truth

18:59.071 --> 19:00.607
in terms of actual fact,

19:00.673 --> 19:03.410
but I was just trying
 to explain to you that,

19:03.476 --> 19:05.412
if I had been married,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.280
I would have spent
 every last dollar I had

19:07.347 --> 19:09.382
for my dying wife

19:09.449 --> 19:10.850
because that's--
 that's what money is.

19:10.917 --> 19:11.618
We're done, Buzzy.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.724
I could accept you
 being broke.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.261
I could accept
 you being in debt to
 the U.S. government,

19:21.328 --> 19:24.797
but what I will not accept

19:24.864 --> 19:26.499
is being lied to.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.938
Never again.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.012
There was, actually,
 a Donna--

19:40.079 --> 19:42.749
You need to
 move out today.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.819
Wow. Really?
 What about the cruise?

19:46.886 --> 19:50.189
I'm fine.
 I'll have my family.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.391
Okay.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.283
Sorry about today.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.050
It was
 a little bit scary.

20:18.117 --> 20:21.321
I know. I scared myself.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.056
Do you want a backrub
 or something?

20:24.123 --> 20:26.726
- Really?
 - Is that a dumb question?

20:26.793 --> 20:31.197
Oh, my God, I want that
 more than anything
 in the whole world.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.665
Thank you.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.167
I so don't deserve it.
 Ohh.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.103
You so don't deserve it.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.971
My God,
 you're so good at that.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.809
I fucked everything up.
 I can't do anything right.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.712
Come on. You got a hundred
 non-observant Jews

20:45.778 --> 20:49.516
to sing
"Ya day day die die die."

20:49.582 --> 20:51.618
No, I didn't. Raquel did.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.254
And now Raquel's MIA.
 And Pony's gone.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.789
Oh, shit.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.057
- Yeah, I scared her away--
 - Really?

20:58.124 --> 21:00.393
...to do some candle
 business or something.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.530
Anyway, I don't have
anyone to do my "thang."

21:03.596 --> 21:05.064
I'm sure you can
 find somebody else.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.600
No, I guess there aren't
 that many people who do it.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.035
Well, I mean,
 how hard can it be?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.870
What does she do, just,
 like, boss you around

21:10.937 --> 21:13.373
and slap you a little?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.542
Sort of, yeah.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.978
With some hair pulling,
 you know.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.112
Like this?

21:20.179 --> 21:23.082
Aah. Oh, my God, ow.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.252
That actually hurt.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.355
That was pretty good.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.490
Aah.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.224
Is that how Pony does it?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.726
Uh-huh.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.995
She slapped your fucking
ass for you?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.764
Oh, my God.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.666
Yeah, and she pulls
 your fucking hair?

21:39.732 --> 21:40.633
Aah.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.901
Is that how she pulls it?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.436
Uh-huh.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.571
Yeah?

21:44.637 --> 21:45.572
Come here.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.075
I'm serious.
 Get over here.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.578
Come on.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.513
I don't have time
for this shit.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.550
Is this the kind of shit
that Pony does?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.320
Give me your hands.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.790
For real.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.858
Give me your little
 fucking slut hands.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.895
Is that what Pony does?

22:08.961 --> 22:11.431
Good and tight like that?

22:11.498 --> 22:13.433
Get your arms
 over your head.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.903
What she does to you?

22:18.304 --> 22:20.072
- Harder?
- Uh-huh.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.207
Uhh.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.375
Yeah?

22:22.442 --> 22:23.710
Is that what you want?

22:23.776 --> 22:25.778
- Huh?
 - Oh, my God.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.614
Yeah, I know you.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.348
I know what you want.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.484
I know you better than
 anybody in the whole world.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.260
Can-- I need to get--
 Can I get down?

22:41.327 --> 22:42.529
I c-- I can't.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.397
All right.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.533
I'm sorry.
 I mean, just, like--

22:46.599 --> 22:47.867
It's all right. I was--

22:47.934 --> 22:49.035
...because
 of the arrangement--

22:49.101 --> 22:50.202
- I get it.
 - ...everything. It--

22:50.269 --> 22:52.439
It's okay.
 I was just joking.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.775
I was joking around.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.310
No, I liked it.
 It was good. I just--

22:58.377 --> 23:00.913
I don't want to fuck
 everything up or anything.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.049
It's fine.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.574
I'm going to go
 get another drink.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.808
I'll be right back.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.260
You've got some moves
 on you.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.496
- Yeah, huh?
 - Right.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.197
Thank you.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.971
I'm Donald.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.373
I'm Maura.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.875
Hi, Maura.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.757
Josh.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.525
- Hey.
 - Hey.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.492
What's up?

24:53.560 --> 24:55.895
Um...

24:55.962 --> 24:58.230
Can I, uh, can I talk
 to you for a minute?

24:58.297 --> 24:59.398
Yeah.

24:59.465 --> 25:00.533
Uh, you want to sit?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.035
Yeah. Of course.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.170
Are you okay?

25:04.236 --> 25:07.506
Yeah. I was trying
to find the right moment

25:07.574 --> 25:09.441
to talk to you. I just--

25:09.508 --> 25:12.579
I didn't want to embarrass you
 in front of Mama and Pappy.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.749
I just-- just feel
 like this is a lot.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.317
Like I'm--
 Uh, am I a lot?

25:18.384 --> 25:20.887
Because I can
totally back off.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.188
It's, like, not
 a problem, you know.

25:22.254 --> 25:26.092
You never really asked me
if you could live here.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.828
I'm just trying to,
 you know...

25:30.863 --> 25:33.265
I'm your dad, right?

25:33.332 --> 25:35.134
Actually, you're not.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.172
No offense,

25:40.239 --> 25:41.741
but I already have a dad.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.546
Right. I just--
 Oh. Hey.

25:50.349 --> 25:53.119
It's okay. Go ahead.

25:53.185 --> 25:57.556
Look, I-- I don't think
 you're going to be happy here.

25:57.624 --> 26:01.227
And if I'm being completely
 honest with you, I--

26:01.293 --> 26:04.130
I don't think I'm going to be
 happy with you here, either.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.101
Oh.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.172
I don't want to hurt
 your feelings. I just--

26:13.239 --> 26:14.506
I'm really sorry.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.675
Don't be sorry.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.810
I r-- I get it.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.047
Uh, I got to go help with
 the dishes and everything.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.581
- Good man.
 - Yeah.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.435
I'm okay.

28:14.827 --> 28:18.097
Oh, Maura,
 you are so beautiful.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.699
I want to taste
 that big clit.
