WEBVTT

00:08.045 --> 00:10.045
On the top of a hillside,

00:10.161 --> 00:13.247
deep in the mountains
of Shuturmurg, India,

00:13.289 --> 00:16.082
sits a mystical retreat
long sought out

00:16.125 --> 00:18.210
- by those seeking answers...
- Is this real?

00:18.252 --> 00:19.796
to the questions
that define us.

00:19.836 --> 00:21.464
I mean, is any of this real?

00:21.506 --> 00:23.466
How do I know what's real?

00:23.508 --> 00:26.927
This is Lindsay Bluth-Fünke.

00:26.969 --> 00:28.887
You see me before you, yes?

00:28.929 --> 00:30.807
I am real to you.

00:30.848 --> 00:34.935
And this bag next to me,
it is as real as you or me.

00:34.977 --> 00:36.312
No, I know that one's real.

00:36.354 --> 00:37.896
I meant the other one--
the Louis Vuitton.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.856
I don't remember Vuitton
having two E's.

00:39.898 --> 00:41.693
The hillside was also known

00:41.734 --> 00:43.778
- for their bargains on designer handbags.
- Oh, no!

00:43.820 --> 00:45.488
That's how they do it here.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.740
You can't go wrong.
Best bag on the mountain.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.992
I love this bag.
I give you 60 for it.

00:50.034 --> 00:51.661
- It's the best bag on the mountain.
- Excuse me.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.705
- I just promised it to her.
- I'll give you $70.

00:53.746 --> 00:55.956
Lindsay Bluth had come
to India for both reasons.

00:55.998 --> 00:58.376
- Uh, $120. - You just bought
the best bag on the mountain.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.712
- Congratulations.
- Best bag on the mountain.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.090
Now the story of a family

01:05.132 --> 01:07.593
whose future
was abruptly canceled

01:07.635 --> 01:09.887
and the one daughter
who had no choice

01:09.928 --> 01:12.097
but to keep her life together.

01:16.352 --> 01:18.312
It's Lindsay's...

01:20.815 --> 01:22.483
- I love it.
- Lindsay was on

01:22.525 --> 01:24.151
a spiritual journey to let go

01:24.193 --> 01:26.779
of all possessions
and to find something cute

01:26.821 --> 01:28.406
- to keep her stuff in.
- It's gorgeous.

01:28.447 --> 01:31.075
Months earlier,
Lindsay had lost her bearings

01:31.116 --> 01:33.578
after finding out
she wasn't born

01:33.619 --> 01:35.454
to the family
she couldn't bear.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.623
- I'm adopted?
- So, after getting

01:37.665 --> 01:39.584
briefly creepy
with her brother...

01:39.625 --> 01:41.669
I'm just not that into
older women.

01:41.711 --> 01:43.170
- Don't worry about it.
- You bastard!

01:43.212 --> 01:44.547
She shared some resentments

01:44.589 --> 01:46.424
with her family
at the boat party.

01:46.465 --> 01:48.342
Kitty likes to scratch...

01:48.384 --> 01:50.052
But before she could
disassociate herself

01:50.094 --> 01:52.137
- from the Bluth name...
- Because now I know that

01:52.179 --> 01:53.514
we're not related.
Anyway, Michael...

01:53.556 --> 01:54.891
Oh, my God. The SEC.

01:54.932 --> 01:57.351
...the Bluth name
would become...

01:57.393 --> 01:59.812
...as sullied as Newport Bay
on the fifth of May.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.731
They are persecuting me.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.734
It was an accident.
This is ridiculous!

02:04.776 --> 02:07.570
If I'd told them we were taking
a bunch of gays out there

02:07.612 --> 02:09.530
to get married,
they'd have thrown me a parade.

02:09.572 --> 02:13.242
Let's tell them we were taking
a bunch of gays to get married.

02:13.284 --> 02:15.035
Yeah, I don't think your record
on that issue

02:15.077 --> 02:16.287
is going to back that up, Mom.

02:16.328 --> 02:17.747
In fact, it was an issue

02:17.789 --> 02:19.415
of theBay Windowmagazine

02:19.457 --> 02:21.375
that would most damage her
with the gay community.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.628
Fine. We'll say
they took it on a joyride.

02:23.669 --> 02:25.755
And you have no right
to criticize me.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.299
At least I was able
to turn myQueenaround.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.634
None taken.

02:29.675 --> 02:31.469
This is Tobias Fünke,

02:31.510 --> 02:33.178
who should have taken more.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.806
- Oh.
- You cannot say

02:34.847 --> 02:37.475
one nice thing
to your daughter, can you?

02:37.516 --> 02:38.684
Adopted daughter.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.853
And that's not true.

02:40.895 --> 02:43.606
Could I have the Bluth
family over here, please?

02:43.648 --> 02:46.108
And over here, the victims
of the Bluth family?

02:46.150 --> 02:48.402
And that's when Lindsay

02:48.444 --> 02:51.071
found a label more fitting
than "Bluth."

02:51.113 --> 02:53.365
No, Lindsay, you're going
to the wrong area.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.034
Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike,
Bix and Gator are over here.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.871
We should be over here
at the Bluth area with Gob

02:58.913 --> 03:01.833
and Buster and, uh... uh...

03:01.874 --> 03:04.418
uh, your brother, uh...

03:04.460 --> 03:06.378
- Michael?
- Michael. Yes.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.256
Sorry. I was thinking
of Mike, the hot seaman.

03:09.298 --> 03:11.509
- No, where is Michael?
- It doesn't matter.

03:11.550 --> 03:12.760
He's not my brother.

03:12.802 --> 03:14.136
This isn't my family.

03:14.178 --> 03:16.514
No, I've spent years...

03:16.555 --> 03:18.850
Yes! Got my yes.
I got that big yes.

03:18.891 --> 03:22.102
I've spent years trying
to fit into this family,

03:22.144 --> 03:23.479
and it's not me.

03:23.521 --> 03:25.857
My life is a fallacy.

03:25.898 --> 03:27.483
Oh...

03:27.525 --> 03:29.151
♪ Is that a gal I see? ♪

03:29.193 --> 03:32.822
♪ No, it's just
a phallus... eee! ♪

03:32.864 --> 03:35.324
We loved that.
Where's that from?

03:35.366 --> 03:36.993
It's from nothing.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.244
But it made her
realize this, too.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.080
I don't know if there's
a right time to say this,

03:42.122 --> 03:45.459
but this marriage of ours,
it hasn't been working.

03:45.501 --> 03:49.714
Yeah... there's nothing
keeping us together.

03:51.173 --> 03:54.927
I... I believe we're thinking
the same thing.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.304
- Yeah, we should end it.
- Let's give it another shot.

03:57.346 --> 03:59.139
To the head. Kill it.

03:59.181 --> 04:00.683
Yes.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.438
Lindsay was looking
for inspiration

04:06.480 --> 04:09.984
before she set out
on her new path.

04:10.026 --> 04:12.194
And it only took
until the "Pray" section

04:12.236 --> 04:15.573
of Eat, Pray, Love
for her to find it.

04:15.614 --> 04:17.281
Hmm.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.786
Soon, she was beginning
a journey to reinvent herself.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.496
Ugh. I'm doing it again.

04:22.538 --> 04:25.457
I have to let go
of these material things.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.919
To leave the trappings
of her old life

04:27.960 --> 04:30.588
and try to live with less.

04:30.629 --> 04:32.381
There.

04:32.423 --> 04:34.383
Her immersion
into Indian culture began

04:34.425 --> 04:36.176
even before reaching
the airport.

04:36.218 --> 04:37.845
And, uh...
and so this daily prayer,

04:37.887 --> 04:39.129
it connects one to the whole.

04:39.258 --> 04:41.301
- anus tart.
- God.

04:41.343 --> 04:43.636
You know,
you sense the oneness in all.

04:43.678 --> 04:46.765
And they have
normal toilets, right?

04:46.806 --> 04:48.433
And after an hour or so

04:48.474 --> 04:50.560
withSkyMall,where she was

04:50.602 --> 04:53.397
proud of herself
for only buying two things--

04:53.438 --> 04:56.691
a self-cleaning litter box
in case she ever got a cat

04:56.733 --> 05:01.280
and an inflatable hat box
in case she ever got a hat--

05:01.321 --> 05:03.990
she got to a great article
in the in-flight magazine

05:04.032 --> 05:06.076
and found herself filling up

05:06.118 --> 05:08.203
with inner peace
and acceptance.

05:08.245 --> 05:10.455
I mean, not right away.

05:10.496 --> 05:11.998
What is she doing back there?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.959
That passenger had been

05:14.000 --> 05:16.378
pushing on her seat
for like four hours.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.881
Lindsay's journey
to let go of her baggage

05:19.923 --> 05:22.675
got off to a bad start
at baggage claim

05:22.717 --> 05:25.553
when she picked up
the wrong baggage.

05:25.595 --> 05:27.847
And her Western notions
of the value of life

05:27.889 --> 05:30.183
were challenged on the bus ride
to the hotel.

05:31.393 --> 05:32.560
Oh, my God.

05:32.602 --> 05:35.063
Did... did we just
hit something?

05:35.105 --> 05:36.648
Shouldn't we stop?

05:36.689 --> 05:38.650
No. It wasn't a cow.

05:38.691 --> 05:41.611
It was just a tourist.

05:41.653 --> 05:43.613
And that's howLindsay's path

05:43.655 --> 05:46.032
- to living with less...
- Wait. This isn't my...

05:46.074 --> 05:48.201
How am I supposed to find out

05:48.243 --> 05:50.078
who I really am
dressed like this chick?

05:50.120 --> 05:53.457
...took a brief detour into
a shopping spree at India's

05:53.497 --> 05:55.541
- famous Mall Mountain.
- It's cute on me.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.961
But I thought it was
supposed to say "Kate."

05:58.003 --> 06:00.797
Oh, no, anything under a small
is considered

06:00.839 --> 06:02.382
a "David Spade."

06:02.424 --> 06:04.384
I love this jacket.
I'll give you 60 for it.

06:04.426 --> 06:05.551
Best coat on the mountain.

06:05.593 --> 06:07.762
- 65.
- 70! It'd look great

06:07.804 --> 06:09.473
on my wife or my sickly son.

06:09.513 --> 06:11.391
- 100 bucks. Yes!
- $100, yes.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.809
And soon, she was back

06:12.851 --> 06:14.227
at the hotel and ready

06:14.269 --> 06:16.480
for her spiritual experience.

06:19.232 --> 06:20.524
Yeah, hi.

06:20.566 --> 06:22.444
Uh, were you able
to book my 3:00 shaman?

06:22.486 --> 06:24.237
Oh, yes.
Did you want the deep wisdom

06:24.279 --> 06:25.529
or just a light ego cleanse?

06:25.571 --> 06:26.865
We do those by the pool.

06:26.906 --> 06:28.741
- There's a pool?
- It's hard to tell

06:28.783 --> 06:30.494
because there are
so many people in it,

06:30.534 --> 06:32.620
but yes, it is a pool.

06:32.662 --> 06:34.039
Well, yeah, by the pool, then.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.208
And, uh, do you think
you can get someone

06:36.249 --> 06:39.127
to remove the smell of lamb
from my room?

06:39.169 --> 06:41.380
Of course. And which
animal smell would you prefer?

06:41.421 --> 06:42.922
Which do you prefer?

06:42.964 --> 06:45.342
But at her 3:00 p.m. shaman...

06:45.384 --> 06:47.927
You are living a life
without love.

06:47.969 --> 06:49.929
- Lindsay got a deeper treatment
- How do I learn to...

06:49.971 --> 06:51.515
- than she had hoped for.
- be happy?

06:51.555 --> 06:53.099
You know, to love?

06:53.141 --> 06:56.395
When love is near your heart,
you'll be happy.

06:56.436 --> 06:59.481
You must live life truthfully.

06:59.523 --> 07:02.692
Yeah, no, I-I-I do live
truthfully,

07:02.734 --> 07:04.361
but, uh...

07:04.403 --> 07:06.905
I'm just so full of passion.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.990
You are so full of.

07:09.032 --> 07:10.367
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.409 --> 07:12.577
Although, in my culture,
"full of"

07:12.618 --> 07:13.953
is kind of like a dig.

07:13.995 --> 07:16.081
I mean, you'd never say it
to a customer.

07:16.122 --> 07:18.250
But, uh, yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

07:18.291 --> 07:21.169
This bag is as fake as you are.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.380
Well, how do I learn?

07:23.422 --> 07:24.797
Just look at the spelling.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.258
God. No, I...

07:26.299 --> 07:28.343
Pull your head out of the sand.

07:28.385 --> 07:30.720
Love is where you left it.

07:30.762 --> 07:33.181
You mean... back home?

07:33.223 --> 07:34.433
God.

07:34.474 --> 07:36.435
The only person back home
is Tobias.

07:36.476 --> 07:38.686
You have no children?

07:38.728 --> 07:41.064
Lindsay thought
she was being hit on.

07:41.106 --> 07:43.525
No. Why do you ask?

07:43.567 --> 07:46.069
Wait a minute.
You're saying I've come

07:46.111 --> 07:47.987
halfway around the world
to find out

07:48.029 --> 07:49.406
I need to go back home?

07:49.448 --> 07:51.950
God, I haven't even gone
to the beach yet.

07:51.991 --> 07:55.954
She had. It was just
too crowded to see the water.

07:55.995 --> 07:58.706
It was a moving experience,

07:58.748 --> 08:00.875
but after leaving the tent,
it wasn't just

08:00.917 --> 08:03.253
the shaman's words
that got through to her.

08:03.295 --> 08:04.588
It was this.

08:04.629 --> 08:06.590
I'm sorry.
Your AmEx was declined.

08:06.631 --> 08:07.924
Your account is maxed out.

08:07.966 --> 08:09.801
We had to cancel
your shaman appointment.

08:09.842 --> 08:11.719
No, no, I just talked
to the shaman,

08:11.761 --> 08:13.472
just right back at...

08:15.181 --> 08:16.808
Get out! Get out!

08:16.849 --> 08:19.394
Go away! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

08:19.436 --> 08:23.940
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

08:23.982 --> 08:26.401
So get out.

08:26.443 --> 08:28.361
But, fortunately, the universe

08:28.403 --> 08:30.447
offered a solution
to her financial problem

08:30.489 --> 08:33.698
that wasn't too far off
from what her shaman had said.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.868
Oh, I've
got money for you, sweetie,

08:35.909 --> 08:38.496
but it means my loving daughter
smiling next to her husband

08:38.538 --> 08:39.998
sitting behind me at the trial.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.582
Would you take a grimace?

08:43.042 --> 08:45.044
So it was with
this dual intention

08:45.086 --> 08:48.965
that she reached out
to a husband she'd left behind,

08:49.007 --> 08:51.426
with a new sense
of inner peace.

08:51.468 --> 08:53.178
Of course, there was still
some outer stuff

08:53.219 --> 08:54.429
she needed to work through.

08:54.471 --> 08:55.763
Hello. It's Tobias.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.015
Leave a message.

08:57.056 --> 08:58.600
I'm ready to make this work.

09:01.394 --> 09:03.855
It was with a sense
of enlightenmentthat Lindsay

09:03.896 --> 09:05.815
returned from her
spiritual journey...

09:05.857 --> 09:08.109
...to get her hands on
the stimulus money, too, right?

09:08.151 --> 09:09.653
Stop with the prayer hands.

09:09.694 --> 09:11.321
It just looks
like you're out of ideas.

09:11.363 --> 09:13.615
Seriously, shoot me
if you ever catch me doing that.

09:13.657 --> 09:15.325
Says the least spiritual
man I know.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.452
What deal
did you strike with her?

09:17.494 --> 09:19.871
What part of her soul
did you buy?

09:19.912 --> 09:21.540
All I've asked
is that she testify

09:21.581 --> 09:24.417
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

09:24.459 --> 09:25.793
So all of it.

09:25.835 --> 09:27.962
No, Michael.
I'm not a whore.

09:28.004 --> 09:29.381
I don't get any of the money

09:29.422 --> 09:30.840
until after I do
the disgusting thing.

09:30.882 --> 09:33.009
But I'm not here
just for the stimmy.

09:33.051 --> 09:34.678
I'm here
because a shaman told me

09:34.719 --> 09:36.888
that love is where I left it.

09:36.929 --> 09:38.598
Which, after much soul searching

09:38.640 --> 09:42.477
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.688
I got the part.

09:45.938 --> 09:47.566
And so Lindsay and Tobias

09:47.607 --> 09:50.235
took another shot
at being husband and wife,

09:50.276 --> 09:52.070
and although they wouldn't
have money

09:52.111 --> 09:54.573
until after the perjury,
they set about

09:54.614 --> 09:56.658
- buying a home.
- Are you ready to make a move?

09:56.700 --> 10:00.662
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

10:00.704 --> 10:02.830
Oh! Good heavens!

10:02.872 --> 10:03.998
Right!

10:04.040 --> 10:05.458
Well, this is a great area.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.168
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

10:07.210 --> 10:09.337
We're doing it.
We're really doing this.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.381
Yes! We're gonna get you
in the right house.

10:11.423 --> 10:13.550
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

10:13.592 --> 10:15.760
We don't.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.304
We should be honest here.

10:18.346 --> 10:19.598
We have no income flow.

10:19.639 --> 10:20.890
No incoming income flow.

10:20.932 --> 10:22.392
We have plenty
of outgoing income.

10:22.434 --> 10:24.102
No savings, no credit.

10:24.143 --> 10:25.395
I mean, we had some stimmy,

10:25.437 --> 10:27.813
but that went
to his hospital bills.

10:27.855 --> 10:30.191
But there's one thing
we do have--

10:30.233 --> 10:31.192
Work ethic!

10:31.234 --> 10:32.444
Right. No work ethic.

10:32.485 --> 10:33.778
But there's one thing
we do have--

10:33.819 --> 10:35.572
we do have a daughter.

10:35.614 --> 10:38.408
I was just on auto-pilot
before, when I said we didn't.

10:38.450 --> 10:39.825
I should have caught that;
yeah, but...

10:39.867 --> 10:41.411
I could've spoken up,

10:41.453 --> 10:43.538
but I just wanted to see
if you guys got there.

10:43.580 --> 10:45.164
Well, you guys seem like
a great family.

10:45.206 --> 10:46.874
We have to be realistic.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.293
I'm in the real estate business.

10:48.334 --> 10:50.044
It's 2006.

10:50.086 --> 10:52.130
That's all good enough for me.

10:52.171 --> 10:53.673
We're gonna put you
in a NINJA loan.

10:53.715 --> 10:55.717
"No income, no jobs,
no assets."

10:55.759 --> 10:57.594
And you don't have to pay
a penny for two years.

10:57.636 --> 10:59.053
Oh, NINJA! Please!

10:59.095 --> 11:00.888
So we'll take something
cozy and intimate.

11:00.930 --> 11:03.349
- A one-bedroom.
- Or bigger.

11:03.391 --> 11:04.601
Yeah, how about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

11:04.643 --> 11:05.685
Three does sound bigger.

11:05.727 --> 11:07.437
Oh, it definitely is.

11:07.479 --> 11:09.397
You have to remember
that this was a time

11:09.439 --> 11:11.566
when banks were eager to create
as much debt as possible.

11:11.608 --> 11:13.359
...the five-bedroom,
four-car garage.

11:13.401 --> 11:15.945
And I know that you guys
are going to be okay

11:15.987 --> 11:17.489
with just one master bathroom,

11:17.530 --> 11:20.158
because a lot of people
do prefer two.

11:20.199 --> 11:21.909
You know, they like
to just have it.

11:21.951 --> 11:23.869
Maybe separate, so we have it.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.413
So we have it.
That way we have it.

11:25.455 --> 11:26.581
That way you have it.

11:26.623 --> 11:27.957
Do you think
we really need one?

11:27.999 --> 11:29.417
I'm just gonna
interrupt for a second.

11:29.459 --> 11:31.210
You don't need a wine cellar,

11:31.252 --> 11:33.797
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

11:33.837 --> 11:35.923
I mean, this really isn't
what we discussed.

11:35.965 --> 11:38.802
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but, uh...

11:38.842 --> 11:41.179
yes, uh, I guess, that way,
we... we have it.

11:41.220 --> 11:42.430
Well... yeah...

11:42.472 --> 11:44.557
That way,
you'll definitely have it.

11:44.599 --> 11:47.435
And then once you have it,
that way, you'll have it.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.771
But do we need a gatehouse?

11:49.813 --> 11:53.024
I just put John Beard into a
house with a double gatehouse.

11:53.065 --> 11:55.485
Now, that's John Beard;
he's on television.

11:55.527 --> 11:56.944
No one's gonna look down on you

11:56.986 --> 11:58.904
just 'cause you have less
than John Beard.

11:58.946 --> 12:00.657
- Is this crazy?
- I think so.

12:00.699 --> 12:02.158
We'll take
the double gatehouse.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.867
Oh, is that what you thought?
Because...

12:03.909 --> 12:05.495
- Well, that way, we'll have it.
- We have it. We have it.

12:05.537 --> 12:07.079
And that way, you have it.

12:07.121 --> 12:08.164
There was a lot of this
going on back then.

12:08.206 --> 12:10.249
This way, we have it.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.001
And soon, they were
starting their new life

12:12.043 --> 12:14.920
- Good point!
- in their new, beautiful home.

12:14.962 --> 12:16.673
Mother's Day Eve

12:16.715 --> 12:18.924
was the most joyous day
of the year.

12:18.966 --> 12:21.093
Maeby, you're gonna
be late for school.

12:21.135 --> 12:23.137
And what they lost
in coziness...

12:23.179 --> 12:24.848
God, they grow up so slowly.

12:24.888 --> 12:27.891
...they made up for in
cavernous, unfurnished space.

12:27.933 --> 12:31.145
- And the robot's dead again.
- Oh! Poor little guy.

12:31.187 --> 12:35.191
Ran out of juice before
he could reach his...

12:36.693 --> 12:38.444
With her mother's
trial coming up,

12:38.486 --> 12:41.865
Lindsay made an effort
to work on her testimony.

12:41.905 --> 12:43.199
...when I was hungry, I...

12:43.241 --> 12:45.410
Go on.

12:45.451 --> 12:47.953
You don't want me to say
this next part, do you?

12:47.995 --> 12:49.581
I think it tells the story.

12:49.622 --> 12:52.751
But am I
accidentally being funny,

12:52.792 --> 12:55.169
or am I purposely being funny?

12:55.211 --> 12:56.629
It's not supposed to be funny.

12:56.671 --> 12:59.298
"Suckled at her champagne
glass breasts"?

12:59.340 --> 13:00.383
Is it a joke?

13:00.425 --> 13:01.593
Buster wrote it.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.052
Recently?

13:03.094 --> 13:05.304
I adapted it from a letter
he wrote from camp.

13:05.346 --> 13:06.806
I miss you, Mommy.

13:06.848 --> 13:08.266
Camp is scary at times.

13:08.307 --> 13:09.975
When I was cold, you clothed me,

13:10.017 --> 13:11.477
when I was hungry...

13:11.519 --> 13:13.937
Uh, how do I say this?

13:13.979 --> 13:17.483
Suckled at your champagne
glass breasts.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.068
Oh, that's good.

13:19.110 --> 13:20.612
It doesn't matter.
I'll be proofing it, anyway.

13:20.653 --> 13:21.863
Oh, God.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.407
This is from
Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?

13:24.449 --> 13:26.701
Just read the copy.
You're getting paid for this.

13:26.743 --> 13:27.786
No. You know what?

13:27.827 --> 13:28.994
The money is not
important to me.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.413
My shaman said...

13:30.455 --> 13:33.625
Oh, don't give me that
mystical nonsense.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.710
You think you're
better than I am.

13:35.752 --> 13:38.296
But you're a lot more like me
than you think you are.

13:38.337 --> 13:40.757
Now, let's take it from:

13:40.799 --> 13:43.718
"I hope she gives me
bubble baths forever."

13:43.760 --> 13:45.720
And I want to smell the suds.

13:45.762 --> 13:48.013
But worse news was
around the corner.

13:48.055 --> 13:50.266
The collapse of the
California housing market

13:50.308 --> 13:51.810
is taking a personal toll...

13:51.851 --> 13:53.812
- Uh-oh.
- ...with layoffs here at the station.

13:53.853 --> 13:55.855
In addition,
I'm leaving the keys

13:55.897 --> 13:57.941
to my 10,000-square-foot home
in Harbor Shallows

13:57.981 --> 14:00.109
- here on the desk...
- Well, it probably

14:00.151 --> 14:01.444
shouldn't affect our area.

14:01.486 --> 14:02.779
He's over by
where the fountain is.

14:02.821 --> 14:03.905
Might I say to them

14:03.947 --> 14:05.657
good luck getting that

14:05.698 --> 14:07.617
raccoon smell
out of the gatehouse,

14:07.659 --> 14:10.161
because I never could.

14:10.202 --> 14:12.163
But you and I are okay, right?

14:12.204 --> 14:14.165
I mean, this works, right?

14:14.206 --> 14:15.792
Never better.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.839
And the week
of Lucille's trial,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.715
they got some even worse news.

14:22.757 --> 14:25.551
What's this?
Mother's not going to pay?

14:25.593 --> 14:27.470
She actually said
she'd only pay me

14:27.512 --> 14:29.054
if my testimony is believable.

14:29.096 --> 14:30.556
Lindsay! Lindsay!

14:30.598 --> 14:32.099
...but how am I supposed
to say something like

14:32.141 --> 14:33.100
"I love you, Mother!"

14:33.142 --> 14:35.269
and sound believable?

14:35.311 --> 14:37.605
Well, geez... Jesus C. Penny!

14:37.647 --> 14:39.482
You know,
I wish I had the luxury

14:39.524 --> 14:41.359
of not sounding believable.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.028
But that's not an option for
an out-of-work actor, is it?

14:44.069 --> 14:46.197
Or it's why you're out of work!

14:46.238 --> 14:49.784
Well, I beg one's pardon,
but I have been dying to go

14:49.826 --> 14:52.704
to that Method Acting Clinic
that I see on my nightly drives,

14:52.745 --> 14:54.246
but you won't let me!

14:54.288 --> 14:56.415
Because you already
wasted all that money

14:56.457 --> 14:58.793
on Carl Weathers'
Master Acting Class.

14:58.835 --> 15:01.921
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a star

15:01.963 --> 15:04.883
that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said!

15:04.924 --> 15:08.219
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your Method Acting Class,

15:08.260 --> 15:10.304
to make my testimony
more believable!

15:10.346 --> 15:11.681
That's actually a good idea.

15:11.723 --> 15:14.141
Maybe you could--
Oh! Hi. Yes.

15:14.183 --> 15:16.602
Well, perhaps we should
go together.

15:16.644 --> 15:19.981
Yeah. Might be good
for us, as a couple.

15:20.023 --> 15:21.816
I do hope so.

15:21.858 --> 15:24.109
I really want
to make this work.

15:24.151 --> 15:25.862
Me, too.

15:25.904 --> 15:28.155
I really love you, Tobias.

15:28.197 --> 15:29.866
Oh, Lindsay, we have

15:29.908 --> 15:32.618
got to get you to
that acting clinic.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.371
And that was with me
picturing fudge.

15:35.413 --> 15:36.956
Fudge.

15:41.293 --> 15:43.087
To bond with her husband

15:43.128 --> 15:45.423
and prepare for her testimony,

15:45.464 --> 15:48.300
Lindsay had decided to attend
an acting class with Tobias.

15:48.342 --> 15:49.886
This is the first time

15:49.928 --> 15:51.387
I've actually done something
like this with you.

15:51.429 --> 15:53.264
I think I always
kind of looked down on it.

15:53.305 --> 15:55.182
You know, Lindsay, I think
you'll find that

15:55.224 --> 15:57.602
some of what used to seem
clueless about me

15:57.643 --> 16:00.312
is actually something
I'm quite good at.

16:00.354 --> 16:03.190
This... is where I belong.

16:03.232 --> 16:05.068
If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

16:05.109 --> 16:06.694
Uh, fill out this form first.

16:06.736 --> 16:08.947
And there's some personal
questions on it, like, uh,

16:08.988 --> 16:10.197
how you first got hooked.

16:10.239 --> 16:11.574
Well, that's an easy one:

16:11.616 --> 16:12.825
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

16:14.368 --> 16:15.578
No, uh, no,Mame.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.829
No, ma'am...?

16:16.871 --> 16:18.247
You're A Good Man...

16:18.289 --> 16:19.707
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

16:19.749 --> 16:20.959
Gypsy. Gypsy.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.251
Just come up here and be

16:22.293 --> 16:24.045
as truthful as possible.

16:24.087 --> 16:26.965
Okay, this is
overwhelming.

16:27.006 --> 16:28.382
They're starting the monologues.

16:28.424 --> 16:30.927
I think this is from
Songs for My Father.

16:30.969 --> 16:32.219
This  is
 up, right?

16:32.261 --> 16:33.554
What did you say

16:33.596 --> 16:34.639
the name of this acting class
was again?

16:34.680 --> 16:35.807
Method One Clinic.

16:35.848 --> 16:37.850
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

16:37.892 --> 16:40.436
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

16:40.478 --> 16:42.772
And moments later,
as Lindsay, once again,

16:42.814 --> 16:46.358
found herself questioning
her husband's choices,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.443
one of hers was questioned.

16:47.485 --> 16:48.903
Ugh! That's not Free Trade,

16:48.945 --> 16:50.655
and if it's not Free Trade,
it's.

16:50.696 --> 16:52.364
I wouldn't...

16:52.406 --> 16:54.075
You don't look like a junkie.

16:54.117 --> 16:55.910
You do. What do you weigh,
like, 90 pounds?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.121
That's so funny!

16:58.162 --> 16:59.664
God, um... thank you.

16:59.705 --> 17:01.206
But-but no, no.

17:01.248 --> 17:03.042
If I'm addicted to anything,
it's alcohol.

17:03.084 --> 17:04.376
I'm Lindsay.

17:04.417 --> 17:07.421
And you're... hmm!
"Bitéme."

17:07.463 --> 17:10.008
No, I don't like giving my name
to any state organization,

17:10.049 --> 17:11.968
especially after I got kicked
off the voter rolls,

17:12.010 --> 17:14.470
'cause I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.513
Wow.
What group was that?

17:16.555 --> 17:18.808
You know, I don't even remember.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.768
Just some guy in a booth
on the boardwalk.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.394
He joined Al Qaeda.

17:22.435 --> 17:23.561
And I only signed up
'cause he was giving away

17:23.604 --> 17:25.064
a free beard brush.

17:25.106 --> 17:27.150
...that says "Al Qaeda" on it.

17:27.191 --> 17:30.028
But maybe he thought it was
the designer of the brush.

17:30.069 --> 17:31.403
I'm Marky Bark.

17:31.445 --> 17:33.238
Of the tree-freer Barks?

17:33.280 --> 17:35.366
Marky was the son
of Johnny Bark,

17:35.407 --> 17:38.243
an activist that Lindsay
had once helped save,

17:38.285 --> 17:40.412
and then kill, a tree.

17:40.454 --> 17:41.664
Oh, my God!
I remember him!

17:41.706 --> 17:42.915
I remember thinking, one day,

17:42.957 --> 17:44.542
he was just gonna
fall out of a tree

17:44.583 --> 17:45.543
and break his neck.

17:45.584 --> 17:47.003
Whatever happened to him?

17:47.045 --> 17:48.212
He fell out of a tree
and broke his neck.

17:48.253 --> 17:49.296
Oh, God...

17:49.338 --> 17:50.381
No, I'm just kidding.

17:50.422 --> 17:52.175
Oh...

17:52.216 --> 17:53.258
So how is he?

17:53.300 --> 17:54.301
Oh, he's dead.

17:54.343 --> 17:56.261
But natural causes.

17:56.303 --> 17:57.847
A bunch of deranged bees
chased him out of a tree

17:57.889 --> 17:59.015
and he fell to his death.

17:59.057 --> 18:00.349
So, are you here alone, or...?

18:00.391 --> 18:01.559
No, I'm with her.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.311
She's a committee member.

18:04.353 --> 18:06.147
Which committee is that?

18:06.189 --> 18:07.648
Itty-bitty.

18:07.690 --> 18:10.234
What a wonderful sense of humor.

18:10.275 --> 18:12.778
Listen, the only time DeBrie
can keep food down

18:12.820 --> 18:14.279
is for about 20 minutes
after she comes crashing

18:14.321 --> 18:15.489
off the methadone, so...

18:15.531 --> 18:17.033
- Oh...
- would you care to join us

18:17.075 --> 18:18.617
as we rustle up some grub

18:18.659 --> 18:20.494
to shove down our mouths?

18:20.536 --> 18:22.246
I would like that very much.

18:22.287 --> 18:24.248
So Tobias and Lindsay drove

18:24.289 --> 18:26.375
to meet their
new friends for lunch.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.878
They are such a neat couple!

18:28.920 --> 18:30.504
Aren't they neat!

18:30.546 --> 18:32.048
It's so fun to have another
couple to go out with.

18:32.090 --> 18:33.591
He's amazing.

18:33.632 --> 18:35.927
I mean, so passionate
about real issues.

18:35.968 --> 18:38.179
He's a real activist--
like me.

18:38.221 --> 18:40.973
And she's a real actress,
like me!

18:41.015 --> 18:43.059
Oh, she used to be
in big movies,

18:43.101 --> 18:45.269
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go...

18:45.310 --> 18:46.395
Mm!

18:46.437 --> 18:47.605
But she is the perfect age

18:47.646 --> 18:50.233
to be a Hollywood actress--42.

18:50.274 --> 18:51.483
Is that all?

18:51.525 --> 18:52.944
Oh, I think this is the place.

18:52.985 --> 18:55.029
It's a barter restaurant.

18:55.071 --> 18:56.989
Marky doesn't believe in money.

18:57.031 --> 18:59.033
Do I like barter?

18:59.075 --> 19:01.160
No, it means
they don't deal with money.

19:01.202 --> 19:02.828
That's why I swiped
that methadone tray.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.496
Hmm.

19:04.538 --> 19:06.791
What interesting friends
we've made.

19:06.832 --> 19:09.877
I think this is exactly
what our marriage needed.

19:16.634 --> 19:17.718
Lindsay and Tobias gathered

19:17.760 --> 19:19.137
with their new friends...

19:19.178 --> 19:20.263
Hi, y'all!
This your first time...?

19:20.304 --> 19:22.723
...at CW Swappigans,

19:22.765 --> 19:25.392
a chain that sprung up
after the economic collapse.

19:25.434 --> 19:28.687
We are like a Salvation Army
meets a soup kitchen,

19:28.729 --> 19:30.439
meets a gastro pub,

19:30.481 --> 19:33.776
meets a Marxist-or
Leninist-type social structure.

19:33.818 --> 19:35.527
These are things
that you can order

19:35.569 --> 19:37.529
and these are things
that we will accept.

19:37.571 --> 19:40.658
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish,

19:40.699 --> 19:42.367
and we're not taking
any more lava lamps.

19:42.409 --> 19:44.829
Uh-oh!
I can see this one's got

19:44.870 --> 19:46.413
that deer
in the headlights look!

19:46.455 --> 19:48.874
Oh, no.
He just took some methadone.

19:48.916 --> 19:52.044
He thought he was driving,
with a cocktail tray.

19:52.086 --> 19:53.671
Oh, speaking of that...

19:53.712 --> 19:55.798
How about mozzarella sticks
for the table?

19:55.840 --> 19:59.010
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks.

19:59.051 --> 20:01.720
Six, no sauce.

20:01.762 --> 20:04.640
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

20:04.682 --> 20:06.976
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no
longer taking hotel soaps.

20:07.018 --> 20:08.519
This is fun.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.604
A lot of people couldn't handle

20:10.646 --> 20:12.439
a Dumpster dive
for their first double date.

20:12.481 --> 20:15.484
Is that what this is?

20:16.777 --> 20:18.112
Now, wait... wait a second.

20:18.154 --> 20:20.614
I wasn't driving?

20:20.656 --> 20:23.117
It's just so refreshing
to meet people

20:23.159 --> 20:26.078
with real passion
about changing the status quo.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.374
Lindsay and I
don't have a single friend.

20:30.415 --> 20:31.625
Is the food here yet?

20:31.667 --> 20:34.419
I'm not hungry,
but... but, uh...

20:34.461 --> 20:36.922
- Oh, look, it's butter.
- DeBrie.

20:39.008 --> 20:40.634
DeBrie, that's our butter.

20:40.676 --> 20:42.970
We were going to swap it
for dessert.

20:43.012 --> 20:45.056
No, she's improvising.
Uh, yes, ma'am.

20:45.097 --> 20:47.099
You seem to be liking
that butter substitute

20:47.141 --> 20:48.392
at Swappigans.

20:48.433 --> 20:49.852
Uh, yes, and...

20:49.894 --> 20:52.104
wh-what else could you swap for?

20:52.146 --> 20:54.523
Uh, yes, and... uh...

20:54.565 --> 20:55.983
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

20:56.025 --> 20:57.568
I... I don't know who my guy is.

20:57.609 --> 20:59.028
I don't... I don't have a guy.

20:59.070 --> 21:00.404
No, she just likes butter.

21:00.445 --> 21:02.073
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

21:02.114 --> 21:03.490
- Don't touch anything.
- Marky, I'll take her.

21:03.532 --> 21:04.825
You two just got here.

21:04.867 --> 21:06.535
Have a chat about.
I'll clean her up.

21:06.577 --> 21:08.329
- Come on, DeBrie.
- Num, num, num, num.

21:08.371 --> 21:09.830
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

21:09.872 --> 21:11.332
I-I love it here.

21:11.374 --> 21:13.500
My mother would hate this place.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.294
You know, Lindsay,
I-I have to tell you,

21:15.336 --> 21:17.588
when I first met you,
I thought you were one of those

21:17.629 --> 21:21.425
typical, uptight, snobby,
Newport Beach,

21:21.466 --> 21:23.552
vapid... nut-busters!

21:25.804 --> 21:27.056
You know, one of those monsters

21:27.098 --> 21:28.599
that lives in
a 10,000-square-foot house

21:28.640 --> 21:30.101
that they destroyed
the wetlands for.

21:30.142 --> 21:31.810
Those were wetlands?

21:31.852 --> 21:34.272
That explains
our Thanksgiving miracle.

21:34.313 --> 21:35.856
What do you mean,
you didn't make dinner?

21:35.898 --> 21:37.566
I didn't realize
it was Thursday, okay?

21:37.608 --> 21:39.318
There's got to be
something here.

21:40.736 --> 21:42.196
Oh! Oh!

21:42.238 --> 21:44.031
Oh! Get it! Get it!

21:44.073 --> 21:45.741
Chase it into the oven!

21:45.783 --> 21:48.077
Come on. Come on.
Here, little ducky.

21:48.119 --> 21:49.828
- That's a good duck.
- Good duck.

21:49.870 --> 21:52.290
In you go!

21:52.331 --> 21:55.626
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.878
It's a miracle!

21:57.920 --> 21:59.588
Well, I actually do live

21:59.630 --> 22:01.340
in a fairly large house
right now.

22:01.382 --> 22:02.967
But we've never made
a payment on it.

22:03.008 --> 22:04.551
So you're sticking it
to Big Banking.

22:04.593 --> 22:06.720
- That's cool.
- Yes.

22:06.762 --> 22:08.639
In fact, I'm only in America

22:08.680 --> 22:10.349
because a shaman told me
that love

22:10.391 --> 22:12.601
would come to me
when I accepted who I am

22:12.643 --> 22:14.519
- and didn't run away.
- Sounds like a good shaman.

22:14.561 --> 22:17.606
Oh, he was the house shaman
at the Four Seasons Mumbai,

22:17.648 --> 22:20.483
so you figure
he's got to be pretty good.

22:20.525 --> 22:23.404
Oh, and he turned into
an ostrich at the end, so...

22:23.446 --> 22:25.823
They're not going to have that
at the Embassy Suites.

22:25.864 --> 22:28.909
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

22:28.951 --> 22:33.205
♪ Co... incidence! ♪

22:33.247 --> 22:35.291
That's not a coincidence.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.584
♪ Yes, it is. ♪

22:37.626 --> 22:39.837
Mini pizzas, no pepperoni!

22:39.878 --> 22:41.297
Marky, I've got to tell you,

22:41.339 --> 22:42.965
talking about these
social issues, it's...

22:43.007 --> 22:45.550
the first time I've felt
like myself

22:45.592 --> 22:47.178
in a really long time.

22:47.219 --> 22:50.055
That's because I say
what I mean, I do what I feel.

22:50.097 --> 22:51.474
No lies.

22:51.514 --> 22:52.933
Lindsay felt guilty

22:52.975 --> 22:54.810
because she was about
to go enter

22:54.852 --> 22:56.854
a crab house/courtroom
and do just that.

22:56.895 --> 22:58.314
That's why my motto is:

22:58.356 --> 23:01.025
"Live truthfully
and skate through life."

23:01.066 --> 23:04.153
Marky felt guilty
because it wasn't his motto.

23:04.195 --> 23:07.198
It was the motto of a surf
and skateboard company.

23:07.239 --> 23:08.407
Live truthfully.

23:08.449 --> 23:09.950
Skate through life.

23:11.035 --> 23:12.535
That's amazing.

23:12.577 --> 23:14.038
I haven't felt this deep

23:14.079 --> 23:17.249
a connection with someone
in a long, long time.

23:20.878 --> 23:22.671
Other than DeBrie.

23:22.713 --> 23:24.631
I can't believe
we just did that.

23:24.673 --> 23:26.591
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

23:26.633 --> 23:28.677
So, where do you keep
your ostriches?

23:28.719 --> 23:30.012
Sheraton mini soap
for a taco salad?

23:30.054 --> 23:31.763
We don't take hotel soap!

23:31.805 --> 23:33.724
And perhaps it was
to get back at her mother...

23:33.765 --> 23:36.185
- Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
- ...or to get out of

23:36.227 --> 23:38.854
a relationship that had
been over for a long time,

23:38.896 --> 23:40.856
but that's when
Lindsay hopped off

23:40.898 --> 23:44.026
to pursue a life
she felt was her destiny.

23:44.068 --> 23:46.611
And the new lovers
discovered each other.

23:46.653 --> 23:48.989
The beautiful female body,

23:49.031 --> 23:51.242
the horrible male.

23:56.872 --> 23:59.291
Wow. That was so...

23:59.333 --> 24:01.168
- fast.
- Thanks.

24:01.210 --> 24:03.754
Well, I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

24:03.795 --> 24:05.297
Oh! And it sounds

24:05.339 --> 24:07.550
- like it's moving, so...
- Move it!

24:07.590 --> 24:08.633
Come on! Come on!

24:08.675 --> 24:10.844
- Let's go!
- Careful!

24:10.886 --> 24:14.181
And as they drove, they learned
so much about each other.

24:14.223 --> 24:16.641
I was always just
in such a rush to grow up

24:16.683 --> 24:19.019
and change this world,
and foolishly,

24:19.061 --> 24:21.397
the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth,

24:21.439 --> 24:24.191
so this guy all the way
to that guy back there,

24:24.233 --> 24:26.485
that's a... just a piece
of wood I stick in there.

24:26.527 --> 24:27.945
I mean, they're just
chewing tools.

24:27.986 --> 24:29.696
I don't care about looks.

24:29.738 --> 24:31.949
But you find me pretty,
though, right?

24:31.990 --> 24:33.242
No.

24:33.284 --> 24:34.910
I have no idea
what you look like.

24:34.952 --> 24:36.703
I have this condition
called face blindness.

24:36.745 --> 24:38.747
I mean, I can tell
you're a woman.

24:38.789 --> 24:40.165
Oh, stop.

24:40.207 --> 24:42.667
But, honestly, no,
all I see is, like,

24:42.709 --> 24:46.130
eyes and nose, you know,
hair, ears and...

24:46.171 --> 24:48.549
But I can tell you got
a great heart, Lindsay.

24:48.591 --> 24:50.593
I can tell
you've been living a lie.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.886
You and I are going to change
this world together.

24:54.138 --> 24:56.390
You know, my shaman

24:56.432 --> 24:58.641
told me that I should stop
caring about appearances.

24:58.683 --> 25:02.229
You know, my whole life, that's
all anyone has ever praised.

25:02.271 --> 25:04.647
All my mom ever cared about.

25:04.689 --> 25:06.775
Because I'm really pretty.

25:06.817 --> 25:10.028
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.864
- I don't care.
- But I guess it's kind of karma

25:12.906 --> 25:15.534
that I ended up with someone
who wanted to make love to me

25:15.576 --> 25:16.952
no matter what I look like.

25:16.994 --> 25:19.121
Also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

25:19.163 --> 25:22.291
I can tell with voices usually,
but some guys, they'll...

25:22.333 --> 25:25.294
they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

25:25.336 --> 25:27.463
Hey...

25:28.880 --> 25:31.550
Are you smiling at me?

25:31.592 --> 25:33.302
Lindsay decided
it was only fair

25:33.344 --> 25:35.262
to let her husband know

25:35.304 --> 25:37.515
their new start
had reached a new end.

25:37.556 --> 25:38.932
I left.

25:38.974 --> 25:40.142
I guess you noticed.

25:40.184 --> 25:41.852
Um, look, I'm sorry.

25:41.893 --> 25:45.564
I-I really do care about you,
Tobias, but we were trying

25:45.606 --> 25:48.442
to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

25:48.484 --> 25:51.612
And I have to follow
my shaman's advice. I...

25:51.654 --> 25:56.116
I have to be true
to myself for once.

25:56.158 --> 25:59.911
And Marky, he sees me
for who I really am.

25:59.953 --> 26:02.039
- He respects me and...
- Come on, lady!

26:02.080 --> 26:03.415
You want to wrap this up?

26:03.457 --> 26:05.167
My lady needs to call
her loser ex.

26:05.209 --> 26:07.336
Marky, it's me.

26:07.378 --> 26:08.920
It's Lindsay.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.048
Oh.

26:11.089 --> 26:12.466
I thought you
were taking a dump.

26:12.508 --> 26:13.551
Oh, I must have
scared the

26:13.592 --> 26:15.135
off that lady in the bathroom

26:15.177 --> 26:18.430
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

26:20.599 --> 26:22.184
He loves me?

26:22.226 --> 26:23.768
Sorry. False alarm.

26:23.810 --> 26:25.270
- I don't love you.
- Uh, I got to go.

26:25.312 --> 26:27.064
Can you delete this
so I can leave

26:27.105 --> 26:28.607
- a message for Maeby?
- It's good. She's fine.

26:28.649 --> 26:30.609
And soon, the lovers arrived

26:30.651 --> 26:33.571
and discovered the joys
of their new desert home,

26:33.612 --> 26:36.699
dancing and making love
all night.

26:36.739 --> 26:39.826
Now, that time...

26:39.868 --> 26:41.704
was also very quick.

26:41.744 --> 26:45.290
And now we've freed the night up
to dance again.

26:45.332 --> 26:46.542
- Come on.
- Oh. Okay.

26:46.584 --> 26:48.043
And the next day,

26:48.085 --> 26:49.920
Lindsay awoke
to discover the destiny

26:49.961 --> 26:53.924
foretold to her in India
in drab colors before her.

26:53.965 --> 26:55.884
Get away from her.

26:55.926 --> 26:57.010
Don't mess with her!

26:57.052 --> 26:58.220
She's none of your business.

26:58.262 --> 26:59.930
Thank you.

26:59.971 --> 27:02.015
I said get away from her,
you slut!

27:02.057 --> 27:02.974
You're scaring the bird.

27:03.016 --> 27:04.518
No, no, Mom.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.228
Mom, she's with us.

27:06.270 --> 27:08.313
She lives with us now.

27:08.355 --> 27:11.650
And, Mom,
she tells me she's pretty.

27:11.692 --> 27:14.737
I have the worst  shaman.

27:22.202 --> 27:26.164
The defense calls to the
oyster bar thing where they sit

27:26.206 --> 27:27.916
the adopted daughter,
Lindsay Bluth.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.461
Another chair is empty

27:30.502 --> 27:32.003
- at Lucille's trial.
- Lindsay...

27:32.045 --> 27:33.880
Mr. Zuckerkorn,

27:33.922 --> 27:37.008
Shrimp-Shooter Nights
starts in 15 minutes.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.260
Is your witness going to appear?

27:38.302 --> 27:40.304
"Appear."

27:40.345 --> 27:43.390
Oh, I thought the one
on the pier was a Bubba Gump's.

27:45.016 --> 27:47.352
And, in an effort
to be less glamorous,

27:47.394 --> 27:50.397
Lindsay cuts her hair
only to discover,

27:50.439 --> 27:53.108
- much to her frustration...
- Great. Even cuter.

27:53.150 --> 27:55.193
And Tobias becomes addicted

27:55.235 --> 27:58.071
- to his new profession.
- I'm an addict, and I'm starving.

27:58.113 --> 28:00.407
Yes, you are starving,
so would you like some butter?

28:00.449 --> 28:01.784
I could give you some butter,

28:01.866 --> 28:04.703
and, uh, you can pay for it
w-with a shoe.

28:04.745 --> 28:06.455
Um... I'm sorry, but, uh,

28:06.497 --> 28:08.999
his guy's not giving my guy
anything, uh, to react to.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.543
Uh, could I get some more
of that, uh, acting juice?

28:11.955 --> 28:14.632
