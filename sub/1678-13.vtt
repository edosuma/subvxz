<i>OLDER TED; Kids, in life there are a lot of</i>
<i>big romantic moments,</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:21.148
<i>and they make life worth living,</i>

00:21.254 --> 00:22.653
<i>But here's the problem,</i>

00:22.756 --> 00:24.155
<i>Moments pass,</i>

00:24.257 --> 00:26.953
<i>And lurking just around the corner</i>
<i>from those moments</i>

00:27.060 --> 00:30.689
<i>is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality,</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:33.528
<i>And so, back in 2006,</i>

00:33.633 --> 00:36.158
<i>on the night of</i>
<i>Claudia and Stuart's wedding,</i>

00:36.269 --> 00:37.964
<i>reality was the enemy,</i>

00:38.104 --> 00:40.072
Wow, the Peace Corps?

00:40.173 --> 00:42.971
Yeah, I ship out tomorrow. Two years.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.238
You know, some people say

00:45.345 --> 00:48.041
the Peace Corps is the most noble thing
a person can do.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.343
To those people I say, "Is it?"

00:50.450 --> 00:53.010
And usually, they say, "Yes, it is."

00:53.553 --> 00:55.680
But, Barney, they are so right.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.950
Wish there was something I could do.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.891
Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.396
<i>This wasn't how I'd thought</i>
<i>the night would turn out,</i>

01:05.865 --> 01:09.426
<i>This was finally supposed to be</i>
<i>my big moment with Robin,</i>

01:09.569 --> 01:11.127
<i>but then reality came along,</i>

01:11.838 --> 01:15.569
<i>Robin got called up last minute</i>
<i>to anchor the 11,{{{{{00 news,</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:17.142
<i>It was her big break,</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:19.575
<i>And I went to the wedding stag,</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:22.514
<i>Then, when I least expected it,,,</i>

01:33.026 --> 01:36.086
Hey, where the hell
did you disappear to last night?

01:36.196 --> 01:39.256
I had the most amazing night ever.

01:39.365 --> 01:42.163
Tell me about it.
That cake! Best cake I ever had.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.031
Seriously. My stomach was like,

01:44.137 --> 01:46.833
"Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating,
'cause I don't have any eyes,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.773
"but it's basically awesome.
So keep sending it down gullet alley."

01:49.876 --> 01:51.867
Yeah, I know. My stomach was like,

01:51.978 --> 01:55.277
"Girlfriend, we don't always get along,
but that cake..."

01:55.381 --> 01:56.439
TED: Lily?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.245
Oh, right.
Most amazing night ever, and go.

02:01.087 --> 02:03.954
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.287
I never hook up at weddings.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.756
I'm guessing
you haven't always had this rule.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.320
Well, here's the thing.
Those big, romantic moments,

02:12.432 --> 02:15.299
they're great when they happen,
but they're not real.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.562
Exactly. Exactly. Like just now,

02:17.670 --> 02:19.467
when I saw you
doing the Chicken Dance out there,

02:19.572 --> 02:22.336
I'm not gonna lie to you,
big time thunderbolt.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.876
You should see me tap dance.
You'd be down on bended knee.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.640
Sadly, not out of character.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.847
But, I know now, it's just a mirage.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.282
- Wedding goggles.
- Exactly.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.219
And that, in a nutshell,
is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.382
- This isn't the moves?
- What, you... You think this is the moves?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.255
Believe me, you'd know the moves.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.228
People 10 tables away
would know the moves.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.798
- That's too bad.
- Tell me about it.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.626
You know, I think I have a solution.

02:50.737 --> 02:51.897
Interested.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.771
And to preface this,
we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.501
Less interested.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.836
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

02:59.979 --> 03:04.473
So the thing that always screws it up
is the next day. Right?

03:04.617 --> 03:08.053
So, why don't we just cut that part out?

03:08.421 --> 03:12.152
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, I'm here, you're here.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.556
This is a big, romantic wedding.

03:14.661 --> 03:18.153
Why don't we just dance
and have a great time?

03:18.264 --> 03:21.563
And then when it's over,
never see each other again.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.030
- Unless...
- No, no unless.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.733
No emails, no phone numbers,
not even names.

03:30.410 --> 03:35.347
Tonight, we will make a memory
that will never be tarnished.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.507
And then, when we're old and gray,

03:38.918 --> 03:41.045
we'll look back on this night,

03:41.154 --> 03:43.281
and it'll be perfect.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.682
Wow.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.194
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.525
I guess... What, we'll need fake names?

03:52.699 --> 03:54.724
You can call me Buttercup.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.726
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I'm Lando Calrissian.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.542
Wow, this is kind of exciting.
Our names will forever be shrouded in...

04:03.643 --> 04:05.338
Ted, Ted, Ted, look. I got a bridesmaid.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.675
Ted, look. Look, Ted.
The second hottest bridesmaid!

04:07.780 --> 04:09.441
Ted, look. See you, Ted.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.451
So, I'm Ted.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.849
Victoria.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.089
- But no last names.
- No last names.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.056
What is wrong with you?

04:23.162 --> 04:27.394
Yeah, dude, that is just like
a weenie ass idea.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.058
No, it was awesome. I had a great night.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.002
I'm never going to see her again.
And there's no way to ruin it.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.506
Ted, how do I explain this to you?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.972
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.443
Now you think I'm gonna let that cake
out of my life? Hell, no.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.945
I'm gonna find out
what bakery made that cake,

04:42.048 --> 04:44.278
and damn it,
I'm gonna get some more cake.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.147
That cake really got to you, huh?

04:46.653 --> 04:47.779
It haunts me.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.751
So, what happened next?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.784
Okay, ground rules have been established.

04:54.927 --> 04:58.260
Now, let's see some of these moves
I've heard so much about.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.237
Wait, wait, wait.

05:06.906 --> 05:11.400
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint
a big favor and steal the bouquet.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.605
Yes, but we'll need a diversion.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.743
Kiss!

ALL: Kiss! Kiss!

05:18.184 --> 05:20.948
(ALL CHEERING) Kiss, come on. Kiss! Kiss!

05:21.054 --> 05:22.146
Go, go, go.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.018
So, that's what happened to the bouquet.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.957
You know, good for Victoria.
It's such an evil tradition.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.655
- You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
- Oh, yeah!

05:31.764 --> 05:35.131
I'm gonna take that flower grenade
and chuck it into the crowd and scream,

05:35.234 --> 05:37.099
"Crawl for it, bitches!"

05:37.904 --> 05:39.872
It's just what girls do.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.005
So, where'd you guys go?

05:42.208 --> 05:45.006
(TED PLAYING <i>THE ENTERTAINER</i>
ON THE PIANO)

05:53.319 --> 05:54.980
- Very nice.
- Yeah?

05:57.590 --> 05:59.080
Okay, I don't really know
how to tap dance.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.352
I couldn't tell.

06:02.829 --> 06:06.094
Oh, it's too bad
you're not gonna get some tonight!

06:06.232 --> 06:08.757
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.495
No, you couldn't.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.070
You're a dude.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.632
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.707
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.008
(BANGS PIANO KEYS)

06:24.016 --> 06:27.577
I mean, if we kiss, all of this becomes real.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.383
You might use too much tongue,
I might not use enough.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.789
And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.885
I will use exactly the right amount
of tongue.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.194
Okay, how about this?

06:42.135 --> 06:46.401
The best part of any first kiss
is the lead up to it.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.775
The moment right before the lips touch.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.039
It's like a big drum roll.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.577
So, how about tonight

06:56.682 --> 06:59.082
we just stick with the drum roll.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.278
- Okay.
- But we can't kiss.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.617
Okay.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.811
A drum roll? That's it?

07:29.048 --> 07:32.415
So, what? You just...
You said good night, came home,

07:33.186 --> 07:34.813
and performed a drum solo?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.287
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!

07:38.424 --> 07:40.221
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.123
She was completely amazing.

07:42.228 --> 07:46.494
She was amazing and funny
and we connected on every level,

07:46.599 --> 07:48.965
and I'm never gonna see her again.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.802
Damn it, I have to see her again.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.235
- Yes!
- Yes!

07:53.906 --> 07:56.340
So let's get to work, man.
What else do you know about her?

07:56.442 --> 07:58.967
Nothing, her name's Victoria.
That's all I got.

07:59.078 --> 08:00.773
Wait, Claudia. Claudia would know.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.576
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.
She'll be back in two weeks.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.083
- Call her then.
- Yes, two weeks. Good idea.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.454
- I'm calling her now.
- No, Ted.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.489
- You don't mess with a honeymoon.
- Yeah, come on, dude.

Great wedding, beautiful toast,
touching stuff. How's the honeymoon?

08:22.034 --> 08:24.025
Listen, I'm calling because
last night I met this girl,

08:24.136 --> 08:25.831
and I was wondering if you had...

08:25.938 --> 08:28.998
Oh, you have got to be
freaking kidding me!

08:29.108 --> 08:30.336
Here we go.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.741
Twenty-four hours ago,
you were begging, begging me

08:33.846 --> 08:37.679
to bring some other girl to my wedding
and now, what, you're over her?

08:37.817 --> 08:38.943
I've moved on.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.917
What was her name?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsey?

08:42.054 --> 08:43.817
Don't be embarrassed.
She has pretty eyes.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.949
No. Her name was Victoria.
I don't know her last name.

08:47.059 --> 08:51.462
Well, lucky for you. I know that guest list
backwards and forwards.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.929
Thank God!

08:53.032 --> 08:56.627
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria
at my wedding. Goodbye, Ted.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.168
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.872
Maybe she used a second fake name.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.175
Oh, she's good. She's very good.

09:10.283 --> 09:13.741
Maybe she was a ghost.
That's why she didn't want to kiss you.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.788
Because you'd just pass right through her
and feel really cold for a second.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.119
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea
for a screenplay.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.489
Marshall, she was not a ghost.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.456
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.259
She picked up a bouquet
proving she had corporeal form.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.493
Wait! She was sitting across
from a couple of bridesmaids.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.797
She must have been at their table.
Maybe they know who she was.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.771
Great! So, how do we get in touch
with the bridesmaids?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.944
This better be good.
I'm about to enter Nirvana.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.878
By the way, I should get you
Nirvana's phone number.

Listen, Barney. I saw you talking
to that bridesmaid last night.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.759
- Did you happen to get her phone number?
- You know I did.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.456
Great! I'm gonna need you
to call her for me.

Why not?

Because, we just hooked up last night.
I can't call the girl the next day.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.807
I have to wait at least, like, forever.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.877
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.608
Besides, she thinks
I'm on my way to India.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.706
Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.

10:18.484 --> 10:23.285
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl
is exactly not a good cause.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.687
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you.
My hands are tied.

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.489
You make this call

10:33.599 --> 10:37.626
and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.702
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.296
But, you always said
the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy,

10:42.408 --> 10:45.673
- nor good at boxing.
- I'm ready to be proven wrong.

- Tonight?
- Tonight!

Yeah, Tanya. Turns out I don't leave
for the Peace Corps until tomorrow.

Yeah, I know. It sucks.

Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was?

11:00.526 --> 11:02.687
Hold on. What kind of shoes was she...

11:02.795 --> 11:04.262
No, Tanya, he's a dude.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.422
He's not gonna know
what kind of shoes she was wearing.

11:06.532 --> 11:07.692

11:28.254 --> 11:32.623
Apparently, she was wearing brown shoes

11:33.325 --> 11:35.623
with little snowflakes on them.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.154
Yeah, they do sound cute.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.323
Any idea who...

11:42.401 --> 11:45.234
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take care.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.599
What's...

11:46.706 --> 11:47.730
Tonight?

11:47.840 --> 11:50.400
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early.

11:50.509 --> 11:53.444
So, I won't be able to stay over,
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.741
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.940
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able
to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.347
I understand.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.477
Okay. Let's not lose hope.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.283
We'll call the hotel.
Maybe she was staying there.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.359
We'll have them check the registry
for anyone named Victoria.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.623
- Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...
- Or Ictor.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.265
She probably doesn't go by Ictor.

12:16.635 --> 12:20.628
No, you know what? This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.141
That was the whole point of the night.
I've just been saved from myself.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.108
- Let's drink many beers.
- Agreed.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.276
<i>And I thought that was the end of it,</i>
<i>But then,,,</i>

12:29.381 --> 12:30.507
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:34.253 --> 12:36.744
- Hey, there's the anchor lady.
- Hello.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.824
- How was it?
- Oh, I don't know.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.358
Why don't you ask the new substitute
weekend anchor?

12:41.460 --> 12:44.156
Robin? Thanks, Robin. It was awesome.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.561
- Back to you, Robin.
- Congrats!

12:46.665 --> 12:48.189
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.393
Yeah, I felt really bad
bailing on Ted though.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.835
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

12:52.938 --> 12:55.031
<i>And then Lily told her the whole story,</i>

12:55.141 --> 12:58.474
<i>right down to the brown shoes</i>
<i>with the little snowflakes on them,</i>

12:58.577 --> 12:59.839
<i>And by the end of it,,,</i>

13:01.413 --> 13:02.539
What?

13:03.215 --> 13:04.842
I know who she is.

13:09.488 --> 13:13.015
You know who she is?
But you weren't even at the wedding.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.385
Actually I kind of was.

13:16.862 --> 13:17.920
What?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.428
Well, after the newscast I was so excited,

13:20.533 --> 13:23.832
I decided to surprise Ted
by going to the reception.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.906
Oh, damn it.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.749
Oh, stop it.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.519
What the hell?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.382
VICTORIA: Hello?

13:43.689 --> 13:44.883
You okay in there?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.582
Yeah, I'm fine!

13:47.693 --> 13:51.151
Just allergies or something. I'm fine.

13:53.465 --> 13:56.730
Listen, do you wanna come
and cry out here?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.228
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.669
Oh, thanks.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.932
But I don't actually cry in front of people

14:04.043 --> 14:07.171
or cry at all for that matter.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.074
Man, it's gross.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.985
Does everyone snot up this much
when they cry?

14:14.220 --> 14:16.882
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.588
So, why you crying?

14:21.894 --> 14:24.294
Because you have feelings for Ted.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.296
I don't know. Maybe?

14:27.399 --> 14:31.301
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you?
Seriously!

14:31.437 --> 14:35.203
He likes you, and you like him,
and just be together!

14:35.374 --> 14:37.968
Jeez, Louise,
happiness is not that difficult.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.408
Oh, look, okay.

14:39.511 --> 14:43.174
Yes, I cried in the bathroom
and that was weird.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.842
But that doesn't mean
I'm in love with the guy.

14:45.951 --> 14:48.647
The fact is, I don't know how I feel.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.119
Yes, you do.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.747
Seeing him with someone else
and crying about it?

14:52.858 --> 14:54.655
Guess what? That's how you feel!

14:54.760 --> 14:57.160
That is nothing but how you feel.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.426
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.091
Kind of, yeah.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.102
But it doesn't change anything.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.902
I still don't wanna get married,
and he's still Ted.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.870
What I should do is just tell him
who Victoria is, so he can be happy.

15:15.981 --> 15:20.645
Or you could tell him that you're into him
and then you could both be happy.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.651
I'm gonna go find him.

15:23.622 --> 15:24.987
Well, wait.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.990
Which one are you gonna tell him?

15:28.394 --> 15:29.918
I have no idea.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.688
And here's the most amazing part.

15:32.798 --> 15:36.165
Because I told her I had converted
all my money to India dollars,

15:36.268 --> 15:39.203
she gave me $50 to take a cab
to the airport.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.933
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.569
I really should give this money
to the Peace Corps.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.577
They've done so much for me lately.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.510
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.511
Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.175
Sure, what's up?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.411
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:54.520 --> 15:56.715
I have to tell you something.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.882
Oh, just get it.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.057
- Hello?
- Ted? It's Stuart.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.058
My lovely bride would like to say
something to you.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.437
Ted.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.439
I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.738
My new husband and vodka cranberry,

16:18.844 --> 16:22.678
which cost $10.50
at the freaking airport bar...

16:22.781 --> 16:25.648
<i>- When is this plane going to board?</i>
- Sweet pea.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.118
(CLEARING THROAT)

16:28.721 --> 16:33.658
...have helped me realize that
sometimes I can act like a crazy person.

16:34.226 --> 16:38.094
And I don't want my new husband to think
I'm a crazy person.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.759
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.468
Marshall wanted to know
where you guys got that cake.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.696
Cake?

16:47.339 --> 16:49.273
Why don't you take this?

16:50.709 --> 16:52.609
Sounds like you could use it.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.373
Thanks. You're very sweet.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.908
So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?

16:59.251 --> 17:01.276
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.111
Actually, neither.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.814
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.823
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.483
I made the cake.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.960
She made the cake.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.661
Buttercup Bakery!

17:19.771 --> 17:22.502
She wasn't on the guest list,
because she wasn't a guest.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.132
She made the cake!

17:24.242 --> 17:27.872
She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.112
You gotta marry her. Today.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.739
She has to move in with us.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.375
- I'm going down to that bakery.
- No, no, don't do it.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.852
Baby, what are you talking about?

17:36.955 --> 17:40.220
Yeah, all day long you've been busting
my apple bag about finding this girl.

17:40.325 --> 17:44.386
Well, I just think that
maybe she's not that into you.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.522
And that's why
she didn't give you her number.

17:48.667 --> 17:52.103
Robin, care to chime in with anything?

17:53.939 --> 17:55.031
Yes.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.166
Ted,

18:00.512 --> 18:01.877
go get her.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.572
Going. Getting!

18:03.682 --> 18:05.013
Ted. Oh, my gosh, I love this moment.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.209
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna say it.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.546
And this time,
you're actually gonna say yes.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.315
You ready? You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up!

18:10.422 --> 18:11.514
Yes!

18:11.790 --> 18:13.758
- No.
- Oh, come on!

18:16.228 --> 18:19.425
- Guess we were gone a while.
- Oh, that's too bad.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.295
I was looking forward to one last dance.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.942
<i>(MUSIC PLA YING ON CD PLA YER)</i>

18:43.522 --> 18:44.955
Why, yes, I am.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.415
Sorry, I could tell
what you were just thinking.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.653
Wow, what was I just thinking?

18:49.761 --> 18:52.059
Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.698
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.328
You know, I don't look like this every day.

18:58.437 --> 19:01.497
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears
a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt

19:01.607 --> 19:02.972
with bleach stains on it.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.542
The real Ted sounds real sexy.

19:08.413 --> 19:11.007
It's too bad I'll never get to see it.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.752
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

19:18.857 --> 19:21.587
Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.331
Ted? You still with us?

19:40.412 --> 19:42.277
Tell me your last name.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.116
You know, there's one little flaw
in our plan.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.619
What's that?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.349
I'm gonna go home tonight
with a lot of great memories,

19:52.491 --> 19:54.584
and one really sucky memory.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.057
The memory of you walking out that door.

20:01.733 --> 20:02.995
Hey, Ted.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.394
Yeah?

20:05.938 --> 20:09.465
Close your eyes and count to five.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.570
One.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.438
Two.

20:17.449 --> 20:18.643
Three.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.411
Four.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.647
Five.

<i>TED; Until our dying days, we'll remember</i>
<i>everything about that night</i>

20:43.075 --> 20:45.043
Maybe we both need that.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.474
I mean, so many things go wrong in life,

20:47.579 --> 20:49.410
but this is the one thing that never will.

20:49.514 --> 20:53.507
It will always, always be pure,

20:53.619 --> 20:55.644
unadulterated, awesome.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.817
If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us
of what could be...

20:59.925 --> 21:02.587
The meter's running, dude.
Crap or get off the pot.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.161
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.
