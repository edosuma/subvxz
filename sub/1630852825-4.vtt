WEBVTT

00:25.859 --> 00:28.862
Church Missions House, built in the 1890s.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.531
45,000 square feet. Six floors.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.616
She knows the building better than I do.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.785
-Maybe she should be the realtor.
-No.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.370
Shall we go in?

00:45.462 --> 00:48.882
So the Anna Delvey Foundation
is a private club,

00:48.965 --> 00:51.885
but it's also a dynamic
visual arts center.

00:51.968 --> 00:57.140
I want it to be a place for people with
taste, a step beyond the VIP room.

00:57.223 --> 01:01.061
When you're in,
you know you're special. Exclusive.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.230
Not just one big space.

01:04.314 --> 01:09.611
I want it to be a series of small,
cozy lounges with private butlers.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.905
Clubs within the club.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.949
Exactly. That's what I was imagining.

01:19.287 --> 01:23.792
Maybe a rotating array
of pop-up shops, exhibitions

01:23.875 --> 01:26.586
and installations in this area?

01:26.669 --> 01:29.714
But only the most interesting artists.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.258
I think that would feel
fresh and innovative.

01:32.342 --> 01:36.304
Right here, you could leave a void
that can be filled with sculptures.

01:36.387 --> 01:40.308
Huge pieces of art.
Like a Doris Salcedo piece.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.270
I've thought hotel rooms.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.897
Two floors should be enough?

01:45.980 --> 01:48.817
But luxurious. Curated.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.903
I want guests to have
a home away from home.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.781
Richie, this is where
I was hoping for your genius.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.075
I need three restaurants. All different.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.578
One of them doesn't have to be
another Nobu, but I wouldn't mind.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.539
And I'll need a juice bar. Oh!

02:02.622 --> 02:05.375
And a German bakery.
We have to have a German bakery.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.876
My parents will never show up,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.754
but they'd kill me
if I didn't serve strudel.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.261
-Well?
-It's a huge project.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.347
It'll have a huge opening.
Christo's promised to wrap the building.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.516
The building itself will be a work of art.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.351
It'll be the talk of New York.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.061
Right. It's going to be magnificent.

02:25.145 --> 02:25.979
Bravo, Anna.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.065
Since you first saw it,
we've had some other interested parties.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.943
Nobody else sees this place.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.361
I'm taking it.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.612
What's the timeline?

02:34.696 --> 02:37.574
The lease is $4 million a year.
You'll guarantee the renovations?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.741
What's the budget?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.911
Our reno budget was $20 million,
but it's sounding more like $25 million.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.580
Doesn't include restaurants.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.624
So let's round up,
say she needs $40 million to finance.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.751
Sound about right?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.839
She created a business plan.

02:52.922 --> 02:56.885
She pulled in a group
of best-in-class advisors.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.345
Her architect? Gabriel Calatrava.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.473
Architecture royalty,
his father did the World Trade Center.

03:02.557 --> 03:06.728
She had André Balazs
overseeing the addition of hotel rooms.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.481
Richie Notar from Nobu
was on board to put in a restaurant.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.025
Holy shit.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.402
Right? A dream team.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.114
And now, she sees the perfect building.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.408
281 Park Avenue.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.370
Are you okay?

03:24.454 --> 03:26.289
Yeah. I'm sunshine and candy.

03:26.998 --> 03:27.874
Where was I?

03:27.957 --> 03:29.459
You were getting to the good part.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.880
Oh. Anna looks at 281 Park,
says she'll take it.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.131
Are you sure you're okay?

03:35.215 --> 03:38.426
Fine. Ask me who owns 281 Park Avenue.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.636
You don't look okay.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.845
Are you in my uterus? No.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.932
Ask me who owns 281 Park Avenue.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.475
Who owns 281 Park Avenue?

03:46.392 --> 03:47.852
Aby Rosen.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.562
-Aby Rosen?

03:52.565 --> 03:55.944
Anna could have any building she wants,
but she picks a building

03:56.027 --> 03:59.030
owned by the biggest, richest
real estate mogul in Manhattan.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.199
The one with the most lawyers,
the most connections,

04:01.282 --> 04:03.243
the biggest swinging dick.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.953
I'm starting to like this kid.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.412
VIP is better.

04:06.996 --> 04:07.830
Exactly.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.084
She's got the dream team in her pocket,
Aby Rosen on the hook.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.419
In her mind, she's a big dog now.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.172
-Huh.
-She's got this. Can taste it.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.259
All she needs to do
is secure the financing.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.261
All she needs is $40 million.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.097
But nobody would give Anna $40 million.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.060
I'm sorry.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.523
Are you telling me she was actually
being seriously considered for funding?

04:33.606 --> 04:36.651
I can't get a single finance guy to talk
but this is the paperwork.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.946
BFA, Citibank, Fortress.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.825
Anna was a 25-year-old kid
in a baby doll dress

04:43.908 --> 04:45.493
without a dime to her name.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.744
How does that happen?

04:46.828 --> 04:50.790
Who the hell would believe
Anna Delvey was good for $40 million?

05:17.066 --> 05:18.109
It's amazing.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.154
One of my favorites.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.906
I see something new
every time I look at it.

05:23.990 --> 05:24.991
Hmm.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.413
Alan, I thought this might be a good place
for us to discuss Anna Delvey.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.414
Who the hell are you?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.458
Vivian Kent, <i>Manhattan Magazine.</i>

05:33.541 --> 05:34.625
This…

05:34.709 --> 05:37.587
Did you follow me here?
This is harassment.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.671
This is respect.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.257
I could be talking to your doorman.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.467
I'm respecting your wife.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.552
I could be speaking
to your business partner.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.262
I'm respecting your workplace.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.933
Here, we're just two strangers
admiring a painting, chatting about art.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.769
You are not embarrassed.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.021
Your reputation is intact.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.648
No one has to know we spoke.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.901
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.403
How did you meet her?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.821
Why did you help her?

06:09.911 --> 06:10.745
No.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.562
-Morning, Mr. Reed.
-Good morning.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.943
Good morning, Mr. Reed.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.570
-Court 1 is waiting for you.
-Thank you.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.906
We keep Court 1 for the VIPs.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.367
Alan Reed always gets Court 1.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.919
Oh, yes!

07:00.670 --> 07:02.046
Don't strain anything.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.589
Don't be a sore loser.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.300
I thought you were working
through that in couples therapy.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.218
Stopped.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.303
Divorce lawyer's
cheaper than the therapist.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.974
There's someone I want to connect
you with. European heiress.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.225
She's opening a club.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.935
Like Soho House, but more exclusive.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.812
She needs advising.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.021
Can I send her your way?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.148
Let me guess.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.316
You want to split the origination credit?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.861
Of course, and the billables,
if it comes to anything.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.112
We'll see.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.198
-What's her name?
-Anna Delvey.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.884
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

07:49.552 --> 07:54.432
Yeah, man. I'm talking jet skis,
uh, influencers, models.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.643
I mean, literally, it's everything
you can think of under the sun,

07:57.727 --> 07:58.936
in the Bahamas.

07:59.020 --> 08:03.441
And get this,
Ja Rule is partnering with me on this.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.736
Yeah, I'm serious man. Ja-freaking-Rule.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.947
Yeah,
it's going to be awesome.

08:10.031 --> 08:10.907
Exactly.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.410
Yeah, he says he's always on time,
so it's a perfect time to jump on.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.625
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.669
Investors are the worst.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.463
Investors are a bitch move.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.049
I'm all about holding onto my equity.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.051
Full ownership, total control.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.637
Damn, girl.
Living large with that trust fund.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.681
I was going to talk to you.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.517
You should put some money into this.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.353
My list of investors is,
uh, pretty A-list.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.022
Invest in some party
for out-of-towners?

08:43.105 --> 08:45.024
So shady. It's going to be huge.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.277
Thanks, but no.
It's too small-scale for me.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.783
By the way, Billy,
last night's scene was way out of control.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.327
It was a party. You're not even
supposed to be living here.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.624
Lightweight.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.463
Morning, Mr. Reed. I have your usual.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.506
Thank you, Camille.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.612
-Oh. Have a good day.
-You too.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.747
Hey, Jules.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.081
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

10:24.165 --> 10:26.208
<i>Nice tie! It brings out your eyes.</i>

10:26.292 --> 10:27.585
So how's your internship?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.838
Your mom and I are looking forward
to trying your bouillabaisse.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.256
-What happened?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.508
<i>Do you know how sexist kitchens are?</i>

10:34.592 --> 10:37.011
<i>Being in that toxic environment</i>
<i>was hurting my soul.</i>

10:37.094 --> 10:39.055
Couldn't you talk
to your mentor, or your boss?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.973
<i>Of course not. This stuff is top-down.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:42.725
<i>You don't understand, Dad.</i>

10:43.517 --> 10:46.854
<i>There's this amazing retreat</i>
<i>and I need to get away.</i>

10:46.937 --> 10:48.856
<i>My credit card is maxed this month.</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:52.526
<i>Please, Daddy. I just need a break.</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:55.529
Okay, but we need to talk about
what you're going to do next.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.490
Maybe we can find another cooking course?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.283
<i>Dad, I'm not supposed to be a chef.</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:00.951
-But Julia--
<i>-I have to go.</i>

11:01.035 --> 11:02.953
<i>Thank you for the money. Say hi to Mom.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:04.121
<i>-Love you.</i>
-Wait, Julia--

11:38.823 --> 11:41.033
They passed due diligence in record time.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.284
Just to make funds for a CDO.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.745
They've confirmed
that they'll stand surety for the loan,

11:44.829 --> 11:46.997
but without a contingency, at least 12%…

11:47.081 --> 11:49.041
You want in on this. Trust me.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.587
They're appointing new trustees.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.006
But, you know,
the fundamentals are still a shitshow.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.926
l told them they're going to have
to leverage their other holdings

11:59.009 --> 12:00.219
to secure the purchase.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.096
-How did they respond?
-They're scrambling…

12:19.280 --> 12:20.531
You don't like the painting?

12:21.532 --> 12:23.284
Sure. It's interesting.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.869
Mr. Reed. Hi.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.537
Thank you for meeting with me.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.663
Please. Have a seat.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.543
So tell me about your foundation.

12:32.626 --> 12:38.424
ADF, The Anna Delvey Foundation,
is unlike any other social members club.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.259
We're going to differentiate ourselves

12:40.342 --> 12:44.680
through the curation
of an exclusive art world clientele.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.850
How's that different from
Soho House, NeueHouse, The Wing?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.185
It's completely different.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.103
ADF is way better than those places.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.062
How so?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.649
Here's my business plan.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.195
We'll have all the expected
luxurious amenities,

12:59.278 --> 13:02.281
but I want to give my members
more than they expect.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.617
I want to anticipate their needs.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.995
And you've worked in the art
and hospitality world previously?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.164
Um…

13:10.247 --> 13:12.249
No, but I understand--

13:12.333 --> 13:15.586
-This is a huge undertaking, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.088
Where are your metrics, your KPIs?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.632
What's your operating profit margin?

13:20.299 --> 13:21.801
Have you done your market research?

13:21.884 --> 13:26.096
How does your proposed product stack up
against what's already in the marketplace?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.599
I was born into art.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.476
I understand business.

13:30.559 --> 13:34.438
I might be young, but I have experience
and my family's connections.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.233
Of course.
I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.820
But starting a business in New York
is not for the faint-hearted.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.989
I am aware of that, but I plan to succeed.

13:44.782 --> 13:49.203
Maybe it would be easier
to start ADF in Europe,

13:49.286 --> 13:51.789
but New York is where I belong.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.918
My challenge right now
is that my trust is in Germany

13:56.001 --> 13:58.462
and I need capital here in America
to get the ball rolling.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.797
That is a major problem.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.340
Which is why I've come to you.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.927
You have no quantifiable
professional experience in this,

14:05.010 --> 14:06.512
or in any other business.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.556
Plus you have no capital in the States.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.393
It's going to be difficult for you
to secure the support of an American bank

14:12.476 --> 14:13.769
without a track record.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.396
I can't help you.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.441
I can do this.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.236
ADF will be a game changer.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.781
Ms. Delvey, I'm sorry,
but I'm not convinced.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.541
-If you just give me one more chance, I--
-I can't help you.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.167
Thank you for coming in.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.049
It's the 21st century,
but this is still a boy's club.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.594
Think that's why
you had trouble raising funding?

14:46.677 --> 14:51.223
I think I'm 25 and female.

14:51.807 --> 14:57.187
And they take one look at my face
and my ass and make assumptions.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.856
But you kept going?

14:59.398 --> 15:00.649
You really wanted the money.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.028
You have to understand
there's, like…

15:04.111 --> 15:06.906
…an endless supply of money out there.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.283
New York is swimming in capital.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.952
But talent, that's hard to come by.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.539
A vision like mine
doesn't come around all the time.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.333
Genius is rare.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.919
Besides, I don't lose.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.384
-Ms. Delvey--
-I rushed my pitch last time.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.512
But if you hear me out, you'll realize
that ADF is a viable business.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.141
I have the answers to all your questions.
KPIs, metrics, all of it.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.102
Once I've secured the lease
of the building at $4 million a year,

15:37.186 --> 15:39.480
I have a renovation budget
of approximately $40 million.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.898
My advisory board includes

15:40.981 --> 15:44.234
some of the most successful names
in New York real estate and hospitality.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.403
In terms of my lack of capital in America,

15:46.487 --> 15:48.989
I have my trust fund
of approximately $60 million. I can--

15:49.073 --> 15:51.158
Ms. Delvey, the answer is still no.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.243
This is not the way to do business

15:53.327 --> 15:56.455
and the fact that
you don't realize that is also a problem.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.125
-Mr. Reed-- I--
-It's a no. Goodbye, Ms. Delvey.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.897
Anna Delvey approached you
for a $40 million loan?

16:21.981 --> 16:22.856
She did.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.400
We have an excellent track record

16:24.483 --> 16:26.694
and many high-net-worth individuals
come to us first.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.155
If Anna had $60 million
in her trust fund, as she alleged,

16:30.239 --> 16:31.699
why did she even need a loan?

16:31.782 --> 16:32.950
Didn't strike you as weird?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.370
Rich people don't risk their own money.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.873
That's where banks come in. We assume
the risk and we shield their capital.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.543
If all goes well, the banks make money
and they make money.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.753
In any case,
Anna's assets were all in Germany

16:44.837 --> 16:48.215
so she needed a line of credit here
to start the ball rolling on ADF.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.134
But you turned down her loan application?

16:50.217 --> 16:51.927
Most people around town did.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.180
-This is Wall Street.
-Meaning?

16:55.764 --> 16:58.267
This girl wanted to borrow $40 million,

16:58.350 --> 17:01.645
but was swanning around in baby doll
dresses with her boobs hanging out.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.981
-No one took her seriously.
-To lend money to? No.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.776
Some of these sleazebags would shag her,
sure, but she didn't look the part.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.486
This isn't SoHo or the East Village.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.947
She wasn't trying to get a table
at the hot new restaurant.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.408
Anna wanted to borrow a lot of money

17:14.491 --> 17:17.786
from some of the most conservative
institutions in the country.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.206
She needed an in.
She needed to get her bona fides in order.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.624
How did she do that?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.001
Well, she's a smart girl.

17:24.084 --> 17:27.880
She started to dress the part, for one,
but it's more than that.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.967
Do you know how money flows
and circulates amongst the rich?

17:32.801 --> 17:35.179
Relationships and introductions.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.514
Anna needed a sponsor.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.628
Ms. Delvey, what are you doing here?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.631
Your assistant is taking
a very long lunch,

18:10.714 --> 18:12.591
and I got bored waiting in reception.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.676
Your daughter's pretty.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.347
I should call security.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.601
You know how hard it is
for a young woman in business?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.061
How is that relevant?

18:24.561 --> 18:25.896
I have a vision.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.023
I have a sizable trust fund.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.360
I have an incredible advisory board

18:31.443 --> 18:35.531
and yet no one will consider my
business proposal because of how I look.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.491
Think about that for a minute.

18:37.574 --> 18:41.995
If I were a man
with the right accent, in the right suit,

18:42.079 --> 18:44.414
from the right Ivy League college,

18:44.498 --> 18:46.458
would I still be knocking on doors?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.254
Think about what your daughter will face
when she's going out into the world.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.551
Okay.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.594
I'm listening.

19:00.180 --> 19:04.977
Here's my business plan,
which includes renovation timeframes,

19:05.060 --> 19:10.607
operating profits, key performance
indicators and other key metrics.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.401
Mm-hmm.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.112
Go on.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.157
I need your help
to secure the finance for ADF.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.618
With your capital abroad,
it's an uphill battle.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.662
But if anyone can make it happen,
it's you.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.580
Hmm.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.749
My family's business
is handled by Peter Hennecke.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.879
He's based in Germany, but he will
provide you any information you need.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.131
I will wire you a retainer right away.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.299
What do you need?

19:36.091 --> 19:40.179
Well, I've got to confirm capital,
the particulars of your trust.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.183
I'll talk to Peter
and I'll get him to call you today.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.351
Let's start the process.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.812
It's gonna take a lot of legwork.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.105
I have to be sure.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.737
I'm having a party tonight.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.364
Many of my advisors will be there.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.161
Come. Please.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.871
Come to my party and see what I can do.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.456
I can't.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.877
You want to know how viable ADF is?

20:12.544 --> 20:13.378
Then come.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.896
Can we change this?
No one wants smudged silverware.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.358
Alan! Hi.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.859
I'm the first to arrive?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.361
This looks like a nice place.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.196
Of course it's nice. I chose it.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.281
Are you okay?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.202
ADF is everything to me.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.496
Your family must be very proud
of what you're doing.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.956
They don't care.

20:49.039 --> 20:52.084
My dad's always been
so uninterested, so indifferent.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.461
Maybe if I was a boy, he'd be proud.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.965
Reggie! Hi.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.217
You know Reggie Walsh?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.386
Alan. Yeah, we met
in the lobby at Ellis Reed.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.554
Yes, I talked to so many great people.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.931
You guys have the best clients.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.809
-Well, she's not our--
-Oh, Alan, come and meet Michael.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.189
I'm so over Koons.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.400
The work is so derivative these days.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.235
The scope of the project is mind-blowing.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.071
I mean, Anna is
an architect's dream. Incredible.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.324
They approached us to do
some <i>American Idol</i> for artists thing.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.744
Along with my philanthropic arm,
I have a team of AI specialists

21:27.828 --> 21:31.915
because I'm excited by how
art and technology could converge.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.709
What will that intersection create?

21:33.792 --> 21:35.085
That sounds awesome.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.297
We experimented
with freestanding installations

21:38.380 --> 21:41.049
and more conceptual stuff for a few years.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.592
But we're going back to our roots.

21:43.135 --> 21:47.264
This one was inspired
by the Omo Tribes of Southern Ethiopia.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.684
Our bodies are as much a canvas
as the cotton hemp kind.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.270
We went on safari in Kenya once.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.855
Magical place.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.941
Giraffes are bigger than you expect.

21:59.651 --> 22:03.238
At Fortress, I can guarantee that
you'll get a personal hands-on service.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.074
Relationships are how we
do business at City National.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.244
We don't leave you on hold
or force you to use apps.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.538
You guys don't even
have an app yet, do you?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.582
-Well--
-Sometimes an app is convenient.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.750
I love my Uber.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.127
Do you like art, Alan?

22:17.210 --> 22:20.047
Well, I'm more appreciative
than knowledgeable.

22:20.130 --> 22:24.593
I almost got a tattoo of Michelangelo's
<i>Vitruvian Man</i> one summer in Europe,

22:24.676 --> 22:27.262
but something stopped me.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.473
We'd like to paint you.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.682
No. I'm sure you wouldn't--

22:30.766 --> 22:32.017
You don't see what we do.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.226
Which is?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.437
Your spirit shines through, Alan.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.022
Are you scaring Anna's lawyer?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.857
Trying to
get him to sit for us.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.400
They don't just ask anyone.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.194
-Think about it.
-Hmm.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.696
-Anna, you should meet these guys.
-Yeah.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.990
My man Yakub is at Citibank.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.992
-Oh. Hi. Hello.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.953
And this is Ron Wheaton.
CEO of a private jet service.

22:52.037 --> 22:52.996
-Hi.
-Yes.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.165
He worked with us at Fortress
to start up Blade.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.666
-Blade.
-Oh.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.336
This dude here, my man Kevin,
works with Martin Shkreli.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.088
-How are you?
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.798
This is Anna Delvey, you know that.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.008
Thank you for coming.
This means a lot to me.

23:10.639 --> 23:16.269
Thank you all for being here
to support the Anna Delvey Foundation.

23:16.353 --> 23:22.275
When I came up with the idea, I knew
the only place to bring it was New York.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.570
And tonight,
you proved I made the right choice.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.906
Cheers.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.366
Cheers!

23:29.991 --> 23:30.826
Thank you.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.538
This could be a sweet deal for us.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.457
She is really very special.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.251
She really is.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.550
Mr. Hennecke, I appreciate
you talking to me so late,

23:46.633 --> 23:48.176
especially with the time difference.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.011
<i>Not at all. It's my pleasure.</i>

23:50.095 --> 23:52.931
<i>Anna tells me you're the man</i>
<i>to help her secure the building.</i>

23:53.014 --> 23:57.602
Well, I'm going to try, but first I need
some information about Anna's trust.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.522
For purposes of her loan applications

24:00.605 --> 24:03.150
and for our own due diligence
here at Ellis Reed.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.526
<i>That won't be a problem.</i>

24:04.609 --> 24:08.697
<i>As of close of markets today,</i>
<i>the assets are approximately €60 million,</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:11.408
<i>so about $65 million,</i>

24:11.491 --> 24:14.161
<i>but I'll have a copy</i>
<i>of the deed of trust and beneficiaries,</i>

24:14.244 --> 24:18.415
<i>a statement of assets and holdings,</i>
<i>proof of funds, and a list of trustees.</i>

24:19.040 --> 24:20.959
That's exactly what I need. Thank you.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.545
<i>It will be there by tomorrow.</i>
<i>Good night, Mr. Reed.</i>

24:23.628 --> 24:24.463
Good night.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.526
-What?
-Got to be kidding.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.029
-What's going on?
-Okay.

24:49.613 --> 24:53.325
There's a form that gets filled out
for every new client in a place like this.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.660
Like a verification form. Approval.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.246
And there's always a box to be checked.

24:58.330 --> 25:02.334
Does the client have the means and assets,
the money, to pay for services?

25:02.417 --> 25:05.795
Basically, is this person
rich enough to be our client?

25:05.879 --> 25:09.007
The attorney checks a box, yes or no.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.842
Alan Reed checked yes.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.135
What?

25:14.429 --> 25:15.388
What?

25:16.515 --> 25:19.184
But Anna didn't have any means or assets.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.897
I mean, she was crashing
on Billy McFarland's sofa. She was broke.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.107
Alan Reed thought otherwise.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.610
But he's a senior equity partner.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.487
The guy lived through the '80s.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.908
He's seen it all.
Belfort, Trump, Lehman's, Madoff,

25:34.991 --> 25:37.577
and yet, he fell for Anna's bullshit?

25:38.119 --> 25:40.205
How in the hell does that happen?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.082
What is it about Anna?

26:20.954 --> 26:24.624
Sherry, where's that shirt
your sister gave me last Christmas?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.001
I gave it to Goodwill.

26:26.084 --> 26:30.422
You said only Europeans or new money
would wear silk in those colors.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.427
Remember when
we first moved in to the city?

26:35.969 --> 26:40.807
In that walk-up on Christopher Street,
with the pet store downstairs?

26:40.890 --> 26:41.891
How could I forget?

26:42.475 --> 26:44.436
Don't you miss the energy we had?

26:45.353 --> 26:49.107
Excitement about the future,
being away from your parents,

26:49.190 --> 26:51.943
not having everything
mapped out and decided.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.779
I remember how much you hated it.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.742
How you complained every night.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.297
Maybe if you were laying down…

27:12.380 --> 27:15.675
When I lay down,
she climbs to the top of my organs

27:15.759 --> 27:18.637
and takes the little machete
I apparently grew for her

27:18.720 --> 27:20.930
and starts hacking away
at my will to live.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.308
You mean she kicks?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.893
Fuck you and your sperm.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.773
No. You don't have to get up.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.233
Go back to sleep. I'm sorry. I--

27:32.317 --> 27:35.987
No. I do not want to rest
if you are not feeling good.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.490
-Also, I'm afraid if I sleep,

27:38.573 --> 27:41.201
you'll try and kill me
to make sure this is our last child.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.578
-Let's try on all fours again.
-Mm.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.923
Do you think they were fucking?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.550
Alan and Anna?

27:57.634 --> 28:00.053
Alan gives Anna the keys to the kingdom.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.764
An all-access pass.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.350
Why? He thought she had potential?

28:05.433 --> 28:06.893
They don't care about potential.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.145
They care about money.
But Anna didn't have any.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.313
They could've been fucking.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.649
-Older guy, younger girl.
-Mid-life crisis.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.901
It makes so much more sense
if they were fucking.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.236
It happens all the time.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.779
But they weren't fucking.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.280
There'd be receipts.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.910
Credit card bills, hotels,
a secret apartment, gifts. Something.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.037
I've checked. Nothing.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.789
Anna didn't date anyone after Chase.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.166
Anna's the Virgin Mary of Wall Street.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.668
This is not helping.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.504
Wanna try something else?

28:34.587 --> 28:37.173
Could we try jamming the baby
up your holes?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.299
And good night.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.019
-Who're you calling at 3:00 a.m.?

28:50.103 --> 28:53.273
Peter Hennecke.
And it's morning in Düsseldorf.

28:53.356 --> 28:54.190
Baby.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.401
Anna says Hennecke
runs her family's office.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.902
The family's private money manager.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.992
Always goes to voicemail.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.750
You sure they weren't fucking?

29:16.254 --> 29:18.923
Alan? Having an affair?

29:20.425 --> 29:21.259
Oh.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.512
I'm sorry, but, mm-mm, no,
you'd have to know Alan.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.682
He doesn't color outside the lines. Ever.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.059
If it wasn't
an inappropriate relationship,

29:30.143 --> 29:32.228
how do you think Anna fooled Alan?

29:33.104 --> 29:36.316
With lawyers, it's all about
origination credit and billable hours.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.152
The origination credit goes
to the partner who brings the client in.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.989
For an equity partner, like Alan,
that's money in perpetuity.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.200
Even if the client spawns decades of work.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.202
Should vetting be more thorough?
Of course.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.370
But sometimes, a big fish swims by,

29:49.454 --> 29:52.248
you don't waste time
deciding if it's a marl or a carp.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.000
You just cast a net and reel it in.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.504
<i>I'm guessing Alan was thinking,</i>
<i>"If this girl starts the next Soho House,</i>

29:57.587 --> 30:00.340
<i>projecting into the future,</i>
<i>that's millions,</i>

30:00.423 --> 30:02.509
<i>maybe tens of millions, in revenue."</i>

30:02.592 --> 30:04.928
And this was no charity
or hardship for him.

30:05.011 --> 30:09.682
<i>Everything he did for her,</i>
<i>every introduction, every conversation,</i>

30:09.766 --> 30:12.101
<i>every email,</i>
<i>every passing thought about ADF,</i>

30:12.185 --> 30:13.978
these are all billable hours.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.897
Alan was making bank.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.692
A partner of his level,
that's probably $2,000 per hour.

30:19.776 --> 30:23.822
<i>Not including any junior lawyers</i>
<i>or paralegals working on her case for him.</i>

30:24.405 --> 30:25.990
So this was all about money?

30:26.574 --> 30:28.159
For Alan? Hell yeah.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.577
But she never paid them.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.621
Well, that's the real mystery.

30:31.704 --> 30:36.084
How does a partner do more than 200 hours
of work without a retainer in place?

30:37.377 --> 30:40.046
Maybe he lost his touch. It happens.

30:45.051 --> 30:45.885
Oh, my God.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.975
I actually don't need to be here,
but I can't walk another minute

30:52.058 --> 30:53.685
and I needed to pee, so…

30:57.522 --> 31:00.608
I spent all day
talking about billable hours.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.069
Lawyers are all about billable hours.

31:03.611 --> 31:07.282
But as far as I can tell,
Anna never paid Alan a dime.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.033
-Did she?
-No comment.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.202
He helped her for no money.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.329
What is it with this woman?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.623
Are you religious? Is it, is it kindness?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.208
Is there some oath?

31:18.293 --> 31:19.419
You okay?

31:19.502 --> 31:21.504
Yeah. We're not talking about me.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.465
Why would he help her?

31:25.508 --> 31:29.637
Okay, maybe it's the possibility.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.222
The thrill of the hunt.

31:31.306 --> 31:35.268
The chance to cross the finish line first,
the view, the win,

31:35.351 --> 31:38.229
the respect, the honor, the glory.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.148
You know?

31:41.190 --> 31:42.775
So she's not paying you either?

31:43.860 --> 31:44.903
No comment.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.243
The offers
will come flooding in now.

31:52.327 --> 31:56.122
I'm so impatient.
I can't wait to get started.

31:56.205 --> 31:58.541
Everything I've been working for
is right here.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.084
Touching distance.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.211
It'll happen. I believe it.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.673
Your daughter's lucky to have you.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.967
I'm not sure she'd agree with you.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.302
Do you see her a lot?

32:09.385 --> 32:10.720
She's always busy.

32:10.803 --> 32:11.763
At school?

32:11.846 --> 32:14.098
No. College wasn't for her.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.726
She doesn't really do anything.

32:17.810 --> 32:21.272
She gets upset when we ask her
what she wants to do with her life.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.275
We work so hard to give her everything.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.528
To open every door for her.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.867
My dad cut me off once.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.037
-Did I tell you that?
-No.

32:36.746 --> 32:37.705
Hmm.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.582
I was so mad with him.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.877
But after he did that to me,
I had no choice.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.671
I had to stand on my own feet.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.092
After that, I knew
I could take care of myself.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.386
No matter what, I'd be fine.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.099
This one. Do you see?

32:58.142 --> 33:00.687
I do.

33:05.942 --> 33:06.776
Perfect.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.673
What's wrong?

33:28.756 --> 33:31.092
Nothing. Just saying good morning.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.441
<i>I have Peter Hennecke</i>
<i>on the phone, regarding Anna Delvey.</i>

33:46.524 --> 33:47.525
Put him through.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.819
Good to speak again, Mr. Hennecke.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.864
<i>Anna tells me</i>
<i>you're making progress in New York.</i>

33:52.947 --> 33:57.035
We have two banks very interested in her
proposition and in loaning her the money.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.286
<i>Excellent news.</i>

33:58.369 --> 34:01.873
<i>I presume you'll need paperwork</i>
<i>regarding her trust, proof of funds…</i>

34:01.956 --> 34:06.169
Exactly that. Proof of the trust,
and its origins, bank statements.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.297
My assistant will email you
a whole checklist of what we need.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.382
<i>That would be helpful.</i>
<i>Thank you, Mr. Reed.</i>

34:11.466 --> 34:12.925
Alan, please.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.803
It's an incredible project.
All credit must go to Anna.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.597
<i>She always was a gifted girl.</i>

34:17.680 --> 34:18.639
I'm sure.

34:18.723 --> 34:22.477
I'll also have my assistant
send our invoice again, for our retainer.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.187
<i>Of course. My apologies.</i>

34:24.270 --> 34:26.397
<i>I will send a wire transfer immediately.</i>

34:26.481 --> 34:28.649
<i>It may take maybe two, maybe three days.</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:31.152
I understand. International wires can be--

34:31.235 --> 34:33.654
<i>Such an irritation,</i>
<i>but it will be promptly sent.</i>

34:33.738 --> 34:36.074
<i>You have my full attention now,</i>
<i>whatever you need.</i>

34:36.157 --> 34:37.075
Thank you, Peter.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.217
Are you sure it's here?
It doesn't feel safe.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.344
Nobody gets mugged in New York anymore.

34:56.928 --> 34:57.970
Come on.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.641
This chef has an incredible reputation
for her food trucks.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.726
Food trucks?
I don't believe this.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.854
Uh-huh. She got written up in
<i>The New York Times.</i> Anna says she's cool.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.023
Anna says. I'm not going in there.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.317
Come on. This is how it works.

35:30.711 --> 35:31.879
Wow.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.424
Mom! Dad!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.636
The retreat is supposed to be amazing.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.096
Kylie was there just last week.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.808
New glasses, Dad?

35:43.891 --> 35:46.686
Progressives. The frames
are a little young.

35:46.769 --> 35:49.438
You let a hipster
help you choose your glasses.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.232
-I like them.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.525
They look good on you.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.485
So your mom and I were talking…

35:54.569 --> 35:57.572
Since it didn't work out
with the French cooking course--

35:57.655 --> 35:58.781
That wasn't my fault.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.950
No one's saying it was, but what's next?

36:01.659 --> 36:04.287
Robert Taylor's daughter
is an editor at Condé Nast.

36:04.370 --> 36:05.746
She said you can give her a call.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.166
God! No. Journalism is dead.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.208
I'm not doing that.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.460
Than what do you want to do?

36:11.544 --> 36:13.629
You're being very confrontational.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.464
Dad and I are worried.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.217
Your gap year has been going on
for two and a half years.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.927
Your friends are graduating next year.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.846
I'm on my own path.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.389
And where's that path going?

36:24.599 --> 36:26.809
I'm sorry, Julia.
I didn't mean to upset you.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.810
We're just worried.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.437
I'm doing my best.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.232
We know you're trying,
but you have to try harder.

36:33.816 --> 36:34.650
Mom!

36:34.734 --> 36:37.778
It's time you start taking responsibility
for your actions.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.946
What does that mean?

36:39.030 --> 36:43.492
That means if you can't hold down a job,
or commit to study or school,

36:43.576 --> 36:45.077
then we can't keep supporting you.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.580
I'm trying to discover my passions.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.875
Not everyone can have
a boring, stable job.

36:50.958 --> 36:55.463
That's true, but my boring, stable job
can't keep bankrolling you doing nothing.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.758
People work at their passions, Julia.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.426
It's time for you to do something.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.720
You're cutting me off?

37:23.491 --> 37:26.035
Oh, my God. Oh. Alan.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.995
Alan.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.840
That was amazing.

37:39.924 --> 37:40.841
It was, wasn't it?

37:49.225 --> 37:50.393
You close the deal?

37:51.018 --> 37:51.894
Almost.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.437
Ah, sweet!

37:53.521 --> 37:56.649
Look at you with your boss moves,
leaning in and shit.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.860
-How's your party?
-Ah.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.196
That's like calling
the Last Supper a dinner.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.033
What I'm creating is a game-changing
experience. It's like the Moon landing.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.994
So how's your Moon landing?

38:08.077 --> 38:09.328
We're killing it.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.832
You can't tell anybody,
but watch this space.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.876
We're calling it "Fyre Festival."

38:16.419 --> 38:17.837
Fyre. With a "Y."

38:18.838 --> 38:20.172
Fyre Festival?

38:20.756 --> 38:23.968
Fyre with a "Y"?
That's the name of your thing?

38:24.051 --> 38:27.013
The letter "Y" is rare
and important in numerology.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.348
You're serious?

38:42.611 --> 38:43.863
-Viv?

38:43.946 --> 38:45.489
-You in there?

38:45.573 --> 38:46.574
No.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.075
She stole a fucking jet.

38:49.118 --> 38:49.952
What?

38:50.036 --> 38:53.331
Anna stole a fucking jet!

38:53.414 --> 38:54.457
Explain.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.461
-Wh…

38:58.544 --> 39:01.005
You know this is a ladies room, right?

39:01.088 --> 39:02.381
I was peeing in here.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.259
Gender is an outdated concept,
urine is universal.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.635
Anna stole a fucking jet.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.970
She knows. She knows.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.932
-Did you tell her?
-I'm trying.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.226
We have Blade's witness statements.

39:14.310 --> 39:18.939
Anna chartered a $35,000 private plane
to take her to Omaha.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.316
How did she afford that?

39:20.399 --> 39:21.901
-You didn't tell her?
-No.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.903
Anna stole a fucking jet.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.489
Listen, Anna never paid,
no card, no wire. Nothing.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.408
She actually stole a plane?

39:29.492 --> 39:31.911
Blade is pressing charges,
and working with the DA,

39:31.994 --> 39:33.204
saying she scammed them.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.663
How do you steal a fucking plane?

39:34.747 --> 39:36.916
I can't scam
extra legroom seat from Delta,

39:36.999 --> 39:40.836
but this kid is scamming
a private jet to Omaha. Kudos.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.421
What's in Omaha?

39:43.714 --> 39:44.632
Thank you.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.593
Your loan application
passed the first stage.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.763
We'll move on to due diligence
and get this whole thing wrapped up.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.600
To ADF and Fortress.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.227
To building something special.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.604
I have a good feeling about this.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.690
I'm all about helping you
achieve whatever you want.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.026
Well, I like the sound of that.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.988
What are you doing next weekend?
You want tickets for Berkshire Hathaway?

40:09.698 --> 40:10.950
Warren Buffet's thing?

40:11.784 --> 40:15.204
Warren Buffet. She went to Warren Buffet's
Berkshire Hathaway conference.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.872
Swear to God. I have it in my notes.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.707
I really do like her.

40:19.792 --> 40:23.629
What I want to know is,
how do you steal a fucking plane?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.136
-How's it going?
-And this is Ron Wheaton.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.720
CEO of a private jet service.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.848


40:33.931 --> 40:36.016


40:36.100 --> 40:37.977


40:38.060 --> 40:40.229


40:40.312 --> 40:42.815


40:47.361 --> 40:49.947
-Dude, is that the next iPhone?
-Beta testing, man.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.963
The plane is here,
but she didn't supply a credit card

41:06.046 --> 41:08.048
and the wire transfer hasn't arrived.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.551
You know we can't let
anyone fly without payment.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.969
You read Ron's email?

41:12.052 --> 41:15.556
It says right here, "Assist Ms. Delvey
with the required plane."

41:16.182 --> 41:17.975
The rules are the rules.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.436
She's buddies with the CEO.
He said "assist her."

41:20.519 --> 41:22.563
Do you want to tell the boss's friend
she can't fly?

41:22.646 --> 41:23.731
Oh, shit.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.525
Sweet ride, Anna.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.735
Thanks for bringing us.

41:27.818 --> 41:31.155
Well, it's nothing. You were headed
there anyway. More the merrier.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.699
Ms. Delvey? Ms. Delvey.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.868
-Ms. Delvey!
-What?

41:36.577 --> 41:39.163
I'm sorry, um,
your wire didn't come through.

41:39.246 --> 41:41.248
Check your systems.
The wire has been sent.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.251
-But--
-I have meetings to get to. Talk to Ron.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.922
-You call Ron.
-<i>You</i> call Ron.

41:52.468 --> 41:55.513
So she just took a plane? No cash down.

41:55.596 --> 41:58.557
She was going to Warren Buffet's house.
She had to be good for the money.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.435
I told them to let her fly,
the wire would arrive.

42:02.436 --> 42:05.523
She knew all the right people,
she was in all the right places.

42:05.606 --> 42:08.859
Rich people are careless with money.
I figured she's ditsy, but loaded.

42:08.943 --> 42:13.614
So you'd let me just walk
on to a jet, right now?

42:13.697 --> 42:14.657
Hell no.

42:14.740 --> 42:17.868
I mean, no offense,
but you are clearly a civilian.

42:18.869 --> 42:19.703
Great.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.713
-Ah!
-Ha ha!

42:31.173 --> 42:32.800
You're really moving today.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.677
I feel great.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.722
By the way, thanks for the recommendation.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.140
Anna is a star.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.600
Who?

42:41.684 --> 42:44.603
Anna Delvey, your German heiress.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.146
Opening the members club.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.314
Oh, that worked out?

42:48.107 --> 42:49.733
I thought you knew her family?

42:49.817 --> 42:52.069
Nah. Met her at a party once.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.404
Must have given her my card.

42:53.487 --> 42:54.738
Ah.

42:54.822 --> 42:58.909
Well, we've got Fortress on the hook
for a $40 million loan.

42:58.993 --> 43:03.581
Looking at an annual revenue stream
of upwards of $200 million.

43:04.748 --> 43:08.544
And that is before
the clubs expand globally.

43:08.627 --> 43:11.505
Sweet. You'll be billing
for this thing until you die.

43:12.798 --> 43:14.049
You've got that right.

43:14.133 --> 43:15.217
Don't forget my cut.

43:15.301 --> 43:16.135
Cut?

43:17.052 --> 43:18.262
What cut?

43:19.888 --> 43:22.141
I could get used to this.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.019
When you travel as much as I do,

43:25.102 --> 43:27.271
it's so much more convenient
than commercial.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.649
<i>We are about to begin</i>
<i>our descent into Omaha.</i>

43:30.733 --> 43:32.109
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts.</i>

43:36.363 --> 43:39.074
-We should blow the conference, right?
-Yeah.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.493
The real VIPs aren't here
for the conference.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.829
-We're here for the party.
-One party.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.123
Every year Warren Buffet
throws a secret party.

43:46.206 --> 43:49.168
Only real important people
get invited, like Bill Gates.

43:49.251 --> 43:50.336
It's at the zoo this year.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.338
A zoo?

43:53.380 --> 43:54.381
I like a party.

43:55.966 --> 43:59.178
So you're attaching
criminal intent to this trip.

43:59.261 --> 44:00.387
She's a businesswoman.

44:00.471 --> 44:04.308
Her loan application was in with Fortress
and City National Bank.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.352
She was waiting for the money
to come through.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.687
So Berkshire Hathaway
was just a pre-celebration?

44:08.771 --> 44:11.940
Yeah. Uh, who celebrates in Omaha?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.610
You know, when I was 25,
my idea of fun was Vegas, Miami.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.611
But you're not Anna.

44:15.694 --> 44:19.198
This rich people money festival
is like banker heaven.

44:19.281 --> 44:23.786
Savvy, collective, exclusive.
This is Warren Buffet's annual Coachella.

44:23.869 --> 44:27.790
She steals a plane to hang out
with the richest men in the world?

44:27.873 --> 44:30.417
-Allegedly. Maybe she had the funds.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.129
Alan believed she did. That's why
he was working his contacts for ADF.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.215
Fortress was ready to bite.

44:36.298 --> 44:38.550
Calatrava was doing
the architectural plans…

44:38.634 --> 44:40.302
Keep talking, just look over there.

44:40.386 --> 44:44.807
All she needed was one last step,
and that deal would have closed.

44:44.890 --> 44:46.642
-Jeez.

44:46.725 --> 44:48.644
Okay, don't move.

44:48.727 --> 44:51.146
I've done this before. Just hold still.

44:51.230 --> 44:52.981
What are you doing?

44:56.860 --> 44:57.903
Jesus!

44:59.863 --> 45:01.240
Better?

45:02.783 --> 45:04.952
The pain is gone. It's actually gone.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.495
I love you.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.414
Nine years of marriage, two kids.

45:23.262 --> 45:24.096
Passes.

45:29.143 --> 45:30.227
Thank you.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.566
You don't have access to this event.

45:35.649 --> 45:36.859
But I have a ticket.

45:36.942 --> 45:38.902
That's a conference ticket only.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.488
You don't have
the credentials for this event.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.865
But my name will be on the list.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.366
No list, just the right pass.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.868
-Want to catch up with us?

45:45.951 --> 45:47.995
Uh, sure, let me just fix this.
I'll see you there.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.288
Scan it again.

45:51.165 --> 45:52.416
Do you know who I am?

45:52.499 --> 45:54.042
Ma'am, could you step aside?

45:56.253 --> 45:57.337
Hi. Um…

45:57.421 --> 45:58.714
-Uh…

45:58.797 --> 45:59.715
One second.

46:01.633 --> 46:02.760
Yes?

46:02.843 --> 46:04.094
<i>Anna, how's it going?</i>

46:05.554 --> 46:06.889
David, what is it?

46:06.972 --> 46:09.641
Good news. Your loan application
is with the underwriters.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.143
We're through to the next step.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.645
They've asked for
a good faith deposit of 100K

46:13.729 --> 46:15.814
<i>just to proceed with the due diligence.</i>

46:15.898 --> 46:17.357
<i>That won't be an issue for you?</i>

46:18.025 --> 46:19.860
No. Of course not.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.321
Uh, I'll have Peter wire that right away.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.454
-Anna, there's no need to panic.
-<i>I'm going to lose 281 Park.</i>

46:30.537 --> 46:32.915
They're already getting impatient.

46:32.998 --> 46:36.293
I don't have 100K in the US right now.

46:36.376 --> 46:37.961
<i>All my money is stuck in Europe.</i>

46:38.045 --> 46:40.130
<i>-I can't lose my building.</i>
-Anna, calm down.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.049
We still have City National Bank.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.760
Let's park Fortress for now.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.929
Reggie at CNB will come through
for you with the loan

46:47.012 --> 46:48.972
<i>and you'll be able to secure that lease.</i>

46:50.307 --> 46:53.602
I want you to work with me.
We're a good team.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.021
You could be on my board at ADF.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.066
Thank you, Anna. It means a lot.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.692
<i>No. Don't thank me.</i>

47:00.776 --> 47:02.986
Just say yes, and help me fix this.

47:03.070 --> 47:03.987
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

47:19.211 --> 47:20.879
Ms. Delvey, I was about to call you.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.548
What's taking so long? It's been weeks.

47:22.631 --> 47:24.174
We tried completing our due diligence.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.593
We reached out to UBS in Munich
and Peter Hennecke--

47:26.677 --> 47:29.096
He sent you everything.
I was copied on those emails.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.890
Yes, but some of those documents
were a little vague.

47:31.974 --> 47:32.850
Uh…

47:32.933 --> 47:36.353
I'm sorry, my underwriters couldn't
be convinced. They kept pushing back.

47:36.436 --> 47:40.148
They, uh, they declined to proceed
with your loan application.

47:40.983 --> 47:44.361
You said they'd come through, Alan.
You said Reggie would help me out.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.488
-There are other options.
-No, there aren't!

47:46.572 --> 47:47.948
I want that building.

47:48.031 --> 47:51.869
I told you, I want 281 Park.
It can only be 281 Park!

47:51.952 --> 47:53.662
Anna, you have to calm down.

47:53.745 --> 47:56.123
No. They're going to give
my building to someone else.

47:56.206 --> 47:57.541
They're trying to make me fail.

47:57.624 --> 47:59.543
No one wants you to fail.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.837
I thought
you were on my side, Alan.

48:01.920 --> 48:02.754
I am.

48:12.264 --> 48:13.724
We're in this together.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.852
What am I going to do?

48:18.312 --> 48:19.938
What am I going to do, Alan?

48:20.606 --> 48:23.650
My father…
My father will think I'm useless.

48:26.361 --> 48:29.740
If I'm going to be on your board,
you have to trust me.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.285
I will talk to Reggie.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.329
Go home.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.205
-I'll handle this, okay?

48:40.876 --> 48:42.461
Okay.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.973
You're the only one I can trust.

48:57.726 --> 49:01.313
Peter, can you guarantee me
that that money is coming in?

49:01.396 --> 49:03.732
That Anna's wire transfer will arrive?

49:03.815 --> 49:06.443
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>What are you suggesting?</i>

49:06.526 --> 49:08.862
<i>The transfer has already gone through.</i>

49:08.946 --> 49:10.197
<i>What's wrong, Alan?</i>

49:11.114 --> 49:12.366
<i>I had no choice.</i>

49:12.449 --> 49:14.159
The underwriters pushed back hard.

49:14.242 --> 49:17.204
We couldn't satisfactorily account
for the origin of her wealth.

49:17.287 --> 49:18.664
Who is this girl?

49:18.747 --> 49:19.915
Are you sure about her?

49:23.001 --> 49:24.628
Reggie, this is disappointing.

49:25.170 --> 49:27.214
I can assure you
there is significant wealth there.

49:27.297 --> 49:29.049
Why else would I agree to be on her board?

49:29.633 --> 49:30.550
My hands are tied.

49:33.553 --> 49:34.930
I shouldn't be telling you this,

49:35.013 --> 49:39.643
but David at Fortress has already started
due diligence and will approve.

49:39.726 --> 49:42.729
ADF has added André Balazs
and other big names.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.440
She's going to have backing
to float within five years.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.235
What can I do to make this right?

49:51.697 --> 49:53.281
As a show of good faith,

49:53.365 --> 49:56.118
I'd like to open an account for you
at City National Bank.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.912
Given your activities in the US,

49:59.454 --> 50:03.333
we'd like to extend an immediate
overdraft facility of $200,000.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.794
You could withdraw that money right away.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.509
I… I want you to understand
that we value your business

50:12.592 --> 50:15.345
and I'll personally ensure
you have everything you need.

50:16.179 --> 50:18.306
I want to mend our relationship.

50:19.808 --> 50:21.351
I'm glad to hear it.

50:23.812 --> 50:28.775
If you'll sign here, we'll deposit
the $200,000 in your account immediately.

50:32.070 --> 50:32.904
Guys!

50:33.822 --> 50:34.865
Get over here.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.622
Hmm.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.249
I went through her credit card bills.

50:44.332 --> 50:47.335
Our girl made several purchases
from Telefonica.

50:47.419 --> 50:48.295
What's that?

50:48.879 --> 50:50.255
A phone operator in Europe.

50:50.338 --> 50:53.842
Anna spent $100 on a virtual SIM card.

50:53.925 --> 50:56.845
A SIM card is that little chip thing

50:56.928 --> 50:58.930
in your phone
that stores your information--

50:59.014 --> 51:00.891
-I know what a SIM card is.
-Good.

51:00.974 --> 51:03.894
Well, now there are virtual SIM cards.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.064
So you can have
a virtual SIM app on your phone,

51:07.147 --> 51:09.483
that lets you run phone numbers
for different countries.

51:09.566 --> 51:11.485
-Anna had one of these?
-She did.

51:11.568 --> 51:13.028
What number was she running?

51:13.111 --> 51:15.363
Now we get to the good part.

51:25.665 --> 51:26.875
Mr. Reed?

51:28.085 --> 51:30.504
Ms. Kent, this is bordering on harassment.

51:30.587 --> 51:33.006
Did you know about Peter Hennecke?
Did you know?

51:34.758 --> 51:36.551
Good to speak again, Mr. Hennecke.

51:36.635 --> 51:39.221
<i>Anna tells me</i>
<i>you're making progress in New York.</i>

51:39.304 --> 51:43.767
We have two banks very interested in her
proposition and in loaning her the money.

51:43.850 --> 51:45.268
Excellent news.

51:45.352 --> 51:49.397
I presume you'll need paperwork
regarding her trust, proof of funds…

51:50.857 --> 51:54.236
I had conversations with Hennecke.
I spoke with the man.

51:54.820 --> 51:59.699
She bought a virtual SIM to run a German
number and used a voice distorter app.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.035
Five dollars on iTunes.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.954
There never was a Peter Hennecke.

52:06.748 --> 52:08.917
-<i>What's her name?</i>
-<i>Anna Delvey.</i>

52:09.626 --> 52:11.753
<i>Who is this girl?</i>
<i>Are you sure about her?</i>

52:11.837 --> 52:13.588
<i>This could be a sweet deal for us.</i>

52:13.672 --> 52:15.715
I can assure you
there is significant wealth there.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.759
Why else would I agree to be on her board?

52:17.843 --> 52:19.344
I shouldn't be telling you this,

52:19.427 --> 52:24.057
but David at Fortress has already started
due diligence and will approve.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.768
She is really very special.

52:27.477 --> 52:28.436
She really is.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.821
-Alan?

52:37.904 --> 52:39.823
<i>How can you justify doing that?</i>

52:39.906 --> 52:42.701
Hennecke, lying to Alan…

52:42.784 --> 52:44.286
You and your stories.

52:44.828 --> 52:46.163
You're saying I'm wrong?

52:49.374 --> 52:53.170
I think my father only ever wanted sons.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.506
My brother is the genius.

52:57.382 --> 53:01.178
I think my dad always expected me to fail.

53:03.263 --> 53:05.682
All men underestimate women.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.476
Even the one who's supposed to love us.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.395
Did Alan underestimate you?

53:11.146 --> 53:12.564
Is that why you humiliated him?

53:12.647 --> 53:14.900
You're so worried about Alan.

53:14.983 --> 53:18.945
Do you seriously think
he's in any danger of losing anything?

53:19.487 --> 53:22.616
I'm the one locked up
for crimes I didn't commit.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.242
I'm the one denied bail.

53:24.326 --> 53:28.413
Every day men do far worse things
than anything I've allegedly done.

53:28.496 --> 53:30.916
And what happens to them? Nothing.

53:30.999 --> 53:34.377
No consequences, no fallout,
and definitely no jail time.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.922
Alan will be fine.
They'll probably promote him.

53:37.005 --> 53:39.341
Men fail upwards all the time.

53:41.927 --> 53:44.012
Right there. Good.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.394
<i>An economic miracle</i>
<i>is taking place…</i>

53:51.478 --> 53:53.188
-Oh, that's perfect.

53:53.271 --> 53:55.523
You're not gonna leave me
for Todd, are you?

53:56.650 --> 53:59.319
<i>…the world has seen</i>
<i>what we always knew…</i>

53:59.402 --> 54:01.029
-We'll see.
<i>-…that no people on Earth</i>

54:01.112 --> 54:05.784
<i>are so fearless, or daring,</i>
<i>or determined as Americans.</i>

54:07.244 --> 54:08.954
Uh, uh, uh.

54:09.579 --> 54:10.830
What a shit show.

54:11.873 --> 54:15.460
So you gonna get sued by Ellis Reed?
Because we can't afford bail money.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.130
I spoke to him.

54:21.007 --> 54:24.219
Alan Reed was just a patsy. Anna used him.

54:24.302 --> 54:25.178
Poor fool.

54:25.262 --> 54:28.056
Whatever Alan is, he is not poor.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.100
They basically promoted him.

54:30.642 --> 54:33.144
Appointed him global head
of the real estate division.

54:33.228 --> 54:36.022
$2 million a year
before bonuses and equity share.

54:36.106 --> 54:40.110
He allowed his firm to be defrauded
and they promoted him.

54:41.611 --> 54:43.905
<i>…because our people are strong.</i>

54:45.448 --> 54:47.450
There's zero consequences for these men.

54:58.211 --> 54:59.754
Good morning, Mr. Reed.

55:00.922 --> 55:03.550
I have Court 12 open for you.
