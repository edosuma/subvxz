00:08.801 --> 00:10.385
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.511 --> 00:14.639
Does anyone know what gets
Michelle Obama out of bed in the morning?

00:14.723 --> 00:15.723
Fat kids!

00:15.974 --> 00:17.767
-Kevin told me everything.
-What did he tell you?

00:17.893 --> 00:21.062
He told me that he and that snotty doctor
you work with did an intervention on you.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.731
-You're not still mad at me, are you?
-God, no.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.150
l can't stand
when you take me off the shelf like this.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.778
You throw me this crumb and l'm hooked.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.322
Aunt Tunie is going to stay with us
for a couple of weeks.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.825
-Weeks?
-You're good with that, right?

00:33.909 --> 00:34.992
l saw your friend Eddie at work today.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.078
-Thanks again.
-Yeah.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.747
Eddie, that's the one you want me
to go out with, right?

00:40.082 --> 00:42.333
Just a thought. The last one broke his heart.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.235
-Grace is good.
-Has Fiona charmed every last nun?

02:32.319 --> 02:35.071
Yes, she would sleep in that uniform
if l let her.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.199
We already have Kevin's sister passing out
in her clothes at the house.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.450
-She's staying with you?
-Yeah.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.828
l think Kevin installed her
to keep an eye on me.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.287
-Really.
-Yeah.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.041
l wish she was a little more cop,
a little less drunken teenage stepdaughter.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.125
lt'd be a little easier.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.212
Speaking of authority figures,

02:51.296 --> 02:55.216
Akalitus has offered me chief of the ER.
ln title only.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.801
Wow, that sounds nice.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.679
No. Don't do empty titles.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.472
My uncle was an earl. lt ruined him.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.725
-So are you... You still looking?
-No, no.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.229
Hostile patients, terrible hours...
How could l ever leave?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.690
Can l get that in writing?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.859
Do you want me to renegotiate
my contract right now?

03:13.569 --> 03:15.069
Yeah, l do.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.739
Give me that.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.576
Look, l don't want to go back
down the rabbit hole again,

03:21.660 --> 03:25.413
so just promise me next time
you go on the attack, take better aim.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.665
l hear you.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.250
Really? Really?

03:31.253 --> 03:33.337
Excuse me, how do you fuck up
a chicken Caesar?

03:33.505 --> 03:34.881
lt's not a rhetorical question, cupcake.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.465
-Tell me.
-Leave it alone.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.302
-l'm sorry. l can just take it back.
-Do you see any chicken?

03:40.554 --> 03:43.222
Why don't you go get your manager
before l lose my shit?

03:43.932 --> 03:45.099
You want another beer or something?

03:47.019 --> 03:49.020
Hi. You wanted to see the manager?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.521
Why are you wearing a nurse's uniform?

03:50.606 --> 03:51.898
l moonlight. What's the problem?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.483
-She screwed up my order.
-Yeah, it happens.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.236
-Don't need to be an asshole.
-Excuse me?

03:57.571 --> 04:00.531
-ls he a client?
-Yeah.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.075
You think it's gonna impress him,
berating a 24-year-old waitress?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
ls that how you do business?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.703
You comfortable
doing business with an asshole?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.373
No, actually. My daughter's a waitress.

04:10.667 --> 04:15.796
You might want to apologize.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.676
-l am sorry.
-No, not to him, to her.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.808
l'm sorry.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.645
Get him his chicken, Janine.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.147
l am your manager. He said he was sorry.
Get him his chicken.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.655
Your lunch is on me.
Your friend is awesome.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.493
l have missed you
and the havoc that you wreak.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.916
l had two rabies, one infant fever
and eight suture removals.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.669
-Did l tell you this is my first double?
-Yes, you did.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.588
Do you need to use the bathroom?

04:57.673 --> 04:59.715
No, l have a pedometer now.
Every step counts.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.385
You have walked 5.3 miles.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.346
Look at this.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.641
Bellevue already kicked off a campaign.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.518
All of those kids are fat.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.561
That one looks really sad.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.481
Oh, no, l'm sad.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.483
That ad is good.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.402
March on, Miss Barkow.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.364
-Where did you get that?
-Ripped it off the 6 train.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.450
Wow, Gloria, that's effective.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.828
l'm not handing over
the First Lady visit without a fight.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.373
We've got to get out in front of this.
Fund-raising starts now.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.208
Now?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.544
-l only have five bucks.
-Every little bit helps.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.425
-Hello, chief. How are you doing, chief?
-Would you stop it?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.176
Urine behind you. Urine. Sorry, chief.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.054
Dude, l'm saying it's admirable.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.683
Sorry, l wasn't listening to you.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.269
l was thinking about this shirt l want.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.564
l think l'm gonna buy it.

05:57.733 --> 05:58.733
What?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.985
l'm saying it's admirable
that you're comfortable

06:01.069 --> 06:02.695
with Dr. O'Hara being your superior.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.823
Superior? ln what way?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.534
Seriously? Oh, you didn't hear.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.912
Akalitus named Dr. O'Hara chief of the ER.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.916
No. No, no, no, no.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.918
No. No way.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.046
l would have heard about that.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.215
-Why?
-Because l'm a doctor.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.010
She's a doctor. l would know, okay?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.887
Just like you know all the nursey stuff.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.604
Sorry.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.607
Dude, what's up with the limp?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.108
You want me to grab you a wheelchair?

06:43.236 --> 06:47.198
-Happy first day at work.
-Oh, yeah, big day.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.532
Did you bring me a card or something?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.576
No, l couldn't quite find the right one.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.079
l brought you a helmet for the ride home.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.247
For... For the what?

06:55.707 --> 06:57.249
On the bike to your home.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.295
Kevin invited me over
for a celebratory barbecue.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.215
He gets me a job. He's making me a steak.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.550
You better hope that guy never leaves you.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.803
-Yeah, he's a keeper.
-Yeah.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.890
So l'll... l'll pick you up after your shift.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.226
You were right.
Now that Kevin knows you work here,

07:15.310 --> 07:18.395
-things have gotten so much more normal.
-Yeah.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.983
What l want and expect is your full support

07:23.443 --> 07:25.653
and a list of potential donors.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.113
And if l don't get that,

07:27.197 --> 07:30.616
there will be a bunch of obese children

07:30.826 --> 07:33.160
standing outside your door every day

07:33.245 --> 07:35.246
until l get what l need.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.165
Listen, Sister, you married God,

07:38.416 --> 07:40.167
l married this job!

07:40.752 --> 07:42.837
l'm throwing my hat in the ring. Look out.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.214
-What hat?
-Come on, Gloria.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.301
"Chief of the ER" is not a title
you hand out like a stick of gum.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.846
-Hold.
-l have many qualifications.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.430
One, my gift for tiny stitches.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.725
-Two, popular among the staff.
-You're not.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.813
l've had lunch with almost
everyone who works here.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.107
Popular among the staff.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.235
-Three...
-Dr. Cooper, nothing has been set in stone.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.446
lf you want chief so badly,
show me what you got.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.868
-Like a dance-off?
-Like overtime.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.703
Or a dance-off.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.122
Hi, honey. Barbecue sounds great.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.457
Let me know if you need me
to pick anything up on the way home, okay?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.710
-Love you. Bye.
-My wife is having a fucking baby.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.714
My wife is having a baby.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.215
My wife is having a fucking baby.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.551
Okay, calm down, sir. Maternity's on 6.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.011
No, l know. She's up there.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.475
lt's me. l've been dry heaving for two hours.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.312
See, they can't treat me upstairs
because l'm not a patient,

08:41.396 --> 08:42.938
so they sent me down here.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.566
Oh, God, l'm gonna miss everything.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.736
Okay, you're having chest pains, okay?
That way we can get you in right away.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.362
Chest pains. What's your name?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.240
l'm Ethan Rizansky and l have chest pains.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.825
Follow me.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.494
No, not this shit.
We've been waiting an hour.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.997
My daughter's got asthma.
You got my name on that list?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.999
-Candace De La Brix.
-Where's your daughter?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.751
Right in front of you.
She can barely breathe.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.674
l'm sorry, this man has chest pains.
He goes first. Come on.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.722
The Zofran will take the edge off the nausea.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.807
The Valium drip will take
the edge off everything else.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.435
Can you tell my...

09:23.647 --> 09:27.483
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Yeah. lt's the Valium.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.526
l already called upstairs.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.238
She's still on six centimeters,
so you might want to relax.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.240
This is the easy part.

09:35.450 --> 09:39.453
Two ETs, ten lVs,
four piss runs and a guy aspirated,

09:39.621 --> 09:42.957
also known as vomited, all over me,
so l had to change my scrubs.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.252
-Are you comfortable?
-Yeah.

09:46.962 --> 09:47.962
Are you on speed?

09:48.213 --> 09:51.423
-l am speed, motherfucker!
-Yeah, we're going. Let's go.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.636
You have walked 12,304 steps.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.430
Thank you for bringing me here.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.687
You're gonna have to learn to pace yourself,
Zoey, or you're gonna burn out.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.147
And you will burn out, l promise you.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.649
Yeah.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.485
l forgot how good these are.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.076
Did you get married in a church?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.329
We had a long, hot afternoon mass.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.543
l know that if l get married
l'm going to be a sweaty bride.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.254
l think about that a lot.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.673
lt's not good.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.175
You've got time.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.511
Your pace has slowed.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.596
Sorry.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.016
Really?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.644
Sorry.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.064
-Keep moving.
-Sit down.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.578
l can hear you breathing.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.332
What is that?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.959
lt's a fund-raising thermometer.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.255
You should step back and take a look at it.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.300
Seriously, you don't
want that near your door.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.470
Dear God! What is that?

11:20.263 --> 11:23.098
lt's an old-fashioned thermometer.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.391
l drew it myself.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.102
Looks like an old-fashioned willy.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.812
l tried to tell you.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.525
l don't see it.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.612
Which reminds me,
Dr. Cooper has announced

11:36.696 --> 11:38.906
his intention to compete
for the title of chief.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.824
-Announced to whom?
-Anyone.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.410
How can he compete for a job
you've already offered to me?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.537
He can't if you accept the title.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.416
You're relentless. All right, fine, l accept,

11:50.418 --> 11:52.753
but only so the crown
doesn't fall to Prince John.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.797
He's working overtime to prove himself,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.758
so let's not make it official till next week.

12:01.096 --> 12:05.015
lf l give you $1 ,000,
will you take that picture down?

12:06.142 --> 12:08.977
No, but l will put
your name on it in gold marker.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.438
And another thousand to take my name off.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.196
Lou Babiak, 50, passed out in the lobby
of the Time & Life Building.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.241
Minor head trauma.
Got contusions on his forehead and cheek.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.784
Pulse ox is holding at 90.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.078
He's complaining of blurred vision.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.955
Lobby guard called it in.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.583
My first job interview in months
and l pass out before l get up to HR.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.628
l could have taken a cab here.

12:34.963 --> 12:35.963
l'm way better than a cab.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.133
This guy can drive. l'll tell you what...

12:39.884 --> 12:41.718
l never got out of Midtown that fast.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.220
Yeah, well, the siren helps.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.430
Nice talking to you, man.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.766
Could l get some help here?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.351
l'll take it.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.353
l'll take this.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.567
Hello, where are all the doctors?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.159
Those shoes are hideous.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.494
Did someone steal
your ltalian penny loafers?

13:07.579 --> 13:08.745
No. Hoops.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.790
l trashed my instep driving the lane,
so l had to change up the footwear.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.501
l'm a ferocious competitor,
as you will soon find out.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.254
l'm not sure you can compete for a job

13:17.338 --> 13:19.298
that's actually been
offered to someone else.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.550
-Watch me.
-l am.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.051
lt's terribly sad.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.888
Damn it, your office is bigger.
l can't believe it's bigger.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.931
lf l win chief, l get your office.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.392
-Absolutely. lt only seems fair.
-Right?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.519
l think l'll paint it. Can l sit down?

13:39.569 --> 13:41.028
lt must be a good one.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.197
Come on, l'll race you for it.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.951
Ten-second handicap since you're gimpy.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.587
Hey, dude, listen, l'm in bad shape,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.297
so l'm gonna tag you
and you're gonna run it in.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.466
l have no idea what you're talking about.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.176
Just tell Jackie that you're me.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.386
l answered the page first and l win, okay?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.305
-All right, let me ask you a question.
-Yeah.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.558
ls it presumptuous to bring
special barbecue sauce to a barbecue?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.894
-l always bring dessert.
-Dessert.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.230
Okay, l'm right behind you.

14:22.904 --> 14:27.824
Hey, Coop told me to tell you
l'm him and he got here first.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.078
-Where is he?
-He's on his way. How are you doing?

14:34.165 --> 14:35.958
So what kind ofjob
were you interviewing for?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.084
Ad sales.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.254
The only thing l ever
wanted to do was sales.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.631
l don't think most people
feel that way about their line of work.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.591
Yeah, l hear you.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.426
So you're hypertensive.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.265
l was on Diamox,
but l decided to go cold turkey.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.643
-You can't do that, Lou.
-lt was working.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.853
l was eating right. l was exercising.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.605
Acupressure, the whole thing.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.569
You know, if you press right here between
your thumb and your pointer finger...

15:04.112 --> 15:05.529
World peace.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.823
You can't go holistic on this one, Lou.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.700
We're gonna write you
a new prescription for Diamox

15:09.784 --> 15:10.867
and you're gonna have to take it.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.831
-These are shot.
-Yes.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.667
-You have good eyesight?
-Yeah, l do.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.128
But l'm doing that thing now
that everybody else does...

15:23.631 --> 15:26.633
Jackie, when you get a minute,
l need you in 1 .

15:33.641 --> 15:35.100
l need a cortisone shot.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.477
l can't do it myself. l know it's gonna hurt.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.981
-Are you kidding me?
-l need to bring my A game.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.484
l'm about to get a promotion, a big step,

15:44.819 --> 15:46.528
and l'm gonna remember the people
who got me there.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.946
Stop talking. What happened?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.657
l thrashed my instep playing hoops.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.077
l was down by eight and l drove the lane.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.330
-You have a bunion.
-No, l don't.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.750
Look, just do it. l prepped it already.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.628
My feet have been killing me for ten years.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.671
The guys in ortho are so stingy
with this cortisone.

16:04.756 --> 16:05.881
How about you get me one of these?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.508
You're really gonna need
to see a doctor about something like that.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.851
You're a big baby.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.897
-Hey!
-l know that smile.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.190
That's the Valium grin.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.901
-How's the nausea?
-l don't even remember it.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.527
Good news. Great.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.196
Let's get you up to see your wife.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.864
l'm not going back up there.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.241
-Sorry?
-l can't.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.995
You know, it's perfectly normal to be scared.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.622
You know what's scary?

16:39.082 --> 16:41.333
Watching my wife scream for ten hours,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.335
then shit right in front of me.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.878
They tell you that might happen,
but you think,

16:45.046 --> 16:49.174
"No, not her. Not my girl."

16:50.551 --> 16:53.136
When l was born my parents had a house.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.056
l have an alcove studio

16:56.140 --> 16:59.059
and about $1 ,000 in my savings account.

17:01.813 --> 17:02.896
What is that?

17:03.773 --> 17:04.773
lt's a start.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.985
Come on, let's go.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.782
-l think l'm having chest pains.
-No, you're not.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.410
You can't kick me out.
You're supposed to take care of me.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.744
Yes, l am.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.292
l don't know what l'm doing.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.169
Who does?

17:31.592 --> 17:34.344
You know what l did last week
instead of putting together a crib?

17:35.096 --> 17:37.848
l sent messages
to all my old girlfriends on Facebook.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.601
Maternity.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.566
l can't do it.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.446
l'm sorry, can you two
indulge me just a moment?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.530
l'm sorry.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.282
Here, here, put your head right here.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.742
lnhale, okay?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.201
This is what you're gonna smell every time

17:58.286 --> 17:59.661
you feel like you don't know
what you're doing.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.621
-You want to...
-Just smell.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.415
Okay.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.627
Oh, my God.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.629
They all smell like that?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.465
Well, there's only one way to find out.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.676
You got this.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.892
You...

18:25.646 --> 18:27.147
Thank you.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.150
Are you taking him home?

18:30.485 --> 18:33.111
-Her, yes.
-Congratulations.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.156
Did you bring the car seat?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.534
Fuck.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.078
What did you think we were gonna do, walk?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.503
-You're still here?
-l'm picking up a few extra hours this week.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.880
-Bonus Coop.
-What are you working on?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.258
We're working on changing
our fantasy football team name

18:55.343 --> 18:58.053
from Man Crush to Cooper Duper.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.598
You like me better than Dr. O'Hara,
don't you?

19:01.682 --> 19:04.518
You know, l'd like you a lot more
if you focused on your receivers.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.399
Diamox for the hypertensive salesman.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.984
Everything else seemed fine.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.653
Quite charming, really.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.113
Lou, totally my favorite patient this week.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.199
-Are you guys talking about Lou?
-Yep.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.952
No, do not take him. He's injured.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.495
Do you know anything about football?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.580
Okay, fine. You do it.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.083
Who's Lou?

19:28.251 --> 19:29.584
A patient.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.461
No competition there.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.381
He's so nice and he walks every morning.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.466
-l gave him my pedometer.
-Thank God.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.968
That robot voice was freaking me out.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.680
Prescription, glasses. Discharge him.
l am going home.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.475
l had dibs on that guy.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.687
Hey.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.569
For the barbecue.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
Here.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.162
You got to put your arms around me.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.890
l am never letting my girls
anywhere near one of those bikes.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.349
Yeah.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.812
But going over the bridge...
Got to give me that.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.690
l do. l do. lt was beautiful.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.944
-What are you looking at?
-Your hair is insane.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.112
Yeah, helmet head.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.162
Guys, where are you?

20:47.705 --> 20:49.456
Why don't you take that out back,
see if Kevin needs a hand?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.666
-l'm gonna go change.
-All right.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.299
-Stop!
-lt's faster.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.343
The steaks are gonna taste like lighter fluid.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.386
Trust me, l've been doing this a long time.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.680
-Oh, yeah? How long?
-Long enough.

21:06.057 --> 21:09.100
l love steak on the grill,
but God, it's bad for the environment.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.479
-That's a lot of CO2 for one meal.
-lt is?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.940
You know, it's not that bad.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.651
Not if... You know,
not if you only do it on special occasions.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.488
l turn the lights off in a room
if l'm not there in order to save energy.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.448
That's a big help.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.325
And l brought pie for dessert.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.910
You're cute.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.554
Kevin!

21:49.100 --> 21:50.266
Kevin?

21:54.522 --> 21:56.189
-Where is Kevin?
-What's wrong?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.482
Where is Kevin?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.568
Relax. He just went to drop off
some stuff at lmmaculate Virgin.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.696
We're having a clothing drive
for the unfortunate.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.532
Great, a clothing drive.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.450
The less fortunate.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.661
What does fortunate mean?

22:11.038 --> 22:12.872
Blessed, lucky.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.541
Like a cat with nine lives.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.876
We had so much extra stuff.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.420
-We did?
-Yeah.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.755
Yeah, but don't stress.
lt was only four boxes.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.382
lt was mostly Kevin's old T-shirts

22:22.466 --> 22:25.552
and some baby clothes from the basement.
You know, nothing fancy.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.637
Gymboree stuff
and some mismatched mittens.

22:30.307 --> 22:34.102
-Grace, are you all right?
-Dad's been gone for two hours.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.229
The school's only five minutes away.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.066
Gracie, would you go get me my lip gloss?

22:40.401 --> 22:41.735
Thank you.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.740
Look, l told him l'd watch the kids

22:46.824 --> 22:49.409
so he could get his ass
to an Al-Anon meeting.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.579
l mean, seriously, Jackie,
this is his damage, not yours.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.748
He doesn't talk about it
and that fucks him up.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.416
-You said that to him?
-Yeah.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.418
Like l'm gonna start
watching what l say now?

23:00.629 --> 23:01.755
Hi!

23:04.258 --> 23:05.508
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.594
-How's the job?
-Great.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.013
-Feels like l've been there for years.
-How are you?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.556
-Good.
-Good.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.563
-Are they watching a movie?
-Yeah.

23:18.647 --> 23:22.817
They decided on 20 minutes
of Toy Story 3 and 20 minutes of Annie.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.153
Are they still out there, Eddie and Tunie?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.280
Yeah, l don't think he wants to leave yet.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.240
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:29.408 --> 23:33.078
l felt like l had to get out of the way,
get more pie.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.039
lt's berry or something.
lt's fucking delicious.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.832
-You want some?
-No, thanks.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.462
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yeah, the parish.

23:42.797 --> 23:43.797
You can pray right here.

23:44.965 --> 23:48.384
l think Tunie may have given away
a box with the girls' baptism gowns in it.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.553
l don't want to make her feel bad,
but if l don't go check,

23:50.638 --> 23:51.763
l'm gonna...
Not gonna be able to sleep.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.098
You want me to go with you?

23:53.724 --> 23:55.183
You want to? You want to go for a walk?

23:55.392 --> 23:58.144
l think Tunie can flirt
and listen for the girls at the same time.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.438
Let me get my jacket.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.528
-What?
-l just like watching you eat standing up.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.537
-Okay, back in a minute.
-Yeah.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.497
Go ahead. l'll be here.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.046
Thank you. l'm happy to help out,

24:25.131 --> 24:27.382
but there were a couple of things in there
l didn't mean to give away.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.467
Of course. We're grateful
for anything you want to donate.

24:29.552 --> 24:30.969
-Take your time.
-Thank you.
