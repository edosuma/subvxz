07:50.345 --> 07:52.962
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.631
HE'S DIFFERENT.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.807
NOT LIKE HE
WAS AT ALL.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.726
SEEMS THE SAME TO ME.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.475
HE ONLY ET
TWO EGGS AGAIN.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.647
WHY, EVER SINCE
HE'S SPROUTED TEETH

08:04.693 --> 08:07.230
HE'S BEEN HAVING
THREE EGGS AT BREAKFAST.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.982

TASTE CAN CHANGE.

08:10.073 --> 08:14.067
AND HE GOES AROUND FIDDLING
VVITH THINGS NIGHT AND DAY.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.243
AND THE WAY HE GOES
AT THAT HARD WORK.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.164
WHY, HE WAS NEVER THAT
FRIENDLY WITH WORK BEFORE.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.538
YES, SIR, THAT'S
TRUE AT THAT.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.665
I RECOLLECT
WORRYING MANY TIMES

08:25.755 --> 08:28.918
THAT HE LEANED JUST A SHADE TOWARDS
THE SIDE OF SHIFTLESSNESS.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.750
NOT LAZY
EXACTLY BUT--

08:30.844 --> 08:33.756
NO. NO, JUST
UNINTERESTED.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.589
AND SINCE HIS SICKNESS, HE'S
BEEN FIGHTING IN THAT VVORK

08:36.683 --> 08:38.845

A YEAR BEHIND.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.597

THEY SAY HE'S STARTED FIDDLING
VVITH THINGS NOVV, LIKE AXES.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.880
I DON'T KNOW.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.512
HE WAS ALWAYS
SUCH A GOOD BOY.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.019
GENTS.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.017
WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOC?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.395
WE WAS JUST DISCUSSING
THAT MYRTLEBANK BOY.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.476

I GUESS YOU'VE HEARD HOVV
PECULIAR HE'S ACTED LATELY.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.201
YEAH, I HEARD. I AIN'T
ONE TO PASS ON GOSSIP.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.155

<i>WHERE WAS HE THEM 48 HOURS HE WAS SUPPOSED

11:11.588 --> 11:14.831
IF HE VVAS DEAD. E\/EN DOC SAYS
HE HAD THAT RARE SICKNESS.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.256
MAYBE I TOLD
A WHITE LIE, STRAUSS.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.086
MAYBE I VVAS THINKING OF HIS FOLKS'
FEELINGS VVHEN I BROUGHT UP THAT DISEASE.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.673
CAN YOU
STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT?

11:23.725 --> 11:27.514
I'M NOT THE KIND OF MAN TO SEND A BODY TO
THE GRAVE UNLESS I'M POSITIVE HE'S DEAD.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.094
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.100
SHOOT, YES,
WE KNOW YOU, DOC.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.769
I DID MORE THAN JUST
FEEL THAT BOY'S PULSE.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.356
WHEN HIS FOLKS
LEFT THE ROOM,

11:40.408 --> 11:42.524
I GAVE HIM
THE PIN TEST.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.783
I STABBED HIM
WITH A PIN.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.956
HE DIDN'T
EVEN FLICKER.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.035
THEN I HELD A
MIRROR TO HIS LIPS.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.746
IF THERE VVAS ANY LIFE
LEFT IN THE MAN AT ALL,

11:55.840 --> 11:57.797
HIS BREATH WOULD
FOG UP THE MIRROR.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.466
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.385
I PRONOUNCED HIM
DEAD, DIDN'T I?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.968
<i>THEN WHERE COULD HE HA\IE
BEEN FOR THEM 48 HOURS'?</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:08.266
WHY DON'T WE JUST
COME OUT AND SAY IT?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.060
WE'RE ALL A-THINKING IT.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.311
<i>YOU SAY IT, PETERS.
YOU GOT THE FLOOR.</i>

12:12.398 --> 12:14.776
I'LL SAY IT. YOU'RE

HOVV DO VVE KNOVV THE MAN VVHO GOT
UP AND CRAVVLED OUT OF THAT COFFIN

12:17.904 --> 12:20.111
IS REALLY
JEFF MYRTLEBANK?

12:20.198 --> 12:23.657
I WOULDN'T TALK LIKE THAT, GENTLEMEN.
IT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF TROUBLE.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.407
VVELL, I DON'T KNOVV. MY
GRANDMA, SHE USED TO TELL ME

12:27.455 --> 12:29.913
ABOUT EVIL SPIRITS
ROAMING AROUND THE WORLD

12:29.958 --> 12:32.825
TRYING TO FIND A
BODY TO TAKE OVER.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.913
SHE SAID THAT THEY'D STEAL A CORPSE
SOMETIME BEFORE A MAN VVAS GOOD DEAD.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.172
THAT KIND OF TALK'S
DANGEROUS, PETERS.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.173
ALTHOUGH I MUST OONFESS THIS THROVVS
A LOT OF DRY KINDLING ON THE FIRE

12:43.263 --> 12:46.756
