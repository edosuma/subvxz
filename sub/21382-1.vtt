00:52.052 --> 00:54.920
Hello? Hello.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.122
Pizza man's here. Hello.

00:57.157 --> 01:00.425
Fuck! I fucking... shit!

01:00.460 --> 01:03.228
Listen, man, the sign says
"driver only carries $20 cash."

01:03.263 --> 01:05.263
Shut up. Don't talk. Just
take everything you want.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.099
Just take the fucking pizza... back.

01:07.134 --> 01:10.302
Okay, all right. You don't have to do this.
Go, go. Against the wall.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.471
Against the wall! Get on your knees.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.740
Get on your knees. Jack?

01:15.775 --> 01:18.877
Walt? What the hell are you doing here?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.579
My job.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.148
What 30-year-old delivers pizzas?

01:24.351 --> 01:26.151
What are you doing with a gun, man?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.990
Shit.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.458
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.827
Hey.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.998
Jack. Jack, it's gonna be all right, man.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.766
Whoa! Against the wall!

01:41.801 --> 01:44.970
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Turn around. Get down on your fuckin' knees.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.472
Don't! No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.841
Look at the wall.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.843
Look at the wall. Please, man.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.045
Don't look at me.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.127
The nightmare is always the same.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.862
I see this

02:10.896 --> 02:14.032
black insect crawling.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.770
I follow the trail of blood

02:18.805 --> 02:22.407
and I find this little boy...

02:23.410 --> 02:25.010
Holding his mother's body.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.448
His eyes are filled with tears,

02:30.483 --> 02:32.884
her body is filled with shrapnel,

02:32.919 --> 02:36.889
and he's... Asking her to wake up.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.458
He thinks it's

02:40.493 --> 02:42.027
just a game.

02:43.563 --> 02:46.231
And maybe he's right.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.601
Life is...

02:50.770 --> 02:52.171
Just a game.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.940
Death always wins.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.514
I should've taken the
little boy in my arms.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.850
I should've taken him to safety, but...

03:06.186 --> 03:07.586
All I did...

03:08.855 --> 03:10.855
All I could do

03:10.890 --> 03:12.925
was to take out my camera...

03:14.728 --> 03:16.195
Take his picture.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.268
I was just doing my job.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.041
This is definitely a trigger for you, Jack.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.744
Why do you keep coming back to this story?

03:40.787 --> 03:42.887
Jack?

03:42.922 --> 03:44.389
Jack!

03:44.424 --> 03:46.124
Oh.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.894
Sorry about that.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.297
Was that Claire? Yeah.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.934
She's probably just worried
about dinner or something.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.869
How is that going?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.871
She wants me to get a job. You know.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.307
She wants me to... Get out of the house.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.577
But, uh, I guess I'm still, uh,

04:07.247 --> 04:10.448
having a hard time... You
know, getting adjusted.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.151
These things take time.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.288
But you've made the necessary steps.
I mean, you're progressing, Jack.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.423
Eighteen months.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.725
I think you're ready for
some new challenges,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.761
step a bit out of your comfort zone.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.497
I guess moving back to the Midwest

04:25.532 --> 04:30.068
is still a bit of a... transition.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.071
Don't worry about how long it took you
to get here, just that you're here.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.677
Hi. Sorry that I missed your call.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.412
I just, uh... Just got out.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.014
Hey, I'll be running a little late.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.784
They want me to stay until the end of this.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.687
- Do you mind taking care of dinner?
- Yeah, of course.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.023
- I can do dinner.
- Can't wait. Love you.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.763
You're free to take off if you like.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.299
I can inventory what's left of the listing.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.668
Up next, what was one of Mr. strung's
favorite pieces. Are you sure?

05:03.703 --> 05:05.970
Yeah. Yeah, I can handle it.

05:06.005 --> 05:10.108
It's a reconstructed film
camera from the 1930s.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.311
Doesn't Jack collect old cameras?

05:13.346 --> 05:17.115
Yeah, he used to. He gave all
that up when he got back.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.050
We'll open the bidding at $50.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.553
Yes, we have $50. Do I have 75?

05:22.355 --> 05:24.222
75? We have 75.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.195
You understand vegetables. I don't know.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.030
How did your session go?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.032
Uh, same old same old, you know.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.368
It was... It went well though.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.902
Pretty well. Okay.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.405
Okay, I have a surprise for you.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.907
Uh-oh.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.409
Wait here.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.079
Surprise?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.549
Mmm.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.719
It's your anniversary gift.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.421
Our anniversary isn't until n...

05:56.456 --> 05:58.423
shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Just open up. Open up.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.593
Okay.

06:06.232 --> 06:08.266
Oh.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.569
Uh... honey...

06:11.604 --> 06:14.372
I... I know, I know.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.008
Just check it out. Maybe
start a new collection.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.743
And this one's really unique.

06:18.778 --> 06:23.114
It's, like, 80 years old, but it's
still in really good condition.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.383
This is really special.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.685
I love it. Thank you. Wow.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.220
Really? Yeah. Thank you.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.089
You sure?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.591
Thank you. Okay.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.993
Wow. Okay, okay.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.963
Vintage SLR, huh?

06:38.998 --> 06:41.433
Well, if you want to test it out,

06:41.468 --> 06:45.437
there's... this gig at my
work I was telling you about.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.706
Oh. The gig. Right.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.444
Yeah. Ben's really excited about it.
He loves your work.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.480
And he really needs someone with
a real photography background.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.115
With all due respect, honey,

06:57.150 --> 06:58.483
I'm used to shooting, you know,

06:58.518 --> 07:00.618
sectarian conflicts, not condos.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.487
We need some progress here.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.956
Dr. Vogel said that I am making progress.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.625
I have a couple of job interviews
next week. I'm making progress.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.328
I just know how much you love photography.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.869
Hello.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.772
Just need some film developed. Yeah, sure.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.675
Um, so, we've got ten rolls then?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.044
Mm-hmm. All right, I'll get this started.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.379
I used to come here all
the time in high school.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.381
Lots of people do.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.618
You were still the manager back then.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.355
Uh, yeah, my career certainly has
taken off. Thanks for the reminder.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.624
Uh... I didn't mean it that way.

09:19.659 --> 09:24.462
I just meant that it's...
exciting to be shooting again.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.897
Yeah, that's exciting.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.134
Okay.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.438
Hey. How was your day? Hi!

09:33.473 --> 09:35.440
Uh, a lot like work, actually.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.775
How'd your big photo shoot go?

09:37.810 --> 09:42.246
Well, not exactly Ansel Adams,
but I think it went pretty well.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.082
Oh, my god.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.718
I'm so proud of you. That's great.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.586
It felt great to shoot again. It-it...

09:48.621 --> 09:50.088
Yeah. Yeah.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.323
Oh, that's so great. Back on the horse.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.759
Okay, great. I gotta run.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.661
Literally. Oh.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.879
Are you okay?

11:21.914 --> 11:23.881
No. No, I'm not okay.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.651
What? Some weirdo creeper was following me.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.519
What do you mean, following you?

11:28.554 --> 11:30.988
I mean like literally following me.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.824
What?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.794
I was running down the street
and he was keeping pace.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.763
And then I turned to our road

11:38.798 --> 11:40.698
to get to our street...

11:40.733 --> 11:43.835
he... my god. He had his hand in his pants.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.838
Did he touch you? No, no, no, no.
He touched himself.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.173
Well, where was he? No,
wait, wait, wait. Stop.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.175
Where was he? Come on. Come here.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.211
No, he... h-he's gone. He's gone.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.713
He... he stopped chasing me after a while.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.249
- Well, had you seen him before?
- I don't know.

11:58.284 --> 12:03.921
He was, like, this... This chubby
dude with glasses, wh-white shirt.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.624
- Well, we're calling the police.
- He doesn't know where I live.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.060
If he sees police cars, he will.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.462
Honey, what if he does this
to a kid or something?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.431
Baby, please. Calm down.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.633
I'm fine. Okay?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.637
We're like affectionate roommates.
Oh, okay.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.939
She's super open-minded. Hey, hey.
Give me a club soda?

12:21.974 --> 12:24.208
Hey! There he is. Hey.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.744
How's it goin', man? Good, good, good.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.080
Good. I'm feelin' good. Feelin' good.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.449
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.085
I'll have another one too, please.
Thank you.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.889
When are you gonna bring that beautiful
fiancée of yours in instead of this cretin?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.491
"Cretin"? Yeah, it's been a while.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.126
You guys are my favorite couple.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.763
- We could be somebody's favorite couple.
- Uh... eew. Mm-mmm.

12:45.798 --> 12:49.567
This is like our... we have a thing now,
like a Sam and Diane type situation.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.235
Ah, yeah, this thing where
she, like, hates him.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.070
How are you? Uh, good.

12:53.105 --> 12:57.008
What's new? Believe it or not,
I am actually shooting again.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.243
Yeah? All right. Yeah.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.912
Well, I'm kind of shooting.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.682
It's just a, uh... Like a
trial gig at Claire's work.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.819
Well, good! Good. You're back
doing what you were meant to do.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.521
Thought I was meant to win
the Robert Capa Award.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.724
Instead, I'm taking
pictures of real estate.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.961
But it's a start.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.364
I'm proud of you. Cheers. Cheers.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.166
Ah.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.903
I promised myself I'd never
pick up another camera.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.808
Let's take a walk.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.979
Just out back. There's
something I wanna show you.

13:35.014 --> 13:39.617
I don't know what you went
through over there. You know?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.385
It's none of my business.

13:41.420 --> 13:45.223
I know you're dealing with
it and you're processing it.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.959
I can't imagine how hard it is.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.729
But what I do know is that you
did absolutely everything

13:51.764 --> 13:54.232
to make sure that you did the right thing.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.534
You had a job to do.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.236
You did it.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.808
And you were really good at that job, man.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.911
It would be a real shame if you never
picked up a camera ever again.

14:09.081 --> 14:12.016
You know? It's a good... It's a good gig.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.652
Hell of a lot better than
what I do for a living.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.321
Yeah, what are you doing
for work these days?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.490
Little bit of this, little bit of that.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.594
Least I'm not selling my ass down on olive
street. Olive street has hookers now?

14:23.462 --> 14:24.862
Yeah.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.598
I-I mean, no... I... I hear...

14:27.633 --> 14:30.534
I'm a nice guy. I'm a married man.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.037
You know. Good boy. Yeah.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.707
If you do ever find yourself over on that
side of town, don't go asking for Cassandra.

14:36.742 --> 14:40.177
She's a... good friend of mine.
Personal... my friend.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.680
Okay. I will not touch your prostitute.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.383
Republican don Cheney leads
the race with 67%...

14:45.418 --> 14:48.686
Isn't this the guy who shot the panda?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.755
America makes the worst... It is.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.791
No! That never actually happened.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.359
Uh... yeah.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.128
Be careful.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.564
This coming from a guy who wanted
to spend the little money we have

15:00.599 --> 15:02.533
on infomercial knives.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.370
They were not just any ordinary knives.
They were Tanaka knives.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.773
Yeah, whatever.

15:08.808 --> 15:12.443
Sure, we've been needing to cut
through an old tire for a while now,

15:12.478 --> 15:14.211
so we should've gotten them.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.081
I assure you there are numerous
practical purposes for Tanaka knives.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.216
Tragedy on a playground. Oh, yeah? Yeah.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.986
A five-year-old somerset boy is dead
tonight after falling off a play set

15:22.021 --> 15:23.821
and breaking his neck.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.757
- Police are calling this an accident.
- I was over there yesterday.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.893
Hanging upside-down
before he slipped. What?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.496
Yeah, that's near the subdivision you
guys are showing over off Cordova.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.131
Uh, pick up for Jack Zeller.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.467
Yeah, um, "Z," Zell...

15:37.703 --> 15:39.671
one second, Sir. Okay.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.009
Jack Zeller's here. Yeah, okay.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.848
Mr. Zeller... it's on my desk.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.385
Uh, we've had a bit of an issue here.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.621
Uh, an issue?

15:57.656 --> 16:00.291
All your film was saved. Had
a little bit of a fire.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.694
Okay, uh, thank you for the heads-up.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.630
Yeah, uh, also, um...

16:06.999 --> 16:09.367
All your photos came out black-and-white.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.302
Black-and-white.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.771
I-I don't really understand it either.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.108
But because you're a valued customer
and because we've had these issues,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.043
there's not gonna be any charge for this.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.112
Only four rolls were developed,

16:21.147 --> 16:23.280
and those rolls are black-and-white?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.449
And we will call you
when the rest are ready.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.753
So if you need anything else, just come by.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.656
Thanks.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.876
A five-year-old boy is dead tonight
after falling off a play set

16:51.911 --> 16:54.212
and breaking his neck.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.435
Oh, what the fuck?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.784
Hey!

18:06.819 --> 18:09.320
Hey, you need to get out of here!

18:09.355 --> 18:10.822
You should not be here!

18:31.377 --> 18:34.178
Jack, whatever you're
doing there, hurry up.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.550
Uh, sorry. I'll be right there.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.864
What are you doing up here?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.300
Scared me. Sorry.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.602
I just wanted to check something.
It's nothing.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.737
Okay.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.206
Hey. Hi.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.441
Come back to bed, huh? Okay.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.711
Yeah, I'll be right down. Okay.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.683
Hey, um, don't forget.

19:12.718 --> 19:16.120
We're meeting Shannon and
Juliet at the pool tomorrow.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.489
The pool. Yeah.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.058
Okay.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.033
Can we be ready in ten minutes?

20:03.068 --> 20:05.903
Uh... sure.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.053
People usually come to the pool to relax.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.122
Mmm. Yeah, sorry.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.491
I'm just a bit out of it... today.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.127
Is everything okay? Yeah.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.762
I'm fine.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.798
Just didn't sleep well.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.400
Want some Valium?

20:36.435 --> 20:39.136
I'll pass on the Valium, thank you.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.641
Helps me when I'm dealing
with the old battle-ax.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.478
I can hear you.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.306
- Hey.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.875
Did you hear what I said?

21:54.179 --> 21:56.047
I just got off the phone with Shannon.

21:57.249 --> 22:00.184
Apparently a kid drowned after we left.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.924
That's just awful.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.226
Hey.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.396
Hey, pal. How you doing?

22:12.431 --> 22:14.065
Hey. Came right over.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.669
You drinkin'? You don't look too hot.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.538
I wanna show you something.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.078
Tell me what you see.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.349
Oh, j-Jesus, Jack.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.652
Do you see that? Yeah, I
don't wanna see this, man.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.954
This... this is...

22:39.391 --> 22:41.091
It's from over there, huh?

22:41.126 --> 22:43.093
Sorry. I just, uh...

22:43.128 --> 22:47.531
I wanted to make sure I wasn't...
going nuts.

22:47.566 --> 22:50.501
I mean, I know you just
picked up the camera again.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.170
That must be dredging up a
lot of these bad memories.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.707
But you don't need to go digging this stuff
up and carrying that around with you.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.546
- It's a little crazy, man.
- Well, maybe I'm not crazy.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.582
I'm sorry. That was a very poor
choice of words. You're not crazy.

23:05.617 --> 23:09.620
I didn't mean to say... so hear me
out on something for a second, okay?

23:11.156 --> 23:14.425
Okay, what if you knew

23:14.460 --> 23:17.728
someone was in danger... right?

23:17.763 --> 23:20.898
Or if you knew that they were going
to be in danger at a particular time.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.066
Would you be obligated
to try and save them?

23:23.101 --> 23:25.202
I don't know. You call the Cops, man.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.905
Mmm, the Cops might think I'm crazy too.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.274
Are you still seeing
that shrink on the reg?

23:30.309 --> 23:32.643
And taking your medication?

23:32.678 --> 23:35.212
Yeah, but it's not the meds though.

23:35.247 --> 23:39.249
Okay, 'cause if you drink while you're on
that stuff, it can do a number on you.

23:39.284 --> 23:42.219
Walt, I know how the
meds work, and that's...

23:42.254 --> 23:44.154
That's not it.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.123
This is more than that.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.560
Sounds like you're living in a,

23:49.595 --> 23:51.562
you know, weird episode of goosebumps.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.031
But that's not reality.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.802
You know, the reality...

23:58.837 --> 24:01.505
Is that I love you

24:01.540 --> 24:03.674
and Claire loves you.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.410
Everybody loves you, you're
back home, you're very safe

24:06.445 --> 24:08.745
and things are... really,
they're going well.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.048
Right? Things are going well.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.319
- I gotta get back to work.
- What, you can't stay?

24:15.354 --> 24:17.421
Yeah, I'm sorta on the clock.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.090
You should get out of here right now.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.693
Call me tomorrow. We'll
call each other. Okay.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.195
Or I'll see ya. Just...

24:25.998 --> 24:28.465
Uh, I'll be in touch. Okay. Thanks, man.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.000
All right.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.104
You okay, hon? You want another one?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.307
Uh, no, I think I'm... Fine for the moment.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.076
All right.

24:53.725 --> 24:57.060
Uh, you know what? I think,
actually, I'll do one more.

24:57.095 --> 25:00.431
Jack, last call was 20 minutes ago.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.411
- Yeah.
- Are you feeling all right?

25:14.446 --> 25:15.713
Sorry.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.487
I lost track of the time.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.222
Sorry.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.257
Was it a blackout again?

25:27.292 --> 25:29.726
I don't know. Kind of.

25:29.761 --> 25:32.663
Uh, this one was... Different.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.465
I don't know how to explain it.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.768
But more importantly,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.437
I have made you waffles.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.255
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.437
Can you stay with her?

26:47.472 --> 26:50.607
Stay here with her until help gets here.
Okay, buddy?

26:50.642 --> 26:53.344
Okay. Stay here.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.284
We turn now to action 6
news reporter penny Jones

27:01.319 --> 27:03.954
with an eyewitness report
from last night's Blaze.

27:03.989 --> 27:06.256
He told me to wait here for help.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.291
He just saved her and left.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.193
So you didn't know this man? Nuh-uh.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.529
I never seen him before.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.465
Well, despite the heroic
actions of this mystery man,

27:15.500 --> 27:18.535
unfortunately it's not all good news,

27:18.570 --> 27:21.438
as the rescued woman's elderly
mother, Elise partridge,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.540
was a victim of this deadly Blaze.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.476
- Ms. partridge was 76. Back to you.
- This is so depressing.

27:26.511 --> 27:28.545
Thanks, penny. Now a bizarre story...

27:28.580 --> 27:31.848
Well, actually, the main story
here was about this mystery guy

27:31.883 --> 27:33.650
who saved her daughter.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.820
So, you know, could've been much worse.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.655
Really?

27:38.690 --> 27:40.724
Well, that's good then.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.860
Nice thing to hear for a change.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.563
I'm late. Have a good day.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.249
"Vintage cameras."

28:10.288 --> 28:11.755
Hmm.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.566
Charlie Hibbert?

28:33.812 --> 28:35.779
Cabin.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.184
No. Don't.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.053
This had to end, Charlie.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.294
- No!

29:01.139 --> 29:03.440
We spoke on the phone about...
Oh, right, right.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.210
You're the one that had the vintage camera.
Let's have a look.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.279
Some of the parts inside look custom.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.683
It's like they're... they
were built piece by piece.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.558
Do you mind if I...

29:21.593 --> 29:23.327
Please.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.676
Huh.

29:47.719 --> 29:51.221
Well, Jack, what you have here...

29:53.291 --> 29:56.493
Is what's left of a Kine Exakta

29:56.528 --> 30:00.197
manufactured in Germany around
the beginning of world war ii.

30:01.967 --> 30:05.268
One of the features about the camera

30:05.303 --> 30:09.439
is the film advances from right to left.

30:09.474 --> 30:13.043
Yeah, I noticed that. It was sort of tricky
getting the film loaded in there at first.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.479
Huh.

30:16.514 --> 30:18.982
You loaded it? Yeah. Yeah.
I shot a few rolls.

30:19.017 --> 30:21.051
Well, I hate to tell you this.

30:21.086 --> 30:23.921
I don't think this camera
can generate an exposure.

31:06.064 --> 31:08.064
Good morning, beautiful.

31:08.099 --> 31:12.069
You're awake before me twice in one week.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.704
Is that the real Jack?

31:14.739 --> 31:17.173
Is that you?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.776
I am the real Jack... I think.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.778
Who is this?

31:23.448 --> 31:26.116
You will never guess what day it is today.

31:27.752 --> 31:30.320
It's, um... earth day.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.790
Try again.

31:33.825 --> 31:37.460
It's, uh... hedgehog day.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.396
Groundhog day? Is that what you're...

31:39.431 --> 31:41.431
No. No. Hedgehog day.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.002
Happy anniversary.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.075
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my god.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.778
Oh!

31:54.813 --> 31:57.280
You remember what, uh... mm-hmm.

31:57.315 --> 32:00.917
What I told you when I met
you at your exhibit in Rome?

32:00.952 --> 32:02.953
Remember what I said?

32:02.988 --> 32:06.123
What did you say? Um, I s...
you said... I said...

32:07.359 --> 32:09.592
That you were a much better artist...

32:09.627 --> 32:11.928
Than I was a photographer.

32:11.963 --> 32:15.131
So, what all do you need to do today?

32:15.166 --> 32:19.269
I've got to run to the camera store,
pick up the rest of the photos.

32:19.304 --> 32:22.439
Oh! You're bringing them
by the office, right?

32:22.474 --> 32:25.241
Uh, yeah. Of course.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.011
Well, maybe I'll see you
when you get there.

33:01.346 --> 33:02.980
Claire.

33:48.960 --> 33:53.063
Hey, I think you might be in a meeting.
I know you got a lot going on today.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.432
But I think we should go somewhere
else for dinner tonight.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.960
Hey. You ready?

34:23.995 --> 34:25.929
Uh, yeah. I'm just waiting for you.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.598
Well, work's been crazy. Do
you mind meeting me there?

34:28.632 --> 34:31.601
Yeah, well, I know we have a
lot of history at peterman's,

34:31.636 --> 34:35.638
but I thought we'd just, uh,
you know, try something new.

34:35.672 --> 34:37.739
Um, I'm at peterman's right now.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.609
What?

34:39.643 --> 34:42.045
N... no, please, uh...

34:42.080 --> 34:44.214
let's meet there, right? In ten minutes?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.149
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Claire?
- I'll see you here.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.384
Okay? Love you. Bye.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.087
Damn it. Fuck.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.389
Where the fuck is she?

34:54.425 --> 34:55.826
Language!

35:11.042 --> 35:13.910
Well, that was quite an entrance.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.212
Hey.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.848
What happened with your hand?

35:18.883 --> 35:21.251
Uh, my car window.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.153
It was, uh, an accident.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.687
What?

35:24.722 --> 35:26.923
- We have to go.
- Why?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.358
Jack, come on.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.793
Jack?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.062
What... Jack?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.865
Everything's fine.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.535
Sir.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.004
I'm sorry. Is everything okay?

35:41.039 --> 35:43.840
Are we gonna continue to have
problems here? No, no, no. I'm sorry.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.276
We're... we're leaving anyhow.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.011
Come on. Let's go home.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.214
I'm sorry.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.550
And I'll talk to Dr. Vogel again.

35:54.919 --> 35:56.586
Yeah. I'm sorry.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.990
Listen, I know that I...

36:01.025 --> 36:03.826
I totally just ruined our
anniversary, and I...

36:03.861 --> 36:05.628
excuse me.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.664
Could you spare some change?

36:07.699 --> 36:09.232
Um...

36:10.568 --> 36:12.802
- Man...
- hey! You following us?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.738
- Jack!
- I just need some change, man. Hard times.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.874
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Give me your fuckin' money.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.810
Oh! Hey. Hey.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.946
- Take it easy, man.
- Just toss it here.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.749
Here's the wallet. Okay?

36:27.285 --> 36:30.086
- What about her purse?
- Here's...

36:30.121 --> 36:33.189
here's the purse. Just take the purse.
Okay? Here's the purse.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.659
Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.605
Oh, my god!

36:53.211 --> 36:55.712
You remember? I don't know.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.614
It happened so fast.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.150
Dropped your keys. What happened next?

37:03.254 --> 37:05.422
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step back.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.899
How you holdin' up?

37:16.734 --> 37:19.402
Uh, I'm okay.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.538
It wasn't a very romantic anniversary.

37:22.573 --> 37:26.709
Well, thank you for all your cooperation.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.346
I know it's been a long
night for you both. Yeah.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.350
Yeah. Wow. What happened there?

37:34.986 --> 37:37.654
Oh, I, um...

37:37.689 --> 37:40.923
I left my keys in the car and I had to

37:40.958 --> 37:42.459
break the window.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.562
That's a new one.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.164
With your fist?

37:49.867 --> 37:51.001
Yeah.

37:53.504 --> 37:55.839
You two go and get some sleep.

38:26.704 --> 38:30.206
As the rescued woman's elderly
mother, Elise partridge,

38:30.241 --> 38:32.575
was a victim of this deadly Blaze.

38:37.181 --> 38:38.715
Oh, no.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.558
Claire moved.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.690
Ah! Goddamn.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.917
What the hell's that?

41:48.239 --> 41:50.840
He moved photos, which is good.

41:50.875 --> 41:54.477
But I'm worried about keeping this up.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.480
Whenever I feel that I can control this,

41:57.515 --> 42:00.816
I-it seems like everything
is crumbling around me.

42:00.851 --> 42:05.254
People say that they would do anything
to protect the ones they love.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.857
But they're never really
asked to do just that.

42:07.892 --> 42:11.694
It seems to draw whatever
evil's out there to it.

42:11.729 --> 42:14.397
It knew it could use me,
so I was exploited.

42:16.601 --> 42:21.237
These seemingly innocuous acts
now have greater meaning.

42:21.272 --> 42:25.575
But like a moth into a
flame, it gets burned too.

42:28.779 --> 42:31.080
Aah!

42:46.330 --> 42:50.399
Oh, there's this house, I'm
supposed to show it later.

42:50.434 --> 42:52.535
I feel like I should still do that one.

42:52.570 --> 42:56.973
No, babe. If there was ever a
day to take off, it's today.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.214
Hey, mister. You need some help?

43:39.817 --> 43:41.817
Your tire.

43:41.852 --> 43:43.386
Uh, no, I think I'm, uh...

43:44.455 --> 43:46.022
Think I'm all right. Thanks.

43:47.158 --> 43:48.524
You don't look all right, brother.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.997
You wanna hear a crazy story?

43:55.032 --> 43:58.834
Each developed roll contains one photo
that predicts an otherwise imminent death.

43:58.869 --> 44:01.937
Right? And each death can only be prevented

44:01.972 --> 44:05.107
by substituting another victim in
exactly the same modus operandi, right?

44:05.142 --> 44:08.210
But each victim, okay,
they replace the next.

44:08.245 --> 44:11.313
The pictures keep changing,
on and on, day after day,

44:11.348 --> 44:16.652
until the last victim on the last roll,
who, uh, happens to be my fiancée,

44:16.687 --> 44:18.554
is saved.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.556
Right?

44:20.591 --> 44:24.193
But this is... I mean, of course this
is all predicated on the supposition

44:24.228 --> 44:27.396
that I'm not just having
a full-onset psychosis.

44:27.431 --> 44:30.032
Either this camera is, like, demonic,

44:30.067 --> 44:33.469
or I'm... psychotic.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.171
So it's crazy.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.406
Right?

44:38.175 --> 44:40.042
My name's Boone.

44:40.077 --> 44:41.577
Jack.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.348
I don't understand a word you been saying.

44:46.884 --> 44:49.252
But it's nice to have somebody to talk to.

44:50.387 --> 44:52.455
Okay.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.170
You're leaving again already?

45:08.205 --> 45:10.273
You'll be all right? Yeah.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.581
Good luck. You're gonna do great.

45:18.616 --> 45:19.949
Mmm.

45:21.819 --> 45:23.453
Love you. Love you.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.799
It's fuckin' crazy.

45:44.074 --> 45:45.942
Okay, this is crazy.

45:46.677 --> 45:47.977
This is...

45:51.148 --> 45:52.749
Really crazy.

46:03.427 --> 46:05.428
Oh, you fuckin' creeper.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.404
He was, like, this chubby dude
with glasses, white shirt.

46:57.314 --> 46:59.949
Ow! Oww!

46:59.984 --> 47:02.151
Who are you?

47:02.186 --> 47:04.720
Why are you doing this to me?

47:11.595 --> 47:14.330
Why are you doing this to me?

47:16.700 --> 47:19.034
I'm sorry!

47:19.069 --> 47:21.103
I'm sorry!

47:45.062 --> 47:48.163
Please... stop.

47:57.942 --> 47:59.609
Fucking hell.

48:07.384 --> 48:08.818
The head.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.628
What the fuck... Shit.

48:22.566 --> 48:23.900
What the fuck...

49:06.276 --> 49:08.610
Please, change.

49:36.373 --> 49:37.840
Please.

49:39.710 --> 49:41.177
No.

51:03.427 --> 51:05.027
Hey.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.469
You drifted off there.

51:13.504 --> 51:16.071
Is the movie that boring?

51:16.106 --> 51:18.674
Uh, no. No. I'm sorry.

51:19.676 --> 51:22.711
How did the interview go?

51:22.746 --> 51:25.314
Uh, it went fine.

51:26.683 --> 51:28.084
Okay.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.287
And Ben? Did he like the photos?

51:32.322 --> 51:34.323
Yeah. He seemed to.

51:36.493 --> 51:38.360
See, I told you.

51:41.265 --> 51:46.335
So, um, this might sound
like a weird question.

51:46.370 --> 51:47.837
But, um...

51:50.274 --> 51:55.110
Okay, um, let's say that there is someone

51:55.145 --> 51:59.548
who somehow managed to know when
and where they were going to die.

52:00.717 --> 52:03.685
Would you want to know?

52:03.720 --> 52:07.422
That is a weird question.

52:07.457 --> 52:08.858
But would you?

52:11.728 --> 52:13.696
You really want me to answer that?

52:20.504 --> 52:22.938
No.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.708
No, I don't think I'd want to know.

52:28.845 --> 52:31.180
It's a burden.

52:31.215 --> 52:32.715
It could drive you crazy.

52:35.886 --> 52:39.121
Can we be done with all these
creepy hypothetical questions?

52:39.156 --> 52:40.489
Come here. Yeah.

52:41.525 --> 52:43.159
Yeah.

52:47.097 --> 52:49.231
Next time we're watching a romantic comedy.

52:49.266 --> 52:50.900
That's for sure.

53:18.462 --> 53:21.163
Hello. Hi. Mrs. Henderson?

53:21.198 --> 53:23.865
Hi. I'm calling from Abrams realty.

53:23.900 --> 53:26.702
Um, I apologize, but would it be possible

53:26.737 --> 53:29.939
for us to move our meeting
with you to tomorrow?

53:32.442 --> 53:34.310
Great. Thank you so much.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.780
Hey, some lady just called your phone

53:38.815 --> 53:42.217
about switching your 5:00 P.M.
meeting to tomorrow.

53:42.252 --> 53:44.786
Henderson, I think it was.

53:44.821 --> 53:46.622
Okay.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.624
You answered my phone?

53:48.659 --> 53:51.627
I did. Sorry. I was, like, half asleep.

53:51.662 --> 53:53.662
I didn't know what I was doing.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.771
Ow.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.474
Fuck.

54:10.314 --> 54:11.780
Mmm.

54:21.091 --> 54:22.491
Ow.

54:42.879 --> 54:44.480
Oh, fuck!

54:47.517 --> 54:49.351
You should get that looked at.

54:51.988 --> 54:55.524
Now get out of my way, so I can get ready.

55:02.532 --> 55:03.866
Did you have another nightmare?

55:05.802 --> 55:07.536
I think I'm still sleeping.

55:09.906 --> 55:12.708
Hey. Welcome to tad's hardware.

55:12.743 --> 55:15.977
We have the hardest wood and
the lowest prices, guaranteed.

55:16.012 --> 55:18.180
If there's anything I can
help you with specifically,

55:18.215 --> 55:19.981
I can walk you around the store.

55:20.016 --> 55:22.284
I'm just picking up some stuff.
Okay. All right.

55:22.319 --> 55:25.454
Well, my name's tad, if you need anything.
I'm actually the owner.

55:25.489 --> 55:28.156
I'm pretty proud of that. Okay.

55:28.191 --> 55:29.825
Uh, this isn't corporate.

55:29.860 --> 55:33.795
Okay. Well, get to it.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.230
Okay.

55:38.034 --> 55:40.903
Okay. Have a great shopping experience.

56:07.030 --> 56:10.399
That, my friend, is one
fine-quality hammer.

56:10.434 --> 56:13.735
It's Polynesian wood. 7.2 ounce head.

56:13.770 --> 56:16.705
It's fantastic. The problem
is, your swing is terrible.

56:16.740 --> 56:20.275
It's worse than my two-year-old
nephew's, and he's got Parkinson's.

56:20.310 --> 56:22.611
Look, do you mind if I just
show you proper technique?

56:22.646 --> 56:26.081
Yeah. Okay. See, you want to
keep your wrist straight.

56:26.116 --> 56:28.417
If you're not strong enough
with these tiny wrists,

56:28.452 --> 56:30.719
to keep your wrists straight,
you can duct tape 'em.

56:30.754 --> 56:34.923
That'll really help. Okay? You want
to come with a nice, powerful swing.

56:34.958 --> 56:37.459
All right? Is there anything else I can
help you with before you check out?

56:37.494 --> 56:39.094
I think that should do it. Okay.

56:39.129 --> 56:42.631
'Cause I was just thinking.

56:42.666 --> 56:45.200
Why are you touching me? Maybe
you could use a nice tool belt

56:45.235 --> 56:47.469
to cover up those dainty hips.

56:47.504 --> 56:50.872
Can we check out now? Yeah. Yeah.
I'll meet you over there.

56:50.907 --> 56:53.375
All right. That'll be 42.97.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.911
Authorities believe they
have found the remains

56:55.946 --> 56:58.079
of notorious serial killer Charlie Hibbert.

56:58.114 --> 57:01.883
A body was discovered late
last night in a storm shelter

57:01.918 --> 57:05.320
on the same grounds of the cabin
where his family was slain.

57:05.355 --> 57:08.957
An autopsy is under way to determine
if their suspicions are correct.

57:08.992 --> 57:11.326
- Hey. Hey.
- Earth to my customer.

57:11.361 --> 57:13.728
There he is.

57:13.763 --> 57:16.832
Earth calling.

57:16.867 --> 57:19.468
- I actually need one more thing.
- Sure.

57:19.503 --> 57:23.738
Do you have that stuff where you,
like, if you put it on a rag

57:23.773 --> 57:26.508
and you smell it, I-i-it knocks you out?

57:28.178 --> 57:30.111
You wanna knock somebody out?

57:30.146 --> 57:32.914
You got, like, an ex-wife
you don't like or...

57:35.519 --> 57:39.955
um, this isn't what it looks like.

57:39.990 --> 57:45.360
Right. Looks like a Charlie
Hibbert starter kit.

57:45.395 --> 57:48.763
Thirteen years on the FBI's most-wanted
list, but the case went cold.

57:48.798 --> 57:52.367
Actually, man, I'm gonna need
to know what you're doing here.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.839
Authorities hope this new evidence
will finally bring closure

57:57.874 --> 57:59.374
to the families of the victims.

58:02.045 --> 58:04.213
Action 6 news will continue
coverage as the story...

58:19.396 --> 58:20.729
Where the fuck did he go?

59:01.271 --> 59:03.838
Goddamn it!

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:03.498
Tanaka.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.192
Oh.

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:33.061
It's my psychiatrist.

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.873
Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:00.809
Sorry again about the mix-up today.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:04.646
I'm really excited to show
this property to you now.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:08.717
I think we have found the
new Hendersons family home.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.687
Wait until you see the foyer. It pops.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.153
You okay?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.059
No. I'm not okay.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.696
Are you okay?

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:57.532
Uh... yeah, sorry. I...

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.534
I think I had another blackout.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.203
I must have fallen down
the stairs or something.

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.038
Is it getting that bad again?

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:07.175
It's okay. Is it?

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.710
Yeah.

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:11.512
Looks like your bad day is
turning into a bad week.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:14.716
You fall through the
passenger window this time?

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.551
It's just an accident.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:19.420
Oh. You accident-prone?

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:23.057
I'm accident-prone, so I'm just...

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:25.159
she's been through a lot.
Can we go home now?

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.127
Claire?

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.998
How are you?

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.433
Listen, I know this is
probably an inopportune time,

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.736
but we're gonna need to get your statement.

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.672
Do you want me to go with you?

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.440
No, stay here. I've got this.

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.809
Okay.

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.213
Baby, you... you okay?

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:48.082
Huh? Leave me alone.

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:50.018
I don't want to leave you alone.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.021
I want to make sure that you're okay.
Are you okay?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.056
Well, good luck with that. What?

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.859
'Cause I'm not sure if I will be okay.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.128
Do you want to talk about it? No.

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:04.432
I think we should talk about it.
You wanna talk about it?

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.334
Okay. Who are you?

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.538
What? 'Cause I don't...

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.775
whoever this is, this is not my Jack.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.910
I don't know what's going on.

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.480
I know you've been struggling with things,

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.783
but at least you never used to lie to me.

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:26.421
I'm not lying to you. I just don't
know what the truth is anymore.

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:29.991
Well, me neither. I talked to Ben.

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:32.460
I know you never dropped off the photos.

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.296
The photos. I've been wanting to talk
to you about the photos. Okay. Tell me.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.131
There's something wrong with the photos.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:39.167
There was something in the
photos that I can't explain.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:42.737
And you couldn't pick up the
phone to tell him that?

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.406
I'm sorry. I got you this job.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.108
I know.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:50.645
By the way, it's the only job
you've had in over a year.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.581
I know that. I'm sorry. I have
another interview tomorrow.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.616
What difference does it make?

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:58.353
You're just gonna fuck it up too.
Now leave me alone.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:02.623
I know now it's not a
coincidence I was picked.

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:07.295
I was flawed, desperate and depressed.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.631
Clearly, the victim. It could see that.

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:13.935
But in the end, I did what I had to do,

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.105
what I felt I needed to do.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.940
But I was never in control.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.641
That's what it wanted all along.

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.810
It knew the entire fucking time.

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.546
Every moment I thought it
could never get worse.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.650
I just... look, I was wrong.

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:55.970
God bless America.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:59.600
Hey, handsome. Can I help you out?

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:03.804
Um, I'm not sure exactly how this works.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:07.041
Honey, if you're not sure how this
works, you might be in the wrong place.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:12.279
Um, w-well, how much for...

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:17.018
Uh... you're not... you're
not Cassandra, are you?

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:19.020
Cassie ain't here, sweetie.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:20.421
Nice window.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:23.725
We on?

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.028
Uh...

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.126
Jesus Christ.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:35.296
Not so loud.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.013
Is somebody here?

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:32.987
Hello?

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.455
Fuck.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.024
Uh, Shannon? Is that you?

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.860
It's me. It's Jack.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.696
Jack, what are you doing here?

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.765
Um, I'm just fixing something.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.236
Claire said that there was a...
a plumbing situation.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.173
What? Why are you the one doing this?

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:57.211
Listen, just finish up. I'm showing
the place here in a few minutes.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.713
Okay.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:04.285
- Shit!
- Jack, what the hell?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.054
This is really weird.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:08.856
- Jack!

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.128
It's not what it looks like.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.663
Oh, fuck!

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.299
Listen to me.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.667
You know me. No.

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.502
You know that I would never hurt you.

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.738
Let me out! Listen to me. Listen, listen.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.840
Listen, listen, listen, okay?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.975
I'm trying to protect Claire. No.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.344
Okay? I can explain this. Listen to me.

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:32.213
I can explain. No.

01:12:32.248 --> 01:12:36.183
Claire is in danger. I'm
trying to protect her. Okay.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.719
Let me go. Get off of me. I
can't let you leave here.

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:42.056
I can't let you leave. Please,
don't make me do this.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.759
Okay? Sorry.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:47.095
No! I'm sorry.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.201
You okay, baby?

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.570
You look a little sick.

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:39.006
No. I'm fine.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.218
You shouldn't have done all this.

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.221
Well, I wanted to.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.159
Besides,

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:02.430
I don't really feel like a
great girlfriend right now.

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:07.034
I said some things last
night that I regret.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.370
Fiancée.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.073
That's right.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:15.142
Would you like some more wine?

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.044
Please.

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.287
Getting full service here. Mm-hmm.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.263
You've got a little steak
sauce on your finger.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.535
Oh, that's not... uh...

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:45.266
Fuck.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:04.818
- Do you want to jump into the tub with me?
- Uh...

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:08.189
you look beautiful, but I think
I'm just gonna rest here.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:22.236
Just one more.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.768
Oh, my hand! Jack! Jack!

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.772
Jesus! Here.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.942
What the fuck?

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:39.046
Hey. Can I take a bath now?

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.781
What?

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.083
What's going on? Your hand.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:45.119
What about it? Jack.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:48.288
Jack, what's going on?

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:51.425
You were screaming. I thought
I heard you screaming.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.561
No. No, I wasn't screaming.
You weren't screaming?

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.897
Are you all right?

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.733
I'm sorry. I'm just, uh...

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.303
hey. Just tired.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:08.208
No. No. No.

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:11.979
It's enough! Enough of
just writing this off.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:15.315
I don't know what else to do anymore.
You have to trust me.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:16.984
It's hard to... hard to explain.

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:18.519
Oh, my god.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.989
This is it.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.795
I'm sorry. I can't do...

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.098
I'm so sorry for everything
that I've put you through.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.669
I'll tell you everything.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.307
I was always gonna be here.
It was always gonna be me.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:42.643
Just like the guy before
me, the guy before him.

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.912
And on and on. I don't know where
it begins or where it ends.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.980
Evil curses, doctors, spirits. All of them.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.449
Flawed, ignorant, hopeless.
We have one fate.

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.652
One pre-fucking-destination!

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.521
It's the elections, wars...

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.129
The bugs we step on when
we walk across the street!

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:05.632
We think we can change things.
We think we're in control.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.916
Hey, Jack. Can we steal you for a minute?

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.051
I'm gonna need you to come with us.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.721
Uh, sorry. This isn't a good time.
It's time to go.

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:03.323
You don't have a say in this.
What's going on here?

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.259
Uh, just... lock the door. I'll be okay.

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.094
Wait, Jack. What's going on?

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.930
Jack?

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.105
He's not going anywhere.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:20.541
On what grounds? My grounds.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:26.213
Look, you've made your point clear.

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:28.282
Just give me a few more hours with him.
He's gonna break.

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:32.786
Ford, you're being awful quiet over there.

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:34.888
Do we have enough to hold him any longer?

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:37.591
No, Sir. We don't.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:42.896
I know how hard you've been working
on this, but just stay on it.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.399
Get more on him and let's charge this guy.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:48.235
With all due fucking respect,
you're making a mistake.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.370
This man spent six months in a war zone.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.806
As a photographer. Jesus Christ.

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:55.809
Do you know what he saw? Do you
know what he is desensitized to?

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.644
This man's friends died in front of him.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.947
He lost everything.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.882
I'm not saying that he's cleared,

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.751
but if he's innocent, for us to keep
him here, to put him through this...

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:08.455
this is retarded. He already admitted he was
in river hills subdivision on Thursday.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.490
Which he explained.

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.626
Now, with all due respect,

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.695
I don't think we can keep
someone here based on a hunch.

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:19.566
And can we please not use "retarded"
like that? It's offensive.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.401
No one says that anymore.
Fucking millennials.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:24.271
All right, all right. Let's calm down here.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:28.308
Dawson, I trust you, but we need more.

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.144
Now let's do this right.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.546
Cut him loose.

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:34.815
Yes, Sir.

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.570
Let me out of here!

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.710
You can't keep me here without an attorney!

01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:14.448
Get me out of here!

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.972
Look, I've been here all day. Okay?

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.875
I've been cooperative with you. I am not
gonna say another word without my attorney.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.778
Gunshot to the neck. Falls four stories.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.581
Stabbed in the stomach. Skull crushed.

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:49.049
Beaten and impaled.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:52.486
Which was your favorite, Mr.
Zeller? Talk to me.

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.955
What the hell is he still doing here?
Sir, she's impossible.

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:57.591
I put you with her to keep
her from doing this shit.

01:24:57.626 --> 01:24:59.326
Get him out of here.

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:03.497
Mr. Zeller, you're free to go.

01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:11.338
See ya. Drive safe, Jack.

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:12.532
Yes, Sir. Hi. Um...

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:15.402
about those deaths that have
been in the news lately.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.579
Hey, baby. I'm on my way home.

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:28.815
I need you to stay in the house, okay?
Make sure the doors are locked.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.084
I... fuck.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.922
Damn it. I need you to go faster.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:37.257
Claire?

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.094
Claire?

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:45.065
Claire, listen to me.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.100
Whatever you do today,

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:50.003
do not go to the warehouse, okay?

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:53.106
Don't go to the warehouse. Call
me when you get this, okay?

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:57.777
I don't know how this is gonna end.

01:26:57.812 --> 01:27:00.347
I, uh...

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:03.550
I may have to go away for a while.

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:05.418
But, uh,

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:07.520
I just want you to know that

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.589
whatever I did

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.524
I did it for us.

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:13.260
For you.

01:27:13.295 --> 01:27:15.028
Okay?

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.797
I love you.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:23.637
I didn't think too much of it at first.

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:25.772
Lots of people bring me weird things.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.776
Plus, I knew Jack from years ago.

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:32.812
- Who?
- Jack Zeller.

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:33.981
Shit.

01:27:45.527 --> 01:27:46.927
Boone?

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.266
Boone!

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.840
Boone!

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.360
Claire?
