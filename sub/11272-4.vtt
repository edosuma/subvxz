00:03.400 --> 00:07.733
''And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming

00:07.908 --> 00:12.824
''And the lamplight o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor

00:13.001 --> 00:17.548
''And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor

00:17.718 --> 00:21.851
''Shall be lifted...never more!''

00:23.855 --> 00:28.687
- Doc, you tell great stories.
- That was Poe.

00:28.865 --> 00:31.322
Don't be modest. lt was great.

00:33.499 --> 00:37.167
Who's next to chill us
with a scary story?

00:37.340 --> 00:39.630
l think l have a chilling tale.

00:39.802 --> 00:42.509
Yeah, but it's cute when you wiggle it.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.354
l got the greatest ghost story ever told.

00:48.527 --> 00:52.528
Casper got caught
in this huge laundry basket...

00:52.702 --> 00:56.156
Don't finish it.
Some of us want to sleep tonight.

00:56.334 --> 01:00.964
You're right, Carla.
lt's best that l live with it myself.

01:01.134 --> 01:03.544
My God, what a horrible sight.

01:04.766 --> 01:09.100
Speaking of horrible sights, Coach,
take a look at...this!

02:25.418 --> 02:27.460
Two vodka rocks with a twist.

02:27.631 --> 02:31.846
Didn't l tell you that
Halloween at Cheers would be fun?

02:32.014 --> 02:34.722
Yes, but l won't hold it against you.

02:34.895 --> 02:37.768
l got those two tickets
for the Boston Pops.

02:37.942 --> 02:41.315
- Wonderful.
- Are you going to the Boston Pops?

02:41.491 --> 02:44.613
- l'm jealous.
- You sound like a fan, Sam.

02:44.789 --> 02:49.621
The Boston Pops
was the one cultural event

02:49.798 --> 02:52.089
that Sam genuinely liked.

02:52.261 --> 02:57.057
Yeah. l especially liked
the 1 8 somethingth overture.

02:57.229 --> 03:01.479
- 1 81 2. - You really know your stuff.
Yeah.

03:01.654 --> 03:04.658
Till Diane dragged me to that concert,

03:04.827 --> 03:09.077
l never realised just how many
years of practice and dedication

03:09.252 --> 03:11.495
it takes to become a musician.

03:11.673 --> 03:16.339
- Anyone in particular impress you?
- Yeah, the guy on the cannons.

03:16.515 --> 03:22.107
He's incredible. You know, l actually
thought about taking it up myself,

03:22.277 --> 03:27.026
but l think it's one of those things
you have to start when you're young.

03:27.202 --> 03:32.083
- They say to be truly great, you do.
- That's what l thought.

03:34.967 --> 03:41.687
Sometimes l think Sam is pretending to
be less intelligent than he really is.

03:41.855 --> 03:48.943
But how intelligent would someone have
to be to pretend to be that dumb?

03:51.081 --> 03:55.462
- l'm not even sure l could pull it off.
- Yes, you could.

04:01.977 --> 04:07.403
l'm sorry, Carla, if we offended you
with our public display of affection.

04:07.571 --> 04:11.904
But try to understand, Frasier Crane
has the same effect on me

04:12.079 --> 04:18.087
that cheap chianti and dice hanging
from a rear view mirror have on you.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.513
You got it bad.

04:24.812 --> 04:28.064
Hello, everyone.
And a happy All Hallows' Eve.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.458
- Guess who l am.
- Cliff Clavin.

04:38.838 --> 04:41.295
No, Coach, let me give you a hint.

04:41.468 --> 04:44.341
l went to Florida
to find the fountain of youth.

04:44.515 --> 04:46.260
Cliff Clavin.

04:48.189 --> 04:50.349
Coach, l'm Ponce de Le贸n.

04:50.526 --> 04:54.195
- l think your ears are too big.
- For Ponce de Le贸n?

04:54.367 --> 04:57.989
- No, for you, Cliffie.
- l don't know, Coach.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.457
l'm very proud of my big ears.

05:00.629 --> 05:05.794
A lot of women consider them
erogenous zones during heavy petting.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.309
Are you kidding?
You never had a date in your life.

05:09.479 --> 05:12.981
Because he's never had the guts
to ask a girl out.

05:13.153 --> 05:15.444
lt's got nothing to do with guts.

05:15.615 --> 05:20.246
lt's just that the women you find in
the northeastern seaboard bore me.

05:20.416 --> 05:24.833
l prefer southern belles.
The kind of women you find in Florida.

05:25.008 --> 05:28.012
He's going to go on about Florida again.

05:28.182 --> 05:31.636
When l was down there,
l was covered with women.

05:31.814 --> 05:37.405
- Sure they weren't mosquitoes?
- Thank you, Bob Hopeless.

05:37.574 --> 05:41.160
l'll just go in the back
and scope out the dollies.

05:41.331 --> 05:45.035
- Why don't you guys lighten up on Cliff?
- Sorry, Sam.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.383
But you've got to admit,
it's a little bit weird.

05:48.553 --> 05:52.139
He's never been married.
l've never seen him with a woman.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.729
Norm, he's your best friend.
ls he gay or what?

05:55.900 --> 06:00.863
l can't believe what l'm hearing! You
can't tell a gay guy by his appearance.

06:01.035 --> 06:04.739
We had an outfielder on the Red Sox,
Duke Roberts.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.707
He never got married or went with girls.

06:07.882 --> 06:12.963
He even wore fancy ltalian shoes and
he lived with a guy who was a florist.

06:13.141 --> 06:15.183
And Duke wasn't gay.

06:16.397 --> 06:18.558
Yes, he was, Coach.

06:21.115 --> 06:24.321
He was?
Do you think he'd like to meet Cliffie?

06:29.673 --> 06:33.211
Come on, guys. Cliff is not gay, all right?

06:33.388 --> 06:38.350
He's just shy around women to the point
of being a blithering idiot.

06:38.523 --> 06:43.154
Diane, that was a colleague
on the phone. He's taken ill.

06:43.324 --> 06:47.407
He wants me to take his place
tomorrow at a seminar

06:47.582 --> 06:51.417
at the University of Chicago.
l've got to go home and pack.

06:51.590 --> 06:55.376
- We won't be able to go to the concert.
- You can still go.

06:55.555 --> 06:59.806
Listen, take along a friend.
Sam indicated some interest.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.940
Sam?

07:03.111 --> 07:07.159
l think l could find more stimulating
company for the concert.

07:07.327 --> 07:11.329
l wouldn't have to look farther
than the nearest Petri dish.

07:13.255 --> 07:20.474
Once again, l am startled by how far you
are above petty emotion like jealousy.

07:20.645 --> 07:26.403
l just figured it was time Sam learned
to appreciate instruments without fuses.

07:27.490 --> 07:31.278
- Goodbye, my tiny Alice.
- Goodbye, my mad Mad Hatter.

07:32.250 --> 07:37.795
There are many theories why the Florida
orange is superior to the Californian.

07:37.968 --> 07:42.220
l think it's the trace mineral
element in the Floridian water.

07:42.394 --> 07:48.817
Due to the frequency of the typhoons
and the nitrogen-rich alligator guano.

07:48.989 --> 07:54.700
- Furthermore, there's three...
- l just remembered l left my oven on.

07:55.794 --> 07:58.418
lf l hurry home, l can stick my head in it.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.773
Florida oranges are delicious.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.117
- What?
- Nothing.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.673
Have you been to Florida?

08:22.804 --> 08:27.386
No, but it's always been
a crazy dream of mine to go.

08:27.563 --> 08:32.561
l read that they have the world's largest
pair of alligator shoes there.

08:33.866 --> 08:38.081
That's right. ln Orlando.
l even sat in one of them.

08:42.883 --> 08:47.098
- What's your name?
- Tinker Bell. What's yours?

08:47.267 --> 08:50.638
Me? l guess it's Ponce de Le贸n.

08:51.733 --> 08:54.654
The guy that discovered Florida.

08:54.823 --> 08:57.742
Would you marry me
and bear my children?

09:00.750 --> 09:05.464
Would you like to go in the back
and maybe play some pool?

09:05.635 --> 09:09.802
Or as they say in Tallahassee,
shoot some pocket billiards?

09:09.976 --> 09:14.975
- l'd love to, Mr Le贸n.
- Please, call me Ponce.

09:16.780 --> 09:21.079
lt looks like you're out to conquer
new territories, Ponce.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.915
Holy God.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.144
Did anyone ever tell you
you dance divinely, Ponce?

10:01.323 --> 10:03.781
Someone mentioned it to me.

10:03.953 --> 10:06.707
Was that Cortez or Pizarro?

10:08.086 --> 10:10.960
l'm ready to go.
Would you hand me my purse?

10:11.133 --> 10:13.175
l'll put a new tune on the jukebox.

10:13.346 --> 10:19.141
l'm not using a pair of tickets
tomorrow for the Boston Pops.

10:19.315 --> 10:22.023
You can have them if you're interested.

10:22.196 --> 10:27.076
- No, thank you.
- You'll enjoy it!

10:27.248 --> 10:31.878
The programme is an evening
filled with fireworks and laser beams,

10:32.048 --> 10:36.798
occasionally interrupted
with the music of Gershwin.

10:36.974 --> 10:41.688
l just can't think of who l'd take.

10:41.858 --> 10:46.940
Most of the women l date
don't like music they can't dance to.

10:47.119 --> 10:51.831
Most of the women you date don't like
music they can't shed clothing to.

10:56.970 --> 11:00.093
- How come you don't want to go?
- l do.

11:00.268 --> 11:05.729
But Frasier's out of town and l can't think
of anyone l'd like to go with.

11:07.950 --> 11:12.200
l guess Frasier would feel
uncomfortable if you and l went.

11:12.375 --> 11:19.261
- No, actually he suggested it.
- So, you'd be uncomfortable?

11:21.057 --> 11:23.099
Not at all.

11:23.270 --> 11:27.521
While you still harbour
tortured longings for me,

11:27.695 --> 11:33.039
the emotions are unreciprocated.
l don't see why we shouldn't go together.

11:33.206 --> 11:38.798
- Then it's a date.
- No, not a date. l mean not a date date.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.008
Well, it's a...

11:41.179 --> 11:43.933
What would you call
an evening with a woman

11:44.101 --> 11:48.768
when you have absolutely no hope
of physical involvement whatsoever?

11:48.943 --> 11:51.021
A first.

12:14.033 --> 12:19.032
l guess it's time for me to be heading
back to Never Never Land.

12:19.209 --> 12:22.663
- Let me walk you back to your car?
- No, that's OK!

12:22.841 --> 12:25.050
lt's right outside here.

12:27.266 --> 12:32.016
But l just want to know when we're going
to see each other again.

12:32.192 --> 12:35.030
We haven't seen each other at all yet.

12:36.325 --> 12:38.118
l know!

12:38.287 --> 12:43.916
Let's meet tomorrow night on this very
spot as ourselves at eight o'clock.

12:46.595 --> 12:48.673
Don't you be a minute late.

13:00.496 --> 13:05.292
- Nice enough young person, Sam?
- Way to go, Cliffie!

13:05.463 --> 13:07.708
What do you mean?

13:07.884 --> 13:12.301
lf l didn't know you, l'd say that
you were pretty smooth tonight.

13:13.479 --> 13:17.397
Sam, l think l resent that a little bit.
Well, that's OK.

13:17.570 --> 13:21.405
You just think you know me
a lot better than you really do.

13:21.577 --> 13:24.831
Tonight wasn't really
all that unusual for me.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.918
- Come on, Cliff.
- No, really, it was commonplace.

13:30.052 --> 13:33.304
- What?
- OK, three, two, one...

13:33.475 --> 13:36.015
Hooray! l got a date!

13:43.619 --> 13:45.661
Thank you, Sam.

13:55.808 --> 13:57.719
Here we are.

13:57.896 --> 14:02.895
Yeah, thank you for the ride home
and thank you for the concert.

14:03.072 --> 14:05.779
That Gershwin's a genius.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.588
The mark of a great composer

14:16.765 --> 14:20.814
is when the audience leaves
humming your fireworks.

14:20.982 --> 14:24.234
- l had a great time.
- Me, too.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.612
l've not had such a good time since...

14:26.784 --> 14:30.121
l know when you stopped
having good times, Diane.

14:33.087 --> 14:38.632
lt goes without saying. l would have had
a better time if l had gone with Frasier.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.848
Me, too.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.263
Thanks for a lovely evening.

14:43.441 --> 14:50.445
How did you like our first outing with no
promise or threat of sexual encounter?

14:50.621 --> 14:53.578
You're not out that door yet.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.844
Good evening, everybody.

15:11.494 --> 15:15.577
- Can l have a beer, please, Coach?
- This one's on me, Coach.

15:17.672 --> 15:20.426
- Thank you, Norm.
- Cliffie...

15:22.640 --> 15:24.848
Well?

15:26.314 --> 15:28.354
Well, what?

15:29.444 --> 15:32.982
Last l saw,
you were dancing together.

15:33.160 --> 15:37.291
- Yeah, so?
- So...you know?

15:37.459 --> 15:40.213
No, Norm, l don't know.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.388
He wants to know if you boinked her,
you dink.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.057
Good God, Norm!

15:51.152 --> 15:55.402
Psychologists believe that one night
of meaningless pleasure

15:55.577 --> 15:57.987
can get in the way of commitment?

15:58.165 --> 16:01.419
- ls that true, Sam?
- l rely on it.

16:04.219 --> 16:07.424
She's meeting me here tonight
at eight o'clock.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.350
Eight o'clock. l don't believe this.

16:11.524 --> 16:15.572
You're meeting in 1 5 minutes.
l don't believe how calm you are.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.988
Don't tell me that you subscribe to that
myth about my discomfiture with women.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.957
l was here
when a woman asked you the time.

16:24.131 --> 16:27.717
You swallowed
the lower half of your face.

16:27.889 --> 16:30.845
You know nothing about body language.

16:31.019 --> 16:34.142
That gesture is replete
with erotic message.

16:34.318 --> 16:37.106
- To a baboon.
- All right.

16:37.281 --> 16:40.701
l admit that in the past
l've been shy around women,

16:40.871 --> 16:43.281
but l've been thinking about it

16:43.459 --> 16:48.125
and l don't think there's been
any real reason for my insecurity.

16:48.302 --> 16:53.597
As a matter of fact, watch this.
Sammy, lighter.

16:58.863 --> 17:00.988
May l?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.868
Thank you.

17:07.045 --> 17:09.205
You're very wel...

17:09.384 --> 17:13.171
l mean, you're welcome. You're...

17:14.978 --> 17:18.016
You're very extremely...

17:19.236 --> 17:21.361
You're...

17:27.251 --> 17:30.955
l think he's too damn smooth
for his own good.

17:39.566 --> 17:44.813
l'm such a wimp! l'm such a wuss.
l'm such a weenie! God, am l a dink!

17:44.993 --> 17:48.994
l know you're nervous,
but this one's different.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.753
- You danced with her.
- l didn't dance with her.

17:52.924 --> 17:55.548
- Ponce de Le贸n did.
- You did.

17:55.722 --> 17:58.048
l was just playing a role.

17:58.226 --> 18:04.150
- Tonight l'm me, a tongue-tied yutz.
- l want you to listen to me for a minute.

18:04.321 --> 18:08.987
There's been a lot of talk about you.
The one always defending you is me.

18:09.163 --> 18:13.711
That's what best friends are for.
But it's almost eight o'clock.

18:13.881 --> 18:18.048
The one woman weird enough for you
to have a shot at may be outside.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.428
You blow this,
l don't even want to look at you.

18:21.603 --> 18:25.936
Stop it, will you, Norm? Knock it off.

18:37.425 --> 18:39.835
OK, l'll go out there.

18:44.689 --> 18:48.393
Thanks. l love you, big guy!

18:48.571 --> 18:52.655
Give her a try first. lf it doesn't work out,
we can talk.

19:32.404 --> 19:36.192
lf she comes downstairs now
and sees you standing there,

19:36.370 --> 19:40.751
she'll know you've been there for six
hours. That looks desperate.

19:40.921 --> 19:42.961
So?

19:44.553 --> 19:48.339
That's the way it is, isn't it?
This is what love comes to.

19:48.518 --> 19:51.093
l want to remember this, Sammy.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.945
Somebody take my picture.

19:54.112 --> 19:56.866
Come on, Cliff. lt's on me.

19:57.034 --> 19:59.610
- Sit down.
- l guess you're right.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.710
No more illusions
about happiness for me.

20:02.878 --> 20:05.918
l'm going to drink myself into oblivion.

20:06.093 --> 20:11.340
No, you're not.
You'll just have two problems that way.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.974
Why did she stand me up? That does it.

20:15.152 --> 20:18.820
Now l'll let my grooming
and appearance go to hell.

20:18.993 --> 20:22.412
And you think
the results will be noticeable?

20:23.793 --> 20:27.414
Thank you, Carla.
l want abuse piled on me tonight.

20:27.592 --> 20:31.344
Maybe l'll get it through
my thick head that l'm a loser.

20:31.516 --> 20:34.140
You know what
my school nickname was?

20:34.313 --> 20:38.065
- No, you never told us.
- l didn't have one, Coach.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.409
l tried to get one started,
made it up myself.

20:43.747 --> 20:45.992
Courteous Cliff.

20:49.425 --> 20:55.054
- Couldn't you have done better?
- l didn't want to arouse suspicion.

20:58.693 --> 21:02.528
There's a tribe of men
in the Middle East called the Essenites.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.276
They're celibate
and live without women.

21:05.455 --> 21:09.041
Rumour has it that they are
the happiest men in the world.

21:09.212 --> 21:12.549
Tomorrow l'm going
to send for their brochure.

21:17.729 --> 21:22.276
Hello, Cheers.
No, there's no Ponce de Le贸n here.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.151
We don't have Prince Albert in the can.

21:27.330 --> 21:32.043
Coach. l think that might be for me.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.971
Hello? Yeah.

21:37.892 --> 21:41.395
Really? No, l understand.

21:41.566 --> 21:44.190
Yeah, l understand.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.774
OK. All right. Bye.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.918
lsn't that something?

21:54.089 --> 21:57.258
She was afraid to meet me
without her mask on.

21:58.973 --> 22:01.383
l actually made a woman nervous.

22:03.315 --> 22:05.559
That's incredible, isn't it?

22:05.736 --> 22:08.229
Are you two going get together?

22:08.408 --> 22:13.953
Yeah. She's at a pay phone across the
street. She said she's coming right over.

22:15.797 --> 22:18.884
- Cliffie, yeah?
- Let's not stand here.

22:19.053 --> 22:21.593
- We'll be up here.
- Come here.

22:23.144 --> 22:26.350
- Thank you.
- We don't want to have to eavesdrop.

22:26.526 --> 22:29.483
So keep your stupid remarks loud.

22:55.748 --> 22:59.452
