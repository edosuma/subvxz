00:18.328 --> 00:20.958
Previously on The Girlfriend Experience:

00:21.981 --> 00:24.231
What happened today with the guy?

00:24.275 --> 00:25.941
What guy?

00:25.985 --> 00:28.861
The guy that you were
talking to at the pool.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.030
Did you know him?

00:32.116 --> 00:33.157
No.

00:34.326 --> 00:37.244
He asked me if I was alone, I said no.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.080
Were you attracted to him?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.374
I forgot my phone.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.048
You'd loose your head...

00:50.342 --> 00:52.760
...if it wasn't screwed on.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.094
Take it in all the way.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.270
- Hello.
- Hey...

01:03.314 --> 01:04.480
I miss you already.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.273
How did you get this number?

01:06.317 --> 01:08.484
I didn't give you this number, Jack.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.695
Christine?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.405
Hey, I didn't hear from you
yesterday, and I got worried...

01:20.956 --> 01:24.166
I do not want you in
my fucking life, Jack.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.292
Do you understand?

01:25.336 --> 01:27.419
Never call me again!

01:40.267 --> 01:41.892
What's the status on those provisionals?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.018
You'll have them by the end of the day?

01:43.062 --> 01:44.311
Yes!

01:45.189 --> 01:46.271
I- I've got it under control.

01:46.857 --> 01:47.898
Okay.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.157
- Do you have multiple partners?
- Yes.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.368
Have you had unprotected
sex since your last exam?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.411
No.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.081
And when was your last Pap smear?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.541
Ahh, over a year ago.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.417
Okay.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.923
There's going to be a
little bit of pressure.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.466
So just try to relax.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.118
Miss Reade?

02:41.162 --> 02:43.495
- Hi, Ben.
- Uh, someone sent you these.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.420
Would you mind taking these
to my apartment for me?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.088
Sure.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.389
They say it's supposed
to rain this weekend.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.099
- Hmmm?
- The weather...

03:04.143 --> 03:05.392
It-It's supposed to rain.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.102
I heard that.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.322
Would you just wait while
I turn my lights on?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.364
Sure.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.105
- Thanks.
- Everything okay?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.273
Yeah, it's all good.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.234
Call down if you need anything.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.195
I will. Thanks, Ben.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.713
Living room's Camera One.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.424
The hallways are Camera Two.

05:42.468 --> 05:47.387
And the bedrooms are
Cameras Three and Four.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.515
It's set to record 24-7, unless
you program it otherwise.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.641
It's a one-week buffer.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.268
Got it.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.728
Thanks.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.564
I want to hear you talk
about the iron condors...

05:57.608 --> 06:02.402
Iron butterflies, fences,
collars, strangles and straddles.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.574
They make crunching numbers sound
sexier than it actually is.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.743
Quantitative analysis is...

06:10.329 --> 06:11.745
very boring.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.372
I think it's pretty hot.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.707
No, you don't.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.459
Okay, it's hot when you talk about it

06:17.503 --> 06:19.711
because you're obviously
good at your job.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.214
And that's a major turn on for me.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.510
Where did- Where'd you
learn those terms?

06:26.553 --> 06:30.263
Can't a girl have a stock
hobby, slash habit?

06:34.061 --> 06:36.436
I can talk you through where
to invest your money,

06:36.480 --> 06:38.480
if you're serious.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.773
I'm serious.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.276
That'd be great.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.695
My wife hates when I talk about work.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.828
Maybe that's why we're here.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.374
Do you want to um,

06:58.877 --> 07:00.085
Yes.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.840
I love that you ask me what I want,

07:04.883 --> 07:08.385
but I want to know what you want.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.388
I want to know what an
iron condor looks like.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.579
You want any more hot stock talk?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.373
Say that ten times fast.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.626
Hot stock talk, hot stock talk,
hot stock talk, hot stock talk...

07:43.714 --> 07:46.548
Bear call spread. Show me that.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.425
What do you really want?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.386
I want to ride your face.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.898
- Alex Peyton?
- Yes?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.860
My name is Simon Burcher.
I'm a private investigator.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.820
I have a few questions about
an acquaintance of yours.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.822
What's this about?

10:15.866 --> 10:18.700
I am investigating a woman
named Chelsea Rayne.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.913
Perhaps your wife knows her?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.839
This will only take a second.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.843
My wife has nothing to do with this.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.971
I'm very aware that your wife
has nothing to do with this.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.558
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.102
This gentleman just needs directions.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.688
My GPS got me all turned around.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.690
These streets, once you leave the city,

10:50.734 --> 10:51.775
always confuse me.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.736
I'll just get him back on the 90.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.862
Good luck.

10:55.906 --> 10:56.863
Sorry to bother you.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.156
Have a nice evening.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.702
She seems nice.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.169
Hand me your cell.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.057
How have you got her listed in here?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.559
Is there another way we can do this?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.561
I barely know her.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.772
You two seemed friendly enough.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.945
She's listed as...

11:36.988 --> 11:38.697
Donald Metcalf.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.742
I want an introduction.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.744
Tell her I'm a partner
in Bishop Burcher,

11:44.788 --> 11:46.037
an accounting firm here in town.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.163
Make it work.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.335
Hi, it's Chelsea.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.087
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.089
Hey, Chelsea, it's Alex.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.551
I just was talking about you with a
good friend mine, Simon Burcher,

11:59.594 --> 12:01.678
and he'd love to meet you.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.987
Can we make three copies of this
and send one to Tariq Barr?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.071
Thank you.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.072
Can you get Harrison on the phone?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.949
- Now?
- Right now.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.159
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.912
Yeah, could you get
Harrison on the phone?

12:33.128 --> 12:34.961
Hey.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.756
I'm working on Eisner Trading
and Arc Futures for Skip

12:37.799 --> 12:39.090
and I have to cross-reference
some of David's cases.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.133
Can I use your password?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.135
No.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.887
I have to get them into
Skip by the end of the day,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.221
and I need to make sure
they're not infringing.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.973
You're making your job
way too complicated.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.933
Just check the PTO website.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.144
But the files that I'm looking
for are patent applications.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.937
They're not gonna be in
public record for 18 months.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.773
Okay, why don't you just tell
me what you're looking for

12:54.816 --> 12:55.982
and I'll check?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.817
Kayla, we work for the same company.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.194
Not yet.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.780
Ten interns, two slots. Remember?

13:11.082 --> 13:13.082
- It's Alex.
- Hi, how are you?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.334
Good.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.002
I'm at a dinner meeting, what's up?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.837
Your friend, Simon, called me.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.590
I just wanted to touch base with
you before I called him back.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.176
How long have you known him?

13:23.220 --> 13:24.803
About five years.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.263
Yeah, that's right.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.849
He does tax prep for
us here at Rainsford.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.018
He's a great guy.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.146
A little quiet at first, but I
think you'll probably like him.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.211
Do you have any children?

14:40.255 --> 14:41.212
Two...

14:41.256 --> 14:42.255
A boy and a girl.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.215
Fifteen and thirteen.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.800
They live with their mother.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.927
It's good, it's amicable.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.054
We split up when they
were kids, and we've...

14:50.098 --> 14:52.640
figured things out over the years.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.688
So how am I doing for a first-timer?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.648
Am I passing the test?

15:00.692 --> 15:04.152
There's no test, we're just
seeing if we like each other.

15:04.863 --> 15:05.904
And?

15:06.823 --> 15:09.324
Well, what are you looking for?

15:09.367 --> 15:12.201
Just someone to spend some time with.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.203
I work a lot, so it can be
difficult to meet people,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.372
given my schedule.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.959
I don't have a lot of free
time, but of course...

15:20.003 --> 15:22.128
I'd make time to see you.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.047
How often were you thinking?

15:33.016 --> 15:34.307
Here they are.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.351
- Are they all clear?
- Yes, they're fine.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.937
I was just erring on
the side of caution.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.313
- Anything else?
- That's it.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.898
Great.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.489
David's furious.

15:49.532 --> 15:52.200
He wants me to deliver Erin all
supporting documentation for XHP,

15:52.243 --> 15:53.826
but I can't find all the files.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.995
They should be on the server.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.789
Unless someone deleted them.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.165
Well, they're not.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.334
Look, I know you worked on the case.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.752
Do you have any time to double-check

16:02.796 --> 16:03.962
and walk me through it?

16:04.005 --> 16:06.172
I'll need access to the files.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.174
I'll give you my password.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.343
But don't go behind my
back and make me look bad.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.929
Kayla, I'm on your side.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.222
It'll be fine.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.891
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:39.934 --> 17:40.975
Come on in.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.776
Here's your fee.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.029
It's $2,000 in cash, like
we discussed, you can...

17:53.073 --> 17:55.448
- Feel free to count it.
- Thanks.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.366
In twenty $100 bills.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.285
Great.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.163
Can I get you a drink?

18:03.041 --> 18:04.248
I'm fine, thanks.

18:38.159 --> 18:41.077
There's no reason to be nervous.
It's just you and me, okay?

18:41.121 --> 18:42.120
Yeah.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.416
What do you like?

18:48.378 --> 18:50.128
I don't know.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.423
It's hard for me to talk about.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.050
Maybe I'm not ready.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.386
It's okay.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.388
There's no rush.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.226
I want to...

19:07.438 --> 19:09.230
You can tell me.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.654
What are my choices?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.909
Tell me what my choices are.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.995
I want you to tell me.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.454
Well, I can...

19:27.333 --> 19:29.083
I can touch you.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.088
Do you like that? When
I touch your skin?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.174
Yeah.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.596
And here?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.058
Yeah.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.658
What else?

20:04.412 --> 20:06.329
I want to hear you say it.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.998
What are my choices?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.510
Would you give me a minute? I-I
have to take care of something

20:21.554 --> 20:23.638
before we, you know, continue.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.224
I'll be right back.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.393
Sure, okay.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.096
I'm not feeling well.
I'm-I'm gonna go home.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.681
Here. Uh, we can re-schedule.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.432
I can call you when I'm feeling better.

21:08.476 --> 21:09.558
Why don't you just lie
down for a little while?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.435
Maybe it'll pass.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.646
Just lie down for a minute. Maybe
you'll feel better. Really.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.231
I'm gonna go.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.440
I'll call you.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.070
I'm leaving your money on the table.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.449
Your call has been forwarded to

21:25.493 --> 21:27.451
an automated voice messaging system.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.161
Alex Peyton.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.664
At the tone, please record your message.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.750
Alex, this is Chelsea, I was
just with your friend, Simon.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.627
Can you please call me back?

21:36.671 --> 21:40.423
Tell me what my choices are.
I want you to tell me.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.467
Well, I...

21:45.388 --> 21:48.097
I can touch you.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.766
Do you like that when I touch your skin?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.393
Yeah.

21:55.398 --> 21:56.605
And here?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.484
Yeah.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.492
What else?

22:09.746 --> 22:12.371
But I want to hear you say it.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.998
What are my choices?

22:16.919 --> 22:19.128
Would you give me a minute?

22:19.172 --> 22:22.381
I just-I have to take care of somethig
before, we, you know, continue.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.841
I'll be right back.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.605
- Excuse me one sec.
- Sure.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.733
- Hello.
- It didn't work.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.151
Well, I don't know what to say.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.153
That's not going to cut it, Jacqueline.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.655
I gave her up to you. I don't
know what else I can do.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.990
Well, you better hope that she caves,

22:48.034 --> 22:49.742
otherwise, I'm coming after you.
Do you understand?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.779
Chelsea! Hi, it's Simon Burcher.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.239
Uh, I hope you're feeling better.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.408
Uh, listen, I'd love to see you again.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.618
The sooner the better.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.246
Hopefully, I won't make
your stomach turn again.

23:35.289 --> 23:39.625
Ahh, anyway, call me, 312...

24:12.702 --> 24:14.285
You wanna share a cab?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.038
It's already ten?

24:18.082 --> 24:20.249
Did you have a chance to look at XHP?

24:20.293 --> 24:21.792
There are files missing.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.711
But we'll find them. I
just need another day.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.045
Okay.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.717
So you wanna share a cab?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.051
Well I can't leave yet. I
still have too much work.

24:31.721 --> 24:32.928
Alright...

24:32.972 --> 24:34.972
See you tomorrow. Don't worry.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.724
Thanks.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.033
Christine?

24:55.786 --> 24:56.911
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.329
I just want to talk.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.540
Who the fuck are you?

25:01.584 --> 25:02.791
What do you want?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.627
Tomorrow, you're gonna
to call Peter Gramercy,

25:04.670 --> 25:06.837
or have a lawyer call Peter Gramercy,

25:06.881 --> 25:08.672
and you're gonna tell him
that you're disclaiming

25:08.716 --> 25:10.716
any and all interests in
Michael Cilic's estate.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.052
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.679
What does matter is that
I know who you are.

25:15.723 --> 25:19.892
Christine Reade. Born June 27th, 1989,

25:19.936 --> 25:22.061
at Mercy Hospital in Philadelphia.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.064
Your parents are James and Mary Reade,
they're both high school teachers,

25:25.107 --> 25:26.649
and you have one sibling,

25:26.692 --> 25:28.734
an elder sister, Annabel,

25:28.778 --> 25:31.779

Arlington County, Virginia.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.365
You're a 2nd-year law
student at Chicago-Burnham,

25:34.408 --> 25:36.575
and you intern here on the 39th floor

25:36.619 --> 25:38.577

25:38.621 --> 25:39.620
Do you want me to continue?

25:40.957 --> 25:42.790
I didn't think so.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.542
Now...

25:44.585 --> 25:47.836
If you don't make this call,

25:47.880 --> 25:50.756
everyone will find out what
you really do for a living.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.677
Your friends, your family,
your law professors.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.138
Am I clear?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.808
Good.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.644
Have a good night.
