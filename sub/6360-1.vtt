01:47.116 --> 01:48.534
I'll take him.

02:19.440 --> 02:24.195
<i>Jimmy MacElroy. The crowd swooning</i>
<i>as he comes out of that spin flawlessly.</i>

02:24.821 --> 02:28.247
<i>They are giving him the love</i>
<i>and he is giving it right back.</i>

02:33.538 --> 02:35.206
<i>Here it comes.</i>

02:35.331 --> 02:37.208
<i>And he nails it!</i>

02:40.253 --> 02:41.921
It's the best he's been.

02:44.382 --> 02:46.217
<i>Now there's the arm.</i>

02:46.759 --> 02:48.136
<i>And you know what that means.</i>

02:48.261 --> 02:51.472
<i>Yes. The galloping peacock.</i>
<i>And look at him getting air on that.</i>

02:51.598 --> 02:54.726
<i>Flawless. Just textbook perfection.</i>

02:56.936 --> 02:59.647
<i>There are very few women</i>
<i>in the history of this sport</i>

02:59.772 --> 03:01.983
<i>that skate with this kind of beauty.</i>

03:02.442 --> 03:04.444
Come on, Jimmy. Nail it!

03:07.071 --> 03:10.158
<i>Ending the programme</i>
<i>showing his flexibility.</i>

03:11.326 --> 03:13.411
<i>What a great effort!</i>

03:18.750 --> 03:20.501
<i>He couldn't skate any better than that.</i>

03:20.627 --> 03:23.338
<i>The performance of a lifetime,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy!</i>

03:23.463 --> 03:25.965
<i>Elegant with</i>
<i>machine-like technical precision.</i>

03:26.090 --> 03:27.091
<i>And there it is.</i>

03:27.217 --> 03:30.845
<i>So important to remember that</i>
<i>that dove was in his suit the whole time.</i>

03:30.970 --> 03:33.181
<i>Jimmy's renowned</i>
<i>for his personal hygiene, Scott.</i>

03:33.306 --> 03:36.017
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

03:36.017 --> 03:36.351
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

03:36.476 --> 03:38.269
<i>While the judges decide Jimmy's fate,</i>

03:38.394 --> 03:40.980
<i>let's take a look</i>
<i>at this exceptional young skater.</i>

03:41.814 --> 03:43.483
<i>He is a child of privilege.</i>

03:43.608 --> 03:46.277
<i>A classic skater defined</i>
<i>by elegance, precision</i>

03:46.402 --> 03:48.613
<i>and an ability to endure great pain.</i>

03:48.988 --> 03:50.990
<i>He was plucked from an orphanage</i>
<i>at age four</i>

03:51.115 --> 03:53.701
<i>by billionaire champion-maker,</i>
<i>Darren MacElroy.</i>

03:54.118 --> 03:57.205
<i>Once a breeder of some of the most</i>
<i>successful racehorses in the world,</i>

03:57.330 --> 03:58.498
<i>Darren had turned his attention</i>

03:58.623 --> 04:01.376
<i>to nurturing athletically advanced</i>
<i>human orphans.</i>

04:01.501 --> 04:05.797
<i>His ultimate find came in the form</i>
<i>of skating wunderkind, Jimmy.</i>

04:05.922 --> 04:08.383
I guess I had a pretty normal childhood.

04:09.008 --> 04:10.468
<i>With his father's state of the art,</i>

04:10.593 --> 04:12.971
<i>some say questionable,</i>
<i>training methods,</i>

04:13.096 --> 04:17.225
<i>this child prodigy</i>
<i>was forged into an Ã¼ber skater.</i>

04:18.726 --> 04:20.310
<i>Soon, Jimmy was sweeping the gold</i>

04:20.435 --> 04:23.356
<i>while his trademark Jimmy curl</i>
<i>was sweeping the nation,</i>

04:23.481 --> 04:26.859
<i>with kids of all ages fashion drafting</i>
<i>right behind their idol.</i>

04:26.985 --> 04:29.279
<i>A champion, an icon, a giver.</i>

04:29.654 --> 04:33.283
<i>Jimmy MacElroy,</i>
<i>skating's Little Orphan Awesome.</i>

04:36.327 --> 04:38.871
- Well, Coach?
- You nailed it, Jimmy. You nailed it.

04:38.997 --> 04:41.624
You nailed it shut.
Every move exactly like I showed you.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.251
I am so proud of you.

04:43.376 --> 04:45.837
Thanks. Dad, what'd you think?

04:45.962 --> 04:48.548
Decided on our own to do
a little flourish off the triple, did we?

04:48.673 --> 04:50.925
Look, I knew I had it.
I just felt like it needed a little...

04:51.050 --> 04:54.679
Feeling? We're feeling now?
What are you teaching this boy?

04:54.804 --> 04:55.847
Jimmy!

04:55.972 --> 05:00.018
I sent you a cup of my blood!
Did you get my blood? Jimmy!

05:00.143 --> 05:02.061
Please don't encourage them. Come on.

05:02.186 --> 05:03.229
Move!

05:03.354 --> 05:04.731
They may look cute and innocent
but they're nothing

05:04.856 --> 05:06.649
but a beehive for germs and bacteria.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.069
- Remember the slides I showed you?
- But they're beautiful.

05:10.653 --> 05:13.239
You smell like a winner!
You want to smell like...

05:13.364 --> 05:14.949
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Jimmy!

05:15.074 --> 05:16.618
- I'll call you!
<i>...the judges' scores are:</i>

05:16.743 --> 05:21.789
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0,</i>

05:21.915 --> 05:26.210
<i>5.9, 6.0, 5.8.</i>

05:26.336 --> 05:29.005
All right, not bad, not bad.
As long as that 5.8 doesn't kill us.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.381
Hands.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.383
Skittles.

05:34.469 --> 05:37.472
Hey, MacElroy. Was that your routine?

05:37.597 --> 05:40.391
Or a performance
of Cirque du So-lame?

05:40.516 --> 05:41.517
Besides, you're too late.

05:41.643 --> 05:43.311
They already handed out
the girls' medals this morning.

05:43.436 --> 05:44.479
Shut up, Michaels.

05:44.604 --> 05:48.316
That was textbook execution.
Same scores I beat you with in Oslo.

05:48.441 --> 05:51.027
I was on Quaaludes.
I don't even remember Oslo.

05:51.152 --> 05:52.528
But I remember Boston,

05:52.654 --> 05:54.656
and that victory was
as sweet as the cream pie

05:54.781 --> 05:56.282
for which the town was named.

05:59.369 --> 06:02.914
Step aside, home school.
There's a new sheriff in town.

06:04.749 --> 06:05.917
Chazz!

06:10.672 --> 06:14.384
<i>There he is. Skating's outlaw,</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

06:19.055 --> 06:23.977
<i>This cowboy is cracking his whip on the</i>
<i>haunch of this crowd, and they love it!</i>

06:28.314 --> 06:31.109
<i>How do you describe</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

06:34.737 --> 06:39.951
<i>He just uses everything at his disposal.</i>
<i>The movement, the music.</i>

06:43.371 --> 06:45.915
<i>And he just nails the triple Axel!</i>

06:48.543 --> 06:50.670
<i>Surfing a tsunami of swagger right now.</i>

06:50.795 --> 06:53.548
<i>Well, you know he is sex on ice.</i>

07:04.267 --> 07:08.479
<i>Hello, ladies. Typical of Michaels,</i>
<i>it's not enough just to win.</i>

07:08.605 --> 07:11.190
<i>He wants to make love to the crowd.</i>

07:13.693 --> 07:15.361
<i>That's why those seats are so valuable.</i>

07:15.486 --> 07:18.364
<i>That's what they want</i>
<i>from Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

07:27.916 --> 07:31.169
<i>Michaels just slipped MacElroy</i>
<i>a very public note.</i>

07:31.294 --> 07:33.671
<i>You have been called out, sir.</i>

07:42.013 --> 07:43.473
You're welcome, Stockholm.

07:43.598 --> 07:46.100
<i>Unreal. An instant classic.</i>

07:46.226 --> 07:48.061
<i>Just when you think you've seen it all,</i>

07:48.186 --> 07:51.648
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels walks in</i>
<i>with the unrated version.</i>

07:51.773 --> 07:55.026
<i>The undefeatable underdog,</i>
<i>ice skating's backdoor lover,</i>

07:55.151 --> 07:58.279
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels has come</i>
<i>in here and captivated this arena</i>

07:58.404 --> 08:00.615
like a stack of classic Euro porn.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.659
<i>And so while his scores</i>
<i>are being tabulated,</i>

08:02.784 --> 08:06.537
<i>let's learn a little bit more</i>
<i>about skating's Leather-clad Lothario.</i>

08:08.623 --> 08:12.669
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>
<i>an ice-devouring sex tornado.</i>

08:12.794 --> 08:15.004
<i>Spawned in the hell-fires of Motown.</i>

08:15.129 --> 08:16.214
<i>Troubled childhood?</i>

08:16.464 --> 08:20.468
If you call being a nine-year-old kid
with a 35-year-old girlfriend troubled.

08:20.593 --> 08:24.430
<i>At age 12, Chazz escaped a life of</i>
<i>running cigarettes and illegal fireworks</i>

08:24.556 --> 08:28.935
<i>by becoming a star in Detroit's</i>
<i>underground sewer skating scene.</i>

08:29.102 --> 08:32.938
<i>The only skater to win four national</i>
<i>championships and an adult film award,</i>

08:33.063 --> 08:37.360
<i>which is not to say this rough-hewn</i>
<i>heartthrob doesn't have a softer side.</i>

08:37.485 --> 08:41.155
<i>He recently published a book of poetry,</i>
Let Me Put My Poems in You.

08:41.447 --> 08:43.700
Before a big competition,
I like to work with leather.

08:43.825 --> 08:45.994
The Native Americans always said

08:46.119 --> 08:48.997
that working with hides and pelts
releases the soul.

08:49.122 --> 08:51.583
These are a couple of diaper bags
I made for Faith Hill.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.627
<i>Two men, only one winner.</i>

08:54.752 --> 08:57.088
<i>Will it be Chazz Michael Michaels?</i>

08:57.213 --> 09:00.008
Personal philosophy: Clothing optional.

09:02.552 --> 09:05.638
Hope you brought your silver polish,
MacElroy, 'cause that was gold.

09:05.763 --> 09:07.140
That was disgusting.

09:07.265 --> 09:09.267
That, young man,
is how babies are made.

09:09.392 --> 09:11.686
- Get out of my face.
- I'll get inside your face.

09:11.811 --> 09:12.854
Mr Michael Michaels,

09:12.979 --> 09:14.856
please gather your coach,
family, and friends

09:14.981 --> 09:16.858
and move to the bench
to await your scores.

09:16.983 --> 09:20.069
Hey, traffic cop. Get this straight.
I don't have a coach. I don't need one.

09:20.194 --> 09:24.157
And as for friends and family,
Chazz Michael Michaels walks alone.

09:24.282 --> 09:27.911
That's why they call me the Lone Wolf,
on my back there.

09:28.036 --> 09:32.790
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0...</i>

09:32.916 --> 09:34.125
That's what I'm talking about.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.878
<i>5.9, 6.0...</i>

09:37.003 --> 09:38.546
Another 6.0.

09:38.671 --> 09:39.839
<i>... 5.8.</i>

09:39.964 --> 09:41.424
Was it good for you, Stockholm?

09:41.549 --> 09:44.219
'Cause it was good for me.
Let's have a smoke.

09:44.677 --> 09:45.762
Eat that, MacElroy.

09:45.887 --> 09:48.723
Those were the same scores
I got, Einstein. We're tied.

09:48.848 --> 09:51.893
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, we have a tie.</i>
- You're high.

09:52.018 --> 09:54.187
<i>From the United States,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>

09:54.312 --> 09:57.232
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

09:59.567 --> 10:01.027
You're fired.

10:01.152 --> 10:03.112
What? I brought you a gold medal.

10:03.238 --> 10:04.739
No, you brought me half a gold medal.

10:04.864 --> 10:08.618
If I wanted him to share,
I'd have bought him a brother.

10:08.743 --> 10:12.372
<i>It's raining men in the men's singles.</i>
<i>Men wearing gold, that is.</i>

10:12.497 --> 10:15.792
<i>And they join Team USA's</i>
<i>other gold medallists,</i>

10:15.917 --> 10:18.920
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

10:20.171 --> 10:22.882
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg,</i>

10:23.007 --> 10:25.802
<i>America's brother and sister darlings,</i>

10:25.927 --> 10:29.013
<i>the gold standard</i>
<i>of pairs figure skating.</i>

10:29.472 --> 10:31.891
<i>Children of</i>
<i>beloved Swiss skiing gold medallists,</i>

10:32.016 --> 10:33.810
<i>Otto and Ella Van Waldenberg,</i>

10:33.935 --> 10:38.773
<i>the twin dynamos Stranz and Fairchild</i>
<i>burst out of the womb and onto the ice</i>

10:38.898 --> 10:41.776
<i>while their sister, Katie,</i>
<i>cheered from the sidelines.</i>

10:41.901 --> 10:46.948
<i>Theirs seemed to be a charmed life</i>
<i>until March 14th, 1987</i>

10:47.574 --> 10:50.368
<i>when their parents died tragically</i>
<i>in a car crash.</i>

10:50.577 --> 10:52.161
<i>Katie would survive.</i>

10:52.287 --> 10:55.456
<i>The world wondered, had Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild gone into a layback spin</i>

10:55.582 --> 10:57.458
<i>from which they could never recover?</i>

10:57.584 --> 10:59.085
<i>But the siblings' commitment was such</i>

10:59.210 --> 11:02.463
<i>that they were back in the training rink</i>
<i>within hours of the funeral.</i>

11:02.589 --> 11:05.717
<i>So tonight, the crowd cheers</i>
<i>on their beloved Van Waldenbergs.</i>

11:05.842 --> 11:07.343
<i>Well, Stranz and Fairchild,</i>

11:07.468 --> 11:09.554
<i>how heavy is that gold</i>
<i>around your necks?</i>

11:09.679 --> 11:13.558
Scott, this may be solid gold
but to us it's lighter than air

11:13.683 --> 11:15.602
because dreams never weigh you down.

11:15.727 --> 11:17.604
No. Dreams are in your sleep.

11:17.729 --> 11:20.607
<i>What about the amazing</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy?</i>

11:20.732 --> 11:22.233
<i>Two gold medals?</i>

11:22.358 --> 11:25.236
Yeah. That's great.

11:25.361 --> 11:26.571
<i>Well, speaking of gold medals,</i>

11:26.696 --> 11:27.780
<i>the winners of the men's singles</i>

11:27.906 --> 11:31.075
<i>are taking their place</i>
<i>at the podium right now.</i>

11:37.498 --> 11:40.251
<i>This has to be a proud moment</i>
<i>for Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

11:40.376 --> 11:43.004
<i>You have to think, the only thing</i>
<i>sweeter than winning a gold medal</i>

11:43.129 --> 11:45.340
<i>is sharing it</i>
<i>with your fellow countryman.</i>

11:45.465 --> 11:46.507
Gosh, I'm getting sick.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.259
You smell like
aftershave and taco meat.

11:48.384 --> 11:51.012
Yes, I do. Now scoot over.

11:51.137 --> 11:53.348
Don't touch me. Nobody touches me.

11:53.473 --> 11:54.974
- Just scoot over, man.
- Don't.

11:55.099 --> 11:56.434
- Just scoot over.
- You scoot over.

11:56.559 --> 11:58.311
<i>Now there's some jostling</i>
<i>atop the podium</i>

11:58.436 --> 12:01.022
<i>and down goes</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

12:01.564 --> 12:03.691
<i>MacElroy still waving to the crowd.</i>

12:04.108 --> 12:06.069
<i>Look, MacElroy's also down now.</i>

12:06.194 --> 12:08.321
<i>I have never in all my years</i>
<i>seen anything</i>

12:08.446 --> 12:10.281
<i>this disgraceful on the world stage.</i>

12:10.406 --> 12:12.992
<i>I am stunned silent,</i>
<i>absolutely silent, Jim.</i>

12:13.117 --> 12:15.662
You get that damned bird out of my face
before I break its neck.

12:15.787 --> 12:18.122
<i>A perfect head butt!</i>
<i>Down goes MacElroy!</i>

12:18.248 --> 12:20.124
<i>And Spaetzle's aflame!</i>

12:21.042 --> 12:23.336
<i>Spaetzle! Oh, my God!</i>

12:41.020 --> 12:43.815
<i>As we prepare to hear testimony,</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>

12:43.940 --> 12:47.443
<i>will be given a chance</i>
<i>to defend their actions at Stockholm...</i>

12:53.866 --> 12:55.493
We love you, Jimmy.

12:57.245 --> 12:59.789
Hey. Nancy Kerrigan.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.084
You an official here?

13:03.209 --> 13:06.212
'Cause you have officially given me
a boner.

13:07.839 --> 13:11.092
I'm a sex addict. It's my cross to bear.

13:12.510 --> 13:16.514
It's a real disease with doctors
and medicine and everything.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.100
Let's get started, shall we?

13:19.225 --> 13:21.185
If either one of you would like
to make a statement

13:21.311 --> 13:23.813
before the commission
passes judgement,

13:23.938 --> 13:26.107
you may do so at this time.

13:28.026 --> 13:31.863
Fans, friends, esteemed members
of the committee,

13:32.530 --> 13:33.990
I don't know what I can say,

13:34.407 --> 13:36.367
but I pray you can all forgive me.

13:37.201 --> 13:40.079
More than that,
I pray the children can forgive me.

13:40.204 --> 13:41.289
Oh, my God.

13:41.414 --> 13:44.083
- I place my future in their tiny hands.
- That is retarded.

13:44.208 --> 13:48.171
God bless you. God bless everyone.
Thank you.

13:49.505 --> 13:52.050
God bless you, Jimmy.
God bless your heart.

13:54.427 --> 13:55.595

is figure skating."

14:01.893 --> 14:03.061
Boom!

14:06.856 --> 14:08.900
All right, duly noted.

14:09.025 --> 14:13.696
In accordance with the rules of
the International Skating Federation,

14:13.821 --> 14:17.659
James MacElroy
and Charles Michael Michaels,

14:17.784 --> 14:19.994
you are to be stripped of your medals...

14:20.119 --> 14:21.162
What?

14:21.287 --> 14:25.250
...and banned from men's figure skating
for the remainder of your lives!

14:25.375 --> 14:27.502
Hey, you listen to me, old man!

14:28.461 --> 14:29.671
Oh, that sucks.

14:29.796 --> 14:31.297
Look what you did to my ex-wife!

14:31.422 --> 14:33.383
I'm gonna pop you
in the back of the head.

14:36.636 --> 14:39.264
Banned for life. That's a long time.

14:40.473 --> 14:44.018
Jimmy, it'll all work out.

14:44.143 --> 14:45.228
It's time for a fresh start.

14:45.353 --> 14:48.314
- Yeah, a fresh start. Exactly.
- Good. Jimmy,

14:50.567 --> 14:53.319
- I'm un-adopting you.
- What?

14:53.444 --> 14:54.946
I don't think un-adopting
is the right word.

14:55.071 --> 14:57.407
Legally, I'm disowning you.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.659
But it amounts to the same thing, so...

14:59.784 --> 15:01.869
But I've been your son for 26 years.

15:01.995 --> 15:04.956
Twenty-two, so nobody can say
I didn't try. We've had a good run.

15:05.081 --> 15:09.502
Now, I think it would be best for all of us
if we didn't drag this out. Clean break.

15:14.048 --> 15:16.718
It would make it easier for me, Jimmy,
if you left now.

15:16.843 --> 15:17.886
Wait!

15:18.011 --> 15:22.181
It's like a Band-Aid. Just rip it off.
We'll both feel better.

15:54.672 --> 15:57.508
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>get your tickets for the second show.</i>

15:58.218 --> 16:01.596
<i>Second show tickets now available.</i>

16:01.721 --> 16:07.101
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>We sing a grublet song</i>

16:07.227 --> 16:13.399
<i>We love to roam our woodsy home</i>
<i>Of greenery and scenery and song</i>

16:13.524 --> 16:18.154
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>A grublet sings along</i>

16:18.279 --> 16:19.697
Oh, God.

16:24.410 --> 16:25.912
I hate you.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.001
I hate my life.

16:32.126 --> 16:34.337
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

16:35.129 --> 16:36.256
Boo!

16:49.602 --> 16:53.481
I mean, I had it with skating
for the judges, you know?

16:53.606 --> 16:55.525
Just like, I don't need that.

16:55.650 --> 17:00.196
I mean, for me, it's so much
more satisfying to see the...

17:00.321 --> 17:03.783
The eyes of a small child,
seeing that wonder as they...

17:03.908 --> 17:07.537
They see you skate out there
with a big wizard head on, you know?

17:09.747 --> 17:11.499
Nice. Really nice.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.836
Hey, Sammy, it's not what it looks like.

17:18.339 --> 17:20.758
Sam. Sammy, come on, baby.

17:20.884 --> 17:22.969
You knew this was how I rolled
when you met me.

17:23.094 --> 17:25.637
No. When I met you,
you were a great figure skater.

17:25.762 --> 17:27.848
Now you're getting stoned
with the Woodland Fairies.

17:27.973 --> 17:29.350
I don't even know
who you are any more.

17:29.475 --> 17:30.894
You're living in the past, Sammy.

17:31.019 --> 17:32.270
Come on,
me and the Woodland Fairies,

17:32.395 --> 17:34.230
we're living in the here and now.

17:34.355 --> 17:36.941
And we're feeling so free.
Come on, join us.

17:38.860 --> 17:40.904
Baby. Come on, babe.

17:41.029 --> 17:44.616
Hey, Michaels, let's go. Lace up.
The fog machines are primed.

17:44.741 --> 17:47.201
Second show's
almost three-quarters full.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.662
- You drunk?
- No.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.373
But this ought to do it.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.251
I would fire you

17:56.169 --> 17:58.838
if you weren't so goddamn beautiful
out there.

17:59.839 --> 18:02.175
- You smell like urine.
- A lot?

18:02.884 --> 18:04.510
Get your head on.

18:10.475 --> 18:12.101
They don't feel right.

18:12.227 --> 18:13.728
That's because I'm not finished.

18:13.853 --> 18:17.523
You see, it helps to think of the laces
as belonging to three distinct groups.

18:17.649 --> 18:19.234
First, the foundation.

18:19.734 --> 18:21.027
They're too tight.

18:21.152 --> 18:23.488
Daddy! He's crushing me.

18:23.613 --> 18:25.907
Doing it right takes a little bit longer,
but it's worth it.

18:26.032 --> 18:29.244
Hey, what are you doing?
She said it's too tight.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.912
Well, but she's wrong.

18:31.037 --> 18:35.250
I mean, who are you gonna trust,
a little girl or Jimmy MacElroy?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.627
- Who the hell is Jimmy MacElroy?
- Is there a problem here, sir?

18:37.752 --> 18:40.129
Yeah, this kid is torturing
my daughter's foot.

18:40.255 --> 18:41.381
I'm so sorry, sir.

18:41.506 --> 18:45.885
You know what, Jimmy? Off the skates,
you're on stockroom duty, now. Let's go.

18:55.812 --> 18:57.230
Hey, Jimmy.

18:57.855 --> 18:59.107
Hector?

18:59.232 --> 19:00.441
What are you doing here?

19:00.567 --> 19:03.361
You know
I have a restraining order against you.

19:04.195 --> 19:05.738
Oh, that thing?

19:06.114 --> 19:09.909
You look great, Jimmy.
You look amazing. Your hair rocks.

19:10.034 --> 19:11.077
Thanks.

19:11.202 --> 19:13.663
You look so good. Oh, my gosh.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.999
Do you look at yourself?

19:16.124 --> 19:20.920
I totally wanna cut off your skin and
wear it to my birthday. It's coming up.

19:21.045 --> 19:25.341
Yeah, listen, it's great to see you,
Hector, but I'm really busy right now.

19:25.466 --> 19:27.802
Okay, all right, I'm sorry.
I'll cut to the chase.

19:27.927 --> 19:30.179
- You gotta start skating again, Jimmy.
- What?

19:30.305 --> 19:32.932
It's embarrassing stalking a has-been,
you know what I mean?

19:33.057 --> 19:34.767
Look, I almost gave up on you.

19:34.893 --> 19:36.311
I started working
with that Ukrainian skater,

19:36.436 --> 19:37.979
you know the one that looks like Elvis?

19:38.104 --> 19:39.355
And I moved to the Ukraine

19:39.480 --> 19:42.692
and it was cold and everyone had guns
and smelled like soup.

19:42.817 --> 19:46.946
I sympathise with you, Hector.
I really do, but there's nothing I can do.

19:47.071 --> 19:48.239
I'm banned for life.

19:48.364 --> 19:50.074
Don't be so sure.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.369
Section 14, paragraph G,

19:53.494 --> 19:57.290
"A lifetime ban is irrevocable
and the banned skater can never again

19:57.415 --> 19:59.876
"compete in any
Federation-sanctioned tournament

20:00.001 --> 20:02.712
"that exists in such a skater's division."

20:03.630 --> 20:08.384
You see? You're only banned
from your division, men's singles!

20:08.968 --> 20:12.138
You can still compete in pairs skating.

20:12.263 --> 20:13.806
Pairs.

20:19.103 --> 20:20.688
How is this possible?

20:20.813 --> 20:24.150
I had so many lawyers work on
so many appeals.

20:24.275 --> 20:26.945
Because nobody can obsess like I can.

20:28.029 --> 20:29.697
Good luck, Jimmy.

20:32.992 --> 20:35.703
And I'm still gonna kill you someday.

20:41.334 --> 20:44.379
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

20:53.429 --> 20:56.015
<i>Hey, little forest creatures.</i>

20:56.140 --> 20:59.978
<i>None of you sons-of-bitches</i>
<i>try to be heroes. You hear me?</i>

21:02.605 --> 21:05.191
Hey, Chazz. Come on.

21:06.317 --> 21:08.111
It's Gary. What are you doing?

21:08.236 --> 21:10.863
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>
<i>This is Gary, the squirrel.</i>

21:10.989 --> 21:13.116
<i>Now listen up.</i>
<i>Gary's been a long-time friend.</i>

21:13.241 --> 21:16.119
<i>We've been skating</i>
<i>for two and a half years.</i>

21:16.244 --> 21:20.123
<i>I remember when we were hanging out</i>
<i>at the bus stop in Tucson,</i>

21:20.248 --> 21:22.625
<i>and Gary said, "I've got a third ball."</i>

21:24.294 --> 21:27.547
<i>Damn it. I just threw up in here, people.</i>

21:28.631 --> 21:32.010
<i>That's the reality.</i>
<i>Another layer to the legend.</i>

21:32.135 --> 21:36.848
<i>I am nothing but a human onion.</i>
<i>In fact, we all are. Oh, encore.</i>

21:38.391 --> 21:42.103
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> Grublets on Ice
<i>will be cancelled until further notice.</i>

21:42.228 --> 21:44.272
<i>No refunds will be given.</i>

21:47.859 --> 21:51.738
Bring it on! Let it rain down on me.

21:56.409 --> 21:59.621
There's a loophole. I was banned
from men's singles but not pairs.

21:59.746 --> 22:01.623
I can skate
in the Wintersport Games again.

22:01.748 --> 22:04.709
I knew it. I knew after three years,
you just weren't checking in.

22:04.834 --> 22:07.212
I mean, come on, I moved on, Jimmy.
You gotta move on, too.

22:07.337 --> 22:09.339
But I'm a skater.
There's nothing to move on to,

22:09.464 --> 22:12.258
except for winning the gold again
and keeping it this time.

22:12.383 --> 22:14.636
You know how hard it is
to find a partner?

22:14.761 --> 22:17.055
Even if you did,
you gotta qualify for Nationals.

22:17.180 --> 22:18.640
That's a month away.

22:18.765 --> 22:20.350
I mean, sign-up is in two days.

22:20.475 --> 22:21.893
It can't be that hard. I mean...

22:22.018 --> 22:26.898
Figure skating. Give it up, Jimmy.
It's like a cruel bitch mother.

22:27.690 --> 22:30.485
She'll seduce you
with chocolates and roses

22:30.610 --> 22:34.113
and then kick you to the side of the road
like a dead raccoon.

22:34.906 --> 22:36.866
Forget it. I gotta go.

22:38.534 --> 22:40.370
It's good to see you.

22:41.871 --> 22:43.498
Wait, Coach!

23:03.226 --> 23:04.769
Jimmy MacElroy?

23:05.353 --> 23:08.523
Another great walking through the halls
of the Grublets.

23:09.065 --> 23:11.234
Welcome to my little production.

23:11.359 --> 23:13.861
If you're here to thank me for firing
Chazz Michaels, it was my pleasure.

23:13.987 --> 23:15.029
Chazz was here?

23:15.154 --> 23:19.450
Yeah, unfortunately,
but it's fantastic that you're here.

23:19.576 --> 23:22.996
And yes, no need to ask,
I'll consider you for a position.

23:23.121 --> 23:24.831
I'm not looking for a job.

23:24.956 --> 23:28.293
I'm actually looking for a female skater
to compete with me at Nationals.

23:28.418 --> 23:30.920
- Are you trying to skater poach?
- No.

23:31.045 --> 23:33.006
You trying to break up my family?

23:33.131 --> 23:36.467
Why don't you get out of here
before I throw down?

23:40.305 --> 23:41.681
Hey, where you going?

23:57.071 --> 23:58.072
Michaels.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.074
MacElroy.

24:00.199 --> 24:01.367
I see you got fat.

24:01.492 --> 24:03.411
I see you still look
like a 15-year-old girl but not hot.

24:03.536 --> 24:04.579
You crushed my dreams.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.414
Dreams? Shit.
I haven't had one of those in years.

24:06.539 --> 24:09.083
Zip it, Chazz. Zip it or I will punch you
in your crap lousy face.

24:09.209 --> 24:10.376
This ends tonight.

24:10.501 --> 24:12.545
It's daytime, you douche.

24:14.797 --> 24:17.008
- Now it's on!
- You're so fat!

24:22.931 --> 24:25.767
<i>Local figure skating fans got more than</i>
<i>they bargained for today</i>

24:25.892 --> 24:28.853
<i>when a children's ice show</i>
<i>was interrupted by a street fight</i>

24:28.978 --> 24:31.064
<i>between two former champions.</i>

24:31.189 --> 24:33.358
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>

24:33.483 --> 24:35.151
<i>once at the top of the skating world,</i>

24:35.276 --> 24:38.696
<i>picked up today where they left off</i>
<i>more than three years...</i>

24:55.797 --> 24:58.383
<i>Fans remember Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>as gold medallists who,</i>

24:58.508 --> 25:00.051
<i>in a bizarre turn of events,</i>

25:00.176 --> 25:02.554
<i>became banned from competition</i>
<i>for life.</i>

25:02.679 --> 25:03.972
<i>I had a chance to sit down</i>
<i>with Michaels</i>

25:04.097 --> 25:06.015
<i>and let's just say, he's a complex man.</i>

25:06.140 --> 25:09.102
<i>I'm a sex addict</i>
<i>and I'm attracted to women.</i>

25:28.454 --> 25:32.667
Two men skating together?
That's a riot. That's a laugh riot.

25:32.792 --> 25:36.129
- I don't see what's so funny.
- If you were as drunk as me, you would.

25:36.254 --> 25:40.049
Look, Coach, I know I said
I wanted to skate pairs, but two men?

25:40.174 --> 25:42.260
Even if we wanted to,
they'd never allow it.

25:42.385 --> 25:44.512
But there's nothing in the rule book
that says you can't.

25:44.637 --> 25:48.558
That's not my style.
Chazz Michael Michaels goes it alone.

25:48.683 --> 25:52.061
Okay?
That means no coach and no partner.

25:53.104 --> 25:55.315
Especially not a dude.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.234
Especially not the precious
and pampered Richie Rich.

25:58.359 --> 26:00.403
Would you just shut up? You don't know
what you're talking about.

26:00.528 --> 26:01.529
I know more than you think I know.

26:01.654 --> 26:03.239
Hell, I know more than you know
you know.

26:03.364 --> 26:05.783
No, you don't. You could never keep up
with my flawless technique.

26:05.909 --> 26:08.202
That's why I floored you in '02
and the spring of '99.

26:08.328 --> 26:09.829
Technique doesn't get you 18 medals

26:09.954 --> 26:12.040
and a Kristi Yamaguchi
Lifetime Achievement Award.

26:12.165 --> 26:14.542
- I am figure skating.
- Stop it!

26:15.084 --> 26:18.254
For three years I've been trying to get
over the nightmare you two created.

26:18.379 --> 26:20.298
I wasn't sure I'd ever forget it.

26:20.423 --> 26:25.386
Now maybe underneath all your bullshit,
we can still find something beautiful.

26:26.012 --> 26:27.347
I don't know, Coach.

26:27.472 --> 26:29.474
I mean, I'm really desperate
to win that gold, but...

26:29.599 --> 26:32.727
But what?
How's the partner search coming, kid?

26:33.603 --> 26:35.313
What's so funny, Cool Whip?

26:35.438 --> 26:38.650
You getting a lot of satisfaction
from those $15 hookers?

26:38.775 --> 26:42.153
I am never satisfied. It's a curse.

26:44.239 --> 26:47.909
The registration for the National Finals
closes in exactly 12 hours.

26:48.034 --> 26:50.578
Now let me ask you boys a question.

26:51.204 --> 26:53.331
Do you wanna make history?

26:57.835 --> 27:00.630
No way.
This guy could not hold my jock sweat.

27:00.755 --> 27:02.215
I could hold it all day long. Try me.

27:02.340 --> 27:03.591
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you should.

27:03.716 --> 27:04.801
You challenging me, Princess?

27:04.926 --> 27:07.595
I'm not inviting you to the Skating
Federation's Annual Christmas Party.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.888
- Then bring it on!
- It is on!

27:09.013 --> 27:10.598
Good. We're in agreement then.

27:10.723 --> 27:11.766
- What?
- What?

27:11.891 --> 27:14.602
Welcome back to competitive skating,
gentlemen.

27:15.270 --> 27:17.689
I'll pick you up in the morning.

27:18.481 --> 27:19.899
Little help.

27:29.576 --> 27:32.245
Here we go. Show time.

27:33.496 --> 27:37.458
Stranz. Fairchild. Melissa Kelly, ESPN2.

27:37.584 --> 27:39.919
So, let me ask you,
any thoughts on the competition?

27:40.044 --> 27:41.713
And what does a new gold medal
mean for you?

27:41.838 --> 27:43.715
It doesn't mean as much
as winning America's hearts.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.300
That's very important to us.

27:45.425 --> 27:47.051
Now we haven't seen you
in about three and a half years.

27:47.176 --> 27:48.261
What have you been up to?

27:48.386 --> 27:49.554
Skating.

27:49.762 --> 27:51.848
<i>Now apparently you're dedicating</i>
<i>this performance</i>

27:51.973 --> 27:54.309
<i>to the children of the world.</i>

28:00.940 --> 28:02.191
Sorry.

28:04.152 --> 28:06.446
- Chazz, fill this out.
- No.

28:06.571 --> 28:08.031
Yes.

28:08.156 --> 28:09.490
I'll get yours, Jimmy.

28:09.616 --> 28:10.950
Who is that girl?

28:11.075 --> 28:12.619
You mean Katie Van Waldenberg?

28:12.744 --> 28:14.662
She's Stranz and Fairchild's sister?

28:14.787 --> 28:17.332
Fairchild's legs and Stranz's ass.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.335
Mind bottling, isn't it?

28:20.710 --> 28:23.338
- Did you just say "mind bottling?"
- Yeah, mind bottling.

28:23.463 --> 28:24.505
You know, when things are so crazy,

28:24.631 --> 28:26.674
it gets your thoughts all trapped,
like in a bottle.

28:26.799 --> 28:30.094
All right, boys.
Let's go do this. Loud and proud.

28:32.805 --> 28:34.057
What are you two doing here?

28:34.182 --> 28:37.685
You know damn well I'm not letting
either of you sign up. They're banned.

28:37.810 --> 28:40.104
I'm not here to sign up
Michaels or MacElroy.

28:40.230 --> 28:44.108
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

28:44.108 --> 28:44.776
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

28:44.901 --> 28:46.236
Thank you.

28:48.863 --> 28:51.282
Now there's your front page headline.

28:51.407 --> 28:53.826
Jimmy, can you wave to the fans?

28:54.202 --> 28:57.455
So Jimmy and Chazz together
and no fighting, huh?

29:01.292 --> 29:05.380
Two men skating together
and in our division, no less.

29:05.505 --> 29:06.965
Why, Stranz?

29:07.090 --> 29:08.925
Why is God singling us out

29:09.050 --> 29:11.344
for the greatest suffering
the world has ever known?

29:11.469 --> 29:14.764
I don't know, sis. Those two are nothing
but a couple of freaks.

29:14.889 --> 29:16.391
Yeah, and the media loves freaks.

29:16.516 --> 29:17.809
Makes my blood boil.

29:17.934 --> 29:20.895
And all they're doing is just leeching
the dignity out of our beloved sport.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.230
You know, I'm not a violent person,

29:22.355 --> 29:25.817
but I would like to hold them down
and skate over their throats.

29:25.942 --> 29:28.736
Guys, maybe,
maybe if you concentrate on the skating

29:28.861 --> 29:30.238
people will forget all the hype

29:30.363 --> 29:33.199
and they'll focus
on the purity of the sport

29:33.324 --> 29:35.994
and the spirit of honest competition.

29:38.705 --> 29:40.290
You guys just want to cheat again,
don't you?

29:40.415 --> 29:41.833
- That's a good idea.
- Much better.

29:41.958 --> 29:44.460
Katie, please,
will you just take this camcorder, okay?

29:44.586 --> 29:47.088
I don't know how to turn it on.
Thank you.

29:47.213 --> 29:48.590
No, I'm not spying for you again.

29:48.715 --> 29:51.551
We're just asking you
to discreetly tape their practice routines.

29:51.676 --> 29:53.386
Find someone else.

29:56.764 --> 29:58.224
- What's that, Mother?
- Don't.

29:58.349 --> 30:00.560
You and Father are sad
that you were killed

30:00.685 --> 30:03.605
driving Katie to her ice skating lesson
all those years ago?

30:03.730 --> 30:05.023
Yeah. Me, too.

30:05.148 --> 30:07.817
Remember how they used to be alive?

30:07.942 --> 30:09.068
Papa?

30:09.736 --> 30:12.864
I can't hear you, Papa.
What are you... You're crying?

30:12.989 --> 30:16.200
Still? In heaven? You're still dead?

30:16.868 --> 30:19.162
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Yes.

30:19.287 --> 30:22.207
Now you're playing
for team Van Waldenberg.

30:27.712 --> 30:30.882
All right.
You'll be staying here for the duration.

30:34.802 --> 30:38.306
You're gonna skate as a pair.
You'll live as a pair.

30:38.806 --> 30:41.309
And if you're at all interested
in self-preservation,

30:41.434 --> 30:45.230
you take off your shoes
before you set foot on the Berber.

30:46.272 --> 30:48.233
Why would we step in baby food?

30:48.358 --> 30:51.402
- He's talking about the carpet. Berber?
- What are you? The Rug Doctor?

30:51.527 --> 30:53.613
- Maybe I am.
- I'm the rug master.

30:53.738 --> 30:57.367
- What does that even mean?
- Shut up and take off your damn shoes.

31:01.037 --> 31:03.581
- Bunk beds?
- I don't share rooms.

31:03.706 --> 31:07.877
I don't share shit.
The night is a very dark time for me.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.338
It's dark for everyone, moron.

31:10.463 --> 31:12.799
Not for Alaskans or dudes
with night vision goggles.

31:12.924 --> 31:14.801
All right, this is gonna stop right now.

31:14.926 --> 31:17.929
From here on out, you guys are a team.
Do you understand?

31:18.054 --> 31:19.556
You are going to eat together,
sleep together.

31:19.681 --> 31:21.015
You are going to pee together.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.643
You're gonna file
a joint income tax return.

31:23.768 --> 31:26.896
Practice starts now. End of discussion.

31:37.282 --> 31:39.158
I just put those into order.

31:39.284 --> 31:41.286
I need some counter space, too.

31:44.247 --> 31:47.792
- Mane n' Tail. Is this horse shampoo?
- Yes, it is.

31:47.917 --> 31:50.545
- Do you use this stuff on your hair?
- Uh-huh.

31:51.421 --> 31:55.425
"For a lustrous coat."
Does this actually work?

31:55.550 --> 31:56.926
You bet your ass it does.

31:57.051 --> 32:00.680
It makes my hair shine like Orion's belt
out on the ice.

32:02.932 --> 32:06.394
And then I brush my hair
100 times with this.

32:10.231 --> 32:11.441
Cool brush.

32:11.566 --> 32:14.736
Not just a brush but a Verticoli.

32:15.528 --> 32:19.073
Handmade in Italy.
They carve it out of illegal whalebone.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.367
They only make 11 of them a year.

32:21.492 --> 32:25.705
This one cost me $12,000
or 30 million lira.

32:26.956 --> 32:30.710
Perfectly balanced, low drag,
minimal torque.

32:30.835 --> 32:32.503
How minimal?

32:32.629 --> 32:34.631
I bet you'd like to know.

32:35.590 --> 32:37.133
Help yourself to the Mane n' Tail
all you want,

32:37.258 --> 32:39.552
but don't even look at the Verticoli.

32:39.761 --> 32:41.888
'Cause I will knock your block off.

32:42.013 --> 32:43.389
No exaggeration,

32:43.514 --> 32:47.393
I could not love a human baby
as much as I love this brush.

32:53.733 --> 32:54.817
I call top.

32:54.943 --> 32:58.988
- Sorry, I already called it in my head.
- You can't do that. That doesn't count.

32:59.113 --> 33:02.033
Yes, it does. Get used to it, Jimmy.

33:03.451 --> 33:05.495
You're in Chazz's world now.

33:06.496 --> 33:08.164
You know what?
I permanently called shotgun.

33:08.289 --> 33:10.500
You do not get shotgun every time.

33:10.625 --> 33:14.504
What is this place? It smells like fish.

33:14.629 --> 33:15.880
Sweet.

33:16.881 --> 33:19.467
This ice has not been
properly Zambonied.

33:19.592 --> 33:21.844
- And where's the warm-down room?
- We don't have any of that.

33:21.970 --> 33:23.638
What we got is a cold storage unit

33:23.763 --> 33:26.641
that a buddy of mine let me flood
with a garden hose.

33:26.766 --> 33:28.518
Nice choice, Coach.

33:29.185 --> 33:30.895
Turned out well.

33:31.020 --> 33:34.232
The dance lift, the press lift,
the twist lift,

33:34.774 --> 33:37.694
the side by side jump, the throw jump.

33:37.819 --> 33:40.446
All of these are weapons
in the pairs skaters' arsenal.

33:40.572 --> 33:42.991
And used properly,
they can slay your opponent.

33:43.116 --> 33:46.578
Used improperly,
you can break every bone in your body.

33:47.495 --> 33:50.248
All right, gentlemen, waltz position.

34:01.217 --> 34:02.844
You know what, dude,
your hand has to be on top.

34:02.969 --> 34:04.429
No way. The girl's goes on top.

34:04.554 --> 34:06.306
Yeah. Ergo. Chick.

34:06.431 --> 34:07.724
I'm not the girl. I'm stronger.

34:07.849 --> 34:09.434
No, I'm stronger
and don't have a vagina.

34:09.559 --> 34:11.728
You are not stronger.
Watch this, fat ass.

34:11.853 --> 34:12.896
Fat ass?

34:13.021 --> 34:14.813
It doesn't really matter,
it's waltz position.

34:14.938 --> 34:16.733
One guy, you put your, just...

34:16.858 --> 34:19.193
See that?
It's pure pec, bicep, and tricep.

34:19.319 --> 34:20.360
Jimmy, get off your hands.

34:20.485 --> 34:22.614
You're gonna need those later.
Now, come on.

34:22.739 --> 34:23.864
All right.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.992
Okay, you know what?
I can do something cool, too.

34:26.117 --> 34:27.201
Chazz. Chazz.

34:27.327 --> 34:31.456
You think you're so tough. Huh?
I'm not fat. I can do this.

34:31.581 --> 34:34.417
- Chazz, put your skates back on.
- No, it's too late. They're off.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.878
- Look, I'm like lightning.
- Put your skates back on.

34:37.003 --> 34:38.129
What are you doing?

34:38.254 --> 34:40.715
- Yeah. God, that burns.
- Oh, yeah?

34:41.799 --> 34:43.967
Jimmy, you put your clothes on. Jimmy!

34:44.092 --> 34:45.844
- Damn it!
- Watch my Icy Hot Super Slide.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.013
- Do it.
- I will.

34:47.138 --> 34:50.475
It's not gonna matter
'cause you're flat in front like Ken.

35:06.824 --> 35:07.951
You're the girl.

35:08.076 --> 35:10.036
- What?
- You're my pretty lady, MacElroy.

35:10.161 --> 35:12.580
- Wait. Why?
- Because you whine like one!

35:12.705 --> 35:16.334
And no one can lift your fat ass.
You're on a diet, starting now.

35:16.459 --> 35:19.295
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go! Come on!

35:19.420 --> 35:21.464
Is this about my muscular, thick thighs?

35:22.966 --> 35:25.134
Could one of you all pass me a biscuit?

35:25.260 --> 35:28.221
You got another five miles,
then you get a LUNA bar.

35:28.346 --> 35:29.722
Come on.

35:31.766 --> 35:34.686
So, Coach, I was thinking
about the music for our routine.

35:34.811 --> 35:36.271
- Really?
- We're gonna skate to one song,

35:36.396 --> 35:39.482
one song only.
<i>Lady Hump</i> by the Black Eyed Peas.

35:39.607 --> 35:42.860
<i>What you gonna do with all that junk</i>
<i>All that junk inside my trunk</i>

35:42.986 --> 35:46.239
<i>I'm gonna get you, get you drunk</i>
<i>Get you drunk off my lady hump</i>

35:46.364 --> 35:49.576
<i>My hump, my hump</i>
<i>My lovely lady hump</i>

35:49.701 --> 35:52.745
I'm not skating to anything
with references to lady humps.

35:52.871 --> 35:53.997
I don't even know what that means.

35:54.122 --> 35:56.958
No one knows what it means,
but it's provocative.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.918
- No, it's not. It's gross.
- It gets the people going.

35:59.043 --> 36:02.714
That's enough!
Why do you guys keep doing that?

36:14.267 --> 36:16.185
You didn't see shit!

36:17.103 --> 36:18.730
- Coach!
- Shut up!

36:24.569 --> 36:26.529
Throw me some chicken!

36:28.573 --> 36:29.949
Two men.

36:30.074 --> 36:32.118
Together. You're really gonna go
through with this, huh?

36:32.243 --> 36:33.578
Oh, yeah, of course. Why not?

36:33.703 --> 36:35.330
I mean, I need your help.
What do you say?

36:35.455 --> 36:38.458
Look, I'm just a choreographer.
What do I know?

36:38.583 --> 36:40.168
Bring them
by the dance studio tomorrow.

36:40.293 --> 36:41.961
- Great!
- I'm not a magician.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.129
I ain't making no promises.

36:43.254 --> 36:45.548
I'm just saying
that I'm'a do what I can do.

36:45.673 --> 36:48.760
Your problem is your boundaries.
That ends today.

36:48.885 --> 36:50.178
Out on my dance floor you won't know

36:50.303 --> 36:52.347
where one man's body ends
and another begins.

36:52.472 --> 36:55.183
Because if you can't dance with a man,
you damn sure can't skate with a man.

36:55.308 --> 36:57.352
All right? So come on, let's go.

36:58.937 --> 36:59.938
Jimmy.

37:00.813 --> 37:01.940
Yeah.

37:02.857 --> 37:03.942
That's what I thought.

37:04.067 --> 37:05.944
That a boy, Jimmy. Come on.

37:06.444 --> 37:08.947
Okay. Break it down.
Show me what you got.

37:10.573 --> 37:13.076
Okay. That's a start. That is a start.

37:40.853 --> 37:42.313
You're tensing your face.
If you tense your face,

37:42.438 --> 37:44.190
you're gonna make it harder
for yourselves.

37:44.315 --> 37:45.942
Just enable...

37:51.739 --> 37:54.534
Rewind it.
I wanna see his head bang down again.

38:02.208 --> 38:05.795
No. No, no.
You act right or you leave my studio.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.674
Beautiful butterfly into a prayer.
Nice into...

38:13.469 --> 38:15.471
Let them get it out. Let them get it out.

38:15.597 --> 38:19.225
Chazz, release to Jimmy.
Easy, see? Release...

38:22.228 --> 38:23.897
- Yes.
- No. No.

38:39.954 --> 38:40.955
You nailed it!

38:41.080 --> 38:45.084
Yes, I did. See that? Pure power.
You could use a nickel's worth, junior.

38:45.210 --> 38:46.753
Maybe if you released me
at that quarter-turn,

38:46.878 --> 38:48.713
I wouldn't have to save your ass
with my landing.

38:48.838 --> 38:52.217
It's called improvisation.
Even your precious Kenny G does it.

38:52.342 --> 38:54.427
Well, at least they're getting
the moves down.

38:54.552 --> 38:59.015
Yeah, but can they do it in front of
five judges and 30 million people?

39:01.726 --> 39:04.103
<i>Denver, Colorado, last stop on the road</i>

39:04.229 --> 39:06.689
<i>to the World Wintersport Games</i>
<i>in Montreal.</i>

39:06.814 --> 39:09.651
<i>The finest skaters from all over</i>
<i>the country have trained tirelessly,</i>

39:09.776 --> 39:12.654
<i>for years for their chance</i>
<i>to make it onto the world stage.</i>

39:12.779 --> 39:15.031
<i>But all those stories</i>
<i>have been eclipsed now</i>

39:15.156 --> 39:17.742
<i>by what many dub</i>
<i>the Sideshow of the Century.</i>

39:17.909 --> 39:21.788
<i>The male-male pair of Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

39:21.913 --> 39:24.666
<i>The anxiety was palpable</i>
<i>when they arrived this morning</i>

39:24.791 --> 39:28.044
<i>as the skating community</i>
<i>continued to voice its outrage.</i>

39:28.169 --> 39:30.380
Those two are turning this sport
into a freak show.

39:30.588 --> 39:32.882
As if figure skating
wasn't gay enough already.

39:33.258 --> 39:36.886
Let me show you something.
Does that look right to you?

39:37.262 --> 39:39.264
Nothing in here about two men skating.

39:39.430 --> 39:43.101
That blonde chick's a dude? Oh, man.

39:43.601 --> 39:46.229
<i>Now let's join Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

39:46.354 --> 39:47.981
<i>as they wind up their routine,</i>

39:48.106 --> 39:52.318
<i>an edgy look at urban culture</i>
<i>told in the language of the streets.</i>

39:53.695 --> 39:56.823
<i>And boy, look at them!</i>
<i>They are really having fun with this.</i>

39:56.948 --> 40:01.202
<i>The bling is king. This pair</i>
<i>is willing the crowd into a frenzy.</i>

40:04.247 --> 40:05.623
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

40:14.424 --> 40:17.135
<i>Wow! Flawless, as always.</i>

40:17.260 --> 40:19.971
<i>These two blue-eyed funk machines</i>
<i>are going to find themselves</i>

40:20.096 --> 40:24.100
<i>popping and locking their way</i>
<i>to the championship in Montreal.</i>

40:24.225 --> 40:26.102
<i>And those good vibrations seem</i>

40:26.227 --> 40:29.314
<i>to have spread all the way</i>
<i>through this arena.</i>

40:31.649 --> 40:33.109
What, what!

40:37.155 --> 40:38.781
You guys are up.

40:39.407 --> 40:41.618
<i>And now the moment</i>
<i>this crowd has been waiting for.</i>

40:41.743 --> 40:43.745
<i>And how is this going to work?</i>

40:43.870 --> 40:47.498
<i>Completely different skaters,</i>
<i>known to be enemies of one another,</i>

40:47.624 --> 40:52.545
<i>combining to be the first male-male</i>
<i>pair team in the history of the sport.</i>

40:52.670 --> 40:55.924
<i>Either the locked-in technical style</i>
<i>of MacElroy</i>

40:56.049 --> 40:59.385
<i>will not mesh</i>
<i>with Michaels' improvisations</i>

40:59.510 --> 41:01.471
<i>or they create great music together</i>

41:01.596 --> 41:04.515
<i>and reinvent the sport</i>
<i>in their own image.</i>

41:08.394 --> 41:10.063
They're laughing at us.

41:11.064 --> 41:14.234
They laughed at Louis Armstrong when
he said he was gonna go to the moon.

41:14.359 --> 41:17.070
Now he's up there laughing at them.

41:21.324 --> 41:25.161
<i>Well, they titled this routine</i>
<i>"Fire and Ice."</i>

41:25.286 --> 41:28.581
<i>They've always been that way</i>
<i>as competitors, as individuals</i>

41:28.706 --> 41:30.583
<i>and now as a pair team?</i>

41:30.708 --> 41:32.335
<i>So appropriate.</i>

42:24.137 --> 42:25.763
<i>So far, so good.</i>

42:31.603 --> 42:34.772
<i>Their first move's so difficult.</i>
<i>Throw triple Axel.</i>

42:34.898 --> 42:36.316
First throw.

42:37.901 --> 42:38.943
<i>Man down.</i>

42:39.068 --> 42:42.906
<i>What an unbelievably disastrous</i>
<i>beginning to this routine!</i>

42:44.991 --> 42:46.784
I've never fallen once in competition.

42:46.910 --> 42:48.870
Come on. Take my hand.

42:49.996 --> 42:51.581
We can do this.

42:53.625 --> 42:54.667
<i>And they're up.</i>

42:54.792 --> 42:57.003
Come on, Denver, get off your asses!

42:57.921 --> 42:59.464
Let's go!

42:59.964 --> 43:01.174
<i>And the crowd responds.</i>

43:01.299 --> 43:05.261
<i>It's the first time they've shown them</i>
<i>any level of support.</i>

43:08.640 --> 43:12.143
<i>Side by side double Axels!</i>
<i>Beautifully delivered!</i>

43:16.356 --> 43:17.774
<i>And again, a male-male pair team.</i>

43:17.899 --> 43:21.736
<i>They're doing things</i>
<i>that no other pair would dare to do.</i>

43:35.959 --> 43:37.502
<i>Incredible!</i>

43:51.307 --> 43:55.353
<i>So many moves in this programme</i>
<i>I've never heard of before.</i>

44:02.777 --> 44:03.903
Yes!

44:12.912 --> 44:15.707
<i>Unbelievable finish</i>
<i>to an incredible routine!</i>

44:15.832 --> 44:18.251
<i>And they've won this crowd over!</i>

44:20.920 --> 44:21.963
Yes!

44:22.755 --> 44:25.884
<i>This might be enough</i>
<i>to send them to Montreal</i>

44:26.009 --> 44:30.555
as the first male-male representatives
this sport has ever seen.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.557
<i>History in the making.</i>

44:44.235 --> 44:45.445
Yeah!

44:53.870 --> 44:55.705
We love you, Denver!

44:56.539 --> 44:59.250
City by the bay! John Denver!

45:03.504 --> 45:06.007
- Was the fire really necessary?
- Ask them.

45:09.802 --> 45:13.348
- That's what I'm talking about!
- I'm so proud of you. Good job.

45:15.558 --> 45:17.143
What up, homes?

45:21.272 --> 45:23.024
You guys were great out there.

45:23.149 --> 45:25.443
Thanks. I'm Jimmy.

45:25.568 --> 45:27.195
I know. Katie.

45:27.570 --> 45:28.821
I know.

45:32.450 --> 45:34.244
I like your buttons.

45:35.203 --> 45:37.330
Jimmy, come on. The scores are up.

45:37.747 --> 45:39.415
- Good luck.
- You, too.

45:39.541 --> 45:41.709
Did you see that?
They were actually pretty good.

45:41.834 --> 45:43.628
Yeah, they were really good. Way to go.

45:43.753 --> 45:45.171
None of what they did
was on your video.

45:45.296 --> 45:47.090
That's all right.
Let's not let them get into our heads.

45:47.215 --> 45:49.300
Into our head?
Not only did we embarrass Marky Mark,

45:49.425 --> 45:50.969
we let down the Funky Bunch.

45:51.094 --> 45:54.472
<i>... 5.9, 5.9, 5.8, 6.0!</i>

45:54.597 --> 45:55.598
- Yes! Yes!
- Oh, my gosh!

45:55.723 --> 45:58.059
We're going to Montreal, bitch!

45:59.310 --> 46:01.896
Well, it's all smiles
here in the Crest kiss and cry area.

46:02.021 --> 46:05.066
You're the guys everybody's
talking about. How does it feel?

46:05.191 --> 46:08.403
You know, we're just so grateful
for this wonderful opportunity

46:08.528 --> 46:09.779
to be out here on the ice again...

46:09.904 --> 46:12.824
Michaels and MacElroy are a freight
train from hell, okay?

46:12.949 --> 46:16.744
We're going straight up
the ass of the competition, Scott.

46:17.996 --> 46:19.914
I'm not gonna say wow, but wow!

46:20.039 --> 46:24.168
They got by on 97 percent adrenaline
and three percent bullshit.

46:24.294 --> 46:28.631
If they wanna take home the gold,
they gotta do something spectacular.

46:28.756 --> 46:29.841
Robert, I know where this is going.

46:29.966 --> 46:32.427
How many times
do you have to make the same mistake?

46:32.552 --> 46:35.722
Till I get it right.
You gotta trust me, Jesse.

46:37.098 --> 46:40.727
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
in a cage of fear.

46:44.939 --> 46:47.942
Top of the morning. And it is a beaut.

46:49.319 --> 46:52.113
Do you mind? I'm trying to eat here.

46:52.780 --> 46:56.075
Just thought you'd like to see
what a skater's body really looks like.

46:56.201 --> 46:58.703
Go ahead, drink it in. Don't be shy.

46:58.828 --> 47:02.624
Looking's for free.
Touching's gonna cost you something.

47:06.169 --> 47:07.962
Checking out my ink?

47:08.504 --> 47:11.758
Some people refer to me
as the Illustrated Man.

47:11.883 --> 47:16.262
Each tattoo tells a different tale.
They're like chapters of my life.

47:16.387 --> 47:19.766
Really? So, what's that one about?

47:21.851 --> 47:26.731
That one represents the dragon lady.
You might know her as Michelle Kwan.

47:26.856 --> 47:30.652
That's Michelle Kwan, most decorated
figure skater in US history?

47:30.777 --> 47:33.071
- You tapped that?
- Sure did.

47:33.696 --> 47:36.115
But perfection can drive a woman mad.

47:36.241 --> 47:38.159
She was ready to quit,
hang up her skates

47:38.284 --> 47:41.496
settle down and pop out
a few little Chazzlings.

47:41.621 --> 47:44.791
I couldn't let her do it, not the way I roll.

47:44.916 --> 47:47.460
So, what's that one with the horse?

47:48.503 --> 47:50.380
My blonde Ukrainian she-devil.

47:50.505 --> 47:52.632
Not Oksana Baiul?

47:52.757 --> 47:55.093
At 16, she won the gold, turned pro,

47:55.218 --> 47:59.013
and was named one of Barbara Walters'
most fascinating persons of 1994.

47:59.138 --> 48:03.393
Yeah. But don't let her fool you.
She's as cold as the ice she skates on.

48:04.060 --> 48:07.438
She's like dry ice.
Wait. She's colder than that.

48:07.564 --> 48:09.649
- What's colder than dry ice?
- I don't know.

48:09.774 --> 48:12.151
I'll tell you what is. Oksana.

48:16.698 --> 48:19.534
What about that one on your shoulder?
Who's that?

48:20.326 --> 48:22.370
That one? It's nothing.

48:23.371 --> 48:25.415
What about you? You got any tats?

48:25.540 --> 48:28.751
I had my face painted
at the Blueberry Festival one year.

48:28.877 --> 48:30.587
Seems about right.

48:30.712 --> 48:34.173
Well, I could have one.
I could have a killer one.

48:35.842 --> 48:39.304
I have a crush on the enemy,
Katie Van Waldenberg.

48:39.429 --> 48:40.680
Good choice, my man.

48:40.805 --> 48:42.640
Yeah. How's that for forbidden love?

48:42.765 --> 48:45.643
I have no idea, but I'd like to find out.

48:46.352 --> 48:48.855
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm calling her. Or rather, you are.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.815
- I can't do that. It's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

48:50.940 --> 48:52.108
What am I supposed to say?

48:52.233 --> 48:54.152
- No, you can't. I can't.
- It's ringing. Go.

48:58.072 --> 49:00.200
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's Nike.

49:02.035 --> 49:03.203
Van Waldenberg Companies.

49:03.328 --> 49:05.163
Talk. Relax.

49:06.164 --> 49:09.083
Hi. It's Jimmy MacElroy. Is Katie there?

49:10.293 --> 49:11.753
It's MacElroy, for her.

49:11.878 --> 49:13.796
What? For me? Why?

49:14.088 --> 49:15.882
- I can't do it.
- I'll coach you. Get on the phone.

49:16.090 --> 49:17.342
Stranz?

49:20.386 --> 49:21.387
<i>Hello?</i>

49:21.512 --> 49:24.474
Okay. "Yo. It's the Mac attack.
What up?"

49:25.016 --> 49:28.061
Yo. Hi. It's the Mac attack. What up?

49:28.394 --> 49:32.148
Okay. Say, "Oh, my, you're just
catching me getting out of the shower."

49:32.273 --> 49:34.651
- Sell yourself.
- Will you be quiet?

49:35.401 --> 49:37.612
You know, you just caught me
getting out of the shower.

49:37.737 --> 49:39.864
- She just got out of the shower.
- Oh, me likey.

49:39.989 --> 49:41.908
- I have to call her back. This is so rude.
- No! Are you insane?

49:42.033 --> 49:44.953
- She's gonna hear you.
- Get back on the phone. Say, "Shower?

49:45.078 --> 49:47.956
"I gotta get me one of those
'cause I just got back from the gym

49:48.081 --> 49:50.166
"doing my squat thrusts."

49:51.125 --> 49:53.461
I gotta...
Yeah, shower. I need one of those

49:53.586 --> 49:56.965
'cause I just got back from the gym
doing my squat thrusts.

49:57.090 --> 49:59.717
"Squat thrusts must be hard, real hard."

50:00.593 --> 50:01.719
<i>Squat thrusts are hard.</i>

50:02.095 --> 50:03.972
- "Real hard."
- Real hard.

50:04.389 --> 50:08.518
"They're hard, all right. But it's worth it
to get a sweet burn deep in your thigh."

50:08.643 --> 50:12.564
It's worth it to get a deep burn
in my sweet thighs.

50:12.939 --> 50:16.025
"You know
how you can soothe a nasty burn?

50:16.818 --> 50:18.570
"Pour some sweet cream on it."

50:18.903 --> 50:21.739
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what you can do for a burn?</i>

50:21.865 --> 50:23.074
<i>Pour sweet cream on it.</i>

50:23.199 --> 50:25.201
Oh, my God, you've bagged a wild lynx.

50:25.326 --> 50:28.121
Okay, say, "Sounds to me like
your cream needs to be whipped",

50:28.246 --> 50:29.414
and then go...

50:32.542 --> 50:35.545
I was wondering if you wanted
to get a snow cone sometime?

50:35.670 --> 50:36.754
What?

50:36.880 --> 50:39.757
Yeah. I would like to get a snow cone.

50:40.216 --> 50:42.218
I haven't had a snow cone
in a couple of years, actually.

50:42.343 --> 50:43.386
No, you have to be sexy.

50:43.511 --> 50:45.597
Say you want a snow boner.
Snow boner.

50:45.722 --> 50:48.057
8:00 tonight. That sounds great.

50:48.182 --> 50:51.561
It will
"get me time to get my jugs waxed."

50:52.270 --> 50:54.522
Okay. Well, I'll see you.

50:55.189 --> 50:57.650
What happened? What's the word?

50:57.775 --> 51:00.111
8:00 tonight. We did it!

51:00.236 --> 51:01.613
Oh, my God!

51:02.572 --> 51:03.948
Nice lift.

51:05.950 --> 51:09.621
All right, listen up. You guys barely
squeaked by at Nationals.

51:09.746 --> 51:11.664
How are we gonna compete
against teams

51:11.789 --> 51:13.249
that have been doing this for years?

51:13.374 --> 51:14.792
There's only one way.

51:14.918 --> 51:19.005
Okay. What do you guys have
that none of the other teams have?

51:19.505 --> 51:21.174
- Twin dongs?
- Exactly.

51:21.299 --> 51:23.718
We have to do something
that only two men can do together.

51:23.843 --> 51:26.221
Something never seen before.

51:27.472 --> 51:29.474
Jesse, put in the tape.

51:30.183 --> 51:32.602
Come on. Put in the tape, Jesse.

51:39.567 --> 51:40.902
Thank you.

51:41.945 --> 51:46.074
Jimmy, I never told you this before,
but I used to coach pairs.

51:46.741 --> 51:49.577
I was on track
to head up the Olympic squad.

51:49.702 --> 51:52.455
I wanted it badly,
so I developed a move.

51:52.580 --> 51:56.376
A move the likes of which the world
had never seen before.

51:56.668 --> 52:00.046
A move so revolutionary, so dangerous

52:00.171 --> 52:04.801
that it would have catapulted the team
that stuck it straight to the top.

52:06.427 --> 52:08.221
And like many revolutionary ideas,

52:08.346 --> 52:11.224
it just scared the shit
out of the establishment.

52:12.392 --> 52:13.726
So I quit.

52:14.227 --> 52:19.190
And I took it to the one place on earth
batshit crazy enough to give it a try.

52:20.316 --> 52:21.359
North Korea.

52:21.484 --> 52:22.902
Of course.

52:23.027 --> 52:26.239
Behind the Bamboo Curtain, they call it

52:27.740 --> 52:29.576
"The Iron Lotus."

52:36.833 --> 52:39.377
Look at the grace, the beauty.

52:39.919 --> 52:43.006
They almost have it, until...

52:45.592 --> 52:47.051
Oh, my gosh.

52:51.472 --> 52:53.474
Okay.
What do you say, let's give it a try?

52:53.600 --> 52:57.103
- Are you nuts?
- What? That's crazy.

52:57.228 --> 52:58.354
Come on, what are you talking about?

52:58.479 --> 53:01.357
See, after all these years,
I know what went wrong.

53:01.482 --> 53:02.525
The physics were off.

53:02.650 --> 53:04.777
It was a man and a woman,
that's why it didn't work.

53:04.903 --> 53:07.488
You're two men. You should be fine.

53:09.699 --> 53:12.493
Be warned.
The Iron Lotus demands your respect.

53:12.619 --> 53:14.579
She has no time for lone wolves, Chazz.

53:14.704 --> 53:17.207
Jimmy, you've gotta be willing
to improvise.

53:17.332 --> 53:19.459
You two are the last pieces
of the puzzle.

53:19.584 --> 53:21.377
Go on! Fit them together!

53:27.383 --> 53:29.260
Keep your speed up.

53:29.886 --> 53:31.262
Keep it up!

53:33.264 --> 53:35.725
Jimmy! Don't let your legs buckle!

53:36.184 --> 53:39.103
Come on, Chazz, focus! Focus!

53:46.903 --> 53:48.112
My nut-sack!

53:49.280 --> 53:51.908
You gotta be careful, man.
Unlike you, I actually use these things.

53:52.033 --> 53:53.451
Oh, yeah? Well...

53:53.576 --> 53:58.122
Well, well, yeah, you're right.
I'll try to be more careful next time.

53:58.831 --> 54:00.041
Sorry.

54:00.708 --> 54:04.045
Look, I didn't mean to drag your balls
into the discussion.

54:04.170 --> 54:07.549
That was uncalled for.
They're fine, I overreacted.

54:08.049 --> 54:10.218
All right, gentlemen,
let's get up and try it again.

54:17.892 --> 54:19.394
Let's do this.

54:27.193 --> 54:29.696
This was my favourite place growing up.

54:29.821 --> 54:31.739
By the way, you look really nice.

54:31.865 --> 54:36.035
Oh, really?
I like your glitter-tooth necklace thing.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.579
Oh, thanks.

54:38.246 --> 54:40.748
Foy, can I have another blue one?

54:41.291 --> 54:45.753
You guys were so good at Nationals,
it scared my brother and sister.

54:45.879 --> 54:49.007
- They wanted me to spy on you.
- Really?

54:49.132 --> 54:50.925
Is that why you're going out
with me right now?

54:51.050 --> 54:52.135
No!

54:53.469 --> 54:54.721
Really.

54:55.263 --> 54:58.933
I don't care if they win.
I don't care about skating at all.

54:59.058 --> 55:01.686
I mean, really,
what's so great about skating, anyway?

55:01.811 --> 55:04.522
It's basically just gliding,
trying not to fall,

55:04.647 --> 55:06.983
with a couple of jumps thrown in, right?

55:07.108 --> 55:10.445
And Spandex and glitter. Egos.

55:11.279 --> 55:12.322
Ice blows.

55:15.617 --> 55:16.784
Sorry.

55:17.368 --> 55:20.914
But it's not the ice.
It's what the ice lets you do.

55:21.664 --> 55:24.959
Out there, I feel like I can do anything.

55:25.627 --> 55:28.546
It's the only place
where life makes sense.

55:31.591 --> 55:32.759
You've never skated?

55:32.884 --> 55:34.636
When I was a kid, a little.

55:34.761 --> 55:37.680
But my brother and sister
don't like anyone to steal their focus.

55:37.805 --> 55:39.766
My life was nothing but focus.

55:39.891 --> 55:41.935
You know what I got
for my tenth birthday?

55:42.060 --> 55:45.271
A six-pack of protein shakes
and a subscription to <i>Men's Health.</i>

55:45.396 --> 55:47.232
I didn't have a tenth birthday.

55:47.357 --> 55:50.193
My sister told all my friends
I was in jail for armed robbery.

55:50.318 --> 55:53.488
When I was nine, my dad insisted
on having me circumcised

55:53.613 --> 55:55.281
to minimise wind resistance.

55:55.406 --> 55:58.993
While driving me to skating practice,
my parents were in a fatal accident.

55:59.118 --> 56:00.703
My brother and sister
blame me for their death

56:00.828 --> 56:03.831
and they force me to work for them
like a slave.

56:24.227 --> 56:25.311
Wow.

56:26.020 --> 56:29.899
I never really thought of that
as a romantic story before.

56:40.034 --> 56:44.330
So, how'd it go with your lady?
Carve up any ice with your wiener?

56:44.455 --> 56:46.958
All right, ladies, tea party's over.

56:47.083 --> 56:50.879
We got two days till Montreal.
I wanna see an Iron Lotus.

56:57.594 --> 56:59.137
Okay, try it again.

56:59.971 --> 57:02.473
You're gonna kill him! Watch the blade!

57:02.724 --> 57:03.850
Come on!

57:07.812 --> 57:09.355
Try it again!

57:14.986 --> 57:17.363
One more. I'm really close.

57:24.078 --> 57:28.416
<i>Hello, and welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to the Orbitz World Wintersport Games</i>

57:28.541 --> 57:30.585
<i>here in beautiful Montreal, Canada.</i>

57:32.295 --> 57:35.632
<i>The world turns its eyes</i>
<i>now to this frozen sanctuary</i>

57:35.757 --> 57:38.676
<i>as the globe's finest athletes</i>
<i>arrive to compete</i>

57:38.801 --> 57:41.679
<i>and to revel in the glory that is sport.</i>

57:42.138 --> 57:46.059
<i>And so, now we are honoured</i>
<i>to bring you the wonder, pageantry,</i>

57:46.184 --> 57:51.064
<i>and spectacle of these,</i>
<i>the 20th World Wintersport Games.</i>

57:57.362 --> 57:59.155
Didn't you once say, and I quote,

57:59.280 --> 58:02.408
"Jimmy MacElroy
is a lifeless robot on the ice"?

58:02.534 --> 58:05.161
- He would never say such a...
- Yes, I did.

58:05.286 --> 58:08.706
But I was referring
to the precision and beauty of robots.

58:08.831 --> 58:10.583
If they'd published
the rest of the quote...

58:10.708 --> 58:13.795
They did publish the rest of your quote.
You go on to say,

58:13.920 --> 58:15.838
"I've had lint at the top of my ass crack

58:15.964 --> 58:19.008
"with more personality
than that Daddy's boy." End quote.

58:19.133 --> 58:21.678
All right,
Mr Smart Reporter, showing off.

58:21.803 --> 58:25.890
You figured out how to work
the Google on the Internet machine.

58:26.015 --> 58:27.684
Well, here's a new quote for you,
all right?

58:27.809 --> 58:31.980
Chazz Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy
are figure skating. Boom!

58:32.105 --> 58:33.314
Boom!

58:34.816 --> 58:38.152
Jimmy! Has pairs skating
helped your popularity?

58:38.778 --> 58:41.406
Absolutely.
I have the best fans in the world.

58:41.531 --> 58:44.576
I mean,
we have the best fans in the world.

58:49.581 --> 58:51.833
No, that's in the other room.

59:01.342 --> 59:02.510
Boom.

59:03.887 --> 59:05.054
Nice.

59:06.055 --> 59:08.600
Great! Press loves them,
and now so do the sponsors.

59:08.725 --> 59:09.851
Stranz!

59:09.976 --> 59:14.689
So, Katie, it looks like your date
went really well the other night, huh?

59:14.814 --> 59:17.650
What? I guess so. Why?

59:17.775 --> 59:19.903
No reason. I was just wondering
how it went. Did it go well?

59:20.028 --> 59:22.530
- Yeah, we had snow cones...
- Oh, that's so great.

59:22.655 --> 59:24.866
We want you to turn your attention
to Chazz now.

59:24.991 --> 59:25.992
What?

59:26.117 --> 59:29.078
MacElroy's heart is like
a beautiful apple that's in your hand

59:29.204 --> 59:30.830
and now you need to bite it.

59:30.955 --> 59:33.791
- Nothing breaks up a team faster than...
- Herpes.

59:34.417 --> 59:35.710
Jealousy.

59:36.044 --> 59:38.338
No. I'm not gonna make
Chazz Michael Michaels

59:38.463 --> 59:39.464
fall in love with me.

59:39.589 --> 59:41.633
Who's talking about love?
We just want you to have sex with him.

59:41.758 --> 59:44.385
What? No!
I am not gonna have sex with Chazz.

59:44.510 --> 59:47.430
Come on, Katie.
Do the honourable thing here.

59:47.555 --> 59:50.516
The honourable thing is to walk away
and that is exactly what I'm doing.

59:50.642 --> 59:54.604
Okay. Stranz, let her go. It's okay.
She's made up her mind.

59:55.855 --> 59:57.774
We'll just move on to Plan B.

59:58.775 --> 01:00:01.236
- What's Plan B?
- I'm sorry, don't worry about that.

01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:04.405
You stood your ground. Good for you.
We respect that.

01:00:04.531 --> 01:00:07.033
But if something should happen
to your new boyfriend's leg,

01:00:07.158 --> 01:00:10.453
I don't know, under his knee,
or above his ankle?

01:00:11.079 --> 01:00:13.831
At least you did the honourable thing.

01:00:19.337 --> 01:00:22.215
- Where're you going?
- Sex addicts meeting.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.426
- "Turn weakness into strength."
- Good for you.

01:00:25.552 --> 01:00:28.096
Thanks, brother man.
Have a good night.

01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:29.389
See ya!

01:00:32.892 --> 01:00:34.477
This must be for you.

01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:47.532
So glad you're all here.

01:00:48.032 --> 01:00:50.618
Okay, let's get started.

01:00:50.952 --> 01:00:54.581
Chazz, would you like
to start the day off by sharing?

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:58.084
I was just trying to find some peace.

01:00:58.209 --> 01:01:01.254
A haven,
a place where I could feel safe.

01:01:02.255 --> 01:01:04.257
And then what happened?

01:01:05.383 --> 01:01:07.886
Well, she was my yoga instructor.

01:01:09.888 --> 01:01:11.973
So I knew she was limber.

01:01:12.265 --> 01:01:16.728
But, Chazz, you realise this would just
set you back

01:01:16.853 --> 01:01:19.564
and further hurt your progress

01:01:19.689 --> 01:01:21.900
in maintaining control over your libido,
correct?

01:01:22.025 --> 01:01:24.194
Yes. Thank you, Taylor.

01:01:24.903 --> 01:01:26.237
Definitely.

01:01:26.821 --> 01:01:32.619
Until her friend, a massage therapist,
walked in the door naked.

01:01:32.744 --> 01:01:33.786
Easy, Chazz.

01:01:33.912 --> 01:01:35.371
With a big bottle of canola oil

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:39.375
and a monkey who was trained
to work on a video camera.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.586
And she rocked my world.

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.004
Guys!

01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:47.091
Chazz, I have asked you to leave before
and I don't wanna do it again.

01:01:47.217 --> 01:01:48.301
Taylor, come on, man.

01:01:48.426 --> 01:01:52.055
Let's just move on.
Who'd like to talk about Chlamydia?

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.183
Syphilis, gonorrhoea, et cetera.
Should we...

01:01:55.934 --> 01:01:58.811
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I was

01:02:00.063 --> 01:02:02.523
having sex. A lot.

01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:04.400
Welcome. Welcome.

01:02:04.526 --> 01:02:06.903
Why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourself?

01:02:07.028 --> 01:02:08.446
I know her.

01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:10.031
I'm Katie.

01:02:10.156 --> 01:02:11.282
And?

01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:14.077
Oh, and I'm a sex addict.

01:02:14.202 --> 01:02:15.370
Hi, Katie.

01:02:15.495 --> 01:02:16.621
Hey, Katie.

01:02:17.956 --> 01:02:21.042
Wow, so, you're a sex addict, too.

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:23.211
Sex, sex, sex. What can I say?

01:02:23.336 --> 01:02:27.340
Right. Right. I mean, you said it all.
It's such a burden.

01:02:27.465 --> 01:02:30.218
I mean, people don't realise what
we go through on a day-to-day basis.

01:02:30.343 --> 01:02:33.429
Why don't you come to my room tonight
and we can comfort each other?

01:02:33.555 --> 01:02:35.265
11:55 sharp.

01:02:39.143 --> 01:02:41.437
Come on, people, break it up!

01:02:51.489 --> 01:02:55.118
God grant me the serenity not
to have sex with my friend's girlfriend

01:02:55.243 --> 01:02:59.205
the courage to go home tonight without
having sex with my friend's girlfriend

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:00.874
and the wisdom
to know that masturbation

01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:04.127
is sometimes
the most sensible solution.

01:03:04.252 --> 01:03:05.670
Yeah. Okay.

01:03:09.883 --> 01:03:11.259
Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:03:11.384 --> 01:03:13.761
You're right on time. Come in.

01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:20.351
Would you like some champagne?

01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:22.854
No, I can't, I...

01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:25.940
Actually I just came by 'cause
I had something I had to say to you.

01:03:26.065 --> 01:03:27.108
What?

01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:29.986
Do you have a bathrobe or a parka
you could...

01:03:30.111 --> 01:03:32.197
Sorry. I'm hot.

01:03:33.448 --> 01:03:34.532
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable

01:03:34.657 --> 01:03:37.660
saying what you need to say
from the bed?

01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:39.412
Probably not.

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:40.747
It's a Posturepedic.

01:03:40.872 --> 01:03:44.042
Well, then, in that case,
it's good for my back,

01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:46.294
so might as well try it.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.881
Okay, here it goes.

01:03:50.006 --> 01:03:54.093
I know that sex,
I know that sex addiction is a disease.

01:03:54.219 --> 01:03:55.595
Oh, God, they feel so good.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.222
Oh, God, this is so wrong.

01:03:57.347 --> 01:03:58.932
Jimmy's my friend.
I'm not gonna do this.

01:03:59.057 --> 01:04:00.308
Wait. Do you really mean that?

01:04:00.433 --> 01:04:02.560
Yes, I think so. No.

01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:05.772
Yes, I do. I do.
I can't go through with this.

01:04:05.897 --> 01:04:06.981
Thank God.

01:04:07.106 --> 01:04:08.900
- Oh, God, what a relief.
- Yeah.

01:04:09.025 --> 01:04:10.735
He's got a heart of gold.

01:04:13.071 --> 01:04:16.324
You sex demon! You, you sex fiend!

01:04:16.449 --> 01:04:18.493
No, you got it all wrong.

01:04:19.369 --> 01:04:21.538
Impure! Lmpure!

01:04:21.663 --> 01:04:23.289
- Jimmy, wait!
- Hey, wait! Brother man!

01:04:23.414 --> 01:04:25.500
- Nothing happened!
- Jimmy!

01:04:27.627 --> 01:04:29.504
Wait! Jimmy!

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.506
- Get away!
- Jimmy! No!

01:04:32.173 --> 01:04:33.633
Damn it.

01:04:37.554 --> 01:04:39.764
Come on, pick up. Come on, buddy.

01:04:39.973 --> 01:04:43.017
<i>Hey, it's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

01:04:43.184 --> 01:04:44.769
Jimmy, it's me, Chazz.

01:04:44.894 --> 01:04:48.481
Look, what happened back there,
so not a big deal.

01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:53.111
Just think of it as like a boob handshake
between me and your lady's...

01:04:53.236 --> 01:04:56.865
Look, that's not coming out right.
I'll explain it. Call me back, please.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.575
It's me, Chazz.

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:01.536
I'm committed to this thing
called friendship.

01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:02.787
And I ain't going nowhere.

01:05:02.912 --> 01:05:05.415
And if you think I'm going anywhere,
you're wrong. You know why?

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.709
Because I will not back down, ever!

01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:11.838
I've won a lot of radio contests,
because I refused to get off the line!

01:05:11.963 --> 01:05:16.426
If we went to a Halloween party dressed
as Batman and Robin, I'd go as Robin.

01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:18.177
That's how much you mean to me.

01:05:18.303 --> 01:05:20.555
That was stupid that I said that.
You know what? No.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.141
I don't think that's stupid.
I'm glad that I said that.

01:05:23.641 --> 01:05:24.976
Hey, turd-face, guess what?

01:05:25.101 --> 01:05:26.477
I've taken every single one
of your teddy bears,

01:05:26.603 --> 01:05:28.813
and I've stuffed them down my pants.

01:05:28.938 --> 01:05:32.567
Hey, yikes. Sorry.

01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:38.323
For about a month,
my urine smelled like marshmallows.

01:05:38.948 --> 01:05:41.910
<i>Don't wanna close my eyes</i>

01:05:42.535 --> 01:05:47.332
<i>Don't wanna fall asleep</i>
<i>'Cause I miss you Jimmy</i>

01:05:47.665 --> 01:05:51.252
<i>And I don't wanna miss a thing</i>

01:05:52.003 --> 01:05:55.131
<i>So call me back now!</i>

01:05:58.384 --> 01:06:00.929
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

01:06:01.554 --> 01:06:06.434
Hey, it's me again. Jimmy, please,
call me back, so I can explain.

01:06:08.478 --> 01:06:13.316
Wow! Nice work.
Somebody got busy in a big way.

01:06:13.441 --> 01:06:15.193
Scene of the crime.

01:06:15.652 --> 01:06:17.862
For your information,
I didn't have sex with Chazz.

01:06:17.987 --> 01:06:19.405
Fine. "Make love." Whatever.

01:06:19.531 --> 01:06:20.949
I didn't sleep with Chazz.

01:06:21.074 --> 01:06:22.825
- What?
- But congratulations!

01:06:22.951 --> 01:06:25.912
- I feel as slimy as if I had.
- Where do you think you're going?

01:06:26.037 --> 01:06:28.915
To make this right!
Jimmy needs to know the truth!

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.625
You would do that to your own family?

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.001
Don't give me that guilt trip.

01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:35.380
After all we've done for you?
After all you did to Mom and Dad?

01:06:35.505 --> 01:06:37.924
Mom and Dad
were not wearing their seatbelts

01:06:38.049 --> 01:06:41.511
and they made
an improper left-hand turn.

01:06:42.303 --> 01:06:44.681
Come on, Katie, don't go.
We love you and stuff.

01:06:44.806 --> 01:06:47.559
Look, it's up to us, okay?

01:06:47.684 --> 01:06:52.021
We are forced to take Michaels and
MacElroy out of play, no matter what.

01:06:52.146 --> 01:06:54.899
That might require some bad behaviour.

01:06:56.234 --> 01:07:00.738
<i>Hello, and welcome to day three</i>
<i>of the Orbitz World Wintersport Games.</i>

01:07:00.864 --> 01:07:03.491
<i>The best Chinese and Russian pairs</i>
<i>have fallen away,</i>

01:07:03.616 --> 01:07:06.160
<i>setting up</i>
<i>the ultimate gold medal showdown.</i>

01:07:06.286 --> 01:07:11.165
<i>Just two pairs remain. Both American.</i>
<i>Both hell-bent on reaching the top.</i>

01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:15.628
<i>And it's come down to this.</i>
<i>Tonight, they leave it all on the ice.</i>

01:07:15.753 --> 01:07:17.005
<i>The big story here is</i>

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:20.091
<i>the men's pairs figure skating team</i>
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

01:07:20.216 --> 01:07:22.468
These same-gendered sensations
have taken

01:07:22.594 --> 01:07:25.430
centre ice in the hearts of
millions of skating fans everywhere.

01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:27.765
They've literally taken this sport
by storm.

01:07:32.979 --> 01:07:34.022
Jimmy.

01:07:34.272 --> 01:07:37.150
Jimmy's here at the arena, you ass.

01:07:37.817 --> 01:07:41.237
He's been staring at a pack of gum
for nine hours. What'd you do to him?

01:07:41.487 --> 01:07:43.031
I'm on my way.

01:07:48.953 --> 01:07:50.205
Taxi!

01:07:56.127 --> 01:08:00.298
World Wintersport Games.
And yes, I am Chazz Michael Michaels.

01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:03.509
- Hey, Stranz.
- Hi.

01:08:05.929 --> 01:08:10.350
<i>Skaters, please clear the ice</i>
<i>in preparation for the pairs competition.</i>

01:08:24.363 --> 01:08:25.782
Thank you so much.

01:08:26.658 --> 01:08:28.326
Oh, my gosh. Can you...

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:33.122
Sorry, Chazz. Nothing personal.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:37.710
Actually, it's quite the opposite.

01:08:37.835 --> 01:08:41.256
See, your days of
stealing the spotlight are over.

01:08:45.009 --> 01:08:47.011
You crazy bastard!

01:08:55.353 --> 01:08:56.645
Damn it.

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:05.446
What are you doing?

01:09:09.117 --> 01:09:10.785
You are evil. Pure evil!

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.496
Your whole family's evil! Your brother.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.331
And most of all, your sister.

01:09:15.456 --> 01:09:17.834
Don't even think about putting us
in the same league.

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:20.336
If she was half the woman I was,
she would have done her job

01:09:20.461 --> 01:09:22.380
and slept with your partner
like I told her to.

01:09:22.505 --> 01:09:24.090
- She didn't?
- No.

01:09:24.215 --> 01:09:26.551
She couldn't, because of you.

01:09:27.093 --> 01:09:28.636
I don't get it.

01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:34.100
Gross. Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:56.164
Whoever invented rope
was a real a-hole.

01:09:56.789 --> 01:10:01.586
I'm late, sis.
My hair is just not cooperating.

01:10:03.046 --> 01:10:04.589
Oh, crap.

01:10:08.968 --> 01:10:10.136
Okay.

01:10:12.972 --> 01:10:15.183
Who's gonna save you now, Chazz?

01:10:15.308 --> 01:10:19.062
Is Little Lord MacElroy gonna come
and meet you down here?

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:35.537
Oh, great.

01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:50.510
Hey, there!

01:10:50.969 --> 01:10:54.430
What are you doing there?
No. Wait, wait. It's okay. No.

01:10:54.556 --> 01:10:56.808
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

01:10:56.933 --> 01:10:58.643
No, please!

01:11:20.373 --> 01:11:22.333
Let's do it, Chazz!

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:26.588
All right, Stranz.
Time for a little Chazzle Dazzle.

01:11:39.767 --> 01:11:41.102
Beautiful.

01:11:42.979 --> 01:11:44.772
I'm coming, Chazz.

01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:39.619
Give me your hand.

01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:42.247
- I won't hurt you.
- I'm coming for you, Chazz!

01:12:42.372 --> 01:12:44.040
Damn it, Stranz.

01:12:45.124 --> 01:12:47.043
Have you seen Jimmy?
I can't find him anywhere.

01:12:47.168 --> 01:12:48.378
Oh, yeah. He was here a minute ago.

01:12:48.503 --> 01:12:51.506
And if you find him, would you tell him
to get his ass down here?

01:12:59.639 --> 01:13:01.099
I really appreciate this.

01:13:01.224 --> 01:13:05.019
That man who's chasing us
is trying to kill me. So, thanks.

01:13:29.711 --> 01:13:32.839
Who are you supposed to be anyway?
Rod Serling?

01:13:33.298 --> 01:13:34.841
JFK.

01:13:36.342 --> 01:13:40.138
- It's gonna make sense.
- No, no, no. It'll be fine. Yeah.

01:13:41.556 --> 01:13:42.932
That's lame.

01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:49.731
Try to get through that!

01:13:57.071 --> 01:13:58.823
Don't make me kill her.

01:14:10.543 --> 01:14:12.170
Snowflake!

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:56.047
<i>From the United States,</i>

01:14:56.172 --> 01:14:59.717
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

01:15:01.553 --> 01:15:04.847
<i>So, the favourites,</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

01:15:04.973 --> 01:15:06.266
<i>now taking the ice.</i>

01:15:06.391 --> 01:15:08.017
<i>As Marilyn Monroe and JFK,</i>

01:15:08.142 --> 01:15:11.354
<i>they'll be dramatising</i>
<i>a forbidden romance, Jim.</i>

01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:16.150
<i>I take pride in the words,</i>
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

01:15:31.457 --> 01:15:33.877
<i>Calling for preparation on ice</i>
<i>of the United States team</i>

01:15:34.002 --> 01:15:36.004
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

01:15:38.047 --> 01:15:40.216
<i>Well, that was an interesting take</i>
<i>on American history.</i>

01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:42.343
<i>Indeed. I think it's worth noting,</i>

01:15:42.468 --> 01:15:45.847
<i>the fantastic attention to detail</i>
<i>this pair has demonstrated.</i>

01:15:45.972 --> 01:15:49.767
<i>An absolutely seamless use of props</i>
<i>integrated into choreography,</i>

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:53.646
<i>that is both physically impressive</i>
<i>and artistically moving.</i>

01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:56.816
<i>A rare ballet of ice and history.</i>

01:15:56.941 --> 01:16:00.528
<i>And those scores keep Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild in first place,</i>

01:16:00.653 --> 01:16:02.739
but Michaels and MacElroy are up next.

01:16:03.198 --> 01:16:06.910
Coach! Coach! Did I make it in time?
Where's Chazz?

01:16:07.035 --> 01:16:08.161
Where the hell you been?

01:16:08.286 --> 01:16:10.496
Your partner's not here in 30 seconds,
I have to disqualify you.

01:16:10.622 --> 01:16:11.623
I know, I know.

01:16:12.665 --> 01:16:16.961
We're finished. Done. That's it. It's over.
Damn it. Just like that.

01:16:18.046 --> 01:16:20.173
Coach, he'll be here.

01:16:31.976 --> 01:16:33.436
<i>Skaters to the ice.</i>

01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:36.564
<i>Twenty seconds to disqualification.</i>

01:16:36.689 --> 01:16:40.068
<i>Jimmy MacElroy stands alone</i>
<i>at centre ice.</i>

01:16:40.193 --> 01:16:43.321
<i>And you have to wonder</i>
<i>what is going on.</i>

01:16:43.446 --> 01:16:46.533
<i>Well, this is Rice without Montana.</i>

01:16:47.116 --> 01:16:50.828
<i>Ali without Frazier.</i>
<i>Han Solo without Chewbacca.</i>

01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:53.164
Jimmy!

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.045
Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.421
Chazz!

01:17:00.838 --> 01:17:04.634
Hey, I didn't sleep with Katie!

01:17:04.759 --> 01:17:07.512
- I know!
- We didn't even get to second base.

01:17:07.637 --> 01:17:09.556
Well, maybe I did.

01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:12.016
What I felt in my pants
was weird and shameful.

01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:13.810
Okay, we can discuss that later!

01:17:13.935 --> 01:17:14.978
You kind of have to be down here
right now

01:17:15.103 --> 01:17:16.437
or we're gonna be disqualified!

01:17:16.563 --> 01:17:18.356
Katie is not a whore!

01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:21.359
Okay, I get it! Just stop talking!

01:17:21.484 --> 01:17:22.861
Okay! Okay!

01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:24.904
<i>- Skaters to the ice.</i>
- Hold on!

01:17:25.029 --> 01:17:27.657
<i>Ten seconds to disqualification.</i>

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:32.203
Wow.

01:17:39.878 --> 01:17:41.045
Yeah!

01:17:48.887 --> 01:17:52.557
<i>Wow! A dramatic entrance</i>
<i>for Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

01:17:53.516 --> 01:17:55.185
I'm okay!

01:17:56.352 --> 01:17:57.562
I'm all right!

01:18:00.899 --> 01:18:02.192
I'm okay.

01:18:08.198 --> 01:18:10.241
<i>And there's another</i>
<i>unique Michaels skill.</i>

01:18:10.366 --> 01:18:13.620
<i>Out of his clothes in a hurry</i>
<i>when he has to.</i>

01:18:13.745 --> 01:18:14.954
<i>And women's skating champion</i>

01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:17.582
<i>Sasha Cohen</i>
<i>catches Michaels'jock strap.</i>

01:18:17.707 --> 01:18:19.584
I love you, Chazz!

01:18:27.008 --> 01:18:28.885
- I made it.
- I knew you would.

01:18:29.344 --> 01:18:30.595
Let's capture the dream.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.514
Capture the... I love it.
Where'd you come up with that?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.184
- I have no idea where I came up with it.
- Cool.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:38.645
- Let's kick some ice.
- Okay.

01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:46.611
<i>Well, Scott, the boys seem to be</i>
<i>using a science fiction theme tonight.</i>

01:18:46.736 --> 01:18:50.323
<i>Fitting, considering these two men</i>
<i>may very well be the future of the sport.</i>

01:18:50.448 --> 01:18:51.699
<i>Well, I'll tell you something, Jim.</i>

01:18:51.824 --> 01:18:54.202
<i>It's like these two men did</i>
<i>beam in from outer space,</i>

01:18:54.327 --> 01:18:56.621
<i>to flip this sport inside out.</i>

01:19:03.586 --> 01:19:05.129
<i>The lights are on and so is this crowd.</i>

01:19:05.255 --> 01:19:07.799
<i>A Mr Roboto to start the routine.</i>

01:19:10.134 --> 01:19:12.428
<i>And they hit it beautifully!</i>

01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:17.767
<i>Everything they do</i>
<i>is drenched in drama.</i>

01:19:20.854 --> 01:19:23.022
<i>Side-by-side skate clashes.</i>

01:19:33.241 --> 01:19:35.410
<i>And more sparks!</i>
<i>Look at the athleticism here!</i>

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.412
<i>No other pair in the world could do this!</i>

01:19:37.537 --> 01:19:39.914
<i>Fireworks display in Montreal.</i>

01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:41.624
<i>Incredible.</i>

01:19:46.838 --> 01:19:48.089
What are you doing?

01:19:48.214 --> 01:19:51.134
We're freestyling.
You're the steak, I'm the sizzle.

01:19:51.259 --> 01:19:52.260
We didn't practise that.

01:19:52.385 --> 01:19:55.722
Do it for Katie.
Burn up the ice with your red hot love.

01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:12.864
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>turn up the thermostat.</i>

01:20:12.989 --> 01:20:15.867
These guys put the "bone" in Zamboni.

01:20:16.409 --> 01:20:17.619
It's over.

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:19.245
All the endorsements, everything gone.

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:21.664
Oh, my God, I can't get a real job.
It'll kill me.

01:20:21.789 --> 01:20:24.751
God, I have to do everything
in this family.

01:20:37.597 --> 01:20:40.266
<i>A serious stumble</i>
<i>in an otherwise perfect routine.</i>

01:20:40.391 --> 01:20:43.478
<i>Perfection's what they need if</i>
<i>they want to beat Stranz and Fairchild.</i>

01:20:43.603 --> 01:20:45.647
- I think I broke my ankle.
- What?

01:20:45.772 --> 01:20:48.149
I'm gonna put some weight on it to see.

01:20:51.027 --> 01:20:54.155
<i>I don't know, Scott.</i>
<i>I'm not sure, interpretive dance moves</i>

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.823
<i>are gonna win these judges over.</i>

01:20:55.949 --> 01:20:57.992
- What the hell are they doing?
- Something's wrong.

01:20:58.117 --> 01:21:00.703
I can't do the Lotus
with a shattered ankle.

01:21:00.828 --> 01:21:03.164
I'm just a man, for God's sake.

01:21:04.374 --> 01:21:05.625
We'll switch places.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:08.127
I swear to God, if you cut my head off.

01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:13.174
They're going for the Iron Lotus,
in reverse.

01:21:13.299 --> 01:21:15.760
My God.
This is happening all over again.

01:21:19.055 --> 01:21:21.558
<i>They're picking up speed</i>
<i>for something spectacular.</i>

01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:23.768
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>they might be trying something</i>

01:21:23.893 --> 01:21:25.436
<i>I have never seen done.</i>

01:21:25.562 --> 01:21:28.022
<i>It is the fabled Iron Lotus.</i>

01:21:28.147 --> 01:21:31.651
No! Don't do it! I was wrong!
It's suicide!

01:22:16.112 --> 01:22:19.407
<i>And they nail it!</i>
<i>Unbelievable performance!</i>

01:22:19.532 --> 01:22:22.202
<i>This crowd is going wild!</i>
<i>They're on their feet!</i>

01:22:22.327 --> 01:22:26.664
<i>I never thought I'd see it with</i>
<i>my own eyes, the fabled Iron Lotus!</i>

01:22:26.789 --> 01:22:29.918
<i>A historic event here in Montreal.</i>

01:22:30.043 --> 01:22:33.087
Michaels and MacElroy
have brought the legend to life.

01:22:33.338 --> 01:22:35.298
Scott, I seem to have wet my pants.

01:22:35.423 --> 01:22:37.383
Chazz, Chazz. We did it!

01:22:37.884 --> 01:22:40.011
- Did we win?
- I don't know.

01:22:40.637 --> 01:22:42.722
I think I see the Virgin Mary.

01:22:42.847 --> 01:22:44.557
No. That's not her.

01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:52.065
We got you, Mr Michaels. Let's go.

01:22:54.442 --> 01:22:55.985
- Oh, I don't wanna die.
- You'll be okay.

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:59.489
- I don't wanna die.
- Take a huff of that. Here we go.

01:22:59.614 --> 01:23:01.157
I'm gonna have to cut your pants off.

01:23:01.282 --> 01:23:04.869
Okay, but start up near the crotch.
That's a better access point.

01:23:17.549 --> 01:23:18.800
You were incredible.

01:23:18.925 --> 01:23:22.345
Really?
I thought my landing was all bad...

01:23:27.267 --> 01:23:28.977
You've been practising.

01:23:29.102 --> 01:23:31.312
Chazz taught me some stuff.

01:23:44.492 --> 01:23:46.035
Stranz Van Waldenberg.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.956
You're under arrest for the desecration
of an international icon.

01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:51.374
Snowflake.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.503
- It was her idea. She broke his ankle!
- What?

01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:57.881
You idiot!

01:23:58.006 --> 01:23:59.424
I hate you.

01:24:06.598 --> 01:24:08.224
Come on now. Let's get out of here.

01:24:08.349 --> 01:24:10.518
And that's why I was a sex addict.

01:24:10.643 --> 01:24:12.937
Because no one ever loved me.

01:24:13.646 --> 01:24:16.274
But I learned something here today.

01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:19.527
That ice doesn't belong here.

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:22.405
It belongs out there.

01:24:22.655 --> 01:24:25.950
Out on the ice in an ice rink.

01:24:27.035 --> 01:24:29.245
I never had a father, okay?

01:24:29.746 --> 01:24:31.414
But I don't care!

01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:34.167
Because now I've got a brother.

01:24:36.252 --> 01:24:37.962
This is my brother!

01:24:38.254 --> 01:24:41.049
And this is my brother's new girlfriend.

01:24:42.759 --> 01:24:44.802
And she is not a whore.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.389
I'm in a lot of pain.
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:51.351
Chazz, they got to get you to a hospital.
Come on.

01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:55.271
No. And miss the smell of sweet gold?

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.608
Not on your life.

01:25:10.745 --> 01:25:11.955
Thank you.

01:25:14.666 --> 01:25:18.294
Jimmy, you did it!
The gold medal, baby! You did it!

01:25:18.419 --> 01:25:21.297
I wanna wear the gold medal, naked.

01:25:22.006 --> 01:25:23.424
Thank you.

01:25:30.598 --> 01:25:34.686
I've got something I wanna show you.
I had it done last weekend.

01:25:37.897 --> 01:25:42.318
That's you,
the wolf that runs with the Lone Wolf.

01:25:42.443 --> 01:25:45.822
So that the Lone Wolf
never has to be alone again.

01:25:45.947 --> 01:25:47.991
That's how much you mean to me, bro.

01:25:48.116 --> 01:25:49.492
You were drunk when you got it,
weren't you?

01:25:49.617 --> 01:25:51.703
Yes. Absolutely hammered.

01:25:52.579 --> 01:25:54.956
- Welcome to the pack.
- Thanks.

01:25:56.499 --> 01:25:58.084
Let's get outta here.

01:25:58.209 --> 01:25:59.669
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.865
USA!

01:27:52.365 --> 01:27:55.869
The gold medal has been won
by Jimmy and Chazz,

01:27:55.994 --> 01:27:58.329
thanks to Hector's idea!

01:27:58.997 --> 01:28:00.415
We did it, Hector!

01:28:00.582 --> 01:28:02.375
Boom! We sure did.

01:28:02.834 --> 01:28:05.378
Thank you, Hector. He did it for us.

01:28:06.045 --> 01:28:07.547
Where is Hector?

01:28:07.672 --> 01:28:10.425
Here I am, guys. We did it. High-fives.

01:28:10.884 --> 01:28:13.761
Cool. Way to go, guys. Gold medal.

01:28:13.887 --> 01:28:16.764
You guys are the best. Hey, Jimmy?

01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:18.474
Yeah, Hector?

01:28:18.933 --> 01:28:21.144
Can you give me a time-out here
with Chazz?

01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:22.854
Yeah, sure. Are you crying?

01:28:22.979 --> 01:28:24.731
No. I'm fine.

01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:28.735
Okay. I'll go over here. Sandwich.

01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:31.112
Hey. Chazz?

01:28:31.613 --> 01:28:33.323
What is it? Boom.

01:28:33.448 --> 01:28:36.492
I just wanna say
you guys are partners now.

01:28:36.993 --> 01:28:38.703
I've been friends with him forever,

01:28:38.828 --> 01:28:40.997
and you take good care of him.

01:28:41.122 --> 01:28:42.665
I will. Boom.

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:44.751
He just, he loves food.

01:28:44.876 --> 01:28:47.754
And he likes dreams and whispers

01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:50.340
and his favourite movie is <i>Short Circuit</i>

01:28:50.465 --> 01:28:52.425
and <i>Fried Green Tomatoes.</i>

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:55.261
And just watch over him. All right?

01:28:55.386 --> 01:28:58.306
I will. Boom.
You have my word. High-five.

01:28:58.973 --> 01:29:00.475
God bless you.

01:29:00.934 --> 01:29:03.228
Sweet. Jimmy, you can come back.

01:29:03.353 --> 01:29:05.230
What you guys were talking about?

01:29:05.355 --> 01:29:07.273
Just stuff, you know.

01:29:07.398 --> 01:29:09.609
Hey, guys, you're amazing.

01:29:09.734 --> 01:29:12.278
I just wanna say keep dreaming

01:29:12.654 --> 01:29:15.406
because there's a lot of dreams
to be had.

01:29:15.532 --> 01:29:16.824
USA.

01:29:19.118 --> 01:29:20.411
USA.
