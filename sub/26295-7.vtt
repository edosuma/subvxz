.

00:04.395 --> 00:06.049
- I'm sorry, Nat,

00:06.093 --> 00:07.311
I just gotta do something quick
for Jay.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.791
I'm gonna be
a few minutes late.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.141
Thanks.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.534
Hey, why didn't you call 911?

00:12.577 --> 00:14.144
- We called you.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.364
- Hi, Ray.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.756
So what made you fall?

00:17.800 --> 00:21.064
- I took one look at
that carburetor...

00:21.108 --> 00:22.631
- Can you tell me
how old you are?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.198
- 62.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.330
- Come on, Will.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.727
- It's...
It's, uh...

00:31.770 --> 00:33.120
I can't remember.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.947
- Your eye movement's
a little sluggish.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.211
I need to get you
to the hospital for an MRI.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.517
- Happy to do it,
first thing tomorrow.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.692
- Ray.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.043
- So he's got
a bridge game today

00:43.086 --> 00:45.088
with some friends that--

00:45.132 --> 00:46.307
hasn't seen in a while.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.699
- Look at your father.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.440
He could be having
a stroke right now.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.529
If he is and we don't
get him to the hospital,

00:51.573 --> 00:53.531
he could die.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.881
I'll get you in and out
in an hour.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.187
An hour?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.407
- Promise.

00:59.450 --> 01:02.366
- Fine, get my stuff.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.066
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

01:06.109 --> 01:08.590
- All right, there we are.
Okay.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.679
- An hour.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.424
- Em, you sure you should be
going to Vegas?

01:16.467 --> 01:17.990
I mean, you did meet in AA.

01:18.034 --> 01:21.255
- Ethan, Bernie has a lead
on a really good job.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.387
I mean,
we're gonna buy a house.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.867
Look, I know
you're worried about me,

01:24.910 --> 01:26.216
but everything's gonna be okay.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.263
- Em, he has pancreatitis.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.916
You have to keep
his drain clean.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.266
Check his glucose
every four hours.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.745
It's a lot of work.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.312
- I know.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.401
- Well, if we're gonna
get to Omaha by dinner,

01:37.445 --> 01:38.881
we gotta hit the road.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.710
- We will.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.407
- And, Bernie--
- Don't worry, Doc.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.627
I'll be checking my glucose.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.762
- Thanks for everything.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.858
- I will.

02:11.609 --> 02:15.309
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah, of course.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.966
- See you at work.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.230
- Yeah.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.372
- Hey, haven't seen
your big, red shadow today.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.634
- Yeah, he's running
a little late.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.854
Oh, hey, um...

02:38.897 --> 02:41.509
- Have you noticed Will
acting a little weird lately?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.206
- He is getting married
in a month.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.295
Makes most men act
a little weird.

02:45.339 --> 02:48.603
- Yeah, I guess.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.825
- Heard Emily left.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.218
- Oh, yeah.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.006
- Nothing.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.399
- Yeah.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.010
- Emily was the only thing
keeping you two apart.

03:05.054 --> 03:09.667
- She actually just made
our problems more obvious.

03:09.711 --> 03:13.018
Really, there's nothing left
between me and Ethan.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.282
- If you say so.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.240
Dr. Choi,

03:17.284 --> 03:19.199
there's a patient
in Treatment Four

03:19.242 --> 03:21.070
that's insisting to see you.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.506
You know him?

03:22.550 --> 03:24.682
- Don't think so,
but I'll check him out.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.207
- All right, then.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.125
- Mr. Patrick,

03:33.169 --> 03:34.344
hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.520
What brings you in today?

03:36.564 --> 03:38.522
- I was looking
for Dr. Ethan Choi.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.437
Is that you?
- Yeah.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.048
And why are you looking
for me specifically?

03:43.092 --> 03:47.270
- Do you recall seeing
my wife here a year ago?

03:47.314 --> 03:50.926
Megan Patrick?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.494
- I'm sorry,
not off the top of my head.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.364
Why?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.760
- 'Cause you're the doctor
that killed her.

you remember.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.349
Just give me the facts.

04:22.392 --> 04:25.526
- I understand...

04:25.569 --> 04:27.963
but first,
I just want you to know

04:28.006 --> 04:30.400
that I realize you've been
through something truly awful--

04:30.444 --> 04:33.708
- Sit down.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.714
Just tell me what happened.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.760
- Okay, Mr. Patrick,

04:42.804 --> 04:45.415
but I have to look up
her chart.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.983
- Go--go ahead.

04:52.030 --> 04:55.120
- Man, those vanilla lattes
never get old, do they?

04:55.164 --> 04:56.992
- Why do people think drinking
black coffee makes them cool?

04:57.035 --> 04:59.081
- We don't, we are cool,
so we drink black coffee.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.351
- I do have one final question.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
How you feeling?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.877
Second trimester,
and a lot better.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.226
Thank you.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.793

- Connor, hello.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.972
Hello, Dr. Bekker.

05:21.016 --> 05:24.106
- You are a little far
from your office, aren't you?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.849
I have a seat on the board now.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.765
I guess we'll be seeing
more of each other.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.810
- Great.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.381
Hey, Ms. Garrett.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.775
- Can you tell me why

05:40.818 --> 05:42.777
my father has a seat
on the hospital board?

05:42.820 --> 05:44.300
- Well,
it's the least we can do

05:44.344 --> 05:45.997
after he donated
all that money.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.131
- The money for...

05:49.174 --> 05:50.959
Wait...

05:51.002 --> 05:54.179
Is he the principal donor
for the Hybrid OR?

05:54.223 --> 05:56.878
- Nice having a rich dad.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.621
- Unbelievable.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.449
He is always trying
to undercut me,

06:02.492 --> 06:04.276
trying to have some kind of
power over me.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.843
- Oh...

06:05.887 --> 06:09.891
- Wait a second,
did you know?

06:09.934 --> 06:13.155
You knew
and you didn't tell me.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.810
So instead, you lie to me,
to my face for weeks?

06:15.853 --> 06:17.638
- I didn't lie.
I just didn't mention it.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.162
- No, Ava, that is a lie.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.468
That's great.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.427
Thank you very much.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.477
- Your wife was admitted
to the ED at 7:12 a.m.

06:30.520 --> 06:35.264
Her blood pressure was 104/62,
heart rate 87.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.441
- Dr. Manning, you're going
to Treatment Three.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.660
Monique, go with her.

06:41.313 --> 06:44.012
- Claire Burton, ran her bike
into a car on Michigan Avenue.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.230
Vitals stable.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.449
Can't get any answers
out of her,

06:46.493 --> 06:47.929
but she definitely looks
pregnant.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.670
- Claire, I'm Dr. Manning,
do you remember me?

06:49.713 --> 06:50.975
- I used to eat a lot
of carrots...

06:51.019 --> 06:52.412
- Dr. Charles.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.891
- But, you know, they don't
really help your eyes

06:53.935 --> 06:55.458
I don't really need
them anyway...

06:55.502 --> 06:57.155
- Yes, bipolar.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.680
I treated her a few months ago
for morning sickness.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.203
All right,
let's move her on my count.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.857
Ready, one, two, three.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.338
- As far as I know,
boyfriend's out of the picture.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.688
- Oh, my gosh.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.385
Sometimes, if I look
at something for too long,

07:09.429 --> 07:10.821
I feel like all that energy
is gonna turn into a laser

07:10.865 --> 07:12.388
and just burn a hole
right though

07:12.432 --> 07:13.650
whatever it is
that I'm looking at.

07:13.694 --> 07:14.782
I heal a lot faster
than others...

07:14.825 --> 07:16.610
- Claire,
does it hurt anywhere?

07:16.653 --> 07:18.350
- Two Haldol, please.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.222
- A lot of times I try not
to look at anything but myself.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.833
- Claire, Claire, can you
tell me if anything hurts?

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
- Every single molecule
on my skin is something...

07:24.531 --> 07:25.793
- She'll calm down in
a couple minutes.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.403
I'm right outside.
- Okay, thank you.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.839
- And I just heal.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.450
Does anybody know what happened
to my bike?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.147
This--it's just a little bit
of a cut.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.454
Maybe--I could just get
my bike and go.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.073
Ray's gonna be here any minute.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.336
- Our tail has him
seven minutes out.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.642
You need to call off the MRI.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.732
- That bridge game
is the summit

07:51.775 --> 07:53.560
between Ray and his crew
that we've been waiting for.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.084
This is where he's going
to incriminate himself.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.781
- So I'll do one test
and send him home.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.348
- Listen, you work for us

07:59.391 --> 08:01.089
and I am telling you
to call it off.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.873
- I work for the hospital,

08:02.917 --> 08:06.442
and he needs an MRI,
so he's gonna get one.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.531
- We can make your life
very hard.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.229
♪

08:11.273 --> 08:16.147
Make sure you get him home
for that meeting.

08:27.332 --> 08:30.771

from Dr. Choi's patient.

08:30.814 --> 08:34.644
- I'll check it out.
- Yeah.

08:34.688 --> 08:38.169
- O2 sats, 86%.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.304
- No.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.611
We're fine in here, thanks.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.874
- All right.

08:48.658 --> 08:49.964
Yeah, something's up.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.618
Ethan wouldn't even
let me in the room.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.010
- Okay,
I'll call security

08:53.054 --> 08:55.578
and have them keep an eye
on them.

08:58.189 --> 09:02.150
- Derek Glenn, 35 MVC,
BP 110/60,

09:02.193 --> 09:05.066
heart rate's 120,
left upper quadrant pain.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.329
It's not a treatment room.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.852
- I was told to park him here

09:08.896 --> 09:10.637
because all the other rooms
are full.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.335
- All right.
Let's get an ultrasound.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.206
Hey there, Derek,

09:15.250 --> 09:17.426
can you tell me where it hurts?

09:17.469 --> 09:20.821
- Right here.
- All right.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.692
Is there anyone
you need us to call?

09:22.736 --> 09:24.259
- Already called my wife.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.610
- Good.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.873
Well,
it looks like you've got

09:29.917 --> 09:32.180
some free fluid around
your spleen.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.226
That usually indicates
a small tear,

09:35.270 --> 09:37.881
which we do sometimes see
with blunt trauma.

09:37.925 --> 09:43.147
Now, the good news is 90% of
these bleeds stop on their own.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.542
So for now I'd just like to get
a scan to confirm,

09:46.586 --> 09:48.631
and then we'll keep
a close eye on you

09:48.675 --> 09:49.937
to make sure
that you're stable.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.982
That sound okay?
- Yeah, sure.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.505
- Good.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.552
Let's get him a CBC, CMP,
coag panel,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.119
type and cross
four units of blood,

09:58.162 --> 09:59.860
and set him up for a CT.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.383
We will get you all set up,

10:01.426 --> 10:04.778
and then I'll be back to check
in on you soon, okay?

10:09.130 --> 10:12.394
- Look, about this morning.
- I don't want to hear it.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.570
- So what if your father's
the main donor?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.876
This hybrid room
has been a godsend.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.051
- That's not the point.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.661
- You're saving lives with it.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.315
Who cares where
the money came from?

10:20.358 --> 10:21.708
- I do,

10:21.751 --> 10:23.710
and you should know me
well enough to know

10:23.753 --> 10:26.321
that I don't want to be
beholden to my father.

10:26.364 --> 10:30.325
- Connor--
- You should have told me.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.550
- How many more damn papers
do I got to sign?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.726
- That's it.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.162
We're gonna get this done
right now.

10:41.205 --> 10:44.905
- About time.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.341
- Let's get this done fast,
okay?

10:46.384 --> 10:50.606
- It's a head MRI.
It takes as long as it takes.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.653
- Let's lay you down.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.611
- Ray, I got to see
some more patients,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.047
but I'll be back before
you're done.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.788
- Yeah.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.449
- What was her normal
dose of Quetiapine?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.016
- It was 800 milligrams,

11:09.059 --> 11:11.279
but I cut it in half
to be safe for the baby.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.108
- Huh, that might explain
the onset of the mania.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.153
- Well, the standard of care
is to cut the dose in half.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.938
- There's actually been
some new research,

11:17.981 --> 11:19.635
a couple of new papers,
both suggesting--

11:19.679 --> 11:22.638
- Dr. Charles, I can't keep up
with every psychiatric journal.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.031
- Course you can't.

11:24.074 --> 11:27.469
- I didn't have a choice.
I did what I had to do.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.298
- Dr. Manning.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.480
- Your placenta must have
abrupted from the accident.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.917
Call OB, we need to get
her upstairs for a delivery.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.440
- Delivery--did something
happen to my baby?

11:42.484 --> 11:44.268
Is he gonna be okay?
What's wrong with my baby?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.749
- Everything's gonna be fine.
Let's get you upstairs,

11:46.793 --> 11:48.185
and then we'll figure out
what happens next, okay?

11:48.229 --> 11:49.752
- Are you sure
I didn't hurt the baby?

11:49.796 --> 11:52.755
Are you sure?
What if I hurt it?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
- Your wife was given
anti-histamine,

11:54.801 --> 11:56.890
steroids, and epinephrine,

11:56.933 --> 11:58.848
but progressed
to cardiac arrest.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.808
I performed CPR with ACLS
for 35 minutes,

12:01.851 --> 12:06.682
but she never regained
circulation...

12:06.726 --> 12:10.773
and at 9:17,
she was pronounced dead.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.345
- Mr. Patrick.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.782
I assure you,
we did everything we could.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.131
- No.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.003
- I can only imagine
the pain you felt.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.048
- She couldn't breathe.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.529
Do you know what's that like?

12:27.572 --> 12:29.879
I want you to know

pressure ventilation.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.755
We're safe as long

13:30.897 --> 13:33.247
Why did we stop?

14:12.895 --> 14:15.158

workup when you land.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.769

third-degree burns.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.641
Take 'em straight
to the burn center.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.382

upstairs before the spill.

They're renovating
the rehab floor.

A lot more blood.

I killed him.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.861
- A little.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.950
- That means

The tear in your spleen isn't
clotting like I'd hoped.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.998

His pressure's going up.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.080
I think the medicine's working.

34:42.123 --> 34:45.257
- All right, get him upstairs.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.963
- Two units of PRBC are up.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.840
- The surgery got
a little complicated,

35:03.884 --> 35:05.625
but you're gonna be fine.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.236
In fact, your wife is waiting
for you in the ICU.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.064
They're gonna
get you up to her,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.762
and I'll be there to meet you
in just a minute.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.957
Here you go.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.961
- You know I hate peanuts.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.442
- Well, as long as
you're not allergic, right?

35:43.053 --> 35:46.274
What you did back there...

35:46.318 --> 35:48.494
you were incredible.

35:48.537 --> 35:52.367
Derek's alive because of you...

35:54.891 --> 35:57.590
So thank you.

35:57.633 --> 36:00.767
- Wait.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.508
About your father.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.249
- No, forget it, Ava.

36:04.292 --> 36:07.252
I-I had no right to get upset
with you like that.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.950
- I'm sorry--
- No, Connor.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.344
It was me.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.128
I was the one who asked
your father

36:14.172 --> 36:16.391
to donate to the Hybrid Room.

36:17.784 --> 36:22.702
- You were taking that job
at the Mayo Clinic.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.835
I didn't want to lose you.

36:56.649 --> 36:57.954

36:57.998 --> 37:01.654
Were you exposed
to the cyanide?

37:01.697 --> 37:02.916
- Maybe.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.265
- Let's get you back inside.
Come on.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.311
Let's go.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.968
- April, the ICU just called.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.318
Dr. Choi's improving.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.710
- Oh, thank God.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.886
- Go on, go up there.
I'll cover your patients.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.149
- Okay.

37:19.193 --> 37:21.369
Hey, you know,
what I said earlier

37:21.413 --> 37:24.242
about there being
nothing left between us.

37:24.285 --> 37:28.202
I was wrong.
- I knew that.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.781
- Hey, you're up.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.610
- Yeah.

37:44.653 --> 37:49.092
- So it turns out
it's not cyanide.

37:49.136 --> 37:52.095
It's an ulcer.

37:53.706 --> 37:54.968
- Huh.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.405
- Did you know this
was happening?

37:57.449 --> 37:58.667
- I had no idea.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.063
Are you stressed?

38:03.106 --> 38:04.630
- No.

38:04.673 --> 38:08.242
Because I have to say you've
not been yourself lately.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.288
- Natalie,
most ulcers are bacterial.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.986
They're not stress-related--
- I know that.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.901
With the way you've been
acting, it is not--

38:14.944 --> 38:16.990
- There's nothing going on.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.864
- I'll go get your antibiotics.

38:21.908 --> 38:25.128
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

38:28.523 --> 38:32.310
- Is there something
you're not telling me?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.314
- No.

38:38.664 --> 38:41.362
Everything's fine.

38:42.798 --> 38:45.323
- Okay.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.605
- Vicki.

39:06.648 --> 39:08.563
- Hey.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.439
I got a call from the hospital.

39:14.482 --> 39:18.225
Apparently you haven't updated
your emergency contact.

39:18.268 --> 39:21.576
Are you okay?

39:21.620 --> 39:25.145
- I will be.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.756
Are you back in town?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.976
- Couple months now.

39:30.019 --> 39:33.632
I'm back at the VA.

39:33.675 --> 39:37.157
I should have called--
- It's okay.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.725
Glad to see you.

39:44.207 --> 39:48.124
So how was Germany?

39:48.168 --> 39:50.518
- It was good.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.956
I've had enough bratwurst
to last me a lifetime,

39:54.000 --> 39:58.657
but my skiing has
vastly improved, so...

39:58.700 --> 39:59.962
- That's good.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.531
I see you're still funny
