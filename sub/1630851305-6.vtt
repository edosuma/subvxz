Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.711 --> 00:03.545
Give me your number,

00:03.628 --> 00:05.296
-in case I have to tap your phone.
-Fine.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.675
-We should have dinner. It's not a date.
-Dinner?

00:08.758 --> 00:12.345
I had dinner with Jess, David, Kevin, and
Sarah. Had a great time. It was like...

00:12.429 --> 00:14.639
-Family?
-Yeah. I never really had that.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.267
I haven't painted
or drawn anything for years.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.978
-We'll be okay. We'll have one.
-You want a family.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.105
[Evan] They found these
on the hotel building site?

00:22.188 --> 00:24.023
This could cause a work stoppage.

00:24.107 --> 00:28.611
This law firm spied on a junior associate
to get intel on his family. I quit.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.113
Thank you very much.

00:32.323 --> 00:36.036
["Canon in D" playing]

00:47.839 --> 00:51.801
[clears throat]
David, do you take Jess to be your wife?

00:52.343 --> 00:55.096
Do you promise to honor, cherish,

00:55.805 --> 00:57.307
and protect her forevermore?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.100
-I-- [yells]
-David!

01:10.320 --> 01:11.321
Hey, hon.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.867
You had that dream again, didn't you?

01:16.618 --> 01:19.913
This time
the earth opened up under your feet.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.415
Better than the time
I was carried off by seagulls.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.419
I can't wait for this wedding to be over
so I can have a good night's sleep again.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.075
Well, people do change.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.995
-We're having dinner tonight.
-Mm. A date?

02:42.787 --> 02:44.164
No, not a date. Just, um...

02:44.664 --> 02:47.458
Just discussing the curriculum
over dinner.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.210
Educator to educator.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.129
Fine, just make sure
he picks up the check.

02:51.921 --> 02:52.755
Okay.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.173
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.968
I know what you're all thinking,
the wedding is only a week away.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.554
But, please, don't get crazy.

02:59.637 --> 03:04.601
Carry on as if it was just a normal week.
That's what David and I are going to do.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.186
Because a week
is plenty of time to get everything done.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.314
So just don't panic, okay?

03:09.397 --> 03:10.315
Nobody panic!

03:11.065 --> 03:11.900
Okay.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.486
-Ooh! She's panicking.
-So much panicking.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.489
-[Megan] Hey. Morning.
-Morning.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.407
So, Connor,

03:20.575 --> 03:22.744
how long have you been wearing that, uh...

03:23.953 --> 03:24.787
ensemble?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.372
I changed...

03:27.790 --> 03:28.625
my shirt...

03:30.293 --> 03:31.961
the other day.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.171
That's good.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.714
Very good.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.009
He's just happy that he doesn't have to
get dressed and go to the office. Right?

03:38.092 --> 03:40.637
So he should be.
But it's been three weeks.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.055
Two and a half.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.182
I appreciate what you did for me,

03:44.265 --> 03:47.101
-but don't you think you ought to be--
-Planning for my future?

03:47.769 --> 03:48.853
I'm all over that.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.147
In fact, I lie awake at night

03:51.231 --> 03:55.818
staring at the ceiling,
thinking about nothing but that.

03:57.028 --> 04:01.741
Con, it's only natural
to feel a little down at a time like this.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.659
I guess.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.747
I mean, what I thought was my dream job,

04:07.830 --> 04:12.168
turned out to be
a conference room full of snakes.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.628
Oh.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.421
You need a hug.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.048
What? No. I'm not 8 years old.

04:17.131 --> 04:18.508
[Megan] You don't want a hug?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.177
I kind of want a hug.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.679
I know.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.310
[Master Amy] Very good.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.730
Good job.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.192
Now bow to your partners.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.404
Abby.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.702
Now, this is a little advanced,
but I wanna see what you can do.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.664
Very nice.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.457
[Evan] Very impressive.

04:53.584 --> 04:57.380
You're late. Class, this is Evan.
He's thinking about joining our class.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.884
-What are you doing here?
-I like to try new things.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.553
Why don't you just observe for a while?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.722
Oh. I'm a quick learner. I can jump in.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.851
Have you taken tae kwon do before?

05:09.934 --> 05:12.478
No, but I am familiar
with the martial arts.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.607
I've studied Muay Thai, Krav Maga, savate.
So, you know, the basics.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.235
Well, sounds like
you could teach us a thing or two.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.070
No, I'm just a student.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.866
Well, we were doing basic arm blocks.
Why don't you show him, Abby?

05:24.949 --> 05:25.783

05:25.867 --> 05:29.370
"You learn best by teaching."
Isn't that right, Master Amy?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.663
You've read my book?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.790
He has people who do research.

05:32.874 --> 05:33.791
I do.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.836
I've also watched videos
on the Internet, so I'm a leg up on this.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.921
Well, then let's keep going. Abby?

05:48.014 --> 05:48.848
Very nice.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.393
Remember, we're not ready to spar yet.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.105
Sorry. Sorry, instincts.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.107
Okay, my turn.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.401
-Bring it on.
-Are you ready?

Uh-oh.

Evan, I'm so sorry.
I thought you were gonna duck.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.750
-No worries. And I will from now on.
-Let me see.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.628
-Oh...
-Looks cool, huh?

06:19.378 --> 06:20.630
I mean this as a compliment.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.591
-But you kick like an angry mule.
-I'm so sorry.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.177
You said that already.
It's okay, Abby, really.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.930
-I see your class was eventful, sir.
-Ask her.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.017
I really-- I didn't mean to do it.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.185

06:49.033 --> 06:51.035
Oh, no, it's my fault.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.745
You look pretty dangerous there.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.830
Oh, yes, right.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.414
New hobby?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.749
Yeah, I just started.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.085
Wow. Like daughters, like mother.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.712
Must feel good to kick something.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.466
I thought it would, but turns out
I don't know my own strength.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.051
I sure wouldn't mess with you.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.471
So how you doing?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.640
-Still feeling stressed?
-Uh...

07:14.350 --> 07:19.564
Yeah, Evan Kincaid is driving me crazy.
I might have just given him a concussion.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.024
-That's an interesting business strategy.
-No.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.652
See, it was not my fault.
We were in class--

07:24.735 --> 07:27.572
Oh, wait,
Kincaid is taking tae kwon do with you?

07:27.655 --> 07:31.492
Yes. He just shows up
and starts taking lessons. Who does that?

07:31.576 --> 07:32.535
Interesting.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.538
He does stuff like that all the time.
He's so impulsive.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.458
He has no attention span.
He's always interested in new things.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.375
Abby...

07:40.293 --> 07:44.589
did you stop to think that maybe
the new thing he's interested in is you?

07:45.923 --> 07:47.925
No. No, no, it's not like that.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.012
I'm gonna stop talking.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.056
No, don't stop. I enjoy talking with you.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.058
Well, I like talking to you too.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.477
We should do it again.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.312
Over lunch or dinner.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.274
-Like a date?
-I don't like to put labels on things.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.027
I would like that.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.112
Great. Great.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.449
Um, check your schedule, have your people
get in touch with my people.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.700
Okay. I'll do that.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.372
Oh, and, uh, I'll be sure to call
if I need somebody kicked.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.750

-Okay.

Uh, well, as you can see by the broom
in my hand, I'm top management.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.394
Don't forget us little people.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.395
Oh, I won't.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.857
Hey, I, uh, read your book this weekend.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.025
You did?

08:46.108 --> 08:50.738
Yeah. I got a library card, checked it out
and everything. It was terrific.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.906
Thank you.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.409
Of course, growing up here, I could see
who the thinly veiled characters were.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.453
-Yeah.
-How'd the family take it?

08:58.955 --> 09:01.791
Turned out it was
a little too thinly veiled.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.750
Hm.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
They came around.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.045
It, uh, helps that it was a bestseller.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.006
-Still can't believe that.
-Oh, I can believe it.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.928
-So how's the class coming along?
-Oh, I haven't started yet.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.638
Um...

09:16.764 --> 09:17.848
I'm a bit nervous.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.725
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.312
Well, just act confident.
The rest will take care of itself.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.397
You think so?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.065
Oh, what do I know? I'm holding a broom.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.733

09:29.527 --> 09:30.361
Are you okay?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.490
Watch how confidently
I switch from a broom to a mop.

-[woman] Oh!
-See you, Bree.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.579
-Here. You-- Yeah. Okay.
-[waitress] Thanks.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.456
Yeah, I look forward
to working with you again too.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.041
Thanks so much. Bye-bye.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.962
This was the fourth call today
about the mitigation.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.381
-That Dilpher pays for.
-Every dime.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.383
-You deserve it, Dad.
-Thank you.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.510
You look nice.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.346
Wearing hard pants, I see.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.682
-Well, it was time.
-Mm.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.603
Listen, I know that Denzer,
Lewis and Phelps was your dream job.

10:04.979 --> 10:05.980
I thought it was.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.734
Would you have walked away
if it hadn't been about me?

10:10.401 --> 10:11.235
I hope so.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.364
But... being about you
made it a lot easier.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.659
Well, I'm very proud of you for doing it.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.952
Thanks, Dad.

10:20.036 --> 10:24.665
Oh, and, uh... I think you're gonna be
a great success on your own.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.418
That is the intention.
First stop, office space.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.545
Yes, and when it comes to real estate,
don't forget...

10:29.629 --> 10:31.464
Location, location, location.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.381
That's right.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.800
What's your favorite novel?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.970
Oh, it's a tie. Anna Karenina and
All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.430
Good choices.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.931
Um...

10:41.015 --> 10:44.769
If you could be alive
at any point in history, when would it be?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.604
Hm...

10:47.605 --> 10:48.439
Now.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.357
I like now.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.777
Okay. Um...

10:52.860 --> 10:55.446
What's your favorite band
or favorite kind of music?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.531
-Country.
-What? Really?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.533
-Yeah, really.
-[laughs]

10:59.617 --> 11:03.037
Have you ever listened to it?
Like really listened to the good stuff.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.790
-Is there good stuff?
-Oh, wow.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.375
Don't be a snob.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.671
You should, uh,
come to Chesapeake Shores sometime.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.840
Go to a little club called The Bridge.
They have great...

11:14.924 --> 11:18.052
They have all kinds of great music,
but really good country.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.638
Okay. I just might try that.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.557
-How about next weekend?
-Oh, next weekend's bad.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.934
My sister's getting married.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.520
For real, or is that just an excuse?

11:28.104 --> 11:32.066
No, it's for real.
Who would make up an excuse like that?

11:32.149 --> 11:35.236
Someone who wants
a really good excuse, I guess.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.154
I'm not really looking for one.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.072
-No?
-No.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.492
-Okay.
-In fact, I have a plus-one

11:41.575 --> 11:43.119
in case you wanna come check.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.538
Is that an invite?

11:45.621 --> 11:49.125
No. Maybe it's just an excuse
for somebody that really wants to come.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.419
Well, um...

11:51.502 --> 11:52.753
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.922
Well, um...

11:56.257 --> 11:57.216
I would love to.

11:58.968 --> 11:59.802
Oh.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.886
Yeah.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.388
Of course.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.306
-That's great.
-Good.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.724
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.232
Um, okay then.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.943
-I'll see you.
-Good.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.987
-There. Then.
-Yeah. Okay.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.196
-Just let me know.
-Uh-huh.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.865
-Okay.
-Mm-hm.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.616
-Bye.
-Um, drive safe.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.702
Thank you so much for the food.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.370
Yeah. That was nice.

12:27.705 --> 12:28.539
Okay.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.960
["Canon in D" playing]

12:33.043 --> 12:35.504
David, do you take Jess to be your wife?

12:36.505 --> 12:41.343
Do you promise to love, honor,
cherish, and protect her forevermore?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.220
I do.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.723
[yells]

12:46.599 --> 12:47.433
Okay.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.768
I should have seen that coming.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.897
[tranquil music playing]

12:57.401 --> 12:58.903
[Evan] Okay, I only have a few minutes.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.905
I have to leave
for a meeting in Reykjavík.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.282
Did you address
my concerns about the air conditioning?

13:03.365 --> 13:06.619
Yes. All taken care of.
Your guests will be properly cool.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.536
Good.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.540
What is this?
I said I wanted to add three more floors.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.254
I thought you were kidding. Do you have
any idea how much that will cost?

13:17.338 --> 13:20.758
And, also, if you keep adding floors,
will it still be a "boutique" hotel?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.968
It'll be whatever I say it is.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.345
Corey Elevators? No.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.387
I hate that company.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.098
They've been attached to the project.
You signed off on them.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.517
Their elevators are too slow.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.186
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a slow elevator.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.896
[scoffs] Evan, are you crazy?

13:33.979 --> 13:37.483
If you change elevator companies now,
the costs would be astronomical.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.236
Abby, the cost of this whole project
is too high.

13:40.819 --> 13:45.449
Now you care about money? Because you're
always talking about how rich you are.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.744
I'm rich
because I'm careful with my money.

13:48.827 --> 13:49.662
Oh, really?

13:49.745 --> 13:52.748
Didn't I read that you flew in
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir

13:52.831 --> 13:54.208
to sing you "Happy Birthday"?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.252
It was worth every penny.

13:57.044 --> 14:03.050
Evan, why do I get the feeling that
this is not actually about slow elevators?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.885
Tell me what's bothering you.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.263
Me? Um...

14:07.346 --> 14:08.180
Not a thing.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.015
You say you like it
when I tell you the truth,

14:10.099 --> 14:11.392
so be truthful with me.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.728
-Cards on the table?
-Cards on the table.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.273
You know when I said
it didn't bother me when you kicked me?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.567
-Oh, boy.
-I guess it did bother me.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.277
-Okay.
-What bothers me most

14:21.360 --> 14:22.903
-is it was a sucker kick.
-What?

14:22.987 --> 14:23.946
I wasn't ready.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.490
You literally said, and I quote, "Ready."

14:26.574 --> 14:29.368
I know,
but when I think back on it, I wasn't.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.121
-And you should've known that.
-You tried to kick me first.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.958
That is not how I remember it.
You know what? Goodbye.

14:36.041 --> 14:36.917
Goodbye.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.215
One of us has to leave,
and this is my building.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.717
Yeah. Point taken.

Hello?

15:00.107 --> 15:00.983
Arthur?

15:01.483 --> 15:03.277
It's Nell O'Brien.

15:04.069 --> 15:09.116
I'm calling to wish you
a happy birthday and many more.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.409
[chuckles]

15:10.492 --> 15:13.495
No one's called
to wish me happy birthday in a long time.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.165
Well, as they say in the old country,

15:16.790 --> 15:21.253
may misfortune follow you all your life
and never catch up with you.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.380
[laughing] That's a good one, Nell.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.716
Go to your door.

15:25.799 --> 15:26.717
What?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.219
Go and open your front door.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.894
[upbeat music playing]

15:39.772 --> 15:41.273
Well, look at that.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.692
It's my homemade Irish bread

15:43.776 --> 15:46.278
and two cards
from my great-granddaughters.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.905
And a balloon.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.325
One is never too old for a balloon.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.577
Happy birthday, Arthur.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.744
[Mick] I understand, but it's essential
that we reach Mr. Kincaid.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.789
All right. Very good. Thank you so much.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.584
Dad, this is Peg Lucas,
the main archeologist from the site.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.670
-How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.380
Well, why don't you fill me in?

16:47.089 --> 16:51.051
It turns out these items first uncovered
were just the beginning.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.721
These wooden planks were dug out

16:53.804 --> 16:57.057
and analysis of the wood
dates it back to the 17th century.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.976
-[Mick] Wow.
-[Peg] Wow, indeed.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.855
But the really exciting news
is that just this morning,

17:02.938 --> 17:05.941
we recovered
what appears to be the bow of a ship.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.360
[Mick] Look at that.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.904
This could be a major historical find.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.198
A British supply ship from the 1600s.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.785
But you need to stop work
while we excavate it.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.789
What's Evan Kincaid
gonna think about this?

17:21.707 --> 17:22.958
It's hard to tell with him.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.421
But if he's looking for an excuse to
back out of the project, this could be it.

17:29.798 --> 17:33.010
I have to get back to the site.
There's a lot of work to do.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.970
-Thanks for coming.
-[Peg] Thanks.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.853
Well, I've left two messages.
They can't reach him.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.481
Hm. Oh.
Well, that's because he's in Iceland.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.233
-What's he doing in Iceland?
-Who knows?

17:48.317 --> 17:51.320
Maybe he's a super villain,
and that's where his secret lair is.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.200
Well, you've tried to reach him,
I've tried to reach him.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.910
What else can we do?

17:57.993 --> 18:01.413
I don't know,
but I do know we need this project.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.706
We can't let him back out.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.501
-Well, you've done everything you can.
-Yeah.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.297
I really wish
I hadn't kicked him in the head.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.140
I never thought I'd hear you say that.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.435
-Say what?
-That you have things under control.

18:24.061 --> 18:24.895
Well, I do.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.856
Abby's doing great at the office.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.025
Kevin and Sarah, they've got it together.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.028
Jess is getting married
and Bree's teaching.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.324
I actually feel I could go away
and everything would be all right.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.786
Are you trying to tell me something?

18:41.912 --> 18:43.372
-Are you sick?
-No.

18:44.373 --> 18:49.169
I just mean that after Jess' wedding,
I thought maybe we could...

18:50.462 --> 18:52.965
Maybe we could, uh,
go somewhere for a while.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.092
-Where?
-Anywhere.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.010
How much of a while?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.220
Any while.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.597
Are you talking retirement, Mick?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.516
No, I mean, just, you know,

19:03.183 --> 19:04.017
a vacation.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.604
Wow, when was the last time you did that?

19:07.688 --> 19:12.442
Hey, I've taken some vacations
in my 40-plus years in the business, okay?

19:12.526 --> 19:15.028
Hm. Okay. How many?

19:16.989 --> 19:17.823
Two.

Been trading with this guy.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.375
Carter!

19:30.502 --> 19:32.421
Oh, yeah, great to hear you too.

19:34.381 --> 19:38.260
How interested might you be
in an Arthur Driscoll retrospective?

19:38.343 --> 19:41.346
With at least a dozen
never-before-seen paintings?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.100
No, Carter, I'm not talking New York.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.312
The way to play it would be
to open here in Chesapeake Shores.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.229
His home base.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.691
Uh-huh.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.028
Okay. You bat it around a bit,

19:56.111 --> 19:59.740
but, full disclosure,
I do have other players.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.701
Great. Get back to me.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.914
Other players?

20:06.997 --> 20:08.498
Not that I've called yet.

-Megan O'Brien.
-I learned everything I know from you.

[tranquil music playing]

20:21.929 --> 20:23.222
-Hey!
-Hey.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.264
You're up early.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.059
Yeah, well,
the PTA can't carb-load itself.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.604
-It's nice that you help out.
-It is, isn't it? Yeah.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.981
-Need a hand?
-I sure could use the help.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.526
-These pastries are heavy.
-You're doing CrossFit there.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.238
Well, actually,
it's more like croissant-fit.

20:39.321 --> 20:43.784
[chuckles] Hey. Um, this is
kind of last-minute, but, uh...

20:45.244 --> 20:48.330
Jess and David's wedding is tomorrow.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.249
Would you wanna be my plus-one?

20:51.625 --> 20:52.501
Wow.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.795
Yeah, I'd be honored, for sure. Yeah.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.004
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.008
Okay. I will, um--
I'll text you the details.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.886
Great. Yeah, text me the deets.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.971
-All right.
-Sure.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.557
-I will do that.
-Great. I'm looking forward to it.

-Unique New York...
-Unique New York...

21:14.064 --> 21:16.024
-Mr. Driscoll.
-Which one of you is Caitlyn?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.111
-Me.
-You made me that beautiful birthday card.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.989
-Thank you so much, Caitlyn.
-You're welcome.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.573
Carrie. A word, please.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.619
-Do you know Claude Monet?
-Who?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.079
You've got something going on.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.251
That was a compliment.
I don't give them very often.

21:34.626 --> 21:35.961
Maybe I'm out of practice.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.173
-You decent with a brush?
-I guess. I usually use colored pencils.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.427
I like colored pencils too.
But, uh, use this.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.679
And these.

21:45.762 --> 21:46.930
Wow.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.641
-Are these all yours?
-No. They're yours now.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.936
I haven't painted or sketched for years.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.896
-Why not?
-I don't want to.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.232
Paint that.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.484
Or that.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.321
Heck, you can paint that.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.906
Paint whatever you want.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.410
The point is, paint it like you see it.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.247
You don't want to? Fine.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.957
No. It's just--

22:14.791 --> 22:16.376
I'm nervous. What if it's no good?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.462
What difference does that make?

22:18.545 --> 22:21.548
-The point is doing it.
-Okay.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.808
[tranquil music playing]

22:33.727 --> 22:35.479
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.902
So Crawford's Pet Shop, huh?

22:41.985 --> 22:45.113
Yeah. That's where he kept
that old parrot Tiki.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.115
The one you tried to teach dirty words to.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.077
-Yeah, but Mrs. Crawford always caught us.
-Yeah.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.996
So you don't think it's too expensive?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.664
Too big?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.793
I think you should go for it.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.378
Good. Because I already did.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.506
[both laugh]

23:02.589 --> 23:04.174
Here's what I think for the layout.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.301
Uh, let's see. Okay.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.720
So entrance is here.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.514
I'm taking these two pillars out.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.809
I wanna add a divider right here.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.938
I'm thinking about taking this wall out
and replacing it with glass, add depth.

23:19.064 --> 23:23.568
This is good, Connor. This is
a very smart use of the space, I think.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.694
Thanks, Dad.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.947
So, uh, how long
do you think it would take?

23:27.697 --> 23:29.825
Can you recommend anyone?

23:31.827 --> 23:35.080
I could pull four guys
and have it done in a few days.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.958
You hire another company,
this could go on forever.

23:42.420 --> 23:45.048
Connor, listen, I know
you wanna do this on your own,

23:45.132 --> 23:48.760
but part of growth is knowing
when to let people who love you help you.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.013
Ballpark, how much?

23:52.097 --> 23:54.516
More than you care to spend
and less than it's worth.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.436
If we have a deal,
I'll call my guys right now.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.315
All right. You got a deal.

24:04.526 --> 24:07.654
-[Bree] You asked Jay to be your plus-one?
-[Abby] I think so.

24:08.363 --> 24:09.197
Oh, you think?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.908
Well, I don't know. It was just a blur.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.827
Oh, I know that feeling.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.537
I got kissed the other day.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.373
By Jerry Trask.

24:18.456 --> 24:21.585
-Okay, I cannot keep up with you.
-I didn't expect it.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.837
Did you like it?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.506
I didn't not like it.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.842
-That's a ringing endorsement.
-I know.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.304
I met this other guy
that I might also be into.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.015
Now you sound like
the second act of one of your plays.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.641
-Really? Huh.
-Yeah.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.603
Well, the plot twist
is that I asked Jerry Trask

24:39.686 --> 24:41.646
to be my plus-one at the wedding.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.358
Okay. So wait,
was this before or after he kissed you?

24:45.859 --> 24:49.529
-Uh, before.
-Okay. Well, then maybe he thought that...

24:51.406 --> 24:53.074
Maybe he thought...

24:53.158 --> 24:56.369
-Yeah. Did you want him to think?
-I don't-- Didn't think so.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.079
Until I thought...

24:58.538 --> 24:59.539
Huh.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.125
He's not the jerk he was in high school.

25:04.044 --> 25:04.878
But...?

25:05.503 --> 25:09.174
[sighs] I don't know.
Do people ever really change?

to chicken out before the wedding.

-No way.
-To the wedding!

25:23.563 --> 25:25.398
[all] To the wedding!

25:25.482 --> 25:27.025
Wow, thank you, guys.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.321
Hey. When am I supposed to stop
seeing you before the wedding?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.948
Uh, midnight, I think.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.992
You guys are gonna be asleep
way before that.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.410
Oh, no. I'm not sleeping tonight.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.621
-Why not?
-She's been having nightmares.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.333
Last night,
David was carried off by a giant squid.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.293
"Release the kraken!"

25:45.377 --> 25:48.505
Nobody said that.
I don't wanna go through it again.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.050
So you assume that once you're married,
the bad dreams are going to stop?

25:52.133 --> 25:54.594
Sure. Won't they?

25:54.678 --> 25:56.680
-No. Definitely not.
-Definitely.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.181
Yeah, I think so.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.101
I'm gonna grab another round.

Hey, thanks again, man,
for helping me get this job.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.699
And I'm sorry.

26:15.782 --> 26:19.953
When you first came in at Kwik Go,
I was kind of, you know...

26:20.036 --> 26:22.205
Yeah, you were a little, you know...

26:22.289 --> 26:23.707
What are you guys celebrating?

26:23.790 --> 26:26.584
Oh, my little sister Jess,
she's getting married tomorrow.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.502
Oh.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.505
-You know, you should come.
-Oh, no.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.840
Yeah, no, it'll be fun.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.342
I'm sure but, you know--

26:34.843 --> 26:36.970
Hey, don't get all "you know" on me.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.223
Okay. I'll think about it.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.224

-Sure.

-A traditional Icelandic sweater.

-As a peace offering?
-As a gift.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.170
-You wanted to talk to me about something?
-Yes.

27:10.253 --> 27:13.923
Uh, there is an issue with the hotel site.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.842
[Evan] Ah, isn't there always?

27:15.925 --> 27:18.178
This one could cause a work stoppage.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.764
-Take a look.
-Uh, no. Just give me the gist of it.

27:21.264 --> 27:24.476
Okay. Uh, well, the gist is,

27:24.559 --> 27:27.812
those artifacts that they found
were just the beginning.

27:27.896 --> 27:33.943
Uh, Peggy thinks that she's found the bow
of a ship dating back to the 1600s.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.071
-A pirate ship?
-No.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.113
Oh!

27:37.197 --> 27:39.783
I wish it were a pirate ship.
That would've been so cool.

27:39.866 --> 27:42.452
Yes, it would have.
But it's more likely that it is a ship

27:42.535 --> 27:45.413
that brought over or supplied
the early European colonists.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.873
I guess that's cool too.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.001
Yeah. Cool in the sense
that it's a major historic discovery.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.463
And the Smithsonian would like us
to shut down the build

27:53.546 --> 27:55.882
until they can fully excavate it.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.634
How long would that take?

27:58.551 --> 27:59.969
Hard to say. Uh...

28:00.845 --> 28:03.264
-Six months. Maybe a year.
-Oh.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.477
Of course,
you could pull out of the project.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.603
I could.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.939
And, of course, we have contracts.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.774
-And I have lawyers.
-Yes.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.944
But I'm sure we could come
to an agreement. If it came to that.

28:16.027 --> 28:16.903
Yes.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.405
Okay. I'll think about it.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.782
Can I take this?
I wanna have my people go over it.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.123
Oh, what for?

36:07.206 --> 36:09.083
For the kiss the other night.

36:09.167 --> 36:13.212
I don't know what came over me.
Can we pretend that it didn't happen?

36:14.380 --> 36:15.590
What kiss?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.383
[laughs] Right.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.095
Okay, well, I will take that as a victory.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.515
Unfortunately,
I have to make my departure.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.019
-Oh, okay.
-But thank you so much for the invite.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.478
Of course, my pleasure.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.523
Okay. Well, have a good evening, captain.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.482
You too.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.860
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.073
Can you believe it?

36:41.157 --> 36:43.576
Your youngest granddaughter
is now married.

36:43.659 --> 36:49.540
You know, all those old clichés,
my, they're all true.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.794
It all goes by so fast.

36:53.878 --> 36:54.795
I agree.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
-Hi.
-Hey, Bree.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.973
You really married them good up there.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.100
-I did, didn't I?
-You did.

37:10.811 --> 37:11.938
Do you wanna dance?

37:13.189 --> 37:15.691
Oh, you know, it's not really my thing.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.196
That's fine. We can just sit.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.869
-You having fun?
-Oh, sure, yeah.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.540
I just haven't been
to a party like this in years.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.709
It's a little overwhelming.

37:34.585 --> 37:37.171
Okay. Why?
Where have they been keeping you?

37:38.005 --> 37:38.923
Nowhere.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.510
Do you wanna dance?

37:44.178 --> 37:45.638
-Sure.
-Yeah?

37:46.347 --> 37:48.015
-Let's go.
-Okay.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.524
You're not a bad dancer.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.277
Oh, yeah, I'm a regular Bruno Mars.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.736
-I think so.
-You do?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.365
You and I should keep practicing, though.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.326
[indistinct chatter]

38:14.208 --> 38:16.085
-Abby.
-Hi.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.881
This is the best wedding I have been to
since Harry and Meghan's.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.676
Okay, you went to the royal wedding,
we're all so impressed.

38:23.759 --> 38:27.888
Hm? No, I meant Harry and Meghan McCreer
from Long Island. Sweet couple.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.892
-I never know when you're messing with me.
-I don't really either.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.354
Would you like to dance?

38:35.438 --> 38:37.106
We don't have to dance.

38:37.189 --> 38:40.026
I know,
but it's a wedding and there's music.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.111
And let me guess,
you're a champion ballroom dancer.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.405
Far from it.
I was born with two left feet.

38:44.488 --> 38:49.035
-An odd medical condition, but I coped.
-I'll dance with you on one condition.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.037
-No more bad jokes.
-It's a deal.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.206
Whoa!

38:55.374 --> 38:57.501
-So you are a good dancer.
-I'm getting better.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.088
-Everyone has to have one weak spot.
-Oh, only one?

39:02.798 --> 39:06.886
I'm also not very good at martial arts.
You kicked me fair and square.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.763
I'm sorry I was so weird about it.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.558
I shouldn't have kicked you.

39:12.641 --> 39:13.642
[Evan] Mm...

39:13.726 --> 39:18.147
-I would have kicked me if I were you.
-That's nice of you to say, I guess.

39:20.816 --> 39:24.320
I've been thinking a lot
about the build and the ship.

39:24.403 --> 39:28.824
-That ship is really an amazing discovery.
-Yeah, I'm glad you think so.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.078
-Yeah. It's just too bad.
-What?

39:33.746 --> 39:36.791
I shouldn't talk about it now.
It's a beautiful wedding. Never mind.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.669
-No. No, you can't do that.
-Do what?

39:41.337 --> 39:43.798
You can't hint
that you're gonna pull out of the build

39:43.881 --> 39:45.925
and then talk about
what a beautiful wedding it is.

39:46.008 --> 39:49.220
-Well, it is a beautiful wedding.
-Are you pulling out of the build?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.223
I always do this.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.768
I break bad news
at the worst possible times.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.978
Maybe this is why I'm still single.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.814
So that's your final decision?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.234
I'm afraid it is.

40:03.859 --> 40:07.071
I'm sure we can come to a settlement
that will be fair for everyone.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.406
Mm-hm. Yeah.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.910
-Okay. I guess I should go.
-Mm-hm.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.830
Tell Jess and David I said goodbye.

40:19.041 --> 40:23.504
-What did Kincaid have to say?
-Just that it was a beautiful wedding.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.463
Yes, it was.

40:28.050 --> 40:28.884
Well...

40:30.010 --> 40:30.845
we did it.

40:31.887 --> 40:32.930
We did it.

40:33.722 --> 40:37.143
-How do you feel?
-I didn't think this was possible,

40:37.226 --> 40:39.687
but I feel more in love with you
than I ever have.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.149
-Thank you, husband.
-You're welcome, wife.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.733
[lively folk music playing]

40:44.817 --> 40:46.694
-Shall we dance again?
-[gasps] We shall.

40:47.862 --> 40:52.158
-What about your shoes?
-Oh. I can't. They're giving me blisters.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.367
Don't tell anybody.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.463
Abby.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.602
[narrator] Next on Chesapeake Shores:

44:06.685 --> 44:08.395
-Ow, my back! Mandrake.
-Who can I call?

44:08.479 --> 44:11.023
-You know a lot of famous people.
-They can't help me now.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.983
You're the new lieutenant, if you want it.

44:13.067 --> 44:16.070
-Might wait to have kids.
-[Jess] I kick David in my sleep.

44:16.153 --> 44:18.197
Can you imagine spending the night
with a kangaroo?

44:18.280 --> 44:20.532
Your dad and Kevin know this.
I've served time.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.868
-Have you told Bree?
-[Luke] I'll tell her this weekend.

44:22.951 --> 44:25.621
-[Evan] Could I have some lemonade?
-This is Evan Kincaid.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.623
Abby was nice enough to let me crash here.

44:27.706 --> 44:30.000
Hey, you okay? Sarah!
