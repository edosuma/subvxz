00:04.463 --> 00:05.803
[man] Calm down!

00:05.839 --> 00:07.799
[woman] Don’t you dare
tell me to calm down!

00:07.883 --> 00:09.383
[man] How much have
you had to drink today?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.296
[woman] Don’t you do that!

00:11.345 --> 00:12.435
-[glass breaking]

00:15.516 --> 00:17.306
[woman] Don’t you dare
walk away from me, Matthew.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.771
[Matthew] I will do as I damn
will please, this is my house!

00:19.811 --> 00:22.361
-[woman] I’ll kill you!
-[thumping]

00:23.524 --> 00:25.324
[dispatcher] 911,
what’s your emergency?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.859
Matthew?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.699
Matthew!

00:30.822 --> 00:32.412
Matthew!

00:32.448 --> 00:33.779
[dispatcher] Okay. We’ll send
someone over immediately.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.035

No. Oh, no.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.362
This is Nicole.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.736
Jack, how are you?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.119
A plea deal?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.290
You must be joking.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.789
Involuntary, time served.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.753
Great.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.382
Send the paperwork
over to my office

01:25.419 --> 01:27.499
and we’ll have it wrapped up
by the end of the day.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.756
[phone beeps]

01:28.797 --> 01:30.627
I’m getting another call,
I gotta run.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.384
Just send them over. Bye.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.216

-[sighs]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

01:40.142 --> 01:41.642
Matthew’s dead.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.655
Wait, what? When?

01:43.687 --> 01:44.807
Last night.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.525
[Nicole] Oh, my God, Riley.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.611
They’re saying...

01:50.777 --> 01:52.817
They’re saying
that it was murder.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.324
Matthew? Murdered?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.865
The cops have been here
all morning.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.252
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:00.287 --> 02:03.407
Look, I know how you feel
about coming home--

02:03.457 --> 02:05.077
If you knew, you wouldn’t ask.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.918
I need you, Nicki.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.173
I feel so alone.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.296
Look, even if I wanted
to come back, I can’t.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.302
I just finished up a big case.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.184
My desk is covered
with five months’ backlog.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.891
Who else am I supposed to call?

02:20.932 --> 02:23.101
What about Mom?

02:23.101 --> 02:25.021
How’s she doing with all this?

02:25.854 --> 02:28.274
She’s the one
that they arrested.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.652
[reporter]
The Beverly Hills resident

02:30.692 --> 02:32.242
was charged with murder

02:32.277 --> 02:34.357
after the vehicle she had been
driving struck and killed

02:34.404 --> 02:37.954
20-year-old USC student
John Clayton last year.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.491
Defense attorney Nicole Ray
held a press conference

02:40.535 --> 02:43.285
following yesterday’s verdict
of not guilty.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.460
What happened to John
was an unfortunate

02:45.499 --> 02:47.249
and horrible accident.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.342
But I stand here
today heartened by the fact

02:49.378 --> 02:53.168
that the jury decided
not to compound that tragedy

02:53.215 --> 02:54.595
-by depriving the community--
-Hello, ma’am.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.843
[Nicole] --of a wife and mother.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.465
Not to mention a philanthropist
who has done so much

02:59.513 --> 03:01.393
for the city of Beverly Hills.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.104
[man] May I help you
find your seat?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.772
[woman on PA] Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:05.811 --> 03:06.981
We’d like to welcome you onboard
flight number 100...

03:07.020 --> 03:08.770
Excuse me.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.154
Are you that lawyer, from TV?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.901
Yes. Actually, I am.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.203
I think it’s horrible
what you did.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.913
That woman should’ve gone
to prison

03:17.948 --> 03:20.488
for killing that nice young man.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.994
Shame.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.075
It was lovely to meet you.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.634
-[airplane engine humming]
-[dramatic music]

03:51.898 --> 03:55.858
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:00.031 --> 04:01.121
Nicki.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.158
Hi.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.330
Oh, God.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.788
-How are you?
-Hmm?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.198
I know it wasn’t easy
for you to come here.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.536
-You have no idea.
-But thank you.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.501
So what are we
looking at exactly?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.211
Well, it all started
when the neighbors called 911

04:14.254 --> 04:18.553
’cause they overheard, um,
Mom and Matthew arguing.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.262
Please don’t tell me
she’s drinking again.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.179
Dammit, Mom.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.771
The cops said they found her
standing over his body...

04:27.809 --> 04:29.139
at the bottom of the stairs.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.726
Let me guess.
She doesn’t remember.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.071
No.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.897
Look...

04:35.942 --> 04:37.902
I know she can be
a handful, but...

04:38.779 --> 04:41.109
you don’t think
that she could’ve...

04:41.156 --> 04:43.276
actually killed him, do you?

04:43.325 --> 04:44.955
Has she talked to anyone yet?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.793
Yeah, she’s been in there
with Charlene all morning.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.119
Charlene McManus?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.496
Deputy Charlene McManus.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.669
I told you.
She really needs your help.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.553
[breathes deeply]

05:00.467 --> 05:03.257
And if I asked you
for one good reason

05:03.303 --> 05:06.143
why I should risk
my reputation on that woman?

05:07.182 --> 05:09.182
Because you’re not doing it
for her.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.441
You’re doing it for me.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.018
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:14.022 --> 05:15.322
Please?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.897
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:19.694 --> 05:21.034
I’d better get in there

05:21.071 --> 05:23.951
before she buries herself
any deeper.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.415
My name is Nicole Ray.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.751
I’m here on behalf
of Katherine Rafferty.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.197
And you are?

05:30.247 --> 05:32.247
Her lawyer.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.540
[dramatic music]

05:35.585 --> 05:37.045
[door opens]

05:37.087 --> 05:37.997
[knocks on door]

05:38.046 --> 05:39.256
Yes?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.094
Her lawyer is here
to talk to her.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.553
Now?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.892
Your lawyer’s here.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.104
I didn’t order a lawyer.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.601
No.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.766
If you don’t mind,
I need a few moments

05:55.814 --> 05:57.324
to confer with my client.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.567
That won’t be necessary.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.438
And if you would,
a copy of her file.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.855
I’m confused.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.992
Are you her attorney or not?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.699
-She is not.
-I am.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.697
She’s all yours.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.253
[exhales deeply]

06:18.211 --> 06:19.591
What happened, Mom?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.345
I can’t help you
if you don’t tell me

06:23.383 --> 06:24.383
what’s going on.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.836
Didn’t ask for your help.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.676
[Nicole] They’re gonna
charge you with murder.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.892
You could be looking at life
with no parole,

06:30.932 --> 06:34.482
and that’s assuming the DA
doesn’t seek the death penalty.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.523
Are you even listening to me?

06:38.565 --> 06:39.775
Mom!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.615
What do you want me to say?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.574
That I’m so blessed
the famous Nicole Ray

06:47.616 --> 06:49.486
took time
out of her busy schedule

06:49.534 --> 06:51.044
to come down here and help dig

06:51.077 --> 06:53.407
one of the little people
out of trouble?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.542
Why are you here?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.924
I promised Riley.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.170
Ah. Your sister. Hmm.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.343
Silly me.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.255
Here I thought
I was the one in trouble.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.932
Did you kill him?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.057
You did not just ask me that.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.808
It’s a yes or no question, Mom.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.230
Look, I’m aware
of how you feel about me--

07:16.269 --> 07:17.649
[scoffs] That would be a first.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.147
--but to accuse me
of something like that?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.939
Yes or no!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.821
Go to hell.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.109
I don’t need this.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.652
[Kate] Makes two of us.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.824
Nice to see you, too.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.540
-[door slams close]
-[dramatic music]

07:38.249 --> 07:39.459
-[Riley] Nicki--
-No.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.751
I can’t force someone
to hire me.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.094
-You know she’s stubborn.
-I’m sorry.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.338
It was a mistake
to get your hopes up.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.760
Can you try again?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.128
You do know the definition
of insanity, right?

07:46.174 --> 07:47.634
Yes.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.546
For what it’s worth,
I’m sorry it didn’t work out.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.854
Okay. Well, do you have
to leave right away?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.138
Ri.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.184
Can you at least wait
until after Matthew’s wake?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.306
It’s gonna be small,
just a few people at the house.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.444
When?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.940
Tomorrow?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.071
-Ms. Ray?
-Yes?

08:04.109 --> 08:05.359
The Deputy asked me
to give you this.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.613
The paperwork you requested.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.403
Great. Thanks.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.702
Please?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.044
Fine. But just until
after the wake.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.577
Then I’m gone.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.620
How about I give you
a lift back to Mom’s house?

08:17.622 --> 08:18.872
I rented a car.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.785
Besides, I am not staying
at that house.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.504
She’s not even gonna be home.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.554
I’ll give you a call as soon
as I get settled, okay?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.758
Promise.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.183
Hmm. It is good
to see you again.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.121
Dammit, Mom.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.475

10:36.928 --> 10:37.928
For crying out...

10:37.971 --> 10:39.561
[rock music]

10:39.597 --> 10:42.767
Hey, some of us
are trying to think in here!

10:42.809 --> 10:44.439
[man] Go to hell, lady!

10:44.477 --> 10:46.437
Yeah, you, too.

[dramatic music]

11:27.604 --> 11:29.194
Hey. Hi, it’s Nicole.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.940
Yeah. Listen,
could you do me a favor?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.357
Could you tell me
what the temperature was

11:34.444 --> 11:36.244
in Eastborough
night before last?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.779
About 10:30.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.450
Really?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.201
No, I don’t miss
the humidity at all.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.754
Thank you.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.287
You, too.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.371
Bye.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.415

11:52.712 --> 11:55.172
[siren wails]

11:55.215 --> 11:56.475
-Thank you.
-Sure.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.377
[elevator bell dings]

11:58.426 --> 11:59.716
Nicki?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.052
What’s wrong?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.635
I’ve been going
over the police reports.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.810
-And?
-I don’t think

12:03.848 --> 12:04.848
they were alone.

12:04.891 --> 12:05.851
What do you mean?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.232
The night Matthew died.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.348
I think there was someone else
in the house.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.944
How do you know that?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.110
The windows in the photo.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.358
Look.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.530
-They’re closed.
-Exactly.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.449
But Mom never close the windows
in the living room

12:18.488 --> 12:19.528
because the house doesn’t have--

12:19.572 --> 12:20.992
Doesn’t have central air.
Exactly.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.702
So why were they closed
the night Matthew died?

12:25.203 --> 12:27.043
Someone else did it.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.540
Exactly.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.421
And whoever it is,
is setting Mom up for murder.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.551
[birds chirping]

12:37.173 --> 12:38.423
This is all problematic

12:38.466 --> 12:40.376
-right here for--
-[knocks on door]

12:41.302 --> 12:44.102
-Excuse me?
-You’re fired.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.468
Who do you think you are?

12:45.515 --> 12:46.725
Her attorney.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.016
Just ignore her, Chuck.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.729
-She’s with me.
-Don’t worry.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.149
I’m sure there’s plenty
of ambulances for you

12:51.187 --> 12:53.187
to chase down at County.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.441
Excuse me?

12:54.524 --> 12:55.942
She’s already been set up
for murder.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.492
She doesn’t need to be
sent up the river too.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.533
[sighs]

13:01.447 --> 13:04.027
Had enough of these
dead end cases anyway.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.410
Enjoy the loss.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.128
You made the headlines.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.088
Congratulations.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.418
There goes
your impartial jury pool.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.796
Why are you still here?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.432
Riley said you were leaving.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.547
Because as much
as it pains me to admit it...

13:25.596 --> 13:26.846
you need me.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.179
[scoffs] I needed you
10 years ago.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.475
Funny. I could say
the same thing about you.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.649
Oh. You’re just like
your father.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.479
He never knew
when to quit either.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.444
But he did know
not to close the windows.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.614
-What?
-In the summer.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.073
We always left the windows open.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.413
Oh, of course.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.028
The house doesn’t have
air conditioning.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.701
Exactly.

13:46.701 --> 13:50.251
So why were they closed
the night Matthew died?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.791
And since Matthew was lying
at the bottom of the stairs

13:53.833 --> 13:55.173
at the time,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.209
I’m guessing he didn’t
close them either.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.626
Are you saying
it wasn’t just a fall?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.343
I’m saying,
what if the police are right?

14:03.384 --> 14:06.304
What if someone did
push him down those stairs?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.756
It just wasn’t you.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.055
Who was it then?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.888
The same person
who closed those windows,

14:10.933 --> 14:12.523
probably when they used them
to leave,

14:12.560 --> 14:13.850
which would explain
why the doors

14:13.895 --> 14:16.065
had remained locked
from the inside.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.355
Wait. How do they know
who used my door?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.940
Unfortunately for you,
one of the few things

14:20.985 --> 14:22.235
Matthew did to update the house

14:22.278 --> 14:23.988
was installing smart locks,

14:24.030 --> 14:26.450
which means they know
any time someone came in

14:26.491 --> 14:27.621
and if anyone went out.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.988
Matthew did that for Riley.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.545
She kept forgetting her keys.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.119
I was stupid myself.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.004
Yeah, well,
it doesn’t help your case

14:35.083 --> 14:36.963
until you consider the window.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.053
I don’t remember there being
anyone else in the house.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.298
Your blood alcohol
content was .23,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.300
so I doubt you would’ve
remembered your name.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.432
I had one bad night. One.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.509
Be honest. You’ve had a lot
of bad nights over the years.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.175
Over the years, yes.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.774
But I had changed.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.270
Maybe if you had
stayed in touch,

14:55.311 --> 14:56.941
you would’ve known that.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.192
So what am I supposed to do?

15:04.612 --> 15:05.862
-Hire me.
-[sighs]

15:05.905 --> 15:07.525
Now, we can file a petition

15:07.573 --> 15:09.453
to see what fingerprints
they pulled off the windowsill.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.742
That’ll at least find
the last person who touched it.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.326
Can’t the public defender
get that information?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.662
Who, Chuck?

15:15.706 --> 15:18.576
It’s too much work. No.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.036
He’ll just make a plea deal
and move on

15:20.086 --> 15:21.416
to the next charity case
who needs a lawyer

15:21.421 --> 15:22.961
to do the bare minimum.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.506
Well, if it’s bad
as you say, maybe...

15:26.551 --> 15:28.471
maybe I should make a deal.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.804
Sure.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.098
If you feel like you’ve thrown
your life away enough already.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.483
Well, what would I be
looking at?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.479
-Life in prison.
-As opposed to?

15:38.563 --> 15:40.063
Death.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.438
And as tempting
as that sounds...

15:46.821 --> 15:48.821
I owe Riley her mother back.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.120
"Her" mother?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.291
Admit it.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.827
You need me, Mom.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.253
[dramatic music]

16:03.254 --> 16:04.424
I’d ask you how it’s going,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.384
but I know you two all too well.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.684
Look, I don’t know how,

16:07.717 --> 16:09.087
but I’m gonna scare up
another suspect

16:09.135 --> 16:10.805
for Matthew’s murder.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.515
I like your mother, Nicki,
I really do,

16:13.556 --> 16:15.136
but between the argument,

16:15.141 --> 16:18.391
the threat of violence,
and her claim not to remember.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.936
Lucky for her,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.729
unwinnable cases
happen to be my specialty.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.073
[sighs]

16:24.108 --> 16:25.688
You should know,
officially the Chief

16:25.735 --> 16:27.245
wants to close the case.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.448
And unofficially?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.609
[sighs]

16:30.656 --> 16:32.526
I’ll take a look if you do.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.373
I appreciate that.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.925
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I have a wake to attend.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.423
[dog barking]

16:47.465 --> 16:50.225
[indistinct chatter]

17:22.833 --> 17:25.292
I was starting to worry
you weren’t gonna make it.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.802
How’s Mom?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.514
As warm and welcoming as ever.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.516
I have no idea
how you ever lived with her.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.889
She changed.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.062
Matthew was a good influence.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.562
No one’s that much
of a miracle worker.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.896
[scoffs]

17:46.941 --> 17:49.781
Well, maybe if you visited
or, I don’t know,

17:49.819 --> 17:50.939
called every once in a while,

17:50.987 --> 17:52.277
you would be able to see that.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.113
It’s easy for you to say.

17:54.949 --> 17:58.659
She didn’t stumble in drunk
to your high school graduation.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.081
You didn’t almost miss
your college interview

18:01.163 --> 18:03.713
because she was out
busy getting a DUI.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.132
Okay.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.418
Fair enough.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.128
Let’s just focus on Matthew
for the afternoon.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.263
Deal?

18:13.092 --> 18:16.392
I’ll be honest,
I barely knew him.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.103
Well, let’s change that.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.385
Yeah.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.774
-Okay.
-I’ll introduce you.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.982
Come on.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.526
Sadie.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.489
This is Sadie.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.155
Sadie, Nicki.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.543
-Nicole.
-Oh,

18:42.580 --> 18:43.750
the other stepdaughter.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.499
-[scoff]
-Sadie works at the tavern.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.499
Uh-hmm.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.422
I’m sorry for your loss.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.508
He was a very kind man. And...

18:52.423 --> 18:54.343
he always spoke
so highly of you.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.178
-Really?
-[Sadie] Big time lawyer

18:57.178 --> 18:58.928
from the big city.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.889
Every time news
of one of your cases

19:01.932 --> 19:03.182
hit the internet...

19:04.185 --> 19:06.445
he must’ve shared it
with the whole town.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.941
That’s sweet.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.233
Uh-hmm.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.534
Well, it was so good
to finally meet you.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.858
It’s nice to have a face
with the name.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.246
I don’t know
any of these people.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.706
Okay. Um...

19:25.706 --> 19:27.206
that’s Pastor Atkins.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.419
He preaches at the church
that Matthew took Mom to.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.131
Hmm. Mom went to church?

19:33.214 --> 19:34.764
Sang on the choir.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.049
They both do.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.470
Well, did.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.138
Um...

19:41.222 --> 19:43.562
you remember the neighbors
from up the street.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.772
Um, that’s Frank.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.981
Frank and Matthew used to play
pickle ball together

19:49.063 --> 19:50.403
every Saturday morning.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.939
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.322
Matthew was actually
really good.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.821
He has a trophy upstairs.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.072
Hmm.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.583
Wyatt, Matthew’s brother.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.909
Wyatt.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.420
Hi, I’m Nicole.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.749
The golden stepdaughter.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.633
Yet now here you are,
defending his killer.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.593
We’ll just have to see
what the jury says.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.133
I don’t have to wait.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.636
I know she’s better off
where she is.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.430
Excuse me,
I’m gonna go get a drink.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.318
You must be Nicole.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.112
I am.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.203
Kirk Holloway.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.202
I was your dad’s, uh...

20:44.285 --> 20:46.705
I’m your stepdad’s
business partner.

20:47.830 --> 20:48.956
-Hi.
-Matthew said

20:48.956 --> 20:50.456
you’re quite the lawyer,

20:50.499 --> 20:53.539
even if your choice
of clients is...

20:53.627 --> 20:55.207
-questionable.
-Hmm.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.456
Frankly, Mr. Holloway,

20:56.464 --> 20:58.634
my choice of clients
is my business.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.221
I’ll respect that.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.006
Not a fan of your own whiskey?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.886
[chuckles] Yeah.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.385
I never actually had
a taste for it myself.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.058
Hmm.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.516
I was just looking for an excuse
to get a minute to myself.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.990
I know the feeling.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.863
It’s a bit awkward, huh?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.317
Being here, in this house again

21:24.366 --> 21:25.656
after...

21:27.244 --> 21:28.584
you know...

21:30.664 --> 21:32.254
for your mother
to do something like that--

21:32.333 --> 21:34.423
She hasn’t been convicted
of anything.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.422
Are they looking
at other suspects?

21:38.422 --> 21:41.342
Why? You got someone else
in mind?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.556
You know...

21:47.598 --> 21:49.678
Matthew used to tell me
about the fights

21:49.725 --> 21:51.555
that he and Kate were having.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.516
They were happening
more frequently,

21:53.521 --> 21:55.361
getting more volatile.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.532
He was becoming concerned.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.187
About my mother?

22:00.236 --> 22:01.776
About all of it...

22:02.613 --> 22:04.283
her temper, her drinking.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.044
I can’t stop thinking...

22:10.871 --> 22:13.211
maybe if I had
said something sooner.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.628
I’m gonna say hi to some people.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.884
-Uh-hmm.
-Sorry for your loss.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.772
I see you met Kirk.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.900
-Odd duck.
-Yeah.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.147
He seems pretty convinced
Mom’s guilty.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.981
Yeah. Well,

22:38.983 --> 22:41.735
she wasn’t really
fond of him, either.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.565
-Oh?
-[Riley] Everybody knew

22:43.571 --> 22:46.571
that the distillery
was Matthew’s baby.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.414
So what does that make Kirk?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.955
Overpaid math nerd.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.795
[chuckles]

22:52.830 --> 22:56.250
Anyways, anytime the distillery
actually showed a profit,

22:56.292 --> 23:00.002
the expenses had a convenient
way of suddenly growing.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.007
And you think the overpaid
math nerd is the culprit.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.932
I mean, hell,
if it was up to him,

23:06.969 --> 23:08.759
they would’ve
cashed out years ago.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.264
Hmm.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.140
Now, one of us
should make a speech

23:13.183 --> 23:14.603
before it gets too late.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.648
I told you, I barely knew him.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.189
Okay. Well, only one of us

23:21.275 --> 23:24.615
is a professional shyster, so...

23:24.653 --> 23:27.113
I’m assuming that was
supposed to be a compliment?

23:28.032 --> 23:29.116
Always.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.656
[chuckles]

23:32.620 --> 23:34.370
My sister and I would like
to thank you all

23:34.455 --> 23:36.215
for being with us here today.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.290
When your father dies of cancer

23:39.293 --> 23:41.843
while you’re young, it was easy

23:41.879 --> 23:45.129
to assume that no one could
ever follow in his footsteps.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.142
And then, mom met Matthew,

23:49.178 --> 23:52.218
kind, supportive, funny.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.892
The kind of positive influence

23:53.974 --> 23:55.984
that could make
a real difference

23:56.810 --> 23:58.310
and he was more than
just mom’s new husband.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.023
He was an important part

24:01.023 --> 24:02.193
of the community.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.069
An entrepreneur,
part of the church choir,

24:08.155 --> 24:11.735
and as I hear it, he had quite
the backhand at pickle ball.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.655
[chuckles]

24:13.661 --> 24:15.871
More importantly, however,

24:16.705 --> 24:18.245
he was a father figure.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.090
And I’m sure,
if he could see us now,

24:22.169 --> 24:23.499
he’d be smiling,

24:24.338 --> 24:26.168
feeling all the love,

24:26.215 --> 24:29.515
and appreciation in the room.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.677
And...

24:33.097 --> 24:34.677
I know my mother wishes

24:34.723 --> 24:38.103
she could be here
to thank you all in person, too.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.555
Anyone who knows
this family knows

24:39.687 --> 24:41.267
that my mother and I have had

24:41.355 --> 24:43.365
a challenging relationship.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.695
So, despite whatever issues
the two of us might have,

24:47.736 --> 24:50.736
as both her daughter
and attorney,

24:50.781 --> 24:53.911
I’d like us all to remember
she’s still a grieving widow,

24:54.785 --> 24:57.045
mourning the loss
of her husband.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.629
And so, on behalf
of the entire family,

25:01.709 --> 25:04.378
I’d like us all to raise
a glass of Matthew’s very own

25:04.378 --> 25:05.878

25:06.714 --> 25:08.224

25:09.049 --> 25:12.719
We love you and we miss you.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.050
May you rest in peace.

I’m gonna make a run for it?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.015
I wouldn’t recommend it.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.940

feel powerful.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.105
She’s just doing her job.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.515
What she should
be doing is looking

26:06.607 --> 26:07.977
for who
really killed my husband.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.613
This is just
a preliminary hearing.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.191
No one’s on trial yet.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.108
Hopefully,
it won’t even get that far.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.033
-"Hopefully?"
-Knowing these small towns,

26:15.115 --> 26:16.775
my guess is we’ll get
a prosecutor

26:16.825 --> 26:19.655
used to chasing taggers
and shoplifters.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.464
Is that...

26:25.793 --> 26:28.133
Bobby? You didn’t tell me
he still lived here.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.880
You never asked.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.967
So, District Attorney.
Impressive.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.797
Yeah. What can I say? Some of us
opted for the small pond.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.055
Which is why I’m surprised you
actually took your mom’s case.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.969
Everyone’s entitled
to a decent defense.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.143
That they are.
And from what I hear,

26:43.143 --> 26:45.233
you charge quite a pretty
penny for it, too.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.152
Well, if you’re interested,
I can always put in a good word

26:47.189 --> 26:48.569
-for you at the firm.
-Well, unfortunately,

26:48.649 --> 26:50.029
I’d like to see criminals

26:50.067 --> 26:51.817
pay for their crimes
and not their attorneys.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.320
And I prefer to see justice
reserved for the guilty,

26:54.321 --> 26:55.531
not the innocent.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.535
Same old Nicki.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.584

Good morning, Your Honor.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.016
No, stand up.

27:23.016 --> 27:26.686
We have gathered here
for the arraignment

27:26.687 --> 27:28.687
of Katherine Rafferty.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.859
Ms. Rafferty,

27:30.899 --> 27:33.026
in pursuant to penal code 19.01,

27:33.026 --> 27:35.696
you’ve been charged
with a class A felony.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.526
Murder in the first degree

27:37.573 --> 27:39.533
in the death
of Matthew Rafferty.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.415
Counselor, has your client
read the criminal complaint?

27:42.452 --> 27:44.542
-They have, Your Honor.
-And are they aware

27:44.580 --> 27:45.870
of the mandatory
sentencing requirements

27:45.873 --> 27:47.463
should they be found guilty,

27:47.541 --> 27:48.961
which is no less
than life in prison

27:49.042 --> 27:51.252
without
the possibility of parole?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.462
They are.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.802
Very well.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.921
Ms. Rafferty,

27:55.966 --> 27:57.046
in the charge
of first degree murder,

27:57.050 --> 27:58.590
how do you plead?

27:58.635 --> 27:59.715
Not guilty.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.051
[crowd groaning]

28:01.054 --> 28:03.056
-[man] What?
-[woman] Really?

28:03.056 --> 28:04.926
-[gavel bangs]
-Order.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.398
A little louder, if you please.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.558
Not guilty.

28:12.566 --> 28:13.816
Very well.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.072
The trial is set for...

28:18.739 --> 28:20.159
9:00 AM,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.910
Monday the 25th,
three weeks from today.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.245
Your Honor, the defense
moves to request bail

28:25.245 --> 28:27.325
for the defendant
until the trial.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.583
The People object, Your Honor.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.633
Your motion is denied, Ms. Ray.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.458
Then the defense moves to
request that the defendant

28:33.462 --> 28:36.262
be placed under house
arrest until the trial.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.128
Also denied, Ms. Ray.

28:40.844 --> 28:45.474
Now, if there are no further
matters to be discussed,

28:46.600 --> 28:48.850

is hereby adjourned.

You know me better than to ask
something like that.

I just wondered if she happened
to mention the distillery.

Six weeks ago, Matthew Rafferty

31:00.734 --> 31:02.574
cutting his partner
out completely.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.991

31:04.071 --> 31:05.821
That leaves everything
to your mother.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.816
Including the distillery.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.738
So, she gets a new business
and he files for unemployment.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.794
It’s a small town
craft distillery.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.579
By the time you deduct expenses,

31:14.623 --> 31:16.673
Kirk’s unemployment check
is probably worth more.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.419
You’re right.
The distillery was losing money.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.589
But the land that the distillery
was sitting on?

31:21.630 --> 31:24.420
-That’s a different story.
-Oh?

31:25.675 --> 31:27.425
And the rumor is,
Matthew was in the process

31:27.469 --> 31:29.849
of selling it to a developer
when he passed.

31:30.764 --> 31:34.434

34:40.996 --> 34:43.616
They weren’t a match
for anyone in the system.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.715
And the autopsy showed

34:46.793 --> 34:49.053
that the fall
was not accidental.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.219
Oh. Great.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.129
Mom, I have to ask.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.975
Did you push Matthew
down those stairs?

34:57.012 --> 34:59.306
-Of course not!
-Did you do anything

34:59.306 --> 35:01.136
that might’ve
inadvertently caused him

35:01.141 --> 35:02.811
-to fall down the stairs?
-No!

35:02.851 --> 35:05.061
Would you even
remember it if you had?

35:09.399 --> 35:11.729
You think I’ve forgotten
what it was like?

35:13.528 --> 35:14.858
When you start drinking at lunch

35:14.863 --> 35:17.163
and forget to pick me up
from school?

35:17.198 --> 35:19.698
When you’d be out all night long
and then you’d come home

35:19.743 --> 35:21.333
and forget
how you even got there?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.909
Because I sure as hell have not!

35:22.996 --> 35:24.656
So do you actually
think I’m capable

35:24.664 --> 35:26.084
of something like that?
You’re my daughter!

35:26.166 --> 35:28.416
No, I am your lawyer!

35:38.178 --> 35:39.508
Fine.

35:40.680 --> 35:44.730
If you don’t believe me,
maybe the court will.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.018
What are you talking about?

35:46.019 --> 35:47.687
When I take the stand,

35:47.687 --> 35:49.687
I will just tell them
I passed out on the couch,

35:49.689 --> 35:52.019
I don’t know what happened
to your stepfather.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.903
You don’t seriously think
I’m gonna let you testify.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.197
I have every right
to clear my name.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.027
You get up on that stand,

35:59.074 --> 36:02.454
it’s like handing
Bobby O’Donnell a loaded gun!

36:02.535 --> 36:03.695
I’ve got nothing to hide.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.415
They will find something.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.625
And when they do,
they will crucify you!

36:08.708 --> 36:11.378
-How do you know?
-Because that’s what I would do.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.259
[dramatic music]

36:20.053 --> 36:21.393
[Riley] If it was up to him,
they would’ve cashed out

36:21.429 --> 36:22.719
-years ago.
-[Nicole] No,

36:22.806 --> 36:25.386
but you might for $1.5 million.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.233
[Kate] What about
those fingerprints?

36:27.268 --> 36:28.938
[Nicole] They weren’t a match
for anyone in the system.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.728
Did you push Matthew
down the stairs?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.230
[Kate] Of course not!

36:32.232 --> 36:33.900
[Nicole] Did you do anything
that might have,

36:33.900 --> 36:36.069
inadvertently, cause him
to fall down the stairs?

36:36.069 --> 36:37.489
[Kate] No.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.740
[dramatic music]

36:48.748 --> 36:50.748
[water gushing]

36:51.918 --> 36:54.248
Could you tell Bobby,
Nicole Ray is here to see him?

36:54.295 --> 36:56.125
Sure. Have a seat.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.505
[Bobby] You just couldn’t
stay away, could you?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.467
Maybe I was just curious to see

37:06.516 --> 37:07.926
what Eastborough’s
District Attorney’s office

37:07.976 --> 37:09.516
actually looked like.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.938
Hmm, cushy,

37:11.938 --> 37:13.608
although, the view
is probably not as nice

37:13.648 --> 37:15.108
as the one from your high-rise.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.320
Who said my office
was in a high-rise?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.650
It’s not?

37:18.695 --> 37:19.825
No, it is.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.323
I was just curious.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.948
Well, you really
wanna be impress?

37:22.991 --> 37:25.281
Come on back.
I’ll give you the tour.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.043
This is where the magic happens.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.054
Wow.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.301
So why are you really here?

37:43.344 --> 37:46.354
You’re not gonna offer me
a cup of Sanka first?

37:48.057 --> 37:50.477
Let me guess, you asked
her about the inheritance

37:50.477 --> 37:52.977
and now you realized
you took on a losing case.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.019
I asked about the inheritance.

37:55.064 --> 37:58.484
And now, I’m about to poke
some serious holes in your case.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.986
[chuckles] Good luck with that.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.239
I need the witness statements.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.413
The reports
were in the discovery.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.912
-I want the actual transcripts.
-Why?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.504
You already know
they’re harmful to your case.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.577
That’s not up to you
to decide, is it?

38:15.084 --> 38:17.094
[sigh] Didn’t your mother

38:17.170 --> 38:19.090
ever tell you
not to ask questions

38:19.172 --> 38:21.012
you don’t wanna hear
the answers to?

38:21.049 --> 38:23.009
Hmm, must have slipped her mind.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.925
Helen and Herald Mullins.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.427
There.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.267
That wasn’t so hard, was it?

38:33.353 --> 38:35.021
You should know
that I’ve secured convictions

38:35.021 --> 38:36.856
on less than the piece
of paper in your hand.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.025
Then I’m sure you won’t mind
if I reach out and verify

38:39.025 --> 38:40.685
the information in here.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.031
Wait. Did you just accuse me
of doctoring their testimony?

38:44.072 --> 38:47.702
Please,
don’t be so sanctimonious.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.452
You wouldn’t be the first
district attorney

38:49.536 --> 38:51.036
to bend the rules to win a case.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.247
And you wouldn’t be
the first defense attorney

38:53.289 --> 38:55.619
to shield their client
with a smoke screen of red tape.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.546
I guess we’ll just have
to find out, won’t I?

38:59.546 --> 39:02.586
Fine. You wanna talk
to them, be my guest.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.551
Although, I should warn you,

39:04.551 --> 39:06.971
Helen wasn’t necessarily
the biggest fan of your mother.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.473
Sounds an awful lot
like biased to me.

39:09.556 --> 39:10.926
You don’t need me to remind you

39:10.974 --> 39:12.644
how difficult
your mother was to love.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.941
No. That’s right, I don’t.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.770
Hmm, did I strike a nerve?

39:20.441 --> 39:22.071
Thanks for the file.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.400
Anytime.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.741
-Did you forget something?
-Isn’t this the moment

39:27.782 --> 39:28.992
when you wish me luck
and tell me

39:29.075 --> 39:30.735
how much I’m gonna need it?

39:31.578 --> 39:33.248
Would it change your mind?

39:33.288 --> 39:34.458
Not an inch.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.417
Then I won’t waste my breath.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.678
[doorbell rings]

39:46.718 --> 39:49.048
-[Helen] Who is it?
-Helen Mullins?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.755
My name is Nicole Ray.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.467
I’m representing...hi.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.965
I know who you are.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.227
[Harold] Hon, who is it?

39:55.268 --> 39:56.308
Kate’s daughter.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.942
You can call me Nicole.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.862
Wanna come in?
I just made some coffee.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.689
I only need
a moment of your time.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.784
We’ve already told everything
we know to the police.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.109
Yes, I’ve read the transcripts
of your conversation.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.285
Then why are you here?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.485
Have you seen this man?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.998
You two happened to be
the only witnesses we have.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.673
Unfortunately,
we’re not too keen

40:21.711 --> 40:23.461
on sticking our noses
where they don’t belong.

40:23.504 --> 40:24.714
Is that why you called
the police the other night?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.046
Because you didn’t wanna stick

40:26.090 --> 40:27.430
your nose
where it doesn’t belong?

40:27.467 --> 40:29.467
I called the police
because I was concerned

40:29.510 --> 40:30.760
for Matthew.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.513
Not that it did much good.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.965
They were fighting.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.395
[Helen]
They were always fighting.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.774
Can you just take another look?

40:38.811 --> 40:40.481
Please.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.271
Have you seen
him around the house?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.235
[Helen] Kirk? Sure.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.315
He and Matthew worked together.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.531
-What about the night he died?
-No.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.781
It was just Matthew
and your mother.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.623
You mean it was just
the two of them

40:52.659 --> 40:53.949
that you could hear?

40:59.624 --> 41:01.294
Thank you for your time.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.247
You know,
now that you mention it,

41:05.296 --> 41:06.796
there is one thing.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.089
I do remember hearing
her shout that night.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.553
And what was that?

41:10.593 --> 41:13.053
She said,
"I’m going to kill you."

41:14.555 --> 41:15.965
[sigh]

41:17.100 --> 41:20.230
[dramatic music]

41:27.527 --> 41:28.937
Ms. Ray?

41:28.987 --> 41:30.107
Harold?

41:30.154 --> 41:32.494
Please, forgive my wife.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.072
She means well,

41:34.117 --> 41:37.537
but sometimes she can be
as stubborn as an ox.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.658
[laughs] I know the type.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.174
Now, you didn’t hear
this from me,

41:43.501 --> 41:45.381
a couple of months back,

41:45.420 --> 41:47.210
I was mowing the lawn,

41:47.255 --> 41:49.135
your mother was at work.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.803
Let’s just say that,
um, Matthew wasn’t alone.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.675
Another woman?

41:55.972 --> 41:58.062
Was Matthew having an affair?

41:58.099 --> 41:59.729
I-I didn’t ask.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.557
You’re the first
and the only person

42:01.602 --> 42:04.272
that I mentioned this to.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.273
I don’t suppose you have a name?

42:07.900 --> 42:09.070
[sighs]

42:10.319 --> 42:12.859
Could you at least
tell me what she looked like?

42:12.905 --> 42:15.525
A little younger than your mom,

42:15.575 --> 42:17.125
blonde hair.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.406
If my mother had found out,

42:19.454 --> 42:20.624
that certainly
would’ve given them

42:20.663 --> 42:22.123
something to fight about.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.036
Yes, it would.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.583
Yes, it would.

42:25.585 --> 42:26.965
Good luck.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.423
[camera shutter clicks]

42:28.463 --> 42:29.633
Thank you.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.054
[camera shutter clicks]

42:38.723 --> 42:39.893
Are you crazy?

42:39.932 --> 42:41.642
You threatened to kill him?

42:41.726 --> 42:43.596
I was angry! I didn’t mean it!

42:43.686 --> 42:45.226
You didn’t mean it
when you said it

42:45.271 --> 42:46.691
or when you actually did it?

42:46.731 --> 42:48.481
I don’t even remember saying it.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.146
Unfortunately for you,
your neighbor does.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.653
And I’m sure
she’ll be more than happy

42:51.694 --> 42:53.904
to share it with the jury.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.205
Yeah, that sounds like Helen.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.489
Along with Matthew’s affair.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.576
They know about that?

42:59.619 --> 43:01.289
So you did know?

43:01.329 --> 43:02.789
Yeah.

43:02.830 --> 43:05.620
You seriously didn’t think
I would find out?

43:05.625 --> 43:07.885
I’m sorry. I-I just
didn’t see the point

43:07.919 --> 43:09.129
in ruining his reputation.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.630
The prosecution will.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.972
Okay. Fine! Fine!

43:14.008 --> 43:16.008
Matthew’s been cheating
on me for months.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.342
Okay? Are you happy?

43:20.973 --> 43:25.313
A while back, I happened to find
some emails on his computer.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.729
"Happened?"

43:29.023 --> 43:31.033
He’s been spending
a lot of late nights at work

43:31.067 --> 43:33.317
and texting on his phone
all the time.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.201
I was suspicious.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.778
Go on.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.405
The letters were romantic.

43:41.327 --> 43:42.487
I confronted him about it.

43:42.537 --> 43:43.787
He swore he’d stop.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.370
But he didn’t, did he?

43:47.250 --> 43:48.580
The night Matthew...

43:50.211 --> 43:53.341
I had found more letters
on the computer.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.381
That’s why you two
were fighting?

43:55.424 --> 43:58.054
But that time he did end it.

43:58.094 --> 44:00.144
I watched him. He sent the texts

44:00.179 --> 44:02.219
-right in front of me.
-[Nicole] And?

44:02.265 --> 44:04.185
He said she didn’t take it well.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.444
Do you know who it was?

44:06.477 --> 44:07.687
No.

44:07.728 --> 44:08.898
Frankly, I didn’t wanna know.

44:08.938 --> 44:10.648
I-I-I just wanted it to be over.

44:10.690 --> 44:12.110
End of story.

44:12.150 --> 44:16.070
Why is it that every time
I pursue a lead

44:16.112 --> 44:20.072
to clear your name, all I do
is uncover another motive?

44:21.576 --> 44:23.786
And when did you start
drinking again?

44:23.828 --> 44:27.208
My husband of 15 years
was having an affair on me.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.288
Excuse me if I wanted a drink.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.833
"A drink"?

44:33.504 --> 44:34.804
A few.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.550
[sighs]

44:37.592 --> 44:39.472
Yeah, I-I lost count.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.894
Okay.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.311
All right.

44:48.895 --> 44:50.405
Let’s just go back
to that night.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.068
You confronted him
about the affair?

44:53.107 --> 44:55.777
Yeah. We were arguing.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.358
It would seem like hours.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.279
And then I sat
on the couch...no,

45:01.365 --> 45:04.025
I laid on the couch.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.580
I don’t remember what happened
after that.

45:07.622 --> 45:09.872
Please, try.

45:09.916 --> 45:12.576
My head was spinning,

45:12.627 --> 45:14.747
like he said he was going
upstairs to go to bed.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.415
And this whole time,
you two were alone?

45:17.465 --> 45:19.055
I think so.

45:19.091 --> 45:20.931
Think. At any point,

45:20.968 --> 45:23.468
was there anyone else
in the house?

45:23.512 --> 45:25.812
[dramatic music]

45:31.145 --> 45:32.855
Maybe.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.477
-"Maybe"?
-I-I don’t know!

45:34.523 --> 45:37.573
-Like who?
-Kirk, maybe?

45:37.610 --> 45:39.320
-Kirk?
-Losing half the profits

45:39.362 --> 45:40.902
from that real estate sale
would be enough

45:40.905 --> 45:43.415
to make anyone jealous,
don’t you think?

45:43.449 --> 45:44.909
Yeah.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.002
Tell you what.

45:48.037 --> 45:49.117
You think about it.

45:49.163 --> 45:50.623
Where are you going?

45:50.665 --> 45:51.875
I’m gonna go back
to the house to see

45:51.916 --> 45:54.036
if the police missed anything.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.086
Nicole?

46:00.132 --> 46:01.592
On a scale from one to ten,

46:01.634 --> 46:03.934
how screwed do you think I am?

46:03.970 --> 46:04.930
Twelve.

46:04.971 --> 46:06.221
[alarm buzzes]

46:07.014 --> 46:10.184
[door creaking]

46:19.735 --> 46:20.985
[Nicole] Ri...

46:22.822 --> 46:24.452
you here?

46:29.161 --> 46:32.371
[dramatic music]

47:24.008 --> 47:28.258
"I’d be glad, just to be sad,
thinking of you."

47:29.430 --> 47:30.810
[Matthew] How much
have you had to drink?

47:30.848 --> 47:32.558
[Kate] Oh, here we go again,

47:32.600 --> 47:33.930
it’s the same thing.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.056
I don’t wanna do this
right now!

47:35.102 --> 47:36.402
I never wanna do this!

48:01.212 --> 48:02.552
That’s how you got in.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.758
[dramatic music]

48:37.248 --> 48:38.998
[Matthew groans]

48:39.041 --> 48:40.671
[body thuds]

48:46.549 --> 48:47.839
Hmm.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.652
[metal clinks]

49:03.816 --> 49:05.356
Ri?

49:13.784 --> 49:15.744
Ri, is that you?

49:53.282 --> 49:54.622
[wood creaks]

49:55.701 --> 49:59.291
[suspenseful music]

50:16.555 --> 50:19.425
[cell phone ringing]

50:22.228 --> 50:23.348
Hello?

50:23.395 --> 50:25.395
[Riley] Hey, Nicki, it’s me.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.647
Riley.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.362
Yeah, I’m over at the house.
Where are you?

50:30.402 --> 50:31.902
[Riley] I’m getting ready
to head to work.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.276
What time are you leaving?

50:33.322 --> 50:35.622
[Riley] Shouldn’t be
too much longer.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.618
What the hell.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.873
[Riley] Nicki?

50:40.913 --> 50:42.663
Nicki, what happened?

50:42.706 --> 50:44.616
Can I call you back later?

50:44.625 --> 50:46.544
-[Riley] Sure.
-Okay. Bye.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.714
[dramatic music]

51:13.070 --> 51:14.490
[Riley] Nicole?

51:14.530 --> 51:16.200
I’m glad I caught you,
you got a sec?

51:17.575 --> 51:19.535
Is it about mom’s case?

51:19.577 --> 51:21.997
Did you know Matthew
was having an affair?

51:23.122 --> 51:25.082
Wait, what?

51:25.124 --> 51:26.834
Apparently it had been
happening for a while.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.875
You really didn’t know?

51:28.919 --> 51:30.169
No.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.055
Absolutely not.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.262
-Did mom know?
-Yeah.

51:37.636 --> 51:39.176
Another motive?

51:39.221 --> 51:41.521
Apparently they grow
on trees around here.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.102
What happened?

51:46.145 --> 51:47.855
Did he--did he tell her?

51:47.896 --> 51:50.106
She found some emails
on his computer.

51:50.149 --> 51:52.189
I was just over at her house.
I found one of them myself.

51:52.234 --> 51:53.824
Do I even wanna know
what it said?

51:53.861 --> 51:56.821
The usual thinking of you,
stuff like that.

51:58.490 --> 51:59.910
You think she did it?

51:59.950 --> 52:03.200
I was thinking Kirk
but now, who knows?

52:03.287 --> 52:05.327
Look, I know
she’s not the best person

52:05.372 --> 52:08.582
but I truly don’t think
that she’s capable

52:08.626 --> 52:09.956
of doing such a thing.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.802
You mean you don’t think
she’d be capable

52:11.837 --> 52:14.257
of doing such a thing
when she’s sober?

52:14.298 --> 52:15.838
In either state, Nicki.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.303
Twelve hours ago,
I would have agreed with you.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.974
Now, who knows?

52:21.889 --> 52:23.679
I guess I was just hoping
that maybe you

52:23.724 --> 52:26.274
had heard something or maybe
you knew who the woman was.

52:26.310 --> 52:27.600
No.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.813
I’m sorry.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.531
Look, my shift
is about to start.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.149
Can we talk about this
more tomorrow morning?

52:37.196 --> 52:38.906
Burning the midnight
oil, huh?

52:38.906 --> 52:40.406
[scoffs]

52:40.449 --> 52:42.909
Welcome to the glamorous world
of medicine.

52:42.951 --> 52:45.621
I’ll be at the motel,
if you think of anything.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.424
Sounds good.

52:52.044 --> 52:53.504
[Nicole] Bye.

53:01.053 --> 53:04.223
[dramatic music]

53:15.776 --> 53:16.986
[Nicole] Hey.

53:24.243 --> 53:25.873
[engine revs]

53:25.911 --> 53:27.581
[tires screeching]

53:27.621 --> 53:30.751
[dramatic music]

53:59.319 --> 54:00.609
[sighs]

54:02.990 --> 54:04.820
[McManus] We spoke
to the manager.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.165
Said the housekeeper reported

54:06.201 --> 54:07.741
her keys stolen
a couple days ago.

54:07.786 --> 54:09.286
This just proves it.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.579
Someone is trying to stop
my investigation.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.460
Anyone giving you
any trouble lately?

54:14.501 --> 54:17.461
Matthew’s brother
isn’t exactly a fan.

54:17.504 --> 54:18.964
Wyatt.

54:19.047 --> 54:20.627
I’ll tell you what.
I’ll give him a call

54:20.674 --> 54:22.184
and find out
where he was tonight.

54:22.217 --> 54:23.547
And maybe Kirk Holloway.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.300
For your mother’s sake,
I hope you’re as good

54:26.346 --> 54:28.676
at being a lawyer
as you are making enemies.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.314
I don’t suppose this place
has a security camera.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.231
Sorry.

54:33.270 --> 54:34.850
You know, I’d feel better
if you weren’t alone.

54:34.897 --> 54:36.817
Is there anyone you can call,
maybe Riley?

54:36.857 --> 54:39.227
No. She’s still at work.
But I’ll be fine.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.236
Really.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.608
In the meantime,
I’m gonna run prints on this.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.025
Maybe we’ll get lucky.

54:45.073 --> 54:47.163
Can you compare them to this?

54:48.243 --> 54:51.083
Do I even wanna know
where you got this from?

54:51.121 --> 54:54.081
You said you’d take
a look if I do.

54:55.501 --> 54:57.591
-Do you ever rest?
-I will

54:57.628 --> 55:00.298
when my mother
gets out of jail.

55:00.339 --> 55:03.379
If I ever get in trouble,
I know who I’m gonna call.

55:03.425 --> 55:04.965
Thank you, Charlene.

55:05.719 --> 55:06.969
[door opens]

55:08.055 --> 55:10.275
[sighs]

55:11.600 --> 55:14.270
[birds chirping]

55:14.311 --> 55:17.521
[cell phone ringing]

55:26.990 --> 55:28.030
This is Nicole.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.245
[McManus] It’s Charlene.

55:29.284 --> 55:30.544
Got some news?

55:30.577 --> 55:32.947
Actually I do.
We looked into Wyatt.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.706
And?

55:34.748 --> 55:36.038
Thought it might interest you
to hear

55:36.083 --> 55:37.463
that Mr. Rafferty was a no-show

55:37.501 --> 55:39.041
for work last night.

55:39.127 --> 55:40.957
What about the prints
from the bottle?

55:41.004 --> 55:42.134
No match.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.382
Not the photo or the window

55:43.423 --> 55:44.466
at your mother’s house.

55:44.466 --> 55:47.136
[clicks tongue] Dammit.

55:51.932 --> 55:55.312
Hey, you want
some unsolicited advice?

55:55.352 --> 55:57.192
It’s my favorite kind.

55:57.229 --> 55:59.609
[McManus] In my experience,
I’ve learned that these things

55:59.648 --> 56:02.478
usually come down
to one of two things.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.488
Passion or money.

56:12.035 --> 56:13.825
[clicks tongue]

56:13.871 --> 56:17.041
[dramatic music]

56:40.564 --> 56:42.274
John Harding?

56:42.316 --> 56:45.436
You don’t know me, but my name
is Nicole, Nicole Ray.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.778
Oh. Yes.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.782
Sorry about your stepfather.

56:50.824 --> 56:52.624
If you have a moment,
I would just love to ask you

56:52.659 --> 56:53.869
a few questions about his will.

56:53.911 --> 56:54.911
Actually I’m running late

56:54.953 --> 56:56.753
for a client meeting.

56:56.788 --> 57:00.208
Besides, it’s a little soon
to probate, don’t you think?

57:00.250 --> 57:01.790
Oh, no, no, no.
I’m not interested

57:01.835 --> 57:03.375
in contesting it.
I’m representing my mother

57:03.420 --> 57:05.340
-in the murder trial.
-Well, that’s out

57:05.380 --> 57:07.090
of my area of expertise.

57:07.132 --> 57:08.592
Well, I was just wondering
if something were to happen

57:08.634 --> 57:11.684
to my mother,
what happens to the will?

57:11.720 --> 57:13.390
Let me guess.

57:13.430 --> 57:17.100
You went to one of those
big fancy law schools, huh?

57:17.142 --> 57:18.442
UV.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.147
And did they teach you about

57:20.187 --> 57:22.647
attorney-client privilege there?

57:22.689 --> 57:23.939
They did.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.282
As a legal matter, yes.

57:25.317 --> 57:26.727
But as a family member,

57:26.777 --> 57:28.897
inquiring about family business,

57:28.946 --> 57:30.606
I believe it falls under
the category

57:30.656 --> 57:32.776
of nosy stepdaughter?

57:32.824 --> 57:36.084
[chuckling]

57:37.537 --> 57:41.827
I suppose it wouldn’t hurt
if I’m a few minutes late,

57:41.875 --> 57:44.335
nosy stepdaughter.

57:45.879 --> 57:48.799
I have a very particular
filing system,

57:48.840 --> 57:51.090
let’s see, Rafferty.

57:51.134 --> 57:52.684
Rafferty, ah...

57:53.679 --> 57:56.059
Matthew Rafferty.

57:56.098 --> 58:00.098
Hmm, six weeks ago,
Matthew redrafted his will

58:00.143 --> 58:02.353
and made your mother
as his primary beneficiary.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.106
Because he didn’t trust
his partner.

58:04.147 --> 58:05.687
Correct.

58:05.732 --> 58:06.902
Now, let’s say my mother

58:06.942 --> 58:08.152
gets convicted
for Matthew’s murder.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.823
[Harding]
It’s the slayer statute.

58:09.861 --> 58:12.201
That would prevent her
from inheriting one penny

58:12.239 --> 58:14.819
-of Matthew’s estate.
-In which case.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.535
Goes to the next beneficiary.

58:16.576 --> 58:18.826
So, theoretically, someone
could have killed Matthew

58:18.870 --> 58:20.910
and framed my mother
so that they would collect

58:20.956 --> 58:22.786
the inheritance instead?

58:22.833 --> 58:24.463
[chuckling]

58:24.501 --> 58:26.791
That’s some four-dimensional
chess right there.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.547
[Nicole] Guess I’m looking
for Eastborough’s

58:28.588 --> 58:30.338
very own Bobby Fischer.

58:30.382 --> 58:32.132
I don’t suppose
this next beneficiary

58:32.175 --> 58:34.795
would happen to be Matthew’s
brother Wyatt, would it?

58:35.971 --> 58:37.931
Let me see.

58:42.185 --> 58:43.385
Actually, no.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.649
It’s your sister.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.157
What?

59:02.414 --> 59:03.754
Riley.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.252
I’ll catch up with you.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.252
Sorry I haven’t called you back,
I’ve just been slammed

59:09.254 --> 59:12.474
with patients all day,
but, um, is something wrong?

59:13.425 --> 59:16.555
I’m gonna ask you a question
and I need the truth.

59:16.595 --> 59:18.725
Okay. Well,
now, you’re scaring me.

59:18.764 --> 59:20.774
Where were you
the night Matthew died?

59:20.807 --> 59:22.427
-Excuse me?
-I think you heard me.

59:22.434 --> 59:25.103
I don’t understand, though.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.563
Please, just answer
the question.

59:27.606 --> 59:29.936
-I was home.
-Can anyone verify that?

59:29.941 --> 59:31.481
I mean, not unless
you wanna subpoena

59:31.610 --> 59:33.740
my smart TV’s browsing history.

59:33.779 --> 59:36.909
Did you go over to mom’s house
that night?

59:36.948 --> 59:38.658
Hold on.
You think I have something to do

59:38.742 --> 59:40.492
-with what happened?
-You’re the one who insisted

59:40.577 --> 59:42.447
Matthew changed the will.

59:42.454 --> 59:45.584
Well, yes, but to benefit
our mother.

59:45.624 --> 59:47.634
Unless she gets convicted
of Matthew’s murder.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.457
In that case, what do you know?
It all goes to you,

59:49.461 --> 59:51.341
1.5 million dollars.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.086
You’re serious.

59:54.132 --> 59:55.632
Money like that would go
a long way

59:55.634 --> 59:57.969
in clearing up those debts,
don’t you think?

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.969
Okay, first of all,
that’s insane.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:04.604
Secondly, why on earth
would I insist that you,

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:07.813
who works at one of the most
well-known firms in the country,

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.943

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.691

Because you didn’t think
I’d actually come.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.987

you weren’t secretly

She’s still entitled
to a defense.

Look, I just don’t wanna see
anything happen to you.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.990
It’s gonna take
a lot more than some

to stop me from digging.

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.416
Goodbye?

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.762
I presented the deal
to my client,

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:22.428
advised her to take it,
and she fired me.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.720
Wait.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.013
Your mother fired you?

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.266
She’d rather take her chance
in court.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.097
Without you?

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:34.484
She doesn’t feel
I’m "in her corner".

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.107
[sighs] Oh God.

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.067
So she’s gonna go
with a public defender?

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.817
Yeah, maybe Chuck
can do a better job.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.401
Chuck hasn’t seen the inside
of a courtroom in over a year.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:42.736
It’s just like riding a bicycle.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.070
It’s nothing like
riding a bicycle.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.085
What do you want me to say?

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.447
Yes, she’s being stubborn,

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.747
but I can’t just wave
a magic lawyer wand

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.787
and change the woman’s mind.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.712
You have to.
You can’t just give up.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.041
Give up?

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.375
You act like
you’re the only lawyer

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.710
that’s had a stubborn client.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.760
You don’t know my mother
like I do.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.679
But I do know this case, Nicki.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.548
You’ve seen the evidence.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.347
You’ve read the witness
statements.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.807
She doesn’t need Chuck,
she needs a miracle.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.391
She needs you.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:15.436
So now you care about my mother?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.020
[Bobby] Actually, I don’t.

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.654
I think she’s a murderer

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.441
and frankly deserves to rot
in prison for what she did.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.066
Then why aren’t you celebrating?

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:30.197
Because I care about you, Nicki.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.704
And the old Nicki,

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:33.496
the Nicki that
I went to school with,

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.919
would’ve never walked away
from a challenge, ever.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.587
Well, the old Nicki
didn’t have a murderer

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.587
for a mother, allegedly.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.103
Well, there is one thing
I’m disappointed about.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.677
You’re disappointed?

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.516
I won’t be able to go up
against you in court.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.940
Although we both know
I would’ve won.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.019
Yeah, possibly.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:01.485
-Probably.

Well, hey, if you ever...

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.368
feel like relocating out west,

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:11.989
my offer still stands,
seriously.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.660
I appreciate that.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.875
Of course, that’s assuming

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.326
that your legal skills
are better

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:20.246
than your bar fighting skills.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:21.594

hadn’t interrupted us,

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:23.209

-Uh-hmm.

I better get back to the hotel.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:34.433
I need to pack...

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.555
before they charge me
another day.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.904
See you around, counselor.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.949

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.082
why things never worked out
between us?

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:59.671
Probably because
I always enjoyed a good fight.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.919
Ouch.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.089
Good luck.

-She fired me.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:38.118

about yesterday, I...

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.460
what’s this?

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.329
The footage
from my doorbell camera,

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.836
so that you can see that my car
was parked in front of my house

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:48.719
all night long
and that I never left.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.428
Look, I’m sorry, okay?

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:55.348
I just...I ran out of places
to look and I got desperate.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:14:00.891
Actually, I think it was
a pretty smart theory, so...

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.517
I mean, too bad I didn’t think
of it sooner, so.

01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:05.694
Too bad.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.856
So what happens now?

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.614
She’s someone else’s problem.

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.197
You mean the public defender.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:17.451
Maybe he’ll be able to convince
her to sign the deal.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.755
Do you think she did it?

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.329
I don’t know.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.964
Maybe no one did it.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.960
Maybe there never was another
person in the first place.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:28.512
Maybe the autopsy was wrong
and Matthew just fell.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.339
I wish I could change your mind
about leaving.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.967

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.564
Of course...

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.562
I didn’t wanna hurt
Matthew either.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.740
But he left me no choice.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:37.657
[suspenseful music]

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:50.760
[screams]

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.841
[both grunting]

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.191
Drop your weapon.

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:06.773
I said drop the weapon.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.114
I got your text.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.856
Yeah.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:20.701
[siren wailing]

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:25.709
Nicki.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:26.709
Are you okay?

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:27.790
Yes.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:28.918
Where is she?

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.462
With Charlene.

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:33.548
We’ve got your phone, Sadie.

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:35.052
We know all about
your relationship

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.643
with Matthew Rafferty.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.220
How he finally ended things

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.722
after his wife found
the latest messages.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.386
And judging from your texts
that you sent,

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.265
I’m guessing that didn’t
make you too pleased

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.942
with either one of them.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.230
You already confessed
to Nicole Ray an hour ago.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.895
Might as well come clean
for the record now.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:56.113
At first,
I was just going to talk,

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.236
smooth things over.

01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:03.754
And after seeing them together,

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.579
seeing the way she treated him,

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:11.632
and that he chooses her over me?

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.760
Yes, I was angry.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:21.136
And yes, I killed him.

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:24.933
He deserved it.

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.137
[scoffs]

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:31.817
Oh, Mom.

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.656
Thank you...

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:40.117
for never doubting me,

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:42.867
even when I was doubting you.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:44.449
I’m just doing my job.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:46.206
No.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:47.960
You were being my daughter.

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:57.303
Now, there are going to be
some changes around here.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.552
Charlene is getting me
into a treatment program

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:03.347
and I’m even gonna pick up
some shifts at the old diner.

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:08.898
Now, I’m fully aware that
this is going to be a journey

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:11.815
but I will get there, I promise.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:14.475
One step at a time.

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:17.154
I owe it to the both of you,

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:20.656
and to Matthew.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.579
You don’t have to do it alone,
Mom.

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:24.239
You’ll always have us.

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:27.325
Does that mean that
you’re gonna be sticking around

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.712
for a little more?

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.999
Well, the firm’s waited
this long.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.503
I don’t see why
they can’t wait a few more days.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:37.375
In the meantime, I was hoping
that I could stay at the house.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.094
Yes.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:41.176
Yes, of course.

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:44.008
You are always welcome.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:48.096
Good, because I plan on
stopping by a lot more often.

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:51.855
Or you could move back
permanently,

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:54.225
open up a little firm
in town.

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:56.727
[laughs]

01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:58.397
Like mom says,
one step at a time.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:25:59.863
[Riley] Okay.

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:02.032
I’m just saying.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.701
Now, how about a lift home?

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:07.037
Home.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:10.207
[dramatic music]

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:19.883
[dramatic music]
