WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.459
Good morning!

00:03.903 --> 00:06.269
Somebody didn't get home
until 10:30 last night, huh?

00:06.306 --> 00:09.298
Well, some of the editors wanted to
go out, so I went with them.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.105
And I got a tattoo!

00:11.144 --> 00:12.975
- What?
Who's Stu?

00:13.747 --> 00:14.771
Stu?

00:17.050 --> 00:18.984
It's supposed to say "Hot Stuff. "

00:19.019 --> 00:20.577
I sweated it off. It was hot in the club.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.288
Your mother would kill me.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.951
<i>Mi hija, it's not like you
to go out on a work night.</i>

00:25.992 --> 00:28.426
So? Maybe I want to mix it up.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.861
Matt's moving on,
he's dating someone new.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.625
I think it's time for me
to get back on the market.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.192
Hey, what about that nice guy
who does the bookkeeping for Archie?

00:36.236 --> 00:37.464
- Larry?
- Yeah.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.940
I don't know. When he gets nervous,
he does this sniffing thing.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.532
I don't think Betty wants a sniffer.

00:42.575 --> 00:43.633
Aunt Betty, did Marc say

00:43.676 --> 00:45.507
when the cheerleading uniforms
will be ready?

00:45.545 --> 00:48.173
Yes. He's gonna drop them off
on his way to work.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.445
Oh, thank God. Those hems have not
been brought up since 2003.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.543
They might as well
just be cheering in burkas.

00:53.586 --> 00:55.611
Who roped you
into helping the cheerleaders?

00:55.655 --> 00:56.713
It was Marc's idea.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.781
He said if I'm gonna
make it through high school,

00:58.825 --> 01:01.589
I have to be friends
with the popular-slash-mean girls.

01:01.628 --> 01:02.720
That's his advice?

01:02.762 --> 01:04.024
What does it matter?

01:04.063 --> 01:06.464
The point is he's having
a better time at school.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.057
Okay. So whoever's free this morning,

01:08.101 --> 01:11.264
we need help decorating the gym
for Homecoming.

01:13.706 --> 01:17.369
What? Why do I feel like
I should be hearing scary music?

01:17.644 --> 01:21.512
Your mother doesn't have the
best association with Homecoming.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.311
Do you want to know why?

01:23.349 --> 01:26.113
Because the year that
I was nominated Homecoming Queen,

01:26.152 --> 01:28.211
my father told me
I could not attend the ceremony!

01:28.254 --> 01:30.484
Hilda, I was protecting you!

01:30.523 --> 01:31.751
- You were ashamed of me!
- Guys!

01:31.791 --> 01:33.019
<i>- Never!
- Papi!</i>

01:35.128 --> 01:39.155
Justin, your mom was
six months pregnant with you,

01:39.199 --> 01:41.690
so Grandpa didn't think
it was a good idea for her to go.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.668
- Because he was ashamed of me!
- I was protecting you!

01:43.703 --> 01:48.333
Lies! But you know that you are
a blessing in my life, honey, right?

01:48.374 --> 01:50.171
- Yeah.
- That is true.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.070
How dare you say that?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.843
We'll come and help.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.716
I could have been queen, Betty.
I could have ruled all of this.

01:59.752 --> 02:03.654
I really think all you got was a bunch
of carnations and a ride on a golf cart.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.123
Yeah, to wave to my subjects.

02:06.526 --> 02:10.189
My God.
Is that Bobby Talercio?

02:15.235 --> 02:18.295
Bobby Talercio was the most
dangerous guy I ever went out with.

02:18.338 --> 02:19.965
One time this guy called me a whore,

02:20.006 --> 02:21.530
and Bobby slammed his head
against the wall

02:21.574 --> 02:25.203
and made him apologize.
I felt like such a princess.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.210
- Hilda?
- Hi!

02:30.250 --> 02:32.810
Get out of here! No way.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.650
- Oh, my God. Look at you.
- I know, right?

02:36.456 --> 02:38.981
- You look great.
- Oh, thank you.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.049
Jeez, don't tell me
this is little Chipmunk.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.254
This is little Chipmunk?

02:42.295 --> 02:44.695
- Oh, baby. Look at that face.
It is. The little...

02:44.731 --> 02:48.792
Ah! All right, look, I'd love to stay
and talk, but I've got to start a lesson.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.496
Oh, you're teaching Driver's Ed.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.937
Yeah. Part-time. You know,
family's got the car dealership,

02:52.972 --> 02:54.701
so I volunteer a few of the cars.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.732
- Nice.
- Look, I'll...

02:56.776 --> 02:59.904
- I'll see you around, all right?
- Okay. See you later.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.642
My God. He has still got it.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.651
- I used to have such a crush on him.
- No kidding.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.949
- You knew?
- Please!

03:07.987 --> 03:09.511
If it weren't for you
hanging around so much,

03:09.556 --> 03:11.683
Bobby would have been Justin's father.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.589
Remember the summer
he worked at Asadero's?

03:13.626 --> 03:16.094
You came back three times a day
for Freeze-atas.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.495
Yeah, I gained 9 pounds that summer.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.123
But you lost it.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.363
Remember how you guys used to
sit on the hood of his car?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.268
I used to always wish that would be me.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.500
That would
have been funny.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.768
Why?

03:28.808 --> 03:30.833
Because you could never
go out with a guy like Bobby.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.105
Why not?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.137
Because you're a good girl,
and he is a very bad boy.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.513
So? You don't know me. Maybe I could.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.553
Oh, please. Bobby smoked.

03:42.055 --> 03:47.687
Okay, here you go, top and skirt.
For you. Say, "Thank you. "

03:48.428 --> 03:52.455
See, Ava, if the skirt doesn't hit you
in the exact right place,

03:53.032 --> 03:56.524
- it could make your leg look chunky.
- Oh, my God. You saved my life.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.437
- Hey, Justin. Where's your skirt, huh?
- Shut up, Kevin.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.940
Okay, so let's talk about
what just happened.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.509
A lump of boy made fun of you
and you did nothing.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.050
What am I supposed to do?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.281
Get ahead of the joke, son.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.353
If he asks where your skirt is,

04:18.391 --> 04:21.019
say it's at the dry cleaner
with your opera cape.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.789
If you show them
that you're in on the joke,

04:22.829 --> 04:24.820
then they'll think
they're not getting to you,

04:24.864 --> 04:27.424
and they'll stop making fun of you.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.835
Okay, Miss Woman,
are we all happy now?

04:30.870 --> 04:34.169
Is there anything else my friend Justin
can do for you?

04:34.207 --> 04:37.802
Not unless he knows any routines.
We need fresh moves for Homecoming.

04:37.844 --> 04:41.211
Well, you're in luck.
It just so happens that Justin here

04:41.247 --> 04:43.545
has the moves of a young,
Mexican Beyoncé.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.641
I...

04:44.684 --> 04:47.152
And he would be happy to
choreograph it for you.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.916
Cool. See you at practice.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.917
Okay.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.454
What did you do?

04:55.662 --> 04:58.825
I mean, I helped out in junior high,
but this is Homecoming.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.958
This is like the Broadway of school.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.433
Worry not, youngling.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.062
It just so happens
I was head cheerleader in college,

05:05.104 --> 05:07.698
and I happen to know a move or two.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.908
So this water is
from the Community of the Phoenix?

05:13.946 --> 05:15.777
Yeah. It's full of vitamins. And, look,

05:15.815 --> 05:18.545
the cups have inspirational sayings
on them from Bennett.

05:18.584 --> 05:22.884
"If it's a mess, it's a message. "
I think I get it.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.752
You know, the Community's
really changed my life, Betty.

05:24.791 --> 05:25.917
I just... I feel better.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.119
You know, more energy,
Natalie's got me on this great diet.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.153
It's raw food, Phoenix water,
and that's it.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.494
You don't think
you need more than that?

05:32.532 --> 05:33.794
You want half my muffin?

05:33.833 --> 05:37.166
Muffin? Or poison. Come on.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.127
I thought that was a muffin.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.867
You know, cleansing is so important.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.638
Once you get rid of all those toxins,
it's just amazing the clarity you have.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.113
It's also crazy how much
you have to pee. Excuse me.

05:48.881 --> 05:51.247
Should I be worried about my son?

05:51.284 --> 05:54.344
I'd ask him myself, but we're not
really in that place right now.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.184
Well, he is acting a little loopy.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.589
But if this Community is helping him
deal with Molly's death,

05:59.625 --> 06:01.820
then I'm trying to
keep an open mind about it.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.556
I do like his new necklace.

06:03.596 --> 06:07.362
Ah! Just the girl I wanted to see.
I was talking to Betty, Mrs. Meade.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.890
You're not a girl.
I would never call you a girl.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.630
Well, I'm glad that's cleared up.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.663
Now I won't spend the afternoon
texting and worrying about boys.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.034
- I should talk less.
- Matt?

06:18.344 --> 06:20.574
Oh, uh, your assignment
for the "Fearless" issue.

06:20.613 --> 06:24.481
Oh! Thank you! Wait, wait, wait... Matt?

06:24.517 --> 06:27.111
"Horoscopes"
and "Cosmetic of the Month"?

06:27.153 --> 06:28.518
I'm not getting a features article?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.146
Look, I really wanted to give you one.

06:30.189 --> 06:31.781
But once the senior editors
picked what they wanted,

06:31.824 --> 06:33.655
all that was left was a POV piece.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.923
You know, an editor's personal story
of fearlessness.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.259
- Oh!
- I just thought that Megan

06:37.296 --> 06:38.490
would be better for that.

06:38.531 --> 06:42.433
- Can you sign this?
- Why? I'm just as fearless as Megan.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.667
What... Are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?

06:45.705 --> 06:46.729
- No, I'm not, I...
- Thank you.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.798
Okay, I am. But it's just...

06:48.841 --> 06:51.139
Look, don't get mad,
but when I think of you,

06:51.177 --> 06:53.270
I think of someone who's a little,

06:53.312 --> 06:55.371
I don't know, cautious.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.643
Well, maybe you're thinking
of the old Betty,

06:58.684 --> 07:02.882
'cause the new Betty is fearless.
Look, no bangs!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.617
Okay, look, nothing is set in stone.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.215
Give me some pitches.
I'd love to hear them.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.351
Okay.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.054
But something
a little bit more dangerous

07:09.095 --> 07:11.996
than turning in a story
without proofreading it.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.931
I would never do that.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.160
I do not appreciate blackmail calls
in the middle of a workday!

07:20.206 --> 07:24.165
Detective, you will have the money
when I get the money.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.442
Never cover up a murder
for your daughter.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.542
Well, if you have one fault,
it's that you love too much.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.688
Willie, I'm really starting to get worried.

07:36.722 --> 07:40.123
If you can't come up with the money,
you and Nico will go to jail!

07:40.159 --> 07:42.150
I'm aware of that, Marc!

07:48.868 --> 07:52.634
<i>Get on the phone.
I want you to call Vogue, Elle, Bazaar.</i>

07:52.672 --> 07:56.540
Tell them that Wilhelmina Slater
is available for modeling.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.544
Willing to do a cover.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.237
What?

08:00.813 --> 08:04.078
It's just models today tend to be...

08:05.384 --> 08:09.081
They often... And this is a terrible thing,
but usually what they're looking for...

08:09.121 --> 08:11.180
Yes, I know I'm not 19.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.058
But there are plenty of models
that are in their late 30s.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.693
- They can do wonders with airbrushing.
- Yes.

08:19.732 --> 08:22.758
A Wilhelmina Slater cover
will sell magazines.

08:22.802 --> 08:27.205
So unless you can come up with
another way to get money, start calling!

08:27.974 --> 08:31.375
Daniel, you think of me
as fearless, right?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.010
I mean, someone who takes risks?

08:34.046 --> 08:37.038
Sure. I mean, look at you.
No bangs, right?

08:38.284 --> 08:40.115
Yeah, okay.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.916
It just seems like everyone thinks of me
as this cautious person.

08:45.625 --> 08:50.392
And maybe I was in the past.
But now I want to be fearless.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.290
- Well, you can be.
- How?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.731
Well...

08:57.000 --> 09:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:08.147 --> 09:09.512
Bobby!

09:10.049 --> 09:12.142
Hey, what's up, Chipmunk?

09:12.785 --> 09:15.413
Well, it's not Chipmunk anymore.

09:15.454 --> 09:19.618
It's Betty.
And this bad girl wants to date you.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.252
Hey. Sweetie, what's up?

09:28.034 --> 09:29.058
Oh!

09:29.168 --> 09:31.693
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.863
Okay.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.334
Uh... Sorry, I wanted
to ask you something.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.934
Yeah, anything.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.307
I was wondering if...

09:42.848 --> 09:46.113
I mean, only if you have time...
If maybe...

09:46.152 --> 09:48.279
What do you need, Chipmunk?

09:48.688 --> 09:50.713
If you would want to

09:54.694 --> 09:57.458
- teach me how to drive?
- Yeah, of course!

09:59.398 --> 10:03.061
Is that all you wanted?
I mean, you seem a little nervous.

10:03.302 --> 10:06.567
Well, I also wanted this.

10:09.675 --> 10:13.372
Is that all you wanted?
I mean, you seem a little nervous.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.277
Yeah, that's it.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.492
- Hey!
- Hey.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.159
How did cheerleading practice go?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.793
This kid is a star.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.805
Honestly, it was like
he was born to yell at girls.

10:39.839 --> 10:40.863
Yay!

10:41.240 --> 10:44.676
Oh, Marc showed me this routine.
It got them going crazy.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.741
- Ready?
- Okay.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.582
Bravo!

10:56.622 --> 10:59.318
It kind of put me on the map in college.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.485
And we got invited
to Homecoming tomorrow!

11:01.527 --> 11:02.960
Good! That's really good!

11:02.995 --> 11:04.462
<i>- That's so great!
- That's wonderful, hijo!</i>

11:05.598 --> 11:08.123
There's Archie.
Marc, thank you so, so much.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.259
Yeah.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.929
<i>- Gracias, Marc.
- Maybe this time I'll get to go.</i>

11:11.971 --> 11:14.166
- I was protecting you!
- Ashamed!

11:15.007 --> 11:18.465
Okay, a glass of water and two saltines,
and I'm out of here.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.244
Now, look at me. Everything is gonna
be great and I will tell you why.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.243
If anybody gives you any crap,

11:26.285 --> 11:30.221
you know that
you are smarter and funnier.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.055
It's just the truth.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.496
I thought being the girlfriend
of a politician would be glamorous.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.057
I didn't think
I would spend my Saturday

11:42.101 --> 11:43.227
dressed like Barbara Bush,

11:43.269 --> 11:46.261
watching him plant a tree in front
of the Shalom Retirement Home.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.933
- That's not Archie.
- What?

11:50.676 --> 11:52.610
What is Bobby Talercio doing here?

11:52.645 --> 11:56.081
He's here for me.
He's gonna teach me how to drive.

11:56.115 --> 11:59.141
- You already know how to drive.
- Not a stick shift.

11:59.185 --> 12:02.484
<i>- Why do you need to learn that?
- Automatics are safer, mi hija.</i>

12:02.521 --> 12:05.081
<i>I know, papi.
Exactly why I want to learn.</i>

12:05.124 --> 12:07.285
I think it would make a great article
for the "Fearless" issue.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.920
What's scarier
than driving a stick in the city?

12:09.962 --> 12:12.430
All the teachers in Queens
and you pick Bobby?

12:12.498 --> 12:13.522
Mmm-hmm.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.166
Betty, I don't like that guy. He's a thug.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.330
I'm sure he's the one
who stole our baby Jesus.

12:19.371 --> 12:22.898
<i>Papi, come on. He's a nice guy.
Oh, Hilda, Archie's here.</i>

12:32.351 --> 12:34.478
That is wonderful, Marc!

12:34.520 --> 12:39.014
And you didn't think I could get a cover.
Now, tell me, where am I going?

12:40.159 --> 12:43.595
<i>Hot Flash would be thrilled
to have you on its cover.</i>

12:43.629 --> 12:45.221
In fact, as soon as I heard,

12:45.264 --> 12:48.791
I did a mock-up of
what I thought it should look like.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.732
Cackle all you want, Claire.

12:54.774 --> 13:00.076
But if I agree to do this,
I want final approval on all the photos

13:00.112 --> 13:02.945
and, of course, my usual fee.

13:03.749 --> 13:08.550
The fee is $500
and a liter of diet ginger ale.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.787
And I'd take it.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.553
Where else are you
going to find a magazine

13:13.592 --> 13:16.220
willing to put women of our age
on the cover?

13:17.463 --> 13:21.763
How dare you even suggest
we're near the same age?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.099
And I won't agree to such a small fee.

13:24.136 --> 13:29.369
<i>Well, it's the best I can do, Willie.
Now, Hot Flash is just an insert,</i>

13:29.408 --> 13:31.205
so you might have some staples
in your face.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.734
Oh, but you've had that before.

13:43.255 --> 13:46.418
Okay, okay. Easy on the clutch.
You want to be in third.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.552
- I think I am in third.
- No, you're in second.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.089
So, this is for an article, huh?

13:53.132 --> 13:55.362
- Yeah.
- Am I gonna be in it?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.129
Maybe.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.897
I can't believe little Betty's all grown up.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.465
<i>You know, a big shot at Mode.</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:05.909
I mean, I still think of you
in footy pajamas.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.176
Oh, God.
Please don't think of me that way.

14:09.215 --> 14:12.810
I wear regular nightgowns now.
Like, you can see my feet.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.945
I get it. You're all grown up.
Yeah, I know.

14:14.987 --> 14:19.117
Yeah, I've traveled,
had my own apartment.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.356
Boyfriends. Actually,
I just got out of a relationship,

14:23.395 --> 14:26.193
so I guess I'm back on the market.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.256
Oh!

14:27.299 --> 14:30.462
Okay. Okay, ease up.
Press on the clutch. Press.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.595
There you go. Okay, now, now look.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.697
You don't want to grip it too hard, okay?

14:34.740 --> 14:40.303
You just want to gently ease it,
guide it right where you want it to go.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.613
Hey! Watch what you're doing,
dumbass!

14:47.653 --> 14:48.711
I'm sorry!

14:48.754 --> 14:51.188
Okay, sweetie, don't worry about it.
Put the car in neutral.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.454
Good job. Pull up the emergency brake.
I'll be right back.

14:54.493 --> 14:55.551
Okay.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.357
You've got to watch
what you're doing, four-eyes!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.954
Hey. Come here!

15:01.066 --> 15:04.263
Now, you were jaywalking when
there's a clearly marked crosswalk.

15:04.303 --> 15:07.739
And worse than that, you were rude
to this young lady! Now, apologize!

15:07.773 --> 15:09.673
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

15:09.975 --> 15:14.002
That's better. Go. Go cross at the light.
It's the law, you bum.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.545
You okay?

15:26.759 --> 15:30.126
Amanda. What are you
doing here on a Saturday?

15:30.162 --> 15:32.790
Well, I'm not here because Matt came
in the last two out of four Saturdays,

15:32.831 --> 15:35.197
if that's what you're implying.

15:35.234 --> 15:39.136
But since you brought it up,
do you see Matt and I as a couple?

15:39.171 --> 15:42.470
Look, Amanda, you can't force
someone to have feelings for you.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.999
I mean, you tried that with me
and it didn't work.

15:45.044 --> 15:48.343
I gave you nothing.
Honestly, I kind of used you.

15:49.014 --> 15:53.212
Thanks, I feel better. And at least
I'll always have that cold sore.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.855
Look, all I'm saying is
you can change that pattern.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.817
I don't know if it's
all the herbs I've been taking

15:58.857 --> 16:00.848
or the fact that
I haven't eaten in four days,

16:00.893 --> 16:04.829
but I feel like
I'm seeing you for the first time.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.965
It's like I can see
what's missing in your life.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.661
- Matt.
- Self-esteem.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.262
Amanda, I think you should
attend these workshops

16:12.304 --> 16:14.932
- we're having here this weekend.
- You mean the dead people thing?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.442
No. Look, the Community's
about so much more than that.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.378
It's about finding your self-worth,
reaching your potential.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.712
Look, you're always saying you want to
move forward in your life, right?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.809
I really think
this might help you get there.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.479
Okay, I'll stay.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.683
If Matt sees me here,
he'll think I'm super complicated.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.601
Listen, you did a great job today,
Chipmunk.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.195
- Yeah?
- You did good.

16:47.239 --> 16:50.572
Hey, you only hit one pedestrian, huh?
All right.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.544
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Thanks.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.553
I was just thinking, you know,
it's Saturday night.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.945
You probably got big plans, right?

17:04.990 --> 17:06.513
No, I'm just going to
do what I always do.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.685
I go down to Mad Dog's and shoot pool.

17:08.727 --> 17:13.721
Oh, yeah, I know the place. The one
with the sign, "Warm beer, lousy food. "

17:14.599 --> 17:16.864
My dad says that place
is run by the Mob.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.104
My uncle runs it.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.230
Oh!

17:21.272 --> 17:24.867
- It's not so bad.
- I've always wanted to check it out.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.910
You should. Come by any time.
Come tonight.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:29.882 --> 17:35.149
Yeah! Okay. Maybe.
Yeah, you know, if I have time.

17:35.654 --> 17:39.454
<i>Papi, I'm going to be out late tonight!
I have plans!</i>

17:39.525 --> 17:41.686
Well, now you have other plans.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.161
Betty, meet my bookkeeper, Larry.

17:45.931 --> 17:50.459
He's here for you! We're all gonna have
a double date. Won't that be fun?

17:57.309 --> 18:01.211
So that turned out to be a pretty big war
between me and that squirrel.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.771
I was pretty sure he was
the one stealing my carrots.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.875
So you know what I did?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.548
What?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.352
I set up one of those
long-exposure cameras.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.552
I got it from that catalog
they give you on the plane

18:14.593 --> 18:16.527
when I was visiting
my mom in Syracuse.

18:16.562 --> 18:20.430
She just redid the roof.
But that's another story.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.664
- I forgot what I was saying.
- The squirrel, man.

18:27.706 --> 18:31.198
Oh, right. Well, you'll never guess
who turned out to be the carrot thief.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.733
The squirrel?

18:34.012 --> 18:37.209
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was the squirrel.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.820
Man, I'm so surprised
at how late it got.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.379
What are you talking about?

18:45.424 --> 18:48.985
It's 9:00. Why don't we all
play a game or something?

18:49.161 --> 18:52.130
- Since when do you like games?
- I love games.

18:52.831 --> 18:56.631
I have so much work
that I have to do in the morning,

18:56.668 --> 18:59.000
and I really should just hit the hay.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.597
But, Larry,
it was really nice to meet you.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.107
You, too.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.200
Have a good night.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.733
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.708
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

19:46.084 --> 19:49.815
I don't know about you,
but I am stoked for this weekend.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.289
And, yes, I just said "stoked. "

19:52.324 --> 19:56.226
Hey, Natalie. I'm doing it, too.
I'm going to get cured or whatever.

19:56.261 --> 19:59.526
Yes. Daniel brought a friend
to join us this weekend.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.557
Started recruiting for you already.
Maybe I'll earn something free.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.630
So far, I am loving everything.
Except for these beads.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.697
I don't love the way
they frame my chesticles.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.436
They'll look better
when we shave your head.

20:11.476 --> 20:12.602
What?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.275
Kidding.

20:15.247 --> 20:18.842
We always say that to the newcomers.
We like to have fun.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.709
So are you doing the whole weekend?

20:20.786 --> 20:21.980
Uh...

20:22.020 --> 20:24.682
I hope so. That reminds me,
there's this literature on phasing

20:24.723 --> 20:29.023
- I really wanted to show you. Come on.
- You did not tell me I had to read.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.791
She is gonna ruin this.
I need him to get to Level Five.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.924
Pull it together, Natalie.
There's still time.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.826
Well, we're running out of time!

20:36.868 --> 20:38.529
Isn't there another way
you can get money?

20:38.837 --> 20:41.397
Oh, for God's sake, Nico,
lower your voice.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.964
Angela Lansbury lives next door,

20:43.008 --> 20:45.067
and she'd love to rat me out
to the co-op board.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.340
Why am I the only one freaking out?

20:47.379 --> 20:50.109
Because I took
two of my headache pills.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.676
And there is one other option.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.820
- Well, then do it.
- It's not that simple.

20:59.191 --> 21:04.595
It would mean giving up everything.
My career, my life here. Everything.

21:05.964 --> 21:09.331
- What is it?
- It's not what. It's who.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.265
Connor Owens.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.580
How was your night?

21:29.121 --> 21:32.716
- Hi! I went out.
- Yeah, I got that.

21:33.492 --> 21:37.189
Hey. I was just making sure
Betty got in all right. You know?

21:37.229 --> 21:39.993
There were always a lot of rough guys
in this neighborhood.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.499
I guess that was me.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.564
You look good, Hilda.

21:47.606 --> 21:51.542
I usually look a lot better.
I threw on this robe by accident.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.709
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, Chipmunk.

21:54.746 --> 21:55.872
Okay.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.618
You are really something.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.020
You blow off a perfectly nice guy
like Larry to sneak around with Bobby?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.691
Oh, come on, Hilda!
You said it yourself. Larry's a sniffer.

22:08.727 --> 22:12.527
Well, so what? You're a chewer,
I'm a yeller. We all got something.

22:12.564 --> 22:15.055
Look, I just wanted to go out
and have some fun, okay?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.158
Is that so bad?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.066
Well, you are not gonna
have fun with that one.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.867
Trust me. He is exactly
the wrong kind of guy for you.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.966
And what makes Larry the right guy?
That he's boring and nerdy?

22:25.010 --> 22:29.037
Yeah, well, that boring
and nerdy guy has feelings, okay?

22:29.081 --> 22:32.016
And let me tell you,
you were really mean tonight.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.210
What do you mean?

22:33.251 --> 22:36.084
He heard you, Betty.
He heard you leave.

22:36.655 --> 22:41.718
"Oh, God, I'm so tired!
I'm gonna go to bed!"

22:41.760 --> 22:45.389
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!
I didn't mean for him to hear me!

22:45.831 --> 22:48.925
Well, I could call him. I can apologize.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.128
Well, he wanted to
come to Homecoming with us.

22:51.169 --> 22:54.832
- But since you hate him...
- I didn't say that I hate him.

22:56.808 --> 23:01.040
Well, maybe we could all go together.
Get something to eat after.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.541
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.417
With the money Connor stole,

23:09.454 --> 23:11.979
he practically wiped out
Meade Publications.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.547
How much money was there?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.583
Enough to pay off the detective

23:15.627 --> 23:18.391
and to live very well
for the rest of our lives.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.727
But...

23:19.765 --> 23:23.030
I mean, you said he could be anywhere.
How could you ever find him?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.866
I won't. He'll find me.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.428
Come away with me.

23:28.473 --> 23:32.341
Wilhelmina, you have always
lived your life a certain way.

23:32.377 --> 23:35.938
But when you're ready
to pursue another option with me,

23:35.981 --> 23:38.415
just put it out there, I'll find you again.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.210
Could you do that?
You'd give up everything?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.314
God, Nico, I don't know.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.659
Mom, do you still love him?

23:54.266 --> 23:58.202
Then you have to do this.
And not for me.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.768
Do this for yourself.

24:07.145 --> 24:10.603
I must admit, I am intrigued by
this emergency Sunday meeting.

24:10.649 --> 24:15.143
What is it now? You're dropping
modeling to start a line of skateboards?

24:15.520 --> 24:19.422
I'm afraid
it's nothing quite so colorful, Claire.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.417
I wanted to give you plenty of time
to find my replacement.

24:24.095 --> 24:27.861
- Excuse me?
- I quit.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.573
- Didn't stall once.
- Damn!

24:40.912 --> 24:44.211
You know there's nothing sexier
than a woman that can shift like a pro.

24:44.249 --> 24:47.309
- And you were scared to drive a stick.
- I know!

24:47.352 --> 24:50.412
You were fearless. Fearless.
That's great.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.052
- Oh, God.
- What? What's the matter?

24:55.093 --> 24:58.995
- I sort of have a date with that guy.
- Which one?

24:59.364 --> 25:02.299
- The guy in the dad jeans.
- You don't seem like you want to go.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.497
Not really.
I mean, he's a nice guy, but...

25:05.537 --> 25:07.232
Yeah, well, blow him off.
Let's go get a Freeze-ata.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.740
Are you crazy? I could never do that.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.743
I'd say that's a good enough reason
to do it.

25:21.786 --> 25:23.686
Easy on the clutch.

25:26.224 --> 25:27.714
Sorry, Larry!

25:29.194 --> 25:30.456
Betty!

25:38.003 --> 25:39.766
Okay, kids, it's get-real time.

25:39.804 --> 25:43.205
We just spent two hours with
a fat chick telling us how to breathe.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.266
Didn't we learn that
when we were, like, five?

25:45.310 --> 25:47.244
Hey, you just got to give it time.
Right, Natalie?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.406
Or it's just not for her
and she goes home.

25:49.447 --> 25:50.573
- Jeez.
- Wow.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.481
Good thing she doesn't work
at the welcome table.

25:53.518 --> 25:56.214
Look, I'm sorry,
but we've wasted half the weekend.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.085
Daniel, we have to get to Level Five.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.556
Yeah, or we just do it another time.

25:59.591 --> 26:00.888
Wait, what's Level Five?

26:00.926 --> 26:03.292
Is that where you touch each other's
junk and call it a massage?

26:03.328 --> 26:05.694
- I want to do it.
- No, it's not!

26:05.897 --> 26:09.890
Look, why is she even here?
She's not even in our energy group.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.765
Did you just really say that?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.006
Natalie.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.938
Amanda, we take this stuff
pretty seriously.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.071
Daniel, I know
and that's what scares me.

26:22.113 --> 26:26.516
I think all this cleansing and vitamins
isn't just giving you bad breath,

26:26.551 --> 26:30.009
it's giving you bad judgment.
Why can't you see that all this is crap?

26:30.055 --> 26:33.582
Look, just because you don't get it
doesn't mean it's crap.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.890
Daniel, I know you miss Molly, but...

26:36.962 --> 26:40.728
You have no idea
what I'm going through.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.600
You know what?
This was a mistake. You should go.

26:43.635 --> 26:44.966
Daniel.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.804
I can't believe I did that.
That is so not me.

26:53.845 --> 26:56.211
Don't feel bad, Chipmunk.
The guy's not right for you. That's it.

26:56.247 --> 27:00.877
That's what I said. But everyone else
thinks he's perfect for me.

27:01.886 --> 27:04.354
Why do people think
they know me so well?

27:04.389 --> 27:07.256
People like to do that.
You know, they like to put you in a box.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.453
Makes it easier for them.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.019
Listen, you don't let them do that,
all right?

27:12.063 --> 27:16.261
You're pretty, you're a smart girl.
You can date anybody you want.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.165
You've got to try this.
I mixed the cherry with the blue one

27:22.207 --> 27:25.233
and the root beer.
It's disgusting and delicious.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.141
You've got to try it.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.508
Look, Bobby, this is how I see it.

27:34.552 --> 27:38.886
You get me, I get you.
Let's make it work.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.552
Ow!

27:43.595 --> 27:46.155
Hey. Put your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.358
There you go. You all right?

27:54.472 --> 27:57.236
You know,
it's so crazy seeing you again.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.376
Yeah. A lot has changed.

28:00.612 --> 28:04.275
I can't even remember
why Hilda and I ever broke up.

28:04.315 --> 28:06.215
Oh, I know. I went to jail.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.384
Yeah, anyway, I think about Hilda a lot.

28:12.057 --> 28:15.891
It kills me to think I ever let her go.
Is she seeing anyone?

28:18.296 --> 28:19.888
Yeah. She is.

28:22.467 --> 28:25.766
I guess we always want
what we can't have, right?

28:27.072 --> 28:28.198
Yeah.

28:32.510 --> 28:35.070
I should probably get
to Homecoming now.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.043
I heard your friend left.

28:44.956 --> 28:47.220
You got the beads, didn't you?

28:48.827 --> 28:49.851
Ah!

28:51.162 --> 28:53.027
It's so hard, isn't it?

28:53.064 --> 28:57.125
The decision to let go
of the people holding us back.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.468
But it means you know
what you want, Daniel.

29:01.506 --> 29:05.567
And it means I was right.
It's time for you to go to Level Five.

29:07.812 --> 29:10.042
Bennett, what is Level Five?

29:10.081 --> 29:12.879
It's where you're reunited with Molly.

29:13.051 --> 29:17.181
You mean in like a spiritual
"she's all around me" kind of way?

29:18.223 --> 29:21.215
No. I mean actually be with her.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.155
Feel her, touch her.

29:25.797 --> 29:29.198
Your relationship with Molly
doesn't have to be over.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.592
I'm sorry.

29:34.305 --> 29:37.240
You have to know that sounds...

29:37.275 --> 29:38.765
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

29:38.810 --> 29:41.779
Well, maybe it is.
Maybe your friend is right.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.543
And you're certainly free to leave.

29:44.582 --> 29:49.281
But tonight, when you lay in bed,
missing Molly,

29:50.054 --> 29:54.753
I hope you don't regret having given up
the possibility of seeing her again.

30:21.352 --> 30:24.344
<i>Papi, I'm sorry I'm late. Is Larry upset?</i>

30:24.923 --> 30:27.653
No, actually, I think he was relieved.

30:28.159 --> 30:32.357
He was worried he wasn't wearing
enough layers. Archie drove him home.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.421
Oh.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.026
Well, why aren't you inside?

30:36.968 --> 30:39.129
I needed a few minutes
away from your sister.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.434
Yeah, I think I need a few minutes
to myself, too.

30:41.472 --> 30:44.134
She's been in such a mood.
She won't stop with the...

30:44.175 --> 30:46.541
I know, I know.
You were ashamed of her.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.569
I was protecting her!

30:51.249 --> 30:52.876
What did I say?

30:53.484 --> 30:56.385
After much consideration,
I must announce

30:56.421 --> 31:00.687
that the "Fearless" shoot
in the Bahamas will be my last.

31:00.892 --> 31:04.487
<i>I am resigning from Mode
to pursue other options.</i>

31:05.430 --> 31:06.590
Options?

31:06.764 --> 31:10.029
Now, I know that over the years,
the press has had a lot of fun

31:10.068 --> 31:11.228
at my expense.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.635
You've called me the "meaner Hitler. "

31:13.671 --> 31:15.639
You've said that I was completely bald

31:15.673 --> 31:18.267
and my wigs were made
from orphan hair.

31:18.309 --> 31:21.801
You've had me sleeping with everyone
from Madonna to JFK,

31:21.846 --> 31:23.905
only one of which is true.

31:25.483 --> 31:28.077
Yes, we've had our fun over the years.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.587
But I ask for one thing in return.

31:31.089 --> 31:34.752
That you quote me exactly as I say,

31:35.727 --> 31:39.686
"Wilhelmina Slater is leaving
to pursue other options. "

31:44.669 --> 31:49.265
So, Betty, I hear from some of
the cheerleaders that we're dating.

31:49.941 --> 31:52.876
How serious are we?
I need to introduce you to my mother?

31:52.911 --> 31:56.506
Oh, my God. I did not say that. I swear.

31:57.181 --> 32:01.811
I mean, I didn't not say that.
This is really embarrassing.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.548
Hey. Come on, Chipmunk,
don't worry about it.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.183
Kids say stuff, so what?
Look, when's our next lesson?

32:08.860 --> 32:12.455
Bobby, I don't think
we should do any more lessons.

32:12.497 --> 32:14.488
Why? Sweetie,
you need more practice.

32:14.532 --> 32:15.931
Yeah.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.532
It wasn't really ever about the driving.

32:22.273 --> 32:26.471
I just wanted an excuse
to hang out with you.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.712
Get out of here. What do you mean?

32:29.747 --> 32:35.014
I guess I just wanted to be the kind
of girl who could date a guy like you.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.952
What do you mean, "A guy like me"?
I don't even know what that means.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.786
In my family, you know, I'm a wuss.

32:39.824 --> 32:42.258
No! Come on, you're cool.

32:42.927 --> 32:46.454
I had the biggest crush on you
when I was a kid.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.366
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.
- Wait, you knew?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.125
Yeah, I knew.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.398
I mean, come on,
you were always around.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.599
If you'd have given Hilda and me
five minutes alone,

32:55.640 --> 32:58.803
- I'd have been Justin's father.
- Yeah, that's what Hilda said.

32:58.843 --> 33:04.281
I just remember all I ever wanted
was to kiss you in the hallway

33:04.315 --> 33:07.011
like you kissed all your girlfriends.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.117
We're in a hallway.

33:11.856 --> 33:15.155
No. Thank you, but I'm okay.

33:16.361 --> 33:19.194
All right. I'll see you around, Betty.

33:23.868 --> 33:24.994
Wait.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.008
That was sweet.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.416
Listen, don't worry about
anybody putting you in a box.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.451
You were the weirdest kid I knew,
ever, okay?

33:50.495 --> 33:54.124
You still are a little bit.
And that's a good thing.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.858
You understand?

34:11.315 --> 34:15.081
Shamans in South America
have used this tea for centuries.

34:15.119 --> 34:17.713
It enables them
to become intermediaries

34:17.755 --> 34:21.213
between the spirit world and our world.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.822
Oh, that's nasty.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.565
Try it with a squeeze of lemon.
It really helps.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.873
- Hilda, what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong, Betty.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.112
You want to make out with Bobby
in the hallway, go ahead.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.585
I guess that's who you are now, right?

34:49.620 --> 34:52.088
Don't worry, Hilda.
I'm still exactly who you want me to be.

34:52.123 --> 34:55.286
I will always be your less attractive,
less cool, geeky little sister.

34:55.326 --> 34:56.815
So no need to get jealous.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.761
What are you talking about?
I'm not jealous.

34:58.796 --> 35:00.525
Well, you're certainly acting that way.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.363
Which is stupid,
because I may have just kissed Bobby,

35:03.401 --> 35:05.961
but all he ever talks about is you.

35:10.675 --> 35:14.167
I've got to get inside.
The ceremony's about to start.

35:14.645 --> 35:18.046
I'm sensing tension
between the Sisters Suarez.

35:18.082 --> 35:20.277
<i>Or as your people call it, la pasión.</i>

35:20.318 --> 35:24.345
- It's nothing.
- Ava, why aren't you practicing?

35:24.388 --> 35:26.583
Your high V's are too low
and your low V's are too high.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.751
And I won't even bring up
your candlestick.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.819
- I feel bad about Justin.
- Justin? Why?

35:32.296 --> 35:37.666
- I really like him. It wasn't my idea.
- What? What wasn't your idea?

35:41.806 --> 35:46.709
<i>And this year's Homecoming King is</i>

35:47.211 --> 35:49.441
<i>Brandon Floyd!</i>

35:58.489 --> 35:59.888
- We're leaving?
- We've got to go, right now.

35:59.924 --> 36:01.016
- Why?
- I'll explain later.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.355
We've just got to go now.

36:02.393 --> 36:06.887
<i>And this year's Homecoming Queen is</i>

36:07.632 --> 36:11.534
<i>Justin Suarez!</i>

36:16.807 --> 36:18.468
I'm gonna sue this school.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.067
Come on, son. Let's go home.
Come on.

36:20.111 --> 36:22.477
Justin, let's just go. Come on.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.944
Justin, you can't go up there.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.548
It's okay.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.022
Right on, Justine!

36:34.058 --> 36:35.389
What am I gonna do?
I've got to do something.

36:35.426 --> 36:38.156
<i>You can't always protect him, mi hija.</i>

36:49.240 --> 36:52.801
<i>Oh, my God! Thank you so much.</i>

36:52.843 --> 36:56.506
<i>I'm so honored.
Nothing can ruin this day.</i>

36:56.547 --> 36:59.072
<i>Even this tacky baby's breath.</i>

36:59.116 --> 37:00.242
<i>But, I mean, come on, guys.</i>

37:00.284 --> 37:04.050
<i>I think you can do a little bit better
for your queen.</i>

37:04.288 --> 37:05.846
<i>I'd say, "Off with your heads,"</i>

37:05.890 --> 37:09.087
<i>but for some of you
that might not matter.</i>

37:11.562 --> 37:12.586
Snap!

37:13.764 --> 37:16.528
<i>As much as I hate
giving up an accessory,</i>

37:16.567 --> 37:20.901
<i>I think there's someone who deserves
this a little bit more than I do.</i>

37:21.872 --> 37:23.339
<i>My mom.</i>

37:23.841 --> 37:28.938
<i>She's an amazing person and should
have gotten this 15 years ago.</i>

37:29.580 --> 37:32.048
<i>But that's kind of my fault.</i>

37:33.351 --> 37:36.286
<i>She's with me every step of the way,</i>

37:36.320 --> 37:40.017
<i>and that's pretty hard,
because I'm a high-maintenance kid.</i>

37:40.524 --> 37:42.583
<i>So thank you.</i>

38:18.929 --> 38:20.521
Justin, you were amazing!

38:20.564 --> 38:23.624
- You were smart and sassy and fresh.
- So handsome! So cool!

38:23.668 --> 38:25.829
And in 10 years, you're going to
be at the top of your game.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.030
And that guy is going to be bald

38:27.071 --> 38:28.299
and he won't even
be able to see his feet.

38:28.339 --> 38:31.103
Yeah! What you did up there took guts.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.576
Honey, you know I love you, right?

38:33.611 --> 38:35.943
No matter who you are.
So what those kids are saying about...

38:35.980 --> 38:39.882
Mom. It's a joke. I'm just playing along.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.209
I'm not gay.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.649
Then he's not.

39:00.705 --> 39:03.299
- I can't sleep.
- Me neither.

39:14.318 --> 39:17.776
I don't want you to be anybody
but who you want to be.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.320
I know.

39:22.193 --> 39:27.324
I guess now I'm a woman
who knows how to drive stick shift.

39:29.633 --> 39:31.294
Hell, yeah!

39:32.937 --> 39:36.998
So I figured out what I'm going to
pitch for the "Fearless" issue.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.872
You making out with Bobby
in the hallway?

39:40.411 --> 39:41.673
No.

39:43.614 --> 39:44.842
You.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.776
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

39:49.153 --> 39:51.951
Hilda, you're the bravest person I know.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.423
You dated guys like Bobby.

39:57.628 --> 40:00.495
You went to school
when you were pregnant.

40:00.798 --> 40:05.235
And you held your head up high
no matter what anybody said about you.

40:08.205 --> 40:11.436
And you raised the bravest kid
in the whole world.

40:13.277 --> 40:14.904
I did, didn't I?

40:17.381 --> 40:19.212
Thanks, that's sweet.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.948
Don't forget to mention the salon.

40:23.988 --> 40:27.424
It's actually really funny
that you were jealous of me.

40:27.458 --> 40:31.189
What? I was not jealous of you.

40:31.228 --> 40:34.425
I wasn't. I was jealous of me.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.891
I mean, you know,
the person that I was.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.298
When did I get so boring?

40:46.177 --> 40:48.407
Are you not happy with Archie?

40:48.446 --> 40:51.210
No. No, no, no. No.

40:51.615 --> 40:55.642
Archie's great, I'm just talking.
I don't know.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.192
Did you know that Archie
is short for Archibald?

41:14.438 --> 41:16.235
Hilda and Archibald.

41:23.747 --> 41:28.275
Given the situation, it's going to be
a lot harder to track the stolen money.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.651
- What's going on?
- Excuse me.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.984
It's about Connor Owens.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.494
They found his body washed up
on a beach in Panama.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.759
He's dead. I'm so sorry, Wilhelmina.

41:48.072 --> 41:50.165
Thank you for telling me.
