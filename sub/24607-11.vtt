WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.524
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.567 --> 00:03.786
ONE OF THE ABSCESSES
BROKE APART.

00:03.829 --> 00:05.266
IT WAS THE SOUND WAVES.

00:05.309 --> 00:08.051
-FIX ME AND GET YOUR FIX.
-NO.

00:08.095 --> 00:11.011
YOUR DISEASE
VERSUS MINE.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.099
SOMETHING TELLS ME

00:12.142 --> 00:13.665
YOU'LL BREAK
BEFORE I DIE.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.624
OCTAVIA: THE HYDROFARM
IS BARELY FEEDING US.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.409
SO, IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

00:18.453 --> 00:19.758
THEN IT SHOULD BE OURS.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.065
MILLER: 50% OF OUR PEOPLE
WON'T MARCH.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.588
IT'S MADI.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.981
UHH. AAH!

00:25.025 --> 00:26.417
MILLER: THE FACT THAT
THERE'S A COMMANDER OUT THERE

00:26.461 --> 00:27.679
HAS COMPLICATED THINGS.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.117
THE HYDROFARM
IS WORKING AGAIN.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.379
GO TO WAR IF YOU WANT TO,

00:31.422 --> 00:33.337
BUT AT LEAST TELL THEM
THAT THEY HAVE A CHOICE.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.905
-TOOK AWAY THEIR CHOICE.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.081
VINSON: I KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO NEED SOMETHING.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.126
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?

00:39.169 --> 00:40.344
UHH!

00:41.302 --> 00:42.868
MOM, WAKE UP!

00:47.134 --> 00:48.613
MOM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:48.657 --> 00:51.094
I NEED YOU TO SWALLOW
THIS TUBE, OK?

00:55.142 --> 00:58.275
PLEASE LET ME
DO THIS. UHH.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.624
OK. GIVE ME THE SALINE.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.323
I NEED YOU TO HOLD
THE FUNNEL UP HIGH, OK?

01:02.366 --> 01:03.280
GOOD.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.286
STAND BACK.

01:26.347 --> 01:30.351
MCCREARY: DOC, WE READY
TO GET BACK TO WORK?

01:34.746 --> 01:36.879
HOW THE HELL
DID YOU GET HERE?

01:42.363 --> 01:44.104
CLARKE: STOP JUST BEFORE
MIDNIGHT.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.193
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.499
OK. PLAY IT FORWARD.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.162
A 24-HOUR LOOP.
CLEVER.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.209
-NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO SEE MY--

02:02.252 --> 02:04.298
ASSUMING THEY LEFT
THIS MORNING,

02:04.341 --> 02:06.474
6 DAYS, MAYBE 7.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.953
OVERRIDE THE LOOP.
I WANT TO KNOW

02:07.997 --> 02:08.998
WHERE THE HELL
THEY ARE.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.391
MAN: BROTHER,
IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES

02:10.434 --> 02:11.653
TO FIND REWIND.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.321
YOU'RE ALL SICK.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.322
THAT'S WHY
YOU TOOK MY MOM

02:28.365 --> 02:29.758
WITH YOU FROM POLIS,

02:29.801 --> 02:31.238
WHY YOU HELPED US
OPEN THE BUNKER.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.414
YES, AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE BACK,

02:33.457 --> 02:36.112
SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY
DO HER JOB.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.635
TAKE THESE
TO THE DOC.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.550
IF SHE'S STILL OUT,
FORCE A FEW OF THEM
DOWN HER THROAT.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.031
LET'S GET OUR
FUNCTIONAL JUNKIE
FUNCTIONING AGAIN.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.120
WAIT.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.558
JUNKIE?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.821
OH, I'M SORRY
TO BREAK IT TO YOU.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.303
SHE JUST OVERDOSED.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.218
IF YOU GIVE HER MORE NOW,
SHE COULD DIE.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.351
WELL, THEN WE HAVE
A PROBLEM.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.482
I TELL YOU WHAT.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.223
YOU PUMPED HER
STOMACH, SO,

03:00.267 --> 03:01.355
OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE
SOME SKILLS.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.052
I'LL GIVE YOU
24 HOURS

03:03.095 --> 03:04.793
TO GET HER
OPERATING AGAIN.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.447
ONCE SHE'S
BACK ON HER FEET,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.100
IF SHE STILL WON'T
CURE US...

03:10.146 --> 03:11.452
WELL, I GUESS
YOU BOTH GET

03:11.495 --> 03:12.975
TO WATCH
YOUR DAUGHTERS DIE.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.899
RAVEN: WHAT?

04:07.943 --> 04:10.293
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN'T FIX?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.730
EXCEPT MY LEG? NOPE.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.430
I MEAN, IT DID
TAKE HER 6 YEARS

04:16.473 --> 04:18.083
TO GET US BACK DOWN
TO THE GROUND.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.302
YET HERE WE ARE.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.130
HE HATES WHEN
I'M THAT GOOD.

04:21.173 --> 04:24.133
CAREFUL. CAVE'S NOT
BIG ENOUGH TO FIT
YOUR HEAD.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.439
SEE?

04:25.482 --> 04:28.180
OK, WELL, THEN WHAT
ABOUT ELIGIUS THREE?

04:28.224 --> 04:31.488
AH, SHE HAS
THE LOOK OF FAILURE
RIGHT THERE.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.489
WHEN WE WERE
ON THE MOTHERSHIP,

04:32.533 --> 04:33.534
I HACKED
THE ELIGIUS FILES.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.710
I JUST COULDN'T
CRACK THAT ONE.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.102
EMORI: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ALL SET.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.453
THE ANTENNA'S AIMED AT POLIS.
FIRE IT UP.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.541
IT'S NOT
CONNECTED YET.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.585
EMORI: SO, CONNECT IT.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.195
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU GOT SPOTTED?

04:43.239 --> 04:46.111
ECHO: WORSE.
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR US ANYMORE.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.243
DIYOZA: WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

04:51.029 --> 04:54.424
ECHO: OK...YOU WANT
TO BE USEFUL?

04:55.817 --> 04:57.427
WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT
FROM THE ANTENNA POSITION,

04:57.471 --> 04:58.820
WE SAW
YOUR PEOPLE MOVING

04:58.863 --> 05:01.649
WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES
TO THE NORTHERN PERIMETER?

05:01.692 --> 05:04.608
IF MCCREARY'S MOVING
HIS TROOPS NORTH,

05:04.652 --> 05:07.568
THEN WONKRU'S
ON THE MARCH AGAIN.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.526
SO MUCH FOR
BLINDING THE EYE.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.919
QUIET, MURPHY.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.015
UNLESS WE KNOW
ALL THE FACTS.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.365
DIYOZA: THE FACTS ARE
I GOT PLAYED.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.889
THEY HACKED
THE EYE IN THE SKY.

05:24.933 --> 05:25.977
I'M IMPRESSED.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.457
DON'T BE.

05:27.501 --> 05:30.025
IF MCCREARY KNOWS
THEY'RE COMING,

05:30.068 --> 05:31.505
THEN WE'VE FAILED.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.376
WITHOUT THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE,

05:33.420 --> 05:35.509
IT'LL BE A MASSACRE.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.554
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM
TO GO BACK.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.251
LET'S GET
THIS THING ON TOP.

06:12.676 --> 06:13.764
-ECHO...
-WAIT.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.287
SHE'S SPEAKING TRIG
FOR A REASON.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.341
THEY KNOW
WE'RE COMING.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.255
CLARKE?

06:26.298 --> 06:27.299
BELLAMY: IT HAD TO BE.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.389
BELLAMY, IF CLARKE'S
ON THEIR SIDE,

06:29.432 --> 06:31.216
SHE SPEAKS TRIG, TOO.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.523
MURPHY: CLARKE'S ON THEIR SIDE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.307
ECHO: IT MEANS WE HAVE
TO MAKE THIS FAST.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.076
WE'RE ON IT.
BE SAFE.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.034
OVER AND OUT.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.166
CLARKE AND MCCREARY?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.647
IF IT'S TRUE, I'LL
DEAL WITH HER LATER.

07:10.691 --> 07:11.735
LINDO.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.652
TAKE YOUR PEOPLE
AND SCOUT SOUTH.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.611
STAY OUT OF SIGHT
AND DON'T ENGAGE.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.222
WE NEED DETAILS ON TROOP COUNT
AND WEAPONS.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.789
SPACEKRU, YOU'RE WITH ME.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.399
YEAH.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.400
GUN.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.534
KANE: I'M GOING WITH YOU.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.622
THE HELL YOU ARE.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.493
TRUST HAS TO BE EARNED.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.060
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
COLONEL?

07:44.159 --> 07:45.334
LET'S ROLL.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.857
MAN, I NEVER
GET THE GUN.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.251
RAVEN:
YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.295
RAVEN, YOU NEED MY HELP.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.167
WRONG. WHAT WE NEED
IS FOR MCCREARY

07:52.210 --> 07:53.647
TO NOT BE ABLE
TO LAUNCH MISSILES

07:53.690 --> 07:54.996
INTO OUR FRIENDS AGAIN.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.433
YOU'D THINK I'D DO THAT
IF I GOT CAUGHT?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.695
I THINK TORTURE
HAS A WAY OF

07:58.739 --> 08:00.001
CHANGING PEOPLE'S
MINDS.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.351
I WON'T BE LONG.

08:15.712 --> 08:16.974
SHE'S AWAKE.

08:19.063 --> 08:19.977
MOM?

08:22.676 --> 08:23.677
CLARKE?

08:24.808 --> 08:26.593
-HI.
-HOW...

08:28.725 --> 08:31.728
MOM, NO.
HEY. HEY.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.775
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.777
MOM, I NEED YOU.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.865
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.955
OCTAVIA'S ARMY WILL
BE HERE IN 5 DAYS.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.087
UNLESS YOU TREAT
MCCREARY'S PEOPLE...

08:43.131 --> 08:44.698
-CLARKE, NO.
-MADI, THIS IS

08:44.741 --> 08:46.613
NOT UP
FOR DISCUSSION.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.092
ABBY: I SAW HER PICTURE.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.314
WHO IS SHE?

08:52.357 --> 08:53.881
IT'S A LONG STORY.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.578
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE TO FOCUS

08:55.622 --> 08:56.666
ON GETTING YOU
ON YOUR FEET

08:56.710 --> 08:57.885
SO YOU CAN OPERATE.

08:57.928 --> 09:01.628
NO. THOSE PEOPLE.
MCCREARY--

09:01.671 --> 09:03.847
IS A MURDER
AND A SOCIOPATH

09:03.891 --> 09:06.284
WHO HAPPENS TO NEED
THE SAME THING WE DO.

09:07.459 --> 09:08.983
TO STOP OCTAVIA.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.593
HE THREATENED TO KILL US,
DIDN'T HE?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.337
YES.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.819
I DON'T LIKE THIS
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.473
BUT IF WE HELP HIM,
WE LIVE.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.953
HIS PEOPLE WIN THE WAR.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.476
WE WORRY ABOUT
THE REST LATER.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.002
MOM, YOUR
HEART RATE'S WEAK

09:28.045 --> 09:29.699
AND YOU'RE NOT
RETAINING FLUID.

09:29.743 --> 09:30.961
I'M WORRIED
IF YOU TAKE

09:31.005 --> 09:32.702
ANY MORE OF THESE
TO FUNCTION--

09:32.746 --> 09:33.834
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.967
MY SYSTEM'S
TOO COMPROMISED.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.665
THEN HOW DO WE DO THIS?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.710
A DETOX TAKES TOO LONG.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.582
YOU HAVE TO BE OPERATING
IN 24 HOURS.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.108
FIRST GET RID
OF THE PILLS.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.417
THEN I WANT YOU
TO GET MY BAG.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.549
IT'S UNDER THE BED.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.641
THERE'S A OPIATE
BLOCKER IN THE BAG.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
I USED TO GIVE THEM
IN THE BUNKER.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.123
TRAVITIROL.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.474
THAT'LL PUT ME
INTO RAPID DETOX.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.215
IF MY HEART STOPS,

10:07.258 --> 10:09.434
THERE'S ADRENALINE
IN THERE, TOO.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.348
MOM...

10:10.392 --> 10:12.873
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THE LAST TIME.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.309
LAST TIME?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.224
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

10:21.795 --> 10:23.057
TOO LONG.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.628
ADMINISTER WITH THE IV.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.499
20 CCS TO START.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.807
YOU NEED TO TIE ME
DOWN FIRST.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.114
WHY?

10:38.072 --> 10:39.987
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO HURT YOU.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.165
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, MOM?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.301
OCTAVIA: YOU SAID
WE HAD 5 YEARS.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
WE'VE ONLY BEEN
DOWN HERE FOR TWO.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.698
COOPER: I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF,

10:55.742 --> 10:58.048
SHORT OF ERADICATING
THE INFECTED PLANTS.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.442
FOR NOW, THE FUNGUS IS
CONTAINED TO THE SOYBEAN CROP,

11:00.485 --> 11:02.052
BUT IT WON'T BE FOR LONG.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.794
I'VE SALVAGED A FEW
OF THE HEALTHY PLANTS
TO USE FOR SEEDS--

11:04.838 --> 11:06.013
HOW LONG?

11:07.754 --> 11:11.018
ONE YEAR.
LESS WITH SOME LUCK.

11:11.061 --> 11:14.238
ONE YEAR.
WITHOUT A PROTEIN SOURCE.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.675
ABBY: WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THE ANSWER IS.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
IF WE DON'T
GET AT LEAST 10%

11:20.767 --> 11:22.638
OF OUR CALORIES
FROM PROTEIN,

11:22.682 --> 11:23.726
OVER THAT AMOUNT
OF TIME,

11:23.770 --> 11:25.119
WE'LL STARVE
TO DEATH.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.035
I'M SORRY, MARCUS,
BUT THAT'S A FACT.

11:28.078 --> 11:31.212
THERE IS ONLY ONE
POTENTIAL SOURCE.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.483
THE FIGHTING PITS.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.316
OCTAVIA: WILL IT BE ENOUGH?

11:50.361 --> 11:51.580
TO LAST A YEAR?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.757
ABBY: IT SHOULD BE
ONCE THE CRIME RATE

11:54.801 --> 11:56.237
STARTS TO RISE.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.022
AND IT WILL.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.764
ARE WE SERIOUSLY
TALKING ABOUT THIS?

12:01.808 --> 12:04.636
OCTAVIA: WHAT ELSE
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:04.680 --> 12:05.812
KANE.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.293
GIVE US ANOTHER SOLUTION.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.080
ABBY: THERE IS
NO OTHER SOLUTION.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.225
BELLAMY AND INDRA
WANT TO TALK.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S ABOUT, BUT

12:29.444 --> 12:30.619
WE DISARMED THEM.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.065
YOU'RE MARCHING US
INTO A MASSACRE.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.501
WE'LL SEE.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.590
ECHO RADIOED.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.244
YOUR ENEMY KNOWS
YOU'RE COMING.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.811
WE DON'T NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT THE MISSILES,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.205
BUT THEY'RE MOVING
THEIR WEAPONS
INTO POSITION.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.120
IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT SINCE THERE'S

12:53.163 --> 12:55.557
ONLY 3 REALISTIC WAYS
INTO THE VALLEY,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.820
THAT ALL 3 WILL BE
HEAVILY DEFENDED.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.431
ECHO'S SCOUTING NOW,
LOOKING FOR
THE BEST WAY IN.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.519
BUT SINCE
WE CAN'T GO BACK

13:01.563 --> 13:02.869
BECAUSE YOU BURNED
THE FARM,

13:02.912 --> 13:05.306
AND SINCE WE CAN'T STOP
BECAUSE WE'LL STARVE,

13:05.349 --> 13:06.394
WE THOUGHT WE
SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

13:06.437 --> 13:07.917
THAT YOU'VE KILLED
YOUR PEOPLE.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.049
BELLAMY...

13:09.092 --> 13:10.572
ENJOY YOUR WALK.

13:31.593 --> 13:35.118
MAN: DROP THE OTHER BOARDS
RIGHT THERE.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.864
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.997
PILLBOX.
GUNNER POSITION.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.651
THEY'RE BUILDING
THEM ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE RAVINE.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.957
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A SPY TO KNOW

13:48.001 --> 13:49.698
THIS ISN'T
THE BEST WAY IN.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.092
IT'S TOO HIGH UP,
IT'S TOO FREAKING COLD,

13:52.135 --> 13:54.877
AND THEY'LL SEE THEM
COMING FOR MILES.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.009
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.401
HOLD ON.
NOT SO FAST.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.708
MURPHY,
WE'RE SCOUTING,
NOT STEALING.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.057
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.363
YOU ALREADY
HAVE A GUN.

14:04.104 --> 14:07.759
MURPHY: WELL, HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.
GUNS. LOOK.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.112
THE BOX NEXT TO IT
IS AMMUNITION.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.678
WELL, I MEAN,
THEY CAN'T
SHOOT US

14:13.722 --> 14:14.984
WITH WHAT THEY
DON'T HAVE.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.425
FOLLOW ME.

14:48.931 --> 14:49.845
DROP THE GUN.

14:51.064 --> 14:56.373
RIGHT NOW.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.027
LOOK, YOU SHOOT ME,
SHE SHOOTS YOU.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.334
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GO AHEAD AND PRETEND

15:00.377 --> 15:01.988
THIS THING
NEVER HAPPENED?

15:02.031 --> 15:05.382
]

15:05.426 --> 15:07.123
MAN: I GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.561
SHE DROPS
HER WEAPON,

15:10.605 --> 15:13.521
OR WE TURN YOUR
PRETTY FRIENDS
INTO PINK MIST.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.488
MAN:
RADIO MCCREARY.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.664
TELL HIM WE GOT
THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK SHAW.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.538
SHAW: NOW, THAT

15:30.581 --> 15:31.800
WOULD BE A BIG WIN.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.410
RAVEN: SHAW, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.543
I TELL YOU WHAT.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.633
LET THEM GO,
TAKE ME,

15:38.676 --> 15:40.200
MCCREARY
GETS HIS PILOT,

15:40.243 --> 15:41.244
FIRES HIS MISSILES,

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
YOU GUYS GET
TO BE HEROES.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.471
I'LL TIE HIM UP.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.820
KILL THE OTHERS.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.273
NICE THROW.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.709
THANKS.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.152
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:25.723 --> 16:26.420
HEY, JOHN,

16:26.463 --> 16:28.204
YOU STILL WANT A GUN?

16:28.248 --> 16:29.684
OH, HELL, YEAH.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.558
YOU CAN STAY.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.400
KANE: I TOLD YOU
TO LIE DOWN.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.880
DIYOZA:
THE BABY'S FINE.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.756
HE NEEDS
A REAL DOCTOR.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.325
SO DO YOU.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.379
IT'S OK, KANE.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.163
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT ABBY, TOO.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.905
WHEN MCCREARY
CAME FOR US,

17:16.948 --> 17:19.081
SHE PUT HERSELF
BETWEEN A BULLET
AND MY CHILD

17:19.125 --> 17:20.082
WITHOUT EVEN
BLINKING.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.650
SHE'S A BRAVE WOMAN.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.483
OPIATES ARE A BITCH.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.877
BACK IN THE SERVICE
A MILLION YEARS AGO,

17:32.921 --> 17:34.836
I LOST MORE MEN
TO PILLS THAN WAR.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.409
SO, WHAT ABOUT
THIS WAR?

17:51.331 --> 17:54.116
HIGH CASUALTIES.
BOTH SIDES.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.640
WONKRU WILL SUFFER
LOSSES AT THE BORDER,

17:56.684 --> 17:58.207
BUT ONCE THEY GET IN,

17:58.251 --> 18:01.080
WITH THEIR
NUMBERS ADVANTAGE
AND TRAINING...

18:02.429 --> 18:06.128
THE RED QUEEN
WILL REIGN OVER

18:06.172 --> 18:07.869
THE GREEN VALLEY.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.263
THE ONLY QUESTION IS
HOW MUCH OF IT'S LEFT

18:10.306 --> 18:11.481
WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPS.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.225
I MEAN,
WHO KNOWS, KANE?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.272
MAYBE SHE'LL
FORGIVE YOU AND ABBY

18:19.315 --> 18:20.534
FOR DEFECTION
AND TREASON

18:20.577 --> 18:22.057
INSTEAD OF SLAUGHTERING
US ALL,

18:22.101 --> 18:25.930
AND WE CAN ALL LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.368
OCTAVIA LOST HER WAY
TO HAPPILY EVER AFTER

18:28.411 --> 18:29.412
A LONG TIME AGO.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.331
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE BETWEEN

18:35.375 --> 18:36.767
A MONSTER AND THE DEVIL?

18:39.292 --> 18:41.076
AAH!

18:41.120 --> 18:44.166
AAH! AAH! AAH!

18:44.210 --> 18:47.082
JUST STOP.
IT'S TOO MUCH.
IT'S TOO MUCH.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.344
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.737
MY BODY CAN'T
HANDLE THIS.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.739
-YES, IT CAN.
-OH. OOH.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.566
MADI.

18:52.609 --> 18:53.958
HEY, LEAVE HER
OUT OF THIS.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.830
PLEASE TRUST ME.
I KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.048
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.224
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH THIS.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.355
DO YOU SEE WHAT
SHE'S DOING?

18:59.399 --> 19:00.443
SHE'S ACTING
LIKE SHE CAN MAKE

19:00.487 --> 19:01.923
THE DECISION FOR YOU.

19:01.966 --> 19:07.407
SHE DECIDES WHO LIVES
AND WHO DIES.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.192
DON'T YOU LET HER
DECIDE FOR ME.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.063
NOT FOR ME.
IF I DIE,

19:12.107 --> 19:14.501
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
FORGIVE YOURSELF.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.980
MADI: YOU CHOSE THIS.

19:17.591 --> 19:18.766
NOT CLARKE.

19:21.116 --> 19:24.598
SHE TOLD ME HER MOTHER
WAS KIND, LOVING.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.295
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.693
CLARKE: NO, MOM.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.738
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT DID I DO?

19:34.782 --> 19:36.000
CLARKE: IT WASN'T YOU.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.654
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO HER?

19:37.698 --> 19:39.003
HER HEART STOPPED.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.702
PLEASE WORK.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.335
THEY NEED
TO SEE US DO THIS.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.779
WE ALL KNOW THE SITUATION.

20:18.042 --> 20:21.742
WHAT WE DO HERE NOW,
WE DO TO SURVIVE.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.570
SOME OF YOU THINK IT'S A SIN.

20:24.962 --> 20:28.357
BUT THE SIN WOULD BE LETTING
OURSELVES STARVE TO DEATH

20:28.401 --> 20:29.315
WHEN WE KNOW...

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
WE'RE ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.337
COOPER: WASH IT DOWN
WITH THE VEGETABLE BROTH.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.555
IT'LL MAKE IT
EASIER.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.127
MILLER: ONE YEAR.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.085
NIYLAH: I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.001
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
THE FIGHTING PITS.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.133
THEIR FACES.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.181
THEY DIED SO
WE CAN LIVE.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.272
HONOR THEM.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.839
DON'T LET THEIR
SACRIFICE GO TO WASTE.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.372
MMF.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.990
I CAN'T.

21:39.559 --> 21:43.214
I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT WE HAVE TO DO--

21:43.258 --> 21:44.390
I SAID NO.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.619
WE ALL NEED TO MAKE
THIS CHOICE

21:56.663 --> 21:58.012
FOR OURSELVES.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.189
ABBY: THERE IS
NO CHOICE.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.803
IF YOU DON'T EAT,
YOU STARVE.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.979
THERE'S ALWAYS
A CHOICE, ABBY.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.939
YOU KNOW THAT.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.087
CLARKE: MOM?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.264
MOM.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.989
YOU SAVED
HER LIFE.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.776
ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA SAVE THEIRS?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.608
I'M TIRED, MADI.

23:12.652 --> 23:15.394
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.873
I LOVE YOU, CLARKE,

23:16.917 --> 23:19.485
BUT WE'RE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THIS WAR.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.579
MAYBE.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.232
BUT YOU GET TO LIVE.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.761
LIVING WITH OURSELVES
IS ANOTHER STORY.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.514
ECHO: THEY'RE DIGGING IN
AT ALL 3 NORTHERN ENTRY POINTS.

23:48.557 --> 23:52.126
DRY TRIBUTARIES
HERE, HERE, AND HERE.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.910
EACH POSITION HAS TWO PILLBOXES

23:53.954 --> 23:55.695
ON EITHER SIDE
OF THE ENTRY POINT

23:55.738 --> 23:57.784
WITH GUNNERS EVENLY DIVIDED.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.394
DIYOZA:
SON OF A BITCH.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.136
HE'S USING
MY PLAYBOOK.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.182
TWO GUNNER POSITIONS
AT EACH ENTRY POINT.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.141
MY BATTLE PLAN
CALLED FOR THE USE

24:07.184 --> 24:09.404
OF ELIGIUS
BLAST SHELTERS.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.624
I DROPPED
MY NOTEBOOK
AT THE GAS STATION.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.886
MCCREARY MUST HAVE
FOUND IT.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.628
HOW DETAILED?

24:15.671 --> 24:20.110
DEPLOYMENT FORMATIONS.
WEAPONS DISTRIBUTIONS.

24:20.154 --> 24:23.549
FIRST STRIKE OPTIONS.
COUNTERMOVES.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.293
AND I THINK OF EVERYTHING.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.512
MURPHY: OK.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.557
SO, IS THERE A SAFE WAY

24:31.600 --> 24:32.514
TO GET IN OR NOT?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.570
OCTAVIA: WE'RE GONNA
TAKE HEAVY FIRE,

24:44.613 --> 24:46.572
BUT AS LONG
AS WE STAY TOGETHER,

24:46.615 --> 24:47.703
WE CAN STILL DO THIS.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.357
DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.054
BELLAMY: WE NEED
TO SEE HER NOW.

24:51.881 --> 24:53.143
LET HIM IN!

24:54.362 --> 24:56.843
YOU DON'T
NEED THAT.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.324
THE SPY FOUND US
A WAY IN?

25:00.368 --> 25:01.456
YES.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.635
EVERYBODY OUT.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.123
BEFORE I TELL YOU THIS,

25:16.166 --> 25:17.907
WE NEED TO SET
SOME THINGS STRAIGHT.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.302
I'M LISTENING.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.086
THIS WAR THAT YOU'RE
SO ANXIOUS FOR

25:23.130 --> 25:24.392
IS ABOUT
TO BE FOUGHT

25:24.435 --> 25:26.568
ON THE LAST
SURVIVABLE LAND
ON EARTH.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.353
THAT IS
MONUMENTALLY STUPID.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.442
BUT IT'S HERE,
AND IN 4 DAYS,

25:31.486 --> 25:32.879
WHEN WE MARCH
ON THAT VALLEY,

25:32.922 --> 25:35.316
WE ARE GONNA FIGHT THIS
THE RIGHT WAY.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.885
DOES THE RIGHT WAY

25:38.928 --> 25:40.626
END UP WITH US WINNING?

25:40.669 --> 25:41.844
IT ENDS WITH US

25:41.888 --> 25:43.890
ACCEPTING THE OTHER
SIDE'S SURRENDER.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.369
ONCE THEY LAY DOWN
THEIR ARMS,

25:45.413 --> 25:47.502
WE SHARE THE VALLEY
WITH THEM.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.635
NO EXECUTIONS.
NO FIGHTING PITS.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.375
REAL PEACE.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.422
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I WANT THAT, TOO.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.120
I WISH I BELIEVED IT.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.562
FINE. I ACCEPT
YOUR TERMS.

26:04.954 --> 26:06.739
NOW, TELL ME HOW
TO WIN THIS WAR.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.614
INDRA HAS THE DETAILS.

26:12.658 --> 26:13.963
BELLAMY...

26:14.921 --> 26:17.619
THIS IS HOW
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.751
YOU AND ME.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.884
FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.062
I'M NOT FIGHTING
FOR YOU.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.021
I'M FIGHTING TO GET
BACK TO MY FAMILY.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.560
ABBY: I ALWAYS LOVED
WATCHING YOU SLEEP.

26:50.652 --> 26:51.871
I KNOW THE FEELING.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.232
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

27:13.066 --> 27:17.026
I STARTED TAKING
THE PILLS AFTER ALIE.

27:17.070 --> 27:20.682
RAVEN'S ICE BATH
WORKED ON MY BRAIN.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.772
MOM...YOU DON'T
NEED TO EXPLAIN.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.688
YES, I DO.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.257
WE DID THINGS
TO SURVIVE.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.696
THINGS NO HUMAN BEING

27:34.740 --> 27:35.915
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO DO.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.750
NO WAY.
I WON'T TAKE AWAY
THEIR CHOICE.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.534
WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY
ENOUGH, THEY'LL EAT.

27:46.577 --> 27:49.493
LISTEN TO ME.
NOBODY WANTS TO DO THIS.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.844
BUT WE CAN'T
LET THEM STARVE.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.106
IF THEY DIE
FROM MALNUTRITION,

27:53.149 --> 27:54.716
THEIR MUSCLES
WILL ATROPHY,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.544
AND THERE WON'T
BE ENOUGH MEAT
ON THEIR BONES.

27:56.587 --> 27:59.678
-I CAN'T HEAR THIS.
-YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.941
ON THE ARK,
THE BLIGHT
GENERATION,

28:01.984 --> 28:03.464
THEY HAD A CHOICE,

28:03.507 --> 28:05.379
AND THEY NEVER
RECOVERED FROM IT.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.728
THE PEOPLE WHO ATE
HAD TO WATCH

28:06.772 --> 28:09.644
THE PEOPLE WHO
DIDN'T EAT DIE SLOWLY,

28:09.688 --> 28:13.169
AND THEIR GUILT...
NEARLY DESTROYED THEM.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.693
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

28:16.564 --> 28:19.306
MAKE IT A CRIME
NOT TO BE A CANNIBAL?

28:27.575 --> 28:30.360
OHH...

28:30.404 --> 28:33.450
THAT'S ONE WAY
TO FILL THE FREEZER.

28:38.542 --> 28:42.677
FIRST WE GET...
FULL COMPLIANCE.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.898
AND THEN WE DEAL
WITH SUPPLY.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.334
SUPPLY.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.990
THESE ARE MY PEOPLE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.862
I KNOW THAT.
THEY'RE MINE, TOO.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.952
THEN I SUPPOSE
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE

28:56.996 --> 28:58.258
AN EXCEPTION FOR KANE.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.478
NO.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.832
MARCUS IS THE KEY.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.356
YOU CONVINCE HIM...

29:09.399 --> 29:11.880
AND THE REST WILL FOLLOW.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.722
WHAT'S WITH
THE GUNS?

29:35.991 --> 29:39.081
WE HONOR
THOSE WHO DIED...

29:39.125 --> 29:41.257
SO WE COULD LIVE.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.216
I GIVE ALL OF MYSELF TO YOU.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.873
YOU KNOW THAT.
AND SO DID THEY.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.715
MAN, WHISPERING:
I CAN'T DO THIS AT ALL.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.312
EAT.

30:38.227 --> 30:41.709
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.235
MAYBE I WASN'T
BEING CLEAR.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.414
THIS ISN'T
A CHOICE.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.070
FOR ME IT IS.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.898
ONE OF THE MEN
IN THE ARENA YESTERDAY

30:56.942 --> 30:57.856
WAS MY BROTHER.

31:08.649 --> 31:13.045
AND HE GAVE HIS LIFE
SO YOU COULD LIVE.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.482
SO WE ALL COULD.

31:20.139 --> 31:23.620
ALL OF HIM
FOR ALL OF US.

31:38.418 --> 31:41.203
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT...

31:41.247 --> 31:44.032
BUT I WOULD RATHER
DIE WITH MY BROTHER THAN--

31:47.209 --> 31:50.343
OCTAVIA...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.914
YOU ARE WONKRU...

31:57.611 --> 31:59.700
OR YOU ARE AN ENEMY
OF WONKRU.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.095
CHOOSE.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.444
KANE: OCTAVIA...

32:05.619 --> 32:07.142
PUT THE GUN DOWN. PLEASE.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.078
YOU EAT, OR YOU DIE.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.558
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.342
OCTAVIA, THIS
ISN'T YOU.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.083
PLEASE, PUT DOWN
THE GUN.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.955
JUST TAKE A BITE.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.741
DO IT.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.361
YOU EAT, OR YOU DIE.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.624
KANE: OCTAVIA, PLEASE.

33:03.503 --> 33:06.158
-EAT OR DIE.
-NO, STOP, SHE'LL EAT.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.376
ENOUGH! ENOUGH.

33:09.900 --> 33:10.989
I'LL EAT.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.420
IT WAS ME.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.605
IT WAS ME.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.091
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR MIND?

34:53.134 --> 34:54.222
ARE YOU?

34:54.266 --> 34:56.355
ONE DEATH AND THIS
WAR IS OVER.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.660
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.359
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE ON HIS SIDE.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.187
HOW CAN YOU STILL
BE AGAINST OCTAVIA

35:02.230 --> 35:03.884
AFTER WHAT
YOUR MOM SAID

35:03.927 --> 35:04.928
WENT ON DOWN THERE?

35:07.192 --> 35:09.237
SHE MURDERED
HER OWN PEOPLE

35:09.281 --> 35:10.891
TO BREAK THEIR WILL.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.112
I KNOW THAT.
AS AWFUL AS IT WAS,

35:14.155 --> 35:18.464
TAKING AWAY THEIR CHOICE,
PUTTING IT ALL ON HER,

35:18.507 --> 35:23.338
SHE BORE IT SO THAT
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO,

35:23.382 --> 35:25.123
JUST LIKE YOU
AT MOUNT WEATHER.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.737
I NEVER TOLD YOU
THAT STORY.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.956
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
A LOT OF THINGS.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.352
BELLAMY, RAVEN,
OCTAVIA, EVEN MURPHY.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.485
THEY WERE ALWAYS
THE HEROES.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.403
WHEN ALL ALONG,
IT WAS YOU.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.538
UNTIL NOW.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.063
I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.289
YOU LISTEN HERE.
THE THINGS I DID,

36:01.333 --> 36:04.423
I DID FOR MY PEOPLE.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.511
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

36:09.558 --> 36:12.387
NOW YOU'RE MY PEOPLE.

36:12.431 --> 36:15.956
ABBY: CLARKE...
I NEED YOUR HELP.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.218
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.572
I NEVER SAID I WAS
A HERO, MADI...

36:25.444 --> 36:26.836
BECAUSE I'M NOT ONE.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.532
MONTY:  BELLAMY.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.026
LAST OF THE RATIONS.

37:34.034 --> 37:38.256
LOOK...IF YOU WANT US
WITH YOU AT THE FRONT--

37:38.299 --> 37:42.216
NO. WE GOT THIS.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.524
YOU STAY.
THEY'RE LEAVING
THE TENTS HERE.

37:46.525 --> 37:49.397
ONCE THE FIGHT
IS OVER TOMORROW,
YOU'LL COME AND JOIN US.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.316
I TOLD OCTAVIA
WE'RE TAKING 80 ACRES,

37:55.360 --> 37:56.665
EASTERN EDGE
OF THE VALLEY.

37:58.667 --> 38:02.062
GROW SOMETHING
OTHER THAN ALGAE. OK?

38:11.376 --> 38:12.594
MILLER: EVERYBODY AMMO UP.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.340
-YEAH, THAT WORKS FOR ME.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.950
MILLER: ONCE THE SHOOTING
STARTS, IT'LL TAKE

38:20.994 --> 38:23.039
10 MINUTES FOR MCCREARY'S
REINFORCEMENTS TO ARRIVE,

38:23.083 --> 38:24.954
SO, DON'T USE ALL YOUR BULLETS
BEFORE THEN.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.311
IT'S BEEN 4 DAYS.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.877
WE'RE ABOUT TO GO
TO WAR, AND MAYBE
YOU SHOULD

38:34.921 --> 38:36.705
FORGIVE ME FOR
SAVING YOUR LIFE.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.373
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

38:54.636 --> 38:57.378
I'M MAD AT YOU
FOR MAKING ME CARE
ABOUT YOURS.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.122
UNDERSTAND?

39:21.315 --> 39:22.751
YOU'LL BE
TOGETHER SOON.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.672
IT'S ALMOST DAWN.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.805
LET'S GO OVER
THIS AGAIN.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.416
WHEN I GIVE THE SIGNAL,
WE OPEN FIRE
ON PILLBOX ONE,

39:35.460 --> 39:36.417
IN POSITION A HERE.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.332
ACCORDING TO DIYOZA,

39:38.376 --> 39:39.594
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF ATTACK...
BELLAMY: AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF ATTACK,

39:39.638 --> 39:41.683
MCCREARY'S FORCES
AT POINT B AND C

39:41.727 --> 39:43.032
WILL CONVERGE TO REINFORCE A,

39:43.076 --> 39:44.643
THINKING THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE COMING THROUGH.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.471
OCTAVIA: LEAVING
THE OTHER TWO DOORS
WIDE OPEN.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.211
WE'LL COME THROUGH HERE.
POINT C.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.909
NOW, IF WE
TIME IT RIGHT
AND WE MOVE FAST,

39:49.952 --> 39:51.345
THERE WON'T BE
ANY RESISTANCE.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.869
ONCE WE'RE IN THE WOODS,
WE TAKE THE VILLAGE.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.871
ONCE WE'RE
IN THE WOODS, WE WIN.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.657
OK. I'LL TELL
MY PEOPLE.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.658
YOUR PEOPLE?

39:59.701 --> 40:01.311
INDRA: SAVE IT FOR THE ENEMY.

40:02.617 --> 40:03.575
SPREAD THE WORD.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.228
WE GO AT FIRST LIGHT.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.496
TELL ECHO I SAID
WELL DONE.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.499
YOU CAN
TELL HER YOURSELF

40:14.542 --> 40:15.500
IN TWO HOURS.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.768
IT'LL ALL
BE WORTH IT.

40:24.813 --> 40:27.033
ONCE WE'RE
IN THE VALLEY,

40:27.076 --> 40:29.557
EVERYTHING WE HAD
TO DO TO GET THERE...

40:31.385 --> 40:33.518
IT'LL MAKE SENSE.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.345
YOU'LL SEE.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.738
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.790
I HAVE TO BE.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.727
-FINE.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.163
-GOOD.

41:11.338 --> 41:12.470
FINE.

41:15.734 --> 41:16.909
YOU HAVE TWO SECONDS
TO TELL ME

41:16.952 --> 41:18.650
WHY YOU'RE TURNING
YOURSELVES IN.

41:18.693 --> 41:20.695
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

41:20.739 --> 41:23.176
WONKRU KNOW YOU HAVE
MY BATTLE PLANS.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.612
THEY KNOW EVERY MOVE
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE

41:24.656 --> 41:25.961
BEFORE YOU MAKE IT.

41:26.005 --> 41:28.007
KANE: IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THIS WAR.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.574
OR YOU CAN GET
THOSE GUNS OFF US

41:29.617 --> 41:30.618
AND WE'LL TELL YOU
HOW TO WIN IT.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.491
AND WHY WOULD YOU
TELL ME THAT?

41:35.362 --> 41:37.712
BECAUSE I WON'T LET
THE DEVIL IN THIS GARDEN.
