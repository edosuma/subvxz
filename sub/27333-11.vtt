MOLLY:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.937 --> 00:12.859
FEMALE VOICE:
Karolina...

00:12.943 --> 00:15.531
I've been searching for you...

00:15.615 --> 00:16.951
KAROLINA: Hello?

00:17.034 --> 00:18.370
DALE:
What are you doing in here?

00:18.453 --> 00:19.497
STACY:
Trying to find our kids.

00:19.581 --> 00:21.376
We're under attack,
and we have to fight back.

00:21.459 --> 00:23.673
Sweetie, that's so not you.

00:23.756 --> 00:25.175
Or it's exactly me.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.306
-Tina?
-No. Victor?

00:28.390 --> 00:29.559
No.

00:32.732 --> 00:33.818
Chase?

00:33.901 --> 00:37.241
We are so happy you came home,
honey. How you feeling?

00:37.324 --> 00:38.869
-If we want to save Gert--
-Then we need to give

00:38.953 --> 00:41.207
-Old Lace the antidote.
-Dale.

00:43.504 --> 00:44.590
You saved us.

00:45.465 --> 00:46.760
Now how do we get out of here?

00:46.844 --> 00:48.931
It's AWOL.
How did he find us?

00:49.015 --> 00:50.225
I'm so sorry.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.733
NICO:
I can feel it clawing at me!

00:53.816 --> 00:57.031
It's trying to rip through my skin.

00:57.866 --> 00:59.243
(screams)

00:59.327 --> 01:00.705
You guys! Nico's losing it!

01:01.372 --> 01:03.209
(whoosh)

01:03.293 --> 01:04.921
AWOL:
Move, move, move!

01:11.351 --> 01:14.983
Get...out!

01:17.906 --> 01:19.200
A reconditioning?

01:21.622 --> 01:24.335
FRANK:
Please. Sit down, Leslie.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.089
Please go to hell, Frank.

01:38.154 --> 01:40.409
WOMAN:
Ma'am, are you hungry?

01:40.492 --> 01:41.995
Take this.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.880
It's OK. It's for you.

02:32.889 --> 02:34.225
Oh, shut up.

02:34.308 --> 02:36.980
Let the Light enter you, Leslie.

02:37.816 --> 02:39.653
Let it cleanse away the resistance.

02:40.696 --> 02:43.994
Yeah, can you do that line again?
I'm still not really feelin' it.

02:44.078 --> 02:46.875
This plan you have to close the church,
it's just wrong.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.631
The church is pretend, Frank.
That's why you like it so much.

02:54.891 --> 02:56.603
(electronic beeping)

02:57.897 --> 02:58.899
I am not going to let you

02:58.983 --> 03:01.112
- ruin our life's work.
-(Leslie chuckles)

03:01.195 --> 03:04.368
"Let" me? You can't stop me.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.874
Besides, you didn't actually
do any work, did you, Frank?

03:08.544 --> 03:11.508
I can stop you, Leslie.
I told you I would send you--

03:11.592 --> 03:13.971
Send me to the Crater?
Fine. Then do it.

03:14.764 --> 03:16.350
This is not what I wanted.

03:18.187 --> 03:19.608
Take her to the van.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.489
(Old Lace growls)

03:24.826 --> 03:26.663
Old Lace, we're trying.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.128
Do you think anyone will come for us?

03:30.211 --> 03:31.590
They should check here eventually.

03:33.384 --> 03:35.138
That's if the Strike Team didn't get 'em.

03:35.221 --> 03:37.518
(door opens)

03:37.602 --> 03:39.814
-STACEY: Here you go.
-DALE: Buenos dias.

03:39.898 --> 03:41.943
STACEY: For your first morning back
I made your favorite--

03:42.027 --> 03:43.864
blueberry pecan pancakes.

03:45.075 --> 03:46.578
I'm not back.

03:46.662 --> 03:50.335
And I even had your mom
buy those little vegan sausages

03:50.418 --> 03:53.049
that taste like cardboard,
but I love 'em, and so do you,

03:53.132 --> 03:54.218
so you're welcome, I love you.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.725
Don't gaslight me.

03:57.809 --> 04:00.188
You poisoned us
and then you kidnapped us.

04:00.271 --> 04:02.652
And you're going along with it,
which makes you just as guilty!

04:02.735 --> 04:04.405
Now, Muffin...

04:06.075 --> 04:08.371
your mother and I feel like
this whole running-away thing

04:08.454 --> 04:10.125
has gone on long enough.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.339
And Chase, I know your parents
feel the same way.

04:14.049 --> 04:15.594
I almost died!

04:15.678 --> 04:17.974
Honey, I just wanted you home so badly
I was willing to do anything.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.769
Gert, I mean, she's your mom.

04:22.859 --> 04:25.531
Chase, no, don't drink that!
That's probably poison!

04:26.742 --> 04:27.827
(thud)

04:29.873 --> 04:32.335
(theme music playing)

05:40.931 --> 05:43.227
(lighter clicking)

05:48.237 --> 05:49.782
(continues clicking)

05:53.039 --> 05:54.499
Come on, light.

05:57.214 --> 06:00.763
-ALEX: Hey, What are you doing?
-Nothing! I-- I'm just--

06:01.973 --> 06:04.729
-Did you find Gert and Chase?
-Not in the hospital databases.

06:04.812 --> 06:06.858
I was gonna hack into Urgent Cares next,
but that could take all day.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.319
We don't have all day.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.200
-What were you doing in here just now?
-I said nothing.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.538
-(object clatters)
-(Molly sighs)

06:13.622 --> 06:15.709
ALEX: I hope that wasn't
one of AWOL's grenades.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.928
Whoa, Molly.
A little SnoBall's nothing to hide.

06:24.644 --> 06:26.355
Is that a birthday candle?

06:26.438 --> 06:28.276
It was my birthday yesterday. So?

06:28.359 --> 06:31.407
What?! Molly! Happy birthday!

06:31.490 --> 06:32.952
What are you, fifteen now?

06:33.035 --> 06:35.039
Damn, girl, you're gettin' old.

06:35.123 --> 06:37.586
Alex, no, it's over. We missed it.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.008
Because we were trying
not to get killed.

06:40.091 --> 06:41.678
Let me sing you the birthday song.

06:41.761 --> 06:43.222
-I suck at it, but still.
-MOLLY: Forget it.

06:43.306 --> 06:44.934
It's not like I need a quince
or anything.

06:45.018 --> 06:45.894
What?

06:47.272 --> 06:48.900
A quinceañera?

06:48.984 --> 06:51.614
It's what girls in Latin culture do
for their fifteenth.

06:51.698 --> 06:55.581
But...it's way too old-fashioned for me.

06:55.664 --> 06:57.417
Besides, you need a family, and...

06:57.501 --> 06:58.628
I don't want to do it without Gert.

06:58.712 --> 07:01.760
Family. That's it.
Chase was the one driving.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.764
So where would he take
a sick dinosaur?

07:03.847 --> 07:06.268
Really just two places.
His parents or yours.

07:06.351 --> 07:08.899
And only one of those places
would know what to do with Old Lace.

07:10.652 --> 07:13.074
But do you really think that
he would risk going to our parents?

07:14.284 --> 07:16.288
There's one way to find out.
Come on.

07:23.427 --> 07:24.722
(thud)

07:25.974 --> 07:28.187
Hmm. Leave me alone.

07:30.024 --> 07:31.443
KAROLINA:
I brought you some--

07:32.613 --> 07:34.491
I figured that maybe you were--

07:36.788 --> 07:39.000
-Do you need anything?
-NICO: I'm fine.

07:40.546 --> 07:41.965
Are you sure?

07:42.716 --> 07:44.595
NICO:
Please just go.

07:56.578 --> 07:58.330
FEMALE VOICE:
Karolina.

07:58.832 --> 07:59.959
Wait.

08:01.963 --> 08:03.132
Hello?

08:04.009 --> 08:05.596
Karolina.

08:07.432 --> 08:08.727
Who are you?

08:09.896 --> 08:12.358
Hey. We think we know
where to find Gert and Chase.

08:12.442 --> 08:15.657
-MOLLY: Let's get Nico. Come on.
-KAROLINA: No. Nico's way too sick.

08:15.741 --> 08:17.160
But-- but I'm in.

08:17.243 --> 08:18.830
-OK.
-OK.

08:18.914 --> 08:21.544
ALEX: Let's see how long it'll take
to get a car up here.

09:22.123 --> 09:23.835
LESLIE:
The Church of Gibborim is a lie!

09:23.918 --> 09:26.131
-DEVOTEES: May the light shine upon you.
-LESLIE: Please, listen to me.

09:26.214 --> 09:30.306
Don't bow to me. No,
Everything you're saying is bullshit.

09:30.389 --> 09:33.270
David Ellerh made the whole thing up.
It's all a lie!

09:33.354 --> 09:35.817
Everything you believe is bullshit!

09:35.901 --> 09:38.489
Everything you believe is a lie!

09:38.531 --> 09:39.783
[muffled] Lie.

09:39.825 --> 09:41.453
It's all a lie!

09:43.332 --> 09:44.794
WOMAN:
Welcome home.

09:45.504 --> 09:48.300
I'm S4E2R.
I see you and I love you.

09:48.384 --> 09:50.597
Oh, keep it.

09:50.681 --> 09:53.018
This is my church.
You know that, right?

09:54.980 --> 09:56.609
Do you have any water?

09:56.693 --> 09:58.905
What happened to your bracelet?

09:58.988 --> 10:01.076
It's a good thing
I have a new one for you.

10:05.251 --> 10:08.758
And of course...
here's your contract.

10:10.094 --> 10:10.929
(Leslie chuckles)

10:11.012 --> 10:14.185
You want me to voluntarily submit
to indoctrination

10:14.269 --> 10:16.273
for an undetermined length of time?

10:16.356 --> 10:17.735
Yeah, I'll never sign that.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.743
Tell me why you think
your family sent you here.

10:21.826 --> 10:25.876
Hmm. My husband, the actor,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.506
has just discovered that running a church
is the role of a lifetime,

10:28.590 --> 10:29.717
and he wants me out of the way.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.138
That's why my family has sent me here.

10:32.221 --> 10:34.350
I haven't slept all night,
so if you could just give me

10:34.434 --> 10:37.190
my confirmation number,
we could move on, that'd be great.

10:37.273 --> 10:42.366
Going forward, you must never
use anyone's name. A name is--

10:42.450 --> 10:44.663
Project of the ego. Yeah. Got it.

10:45.624 --> 10:50.216
From now on,
you will go by L3D5E.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.846
Would you like to repeat that back to me?

10:54.224 --> 10:55.100
(short laugh)

10:58.023 --> 11:00.361
My name...

11:00.444 --> 11:02.658
is Leslie Ellerh Dean, bitch.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.162
And I'll say it a hundred times.

11:05.246 --> 11:07.083
If I knew your name,
I'd say that too.

11:08.711 --> 11:12.511
Now give me a drink...
of water.

11:13.387 --> 11:14.932
(thud)

11:20.652 --> 11:23.282
It's not exactly
like you see in the movies, Stace.

11:23.365 --> 11:26.914
Sodium thiopental doesn't force you
to tell the truth

11:26.998 --> 11:29.879
so much as it makes lying
extremely difficult by...

11:29.962 --> 11:32.341
BOTH: ...suppressing higher
cortical function.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.220
Do you really think
that I don't know that?

11:34.304 --> 11:36.266
-I'm just curious.
-I don't know. Well, maybe not.

11:36.349 --> 11:38.897
Yes? Cut me some slack.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.692
Most people aren't aware

11:40.775 --> 11:44.490
that rapid onset barbiturates
are also short-acting.

11:44.575 --> 11:47.330
-Please, just find the vein.
-OK.

11:47.413 --> 11:49.125
I am. Here we go.

11:50.670 --> 11:54.678
You know, hon, I used to find
your condescension sort of adorable.

11:54.762 --> 11:57.517
-Oh. Thank you.
-But for some reason,

11:57.601 --> 11:59.688
you're bugging the shit out of me lately.

12:00.607 --> 12:02.360
So sorry, Stace, I'll work on that.

12:02.443 --> 12:03.696
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.117
-Oh! Here he comes.
-Oh.

12:06.201 --> 12:08.038
-(Dale clears throat)
-STACEY: All right.

12:08.121 --> 12:10.334
We only have a few minutes.
So, let's make it count.
DALE: Let's make it count.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.591
-Hi. Chase.
-Hi, hello! Chase!

12:13.675 --> 12:14.885
Good morning.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.975
Hi, Gert's parents.

12:18.058 --> 12:20.437
-That's right. Stacey and Dale.
-Hi.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.987
Uh...I'm having a dream,

12:24.070 --> 12:25.615
and you're in it right now.

12:25.699 --> 12:27.243
-This isn't a dream, sweetheart.
-No, it's not a dream.

12:27.326 --> 12:28.997
-STACEY: We need you to tell us
-DALE: It's real life.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.209
-where you and Gert have been living.
-That's all.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.298
Oh. (laughs)

12:34.382 --> 12:39.017
I know what you want. You guys
want me to tell you stuff. Secrets.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.729
Secrets. Shh!

12:40.812 --> 12:43.275
I can't do that.

12:44.235 --> 12:47.909
OK. Uh, Chase. Chase.
Look at me. It's Dale.

12:47.993 --> 12:51.584
-Hey, Dale. I can't do that, Dale.
-DALE: I know, I know.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.420
Now listen...

12:53.504 --> 12:55.759
we love Gert and Molly very much.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.637
I love Gert too.

12:57.721 --> 13:00.852
I love Gert so much...

13:00.935 --> 13:02.606
that I'm afraid to tell her.

13:02.689 --> 13:04.693
-And Molly...
-Yeah?

13:05.486 --> 13:07.239
Molly? Molly I'm cool with.

13:07.323 --> 13:09.536
Actually I love Molly.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.999
But it's a different kind of love
because she--

13:12.083 --> 13:15.005
Shut up, Chase.
Tell us where you kids are living. Now.

13:16.382 --> 13:19.013
-You're scaring me.
-You're not alone.

13:19.097 --> 13:20.725
(doorbell rings)

13:20.809 --> 13:23.063
-Who's that? Get rid of them.
-I don't know. OK.

13:23.146 --> 13:25.484
-Chase, I'll be right back.
-Bye, Dale.

13:25.568 --> 13:27.572
-CHASE: He's nice.
-It's Tina.

13:27.656 --> 13:30.160
-What the heck is she doing here?
-What do we do now?

13:30.244 --> 13:32.456
Keep talking. The window's gonna close.
But keep your voice down.

13:34.837 --> 13:36.256
Please leave. You're trespassing.

13:36.339 --> 13:38.468
Actually, I'm the Wizey alpha user.

13:38.553 --> 13:41.725
My voice controls all one billion units
currently in operation.

13:41.809 --> 13:43.688
I opened that door legally.

13:43.771 --> 13:46.276
PRIDE sent me to check on you two.

13:47.444 --> 13:50.409
So this is what you've been working on.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.831
Chase Stein and a hypodermic needle.

13:52.914 --> 13:58.383
Oh.
(sing-songy) You guys are in trouble.

14:13.706 --> 14:14.791
I'm looking for her.

14:16.754 --> 14:18.549
-Karolina.
-Karolina Dean?

14:18.633 --> 14:21.931
(laughs) You and everyone else.

14:22.014 --> 14:24.477
She is amazing.

14:25.270 --> 14:28.861
Can you show me something
she's touched so I can find her?

14:28.945 --> 14:31.575
VAUGHN: Your line of inquiry is--
it's very alarming.

14:31.659 --> 14:32.827
What's your name?

14:39.215 --> 14:40.885
She was right here.
Did you see her?

14:40.969 --> 14:42.096
She was--

14:43.683 --> 14:47.314
S4E2R:
Darkness is a misuse of the mind.

14:48.609 --> 14:51.657
An idea that only appears to be real.

14:52.575 --> 14:55.707
There is no truth, but Light.

14:57.126 --> 14:59.380
Darkness is a misuse--

14:59.463 --> 15:00.758
LESLIE:
Get away from me.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.639
S4E2R:
Are you ready to surrender yet?

15:03.723 --> 15:06.019
Nothing you say will ever
change my mind.

15:06.102 --> 15:09.651
Hmm. Surely you know
that's what everyone says.

15:09.735 --> 15:12.824
I'm not everyone.
I am the head of this church.

15:14.703 --> 15:18.334
You're a disappointment.
That's what you are.

15:19.796 --> 15:23.888
If David Ellerh could see you right now,
he would be disgusted.

15:24.931 --> 15:28.271
He was the kind of man
who believed.

15:28.354 --> 15:30.943
Deeply. Fearlessly.

15:40.630 --> 15:42.216
No.

15:42.299 --> 15:43.928
You don't know my father.

15:45.556 --> 15:47.894
He believed in the truth.

15:49.731 --> 15:53.614
He would want the church destroyed
if he knew what I've learned.

15:54.741 --> 15:57.831
It stands for everything
that he was against.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.549
My dear.

16:03.801 --> 16:07.474
You could never destroy the church.

16:07.559 --> 16:10.857
You don't have an army big enough.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.153
And besides...

16:13.236 --> 16:16.284
your new baby
couldn't handle the stress.

16:18.831 --> 16:20.041
(Leslie gasps)

16:21.503 --> 16:22.881
Who are you?

16:31.480 --> 16:33.151
Hey, Chase.

16:33.234 --> 16:34.779
-CHASE: Dale.
-It's Dale.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.783
-Hey!
-Hey, Dale.

16:36.867 --> 16:39.330
-Dale's back with his beard.
-(Dale laughs)

16:39.413 --> 16:41.083
How ya feelin'?

16:42.127 --> 16:44.465
-AOK.
-DALE: AOK. I'm gonna ask you

16:44.549 --> 16:46.845
-a few questions, Chase, OK?
-CHASE: Mm-hmm.

16:46.929 --> 16:49.183
-Do you know who the president is?
-Yep.

16:49.266 --> 16:50.770
-DALE: Yeah?
-Yep.

16:50.853 --> 16:53.901
OK. Where have you been sleeping,
Chase?

16:53.984 --> 16:56.280
-Uh, with Gert.
-Oh.

16:56.364 --> 16:59.453
Or I-- I was, but we got in a fight.

16:59.537 --> 17:02.543
But we're back together now,
I think.

17:02.627 --> 17:05.508
Well, relationships are tough, right?

17:05.590 --> 17:08.888
But we got the coolest bed.

17:08.973 --> 17:11.936
Oh! Oh, I miss it. I miss it.

17:12.896 --> 17:16.153
-We had some great times together.
-DALE: Oh, OK.

17:16.237 --> 17:17.781
Yeah. Naked.

17:17.865 --> 17:20.453
-STACEY: Oh.
-OK, Chase? Chase.

17:20.538 --> 17:22.583
-CHASE: Yeah.
-What else?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.211
-And Dale?
-DALE: Yeah?

17:24.295 --> 17:27.134
Do you know Old Lace
and Gert are connected?

17:27.217 --> 17:29.054
DALE:
Of course. Yeah.

17:29.138 --> 17:33.021
But I'm not sure which one is the animal,
if you know what I mean.

17:33.104 --> 17:34.816
-(laughs)
-DALE: We do.

17:36.528 --> 17:38.406
-Sexually.
-DALE: Yes, we got it.

17:38.489 --> 17:40.620
-STACEY: All right.
-TINA: What a shit show.

17:40.703 --> 17:43.667
How did he get here?
You need to start talking. Now.

17:43.751 --> 17:45.755
I told you, I can't say anything.

17:45.838 --> 17:49.721
She means us, Chase.
And this is none of your business.

17:49.804 --> 17:53.520
-Tell me how he got here.
-We're wasting time, Tina.

17:53.604 --> 17:55.566
DALE: Oh, darn it. Chase!

17:55.650 --> 17:57.319
STACEY: Is he gone?

17:57.402 --> 17:59.323
DALE: He's out.

17:59.406 --> 18:00.785
(Stacey sighs)

18:02.037 --> 18:03.247
DALE:
Oh no, you don't.

18:03.331 --> 18:06.170
No, you don't. We are one child away
from a clean break.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.548
I am not going to let you blow it.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.513
Get in the basement.

18:10.596 --> 18:11.682
Stace.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.021
(scoffs) You wouldn't.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.566
Don't you look at me like that.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.572
You think because I'm wearing a tunic
I won't drop your skinny ass?

18:19.656 --> 18:21.618
Go ahead and find out.

18:21.702 --> 18:25.500
I would listen to her.
She's been a bit on edge lately.

18:27.212 --> 18:28.799
Walk.

18:35.395 --> 18:36.480
DALE: Chase...

18:43.494 --> 18:45.165
-JANET: How was it?
-VICTOR: Great.

18:45.248 --> 18:47.085
Clean bill of health.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.634
(kisses) Turns out that Jonah
was actually a damn good doctor.

18:50.718 --> 18:53.640
Whatever he did
in that healing algorithm worked.

18:53.724 --> 18:56.395
-What about the brain tumor?
-Janet, there was no sign of it.

18:56.479 --> 18:58.567
Or the gunshot wound.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.696
I'm beginning to wonder if we...

19:00.780 --> 19:02.909
made a big mistake killing Jonah.

19:02.992 --> 19:05.205
The man was a true genius.

19:05.288 --> 19:07.042
How was the PRIDE meeting?

19:07.125 --> 19:08.921
-It went well.
-Yeah?

19:09.004 --> 19:10.758
Everyone was very impressed
with the new weapons.

19:10.841 --> 19:13.931
Ha! As they should be.
Those weapons are some of my best work.

19:14.014 --> 19:17.730
The light-reflecting thermal material
alone would win me a Nobel.

19:17.814 --> 19:19.483
(laughs) If anyone knew about it.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.865
I even got to show off a little
of my knowledge of wave theory,

19:22.949 --> 19:24.661
-which was fun.
-Great.

19:24.744 --> 19:28.376
But you know, Victor...

19:28.459 --> 19:30.756
I'm starting to wonder if we're
going about this the right way.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.052
No, Chase needs to come home. Now.

19:33.135 --> 19:35.516
-We can't wait any longer.
-JANET: But that's just it.

19:35.599 --> 19:38.689
We're spending so much energy
trying to neutralize the kids.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.402
Wouldn't an emotional appeal be faster?

19:41.485 --> 19:43.406
Janet...

19:43.489 --> 19:45.619
I appreciate your maternal instinct.

19:46.705 --> 19:49.794
But I don't think we can just talk about
our feelings and the kids'll come home.

19:49.878 --> 19:51.548
We don't even know where they are.

19:55.138 --> 19:57.267
But you're the brilliant Victor Stein.

19:57.350 --> 20:00.064
If anyone can figure it out,
you can.

20:00.148 --> 20:01.233
(Victor laughs)

20:01.317 --> 20:03.112
I probably could, couldn't I?

20:04.114 --> 20:07.329
-KAROLINA: Here's the Rolls.
-Alex, you're right. They're still here.

20:07.412 --> 20:10.043
Well, "What would Chase do?"
isn't exactly a tough question.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.253
Come on.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.604
OK. Old Lace lives in the basement,
but Stacey and Dale

20:19.687 --> 20:21.357
usually hang out upstairs
watching British cooking shows.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.069
If we go through
one of the back windows,

20:23.152 --> 20:24.781
-we can take 'em by surprise, and--
-I hate to say it,

20:24.864 --> 20:27.870
but are we sure that Gert and Chase
are here against their will?

20:27.954 --> 20:29.540
Gert would never leave me.

20:30.793 --> 20:33.422
OK. So I brought the Fistigons,

20:33.507 --> 20:35.719
I brought the X-ray goggles,
and I also brought this.

20:35.803 --> 20:38.976
-Alex, is that from the Strike Team?
-What would we do with a gun?

20:39.059 --> 20:40.311
Use it?

20:40.395 --> 20:43.109
OK, OK, my bad.
Wouldn't use it. My bad.

20:44.152 --> 20:45.363
Okay, let's just sneak around the back.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.620
(Chase groaning)

20:50.123 --> 20:52.127
GERT:
Hi. There you are.

20:53.129 --> 20:55.216
Ohh, you had me worried.

20:55.299 --> 20:57.513
(Chase groans)

20:57.596 --> 20:59.684
Oh, I got a headache.

21:01.688 --> 21:03.357
They tried to get me to talk.

21:04.317 --> 21:06.948
GERT: What did you tell them?
Please say "nothing."

21:07.032 --> 21:09.119
TINA: He told your parents
about your cool bed.

21:09.202 --> 21:12.083
-The one you guys were naked in.
-Oh, my God. What did you say?

21:12.167 --> 21:15.131
Nothing that wasn't true.
I mean, it's literally truth serum.

21:15.214 --> 21:17.511
GERT: How could you
tell my parents about...

21:18.513 --> 21:21.393
Speaking of orgasmic,
these pancakes look amazing.

21:21.477 --> 21:23.022
-Tina, no more talking.
-TINA: Might be to your benefit

21:23.105 --> 21:24.984
to speak to me.

21:25.068 --> 21:26.988
I know some things about PRIDE
that you might find useful.

21:27.072 --> 21:30.203
Oh, yeah? Like what? Tell us.

21:30.286 --> 21:32.958
Why would she tell us
what's going on with PRIDE?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.837
Don't trust her.
She's just another evil parent.

21:34.921 --> 21:36.215
TINA:
We're not all the same.

21:36.298 --> 21:38.052
There are different kinds of evil, Gert.

21:40.389 --> 21:43.187
Fine. OK...

21:44.524 --> 21:46.026
...what's going on with PRIDE?

21:52.163 --> 21:54.544
They're declaring war. On you.

21:54.627 --> 21:57.883
New weapons, the whole shebang.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.639
If I were you, I would run...

22:00.722 --> 22:02.392
while you still have time.

22:04.354 --> 22:07.653
Or you could just stay here
and give in. Is this so bad?

22:07.736 --> 22:10.366
-Stacey can cook.
-GERT: Of course it's so bad.

22:10.449 --> 22:12.370
They've taken us hostage
and Old Lace is in pain

22:12.453 --> 22:15.209
-and we have to get her out of here.
-She's bioengineered, Gert.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.046
If she dies, they just make a new one.

22:18.508 --> 22:20.804
Oh, you know what I just realized?

22:20.888 --> 22:24.352
You haven't even asked me about Nico.

22:24.436 --> 22:27.192
Are you wondering...
what's going on with your daughter?

22:28.194 --> 22:29.196
You told me not to talk to you.

22:29.279 --> 22:30.699
(loud crash, alarm blaring)

22:30.782 --> 22:32.076
-TINA: Whoa.
-GERT: Oh, my, God.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.245
-STACEY: What was that?
-DALE: I've had enough

22:33.329 --> 22:34.414
excitement for today.

22:37.045 --> 22:38.464
MOLLY:
Get down on the floor!

22:38.548 --> 22:40.510
-Where's Gert?
-We saw the car. We know they're here.

22:40.594 --> 22:42.013
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

22:42.096 --> 22:44.267
-Wait, what?
-It was yesterday.

22:44.351 --> 22:46.188
STACEY: You look so good.
Doesn't she look so good?

22:46.271 --> 22:47.608
DALE: She does.
You look great, sweetie.

22:47.691 --> 22:49.987
-So happy you decided to come home.
-Yeah.

22:50.071 --> 22:51.991
-You guys are not my parents.
-What?

22:52.075 --> 22:56.041
Because my parents
would never hurt Old Lace and Gert.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.379
(Old Lace screeches)

22:58.462 --> 23:00.634
Go get 'em. I got this.

23:00.717 --> 23:01.886
Honey--

23:02.846 --> 23:03.932
Honey?

23:06.103 --> 23:08.775
Alex. How experienced
are you with that thing?

23:08.858 --> 23:10.111
Not very.

23:14.745 --> 23:15.831
MOLLY:
Oh, you're still alive!

23:15.914 --> 23:17.417
CHASE: What happened
with the Strike Team?

23:17.500 --> 23:18.545
KAROLINA: That's a whole thing,
but everybody's OK.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.131
Strike Team. You mean AWOL?

23:20.214 --> 23:22.553
KAROLINA: Yeah.
You won't be seeing him for a while.

23:22.636 --> 23:25.433
-What is she doing here?
-Also a whole thing.

23:25.517 --> 23:28.272
GERT: It's been a day. And a night.
We'll tell you about it later.

23:28.355 --> 23:30.443
-You're not going anywhere.
-(Old Lace screeches)

23:30.527 --> 23:32.948
-Gotta get Old Lace.
-On it.

23:34.577 --> 23:36.664
STACEY: Honestly, I--
I don't even--

23:36.748 --> 23:37.916
GERT: Put them over there.
Her too.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.712
-STACEY: Sweetheart--
-ALEX: Stop talking.

23:41.381 --> 23:43.887
DALE: OK.
Everyone, let's just...

23:45.891 --> 23:48.395
Honey. What are you
gonna do with us?

23:48.479 --> 23:49.690
Nothing you don't deserve.

23:52.403 --> 23:53.907
(Molly roars)

23:56.078 --> 23:57.497
-(Old Lace growling)
-Let's go.

24:01.171 --> 24:02.549
(clatter)

24:02.633 --> 24:04.135
(roaring)

24:11.149 --> 24:13.445
-CHASE: Come on, Gert, let's go!
-Where's Lace?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.449
GERT:
I don't know. She was right behind me.

24:18.038 --> 24:21.461
-(roaring)
-OK, Old Lace, we didn't mean any harm.

24:21.546 --> 24:24.259
-I just wanted our kids back.
-That's it, we just wanted our kids back.

24:24.342 --> 24:25.720
TINA:
Speak for yourself.

24:25.804 --> 24:27.056
(roars)

24:28.643 --> 24:29.687
DALE: Hey, girl.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.732
Keep your damn claws off her.

24:32.358 --> 24:33.528
(weapon fires)

24:33.611 --> 24:34.697
-(Old Lace roars)
-(thud)

24:34.780 --> 24:36.450
She's taking way too long.
Should I call her?

24:36.534 --> 24:37.661
No, we've made enough noise already.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.707
I'm trying to tune into her,
but I'm not getting anything.

24:39.790 --> 24:43.255
-What if something happened?
-How much longer should we wait?

24:43.338 --> 24:45.886
None. The rest of our parents
could be on the way.

24:45.969 --> 24:48.558
What? No, no.
We can't just leave without Old Lace.

24:48.641 --> 24:50.436
Yeah, we have to.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.606
You know we do.

24:54.653 --> 24:55.739
I'm sorry.

24:57.158 --> 24:58.243
She'll find us.

25:04.297 --> 25:05.509
(clatter)

25:10.392 --> 25:11.979
(Nico panting)

25:41.581 --> 25:43.125
No more shall I suffer.

25:46.882 --> 25:47.926
No more shall I be hurt.

25:50.974 --> 25:52.603
No more shall I hurt another.

26:10.012 --> 26:11.932
I sever my ties with thee.

27:19.317 --> 27:23.701
LESLIE: I didn't tell anyone
I was pregnant...

27:23.784 --> 27:26.582
because I didn't want
to face it myself.

27:27.876 --> 27:32.343
My greatest fear is failing
as a mother again.

27:33.846 --> 27:36.434
And I'm sure that is yours, as well.

27:38.146 --> 27:41.737
But I want you to know
I forgive you.

27:53.761 --> 27:55.264
They made you leave.

27:56.099 --> 27:57.519
Didn't they?

27:59.438 --> 28:01.986
Because you wanted to protect me.

28:03.531 --> 28:08.039
From Jonah, from...
from his interest in me, so...

28:09.876 --> 28:12.507
they declared that you were
an Aphotic Person,

28:12.591 --> 28:13.926
that you had no light.

28:15.012 --> 28:18.184
And they brought you here,
they-- they kept us apart.

28:20.314 --> 28:23.194
But you wanted to be with me
all along, right?

28:24.280 --> 28:25.575
Right?

28:33.507 --> 28:34.801
Susan?

28:38.601 --> 28:40.395
I know who you are.

28:44.445 --> 28:46.407
-Susan!
-(gasps)

28:48.788 --> 28:50.750
Say something.

28:51.501 --> 28:52.962
Please, Susan.

28:53.756 --> 28:55.217
You weren't...

28:55.718 --> 28:59.100
supposed to say my name!

28:59.183 --> 29:01.647
No, no, it's OK.

29:01.730 --> 29:04.695
I wish you hadn't done that.
I wish you hadn't--

29:06.990 --> 29:08.994
Now I have to report you!

29:09.078 --> 29:10.873
-Guard!
-LESLIE: Where are you going?

29:11.959 --> 29:13.921
I told you not to fight this.

29:30.705 --> 29:32.416
-(beep)
-WOMAN: This is Dr. Novak's office

29:32.499 --> 29:36.007
calling to reschedule
this morning's missed appointment.

29:36.090 --> 29:37.301
Please call us back at--

29:37.384 --> 29:38.679
(beep)

29:40.850 --> 29:43.647
(static, beeping)

29:45.358 --> 29:46.945
JANET:
A landline?

29:47.029 --> 29:49.993
I thought you declared
those were for troglodytes in 2004.

29:50.076 --> 29:52.707
VICTOR:
I did and they are.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.757
But California has what's called
a "soft tone" for emergencies.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.094
Even a dead line works
to call 9-1-1.

29:59.178 --> 30:01.600
JANET: Well, that sounds like great trivia
for our next cocktail party,

30:01.683 --> 30:03.228
but how is it gonna
help us find Chase?

30:03.311 --> 30:06.400
Well, a phone call's just
sound converted to electricity

30:06.484 --> 30:07.821
then back to sound.

30:07.904 --> 30:09.908
I think I found a way to reverse it

30:09.991 --> 30:12.454
so that those lines
don't just make calls,

30:12.539 --> 30:13.958
they can receive one, too.

30:14.709 --> 30:18.341
My plan is to push a signal
into every landline

30:18.424 --> 30:21.013
inside the grid
in which Geoffrey pinpointed the kids.

30:21.097 --> 30:22.767
Think you could use
robo-call technology?

30:22.851 --> 30:24.813
That way you can make
thousands calls at once--

30:24.896 --> 30:29.446
Throw in some voice recognition software
to rule out everyone but Chase, and...

30:29.531 --> 30:30.950
JANET:
Victor, this could actually work.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.954
We'll need plenty of luck
and a lot of patience,

30:33.037 --> 30:34.583
but I think so.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.797
How is it possible
that you're getting even smarter?

30:37.881 --> 30:39.091
(chuckles)

30:47.024 --> 30:49.571
MOLLY: If this is fifteen, I don't know
how I'm gonna make it to sixteen.

30:49.654 --> 30:51.240
KAROLINA:
I know, Mols, I'm sorry.

30:52.492 --> 30:53.746
CHASE:
It's gonna be OK.

30:54.748 --> 30:56.375
How can you say that?

30:58.505 --> 31:01.511
Gert, you had to leave Old Lace behind.

31:01.595 --> 31:04.266
Chase, you got drugged
and interrogated.

31:04.350 --> 31:07.690
Alex, your mom killed Darius,
and now Livvie's gone.

31:07.774 --> 31:10.780
And Nico lost her sister,
and then had to kill to protect us.

31:10.863 --> 31:14.119
And Karolina, your girlfriend
killed your dad.

31:14.203 --> 31:17.961
Why am I the only one crying?
We should all be crying.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.756
We're trying to be strong for you.

31:19.839 --> 31:21.677
Or we just haven't wanted
to feel anything.

31:22.762 --> 31:24.599
I'm not much of a crier, actually.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.561
GERT:
Maybe we've all been in denial.

31:26.645 --> 31:29.526
I'm not gonna lie. Till today
I secretly thought Dale and Stacey

31:29.609 --> 31:30.945
were better than
the rest of PRIDE.

31:31.028 --> 31:34.284
In their defense,
they did think they were helping us.

31:35.913 --> 31:38.711
They lost their kids--
and their moral compass--

31:38.794 --> 31:40.463
but I'm not here to judge.

31:40.548 --> 31:42.677
I just think they would
take it all back if they could.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.388
Yeah, well...
I'm totally here to judge.

31:44.471 --> 31:46.434
I'm so sick of this.

31:46.518 --> 31:48.564
We can't let our parents rob us
of everything good

31:48.647 --> 31:49.691
just because they're bad.

31:49.774 --> 31:51.945
It's Molly's birthday.

31:52.029 --> 31:55.076
We're gonna have a birthday party.
And not just any party...

31:55.160 --> 31:57.372
-A quinceañera?
-Yup.

31:57.456 --> 31:59.836
MOLLY:
What? I don't need anything like that.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.631
GERT:
I kind of love it.

32:01.715 --> 32:02.925
CHASE:
I think that's a great idea.

32:04.053 --> 32:05.263
NICO:
We're doing it.

32:05.346 --> 32:06.933
-MOLLY: Nico?
-CHASE: Hey, you're back!

32:07.017 --> 32:09.021
KAROLINA:
Nico, you're OK.

32:09.104 --> 32:11.568
We've got money from the Strike Team.
Let's do something good with it.

32:13.822 --> 32:15.450
What? But--

32:15.534 --> 32:18.039
Old Lace isn't here.
We can't have a party without Old Lace.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.797
We'll have another one
when she gets back.

32:21.880 --> 32:25.888
-Which she will.
-Come on, Mols. We all need this.

32:27.975 --> 32:30.021
A quinceañera? Really?

32:30.606 --> 32:32.610
(female singing "Pretty in Pink"
in Spanish)

33:37.573 --> 33:39.409
We need to find
some music for the waltz.

33:39.493 --> 33:41.539
I'm not sure how much waltzing
you're gonna do in those heels.

33:42.625 --> 33:44.169
They're for the changing of the shoes--

33:44.253 --> 33:46.465
when you take off your flat ones
and put on your high heels.

33:46.549 --> 33:48.637
And go from a girl...to a woman.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.518
Or from a subject to object.

33:51.601 --> 33:53.522
And after the shoes,
you dance with your chambelan.

33:53.605 --> 33:55.066
With your who?

33:55.149 --> 33:56.778
It's like your escort.

33:56.861 --> 33:57.947
Have you thought about
who it's gonna be yet?

33:58.030 --> 33:59.575
GERT:
Guess it has to be between

33:59.659 --> 34:00.995
Chase and Alex?

34:01.078 --> 34:03.542
Hmm. Or me. I've got moves.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.921
I assumed Molly wanted
to go heteronormative on this one.

34:06.005 --> 34:08.802
I haven't decided yet.
Stop pressuring me.

34:08.885 --> 34:12.309
-Don't even think about looking in these.
-I would never. That would ruin it.

34:12.391 --> 34:14.478
OK, everyone,
find me some music.

34:14.563 --> 34:16.358
Oh, um...

34:16.442 --> 34:18.780
you mean music as in, like,
we're talkin' about dancin'?

34:18.864 --> 34:21.159
NICO:
Traditionally what people dance to.

34:21.243 --> 34:22.621
'Cause I don't--
I don't dance.

34:22.705 --> 34:24.833
Little light flossing maybe,
but nothing in public.

34:24.917 --> 34:27.339
So you floss in private?

34:27.422 --> 34:29.342
CHASE:
I, on the other hand,

34:29.426 --> 34:31.179
am quite graceful on the dance floor.

34:31.263 --> 34:33.309
Coach Alphona made us
take ballroom dancing

34:33.391 --> 34:35.606
to strengthen the lower body
and increase flexibility.

34:35.688 --> 34:36.900
He's a very committed dancer.

34:36.983 --> 34:40.364
We should have protein powder nearby
in case he gets depleted.

34:40.447 --> 34:42.202
Chase?

34:42.284 --> 34:44.873
Would you like to be my chambelan
for my quinceañera?

34:44.956 --> 34:46.543
Molly, I'd be honored.

34:47.713 --> 34:48.840
MOLLY:
Thanks.

34:53.431 --> 34:55.268
OK, what's a chambelon?

34:55.353 --> 34:57.148
(Molly laughs)

35:03.244 --> 35:05.456
Hi. I'm Xavin.

35:05.541 --> 35:06.918
Hi.

35:12.262 --> 35:13.682
Do I know you?

35:14.726 --> 35:16.604
I've been looking for you.

35:35.183 --> 35:36.686
GERT: Hey! Karolina!

35:36.770 --> 35:38.523
We need you over here!
It's v-important.

35:44.911 --> 35:46.455
(Runaways chattering)

35:46.539 --> 35:49.754
XAVIN'S VOICE:
Nice to meet you, Karolina.

36:19.605 --> 36:23.989
It's so "Molly." I'm basically killing
the chambelini game.

36:24.072 --> 36:25.784
I'm wondering if we chose
the right color.

36:25.868 --> 36:29.457
I have a feeling Gert's gonna say pink
is a signifier of hegemonic femininity.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.461
Yeah, but then Molly will say
that she's reclaiming pink

36:31.546 --> 36:32.756
and making it her own.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.009
Trust me.

36:34.886 --> 36:37.265
Not that I totally understand
what this thing's for.

36:37.348 --> 36:40.021
ALEX:
It's a symbol. The last toy.

36:40.104 --> 36:42.568
After this, Molly's supposed
to give up her childhood.

36:42.651 --> 36:44.404
Hasn't she already done that?

36:44.487 --> 36:46.450
I mean, who's had to grow up
faster than Molly?

36:46.534 --> 36:50.249
Yeah, and then her adoptive parents
turn out to be serial killers.

36:51.544 --> 36:53.422
Do you know that Dale and Stacey,

36:53.506 --> 36:55.217
they were actually really nice to us.

36:55.301 --> 36:57.681
Dude, they had you locked
in their basement.

36:57.765 --> 36:59.267
Why are you so busy
trying to defend them?

36:59.351 --> 37:03.067
No. I'm not. I'm just...

37:03.150 --> 37:05.948
sometimes we forget that
our parents still love us, that's all.

37:06.031 --> 37:07.618
Do they?

37:07.701 --> 37:09.371
Got a funny way of showing it.

37:11.626 --> 37:13.588
After what Tina said,
I'm starting to wonder

37:13.672 --> 37:15.592
if it's even worth it
to fight 'em anymore.

37:17.930 --> 37:20.476
Did you just say you're wondering
if we shouldn't even fight 'em anymore?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.397
We can't win against our parents, Alex.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.150
We can hide, but we can't win.

37:24.234 --> 37:25.862
That's what they want you to think!

37:25.946 --> 37:28.450
Look, all I know is that
I'm bringing my parents to justice

37:28.535 --> 37:29.996
if it's the last thing I do.

37:30.079 --> 37:33.628
All right, they've cost me Livvie,
Darius, home-- everything.

37:36.216 --> 37:37.678
I'm gonna go change.

37:51.539 --> 37:53.626
OK. Now open.

37:57.383 --> 37:59.179
It feels weird.

37:59.262 --> 38:02.018
-You look so stunning.
-And check out this curl.

38:02.101 --> 38:04.022
GERT:
Molly, don't listen to these girls.

38:04.105 --> 38:05.441
They're like drug dealers.

38:05.525 --> 38:07.905
Repeat after me:
"I cannot be improved upon."

38:07.988 --> 38:09.199
-(all laugh)
-GERT: Hey, say it! Loud!

38:09.282 --> 38:12.413
ALL:
I cannot be improved upon!

38:12.497 --> 38:14.375
(all repeating phrase)

38:16.088 --> 38:19.678
(overlapping phone conversations,
static)

38:20.555 --> 38:23.728
(overlapping phone conversations
continue)

38:31.661 --> 38:33.247
(phone ringing)

38:35.710 --> 38:38.090
(ringing continues)

38:42.098 --> 38:44.060
(ringing)

38:48.653 --> 38:50.072
(ringing)

38:51.199 --> 38:52.493
Hello?

38:52.578 --> 38:56.126
-(alarm sounding)
-(phone ringing)

38:59.633 --> 39:02.973
-CHASE: Hello?
-(relieved sigh) Chase.

39:03.850 --> 39:05.102
Son.

39:05.186 --> 39:07.566
-Thank God it worked.
-Wait, dad, is that you?

39:07.649 --> 39:10.572
VICTOR: It's me, son.
We need to talk.

39:13.493 --> 39:15.916
Your, um...

39:15.999 --> 39:19.339
your mother doesn't know...

39:19.422 --> 39:21.468
but I'm sick.

39:24.015 --> 39:25.560
Really sick.

39:28.273 --> 39:30.904
I uh-- I thought I was getting better,
but I'm not.

39:30.987 --> 39:33.993
And I um...

39:34.077 --> 39:36.999
I want to see you...

39:37.083 --> 39:39.003
before time runs out.

39:42.176 --> 39:44.515
(voice breaking)
So can you come home?

39:46.811 --> 39:48.146
Please.

39:50.317 --> 39:52.238
ALEX:
Hey. Just about ready?

39:52.321 --> 39:54.367
CHASE: Uh, yeah. Yeah.

39:54.409 --> 39:56.021
[clears throat]

39:58.166 --> 39:59.545
Wait, Dad.

40:01.423 --> 40:02.634
Dad, are you there?

40:03.845 --> 40:06.266
GERT:
One day in the first grade--

40:06.349 --> 40:08.478
I will never forget it,

40:08.563 --> 40:12.904
I was eating my snack
of apple slices and peanut butter,

40:12.988 --> 40:16.954
and my parents sat me down
and they said,

40:17.038 --> 40:20.795
"Gert, we have life-changing news.

40:20.879 --> 40:24.010
"Your little friend Molly...

40:24.093 --> 40:26.348
well, she's gonna be your sister now."

40:27.934 --> 40:30.774
And I remember thinking, "Finally!"

40:30.857 --> 40:34.907
Because I had always wanted
either a sister or a puppy

40:34.990 --> 40:40.835
ever since I realized the only thing
Barbie really does is wear outfits.

40:40.919 --> 40:44.467
And Molly Hayes Hernandez...

40:44.551 --> 40:47.516
you turned out to be
so much better than a puppy.

40:48.768 --> 40:51.356
As you turn fifteen,

40:51.439 --> 40:54.404
one thing is becoming super-clear.

40:54.487 --> 40:57.577
I didn't just get a sister;

40:57.661 --> 40:59.414
I got a hero.

40:59.497 --> 41:02.671
Someone who teaches me

41:02.754 --> 41:06.679
and inspires me and lifts me up.

41:06.762 --> 41:09.434
And I think I speak for all of us
when I say,

41:09.518 --> 41:12.398
"Molly, thank you so much
for being you."

41:12.481 --> 41:15.822
FEMALE VOCALIST:
♪ Tomorrow is still far away... ♪

41:15.905 --> 41:17.742
I love you, Mols.

41:17.826 --> 41:21.249
Gert's right. We are family.

41:21.332 --> 41:24.590
And yet, no one can replace
your mom and dad.

41:26.092 --> 41:28.514
They would be very proud
of the person you are today.

41:28.598 --> 41:32.480
So...I would like to dedicate
this dance to them.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.651
OK.

41:37.741 --> 41:40.120
♪ We're still dreaming,

41:40.204 --> 41:42.166

42:50.135 --> 42:54.603
Yes. I can feel the vodka
blocking the glutamate as we speak.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.821
Do you think Tina's going
to tell PRIDE what happened?

42:59.905 --> 43:01.282
-Well--
-Never mind.

43:01.366 --> 43:05.165
I know the answer to that. Tina's going
to do whatever's best for Tina.

43:05.248 --> 43:07.002
That is true.

43:07.086 --> 43:08.839
She has been acting
rather odd lately,

43:08.923 --> 43:11.762
-don't you think?
-Yeah, well, she is a Minoru.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.565
You know, Stace, I-- I feel like
I-- I have to tell you,

43:17.649 --> 43:21.239
I'm not sure that I forgive you...
for what you did.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.748
Don't be absurd. You know I was only
doing what was best for the kids.

43:25.832 --> 43:29.255
That's not an excuse for...
poisoning anyone.

43:29.338 --> 43:31.677
Oh, look at you
on your high horse again.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.096
Fine. Be like that.

43:33.179 --> 43:34.933
DALE:
Hang on.

43:35.016 --> 43:37.354
That was a really difficult thing
for me to say.

43:38.983 --> 43:41.446
Do you want a cookie now?

43:41.530 --> 43:44.076
You don't get a reward
for confronting Mommy, Dale.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.040
Wow, someone get into
the sodium thiopental again?

43:47.124 --> 43:48.334
(short laugh)

43:48.418 --> 43:50.590
(Old Lace roars in distance)

43:53.011 --> 43:56.769
OK. Now, that is not good.

44:00.358 --> 44:01.945
Stace, I'm gonna suggest something.

44:02.029 --> 44:05.410
It may sound a little extreme,
but I need you to consider it.

44:05.494 --> 44:07.164
Hmm. Just say it.

44:07.247 --> 44:10.128
OK, OK.
Um, well, I, hon,

44:10.212 --> 44:13.928
think we need
to put the deinonychus down.

44:14.011 --> 44:15.388
She's violent, she's dangerous,

44:15.472 --> 44:18.019
after today she is clearly
out of control.

44:18.102 --> 44:19.396
So you mean kill Old Lace.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.275
-Well--
-STACEY: Absolutely not.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.614
Gert loves that beast.
And now we know they're connected.

44:23.697 --> 44:27.831
Right, we hurt the dinosaur,
then we hurt Gert. Of course.

44:27.914 --> 44:31.045
No. Well, I mean, yes,
but that's not why.

44:31.128 --> 44:33.884
Well, why?
What other reason could there be?

44:35.930 --> 44:37.934
Because we can use her.

44:40.690 --> 44:44.071
We let Old Lace go,
and their little telepathic connection

44:44.154 --> 44:45.783
means she'll lead us straight
to Gert and Molly...

44:45.867 --> 44:47.286
=BOTH: ...wherever they are.
-Right.

44:51.085 --> 44:52.755
And then...

44:52.839 --> 44:53.966
we kill her.

45:04.821 --> 45:05.907
Hi.

45:07.075 --> 45:08.286
Hi.

45:11.585 --> 45:13.672
You were so great tonight.

45:15.509 --> 45:18.557
Thank you. I...

45:18.641 --> 45:20.519
I've never seen Molly so happy.

45:22.105 --> 45:23.399
I'm glad.

45:26.155 --> 45:27.115
Um--

45:27.157 --> 45:28.744
Do you wanna--

45:28.827 --> 45:32.376
do you wanna have a sleepover
in my room?

45:32.459 --> 45:34.506
My bed's really cool.

45:42.689 --> 45:43.774
What are you doing?

45:43.857 --> 45:46.070
I, um...

45:52.499 --> 45:53.877
I'm leaving.

45:58.094 --> 45:59.764
-Gert.
-GERT: Oh.

46:02.895 --> 46:04.106
Oh, I get it.

46:05.526 --> 46:08.031
What do you mean you get it?
You get what?

46:08.114 --> 46:09.909
I just got it.

46:09.993 --> 46:11.663
Oh, my God.

46:13.416 --> 46:15.671
I didn't really see it until now.

46:18.134 --> 46:19.303
You're a coward.

46:22.184 --> 46:23.854
You were always gonna leave,
weren't you?

46:23.937 --> 46:25.941
That's not fair.
You haven't even asked me why.

46:26.025 --> 46:27.570
Were you just gonna leave
without saying anything?

46:27.653 --> 46:30.075
Don't try to act all perfect.
You wanted to leave too.

46:30.158 --> 46:33.456
-You even said you wanted to leave.
-But I didn't...

46:33.540 --> 46:35.043
did I?

46:35.126 --> 46:37.172
CHASE:
Gert, my dad is sick. OK?

46:37.255 --> 46:38.884
He needs me.

46:38.967 --> 46:41.973
And we're against people
that we can't beat or outrun.

46:42.057 --> 46:44.186
-You heard what Tina said.
-Tina?!

46:46.065 --> 46:47.652
Oh, you know what?

46:48.695 --> 46:50.448
Forget it, Chase.

46:52.912 --> 46:56.545
I could argue with you,
I could...make a scene,

46:56.628 --> 46:59.968
I could scream, cry...

47:02.305 --> 47:04.769
I could give you
a point-by-point rebuttal,

47:04.853 --> 47:06.355
and none of that would matter

47:06.438 --> 47:09.153
because you want to go.

47:09.236 --> 47:13.077
And if that's how you feel,
then that's what you should do. Go.

47:16.417 --> 47:19.131
You're not just gonna sneak out of here
without saying goodbye.

47:20.718 --> 47:23.139
MOLLY (crying):
Can't I just have one day?

47:23.222 --> 47:25.728
Can I have one day...

47:25.811 --> 47:28.692
where I have to have
everything bad happening?

47:28.775 --> 47:30.779
ALEX: Whoa. What's going on?
Why were these in my bed?

47:30.863 --> 47:33.827
-Chase is leaving.
-What?

47:33.911 --> 47:35.831
Where are you going?

47:35.915 --> 47:37.585
-I'm going home.
-He's leaving us.

47:37.668 --> 47:39.797
Wait, you're--you're leaving?

47:39.881 --> 47:43.262
-Chase, you can't do this.
-Dude, come on, man. Don't leave.

47:44.807 --> 47:48.064
I'm sorry. I really am.

47:48.147 --> 47:51.153
Look, I don't expect
you guys to understand.

47:52.573 --> 47:55.829
But when I walked into this place,
I was a dumb kid.

47:57.499 --> 48:01.925
But because of everything
that we've been through, I...

48:02.008 --> 48:04.388
I grew up.

48:04.471 --> 48:05.933
Because of all you guys.

48:06.016 --> 48:08.229
You guys taught me that

48:08.312 --> 48:11.653
I don't have to just go along
with the group.

48:12.780 --> 48:14.366
And you know what?

48:15.619 --> 48:17.540
That's why I'm leaving.

48:19.459 --> 48:23.050
I'm leaving because being here,
it doesn't feel right anymore.

48:26.766 --> 48:28.854
You guys are...good.

48:28.937 --> 48:31.526
(Chase chuckles)

48:31.609 --> 48:33.195
You guys are so good.

48:36.953 --> 48:39.584
But there's just somewhere else
I gotta be right now.
