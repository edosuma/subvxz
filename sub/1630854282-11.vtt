The sheriff?
[scoffs]

31:03.862 --> 31:07.275
Can't say I approve
of his choice in township...

31:07.379 --> 31:09.482
but he seems like a fine man.

31:09.586 --> 31:13.172
His family certainly has taken
a keen interest in the railroad.

31:13.275 --> 31:15.448
The Davidsons have their fingers
in many pies.

31:15.551 --> 31:19.000
Influential folks, if you catch
my meaning, but the sheriff

31:19.103 --> 31:21.517
has always been
aboveboard with me.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.655
Glad to hear it.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.413
-Thank you.
-Yes.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.241
I will just go file this,
make it official.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.655
Good, and then I can get
out of this hellhole.

31:31.758 --> 31:34.137
I'll show you out.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.620
Well, not much to say.

31:38.724 --> 31:41.655
It has truly been a pleasure,
Mr. Briggs.

31:41.758 --> 31:44.000
Give me all your money, now.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.793
Fine, fine, fine.
Just take, take it all.

31:45.896 --> 31:47.931
Just don't kill me. Not here.

31:55.482 --> 31:57.793
What, you got manure
in your ears,

31:57.896 --> 31:59.413

31:59.517 --> 32:01.655

32:17.310 --> 32:19.965

[laughs]

32:20.068 --> 32:22.965
You just don't have the guts
to pull the trigger and end it.

32:23.068 --> 32:25.034
You're so smug.

32:25.137 --> 32:27.655
It's a wonder
no one's killed you yet.

32:27.758 --> 32:29.689
Well, you tried, didn't you?

32:29.793 --> 32:32.137
But just like everything else...

32:33.034 --> 32:35.034
...you failed.

32:35.137 --> 32:37.862
It's no wonder
why you wanted me dead.

32:37.965 --> 32:39.862
You said it yourself,
I was the one

32:39.965 --> 32:41.413
that was locked up
in that asylum.

32:41.517 --> 32:45.241
And the family
still chose me over you.

32:46.413 --> 32:49.000
I never could fool you, could I?

32:49.103 --> 32:51.896
Just hired the wrong man
to do it.

32:52.724 --> 32:55.344
Surprise, surprise.

32:55.448 --> 32:58.344
Another failure
to add to the list.

32:58.448 --> 33:00.689
But I promise it's the last.

33:00.793 --> 33:04.034
I'm gonna finish the job
that Levi couldn't.

33:04.931 --> 33:07.275
I hope you don't mind.

33:07.379 --> 33:10.413

Mmm.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.620
Well, documents are
signed and filed.

33:33.724 --> 33:36.310
Briggs is halfway
to Nacogdoches by now,

33:36.413 --> 33:38.344
and Smith is contributing
to the local economy

of a White Dove or two.

33:40.344 --> 33:42.137

Mm.

when you beat the railroad

33:46.172 --> 33:47.758

-It is, indeed.

Despite a few...

33:49.655 --> 33:51.068

Sorry, Cal.

Well, regardless,
working together,

33:55.827 --> 33:57.689
we did it.

33:57.793 --> 33:59.586
Thank you.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.724
All of you, really.

34:01.827 --> 34:03.344
This bought me time.

34:03.448 --> 34:05.034

Yeah, I got to go, too.

in that condition,

34:09.206 --> 34:10.447

34:10.551 --> 34:12.137
And that's just for starters.

-Hmm?

Thought you should know,

34:25.310 --> 34:27.172
Kai was in here earlier.

34:27.275 --> 34:29.034
He saw you
with the railroad man.

34:29.137 --> 34:31.034
Didn't look happy.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.241
You should see him.

34:33.344 --> 34:35.172
Something's up.

34:35.275 --> 34:37.688
Yeah. Thanks.

34:40.482 --> 34:42.862
You know those telegrams
Tom told you he sent?

34:42.965 --> 34:44.793
-Hmm.
-Well, he lied.

34:44.896 --> 34:47.447
Now, I don't know what's going
on with that brother of his,

34:47.551 --> 34:50.931
but now that Calian's situation
has been... handled,

34:51.034 --> 34:52.862
oh, I'm-a find out.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.000
Briggs, the land grant officer,
had nothing

34:55.103 --> 34:56.896
but good things
to say about Tom.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.517
He was less effusive
about the rest of the Davidsons.

34:59.620 --> 35:02.034
Yeah, that family has been
stirring up trouble

35:02.137 --> 35:03.689
-for a while now.
-Hmm.

35:03.793 --> 35:05.241
You know, like it or not,

35:05.344 --> 35:07.448
Tom's a Davidson.

35:07.551 --> 35:09.724
I think it's about time
I go out to that ranch

35:09.827 --> 35:11.793
and have a talk
with them myself.

35:11.896 --> 35:14.172
Who are you going to speak to?

35:14.965 --> 35:16.206
[chuckles]

35:16.310 --> 35:18.068
Whichever one
I come across first.

35:18.172 --> 35:20.344
Ah.

35:21.724 --> 35:23.068
How about a drink to celebrate?

35:23.172 --> 35:24.310
I'm buying.

35:24.413 --> 35:27.241
Abby, first I have to ask you...

35:29.482 --> 35:31.689
Did you sleep with Tom?

35:38.689 --> 35:41.862
Not quite sure
I believe it myself, but...

35:41.965 --> 35:44.068
that happened.

35:44.172 --> 35:45.862
Abby, for the love of God, why?

35:45.965 --> 35:48.482
I-I don't have a good answer
for you, Kate.

35:50.275 --> 35:53.000
I don't even truly know myself,

35:53.103 --> 35:55.379
but I...

35:57.448 --> 36:00.551
I saw a different side of Tom...

36:00.655 --> 36:03.137
last night.

36:03.241 --> 36:05.241
He's just as lost

36:05.344 --> 36:07.241
and damaged by his family
as I am.

36:07.344 --> 36:09.586
No, that doesn't change the fact

36:09.689 --> 36:13.103
that all of us put our lives
at risk for you,

36:13.206 --> 36:15.206
because you were sure

36:15.310 --> 36:16.827
that he murdered your husband,

36:16.931 --> 36:18.310
that he shot you.

36:18.413 --> 36:20.310
And then not only
did you change your mind,

36:20.413 --> 36:24.620
but you took him to bed,
Abby, and you did it here.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.448
In my house,

36:26.551 --> 36:28.206
where I invited you in.

36:28.310 --> 36:30.137
You can understand
how that is a little bit

36:30.241 --> 36:32.620
-of a hard pill to swallow.
-I do.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.448
-[exhales]
-Kate, I am sorry.

36:35.551 --> 36:38.068
I'm-I'm sorry I put you
in this position.

36:38.172 --> 36:40.137
I-I didn't...

36:40.241 --> 36:42.103
think about
how this would affect you

36:42.206 --> 36:43.758
or-or anyone else.

36:43.862 --> 36:46.241
I don't think
you were thinking at all.

36:47.034 --> 36:48.724
Probably not.

36:49.551 --> 36:52.103
But regardless
of what happened...

36:52.896 --> 36:56.137
...I never meant
to break our trust.

Kate, I need it.

37:00.206 --> 37:02.965
I need our friendship.

37:11.344 --> 37:13.551
So do I.

37:16.310 --> 37:18.413

the new chief.

like drinking alone.

37:54.896 --> 37:56.413
Look, I know
you're a lightweight anyway.

under the table

38:01.034 --> 38:02.931
But at some point,

we're gonna have to talk about
what you did to Tink's mama.

she was his mom.

to help me clean up.

from each other, Kai, and I...

I'm sure that we both
had our reasons.

38:40.413 --> 38:42.586
But what if we don't
do that anymore?

38:42.689 --> 38:44.896
What if we start from scratch?

38:46.103 --> 38:48.896
I would very much like
to know you.

38:50.137 --> 38:51.448
I could do that,

38:51.551 --> 38:54.344
if you could,
but we would have to promise

38:54.448 --> 38:56.586
no more secrets.

I should probably tell you.

The man that you saw me
with at Hagan's,
