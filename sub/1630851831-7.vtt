to trust anymore.

1:11:16.939 --> 1:11:18.908

to go a lot better

1:11:18.975 --> 1:11:21.778

1:11:21.844 --> 1:11:25.281

1:11:25.348 --> 1:11:28.084
I asked, you know,
how could I be there for you

1:11:28.151 --> 1:11:30.787
in times when you're down
or going through it.

1:11:30.853 --> 1:11:33.589
And so you said snacks.
‐ [laughs]

never had those.

um, some of the guys said
that you were feeling unseen,

1:11:55.945 --> 1:11:59.415
and I felt really disappointed
in myself

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:01.050
and sad that you felt that way,

1:12:01.117 --> 1:12:03.052

about you.

1:12:03.119 --> 1:12:05.488
Um, I have feelings for you.

1:12:05.555 --> 1:12:07.990
And I don't want you
to ever feel like that again,

1:12:08.057 --> 1:12:10.359
especially when I'm here.

1:12:10.426 --> 1:12:12.628
And that's why I brought
this blanket as well.

1:12:12.695 --> 1:12:14.730

and confident.

1:12:25.975 --> 1:12:28.244

is challenging himself

1:12:28.311 --> 1:12:30.146

to push himself

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:32.148
