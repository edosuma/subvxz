BOTH: <i>Incendia.</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:07.205
DAMON: <i>How does an evil siren scheme,</i>

00:07.207 --> 00:08.840
involve three-year-olds?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.465
She wants to offer them to Cade.

00:10.467 --> 00:11.543
DAMON: <i>Who's Cade?</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:12.319
<i>What is he?</i>

00:12.321 --> 00:13.310
He's the devil.

00:13.312 --> 00:15.180
So, you want your freedom

00:15.182 --> 00:17.248
in exchange for these two girls.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.529
Cade, do we have a deal or not?

00:18.531 --> 00:19.851
What if I can offer you

00:19.853 --> 00:21.486
a better one? Two brothers.

00:21.488 --> 00:24.055
Two powerful, immortal vampires.

00:24.057 --> 00:24.889
STEFAN: I'll do it.

00:24.891 --> 00:25.957
Just let the girls go.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.292
<i>I don't know how to protect</i>

00:27.294 --> 00:28.259
my own children.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.028
Yes, you dou Take them

00:30.030 --> 00:31.129
someplace safe.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.564
Take them away from me.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.732
SELINE: <i>I'm done.</i>

00:33.734 --> 00:35.767
No more killing in his name.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.768
Sorry, sissy.

00:36.770 --> 00:37.836
You're about to start

00:37.838 --> 00:38.903
making payments

00:38.905 --> 00:40.438
on your karmic debt.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.640
You cut me out of the agreement?

00:42.642 --> 00:43.775
This is for Tyler.

STEFAN: <i>I surrendered</i>

00:47.889 --> 00:49.748
my immortal soul to Cade.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.716
I have to serve him the
way the sirens did

00:51.718 --> 00:53.318
and deliver the darkest souls to hell

00:53.320 --> 00:54.686
so I don't end up there myself.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.155
My one condition was that
I get to spend my last

this Christmas Eve dinner forever,

02:56.576 --> 02:59.043

03:38.485 --> 03:40.151
Oh! Merry Christmas.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.286
Merry Christmas.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.289
Oh! Let me help take your jackets off.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.090
I'm afraid we're not gonna
be able to stay very long.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.458
What? Why?

03:47.460 --> 03:49.527
This is my last day with them for awhile.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.130
Yeah, well, uh,

03:52.132 --> 03:54.832
I take it you haven't spoken with Matt.

03:54.834 --> 03:55.833
No.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.502
Is Seline coming to dinner?

03:59.472 --> 04:00.738
No, honey.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.940
STEFAN: Hey.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.908
I thought I heard you two.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.310
I have your Christmas present

04:05.312 --> 04:06.744
upstairs.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.479
(cheering)

04:11.651 --> 04:13.051
(sighs)

04:13.053 --> 04:14.539
They're asking for Seline?

04:14.564 --> 04:15.653
I know.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.454
She kidnapped them.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.057
I guess they didn't register the danger.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.325
No, they just keep

04:20.350 --> 04:21.993
asking for her ever
since I got them back.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.262
Well, I don't want them
thinking that she's safe.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.863
I mean, who knows when
she's just gonna show up.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.031
I, uh...

04:27.033 --> 04:27.846
I'll talk to them.

04:27.871 --> 04:30.049
No, I'll talk to them... once we leave.

04:30.074 --> 04:32.403
But we're supposed to have
Christmas together first.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.571
What is it?

04:33.573 --> 04:34.539
Did something

04:34.541 --> 04:35.740
else happen?

04:35.742 --> 04:38.276
Look, I think you'll need
to sit down for this.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.078
Ho, ho,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.546
ho!

04:41.548 --> 04:43.481
Merry Christmas, Ric.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.515
I killed you.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.417
You what?!

04:46.419 --> 04:47.552
He deserved it.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.519
Yeah, he and Matt

04:48.521 --> 04:49.954
took a whack at me.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.456
They even buried me.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.558
I can't tell you how hard it was

04:53.560 --> 04:55.193
to get all of that dirt out.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.028
(chuckles) I know.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.296
I know.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.164
Christmas just got merry.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.068
Ah, I love it.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.269
I can totally use this

05:05.271 --> 05:07.114
to keep all my papers
from blowing away.

05:07.139 --> 05:08.205
(chuckles)

05:08.230 --> 05:09.574
I'm taking you to Paris,

05:09.576 --> 05:11.109
silly witch.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.510
(squeals)

05:12.512 --> 05:14.979
(both laugh)

05:14.981 --> 05:17.782
Say the word and we're off.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.891
(cell phone ringing)

05:28.928 --> 05:31.796
(laughs)

05:31.798 --> 05:33.598
I'm sorry.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.040
I know we're late.

05:35.065 --> 05:37.068
Thank goodness. Don't come.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.669
It's Damon. He's here with that

05:38.671 --> 05:40.805
psycho <i>American Idol</i> reject.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.740
Enzo cannot be around her.

05:42.742 --> 05:43.790
And don't even get me started

05:43.814 --> 05:45.877
on what Matt and Ric just tried to pull.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.912
What do Sybil and Damon want?

05:47.914 --> 05:50.108
To ruin Christmas, I don't know.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.015
(sighs)

05:51.017 --> 05:52.450
But they promised to leave my kids alone

05:52.452 --> 05:54.419
and I don't want a war.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.087
I just hope that they leave soon.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.655
ENZO: Well, what about the tuning fork?

05:57.657 --> 05:58.677
She stole it from us.

05:58.702 --> 05:59.991
Yeah, well, let's steal it back.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.092
From where? For all we know

06:01.094 --> 06:02.126
it's in the trunk of her car.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.294
It disrupts her psychic power

06:03.296 --> 06:04.529
and it hurts like hell.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.898
She won't be carrying it around with her.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.766
It's probably stashed
where she's staying.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.001
We have no idea where that is.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.280
I can try to find out.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.937
She's not gonna just tell you.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.072
She might.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.907

Thank you.

07:06.069 --> 07:07.902
She's right.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.127
You can't fault one sibling

07:09.129 --> 07:11.229
for the sins of the other.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.296
Right?

07:12.298 --> 07:14.732
- I appreciate that.
- Stefan,

07:14.734 --> 07:16.100
why don't you come
with me and we'll go get

07:16.102 --> 07:18.503
some of the old family
tree ornaments, huh?

07:18.505 --> 07:21.372
Oh, come on, Stef.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.076
I'll tell you why I'm here.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.813
(Damon sighs)

07:30.083 --> 07:32.316
Mm.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.021
My murder, Stefan. They actually

07:37.023 --> 07:38.322
buried me in a shallow grave,

07:38.324 --> 07:39.997
not even in the family plot.

07:40.022 --> 07:42.059
Well, it's a little hard to be
sympathetic about your death

07:42.061 --> 07:43.394
when you're standing
right in front of me.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.597
Thanks to our eternal
agreement with Cade.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.533
What are you doing here?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.868
I'm getting ornaments
for the tree, Stefan.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.372
At midnight, I'm all
yours, so until then,

07:54.374 --> 07:57.041
would you just leave me alone, okay?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.877
You know, Saltzman going all

07:59.879 --> 08:03.247
crazy on me did have
an unexpected benefit.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.348
What's that?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.517
I got to hang out with
the new head honcho.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.518
Cade?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.854
The one and only.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.157
He's an interesting guy.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.525
You want time with him?

08:15.395 --> 08:18.129
Not particularly, no.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.832
Funny thing...

08:23.232 --> 08:25.046
(grunts)

08:25.071 --> 08:27.238
...he said the opposite about you.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.233
I've been waiting for you.

09:19.235 --> 09:21.335
Cade.

09:21.337 --> 09:23.671
Where are we?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.474
Just...

09:26.476 --> 09:29.076
behind the veil.

09:29.078 --> 09:30.812
So, this is hell?

09:30.814 --> 09:32.146
My living room?

09:32.148 --> 09:34.015
If this were hell,

09:34.017 --> 09:36.117
you would know it.

09:36.119 --> 09:38.352
Think of this as

09:38.354 --> 09:39.921
a waiting room.

09:39.923 --> 09:41.322
Lucky for you,

09:41.324 --> 09:43.057
I'm sending you back.

09:43.059 --> 09:46.727
But not before we
discuss our partnership.

09:46.729 --> 09:48.830
What's there to discuss?

09:48.832 --> 09:51.699
My brother and I fetch bad guys
for the rest of our existence

09:51.701 --> 09:52.800
and in exchange,

09:52.802 --> 09:54.135
you keep us out of hell.

09:54.137 --> 09:56.537
Seems pretty horrifically straightforward

09:56.539 --> 09:58.172
if you ask me.

09:58.174 --> 10:01.576
Surely, you must have questions.

10:01.578 --> 10:04.178
Just a Hail Mary pass since we're here.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.214
Why don't you let me out of this deal?

10:06.216 --> 10:08.015
I'm not the right person for you.

10:08.017 --> 10:09.650
Actually...

10:09.652 --> 10:12.019
you're the perfect person.

10:12.021 --> 10:13.488
I'm here

10:13.490 --> 10:14.856
to show you why.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.994
Mmm, this is gonna be a killer dinner.

10:19.996 --> 10:21.729
Are the other guests on the way?

10:21.731 --> 10:23.197
Let's hope so.

10:23.199 --> 10:24.432
Goody.

10:24.434 --> 10:26.100
I can't wait.

10:26.102 --> 10:30.505
I haven't had a Christmas
Eve dinner in... ever.

10:30.507 --> 10:33.307

10:33.309 --> 10:35.843
Here, here, here.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.045

10:39.626 --> 10:40.992
Besides,

10:41.017 --> 10:42.483
you wouldn't want to get

10:42.485 --> 10:44.252
turkey juice on that gigantic rock

10:44.254 --> 10:46.754
on your finger.

10:47.824 --> 10:48.856
So?

10:48.858 --> 10:50.591
When's the wedding?

10:50.593 --> 10:53.361
It was supposed to be in June,

10:53.363 --> 10:55.496
- but...
- Oh, that's right.

10:55.498 --> 10:57.298
Cade. Hmm.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.700
Don't worry. A vampire like Stefan

10:59.702 --> 11:01.168
will be really good.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.371
He can probably kill 12 people

11:03.373 --> 11:04.572
in two seconds...

11:04.574 --> 11:06.774
(gulps)

11:06.776 --> 11:09.377
...and still be home in
time to draw you a bath.

11:09.379 --> 11:11.579
Thrilling.

11:11.581 --> 11:15.449

about Mystic Falls so far?

11:15.451 --> 11:17.218
Hmm...

11:17.220 --> 11:19.720
Huge houses with big pools.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.522
You know I love the water,

11:21.524 --> 11:23.991
and it's not like I have to
pay the mortgage or anything.

11:23.993 --> 11:27.194
It's hard to find those around here.

11:27.196 --> 11:28.729
Actually, there's a little neighborhood

11:28.731 --> 11:30.097
outside of Grove Hill

11:30.099 --> 11:32.800
called the Pond Estates.

11:33.356 --> 11:34.922

11:34.947 --> 11:36.437
there's no pond.

11:36.439 --> 11:39.073
(laughs) I know, right?

11:39.075 --> 11:43.077
Anyway, it's filled with rich, sleazy men

11:43.079 --> 11:46.447
that'll give up their
whole house for a song.

12:01.664 --> 12:03.464
the Pond Estates.

12:03.466 --> 12:04.899
It's somewhere outside of Grove Hill.

19:56.259 --> 19:57.992
DAMON: You know, at least Ric

19:57.994 --> 20:00.662
looked a little torn up when
that stake went in my heart.

20:00.664 --> 20:02.530
And you looked pretty psyched.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.699
But I forgive you, Mattie.

20:04.701 --> 20:07.101
You've had a lot of tragedy in your life.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.138
Here's the deal. Ric was just doing

20:10.140 --> 20:11.773
the parental thing, much like what

20:11.775 --> 20:13.608
he's doing upstairs right now.

20:13.610 --> 20:14.909
Do I want to kill him?

20:14.911 --> 20:16.695
Yes, but that's personal.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.913
This should be principle.

20:18.915 --> 20:20.982
It's all personal, Damon.

20:20.984 --> 20:22.650
SYBIL: What about this...

20:22.652 --> 20:24.419
Peter fellow?

20:25.555 --> 20:27.155
I've heard so so much about you.

20:27.157 --> 20:28.756
Back off.

20:28.758 --> 20:30.959
Or what?

20:30.961 --> 20:32.460
- Bonnie?
- SELINE: Don't hang up.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.429
Bonnie and Enzo are here with me.

20:34.431 --> 20:37.131
They're in no danger.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.400
We're fine, Ric. Seline
just wants to talk to you.

20:39.402 --> 20:42.003
She won't give us the weapon
unless we got you on the phone.

20:42.005 --> 20:43.605
What the hell do you have to say?

20:43.607 --> 20:44.906
Your children need my help.

20:44.908 --> 20:47.108
My children are just fine.

20:47.110 --> 20:49.112
And you're never gonna come
around them ever again.

20:49.137 --> 20:50.011
I have to.

20:50.013 --> 20:51.846
I need to fix what I started.

20:51.848 --> 20:53.481
I was giving them training,

20:53.483 --> 20:56.184
preparing them for Cade.
That left a psychic imprint.

20:56.186 --> 20:57.585
If I don't remove that imprint,

20:57.587 --> 21:00.121
they will always be linked to me.

21:00.123 --> 21:01.889
They must be showing signs of it by now.

21:01.891 --> 21:05.426
Look, I did what you asked,
and I got on the phone.

21:05.428 --> 21:06.527
Now it's your turn.

21:06.529 --> 21:08.630
Give my friends what they need.

21:08.632 --> 21:10.632
Alaric, I'm not who you think I am.

21:10.634 --> 21:12.967
I have been trying to escape for years.

21:12.969 --> 21:14.802
Then do us all a favor.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.571
And drop dead.

21:16.573 --> 21:18.373
(sighs)

21:19.142 --> 21:22.343
Something nice and easy, Tammy.

21:22.345 --> 21:26.571
♪ O holy night... ♪

21:26.596 --> 21:28.922
If that's your Christmas list,
then you better get cracking.

21:28.946 --> 21:31.686
Sadly, it's not that kind of list.

21:31.688 --> 21:33.354
Georgie Dowling?

21:33.356 --> 21:34.822
Ric's intern?

21:34.824 --> 21:37.091
She's the last person I killed.

21:38.228 --> 21:40.628
It's reverse chronological order.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.286
The names were

21:42.311 --> 21:43.931
a habit I picked up along the way.

21:43.933 --> 21:46.834
Where'd you pick that up, exactly?

21:48.872 --> 21:50.638
<i>In Monterey.</i>

21:50.640 --> 21:53.641
STEFAN: I don't remember doing this.

21:53.643 --> 21:55.843
Recognize him?

22:08.558 --> 22:12.026
CADE: That you showed
remorse meant nothing to me.

22:13.930 --> 22:16.264
But for some reason,

22:16.266 --> 22:17.932
it did to her.

22:37.034 --> 22:39.635
Does this jog your memory?

22:54.018 --> 22:57.653
Who are they? Your victims?

22:58.522 --> 22:59.855
Leave...

22:59.857 --> 23:01.768
or you'll go up there next.

23:01.793 --> 23:04.092
You are too exhausted to hurt me.

23:05.930 --> 23:10.265
(humming)

23:12.603 --> 23:14.803
You will rest now.

23:14.805 --> 23:17.472
In torment.

23:18.609 --> 23:21.410
My master has claimed your soul.

23:25.249 --> 23:26.882
(yelling)

23:26.884 --> 23:29.618
Stefan Salvatore?

23:29.620 --> 23:30.852
Are you sure?

23:30.854 --> 23:32.487
Positive.

23:32.489 --> 23:36.391
I had every intention of eating his flesh.

23:36.393 --> 23:38.360
I had ripped apart so many others

23:38.362 --> 23:39.695
but none of them massacred

23:39.697 --> 23:42.297
an entire work camp on Christmas Eve.

23:43.410 --> 23:45.334
Ironic, huh?

23:45.336 --> 23:46.835
What made you spare him?

23:46.837 --> 23:50.505
When I looked into his mind,

23:50.507 --> 23:52.975
I didn't see evil.

23:52.977 --> 23:55.944
I only saw anguish.

23:55.946 --> 23:57.112
(gasps)

23:58.515 --> 24:01.316
You can see inside my mind, can't you?

24:01.318 --> 24:03.051
It's horrible, isn't it?

24:03.053 --> 24:04.486
I know.

24:04.488 --> 24:05.787
Take me. I deserve it.

24:05.789 --> 24:07.022
Yes, you do.

24:07.024 --> 24:09.224
I was made into a Ripper who craves blood

24:09.226 --> 24:10.525
all day and all night.

24:10.527 --> 24:12.728
Kill me. Do it.

24:12.730 --> 24:14.830
Please.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.466
(sighs)

24:17.468 --> 24:19.801
(gasping)

24:19.803 --> 24:22.337
I saw a man who was innocent,

24:22.339 --> 24:24.439
had loved,

24:24.441 --> 24:27.042
and then had to become
a monster to survive.

24:29.179 --> 24:32.280
<i>That's a story I know all too well.</i>

24:32.883 --> 24:34.750
<i>Maybe he deserved Cade's wrath,</i>

24:34.752 --> 24:38.253
<i>but I no longer wanted
to be the one to decide.</i>

24:44.094 --> 24:46.128
She took the memory away.

24:46.130 --> 24:48.030
CADE: She altered your
subconscious enough

24:48.032 --> 24:49.765
that you forgot on your own.

24:49.767 --> 24:54.236
Made me believe I was worthy of a life.

24:54.238 --> 24:56.071
Yeah.

24:56.073 --> 24:58.273
Weak.

24:58.275 --> 25:00.475
I knew I had lost her.

25:00.477 --> 25:04.279
But it piqued my interest... in you.

25:05.115 --> 25:07.516
You're a savage killer

25:07.518 --> 25:10.419
who escaped fate and
turned my best servant

25:10.421 --> 25:11.987
into a mush of remorse.

25:11.989 --> 25:14.589
That combination

25:14.591 --> 25:16.691
makes you valuable.

25:16.693 --> 25:18.860
That's why I jumped at the opportunity

25:18.862 --> 25:21.563
to have you as my new servant.

25:21.565 --> 25:24.032
You...

25:24.034 --> 25:27.669
a coldhearted killing machine,

25:27.671 --> 25:29.371
instead of some reluctant girl

25:29.373 --> 25:31.606
who found morality a hundred years ago.

25:31.608 --> 25:33.275
I will never...

25:33.277 --> 25:34.509
be that Ripper again.

25:34.511 --> 25:37.112
Not for you.

25:37.114 --> 25:38.380
Not anyone.

25:38.382 --> 25:41.283
I'm disappointed to hear it.

25:41.285 --> 25:43.919
Hmm. That Ripper

25:43.921 --> 25:47.122
is exactly what I want in a servant.

25:50.060 --> 25:52.461
One more stop.

26:02.439 --> 26:04.439
All I wanted was a way out.

26:06.276 --> 26:08.143
I always wanted to be mortal.

26:09.279 --> 26:10.645
To be free.

26:11.748 --> 26:14.449
But now, when I die,

26:14.451 --> 26:16.785
Cade will torture my soul in hell.

26:18.589 --> 26:21.189
Because my sister sold me out.

26:23.293 --> 26:26.361
Redemption is the only chance I have.

26:28.632 --> 26:29.798
(tuning fork clinks)

26:32.369 --> 26:34.669
If Alaric loves his daughters,

26:35.639 --> 26:38.807
he will bring them to see me.

26:41.745 --> 26:43.778
We'll relay the message.

26:46.383 --> 26:48.116
Can't promise results.

26:49.553 --> 26:52.521
The path to forgiveness begins
with one step, right?

26:53.790 --> 26:56.124
Thank you.

26:58.095 --> 26:59.394
PETER: I told you.

26:59.396 --> 27:00.662
I gambled away lots of money.

27:00.664 --> 27:02.429
I cheated on my taxes for sure.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.633
I don't know what else you want to know.

27:04.635 --> 27:06.501
Well, look who decided to join us.

27:06.503 --> 27:07.636
I was just asking Peter what's

27:07.638 --> 27:09.404
the worst thing he's ever done.

27:09.406 --> 27:11.306
Oh, well, mine was not making sure you

27:11.308 --> 27:12.807
that you were permanently dead.

27:12.809 --> 27:15.477
I see you're wreaking havoc as usual.

27:15.479 --> 27:17.679
Damon, drop this stupid game.

27:17.681 --> 27:21.416
Oh, but humiliating public
confession is so fun.

27:21.418 --> 27:22.551
You left your son.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.052
You abandoned your family.

27:24.054 --> 27:26.588
And your answer to the question
what's the worst thing

27:26.590 --> 27:27.422
you've ever done is...

27:27.424 --> 27:28.356
(imitating Peter): "Uh,

27:28.358 --> 27:29.791
"I guess I gambled and cheated

27:29.793 --> 27:31.526
on account of my dishonesty."

27:31.528 --> 27:32.561
I was a kid.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.762
Well, unless your last name is Pan,

27:33.764 --> 27:35.964
you haven't been a kid for a long time.

27:35.966 --> 27:38.867
So, explain to me

27:38.869 --> 27:41.036
the last 20-plus years.

27:41.038 --> 27:42.571
None of your business, Damon.

27:43.646 --> 27:46.066
Enough! Enough.

27:46.091 --> 27:48.076
This has gone way too far.

27:48.078 --> 27:49.544
You do not need to answer him.

27:53.025 --> 27:54.893
Yes you do. And quick.

27:54.918 --> 27:56.451
(yells)

27:56.453 --> 27:58.520
Next cut goes a couple inches lower.

27:58.522 --> 27:59.875
What are you gonna do, Donovan?

27:59.900 --> 28:00.822
Kill me again?

28:00.824 --> 28:02.123
Let's hear Papa's story

28:02.125 --> 28:03.725
while he still has some vocal cords.

28:03.727 --> 28:05.660
Last chance.

28:05.662 --> 28:09.331
What kept you away
for more than 20 years?

28:09.333 --> 28:12.100
It was shame, okay? Just look, I was...

28:12.102 --> 28:13.868
I was ashamed.

28:13.870 --> 28:15.937
Kelly was pregnant again and I...

28:15.939 --> 28:18.240
I couldn't come back and
be another toilet scrubber

28:18.242 --> 28:20.775
in this town, I had...

28:20.777 --> 28:22.244
I had to get out.

28:22.246 --> 28:24.980
(breathing heavily)

28:24.982 --> 28:27.082
DAMON: Wow.

28:27.084 --> 28:28.917
It's worse than I thought.

28:28.919 --> 28:30.885
He didn't have a reason at all.

28:34.324 --> 28:36.324
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:37.329 --> 28:38.662
we have a winner.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.555
(school bell rings)

28:48.739 --> 28:50.205
Why are we here?

28:50.207 --> 28:53.842
CADE: This is moments
before you first met her,

28:53.844 --> 28:55.577
literally ran into her.

28:56.914 --> 28:58.380
Elena.

28:58.382 --> 29:01.103
If only you had never
come down this hallway,

29:01.128 --> 29:02.651
we might not be together now.

29:02.653 --> 29:03.785
This was from a chapter in my life

29:03.787 --> 29:05.220
when I was good.

29:05.222 --> 29:06.314
I loved her.

29:06.339 --> 29:08.624
She already had enough
tragedy in her life.

29:08.626 --> 29:10.959
You just had to insert yourself.

29:10.961 --> 29:13.695
All because you "had to know her."

29:13.697 --> 29:17.533
You took a good girl whose life
was headed down the right path

29:17.535 --> 29:20.936
and you veered her right into the median.

29:20.938 --> 29:23.639
That was never my intention.

29:23.641 --> 29:25.274
I tried to protect her.

29:25.276 --> 29:26.909
Never meeting her...

29:26.911 --> 29:28.343
was the only way to protect her.

29:28.345 --> 29:32.381
But instead, you chose a total stranger

29:32.383 --> 29:35.250
and turned her into something dark.

29:35.252 --> 29:38.087
(school bell rings)

29:39.990 --> 29:42.070
Well, I can't take that back, can I?

29:42.793 --> 29:45.727
But you can do it again.

29:45.729 --> 29:47.930
For me.

29:47.932 --> 29:49.665
Find people that would get into the place

29:49.667 --> 29:52.134
with pearly gates by an inch,

29:52.136 --> 29:55.270
and make them into folks
that would miss it by a mile.

29:55.272 --> 29:57.114
Like Elena.

29:57.139 --> 29:58.874
Help me gather what I need.

29:58.876 --> 30:00.809
But Elena is a good person.

30:00.811 --> 30:03.078
I thought you needed evil people.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.747
Good people who can be made wicked.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.150
They are evil

30:08.152 --> 30:10.586
at their core.

30:10.588 --> 30:12.554
Their souls are unusually potent.

30:13.872 --> 30:17.340
Those are the ones I want
to feed on most of all.

30:18.529 --> 30:21.163
I'm so sorry about your face.

30:21.165 --> 30:22.598
Me?

30:22.600 --> 30:26.235
I prefer to catch my flies with honey.

30:26.237 --> 30:27.669
See, Damon

30:27.671 --> 30:30.272
came here to give something,

30:30.274 --> 30:32.774
but I came here to get something.

30:32.776 --> 30:35.444
So, where is it?

30:36.347 --> 30:38.680
Whatever you want,
look, I-I don't have it.

30:38.682 --> 30:40.115
Lies.

30:40.117 --> 30:41.884
Lady, I have no idea

30:41.886 --> 30:43.185
what you're talking about.

30:43.187 --> 30:44.486
All you need to know

30:44.488 --> 30:46.255
is that you have something I need,

30:46.257 --> 30:47.923
and you will give it to me.

30:47.925 --> 30:50.592
(yelling)

30:50.594 --> 30:52.694
I wouldn't.

30:54.265 --> 30:56.165
(door opens, closes)

30:56.167 --> 30:57.967
(yelling)

30:57.992 --> 31:00.202
Simple mind, where is it?

31:00.204 --> 31:01.904
(Peter groaning)

31:01.906 --> 31:04.106
- (tuning fork ringing)
- (gasping)

31:05.376 --> 31:06.642
Are you all right, love?

31:06.644 --> 31:09.378
(groaning)

31:15.352 --> 31:17.452
You've taken too much of my time.

31:17.454 --> 31:18.854
I suppose.

31:18.856 --> 31:21.156
Especially considering
I have forever with you.

31:21.158 --> 31:22.891
And if I refuse?

31:23.894 --> 31:26.662
I suddenly become patient enough

31:26.664 --> 31:29.531
to wait for those kids upstairs

31:29.533 --> 31:31.333
to come of age.

31:36.106 --> 31:40.342
And what if you don't have to be patient?

31:40.344 --> 31:42.911
What if I can get the job done...

31:42.913 --> 31:44.613
faster?

31:45.749 --> 31:47.316
"Faster"?

31:48.686 --> 31:50.018
How?

31:50.020 --> 31:52.120
I could become the Ripper that you want.

31:52.122 --> 31:55.357
I'd be more effective that way.

31:55.359 --> 31:57.459
I wouldn't be held back by my emotions.

31:57.461 --> 31:59.228
You'd turn your humanity off?

31:59.230 --> 32:00.862
For a short time, yes.

32:00.864 --> 32:04.433
And then after, when it's over,

32:04.435 --> 32:06.435
you let me and my brother go.

32:09.039 --> 32:12.040
When I was the Ripper...

32:12.042 --> 32:14.710
I was one of a kind.

32:14.712 --> 32:19.047
No one can do what I do.

32:21.685 --> 32:23.252
One year.

32:24.955 --> 32:29.791

32:29.793 --> 32:32.227
will never tire of this work.

32:32.229 --> 32:35.631
I predict that, after a year with me,

32:35.633 --> 32:38.767
you won't want to leave.
