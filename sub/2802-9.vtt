PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar…

00:03.712 --> 00:05.506
-Who is that?
-Agent Garrett Fowler.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.799
NEAL: I give you the box,
Kate and I never hear from you again.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.510
Alex.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.762
Here. I don't need all the heat
this is gonna bring.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.891
MOZZIE: <i>I deciphered the phone number</i>
<i>that Kate dialed</i><i>from the plane.</i>

00:17.935 --> 00:20.521
I traced it
to a store-bought burner phone.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.814
-So no names associated with it?
-Not yet.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.900
Whatever this thing's hiding,
it's not the music.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.193
PETER: I think it's a keyhole.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.861
-A key to what?
-Mmm.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.490
That's the last piece of the music box.
I'm giving up my obsession.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.991
You're suggesting I give up mine?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.451
DIANA: Marshals monitor the anklet.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.954
Yes, one of these keys
goes to your anklet.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.123
I know who Kate called from the plane.

00:40.207 --> 00:44.336
It was the FBI agent
who set up the deal between you and Kate.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.089
Garrett Fowler. Now I need to find him.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.558
-Is this a good idea?
-You have a better one?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.893
PETER: No.
Do you think Mozzie can do this?

00:59.977 --> 01:02.145
Oh, he's a savant
when it comes to things like this.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.690
<i>-Rain Man,</i> I get it.
-You should see him with a Rubik's cube.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.110
-Probably can do it with his feet, right?
-Thirty seconds, socks on or off.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.029
Oh. This is the single
greatest day of his life.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.907
Yup. All the conspiracy theories
have come true.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.787
We've been so close

01:18.871 --> 01:21.707
and now we finally meet.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.417
-I told you.
-I agreed with you.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.543
Shush!

01:24.626 --> 01:27.087
No, there's no shushing.
No shushing for you.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.922
You ready to record this?

01:29.006 --> 01:31.383
Yes, but first walk me through it.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.928
All right, pay attention.
This is where it gets good.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.015
We noticed this broken piece
wasn't broken.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.975
-It's a keyhole.
-Yeah.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.103
This is the key.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.655
-There's a second comb.
-NEAL: Yep.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.491
-We snap it into place.
-PETER: You ready?

01:57.242 --> 01:58.452
Yeah.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.081
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

02:07.044 --> 02:09.171
Any idea of what kind of code it is?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.965
Sounds could correspond
with numbers, wavelengths.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.384
Pala's discovery of hidden
music in <i>The Last Supper.</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:16.512
<i>RuneScape's</i> encoded flute solo.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.888
Don't forget <i>Close Encounters.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.599
Geographical coordinates encoded…

02:20.682 --> 02:23.310
-BOTH: In five tones.
-Very good, Suit.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.687
-Clearly, we're in good hands.
-Yeah.

02:28.023 --> 02:31.151
-What are you doing?
-Getting this out of harm's way.

02:31.235 --> 02:34.738
-And I am keeping this.
-That's a good idea.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.407
We defang the box,
we can use it to lure out Fowler.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.912
No way. Tomorrow, you and me,
it's back to business as usual.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.873
-Yeah.
-Oh, business as usual.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.500
Us without the box.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.919
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

02:51.797 --> 02:54.007
-How old is this code?
-Hard to say.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.553
The last credible report
has the box disappearing

02:57.636 --> 02:59.721
from Königsberg Castle in '45.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.516
Now, assuming
no one has reunited the cherub

03:02.599 --> 03:03.767
and the box since then…

03:03.851 --> 03:05.060
Wait, wait.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.939
The box and the key were together
the day we stole it.

03:09.815 --> 03:10.983
Alex.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.819
She had 'em both
before she brought the box back to me.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.448
Well, she obviously inserted the key
and found the comb.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.659
So why'd she give it back?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.828
Couldn't solve it herself?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.580
Or she took something out of it.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.415
Or she knows something we don't.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.834
-She could be a step ahead of us.
-Yeah.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.880
We really should talk to her.
It's too bad she disappeared to Italy.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.131
Maybe.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.801
You know where Alex is, don't you?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.136
I have an idea.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.931
How did Mozzie do?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.683
Better than I expected.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.894
I'm convinced he's the cherub for the job.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.563
And what about Neal?
How's he doing with all this?

03:50.397 --> 03:53.192
I don't know
if he's interested in the music box.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.068
I think he just wants to find Fowler.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.820
See what he knows about Kate's death.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.032
Well, speaking of Fowler,
we got a blip on the radar.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.119
An old bank account.
Someone checked the balance.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.287
-Did you trace it?
-No.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.622
It was done remotely.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.415
Two hundred bucks in the account?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.459
Yeah, he emptied his accounts
when he went underground,

04:10.542 --> 04:11.585
but he didn't get much.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.587
Maybe he's desperate for cash.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.422
What are you thinking?

04:15.506 --> 04:16.965
Do you know about his wife's death?

04:17.049 --> 04:19.259
She was killed during a robbery
a few years ago.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.470
Yeah, when he was working
Violent Crimes for the Bureau.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.348
Suspicious circumstances
surrounded her murder.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.309
That kept the insurance company
from finalizing their claim.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.395
We could make it look like
the claim finally came through.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.272
Put a stack of cash in the account.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.775
If he bites, we can track the withdrawal.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.859
In the meantime,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.986
-make sure that stays safe.
-Hmm.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.503
MOZZIE: What bushes did you rustle
to uncover Alex's trail?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.839
Remember that silver collection
she fenced a few years ago.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.383
The Spanish pieces from
the <i>Almiranta</i> shipwreck?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.760
They're popping up again, one at a time.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.430
-Hale.
-I don't like loitering.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.561
Neal. (CHUCKLES)

05:11.728 --> 05:13.230
I really appreciate this.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.400
So, what happened to the goatee?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.235
You know I liked it.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.237
-We all grow up.
-All children.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.531
Except one.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.283
-(CHUCKLES)
-You bring it?

05:35.127 --> 05:37.337
-It's from the <i>Almiranta.</i>
-Who's the fence?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.091
-Anonymous.
-The thief?

05:41.175 --> 05:45.888
It's the third piece of shipwreck silver
I've had come through this month.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.056
-Someone's been busy.
-Too busy.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.058
HALE: I like that someone.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.270
So you should warn her
the NYPD's on the trail.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.022
If they make the <i>Almiranta</i> connection…

05:55.105 --> 05:56.356
Understood.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.902
What do I owe you for this?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.779
Man, we all go way back.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.073
Just remember me fondly
when you pull the next job.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.202
-Well, that might be awhile.
-Or it might not.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.167
MOZZIE: He thinks it's Alex.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.127
She knows how valuable the stuff is.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.587
And she knows where it is.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.756
She's stealing back her own stuff.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.383
When NYPD realizes
it's all from the same collection…

06:23.467 --> 06:25.928
-They'll set a trap.
-Unless we get to her first.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.223
That would take FBI resources
we don't have access to.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.601
I can get those.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.727
How?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.647
I con the FBI.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.525
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

06:51.954 --> 06:54.790
Peter said it's time
to get back to business as usual.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.500
Following standard Peter protocol,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.169
that means he'll try to pull
from the reserve of active case files,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.879
which I'm allowed to take home and peruse.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.881
Exhibits A, I presume?

07:02.965 --> 07:05.092
Yes, they range from mortgage fraud

07:05.175 --> 07:07.177
to copyright infringement,
back to mortgage fraud.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.971
-Sorry, I just dozed off.
-I know.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.932
But Peter always
tries to find a diamond in the rough.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.018
So you wanna
create a diamond for him to find?

07:15.102 --> 07:18.272
Exactly. If we can forge a case file
linking the silver thefts,

07:18.355 --> 07:19.523
he won't be able to resist it.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.818
And then he'll think
he found the case himself.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.111
It's brilliant.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.238
-Hello, hello.

started coming in,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.805
we know Alex's MO, and I created this.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.099
You named Alex the Silver Burglar?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.435
All right,
I admit it lacks a certain flair,

07:56.518 --> 07:57.728
but it makes the point.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.855
It includes a police report
for the stolen items,

07:59.938 --> 08:02.733
and I've added just enough FBI research
to connect the dots.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.570

to have been floating around the Bureau.

But this is interesting.

39:39.296 --> 39:41.965
Surveillance tape
was queued up to some earlier footage.

39:42.049 --> 39:44.760
-Neal.
-He's the next target.

39:45.928 --> 39:47.221
What the hell's going on?

39:47.304 --> 39:48.722
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:57.731 --> 40:00.317
Hi, Neal, can I come in?

40:01.318 --> 40:04.071
(SIGHS) Sure, come on in.

40:10.452 --> 40:11.453
Neal, pick up.

40:12.454 --> 40:13.580
Keep trying.

40:15.832 --> 40:19.253
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-You gonna answer that?

40:19.336 --> 40:20.504
No.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.802
Is the target officially off my back?

40:26.885 --> 40:29.054
Whoever wants the box
knows you don't have it now.

40:29.137 --> 40:32.015
Well, it'll be nice to stop
prowling around rooftops for a paycheck.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.767
-(CHUCKLES)
-What about you?

40:33.851 --> 40:35.477
Did you get what you need?

40:35.561 --> 40:38.689
I found Fowler,
but I still don't know who killed Kate.

40:39.356 --> 40:41.567
-And the code?
-Mozz will crack it.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.363
I chased that music box
for a long time, Neal.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.073
I almost feel guilty I brought you in.

40:48.156 --> 40:49.741
Oh, come on, I forced my way in.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.785
-True, but that's just…
-What we do.

40:53.203 --> 40:56.623
It's kind of sad,
it's all coming to an end.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.879
Freeze. Hands where I can see them.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.176
May I?

41:11.180 --> 41:12.472
My number.

41:13.473 --> 41:15.017
From now on I'll answer it.

41:15.684 --> 41:16.977
See you around, Neal.

41:19.855 --> 41:21.732
Thought we sent you to Italy, Alex.

41:22.691 --> 41:26.445
-Snuck back in.
-You are quick on your feet, like a cat.

41:28.030 --> 41:30.699
That silver around your neck,
Spanish by chance?

41:30.782 --> 41:32.075
Don't know.

41:34.828 --> 41:35.871
See you around.

41:43.045 --> 41:44.630
You wanna explain the guns?

41:44.713 --> 41:46.840
Someone killed Akihiro Tanaka.

41:46.924 --> 41:48.717
We thought they were headed here next.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.802
-Why?
-Surveillance tapes

41:50.886 --> 41:54.014
at the antique shop paused on your image.

41:54.097 --> 41:56.058
Well, I wasn't there alone.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.282
(MUFFLED GUNSHOT)

42:18.539 --> 42:19.665
Sir.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.043
Are you okay? What happened?

42:26.046 --> 42:27.214
Have a great day.
