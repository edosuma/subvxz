00:00.200 --> 00:02.300
Previously on "Turn"...

00:04.104 --> 00:05.504
Easy! Easy!

00:06.379 --> 00:07.879
Are you suggesting poison?

00:07.976 --> 00:10.176
Someone was trying to kill you, sir.

00:11.541 --> 00:12.141
Ah!

00:12.225 --> 00:13.925
Father! Father!

00:14.561 --> 00:16.861
Your father's been arrested, Ben.

00:16.882 --> 00:18.882
<i>- My father?
- And Lucas Brewster, too.</i>

00:19.209 --> 00:20.409
The charges are false.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.266
Simcoe has created the threat.

00:22.317 --> 00:24.517
All I have to do is present the case

00:24.674 --> 00:25.674
and then just see it fall apart.

00:26.297 --> 00:27.397
You're planning to lose?

00:27.642 --> 00:29.042
Do you have a better idea?

00:29.069 --> 00:31.269
Gather those loyal, raid the armory,

00:31.335 --> 00:32.335
storm the church, and...

00:32.433 --> 00:34.133
Then we bring the war here to Setauket?

00:34.213 --> 00:35.513
The war is already here!

00:39.871 --> 00:41.271
I left town to cheat the hangman.

00:41.782 --> 00:43.082
I doubt the rest will be so lucky.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.278
We're going home.

00:58.018 --> 01:00.692
<i>(fire crackling)</i>

01:23.799 --> 01:27.306
"729, Setauket.

01:29.179 --> 01:34.191
711, General Washington.

01:41.912 --> 01:45.922
725, C. Brewster."

01:50.367 --> 01:53.073
(men chatting)

01:55.949 --> 01:58.187
Four out of seven ain't bad.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.727
- Do you think they got lost?
- No, Selah knows his way.

02:01.761 --> 02:04.233
<i>Could be they caught a swell up
near Mastic and wound up there.</i>

02:04.267 --> 02:06.071
- Then we wait for them.
- Bullshit. You wait.

02:06.105 --> 02:07.776
I'm gonna get my uncle
before they hang him.

02:07.810 --> 02:09.481
Nobody's getting hanged at midnight.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.017
We wait for the rest of the unit

02:11.051 --> 02:13.858
and then we take them
by surprise, all of us.

02:13.893 --> 02:16.331
My father's in that cellar, too, you know.

02:21.044 --> 02:23.349
<i>(door opens)</i>

02:23.383 --> 02:25.054
(gasps)

02:38.055 --> 02:41.731
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

02:45.809 --> 02:48.080
You send Luke and Jeremiah to Whitehall?

02:49.842 --> 02:51.948
Aberdeen needed extra hands.

02:51.952 --> 02:53.354
She's attending to your father's health

02:53.415 --> 02:55.419
<i>and doesn't have time for the house.</i>

03:00.394 --> 03:02.264
I thought you were attending to him.

03:02.299 --> 03:04.637
His wish was that I returned here.

03:04.671 --> 03:07.244
I'm sorry if that upsets you.

03:08.781 --> 03:10.919
What do you mean?

03:12.912 --> 03:15.250
Mary, what's wrong?

03:20.598 --> 03:23.907
I'm afraid.

03:25.511 --> 03:26.781
Of what?

03:26.815 --> 03:30.122
You know.

03:32.931 --> 03:35.971
The traitors here in
Setauket, hiding in secret,

03:36.006 --> 03:37.709
<i>plotting to kill us.</i>

03:37.744 --> 03:41.084
<i>The men who shot your father.</i>

03:41.119 --> 03:43.256
Now listen to me.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.262
I'm gonna tell you something
that you can't repeat

03:45.296 --> 03:47.434
to anyone else, and I mean it this time.

03:47.468 --> 03:50.275
If you whisper this like
you did the gravestones,

03:50.309 --> 03:54.185
there will be a price
to pay for both of us.

03:55.589 --> 03:58.329
Captain Simcoe shot my father.

04:00.035 --> 04:01.704
What?

04:01.740 --> 04:04.780
He used an accomplice. Not sure who it was.

04:04.814 --> 04:07.519
I don't think he cared if
my father lived or died,

04:07.553 --> 04:10.494
just as long as he
hanged a Tallmadge for it.

04:12.935 --> 04:14.906
This is wrong.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.810
Well, Mary, it's the truth, so...

04:16.845 --> 04:19.785
What about the petition that
Tallmadge and the others signed?

04:19.820 --> 04:21.355
The one that you prosecuted them for?

04:21.390 --> 04:23.929
All the petition says is
that they believe in liberty.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.937
I took the case on with
the aim to prove that.

04:26.972 --> 04:29.576
You lied to everyone

04:29.611 --> 04:32.150
Didn't you just
hear what I...

04:33.890 --> 04:35.994
Fine. That's just fine, then.

04:36.028 --> 04:38.733
<i>Now that... no, now that you
know, you can go make it right.</i>

04:38.768 --> 04:40.672
No, go tell Hewlett. Go
and get that ruling reversed

04:40.706 --> 04:42.443
so you can see all of those men hanged.

04:42.478 --> 04:44.113
- I wouldn't do that.
- No, of course you wouldn't

04:44.147 --> 04:45.380
because then you'd be
the wife of a traitor.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.382
And you would be hanged for treason.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.185
(scoffs) Treason?

04:50.220 --> 04:52.354
Is that truly how you see it?

04:52.388 --> 04:55.124
- Yes, that's the law.
- And is that what you believe?

04:55.158 --> 04:56.526
<i>Huh? Tell me.</i>

04:56.560 --> 04:58.467
Tell me what you believe in.

04:58.521 --> 05:00.758
I believe in family.

05:00.892 --> 05:03.863
I believe that a husband
should live with his wife,

05:03.897 --> 05:06.366
should lay with his wife if he's able to,

05:06.400 --> 05:08.769
and if he's not, then
be truthful about why.

05:08.803 --> 05:10.471
You don't think that I'm able?

05:10.506 --> 05:12.975
Well, I haven't had any
proof since the winter.

05:13.009 --> 05:16.112
I assume you've been proving it elsewhere.

05:16.147 --> 05:18.715
Just another thing that you've been hiding.

05:20.117 --> 05:22.787
You want proof?

05:25.090 --> 05:28.860
I wouldn't want to force you.
You might not believe in it.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.170
(breathing heavily)

05:41.108 --> 05:44.510
Are you sure you don't want
to drink something first?

05:46.013 --> 05:49.082
<i>(fabric rips)</i>

05:56.324 --> 05:58.826
This is Baker's bed.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.761
This is my house.

06:00.796 --> 06:02.863
Prove it.

Good morning.

06:50.934 --> 06:53.035
Morning.

06:55.438 --> 06:57.139
What are you doing?

06:57.173 --> 06:59.508
Riding into town with you.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.243
You have to buy seed for replanting

07:01.277 --> 07:03.312
and I have a house to get back in order.

07:03.346 --> 07:06.148
We'll spend the whole
day together, hmm, Thomas?

07:24.234 --> 07:26.939
- Sun's up.
- Not yet.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.175
Ben, the sun's up and we
still outnumber Hewlett.

07:29.309 --> 07:31.277
Even with this lot.

07:31.311 --> 07:32.912
All right.

<i>Get down.</i>

07:36.617 --> 07:37.984
<i>Ready firelocks.</i>

07:43.090 --> 07:45.858
It's William Blaine and his son Tom.

07:54.568 --> 07:57.303
(sighs) Now they come.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.774
Caleb, he's only a boy.

08:01.808 --> 08:03.843
Those are fishing rods, not muskets.

08:03.877 --> 08:05.211
Getting soft, are we?

08:05.245 --> 08:08.113
What? Caleb!

08:11.418 --> 08:13.252
(grunts)

08:13.286 --> 08:15.454
- Hi, Bill.
- Run, Tom! Run!

<i>- Ben: Parsons.
- Yes, sir.</i>

08:29.903 --> 08:31.770
Wait until they beach, then fall in.

08:31.804 --> 08:34.673
You take the north hill,
we'll take the flank.

08:34.707 --> 08:37.509
We march!

08:50.156 --> 08:52.424
No need to alter the ship. I like it.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.927
Just change the first three letters.

09:00.533 --> 09:02.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:11.944 --> 09:15.346
Hey, careful now. Slow down.

09:19.084 --> 09:22.153
He says the rebels took his
dear old dad down by the cove

09:22.187 --> 09:23.988
and they'll come for us next.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.723
<i>Tom: Ships and soldiers,
hundreds of them.</i>

09:25.758 --> 09:28.559
- Or 500 of them.
- (Soldier laughs)

09:28.594 --> 09:30.161
It's true.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.231
I saw Benjamin Tallmadge
all done up in blue and gold.

09:49.915 --> 09:52.450
Open it.

10:04.496 --> 10:05.963
Cut them down.

10:05.997 --> 10:08.699
Soldier: You sure? Just
gonna string them up again.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.534
<i>Maybe we shoot them right here.</i>

10:10.568 --> 10:12.703
We'll likely need our ammunition today,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.638
and I want Captain Tallmadge

10:14.672 --> 10:17.307
to see his father swing from the gallows.

10:17.342 --> 10:20.077
It's an image I've had in
my head for quite a while.

10:20.111 --> 10:22.246
My son?
How...

10:22.280 --> 10:24.248
(grunts)

10:26.417 --> 10:30.520
Ensign, you are to ride to Sag
Harbor and inform Colonel Floyd

10:30.555 --> 10:33.190
that we are under attack
and request reinforcements,

10:33.224 --> 10:35.025
preferably along with the armed vessel

10:35.059 --> 10:37.461
we so graciously loaned him
in order to ship his tobacco.

10:37.495 --> 10:39.329
- Yes, Major.
- Go!

10:42.667 --> 10:45.302
Richard, what are you doing out of bed?

10:45.336 --> 10:47.671
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no, nonsense.

10:47.705 --> 10:50.874
You've already taken a wound
in service to the crown.

10:50.908 --> 10:52.776
It is now time for me to defend Setauket

10:52.810 --> 10:54.811
from those who wish to defile her.

10:54.845 --> 10:58.448
I knew this day was coming
and I am ready, my old friend.

10:58.482 --> 11:00.650
I want to meet my
enemy face-to-face.

11:00.684 --> 11:02.585
You must protect Whitehall.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.088
It's sure to be a target of this raid.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.024
I will try to hold them at the water.

11:14.765 --> 11:16.265
No.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.468
Please, I cooperated.

11:18.502 --> 11:20.269
I gave you the names
of these men, remember?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.571
Like it was yesterday.

11:21.605 --> 11:23.873
Come on, Brewster. Up with you.

11:23.907 --> 11:26.209
Give him some help.

11:30.647 --> 11:32.982
We were sentenced to a prison ship.

11:33.016 --> 11:35.351
Under whose orders are we now to be hanged?

11:35.385 --> 11:36.452
Mine.

12:11.521 --> 12:13.389
<i>British soldier: Make ready!</i>

12:13.423 --> 12:15.491
<i>Present!</i>

12:15.625 --> 12:17.860

12:21.597 --> 12:23.532
<i>Simcoe: Into the church!</i>

12:32.942 --> 12:34.609
Fall back!

12:34.644 --> 12:36.778
Fall back!

12:46.388 --> 12:48.323
- Get back in there.
- Get your hands off me.

12:48.357 --> 12:50.191
<i>Don't give me any trouble.</i>

12:51.961 --> 12:53.861
The town's ours.

12:53.896 --> 12:57.265
- They've taken the captives to the church.
- Shite.

12:57.299 --> 13:00.602
- Search every door and get everyone inside the tavern.
- All right.

13:00.636 --> 13:02.637
And remind the men that no private
property is to be destroyed.

13:02.671 --> 13:04.272
<i>(gunshot)</i>

13:11.213 --> 13:13.648
<i>Man: That's Selah Strong.</i>

13:52.060 --> 13:53.896
Oi.

13:54.489 --> 13:56.056
You're gonna love this.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.192
You know them bloody-backs
used the church as stables?

13:58.226 --> 14:00.527
Well, they're using your old
schoolhouse as a magazine.

14:00.562 --> 14:02.229
Two dozen barrels of powder.

14:02.263 --> 14:04.698
He wasn't lying. They
ripped out the gravestones.

14:07.035 --> 14:09.436
<i>Caleb: Unholy bastards.</i>

14:09.470 --> 14:11.505
<i>Ah, here comes their leader.</i>

14:18.946 --> 14:22.115
Smuggle out the powder and any
other military stores you can find.

14:22.149 --> 14:24.718
All right.

14:27.521 --> 14:30.490
I don't recall giving
the orders to hang anyone.

14:30.524 --> 14:33.827
But, sir, don't you see? This very raid
confirms the treason of the accused.

14:33.861 --> 14:36.496
They obviously got word out to
these rebels to come and rescue them.

14:36.530 --> 14:39.733
No doubt the selfsame dragoons that
ambushed our regiment in Connecticut.

14:39.767 --> 14:42.735
I cannot abide executing
prisoners, Captain.

14:42.770 --> 14:46.239
Not when it reflects
dishonorably upon my command.

14:46.273 --> 14:50.343
This conflict will be
conducted in a civil manner!

14:53.147 --> 14:56.416
Complement one, are you ready to fire?

14:56.450 --> 14:58.918
Well, uh...

14:58.952 --> 15:00.887
we'll likely hit the gallows, sir.

15:00.921 --> 15:02.989
<i>If that's acceptable.</i>

15:05.626 --> 15:08.027
No, it is not.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.442
You secured the prisoners,
but not the powder!

15:23.476 --> 15:25.344
Complement two,

15:25.378 --> 15:28.948
adjust your quadrant,
target the storehouse.

15:28.982 --> 15:31.750
Now!

15:31.785 --> 15:35.287
Assistance is on its way and
I will not have the rebels

15:35.322 --> 15:36.889
absconding with our powder.

15:36.923 --> 15:39.358
Or using it against us.

15:39.392 --> 15:42.261
You may fire when ready.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.498
- Shh, shh. It's all right.
- (Thomas crying)

15:46.532 --> 15:49.301
<i>It's all right. Shh, shh.</i>

15:49.335 --> 15:52.838
It's all right. Come on. Shh, shh.

15:52.872 --> 15:56.208
- It's all right.
- Would you please shut that thing up?

15:58.344 --> 16:02.114
May I offer your men some ale?

16:03.249 --> 16:05.484
<i>May you offer?</i>

16:06.352 --> 16:08.086
(all gasp)

16:08.120 --> 16:10.188
This is my tavern, DeJong.

16:10.222 --> 16:13.158
I built it, I own it.

16:13.192 --> 16:16.561
And your wife sold it to me.

16:16.595 --> 16:20.365
I had no choice. They were
going to take it anyway.

16:20.399 --> 16:22.066
She had no right to sell it.

16:22.101 --> 16:24.169
The agreement is not binding.

16:24.203 --> 16:26.538
I did not write the attainder.

16:26.572 --> 16:28.473
Take it up with Judge Woodhull.

16:28.507 --> 16:31.009
Oh, I will, trust me.

16:31.043 --> 16:33.444
I have plenty to settle with the judge.

16:35.948 --> 16:38.449
<i>Last one out the door. Quickly.</i>

16:38.484 --> 16:40.718
Got it.

16:46.859 --> 16:49.060
Stand clear.

16:51.697 --> 16:55.466
Fall back! Fall back!

16:55.500 --> 16:58.135
(rumbling)

17:02.808 --> 17:05.108
Ah.

17:05.143 --> 17:06.710
Reload.

17:06.744 --> 17:08.546
- Reload!
- Yes, sir.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.647
And hold fire until ordered!

17:10.682 --> 17:14.050
- Sir? Sir?
- Yes?

17:14.085 --> 17:16.954
The magistrate is requesting
access into the camp.

17:19.491 --> 17:22.226
(groans)

17:23.662 --> 17:25.462
Richard, you shouldn't be here.

17:25.497 --> 17:28.531
Have you seen my son? Is he in the town?

17:28.566 --> 17:31.001
Let's get you inside.

17:33.371 --> 17:34.838
Hey.

17:34.873 --> 17:37.040
Will you burn your hometown now, Tallmadge?

17:37.075 --> 17:39.209
It's the king's men who are burning it,

17:39.244 --> 17:41.144
but take heart, we'll
have them out soon enough.

17:41.179 --> 17:42.979
Why don't you hold your tongue, Robeson?

17:43.014 --> 17:44.581
<i>Before you lose it?</i>

17:46.084 --> 17:47.918
Selah.

17:53.324 --> 17:55.091
Hewlett has us at range.

17:55.126 --> 17:56.660
We can't hope to hit him from here.

17:56.694 --> 17:58.628
I need you to put pressure on his flank.

17:58.663 --> 18:01.531
We can move up the ridge
to conceal our approach.

18:01.566 --> 18:03.767
That's even higher ground than his church.

18:03.801 --> 18:07.604
<i>Our church. Let's take it back, hmm?</i>

18:10.141 --> 18:11.941
Come with me.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.677
Say something.

18:18.082 --> 18:20.416
Benjamin.

18:24.088 --> 18:27.624
The major isn't firing
on us, he's firing on you.

18:27.658 --> 18:30.994
<i>Now, whatever you boys came here
to prove, I think you've proved it.</i>

18:31.028 --> 18:34.664
But I'm telling you right now,
you will never take that garrison.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.434
All you're gonna do is get all
these people killed, all right?

18:42.272 --> 18:45.908
Is that your wife, Woodhull? And your son?

18:45.943 --> 18:48.477
Yes, it is, yeah.

18:48.512 --> 18:50.313
Hmm.

18:50.347 --> 18:52.481
It's very fine to meet you, Mrs. Woodhull.

18:52.516 --> 18:56.118
I seem to remember your
husband as a much quieter man.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.751
Where the bloody hell is Floyd?

19:05.885 --> 19:07.352
Are you sure we need him?

19:07.387 --> 19:09.588
Seems to me you're doing an
excellent job of repelling the rebels.

19:09.622 --> 19:11.256
If you simply continue
the bombardment...

19:11.290 --> 19:13.425
My orders are to protect
this port, not level it.

19:13.459 --> 19:15.260
We must hold for reinforcements.

19:15.294 --> 19:16.828
We have the high ground, sir,

19:16.863 --> 19:19.698
and they failed to achieve their
objective with their opening thrust.

19:19.732 --> 19:22.467
To simply wait when it's
within our power to crush them...

19:22.501 --> 19:24.536
I will determine the
strategy here, Captain Sim...

19:24.570 --> 19:28.073
<i>(gunshots)</i>

19:28.107 --> 19:30.909
Selah: Rear right forward!

19:30.943 --> 19:33.712
<i>- (groaning)
- (Gunsts)</i>

19:33.746 --> 19:36.281
Take aim! Fire!

19:37.516 --> 19:39.050
(shattering)

19:39.084 --> 19:41.352
<i>(gunshots)</i>

19:41.387 --> 19:44.923
"They that sow wickedness, reap the same."

19:44.957 --> 19:46.424
Indeed, Reverend.

19:51.196 --> 19:53.231
Put your arms up towards the heavens.

19:53.265 --> 19:55.533
Shield the windows with the others!

19:56.635 --> 19:59.804
Captain, don't do this.

19:59.838 --> 20:02.440
Sit down before you fall down.

20:06.411 --> 20:08.613
Selah: Hold your fire.

20:08.647 --> 20:10.481
Who's the fastest man here?

20:10.515 --> 20:12.049
Ben: Damn it, what kind of a commander

20:12.084 --> 20:13.751
uses prisoners as a barricade?

20:13.785 --> 20:15.820
It's likely Captain Simcoe.
You may not know of him,

20:15.854 --> 20:17.588
but he's less subtle than the major.

20:17.622 --> 20:19.423
They mean to hold out
until reinforcements arrive.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.258
<i>Caleb: I figure we got
till sundown to break them.</i>

20:21.293 --> 20:22.826
<i>Ben: If that. You need
to take another detachment</i>

20:22.861 --> 20:24.495
<i>and round on them from the east.</i>

20:24.529 --> 20:26.330
<i>Then I'll send forth terms for surrender.</i>

20:26.364 --> 20:27.565
<i>If we take the church,
then we can use their cannons</i>

20:27.599 --> 20:29.233
to defend against the next wave.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.068
Hewlett will never surrender to you.

20:31.102 --> 20:33.971
And Simcoe will shoot down any Continental

20:34.005 --> 20:37.574
who approaches the church and then he
will kill your father and your uncle.

20:39.477 --> 20:41.245
Well, maybe we'll use his men to shield us.

20:41.279 --> 20:43.213
(cups clatter)

20:43.248 --> 20:44.848
<i>- (gasps)
- Anna: Leave him be!</i>

20:44.883 --> 20:46.450
<i>If you say you're better than them,</i>

20:46.484 --> 20:48.151
then show it by your restraint, Brewster.

20:48.186 --> 20:51.788
The major is a fair man. He
will respect a flag of truce.

20:51.823 --> 20:53.557
(Thomas crying)

20:53.591 --> 20:56.259
You said that Selah saw the
magistrate inside the church.

20:57.962 --> 20:59.896
That means your father's
there as well, Abe.

20:59.931 --> 21:01.798
Whatever happens to mine happens to yours,

21:01.833 --> 21:05.035
which makes you the perfect
man to deliver our terms.

21:10.408 --> 21:13.510
Let's take him somewhere private, huh?

21:13.544 --> 21:15.111
No!

21:15.146 --> 21:16.746
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- It's all right.

21:16.781 --> 21:18.715
We need your husband to send a message.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.016
We're not gonna hurt him.

21:20.051 --> 21:21.451
(gasps)

21:21.485 --> 21:24.287
Not much anyways.

21:24.321 --> 21:27.791
Mrs. Strong, would you
kindly open the cellar for us?

21:33.364 --> 21:35.531
Easy, easy, easy!

21:35.566 --> 21:37.166
Hey, hey! (laughs)

21:37.201 --> 21:39.402
Just keeping up the ruse, Woody, all right?

21:39.436 --> 21:41.804
- Ben, what the hell is this?
- Anna: Shh, you want them to hear us up there.

21:41.839 --> 21:43.473
Hey, I'm sorry.

21:43.507 --> 21:45.441
I couldn't send warning. There was no time.

21:45.476 --> 21:47.610
It was only by God's good grace
that we came across Walter Havens.

21:47.644 --> 21:48.978
He told us about the hangings.

21:49.012 --> 21:51.280
- There were no hangings.
- What?

21:51.315 --> 21:54.750
Not till you showed up. I had convinced
Hewlett to commute their sentences.

21:54.785 --> 21:56.218
They were bound instead for the Jersey.

21:56.253 --> 21:58.888
Oh, the Jersey.

21:58.922 --> 22:00.723
'Cause that ain't a death sentence, is it?

22:00.757 --> 22:04.427
Anna: Apparently it's not.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.464
I stood on the deck of that ship

22:08.498 --> 22:11.767
and had the warden tell me that
Selah died there over Christmas.

22:11.801 --> 22:15.004
I have lived with that belief

22:15.038 --> 22:17.473
since last we were in
New York spying for you.

22:17.507 --> 22:19.408
Surely you had time enough to warn me

22:19.442 --> 22:23.045
that my husband was alive and
serving alongside you both.

22:25.281 --> 22:27.382
Look...

22:27.417 --> 22:29.151
Anna, I'm sorry.

22:29.185 --> 22:31.053
It was my decision.

22:31.087 --> 22:35.324
Caleb wanted to tell, you but I said no.

22:35.358 --> 22:38.060
The truth is, your husband is alive

22:38.094 --> 22:40.395
because my brother is dead.

22:40.430 --> 22:43.565
Robert Rogers used the promise of Samuel

22:43.599 --> 22:45.901
as bait to trap me.

22:52.975 --> 22:55.110
Samuel is dead?

22:56.679 --> 22:59.647
Selah was with him when he passed.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.683
So I can confirm for you that, yes,

23:01.717 --> 23:03.985
the Jersey is a death sentence,

23:04.019 --> 23:07.789
and I will not see my father sent there.

23:07.823 --> 23:09.857
So...

23:09.892 --> 23:13.461
so this raid is family business?

23:13.495 --> 23:15.396
It's personal?

23:17.766 --> 23:19.434
You saying you wouldn't do the same?

23:19.468 --> 23:21.803
No, no, I'm just saying
it makes sense, is all.

23:21.837 --> 23:24.372
More sense than Washington
sending you both here anyway.

23:24.406 --> 23:27.642
He granted me discretion to
advance my mission as I see fit.

23:27.676 --> 23:29.944
Oh, I see. So you're gonna have
to explain it all to him, then.

23:29.978 --> 23:33.414
Good. When you do, please inform 711

23:33.448 --> 23:36.484
that his precious Mr.
Culpepper is finished.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.853
- I am out.
- Nobody is out.

23:38.887 --> 23:42.323
Your standing in this town is intact
and I intend to keep it that way.

23:42.357 --> 23:44.625
I'm not a soldier in your army, Major.

23:44.659 --> 23:47.528
I don't have to take your orders.

23:49.331 --> 23:51.231
But you're right about one thing.

23:51.266 --> 23:54.802
My standing in this town
is all you've got left.

23:54.836 --> 23:58.372
Now, I wasn't lying when I told
you Hewlett would never surrender.

23:58.406 --> 24:02.176
And you know there's no chance
that you take that church

24:02.210 --> 24:05.112
before some force on this island shows up.

24:07.282 --> 24:11.051
We ain't leavin' without
our family, all right?

24:12.787 --> 24:15.689
Well, then I guess today
you take your orders from me.

25:06.540 --> 25:09.709
<i>Abe: They are more
than 50, less than 100.</i>

25:09.743 --> 25:12.178
I tried to take a silent count,
but they caught me lookin'.

25:12.212 --> 25:13.713
I knew their numbers were exaggerated.

25:13.747 --> 25:15.881
They still outnumber us
and they have our flank.

25:15.916 --> 25:17.817
- So you mean to surrender?
- No.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.452
- They don't request...
- Good because I'd hate

25:19.486 --> 25:21.053
you to become the first commander

25:20.812 --> 25:22.812
to let the patriots get
a foothold on Long Island.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.290
<i>Abe: to They don't askts get
a for surrender, sir.</i>

25:24.324 --> 25:27.660
They... they know that
you will never bow.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.962
<i>(Richard coughing)</i>

25:32.532 --> 25:35.901
Abraham, what are their terms?

25:37.270 --> 25:39.471
Tallmadge says that he will trade

25:39.506 --> 25:41.306
the soldiers that he has in his custody

25:41.341 --> 25:43.208
<i>for the prisoners here in the church.</i>

25:43.243 --> 25:46.478
And that he will then
order a withdrawal, sir.

25:46.513 --> 25:49.915
Eight civilians in exchange
for conceding the field?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.683
When they have the numbers?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.019
I can't decide whether they think
themselves cowards or us fools.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.988
If further harm comes to any
of the prisoners here, sir,

25:56.022 --> 25:57.356
<i>he will retaliate in kind,</i>

25:57.390 --> 26:00.025
<i>and I am concerned for my family</i>

26:00.059 --> 26:01.727
and the other Loyalist captives down there.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.562
Your concern is none of our concern.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.864
Enough! You make it so I
cannot hear myself think.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.668
Major, you said yourself these
men are like a gangrenous limb,

26:09.702 --> 26:11.670
a sickness that needs to
be bled from this town.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.705
<i>- This is our chance.
- Lucas: A sickness?</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.473
What do you know of sickness, Woodhull?

26:15.508 --> 26:17.509
Quiet, Lucas, if you
know what's good for you.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.644
And this Major Tallmadge,
he has given his word

26:19.679 --> 26:21.346
that he will withdraw
following the exchange?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.348
The word of a traitor means nothing.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.517
These are hardened criminals.
If we just let them go,

26:25.551 --> 26:27.686
we're only adding to the
ranks of the Continental Army!

26:27.720 --> 26:29.687
Captain, you will keep your
opinion to when it is required.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.322
To yield is to show weakness.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.224
I will yield nothing that
I do not wish to yield!

26:33.259 --> 26:35.693
- I'm trying to save the town!
- Then kill the enemy!

26:35.728 --> 26:37.595
<i>Force them to charge the barricade!</i>

26:37.630 --> 26:39.964
Give them cannon and musket full-on!

26:42.534 --> 26:44.802
All they require is proper motivation!

26:44.837 --> 26:46.637
Captain, bring him back at once!

26:49.842 --> 26:51.776
(hammer clicks)

26:54.813 --> 26:56.781
(gunshot)

26:58.584 --> 27:01.185
(shouts)

27:07.825 --> 27:09.860
Fire!

27:12.964 --> 27:14.130
(shouting)

27:14.165 --> 27:16.499
No, Caleb, stop!

27:16.534 --> 27:18.401
<i>Caleb!</i>

27:18.436 --> 27:21.805
- Calm down. Caleb. Caleb, calm down.
- God!

27:21.839 --> 27:23.340
Eastin, your pistol, please.

27:23.374 --> 27:26.009
<i>Hewlett: Belay that.
Arrest Captain Simcoe.</i>

27:26.877 --> 27:28.711
Now!

27:32.550 --> 27:35.585
(grunting)

27:35.619 --> 27:39.822
<i>You deserve what's coming
to you, Oyster Major.</i>

27:39.857 --> 27:41.591
That's what they call you, you know.

27:41.625 --> 27:44.761
Commander of the
army's backwater-bred...

27:44.795 --> 27:47.663
(muffled)

27:54.705 --> 27:57.874
Prepare the cannon to repel a charge.

27:57.908 --> 27:59.876
We're in a fight to the death now.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.744
Not if you let them go.

28:03.914 --> 28:07.483
The prisoners, now. All of them.

28:07.517 --> 28:10.286
I'm quite sure an exchange
is off the table, Richard.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.189
No exchange...
a release,

28:13.223 --> 28:16.725
unconditional and immediate.

28:16.760 --> 28:21.063
And the good reverend will
convince his son to withdraw.

28:23.199 --> 28:26.969
I see no honor in this fight
going on. Only further bloodshed.

28:27.003 --> 28:29.605
(coughing)

28:32.042 --> 28:36.912
I'll have you know, it wasn't
me who took that shot at you.

28:43.786 --> 28:45.954
- Caleb: Come on!
- Ben: Just calm down. Calm down.

28:45.989 --> 28:47.923
(grunts)

28:47.957 --> 28:50.025
All right!

28:50.059 --> 28:52.661
- Stay down. Stay down.
- All right!

28:53.930 --> 28:55.931
<i>- Caleb, Caleb! Stop!
- Solider: Incoming!</i>

28:57.166 --> 28:59.868
<i>Don't fire. Shoulder your firelocks!</i>

29:05.074 --> 29:06.808
Get ready.

29:22.591 --> 29:24.659
Here.

29:26.128 --> 29:28.763
Take the bastard's shackles off him.

29:29.932 --> 29:33.201
Shoulder your firelocks.

29:33.235 --> 29:35.136
Rise.

29:35.170 --> 29:36.704
Fall back on me.

29:50.352 --> 29:53.521
Grab your haversacks
and head for the boats.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.030
Mr. Woodhull, please express
my thanks to the major

30:03.064 --> 30:04.732
for freeing the survivors

30:04.766 --> 30:06.233
<i>as well as my wish that he administers</i>

30:06.268 --> 30:08.736
the proper justice to Captain Simcoe.

30:08.770 --> 30:10.337
I will.

30:12.874 --> 30:14.508
Culper.

30:14.542 --> 30:16.977
What?

30:17.012 --> 30:19.380
Tell Washington it's Samuel Culper,

30:19.414 --> 30:21.415
not Culpepper.

30:21.449 --> 30:24.184
I won't sign the letters as anyone else.

30:30.091 --> 30:32.926
Abraham!

30:34.762 --> 30:36.763
It's all right. It's all right.

31:19.907 --> 31:22.375
(drumming)

31:31.752 --> 31:34.854
Lawful citizens of Setauket!

31:34.888 --> 31:39.058
We are here to protect your
persons and your property.

31:39.092 --> 31:41.861
<i>Retreat to your homes and stay there</i>

31:41.895 --> 31:44.096
until we've driven out the enemy.

31:44.131 --> 31:46.632
Just in time, eh, Major?

31:46.666 --> 31:49.602
Just.

31:59.012 --> 32:01.113
Let me look at you.

32:47.793 --> 32:51.129
<i>(horse whinnies)</i>

32:51.163 --> 32:53.665
(soldiers shouting)

33:01.206 --> 33:03.341
I'm sorry.

33:07.746 --> 33:10.214
<i>- The cause needs me here.
- Selah: Anna?</i>

33:11.350 --> 33:14.051
- No!
- Fire!

33:14.086 --> 33:16.154
Hold fire!

33:16.188 --> 33:18.222
<i>Don't hit her!</i>

33:21.560 --> 33:24.161
Don't just stand there.
She's trying to escape them.

33:24.196 --> 33:26.197
Go in and get her!

33:44.149 --> 33:45.716
It's all right. It's all right.

33:45.750 --> 33:49.086
- (panting)
- You all right?

34:07.063 --> 34:08.243
_

34:08.299 --> 34:09.967
Andre: The application of military force,

34:10.001 --> 34:11.635
like every other thing in creation,

34:11.668 --> 34:14.271
is subject to the natural
laws of cause and effect,

34:14.304 --> 34:17.440
especially when it is misused.

34:18.676 --> 34:20.877
You are familiar with the science

34:20.911 --> 34:23.647
of Sir Isaac Newton?

34:23.681 --> 34:25.782
I'm trying to quit.

34:25.817 --> 34:27.784
Sherry or physics?

34:29.687 --> 34:31.353
Best of luck with that.

34:31.389 --> 34:33.456
You may need a drink after we're done.

34:34.792 --> 34:38.194
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
come when I was summoned,

34:38.228 --> 34:41.264
but, you see, the cursed
rebels had other ideas.

34:41.297 --> 34:45.001
Benedict Arnold cut off half
our regiments from the fleet.

34:45.036 --> 34:46.536
<i>If it weren't for
the Queen's Rangers...</i>

34:46.570 --> 34:48.004
Saving our men from a harsh fate

34:48.038 --> 34:50.206
won't spare you from yours, Robert.

34:50.241 --> 34:52.742
Did you really think General
Howe would countenance

34:52.775 --> 34:55.612
your insubordination of last
month's prisoner exchange?

34:55.646 --> 34:57.814
<i>For every action,</i>

34:57.848 --> 35:01.250
<i>there is an equal and opposite reaction.</i>

35:01.285 --> 35:05.655
Or consequence, if you prefer.

35:05.689 --> 35:09.292
Inspector General Innes has
granted me full authority

35:09.326 --> 35:11.427
to overhaul our provincial forces

35:11.461 --> 35:13.563
before they become, and I quote,

35:13.597 --> 35:17.400
"a disorderly and destructive banditti."

35:19.570 --> 35:22.772
This ain't about no
prisoner exchange, is it?

35:22.806 --> 35:25.040
You lads have had it in for me

35:25.075 --> 35:28.544
ever since I refused to line your pockets

35:28.578 --> 35:32.214
in exchange for commissions
and weak officers.

35:32.249 --> 35:34.516
Instead, I hire
mean sorts...

35:34.551 --> 35:38.287
Indians, trackers,
Negroes, brawlers...

35:38.321 --> 35:41.490
and I refuse to let any man

35:41.524 --> 35:45.828
tell me how to go about my business.

35:47.197 --> 35:49.865
That shouldn't be a problem anymore.

35:49.899 --> 35:53.302
The Queen's Rangers will be
put under another's command.

35:55.905 --> 36:00.442
I am the Queen's Rangers,

36:00.476 --> 36:03.412
and those boys won't follow anyone else.

36:03.446 --> 36:05.414
Those boys are mercenaries.

36:05.448 --> 36:06.982
They follow coin.

36:10.887 --> 36:14.055
And I plan to pay.

36:14.090 --> 36:18.593
Oh, aye, you'll pay, all right.

36:18.628 --> 36:21.930
<i>(floorboard creaks)</i>

36:31.040 --> 36:33.374
Mm-hmm.

36:36.979 --> 36:39.214
I get your meaning

36:39.248 --> 36:42.684
about causes

36:42.718 --> 36:44.919
and their effects.

36:44.953 --> 36:48.423
Hmm?

36:50.626 --> 36:53.628
<i>(laughs)</i>

37:01.270 --> 37:04.772
A trick about these effects

37:04.806 --> 37:07.642
is they have ways

37:07.676 --> 37:10.544
of turning into new causes
if you're not careful.

37:10.579 --> 37:14.015
<i>What goes up must come down, huh?</i>

37:14.049 --> 37:18.519
(laughing)

37:29.397 --> 37:31.365
(laughing continues)

37:36.971 --> 37:39.206
<i>(door closes)</i>

37:42.777 --> 37:44.444
How's your father?

37:44.479 --> 37:47.281
He's safe at home.

37:47.315 --> 37:50.751
I just hope he didn't inflame
his wound with his efforts today.

37:55.323 --> 37:58.325
Are you all right?

37:58.359 --> 38:00.193
Tired.

38:00.228 --> 38:01.828
Yeah.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.531
Well, I can't imagine why.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.003
Where's Thomas?

38:18.813 --> 38:21.081
<i>(Thomas cooing)</i>

38:21.115 --> 38:23.183
(sighs)

38:38.132 --> 38:40.199
Mary.

38:49.510 --> 38:52.278
What have you done?

38:52.312 --> 38:55.615
<i>- What have you done?
- What have I done? What have I done?</i>

38:55.649 --> 38:58.517
Oh, are you going to shoot
me now, Abe? Is that it?

38:58.552 --> 39:00.152
- No. No.
- Am I your enemy, Abraham?

39:00.187 --> 39:02.555
- Have I always been your enemy?
- Mary, listen to me!

39:02.589 --> 39:04.423
Just... just let me
explain, all right?

39:04.458 --> 39:05.758
Let me explain about all of this.

39:05.792 --> 39:07.259
What is there to explain?

39:07.294 --> 39:10.863
You are a traitor and an adulterer

39:10.897 --> 39:13.332
and a spy for Washington.

39:13.366 --> 39:16.769
Oh, I'm sorry...
711, is it?

39:16.803 --> 39:18.370
If I had known that you were going to bring

39:18.405 --> 39:20.239
your Patriot friends
here to attack our town,

39:20.273 --> 39:21.907
I would've taken that book
straight to Major Hewlett,

39:21.942 --> 39:23.709
for now I am a party to treason.

39:23.743 --> 39:26.111
Damn it, Mary, I didn't know
that Tallmadge was coming here!

39:26.146 --> 39:28.480
He didn't warn me!

39:33.486 --> 39:35.787
It's just my luck, I suppose.

39:37.991 --> 39:40.626
Always walking in when I'm not wanted.

39:43.363 --> 39:46.865
Step away, Mary.

39:46.899 --> 39:48.200
(hammer clicks)

39:48.234 --> 39:50.469
(breathing heavily)

39:50.503 --> 39:52.971
Please...
please don't.

39:53.005 --> 39:54.773
You know I have to.

39:54.807 --> 39:57.475
No, you don't. You don't.

39:58.945 --> 40:01.513
<i>You can let me leave.</i>

40:03.516 --> 40:06.818
I will run away from
here and I won't return.

40:08.287 --> 40:11.723
You may be a treasonist, Mr. Woodhull,

40:11.757 --> 40:13.391
but I can't be.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.961
<i>- (grunts)
- (Mary screams)</i>

40:19.198 --> 40:20.798
Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker.

40:20.833 --> 40:23.201
(whimpering)

40:23.235 --> 40:25.803
<i>- (sobbing)
- (Thomas crying)</i>

40:25.838 --> 40:27.605
Mr. Baker.

40:31.010 --> 40:32.677
(hyperventilating)

40:40.486 --> 40:42.687
(sobbing) Mr. Baker.

40:42.721 --> 40:45.856
The rebels.

40:45.891 --> 40:48.359
The rebels fled the town,

40:48.393 --> 40:51.328
<i>and some of them went to the
boats but not all of them.</i>

40:51.363 --> 40:54.565
Some of them came through
the farms on their way out.

40:54.599 --> 40:58.369
<i>Four of them passed through our field.</i>

40:58.403 --> 41:00.504
Ensign Baker saw them,
he tried to stop them.

41:00.539 --> 41:03.040
<i>- They shot him.
- Mary!</i>

41:03.074 --> 41:05.175
They shot him!

41:05.210 --> 41:07.611
<i>And then they burnt down
the house of the judge's son.</i>

41:07.646 --> 41:11.782
But they took mercy on us
on account of our child,

41:11.816 --> 41:13.617
who still needs his mother and his father.

41:15.286 --> 41:16.587
As providence would have it,

41:16.621 --> 41:18.722
they were able to move into Whitehall

41:18.756 --> 41:20.557
just as they always should have.

41:22.327 --> 41:24.761
I know how to clean up a mess.

41:30.968 --> 41:33.370
(groans)

41:33.404 --> 41:35.472
Are you gonna go and get Thomas?

41:35.506 --> 41:37.674
You scared him with that shot of yours.

41:37.708 --> 41:40.143
Thomas.

41:40.178 --> 41:42.546
Mm.
