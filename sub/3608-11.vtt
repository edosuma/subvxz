00:02.001 --> 00:03.544
Previously on Lost:

00:03.629 --> 00:06.506
- We're taking the boy.
- I'm not giving you anybody.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.257
Dad.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.634
Walt.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.685
- Where is she?
- You mean Kate?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.561
I love her.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.536
Kate.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.795
Look here and here.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.716
You can see it's eroding
into the spinal artery in the L5 area.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.884
Plus all this extradural growth.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.471
I'm surprised it hasn't caused
permanent ischemia.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.103
He says
you don't need to talk in whispers.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.230
He knows
he doesn't have a chance.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.401
- Your father appreciates candor?
- We both do.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.572
Then tell him I'm very sorry,

01:12.656 --> 01:15.867
but he's not a candidate for surgery.

01:22.458 --> 01:26.836
The way the tumor is situated on the
spine, it's not possible to remove it.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.550
He wants to know why you won't try.

01:32.634 --> 01:36.804
Because what your father is looking for
is not a surgical procedure.

01:36.889 --> 01:40.224
What he is looking for is a miracle.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.613
He said, "I did not come
all this way for you, sir.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.823
I came for him."

02:01.038 --> 02:02.622
Ms. Busoni...

02:03.332 --> 02:06.292
You fixed a woman
with a crushed spinal column.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.294
An impossible surgery.
And now she walks, yes?

02:09.378 --> 02:12.799
I consulted many medical journals
before making this trip.

02:12.883 --> 02:17.303
Then you know it was a very different
case under different circumstances.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.889
But a miracle, right?

02:22.726 --> 02:26.521
Everything that my father's saying,
the risks, the unlikelihood,

02:26.605 --> 02:28.731
he's absolutely right.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.150
But will you try?

02:50.712 --> 02:54.006
I'll have to admit him
in the next couple of weeks,

02:54.091 --> 02:56.425
run some tests.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.055
Locke?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.813
John.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.026
Stay in there.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.653
- Michael.
- Stay in there, Jack.

03:59.281 --> 04:03.034
- Whatever's going on...
- I'm going after my son.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.494
And nobody is going to stop me.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.247
That is my right.
That is a father's right.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.334
There's another way...
You going to shoot me?

04:14.338 --> 04:18.007
No. But I'll shoot your damn computer.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.176
That thing is not what you think it is.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.554
You don't understand, man.
You don't have any idea.

04:23.639 --> 04:28.351
- Now get in there.
- We can do this together.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.897
- I'll come with you.
- No. I have to do it. Now.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.650
And I have to do it alone.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.006
- What happened?
- Michael knocked you out.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.926
- Look over here.
- Why would he...?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.637
He went after Walt.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.056
You feeling nauseated, sick?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.726
- No. I'm OK.
- Good.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.812
Give me a boost up.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.776
It's no use.
I bolted it shut from the inside.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.861
You what?

05:21.738 --> 05:26.033
No point changing the combination
if you can get in through the air vent.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.911
That's really good thinking.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.832
Wanna tell me
why you let Michael in here?

05:32.916 --> 05:38.254
He wanted a gun. For shooting practice.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.465
Shooting practice.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.429
The button.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.767
- How long was I out?
- About 20 minutes.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.857
We're on shift for the next four hours.
Nobody's coming down here.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.944
Better hope Sawyer shows up
to get his Band-Aid changed.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.794
Morning.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.339
- You just throw a banana at me?
- Couldn't find any rocks.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.011
There are nicer ways
to wake a man up, Freckles.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.805
It's time to get your bandages changed.

06:29.890 --> 06:34.185
- Why can't you do it for me?
- Because I'm not your nurse.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.687
And Jack's got the bandages.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.773
Of course he does.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.362
Wanna give me a hand?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.333
Thanks.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.294
Come on.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.675
- This place still creeps me out.
- You'll get used to it.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.929
Where is everybody?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.557
Jack? John?

07:13.642 --> 07:16.185
- Maybe they went out for ice cream.
- In here.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.814
Jack?

07:19.898 --> 07:23.234
In here. In the armory.
Michael locked us in here.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.653
- What'd he say?
- I got it.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.158
Hope you got the combo, Doc.

07:31.243 --> 07:34.120
Right three times to 25.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.207
- Twenty-five, got it.
- Left two times to 29.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.380
Right once to 40.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.303
- Howdy, boys.
- What are you doing?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.889
We're going after him.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.562
What happened?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.981
Michael went after Walt.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.567
Went after Walt?

08:04.651 --> 08:08.320
Held a gun on me, put us both in there,
and went after Walt.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.079
- What're you doing?
- What does it look like?

08:17.164 --> 08:20.332
- I'm coming with you.
- You're still on antibiotics.

08:20.417 --> 08:24.003
It's a good thing
I'm traveling with my doctor, then.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.599
How is he?

08:36.683 --> 08:40.686
- I thought you'd gone home.
- My home is a hotel room.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.107
I like it more here.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.611
I think you need to find a better hotel.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.280
You didn't answer my question.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.869
His counts aren't
where I'd like them to be.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.708
You've been doing tests for a month now.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.251
I'm thorough.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.390
I have a confession to make.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.937
I don't believe in miracles.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.150
Guess I'm not too sure
about them, either.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.029
I bet your wife feels differently.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.533
Your wife, she is the woman
you fixed, isn't she?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.828
Yes.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.582
I'm thorough, too.

09:45.460 --> 09:51.006
She must be very special to let you work
until 4:30 in the morning.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.843
Completely lost track...

09:54.928 --> 09:58.555
- I gotta... Will you excuse me?
- Of course. Go.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.311
And, Jack, thank you.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.650
Of course.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.360
Good night.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.372
Hey.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.459
How is he?

10:27.544 --> 10:30.671
Hey. Sorry to wake you.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.426
I gotta get up anyway.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.845
So, how is he?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.598
About the same.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.984
Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to...

10:52.068 --> 10:54.069
It just got...

10:56.406 --> 10:59.074
That's the price
of being a miracle worker.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.832
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to the gym.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.418
Then I got some papers to grade.

11:28.271 --> 11:33.108
I didn't wanna say anything
until I knew either way, but...

11:35.445 --> 11:38.906
I was late, so I got a pregnancy test.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.168
Don't worry. It was negative.

11:55.465 --> 11:59.093
Do you wanna talk about it?

12:01.096 --> 12:03.680
What's to talk about?

12:04.307 --> 12:05.516
Sarah, I...

12:06.309 --> 12:08.310
See you later, Jack.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.072
Well?

12:20.156 --> 12:24.576
I can't say it's definitely Michael's,
but it looks like his boot print.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.662
There's one over here, too.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.248
That sounds like a trail.

12:29.332 --> 12:32.376
- You got a gun for me?
- You're not coming.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.585
Excuse me?

12:33.670 --> 12:36.088
Someone has to take care of the button.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.340
So why should that person be me?

12:38.425 --> 12:41.093
You're not coming. You're staying.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.847
All right?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.603
Let's go.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.374
- What'd she do to you?
- What?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.669
Kate. What'd she do?

13:15.753 --> 13:19.173
- She didn't do anything.
- Right.

13:19.257 --> 13:23.427
Yelling at her because she wanted
to help get Mike makes a lot of sense.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.597
Why don't you go back
and see if I hurt her feelings?

13:26.681 --> 13:30.058
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, I know.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.103
- You love her.
- What'd you say?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.817
What?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.654
Any of this look familiar
from when you were coming back?

13:42.739 --> 13:46.575
Yeah. There's my favorite leaf.
How could I forget this place?

13:47.577 --> 13:48.744
What's wrong?

13:48.828 --> 13:53.832
When you came across the island,
what side was the ocean on?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.841
You came from the east.
Michael's heading north.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.302
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

14:05.386 --> 14:09.473
He's not going back
to where you came from.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.142
He's heading somewhere else.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.387
- Hello, Hurley.
- Hey.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.472
Cool hat, dude.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.978
- Is Kate all right?
- Yeah.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.357
I guess Michael took off.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.152
What do you mean?

15:04.237 --> 15:07.072
He stole some guns
and he went all commando.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.615
Said he was going after Walt.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.161
Later, dudes. Gotta get to the hatch.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.104
Doc, you wanna slow down?

16:24.275 --> 16:26.485
Take a break a minute?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.570
Good idea.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.909
He still heading north?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.078
Yep.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.539
- You think he's lost?
- Doesn't seem to be.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.000
Trail's as straight as the interstate.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.378
The path of a man
who knows where he's going.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.548
Where are you going, Jack?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.927
What?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.971
Let's say we catch up with him.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.767
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna bring him back.

16:58.851 --> 17:03.689
- What if he doesn't wanna come back?
- I'll talk him into coming back.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.441
This is the second time
he's gone after Walt.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.028
He knocked me out.
He locked us both up.

17:10.113 --> 17:14.366
Something tells me
he might be past listening to reason.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.452
You think we should just let him go?
Write him off?

17:17.537 --> 17:23.250
Who are we to tell anyone
what they can or can't do?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.182
It's not too late to go back.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.892
The tumor's aggressive,

17:40.977 --> 17:44.187
but your father could lead
a normal life for another year.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.398
Go back where?

17:47.024 --> 17:49.359
Home?

17:50.153 --> 17:54.656
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.169
Is that it?

18:13.259 --> 18:18.680
Even if you don't succeed,
you're giving us a chance.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.226
That's all we wanted.

18:26.022 --> 18:29.733
I'll come out and check on you
before I scrub in.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.651
OK.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.950
Am I interrupting?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.495
No, I was just leaving.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.586
I'll see you in the morning.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.013
ITR reports need to be signed
by you as chief resident.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.480
What?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.941
Careful.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.153
There's a line, Son.
You know it's there.

19:15.238 --> 19:18.990
Pretending it's not would be a mistake.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.704
Guess you would know.

19:29.252 --> 19:34.256
It may be OK for some people,
but not for you.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.077
You sure Mike went this way?

20:04.954 --> 20:08.456
- Why do you ask?
- I don't know, Mr. Clean.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.918
I probably would have gone
around Mount Vesuvius.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.047
Why'd you pick that name?

20:18.092 --> 20:21.052
Ain't it obvious?

20:21.137 --> 20:25.015
All you need's an earring and a mop.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.602
No. Your name. Why'd you pick Sawyer?

20:28.686 --> 20:29.686
Pick?

20:29.770 --> 20:35.734
After the census,
Hurley gave me the flight manifest.

20:35.818 --> 20:39.237
Your name is James, right? James Ford.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.449
What's it to you?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.827
Just an interesting name to choose.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.913
Who'd you get it from?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.707
Who says I got it from anybody?

20:57.214 --> 21:00.258
- Michael.
- Jack, get down.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.843
- Michael!
- Jack!

21:16.859 --> 21:17.984
Michael!

21:23.407 --> 21:25.033
- Michael?
- Jack!

21:27.578 --> 21:28.954
What?

21:31.707 --> 21:34.084
- He's close.
- He was shooting at someone.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.295
- You want them coming back?
- Personally, hell, yeah.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.631
You said these people
were two days away.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.217
They took Cindy
less than a mile from our camp.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.302
Over here.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.644
- Shell casings. How many?
- Three. Michael's.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.064
You boys deaf?
I heard at least seven shots.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.025
You heard them, Daniel Boone.
What's your count?

21:59.110 --> 22:01.820
Seven sounds about right.

22:01.904 --> 22:05.448
It's getting dark.
Which way did Mike go?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.503
What?

22:18.587 --> 22:21.715
You out here for Michael,

22:21.799 --> 22:25.176
or just payback for getting shot?

22:25.261 --> 22:27.387
Why are you out here, Doc?

22:29.765 --> 22:33.268
You got your reasons, and I got mine.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.906
Jack.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.491
Jack!

22:48.576 --> 22:50.702
- I had it.
- I know, Son.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.203
I got it all. I had it.

22:52.288 --> 22:56.624
He was a sick old man on a table
for seven and a half hours.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.879
His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.552
I've got to go tell her.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.096
I've already done that.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.020
Lest you forget,
I am still chief of surgery.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.525
Where is she?

23:23.444 --> 23:27.489
- Maybe you should go home.
- Where is she?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.533
She's gone.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.164
Jack.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.334
Go home.

24:03.818 --> 24:04.984
Jack.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.657
Gabriela.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.622
My father told me that you'd gone. I...

24:21.836 --> 24:22.794
I...

24:22.878 --> 24:26.381
Thank you for trying.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.432
I'm so sorry.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.192
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

24:58.914 --> 25:00.915
- Wait...
- It's OK.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.553
I can't.

25:24.398 --> 25:26.441
What do you mean, you lost it?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.694
He's a man, not a boar.
His sign's more subtle.

25:29.778 --> 25:34.073
- I need light to follow him.
- Here. Light.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.704
- We'd better head back.
- What?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.706
- Find the trail.
- I've lost it.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.210
You don't just lose a trail.
You just don't want to find him.

25:45.961 --> 25:50.131
I've been running through the jungle
toward the sound of gunfire

25:50.216 --> 25:52.217
because I don't care about Michael.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.222
- Don't turn around on me.
- You won't get him to come back.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.851
If we just turn around and go back,
we're never gonna see him again.

26:01.936 --> 26:06.856
And that's gonna be on us.
On you and on me.

26:06.941 --> 26:09.734
You're exactly right.

26:12.488 --> 26:17.909
But if I were you,
I'd listen to Mr. Locke.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.257
Who are you?

26:32.341 --> 26:35.426
He's the son of a bitch
that shot me on the raft.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.513
Why don't you point the gun down?

26:48.857 --> 26:53.945
Probably be best if we just keep
our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.198
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry about Michael.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.158
He's not gonna find us.

27:00.828 --> 27:05.456
- What do you want?
- Why don't you build us a fire?

27:07.376 --> 27:11.087
I think it's time we all had a talk.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.766
Geronimo Jackson?

27:29.064 --> 27:32.817
As an expert in all things musical,
I never heard of these guys.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.320
Shocking as that may be.
Geronimo Jackson?

27:35.404 --> 27:38.197
This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.

27:44.246 --> 27:48.291
So what do you think is the story
with that Libby chick?

27:48.375 --> 27:51.544
- The story?
- She's kind of cute, right?

27:52.838 --> 27:57.008
In a "I've been terrorized by the Others
for 40 days" kind of way.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.054
There is that.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.685
I think I have a chance with her.

28:07.770 --> 28:10.188
It's the classic desert-island scenario.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.482
If I ever had a shot, this is it.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.906
You think Claire's missed me yet?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.657
Dude, it's been a day.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.880
- This music is quite depressing.
- We can change it, dude.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.257
You ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.718
I'm afraid not. Where is Jack and Locke?

28:40.803 --> 28:42.762
They went after Michael.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.140
- Michael?
- He's run after Walt again.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.310
- Everyone's gone to bring him back.
- Who's everyone?

28:49.395 --> 28:53.940
Everyone. Jack, Sawyer, Locke.
And Kate.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.781
Just sit down, Jack.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.409
I come in peace.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.536
How do you know our names?

29:06.620 --> 29:08.579
You took Walt.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.918
Walt's fine. He's a very special boy.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.588
You said you wanted to talk. Talk.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.551
How long you been here on the island?

29:23.345 --> 29:24.429
Fifty days.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.850
Fifty days?
That's almost two whole months.

29:30.269 --> 29:35.523
Tell me, you go over a man's house
for the first time,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.109
do you take off your shoes,

29:38.193 --> 29:41.654
put your feet up on his coffee table,

29:41.738 --> 29:45.408
walk in the kitchen,
eat food that doesn't belong to you,

29:45.492 --> 29:49.245
open the door to rooms
you got no business opening?

29:52.040 --> 29:55.460
Somebody a whole lot smarter
than anybody here once said,

29:55.544 --> 29:58.296
"Since the dawn of our species,

29:58.380 --> 30:02.842
man has been blessed with curiosity."

30:02.926 --> 30:06.012
You know the other one
about curiosity, don't you?

30:09.016 --> 30:12.059
This is not your island.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.437
This is our island.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.064
The only reason you're living on it

30:17.149 --> 30:19.609
is because we let you live on it.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.908
I don't believe you.

30:28.243 --> 30:33.539
- You don't believe what?
- I think you got one guy with a gun.

30:33.624 --> 30:36.876
I think there's more of us
than there are of you.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.378
I think if you had any real strength,

30:39.463 --> 30:41.422
you wouldn't have had to send a spy.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.594
Ethan.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.642
That's an interesting theory.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.102
Light them up.

30:59.233 --> 31:03.694
We got a misunderstanding.
Your people, my people.

31:03.779 --> 31:08.658
So listen carefully.
Right here, there's a line.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.702
You cross that line,

31:11.787 --> 31:15.790
we go from misunderstanding
to something else.

31:17.501 --> 31:21.212
Give me your weapons,
turn around, and go home.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.881
No.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.009
- Jack, maybe...
- No!

31:30.472 --> 31:33.224
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.143
Bring her out, Alex.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.359
She was following you.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.153
Like I said, curiosity.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.660
Don't.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.709
The decision
you gotta make right now is this.

31:59.793 --> 32:05.089
Can you live with the fact that I shot
this woman right in front of you,

32:05.173 --> 32:08.634
and you could've saved her life
by giving up and going home?

32:10.971 --> 32:14.974
Or are you gonna give me your guns,
turn around, and walk away?

32:15.809 --> 32:18.853
It's your call.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.731
- If you touched a hair on her head...
- Shut up.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.903
I'm going to count to three.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.490
One.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.287
Two.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.290
Stop.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.604
Now them.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.820
Give me the other one, too.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.426
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.584
Jack...

34:08.004 --> 34:10.589
You all right?

34:12.967 --> 34:15.511
Yeah.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.313
I was just trying to help, Jack.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.358
When you told me not to go, I just...

35:53.318 --> 35:55.569
I made a mistake.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.076
Could you just talk to me for a second?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.165
I'm sorry.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.630
I'm sorry, too.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.943
- Hey.
- Hey. How did it go?

36:38.238 --> 36:39.905
He died.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.494
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.790
- Who was over?
- My mom.

36:51.668 --> 36:55.296
- The bridge game OK?
- Oh, yeah. She's on a streak.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.384
- Did you eat?
- Yeah. No.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.471
It's late. I'm fine.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.899
- You don't have to do that.
- It's therapeutic.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.318
Cheaper than a shrink.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.497
How did the daughter take it?

37:31.625 --> 37:34.001
What's her name, Gabriela?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.753
She kissed me.

37:43.261 --> 37:48.015
She kissed me and I kissed her back.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.356
I don't know how it happened.

37:57.567 --> 38:01.820
I made a mistake, and this is my fault.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.656
It's my fault that you and me...

38:04.991 --> 38:06.992
I haven't been here, Sarah.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.873
We don't even talk anymore.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.378
I hate what's happening to us.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.464
I promise you that things
are gonna be different.

38:20.548 --> 38:25.219
I'm gonna work less.
I'm gonna be here for you.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.765
I'm gonna fix this. We're gonna go
back to the way things were.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.526
Jack?

38:48.618 --> 38:50.995
I'm leaving you.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.958
What?

38:56.042 --> 39:00.170
I was already leaving you.
My mother was helping me pack.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.815
I've been seeing someone.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.905
Someone else.

39:31.161 --> 39:35.539
I have to... I can't stay.

39:44.632 --> 39:49.094
You will always need something to fix.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.018
Goodbye.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.542
See you, James.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.007
Don't beat yourself up, Freckles.

40:27.092 --> 40:30.052
If he'd told me to stay,
I'd have done the same thing.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.812
What's the matter
with the little squirt?

40:42.065 --> 40:44.733
Who's that?

40:44.818 --> 40:47.152
You don't like old Uncle Johnny?

40:49.489 --> 40:52.491
What is he doing to your toe?

40:57.872 --> 41:02.751
Go away. I barely have
enough food to feed myself.

41:02.836 --> 41:04.837
Here.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.091
I see you found a new friend.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.553
Progress.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.562
I hear you were out looking for Michael.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.022
Yeah.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.778
He ran off looking for his kid again?

41:38.872 --> 41:41.874
Not much you can do about that, then.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.671
Is it true that you killed one of them?

41:49.215 --> 41:51.967
One of who?

41:52.051 --> 41:53.802
Them.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.810
Sayid tells me that you're a cop.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.858
I was a cop.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.527
Can I ask you something?

42:10.612 --> 42:11.904
Shoot.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.075
How long would it take to train an army?
