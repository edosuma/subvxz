00:09.310 --> 00:12.180
*

00:15.549 --> 00:17.718
Stomp your feet!

00:17.751 --> 00:20.054
Clap your hands!

00:20.088 --> 00:23.457
Riotous cacophony
to accompany...

00:23.491 --> 00:25.293
Talma...

00:25.326 --> 00:26.560
(applause)

00:26.594 --> 00:28.329
...into our next phenomenon.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.199
Prepare to
be amazed

00:31.232 --> 00:34.635
and mystified
by the ultimate

00:34.668 --> 00:37.605
feat of transfiguration!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.246
(applause and cheering)

00:45.279 --> 00:49.717
Now, I ask
for only one thing.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.152
Your silence.

00:51.185 --> 00:55.723
Pay very close attention to...

00:58.892 --> 01:00.494
(applause and cheering)

01:00.528 --> 01:02.496
That's good.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.766
SUSANNA:
Watch closely and learn

01:05.799 --> 01:07.435
why we call this

01:07.468 --> 01:08.569
Aquarius.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.808
(applause and cheering)

01:14.842 --> 01:16.844
(whooping)
(laughing)

01:16.877 --> 01:19.747
SUSANNA:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19.780 --> 01:21.749
I now give you,

01:21.782 --> 01:24.485
like the mermaids
of legend, Talma!

01:30.658 --> 01:31.892
(scattered applause)

01:31.925 --> 01:33.761
Is she supposed
to be in there?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.629
Uh, yeah, looks like it.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.165
SUSANNA:
Again, I give you

01:37.198 --> 01:38.799
Talma!

01:38.832 --> 01:40.334
(drumroll)

01:43.237 --> 01:44.272
Man, poor girl.
I'm sorry.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.707
I heard they're supposed
to be pretty good, but...

01:46.740 --> 01:48.376
- Not so much.
- SUSANNA: Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:48.409 --> 01:49.710
I, uh...

01:49.743 --> 01:51.179
Close it.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.648
Close it now!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.817
I don't think
this is part of the show.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.886
- No.
- SUSANNA: Someone call 911!

02:00.888 --> 02:02.556
Excuse me for
a minute, okay?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.492
Yeah.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.829
Oh, come on, Charlie,
I can't believe this.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.431
Celtic green in my house!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.866
Those were the stakes, my
friend. I'm sorry.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.867
- The Lakers lost the Finals.
- No, no.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.736
You will wear it.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.271
You're just not
into b-ball, huh?

02:18.906 --> 02:20.808
Uh, you see how it brings out
the worst

02:20.841 --> 02:23.911
in otherwise reasonable people?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.913
Larry, when you were
in that monastery,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.349
you think you figured
anything out?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.583
I remind you,

02:29.617 --> 02:31.419
I was thrown out
of that monastery.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.521
But what do you mean,
figured things out?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.756
Like, in terms of what?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.691
I went to this temple
the other night.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.227
Really?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.328
Yeah.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.363
And, uh, I hadn't been in one

02:42.396 --> 02:43.931
since my mother's funeral.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.234
Before that,
I-I was probably 13.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.835
That is quite
a span.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.803
So, what brought you back?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.439
Well...

02:51.472 --> 02:53.207
(phone ringing)

02:53.241 --> 02:55.409
So it goes.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.844
Yeah, David.
What's up?

02:56.877 --> 02:59.380
I thought you were on a date.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.415
Yeah, I'm on my way.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.684
Got to go
to the Tower of Mystery.

03:03.717 --> 03:07.388
The Tower of Mystery.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.390
Tower of Mystery?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.892
One of those LA landmarks
I've always wanted to see.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.694
I got a magician
who disappeared.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.463
ALAN:
Magician who disappeared?

03:15.496 --> 03:18.899
Isn't that
what's supposed to happen?

03:18.932 --> 03:21.435
DAVID: Two magicians were on the
stage.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.371
One does patter,
other one does a trick.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.405
Talma, no last name--

03:24.438 --> 03:26.274
she was in that
thing right there,

03:26.307 --> 03:27.508
flowers swirling
around her, then poof,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.377
she's gone, and it's
filled with water.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.611
That's a good trick,
I guess.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.712
That's what I thought,

03:31.745 --> 03:33.714
but according to her
partner, The Amazing Susanna,

03:33.747 --> 03:35.449
aka Susie Weisz,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.418
Talma's not supposed
to disappear.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.820
She's supposed to stay
in that thing, Aquarius,

03:39.853 --> 03:40.921
swimming around
in the water.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.624
SUSANNA: She's never supposed to
leave the cylinder.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.427
She stays in there
for the entire trick, but...

03:46.460 --> 03:48.896
she just disappeared.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.899
A woman transposed
from air to water,

03:51.932 --> 03:54.335
back to the beginning
of life.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.304
Can we please
go home now?

03:56.337 --> 03:58.639
Talma is hiding
under the stage.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.474
No, she's not hiding
under the stage.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.376
You really want to follow
through with this hoax?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.544
'Cause, I tell you,
I've learned

04:03.577 --> 04:05.313
from personal experience--
you don't mess with the FBI.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.548
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.684
The cylinder looks complete,
but the stage

04:10.718 --> 04:13.521
is actually seven inches deeper
than the proscenium indicates.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.390
Well, yeah, but that has
nothing to do with the trick.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.891
Seven inches is plenty deep
for Talma

04:17.925 --> 04:19.460
to disappear
under the stage.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.429
No, you don't
understand.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.030
We have rehearsed this
hundreds of times,

04:23.063 --> 04:24.432
and she has always

04:24.465 --> 04:25.098
been in there.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.367
Open the trap door, please.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.336
What trap door?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.670
DON:
Hey, if there's a door there,

04:29.703 --> 04:30.738
buddy, you better open it.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.542
Hey, she may pay you.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.610
Does she pay you enough
to go to jail

04:36.644 --> 04:38.879
for filing a false FBI report?
Open the door!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.280
Okay.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.584
Ladies and Gentlemen,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.353
may I present to you

04:45.386 --> 04:46.587
the vanished Talma?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.455
(gasps)

04:51.959 --> 04:53.394
DAVID:
Tell me that blood

04:53.427 --> 04:54.628
is part of the trick.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.615
Our techs put it between one

05:14.648 --> 05:16.750
and two liters
of blood in that box,

05:16.784 --> 05:18.686
so something bad
happened down there.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.788
I mean, we're sure
she was in here?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.557
No one saw her, but our lab
results will tell us something.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.825
All right, let's have it.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.993
Where is she?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.828
I don't know.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.063
You already lied to the FBI,
okay? You told us

05:30.097 --> 05:31.899
that Talma wasn't supposed
to leave Aquarius.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.467
DON: Then we got the trap door.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.334
You want to go
for strike three now?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.538
I think I should talk
to my lawyer.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.606
DAVID:
Oh, yeah.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.575
Forgot about my date, Sarah.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.377
I'll be right
back, all right?

05:43.411 --> 05:45.012
The blood could
be a prop,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.114
could be part of
the act, you know?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.549
Spray some blood on the walls,

05:48.582 --> 05:49.783
vanish, voila,
you got a great trick.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.918
DON: So a hoax?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.052
It's easy enough to figure out.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.054
We'll use an application
of blood spatter trigonometry

05:54.087 --> 05:56.390
to study
the correlation

05:56.424 --> 05:57.290
between this blood and then

05:57.324 --> 05:59.092
Talma's probable position
in the box.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.529
Sounds like a place to start.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.730
Now, I would assume,
these pipes

06:02.763 --> 06:04.532
are for the pumping
of the water.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.634
Yeah, and I'm thinking
these angled air movers

06:06.667 --> 06:08.135
in the corners
get the air swirling.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.137
Oh, dear.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.940
I'm gonna get
some latex gloves.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
Professor Charles Eppes?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.811
I'm, uh, Penn Jillette.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.012
Penn and Teller?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.147
I'm a big fan.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.482
- You are?
- Yeah.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.950
I've read everything
you've written.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.552
I even read your book.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.587
Not as good as the original
paper, but, uh...

06:26.620 --> 06:27.655
- Oh.
- I was upstairs

06:27.688 --> 06:30.123
prepping a special
and heard you were down here.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.693
Man, it is so great
to meet you in person.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.496
Well, you know, uh, actually,
I'm a big fan of yours, as well.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.464
Really? Cool.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.965
Yeah, you work with
the other guy, right?

06:37.998 --> 06:38.699
Yeah, yeah.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.200
Okay.
I like the white tigers.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.769
(laughs)

06:41.802 --> 06:44.905
I could never get Feynman
to go to Vegas, either.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.874
You knew Feynman?

06:46.907 --> 06:49.209
Really easy guy to fool,
and loved every minute of it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.445
All right. It was a great
pleasure meeting you.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.013
I've got to get back to work. Of
course.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.849
Uh, I'd love to talk
to you about your paper

06:55.883 --> 06:57.017
about Infinite Series
Cognitive Dissonance

06:57.050 --> 06:58.686
Leading to Semantic
Contamination.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.821
That's not my paper.
(laughs)

07:00.854 --> 07:02.656
White tigers.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.757
- All right.
- I heard about Talma.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.925
If you need any help,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.060
well, I know a little bit
about magic.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.996
Thank you,
Mr. Jillette.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.134
Sarah?! Excuse me.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.503
Sorry about that.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.638
Got to... It's okay. I get it.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.206
Job comes first.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.941
I'll make it up to
you, okay? Maybe...

07:20.974 --> 07:21.809
You seem like a good guy.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.945
Maybe under different
circumstances.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.984
Let me call
you a cab.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.520
Too late.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.864
WOMAN:
Excuse me, Agent?

07:43.897 --> 07:46.934
Is the FBI involved in the
case of a missing woman?

07:46.967 --> 07:50.037
Is it true that a large amount
of blood was found at the scene?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.104
I'm sorry. No comment.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.106
We're in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.208
All right? So, you guys
excuse me. Thank you.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.443
Excuse... Move.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.079
What we do know right now is
that the magician is missing...

07:59.112 --> 08:01.515
NIKKI:
And Talma No-Last-Name

08:01.549 --> 08:03.684
started disappearing
before last night.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.853
DMV comes up empty,
no medical records.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.722
So, I guess we can forget
about a blood match, huh?

08:08.756 --> 08:09.923
What else did you get?

08:09.957 --> 08:13.193
Our lady Copperfields have
a history of fake emergencies.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.529
2007, Boulder, Colorado.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.598
They do this buried alive
illusion.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.100
As they piled the dirt on,
Talma's casket collapses.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.103
It takes emergency crews
45 minutes

08:23.136 --> 08:24.805
to dig up an empty coffin.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.973
Three months later,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.174
Fairbanks, Alaska-- same deal

08:27.207 --> 08:29.276
with an escape
from a fire that failed.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.377
And let me guess.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.647
Both times Talma miraculously
reappeared unharmed?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.115
Uh-huh.

08:35.148 --> 08:39.019
They paid 50 grand in fines,
sold 250 grand in tickets.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.891
That box looks secure
from the inside.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.958
That's what I'm
thinking, too.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.227
There's no way she got out
of that without help.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.296
And her partner was on stage
the whole time.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.664
Oh, of course.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.865
That's what magicians do.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.667
You know, make it look like

08:53.701 --> 08:55.135
they're here
when they're not, right?

08:55.168 --> 08:58.171
I saw a special where one guy
made a limo disappear.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.942
Turns out, it was 14 guys,
a mirror

09:01.975 --> 09:04.878
and three pieces of plywood
painted asphalt black.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.280
Yeah.
Well, I'm working on a list

09:07.314 --> 09:09.049
of people they've
both worked with.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.884
Figure, maybe one
of them will pop.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.321
Yeah, for a crime we're not even
sure happened, my head hurts.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.691
WOMAN (on TV): Is it true that a
large amount of blood

09:17.725 --> 09:18.325
was found at the scene?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.392
Uh, no comment. Uh, sorry.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.128
We're in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.130
Ah, Agent Harry Potter,
first on the scene.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.066
WOMAN (on TV): Well, what we do
know right now is that...

09:26.099 --> 09:27.901
If I had taken her
anywhere else, man,

09:27.935 --> 09:29.903
a movie, anything,
there'd be another date.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.071
Stop bitching.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.940
Give her a call.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.908
Right, you're a big TV star now.
She's gonna love that.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.877
So, of course, now I got
the assistant director on my ass

09:36.910 --> 09:37.945
about why one
of our agents has dragged us

09:37.978 --> 09:40.080
into a case that's gonna
make us look like idiots.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.248
Don, I'm sorry. She...

09:41.281 --> 09:43.250
We got to find
the girl now, all right?

09:43.283 --> 09:46.086
WOMAN (on TV):
Reporting for News Eight.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.121
CHARLIE: You ever get the
feeling you're searching

09:48.155 --> 09:48.622
for an answer

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
you already have?

09:49.790 --> 09:52.626
Well, so much for an unbiased
search for the truth.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.628
Is Charlie still determined
to predetermine the results?

09:54.662 --> 09:55.796
That's not fair.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.064
AMITA:
I think you're cherry-picking

09:57.097 --> 09:59.066
the data to give you
the answer you expect.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.734
You pick the next batch.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.869
Who doesn't like magic?

10:01.902 --> 10:04.337
Top hats and tails and pulling
bunnies out of thin air.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.773
It's...

10:05.806 --> 10:07.875
Elvis on black velvet.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.777
Well, I love the feeling
of a live audience,

10:09.810 --> 10:10.778
swept up in the suspense

10:10.811 --> 10:13.080
of the show, trying to
figure out the trick,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.048
looking for the mirrors.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.784
Yes, and just a little relieved

10:16.817 --> 10:18.051
when you don't
see them.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.753
I'll show you the mirrors.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.121
Oh, no, you don't, Dr. Eppes.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.623
I won't let you ruin this
for me, too.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.129
So, the serology report
on the blood found at the scene

10:29.162 --> 10:31.431
verifies that it is human,
O positive.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.266
There's Barr bodies
in the cell structure

10:33.300 --> 10:34.668
and the Kell antigen,
which indicates

10:34.702 --> 10:35.869
- that it's a white female.
- And the DNA

10:35.903 --> 10:38.739
in the hair sample that we
picked up in her dressing room

10:38.772 --> 10:41.408
does match the DNA in the blood,
so very good chance it was Talma

10:41.441 --> 10:42.275
in that box.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.343
All right, so let's say it's not
a hoax.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.378
Let's say it's real--
who'd want to hurt Talma?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.247
- The partner?
- Susie Weisz,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.850
a known box jumper,
the beautiful assistant,

10:49.883 --> 10:51.151
but not a real magician

10:51.184 --> 10:53.020
until she she started
working with Talma.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.088
Talma's good-looking,
from all accounts,

10:55.122 --> 10:57.457
the more talented
magician.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.926
Why would she switch places,

10:58.959 --> 11:00.393
basically taking
the assistant's job

11:00.427 --> 11:01.995
and put herself in the cylinder?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.230
DAVID:
Who knows?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.297
The fact still remains that
Talma was the big draw, right,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.700
so I doubt the Amazing Susanna
would do anything

11:06.734 --> 11:08.135
to try to harm
her meal ticket.

11:08.168 --> 11:08.969
COLBY: I've been running down

11:09.002 --> 11:11.038
some more of the
names of the people

11:11.071 --> 11:11.905
that perform with them--
nobody's talking.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.874
I mean, it seems
like the world of magic

11:13.907 --> 11:15.375
is all about
keeping a secret.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.078
I still say this
is just one more stunt.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.747
You know, fake a felony,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.348
get on the news,
get famous.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.016
So, what's the blood
supposed to mean?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.085
Well, there's what
it usually means.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.020
CHARLIE: So, blood spatter
trigonometry

11:27.054 --> 11:28.922
suggests the spatter
is real.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.958
Uh, it came
from a body

11:30.991 --> 11:33.193
being torn
by a sharp force trauma.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.394
So, you know what happened
inside the box?

11:34.427 --> 11:35.395
We weren't trying

11:35.428 --> 11:36.864
to reconstruct the actual event.

11:36.897 --> 11:37.898
We were looking

11:37.931 --> 11:40.067
to validate
or rather invalidate

11:40.100 --> 11:41.068
the blood spatter.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.335
It's like when you walk outside

11:42.369 --> 11:44.171
and you notice
that the ground is wet.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.138
The question is: Did it rain

11:45.172 --> 11:47.307
or is the water
coming from somewhere else?

11:47.340 --> 11:51.111
A droplet of water falling
in a vertical line from a cloud

11:51.144 --> 11:53.346
will slam to the ground
and splash outward.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.015
Water from a garden hose

11:55.048 --> 11:57.117
will have an entirely different
mathematical signature.

11:57.150 --> 12:01.021
Different vectors, velocity,
a far more obtuse angle.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.991
So, we compare the rain triangle
to the garden hose triangle

12:04.024 --> 12:05.759
to tell us if it rained

12:05.793 --> 12:09.162
or if your neighbor
just recently washed his car.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.464
Now, we were able to analyze the
pattern of the blood droplets,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.200
as well as the angle
and velocity

12:13.233 --> 12:14.434
of the impact to determine

12:14.467 --> 12:16.103
with fairly high
probability

12:16.136 --> 12:17.470
that Talma did suffer
a real injury.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.539
Now, whether it was an accident

12:19.572 --> 12:22.009
or the result of some sort
of struggle, I'm not sure.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.376
I would love
to consult

12:23.410 --> 12:27.314
with an expert
who might be able to tell me

12:27.347 --> 12:28.315
which it was.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.117
Yeah, sure, go for it.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.486
DON: Hey, what happened with
your, uh, date?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.156
(sighs)

12:36.189 --> 12:37.825
Did you call her?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.993
- Yeah, she's not answering.
- Go bring her some flowers

12:40.027 --> 12:41.829
or something-- we'll be
all right for an hour.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.973
(sighs)

13:00.113 --> 13:01.281
Hi, uh, I'm David.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.116
I'm... I'm looking for Sarah.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.284
Sarah?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.021
This is, uh, 1F, right?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.589
I... I picked her up here
last night.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.191
We just got back today.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.895
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.129
Is it... is it possible

13:16.163 --> 13:17.597
maybe, uh, Sarah
is staying here?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.932
Long hair,

13:18.966 --> 13:20.100
African-American?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.202
We have lived here
for 33 years.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.371
I don't even know a Sarah.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.456
DON:
Whose idea was it to go

13:43.490 --> 13:44.858
to this magic show?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.093
Hers.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.628
And you met her
at the Howling Dog, right?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.097
That's a known cop bar.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.965
A set-up from the start.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.033
A couple
of magicians

13:53.066 --> 13:55.168
want to amp up the disappearance
of their main act,

13:55.202 --> 13:56.904
what better way
than to get FBI

13:56.937 --> 13:58.171
in on a missing persons
investigation?

13:58.205 --> 14:01.074
Yeah, I hope she was hot.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.542
Hey, don't feel so bad, big guy.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.610
You know, I'm thinking

14:03.643 --> 14:05.412
a night out, no matter what,
sounds pretty good.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.479
DON:
And I don't care

14:06.513 --> 14:08.415
what that blood says,
I say we're being played.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.318
Yeah, time to talk
to the Amazing Susanna again.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.054
CHARLIE:
You've made a career

14:14.087 --> 14:15.222
of demystification.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.057
But we weren't
the first.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.027
Houdini dedicated
his life to revealing

14:20.060 --> 14:22.162
these charlatans
that defraud the human race

14:22.195 --> 14:24.364
with their lies, the
talking to the dead,

14:24.397 --> 14:25.198
the psychics.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.967
LARRY: Yes, well, the blood
spatter

14:27.000 --> 14:28.101
was not faked.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.602
CHARLIE: The FBI suspects that
there

14:29.636 --> 14:33.440
was a third party involved
in Talma's disappearance.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.176
An illusion this complicated,
she would have needed the help

14:36.209 --> 14:37.277
- of an artisan.
- An artisan?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.445
Yeah, the people

14:38.478 --> 14:41.114
who actually build
and design the tricks.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.082
Angel has, like,

14:42.115 --> 14:44.351
30 of these guys
working for him.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
You know, we'd both love
to see these blueprints.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.554
Good luck.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.190
A trick like Aquarius
is worth millions

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
to the guy who
creates it.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.526
Once these women
do it, it becomes

14:53.560 --> 14:55.228
public domain--
within a year, you got

14:55.262 --> 14:57.564
20 acts doing
their versions.

14:57.597 --> 15:01.168
The Swimming Pool,
the Water Cube,

15:01.201 --> 15:02.535
the Shark Tank.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.403
Let me show you
this thing.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.039
This was a feature trick
30 years ago.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.241
Done on TV and everything.

15:08.275 --> 15:13.480
Now you can buy it
at any toy store.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.682
That's the way things
work in this business.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.350
Neat trick, huh?

15:17.384 --> 15:18.585
Hydrophobic sand.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.353
You do know your magic.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.990
I know my science.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.225
It's gonna be hard
to find this engineer.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.627
No one will reveal
who the artisans are,

15:27.660 --> 15:29.696
especially not the artisans.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.699
Henning had to
deposit money

15:32.732 --> 15:35.635
in an untraceable bank account
to look at some blueprints.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.670
Maybe we don't need to know.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.472
Maybe we can reverse
engineer the trick

15:39.506 --> 15:41.308
on our own and find out
who built it.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.043
Study the architecture
to find the architect.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.345
You do know your science.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.713
Well, no.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.648
I know my magic.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.051
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.653
I mean, yes, we made you
part of the show.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.723
I mean, an FBI agent
involved...

15:56.756 --> 15:59.426
it adds to the hype,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.062
but that blood was not
part of the illusion.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.099
So... what
is the trick?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.368
I mean, uh...

16:08.401 --> 16:10.170
how does Aquarius work?

16:10.203 --> 16:11.704
Well, I... I don't know.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.041
I mean, that's Talma's thing.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.044
I do patter, exhibition.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.478
Misdirection.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.512
Well...

16:19.546 --> 16:20.647
yeah.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.115
I'm gonna...

16:22.149 --> 16:26.319
need the name--
the real name-- of my date.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.422
Well, I... I have no idea.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.124
Talma set it up.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
She just told me
to expect a cop

16:33.526 --> 16:36.496
and to keep him occupied
and away from the box.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.200
When that math guy opened it,
I expected her to be in there.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.169
That was how we
rehearsed it every time.

16:42.202 --> 16:46.173
So, she doesn't tell you
how the trick works.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.207
All right, she
lies to you

16:47.240 --> 16:48.708
about the endgame,

16:48.741 --> 16:51.778
then she puts you in the middle
of an FBI investigation?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.016
She used me.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.521
She didn't get out of
that box by herself,

17:01.554 --> 17:03.523
so who besides yourself
would help her?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.392
Garland Saint Michael.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.127
Formerly the
Miraculous Michael.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.195
You know your magic.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.028
He's on our list

17:09.062 --> 17:13.733
of Talma's...
past collaborators.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.770
He and Talma were hot and heavy
before he got all mystic-purist.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.208
Uh, he's the guy
who hung himself

17:21.241 --> 17:23.310
from flesh hooks for 24 hours

17:23.343 --> 17:24.411
on live TV.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.578
And that's magic?

17:25.612 --> 17:28.081
He thinks so.

17:29.516 --> 17:34.087
I'll spend six days
in my Dream Cocoon.

17:34.121 --> 17:38.391
Total sensory
deprivation.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.093
Do you wish to lay in it?

17:40.127 --> 17:42.262
No, thanks.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.232
On the seventh day, I'll emerge,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.167
an altered state
of consciousness,

17:47.200 --> 17:50.103
unable to take
even the slightest sound

17:50.137 --> 17:51.438
or color for granted.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.140
Yeah, I bet
you'll be hungry, too.

17:53.173 --> 17:58.145
Talma and I remain close,
and I wish her all success.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.746
We differ in tone,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.514
but unite in passion.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.649
You do realize she's missing.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.385
Is she?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.819
Where were you
last night?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.155
Las Vegas.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.389
Drove in this morning.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.823
I'm sure Caesar's
has security footage

18:10.857 --> 18:12.559
of me preparing
for my next piece.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.161
Do you know
where she is,

18:14.194 --> 18:15.528
what she's
planning?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.398
We haven't even spoken
for months.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.233
But I'm not surprised
she went

18:20.267 --> 18:22.369
with the classic--
the Vanishing Lady.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.172
That's really the core
of our differences.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.907
Magic isn't magic

18:27.940 --> 18:30.510
until it elevates
the human spirit.

18:30.543 --> 18:34.447
Talma is stagnating,
attempting to make art

18:34.481 --> 18:36.216
- from rubbish.
- Is that why

18:36.249 --> 18:38.685
she let Susie Weisz
play the part of the magician?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.154
Talma needs to be in the middle
of the action.

18:41.188 --> 18:44.257
Touching the trick,
really feeling it.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.426
Oh, on that much we agree.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.928
We found a liter
of blood at the scene.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.898
She's a genius.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.334
No matter
how mundane,

18:54.367 --> 18:57.637
Talma would literally bleed
for a trick.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.940
I have faith
that when she

19:00.973 --> 19:03.210
reveals herself
to the world,

19:03.243 --> 19:06.713
it's going to be beautiful.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.719
Let's consider
the Gliederpuppe.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.322
David said the
cylinder was empty.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.357
Then, the lights went out
for a few seconds.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.825
Then, the cylinder was filled.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.194
Well, let's
be conservative here.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.196
How about five seconds?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.497
AMITA: That's a long time for
the audience

19:24.531 --> 19:25.698
to be sitting
in the dark.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.866
Let's say 3.5.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.401
CHARLIE:
Coming up through the floor,

19:28.435 --> 19:30.703
fighting gravity,
the water pressure required

19:30.737 --> 19:32.339
to fill that cylinder

19:32.372 --> 19:33.406
in such a
short time...

19:33.440 --> 19:36.743
The pressure on the human
body would be enormous.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.877
That makes Talma one tough lady.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.279
It's an amazing feat, really.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.913
I mean, it's almost like

19:40.947 --> 19:43.250
her response to
the misogyny

19:43.283 --> 19:44.651
of cutting a
woman in half.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.554
She's created this...
this mechanical paean

19:47.587 --> 19:49.722
to the beauty
of womankind.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.325
She reverse evolves
the female,

19:52.359 --> 19:53.760
surrounded by flowers,

19:53.793 --> 19:55.628
then she drops her right back

19:55.662 --> 19:58.431
into the elegance of the ocean
where all life began.

19:58.465 --> 20:01.568
It's almost like Venus
returning to her clamshell.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.970
You really see all that?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.238
You really don't?

20:05.272 --> 20:07.374
All I see is pipes
and air movers

20:07.407 --> 20:11.010
and flowers and fish
being pumped in and sucked out.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.546
Why can't you accept magic
as an art?

20:13.580 --> 20:14.981
Why allow yourself

20:15.014 --> 20:16.616
to be pummeled by water pressure
every night.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.751
Isn't there an
Occam's razor here?

20:18.785 --> 20:20.387
I mean, you said yourself,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.289
the solutions
to magic tricks

20:22.322 --> 20:23.856
are often underwhelming
and simple.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.027
Why do the "reverse evolution?"

20:28.060 --> 20:30.597
Why water coming in
every night?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.300
Uh-huh. You see these

20:33.333 --> 20:34.701
- and these?
- Well,

20:34.734 --> 20:35.868
isn't that just
where the glass connects

20:35.902 --> 20:37.470
to the decoration
on the outside?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.771
CHARLIE: I think Larry's half
right.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.673
This isn't a reverse

20:40.707 --> 20:42.575
evolution trick.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.878
This is a woman coming
out of the water.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.647
LARRY:
And into the air.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.781
She flies?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.550
She flies.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.552
The micro thin flying wires
for the harness

20:52.585 --> 20:54.654
enter through the cylinder
here and here.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.988
It's unseen by the audience.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.524
She looks like she's flying

20:57.557 --> 20:58.925
in a fully-encased
cylinder.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.293
David didn't say

21:00.327 --> 21:01.361
- anything about flying.
- And we didn't

21:01.394 --> 21:03.863
find a rig in the rafters
at the Tower of Mystery

21:03.896 --> 21:05.732
because that wasn't
part of the trick

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
that night.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.801
There's a second part
to the trick?

21:08.835 --> 21:09.969
LARRY:
Ah, but of course.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.704
The stunning conclusion.

21:11.738 --> 21:12.739
The vanished

21:12.772 --> 21:14.374
woman reappears,

21:14.407 --> 21:15.708
in the glory
of flight.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.509
We need to flip

21:16.543 --> 21:17.977
the trick, make it
work backwards.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.912
Yeah, reverse the reverse
engineering.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.814
Worst ways to spend a night.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.750
I'll go put
a kettle on.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.422
Hey.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.657
Hey.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.325
Late supper?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.426
On a little break.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.894
Lost in contemplation?

21:34.927 --> 21:36.696
Yeah.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.098
You know,
when last we spoke,

21:39.131 --> 21:41.568
you were asking me
about religion.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.636
- Right.
- Well,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.472
at the very basic level,

21:45.505 --> 21:47.774
cosmological quantum
physics suggests

21:47.807 --> 21:49.776
that if this universe here

21:49.809 --> 21:52.345
is as real as we believe
that it is,

21:52.379 --> 21:55.515
it must have been cast
into reality

21:55.548 --> 21:57.517
by an external observer.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.018
God?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.388
And yet paradoxically,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.022
how can there be anything
external

22:03.055 --> 22:04.757
in an all-inclusive universe?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.759
- Uh-huh.
- So, you see?

22:06.793 --> 22:09.696
My own quest for God has
always been inextricably

22:09.729 --> 22:12.532
intertwined with my work.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.767
Does that help you sleep?

22:14.801 --> 22:15.702
No.

22:15.735 --> 22:16.869
It keeps me awake.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.871
(chuckles)

22:18.905 --> 22:20.840
All right, so,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.108
what's the point?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.476
The point

22:23.510 --> 22:26.779
is to keep looking
for the point.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.081
That's what the
Rabbi said.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.950
- Rabbi?
- Yeah.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.652
Rabbi.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.921
Well...

22:34.954 --> 22:36.923
I will rejoin Charlie and Amita.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.691
Oh, and I should
do that, too.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.666
Tough to track a woman
without an identity,

22:46.699 --> 22:48.601
but I found Talma's
corporation.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.738
Two weeks ago, Aquarius
Specialties Limited

22:51.771 --> 22:53.906
rented trucks to load in
at the Tower of Mystery.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.642
Now, where'd the trucks
pick up from?

22:55.675 --> 22:57.644
Movers said that they
picked up two big crates

22:57.677 --> 22:59.145
in the middle
of an abandoned parking lot.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.013
- Paranoid magicians.
- Yeah,

23:01.047 --> 23:03.716
hoax the FBI--
I'd hide my prep, too.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.052
Aquarius Specialties Limited
also rented a storefront

23:06.085 --> 23:07.620
on Hollywood Boulevard.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.855
It's a high
traffic area,

23:08.888 --> 23:11.190
lots of tourists,
entertainment seekers.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.725
Charlie thinks
there's gonna

23:12.759 --> 23:13.726
be a part two to Talma's trick.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.861
Which is why

23:14.894 --> 23:17.196
I checked into the party rental
agencies in the area.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.799
Two of them have
been contracted

23:19.832 --> 23:21.033
to deliver folding
chairs, tents

23:21.067 --> 23:23.870
and big screen TV's
to the same location.

23:23.903 --> 23:24.971
Come on.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.553
"Hollywood
Brasserie"?

23:40.587 --> 23:42.489
Talma loves her misdirection.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.862
Oh, come on, now, does it really
need to be this dark?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.864
You scared, Granger?

23:51.898 --> 23:53.866
Nah.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.736
I was top of my class
in "Pitchblack Assaults

23:56.769 --> 23:59.672
on Magical Illusions"
back in Quantico.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.487
Let's see.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.222
Lights.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.877
Talma's not coming
back from this one.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.623
Murder?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.792
Well, ME's initial
report is inconclusive.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.794
Talma drowned,
but she has a contusion

24:54.827 --> 24:55.795
on the side of her head, too.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.997
She also had a laceration
on her right leg,

24:58.030 --> 24:59.065
pretty deep.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.299
That explains the
blood we found

25:00.332 --> 25:01.901
at the Tower
of Mystery.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.970
However she got cut,
accidental or otherwise,

25:04.003 --> 25:05.071
the wound was
bandaged,

25:05.104 --> 25:06.573
trace amounts of blood
in the water.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.640
She didn't bleed to death.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.909
According to Charlie's analysis,

25:09.942 --> 25:11.043
this was the master
fail-safe--

25:11.077 --> 25:12.579
it's a handle that
would release

25:12.612 --> 25:13.680
the water.

25:13.713 --> 25:14.947
Now it was broken off
and wiped clean

25:14.981 --> 25:17.684
of prints, so, definitely
somebody was here.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.018
Hairline fracture
in the glass

25:19.051 --> 25:20.853
could match the contusion
on her head.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.154
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe
there was a struggle,

25:22.188 --> 25:23.623
and she got
knocked out

25:23.656 --> 25:24.557
- against the glass.
- Yeah,

25:24.591 --> 25:26.025
then the killer dumped her,
unconscious,

25:26.058 --> 25:27.560
in the water
to drown.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.028
All right, so they broke
the handle--

25:29.061 --> 25:30.062
that's master
fail-safe,

25:30.096 --> 25:30.963
so the internal ones

25:30.997 --> 25:32.298
- wouldn't work.
- It still

25:32.331 --> 25:34.033
doesn't answer one big question.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.902
Who'd want to kill her?

25:37.269 --> 25:39.639
Why can't they just build
a normal machine,

25:39.672 --> 25:41.674
with everything laid out
in an orderly fashion?

25:41.708 --> 25:42.975
Function fit to form.

25:43.009 --> 25:46.112
The magic design
for the magic machine.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.947
Let's take a break
from the flying part.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.616
You know, it's like
a jigsaw puzzle.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.817
You put together
the frame pieces

25:50.850 --> 25:53.119
before trying to work the more
difficult middle section.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.121
You know she's right.
If we could just get a handle

25:55.154 --> 25:56.355
on the cylinder,
we could figure out

25:56.388 --> 25:59.025
how much tensile strength is
needed for these flying wires

25:59.058 --> 26:00.326
and how much
for the common joints

26:00.359 --> 26:01.794
between the glass and filigree.

26:01.828 --> 26:02.862
Uh, the glass.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.930
That's simple.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.097
The first question.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.633
How much water
can it handle?

26:06.666 --> 26:08.067
Well, witnesses
from the performance

26:08.100 --> 26:09.869
report that it was full.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.705
Talkin' 50 cubic
feet of water.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.073
400 gallons.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.808
Water weight 3,300 pounds.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.977
A little over one a half tons.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.211
- Wow.
- That amount

26:19.245 --> 26:20.880
of water...

26:20.913 --> 26:22.649
withstanding
that kind of pressure.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.851
You're not gonna find that kind
of glass at Home Depot.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.153
There are two factories

26:27.186 --> 26:28.988
that produce
the quality of glass

26:29.021 --> 26:31.057
that Charlie says is required
to create the cylinder.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.660
Asahi Glass in Tokyo

26:33.693 --> 26:35.261
and Undverglasen in
Garmisch, Germany.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.729
Undverglasen shipped

26:36.763 --> 26:39.632
four tons of multi-ply
tempered-curved glass

26:39.666 --> 26:40.466
to a Burbank warehouse
last year.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.702
Well, before she hit
the fast track

26:42.735 --> 26:43.770
with Susie Weisz,
she bounced around

26:43.803 --> 26:44.837
for about five years.

26:44.871 --> 26:45.905
Why's that?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.006
Maybe because her previous

26:47.039 --> 26:48.741
boss drowned while
was on stage.

26:48.775 --> 26:49.976
Who's the girl
in the middle?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.278
That's Drowndini's
assistant.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.946
NIKKI:
That could be a lead.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.014
Sister blames Talma

26:55.047 --> 26:56.048
for her brother's death.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.650
COLBY:
Yeah, same MO, drowning,

26:57.684 --> 26:59.786
could fit for revenge.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.721
That's my date.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.991
Sarah.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.760
Her real name

27:07.794 --> 27:09.128
is Jenny Calandro.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.734
Can't believe
your search led you

27:14.767 --> 27:16.903
to the doorstep
of Gage Jones.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.071
Impressive,
Dr. Eppes.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.741
Uh, guy is one
of the legendary artisans

27:21.774 --> 27:24.076
of the magic world.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.779
Of course, last I knew,
he was, uh,

27:26.813 --> 27:28.447
working
in an abandoned ferry

27:28.480 --> 27:30.449
on Fidalgo Island
in Washington.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.384
Is all right that we just let
ourselves in like this?

27:32.418 --> 27:33.920
Oh, I called ahead.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.255
Uh, magic awaits.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.424
Professor Fleinhardt,
if you would, please.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.426
- My pleasure.
- Around here.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.361
The guillotine!

27:45.765 --> 27:46.966
It's a far

27:46.999 --> 27:49.936
better thing I do,
than I have ever done.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.971
The blade

27:52.004 --> 27:52.872
folds up into the trick.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.975
- Shh!
- It's angles. It's all angles.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.476
That's all I'm saying.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.945
Okay, let's, uh,
show you another one.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.113
How about the Kafka box?

28:01.147 --> 28:03.449
Are you ready
to metamorphosize?

28:03.482 --> 28:05.384
Into what, a cockroach?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.489
CHARLIE: So this one is a false

28:10.522 --> 28:11.724
back.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.691
He's still inside the box.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.464
Okay, that's pretty cool.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.967
He climbs in,
Penn spins the box,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.468
engages the catch,

28:22.501 --> 28:24.103
the catch releases
two mirrors.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.905
The mirrors fold out
at 45 degree angles.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.473
You think you're looking
at the back of the box,

28:27.506 --> 28:28.507
it's really just
reflections.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.509
Hey, quiet you.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.745
Mr. Jillette.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.213
Three guests.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.750
From the FBI.

28:37.784 --> 28:40.086
You're here

28:40.119 --> 28:42.354
because of the lovely and
talented Miss Talma, I take it.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.792
Well, may be a wasted trip,
she's not here.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.760
But she'll turn
up in due time

28:47.794 --> 28:49.361
at a place of her choosing,
for the best

28:49.395 --> 28:50.763
- possible impact.
- I hate

28:50.797 --> 28:52.231
to break it to you,
she already turned up.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.766
Oh, was it wondrous?

28:53.800 --> 28:54.834
She was dead.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.235
- Real dead.
- But I...

28:56.268 --> 28:58.304
just saw her.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.773
I mean I built Aquarius.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.275
She was found in the second part
of the trick

29:03.309 --> 29:04.343
on Hollywood Boulevard.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.345
She drowned inside.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.347
No, couldn't have drowned.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.482
We had too many fail-safes
built in.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.485
There was a handle
on the outside

29:13.519 --> 29:15.487
that was broken off
by someone else.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.556
You know a, a girl,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.125
a former assistant--
Jenny Calandro?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.560
Yeah, I know Jenny.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.529
Talma brought her around
a couple times

29:23.562 --> 29:25.497
- to look at Aquarius.
- NIKKI: You got an address?

29:25.531 --> 29:27.834
We think it may not
have been an accident.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.368
You're damn right
it wasn't an accident.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.103
If Talma's dead,

29:31.137 --> 29:32.771
she was murdered.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.245
Hello.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.814
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.015
What's on?

29:43.049 --> 29:45.051
Baseball, basketball,
football, hockey.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.118
Take your pick.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.520
What, you got to ask?

29:48.554 --> 29:50.456
- Hockey.
- That's right.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.561
(sighs) So...

29:55.594 --> 29:57.196
So what is, uh,
what is all this

29:57.229 --> 29:59.065
about you, uh,
going to temple?

30:00.199 --> 30:02.334
I went once.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.904
Yeah, and?

30:04.937 --> 30:08.174
Thinking I might take
a class or two.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.878
You know, I'd be more than happy
to talk to you about it.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.112
I mean, I've been
to Hebrew school.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.180
I know all the prayers.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.915
Thanks.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.149
(stammering):
We'll see how it goes.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.250
I think I'm okay for now.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.552
Right.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.622
Hockey.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.957
(sportscaster talking
indistinctly on TV)

30:27.927 --> 30:30.897
I know I'm still new
and all,

30:30.930 --> 30:33.165
but is this status quo
for you guys?

30:33.199 --> 30:34.166
What's that?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.435
Stalking girls on company time.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.540
My date's home.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.110
Jenny.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.414
You've got to be kidding me.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.250
You do have a way
with the ladies.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.584
(siren blaring)

30:58.490 --> 31:00.192
Oh!

31:05.064 --> 31:06.198
(horn honking)

31:06.232 --> 31:07.934
(tires screeching)

31:11.637 --> 31:13.472
Come on, girl, you are not
playing chicken with the FBI.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.242
(engine revving)

31:32.424 --> 31:33.625
(handcuffs tightening)

31:33.659 --> 31:35.127
Yeah, she is pretty.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.507
I didn't kill Talma.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.942
I swear.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.543
DAVID: You blamed her for your
brother's death.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.479
You wanted revenge.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.347
Anthony was reckless.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.483
He didn't check his gear,

31:57.516 --> 31:58.684
his machines.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.686
He thought that
if they worked once,

32:00.719 --> 32:02.554
they always worked.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.424
That's what killed him,
and I knew that.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.726
Oh, so it was a coincidence
that you were at the show

32:07.759 --> 32:09.261
the night that Talma
disappeared?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.530
I mean, the night
she was murdered.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.466
Talma dealt with my brother's
death differently.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.369
I moved on.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.338
She made it her life's work
to court death.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.575
I brought you to the show,

32:23.609 --> 32:25.177
because an old friend
asked me to.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.378
I was her assistant,

32:26.412 --> 32:28.314
nothing more.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.749
You helped her out of that box?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.452
As soon as you left,
I went under the stage,

32:33.485 --> 32:35.554
removed the hatch.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.323
Talma was covered
in her own blood.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.624
When she fell through
the trap door,

32:38.657 --> 32:40.059
she hit a metal strut,

32:40.092 --> 32:41.193
tore her leg open.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.062
No, we never found
a bloody strut.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.297
She took it,
said it added to the mystery.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.299
Look, I wanted
to take her

32:47.333 --> 32:49.701
to the hospital,
but she insisted she was fine.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.470
We bandaged the leg,

32:51.503 --> 32:54.140
I helped her to her car
and she drove off on her own.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.641
Where'd she go?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.209
To Hollywood.

32:57.243 --> 33:01.180
To make sure the second Aquarius
was working properly.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.116
I told you, she learned from
what happened to my brother.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.287
My job was to
get back to you.

33:11.090 --> 33:14.593
You were just supposed
to be some... cop.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.527
(chuckles)

33:17.463 --> 33:20.232
I could have gone up
to any guy in that bar.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.767
But I was selfish.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.604
I went up to the right one.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.707
Best sucker in the house.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.244
Not what I meant.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.788
She lying?

33:42.821 --> 33:45.457
I doubt it.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.826
But, hey, I'm the last guy
you should ask, right?

33:47.859 --> 33:48.527
What are you
talking about?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.329
You're the only one I can ask.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.399
Don, send somebody else
in there... to talk to her.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.270
Well, either she's very good,

33:58.304 --> 34:00.306
or she does like you.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.040
(sighs)
Hmm.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.377
I believe she knew Talma.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.480
I believe she was working
with Talma that night.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.685
And I believe
there's much better ways

34:13.719 --> 34:16.455
to get payback
than to sucker an FBI agent

34:16.488 --> 34:19.258
into watching you
kill your target.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.360
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- So what do we do with her?

34:21.393 --> 34:24.096
She committed a crime,
and she ran.

34:25.831 --> 34:26.832
You make the call.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.574
AMITA:
How much have they dismantled?

34:35.607 --> 34:38.310
Well, apparently, the
veneer was taken down,

34:38.344 --> 34:39.845
but the guts remain.

34:39.878 --> 34:43.582
The guts, which are usually
under the stage

34:43.615 --> 34:46.218
and lead
to a panel offstage

34:46.252 --> 34:48.154
where the technician
calls the shots.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.788
These must be
the fail-safe dials.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.523
Check the glass.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.192
All right,
looks like there are

34:53.225 --> 34:55.794
two switches hidden
inside the cylinder:

34:55.827 --> 34:59.131
one high and one low.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.532
Water release valves.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.633
And techs indicate
they have not been touched.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.902
Makes a good argument
for Talma being unconscious.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.472
She couldn't trip
the fail-safes.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.606
One, two, three input pipes.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.907
Reconstruction
of the apparatus

35:08.940 --> 35:10.909
indicates there should
be at least four.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.644
Six if they were
playing it safe.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.146
So to fill this cylinder

35:14.180 --> 35:15.714
with three pipes
in five seconds...

35:15.747 --> 35:17.583
- Or less.
- would require

35:17.616 --> 35:19.451
higher water pressure
than we'd anticipated,

35:19.485 --> 35:20.586
extremely high water pressure.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.388
Where does
that leave us?

35:25.391 --> 35:26.892
All right, hey.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.160
We don't think Talma
was murdered.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.163
No, our findings suggest that
higher than intended pressure

35:31.197 --> 35:33.432
was ultimately responsible
for Talma's death.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.267
So this is all an accident?

35:35.301 --> 35:37.169
- The flaw was in the machine.
- Well, how can you figure

35:37.203 --> 35:39.338
that out if you never even
saw the trick being performed?

35:39.371 --> 35:40.439
We used Design Recovery.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.808
It was originally implemented
to handle secretive

35:42.841 --> 35:45.944
computer software systems
hidden within coding:

35:45.977 --> 35:47.946
illusions,
ghosts in the machine.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.948
To a first-time viewer,

35:49.981 --> 35:52.284
a staple looks like
a tiny piece of metal

35:52.318 --> 35:54.186
holding your papers together.

35:54.220 --> 35:57.356
But pry it loose
and study its dimensions,

35:57.389 --> 35:59.591
how it bends,
you realize at some point

35:59.625 --> 36:01.360
it changed shape
to achieve its goal.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.195
Put it under
a microscope

36:03.229 --> 36:04.496
and you see telltale signs

36:04.530 --> 36:06.798
that it was attached
to others of its kind.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.467
Without seeing
the staple's origin,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.936
we reverse engineer
the unseen machine that put

36:10.969 --> 36:12.371
our tiny little piece
of metal to work.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.207
Most likely,
Talma climbed in,

36:15.241 --> 36:16.475
and then someone else

36:16.508 --> 36:18.944
started Aquarius.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.613
However, the water
filled up too quickly

36:21.647 --> 36:23.215
and she slammed her head

36:23.249 --> 36:24.550
against the glass
on the inside.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.653
Added to the blood loss,
it knocked her unconscious.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.221
Which is why she never engaged

36:29.255 --> 36:30.989
any of the security devices
inside the machine.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.958
DON: Yeah, it doesn't explain
the handle,

36:32.991 --> 36:34.393
the fracture,
the other person,

36:34.426 --> 36:36.495
why they didn't let her out...

36:36.528 --> 36:37.363
We think they tried.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.897
They pulled the handle,
but that failed.

36:38.930 --> 36:39.998
CHARLIE:
Yeah, they tried

36:40.031 --> 36:41.600
another way: brute force.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.302
We found this fracture

36:43.335 --> 36:46.405
in the exact structurally
weakest place.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.639
It wasn't Talma's head
that cracked the glass,

36:47.673 --> 36:50.309
it was probably somebody
with a sledgehammer.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.710
So all the signs of attempted
murder were actually

36:51.743 --> 36:53.312
evidence that someone
tried to save her.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.814
Yeah, and there was only one
person, other than Talma,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.883
that had inside knowledge
about this trick--

36:57.916 --> 36:59.818
the man who built it.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.493
COLBY: Magicians have something
against track lighting or what?

37:07.526 --> 37:09.261
This place is a
lot less threatening

37:09.295 --> 37:09.895
during the day, trust me.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.865
DAVID:
Jones?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.936
Don't make us have
to come get you!

37:37.323 --> 37:39.925
*

37:52.338 --> 37:53.905
NIKKI (hushed):
I think we got him.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.738
What's the matter,
there was no bed to hide under?

38:26.772 --> 38:28.574
Got him.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.975
Tried so hard
to get her out.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.677
You got to believe me.

38:31.710 --> 38:35.481
An artisan's worst nightmare
is to have a trick go wrong.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.550
You gave us Jenny Calandro,
knowing she was innocent.

38:38.584 --> 38:39.851
Why didn't you
tell us before?

38:39.885 --> 38:40.986
I wanted to, it's just...

38:41.019 --> 38:43.355
she was out cold,

38:43.389 --> 38:45.591
laying there
as the water killed her.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.025
- The fail-safes...
- We know.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.528
Her chest
stopped moving.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.796
I was inches
away from her

38:50.829 --> 38:52.664
- when she died.
- NIKKI: It was an accident.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.600
All you had to do
was come forward.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.536
Oh, and watch
my entire career,

38:57.569 --> 38:59.671
my greatest invention,
die with her?

38:59.705 --> 39:02.741
Nobody buys illusions
that kill you for real.

39:09.615 --> 39:12.451
ALAN:
So, hmm, how was that?

39:12.484 --> 39:13.985
Well...

39:14.019 --> 39:15.754
to be honest, Mom's was better.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.922
Oh, come on.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.590
- It's the same recipe.
- I'm just saying.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.559
That's all, I'm just saying.

39:21.927 --> 39:25.163
Hey, listen, Donny,
um... do you feel

39:25.196 --> 39:26.965
like I cheated you
out of something?

39:28.667 --> 39:30.969
We were never
a religious family.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.671
It's not
about that.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.706
I just... I always used to know

39:34.740 --> 39:38.544
exactly what I was doing,
why I was doing it,

39:38.577 --> 39:41.179
you know, what
I wanted and...

39:41.212 --> 39:44.550
I just... I feel
like I'm missing something.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.718
So, you, um...

39:46.752 --> 39:49.655
you think, uh, you'll find it
by going to temple?

39:49.688 --> 39:51.156
I don't know.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.724
I just know where it's not.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.125
You know, it's not in the job.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.561
I know, but I...
I never...

39:55.594 --> 39:59.130
taught you about,
you know, God and...

39:59.164 --> 40:00.799
or gave you that choice.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.033
No, you did.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.636
You know, look
where I'm looking for it.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.071
Right.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.642
So, um... that's it?

40:10.676 --> 40:11.910
That's all I got.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.512
I cooked,
you do the dishes.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.913
(grumbling)
Don't look at your phone

40:14.946 --> 40:16.748
as if it's gonna
ring and save you.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.183
Just do the dishes.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.523
This is hardly a
romantic spot.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.757
It's not a romantic spot.

40:25.791 --> 40:26.625
It's a learning spot.

40:26.658 --> 40:27.726
Help me with this.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.728
Amita?

40:29.761 --> 40:33.231
I want to show you
what I see in magic.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.900
- Uh, I see a harness.
- Yes.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.968
Um...

40:37.002 --> 40:39.004
go over there
to the switchboard.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.074
Flip switch seven.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.876
Uh, hey, are we sure
this is safe?

40:44.910 --> 40:47.646
Well, we know the design
better than anybody.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.647
(clanging, rumbling)

40:48.680 --> 40:49.648
*

40:49.681 --> 40:50.916
Eight.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.752
* The world and everything...

40:53.785 --> 40:55.721
Nine.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.957
Ten.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.227
*

41:07.966 --> 41:13.238
* At least they have
the stars... *

41:13.271 --> 41:15.807
Do you see it yet?

41:15.841 --> 41:16.775
* Tonight

41:16.808 --> 41:26.251
* At least they have
the stars tonight *

41:26.284 --> 41:36.795
* At least they have the stars
tonight. *
