WEBVTT

00:00.596 --> 00:02.775
- What's her name?
- Rose Stagg.

00:02.816 --> 00:04.529
She's the woman we've
been searching for.

00:04.550 --> 00:06.333
The gunshot wound that's coming in,

00:06.608 --> 00:09.255
- we think he's responsible for this.
- How's he doing?

00:09.375 --> 00:11.851
I don't know. He's lost so much blood,

00:11.879 --> 00:15.382
- he looks like he's dying.
- So he's the Belfast Strangler?

00:16.344 --> 00:19.745
- Wow.
- Daddy's been in an accident.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.610
He's in hospital.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.180
- I really want to see him.
- Well, we can't, not tonight.

00:25.184 --> 00:26.440
Olivia!

00:26.721 --> 00:28.314
Why did you run to him?

00:28.336 --> 00:30.207
You were crying out, "We're losing him."

00:30.240 --> 00:32.159
You sounded very... anguished.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.640
I want him to live.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.633
So that he can be tried and sentenced

00:36.650 --> 00:38.760
and spend the rest
of his life in prison.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.546
He's in hospital.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.809
In the General Hospital, I think.

00:42.929 --> 00:44.369
I really need you to go there.

00:44.489 --> 00:46.694
What do I... ? I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

00:53.714 --> 00:56.028
_

00:57.071 --> 00:58.600
You shouldn't be in here.

01:00.772 --> 01:02.048
Please leave.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.166
What are you doing here?

04:19.166 --> 04:20.769
I'm on my way to the Policing Board.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.688
I have a meeting with Ombudsman's SIO.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.747
We can drop you off.

04:25.969 --> 04:27.760
- No, I have my car.
- It can follow.

04:54.132 --> 04:55.508
I've been instructed to confirm

04:55.525 --> 04:57.223
Spector's name to the press.

04:58.755 --> 05:00.869
- Why?
- The name is out there.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.459
It'll just look foolish if
we continue to deny something

05:04.476 --> 05:06.440
that everybody else already knows.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.565
The DPP and the Chief

05:08.576 --> 05:10.290
think it's in the public's interest.

05:12.887 --> 05:15.257
I want him tried in a
court of law, Jim, not in

05:15.279 --> 05:16.733
a court of public opinion.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.787
It's already a media circus.

05:19.541 --> 05:20.707
Anyway,

05:21.661 --> 05:23.237
the decision's been made.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.265
We're only holding two cards, Stella.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.834
One: we have him.

05:31.106 --> 05:33.550
Two: we have her, and she's alive.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.086
The rest is a disaster.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.381
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

05:41.280 --> 05:42.851
Actually, no.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.553
The Task Force is being moved.

05:47.035 --> 05:48.400
What do you mean?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.342
From the Major Investigation Room,

05:50.947 --> 05:52.600
from College Square Station.

05:53.455 --> 05:54.400
Why?

05:54.400 --> 05:56.223
The room and the offices

05:56.240 --> 05:58.698
are needed by the Terrorist
Investigations Unit.

06:01.655 --> 06:03.803
- Moved where?
- I don't know.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.217
It's an office, an empty
space, I haven't seen it.

06:06.716 --> 06:08.240
When is this happening?

06:08.240 --> 06:10.468
Right now, actually, as we speak.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.395
Why wasn't I informed?

06:15.423 --> 06:17.121
There's been quite a lot going on.

06:38.757 --> 06:41.970
Katie, you'll be late for school!

07:17.670 --> 07:20.100
Why did you bring
Anderson onto your team?

07:21.088 --> 07:22.503
Why do you ask?

07:22.797 --> 07:24.734
Because it's a question
that's likely to be asked

07:24.734 --> 07:26.277
by people other than me.

07:28.369 --> 07:31.160
Because we lacked someone of
his rank in our Task Force.

07:31.343 --> 07:32.475
Yes, but...

07:33.080 --> 07:34.062
why him?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.860
He impressed me with the way he handled

07:35.865 --> 07:37.236
the McPherson suicide.

07:37.469 --> 07:40.221
He thought of Rose, he
called the Task Force and...

07:41.153 --> 07:42.951
... he secured the scene efficiently.

07:42.968 --> 07:44.605
Except that it wasn't Rose,

07:44.866 --> 07:46.425
and he failed to see a ligature

07:46.431 --> 07:48.745
hanging from a tree
branch above the body.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.447
I didn't say he was the
finished article, Jim,

07:51.447 --> 07:52.718
I saw potential.

07:54.188 --> 07:55.520
I see.

07:59.998 --> 08:01.435
What are you getting at?

08:02.760 --> 08:04.177
I questioned

08:04.360 --> 08:06.330
whether Anderson was man enough

08:06.360 --> 08:08.661
for the task of being
shackled to Spector!

08:10.569 --> 08:13.539
Anderson's size and strength

08:13.659 --> 08:15.570
had no bearing whatsoever

08:15.592 --> 08:17.318
on what happened in the forest.

08:17.438 --> 08:20.026
If the nerve damage to
his arm doesn't repair,

08:20.059 --> 08:21.640
he will be out of a career.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.688
Questioning his manliness

08:23.699 --> 08:26.101
is quite frankly pathetic!

08:29.159 --> 08:31.634
Why did he arrive with you
in your car that morning?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.967
- Eastwood.
- No.

08:40.595 --> 08:41.999
No, not Eastwood.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.808
I checked with the main gate.

08:43.841 --> 08:44.935
Why?

08:45.055 --> 08:46.710
Because everything you do,

08:47.448 --> 08:49.063
every decision you make

08:49.091 --> 08:51.133
impacts on this case, Stella.

08:53.847 --> 08:55.640
Same goes for you, Jim.

09:13.973 --> 09:15.133
Drive on.

09:31.714 --> 09:33.074
Why aren't you in uniform?

09:33.296 --> 09:34.628
I have an exam.

09:34.684 --> 09:36.382
You don't have to wear
a uniform to an exam.

09:36.404 --> 09:38.080
You can't go out dressed like that.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.360
- Come here.
- I'm late.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.991
What is that?

09:43.718 --> 09:45.815
Oh, my God, is that real?

09:45.935 --> 09:48.490
- Of course it's real.
- When did you do that?

09:48.751 --> 09:50.440
- Just now.
- Why?

09:51.053 --> 09:52.235
Why not?

09:52.540 --> 09:54.410
Katie, it looks awful.

09:55.142 --> 09:56.920
That's all you ever
care about, isn't it?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.122
How I look,

09:58.242 --> 09:59.609
never how I feel.

10:02.821 --> 10:04.009
Katie!

10:14.201 --> 10:15.760
Have you given your statement?

10:16.050 --> 10:17.287
Yes, ma'am.

10:17.504 --> 10:18.780
How did it go?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.856
I've been suspended from
all front-line duties

10:20.878 --> 10:22.437
while the investigation is ongoing.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.930
He was armed.

10:25.368 --> 10:26.772
And he fired first.

10:27.432 --> 10:29.502
And given his character and his past,

10:29.513 --> 10:31.683
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.480
Apart from taking another
human being's life.

10:38.108 --> 10:39.855
Not every woman's fighting instinct

10:39.855 --> 10:41.631
is so close to the surface.

10:42.502 --> 10:44.400
It's a good thing that yours was.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.842
Tyler could have killed everyone there,

10:46.864 --> 10:49.411
including you and me, if
he hadn't been stopped.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.426
Why don't you come back,

10:57.075 --> 10:58.829
work with the Task Force?

11:00.488 --> 11:02.663
- Really?
- Hmm.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.383
You know the case.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.703
You'd be a real help
in file preparation.

11:08.496 --> 11:10.288
We've chosen to work in a masculine,

11:10.305 --> 11:12.635
paramilitary, patriarchal culture.

11:13.556 --> 11:15.437
Let's not let it beat us.

11:18.977 --> 11:20.375
Thank you, ma'am.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.429
How is he?

11:31.549 --> 11:32.971
He's been stable all night.

11:33.238 --> 11:36.160
Urine output steady, 30% oxygen...

11:36.280 --> 11:38.958
pH is normal, lactate is one.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.880
Hb was steady. What's his co-ag now?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.880
Normal, Hb is 102.

11:44.075 --> 11:45.495
He's ready to rock.

11:45.795 --> 11:46.988
When will you be taking him?

11:47.108 --> 11:48.875
He's booked on the emergency list.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.023
- Has he been X-rayed?
- Aye.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.953
Are they bullet fragments?

11:57.987 --> 12:01.271
- Will you do anything about them?
- No, I wouldn't normally. They're tiny.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.069
They won't clinically affect him.

12:03.074 --> 12:04.920
I expect the body to encapsulate them.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.680
- I should think about ten o'clock.
- Aye.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.548
Please wait here.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.872
Good afternoon and welcome
to this private session

12:42.874 --> 12:44.561
of the Policing Executive.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.920
I'd like to welcome the Chief Constable

12:47.040 --> 12:50.354
and the Assistant Chief
Constable Crime Operations,

12:50.365 --> 12:51.564
Jim Burns.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.966
We'll start with Executive
members' questions

12:54.972 --> 12:56.392
to the Chief Constable.

12:56.708 --> 12:59.480
- John Porter, please.
- Thank you, Chairperson.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.471
Can the Chief Constable please
provide us with an update

13:02.532 --> 13:06.217
on the progress of the
Operation Music Man Task Force?

13:08.587 --> 13:12.066
I'd like to invite ACC
Burns to answer that one.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.197
Detective Superintendent Gibson?

13:18.317 --> 13:20.933
I'm Joan Kinkead, The Ombudsman's SIO.

13:21.053 --> 13:22.187
Please follow me.

13:25.822 --> 13:27.454
Please, take a seat.

13:28.702 --> 13:31.000
Am I being interviewed under caution?

13:31.466 --> 13:32.942
Yes, you are.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.120
Why wasn't I told in advance?

13:35.240 --> 13:38.200
You're not under arrest. You're free
to leave the interview at any time,

13:38.320 --> 13:40.080
seek legal advice at any time.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.997
Do you want time to prepare?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.446
To arrange representation?

13:45.561 --> 13:47.303
Are you suggesting there are grounds

13:47.309 --> 13:49.784
for suspecting I've
committed a criminal offence?

13:51.570 --> 13:53.096
If so, what offence?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.587
If you're staying,

13:55.793 --> 13:58.257
please take a seat and
turn off your mobile phone.

14:00.098 --> 14:01.486
What offence?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.809
James Tyler had been physically violent

14:04.826 --> 14:06.358
towards the prisoner before.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.483
He had become obsessed, it seems,

14:08.494 --> 14:10.431
with the idea that the
prisoner and his wife

14:10.440 --> 14:13.043
were having some kind of
sexual relationship, something

14:13.243 --> 14:15.080
that we now believe to be untrue.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.419
Even so, even given James Tyler's
history of sectarian violence,

14:19.436 --> 14:22.671
there was no evidence or
intelligence to suggest that...

14:22.791 --> 14:25.840
that he would go to such lengths
to mount an attack on the prisoner.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.842
Even though you knew he was
in possession of a weapon?

14:29.200 --> 14:31.462
Having previously
disarmed a police officer

14:31.462 --> 14:33.800
- and stolen a police handgun.
- Even so.

14:34.608 --> 14:38.332
Well, can you tell me
how that's even possible,

14:38.748 --> 14:42.139
with a coiled lanyard attaching
the gun to the gun belt?

14:44.281 --> 14:46.839
The young officer in question
had, for some reason...

14:48.814 --> 14:51.339
... failed to secure
his gun with the lanyard.

14:55.523 --> 14:58.287
The Police Ombudsman
investigates all discharges

14:58.298 --> 15:00.640
of firearms by police
in Northern Ireland.

15:00.806 --> 15:03.309
During the investigation
I'll secure statements

15:03.331 --> 15:05.440
from the officers
involved in the incident.

15:05.618 --> 15:07.188
Now, as I understand it,

15:07.308 --> 15:10.124
you were in charge of
the police operation?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.899
Yes, I was.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.745
Do you think a sufficiently
robust risk assessment

15:15.762 --> 15:17.976
was carried out before
the prisoner was moved

15:18.031 --> 15:19.463
from the custody suite?

15:21.040 --> 15:23.537
I asked Custody Sergeant Boyd

15:23.825 --> 15:27.038
to do a risk assessment of
the operation while I briefed

15:27.088 --> 15:28.792
Detective Sergeant Anderson.

15:31.644 --> 15:34.086
Do you think the operation was negligent

15:34.108 --> 15:35.385
in any way?

15:37.626 --> 15:41.333
The prisoner gave us no
real information in advance,

15:41.921 --> 15:45.083
gave us no indication whether
Rose was alive or dead.

15:45.450 --> 15:47.553
On that basis the search scenario

15:47.565 --> 15:49.784
that was agreed with
Ged Green, the PolSA,

15:49.904 --> 15:52.647
was for the whole, alive or deceased,

15:52.692 --> 15:55.439
non-concealed presence of Rose Stagg.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.359
If that did not succeed,

15:57.387 --> 15:59.695
it was agreed that we
would search the same area

15:59.717 --> 16:01.471
for the deceased, dismembered,

16:01.498 --> 16:05.249
sub-surface concealed
remains of Rose Stagg.

16:06.381 --> 16:08.190
We had cover on the ground,

16:08.251 --> 16:10.926
there was air support
with thermal imaging.

16:11.902 --> 16:14.083
There wasn't time to arrange for dogs.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.778
Do you have your decision log with you?

16:18.789 --> 16:20.210
Yes.

16:20.909 --> 16:22.923
I've been policing for nearly 30 years,

16:22.962 --> 16:24.754
most of it here in Northern Ireland.

16:25.336 --> 16:27.782
Now, we've had more than
our fair share of murderers,

16:27.805 --> 16:30.800
some of them no doubt
psychopaths, but none...

16:31.939 --> 16:33.509
none like this prisoner.

16:34.963 --> 16:37.971
Stella Gibson had - and still has -

16:38.287 --> 16:39.857
a special skill set

16:39.891 --> 16:41.982
developed over the course
of the long investigation

16:41.994 --> 16:43.703
into the Moon case that she led.

16:44.729 --> 16:47.876
She is a dedicated and
hard-working officer,

16:48.353 --> 16:50.151
and an inspirational leader.

16:50.739 --> 16:52.415
I kept in constant contact

16:52.421 --> 16:54.901
with ACC Burns and DCI Eastwood

16:54.912 --> 16:56.383
in the Serious Crime Suite.

16:56.411 --> 16:58.181
It was previously agreed that the convoy

16:58.203 --> 17:00.922
would be kept small so that
it didn't attract attention.

17:01.271 --> 17:05.172
An ambulance, a second police
car and Inspector Green's TSGs

17:05.291 --> 17:08.352
joined us at a previously
agreed rendezvous point.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.512
It is possible that we could have

17:12.741 --> 17:16.181
established a more secure
cordon in the forest,

17:16.231 --> 17:17.801
but everything that was done

17:17.819 --> 17:20.859
was for the sole aim
of saving, if possible,

17:21.432 --> 17:23.180
the life of Rose Stagg.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.547
Who's that?

17:38.873 --> 17:41.848
- Who is that?
- It's just a patient. Road traffic accident.

17:42.463 --> 17:43.906
Who was it?

17:44.755 --> 17:46.559
OK, just relax now.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.612
OK, everything's fine, lie back.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.405
OK, lie down for me.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.930
Come on, lie down and relax.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.787
Just lie back, you're fine, I'm here.

17:55.907 --> 17:57.174
I need you to do

17:57.196 --> 18:00.153
a few big, deep breaths for
me, OK? Through your nose.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
In nice and deep, and out. Very good.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.320
There she is.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.380
Why did you go into
the forest on your own?

18:11.801 --> 18:14.187
I wanted to keep the
potential contamination

18:14.187 --> 18:15.686
of the scene to a minimum.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.725
At the car, why didn't you wait

18:18.737 --> 18:20.429
to have it assessed for booby traps?

18:20.451 --> 18:22.272
Were you not taking a considerable risk

18:22.277 --> 18:23.637
in forcing it open?

18:24.857 --> 18:27.694
The individual charged is a murderer,

18:28.121 --> 18:29.730
not a terrorist.

18:31.639 --> 18:33.870
I knew that Rose was in that boot.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.106
I don't know how I knew, I just knew.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.023
And I needed to get to her.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.058
Would it not have been better

18:44.713 --> 18:47.160
to try and get into the
boot through the rear seat?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.942
In that moment, it didn't occur to me.

19:03.864 --> 19:07.440
The ED consultant told
me, that in his opinion,

19:08.042 --> 19:11.389
Rose Stagg was very nearly
dead when we found her.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.714
Maybe 15 minutes,

19:14.219 --> 19:17.642
maybe an hour away from her
body simply shutting down.

19:21.217 --> 19:23.031
Everything that I did

19:24.418 --> 19:27.465
was done for the sole
purpose of saving her life...

19:28.935 --> 19:30.572
which is, as you know,

19:30.988 --> 19:33.075
the first duty of a police officer.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.020
And what about Mr Spector's life?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.200
Did you not have a duty to protect that?

19:48.825 --> 19:50.760
OK, we are going to have
to soak this, please.

19:58.175 --> 20:00.029
We had four packs in here, right?

20:00.149 --> 20:01.571
Yes, that's right.

20:03.653 --> 20:05.040
One...

20:08.397 --> 20:09.760
... two...

20:10.728 --> 20:12.947
Did you draw your weapon?

20:13.652 --> 20:15.072
I didn't need to.

20:16.914 --> 20:18.462
The patrol officer

20:18.873 --> 20:20.432
acted immediately.

20:21.204 --> 20:22.807
And if it wasn't for her...

20:23.922 --> 20:26.108
many more lives would have been lost.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.567
I instructed

20:28.590 --> 20:31.198
Inspector Green to call
for medical back-up.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.505
The prisoner was dying.

20:35.769 --> 20:38.167
The ambulance transporting
Rose had already left,

20:38.184 --> 20:39.893
I didn't think it should be recalled.

20:40.013 --> 20:41.796
The helicopter couldn't land.

20:42.623 --> 20:44.646
We waited for the rapid response vehicle

20:44.649 --> 20:46.280
and for the second ambulance.

20:48.106 --> 20:50.320
Meanwhile, the prisoner
was bleeding to death.

20:52.101 --> 20:54.143
He was in your arms?

20:55.400 --> 20:56.951
Yes, he was.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.958
I hoped that

21:01.390 --> 21:04.486
by holding him that way I
could keep his airway unblocked,

21:04.542 --> 21:05.907
keep him from choking.

21:06.983 --> 21:09.747
In that position, I could
put pressure on his wound.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.310
I see.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.360
How much longer?

21:17.927 --> 21:19.686
Diaphragm is stable.

21:22.694 --> 21:24.342
OK, I'm running the gut.

21:26.883 --> 21:28.764
I can't see any re-bleeding.

21:32.288 --> 21:33.960
OK, that's all fine.

21:38.087 --> 21:39.974
All right, wash out, please.

21:40.889 --> 21:42.182
And suction.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.634
You knew

21:45.867 --> 21:48.991
James Tyler had made threats
against Mr Spector's life.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.571
You knew he was at large

21:51.593 --> 21:53.947
armed with a gun he'd
used to terrorise his wife

21:53.952 --> 21:55.595
and the other women at the refuge.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.990
Why was Mr Spector standing out

21:59.001 --> 22:01.877
in the open and not being
held inside a police vehicle?

22:02.898 --> 22:05.717
Why were neither he nor
Detective Sergeant Anderson

22:05.755 --> 22:07.465
wearing ballistic body armour?

22:07.659 --> 22:08.985
Why weren't you?

22:11.044 --> 22:13.819
The Director of Public
Prosecutions George Lowden

22:13.842 --> 22:16.084
and the Chief Constable Malcolm Franks

22:16.204 --> 22:18.509
have decided to take the unusual step

22:18.629 --> 22:21.173
of naming the man arrested and charged

22:21.195 --> 22:24.520
in connection with the recent
spate of murders in south Belfast.

22:24.719 --> 22:28.348
I can confirm that the
individual is Paul Spector,

22:28.681 --> 22:30.729
also known as Peter Baldwin,

22:30.849 --> 22:34.481
a 32-year-old bereavement
counsellor from south Belfast.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.290
He is a married man,

22:36.484 --> 22:38.276
the father of two children,

22:38.326 --> 22:40.435
and as has already been established,

22:40.462 --> 22:43.087
he is critically ill
in hospital as a result

22:43.087 --> 22:46.744
of an incident that took
place whilst in police custody.

23:38.294 --> 23:39.520
How'd the re-look go?

23:39.948 --> 23:41.279
The abdominal packs were removed.

23:41.290 --> 23:42.605
There was no active bleeding.

23:42.617 --> 23:44.913
The abdomen was closed with
standard mass closure to the sheath

23:44.919 --> 23:47.205
and routine skin closure with staples.

23:48.665 --> 23:50.795
Let's lighten him up. What's he on?

23:50.856 --> 23:54.091
Propofol is at 10ml an
hour and alfentanil is at 5.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.337
Chip away at the propofol.

24:03.711 --> 24:06.080
_

24:09.000 --> 24:11.375
_

24:18.346 --> 24:20.742
_

24:34.919 --> 24:37.048
_

24:42.720 --> 24:44.120
Who is this?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.345
Katie? It's Olivia.

24:46.389 --> 24:48.088
Do you know what happened to Daddy?

24:49.556 --> 24:50.832
No.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.095
Do you?

24:52.157 --> 24:53.999
He's in hospital, I think.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.055
- Have you been to see him?
- No.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.346
Do you have a friend called Daisy?

24:59.931 --> 25:01.493
Why?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.858
There's something about her online.

25:04.113 --> 25:07.194
- What?
- How she met Daddy one time.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.128
- What?
- What are you two doing?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.767
You know you're not allowed
to use the staff phone.

25:14.949 --> 25:16.511
Right, come on with me.

25:18.515 --> 25:22.281
_

25:22.336 --> 25:25.834
_

25:33.222 --> 25:39.109
_

25:54.613 --> 25:57.668
We're thinking of putting
two more over there.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.779
There are two offices, ma'am.

26:09.810 --> 26:11.634
I've earmarked one for you.

26:11.932 --> 26:14.366
The contents of your old
office are still in boxes.

26:14.486 --> 26:16.545
I'll have them brought in.

26:17.111 --> 26:18.991
It's less of a dungeon.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.679
- Mmm.
- We'll make it work.

26:45.311 --> 26:46.720
Paul?

26:48.803 --> 26:51.112
Paul, can you open your eyes for me?

26:51.853 --> 26:53.272
Paul...

26:53.880 --> 26:55.973
Paul, open your eyes for me.

26:56.757 --> 26:59.197
Paul, can you open your eyes for me?

27:02.209 --> 27:05.135
OK, that's good, that's very good.

27:12.577 --> 27:14.593
I need some help in here!

27:15.894 --> 27:17.525
I need some help!

27:23.007 --> 27:24.351
I got him.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.654
He's biting down on his tube!

27:29.991 --> 27:32.654
His sats are dropping,
he needs sedation.

27:40.652 --> 27:42.058
Ahhh.

27:49.165 --> 27:51.618
Increase oxygen to 100%.

28:20.147 --> 28:22.879
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, of course.

28:30.361 --> 28:32.320
Well, that was a wake up with a bang.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.240
- Rose, what are you doing?
- I want to go home.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.739
You're scheduled to be
moved to another ward later.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.123
No, no, I want to go home.
I want to call my husband.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.560
I want some clothes.

28:54.616 --> 28:56.545
- Calm...
- I want to go home!

28:58.424 --> 29:01.063
- I want to go home.
- OK.

29:29.867 --> 29:32.201
I've just seen Katie
Benedetto approaching the ICU.

29:32.207 --> 29:33.458
Copy that.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.194
Maybe there's been some cerebral damage

29:41.213 --> 29:43.061
from the prolonged hypotension.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.629
I'm not sure we can MRI
with the bullet fragments.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.454
We'll keep him asleep
and arrange a CT scan.

29:50.516 --> 29:53.062
Check all his lines, check
everything is still in place,

29:53.087 --> 29:54.848
that he hasn't burst his stitches.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.221
Are you OK? Did he hurt you?

29:58.476 --> 29:59.727
No, I'm fine.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.276
Mrs Spector.

30:32.494 --> 30:35.307
Come on in, the head wants to see you.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.080
Olivia admits accessing a school
computer without permission,

30:44.625 --> 30:47.525
and she was found using
a staff-only phone.

30:48.204 --> 30:50.886
I've had parents contacting
the school all day long,

30:51.006 --> 30:53.114
even before the announcement was made.

30:53.874 --> 30:56.164
Staff are deeply concerned.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.166
Olivia and Liam have already
been on the receiving end of...

31:00.913 --> 31:03.480
unkind comments from other pupils.

31:05.842 --> 31:08.456
I have to put their welfare first.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.946
The last thing I want is for them

31:10.965 --> 31:12.640
to be vilified for something that...

31:13.852 --> 31:15.327
For something that may
or may not have been done

31:15.342 --> 31:16.771
by one of their parents.

31:19.001 --> 31:21.615
I... I've never been
in this position before.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.577
I don't know anyone who has.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.832
Maybe in the past,

31:26.867 --> 31:28.132
during the Troubles.

31:29.222 --> 31:31.064
Perhaps if you kept them at home,

31:31.338 --> 31:32.840
for even a few days,

31:33.115 --> 31:34.680
so we could take stock.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.889
I can discuss the situation
with the governors.

31:40.851 --> 31:42.191
I'm sorry.

32:13.756 --> 32:16.579
I apologise for the move.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.691
Not my idea.

32:22.161 --> 32:23.999
Please be aware:

32:24.163 --> 32:27.987
disclosure rules mean
that every DNA lift,

32:28.007 --> 32:29.888
every scene-of-crime log,

32:29.898 --> 32:31.900
every crime scene shot,

32:31.915 --> 32:34.265
every entry in a notebook

32:35.266 --> 32:37.616
must be kept to comply with the

32:37.695 --> 32:40.374
retention of materials guidelines.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.620
I want records right down to

32:44.904 --> 32:46.607
when and at what time

32:46.617 --> 32:49.280
officers changed their forensic capes.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.710
We cannot give the defence

32:51.740 --> 32:55.803
any chance of challenging the
continuity of our exhibits.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.959
Organisation

32:59.476 --> 33:02.200
is crucially important

33:02.374 --> 33:05.098
to the next stage of our investigations:

33:05.916 --> 33:07.817
case construction.

33:08.838 --> 33:12.294
I don't know what's going
to happen with Spector,

33:12.314 --> 33:15.401
or how long it will take him
to recover from his injuries...

33:16.560 --> 33:19.140
but we cannot take our foot

33:19.145 --> 33:20.708
off the gas for a minute.

33:21.027 --> 33:22.725
We need to look for

33:22.730 --> 33:25.000
as much further evidence as we can...

33:26.638 --> 33:28.695
... to corroborate our account

33:28.989 --> 33:32.080
and construct an
evidenced case narrative.

33:32.932 --> 33:35.053
We need to predict any potential

33:35.173 --> 33:37.094
weaknesses in our case

33:37.109 --> 33:39.758
and plug any gaps with evidence.

33:39.773 --> 33:40.839
Real evidence,

33:41.103 --> 33:43.826
documentary evidence,
circumstantial evidence,

33:43.886 --> 33:45.549
witness testimonies.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.360
Evidence that carries weight.

33:50.837 --> 33:52.460
Mistakes have been made.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.064
No more mistakes.

34:03.607 --> 34:05.760
What's happening with Rose's car?

34:06.331 --> 34:08.835
It's been recovered and
it's being worked on.

34:09.253 --> 34:11.887
It's been processed for
DNA and trace evidence.

34:12.101 --> 34:14.159
They're dusting for prints tomorrow.

34:18.896 --> 34:21.610
It seems a man has come forward

34:21.610 --> 34:24.400
having seen Spector's
photograph on the news.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.012
He says Spector looks
like a man who rents

34:27.016 --> 34:29.178
a lock-up from him in east Belfast,

34:30.179 --> 34:32.150
under the name Baldwin.

34:34.589 --> 34:36.377
Let's get a warrant for that.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.520
Paul?

34:40.022 --> 34:41.376
Paul?

34:42.860 --> 34:44.523
Paul, can you hear me?

34:46.284 --> 34:48.789
Paul, I'm Kiera, I'm your nurse.

34:50.313 --> 34:51.641
Can you hear me?

34:55.809 --> 34:58.349
OK, I'm going to say
a series of letters.

34:59.469 --> 35:01.381
And I want you to squeeze my hand

35:01.600 --> 35:03.303
whenever I say the letter A.

35:03.741 --> 35:06.325
Every time I say the letter A, OK?

35:09.791 --> 35:11.000
S.

35:11.847 --> 35:12.992
A.

35:15.482 --> 35:16.741
V.

35:17.737 --> 35:18.952
E.

35:20.614 --> 35:21.894
A.

35:24.657 --> 35:25.941
H.

35:27.663 --> 35:28.963
A.

35:30.466 --> 35:31.781
R.

35:33.712 --> 35:34.932
T.

35:37.451 --> 35:39.727
OK, that's good. That's very good, Paul.

35:42.899 --> 35:45.149
Now hold up this many fingers.

35:51.761 --> 35:52.837
OK.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.008
And now with the other hand.

36:04.358 --> 36:06.563
And now add one more finger.

36:13.010 --> 36:15.868
OK, that's good. That's very good, Paul.

36:44.352 --> 36:45.418
Cuff down.

36:48.968 --> 36:50.160
OK.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.836
And back down.

37:28.008 --> 37:29.198
Gibson.

37:29.318 --> 37:31.184
- It's Hagstrom, ma'am.
- Yeah?

37:31.463 --> 37:33.813
It seems Spector's
regained consciousness.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.550
There's a lot of coming and going.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.880
I'm told...

37:37.000 --> 37:38.880
... he's drowsy but alert.

37:39.444 --> 37:40.520
I see.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.796
Thank you.

37:44.035 --> 37:45.190
Keep me posted.

37:45.499 --> 37:46.760
Yes, ma'am.

37:58.012 --> 38:00.320
OK, Paul, I'm just
changing your dressing.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.097
Who are you?

38:04.824 --> 38:05.945
I'm Kiera.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.160
I'm your nurse.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.604
Where am I?

38:10.760 --> 38:13.264
You're in Belfast General Hospital.

38:13.587 --> 38:15.544
You're in the Intensive Care Unit.

38:16.535 --> 38:19.408
You've had an operation but
you're doing really well.

38:20.991 --> 38:22.406
An operation?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.846
Now just sit back.

38:25.856 --> 38:27.600
You're OK, just relax back.

38:28.235 --> 38:29.968
I'll get the doctor to explain more,

38:29.968 --> 38:31.895
but right now just let
me check this wound.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.181
Here you go.

38:48.415 --> 38:49.600
Thanks.

38:52.681 --> 38:54.185
I've been thinking,

38:54.807 --> 38:57.481
you should really arrange for
him to have representation.

38:57.805 --> 38:58.920
A solicitor.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.828
Isn't it too late for that?

39:01.867 --> 39:02.903
Not at all.

39:03.396 --> 39:05.806
Now he's come round,
he needs legal advice.

39:06.831 --> 39:08.280
It's the right thing to do.

39:11.647 --> 39:15.092
Is there someone in your
firm that can represent him?

39:15.401 --> 39:17.129
That would be a conflict of interests,

39:17.492 --> 39:18.812
we represent you.

39:19.877 --> 39:20.944
Besides,

39:21.287 --> 39:22.442
there's really only

39:22.726 --> 39:25.390
one person in Belfast who
can handle a case this big.

39:26.037 --> 39:28.357
I can make the call on your behalf,

39:28.666 --> 39:30.747
but it has to come
from you as next of kin.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.616
Are you going to go and visit Paul?

39:38.490 --> 39:41.437
Don't you think Olivia at
least should go see him?

39:55.642 --> 39:56.852
Lyon & Healy.

39:56.887 --> 39:58.719
Yes, hello, it's Steve Jennings

39:58.734 --> 40:01.080
calling from Simon &
Patrick for Sean Healy.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.642
I'll see if he's available.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.485
Mr Spector?

40:13.039 --> 40:14.160
Mr Spector.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.537
I'm Dr Spencer,

40:19.556 --> 40:21.070
I'm the ICU consultant.

40:23.545 --> 40:24.960
Do you know where you are?

40:29.380 --> 40:31.651
I'm in the Belfast General Hospital.

40:32.284 --> 40:33.440
She told me.

40:35.774 --> 40:37.332
And do you know why you're here?

40:38.826 --> 40:40.612
I was in a car accident.

40:42.699 --> 40:44.080
Do you remember what happened?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.649
Windscreen smashed.

40:51.128 --> 40:52.701
I lost control.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.160
What's your second name?

40:59.826 --> 41:01.051
Peter.

41:01.469 --> 41:02.744
And your surname?

41:06.399 --> 41:07.783
Spector.

41:09.690 --> 41:11.557
Spec-tor.

41:14.321 --> 41:15.710
Where were you born?

41:17.104 --> 41:18.189
No.

41:19.031 --> 41:20.047
No, where?

41:20.117 --> 41:21.451
Where were you born, Paul?

41:22.621 --> 41:23.800
Belfast.

41:26.569 --> 41:27.899
What's your date of birth?

41:27.909 --> 41:28.989
Do you remember that?

41:31.902 --> 41:34.835
25th of the fifth, 1979.

41:36.259 --> 41:37.649
So how old are you?

41:38.868 --> 41:39.880
26.

41:42.699 --> 41:44.142
What year do you think it is?

41:48.181 --> 41:49.475
Um...

41:49.824 --> 41:51.387
it's 2006.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.387
And what season is it?

41:58.294 --> 41:59.360
It's warm.

42:02.012 --> 42:03.312
Are you married?

42:03.432 --> 42:05.640
Um...

42:05.760 --> 42:07.116
Yes.

42:07.648 --> 42:09.028
And what's your wife's name?

42:09.516 --> 42:10.591
Sally.

42:13.066 --> 42:14.564
Do you have any children?

42:16.670 --> 42:17.960
A daughter.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.952
What's her name?

42:21.664 --> 42:22.849
Livy.

42:23.322 --> 42:24.457
Olivia.

42:25.633 --> 42:27.120
And how old is Livy?

42:29.676 --> 42:30.720
Small.

42:41.327 --> 42:42.433
Mummy?

42:42.640 --> 42:43.847
Nancy!

42:44.459 --> 42:46.327
Come here.

42:49.229 --> 42:51.609
Oh, it's so good to see you.

42:52.576 --> 42:54.303
How are you, my angel?

42:54.363 --> 42:55.856
- Good.
- Are you good?

42:56.474 --> 42:59.058
- Did Daddy take care of you?
- Yes.

43:03.041 --> 43:04.240
Thank you.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.159
Are you OK?

43:08.200 --> 43:09.499
What's wrong?

43:13.044 --> 43:14.800
What's happened to all these people?

43:17.709 --> 43:19.397
They're not very well.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.154
That's a shame.

43:22.464 --> 43:23.659
It is.

43:43.865 --> 43:46.760
We've just landed a not
uninteresting little case.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.040
The telephone call?

43:48.516 --> 43:49.681
Do you want in?

43:50.005 --> 43:51.534
Are you going to tell me what it is?

43:52.555 --> 43:54.240
The Belfast Strangler.

43:54.437 --> 43:56.110
Or rather, the man the police claim

43:56.145 --> 43:57.489
is the Belfast Strangler.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.430
- The man in hospital?
- The same.

44:00.526 --> 44:01.960
The name's Paul Spector.

44:02.129 --> 44:03.659
He's in the critical care unit

44:03.669 --> 44:05.496
at the Belfast General Hospital.

44:05.920 --> 44:09.090
Inform the custody sergeant
at the Down Serious Crime Suite

44:09.100 --> 44:11.385
that we've been retained by
the suspect's next of kin,

44:11.415 --> 44:13.451
namely his wife, Sally Anne Spector.

44:13.571 --> 44:15.101
Obtain a copy of the charge sheet

44:15.104 --> 44:16.618
and the custody record.

44:17.693 --> 44:19.520
Jennings says he's confessed.

44:19.739 --> 44:20.531
As soon as you get them,

44:20.536 --> 44:22.418
I want those tapes transcribed.

44:22.443 --> 44:24.106
Through the night, if necessary.

44:27.854 --> 44:29.706
You weren't in a crash, Paul.

44:30.463 --> 44:31.504
You were shot.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.654
Shot in the abdomen.

44:34.625 --> 44:36.646
One of the bullets was superficial,

44:36.646 --> 44:38.169
just below the skin.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.172
The other one pierced the spleen

44:41.854 --> 44:43.452
and we think it probably hit a rib,

44:43.457 --> 44:44.880
because it fragmented.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.057
The organ was so badly damaged,

44:47.072 --> 44:48.197
we had to remove it.

44:49.477 --> 44:52.440
You're very lucky that the
bullets hit no other vital organs,

44:52.440 --> 44:53.998
but all the same,

44:54.466 --> 44:56.089
there was massive blood loss.

44:56.717 --> 44:58.036
It was touch and go.

45:00.675 --> 45:02.069
Why was I shot?

45:02.825 --> 45:04.727
You were in police custody at the time.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.611
What?

45:10.951 --> 45:12.789
Why was I in police custody?

45:14.720 --> 45:16.223
I can't tell you that at the moment,

45:16.228 --> 45:18.090
I genuinely don't know the answer.

45:20.237 --> 45:22.164
It's something you can
discuss with your solicitor

45:22.174 --> 45:23.781
when you're a little stronger.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.038
A solicitor?

45:27.596 --> 45:29.273
Why would I need a solicitor?

45:30.822 --> 45:33.560
We're only here to look
after you medically, Paul.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.314
All right? The rest is best
left to others to explain.

45:48.696 --> 45:51.160
- Gibson.
- It's Hagstrom again, ma'am.

45:51.439 --> 45:52.520
Yep?

45:52.640 --> 45:55.280
Rose Stagg is discharging
herself from the ICU.

45:56.557 --> 45:57.720
What?

45:59.182 --> 46:00.160
Why?

46:00.531 --> 46:01.926
Something spooked her.

46:02.378 --> 46:04.280
She must know Spector's here somehow.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.440
Jesus.

46:07.621 --> 46:09.019
Who's the consultant?

46:09.483 --> 46:11.429
Dr Patrick Spencer, ma'am.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.476
OK, thanks.

46:15.168 --> 46:16.074
Shit.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.482
I just took a call from
Boyd at the custody suite.

46:22.741 --> 46:24.718
It seems that at his wife's request,

46:25.146 --> 46:26.929
Spector now has a solicitor.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.756
Sean Healy.

46:29.742 --> 46:31.673
To my mind, he is an
arrogant, manipulative,

46:31.703 --> 46:33.580
too-clever-by-half bastard.

46:34.730 --> 46:36.015
But he's a winner.

46:37.130 --> 46:39.246
If there is a loophole,
he's going to exploit it.

46:40.167 --> 46:42.616
We can expect turbulence at every turn.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.077
Great!

46:46.705 --> 46:48.099
Ready when you are.

47:23.940 --> 47:25.827
Don't let Liam stay up too late.

47:26.061 --> 47:28.042
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

47:29.879 --> 47:31.667
OK, in you go.

47:36.437 --> 47:37.640
All right, Olivia?

47:38.030 --> 47:40.465
- See you later, cheerio.
- See you later. Thanks.

47:52.410 --> 47:54.346
What do you think has happened to Daddy?

47:55.452 --> 47:56.911
He's been shot.

47:57.254 --> 47:58.608
Who told you that?

47:59.026 --> 48:01.217
Everyone in school was saying it.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.045
Did you see things online?

48:04.598 --> 48:05.469
Yes.

48:06.121 --> 48:07.859
I don't want you doing that, Olivia.

48:07.869 --> 48:09.790
I don't want you going online.

48:10.174 --> 48:11.180
OK.

48:15.481 --> 48:17.360
Did they say why he'd been shot?

48:17.607 --> 48:19.200
They said the police did it.

48:19.370 --> 48:20.440
But why?

48:22.640 --> 48:24.604
Because he's killed people.

48:24.848 --> 48:25.928
People?

48:26.112 --> 48:27.427
Ladies.

48:29.962 --> 48:31.485
Do you believe that?

48:32.352 --> 48:33.477
No.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.699
I just want to see him.

48:42.819 --> 48:45.571
I don't want him to be
frightened and all alone.

48:46.682 --> 48:48.161
Please, Mummy.

49:08.584 --> 49:11.555
- How much is a taxi?
- It'll be, like, a fiver.

49:28.605 --> 49:30.831
What are you doing here?
You missed your exam.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.554
You're a fucking brunette now?

49:32.674 --> 49:34.048
Yeah, why not?

49:34.934 --> 49:37.189
Why have you been
telling lies about Paul?

49:39.116 --> 49:40.400
I haven't.

49:40.400 --> 49:43.019
- You said he left comments on your videos.
- He did.

49:43.294 --> 49:45.280
- You're a liar!
- What?!

49:45.674 --> 49:46.914
You want to see?

49:47.312 --> 49:48.642
I'll show you.

49:50.056 --> 49:52.357
- What is the matter with you?!
- You stay away from him!

49:52.417 --> 49:53.920
I haven't been near him!

49:53.920 --> 49:54.921
You need to get a grip,

49:54.926 --> 49:57.166
you're obsessed, it's pathetic!

50:00.480 --> 50:03.011
- Who's pathetic now?
- My eyes!

50:03.131 --> 50:04.883
- My eyes!
- We need an ambulance!

50:08.995 --> 50:12.147
- My eyes! My eyes!
- Pour some water on her eyes.

50:16.818 --> 50:18.416
I understand you're a nurse?

50:19.272 --> 50:22.070
Your husband was hypotensive
for a good 20 minutes.

50:22.459 --> 50:24.571
He was peri-arrest
for most of that time.

50:24.691 --> 50:26.353
He's able to talk, but...

50:26.473 --> 50:27.980
he's disorientated,

50:28.319 --> 50:29.514
confused.

50:29.897 --> 50:32.925
He doesn't seem to have
remembered what happened to him,

50:33.120 --> 50:34.862
what actually brought him here,

50:35.200 --> 50:37.873
or that he was in
police custody, or why.

50:39.043 --> 50:41.000
I think that explanation is best left

50:41.020 --> 50:42.772
to his solicitor when he's stronger.

50:45.367 --> 50:47.428
Young children can find
it quite distressing

50:47.428 --> 50:49.539
seeing their mummies or daddies in ICU.

50:49.822 --> 50:51.764
Think about that before you take her in.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.419
She wants to see him.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.769
She needs to see him.

51:06.699 --> 51:07.815
Paul?

51:09.831 --> 51:11.997
Your wife and daughter
are here to see you.

51:39.746 --> 51:41.150
Hello, Daddy.

51:44.496 --> 51:46.746
It's me, Daddy. It's me, Olivia.

51:51.197 --> 51:52.160
Sally?

51:57.073 --> 51:58.487
What's happening?

52:00.528 --> 52:02.913
It's all right, Daddy, it's all right.

52:06.228 --> 52:07.538
Why are you so big?

52:11.879 --> 52:13.214
And you?

52:13.791 --> 52:15.200
You look different.

52:16.584 --> 52:17.600
Older.

52:19.458 --> 52:20.840
What's happening to me?

52:43.730 --> 52:46.155
Just be careful of the
tubes in Daddy's arm.

52:55.895 --> 52:57.095
Is it you?

52:59.689 --> 53:01.013
Is it really you?

53:01.571 --> 53:02.801
Yes, Daddy.

53:11.176 --> 53:12.719
I feel that I know you...

53:14.567 --> 53:15.960
... that I love you.

53:16.170 --> 53:17.960
You do love me, Daddy,

53:18.182 --> 53:19.600
and I love you too.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.430
That's it.

54:20.004 --> 54:22.917
That's the stolen vehicle
with the fake plates.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.720
It's Spector's lock-up.

54:37.506 --> 54:40.085
_

55:00.608 --> 55:01.768
Hello?

55:03.236 --> 55:04.705
Is someone there?

55:13.693 --> 55:15.022
Oh, God.

55:20.798 --> 55:24.064
It seems Spector WAS intending
to feed Rose after all.

55:28.829 --> 55:30.656
Maybe that's what he
was doing in the car

55:30.661 --> 55:32.119
on the hillside that night.

55:34.241 --> 55:36.347
Seeing me made him turn back.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.087
And Rose almost died.

55:47.937 --> 55:49.157
Ma'am?

56:19.912 --> 56:21.271
There are images.

56:23.038 --> 56:24.480
Fragments.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.245
Moments of recognition.

56:29.103 --> 56:31.280
I just... can't make sense of anything.

56:34.829 --> 56:36.680
It feels like I've lost my mind.

56:38.623 --> 56:40.346
Just some memories.

56:45.429 --> 56:47.217
She's a lovely wee girl.

56:50.055 --> 56:51.489
You need to sleep.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.522
I'm here if you need anything.

56:55.229 --> 56:56.480
Just sleep now.

57:34.755 --> 57:35.980
Ma'am?

57:42.467 --> 57:43.840
Jesus!

57:50.249 --> 57:51.728
How many are there?

57:52.972 --> 57:54.240
Nine or ten.

57:59.918 --> 58:01.217
More victims?

58:01.287 --> 58:02.736
