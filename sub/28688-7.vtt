WEBVTT

00:04.879 --> 00:06.965
[Lana] Ugh. I'm tired of being out here.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.050
I wanna go home.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.135
Ew, Earth?

00:10.218 --> 00:12.220
In space we can do
whatever the hell we want

00:12.303 --> 00:14.347
with basically no responsibilities.

00:14.431 --> 00:17.559
Kind of my point. Maybe I'm ready
to start having a real life

00:17.642 --> 00:19.561
instead of being stuck here with your ass.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.605
Shh! My ass might hear you,
and it's very sensitive.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.065
Of course, you know that.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.275
Not engaging.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.652
I'm just saying,
maybe it's time to hang this all up and--

00:27.736 --> 00:30.780
Ugh!
Is this about your aching uterus again?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.490
Okay, who said anything about--

00:32.574 --> 00:34.617
Well, we haven't talked about
settling down, but--

00:34.701 --> 00:36.494
-Nope.
-Key word "settling."

00:36.578 --> 00:39.706
I'm down with going to Earth.
I could use some fresh faces to bang.

00:39.789 --> 00:44.294
And our bar stock is so low,
I may have to resort to... beer.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.213
Has everyone gone crazy?
We're on the final frontier

00:47.297 --> 00:51.468
and you want to go back
to doing day jobs and gravity-laden sex?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.845
-Not my first preference.
-I vote with Archer.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.306
-Robots don't get a vote.
-I prefer "synthetic human."

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
[overlapping chatter]

00:57.724 --> 01:00.143
No one gets to vote. I'm the captain.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.394
Co-captain.

01:01.478 --> 01:05.190
And as the other co-captain,
I am setting a course for Earth.

01:05.273 --> 01:09.194
No! Lana! I will not let you
hyperspace us to Boring-town!

01:09.277 --> 01:11.446
[grunting]

01:11.529 --> 01:13.031
-[Lana grunts]
-[Archer] What the-- Ow!

01:14.324 --> 01:16.785
[Pam] Holy spacesnacks!

01:16.868 --> 01:18.620
[Lana] It's a Dri'n battle cruiser.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.916
-And somehow it hasn't noticed us.
-[Cyril] No.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.502
We're too close
for its long-range scanners to pick us up.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.504
Great. Let's just loop around this bad boy

01:27.587 --> 01:29.798
and hyperspace somewhere
that is not Earth.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.259
If we can destroy it, we will cripple
pirate activity in this sector.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.511
Who cares?

01:34.594 --> 01:37.806
And collect a 30 million credit bounty
for taking it out.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.516
As I was saying,

01:39.599 --> 01:43.853
who cares about combatting space piracy
more than me?

01:43.937 --> 01:44.979
Exactly.

01:45.063 --> 01:49.025
The very reasonable reward
is just icing on the cake.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.778
-Guys, as captain of this ship...
-Co-captain.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.030
...I am making an executive decision.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.659
-We're taking out that Dri'n bastard.
-Like I already executively decided.

01:57.742 --> 02:00.203
Hands in. "Space cowboys" on three.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.704
One, two...

02:05.208 --> 02:06.835
What the hell are you doing?

02:08.503 --> 02:11.506
[theme music playing]

02:46.916 --> 02:48.293
[Archer] Okay, here's the plan.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.045
After we board the ship,
knock out a couple of Dri'n guards,

02:51.129 --> 02:54.048
and then-- you'll love this--
put on their clothes--

02:54.132 --> 02:55.216
Not to be a buzzkill,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.802
but you think there'll really be
a plus-sized pirate onboard?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.804
Ugh! This is a horrible plan.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.014
I'm not finished!

03:01.097 --> 03:03.224
Pam, you'll be our "prisoner."

03:03.308 --> 03:05.143
-Sweet!
-Lucky.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.645
-Still, a horrible plan.
-Let me finish!

03:07.729 --> 03:10.815
We'll infiltrate the ship
disguised as Dri'n guards.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.278
-That's it. That's the whole plan.
-This is not a plan.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.780
This is the plot of several famous films!

03:17.864 --> 03:19.616
Well, why do you think
they're famous, Lana?

03:19.699 --> 03:23.411
-We'll need Ray to get us some explosives.
-He's taking a sick day.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.746
-We get those?
-Of course he is.

03:24.829 --> 03:29.292
It's a miracle we don't crash into the sun
with all you Sick Day Cyrils

03:29.375 --> 03:31.169
and Personal Day Pams.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.671
It is a pretty generous package
if you use it right.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.756
Space phrasing.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.591
Well, where am I supposed
to get explosives?

03:36.674 --> 03:39.385
"Thermite" be something I can do to help.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.013
Referencing thermite explosives?

03:42.096 --> 03:43.097
[all groan]

03:43.181 --> 03:45.975
I did not enjoy that.
Does this thing have an off-switch?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.852
Aw. I have feelings.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.812
Volume control? Anything?

03:49.896 --> 03:54.359
Then we'll plant the thermite
all over the ship and <i>hola explosivo.</i>

03:54.442 --> 03:56.778
-I'm confused.
-It's Spanish, Pam.

03:56.861 --> 04:00.281
No! How we'll get the <i>Seamus</i> out of here
without us pinging their scanners.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.866
That's where Cyril and Carol come in.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.661
You two will disable
the radar system on board.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.829
-Whoo-hoo!
-[inhales sharply] Please don't!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.623
I can disable the radar system!

04:08.706 --> 04:10.959
Can you disable yourself?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.961
Beep, bap, boop. Ya burnt.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.005
Why not Krieger? I mean,
he's qualified even if he is a replicant.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.467
Thank you, Lana, but I like to think
I'm more of a Repli-can.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.551
[all groan]

04:20.635 --> 04:23.137
No bots. Mother, you stay and run comms.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.390
Stay here? With the liquor?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.225
Well, if you insist.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.728
Space cowboys, let's ride!

04:31.187 --> 04:33.898
[Lana] Would you stop trying to make
"space cowboys" stick? It isn't.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.525
Fine, Lana. You stay here

04:35.608 --> 04:39.195
and be the world-weary
space saloon/brothel madam.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.571
I wanna be a brothel madam!

04:40.655 --> 04:43.157
Ooh, I-I could be the banker
and wear one of those green visors.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.451
Everybody stop making this stick!

04:45.910 --> 04:47.912
And if anything, I would be co-sheriff.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.123
-That's not a thing.
-The whole thing's not a thing!

04:50.206 --> 04:52.166
[Krieger] Whoa, space cowboys!

04:52.250 --> 04:54.585
-What is it now, Krieger?
-I've got helpful gadgets!

04:54.669 --> 04:58.172
Like these voice changers!
The Dri'n tongue is a beast, you know.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.092
Fine. But honestly, Krieger,
this is all a little thirsty.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.761
-Like Lana's ovaries.
-Not engaging.

05:03.845 --> 05:08.266
Doesn't someone need to be proposing
before you're engaging?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.059
-Not en-- [groans]
-[laughs]

05:10.143 --> 05:12.145
-She totally disarmed your phrase.
-[clicks]

05:12.228 --> 05:14.856
So, what's our plan when these
shitty voice changers don't work?

05:14.939 --> 05:15.940
[Krieger] I can hear you.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.526
Well, I picked up some phrases
banging a pirate or two.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.528
Here's how to say, "Faster, harder."

05:20.611 --> 05:21.863
Because that'll come in handy.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.198
[ugly guttural sounds]

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
Now you try it.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.577
[all grunting]

05:27.660 --> 05:29.787
No, it's more like...

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
You know the sound you make
after letting out a fart

05:32.123 --> 05:33.541
you've been holding in all day?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.044
Oh, please.
You've never held in a fart in your life.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.336
Tough but fair.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
[Lana] Like now, Pam.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.966
Now would have been a great time
to hold it in.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.470
[Pam grunting in Dri'n]

05:45.553 --> 05:49.432
[Archer laughs]
I have-- I have no idea what she said

05:49.515 --> 05:51.934
-but it just sounds funny.
-[metal crashing]

05:52.018 --> 05:53.561
[Lana] Jesus, Cyril! Watch the landing.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.105
-You gotta slide it in there gently.
-[Pam in Dri'n]

05:56.814 --> 05:58.024
[muffled bang]

05:58.107 --> 05:59.859
You are a terrible pilot!

05:59.942 --> 06:02.111
[Cyril] You put me on a job
that's not my specialty.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.530
-That's bad captaining.
-Co-captaining.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.741
-Oh, now you share the credit?
-Fine.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.786
I should have assigned Cyril
to his specialty of, uh--

06:09.869 --> 06:12.455
What is your specialty again?
Space accounting?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.707
You're putting "space" in front of it
to make it extra silly,

06:14.791 --> 06:17.376
but it's actually really an important part
of running a ship.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.669
[doors open]

06:18.753 --> 06:21.255
[pirates grunting]

06:22.131 --> 06:23.132
That was quick.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.390
[speaking Dri'n]

06:31.474 --> 06:32.558
-He's asking--
-[gunfire]

06:34.644 --> 06:35.645
[bodies thud]

06:38.648 --> 06:42.360
[Pam sighs] He was just asking
where we got these human costumes, but--

06:43.069 --> 06:44.695
Oh, thank God you're here, Cyril.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.990
-You're so quick on the draw.
-My blaster got stuck in its holster!

06:48.074 --> 06:49.867
-I can help with that.
-Stop it!

06:49.951 --> 06:51.994
Unwanted advance in the workplace!

06:52.078 --> 06:54.247
Take it up with the Dri'n pirate HR.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.708
[Lana] Get those uniforms on
and put in your voice changers.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.918
More pirates <i>will</i> be coming.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.586
On my tits. Wha-a-at?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.796
Do you even have tits?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.297
They're retractable.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.052
[sighs] Now, where is that mainframe?

07:08.136 --> 07:11.055
-This ship has zero Feng Shui.
-[door opens]

07:11.139 --> 07:12.140
Whoa.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.810
There's gotta be a switch
to get a laser bridge or something.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.894
[clicks]

07:16.978 --> 07:20.815
Why people build dangerous ravines
in spaceships is beyond me!

07:20.898 --> 07:22.817
[screaming]

07:22.900 --> 07:24.819
-[thuds]
-[panting]

07:24.902 --> 07:26.946
You gotta warn me next time!

07:27.029 --> 07:29.657
We almost-- And that hook is not secure!

07:29.740 --> 07:31.742
How do you even know
the mainframe is on this side?

07:31.826 --> 07:34.912
Oh, I don't.
I just find terror kind of hot, you know?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.247
I do not know!

07:36.330 --> 07:39.125
Not to mention the woman
swinging the man across is totally...

07:39.208 --> 07:40.501
[screaming] ...emasculating!

07:40.585 --> 07:41.836
Shit balls!

07:44.338 --> 07:48.134
Guys, remember, place them on
the structural beams for maximum impact.

07:48.217 --> 07:51.137
I need more. I'm missing a testicle.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.056
-What the hell are you doing?
-What's the big deal? It's thermite.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.058
Throw it anywhere,
it's gonna blow up the ship.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.894
I'm not letting you waste thermite.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.479
Give me the thermite. [grunts]

08:00.062 --> 08:01.397
Goddamn it, Archer.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.651
[laughing] Uh-oh. It was an accident.
Yeah, it was flirty horseplay.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.196
-These aren't toys.
-Your boobs?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.406
-Because I beg to differ.
-[grunts] It's stuck.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.575
Krieger, how do you peel off
these thermite charges?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.327
-[Krieger] <i>Oh, no worries there.</i>
-Oh, good.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.330
[Krieger] <i>It's a super-polymer!</i>
<i>Can't be removed or disarmed.</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:20.458
I thought they would peel off
like air fresheners.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.294
They look like air fresheners.
Just take your shirt off then.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.796
I'm not wearing a shirt or bra under this.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.881
Oh, I noticed.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.132
We all noticed.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.342
Is it for the pirates?

08:29.425 --> 08:32.178
Because they do not make
good husbands, Lana.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.889
I am not trying to get a pirate husband!

08:34.972 --> 08:37.642
This ship has no AC,
and pirate garb isn't exactly--

08:37.725 --> 08:38.976
Oh, shit.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.144
[pirates in Dri'n]
What's all this?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.521
[Lana in Dri'n]
Just putting up these--

08:41.604 --> 08:42.897
air fresheners.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.106
[Archer in Dri'n]
Because the prisoners smell worse

08:44.190 --> 08:45.900
than a shithouse rat.

08:45.983 --> 08:50.029
-Hey!
-[pirates laughing]

08:51.239 --> 08:52.865
Huh, it actually worked.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.535
Almost like Krieger
knows what he was doing.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.579
I'm sorry, Lana.
He'll never be a space cowboy.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.541
-Now, let's blow up this ship--
-Without blowing my tits off.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
Give me one more.
I need to finish my testicle.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.628
-Here.
-Seriously?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.964
Guys, even for me
this is getting childish.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.342
[Malory] <i>Don't mention children.</i>
<i>Lana will smear her mascara.</i>

09:11.425 --> 09:14.637
Eavesdropping and lobbing insults
is not running comms.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.305
I knew I should have done the assigning,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.392
because everyone you picked
is spectacularly wrong for the job.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.769
[Cyril]
See, this is what I'm talking about.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.480
Why would they put the mainframe
right next door to the mess?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.482
[scoffs]
The heat would be hell on the data core!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.402
What, did you read that
in your spaceship architecture magazine?

09:29.485 --> 09:31.237
You mean <i>Starchitectural Digest</i>?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.155
Yes. Shall we get to work?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.492
Um...

09:37.243 --> 09:39.370
Do you know how to disable a radar system?

09:39.453 --> 09:40.454
[scoffs] No.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.082
Is this another "fear is hot" thing,
or do you really not know?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.542
Because I sure don't.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.002
Ugh, bad captaining!

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
[Archer laughs] <i>Mission accomplished.</i>

09:49.505 --> 09:51.090
How long should we set the timers for?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.843
[Lana] All right, let's see, uh,
Cyril and Cheryl have to disarm the radar,

09:53.926 --> 09:55.136
we all have to get to the hatch,

09:55.219 --> 09:57.763
and I have to strip this pirate suit off
so the bomb won't blow my tits off.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.889
And Archer's baby-maker!

09:58.973 --> 10:01.267
Don't-- Don't say "baby," Pam,
because you know--

10:01.350 --> 10:02.476
-[grunts]
-[bomb beeps]

10:02.560 --> 10:03.769
-[groans]
-[Pam] Shit!

10:03.853 --> 10:05.730
You set them off! How much time we got?

10:05.813 --> 10:06.981
Shit! Eleven minutes.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.941
Jesus! Couldn't you have kicked
a higher number?

10:09.025 --> 10:12.445
-[coughs] Or, you know, not at all?
-We gotta run.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.614
Yeah, not much of a runner.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.115
Okay, guys, listen up. We have 11 minutes

10:16.198 --> 10:18.409
<i>to get our asses off this ship</i>
<i>before it explodes.</i>

10:18.492 --> 10:19.785
Oh, God. [inhales shakily]

10:19.869 --> 10:22.622
If you find terror hot,
I must be gorgeous to you right now.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.875
-Yeah!
-No, stop! I shouldn't even be here!

10:25.958 --> 10:28.878
<i>I should have been the one kicking back</i>
<i>on the</i> Seamus <i>running comms!</i>

10:28.961 --> 10:31.672
For your information,
I've got my hands full.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.215
[Cyril] <i>Full of what, gin and tonics?</i>

10:33.299 --> 10:36.218
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-[Cyril] <i>We can hear the ice clinking.</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:38.638
-No, that's space static.
-[rapid clinking]

10:38.721 --> 10:40.056
Must be sun spots.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.224
We need you to connect us with Ray.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.476
He's on a sick day!

10:43.559 --> 10:45.770
[Cyril]
<i>We're going to blow up in 11 minutes!</i>

10:45.853 --> 10:47.438
-[Archer] <i>Closer to ten.</i>
-[sighs]

10:47.521 --> 10:48.898
Hold, please.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.232
-[button clicks]
-Ray?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.400
[peaceful music playing]

10:51.484 --> 10:53.194
[Cyril] <i>Ray! Thank God. We need your help.</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:56.739
-Yeah, kind of in the middle of something.
-[Malory] <i>Ray, our surgery pod</i>

10:56.822 --> 10:59.408
<i>is not designed for recreational use.</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:02.370
-This is a medical procedure.
-[Malory] <i>Scented candles?</i>

11:02.453 --> 11:05.539
Is it a crime to want to brighten up
my colonoscopy?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.501
-I think not.
-[Malory] <i>You said it wasn't recreational!</i>

11:08.584 --> 11:10.795
Colorectal cancer's serious business!

11:10.878 --> 11:13.047
You should be checked
every ten years after 50.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.590
Ugh, how old are you?

11:14.673 --> 11:18.386
[Ray] <i>Or if you have atypical symptoms,</i>
<i>like a change in bowel habits.</i>

11:18.469 --> 11:21.555
Speaking of which, we're in the bowels
of an enemy battle cruiser!

11:21.639 --> 11:25.726
I'll be wearing my colorectal blue ribbon
that says, "I got tested."

11:25.810 --> 11:28.437
Tomorrow, after my sick day,
which you're interrupting.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.523
[Cheryl] <i>Ugh, we need you</i>
<i>to walk us through disabling</i>

11:30.606 --> 11:33.150
<i>a giant spaceship radar system thingy.</i>

11:33.234 --> 11:35.569
But my crisis vest is on Deck 2!

11:37.738 --> 11:38.989
-[Cyril] <i>Ray!</i>
-Fine.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.660
Let old Ray just interrupt
his prescribed lifesaving medical test

11:42.743 --> 11:46.080
to call up alien battle cruiser schematics
on his sick day.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.041
Don't suppose you have
a ship model number?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.794
[Cyril] <i>We're inside the ship, so no.</i>
<i>And kinda in a hurry!</i>

11:51.877 --> 11:53.504
Do you see a blinking green light?

11:53.587 --> 11:55.923
[overlapping beeps]

11:56.006 --> 11:57.007
[Cyril] We're dead.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.094
[sighs] Don't you just crave
its sweet release?

12:00.177 --> 12:04.432
Okay, sending you
the disarming protocols... now.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.350
Thanks, Ray. You're a lifesaver, you're--

12:06.892 --> 12:08.477
Goddamn it, Ray!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.271
-Is this a picture of your colon?
-Aww.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.355
Sorry!

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
This wine might be mixing
with my propofol.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.777
-I do see why this is addictive.
-[Cyril] <i>We only have eight minutes!</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:18.946
Don't get your panties in a bunch!

12:19.029 --> 12:20.739
[typing]

12:20.823 --> 12:22.408
Also, do you see any polyps?

12:23.075 --> 12:26.328
Lana, how is it possible
you wanna give all this up for diapers?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.457
I don't know! Maybe because I don't need
to play two-bit space cowboy

12:29.540 --> 12:31.083
just because I'm scared of commitment.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.669
How dare you speak
precisely the truth at me.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.671
Hey, guys! Wait up!

12:35.754 --> 12:36.881
You used to be fun.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.842
Now you want to do not-fun stuff
like settling down.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.677
Well, I got news for you, sister.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.387
Don't say that, ever.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.931
Settling is for potato chips.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.016
Oh, God, Archer.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.518
Will you stop treating me
like some baby-crazy cliché

12:49.602 --> 12:51.187
of maternal desire? [gasps]

12:51.270 --> 12:52.938
[cats meowing]

12:54.690 --> 12:56.484
Aww, look at them!

12:56.567 --> 12:58.194
Oh, come on, Lana.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.738
[gasps] Space ocelots!

13:00.821 --> 13:02.573
Actually, they're called "grimalkians."

13:02.656 --> 13:04.033
Shut your mouth, Pam!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.702
That is a goddamn space ocelot!

13:08.787 --> 13:10.372
-Ow! Son of a bitch.
-[laughs]

13:10.456 --> 13:11.624
You're a real natural.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.917
I've seen these before.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.253
A shithead ex of mine had one as a pet.
I think they're endangered.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.340
No doubt the Dri'n stole them
to sell their fur to illegal traders.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.468
Yeah, this ex <i>was</i> an illegal trader,
so that all tracks.

13:22.551 --> 13:26.096
Shit, we've only got seven minutes
to get off this death star--

13:26.430 --> 13:28.098
lowercase "D," lowercase "S"--

13:28.182 --> 13:31.477
and back to the <i>Seamus</i>
before we explode in a million pieces!

13:31.560 --> 13:34.396
No! We can't blow up the ship
with them onboard. They'll go extinct!

13:34.480 --> 13:37.107
I'll watch anything
that asshole loved burn.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.193
[baby talk]
Just look how adorable they are.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.402
-[crunches]
-Ow!

13:40.486 --> 13:41.487
[Archer laughs]

13:41.570 --> 13:44.615
Guys, look at this! They love me!

13:44.698 --> 13:46.200
It's like I'm their king!

13:46.283 --> 13:47.368
[siren blaring]

13:47.451 --> 13:49.537
[pirates grunting]

13:49.620 --> 13:50.621
[Lana] Uh, Cyril?

13:50.704 --> 13:51.914
Cheryl? Did you guys--

13:51.997 --> 13:54.917
...fail spectacularly
at the one task you were given?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.546
[Cyril] <i>You said turn off the radar.</i>
<i>You didn't say anything about an alarm!</i>

13:58.629 --> 14:00.714
It was clearly implied!

14:00.798 --> 14:03.717
[baby talk]
Yes, it was, wasn't it? Yes, it was.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.930
[alarm blaring]

14:08.013 --> 14:09.348
[pirates speaking Dri'n]

14:10.099 --> 14:13.310
[Cyril] All clear. No intruders in here.
Oh, shit, is that English?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.271
[Cheryl]
He's the intruder you're looking for!

14:15.354 --> 14:16.897
Aw, balls! Mine's broken too!

14:16.981 --> 14:18.857
-[pirates grunting]
-[gunfire]

14:19.441 --> 14:20.734
[Cyril] Hey, screw you for that.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.528
[Cheryl] Girl's gotta self-preserve, dude.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.740
[Lana] Okay, so now we need
to rescue Cyril and Cheryl--

14:26.824 --> 14:29.535
Yeah, that's great,
but we have another rescue first.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.120
-What?
-The space ocelots, Pam!

14:31.203 --> 14:33.414
We've got... six minutes,

14:33.497 --> 14:34.665
so let's start with the...

14:34.748 --> 14:37.167
[baby talk] ...widdle baby furballs!

14:37.251 --> 14:38.377
-[crunches]
-Oh, motherf--

14:38.460 --> 14:40.296
...is <i>not</i> what you should be,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.840
because these things do not like you.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.800
It is a hilarious twist of fate.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.553
-[grimalkians meowing]
-Holy hell!

14:47.636 --> 14:49.471
Those little twerps are quick!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.557
-Oh, well. Let's get out of here.
-What the--

14:52.141 --> 14:53.142
[meows]

14:53.225 --> 14:54.393
Aww, he likes you.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.978
Um, no, Lana.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.730
He <i>loves</i> me.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.273
This guy is so cool.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.983
Here, Lana, get a picture.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.402
Just kick the little shit off
and let's roll!

15:03.485 --> 15:04.570
We're buds!

15:04.653 --> 15:07.823
I'm a badass space cowboy,
and he's my deputy!

15:07.907 --> 15:11.452
[baby talk] Don't you wanna jump
on my shoulder and be my widdle deputy?

15:11.535 --> 15:13.621
I'm a co-space cowboy.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.540
Wow. Jealousy is an ugly color
on you, Lana.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.919
Something's wrong with this blaster!

15:20.002 --> 15:22.796
-[pirate grunts]
-Have you tried opening your eyes?

15:22.880 --> 15:23.881
[pirate grunts]

15:23.964 --> 15:26.634
Yes! They actually are open! For real!

15:28.636 --> 15:30.179
[both grunt]

15:30.262 --> 15:32.264
Guess that's not a factor anyway.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.018
-[pirate speaking Dri'n]
-[Archer] Where's the fire, brother?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.771
Oh, shit. Was that English?

15:38.854 --> 15:40.105
-[gunfire]
-[grunts]

15:40.189 --> 15:42.232
Why'd you even open your big mouth,
Archer?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.484
He was running right by us!

15:43.567 --> 15:47.237
I think the better question is,
why do we even have a ship robot

15:47.321 --> 15:50.616
if he can't even make
his stupid robot gadgets work?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.078
-We're cut off!
-My circulation is cut off.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.746
The grip on this thing is unreal.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.290
Look at this! He's eating this shit up.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.668
[both grunt]

16:00.751 --> 16:01.752
Come on, little buddy.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.755
-Let's go in the fun tunnel.
-[grimalkian meows]

16:05.714 --> 16:06.757
-Pam?
-[Pam] Nah.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.218
I don't do tight spaces
I'm not familiar with.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.137
Just go, I'll hold them off
and meet you at the dock.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.348
Come and get it, space dicks!

16:15.307 --> 16:18.352
-Well, at least it's downhill.
-A little too downhill.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.355
-Are you sure this is an air vent?
-Of course it's an air vent!

16:21.438 --> 16:24.441
[both screaming]

16:24.525 --> 16:27.361
-[pipe rattling]
-[bodies thud]

16:28.028 --> 16:30.030
Ugh, you've gotta be shitting me.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.911
Oops. I guess it wasn't an air vent.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.996
[grimalkian meows]

16:37.079 --> 16:38.914
-[gunfire]
-[pirates grunting]

16:38.998 --> 16:40.624
Ah! My blaster jammed!

16:40.708 --> 16:42.960
Blasters don't jam, you lying fleshbag!

16:43.043 --> 16:44.586
You're pathetic! Cover me!

16:48.757 --> 16:51.593
-I thought you had a plan!
-I do! I'm making a necklace.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.680
I will give you one of my teeth.
Just get me off this ship!

16:54.763 --> 16:56.932
No, it's not the same.
It has to be from a kill.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.768
[gasps] Unless that's something
you might be interested in.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.103
Ew, no.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.522
Hey, any chance of getting a rescue here?

17:03.605 --> 17:05.357
[Lana] <i>Yeah... Uh, about that.</i>

17:05.441 --> 17:06.734
Oh, Lana. Thank God.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.318
Archer had us escape
in a stupid air vent that--

17:08.402 --> 17:09.820
Air vent, copy that.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.740
-[pipe rattling]
-[bodies thud]

17:12.823 --> 17:14.324
Cyril, let her finish!

17:14.408 --> 17:17.703
Oh, God, this is a dead end.
We have two minutes! What do we do?

17:17.786 --> 17:21.415
Ugh, you're not gonna wet your uniform
like last time? Not the time or place.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.333
Actually, this is a pretty good time
and place.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.919
New plan. We form a human-ocelot ladder...

17:26.003 --> 17:27.588
Ugh, I'd rather just die.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.006
...to get back to the air vent.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.841
Stop calling it an air vent!

17:30.924 --> 17:31.925
-Fine!
-[gunfire]

17:32.009 --> 17:33.927
-[Pam screaming]
-[Cyril] Pam!

17:34.011 --> 17:36.096
-Thank God!
-You're running the wrong way!

[Pam] Cannonball!

17:37.931 --> 17:38.932
[all groan]

17:39.016 --> 17:40.893
[Cyril groans] It's in my mouth!

17:40.976 --> 17:42.478
[pirates grunting]

17:47.941 --> 17:49.651
-This is not good.
-[grimalkian yelps]

17:52.905 --> 17:54.573
Even my little ocelot bud bailed.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.159
-I'm calling Krieger for backup.
-No, Lana!

17:57.242 --> 17:59.369
Space cowboys do or die.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.496
He's our only option.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.914
Malory, Krieger.

18:01.997 --> 18:02.998
<i>Come in!</i>

18:03.082 --> 18:05.125

<i>-Come in!</i>

18:05.209 --> 18:07.127
Yes! It's Krieger!
What do you need? I can do it!

<i>We need backup immediately.</i>

-I'm on it!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.383
Yes! Needed by real humans.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.430
[groans]

18:18.514 --> 18:20.307
My God, why did we even bring him?

18:20.390 --> 18:23.102
[shouts] This is it, people!
This is the end!

18:23.519 --> 18:26.814
Brace yourselves for obliteration!

18:26.897 --> 18:29.525
[screaming]

18:29.608 --> 18:32.778
-I really like her this way.
-I'm kind of into it myself.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.862
Wait! Look!

18:35.864 --> 18:37.950

18:42.496 --> 18:45.249
[Archer]
Jesus! They're demons in disguise!

18:45.916 --> 18:47.417
I feel fooled!

18:47.501 --> 18:50.838
-[beams blasting]
-[pirates groaning]

18:50.921 --> 18:52.339
-[Pam] Ugh!
-[Cyril] Oh, my God!

18:52.422 --> 18:54.258
Why does it have to be so gross?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.927
-[pipe rattling]
-[thuds]

18:57.010 --> 18:58.137
Stand back, folks.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.805
I've "bot" this!

18:59.888 --> 19:01.682
-[all groan]
-[Archer] And once again,

19:01.765 --> 19:04.768
you and your iron heart
are completely useless.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.354
[grunts]

19:07.437 --> 19:10.482
-[grimalkian meows]
-[Archer] There's my pal! Back to normal.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.943
-You can't quit me, can you?
-[grimalkian purrs]

19:13.026 --> 19:14.111
How much time?

19:14.194 --> 19:16.321
-Thirty seconds.
-[Archer] This is gonna be tight.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.241
[Lana] It wouldn't be tight
if you hadn't screwed up the assignments!

19:19.324 --> 19:22.578
Whatever, Lana. Maybe I screwed up
the assignments on purpose

19:22.661 --> 19:24.955
so you'd feel needed and want to stay!

19:25.038 --> 19:26.665
Oh, please. Maybe you're just saying that

19:26.748 --> 19:28.750
as a cool way to cover
screwing up the assignments!

19:28.834 --> 19:32.087
-Oh, go have an Earth baby, why don't you?
-[grimalkians meowing]

19:32.171 --> 19:34.214
But we can't just leave
these space ocelots here.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.883
Grimalkians. And, yes, we can.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.802
Pam, I'm not gonna do this with you!
I'm already too upset.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.888
[Lana] Oh, God, their eyes.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.472
-Even though they hate you?
-Yep.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.724
-Even though.
-Fifteen seconds!

19:43.807 --> 19:46.768
I think these furry banshees
are just gonna have to stay on board.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.063
[grimalkians whining]

19:51.940 --> 19:55.652
[explosions]

20:00.365 --> 20:02.117
[grimalkians meowing]

20:02.201 --> 20:04.870
I meant on board the other ship.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.788
Ugh! Goddamn it to shit!

20:06.872 --> 20:08.707
Can't these bastards
stay in the cargo hold?

20:08.790 --> 20:10.918
[gasps] Mommy's just joking.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.713
[whispering] I think we all know
who the fun parent is.
