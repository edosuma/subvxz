(READING)

00:27.528 --> 00:29.612
Ah, the Xmas season.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.698
Who wants a delicious
unshelled nut?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.908
Ooh, I'll have one.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.249
It's "nut" so good.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.792
(GROANS)

00:43.001 --> 00:46.629
What's wrong, Fry?
Are you regretting
another wasted year?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.173
I don't know.
Something about Xmas

00:49.258 --> 00:50.842
just doesn't feel
like Christmas.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.385
(ALARM BLARING)

00:52.636 --> 00:55.763
Santa's coming!
Initiate defenses!

01:05.274 --> 01:08.234
God rest
ye merry gentlemen

01:08.360 --> 01:10.069
in peace.

01:14.158 --> 01:18.327
Can someone please explain
how you celebrate
this crazy holiday?

01:18.579 --> 01:19.829
Preferably in song.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.959
It's the violentest
season of the year

01:25.669 --> 01:28.921
When Kringle-bot
come dispensing
mugs of Xmas fear

01:29.673 --> 01:32.216
Sugar plummy
visions will be dancing
in your head

01:32.301 --> 01:35.261
When I cane you
from the comfort of my sled

01:36.263 --> 01:38.931
On Xmas Eve,
we don our gay apparel

01:39.850 --> 01:42.977
Kevlar vests,
asbestos stockings
and a barrel

01:43.061 --> 01:46.439
And if
Grandma's Xmas fruitcake
finally reaches critical mass

01:46.523 --> 01:49.108
It can be re-gifted
straight to Santa's ass

01:51.695 --> 01:55.156
But the ornamental armaments
are merely superficial

01:55.365 --> 01:58.618
The tinsel and the trappings
are just icing on the missile

01:59.036 --> 02:03.206
The one thing that you need
to make your Xmas
Day splendiferous

02:03.290 --> 02:07.251
Is a pine tree
A pine tree that's coniferous

02:07.961 --> 02:11.130
We have to have a pine tree
that's coniferous

02:12.216 --> 02:13.549
You're welcome.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.221
You know, Santa may
have killed Scruffy,
but he makes a good point.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.973
What we need is an
old-fashioned pine tree.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.266
Cram it, Virginia.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.853
Pine trees have been
extinct for over 800 years.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.980
Professor,
maybe there's some way

02:28.065 --> 02:30.024
to bring the pine
trees back to life.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.984
Like we did with
the barking snakes.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.402
(BARKING)

02:33.904 --> 02:35.822
Pine trees aren't
barking snakes.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.783
They won't just
turn up in a salad
at Olive Garden.

02:38.867 --> 02:43.204
But there is one
hope and, as usual,
it's Norwegian.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.339
(CREW SCREAMING)

02:57.344 --> 02:58.344
Behold!

02:58.595 --> 03:01.722
The Svalbard
Global Seed Vault.

03:01.849 --> 03:07.019
Since 2008,
the vault has preserved seeds
of every known plant species,

03:07.104 --> 03:08.729
in case of extinction.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.565
And I brought
a few seeds of my own.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.567
(BARKING)

03:12.943 --> 03:16.195
Halt! What's your
business pokey-poking
about the seed vault?

03:16.280 --> 03:19.240
Guardian of mankind's
precious botanical
heritage there?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.201
We just want to come in
and rummage about a bit.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.954
Oh, so... Okay.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.457
Yo, ABBA,
what's that next door?

03:29.585 --> 03:32.044
That's the Germ
Warfare Repository.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.296
It's so close.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.549
Is there any chance
of cross-contamination?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.259
No.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.762
Now, your pine trees
were all chopped down

03:41.847 --> 03:44.891
to make emergency toilet paper
during the Fifty-Year Squirts.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.310
Lucky the seeds have
been preserved here
in the vault there.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.228
What's that splork on them?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.647
It's not germs, is it?

03:51.732 --> 03:52.732
No.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.580
Now that's a tree
worth chopping down.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.333
Indeed,
'tis a lovely tree.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.878
'Twill truly be my
finest Xmas ever.

Could the seed
have been contaminated

04:52.501 --> 04:54.752
by a virus from
the germ vault?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.379
Yeah, I suppose.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.799
Wait.
This could be a good thing.
That weaponized virus

04:59.883 --> 05:02.635
made the sickly, little tree
grow big and strong.

to its primeval state.

before the white man came.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.771
(DEVICE POWERING UP)
Good news.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.691
All these pine trees are
fighting global warming

05:58.775 --> 06:00.192
by producing oxygen.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.360
Happy now, Gore?

06:01.445 --> 06:02.486
Yeah.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.364
But I'd be happier if
I had a set of lungs.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.952
Wait a second.
Oxygen levels are
rising too rapidly.

06:10.162 --> 06:14.540

06:14.666 --> 06:16.292
As long as it
doesn't hit 70.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.127

06:52.204 --> 06:54.914
Okay, crew.
Xmas break is over.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.167
It's time to
destroy these gifts
we forgot to deliver.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:59.795 --> 07:02.254
How come we get
off for every dumb
human holiday,

07:02.339 --> 07:04.423
but not for
robot holidays?

07:04.508 --> 07:06.467
Oh, Lord.
Not Robanukah.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.469
I'm talking about Robanukah,

07:08.553 --> 07:11.806
the holiest six
and a half weeks
in the robot calendar.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.352
That's just a fake holiday
you make up every year
to get out of work.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.978
Yeah. If it's real,

07:18.063 --> 07:20.856
how come there's no song
that explains how
to celebrate it?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.441
Because there is.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.568
Hit it.
Hit what?

07:24.736 --> 07:26.862
I placed instruments
under your seats.

or I'll break them
over your heads.

(SINGING)
Robanukah may sound
as if it's Jewish

07:34.121 --> 07:37.832
But its
ancient-sounding customs
are exceptionally newish

07:38.041 --> 07:41.001
So take a hearty swallow
from your robo-Kiddush cup

07:45.215 --> 07:47.716
Do you spin
a dreidel made from clay?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.554
Mine is called a droid-el
and it's rigged
to make you pay

07:53.682 --> 07:56.350
Do you eat these yummy,
tin-wrapped
chocolate coins?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.979
Better. We got fem-bots
with illegal five-speed groins

08:00.063 --> 08:02.898
Shalom, Ruth and Esther.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.401
Why with the music
so loud?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.821
Would it kill him
to turn up the heat
a little in here?

08:09.406 --> 08:12.324
By far, the most
important thing is oil

08:12.576 --> 08:15.870
To keep the lamp light burning
or to help the latkes broil

08:15.954 --> 08:19.832
No, we pour the holy lubricant
out from this sacred vessel

08:19.916 --> 08:22.918
into this blessed
pit so they can wrestle

08:23.253 --> 08:26.630
The extra made-up touch
that makes Robanukah so special

08:26.715 --> 08:30.176
is the oil in which the
nasty fem-bots wrestle

08:30.343 --> 08:33.429
We shall now begin the
traditional oil wrestling.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.308
Will the referee bring out
the ceremonial cruse
of petroleum oil?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.020
Thank you, Abraham.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.273
Not in the hair, please.
I just had it did.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.111
Oh, no.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.780
These broads are
supposed to wrestle for
six and a half weeks,

08:51.865 --> 08:55.034
but there's only
enough petroleum oil
for four and a half weeks.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.078
We're still
getting paid, right?

08:58.163 --> 09:00.623
I told you it's an audition!

09:00.707 --> 09:04.084
Bender, four and a half weeks
of oil wrestling
sounds like plenty.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.921
This isn't
a lousy reform Robanukah.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.923
We need more petroleum oil!

some squirrel oil.

It has to be petroleum oil!

about the hallowed
traditions of Robanukah?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.522
I reckon I do not.

of petroleum oil.

Can you make change
for a Nobel Prize?

09:45.126 --> 09:48.379

more petroleum oil?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.256
I'm afraid not, son.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.883
Petroleum only forms
when organic matter

09:52.968 --> 09:57.972
is subjected to intense
pressure for hundreds
of millions of years.

to look these poor

10:10.819 --> 10:13.529
and tell them their
oil-wrestling days are over.

10:21.913 --> 10:26.041
I suppose there could
be a minute quantity
of petroleum left,

10:26.167 --> 10:28.460
but it would be insanely
deep within the Earth

dangerously high...

It's an albino humping worm.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.384
Why do they call it that?

Because it doesn't
have any pigment.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.771
Forty kilometers, 50.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.523

down here somewhere.

Go deeper. Deeper!

No, Bender.
The ship can't withstand
this much pressure.

Sometimes it falls
apart just sitting
in the hangar.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.534

I've never asked for
anything before,

11:42.869 --> 11:44.703
but seeing those
fem-bots glistening

11:44.788 --> 11:47.289
with oil means more
to me than life itself.

Call me an old fool,
but I believe the Lord is
speaking through you.

LaBarbara, Hermes,
happy Kwanzaa.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.077
We brought a chocolate cake,

13:49.162 --> 13:51.747
but now I'm worried that
might be offensive
in some way.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.332
Just sit down.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.835
Happy Kwanzaa,
brother men and sister men.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.671
Well, look at the cat
the cat dragged in.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.466
Kwanzaa tradition
encourages educational gifts.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.093
So I brought Dwight
my book on mathketball.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.096
Whoa!
Let me see that.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.183
I'll sign it for you later.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.602
Man,
it's a cold one out there.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.020
Barbados Slim?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.688
Come in, Barbados.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.943
Look at yourself,
all throbbing and shirtless
for the holiday.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.819
I hope you're
ready to celebrate.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.156
All night long, woman.
(CHUCKLES)

14:27.534 --> 14:30.202
I'm glad you all could be
here with my family.

14:30.286 --> 14:34.957
Kwanzaa traditions
are quite ancient,
dating back over 1,000 years.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.375
Whoa!

14:36.459 --> 14:40.796
If only someone
could tell us more
about these traditions.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.382
Oh, yeah.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.883
Hey, Kool-Aid's here.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.844
No, child. That's not
a made-up character.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.137
It's Kwanzaa-bot.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.932
And I'm gonna tell you all
how we celebrate Kwanzaa.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.976
Zoidberg, lay down a beat.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.395
How about I just lay down?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.105
(TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING)

14:59.983 --> 15:03.318
(SINGING)
There's seven basic principles
that go to make up Kwanzaa

15:03.403 --> 15:06.947
So sit your
asses down and have
some knowledge dropped upon ya

15:07.031 --> 15:08.657
Kujichagulia

15:08.741 --> 15:10.242
And Umoja.
And the rest!

15:10.326 --> 15:11.285
Now we get it

15:11.369 --> 15:13.662
Sit back down
There's gonna be a test

15:13.830 --> 15:15.497
My favorite's Ujamaa

15:15.582 --> 15:17.207
Cooperative economics

15:17.292 --> 15:19.668
Yo, bulldog, I'm talking here
Put away the comics

15:21.045 --> 15:24.089
Ku'umba is another one
It stands for creativity

15:24.173 --> 15:27.801
Like the ever-changing nature
of my sexual proclivities

15:28.011 --> 15:31.054
I think there's one called Nia
but I don't speak Swahili

15:31.431 --> 15:34.558
Something about a pine tree
and an oil-wrestling deal-y?

15:34.642 --> 15:38.186
That's from Xmas and Robanukah
you plagiarizing lout

15:38.271 --> 15:41.607
Yeah, I'm kind of
losing interest here
I best be rolling out

15:41.691 --> 15:45.027
But before I go,
the most important thing

15:45.403 --> 15:46.820
What's that, black Santa?

15:46.904 --> 15:50.324
You need seven Kwanzaa candles
that you light up every night

15:50.450 --> 15:52.075
But they best be
made of beeswax

15:52.201 --> 15:53.869
or you all might
as well be white

15:54.245 --> 15:58.373
They must be made of beeswax
or we might as well be white

15:59.375 --> 16:01.460
Well, we got
no beeswax candles,

16:01.544 --> 16:05.213
but these scented
regular wax candles
will do just fine.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.592
Girl, those stink sticks
are for single women
who take baths.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.428
If your Kwanzaa candles
ain't 100% beeswax,

16:11.554 --> 16:13.263
you bring shame
on your people.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.931
Well, now that won't do.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.892
Husband,
show a little Ku'umba

16:16.976 --> 16:19.436
and fetch some beeswax
before Kwanzaa ends.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.938
Sweet candelabra of
La Habra, LaBarbara.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.899
Isn't this the last night
of Kwanzaa?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.651
Who the hell knows?

16:27.362 --> 16:30.572
Finally, a bee farm that's
open late on Kwanzaa.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.824
Madam, I need beeswax.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.202
You sure you don't need
a little honey, handsome?

16:35.286 --> 16:38.538
Maybe a taste of sweet nectar
straight from the hive?

16:38.623 --> 16:39.748
(ALL EXCLAIM IN DISGUST)

16:39.832 --> 16:43.085
I just need some beeswax
to make Kwanzaa candles.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.670
Well, that's too darn bad.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.339
There ain't no beeswax
in the whole world.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.676
Oh, no. This could be
the year without a Kwanzaa,

16:50.760 --> 16:53.428
like every year before 1966.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.305
The bees are
acting all crazy

16:55.390 --> 16:58.058
like they been drinking
Tang and cough syrup,

16:58.142 --> 17:01.186
or as I call it,
my Friday night.
(LAUGHS)

17:01.270 --> 17:02.646
(COUGHING)

17:03.356 --> 17:04.522
My God.

17:04.773 --> 17:09.027
It's Colony Collapse Syndrome.
The bees are swarming
with parasites.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.319
They're all dying.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.321
Yeah,
but what a way to go.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.534
"Die young,
leave a pretty corpse,"
that's what I say.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.327
You should say
something else.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.788
Wait. I know where
we can get beeswax.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.957
From those giant space bees
who nearly killed us,

17:22.040 --> 17:23.875
and we swore we'd
never go back there.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.752
Let's go back there.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.925
To communicate
with the bees,

17:32.009 --> 17:34.636
we'll need to use
these trans-bumbleators.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.847
Bender,
say something in bee talk.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.474
(BUZZING)

17:39.976 --> 17:43.019
I'm sorry, Bender.
What do you want me
to put on the glass?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.146
(BUZZING)

17:44.397 --> 17:46.481
Okay, if we survive.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.868
Something's wrong.
It's way too quiet.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.828
Like the deadly Prius.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.123
FARNSWORTH: Ah,
here they come.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.459
They're in attack formation.
They're gonna kill us.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.548
That was weird.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.634
It's like the
Jägermeister air show
all over again.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.141
According to Google Hive,

18:21.225 --> 18:23.602
we are at the exact center
of the honeycomb.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.480
And there's a Jamba
Juice 0.2 miles
that way.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.857
Does that thing tell you
where the queen bee is?

18:28.941 --> 18:33.236
The big, fat, ugly,
compound-eyed,
hairy-thoraxed...

18:33.321 --> 18:35.572
Don't be applying
your Eurocentric

18:35.656 --> 18:37.866
standards of
beauty to me, fool.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.620
What's with the
kamikaz-bees?

18:41.704 --> 18:43.955
Man, my hive's
been going buck-wild

18:44.040 --> 18:47.542
since these blood-ganking
butt crabs moved in.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.171
Been there, done that.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.216
They're all infected,
just like the bees on Earth.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.719
Brother-sucking parasites gone
and disrupted our hive mind.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.638
Now, instead of
working in harmony,

18:59.722 --> 19:02.140
my bees just talk
smack to each other.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.351
Are you all black
with yellow stripes

19:04.477 --> 19:06.603
or are you yellow
with black stripes?

19:06.729 --> 19:09.356
Yellow with
black stripes, man.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.567
Why don't you just move along?

19:12.735 --> 19:14.986
Let me ask you something,
you sting my wife?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.655
What kind of
buzzing question is that?

19:16.739 --> 19:19.991
Where do you get
the wings big enough
to ask me that?

19:23.704 --> 19:27.499
Okay, gang.
We have plenty of beeswax.
Let's get back to the ship.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.709
No, we are not
going anywhere.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.379
I can't abide all
this bee-on-bee conflict.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.465
It's time to
African-Americanize
these honeybees.

19:37.134 --> 19:41.388
Listen up, bees.
It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.098
It means "unity".

19:45.268 --> 19:47.978
You have to learn to
work together again.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.522
The crazy
tablecloth man is right.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.108
It's time to set
aside our differences.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.069
Black stripe, yellow stripe.

19:56.237 --> 20:00.031
At the end of the day,
we're just a couple
of darn talking space bees.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.242
Hey, forget about it.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.910
Come here
and give me a sting.

20:05.246 --> 20:09.207
Look. The spirit of Kwanzaa
is killing the parasites.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.333
(ALL CHEERING)

20:10.418 --> 20:11.418
FRY: Yuck!

20:11.502 --> 20:12.961
But, yay!

20:13.045 --> 20:14.796
Thank you, my human brother.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.966
Your message of unity
has touched our souls.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.928
We are once again of
a single hive mind.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.934
(CRASHING)
KWANZAA-BOT: Oh, yeah.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.519
Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's
here to save...

20:29.604 --> 20:30.562
(SQUELCHING)

20:30.646 --> 20:32.188
They killed him.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.946
Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.329
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

20:47.413 --> 20:48.496
(CHUCKLING)

20:48.581 --> 20:51.958
Don't worry.
The Futurama crew
will be back next year

20:52.043 --> 20:56.379
with all new
episodes featuring Bender,
Leela and me, Al Gore,

20:56.464 --> 20:58.381
as Captain Lance Starman.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.968
And from all of us here
at Gunderson's Nuts,
happy holidays.
