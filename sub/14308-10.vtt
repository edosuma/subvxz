WEBVTT

00:14.867 --> 00:17.500
- INCREASING THE BLOOD FLOW
TO MY BRAIN.

00:17.533 --> 00:21.533
- I CAN SEE UP YOUR NOSE.
IT'S NOT PLEASANT.

00:21.567 --> 00:24.300
- I HAVE TO WRITE AN ESSAY
FOR A SCHOOL I'M APPLYING TO,

00:24.333 --> 00:25.800
AND IT HAS TO BE PERFECT.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.667
- A HEADACHE.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.433
- WHY ARE YOU SO HUNG UP

00:30.467 --> 00:32.633
ON GETTING INTO
SOME PRIVATE SCHOOL ANYWAY?

00:32.667 --> 00:34.733
- IT'S NOT
SOME PRIVATE SCHOOL.

00:34.767 --> 00:38.767
IT'S PENNINGTON ACADEMY,
THE TOP SCHOOL IN NEW ORLEANS.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.433
THEIR CREATIVE WRITING
DEPARTMENT

00:40.467 --> 00:42.300
IS THE BEST
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.433
REALLY?

00:43.467 --> 00:45.733
YAWN.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.633
- THEY ALSO SERVE TATER TOTS
EVERY MONDAY.

00:48.667 --> 00:51.633
- I'M LISTENING.

00:53.433 --> 00:54.667
- IT'S NOT.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.867
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE

00:55.900 --> 00:57.500
THAT'S GOING TO SET ME APART.

00:57.533 --> 00:58.767
- OH, SWEETIE.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.333
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT THIS,

01:00.367 --> 01:01.500
BUT THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO

01:01.533 --> 01:02.867
IS PUT PRESSURE ON YOURSELF.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.833
SO JUST WRITE SOMETHING,

01:04.867 --> 01:06.433
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TURN IN
THE ESSAY BY THE END OF THE DAY,

01:06.467 --> 01:07.500
WHICH, BY MY WATCH,
IS IN THREE HOURS.

01:07.533 --> 01:10.367
WE CANNOT MISS THIS DEADLINE!

01:10.400 --> 01:13.567
AGAIN, NO PRESSURE.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.167
JUST WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING

01:16.200 --> 01:19.167
IN YOUR LIFE THAT'S...
AWESOME.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.833
- I ONCE ATE A SCAB
OFF MY KNEE.

01:21.867 --> 01:25.633
- NO, SOMETHING AWESOMER.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.800
- I ONCE ATE TWO SCABS
OFF MY KNEE.

01:28.833 --> 01:32.267
- NOTHING ABOUT EATING SCABS!

01:32.300 --> 01:36.300
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.133
- LOUIE, THAT'S IT!

01:38.167 --> 01:39.733
I SHOULD DO MY ESSAY ON YOU.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.700
BRILLIANT.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.733
- NICE.
LOOKS LIKE LOUIE THE GHOST

01:43.767 --> 01:45.267
IS FINALLY GETTING SOME LOVE.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.100
NO THANKS TO BUTTERFINGERS
OVER HERE.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.767
HEY, I WAS JOKING!

01:49.800 --> 01:51.700
COME BACK.

01:51.733 --> 01:54.667
HE CAN'T GET FAR.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.933
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:00.967 --> 02:03.367
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:03.400 --> 02:05.933
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:05.967 --> 02:09.600
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:09.633 --> 02:11.800
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:11.833 --> 02:13.467
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:13.500 --> 02:16.300
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:16.333 --> 02:19.133
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:19.167 --> 02:20.800
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:20.833 --> 02:24.867
*

02:24.900 --> 02:26.633
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:26.667 --> 02:29.200
*

02:36.300 --> 02:38.133
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:38.167 --> 02:39.333
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:42.433 --> 02:45.500
- TAYLOR, PLEASE,
NO SCREAMING.

02:45.533 --> 02:49.167
I GOT A GHOST COLD
AND A WICKED HEADACHE.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.133
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHY YOU GOT SICK, DAD.

02:51.167 --> 02:52.267
IT'S STRESS.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.333
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

02:53.367 --> 02:55.133
HOW MANY MORE FLYERS

02:55.167 --> 02:57.767
DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU BEFORE
YOU ATTEND MY FREE YOGA SEMINAR?

02:57.800 --> 03:01.867
- SIX MILLION.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.567
- GOOD NEWS.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.867
SO EVERY MONTH, MY SCHOOL
PUTS OUT A NEWSPAPER--

03:05.900 --> 03:06.867
- THAT'S AWESOME.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.233
NICE TO HEAR JOURNALISM

03:08.267 --> 03:09.667
IS ALIVE AND WELL
IN THIS COUNTRY.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.333
- THAT'S NOT
THE GOOD NEWS, MILES.

03:12.367 --> 03:14.567
THEY WANNA DO
A FEATURE ARTICLE ON ME

03:14.600 --> 03:16.700
SINCE I'M THE NEW GYMNASTICS
TEAM CAPTAIN.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.267
MY PICTURE'S GONNA BE
ON EVERY PAPER IN SCHOOL.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.633
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

03:20.667 --> 03:23.500
- YOU'LL BE
AN INSPIRATION TO OTHERS.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.533
- NO, THAT I HAVE
TO WEAR SOMETHING CUTE.

03:26.567 --> 03:27.800
- NO WAY.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.767
NO WAY.
NO WAY!

03:33.467 --> 03:35.433
FRANKIE!

03:35.467 --> 03:36.433
- COME ON, DAD.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.600
DOESN'T LOOKING AT THIS

03:37.633 --> 03:40.833
IMMEDIATELY RELAX YOU?

03:40.867 --> 03:42.633
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.333
- FRANKIE.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.433
GET IN HERE!

03:48.500 --> 03:50.167
- PENNINGTON ACADEMY

03:50.200 --> 03:52.633
REVIEWED YOUR APPLICATION
AND THEY LOVED IT!

03:52.667 --> 03:53.800
ESPECIALLY THE ESSAY.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.700
- NO WAY!
REALLY?

03:55.733 --> 03:57.533
- MM-HMM.
- CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED.

03:57.567 --> 04:01.633
FRANKIE HAD SOME PRETTY CHOICE
MATERIAL TO WRITE ABOUT.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.633
ELITE SCHOOLS?

04:05.667 --> 04:09.533
OOH, MY REFLECTION JOURNAL
IS GONNA BE FILLED UP TONIGHT.

04:09.567 --> 04:11.200
- WE CAN'T CELEBRATE YET.

04:11.233 --> 04:12.567
THE DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS
IS COMING

04:12.600 --> 04:13.767
THIS AFTERNOON
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.900
WE ALL NEED TO BE READY.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.367
THAT MEANS NO GHOSTING.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.500
- BELIEVE ME,
WITH THIS COLD,

04:18.533 --> 04:21.667
GHOSTING IS THE LAST THING
I WANNA DO.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.400
- I NEVER KNEW GHOSTS
COULD CATCH COLDS.

04:23.433 --> 04:26.167
- YEP.
THEY'RE JUST LIKE REGULAR COLDS.

04:31.467 --> 04:35.467
- YEAH, TOTALLY THE SAME.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.633
- TAYLOR,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

04:40.667 --> 04:42.600
- SURE.
- GOOD.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.133
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
I CAN COME TO YOU

04:44.167 --> 04:47.133
IF I EVER HAVE A QUESTION.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.700
OOH, THOUGHT OF ONE.

04:48.733 --> 04:51.100
WHEN'S YOUR INTERVIEW?
- AFTER SCHOOL.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.667
I'M MEETING THE REPORTER
AT THE BAKERY.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.500
- HEY, TAY!

04:57.100 --> 04:59.200
- OH, IT'S JUST A BEE.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.433
- THE EXTRA HONEY PACKET
I TOOK AT LUNCH.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.467
THEY FOUND ME!

05:14.500 --> 05:16.900
- MILES,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:16.933 --> 05:20.200
- I HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM
AND I REALLY NEED YOUR ADVICE.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.567
- SO I'M BUILDING
A MODEL RACE CAR

05:23.600 --> 05:25.133
WITH MY FRIEND, SCOOTER,
FROM GHOST SCOUTS.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.600
HE WANTS TO GO
WITH RACING STRIPES,

05:26.633 --> 05:28.133
BUT I WANNA GO
WITH COOL FLAMES.

05:28.167 --> 05:30.867
BIG PICKLE, RIGHT?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.467
- YOU CAME TO MY SCHOOL...

05:33.500 --> 05:35.400
AND SCARED OFF MY FRIEND

05:35.433 --> 05:37.867
TO TALK ABOUT RACE CARS?

05:37.900 --> 05:39.333
NO.

05:39.367 --> 05:42.267
RACE CAR STICKERS.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.267
- MILES, WE NEED BOUNDARIES.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.267
JUST BECAUSE
WE LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE

05:46.300 --> 05:47.833
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU NEED TO BE INVOLVED

05:47.867 --> 05:49.600
IN EVERY PART OF MY LIFE.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.233
- FINE.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.800
- WHEN I'M AT SCHOOL,
NO POPPING IN.

05:52.833 --> 05:53.800
BOUNDARIES.
GOT IT?

05:53.833 --> 05:55.300
- I GOT IT.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.267
NO POPPING INTO
YOUR SCHOOL LIFE.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.833
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

05:59.867 --> 06:01.500
- MILES!

06:01.533 --> 06:05.267
- NO, I'M NILES,
THE FAMOUS WESTERN COWPOKE.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.367
OH, AND I WAS JUST WONDERING

06:07.400 --> 06:10.300
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE,
UH, RACE CAR STICKERS.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.900
- YOU PROMISED.
- OKEY-DOKEY.

06:12.933 --> 06:14.500
I'LL LET MILES KNOW,
LITTLE LADY.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.533
IF I SEE HIM.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.200
SHE'S HERE.

06:22.233 --> 06:25.233
JUST ACT COOL.

06:30.500 --> 06:34.400
- YES, IT'S HOW I LET
PEOPLE KNOW I'M HAPPENING.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.733
- MRS. HATHAWAY,
ELEANOR KRAVITZ.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.300
- OH, IT'S A PLEASURE,
MRS. KRAVITZ.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.333
AND THIS IS
MY AMAZING DAUGHTER, FRANKIE.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.800
- AH, WELL, I MUST SAY,
FRANKIE,

06:46.833 --> 06:48.500
YOUR ESSAY WAS ONE
OF THE MOST UNIQUE

06:48.533 --> 06:49.600
I'VE READ IN YEARS.

06:49.633 --> 06:51.400
- WOW, THANKS.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.733
- SHE'S VERY CREATIVE.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.833
I GUESS SOMETIMES THE APPLE
DOES FALL CLOSE TO THE TREE.

06:59.133 --> 07:02.133
- I'VE ALWAYS HAD A LOVE AFFAIR
WITH THE WRITTEN WORD.

07:02.167 --> 07:05.633
"THE SAD CLOWN DANCES.
THE RED BALLOON FLOATS AWAY.

07:05.667 --> 07:08.700
PAPA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?"

07:08.733 --> 07:10.167
- SO FRANKIE, UH...

07:10.200 --> 07:13.167
YOUR ESSAY
WAS VERY INTERESTING.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.367
MIND IF WE DISCUSS IT?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.567
- ALL RIGHT, THE LADY
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE L-TRAIN,

07:18.600 --> 07:21.233
I DON'T BLAME HER.

07:21.267 --> 07:23.433
LOUIE, SCRAM.

07:23.467 --> 07:27.900
- NO WAY.
I WANT TO BASK IN MY GLORY.

07:27.933 --> 07:30.400
- UM, WHY DON'T WE SKIP
ALL THE ESSAY TALK?

07:30.433 --> 07:31.833
- FRANKIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:31.867 --> 07:33.400
DON'T BE MODEST.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.267
THIS--THIS ESSAY
IS FASCINATING.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.733
YOUR MAIN CHARACTER IS--
- I THINK WE GET IT.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.133
TALK TO ME ABOUT
TATER TOT DISTRIBUTION.

07:40.167 --> 07:43.367
MY SOURCES SAY
IT'S SIX TIMES A MONTH?

07:51.367 --> 07:52.667
WHAT IS GOING ON?

07:52.700 --> 07:54.233
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GET INTO THIS SCHOOL.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.533
- I DO.
IT'S JUST MY ESSAY.

07:56.567 --> 08:00.300
IT'S ABOUT A GHOST BOY NAMED
LOUIE WHO'S ALWAYS MESSING UP.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.900
THAT'S WHY I DON'T
WANT HER TALKING ABOUT IT

08:01.933 --> 08:03.167
IN FRONT OF HIM.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.467
LOUIE WOULD FREAK OUT.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.167
- I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.567
- I'M FREAKING OUT!

08:08.600 --> 08:12.367
- THEN AGAIN, MAYBE NOT.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.700
- IT'S JUST A PHOTO.

08:13.733 --> 08:17.733
LOOK CONFIDENT, WISE,
AND GYMNASTIC-Y.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.700
- AH, DEEP IN THOUGHT.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.233
YOU'RE CLEARLY CONSIDERING
THE IMPORTANCE

08:27.267 --> 08:30.900
OF RACE CAR ORNAMENTATION.

08:30.933 --> 08:32.800
- MILES, I'M BUSY.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.433
BOUNDARIES.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.267
- YOU SAID STAY OUT
OF YOUR SCHOOL BUSINESS.

08:36.300 --> 08:37.567
THIS IS THE BAKERY.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.733
- I'M WAITING TO BE INTERVIEWED.

08:38.767 --> 08:39.833
IT'S SCHOOL-RELATED.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.533
- FINE.

08:41.567 --> 08:45.567
BY THE WAY, NILES
THE COWBOY SAYS YOU'RE RUDE.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.833
- YEAH, GO WITH HANDS ON CHIN.
IT'S A CLASSIC.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.700
- YOU CAUGHT ME.

08:56.733 --> 08:58.700
SORRY, I'M WAITING
FOR A REPORTER

08:58.733 --> 09:00.400
AND I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

09:00.433 --> 09:02.533
- WAIT, YOU'RE
THE NEW GYMNASTICS CAPTAIN.

09:02.567 --> 09:03.767
TAYLOR, RIGHT?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.667
I'M A GRADE BELOW YOU.
BARRY.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.333
- OH, YEAH,
I'VE SEEN YOU AT SCHOOL.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.467
- LOOK, I'VE NEVER
BEEN INTERVIEWED,

09:09.500 --> 09:11.167
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE NERVOUS.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.300
- IT'S JUST I'M REPRESENTING
THE WHOLE TEAM.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.833
I DON'T WANNA
SAY ANYTHING STUPID.

09:15.867 --> 09:18.600
- YOUR TEAMMATES
ELECTED YOU CAPTAIN.

09:18.633 --> 09:20.333
YOU'D HAVE TO SAY
SOME PRETTY WACKY STUFF

09:20.367 --> 09:21.367
TO UPSET THEM.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.833
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

09:22.867 --> 09:24.733
"I'M THE GREATEST GYMNAST EVER.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.733
MY TEAM SHOULD ERECT
A STATUE OF ME."

09:29.333 --> 09:32.500
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I DID THAT
IN MY INTERVIEW?

09:32.533 --> 09:35.633
EVERY GIRL ON THE TEAM SHOULD
KNEEL BEFORE QUEEN TAYLOR.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.500
- AH, IT MUST
BE HARD FOR THE QUEEN

09:37.533 --> 09:39.567
TO PRETEND
TO LIKE HER TEAMMATES.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.167
THOSE PEASANTS.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.200
THEY'RE LUCKY TO BREATHE
THE SAME AIR I DO.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.200
- MY BACK ACHES

09:45.233 --> 09:46.267
FROM HAVING TO CARRY THEM

09:46.300 --> 09:47.800
AT EVERY MEET.

09:48.933 --> 09:51.300
- AND WE'RE DONE.
THANKS.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.167
- WAIT.
WHAT NOW?

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
- BARRY FINK.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.367
INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST,

09:55.400 --> 09:56.767
TWEEN DIVISION.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.667
- YOU'RE THE SCHOOL REPORTER.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.533
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

10:00.567 --> 10:02.667
- 'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING INTERESTING.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.600
NOW I HAVE PLENTY TO WRITE
ABOUT, AND IT'S ON TAPE.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.333
- YOU'RE GOING
TO USE THOSE QUOTES?

10:07.367 --> 10:08.700
I WAS JOKING.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.900
IF YOU WRITE THAT,

10:09.933 --> 10:11.633
MY FRIENDS
WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.233
- THANKS.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.800
OOH, NOW I ALSO
HAVE THE PERFECT PICTURE

10:14.833 --> 10:17.233
TO RUN WITH THE ARTICLE.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.733
- NO, WAIT.

10:18.767 --> 10:22.500
THAT POSE
WASN'T EVEN GYMNASTIC-Y.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.133
COME BACK!

10:24.167 --> 10:26.433
- YEE-HAW!

10:26.467 --> 10:28.800
- NOT YOU.

10:31.433 --> 10:32.833
- OH.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:32.867 --> 10:34.133
- UH, PEACHY.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.800
HOW ABOUT SOME TEA?

10:37.833 --> 10:40.333
- EVERYTHING LOUIE DOES
GOES WRONG?

10:40.367 --> 10:41.700
WHEN HE TRIED
TO BLOW OFF THE LIGHTS,

10:41.733 --> 10:43.467
INSTEAD HE BLEW OFF
HIS PANTS?

10:43.500 --> 10:46.467
MY BELT BUCKLE WAS BROKEN!

10:46.500 --> 10:49.367
- WE CAN DISCUSS THIS LATER.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.133
- YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN BLOW OUT THE LIGHTS?

10:56.600 --> 10:59.433
I'VE GOTTA GET A NEW BELT.

10:59.467 --> 11:03.267
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUIN
THIS FOR ME, SO KNOCK IT OFF.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.267
AND PUT ON YOUR PANTS.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.867
- TEA'S READY!

11:13.200 --> 11:16.700
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,
LOUIE'S PANTS?

11:16.733 --> 11:19.467
- LOUIE, I'M SORRY FOR CALLING
YOU A TOTAL DISASTER AS A GHOS--

11:19.500 --> 11:22.133
- YOU CALLED ME
A TOTAL DISASTER?

11:22.167 --> 11:24.133
THAT'S IT!

11:31.700 --> 11:34.133
- OH, JUST SOME OF THAT
WACKY NEW ORLEANS WEATHER.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.300
LEMON?

11:35.333 --> 11:37.333
OR A BOOK?

11:37.367 --> 11:38.733
- SON, STOP RIGHT NOW.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.767
OR I'LL--I'LL--

11:46.767 --> 11:48.767
- I'VE SEEN ALL I NEED TO SEE.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.333
- PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

11:50.367 --> 11:51.500
THIS IS A KIND HOME.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.167
A-A LOVING HOME.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.267
- WITH FLYING CATS!

11:59.400 --> 12:03.367
THE INTERVIEW'S OVER!

12:03.400 --> 12:06.400
- SO DO YOU CALL US
OR SHO--UM...

12:13.800 --> 12:15.233
- THIS IS AWFUL.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.467
YOUR BEST SHOT
AT PENNINGTON ACADEMY

12:16.500 --> 12:17.800
JUST RAN OUT THE DOOR.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.800
- WITH A CAT ON HER FACE.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.467
- I'VE GOTTA CALL HER AND PRAY
SHE HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.500
AND A RABIES SHOT.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.833
- HEY, YOU.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.333
- BETTER STAY AWAY.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.500
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN LOUIE'S GONNA MESS UP.

12:33.533 --> 12:34.767
END QUOTE.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.600
- JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.400
- THERE'S NOTHING TO EXPLAIN.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.233
NOW I KNOW WHAT
YOU REALLY THINK OF ME.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.733
YOU THINK
I'M A CRUMMY GHOST?

12:42.767 --> 12:45.800
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE A CRUMMY FRIEND.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.700
- THE GOOD NEWS
IS I TRACKED DOWN THE CAT.

12:48.733 --> 12:52.733
THE BAD NEWS, HE HAD
HUMAN HAIR IN HIS CLAWS.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.533
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP THINGS.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.633
- LOUIE, YOUR BEHAVIOR
HAS EARNED YOU A TIME OUT.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.633
NOW, GO TO YOUR ROOM.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.300
- SORRY, LOUIE.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.400
- SAVE IT FOR YOUR NEXT ESSAY.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.600
I GOT KRAVITZ ON THE PHONE.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.567
I TOLD HER IT WAS ALL
A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING,

13:11.600 --> 13:13.100
THEN I STARTED
RECITING HAIKU.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.467
SHE CUT ME OFF
AND AGREED TO COME BACK.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.567
NOW WE JUST NEED A WAY
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.800
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER
IT WAS MAGIC?

13:21.833 --> 13:23.400
- I-I DON'T GET IT.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.833
- JUST TELL KRAVITZ
THE WHOLE THING

13:25.867 --> 13:27.667
WAS PART OF FRANKIE'S
MAGIC ACT.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.733
THEN I RECREATE
EVERYTHING KRAVITZ SAW,

13:30.767 --> 13:33.500
BUT MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE FRANKIE'S DOING IT.

13:33.533 --> 13:35.733
- THIS COULD WORK.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.800
MAGIC IS JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF HER DIVERSE INTERESTS.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.800
- I GOTTA ADMIT,
FOR GROWNUPS,

13:40.833 --> 13:44.167
YOU GUYS HAVE PUT TOGETHER
A DECENT PLAN.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.800
- OF COURSE.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.067
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

13:50.667 --> 13:53.667
- THIRD TIME TODAY!

13:58.333 --> 14:00.667
- WOMEN.
- YOU SAID IT, BROTHER.

14:02.900 --> 14:06.367
- PREACHING TO THE CHOIR,
MY MAN.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.567
- MILES, SORRY
FOR BRUSHING YOU OFF EARLIER,

14:09.600 --> 14:11.433
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.233
A REPORTER AT SCHOOL IS ABOUT
TO RUN A HORRIBLE STORY ON ME,

14:14.267 --> 14:15.467
AND I--
- OH, I'M SORRY.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.433
THIS SOUNDS SCHOOL-RELATED.

14:17.467 --> 14:20.100
BOUNDARIES, REMEMBER?

14:20.133 --> 14:22.533
- MILES, I'M SERIOUS.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.733
THIS STORY COULD COST ME
ALL MY FRIENDS.

14:24.767 --> 14:29.233
- WELL, IN THAT CASE...

14:29.267 --> 14:32.400
LET'S SEE IN MY LITTLE SCHEDULE
I'VE GOT HERE.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.833
OH! I CAN PENCIL YOU IN
FOR SPRING.

14:39.867 --> 14:42.633
I WOULDN'T WANNA
"POP IN" UNANNOUNCED.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.633
- JUST FORGET IT.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.133
- TAYLOR THINKS I HAVE A PROBLEM
RESPECTING BOUNDARIES.

14:50.167 --> 14:51.267
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

14:51.300 --> 14:52.767
YOU?

14:52.800 --> 14:56.200
NO.
THAT'S CRAZY.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.733
WHY ARE YOU MAD?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.667
FRANKIE THINKS
I'M A BAD GHOST.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.633
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT--
AAH!

15:04.667 --> 15:06.700
YOU?

15:06.733 --> 15:09.133
NO, THAT'S CRAZY.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.500
- WELL, SHE DOES.

15:11.533 --> 15:13.133
SHE WROTE ALL ABOUT IT.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.667
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

15:14.700 --> 15:18.367
- WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT HER SCHOOL ESSAY?

15:18.400 --> 15:19.633
DID YOU READ THE WHOLE THING?

15:19.667 --> 15:22.433
- OF COURSE I READ
THE WHOLE THING.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.233
WELL, MOST OF IT.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.833
A LOT OF IT.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.667
THE FIRST PAGE.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.633
- LOUIE, THE ESSAY ISN'T
ABOUT YOU BEING A BAD GHOST.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.533
IT'S ABOUT
HOW DETERMINED YOU ARE.

15:33.567 --> 15:36.600
AND NO MATTER HOW MANY THINGS
GO WRONG, YOU NEVER GIVE UP.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.767
SHE CALLS YOU
ONE OF HER HEROES.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.633
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:42.667 --> 15:44.567
- OH, I READ IT
WHILE I WAS HANGING OUT

15:44.600 --> 15:46.267
IN HER BACKPACK.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.200
- YOU HANG OUT
IN FRANKIE'S BACKPACK?

15:48.233 --> 15:50.200
- WELL, YEAH,
ONLY WHEN TAYLOR'S BACKPACK

15:50.233 --> 15:51.500
ISN'T AROUND.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.833
- OH, MY GOSH.

15:54.867 --> 15:57.367
I HAVE NO BOUNDARIES.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.667
TAYLOR'S RIGHT.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.700
AND I BLEW HER OFF
IN HER TIME OF NEED?

16:00.733 --> 16:02.200
I GOTTA FIX THIS.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.800
- BEFORE YOU GO,
ANY CHANCE

16:03.833 --> 16:06.267
YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA COPY
OF FRANKIE'S ESSAY?

16:06.300 --> 16:07.800
- SURE, LOUIE.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.233
I'M SUCH A WEIRDO
I GO AROUND

16:09.267 --> 16:12.433
MAKING COPIES
OF PEOPLE'S ESSAYS.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.633
SECOND DRAWER.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.667
UNDERNEATH TAYLOR'S DIARY.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.367
- TAYLOR, IT'S NEWSPAPER DAY.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.833
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

16:23.867 --> 16:26.333
- YEAH, THE NEWSPAPER
COMES OUT TODAY.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.567
EXCITING!

16:29.600 --> 16:31.567
- BARRY!

16:31.600 --> 16:34.400
THERE'S THAT TALL DRINK
OF HANDSOME.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.733
- I'M STILL RUNNING
THE STORY, HATHAWAY.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.333
- I HATE YOU.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.600
- SORRY, TOOTS.
SCANDAL SELLS.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.467
- SO YOU ADMIT
YOUR STORY IS A LIE?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
- OF COURSE IT'S A LIE.
SO WHAT?

16:45.533 --> 16:47.800
THESE STOOGES
BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY READ.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.500
THEY'RE IDIOTS.

16:50.533 --> 16:54.200
I END UP
LOOKING LIKE A GENIUS.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.733
- IS THAT WHAT A GENIUS
LOOKS LIKE?

17:01.767 --> 17:03.567
- SOMEONE BOOBY-TRAPPED
MY LOCKER.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.133
BLEH.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.767
HEY, WHERE
ARE ALL THE NEWSPAPERS?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.233
THEY WERE STORED IN HERE.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.533
- OH.

17:12.567 --> 17:15.533
YOU DID THIS, HATHAWAY.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.633
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.800
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SAID
IS STILL HERE ON MY RECORDER.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.200
LISTEN TO THIS, EVERYONE.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.667
- SO YOU ADMIT
YOUR STORY IS A LIE?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.600
- OF COURSE IT'S A LIE.
SO WHAT?

17:27.633 --> 17:29.800
THESE STOOGES WILL BELIEVE
ANYTHING THEY READ.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.467
THEY'RE IDIOTS.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.533
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT YOU GUYS.

17:33.567 --> 17:36.700
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.
SUPER SMART.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.100
WAIT!
HEY, COME BACK!

17:40.133 --> 17:43.300
I'M BARRY FINK!
I AM THE NEWS!

17:49.800 --> 17:53.367
MILES, I KNOW
YOU MUST BE BEHIND THIS.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.567
- DON'T BE MAD.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.733
I KNOW HOW
YOU DON'T WANT ME

17:55.767 --> 17:57.167
BARGING INTO
YOUR SCHOOL LIFE.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.233
- MILES, YOU TOTALLY SAVED ME.

17:59.267 --> 18:00.400
THAT WAS AWESOME.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.800
FORGET ALL THAT
BOUNDARY STUFF.

18:01.833 --> 18:03.167
I WAS WRONG TO SAY THAT.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.533
- NO, NO.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.800
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.633
I NEED TO RESPECT
YOUR PRIVACY MORE.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.200
- LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,
WE'RE LIKE A FAMILY NOW,

18:10.233 --> 18:12.800
AND FAMILY SOMETIMES MEDDLES
IN EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.600
- THANKS, TAYLOR.

18:14.633 --> 18:18.167
- HEY, YOU WANNA JUMP IN
MY BACKPACK FOR THE RIDE HOME?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.533
- SURE.

18:19.567 --> 18:23.567
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

18:28.633 --> 18:31.067
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING BACK, ELEANOR.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.167
UH, MAY I CALL YOU ELEANOR?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.333
- NO.
UH-UH.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.267
JUST, UH,
SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.233
THIS PLACE FREAKS ME OUT.

18:38.267 --> 18:41.067
- I PROMISE WE CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING YOU SAW.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.833
- YEAH, WELL, MAKE IT QUICK.
OH, WAIT.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.600
JUST, UH...

18:45.667 --> 18:47.367
CAN'T LOSE ANY MORE HAIR.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.233
- OKAY. OKAY.

18:52.867 --> 18:57.167
INTRODUCING MY WELL-ROUNDED,
STRAIGHT-A,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.700
COMMUNITY-SERVICE-LOVING
DAUGHTER,

18:58.733 --> 19:01.800
THE GREAT FRANKINI.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.200
- OH.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.533
ALL THOSE WEIRD THINGS

19:08.567 --> 19:10.633
YOU SAW EARLIER,
THEY WERE JUST MAGIC TRICKS.

19:10.667 --> 19:15.333
- I WAS ATTACKED
BY A FLOATING CAT.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.867
- MAGIC.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.400
OBSERVE.

19:18.433 --> 19:21.900
PIANO, BRING US MUSIC.

19:21.933 --> 19:23.733
SHOO-BA-DEE-DOO!

19:23.767 --> 19:24.800
- RAY.

19:24.833 --> 19:28.800
SHOO-BA-DEE-DOO!
SHOO-BA-DEE-DOO!

19:28.833 --> 19:31.833
YOU ARE SO PRETTY.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.400
- I'M UP.
I'M UP.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.400
TRY SOMETHING ELSE, FRANKIE.

19:37.433 --> 19:40.300
- UM...FLYING BOOKS.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.700
- SHOO-BA-DEE-DOO.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.800
- UH.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.300
- OKAY.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE DONE.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.467
BUT, UH, THANK YOU

19:53.500 --> 19:55.167
FOR YOUR INTEREST
IN PENNINGTON ACADEMY.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.267
- NO, WAIT.
NOTHING'S WEIRD!

19:56.300 --> 19:57.467
- OH! OH!

19:57.500 --> 20:01.467
WHAT WAS THAT?

20:01.500 --> 20:05.900
- IT'S THE L-TRAIN,
HERE TO SAVE THE DAY.

20:05.933 --> 20:07.133
- GREAT.

20:07.167 --> 20:08.533
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.500
WATCH THIS, MRS. K.

20:10.533 --> 20:13.533
FLYING PEACOCK.

20:16.233 --> 20:19.233
FLYING COUCH.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.467
SERIOUSLY?

20:25.500 --> 20:27.267
FLYING FRANKINI.

20:28.733 --> 20:31.267
- OOPS.
- PUT HER DOWN!

20:31.300 --> 20:32.700
- WHA--

20:32.733 --> 20:35.300
- HEY, I GOT ONE RIGHT.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.067
- MRS. KRAVITZ.
UH, MRS. KRAVITZ--

20:37.100 --> 20:40.300
- THAT WAS SPECTACULAR.

20:40.333 --> 20:41.700
- HOW ON EARTH
DID YOU DO THAT?

20:41.733 --> 20:45.433
- A MAGICIAN
NEVER REVEALS HER SECRETS.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.833
- FOR A SECOND THERE,
I-I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

20:47.867 --> 20:49.267
THIS HOUSE WAS HAUNTED.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.667
- THAT'S SO FUNNY.

20:54.700 --> 20:58.533
- PENNINGTON WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE SUCH A CREATIVE TALENT.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.767
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.833
both: YES.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.533
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE MAD AT ME.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.200
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO HELP?

21:07.233 --> 21:09.167
- I READ THE REST
OF YOUR ESSAY.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.433
AND, AS YOUR HERO,
I COULDN'T LET YOU DOWN.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.400
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.633
- MRS. KRAVITZ
FORGOT HER HANDBAG.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.400
- HERE.
LET ME GET IT FOR YOU.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.533
LET THE WAVE OF RELAXATION

21:31.567 --> 21:33.400
RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOU.

21:33.433 --> 21:36.500
FEEL THAT?
YEAH, YOU DO.

21:36.533 --> 21:38.300
WOW.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.733
I ACTUALLY DO FEEL BETTER.

21:39.767 --> 21:43.533
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
TO THIS YOGA.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.167
- AH, YES.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.200
EASTERN PHILOSOPHY
OFTEN HAS A CALMING EFFECT,

21:48.233 --> 21:49.300
LIKE HAIKU.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.667
MOCKED FOR MY POEMS,

21:53.700 --> 21:55.633
AND YET I WRITE ON BRAVELY.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.667
MY WORDS DANCE, SMILE, CRY.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.700
- THANK YOU, SON.

22:03.733 --> 22:06.733
- YOU'RE WELCOME, POPS.
