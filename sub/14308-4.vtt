AAH!

02:33.500 --> 02:36.533

THAT SHOOTS

02:36.567 --> 02:39.133
POPCORN BALLS OUT OF A CANNON
AND INTO THE AUDIENCE?

02:39.167 --> 02:41.067
- UH-HUH.

02:42.467 --> 02:45.067
MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.667

03:13.933 --> 03:15.700
DO I KNOW THE PHRASE
THAT PAYS?

03:15.733 --> 03:18.367
OF COURSE I KNOW
THE PHRASE THAT PAYS.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.067
WHAT'S THE PHRASE THAT PAYS?

03:21.067 --> 03:24.500
"NO ONE PLAYS MORE HITS
THAN COCO AND THE FISH HEAD

03:24.533 --> 03:26.633
IN THE MORNING."

03:26.667 --> 03:28.067
YES, I WON!

03:29.900 --> 03:32.100
both: WAIT.
WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?

03:32.133 --> 03:33.667
- I WON THE TICKETS.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.700
NOW EMMA AND I
CAN GO TO THE CONCERT.

03:35.733 --> 03:37.967
- CORRECTION--
I WON THE TICKETS,

03:38.067 --> 03:40.567
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE
MY FRIEND NINA.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.367
- FRANKIE,
I WAS THE HUNDREDTH CALLER.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.067
- YEAH, BUT I KNEW
THE PHRASE THAT PAID.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.333
- GIRLS!

03:50.367 --> 03:51.533
I HAVE HAD IT
WITH YOU TWO.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.300
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.733
- THAT WAS RUDE.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.900
- OKAY.
CALM DOWN.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.567
BE THANKFUL
FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS' HEALTH

04:02.600 --> 04:06.600
AND THAT NO ONE CAN
SEE YOU TALKING TO YOURSELF.

04:06.633 --> 04:09.400
- I SEE YOU.

04:09.433 --> 04:12.467
I REALLY HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.867
- I SAW WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.067
A LITTLE PARENTING ADVICE--

04:16.100 --> 04:18.533
TEACH THE KIDS TO HANDLE
THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.633
THAT WAY, THEY WON'T HAVE
TO RUN TO MOMMY

04:20.667 --> 04:22.467
TO SOLVE EVERY LITTLE ISSUE.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.067
- NO OFFENSE, RAY,

04:26.100 --> 04:28.100
BUT YOU'VE NEVER HAD
TO DEAL WITH GIRLS.

04:28.133 --> 04:31.067
- GIRLS ARE A WALK IN THE PARK.
TRUST ME.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.500
WELL, IF YOU THINK GIRLS
ARE SO EASY,

04:34.533 --> 04:36.600
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
MY GIRLS

04:36.633 --> 04:37.700
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

04:37.733 --> 04:40.300
AND I'LL WATCH THE BOYS?

04:41.433 --> 04:42.533
- MM-MM.

04:42.567 --> 04:43.767
I'M IN.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.467
I'LL ENJOY
THE RELAXING BREAK.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.667
- ME TOO.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.467
IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE.

04:50.500 --> 04:55.500
[both grunting,
shouting]

04:57.600 --> 04:59.600
- ENJOY.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.533
NOW,
BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND,

05:06.567 --> 05:10.500
DR. SMOOTH HIMSELF--
- RAY!

05:10.533 --> 05:13.367
MOM SAID THAT TODAY
WE'RE YOUR HEADACHE,

05:13.400 --> 05:15.967
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.967
- YES, SO PLEASE TELL TAYLOR
I GET THE CONCERT TICKETS.

05:19.067 --> 05:22.467
DON'T SPARE HER FEELINGS.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.067
- YOU KIDS STILL HAVEN'T
WORKED OUT

05:24.100 --> 05:26.600
THAT LITTLE PROBLEM YET?

05:26.633 --> 05:28.833
WELL, IT'S TIME
I TEACH YOU TWO ABOUT--

05:28.867 --> 05:31.400
- MY PHRASE THAT PAYS.
MY TICKETS.

05:31.433 --> 05:32.833
- YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE
THE THREE CHADS.

05:32.867 --> 05:34.600
YOU ONLY WANT POPCORN SHOT
AT YOU.

05:34.633 --> 05:37.067
- UM, DUH!

05:37.067 --> 05:40.367
- GIRLS.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.533
- STOP GRABBING THE TICKETS!

05:42.567 --> 05:46.067
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU THINK YOU CAN IGNORE ME?

05:46.067 --> 05:47.933
TRY IGNORING THIS.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.300
HELLO?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.933
STOP FIGHTING
AND LOOK AT ME.

05:53.967 --> 05:55.367
I'M A MAGICAL CREATURE

05:55.400 --> 05:58.067
FROM THE LAND OF FAIRIES
AND RAINBOWS.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.600
- FRANKIE,
GIVE ME THE TICKETS!

05:59.633 --> 06:00.933
- THEY'RE MINE!

06:00.967 --> 06:02.700
- YOO-HOO!

06:02.733 --> 06:04.900
CHECK OUT MY PINK MANE.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.533
OOH.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.667
PRETTY.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.400
- FRANKIE, I MIGHT DIE
IF EMMA AND I CAN'T GO

06:12.433 --> 06:13.867
TO THIS CONCERT.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.867
- I'M WILLING TO TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.133
- HEY!
- GIVE THOSE BACK!

06:21.167 --> 06:23.100
- NOT UNTIL YOU STOP YELLING

06:23.133 --> 06:24.833
AND START LISTENING
TO EACH OTHER.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.967
NOW I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW TO WORK THIS OUT

06:27.067 --> 06:27.967
ON YOUR OWN.

06:28.067 --> 06:30.633
TAKE THIS HAT.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.867
- I DO FEEL BETTER.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.567
GOOD PARENTING TIP, RAY.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.900
- NO, THIS IS
A TALKING HAT.

06:38.933 --> 06:40.733
WHOEVER WEARS IT CAN SPEAK,

06:40.767 --> 06:42.500
WHILE THE OTHER PERSON HAS
TO LISTEN.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.700
IT'LL TEACH YOU TO
COMMUNICATE AND PROBLEM-SOLVE.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.067
NOW, GO WORK THIS OUT.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.433
- FINE.

06:48.467 --> 06:51.067
GIVE ME THE STUPID HAT.
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

06:51.067 --> 06:55.067
IT'S A TALKING HAT,
NOT A STUPID HAT.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.400
- SORRY, RAY.

06:56.433 --> 07:00.700
YOU DON'T HAVE THE HAT,
SO SHH.

07:00.733 --> 07:02.733
- SHH.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.667
- OKAY, BOYS.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.633
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.933
WHAT YOU TWO NEED
IS STRUCTURE,

07:11.967 --> 07:13.667
SO I'M GOING
TO HAVE YOU CHANNEL

07:13.700 --> 07:17.600
ALL THAT WONDERFUL ENERGY
INTO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.067
I'M PUTTING YOU TO WORK.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.833
- COOL!
- AWW!

07:23.400 --> 07:26.567
- NOT EVERYTHING YOU DO
HAS TO BE A COMPETITION.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.067
YOU'LL SEE WORKING TOGETHER
CAN BE FUN TOO.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.733
HAVE YOU MET US?

07:32.767 --> 07:35.067
- YOU GUYS ARE GOING
TO HELP ME

07:35.067 --> 07:36.567
BY DECORATING GINGERBREAD MEN.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.667
AND NO GHOST SHORTCUTS.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.600
THAT WAY, YOU'LL LEARN
THE WONDERFUL SATISFACTION

07:42.633 --> 07:43.833
OF A HARD DAY'S WORK.

07:43.867 --> 07:45.533
SOUNDS FUN, RIGHT?

07:45.567 --> 07:47.900
- YIPPEE.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.467
I BET I CAN DECORATE FASTER
THAN YOU.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.700
- LOUIE, MICHELLE SAID
NO COMPETING.

07:55.733 --> 07:56.700
- I GET IT.

07:56.733 --> 07:58.400
YOU'RE AFRAID TO LOSE.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.933
BESIDES, I'VE ALREADY
DONE THREE.

08:00.967 --> 08:04.767
YOU'VE ONLY DONE TWO.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.900
YOU BETTER COUNT AGAIN.

08:17.933 --> 08:21.133
LOOKS LIKE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.933
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU ONLY HAVE...

08:29.467 --> 08:30.933
NONE!

08:32.900 --> 08:35.133
- YOU ARE GOING DOWN.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.733
- OH, YEAH.
THIS IS GONNA BE A CRUMB BATH.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.067
- OH!

08:47.567 --> 08:49.500
- AHH.

08:49.533 --> 08:50.967
QUIET.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.300
RAY, YOU SLY FOX,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.533
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.067
LET ME GUESS,

08:57.100 --> 09:00.467
AFTER CALMLY TALKING IT OUT--
GAH!

09:03.767 --> 09:06.467
- NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.433
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE MIGHT HAVE

09:09.467 --> 09:11.467
TAKEN ADVANTAGE
OF HER SIZE.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.700
- IF YOU SAY SO.

09:12.733 --> 09:15.133
- HELP!

09:15.167 --> 09:17.167
HELP!

09:20.067 --> 09:23.533
THAT GIRL IS
A SHE-DEVIL!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.567
I'M JUST AN INNOCENT
UNDERSIZED NINE-YEAR-OLD

09:29.600 --> 09:32.133
TRYING TO GET BY
IN THIS CRAZY WORLD.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.133
LOOK AT THIS!

09:38.733 --> 09:40.367
- I THINK SHE LOOKS GREAT.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.800
- STOP!

09:41.833 --> 09:43.900
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
WORK THIS OUT YOURSELVES,

09:43.933 --> 09:47.367
BUT YOU TWO NEED A SERIOUS
LECTURE ABOUT COMPROMISE.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.100
- YOU CAN LECTURE ME
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.433
I'M DONE HERE.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.933
- FINE, LET'S GO.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.067
- NO WAY.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.867
I'VE SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH HER.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.367
- OKAY.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.000
THEN I GUESS IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO SPLIT.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.533
- NO, I'M SPLITTING.

10:06.733 --> 10:10.967
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
THIS LECTURE TWICE.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.533
- THIS IS SO CREEPY.

10:14.567 --> 10:17.733
- I HAVE HALF A MIND
TO BE OFFENDED BY THAT.

10:17.767 --> 10:18.767
HALF A MIND?

10:18.800 --> 10:21.100
GET IT?

10:22.467 --> 10:26.933
- DID FRANKIE GET
THE FUNNY HALF?

10:26.967 --> 10:28.467
- NOW LOOK,
I THINK YOU GIRLS

10:28.500 --> 10:30.467
ARE MISSING
THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.567
THERE ARE TWO TICKETS.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.000
YOU WON THEM TOGETHER,

10:33.033 --> 10:34.633
AND YOU BOTH WANT TO GO
TO THE CONCERT.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.467
NOW COULD YOU PLEASE STOP
DOING THAT

10:36.500 --> 10:39.400
AND TRY TO FOCUS
ON WHAT I'M SAYING?

10:39.433 --> 10:41.500
REMEMBER,
FRIENDS COME AND GO,

10:41.533 --> 10:44.000
BUT SISTERS ARE FOREVER.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.533
SO TAKE WHOEVER YOU LIKE,

10:45.567 --> 10:47.033
BUT I THINK
IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE

10:47.067 --> 10:49.533
IF YOU WENT WITH SOMEONE
THAT MEANS THE MOST TO YOU.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.767
- I GET IT, RAY.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.067
THANKS.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.500
- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

10:54.533 --> 10:56.567
I KNOW THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.900
- I KNEW YOU'D GET IT.
- MM-HMM.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.600
HEY, GOOD-LOOKING!

11:02.633 --> 11:05.433
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MY BETTER HALF.

11:05.467 --> 11:06.867
CARE TO JOIN ME?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.900
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.600
SO...

11:17.633 --> 11:19.600
THE GIRLS' PROBLEM--
SOLVED.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.400
TURNS OUT ALL THEY NEEDED
WAS A SUPERIOR PARENT

11:22.433 --> 11:24.767
TO SHOW THEM HOW TO MAKE
GOOD DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.633
- THAT'S FUNNY,
IT TURNED OUT

11:27.667 --> 11:29.067
ALL THE BOYS NEEDED WAS

11:29.067 --> 11:30.467
A SUPERIOR PARENT...

11:30.500 --> 11:33.433
CHANNEL THEIR ENERGY.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.700
- NOPE.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.533
THAT'S OUR SECRET SIGNAL.

11:42.567 --> 11:45.067
IT MEANS THE BOYS
WANT MORE WORK.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.867
- HI, MS. HATHAWAY.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.433
WHERE'S TAYLOR?

11:53.467 --> 11:54.633
I WANTED TO THANK HER
FOR INVITING ME

11:54.667 --> 11:56.067
TO THE THREE CHADS CONCERT.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.300
- OOH. GREAT.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.667
YOU MUST BE EXCITED.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.500
- I LIKE QUIET CHAD THE BEST.
- MM-HMM.

12:02.533 --> 12:05.867
- ALTHOUGH
CUTE CHAD IS SO CUTE.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.067
NOW I FEEL BAD
FOR POUTY CHAD.

12:08.067 --> 12:12.667
HE'S WORKED REALLY HARD
TO FIX THAT LAZY EYE.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.867
- YOU'RE GOING
TO THE CONCERT TOO?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.100
FRANKIE INVITED ME.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.367
I GUESS
WE'RE ALL GOING TOGETHER.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.067
- I BELIEVE TAYLOR AND FRANKIE
ARE BOTH UPSTAIRS.

12:25.067 --> 12:28.600
THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:28.633 --> 12:31.900
I THOUGHT THERE WERE
ONLY TWO TICKETS.

12:31.933 --> 12:34.367
BUT I COUNT FOUR PEOPLE
GOING.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.933
SOUNDS LIKE A PROBLEM, RAY.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.733
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.300
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING
BACK IN THE KITCHEN?

12:44.900 --> 12:45.867
- THEY'RE MINE!
- FRANKIE, THEY'RE MINE!

12:45.900 --> 12:47.400
I WON THEM!

12:47.433 --> 12:48.600
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE
GETTING UPSTAIRS?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.433
- TAYLOR, I CAN'T BELIEVE

12:59.467 --> 13:01.467
YOU INVITED ME WHEN YOU
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TICKETS.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.733
- I DO HAVE THE TICKETS.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.733
FRANKIE AND NINA AREN'T GOING.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.733
- WE ARE TOO!

13:06.767 --> 13:08.600
SERIOUSLY,
IF NINA DOESN'T GO,

13:08.633 --> 13:11.267
SHE MAY LOSE IT.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.633
LOOK AT HER.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.667
- COME ON, FRANKIE,
TELL ME WHERE THE BATHROOM IS.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.267
- SHH.

13:18.300 --> 13:21.267
- TAYLOR, FRANKIE,
WE NEED TO TALK.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.633
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.400
IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN POUTY CHAD SINGS,

13:25.433 --> 13:28.567
"OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH,

13:28.600 --> 13:29.833
"I'M HURT.

13:29.867 --> 13:32.700
"OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH.

13:32.733 --> 13:36.300
REAL HURT."

13:36.333 --> 13:39.267
- NO, EMMA, IT'S MORE
LIKE WHEN QUIET CHAD SINGS

13:39.300 --> 13:43.267
"OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, I GOT YOUR BACK.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.767
"OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH,

13:45.800 --> 13:49.500
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS NOT WHACK."

13:50.700 --> 13:53.700
- YO, HATHAWAY GIRLS.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.800
MEET THE UNICORN
IN THE HALLWAY.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.900
NOW.

13:57.933 --> 14:00.067
- UH, EXCUSE US.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.733
FRANKIE AND I ARE
GONNA GO WORK THIS OUT

14:01.767 --> 14:03.967
IN THE HALL.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.867
- IF THE HORSE
SPLITS IN HALF,

14:06.900 --> 14:10.900
I CALL THE FRONT.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.667
WHY DID YOU GUYS INVITE
THOSE GIRLS?

14:14.700 --> 14:15.867
DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

14:15.900 --> 14:17.833
- YEAH, YOU SAID
TO CHOOSE SOMEONE

14:17.867 --> 14:19.267
WHO MEANT SOMETHING TO ME.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.567
- I HEARD THAT TOO.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.300
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO PICK EACH OTHER.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.933
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- NOT FUNNY.

14:29.967 --> 14:33.833
REMEMBER, FRIENDS COME AND GO,
BUT SISTERS ARE FOREVER.

14:33.867 --> 14:35.300
- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.267
JUST TELL US
WHO GETS THE TICKETS.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.467
- FINE.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.933
YOU WANT MY DECISION?

14:39.967 --> 14:42.067
HERE IT IS.

14:42.067 --> 14:45.633
NOBODY'S GOING TO THE CONCERT.

14:53.967 --> 14:57.433
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAPPENED HERE?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.733
- LOUIE STARTED IT!
- MILES STARTED IT!

15:03.767 --> 15:05.633
- I DON'T CARE
WHO STARTED IT.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.467
LOOK, I HAVE
AN IMPORTANT CLIENT COMING.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.300
WEDDING CAKES ARE BIG MONEY.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.400
ANYONE HERE?

15:13.433 --> 15:14.600
THAT'S THEM.

15:14.633 --> 15:18.333
I WILL DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.600
- WE NEED TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

15:22.633 --> 15:26.533
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO THE ULTIMATE GHOST CONTEST--

15:26.567 --> 15:28.400
A LEVITATION BATTLE.

15:28.433 --> 15:31.467
- WE CAN'T.
MICHELLE SAID TO KNOCK IT OFF.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.433
- I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.633
- BAWK ALL YOU WANT, LOUIE.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

15:46.667 --> 15:47.967
I'M NOT FIVE.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.933
CLUCKY CLUCK.

15:52.967 --> 15:56.467
- DID YOU JUST
CLUCKY CLUCK ME?

15:56.500 --> 15:58.933
LET'S DO THIS!

16:06.900 --> 16:09.533
- RAY,
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

16:09.567 --> 16:11.267
- SURE.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.900
- SO AFTER OUR FRIENDS
WENT HOME,

16:13.933 --> 16:15.967
FRANKIE AND I
STARTED TALKING...

16:16.067 --> 16:18.333
- THAT WAS
AFTER THE YELLING, PINCHING,

16:18.367 --> 16:21.633
AND DISCOVERING
NINA'S "ACCIDENT."

16:23.933 --> 16:25.567
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.900
FRANKIE'S NOT THE WORST SISTER
IN THE WORLD.

16:27.933 --> 16:29.700
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUN
IF WE'D GONE

16:29.733 --> 16:32.367
TO THE CONCERT TOGETHER.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.933
- SORRY FOR BEING
SO BRATTY.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.500
- WOW.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.833
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.267
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.367
BECAUSE OF THAT,

16:42.400 --> 16:45.500
I'M GONNA LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

16:45.533 --> 16:49.267
BOOM!

16:49.300 --> 16:50.767
I NEVER DESTROYED
THE TICKETS.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
IT WAS JUST A GHOST ILLUSION
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.667
YOU CAN BOTH GO
TO THE CONCERT AFTER ALL.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.567
HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?

17:00.700 --> 17:03.067
- THAT'S SO TWISTED!

17:03.100 --> 17:06.133
- YOU LIED TO US!

17:08.800 --> 17:10.467
- BE RIGHT BACK
WITH YOUR CAKE.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.367
PREPARE TO BE WOWED!

17:14.400 --> 17:16.367
LOOK AT YOU TWO.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.267
YOU'VE STOPPED FIGHTING.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.900
YOU CLEANED THE COUNTER.

17:19.933 --> 17:22.900
YOU REALLY TOOK MY WORDS
TO HEART.

17:22.933 --> 17:25.067
- CAN'T...HOLD IT...

17:25.067 --> 17:27.500
ANYMORE.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.567
- YES!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.067
VICTORY!

17:34.067 --> 17:36.567
I FINALLY BEAT YOU!

17:41.733 --> 17:42.733
- UH-OH.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.967
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT GOOD.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.533
M-M-M--

17:49.567 --> 17:51.667
MY CAKE!

17:51.700 --> 17:53.267
IT'S--IT'S RUINED!

17:53.300 --> 17:54.733
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

17:54.767 --> 17:57.733
I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT I COULD GET THROUGH

17:57.767 --> 18:00.833
TO YOU BOYS.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.400
BUT INSTEAD
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED

18:03.433 --> 18:06.900
IS I LOST A HUGE CHANCE
TO MAKE MONEY

18:06.933 --> 18:08.900
FOR THE SHOP.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.800
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

18:10.833 --> 18:13.900
I HAVE TO COLLECT MYSELF.

18:21.933 --> 18:25.300
- I DON'T KNOW, MILES.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.467
BUT WHY WERE
HER EYES LEAKING?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.800
AND WHY DO I FEEL SO BAD?

18:31.333 --> 18:33.400
I DON'T KNOW.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.833
DAD NEVER DOES THAT.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.367
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.067
GIRLS ARE TOO HARD!

18:39.067 --> 18:41.833
I WANT MY BOYS BACK!

18:41.867 --> 18:43.767
- YOU'VE RUINED MY LIFE!

18:43.800 --> 18:45.367
- HOW CAN I EVER
TRUST YOU AGAIN?

18:48.400 --> 18:49.900
- SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

18:49.933 --> 18:53.467
I HAD SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.833
WELL, I HAVE
SOME INTERESTING NEWS.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.333
YOU SEE--

18:58.367 --> 18:59.567
WHEN DID YOU SAY
YOUR WEDDING WAS?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.067
- TONIGHT.
IT'S INTIMATE.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.867
JUST A FEW CLOSE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.600
- OH, HOW FUN.

19:05.633 --> 19:09.333
WELL, THE NEWS IS YOUR WEDDING
IS NOW TOMORROW

19:09.367 --> 19:12.833
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE CAKE
WILL BE READY.

19:12.867 --> 19:16.567
SURPRISE.

19:18.633 --> 19:22.100
WHAT NOW?

19:22.133 --> 19:24.433
- WHOA!

19:24.467 --> 19:28.533
OH!
WHAT A PRESENTATION!

19:28.567 --> 19:31.333
OH, YOU HAD ME WORRIED THERE
FOR A MOMENT.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.100
- YOU REALLY GO ALL OUT.

19:33.133 --> 19:36.600
WE ARE PREPARED
TO BE WOWED!

19:39.633 --> 19:42.967
both: WOW.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.967
- WOW.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.333
WHAT IS THAT?

19:49.367 --> 19:51.833
- I THINK IT MIGHT BE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAKE

19:51.867 --> 19:55.567
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.767
- LOOK AT HER EYES,
SHE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.533
- I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.100
- LOOK, WE'RE NOT PAYING
FOR THAT MESS.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.933
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, HONEY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.867
- BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO SERVE OUR GUESTS?

20:05.900 --> 20:06.900
DOUGHNUTS?

20:06.933 --> 20:08.567
- WE SELL DOUGHNUTS.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.600
REALLY?
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.533
- WE'RE--
WE'RE SORRY, MICHELLE.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.400
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.367
LOUIE AND I
WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER,

20:23.400 --> 20:24.600
JUST LIKE YOU WANTED.

20:24.633 --> 20:25.933
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.767
IT ACTUALLY WAS FUN.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.767
AND WE DIDN'T USE
OUR GHOST SHORTCUTS.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.800
- THAT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS,
BUT SWEET.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.767
AND DON'T WORRY,
THESE ARE HAPPY TEARS.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.667
COME IN FOR A GHOST HUG.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.933
- MY APOLOGY WAS BETTER
THAN YOURS.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.767
- YOU WISH.
MINE WAS WAY BETTER.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.400
- QUIET!

20:49.433 --> 20:52.433
ISN'T THIS NICE?

20:57.267 --> 21:00.400
- HIKE!
OH, HERE IT COMES!

21:00.433 --> 21:01.567
- OH!

21:01.600 --> 21:02.800
I CAUGHT IT!

21:02.833 --> 21:07.433
CHECK OUT MY END ZONE DANCE.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.467
- WE'RE BACK!

21:10.500 --> 21:12.733
- BEST NIGHT EVER!

21:12.767 --> 21:15.633
- I'M GLAD YOU GUYS FINALLY
STOPPED SCREAMING AT RAY

21:15.667 --> 21:17.400
AND INVITED HIM
TO THE CONCERT.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.467
- YEAH, HOPEFULLY
IT MADE UP

21:19.500 --> 21:20.733
FOR HOW HORRIBLY
WE TREATED HIM.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.300
- IT SURE DID.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.333
TURNS OUT
THE THREE CHADS WERE AWESOME.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.933
WHEN POUTY CHAD
SANG THAT BALLAD

21:26.967 --> 21:28.433
ABOUT HIS PET BIRD...

21:28.467 --> 21:33.433
"OH, OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH.

21:33.467 --> 21:36.733
GOOD-BYE, LITTLE BUDDY."

21:36.767 --> 21:38.467
- AND YOU KNOW,

21:38.500 --> 21:40.067
IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY FUN
DOING SOMETHING

21:40.067 --> 21:41.233
WITH MY LITTLE SIS.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.600
- YEAH.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.600
- WELL, THIS TURNED OUT
PRETTY GOOD.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.367
MAYBE WE SHOULD SWITCH KIDS
MORE OFTEN.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.567
WHAT YOU GOT?
WHAT YOU GOT?

21:48.600 --> 21:51.200
- HERE COMES THE PAIN.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.367
- BAD MOVE, LITTLE MAN!

21:54.800 --> 21:57.300
- FRANKIE, IT'S MY PHONE!

21:57.333 --> 21:59.167
I NEED TO CALL EMMA AND TELL HER
ABOUT THE CONCERT.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.067
- I NEED TO CALL NINA!

22:03.067 --> 22:06.667
- ACTUALLY, I'M GOOD.
- ME TOO.
