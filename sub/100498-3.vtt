WEBVTT

03:41.512 --> 03:42.347
Okay.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.193
Can I talk?

04:38.653 --> 04:40.947
I-- I'll talk.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.909
I have a feeling I know what this is about.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.079
Just to get the ball rolling, heh,

04:48.162 --> 04:53.042
please keep in mind that whatever happened
between Mr. Varga and myself,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.169
I'm hoping it's just water under the bridge.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.422
Because after all was said and done,

04:57.505 --> 04:59.340
you did walk out a free man.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.176
I mean, you weren't even in custody
for a full day.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.347
And I admit it was a tad bumpy getting there,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.850
but the path to justice is rarely smooth.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.438
So I'm hoping that, in the end, you know,
the final result speaks for itself.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.236
You had business with my cousin, Tuco.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.489
Tuco?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.870
Oh, sure, sure, yeah.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.414
And I see the family resemblance.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.750
Your cousin makes quite an impression.

05:33.833 --> 05:40.548
You know, he has a huge heart, and a--
A serious passion for justice.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.967
He's got a temper, huh?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.135
SAUL:
I hadn't noticed.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.096
Uh, ahem, how is your lovely <i>abuelita?</i>

05:53.019 --> 05:54.979
You know, Tuco told me about you.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.483
You're the guy with the mouth.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.610
Yeah.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.031
Those guys at the house...

06:06.115 --> 06:07.825
what'd they call her?

06:07.909 --> 06:08.910
Biznatch.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.122
Biznatch, yeah.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.040
Right.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.878
You know, the Tuco I know, pff,

06:18.961 --> 06:22.340
he would've skinned them alive
and let the buzzards eat their eyeballs.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.759
But there you were.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.470
You go, "Blah, blah, blah,"
and they walk out of there.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.263
I mean, it's amazing, really.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.140
They wheeled out, actually.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.479
So Ignacio and I...

06:38.106 --> 06:40.191
we got something you can do for us.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.610
Really?

06:42.693 --> 06:44.779
Yeah, we got a legal problem.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.866
A le-- A legal problem?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.828
All right, fantastic. I'm so...

06:51.911 --> 06:57.625
It's just that, for a minute there, I thought I was
gonna be swallowing condoms filled with heroin.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.044
No.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.170
Maybe later.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.133
NACHO:
We have a guy sitting in MDC.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.592
Picked up two days ago.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.303
-Picked up for what?
-Yeah, we'll get to that.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.808
We need our friend to tell the cops some things.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.726
Some important things.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.395
Important things. Gotcha.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.440
We want him to say exactly what we tell him.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.150
No more, no less.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.444
But the cops can't know it's coming from us.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.113
So we send you in there,

07:27.864 --> 07:29.949
you tell him how to do it,

07:30.032 --> 07:32.034
and they can't listen.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.745
Attorney-client confidentiality.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.414
Yeah, that.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.545
Uh, that's flattering.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.297
Uh...

07:46.841 --> 07:50.136
Can I offer this?

07:50.219 --> 07:53.848
Listen, I guarantee there are five of these
in MDC right now.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.226
You know, drop phones
inside someone's prison wallet,

07:57.310 --> 07:58.811
if you know what I'm talking about.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.857
Anyway, you talk directly to your guy,
cut out the middleman.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.568
It works better if you're in there with him.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.530
You're the guy for this.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.701
That's just-- That's...

08:14.785 --> 08:16.829
Terrific. That's the only word for it.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.372
Um...

08:20.333 --> 08:25.379
In good conscience, I think I have to warn you
that my rates have gone up,

08:25.463 --> 08:27.757
so going this way could be expensive.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.512
Like how expensive?

08:32.595 --> 08:35.681
Expensive. It's...

08:35.765 --> 08:37.975
-I mean...
-Yeah?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.393
Yeah. Um--

08:39.477 --> 08:41.896
Oh, gee, well, it's a full day of my time

08:41.979 --> 08:47.610
and prep work, transportation, rush fees. Um...

08:47.693 --> 08:48.528
Do the math,

08:48.611 --> 08:54.867
it's like, 7000, eight-- 900, uh,

08:54.951 --> 08:57.620
25 dollars.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.914
Yeah. Mm-hm.

08:59.997 --> 09:00.831
Yeah.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.837
Seven thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.716
It's the going rate, so...

09:15.680 --> 09:16.514
Sure.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.697
For your trouble, let's make it 8.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.269
-And I'll get you a cab.

That's all I'm saying.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.147
I'm trying to holla at her.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.150
-Mm.
-Check this fool out.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.904
All right, y'all, let's play.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.741
Hey, gramps, where you going?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.910
Yo, got 20 bucks you could lend me?

12:27.705 --> 12:30.124
Ah... Don't be scared.

-You'll let old cue ball talk to you like that?

12:43.304 --> 12:44.638
Hold up, gramps.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.026
So?

13:36.899 --> 13:37.733
Hey.

Hey.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.625
You done?

13:54.708 --> 13:55.960
Just about.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.506
Thanks.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.395
Everything good?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.521
Yeah.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.817
I'm sort of celebrating, actually.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.360
Celebrating what?

14:21.443 --> 14:26.365
I just realized I have all pro bono clients
tomorrow, all day.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.783
No Mesa Verde.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.120
Well, all right.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.831
-To justice.
-Yeah.

14:41.046 --> 14:41.964
What about you?

14:43.465 --> 14:44.341
Well...

14:46.635 --> 14:47.761
I met...

14:49.763 --> 14:52.349
some interesting people.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.977
And had a few...

14:56.562 --> 14:57.980
ups and downs.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.442
But you know what?

15:01.525 --> 15:06.280
Financially speaking,
Saul Goodman just had his best day yet.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.990
Ka-ching.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.702
Huh.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.585
Good for Saul.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.469
I'd better prep for tomorrow.

Right. Go get them, tiger.

What are you doing?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.429
I have to take it apart to clean it.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.696
Hey.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.740
Hey. Leave this alone.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.325
Leave it alone.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.622
Check this out.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.347
Did you order food?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.016
Mm-mm.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.741
Who is this?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.291
Is everything okay?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.792
Yes. Of course.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.877
Can I come in?

17:26.170 --> 17:27.755
Um...

17:27.838 --> 17:29.339
It's okay?

17:30.424 --> 17:31.675
It's fine.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.606
Hi.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.401
Amber, this is my father.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.157
Nice to meet you.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.617
Oh, yeah, me too.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.537
Um, excuse me.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.607
Can I get you anything?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.152
Want a coffee?

18:32.236 --> 18:33.112
No.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.660
So big.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.205
And new.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.482
How are you, Papa?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.817
Hmm.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.905
Gutierrez made me an offer.
He wants to buy the shop.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.741
Really?

19:21.493 --> 19:23.662
Don't tell me.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.831
Does he want to turn it into another tire shop?

19:27.666 --> 19:28.500
No.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.128
He wants to keep it as is.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.756
But...

19:35.966 --> 19:38.093
he offered more than it's worth

19:38.177 --> 19:40.470
even with the land.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.393
What are you going to do?

19:52.858 --> 19:56.111
I always thought I was
keeping the shop for you.

20:02.618 --> 20:06.747
Are you going to work 11 hours a day

20:06.830 --> 20:08.040
for the rest of your life?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.879
What do you think?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.174
It sounds like a good deal.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.969
Could be...

20:22.429 --> 20:23.931
your chance to retire.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.190
This is you, isn't it?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.903
I don't know what you mean.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.863
You put Gutierrez up to this.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.283
This is your money he's offering me.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.329
Papa, no.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.247
No.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.374
This is you trying to get me to leave town.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.376
You want to run.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
You want me to run too.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.297
Deny it.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.716
Tell me I'm wrong.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.762
Look me in the eyes.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.894
I've told you what you should do.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.396
Give this up.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.814
Go to the police.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.649
Face what you've done.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.570
If you want to run, run.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.073
But me?

21:24.366 --> 21:26.702
No way, I will not run away.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.249
Nice to meet you, young lady.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.084
-Kim, something's come up with Tucumcari.
-Not now, Stef.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.503
-I wouldn't bother you, but--
-I asked you to handle it.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.215
-We are, but there's--
-Stef, this is not the time, all right?

22:29.473 --> 22:31.349
Okay.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.768
Okay.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.729
Miss Wexler, I've reviewed
your motion to dismiss

22:35.812 --> 22:38.648
and the state's one-page response.

22:39.649 --> 22:43.070
Your argument is well-reasoned.
However, I'm denying the motion.

22:43.153 --> 22:47.157
Your Honor, I'd like to remind you that this
was nothing more than a family dispute.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.117
-My client was--
-Yeah, I'll stop you there.

22:49.201 --> 22:53.663
This is not your client's first negative interaction
with the victim, which shows pattern of behavior.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.876
And as such, I still agree with the state
that this matter is worth the court's time.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.170
-Your Honor--
-Jury selection begins June 16th.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.258
I'm sorry this didn't go our way.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.678
Going in, we all knew getting the case dismissed
would be a long shot.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.764
The judge seemed kind of mad.

23:10.847 --> 23:14.976
Yeah, she can come off that way,
but she is actually very fair.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.605
So now, the prosecution will come back to us
with a more realistic plea bargain,

23:18.688 --> 23:22.150
but if we don't like what they have to offer,
I believe we'll win at trial.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.819
What does that mean?

23:23.902 --> 23:27.364
We'll have a chance to explain what happened,
in front of a jury of regular people.

23:27.447 --> 23:31.660
Look, you were trying to do a good thing,
and I think they'll see that.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.495
Just keep the faith, okay?

23:33.578 --> 23:35.914
MARISSA: Okay.
-I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.875
It's Rich. This is the second time he's called.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.294
Hey, Rich.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.840
RICH: <i>I'm confused. I thought you'd be</i>
<i>on your way to Tucumcari by now.</i>

23:44.923 --> 23:47.008
-Uh, Rich--
<i>-I just got off with Kevin Wachtell.</i>

23:47.092 --> 23:49.427
He wants you there now
to straighten this out, hands on.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.139
Well, I'm flattered, but my clients need me.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.099
I have a full day of appearances here.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.686
<i>Well, all I can tell you,</i>
<i>he's called twice in 40 minutes.</i>

23:57.769 --> 23:59.855
I promise you, Tucumcari's under control.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.731
The associates are more than capable.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.485
<i>Help me understand.</i>
<i>It's not like you're in the middle of a murder trial.</i>

24:05.569 --> 24:07.612
Rich, this is just Kevin being Kevin.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.574
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I respect your devotion to your pro bono clients,</i>

24:10.657 --> 24:13.201
but Mesa Verde keeps the lights on.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.411
Can we agree on that?

24:17.372 --> 24:18.707
Of course.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.167
<i>We've all been here.</i>

24:20.250 --> 24:23.128
<i>Once in a while, you have to give</i>
<i>a little to get a little, you know?</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:25.338
Mm-hm.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.048
Viola's already briefed Stef and Gary.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.968
They'll take your afternoon cases
and get continuances if necessary,

24:30.051 --> 24:32.053
so get yourself down there, stat.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.933
All right. I'm on my way.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.540
-Who the hell are you?
-Shh.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.299
Now, thank you, officer.
We'll let you know when we're done.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.806
Sit.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.310
Who are you?

25:28.985 --> 25:30.862
I'm your new lawyer.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.533
-I didn't call no lawyer.
-No, you didn't.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.660
Lalo did.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.831
I didn't say anything to no one.
I kept my mouth shut.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.668
I know, I know. Don't worry, kid.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.711
I'm nothing but good news for you.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.173
All right, we got a lot to go over here.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.468
How are you at memorization?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.399
HANK:
Excuse me.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.819
Hey, Myrna. How's the boy?

26:52.902 --> 26:56.197
MYRNA: He's good, Hank.
-He's, what, third base?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.866
-Catcher.
-Catcher. Tsk.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.119
-Hey, Steve.
-Looking good, Myrna.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.291
Let me ask you something.

27:06.374 --> 27:10.003
Does Blanca throw stuff out
on the exact day it expires?

27:10.086 --> 27:11.629
Like what?

27:11.713 --> 27:15.008
Anything. Milk, ketchup, soy sauce.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.552
As the clock literally strikes midnight,

27:17.635 --> 27:21.514
Marie hands me a full Hefty bag
and pushes me out to the trash cans.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.142
I mean, you know, most of it's still good.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.435
What the hell?

27:25.518 --> 27:27.979
Food banks don't take expired food.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.190
Oh, thanks for that, Ann Landers.

27:30.273 --> 27:34.527
Once I found an old can of vanilla frosting.
I ate that. I'm still here.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.489
You what?

27:37.572 --> 27:41.326
Hey, we were talking about expired food.
I thought it was relevant.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.165
Let's get this circle jerk over with.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.358
Alrighty.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.360
Domingo Molina.

28:16.820 --> 28:21.449
Picked up for possession
of half ounce of street grade gak.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.451
GOMEZ:
That's dealing weight.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.454
Keeps his mouth shut
for the first two nights he's in here,

28:26.538 --> 28:30.583
and now has an epiphany and wants to talk.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.378
Okay.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.339
Wow me.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.467
Make my tiny eyes grow wide with delight.

28:42.804 --> 28:46.182
What if I know
where there's half a million in drug money?

28:46.266 --> 28:47.726
What if?

28:48.601 --> 28:50.603
What if?

28:51.938 --> 28:55.567
If that's true, things could go well for you.

28:55.650 --> 28:59.654
My partner's right.
That kind of information can lead to good things.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.950
Give me the deets.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.495
Where the drugs come from,
who the money goes to,

29:07.579 --> 29:11.040
the name of your boss and who you report to.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.585
For starters.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.797
Okay.

29:22.093 --> 29:25.138
The dealers kick up the cash, right?

29:25.221 --> 29:30.226
But they don't go face to face with the big guys,
so they leave it in different spots.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.103
-Dead drops?
-Yeah.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.857
Sounds like a big operation.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.109
SAUL:
Hello! Hey.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.652
Silence.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.821
Were you talking to them?

29:41.905 --> 29:44.949
Were you talking to my client
without his lawyer present?

29:46.826 --> 29:47.702
And you are?

29:47.786 --> 29:50.663
Saul Goodman. I'm Mr. Molina's attorney.

29:50.747 --> 29:54.042
And you're in violation
of his constitutional rights.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.336
Saul. It's all good, man.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.465
-Really? Come on. That's your name?
-Listen, officer--

30:00.548 --> 30:02.967
Uh, special agent.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.427
Oh, the DEA?

30:04.511 --> 30:06.930
Oh, I see, okay. The feds.

30:07.013 --> 30:10.266
Well, what, they don't teach the Constitution
at Quantico these days?

30:10.350 --> 30:11.559
Yeah. Quantico is FBI.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.271
I don't care.
DEA, FBI, Department of Sanitation.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.400
It's time for you two gentlemen to vacate
the premises. There's the door. Shoo, shoo.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.529
-Go away.
-Uh, your client waived his right to an attorney.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.405
Whoa, he most certainly did not.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.201
-Yeah, I did.
-Zip it, okay? Nobody's talking to you.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.913
-Uh, well, he wants to talk to us.
-He-- He's confused, okay?

30:31.996 --> 30:34.415
-He was dropped on his head as a child.
-I wanna talk.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.917
-No, you don't!
-Yeah, I do.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.669
Sounds like he does. Heh.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.922
You just-- One-- One moment.
Come-- Come here.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.841
Just come here.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.847
Do you know--?
And we just discussed this, okay?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.181
You don't talk to...

30:52.267 --> 30:53.518
I'm doing my job.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.562
Which is protecting you from you!

30:55.645 --> 30:59.107
-I'm talking whether you like it or not.
-You're killing me here, man.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.528
Okay, look.

31:04.904 --> 31:09.701
My client is making
what I believe to be a grave error.

31:09.784 --> 31:13.121
Also showing a heartbreaking
lack of faith in his attorney.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.832
And I'm not gonna lie, it hurts.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.256
He insists on dealing, so let's talk turkey.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.761
You know what?

31:28.845 --> 31:30.597
We're not interested.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.809
I feel like my chain is being jerked,
and not in a good way, if you know what I'm saying.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.437
-There's no half mil. Never was.
-Yep.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.106
-Bullshit. I called it, Gomey, remember?
-You did.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.941
-Hold on.
HANK: I'm gonna blow this popsicle--

31:42.025 --> 31:43.693
SAUL: Wait a second.
-Have a great afternoon.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.904
-Hold up, guys, one second.
HANK: Hey, have a good day.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.697
-We're done in here.
SAUL: Guys, um...

31:49.324 --> 31:50.909
What if we say it's contingent?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.916
Contingent?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.334
On what?

31:59.417 --> 32:00.460
SAUL:
Results.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.128
Mr. Molina will stay in custody

32:02.211 --> 32:06.966
while you verify his very specific,
limited information.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.928
And what if what he tells us doesn't pan out?

32:10.011 --> 32:13.723
Oh, well, then he just stays here.
I mean, we're back where we started.

32:13.806 --> 32:17.518
-But if his information leads to something--
-Arrests.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.895
What?

32:19.562 --> 32:23.858
If his information leads to arrests.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.490
Well, yeah.

32:30.573 --> 32:35.536
Well, if his information leads to arrests,
then the charges go away.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.208
Okay? Now, how can you say no to that?
That is a win-win for you guys.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.343
Give us another minute.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.260
SAUL:
Good.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.808
Okay, Domingo.

32:56.891 --> 32:57.934
Start talking.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.269
Go ahead.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.024
Like I said, the dealers kick up the cash.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.486
I don't know who picks it up.

33:08.569 --> 33:11.614
All I know is that there are
these three dead drops on Thursday nights--

33:11.698 --> 33:12.991
-Hold on.
-What-- What?

33:13.074 --> 33:15.451
SAUL:
Look, I know how this goes, all right?

33:15.535 --> 33:18.329
My guy talks to you,
you squeeze him out like a sponge,

33:18.413 --> 33:20.623
then you dump him back on the street.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.168
Word gets out that he's a fink,
he ends up bleeding out at his mother's house.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.921
-What?
-No. It's not gonna happen, okay?

33:27.005 --> 33:31.384
Do you hear what I'm saying? My client
is not leaving here with a target on his back.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.856
Fine. We'll take care of him.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.235
Assuming this isn't one big jag-off.

33:49.318 --> 33:54.741
It'll look like he got out
because his lawyer's a genius.

33:54.824 --> 33:58.619
Okay. And he's--
He's not just anyone's CI, either, all right?

33:58.703 --> 34:01.456
You don't pass him around
like a venereal disease.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.499
He's your personal CI.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.503
So he gets picked up, he calls me, I call you,
gets taken care of.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.338
No questions asked.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.300
Okay.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.635
But it's contingent.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.305
-Sure.
-And this better be worth it.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.726
Yeah.

34:21.809 --> 34:22.643
Okay.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.899
So, like I said,
there are these three dead drops.

34:27.982 --> 34:31.986
The first one's under a bridge
up by Chavez Road, over Hillsdale Street.

34:32.070 --> 34:37.158
The second one's in an empty rail yard
off Waldren in a train shed. There's a--

34:48.294 --> 34:49.337
PAIGE:
Oh, thank God.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.092
Is he home?

34:54.175 --> 34:56.552
Yeah, he never seems to leave.

34:56.636 --> 35:01.140
-A word of warning, he's very unpleasant.
-Got it.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.030
Mr. Acker, I think you're home!

35:18.574 --> 35:21.369
My name is Kim Wexler,
and I'd really like to talk to you!

35:34.590 --> 35:36.759
Mr. Acker, hello.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.344
Thanks for speaking with me.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.804
There's been a misunderstanding,

35:39.887 --> 35:42.849
and it's in everyone's best interest
if we straighten it out.

35:42.932 --> 35:46.018
-May I come in?
-Stay right where you're at.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.204
Okay.

36:12.587 --> 36:16.215
As I understand it, you and your family
have been here since 1974.

36:17.550 --> 36:21.846
You built this lovely house,
but you never actually owned the land it was on.

36:21.929 --> 36:25.308
It was leased to you by a local company,
Deerview Investment Properties.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.476
For a hundred years.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.478
I got 70 left.

36:29.562 --> 36:35.526
That's correct. However, and I know
this may be difficult to wrap your head around,

36:35.610 --> 36:39.655
your lease stipulates that the property owner
can buy you out at any time

36:39.739 --> 36:42.700
for fair market value plus $5000.

36:42.783 --> 36:47.205
I know $5000 isn't nearly as much
as it used to be back in 1974, and--

36:47.288 --> 36:49.081
And we do understand how...

36:50.374 --> 36:52.627
inconvenient this must be.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.961
So, as a gesture of goodwill,

36:54.045 --> 36:58.257
Mesa Verde has just increased
your buy-out to $18,000.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.801
Eighteen thousand dollars?

37:00.885 --> 37:01.719
That's right.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.348
Well, nobody's ever explained it to me
like that before.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.811
Eighteen thousand dollars, that's a lot of money.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.943
I bet you, with that, I could buy
a big old mansion and a swimming pool.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.695
-Mr. Acker, we know it's not enough--
-Do me a favor, will you?

37:19.779 --> 37:23.574
I'm gonna spread my legs out like this,

37:23.658 --> 37:27.870
and just to finish it off,
why don't you give me a swift kick in the balls?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.497
That's not necessary.

37:29.580 --> 37:34.210
You people are all the same.
You're soulless money grubbers.

37:34.293 --> 37:37.380
Please, Mr. Acker, how about
we just discuss this, civil?

37:37.463 --> 37:40.841
Adverse possession means this is my land.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.636
You made that argument in court,
and the judge ruled against you.

37:43.719 --> 37:47.807
Yeah, and nobody could change my mind,
so they sent you out.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.017
You're the big gun,

37:50.101 --> 37:52.311
with a ponytail.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.275
Oh, you're just like all the rest of them,

37:57.358 --> 38:00.611
coming out here in your fancy suit,

38:00.695 --> 38:07.702
bring your minions with you,
driving them black, shiny German cars.

38:09.036 --> 38:13.457
And you think you can talk to me
like I'm brain damaged?

38:13.541 --> 38:15.668
N, O.

38:15.751 --> 38:16.585
No!

38:18.546 --> 38:22.675
That big bank
thinks it's gonna build a call center.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.011
So...

38:26.595 --> 38:31.517
you go around throwing people
out of their homes.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.312
Well, not this house, sweetheart!

38:37.481 --> 38:38.316
All right.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.694
I can see you've made up your mind.

38:41.777 --> 38:44.238
-Have a good day.
-And I can see you.

38:46.115 --> 38:51.746
You're one of those people
that give a little money to charity every month,

38:51.829 --> 38:55.333
so you can make up
for all the bad that you've done.

38:55.416 --> 38:59.670
You go to a soup kitchen
once a year on Thanksgiving.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.882
That makes you feel
a whole lot better about yourself.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.469
Makes you feel like one of the best rich people.

39:09.430 --> 39:14.226
Oh, I don't know how in the world
you sleep at night.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.405
Listen to me.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.075
You do not get to make up your own rules.

39:30.451 --> 39:36.624
Put on your big boy pants and face reality.
No one is mistreating you here.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.417
We were trying to meet you halfway.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.920
Well, that's over.

39:41.003 --> 39:44.590
The $18,000, guess what? It's off the table.

39:44.673 --> 39:47.676
Tomorrow you come to your senses?
You'll get 10.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.429
And you know what happens after that?

39:50.513 --> 39:53.057
The sheriff comes out and kicks you out of here.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.351
And you get nothing.

39:55.434 --> 39:59.730
Why should you get to drag this out
for seven months while all of your neighbors,

39:59.814 --> 40:02.858
every single one of them, played by the rules?

40:02.942 --> 40:05.945
And do you--? Do you--?
Do you think you're special?

40:07.029 --> 40:09.865
A contract means something.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.202
It's the law, and it's enforceable.

40:13.285 --> 40:14.203
Deal with it.

40:20.876 --> 40:24.630
-That was amazing. Great job.
-I didn't solve anything.

40:24.713 --> 40:28.217
Mm. You ended it. That's what we needed.

41:09.341 --> 41:10.759
LALO:
Wahoo!

41:10.843 --> 41:12.678
You hear that?

41:12.761 --> 41:15.890
I replaced the carburetor.
She's running like a racehorse, man.

41:15.973 --> 41:21.061
-It's a fine vehicle. That's a thing of beauty.
-Yeah? What do you drive?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.146
An Esteem.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.857
A what?

41:24.940 --> 41:28.110
A Suzuki Esteem, it's an import.

41:29.111 --> 41:30.404
Huh.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.823
-So?
-Yeah, so it went just like you wanted.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.243
Assuming the dead drops are a real thing,
the feds are gonna be on them.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.954
-The feds?
-Yeah. DEA.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.874
There's a pair of them,
and they're into this with a vengeance.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.585
I mean, think feeding time in the lion cage.

41:44.668 --> 41:48.964
And, um, they're gunning for arrests.

41:49.798 --> 41:50.633
Okay.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.302
Oh, and...

41:54.303 --> 41:56.597
your guy is now a confidential informant.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.183
-What do you mean, like a rat?
-No, he's not a rat. No.

41:59.266 --> 42:02.645
I mean. Well, if he's a rat, he's your rat, so...

42:02.728 --> 42:06.232
Uh, put it this way,
you now have a hotline to the DEA.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.234
And not just now, anytime.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.694
So that's a good thing, right?

42:10.778 --> 42:15.407
But the deal is, at some point,
you might hear that Domingo is a snitch.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.160
You-- You gotta know he's not.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.622
And what do you care?

42:23.499 --> 42:26.126
Well, all due respect,
you're paying me, but he's my client.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.836
I'd like to keep him alive.

42:30.339 --> 42:33.175
This dude. Good idea.

42:34.885 --> 42:37.680
And one more thing. Um...

42:37.763 --> 42:40.391
You have to find a different attorney
for future endeavors,

42:40.474 --> 42:43.185
because my schedule is just very, very tight.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.648
You'll make time.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.900
Ah.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.625
Who exactly did I just set up?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.545
You don't wanna know.

43:09.628 --> 43:13.173
I mean, if there's gonna be blowback,
I don't want to be in the middle of it.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.634
It's not about what you want.

43:15.718 --> 43:16.760
When you're in...

43:18.429 --> 43:19.263
you're in.

43:56.925 --> 43:57.885
KIM:
And Martinez?

43:57.968 --> 44:00.179
STEF:
<i>We got a continuance.</i>

44:00.262 --> 44:01.972
Good. Davenport?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.933
<i>-The judge read your motion and dismissed.</i>
-Yes.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.935
<i>Oh, and I got a continuance on Russo.</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:10.481
-His hearing's scheduled for Thursday morning?
<i>-Yep. Viola put it in your calendar.</i>

44:10.564 --> 44:12.066
Good. What about Ingram?

44:12.149 --> 44:14.109
<i>He didn't show.</i>

44:14.193 --> 44:16.028
Did you call all three numbers?

44:16.111 --> 44:17.696
<i>I called the first one.</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:19.948
Call all three. The bottom number is his aunt.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.743
-She usually knows where he is.
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

44:22.826 --> 44:24.953
<i>-I got a continuance.</i>
-That's okay.

44:25.037 --> 44:30.668
Call his aunt and make sure he's all right,
and ask how I can get in touch before his hearing.

44:30.751 --> 44:33.087
If she doesn't,
call the Rescue Mission Shelter on 2nd.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.672
That's his backup.

44:34.755 --> 44:35.589
<i>Will do.</i>

44:37.925 --> 44:40.803
-All right. Good job, Stef.
<i>-Thanks, Kim.</i>

44:40.886 --> 44:43.013
<i>-Get home safe.</i>
-Yep. Have a good evening.

45:34.815 --> 45:35.983
KIM:
Mr. Acker?

45:37.317 --> 45:38.777
It's Kim Wexler again.

45:40.237 --> 45:41.864
I'd really like another word with you.

46:06.263 --> 46:07.473
Mr. Acker?

46:31.872 --> 46:33.123
Mr. Acker?

46:35.083 --> 46:38.128
I'm sorry, I-- I entered your property.

46:40.422 --> 46:42.132
I'd really like to talk to you.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.274
Hi.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.069
Can we start over?

47:03.695 --> 47:08.450
-Say what you came to say.
-I went to a real estate office.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.619
I found some houses I think you might like.

47:12.788 --> 47:16.041
There are some really nice options
in your price range.

47:20.879 --> 47:22.506
This one's on half an acre.

47:24.800 --> 47:31.515
And, uh, this one is older,
but it has a really good view.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.476
And the neighborhood's pretty.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.106
I know moving's a big deal.

47:39.189 --> 47:42.901
I'd like to help you out with that myself,
if that's all right with you.

47:42.985 --> 47:46.613
I can take off any day this week,
and I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

47:50.534 --> 47:53.829
Uh, oh. This one has three bedrooms.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.296
I know you don't wanna move,
but whatever house you choose will be yours.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.423
You'll own it, and the land, forever.

48:16.893 --> 48:19.980
You're right. I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through.

48:20.981 --> 48:23.650
I've never owned a house.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.277
My family never owned one, either.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.071
We never owned anything.

48:29.615 --> 48:32.451
When I was little, my mother
used to shake me awake in the night,

48:32.534 --> 48:34.536
yelling it was time to go.

48:35.912 --> 48:38.290
She was always one step ahead of the landlord.

48:40.083 --> 48:46.465
I'd throw my things in a cardboard box
and run outside in my pajamas and bare feet.

48:47.841 --> 48:48.842
Sometimes...

48:50.510 --> 48:51.720
it was so cold...

48:54.139 --> 48:55.807
my to-- My toes turned blue.

49:06.568 --> 49:09.613
If we'd had a house,
I never would've wanted to leave.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.330
You'll say anything...

49:19.873 --> 49:22.167
to get what you want, won't you?

50:11.675 --> 50:12.968
When was this?

50:13.051 --> 50:14.678
Today.

50:14.761 --> 50:17.389
Do you have the agents' names?

50:17.472 --> 50:18.807
The lawyer's got them.

50:24.980 --> 50:25.939
What are you doing?

50:27.232 --> 50:29.317
Shutting it down.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.235
Put it away.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.117
You wanna leave the money for the feds?

50:38.118 --> 50:39.286
NACHO:
Um...

50:40.328 --> 50:42.831
If there's no money in those dead drops...

50:44.583 --> 50:47.127
Lalo will know someone talked.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.766
The dead drops remain.
