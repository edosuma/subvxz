WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:11.212
Fisher:
We've had some great team
meetings over the years, man,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
some great ones.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.483
This is one that, um...

00:15.516 --> 00:18.152
you're probably
gonna remember...

00:20.121 --> 00:24.392
because I'm no longer
your head coach.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.628
This business is based
on wins and losses.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.530
And...

00:29.563 --> 00:31.799
they decided to make a change.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.534
So...

00:33.567 --> 00:36.604
It was tough. It was...

00:36.637 --> 00:38.706
There was a lot of emotion
in there, like...

00:38.739 --> 00:40.308
You know, I was even crying.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.076
I couldn't tell you
the last time I cried,

00:42.110 --> 00:45.379
you know, before then.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.482
Hayes:
It made it a little bit deeper
than just football for me.

00:48.516 --> 00:55.456
He helped change the way my life
is, you know, my livelihood.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.725
The way now I can
provide for my family.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.796
Donald:
You definitely down about it.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.365
You know, that's the guy
that drafted you,

01:04.398 --> 01:05.733
gave you opportunity to be

01:05.766 --> 01:07.201
in this league
and be in this seat today.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.802
But at the same time,

01:08.836 --> 01:11.272
I understand the business
part of things, you know.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.507
You got to win.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.676
Goff: We were in a bad spot.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.311
Offensively, defensively,
special teams --

01:17.345 --> 01:20.181
the whole thing
was not doing well, and...

01:20.214 --> 01:21.515
I don't think anybody
ever thought

01:21.549 --> 01:23.217
it would ever happen
during the season,

01:23.251 --> 01:26.887
not -- especially not on
a short week versus Seattle.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.792
And that's when you realize
that...just got real, honestly.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.862
**

01:51.579 --> 01:54.715
Man: If you're just tuning in,
the Rams just fired Jeff Fisher.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.450
Reports are trickling in.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.920
It appears they are
going to appoint

01:59.953 --> 02:02.890
the special teams coach
to be the head coach,

02:02.923 --> 02:05.593
and Jeff Fisher is out.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.296
[ Conversing indistinctly ]

02:59.913 --> 03:01.515
Yeah.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.389
Okay.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.926
Damn, it's just...

03:12.960 --> 03:15.396
I know it's a lot.
You know, I do.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.964
The biggest thing is...

03:41.289 --> 03:42.456
-Okay.
-All right.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.825
Yeah.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.860
Thank you.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.896
Fassel:
It will be a 24-hour period

03:48.929 --> 03:51.732
I'll definitely never forget.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.303
We played Atlanta at home
on that Sunday,

03:55.336 --> 03:56.704
and I went home
for about an hour

03:56.737 --> 03:58.406
after the game
to kiss my kids good night,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.774
and then I drove back up here
to the office.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.010
And didn't sleep,
worked through the whole night

04:03.043 --> 04:05.679
'cause we played
at Seattle Thursday.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.980
So it was a short week for us.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.782
We were gonna be
on the road on Wednesday,

04:08.816 --> 04:11.819
so I was awake the whole night.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.987
And at about 11:00, you know,

04:14.021 --> 04:17.358
we were all informed that
Coach Fisher had been let go.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.561
And soon after that,
we're on the practice field.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.497
So it all came really fast.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.633
All right, "Bones."

04:25.666 --> 04:27.034
Here we go.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.870
Here you go.
I love you, Coach Mac.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.805
Bonesy, I love you,
too, brother.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.643
Man.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.345
You know I'm --
you know I'm here to help you.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.614
I know.
Always been.

04:40.648 --> 04:44.017
Hamm: In-season firings
are harsh, but not unheard of.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.887
The Rams need a spark

04:46.920 --> 04:49.690
and hope John Fassel
can provide it.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.392
The man they call Bones

04:51.425 --> 04:55.062
is no stranger to the changing
fortunes of the NFL.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.530
Here we go, "D."

04:56.564 --> 04:58.065
He grew up
on the NFL sidelines

04:58.098 --> 04:59.933
with his father, Jim Fassel,

04:59.967 --> 05:04.538
head coach of the Giants
from 1997 to 2003.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.675
Fassel: I was fortunate to
grow up in a football house.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.944
It helped give me a really
good perspective on change,

05:10.978 --> 05:13.347
knowing that it's coming.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.449
You really don't know when.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.051
You know, I spent a lot of years
in the locker room.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.620
You know, I was standing
on his sideline,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.021
and I'd hold the red flag.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.556
Hey, challenge it!
Challenge it, challenge it,

05:22.590 --> 05:23.891
challenge it,
challenge it!

05:23.924 --> 05:26.360
Ball boy, practice fields.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.629
You know, hearing my dad
got fired on the radio

05:28.662 --> 05:30.664
before I was told by my mom.

05:30.698 --> 05:35.969
So all of that stuff just
prepares you for the unexpected.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.971
I think it's
helped me understand

05:38.005 --> 05:40.140
building relationships
with players,

05:40.173 --> 05:42.876
because that's really
the most important thing.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.144
Hamm: Fassel is a young coach

05:44.177 --> 05:46.514
who relates well
to a young team.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.882
But time isn't on his side.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.552
The Rams play on
Thursday night this week,

05:51.585 --> 05:54.588
giving them just three days
to prepare.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.457
There's much to be done.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.693
So Fassel is relying
on the old soul of the staff --

05:59.727 --> 06:03.163
Dave McGinnis,
a former head coach himself.

06:03.196 --> 06:08.869
I mean, I know this is huge
on top of you right now, but...

06:08.902 --> 06:10.538
as I said, when I took
that thing over

06:10.571 --> 06:11.905
in Arizona
on an interim basis,

06:11.939 --> 06:14.408
Jeff Fisher is the first guy
I called.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.444
And he spent two hours
with me on the phone.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.945
We just went through
a checklist of things,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.614
just like
your clock management.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.583
Kind of keep your eye
on both sides of it.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.485
Don't try to get
outside of yourself.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.454
You'll get the headset
where you can switch over.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.955
They got to bring you up
and talk to you

06:27.988 --> 06:29.156
about these
personnel moves.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.158
Your time-outs.
Am I gonna punt?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.660
The challenges.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.161
-Yeah.
-Going for it on fourth down --

06:34.194 --> 06:38.065
all this stuff
is gonna come into it.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.434
And here's the other thing,
Bones, don't try to learn it

06:40.468 --> 06:42.169
all at once, either,
'cause you can't.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.904
Don't clutter yourself up.
-Okay.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.874
You know what I'm saying?
Don't.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.877
Don't do that.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.179
Hey, close right,
close five.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.414
Four on, stay...

06:59.520 --> 07:03.190
You love ball,
you love Coach Fish.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.558
That's all we really need
to get us through

07:04.592 --> 07:05.926
these next three weeks.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.561
All right, love ball,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.530
we love the man
who just walked out the door

07:09.563 --> 07:11.532
who gave us all
a hell of an opportunity.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.634
That's all we need
for the next three weeks.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.102
Okay?
-Yes, sir.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.604
I'll break this one down.
Bring it in.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.138
-Let's do it, man.
-Let's go, man.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.473
Let's go.
"Team" on three.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.841
One, two, three!

07:20.874 --> 07:22.676
Together: Team!

07:22.710 --> 07:25.746
**

07:51.271 --> 07:53.106
Want me to hold it up?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.108
It's good.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.610
Hey, everybody.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.112
It's been a long night.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.648
Been a long day.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.752
A lot's happened
in a little amount of time.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.254
You know, emotional.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.123
And got a couple days
before our next game.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.892
So...

08:11.925 --> 08:15.796
it will be an interesting
couple of days and...

08:15.829 --> 08:17.097
love Coach Fisher.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.899
Respect the heck
out of Coach Fisher.

08:18.932 --> 08:23.203
Gave me a great opportunity
to come coach on his staff.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.738
And I'm gonna try to do my best

08:24.772 --> 08:27.074
to make him proud
over the next three weeks.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.076
What has your father told you,
if anything,

08:29.109 --> 08:31.144
since you've accepted
this position?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.546
I actually haven't
talked to him.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.114
-Really?
-I know it's horrible,

08:34.147 --> 08:37.250
and I'll call you
in a little bit, Dad, I promise.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.853
Man: Are you surprised
that they came to you?

08:39.887 --> 08:43.791
Yeah.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.093
Why are you surprised
they came to you?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.761
You know, I...

08:47.795 --> 08:50.931
I'm in the dungeon,
working my special teams

08:50.964 --> 08:53.000
day and night,
that's all I do.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.570
You know, I don't make
the decisions that Coach Fisher

08:56.604 --> 09:00.641
or even, you know, sometimes
the O-coordinators have to make.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.210
And, you know,
whether I'm ready for it or not,

09:03.243 --> 09:04.812
I'm gonna kick ass and --

09:04.845 --> 09:06.279
I don't know
if I'm allowed to say that.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.582
You already have.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.984
I say it in the meetings a lot,
and I don't curse,

09:11.018 --> 09:14.154
but I think that's one that
I could probably get away with.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.357
I think Coach Fassel carries
tremendous respect

09:17.390 --> 09:18.959
from our players.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.094
He carries tremendous respect
from our coaches.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.896
He'll bring tremendous energy.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.865
And this is about getting
the most out of our group

09:24.898 --> 09:26.900
for the last few games.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.737
I think, collectively,
we all felt that this was

09:29.770 --> 09:32.740
the best chance to move forward,

09:32.773 --> 09:36.209
to finish the season
with some direction and hope,

09:36.243 --> 09:41.114
and to begin the process
of building for 2017.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.617
Goff: This is just a little bit
of a distraction,

09:43.651 --> 09:45.018
of course, that we're gonna
have to deal with.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.754
It was gonna be hard
on a short week already,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
and now this is another thing

09:48.321 --> 09:49.890
we're gonna have to deal
with a little bit.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.258
And today, like I said,
today was hard.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.260
It wasn't easy.
It was a tough day.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.029
It was weird.
I mean, it was...

09:56.063 --> 09:57.665
it was a tough feeling
around the facility,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.300
and I can't stress enough how...

10:00.333 --> 10:01.935
how much it hurts,
but, you know,

10:01.969 --> 10:05.005
we need to find a way
to move on and...

10:05.038 --> 10:06.339
find a way to beat Seattle
in a couple days,

10:06.373 --> 10:09.009
and that's what we need to do.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.784
Hamm: It's been 24 hours
since Jeff Fisher was fired.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.052
In two days,
the Rams will be in Seattle,

10:19.086 --> 10:22.656
hoping to finish off
a season sweep of the Seahawks.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.725
Groh: I'm excited
about this challenge.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.194
I can't wait to go up there
and play against the Seahawks.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.798
Right, you know,
the Legion of...Boom.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.267
I can't wait.
I can't wait.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.936
And...

10:35.969 --> 10:38.238
is it gonna be on TV?
Yeah.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.074
And everybody wants to see
how we're gonna respond.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.810
Everybody wants to see
what we're made of.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.978
We got a chance to show them.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.714
Hey, we're all hurting.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.348
A lot of different --
both physically and mentally.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.250
Right, mind over matter.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.352
What the mind believes,
the body will achieve.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.688
We've got to get our mind right
right now.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.956
This is mental.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.458
Thursday night games are mental.

10:58.491 --> 11:02.295
You believe it, right, your
body's gonna start believing it.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.765
Get the mind right.
Proven how...

11:04.798 --> 11:06.166
Hamm: Thursday night games
are difficult

11:06.199 --> 11:08.235
in the best of circumstances.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.038
The quick turnaround
is draining.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.307
Less sleep, less preparation,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.243
less recovery...

11:16.276 --> 11:18.879
and no time to dwell
on the obstacles.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.882
Brian, I need like a...
a little rub down.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.984
-Icy Hot compress?
-No, no, no.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.418
I need like, just manual.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.055
Oh.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.724
Whole thing.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.929
Do it a little harder.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.430
There you go.
-Keep it warm.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.032
Your arm
bothering you?

Keep grinding.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.917
Remember, have something
you fight for, all right?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.019
Hamm: The rest of the game

20:53.052 --> 20:55.422
looks a lot like
the rest of the season...

20:55.455 --> 20:58.791
some good moments,
but not nearly enough.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.662
Goff suffers more growing pains.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.467

to the Legion of Boom.

-Oh, gets slammed out of bounds

21:12.605 --> 21:15.908
at the 3 by Richard Sherman.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.578
Collinsworth: Richard Sherman
never broke stride,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.580
and Goff thought
he was gonna sneak in

21:20.613 --> 21:23.683
and took
an unbelievable shot.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.318
The guys upstairs said

21:25.352 --> 21:26.819
they wanted to take
a look at the quarterback.

-Oh, I got ya.
-You know what I mean?

21:28.688 --> 21:30.623
Michaels: So Goff,
who doesn't want

21:30.657 --> 21:33.993
to come out of the game,
will have to.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.462
What you got, bud?

Hamm: A painful week ends
with another loss

21:37.564 --> 21:39.031
and a spate of injuries.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.700
Hang tough, bro.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.934

We'll get X-rays on it.

played hard as hell.

Oh, they did.

-They played hard for him.
-Yeah.

-They did.
-I will. Thanks, Steve.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.831
Fassel: A first time for me,

22:11.864 --> 22:13.966
so I probably don't have a lot
of pearls of wisdom for you.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.902
But, you know,
I had a hell of a time,

22:15.935 --> 22:17.904
it was a hell of an experience.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.106
I do know that we got
two weeks left,

22:20.139 --> 22:21.708
and after that, obviously,

22:21.741 --> 22:23.109
a lot of things
are gonna change.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.645
So I'm proud of you out there.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.514
We're gonna keep fighting.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.016
We're gonna go back to work.
We're gonna stay together.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.486
We're gonna grind to the finish
because that's just what we do.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.088
All right. All good.
Let's do it, man.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.057
Man: What was the experience
like for you as a head coach

22:38.090 --> 22:40.693
of just being there
and leading a team?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.562
Yeah, thanks for asking.
It was...

22:42.595 --> 22:45.097
it was pretty crazy.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.934
Obviously, you know,
losing was disappointing,

22:47.967 --> 22:50.036
but standing out in the stadium

22:50.069 --> 22:52.772
and, you know,
my dad was on the sideline,

22:52.805 --> 22:54.674
and just looking around
the stands,

22:54.707 --> 22:58.445
like, how quickly things change
in basically 72 hours,

22:58.478 --> 23:01.113
you know, from Monday morning
to Thursday afternoon.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.182
And it's just a lesson for me

23:03.215 --> 23:06.753
that you always have
to be ready to adapt

23:06.786 --> 23:10.022
and take on responsibilities
that you didn't anticipate.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.994
So I think as disappointing
as things have been,

23:15.027 --> 23:16.496
hopefully,
everybody looks at this

23:16.529 --> 23:19.031
as an opportunity
to prove to themselves

23:19.065 --> 23:21.934
and to other employees

23:21.968 --> 23:24.103
that I'll fight through this

23:24.136 --> 23:29.476
and I'm gonna be darn good
when things aren't so great.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.644

29:58.230 --> 29:59.899
Rams interim head coach.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.300
Let's go, let's get it,
let's go!

30:01.333 --> 30:04.570
From the 49ers' 30.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.006
They fake the hand-off,
throw right side.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.240
Caught, Kendricks!

30:08.274 --> 30:09.942
25, 20, down the far sideline,

30:09.976 --> 30:11.443
shoved down inside the 10.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.313
Hell yeah!
Atta baby!

30:14.346 --> 30:17.149
-Set.
-They hand off to 30.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.584
Finds a way in, up the middle.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.152
Diving into the end zone.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.922
Touchdown, L.A.
-Way to convert!

30:22.955 --> 30:24.423
Hell of a job!
Good job!

30:24.456 --> 30:27.526
Hamm: Fassel's energy
is rubbing off on the Rams.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.295
Come on, "D!"

30:29.328 --> 30:31.030
Announcer:
Shotgun snap, back to Kaep.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.100
Pocket collapsing around him.
He throws down the seam!

30:34.133 --> 30:35.935
Go!
Let's go!

30:35.968 --> 30:37.269
Let's go!

30:37.303 --> 30:39.438
Atta baby! Whoo!

30:39.471 --> 30:40.472
That-a-way!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.274
-Yeah!
-Nice job!

30:42.308 --> 30:43.876
Announcer: From the Niners' 30.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.577
He hands off, fly sweep.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.313
Go, Tavon!
Go, Tavon!

30:47.346 --> 30:50.382
Announcer: 15, 10 -- Tavon!
Touchdown!

30:50.416 --> 30:51.617
There we go!
Whoo!

30:51.650 --> 30:53.352
On one play, the Rams

30:53.385 --> 30:56.255
go into the end zone
to grab the lead.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.326
-One and done right there.
-That was great.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.962
I know.
Let's do that every time.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.396
Yeah, let's just
do that every time.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.632
That was easy.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.434
Announcer #2:
This is the explosive offense

31:08.467 --> 31:10.669
that we've been looking to see
from the Los Angeles Rams.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.138
Do we even really need
to look at it?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.405
I just want to see
how the blocking was.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.207
Hey, Jared, way to hand
that...off!

31:15.241 --> 31:17.944
That's right.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.478
Oh, I see Daddy.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.113
-You see Daddy?
-Yep.

31:21.147 --> 31:24.050
Make sure he hears you.
Say, "Go, Daddy, go!"

31:24.083 --> 31:25.684
Go, Daddy, go!

31:25.717 --> 31:27.619
Good job!
He heard you.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.688
How do you know?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.457
'Cause he clapped.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.425
Come on, baby, let's go!

31:33.459 --> 31:36.395
Announcer: On third and goal,
inside 11 minutes to go.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.264
Let's go put this...
in the end zone, baby.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.200
Let's go.
-20, set, hut!

31:41.233 --> 31:44.270
Play-action. He drops to the 13.
Throws, end zone.

31:44.303 --> 31:47.573
Caught, touchdown --
Tyler Higbee!

31:47.606 --> 31:49.575
Yeah!
Whoo!

31:49.608 --> 31:51.710
Announcer: Goff hits him,
rookie to rookie,

31:51.743 --> 31:55.314
and adds a touchdown
to the L.A. lead.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.316
Atta way, stud!
Hell of a job, baby!

31:57.349 --> 31:58.517
Atta baby, Barnsey.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.252
Hamm:
Fassel has driven the Rams

32:00.286 --> 32:03.189
to the brink of their
first victory in over a month.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.458
They're up 14 with less
than 6 minutes to play.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.496
But no lead is comfortable
for a star-crossed team.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.265
Announcer: 49ers down two
touchdowns, in field goal range,

32:13.299 --> 32:15.101
keeping the offense
on the field.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.070
Come on, "D!"
Let's go, "D"!

32:18.104 --> 32:22.975
Announcer #2: You get a stop,
and you can run the clock out.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.943
I'm gonna go watch the defense
win the game!

32:28.180 --> 32:30.082
Announcer: Shotgun snap,
looking left all the way.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.550
Throws.
It's caught.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.652
First-down yardage,
Rod Streater out of bounds.

32:33.685 --> 32:38.057
Fourth down and 8.
Unbelievable.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.658
**

32:39.691 --> 32:41.360
Scrambles up the middle.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.529
10, 5. Kaepernick looking
for the end zone.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.331
Cuts it right.
To the pylon.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.766
Touchdown, San Francisco.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.136
And it's back
to a one-score game.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.540
So now the Rams
will get it back,

32:54.573 --> 32:57.143
try and bleed the clock,
pick up some first downs,

32:57.176 --> 33:00.712
and secure a Week 16 victory.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.415
Jared Goff's your future.
See what he has right now.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.152
Third and 5.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.121
And they're letting Goff
throw it.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.123
And Goff goes down.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.627
They got the three-and-out,
the 49ers, to get the ball back.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.296
Gives them a chance.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.098
Williams: Here we go!
We got to put it down.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.167
Where's our pass rush?
Where's our pass rush now?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.801
We got to put them down now.
Let's roll.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.303
Hey,
at least I get a hit.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.411
'Cause we want the defense
to stop them.

33:32.444 --> 33:37.349
Feel it just in the stadium,
the angst of the Rams crowd,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.485
wanting this defense
to get a stop.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.088
**

33:42.121 --> 33:43.389
Throws the slant, left side.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.291
Caught.
Touchdown, San Francisco.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.294
They're going for 2.
They're going for 2.

33:48.327 --> 33:52.564
Announcer: With 31 seconds left
and the Niners down 1.

33:52.598 --> 33:56.668
Let's do, "D"!
Let's go, "D"!

33:58.537 --> 33:59.838
Green, set, hut!

33:59.871 --> 34:01.507
Announcer:
Here's the 2-point conversion.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.409
They fake the hand-off.
Kaepernick rolls right.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.311
He tucks it.
He will run.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.617
**

34:18.824 --> 34:20.726
And in heart-wrenching fashion,

34:20.759 --> 34:23.862
the 49ers come from behind

34:23.895 --> 34:27.533
to steal the Rams' fifth victory
of the year.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.272
Fassel:
Sorry for that, men.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.107
Everybody grinds and works.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.375
Every week, we just keep saying,

34:36.408 --> 34:37.709
"Come on, keep going,
keep working."

34:37.743 --> 34:42.814
And it's not happening.
But it will.

34:42.848 --> 34:46.185
But we'll come back
one more week...

34:46.218 --> 34:48.287
and really see
what we're made of.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.796
Hamm: No one's dwelling on
another hard loss this morning.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.598
It's Christmas.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.300
The players get
to wake up at home,

35:01.333 --> 35:03.202
surrounded by their families,

35:03.235 --> 35:04.836
with presents under the tree.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.639
Oh, look!
Santa came!

35:07.673 --> 35:08.874
That's what
Santa brought.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.777
Oh, my goodness!

35:11.810 --> 35:14.546
Rodger: Christmas in California
is extremely weird.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.315
It is sunny outside.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.518
Feeling a little warm.
[ Chuckles ]

35:19.551 --> 35:21.687
It's a lot different than,
you know,

35:21.720 --> 35:23.622
a lot of snow in St. Louis.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.325
Even Aaliyah has been like,
"Where's the snow?"

35:26.358 --> 35:27.893
But I'm sure
she'll get used to, you know,

35:27.926 --> 35:31.763
Santa coming on a surfboard
with a team of dolphins.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.233
Angela: What is that?

35:34.266 --> 35:37.303
It's an Elsa costume,
just like I asked for!

35:37.336 --> 35:40.906
-Yeah.
-Well, this is mine!

35:40.939 --> 35:46.345
This is my second game.
I came to the home opener.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.780
And so...

35:48.814 --> 35:53.719
this one, I'll just be honest,
they upset me yesterday.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.421
Rodger:
Oh, my goodness, Ma.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.289
But it was a good day.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.725
-A unicorn!
-Yeah.

35:59.758 --> 36:03.595
-I saw a unicorn!
-It's a unicorn, just like me.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.331
Daddy!

36:05.364 --> 36:07.599
It makes you challenge yourself
for this last week.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.501
Instead of going into it like,
"Oh, this is the last week,"

36:09.535 --> 36:10.836
you got to get through it.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.738
I'm gonna challenge myself
to get better,

36:12.771 --> 36:15.707
you know,
throughout the week, but...

36:15.741 --> 36:17.409
Yeah, it was --
he was definitely happy

36:17.443 --> 36:18.677
with the way things were going.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.646
Just, you know,
we got to finish better.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.248
And it's obvious.

36:23.749 --> 36:26.752
Thank God.
[ Laughs ]

36:26.785 --> 36:28.954
Think everybody's frustrated.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.689
But you know what?

36:30.722 --> 36:33.725
I'm a die-hard Ram fan,

36:33.759 --> 36:36.362
and I know things
are gonna turn around.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.596
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God!

36:37.629 --> 36:39.598
Oh, my gosh.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.767
Yes, hon, trust me,
you're not gonna like those.

36:41.800 --> 36:47.373
-Oh, let's see what Mama got.
-Oh, snap!

36:47.406 --> 36:49.708
You know, that's more
business-cas stuff.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.610
Thanks, babe.
I love these!

36:51.643 --> 36:53.011
There's a reason why they --

36:53.044 --> 36:55.314
It's a reason
why they call me "Big Smooth."

36:55.347 --> 36:56.882
-Big Smooth?
-Yeah, Big Smooth.

36:56.915 --> 37:00.786
Oh, now I'm learning
the other side of my son, huh?

37:00.819 --> 37:01.820
Yeah, Big Fashion,
you know.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.922
Uh-huh, big fashion.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.258
**

37:12.564 --> 37:14.366
Hamm: Week 17 --

37:14.400 --> 37:17.769
the end of the road
for the regular season.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.572
But the Rams are still
trying to get better...

37:20.606 --> 37:23.942
for now and for the future.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.412
Man: Are we bringing in
practice-squad wideouts,

37:26.445 --> 37:28.280
-do we know?
-We're -- Yeah.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.615
'Cause, I mean,
it's gonna be hard with --

37:29.648 --> 37:31.783
I mean, we only have
four guys practicing, right?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.819
Looking to bring one
in immediately.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.357
December 27th.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.592
Last -- Week 17,

37:40.626 --> 37:43.362
and told Coach Mac
this morning,

37:43.395 --> 37:45.964
these guys may finally
get a gig.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.368
Hamm:
The Rams have brought in four
wide receivers for a tryout.

37:49.401 --> 37:54.306
One will be added to the
practice squad for the week...

37:54.340 --> 37:58.577
and possibly signed to a futures
contract for next season.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.078
Man: Good, that's it.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.348
That's the kid who was a DB
and moved to receiver.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.484
Yeah, they -- he wasn't
very productive at Temple,

38:05.517 --> 38:07.453
but you can tell
he's an athlete.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.087
-Yeah.
-The guys liked him on --

38:09.120 --> 38:11.523
The guys liked him
in preseason running routes.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.559
-Yeah.
-Any quick thoughts?

38:13.592 --> 38:14.926
Well, it just depends.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.663
If you want size,
to me, it's Caleb.

38:17.696 --> 38:21.367
If you like probably
the most polished guys is Ship.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.001
-Three?
-Number 3, yeah.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.404
The Temple kid played DB
early in his career.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.474
-Okay.
-So he could probably do both.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.975
-Yeah.
-So it might be worthwhile.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.878
What we're gonna do, guys,
we're gonna get you a physical,

38:32.911 --> 38:36.448
and then we'll determine
who might sign.

38:36.482 --> 38:39.585
We're gonna sign a minimum
of one, could be two.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.687
So it will be good news
and bad news.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.088
But, first, we got to get
to the physical,

38:43.121 --> 38:46.024
and then be expecting
to practice this afternoon.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.659
-Okay.
-All right. Thank you.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.027
-Appreciate it.
-Thanks, guys.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.096
Hamm: The newest Ram
won't play on Sunday,

38:51.129 --> 38:54.132
but fresh legs are welcome
on a weary team.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.769
He'll help them in practice
and maybe beyond.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.575
-How are they doing?
-I think pretty good.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.911
-Talk to --
-I mean, considering.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.579
Talk to any individuals?

39:07.613 --> 39:09.948
Yeah, we talked to
quite a few guys.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.384
And their...

39:12.418 --> 39:14.586
morale is low.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.954
-One, two, three.
-Rams!

39:15.987 --> 39:17.989
Fassel: Frustrated and...

39:18.023 --> 39:22.728
But we got to encourage them
to give it one more shot.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.865
I guess just one thought for us
is we all know

39:26.898 --> 39:28.600
that the season's, you know,

39:28.634 --> 39:31.803
sucked as far as the winning
and the losing.

39:31.837 --> 39:35.073
But my goal for us this week
is to make fellowship

39:35.106 --> 39:38.143
for one last week
an important thing.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.780
Maybe all the cellphones
and all that, put them down

39:41.813 --> 39:44.015
maybe just a few more times

39:44.049 --> 39:46.618
and spend a few more minutes
talking to your teammate.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.455
This is the last week.
Let's make it fun.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.623
Screw it. What the hell?
Right?

39:51.657 --> 39:53.191
We want to win
the football game,

39:53.224 --> 39:54.793
but let's spend
some time this week,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.628
you know, six more days,

39:56.662 --> 39:58.129
a little bit more fellowship,
little fun.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.666
Stay in the cafeteria
a little bit longer, right?

40:00.699 --> 40:02.901
Update your Snapchats
maybe later tonight.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.604
Spend a little bit of time, man.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.072
Man:
All right, run install...

40:07.105 --> 40:10.909
Hamm: The Rams are coming to
the end of their season.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.679
But it isn't the end
of their story.

40:13.712 --> 40:16.848
That will continue with
or without the men in charge

40:16.882 --> 40:19.451
of these meeting rooms.

40:19.485 --> 40:23.622
After five years with the Rams,
John Fassel may not see a sixth.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.157
And he's not alone.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.126
No one's job is safe.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.496
**

40:37.168 --> 40:38.570
Enjoy being on the team,

40:38.604 --> 40:41.239
because there is a day
that's coming...

40:41.272 --> 40:44.610
where we're not gonna be
on the team.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.779
This might be the last week
I get to coach.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.615
This might be it for me.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.484
And I don't know
if the phone's gonna ring.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.052
Our goal this week, man,

40:54.085 --> 40:56.788
finish it,
finish it the right way,

40:56.822 --> 40:58.724
and let's have fun doing it.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.927
'Cause it's gonna look
different next year.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.797
So cherish it.
Cherish it.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.634
'Cause we don't know
what the future holds, right?

41:08.667 --> 41:10.636
Man: John, you've been
with the team for a while.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.171
Nobody knows what will happen,
you know, starting next week.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.106
But do you find yourself
getting at all --

41:15.140 --> 41:16.675
I don't know whether
you'd say nostalgic

41:16.708 --> 41:18.143
or whatever that,
you know,

41:18.176 --> 41:20.812
all this could be
coming to an end?

41:20.846 --> 41:22.614
I don't just mean for you,
but for the players

41:22.648 --> 41:23.982
and everybody else?

41:24.015 --> 41:26.151
Yeah, great call.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.053
I think yesterday
when I got to spend

41:28.086 --> 41:29.655
a little bit of time
at home with my wife

41:29.688 --> 41:31.122
and kids, you know,

41:31.156 --> 41:34.660
there might have been
a little bit of nostalgia.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.128
Um...

41:51.142 --> 41:52.811
Sorry.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.782
You know, my second daughter
was born in St. Louis.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.550
Um...

41:58.584 --> 42:01.553
I mean, there's
a lot of coaches that...

42:01.587 --> 42:02.921
have had kids born,
and, you know,

42:02.954 --> 42:04.189
a lot of coaches on our staff

42:04.222 --> 42:06.091
still have their families
back in St. Louis

42:06.124 --> 42:07.659
that didn't move
out here with them.

42:07.693 --> 42:12.731
So a lot of coaches miss
their families, you know.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.165
And, you know,
it takes a long time

42:14.199 --> 42:19.104
to build relationships
with coaches and players.

42:19.137 --> 42:22.307
And I've been able to do
that over five years.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.976
You know, and it's hard to...

42:25.010 --> 42:28.914
think of that just being done.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.917
You know, but yesterday, maybe
just 'cause it was Christmas,

42:31.950 --> 42:33.585
and I finally got
to see my kids,

42:33.619 --> 42:36.655
which it's been a long time,
just thinking back,

42:36.688 --> 42:38.890
you know,
not only this past year,

42:38.924 --> 42:40.792
but the past four years
in St. Louis

42:40.826 --> 42:43.762
where there's been
a lot of great times,

42:43.795 --> 42:47.666
a lot of great memories,
a lot of fellowship built,

42:47.699 --> 42:49.935
a lot of great
relationships built.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.870
And it's gonna change.
And every year, it changes.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.607
But, of course, there's gonna be
many more significant changes

42:55.641 --> 42:57.042
this year than there
has been in the past.

42:57.075 --> 43:00.946
So great question.
But...

43:02.814 --> 43:04.916
I wish you didn't ask it.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.284
Sorry.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.787
**

43:11.056 --> 43:15.126
Sunshine, cleats, grass -- whoo!

43:15.160 --> 43:17.963
I never take any of
these days for granted.

43:22.801 --> 43:23.969
This grass
and these white lines

43:24.002 --> 43:26.204
is like sacred ground, man.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.006
-That it is.
-Huh?

43:28.039 --> 43:29.975
I said, "That it is!"

43:33.211 --> 43:36.648
Great stuff happens
on here, huh?

43:36.682 --> 43:38.817
-Man.
-Nobody would understand.

43:38.850 --> 43:40.385
Nobody.

43:40.418 --> 43:42.988
Don't take it --
Don't take it for granted, man.

43:43.021 --> 43:44.422
Whew.

43:44.455 --> 43:50.428
* Someone

43:50.461 --> 43:53.231
* Reaching for me now

43:53.264 --> 43:54.866
Lead them, now.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.702
-With some swag, now.
-With some swag.

43:56.735 --> 43:58.336
Hey, they don't tell you that.
They just say, "Lead them."

43:58.369 --> 44:00.739
-I say lead I'm with some swag.
-Yeah.

44:00.772 --> 44:06.277
* Through the dark

44:06.311 --> 44:07.979
* Reaching for me now

44:08.013 --> 44:10.448
Just help everybody on the field
protect themselves.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.017
In your precious Son...name
I pray. Amen.

44:12.050 --> 44:13.719
-Amen. Love you, buddy. Hey.
-Let's do it.

44:13.752 --> 44:14.920
-Love playing with you, buddy.
-Yes, sir.

44:14.953 --> 44:15.921
Let's do it.

44:15.954 --> 44:21.693
* You need someone

44:21.727 --> 44:24.295
* To hear you when you sigh

44:24.329 --> 44:25.764
This is the last time
this group's

44:25.797 --> 44:27.165
gonna walk out
the tunnel together, bro.

44:27.198 --> 44:28.466
So y'all enjoy each other, bro,
be blessed.

44:28.499 --> 44:29.801
Say it and mean it.
"Family" on three.

44:29.835 --> 44:30.836
-One, two, three.
-Family.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.003
Let's go, fellas.

44:32.037 --> 44:35.006
* Someone

44:35.040 --> 44:40.011
* To wipe away
those tears you cry *

44:40.045 --> 44:41.246
-Love you, brother.
-Love you, too, man.

44:41.279 --> 44:42.881
Hey, I appreciate
everything, man.

44:42.914 --> 44:45.050
Hell yeah, you, too.
Yeah, have fun today, man.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.152
Let's go get it,
let's go get it!

44:47.185 --> 44:51.857
Set!
* Someone to hold you

44:51.890 --> 44:55.861
* 'Neath the darkened sky

45:01.332 --> 45:02.934
* Someone

45:02.968 --> 45:05.070
Oh, damn.

45:05.103 --> 45:10.008
-* To love you more than I
-Damn!

45:11.843 --> 45:13.111
Damn.

45:16.114 --> 45:18.950
You got a great
future, man.

45:18.984 --> 45:20.051
You got a great future
ahead of you.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.352
I know it's been a grinder,

45:21.386 --> 45:23.388
but great things
coming for you.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.356
Love you, man.

45:25.390 --> 45:28.159
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

45:28.193 --> 45:30.261
* Ooh-ooh

45:30.295 --> 45:32.430
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

45:32.463 --> 45:36.067
For me, the past three weeks
and the opportunity

45:36.101 --> 45:37.535
to be up here in front
of all of you guys

45:37.568 --> 45:41.773
is an opportunity
that I'll never forget

45:41.807 --> 45:45.376
and an opportunity
I'll never take for granted.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.545
And it just goes to show
that at all times,

45:47.578 --> 45:49.480
you got to be ready to jump in
and do something

45:49.514 --> 45:51.850
maybe you weren't
expected to do.

45:51.883 --> 45:56.321
And how you conduct yourself
at all times matters.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.857
I love you, man.
Love you, man.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.026
In the good times,
it's easy to be a pro.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.528
The tough times,
it's tough to be a pro.

46:03.561 --> 46:07.899
I'm super proud of the pros
that are in this room.

46:09.334 --> 46:11.436
So, love you guys.
Appreciate the opportunity.

46:11.469 --> 46:14.005
-Proud to be a Ram.
-Thank you, boss.

46:14.039 --> 46:16.908
[ Applause ]

46:22.347 --> 46:24.049
I'm proud to be a Ram, man.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.483
Proud to be a Ram.

46:25.516 --> 46:28.486
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

46:28.519 --> 46:30.421
* Ooh-ooh

46:30.455 --> 46:32.523
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

46:32.557 --> 46:35.126
* Ooh

46:35.160 --> 46:37.963
Man: We don't know where
everybody's gonna be next year.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.597
But I tell you what,
no matter where you go, man,

46:39.630 --> 46:41.266
just make sure that
when you working out, man,

46:41.299 --> 46:43.068
you're saying no more.

46:43.101 --> 46:45.270
You...put in the work this
off-season wherever you go, man.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.437
No more.

46:46.471 --> 46:47.973
Let's go, baby.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.574
"Together" on three.
One, two, three.

46:49.607 --> 46:50.942
All: Together!

46:50.976 --> 46:53.511
**

47:19.537 --> 47:22.140
Hamm: On the final episode
of "All or Nothing"...

47:22.173 --> 47:25.210
Man: In Los Angeles, the Rams
will introduce Sean McVay

47:25.243 --> 47:26.644
as their new head coach,

47:26.677 --> 47:30.315
the youngest head coach
in modern NFL history.

47:30.348 --> 47:33.251
-How we doing? You look good.
-Thank you.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.285
-Excited?
-Oh, man.

47:34.319 --> 47:35.353
It's a whirlwind.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.155
Man, I'm just like,

47:37.188 --> 47:38.656
there's got to be one damn
mermaid out here, though, man.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.158
-Got to be one mermaid.
-Golly.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.927
If I'm the "Z",
I'm in a close split.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.929
We're all running
the stucco concept,

47:43.962 --> 47:45.363
so we're running scout routes.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.198
Fisher: I want to get back
on the sideline.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.433
We'll just see
what happens.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.535
But watch the draft
from afar.

47:50.568 --> 47:53.171
Man: It's a beautiful night
for a draft in Philadelphia.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.473
Buffalo's got a good deal
on the table.

47:55.506 --> 47:58.243
We would get
their 91st pick.
