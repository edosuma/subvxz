WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:38.664
Goodbye, Belle.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.104
Thought you might like this.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.990
Hm.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.747
Your perspective is wonderful.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.542
It's wonderful.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.503
Oh!

04:25.682 --> 04:28.894
Oh, Matthew, I've had just
the best afternoon!

04:29.686 --> 04:32.022
Can you imagine that of all the trees
on Prince Edward Island,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.941
I managed to find the oldest
and kindest one?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.110
I could.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.031
How many species of birds
would you say there are?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.409
- Because I'm sure I heard at least...
- Gracious me, what's happened to you?

04:44.493 --> 04:47.037
- I was on a big ad...
- Adventure. Yes, I see.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.414
I'll thank you to spare me the details.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.625
You're not coming inside
with those filthy boots on,

04:51.708 --> 04:53.710
that's for sure and certain.
Take them off.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.296
Then you can go right upstairs
and change

04:56.379 --> 04:58.423
out of those wet clothes before supper.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.634
And be quick about it
before you catch your death.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
Pff. Adventure.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.140
A little piece of heaven on earth.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.435
- I churned some fresh butter today.
- Hallelujah.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.522
I've truly found paradise
here at Green Gables.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.234
- Afternoon, Mr. Dunlop!
- Afternoon, dear Anne!

05:18.860 --> 05:20.654
Take your needlepoint, please.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.365
I wouldn't even be doing needlepoint
if I wasn't out of paper.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.284
There'll be plenty more when school
starts up again after harvest.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.621
But needlepoint provides so little scope
for the imagination!

05:38.547 --> 05:40.549
I wonder what's become of Nate.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.345
Well, I guess we should make a start.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.098
My apologies!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.100
So sorry I'm late!

05:52.978 --> 05:55.313
I got lost in my work, again.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.984
- We were getting worried, is all.
- Please don't hold it against me.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.157
Shall I say grace?

06:08.868 --> 06:12.038
My, it's been a long time
since we said grace in this household.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.457
It does seem like there's
an awful lot to be grateful for,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.084
especially now at harvest time...

06:16.793 --> 06:18.378
Grace would be very nice.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.720
Dear Lord, we thank you for...

06:26.803 --> 06:29.931
Oh, could you please say:
"Gracious Heavenly Father?"

06:30.015 --> 06:31.141
Anne.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.643
It sounds so much more romantical.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.148
Gracious Heavenly Father,

06:38.231 --> 06:42.027
please bless this table and the Cuthberts
for taking us into their home.

06:42.569 --> 06:46.239
We give thanks to you for this food
and for the hands that have prepared it.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.950
We ask your blessings upon this meal,
that it will...

06:49.034 --> 06:51.620
nourish our bodies and refresh our souls.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.371
<i>Bless those who are here</i>

06:53.455 --> 06:55.081
<i>and those who are in our hearts.</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:58.418
<i>And all those who are not as fortunate
on this day.</i>

06:59.044 --> 07:01.254
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

07:05.550 --> 07:07.260
Come on, pick it up!
Pick it up!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.978
Hey, watch your back!

07:17.062 --> 07:21.066
Feed the lady, Trinidad.
No one payin' you to take a vacation.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.588
- Ain't funny.
- I wasn't trying to be funny.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.759
Well... maybe a little.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.512
Maybe you boys want
some different job?! That what you want?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.681
Sorry, sir.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.810
Sometimes the music in my soul
just needs to come out.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.687
You want the slit trench?

07:58.770 --> 08:01.314
- That suit you better?
- We're good, sir. Everything fine.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.694
Coming to you, sir.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.030
I suspect latrine duty
would be particularly repugnant.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.740
- Don't act dotish now.
- What's that?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.618
You want no job?
That it?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.287
We goin' real good, sir.
We does like to make she go.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.372
This work be a privilege.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.374
No more jawing.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.849
- Hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Just about to head out.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.851
Is there any chance
I could come with you today?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.686
I'm sure I could get my chores
done quickly

08:39.769 --> 08:42.230
and since school is out for harvest,
I don't have anywhere else to be.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.275
I don't think you'd find digging dirt
all day very interesting.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.317
I would!

08:46.943 --> 08:49.070
Please?
I never get to see what you're doing

08:49.154 --> 08:51.281
and I think that the science
of rocks and such

08:51.364 --> 08:52.699
is positively fascinating.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.661
When I first came to Prince Edward Island,
I marvelled at the red roads, I truly did.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.414
If you hadn't come to stay,
I would've never known why they're red.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.876
The words iron oxide give me
such a thrill!

09:02.959 --> 09:04.961
They sound so scientific!

09:06.713 --> 09:09.174
Oh! It's a whole universe!

09:09.758 --> 09:11.926
And to think that your employer,
far away in America,

09:12.010 --> 09:14.721
might want this very soil
more than anything.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.097
Isn't the world a remarkable place?

09:16.181 --> 09:17.432
You never stop talking.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.934
<i>And then,
Princess Cordelia</i>

09:20.018 --> 09:23.396
raised her big, bad pistol
and pointed it at the kitten.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.731
What?!

09:24.814 --> 09:27.525
Oh, Princess Cordelia,
please spare me my life!

09:27.609 --> 09:30.111
The kitten was destined to die.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.323
Anne, stop talking,
you're supposed to be asleep.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
Anne Shirley, come here!

09:37.452 --> 09:40.163
Esther, bring the books!

09:40.705 --> 09:41.790
One hour.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.333
Maybe two.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.626
We'll see.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.221
Not. One. Word.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.556
You could do all the talking.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.725
You can regale me with every bit
of information you ever knew

10:00.809 --> 10:02.519
about rocks and soils and minerals...

10:02.602 --> 10:05.980
You know, Miss Marilla will have my hide.
I can't steal you away

10:06.064 --> 10:09.067
- right when there's extra work to be done.
- But harvest is tomorrow...

10:10.151 --> 10:11.402
Tell you what...

10:12.904 --> 10:14.322
If you read this,

10:14.405 --> 10:16.741
you'll know everything I know
and more. Hm?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.828
Best and final offer...

10:21.371 --> 10:23.123
You'll live to regret lending this to me

10:23.206 --> 10:25.166
because I'm going to learn
everything there is to know about...

10:25.250 --> 10:26.751
- Geology.
- I have no doubt.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.337
I'll have to ask you a thousand
questions, if you don't mind.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.296
Fair warning.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.842
Ge-ology.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.010
Out.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.283
Oh my word!

11:01.077 --> 11:02.871
Sorry, did I... scare you?

11:03.872 --> 11:06.875
I-I-I thought you were gone.
I would never have...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.294
I had a small, red-headed delay.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.508
My, my, your hair smells as fresh
as a summer breeze.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.054
Well, I'm off.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.098
Sorry for the intrusion.

11:42.619 --> 11:47.123
- Today's the day, yes?
- Today's the day. Finally.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.459
Time to bait the hook.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.128
Ah, bountiful harvest.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.548
Love me some full pockets
looking to spend.

12:10.772 --> 12:14.317
Anne! For heaven's sake.
Take the pail to the barn!

12:15.735 --> 12:17.362
Yes! Sorry!

12:17.737 --> 12:20.323
- She's a character, that one.
- She's a case, I should say.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.958
Ah!

12:30.750 --> 12:33.670
- What are you doing?!
- Working. What are you doing?!

12:33.753 --> 12:37.090
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- Something boring that isn't work.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.634
Hardly.
Nate gave me this book.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.220
Something's wrong with that guy.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.597
What?
Why do you say that?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.391
I dunno...

12:46.975 --> 12:50.144
- I just...
- Well, this book is extremely interesting.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.898
And Nate happens to understand
that reading is a necessity.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.984
<i>I'm a rabbit!</i>

12:56.067 --> 12:57.485
Anne, stop it now, stop!

12:57.568 --> 13:00.905
I'm a rabbit, see? I'm a fluffy
little bouncing bunny rabbit!

13:13.501 --> 13:15.712
Reading is in my life's blood.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.047
I mean, look!

13:18.798 --> 13:21.342
Look at this sentence!
Isn't it glorious?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.885
Sometimes you're not very nice.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.805
What do you mean?
Why are you... Jerry!

13:26.848 --> 13:29.017
No school for me, remember?

13:30.601 --> 13:31.853
I could teach you to read.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.187
Don't bother.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.524
Words are made up of letters from
something called the alphabet.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.360
There are 26 letters in it -
the alphabet -

13:39.444 --> 13:43.031
and it has infinite combinations
to make up every word that there is!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.285
Maybe let's start with your name.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.370
Um...

13:49.454 --> 13:53.041
so, this is the letter "J".

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
This is "E"...

14:11.768 --> 14:14.771
I say, do you need some assistance?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.272
Sorry, I...

14:17.273 --> 14:18.775
It's Mr. Barry, right?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.069
Right indeed.
And you are...?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.155
Nathaniel.
Nate.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.993
- I've been boarding at Green Gables.
- Yes, the... geologist?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.204
Unfortunately, yes.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.290
So, what seems to be the trouble?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.959
I-I... I really shouldn't say.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.712
It's... just so frustrating, is all.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.511
Maybe you've heard, I...

14:47.095 --> 14:48.888
I work for a big chemical company.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.308
And they hired me
to extract iron oxide from the soil.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.894
Ah. So that's what this is all about, eh?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.022
Looks like you're headed to China.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.149
Well, feels like it sometimes.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.027
This is un-owned land, correct?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.529
Yes, that's right.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.240
I own 100 acres going across the other...

15:07.323 --> 15:09.075
And they're gonna take it!

15:10.118 --> 15:12.120
Not yours.
This-this here, the...

15:13.121 --> 15:16.749
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to keep... popping my cork.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.001
No-no, not to worry.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.920
The thing is, is, um...

15:23.548 --> 15:24.966
I've found gold.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.136
There, I said it.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.555
I'm pretty sure it's a big find, too.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.517
I sent a soil sample out to New York
for independent testing.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.935
I'm waiting to hear.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.979
I did it without my...

15:38.062 --> 15:40.106
dear company's knowledge...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.567
because once they know...

15:42.775 --> 15:45.403
phew, they'll grab all the land rights.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.364
It could be worth millions.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.575
Quite...

15:52.577 --> 15:53.703
Sorry to burden you, but...

15:53.786 --> 15:56.789
...it felt good to finally say it aloud.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.419
In confidence.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.587
Ah!

16:03.171 --> 16:05.965
Everyone here in Avonlea
sure are good folk.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.676
Shame for y'all not to have the profits;

16:08.759 --> 16:10.386
the gold could be everywhere.

16:12.180 --> 16:16.184
- See you soon, Mr. Barry.
- Ah, call me William, please.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.729
William. Bye for now.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.138
Two days of this.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.642
Fireman's not the only one
who don't appreciate that song.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.648
- I was just joking around.
- Well, don't.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.444
You're right, you're right,
Fireman is an easy target.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.196
That's not why.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.532
What's eating you?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.871
I been trimmer for 10 years.
More.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.457
This is all I have.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.667
I can't move up, this is it for me.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.462
And there ain't nothin' for me
on dry land.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.257
You're a white boy...

17:30.675 --> 17:31.926
You got options.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.514
You're a tourist, Blythe.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.684
I need this.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.271
Don't lose this work for me.
Understand?

17:47.275 --> 17:48.276
Yeah.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.238
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.498
And you don't sing worth a damn.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.710
Says you!

18:09.505 --> 18:14.302
Ah! Isn't this just the most
beautiful day there ever was?!

18:15.303 --> 18:17.722
I love autumn.
I just love it!

18:18.097 --> 18:21.225
I'm so glad I get to live in a world
where there are Octobers, aren't you?

18:23.436 --> 18:24.520
I'm still trying to understand

18:24.604 --> 18:26.731
why you haven't been to the beach
since you were children.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.650
- Never really thought of it.
- Never thought of it?!

18:29.734 --> 18:32.737
Never really had an opportunity,
I suppose.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.949
But you've had every opportunity!
For 50 years!

18:37.533 --> 18:40.870
I love you both very much
but this is positively mystifying!

18:40.953 --> 18:42.163
Mystifying!

18:42.246 --> 18:44.874
I've been longing to go every day
for all of my 14 years

18:44.957 --> 18:46.751
but I've never had the chance.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.045
I can't wait to find out
what we've all been missing

18:49.128 --> 18:52.131
because I'm quite sure
we've been missing a lot!

18:54.759 --> 18:56.260
- Oh, stop!
- What?

18:56.344 --> 18:58.346
Stop the buggy! Stop!

18:59.138 --> 19:01.682
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whatever's the matter, Anne?

19:01.766 --> 19:04.769
Ugh. Wait here!
I'll be right back!

19:08.356 --> 19:09.607
Anne!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.069
Anne!

19:13.778 --> 19:14.779
What the devil?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.365
Anne!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.383
Oh!

19:51.982 --> 19:53.693
Isn't it glorious?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.742
Anne! What are you doing?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.119
Oh no... Come back here.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.787
Anne! Oh!

20:04.870 --> 20:06.205
Oh! Look at this!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.291
Matthew!

20:09.375 --> 20:11.544
Matthew, stop her.
It's dangerous.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.964
Anne, come back here
this instant!

20:15.047 --> 20:17.133
Come in! Come in!
It's wonderful!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.551
No, it's cold, Anne!

20:18.634 --> 20:20.636
Matthew, will you stop her? Just... Oh!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.304
- Ah!
- Bring her back here!

20:24.223 --> 20:25.182
Oof!

20:25.558 --> 20:26.392
Ah!

20:26.851 --> 20:29.103
- Pretty cold, eh?
- It's perfect!

20:29.186 --> 20:30.563
- Ooh-ooh!
- Anne!

20:33.774 --> 20:35.568
- Matthew, come back here.
- Come in!

20:35.651 --> 20:37.027
- Don't be silly.
- Come on, Marilla.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.071
- Come on, come in!
- Ah!

20:41.657 --> 20:43.576
Matthew! Matthew!

20:46.287 --> 20:48.622
Ooh! Oh! Matthew!

20:50.124 --> 20:51.375
Save her!

20:56.464 --> 20:59.091
I got so excited I forgot I can't swim!

21:01.260 --> 21:02.678
Is she all right?!

21:02.762 --> 21:04.263
Anne, are you all right?!

21:06.682 --> 21:07.975
I'm fine!

21:09.268 --> 21:10.770
You want to learn?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.188
With your legs, kick with your legs.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.606
Kick, kick, kick.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.484
Paddle with your hands like a puppy,
there it is.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.200
Can the first thing we do
with all the harvest money

21:24.283 --> 21:26.243
be to buy back Burty the horse.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.078
I miss him.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.625
I'm fairly certain that...
we'll have enough.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.716
I love it here.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.054
<i>I love looking out at the horizon</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:48.307
<i>and imagining all the other places
there are in the world</i>

21:49.308 --> 21:51.936
<i>and all the possibilities.</i>

22:26.971 --> 22:29.473
You don't see me barging into your room
whenever the mood strikes me.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.685
Sorry. The temptation was irresistible.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.104
Oh, Nate, we had such a marvellous time
at the beach yesterday.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.940
I feel positively irrepressible!

22:38.023 --> 22:39.108
Oh, uh...

22:39.191 --> 22:42.528
the book keeps falling open
to this chapter on gold.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.864
And then, I noticed that it seems to be
the only one that's, well, beloved.

22:45.948 --> 22:49.493
It looks like you've read this chapter
over and over and over again.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.413
There's coffee stains and smudges
and underlines, and...

22:52.496 --> 22:54.206
And then I noticed this little map
you drew

22:54.290 --> 22:55.708
with dimensions and plans for building...

22:55.791 --> 22:57.376
I can't talk about it!

23:01.589 --> 23:03.215
I'm sorry.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.222
It's just that...

23:11.223 --> 23:12.766
I'm in a moral quandary.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.479
I'll know soon what to do.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.274
I... I want, above all,
to do the right thing.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.695
- Can you understand that?
- Yes. But can I...

23:24.778 --> 23:25.946
I-I...

23:26.822 --> 23:31.410
I need you to hold a good thought
and don't say anything to anyone...

23:32.036 --> 23:33.829
until I figure things out,

23:33.912 --> 23:36.248
and end this turmoil in my heart.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.502
Can you do that for me?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.633
Shh.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.428
Shh.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.182
So just write
another Bert story.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.558
Another Bert story?

23:54.642 --> 23:56.769
You always write a version
of the same thing.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.853
No, I don't!

23:57.936 --> 24:00.814
About a dashing hero
named Albert, Herbert, Rupert,

24:00.898 --> 24:02.566
- Pilpert...
- Pilpert?!

24:02.650 --> 24:07.196
That's ridiculous. I would never write
a story about a boy named Pilpert.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.489
It's not like we can't tell...

24:08.572 --> 24:12.159
You always murder everyone,
you can't figure out what to do

24:12.242 --> 24:13.619
- with your characters.
- ...are about Gilbert.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.537
No, they're not!

24:15.621 --> 24:17.915
How else am I supposed
to deal with the fact

24:17.998 --> 24:20.376
that he's been gone
for eight months and three days

24:20.459 --> 24:22.586
and he may never come back?!

24:24.880 --> 24:27.883
Anne, please take your nose
out of that book and help me here.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.387
How about...

24:31.470 --> 24:35.808
a tragical tale
of a sad and handsome scientist

24:35.891 --> 24:39.478
who one day stumbles upon a secret
that could save the world?

24:39.561 --> 24:43.857
Oh, Anne! However do you think
of such amazing things all the time?

24:43.941 --> 24:45.401
I draw from life, Diana.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.695
I draw from life.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.907
Oh! I almost forgot!
I've had a letter from Aunt Josephine!

24:51.990 --> 24:54.702
She's very keen to read
some of our stories!

24:56.328 --> 24:58.414
Let's only send her our very best.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.541
Well, then, we should send her
all of Anne's.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.502
Let's send her one each.
To be fair.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.838
Come!

25:07.339 --> 25:08.382
- Anne.
- Thank you.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.271
Ah!

25:22.354 --> 25:26.442
VoilÃ , the alphabet!
Now we can really get started.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.861
I was thinking about it, but...

25:28.944 --> 25:30.988
I don't really need to know how to read.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.656
Um, thanks anyways.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.869
Of course you need to know how to read!
Reading is-is everything.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.913
Every book has a whole world inside it.

25:39.997 --> 25:43.292
There's adventure, romance,

25:43.375 --> 25:44.710
ships,

25:44.793 --> 25:46.920
gunfights, knights on horseback!

25:47.004 --> 25:49.840
You never know what's gonna happen
until you begin!

25:49.923 --> 25:53.260
You can be anyone.
Go anywhere.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.935
Reading can save your life.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.941
Alright. I'll try it.

26:08.025 --> 26:11.111
Yes! I'm currently out of paper but...

26:11.195 --> 26:12.571
I brought some visual aids.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.494
"A" is for Apple.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.746
Those letters are here.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.916
A, P, puh.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.334
Puh.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.002
- Another P.
- Puh.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.129
- L.
- L.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.589
E. Apple.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.022
- Can't stand that nosy little kid.
- She's not so bad.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.235
She's a pain in my ass.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.737
I had to tap dance today, Jonesey.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.156
Had to navigate around her...
evil little mind.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.950
She's seconds away
from tipping the grift.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.244
She's just a girl.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.830
Curiosity killed the cat.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.040
So use it.

27:21.098 --> 27:24.017
Jonesey, there's a reason
we've been makin' hay for so long.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.395
Good idea.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.980
Yeah.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.356
Yeah... let's kill the cat.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.199
Careful now, careful...

27:39.283 --> 27:41.493
Let's make my great aunt Beatrice proud!

27:43.662 --> 27:46.415
Thing of beauty! Huh?
Sing it with me now!

27:49.293 --> 27:51.420
And now the fun part!
Decorating!

27:51.503 --> 27:54.590
- And I can choose anything I want?
- If you can dream it, we can do it.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.885
- You can't decorate a pie.
- Can't we?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.679
Oh, can't we?

28:02.890 --> 28:05.017
While I was fighting in the Boer War,

28:05.100 --> 28:08.687
I lost all hope of ever experiencing
simple pleasures again.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.148
- Was it very terrible?
- It was...

28:12.107 --> 28:13.442
It was unspeakable.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.693
It was...

28:15.319 --> 28:18.238
I lost my family;
my parents and my sister,

28:18.322 --> 28:20.115
during my years away.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.826
It's been difficult to bear.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.453
Jane Eyre said,

28:24.536 --> 28:30.125
"You cannot at all imagine the craving
I have for fraternal and sisterly love."

28:30.918 --> 28:33.962
It made me feel ever so comforted
to know that she felt as I did.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.549
So I know a-a bit of how you feel
and I'm sorry that you feel it.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.843
I could be your sister.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.346
Your very little sister.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.727
It's done me such a world of good
being here at Green Gables.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.064
I'm starting to wish
I could stay in Avonlea forever.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.942
Oh! Wouldn't that be nice?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.278
How about autumn leaves?

28:58.362 --> 28:59.655
- Brilliant.
- Oh!

28:59.738 --> 29:01.573
Place them anywhere you want.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.782
Hey, little man.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.785
<i>AllÃ´.</i>

29:48.203 --> 29:51.498
Are you trying to better yourself, huh?
Huh?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.128
Ooh. Close but no cigar.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.421
Gimme that.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.341
You wanna get somewhere in life,

30:01.425 --> 30:04.219
you gotta pay attention to the details.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.221
See this "Q"?

30:07.431 --> 30:10.017
It's supposed to have a tail.
You missed it, pal.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.146
I wasn't finished.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.815
A tail like a little French...

30:17.774 --> 30:18.650
...pig.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.157
Aren't you bored of this yet?

30:27.951 --> 30:31.079
Someone is bored of their chores.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.289
Little thief!

30:32.372 --> 30:33.415
Come out from there!

30:33.498 --> 30:36.501
Don't you know it is wicked to covet?
Wicked to steal?

30:36.585 --> 30:38.712
You risked so much to take this.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.089
You must have wanted it very, very badly.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.342
Well, then...

30:47.721 --> 30:49.389
...it's all yours.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.229
You're bored of this, right?

30:56.313 --> 30:58.607
Nope! I'm not finished yet.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.068
And I like geology,
it's not boring at all!

31:02.694 --> 31:04.071
Good.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.491
Good. See you kids later.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.706
Is something wrong?

31:15.499 --> 31:17.501
He is a bad man...

31:19.086 --> 31:20.212
What happened?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.215
Nothing. Nothing.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.716
I don't know.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.344
I'm going.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.806
Don't you want your lesson?

31:31.473 --> 31:32.891
Not today. Bye.

31:49.116 --> 31:52.244
Ahem! Excuse the interruption, Nathaniel.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.329
Any clothes that need mending?

31:56.123 --> 31:57.124
Uh...

31:58.125 --> 31:59.835
Can I give you the shirt off my back?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.546
I... ripped a cuff today.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.552
You sure take good care of me.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.763
- Won't take long.
- Hm.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.768
Much obliged.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.487
Honestly, William, you're making me dizzy.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.364
I've never seen you like this.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.367
Won't you tell me what's the matter?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.287
As you can see I'm trying to think.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.831
Well, I'd be very happy to help you.

32:37.914 --> 32:41.168
I've got two perfectly good ears
right here, ready to go...

32:43.795 --> 32:45.380
Darling, what's on your mind?

32:54.181 --> 32:56.391
I'd offer you a penny
for your thoughts, but...

32:56.808 --> 32:58.268
I haven't any money.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.855
William?!

33:04.983 --> 33:07.986
I just want to do something
that matters for once.

33:19.206 --> 33:22.375
Care to join us?
We were just jawin'.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.836
- Want your chair?
- No, no. No.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.005
It's fine.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.633
It's fine.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.766
Checked in with that French kid
again today.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.227
Crazy how it never, ever clicks for him.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.271
The little frog just doesn't remember.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.149
We sure are
a couple of lucky stiffs.

33:46.233 --> 33:49.778
Gonna go out on a limb and say
it's safe to stop poking that bear.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.321
Don't tell me what to do.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.828
Well, well, what's all this?

33:58.912 --> 33:59.955
It's just a...

34:00.038 --> 34:01.790
Don't open it now.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.458
G'night!

34:04.459 --> 34:06.044
It's an apron!

34:06.127 --> 34:07.879
Hope you like it.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.715
Ahem.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.052
Everyone in Avonlea sure can make
a fortune from the gold I found.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.638
You have to tell the town.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.181
It's only fair,
they could all strike it rich.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.393
I know, I know, the money
from the gold should go to the townsfolk,

34:22.476 --> 34:25.313
not the company.
I want to do the right thing.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.190
I love it here.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.819
The Cuthberts are
some of the finest people I know.

34:30.902 --> 34:31.945
I agree.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.364
Argh, I'm so torn,
what a moral quandary.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.993
Do I do my job
and tell my company or...

34:38.076 --> 34:39.995
do I go with my heart
and tell the town?

34:40.911 --> 34:44.916
Only your conscience
can guide you to the right decision.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.304
Anne!

34:59.264 --> 35:00.140
Anne!

35:01.725 --> 35:05.103
Take some of this...
abundance to Rachel.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.982
Not those.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.866
Where is Mr. Cuthbert? The fields?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.368
Um... In the barn, I think.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.661
Want me to take it?

35:21.745 --> 35:24.456
No, no, I'll go.
I could use the exercise.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.333
That's for your family.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.548
Thank you.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.469
- Hello, Mrs. Lynde!
- Hello, Anne.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.887
What have we here?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.680
An overabundance of scones?

35:40.764 --> 35:42.515
Mr. Dunlop's been teaching me to bake.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.684
Both of our boarders are nice.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.061
Very nice.

35:47.437 --> 35:50.148
- I suppose I should be going.
- Is something the matter?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.736
Is something weighing on you, dear?

35:54.819 --> 35:58.073
Come, come, it's not healthful
to hold things in.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.868
Bad for the heart.
I don't charge for my advice.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.536
Even though it's worth a fortune.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.667
It's a secret. I...

36:09.167 --> 36:10.377
Ooh!

36:11.795 --> 36:14.589
Go on, dear.
It's safe with me.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.805
All right, all right!

36:22.597 --> 36:25.100
He is trying to answer!

36:25.183 --> 36:27.185
What if there's no gold?

36:29.896 --> 36:32.190
Give the man a chance!

36:40.198 --> 36:43.910
Now then, one at a time.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.537
Everybody, please sit.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.747
This community will be polite
and respectful

36:47.831 --> 36:49.833
of what this man is trying to tell us.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.963
Sir?
Yes, you, sir. Thank you.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.549
My name is Thomas Lynde
and my wife and I want to know

36:57.632 --> 36:59.426
where you sent the gold sample.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.719
Yes, we do.

37:00.802 --> 37:03.888
I sent the sample to an independent
company in New York

37:03.972 --> 37:05.140
for testing and confirmation.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.143
As I said...
I didn't want my employer to know.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.561
Where's the proof?

37:09.644 --> 37:11.980
How do we know you're telling the truth?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.566
How do we know what's real
and what is fool's gold?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.109
I'm glad you asked.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.612
I have here a certificate I received
in the mail from New York.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.784
This Soils Report certifies
that there is indeed...

37:24.868 --> 37:26.578
...gold in Avonlea.

37:26.661 --> 37:29.414
I mentioned I had taken this action
earlier to William Barry.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.875
Nathaniel told me
in the strictest confidence.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.502
He was in a moral quandary
and it all came out.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.005
There really is gold in Avonlea...

37:37.088 --> 37:39.591
Father is quite preoccupied
at the prospect.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.802
Do you really think we'll all be rich
like you, Diana?!

37:42.886 --> 37:44.345
Oh, yes, Mr. Andrews.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.351
And just how do we proceed?

37:50.435 --> 37:54.105
Each landowner would send in
a sample of their soil to New York

37:54.189 --> 37:56.816
for testing.
Now, I warn you, it's expensive.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.818
It's... $150 per test.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.905
Money! I knew there was a catch!

38:01.988 --> 38:05.200
It's an investment, fair enough.
But an investment in the future.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.702
It's close to half
what most folks make in a year.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.164
The reward for mining this land -
your land -

38:11.623 --> 38:12.624
is incalculable.

38:12.707 --> 38:16.044
I have to write to Gilbert!
I have to let him know about the gold!

38:16.127 --> 38:17.045
Gilbert?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.631
But you don't even know where he is!

38:19.714 --> 38:21.925
I think I have a way I can find out!

38:22.008 --> 38:23.134
Anne!

38:23.218 --> 38:27.096
$150 is a substantial
amount of money.

38:27.180 --> 38:30.892
Perhaps I could offer some assistance
for those in need?

38:31.518 --> 38:34.437
If it seems like
an overwhelming proposition,

38:34.521 --> 38:38.107
you could consolidate everyone's payment
and send it in all together,

38:38.191 --> 38:40.610
as a community.
I'd be happy to do that for you.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.745
Look...

38:51.287 --> 38:53.748
I don't have a horse in this race.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.625
I'm not trying to push this,
I'm really not.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.754
I'm not from here and I don't mean
to poke my nose in your business.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.383
This is your decision.
Individually.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.801
I'm just...

39:05.760 --> 39:08.888
I'm trying to offer you an opportunity.
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.979
Put your money
where your mouth is!

39:18.189 --> 39:20.275
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me plain!

39:21.359 --> 39:25.113
Now, I'm not from here either,
but I'll say out loud, here and now,

39:25.196 --> 39:26.489
I love this town.

39:27.991 --> 39:30.994
I love Avonlea
and I intend to set down roots.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.997
I want to be here, gold or no.

39:34.664 --> 39:35.999
What about you, Nathaniel?

39:40.545 --> 39:43.089
- I-I-I...
- You just gonna walk away?

39:43.172 --> 39:44.924
Stick with that company you work for?

39:45.008 --> 39:47.927
A company without morals
that would steal the profit

39:48.011 --> 39:49.929
from the mouths of good people...

39:50.013 --> 39:52.599
- It's my job. It's all I have.
- So quit!

39:53.600 --> 39:54.642
What?!

39:54.726 --> 39:57.687
Make your fortune here.
Bet on Avonlea!

39:57.770 --> 39:59.355
Yeah!

39:59.439 --> 40:02.108
Why not be in charge
of this-this mining operation?

40:02.191 --> 40:03.401
You seem to know the business.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.279
You've proven that
we can count on you, Nathaniel.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.406
You are a moral man.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.535
I would feel much better about this
endeavour if you undertook to oversee it.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.288
What say you?
Will you do it?

40:15.371 --> 40:18.666
If there is a vast fortune here,
what have you got to lose?

40:23.838 --> 40:25.840
I'm not a betting man.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.552
But I'll bet on Avonlea,
I'll quit my job!

40:54.661 --> 40:56.871
Paper, paper!

41:14.013 --> 41:16.099
Oh! Perfect!

41:21.145 --> 41:23.314
Hm. What's this?

41:34.784 --> 41:36.244
New York City...

41:36.327 --> 41:37.704
We're home!

41:54.929 --> 41:57.724
Glad to see you're all tucked in
safe and sound.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.643
Nothing amiss?

42:00.727 --> 42:02.061
Amiss?

42:02.145 --> 42:04.439
Didn't get into any trouble
while we were out?

42:06.149 --> 42:08.651
I've decided to write a letter
to Gilbert Blythe.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.653
It seems only fair he should know
about the gold.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.739
What if it runs under his farm?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.158
You're a kind and thoughtful girl, Anne.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.535
Do you know where he is?

42:17.618 --> 42:20.413
He was planning to get work on a steamer
outside of Charlottetown.

42:20.496 --> 42:23.875
I thought maybe Aunt Josephine might be
able to help me figure out which one.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.879
You know, from the list... thingy,
the-the ship...

42:27.962 --> 42:30.548
- Ship's manifest?
- Yes!

42:31.174 --> 42:34.302
Oh! Doesn't that sound romantical?

42:34.385 --> 42:37.472
The-the manifest,
not the letter to Gilbert.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.723
Good night.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.686
- Did you say your prayers?
- I will.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.999
Gracious Heavenly Father,

43:06.209 --> 43:09.587
I hardly know where to start
regarding everything I'm grateful for.

43:10.213 --> 43:14.008
As for the things I want, I guess
I'll just name the two most important.

43:20.765 --> 43:25.603
Please let there be gold in Avonlea so
that there's no more hardship for anyone.

43:26.479 --> 43:31.025
And please, please
help me get my letter to Gilbert.

43:33.611 --> 43:36.114
And please be sure
I don't misspell any words.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.241
Amen.

43:53.798 --> 43:56.259
Oh, and I'll replace Nate's paper.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.869
Ah!
