WEBVTT

00:10.750 --> 00:12.166
Oh!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.125
Oh, hey, Gross Bob.

00:17.458 --> 00:20.917
I just came from a dark, dank place
where no man should ever have to go.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.333
Oh, you're talking about
stall three in the men's room?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.875
Or as I call it, "my place of business."

00:26.959 --> 00:29.041
See, I call it that
'cause I do my business--

00:29.125 --> 00:30.583
No, no, no, I get it. Thank you.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.625
No, I'm talking about this thing.

00:33.125 --> 00:36.458
The balls were coming out too fast
so I fixed it by reversing the motor.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.250
Oh, all right.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.583
Oh, man.

00:52.792 --> 00:55.291
Whoa.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.709
What's going on?

00:57.375 --> 00:59.458
New sunset karate class just let out.

00:59.542 --> 01:00.709
We teach it out on the wharf.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.959
It combines
the meditative tranquility of karate

01:03.083 --> 01:04.792
with the serenity of a beautiful sunset.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.959
And it's full of hot ladies!

01:14.083 --> 01:15.709
Yo, this place stinks, man.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.917
Oh, that could be my shoes.

01:20.417 --> 01:21.625
My foot fungus is back

01:21.709 --> 01:22.959
with a vengeance.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.917
Whoa, dude.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.542
Yeah, you're gonna have to spray 'em.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.709
Spray 'em?
These things are about to blow, man.

01:38.667 --> 01:39.583
Hey.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.166
Hey, do you guys think
my job is a loser job?

01:43.417 --> 01:45.041
- Oh, yes.
- Absolutely.

01:50.875 --> 01:54.500
All right, everybody, we're about to begin
Moonlight Glow Bowl.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.792
Don't forget to get
a free glow-in-the-dark milk shake.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.291
Oh, what's a glow-in-the-dark milk shake?

01:59.375 --> 02:01.667
Oh, they're made with a special ingredient
that glows in the dark

02:01.750 --> 02:03.166
So you always know where your shake is.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.625
Well, if it's free

02:04.709 --> 02:07.375
I'm gonna drink enough of 'em
till I light up like a firefly.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.834
It's Moonlight Glow Bowl time.

02:11.917 --> 02:15.417
Prepare to see the bowling alley light up
in magical illumination.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.667
Oh, I think I overdid it.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.875
I gotta get out of here.

02:23.959 --> 02:25.375
I think I'm gonna hurl.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.709
This way, Bob. Follow me.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.417
Which one's you? It's too dark.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.542
I'm right here.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.458
Oh, there you are.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.542
Man, I hate this job.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.166

03:26.291 --> 03:27.625
Oh, hey, Joan. What's going on?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.041
I'll tell you what's going on.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.000
The mayor's son is having
a birthday party here.

03:33.083 --> 03:37.417
I'm in charge,
so security is gonna be pretty tight.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.000
Uh, Joan, that guy just stole
your sign-up table.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.542
Oh, well.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.834
Chief of Police told me
to even get a partner.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.291
So listen up, potential partners.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.667
This is an equal opportunity job.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.417
It's based on what you know

03:53.500 --> 03:55.917
not what you look like, okay?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.291
Take a hike, shortstop.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.083
Oh, not gonna happen, gramps.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.458
Oh, waaa.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.834
Beat feet, weird eye.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.208
Hello, tall, dark, and hired.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.750
Whoa, oh, oh.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.250
Yo, Joan.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.709
Hey, how about I become your partner?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.959
A new job with some respect
is just what I need.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.208
You? Oh, please.

04:23.291 --> 04:25.750
You're not right,
you've got no experience.

04:25.834 --> 04:26.875
You're just a kid.

04:27.291 --> 04:30.667
Believe me, there's no shortage of people

04:30.750 --> 04:32.000
who wanna be my part--

04:34.166 --> 04:35.583
Welcome to the Force, partner.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.875
Let the sunset take you
to a tranquil place.

04:42.959 --> 04:47.083
Let the gentle sea breeze
take your worries away.

04:47.166 --> 04:51.333
Let sensei Rudy take you out
for a relaxing fajita dinner.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.583
Excuse me, pardon me.

04:54.667 --> 04:55.834
Move!

04:56.500 --> 04:57.875
Milton...

04:57.959 --> 04:59.709
Get your speed walking group out of here.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.542
- Go to the park.
- No, you go to the park.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.709
We do our laps here
'cause it has the best views.

05:03.792 --> 05:06.792
Yeah, we know, that's why
we do our sunset karate class here.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.291
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know
that pretending to stretch

05:09.417 --> 05:12.041
while checking out chicks
was something you could teach.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.291
Our class is way more legit
than your parade of hip waddlers.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.875
- Speed walking is a joke.
- How dare you.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.750
I challenge you
to a speed walk at the park.

05:19.834 --> 05:22.000
Winner gets to use
the wharf courtyard at sunset.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.834
Fine, this Wednesday at 6:00.

05:23.917 --> 05:24.834
I'm gonna take you down.

05:24.917 --> 05:26.166
I'm gonna take you down.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.166
Ah! Ah! Ah!

05:38.875 --> 05:41.041
All right, everyone, calm down.

05:41.750 --> 05:42.750
We're here.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.125
Now, I want you to know

05:46.208 --> 05:49.417
that we take security
for the mayor's son very...

05:51.166 --> 05:52.834
...seriously.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.667
I am Chief of Police McGruder.

05:58.875 --> 06:02.000
We don't care if you're
the Pirate Prince of Penzance.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.792
This is our house, Mini Mouse.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.041
This is our town, Charlie Brown.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.000
This is our jurisdiction...

06:11.542 --> 06:12.875
Charlie Brown!

06:14.667 --> 06:17.041
All right, you two, Starsky, Hutch--

06:17.125 --> 06:18.667
I need you to go out to the parking lot

06:18.750 --> 06:21.000
and get my bazooka
off the roof of my minivan.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.458
It's the one with the bazooka on the roof.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.667
Who are you guys?

06:29.166 --> 06:30.709
- Mall cops.
- Mall cops.

06:34.667 --> 06:37.792
Okay, guys, calm down,
show a little respect, all right?

06:37.875 --> 06:40.834
I requested these two
for a special mission.

06:40.917 --> 06:44.125
Oh, who's laughing now, huh?

06:45.208 --> 06:49.083
What is it, sir? Are we going undercover?

06:49.917 --> 06:51.291
You're going caterers.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.458
But I thought we were here
to protect and serve?

06:54.542 --> 06:55.875
Oh, you are.

06:55.959 --> 06:58.834
You're going to protect the piñata.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.959
And you're going to serve the meatballs.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.041
Where are you going?

07:04.125 --> 07:07.000
Well, you don't protect a piñata

07:07.125 --> 07:08.208
without a bazooka.

07:12.291 --> 07:13.750
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

07:14.458 --> 07:16.458
I can't wait to beat, Milton.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.917
You're really working those legs hard.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.583
Feel the burn. Feel the burn!

07:24.375 --> 07:25.583
Mmm.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.041
Whoo!

07:27.125 --> 07:28.333
Spicy.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.500
All right, man,
I'm gonna take a five-minute break.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.000
And them I'm gonna get in
to this shish kabob.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.875
Rudy, the race is tomorrow.
Do you think you should train?

07:40.667 --> 07:42.000
It's walking.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.500
Winning's gonna be a piece of cake.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.625
Ah!

07:48.875 --> 07:50.125
Rudy, what happened?

07:50.208 --> 07:52.041
I just slipped on a piece of cake.

07:53.542 --> 07:56.375
Ah, there's my cake.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.750
I'm on a new fad diet.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.208
My wife's hiding baked goods all over town

08:02.291 --> 08:05.375
so I get my exercise.
It's called hide and go sleek.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.250
- Does it work?
- Nope.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.667
Jack, I think I sprained my ankle.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.750
You're gonna have to race for us.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.709
Well, I guess
I better start training then.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.417
Ow, ow.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.083
I'm off to train.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.083
Milton, do you really think
you can beat us?

08:25.166 --> 08:25.959
It's walking.

08:28.000 --> 08:28.834
Whoa!

08:28.917 --> 08:30.583
He is really fast.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.166
Yeah, he ate the shish right off my kabob.

08:38.542 --> 08:39.750
It's my birthday party

08:39.834 --> 08:42.000
and you've been swinging
at the piñata forever.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.250
Pipe down, birthday boy.

08:44.709 --> 08:47.667
I'm one swing away
from swimming in choco balls.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.625
All right, good luck, hon.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.125
This thing's made out of concrete.

09:00.542 --> 09:01.792
Here you go-- Oh!

09:07.875 --> 09:08.875
My candy! Mine!

09:08.959 --> 09:10.667
My candy! My candy! My candy!

09:10.750 --> 09:12.500
My candy! Mine! My candy!

09:12.583 --> 09:13.875
- Joan! Joan!
- My candy! My candy!

09:13.959 --> 09:15.250
My candy!

09:15.291 --> 09:16.625
- Joan! Joan!
- My-- what?

09:16.709 --> 09:18.917
Look, it's embarrassing enough
that they're using us as waiters,

09:19.000 --> 09:20.417
and now you're making
a fool out of yourself.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.542
I wasn't the one caught sucking the icing
off of the birthday cake.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.458
Yes, you were.

09:25.542 --> 09:26.625
Oh, yeah.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.041
We're mall cops
and Chief McGruder thinks we're a joke.

09:30.166 --> 09:33.417
We're the screaming skeletons.
Who's ready to rock?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.959
Ooh, who are these guys?

09:37.041 --> 09:39.041
Only the biggest band on the West Coast.

09:39.875 --> 09:43.750
Ah... I'm digging their vibe.

09:43.834 --> 09:47.000
These dudes are funky, fly, fresh.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.792
So you like them?

09:50.875 --> 09:53.291
I don't know.
I have no idea what I just said.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.500
All right, could the Mayor's son
come forward?

09:57.583 --> 10:00.000
We got a special surprise for him.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.917
Oh, I bet it's a pony.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.291
Nobody move, or the birthday boy gets it.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.917
It's not a pony. Not a pony.

10:10.041 --> 10:13.625
We're in control
and nobody is leaving this party

10:13.709 --> 10:15.834
until your daddy pays us.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.125
Yo, they took out the cops.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.750
Do you know what that means?

10:19.834 --> 10:21.041
We're Trevor's only hope.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.667
Poor kid doesn't stand a chance.

10:33.542 --> 10:34.750
What are we gonna do?

10:35.542 --> 10:36.917
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.041
- And that's panic.
- Okay.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.917
Okay, Jerry? We cannot freak out.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.542
- I know.
- Oo-oh.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.417
'Cause if we freak out, I'm telling you,

10:44.500 --> 10:45.542
that's when everything happens.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.542
So you look me in the eye.
You look at me, buddy!

10:47.667 --> 10:49.625
Buddy, look me right in the eye
and tell me you're not gonna panic!

10:49.709 --> 10:51.000
Say we're not gonna freak out!

10:53.458 --> 10:55.750
Grab those two behind the counter.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.625
See, Jerry, that's what happens
when you freak out.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.792
Listen up, Mayor. We have your son.

11:02.875 --> 11:07.834
And we want $25,000
or no one leaves this party.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.500
$25,000? That's chump change.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.291
This is the <i>Mayor's son.</i>

11:15.750 --> 11:17.375
Make it 50, copper.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.250
Why are you helping them?

11:20.291 --> 11:22.208
You wanna make it 70,000?

11:23.667 --> 11:24.917
Don't listen to 'em, Mayor.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.917
They're just a bunch of crazy thugs.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.750
Listen to 'em, Mayor.
They're a bunch of crazy thugs.

11:33.417 --> 11:36.667
My dad will never let you out of here
once you release everyone.

11:37.208 --> 11:41.625
Then we'll take you to our secret hideout.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.250
And the only way your daddy

11:43.333 --> 11:45.417
is gonna get to see you again

11:45.500 --> 11:50.000
is if he pays us another $50,000.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.959
Joan, they're taking Trevor.
We gotta do something.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.542
Agreed, we gotta get out of here.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.792
How does that help Trevor?

11:59.875 --> 12:00.917
Who?

12:01.709 --> 12:02.625
Oh, yeah, the boy.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.083
Forget that, follow me.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.250
Where do you think you're going?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.291
Uh...

12:08.375 --> 12:10.583
- We are caterers.
- We are.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.542
Who are late for our next event.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.291
Yeah, that's it. It's a...

12:15.375 --> 12:16.375
- <i>Bar mitzvah.</i>
- Dog show.

12:16.458 --> 12:17.375
Oh, no.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.542
A dog show and a <i>bar mitzvah?</i>

12:22.458 --> 12:26.166
Yes, that's right. It's a bark mitzvah.

12:26.417 --> 12:27.792
You're not going anywhere.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.125
Wha--

12:30.083 --> 12:31.208
Fine.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.917
But it's on you if there's
No <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>

12:33.000 --> 12:34.834
when that labradoodle becomes a man.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.959
<i>Rudy, do I really have to wear this?</i>

12:42.041 --> 12:43.875
Come on, it's part of the sport.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.375
Nobody's gonna make fun of you.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.750
Oh, man, you look dumb.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.291
I'm sorry, just thank you
so much for racing for me.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.709
We gotta win this and keep the wharf

12:59.834 --> 13:01.667
for hot lady stretching time.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.709
This may be the most important
competition of my life.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.959
That suit is aerodynamic
and one of a kind.

13:09.917 --> 13:10.959
Two of a kind.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.458
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.208
I got my helmet caught in the bus door.

13:15.959 --> 13:19.208
And my front door, and the dojo door,
And I don't even want to talk about the--

13:19.291 --> 13:20.375
Can we just start the race?

13:20.458 --> 13:21.709
- Yeah, we'll start the race.
- Oh, I'll start the race.

13:21.792 --> 13:22.709
Guys, guys!

13:22.792 --> 13:25.041
All right, all right, all right.
Excuse me, look out. Here we go.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.917
Boy, do you guys look dumb.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.500
I know, that's what I said.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.625
Okay, all right, yeah.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.875
All right, you boys remember the rules
of speed walking?

13:37.291 --> 13:39.000
One foot on the ground at all times

13:39.083 --> 13:40.250
and...

13:40.333 --> 13:41.625
Well, I guess that's about it.

13:43.875 --> 13:44.959
On your mark.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.291
Set!

13:52.333 --> 13:53.959
Is it me, or do they look a little--

13:54.000 --> 13:55.208
Ridiculous?

13:56.458 --> 13:58.208
Sure, let's go with ridiculous.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.291
Look, Joan.

14:05.417 --> 14:07.250
We may only be mall cops,

14:07.291 --> 14:08.750
but we're not running anymore.

14:08.834 --> 14:11.208
Okay, this kid needs us
and my plan is gonna work.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.166
All right.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.333
But, Jerry, if we don't make it out,

14:16.417 --> 14:18.166
I want you to tell Joe from the deli,

14:18.250 --> 14:20.917
Mike from the bank,
and Billy from the firehouse...

14:23.625 --> 14:25.792
...that I love them all

14:25.917 --> 14:27.792
and I would have married any one of them.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.875
Oh, yeah, and you might have
to explain who I am.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.375
<i>You've got the money.</i>

14:34.458 --> 14:36.000
<i>Now send out Trevor.</i>

14:37.583 --> 14:40.750
We'll send the kid out
after we count the money.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.250
Let's go.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.041
Throw a bag on this kid's head

14:49.125 --> 14:50.875
so he doesn't see where we're going.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.875
All right, let's do this.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.542
Hold up!

14:54.625 --> 14:57.166
You're not going anywhere.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.750
Joan Malone, mall cop.

15:01.542 --> 15:02.750
Why are you holding a cookie?

15:03.667 --> 15:05.625
Oh, hold on. Hold on, wait a second.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.000
Here-- all right.

15:08.083 --> 15:11.000
Joan Malone, mall cop!

15:11.083 --> 15:12.250
Yep, that's it.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.041
Jerry, now!

15:15.917 --> 15:16.959
Over there!

15:18.583 --> 15:20.083
Joan, you just hit me.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.000
Oh, sorry.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.417
Ow, still me.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.583
Forget it, Joan. We can't take 'em.
Let's get out of here.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.291
Looks like they ran.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.083
They're smarter than they look.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.917
All right, let's go.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.959
Grab the kid and the cake.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.667
But put it somewhere I can't find it.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.792
I'm on the hide and go sleek diet.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.750
Ow! Stop it! Ah!

16:26.625 --> 16:28.792
Hey, hey, hey! What are you guys doing?

16:28.875 --> 16:30.250
You're in the middle of a race.

16:33.750 --> 16:34.875
He's right.

16:36.542 --> 16:37.792
Look what we've become.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.291
Friends don't act like this.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.333
Do you want to just share the wharf?

16:46.291 --> 16:47.583
No!

16:47.667 --> 16:49.291
The wharf is mine!

17:04.291 --> 17:05.750
Listen up, everybody.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.250
And hot, new lady members.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.875
We're gonna be doing eight laps
around the wharf courtyard,

17:10.959 --> 17:12.792
then we're gonna take
a rest by the water fountains--

17:12.875 --> 17:14.083
Excuse me, look out. Hello.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.625
Whoa, ah, oh.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.959
Uh, Gross Bob, we're about
to start our walk here.

17:20.083 --> 17:23.834
Yeah, well the doctor said
I gotta come out here every single day.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.208
The vitamin D from the setting sun

17:26.291 --> 17:28.917
is the only way to dry out
the pus from my foot fungus.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.709
Holy Christmas nuts.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.375
Speed walking club is disbanded.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.667
Save yourselves!

17:43.083 --> 17:44.542
You guys were right.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.000
This is a perfect place
to air out my dogs.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.792
You are a genius, Rudy.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.917
I know.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.500
Get the Mayor on the phone.

18:00.583 --> 18:03.750
It's time to ask for another 50 grand.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.750
Ransom.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.792
What happened to Ronnie's voice?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.291
He sounds so manly.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.667
Manly like a woman.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.875
- It's that mall cop.
- That's right.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.792
I've been texting the cops
and they'll be here in...

18:20.875 --> 18:23.291
Three, two, one.

18:25.959 --> 18:27.458
Okay, looks like they're a little late.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.542
Uh, so...

18:29.625 --> 18:33.500
were you a band first
and then became criminals?

18:36.250 --> 18:37.959
- There they are!
- Oh, here they are.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.417
Stay back. I got the kid.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.000
Take one more step and he gets it.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.375
All right, hold on, guys.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.834
Whoa!

18:50.750 --> 18:52.625
The only one who's getting it is you.

18:55.792 --> 18:56.959
Take him away, boys.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.417
All right.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.709
You know, I think
I owe you two an apology.

19:05.583 --> 19:08.208
That was some very impressive police work.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.041
Uh, but where is Trevor?

19:11.125 --> 19:13.208
Oh, he's safe and sound back at Phil's.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.792
Yeah, when Joan distracted them
I turned the black lights on.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.417
Then we switched places with Trevor
and the skeleton guarding him.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.083
You left Trevor
with one of these skeletons?

19:20.166 --> 19:22.583
Oh, yeah, but I wouldn't
worry about it, sir.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.750
He's totally under control.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.750
I'm gonna get you, birthday boy.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.125
On behalf of the mayor's office

19:39.208 --> 19:41.291
and the entire city of Seaford,

19:41.417 --> 19:45.750
I am proud to present Joan Malone
and Jerry Martinez

19:45.834 --> 19:48.000
with these medals of valor.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.458
- Yeah, all right.
-

19:57.625 --> 19:59.291
All right, in closing we--

19:59.375 --> 20:00.834
Being a mall cop...

20:02.166 --> 20:03.959
is about putting others

20:04.041 --> 20:06.083
before yourself.

20:08.417 --> 20:13.083
Even as a small girl

20:15.667 --> 20:17.208
I dreamed of being a mall--

20:17.625 --> 20:18.667
I--

20:18.750 --> 20:20.917
Joan, Joan, Joan. You're ruining it.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.208
We finally get the respect
we deserve and you're losing it.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.417
You're right, you're right.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.667
Take us home, partner. Go on.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.458
Being a mall cop...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.625
Is about finding the positivity--

20:39.583 --> 20:40.875
Finding the--

20:48.250 --> 20:49.542
That is so true.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.709
All right, Joan, there was one piñata
left over from the party.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.041
The mayor said we can have it.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.417
You think you can open it?

21:07.792 --> 21:09.417
Don't worry, Jerry. I got this.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.166
I knew this bazooka would come in handy.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.792
Handy for candy.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.917
- Fire in the hole!
-

21:20.750 --> 21:22.542
- Not a dent.
- Reload!

21:25.208 --> 21:26.583
Fire in the hole!

21:56.875 --> 21:57.792
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.792
<i>Yes!</i>
