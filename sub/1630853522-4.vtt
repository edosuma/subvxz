I'm sure we can make an exception.

20:04.041 --> 20:06.666
-How did you know I was...
-My name is Waleed.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.833
Your great-grandmother's story
is of legend.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.750
When you're ready,
we have much to discuss.

20:16.541 --> 20:20.166
-Why is the hot and sour soup so red?
-That's the color it's supposed to be.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.625
Did you Americans find a way
to whitewash the Chinese food too?

20:24.208 --> 20:27.291
Tell me, was it difficult
finding a scarf long enough

20:27.416 --> 20:29.791
to cover that big mouth of yours?

20:29.875 --> 20:32.500
WALEED: For hundreds of years,
that scarf has protected the identity

20:32.583 --> 20:35.250
of warriors willing to take on
the mantle of the Red Dagger.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.083
Our function is simple.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.833
To protect our people
from threats of the unseen.

20:40.916 --> 20:42.000
Like <i>Djinn?</i>

20:42.083 --> 20:45.083
The Clandestines are not like the <i>Djinn</i>
you've heard about in stories

20:45.166 --> 20:46.666
or in religious texts.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.375
I mean, if Thor landed
in the Himalayan mountains,

20:49.458 --> 20:51.083
he too would have been called a <i>Djinn.</i>

20:51.750 --> 20:56.458
-So, what are they, and what am I?
-I'll show you.

20:58.833 --> 20:59.833
Come.

21:02.791 --> 21:05.791
The Clandestines and Aisha
are from another realm.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.375
This map shows you
how our two worlds co-exist.

21:20.916 --> 21:23.458
(WHIRRING)

21:30.291 --> 21:32.916
There are many dimensions around us
that we cannot see.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.375
This is just one of them.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.666
What is this?

21:40.750 --> 21:42.041
WALEED: Aisha's home.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.375
It's connected to our world but hidden.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.625
Behind the Veil of <i>Noor</i>
that separates our world from theirs.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.500
KAREEM: <i>Noor</i> is the energy source
of that realm.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.958
The Veil, the Clandestines.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.041
Even your powers are made of it.

21:57.291 --> 21:59.875
If the Clandestines use the bangle
to tear down the Veil,

22:00.375 --> 22:02.125
they'll unleash their world onto ours.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.000
Until there's nothing left of it.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.833
That is why it is important
to keep that bangle safe.

22:24.416 --> 22:25.708
I haven't seen that before.

22:26.416 --> 22:29.125
In all the years and everything
I've heard about that bangle,

22:29.208 --> 22:30.958
there was no mention of an inscription.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.375
Do you know what it says?

22:34.833 --> 22:37.416
It says, "What you seek is seeking you."

22:40.708 --> 22:43.583
Is that, like, an important message or...

22:44.291 --> 22:48.375
I don't know.
But it must've been important to someone.
