Huh, let me guess, you did him a favor.

09:38.313 --> 09:40.262
Lucifer helped me get my first show.

09:40.297 --> 09:41.792
He was a real inspiration.

09:41.827 --> 09:43.676
I try to reflect that in my art.

09:43.711 --> 09:45.807
Any idea who took a shot at you?

09:45.842 --> 09:46.675
Nope.

09:46.710 --> 09:49.303
No recent threats, nothing?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.797
Look, I'm no snitch.

09:51.832 --> 09:53.517
Even if I did know, I can't talk.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.446
I'm an artist.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.282
I process tragedy through my work.

09:56.339 --> 09:58.804
CHLOE: Would you prefer to process
tragedy back at the precinct?

09:58.839 --> 10:01.537
'Cause I have a holding cell that
could really use an artist's touch.

10:01.572 --> 10:03.355
Yes, Benny, that favor you owe me,

10:03.389 --> 10:05.624
I'm calling in my IOU.

10:05.736 --> 10:08.604
Answer the detective's questions.

10:10.896 --> 10:13.732
Hector clashed with some punks
in Latin Kings colors that night.

10:13.766 --> 10:15.928
We were at capacity, they wanted in.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.131
They were making threats, they were upset.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.991
And you didn't mention this
at the crime scene because...?

10:23.026 --> 10:25.006
BENNY: My fans aren't just buying shoes.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.583
They're buying Benny Choi.

10:26.618 --> 10:29.448
Artist, activist, man of the people.

10:29.483 --> 10:30.849
You know, I wore colors back in the day.

10:30.883 --> 10:32.441
Asian Boyz. I was low level.

10:32.476 --> 10:33.556
You know, a punk.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.081
Got out before the cops even knew my name.

10:35.155 --> 10:37.010
Ah, protecting your rep.

10:37.045 --> 10:39.583
Wouldn't want to risk that
seven-figure endorsement deal, would we?

10:39.618 --> 10:41.384
I didn't talk because if a Latin King hears

10:41.419 --> 10:44.583
an ex-Asian Boy done
dry-snitched him to the cops?

10:44.655 --> 10:47.349
Those thugs will retaliate on principle.

10:47.384 --> 10:48.739
I was trying to prevent more death.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.928
Well, aren't we the little saint?

10:50.963 --> 10:52.404
CHLOE: Latin Kings versus Asian Boyz.

10:52.438 --> 10:53.712
That really narrows it down.

10:53.747 --> 10:55.551
Did you get names?

10:58.613 --> 11:00.303
Diego, Dani, I don't know.

11:00.338 --> 11:01.637
A couple, I think.

11:01.672 --> 11:02.814
Joined at the hip.

11:02.848 --> 11:04.170
Mm-hmm.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.596
Diego and Dani. Right.

11:06.631 --> 11:09.466
You need to call me if
you remember anything else.

11:12.224 --> 11:13.677
Uh, yeah, I'll call.

11:13.712 --> 11:15.112
But be careful.

11:15.147 --> 11:17.073
Them Latin Kings about to raise hell.

11:17.108 --> 11:18.641
My "speciality."

11:18.719 --> 11:19.698
(chuckles)

11:19.732 --> 11:21.599
(snorting)

11:21.634 --> 11:23.969
CHLOE: Did it ever occur to you to
tell me that you're tight with Benny?

11:24.004 --> 11:26.353
That you gave one of your
favors to a former gang felon?

11:26.388 --> 11:28.506
Well, I've been giving
favors for thousands of years.

11:28.541 --> 11:29.753
Would you like a peek at my ledger?

11:29.788 --> 11:31.584
No, I'd like you to follow basic protocol.

11:31.619 --> 11:34.386
And I'd love to continue the debate
on our opposing views of police work,

11:34.421 --> 11:35.539
so how about we hit the cop bar,

11:35.574 --> 11:37.513
and get dangerous with
some bottom shelf, huh?

11:37.548 --> 11:39.282
A girl's dead and you
want to go on a pub crawl.

11:39.317 --> 11:40.570
Oh, liquid courage.

11:40.605 --> 11:43.638
I hear the Paddock Lounge is every
new detective's rite of passage.

11:43.707 --> 11:46.074
Forget it. We need to wait
for an I.D. on those kids.

11:46.109 --> 11:48.994
150,000 active gang members in L.A.,

11:49.029 --> 11:49.820
it could take awhile.

11:49.855 --> 11:52.704
Oh, you're right. No time
for a quick drink, then.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.778
We're on duty.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.938
You are the oldest young
person I've ever met!

11:56.019 --> 11:58.987
And coming from an immortal,
that's saying something.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.177
Look, I'm not gonna drink at
a bar where everyone hates me.

12:04.212 --> 12:07.361
Did you ever consider they
hate you for that very reason?

12:07.396 --> 12:08.947
Yeah, they hate me for several reasons.

12:08.981 --> 12:11.314
Well, don't let those
Philistines inhibit your right

12:11.349 --> 12:14.113
to toast our first break
in the case... come on!

12:14.148 --> 12:15.032
It's the least you could do.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.888
- (sighs)
- Besides, you know, I...

12:16.923 --> 12:19.046
need something to dull the pain.

12:19.081 --> 12:22.007
Ugh! If I say yes, will
you shut up about the leg?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.638
No promises.

12:23.673 --> 12:26.665
Ooh! Aah! (muttering)

12:26.699 --> 12:29.100
♪ ♪

12:29.424 --> 12:31.202

12:31.301 --> 12:33.138

12:34.857 --> 12:36.270

12:36.305 --> 12:37.392
MAN 2: Who's the hell's that guy?

12:37.427 --> 12:38.610
Want me to lose this guy?

12:38.644 --> 12:40.812
(rock music playing in background)

12:43.426 --> 12:44.637
It's Italian wool.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.833
Touch it. I know you want to.

12:47.453 --> 12:48.687
Go on.

12:50.576 --> 12:52.644
Yeah. That'll do.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.915
(clears throat) Well, somebody's not
being crowned homecoming queen, are they?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.526
Yeah. Order. Please.

12:58.561 --> 12:59.578
Right.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.070
Uh, two shots of your
finest swill, please, love.

13:02.105 --> 13:04.902
- WOMAN: You got it.
- I'll have a water.

13:06.239 --> 13:07.706
So, about this whole favor thing.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.554
What... what is it?

13:09.630 --> 13:11.545
What are you, some kind of loan shark?

13:11.580 --> 13:13.816
Con man? Godfather with a twist?

13:13.851 --> 13:16.581
But surely you've heard the expression...

13:17.340 --> 13:18.266
"Deal with the Devil"?

13:18.301 --> 13:19.951
- Mm!
- Come on, give me a break.

13:19.986 --> 13:21.396
No, people come to me to ask for favors,

13:21.431 --> 13:23.652
and more often than
not, I'm happy to oblige.

13:23.733 --> 13:24.711
What do <i>you</i> get?

13:24.746 --> 13:26.582
Well, sometimes, I have something in mind,

13:26.617 --> 13:27.737
but, usually, like with Benny,

13:27.772 --> 13:30.528
it's simply to be repaid at a later date.

13:30.571 --> 13:32.893
A devilish IOU, if you will.

13:32.991 --> 13:35.020
Who would take a deal like that?

13:35.597 --> 13:37.264
They <i>all</i> do.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.080
Palmetto Bitch.

13:44.564 --> 13:47.925
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell.

13:48.347 --> 13:49.784
(sighs heavily)

13:49.819 --> 13:52.256
That's Anthony Paolucci.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.171
He's partners with the guy who took
a bullet in the Palmetto case...

13:55.206 --> 13:55.956
Malcolm Graham.

13:55.991 --> 13:58.784
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.769
Malcolm got shot meeting
with some gangsters,

14:00.804 --> 14:03.528
and... Paolucci thinks he took the bullet

14:03.563 --> 14:06.406
like a hero; I think he was on the take.

14:06.491 --> 14:08.970
Aha! So you're a snitch.

14:09.035 --> 14:11.624
A nog. No wonder nobody likes you.

14:11.659 --> 14:13.178
Yeah, you'd think I was guilty of a crime.

14:13.267 --> 14:15.541
Yeah, you know what they say:
"Snitches end up in ditches."

14:15.643 --> 14:16.937
Oh, thanks, man.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.305
I feel so much better.

14:18.340 --> 14:19.208
Hm!

14:19.243 --> 14:20.800
No, I don't know, I just...

14:20.835 --> 14:22.965
was following my gut, I guess.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.950
Caught in the crosshairs
of another man's crime.

14:25.004 --> 14:26.767
I don't need your sympathy, but thank you.

14:26.802 --> 14:27.601
Fair enough.

14:27.636 --> 14:29.888
Still, no excuse for that man's rudeness.

14:29.922 --> 14:31.331
No, no, no, no... I can handle Paolucci.

14:31.366 --> 14:32.924
I don't need you to stand up for me.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.492
Understood.

14:36.945 --> 14:38.217
Excuse me.

14:38.526 --> 14:39.883
Hello.

14:39.918 --> 14:41.023
- What do you want?
- Well, firstly,

14:41.058 --> 14:42.152
let me state that I'm in no way

14:42.187 --> 14:44.780
standing up for my
associate, Detective Decker.

14:44.848 --> 14:47.305
But on behalf of myself, and only myself,

14:47.340 --> 14:49.474
I think you're a complete sack of ass.

14:49.508 --> 14:51.142
(grunts, men murmuring)

14:52.211 --> 14:54.746
Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.

14:59.118 --> 15:02.047
♪ ♪

15:02.104 --> 15:03.417
And your name?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.256
Mazikeen.

15:05.974 --> 15:08.004
How do you spell that?

15:08.090 --> 15:10.121
Surprise me.

15:11.966 --> 15:14.468
Interesting choice of venue.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.689
What, are you trying
to throw me off-balance?

15:16.724 --> 15:20.251
Because I'm much more comfortable
among humans than you might think.

15:20.913 --> 15:22.944
So I see.

15:26.445 --> 15:29.299
This is my favorite place in the city.

15:29.334 --> 15:30.282
Really?

15:30.352 --> 15:31.803
Look at them on their laptops,

15:31.879 --> 15:33.862
writing the next great screenplay,

15:33.951 --> 15:36.373
torturing themselves with dreams they know,

15:36.408 --> 15:39.910
deep down, they will never achieve.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.828
Reminds me of home.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.671
Get to the point.

15:45.965 --> 15:48.096
I want to go back.

15:48.557 --> 15:50.692
Then give me something, Maze.

15:50.876 --> 15:52.749
Give me something that I
can use against Lucifer,

15:52.830 --> 15:54.609
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

15:54.644 --> 15:55.874
That's the problem.

15:55.908 --> 15:58.283
He doesn't confide in me anymore.

15:58.841 --> 15:59.874
But...

16:00.291 --> 16:04.237
there is someone he
does talk to... a doctor.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.248
And I bet she would love
that ridiculous suit.

16:08.566 --> 16:11.482
And here I thought you
were the loyal soldier.

16:11.550 --> 16:14.170
I want what's best for Lucifer.

16:14.662 --> 16:16.848
Same thing you want.

16:17.259 --> 16:19.590
Then tell me about this doctor...

16:21.723 --> 16:24.054
..."Mike."

16:32.522 --> 16:33.889
(distant siren wailing)

16:38.013 --> 16:39.380
(wings whoosh, flap in distance)

16:42.050 --> 16:43.350
Hello?

16:43.515 --> 16:46.150
Is anybody there?

16:52.576 --> 16:54.597
I know Krav Maga!

17:05.272 --> 17:07.508
(wings whoosh, flap)

17:07.541 --> 17:09.210
(palm fronds rustling)

17:10.612 --> 17:12.313
(gasps)

17:12.347 --> 17:13.194
(sighs anxiously)

17:13.230 --> 17:15.121
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

17:15.156 --> 17:17.044
How did you get in here?

17:17.096 --> 17:18.763
I have a key.

17:20.116 --> 17:21.526
Yeah, let me start over.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.858
Uh, I actually just moved
into the office next-door.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.121
I'm Dr. Canaan.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.920
(laughing): Oh, okay.

17:28.955 --> 17:30.733
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda.

17:30.768 --> 17:33.139
Uh, Dr. Martin.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.769
(chuckles)

17:37.939 --> 17:39.874
(dance music playing)

17:39.908 --> 17:41.731
It's fantastic, actually.

17:41.766 --> 17:43.099
The thrill of fighting humans

17:43.134 --> 17:46.002
has taken on a whole new spin,
now that I might get hurt.

17:46.037 --> 17:49.805
Although, sadly, the only thing broken
was that incontinent troll's nose.

17:49.898 --> 17:52.825
- Your behavior is foolish.
- Oh, come on!

17:52.860 --> 17:54.855
You used to love danger.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.966
Since when did Hell's favorite
torturer become my mother?

17:58.001 --> 17:59.454
You're changing.

17:59.489 --> 18:01.037
Becoming vulnerable.

18:01.139 --> 18:03.597
Maybe even... (whispers): mortal.

18:03.678 --> 18:05.489
Mm!

18:06.959 --> 18:10.010
If I'm not going to look
out for you, who will? Hmm?

18:10.086 --> 18:12.106
- Your pet cop?
- That's what partners are for.

18:12.141 --> 18:14.415
She is not your partner.

18:14.504 --> 18:16.939
Have you two been talking?

18:18.742 --> 18:20.815
(chuckles)

18:20.849 --> 18:24.698
You know, I actually don't think it's
my mortality that you're worried about.

18:24.794 --> 18:28.883
You're just jealous that I'm
exploring it with Detective Decker.

18:28.996 --> 18:30.129
(sets bottle down)

18:31.784 --> 18:33.860
Jealous of a mortal woman?

18:33.988 --> 18:35.558
- Mm-hmm.
- (scoffing laugh)

18:35.641 --> 18:37.219
I don't think so.

18:37.254 --> 18:39.894
But if you insist on
continuing this exploration,

18:39.929 --> 18:42.147
maybe next time, I won't
be around to save your ass.

18:42.241 --> 18:43.526
Mm! Well, that <i>is</i> a shame.

18:43.561 --> 18:46.074
'Cause you and my backside
used to get on very well.

18:46.109 --> 18:48.067
My front side, as well, actually.

18:48.102 --> 18:49.085
Things change, Lucifer.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.811
Yes, but you don't, Maze.

18:52.414 --> 18:54.781
You exist to protect me.

18:54.816 --> 18:57.811
To know where I am and
who I'm with at all times,

18:57.846 --> 19:00.369
whether you want to, or not.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.304
Pretty sure your name's not on the list.

19:13.389 --> 19:14.789
It should be.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.734
Considering I've just spent
the last couple of hours

19:16.815 --> 19:19.674
convincing Anthony Paolucci
not to press charges.

19:19.708 --> 19:20.608
(wry laugh)

19:20.642 --> 19:22.131
Well, what if I want to press charges?

19:22.175 --> 19:24.011
- For what?
- Stupidity.

19:24.046 --> 19:26.913
A drunk, on-duty cop...
surely that's a no-no.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.724
But don't worry, I'm feeling charitable.

19:28.774 --> 19:30.924
I'll let it slide this time.

19:31.324 --> 19:32.530
(sultry purr)

19:32.565 --> 19:34.433
Is it my thanks you want, or a kiss?

19:34.468 --> 19:36.264
I don't want your thanks.

19:36.299 --> 19:38.759
Because I don't do
favors for guys like you.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.065
I did this for Chloe.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.886
Oh, stop raining on
the poor woman's parade.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.634
It's about time she got
some spark in her life.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.683
Spark?

19:49.729 --> 19:51.395
How about real danger?

19:51.430 --> 19:55.131
Do you have any idea how easy a gang
vendetta can spiral out of control?

19:55.207 --> 19:58.174
Well, I'm trying my best to find out. Yeah.

19:58.209 --> 20:00.109
That's exactly why I'm here.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.787
Chloe is the mother of
my child, you imbecile.

20:04.385 --> 20:06.435
You want to work this case?

20:06.989 --> 20:08.782
Take care of her.

20:09.191 --> 20:11.764
Sir, yes, sir.

20:19.246 --> 20:22.982
(man rapping in Spanish)

20:23.823 --> 20:24.905
CHLOE: <i>Okay, Latin Kings turf.</i>

20:24.940 --> 20:26.534
<i>You need to have my back on this.</i>

20:26.621 --> 20:28.434
LUCIFER: <i>You can count
on me, Detective.</i>

20:28.469 --> 20:30.945
All right, Dani and Diego Ramirez.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.015
Married straight out
of juvie; real hotheads.

20:33.050 --> 20:34.649
Ooh! Do we get to kick in the door?

20:34.683 --> 20:37.451
As your self-sacrificing
partner, I volunteer to go first.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.099
No, there'll be no kicking in of anything,

20:39.134 --> 20:40.286
unless we have a warrant,

20:40.321 --> 20:42.686
or people are in immediate danger.

20:42.964 --> 20:44.912
You better start taking
this case seriously.

20:44.983 --> 20:46.405
If this escalates to a gang war...

20:46.440 --> 20:48.356
Yes, yes, it could spiral out of control...

20:48.391 --> 20:50.507
blood could run in the
streets, fire could rain down.

20:50.573 --> 20:52.663
You sound just like your ex.

20:53.237 --> 20:55.052
What do you mean... you spoke to Dan?

20:55.087 --> 20:55.885
Mm!

20:55.920 --> 20:57.383
He dropped by Lux.

20:57.418 --> 20:59.231
Kept rambling on about keeping you safe.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.521
Quite condescending, if you ask me.

21:01.623 --> 21:03.502
What is it with the men in my life?

21:03.537 --> 21:06.372
I'm a man in your life?

Act like a child, get treated like a child.

21:16.641 --> 21:20.595
Wha...? Isn't it illegal to
leave your child locked in a car?

21:20.629 --> 21:23.097
(dogs barking in distance)

21:23.131 --> 21:26.968
(rock music playing inside)

21:32.548 --> 21:35.512
Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD.

21:35.638 --> 21:37.494
Need to ask you a few questions.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.630

21:41.450 --> 21:43.357
LAPD! Open up!

21:43.392 --> 21:45.061
Come on, baby.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.231
Let me make you feel better.

21:48.351 --> 21:50.085

21:52.194 --> 21:54.295

22:01.039 --> 22:02.096
DANI: Who the hell are you?!

22:02.131 --> 22:03.864
DIEGO: What are you doing here?!

22:04.732 --> 22:07.234
What are you doing in my house, man?!

22:08.720 --> 22:10.429
How the hell did you get out of the car?

22:10.464 --> 22:11.960
Child's play, and good thing I did.

22:12.032 --> 22:13.685
There was immediate danger.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.259
He was about to leave this
woman completely unsatisfied.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.054
- What the...?!
- CHLOE: Hey! Hey!

22:18.089 --> 22:19.907
- Down.
- He's your partner?

22:19.942 --> 22:21.663
Yeah, don't get me started.

22:21.698 --> 22:23.383
DANI: Cops harass us no matter what we do!

22:23.418 --> 22:25.428
And now they're breaking into our house?!

22:25.513 --> 22:26.757
I should sue that pervert!

22:26.792 --> 22:27.742
You have my blessing.

22:27.777 --> 22:29.315
But first, let's talk Benny Choi.

22:29.350 --> 22:32.092
Yes, did you attempt to use him
as target practice the other night?

22:32.127 --> 22:32.851
- That wasn't us!
- No.

22:32.886 --> 22:35.373
Okay, well, witnesses said they
heard you making threats at the door.

22:35.408 --> 22:37.150
DIEGO: No, we-we just wanted in.

22:37.185 --> 22:38.740
We wanted a pair of Benny's sweet kicks.

22:38.799 --> 22:41.432
Enough to pay for them
with Paola Cortez's blood?

22:41.467 --> 22:43.400
Paola was Diego's cousin, okay?

22:43.435 --> 22:45.154
It's wack what happened to her.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.730
Why do you think he's so upset?

22:49.565 --> 22:51.959
I promised I'd get her in the show.

22:52.040 --> 22:56.529
There wasn't enough room for
three, so... we gave her our spot.

22:57.422 --> 22:58.904
She wanted to be a designer.

22:58.939 --> 23:01.450
Sorry, is that, is that flop sweat

23:01.485 --> 23:02.489
or is that a tear?

23:02.523 --> 23:05.041
That's... Oh...

23:05.076 --> 23:06.187
Oh, bloody hell.

23:06.222 --> 23:07.557
This is our bad guy?

23:07.592 --> 23:09.777
No wonder he can't get it up.

23:10.778 --> 23:12.546
Look, uh...

23:12.581 --> 23:14.034
if you didn't take a shot at Benny,

23:14.068 --> 23:17.334
then help us get justice for Paola.

23:18.004 --> 23:20.161
Tell us what you know, all right?

23:23.956 --> 23:27.090
If anyone had beef with
Benny Choi, it's Yellow Viper.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.281
LUCIFER: "Yellow Viper"?

23:28.316 --> 23:29.996
(laughs) Sounds like a venereal disease.

23:30.031 --> 23:32.814
DANI: He got out of jail a
few nights before Benny's show.

23:32.849 --> 23:35.342
He was a big-deal graffiti artist,
ran with Benny back in the day,

23:35.416 --> 23:37.364
then took the fall on some B&E.

23:37.399 --> 23:39.806
He got five and change, while
Benny got rich and famous.

23:39.841 --> 23:43.953
Well, it does sound like this Viper
fellow has every reason to punish Benny.

23:43.988 --> 23:45.595
We need to present a unified front.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.363
Speculate later, not in front of them.

23:47.398 --> 23:48.368
Got it.

23:48.582 --> 23:51.450
So, Viper's beef killed
your cousin then, eh?

23:52.024 --> 23:53.223
What? That wasn't speculation.

23:53.258 --> 23:54.768
That was a statement of potential fact.

23:54.803 --> 23:55.972
And if we ever run into him,

23:56.037 --> 23:57.789
he won't have to worry about no cops.

23:57.828 --> 23:59.753
LUCIFER: So you're just gonna
sit around and wait for revenge?

23:59.788 --> 24:01.014
That's rather lazy.

24:01.049 --> 24:02.647
Okay, this is the opposite of helping.

24:02.682 --> 24:04.251
What? I was promised a gang war.

24:04.285 --> 24:06.386
Instead I get a cry baby. This is boring.

24:06.505 --> 24:07.220
All right, tough.

24:07.255 --> 24:10.090
Right now, we need to warn Benny
that his buddy Viper's back in town.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.890
My apologies for him.

24:15.793 --> 24:17.830

No, from Benny.

your old friend Yellow Viper

25:22.924 --> 25:24.965
was released from prison last week?

25:25.103 --> 25:26.757
No, I had no idea he was out.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.119
No phone calls? No contact?

25:29.154 --> 25:31.338
I sent him letters when
he was inside San Quentin.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.251
Money for lawyers, too.

25:33.318 --> 25:34.963
But he sent the letters back all torn up.

25:34.998 --> 25:36.525
Didn't take a dime.

how things turned out.

25:39.161 --> 25:40.397
How I got lucky.

25:40.432 --> 25:42.028
Viper went down.

25:42.150 --> 25:42.918
He was my best friend...

25:42.953 --> 25:45.470
Well, with friends like
that, I'd hide the knives.

25:45.505 --> 25:47.183
Yeah, Viper must've snuck into my show.

25:47.276 --> 25:48.927
He fired those shots.

25:48.962 --> 25:51.201
Killing Pig Diddy was a message.

25:51.236 --> 25:54.248
All right, we'll get a squad
car to watch your house tonight.

25:54.283 --> 25:55.683
Viper comes by, you'll be safe.

Oh, after five years behind

27:19.220 --> 27:23.584
You know, I've been thinking about
that favor that you gave Benny.

27:23.679 --> 27:26.154
Did it also involve getting
him off on the felony B&E charge

27:26.189 --> 27:27.762
that put Viper in prison instead?

27:27.845 --> 27:30.357
Well, I may have pulled

27:30.391 --> 27:31.673
Well, if Viper hadn't have gone to prison,

27:31.708 --> 27:33.760
he wouldn't have targeted
Benny and shot up his show,

27:33.795 --> 27:35.802
which means Paola Cortez
would still be alive.

27:35.837 --> 27:38.423
Wait, you're not seriously
blaming me for that girl's death?

27:38.458 --> 27:39.274

29:12.997 --> 29:14.261
You know, if you spent as much time

29:14.296 --> 29:16.458
appealing to suspects
as you do annoying me,

29:16.493 --> 29:19.146
- (cars approaching)
- things might go...

29:19.263 --> 29:21.212
go a lot faster.

29:21.545 --> 29:22.569
(tires screeching)

29:24.038 --> 29:26.039
(hip-hop music throbbing
from sound system)

29:31.379 --> 29:34.715
(man rapping in Spanish)

29:37.038 --> 29:37.965
Our lucky day.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.469
Viper and the perv.

29:39.504 --> 29:43.055
LUCIFER: Bravo, crybaby.
This is a bold move, isn't it?

29:43.090 --> 29:45.133
CHLOE: Come on, turn around.

29:45.168 --> 29:47.115
If you walk away now, no
one has to get arrested.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.178
No one has to get hurt...

29:48.213 --> 29:49.888
Yeah, they do. Viper killed my cousin.

29:49.923 --> 29:52.166
- I'm here to get justice!
- LUCIFER: As you should.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.176
Are you insane? Shut up.

29:54.211 --> 29:55.585
What?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.374
Please, I promise we're dealing with this.

29:57.409 --> 30:01.542
You and your perv partner want to get
caught in the crossfire, cop, be my guest.

30:01.576 --> 30:02.628
(guns cocking)

30:02.663 --> 30:04.707
MAN: Smoke this piece!

30:09.584 --> 30:11.085
Enough danger for you yet?

30:11.154 --> 30:12.545
YOUNG MAN: Just stay there. Stay there.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.351
MAN: I'm curious.

30:17.757 --> 30:18.856
Right.

30:25.793 --> 30:28.207
This ain't about you, it's about Viper!

30:29.760 --> 30:30.925
Hey, now if you'd just give
that gun I'd asked for...

30:30.960 --> 30:32.848
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

30:33.772 --> 30:35.243
Diego?

30:35.682 --> 30:38.092
Diego, put down your weapon.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.769
Don't listen to her.

30:39.858 --> 30:40.763
This isn't what you want.

30:40.845 --> 30:43.545
Taking down Viper is exactly what he wants.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.514
We're doing it for Paola! Step off!

30:47.053 --> 30:48.271
I said step off!

30:48.306 --> 30:49.704
You know, as the Master of Punishment,

30:49.739 --> 30:52.055
I completely understand
your desire to make Viper pay

30:52.090 --> 30:53.695
for the tragic death of your cousin...

30:53.730 --> 30:55.898
Lucifer, you do remember
that bullets hurt, right?

30:56.012 --> 30:59.541
And furthermore, you do seem to
have this danger thing down pat,

30:59.625 --> 31:00.546
don't you?

31:00.581 --> 31:02.258
I mean the Devil could
learn a thing or two.

31:02.293 --> 31:03.705
DANI: The Devil? The
hell you talking about?

31:03.740 --> 31:05.194
LUCIFER: So, answer me this:

31:05.229 --> 31:08.575
So, you engage in turf wars, yet
nobody actually owns any turf?

31:08.672 --> 31:09.749
DIEGO: Get back, freak!

31:09.784 --> 31:10.851
All right, let's finish this.

31:10.886 --> 31:13.863
And-and those trousers. I
mean, you wear them so low that,

31:13.898 --> 31:15.600
well, your ass is exposed
to other naughty men,

31:15.668 --> 31:17.397
and we all know what kind
of danger that can bring,

31:17.432 --> 31:19.608
don't we? I mean, you can
park your bike in there.

31:19.643 --> 31:21.230
You making fun of his pants, yo?

31:21.265 --> 31:22.733
Well, are we talking pants or trousers?

31:22.768 --> 31:24.930
Because it's very confusing.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.511
Where'd he go?

31:28.462 --> 31:30.721
- Oh, dear.
- DIEGO: Don't matter.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.824
I'll kill you first.

31:33.803 --> 31:35.331
(switches clicking)

31:35.366 --> 31:36.078
- MAN: Hey, what's happening?
- (men clamoring)

31:36.113 --> 31:38.746
- (grunting)
- Where's Viper?

31:38.781 --> 31:41.554
You had your hero moment... stay
down, or you're gonna get shot!

31:41.589 --> 31:43.323
LUCIFER: Indeed!

31:46.679 --> 31:48.357
What's that? What happened?

31:48.391 --> 31:51.126
(men grunting)

31:51.435 --> 31:53.851
What the hell is happening?

31:55.442 --> 31:56.809
(sharp crack, man yells)

31:57.867 --> 31:59.101
Maze is happening.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.227
Your bartender's a ninja?

32:00.262 --> 32:01.730
- Of course she is.
- Yeah.

32:01.765 --> 32:03.572
What's that?

32:03.606 --> 32:05.439
(man shouts, grunts)

32:05.474 --> 32:07.299
Shattered tibia.

32:07.948 --> 32:10.412
Ooh, ouch... orbital fracture.

32:10.446 --> 32:12.048
(grunting)

32:12.083 --> 32:15.664
It was first perfected
in the hellfires of Tyre.

32:16.486 --> 32:17.419
(cracking)

32:17.453 --> 32:20.222
Oh, the humerus crush! (laughs)

32:20.256 --> 32:23.189
- (men groaning)
- LUCIFER: Love that Maze!

32:31.567 --> 32:32.501
(Diego yelling)

32:32.535 --> 32:33.669
(gun clatters away)

32:38.457 --> 32:40.108
(groans)

32:41.239 --> 32:42.395
(Maze and men moaning, grunting)

32:42.430 --> 32:45.047
(applauding) Oh, bravo, Detective.

32:45.081 --> 32:46.948
(chuckles)

32:49.254 --> 32:50.552
Ass saved.

32:50.586 --> 32:51.553
You're welcome.

32:51.588 --> 32:54.474
His ass, not yours.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.467
(gangsters groaning)

33:07.983 --> 33:09.620
(clicking)

33:09.655 --> 33:10.848
Let's go.

33:18.047 --> 33:19.715
Care to tell me what happened?

33:19.749 --> 33:20.924
(sighs)

33:20.990 --> 33:23.210
You wouldn't believe me if I did.

33:24.464 --> 33:26.899
They found a gun in Viper's bag.

33:27.113 --> 33:30.526
CHLOE: It's a .38. Same
caliber fired at Benny's show.

33:31.613 --> 33:32.894
Um...

33:32.929 --> 33:34.080
What?

33:34.214 --> 33:35.892
You should know something.

33:35.927 --> 33:36.532
Okay.

33:36.567 --> 33:38.433
I talked to Lucifer
about you the other day.

33:38.523 --> 33:39.976
Yeah, I heard.

33:40.058 --> 33:41.746
I mean, not that it got me anywhere.

33:41.781 --> 33:45.082
If anyone can handle themselves
around that wack job, it's you.

33:45.808 --> 33:47.743
And, hey, it looks like, uh...

33:47.972 --> 33:49.894
you got the bad guy.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.015
Yeah.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.244
Looks like.

34:09.992 --> 34:11.800
What, no "thank you"?

34:12.518 --> 34:13.637
I don't know why you're upset.

34:13.715 --> 34:15.603
I helped save kids.

34:15.692 --> 34:16.838
And we arrested our shooter.

34:16.873 --> 34:18.364
One might say I did you a favor.

34:18.399 --> 34:19.551
Hmm.

34:19.585 --> 34:22.308
Yeah, I think I just figured
it out, why you do these favors.

34:22.342 --> 34:24.324
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

34:24.359 --> 34:25.675
It's about power.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.120
It makes you feel superior.

34:27.155 --> 34:28.429
In control.

34:28.464 --> 34:30.897
You're addicted to creating chaos
and seeing where the chips fall,

34:30.931 --> 34:32.687
to hell with the consequences.

34:32.761 --> 34:35.460
It's like you have some
kind of god complex.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.536
I most certainly do not.

34:37.572 --> 34:39.915
You do a favor for one
person, someone else suffers.

34:39.949 --> 34:41.429
When you gave Benny that favor,

34:41.464 --> 34:42.840
you damned Viper to prison.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.056
Twice.

34:44.130 --> 34:46.370
Whether he's guilty or not.

34:53.409 --> 34:55.811
♪ ♪

34:57.032 --> 34:59.267
(Yellow Viper sighs deeply)

35:05.436 --> 35:06.216
What?

35:06.251 --> 35:07.157
Stop staring.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.451
You're having another one of
those "gut feelings," aren't you?

35:09.486 --> 35:11.498
Like you had on the Palmetto case.

35:11.624 --> 35:13.234
This has nothing to do with Palmetto.

35:13.269 --> 35:14.201
Au contraire.

35:14.236 --> 35:15.818
I think it has everything to do with it.

35:15.853 --> 35:18.102
See? Addicted to creating
chaos, talking out of your ass...

35:18.162 --> 35:20.022
Like I said: you were
trusting your instincts

35:20.057 --> 35:22.936
on that case, just like
you're trusting them now.

35:22.971 --> 35:27.943
I mean, why would a seasoned parolee
bring a gun to a children's art class?

35:27.978 --> 35:29.377
For all we know, Mr. Viper is innocent.

35:29.459 --> 35:32.314
I am innocent, man!

35:32.348 --> 35:33.289
See?

35:33.324 --> 35:35.114
What do you know? Our suspect has ears.

35:35.149 --> 35:38.142
Let's see if he has a
conscience, as well, shall we?

35:38.177 --> 35:39.354
Mr. Viper.

35:39.389 --> 35:41.495
Mr. Viper...

35:42.141 --> 35:43.492
Hello.

35:43.526 --> 35:46.358
You've already wasted so much of your life.

35:46.689 --> 35:50.201
What do you desire to do with
the rest of your time on Earth?

35:50.979 --> 35:53.123
All I want to do is my art.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.520
I swear I didn't shoot up Benny's show.

35:56.555 --> 36:00.972
If I hated him so much, why would
I bother to go after him and miss?

36:01.140 --> 36:02.674
Oh.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.936
Yes, he's got a point, actually.

36:05.010 --> 36:07.525
I mean, to pop off in a crowd
like that and not hit anyone,

36:07.560 --> 36:10.162
he'd have to be the
worst shot in the world.

36:10.515 --> 36:12.510
Or the best.

36:14.724 --> 36:15.910
(tires screeching)

36:15.992 --> 36:18.225
Steady on, Detective.

36:25.510 --> 36:27.222
It's my Pig Diddy piece.

36:27.257 --> 36:29.982
Collector in Dubai
offered me 150 G's for it.

36:30.052 --> 36:31.457
I want you to have it.

36:31.492 --> 36:33.212
As thanks for saving my life.

36:33.247 --> 36:34.083
Again.

36:34.118 --> 36:35.625
(exhales)

36:35.660 --> 36:38.528
Yes, my favor really did pay
off for you, didn't it, Benny?

36:38.606 --> 36:39.808
You're a huge star.

36:39.843 --> 36:41.218
(laughs)

36:41.253 --> 36:44.488
But if there's one thing the
Devil abhors, it's a fake.

36:44.523 --> 36:46.119
What are you talking about?

36:46.154 --> 36:47.508
I'm all about authenticity.

36:47.570 --> 36:50.164
Sure. Except for the lying.

36:50.199 --> 36:53.264
You failed to inform me that in
getting you off the B&E charge,

36:53.334 --> 36:56.214
suspicion would immediately
fall on your best friend.

36:56.249 --> 36:57.947
I had no control over that.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.446
VIPER: Didn't you?

36:59.598 --> 37:01.398
Oh...

37:02.234 --> 37:03.456
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

37:03.491 --> 37:04.875
I missed you, bro.

37:04.910 --> 37:06.827
That why you never came
to visit me in prison?

37:06.862 --> 37:08.106
BENNY: I wish I could've done more.

37:08.141 --> 37:10.719
Framing him for shooting up your
fashion show surely didn't help.

37:10.754 --> 37:11.973
CHLOE: Viper was always the real talent.

37:12.075 --> 37:14.753
When you heard he was getting released,
you tried to take down the competition

37:14.788 --> 37:16.366
before he could take down you.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.269
- (Benny scoffs)
- Planned a simple frame job.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.398
Parole violation that would
send Viper back to prison.

37:20.433 --> 37:23.142
But when Paola Cortez died, you
had to improvise, didn't you?

37:23.177 --> 37:26.483
You knew pointing the fingers at Latin
Kings would eventually get back to me.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.721
How the hell could I have
staged that frame job?

37:28.756 --> 37:30.974
How could I have pointed a gun at myself?

37:31.075 --> 37:32.559
Because you didn't pull the trigger.

37:32.646 --> 37:34.833
So many bullets fired into that crowd.

37:34.868 --> 37:36.917
How did no one get hit?

37:36.952 --> 37:38.269
That takes precision.

37:38.304 --> 37:41.000
CHLOE: I saw your Marine
tattoo when I met you, Hector.

37:41.086 --> 37:43.548
A heart in crosshairs. Sniper unit.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.997
Best marksmen in the world.

37:46.082 --> 37:50.200
Did you know firing a gun
into a crowd is a felony?

37:50.302 --> 37:52.055
You're responsible for Paola's murder.

37:52.090 --> 37:55.493
Unless, of course, you were
just doing someone a favor.

37:55.613 --> 37:59.674
- No, man. Hey...
- Benny made me do it! I'll testify, man.

37:59.756 --> 38:01.539
He told me he'd make me a partner.

38:01.574 --> 38:05.221
But then he made me plant the gun on Viper.

38:06.279 --> 38:08.414
And kill Pig Diddy.

38:10.148 --> 38:11.918
I loved that pig, man.

38:11.953 --> 38:12.822
Oh...

38:12.857 --> 38:16.020
Well, the good news is that
whilst all dogs go to Heaven,

38:16.143 --> 38:19.781
you'd be surprised how many
pigs are waiting for you in Hell.

38:19.816 --> 38:21.256
CHLOE: Okay, let's go.

38:21.319 --> 38:22.360
You were never good as me, man.

38:22.423 --> 38:23.533
You were never good as me, man!

38:23.568 --> 38:24.456
- Never!
- What?

38:24.491 --> 38:26.670
I don't think so, Sonny G.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.138
BENNY: Not my...

38:29.905 --> 38:32.039
(groans)

38:33.890 --> 38:35.145
Mm.

38:35.261 --> 38:38.705
I'm no expert on L.A.
street art, but it's funny...

38:38.811 --> 38:41.948
this piece seems a lot
more authentic to me now.

38:47.583 --> 38:50.118
I think I'll keep it.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.829
(screaming)

38:55.933 --> 38:56.900
(scream fades)

38:57.176 --> 39:00.308
FEMALE REPORTER: We're here live at
the location of the impromptu shrine

39:00.343 --> 39:04.727
for Paola Cortez, the young art school
student killed at the fashion show

39:04.762 --> 39:06.842
for artist/designer Benny Choi,

39:06.877 --> 39:08.456
who has been arrested for the killing.

39:08.491 --> 39:10.430
OLIVIA: (clears throat) Can
we start, please? Excuse me.

39:10.465 --> 39:11.583
WOMAN: Yes, ma'am.

39:11.618 --> 39:12.916
Thank you.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.152
(sighing): The mother...

39:14.233 --> 39:17.154
of Paola Cortez can rest
a little easier tonight,

39:17.189 --> 39:21.124
knowing that her daughter's
killer is behind bars.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.281
The arrest of Benny Choi and
several of the Latin Kings membership

39:24.371 --> 39:27.867
is a reminder that my LAPD

39:27.902 --> 39:30.622
means justice for all.

39:33.014 --> 39:36.029
You know, I'd love to make
that woman cry for real.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.170
She's gonna be chief of
police because of you.

39:38.205 --> 39:39.506
- Mm.
- (sighs)

39:39.611 --> 39:40.951
I don't know how you do it.

39:40.986 --> 39:42.861
I simply made good on a favor.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.788
- Aren't you the little saint?
- Oh, no, no.

39:44.823 --> 39:47.221
This time, I called in my IOU.

39:47.293 --> 39:50.921
Olivia got what she wanted,
and I got what I wanted.

39:50.994 --> 39:52.780
Oh, don't say it. Come on, don't say it.

39:52.815 --> 39:56.962
I am now an official civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

39:57.038 --> 39:59.262
- Oh.
- Not that there's anything civil

39:59.297 --> 40:00.009
about the Devil.

40:00.044 --> 40:01.856
What fun would that be?

40:04.019 --> 40:04.965
Okay, then.

40:05.024 --> 40:06.167
You win.

40:06.202 --> 40:07.297
We're partners.

40:07.398 --> 40:09.005
What, you're not going to protest?

40:09.040 --> 40:09.623
Actually, no.

40:09.658 --> 40:13.094
I may have no idea what
your angle is, but...

40:13.345 --> 40:15.587
at least now I can keep my eye on you.

40:15.622 --> 40:16.915
Keep your enemies close, right?

40:16.950 --> 40:18.259
Close?

40:18.294 --> 40:20.675
So does this mean you're gonna take me home

40:20.710 --> 40:23.796
and consummate our new
arrangement, then, Detective?

40:25.765 --> 40:28.234
(laughs)

40:29.802 --> 40:31.483
Oh.

40:31.575 --> 40:34.103
I'll take that as a yes.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.871
(engine starts)

40:41.033 --> 40:42.364
Seriously?

40:42.494 --> 40:43.573
What, you're just gonna leave me here?

40:43.608 --> 40:44.881
In this part of town?

40:44.996 --> 40:46.606
You said you wanted danger.

40:46.641 --> 40:47.244
What...?

40:47.805 --> 40:50.557
Detective! Detective!

40:52.672 --> 40:54.807
I don't even have a phone!

40:56.168 --> 40:57.209
Ah, well.

40:57.244 --> 40:59.289
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

41:29.645 --> 41:32.827
Yes, you may have a point about
the dangers of becoming mortal.

41:32.862 --> 41:34.428
There are consequences.

41:34.463 --> 41:35.908
I need to be careful.

41:35.943 --> 41:37.394
Yes, you do.

41:37.531 --> 41:39.896
Yes, after all, I almost
