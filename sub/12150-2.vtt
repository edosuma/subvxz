00:03.729 --> 00:05.730
The Hyperion Hotel.

00:06.129 --> 00:09.080
- It seems to be abandoned.
- 68 rooms, 68 vacancies.

00:10.330 --> 00:13.980
- I'd say, built in the late '20s.
- That's my guess.

00:14.529 --> 00:18.530
It's in what used to be old Hollywood.
Probably empty for years.

00:19.329 --> 00:20.559
From the look of it.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.550
English Breakfast tea...

00:24.730 --> 00:27.500
...coffee, O-pos.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.820
Is its current condition due to more
than just the tourist trade drying up?

00:31.329 --> 00:32.490
Yeah.

00:36.729 --> 00:38.100
Something the matter?

00:38.530 --> 00:41.200
I, uh....
I think it's gone bad.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.439
It's starting to coagulate.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.829
No, that's cinnamon.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.530
I can't try something?

00:49.929 --> 00:51.009
What do we do?

00:51.130 --> 00:54.609
I need you two to find out
about this place.

00:55.329 --> 00:58.840
- Who's the client?
- No client. I'll check back later.

00:59.530 --> 01:02.689
- Cryptic much?
- This goes beyond real estate.

01:03.729 --> 01:07.489
Look at cold police files.
Homicides, missing persons...

01:07.930 --> 01:10.180
...everything from
the beginning to now.

01:10.930 --> 01:14.370
You think whatever lived there
did so for some time.

01:15.129 --> 01:17.200
Probably right up to the end.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.930 --> 01:52.000
Returned mail for 315.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.819
Mr. Ferris should try using stamps.

01:55.329 --> 01:59.469
Mrs. Miggins' breakfast from Val's
Liquors. They've cut off her credit.

02:00.129 --> 02:02.829
And the weekly bill for 217.

02:03.730 --> 02:06.709
Whoa, whoa, why me?
I did it last time.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.090
Guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.759
Say, how about instead
I deliver an eviction notice?

02:15.729 --> 02:18.569
We cannot evict residents
because they're strange.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.379
If we did, we'd close down.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.680
Ever look into his eyes?

02:25.330 --> 02:27.050
There's nothing there.

03:24.129 --> 03:26.159
Hello? Bellman. Anybody home?

03:27.729 --> 03:31.030
Okay. Well, I guess
you've gone out, so....

03:33.129 --> 03:35.020
I'll just leave this here...

03:35.530 --> 03:38.860
...and you can pick it up
when it's convenient.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.710
Come on, come on.

05:31.370 --> 05:34.879
Are you now or have you ever been a
member of the Communist Party?

05:35.569 --> 05:39.079
I'm framing my answer in the
only way an American citizen--

05:39.769 --> 05:42.610
Then you deny....

05:43.370 --> 05:47.199
Come on, honey. This is how
Lana Turner got started.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.879
No messages for 217.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.379
Mr. Carter's bag to 515. Thanks.

06:06.170 --> 06:10.910
I know what the sign says,
but we have no vacancies right now.

06:12.170 --> 06:16.170
Sign's wrong. Sure it is. Come on.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.560
Yes....

07:29.569 --> 07:30.730
Yes....

07:39.170 --> 07:40.709
I understand.

07:41.569 --> 07:43.040
Of course.

07:44.569 --> 07:46.180
I am.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.789
I'll be finished in two shakes, sir.

08:39.169 --> 08:40.919
You're not the maid.

08:41.570 --> 08:42.769
What do you mean?

08:42.769 --> 08:45.679
You're no maid.
There's no trolley outside...

08:46.370 --> 08:48.120
...those sheets are dirty...

08:48.769 --> 08:51.330
...and you're the wrong color.

08:54.769 --> 08:59.019
I'm sorry.
The door was open. I just--

08:59.570 --> 09:00.970
There's nothing to steal.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.570
No, I wasn't stealing.
I can explain--

09:04.970 --> 09:07.360
Not interested. Just go.

09:09.169 --> 09:10.889
- I can't.
- I'll help you.

09:12.769 --> 09:15.580
My boyfriend,
he's the jealous type.

09:16.370 --> 09:19.250
Then you shouldn't
wander into men's rooms.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.549
He can't find me.

09:35.570 --> 09:36.970
Where is she?

09:39.769 --> 09:43.179
Look, pal,
this is none of your business.

09:43.970 --> 09:46.220
That's why you're gonna go away.

09:46.370 --> 09:48.509
I know you're hiding her in there.

09:49.370 --> 09:52.279
- I'm not hiding anybody.
- No?

09:54.769 --> 09:57.649
Then send her out here
so I don't have to get her.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.990
You're not coming in here.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.659
You won't mind if I come in
and look around, then?

10:19.370 --> 10:21.299
Guess I do mind.

10:30.169 --> 10:32.309
He's going down.

10:34.370 --> 10:37.210
Gosh. That was.... Gosh!

10:37.970 --> 10:41.409
Listen, I know we got off on
the wrong foot. My name is Judy.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.970
The hotel closed its doors
on December 16, 1919,

10:58.049 --> 11:02.299
That morning, the concierge made
his rounds with a 12-gauge shotgun...

11:02.850 --> 11:05.830
...room to room.
It's been empty ever since.

11:06.450 --> 11:10.629
According to city records,
it was declared a landmark.

11:11.250 --> 11:15.460
The company that owns it has been
trying to sell for 10 years...

11:16.649 --> 11:18.649
- ...no buyers.
- Well, no wonder.

11:19.049 --> 11:22.169
These records indicate
a storied legacy...

11:22.649 --> 11:25.879
...of murder and mayhem
dating back to '28...

11:26.850 --> 11:29.659
...when a roofer killed himself
and two others.

11:29.850 --> 11:33.399
Wow. That's really interesting.
What are we doing?

11:34.049 --> 11:35.450
- Doing?
- Yes.

11:35.850 --> 11:39.399
Angel never told us
the point of all this.

11:40.649 --> 11:43.070
Ah, well. I mean, clearly...

11:43.649 --> 11:47.759
...he has us organizing data,
compiling incidents so that....

11:50.250 --> 11:53.659
Yes, I did notice that,
the "no point" thing.

11:55.649 --> 12:00.389
Frankly, I haven't the slightest idea
what to do with all this.

12:01.049 --> 12:05.120
Wesley.
Look who was staying here in '52.

12:07.049 --> 12:09.820
Well, now we know
one thing for certain.

12:10.649 --> 12:14.690
Yup, vampires do photograph,
they just don't do it well.

12:15.450 --> 12:18.500
I mean, we know that Angel had
a connection to this place.

12:19.649 --> 12:22.320
So why didn't he just tell us?

12:22.649 --> 12:25.490
Perhaps he was ashamed to.

13:02.370 --> 13:03.909
Yes.

13:04.169 --> 13:05.850
Yes, I did.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.320
Yes, I do.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.750
She was cleaning
when she found him.

14:11.649 --> 14:15.159
- She touch anything?
- Consuela? Does she ever?

14:20.049 --> 14:22.009
Oh, my goodness.

14:22.450 --> 14:26.519
This is the third one in three months.
Why does this happen here?

14:27.250 --> 14:30.659
- The guy seemed depressed.
- How could you tell?

14:31.450 --> 14:35.629
Kind of cheap, though. The
death-wishers usually tip better.

14:37.450 --> 14:41.730
Take a look at the way his body
is laid down. You can tell....

14:45.850 --> 14:49.990
Three in three months,
they'll shut you down,

14:50.649 --> 14:52.750
Yes. They will.

14:53.049 --> 14:55.720
Who do you want me to call first?

14:56.649 --> 14:57.559
What?

14:57.850 --> 15:01.330
- The carpet cleaners or the cops?
- Don't call anyone.

15:02.049 --> 15:04.049
- They'll shut us down.
- What about him?

15:04.450 --> 15:06.769
- What about him?
- We can't leave him.

15:07.450 --> 15:10.750
Right. Store him in the meat locker.

15:11.049 --> 15:12.940
Store him?

15:15.850 --> 15:17.110
We're gonna store him?

15:17.649 --> 15:19.720
The salesman in 215 shot himself.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.909
- Really, suicide?
- In this hotel.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.909
- They're not reporting it.
- Terrible!

15:25.450 --> 15:28.429
Why? It was a suicide.
Why involve anyone else?

15:29.049 --> 15:32.210
- Are all writers crass?
- Are all actors naive?

15:32.649 --> 15:35.600
Do you want the press
to get involved?

15:36.250 --> 15:39.690
- Nothing wrong with discretion.
- That's what I say.

15:40.450 --> 15:42.659
Maybe this wasn't a suicide,

15:43.450 --> 15:47.169
Are you sure you're safe here?

16:07.169 --> 16:10.220
The world ends in 10 minutes.

16:11.370 --> 16:15.940
I saw you over here.
I thought I'd say hello. Hello!

16:17.970 --> 16:20.179
Have you seen the show?

16:21.570 --> 16:22.730
You should.

16:22.769 --> 16:27.409
It makes whatever problems
we have seem insignificant.

16:28.169 --> 16:30.379
The entire universe explodes.

16:31.169 --> 16:34.539
- Sounds exciting.
- Well, it's air-conditioned.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.000
And it's cheaper than
going to the pictures.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.669
I had to get out of the hotel.

16:41.970 --> 16:43.789
Did he come back?

16:44.370 --> 16:45.740
Come back?

16:47.370 --> 16:49.620
Your boyfriend.

16:49.769 --> 16:52.049
Oh. No.

16:52.769 --> 16:55.889
I mean the guy in 215.

16:56.370 --> 16:59.210
- He killed himself.
- Yeah. I guess so.

16:59.970 --> 17:03.620
Imagine that wallpaper being
the last thing you ever see?

17:05.368 --> 17:08.390
Maybe it was the wallpaper
that drove him to it.

17:08.970 --> 17:11.069
I sort of hate it there.

17:14.368 --> 17:17.180
I guess it's nicer than some places.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.180
It's a place.

17:20.970 --> 17:25.150
Listen, I know you didn't
want to help me before...

17:25.769 --> 17:29.000
...but you did.
And I want to thank you.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.799
You're gonna miss
the end of the world.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.160
Right.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.000
See you around.

17:58.769 --> 18:00.140
Yeah.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.240
Put Frank Gilnitz in '52.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.579
But he wasn't executed until '54.
Shouldn't he go there?

18:18.809 --> 18:21.230
He wasn't executed until '54,
but the crime...

18:21.809 --> 18:25.359
...of murdering a salesman and
storing his body in the meat locker...

18:26.009 --> 18:28.640
That occurred in '52.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.710
It's like a puzzle.

18:33.210 --> 18:37.559
The who-died-horribly-because
Angel-screwed up-50-years-ago game.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.099
--so the guy asks me:

18:42.569 --> 18:44.460
- "Do they serve peanuts here?"
- So?

18:44.970 --> 18:49.819
- So he was thinking about peanuts?
- Maybe he was hungry.

18:50.369 --> 18:53.700
- This wasn't suicide.
- I thought his door was locked.

18:54.569 --> 18:56.319
- Exactly.
- It's too perfect.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.380
Locked-door mystery.
I've written it a hundred times.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.420
Hey!

19:11.609 --> 19:13.500
Can you come in for a sec?

19:20.009 --> 19:21.170
Did you hear?

19:21.809 --> 19:23.420
Hear what?

19:23.609 --> 19:25.119
The guy in 215.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.670
It wasn't a suicide.
He was murdered.

19:29.609 --> 19:31.430
- I don't think so.
- So it's true.

19:32.009 --> 19:34.710
There's gonna be police
and questions...

19:35.009 --> 19:38.839
...and I thought that you might
want to know, in case maybe--

19:39.809 --> 19:44.549
- Not that you're hiding anything.
- Everyone here's hiding something.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.470
Yeah....

19:47.009 --> 19:51.680
I kind of owe you one, on account
of what you did for me before.

19:52.410 --> 19:53.569
Thanks.

19:59.609 --> 20:02.910
I guess if we left now,
it would look bad.

20:03.809 --> 20:04.890
That all depends.

20:05.009 --> 20:08.940
This have anything to do with
that P.I. I tossed out of here?

20:11.609 --> 20:14.099
You knew he wasn't my boyfriend.

20:14.609 --> 20:16.329
I had a hunch.

20:20.609 --> 20:23.210
I think he works
for my former employers.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.559
City Trust Bank of Salina, Kansas.

20:27.210 --> 20:29.380
I was a teller there.

20:33.809 --> 20:36.339
I think maybe they want this back.

20:48.210 --> 20:51.789
I haven't spent any of it.
Not a dime. I won't touch it.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.089
- Why take it?
- I don't know.

20:54.809 --> 20:58.920
I was angry. I panicked.
Things were going so well.

20:59.609 --> 21:02.940
I loved this job
and I loved this guy.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.349
We were engaged and...

21:06.210 --> 21:09.089
...they found out about me
and I got fired.

21:09.210 --> 21:13.140
And then Peter dumped me
and I just couldn't go back there...

21:14.009 --> 21:18.329
...so I took this and I just ran.

21:23.009 --> 21:25.329
Aren't you gonna ask
why they fired me?

21:28.410 --> 21:30.019
Why did they fire you?

21:32.009 --> 21:34.329
Because I'm not what I say I am.

21:35.009 --> 21:38.630
- I've been passing since I was 15.
- Passing?

21:39.210 --> 21:40.720
For white.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.869
My mom was colored. My father...

21:43.410 --> 21:44.950
...I didn't know him.

21:45.210 --> 21:47.769
My blood isn't pure. It's tainted.

21:53.609 --> 21:56.839
It's just blood, Judy.

21:57.809 --> 21:59.980
It's all just blood.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.509
Nobody believes that.

22:02.009 --> 22:04.009
Not even my mother's family.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.900
I'm not one thing or the other.
I am nothing.

22:08.609 --> 22:10.779
I know what that's like.

22:14.609 --> 22:17.559
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:21.210 --> 22:22.890
I am something.

22:26.609 --> 22:29.660
I'm a thief.

22:30.210 --> 22:33.900
I've never stolen anything before
in my life. I swear it.

22:34.410 --> 22:38.200
- The things they called me.
- Fear makes people do stupid things.

22:39.210 --> 22:40.930
It was stupid. And I'm sorry.

22:41.009 --> 22:42.730
I didn't mean you.

22:44.009 --> 22:48.190
I meant your employers.
They were afraid so they fired you.

22:48.809 --> 22:51.339
What am I going to do?
I am trapped.

22:53.609 --> 22:55.890
- You're not trapped.
- I am!

22:56.009 --> 22:59.519
If I leave now, it'll look suspicious,
but if the cops find this--

23:00.210 --> 23:02.559
They're not gonna find it.

23:03.809 --> 23:06.130
Because I'm gonna help you.

23:07.410 --> 23:08.710
So where do we put her?

23:09.210 --> 23:11.880
When did she die?

23:12.210 --> 23:15.900
Doesn't say. Just that she was
tracked by the FBI for robbery.

23:16.410 --> 23:20.690
She checked into the Hyperion in '52
and was never heard from again.

23:23.009 --> 23:24.660
- '52?
- '52.

23:41.690 --> 23:43.690
It'll be okay down here.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.970
For a few days,
until the cops are gone.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.480
Judy, there are no cops.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.000
Well, not yet.

23:53.690 --> 23:57.059
God, I can't go to prison.
I just can't.

23:58.490 --> 24:02.670
The thought of being confined,
trapped. It'd be like death.

24:03.289 --> 24:05.890
No, it'd be something
worse than death.

24:06.890 --> 24:09.309
It'd be like being buried alive.

24:12.289 --> 24:15.099
Go back to your room. Stay there.

24:20.089 --> 24:22.410
There's something in this hotel.

24:27.289 --> 24:29.779
And it makes people crazy.

24:31.490 --> 24:35.630
If somehow the money ended up
on the bank's doorstep...

24:36.289 --> 24:38.289
If they saw that I didn't spend it...

24:38.690 --> 24:41.359
...you think they'd call off that P.I.?

24:41.690 --> 24:44.430
- Maybe I could go free.
- Maybe.

24:46.490 --> 24:49.650
There is such a thing
as forgiveness, right?

25:29.089 --> 25:30.390
I can sense it.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.640
There's a pattern here.

25:33.890 --> 25:36.980
A force lived at the hotel
in the last decades...

25:37.490 --> 25:40.160
...affecting staff and residents.

25:41.690 --> 25:45.170
- I just fear there's no way to--
- A Thesulac.

25:45.890 --> 25:47.680
Paranoia demon.

25:48.289 --> 25:52.470
Whispers to its victims,
feeds on their innate insecurities.

25:56.690 --> 25:59.319
- Angel wants to talk to you.
- Hello?

26:00.289 --> 26:03.549
Thesulac's been here
since the day it was built.

26:05.089 --> 26:09.160
Thought maybe we could track it,
but it's still here.

26:11.089 --> 26:15.019
I want you, Gunn and Cordy
here ASAP. We're gonna raise it.

26:15.890 --> 26:18.940
- Raise it?
- We have to in order to kill it.

26:20.089 --> 26:23.000
You want me to research
the raising ritual?

26:23.690 --> 26:25.339
Already done it.

26:29.410 --> 26:33.940
A zany redhead? Could be a brunette,
for all I can tell.

26:35.410 --> 26:37.799
I'll have to take their word for it.

26:38.410 --> 26:39.920
You Denver?

26:40.210 --> 26:42.670
That's me. What can I do you for?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.240
I need information on demons.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.369
Do you now?

26:48.009 --> 26:49.759
Possessing entities...

26:49.809 --> 26:52.930
...demonic suggestions, exorcisms,
cleansing rituals....

26:54.009 --> 26:55.690
Try this one.

27:00.609 --> 27:03.029
That's right.
Run, coward of the night!

27:03.609 --> 27:07.440
I'm seriously thinking of putting
my bed right in here.

27:08.410 --> 27:11.740
So you can't come in here.
Do you know who I am?

27:12.609 --> 27:15.869
You've got a reputation.
Now I will draw blood...

27:16.809 --> 27:19.720
...if you pull any more crap.
Understand?

27:20.410 --> 27:22.970
I want the books in the back.

27:26.410 --> 27:29.039
- What took you so long?
- He wouldn't fit.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.420
What?

27:31.210 --> 27:33.529
- What'd you do with him?
- He's in there.

27:34.210 --> 27:37.049
I had to make him fit.

27:37.809 --> 27:40.269
- Any chance I'd get in trouble for that?
- Don't be paranoid.

27:40.809 --> 27:43.160
- You had reasons to kill him!
- What?

27:43.210 --> 27:44.470
I didn't know him.

27:45.009 --> 27:47.960
But if he saw you
with one of your trysts...

27:48.609 --> 27:52.859
...he could expose your little
peccadilloes to the press.

27:53.410 --> 27:58.430
You hack! Just because the studio
won't take your calls, comrade!

27:59.410 --> 28:00.779
- Pansy!
- Red!

28:01.210 --> 28:04.089
- There's a murderer here.
- And we're gonna find him.

28:13.210 --> 28:17.180
They know, they'll turn you in,
You'll go to prison,

28:18.009 --> 28:21.940
How long do you think someone
like you will last in prison?

28:33.609 --> 28:35.960
So you were my age
when you were made?

28:36.609 --> 28:40.259
- I don't know. How old are you?
- Just north of 30.

28:40.809 --> 28:42.599
No.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.440
How do I kill Thesulac?

28:46.809 --> 28:50.220
- You don't. You run away.
- There's got to be a way.

28:51.009 --> 28:52.170
Well....

28:52.809 --> 28:55.339
You gotta make it fat, corporeal.

28:55.809 --> 28:58.230
But that only happens after it eats.

28:58.809 --> 29:01.650
Or if you raise it. But that's tricky.

29:02.410 --> 29:03.569
How?

29:04.210 --> 29:07.759
The incantation's in the book,
but you need an Orb.

29:08.410 --> 29:11.150
- I'll sell you one cheap--
- For free.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.299
For free.

29:17.410 --> 29:21.660
Now, you also need sacred herbs...

29:23.410 --> 29:26.359
...divining powder,
and something to hit it with.

29:27.009 --> 29:28.690
- That'll kill it?
- Maybe.

29:28.809 --> 29:32.109
It wouldn't hurt
to have a lightning strike.

29:33.009 --> 29:36.589
Short of that, I'd go with
something big and heavy.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.000
Pack it up.

29:40.809 --> 29:43.650
A vampire helping humans?

29:45.009 --> 29:48.630
- I just don't get it.
- To be honest, I don't either.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.190
Right! You once asked me
where you could get a gun.

29:54.490 --> 29:58.880
- For protection.
- From a salesman about to bust you.

29:59.890 --> 30:02.769
- He shot himself.
- Did he? Were you there?

30:03.490 --> 30:04.690
Consuela found him!

30:04.690 --> 30:06.650
She could have shot him.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.359
Hey!

30:11.890 --> 30:14.660
Name's C. Mulvihill, P.I.

30:14.890 --> 30:17.059
He looks suspicious.

30:17.890 --> 30:19.990
I'm looking for this woman.

30:47.289 --> 30:48.730
Let's do this.

30:50.890 --> 30:54.299
We call thee forth,
Thesulac of the netherworld...

30:55.089 --> 30:59.619
...and command you to join us
on the physical plane.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.299
- The Orb of Ramjarin.
- How about a "please"?

31:08.289 --> 31:12.079
Please. And be careful.
Conjuring orbs are very fragile.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.910
- Angel!
- Don't listen to it. Just ignore it.

31:18.490 --> 31:21.720
- They were like this in the car.
- Oh.

31:22.089 --> 31:26.480
We invoke thee by the power
of all the priests of Ramjarin.

31:28.089 --> 31:31.349
What was once in our thoughts...

31:32.289 --> 31:34.359
...be now in our midst.

31:41.890 --> 31:43.960
Why are you hiding out up here?

31:44.890 --> 31:47.589
- You're hurting me! Stop!
- Then start talking.

31:47.890 --> 31:51.119
- You registered under a fake name.
- We have proof!

31:52.089 --> 31:54.789
What else has the slut lied about?

31:55.089 --> 31:57.259
I'm sorry. It wasn't me!

31:58.089 --> 31:59.170
Sorry for what?

31:59.289 --> 32:02.059
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

32:03.490 --> 32:07.490
It was him! Look in his room.
He's got blood! He's a monster!

32:11.289 --> 32:13.109
What kind of maniac are you?

32:13.690 --> 32:14.920
Grab him! Get him!

32:44.089 --> 32:45.250
We got you now!

32:46.490 --> 32:48.309
String him up!

33:02.690 --> 33:03.849
Push him! Push him!

33:03.890 --> 33:05.849
Come on, push him out!

33:20.089 --> 33:21.319
Swing, you freak!

33:21.890 --> 33:24.630
Yeah, you had that coming.

33:32.089 --> 33:33.670
Lord, what did we do?

33:35.690 --> 33:37.130
What?

33:38.690 --> 33:39.849
What's wrong?

33:40.490 --> 33:41.930
I don't get it.

33:42.890 --> 33:46.819
Where's everybody going?
It's just a....

34:20.090 --> 34:22.090
I don't know about you...

34:22.489 --> 34:24.030
...but I'm stuffed!

34:25.489 --> 34:27.239
God, I love people.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.159
Don't you?

34:32.690 --> 34:36.199
They feed me the worst.
And I serve it right back.

34:36.889 --> 34:40.610
And the fear and prejudice
turns to certainty and hate...

34:41.690 --> 34:45.199
...and I take another bite
and mmm, mmm, mmm!

34:45.889 --> 34:50.030
What a beautiful, beautiful dance!

34:53.090 --> 34:55.829
You got your feelings hurt,
didn't you?

34:57.289 --> 34:59.079
Stick your neck out...

35:00.289 --> 35:02.710
...and they throw a rope around it.

35:03.289 --> 35:05.500
And you thought you made a friend.

35:05.690 --> 35:06.949
News flash, you had!

35:07.489 --> 35:11.210
That's what made her
the yummiest morsel of all.

35:11.690 --> 35:15.019
You reached her.
Restored her faith in people.

35:15.889 --> 35:19.260
Without you, she would've been
just another appetizer.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.409
But you plumped her up good.

35:22.489 --> 35:27.550
Now she's a meal
that's gonna last me a lifetime!

35:30.889 --> 35:33.590
Hey, you know what?

35:34.489 --> 35:37.750
There's a whole hotel here
full of tortured souls...

35:38.090 --> 35:40.579
...who could really use your help.

35:42.889 --> 35:44.920
What do you say?

35:50.090 --> 35:53.179
Take them all.

36:04.849 --> 36:06.219
- Watch his tentacles.
- Pardon?

36:06.650 --> 36:08.019
Tentacles.

36:08.449 --> 36:10.170
I didn't order takeout...

36:10.849 --> 36:13.130
...but this looks good.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.570
Not as good as the last one...

36:16.250 --> 36:19.199
...but full of tasty paranoia
just the same.

36:21.050 --> 36:22.940
Especially that one.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.130
What did he mean by that?

36:25.849 --> 36:27.570
You've had your last meal.

36:27.650 --> 36:30.630
- You should've gotten out then.
- Gotten out?

36:31.250 --> 36:33.179
Now why would I want to do that...

36:33.650 --> 36:36.980
...when the room service is so good?

36:37.849 --> 36:39.530
Has been for 50 years.

36:42.050 --> 36:45.349
The paranoia here is like fine wine.

36:46.250 --> 36:48.670
It gets better with age.

36:49.849 --> 36:51.429
You're still feeding. Gunn!

36:59.449 --> 37:01.030
Kitchen's closed.

37:31.849 --> 37:35.429
What did it mean,
"especially that one"?

38:16.570 --> 38:18.500
Judy?

38:23.170 --> 38:25.730
I don't hear them anymore.

38:27.369 --> 38:29.369
Are they gone?

38:33.969 --> 38:35.130
Yeah.

38:45.369 --> 38:48.320
- It's you.
- Yeah, Judy...

38:48.969 --> 38:50.690
...it's me.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.039
You look the same.

39:03.369 --> 39:05.510
I'm not.

39:06.369 --> 39:08.329
They killed you...

39:09.969 --> 39:13.059
...because of me. I killed you.

39:13.570 --> 39:14.800
No.

39:20.170 --> 39:21.960
He kept them from the door.

39:23.170 --> 39:27.309
He told me I'd be safe.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.670
Am I safe?

39:33.969 --> 39:36.389
You're safe.

39:36.969 --> 39:41.039
- Can I go out now?
- Yeah. You can go out.

39:43.570 --> 39:45.639
Let me help you.

39:48.369 --> 39:49.739
I just....

39:50.170 --> 39:53.190
I need to take a little rest first.

39:53.769 --> 39:56.300
Just a little rest.

39:57.969 --> 39:59.409
Easy.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.000
I'm so sorry I killed you.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.889
Can you forgive me?

40:15.369 --> 40:17.050
Of course.

40:20.170 --> 40:23.119
I'm just going to rest.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.909
Just for a minute.

40:29.170 --> 40:32.750
And then I'm going to go out.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.699
I've been called many things before.

40:44.170 --> 40:47.260
But paranoid has never
been one of them.

40:48.969 --> 40:52.690
Unless people have said
it behind my back.

40:55.570 --> 40:57.820
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

40:57.969 --> 40:59.900
We finished?

41:00.969 --> 41:02.159
I think so.

41:02.170 --> 41:05.579
Good. I will be glad
to see the last of this place.

41:06.369 --> 41:07.530
It scares me.

41:07.570 --> 41:10.239
No lie. And it stinks.
You notice that?

41:11.170 --> 41:14.260
70 years of violence
and mayhem? Bad vibes.

41:14.769 --> 41:16.940
- We're moving in.
- What's not to love?

41:17.769 --> 41:18.710
Angel?

41:18.969 --> 41:20.690
Surely you realize...

41:20.769 --> 41:25.190
...that this place has housed
not only a demonic presence...

41:26.170 --> 41:30.519
...but the worst faces of humanity.
This is a house of evil.

41:31.570 --> 41:32.800
Not anymore.

41:41.769 --> 41:47.320
Angel, you don't find me
especially paranoid, do you?

41:49.570 --> 41:52.340
- Not especially.
- Oh, thank God.

41:54.369 --> 41:55.420
I was worried.
