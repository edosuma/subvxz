WEBVTT

00:00.087 --> 00:01.488
Previously on "Cardinal".

00:01.522 --> 00:03.289
If this man can find her at school,

00:03.324 --> 00:04.691
he can find her at home.

00:04.725 --> 00:05.859
They can stay with me.

00:05.893 --> 00:06.960
You weren't supposed to kill them

00:06.994 --> 00:08.328
until after you had the weapons.

00:08.362 --> 00:09.796
They said that they're in the storage.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.164
Don't know where it is yet.

00:11.198 --> 00:12.532
What are you doing?

00:12.566 --> 00:14.901
I'm just gonna check these
last three lockers, boss.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.171
Do you doubt that
Catherine took her own life?

00:18.205 --> 00:19.739
I believe I knew my wife.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.341
I thought that this
was something he needed

00:21.375 --> 00:22.642
to get out of his system.

00:22.676 --> 00:23.643
You don't believe she did it?

00:23.677 --> 00:24.644
And that should be enough.

00:24.678 --> 00:26.312
No, it's not. Take the weekend,

00:26.347 --> 00:28.147
and come back when you're
ready to work with me.

00:28.182 --> 00:29.649
Stop! Police!

00:30.718 --> 00:32.185
What happened with the civilian?

00:32.219 --> 00:33.486
He's dead.

00:33.521 --> 00:34.821
The car was reported
stolen from Pearson airport

00:34.855 --> 00:35.989
a couple weeks ago.

00:36.023 --> 00:37.690
There must be security footage somewhere.

00:38.926 --> 00:40.260
I need your help.

00:40.294 --> 00:42.161
I messed up.

00:42.196 --> 00:43.830
Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!

00:44.943 --> 00:46.723
Lloyd Kreeger.

00:46.757 --> 00:47.834
Where's Henry?

00:47.868 --> 00:48.937
He left.

00:48.971 --> 00:50.236
You're out of your mind.

00:50.271 --> 00:51.671
Feel better knowing the truth?

You have no idea

01:52.032 --> 01:53.972
who this man was.

01:55.436 --> 01:56.836
What he went through.

01:58.606 --> 02:00.440
I doubt you did either.

02:47.421 --> 02:48.855
Please don't say anything.

02:50.357 --> 02:51.557
I won't.

02:54.928 --> 02:57.230
I didn't mean to get so drunk.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.232
It just happened.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.500
It's all right.

03:02.836 --> 03:05.168
No, Dad, it's not alright.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.109
She left us.

03:13.514 --> 03:14.914
She just left.

03:18.018 --> 03:19.218
I know.

03:20.888 --> 03:22.088
I know.

03:24.558 --> 03:25.758
Come on.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.699
I hate what she did to us.

03:35.035 --> 03:37.036
Shh shh shh shh.

04:38.866 --> 04:40.700
I don't want to see you anymore.

05:10.964 --> 05:12.165
Here.

05:13.967 --> 05:15.101
You must be cold.

05:15.135 --> 05:16.335
Thank you.

05:21.975 --> 05:23.810
They've been gone all night.

05:24.978 --> 05:26.813
The boys can take care of themselves.

05:28.374 --> 05:29.808
But not each other.

05:42.162 --> 05:43.362
Where's your brother?

05:49.002 --> 05:50.403
Where is Lemur, Jack?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.453
He robbed another ATM.

05:56.435 --> 05:58.036
I don't know why he did it.

06:00.013 --> 06:01.414
I think for you, Nikki.

06:05.185 --> 06:07.434
That woman cop from the news,

06:08.380 --> 06:09.781
she shot him.

06:12.192 --> 06:13.392
He's gone.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.597
I tried to help him.

06:17.631 --> 06:18.659
No!

06:18.693 --> 06:19.866
No!

06:34.815 --> 06:36.249
I'm really embarrassed.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.551
I don't even remember
what I said last night.

06:42.322 --> 06:43.456
Sorry.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.924
No need to apologize.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.620
So, we're okay?

06:49.655 --> 06:50.856
We're fine.

06:51.765 --> 06:53.966
- You want some breakfast?
- Nope.

06:55.235 --> 06:56.435
Please no.

07:03.147 --> 07:04.210
Is that hers?

07:04.244 --> 07:05.293
Yeah.

07:05.327 --> 07:07.580
I'm free today so I thought

07:07.614 --> 07:08.814
maybe it was time we,

07:09.416 --> 07:12.218
pick out some photos for the exhibit.

07:12.252 --> 07:13.853
Don't you work this weekend?

07:15.255 --> 07:16.455
Not anymore.

07:17.257 --> 07:18.457
Is everything okay?

07:20.093 --> 07:21.294
I don't know.

07:24.097 --> 07:25.698
I might have made a mistake.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.768
You never make mistakes.

07:29.214 --> 07:31.215
Mom always said that
she was the screw-up.

07:37.811 --> 07:40.780
Uh, everyone was asking me what
I was doing for Thanksgiving

07:40.814 --> 07:41.781
last night.

07:41.815 --> 07:43.215
What are we doing?

07:45.658 --> 07:47.058
Do you want to just skip it?

07:48.574 --> 07:49.975
Should we go out to eat?

07:51.391 --> 07:52.625
Or maybe I can cook.

07:53.894 --> 07:55.361
What?

07:55.395 --> 07:56.829
How hard can it be?

07:58.665 --> 08:02.268
Just promise you won't judge me if I...

08:02.302 --> 08:03.502
burn anything?

08:05.138 --> 08:06.339
I promise.

08:14.032 --> 08:15.819
_

08:15.819 --> 08:18.252
_

08:25.515 --> 08:27.774
_

08:31.565 --> 08:33.778
_

08:41.541 --> 08:44.710
_

08:45.946 --> 08:49.482
_

08:50.751 --> 08:54.999
_

08:57.357 --> 08:59.191
Hey, does cranberry sauce go bad?

09:02.362 --> 09:03.562
Dad?

09:05.399 --> 09:07.199
Uh,

09:07.234 --> 09:09.435
I have, I don't know.

09:09.821 --> 09:11.055
Maybe.

09:12.139 --> 09:13.372
Okay.

09:23.984 --> 09:26.852
_

09:28.226 --> 09:30.932
_

09:38.093 --> 09:42.401
_

09:57.417 --> 09:58.818
I know you killed him.

10:00.787 --> 10:01.987
Nikki.

10:02.823 --> 10:04.546
Lemur messed up.

10:05.759 --> 10:07.393
We weren't supposed to hit anymore ATMs,

10:07.427 --> 10:08.444
it was too hot,

10:08.478 --> 10:09.638
Stop lying!

10:09.672 --> 10:11.011
I'm not.

10:12.432 --> 10:13.888
Nikki, Lemur was...

10:17.637 --> 10:19.352
he was my brother, Nikki.

10:23.477 --> 10:24.677
Don't!

10:30.817 --> 10:32.418
Stop!

10:32.452 --> 10:34.200
Two and a half minutes, Nikki.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.290
Stop!

10:42.062 --> 10:43.295
Jack!

10:46.967 --> 10:48.467
Are you okay?

10:48.502 --> 10:49.902
Are you okay? Stop!

10:56.209 --> 10:58.177
You can take lives,
you can hurt your sister,

10:58.211 --> 11:00.643
but inside you're just soft!

11:05.085 --> 11:06.733
Get out of my sight!

11:16.767 --> 11:18.953
I opened Catherine's computer.

11:19.769 --> 11:20.902
Okay.

11:20.936 --> 11:22.304
A message popped up.

11:22.338 --> 11:23.772
Somebody who knew her,

11:24.774 --> 11:26.775
somebody I want to talk to in Toronto.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.052
Why are you telling me this?

11:31.147 --> 11:33.510
Because it's not enough
that I believe it.

11:36.452 --> 11:39.521
I need you to look at the
same things I'm looking at.

11:39.555 --> 11:42.977
I need you to tell me if I'm wrong.

11:43.359 --> 11:45.193
What is it you think
that person in Toronto

11:45.227 --> 11:46.328
is going to give you, John?

11:46.362 --> 11:47.696
Where does it end?

11:47.730 --> 11:49.164
I know how this sounds.

11:54.070 --> 11:55.937
But I'm doing it.

11:55.971 --> 11:57.372
I just wanted you to know.

11:58.974 --> 12:00.375
I'm driving down there.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.512
You can tell me about it on the way.

12:08.884 --> 12:10.085
Okay.

12:30.606 --> 12:31.973
Found a match on your car thief.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.408
I'm confident it's him.

12:34.510 --> 12:35.710
Okay.

12:36.245 --> 12:37.412
Here he is in the airport

12:37.446 --> 12:39.447
travelling with the same
woman from the garage.

12:41.751 --> 12:44.319
I looked at their manifest
from the flight from LaGuardia

12:44.353 --> 12:47.989
and your car thief's name is Liam Rouse.

12:48.023 --> 12:49.424
Yeah. That's him.

12:50.226 --> 12:51.426
But who's she?

12:52.027 --> 12:53.862
That is Sharlene Winston.

12:55.231 --> 12:56.431
Any relation?

12:57.466 --> 12:59.467
She wrote 'mother' on the customs form.

13:01.303 --> 13:02.404
Okay.

13:02.438 --> 13:05.340
Can you show me the other
passengers on that flight?

13:15.050 --> 13:16.251
Stop.

13:17.653 --> 13:19.521
Jackson Michael Till.

14:16.345 --> 14:18.313
So Jackson Till flies into Toronto

14:18.347 --> 14:20.081
with Liam Rouse and Sharlene Winston.

14:20.115 --> 14:22.317
They're set up to buy
guns from the Barstows,

14:22.351 --> 14:26.287
Rouse robs ATMs to
collect money for the deal.

14:26.322 --> 14:29.290
But instead Jackson Till
kills the Barstows.

14:29.325 --> 14:30.959
And then last night,

14:30.993 --> 14:32.193
he kills Rouse.

14:32.962 --> 14:34.996
This Sharlene Winston.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.965
What's she doing with all these kids?

14:36.999 --> 14:39.000
And why do they need all these weapons?

14:39.468 --> 14:42.537
I can't stop thinking about
what Michel Pilowski said.

14:42.571 --> 14:44.405
Enough guns to fight an army.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.245
So what happened?

14:51.747 --> 14:52.981
What is that?

14:58.420 --> 15:01.022
It's a birthday gift from Catherine.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.891
I guess she never picked it up.

15:04.193 --> 15:06.222
The woman from the bookstore,

15:07.029 --> 15:08.725
she told me things

15:09.565 --> 15:10.698
about Catherine.

15:10.733 --> 15:13.201
Her treatment wasn't working,

15:13.235 --> 15:16.524
she said that she felt
like she was under water.

15:17.873 --> 15:18.907
Before I left the Bay,

15:18.941 --> 15:21.487
I was seeing the same doctor.

15:22.444 --> 15:24.449
And you were seeing Dr. Bell.

15:25.014 --> 15:26.147
Yeah, if I'm being honest,

15:26.181 --> 15:28.149
he's part of the reason I left.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.246
What about him made you want to leave?

15:30.759 --> 15:31.892
I don't know.

15:31.917 --> 15:35.286
But the thing that
really got to Catherine

15:35.311 --> 15:37.253
was having to write that note.

15:38.093 --> 15:40.028
He got me to do one too.

15:40.062 --> 15:41.996
It's supposed to, you know, uh,

15:42.031 --> 15:44.010
exorcise our demons.

15:45.975 --> 15:47.375
A suicide note.

15:49.071 --> 15:51.434
He had you write a suicide note?

15:52.408 --> 15:55.043
Once you write something like that,

15:55.077 --> 16:00.915
it's hard to unthink those things.

16:14.229 --> 16:15.630
She got this for you.

16:19.234 --> 16:22.070
She said you two were
planning a trip to Dublin.

16:23.205 --> 16:25.840
She was so pleased when she found it.

16:26.075 --> 16:27.909
Why would she buy this for me

16:29.745 --> 16:31.579
if she were going to kill herself?

16:33.248 --> 16:34.649
Why would she do that?

16:37.252 --> 16:38.653
I don't know, John.

16:51.266 --> 16:52.467
What do you see?

16:55.137 --> 16:56.971
In the fire, what do you see?

16:58.674 --> 17:00.378
I only see flames.

17:06.115 --> 17:07.949
I'm going to get us our guns.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.719
And when we get up north,

17:13.722 --> 17:15.156
I'll be your best lieutenant.

17:18.894 --> 17:20.127
You can trust me.

17:23.298 --> 17:24.699
You're going to have to prove it.

17:28.303 --> 17:29.504
How?

17:33.709 --> 17:35.143
The cop who killed Lemur.

17:38.147 --> 17:39.347
I want her to pay.

17:40.916 --> 17:42.850
I want her dead, Jack.

17:57.908 --> 18:01.077
Did Catherine see any other
psychiatrists recently,

18:01.111 --> 18:02.312
other than Dr. Bell?

18:04.315 --> 18:06.694
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think she,

18:07.117 --> 18:09.252
she saw one that she,

18:09.286 --> 18:10.720
she liked at the hospital.

18:11.789 --> 18:14.327
Her name was Dr. Jones I think.

18:21.131 --> 18:23.032
You said you wanted to
let me look at this.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.267
So let me.

18:25.349 --> 18:26.549
Okay?

18:26.924 --> 18:28.124
Lay off.

18:29.606 --> 18:31.441
Are you doing this just so I'll stop?

18:33.423 --> 18:34.624
Does it matter?

18:44.355 --> 18:45.588
Stop! Stop!

18:47.758 --> 18:49.325
Would you rather me take you
back out to the bunkhouse

18:49.360 --> 18:50.593
with your friend?

18:50.761 --> 18:52.161
- No.
- Good. Sit down.

19:05.509 --> 19:06.709
Take it.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.315
Is this the blindfold and the smoke

19:12.349 --> 19:13.449
before you shoot me?

19:13.484 --> 19:14.751
No, it's just a cup of tea.

19:14.785 --> 19:15.985
I know what you really need

19:16.020 --> 19:17.848
and I'm not going to help ya.

19:18.455 --> 19:20.289
It doesn't matter what you do to me.

19:23.414 --> 19:25.606
Except, it's not just you.

19:28.799 --> 19:29.999
What does that mean?

19:32.302 --> 19:33.503
That means,

19:34.411 --> 19:37.702
2214 Forest Road,

19:38.809 --> 19:40.009
Halifax.

19:43.213 --> 19:45.681
The home of Layla Sable,
formerly Layla Kreeger.

19:45.716 --> 19:46.916
Your daughter?

19:50.421 --> 19:51.854
The one who doesn't visit?

19:55.759 --> 19:57.727
I have a friend watching her home

19:57.761 --> 19:59.862
and if I don't call, he
will put a bullet in her

19:59.897 --> 20:01.330
and one in your granddaughter.

20:05.102 --> 20:06.335
So,

20:08.338 --> 20:10.306
What I'd really like to talk about

20:10.340 --> 20:11.841
is how far north you can fly us

20:11.875 --> 20:13.276
in that plane outside.

20:17.548 --> 20:20.550
See, you are a good father.

20:21.385 --> 20:22.585
Hm.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.321
Come on in, John.

20:25.355 --> 20:27.590
He's right through there.

20:27.624 --> 20:28.858
Thank you.

20:31.462 --> 20:33.296
John, hello.

20:35.065 --> 20:37.500
I hope it's all right I stopped by.

20:37.534 --> 20:38.568
Of course.

20:38.602 --> 20:40.036
It's good to see you.

20:43.874 --> 20:46.008
You remember those cards
that I showed you?

20:46.043 --> 20:47.844
Hard to forget something so vile.

20:47.878 --> 20:49.078
Yeah.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.715
Well, I started thinking that
the person who sent them,

20:53.817 --> 20:57.353
Might somehow be responsible
for Catherine's death.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.421
I see.

20:58.455 --> 21:02.692
But, taking a step back,

21:02.726 --> 21:05.128
I realize that I was acting irrationally.

21:06.296 --> 21:08.297
Rational grief would be quite a feat.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.302
Do you blame yourself for what happened?

21:15.339 --> 21:16.572
Sometimes.

21:17.774 --> 21:19.775
Sometimes is better than all the time.

21:20.911 --> 21:22.745
But not as good as never.

21:25.516 --> 21:27.750
How many of your patients

21:27.784 --> 21:30.022
do you lose to a suicide?

21:31.121 --> 21:32.321
It happens.

21:32.923 --> 21:36.959
No matter how hard I work,
it still happens.

21:36.994 --> 21:38.494
Yeah.

21:38.529 --> 21:39.762
But how many?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.953
In a month or a year.

21:44.801 --> 21:46.435
This year, say.

21:47.437 --> 21:48.671
How many?

21:52.543 --> 21:53.976
What's this about, John?

21:55.879 --> 21:57.713
What are you really doing here?

21:59.349 --> 22:01.350
I just want to know what
happened to my wife.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.321
If you're still looking
for someone to blame,

22:05.355 --> 22:07.017
I hope it's not gonna be me.

22:09.193 --> 22:11.480
I did everything I could to help her.

22:14.364 --> 22:15.564
Did you?

22:25.976 --> 22:27.830
When you really wanna talk,

22:28.312 --> 22:29.946
let me know.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.740
A Sunday visitor.

22:59.876 --> 23:01.077
I feel sorry for him.

23:04.014 --> 23:07.383
I don't want to see John
Cardinal again, love.

23:07.417 --> 23:08.618
Not in the office,

23:09.459 --> 23:10.693
not around the house.

23:13.056 --> 23:15.891
He's just not in a good place
right now, I'm afraid.

23:18.195 --> 23:19.829
Okay.

23:44.415 --> 23:45.615
Jerry?

23:52.056 --> 23:53.456
Do you have breadcrumbs?

23:55.993 --> 23:57.627
The bottom of the toaster?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.563
Well if you go get some,
I'll make you a plate.

24:01.432 --> 24:03.266
I'll check with Nicole up the street.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.444
Hey. It's me.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.047
Hey.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.281
Everything alright?

24:18.783 --> 24:21.418
This Sharlene Winston barely existed

24:21.452 --> 24:23.620
before she was 18.

24:23.654 --> 24:24.788
Birth certificate,

24:24.822 --> 24:26.222
a few other documents,

24:26.257 --> 24:30.593
but no real records until
her military service.

24:30.628 --> 24:32.228
She seems like a fake.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.764
You think she assumes a fake identity

24:34.799 --> 24:37.334
and the first thing she does with it is

24:37.368 --> 24:38.835
join the army?

24:38.869 --> 24:40.303
She serves five years

24:41.038 --> 24:42.205
and then she's discharged

24:42.239 --> 24:45.175
for 'other designated physical
and mental conditions'.

24:45.209 --> 24:49.054
Followed closely by jail time
for transporting weapons.

24:50.781 --> 24:51.915
Her prison psych assessment

24:51.949 --> 24:54.351
mentions complex apocalyptic delusions.

24:55.686 --> 24:57.120
End of the world stuff.

24:59.223 --> 25:00.983
So how'd she pick Jackson Till up?

25:02.293 --> 25:04.294
Colorado State Police said Till's mother

25:04.328 --> 25:05.829
made friends with Sharlene Winston

25:05.863 --> 25:07.063
in the state pen.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.532
Where was Till at the time?

25:10.301 --> 25:11.968
He was in the system.

25:12.002 --> 25:13.870
But already a suspect

25:13.904 --> 25:17.333
in the death of a girl from
a previous foster family.

25:17.842 --> 25:20.377
After the girl transferred to a new home

25:20.911 --> 25:22.379
he found her,

25:22.839 --> 25:24.273
started stalking her.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.517
But no evidence?

25:29.153 --> 25:31.055
Just witnesses to the stalking.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.490
And John,

25:33.524 --> 25:34.724
he had her phone.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.329
He's doing the same thing to Sam.

25:54.745 --> 25:56.179
Sam.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.384
Let's go.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.755
See everyone around you,

26:06.390 --> 26:08.591
and everyone you know,
they're all doomed.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.512
All of this will be destroyed.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.265
I'm here to save you from that.

26:15.299 --> 26:19.019
Please. Please, I-I-I
don't want to be saved.

26:41.625 --> 26:45.129
The first time I saw your art

26:45.930 --> 26:49.132
I knew that you were
someone who could see me,

26:49.166 --> 26:51.801
that you were someone
who could understand

26:51.836 --> 26:53.069
what's inside me.

26:55.806 --> 26:57.182
I don't know you.

26:58.609 --> 27:01.532
You know, Mama won't
like it at first, but,

27:03.698 --> 27:05.281
I could take you to Driftwood Perch.

27:05.316 --> 27:06.983
You could stay there
until I explain to her

27:07.017 --> 27:08.785
that we need to be together.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.635
Sit down.

27:57.334 --> 27:59.335
You think I've done bad things, huh?

28:02.306 --> 28:04.307
But none of that will matter anymore.

28:06.877 --> 28:09.213
Once you meet her,
she'll make you understand.

28:34.104 --> 28:35.838
Wait, wait.

28:36.106 --> 28:38.408
Just tell me where to meet you.

28:38.442 --> 28:39.809
Tell me when and where,

28:39.843 --> 28:41.044
and I'll meet you.

28:43.914 --> 28:45.114
You're lying.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.378
Sam? Is everything okay in there?

28:51.722 --> 28:54.190
It's fine, Jerry. I'm just changing.

28:54.224 --> 28:55.625
I'll be out in a second.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.211
Sam, get down.

29:14.311 --> 29:15.912
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

29:15.946 --> 29:17.146
Just give me,

29:17.781 --> 29:18.982
give me time.

29:19.984 --> 29:21.451
One day.

29:21.485 --> 29:22.719
And you'll see.

29:23.153 --> 29:24.721
Hey this is Jerry.

29:24.755 --> 29:25.922
I need some backup.

29:25.956 --> 29:27.390
My house, right now.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.589
I think I do see.

29:37.301 --> 29:38.501
I think I do.

29:40.137 --> 29:41.337
I do.

29:48.779 --> 29:50.672
But-but-but I-I,

29:50.981 --> 29:54.751
I just need time, okay?

29:54.785 --> 29:56.219
I...

29:56.253 --> 29:57.720
I've been hurt,

29:57.755 --> 30:01.224
and it's-it's hard for
me to trust people.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.759
And-and so, just,

30:02.793 --> 30:04.560
just give me some time, okay?

30:04.595 --> 30:06.195
And tell me where to meet you.

30:26.016 --> 30:27.216
Oh.

30:29.646 --> 30:31.647
You're just like the rest of them.

30:40.831 --> 30:42.832
You'll be sorry when the end comes.

30:57.047 --> 30:58.423
Jerry. He's gone.

31:01.051 --> 31:02.218
You okay?

31:11.061 --> 31:12.261
Are you okay?

31:12.663 --> 31:13.629
You sure?

31:13.664 --> 31:16.699
Okay. Everything's gonna be alright.

31:22.796 --> 31:24.700
He said they were headed north,

31:25.197 --> 31:27.813
that they were going to rebuild society.

31:28.701 --> 31:30.622
It was crazy, everything he said.

31:31.604 --> 31:33.204
Did he say where up north?

31:36.609 --> 31:39.506
He wanted me to know that
everyone else was gonna die.

31:41.013 --> 31:42.581
That he was going to take me to a,

31:42.615 --> 31:44.583
a place called Driftwood Point.

31:44.617 --> 31:47.185
No, um, Driftwood Perch.

31:47.219 --> 31:48.453
Hm.

31:49.322 --> 31:51.101
But you don't know where that is?

32:03.668 --> 32:07.075
He told me that he loved me.

32:12.738 --> 32:15.039
And the weirdest part was that,

32:15.247 --> 32:18.083
he wouldn't stop talking about his Mama.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.167
Bye.

32:43.209 --> 32:44.738
News travels fast.

32:46.078 --> 32:47.579
How are you holding up, Jerry?

32:47.613 --> 32:48.647
Not bad.

32:48.681 --> 32:50.911
Be even better if I
can salvage my dinner.

32:53.386 --> 32:54.458
I'll catch you later.

32:54.493 --> 32:55.587
Yeah.

32:58.791 --> 33:00.425
Does the name 'Driftwood Perch'

33:00.459 --> 33:02.093
mean anything to you?

33:02.641 --> 33:03.841
No.

33:05.197 --> 33:06.398
It sounds like a,

33:06.899 --> 33:08.099
a cottage name.

33:08.801 --> 33:10.402
Yeah.

33:10.436 --> 33:12.404
That's what I thought too.

33:12.438 --> 33:15.073
We have uniforms searching cottage roads.

33:15.107 --> 33:16.307
Mm.

33:17.076 --> 33:18.476
What are you doing here?

33:20.913 --> 33:22.747
I went to see Dr. Bell today.

33:26.485 --> 33:28.561
You shouldn't have done that.

33:28.596 --> 33:30.088
You were supposed to let me handle this.

33:30.122 --> 33:33.091
Listen, I did a search of
all the recent suicides

33:33.125 --> 33:34.192
in Algonquin Bay.

33:34.226 --> 33:37.462
Narrowed it down by who was
having psychiatric care.

33:37.496 --> 33:38.563
And of those,

33:38.597 --> 33:39.998
who was seeing Dr. Bell.

33:40.733 --> 33:43.129
Nine. In under two years.

33:45.504 --> 33:47.305
For all we know that's normal.

33:47.339 --> 33:48.773
Not in Algonquin Bay.

33:50.943 --> 33:52.343
You've talked to Dr. Jones?

33:54.747 --> 33:57.060
I talked to her about the suicide notes.

33:58.684 --> 34:01.519
She couldn't believe he'd
have his patients do that.

34:03.322 --> 34:04.823
She's going to track
down former colleagues,

34:04.857 --> 34:06.858
and see what they have to say.

34:08.594 --> 34:09.793
Thanks.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.766
You're going to finish this case with me?

34:16.168 --> 34:18.002
Do you think you can do that?

34:21.107 --> 34:22.306
Yeah.

34:39.859 --> 34:41.059
Oh.

34:41.994 --> 34:43.194
Go back to sleep.

34:44.196 --> 34:45.630
Sorry I missed it, Kel.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.900
You didn't miss it.

34:51.504 --> 34:52.904
We're doing it now.

34:55.241 --> 34:56.674
So these are $7.50.

34:57.954 --> 34:59.043
Thank you.

34:59.068 --> 35:00.502
It's okay, keep it.

35:04.376 --> 35:05.383
Happy Thanksgiving.

35:05.417 --> 35:06.651
Thanks.

35:31.043 --> 35:32.877
Do you want to say something?

35:37.449 --> 35:38.683
No.

35:41.053 --> 35:42.453
Let's just eat.

35:50.462 --> 35:52.297
Your Aunt Noelle is in here.

35:59.305 --> 36:00.738
What are you doing here?

36:03.642 --> 36:05.276
It's not a good time, Janey.

36:06.278 --> 36:07.649
You look sad.

36:10.282 --> 36:12.116
Well, you know what, I am sad.

36:12.484 --> 36:13.685
Me too.

36:52.224 --> 36:54.057
I saw his picture on the news.

36:55.025 --> 36:56.393
There was just something about him.

36:56.427 --> 36:57.861
What kind of something?

36:57.895 --> 36:59.529
Like the way he looked at me,

36:59.563 --> 37:01.164
the way he talked.

37:01.198 --> 37:02.699
I had nightmares about this guy.

37:02.733 --> 37:04.367
And what do you need to rent a locker

37:04.402 --> 37:05.869
at one of these places?

37:05.903 --> 37:08.138
Uh, photo ID, credit card. That's it.

37:08.172 --> 37:09.172
So if we call around,

37:09.206 --> 37:10.707
we should be able to find
out if the Barstows

37:10.741 --> 37:13.209
rented space anywhere?

37:13.244 --> 37:14.644
Well, I checked for a record of them

37:14.678 --> 37:15.712
at our other facilities.

37:15.746 --> 37:17.147
They didn't rent from us.

37:17.181 --> 37:19.182
There's only three other
places they might've gone.

37:46.310 --> 37:47.444
So, our suspects

37:47.478 --> 37:50.280
Jackson Till and Sharlene Winston,

37:50.314 --> 37:52.348
they now have a large quantity of weapons

37:52.383 --> 37:53.850
in their possession.

37:53.884 --> 37:55.118
Cameras at the storage space

37:55.152 --> 37:57.120
caught Till loading three large cases

37:57.154 --> 37:59.856
into a silver pickup with stolen plates.

37:59.890 --> 38:01.357
We have BOLO's out.

38:01.392 --> 38:04.561
Roadblocks set up on every
road leading out of town.

38:04.595 --> 38:06.930
Units posted at every point of exit-

38:06.964 --> 38:08.965
airport, bus station,

38:08.999 --> 38:10.233
municipal dock.

38:10.267 --> 38:12.702
We don't know why
they're in Algonquin Bay

38:12.736 --> 38:14.871
or what they intend to
do with their arsenal.

38:14.905 --> 38:17.407
But Sharlene Winston is ex-military,

38:17.441 --> 38:19.442
and they've killed four people so far.

38:20.110 --> 38:22.212
We've got names and pictures.

38:22.246 --> 38:24.481
It's time to stop playing
catch-up and find those guns

38:24.515 --> 38:25.949
before someone else dies.

38:59.950 --> 39:00.984
Right there. Thank you.

39:01.018 --> 39:01.985
Alright,

39:15.533 --> 39:16.733
Just got word.

39:17.568 --> 39:19.102
We lost touch with Swanson.

39:19.136 --> 39:21.971
You know that kid we posted
over on the 17th line.

39:22.406 --> 39:23.806
He was shot.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.475
By Jackson Till, looks like.

39:27.978 --> 39:30.143
Thank you Ian. I'll notify the family.

39:45.162 --> 39:46.129
Detective DELORME?

39:46.163 --> 39:47.363
Yeah.

39:48.832 --> 39:49.966
You know that Driftwood Perch

39:50.000 --> 39:51.901
Jackson Till was talking about.

39:51.936 --> 39:53.169
Yeah.

39:54.004 --> 39:55.238
I found the place.

39:55.272 --> 39:58.007
You are not going to believe this.

39:58.042 --> 39:59.676
It's the old Scriver house.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.117
They were here.

41:19.923 --> 41:21.991
The people who lived here,

41:22.026 --> 41:23.226
the Scrivers.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.895
They were that missing persons case,

41:25.929 --> 41:27.797
whole family disappeared.

41:27.831 --> 41:30.900
Yeah, uh, Frank, Dorothy, daughter Amy.

41:30.934 --> 41:33.903
There was blood in the
house but no bodies.

41:33.937 --> 41:35.838
Their boat was missing too

41:35.873 --> 41:37.874
and they never even found that.

41:38.809 --> 41:42.311
If we assume the Scriver
bodies ended up in this water,

41:42.346 --> 41:45.348
it's basically the same
MO as Island Road.

41:47.317 --> 41:49.318
How old was Amy when she disappeared?

41:51.288 --> 41:52.488
Mama, look.

41:53.557 --> 41:54.791
I got 'em.

41:58.729 --> 42:00.163
Did you kill that cop?

42:03.200 --> 42:05.506
I tried, I did.

42:06.737 --> 42:08.504
That old cottage you took us to,

42:08.539 --> 42:09.972
she's there right now.

42:11.508 --> 42:12.909
I tried to take her down but,

42:13.877 --> 42:16.184
it would have brought
them all down on us.

42:16.980 --> 42:18.014
Lemur was right,

42:18.048 --> 42:19.982
we should have burned
that house to the ground.

42:25.861 --> 42:27.061
It's like you said,

42:30.561 --> 42:32.862
enough to fight the war.

42:36.567 --> 42:37.767
Enough to win.

42:38.305 --> 42:44.914
