00:59.840 --> 01:04.117
Don't raise your voice, men don't like
women who raise their voices.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.913
Remember to always say a kind word,
and cook him good food.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.756
Don't forget to put on perfume,
and to keep your body smooth,

01:15.040 --> 01:18.077
so that when he desires you,
he'll know where to ﬁnd you.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.150
In bed, do what he tells you.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.910
Don't let on that you
know what you're doing.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.514
Cheers, cheers!

01:48.800 --> 01:51.473
Who's got the stuff?
- I do.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.918
That's all you got, Ritalin?

01:56.960 --> 01:59.793
Girl, it's the hot thing in town.
Crush it!

02:01.800 --> 02:03.597
Slut, where did you get that?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.557
Give it back.
- Who's it from this time?

02:05.680 --> 02:08.830
Saleh, give it back.
- You run on dope and scheming.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.235
Fucker!
You live at my expense and complain?

02:11.560 --> 02:14.279
Give me a cigarette.
Soon I won't even be able to smoke!

02:14.560 --> 02:17.757
Here, burn your lungs
like there's no tomorrow.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.633
When you move to that
fancy villa of yours in Kufr Yasif,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.517
you'll need the mayor's permission
to light up.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.593
Bring it on!

02:29.520 --> 02:30.919
Hey bro, when did you get here?

02:32.440 --> 02:34.829
Sorry, I thought this is the bathroom.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.598
See you later.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.953
Who's he?

02:43.960 --> 02:46.633
Cheers! To the end of singlehood...

02:55.560 --> 02:57.039
Who's she?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.433
Layla, a friend.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.029
Man, I'm going to miss these outings.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.069
Where's that slut?
We want to keep going!

03:26.040 --> 03:27.837
There she is.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.633
Where to? -"Shessek. "
Shall we catch a cab?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.114
What's happening at "Shessek"?

03:36.280 --> 03:40.159
Your playlist tonight was legendary.
- Really?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.039
Yes, Mom.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.197
Good morning dear, still sleeping?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.556
I have a day off.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.229
Okay, just remember that next week
your cousin's friend is coming to see you.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.950
Okay, Mom. I'll be there, you don't
have to call every day to remind me.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.794
Wear a dress this time,
you look good in dresses.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.953
Try to cover those drawings on your body,
and remove that earring from your nose!

04:46.240 --> 04:48.959
Will you stop nagging about that?

04:49.040 --> 04:50.758
Okay.
- Bye.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.670
Morning.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.349
My head is going to explode.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.074
Do me a favor,
make me some coffee.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.315
Tell me about it...

05:31.720 --> 05:32.630
Thanks.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.111
Sweetie, who are you looking for?

05:56.920 --> 06:00.674
I'm Nour,
your ﬂatmate Raﬁf is my cousin.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.553
Didn't she tell you I'm coming today?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.559
Ah... Nour.
Welcome, come in.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.949
Yeah, welcome.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.791
Come in, dear.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.754
Welcome, Nour.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.714
What do you study?

06:33.120 --> 06:34.155
Computer Science.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.673
It's my last semester,
I have ﬁnals now.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.393
Did you live in the dorms?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.792
Yeah, but they're renovating
and it's noisy.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.871
Raﬁf, bless her, said she'd talk to you
about staying here until I ﬁnd a place.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.430
Yeah, darling Raﬁf.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.873
Come, I'll show you your room.

06:54.200 --> 06:58.159
I'm Salma Zaatary from Tarshiha,
and this is Layla Sakher from Nazareth.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.439
You're not from Haifa like Raﬁf, right?

07:02.680 --> 07:03.954
No, I'm from Umm Al-Fahem.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.159
My aunt, Raﬁf's mother,
married a man from Haifa.

07:08.120 --> 07:08.950
Nice...

07:09.400 --> 07:12.710
You can let go of your suitcase,
we won't snatch it.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.192
It has my laptop and stuff.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.511
DIWAN, TAWFIQ ZAYYAE

08:12.440 --> 08:14.874
It's the ﬁrst time I see you like this!

08:14.960 --> 08:16.791
Turn around, let me see.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.954
Stunning.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.832
Layla, what are you talking about?
My tits are hanging out!

08:22.960 --> 08:24.712
Wow! Look at this.

08:25.720 --> 08:30.271
There'a a picture of my mom in
a dress just like this, at my age.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.359
Those were the days...

08:33.120 --> 08:36.192
Back then everyone was Communist.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.828
But Communism is dead and buried,
soulmate!

08:40.360 --> 08:44.353
Neither dead nor buried.
I'm a living example, soulmate!

08:44.960 --> 08:47.315
Sure, you can go on being
the idiot who lives upon its ruins.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.839
Ooooh...

08:50.120 --> 08:52.350
Communism, schmonunism.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.557
Got a dollar, you're worth a dollar.
Got nothing, you're worth nothing.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.312
Look how pretty this is!

09:01.640 --> 09:03.232
Try it on, Laila.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.798
Right? Look!

09:06.800 --> 09:08.313
Excuse me,
where's the ﬁtting room?

09:09.600 --> 09:10.157
There.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.272
Mother's cunt...

09:18.560 --> 09:19.834
We don't bite.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.191
This is the last one I'm trying on.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.308
Why wear that one, dear?
You have many cheery dresses.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.311
Wear one of them.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.719
Your aunt is right.
Enough with the black!

10:01.800 --> 10:04.553
You wear black every day,
today wear something else!

10:04.760 --> 10:06.193
Okay, Mom, but no promises.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.351
Don't drive me crazy
if it doesn't work out.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.273
We're not that backward.

10:10.440 --> 10:15.594
You can meet with him once, twice,
three times, within reason, of course.

10:15.720 --> 10:16.835
lnshallah, it'll work out.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.271
I only want you to be happy.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.595
What more could I ask for?

10:20.760 --> 10:24.469
lnshallah, it will work out
and he'll be a decent man.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.875
You heard right, Abu George.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.314
Yours truly,
sells 1,000 chickens a day.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.828
A thousand chickens!

10:40.960 --> 10:43.758
Not to mention that I market to
50 supermarkets in the north!

10:44.120 --> 10:46.429
Well done.
- Thank you.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.394
What Salma doesn't know,

10:49.760 --> 10:51.398
is that I'm building a house
that overlooks all the town!

10:52.720 --> 10:54.392
400 square meters!

10:54.680 --> 10:56.671
Welcome, Jamil.
- Thank you, Auntie!

10:57.040 --> 10:59.508
Why didn't you ﬁnish the pudding?
Didn't you like it?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.875
On the contrary!
It's delicious, thank you.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.473
I put in extra carobs for you.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.154
God bless you,
you shouldn't have troubled yourself.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.196
Go ahead, help yourself.
- Thank you.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.156
Salma, shall I cut you some grapefruit?
- No.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.279
In the name of the cross.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.391
Raﬁf's movie is over.
The end.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.832
At least she changed genre
from action to melodrama.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.479
Come on, where is that princess?

11:50.440 --> 11:52.112
Did you tell her where we parked?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.549
Of course, I did.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.954
But she needs ﬁve hours
just to close the jilbab...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.509
Come on, for God's sake.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.711
There she is.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.435
What the hell...

12:12.200 --> 12:15.033
Wow.
- Oh my God.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.318
Let me help you.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.353
There's no room, sweetie.
Put it on the backseat, next to you.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.233
Loosen up, girl.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.510
Loosen up for God's sake.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.959
Give me that.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.599
Oh, God help me.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.752
Check out her IO.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.030
That's it, I can't watch anymore.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.270
Hello.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.872
Emad, friend of the groom.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.316
Laila, friend of the bride.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.719
How about a joint?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.516
Hello to you, Nazarene girl!

14:25.960 --> 14:27.154
Last hit?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.154
Are you kidding me?!

14:48.640 --> 14:49.550
Morning.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.068
Good morning.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.237
I've heard of dawn prayers,
not morning prayers!

15:06.840 --> 15:08.717
How the hell should I know...

15:12.840 --> 15:14.478
Good morning to you too.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.711
Good morning.
- Good morning.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.195
Is it okay if my ﬁance
comes over tonight?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.199
Sweetie, do you see a sign
that says "women only" here?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.952
Bring whoever you like.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.879
Do you want us out of the house?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.479
What don't you get, Salma?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.110
Anyway, I have a ton of work.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.155
Salma, move your ass, I gotta go.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.949
I'm coming.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.354
Layla Shaker in the Magistrate's Court!

16:19.960 --> 16:21.837
See what money can do?

16:21.960 --> 16:22.949
Horrifying.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.191
Gimme a light.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.670
So Layla, what's up?

16:35.320 --> 16:37.914
If we're talking business...
- Give it a rest!

16:39.480 --> 16:42.358
Let's close the Bouhbout case,
once and for all.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.793
With the evidence I have in this case,
I'm going for prison time.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.313
That's what I can tell you.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.916
I have no problem reaching
evidentiary proceedings, Jonathan.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.638
Be my guest.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.670
But it'll be a shame.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.072
I say, let's close a deal here and now.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.436
So what are you ready to offer me?

17:09.240 --> 17:14.473
You retract your charges and he signs
a no-offense commitment for ﬁve years.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.949
Fair enough.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.792
You have it all worked out, huh?

17:18.240 --> 17:19.194
Always.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.355
Okay, you got it.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.954
But this deal includes the dinner
you promised but never delivered.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.075
Darling.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.315
Darling...

17:43.800 --> 17:45.916
Give me a break,
we both know it's a waste of time.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.029
Why a waste of time?

17:47.320 --> 17:49.914
Your mother, Mrs. Halevy...
- God bless her.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.349
Won't rest until she gets
a kosher Jewish bride.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.079
Come on Layla, let's go with the ﬂow,
who knows tomorrow Peace might erupt...

17:57.320 --> 17:59.709
And we'll hit the streets and do
Palestinian folk dances together?!

18:00.600 --> 18:03.672
Jonathan, let it go,
you're not built for it.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.955
Let's keep our ﬂirtation fun.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.072
Salma, gimme two lemons, please.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.112
Not now Yasser,
I have a ton of work.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.599
The dish will burn!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.598
Hakmat, gimme two lemons, please.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.477
Fuck you, it fell on the ﬂoor.
Throw me another one.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.595
What?!

18:46.120 --> 18:48.031
You know the rules!

18:48.120 --> 18:50.190
I'm telling you again,
I don't want to hear Arabic!

18:50.440 --> 18:53.113
It's unpleasant for the customers,
who just want to enjoy their meal,

18:53.360 --> 18:54.475
to hear you yelling in Arabic!

18:54.760 --> 18:55.749
Enough!

18:55.920 --> 18:59.799
Are the customers who "just want to
enjoy their meal," allergic to Arabic?

19:00.360 --> 19:03.397
Salma! Shut up and go back to work.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.959
Neither of us make the rules around here.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.674
If you dare talk to me like that ever again,

19:09.040 --> 19:10.268
you don't want to know what I'll do!

19:10.640 --> 19:12.756
What will you do,
go on a hunger strike?

19:13.440 --> 19:15.556
You fucker!
Making fun of me, are you?

19:15.760 --> 19:18.035
Okay...
- Salma!

19:21.520 --> 19:24.273
Have it your way.
- Salma, just tell him you're...

19:25.480 --> 19:26.469
What else could I do?

19:26.560 --> 19:32.829
The bastards planted in my cell a...
What do you call it in Arabic, "asfour"?

19:32.960 --> 19:37.397
A motherfucking snitch,
started talking about people I know,

19:37.480 --> 19:39.152
how could I suspect?

19:40.600 --> 19:44.275
Telling stories that only two people
in town know, and one of them is me.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.272
Spare me...

19:46.480 --> 19:50.359
But every dog has his day.
God willing, he'll get what he deserves.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.316
I'll get back to you later, bye.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.276
Qays!

19:56.280 --> 19:57.030
Layla?

19:58.720 --> 19:59.596
You ignoring my calls?

20:01.080 --> 20:02.957
You pest, I was at work!
What do you want?

20:03.080 --> 20:03.956
You and your work...

20:04.120 --> 20:06.873
Tiny Fingers are playing "The Block,"
want a ticket?

20:07.640 --> 20:08.959
Sure, sounds good.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.155
Chill out!

20:13.800 --> 20:15.950
Okay, I'll call you later.
- Bye.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.432
As-salaamu alaykum
- Wa alaykum salaam, Nour.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.672
Are you in Tel Aviv?
- Almost, what's the address?

20:36.200 --> 20:38.350
The neighborhood is called
"Yemeni Quarter. "

20:38.680 --> 20:39.635
What's it near?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.312
Near the Hassan Bek Mosque,
in what used to be Manshiyeh.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.595
Okay, I'm on my way.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.155
Couldn't your cousin Raﬁf,
may God guide her,

22:29.280 --> 22:31.396
ﬁnd a ﬂat that's not
in the center of Tel Aviv?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.796
I told you our people in the
charitable society are ready to help.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.873
All I have to do is ask.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.192
We talked about this, Wissam.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.678
Jaffa is too far from the university,
it'll take me two hours each way.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.279
What can I say.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.118
It's all temporary, either way.

22:51.120 --> 22:55.557
Oh yeah, I talked to my uncle, Abu Fuad,
who talked to his friend, the headmaster.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.634
He promised to give you a job at his school.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.273
Even though as far as I'm concerned,
it would be better if you stayed home.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.751
You know that a single salary isn't enough,
I have to help you.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.950
The prophet, peace be upon Him, said:

23:15.760 --> 23:19.878
"Do not prevent your women from
going to the mosque," though what?

23:21.240 --> 23:23.595
"Though their homes
be better for them. "

23:23.880 --> 23:25.233
I don't need help.

23:25.920 --> 23:30.948
The best help would be you staying at
home and raising the children properly.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.357
Anything you want will come to you.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.469
Hello.
- Peace be upon you.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.677
Salma, this is Wissam, my ﬁance.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.836
Salma Zaatary from Tarshiha.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.950
Drive safe.
May God protect you.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.431
Oops, sorry.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.112
It's okay.

24:18.360 --> 24:21.033
I ask God forgiveness for all sins.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.194
May God forgive all sins.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.875
I'll think of something, a solution.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.553
lnshallah, it will work out.

24:48.160 --> 24:48.831
Look!

24:49.080 --> 24:52.356
"Arab protesters attacked the police... "

24:52.480 --> 24:54.550
What did you expect them to write,
the truth?

24:55.880 --> 24:56.437
Stop it.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.192
Is that your new ﬁatmate?

25:05.160 --> 25:06.639
Yeah, we got a new ﬁatmate.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.869
I thought Raﬁf's cousin
was going to move in.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.473
What's with the face?

25:13.560 --> 25:15.755
Fuck off, Rabe'a.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.710
Nour, he's asking about you.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.354
Come sit with us.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.035
No, thanks.
I have to study and get up early.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.757
All you do is study, darling?

25:31.240 --> 25:34.471
Trust me, you won't ﬁnd a professor
hotter than me, come sit with us.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.829
Hello people.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.876
What's with the funeral faces?

25:42.880 --> 25:44.108
Hello.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.476
This is Ziad,
from my hometown Taybeh.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.835
He's my cousin's friend,
and my ﬁatmate from today.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.351
Rabe'a! -Hi!
- I'm Salma.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.515
Make yourself comfortable.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.796
Come sit, Ziad.
- Hi.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.472
What will you drink?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.712
A beer.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.195
Me too.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.676
Look what he's doing to him.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.273
Good evening.
- Good evening.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.596
Oh my, the queen is home.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.071
Queen my ass...

26:30.040 --> 26:30.836
Look!

26:33.080 --> 26:36.277
Did you see the guy from Taybeh
sitting there? He's hot!

26:36.480 --> 26:39.631
He's okay.
- You wish!

26:45.680 --> 26:47.636
Why the sad face?

26:47.720 --> 26:50.109
Nothing, I had a shitty day
and I feel like dying.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.515
What else is new...

26:53.720 --> 26:55.836
Oh, you haven't been introduced.

26:56.040 --> 26:56.950
Hello, Ziad.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.309
How are you, Layla?
Can I shake your hand?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.875
How do you like the music?
- It's cool.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.435
Here.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.199
Thanks.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.276
So, what brought you to this city?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.115
Life, just like everybody else.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.351
Is there no life in Taybeh?

27:59.160 --> 28:03.233
Yeah, but I don't really remember.
I haven't lived there in a long time.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.148
Why, where have you been?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.794
In New York.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.111
Cool.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.634
What did you do there?

28:18.960 --> 28:21.030
I studied ﬁlm and worked in production.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.154
And you, what's your story?

28:33.120 --> 28:36.669
I'm a very long story...

28:39.840 --> 28:43.071
I just remembered...
I got some good stuff inside.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.959
Want some?

28:47.880 --> 28:50.155
Depends how good.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.189
There's no one inside.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.874
I guess they went out.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.794
Thanks.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.398
You should come with a warning sign.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.152
"Danger! Electrifying!"

30:44.400 --> 30:46.197
I wonder if it'll hit fast.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.271
That's what we want.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.590
I'm starting to feel it... You?

31:23.280 --> 31:28.115
This stuff is a motherfucker.

33:10.960 --> 33:14.350
I haven't felt my heart
in such a long time!

33:15.280 --> 33:16.349
What?

33:16.760 --> 33:18.751
I've rediscovered it.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.110
Praise to God.
- Indeed.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.429
What about you?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.078
Are you happy with your ﬁance?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.630
We've been together
for a year and a half.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.837
He's from a good family and...
- Do you love him, Nour?

34:02.760 --> 34:06.070
You know,
the important thing is getting along.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.039
Love comes through companionship.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.632
That naughty Wissam!

34:19.719 --> 34:20.630
Hi!

34:21.080 --> 34:22.559
I saw you're looking for a bartender.

34:22.880 --> 34:23.790
Is the manager here?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.433
He went to get hummus,
he'll be right back.

34:25.679 --> 34:26.590
You looking for work?

34:27.239 --> 34:28.639
A couple of minutes.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.909
Want a shot?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.592
Totally.

34:45.639 --> 34:47.755
Are you South American?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.196
I'm Palestinian.

34:50.639 --> 34:51.914
Wow, cool.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.478
Okay, cheers!
- Cheers.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.958
Layla.
- Yes?

35:09.880 --> 35:11.438
Why did you go silent all of a sudden?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.559
Oh, it's nothing.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.592
I realized that Ziad and I have
been together for a while now.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.952
And this is the ﬁrst time
that I cook for him.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.117
It's been a while since
I cooked for someone.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.235
How does it feel?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.637
Kind of scary.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.794
I thought you'd say joyous.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.276
Don't worry,
I'm the one cooking.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.388
I always cook for Wissam,
nothing scary about it.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.431
It'll make you feel good, trust me.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.433
I won't tell anyone.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.033
You have to take it into your lungs.

36:11.760 --> 36:12.749
Inhale.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.072
No, this isn't for me.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.310
Damn, we burned the onions.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.749
Damn, get another onion.
I'll do it again fast.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.429
Noun
- Yeah.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.513
I found you a place to live.
- In Jaffa?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.550
Yeah, in Jaffa.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.237
All right, what's the address?
Gaza st 1

36:42.520 --> 36:45.159
Go there now.
- Yes, Wissam, I'll go.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.671
Thank God this one is leaving.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.555
Never in my life have I seen such a mess.
How can she live like this?

37:14.120 --> 37:16.634
I guess it's a musicians' thing.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.110
As-salaamu alaykum.
- Wa alaykum salaam.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.510
Did you go?
- Yeah, how are you?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.592
Praise be to God.
Did you like the ﬂat?

37:24.800 --> 37:28.190
It's okay. We'll talk later.
- Okay.

37:30.440 --> 37:34.911
The rent includes electricity,
water, and municipal taxes.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.758
Praise to God.
- Where are you from?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.951
From Umm Al-Fahem.
- Welcome.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.835
To you, Layla Sakher.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.157
To you, Ziad Hamdi.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.629
Would you like some salad?

37:55.400 --> 37:56.355
Sure, a little.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.199
Is it good?

38:12.800 --> 38:14.279
Did you really cook this?

38:15.360 --> 38:16.679
Who else?

38:18.960 --> 38:23.351
I hope you won't feed me
potatoes and eggs, later on.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.595
I hope you'll always know
how to choose wine.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.957
None of the girls are here?

39:17.760 --> 39:19.159
I love you, Layla.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.159
I love you.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.840
Can you turn it down?
I'm trying to study!

40:05.400 --> 40:08.278
I'm going to DJ a big rave.
It's my ﬁrst time, I have to prepare.

40:08.760 --> 40:09.829
What's a rave?

40:10.080 --> 40:10.910
Nevermind, use headphones.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.757
I want to ﬁnish studying
before Wissam comes.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.509
But the headphones are broken, Nour.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.556
Since I'm not studying,
you're going to help me clean.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.234
Now?! -God knows when
you cleaned the house last...

40:48.160 --> 40:50.549
Wissam's on his way and I'm not dressed.
How long do you need?

40:50.680 --> 40:51.829
A few minutes.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.957
A many minutes is a "few"?

40:54.280 --> 40:56.510
I'm done, I swear.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.678
Hello.
- Where are you?

41:03.840 --> 41:05.671
I'm sick of this city!
I'm stuck in trafﬁc.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.593
No problem, I have to hang up.
- Nour!

41:16.480 --> 41:17.879
What's wrong?

41:18.960 --> 41:19.836
I'm done.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.235
Don't worry!

41:22.840 --> 41:24.592
I ruined the food.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.590
It's on me.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.949
Thanks.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.479
Salma.
- Dunya.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.511
How about you come over for coffee?

42:15.280 --> 42:16.235
Cheers.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.838
What do you mean you don't want
to move up the wedding date?

42:37.200 --> 42:38.952
I found you another ﬁat,
you didn't want it.

42:39.040 --> 42:42.191
I told you we can get married and
I'll drive you every day, like a queen.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.112
You don't want that either?!

42:44.320 --> 42:47.949
You know I'm under a lot of stress
because of my studies and exams.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.917
It's not a good time to get married.

42:50.040 --> 42:54.716
I don't want you to stay in this city,
especially not in this house.

43:05.040 --> 43:05.870
Okay.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.680
If you don't want to change
the wedding date, ﬁne.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.718
But move to Jaffa and I'll buy you a car,
so you can drive to the university.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.678
Until you get through
the next few months.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.432
But I'm happy here with the girls.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.916
They're not like you think,
they're very good.

43:23.280 --> 43:28.513
They've ruined you to the point that
you don't see how impure they are.

43:31.320 --> 43:34.392
You've started eating the garbage they do!

43:48.240 --> 43:49.719
Where is the bathroom?

44:07.600 --> 44:08.555
Nouﬂ

44:09.640 --> 44:11.312
What is this?

44:12.560 --> 44:13.754
What is this?!

44:16.600 --> 44:19.273
I'm sure you know,
you've become a whore, like them.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.279
You know very well I'm not!
Layla and Salma also aren't...

44:22.400 --> 44:24.470
Shut your mouth!
I don't want to hear!

44:26.880 --> 44:30.475
Start packing, you're coming home
with me to Umm Al-Fahem, right now!

45:06.760 --> 45:07.909
Enough.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.829
Enough, Nour.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.110
You know how much I love you?

45:42.960 --> 45:44.154
Wissam, what...

45:58.800 --> 46:00.028
What are you doing?

46:06.200 --> 46:07.633
Wissam, let me go.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.913
Sweet Dunia!

48:19.960 --> 48:21.313
What a shitty shift!

48:21.400 --> 48:23.436
Fuck it.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.074
Layla... -Yeah?
Layla...

48:52.160 --> 48:56.438
Any chance you catch a cab,
and I continue with her?

49:04.840 --> 49:05.955
You're going to get...

49:08.440 --> 49:08.838
Fool!

49:09.880 --> 49:13.031
Okay, I'm leaving, cool?

49:13.120 --> 49:14.269
Yes, cool.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.548
Bye, beautiful!
- Bye.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.834
Get home safe.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.948
In the daytime,
she's mostly normal.

49:27.800 --> 49:28.835
Poor thing!

49:29.600 --> 49:30.828
Come on, Layla...

49:32.880 --> 49:33.835
I have to go...

49:34.320 --> 49:35.355
It was a nice evening.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.631
We'll do coffee, yeah?
- Perfect.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.308
Layla, are you okay?
Sure?

49:46.400 --> 49:47.549
Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:51.240 --> 49:54.232
I'm gonna be so hung over tomorrow...

49:54.920 --> 49:57.912
Fuck!
- Quiet, Nour is sleeping.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.432
Layla, you okay?

50:07.560 --> 50:09.516
Come here right now!

50:28.040 --> 50:29.268
Asshole!

50:32.480 --> 50:35.233
Get up, sweetie.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.357
Lift your arms up, sweetie.

52:12.840 --> 52:16.116
Careful, it's hot.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.552
What should we do?

53:38.920 --> 53:41.036
Hello?
- As-salaamu alaykum.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.875
Peace and God's mercy upon you,
who is this?

53:44.160 --> 53:48.199
To be honest you don't know me,
but I've heard a lot about you.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.630
How good and pious you are.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.713
Praise be to God.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.439
How can I help you?

53:56.280 --> 53:58.191
I can't talk about it on the phone...

53:58.440 --> 54:01.955
But I can only turn to you or God for help,
after what happened to me.

54:02.240 --> 54:05.471
Okay sister, take it easy,
and God will help.

54:05.600 --> 54:06.953
I'll be at the charitable society
in two days.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.954
Come see me,
and all will be ﬁne, God willing.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.635
The day after tomorrow?

54:11.960 --> 54:13.916
I'll be at my aunt's house
the day after tomorrow.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.793
We can meet wherever you like,
whatever works for you.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.919
The blue house next to Andre's.
I have to hang up now.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.109
May God be with you.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.873
Pious my ass.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.948
Sugar?

54:42.720 --> 54:44.836
I didn't add any sugar
cuz you didn't answer.

54:45.440 --> 54:48.079
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- Is everything okay?

54:48.320 --> 54:49.355
Yeah.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.358
Please...
- Thanks.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.077
How do you like Tel Aviv?

55:04.320 --> 55:06.072
ljust moved here,
but I don't really like it.

55:06.920 --> 55:07.875
Obviously.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.160
This city is confusing, shocking.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.630
If it wasn't for the hospital residency,
I never would've left Haifa.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.070
It's mellow there,
in a way I can't explain.

55:17.720 --> 55:18.675
I can.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.433
It's called lethargy.

55:25.560 --> 55:28.916
What about you?
Is every night at work a drinking night?

55:29.360 --> 55:32.511
No, personally I don't like
to drink at work.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.392
But last night was special.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.151
We specialize in watering the broken hearted.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.950
They gather for a bitter drop
at the end of the night.

55:40.240 --> 55:43.357
As Abu Nuwas said:
"Cure me with my ailment. "

55:47.640 --> 55:49.312
Do your parents know you're a lesbian?

55:52.120 --> 55:55.510
I embarrassed you!
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

55:55.880 --> 55:58.758
I speak before I think,
then I say sorry. Sorry.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.951
Sorry.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.550
Wow, Layla.
I wouldn't have recognized you.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.588
I wouldn't have recognized myself.

56:54.520 --> 56:56.158
What do you say, Nour?

56:58.080 --> 57:00.799
To be honest, it really suits you.
- What?!

57:05.720 --> 57:08.439
I would never have recognized you.

57:14.600 --> 57:17.273
Congratulations, girl.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.915
This calls for a joint, no?

57:20.280 --> 57:22.953
Yeah, gimme a hit.
I can't hear myself.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.833
And your father?
- May he rest in peace.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.474
Only God has the might and power.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.758
Are you okay?

57:48.200 --> 57:52.955
God damn him,
my body hurts all over.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.675
From the beatings?

58:08.440 --> 58:10.954
Of course, from the beatings.

58:17.400 --> 58:21.393
He has the hands of a construction worker.

58:25.920 --> 58:29.230
Look what he did to me.

58:31.920 --> 58:34.036
lnshallah, it will be okay.

58:34.280 --> 58:37.158
You see? It's all swollen.
- Don't worry.

58:38.320 --> 58:42.836
Show me what that bastard did.
- There, look at the back.

59:06.600 --> 59:09.034
My love, how are you?

59:12.360 --> 59:17.036
What? Don't you remember we
reserved a table on Monteﬁore?

59:17.760 --> 59:19.273
Didn't we say we'd talk?

59:20.360 --> 59:22.271
Well, if you'd answered my calls...

59:22.520 --> 59:26.593
Didn't you get my message that
I'm getting dressed and coming to get you?

59:26.680 --> 59:28.398
Ziad, is everything okay?

59:28.680 --> 59:29.874
I'll be right there.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.597
Hello.
- My sister, Hanan.

59:42.960 --> 59:45.758
Hello. -Hello.
- Layla Sakher.

59:45.840 --> 59:46.670
Pleasure to meet you.

59:48.640 --> 59:50.517
Hanan, don't be shy.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.671
Layla's a lawyer,
she understands these things.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.270
Darling, get her a glass of water please.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.508
Want a cigarette?
- No.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.955
They caught my son with grass last night.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.035
They arrested him,
his father went to see him,

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.475
after one of his friends
told us what happened.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.910
I still have no idea what's going on.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.153
I really want to help you,
but I'll need more details.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.956
Who was there?
Where did it happen?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.758
Does he have a police record?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.035
No, my Jamil is a good boy.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.199
But those good for nothing thugs
he's been hanging out with lately,

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.198
may God take them,
are nothing but trouble.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.953
If this is his ﬁrst time,
and he was caught with a small amount,

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.069
and has no previous record,
they'll close the case with a warning.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.390
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.397
Hanan, you didn't drink anything,
how about some coffee?

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.317
Layla, can you make us coffee?

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.030
My pleasure.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.308
Do you drink your coffee with no sugar,
like Ziad?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.754
A bit of sugar.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.553
Are you going to keep
that sour face all day?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.552
Just because I met your sister.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.951
Layla, maybe you should quit smoking,
what do you think?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.071
Where did that come from?

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.473
Why, do you want to quit too?

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.755
Maybe.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.233
What else?
Should I stop getting high?

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.115
Or dressing like this?
What exactly is on the list?

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.597
Enough, Layla.
You know what I'm talking about.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.233
Did you have to smoke in front of her?
Couldn't you restrain yourself?

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.788
Restrain myself?!

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.508
What do you mean by that?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.954
You're talking about a cigarette...
Are you for real?!

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.113
Your nephew was arrested yesterday
and you're talking about a cigarette?

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.395
Don't play stupid.
You know exactly what I'm saying.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.312
Okay, so if I have to give up smoking,

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.950
and dressing as I do,
not to mention partying at night,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.152
what are you planning to give up, Ziad?

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.837
Where do you think we're living,
in Europe?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.277
Taybeh isn't Europe, baby.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.436
As the saying goes:
"Dress as people want, but eat what you want. "

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.597
This is our reality, that's that.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.198
So what happens if I eat what I want,
and dress as I want?

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.914
Too much for you?

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.954
You want to change the world in one day?

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.077
I got news for you, don't count on it.
It won't happen, it's a waste of time.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.029
Ziad...

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.755
I have only one thing to tell you.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.510
I won't change my choices in life.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.360
Either you accept me as I am or...

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.192
It's over.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.079
Welcome to Tarshiha village!

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.958
This my high school.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.674
Do you see the lemon tree?
- Yeah.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.958
My ﬁrst kiss, right there.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.959
Fuck, that was a long time ago.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.029
With a girl? Respect!
- Are you kidding?!

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.396
It was with a boy a year older,
I wanted to kiss like in the movies.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.911
Poor thing, he was in love.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.959
Crazy girl.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.749
Salma?

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.269
Hello, Umm Jiries.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.956
How are you?
- I'm ﬁne, and you?

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.319
I'm ﬁne.
We miss you around here.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.435
Hi, Mom.
- Welcome.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.755
What took you so long?

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.399
I missed you, what a nice dress.
- I wore it especially for you.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.471
Hello, I'm Dunya.
- Nice to meet you.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.909
She didn't mention you were coming.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.116
May I use your bathroom?
- Go ahead.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.789
You didn't tell me that
you're bringing guests.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.268
Does she know what's
happening tonight?

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.952
Mom, it's just a dinner.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.679
Just a dinner...

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.756
Uncle, I'm thinking of moving up
the wedding date.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.437
And what does Nour say?
- Nour doesn't want to.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.391
Hurry up girls, the men must be
hungry after the Friday prayers.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.679
Abu Mahmoud, the food is ready,
come to the table.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.751
Call Abu Khalil in Haifa, and he'll come.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.435
Yes, talk to him...
- Okay, let's go eat.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:21.398
Please, go ahead.
- No, after you.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.077
The Sheikh's sermon was excellent today.
- Yes, he is a respectable Sheikh.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.153
I also liked him, to be honest.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.239
How are you?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.589
Praise be to God.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.954
Bless your hands for the food,

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.115
Umm Mahmoud.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:06:59.757
Bon appetite.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.154
God bless your hands, Auntie!

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.597
Wissam, how are things
at the charitable society?

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.678
I'm sure there's plenty of work.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.156
What can I say, Abu Mahmoud,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.352
People are barely getting by,
the economic situation is bad.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.796
The list of people in need
just keeps growing.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.273
May God empower us to do good,
lnshallah.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.632
You didn't tell me,
how's the house construction going?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.591
It's going exactly as planned,
praise be to God.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.232
Hopefully in two months,
Nour and I will...

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.389
choose our furniture.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.188
Nour, darling, don't scrimp and save.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.788
Choose the most expensive!

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.349
Abu Wissam has stacks of cash
hidden in the ﬂoorboards.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.952
Floorboards! You mean he needs
an entire bank to manage his accounts.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.958
Believe me father,
some people live in palaces,

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.594
but God knows
what their life is like inside.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.189
It's a pleasure to have you, Umm Elias!

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.590
Thank you!
- What an honor! -Likewise.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:27.038
Do you like the food, Umm Elias?

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.279
Delicious!
Bless you, what a cook!

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.876
Elias, dear, your mother tells me
you're an engineer, is that right?

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.595
A mechanical engineer at Delta Carmiel.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:47.429
Elias, may Christ bless him,

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.915
has never lived away from home.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:53.636
Even after he was offered a job
in Haifa, with free housing!

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.670
Ask me why.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.913
Why?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.916
Because family is above all.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.912
When you have a family like ours,
why move out?

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.118
Darling, your mother tells me
that you're a music teacher.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.752
Yes, a music teacher.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.188
A teacher would be
the best thing for my son.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.394
I always wanted a bride with a good job.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.710
What's better than a teacher?

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.599
You come home at 2pm,
and still have enough time

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.318
to cook for the husband and kids,
before they return.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:23.839
That's the best.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.312
Dunya, where did you say you're from,
Haifa, right?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.638
What do you do,
are you a teacher like Salma?

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.912
No, not a teacher. I'm a doctor.
And Salma's neighbor.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.154
A doctor in Tel-Aviv?!

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.273
Are there no hospitals in Haifa,
that you have to go all the way there?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.676
I'm doing my residency at lchilov Hospital.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.798
Bless you. -Bless her.
- lchilov is an excellent hospital.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:56.149
It's one of the best in the country.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.755
If only the hospitals in the north
were as good.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.918
Welcome, welcome!

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.913
To you, Abu Elias!
To everyone, again.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.313
To everyone,
to the bachelors and bachelorettes!

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.512
Welcome to our home,
and hopefully to our family!

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.717
Cheers. -Cheers!
- Welcome!

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.430
So, Umm George, don't we deserve
a nice cup of your homemade coffee?

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.033
Of course you do! The best coffee.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.509
Salma will get the dessert.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.276
Umm George, I can't have you making
the coffee while I'm here, let me make it.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.874
That's nice of you, go ahead!

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.554
To be honest, the groom's curls
are prettier than mine.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.558
Lucky guy, did you like him?
- Jealous? Want him for yourself?

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.073
Delta Carmiel, he says.
- Quiet, they'll hear us.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.069
Don't play with ﬁre.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.908
I have to change this radio.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.270
I see you changed the way
you cover your hair.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.668
I like it this way.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.872
I like it too.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.949
The important thing is, what do you
think about moving up the wedding?

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.277
No.
- Why not?

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.756
Because I don't love you.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.758
Did you see his mother's tits?

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.037
They're as big as the groom's head.
- Have mercy.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.949
George couldn't take his eyes off them.
- Your brother embarrassed us.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.350
That poor cross was stuck there,
couldn't get out.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.075
You're crazy.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:54.950
Salma!

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.750
Stand up so I can see you!

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.678
Dunya, pack your things
and go catch the bus.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.236
Don't let me hear that you talked to Salma,
or even called her.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.196
Because if you do,
you will pay for it.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.156
Go!

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.719
But Mom,
you know I have to go with her.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.428
You stay here,
your father wants to talk to you.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.394
You, come with me!

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.753
Sit down.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.951
Can you explain to me exactly
what it is your mother told me?

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.109
Speak!

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.389
I said, speak!

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:15.911
If this is what she does at home,
what the hell does she do outside?!

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.117
Until you decide whether you want to marry
or not, and move to your husband's house,

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.879
you will bury yourself here at home.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.158
No coming, no going.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.233
I hope your mother is mistaken.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.193
OtheMise, I have no problem
sending you to the madhouse!

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.509
Where you will rot,
until you're cured of your illness.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.874
You would explain to me why
this guy's no good or that guy's no good.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.550
And I would agree with you
and be proud of you.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:14.239
From this day fowvard,
I decide when, how and what happens!

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.159
And who you will marry!

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.352
Get out of my sight,
I can't stand to see your face!

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.909
Go to your room! Go!

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.912
I don't understand how
this could happen to us.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.071
You think I do?

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.953
If only you'd listened to me,
this wouldn't have happened!

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.951
This is the last thing I need
before the municipal elections!

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.191
Rumors that I have a lesbian daughter...

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.590
Shhh! Someone might hear you...

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.473
George, don't lock the door.
- Are you leaving?

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.239
My love.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.954
Dunya, I'm gonna move to Berlin.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.470
What?

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.432
What will you do there?

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.552
I know what I need to do tomorrow.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.237
Aside from one meeting,
I'm free all day if you want.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.395
As-salaamu alaykum.
- Wa alaykum as-salaam, come in.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.356
You're going to let these sluts
play with your head?

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.634
You really think you can gang up
with them against me?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.679
Why?

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.519
Have you lost your mind?
We're about to get married.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.271
From now on, you only talk to me,
you hear?

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.752
Leave Nour alone!
- Who do you think you are, lying whore?!

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.752
Maybe I'm a liar and a whore.
But you're a rapist.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.235
One wrong move and you'll have to
answer to those guys over there.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:08.549
Nour, don't let them make you
do things you'll regret.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.236
It's me, Wissam.
What happened is in the past.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.159
There is a solution for everything.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.074
Sweetie, you don't have to respond.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.591
No, I want to.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.029
Wissam, it's over.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.593
What do you want...
What will you tell the family?

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.195
They won't believe you,
my reputation is golden.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.708
I say, let's forget the past
and start over.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.268
And these two will be judged by God.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.952
Just so you know,
there's a video too.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.716
Is this what you want?

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.109
Nour...

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.678
Enough! You're coming with me to tell
my father that the wedding is cancelled.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.198
As-salaamu alaykum, Abu Mahmoud.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.312
Peace and God's mercy
and blessings upon you.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.433
Hello, son, how are you?
Hello my Nour.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.915
What's wrong?
What's going on?

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.871
Abu Mahmoud...

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.799
Abu Mahmoud...
Spit it out, man, what's wrong?!

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.237
It's not working out.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:00.517
Nour has changed a lot.
I don't recognize her anymore.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:12.078
Changed how?
What do you mean?

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.239
Nour, what's going on my dear?

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.630
Some things are best kept
in the heart, father.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.313
Listen,

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.950
I will beg nobody
to marry my daughter.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.193
Changed?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.671
It is you who has changed.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.038
I don't see that anything about her
has changed. Nothing!

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.953
That's enough!

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.232
Go on then!

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:45.076
A guy like that doesn't deserve
a single tear of yours.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.434
I love you.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.118
Tonight, Layla,
Almush will ﬁre up your party.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.476
I'm getting the stuff this time,
I'm not leaving it to you like last time.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.671
Look who's here, the bastard.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.754
Hey roomie!

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.875
Take a seat.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.317
You working around here?
- Yeah, in the area.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.191
How are you, Layla?
All good?

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.755
Good.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.833
What's up, Layla?
How are you?

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.792
What do you want, Ziad?

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.830
What is it my love?
What's wrong with you?

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.958
What happened?

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.111
Weren't we happy together?
What happened?

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.476
Are you here to propose
and introduce me to your parents?

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.949
Uhh...

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.598
Uhh, what?

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.788
I thought that maybe you...

01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.270
Know what, Ziad?

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.799
I'll answer for you.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.114
The answer is no.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.196
You'll never marry me, know why?

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.116
Let me tell you...

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.878
Ziad, you're just like the rest.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.833
You're living a lie.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.069
Liberal my ass.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.072
Would you let me walk with your sisters?

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.915
Answer!

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.832
Would you introduce me to your family?

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.191
No!

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.069
What exactly do you want then?

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.277
Tell me.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.956
Pathetic.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.758
I'm pathetic?

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.910
Ziad, get the fuck out of my car.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.110
Get out,
I never want to see you again.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.194
Ziad, get out of the car!

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.153
Get the fuck out!

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.154
I love you.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.275
Me too.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.513
I'll miss you.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.598
Ready for the carouse tonight?

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.758
What does carouse mean?

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.235
It means we're gonna have fun.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.713
Just say we'll have fun then.
