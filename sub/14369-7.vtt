{\an8}and NICKELODEON

00:49.799 --> 00:51.926
(<i> echoing</i> ):
Hi, guys.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.094
What's up?

00:53.178 --> 00:53.344
Dode?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.305
Mace?

00:55.388 --> 00:56.181
Guys!

00:56.264 --> 00:58.266
Wait up.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.684
Huh?

01:02.228 --> 01:03.646
{\an8}(<i> knocking on door,</i>
<i>Ginger groaning</i> )

01:03.730 --> 01:06.274
{\an8}Five more minutes.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.235
Sorry, kiddo, I already gave you
an extra half hour.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
You shouldn't have stayed up
so late.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.948
I had a hard time
falling asleep.

01:14.032 --> 01:14.783
Excited?

01:14.866 --> 01:16.034
I guess.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.580
{\an8}Well, high school orientation's
a big deal.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.291
{\an1}I remember the exact
outfit I wore for mine,

01:23.374 --> 01:25.126
{\an1}right down to the brown
suede Earth Shoes.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.505
{\an4}It's so hard
to believe you're
graduating... already.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.673
(<i> chuckles</i> )

01:30.757 --> 01:33.051
{\an1}You're going to have
a ball, mark my words.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.177
{\an8}The high school years

01:34.260 --> 01:36.554
{\an7}were some of the best
years of my life.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.973
{\an1}Also the last time
I fit into a size 12.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.435
{\an8}Not for long-- when you stroll
down that wedding aisle,

01:42.519 --> 01:44.103
{\an8}you'll be practically a waif.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.022
Ha! More like a waffle,

01:46.105 --> 01:48.191
{\an1}but I'll take
the compliment anyway.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.859
Mom, have you seen
my cufflinks?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.361
{\an8}Carl, I thought we agreed--

01:51.444 --> 01:54.405
{\an8}no more attending funerals
you weren't invited to.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.032
At ease, Lola.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.867
My formal attire is due
to the fact that I am en route

01:57.951 --> 02:00.370
to an important
business meeting,

02:00.453 --> 02:03.331
and I prefer to attend
with the confidence of knowing

02:03.414 --> 02:05.375
that my cuffs
are securely fastened.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.876
{\an8}They're in
the spice rack,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.461
{\an8}in the empty
paprika jar.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.963
Sorry for
the intrusion.

02:10.045 --> 02:13.007
{\an1}And you'd better not come home
with another floral arrangement.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.050
I mean it, Carl!

02:14.133 --> 02:15.468
You did warn your teachers

02:15.552 --> 02:17.762
that he was coming their way,
didn't you?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.097
I didn't have the heart.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.599
I'll send
a sympathy card.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.730
HOODSEY:
It's like...

02:27.814 --> 02:30.108
the mere thought of it
makes my stomach turn.

02:30.191 --> 02:34.320
I mean, if anyone ever saw
that photo, I'd be ruined.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.865
{\an1}I'm just saying you should
have thought about that

02:36.948 --> 02:39.492
{\an1}before you rode the boy
around on your handlebars.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.035
I had
amnesia, Carl!

02:41.119 --> 02:43.580
Does that mean
anything to you?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.915
{\an1}Those were darker
days, Hoodsey.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.584
(<i> brakes squeak</i> )

02:49.836 --> 02:53.381
{\an1}Fortunately,
things are looking up.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.428
Gentlemen, so glad
you could attend.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.097
Let's get to the business
at hand, Blakie boy.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.098
Very well.

03:02.181 --> 03:04.767
{\an1}As mentioned in
the engraved invitations

03:04.851 --> 03:06.686
{\an1}distributed by my staff
earlier in the week,

03:06.769 --> 03:09.272
I believe the time has come

03:09.355 --> 03:12.734
to put our silly childhood
squabbling behind us.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.611
I propose we join forces

03:14.694 --> 03:19.282
as we make our pilgrimage
next year to Lucky Junior High.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.283
There's safety
in numbers, I say,

03:20.366 --> 03:22.619
and there is no better way
to right bad blood

03:22.702 --> 03:23.953
than with good blood.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.956
{\an1}Boys, I don't clot
very well.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.333
Just so you know.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.667
He's not talking
literally, Higsby.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
Quite right.

03:32.211 --> 03:36.007
As you know, I've invited each
of you here to show good will

03:36.090 --> 03:39.719
by surrendering confiscated,
valuable and/or coveted goods.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.845
(<i> beeps</i> )

03:40.929 --> 03:41.846
(<i> whirs</i> )

03:41.930 --> 03:44.974
(<i> hissing</i> )

03:53.900 --> 03:55.485
(<i> Hoodsey groans</i> )

03:55.568 --> 03:56.986
On the count of three,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.906
{\an1}the rightful owner
shall claim his possession

03:59.989 --> 04:02.659
{\an1}as the first step
towards a united front.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.952
{\an1}One...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.829
Two, three.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.624
Mr. Licorice is going to do
the happy dance.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.626
Oh, yes, he is!

04:11.709 --> 04:13.878
Oh...

04:13.962 --> 04:17.339
How I have missed you,
my fine, fleshy friends.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.011
Good riddance to bad publicity.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.096
(<i> exclaims</i> )

04:23.179 --> 04:25.598
There you are, beautiful,

04:25.682 --> 04:28.810
apple of my eyeball,
light of my life.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.605
(<i> kisses loudly</i> )

04:34.023 --> 04:36.025
It's, like,
get a room, Carl.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.945
You know, it seems
like only yesterday

04:39.028 --> 04:40.655
that I said hello
to you all,

04:40.738 --> 04:43.032
and now it's almost
time to say good-bye.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.827
{\an4}I hope that I've enriched
your experience
as a student

04:45.910 --> 04:47.912
{\an1}as much as you've enriched
mine as a teacher.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.455
(<i> school bell rings</i> )

04:49.539 --> 04:50.623
Well, if you're ready,

04:50.707 --> 04:51.958
let's head over
to the high school

04:52.041 --> 04:54.961
and get this party started.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.214
Hey, Ginger.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.217
{\an4}As you know,
each year the staff
selects one student

05:01.300 --> 05:03.678
{\an1}from the graduating class
to give a speech.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.764
{\an5}Doesn't have to be
too long, but it
should be uplifting

05:06.848 --> 05:10.018
{\an4}to help usher your
peers towards the high
school experience.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.228
{\an1}We were wondering
if you would like to serve

05:12.311 --> 05:14.355
{\an1}as this year's speaker
at the event.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.189
Me?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.858
{\an1}Can't think
of anyone better.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.360
DODIE:
Here I stand at the threshold

05:19.444 --> 05:19.819
of high school.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.571
I can't believe it.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.572
{\an1}Ooh-whee!

05:22.655 --> 05:24.657
How do I look?

05:24.741 --> 05:28.036
Technically, this is
only orientation.

05:28.119 --> 05:28.995
Doesn't matter.

05:29.078 --> 05:29.954
We're here.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.456
I'm so excited I could sing.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.876
{\an4}I'd can the Maria
von Trapp act if
I were you, Deirdre.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.755
Upperclassmen in high school eat
girls like you for breakfast.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.259
{\an1}To think all I usually
have is a muffin.

05:43.342 --> 05:43.926
No, you have
to do it, Ging.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.636
It's a
total honor.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.721
(<i> whimpers</i> )

05:46.804 --> 05:47.847
Are you okay?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.265
{\an1}Yeah... sure...
never better.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.516
Why?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.686
{\an4}Oh, it's just that
I lost the feeling
in my left hand

05:53.770 --> 05:55.104
about four minutes ago.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.191
We have zero tolerance
for harassment of any nature.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.443
You will be expected to maintain
no less than a B average

06:00.526 --> 06:04.822
in order to participate in any
extracurricular activities.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.450
Unexplained and
excessive absenteeism

06:07.533 --> 06:09.452
will be grounds for suspension.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.369
We're also proud to announce

06:10.453 --> 06:13.623
the arrival of our
very first soda machine,

06:13.706 --> 06:16.125
which will be installed
in the cafeteria.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.794
You will need exact change.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.087
Exact change?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.297
It's all about
change, you see?

06:21.380 --> 06:24.634
{\an1}He's talking about
nickels and dimes, Ging.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.885
Keep it together.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.096
This is going to be
like when the seal girl

06:28.179 --> 06:30.556
was swept away
in the Straits of Gibraltar

06:30.640 --> 06:33.059
and consequently separated
from her herd.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.435
Yes, but she returned

06:34.519 --> 06:37.563
a richer, more well rounded,
exotic seal girl for it.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.023
With flipper piercings.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.358
Don't worry, Macie,

06:40.441 --> 06:42.652
no one's going to make you
pierce your flippers

06:42.735 --> 06:45.363
if you don't want to, and
we'll be here to back you up.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.324
I can't expect you guys
to fight my battles forever.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.993
I mean, are you going
to follow me to college

06:51.077 --> 06:53.663
and through my graduate work,
if I'm so inclined?

06:53.746 --> 06:54.997
Maybe.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.499
The important thing
to keep in mind

06:56.582 --> 06:58.751
is that nothing
is going to tear us apart.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.044
E through I,
please follow Mr. Putnam.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.256
Except maybe alphabetizing.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.925
J through O, go with
the lovely Ms. Sullivan...

07:06.008 --> 07:07.593
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

07:07.677 --> 07:09.554
(<i> clears throat</i> ):
Standing there in the back.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.642
{\an4}Oh, man, I was just
starting to feel
my fingers again.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.896
(<i> jazz playing</i> )

07:18.980 --> 07:21.023
{\an1}Isn't this
super-duper?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.484
That Bird was one cool cat.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.362
{\an5}What's with this
"people who think
they're birds" trend?

07:26.445 --> 07:30.158
First it was that freak
Polly, now this guy.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.868
{\an1}Polly's not
all bad, Hoods.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.703
{\an5}What's your impression
of the P-man,
Robert Joseph?

07:33.786 --> 07:34.704
P-man?

07:34.787 --> 07:37.039
The Bird.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.418
No offense, Mr. Hepper,
but I'm not a big fan of birds,

07:40.501 --> 07:41.878
or people who think
they're birds.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.088
That's cool.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.592
Jazz is an acquired taste,
like Clamato.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.844
It takes a mature palate

07:49.927 --> 07:52.680
to really appreciate
its complexities, dig?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.558
See, one can't really
hear the jazz

07:55.641 --> 07:58.769
until you feel the jazz,
you follow?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.771
Oh, I feel it, Mr. Hepper.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.149
I feel it way down in my bones!

08:03.232 --> 08:07.069
His sounds are as alive today
as they were 50 years ago,

08:07.153 --> 08:09.488
which brings me
to our next assignment.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.408
You cats are soon to leave
a legacy of your own,

08:12.491 --> 08:15.620
in the form of a time capsule
that will be buried

08:15.703 --> 08:18.748
here on the school grounds
of Lucky Elementary.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.041
(<i> class cheers</i> )

08:20.124 --> 08:21.626
Oh, goody, I love capsules,

08:21.709 --> 08:26.297
except when they're filled with
fever-fighting acetaminophen.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.840
Then I prefer chewables.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.883
Can we bury him
in it?

08:28.966 --> 08:29.717
Criminal offense.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.928
MR. HEPPER:
I want each of you cats

08:32.010 --> 08:34.472
to choose something
to contribute

08:34.554 --> 08:38.433
that defines the very childhoods
you're about to leave behind.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.645
GIRL:
I say why not try

08:40.727 --> 08:43.648
sending excess resources back
to the community responsible

08:43.731 --> 08:44.649
for raising them
in the first place?

08:44.732 --> 08:48.611
{\an5}I'm not sure
if you're aware,
but the Rizzo family

08:48.694 --> 08:51.280
{\an1}is struggling to pay
for Larry's kidney transplant.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
He's a sophomore.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.117
So sad about the kidney,
but if you ask me,

08:55.201 --> 08:58.287
{\an5}you might consider
relandscaping
the school grounds.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.705
Talk about
Drabsville!

08:59.789 --> 09:03.042
{\an1}Um, Courtney is a big
proponent of beautification.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.878
{\an5}It is always better
to look good than
to feel good.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.421
Tell that to Larry.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.133
{\an5}GINGER:
Uh, that is,
Courtney believes

09:11.217 --> 09:13.135
{\an1}one should work
from the outside in,

09:13.219 --> 09:15.471
{\an1}bettering aesthetics
to help better the soul.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.181
{\an1}Very progressive school
of thought, actually.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.517
{\an1}Aren't you
Ginger Foutley?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.518
GINGER:
Yeah.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.894
Weren't you
the recipient

09:21.978 --> 09:23.980
of last year's Avalanche
Arts fellowship?

09:24.063 --> 09:24.480
Yeah.

09:24.563 --> 09:25.356
Well done, Miss Foutley.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.775
I applied for that spot myself.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.818
Really?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.319
Yes.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.281
{\an5}Since aligning
with me, Ginger has
really gone places.

09:33.364 --> 09:37.451
{\an5}Hard to believe she
was just that wilting
little wallflower

09:37.535 --> 09:38.494
not long ago.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.288
Weren't you also
the one who came up

09:40.371 --> 09:41.372
with the Student
Reformation program?

09:41.455 --> 09:43.958
Not one of my
best ideas, but...

09:44.041 --> 09:45.793
{\an1}Well, kids,
we have to keep moving.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.919
Have a lot left to see.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.130
And let me know about
that landscaping.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.048
{\an1}The workers who did Mama's
self-reflection garden

09:51.132 --> 09:52.967
are very reasonable.

09:53.050 --> 09:53.718
{\an5}Well, Ginger,

09:53.801 --> 09:56.137
this fall,
run for student council,

09:56.220 --> 09:57.680
because you are a shoo-in.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.181
I mean, I'll support you.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.683
Wow, thanks.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.977
{\an1}Oh, and bamboo needs
a lot of water,

10:03.060 --> 10:06.188
so you might want to consider
a sprinkler system

10:06.272 --> 10:07.940
and a bed of river rocks.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.401
(<i> playing band music</i> )

10:10.484 --> 10:12.069
{\an1}They're really
selling it.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.031
{\an5}Lightfoot, you're
getting checked out
like a library book.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.033
Say again?

10:19.243 --> 10:19.869
You're right.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.038
His one good eye
is all over me.

10:22.121 --> 10:22.788
(<i> inhales</i> )

10:22.872 --> 10:24.415
{\an1}Hi, kids, I'm Mr. Meyer,
the director

10:24.498 --> 10:27.293
{\an1}of the marching
and symphonic bands.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.546
{\an4}As you can see, we're
short on clarinets
but not on talent.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.631
{\an1}Do we have any
clarinets out there?

10:32.715 --> 10:33.758
Oh, oh!

10:33.841 --> 10:34.717
{\an1}Fantastic!

10:34.800 --> 10:35.384
That's terrific.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.887
{\an1}I hope to see you
next year.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.222
{\an5}The Lucky Goat band
is probably the most
glamorous elective

10:40.306 --> 10:41.557
{\an1}offered at
the high school,

10:41.640 --> 10:44.727
what with the football games,
the bus trips,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.605
the national competitions
and the visitation rights

10:47.688 --> 10:48.898
with Chewy,
our goat mascot.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.232
{\an1}(<i> bleats</i> )

10:50.316 --> 10:51.567
Being in band is, well, a...

10:51.650 --> 10:53.361
(<i> imitating goat</i> ):
"bla-a-a-a-st."

10:53.444 --> 10:54.945
Ain't that right, kids?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.906
(<i> kids bleating</i> )

10:56.989 --> 10:58.824
(<i> bleating</i> )

10:58.908 --> 11:00.201
(<i> young man bleats</i> )

11:00.284 --> 11:04.413
QUARTERBACK:
26, 32, 47, hike!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.664
(<i> grunting</i> )

11:07.917 --> 11:11.587
That, boys, is real phlegm,
blood and human saliva

11:11.670 --> 11:13.214
you're being sprayed with.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.091
{\an1}Team practice begins
around mid-August,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.593
a couple of weeks before
the start of school year,

11:17.676 --> 11:19.762
{\an1}and we go right through
Thanksgiving Day.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.015
Now, we're looking for,
number one, commitment;

11:23.099 --> 11:24.475
number two, dedication;

11:24.558 --> 11:28.104
and C, a willingness to undergo
compound body fractures.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.525
Well, is that there a Patterson
I see before my twinkling eyes?

11:32.608 --> 11:35.194
Yes, sir, Darren
Patterson... sir.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.947
Well, look at who
we have here, boys.

11:38.030 --> 11:38.989
It's a Patterson.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.116
Ooh-whee!

11:40.199 --> 11:42.535
PLAYERS (<i> chanting</i> ):
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.744
{\an5}Now, for those of you
who don't know,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.747
Patterson's daddy was
the best darn coach

11:46.831 --> 11:49.250
this high school ever did see,
personal company included.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.710
And his older
brother, Will,

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
is the best high school
quarterback of all time.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.923
I guess I know

11:56.006 --> 11:59.218
where this Patterson
will be come mid-August.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.138
{\an5}Actually I'm
not much of a
football fan.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.722
I'm more of a kinder,
gentler Patterson

12:03.806 --> 12:07.143
who enjoys walks in the park
and intact collarbones.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.104
(<i> laughing</i> )

12:10.187 --> 12:12.148
{\an1}That's a good one,
son.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.941
SQUAD:
One, two,

12:14.024 --> 12:15.484
we'll break it down for you!

12:15.568 --> 12:16.318
We'll sack your quarterback

12:16.402 --> 12:19.155
all the way to Hackensack!

12:19.238 --> 12:20.489
Take a note-- we don't gloat!

12:20.573 --> 12:21.699
Just beat you bad!

12:21.782 --> 12:22.575
We're Goats!

12:22.658 --> 12:23.659
Go, Goats! Go, Goats!

12:23.742 --> 12:25.703
Go, Goats! Go, Goats! Go, Goats!

12:25.786 --> 12:27.997
Go... Goats!

12:28.080 --> 12:29.123
(<i> bleating</i> )

12:29.206 --> 12:31.000
I want in.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.835
Don't they all?

12:32.918 --> 12:34.587
First you have
to audition

12:34.670 --> 12:37.047
in front of the rest
of the squad.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.508
Typically you're asked
to perform

12:39.592 --> 12:41.677
the classic
Lucky routines--

12:41.760 --> 12:44.305
{\an1}maybe a few flips, a split,
a (<i> bleats</i> ) or two.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.807
But I've got
to warn you--

12:46.891 --> 12:48.100
no freshman has ever
made the cut.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.019
{\an1}Ever?

12:50.102 --> 12:50.561
{\an3}Ever!

12:50.644 --> 12:52.646
But don't be
discouraged.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.024
Just because it
has never happened,

12:55.107 --> 12:57.359
ever, never, not ever,
never, never...!

12:57.443 --> 12:58.152
SQUAD:
Go, Goats!

12:58.235 --> 13:02.781
Go... Goats!

13:03.491 --> 13:04.617
You mark my words, Mama,

13:04.700 --> 13:06.744
I shall blaze a trail
here at Lucky High

13:06.827 --> 13:09.788
and truly make a name
for us Griplings.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.623
This is
a no-phone zone.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.751
{\an1}Let me ring you
right back, Mama.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.045
{\an5}(<i> mockingly</i> ):
"Let me ring you
right back, Mama."

13:16.128 --> 13:17.213
{\an1}How rude!

13:17.296 --> 13:18.005
News flash:

13:18.088 --> 13:20.591
No one likes snotty
little freshmen

13:20.674 --> 13:22.009
with expensive toys.

13:22.092 --> 13:26.263
Look here, I wouldn't even
talk to my dog that way...

13:26.347 --> 13:28.474
if I had a dog, which I don't.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.976
You want to make
something of it?

13:34.146 --> 13:35.814
(<i> locker door clanks shut</i> )

13:44.490 --> 13:48.244
Wow... that was, like, ages ago.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.578
Wasn't it great?!

13:49.662 --> 13:50.746
Wasn't it superb?!

13:50.829 --> 13:54.166
{\an1}Wasn't it everything you
ever dreamed it would be?!

13:54.250 --> 13:55.626
Hey, guys.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.461
Talk about your walk
down Memory Lane.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.422
We weren't talking
about Memory Lane.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.758
{\an1}We were talking
about high school,

14:02.841 --> 14:05.219
{\an1}home to full-size lockers,
a full-service cafeteria

14:05.302 --> 14:07.471
and full...

14:07.555 --> 14:09.848
Don't hate me,
but I've chosen my electives,

14:09.932 --> 14:10.516
and I'm signing up for band.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.435
{\an1}There's just
something about it

14:13.519 --> 14:15.437
{\an1}that makes me feel
like I've found my people.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.856
F.Y.I.-- Courtney
went AWOL

14:17.940 --> 14:19.316
and appears
to be M.I.A.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.193
She was in your
group, Foutley.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.861
What gives?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.154
I don't know.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.116
I haven't seen her since
we toured the student lounge.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.785
{\an5}Great, she
probably scoped
some hallway hotties

14:29.868 --> 14:31.662
{\an5}and scored
mad digits
without me.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.289
I knew I should've
tailed her.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.292
(<i> crying</i> )

14:36.375 --> 14:37.543
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

14:37.626 --> 14:39.920
Being discovered
would damage my rep.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.590
Not being discovered
would damage my rep.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.093
Any way you slice it,
my rep is going to be damaged.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.970
What to do?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.763
If only I could reach
that phone.

14:49.847 --> 14:55.644
(<i> players chanting,</i>
<i>phone ringing</i> )

14:55.728 --> 15:00.482
Her last words were "Mama,
I will call you right back."

15:00.566 --> 15:01.191
But she never did!

15:01.275 --> 15:03.527
(<i> sobbing</i> )

15:03.611 --> 15:05.613
What was she wearing?

15:05.696 --> 15:09.033
{\an4}(<i> calmly</i> ):
An adorable little
cashmere twin set

15:09.116 --> 15:11.952
{\an1}that I picked up
in the south of France,

15:12.036 --> 15:14.204
{\an1}the palest shade of lilac
with green piping. Mmm!

15:14.288 --> 15:16.332
(<i> sobbing</i> )

15:16.415 --> 15:19.418
Oh, you must find her!

15:19.501 --> 15:20.544
Did you hear?

15:20.628 --> 15:21.712
{\an1}Just now.

15:21.795 --> 15:22.546
Word is an
antifreshman league

15:22.630 --> 15:25.090
has claimed
responsibility

15:25.174 --> 15:25.591
for the disappearance.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.676
Good maple of York!

15:27.760 --> 15:30.346
{\an1}We're not even
officially freshmen!

15:30.429 --> 15:34.725
Uh... uh...
forgot my reeds.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.519
Did he just offer me

15:37.603 --> 15:40.022
an unsolicited explanation
of his whereabouts?

15:40.105 --> 15:40.981
He did.

15:41.065 --> 15:41.315
He certainly did.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.692
Who is he?

15:43.776 --> 15:44.735
Bass clarinet.

15:44.818 --> 15:45.903
Yowsuh!

15:45.986 --> 15:48.656
So that's why you wanted
to take band so badly.

15:48.739 --> 15:52.201
He wanted you to know
where he was.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.996
{\an1}In the boy universe, that's
got to mean something.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.248
{\an5}(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Oh, yeah.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.209
(<i> muffled ring</i> )

16:00.292 --> 16:02.878
(<i> Courtney sighing</i> )

16:02.961 --> 16:05.381
I'm bordering
on total dehydration

16:05.464 --> 16:07.299
and remain desperately in need

16:07.383 --> 16:10.386
of a light, fragrance-free
facial moisturizer

16:10.469 --> 16:14.556
that will replenish without
causing any secondary breakouts.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.058
(<i> locker door opens outside</i> )

16:17.393 --> 16:18.435
Oh, hello!

16:18.519 --> 16:19.478
Hello,
out there!

16:19.561 --> 16:21.271
(<i> rattling</i> )

16:21.355 --> 16:23.065
{\an3}Boy?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.733
(<i> rattling</i> )

16:24.817 --> 16:27.695
My name is Courtney Gripling,

16:27.778 --> 16:30.114
and I'm in need
of your services.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.253
I will improve
your social standing

16:44.336 --> 16:45.087
and success rate with girls

16:45.170 --> 16:46.797
if you will forget
what you just saw

16:46.880 --> 16:49.550
and never speak of this
to anyone.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.426
Whoa, sure thing.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.970
(<i> door bangs shut</i> )

16:53.345 --> 16:54.680
I'm sorry!

16:54.763 --> 16:57.266
I should've been more clear.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.144
I meant <i> after</i> you rescued me
from the locker.

17:00.227 --> 17:04.021
I <i> will</i> need you to rescue me
from this locker!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.107
Boy?

17:11.238 --> 17:14.950
{\an5}HOODSEY:
Does Noelle know you're
seeing Polly again?

17:15.032 --> 17:17.243
CARL:
I think I mentioned it.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.121
I must have.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.122
{\an1}Didn't I?

17:20.204 --> 17:21.290
I'm sure I did.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.292
{\an1}In fact she probably
would've been here herself

17:24.376 --> 17:26.252
{\an1}if she didn't have
to be fitted

17:26.336 --> 17:28.088
{\an1}for her orthopedic
dance shoes.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.215
{\an1}She's taking
flamenco lessons.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.138
You're late, Carl!

17:36.221 --> 17:37.306
(<i> squawks</i> )

17:37.389 --> 17:38.390
Please forgive
our tardiness.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.269
{\an4}Hoodsey and I
are facing a bit
of a personal dilemma.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.814
Hmm, you're shaped
like a budgie.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.400
I have a slow
metabolism.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.735
{\an1}She didn't mean it
as an insult, Hoods.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.404
{\an1}She thinks you look
like a bird.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.906
Yeah, great.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.699
I'm telling
you, Carl,

17:55.783 --> 17:59.244
{\an1}there's something really wrong
with that girl.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.872
I think she's kind
of fascinating.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.749
Nut cases tend to be.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.794
{\an1}So, let me pick your brain
about something, Polly.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.753
{\an3}Shoot.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.172
{\an1}Our class is creating
a time capsule,

18:10.255 --> 18:12.466
and Hoodsey and I have
to surrender something

18:12.549 --> 18:14.134
{\an1}that defines our childhood
for it.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.011
So? Clean out
the nest.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.679
Give that up.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.680
But we just got that back.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.474
Sounds like
a budgie, too.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.768
(<i> squawks</i> )

18:22.851 --> 18:24.019
You notice?

18:24.102 --> 18:25.187
(<i> squawks</i> )

18:25.270 --> 18:26.980
I do not!

18:27.064 --> 18:28.690
{\an1}It's just that
we spent our youth

18:28.774 --> 18:31.193
{\an1}serving and
protecting Feldman.

18:31.276 --> 18:36.323
We even had to give Gripling
back his tonsils for it.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.868
(<i> squawking</i> )

18:41.036 --> 18:42.538
POLLY:
Precisely.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.415
Whenever you place that much
importance on something,

18:45.499 --> 18:46.875
you allow it to control you.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.835
Putt.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.127
It doesn't control me.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.963
I just don't want to give it up.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.965
{\an1}It stems from a fear
of letting go.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.425
If you want your life
to be ruled by fear,

18:55.509 --> 18:56.051
that's up to you.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.220
{\an1}Blue goes first,
budgie boy.

18:58.303 --> 18:58.846
(<i> squawks</i> )

18:58.929 --> 19:02.808
This summer,
evil has a name,

19:02.891 --> 19:05.435
and it's
Polly Shuster.

19:05.519 --> 19:11.567
She is not to be trusted, Carl,
and apparently neither are you.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.235
<i>Ay!</i>

19:13.318 --> 19:14.611
COURTNEY:
It was midday.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.072
I was peckish.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.991
I wandered into
the cafeteria

19:19.074 --> 19:21.869
in search of a tiny espresso
and a piece of biscotti,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.746
preferably the imported variety
featuring almonds.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.291
Within moments,
a wrong turn sent me

19:27.374 --> 19:28.625
into a cold, damp
storage room.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.753
The door locked behind me.

19:31.837 --> 19:36.300
I was nearly out of oxygen
when Unnamed Boy found me.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.926
Unnamed Boy is a hero.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.095
(<i> gasps</i> ):
A hero.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.847
That's my story,

19:41.930 --> 19:44.391
and I'm sticking
to it.

19:44.474 --> 19:48.145
Unnamed Boy,
are you really unnamed?

19:48.228 --> 19:49.313
No, I'm Andrew.

19:49.396 --> 19:53.942
I've already got your name
inked on that jersey, Patterson.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.611
I'll see you at practice.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.029
Fall out!

19:57.112 --> 19:59.573
Football? You're
joining football?

19:59.656 --> 20:00.449
Not willfully.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.826
It seems as though
it's a prerequisite

20:02.910 --> 20:04.786
for being a male Patterson.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.664
{\an1}But the football schedule
is really intense.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.333
We'll never see
each other.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.084
I just agreed to one practice.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.294
That's all for now...

20:12.377 --> 20:15.088
although I got to admit
it's kind of flattering

20:15.172 --> 20:17.716
{\an1}to get all this attention
from the coach.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.635
Well, if it's
attention you want.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.637
{\an5}Any ideas for that
speech, Ginger?

20:21.720 --> 20:22.804
Truth?

20:22.888 --> 20:23.931
Not a one.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.350
I don't mean to pressure you,
but if you want feedback,

20:26.433 --> 20:30.479
you'll need to get a draft to me
sooner rather than later.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.855
I am swamped
with planning.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.482
Okay, I'll get to it soon.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.983
Darren and I just have to...

20:35.067 --> 20:36.818
{\an1}No, Ging,
this is more important.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.236
{\an1}You go work
on your speech

20:38.320 --> 20:41.615
{\an4}and call me later
after you've made
some progress, okay?

20:41.698 --> 20:45.369
But, uh...
yeah, okay.

20:45.452 --> 20:45.786
Good-bye, Darren.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.995
No, no, no, no.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.998
{\an1}This isn't
"Good-bye, Darren."

20:50.082 --> 20:50.999
{\an1}This is just
"Call me later

20:51.083 --> 20:54.920
{\an1}after you've made
some progress, Darren."

20:55.003 --> 20:56.129
{\an1}Okay?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.714
Okay... if you say so.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.967
You made a delicious fish fry,

21:00.050 --> 21:03.011
and you shouldn't be
penalized for that,

21:03.095 --> 21:06.014
but it's either you
or my new pantsuit, my friend.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.934
So this is good-bye.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.853
{\an1}So, was orientation everything
you thought it would be?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.397
(<i> dully</i> ):
Uh, yeah.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.524
{\an1}Did you finish
choosing your classes?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.067
(<i> dully</i> ):
Yeah.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.276
Pretty exciting, huh?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.195
(<i> dully</i> ):
Yeah.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.614
{\an1}(<i> sighs</i> )

21:22.698 --> 21:25.659
{\an4}This is a dietetic
fat-free vanilla sandwich
cookie moment, isn't it?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.744
What gives?

21:27.828 --> 21:28.829
I don't know, Ma.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.038
I feel like I'm
being rushed--

21:30.122 --> 21:34.001
rushed into picking
my freshman classes,

21:34.084 --> 21:37.254
rushed into writing
this graduation speech,

21:37.337 --> 21:38.046
rushed into adulthood.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.842
I know it sounds stupid,
but it's true.

21:41.925 --> 21:45.679
It does not sound stupid, kiddo,
not stupid at all.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.849
But consider this:
Growing up is like dieting.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.226
{\an1}There comes a point
when your old clothes

21:51.309 --> 21:52.894
{\an1}just don't fit
you anymore,

21:52.978 --> 21:55.897
{\an1}but the idea of giving up
that old argyle sweater

21:55.981 --> 21:58.233
with the elbows
worn out just so

21:58.317 --> 21:59.609
makes you want to cry.

21:59.693 --> 22:03.572
{\an1}Until the day when you catch
your new and improved reflection

22:03.655 --> 22:07.576
{\an1}in that formfitting number,
and you think, "Hey, not bad"--

22:07.659 --> 22:09.745
suddenly it's not so hard

22:09.828 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}to leave behind
old Uncle Argyle, see?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.250
Mom, Dr. Dave is great.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.711
I'm really happy for you.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.171
Great, he is.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.923
So it took me two tries
before I got the doctor?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.633
(<i> giggles</i> )

22:23.717 --> 22:26.428
{\an1}Yeah, there's a lot of change
going on around here,

22:26.511 --> 22:27.429
that's for sure.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.180
{\an1}But, Ging,
I want you to know

22:28.263 --> 22:30.766
{\an1}that I'll always be
right here...

22:30.849 --> 22:33.769
with the dietetic fat-free
vanilla sandwich cookie jar

22:33.852 --> 22:34.644
{\an1}on hand.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.897
Good.
