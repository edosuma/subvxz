01:27.720 --> 01:29.631
Hi, honey. How was work?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.039
I didn't quite make it to work
this morning, Peg.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.198
You may not have noticed,
since you were too busy sleeping.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.710
The city towed my car away again
this morning.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.798
They keep thinking
it's an abandoned car.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.879
- Why, Peg?
- It's a Dodge, Al.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.913
Any time you see a Dodge,
you think it's abandoned.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.518
Hey, by the way, where's your neck?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.551
Well, that's an amusing
little side story, Peg.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.077
You see, when I got to
the impound lot...

02:04.280 --> 02:06.635
...I saw my car was in line for
the wrecking ball.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.912
So I ran over and jumped in,
tried to stop it.

02:12.440 --> 02:16.877
But I was too late.
But I did get a free sunroof.

02:18.120 --> 02:23.114
Both for my car and my head.
Straighten me out, for God's sake, Peg.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.309
Thanks, Peg. You got any aspirin?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.635
Oh, just two.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.197
You know, your stories always
give me such a headache.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.748
Hey, Dad, can I borrow your car?
I gotta go through a rough part of town.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.554
I found if I turn my hat backwards
and drive your car...

02:55.760 --> 02:58.513
...even the gangs cut me a wide path.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.355
Dodge says something
very special about you.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.876
Oh, yeah. It says,
" Damn right I failed. "

03:10.880 --> 03:14.190
- Are you okay, Mrs. D'Arcy?
- Well, I was...

03:14.400 --> 03:16.470
...till I was swept up by
this huge machine...

03:16.680 --> 03:19.558
...which now knows me
as few men have.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.074
- Do you mind backing it up a bit?
- Sure, mister.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.316
Marcy, I saw what happened.
I ran right over.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.351
Nice bike.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.512
- Aren't you gonna ask me how I am?
- I asked you this morning.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.554
How many times a day do I have to
ask you how you feel? I care, okay?

03:45.240 --> 03:47.435
Young man, do you have insurance?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.833
- Of course not.
- Insurance?

03:51.440 --> 03:55.274
Oh, I suppose having insurance
isn't cool anymore?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.397
Come on, Jefferson.

03:58.880 --> 04:04.477
I drove a moped in college,
so I understand the outlaw mentality.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.879
But the next time you run over my wife,
you better have insurance, pally.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.432
Nice bike.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.473
Punk.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.279
So did you have a good time today?

04:21.480 --> 04:24.597
Yeah, I always have fun
watching sausages being made.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.712
You know, I never knew
how many fingers went into them.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.713
Listen, I wanted to take you
out tomorrow...

04:31.920 --> 04:34.480
...because it's your birthday and all.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.831
And they say that jail
hardens a man.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.354
Oh, hi, Daddy.
Do you remember Frank?

04:43.560 --> 04:45.755
I barely remember Bud.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.113
- Your boss called. You're late for work.
- Whoops, I gotta run.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.029
- Daddy, give Frank a kiss for me, okay?
- Of course, pumpkin.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.431
Relax, Frank. I don't kiss anyone
who doesn't cook for me. Ask the wife.

05:00.680 --> 05:04.389
Sir, I hope you don't mind I'm taking
your daughter out for her birthday.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.068
No kidding? It's her birthday?

05:07.280 --> 05:12.035
Well, what is she, 12, 30?
Who really cares.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.352
Just take her someplace special.
Wait a minute.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.951
There. Now beat it.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.269
Al, that attractive young thug
has shamed us.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.270
- We forgot Kelly's birthday again.
- So? Bundys don't celebrate birthdays.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.358
Oh, sure it causes irreparable,
emotional scars...

05:37.560 --> 05:39.710
...but saves a few bucks
in presents.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.919
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Luscious hooters?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.832
No, I wasn't thinking that.
I should've been, but...

05:55.240 --> 05:57.276
I was thinking about
your sister's birthday.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.994
And we're missing
a grand opportunity here.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.760
I say we should ask
to take Kelly out.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.238
She'll say she has plans
and she'll actually think we care.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.512
And then we can just forget
Kelly's birthday forever.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.711
<i>Because if she complains, we'll say:</i>

06:13.920 --> 06:15.672
"Well, we offered to take you out...

06:15.880 --> 06:19.953
...but you broke our hearts
when you turned us down. "

06:21.480 --> 06:23.436
Bud, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:24.080 --> 06:27.834
- Kelly's a sucker?
- No. I was thinking of luscious hooters.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.192
I'd moved on.
Kelly, come down here. Hurry up.

06:40.720 --> 06:45.111
Smile all you want.
I am not pulling any of your fingers.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.313
Well, I guess one surprise
will have to do, then.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.791
Sweetheart, tomorrow
is a very important day.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.630
- It's my little girl's birthday.
- Congratulations, Bud.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.873
I'm just kidding. I mean,
who would care about his birthday?

07:04.080 --> 07:07.277
- I can't believe you remembered mine.
- Not only did we remember it...

07:07.480 --> 07:11.234
...but we want to celebrate it by taking
you to the movies. With the family.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.638
Well, I have a date with Frank
and I really like him a lot.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.559
Oh, she's busy.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.795
It's all right, honey. We understand.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.151
But I am going to cancel my date
and go to the movies with you.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.079
I mean, you guys
are like a family to me.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.753
Happy now, bonehead?

07:40.960 --> 07:44.396
Now this one's gonna want something
for his birthday too.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.111
Well, forget about it.
We don't even wanna know when it is.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.799
Fortunately, he has no friends
to tell us.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.434
He has no friends.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.592
Eighteen movies in this Cineplex...

08:04.800 --> 08:08.270
<i>...and the only one not sold out is
Coffee Cups For Two.</i>

08:08.760 --> 08:10.990
I guess that must mean
it's gonna be real good.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.795
- Oh, lordy.
- Hey, wait a minute, Peg.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.833
- Wait. We can't afford that.
- Americans coming through.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.600
- Bonbon.
- Peg, we're on a limited budget here.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.755
Bonbon.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.916
It's more expensive here
than anywhere else.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.510
- Bonbon.
- Bonbon.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.472
And I would like a-

08:38.080 --> 08:41.914
And a large Diet Coke.
Yes, thank you very much.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.589
That'll be $100.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.869
But we don't need this dog here.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.794
How dare you
try to sell us empty boxes?

09:21.600 --> 09:23.556
I brought this from home.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.079
Let's go.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.072
You didn't see nothing, kid.
You understand me? Nothing.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.073
Thank you, family. This is
the bestest birthday I ever had.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.238
I can't believe he's here.
I am so upset.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.630
Well, honey, it's kind of a family thing.
We couldn't leave Daddy home.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.917
No, Mom. Look, it's Frank.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.113
God, just because I broke our date,
he's out with another girl.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.756
And he has that talking-about-
his-uncle's-sausage look on his face.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.598
Oh, now, don't worry, honey.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.598
You're gonna have a great time.
You're with your family.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.959
Well, Dad, enough of this bonding.
I got a captive audience here.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.594
I'm gonna go bother me some girls.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.590
Hello.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.679
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm your new boyfriend.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.040
Well, I'm your new ex-girlfriend.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.553
Call me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.639
<i>Reginald Bundy, critic for the Times.</i>

11:42.840 --> 11:45.673
You know, I get so few chances
to see films with the public.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.713
This time I wanna watch a film
exactly as the people do.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.309
So, if you don't mind...

12:11.040 --> 12:14.669
Oh, I see you're alone.
Well, don't worry...

12:14.880 --> 12:18.634
...because me and my beard
make just an excellent friend.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.750
Here's the popcorn you wanted, Lil.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.438
You know, some boy was
bothering me before.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.074
I wonder where he is now.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.069
Well, let me know if you see him.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.511
Damn. I'm sitting on
something lumpy.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.351
Probably a Milk Dud.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.592
You people have to
keep your feet down.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.268
- Go chase yourself, peasant.
- Go on.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.670
Thank you for your cooperation.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.357
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

13:24.560 --> 13:28.553
<i>...our theatres are participating in a
Send a Kid to the Movies program.</i>

13:28.760 --> 13:32.639
<i>An usher will be collecting at the end
of this feature. Thank you.</i>

13:35.160 --> 13:39.995
- Hey, the movie's starting. Shut up.
- Save my seat, Peg.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.791
Gave me his popcorn.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.874
<i>And now our feature presentation.</i>

14:05.680 --> 14:08.353
Mom, did this ever happen to you
when you dated?

14:08.800 --> 14:12.110
Yes. Once. I was out with your dad...

14:12.320 --> 14:16.108
...and we saw this really cool boy
that I was dating out with another girl.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.799
So I had your Daddy beat him up.

14:18.920 --> 14:23.914
You know, that's what I love about your
dad. He's like a big, stupid guard dog.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.040
He didn't even ask why
he was beating the guy up.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.959
He just loved it so.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.312
Honey, men are to be ignored.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.717
Just pretend you're married to this guy.
You won't care what he does.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.030
Well, it's not so easy.
I mean, I wear my heart on my sleaze.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.238
Daddy, what makes men
cheat on women?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.919
Women.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.193
Pumpkin, don't take it personally.
See...

14:57.400 --> 15:01.359
...men are different. We're loners,
rogues, great white hunters...

15:01.560 --> 15:05.792
...roaming wild and free,
like our ancestors, the mighty monkey.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.188
We need variety.
In fact, women like us that way.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.992
They want us to be that way.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.350
Women don't respect men
unless they cheat.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.989
That's why your mother
doesn't respect me.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.159
But, honey, if it'll make you feel
any better- Booby. I saw a booby.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.910
Al, that is a forehead with a zit on it.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.273
Put on your glasses.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.833
This is too much.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.917
I'm gonna get more popcorn
and complain...

15:36.120 --> 15:38.190
...to the manager there's
not enough hooters...

15:38.400 --> 15:40.391
...in this otherwise
undistinguished film.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.749
God, I've never been
cheated on before.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.393
Mom, am I losing it?

15:46.600 --> 15:51.549
Oh, no, honey. You don't lose it
till you're like 50 or 60.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.034
I mean, look at me.

15:53.240 --> 15:58.758
I am getting sexier and, yes,
classier, every year.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.632
I can't be losing it.
I gotta see something.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.159
Excuse me.
Would you leave her for me?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.437
You bet.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.994
Thanks.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.874
Well, that helped a little bit.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.919
I hate men.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.999
So does God.
That's why he made them want us.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.079
Not to change the subject from men,
but where's your father?

16:52.400 --> 16:56.359
Peg? Kids?
Where the hell are you?

17:02.080 --> 17:05.834
Well, I complained to the manager
about the lack of hooters in this film.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.957
You know, Peg, you're looking good
in this dim light.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.479
Remember what we used to do
at the movies?

17:17.160 --> 17:21.631
You're not Peg!
Peg! Peg, help me!

17:21.839 --> 17:23.796
- Al?
- Peg?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.388
- Al!
- Peg!

17:26.599 --> 17:31.037
- Al, you're in the wrong theatre again!
- What?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.274
Damn multiplexes.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.310
Oh, my gosh. I think I see a booby.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.517
Peg, wait. I'll be over in a minute.
I think I'm seeing hooters here!

17:44.880 --> 17:46.836
I am seeing hooters here.

18:03.960 --> 18:08.795
That was a beautiful, lovely movie.
I saw 22 hooters.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.197
A bunch of guys were killed.
Had no story at all.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.952
It had- It had everything.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.271
Oh, my God. It's Mr. D'Arcy.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.596
What, is everybody
cheating on everybody?

18:41.800 --> 18:45.873
You know, I have got half a mind
to give him half a half of my mind.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.714
You. Neighbour boy.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.556
How dare you cheat on
your miserable, flat-chested...

18:55.760 --> 18:59.435
...aged, skinny little wife
with this obvious slattern.

18:59.640 --> 19:04.430
I mean, look at her.
That hair. That slutty dress.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.754
Well, the dress is okay.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.470
Go away, you idiot.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.518
Oh, I see. You guys are role-playing.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.269
Hey, Mom, Dad. The D'Arcys are
role-playing to get themselves hot.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.949
<i>How am I supposed to score
sitting with my parents?</i>

19:36.560 --> 19:40.235
<i>I'm a cool guy and nobody knows it
because I'm with my parents.</i>

19:40.440 --> 19:42.431
<i>Next time I'm gonna sit alone.</i>

19:42.640 --> 19:47.077
<i>Yeah. Babes can't resist a guy
who sits alone at the movies.</i>

19:48.120 --> 19:50.680
<i>Maybe I'll wear a raincoat.</i>

19:57.520 --> 20:00.318
<i>How long is this thing?</i>

20:01.240 --> 20:04.516
<i>She loves him. He loves her.</i>

20:04.720 --> 20:06.517
<i>I can't tak e it.</i>

20:06.920 --> 20:10.196
<i>I'm gonna run amuck
and start dismembering everyone.</i>

20:14.480 --> 20:17.278
<i>And I'm gonna start with her.</i>

20:21.080 --> 20:24.914
<i>Gee, this film has really touched Al.</i>

20:26.040 --> 20:29.476
<i>I see a tear in his eye.</i>

20:30.000 --> 20:33.629
<i>I think I actually may
get some tonight.</i>

20:33.840 --> 20:38.675
<i>Thank you, Cosmo.
You really do know men.</i>

20:40.720 --> 20:43.473
<i>I lik e the way my hair tastes tonight.</i>

20:48.840 --> 20:52.753
I can't take this anymore.
It's like Chinese waiter torture.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.358
I have to talk.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.112
- Hello, Frank.
- Kelly.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.796
It's not what you think. You see,
I was planning on using her dentist...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.116
...and I was just
checking out his work.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.309
Well, I might have bought that if I didn't
know that you see an excellent dentist.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.875
But, you know, it's okay.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.789
I mean, at first I was hurt to see you
with someone else, but after all...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.230
...I cancelled the date.
It's my birthday...

21:31.440 --> 21:34.079
...and it is time
to handle my life maturely.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.636
I want you to know that I understand
what happened and it's okay.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.637
- Daddy, beat him up.
- Of course, pumpkin.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.919
And that's why cable will never replace
the moviegoing experience.
