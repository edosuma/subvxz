06:26.667 --> 06:27.867
>> ARE YOU HERE TO ARGUE?

06:27.867 --> 06:28.967
>> NOT ABOUT THAT.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.667
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO VICTOR?

06:30.667 --> 06:31.833
>> YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

06:31.833 --> 06:33.200
AT MY PARTY.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.367
I'M OFFENDED THAT YOU KEEP

06:34.367 --> 06:35.467
PUSHING FOR ME TO GET BACK

06:35.467 --> 06:36.133
WITH HIM.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.367
>> RAQUEL, HOW MANY OTHER MEN DO

06:37.367 --> 06:39.433
YOU KNOW WITH VICTOR'S PEDIGREE?

06:39.433 --> 06:41.067
DESPITE A FLAW OR TWO,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.900
HE'S A GREAT CATCH.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.333
PLUS, BOTH FAMILIES HAVE

06:44.333 --> 06:45.767
INVESTED YEARS IN THIS

06:45.767 --> 06:46.733
RELATIONSHIP.

06:46.733 --> 06:47.833
>> THAT'S ON YOU GUYS.

06:47.833 --> 06:48.800
NOT ME.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.867
>> SWEETHEART, IT IS MY

06:49.867 --> 06:51.167
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE YOU

06:51.167 --> 06:52.467
MARRY WELL, LIKE MY MOTHER DID

06:52.467 --> 06:53.333
FOR ME.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.233
I CAN'T BE SETTLED UNTIL YOU'RE

06:55.233 --> 06:56.467
SETTLED IN A MARRIAGE.

06:56.467 --> 06:57.800
>> MOTHER, I APPRECIATE YOUR

06:57.800 --> 06:59.067
GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT YOU'RE

06:59.067 --> 07:00.900
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.233
NOW, IF YOU CAN EXCUSE ME,

07:02.233 --> 07:03.500
I PROMISED I'D HELP OUT AROUND

07:03.500 --> 07:05.100
HERE.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.767
>> YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD BE EASIER

07:06.767 --> 07:09.100
TO EXPLAIN IF YOU WERE IN REHAB.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.100
>> [scoffs]

07:17.100 --> 07:17.967
>> DR. GRIMES WANTED ME

07:17.967 --> 07:19.133
TO APOLOGIZE.

07:19.133 --> 07:19.800
SHE HAD TO LEAVE

07:19.800 --> 07:21.067
FOR AN EMERGENCY SURGERY.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.267
YOU CAN EITHER RESCHEDULE

07:22.267 --> 07:24.267
OR HAVE DR. RINGLER GIVE YOU

07:24.267 --> 07:25.533
YOUR PAP SMEAR TODAY.

07:25.533 --> 07:26.600
>> OH, NO, THAT'S FINE.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.333
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO COME

07:27.333 --> 07:28.100
ALL THE WAY BACK.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.500
>> OKAY, I'LL SEND HIM RIGHT IN.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.533
>> THANK YOU.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.067
[sighs]

07:34.067 --> 07:35.633
DON'T TEASE ME, BRAD.

07:35.633 --> 07:37.067
I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU AND JEN,

07:37.067 --> 07:39.067
BUT THIS TIME, IT'S EVERY WOMAN

07:39.067 --> 07:42.067
FOR HERSELF.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.600
HMM.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.633
>> SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.767
>> MORNING.

07:47.767 --> 07:48.767
NO WORRIES.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.767
>> OKAY, I'M GOING GET YOU TO

07:50.767 --> 07:51.433
SCOOT DOWN AT THE EDGE OF

07:51.433 --> 07:54.700
THE TABLE.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.067
THAT'S IT.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.067
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS IS GOING TO

07:58.067 --> 08:00.467
FEEL COLD FOR A SECOND.

08:00.467 --> 08:01.467
>> YEP.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.533
THAT'S COLD.

08:02.533 --> 08:05.167
>> SORRY, I'M ALMOST DONE.

08:05.167 --> 08:05.900
OKAY, THAT'S IT FOR THE

08:05.900 --> 08:07.100
SPECULUM.

08:07.100 --> 08:07.900
NOW I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A

08:07.900 --> 08:08.767
PELVIC EXAM.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.100
MY HANDS SHOULD BE MUCH WARMER.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.700
>> YES, THEY ARE, THANKS.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.533
[gasps]

08:16.533 --> 08:17.200
>> OW.

08:17.200 --> 08:17.867
>> OH, MY GOD.

08:17.867 --> 08:18.567
GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!

08:18.567 --> 08:19.233
>> I'M TRYING!

08:19.233 --> 08:19.900
LET GO OF MY HEAD.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.433
>> GET OUT, GET--

08:21.433 --> 08:22.133
GET OUT, GET OUT, OH, MY GOD.

08:22.133 --> 08:22.900
>> LET GO!

08:22.900 --> 08:25.633
OW.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.100
UH...

08:27.100 --> 08:27.867
[sighs]

08:27.867 --> 08:28.533
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

08:28.533 --> 08:29.333
EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT DOWN

08:29.333 --> 08:30.067
THERE.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.633
THANKS.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.967
>> OH, MY GOD.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.600
>> * YOU MAKE ME SAY

08:37.600 --> 08:38.700
[horse whinnying]

08:38.700 --> 08:39.400
* YOU MAKE ME SAY

08:39.400 --> 08:40.733
>> THIS IS SO COOL.

08:40.733 --> 08:41.500
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAD

08:41.500 --> 08:42.400
STABLES HERE.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.500
>> THIS IS WHERE MY FAMILY HAS

08:43.500 --> 08:45.067
ALWAYS BOARDED THEIR HORSES,

08:45.067 --> 08:46.400
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN AGES

08:46.400 --> 08:48.100
BECAUSE OF WORK.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.333
>> I GUESS THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM

08:49.333 --> 08:50.333
NOW.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.167
>> I HEARD ONE OF YOU WANTS TO

08:51.167 --> 08:52.233
RIDE DIABLO.

08:52.233 --> 08:52.900
I'VE GOT TO WARN YOU,

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
HE'S A LITTLE WILD.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.233
>> ANTONIO?

08:56.233 --> 08:57.900
>> RAQUEL.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.567
>> ANTONIO, HI.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.600
HOW ARE YOU?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.900
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:01.900 --> 09:03.167
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.500
>> I CAME BACK A FEW MONTHS AGO.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.067
GOD, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

09:07.067 --> 09:07.967
YOU TOO, KEISHA.

09:07.967 --> 09:08.933
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

09:08.933 --> 09:10.167
>> HEY, ANTONIO.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.233
LONG TIME.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.233
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.633
>> THIS IS OUR GIRL APRIL.

09:13.633 --> 09:14.300
>> HEY, APRIL.

09:14.300 --> 09:14.967
HOW YOU DOING?

09:14.967 --> 09:15.633
>> HELLO.

09:15.633 --> 09:16.300
>> PLEASURE.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.167
HERE YOU GO.

09:17.167 --> 09:17.967
IT'S OKAY, PAPI.

09:17.967 --> 09:18.633
IT'S OKAY.

09:18.633 --> 09:19.600
>> SO I HEARD YOU LEFT TO STUDY

09:19.600 --> 09:20.933
COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.067
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:22.067 --> 09:23.100
>> I WAS JUST DOING IT TO MAKE

09:23.100 --> 09:25.200
MY DAD HAPPY, YOU KNOW,

09:25.200 --> 09:27.300
BUT MY HEART WASN'T REALLY INTO

09:27.300 --> 09:28.300
GENETICALLY ENGINEERING

09:28.300 --> 09:29.067
SOYBEANS.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.167
>> [laughs]

09:30.167 --> 09:30.867
>> SO I CAME BACK TO MANAGE

09:30.867 --> 09:31.867
THE STABLES.

09:31.867 --> 09:32.767
>> WELL, WELCOME BACK.

09:32.767 --> 09:34.867
>> WELCOME BACK YOURSELF.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.067
SO I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

09:36.067 --> 09:38.333
POSSIBLE, BUT YOU LOOK MORE

09:38.333 --> 09:41.067
BEAUTIFUL THAN I REMEMBERED.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.667
YOU STILL THE RIDER I REMEMBER?

09:42.667 --> 09:43.533
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND

09:43.533 --> 09:45.167
OUT.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.300
[horse whinnies]

09:47.300 --> 09:50.800
>> * YOUR SECRET LOVE

09:50.800 --> 09:51.767
* LET ME BE

09:51.767 --> 09:53.367
>> YOU KNOW HE WAS MY FIRST.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.900
>> OF COURSE I KNOW.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.433
I SPENT THAT WHOLE SUMMER

09:56.433 --> 09:57.300
LEARNING TO PLAY BRIDGE,

09:57.300 --> 09:58.233
SO I COULD DISTRACT YOUR MOM,

09:58.233 --> 09:59.300
SO YOU COULD SNEAK OUT HERE

09:59.300 --> 10:00.333
AND RIDE ANTONIO.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.800
>> YOU MEAN RIDE WITH.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.367
>> WAS THERE A DIFFERENCE?

10:03.367 --> 10:04.033
>> WHY'D YOU GUYS HAVE

10:04.033 --> 10:04.700
A FALLING OUT?

10:04.700 --> 10:05.933
>> BECAUSE MY PARENTS FOUND OUT

10:05.933 --> 10:07.033
AND THREATENED TO GO TO HIS

10:07.033 --> 10:09.333
DAD'S BOSS AND GET HIM FIRED.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.333
SO WE HAD TO GO OUR SEPARATE

10:11.333 --> 10:13.700
WAYS.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.667
>> [scoffs]

10:23.667 --> 10:24.600
HAVE I TOLD YOU HOW GREAT YOU

10:24.600 --> 10:25.267
LOOK?

10:25.267 --> 10:26.300
>> THANK YOU, SEAN,

10:26.300 --> 10:27.100
BUT I WAS HOPING YOU CALLED ME

10:27.100 --> 10:28.500
DOWN HERE TO TELL ME MY ASSETS

10:28.500 --> 10:29.600
WERE UNFROZEN.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.500
>> HMM.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT

10:31.500 --> 10:32.733
THAT PRETTY ASSET DOWN

10:32.733 --> 10:37.567
FOR WHAT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.333
YOUR BOY MALCOLM SEEMS TO HAVE

10:39.333 --> 10:40.100
GOTTEN YOU IN A WORLD OF

10:40.100 --> 10:40.800
TROUBLE.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.567
>> WELL, TELL ME SOMETHING

10:41.567 --> 10:42.500
I DON'T KNOW.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.333
>> WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE

10:43.333 --> 10:44.767
DOES OR DOESN'T TELL THE FBI,

10:44.767 --> 10:45.867
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT IS

10:45.867 --> 10:46.867
COMING AFTER YOU.

10:46.867 --> 10:47.533
>> WH--

10:47.533 --> 10:48.800
>> I TRIED, BUT THERE'S NO WAY

10:48.800 --> 10:49.667
AROUND THIS.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.333
>> WE MADE A DEAL.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.200
THEY SAID IT WOULD ALL GO AWAY

10:52.200 --> 10:53.100
IF I GAVE UP MALCOLM,

10:53.100 --> 10:54.033
WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO

10:54.033 --> 10:55.933
BECAUSE HE CAME IN ON HIS OWN.

10:55.933 --> 10:57.500
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, HE THERE,

10:57.500 --> 10:58.367
DAMN IT.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.267
>> NO, THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU

10:59.267 --> 11:01.367
OWE THEM $200,000.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.067
SO WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT

11:02.067 --> 11:02.933
A PAYMENT PLAN.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.200
>> DAMN.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.633
I NEED MORE THAN A PAYMENT PLAN.

11:05.633 --> 11:07.233
I NEED A PRAYER.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.367
WHAT ABOUT MALCOLM?

11:08.367 --> 11:09.133
WHEN CAN I SEE HIM?

11:09.133 --> 11:09.967
>> I DON'T KNOW.

11:09.967 --> 11:10.900
UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT, THE FBI

11:10.900 --> 11:12.067
CAN KEEP HIM FOR AS LONG AS THEY

11:12.067 --> 11:12.700
WANT.

11:12.700 --> 11:13.800
>> OKAY, THIS IS ALL TOO MUCH

11:13.800 --> 11:14.500
NOW.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.200
>> YEAH, IT'S DEEP.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.500
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE GET OUT OF

11:18.500 --> 11:19.700
THIS STUFFY OFFICE AND

11:19.700 --> 11:23.067
STRATEGIZE OVER A BITE TO EAT?

11:23.067 --> 11:24.233
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF

11:24.233 --> 11:26.533
WE KEPT THIS STRICTLY BUSINESS,

11:26.533 --> 11:29.333
SO LET'S TALK HERE.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.767
>> OKAY.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.900
WELL, HERE'S SOME STANDARD

11:35.900 --> 11:38.900
PAYMENT SCHEDULES TO CONSIDER.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.600
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH SEAN?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.400
>> GIRL, I CAUGHT A LITTLE

11:53.400 --> 11:54.700
FLICKER WHEN WE HUGGED THAT

11:54.700 --> 11:55.733
FIRST NIGHT.

11:55.733 --> 11:56.800
BUT TODAY IN HIS OFFICE IT

11:56.800 --> 11:57.933
HAPPENED AGAIN, AND I WAS SO

11:57.933 --> 11:59.600
DISCOMBOBULATED WITH EVERYTHING,

11:59.600 --> 12:00.900
I HAD TO SHUT HIM DOWN.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.867
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CASE,

12:02.867 --> 12:04.267
BUT DO TELL.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.067
>> YOU SURE DID LOVE YOURSELF

12:05.067 --> 12:06.500
SOME SEAN BACK IN THE DAY.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.767
>> BACK IN THE DAY NOTHING.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.067
I SUSPECT THAT CANDLE IS STILL

12:09.067 --> 12:10.067
BURNING, WHICH MAKES YOU

12:10.067 --> 12:11.100
A TROLLOP.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.100
>> I WOULD NEVER GO THERE.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.300
I'M WITH MALCOLM.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.400
>> SHE'S STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT

12:14.400 --> 12:15.800
HER LITTLE FLICKER, SO LET'S LET

12:15.800 --> 12:16.833
THAT MARINATE.

12:16.833 --> 12:17.900
APRIL, IT'S A SLOW DAY.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.500
TELL ME YOUR STORY AGAIN.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.367
SO YOU HAD HIM IN A THIGH LOCK.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.167
>> OH, GOD.

12:22.167 --> 12:22.967
DON'T REMIND ME.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.267
MY FACE IS STILL HOT.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.633
HE'S BEEN TEXTING ME,

12:25.633 --> 12:27.300
APOLOGIZING, SINCE I LEFT.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.333
HE WANTS TO MAKE IT UP TO ME

12:28.333 --> 12:29.300
WITH DINNER.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.500
>> SO GO.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.267
YOU GOT FELT UP.

12:32.267 --> 12:33.500
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST GET A GOOD

12:33.500 --> 12:34.367
MEAL OUT OF IT.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.500
>> KEISHA.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.967
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

12:37.967 --> 12:38.933
>> YOU SHOULD DO WHAT YOU WANT

12:38.933 --> 12:39.667
TO DO.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.833
WHAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO SEE

12:40.833 --> 12:42.533
ANTONIO AT LUNCH.

12:42.533 --> 12:43.500
TRUST ME.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.933
I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY.

12:44.933 --> 12:45.967
IT'S BEST TO LISTEN TO YOUR

>> IS THAT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT

12:47.733 --> 12:48.400
NOW?

12:48.400 --> 12:49.933
I PREFER "FLOWER," BUT TO EACH

12:49.933 --> 12:50.867
HER OWN.

12:50.867 --> 12:51.533
>> I DON'T KNOW.

[chuckles]

13:08.933 --> 13:10.533
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME, GIRL?

13:10.533 --> 13:11.667
>> OH, THINK?

13:11.667 --> 13:12.900
TWO YEARS OF PILATES.

13:12.900 --> 13:13.767
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET THE

13:13.767 --> 13:14.800
SMACK DOWN.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.533
>> WELL, I'M NOT A SCRAWNY,

13:15.533 --> 13:16.767
LITTLE 17-YEAR-OLD ANYMORE,

13:16.767 --> 13:17.533

13:29.133 --> 13:30.167
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT

13:30.167 --> 13:32.600
THIS VERY SPOT?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
>> HOW COULD I FORGET?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.067
* WOULD YOU KEEP IT

13:43.067 --> 13:44.100
* WRAP IT UP

>> MOTHER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

14:25.067 --> 14:25.700
HERE?

14:25.700 --> 14:26.533
I THOUGHT YOU RODE ON

14:26.533 --> 14:27.633
WEDNESDAYS.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.833
>> WELL, APPARENTLY THINGS

14:28.833 --> 14:29.633
CHANGE.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.633
LADIES, IF YOU'D EXCUSE ME,

14:31.633 --> 14:32.600
I'D LIKE A FEW WORDS WITH MY

14:32.600 --> 14:33.567
DAUGHTER.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.067
>> MRS. LANCASTER, I CAN

14:35.067 --> 14:35.767
EXPLAIN.

>> I'M SURE THERE'S A CORRAL

14:36.900 --> 14:37.967
THAT NEEDS RAKING.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.400
PLEASE SEE TO IT PROMPTLY.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.567
OR SHALL I SPEAK TO YOUR BOSS?

14:42.567 --> 14:43.600
>> YOU OKAY?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.600
>> YEAH.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.067
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING

14:52.067 --> 14:53.067
WITH YOUR LIFE?

14:53.067 --> 14:54.167
>> LIVING IT THE WAY I WANT

14:54.167 --> 14:55.467
TO LIVE IT FOR ONCE.

14:55.467 --> 14:56.233
>> HOW?

14:56.233 --> 14:57.800
BY BLOWING OFF YOUR ENGAGEMENT,

14:57.800 --> 14:58.900
QUITTING YOUR JOB, AND

14:58.900 --> 15:01.633
CANOODLING WITH THE HORSE BOY?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.333
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.433
>> WELL, THAT'S A SHAME, MOTHER,

15:04.433 --> 15:05.900
BECAUSE I'VE WORKED SO HARD

15:05.900 --> 15:06.967
TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.367
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A DIME FROM YOU

15:08.367 --> 15:09.933
SINCE COLLEGE, BUT YOU STILL

15:09.933 --> 15:11.300
WANT TO RUN MY LIFE.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.767
>> WELL, SOMEONE NEEDS TO.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.333
NEVER DREAMED YOU'D TURN OUT

15:14.333 --> 15:15.267
LIKE THIS.

15:15.267 --> 15:16.167
>> LIKE WHAT?

15:16.167 --> 15:17.833
MOTHER, I WENT TO THE SCHOOLS

15:17.833 --> 15:18.833
YOU WANTED ME TO GO TO,

15:18.833 --> 15:20.167
I DATED THE MEN YOU WANTED ME

15:20.167 --> 15:21.900
TO DATE, BUT WHEN DOES RAQUEL

15:21.900 --> 15:22.833
GET TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR

15:22.833 --> 15:23.633
RAQUEL?

15:23.633 --> 15:24.933
MY GOD, YOU'RE SUCH

15:24.933 --> 15:25.800
A CONTROL FREAK.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.900
>> YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO

15:26.900 --> 15:28.267
YOU ARE, BUT YOU HAD BETTER

15:28.267 --> 15:29.500
REMEMBER WHO I AM.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
YOU WILL NOT TALK TO ME WITH

15:30.500 --> 15:31.367
THAT TONE.

15:31.367 --> 15:32.933
>> I'M SORRY.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.567
YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY OWN FAULT.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.567
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

15:35.567 --> 15:36.800
YOU'VE HAD THIS HOLD OVER ME,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.767
BUT THIS IS WHERE IT STOPS.

15:38.767 --> 15:39.567
>> AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED

15:39.567 --> 15:40.200
TO MEAN?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.067
>> I'M CLEANING HOUSE,

15:41.067 --> 15:42.267
IN EVERY AREA OF MY LIFE,

15:42.267 --> 15:44.133
AND I'M GETTING RID OF ANYTHING

15:44.133 --> 15:45.233
THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF MY TRUE

15:45.233 --> 15:45.900
PASSION.

15:45.900 --> 15:46.733
>> PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THIS IS

15:46.733 --> 15:47.467
ABOUT THAT LITTLE STREET

15:47.467 --> 15:48.867
BOUTIQUE AGAIN.

15:48.867 --> 15:50.567
>> YOU KNOW FASHION HAS ALWAYS

15:50.567 --> 15:51.567
BEEN SOMETHING I WANTED TO

15:51.567 --> 15:53.700
PURSUE.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.433
BUT YOU DIDN'T APPROVE,

15:55.433 --> 15:56.900
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

15:56.900 --> 16:00.900
APPROVE OF ME BUYING THE SHOP.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.800
BUT THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE

16:02.800 --> 16:04.167
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA

16:04.167 --> 16:05.400
DO.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.300
>> RAQUEL, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.667
>> MOTHER, PLEASE JUST GET WITH

16:07.667 --> 16:09.667
THE PROGRAM.

16:12.533 --> 16:13.533
YOU'LL GET USED TO THE NEW

16:13.533 --> 16:14.633
RAQUEL.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.067
I AM.

16:16.067 --> 16:19.067
I'M LOVING HER.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.433
>> * WAY-OH-OH-OH*

16:21.433 --> 16:23.067
* WAY-OH-OH-OH*

16:23.067 --> 16:25.500
* WAY-OH-OH-OH*

16:25.500 --> 16:26.633
>> WOW, EVERYTHING LOOKS REALLY

16:26.633 --> 16:27.500
GOOD HERE.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.833
>> EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.100
UH--

16:30.100 --> 16:31.300
>> OKAY.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.133
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

16:32.133 --> 16:33.767
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.267
>> WELL, AFTER THE...

16:36.267 --> 16:37.867
OFFICE, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE

16:37.867 --> 16:38.767
YOU AGAIN.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.200
>> OH, GOD, NEITHER DID I.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.067
NO, BUT EVEN THOUGH I WAS

16:42.067 --> 16:44.167
MORTIFIED, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST

16:44.167 --> 16:45.100
ANOTHER DAY AT WORK FOR YOU,

16:45.100 --> 16:46.300
LIKE, NOT THAT BIG A DEAL,

16:46.300 --> 16:46.967
RIGHT?

16:46.967 --> 16:48.200
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, IT WAS.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.100
LOOK, I HOPE I'M NOT BEING TOO

16:50.100 --> 16:52.200
FORWARD HERE OR UNPROFESSIONAL,

16:52.200 --> 16:53.567
BUT I HAVE LITERALLY SEEN

16:53.567 --> 16:54.600
THOUSANDS OF THEM,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.567
AND YOURS IS AMAZING.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.333
I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

16:59.333 --> 17:00.433
BEAUTIFUL ONES I'VE EVER SEEN

17:00.433 --> 17:01.300
IN MY LIFE.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.467
I'M STILL REELING FROM IT.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.700
>> REALLY?

17:03.700 --> 17:04.733
WELL, I MEAN, YEAH,

17:04.733 --> 17:05.733
I ALWAYS DID THINK

17:05.733 --> 17:06.933
IT WAS KIND OF SPECIAL.

17:06.933 --> 17:07.700
>> OH, IT IS.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.767
[chuckles]

17:08.767 --> 17:11.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:11.333 --> 17:12.200
I'M SORRY.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.100
I SHOULD STOP MYSELF.

17:13.100 --> 17:13.767
>> NO.

17:13.767 --> 17:14.433
NO, NO, NO.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.100
KEEP GOING.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.667
>> ARE YOU READY TO ORDER?

17:16.667 --> 17:18.333
>> UM, NO, I'M SORRY.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.300
I NEED ANOTHER MINUTE.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.067
>> SURE.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.067
>> SAY, WOULD YOU ALLOW ME

17:23.067 --> 17:24.167
TO ORDER FOR YOU?

17:24.167 --> 17:25.267
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN

17:25.267 --> 17:26.333

17:35.367 --> 17:37.700
CITRUS, FOR STARTERS.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.567
>> WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE HAVING

17:38.567 --> 17:40.567
A FRUIT SALAD, THEN.

17:41.733 --> 17:42.733
[upbeat electronic music]

17:42.733 --> 17:49.300

17:49.300 --> 17:50.833

17:50.833 --> 17:52.633
PRECIOUS LITTLE RAQUEL FINALLY

17:52.633 --> 17:53.733
TOLD HER MOTHER OFF

17:53.733 --> 17:55.467
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

17:55.467 --> 17:59.133
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.700
DID SHE TURN BLUE OR PURPLE?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.100
AND DID YOU GET A PICTURE?

18:02.100 --> 18:02.967
>> I DIDN'T GET A PICTURE,

18:02.967 --> 18:05.233
BUT SHE WAS, AS THEY SAY,

18:05.233 --> 18:06.667
HOTTER THAN FISH GREASE.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.533
>> [laughs]

18:07.533 --> 18:09.200
SO HOW DID IT END?

18:09.200 --> 18:10.333
>> I TOLD HER I'M BUYING V.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.133
>> YOU ARE?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.067
DON'T PLAY WITH ME, GIRL.

18:12.067 --> 18:12.900
>> I'M NOT PLAYING.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.067
JUST LIKE THAT SUMMER WE WERE

18:14.067 --> 18:16.367
DETERMINED TO GO SEE LL COOL J.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.500
YOU THOUGHT WE SHOULD SNEAK OUT,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.133
BUT I WAS LIKE, "I'M PRACTICALLY

18:20.133 --> 18:21.267
GROWN.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.100
I WILL SIMPLY CALL MY MOTHER

18:23.100 --> 18:24.200
AND TELL HER WHERE WE ARE

18:24.200 --> 18:25.100
AS A COURTESY."

18:25.100 --> 18:25.767
>> AFTER I DID ALL THE

18:25.767 --> 18:26.633
FAST TALKING TO GET US

18:26.633 --> 18:28.433
BACKSTAGE, SHE POLITELY CAME

18:28.433 --> 18:29.467
AND SNATCHED US RIGHT OUT OF

18:29.467 --> 18:31.067
LL'S DRESSING ROOM.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.100
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.433
>> THAT'S SELECTIVE AMNESIA,

18:34.433 --> 18:35.800
BROUGHT ON BY EMBARRASSING

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
MAMA TRAUMA.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.500
>> [laughing]

18:39.500 --> 18:40.600
>> SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, GIRL,

18:40.600 --> 18:41.500
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BUY

18:41.500 --> 18:42.333
THIS SHOP?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.533
THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE.

18:43.533 --> 18:44.533
>> I'M GONNA HAVE TO USE ALL OF

18:44.533 --> 18:47.567
MY SAVINGS, WHICH IS SCARY,

18:47.567 --> 18:48.667
BUT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT

18:48.667 --> 18:49.600
THAT, RIGHT?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.067
I'M LEARNING THAT IF I LEAP,

18:51.067 --> 18:52.333
THE NET WILL APPEAR.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.467
>> YEAH, TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE

18:54.467 --> 18:55.967
WHOSE BUTT HURTS FROM HITTING

18:55.967 --> 18:57.300
THE GROUND A FEW TIMES,

18:57.300 --> 18:59.067
BEING OUT HERE WITHOUT A NET

18:59.067 --> 19:01.433
IS FOR THE BIRDS.

19:04.267 --> 19:06.067
>> THAT'S WHY YOU INSPIRE ME.

19:06.067 --> 19:06.767
WATCHING YOU HAS TAUGHT ME

19:06.767 --> 19:08.233
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.267
>> AW.

19:09.267 --> 19:10.067
>> YOU HAVEN'T HAD IT EASY,

19:10.067 --> 19:11.200
BUT YOU'VE NEVER LET THAT

19:11.200 --> 19:12.067
STOP YOU.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.300
>> AND YOU'VE HAD IT SO EASY,

19:13.300 --> 19:14.367
YOU MIGHT BE ROMANTICIZING

19:14.367 --> 19:15.267
STRUGGLE.

19:15.267 --> 19:16.867
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU

19:16.867 --> 19:18.633
TO BUY THIS PLACE, YOU MIGHT

19:18.633 --> 19:19.800
WANT TO THINK TWICE.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.733
>> PLEASE DON'T SOUND LIKE

19:20.733 --> 19:22.133
EVELYN RIGHT NOW AND TRY TO KILL

19:22.133 --> 19:23.133
MY DREAMS.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.067
>> DAMN.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.267
WELL, SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

19:26.267 --> 19:29.633
YOU'VE GOT MY SUPPORT 100%.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.733
[chuckles]

19:36.400 --> 19:37.900
>> I KNOW HE DOES NOT HAVE OUR

19:37.900 --> 19:39.633
BABY IN MY OVERNIGHT BAG.

19:39.633 --> 19:40.800
>> YOUR BABY?

19:40.800 --> 19:41.700

19:41.700 --> 19:42.367
>> ADOPTED?

19:42.367 --> 19:43.100
>> PEANUT.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.767
I NEED TO FOCUS ON FAMILY.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.433
EXCUSE ME.

19:45.433 --> 19:46.367
DEREK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:46.367 --> 19:47.633
>> I GOT CALLED IN ON A JOB.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.300
YOU GOTTA TAKE PEANUT.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.633
>> IT MAY SEEM LIKE AN ALL-DAY

19:49.633 --> 19:50.700
PARTY IN HERE, BUT WE WORK

19:50.700 --> 19:51.700
REALLY HARD TO CULTIVATE

19:51.700 --> 19:52.367
THAT VIBE.

19:52.367 --> 19:53.700
PLEASE DON'T ACT LIKE YOUR JOB

19:53.700 --> 19:55.100
IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE TOOLS

19:55.100 --> 19:55.900
ARE INVOLVED.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.467
>> OMAR, YOU KNOW I CAN'T TAKE

19:57.467 --> 19:59.233
PEANUT TO A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

19:59.233 --> 20:00.500
PLUS, IT IS YOUR TURN TO BABYSIT

20:00.500 --> 20:01.300
HER ANYWAY.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.200
>> YOU CAN'T BABYSIT

20:03.200 --> 20:05.300
YOUR OWN CHILD.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.533
IT'S OKAY, PRECIOUS.

20:06.533 --> 20:08.100
DADDY DEREK IS STUPID.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.000
>> DADDY DEREK IS TRYING

20:09.000 --> 20:10.633
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.333
HERE, HER FOOD, TOYS,

20:12.333 --> 20:14.000
AND BLANKIE ARE ALL IN THIS BAG,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.133
AND PLEASE TRY NOT TO SPOIL HER

20:15.133 --> 20:17.133
MORE THAN YOU ALREADY DO.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.333
>> ADORABLE.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.633
>> OH, LET ME HOLD HER.

20:22.633 --> 20:23.967
SHE IS SO CUTE.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.633
>> ARE YOUR HANDS CLEAN?

20:26.633 --> 20:27.500
>> OMAR, DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE

20:27.500 --> 20:31.067
MOTHERS.

20:31.067 --> 20:33.000
OH...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.867
SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.233
>> INCREDIBLE.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.700
I, ACCORDING TO A LICENSED

20:38.700 --> 20:39.633
EXPERT IN THE FIELD,

20:39.633 --> 20:41.300
HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

20:41.300 --> 20:43.467
HONEYPOTS.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.700
YOU KNOW, MY HUSH PUPPY.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.967
MY COOKIE.

20:47.967 --> 20:49.300
>> ALL MEN SAY THAT WHEN THEY'RE

20:49.300 --> 20:50.633
TRYING TO GET IT.

20:50.633 --> 20:51.700
DON'T TELL ME YOU FELL FOR THAT.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.000
>> NO, SERIOUSLY.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.567
THIS MAN IS BOARD-CERTIFIED.

20:54.567 --> 20:55.967
THIS IS NOT AN OPINION.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.733
>> WELL, THIS WE HAVE TO SEE.

20:57.733 --> 20:58.400
>> MM-HMM.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.267
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE WITH THAT

20:59.267 --> 21:00.500
KIND OF PRONOUNCEMENT

21:00.500 --> 21:01.667
AND NOT BACK IT UP WITH PROOF.

21:01.667 --> 21:02.633
>> YOU REALLY WANT ME TO SHOW

21:02.633 --> 21:03.300
YOU?

21:03.300 --> 21:04.467
>> MM-HMM.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.700
>> THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD, GUYS.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.533
>> IF WE ARE INDEED IN THE

21:06.533 --> 21:08.367
PRESENCE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY

21:08.367 --> 21:10.100
HOO-HA, THE COUNCIL MUST

21:10.100 --> 21:11.200
CONFIRM.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.100
>> AGREED.

21:12.100 --> 21:12.967
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.900
LET'S CONFIRM.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.867
>> * I GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE

21:16.867 --> 21:18.700

>> * I LIKE TO PLAY

21:25.433 --> 21:26.667
*I LIKE TO TEASE *

21:26.667 --> 21:28.467
>> * FREAKY, FREAKY, WOW, WOW

21:28.467 --> 21:29.167
>> * YOU KNOW I GET

21:29.167 --> 21:30.633

21:30.633 --> 21:33.300

21:33.300 --> 21:35.233
>> I STAND CORRECTED.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.100
>> I MUST ADMIT, I'VE ONLY SEEN

21:37.100 --> 21:39.067
ONE BETTER.

21:39.067 --> 21:40.200
>> APRIL, IF THAT WERE ON A

21:40.200 --> 21:42.500
STICK, I'D BE IN LOVE.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.100
>> SEAN.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:51.267 --> 21:52.267
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL

21:52.267 --> 21:53.433
AND TEXT YOU ALL MORNING.

21:53.433 --> 21:54.900
NO RESPONSE.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.700
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.833
I'VE BEEN IN THE KITCHEN.

22:00.833 --> 22:02.633
AND I FORGOT TO TAKE IT OFF

22:02.633 --> 22:03.667
SILENT.

22:03.667 --> 22:04.533
>> YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO PRESENT

22:04.533 --> 22:05.300
YOUR PAYMENT PLAN TO THE IRS

22:05.300 --> 22:06.167
TODAY, KEISHA.

22:06.167 --> 22:06.933
>> FINE.

22:06.933 --> 22:08.133
CAN WE TALK ABOUT MY VERY BLEAK

22:08.133 --> 22:10.500
FINANCIAL FUTURE OVER PANCAKES?

22:10.500 --> 22:11.200
AT LEAST ONE OF THE THINGS

22:11.200 --> 22:12.267
I HAVE TO SWALLOW THIS MORNING

22:12.267 --> 22:13.400
WILL TASTE GOOD.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.200
>> BANANA OR BLUEBERRY?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.633
>> SEAN, I'M IN PAIN.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.233
>> AH, CHOCOLATE CHIP.

22:18.233 --> 22:19.433
COULDN'T COOK AN ENTREE

22:19.433 --> 22:20.267
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU

22:20.267 --> 22:22.200
ALWAYS KILLED IT AT BREAKFAST.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.267
HEY, COUNT ME IN.

22:29.967 --> 22:31.233
MMM.

22:31.233 --> 22:32.800
SO IF YOU CAN MANAGE

22:32.800 --> 22:34.667
FIVE MONTHS AT 5 GRAND PER,

22:34.667 --> 22:35.567
AND A BALLOON PAYMENT

22:35.567 --> 22:36.700
OF $50,000 AT THE END

22:36.700 --> 22:37.900
OF THE SIX-MONTH MARK,

22:37.900 --> 22:39.233
I CAN GET THEM TO SETTLE FOR--

22:39.233 --> 22:40.733
>> PLEASE.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.100
STOP.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.800
ALL THOSE NUMBERS ARE DEPRESSING

22:43.800 --> 22:46.967
ME--AND THE PANCAKES.

22:46.967 --> 22:48.167
CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

22:48.167 --> 22:49.067
FOR A MINUTE?

22:49.067 --> 22:50.267
>> UH, YEAH.

22:50.267 --> 22:51.200
LIKE WHAT?

22:51.200 --> 22:54.067
>> LIKE, HOW ARE YOU?

22:54.067 --> 22:55.267
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO FOR

22:55.267 --> 22:56.467
THE PAST SIX YEARS?

22:56.467 --> 23:00.167
>> WELL, UH, OTHER THAN WORK,

23:00.167 --> 23:01.467
BEING A FATHER IS ALL I'VE HAD

23:01.467 --> 23:03.100
TIME FOR.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.100
OH, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FLINGS

23:04.100 --> 23:05.467
HERE AND THERE, BUT NO ONE

23:05.467 --> 23:06.633
REALLY SPECIAL.

23:06.633 --> 23:07.367
>> ROUGH OUT THERE, HUH?

23:07.367 --> 23:08.900
>> YEAH, APPARENTLY SO.

23:08.900 --> 23:09.800
SEEMS ALL THE GOOD ONES

23:09.800 --> 23:11.633
ARE TAKEN OR RUNNING BEHIND MEN

23:11.633 --> 23:12.800
WHO ARE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.900
>> SEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW MAL.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.333
>> NO, BUT I KNOW YOU,

23:17.333 --> 23:18.633
AND THE KEISHA GREENE I REMEMBER

23:18.633 --> 23:19.667
WOULD NEVER BE CAUGHT OUT THERE

23:19.667 --> 23:20.467
LIKE THIS,

23:20.467 --> 23:22.067
ESPECIALLY OVER SOME GUY.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.633
>> MALCOLM ISN'T JUST SOME GUY

23:23.633 --> 23:25.967
TO ME, SEAN.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.233
YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE.

23:27.233 --> 23:29.933
>> LOOK, AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN

23:29.933 --> 23:32.667
THROUGH, I KNOW I STILL OWE YOU

23:32.667 --> 23:34.067
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.200
SO IF YOU NEED ME TO, I CAN MAKE

23:35.200 --> 23:36.667
SOME OF THOSE PAYMENTS FOR YOU.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.667
>> AW...

23:37.667 --> 23:39.633
SEAN, THANK YOU.

23:39.633 --> 23:40.767
COMING FROM YOU, THAT MEANS

23:40.767 --> 23:43.333
A LOT.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.567
[knock on door]

23:45.567 --> 23:47.800
OH.

23:55.567 --> 23:56.400
[laughing] HI.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.600
>> HEY.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.667
>> WHAT--SO WAIT.

24:00.667 --> 24:01.767
DOES THIS MEAN EVERYTHING

24:01.767 --> 24:02.633
IS COOL NOW?

24:02.633 --> 24:03.667
>> YEAH, THEY ARRESTED THE MAYOR

24:03.667 --> 24:05.067
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

24:05.067 --> 24:06.067
I'M IN THE CLEAR, BABY.

24:06.067 --> 24:07.733
>> OH, THANK GOD.

24:07.733 --> 24:09.867
[chuckles]

24:21.567 --> 24:22.500
>> RELAX, MALCOLM.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.700
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS STRICTLY

24:23.700 --> 24:24.633
PROFESSIONAL.

24:24.633 --> 24:25.467
>> REALLY?

24:25.467 --> 24:26.300
SO DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE BUSINESS

24:26.300 --> 24:27.233
MEETINGS WEARING A BATHROBE?

24:27.233 --> 24:28.167
>> WATCH IT.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.067
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEEN HIDING

24:29.067 --> 24:30.533
OUT WITH OUR EX-WIFE.

24:30.533 --> 24:31.267
>> I HAD NO CHOICE, KEISHA.

24:31.267 --> 24:31.967
I WAS TRYING TO STAY OUT

24:31.967 --> 24:32.633
OF JAIL.

24:32.633 --> 24:33.667
>> EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

24:33.667 --> 24:34.800
>> LISTEN, MAN.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.633
I APPRECIATE YOU HELPING OUT

24:35.633 --> 24:37.867
MY GIRL, BUT KEISHA DOESN'T NEED

24:37.867 --> 24:38.800
AN ATTORNEY ANYMORE.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.900
>> OH, ACTUALLY SHE DOES.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.567
SHE STILL OWES $200,000

24:41.567 --> 24:42.833
TO THE IRS.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.233
>> YEAH, SEAN HAS HELPED ME WORK

24:44.233 --> 24:46.467
OUT A REPAYMENT STRATEGY.

24:46.467 --> 24:47.900
>> I GOT A BETTER ONE.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.400
I'LL PAY IT.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.533
>> [chuckles]

24:50.533 --> 24:52.633
MALCOLM, THANK YOU.

24:52.633 --> 24:53.767
>> OH, BABY, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS

24:53.767 --> 24:57.100
TAKE CARE OF MINE.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.433
AND, UM, SEAN?

24:59.433 --> 25:00.233
>> SEAN.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.367
>> SEAN, YOUR SERVICES ARE NO

25:01.367 --> 25:02.300
LONGER NECESSARY.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.367
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHY DON'T

25:03.367 --> 25:04.533
YOU SEND YOUR BILL TO MY OFFICE

25:04.533 --> 25:05.200
AS WELL?

25:05.200 --> 25:07.533
>> OH, I'M NOT CHARGING KEISHA.

25:07.533 --> 25:09.300
>> MM.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.300
>> AND I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF

25:10.300 --> 25:13.733
BREAKFAST.

25:13.733 --> 25:14.733
>> UH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN

25:14.733 --> 25:15.400
US?

25:15.400 --> 25:17.400
>> YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I WOULD.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.100
>> OH.

25:33.167 --> 25:35.467
>> [giggles]

25:39.800 --> 25:40.467
>> [chuckles]

25:40.467 --> 25:42.967
>> SO WHO WANTS COFFEE?

25:42.967 --> 25:44.967
>> both: ME.

25:44.967 --> 25:46.600
>> OKAY.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
I THINK I'LL MAKE A FRESH POT.

25:51.267 --> 25:52.600
>> I DON'T KNOW, KEISHA.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.633
IT'S TOO RISKY TO GO INTO

25:53.633 --> 25:54.467
BUSINESS WITH SOMEONE WHO'S

25:54.467 --> 25:55.700
NEVER RUN A STORE BEFORE.

25:55.700 --> 25:57.067
I HAVE A SIZABLE INVESTMENT

25:57.067 --> 25:57.900
IN V, AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

25:57.900 --> 25:59.300
LOSE IT FOR YOUR FRIEND.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.500
>> YEAH, OKAY, BUT SHE'S NOT

26:00.500 --> 26:01.433
JUST MY FRIEND.

26:01.433 --> 26:03.167
VAL'S GIVEN HER BLESSING TOO.

26:03.167 --> 26:04.800
>> BUT I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.933
I'M NOT GOING INTO BUSINESS

26:05.933 --> 26:07.067
WITH A STRANGER.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.067
WOULD YOU GO INTO BUSINESS WITH

26:08.067 --> 26:09.400
SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

26:09.400 --> 26:12.333
>> YEAH, IF THEY WERE QUALIFIED.

26:12.333 --> 26:13.467
>> WELL, YOUR FRIEND'S NOT

26:13.467 --> 26:15.233
QUALIFIED, SO THAT BRINGS US

26:15.233 --> 26:18.767
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

26:18.767 --> 26:19.700
>> HEY, OMAR.

26:19.700 --> 26:20.367
>> HEY.

26:20.367 --> 26:21.167
>> COULD YOU WRAP MY STUFF UP,

26:21.167 --> 26:22.933
PLEASE?

26:22.933 --> 26:24.067
ARE YOU STILL GAY?

26:24.067 --> 26:25.800
'CAUSE YOU ARE GETTING CUTER.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.067
>> YES, I AM.

26:27.067 --> 26:27.867
TO BOTH.

26:27.867 --> 26:30.867
>> DAMN.

26:30.867 --> 26:32.367
>> YOU KNOW, I WASN'T GOING TO

26:32.367 --> 26:33.533
BRING THIS UP BEFORE BECAUSE I

26:33.533 --> 26:34.467
WAS REALLY ROOTING FOR MY

26:34.467 --> 26:36.300
FRIEND, BUT I'VE BEEN APPROACHED

26:36.300 --> 26:38.067
BY ANOTHER BUYER WHO'S BEEN IN

26:38.067 --> 26:39.700
RETAIL FOR TEN YEARS.

26:39.700 --> 26:40.567
>> OH.

26:40.567 --> 26:41.400
>> MM-HMM.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.467
SHE MAY BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

26:42.467 --> 26:43.133
FOR.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.767
>> ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.133
SET UP A MEETING FOR FRIDAY.

26:46.133 --> 26:46.833
>> GOT IT.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.333
IS SAFE.

35:23.333 --> 35:24.733
CONGRATULATIONS, PARTNER.

35:24.733 --> 35:27.467
>> [chuckles]

35:27.467 --> 35:28.767
[sighs]

35:28.767 --> 35:29.667
WELL, AFTER YOU GUYS FINISH

35:29.667 --> 35:31.100
HUGGING IT OUT, I'LL TAKE A NEW

35:31.100 --> 35:32.767
COUCH AS MY COMMISSION,

35:32.767 --> 35:33.867
SINCE I SEEM TO BROKER A LOT

35:33.867 --> 35:34.833
OF DEALS IN HERE.

35:34.833 --> 35:39.167
[laughter]

35:39.167 --> 35:41.100
SO WITH ANTONIO, WAS THE SECOND

35:41.100 --> 35:42.733
TIME AROUND AS GOOD AS THE

35:42.733 --> 35:44.167
FIRST?

35:44.167 --> 35:44.867
>> BETTER.

35:44.867 --> 35:46.433
>> [gasps]

35:46.433 --> 35:47.200
>> I'M GOING RIDING AGAIN

35:47.200 --> 35:48.700
TONIGHT.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.800
>> OOH.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.333
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU, COWGIRL.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.267
WHAT ABOUT YOU, APRIL?

35:53.267 --> 35:54.100
YOU HOOKING UP WITH

35:54.100 --> 35:55.400
DR. VAJAYJAY?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.967
>> NOPE.

35:56.967 --> 35:57.933
I BROKE IT OFF.

35:57.933 --> 35:58.600
>> WHAT?

35:58.600 --> 35:59.533
>> WHY?

35:59.533 --> 36:01.167
>> LADIES, HONESTLY, I NEVER

36:01.167 --> 36:02.167
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SAY THIS,

36:02.167 --> 36:03.833
BUT IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH OF

36:03.833 --> 36:04.700
A GOOD THING.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.367
>> MM-MM.

36:05.367 --> 36:06.967
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT.

36:06.967 --> 36:07.933
>> ME TOO.

36:07.933 --> 36:08.833
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.567
>> ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

36:09.567 --> 36:10.400
WHO ARE YOU SEEING TONIGHT,

36:10.400 --> 36:11.233
KEISH?

36:11.233 --> 36:12.067
>> MALCOLM, OF COURSE.

36:12.067 --> 36:13.067
WHO ELSE?

36:13.067 --> 36:13.767
>> I DON'T KNOW.

36:13.767 --> 36:14.933
MAYBE SEAN,

36:14.933 --> 36:16.167
THE GUY WHO KISSED THE HELL

36:16.167 --> 36:17.367
OUT OF YOU YESTERDAY.

36:17.367 --> 36:18.400
>> AND HE WAS WAY OUT OF LINE

36:18.400 --> 36:19.067
WITH THAT.

36:19.067 --> 36:19.800
>> WAS HE?

36:19.800 --> 36:20.600
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE INTO

36:20.600 --> 36:21.267
IT.

36:21.267 --> 36:21.933
>> [laughs]

36:21.933 --> 36:23.200
I'M GONNA TELL YOU LIKE I TOLD

36:23.200 --> 36:25.100
HIM: I GOT A MAN.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.767
NOT INTERESTED.

36:28.767 --> 36:29.967
>> GOT THE BUBBLY.

36:29.967 --> 36:31.300
>> YES.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.500
>> WHERE'S PEANUT?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.433
>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

36:35.433 --> 36:36.700
>> NO, I LEFT HER HERE.

36:36.700 --> 36:37.533
>> WOW.

36:37.533 --> 36:38.700
SHE'S BEEN REALLY QUIET.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.467
>> PEANUT?

36:40.467 --> 36:44.233
PEANUT?

36:44.233 --> 36:45.167
NO.

36:45.167 --> 36:47.100
NO, NO, NO!

36:47.100 --> 36:48.500
>> [gasps]

36:48.500 --> 36:49.200
>> OMAR!

36:49.200 --> 36:50.400
THOSE WERE THE PUMPS I HAD

36:50.400 --> 36:51.667
ON HOLD.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.533
>> THAT IS COMING OUT OF YOUR

36:52.533 --> 36:53.367
PAYCHECK.

36:53.367 --> 36:55.233
>> THOSE BABIES WERE $800.

36:55.233 --> 36:56.167
MAKE THAT YOUR NEXT THREE

36:56.167 --> 36:56.833
PAYCHECKS.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.367
>> BAD! BAD DOG!

36:58.367 --> 36:59.100
GIVE ME THOSE.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.067
>> [barks]

37:00.067 --> 37:01.067
>> [gasps]

37:01.067 --> 37:02.333
>> THAT'S IT.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.767
YOU'RE TOO SPOILED.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.867
YOU'RE SO DAMN CUTE.

37:06.867 --> 37:08.867
COME HERE.

37:10.367 --> 37:14.200
>> *LA, LA, LA, LA *

37:14.200 --> 37:17.533
*LA, LA, LA, LA *

37:17.533 --> 37:19.167
*LA, LA, LA, LA *

37:19.167 --> 37:20.800
>> HERE YOU GO.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.100
CONGRATULATIONS

37:23.100 --> 37:27.800
TO THE NEW OWNER OF V.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.533
RAQUEL, I WISH YOU MUCH SUCCESS

37:30.533 --> 37:32.067
AND PASSION.

37:32.067 --> 37:33.067
>> AND MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS

37:33.067 --> 37:34.067
COME TRUE.

37:34.067 --> 37:35.167
>> THIS HAS BEEN THE CRAZIEST

37:35.167 --> 37:36.533
TIME IN MY LIFE.

37:36.533 --> 37:37.667
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE AND

37:37.667 --> 37:38.733
SUPPORT.

37:38.733 --> 37:39.967
I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.267
>> WE GOT YOU, GIRL.

37:41.267 --> 37:43.300
>> TO TAKING RISKS

37:43.300 --> 37:44.333
AND BEING IN CHARGE OF OUR OWN

37:44.333 --> 37:45.067
DESTINY.

37:45.067 --> 37:47.200
>> HERE, HERE.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.133
>> GOD, I HOPE THIS WORKS.

37:50.133 --> 37:53.067

[pop music]

37:54.067 --> 37:56.533

37:56.533 --> 37:57.200

* THE CITY LIGHTS

37:58.300 --> 37:59.100
* DRIFTING THROUGH

37:59.100 --> 38:01.067
* THE ATMOSPHERE

38:01.067 --> 38:02.967
>> MMM.

38:02.967 --> 38:04.300
THAT'S THE SPOT.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.467
>> MM.

38:05.467 --> 38:06.233
I'M STARTING TO WONDER

38:06.233 --> 38:07.067
IF YOU MISSED ME OR MY TALENTED

38:07.067 --> 38:07.933
HANDS.

38:07.933 --> 38:11.333
>> BOTH.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.100
[phone vibrating]

38:27.467 --> 38:29.933
>> YEAH.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.600
OKAY, THEN I'LL JUST TRANSFER

38:32.600 --> 38:33.667
ANOTHER 10,000 INTO YOUR

38:33.667 --> 38:35.700
CHECKING ACCOUNT.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.767
OH, NO PROBLEM.

38:37.767 --> 38:39.400
GOOD NIGHT.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.067
>> WHY IS ASHLEE CALLING YOU?

38:41.067 --> 38:42.167
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

38:42.167 --> 38:43.067
WHY ARE YOU STILL GIVING HER

38:43.067 --> 38:43.800
MONEY?

38:43.800 --> 38:44.667
>> BECAUSE SHE CAN STILL BURY

38:44.667 --> 38:46.067
ME WITH THE FBI.

38:46.067 --> 38:47.067
I HAVE TO KEEP HER HAPPY

38:47.067 --> 38:48.500
THE NEXT THREE YEARS,

38:48.500 --> 38:49.400
AT LEAST UNTIL THE STATUTE

38:49.400 --> 38:51.200
OF LIMITATIONS RUNS OUT.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.267
>> THREE YEARS?

38:52.267 --> 38:53.800
I THOUGHT ONCE ASHLEE WAS IN

38:53.800 --> 38:54.867
THE IVORY COAST, SHE'D FINALLY

38:54.867 --> 38:55.700
BE OUT OF OUR LIVES.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.367
>> SHE IS.

38:56.367 --> 38:57.267
SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

38:57.267 --> 38:57.933
WITH US.

38:57.933 --> 38:58.633
>> MALCOLM, PLEASE.

38:58.633 --> 39:00.733
SHE KNOWS IT'S MIDNIGHT HERE,

39:00.733 --> 39:02.867
AND YET SHE STILL CALLS ANYWAY.

39:02.867 --> 39:04.367
>> LET IT GO, KEISHA.

39:04.367 --> 39:05.300
>> FINE.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.300
I JUST LIKE KNOWING THE RULES,

39:06.300 --> 39:07.400
SO I CAN PLAY BY THEM.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.133
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

39:08.133 --> 39:09.233
>> IF OUR EXES ARE ALLOWED

39:09.233 --> 39:10.300
IN THE PICTURE, I GUESS I'LL

39:10.300 --> 39:11.500
START HANGING OUT WITH SEAN

39:11.500 --> 39:13.567
AGAIN.

39:13.567 --> 39:15.567
>> THE HELL YOU WILL.

39:15.567 --> 39:16.767
>> SO SEAN'S A PROBLEM,

39:16.767 --> 39:18.233
AND ASHLEE ISN'T?

39:18.233 --> 39:19.700
>> THE SITUATIONS ARE COMPLETELY

39:19.700 --> 39:20.767
DIFFERENT.

39:20.767 --> 39:23.067
>> NOT TO ME.

39:23.067 --> 39:24.167
IF YOU WANT ME TO STAY AWAY

39:24.167 --> 39:26.067
FROM SEAN, DROP ASHLEE.

39:26.067 --> 39:26.833
>> YOU'RE TRIPPING WITH THESE

39:26.833 --> 39:27.967
DEMANDS HERE.

39:27.967 --> 39:29.067
NOW, LOOK, I WAS MARRIED

39:29.067 --> 39:29.833
TO ASHLEE.

39:29.833 --> 39:30.900
YOU, YOU'VE BEEN MY GIRLFRIEND

39:30.900 --> 39:33.800
FOR ALL OF FIVE MONTHS.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.167
>> OOH.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.900
WOW, IS THAT ALL I AM TO YOU?

39:37.900 --> 39:39.167
WHEN I SAID I LOVED YOU,

39:39.167 --> 39:40.400
THAT MEANT I WAS ALL IN.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.867
IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT WE'VE ONLY

39:41.867 --> 39:43.233
BEEN TOGETHER A FEW DAMN MONTHS

39:43.233 --> 39:44.067
WHEN I GOT ARRESTED FOR YOUR

39:44.067 --> 39:45.067
ASS.

39:45.067 --> 39:45.867
>> AND I APPRECIATED THAT,

39:45.867 --> 39:47.667
BUT LET US REMEMBER THAT I ALSO

39:47.667 --> 39:48.900
JUST PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO THE

39:48.900 --> 39:51.200
IRS, SO YOU COULD OVERLOOK

39:51.200 --> 39:52.067
A FEW THINGS.

39:52.067 --> 39:53.067
>> THAT'S WHAT THIS ALL COMES

39:53.067 --> 39:54.900
DOWN TO: MONEY.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.367
YOU THINK YOU BOUGHT ME?

39:56.367 --> 39:57.200
>> OR AT LEAST A LITTLE

39:57.200 --> 39:58.067
PEACE AND QUIET.

39:58.067 --> 39:59.167
>> OH.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.700
YOU GOT THE WRONG GIRL.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.233
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP ASHLEE

40:02.233 --> 40:04.500
IN CHECK WITH CASH, BUT NOT ME.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.333
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS,

40:05.333 --> 40:06.000
KEISHA.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

40:20.133 --> 40:21.167
>> GOOD-BYE.

40:21.167 --> 40:23.167
>> PEACE.

40:29.933 --> 40:32.267
>> NEXT ON SINGLE LADIES...

40:32.267 --> 40:33.800
>> RAQUEL, I CAN'T STAY HERE

40:33.800 --> 40:34.500
TONIGHT.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.767
>> JUST FOR A SEC.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.633
>> I NEED TO GET SOME MORE

40:36.633 --> 40:37.333
LISTINGS.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.667
>> THERE ARE A FEW FORECLOSURES

40:38.667 --> 40:40.600
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MOVE.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.400
>> YOU NEED A COURT ORDER

40:41.400 --> 40:42.767
TO GET ME UP OUT OF THIS PLACE.

40:42.767 --> 40:43.933
SO UNLESS YOU PLAN ON TRYING

40:43.933 --> 40:45.500
TO PHYSICALLY REMOVE ME,

40:45.500 --> 40:47.033
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

40:47.033 --> 40:48.867
>> I REALLY MISS YOU, KEISH.

40:48.867 --> 40:50.000
WE DON'T HANG OUT HALF AS MUCH

40:50.000 --> 40:50.767
AS WE USED TO.

40:50.767 --> 40:51.833
>> I TOLD APRIL I COULDN'T GO

40:51.833 --> 40:52.500
OUT.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.467
>> THEN WE'LL STAY IN.

40:54.467 --> 40:56.433
>> MALCOLM, I--

40:56.433 --> 40:59.700
MALCOLM, I--

40:59.700 --> 41:01.067
>> I'M COMING FOR YOU, KEISHA.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.300
>> WHEN IT'S RIGHT, IT'S RIGHT.

41:03.300 --> 41:06.833
OMAR, WOULD YOU PLEASE

41:06.833 --> 41:08.300
DO ME THE HONOR OF BECOMING

41:08.300 --> 41:09.133
MY HUSBAND?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.433
>> * FEEL SO FREE

41:10.433 --> 41:12.600
* DON'T NEED ANYONE TO KEEP *

41:12.600 --> 41:14.233
* MY MIND, MY BODY

41:14.233 --> 41:16.433
* MY SOUL

41:16.433 --> 41:20.833
* SINGLE

41:20.833 --> 41:22.833
* LADIES
