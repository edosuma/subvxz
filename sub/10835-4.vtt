WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.545
Previously on 90210...

00:03.671 --> 00:04.630
HARRY:
Come on, Beverly Hills is

00:04.755 --> 00:05.756
gonna be great for our family.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.341
We got the weather,
we got the palm trees

00:07.466 --> 00:08.676
with the...

00:08.801 --> 00:10.218
more palm trees.
More palm trees.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.846
You had, like,
a million friends.

00:11.971 --> 00:15.056
Back home, and they all knew
about the whole adoption story.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.224
So when
you gonna ask me out?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.559
Maybe I don't want
to ask you out.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.561
I bet you that you do.
How would you like

00:19.687 --> 00:21.355
to put down the paintbrush
and join the chorus?

00:21.480 --> 00:22.564
I would so love to.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.649
Thank you.
MAN:
You owe $200.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.442
ADRIANNA:
Well, I don't have that,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.444
but I'll get it.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.445
RYAN:
Adrianna, what's
up with you?

00:28.570 --> 00:29.697
You okay?

00:29.822 --> 00:31.949
Yeah. I'm just distracted.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.283
NAOMI:
I went to Dad's office
last night,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.828
and I saw him there
kissing another woman.

00:35.953 --> 00:36.578
I'm gonna take
you home, okay?

00:36.704 --> 00:37.788
(sniffing):
Okay.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.080
ANNIE:
This night is

00:39.206 --> 00:41.082
nothing like I
thought it would be.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.626
Is that a good thing?
(chuckles)

00:42.751 --> 00:44.127
It's a
great thing.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.379
ETHAN:
So... you like him?

00:45.504 --> 00:47.381
At the very least,
we'll be friends.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.383
Are we friends?

00:49.508 --> 00:51.050
Hey, I-I spent
the whole night

00:51.176 --> 00:53.595
making you these cookies,
so eat a snickerdoodle.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.644
(chuckles):
That's way better
than cookies.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.771
♪ ♪

01:13.824 --> 01:15.283
Don't be
scared. Just...

01:15.409 --> 01:17.327
No.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.162
Please.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.622
Don't.
Just...

01:20.748 --> 01:21.623
What?

01:21.749 --> 01:24.125
(sighs)

01:27.295 --> 01:28.505
BRENDA:
Stop! You two,

01:28.630 --> 01:30.549
hold on a sec.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.759
Silver, what
are you doing?

01:31.884 --> 01:32.760
Nothing.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.720
Paying attention.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.179
Sorry.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.305
Checking my blog.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.724
Big in Bolivia.
Who knew?

01:38.849 --> 01:39.892
All right, well,
Ty and Annie

01:40.017 --> 01:42.352
are about
to have sex on stage.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.604
Yeah, right.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.146
I know, this is, like, a high
school play.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.440
How far you planning
on taking this thing?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.233
What happened to my light,
Silver?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.443
Ask J-Rod.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.194
He's the one running
the control board.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.571
Okay, you're the
stage manager.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.740
It's your job to tell Jared
when the lights go up

01:54.865 --> 01:55.991
and when the
lights go down.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.410
This would be
when you bring the lights down.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.578
Yo, J-Rod.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.830
Lose the horny couple
center stage.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.248
(sighs)

02:06.627 --> 02:08.419
Okay, thanks, everybody.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.839
Right after dinner, we're going
to dive into the second act,

02:10.965 --> 02:13.425
but before you all run off,
I just want to say

02:13.550 --> 02:14.760
how glad I am

02:14.885 --> 02:16.219
that I came
back for this.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.806
Some of you just
put the pros to shame.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.515
And if the audience
is not standing

02:20.641 --> 02:22.017
on their feet
at the end of tomorrow night,

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
I will personally
kick their asses.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.519
(laughter, applause)

02:28.315 --> 02:30.275
Hey, Annie, thanks
for stepping

02:30.400 --> 02:32.611
out of the chorus
to understudy for Adrianna.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.656
With her gone so much,
it's been a huge help.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.074
I know it can be
a little nerve-wracking.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.785
More than happy to do it,
Ms. Walsh.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.411
Thanks.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.915
Hey, you going
to dinner break?

02:45.040 --> 02:45.916
Know what?

02:46.041 --> 02:46.917
I'm not hungry.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.586
Oh, me neither.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.923
(chuckles)

02:53.048 --> 02:54.508
Jared, what is
your problem?

02:54.633 --> 02:55.676
I'm sorry.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.302
It's a lot of pressure
up here, okay?

02:57.427 --> 02:58.345
How hard can it be?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.931
Look, lights on,
lights off, done.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.434
Great, fine, you do it.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.435
Oh, no, no.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.436
Where are you going?

03:06.561 --> 03:07.437
Somewhere I'm
appreciated.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.356
I quit.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.025
Ooh.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.860
Looks like someone needs to
work on their people skills.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.361
Yeah, no kidding.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.363
What kind of jackass quits
during dress rehearsal?

03:16.488 --> 03:20.325
This whole stage manager thing
is making me mental.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.369
Have you ever run a
light board before?

03:22.494 --> 03:23.954
Uh, no.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.956
Want me to do it?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.206
I did all of
Annie's old shows

03:27.332 --> 03:29.668
back in Kansas and
everything, so, you know...

03:29.793 --> 03:31.920
You're a little lifesaver,
you know that?

03:32.046 --> 03:32.963
(both chuckle)

03:33.088 --> 03:35.507
Yeah.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.051
I know.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.596
Mom.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.849
Mother,
why are you still in bed?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.267
Why aren't you at school?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.936
Because school let out.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.690
It's been, oh, nine hours since
I said "I love you" and "Bye."

03:51.815 --> 03:52.858
I was standing here
in the doorway.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.109
Remember?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.528
You were laying in bed,
being pathetic.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.821
(clears throat)

03:59.823 --> 04:00.699
Get... up.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.784
(sighs)

04:02.910 --> 04:03.911
We're going
to get groceries.

04:04.036 --> 04:07.539
Okay, send Penelope
with a list, Naomi.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.875
Penelope is at home
feeding her family.

04:10.000 --> 04:10.918
(sighs)

04:11.043 --> 04:13.003
Okay, then order takeout.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.839
No, it's been a week of takeout,
Mom, it's been a week of this.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.716
I'm sick of it.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.928
Oh, God, Naomi.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.430
(sighs)

04:23.555 --> 04:24.556
I'm calling Dad.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.058
No, don't do that.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.269
You know, your father has Gail
and the beach house and...

04:29.394 --> 04:31.521
I just really don't want him
seeing me like this.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.565
Maybe that's what he needs.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.944
It's his fault, and he needs
to be the one to fix it.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.946
I'm gonna tell him
what a mess you are.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.114
He really needs to be here.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.324
HARRY:
There's nobody here.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.701
"Invited dress"--
what does that mean?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.578
No audience.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.038
Brenda wants us here
for encouragement for the kids.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.456
You know,
Annie used to get us

04:49.581 --> 04:51.125
to take her to the theater
all the time.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.169
We saw every musical
that came through Kansas.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.337
Please tell me this is
nothing like Mamma Mia.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.589
Oh, I loved Mamma Mia.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.174
I saw it twice on Broadway.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.551
Broadway, Topeka Playhouse--
big difference.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.720
Yeah, this one's not
quite Mamma Mia, trust me.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.180
Well, good news.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.640
Spring Awakening
is about kids

05:06.765 --> 05:08.809
discovering their
sexuality and, you know,

05:08.934 --> 05:11.979
fighting the oppressive
morals of society in 1891,

05:12.104 --> 05:13.021
but, you know,
with rock music.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.065
I take that back.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.900
Should be a
real eye-opener.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.571
Annie!

05:21.696 --> 05:22.656
Oh... Dad.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.698
(chuckles)

05:25.617 --> 05:26.534
Hi.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.410
(coughs)

05:55.063 --> 05:56.982
You're overreacting.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.650
You didn't see
the kiss.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.194
It was...

06:00.319 --> 06:01.862
You know, and the boys
here are different

06:01.987 --> 06:03.655
than the boys
back in Kansas.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.073
I know;
I used to be one.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.326
Oh, and look how
terrible you ended up.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.994
You know, Annie could
do a whole lot worse

06:09.119 --> 06:10.495
than a guy like you.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.790
(gasps)

06:13.915 --> 06:16.626
Sometimes I ask the Lord
to take my sight away.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.128
(sighs)

06:18.253 --> 06:20.839
Harry caught Annie making out
with a boy backstage.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.049
That ought to buy

06:22.174 --> 06:24.051
the poor girl
a few weeks in therapy.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.220
Why are you two
so calm about this?

06:26.345 --> 06:28.889
Men of the theater are
bons vivants, dear.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.058
One day, they're fumbling
with your bra in the back

06:31.183 --> 06:34.393
of a '52 Chevy, and the
next, they're off to Mykonos

06:34.519 --> 06:37.898
to set up house
with a stagehand named Phillip.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.068
I think what your mother
is trying to say

06:41.193 --> 06:42.903
is that
Annie's little romance

06:43.028 --> 06:44.445
might not be that serious.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.488
HARRY:
Well, I am,

06:45.613 --> 06:46.823
I'm going
to have a talk

06:46.948 --> 06:48.116
with her when she comes home.
And I'll have

06:48.242 --> 06:50.744
the psychiatrist
standing by.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.915
Harry, you are
a wonderful father,

06:55.040 --> 06:56.291
but there are some things

06:56.415 --> 06:58.126
that are just strictly
mother-daughter.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.461
So let me talk to Annie, okay?

07:00.587 --> 07:01.420
Mm.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.800
(knocking on door)

07:05.926 --> 07:07.719
NAOMI:
Mom, I'm coming in.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.597
TRACY:
Forget buying
groceries, Naomi.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.225
I'm not cooking.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.560
How about we
eat out instead?

07:15.685 --> 07:16.561
I'm feeling

07:16.686 --> 07:18.021
like Italian.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.523
Oh, hello, Charles.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.942
Will you be joining us?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.610
Tracy.
You look great.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.153
I thought you said

07:25.279 --> 07:27.197
she couldn't get
out of bed.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.950
Well, I mean, clearly
you've inspired her.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.243
You're already
helping out, Daddy.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.577
TRACY:
Could you give
us a second,

07:32.702 --> 07:33.661
sweetheart?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.080
Oh, sure, yeah,
of course.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.124
I'll just go make
reservations at Modaio.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.250
For three?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.880
What's going on, Tracy?

07:44.005 --> 07:44.672
Well, let's...

07:44.798 --> 07:46.925
see.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.218
Last time I checked,

07:48.343 --> 07:49.844
you left your wife
and daughter

07:49.970 --> 07:52.513
for a life at the beach house
with your longtime whore.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.184
Did I leave anything out?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.770
I know you're hurting.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.897
You don't have to put
on an act, not for me.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.737
(groans)

08:07.862 --> 08:09.823
Okay.

08:12.117 --> 08:12.909
That make you feel better?

08:13.034 --> 08:15.036
Mm-hmm.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.008
Hey, honey.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.343
Hey.
There's a plate

08:29.468 --> 08:30.844
in the fridge for you;
I'll warm it up.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.011
Oh, thanks.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.097
So, Dad tell you
what happened today?

08:35.222 --> 08:36.099
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.393
I got all
the gory details.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
You want to talk about it?
(chuckles)

08:40.227 --> 08:42.605
No, I, uh,
would rather hit myself

08:42.730 --> 08:44.732
repeatedly with a hammer.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.861
I notice you've been spending
a lot of time with Ty.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.572
Yeah, but it's not
just a play thing, Mom.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.117
I like Ty. A lot.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.619
You said the same thing about
Jason in The King and I.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.873
Yeah, well, Jason was big

08:59.998 --> 09:02.125
and sweet and Kansas.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.836
Ty is tall and skinny

09:04.961 --> 09:06.754
and cool,
and he's got these ears

09:06.880 --> 09:08.215
that stick out
like little elves'.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.341
(chuckles)

09:09.466 --> 09:11.051
Can I be your mom for a second?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.552
Oh, no, no, no.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.223
Mom, Mom, please do not
turn this into a sex talk.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.265
Okay, today has been
humiliating enough.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.641
But if you
are thinking

09:18.766 --> 09:21.769
about it,
or if he's pressuring you

09:21.895 --> 09:23.855
or you're confused,

09:23.980 --> 09:25.982
you know it's okay
to wait, right?

09:26.107 --> 09:27.901
Yeah, I-I know
the consequences, Mom.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.069
(chuckles)

09:29.194 --> 09:30.778
The emotional consequences, too?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.864
Like what if he doesn't call
or he doesn't say hi

09:32.989 --> 09:33.907
to you at school,

09:34.032 --> 09:34.908
or worse, he tells

09:35.033 --> 09:36.159
all of his friends?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.577
Ty is nothing like that.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.746
Okay.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.081
(microwave beeps)

09:41.206 --> 09:42.416
I trust your judgment.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.919
So...

09:46.044 --> 09:47.212
Dad's going to forget

09:47.337 --> 09:49.214
what he saw today, right?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.882
(chuckles):
Oh, no.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.259
That's never going to happen.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.055
♪ ♪

10:06.856 --> 10:07.982
You're late, Adrianna.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.484
Again.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.945
By the looks of things,
so is everyone else.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.821
Actually, everyone else
is backstage

10:13.947 --> 10:15.115
getting fitted for the show.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.285
Look, I get it.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.412
I've been distracted lately,

10:20.537 --> 10:23.248
maybe I've missed a
couple of rehearsals,

10:23.373 --> 10:25.041
but let's just be honest.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.127
This is just a high school play.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.003
I was on
television.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.047
I was in movies.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.383
Yeah, well, that's all
great stuff for the program,

10:33.508 --> 10:35.176
but I'm worried
about you right now.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.095
Don't be. I'm fine.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.097
I'm on your side;
you can talk to me.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.348
And tell you what?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.976
That I woke up at 5:00
this morning,

10:43.101 --> 10:45.937
all so I could meet a trainer
that my mom can't afford.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.855
That the reason I'm
late is 'cause I went

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
to a commercial audition
that I'm not gonna get

10:50.275 --> 10:52.819
because I'm too fat,
too brunette or too old.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.279
And then
there's this.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.239
And there's you, and
there's the voices

10:56.364 --> 10:58.158
in my head that
keep telling me

10:58.283 --> 10:59.826
that I'm not trying
hard enough.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.663
Okay.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.333
I cannot change
what happens out there,

11:06.458 --> 11:09.085
but we can change
what happens here.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.296
I care about you,

11:11.421 --> 11:13.423
I care about this play,

11:13.548 --> 11:15.425
and I think you can be good.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.760
I am good.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.012
(chuckles)

11:19.137 --> 11:20.763
And I love a girl
with confidence.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.477
(sniffles)

11:26.520 --> 11:28.146

And told my mom,
who then turned it

12:12.691 --> 12:14.526
into an after school special
sex talk.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.277
What's an after school special?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.487
(laughs):
Google it.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.197
Oh, hello, Annie.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.407
Silver.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.242
Your Highness.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.035
What are we chatting about
today, ladies?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.579
Well, if you must know,

12:25.704 --> 12:27.788
Annie's dad caught her
and Ty Collins

12:27.914 --> 12:29.999
in a backstage lip-lock.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.251
Nice work, new girl.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.127
Haven't you only been here,
like, a month?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.295
You're already bagging

12:34.421 --> 12:35.505
one of the hottest guys
at school?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.298
No one is bagging anyone.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.799
It was just a kiss.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.468
Oh, whatever.
With a guy like Ty,

12:40.594 --> 12:41.928
it's only a matter of time.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.347
He's had everybody,
and it looks like you're next.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.891
I am not having sex
with Ty Collins.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.560
Why not?
You're friends, right?

12:48.685 --> 12:49.436
You should explore
the benefits.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.478
(laughs)

12:50.604 --> 12:51.854
Uh, yeah, it's just that

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
not everybody's a ho-bot
like you, Naomi.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.815
(laughter)

12:54.941 --> 12:56.317
Very good, Silver.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.194
What is this,
the last virgin wins?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.778
If Annie
wants to wait

12:59.904 --> 13:01.114
for the right guy,
I think she should.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.074
Thank you.
Whatever.
Everyone makes sex

13:03.199 --> 13:04.242
a big humongous deal.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.535
Ethan and I didn't wait.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.662
I mean, we practically
did it instantly.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.038
Doesn't everyone want
what Ethan and I have?

13:09.163 --> 13:10.123
(laughs)

13:10.248 --> 13:11.291
Oh, hi, baby.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.292
We were just
talking about you.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.460
(kisses):
Mm!

13:13.585 --> 13:14.711
Hey, Annie, good luck in

13:14.835 --> 13:16.087
the show tonight;
we'll be watching.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.505
You guys are actually
coming tonight?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.839
Oh, yeah.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.925
Well, maybe to
the after party.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.801
Break a leg.
Thanks.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.513
So, you're going to give me
a piggyback ride to class.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.014
Again?
Mm-hmm.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.349
(giggles)

13:28.475 --> 13:30.602
(both giggling)

13:30.727 --> 13:33.104
They do seem happy,
don't they?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.982
Yeah, you are not ready
for sex.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.234
See you later.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.903
(sighs)

13:41.028 --> 13:42.530
Hello, ladies.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.616
Hey, you have a minute?

13:44.741 --> 13:46.993
I have exactly a minute
before the students descend.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.161
What's up?

13:48.286 --> 13:51.038
Uh, Brenda is worried
about Adrianna.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.040
With reason,
probably.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.376
She's been distant,
distracted in class.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.919
What's she like
in rehearsal?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.088
She's amazing.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.091
Uh, incredible instincts,
fantastic voice.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.010
But?

14:04.135 --> 14:07.597
But, like you said,
a little...

14:07.722 --> 14:08.556
a little distant
and distracted.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.975
Though, in her defense,

14:11.100 --> 14:12.602
she's under intense pressure

14:12.727 --> 14:14.437
from pretty much every angle
in her life.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.272
You think she's using?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.607
I don't know.
I don't think so.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.108
It's a possibility, though.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.362
We should pull her
from the play.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.988
No, Kelly.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.449
You just said she's
under intense pressure...

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
Yeah, and the play, I think,
is the only thing

14:29.118 --> 14:30.244
keeping her off the ledge.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.038
Look, I can handle this,
all right?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.956
She trusts me.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.249
I just don't know if this play

14:35.375 --> 14:36.835
is the best thing
for her right now.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.212
The tricky part of teaching
is being friendly

14:39.337 --> 14:41.422
without becoming their friend.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.424
I got this. Please?

14:45.468 --> 14:47.470
TY:
Forgive me.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.431
It was me, all me.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.932
I can hear your
heart beat, Wendla.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.477
Oh, Melchi.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.979
Uh, I, um...

14:57.104 --> 14:59.524
I suddenly feel-- ugh.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.693
Let's take a break, okay?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.319
Are you okay?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.612
Yeah, yeah. No.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.613
(laughs)

15:05.739 --> 15:07.574
No! I don't know.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.826
I barely got any sleep
last night.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.160
You know, pre-show
jitters, I think.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.746
Yeah.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.414
And now, I suddenly
feel nauseous, and...

15:14.539 --> 15:15.665
(groans)
Don't you?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.041
I mean, you're the lead.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.626
I'm just in the chorus.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.294
Well, you also
understudy Adrianna.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.004
(sighs)
You know all
her lines.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.757
Mine, too, probably.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.466
You're just psyching
yourself out.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.551
God, I hope you're right.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.846
Trust me.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.056
So, are you going to The
Roosevelt after the show?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.349
Oh, for sure.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.142
Naomi said
it's fantastic.
Yeah.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.772
You know, a huge pool,
swanky deck chairs everywhere.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.481
Celebrities lounging
here and there.
Ah.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.108
And there
and there.
I booked us a room.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.359
You booked us a room?

15:43.484 --> 15:44.402
Right.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.612
For us?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.363
Only if you want to. I...

15:47.488 --> 15:49.198
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.408
Uh, why wouldn't I?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.034
Relax.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.036
It's gonna be a great
night. You'll see.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.955
Yeah.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.504
Annie barely said
a word at dinner.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.172
What do you expect?
She's nervous.
Yeah, well,

16:05.298 --> 16:06.466
she never
used to get this way

16:06.591 --> 16:07.717
before shows in Kansas.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.677
Well, that was then,
this is California.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.178
You know, hon,
don't you feel like

16:11.304 --> 16:13.431
The Roosevelt Hotel is
a little fancy

16:13.556 --> 16:14.641
for an after party?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.768
I mean, isn't the whole
spirit of theatre about

16:16.893 --> 16:19.395
camaraderie in the face
of starvation and poverty?

16:19.520 --> 16:22.148
Harry, we have
to let her go.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.776
No, no, we don't
have to let her go.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.528
Huh, no-- legally,
she has to do what we say

16:27.654 --> 16:29.405
until she is 18.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
Right, and then spends the rest
of her life resenting us.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.868
It is a hotel. Right?

16:33.993 --> 16:37.580
With rooms and beds
and horny teenage boys.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.499
Annie is a smart girl.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.250
She makes intelligent
decisions.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.878
Yes, I know that
she is a smart girl,

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
but she is no match
for the young male libido.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.549
You can't put your
experiences on Annie.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.135
No! No, not my experiences.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.137
My mistakes.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.390
I have a son running around
out there somewhere

16:56.516 --> 16:58.184
because of a mistake that I made

16:58.309 --> 16:59.560
when I was a teenager.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.354
That's your regret, Harry.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.481
You can't let that stop Annie
from living.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.191
All we can do is

17:05.316 --> 17:07.193
guide her to a path, and then,

17:07.318 --> 17:09.236
whatever path she chooses,
that's her decision.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.279
Mom?

17:10.404 --> 17:13.156
Oh. Wow.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.742
Uh, can I get a ride to school?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.996
There's a vocal warm-up at 6:30.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.914
Okay, uh, just, uh,
let me get my keys.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.023
I have been texting you
all afternoon.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.776
Um, I have been here
rehearsing with Brenda.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.444
Hi. I'm Brenda Walsh,
the play's director.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.447
Your daughter
has an amazing talent.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.534
Yes, I'm very, very proud
of her. Sweetheart...

17:56.659 --> 17:57.994
Mom, it was
so amazing.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.788
We went over and over
everything, the entire play,

18:00.914 --> 18:02.206
and my voice sounds fine.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.624
It's great.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.543
Good, because you have
three agents coming.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.712
There's agents?
Mm-hmm.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.089
And two producers, and I am
seating them stage left,

18:10.214 --> 18:12.550
so if you can remember--
cheat your songs left.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.176
That's great, Mom.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.303
You're going to be amazing.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.390
All you have to do is
kill in this performance,

18:19.515 --> 18:21.642
and you'll start
working again, and then,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.561
we'll both be fine.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.480
Nice to have
met you.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.316
Mm-hmm.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.531
Annie, wait a second.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.742
Dad, I'm really late, and
Ms. Walsh is gonna kill me,

18:37.867 --> 18:39.994
and I'm all kinds of nerves,
and the more I talk...

18:40.119 --> 18:41.412
We have to talk
about what happened

18:41.537 --> 18:42.580
the other day
with that boy.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.749
His name is Ty, Dad.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.584
And he's your boyfriend?

18:46.709 --> 18:47.835
It's possible, okay?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.503
I'm really, really late.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.838
It's just, with
rehearsal and everything,

18:50.964 --> 18:52.381
you haven't had time
to bring him by.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.633
Ty...

18:53.758 --> 18:55.760
Ty... by the house.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.470
You want to spend time
with Ty?

18:57.595 --> 18:58.763
Well, yeah.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.473
I got a great idea.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.100
Uh, why don't we all
go out after the play?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.935
Like, well, like we
did back inn Kansas.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.896
You, me, Ty, Mom,
Grandma, the whole family.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.189
Awesome, except you know

19:09.315 --> 19:11.358
I'm going to the party
at The Roosevelt.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.444
Well, The Roosevelt has
a restaurant, doesn't it?

19:13.569 --> 19:14.821
Oh, Dad, stop, okay?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.572
I know what you're doing.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.657
What am I doing?

19:17.782 --> 19:18.825
You don't trust me.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.285
No, I do, I do trust you.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.996
Then why are we talking?

19:23.121 --> 19:26.499
Because I do not want
you to make a mistake.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.294
And when it comes to sex...

19:30.419 --> 19:33.213
No... no, I am not having
this conversation.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.548
I'll be inside.
No!

19:34.674 --> 19:35.758
Hey-hey, Annie...

19:35.883 --> 19:38.469
Dad, you either trust me,
or you don't,

19:38.594 --> 19:41.055
and it's really sounding
like you don't.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.110
Nope. No Adrianna.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.112
Where is she?
Have you tried her cell?

19:56.236 --> 19:57.655
DIXON:
Um, Silver,
about the light...

19:57.780 --> 19:58.823
Dixon, not now.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.366
I called her--
it's off.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.035
Texts ignored.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.954
Witness her makeup
corner-- untouched.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.747
Look, I scoured
the halls.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.541
She's AWOL.
Again.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.543
All right, Silver, you're
the stage manger.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.545
What are you
going to do?

20:12.670 --> 20:15.548
Has anybody seen Adrianna?

20:15.673 --> 20:17.591
ADRIANNA:
Ugh, I'm right here,

20:17.717 --> 20:19.468
freak show.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.345
Calm down.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.515
Adrianna...

20:24.640 --> 20:26.767
Mm-hmm?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.603
What's wrong with you?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.899
Oh, um,

20:33.024 --> 20:35.109
I just ran out to get
some cough medicine.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.819
Ugh, all this singing,
it's just,

20:36.944 --> 20:39.238
like, ripped my throat.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.783
(giggles)

20:45.786 --> 20:47.747
Chill.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.707
I'm here, and I'm ready to rock.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.543
Whoo!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.045
(giggles)

20:54.170 --> 20:56.547
You can't go out there
like this.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.465
Of course I can.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.095
Annie, you're up.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.055
You can't do that!

21:04.180 --> 21:05.973
BRENDA:
Change out of that costume,
put on Adrianna's.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.683
Curtain is in-- Silver?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.561
Frickin'... 15 minutes.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.107
Um... okay.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.410
I know it's just
a puny little high school play,

21:26.535 --> 21:28.204
but you're gonna be
blown away by Adrianna.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.123
Oh, she'll be
so excited you're here.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.749
Thank you so much.
Get settled.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.417
I'm gonna check on her
backstage.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.501
HARRY:
...but you know.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.544
DEBBIE:
I know.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.004
What did you argue
with her about?

21:37.130 --> 21:38.089
No, see, it wasn't
an argument,

21:38.214 --> 21:39.548
it was a civil
conversation.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.050
Yes, until it turned.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.802
Harry, tonight is
a big night for Annie.

21:42.927 --> 21:43.970
Yes.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.387
Absolutely right.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.431
And I have to pull back.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.018
And trust that she will
do the right thing.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.436
Okay, I'm gonna have
my script open

21:52.561 --> 21:54.063
and in front of me
during the whole play.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.773
Forget a line,
look backstage.

21:55.898 --> 21:56.941
I'll just shoot it
to you.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.859
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.569
Just breathe.
I am breathing.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.113
Breathe slower.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.614
Romeo to the rescue.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.657
Melchior.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.908
Whatever. Hey.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.785
Uh, can you please just
help me deal with this?

22:07.910 --> 22:10.537
I have to go deal with
something else backstage.
All right.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.372
SILVER:
Dixon, I need
you-- now.
Annie...

22:12.498 --> 22:14.374
(shuddering)
Just relax.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.709
You're gonna be great.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.503
Oh, keep doing that.
That feels good.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.921
That helps a lot.
Okay.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.047
Five minutes!

22:20.173 --> 22:21.381
Five minute to call, people!

22:21.507 --> 22:23.050
Oh. I better go.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.178
Hey, remember,

22:25.303 --> 22:27.180
when you're out there,
just look at me.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.182
When we're on stage,
there's nobody else.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.184
Just you and me. Okay?
Mm-hmm.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.060
All right, you're
gonna be great.
Okay.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.061
DIXON:
Coming through--
looking for Silver.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.062
Hey-- Oh, sorry, man.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.939
You okay?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.150
Define "okay."
No time.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.152
Just don't mess this
up, all right?

22:41.277 --> 22:42.653
Your sister's
counting on you.

in the play.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.146
I talked to her.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.856
And she's worried about you.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.858

be using drugs.

take something?

24:09.031 --> 24:10.908
Mom, I didn't take anything.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.910
You know all I see?

24:13.035 --> 24:15.495
I see a little girl

24:15.621 --> 24:17.123

What are you doing
with it?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.253
Giving it
to the Malibu Mission.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.963
So, one day soon,

25:48.088 --> 25:49.965
your father will step out
of his beach house

25:50.090 --> 25:52.968
and see a homeless man
wearing his tailor-fit Armani,

25:53.093 --> 25:55.721
and he will think of me.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.931
I thought you guys were
getting back together.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.100
Back together?

26:00.226 --> 26:03.103
Naomi, your father
and I are divorcing.

26:05.605 --> 26:08.025
ANNIE:
I was lying by
the stream,

26:08.150 --> 26:09.318
and then I saw
you here.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.568
TY:
Yes.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.656
So...

26:14.781 --> 26:16.658
So...

26:16.783 --> 26:19.745
The stream.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.830
Dreaming again?

26:21.955 --> 26:23.874
I was, I guess.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.668
TY:
Tell me.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.586
It's silly.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.305
And I can't remember
the last time

26:38.431 --> 26:40.640
your father and I could talk
without fighting.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.227
So I asked him to make a choice.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.146
Me or Gail.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.606
And what did he say?

26:48.732 --> 26:51.777
Well, he said
that he couldn't decide.

26:51.902 --> 26:55.406
So, I'm making the decision
for him.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.616
And... this is supposed
to get him to come home?

26:59.910 --> 27:02.204
I have to respect myself.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.082
And more importantly,
I need you to respect me.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.668
And please...

27:08.794 --> 27:09.920
don't tell me you do.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.340
So, this is it.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.008
Yeah.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.260
This is it.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.972
But...

27:20.097 --> 27:21.765
we're gonna be okay.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.018
How?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.520
I was kind of hoping

27:26.644 --> 27:29.022
you would have an answer
for that one.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.399
Normally would.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.401
Come here.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.320
I love you.

27:34.445 --> 27:37.114
(applause and cheering)

27:39.366 --> 27:41.785
Whoo!

Go. Go.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.046

28:34.171 --> 28:36.131
Yo, the audience ate up
everything you gave 'em.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.383
Thanks.

28:37.508 --> 28:38.384
And Silver, you know,

28:38.509 --> 28:40.636
she's a big pot of mean.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.390
Just big... seething,
hot pot of mean.

28:44.515 --> 28:45.307
Yeah, can I see your wallet?

28:45.432 --> 28:46.725
Uh... yeah.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.352
I mean I only got,
like, $11 or whatever,

28:48.477 --> 28:49.395

28:49.520 --> 28:50.854
No, I need your condom.

Whoa, uh, run that

28:55.484 --> 28:56.402
I need it.
Whoa, whoa.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.779
Uh, let's never
speak of it.
Yeah.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.157

29:44.283 --> 29:45.743
Oh!
Ethan.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.119
Uh...
Hey, uh, I brought
you flowers.

No.

I know.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.232
I know.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.525
By some girl.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.819
Some girl who was not Naomi.

save yourself

30:32.539 --> 30:34.249
I tried that.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.335
Didn't work out.

to be in high school.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.984
You know, the pressure
on these kids...

37:28.997 --> 37:31.958
You're being
bossy again.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.543
But I like it.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.711
Come here.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.755
(both laughing)

37:45.680 --> 37:47.390
All right.
Oh, I wouldn't
move that one.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.059
Oh, I think that...

37:49.184 --> 37:51.103
DEBBIE:
Annie, you're home early.

37:51.228 --> 37:54.064
Yeah, the party
was really loud,

37:54.189 --> 37:55.732
and I didn't realize
how tired I was

37:55.857 --> 37:56.942
after the play and everything,

37:57.067 --> 37:58.985
so I... I just want
to go to bed.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.195
Welcome home.

38:00.319 --> 38:02.781
You... you were
really great tonight.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.908
Thanks.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.618
We're proud of you.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.287
Good night.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.665
Good night.
