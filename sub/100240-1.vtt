WILL:
How are you feeling physically?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.127
LUCY: I'm in top shape, sir.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.964
WILL: After just a few days
in micro-gravity

08:52.966 --> 08:56.067
your bone and muscle mass
begins to shrink dramatically.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.536
You were up ten days.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.673
I've seen men
carried off the shuttle,

09:01.675 --> 09:03.041
too weak to stand.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.809
LUCY: Well...

09:10.317 --> 09:11.750
All right.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.719
Top of your class,
naval academy.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.556
Valedictorian,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.692

09:20.694 --> 09:21.927
Stop what?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.963
-WILL: Working.
-I'm taking a few days.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.666
My niece is staying with us.
Blue Iris.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.267
WILL: Blue Iris?

09:29.269 --> 09:32.137
It was his second choice,
actually. My brother.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.740
His wife talked him out
of Sanctuary Rose.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.910
Annabelle,
she was the practical one.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.912
Change a light bulb.
Remember to eat.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.348
She's dead now.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.284
Anyway...

09:46.954 --> 09:48.787
Iris is staying with us,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.689

girl things.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.224
WILL: Didn't I see you here
on the track yesterday,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.893
and in the gym this morning?

09:55.228 --> 09:58.096
LUCY: Bone density.
Muscle mass.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.098
WILL: Throw a Frisbee.
Fly a kite.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.000
-(Lucy laughs)
-WILL: What?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.837
Nana says
Frisbees are for dogs.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.841
WILL: Tell me about her.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.713
Three guys chased my dad home
from school one day

10:14.715 --> 10:15.780
with axe handles

10:15.782 --> 10:18.149
and she put the first
warning shot in the dirt.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.885
-The first?
-Lucy: Well, in San Angelo

10:20.887 --> 10:23.121
a leg shot's considered
a warning.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.726
Why'd they chase him?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.362
Your dad.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.264
LUCY: He pissed
in their gas tank.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.738
You know Michael Collins?

10:40.340 --> 10:43.041
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Apollo 11.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.976
He flew the command module
for Neil and Buzz.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.829
WILL: Yeah.

10:47.830 --> 10:48.846
So you know that
after he dropped them...

10:49.216 --> 10:52.283
he circled the moon for hours.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.689
It's farther from Earth
than any man has ever been.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.893
<i> No light, no radio.</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:08.299
And he wept,
consumed by darkness

11:08.301 --> 11:10.935
and then,
when he saw the sun again...

11:11.705 --> 11:12.904
he wept some more.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.809
Inside the module he wrote...

11:19.212 --> 11:21.012
"I am now truly alone...

11:22.249 --> 11:26.418
and absolutely alone
from any known life.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.852
I am it. "

11:41.001 --> 11:42.267
I'm fine.

11:47.107 --> 11:53.778

(door closes)

12:33.754 --> 12:35.453
LUCY: There are better ways
to kill yourself

12:35.455 --> 12:38.189
than smoking
with your oxygen machine.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.892
How's that, fucker?

12:42.496 --> 12:43.795
I'm back.

12:43.797 --> 12:48.166
-Ooh. Did you go somewhere?
-Well, up, then down.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.101
(chuckles)

12:50.837 --> 12:53.338
You show those
Ivy League assholes

12:53.340 --> 12:56.074
-how it's done?
-Damn straight.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.781
(sighs) Your father
used to play golf.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.017
Said it was good for business.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.153
He was unemployed.

13:08.855 --> 13:09.921
He was an idiot.

13:18.098 --> 13:21.366
You here to make sure
I'm still breathing?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.269
Drew said your disposal's out.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.904
Oh.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.305
That it is.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.509
LUCY:<i> I'm supposed to be</i>

13:32.846 --> 13:35.079
I've already color coded
three rooms in my house

13:35.248 --> 13:37.015
and signed up
for neighborhood watch.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.851
NANA: You should get a hobby,

13:40.153 --> 13:42.453

-LUCY: Drinking's not a hobby.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.123
(chuckles) Well,
the government says

13:45.125 --> 13:47.592
I'm too old
to do it professionally.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.562
LUCY: Fixed.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.133
NANA: They givin' you a medal?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.602
NASA? For what?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.604
All I did was my job.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.508
Good girl.
No special treatment.

14:06.246 --> 14:11.182
Sebastian dropped Iris on us
again while I was in space.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.184
Can you believe that?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.254
Did you leave her in the car?

14:16.556 --> 14:17.989
She's in school.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.060
He called me from the road,
your brother.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.464
Something about
power tool races

14:26.466 --> 14:28.333
in San Francisco.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.469
You know what I told him?
"Get a job."

14:31.972 --> 14:33.204
LUCY: Oh, he has a job.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.206
He writes poetry.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.978
When's your next mission?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.248
<i> Polaris</i> goes in a few weeks.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.650
Orion is in 13 months.
That's my shot.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.353
NANA: Well, you're not getting
any younger.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.458
So, you're just gonna
have to work harder.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.637
(pants)

15:17.350 --> 15:20.285
Suit circuit return valve.
Reverse O-two umbilicals. Check.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.053

ERIN: Watch it.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.682
Relax. You'll run faster.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.384
Loose, you know?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.720
No hurry. Just let it go.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.152
-ALL: Good morning.
-JIM: There you go.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.557
If you are in this room
and you are wearing blue

16:32.559 --> 16:35.626
you are a candidate
for the next Orion mission.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.231
Mission parameters are fluid...

16:41.334 --> 16:42.567
but for now...

16:43.370 --> 16:45.470
let's plan on a two-week run.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.440
We'll be installing
a starboard truss system

16:49.442 --> 16:52.744
-and a solar array pair.
-I saw you on the track today.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.047
ERIN: Mm-hmm.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.615
LUCY: You need to keep
your head up.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.720
JIM: Some of you
have taken this ride before.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.689
Congratulations.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.494
Now, the bad news.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.295
If you wanna go again...

17:12.298 --> 17:13.598
Thanks for the tip.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.400
...you're gonna have to earn it.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.036
And that's no joke.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.272
Dismissed.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.176
ERIN: You were
on the Destiny mission, right?

17:25.178 --> 17:29.347
-I was. Tell me your name again?
-I'm Erin Eccles.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.482
-I just came over from the SAIL.
-Wow.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.652
So, do you have any pointers?
Other than keep my chin up.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.188
Oh, that depends.
Are you a pilot?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.623
I'm in robotics.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.525
Well, scratch two seats
right there.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.062
So, you want that seat
on Orion? You take it.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.098
Just make sure to leave
one for me. All right?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.699
Copy that.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.771

Hard restart.

-MARK: Eccles?
-Give me a second.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.853

a second, rookie.

Mission accomplished, sir.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.785
That's not what I asked.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.954
Best two weeks of my life.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.785
Chelsea, Emily,
this is Daddy's friend, Lucy.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.621
Lucy was just in space
last week.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.056
Maybe y'all have some questions
for her?

22:05.058 --> 22:06.457
Um...

22:06.793 --> 22:08.559
Where'd you get that brownie?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.094
(Lucy chuckles)

22:10.563 --> 22:12.830
Over there.
And they're very good.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.803
Yeah, okay. Here. Go.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.605
Don't tell your mother
I gave you that.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.743
Separated. It's a lot of work.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.778
Well, they seem like great kids.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.846
They are.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.381
Hey, you bowl?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.116
-What?
-Bowling.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.486
Indigenous cultural praxis
of the North Americas.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.022
Promotes social cohesion

22:38.758 --> 22:40.891

alcohol abuse,

No. The club.
You're a member now.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.576
What club?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.613
The most elite group
of people ever formed

23:02.615 --> 23:04.682
in the history of mankind.
A secret society

23:04.684 --> 23:07.852
where every single member
has seen the face of God.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.088
The one... the only...

23:41.154 --> 23:42.787
No. Just tell him
you're training.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.054
That's what the rest of us do.

23:46.025 --> 23:49.827
Sugarland Lanes, eight o'clock.
Ask for Wernher von Braun.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.896

-Hey, girls, let's go.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.931
Let's see if we can eat

Hi.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.597
What you doing for lunch?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.167
Uh. Wow.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.137
Well...

34:02.808 --> 34:05.208
I brought a sack lunch.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.210
Now, I know it's...

34:08.680 --> 34:12.182
late notice but I could see
if the maître d' can find us

34:12.184 --> 34:13.650
a table for two somewhere.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.353
Uh...

34:19.191 --> 34:21.625
Sure, sure. All right.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.395

34:41.680 --> 34:43.313
LUCY: You do this every day?

34:43.615 --> 34:46.249

I<i> do</i> do work.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.751
-LUCY: I'm not sure about that.
-You know, right?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.553

-LUCY: I question.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.855

Yeah, they're all right.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.665
I mean,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.134
But things did get...

35:05.804 --> 35:07.604
Things were different after I...

35:08.507 --> 35:09.739
came back.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.810
Marriage-wise.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.747
Tricky.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.288
I saw my house from space.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.259
Not literally.
But... my life.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.463
Drunk mother, deadbeat father.

-What's wrong with you?

35:54.620 --> 35:57.254

we're back in high school

35:57.256 --> 36:00.590
-smoking under the bleachers.
-(mark laughs)

36:01.260 --> 36:02.626
Oh, come on, now.

under any bleachers.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.298
LUCY: Says you.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.801
Look at you. Straight arrow.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.805
You've never done
a thing wrong in your life.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.641
I've done plenty
of things wrong.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.543

36:19.912 --> 36:23.480

-Look, Mr. Know-it-all...
-(Mark sniffles)

36:32.691 --> 36:36.793

I can't smoke in the house.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.078
DREW: That's me.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.580
Apparently, you invited
your grandmother to dinner.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.950
Oh, shit. Yes, I did.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:21.626 --> 39:25.061
I'm going outside to smoke,
like a hobo.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.997
Oh. Be a doll, will you?

39:27.999 --> 39:29.866
I left 'em in my purse
in the hall.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.501

40:18.984 --> 40:21.584
So, what's the scoop?

40:22.020 --> 40:24.554
No scoop.
Just school in the summer.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.123
-Summer school.
-Hey, how was work today?

40:27.726 --> 40:30.126
-Oh, you know, same old.
-NANA: Where's your dad?

40:30.128 --> 40:32.896
-IRIS: Who knows?
-NANA: I wish I could tell ya

40:32.898 --> 40:34.531
that when he was a baby

40:34.533 --> 40:37.066
I dropped him
on his head a lot, but...

40:37.702 --> 40:41.037
fact is, some people
are just born lazy.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.975
You keep your eye on this one.
She'll show you how it's done.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.545
-You hear me?
-Yes, ma'am.

-LUCY: I don't know.

43:36.281 --> 43:37.347
Maybe.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.783
We forget...

43:41.353 --> 43:42.785
this happens.

43:45.156 --> 43:48.091
Every day, twice a day.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.029
The planet, our planet,
goes around the Sun.

43:53.999 --> 43:55.264
Can you feel it?

43:56.001 --> 43:57.200
We're moving.

44:00.005 --> 44:02.022
It's all moving.

44:02.023 --> 44:04.040
Giant objects in space,
millions of miles apart.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.010
And we forget.

44:08.046 --> 44:09.812
I mean, how is that possible?

44:11.750 --> 44:13.082
We get busy.

44:14.185 --> 44:15.852
We forget to look up.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.255
When you're up there
on the station...

44:20.058 --> 44:22.325
the sun rises every 90 minutes.

44:23.161 --> 44:27.864

44:29.267 --> 44:30.833
LUCY: Is that what it is?

44:32.137 --> 44:33.336
I don't know.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.012
You know why I pray?

44:46.217 --> 44:49.118
See, my wife straps herself
to a giant bomb...

44:50.121 --> 44:51.354
so she can leave the planet

44:51.356 --> 44:53.122
and go to a place with no air
or water.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.824
And I want her to come home.

44:56.194 --> 44:58.127
-So, I pray.
-I'm home.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.368

53:01.779 --> 53:03.612
Some people are sleepers.

53:04.582 --> 53:06.348
All they do is dream.

53:07.919 --> 53:10.286
He was always like this,
your dad.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.922
Gettin' lost, forgetting things.

53:13.691 --> 53:14.790
Me.

53:14.792 --> 53:19.261
Nana would be at work,
and he'd be in charge...

53:19.830 --> 53:21.864
but I'd be the one putting out
the toaster fire

53:21.866 --> 53:24.433
and making sure that
he was brushin' his teeth.

53:25.203 --> 53:27.303
I was nine. He was 15.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.574
They can do that, boys.

53:32.577 --> 53:34.977
They make the mess.
We're the ones who clean it up.

53:34.979 --> 53:36.545
It's not fair.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.381
Oh, no. It's not.

53:40.851 --> 53:42.451
But we can do...

53:43.721 --> 53:45.454
something they can't.

53:46.724 --> 53:47.790
What?

53:48.960 --> 53:50.226
Change.

54:09.547 --> 54:11.680
(indistinct announcements
over PA)

54:29.300 --> 54:30.733
Check out this footage.

54:40.478 --> 54:43.679
She held her breath upside down
for over two minutes.

54:45.549 --> 54:47.416
Heart rate never went above
a 100.

54:47.551 --> 54:48.751
The whole time.

54:48.753 --> 54:53.055
In fact, the longer it went,
the calmer she got.

54:54.358 --> 54:56.425

56:16.941 --> 56:19.875

56:19.877 --> 56:21.477
-WOMAN: Sure.
-Thank you.

56:22.780 --> 56:24.680
Well, this is nice. Hmm?

56:29.053 --> 56:31.086

-It is.

56:31.589 --> 56:33.122
-Well, should we?
-No.

56:33.124 --> 56:34.790
No. She's--

56:34.925 --> 56:37.025
-I'm sure she's fine. Don't.
-DREW: I'm just gonna--

56:38.095 --> 56:40.496

56:40.831 --> 56:43.999
-Uh, I'm meeting someone.
-(chuckles) Oh, no.

56:44.135 --> 56:46.535
I'm Lucy Cola's husband.
I work for NASA PR.

56:46.704 --> 56:49.138
-Drew Cola.
-ERIN: Oh. Hey.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.673
DREW: You know,
we were wondering
if you might join us.

56:52.109 --> 56:53.776
Oh. Um...

56:54.445 --> 56:55.611
Thank you.

56:55.613 --> 56:57.413
ERIN: I am actually
meeting someone.

56:57.615 --> 56:59.148
Well, just until they get here.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.083
Just a drink, come on.
We're family.

57:01.652 --> 57:04.553
-Okay. Okay.
-Great.

57:08.426 --> 57:10.492
-ERIN: Hi.
-LUCY: It wasn't my idea.

57:10.494 --> 57:11.693
(all laughing)

57:11.962 --> 57:13.195
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

57:13.197 --> 57:17.099
DREW:<i> Well, your personnel file</i>

57:17.501 --> 57:20.169

-Well, that's my job.

57:20.171 --> 57:21.870
If I don't know you,
I can't promote you.

57:21.872 --> 57:25.107
(chuckles) Um. Well, yeah.
My mom, she was a diplomat.

57:25.109 --> 57:27.142
And so we lived in New Delhi
for a few years.

57:27.711 --> 57:29.511
And then we lived in London.

57:29.513 --> 57:31.180
Then we moved to Germany
for high school.

57:35.052 --> 57:36.652
Oh! (chuckles)

57:40.157 --> 57:41.757
No? Okay.

57:42.893 --> 57:44.460
DREW: Mm.

57:44.962 --> 57:46.995
And you went to MIT.

57:48.766 --> 57:49.998
ERIN: Yeah. I--

57:50.768 --> 57:53.502
-Is this a job interview?
-(Drew chuckles)

57:54.205 --> 57:58.073
Um. Why don't you guys tell me
something about you?

57:58.476 --> 57:59.708
How long have you been married?

58:00.478 --> 58:03.178
Well, it'll be six years
next month.

58:03.547 --> 58:06.014
I was in the navy.
I got recruited by NASA.

58:06.016 --> 58:08.150
And then we met
in the cafeteria.

58:08.719 --> 58:10.102
ERIN: Romantic.

58:10.103 --> 58:11.486
Yeah. She helped me open
a bottle of ketchup.

58:11.689 --> 58:14.156
-I have weak hands.
-(Eric chuckles)

58:14.658 --> 58:16.124
ERIN: I had a boyfriend
in Boston,

58:16.126 --> 58:18.927
but he was competitive. And...

58:19.563 --> 58:20.963
I don't lose, so...

58:22.533 --> 58:24.199
Didn't work out. (chuckles)

58:25.736 --> 58:27.536
DREW: Mark! Hey, Mark!

58:28.239 --> 58:29.938

58:30.608 --> 58:31.940
Well, what are the odds?

58:32.843 --> 58:34.776
(chuckles) This is crazy.

58:35.579 --> 58:37.679
DREW: Yeah. Well, we came
for dinner and we saw Erin

58:37.681 --> 58:40.549
-and she's waiting for somebody.
-Yeah. Me, actually.

58:41.619 --> 58:43.852
I figured I'd take the kid out,
give her some pointers.

58:44.221 --> 58:45.988
Don't fly into the sun,
that kind of thing.

58:45.990 --> 58:47.723
We're not supposed
to fraternize.

58:48.125 --> 58:50.792
-MARK: Well, that's a big word.
-Outside of work.

58:50.961 --> 58:52.928

ERIN: Yeah.

58:54.765 --> 58:57.032
MARK: You might say. Yeah?
You're not gonna tell on me,
are you, Drew?

58:57.033 --> 58:59.300
DREW: No. Won't say a word.
Now, why don't you sit?

58:59.301 --> 59:01.568

-MARK: Oh! You know what? Uh,

59:01.572 --> 59:03.672
on my way over here,
my ex called,

59:03.674 --> 59:05.607
and I have to pick up my kids.

59:05.609 --> 59:06.775
I'm sorry.
I would've called you,

59:06.777 --> 59:08.076
but I don't have your number.

59:08.078 --> 59:10.612
ERIN: Oh, yeah. No, sure,
you should go do that.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.083

like this. Wow.

59:15.619 --> 59:16.818

-Yeah.

59:16.820 --> 59:18.887

-DREW: Well, good seeing you.

59:20.991 --> 59:22.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:22.293 --> 59:25.093

-What?

1:05:03.901 --> 1:05:05.166
Don't trust it.

-I love you.
-I love you, too. Sure.

1:05:15.379 --> 1:05:17.412
But can you tell me one thing
that is different

1:05:17.614 --> 1:05:20.515
about the world because you
and I have a feeling?

1:05:22.052 --> 1:05:23.652
-Everything's different.
-Well, yeah.

To you. In your head.

It's like believing in God.

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:42.070
What's happening right now?

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:46.207
You went to space...

1:05:47.477 --> 1:05:49.110
and you saw the vast...

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:54.716

and it blew your fucking mind.

1:06:04.161 --> 1:06:06.261
Well, brain doesn't know

1:06:06.263 --> 1:06:07.595
that you're having
an existential crisis.

1:06:07.597 --> 1:06:09.631
Brain just knows
that when we fuck...

1:06:10.334 --> 1:06:11.700
it feels good.

1:06:13.003 --> 1:06:14.369
So, you focus on that.

1:06:15.172 --> 1:06:16.338
That feeling.

1:06:18.108 --> 1:06:20.342
Because it seems real.

1:06:23.213 --> 1:06:24.646

DREW: I've been trying you
for hours.

1:07:53.670 --> 1:07:56.538
I had a late night
putting in training modules.

1:07:58.175 --> 1:07:59.374
I'm home.

1:08:04.614 --> 1:08:06.114

1:08:07.384 --> 1:08:09.751
Listen, work got a little harder
than I thought, and...

1:08:09.753 --> 1:08:12.654
it's been a rough
couple of weeks, you know.

1:08:12.656 --> 1:08:14.089

1:08:15.725 --> 1:08:17.392

1:08:26.603 --> 1:08:27.802
What? How?

1:08:27.804 --> 1:08:30.255

The glove compartment

How? Wait.

1:12:31.448 --> 1:12:33.481

The point is

1:12:33.482 --> 1:12:35.515
you're driving around
with a loaded gun

1:12:35.518 --> 1:12:36.718

1:12:45.829 --> 1:12:47.528
Why is there a fucking gun
in your car?

1:12:47.530 --> 1:12:49.430
I had to put it someplace safe.

1:12:49.799 --> 1:12:51.616

It's not an issue, sir.
I won't miss any training.

I'm fine, really. I just...

1:23:13.622 --> 1:23:15.489
I thought my time would be
better spent, you know...

1:23:15.491 --> 1:23:18.025
Lucy. You had a helmet breach.

1:23:18.361 --> 1:23:20.361
Your hat filled with water,
and you were without oxygen

1:23:20.363 --> 1:23:21.462
for two minutes.

1:23:22.131 --> 1:23:23.564
But I finished the job.

FRANK: That's not the...

1:23:28.137 --> 1:23:29.770
If that happened up there,
you'd be dead.

1:23:29.772 --> 1:23:31.038
Do you understand?

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.108
And maybe we lose another
astronaut trying to save you.

1:23:34.109 --> 1:23:37.177
That's... Um... Sir. (inhales)

1:23:39.081 --> 1:23:42.082
I'm giving everything
to this program, to the mission.

1:23:42.385 --> 1:23:44.685
Believe me. You can't just...

1:23:45.588 --> 1:23:48.655
I need to get back up there.
I mean, I want to go back.

1:23:48.657 --> 1:23:52.226
To serve you. NASA. My country.

1:23:55.498 --> 1:23:57.531
I'm pulling you out
of the running for Orion.

1:23:59.735 --> 1:24:01.702
-No.
-Excuse me?

1:24:05.274 --> 1:24:06.407

1:24:09.779 --> 1:24:11.211
Sir, please.

1:24:12.114 --> 1:24:14.048
I was born to do this.

1:24:15.618 --> 1:24:17.217
It's all I have.

1:24:25.094 --> 1:24:27.761
FRANK: I'll make sure you're
in the running for<i> Polaris</i>
three years out.

1:24:28.197 --> 1:24:30.297

to take a little time.

1:26:29.351 --> 1:26:31.451
One day, you're gonna be
working your hardest...

1:26:34.523 --> 1:26:36.890
Some man is gonna tell you
you're too emotional.

1:26:36.892 --> 1:26:38.659
You're gonna think,
"What does that even mean?

1:26:38.661 --> 1:26:40.194
I have feelings, sure.

1:26:40.196 --> 1:26:42.763
I know, maybe I'm sad
or pissed, but I'm not that,

1:26:42.765 --> 1:26:44.298
I'm not too emotional.

1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:46.400

1:26:46.402 --> 1:26:48.936

he's really saying is,

1:29:46.749 --> 1:29:48.482

I-- I get them all the time.

No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:30:15.444 --> 1:30:17.878
He just-- he grounded me
for no fucking reason.

1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:19.846
-And you gotta talk to him.
-I will. All right, Lucy.

1:30:19.848 --> 1:30:23.817
But for right now, I want you
to get some rest, okay?

1:30:24.086 --> 1:30:27.487
You are spiraling.
You need to shut your brain off.

1:30:27.990 --> 1:30:30.690

1:34:51.887 --> 1:34:53.420

-Paper or plastic?
-What?

1:35:36.965 --> 1:35:39.199
The bag.
You want paper or plastic?

1:35:40.102 --> 1:35:42.335
Plastic. No, no, paper.

1:35:44.172 --> 1:35:45.171
No, no, wait.

1:35:45.173 --> 1:35:48.441
What's the tensile strength
of both bags, approximately?

1:35:49.444 --> 1:35:50.510
What?

1:35:50.512 --> 1:35:53.313
You know, fuck it. Double it up.
Paper in plastic.

1:35:56.384 --> 1:35:58.852
What? It's a road trip.

1:36:01.123 --> 1:36:02.188
LUCY: Oh.

1:36:07.929 --> 1:36:08.995
All right.

1:36:09.297 --> 1:36:10.363

1:36:17.372 --> 1:36:18.772
LUCY: Sir.

1:36:18.774 --> 1:36:22.175
I won't lie. Being up there,
the experience...

1:36:23.111 --> 1:36:27.881
I wasn't ready. I-- I was ready
for the job. I did the job.

1:36:28.784 --> 1:36:30.950
But the experience...

1:36:31.386 --> 1:36:33.486
One thousand four hundred
and sixty miles

1:36:33.488 --> 1:36:36.956
at 70 miles per hour
equals 20.9 hours.

1:36:37.225 --> 1:36:41.394
Assuming 2.5 stops to refuel,
maximum nine minutes per stop.

1:36:41.530 --> 1:36:43.129
Now, synchronize watches.

1:36:43.799 --> 1:36:46.166
Flight arrival time
is 1900 hours tomorrow.

1:36:46.168 --> 1:36:47.934
Requiring
a hard departure time of...

1:36:50.872 --> 1:36:52.505
2000 hours tonight.

1:36:52.941 --> 1:36:55.208
Current time is 18:16.

1:36:55.477 --> 1:37:00.380
ETA to departure is one hour
and 44 minutes from...

1:37:02.551 --> 1:37:03.817

1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:07.287
I don't have a watch.

1:37:07.889 --> 1:37:09.455
Just get in the car.

1:37:46.194 --> 1:37:47.594
Here's one.

1:37:48.597 --> 1:37:53.600
In what way is your life
like a pregnant teenager?

1:37:53.602 --> 1:37:54.901
Not now.

1:37:55.237 --> 1:37:59.072
You can't unfuck
a pregnant teenager.

1:37:59.074 --> 1:38:00.406
(laughs)

1:38:00.575 --> 1:38:04.210
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mrs. Know-it-all.

1:38:04.212 --> 1:38:07.580
Well, I know things.
I know things.

1:38:09.651 --> 1:38:10.917
He's gonna see reason.

1:38:10.919 --> 1:38:14.287
He's a reasonable person.
Paxton. He's gonna see reason.

1:38:16.358 --> 1:38:21.294
I think all this astronaut dick
has made you soft.

1:38:21.630 --> 1:38:23.396
-Oh, I'm soft?
-Mm-hmm.

1:38:23.398 --> 1:38:24.664
I'm soft?

1:38:25.433 --> 1:38:28.034
I took eight G's
and didn't even blink.

1:38:28.536 --> 1:38:30.403
How many G's can you take?

1:38:31.373 --> 1:38:34.374
Oh, that's right, none.
Because you're fucking dead.

1:38:37.178 --> 1:38:39.078
What are you doing?

1:38:40.215 --> 1:38:43.149
I'm on a rescue mission.
Low Earth orbit.

1:38:43.151 --> 1:38:45.518
Somebody got left behind
up there.

1:38:46.521 --> 1:38:47.587
Who?

1:38:48.089 --> 1:38:49.322
Me!

1:39:26.227 --> 1:39:27.493
It's a purpose.

1:39:28.697 --> 1:39:30.263
It's my purpose.

1:39:32.033 --> 1:39:34.033
<i> You know sometimes</i>

1:39:34.369 --> 1:39:38.237

1:39:38.239 --> 1:39:40.139
And you'd need to bring
thrusters online

1:39:40.141 --> 1:39:42.075
just to get her back on track.

1:39:42.077 --> 1:39:43.509
You know,
give her a little push.

1:39:43.712 --> 1:39:46.379
That's all I needed, a nudge.

1:39:46.381 --> 1:39:48.281
You know,
just course correction.

1:39:48.416 --> 1:39:49.983
And you wouldn't do that for me.

1:39:49.985 --> 1:39:51.718
And now I have
to do it for myself.

1:39:55.156 --> 1:39:56.589
(line disconnects)

1:40:01.696 --> 1:40:02.762

-So this-- this-- Don't do this.
-Nothing matters.

1:46:53.074 --> 1:46:54.740
Nothing matters.
That's what you said.

-Okay.
-You think it's a butterfly...

Your body. Right?

not even a mistake.

1:48:06.848 --> 1:48:08.781
