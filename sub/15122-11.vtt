WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:08.008
I made Christmas cookies.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.511
Um, Maw Maw,

00:10.578 --> 00:11.879
these aren't
cookies.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.682
They're dirt clods
with little rocks in them.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.050
Oh, let her have this.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.551
It's the holidays.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.753
Wilfred, these are
your favorite--

00:19.820 --> 00:21.122
Snickerdoodles!

00:23.224 --> 00:26.460
Oh... wouldn't want
to spoil my dinner.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.728
Eat it!

00:29.930 --> 00:32.633
Burt... it's Christmas.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.639
Mmm.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.642
(rocks crunching)
Mmm.

00:45.146 --> 00:49.417
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh *

00:55.589 --> 00:57.658
Don't look so nervous;
you'll blow the deal.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.267
Don't forget to let the junkies
know where the supply is.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.375
There's our little
moneymakers.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.010
This year's impossible-
to-get Christmas toy,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.147
My Baby Sneezes.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.582
(sneezes)

01:21.649 --> 01:23.917
Ooh, big mucus
on that one.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.486
It's stupid.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.222
What kind of idiot
wants to play with a sick baby?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.224
What kind of idiot wants
to play with any baby?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.193
You see I'm playing
with a baby, right?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.861
Speaking of which,
don't forget,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.062
one of these is for Hope.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.264
Bad move.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.732
She gets good toys,
she wants a good car,

01:38.799 --> 01:40.501
then she wants to go
to a good college,

01:40.568 --> 01:42.470
and that costs, like,
$10,000 a year,

01:42.536 --> 01:43.437
and then
you're screwed.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.005
Besides, it's confusing

01:45.072 --> 01:47.608
for a baby to play with a doll
that's the same age as her.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.477
She might think it's unfriendly.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.278
Or dead.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.879
No, she won't.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.547
She's getting the doll.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.848
I don't want her missing out

01:54.915 --> 01:57.451
on all the good toys,
like I always did.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.420
Every year, I'd get so excited

01:59.487 --> 02:01.722
sitting beside
a big pile of toys,

02:01.789 --> 02:04.458
not knowing my dad was
selling them at a crazy markup.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.327
You have a lot of balls.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.332
And as Christmas got closer,
I got more psyched.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.201
You have a lot of balls.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.206
But by Christmas Eve,
he sold every last toy...

02:20.441 --> 02:22.075
...and I got stuck with crap.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.445
You have a lot of balls.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.979
We needed that money.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.881
For food and
electricity.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.350
Yeah, what would you
rather have,

02:29.417 --> 02:32.320
a Cabbage Patch Kid
or some cabbage?

02:32.386 --> 02:34.588
Well, I'd rather have
the kid on that one,

02:34.655 --> 02:37.525
but let's say they made a
doll called Pot Roast Kid.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.859
Then you get
the point.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.328
It was Christmas.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.630
You should've saved
one good toy for me.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.965
One of these dolls is gonna be
for Hope this year.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.167
Fine, but it's coming
out of your cut.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.570
Beanie Babies or beans.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.771
That would've worked.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.345
I don't know about
keeping Maw Maw on that leash.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.912
I don't think God would like it.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.881
VIRGINIA: I don't think
God liked it last week

03:00.948 --> 03:02.716
when she wandered off
and made instant oatmeal

03:02.783 --> 03:03.551
with the holy water.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.286
He might have
chuckled at that.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.187
God I pray to likes
to keep it light.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.356
I'm gonna go
to the nursery

03:08.422 --> 03:09.790
to pick up Hope.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.125
Oh, my goodness, Burt, look!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.161
A living nativity.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.764
Remember when Jimmy
played baby Jesus?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.499
Oh, yeah! He was good.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.734
I'd put him up against
any baby version

03:20.801 --> 03:22.403
of any of the other
religions' gods.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.872
That's the only time
any of these uptight women

03:24.938 --> 03:26.173
looked at me with any respect.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.409
I'm gonna go sign up Hope.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.011
Hey, hey-ho!

03:31.078 --> 03:32.380
Easy, girl.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.614
(clicks tongue)

03:33.681 --> 03:35.516
Hey, Burt. How's
it going, buddy?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.017
God, I haven't
seen you in ages.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.051
What's it been?
Like, uh...

03:38.118 --> 03:39.420
A year. It's been a year.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.954
You can stop sucking up.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.256
How many dolls you need?

03:42.323 --> 03:44.091
Four.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.794
My wife tricked me into
adopting another little girl.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.497
Etatu. She's from
God knows where.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.299
Hey, Mrs. Thompson,
how's it going?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.503
It's amazing she
is still alive.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.137
Yeah, I thought
she'd kick the bucket

03:57.204 --> 03:58.772
and leave us the house
years ago.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.442
She's kind of messing up
my plans for early retirement.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.111
Too bad she didn't
die this year.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.414
No estate
taxes in 2010.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.115
If she dies in the
next two weeks,

04:08.181 --> 04:10.117
you wouldn't have to
pay taxes on the house.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.554
Arthur, are you suggesting
I kill my grandmother-in-law?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.556
I'm not saying you
should kill her.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.626
I'm just saying she's lived
a nice long life.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.894
And if God decides
to bring her home,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.464
maybe you shouldn't keep
her on such a tight leash.

04:24.498 --> 04:28.268
(cell phone ringing)

04:28.336 --> 04:30.871
Better Lawn Service
and Pool Cleaning.

04:30.938 --> 04:35.108
You gals have done such
a great job with the manger.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.277
The animals and the decorations.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.613
And I just know
that Hope is going to be

04:39.680 --> 04:41.749
the cherry on top of that cake.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.751
Yes, I hear
you're a grandma now.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.818
Mm-hmm.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.587
I guess you and Burt's
little accident

04:46.654 --> 04:48.322
had his own little accident.
(chuckles)

04:48.389 --> 04:52.393
Well, that's what happens when
you're young and attractive.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.862
Oh, here's our
cute majestic

04:54.928 --> 04:56.229
little sweetie now.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.098
Hi, pumpkin.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.867
Jimmy, I just signed Hope up

04:59.933 --> 05:02.570
to be the next great messiah
from the Chance family.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.773
Sort of a second coming,
if you will.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.775
No. No, no, no.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.378
You're not doing to Hope
what you did to me.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.113
(chuckles)

05:13.180 --> 05:14.382
(car horn honks)

05:16.283 --> 05:18.552
(tires screech)

05:20.020 --> 05:21.221
Sorry, Burt!

05:21.288 --> 05:22.390
Too many witnesses!

05:22.456 --> 05:23.657
Good luck, though.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.201
VIRGINIA: Fine. If you want
to be pig-headed,

05:34.267 --> 05:35.636
that's your "peroxitive."

05:35.703 --> 05:38.806
But you will be depriving
your daughter of a huge honor

05:38.872 --> 05:41.308
if she was selected
for the manger.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.677
If that was what it was really
about, I'd be fine with it.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.513
But the only reason
you want Hope to be baby Jesus

05:45.579 --> 05:46.614
is so you can be Mary.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.281
That is

05:48.348 --> 05:50.451
the farthest thing in

05:50.518 --> 05:53.053
the universe from the truth.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.523
So you won't be Mary
if they choose Hope to be Jesus?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.660
Well, I would have to be Mary.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.495
Sure.
Because it's always
the mother of the baby.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.063
It's all about
the baby. Right.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.665
Uh-huh, yep.
And since Hope's
mother isn't around,

06:04.732 --> 06:06.033
it only makes sense that I...
Of course.

06:06.099 --> 06:06.700
Shut up!

06:06.767 --> 06:08.035
You're using Hope

06:08.101 --> 06:09.102
the same way you used me.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.538
You forced me in
every church children's play

06:10.604 --> 06:12.540
and talent show there was,
then you'd figure out

06:12.606 --> 06:14.442
some reason to get yourself
on stage.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.143
My story is the story

06:16.209 --> 06:20.147
of our nation's heroic founding
father George Washington.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.583
As told by his wife.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.152
That's me.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.855
And I shall telleth ye my story
through song.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.893
(hip-hop beat playing)

06:32.960 --> 06:37.465
* He fought hard for our nation,
he could not be impatient *

06:37.531 --> 06:42.369
* He crossed the Delaware
in a boat. *

06:42.436 --> 06:44.538
(applause)

06:44.605 --> 06:48.075
I really feel that
I elevated the material.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.211
I'm not letting you
use Hope as your prop.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.012
Your coffee's ready, dear.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.686
There was a spider on the, uh...

06:58.752 --> 07:00.554
what do you call it,
where it ends,

07:00.621 --> 07:01.789
the-the top,

07:01.855 --> 07:03.624
where it ends,
where the mug ends?

07:03.691 --> 07:05.493
The brim?
The brim.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.761
There was a spider on the brim.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.031
Here you go, Sabrina.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.566
And James,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.201
you are going to be Rudolph.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.538
(mocking laugh)

07:19.306 --> 07:20.674
Uh, it's wet.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.242
Yeah, Josh was
going to be Rudolph,

07:22.309 --> 07:23.410
but he went home
with a cold.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.278
Oh.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.815
Oh, by the way, did you bring
that doll for my friend?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.349
Uh, yeah, it's in my van.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.118
Here.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.121
I can't believe
parents pay 200 bucks

07:34.187 --> 07:35.689
for a doll that sneezes.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.324
Yeah, you should see
what they're charging

07:37.390 --> 07:38.391
for snot refill
cartridges.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.027
Hi.
Hi.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.595
So I went by the church,
and nobody

07:41.662 --> 07:42.763
signed up for
baby Jesus yet.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.598
Hope can still be in the manger.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.699
I don't want to talk about it.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.701
I love those live
nativity scenes.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.336
I always wanted
to be in one.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.105
It'd be like camping with Jesus.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.206
So...

07:54.374 --> 07:56.977
She's a manger fan.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.812
* Do you hear *

07:58.879 --> 08:00.548
* What I hear? *

08:00.614 --> 08:01.782
Stop.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.483
Here's what
I'm thinking, Sabrina.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.787
You should be
in our manger with us.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.355
Mom!
Seriously?

08:08.421 --> 08:10.891
Yeah. If Hope is baby Jesus,
then as her guardians,

08:10.958 --> 08:12.860
we get to pick
the rest of the cast.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.494
It's a great way to glorify God.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.163
And also make
people jealous

08:16.229 --> 08:18.732
when they see us featured
on the Channel Three news.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.301
That would be so much fun.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.369
Wyatt would be mad.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.537
I'm supposed to hang out

08:23.604 --> 08:25.338
with his family
on Christmas Eve.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.608
She would do it with us

08:27.675 --> 08:30.210
even if it makes
her boyfriend mad.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.312
* Do you hear *

08:32.379 --> 08:34.047
* What I hear? *

08:34.114 --> 08:35.215
* A child... *

08:35.282 --> 08:36.950
Sign her up.
Thank you.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.322
Our annual tithing drive
starts in three weeks.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.492
Um, this year's motto:

08:45.559 --> 08:47.961
I upped my pledge, up yours.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.565
Okay, lastly,
I'm happy to announce

08:51.632 --> 08:53.634
that we have finally found
our baby Jesus.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.103
And our 40-year tradition

08:56.169 --> 08:59.239
of a living nativity scene
will be unbroken.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.407
(applause)

09:00.473 --> 09:01.474
(whispers):
We're heroes.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.944
This year, we will use

09:04.011 --> 09:06.346
all donations collected
at the living nativity scene

09:06.413 --> 09:07.547
to repair the organ.

09:07.615 --> 09:11.051
(organ plays low and off-key)

09:11.118 --> 09:13.286
And now,

09:13.353 --> 09:16.790
I'd like to introduce the baby
that's become our little savior,

09:16.857 --> 09:20.227
along with the family
who will make up the rest of

09:20.293 --> 09:22.429
this year's
living nativity scene.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.632
Please give
a warm welcome to...

09:24.698 --> 09:26.099
the Huang family.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.567
Come on up, guys.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.737
(applause)

09:31.672 --> 09:34.007
That is a big
baby Jesus.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.911
No way that kid
came out of a virgin.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.652
Hi.
Hi.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.086
Welcome to the church.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.055
Beautiful family.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.623
So sweet.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.359
So they're the ones who'll be
in the manger, huh?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.694
Yes. Yes.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.763
The Huangs are new
to the congregation,

09:55.829 --> 09:57.064
and the committee just
felt like we should

09:57.130 --> 09:58.398
ask them if they'd
be interested.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.100
(stifles laugh)

10:00.167 --> 10:01.134
Okay.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.970
So you guys didn't even
sign up then, huh?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.905
No. Until we
converted last week,

10:04.972 --> 10:06.640
we didn't even know
what a manger was.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.941
(chuckles):
That is great.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.778
Team players. Wow.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.246
Again, really,
beautiful family.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.648
Excuse us.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.116
What is going on?

10:16.183 --> 10:19.687
Look, the nativity scene
needs to attract big donations

10:19.753 --> 10:21.188
if we're gonna
replace the organ.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.756
Now, I know that

10:22.823 --> 10:24.858
an Asian Jesus is unorthodox...

10:24.925 --> 10:27.661
Whoa. I am fine
with an Asian Jesus,

10:27.728 --> 10:29.129
but let's be real here.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.531
That's a three-year-old fat kid.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.833
Where in the Bible

10:32.900 --> 10:34.601
does it say the wise men
brought gifts

10:34.668 --> 10:35.836
to a three-year-old fat kid?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.938
Well, to be perfectly honest,
Virginia,

10:38.005 --> 10:40.173
we were just a little bit afraid
that Hope might

10:40.240 --> 10:42.442
scare people away
with her reputation.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.277
Reputation?

10:44.344 --> 10:47.014
What, has word got out
that she drools?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.782
No, no, we were willing
to overlook that,

10:48.849 --> 10:50.117
but we just can't
overlook the fact

10:50.183 --> 10:51.885
that she's a murderer's baby.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.989
JIMMY:
A murderer's baby.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.192
That's what people
call my daughter.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.828
Unbelievable, right?

11:00.894 --> 11:04.097
People in this town just love
to give out labels.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.232
Maw Maw!

11:05.298 --> 11:07.000
That's a TV fire.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.803
If you break the glass,
you could electrocute yourself.

11:09.870 --> 11:13.540
It's like when I got
pregnant with you.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.075
All of a sudden
people didn't see me

11:15.142 --> 11:16.476
as the captain of the drill team

11:16.543 --> 11:18.979
or the girl who could
roller-skate backwards

11:19.046 --> 11:21.048
down the big dirt hill
behind the bank.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.783
No, I was "the pregnant girl."

11:22.850 --> 11:24.017
People suck, Hope.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.118
It's time you knew that.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.088
Hell, that's why
I loved

11:28.155 --> 11:30.190
doing the manger so much.

11:30.257 --> 11:34.661
Because, for one night a year,
people didn't see me as trash

11:34.728 --> 11:36.563
that got knocked up by the guy

11:36.629 --> 11:38.365
who never wore
a shirt to school.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.068
I was the Virgin Mary.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.403
I just don't want Hope
to suffer like you did.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.839
There has to be some way
to change your label.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.174
There is.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.479
She can be Baby Jesus.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.821
(sighs)

12:02.322 --> 12:07.194
Hi, Kate! See ya at Christmas
Eve, you judgmental bitch!

12:15.936 --> 12:18.338
Your lucky day,
this Christmas Eve.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.373
I'll give you one of my
Baby Sneezes for 250 bucks.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.843
Good God,
it was $40 in the store!

12:22.910 --> 12:24.544
I'm sorry. I'm hurting, too.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.946
I got two broken lawn mowers

12:26.013 --> 12:27.447
and my diaper bill's
doubled this year.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.953
Merry Christmas!

12:35.255 --> 12:37.090
Hey, where's
the other two wise men?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.292
We're gonna pick
Sabrina up on the way.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.761
Jimmy's still trying to make
himself look pretty for her.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.030
Thank goodness,
back in Jesus' time,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.197
one wise man wasn't trying

12:44.264 --> 12:45.765
to get in another
wise man's pants,

12:45.833 --> 12:46.934
'cause they never would
have got there.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.068
Well, I'll see you there.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.803
I gotta go meet the guy
with the lambs.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.438
Hey, did he ask you
about the camels?

12:51.504 --> 12:53.974
He doesn't have camels.
He says they spit.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.508
So what? I spit.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.810
Bring it on, camel!

12:56.877 --> 12:59.212
There is no camel, Burt.
Leave it!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.181
So, listen,
here's the plan.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.450
I'm gonna be at the manger
with Hope and Maw Maw.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.252
You, Jimmy and Sabrina
wait around the corner,

13:05.318 --> 13:07.320
in your truck,
until I light my Roman candles.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.157
When you see the lights
in the sky,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.125
follow them to the manger.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.360
Firework star of Bethlehem.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.562
I love how you can take
something good,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.331
like the birth of Christ,
and you make it even better!

13:18.398 --> 13:20.033
It's what I do.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.135
My manger's gonna raise
way more money

13:22.202 --> 13:23.570
for that organ than Kate's.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.573
Come on, Maw Maw!

13:31.879 --> 13:34.214
You enjoying your Joseph
costume, Maw Maw?

13:34.281 --> 13:38.151
Who the hell moved my vagina?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.091
(horn beeps twice)

13:46.293 --> 13:48.461
Oh, hey,
here's your cut

13:48.528 --> 13:51.098
from the doll I sold
back at the house.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.466
Cool. I thought we were
all out of, um...

13:53.533 --> 13:55.936
Wait. Did you sell him
Hope's doll?!

13:56.003 --> 13:57.104
I didn't sell him
Hope's doll.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.805
No, no! You always do this!
I didn't sell

13:58.872 --> 14:00.040
him Hope's doll! Calm down!

14:00.107 --> 14:01.942
I didn't sell him
Hope's doll.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.643
Stop jumping
to conclusions.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.913
Man! Gaah!

14:05.979 --> 14:08.748
I'm sorry.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.651
It's okay.
I understand.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.752
Mistakes happen.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.155
I forgive you.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.724
Was Hope's doll the one
on the piano?

14:17.790 --> 14:18.992
Yes!

14:19.059 --> 14:20.994
God!
I can't believe you!
I'm sorry!

14:21.061 --> 14:23.863
Why not?! We just established
mistakes happen.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.132
If you recall,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.234
when it was your mistake,
I forgave you!

14:27.300 --> 14:30.437
What up, wise homies?
We're in a tiff.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.672
Yeah, because you screwed Hope
out of getting the good toy

14:32.739 --> 14:33.907
like you always did to me!

14:33.974 --> 14:35.042
And I really wanted
this Christmas

14:35.108 --> 14:36.176
to start off
better for her!

14:36.243 --> 14:37.544
(mock crying)
Shut up!

14:37.610 --> 14:39.246
What's with
this sneeze doll?
Why don't you

14:39.312 --> 14:40.613
just give Hope the one
you sold my friend?

14:40.680 --> 14:41.581
He lives right down
the street.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.050
No, no, we'd just be

14:43.116 --> 14:44.884
screwing over some other kid.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
Oh, my friend
doesn't have a kid.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.956
Why would someone want
a My Baby Sneezes

14:49.022 --> 14:50.490
if they didn't have a kid?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.925
I collect toys.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.661
There's nothing weird about it.
Lots of people collect toys.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.163
It's kinda weird.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.531
This is why I wanted
to remain anonymous.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.301
I should fire Sabrina
first thing Monday.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.670
(manly Italian accent):
No, no, no!

15:03.736 --> 15:06.873
Don't a-fire the girl.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.410
We, uh, roughed her up
a-pretty good

15:10.477 --> 15:11.979
for that information.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.548
I'm-a from Italy.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.486
There's nothing weird at all
about collecting dolls,

15:19.552 --> 15:22.455
but I really meant
to save one for my daughter,

15:22.522 --> 15:24.191
and we're kind of in a hurry.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.726
Well, I can't sell it to you.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.761
Where would I find another
doll by Christmas morning?

15:28.828 --> 15:30.097
I like to wrap it

15:30.163 --> 15:31.999
and have it waiting under
the tree for myself.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.333
(whistles "crazy")

15:33.400 --> 15:35.835
I work hard all year.
I deserve nice things.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.104
(phone rings)

15:37.170 --> 15:39.672
What's up, sexy?

15:39.739 --> 15:42.142
Hey, Elizabeth Spicer McDonald
is here from Channel 3

15:42.209 --> 15:44.144
and she's about to pick
which manger to shoot.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.478
Are you in position?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.913
We're not far.

15:46.980 --> 15:50.183
We're in this dude's house.
He's a trip.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.918
No, not you. Another dude.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.186
(hushed):
It's this dude.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.055
He's got dolls having tea
with other dolls.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.156
Burt, can we talk

15:56.223 --> 15:57.357
about this another time?

15:57.424 --> 15:59.026
I need you to come here
and get in position.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.828
Will do. And I'll take pictures
of this place with my phone.

16:01.894 --> 16:02.829
You're gonna have a cow.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.431
Burt!
On it. Bye.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.533
Jimmy man, we gots to boogie.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.169
Barney, please, I'll give you
my cut of the profit

16:09.236 --> 16:11.004
from all the other dolls
we sold.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.839
It's, like, 800 bucks.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.576
Whoo! That's really tempting.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.247
Ooh, I don't know.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.748
Oh.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.489
Ah! Stupid Christmas.

16:30.923 --> 16:34.727
Here's my half of the profits,
too, to make up for not

16:34.794 --> 16:36.763
giving you the cool gift
all those years.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.200
I'm not such a bad
selfish dad now, am I?

16:42.735 --> 16:44.003
Here's $800 more.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.473
$1,200, actually.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.875
I was ripping him off
a little bit.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.078
The biggest shocker
about Barney--

16:51.144 --> 16:53.080
he's straight.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.547
(engine starts)

16:54.614 --> 16:56.216
No, no, no!

16:56.283 --> 16:58.618
You can't just tow
my truck for no reason!

17:03.022 --> 17:05.558
Oh, that's dirty pool!

17:21.074 --> 17:25.312
We'll see who brings the most
peace on Earth, bitch.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.151
Is that our star?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.123
Virginia's so bad-ass.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.433
(switch clicks,
gentle music plays)

17:48.601 --> 17:55.842
* O, holy night, the stars
are brightly shining *

17:55.908 --> 17:59.879
* It is the night
of the dear Savior's birth... *

17:59.946 --> 18:02.515
Dancing Dan, I'm all
alone over here.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.817
And those people
all make fun of you.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.619
We almost never do.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.456
Maw Maw, wake up!

18:09.522 --> 18:11.524
Don't be sacrilegious.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.726
The Son of God was just born,
for cripe's sake!

18:13.793 --> 18:19.299
* For yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn *

18:19.366 --> 18:24.070
* Fall on your knees *

18:24.137 --> 18:31.944
* O, hear the angel voices *

18:32.011 --> 18:40.320
* O, night divine *

18:40.387 --> 18:43.556
* O, night *

18:43.623 --> 18:48.161
* When Christ was born *

18:48.228 --> 18:52.665
* O, night *

18:52.732 --> 19:00.740
* O, holy evermore proclaim... *

19:02.642 --> 19:05.178
Looks like we're not
gonna be on the news.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.349
And Hope's gonna still be known
as the murderer's baby.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.619
Good luck finding that on a tiny
novelty license plate.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.024
Hold on.

19:18.090 --> 19:24.797
* O, night divine *

19:24.864 --> 19:26.433
* O, night *

19:26.499 --> 19:31.271
* When Christ was born... *

19:31.338 --> 19:33.373
(crowd gasps)

19:33.440 --> 19:36.108
It's the Baby Sneezus!

19:36.175 --> 19:37.677
He's got a Baby Sneezus!

19:37.744 --> 19:41.748
We'll be auctioning off
the last available Baby Sneezus

19:41.814 --> 19:45.885
across the street,
in our living nativity.

19:45.952 --> 19:50.490
All proceeds will go
towards a new organ.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.625
Come on. Come on, guys.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.960
Come on. Let's get this.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.337
They're coming.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.906
Wake up, Maw Maw, and gaze
at Hope in exultation.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.944
Yes, that's
my granddaughter Hope

20:12.011 --> 20:13.913
as the Baby Jesus.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.916
Maybe the best Baby Jesus ever.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.686
Except for Baby Jesus.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.688
I know! I see it!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.923
They're re-running it again
on the noon news,

20:23.990 --> 20:25.858
the 3:00 and the 6:00 news.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.895
You spent $2,000
for a toy.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.929
Tell us about that.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.432
Well, I saw the people
bidding on TV

20:32.499 --> 20:34.100
and I had to come down
and buy this doll.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.735
It's for my niece.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.670
She works hard all year.
She deserves nice things.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.506
Better Lawn Care
and Pool Service

20:39.572 --> 20:41.508
for all your lawn
and pool needs!

20:43.510 --> 20:45.545
Sorry Hope didn't get her doll.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.013
Oh, it's okay.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.916
We gave her something more
important for Christmas:

20:49.982 --> 20:51.984
a new label for people
to know her by.

20:56.589 --> 21:02.329
* O, star of wonder,
star of night *

21:02.395 --> 21:03.963
GEORGIA:
Ooh!

21:04.030 --> 21:09.836
* Star with
royal beauty bright *

21:09.902 --> 21:13.873
(gagging)

21:13.940 --> 21:15.642
(groaning)

21:19.912 --> 21:22.549
(gagging, moaning)

21:27.354 --> 21:28.821
(coughs)

21:30.089 --> 21:32.825
Merry Christmas.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.899
Merry Christmas, amigos.
