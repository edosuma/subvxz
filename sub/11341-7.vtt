Oh, what are you doing?

00:17.489 --> 00:19.706
I'm gonna be late for work.

00:19.708 --> 00:20.907
The sun's not even up.

00:20.909 --> 00:22.292
It is in London.

00:22.294 --> 00:24.795
Your job sucks.

00:24.797 --> 00:27.414
Well,
it pays the bills.

00:27.416 --> 00:28.749
Yeah, well, not mine.

00:28.751 --> 00:30.133
Turn out the light.

00:30.135 --> 00:32.336
Don't I get
a kiss first?

00:32.338 --> 00:33.837
No.

00:33.839 --> 00:35.672
Please?

00:36.841 --> 00:38.541
One.

00:43.648 --> 00:45.349
One is not enough.

00:45.351 --> 00:46.683
Call me.

00:46.685 --> 00:48.018
We'll talk.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.220
You don't think
I'll call.

00:50.222 --> 00:51.738
I know you won't call.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.323
You'll text.

00:53.325 --> 00:55.659
Say, 'sup? Expect me
to come over

00:55.661 --> 00:57.611
and have sex with you
and go back home.

00:57.613 --> 01:00.497
Is it the entire male species that
you have a low opinion of

01:00.499 --> 01:01.915
or is it just me?

01:01.917 --> 01:04.733
Just you.

01:07.005 --> 01:09.706
I will call you tonight.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.925
I promise.

01:11.927 --> 01:13.960
And I'll
come back to you

01:13.962 --> 01:15.262
again.

01:15.264 --> 01:17.180
Good.

01:17.182 --> 01:18.748
Have fun at work.

01:42.074 --> 01:43.073
Dude...

01:43.075 --> 01:44.074
Kara, listen.

01:44.076 --> 01:45.292
I think I'm in love.

01:45.294 --> 01:46.660
Scotty just
left my place.

01:46.662 --> 01:48.328
Her name is Ashley.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.663
The guy at the bar.

01:49.665 --> 01:51.331
No, wait, it's not like that.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.632
There was a real connection.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.918
What do you think?
He just left.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.970
I'm telling you, man,
she's a game-changer.

01:56.972 --> 01:58.955
No, I know,
but it wasn't like that.

01:58.957 --> 02:01.174
It was...real.
She has a thing for bunnies.

02:01.176 --> 02:02.893
And when I say a thing,

02:02.895 --> 02:04.928
I mean she's seriously
obsessed.

02:04.930 --> 02:07.898
No, I will not tell
you his shoe size.

02:50.943 --> 02:54.694
That's where I saw Carolyn
the first time.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.480
No offense, Rossi,

02:56.482 --> 02:59.182
but this place
is kind of a dump.

02:59.184 --> 03:01.651
Oh, back then it wasn't.

03:01.653 --> 03:03.570
Back then the biggest names
would come here.

03:03.572 --> 03:06.106
Creedence, The Eagles,
Chicago.

03:06.108 --> 03:07.624
It was a Marine bar.

03:07.626 --> 03:09.025
They played for us jarheads.

03:09.027 --> 03:10.660
What was Carolyn
doing here?

03:10.662 --> 03:11.878
Waiting for Ringo.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.914
Beatlemania was no joke.

03:13.916 --> 03:16.133
I mean, it would make
the women crazy.

03:16.135 --> 03:18.502
She'd write them a letter
once a week,

03:18.504 --> 03:20.504
begging the band
to come visit.

03:20.506 --> 03:21.671
Did they ever come?

03:21.673 --> 03:24.141
Ringo did,
after his divorce.

03:24.143 --> 03:27.710
But luckily,
Carolyn met me first.

03:27.712 --> 03:29.896
But that's how
we all became friends.

03:29.898 --> 03:31.932
Devil honey for Dave.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.518
And an Arnold Palmer
for the kid.

03:37.989 --> 03:39.823
Oh, on second thought, Helen--

03:39.825 --> 03:41.057
it's Garcia.

03:41.059 --> 03:42.609
So much for a night off.

03:42.611 --> 03:44.161
You better bring us
the bill.

03:44.163 --> 03:45.579
Ok. That'll be 10 bucks.

03:45.581 --> 03:47.664
No, you can charge us
for the drinks we didn't have.

03:47.666 --> 03:51.368
Everything's marked down
until it's all gone.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.837
Oh, you can't close.

03:53.839 --> 03:55.455
This place is history.

03:55.457 --> 03:57.924
Unfortunately, Dave,
history doesn't pay the bills.

03:59.461 --> 04:01.595
Marines used to be
big business.

04:01.597 --> 04:05.799
Still are. That's why 3 new bars
opened up across the street.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.468
What's that thing they say
about competition?

04:08.470 --> 04:10.437
It breeds success?
It sucks.

04:10.439 --> 04:11.938
Well...

04:11.940 --> 04:13.756
Keep the change.

04:14.609 --> 04:16.358
Thank you, Dave.

04:18.613 --> 04:21.197
I hate to see this place go.

04:30.107 --> 04:33.393
Beantown has turned
into Chokeville.

04:33.395 --> 04:35.078
3 victims, all male,
wallets stolen.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.913
The unsub uses a garrote
to strangle his victims.

04:36.915 --> 04:38.712
He strikes at night and
there have been no witnesses.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.162
How much did he get?

04:40.164 --> 04:41.964
Well, it's odd. Each of the victims,
socio-economically,

04:41.966 --> 04:42.966
is lower to middle class.

04:42.987 --> 04:44.501
It's doubtful there would
have been much cash,

04:44.502 --> 04:47.036
and there have been no charge attempts
on any of the credit cards.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.704
So the murders might not
be about money at all.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.223
Taking the wallets could be
a forensic countermeasure

04:51.225 --> 04:52.758
so the murders might not
to delay victim identification.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.543
That could be the sitch
with the first two victims,

04:54.545 --> 04:56.012
but the latest one,
Scott Delfino,

04:56.014 --> 04:58.097
he was on the phone with his
roommate when he was attacked,

04:58.099 --> 05:01.684
call cut out unexpectedly, repeated
callbacks went straight to voicemail.

05:01.686 --> 05:03.152
And Delfino's body was found
an hour later.

05:03.154 --> 05:04.654
Indications were
they'd been blitzed.

05:04.656 --> 05:06.989
Which speaks to the killer's
prep work but also his desperation.

05:06.991 --> 05:08.491
He chose a location
to lay in wait

05:08.493 --> 05:10.943
but wasn't capable
of adapting to a target on the phone.

05:10.945 --> 05:12.495
That could be arrogance
getting in the way

05:12.497 --> 05:14.330
and making his organization
appear mixed.

05:14.332 --> 05:16.065
To me that screams
false confidence.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.917
Which means that desperation
is what's driving him.

05:17.919 --> 05:20.836
It's not about the kills,
it's about what the murders represent.

05:20.838 --> 05:22.004
He's mission oriented.

05:22.006 --> 05:23.923
He doesn't want
to kill them, he has to.

05:23.925 --> 05:27.877
Which suggests the unsub has
no personal connection to his victims.

05:27.879 --> 05:31.013
Except choking as a kill method
is extremely personal.

05:31.015 --> 05:33.632
He feels each victim
take their last breath.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.018
What if the wallets are a form
of depersonalization?

05:36.020 --> 05:38.087
He's stripping his victims
of their identities.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.555
Which means he may feel
stripped of his own.

05:39.557 --> 05:40.973
If the wallets are trophies,
he could be seeking

05:40.975 --> 05:42.308
recognition
for his work.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.760
And he may not stop killing
until he gets that recognition.

Ryan Maxford
worked as a counselor

08:02.922 --> 08:04.305
at a local boys home,

08:04.307 --> 08:06.641
and Scott Delfino worked
for Dynamo Industries,

08:06.643 --> 08:09.243
which is an international
pharmaceutical firm.

08:09.245 --> 08:11.362
Besides gender,
the victimology varies.

08:11.364 --> 08:13.531
He doesn't care
about age or race.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.316
He blends in and is
most likely unassuming.

08:15.318 --> 08:19.370
Yet has no problem taking down
a 6'5", 260-pound man.

08:19.372 --> 08:21.155
Maxford was a former
football all-American.

08:21.157 --> 08:25.276
Which probably rules out my unsub
as a woman who hates men theory.

08:25.278 --> 08:27.545
It'd be hard to gain
leverage on these guys.

08:27.547 --> 08:29.447
True, but hatred of men
might not be far off.

08:29.449 --> 08:31.165
The victims could be
surrogates.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.717
For someone else
or the unsub himself?

08:33.720 --> 08:35.169
It's too early to tell.

08:35.171 --> 08:37.554
If the unsub does feel
stripped of his own identity,

08:37.557 --> 08:39.590
he could be trying to make
these men appear the same way.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.976
He could be recognizing
in his victims a behavioral trait

08:41.977 --> 08:44.227
consistent with the object of
his rage that triggers him to kill.

08:44.230 --> 08:47.015
We need to determine where
he's finding his victims.

08:47.017 --> 08:49.183
Geographically speaking, none
of the victims live near one another,

08:49.185 --> 08:50.685
but they were all
killed downtown,

08:50.687 --> 08:52.136
which is where the unsub
likes to operate.

08:52.138 --> 08:53.855
That fits with
where Maxford works,

08:53.857 --> 08:56.074
but not with
the other two victims.

08:56.076 --> 08:58.359
His area of control,
while relatively small,

08:58.361 --> 09:00.244
includes a number of residential
and commercial buildings.

09:00.246 --> 09:02.864
Factoring in a 3-mile radius
in a city with a population

09:02.866 --> 09:06.984
of 636,479 over 48.28 miles,
we're looking at approximately

09:06.986 --> 09:11.956
39,549.23 people living
in his comfort zone.

09:11.958 --> 09:13.458
How many
of them male?

09:13.460 --> 09:15.493
18,944.08.

09:15.495 --> 09:17.962
Garcia, start with
the victim's known associates.

09:17.964 --> 09:19.680
We need a list of everyone
who lives and works downtown.

09:19.682 --> 09:21.849
On it. I'm a genius, too.

09:21.851 --> 09:23.768
Morgan, Blake, and I
will go to the field office

09:23.770 --> 09:25.803
and start with Garcia's list.
Dave, go to the M.E.

09:25.805 --> 09:27.838
and see what they can offer us.
JJ, you and Reid

09:27.840 --> 09:30.308
go to the scene where
Scott Delfino's body was found.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.809
His roommate's waiting
to talk to you there.

09:31.811 --> 09:34.896
Is that a good idea, talking to him
where his friend was murdered?

09:34.898 --> 09:37.148
Well, apparently he's insisting on it.
Boston P.D. says

09:37.150 --> 09:40.068
he won't leave the scene
until you do.

09:56.202 --> 09:57.868
This is Dr. Spencer Reid.

09:57.870 --> 10:00.004
You know, we didn't
have to do this here.

10:00.006 --> 10:01.973
We could have talked
back at our field office.

10:01.975 --> 10:04.375
I wanted to see
where it happened.

10:04.377 --> 10:07.428
I was talking to him
one second and then the...

10:08.897 --> 10:13.501
That's it. Gone.

10:13.503 --> 10:16.654
Right here
Scotty's story ends.

10:16.656 --> 10:18.389
Scotty must have been
coming from the east,

10:18.391 --> 10:20.891
otherwise the unsub's position
would have left him exposed.

10:20.893 --> 10:22.026
But?

10:22.028 --> 10:24.562
That Avenue offers
3 different directions to head

10:24.564 --> 10:26.230
in lieu of this alleyway,
so how did the unsub know

10:26.232 --> 10:28.616
Scotty was gonna choose
this particular one?

10:28.618 --> 10:31.169
You told the police
he met a girl last night.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.787
So walking home this way

10:32.789 --> 10:34.755
wouldn't be part of his
regular routine, right?

10:34.757 --> 10:35.873
No.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.175
When planning a blitz attack

10:37.177 --> 10:39.043
with varying avenues of
approach, what do you do?

10:39.045 --> 10:41.295
Eliminate the variable.
Strike as close as you can

10:41.297 --> 10:43.181
to the point of origin
or destination.

10:43.183 --> 10:45.466
But Scotty was still
miles away from home.

10:45.468 --> 10:47.084
The woman he met
lives nearby.

10:47.086 --> 10:48.586
Do you have any idea
who she was?

10:48.588 --> 10:52.190
Only that her name is Ashley
and she likes bunnies.

10:52.192 --> 10:55.109
Don't ask. It's the last
thing he said to me.

10:55.111 --> 10:56.427
Do you know
where they met?

10:56.429 --> 10:58.095
I'm not sure.
We were watching the Pats came

10:58.097 --> 10:59.763
at the Purple Shamrock,
and then I had to bail.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.599
I have to pick up my girlfriend
from Logan, so...

11:01.601 --> 11:03.151
Do you think Scotty
stayed there,

11:03.153 --> 11:04.986
or would he have ventured elsewhere
after you left?

11:04.988 --> 11:07.738
I don't know. There's so many bars
in the area.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.741
Scotty had a tendency to...

11:10.743 --> 11:11.942
wander.

11:11.944 --> 11:13.444
With women, you mean?

11:13.446 --> 11:15.880
Let's just say it wasn't often
that he slept alone.

11:15.882 --> 11:18.082
Did that rub anyone
the wrong way?

11:18.084 --> 11:20.384
Not anyone that knew him.

11:20.386 --> 11:22.953
He was too good
a guy not to like.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.984
What'd you find out?

11:36.986 --> 11:38.802
We just talked
to JJ.

11:38.804 --> 11:40.404
Scott Delfino's
roommate

11:40.406 --> 11:42.306
said something interesting.

11:42.308 --> 11:44.808
Apparently Delfino
was a womanizer

11:44.810 --> 11:46.694
but was too good
of a guy not to like.

11:46.696 --> 11:49.241
We heard something similar
from Ryan Maxford's family.

11:49.266 --> 11:50.699
Stand-up guy,

11:50.700 --> 11:52.533
but he was always broke
and asking for money.

11:52.535 --> 11:55.419
They would give it to him because
despite his flaws, everybody loved him.

11:55.421 --> 11:57.922
Well, that fits
Mike Dunsmore, too.

11:57.924 --> 11:59.707
He spent a quarter of
his income on marijuana,

11:59.709 --> 12:01.825
but he volunteered 5 morning
a week at a soup kitchen.

12:01.827 --> 12:05.680
It's a stretch, but could
this be our link?

12:05.682 --> 12:07.765
Is the unsub targeting men

12:07.767 --> 12:09.884
based on their supposed
character flaws?

12:09.886 --> 12:11.469
He'd have to have stalked them
well in advance.

12:11.471 --> 12:15.506
Why stalk someone you don't have
a personal connection to?

12:15.508 --> 12:17.642
Because he's not targeting
a specific person.

12:17.644 --> 12:19.227
He's targeting
a specific type.

12:19.229 --> 12:23.314
Men he thinks are
too good to be true.

13:10.946 --> 13:12.613
It's not the same.
What?

13:12.615 --> 13:13.897
Now, listen.

13:13.899 --> 13:15.666
I landed the trick.

13:15.668 --> 13:18.703
I've seen you...
It was sloppy, though.

13:18.705 --> 13:21.622
Oh, well, it's better
than your tricks.

13:21.624 --> 13:23.907
Wait up. Hey, stop.

13:26.511 --> 13:28.379
Yeah, here,
you pick up your board.

13:28.381 --> 13:30.765
Dude, put the
cigarettes away.

13:30.767 --> 13:31.732
Why?

13:31.734 --> 13:33.384
My mom talked to
Mrs. Herron yesterday.

13:33.386 --> 13:34.719
She found out
about the test?

13:34.721 --> 13:36.053
Yeah, and the 3
before that.

13:36.055 --> 13:38.689
So now I'm grounded
until the end of the semester.

13:38.691 --> 13:40.391
That's like 6 weeks.

13:40.393 --> 13:41.759
You don't think
I know that?

13:41.761 --> 13:43.361
She even took my PSP.

13:43.363 --> 13:44.895
No games
for a month and a half.

13:44.897 --> 13:47.298
So unless you want
your mom to do the same exact thing,

13:47.300 --> 13:48.766
I'd pocket
those cigarettes.

13:48.768 --> 13:49.934
You know what the problem is?

13:49.936 --> 13:51.168
Danny Terrido.

13:51.170 --> 13:52.436
You can't miss
the fight tonight.

13:52.438 --> 13:53.904
Without you, he'll kick
all of our asses.

13:53.906 --> 13:55.773
There's nothing
I can do about it.

13:55.775 --> 13:57.742
My PSP is locked up.

13:57.744 --> 13:59.493
Take mine.
Don't let your mom see it.

13:59.495 --> 14:01.746
We gotta play.
What about you?

14:01.748 --> 14:04.465
Parents at my brother's
game tonight. I'll steal his.

14:07.052 --> 14:08.419
That lady is so hot.

14:08.421 --> 14:09.837
Right. One of these days

14:09.839 --> 14:12.223
I'm gonna have the nerve
to talk to her.

14:12.225 --> 14:13.891
All right, man,
I'm out.

14:13.893 --> 14:15.509
All right, sweet.
Text me when you get home.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.461
Yeah.
See you.

14:26.521 --> 14:28.606
You know how many Ashleys
there are in downtown Boston?

14:28.608 --> 14:30.408
Too many Ashleys--
that's how many Ashleys.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.026
And the only thing I have
to track her down

14:32.028 --> 14:33.694
is she has a penchant
for bunnies?

14:33.696 --> 14:36.781
So, I'm pulling
receipts from local pet shops.

14:36.783 --> 14:39.200
Nothing crosses. And anyway,
even if she likes bunnies,

14:39.202 --> 14:40.534
it doesn't mean
she owns bunnies.

14:40.536 --> 14:42.787
I like unicorns.
I don't have any unicorns.

14:42.789 --> 14:45.756
I feel like I'm on a trail
led by wild geese and bunnies.

14:45.758 --> 14:47.341
What about Scott's
cell phone?

14:47.343 --> 14:49.677
He probably put Ashley's number
in it before he died.

14:49.679 --> 14:51.662
Yeah, that phone broke
during the struggle.

14:51.664 --> 14:54.967
I searched his cloud server,
but his contacts hadn't updated yet.

14:54.968 --> 14:55.968
We need to find her, Penelope.

14:55.993 --> 14:57.701
Ashley might be
able to identify the unsub,

14:57.702 --> 14:59.235
which means
she could be at risk, too.

14:59.237 --> 15:01.448
I know. I--you know what?

15:01.449 --> 15:03.461
Send me that broken cell phone.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.108
I may be able to pull data
from the device itself.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.909
And in the meantime,
forward Delfino's calls to us.

15:06.911 --> 15:09.044
If she tries him,
we'll be able to talk to her.

15:09.046 --> 15:11.997
Smart thinking, sensei.
Routing it now.

15:15.085 --> 15:17.953
Delfino put up a struggle,
but there was nothing he could do.

15:17.955 --> 15:19.221
Killer had all the leverage.

15:19.223 --> 15:21.807
Can you tell what kind
of garrote was used?

15:21.809 --> 15:22.958
It varies.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.460
First was fishing line,
then picture wire.

15:25.462 --> 15:27.663
Now some kind of cable.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.132
All common household items.

15:30.134 --> 15:32.735
I'd say he's definitely
making the weapons himself.

15:32.737 --> 15:34.737
From the looks of it,
learning quickly.

15:34.739 --> 15:36.655
Each wire was stronger
than the last.

15:36.657 --> 15:38.157
There's something else.

15:38.159 --> 15:40.276
He's cut a lock of hair
off every victim.

15:40.278 --> 15:45.331
Something tells me that's more
than an act of depersonalization.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.083
He wants to remember
these men

15:48.085 --> 15:50.369
and what he did to them.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.339
Anything yet?

15:53.341 --> 15:54.340
Nothing.

15:54.342 --> 15:56.375
Typical asshat.

15:56.377 --> 15:57.993
He's not, though.

15:57.995 --> 16:00.479
How many times has a guy
said he'd call and didn't?

16:00.481 --> 16:01.496
Too many.

16:01.498 --> 16:03.165
He wasn't like that.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.166
You weren't there.

16:04.168 --> 16:06.435
Call him.

16:06.437 --> 16:08.170
I can't.

16:08.172 --> 16:10.973
You don't have
his number.

16:10.975 --> 16:13.726
That's how sure I was
he would call.

16:13.728 --> 16:15.311
Rookie mistake.

16:15.313 --> 16:17.529
We're out of wine.

16:17.531 --> 16:19.148
Told you we should've got
another bottle.

16:19.150 --> 16:20.900
We can always get more.

16:20.902 --> 16:23.118
Not this late.
There's a killer on the street.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.488
Oh, yeah, I saw something
about that posted on campus.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.491
Just keep your focus.

16:29.493 --> 16:32.328
Look out, one's coming.

16:32.330 --> 16:33.329
All right, uh--

16:33.331 --> 16:34.997
there's one in the rafters.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.832
Oh, crap, I missed.

16:39.219 --> 16:40.836
Flank left. Flank left!

16:40.838 --> 16:43.138
I'm trying,
but Terrido's on my ass.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.640
I got him in my sights.

16:44.642 --> 16:46.475
So shoot him already
or I'm toast.

16:46.477 --> 16:48.260
Hold on one sec.

16:48.262 --> 16:49.561
And now I'm dead.

16:49.563 --> 16:51.146
But so is Terrido.
And we win.

16:51.148 --> 16:52.681
Good for us.
I'm still dead.

16:52.683 --> 16:54.850
The needs of many,
my friend.

16:54.852 --> 16:56.986
So I'm collateral damage.

16:56.988 --> 16:58.354
No, you can't think
of it that way, Jake.

16:58.356 --> 17:00.722
You're on the Sox
and you just hit a sacrifice fly.

17:00.724 --> 17:03.275
Yeah, I'll show you
who the sacrifice is gonna be.

17:06.497 --> 17:09.164
Uh-oh. Looks like your brother
is about to bust you on his PSP.

17:09.165 --> 17:11.337
Nah, he won't be back
for another hour.

17:11.362 --> 17:12.419
We can play one more round.

17:12.420 --> 17:14.086
Then who's there
with you?

17:14.088 --> 17:17.122
No one. Why?
Can you sneak out?

17:17.124 --> 17:20.009
Jake, there's
someone behind you.

17:21.962 --> 17:22.962
What are you--

17:23.931 --> 17:25.914
Colin!
Jake?

17:25.915 --> 17:27.933
Mom! Help! Help!

17:27.935 --> 17:30.185
Mom! Jake's in trouble! Hurry!

17:44.950 --> 17:47.483
A friend called it in.
He lives down the street.

17:47.921 --> 17:51.573
What kind of mission
involves killing a teenage boy?

17:51.575 --> 17:54.376
Normally I would say
this points to a devolution

17:54.378 --> 17:55.927
in the unsub's psyche.

17:55.929 --> 17:57.329
He killed Jake
in his own home.

17:57.331 --> 17:59.865
It's the first time
he's been inside. Why?

17:59.867 --> 18:01.933
We've been canvassing
the area pretty heavily.

18:01.935 --> 18:04.553
Maybe he's adapting to
increased police activity.

18:04.555 --> 18:06.638
He's a low-risk victim
killed in his home.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.007
It feels like the unsub
knew he would be alone.

18:09.009 --> 18:11.309
So he's not just stalking
Jake, but his family, too.

18:11.311 --> 18:13.311
As well as all
his other victims.

18:13.313 --> 18:14.646
He can't be everywhere
at once.

18:14.648 --> 18:17.616
Maybe he's been planning
this longer than we thought.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.619
The time between kills
is getting shorter.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.520
But there's no indication
that he's deriving

18:22.522 --> 18:24.289
increased pleasure
from them.

18:24.291 --> 18:25.798
Well, it would make sense
if he's feeling pressure

18:25.823 --> 18:27.359
from an outside agency.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.828
Maybe he's got a deadline.

18:34.984 --> 18:38.303
You're sure you didn't
catch a glimpse of him?

18:38.305 --> 18:40.589
Just movement
in the background.

18:40.591 --> 18:43.608
I tried to warn
Jake, but...

18:43.610 --> 18:46.478
Did Jake see who was there?
Did he say anything to you?

18:46.480 --> 18:47.429
He saw him.

18:47.431 --> 18:49.347
I mean, the guy
was right there.

18:49.349 --> 18:52.083
And Jake was so scared.

18:52.085 --> 18:56.054
I can't get his face
out of my head.

18:56.056 --> 18:58.056
It's ok.

18:58.058 --> 19:01.443
I just have
one more question.

19:01.445 --> 19:03.695
Do you think
you can handle that?

19:03.697 --> 19:05.197
Yeah.

19:09.168 --> 19:11.203
Ok.

19:11.205 --> 19:13.571
Did Jake seem like
he recognized

19:13.573 --> 19:15.707
the man in his house?

19:25.935 --> 19:27.919
What are you--

19:27.921 --> 19:29.421
Colin!

19:29.423 --> 19:31.189
Yeah.

19:31.191 --> 19:33.141
Yeah, he knew him.

19:33.143 --> 19:36.144
And I could see it
on his face.

19:36.146 --> 19:38.480
But he didn't say
who it was.

19:38.482 --> 19:40.256
Just because you recognize
someone

19:40.281 --> 19:42.034
doesn't necessarily
mean you know them.

19:42.035 --> 19:43.869
The man could simply
be someone that Jake

19:43.871 --> 19:45.871
routinely passes
on the street.

19:45.873 --> 19:48.740
Whoever he is,
we're gonna get him.

19:48.742 --> 19:50.208
Ok?

19:50.210 --> 19:51.793
Ok.

19:55.798 --> 19:58.449
Agent Jareau?

19:58.451 --> 20:00.585
Have you ever been shot?

20:00.587 --> 20:02.754
Why do you ask?

20:02.756 --> 20:06.457
I just can't stop thinking
about how it felt.

20:08.060 --> 20:11.980
Did it hurt a lot
when Jake died?

20:11.982 --> 20:15.567
You don't need
to worry about that.

20:15.569 --> 20:17.669
Jake wasn't shot.

20:17.671 --> 20:21.323
Then what was the flash?

20:29.999 --> 20:32.200
What are you--

20:35.805 --> 20:38.156
the unsub we're looking for
is a dangerous voyeur

20:38.158 --> 20:40.926
who feeds off the thrill of knowing
his victims can't see him.

20:40.928 --> 20:42.210
Typically voyeurs
are nonviolent

20:42.212 --> 20:43.845
and content
to remain bystanders.

20:43.847 --> 20:45.180
This one is different.

20:45.182 --> 20:47.182
He's on a mission
that includes taking action.

20:47.184 --> 20:49.601
And in that mission he didn't
hesitate to kill a teenage boy.

20:49.603 --> 20:52.337
Anyone who stands between
him and his goal is at risk.

20:52.339 --> 20:54.472
We believe
he's documenting his work.

20:54.474 --> 20:56.387
He's taking pictures
and collects personal

20:56.412 --> 20:59.725
connections to his victims--
their wallets and their hair.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.560
It's important to him
to have proof of what he's doing.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.346
Voyeurs like to create
fantasies in their heads

21:05.348 --> 21:07.632
of what the objects of their
obsession should be like.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.652
He creates a character
identity instead of a reality.

21:10.654 --> 21:13.438
And when a person
steps outside of the parameters

21:13.440 --> 21:16.024
that the unsub has set
for them, he strikes.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.243
This unsub appears
to be triggered by males

21:18.245 --> 21:21.696
acting on what he perceives
to be character flaws.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.082
Seemingly innocuous
infractions to us

21:24.084 --> 21:26.618
are magnified
in the unsub's psychosis.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.986
Based on the planning
and sophistication of the kills,

21:28.988 --> 21:31.089
we believe that he's in
his late 30s or 40s.

21:31.091 --> 21:32.823
The geographic profile
tells us this unsub

21:32.825 --> 21:34.992
is not only dumping
his victims downtown,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.294
he's hunting there, too.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.429
So this is where
we need to redouble our efforts.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.997
Go building to building,
door to door.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.799
This guy's
a fly on the wall.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.469
He's able to learn secrets
without anyone realizing he's there.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.171
He'll have a job that
involves very little social interaction,

21:47.173 --> 21:48.839
but it puts him
in a position

21:48.841 --> 21:50.775
where he can observe
others unnoticed.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.810
So we should look at
service workers,

21:52.812 --> 21:53.978
groundskeepers,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.613
anyone paid to be invisible.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.565
And we need
to move quickly.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.684
This unsub is approaching
some sort of perceived deadline.

21:59.686 --> 22:03.154
The closer it gets, the more erratic
and dangerous he'll become.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.489
Thank you.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.308
Hello?

22:24.393 --> 22:26.711
Oh. Can I help you,
Ms. Fouladi?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.146
Hey, Nick.
I was wondering

22:28.148 --> 22:29.764
if I could take a look
at your guest log.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.316
A friend of mine
came over the other night

22:31.318 --> 22:32.817
and I lost
his contact information.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.652
I was hoping
you might have it.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.187
Oh, well,
let's take a look.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.322
What was his name?

22:37.324 --> 22:39.941
Scott.
Scott Delfino.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.526
Scott Delfino.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.361
Hmm. I'm not seeing it.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.746
You sure that's his name?

22:44.748 --> 22:46.397
Yes.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.066
Oh, you know what?
This is only going back to yesterday.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.535
Looks like the old sheets
have been filed.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.586
And where would those be?

22:51.588 --> 22:53.671
In a box
up in our storage attic.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.740
Tanner, our night guy,
usually handles all of our paperwork.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.960
I'm pretty sure he can grab those for you
once he finishes his rounds.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.130
Is there any chance
I could take a look right now? Please?

23:02.132 --> 23:03.798
It's important.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.300
I'm running kind of late,
but, um...

23:06.302 --> 23:07.802
Tell you what.

23:10.105 --> 23:13.107
Ah. Give this to Tanner
when you're done.

23:13.109 --> 23:14.776
Deal. Thanks.

23:14.778 --> 23:16.761
Have a good night.
You, too.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.031
Talk to me,
baby girl.

23:20.033 --> 23:22.066
You better get ready
to get down on one knee,

23:22.068 --> 23:24.152
'cause this B.G. boo
just earned herself

23:24.154 --> 23:25.570
one hell of a diamond.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.604
What'd you find?

23:26.606 --> 23:28.873
Scott Delfino's phone
is a Hotch mess--

23:28.875 --> 23:30.458
hot mess--
you know what I mean.

23:30.460 --> 23:34.162
Data scrambled like
a Denver omelet on a Sunday morning.

23:34.164 --> 23:37.448
I can feel those smoldering
get-to-the-point stares from here.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.949
So I will.

23:38.951 --> 23:42.303
If the name Ashley
is on Scott's phone, I can't find it.

23:42.305 --> 23:44.589
Penelope, this is sounding
more like cubic zirconia.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.724
Bite your pretty tongue.
I didn't stop at the first rejection.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.459
I did what you guys did.
I profiled the guy.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.928
Scotty is a ladies' man.
Gets a lot of names and numbers,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.597
gotta keep track
of them all.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.298
What's a player
to do, playa?

23:54.300 --> 23:55.983
He gave her a nickname.

23:55.985 --> 23:58.019
Baby girl's already taken.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.021
But Bunny wasn't.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.138
Tell me you got a number.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.024
Of course I did.
Now so do you.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.826
Sending it now.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.663
Box.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.220
Which box?

24:45.033 --> 24:46.617
Hello?

25:25.909 --> 25:28.860
I really wish
you hadn't seen that.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.365
No.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.703
No.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.905
Uhh!

25:41.874 --> 25:43.124
Help!

25:44.359 --> 25:46.260
Someone!

25:49.849 --> 25:51.883
Wait! Shh!

25:55.587 --> 25:57.271
Please! Please, no!

25:57.273 --> 26:00.090
Let me go! Please!

26:00.092 --> 26:03.444
Aah!

26:31.720 --> 26:33.970
He killed a woman
this time.

26:33.972 --> 26:36.556
And she's also the first
one he covered up.

26:36.558 --> 26:37.808
This is remorse.

26:37.810 --> 26:39.876
She wasn't
part of the plan.

26:39.878 --> 26:41.728
Which explains
why he moved the body.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.046
She wasn't killed here.

26:43.048 --> 26:44.514
And the garrote
was used postmortem.

26:44.516 --> 26:46.243
C.O.D. appears to be
blunt force trauma

26:46.268 --> 26:47.649
to the back of the head.

26:48.187 --> 26:50.687
He didn't do a good job
of covering this up.

26:50.689 --> 26:54.157
He's panicking. We find where she
was killed, we find him.

26:54.159 --> 26:56.576
Except no one even knows
what her name is.

26:56.578 --> 26:59.329
No I.D. Just a phone.

26:59.331 --> 27:01.064
One unheard message.

27:01.066 --> 27:03.834
Hi, my name is Derek Morgan
with the FBI.

27:03.836 --> 27:06.870
I'm trying to locate
a woman, first name Ashley.

27:06.872 --> 27:08.171
It's extremely important.

27:08.173 --> 27:09.572
This is Ashley.

27:09.574 --> 27:11.374
Her name is Ashley Fouladi.

27:11.376 --> 27:13.043
She's a grad student at B.C.

27:13.045 --> 27:16.046
Bills, including rent and phone, are
in her father's name.

27:16.048 --> 27:17.080
That's why
we couldn't find her.

27:17.082 --> 27:18.448
You got an address,
Garcia?

27:18.450 --> 27:20.416
Yeah. 2410 Boylston Street.

27:20.418 --> 27:22.185
Boylston Street.

27:22.187 --> 27:23.854
That's where
Colin Kirkland lives,

27:23.856 --> 27:25.972
the boy who witnessed
the attack on Jake Preston.

27:25.974 --> 27:27.774
Right, they're neighbors.
Same building, different floor.

27:27.776 --> 27:31.895
Ashley wasn't planned,
but Scotty, the guy she was with, was.

27:31.897 --> 27:34.364
Right. And it wasn't Ashley's
neighbor Colin who s targeted,

27:34.366 --> 27:36.266
it was Jake,
the boy he was with.

27:36.268 --> 27:37.767
This unsub isn't stalking
the people he kills,

27:37.769 --> 27:39.569
he's stalking the people
that live in that building.

27:39.571 --> 27:43.273
All of hs victims must have interacted
with someone residing there.

27:44.876 --> 27:47.610
So, how does he choose
who he kills?

27:47.612 --> 27:48.879
All right, well,
let's look at it.

27:48.881 --> 27:50.881
Ashley comes home
with a womanizer

27:50.883 --> 27:53.049
who the unsub then killed.

27:53.051 --> 27:56.503
Colin was playing with a video
game he wasn't supposed to have.

27:56.505 --> 27:59.789
The unsub killed the boy
who gave it to him.

27:59.791 --> 28:01.925
He's targeting
bad influences.

28:01.927 --> 28:02.976
He sees himself
as a protector.

28:02.978 --> 28:04.227
Or as a parent.

28:05.229 --> 28:07.681
He's keeping the people
under his own roof safe.

28:07.683 --> 28:09.766
Which mean he most likely
suffered a past loss.

28:09.768 --> 28:11.935
One he blames himself for.

28:19.961 --> 28:21.828
Agents.
What can I do for you?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.865
One of your residents,
Ashley Fouladi,

28:24.867 --> 28:26.333
was killed tonight.

28:26.335 --> 28:29.319
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

28:29.321 --> 28:31.538
Oh, wow.

28:31.540 --> 28:32.923
That's horrible.

28:32.925 --> 28:35.876
Did you happen to notice
anything strange this evening?

28:35.878 --> 28:37.844
No. But I just got here.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.679
Our night guy had
a family emergency,

28:39.681 --> 28:41.497
so I just got
called back in.

28:41.499 --> 28:43.049
Did you interact with her
earlier today?

28:43.051 --> 28:44.551
Was she with anyone?

28:44.553 --> 28:46.186
No one was with her,

28:46.188 --> 28:48.688
but she did ask me
about our visitor logs.

28:48.690 --> 28:51.274
She was trying to find
some guy's number

28:51.276 --> 28:52.809
and I just sent her
up to our storage room.

28:52.811 --> 28:54.110
Can you show us?

28:54.112 --> 28:55.395
Yeah, yeah, of course.

28:55.397 --> 28:56.846
Right this way.

29:12.196 --> 29:13.663
It's clear.

29:17.468 --> 29:19.719
Somebody's been
living up here.

29:19.721 --> 29:21.285
Looks like he's making
some sort of collage

29:21.310 --> 29:23.435
or scrapbook or something.

30:00.761 --> 30:03.380
This guy's got a view
of the entire courtyard

30:03.382 --> 30:04.681
and a half a dozen
apartments.

30:04.683 --> 30:06.383
He can see who's
coming and going all day long.

30:06.385 --> 30:09.135
Look at this.
It's a live feed.

30:13.391 --> 30:16.893
So who else
is he watching?

30:16.895 --> 30:18.728
That's Tanner.

30:20.064 --> 30:22.065
The guy
I'm covering for.

30:28.939 --> 30:32.608
His name is Tanner Johnson
and life has not been kind.

30:32.610 --> 30:34.610
He lost a child,
didn't he?

30:34.612 --> 30:36.579
Yeah. Last year.
A 10-year-old son Jeremy.

30:36.581 --> 30:40.000
According to reports, Jeremy
was playing with a friend,

30:40.002 --> 30:41.418
they were like
fake wrestling,

30:41.420 --> 30:44.471
when Tanner,
a free-lance photographer/

30:44.473 --> 30:46.256
slash/nighttimdoore

30:46.258 --> 30:48.425
got a call,
left the room to take it.

30:48.427 --> 30:50.577
When he returned,
his son was unconscious.

30:50.579 --> 30:52.095
The friend was trying
to revive him

30:52.097 --> 30:54.814
from a chokehold
gone horribly wrong.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.435
His son was strangled.
That's why he uses a garrote.

30:58.437 --> 31:00.487
Jeremy was on life support
for a few days, but he died.

31:00.489 --> 31:04.024
Tanner blames himself.
He stopped watching for a minute

31:04.026 --> 31:05.308
and he lost his son.

31:05.310 --> 31:07.077
He hasn't stopped
watching since.

31:07.079 --> 31:09.145
The grief must have
consumed him.

31:09.147 --> 31:11.647
That's a hell a stressor,
but what triggered the murders?

31:11.649 --> 31:13.616
Garcia, what happened
to Tanner's wife?

31:13.618 --> 31:14.951
Did the marriage survive?

31:14.953 --> 31:16.953
Uh...

31:18.072 --> 31:20.490
No. She kicked him out
two months ago,

31:20.492 --> 31:22.258
right before
the killing started.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.211
So he loses his child
and then his wife and home.

31:25.213 --> 31:27.597
It's enough to make
anyone unstable.

31:27.599 --> 31:29.099
Add guilt to that
and it's all too much.

31:29.101 --> 31:30.600
He dissociated.

31:30.602 --> 31:32.102
Paternal transference.

31:32.104 --> 31:35.021
He claimed the residents
of his apartment building as his family.

31:35.023 --> 31:38.224
But we're missing something.
Why is he documenting all of this?

31:38.226 --> 31:39.693
We profiled
he's running out of time.

31:39.695 --> 31:41.844
The book must have
something to do with that.

31:41.846 --> 31:43.697
Oh, snap.
What is it, Garcia?

31:43.699 --> 31:47.067
Hannah, Tanner's wife,
she's pregnant.

31:48.152 --> 31:50.853
That's who he's
watching online.

31:50.855 --> 31:53.189
Garcia,
when is the baby due?

31:53.191 --> 31:55.458
The baby's due...

31:55.460 --> 31:56.876
Yesterday.

31:58.245 --> 32:01.498
Matt? I think it's time.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.384
Your nephew's getting antsy.

32:09.507 --> 32:12.342
Don't worry. I'm home.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.877
And when the baby comes,

32:14.879 --> 32:18.348
we're gonna be
a family again.

32:40.512 --> 32:42.095
He's not picking up.

32:42.097 --> 32:44.764
He's not going to.
He's got what he wants.

32:46.100 --> 32:49.102
I am checking Hannah's
social media footprint now.

32:49.104 --> 32:51.605
It looks like her brother Matt is staying
with her until the baby's born.

32:51.607 --> 32:52.639
I'm sending you his number.

32:52.641 --> 32:54.407
Don't bother, Garcia.
I see him.

32:54.409 --> 32:55.942
Where?

32:58.996 --> 33:01.081
Oh.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.833
Oh, God. God.

33:03.835 --> 33:05.952
You killed him? Why?

33:05.954 --> 33:06.920
Don't worry about him.

33:06.922 --> 33:08.455
Ohh!
Sit down!

33:08.457 --> 33:11.424
He's not gonna hurt
Hannah or the baby, will he?

33:11.426 --> 33:15.345
Not while she's pregnant.
He has to keep the child safe.

33:15.347 --> 33:16.663
And after?

33:20.551 --> 33:23.553
Look at me. Look at me.
We're gonna be a family again.

33:23.555 --> 33:25.889
No, we can't be a family.

33:25.891 --> 33:27.273
It didn't work.

33:27.275 --> 33:29.292
But it will this time.
It will,

33:29.294 --> 33:30.894
'cause I've changed!

33:30.896 --> 33:33.179
I've noticed.

33:33.181 --> 33:34.981
I did everything you said.

33:34.983 --> 33:38.985
And I'm stronger now. I--
I can keep our family safe.

33:38.987 --> 33:40.453
If you want to protect us,

33:40.455 --> 33:45.075
I need you to get me
to a hospital.

33:45.077 --> 33:48.495
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

33:48.497 --> 33:50.413
Please.

33:50.415 --> 33:52.532
Please.

34:02.811 --> 34:04.511
No, no. I can't take you
to the hospital.

34:04.513 --> 34:06.262
Something could happen
to the baby.

34:06.264 --> 34:09.649
Oh, God! That's exactly
why have to get me to a hospital.

34:09.650 --> 34:13.018
No. No. Something
could go wrong.

34:13.021 --> 34:15.071
Oh, God.
And it won't here?

34:15.072 --> 34:17.273
Here...

34:17.275 --> 34:20.326
Here...
I can help you.

34:20.328 --> 34:22.245
You can't help me!

34:22.246 --> 34:24.164
You're too weak!

34:24.166 --> 34:25.782
You've always been weak.

34:27.452 --> 34:28.784
Weak.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.255
You won't say that
after you've seen this.

34:35.877 --> 34:38.545
Look. See? Look.

34:38.547 --> 34:41.965
Tanner thinks his book proves
he can take care of the baby.

34:41.967 --> 34:44.384
And if she rejects that,
he could unravel even more.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.085
Uh-huh,
and what happens then?

34:46.087 --> 34:48.271
No one will be safe,
not even the child.

34:50.641 --> 34:52.275
Look, look.

34:52.277 --> 34:53.926
This is Colin.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.195
Colin, see,
he's a good boy, really.

34:55.197 --> 34:56.763
Till he met
this kid, Jake.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.982
But I took care of him.

34:58.984 --> 35:00.150
Yeah.

35:00.152 --> 35:02.786
And this man, Scott.

35:02.788 --> 35:04.991
Ok? I'd seen him
at the building before.

35:04.992 --> 35:06.219
You see, Ashley--

35:06.244 --> 35:09.460
Ashley thought she was the first
girl he seduced there,

35:09.461 --> 35:11.995
but she wasn't. I made sure
she was the last.

35:11.997 --> 35:14.631
What is this?

35:14.633 --> 35:17.083
This is proof.

35:17.085 --> 35:19.836
This is proof that I can protect
our new baby.

35:23.924 --> 35:26.676
This is proof.

35:26.678 --> 35:28.261
Yeah.

35:29.146 --> 35:30.630
Proof that I'm never,

35:30.632 --> 35:34.350
never gonna let anything
or anyone ever hurt him.

35:34.352 --> 35:36.186
You're...

35:36.188 --> 35:37.804
Insane.

35:38.639 --> 35:39.989
No.

35:43.612 --> 35:47.947
Aah! Aah! Aah!

35:47.949 --> 35:49.415
Put it down.

35:49.417 --> 35:51.451
You can't be in here.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.786
Tanner, think about
what you're doing.

35:52.788 --> 35:54.120
You don't want to hurt
your baby, do you?

35:54.122 --> 35:55.322
That's what happened
to Jeremy.

35:55.323 --> 35:56.456
Go away! Just get out of here!

35:56.458 --> 35:57.757
Aah!

35:59.159 --> 36:00.627
Hannah, how far apart
are you contractions?

36:00.629 --> 36:01.628
They're constant!

36:01.630 --> 36:03.162
The baby's coming now.

36:03.164 --> 36:04.681
Look, man, your baby
is about to be born.

36:04.683 --> 36:06.432
Now, we want to help you, but you
need to put that weapon down.

36:06.434 --> 36:08.968
No! This is my child.
I'm not leaving it.

36:14.859 --> 36:16.442
Ohh!

36:21.148 --> 36:24.551
Ohh! Aah!

36:27.222 --> 36:29.522
Hannah, I need you
to breathe deeply. Breathe deeply.

36:29.524 --> 36:30.623
Oh, my God.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.292
Hannah,
I need you to start pushing...

36:32.294 --> 36:34.694
We need medics to Hannah
Johnson's residence right away.

36:34.696 --> 36:35.995
They're already
on the way.

36:35.997 --> 36:37.080
I can't.

36:37.082 --> 36:38.798
Yes, you can, baby,
just like with Jeremy.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.250
1, 2, 3--

36:40.252 --> 36:41.384
This is not helping.

36:41.386 --> 36:42.802
Tanner,
you need to let her go.

36:42.804 --> 36:44.220
The stress isn't good
for the baby.

36:44.222 --> 36:46.589
If Hannah doesn't start pushing now
we could lose the child.

36:46.591 --> 36:48.842
I have to watch him.
I have to keep him safe.

36:48.844 --> 36:50.226
Like you did with Ashley?

36:51.428 --> 36:53.429
That was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

36:53.431 --> 36:54.931
I know you didn't.
Accidents happen.

36:54.933 --> 36:58.101
What happened with Jeremy
was an accident, right?

36:58.103 --> 37:02.071
If I'd have been there
I could have helped him.

37:02.073 --> 37:05.057
Aah!

37:08.245 --> 37:09.729
Guys, something's wrong.

37:09.731 --> 37:11.381
The umbilical cord's wrapped
around the baby's throat.

37:11.383 --> 37:12.415
No.
What?

37:12.417 --> 37:13.666
Well, Reid, do something.

37:13.668 --> 37:16.786
I need something to cut
the cord with, quickly!

37:16.788 --> 37:18.872
Use these.

37:18.874 --> 37:20.540
No! No!

37:20.542 --> 37:22.375
Don't worry, Hannah,
your baby's doing fine,

37:22.377 --> 37:24.594
but you need to keep
pushing. Ready?

37:24.596 --> 37:26.129
Medics on the way.
We can't risk moving her now.

37:26.131 --> 37:27.413
We'll have to deliver
the baby here.

37:27.415 --> 37:28.698
Oh, God!

37:28.700 --> 37:31.718
Squeeze her hand
as hard as you can and push.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.919
Oh, I can't. I can't.

37:32.921 --> 37:33.937
Yes, you can.
You're doing great.

37:33.939 --> 37:35.104
I need to see this.

37:35.106 --> 37:36.255
You're doing great.

37:36.257 --> 37:38.057
I can see the head.
Keep pushing. Keep pushing.

37:38.059 --> 37:39.359
No!
You've seen enough.

37:39.361 --> 37:42.896
Keep pushing, all right?
Keep pushing.

37:46.601 --> 37:49.202
Oh, God!

38:16.847 --> 38:20.800
"The most important thing that
parents can teach their children

38:20.802 --> 38:24.270
is how to get along
without them."

38:24.272 --> 38:25.939
Frank Clark.

38:25.941 --> 38:27.523
And to Dr. Spencer Reid,

38:27.525 --> 38:31.194
who may be adding M.D. to an
already impressive list of credentials.

38:31.196 --> 38:34.781
And to Spencer Johnson,
may he prove to be the child prodigy

38:34.783 --> 38:36.249
like his namesake.

38:36.251 --> 38:38.701
How on earth
did you know what to do?

38:38.703 --> 38:41.587
When JJ was pregnant with Henry,
I memorized the delivery manuals

38:41.589 --> 38:43.923
just in case she went
into labor in the field.

38:43.925 --> 38:45.708
I have to admit
the practical application

38:45.710 --> 38:48.094
did not quite
live up to the theory.

38:48.096 --> 38:49.846
No, you were great, Spence.

38:49.848 --> 38:51.331
Thanks. This night is
not about me, though.

38:51.356 --> 38:52.599
To Dave Rossi.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.217
Oh, I still can't believe
you guys did this.

38:54.219 --> 38:56.719
We wanted to make sure
you had one last proper goodbye.

38:56.721 --> 38:58.343
Mm-hmm. And I may 
or may not have posted on

38:58.368 --> 38:59.723
the Quantico message boards

38:59.724 --> 39:01.107
that all the drinks
are on you tonight.

39:01.109 --> 39:02.809
And they are indeed,
thank you very much.

39:02.811 --> 39:05.011
Um, but that's not all.

39:05.013 --> 39:07.480
I don't believe that, uh, any
of the members of this team

39:07.482 --> 39:09.148
have heard you sing.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.084
Next up is David Rossi.

39:11.086 --> 39:12.518
That was intentional.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.703
Next up is David Rossi.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.541
Dave, get your ass up here
and sing us out already.

39:18.543 --> 39:20.026
And, look, it's in your key.

39:20.028 --> 39:22.528
Yeah, Q squared.

39:22.530 --> 39:24.464
Whoo!

39:24.466 --> 39:26.749
Alrighty.
Oww!

39:26.751 --> 39:29.052
To all the great memories

39:29.054 --> 39:31.004
that have happened
within these walls,

39:31.006 --> 39:34.307
if you think I'm doing this
without backup, you're nuts.

39:34.309 --> 39:36.426
Come on, JJ, Reid, let's go.

39:37.729 --> 39:40.146
Derek!

39:40.148 --> 39:42.565
