<i>Previously on </i>Dynasty:

00:13.388 --> 00:15.724
This is the blackmail on Fallon
and Jeff Colby.

00:15.807 --> 00:19.019
You can walk away from me for good
or keep doing what you're so good at.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.270
Fire!

00:21.771 --> 00:23.523
-Michael!

00:23.606 --> 00:26.484
-Manuel. I babysit a lot.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.820
Everyone, this is Manuel, the new manny.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.239
I just looked in your room.
LB's not there.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.241
Where did you take Matthew?
Where is my son?

00:33.324 --> 00:37.203
Don't worry, baby.
Mommy's coming to find you.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.290
playing]

00:47.714 --> 00:51.301
I was coming up to the main house
for a nightcap... of milk

00:51.885 --> 00:53.720
when I learned that he was missing.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.389
I hope you have all of your men
on the case.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.183
The child is a Carrington.

00:58.266 --> 01:02.520
No, Fallon and I didn't see
or hear anything unusual last night.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.191
-We were in bed, asleep.
It was after hours.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.152
I had no idea the child
had been left unattended.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.905
I never would have left my post
if I'd been in charge.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.909
<i>-♪ All ringing a song ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Christmas ♪</i>

01:15.992 --> 01:19.245
<i>♪ Full of happy sound ♪</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:22.624
This is little Blake.
I took it just a few days ago.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.001
That nutjob Claudia Blaisdel
kidnapped him.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.088
-I know. You can't write this stuff.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.715
-Our son Hank.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.427
He left the baby on the doorstep
along with a note

01:34.511 --> 01:36.387
telling us how dangerous Claudia is.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.682
Sam and my other son
were planning on adopting him.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.936
Agent Harper, this woman
has a vendetta against my family.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.020
It's true.

01:44.312 --> 01:48.775
I found a photo of her
crashing our wedding in a hideous coat.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.318
I think she targeted my son.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.696
And I think she was the one
that shot my wife, Cristal,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.156
not Hank, like we thought.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.325
I don't know her,
but she's not a great mom.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.079
She left behind his favorite things:
his pacifier and his teddy.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.789
Put that in your report.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.875
Thank you, Nancy Drew,
but we'll take it from here.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.878
Look, respect to your windbreaker
and everything,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.547
but you have to trust us.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.925
Claudia has a case of the crazies,
and this baby is in jeopardy.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.177
Hey, Harper, former nanny just arrived.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.638
-Wilcox is handling it.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.058
-I'm so glad he's here.
-Ahem. I should probably go say hi.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.854
You know this is an investigation,
not a mixer, right?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.147
Do what you need to do.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.898
Just find this woman.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.026
-And find my grandson.
-Oh, don't worry.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.238
I have a unit setting up checkpoints
around the city perimeter.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.365
Likely Mrs. Blaisdel hasn't been able
to get far.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.121
You're safe now, Matthew.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.290
Mommy's got you.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.212
I promise you,

02:51.796 --> 02:55.592
those evil Carringtons are never gonna
take you away from me again.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.343
Yeah.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.180
Yeah.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.641
But I've only worked here for two days--

03:08.062 --> 03:08.897
Sam.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.066
-Thank you for coming back.
-Of course.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.029
I was just explaining
that after you released me,

03:16.112 --> 03:18.907
I checked on LB and I went straight home.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.367
You didn't see anyone strange
when you were leaving?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.202
-Just the usual staff.
-Manny...

03:23.286 --> 03:25.246
I don't know what I'm going to do.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.540
Steven's flying in from Paraguay tonight.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.543
-If anything has happened to LB, I just--
-Hey.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.838
Don't talk like that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.298
You must think I'm crazy.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.051
He's not even my baby.
I've barely gotten to know him.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.179
You're not crazy.
I studied family psych for a semester.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.181
The bond between father and son
can form quickly.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.267
Maybe I should go to your room
and talk with investigators.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.144
-Something might jog my memory.
-I'll take you.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.107
It's sweet of you to do this, Manny.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.985
Felt useless down there.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.239
Wish I could've been more help,
but I didn't hear anything last night.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.407
Well, we were both a little distracted.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.577
A lot distracted. Multiple times.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.914
Had to get in practice
before the honeymoon.

04:07.997 --> 04:11.167
Can you believe in two weeks we're gonna
be Mr. and Mrs. Fallon Carrington?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.336
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.631
Although some men do choose
to take the woman's name.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.967
No? Okay, fine. I'm still kidding. Maybe I should skip work today.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.638
Be here for the family,
help with the investigation.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
No. You worked too hard to get this job.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.101
I'm not having you jeopardize it
by skipping day two.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.062
-Yeah, but this is important.
-That's why the FBI is here.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.857
Claudia is probably out on the street
trying to sell the kid for a hot dog.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.734
They will find her.

04:37.944 --> 04:38.903
Okay.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.823
-I'll be home in time for dinner.
-You better be.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.492
It's the first Christmas Eve
as an official couple.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.910
I don't want anything to spoil it.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.414
Except the usual stuff
that ruins every holiday here.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.128
I can't believe you never told us
this baby was left by Hank.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.922
Yes, Alexis, I'm curious,
why lie about that?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.216
Does she need to be here?
This is a family matter.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.303
You said there was a note.
What exactly did it say again?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.804
Something to the effect of:

05:04.887 --> 05:08.391
"My name is Matthew.
Claudia is my mother, and she's crazy."

05:08.474 --> 05:11.686
You march in ten times a day
telling us useless things,

05:11.769 --> 05:15.273
-but that you keep to yourself.
-Well, I didn't know who Claudia was.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.026
Look, when Hank left the baby
outside my trailer,

05:18.109 --> 05:21.529
I kept it a secret because I knew
that Blake would send him away.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.449
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing my grandson.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.493
-Now I find out it wasn't Hank's baby.
No.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.287
It's Matthew's.
Why did you lie to the FBI?

05:29.370 --> 05:32.081
The FBI is not gonna look for a woman
who's taken her own baby,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.750
especially when we don't have blood ties.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.670
Why wouldn't they look for the woman
who tried to kill you last Thanksgiving?

05:37.754 --> 05:39.339
Oh, Daddy didn't tell you?

05:39.422 --> 05:43.009
He didn't report it to the cops.
He paid to lock her up in a loony bin.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.511
-Don't worry. They had a craft room.
I can't believe it.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.930
The child I was planning on raising
belongs to Claudia.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.474
He belongs to you and Steven.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.643
Claudia is not equipped to raise a child.
She's a murderer.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.479
You don't know she killed Cristal.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.565
It makes sense. Cristal was killed
with a gun from my gun room.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.651
-Claudia has broken in there.
-You'd think we'd change the locks.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.905
Maybe Claudia and Hank are in cahoots.
She's not gonna get away from it.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.241
I'm gonna hire my own security team,
go on TV, and offer a reward.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.953
No, you are not.
You are gonna let the FBI do their job.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.915
-You're an emotional wreck.
-You don't know what you're talking about.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.374
-I have a plan.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.377
Because not too long ago,
I was kidnapped from this joint.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.631
If memory serves,
it was OG Cristal that had me found.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.217
She defied your plan
and the police were able to do their job.

06:24.634 --> 06:28.805
So, I will go see if Claudia has had
any communication with Matthew's family.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.766
I will get cops to cover security
at the gate.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.811
You never know if that lunatic
is gonna show up and try to kill us again.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.189
And nobody does anything
without going through me first. Got it?

06:47.615 --> 06:49.242
Happy Holidays.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.768
Yeah. I figured it was a long shot.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.979
If you hear from her,
will you let us know?

07:18.062 --> 07:18.896
Thank you.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.023
Well, I tracked down Matthew's parents,

07:21.107 --> 07:24.026
but they haven't heard
from their daughter-in-law in over a year.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.153
I made a few calls,

07:25.236 --> 07:27.947
one to the mental-health facility
where Claudia was being held.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.740
Don't tell me she checked back in.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.618
You were the last visitor she had
before she escaped.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.371
Oh. That.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.962
Well, I was gathering information
on you, actually.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.506
Some of your dirty deals.
I needed it to force you out of CA.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.967
You are unbelievable.
How could you go there

07:48.050 --> 07:48.968
Wait.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.598
Claudia told me Matthew owned an apartment
and it's where he kept his files.

07:53.681 --> 07:54.640
Did you get an address?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.727
I went there. It's by the airport.
Maybe Claudia has been hiding there.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.562
-I'm calling my security team.
-No.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.857
I am calling Agent Harper
and telling him to meet us there.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.401
We're doing this the right way for once,
remember?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.862
Legally. And filled with holiday spirit.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.074
Not too early to celebrate a moment
like this, am I right?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.659
I'm glad you came through.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.370
-I told you to trust me.
-Yeah, yeah.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.916
-We're good.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.293
I got every piece of blackmail
they had on us,

08:22.376 --> 08:26.255
including the escort's false testimony
that Fallon put her up to Max's death.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.674
Well, I guess your plan worked.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.553
You don't have to call your cousin Bobby.
Cops don't need to know about this.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.097
I'm not sure how
you were able to pull this off.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.767
-I'm just glad you did.
-Consider it your Christmas gift.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.938
Well, to the death of your alias,
Mike Jones.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.565
Oh, God. Mr. Jones.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.192
May he rest in peace.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.951
I didn't think Scrooge gave gifts.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.285
Oh, good.

08:56.369 --> 09:00.206
Cristal. I was just about to call
the house to ask them to send over a maid.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.624
But you'll do.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.378
Come on in. I need a finger
to help with the bow for Steven's gift.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.757
Not that finger. Cute, though.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.762
You must be looking forward to having
your family back together for Christmas.

09:14.845 --> 09:15.888
I am.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.267
We Carringtons have many, many traditions.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.770
I hope it won't make you feel
like too much of an interloper.

09:22.853 --> 09:26.566
I'll just remind myself that I have
many more Christmases ahead with Blake.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.778
Some people tie a string
around their finger so they won't forget.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.697
I have 10 carats.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.953
I assume you popped by for a reason?

09:39.370 --> 09:42.290
Just making sure you told the FBI
everything you know about that baby.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.834
-Well, of course I did.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.170
Seems there's more to the story
of his arrival than you're letting on.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.715
What on earth
are you blathering on about now?

09:50.798 --> 09:53.759
It's just, you mentioned
Hank left the baby in your trailer.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.430
But how would he know you were staying
in a trailer in the first place?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.432
Any chance you spoke
to each other before then?

09:59.515 --> 10:02.351
You know, I really don't have time
for this nonsense.

10:03.394 --> 10:07.273
You just call next time, and I'll
make sure I don't pick up the phone.

10:08.107 --> 10:08.941
Are you upset?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.612
Maybe because I'm getting close
to the truth?

10:13.237 --> 10:17.366
Or maybe because now that we know
that Claudia is tied to Hank

10:17.450 --> 10:19.619
and the FBI is looking for her,

10:20.119 --> 10:23.914
whatever secrets you're hiding
are bound to come out.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.919
No need to buy me anything for Christmas.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.840
I can't imagine a better gift
than watching the police take you away.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.010
Send a card signed "Ho, ho, ho."

10:36.510 --> 10:37.511
I'll know it's you.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.976
We're gonna need you both to stay back.
We have no idea if she's armed.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.605
Remember there's a baby in there.
Proceed with caution.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.689
On my count, okay?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.817
One, two... now.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.236
FBI!

10:57.073 --> 10:57.907
Clear.  Clear!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.293
-I was sure--

11:09.377 --> 11:12.880
If she was here, she's gone now.
Let's fall back, team. False alarm here.

11:12.963 --> 11:13.798
Copy.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.178
You happy now

11:20.262 --> 11:23.015
We lost her. My team would've been here
in half the time.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.309
-You don't know.
-What I know is, because of you, Claudia is in the wind. Again.

11:57.508 --> 12:02.221
Here you go, doll. But if that kid
starts screaming, you're out.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.057
-No refunds.
-Don't worry. He's sleep trained.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.685
And we're not staying very long.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.779
Stunning, aren't they?

12:19.447 --> 12:20.948
I try not to look too close.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.409
Easier to pretend I don't know
what truck they fell off of.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.578
Living ignorant is always wise, Michael.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.541
I must admit, it's nice to have someone
I really trust by my side.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.627
To think it was all just dumb luck
how you entered my life.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.837
Not exactly how I saw it.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.631
I wanted revenge on Max Van Kirk
for screwing me over,

12:37.715 --> 12:41.010
while you were trying to protect Fallon
from being blamed for Max's death.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.928
Funny how things work out, isn't it?

12:43.053 --> 12:45.890
Mm-hm. This is the last of the crates.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.810
Perfect. My first shipment out of Atlanta.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.689
Things must go smoothly, Michael.
I'm counting on you.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.983
Just tell me who and where,
and I'll get it done.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.943
You are to deliver all this

12:58.027 --> 13:00.154
to my shipping contact Nico
at this address.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.157
And in turn,
he will hand you a very large sum of cash,

13:03.866 --> 13:05.326
as in "$10 million" large.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.621
This guy is handing me millions in cash?
What if he tries to short me?

13:08.704 --> 13:10.915
You've proven you know
how to handle yourself.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.210
-This is a little something for you.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.879
Your cut of the deal.
Call it a token of good faith.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.839
You're giving me my take up front?

13:18.923 --> 13:22.718
I trust you. After all, you saved my life.
Plus, you have a wedding to plan.

13:22.801 --> 13:26.680
This will cover the bar tab and then some.
Nothing too big, of course.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.350
We don't want Fallon knowing
you're the one wearing the pants now.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.854
Thanks for the trust.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.026
I know money makes you feel good.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.322
You know, there's something else that...

13:44.615 --> 13:46.325
might make you feel good, too. Let's keep things business.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.664
For now.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.875
I do love a good tease.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
What the devil are you doing here?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.135
I'm just trying to get LB's things
in order.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.431
Have you seen his pacifier?
I could've sworn it was in here before.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.225
You're worried about his pacifier?

14:11.308 --> 14:13.727
He's gonna want it when he gets home.
It helps him sleep.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.062
Don't touch anything.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.940
This room is a crime scene,
and you're disturbing it.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.067
Relax. I'm trying to find his pacifier.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.070
Don't tell me to relax.
There's a child's life at stake.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.614
You're not the only one
that cares about him. I care, too.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.616
I find that very hard to believe.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.286
Especially having watched you
fawning over Manuel.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.539
"Fawning"? You're making a bigger deal
out of it than it needs to be.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.001
You have no idea the severity
of what could happen to that child.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.461
If you're not helping the situation,
you're hurting it.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.048
So, please, stay out of the way
and let the professionals handle it.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.763
I'll do whatever the FBI says,
but going on TV?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.390
Fallon said it was a bad idea.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.434
I'm telling you
it's the right thing to do.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.228
If there's a chance someone has seen her,
I wanna know.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.648
Well, it's just--
Look, I'm worried about the baby's safety.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.694
If Claudia feels hunted, she may take LB
and run from Atlanta for good.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.029
Sam.
Or worse.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.532
Sam, just try to understand.
-Yes, do try, Sam.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.869
I mean, I, for one,
think it's a wonderful idea, Blake.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.871
When you get to know Blake
as well as I do,

15:13.954 --> 15:17.583
you'll learn that, well,
he has great instincts about these things.

15:17.666 --> 15:18.667
Thank you, Alexis.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.337
In fact, I should join you on TV.

15:22.212 --> 15:25.174
I mean, after all,
we are appealing to the public for help,

15:25.257 --> 15:31.889
and, well, what would look better than
LB's grandparents united in their grief?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.477
You're still here?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.605
I thought you were picking up Dad
for Christmas Eve services.

15:40.064 --> 15:44.026
I am. Just taking care of a few things
before we're closed for the holidays.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.527
What are you doing?

15:45.819 --> 15:48.864
I came to pick up the damage report
from the smoke-bomb incident.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.034
-Bobby wanted a copy for the police file.
-Nothing helpful.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.166
They were able to track the serial numbers
on some of the smoke bombs.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.627
They were ordered
by some guy named Mike Jones.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.836
Mike Jones?

16:04.171 --> 16:05.464
-Yeah.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.510
But she said it's a common alias.
It might as well be "John Doe."

16:09.969 --> 16:13.097
Apparently, people don't use real names
when ordering illegal weapons.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.808
-Right.
-All right, I gotta run.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.812
-Yeah.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.648
-I just need a few more minutes.
-Fine. Don't be late.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.817
It's Dad's first Christmas
since he got home.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.695
-I want us together as a family.
-Of course.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.368
We're at the Carrington Manor,

16:34.451 --> 16:37.788
where the holiday season
has been interrupted by tragedy.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.999
With us today are Blake Carrington,

16:40.082 --> 16:44.044
along with the energy tycoon's first wife,
Alexis Carrington.

16:44.628 --> 16:48.382
Both are in a deep state of shock
over the disappearance of their grandson,

16:48.465 --> 16:51.135
which the FBI is calling a kidnapping.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.594
Mr. Carrington?

16:52.678 --> 16:53.554
Thank you.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.390
This is little Blake.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.685
Blake Carrington Jr., our grandchild.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.145
He's only a few months old,

17:01.228 --> 17:04.398
and we believe that last night,
he was kidnapped from his crib

17:04.481 --> 17:05.357
by this woman.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.902
Claudia Blaisdel has
serious mental-health issues,

17:08.986 --> 17:12.823
and therefore, she is a danger
to our child and to herself.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.409
All we want is for her
to get the proper care she needs

17:15.743 --> 17:18.162
and for our grandson
to be returned home safely.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.706
If you have any information
as to her whereabouts,

17:20.789 --> 17:23.459
please contact us immediately.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.628
I beg of you. Help us find our grandson.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.255
-We just want him--
-We--

17:29.423 --> 17:32.843
Well, Blake and I are no strangers
to this kind of tragedy.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.765
You see, almost 30 years ago,
we lost our firstborn son.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.975
His name was Adam.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.811
And we may have failed
to get him back then,

17:42.895 --> 17:46.190
but we will not let history repeat itself.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.235
We will never give up, Claudia.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.988
We will find you together.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.366
Our thoughts and prayers
are with the Carrington family

17:56.450 --> 17:57.868
during this time of crisis.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.455
Reporting live from the Carrington Manor.
Back to you in the studio.

18:01.997 --> 18:06.293
All I'm asking is that you confirm this
prescription belonged to Claudia Blaisdel.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.171
Crazy Pants was smart enough
to scratch her name off the bottle.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.549
It's policy and the law
not to give out patient information.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.302
Listen... C. Smith, is it?

18:15.385 --> 18:18.639
It's a beautiful name. Ever notice
a plaque at the end of the hall

18:18.722 --> 18:20.224
that says "Carrington Family Wing"?

18:20.307 --> 18:23.435
-I'm guessing you haven't, but that's me.
-You should get a name tag.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.563
This is a matter of life and death.
Time is of the essence.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.649
-Then call the police.
-I would,

18:28.732 --> 18:32.402
but I'm thinking I need a more
credible lead before I call them again.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.322
I am just kindly asking
that you be my credible lead.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.032
Will you

18:39.243 --> 18:40.702
Can I at least have a phone number?

18:40.786 --> 18:44.123
<i>Which is why I'm offering $100,000</i>
<i>reward for information...</i>

18:44.206 --> 18:45.332
<i>...that leads to her arrest.</i>

18:45.415 --> 18:47.793
<i>If you have seen this woman</i>
<i>or know where she is,</i>

18:47.876 --> 18:50.045
<i>please contact us immediately.</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:52.673
<i>Help me find my grandson.</i>

18:52.756 --> 18:54.591
<i>Our grandson.</i>

18:54.967 --> 18:56.135
I'm gonna kill him.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.850
-I was done listening to you.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.059
Done listening to reason?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.895
Claudia is probably crossing state lines
as we speak

19:06.979 --> 19:08.605
thanks to your publicity stunt.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.525
Or she'll be caught sooner because
the whole country is looking for her.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.902
Did you think to run your plan
past the FBI?

19:13.986 --> 19:16.864
Your 15 minutes of infamy
could've jeopardized their investigation.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.658
Fallon, when Adam was kidnapped,
I stayed quiet

19:19.741 --> 19:22.578
because that's what they told me to do,
and it cost us.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.623
-I wasn't gonna make that mistake again.
-You are not negotiating with kidnappers.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.210
This is benzoholic Claudia. She has
no intention of handing her baby back.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.714
If she makes it out of Atlanta,
that kid's blood is on your hands.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.009
My hands?
How dare you point your finger at me

19:37.092 --> 19:38.760
when you started this whole mess?

19:38.844 --> 19:41.305
-If you hadn't gone to visit Claudia

19:41.388 --> 19:42.431
and riled her up.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.558
Whatever you said to her,
she broke out the next day.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.227
And then she came here,
and then she killed Cristal.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.856
You think I have blood on my hands?
You have Cristal's blood on yours.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.786
Kirby. What are you

20:05.287 --> 20:06.371
I'm sorry.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.582
I didn't have anyone else to talk to. Most of the people I know
are in Australia,

20:11.543 --> 20:15.881
and the ones here, I've already slept with
and are no longer interested in me.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.800
-Kirby, I'm in the middle of--
-Here's the sitch.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.930
You took a semester of family psych,
and I have some...

20:23.889 --> 20:26.058
daddy issues I need to work on.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.645
Which is also what the people
I've slept with would say. Huh.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.771
Well, the truth is,

20:31.271 --> 20:34.358
my dad keeps treating me
like I'm an immature, bratty child.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.110
And... why do you think that is?

20:37.819 --> 20:39.029
I have no idea.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.741
But I'm tired of trying to prove him wrong
when I shouldn't.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.078
I should just embrace it. Screw it, right?

20:46.161 --> 20:48.705
If he doesn't think I'm an adult,
why act like one?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.554
Hey.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.016
-I...

21:09.351 --> 21:12.396
came to get a bottle of wine
for the new boss.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.773
I couldn't think of what else
to get him for Christmas.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.317
Thought I'd slip in and out
of the servants' entrance.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.278
And miss out on being questioned
by the feds?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.488
Any news on LB?
-Not yet.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.742
The only news is that Daddy accused me
of Cristal's murder.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.744
-Well, he's not totally wrong.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.163
I opened Pandora's box
when I went to see Claudia,

21:30.247 --> 21:31.331
and then she killed Cristal.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.667
-That's a bit of a reach.
-No, but it's true.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.045
Now she has LB. If anything happens,
I'll never forgive myself.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.422
Are you done spinning?

21:38.505 --> 21:40.048
No, not even close.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.844
I mean, what if I'm a horrible person,
Michael?

21:43.927 --> 21:47.597
What if my constant need to prove myself
and to take over my dad's company

21:47.681 --> 21:49.641
is what got us into this mess?

21:49.725 --> 21:52.936
Listen. This is your father
we're talking about here.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.980
He's in a dark place.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.148
He's desperate.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.777
People say and do terrible things
when they're desperate.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.072
You are not a horrible person.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.159
I grew up in a family

22:07.242 --> 22:10.996
where if you don't stab someone in the
back before dinner, you don't get dessert.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.958
I forget sometimes that
there are decent people in this world.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.502
Thank you for being one of them.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.306
Don't worry. It's a short walk, Matthew.
Mommy needs to pick up her happy pills.

22:29.389 --> 22:34.352
<i>Which is why I'm offering $100,000 reward</i>
<i>for any information leading to her arrest.</i>

22:34.436 --> 22:35.687
<i>-If you have seen...</i>

22:36.146 --> 22:40.317
I'm calling from the Hotel Clermont.
That lady you're looking for is here.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.879
-You must be Ada's new guy.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.007
Welcome to the fold.
I assume you got the full shipment?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.426
It's all there.
I assume you've got the cash?

23:09.096 --> 23:11.556
And what does she have for us?

23:12.182 --> 23:14.267
The <i>Mona Lisa,</i> perhaps.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.731
Feels like you can get this stuff
at Bed, Bath and Beyond,

23:19.815 --> 23:21.525
but... what do I know?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.402
Where you shipping all this?

23:24.486 --> 23:29.407
That's usually on a need-to-know basis.
And trust me, you don't need to know.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.077
I'll get your payment.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.458
Wait a minute.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.962
You work for VKI?

23:42.045 --> 23:45.006
Serving all your shipping needs
since 1908.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.884
At least that's how the jingle
in the commercial goes.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.221
Hold on.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.225
What is he up to?

24:02.649 --> 24:03.650
What the hell?

24:03.733 --> 24:06.653
I don't carry black-market antique
insurance, buddy.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.113
You're gonna have to pay--

24:10.615 --> 24:11.658
What is this?

24:12.367 --> 24:16.037
Either antique heroin... or just heroin.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.831
Trying to slip drugs in with the shipment?

24:18.665 --> 24:21.501
What? No. Not me.
I had no idea what Ada was shipping.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.254
-I just saw the VKI logo--
-That's a load of crap.

24:24.337 --> 24:27.966
You knew all about this.
This is next-level illegal.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.927
No way. Deal is off. Unload everything.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.597
This is not what we signed up for.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.183
-I didn't know about any of this.
-Save it.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.436
We got a problem here.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.532
I'm Blake Carrington.
Did you call my hotline?

24:52.616 --> 24:55.327
-You'll get your money if it's her.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.453
It's her, all right.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.705
Are you gonna write me a check?
I prefer cash.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.873
Oh, my God.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.917
-We have a visual on her.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.419
She's not in a room. She's on the roof.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.088
Elevator's broken.
-Of course it is.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.933
Claudia! No!
What are you doing

25:18.016 --> 25:21.937
Why can't you people just leave me alone?
You just wanna take him away from me.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.398
Like you did my husband.
But you can't. He's my baby.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.817
Claudia, please give me LB. Please.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.069
His name is Matthew.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.447
Claudia... we wanna help you and Matthew.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.741
No, you don't. You just wanna shoot me.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.160
Just take a step back, okay?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.501
Don't you come any closer.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.546
Hey, Dad, why don't you tell
Santa's little helpers to stand down?

25:48.630 --> 25:51.883
-She's right. They're scaring her.
Okay. Back up. Back up.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.471
Claudia, I want you to listen to me.
We can talk this through.

25:56.554 --> 25:57.973
You should've tried talking to me

25:58.056 --> 26:01.142
before you locked me in a padded cell
for six months.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.395
It does crazy things to a person.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.148
It is a miracle I even had this baby
and that it was okay

26:07.232 --> 26:09.693
after the hell
you and your wife put me through.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.654
May she rest in peace.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.199
It was you, wasn't it?

26:17.575 --> 26:18.660
You killed my aunt.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.248
And I would do it again
if it would bring Matthew back.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.332
But it won't.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.048
Claudia.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.343
We both lost someone.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.013
I know how that feels.

26:39.472 --> 26:44.477
You're scared. And you're alone.
And you don't know what the future holds.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.397
-You don't even know if there is a future.
-But there is.

26:48.523 --> 26:49.649
Who the hell are you?

26:50.108 --> 26:53.278
And, sure,
there's a future for Blake Carrington.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.905
He can buy any future he wants.
But what about me?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.534
-But that's just it, Claudia.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.037
He is your future.

27:02.871 --> 27:06.333
He is the last part of Matthew
that lives on, the only part.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.754
He would want what's best for him.
I know you want that, too, don't you?

27:18.803 --> 27:20.680
-I just love him so much.
Of course.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.434
And the best thing for him right now
is for you to come with us.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.935
Okay? So, just come here.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.439
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Give me the baby.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.359
No! No, no. You're lying to me.

27:32.442 --> 27:35.904
-No, you're all lying!
-No, no, no!

27:35.987 --> 27:37.447
-No!
No!

27:40.784 --> 27:43.078
No. No.

27:45.663 --> 27:46.498
No.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.920
Are you sure?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.214
Mr. Carrington, it wasn't a baby.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.800
It wasn't a real baby.
She was carrying a doll.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.184
Sam, Sam, Sam.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.937
Sam, hey, hey. It wasn't a real baby.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.814
It was a doll.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.109
No.
-It was a doll. Yeah.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.613
Thank God.

28:20.156 --> 28:23.493
Wait. If Claudia doesn't have
the baby, then...

28:23.910 --> 28:25.203
Then who the hell does?

28:25.662 --> 28:29.207
<i>♪ The outside, the outside ♪</i>

28:30.125 --> 28:32.794
When I was 10, I told my dad
I had to stay home from school

28:32.877 --> 28:35.713
because I had chicken pox,
and he swore I drew them on.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.341
I mean... I did.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.009
But he didn't know that.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.096
-No.

28:43.930 --> 28:47.809
I have a job interview, which I need
since you guys, you know, fired me.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.062
This has been like therapy for me.
How about I write you a check?

28:52.355 --> 28:55.066
Unless you accept other forms of payment.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.154
-Kirby, I--
-You're no fun.

29:01.656 --> 29:05.118
Can I get, like, a soda or something
before I leave?

29:05.577 --> 29:06.411
Of course.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.277
Don't worry, little guy.
Auntie Kirby is gonna take you home.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.781
-Shh.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.532
You woke the baby.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.248
-The pacifier was missing,

29:52.332 --> 29:54.375
but only after you came
to talk to the police.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.754
You knew how much LB loved it.
That's what made you a good nanny,

29:57.837 --> 30:00.632
in a <i>Hand That Rocks the Cradle</i>
kind of way.

30:00.715 --> 30:03.301
-You're smarter than you look.
-Wish I could say the same.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.304
Why would you do this?

30:07.180 --> 30:08.765
Just because Sam fired you?

30:08.848 --> 30:10.934
No, it's because of why he fired me.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.936
He wasn't sure
if he could keep it in his pants.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.272
He put his needs ahead of the baby's,
something I would never do.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.944
Don't you see? LB is better off with me.
Sam was gonna ruin that poor kid's life.

30:21.027 --> 30:25.406
Of course. Because you seem
like a truly responsible kidnapper.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.660
Shut up. You have no idea
what negligence can do to a child.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.705
Look, rather than kill me in front
of the baby and traumatize him for life,

30:32.997 --> 30:35.959
why don't you just give me the knife
and I'll take him home?

30:36.751 --> 30:39.671
I promise I won't tell anyone
what you did.

30:39.754 --> 30:43.216
Open the door!

30:58.439 --> 30:59.816
Took you long enough.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.320
Ada, where are you?
What is going on

31:04.404 --> 31:06.322
VKI

31:06.948 --> 31:08.074
Let me guess.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.452
-She's not taking your calls.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.829
Triangulated your phone.

31:13.329 --> 31:16.374
I'm glad to see you moving up the ladder,
Mike Jones.

31:17.166 --> 31:21.546
You set off the smoke bomb at the club.
You're the reason my sister got trampled.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.840
-You don't need to be here.
-Neither do you.

31:24.215 --> 31:27.010
You're still working for her?
Even after you got the blackmail back?

31:27.093 --> 31:28.803
Nobody.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.681
-I can explain.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.518
Son of a bitch.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.439
-This guy called the feds.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.441
-It was all a setup.
-Look out, Jeff!

31:42.650 --> 31:43.484
Get out of here!

31:50.199 --> 31:51.117
I got you.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.744
Go, go, go.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.710
FBI! Stop right there!
Hands in the air!

32:04.505 --> 32:05.715
Don't move!

32:06.341 --> 32:10.303
The FBI, a trained security team
and our entire family,

32:10.386 --> 32:12.221
all after this baby...

32:13.139 --> 32:15.308
and yet it was Kirby who figured it out.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.186
-This is a low point for me.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.773
Mr. Carrington is on the phone to the FBI.
Authorities will be here shortly.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.692
That psycho is in the study
being watched by Security.

32:24.776 --> 32:28.321
Well, I guess this is a big win
for Team Downstairs, huh?

32:28.404 --> 32:31.950
As much as it pains me to say this...
thank you.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.118
Kind words from Fallon Carrington.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.372
-Calm down.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.040
I'll go get his teddy.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.337
Kirby.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.132
Thank goodness you texted me when you did.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.593
-I'm fine, Dad.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.472
-In fact, I've been fine for a while now.
-Yes, I can see that.

32:54.555 --> 32:57.350
I missed the part of your growing up
when you became an adult.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.353
I'm still not used to it.
That's my fault, not yours.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.480
I promise you I will get there.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.524
Thank you. It means a lot.

33:04.607 --> 33:07.735
If I don't, I'm sure you'll find a way
to knock me out cold.

33:13.950 --> 33:17.578
Could I have a moment alone
with Lizzie Borden?

33:21.874 --> 33:24.127
That was quite a stunt
you pulled off today.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.004
You're all liars.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.463
You took my baby from me.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.632
I'm sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.426
Alexis Carrington.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.847
Oh, I'd shake your hand, but... no.

33:36.472 --> 33:37.640
Alexis.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.226
You're Hank's mother.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.228
Or should I say "lover"?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.605
"Partner in crime"

33:45.023 --> 33:46.315
He told me everything.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.027
You're the biggest liar of them all.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.822
Who's Hank, dear?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.450
Another doll of yours?

33:55.533 --> 33:56.534
What?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.203
No, he's Hank.

33:59.620 --> 34:04.000
I do have a son,
but his name's Adam... not Hank.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.420
Clearly you must be confused.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.464
I hear that that happens to you a lot.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.967
That's not true. He--
He told me his name was Hank.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.721
Is he here with you now?

34:19.766 --> 34:22.852
Oh, I see, Claudia.
That's what the pills are for.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.687
You are taking your pills, right?

34:25.521 --> 34:26.731
Poor little thing.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.025
Once you get back on those meds,

34:29.484 --> 34:31.736
I'm sure that you'll see things
more clearly.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.698
Police have arrived, Mrs. Carrington.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.159
They're here to take Ms. Blaisdel
into custody.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.795
You know,
you really are a crazy lady still...

34:49.587 --> 34:53.341
in or out of that place
where they... locked you up.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.431
Wait. Where are you taking me?

35:01.349 --> 35:04.393
-You said you were gonna help me.
-And you said you killed my wife.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.895
Everyone up there heard it.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.898
Look, I am helping you.

35:08.981 --> 35:13.861
I'm helping you understand the pain
you caused me and my family...

35:15.404 --> 35:17.240
by taking away what you love.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.034
I know it's cruel. He's only a baby.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.744
Will it make things equal?

35:22.703 --> 35:23.830
I don't know.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.127
-But it's a hell of a start.
-No. You can't do this to me.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.170
You can't keep my baby.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.714
You're gonna pay for this, you hear me?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.216
I'll be back!

35:38.970 --> 35:39.971
Claudia's right.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.558
Words that have never been spoken before.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.767
We can't keep this baby.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.520
The thought of giving him up
is killing me,

35:47.603 --> 35:49.105
but he's not ours to keep.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.524
I don't think that they have day care
in jail.

35:51.607 --> 35:54.152
He was never Hank's baby.
He was Matthew's.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.320
-And Fallon found his parents.
-But, Sam--

35:56.404 --> 35:58.865
We've had our own share
of Christmas miracles.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.741
Now it's their chance

36:00.825 --> 36:03.619
to be with the one piece of Matthew
that still lives on.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.206
He needs to be with his real family.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.584
And that's not us.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.468
I need a hospital.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.346
We're almost there, man.
I'm going as fast as I can.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.267
You set me up.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.978
If it makes you feel better,
I also set up VKI.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.190
You see, you delivered heroin
to their head of shipping.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.901
<i>Once the FBI looks deeper</i>
<i>into Van Kirk Industries,</i>

36:34.984 --> 36:37.737
they'll find a string
of illegal shipments in progress,

36:37.820 --> 36:39.447
enough to take down the company.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.825
This was your plan all along.
I was just collateral damage?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.243
I was going to say "pawn,"

36:44.827 --> 36:47.330
but "collateral damage"
sounds more heroic.

36:47.413 --> 36:51.167
I can only imagine what our friend Nico
is telling the feds about your role.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.794
Nico can ID me. I could go to prison, Ada.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.131
"Could" is a very glass-half-full way
of looking at it.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.717
Oh, and I wouldn't stop anytime soon.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.511
The FBI may have gotten a tip
as to your getaway car.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.021
Why are we stopping?

37:12.813 --> 37:15.066
You are not gonna get away with this.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.567
But I already have.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.278
I'm a ghost, remember?

37:23.449 --> 37:24.367
Please.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.828
You gotta get me to the hospital.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.794
I'm gonna drop you off.
After that, we're both on our own.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.179
Jeff, you okay?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.765
I'm gonna get you to the hospital.
Just stay with me.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.554
"How is this handsome man
going to cope without me?"

38:27.972 --> 38:30.308
Well... I won't.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.022
But you, you are going to be happier
with your grandparents

38:36.105 --> 38:37.732
than you'd ever be here with us.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.360
Mm-hm. Now, don't get me wrong.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.071
The food, the shoes...

38:45.156 --> 38:46.741
the turndown service...

38:47.325 --> 38:48.534
all amazing.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.539
But this family wouldn't be able
to move past who your parents were.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.251
That's not fair to you.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.046
So, I'm giving you a clean slate.

39:01.756 --> 39:02.631
That's...

39:03.382 --> 39:05.343
That's the fatherly thing to do.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.306
Even though
I won't get to be a father anymore.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.102
Amazing.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.645
Thank you.

39:17.271 --> 39:19.648
I loved that dress
the first time I saw it.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.152
I'm just amazed
that it lasted for five seasons.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.528
I'm talking about you.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.781
I don't know how you did it,

39:26.864 --> 39:29.867
but Claudia didn't seem to have much
to say about Hank.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.120
It seems like you managed
to get out of another lie.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.790
I certainly have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:35.873 --> 39:39.001
I think you might be going a little heavy
on the eggnog.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.669
But... merry Christmas.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.048
<i>♪ Let me love you ♪</i>

39:44.965 --> 39:48.511
<i>♪ Let me love you ♪</i>

39:49.512 --> 39:51.889
Is this your way of, uh...

39:52.973 --> 39:54.183
apologizing?

39:54.266 --> 39:56.102
Don't know. Never had to.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.312
Fine.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.941
I am sorry. You were right.

40:02.024 --> 40:04.318
The reason we found Claudia
is because of you.

40:04.402 --> 40:08.322
Your charm and wit on TV
won over America's hearts.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.241
You should host a daytime talk show.

40:13.911 --> 40:14.787
Thank you.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.376
But I wasn't right about everything.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.503
You're not responsible
for Cristal's death.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.172
It was a low blow.
I never should have said that.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.342
I was angry, you know,
about a lot of things.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.719
Are you still mad that I sold CA?

40:30.803 --> 40:33.639
If tonight has taught me anything,
it's that I am not always right.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.724
Maybe selling the company was a mistake. Actually, that you were right about.

40:37.893 --> 40:41.355
Wow. A Christmas gift
I didn't even need to unwrap.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.191
I always said the family
and the company were the same thing.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.945
Well, it took me losing the company
to realize that was never the case.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.865
Losing CA was the best thing
that ever happened to this family.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.117
It allowed me
to get my priorities straight.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.286
-Thank you.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.621
Well, I wouldn't know. I never had to.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.168
Steven asked me to keep the family
together while he was gone.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.544
I think I've done a good job.

41:03.627 --> 41:07.506
It only took a baby being kidnapped
by a crazy lady for you to do so.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.634
You know what they say. You wanna
make a purse, you gotta kill some pythons.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.013
Now that Steven's coming back,
you can hand over those reins to him.

41:14.096 --> 41:17.016
-And Culhane, too.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.726
He told me he would be back for dinner.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.936
I'm sure he's just out
doing some shopping.

41:21.645 --> 41:22.563
Yeah.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.065
Is everything all right?

41:25.149 --> 41:27.318
I just had
this very disturbing conversation

41:27.401 --> 41:30.321
with the head of Steven's foundation
in Paraguay.

41:30.404 --> 41:33.073
Steven didn't get onto the flight
back to Atlanta.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.327
He's missing.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.418
Maybe this is him calling.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.213
Steven?

41:48.881 --> 41:52.551
Blake.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.137
I'm gonna need your help.
