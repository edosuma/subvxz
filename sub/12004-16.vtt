WEBVTT

00:00.093 --> 00:01.501
Previously on "Switched at birth..."

00:01.546 --> 00:05.512
I remember thinking,
"Wow, this guy is magic."

00:05.606 --> 00:06.872
"He can stop time."

00:09.462 --> 00:10.822
Here's to ripping everything out

00:11.017 --> 00:12.240
and starting all over again.

00:12.835 --> 00:14.754
- You're sleeping with him, aren't you?
- Yes.

00:14.992 --> 00:16.428
What's going to happen
when the girls find out?

00:16.428 --> 00:17.923
I don't understand how you can

00:17.982 --> 00:20.004
fall back in love with someone like that.

00:20.293 --> 00:21.915
There's a warrant for Angelo in Italy.

00:21.941 --> 00:23.096
- He's a fugitive.
- What?

00:23.156 --> 00:24.727
You turned Angelo in!

00:24.727 --> 00:25.600
You what?

00:25.600 --> 00:26.326
I didn't turn anybody in.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.539
Your parents didn't turn Angelo in.
I did.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.833
No no, Sorrento, with two "r"s,

00:32.833 --> 00:34.071
first name Angelo.

00:35.586 --> 00:38.188
Could he be at a different
detention facility?

00:38.774 --> 00:41.209
So he might not be in custody at all?

00:42.248 --> 00:44.104
Okay, is there anybody there who

00:44.104 --> 00:45.863
can give me a straight answer.

00:45.965 --> 00:47.737
No no, don't put me on hold again...

00:53.848 --> 00:55.943
Immigration has no record of him,

00:55.943 --> 00:59.112
they are so disorganized.
I mean he could be deported already

00:59.112 --> 01:00.314
and they wouldn't know.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.046
Do you want some soup?
You haven't eaten anything.

01:05.046 --> 01:06.373
No no, I'm fine.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.084
Maybe they didn't find him.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.941
What do you mean?

01:12.444 --> 01:14.679
You told them where he lived.

01:14.713 --> 01:16.913
And I told him I called immigration.

01:16.913 --> 01:18.953
So maybe he left before they got there.

01:19.097 --> 01:22.657
You told him? you couldn't
help it, could you?

01:22.657 --> 01:23.813
You just had to let him know that you

01:23.813 --> 01:25.226
were the one that blew the whistle.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.149
And I don't regret it.

01:27.149 --> 01:28.743
You were already sleeping with him.

01:28.743 --> 01:30.542
Next you would start drinking again

01:30.542 --> 01:34.107
and then you two would start
fighting and throwing things.

01:34.107 --> 01:35.569
What, you have a crystal ball now?

01:35.569 --> 01:37.642
I'm a grown woman!
I can make my own decisions.

01:37.642 --> 01:39.357
But your decisions affect Daphne and Bay.

01:39.357 --> 01:42.476
Don't involve the girls to justify
meddling in my business!

01:42.476 --> 01:44.383
Stop it, please!

01:44.428 --> 01:47.758
Angelo is gone and
he is still causing problems.

01:48.486 --> 01:50.976
Angelo is gone and
you both don't even care!

01:50.976 --> 01:53.567
- Bay, we didn't make him leave.
- If immigration

01:53.567 --> 01:55.195
picked him up, there's nothing we can do.

01:55.195 --> 01:56.670
You can call an immigration lawyer.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.913
And didn't you both say that you

01:58.913 --> 02:00.747
wanted to help him work all this out?

02:00.747 --> 02:02.953
If he gets ahold of us, we will do that.

02:02.953 --> 02:04.628
So you're just gonna stand
there and do nothing?

02:04.628 --> 02:07.177
We can't put our lives on hold.
For one thing,

02:07.177 --> 02:09.735
- your grandmother is coming tomorrow.
- So what?

02:09.735 --> 02:11.454
- Bay!
- Honey, you love her.

02:11.454 --> 02:12.977
You always have such
a great time with her.

02:12.977 --> 02:15.008
Okay could you just both do me a favor and try

02:15.008 --> 02:16.850
not to look so happy that he's gone.

02:21.347 --> 02:24.552
You know, I'm wondering
if Angelo got himself deported

02:24.552 --> 02:26.420
because your mom's coming to town.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.447
That's not funny. She's not that bad.

02:28.447 --> 02:30.863
Honey, that's the third time
you've cleaned the fridge this week.

02:30.863 --> 02:32.056
Don't throw those away.

02:32.677 --> 02:35.285
You know how critical
she is about my housekeeping.

02:35.430 --> 02:37.288
Try having her as a business partner.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.337
- Silent partner.
- Babe, she is never silent.

02:40.337 --> 02:41.228
How long are we going to put up with

02:41.228 --> 02:42.885
this whole partnership charade.

02:42.885 --> 02:44.625
I don't need her investment in my business.

02:44.625 --> 02:45.624
♪♪

02:45.624 --> 02:47.911
It was to make her feel useful,
part of the family.

02:47.911 --> 02:50.750
I wonder what her next grand
business idea is gonna be.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.590
You like her grand ideas.

02:52.971 --> 02:55.787
"Buy 10 car washes,
get 10 gallons of gas free."

02:55.855 --> 02:57.180
That was hers, right?

02:57.285 --> 02:58.391
One grand idea.

02:58.505 --> 03:00.708
I'll keep her on a short leash.

03:00.892 --> 03:02.444
You said that about Angelo.

03:02.621 --> 03:04.611
It's only for a few days

03:05.175 --> 03:06.957
and then she's back to Scottsdale.

03:07.139 --> 03:08.819
We can handle her for a few days, right?

03:09.989 --> 03:10.865
Hm-mmm.

03:22.508 --> 03:25.446
Hey! uh, so...

03:26.526 --> 03:30.593
Do you know if Regina has
heard anything from Angelo?

03:31.342 --> 03:32.550
No, nothing.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.842
Do you think he'll come back?

03:36.137 --> 03:37.181
I don't know.

03:37.823 --> 03:40.654
Maybe he'll call and let
us know where he is.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.157
Don't wait for that to happen.

03:44.355 --> 03:47.804
You'll be disappointed everytime
the phone rings and it's not him.

03:50.408 --> 03:51.282
I know.

03:56.197 --> 03:59.428
- I'd better go move my car.
- Bay.

04:03.282 --> 04:07.553
For what it's worth,
I wasn't happy to see Angelo go either.

04:08.394 --> 04:09.207
Really?

04:12.388 --> 04:13.899
Hey, Bay, your thing is blocking me in.

04:13.899 --> 04:15.337
I gotta pick up grandma at the airport.

04:15.363 --> 04:18.303
Uh, okay, just hold on,
I'm gonna go get my keys.

04:20.869 --> 04:24.095
Did mom warn you about grandma?

04:24.299 --> 04:26.964
- Warn me?
- Sometimes she says things out loud

04:26.964 --> 04:29.565
- that she probably shouldn't.
- Like Bay?

04:29.616 --> 04:30.687
Times 50.

04:31.510 --> 04:33.997
She may say something
stupid about you being deaf.

04:34.932 --> 04:36.836
It's okay. I've been there.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.162
On the plus side,
she brings good presents.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.637
Honey, Elaine Dunbar just told me

04:54.637 --> 04:58.202
that the Buckner board picked you
to paint a panel on the wall of honor.

04:58.624 --> 05:01.241
- Did you know that?
- Yeah, it's customary

05:01.241 --> 05:03.266
to inform the artist that's been chosen.

05:03.453 --> 05:05.943
Well, honey, congratulations!
I am so proud of you.

05:05.943 --> 05:09.098
- Thanks.
- Why didn't you say anything?

05:09.098 --> 05:12.338
I was going to at the dinner with Angelo,

05:12.338 --> 05:14.846
but then my parents'
lawyer dug up dirt on him

05:14.846 --> 05:17.963
- and scared him away.
- That's not fair, Bay.

05:19.676 --> 05:20.595
Grandma's here.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.025
- Whoa!
- Hey, partner.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.843
- How's business?
- ** great as always.

05:33.087 --> 05:34.092
- Yeah.
- Grandma!

05:35.824 --> 05:37.938
Cookie! Aw, honey!

05:37.938 --> 05:39.808
Or should I say empanada?

05:39.808 --> 05:42.071
- You can.
- Mom!

05:42.071 --> 05:44.766
Hi darling.
** different with your hair.

05:44.766 --> 05:46.483
- It's nice.
- No, it's... it's...

05:49.251 --> 05:51.341
Mom, this is Daphne.

05:53.258 --> 05:54.948
It's nice to meet you.

05:58.879 --> 06:01.746
It's like looking at
your mother at your age.

06:02.146 --> 06:04.785
I mean like the freckles! They're exact.

06:04.785 --> 06:08.039
- It's incredible.
- She thinks that we look alike.

06:12.211 --> 06:13.420
You know, you have the same

06:13.420 --> 06:15.327
hearing aid my friend Lucy has.

06:15.705 --> 06:17.471
It's hard to change the battery, isn't it?

06:17.728 --> 06:19.816
- I've had lots of practice.
- Oh.

06:22.295 --> 06:24.410
We've got so much catching up to do.

06:25.290 --> 06:27.741
Everybody, come sit down. Come sit down!

06:32.397 --> 06:35.190
Okay, let's see what we have here.

06:35.190 --> 06:38.525
Um, well, this goes to Toby.

06:38.525 --> 06:40.988
- Ah! thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:42.341 --> 06:46.463
- And this one for Bay.
- Thank you, grandma.

06:47.213 --> 06:49.340
And this

06:49.848 --> 06:51.292
goes to...

06:51.612 --> 06:53.132
For Daphne.

06:55.694 --> 06:56.539
Thank you.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.725
What is it?

07:08.463 --> 07:10.079
A poker set?

07:10.079 --> 07:12.212
Whoa! with gold chips.

07:13.904 --> 07:16.006
No way! Ohhh.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.199
Grandma, this is perfect!
How did you know?

07:20.199 --> 07:21.380
Bonnie, that's very generous,

07:21.380 --> 07:23.065
but Toby's not allowed to gamble.

07:23.065 --> 07:25.187
- Aw, since when?
- Uh...

07:25.706 --> 07:27.696
Well... That's okay. I'll just teach
you how to play bridge.

07:27.696 --> 07:29.745
- Thank you, grandma.
- Uh, grandma,

07:29.745 --> 07:31.886
they picked me to paint a mural...

07:31.886 --> 07:34.247
Don't be shy. Go ahead
and open it, Daphne.

07:38.819 --> 07:40.934
Oh, it's so pretty.

07:42.434 --> 07:44.439
Now that was my grandmother's

07:45.137 --> 07:47.086
and because you're the newest member

07:47.086 --> 07:49.421
of the family, I want you to have it.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.215
Thank you.

07:52.566 --> 07:54.113
Call me grandma Bonnie.

07:54.479 --> 07:56.383
Grandma Bonnie.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.144
Grandma, they asked me to paint
part of a mural for school.

08:00.144 --> 08:01.952
You know, that's abalone and

08:01.952 --> 08:03.984
then the pink part is a sandstone.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.091
That's wonderful, sweetie.

08:06.091 --> 08:07.929
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

08:07.929 --> 08:09.920
I was thinking of doing
something with the...

08:10.429 --> 08:12.916
like the mexican muralists
did in the '40s.

08:12.916 --> 08:15.175
Yeah, like a Buckner
bulldog with a sombrero?

08:15.175 --> 08:18.007
I think cameos are making a comeback.

08:18.171 --> 08:21.866
- It's beautiful.
- Honey, I don't think she heard you.

08:22.588 --> 08:25.950
I hope you wear it when we go
to tea at the Ainsley house.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.446
Oh, we always go to tea

08:28.446 --> 08:30.537
every time grandma comes to visit.

08:30.537 --> 08:31.476
Sounds fun.

08:31.832 --> 08:34.855
Yeah, tea and scones... it's a real gas.

08:44.402 --> 08:47.494
- See you later.
- Just the man I wanted to see.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.519
Hey! so did you get a chance
to listen to those tracks?

08:50.519 --> 08:52.050
That's what I wanted to see you about...

08:52.050 --> 08:53.630
these sound like your old songs.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.426
No, that's new stuff.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.819
They could be Guitar Face B-sides.

08:57.819 --> 09:00.230
I thought you were
experimenting with a new sound.

09:01.246 --> 09:03.149
Uhh, it's acoustic.

09:03.566 --> 09:06.939
So you plug in, add Wilke's bass

09:06.939 --> 09:08.436
and voilÃ  Guitar face.

09:09.121 --> 09:11.105
Okay, uh...

09:11.419 --> 09:12.428
Any good news?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.320
Look, you wanted me to help you

09:14.320 --> 09:16.044
and I'm taking this seriously.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.227
You're talented and you
have better songs in you.

09:18.227 --> 09:20.371
You just gotta break some old habits.

09:21.434 --> 09:22.941
Change is a good thing.

09:23.251 --> 09:24.850
I've got practice. I'll call you later.

09:36.792 --> 09:37.788
Daphne?

09:39.359 --> 09:42.076
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- Hi, Monica.

09:42.884 --> 09:44.693
Don't you go to that deaf school?

09:44.890 --> 09:46.968
I do, but I play basketball here.

09:48.398 --> 09:50.345
- It's a long story.
- Oh, I know,

09:50.345 --> 09:54.284
I saw it in the paper.
From East Riverside to Mission Hills.

09:54.284 --> 09:55.932
It's like a real-life telenovela.

09:56.101 --> 09:57.762
"La paloma del barrio."

09:59.601 --> 10:01.630
- Do you go to school here?
- No.

10:01.916 --> 10:04.620
They let us barrio girls
use the track here.

10:05.053 --> 10:08.261
White guilt. But it's way
better than our busted track.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.222
Do you still play midnight
madness basketball?

10:11.401 --> 10:14.016
Yeah, but it's a bunch of scrubs.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.176
- You and me could take 'em all.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.277 --> 10:22.143
Hey, Daphne, do you remember

10:22.143 --> 10:24.584
if I had my watch with
me in cooking class?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.400
Um, I don't know.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.316
Because I could have sworn I had it

10:28.316 --> 10:30.736
in my locker and it's not there now.

10:30.989 --> 10:32.691
Why did you look at me when you said that?

10:33.145 --> 10:34.510
I didn't look at you.

10:34.887 --> 10:35.716
Should I?

10:36.661 --> 10:38.786
This is Monica. I know her from...

10:38.887 --> 10:40.727
They told us we could change in here.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.699
- Who did?
- Your coach.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.304
I didn't steal your watch.

10:45.673 --> 10:47.852
It's just funny because

10:47.852 --> 10:50.709
nothing has ever been missing
from my locker before,

10:50.818 --> 10:54.795
and then today you and
your girls show up and...

10:54.795 --> 10:55.475
And what?

10:57.264 --> 10:58.043
Forget it.

10:58.904 --> 11:01.186
- And what? finish it!
- Hey, don't touch me!

11:03.650 --> 11:06.053
Hey, stop it. Cut it out!

11:07.557 --> 11:08.929
What the hell's going on?

11:13.402 --> 11:15.859
I never said that she stole my watch.

11:15.859 --> 11:18.881
I just said that nothing had
gone missing before today.

11:19.927 --> 11:21.518
Kennish, how did you get involved?

11:22.486 --> 11:23.846
It's Vasquez.

11:23.956 --> 11:26.398
And I didn't. I was trying to stop it.

11:26.704 --> 11:28.347
That's not what it looked like to me.

11:28.347 --> 11:30.259
- That girl hit me first!
- Enough.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.314
I should suspend both of you,

11:32.314 --> 11:34.166
but I think the lesson **.

11:34.268 --> 11:35.871
- What lesson?
- That just because

11:35.871 --> 11:37.142
they're from East Riverside

11:37.142 --> 11:39.248
- it doesn't make them thieves.
- I didn't...

11:39.248 --> 11:41.510
You have one week to complete four hours

11:41.510 --> 11:44.012
of community service in East Riverside.

11:44.012 --> 11:45.358
Mrs. Graham's class will be doing

11:45.358 --> 11:46.299
a project there this week and

11:46.299 --> 11:47.726
I told her you'd be joining them.

11:47.726 --> 11:48.191
Uh...

11:48.191 --> 11:49.544
Maybe spending some time in that

11:49.544 --> 11:51.484
neighborhood will teach you

11:51.686 --> 11:54.054
to respect the people
that come from there.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.150
- Oh, hi.
- Is Regina in?

12:05.150 --> 12:07.991
- Yes, come on in.
- Sorry to intrude.

12:07.991 --> 12:10.916
But my mom wanted to meet all of you.

12:12.387 --> 12:15.238
So, mom, this is Regina, Daphne's mother.

12:15.779 --> 12:18.696
- Oh, I'm Bonnie.
- Nice to meet you.

12:18.802 --> 12:21.435
Very nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

12:21.435 --> 12:23.703
- Oh, oh...
- Uh, mom,

12:23.730 --> 12:26.414
This is Adrianna Vasquez.
She's Regina's mother.

12:26.414 --> 12:28.337
Uh, con mucho gusto.

12:28.695 --> 12:30.034
It's the only spanish I know.

12:30.554 --> 12:33.045
That's all right. I speak english.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.266
Of course, yes.

12:36.295 --> 12:38.077
I love what you've done with the place.

12:38.909 --> 12:40.340
What happened to all the squirrels?

12:40.340 --> 12:43.242
A few of them... ran off.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.142
But I painted a little and
put up some of my stuff.

12:47.621 --> 12:50.222
Oh, mom, Regina painted that.

12:50.222 --> 12:52.150
She's very artistic. I think that's

12:52.150 --> 12:53.846
where Bay gets her talent from.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.206
What do you think Bay might
have gotten from her father?

13:03.133 --> 13:06.092
Aha! that is grandma's way of being nosy

13:06.092 --> 13:08.876
- without trying to be nosy.
- I just want

13:08.876 --> 13:09.979
to know where you came from darling.

13:09.979 --> 13:13.762
- You can't blame me.
- Mom, look. This is Daphne

13:13.762 --> 13:15.919
- when she's little, look.
- She's five there.

13:16.046 --> 13:19.050
Oh my... that face,

13:19.838 --> 13:22.650
do you think maybe I could get
a photo for my album at home?

13:22.650 --> 13:25.178
Maybe from her baptism or first communion.

13:25.268 --> 13:27.216
I'm assuming that you're catholic.

13:27.427 --> 13:28.401
I am.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.192
Regina's "recovering."

13:32.499 --> 13:35.309
- I don't go to church anymore.
- Oh.

13:36.266 --> 13:38.150
I only go to church under protest

13:38.150 --> 13:39.952
so I'm pretty godless too grandma.

14:02.826 --> 14:05.223
Hey, can you put on headphones

14:05.223 --> 14:06.261
if you're going to string** your guitar

14:06.261 --> 14:08.337
I'm trying to create
important art over here.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.019
So important that it stays
in your garage all day?

14:11.260 --> 14:13.383
For your information, I'm doing the panel

14:13.383 --> 14:14.525
for the Buckner wall of honor.

14:14.525 --> 14:15.822
it's my first punt out of commission.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.606
Oh yeah, the bulldog with the sombrero.

14:18.759 --> 14:20.869
It wasn't funny the first
time you said it either.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.991
- Dad laughed.
- Exactly.

14:28.006 --> 14:30.372
That stuff kinda sounded like Radiohead.

14:30.372 --> 14:33.605
I thought Guitar Face was, like,
a poor man's kings of leon?

14:33.822 --> 14:36.161
I'm experimenting,
thinking about going solo.

14:36.344 --> 14:38.542
Simone is actually trying
to get me some gigs.

14:38.995 --> 14:39.957
Simone?

14:41.131 --> 14:44.590
I know you two aren't
friends since... whenever.

14:44.590 --> 14:45.928
- We don't need to go there.
- Good,

14:45.928 --> 14:47.713
'cause that' between you two.

14:48.237 --> 14:49.936
Was it Simone's idea to start

14:49.936 --> 14:51.376
experimenting with a different sound.

14:51.989 --> 14:54.235
It's what she does.
She tries to mold people

14:54.235 --> 14:56.495
into what she wants them to be.

14:58.053 --> 14:59.092
But whatever.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.941
Here. Headphones, please.

15:11.530 --> 15:16.039
So in Scottsdale all the car
washes use recycled water

15:16.039 --> 15:17.938
because, well, it's the desert.

15:18.022 --> 15:20.501
But in Kansas City
you have plenty of water

15:20.501 --> 15:24.912
so we don't recycle. But what if we did?

15:25.169 --> 15:28.206
- I don't know.
- We'd be a green business.

15:28.206 --> 15:30.145
- Oh.
- We'd keep the customers we have

15:30.266 --> 15:31.863
and then we'd pull in new customers

15:31.863 --> 15:33.788
who had an axe to grind with the environment

15:33.788 --> 15:35.538
or ** saving water.

15:35.538 --> 15:36.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:37.205 --> 15:40.856
So do you remember that friend
I made on the alaskan cruise?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.168
Oh yeah, I heard about him.

15:42.168 --> 15:45.018
He was from Scottsdale and

15:45.018 --> 15:47.746
before he retired,
he was an advertising guru.

15:47.878 --> 15:50.846
So I had him do some mock-ups
for a billboard campaign.

15:51.479 --> 15:52.860
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.780
- Yeah.
- Nice, huh?

16:08.118 --> 16:10.218
I think this is overdoing it.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.915
The trash pick-up was probably enough.

16:14.157 --> 16:15.413
Two more hours.

16:15.992 --> 16:17.599
Hey, how did you know about that

16:17.599 --> 16:19.233
shortcut ** street.

16:19.408 --> 16:22.743
I used to live a few blocks over.
I know all the shortcuts.

16:22.743 --> 16:25.877
- You lived in East Riverside?
- That's how I know Monica.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.386
I thought you knew.
It was in the newspaper...

16:28.386 --> 16:30.142
- Me, Bay, the switch.
- Yeah, but

16:30.142 --> 16:32.193
I thought it said
you were from **side.

16:33.846 --> 16:34.793
See you later.

16:37.476 --> 16:38.732
Seriously?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.562
Just stay quiet.

16:43.929 --> 16:44.861
Hey, Monica.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.081
What are you doing here?

16:47.073 --> 16:48.914
We got in trouble for the fight.

16:48.914 --> 16:51.217
They punished you by making you
"give back to the 'hood?"

16:51.795 --> 16:52.849
That's whack.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.191
You wanna go another round, flaca?

16:56.191 --> 16:59.598
I just want my watch back
if you haven't pawned it already.

16:59.732 --> 17:02.924
Simone, stop. Monica,
if you just let us finish

17:02.924 --> 17:03.767
we'll get out of here and you'll

17:03.767 --> 17:05.134
never have to see Simone again.

17:05.134 --> 17:08.281
Simone? even her name's fancy.

17:09.638 --> 17:10.950
And don't get like that just because you

17:10.950 --> 17:12.713
live in Mission Hills now, right?

17:12.762 --> 17:16.126
I'm the same Daphne I was before.
my name is still Vasquez.

17:16.138 --> 17:17.959
Till you change it to something white.

17:18.394 --> 17:21.113
You never looked like any
Vasquez I ever knew anyway.

17:24.894 --> 17:26.472
All class.

17:27.219 --> 17:29.069
Aren't you glad you live
in Mission Hills now?

17:34.071 --> 17:35.854
Now that I know she's a vegetarian

17:36.072 --> 17:38.442
I'm gonna have to find
some meatless stew recipes.

17:38.747 --> 17:41.507
I'm really glad
you're getting alone with Daphne.

17:42.077 --> 17:43.719
Why wouldn't I?

17:43.824 --> 17:46.199
Because she's deaf? Katy...

17:46.922 --> 17:48.448
I know, it's silly.

17:50.382 --> 17:54.887
I think it's really nice
that you gave her the cameo,

17:55.191 --> 17:58.179
but I always thought you
were saving that for Bay.

18:00.822 --> 18:04.470
Oh, well, to be honest, I... I was.

18:08.493 --> 18:10.270
You know how much I love cookie.

18:10.908 --> 18:13.126
But I was thinking that

18:13.796 --> 18:15.415
I should keep it in the family.

18:17.013 --> 18:20.133
Well, nobody loves Bay more than I do,

18:20.737 --> 18:23.135
but, you know, blood is blood.

18:23.638 --> 18:26.395
And Daphne is your daughter.

18:26.395 --> 18:28.011
I mean, look at those freckles.

18:28.953 --> 18:32.037
Bay is my daughter too, mom.

18:33.508 --> 18:35.245
I know, but...

18:35.507 --> 18:37.475
But what? what?

18:37.557 --> 18:41.304
I'm just saying... well,
in terms of school,

18:41.449 --> 18:43.407
how many tutors did you have to use

18:43.407 --> 18:45.034
just to get her **high.

18:45.034 --> 18:46.930
And even then she barely made it.

18:47.062 --> 18:49.276
So this is about a report card?

18:49.846 --> 18:51.643
A lot of people are bad at math,

18:51.643 --> 18:53.886
and Bay is a brilliant artist.

18:53.978 --> 18:55.185
You should see how fast

18:55.185 --> 18:56.846
she picked up sign language too, mom.

18:56.846 --> 18:58.723
Meanwhile Daphne...

18:58.765 --> 19:01.384
with a single parent and a handicap

19:01.384 --> 19:05.152
and growing up in a ghetto?
I mean she made straight "A"s.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.996
- That's your daughter.
- It's not a handicap, mom.

19:07.996 --> 19:10.136
- It... it...
- Look, do you remember

19:10.136 --> 19:11.595
the Lewises across the street

19:11.595 --> 19:13.434
and they adopted this korean baby who

19:13.434 --> 19:16.405
grew up to be a national mer**.

19:16.831 --> 19:18.113
The Lewises don't even know what

19:18.113 --> 19:20.246
a national mer** is.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.696
Biology tells us what we are.

19:22.839 --> 19:24.564
It's not that simple.

19:27.655 --> 19:30.471
I love Bay, I always will,

19:30.923 --> 19:33.539
but I can't help it.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.613
I can't pretend

19:35.613 --> 19:38.137
that I don't see her differently now.

19:48.664 --> 19:50.310
Almost done.

19:51.916 --> 19:55.452
Oh wow, that looks great as a necklace!

19:55.552 --> 19:57.459
Your grandma is going to be very happy.

19:57.922 --> 19:59.826
Will everyone be this dressed up?

19:59.826 --> 20:01.481
Oh well, not really.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.499
We'll be the only ones wearing hats.

20:03.797 --> 20:06.088
We started doing it when Bay was six

20:06.144 --> 20:07.757
and it just stuck.

20:10.247 --> 20:11.236
Here you go.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.224
Look at that.

20:14.342 --> 20:16.395
You were born to wear that hat!

20:16.772 --> 20:17.510
C'mere.

20:23.850 --> 20:27.045
- Kathryn, I...
- Don't worry. If you have any doubts,

20:27.045 --> 20:28.908
just watch us and do what do.

20:29.185 --> 20:31.424
Except for Bay. Don't watch...

20:33.840 --> 20:34.765
Where is Bay?

21:09.996 --> 21:13.079
Bay! Bay!

21:14.125 --> 21:15.994
Jeez, mom, you scared me.

21:15.995 --> 21:18.139
I've been calling you for an hour.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.955
Daphne and your grandma are waiting
for us at the Ainsley house.

21:20.956 --> 21:23.357
Just go without me, okay?
Grandma won't care.

21:23.358 --> 21:25.174
Oh no, you don't.
I have your clothes in the car.

21:25.175 --> 21:28.596
- You can change while I drive.
- My car's here. I can drive.

21:28.597 --> 21:30.770
We're late already.
We're gonna miss our reservation.

21:30.771 --> 21:33.834
Calm down. Mom, every time
grandma comes here you get crazy.

21:33.835 --> 21:36.362
That's because, believe it or not,
some of us still care

21:36.363 --> 21:38.429
about what our mothers think.

21:39.225 --> 21:42.023
Now wash that paint off and let's go.

21:50.711 --> 21:51.814
Yes, I know.

21:52.452 --> 21:53.699
I'm sorry too.

21:54.790 --> 21:55.829
Thank you.

21:56.737 --> 21:58.169
Was that immigration?

22:00.992 --> 22:04.069
Actually, it was the equipment
vendor for the salon.

22:04.204 --> 22:05.246
He's agreed to buy back most

22:05.247 --> 22:07.652
of the stuff he sold
me for a small penalty.

22:08.103 --> 22:12.157
So now I have no Angelo and no salon.

22:14.056 --> 22:17.104
- I didn't mean for that to happen.
- You interfered.

22:17.162 --> 22:19.823
When Daphne was five years
old and you were struggling

22:19.824 --> 22:22.736
and I came to live with you,
you didn't call it interference.

22:22.737 --> 22:24.844
You called it help.

22:24.982 --> 22:27.307
Well, I'm not struggling anymore.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.114
I don't know, it seems like
it would have been strange

22:42.115 --> 22:45.239
for you to go from that
place to Mission Hills.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.190
You must have experienced
some kind of culture shock.

22:48.995 --> 22:51.599
- Our house wasn't that bad.
- Oh, I'm not talking about the house.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.730
I'm talking about
the environment as a whole.

22:53.925 --> 22:57.214
- She wasn't living in Baghdad, grandma.
- I'm just saying

22:57.215 --> 22:58.565
that the only time you hear

22:58.566 --> 23:00.719
about East Riverside in
the news is for crime.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.239
Mom, could you just
give it a rest, please?

23:04.908 --> 23:07.596
East Riverside has many different parts.

23:07.984 --> 23:10.753
She just can't believe
you survived living there...

23:10.882 --> 23:13.835
- Away from your real people.
- Bay.

23:13.836 --> 23:15.868
I mean, you must have
constantly have been a target

23:15.869 --> 23:18.758
for all those ethnic people
who actually belong there.

23:18.759 --> 23:21.378
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- They were already there.

23:21.379 --> 23:23.520
- I was just pulling them out.
- Bay.

23:23.884 --> 23:24.918
Bay!

23:32.804 --> 23:36.057
- Bay, Bay. Where are you going?
- Anywhere.

23:37.305 --> 23:38.463
You know she tends to

23:38.464 --> 23:41.309
talk before she thinks.
That's just grandma.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.902
- I heard what she said last night.
- Oh no. Honey,

23:44.903 --> 23:46.789
that's not true... any of it.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.420
But the thing is that she's right.

23:49.918 --> 23:51.680
No. No, she's not.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.472
I'm not like her. I'm not like you.

23:54.670 --> 23:57.975
I'm a whole other race.
My name is supposed to be Vasquez.

23:57.976 --> 24:00.190
Grandma is not the last person
who's going to think that

24:00.191 --> 24:03.229
that automatically means
that I'm bad at school

24:03.230 --> 24:05.546
or illegal or whatever.

24:05.547 --> 24:09.186
Mom, I have never had to think
about what that feels like

24:09.278 --> 24:11.159
until now and...

24:12.550 --> 24:13.674
have you?

24:15.724 --> 24:17.797
No. No, wait!

24:18.022 --> 24:20.791
Baby, I'll just get my purse.
We'll get out of here.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.409
No, mom, just stay.

24:23.410 --> 24:24.897
I'll take a cab.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.913
I just want to be alone right now, please.

24:31.498 --> 24:32.874
Oh.

25:32.946 --> 25:34.181
Yes!

25:34.182 --> 25:36.887
- See? Now that is what I'm talking about.
- You like?

25:36.888 --> 25:39.384
Yes! That's what I've been waiting for.

25:40.053 --> 25:41.122
Thank you.

25:41.279 --> 25:45.063
So I have some pretty exciting news.

25:45.158 --> 25:47.566
I got you an audition
for a spot in the lineup

25:47.567 --> 25:49.623
for this year's "Treads & threads."

25:49.624 --> 25:51.344
That charity thing at the speedway?

25:51.345 --> 25:53.045
That's awesome! How did you swing that?

25:53.046 --> 25:54.839
I got skills.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.596
Plus my mom is one of the organizers.

25:57.597 --> 26:00.224
But the talent coordinator
wants to meet with you,

26:00.225 --> 26:01.733
and I was thinking we could

26:01.734 --> 26:04.173
work on your look...
kind of edge it up a bit.

26:04.174 --> 26:07.355
You wanna project something more
serious than "Mission Hills kid"

26:07.356 --> 26:10.828
"who jams with his buddies
from time to time."

26:10.829 --> 26:12.425
Look, we'll go shopping...

26:12.426 --> 26:16.220
- I don't want to go shopping.
- I know guys hate shopping.

26:16.221 --> 26:18.764
No, I don't want a new look.

26:18.824 --> 26:20.567
Well, the event is "Treads & threads."

26:20.568 --> 26:22.685
Clothes are kind of a big part of it.

26:22.686 --> 26:25.191
Is that it or is this just an excuse

26:25.192 --> 26:28.032
for you to mold me into something
that you want me to be?

26:28.033 --> 26:30.272
Mold you? What are you talking ab...

26:31.929 --> 26:34.681
You know, that sounds
very similar to something

26:34.682 --> 26:37.740
that Bay said to me right
before we stopped being friends.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.295
Well yeah, she warned me
that you were like this.

26:41.296 --> 26:43.709
- Like what?
- Controlling?

26:44.049 --> 26:48.026
I told her she was wrong,
but honestly I'm not so sure.

26:48.027 --> 26:51.007
Well, maybe you should ask Bay
to help launch your solo act

26:51.008 --> 26:53.521
and be your girlfriend 'cause I quit.

27:26.162 --> 27:28.850
- Daphne?
- I'm here to play.

27:29.743 --> 27:31.483
Is this another
"Give back to the 'hood" project?

27:31.484 --> 27:35.022
- You get in trouble again?
- No.

27:35.276 --> 27:38.021
- So you're just slumming?
- I'm not slumming.

27:38.022 --> 27:41.516
- I grew up here too.
- But you live in Mission Hills now.

27:41.517 --> 27:45.768
- So?
- So this ain't the "Wizard of Oz."

27:47.013 --> 27:48.558
You can't go home again.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.744
- Oh!
- Oh hi.

28:12.745 --> 28:15.171
I told myself I was going
to read one chapter,

28:15.172 --> 28:17.591
and that was four chapters ago.

28:19.593 --> 28:21.973
I need to talk with you, mom.

28:25.295 --> 28:28.344
I just... I don't understand this.

28:28.345 --> 28:30.582
I don't understand any of this.

28:30.900 --> 28:34.612
I... I'm so sorry about what happened.

28:34.807 --> 28:38.097
But you had such a special
relationship with her.

28:38.098 --> 28:40.751
How could a little blood
test change all that?

28:40.808 --> 28:41.956
Okay look,

28:42.600 --> 28:45.403
you can judge me all you want
for saying this out loud,

28:45.404 --> 28:49.317
but I know that the minute
that blood test came back

28:49.324 --> 28:51.269
you looked at her differently too.

28:52.477 --> 28:53.955
I didn't. That's crazy.

28:53.956 --> 28:57.205
I mean why would I?

28:57.486 --> 29:00.881
Because she's not your D.N.A.

29:01.191 --> 29:04.322
Daphne is. You carried her.

29:04.355 --> 29:07.934
Regina carried Bay.
She has the connection with Bay

29:07.935 --> 29:10.091
that you are never gonna have.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.810
You carried me.

29:15.717 --> 29:17.779
We share the same D.N.A.

29:18.802 --> 29:20.205
And right now

29:20.294 --> 29:23.345
I couldn't feel any less connected to you.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.611
That is ridiculous.

29:36.639 --> 29:39.099
The thing is
it's the opposite of the truth.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.765
What does that even mean?

29:40.888 --> 29:43.906
I feel so much closer to Bay than Daphne,

29:43.907 --> 29:46.454
- and I carried Daphne.
- Of course you do.

29:46.455 --> 29:48.658
Bay's been with us for 16 years.

29:48.659 --> 29:51.038
Daphne sometimes feels
like a stranger to me

29:51.039 --> 29:54.217
even though she's my flesh and blood.
It's just... it's...

29:54.250 --> 29:57.370
- it's all mixed up.
- You know what's mixed up? What's mixed up

29:57.371 --> 29:58.408
is that your mother has

29:58.409 --> 30:00.440
this huge problem with the fact
that Bay is Puerto Rican.

30:00.441 --> 30:03.349
Okay? You and I do not have that problem.

30:03.350 --> 30:04.903
End of story.

30:08.388 --> 30:10.734
You remember when Felipe

30:10.735 --> 30:14.140
and his crew were
painting the dining room?

30:14.141 --> 30:16.430
- Yeah?
- I locked up the silver.

30:16.431 --> 30:19.369
But when that electrician...
who was white...

30:20.256 --> 30:23.425
was there to fix
the dimmer switch on the chandelier,

30:23.726 --> 30:25.721
I didn't even think about the silver.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.724
So what does that say about me?

30:29.742 --> 30:30.935
I don't know.

30:31.214 --> 30:32.763
But I tell you one thing:

30:32.975 --> 30:35.370
your mother would never have welcomed

30:35.371 --> 30:37.589
Regina and Adrianna into her home,

30:37.913 --> 30:40.779
and made them both feel like
they're part of her family.

30:41.232 --> 30:44.699
That's something you did.
You're not your mother.

30:45.224 --> 30:47.539
Never will be. And you know what else?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.846
I'm buying your mom out of the car wash.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.273
- Uh, you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

30:52.274 --> 30:54.581
What makes you think that
she's going to let you?

30:54.582 --> 30:57.599
I'm going to give her double
the value for her shares.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.712
And it'll be worth it to give
her one less reason to visit us.

31:00.804 --> 31:03.784
Hey, she is my mother.

31:04.172 --> 31:07.193
Yeah, and Bay is our daughter.

31:07.194 --> 31:09.598
And if your mother does
not have the decency

31:09.599 --> 31:11.339
to give our daughter some consideration

31:11.340 --> 31:14.608
then I don't feel like
I have to give her any either.

31:14.850 --> 31:17.256
And I'm giving her
the check tomorrow morning

31:17.257 --> 31:18.955
Right before she leaves.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.518
- You know what?
- Hmm?

31:27.061 --> 31:28.724
Let me give it to her.

31:35.375 --> 31:37.945
- Oh.
- Can I come in?

31:38.574 --> 31:39.942
Yeah.

31:46.689 --> 31:49.200
- There you go.
- Thanks.

31:49.861 --> 31:51.616
- Is that cinnamon?
- Mm-hmm.

31:51.617 --> 31:55.797
It's how they serve it at
my favorite bakery in East Riverside...

31:55.852 --> 31:57.289
Mexican style.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.062
I probably should have
already known that, huh?

32:02.139 --> 32:05.145
I didn't until I discovered it.

32:06.337 --> 32:08.119
Being latina is not some sort of program

32:08.120 --> 32:10.425
you can download into
your brain like in "The matrix."

32:10.426 --> 32:12.721
First Emmett with "Aliens"
and now you with "The matrix."

32:12.722 --> 32:15.650
I have got to watch more sci-fi.

32:16.489 --> 32:18.298
It's a culture.

32:18.677 --> 32:21.321
I mean, you live it

32:21.603 --> 32:22.982
and learn about it.

32:24.638 --> 32:28.727
I've known about being part
Puerto Rican for a little while now,

32:29.996 --> 32:31.609
and I guess I never thought
about what it meant

32:31.610 --> 32:34.634
until I heard grandma say what she said.

32:34.635 --> 32:36.880
Most of the time when
people say things like this

32:36.881 --> 32:41.787
it's more ignorance than out of meanness.

32:42.317 --> 32:45.654
You are taking this way
better than I thought.

32:46.823 --> 32:48.983
When Daphne got her first hearing aids

32:48.984 --> 32:50.698
and we were learning to sign,

32:51.266 --> 32:53.869
people would just stare.

32:54.151 --> 32:55.586
It made me so angry.

32:55.587 --> 32:58.115
I would say "What are you
looking at? She's deaf!"

32:59.182 --> 33:02.132
But it didn't make me feel any better

33:02.133 --> 33:05.473
and they still stared.

33:06.416 --> 33:08.998
- So I should just ignore grandma?
- No.

33:10.152 --> 33:11.371
I don't know her well enough

33:11.372 --> 33:13.971
to tell you what you could
say to change her mind.

33:14.265 --> 33:16.178
What would you say?

33:16.504 --> 33:19.188
A few choice words that aren't
appropriate for children.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.166
Everybody is different.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.804
And unfortunately,

33:24.805 --> 33:28.373
you are going to have to deal
with this again in your future.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.900
You'll learn what works best for you

33:31.291 --> 33:33.649
and you will deal with it.

33:38.456 --> 33:40.297
Can I ask you another favor?

33:52.079 --> 33:53.644
Let me see your sketch again.

33:59.936 --> 34:02.158
Do you think we can fix it by tomorrow?

34:03.511 --> 34:04.605
Sure.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.801
It's gonna take us awhile though.

34:08.681 --> 34:09.943
Better get to work.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.561
- What?
- It's just that

34:17.562 --> 34:20.342
no one in my family's ever
painted with me before.

34:22.771 --> 34:25.991
Well, we'll see how much help I am.

34:26.353 --> 34:28.178
I'm a little rusty, you know.

34:30.952 --> 34:32.077
Come on.

34:50.067 --> 34:51.612
Good morning, darling.

34:52.306 --> 34:53.487
Good morning.

35:06.818 --> 35:07.907
Hey.

35:09.148 --> 35:12.498
So what's so secret you
had to drag me out here?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.722
My phone's not tapped, you know.

35:14.886 --> 35:17.992
It's not secret, but I did
want to talk to you in person.

35:24.713 --> 35:26.373
I'm sorry about the other day.

35:26.466 --> 35:28.711
How could you you let Bay
poison the well between us?

35:28.712 --> 35:31.073
Look, let's just leave her out of this.

35:32.734 --> 35:36.356
I'm glad that you ** me
to go on my own with my music.

35:37.237 --> 35:39.223
There's a "But" coming.

35:39.708 --> 35:43.313
But I've been dressing
myself since I was three.

35:44.728 --> 35:47.289
Okay, I got a little carried away.

35:47.290 --> 35:51.163
From now on, my music is my business.

35:51.575 --> 35:53.243
I know that's it's
your business. I never...

35:53.244 --> 35:55.816
No, all of it. My songs,

35:55.817 --> 35:58.228
my look, my gigs...

35:59.309 --> 36:00.900
I'll take care of it.

36:01.737 --> 36:04.945
Gee, am I still allowed to hear you play?

36:07.367 --> 36:09.298
I always play better when you're there.

36:11.808 --> 36:13.279
Are you still my girlfriend?

36:15.572 --> 36:16.788
That depends.

36:16.789 --> 36:18.590
I can't dress you.

36:19.284 --> 36:22.302
But can I undress you?

36:41.631 --> 36:42.677
What's this?

36:42.678 --> 36:45.827
I'm moving in with
Gloria in East Riverside.

36:48.534 --> 36:51.262
- You're moving out?
- I think we both need a break.

36:52.663 --> 36:54.433
You need some space.

36:58.395 --> 37:00.802
Fine. Did you tell Daphne?

37:01.490 --> 37:03.089
Not yet, but I will.

37:03.898 --> 37:05.665
I'll be out by tonight.

37:18.540 --> 37:19.630
Hi.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.358
Mmm, I love that quote.

37:29.295 --> 37:30.476
Here.

37:32.804 --> 37:35.472
- You took it back from Daphne?
- No no.

37:35.473 --> 37:37.124
She gave it back to me.

37:37.785 --> 37:39.572
She said she didn't feel right keeping it

37:39.573 --> 37:42.121
when it really belonged to you.

37:42.439 --> 37:43.533
She's right.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.831
Why? I don't have freckles
and I don't make good grades.

37:47.879 --> 37:49.927
Please, your mom already yelled at me.

37:52.248 --> 37:53.881
So will you take it?

37:57.535 --> 37:59.969
Grandma, do you really
see me differently now?

38:00.754 --> 38:02.979
Don't you see yourself differently?

38:03.954 --> 38:06.595
This whole experience
has been hardest on you.

38:08.658 --> 38:11.085
Although it hasn't been that
easy for the rest of us.

38:13.581 --> 38:15.602
I love you so much, cookie.

38:16.206 --> 38:19.489
I'm so sorry I hurt your feelings.

38:37.843 --> 38:39.310
I hope you keep it.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.524
Regina?

39:04.127 --> 39:05.512
Is everything all right?

39:05.779 --> 39:08.579
I just saw Adrianna with suitcases.

39:11.595 --> 39:14.627
I was so angry at her for
what she did to Angelo.

39:15.357 --> 39:17.149
I thought I wanted her gone.

39:18.913 --> 39:20.751
She makes me crazy but...

39:25.232 --> 39:26.714
But she's your mom.

39:33.430 --> 39:34.688
I'll put these in the trunk, grandma.

39:34.689 --> 39:36.667
Thanks, honey. Now make sure that

39:36.668 --> 39:39.805
that fertilizer you get
is for acid-loving plants.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.360
Those shrubs along the fence
are just screaming for it.

39:42.361 --> 39:44.919
I heard you the first time. Look, mom,

39:44.920 --> 39:47.779
I didn't mean to spring this on
you on your way out the door,

39:47.780 --> 39:51.048
but John and I were talking
about the car washes and...

39:51.049 --> 39:53.354
Oh. I already talked to
John about the car wash.

39:53.355 --> 39:54.959
- You did?
- Yeah, I gave him

39:54.960 --> 39:57.267
the mock-ups for the green
advertising campaign.

39:57.268 --> 39:59.025
Would you make sure he looks it over?

39:59.026 --> 40:01.311
- M-mo...
- There they are!

40:01.600 --> 40:03.200
Bye, grandma Bonnie. Have a safe flight.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.030
Thanks, honey. I will.

40:05.031 --> 40:07.270
I can't wait to see you
girls in Scottsdale.

40:07.403 --> 40:09.741
I can't wait to show you around
East Riverside next time.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.011
Oooh.

40:12.898 --> 40:14.149
Bye, cookie.

40:18.294 --> 40:19.513
Bye, grandma.

40:23.733 --> 40:24.820
Goodbye.

40:27.432 --> 40:28.728
This is for you.

40:31.824 --> 40:34.501
It's your share of the car washes.

40:34.547 --> 40:36.382
We wanted to pay you back.

40:37.190 --> 40:38.901
John and I appreciate your investment,

40:38.902 --> 40:41.827
but we can handle it from now on.

40:42.871 --> 40:45.027
Hey, grandma, we don't want to be late.

40:45.477 --> 40:46.918
Oh, right.

40:51.515 --> 40:54.464
- Thank you for everything.
- Bye, Katy.

40:54.465 --> 40:55.622
Bye, mom.

40:57.316 --> 40:59.165
- Call me when you get there.
- Yeah.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.942
Oh, did I miss the fireworks?

41:07.640 --> 41:09.828
No, no fireworks.

41:30.241 --> 41:31.736
Thanks mi amor.

41:32.797 --> 41:34.158
I think that's everything.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.253
We've only been gone a few months ago

41:43.254 --> 41:45.261
and it's already gotten worse around here.

41:46.578 --> 41:48.200
It looks the same.

41:48.522 --> 41:51.813
You're just seeing it through
Mission Hills eyes now.

41:54.793 --> 41:56.394
Do you think I've changed?

41:57.349 --> 41:59.527
Changed? How?

42:02.225 --> 42:04.683
Everyone keeps telling me

42:04.684 --> 42:08.095
I'm this or I'm that or
I should be this or I should be that...

42:08.096 --> 42:09.980
Don't listen to them.

42:11.301 --> 42:12.659
I wasn't confused

42:12.660 --> 42:14.116
when it was just you and me and mom,

42:14.117 --> 42:16.963
but then we moved to Mission Hills

42:16.964 --> 42:19.059
and Angelo came back

42:19.060 --> 42:22.008
and now you're moving out and...

42:22.825 --> 42:25.095
I'm just going to be across town.

42:26.642 --> 42:27.835
Listen to me:

42:29.056 --> 42:31.107
your zip code changed,

42:31.108 --> 42:32.240
you didn't.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.830
You're Daphne Vasquez.

42:37.655 --> 42:38.984
Do you understand?
