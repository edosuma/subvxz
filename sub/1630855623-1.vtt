Is the wine OK?
It's fine.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.040
What's that?

00:42.560 --> 00:46.040
Grace, I want us to start over.
I love you.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.360
You were with someone else.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.000
How do you expect me
to trust you again?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.040
Gracie.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.880
You've got to let me try.

SHE SNIFFS

01:15.000 --> 01:16.520
I am so sorry.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.160
Thanks for walking me to my car. Yeah.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.760
This is nice.
It is.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.920
Can I call you tomorrow?
Jason...

01:30.920 --> 01:34.160
Just come home.
I'm ready to try again.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.840
ENGINE STARTS UP

01:38.120 --> 01:39.200
Come here.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.440
TYRES SCREECH,
BOTH CRY OUT

01:55.400 --> 01:58.120
{\an8}You'll have to do better than that.
First one to the top wins.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.120
{\an8}THEY GIGGLE

02:01.120 --> 02:03.360
{\an8}Oh!
SHE GIGGLES

02:03.360 --> 02:04.440
{\an8}Victory!

02:04.440 --> 02:06.560
{\an8}I'm gonna miss this.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.120
{\an8}Mom.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.840
{\an8}What? This is where we used
to have your birthday parties

02:10.840 --> 02:11.880
{\an8}when you were little.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.880
{\an8}I've come to love
our morning runs here.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.640
{\an8}Hey, we said no tears.
I'm only moving 15 minutes away.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.720
{\an8}Just wait until you're a mother,
you'll understand.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.040
{\an8}Bright side, you can start running
with Dad again.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.360
{\an8}Your father hates to run.
He hates to lose.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.000
{\an8}Maybe I should let him win, too.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
{\an8}Hey, I won, fair and square.
Race you home?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.160
{\an8}Go!

02:39.520 --> 02:42.520
{\an8}Morning, Sam.
Liz, Christina, good morning.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.040
You just don't think
you can run without me.

OK.
LIZ CHUCKLES

02:50.680 --> 02:51.760
There you are.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.720
Hey, sweetheart.
You said you'd come running with us.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.920
I'm sorry. I just got caught up
with the case and all...

02:59.560 --> 03:02.920
OK.
I just can't keep up with you two.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.840
At least stay for breakfast?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.160
And before you say no,
just remember, I'm moving out.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.080
Wait. You finally found a roommate?

03:09.080 --> 03:11.520
I'm meeting
a few more candidates today,

03:11.520 --> 03:14.400
but I might hang some more flyers
on campus, just to be safe.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.720
Sweetheart, we can cover
the other half of the rent

03:16.720 --> 03:18.480
until you find somebody.
Thank you.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.480
But I'm sure it'll work out.
Come on. Stay.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.040
Mom's making pancakes.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.080
Twenty minutes.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.480
Thank you, Liz.
These were delicious.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.200
Yeah, thanks, Mom.
You're welcome, sweetie.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.280
It's amazing you found time
to fill these baking orders.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.360
Luckily, Christina helped.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.920
What are you gonna do
when I move out?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.600
You can't do all this by yourself.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.440
Well, maybe it's time
I hired some help.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.520
Dad can help.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.720
I guess you didn't tell her.
Tell me what?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.840
Your dad's up for managing partner.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.920
SHE SCREAMS
That's fantastic!

03:55.920 --> 03:57.760
Will you hire me
as summer associate?

03:57.760 --> 04:01.960
Oh, my God. I love you.
But it's not a done deal. Yet.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.840
Which is why I won't have
much free time.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.200
So I'm sorry I can't help more, Liz.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.280
It's OK. Sam offered to pitch in
until I find someone.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.320
Sam's helping out, huh?

04:13.320 --> 04:17.040
He wanted to thank me for baking
Stacy's sweet sixteen cake.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.640
Oh, which reminds me.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.440
Christina, you still haven't told me
what you want for your birthday.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.680
You know I live for chocolate.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.520
But you're keeping this party
simple, right?

04:24.520 --> 04:28.080
A few friends, finger foods...
Small and tasteful.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.520
Please be sure that this party's
on your calendar.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.920
Mom, come on.
He'll be here if he can.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.080
I have to get to class.
Bye, sweetie.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.440
Love you guys.
Love you, too.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.240
Have a good day.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.360
Do you have to put me
on the spot like that?

04:43.360 --> 04:45.600
I just don't want her
to be disappointed.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.280
Well, Liz, she's a big girl now.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.280
And she understands the pressure
that I'm under.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.160
And I don't? I barely have time
to plan her party.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.880
That's because
you're taking on too much.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.760
I thought this baking thing
was a hobby.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.560
It's not a hobby, Noah. It's my job.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.160
And you said you supported it.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.160
And I do, Liz,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.920
but this promotion is more than
just putting in the hours.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.360
I've got dinners.
I've got functions.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.280
I'll need you there.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.840
And I can't do both?
KNOCK ON DOOR

05:15.960 --> 05:17.120
Morning, Noah.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.200
Sam.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.080
So, where can I start?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.960
Um, can you fold bakery boxes?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.120
You got it.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.920
You should go,
or you're gonna be late. Right.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.120
Is everything OK?
Yeah.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.800
Hey.
Hey.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.440
You're putting up more flyers?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.160
Still looking
for that perfect roommate.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.280
Babe, I'm here for you.
You know I'm a good cook, too.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.320
SHE CHUCKLES

06:00.320 --> 06:03.000
We've only been dating a couple
of months, you can't move in.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.440
So I'll spend the night, right?
I'll think about it.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.800
Think about it? Think about this.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.440
Don't you have a class?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.920
Careful. A lot of weirdos out there.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.320
So, my boyfriend was cheating on me
with one of my sorority sisters.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.720
And there's no way that I'm gonna
keep living with that slut

06:31.720 --> 06:33.680
in the Kappa Beta Kappa house.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.440
Uh, so you're looking
for a new place to live?

06:36.440 --> 06:39.600
And that's why I like cats
more than I like humans.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.440
Ah, OK. And you own a lot of cats?

06:41.440 --> 06:46.160
Well, I prefer to say I cohabitate.
You're not allergic, are you?

06:46.160 --> 06:48.320
Hi. Just a second.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.960
Sorry.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.720
Christina, right?
Yeah.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.000
I'm Alyssa.
It's so nice to meet you.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.840
You as well. So, you said
on the phone you just moved here?

07:05.840 --> 07:10.800
That's right. Needed a fresh start.
Bad break-up.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.880
He was kind of a jerk,
so it wasn't hard getting over him.

07:13.880 --> 07:17.280
His loss. So, was it difficult
transferring schools?

07:17.280 --> 07:19.920
Oh, I'm not a student.
I saw your ad at a cafe.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.480
Oh, which one?
This cafe.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.200
It's right next door to the hospital
I volunteer at.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.280
I love this place.
We study here all the time.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.560
That's really sweet that
you volunteer at the hospital,

07:30.560 --> 07:31.840
by the way.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.960
I spent a lot of time at hospitals
when I was a kid.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.800
Oh, were you sick?
My dad. Pancreatic cancer.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.360
During his treatments,
the nurses would take care of me.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.760
We'd play poker, eat ice cream,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.920
which made everything
a little less scary.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.280
And now you volunteer.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.560
Yeah. I understand what people
are going through,

07:50.560 --> 07:54.080
and I wanna try to make it easier,
if I can.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.080
Plus,
I'm a pretty good poker shark now.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.960
Good to know.
Tell me about you.

07:58.960 --> 08:03.440
I'm a law student. First year.
I wanna fight for the underdog.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.760
Like my dad used to do

08:04.760 --> 08:07.440
before he had to go
into corporate law to pay the bills.

08:07.440 --> 08:11.400
Um, so, I do have to ask,
just cos we're splitting the rent,

08:11.400 --> 08:12.720
you work, right?

08:12.720 --> 08:15.320
Oh, yeah. I'm a personal trainer.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.960
I work as an office temp.
I even walk dogs.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.600
I know that doesn't sound
very ambitious,

08:21.600 --> 08:24.880
but the truth is,
I always wanted to get married.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.120
Have that perfect family.
No judgment.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.920
My mom loved being a housewife.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.120
And now she runs a bakery business
out of her house.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.159
That's amazing!
Your mom sounds really smart.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.960
Thanks. She is.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.840
So, the apartment
is actually just off campus.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.080
Do you wanna walk over
and check it out?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.320
I'd love to.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.440
You're in early. Trying to give me
a run for managing partner?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.040
Worried?
Not really.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.960
I signed two new clients
before breakfast.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.760
Good morning, Patricia. Morning.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.200
Thank you very much.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.800
Any messages?
On your desk.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.640
Can you call the florist for me?
Oh, boy. What'd you do now?

09:05.640 --> 09:08.600
Send roses. Two dozen.
That bad, huh?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.760
Mr Ellis needs Carson's file.
It wasn't on your desk.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.320
I've got it right here.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
I think I found a loophole
for the non-competes.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.240
A loophole that could win the case?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.320
We wouldn't even have
to go to trial.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.000
Carson's son let it slip.
He's adopted.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.920
And if I find the right precedent,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.080
he could form the company independently.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.960
And then Carson can finally kick
his partner to the kerb.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.600
Bingo.
You gonna pitch it to Ellis?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.880
Just gonna grab the file.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.080
HE SIGHS

09:42.080 --> 09:43.440
After reviewing it this morning,

09:43.440 --> 09:45.360
Christina must have
accidentally taken it.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.840
Then you better get it.
Ellis is due in court in an hour.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.840
HE SIGHS

09:51.880 --> 09:54.280
Come on in. Sorry about the mess.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.000
So, there's two bedrooms. You can
have the bigger one, if you want.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.160
It looks like
you've barely moved in.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.280
I like your couch.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.880
I'm in the process.
Tonight's my first night.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.960
Let's see.
What else can I tell you?

10:05.960 --> 10:08.400
There is a laundry facility
in the building.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.880
And a gym.
A gym? Perfect.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.200
I could use it
for my personal training clients.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.640
So you like it?

10:17.160 --> 10:20.760
Well, I mean,
it could use a little personality.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.000
Maybe some art.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.600
I have a really big painting
that would look great over there

10:24.600 --> 10:26.240
and another one right over here.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.920
One that would be perfect there.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.080
And there, maybe some wallpaper.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.720
How do you feel
about decorative pillows?

10:32.720 --> 10:34.960
Um...
Oh.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.800
Sorry.
We haven't made this official.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.400
If you need more time...

10:39.880 --> 10:41.040
When can you move in?

10:41.040 --> 10:43.080
SHE SQUEALS

10:43.080 --> 10:46.400
Thank you!
I've been looking for a while.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.960
You wouldn't believe
how many weirdos are out there.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.640
Um, actually I would.
PHONE CHIMES

10:50.640 --> 10:53.680
Oh, no. Oh.
Bad news?

10:53.680 --> 10:57.280
Er, yeah.
I think I have a file my dad needs.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.400
There it is. Damn.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.920
His office is downtown,
and I have class in 20 minutes.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.400
I can take it to him.
I have the day free.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.000
I can't ask you to do that.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.920
I'm offering. You just helped me out
in a really big way.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.760
Listen.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.960
Today's the anniversary
of losing my father.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.400
And...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.320
No, it's OK. It happened
a long time ago. I was a kid.

11:22.320 --> 11:27.000
But when the date comes up,
I like to stay busy.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.360
It helps, you know.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.240
Of course. I mean, thank you.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.320
I'll text you the address. Great.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.280
Hello. I'm here to see Noah Davis.
Your name?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.840
Alyssa Winters.
His daughter, Christina, sent me.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.840
I'm sorry. Christina sent you?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.480
Yes.
She said her father needed this.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.520
Oh, thanks. I'll give it to him.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.200
I told Christina I would
give it to him, personally.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.080
I'm Mr Davis's assistant.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.560
Then you can show me to his office.
Follow me.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.600
Noah, someone to see you.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.760
Mr Davis?
Can I help you?

12:17.760 --> 12:19.680
I'm Alyssa,
Christina's new roommate.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.320
She said you needed this.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.960
Her new roommate?

12:22.960 --> 12:25.520
As of 30 minutes ago.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.520
Christina had a class, so I offered
to bring over the file.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.200
Well, thank you.
That's very generous.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
My pleasure.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.640
This is a really nice office.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.720
You must be the best attorney
they have.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.280
Second best!
Peter Buchanan. And you are?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.640
You should stop by for dinner.
You and your wife.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.160
Once Christina and I get settled.
Of course.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.240
Well, I'll get out of your hair.
It was really nice meeting you.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.000
Likewise, um... Alyssa.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.920
Right. Thanks again for the files.

And she's inviting you to dinner.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.280
Morning, Mr Ellis. Morning.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.040
If you're heading to the courthouse,
I can give you a ride.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.240
Thank you, Peter.
Patricia said you wanted to see me.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.800
Yes, sir.
It's about the Carson case.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.520
Peter, why don't you head down
and bring the car around?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.960
This'll just take a moment. Mm.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.400

in my brand-new apartment...

Well, you really went all out,
didn't you?

I promised I wouldn't,
but I can't help myself.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.120
So, what did you decide?

14:06.120 --> 14:07.600
About what?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
About the bakery.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.920
Did you talk to Noah?
You said you were ready.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.160
We've barely had time
to talk about anything.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.600
If we're not working,
we're wining and dining his clients,

14:18.600 --> 14:20.840
so I guess it'll have to wait.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.120
Why does it have to wait?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.080
I have a friend
in commercial real estate.

when my wife died.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.720
I couldn't have made it through
without you. Please.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.640
Let me just return the favour.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.600
You already are.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.840
I couldn't have made it

wasn't for another hour.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.200
Uh, Liz needed some help setting up. So...

15:23.800 --> 15:26.440
I'm not feeling up to it.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.160
Are you OK?

15:29.920 --> 15:33.320
I was unpacking,
and I found some old photos.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.800
Of my ex.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.520
I wasn't completely honest
when I said I was over him.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.160
Did he cheat on you?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.280
He cheated on his wife.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.000
So he was married.
I didn't know.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.960
Doctors
don't always wear their rings.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.440
He was a doctor
and you were a volunteer?

That doesn't sound fair.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.240
When I found out the truth,
I finally broke it off.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.800
He lost it and filed
a harassment claim with HR.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.200
Hey, you know what?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.400
The best way to get over him
is to get back out there.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.800
Marcus is bringing his roommate
to the party tonight.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.840

I saw you at registration this week.

You're a nurse, right?
I'm just a volunteer.

against doctors?

Not at all.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.000
OK. Well, um, how about
we get some coffee sometime?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.280
I don't think so.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.880
Eee, nice.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.200
I'm an idiot. Her ex was a doctor,
and it did not end well.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.680
Just let me talk to her.
Nah, it's...

17:30.680 --> 17:33.920
Don't worry about it, man.
She's new. It's OK.

Hi. Happy birthday.

Oh, honey. Do you know
if any of these have peanuts?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.280
Oh, right. Your allergy.
Give me a minute and I'll check.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.560

Well, I'm... I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.560
Absolutely.
Alyssa...

Craig was a doctor.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.400
Of course.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.880
And, um... Here. Ah...

25:12.880 --> 25:16.880
No, thank you for trying to help
with the party today.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.160
I really appreciate that.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.120
Good night, Mr Davis.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.160
Noah.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.680
Noah.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.160
DOOR CLOSES

25:41.440 --> 25:44.720
What is all this?
Surprise.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.600
I can't believe you did all this.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.320
I'm sorry. I never should have
left your party.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.920
This more than makes up for it.
I'll be right back.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.960
Mm. Smells so good.
My compliments to the chef.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.160
Oh, look. Here. In your hair.
Thank you.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.960
I'm starving.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.560
Well, uh, let's eat.
Where's Mom?

26:08.560 --> 26:10.040
She had a rush order to fill.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.320
Pretty soon she's gonna have to open
her own bakery.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.800
Dad, she could have ten bakeries,

26:14.800 --> 26:17.160
none of it matters if she thinks
you don't support her.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.040
Fine. What's your advice?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.520
All she's ever wanted
is to spend more time with you.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.080
And you know what she loves doing
almost as much as baking?

26:27.080 --> 26:29.640
No. Anything but that.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.680
My mom has been begging him
to go running with her,

26:31.680 --> 26:34.160
but he is always finding excuses.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.520
What is running gonna fix?

26:35.520 --> 26:38.640
It's a romantic gesture.
Way better than flowers.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.240
OK. Well, I'm not exactly
in the best shape, so...

26:41.240 --> 26:43.520
All you have to do
is rebuild your stamina.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.840
Alyssa's a personal trainer.
She can help you get back in shape.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.240
I don't know.
It'll be easy.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.120
Two weeks.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.800
We'll start early,
so it doesn't interfere with work.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.960
Come on. For Mom.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.640
OK. How hard could it be?

27:05.600 --> 27:08.400
Pace yourself.
HE GROANS

27:10.840 --> 27:12.800
Noah.
Yeah.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.400
Maybe we should take a break.
I'm good.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.040
You don't wanna hurt yourself.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.960
OK. We're stopping.
MACHINE BEEPS

27:24.360 --> 27:27.800
You weren't kidding when you said
you were out of shape.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.400
And I thought I was getting faster.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.120
We've only been training
a couple of days.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.960
We'll get there.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.320
Well... I need to get faster.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.200
Easy, tiger.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.680
Running with your wife
isn't likely to fix your marriage.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.040
But you're a good guy for trying.
Maybe Liz is right.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.280
She mentioned seeing a therapist.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.720
My parents did.
Yeah? Did it help?

27:52.720 --> 27:56.400
It made things worse. Great.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.440
I was relieved
when they got a divorce.

27:58.440 --> 28:03.200
Ah. I don't want a divorce.
I love my wife.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.280
My dad loved my mom.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.160
He tried so hard,
but nothing was ever good enough.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.640
She couldn't see how perfect he was.
So she left him.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.800
Eventually, he found someone else.
Someone better.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.960
He was finally happy.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.160
You deserve to be happy, too.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.080
I got a busy day.
I should get to the office.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.720
Noah, wait.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.600
Oh, your lunch is here.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.920
I didn't order anything.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.200
The delivery guy said
it was for you.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.960
From who?
Something about a promotion?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.640
I mean, Patricia,

28:47.640 --> 28:49.560
you are always sticking
your business cards

28:49.560 --> 28:51.200
in these "win a free lunch" bowls.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.160
True.
But this is Chinese chicken salad.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.560
I can't eat this.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.360
Here, you take it.
I already ate.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.400
But it says "no peanuts"
on the receipt.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.200
Huh. It does.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.120
Well, who said there's
no such thing as a free lunch?

29:07.440 --> 29:11.240
OK. We got everything done.
I can't believe it.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.200
I think this was
your biggest sales day yet.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.040
It felt like it.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.880
Hey. What if I were
to loan you the money?

29:17.880 --> 29:19.440
I couldn't ask you to do that.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.880
No. I could underwrite the business
till you're ready to take it over.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.640
That's very kind of you, Sam.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.880
Well,
I believe in what you're doing.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.440
I can tell you have talent.
And that shouldn't be stifled.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.720
Just think about it, that's all.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.480
I will. Great.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.040
Hey, Noah.
Thank you, Patricia.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.200
Are you feeling OK?
I don't know.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.120
Maybe I'm coming down
with something.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.480
All right. Why don't you go home?
Get some rest.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.600
Yeah.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.960
Patricia! Somebody get help!

30:07.960 --> 30:10.160
Call 911!

30:10.160 --> 30:12.360
Hang in there, Patricia.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.360
Noah, hold her head.
Is she allergic to anything?

30:15.360 --> 30:17.640
Peanuts.
Does anyone have an EpiPen?

30:17.640 --> 30:20.240
{\an8}I think she has one in her purse.
Go get it.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.200
{\an8}Her pulse is racing.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.640
{\an8}Airway is closed.
She's going into anaphylactic shock.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.400
{\an8}Hold her head back.
I have to try to open up her airway.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.680
Patricia?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.120
Here you go.
Hold on, Patricia.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.920
{\an8}You're gonna be OK.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.400
Noah.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.480
Noah.
Liz.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.360
I called the office and heard about
Patricia. How is she?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.520
She's, uh... She's OK.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.960
Oh, thank goodness. How are you?

30:56.960 --> 30:58.920
We haven't really spoken
since the party.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.960
Liz, I can't get into this
right now.

31:00.960 --> 31:05.280
Yeah. Do you still want me to join
you for your client dinner tonight?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.640
It got rescheduled.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.800
OK. I'll see you at home?
We'll talk then.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.440
OK.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.520
You're still here?
How is she?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.320
The doctors say she'll be fine.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.360
How'd you know how to do that?

31:31.360 --> 31:33.680
I volunteer with children.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.160
Kids are in hospital all the time
with allergic reactions.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.200
Patricia is so careful.
I should sue that restaurant.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.720
I'm sure it was just an accident.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.560
That's no excuse. She could have
been killed if you weren't here.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.120
Why are you here?

31:53.400 --> 31:56.960
I wanted to apologise
for this morning. I overstepped.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.640
Well, I should call
Patricia's husband and...

32:02.640 --> 32:04.320
I need to get somebody
to cover the desk.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.760
I can do it.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.520
I can just call my temp agency

32:07.520 --> 32:09.600
and have them assign me here
for as long as you need.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.640
Is there anything you can't do?

32:24.960 --> 32:27.360
I updated your calendar
for the rest of the week.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.920
Thank you.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.720
You seem to be burring the candle
at both ends.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.320
You didn't even touch your lunch.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.680
I am so sorry. I should have sent
you home hours ago.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.480
Do you like Chinese?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.000
Huh.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.400
Wow. Thank you for this.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.360
I didn't even realise
how hungry I was.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.760
Need me to prepare anything
for tomorrow?

32:52.760 --> 32:58.720
Uh, no. We can go over it
on our run tomorrow.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.960
Thought I scared you off.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.360
I didn't want you to be right.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.040
I think I'm avoiding going home
cos I...

33:07.040 --> 33:08.680
I just can't talk to Liz,

33:08.680 --> 33:11.600
and this idea
of a romantic gesture...

33:11.600 --> 33:13.360
HE SIGHS

33:13.360 --> 33:16.520
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
delaying the inevitable.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.440
At least you can say
you went down fighting.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.480
My ex never even tried
to fight for us.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.000
I thought he was the perfect guy.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.240
No such thing.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.440
If you don't want to go home,
I could get you a hotel room.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.080
I heard the Walden's nice.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.960
A room at the Walden is tempting,
but, uh...

33:37.960 --> 33:39.000
I should go home.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.320
Liz'll probably be asleep, anyways.
Don't worry. I'll clean this up.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.640
OK.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.120
Um, you think you could stay on
for a few more days?

33:50.120 --> 33:52.240
Patricia should be back
by the end of the week.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.640
So soon?

33:53.640 --> 33:55.880
They're releasing her
from the hospital tomorrow.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.280
I'll be happy to cover for her.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.320
Thank you.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.360
My pleasure.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.199
DOOR CREAKS

34:21.199 --> 34:23.440
MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
Alyssa?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.400
I didn't know the volunteers
worked this late.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.520
Well, the kids are here 24-7.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.280
Some have trouble sleeping,
so I keep them company.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.960
Oh, so you work
on the children's ward?

34:40.960 --> 34:43.719
What are you doing on this floor?

34:43.719 --> 34:46.199
Coffee break. Care to join?

34:48.159 --> 34:49.600
I thought you hated doctors.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.120
SHE CHUCKLES
I was rude at the party.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.880
Christina said
you're worth getting to know.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.200
Well, my shift ends
in about ten minutes.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.960
I'll meet you at the cafe next door?
Sure.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.480
Oh, hey.
What did you tell him about my ex?

35:15.480 --> 35:16.760
What?

35:16.760 --> 35:18.720
He knew I moved here
to get away from Jason.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.520
Did you tell him that
Jason was married, too?

35:22.200 --> 35:25.880
Who?
Craig. I just had coffee with him.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.640
I only said it was a bad break-up.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.480
Well, you shouldn't
have said anything.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.560
You're right. I'm sorry.
Did you tell him my dad died, too?

35:33.560 --> 35:34.880
What? No.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.040
That I was just a child
when I lost him?

35:37.040 --> 35:39.160
Alyssa, I'm so sorry.
Don't feel bad for me.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.840
I don't need that.
I need you to listen. OK?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.120
I told you I wasn't ready.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.640
And now I have to go on a date
with Craig

35:44.640 --> 35:46.360
so he doesn't twist things
at the hospital

35:46.360 --> 35:47.800
and tell people I'm damaged goods.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.240
He would never do that.
Don't! You've done enough.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.360
Alyssa.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.720
Patricia. Hi. How are you feeling?

36:07.720 --> 36:09.000
I'm fine.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.040
I really appreciate you
covering for me,

36:12.040 --> 36:14.520
but I'm back now.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.280
You don't have to be here.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.080
Oh, I know. I just wanted
to hear the announcement.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.680
I'm really proud of Noah.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.960
I know I worked for him
for only a few days, but...

36:22.960 --> 36:24.560
He's a great guy.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.000
Yep. He is.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.040
GLASS CLINKS

36:33.400 --> 36:37.880
Jackson and Ellis is a firm
built on loyalty and integrity,

36:37.880 --> 36:40.840
so when it came to choosing
a new managing partner,

36:40.840 --> 36:43.600
we went with someone
who gives tirelessly,

36:43.600 --> 36:45.480
time and time again.

36:45.480 --> 36:51.400
So, it is my great honour
to congratulate our new partner...

36:52.480 --> 36:53.840
Peter Buchanan.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.800
APPLAUSE,
HE LAUGHS

37:01.560 --> 37:04.360
WHISPERED EXCHANGE

37:04.360 --> 37:06.080
Andrew!

37:06.080 --> 37:08.600
Andrew, I respect your decision,
but I'm a little confused.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.000
If it wasn't for me, we would have
lost our biggest client

37:11.000 --> 37:13.680
to another firm.
You left Carson vulnerable.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.120
Did you even bother to figure out

37:15.120 --> 37:17.720
who the biological father
of his adopted son was?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.560
What does that even matter, sir?

37:19.560 --> 37:23.400
It was his partner.
Carson's wife had an affair.

37:27.240 --> 37:31.000
So you did know.
His son told me.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.720
And what if this son
has a change of heart

37:32.720 --> 37:35.640
and hands the company over
to his biological father?

37:35.640 --> 37:39.360
Carson is aware of the risks.
There shouldn't be any risk.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.360
Peter made sure of that
when he revised the contract.

37:42.360 --> 37:46.360
We have to protect
our clients, Noah.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.040
Even from themselves.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.520
I knew I should have
come back sooner.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.400
How the hell did Peter know
about the paternity?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.840
I saw Peter at the hospital
when you were in there.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.840
What? You're not suggesting
that I somehow told him?

38:02.840 --> 38:04.920
Noah...
Patricia, I know you would never.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.920
I wasn't accusing you.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.480
I just meant it was weird
he was there so late.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.120
But I never saw him.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.560
That's because he wasn't visiting.
Excuse me.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.280
Yeah. We'll celebrate this weekend.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.480
Yeah.

38:24.520 --> 38:28.440
I need to call you back.
How'd you know about the affair?

38:29.840 --> 38:32.160
Carson's maid drives a hard bargain.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.840
But you had to be sure. So you stole
his son's medical records.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.760
I protected this firm. You didn't.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.440
By putting Patricia in the hospital
so you had a reason to be there?

38:40.440 --> 38:43.040
Now you're just reaching.
It's done, Noah.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.000
Andrew made his choice.
Deal with it.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.760
DIAL TONE

38:46.760 --> 38:48.240
Yeah. Sorry, hun.

38:48.240 --> 38:51.720
I know. I know.
It's exciting, isn't it?

38:53.640 --> 38:55.840
Peter couldn't have gotten
the records alone.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.720
He was working with someone
at the hospital.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.400
Even if he was, we can't prove it.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.560
He's right. It's done.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.480
Oh. I wasn't expecting you.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.200
I didn't get the promotion.
What? Oh, no. I'm sorry.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I can't stay at that firm, Liz.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.880
Not after this.
I'll set up my own.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.520
Honey, I know you're upset,

39:30.520 --> 39:33.440
but it's not worth throwing away
your entire career.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.800
You've worked too hard.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.960
Why can't you just be on my side?

39:36.960 --> 39:39.240
I am on your side.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.440
Look, starting a business
isn't that simple.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.520
I submitted a proposal to the bank
for my bakery

39:45.520 --> 39:46.800
and they rejected it.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.240
If it wasn't for Sam...
Sam?

39:49.240 --> 39:50.840
Yeah.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.600
He offered to advance me the money.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.680
Why would he do that, Liz?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.040
Because we're friends.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.440
You weren't expecting me?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.600
I guess you're cooking for him now?

40:03.600 --> 40:06.320
I wanted to thank him.
Are you sleeping with him?

40:06.320 --> 40:07.560
SHE SCOFFS

40:09.840 --> 40:11.040
That's what you think?

40:11.040 --> 40:14.440
SHE STUTTERS
That I'm cheating on you?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.240
Get out.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.640
All righty, Mr Davis.
You're all checked-in

40:31.640 --> 40:33.480
for one night
in our presidential suite.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.480
I'll go ahead
and call my bellman for your bags.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.200
I don't have any bags.
Where's the bar?

40:38.200 --> 40:40.960
It's gonna be right over there. Thanks.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.000
What are you drinking?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.520
How'd you find me?

41:08.800 --> 41:13.320
Figured you'd avoid going home
and take my offer up on the hotel.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.320
I was wrong when I told you
not to fight dirty.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.600
I could never do what he did.

41:24.600 --> 41:28.600
Of course not. You're a good guy.
You're perfect.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.160
If the firm can't see that,
they don't deserve you.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.000
What he did... If it got out...

41:36.320 --> 41:37.480
...it could ruin the firm.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.280
I made that place what it is.
It's my legacy.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.320
How can I just turn a blind eye?

41:51.520 --> 41:52.560
What's that?

41:54.080 --> 41:56.920
Security footage from the hospital.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.880
What?
I was right.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.960
Peter bribed one of the doctors.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.600
How did you get... Look...

42:02.600 --> 42:04.280
It's better if you don't know.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.640
That's the only copy.
I deleted the original.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.960
Alyssa, you...
You shouldn't have done that.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.720
How else do you expect to start
your own firm?

42:15.720 --> 42:17.920
It's not like your boss
would let you keep your clients

42:17.920 --> 42:19.360
without any leverage.

42:19.360 --> 42:24.720
No. Liz is right. I'd be throwing
everything away if I left.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.080
So then stay.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.000
And take back your promotion.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.200
You deserve to be happy.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.760
Morning.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.160
Noah, it's OK.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.360
No. I shouldn't have done this.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.560
It's what you needed.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.800
To feel valued, wanted...

43:23.160 --> 43:24.400
No, Alyssa, I...

43:27.320 --> 43:30.800
I can't do this.
You don't need to say anything.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.640
I know what this was.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.160
You really are the perfect guy.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.040
PHONE CHIMES

44:04.160 --> 44:07.920
'Noah, I didn't want
to do this over the phone.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
'I'm not having an affair.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.320
'Please come home
so we can talk about it.'

44:18.600 --> 44:20.800
Good morning.
What are you doing home?

44:20.800 --> 44:23.760
I just had brunch with my mom.
Just grabbing my books.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.960
Oh. How is she?

44:25.960 --> 44:28.880
Fine. Somebody's in a good mood.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.560
As a matter of fact, I am.

44:31.560 --> 44:35.360
You didn't come home last night.
You're wearing yesterday's clothes.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.000
Did you hook up with Craig?

44:37.000 --> 44:40.320
Sorry, I'm staying out of it.
I'm staying out of it. But, did you?

44:41.480 --> 44:44.600
Guilty.
SHE GIGGLES

44:44.600 --> 44:46.480
Details.
OK.

44:46.480 --> 44:49.640
He was amazing. Perfect. Really.

44:49.640 --> 44:52.720
I'm so happy for you guys.
We should get drinks.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.200
It's not even lunch time.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.640
Tonight. Is Craig working?

44:56.640 --> 44:59.480
I'm not sure. I can ask him.
I can text him.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.880
Christina, I can manage my own life. Thanks.

45:02.880 --> 45:06.560
I mean, I'm heading to the hospital
anyway, so I'll ask him, OK?

45:17.280 --> 45:18.440
Alyssa!

45:39.200 --> 45:41.720
ENGINE STARTS UP

45:49.400 --> 45:52.360
Scotch. Neat.

45:54.480 --> 45:57.960
So...
You waiting for someone?

45:59.000 --> 46:00.080
Are you?

46:03.120 --> 46:06.200
My wife and I have an understanding.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.680
Does she know that?

46:08.680 --> 46:11.200
HE CHUCKLES

46:12.720 --> 46:14.920
Wine.
Wine not!

46:14.920 --> 46:16.160
She's not answering my texts.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.080
Craig,
she said she'd be here, right?

46:19.080 --> 46:21.560
Yeah.
Well, then stop worrying.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.360
She lives here. She'll be here.

46:25.880 --> 46:30.480
Now that Patricia's back,
you can be my secretary.

46:30.480 --> 46:33.600
Mm. Administrative assistant.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.840
Whatever.

46:35.840 --> 46:39.360
So, do you feel guilty,
stealing that promotion?

46:40.680 --> 46:44.240
I didn't steal anything.
It's just business.

46:44.240 --> 46:47.480
Got to play to win.
Like chess.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.680
He takes your knight.
You take his bishop.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.920
Something like that.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.400
You're cute.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.760
Then all is fair.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.480
You wanna get out of here?

47:03.640 --> 47:04.640
Maybe.

47:07.080 --> 47:10.720
What do I have to do
to make that a yes?

47:12.720 --> 47:14.600
Can I borrow your phone?

47:14.600 --> 47:17.520
Mine's dead,
and I should let my roommate know

47:17.520 --> 47:19.800
I probably won't be home tonight.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.240
Barkeep.
HE CLEARS THROAT

47:28.240 --> 47:30.000
Close it out.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.160
You wanna ride with me?

47:38.560 --> 47:39.720
I have my own car.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.480
All you have to do is follow me.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.280
Sorry I'm late.
I had this thing for work.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.080
Wow. You look... Incredible.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.840
Thanks. I need a drink.

49:01.840 --> 49:04.400
We finished the wine.
No, there's more in the kitchen.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.160
I'll get it.
No. I got it.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.440
I'm gonna marry that girl.
That's just the sex talking.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.920
I can't believe you guys
already hooked up.

49:13.920 --> 49:16.240
So racy.
She told you?

49:16.240 --> 49:18.920
She couldn't stop smiling
this morning.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.160
She really likes you.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.560
Yeah, she practically
ripped my clothes off.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.840
We're gonna make
beautiful babies together.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.120
I like a woman
that can plan my future.

49:44.920 --> 49:48.960
Andrew. Glad you stopped by.
We need to talk.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.160
Peter was in a car accident
last night.

49:52.560 --> 49:55.720
What? Is he OK?

49:55.720 --> 49:58.480
Funeral arrangements are being made.

49:59.800 --> 50:01.000
What the hell happened?

50:02.520 --> 50:05.000
His blood alcohol level
was over the limit,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.080
and, apparently, there was something
he couldn't live with.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.600
You mean, he killed himself?

50:10.600 --> 50:13.040
I don't know, he, uh...

50:13.040 --> 50:16.880
He texted me, er, saying his
conscience got the better of him

50:16.880 --> 50:19.640
and that he didn't want
the promotion

50:19.640 --> 50:21.120
if it was based on a lie.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.960
That doesn't sound like him.
I think he got spooked by someone.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.880
I just received this by courier.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.960
It's footage of Peter sneaking out
of the hospital.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.760
Now, on its own, it's nothing,

50:36.760 --> 50:39.440
but if the doctor he paid
to get those medical records

50:39.440 --> 50:40.480
comes forward...

50:40.480 --> 50:42.920
The firm could be held culpable.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.520
Noah, uh, we need you.

50:47.560 --> 50:51.040
You think this is how
I wanted the promotion? By default?

50:51.040 --> 50:53.000

51:24.800 --> 51:27.520
Have you been working out?
As a matter of fact, I have.

51:30.440 --> 51:33.320
Why didn't you call me back?
I'm sorry.

How much time?

51:48.840 --> 51:50.960
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

51:50.960 --> 51:54.320
Can we do dinner tonight?
Christina said you cook now.

There's a cute breakfast stop
that's nearby.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.200
I thought you said
there was one copy.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.520
What?

52:32.520 --> 52:34.400
USB drive, Alyssa.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.800
You sent another copy to Andrew

52:35.800 --> 52:37.360
when I told you
I didn't wanna use it.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.520
Then tell him what I did.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.400
You can't, can you?
Because you know I'm right.

52:43.720 --> 52:46.880
Are there any more?
No, I swear.

52:46.880 --> 52:51.080
Is what I did so bad?
You can have whatever you want now.

52:51.080 --> 52:54.720
I told Andrew I would handle it.
Who was working with Peter?

52:54.720 --> 52:56.680
Don't worry. I took care of it.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.640
My mom and I have run
so many miles here.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.640
Go easy on me. I didn't grow up
running marathons.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.520
Race you to the stairs. Go!
Wait, what?

53:04.920 --> 53:08.840
Oh, please don't hate me.

No, don't touch me.

Could you please weigh in on...

53:44.240 --> 53:46.840
OK. OK. Enough.

53:46.840 --> 53:50.120
You're defending her?
HE SIGHS

53:50.120 --> 53:52.320
Come on, come on, come on.
Who are you?

53:52.320 --> 53:53.520
Christina!

53:58.760 --> 54:00.600
You should probably
stay here tonight.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.160
SHE WINCES

54:03.160 --> 54:05.840
I'm sorry.
Don't.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.680
It's not your fault.
HE SIGHS

54:09.160 --> 54:10.920
I'll get you a room here, OK?

54:12.400 --> 54:14.320
I can just stay with you.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.440
That's not happening.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.040
You're just worried
your wife will find out.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.720
Noah, she probably already knows.
HE SIGHS

54:23.720 --> 54:26.320
I don't want to hurt her
any more than I already have.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.080
But you have to.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.320
It's the only way
we can be together.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.360
We could get a place of our own.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.760
We barely know each other.
But we love each other.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.400
HE EXHALES
I love my wife.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.880
Babe, what are we doing?
Looking for answers.

54:53.880 --> 54:56.360
Look. I know you're upset,
but we shouldn't be in here.

54:56.360 --> 54:59.240
I have to figure out who she is.
By invading her privacy?

54:59.240 --> 55:01.480
She seduced my father.

55:01.480 --> 55:05.320
And that's not the first time
she's gone after a married man.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.520
Wait. What?

55:08.120 --> 55:10.560
Who's this?
Her ex.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.120
If I can figure out who he is,
maybe he can tell me more about her.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.720
Looks like he's my dad's age.
I guess she does have a type.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.480
He knew I moved here
to get away from Jason.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.280
Did you tell him that Jason
was married, too?

55:22.280 --> 55:24.280
And I know his name.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.800
Christina, what are you doing?

55:32.800 --> 55:35.680
Searching doctors named Jason
in Texas.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.080
It's a needle in a haystack.

55:39.640 --> 55:42.360
I know.
There's thousands of them.

55:42.360 --> 55:44.800
KNOCK ON DOOR
Christina?

55:46.400 --> 55:49.080
I don't wanna talk to him.
Just give him a chance.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.640
KNOCK ON DOOR
Honey, please.

55:54.760 --> 55:57.240
DOOR OPENS

56:07.080 --> 56:08.760
How long?
Not long.

56:09.960 --> 56:13.800
Are you... in love with her?

56:13.800 --> 56:15.760
It's not about love.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.920
Alyssa's... It's different.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.720
And I know I've no right
to ask you this...

56:19.720 --> 56:21.640
I'm not gonna lie to Mom for you.

56:21.640 --> 56:26.240
No. No, I don't want you to.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.680
Just... give me time
to tell her myself.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.760
Are you getting a divorce?

56:35.720 --> 56:37.520
Sweetheart,
you've never been married.

56:37.520 --> 56:39.560
What is that supposed to mean?

56:39.560 --> 56:42.120
You don't understand the sacrifices
that you have to make.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.960
I'm sorry we made your life
so miserable.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.120
Honey...

56:46.400 --> 56:48.160
I love you.

56:48.160 --> 56:52.000
And I love your mother, but we were
so young when we had you.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.960
Younger than you are now.

56:53.960 --> 56:55.760
Get out.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.880
Christina.
I said get out.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.800
ENGINE STARTS UP

57:47.720 --> 57:49.880
Looks like you're baking
for a small army here.

57:51.400 --> 57:56.320
Yeah. I had six orders come in
last minute. Back-to-back.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.280
You need some help?

57:58.280 --> 58:00.400
Sure. Stir that.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.800
OK.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.480
You know,
I heard the news about Peter.

58:07.640 --> 58:11.720
It was just awful.
Yeah. Can't believe he's gone.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.920
I was thinking, tomorrow, I could
bring some food over to his wife.

58:18.360 --> 58:20.880
Yeah.
I'm sure she'd appreciate that.

58:22.120 --> 58:24.240
I can't imagine what
she's going through right now.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.320
Noah, if that had been you...

58:30.720 --> 58:31.840
What's wrong?

58:33.960 --> 58:37.640
Nothing. I'm just glad to be home.

58:49.720 --> 58:51.480
Here you go.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.840
Wow. You really can cook.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.520
You don't remember?

58:56.520 --> 58:58.520
When Christina was born,
you were so overwhelmed

58:58.520 --> 59:00.160
that I literally had
to learn to cook.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.600
I remember never sleeping.

59:02.600 --> 59:05.040
Kind of like right now,
with the business taking off.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.960
I bet you're loving
every minute of it.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.600
Just like when Christina was born.

59:09.600 --> 59:13.000
Honestly, it's a dream come true.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.520
And I should have considered that
before shooting down yours.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.800
Whatever you wanna do,
I believe in you.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.560
Um, so, I talked to Andrew.

59:27.560 --> 59:30.120
I told him I could start
my own firm.

59:31.200 --> 59:34.000
But he agreed that
I'd already built one.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.360
He's giving you the promotion.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.400
Yeah.
SHE CHUCKLES

59:39.400 --> 59:41.160
Name on the door, everything.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.840
No more 80-hour work weeks.
Really?

59:43.840 --> 59:45.920
Really.
Honey!

59:45.920 --> 59:47.920
CRASHING

59:47.920 --> 59:50.920
I'll go check it out. OK.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.680
Yeah. Just a little bit
of whipped cream for me.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.320
There you go.
SHE CHUCKLES

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.880
Your pecan pie is divine.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.880
You want another slice?

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.240
You can never make too much of them.
More coffee?

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.720
Nah, it's getting late.
I should probably go.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.400
Oh. You're going back?

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.160
Yeah.
Why?

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.400
I think we should take it slow.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.160
But... I'll come back tomorrow
and cook for you. OK?

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.040
OK. But, Noah, I... Tomorrow.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.200
I love you.
I love you, too.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.280
SHE EXHALES

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.280
PHONE CHIMES

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.680
Alyssa? Stop!

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.640
I saw you with her.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.600
What the hell
is the matter with you?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.200
I saw you with your wife.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You followed me?
Are you going back to her?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.480
You don't have the right to ask me
anything about my wife.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.640
She doesn't care about you.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.520
Not like I do.
No. You should go.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.360
So, that's it?
You got what you wanted.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.440
And now you're just going to go back
to a job you hate and a wife...

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.760
Don't say another word.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.040
Your marriage is over, Noah.
No, Alyssa. This is.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.920
She has a right to know.
Are you threatening me?

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.280
Let go of me!

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.880
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.480
You're a liar.
And Liz has a right to know.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.960
Ow!
Don't touch me.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.800
Mom?

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.920
Oh, sweetie.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.320
Thank you for coming by so late.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.800
Listen.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.200
I wanted to let you know,
I saw your father today.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.440
Are you OK?

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.000
That's a stupid question. I'm sorry.
How could you be.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.520
No, I'm fine. It was nice.
What?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.920
Yeah. He made dinner.
It was pretty good, too.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.760
And did you talk about anything?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.920
We talked about lots of things.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.400
We both know
we've made some mistakes.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.680
But I think we're ready
to move forward now.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.680
That's all?
Oh, and he kissed me.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.000
Listen to me,
I sound like a schoolgirl.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.360
Sweetie, I thought you'd be happy.
I am happy.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.240
Honey, as a future attorney,

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.160
you're gonna need
a better poker face.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.960
Mom, I don't know how to say this.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.480
Just say it.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.520
Liz.
Noah, what are you doing here?

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.480
You're bleeding. What happened?

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.480
You told her?
I didn't say anything.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.040
What's going on?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.760
One of you please say something.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.760
Christina, I think you should leave.
I'm staying here for Mom.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.400
What is going on?

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.120
Dad...

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.320
I slept with someone.
What?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.120
Who?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.640
Alyssa.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.120
Your roommate?

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.840
She was helping me to start training
to run again, with you.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.480
And then Patricia got sick,

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.240
and she started helping out
around the office and...

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.840
The rest just happened.
It was just one time.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.320
You knew?
Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.680
Liz, it's not her fault.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.200
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.520
Liz, please. I love you.
SHE SCOFFS

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.960
I can't live without you, Liz.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.160
Please... I'm sorry.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.720
Did she do that to your neck?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.960
Were you with her
before you came here?

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.760
I can't even look at you.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.280
I told Alyssa it's over.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.760
So, she didn't take it well?
No.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.760
You must hate me.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.280
I don't hate you.
You're my father.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.880
But you can't even look at me.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.760
I see you as a person who's flawed.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.600
I was always your hero.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160
I know.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.160
What are you going to do about Mom?

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.320
I know I have no right
to ask her for a second chance,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.720
but I won't stop trying.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.120
I can't.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.320
You better go.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.920
Yeah. OK.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.120
HE GROANS

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.040
I love you.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.280
Alyssa!

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.280
'Texas Memorial. Bingo.'

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.040
She moved out.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.800
So they're staying together
at the hotel, I guess.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.640
He says he broke it off.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.600
Does he love her?
Mom...

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.520
They just met.
It was only one night.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.720
It's not love.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.440
None of this
would ever have happened

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.200
if I didn't get an apartment.
Please don't blame yourself.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.440
He made his choice.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.600
He made a mistake.
Don't do that.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.360
Don't take his side.
I won't.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.480
Not after the way he hurt you,
but I know he still loves you.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.840
Even if you never forgive him.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.440
I'm sorry. I have to go. Mom...

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.600
FOOTSTEPS RECEDING

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.640
SHE GRUNTS

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.240
Mom? Mom!

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.479
Mom! Mom!

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:26.240
Help! Somebody help us!

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.240
Help!

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.800
SIREN WAILS

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040
Where's Liz?

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.120
She's in surgery now.
There's nothing you can do but wait.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.279
I was in court.
I got here as quick as I could.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.399
Do they know who did this?

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:55.279
Police think it was a robbery.
Her purse was stolen.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:57.920
OK. Were there any witnesses?
No.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.240
Do you know anyone
who'd want to harm Liz?

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.120
No.
Are you sure?

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.319
I said no. Where's Christina?

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:11.479
I sent her home to change.
She was covered in Liz's blood.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.200
Now you're telling my daughter
what to do?

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.359
Noah, this is not the time
or the place.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.880
Your wife could die.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.200
MY wife. Exactly.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.520
Is it done?
Yeah.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.359
We had a deal, right?
Depends.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.000
On what?
If she's dead.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:50.960
No. You told me, if I stabbed her,
you would delete the footage.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.800
You know what our deal was.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.960
You're the one
who made a deal, Craig.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.960
You sold private medical information
to that scumbag lawyer, Peter.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.360
Because of you, Noah didn't get
the promotion he deserved.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.440
You caused my family
a lot of trouble.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.600
What?

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.880
Your family? What are you talking...
Shut up!

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.800
God, you're so annoying.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.520
Who found the security footage
before the cops?

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.000
So you're not gonna
delete the footage?

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.280
You know what? You're insane.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.800
You know that?
You started this, Craig.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.040
Not me.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.760
Well, guess what, Alyssa.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.720
The wound wasn't fatal.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.160
I'm a doctor.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.400
Not a killer.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.320
But don't worry.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.040
I planted the knife in your car.
So you can rot in hell.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.640
What are you doing here?

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.360
You're my wife.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.800
I'm gonna get you some water.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.600
I heard about Liz. Is she OK?
I was...

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.080
You did this, didn't you?

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.800
I would never do something
like that.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.000
Besides, I couldn't have.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.280
I was at the obstetrician.
What are you talking about?

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.400
You're gonna be a father again, Noah.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.520
I know.
I couldn't believe it either.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.600
It was only a few days.
No. No.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.920
You're lying, and you need to leave. Now.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.600
But I wanna be here for you.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.080
I know you have to take care of Liz,
and that's OK. I'm here to help.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.520
You are insane if you think
there's a future, Alyssa.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.120
We do, Noah.
We're having a baby.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.720
That is impossible. It was one time,
and it was a few days ago.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.000
And you know that.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.200
I thought so, too,
but then I took a blood test,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200
and it turns out that...

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.360
Stop.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.320
Ignoring this won't make it go away.
You have a responsibility.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.600
The only responsibility I have
is to my wife.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.400
You can't abandon your baby.
We're a family now, Noah.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.440
All of us!
Liz.

That photo you sent me.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.200
Was it recent?
Yes, it was.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.280
All right. You need to contact
Detective Deckard immediately.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.440
Your lives are in danger.
Her name is Victoria Daniels.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.840
She killed my wife.
What?

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.080
I'm gonna give you
Detective Deckard's direct line.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.120
Let me see if I can find his card.
Oh, my God.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.320
I regret they day I ever met her.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.080
When I broke it off,
she couldn't handle it.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.680
Kept going on and on about
how we were perfect for each other.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.360
And then, Victoria vanished.
Nobody could find her.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.560
Not until now.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.640
I've seen her driver's license,
it says Alyssa Winters.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.520
Victoria was smart.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.880
She would have changed her identity
or stolen it from someone.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.040
Wait. I think I remember an article
about a missing woman in Texas.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.000
'I'm gonna send you a photo
of Detective Deckard's card.'

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.720
You have to call him immediately.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.800
Victoria will destroy your entire
family to get what she wants,

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.200
just like she destroyed mine.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.760
Thanks.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.640
Got to take your pain meds.
Leave them on the table and go.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.600
Liz, can we talk, please?

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.520
You wanna talk?

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.840
Why don't you tell me
how you could sleep with a girl

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.560
who's young enough
to be your daughter?

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.520
I was at a low point.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.240
I was watching you and Sam
get closer,

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.400
while we were drifting
further apart.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.720
And ever since Christina was born...

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.240
Don't you dare
bring Christina into this.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.640
Please.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.400
I have nothing but love
for Christina.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.520
And you, too,
with your competitive nature

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.160
and the way you talk to each other
in your own shorthand.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.040
It's a bond I've seen grow
since she was born.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.200
So, then, what?

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.160
It's you.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.560
And me.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.520
I just...
I felt so disconnected from you.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.160
Since she was born.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.480
Wow. That long?
It's not always.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.600
But sometimes.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.920
And I made...

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.080
...a really big mistake.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.840
And I got drunk,
and I wasn't thinking.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.520
And by no means
is that an excuse...

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.320
...but it was just the one night,
and I would do anything...

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.720
if I could take it all back.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.880
I am so angry.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.760
All I wanna do is hate you.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.360
I can't.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.520
I don't want us to be disconnected.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.120
I'm not gonna ask you to forgive me.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.960
Not until I've done...

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.800
...everything I can
to make you trust me again.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640
OK?

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.680
Will you go make me some lunch?

...but I never stood a chance.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.480

But that doesn't matter.

Who was he?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.720
His name was Craig Porter.
He was a doctor.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.840
His body was in the trunk
of Alyssa's car.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.480
We don't have all the details,

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.840
but can you think of any reason
why he would target your family?

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.360
No. Craig was our friend.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.200
He was dating Alyssa.
Wait. Did you say he was a doctor?

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.680
Yeah, I did. Why?

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.080
I think he attacked Liz
because Alyssa was blackmailing him.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.280
