00:00.092 --> 00:02.927
Previously on Elementary...
Irene Adler.

00:02.928 --> 00:04.477
Got killed
in her flat.

00:04.479 --> 00:05.478
Year and a half ago.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.180
That was Moriarty.

00:07.182 --> 00:08.798
And whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking to?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.299
MAN:
My name is Moriarty.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.352
Irene Adler--
did you have her killed?

00:12.354 --> 00:14.688
That is the question, is it not?

00:14.690 --> 00:15.905
What was she like?

00:15.907 --> 00:18.324
To me... <i>the</i> woman.

00:18.326 --> 00:20.243
To me, she eclipsed
and predominated

00:20.245 --> 00:21.528
the whole of her gender.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.079
What do you think's
inside?

00:23.081 --> 00:25.699
HOLMES: <i>The reasons I'm here</i>
<i>are personal.</i>

00:25.701 --> 00:27.650
Irene?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.986
Irene.

00:31.922 --> 00:35.175
Irene. Oh, Irene. Irene.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.176
(whimpering)

00:36.178 --> 00:38.378
Irene!

00:41.382 --> 00:43.550
(gasps softly)

00:46.721 --> 00:48.688
(grunts)

00:48.690 --> 00:50.907
(panting)

00:57.982 --> 01:01.234
(knocking on door)
WOMAN: <i>Door's open.</i>

01:06.407 --> 01:08.908
Hi. You must
be the P.I.

01:08.910 --> 01:11.461
Consulting detective, yes.

01:11.463 --> 01:13.630
Sherlock Holmes.

01:13.632 --> 01:16.049
Consulting detective?

01:16.051 --> 01:18.968
Is that different
from a P.I.?

01:18.970 --> 01:22.255
There's considerably less
clandestine photography

01:22.257 --> 01:24.591
of cheating spouses, yeah.

01:24.593 --> 01:26.760
Uh, as I mentioned
in my e-mail,

01:26.762 --> 01:29.145
I'm looking into a matter
for a friend of mine

01:29.147 --> 01:31.514
who procures items for
auction at Christie's.

01:31.516 --> 01:33.549
Now, Mr. Kirby of
the British Museum

01:33.551 --> 01:35.418
said that as
his top restorer,

01:35.420 --> 01:37.487
you were the
person to see.

01:37.489 --> 01:41.390
Nice of Mr. Kirby.

01:43.194 --> 01:45.829
Irene Adler. Nice to meet...

01:45.831 --> 01:47.563
Oh.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.415
You're beautiful.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.901
Symmetry-- I'm...

01:51.903 --> 01:54.570
trained to be
on the lookout for it.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.072
Hmm.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.174
Anyway, I looked
at those pictures you e-mailed.

01:58.176 --> 02:00.794
Tell your friend at
Christie's that, I'm sorry,

02:00.796 --> 02:04.047
but those canvasses
aren't original Turners.

02:04.049 --> 02:05.298
You're certain?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.350
The provenance
is quite convincing.

02:07.352 --> 02:10.854
Yeah. They're good forgeries
but, you know,

02:10.856 --> 02:13.223
they're forgeries.
They're supposed to be

02:13.225 --> 02:15.024
the studies
for <i>The Fighting Temeraire,</i>

02:15.026 --> 02:18.611
but they have a... a medium
orange and ochre in them.

02:18.613 --> 02:21.564
In 1839, you needed
turmeric to make

02:21.566 --> 02:22.899
ochre paint.

02:22.901 --> 02:25.702
But 1839 was also
the beginning of your

02:25.704 --> 02:27.603
Afghan war; the army

02:27.605 --> 02:31.074
commandeered turmeric for
a preservative in rations.

02:31.076 --> 02:35.078
That's why you don't see ochre
in <i>The Fighting Temeraire.</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:37.463
Or any painting
from back then.

02:37.465 --> 02:39.082
Hmm.

02:39.084 --> 02:42.785
I'm surprised
I hadn't realized that. Yet.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.787
Shame, really.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.173
The world would be
a more interesting place

02:47.175 --> 02:50.143
with a few new
Turners in it.

02:51.762 --> 02:55.315
So these are all your...
work, are they?

02:55.317 --> 02:58.151
Mm-hmm.

02:58.153 --> 02:59.819
Hmm.

02:59.821 --> 03:02.488
You're very gifted.

03:02.490 --> 03:05.024
Do you do original work?

03:05.026 --> 03:09.879
What could I add to all this?
What could anyone?

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.544 --> 03:26.429
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to linger, I just...

03:28.599 --> 03:31.551
It's just... if these were all
supposed to be reproductions,

03:31.553 --> 03:34.220
what is the original
of Brueghel's <i>The Blind</i>

03:34.222 --> 03:35.722
Leading the Blind
doing on your wall?

03:35.724 --> 03:37.140
I wonder what

03:37.142 --> 03:38.725
the director of the
Belgian National Museum

03:38.727 --> 03:41.010
would have to say if he knew
that you had returned

03:41.012 --> 03:45.398
your work to him and passed
it off as the real thing.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.183
How could you possibly
know that?

03:47.185 --> 03:50.236
The original was damaged
by shelling

03:50.238 --> 03:52.038
during the Great War.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.325
Hard to see why you,
a restorer by trade,

03:55.327 --> 03:58.694
would recreate the gouges
in the canvas.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.714
I'm curious-- you don't
intend to sell it,

04:01.716 --> 04:04.367
so why take the risk?

04:08.038 --> 04:11.507
The museum director wanted
to file down the paint

04:11.509 --> 04:13.676
where the gouges were.

04:13.678 --> 04:15.895
I told him
that that would compromise

04:15.897 --> 04:18.880
what the artist intended,
but he didn't see it my way,

04:18.882 --> 04:20.516
so I...

04:20.517 --> 04:22.718
preserved it.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.687
I see.

04:24.689 --> 04:27.723
And some of these
other paintings are...

04:27.725 --> 04:29.158
preserved as well,

04:29.160 --> 04:30.910
are they?

04:30.912 --> 04:32.946
Hmm.

04:32.948 --> 04:35.698
A bargain then.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.835
I'll tell you which of the
paintings are reproductions

04:38.837 --> 04:43.256
and which of them are counts
of felonious theft.

04:44.241 --> 04:46.876
And if I deduce correctly,

04:46.878 --> 04:50.763
you'll spend an evening
in this great city with me.

04:50.765 --> 04:52.915
You're not going to turn me in?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.968
I appreciate your efforts
to keep the vulgarities

04:54.970 --> 04:56.552
of the modern
era at bay.

04:56.554 --> 04:58.688
Whether you agree
to my game or not,

04:58.690 --> 05:01.474
I'll leave you to your work.

05:01.476 --> 05:05.594
I assure you, we would enjoy
each other's company.

05:05.596 --> 05:09.565
I have no wish
to coerce your attentions.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.150
You're not boring at all,
are you?

05:11.152 --> 05:13.953
I make every effort not to be.

05:15.489 --> 05:19.442
I accept, but I do
have one question.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.462
I've already told you
that you're beautiful,

05:22.464 --> 05:25.465
and I can see the way
you're looking at me.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.800
Why would we need
to leave this apartment

05:27.802 --> 05:29.802
to enjoy each other's company?

05:33.790 --> 05:37.343
A game with proper stakes then.

05:38.429 --> 05:40.629
Shall we?

05:47.304 --> 05:50.356
(sighs)
Hmm.

05:50.358 --> 05:53.976
DOCTOR: Ms. Adler, I understand
you're disoriented,

05:53.978 --> 05:56.396
but it really is 2013.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.315
No. Mr. Stapleton told me

05:59.317 --> 06:01.451
it was my birthday
seven different times.

06:01.453 --> 06:03.369
He was lying.

06:04.638 --> 06:08.424
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Stone, 2945.

06:08.426 --> 06:13.046
Dr. Stone, 2945.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.688
I'm here, if you want to talk.

06:25.559 --> 06:29.162
I can't even imagine what you
must be thinking right now.

06:32.682 --> 06:34.350
Hey.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.818
Hey.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.370
What did you find
at the house?

06:37.372 --> 06:41.074
Not much of anything yet.
CSU's there with Bell.

06:41.909 --> 06:44.544
Is that her?
That's Irene?

06:44.546 --> 06:46.546
(door opens)

06:47.965 --> 06:50.550
I, uh...

06:52.219 --> 06:55.704
Your friend is fine.
Physically.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.590
But if I had to put
a name on it, I would say

06:57.592 --> 07:00.593
that she's suffering from
severe post-traumatic stress.

07:00.595 --> 07:02.011
What happened to her?

07:02.013 --> 07:03.712
She doesn't remember
everything clearly,

07:03.714 --> 07:07.550
but she was abducted,
moved from place to place.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.886
There were five
that she told me about.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.333
And then she was subjected

07:11.358 --> 07:13.503
to advanced psychological
pressure tactics.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.243
Seems that somebody had set out
to systematically destroy

07:17.245 --> 07:18.828
this young woman's personality,

07:18.830 --> 07:23.166
and, for the life of me,
I cannot give you a reason why.

07:23.168 --> 07:25.618
Did she talk about the people
who took her?

07:25.620 --> 07:28.121
She dealt
with only one person.

07:28.123 --> 07:30.940
He named himself
Mr. Stapleton.

07:30.942 --> 07:34.110
By day, he tinkered
with her mind,

07:34.112 --> 07:37.647
left white peonies
by her bed at night.

07:37.649 --> 07:40.850
Punishment, reward--
all designed

07:40.852 --> 07:43.252
to make Ms. Adler
psychologically dependent

07:43.254 --> 07:45.054
on her captor.

07:45.056 --> 07:47.440
Did you get a description
of Mr. Stapleton?

07:47.442 --> 07:49.559
She said he was white,
about five-ten,

07:49.561 --> 07:51.144
but as far as what
he looked like,

07:51.146 --> 07:54.447
she drew this.

07:54.449 --> 07:56.932
He was wearing it every time
she spoke to him.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.768
I've given her a sedative,

07:59.770 --> 08:02.771
and we're gonna keep her
on a psych hold for a few days.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.956
WATSON:
Thank you, Doctor.

08:06.627 --> 08:08.628
(sighs)

08:08.630 --> 08:13.833
It's odd to hear that man wonder
why this happened to Irene.

08:17.087 --> 08:19.472
It was because of me.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.626
Moriarty...

08:23.628 --> 08:26.846
wanted me to believe
that she was dead,

08:26.848 --> 08:29.482
let me mourn her,

08:29.484 --> 08:32.434
get addicted to heroin.

08:32.437 --> 08:34.820
And then when I made steps
towards recovery,

08:34.822 --> 08:38.191
he sends her back to me.

08:38.193 --> 08:41.577
Well... part of her.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.165
Yeah, where'd
all her blood come from?

08:46.167 --> 08:47.867
(clicks tongue)

08:49.786 --> 08:53.689
How did I not know
that she was alive?

08:53.691 --> 08:57.326
What-what did I miss?

08:58.128 --> 09:01.380
Can you give us
a minute?

09:01.382 --> 09:04.383
Oh, yeah. Sure.

09:04.385 --> 09:07.603
(man speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

09:10.006 --> 09:12.174
(Holmes sighs)

09:15.562 --> 09:18.614
Irene has been
hurt badly,

09:18.616 --> 09:22.652
but she's alive and
she can get better.

09:22.654 --> 09:25.871
You can help her.
Yes, of course.

09:25.873 --> 09:28.291
Whatever she needs.

09:28.293 --> 09:30.693
We've got clues.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.696
We can go and find that man.
We can go back to the house...

09:33.698 --> 09:36.882
No, uh, I shan't be
consulting on Irene's case.

09:38.669 --> 09:41.904
Do you really want
to sit this one out?

09:41.906 --> 09:44.473
I need to look after her.

09:45.325 --> 09:48.477
Besides, I don't think
I'd be much use.

09:48.479 --> 09:52.932
Moriarty is quite clearly
smarter than I am.

09:52.934 --> 09:56.986
A man should know
when he's beaten.

11:08.996 --> 11:11.164
How do you think
she's doing?

11:11.166 --> 11:14.317
She seems less disoriented
than before.

11:14.319 --> 11:16.703
She has a few questions
about this Moriarty character,

11:16.705 --> 11:18.421
but don't we all?

11:18.423 --> 11:21.341
Have you heard from her family yet?
I don't expect to.

11:21.343 --> 11:24.411
The uncle who raised her
died shortly before we met.

11:24.413 --> 11:26.796
Her brother was enjoying an
extended adolescence in Thailand

11:26.798 --> 11:28.598
the last time
we'd heard of him.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.018
Should we talk about a plan?

11:32.020 --> 11:34.054
I look after her.

11:34.056 --> 11:36.189
No. I know.
I mean... (sighs)

11:36.191 --> 11:38.174
Should we talk about
how that's gonna work?

11:38.176 --> 11:41.061
I mean, I want to help out
any way that I can.

11:41.063 --> 11:42.345
(sighs)

11:42.347 --> 11:44.680
Look, do you even
want me around?

11:44.682 --> 11:46.316
Is it too crowded in here?

11:46.318 --> 11:48.184
I-I can start looking
for my own place.

11:48.186 --> 11:51.121
Uh, no. This is your home.

11:51.123 --> 11:54.290
I-I... I don't have
any answers for you, I'm afraid.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.960
We'll have to figure this out
as we go along.

11:56.962 --> 12:00.463
I do know that
I want you to work.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.465
We've been in the hospital
for three days.

12:02.467 --> 12:05.418
And if you're going to help
find the people who took Irene,

12:05.420 --> 12:07.554
you need to get cracking.

12:07.556 --> 12:09.222
Well, I've never
consulted without you before.

12:09.224 --> 12:10.974
Well, I am confident
that Captain Gregson

12:10.976 --> 12:13.426
and Detective Bell can
handle the transition neatly.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.761
Excuse me.

12:20.101 --> 12:22.519
(sighs heavily)

12:22.521 --> 12:24.771
You lurk.

12:24.773 --> 12:26.940
I do.

12:28.058 --> 12:30.443
I'm not your sober
companion anymore.

12:31.728 --> 12:34.280
But I know a relapse trigger
when I see one.

12:34.282 --> 12:36.166
Have you talked
to Alfredo?

12:36.168 --> 12:39.869
I have no need of a sponsor to
keep me from turning to heroin.

12:39.871 --> 12:42.288
I have my duties.
Now go.

12:42.290 --> 12:46.342
My water turns hot,
your case grows cold.

12:49.964 --> 12:53.416
GREGSON: <i>Holmes really</i>
<i>isn't coming, huh?</i>

12:53.418 --> 12:55.435
No. He wants
to take care of Irene.

12:55.437 --> 12:58.254
I mean, if things were normal,
I'd say, there's no way

12:58.256 --> 13:00.590
he sits out
an entire investigation,

13:00.592 --> 13:02.525
but right now, who knows?

13:02.527 --> 13:04.944
He's really thrown by all this.

13:04.946 --> 13:07.147
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

13:07.149 --> 13:09.432
Let me ask
you something.

13:09.434 --> 13:11.601
You believe this
guy is real?

13:11.603 --> 13:13.436
Moriarty?

13:13.438 --> 13:15.104
I do.

13:15.106 --> 13:16.739
No Holmes?

13:16.741 --> 13:19.075
Well, finally
tracked down the owner.

13:19.077 --> 13:21.611
I don't think we're gonna
learn too much from him.

13:21.613 --> 13:23.496
He's nine,
and he lives in Austria.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.165
Kid's never even seen the place.

13:25.167 --> 13:28.284
He inherited it from his uncle
when he was three years old.

13:28.286 --> 13:29.636
Trust paid for a caretaker

13:29.638 --> 13:31.588
to come out
a couple times a year.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.122
The caretaker didn't
see anything, either.

13:33.124 --> 13:35.225
They must not have held
her here that long.

13:35.227 --> 13:37.977
Did you find anything
when you looked around?

13:37.979 --> 13:39.646
Well, nothing much.
That Stapleton guy

13:39.648 --> 13:41.564
had to know
you were coming.

13:41.566 --> 13:43.233
He cleaned
the place out.

13:43.235 --> 13:45.652
No one who lives in the area
saw anyone coming or going.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.070
Oh.

13:47.072 --> 13:48.471
Hmm? You got
something?

13:48.473 --> 13:49.822
Maybe nothing.

13:49.824 --> 13:52.492
Um... I have
these reading assignments.

13:52.494 --> 13:54.611
It's part of my training
with Sherlock.

13:54.613 --> 13:58.031
Lately, it's been about art--
how it's forged, stolen,

13:58.033 --> 13:59.449
sold on the black market.

13:59.451 --> 14:01.618
I just read
about this color-- gamboge.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.369
See, I usually
just go with yellow.

14:03.371 --> 14:04.987
Well, it's the kind
of yellow.

14:04.989 --> 14:06.539
See how bright
the pigment is?

14:06.541 --> 14:07.990
Gamboge comes from a resin.

14:07.992 --> 14:10.159
It's harvested in these trees.

14:10.161 --> 14:13.179
It's found in Southern Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand.

14:13.181 --> 14:14.681
It takes a long time
to harvest,

14:14.683 --> 14:16.349
so it's rare,
and so is this brand.

14:16.351 --> 14:18.101
I'm guessing there's only
a handful of places

14:18.103 --> 14:19.502
in New York that carry it.

14:19.504 --> 14:22.338
Somebody had to buy this
for Irene, right?

14:22.340 --> 14:24.607
If we figure out
where it came from,

14:24.609 --> 14:27.193
maybe we can find out
who was watching her.

14:28.679 --> 14:31.180
Feels just like having
Holmes here, doesn't it?

14:31.182 --> 14:32.949
GREGSON:
Hmm.

14:35.236 --> 14:37.853
(door creaks open)

14:40.691 --> 14:42.692
Miss Adler.

14:42.694 --> 14:44.694
Sherlock Holmes, P.I. Hi.

14:44.696 --> 14:46.329
Uh, apologies
for the ambush.

14:46.331 --> 14:48.665
I was just... I arrived
just as you were leaving.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.033
No problem. What's up?

14:51.035 --> 14:53.636
Yes, well, it's been
several weeks

14:53.638 --> 14:55.922
since our
meeting-turned-interrogation

14:55.924 --> 14:58.258
turned... sexual marathon.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.893
A memorable afternoon
and evening.

15:00.895 --> 15:03.179
I'm sure you'd agree.

15:03.181 --> 15:05.815
Yet, each time I've tried
to arrange for an encore,

15:05.817 --> 15:09.986
I've been politely,
but unmistakably rebuffed,

15:09.988 --> 15:12.655
as if your right,
of course.

15:12.657 --> 15:15.391
Although, I admit, I'm not
accustomed to rebuffings.

15:15.393 --> 15:16.659
You're not accustomed to being

15:16.661 --> 15:18.494
on the <i>receiving</i>
end of rebuffings.

15:18.496 --> 15:21.781
Quite so. It seems to me,

15:21.783 --> 15:23.950
we had an experience
worth repeating.

15:23.952 --> 15:26.402
Just... I'm curious
as to why you differ.

15:26.404 --> 15:27.870
I don't differ.

15:27.872 --> 15:30.206
I reject your whole premise.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.875
Our afternoon was one
of the most unique

15:32.877 --> 15:34.377
and memorable of my life.

15:34.379 --> 15:36.296
It can't be repeated.

15:36.298 --> 15:38.414
We could try,
but that's just a game

15:38.416 --> 15:40.516
of diminishing returns,
isn't it?

15:40.518 --> 15:43.436
I'd rather just remember it
the way it was.

15:43.438 --> 15:46.272
You preserve the integrity
of the initial encounter

15:46.274 --> 15:48.474
by denying yourself
further ones.

15:48.476 --> 15:50.193
Interesting.

15:50.195 --> 15:52.278
People don't treasure
things anymore.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.864
You should try it.

15:58.101 --> 16:00.203
You're not boring
at all, are you?

16:00.205 --> 16:02.104
I try not to be.

16:02.106 --> 16:04.040
What if I could offer you

16:04.042 --> 16:06.292
another entirely
unique experience?

16:06.294 --> 16:07.910
Surely, that would be
worth pursuing.

16:07.912 --> 16:10.112
Unique is
a high bar to clear.

16:10.114 --> 16:11.998
I'm fully aware of that.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.449
But if you're not concerned

16:13.451 --> 16:15.051
about keeping
your clothes clean,

16:15.053 --> 16:18.137
I'm quite confident
this would fit the bill.

16:20.257 --> 16:22.291
IRENE: I did not know
there were tunnels

16:22.293 --> 16:23.593
underneath Camden Market.

16:23.595 --> 16:24.977
SHERLOCK:
Yeah.

16:24.979 --> 16:26.562
Well, they're closed
to the public,

16:26.564 --> 16:28.097
'cause they've got
the unfortunate habit

16:28.099 --> 16:30.132
of flooding every
now and again.

16:30.134 --> 16:32.802
I was working on a case
where I was required

16:32.804 --> 16:35.938
to spend quite a bit of time
in London's extensive network

16:35.940 --> 16:38.491
of underground tunnels
and catacombs,

16:38.493 --> 16:40.610
so, I made my own map.

16:40.612 --> 16:45.081
Um, in doing so,
I became convinced there was

16:45.083 --> 16:46.999
a quarter mile of
undocumented tunnel,

16:47.001 --> 16:48.451
which was cut off

16:48.453 --> 16:50.319
from its ilk
by the cave-in.

16:50.321 --> 16:52.988
Now, there was just
a simple matter

16:52.990 --> 16:54.990
of some unsanctioned
work with dynamite

16:54.992 --> 16:58.010
to see if I was
right or not.

16:59.096 --> 17:01.547
Here we are.

17:01.549 --> 17:04.050
Thank you.

17:05.519 --> 17:08.221
Uh, should you
really be doing that?

17:08.223 --> 17:09.521
It's fine.

17:09.523 --> 17:11.022
I put the sign here myself.

17:11.025 --> 17:14.810
Can't have spelunkers
poking around there, can we?

17:14.813 --> 17:17.396
(water flowing,
Sherlock groans)

17:19.900 --> 17:22.518
Shall we?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.747
What is this place?

17:34.749 --> 17:37.250
It's a canal.

17:37.252 --> 17:39.752
It dates back to the...

17:39.754 --> 17:42.371
Roman occupation
of Britain.

17:46.093 --> 17:47.894
Those are prayer tablets. See?

17:47.896 --> 17:53.266
They're messages from Roman
citizens to their gods.

17:53.268 --> 17:55.718
They date back millennia.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.021
Hmm.

17:59.023 --> 18:02.325
You and I are the only
two people who know about these.

18:09.065 --> 18:11.734
IRENE:
No!

18:14.455 --> 18:16.422
No!

18:16.424 --> 18:18.574
(crying)

18:18.576 --> 18:20.343
Irene. Irene.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.244
He changed the
rules again.

18:22.246 --> 18:25.965
Mr. Stapleton-- he changed the
rules, and he didn't tell me.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.099
HOLMES (gently):
Okay.

18:27.101 --> 18:28.551
No! God, no!

18:28.553 --> 18:31.137
(panting)

18:32.439 --> 18:34.106
I'll get some water.

18:36.193 --> 18:38.594
Sherlock...

18:38.596 --> 18:40.813
Come...

18:40.815 --> 18:43.282
Come sit with me.

18:43.284 --> 18:47.119
Tell me how you've been.

18:47.121 --> 18:50.490
What was the last year
and a half of your life like?

18:52.459 --> 18:55.110
You moved to New York.

18:55.112 --> 18:58.781
There must be a story there.

18:59.950 --> 19:02.134
(door opens)
WATSON: Hey, I'm back!

19:02.136 --> 19:04.787
I should see
if she's learned anything.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.593
How is she?

19:10.595 --> 19:12.061
Uh, I don't know.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.462
Maybe a hair better.

19:13.464 --> 19:15.130
What news from the front?

19:15.132 --> 19:17.483
Well, I learned
that there is such a thing

19:17.485 --> 19:19.685
as a nine-year-old Austrian
real estate tycoon.

19:19.687 --> 19:21.187
(phone ringing)

19:21.189 --> 19:23.472
Other than that, nothing.

19:23.474 --> 19:25.140
Hi, Captain.

19:25.142 --> 19:27.076
Your gamboge tip paid off.

19:27.078 --> 19:30.813
That pigment you found came
from a specialty supply store

19:30.815 --> 19:34.166
in Tribeca called
Halcyon Paints.

19:34.168 --> 19:37.036
They sold one package of it
in the past few weeks,

19:37.038 --> 19:39.338
to a guy named Duane Proctor.

19:39.340 --> 19:40.873
Did a five-year stretch
a while back

19:40.875 --> 19:42.341
for assault
with a deadly weapon.

19:42.343 --> 19:43.793
(elevator bell dings)

19:43.795 --> 19:45.127
Do you know where he is?

19:45.129 --> 19:46.495
His PO says he's
been crashing

19:46.497 --> 19:48.014
with his brother
since he got out.

19:48.016 --> 19:50.049
We're on our way to talk
to him right now.

19:50.051 --> 19:51.834
Look, I'm sorry,
I just don't think

19:51.836 --> 19:53.803
that there's any way Duane
had anything to do with...

19:53.805 --> 19:55.021
What exactly are you
talking about?

19:55.023 --> 19:56.606
An abduction?

19:56.608 --> 19:58.641
Well, he did do a stint
in Sing Sing, yeah?

19:58.643 --> 20:01.777
Duane has made a genuine effort
to reform himself.

20:01.779 --> 20:03.145
Look, I wouldn't let him stay

20:03.147 --> 20:04.530
at the house
if I didn't believe that.

20:04.532 --> 20:07.233
I tutor kids here.
DETECTIVE: Captain,

20:07.235 --> 20:08.618
he just pulled up.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.237
Sit tight.
Muldoon, stay with him.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.659
Duane Proctor?

20:16.661 --> 20:19.245
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

20:19.247 --> 20:20.997
What's going on here?

20:20.999 --> 20:23.382
We were wondering if we could
ask you a few questions

20:23.384 --> 20:24.700
about Irene Adler.

20:24.702 --> 20:27.587
I'm supposed to
know who that is?

20:27.589 --> 20:29.204
Yeah, I kind of doubt
you kidnapped her

20:29.206 --> 20:30.706
and never asked
her name.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.675
What? What the hell are
you guys talking about?

20:32.677 --> 20:34.093
Hey, don't waste
our time, man.

20:34.095 --> 20:35.511
The paint you bought--
the yellow paint--

20:35.513 --> 20:37.096
Irene was using that
when we found her.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.681
Yellow paint?

20:38.683 --> 20:41.150
Okay, I bought some paint
and brushes and stuff,

20:41.152 --> 20:42.885
but I don't know
this Irene whoever.

20:42.887 --> 20:44.854
I bought that
stuff for Isaac.

20:44.856 --> 20:46.355
My brother.
He's a tutor.

20:46.357 --> 20:48.223
One of his kids
needed some supplies

20:48.225 --> 20:50.109
for an art project
or something...?

20:50.111 --> 20:51.410
(gunshots)

20:51.412 --> 20:53.296
Stay with him.

20:53.298 --> 20:54.697
Wait, wait, wait.

20:54.699 --> 20:56.115
Whoa, whoa.

20:56.117 --> 20:57.900
Okay, open, open.

20:57.902 --> 20:59.452
Ho!

20:59.454 --> 21:01.504
Detective!

21:01.506 --> 21:04.406
(Muldoon groaning)

21:04.408 --> 21:05.791
GREGSON:
Call it in! Call it in!

21:05.793 --> 21:08.077
Wait. No, he went out the back!

21:08.079 --> 21:10.546
GREGSON: All right,
just lay down, lay down.

21:10.548 --> 21:13.215
Tell 'em to put out
a BOLO for Isaac Proctor.

21:13.217 --> 21:16.268
We came looking
for the wrong brother.

21:22.374 --> 21:24.175
I don't know why
my brother did what he did.

21:24.890 --> 21:26.273
I didn't even know he had a gun.

21:26.275 --> 21:28.058
We found a small arsenal

21:28.060 --> 21:29.910
in that locker
in his garage.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.862
He had guns,
silencers,

21:31.864 --> 21:33.697
passports under
three different names.

21:33.699 --> 21:36.166
DUANE: And I am just as confused
about this as you are.

21:36.168 --> 21:37.951
My brother was the good one.
He was the smart one.

21:37.953 --> 21:39.286
Before he was tutoring kids,

21:39.288 --> 21:40.671
he worked in a freakin'
think tank.

21:40.673 --> 21:43.674
BELL: He ever mention a guy
named Moriarty?

21:43.676 --> 21:46.343
We went to high school
with a guy named Maury Goldberg.

21:46.345 --> 21:49.296
No. It's one name--
a last name.

21:49.298 --> 21:51.715
Moriarty.

21:51.717 --> 21:54.384
Isaac never mentioned him.

21:54.386 --> 21:57.287
If he did, I would tell you.

21:57.289 --> 21:59.422
I don't want to go back
to prison, man.

21:59.424 --> 22:01.391
IRENE: I'm sorry.
I don't know his face,

22:01.393 --> 22:03.360
and I don't know his voice.

22:03.362 --> 22:06.897
If he ever came to the house
I was in, I don't remember it.

22:06.899 --> 22:09.983
What about his brother...

22:09.985 --> 22:12.152
Isaac?

22:14.205 --> 22:16.323
I'm sorry. I-I just can't tell.

22:16.325 --> 22:18.408
WATSON:
It's okay.

22:18.410 --> 22:21.378
It's brave of you
to just come down.

22:21.380 --> 22:24.381
If that's all there is,
I think we'd best be going.

22:24.383 --> 22:25.999
Yeah, come on, hm?

22:26.001 --> 22:27.450
Okay.

22:31.339 --> 22:33.957
It's weird to see him
walk away from a case.

22:33.959 --> 22:36.476
I mean, don't-don't
get me wrong; I get it.

22:36.478 --> 22:38.011
It's just weird.

22:38.013 --> 22:41.431
Well, how's the detective
doing that got shot?

22:41.433 --> 22:43.233
Six broken ribs,

22:43.235 --> 22:44.484
punctured lung.

22:44.486 --> 22:46.770
He's lucky he was
wearing his vest.

22:46.772 --> 22:49.656
He's lucky the perp decided
to shoot him there.

22:49.658 --> 22:51.825
The weapons we found
were modified.

22:51.827 --> 22:53.160
They had suppressors.

22:53.162 --> 22:56.363
Tells me Isaac
Proctor is a pro.

22:56.365 --> 22:58.648
He could've
killed Muldoon

22:58.650 --> 23:00.283
if he chose to.

23:00.285 --> 23:03.003
So what now?
We keep digging

23:03.005 --> 23:05.288
into Isaac's background,
see if we can't connect him

23:05.290 --> 23:07.240
to Holmes's pal.

23:07.242 --> 23:09.176
In the meantime,
his picture's still out there.

23:09.178 --> 23:12.713
It's not much,
but it's where we start.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.500
(phone ringing)

23:17.502 --> 23:19.686
(turns off faucet)

23:22.673 --> 23:24.941
Ten messages
before you call me back?

23:24.943 --> 23:27.477
MAN: I had to explain
your situation to Moriarty.

23:27.479 --> 23:29.863
It took some time
to make contact.

23:29.865 --> 23:32.783
How did the police find you?
I don't have any idea.

23:32.785 --> 23:34.851
Look, my face is
all over the news--

23:34.853 --> 23:36.319
can you help me or not?

23:36.321 --> 23:37.654
Of course we can.

23:37.656 --> 23:39.522
But we need you
to run an errand.

23:39.524 --> 23:41.708
It involves Sherlock Holmes.

23:43.044 --> 23:45.528
(TV changing channels)

23:45.530 --> 23:47.881
NEWSWOMAN: ...was rocked by scandal
for the secon...

23:47.883 --> 23:49.549
NEWSMAN:
...taken to hospital but...

23:49.551 --> 23:52.285
NEWSMAN 2: ...National
Hockey League featured a busy...

23:52.287 --> 23:55.389
IRENE:
You're doing that now? Really?

23:55.391 --> 23:57.007
We've just had sex.

23:57.009 --> 23:59.726
My brain is awash
with neurochemicals.

23:59.728 --> 24:02.729
This is a particularly
vexing case.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.066
"M."
Mm.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.068
I still can't determine
the method

24:08.070 --> 24:11.021
with which he chooses
his victims.

24:11.023 --> 24:13.723
But the only consistency...

24:13.725 --> 24:16.493
is the means
by which he executes them.

24:16.495 --> 24:19.746
He hangs their bodies
from a tripod device, like this,

24:19.748 --> 24:21.031
and then...

24:21.033 --> 24:23.250
Drains their blood. I remember.
Yeah.

24:23.252 --> 24:25.735
Is this all I am now?

24:25.737 --> 24:28.071
A piece of exercise
equipment for your brain?

24:28.073 --> 24:29.840
You're the greatest piece
of exercise equipment

24:29.842 --> 24:32.292
a man could ever hope
to throw a leg over.

24:32.294 --> 24:34.845
That's Keats, right?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.131
You're right.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.684
I'm being terribly rude.

24:40.686 --> 24:42.853
Yes, but you're
typically quite rude.

24:42.855 --> 24:46.756
I'm trying to figure out
why it doesn't bother me.

24:46.758 --> 24:49.643
'Cause <i>you're</i> rude.

24:49.645 --> 24:51.594
Well, I mean, you're...

24:51.596 --> 24:52.996
you're honest.

24:52.998 --> 24:54.648
Simple minds he always

24:54.650 --> 24:58.535
confused great honesty
with great rudeness.

25:03.774 --> 25:05.659
Mmm...

25:05.661 --> 25:09.612
You know I'm not releasing
any more neurochemicals, right?

25:09.614 --> 25:11.498
You know...

25:11.500 --> 25:13.467
these... these birthmarks,

25:13.469 --> 25:17.120
they are... almost
exactly the same shape

25:17.122 --> 25:19.389
as the constellation Auriga.

25:19.391 --> 25:22.692
Is that a good
thing or bad?

25:22.694 --> 25:24.294
Well, it's... I'm just...

25:24.296 --> 25:26.963
I'm surprised I've
never noticed before.

25:26.965 --> 25:30.734
Even after all this time,
you're something of a...

25:30.736 --> 25:33.436
blind spot to me.

25:33.438 --> 25:36.323
You say the sweetest things.

25:36.325 --> 25:39.993
I like that
I don't see everything.

25:39.995 --> 25:42.028
It's rare.

25:43.614 --> 25:47.701
By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you, um,

25:47.703 --> 25:49.836
why haven't you told me
about your new project?

25:49.838 --> 25:52.622
We talked about the Rubens
the other day.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.925
No. The other new project.

25:54.927 --> 25:56.492
Well, the Rubens has

25:56.494 --> 25:59.662
a very... very
particular palette.

25:59.664 --> 26:02.799
The last few times we've met,
you've had flecks of paint

26:02.801 --> 26:05.185
of very different colors
on your hands.

26:05.187 --> 26:06.937
Also, the guest bedroom's

26:06.939 --> 26:10.140
been locked the last
few times I've been here,

26:10.142 --> 26:12.726
which leads me
to believe

26:12.728 --> 26:15.511
that is where
the new work resides.

26:15.513 --> 26:17.814
So...

26:17.816 --> 26:20.650
could it be
an Irene Adler original?

26:20.652 --> 26:24.187
'Cause I distinctly
remember you saying

26:24.189 --> 26:27.157
that you had absolutely nothing
to contribute to the medium.

26:27.159 --> 26:28.875
That was months ago.

26:28.877 --> 26:31.861
I feel differently now.

26:31.863 --> 26:33.696
What's changed?

26:35.532 --> 26:38.835
I really just...
I'd like to take a look at it.

26:38.837 --> 26:41.388
You'll see it when it's ready.

26:43.307 --> 26:45.208
(shower running)

26:45.210 --> 26:47.877
♪

26:49.847 --> 26:52.015
WOMAN (on TV):
Why did you come here?

26:52.017 --> 26:55.819
Can I get you anything?

26:55.821 --> 26:58.221
I'm fine, thanks.

27:01.659 --> 27:04.911
This must be
difficult for you.

27:05.913 --> 27:08.331
Sorry?

27:08.333 --> 27:10.917
Having me here.

27:12.119 --> 27:16.122
I know how much
you... see.

27:16.124 --> 27:20.076
I can only imagine what you
must be picking up right now.

27:21.946 --> 27:24.764
You know, you're the only person
I ever empathized with.

27:24.766 --> 27:26.433
Empathy.

27:26.435 --> 27:28.468
You <i>have</i> changed.

27:28.470 --> 27:31.921
(TV continues indistinctly)

27:31.923 --> 27:34.090
You asked me
the other day

27:34.092 --> 27:36.860
what my life's
been like.

27:39.730 --> 27:41.531
Um...

27:41.533 --> 27:43.400
(TV clicks off)

27:43.402 --> 27:47.737
You may recall, over the course
of our relationship, that I...

27:47.739 --> 27:51.491
dabbled with
the occasional narcotic.

27:51.493 --> 27:53.994
They were a hobby, and...

27:53.996 --> 27:56.997
after your demise they became...

27:56.999 --> 27:58.965
a good deal more than that.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.467
Yeah.

28:00.469 --> 28:02.836
A way of life, really.

28:02.838 --> 28:04.754
Sherlock...
I was...

28:04.756 --> 28:07.557
I was broken. I was...

28:07.559 --> 28:09.976
I thought the drugs
were helping,

28:09.978 --> 28:12.145
and they were not.

28:12.147 --> 28:15.765
When I couldn't find the man
who I thought had killed you,

28:15.767 --> 28:17.183
I-I just...

28:17.185 --> 28:19.019
I hit a bottom.

28:19.021 --> 28:23.473
Scotland Yard asked me
to step aside.

28:23.475 --> 28:26.443
I ended up coming here
to New York to hide.

28:26.445 --> 28:30.080
When my father realized the
depths to which I had sunk,

28:30.082 --> 28:32.983
he forced me into rehab.

28:32.985 --> 28:35.118
You're better now.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.455
I'm sober now.

28:38.457 --> 28:41.708
I'll always be an addict.

28:44.845 --> 28:48.698
I'm sorry, I, uh, I would
like to be able to say that I...

28:48.700 --> 28:50.433
honored your memory.

28:50.435 --> 28:53.169
In fact, I did
quite the opposite.

28:53.171 --> 28:56.523
Please know that I hold
myself 100% accountable

28:56.525 --> 28:58.591
for everything that
has happened to you.

28:58.593 --> 29:00.128
It is unlikely
that I will ever be able

29:00.153 --> 29:01.738
to make that up to you...

29:03.131 --> 29:07.334
but you have my word that
I will never stop trying.

29:07.336 --> 29:10.637
You were broken.

29:10.639 --> 29:13.456
You fixed yourself.

29:14.525 --> 29:16.359
If the great
Sherlock Holmes

29:16.361 --> 29:18.028
can do it, then...

29:20.364 --> 29:22.849
...you give me hope.

29:29.540 --> 29:32.058
(horns honking in distance)

29:38.182 --> 29:41.551
(door opens)

29:41.553 --> 29:43.820
(door closes)

29:45.156 --> 29:47.490
(Irene screams)

29:49.777 --> 29:51.611
He was here.

29:51.613 --> 29:54.230
Mr. Stapleton was here.

30:05.265 --> 30:07.598
IRENE (recorded):
<i>Sherlock, it's ready.</i>

30:07.600 --> 30:10.218
<i>My original piece</i>
<i>is finally ready,</i>

30:10.220 --> 30:12.837
<i>and you have an exclusive</i>
<i>invitation to view it.</i>

30:12.839 --> 30:15.273
<i>I'm out of town</i>
<i>for a few more days</i>

30:15.275 --> 30:16.791
<i>but will return on Friday.</i>

30:16.793 --> 30:18.893
<i>Meet me at my place by 5:00,</i>

30:18.895 --> 30:21.846
or into the fireplace it goes.

30:21.848 --> 30:23.848
(click)

30:25.317 --> 30:27.201
Hello?

30:27.203 --> 30:31.856
I realize I'm late, but I have
the most dazzling of excuses.

30:51.226 --> 30:54.011
I thought you were taking me
someplace safe.

30:54.013 --> 30:56.046
This is an old garage.

30:56.048 --> 30:59.267
I assure you it's a good
deal more than that.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.937
Come on.

31:03.906 --> 31:06.724
I received this property as...

31:06.726 --> 31:08.359
payment...

31:08.361 --> 31:11.529
for some work I did when
I first arrived in New York.

31:11.531 --> 31:13.898
Had intended to sell it...

31:13.900 --> 31:16.167
but then I realized...

31:16.169 --> 31:20.171
it might make a
passable safe house...

31:20.173 --> 31:21.850
in case of emergency.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.709
Are you sure we
weren't followed?

31:23.710 --> 31:26.677
I'm positive.
I followed

31:26.679 --> 31:28.579
every countersurveillance
procedure known to man,

31:28.581 --> 31:31.215
and then some known
only to me, so...

31:31.217 --> 31:33.301
I promise you, you're
quite safe here.

31:33.303 --> 31:36.003
What about your house?
Shouldn't we call the police?

31:36.005 --> 31:37.654
Well, I have done,
after a fashion--

31:37.679 --> 31:38.824
I've texted Watson.

31:38.825 --> 31:40.942
She's handling it.

31:40.944 --> 31:44.929
The scene will be...
processed.

31:44.931 --> 31:46.764
It doesn't make any sense.

31:46.766 --> 31:49.934
This... Moriarty,
he let me go.

31:49.936 --> 31:52.153
He told you were to find me,
so why would his people

31:52.155 --> 31:54.772
leave that flower on my pillow.
It was a message, obviously.

31:54.774 --> 31:56.440
Why would he
send me a message?

31:56.442 --> 31:58.776
The message was for me.

31:58.778 --> 32:00.962
It could not have
been clearer.

32:00.964 --> 32:03.164
He wants me
to understand

32:03.166 --> 32:04.430
that as long as you're
in my life,

32:04.455 --> 32:07.121
you can and
will be used against me.

32:07.537 --> 32:11.088
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met,

32:11.090 --> 32:14.291
but next to a will and
a mind like Moriarty,

32:14.293 --> 32:15.960
you're weak.

32:15.962 --> 32:19.347
And because I care for
you... I'm also weak.

32:20.899 --> 32:23.434
That's why I need
to let you go.

32:23.436 --> 32:25.903
What?

32:25.905 --> 32:29.440
I'm sorry,
you can't stay here.

32:29.442 --> 32:31.609
We need to send you...

32:31.611 --> 32:33.361
far away.

32:33.363 --> 32:37.248
Somewhere you can
really be safe.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.317
When I have finished
with Moriarty,

32:40.319 --> 32:43.037
I'll come find you.

32:43.039 --> 32:46.991
You make it sound
so easy.

32:51.263 --> 32:55.850
The notion of causing you
additional hardship...

32:55.852 --> 33:00.021
(whispers):
it pains me to my core.

33:00.023 --> 33:02.056
(whispers):
Sherlock...

33:02.058 --> 33:04.692
I'm afraid.

33:04.694 --> 33:06.777
And we've only just
found each other again

33:06.779 --> 33:09.647
after all this time.

33:09.649 --> 33:11.699
I see no other way

33:11.701 --> 33:14.018
to protect you.

33:18.790 --> 33:21.959
What if I see another way?

33:23.378 --> 33:25.646
Isaac Proctor.

33:25.648 --> 33:27.548
He changed his look,
but that's him.

33:27.550 --> 33:29.199
If there was ever any doubt
he was connected

33:29.201 --> 33:31.002
to what happened
to Ms. Adler,

33:31.004 --> 33:32.570
there isn't anymore.

33:32.572 --> 33:34.538
We got all the cameras out
of your brownstone, right?

33:34.540 --> 33:36.223
Um, all the ones
he told me about.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.676
I mean, this doesn't
make any sense.

33:38.678 --> 33:41.062
I mean, why go to
all this trouble?

33:41.064 --> 33:42.980
Why mess with Irene's head?
I mean,

33:42.982 --> 33:44.849
all the evidence says
that Isaac Proctor

33:44.851 --> 33:47.651
is a professional,
not a psychopath.

33:47.653 --> 33:49.820
I got to figure he's still
following orders, right?

33:49.822 --> 33:52.556
Right. Have you heard
from Holmes yet?

33:52.558 --> 33:54.391
I left him three messages
and a few texts.

33:54.393 --> 33:55.659
DETECTIVE:
Captain.

33:55.661 --> 33:57.895
Got Holmes for you on line one.
Okay.

33:57.897 --> 34:00.498
About time. Thank you.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.234
Holmes, where (phone chimes)
the hell are you?

34:04.236 --> 34:07.838
GREGSON:
Hello? Hello?

34:08.757 --> 34:10.741
Why didn't
he call my cell?

34:10.743 --> 34:13.010
Maybe he'll call you back.
Um, I'm gonna get a coffee.

34:13.012 --> 34:14.545
Does anyone want anything?

34:14.547 --> 34:16.464
No. No, thank you.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.750
Where's Irene?

34:19.752 --> 34:21.752
Safe.

34:21.754 --> 34:24.304
You want to explain
all the cloak and dagger?

34:24.306 --> 34:27.341
I trust Captain Gregson and
Detective Bell implicitly.

34:27.342 --> 34:29.760
But given the scope of
Moriarty's operation,

34:29.762 --> 34:31.695
the fewer people who know
about my whereabouts the better.

34:31.697 --> 34:35.232
Well, a few things you need
to be caught up on.

34:35.234 --> 34:37.266
Remember when Duane Proctor
said his brother

34:37.268 --> 34:38.936
worked at a think tank?

34:38.938 --> 34:40.154
We looked into it.

34:40.156 --> 34:42.039
Turns out it's really
a CIA front.

34:42.041 --> 34:44.074
So Isaac Proctor worked for them
as an interrogator

34:44.077 --> 34:46.543
in the late '90s--
his specialty was psychological

34:46.545 --> 34:47.928
pressure tactics.

34:47.929 --> 34:49.797
You think we may have found
our Mr. Stapleton?

34:49.799 --> 34:51.098
I know we have.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.000
Isaac was the one
who left the flower

34:53.002 --> 34:54.418
on Irene's pillow tonight.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.087
We caught him on one
of your security cameras.

34:56.089 --> 34:57.388
And I noticed something--

34:57.390 --> 34:59.390
<i>he came in</i>
<i>through the kitchen door</i>

34:59.392 --> 35:01.308
<i>and made a beeline</i>
<i>for Irene's room.</i>

35:01.310 --> 35:03.227
He knew exactly
where she was staying.

35:03.229 --> 35:05.062
How could he know that?

35:05.064 --> 35:06.931
You think that Moriarty
has-has cameras

35:06.933 --> 35:09.066
in our house, too?
Mm. I suppose with a man like him,

35:09.068 --> 35:10.651
anything is possible.
What do you mean you suppose?

35:10.653 --> 35:11.769
We need
to figure this out.

35:11.771 --> 35:14.655
I'm leaving New York, Watson.

35:14.657 --> 35:15.990
What?

35:17.142 --> 35:18.976
I told Irene that,
in order to be safe,

35:18.978 --> 35:20.361
she needed to go elsewhere.

35:20.363 --> 35:22.312
She said she would only do so

35:22.314 --> 35:25.032
if I accompanied her, so...

35:25.034 --> 35:27.535
I came to say good-bye.

35:27.537 --> 35:29.186
I don't understand.

35:29.188 --> 35:30.988
How-how long will you be gone?

35:30.990 --> 35:32.823
That's difficult
to say.

35:32.825 --> 35:35.793
If you could dismantle
Moriarty's empire in my absence,

35:35.795 --> 35:37.294
thereby guaranteeing
Irene's safety,

35:37.296 --> 35:40.131
that would go a long way
to expediting my return.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.766
Is this what you want or is this
what you think you owe?

35:42.768 --> 35:44.768
I don't think I owe anything.
I know it.

35:44.770 --> 35:47.805
Her life was ruined
because of me.

35:47.807 --> 35:49.506
We are on
to something here.

35:49.508 --> 35:51.775
We can find Isaac Proctor
and that might

35:51.777 --> 35:54.011
lead us to Moriarty.
I'm sorry, Watson.

35:54.013 --> 35:55.696
My mind is made up.

35:55.698 --> 35:57.364
This is what
Moriarty wants,

35:57.366 --> 36:00.117
and if it's what he wants,
it's a mistake.

36:29.181 --> 36:31.232
Were you followed?
No.

36:34.102 --> 36:37.488
The plates are clean.
There's $30,000 and a phone

36:37.490 --> 36:40.057
in the glove compartment.
You drive to Calgary,

36:40.059 --> 36:41.892
and you wait.

36:41.894 --> 36:44.561
The next instructions you're
gonna get are on the burner,

36:44.563 --> 36:46.997
so... stay close to it.

36:46.999 --> 36:49.667
Will I be allowed to call home?

36:49.669 --> 36:52.503
(sirens wailing)

36:54.289 --> 36:56.006
Think this through.

36:56.008 --> 36:58.408
If you kill me...
Shut up.

36:59.211 --> 37:01.045
(sirens stop)

37:01.047 --> 37:03.413
"Call home."

37:03.415 --> 37:05.599
You voice-activated one phone
to call the other.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.251
Metal drum in the trunk.

37:07.253 --> 37:09.720
You were gonna use it
to get rid of my body.

37:09.722 --> 37:11.305
Whose idea?

37:11.307 --> 37:12.940
You were sloppy.

37:12.942 --> 37:14.108
The police should
never have been able

37:14.110 --> 37:15.976
to trace that house
back to you,

37:15.978 --> 37:17.261
but they did.

37:17.263 --> 37:19.196
Moriarty can't abide that.

37:19.198 --> 37:21.782
(shouts) Moriarty thinks
I was sloppy?

37:21.784 --> 37:24.485
Who left standing orders never
to hurt Sherlock Holmes?

37:24.487 --> 37:26.253
Only reason you're
still breathing

37:26.255 --> 37:28.706
is so you can report back.
(groans)

37:28.708 --> 37:30.658
Moriarty's obsessed with Holmes.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.326
Doesn't want him touched.

37:32.328 --> 37:34.161
You tell Moriarty

37:34.163 --> 37:37.831
that Sherlock Holmes
is a dead man.

37:40.335 --> 37:42.953
Irene?

37:42.955 --> 37:45.506
I didn't think
you'd be gone so long.

37:45.508 --> 37:47.291
I've been busy.

37:47.293 --> 37:50.344
We have a way out.

37:50.346 --> 37:52.629
No one will know
that we've gone.

37:52.631 --> 37:54.732
And they won't know
how to find us...

37:54.734 --> 37:56.267
once they do.

37:56.269 --> 37:58.602
There's a Greyhound to Maine.

37:58.604 --> 38:01.488
I have a friend there
who can get us some passports.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.691
Then the trick will be
conscripting a boat

38:03.693 --> 38:05.142
to take us to Newfoundland.

38:05.144 --> 38:06.277
Once we're at
St. John's Airport,

38:06.279 --> 38:07.477
virtually any
destination...

38:08.313 --> 38:10.247
What?

38:10.249 --> 38:12.199
Is that as far as you've gotten?

38:12.201 --> 38:14.034
It's all right.

38:14.036 --> 38:17.254
We don't need to have every move
mapped out 20 steps in advance.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.923
We can work it out as we...

38:21.376 --> 38:23.377
Sherlock?

38:23.379 --> 38:24.962
What the hell
are you doing?

38:24.964 --> 38:27.514
Get off of me!

38:29.000 --> 38:30.301
Why would you do that?

38:30.303 --> 38:32.853
(panting):
How...

38:32.855 --> 38:35.105
How could I have been so stupid?

38:35.107 --> 38:38.525
Sherlock, you're scaring me.

38:38.527 --> 38:40.861
How long have you been
working for him?

38:40.863 --> 38:42.146
What?

38:42.148 --> 38:43.147
Moriarty.

38:43.149 --> 38:44.514
How long...

38:44.516 --> 38:46.066
have you been working...

38:46.068 --> 38:47.701
for Moriarty?

38:47.703 --> 38:50.621
You're not making any sense.
Your constellation,

38:50.623 --> 38:53.107
<i>Auriga...</i>

38:53.109 --> 38:56.026
One of the stars is missing.
What?

38:56.028 --> 38:59.046
Your birthmarks. You-you've had
one surgically removed.

38:59.048 --> 39:01.365
I don't know what...

39:01.367 --> 39:03.533
Your birthmarks!

39:06.004 --> 39:09.056
Was it, was it,
was it precancerous, huh?

39:09.058 --> 39:11.809
So you had it removed.

39:11.811 --> 39:15.095
<i>You</i> had it removed, not
Moriarty, because why would he?

39:15.097 --> 39:17.064
Why would he care?

39:17.066 --> 39:18.599
Hmm?

39:20.185 --> 39:22.052
When did it start?

39:24.055 --> 39:27.024
When... did it start?

39:27.026 --> 39:29.360
Was it before
your abduction?

39:29.362 --> 39:31.728
Was everything a lie?!

39:31.730 --> 39:33.530
I've never lied to you.

39:33.532 --> 39:35.949
You get like this.
You get like this.

39:35.951 --> 39:38.068
You look at a thing
so closely

39:38.070 --> 39:41.238
you start to see things
that aren't there.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.624
You know you do.

39:43.626 --> 39:47.077
If you can't trust anyone,

39:47.079 --> 39:49.913
if you can't trust <i>me...</i>

39:49.915 --> 39:52.416
please...

39:52.418 --> 39:55.886
don't do this.

39:55.888 --> 39:59.440
Watson asked me.
She said... she said...

39:59.442 --> 40:03.560
she says how is it
that Isaac Proctor knew

40:03.562 --> 40:07.147
exactly which was your room
in the brownstone.

40:07.149 --> 40:09.366
And now we know.

40:09.368 --> 40:12.602
Because you told Moriarty.

40:12.604 --> 40:13.937
You lied before.

40:13.939 --> 40:15.939
You don't really want
to come with me,

40:15.941 --> 40:18.325
so you're inventing
a reason not to.

40:19.494 --> 40:21.462
You know...

40:21.464 --> 40:23.464
it's funny.

40:23.466 --> 40:26.216
I close my eyes
and I try to picture him,

40:26.218 --> 40:29.887
and I see someone
an awful lot like you.

40:31.339 --> 40:33.841
I think you do, too.

40:33.843 --> 40:35.676
I think if you
weren't so bent

40:35.678 --> 40:37.845
on being your enemy,

40:37.847 --> 40:40.063
he'd be your friend.

40:42.517 --> 40:46.487
When you realize the
mistake you've made,

40:46.489 --> 40:48.689
don't try and find me.

40:48.691 --> 40:53.026
I don't <i>ever</i> want
to see you again.

(beep) Watson, change of plan.
I'm not going anywhere.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.434
There's much we need to discuss.
I've returned

41:31.436 --> 41:33.286
to the brown...

41:33.288 --> 41:35.038
(silenced gunshot)
(grunts)

41:35.040 --> 41:37.407
I apologize, Mr. Holmes.

41:37.409 --> 41:40.076
You weren't supposed
to see it coming. (groaning)

41:40.078 --> 41:42.545
(grunting):
Mr. Proctor.

41:42.547 --> 41:44.664
I was wondering when I was going
to make your acquaintance.

41:44.666 --> 41:46.549
Actually,

41:46.551 --> 41:47.750
we met once before...

41:47.752 --> 41:50.887
(grunting)

42:04.685 --> 42:06.853
(panting)

42:08.489 --> 42:11.607
(groans)

42:14.528 --> 42:16.696
(glass shatters)
(shouts)

42:17.665 --> 42:18.865
(silenced gunshots)

42:20.534 --> 42:22.535
You know you're only
prolonging the inevitable.

42:22.537 --> 42:25.338
You said
we've met before, but...

42:25.340 --> 42:27.340
I never forget a face.

42:27.342 --> 42:28.841
I had you at a disadvantage.

42:28.843 --> 42:31.160
<i>I was looking at you</i>
<i>through a sniper scope.</i>

42:32.012 --> 42:34.497
So why kill me now?

42:34.499 --> 42:36.516
Not then?
(silenced gunshots)

42:36.518 --> 42:38.217
(grunts, groans)

42:41.722 --> 42:42.972
(shouts)

42:43.274 --> 42:45.608
I was under orders
that day.

42:45.610 --> 42:47.643
Moriarty said you weren't
to be harmed.

42:47.645 --> 42:50.997
But then, a few hours ago,
she tried to have me killed.

42:50.999 --> 42:53.115
(panting):
"She"?

42:53.117 --> 42:55.618
(gunshots)

43:10.166 --> 43:12.385
(British accent): Bet you wish
you'd run away with me

43:12.387 --> 43:14.603
when you had the chance.

43:15.472 --> 43:17.673
Moriarty.

43:28.492 --> 43:30.693
This isn't how-- or when--

43:30.695 --> 43:32.762
I wanted to reveal myself
to you.

43:34.247 --> 43:36.999
But Mr. Proctor
forced the issue.

43:37.001 --> 43:39.118
(panting)

43:39.120 --> 43:40.486
This is a ruse.

43:40.488 --> 43:43.706
(panting):
You...

43:46.893 --> 43:49.512
So who was the man
I spoke to on the phone,

43:49.514 --> 43:51.663
who, uh...
said he was Moriarty?

43:51.665 --> 43:53.899
You talked to
one of my lieutenants.

43:53.901 --> 43:55.935
He has, over the years,
played the role repeatedly

43:55.937 --> 43:57.553
and with great conviction.

43:57.555 --> 43:59.004
More often than not,
he's done so

43:59.006 --> 44:00.806
to protect my identity.

44:00.808 --> 44:02.775
Other times, it was
because I suspected

44:02.777 --> 44:07.646
a potential client might...
struggle... with my gender.

44:07.648 --> 44:10.282
As if men had
a monopoly on murder.

44:11.868 --> 44:14.070
(grunts, pants)

44:14.988 --> 44:16.405
What if I don't believe you?

44:16.407 --> 44:18.857
You don't want to believe me.

44:18.859 --> 44:21.460
And yet your legendary
powers of observation

44:21.462 --> 44:24.380
are screaming that I'm telling
the truth right now.

44:24.382 --> 44:26.165
Why would you do this?

44:26.167 --> 44:29.368
Seduce me, and...

44:29.370 --> 44:31.554
lead me to believe
that you'd been murdered?

44:31.556 --> 44:34.507
You're the detective, Sherlock.
You tell me.

44:34.509 --> 44:36.392
Well, I must have interrupted
one of your plans

44:36.394 --> 44:38.477
when I was still working
at Scotland Yard.

44:38.479 --> 44:40.696
Try <i>several</i> plans.

44:41.982 --> 44:43.733
A series of assassinations

44:43.735 --> 44:46.352
I'd planned meticulously.

44:46.354 --> 44:48.404
Punishment, then.

44:48.406 --> 44:50.906
My first instinct
was to kill you.

44:50.908 --> 44:52.724
Quietly.

44:52.726 --> 44:54.193
Discreetly.

44:57.781 --> 44:59.498
But then, the more
I learned about you,

44:59.500 --> 45:01.233
the more curious I became.

45:02.169 --> 45:04.170
Here, at last,

45:04.172 --> 45:07.339
seemed to be a mind that...
that rivaled my own,

45:07.341 --> 45:10.593
something too complicated
and too beautiful to destroy...

45:10.595 --> 45:13.129
at least without
further analysis.

45:13.131 --> 45:18.300
So I devised a way
to study you...

45:18.302 --> 45:19.969
in your own environment.

45:19.971 --> 45:21.387
(groans)

45:22.939 --> 45:25.691
You became "Irene""

45:25.693 --> 45:26.892
Imagine my surprise

45:26.894 --> 45:28.861
when I realized
how much we had in common.

45:28.863 --> 45:30.379
I have about as much
in common with you

45:30.381 --> 45:31.647
as I do a dung beetle.

45:31.649 --> 45:34.099
I can understand
why you would think so.

45:34.101 --> 45:38.871
I know how much pride you take
in your uniqueness.

45:38.873 --> 45:42.908
But the truth is,
I see everything you do.

45:44.277 --> 45:45.544
I feel it.

45:45.546 --> 45:48.414
Makes the world
quite dull, no?

45:48.416 --> 45:50.249
Looking at a man,

45:50.251 --> 45:52.001
and knowing
all his secrets.

45:52.003 --> 45:53.419
So you're saying
we're the same.

45:53.421 --> 45:55.954
I'm saying I'm better.

45:59.259 --> 46:02.461
And that's why I let you live,
back in London.

46:02.463 --> 46:05.764
You were not the threat
you had been made out to be.

46:05.766 --> 46:09.485
So I concluded my experiment
and resumed my business.

46:09.487 --> 46:12.304
You proceeded to prove
you were inferior

46:12.306 --> 46:14.607
by disappearing into a syringe.

46:14.609 --> 46:16.075
Hmm.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.862
Why resurface in New York?

46:21.281 --> 46:22.748
I'd heard of your...

46:22.750 --> 46:26.368
your miraculous recovery,
and I...

46:26.370 --> 46:28.871
I was curious to see
how far you'd come.

46:29.989 --> 46:31.657
That's bollocks.

46:31.659 --> 46:33.992
Returning to me is a risk,
and you'd only take it

46:33.994 --> 46:38.681
if I was close to undermining
another of your plots.

46:38.683 --> 46:40.716
That is why you wanted me
to lea the country

46:40.718 --> 46:42.301
with you earlier,
was it not?

46:42.303 --> 46:44.770
Same old Sherlock.

46:44.772 --> 46:46.805
You look at people
and you see puzzles.

46:46.807 --> 46:50.109
I see games.

46:50.111 --> 46:51.360
You?

46:51.362 --> 46:54.029
You're a game
I'll win every time.

46:54.031 --> 46:57.900
You might as well just
kill me now, 'cause...

46:57.902 --> 47:01.687
whatever it is
you came here to do...

47:01.689 --> 47:03.239
I'll stop you.

47:03.241 --> 47:05.324
I would never kill you.

47:05.326 --> 47:08.160
(chuckles)

47:08.162 --> 47:10.195
Not in a million years.

47:10.197 --> 47:12.665
You may not be as unique
as you thought, darling,

47:12.667 --> 47:14.133
but you're still a work of art.

47:14.135 --> 47:15.668
I appreciate art.

47:17.420 --> 47:19.805
What I-I can do...

47:19.807 --> 47:22.341
what I will do...

47:25.178 --> 47:28.547
...is hurt you.

47:28.549 --> 47:32.101
Worse than I did before.

47:32.103 --> 47:37.823
I have reserves of creativity
I haven't even begun to tap.

47:37.825 --> 47:40.326
So please...

47:40.328 --> 47:42.828
for you own good...

47:45.165 --> 47:47.232
...let me win.

47:58.578 --> 48:00.012
(groans)

48:05.685 --> 48:08.137
HOLMES:
Watson, you're here.

48:08.139 --> 48:09.421
Excellent.

48:09.423 --> 48:11.757
There's so much
I need to tell you.

48:11.759 --> 48:13.025
WATSON:
This is stupid.

48:13.027 --> 48:14.977
You should be
in the hospital right now.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.396
(groans)
Told you there isn't time.

48:17.398 --> 48:19.431
Besides, what's the point of
living with a former surgeon

48:19.433 --> 48:21.450
if she can't stitch the
occasional bullet hole?

48:21.452 --> 48:23.619
The muscle in your shoulder
is shredded, okay?

48:23.621 --> 48:25.321
You need to be treated
for the pain. (grunts)

48:25.323 --> 48:28.374
May I remind you I am
a recovering drug addict?

48:28.376 --> 48:30.042
May I remind you that
there is such a thing

48:30.044 --> 48:31.493
as non-addictive painkillers?

48:31.495 --> 48:33.162
How good can they be
if they're non-addictive?

48:33.164 --> 48:34.463
Anyway...

48:34.465 --> 48:35.798
if I'm gonna deduce

48:35.800 --> 48:37.549
what Irene is up to
in New York,

48:37.551 --> 48:39.969
I'm gonna need every
last one of my faculties.

48:39.971 --> 48:41.920
(sighs)

48:41.922 --> 48:44.807
I'm sorry about Irene.

48:44.809 --> 48:47.125
Or... Moriarty--
whatever her name is.

48:47.127 --> 48:50.312
I actually found the truth
quite liberating.

48:50.314 --> 48:51.930
I've wanted the answers
to Irene's murder

48:51.932 --> 48:53.465
for a long time.

48:53.467 --> 48:55.267
Now I have them.

48:55.269 --> 48:58.237
And she erred when she revealed
herself to me this morning.

48:58.239 --> 48:59.855
Thanks to her...

48:59.857 --> 49:02.808
I now have perfect clarity.

49:02.810 --> 49:05.844
You've never seen me
with perfect clarity.

49:05.846 --> 49:07.746
Okay.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.450
Irene is Moriarty.

49:11.452 --> 49:13.669
You think she's here
to do something terrible.

49:13.671 --> 49:15.987
You have a hole
in your shoulder,

49:15.989 --> 49:19.091
and we have a dead assassin
on the third floor of our home.

49:21.044 --> 49:23.161
So, where would you
like to start?

49:29.168 --> 49:32.354
So Isaac Proctor shot you.

49:32.356 --> 49:34.490
And then your ex-girlfriend
shot him.

49:34.492 --> 49:37.276
Except...
Irene's not really Irene.

49:37.278 --> 49:39.978
She's, uh, some kind of...

49:39.980 --> 49:42.314
what, mastermind?

49:42.316 --> 49:44.485
Very good, Captain.
You have it all straight.

49:44.510 --> 49:45.351
I can't believe

49:45.352 --> 49:47.903
I'm-I'm saying this,
but I'll tell our people

49:47.905 --> 49:51.356
to be on the lookout for--
I guess Irene Adler

49:51.358 --> 49:53.409
is an alias.
Well, she goes by Moriarty,

49:53.411 --> 49:55.794
but we're not sure
if that's her real name.

49:55.796 --> 49:57.830
HOLMES: It's all very well
to be on the lookout,

49:57.832 --> 49:59.030
but you're dealing with someone

49:59.032 --> 50:01.133
who is capable
of meticulous planning

50:01.135 --> 50:04.136
and extremes of self-discipline.
If you do find her,

50:04.138 --> 50:06.672
the only crime she's committed
is shooting that man,

50:06.674 --> 50:08.724
who was... shooting me.

50:08.726 --> 50:10.309
So where do we start looking?

50:10.311 --> 50:12.261
I don't know.

50:12.263 --> 50:14.480
But if we're gonna learn,
we need to determine

50:14.482 --> 50:16.682
what she's been doing
in New York the past few weeks.

50:16.684 --> 50:19.268
At the moment, all we have
are pieces of what appears to be

50:19.270 --> 50:21.052
a larger plan.

50:21.054 --> 50:22.604
The scheme to take over
the Taggart Speakeasy,

50:22.606 --> 50:23.906
the arrest of the principal of

50:23.908 --> 50:25.524
Sutter Risk Management
for murder,

50:25.526 --> 50:28.193
but so far none of it adds
up to a coherent whole.

50:28.195 --> 50:29.995
(sighs)

50:29.997 --> 50:32.397
We're not gonna learn much
from Isaac Proctor's body.

50:32.399 --> 50:34.666
If Irene-- oh--
(clears throat)

50:34.668 --> 50:38.236
I suppose I should get used
to calling her... Moriarty--

50:38.238 --> 50:41.757
she took his phone
and his wallet.

50:41.759 --> 50:43.092
Hmm.

50:43.094 --> 50:45.377
WATSON:
Did you find something?

50:47.430 --> 50:49.298
Who-Who-Whose items are these?

50:49.300 --> 50:51.850
Couple of homicide victims
that came in last night.

50:51.852 --> 50:53.969
Uh, one of them's
got Cyrillic tats.

50:54.854 --> 50:56.588
We think
it's gang-related.

50:56.590 --> 50:57.890
Why?

50:57.892 --> 50:59.308
These cell phones.

50:59.310 --> 51:01.927
They've been modified
so someone could install

51:01.929 --> 51:03.729
an open-source
operating system

51:03.731 --> 51:05.981
in lieu of the one
that the phone comes with.

51:05.983 --> 51:09.660
We've seen this kind
of modification twice recently.

51:09.661 --> 51:11.621
Sebastian Moran,
Daniel Gottlieb.

51:11.622 --> 51:14.123
Every time we deal
with one of Moriarty's people,

51:14.125 --> 51:16.825
someone's done the same kind
of jailbreak on their phone.

51:16.827 --> 51:19.294
I don't think those deaths
are gang-related.

51:19.296 --> 51:22.965
I think this man was
in open warfare with Moriarty.

51:22.967 --> 51:24.750
He's your killer.

51:24.752 --> 51:26.117
Oh, hold on.

51:26.119 --> 51:28.187
All that we got
is two cell phones.

51:28.189 --> 51:30.288
We don't have any
proof that those guys

51:30.290 --> 51:32.641
were-were working
for Moriarty.

51:32.643 --> 51:34.977
Yes, we do.

51:34.979 --> 51:36.178
GREGSON:
That's the same code

51:36.180 --> 51:38.230
on Moran and Gottlieb's phone.

51:38.232 --> 51:41.767
It's a code that I know
how to break.

51:41.769 --> 51:47.022
"B... N... 2... 3""

51:49.108 --> 51:51.142
"Macedonian Sun"?

51:51.144 --> 51:52.361
What does that mean?

51:52.363 --> 51:53.912
Haven't the foggiest.

51:53.914 --> 51:56.147
But it's nice
to have a handhold.

52:02.138 --> 52:04.322
(pen clatters)

52:05.658 --> 52:08.427
GREGSON:
<i>See, to me, it seems simple.</i>

52:08.429 --> 52:12.264
I mean, Holmes just found out
he's been manipulated for years.

52:12.266 --> 52:14.216
Guy's got to
be devastated.

52:14.218 --> 52:17.769
Plus, he's refusing medical
attention for a gunshot wound?

52:17.771 --> 52:20.772
I mean, I understand
he's invested in the case,

52:20.774 --> 52:23.508
but the NYPD doesn't
do vendettas.

52:23.510 --> 52:26.812
If he was one of my detectives,
I'd bench him.

52:26.814 --> 52:28.780
Look, I understand
why you're worried,

52:28.782 --> 52:30.399
but if he can't look for Irene,

52:30.401 --> 52:32.284
if he has to marinate
in his mistakes--

52:32.286 --> 52:35.120
I think I know him
pretty well by now--

52:35.122 --> 52:38.957
that could be the one thing
that pushes him over the edge.

52:39.792 --> 52:42.527
If I think
he needs to stop,

52:42.529 --> 52:45.631
I'll tell you.

52:48.501 --> 52:50.302
(over speaker):
I know what it means.

52:50.304 --> 52:51.803
The message.

52:51.805 --> 52:54.890
The <i>Macedonian Sun</i>
is a container ship

52:54.892 --> 52:56.708
licensed to operate out
of Bay 23 North

52:56.710 --> 52:58.644
at the Port of New York
and New Jersey.

52:58.646 --> 53:01.146
It is part of a fleet
of Hellenic Exporters,

53:01.148 --> 53:02.764
which is a company owned by...

53:02.766 --> 53:05.584
Christos Theophilus.

53:05.586 --> 53:07.102
Oh, well,
I've heard that name.

53:07.104 --> 53:09.187
Perhaps you remember him best
by his nickname...

53:09.189 --> 53:11.890
the Narwhal.
Narwhal.

53:11.892 --> 53:14.059
Like the whale with
a horn on its head?

53:14.061 --> 53:15.494
Yes, precisely.

53:15.496 --> 53:18.163
Now, during the late '80s,
early '90s,

53:18.165 --> 53:21.700
Interpol believed that he was
one of Europe's most prolific

53:21.702 --> 53:23.735
maritime smugglers,
but he was elusive--

53:23.737 --> 53:26.588
they could never, in fact,
prove that he was... a criminal.

53:26.590 --> 53:29.341
Now, by all accounts, he dropped
out of the smuggling trade

53:29.343 --> 53:32.410
some time ago and has since
remade himself as the...

53:32.412 --> 53:33.762
the legitimate head

53:33.764 --> 53:35.547
of an international
shipping conglomerate

53:35.549 --> 53:39.301
and a noted contributor
to Greek nationalist charities.

53:39.303 --> 53:40.802
So you're wondering

53:40.804 --> 53:42.604
if he really remade himself

53:42.606 --> 53:43.922
or if he's working for Moriarty.

53:43.924 --> 53:45.440
He has hundreds of boats

53:45.442 --> 53:47.442
circumnavigating the globe
at any given time.

53:47.444 --> 53:49.144
He would be a very useful

53:49.146 --> 53:52.030
partner to an international
arranger of assassinations.

53:52.032 --> 53:53.899
He could move personnel,
weaponry

53:53.901 --> 53:55.600
with little chance of detection.

53:55.602 --> 53:59.955
Now, the <i>Macedonian Sun</i> is due
in port this very evening.

53:59.957 --> 54:02.391
(gulls squawking,
ship's horn blows)

54:04.160 --> 54:06.161
WATSON: I think
it's been a while

54:06.163 --> 54:07.629
since a few of us have eaten.

54:07.631 --> 54:09.298
There's a roach coach
a couple blocks away.

54:09.300 --> 54:11.449
I'm gonna get some burgers.
You want anything?

54:11.451 --> 54:14.285
Coffee, please.
(door opens)

54:16.639 --> 54:19.391
How you doing?

54:21.678 --> 54:25.130
I mean, all the stuff
you're dealing with,

54:25.132 --> 54:27.983
it's next level.

54:27.985 --> 54:29.651
You know, to think
that that lady

54:29.653 --> 54:32.270
would mess with your head,
to this degree...

54:32.272 --> 54:36.575
I know it must seem strange.

54:36.577 --> 54:39.494
But, uh, tell you the truth...

54:39.496 --> 54:43.782
I've come to believe it might
be a good thing in the long run.

54:43.784 --> 54:45.584
Good thing?
Yeah.

54:45.586 --> 54:49.037
Must be some interesting
math you're doing.

54:49.039 --> 54:53.342
Well, I've never had
a nemesis before.

54:53.344 --> 54:56.211
Not a proper one.

54:56.213 --> 54:59.765
Quite looking forward to it.

54:59.767 --> 55:03.935
I imagine it to be
tremendously energizing.

55:09.776 --> 55:13.178
Hey, the ship's
unloaded.

55:13.180 --> 55:15.230
We didn't see
anything unusual,

55:15.232 --> 55:18.483
so we were thinking
maybe time to go home.

55:18.485 --> 55:21.203
Yes, I understand.

55:21.205 --> 55:22.954
There are lives to return to.

55:22.956 --> 55:25.690
I will keep vigil here
on my own till morning.

55:25.692 --> 55:28.359
Hold up.
Look at that.

55:37.437 --> 55:40.038
(ship's horn blowing)

55:42.592 --> 55:45.343
HOLMES:
The Narwhal himself. This is it.

55:45.345 --> 55:47.429
Whatever that boat
has brought for Moriarty,

55:47.431 --> 55:50.232
that man is here to pick it up.

55:50.234 --> 55:53.235
(sirens wailing)

55:53.237 --> 55:54.486
(sirens stop)

55:54.488 --> 55:55.854
BELL:
NYPD!

55:57.190 --> 55:58.824
(officers shouting)

55:58.826 --> 56:01.559
Don't move! Don't move!

56:01.561 --> 56:04.329
CHRISTOS: This is my boat.
What are you doing?

56:04.331 --> 56:06.581
You just unloaded
a smuggled crate from it.

56:06.583 --> 56:08.784
I want to see
what's inside.

56:23.349 --> 56:26.251
You said Moriarty
might be using that boat

56:26.253 --> 56:28.419
to smuggle weapons or personnel.

56:28.421 --> 56:30.755
Tell me which one
these two are.

56:32.525 --> 56:35.227
(chattering)

56:46.584 --> 56:48.735
I've never in my life heard
the name Moriarty.

56:48.737 --> 56:50.070
Narwal, stop lying to us.

56:50.072 --> 56:52.039
You know, my client
has asked several times

56:52.041 --> 56:53.907
that you not refer
to him as "Narwhal."

56:53.909 --> 56:55.709
I don't know why
it bothers him.

56:55.711 --> 56:57.845
They're lovely creatures--
the unicorns of the sea.

56:57.847 --> 57:00.097
It bothers me because
it's a name from another time.

57:00.099 --> 57:02.800
I am not that man.
BELL: Not a smuggler?

57:02.802 --> 57:04.918
It's an interesting position,
considering we just caught you

57:04.920 --> 57:07.016
smuggling two lemurs
into the country.

57:07.017 --> 57:09.841
Okay, look,
my daughter, Alethea--

57:09.842 --> 57:12.109
animals are near
and dear to her,

57:12.111 --> 57:14.862
and she married a man
who feels the same way.

57:14.864 --> 57:17.965
They've been getting more and
more involved in conservation,

57:17.967 --> 57:22.069
and me-- I'm just a man
who can't say no to his kid.

57:22.071 --> 57:24.938
You're telling me those
lemurs are for your daughter?

57:24.940 --> 57:27.458
They were poached,

57:27.460 --> 57:29.609
and they were being
auctioned off

57:29.611 --> 57:31.962
to men who would
strip them of parts

57:31.964 --> 57:34.614
like an old car.

57:38.119 --> 57:40.087
My girl and her husband--

57:40.089 --> 57:42.422
they live on a horse ranch
in Westchester.

57:42.424 --> 57:44.641
They will take good care
of them.

57:44.643 --> 57:46.059
WATSON:
So, you're running

57:46.061 --> 57:47.478
an underground railroad

57:47.480 --> 57:48.595
for endangered species?

57:48.597 --> 57:50.481
BELL:
Can your daughter

57:50.483 --> 57:51.565
corroborate all this?

57:51.567 --> 57:53.484
She is on vacation in Kenya.

57:53.486 --> 57:56.136
But her husband
is out there.

57:56.138 --> 57:58.138
He will show you.

57:58.140 --> 58:00.240
Well... it's gonna
take a while

58:00.242 --> 58:02.809
to get out to Westchester
this time of day.

58:02.811 --> 58:04.444
I'm gonna call ahead
to the local cops,

58:04.446 --> 58:06.029
let 'em know
we're coming.

58:06.031 --> 58:08.315
I assume this is a call
you can make while driving.

58:08.317 --> 58:10.150
We are not going anywhere
until we change your bandage.

58:10.152 --> 58:11.502
Watson...
No. Like I said yesterday,

58:11.504 --> 58:12.704
I'm only going along with this

58:12.705 --> 58:14.505
if you let me monitor
your wound.

58:14.507 --> 58:16.874
Fine. Make your call from here,
we'll meet you at the car.

58:16.876 --> 58:18.792
Thanks. Appreciate it.

58:18.794 --> 58:21.128
Oh, there's no
sign of infection,

58:21.130 --> 58:22.796
so that's good.

58:22.798 --> 58:24.181
Less talking, Watson,
more tending.

58:24.183 --> 58:25.999
Okay. What's the
pain like today?

58:26.001 --> 58:27.801
It's fine. It's barely
even noticeable.

58:27.803 --> 58:30.020
Give me a number--
one to ten.

58:30.022 --> 58:31.522
Pi.

58:31.524 --> 58:32.856
It's a mathematical constant

58:32.858 --> 58:34.341
that is approximately
equal to...

58:34.343 --> 58:36.476
three point one four.
Three point one four, yes.

58:36.478 --> 58:38.529
If you're saying the
pain is about three,

58:38.531 --> 58:40.531
I don't believe you.
Hmm.

58:40.533 --> 58:43.850
You said you need all of
your faculties to stop Moriarty.

58:43.852 --> 58:46.236
Seems like you're a few
short at the moment.

58:46.238 --> 58:49.522
(ringtone playing)

58:49.524 --> 58:50.824
Hello?

58:50.826 --> 58:52.326
MAN:
Hey, Joanie, it's me.

58:52.328 --> 58:53.877
Oh, hey, Oren.

58:53.879 --> 58:55.963
Don't freak out,
but I've got some bad news.

58:55.965 --> 58:58.048
Mom slipped and fell
in some store this morning.

58:58.050 --> 58:59.499
Oh, my God.

58:59.501 --> 59:01.168
She's okay.
She just bumped her head.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.554
One of the ER doctors
used Mom's cell to call me.

59:03.556 --> 59:05.639
But I'm at a conference
in Barcelona this week.

59:05.641 --> 59:07.707
I was hoping
you could go check on her.

59:07.709 --> 59:09.092
Of course.

59:09.094 --> 59:10.710
She's at Chandler Memorial.

59:10.712 --> 59:13.013
Okay, I will call you
once I get there.

59:13.015 --> 59:14.398
Okay, bye.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.216
You Watson women
and your heels.

59:16.218 --> 59:17.734
Your mother's
in her early 60s.

59:17.736 --> 59:19.886
Should have resigned herself
to flats years ago.

59:19.888 --> 59:21.554
You heard all that?
Yup.

59:21.556 --> 59:23.607
It's not like
I'm on any pain medication

59:23.609 --> 59:26.226
that might dull my senses.

59:26.228 --> 59:30.230
Look, if she's okay, I will meet
you in Westchester in an hour.

59:30.232 --> 59:33.533
I'll wait with baited breath.

59:33.535 --> 59:35.135
Your mother is fine.

59:35.137 --> 59:37.120
I'm the one
who called your brother.

59:37.122 --> 59:39.873
I apologize
for the subterfuge,

59:39.875 --> 59:41.675
but it seemed
the most expedient way

59:41.677 --> 59:43.410
to get you away from Sherlock.

59:43.412 --> 59:46.013
What do you want?

59:46.015 --> 59:50.767
Why... the pleasure
of your company, of course.

59:53.587 --> 59:56.740
(piano playing, crowd chatter)

59:56.742 --> 59:58.976
You're not afraid of me?

59:58.978 --> 01:00:02.262
Too angry to be afraid.

01:00:02.264 --> 01:00:05.032
Maybe just because
we're in a crowded restaurant.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.566
Over the course of my career,

01:00:06.568 --> 01:00:08.101
I've plotted exactly
seven murders

01:00:08.103 --> 01:00:10.287
that were carried out
in crowded restaurants.

01:00:10.289 --> 01:00:12.656
Killing you here
is far from impossible.

01:00:12.658 --> 01:00:14.574
It's just not what I want.

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:16.410
Why am I here?

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.412
Because he took
an interest in you.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:20.163
I'd like to understand why.

01:00:20.165 --> 01:00:21.782
'Cause you find him
so fascinating.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:24.301
What was the word
that you used the other night?

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:26.003
Mm. Work of art.

01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:30.457
Far as I can determine,
you're a sort of... mascot.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.560
You were his sober companion,

01:00:33.562 --> 01:00:37.431
a professional angel to perch
on his shoulder, fend off

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.965
his many demons, but now...

01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:41.468
now I don't know what you are.

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:44.137
(whispering):
Do you want to sleep with him?

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:48.492
I thought you told him
that you were just like him.

01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:52.829
That you saw
the same things that he did.

01:00:52.831 --> 01:00:55.198
Well, women can be a little bit
more difficult to read.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.649
Just ask Sherlock.

01:00:56.651 --> 01:00:58.702
(laughs)

01:00:58.704 --> 01:01:01.204
I asked him to allow me
to complete my business

01:01:01.206 --> 01:01:02.706
in New York without interfering.

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:05.342
He doesn't appear
to be complying.

01:01:07.512 --> 01:01:10.013
Last night, you helped him
surveil a certain ship.

01:01:10.015 --> 01:01:12.466
This morning, he questioned
a certain businessman?

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.017
How do you know about that?

01:01:14.019 --> 01:01:15.435
Surely by now you appreciate

01:01:15.437 --> 01:01:16.770
the scope of my organization.

01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:18.221
I have eyes and ears

01:01:18.223 --> 01:01:19.973
in the most fascinating
of places.

01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:22.526
(phone chimes)

01:01:24.178 --> 01:01:26.780
Hmm.

01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:32.869
Business.

01:01:36.124 --> 01:01:40.127
Talk to Sherlock.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:42.862
Tell him I'll only be here
for a few more days.

01:01:42.864 --> 01:01:44.831
After that,
he can have his city back.

01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:48.201
He can have this whole
insipid country back.

01:01:49.754 --> 01:01:53.173
You're afraid of him.

01:01:53.175 --> 01:01:56.927
If you weren't, you wouldn't
have gone to so much trouble.

01:01:59.097 --> 01:02:01.598
My dear Watson,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.652
I'm afraid of what
he might force me to do.

01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:12.492
MAN: <i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>why my father-in-law</i>

01:02:12.494 --> 01:02:14.194
<i>told you what we do here,</i>

01:02:14.196 --> 01:02:16.997
but if you know, you know.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.201
This is a working
horse ranch.

01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:24.037
We board,
we give lessons...

01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:25.439
There are also

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.175
22 different
endangered species being

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.909
cared for on the grounds.

01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:33.096
22 different kinds of
smuggled property, you mean?

01:02:33.098 --> 01:02:34.464
We're not concerned about
your impromptu game reserve.

01:02:34.466 --> 01:02:36.099
It's a lovely hobby.

01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:38.268
I would relish the chance
to spend an afternoon here.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.303
Unfortunately,
our business is pressing.

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:42.755
My principal concern
is your wife.

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:45.758
Well-well, why are you
concerned about Alethea?

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.261
Quite an undertaking--
your Kenyan safari.

01:02:48.263 --> 01:02:51.448
Strange for one spouse
to leave the other behind.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.099
Don't you think?

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.202
My wife's a
free spirit.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.770
Separate vacations have
always been part of the deal.

01:02:57.772 --> 01:02:59.239
What are you doing?

01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:00.991
Far be it for me to, yeah,

01:03:00.993 --> 01:03:02.826
speculate on the state
of your marriage,

01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:04.744
but I looked
in your coat closet,

01:03:04.746 --> 01:03:08.415
and I saw it was full of, uh,
top-of-the-line outerwear.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:10.383
His and hers.

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:14.120
Gets quite brisk on the veldts
of Kenya, doesn't it?

01:03:14.122 --> 01:03:16.756
So, any idea why
she left her gear behind?

01:03:16.758 --> 01:03:18.558
Oh.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.312
You know, she probably...
got the latest thing.

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:23.730
Hey!

01:03:23.732 --> 01:03:25.649
(murmuring)

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:27.267
Yeah.

01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:30.320
Hey, this is a prescription
for Levothyroxine.

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:33.273
That's a synthetic hormone
used to treat thyroiditis.

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:35.909
This prescription was filled
by your wife nearly a month ago.

01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:38.478
Yet, there are only 18 pills
missing from this bottle.

01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:41.481
She's failed

01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:46.036
to take her rather crucial
medication for almost a week.

01:03:46.038 --> 01:03:48.588
Where's your wife, Mr. Lerberg?

01:03:50.808 --> 01:03:53.960
A week ago, like you say.

01:03:53.962 --> 01:03:55.962
It was the middle
of the night.

01:03:55.964 --> 01:03:59.516
Two guys in masks broke
into the house. They...

01:03:59.518 --> 01:04:02.719
They took Alethea.

01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:07.607
(gasps)

01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:09.676
My father-in-law gets
out here, he cuts me loose,

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:12.445
he tells me the kidnappers have
already been in touch with him.

01:04:12.447 --> 01:04:14.614
He's supposed
to handle everything.

01:04:14.616 --> 01:04:16.483
No cops, or she's dead.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.184
What can you tell us
about these two men?

01:04:18.186 --> 01:04:19.619
Not much.

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:21.121
They were all covered up.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:24.023
Uh... one guy's sleeve rode up.

01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:27.694
I saw he had tattoos in, uh...

01:04:27.696 --> 01:04:30.413
What's that alphabet called?
Cyrillic.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.886
Sounds like it could be the
two guys we have in the morgue.

01:04:35.888 --> 01:04:38.255
I'll call the captain.

01:04:44.929 --> 01:04:47.547
(sighs)

01:04:51.018 --> 01:04:53.320
(ringtone playing)

01:04:57.825 --> 01:05:01.194
Watson... it's been
quite a productive errand.

01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:04.197
(panting)

01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:05.865
What?

01:05:05.867 --> 01:05:09.624
<i>You should never</i>
have gotten in that car, Watson.

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.922
Excuse me, but the henchman
she was with had a gun.

01:05:11.924 --> 01:05:13.621
And you know what?
This is not my fault.

01:05:13.646 --> 01:05:14.625
I don't know
why you're blaming me.

01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:16.126
You've fallen behind
on your self-defense studies.

01:05:16.128 --> 01:05:19.212
A gun which remains unpulled
cannot be brought to bear on a situation.

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:21.348
You weren't there, okay, so, you
have no idea what it was like...

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.749
GREGSON: Uh, enough!
...when he came at me with the gun.

01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:24.250
Enough! You're both getting

01:05:24.252 --> 01:05:26.886
your own security details
until this all blows over,

01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:29.255
and I'm putting a couple of guys
at your residence, too.

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:32.092
Now, Theophilus made bail
right after you left

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.395
for Westchester,
but he's not at his apartment.

01:05:35.397 --> 01:05:37.364
His lawyer
and his bail bondsman have

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:39.566
no idea where he is.
The Narwhal has fled.

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:42.068
If he'd wanted to tell us that
his daughter had been kidnapped,

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.737
he had his chance to tell us
this morning.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:47.824
So Theophilus
isn't Moriarty's accomplice;

01:05:47.826 --> 01:05:50.210
he's her victim.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:52.629
I don't get it.

01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:55.248
All this just to snatch
some rich guy's daughter?

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:57.116
There's more to it.
There has to be.

01:05:57.118 --> 01:06:00.220
Moriarty has... flair.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.255
She pursues projects
which ignite her passions.

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:05.392
It is very difficult to imagine
that her grand plan in America

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:09.796
is something as prosaic
as a kidnapping for ransom.

01:06:11.899 --> 01:06:14.017
Excuse me for a moment.

01:06:17.805 --> 01:06:19.322
WATSON:
Hey, you okay?

01:06:19.324 --> 01:06:21.274
Yeah, I'm fine. The pain
is quite intense at times,

01:06:21.276 --> 01:06:22.742
but it's nothing
I can't handle.

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:24.678
Spirit of the Dam-Busters
and all that.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.312
BELL: Hey.

01:06:26.314 --> 01:06:28.698
So, I had our CCS guys
look for evidence

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.084
of communication between
Theophilus and the kidnappers.

01:06:31.086 --> 01:06:33.319
Now, his computer
seemed clean at first

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:35.488
but one of the techs figured out
that he'd just signed up

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.040
for a new e-mail account
a week ago.

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:39.325
Had him send me
a screen-cap of the inbox.

01:06:39.327 --> 01:06:41.795
WATSON:
Question mark.

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.596
That was the caller I.D.
that came up

01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:45.998
when Moriarty called Daniel
Gottlieb's phone to talk to us.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.551
Now, the e-mails were encrypted
with a public key code--

01:06:48.553 --> 01:06:51.104
can't be broken-- but Theophilus
did download something

01:06:51.106 --> 01:06:53.306
at the exact same time
one of 'em came in.

01:06:53.308 --> 01:06:56.226
It was on his hard drive.
That, we can get at.

01:06:57.128 --> 01:06:58.344
You don't know who this is?

01:06:58.346 --> 01:06:59.863
WATSON:
Why would Moriarty

01:06:59.865 --> 01:07:03.015
send that picture to Theophilus?

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:08.204
Mr. Theophilus.

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:14.994
It's nice to finally meet
face-to-face.

01:07:14.996 --> 01:07:18.298
You are the one who
took my daughter.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.701
Oh, I had some help.

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:29.876
In all my years of smuggling,
I never handled one of these.

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:32.762
It's simple.
You just point and shoot.

01:07:32.764 --> 01:07:35.381
Repeatedly.

01:07:43.524 --> 01:07:48.244
It's important in moments
like these to remember Alethea.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.247
(inhales deeply)

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.868
I have your word

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.937
that you will let her go when
I have done what you asked.

01:07:57.939 --> 01:08:00.072
Of course.

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:05.745
Then you have my word.

01:08:07.098 --> 01:08:11.351
This man and his family will
be dead by tomorrow night.

01:08:21.758 --> 01:08:22.518
(Holmes shouting)

01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:24.643
Sherlock!

01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:27.930
Sherlock!
(grunting) Morning.

01:08:27.932 --> 01:08:30.265
You're slamming your hand
into your bullet wound.

01:08:30.267 --> 01:08:32.118
I was having problems staying
awake and I tried reasoning

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.569
with my hypothalamus, but...

01:08:33.571 --> 01:08:35.437
in the end,
it required corporal punishment.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.238
Well, there are police officers
standing outside. I'm surprised

01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:38.657
they didn't kick the door down.
Yes, they are waiting

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:40.274
to take us
to a would-be murder victim.

01:08:40.277 --> 01:08:42.627
Actually, it's been
a long night, Watson,

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:46.131
but a productive one-- I believe
I have deduced Moriarty's plan.

01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:47.332
You're kidding.

01:08:49.553 --> 01:08:53.589
Right. This man
is named Andrej Bacera.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:55.725
His mother is presently

01:08:55.727 --> 01:08:57.792
the Speaker of Parliament
of the Republic

01:08:57.795 --> 01:09:00.261
of Macedonia.
She's a noted reformer,

01:09:00.264 --> 01:09:02.098
popular figure.
Mr. Bacera himself,

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.683
something of a favorite son
in his homeland.

01:09:04.685 --> 01:09:06.352
So why is Moriarty
interested

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:08.319
in a couple
of Macedonian politicians?

01:09:08.322 --> 01:09:10.156
Andrej Bacera is not
a politician.

01:09:10.158 --> 01:09:14.026
Not yet. He works as a vascular
surgeon here in New York.

01:09:14.028 --> 01:09:17.779
Serves as an unofficial diplomat
when needed. Now...

01:09:17.782 --> 01:09:20.448
I refer you to a
map of the Balkan

01:09:20.451 --> 01:09:21.500
Peninsula. This...

01:09:21.502 --> 01:09:23.536
is the Republic of Macedonia,

01:09:23.537 --> 01:09:24.819
a fledgling democracy
and applicant

01:09:24.822 --> 01:09:25.787
for full membership

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:27.256
to the European Union.

01:09:27.258 --> 01:09:29.175
Biggest obstacle
to its candidacy

01:09:29.176 --> 01:09:31.660
is its ongoing dispute
with its neighbor--

01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:32.845
Greece--

01:09:32.846 --> 01:09:34.662
over the very name "Macedonia."

01:09:34.665 --> 01:09:36.549
I thought Macedonia
was part of Greece.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:39.100
Macedonia is a
region in Greece,

01:09:39.103 --> 01:09:40.435
birthplace
of Alexander the Great,

01:09:40.438 --> 01:09:42.438
area of enormous
historical import,

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:44.506
so you can imagine
Greece's chagrin

01:09:44.508 --> 01:09:47.777
when Yugoslavia broke apart
and one small new nation

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:50.029
declared itself the
Republic of Macedonia.

01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:52.180
Two of my cousins both wanted
to name their sons Henry.

01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:53.616
It was a big thing
at Thanksgiving.

01:09:53.618 --> 01:09:54.784
What are you getting at?

01:09:54.786 --> 01:09:57.236
Well, as long
as Macedonia insists

01:09:57.238 --> 01:09:58.871
on calling itself Macedonia,

01:09:58.873 --> 01:10:00.873
Greece has pledged to remain
intractably opposed

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:02.825
to admitting them to the EU.

01:10:02.827 --> 01:10:05.878
However,
Andrej Bacera's mother...

01:10:07.764 --> 01:10:10.583
...recently brokered
a compromise on the issue.

01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:12.718
WATSON: "In a few days, the current
Republic of Macedonia

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.920
"is going to vote
on whether to join the EU

01:10:14.922 --> 01:10:16.589
as the Republic
of New Macedonia."

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.391
So they just added the word "New."
It worked.

01:10:19.393 --> 01:10:21.560
Referendum is expected
to pass handily.

01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:24.096
So, this is all very fascinating
in an NPR kind of way,

01:10:24.098 --> 01:10:27.049
but I don't see how your nemesis
is gonna look at all this and...

01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:28.383
and see an opportunity.

01:10:28.385 --> 01:10:29.985
Which is why you make
a much better companion

01:10:29.987 --> 01:10:31.904
than you do a nemesis.

01:10:31.906 --> 01:10:34.190
It's all about currency.
This...

01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:35.274
is a Macedonian denar.

01:10:35.276 --> 01:10:37.359
You just had this lying around?

01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:38.744
If the Macedonian
referendum passes,

01:10:38.746 --> 01:10:40.579
the currency will switch
to the euro.

01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:42.397
The denar will become obsolete,
absolutely worthless.

01:10:42.399 --> 01:10:45.451
And yet not 48 hours ago,
a Swiss bank,

01:10:45.453 --> 01:10:47.953
acting on behalf
of an enormous client,

01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:50.572
purchased an enormous position
in the currency.

01:10:50.574 --> 01:10:52.091
Why would anyone buy
into a currency

01:10:52.093 --> 01:10:53.792
that's about to become extinct?

01:10:53.794 --> 01:10:56.512
They would not. Not unless they
planned to manipulate events

01:10:56.514 --> 01:10:59.098
to prevent Macedonia
from joining the EU.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.582
Imagine the uproar...

01:11:01.434 --> 01:11:03.302
...if a native of Greece,

01:11:03.304 --> 01:11:05.271
someone known
to make contributions

01:11:05.273 --> 01:11:07.089
to nationalist causes

01:11:07.091 --> 01:11:10.926
murdered Macedonia's favorite
son on the eve of the vote.

01:11:10.928 --> 01:11:12.561
Old passions
would be inflamed.

01:11:12.563 --> 01:11:14.897
The vote to rename
the country would fail,

01:11:14.899 --> 01:11:18.150
and the denar would remain
the currency of Macedonia.

01:11:18.152 --> 01:11:20.102
Its value would soar.

01:11:20.104 --> 01:11:22.538
So Moriarty kidnapped
the Narwhal's daughter

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.874
to force him
to kill this man.

01:11:24.876 --> 01:11:27.793
All so she could make some
money on a currency bet.

01:11:27.795 --> 01:11:29.611
Nearly a billion dollars.

01:11:30.714 --> 01:11:33.716
What say we go stop this bitch?

01:11:33.718 --> 01:11:35.885
Jordan?

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.453
Jordan?

01:11:38.455 --> 01:11:40.005
Where's Jordan?

01:11:40.007 --> 01:11:41.473
Andrej, what's wrong?

01:11:41.475 --> 01:11:44.293
Jordan, there's a New York
police captain

01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:46.512
on the phone-- he says
there's a man coming to kill me.

01:11:48.815 --> 01:11:50.983
This is Jordan Conroy.

01:11:50.985 --> 01:11:52.634
I handle security
for the Baceras.

01:11:52.636 --> 01:11:55.070
Mr. Conroy, this is
Captain Gregson with the NYPD.

01:11:55.072 --> 01:11:56.972
Is it just you there
or do you have a team?

01:11:56.974 --> 01:11:58.357
It's just me. Why?

01:11:58.359 --> 01:11:59.825
We have reason to believe

01:11:59.827 --> 01:12:01.393
Mr. Bacera's being targeted

01:12:01.395 --> 01:12:05.447
by a Greek national by the name
of Christos Theophilus.

01:12:05.449 --> 01:12:07.833
We're actually on our way
to you right now.

01:12:07.835 --> 01:12:09.335
Can you give me a description?

01:12:09.337 --> 01:12:11.086
He's a white male, six feet,

01:12:11.088 --> 01:12:13.005
about 190. I texted a photograph

01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:15.291
to Mr. Bacera.

01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:16.992
We've got a safe room here.
Top of the line.

01:12:16.994 --> 01:12:20.162
I'll get Mr. and Mrs. Bacera
inside it right away.

01:12:29.005 --> 01:12:31.173
(doorbell rings)

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.977
(lock buzzes, gate creaks open)

01:12:34.979 --> 01:12:37.863
We need to do
this quickly.

01:12:37.865 --> 01:12:40.032
(keypad beeping)

01:12:43.236 --> 01:12:45.454
Step outside.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.074
Uh...

01:12:49.076 --> 01:12:50.993
wh-what you really want,

01:12:50.995 --> 01:12:54.747
you can have it. Please...
Now.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.755
(panting)

01:13:04.057 --> 01:13:05.808
Jordan?

01:13:10.897 --> 01:13:12.481
What's going on here?

01:13:12.483 --> 01:13:16.018
What have you done?
Jordan, please...

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.604
please help us.

01:13:29.866 --> 01:13:33.335
OPERATOR:
911, what's your emergency?

01:13:33.337 --> 01:13:35.954
My name is Christos Theophilus.

01:13:35.956 --> 01:13:37.956
I'm in the house of the snake,

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:41.593
Andrej Bacera.

01:13:41.595 --> 01:13:42.961
What I do now...

01:13:42.963 --> 01:13:45.597
I do for the love
of my country.

01:13:45.599 --> 01:13:47.683
ANDREJ:
Please...

01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:48.967
Please, I'm-I'm begging you...

01:13:48.969 --> 01:13:53.022
(Jovana screaming)
(bodies thud)

01:13:59.979 --> 01:14:02.114
(phone ringing)

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.940
Poppa? It's me. I'm okay.

01:14:11.942 --> 01:14:14.209
Poppa? Are you there?
(shuddering breath)

01:14:14.211 --> 01:14:17.463
They just left me in front
of the farm and drove away.

01:14:17.465 --> 01:14:18.947
I'm with Chad now.

01:14:18.949 --> 01:14:21.467
The police are on their way.
(shuddering breath)

01:14:21.469 --> 01:14:24.086
Are you there?

01:14:24.088 --> 01:14:26.088
(shuddering breath)

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.841
Do it now. Please.

01:14:31.594 --> 01:14:33.495
JORDAN:
<i>Right after I hung up,</i>

01:14:33.497 --> 01:14:35.864
I was struck from behind.

01:14:35.866 --> 01:14:38.567
Next thing I know I'm zip tied
to the banister

01:14:38.569 --> 01:14:41.520
and he's taking Andrej
and Jovana into the bedroom.

01:14:41.522 --> 01:14:43.322
I managed to get free,

01:14:43.324 --> 01:14:46.992
but then... I heard
the first two shots.

01:14:46.994 --> 01:14:48.610
I had a gun

01:14:48.612 --> 01:14:50.645
in my ankle holster
that he hadn't spotted.

01:14:50.647 --> 01:14:52.281
I grabbed it.

01:14:52.283 --> 01:14:55.000
I made my way into the room.

01:14:55.002 --> 01:14:56.752
I fired...

01:14:56.754 --> 01:14:58.954
but not before he'd shot
Mrs. Bacera.

01:14:58.956 --> 01:15:00.956
Captain, don't listen to a word
this man says.

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:02.868
Holmes, I thought you
were still at the scene.

01:15:02.893 --> 01:15:03.877
Mr. Conroy,

01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:05.177
how long have you been
working with Moriarty

01:15:05.179 --> 01:15:06.428
and how long
has she been planning this?

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:08.597
GREGSON:
Hey. Hey.

01:15:08.599 --> 01:15:10.516
Do you want to tell me
what's going on here?

01:15:10.518 --> 01:15:14.169
Yeah. I had a chance to peruse
Mr. Conroy's curriculum vitae

01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:16.522
while I was
at the Bacera residence.

01:15:16.524 --> 01:15:18.023
Currently under the employ

01:15:18.025 --> 01:15:20.192
of a company called Lexicon
Personal Security, yes?

01:15:20.194 --> 01:15:22.361
Would you like to know
what that company was called

01:15:22.363 --> 01:15:23.979
until just a week ago?

01:15:23.981 --> 01:15:25.680
Sutter Risk Management.

01:15:25.682 --> 01:15:27.866
We think it's one of Moriarty's
shell corporations.

01:15:27.868 --> 01:15:29.851
Am I supposed to know that name?
She used me

01:15:29.853 --> 01:15:31.353
to prove that the Sutters
had committed a murder,

01:15:31.355 --> 01:15:32.871
most likely to clear
the decks for you.

01:15:32.873 --> 01:15:35.357
You were not assigned
to Mr. and Mrs. Bacera

01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:37.359
a few weeks ago, were you?
You joined their detail

01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:41.046
just recently, a move no doubt
orchestrated by your new owner.

01:15:41.048 --> 01:15:43.549
I would've given my life
for the Baceras.

01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:45.334
You let a murderer
into their home,

01:15:45.336 --> 01:15:47.869
and then you murdered him
to cover it up.

01:15:47.871 --> 01:15:50.005
(grunting)

01:15:50.007 --> 01:15:51.423
Sherlock!
Get off him!

01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:55.010
No!
Get... get him out of here.

01:15:55.012 --> 01:15:57.429
Ow!
(shouts)

01:15:57.431 --> 01:15:59.348
(sighs)

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.049
You're bleeding again.

01:16:01.051 --> 01:16:02.818
You must've popped your stitches.
I'm fine.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.553
Sherlock...
I said I'm fine!

01:16:04.555 --> 01:16:06.271
Hey! You need
to get a hold of yourself!

01:16:06.273 --> 01:16:09.057
(panting)

01:16:09.059 --> 01:16:11.743
I had her. I had her. I...

01:16:11.745 --> 01:16:12.727
uncovered her plan,

01:16:12.729 --> 01:16:13.946
saw how to stop her

01:16:13.948 --> 01:16:15.781
and she succeeded.

01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:17.907
Three people died today
because of me.

01:16:17.932 --> 01:16:18.751
Are you listening to me?

01:16:18.752 --> 01:16:21.453
Captain Gregson wanted to pull
your credentials a few days ago.

01:16:21.455 --> 01:16:22.871
I convinced him not to.

01:16:22.873 --> 01:16:24.756
Yes, because you know
that a good detective

01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:27.125
doesn't just stop because things
get inconvenient!

01:16:28.211 --> 01:16:30.762
Sherlock...

01:16:30.764 --> 01:16:32.080
I think it's time.

01:16:32.082 --> 01:16:33.715
For what?!

01:16:33.717 --> 01:16:35.417
You-you know
I'll investigate this anyway,

01:16:35.419 --> 01:16:37.386
whether I have Captain Gregson's
blessing or not.

01:16:37.388 --> 01:16:39.605
That is your choice,
but right now, we are

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:41.089
enabling you.

01:16:41.091 --> 01:16:43.775
If you are the partner
that I invited you to be,

01:16:43.777 --> 01:16:46.261
the partner that I believe
that you can be,

01:16:46.263 --> 01:16:48.564
then you will stop this line
of thought immediately!

01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:49.931
I am your partner,

01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:51.433
and you cannot keep
going on like this!

01:16:51.435 --> 01:16:53.068
Now, what...?
You know, I almost stole

01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:54.987
a vial of opiates
from a crime scene yesterday.

01:16:54.989 --> 01:16:57.122
(sighs)

01:16:58.274 --> 01:17:00.659
You know why I didn't?
Because of you.

01:17:00.661 --> 01:17:04.279
Because I knew how disappointed
that you would be in me.

01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:08.333
And if I only had the words to
describe how disappointed in you

01:17:08.335 --> 01:17:11.637
I am at the moment...

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:19.177
I don't expect you
to understand right now,

01:17:19.179 --> 01:17:22.314
but I know what you need to do.

01:17:23.483 --> 01:17:26.435
Moriarty said she
was smarter than you,

01:17:26.437 --> 01:17:28.303
that you needed
to let her win.

01:17:28.305 --> 01:17:31.473
It is the only way this
does not eat you alive.

01:17:32.609 --> 01:17:35.027
She was right.

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:36.478
(panting)

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.497
Let her win.
(sighs heavily)

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:43.252
Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know
if he shows up.

01:17:43.254 --> 01:17:45.820
Um, give me a minute.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.258
Hey.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:51.176
Aren't you meant to
be waiting outside?

01:17:51.178 --> 01:17:52.544
I just talked
to the sergeant

01:17:52.546 --> 01:17:54.212
in charge
of your protective detail.

01:17:54.214 --> 01:17:56.765
He told me you ditched him
outside the precinct.

01:17:56.767 --> 01:17:58.166
What's the deal?

01:17:58.168 --> 01:17:59.551
You okay?

01:17:59.553 --> 01:18:01.219
Going upstairs to shower.

01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:04.022
Surely your jurisdiction
ends there.

01:18:32.385 --> 01:18:34.970
(phone ringing)

01:18:36.038 --> 01:18:38.140
What's up, Captain?

01:18:38.142 --> 01:18:40.875
GREGSON: Holmes stormed out
of the station a while back.

01:18:40.877 --> 01:18:42.260
Is he there?

01:18:42.262 --> 01:18:44.062
Yeah, he just got in.

01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:45.764
What about Watson?
Is she with him?

01:18:45.766 --> 01:18:48.233
No. What's going on?

01:18:48.235 --> 01:18:50.124
A corner drug dealer in Bushwick

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:53.493
got beaten and robbed
about a half hour ago.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:55.695
Witnesses said
the perp was British,

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.964
and his arm was in a sling.

01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:02.719
Holmes?

01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:04.220
Let me in.

01:19:04.222 --> 01:19:05.538
(water running)

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.707
Come on, open up!

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:10.143
(sighs)

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.879
(water running)

01:19:13.636 --> 01:19:17.071
Holmes? Can you hear me?

01:19:17.073 --> 01:19:19.156
Hmm? Hey, get an ambulance now.

01:19:19.158 --> 01:19:20.741
He just OD'd.

01:19:20.776 --> 01:19:23.528
(Holmes gasps)
Stay with me. Hey. Hey. Holmes.

01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:32.437
(monitor beeping)

01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:33.889
(door closes)

01:19:33.891 --> 01:19:35.474
(Holmes sighs)

01:19:35.776 --> 01:19:37.859
IRENE:
I know you're awake.

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:40.829
I appreciate you're
cross with me, but...

01:19:40.831 --> 01:19:43.465
please don't tell
me I've managed

01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:45.801
to make the great
Sherlock Holmes shy.

01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:50.872
(sighs)

01:19:50.874 --> 01:19:53.258
There's a guard at my door.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.094
I haven't hurt him,
just distracted him.

01:19:56.096 --> 01:19:58.547
Ah.

01:19:58.549 --> 01:20:00.415
I warned you.

01:20:00.417 --> 01:20:03.351
I practically begged you.

01:20:05.254 --> 01:20:07.772
Why didn't you listen?

01:20:07.774 --> 01:20:10.142
(laughs)

01:20:10.144 --> 01:20:12.760
You asked me to let you win.

01:20:14.096 --> 01:20:16.748
I'd say that I have really.

01:20:18.484 --> 01:20:22.604
You compelled
Christos Theophilus to murder

01:20:22.606 --> 01:20:25.290
two innocent people
this morning.

01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:28.710
And then you made a fortune
in the resulting chaos.

01:20:28.712 --> 01:20:32.297
I did,
but I didn't want... this.

01:20:32.299 --> 01:20:34.466
Not again.

01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:37.135
Yeah.

01:20:37.137 --> 01:20:39.054
Why did you come here?

01:20:42.592 --> 01:20:44.976
I want to help you.

01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:47.812
You-you adopted
a fake persona,

01:20:47.814 --> 01:20:50.232
you seduced me,

01:20:50.234 --> 01:20:52.651
faked your own death...

01:20:52.653 --> 01:20:55.303
so, forgive me

01:20:55.305 --> 01:20:59.140
if I, uh... if I don't want
any more of your help.

01:20:59.142 --> 01:21:00.909
Would you have preferred
I'd just killed you?

01:21:02.995 --> 01:21:05.647
Yes.

01:21:09.585 --> 01:21:13.371
I knew that my death
would be quite a blow.

01:21:13.373 --> 01:21:16.174
I knew it would keep
you occupied while I...

01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:18.793
carried on with other projects,

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.829
but I...

01:21:21.831 --> 01:21:26.718
I failed to predict your
descent into addiction.

01:21:28.504 --> 01:21:30.805
Well, you surprised me.

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:34.192
You're the only person
on the planet who can.

01:21:34.194 --> 01:21:36.895
That's why you love me,
though, isn't it?

01:21:38.013 --> 01:21:40.315
Is that why
you came here?

01:21:40.317 --> 01:21:42.567
To tell me?

01:21:46.689 --> 01:21:49.541
Do you know why
you're so drawn to narcotics?

01:21:49.543 --> 01:21:52.911
Because you're in near
constant pain.

01:21:52.913 --> 01:21:56.331
Your sensitivities-- they
make you a great detective,

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.667
but they also hurt you.

01:21:58.669 --> 01:22:02.387
I know what that's like,
Sherlock.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:04.923
Only me.

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.677
I'm leaving the country tonight.

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:11.096
I want you to come with me.

01:22:13.649 --> 01:22:16.551
You're broken
to pieces right now.

01:22:16.553 --> 01:22:19.738
I can put you back together.

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:24.559
And once you're whole, I'll show
you a different way to live.

01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:29.080
(sighing):
We are... the same.

01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:31.950
You and I.

01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:35.903
We both made the same mistake.

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:40.842
We fell in love.

01:22:43.112 --> 01:22:44.846
It made us stupid.

01:22:44.848 --> 01:22:46.631
I made nearly
a billion dollars today.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:48.099
I don't feel stupid.

01:22:48.101 --> 01:22:49.434
(laughs)

01:22:49.436 --> 01:22:52.920
(sighs, quietly):
Yeah.

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:56.775
You know...

01:22:56.777 --> 01:22:59.277
she solved you.

01:22:59.279 --> 01:23:01.980
The <i>mascot.</i>

01:23:03.733 --> 01:23:06.368
Watson.

01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:07.952
She diagnosed your...

01:23:07.954 --> 01:23:12.040
condition earlier this evening.

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:14.409
(sighs)

01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:18.713
She realized the real reason
you could never...

01:23:18.715 --> 01:23:22.634
quite bring yourself to kill me.

01:23:22.636 --> 01:23:25.170
The reason
you came back to my life.

01:23:27.256 --> 01:23:31.259
Ah... the reason
you came here.

01:23:31.261 --> 01:23:35.347
That's why she encouraged me
to let you win.

01:23:39.068 --> 01:23:41.969
Well, at least make it...

01:23:41.971 --> 01:23:45.857
yeah... make-make it <i>look</i>
like you'd won.

01:23:49.311 --> 01:23:51.279
You faked the overdose.

01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:54.982
Yeah. Uh...

01:23:54.984 --> 01:23:56.984
I remain quite drug-free.

01:23:56.986 --> 01:23:59.120
It's good.

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:01.589
(sniffles)

01:24:01.591 --> 01:24:04.509
But, um... (sniffles)

01:24:06.512 --> 01:24:08.847
...given your, um...

01:24:08.849 --> 01:24:11.850
your repeated claims
to have your...

01:24:13.552 --> 01:24:16.721
...eyes and...
eyes and ears everywhere...

01:24:16.723 --> 01:24:19.891
You said...

01:24:19.893 --> 01:24:23.611
there was only one person in the
world who could surprise you.

01:24:23.613 --> 01:24:27.849
Turns out, there's two.

01:24:27.851 --> 01:24:30.402
(door opens)

01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:33.037
♪

01:24:37.827 --> 01:24:40.528
♪

01:24:45.835 --> 01:24:47.168
(buzzing)

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:48.887
WATSON:
Hey, there you are.

01:24:48.889 --> 01:24:51.873
Captain Gregson just called
with an update about Moriarty.

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:53.591
And?

01:24:53.593 --> 01:24:56.210
Well, he said the recording the
police made of your conversation

01:24:56.212 --> 01:24:59.431
at the hospital has her attorney
sweating bullets.

01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:01.733
They know that she admitted
to using Christos Theophilus

01:25:01.735 --> 01:25:04.102
to kill the Baceras, so,
they're treading lightly.

01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:05.687
In the meantime,

01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:07.739
the Macedoanian
denars she purchased

01:25:07.741 --> 01:25:10.224
have been frozen,
pending further investigation.

01:25:10.226 --> 01:25:14.696
Hey... are you listening to me?

01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:16.881
My nemesis has been defeated.

01:25:16.883 --> 01:25:19.417
Is that about the long
and the short of it?

01:25:19.419 --> 01:25:21.085
Yes.

01:25:21.904 --> 01:25:23.421
Yes.

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:27.742
So, does that mean you need
to find a new nemesis,

01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:30.345
or is this more
of a lifetime appointment?

01:25:33.766 --> 01:25:36.117
They're almost here.

01:25:36.119 --> 01:25:40.087
Do you remember the
rare bee I was given

01:25:40.089 --> 01:25:42.724
for proving that Gerald Lydon
had been poisoned?

01:25:42.726 --> 01:25:46.144
The bee in the box, sure.

01:25:46.146 --> 01:25:49.263
<i>Osmia avoseta</i> is
its own species,

01:25:49.265 --> 01:25:52.150
which means it should not
be able to reproduce

01:25:52.152 --> 01:25:54.101
with other kinds of bees.

01:25:54.103 --> 01:25:57.539
And yet,
nature is infinitely wily.

01:25:57.541 --> 01:26:01.292
So box bee got
another bee pregnant?

01:26:01.294 --> 01:26:03.444
Quite so.

01:26:03.446 --> 01:26:05.446
Which means,
they should be reclassified

01:26:05.448 --> 01:26:07.415
as an entirely new species.

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:09.968
First newborn of which...

01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:14.622
is about to crawl its
way into sunlight.

01:26:14.624 --> 01:26:16.958
Oh, my God.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.460
As the discoverer
of the species,

01:26:19.462 --> 01:26:24.649
the privilege of naming
the creatures falls to me.

01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:28.736
Allow me to introduce you
to <i>Euglassa Watsonia.</i>

01:26:32.825 --> 01:26:34.976
You named a bee after me?

01:26:36.278 --> 01:26:38.980
♪

01:26:42.117 --> 01:26:43.985

01:26:47.156 --> 01:26:50.508

more within the hour.

If you'd like, I could come and
get you once they're all here.

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.300
